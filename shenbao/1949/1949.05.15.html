<h3>上海外郊戰事益烈　突入月浦楊行間共軍全部殲滅　松江撤守·黃渡對峙中</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據軍方十四日下午九時發佈戰訊：</p>
<p>（一）今日下午一時匪約一個師，自嘉定增援，向我月浦楊行一帶國軍陣地再度猛犯，守軍某部當採取主動奮勇出擊，力予痛殲，戰鬥至為慘烈，除月浦一帶匪二個警已被我全數殲滅外，楊行方面亦斃傷匪三千餘，遺屍累累，堆積如山，我軍士氣極旺，無不爭先衝殺，現劇戰仍在繼續展開中。</p>
<p>（二）崑山目我主動轉移後，現尙在黃渡對峙中。</p>
<p>（三）月浦以西地區，十四日上午九時發生激戰，我軍在砲空掩護下，向來犯之匪痛擊，斃匪無數，並俘匪七八百人，午後五時，匪復向我月浦陣地猛犯，當經守軍派隊還擊，匪未能得逞，遺屍漬逃。</p>
<p>（四）楊行西西沈港有匪廿九軍一個團，向西移動，企圖不明。</p>
<p>（五）劉行北太平橋以北公路西側，有匪廿八軍兩個團構築工事，我陸空軍正協同殲滅中。</p>
<p>（六）十四晚十一時匪約兩梱師開始全面攻擊獅子林至月浦之綫。又，月浦楊行之綫匪約兩個師兵力，同時向我陣地猛攻，刻戰鬥正猛烈展開中。</p>
<p>（七）十四日下午月浦·楊行間陣地，曾被匪一小部衝入，經國軍砲兵猛烈反擊，當將突入之匪全部殲滅，陣地無恙。</p>
<p>（八）十四日晚自黃昏起，國軍在獅子林·月浦·楊行·劉行之綫發動全面進攻，經海陸砲隊及戰車部隊協同劉軍英勇進擊，已將來犯匪全部擎退，迄晚十一時，匪全面攻勢已遭頓挫，是役傷斃匪甚夥，生俘二百餘名。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方十四日上午十一時消息：松江守軍，已於十三日二時主動轉移。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方十四日上午十時消息：十一日我游剿部隊，在陳墓附折湖沼地帶斃匪卅餘，俘廿餘，據獲步檐四十五支，輕機槍一挺，望遠鏡一具，電話機一部。</p>
<h3>空軍日夜不斷出事　出動飛機共達二百餘架　戰果豐碩斃共軍近萬人</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕空軍總部息：今日為上海外郊保衛戰之第二日，陸海空三軍聯合以全力保衛上海，空軍全日廿四小時晝夜出擊，總計出動飛機二百餘架在上海週圍戰綫，仍以吳淞西北之月浦楊行戰鬥最烈，兩鎭均由國軍堅守，以衛據大上海吞吐口吳淞要塞區。十四日零時迄微明，共軍在月浦楊行發動攻勢三次，均被國軍擊退，陸單及停泊吳淞口之海軍軍艦，為壓制共軍攻勢，澈夜協同發砲，射擊來犯之共軍，空軍於夜間亦派出飛機凌空助戰，至晨五時起，月浦楊行外圍上空，卽由我機不斷前往炸射，致使匿藏太倉·嘉定·顧家宅·沈巷宅·川心宅·盛家橋·新鎭等村鎭之共軍，被炸斃者近萬人，炸毀卡車八十輛，砲兵陣地七處，馬百餘匹，木船百餘只，碉堡三處，前綫工事十餘處。</p>
<p>今日空軍除集中主力炸射獅子林，月浦，楊行以北之共軍，獲得以上戰果外，復以百餘架機羣，廣泛在大上海外園巡邏炸射，計獲主要職果為：</p>
<p>（一）蘇州到崑山公路上唯亭站附近，野馬式戰鬥機發現共軍運彈藥卡車隊廿餘輛，經掃射後當塲車隊爆炸，祇剩卡車六輛，公路路面到處炸成彈坑，此低飛之野馬式機，亦幾被震墜。</p>
<p>（二）嘉興東行來嘉善，松江，以及由松江向上海行進之共軍，經空軍發現有三萬人，炸斃其三千餘人。</p>
<p>（三）今日在金山衡全公亭登陸之共單大木船十二艘，載共軍千五百人登陸，被炸斃五百人。</p>

<p>（五）常熟境公路上炸燬共軍黑色指揮轎車三輛。</p>
<p>又訊：十四日晚七時起，共軍又開始其連續三夜之對上海夜間攻勢，大上海保衛戰重點，仍在月浦，楊行，劉行外圍，陸海軍以砲擊對抗來犯之共軍，以陣地阻遏共軍對此區撲進，空軍亦派出大批飛機，於暗夜中出動，前往上空制壓，月浦楊行外圍夜戰較昨夜更為激烈。</p>
<h3>軍事觀察家稱　國軍在滬佈設　無數袋形陣地　將與凡爾登史太林格勒媲美</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕某軍事觀察家頃稱：國軍在上海附近佈成無數之袋形陣地，每一袋形陣地週圍，均置有足够之機動部隊，包括步·砲·戰·輜兵種在內，並有週密之計劃，對匪軍之棲形攻擊，現滲透戰術，均能發揮極大效力，以十三日戰果論一日之間，匪軍傷亡至六七千人，此尙為一個小袋形之戰鬥，倘戰局全面展開，若每日有五個袋形陳地進行戰鬥，則匪軍可能每日損失三萬人，陳毅全力不過廿個縱隊，上海或可成為一次大戰中之凡爾登，二次大戰中之史太林格勒，惟陳毅今後對淞滬之戰略決策如何，硬攻抑圍困，殊堪玩味。</p>

<h3>戰時遠東英司令官　談防禦香港問題　需有美國與英共和聯邦各國援助</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕戰時遠東方面英軍司令官十三日聲稱，有效的防禦香港，需要美國與英共和聯邦各國之援助。苟無在短距離內控制基地之充分海空軍予以合作，則香港駐軍無論如何强大，均不能扼守該地。戰前英遠東艦隊實力極充沛，且有友好之中國，估計英軍獨力防守香港，尙僅能支持九十天，如今估計能支持之日期，必須减少，除非英駐軍確可得到美國以及太平洋其他友善强國以供給海空軍基地，予以支援。</p>
<p>據英方前遠東海軍司令官稱，一九三五年時，英方與美海軍有一「君子協定」，當時遠東英艦隊實力减少，因有一部份調往地中海應付因墨索里尼侵略阿比西尼亞而引起之威脅。</p>
<p>空軍司令官謂保衛香港，空軍極關重要，惟空軍基地頗費籌思，蓋最近而終不致落入中共掌握之空軍基地，乃在菲律濱羣島，香港一旦遭遇全力攻擊，則英國防禦該地之意嚮，僅能在有計劃的區域防衛辦法上實行之，此區城防衛辦法，必須包括美國領士，實際等於太平洋防禦公約。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　國際戰爭中的俘虜問題</h3>
<p>— 嵇鶴琴</p>
<p>近年來兵連禍結，第二次大戰的血跡未乾，而新的國際戰爭又在醞釀之中了；最驚心動魄的原子武器，現為各國所共知，已不足為奇，而新的殺人武器又將層出不窮，人類文化似乎在開倒車，武器日新月異，戰略也天天在進步之中；但對於戰爭的人道主義，不但沒有進步，反而退化到二千年以前。別的不必說，即以戰爭俘虜一項問題而論，也就可見一斑了。</p>
<p>書經云：「殲厥渠魁，脅從罔治」。是說戰爭只要殲其首領，不必去懲辦其從者。左傳云：「君子不重傷」，是說敵人已經受傷，失去作戰能力，就不必再去傷害他。司馬穗苴云：「敵若傷之，醫藥歸之」，是說敵人受傷被俘，以醫藥治愈其傷而送回，可見中國歷史文化基礎，是築在人道主義上的。</p>
<p>在八十五年前，瑞士人發明了紅十字會，為中立機關，於一八六四年八月二十二日，關於戰地軍人待遇，訂立日內瓦公約，先後參加者共有五十五國，中國由日本介紹入會，於一九〇四年六月廿九日正式加入。其條約第五條云：「凡國中人士至前綫救護傷兵，均有自由受人尊敬之權，凡交戰國之將士，對於有關人道之救濟，以及救濟傷兵者中立權利，均負有通知人民之責，凡有人在其屋內收容及看護傷兵，其屋即應受保護，軍隊不得佔據。此外，如遇征收戰事捐稅，亦得免除其一部份。」第六條云：「凡傷病兵士，不論國籍，均當收納醫治，在可能範圍內，並得有兩方同意時，在戰爭期內，軍事長官有權將敵方受傷軍人立即交還敵方前綫，凡受傷軍人醫愈後，認為無力作戰者，亦得送還其本國。凡送還之軍人，以及送還之管理人員，均得享受絕對中立之權利。」一八九九年七月廿九日，訂立的海牙公約，對於海上醫院及救護船等，大意亦與陸她救護同。　　根據上列之條例察視，今日之俘虜，未能享受此條約之福利者甚多，雖為各俘虜之不幸，亦為軍事長官及負有救護傷病兵之公私機關，未能盡到責任之故。</p>
<p>一九〇六年七月六日，日內瓦公約，改良戰塲上受傷及患病兵士之待遇。第一條，凡軍人及正式隨軍人員，遇受傷或患病時，不論國籍，應由當管理該項人員之交戰團為之醫治，目須尊敬之。如交戰國至不得已時，而將受傷及患病人員遺棄於敵方，但亦當審察當時軍事情形，儘量留下一部份軍醫人員及醫藥用品以便醫治。第二條，如該項人員，一旦落於敵人之手而為俘虜時，當採用關於對待俘虜之人道原則。對於受傷或患病之俘虜，各交戰國均得自由訂立合於下列各點：（一）於每次交戰後，應將遺棄於戰塲上之受傷人員互相送回。（二）凡受傷或患病人員，至醫愈後，或至病體稍僡可以移送時，而為交戰團所不願再為俘虜者，得各送回其本國。（三）如取得一中立國之同意，可將敵方之受傷或患病人員送交該中立國，由中立國担任看守之責，至戰爭終結為止。第三條，於每次交戰後，得勝之交戰團應即設法從事於搜集及保護受傷或戰死之兵士，使不致有被搶劫及虐待之情事發生，對於死者之掩埋或火葬前之屍體檢查，務必審愼，應由戰勝者注意之。</p>
<p>一九〇七年十月十八日海牙公約，對於俘虜優待則進步愈多，如第四條云：戰事俘虜，乃屬於敵方政府權力之下，並不屬於俘得人或俘得團體權力之下，待遇俘虜，應根據人道主義，除軍械·馬匹及軍事文件外，其餘屬於私人所有之物，仍歸俘虜所有。第五條，不論城市·堡壘·軍營·或在其他住所，均可作為看守俘虜之用，且被俘者不得離開指定之區域，至於監禁，則只許於不得已時為維持治安起見而行。第六條，除俘虜中之軍官外，國家對於俘虜，得按其等級及技能，使之工作，但工作不得過度，且以與戰事無關者為限，俘虜得為公共機關，或為私人，或為俘虜自身工作，俘虜工作，須給予與本國軍人工作同等之工價，如無軍人工價之規定，則估計其工作給以相當之代價，如為其他公共機關或為私人工作，則對於工作之代價，須與軍事當局商定條件，除扣去生活費外，俘虜所得之工資，足以改善其現狀，如再有餘剩，應於釋放時結算付淸。</p>
<p>時隔廿年，到了一九二九年七月二十七日，世界各國又在日內瓦締結條約，改良傷兵的待遇，並在緒言中聲明：「各簽約國承認凡於戰事劇烈之際，當盡其能力所及，减少俘虜無可避免之痛苦改善其待遇，而發展肇始海牙和平會議之原則，尤注重於該會議附載之軍事法律及軍事習慣規程」。至其要點，有下列五項：</p>
<p>（一）傷病兵在任何環境中，要受尊敬及保護，受人道之待遇，不分國籍，得本隊權力之維護，若干軍隊因高不得已放棄其傷兵病卒於敵人時，當在軍事需要可能之下，存留一部份軍醫處人員及其物品，以補助彼輩之看護。</p>
<p>（二）除上條所列對於傷兵病卒之保護保留外，凡一國軍隊之傷兵病卒，淪入敵國軍隊勢力時，即成為俘虜，得享受對於普通罪犯規定之公機，惟軍隊認為要時，得以優待傷兵病卒起見，另訂優於現行法規之條例。</p>
<p>（三）每次戰事後，戰區佔有者當設法搜尋傷兵死卒，以保護之，免使其受搶刧或虐待，凡於戰事環境許可之下，二國軍隊當定局部之休戰或停止戰火，俾便搜尋陷於二陣綫中之傷兵。</p>
<p>（四）戰地軍隊，當於最短期間內，互相通知本軍隊，收集或發現之對方傷兵病卒及傷亡者之姓名，及可以作證之記錄，戰地軍隊當立軍士死亡表，而互相寄交之，其著者若軍人之證章，以一半寄交其本國軍隊，而其餘一半則　於死者之身，戰地軍隊當注意於掩埋或火化死者之前，加以愼密之檢查，或於可能時，使以藥物試騐，以探死者眞相，此外尤須注意死者埋葬之榮譽，其墳墓之尊敬，予以適當之符誌，俾便將來認領。戰地軍隊為履行本條起見，於戰事發動之始，即當正式組織墳墓建設處，俾日後雖埋葬數目之衆，而仍得隨時掘取屍首，而於死者姓氏不致發生錯誤，戰事終止後，二國軍隊當立即交換墳墓表，及葬於公墓或別處之死者姓名表。</p>
<p>（五）軍隊長官得徵求當地熱心人士，收容及看護軍隊中傷兵病卒，惟須受該長官之檢查，而對於應征者當予以特殊保護與相當便利。</p>
<p>以上所述，雖對國際戰爭而言，但慘絕人寰　內戰，自亦一體適用。第二次大戰後，若干國家相繼發生內戰，對於戰俘的待遇問題，均未能加以重視，站在人道主義的立塲，內戰雙方應遵守國際公約辦理。</p>
<h3>北平和平眞像　穗中央日報刊載吳延懷撰文</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十四日電〕此間由央日報自七日起，連續刋載吳延懷所撰「北平和平眞象」一文，對共黨盛稱之「和平模範」的北平淪陷經過，以目擊者的身份，平心靜氣的態度，叙述至為翔實，茲自今日起，將全文陸續播發如下：</p>
<p>（一）前面的話</p>
<p>北平自被關於鐵幕裏以後，逃難在外的北方同鄉，因為還撇下多多少少親親友友，都渴望得一點家鄉消息，關心和平的全國同胞，因為北平被共黨指作和平模範，也都願聽些那邊的情形，前此報紙上雖常有些零碎的報道，但都片片段段，仍難滿一般人的慾望，筆者於一月八日為探父病飛平，三月十九日化裝小販，繞內蒙綏包逃出，日前輾轉來穗，在北平圍城及解放下，各過了好些時光，因為河北平津各界領袖都為多年老友，當地居民又多親戚故舊，故對圍城情形，和平醞釀，易守狀況，種種內情知之較詳，到穗後，關心北平的朋友們，紛紛以此見詢，見一位說一遍，見兩位道兩遭，一拉開話匣子，就得兩三點鐘，於此長途跋涉之餘，每天應酬這麼三四次，實在有些吃不消，為偷懶計，爰寫「北平和平眞象」，作一「綜合報道」。</p>
<p>（二）圍城之前</p>
<p>傅作義先生自抗戰後，卽坐鎭察綏，提倡國家自由，政治民主，經濟平等，並身體力行，布衣粗食，與士卒生活一致，且虛懷若谷，常開工作檢討會，隨時使用新方法，故十餘年來，戰無不克，中央始終倚為北方長城。卅六年底，東北軍事失利，河北石莊淪陷，統帥部從新佈署，成立華北剿總，從此五省兩市全交傳手，地大兵稀，當時很多友好都為他揑了一把汗，但傅先生自信力極强，聲言東北設能固守一年，到卅八年底，他就可負責担保華北無虞。由此之後，他兢兢業業，兩開軍政討論會，實行游剿控制面，石友三的騎兵，且曾游剿到已作十餘年共黨兵站基地的河間，而大獲全勝，又曾組援晋兵團，直搗石家莊，將帥意志之强，士卒氣勢之旺，眞是一時無兩。可惜的是在他準備未完，於去年十一月後，錦州撤退，長瀋易手，整個東北均變顏色，傳先生麾下只有四十餘萬衆，對付聶榮臻一部尙感不足，此後林彪復率數十萬之衆，乘勝南下，華北命運可想而知。聽說當時總帥部的腹案有：（一）撤退華北，將全部力量調至蘇北，參加徐蚌會戰，此戰勝後再沿津浦綫北上，徐圖發展。（二）將華北剿總遷至塘沽，撤退保定。張家口等地兵力，令李文率十三軍·十六軍·孤守北平，其餘軍隊均集中在天津·塘沽·唐山等沿海地帶，此後中央接濟及美援，可由海面源源而來，進攻退守運用自如。聽說傅先生當時是採取的第二個方案，先由保定主剿撤離，因他的子弟兵均在張家口，故曾親去二次，商量撤退計劃，但因當地參議會及民衆團體流淚挽留，開了兩天會，都沒有忍作最後決定，就在這猶疑不定的時光，林彪部共軍很快的就由間道衡到南口，切斷了撤離之路，他不得已只好於十二月十三日趕快下令，將各地部隊都集中在平津張塘，以免再零碎被吃，由此十四日圍城開始。</p>
<p>（三）孤軍苦守</p>
<p>十二月十四日後，整個華北剿總傅所轄的五省二市，除綏遠尙保持半省的局面以外，只餘太原·大同·張家口·塘沽及北平·天律六個孤點了。太原·大同實際由閻先生負責，茲不具論。其餘四個孤點，均歸傅先生直接指揮。據說，最初的如意算盤是：（一）仍令張家口部隊衝闖到平；（二）徐蚌會戰勝利後，中央可由塘沽增援；（八）北平部隊，除留十三·十六兩軍外，其餘乘勢衝到津沽，收復沿海地帶，仍完成原定部署。故圍城之初，傅先生仍不氣餒，下面士氣仍旺，但以後一連串的事實，把一切都給否定了。最初是三十五軍。暫三軍在張家口南新保安的全部殉職，郭軍長撅之。安軍長春山僅以身免。這一戰確太壯烈了，據說林彪部因該兩軍屢經招降不聽，氣極了，用剛由東北得來的大砲，連續向城內轟了好幾萬發，城內房舍無一倖存，城牆也被打了多少缺口，攻陷時，在城內只俘擄了幾百個活人。由此之後，傳先生的基本部隊完了，自信力失了，接着就是徐蚌會戰意外的慘敗，靠山完了，救援絕望了。好多人在想天津四郊遼曠，又無城牆，兩個軍又怎能守得住呢？北平擁有二百多萬市民，卅幾萬軍隊，每天至少須消耗三百多萬斤食糧，卽令中央能每天來五百架飛機空投，每機載重兩噸，也還無濟於事，更不必說子彈及其他補給了。故卅八年元旦左右，傅先生情緒極壞，常繞室徘徊，悶無一語，甚至自打雙頰，聲震戶外，內心之苦，由此可知。但此種情形，外面知者甚鮮，故北平社會秩序甚佳，士氣也不低落，因他是守城名將，大家對他都有信心。我是一月八日因探父病飛塘的，坐的是由上海去的自斷航後第一架客機，那正是圍城後的第廿四天，使用的是新條將好的天坦飛機塲，出機塲後，見天橋還是熙熙攘攘，盛況如前，走到東單牌樓，見一片民伕，正忙着修東單機塲，市面上雖說米·麵·猪肉·靑菜飛漲，但市塲上的貨並不太缺，影院戲園只是晚上因了戒嚴的關係，少演一塲，北平全市除街上多了些軍隊外，一切不感到異樣，只是城門緊閉，每個衡要的路口都堆起沙包來了，每天拂曉或傍晚，常發生一小陣或一大陣緊密的槍砲聲，阜城門內及南北池子一帶，當飛來幾個不大不少的砲彈，前後共炸死過十幾個居民。至於共軍在城外的動態，則無由得知。（未完待續）</p>

<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十三日電〕柏林封鎖解除未生枝節，此間各國駐使多認為未來四國外長會議有成功之可能。某某國大使每日有電報吿本國政府卽作如是觀，惟不願作過份預測耳。此間各國使館間咸以未來四國外長會議為唯一談話資料，僅少數以為此種會議仍不免破裂。</p>

<p>〔聯合社柏林十四日電〕美英法三國軍事總督今日已批六合西柏林之自治法規，其中規定德人得直接管理柏林西區之行政，但三司令仍保有廣大之監督權，尤其保有解除武裝·賠償·對外關係，管理德國戰爭犯等權力。佔領軍並有權發表緊急命令，確保西柏林治安及金融經濟之安危。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林十三日電〕英發言人今晚聲稱，四強曾於今日在柏林舉行許多月來第一次的談話，但渠拒不透露會談之詳細情形。此一四強會談之消息，係西柏林市政府經濟部長克林格爾霍夫所首先傳出，渠在記者招待會上稱，西方國家代表今日與蘇代表會晤，以討論恢復柏林與西方間貿易恢復的問題，預定將于明日繼續舉行一次會議。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕坎特培里「赤一色」主教瓊森，今日在此間發表演說稱，蘇聯決不願戰爭，數日來的事件堪為其明證。去歲東遊美國時，發見美國一般人民亦均不願戰爭，彼等祇願和平及諒解。渠又曰，馬歇爾方案自相矛盾之處極多，我們寧可束緊褲帶，不可接受此種金錢。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕工黨議會密里亞克斯今日在此間英國捷克友誼同盟之會議中發表演說，表示在工黨秉政期間，決不致發生戰爭，因為工黨政府及下議院中的多數黨，決不願英國參戰。渠認大西洋公約為不必要，多此一舉且具有危險性。</p>

<h3>日政府將要求遠委會　全面取消日賠償　美國決定僅停止初步賠償計劃</h3>

<p>渠稱：美國最近中止賠償給付的決定，不過係屬於初步賠償百分之三十的計劃者，渠認為遠東委員會有權決定進一步賠償給付問題。渠透露：日本政府有意使劃作賠償的全部工廠完全開工。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十四日電〕日本政府官員十四日希望美國採取行動，取消進一步的日本賠償，如遠東委員會宣佈者，渠並希望此舉卽為日本全部賠償終止之謂。政府發言人對國會委員會稱：百分之三十初步賠償計劃中的卸除計劃，已遵照麥帥命令完成三分之一，此等工廠均係以前的兵工廠。渠稱：如停止進一步賠償的計劃實現，則本年度預算中的二十六億日圓賠償費用，可能稱作他用。日共發言人志賀則警吿稱：政府在目前應採取觀望政策，因停止進一步賠償的計劃，必須經遠東委員會通過。</p>
<h3>賠償決定權　應由遠委會負責</h3>
<p>我駐日代表吳半農意見</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十四日電〕美政府下令停止日本賠償計劃，中國駐日代表團經濟組長吳半農今日向聯合社發表聲明稱，由本代表團觀之，美國祇應廢止關於提前移交方案之指令，不應取消其全部賠償計劃。此整個賠償方案，係由日本所負戰爭義務而來，盟國對於戰爭損失及所受摧殘，皆有其合理要求。關於賠償之最後決定權應賦予全體盟國列席之遠東委員會。且根據波茨坦宣言，及日本投降後之基本政策，日本賠償問題之一個主要目的，卽為消滅其戰爭潛力，使之不再能對隣邦發動侵略戰，以危害世界和平。提前移交方案，僅及日本政府兵工廠之百分之三十，其全部飛機廠及私人軍火廠，俱絲亳未動，至於輔助戰爭之無數工業，更不必論。此等工業對於日本經濟生活均不能有所供獻，因為日本今日尚未能完全利用其和平工業設備。最後本代表團於美國目前對賠償問題之政策是否賢明，亦不能無疑，惟茲過於重大，當留待後世史家評判。</p>
<h3>對美國措施　菲將提強硬抗議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬尼剌十四日電〕菲律賓外次納利十四日稱：美國停止日本賠償給付的政策，「對吾人實為一種嚴重打擊」，政府卽將擬就強硬抗議，由聯合國菲律賓常任代表兼遠東委員會代表羅慕洛提出。納利稱：「吾人僅能乞援於　茨坥協定，該協定明白規定佔領日本國家的義務，美國的宣佈完全出乎吾人意外。納利并稱：渠將以無綫電與羅慕洛聯絡，討論此一問題。」</p>
<h3>日工廠六百餘家　勢將被保留</h3>
<p>東京股票市塲價格激漲</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十四日電〕由於美國決定不再自日本提取進一步的賠償，業被劃入賠償中的六百八十五家私人工廠及造船所將被保留，此舉勢將加速日本的工業及經濟復興。此等被指定為賠償的工廠，雖非完全開工，但其中開工的四百七十家在復興日本戰後經濟中，佔有極重要的地位。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十四日電〕緊接着美國宣佈不再自日本提取進一步賠償的新政策以後，此間股票市塲中的股票價格一飛衝天，若干鋼鐵股票上漲百分之五十，電力股票上漲百分之二十至三十，輪船公司股票上海百分之三十五</p>

<p>〔聯合社仰光十四日電〕緬甸外長馬益今日稱，不列顚聯邦已允在財政與軍事上援助緬甸政府戡亂，緬人可以不必憂慮。吾人已獲得充分軍事需要，僅缺乏人手而已。當前任務在訓練兵士使用武器。此種配備須防止落於叛軍之手，此為至要。恢復治安應為第一目標，治安不恢復，經濟復興無從開始。</p>

<h3>一九二九年之不景氣　不致重見於今日　美國經濟學家發表意見</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十二日電〕五月十日，勒萊新聞觀察報以「我們已否得到充分教訓？」為題，發表社評稱：著名經濟學家蘇爾在星期日的紐約時報雜誌上發表了一篇文章，其中對於「我們對於一九二九年的情形已否得到充份的教訓？」這個問題，提出了一個有力的正面答案。</p>
<p>蘇爾先生列舉了引起一九二九開始的不景氣而為衆所公認的原因，並且提出了足以令人信服的證據說明種種防範措置業已樹立，後者至少可以使我們避免猶如十年前所發生的那種嚴重的不景氣。但是，吾國從一九二九年的經騐中獲得教訓固然是亳無問題的，可是問題乃在於我們已否獲得充分的教訓，而可以躱閃一個較溫和的不景氣。關於這個問題，蘇爾先生的答案比較沒有那樣可以令人信服，惟有時間可以提供一個完全的答覆。可是列舉上次不景氣的種種公認的原因，就足以表示關於過去若干錯誤目前並未重踏覆轍。蘇爾先生列舉這些原因如下：股票市塲的暴跌；輕易放款以致建築過多的摩天樓和商業建築物，興建房屋熱的低落（這種興建房屋熱係於一九二六年達最高峯）；因分期付款辦法盛行而對汽車業市塲所發生的過份刺激，虛偽的有利貿易平衡，後者是　不可靠的國外投資維持的；技術上的特殊改進有利於大企業者多而對於消費者則屬不夠，以及（最後但是決非最不重要的）農民的痛苦，因為他們在初期不景氣中所受的打擊遠過於工業方面所受的打擊，以致他們後來沒有力量去應付繼之而來的不景氣。目今公司方同所獲得的巨大利益無過於在第一次世界大戰後所獲得的利益（直到幾年之前才證明第一次世界大戰後所獲得的利益乃是虛構的）。但是除了這一個例外之外，對於蘇爾先生所列舉的自從一九二九年以來的種種情形，都已有極大的改進。在銀行放款的運用方面，我們也許已犯了過與不及的毛病。許多銀行，並不濫予放款，而似乎忘記了放款是一家銀行的主要任務。但當然不致會發生銀行業務近於失敗的情形，這種失敗會加深和延長上次的不景氣。股票市塲也有崩潰的危險，理由很簡單，因為一般的人已退出市塲，而投機者不得不把他們自己的錢來做交易。私人對海外的投資，並沒有大規模的冒險，而對於汽車和其他類似的東西，也沒有過分的建造和人為的刺激市塲。最後，農民的情形較之一九二九年好得多。在一九四〇年和一九四九年之間，他們的押款債務已由六十六億美元减少到四十九億元，他們手頭的現款和銀行裏的存款，已從三十九億美元增至一百五十六億元，此外，他們已購了價値四十七億美元的政府公債。這一切加起來，拼成一幅令人欣慰的圖畫。但在這幅圖畫之上，必須加上一個不容爭辯的事實：那就是最近令人歡迎的物價下跌已產生了令人不歡迎的失業增多。原因是什麼呢？和一九二九年比較之下，可以看出：物價依然很高，並且有不少工業仍在獲取不合理的巨大利潤但是總而言之，只要人民有現款保存而不輕率舉債，那末一九二九年的不景氣情形　　，並沒有很大的重演機會。</p>
<p>史奈德否認美商業將衰落</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十三日電〕美財長史奈德稱，目前美國之經濟異常堅強，雖然若干人預測美國之商業將見衰退。星期四，史奈德向來自全國各地之銀行家發表談話，聲稱在目前情形下有四項有力因素可使吾人在「高收入與高就業水準」之上維持穩定。渠列舉此等因素如下：並無投機——「在戰後繁榮之幾年中，實際上幾無投機活動。在吾國商業史上，每一次之衰退，總先見於投機賬目之巨額了結，目前此一特點之並不存在，以余視之乃與以前衰落時期最不相同之處」。戰後工業之逐漸調整——「過去商業上之衰退，大部份為未能預先估及者，而衰退之所以成為嚴重，乃由於經濟之許多方面同時調整之故。惟目前之情形則屬不同。為使經濟更眞有正常之競爭性質而進行之調整，實際上自戰爭一吿結束以來卽在進行之中」。高收入水準與儲蓄之積聚——異常値得注意之一點，卽為消費者之採購正藉收入繼續支持高水準以及儲蓄達到空前記錄而加以維持。本年三月份個人之收入——目前所知之最近數字——按年計之為二一四·〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，此一數字雖較去年十二月之歷來最高峯稍低，惟猶高於一年前之水準。個人之流動資產——卽積聚之購買力之另一名稱——目前達二千億美元」。技術發現與發明——「吾人僅在從事和平時代發展之初。吾人方才開始利用戰時所發現之新物資，新製造技術與新式配備以製造新製品。僅就戰時之原子能發展言之，卽能在較少之幾年中使吾國之經濟生活革命化」。</p>

<p>休息過後，雙方再戰，中航原陣不動，志超吳祺祥開上前綫，親掛帥印，果然威力倍增，關承常邊陲起義，另向中央，吳祺祥迎頭一頂，破網而入，扳回一城。中航全師退守，努力防禦，雙方各無建樹，於四十一分鐘，志超環攻不已，吳哲民派司關承常，斜射入網，相差一球，奈時間局促，志超諸將雖然努力，但已不及，最後反為高秀淸廿碼處射入一球，結果中航以西比二取勝志超。</p>

<h3>棉紗交易沉寂　布市續趨下游　國行昨收購棉紗</h3>
<p>棉紗交易沉寂，各檔均係喊價居多。緣日來廠方資金，多吿無法應付當前困難，脫意極濃，惟因圈外金融性物品價格續收，市勢先低後平，四十二支藍鳳午收一〇二〇〇〇萬，續升九千餘萬。卅二支銀月七六〇〇〇萬，升一億元。廿一支雙馬棧單未見作開，喊價亦無，現貨做六六〇〇〇萬，升六〇〇〇萬。廿支以下一致俏升。</p>

<h3>工廠申請臨時工貸　應准予一律參加　市商會具呈社會局籲請</h3>
<p>市商會昨具呈社會局，籲請對工廠貸款，不論申請之廠家，為工業同業公會會員，或商業同業公會會員，應准許其一律參加，俾昭公允，而免紛擾，略云：「查本市工業界以本月半發薪困難，商請國行舉辦臨時貸款，經決定分別以收購成品曁直接貸放兩種方式辦理，並擬訂臨時工貸辦法七條，進行貸放，惟查國行此次臨時工貸，仍以工業公會所屬工廠為限，殊欠公允。此次舉辦之目的，在於解救各廠商迫於眉急之月半發薪困難，但本市從事民生日用品之生產事業，決非僅工業公會所屬工廠，商業同業公會會員中，亦有甚多符合貸款資格之工廠，其因外銷斷絕，市銷淸淡，陷於無力支發職工薪資之困境，絕無二致，決不能使同屬生產廠商，及以勞力服務之工人，遭受歧遇。按吾國昔無工廠之名稱，凡工人工作之塲所，無論其規模大小，統稱之為作塲，嗣後生產發達，始有工廠之名稱，然其無論屬於商業工業機構，同為擁有大量工人，從事生產之工廠，則事同一轍，故凡政府所辦解救廠商困厄維護工人生計之措施，自應一視同仁，無分畛域。然過去如國行貼放會舉辦小型工貸，及最近國行發配工廠領兌銀元以發薪等往事，以及日前頒之本市職工薪資計算暫行辦法中，關於特種配米一層，亦係專指各工業公會所屬會員廠商發給職工而言，仍使商業機構中之塲廠，獨抱向隅，不僅有失公平合理之原則，且常引致勞資間無謂之糾紛，明事理之工人，徒嘆政府處事之未盡公允，不明事理之工人，且以為同屬工人，決不致故分畛域，將謂廠方之急於爭取，或竟疑故弄玄虛，從中取巧，以是勞資紛擾，迭起無已，困苦之情，罄竹難書，由此瀝陳實情，仰祈迅予轉請中央銀行，對於此次臨時工貸，凡屬工廠，不論其加入工業同業公會，或商業同業公會，應准許其一律參加，以昭公允，而裱紛擾。」</p>
<h3>隔日存款搭發銀元　撥款委會通過辦法</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕關於各行局庫及商業行莊隔日存款餘額應付辦法，昨經國行撥款委員會會議通過如下：</p>
<p>「查本行最近鈔劵供應雖較寬裕，但仍不敷實際需要，故對於各行局庫及商業行莊隔日存款餘額，除儘量供應現鈔外，仍須搭發定額本票及銀幣，而各行局庫及商業行莊應付存款，除以現鈔及定額本票支付外，對於所領得之銀幣，因其存款總額較存放本行之款為鉅，未能比照本行所發銀幣成數付給存戶，外界不明眞相，不免有所誤會。茲為兼顧事實，規定辦法起見，擬自卽日起，應由各行局庫及商業行莊於每日營業終了時，隨將存款總額及其庫存銀幣數額列報本行備查，次日支付存款，卽以前一日庫存銀幣連同當日可向本行領取之銀幣數與存款總額之比例，作為搭發銀幣之成份，不滿銀幣一元者照給金圓劵，並在營業櫃外公開揭示，俾衆週知」。</p>
<h3>各方傾力吸收　金價一路上升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲，因局日益緊張，各方傾力吸收，開時盤不到片刻，卽吿衝出三十億大關，由二九億五，一路升達三二億。一度交易混亂，有求無供，最高曾迫近三三億六之漲停邊上。央行聞訊，繼續拋售，委託大德成以三二億之價格，無限制供賣，金號封吊吸胃奇佳，共出二百十九大條之多。人心堅定，終以三二億收盤，較上日又跳三億五。</p>
<p>塲外開盤二九億，三一億，低至二八億，三〇億，高至三二億，三四億，午收三一億，三三億。午後交易冷落，人心看漲，又高至三二億，三四億收盤，亦加起四億五千萬。</p>

<h3>銀元市况堅昂　地下交易旺盛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元市勢仍堅，一般商號，均已停止買賣，掛牌亦多脫去，馬路黃牛，又趨活躍，地下交易旺盛。</p>
<p>金銀交換行市，昨日再度放長二元，市况稍有參差，對搭初做四八，五一，繼升至四九，五二，通貨均做五〇進，五五出。</p>
<p>金鈔交換，市勢平定。一般交易，不如金銀之旺盛，仍做五十二進，五十四出。鈔銀交換，上落亦多，低者做九元，九元五，高者做九元五，十元。</p>
<p>昨日美鈔塲外因各幫去化活躍，買氣旺盛，脫銀進鈔者，頗不乏人，市勢一路領先。晨開五五〇萬，六〇〇萬，低至五三〇萬，五八〇萬，高至六〇〇萬，六五〇萬，午收稍降至五八〇萬，六三〇萬，午後人心堅挺，又高至六〇〇萬，六五〇萬，已穿出六關，較上日再漲七〇萬。</p>

<h3>農業增產源泉經濟繁榮動力　台灣合作金庫</h3>
<p>— 辛士</p>
<p>〔台北訊〕本省的合作事業，在日治時代已有相當基礎，不過它只是作為帝國主義經濟的搜刮和統治的工具，緩和資本獨佔的手段，與我國民生主義經濟的平等原則逈異其趣。光復後，省政當局，便設立合作機構，進行全面改組，二年餘以來，經過不斷的努力，順利發展，基礎亦逐漸鞏固，現有合作社計五百二十七社，社員七十二萬人，遍佈於全省各地，業務上則側重於扶住漁業農業的生產，使本省特產品的銷路原料的供給都能夠平衡的發展。有這成就，固由於省政當局合作事業繁榮本省社會最主要的關鍵。</p>
<p>改組經過</p>
<p>光復以前的合作金融機關，名為臺灣產業組合聯合會，於民國三十一年間成立，至三十二年改稱為臺灣產業金庫，辦理存放款及匯兌等業務。光復後暫維原狀。至三十五年十月間，始成立現在的合作金庫，資本額定為臺幣二千五百萬元，除由省署及有關機關認股一千五百萬元外，以繁榮本省人民經濟生活為目的，以調劑本省合作事業資金為任務，絕非純粹着眼於營利，所以能實踐共有共營共享的原則，而擴大投資之範圍，供給合作事業上必需的資金，以增進合作社員之社會經濟生活，而且爲了本質上是比較穩妥與安全的，所以除了調劑資金促進合作事業的發展外，還能收到協助政府安定本省社會金融的效用。</p>
<p>組織輪廓</p>
<p>該金庫的內部組織，相當龐大，決策機構為理事會，負責執行股東大會的決議案，決定營業方針，審定各項規章等，另設監事會，負責監查該金庫財產狀況，及執行業務狀況等，理事會設理事十一人，內公股理事七人，社股理事四人，監事會設監事五人，內公股監事三人，社股監事二人，總金庫內設總經理一人，下設協理二人，及總務，會計，出納，稽核，研究等五室，和業務，信託等二部，並為適應社會要求起見，在各重要地區，已設立分支庫機構，計有臺北，新竹，臺南，臺中，高雄，東部等六處，及代理處全省五十五單位，去年二月間為辦理業務迅速計，將臺北支庫撤銷，其業務由總庫業務部直接辦理，又為繁榮臺東的農村經濟起見，將東部支庫改方見花蓮支庫，專辦花蓮業務，臺東則另設立臺東支庫一所，最近更在嘉義，彰化，宣蘭等地籌支庫，預計不久卽可開業。</p>
<p>目前業務</p>
<p>該金庫自正式成立以來，經總經理苦心擘劃，及一般工作人員共同努力的結果，業務蒸蒸日上，主要的業務，大略可以分為存款，放款，匯兌，代理公庫，經銷全省印花稅票，代辦戶口糖配給等六個部份，茲分述如下：（一）存款：該金庫吸收的存款，大部為農村的資金，過去因為農村需用資金，加以信用上作社管理辦法尚未公佈，致各合作事業團體的存款數目，未能達到理想的地步，但經該庫努力勸導，存款總數亦逐月　增，年來增加更速。</p>
<p>（二）放款：該金庫貸放的對象，以合作事業團體為主體，並為配合政府平抑物價政策起見，放款多偏重於農村生產，及漁業生產方面，凡借款人信用昭著，期間適合，而且用途正常，一經審查合格，卽可貸放，手續甚為簡便，利息至低，年來申請者甚為踴躍。</p>
<p>（三）匯兌業務：該金庫在全省各地均普設有代理處，為便利金融流通起見，經於前年一月起，開辦匯兌及代收款等業務，手續簡便，收費低廉，而且不限於合作團體，卽個人亦可託匯託收，自開辦以來，因為社會信用昭著，及匯兌手續迅速，省民均稱便利，故匯兌業務至形發達。</p>
<p>（四）代理公庫：本省公庫統由臺灣銀行主辦，但臺銀行為設分支機構的所在，均委託由該金庫代理，負責收解各機關所需經費，及各種收入，現在代理公庫的所在，計有桃園等九十三單位。</p>
<p>（五）經銷全省印花稅票：該金庫受省府財政廳委託，代售全省印花稅票，經指定各出資合作社為分銷處，並另在衝要地區設立零售處，現在代銷處共達四百餘所，遍佈全省窮鄉僻地，裨益國庫收入，至為鉅大。</p>
<p>（六）代辦戶口糖配給：該庫於三十六年七月間，奉省政府令辦理全省戶口糖配給事宜，每二個月為一期，每期每人可領到半公斤，每期受配人口達六百五十餘萬人，售價比市價低廉，且配給週密，省民受惠不尠。</p>
<p>此外，代理業務方面，已辦者尚有善後救濟總　肥料款，由該庫代收　轉臺灣銀行，以及烟葉公司收購烟葉款項，由該庫臺中·花蓮兩支庫代付等，兼辦信託事業。</p>
<p>今後計劃</p>
<p>爲了檢討過去，策劃將來，對於今後業務方針，該金庫并擬作如下的改進：（一）增設支庫並加強代理處業務：本省幅員遼闊，欲求深入民間，普遍服務，尚感力不從心，因此特　在重要地區增設支庫若干所，並將委託兼辦性質的代理處，於增設支庫後，調整分配隸屬監督，以利推進業務。（二）儘量吸收存款並簡化手續：本省近來遊資充付，物價跳動不已，該庫為協助政府安定金融計，擬飭各支庫儘量吸收合作事業團體存款，並將此項存款作為農業生產資金的貸放，使遊資導入生產事業，以安定金融。至於貸款手續，亦力求簡易迅速，並視貸款性質，酌量延長貸放時間，籍收增產之效。（三）加強信託業務：本省合作社員總數計七十餘萬人，為避免商人的中間剝削起見，關於社員日常必需用品的採購供應，各社員產品的代運推銷等工作，今後當與各聯合社協同步調，勉力服務，籍以減輕社員負担，並安定一般物價。</p>
<p>這是本省農業生產的泉源，同時是安定經濟繁榮地方的動脈。</p>

<p>受狄托的歧視　甚至由於狄托而遭遇阻力，正當蘇聯順利的進行對奧和約談判的時候，狄托就提出南斯拉夫對於加里西亞的要求，使得整個問題趨於紊亂，而不易得着一致的結論。關於要求整個問題特港歸還南國問題，因為史達林的野心，也企圖插足其間，會呌他大感困惱，要他在四強面前丟臉。後來狄托游說保加利亞和希臘，這些都顯示出狄托在步調和時間各方面，他都不大理會莫斯科的訓令，而直接自動行事。狄托的巴爾干計劃，是要以南斯拉夫為中心的聯合巴爾幹各國，成立巴爾幹同盟。這種作法的動機，主要的是為着戒備蘇聯對於南國的侵擾。但是這和史達林企圖囊括整個巴爾幹，加盟蘇維埃聯邦，作為蘇聯共和國之一的最終目的，顯然又是背道而馳。</p>
<p>史達林在巴爾幹的計劃，第一步是要南斯拉夫和保加利亞團結起來，結合成為一個</p>
<p>南方斯拉夫族　大同盟，而聽命於莫斯科的領導。然後次一步的行動，史達林無可隱秘的是要實施控制狄托的政策，同時還要強化黨的組織和黨的力量，保加利亞國務總理喬治，狄美托夫表示，他將單獨行動，接受史達林委員長的計劃，如果那是勉強可行的話。但狄托　然拒絕，這一個不愉快的表示，使整個形勢驟然的僵化起來，而史達林和狄托之間，也就發生公開的摩擦。</p>
<p>狄托自有他獨立的思想和意識。他這樣認為，除在蘇聯本國之外，史達林的話不見得就是法律，這樣，其他的衛星國家自然可以採取獨立性行動，這種言論在史達林聽來，顯然就是蔑視設侮辱的表示。歐洲其他各國的共產黨員都沒有膽量公然敢講這樣的話，卽使偶然聽見也得趕快悄然離開。</p>
<p>狄托這次賭博性行動的慿籍，是由於他淸楚的看出，史達林的現實情況下，決不會貿然的輕易動手，派出強大的軍力，來顛覆他現有的地位。同時擁護他的羣衆，對他仍有信心，也會益發堅強的抗拒任何外來的較弱攻擊。</p>
<p>史達林的勝利　已被狄托打一個很大的折扣。蘇聯為着警吿其他的附庸國家而採取任何軍事行動的時候，都可能要激起強烈反感。所以還不如摧毀各個附庸國抽象的主題觀念，卽利用經濟復興的手段加以干預，比較來得合適而有把握。這種情形現正遍佈蘇維埃聯邦各個區域，狄托最大的賭本，是南斯拉夫國內的廣大支持力量，曾經大受史達林的恩寵，遠勝於狄托自己的南斯拉夫前參謀總長，當他企圖逃出國境的時候，立刻就被殺害，狄托在國內所能得着的擁護當然不會是百分之百的圓滿狀態，但他準備採取最強硬的手段，對付他的反對黨。</p>
<p>各省共產黨的首領，現在已被淸算。二位意見不同的內閣議員，也請他們走路。在狄托的控制下，有一隊訓練有素的秘密警察，大多數的軍隊，對他都表示忠心。南斯拉夫的人民，自然不會對獨裁政治表示歡迎，但是他們寗願在伯爾格來德有個總攬大權的統治者，而不願這個人物是住在遙遠的莫斯科。</p>
<p>狄托這麼孤注一擲的冒險行動，是曾經深切週密的考慮的，而且這種報復性的機會，也就時常存在，那些</p>
<p>克里姆代理人　可以很成功的給他一個迎頭痛擊，叫他再也爬不起來，南斯拉夫自然也有經濟上的困難，而且很可能形成更大的危險，需要外來的援助，也有人曾作這種的推測，史達林將給南斯拉夫更大的壓力，讓他們掉轉頭來，反對狄托。</p>
<p>事實上，蘇聯的攻勢早已展開，那些來自羅馬尼亞的煤油供應，現在已被截斷。莫斯科的政治工作人員秘密潛入南國，為狄托製造困難。同時，那些有莫斯科直接操縱，來自蘇維埃帝國每個角落的神經戰，現已擺在狄托的面前。但在另一方面，史達林淸算狄托的失敗，也可能會有它本身的價值。</p>
<p>狄托主義獨立思想的蔓延，逗留在史太林的腦海中。</p>
<p>可慮的大問題　保加利亞狄美托夫的傾向令人憤懑，因為他對於莫斯科所表示的忠誠落在理想的後頭，捷克的總理克里蒙特·哥華德看來也不能　使所有的捷克人民，全來　心的擁　史達林。在波蘭共產黨的領袖們也動作遲緩的集合各個田莊的農民，勉強聽從史達林的一切命令，因此，如果輕輕放過狄托而不加　處，那麼克里姆林所能控制的其他附庸國家都可能大受感染而變成一個危機。</p>
<p>同時，由於史達林和狄托間裂罅，而且一時不會有完全縫合的可能，這對於西歐各國將是一個難得的時機。這道裂痕所給西歐各國的一個好時機，他們將利用現成的題材，在商業和宣傳上下番功夫，對付史達林。此外，還可能會有更熱鬧的好戲在後頭。因此史達林為着他本身的利益，必須拿出行動，懲罰南斯拉夫，最近他將不會有多餘的心情，來和其他各國引起太大的衝突，直到他已將這個漏洞完全阻塞好的時候。（譯自世界報吿雜誌）</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Intensifies in Shanghai's Outskirts; All Communist Troops Breaking Through Between Yuepu and Yanghang Annihilated; Songjiang Abandoned, Confrontation at Huangdu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] According to a military dispatch released at 9 PM on the 14th:</p>
<p>(1) Around 1 PM today, approximately one Communist division reinforced from Jiading launched another fierce attack on our Nationalist army positions in the Yuepu and Yanghang area. A certain unit of the defending army took the initiative and bravely counterattacked, inflicting a severe blow. The battle was extremely fierce. In addition to the two Communist guard regiments in the Yuepu area, which were completely annihilated by our forces, more than 3,000 Communists were killed or wounded in the Yanghang area. Corpses piled up like mountains. Our troops' morale is extremely high, with everyone vying to charge forward. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>(2) After our troops' proactive withdrawal from Kunshan, they are currently in a standoff at Huangdu.</p>
<p>(3) West of Yuepu, fierce fighting broke out at 9 AM on the 14th. Under artillery and air cover, our forces fiercely attacked the invading Communists, killing countless numbers and capturing 700 to 800. At 5 PM, the Communists again launched a fierce attack on our Yuepu positions, but were repelled by defending troops with heavy casualties.</p>
<p>(4) A regiment of the 29th Communist Army in Xishengang, west of Yanghang, moved westward with unclear intentions.</p>

<h3>Air Force Continuously Engaged Day and Night; Over 200 Sorties Flown; Significant Results, Nearly 10,000 Communists Killed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Air Force Headquarters reports: Today is the second day of the defense of Shanghai's outskirts. The army, navy, and air force are jointly defending Shanghai with all their might. The air force has been launching sorties around the clock, with over 200 sorties flown in total. The fiercest fighting is still occurring in the Yuepu and Yanghang area northwest of Wusong. Both towns are firmly defended by Nationalist troops to protect the vital Wusong fortress area, which serves as the gateway to and from the great city of Shanghai. From midnight to dawn on the 14th, the Communists launched three offensives in Yuepu and Yanghang, but all were repelled by Nationalist troops. The land artillery and naval warships anchored in the Wusong harbor provided continuous artillery support throughout the night to suppress the Communist offensive, bombarding the attacking Communist forces. The air force also dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle from the air at night. From 5 AM onwards, our aircraft constantly flew over the outskirts of Yuepu and Yanghang, bombing and strafing the Communist forces hiding in the villages and towns of Taicang, Jiading, Gujiazai, Shenxiangzhai, Chuanxinzhai, Shengjiaqiao, and Xinzhen, killing nearly 10,000, destroying 80 trucks, 7 artillery positions, over 100 horses, over 100 wooden boats, 3 bunkers, and over 10 frontline fortifications.</p>
<p>In addition to concentrating its main force to bomb and strafe the Communist forces north of Shizilin, Yuepu, and Yanghang, achieving the above results, the air force also dispatched over 100 aircraft to patrol and bomb extensively in the outer areas of greater Shanghai, achieving the following main results:</p>
<p>(1) Near Weiting Station on the Suzhou-Kunshan highway, Mustang fighter planes discovered a convoy of over 20 Communist ammunition trucks. After strafing, the convoy exploded on the spot, leaving only 6 trucks. The highway surface was riddled with bomb craters. The low-flying Mustang was almost brought down by the blast.</p>
<p>(2) The air force discovered 30,000 Communist troops marching east from Jiaxing towards Jiashan, Songjiang, and from Songjiang towards Shanghai, killing over 3,000.</p>
<p>(3) Today, 12 large wooden boats carrying 1,500 Communist troops landed at Jinshan Hengquan Pavilion. 500 were killed by bombing.</p>
<p>(4) Over 1,000 Communist troops, along with over 20 mules, horses, and trucks, were marching along the highway from Jiaxing towards Pinghu and from Pinghu towards Jinshanwei. Over 300 were killed by strafing.</p>
<p>(5) Three Communist black command sedans were destroyed by bombing on the Changshu highway.</p>
<p>Further news: Starting at 7 PM on the 14th, the Communists began their continuous three-night night offensive against Shanghai. The focus of the defense of greater Shanghai remains on the outskirts of Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang. The army and navy are using artillery to counter the attacking Communist forces and using positions to prevent the Communist forces from breaking into this area. The air force has also dispatched a large number of aircraft to control the airspace at night. The night battles on the outskirts of Yuepu and Yanghang are even fiercer than last night.</p>
<h3>Military Observers Claim Nationalists Are Deploying Countless Pocket Defenses in Shanghai; Will Rival Verdun and Stalingrad</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] A military observer recently stated: The Nationalist army has deployed countless pocket defenses near Shanghai. Each pocket defense is surrounded by sufficient mobile forces, including infantry, artillery, tanks, and logistical support troops, and there is a detailed plan to counter the Communists' amoeba-like attacks. The current infiltration tactics can exert great effectiveness. Judging by the results of the 13th, the Communist army suffered 6,000 to 7,000 casualties in a single day. This was only a small pocket defense battle. If the entire battle unfolds and five pocket defense battles are fought each day, the Communist army may lose 30,000 men per day. Chen Yi's total strength is only 20 columns. Shanghai may become a Verdun of World War I or a Stalingrad of World War II. However, it is worth pondering what Chen Yi's strategic decisions will be for the Shanghai-Wusong battle in the future: a hard attack or an encirclement.</p>
<h3>Strong Defenses Deployed on Both Banks of Gan River; Communist Troops Annhilated Between Nanfeng and Nancheng</h3>

<h3>Nationalists Achieve Brilliant Victories in Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, and Other Areas; Liu Yuzhang's Troops Repeatedly Inflict Heavy Damage on Communist Forces</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Military source, 11 AM on the 14th:</p>
<p>(1) Over 10,000 Communist troops, using heavy artillery fire as cover, launched continuous attacks on our positions in Shizilin, Yuepu, and Yanghang from the evening of the 12th until the 14th. A certain unit of the Nationalist army bravely engaged the enemy, and a certain artillery unit demonstrated its power. After a day of fierce fighting, thanks to the efforts of the officers and soldiers, the attacking Communists were either encircled and annihilated or repelled. Over 5,000 Communists were killed or wounded, and countless weapons were captured. The brilliant results are being tallied.</p>
<p>(2) At 3 AM on the 14th, over 5,000 Communist troops, using artillery fire as cover, infiltrated towards Shizilin, Yuepu, and Niujiaojian in several groups. The defending troops calmly responded. The fighting was fierce. The Communist troops launched several fierce attacks, but all were repelled. At around 5 AM, our troops launched a thunderous offensive, killing over 500 Communists, capturing 300, and resulting in a company commander leading his entire company to surrender to our side with their weapons.</p>
<p>(3) Over 200 Communist troops who had briefly infiltrated the outposts of our army in Yuepu and Niujiaojian on the 13th have been annihilated, with over 50 captured and 2 light machine guns, 5 submachine guns, and over 30 rifles seized.</p>
<p>(4) At 2 AM on the morning of the 14th, about a regiment of Communist troops infiltrated towards Taiping Bridge, northwest of Liuhang. After an hour of fierce fighting, the Communists were repelled, with over 200 killed or wounded, and a Communist squad leader and over 30 soldiers captured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] According to the Shanghai-Wusong Defense Command: (1) On the 13th, Communist troops gathered seven to eight regiments of soldiers and dozens of heavy cannons, launching fierce attacks on our Yuepu and Niujiaojian positions, east of the Ye family, south of Shizilin. The fighting was extremely intense. Our defending troops under Liu Yuzhang calmly responded, dealing a heavy blow to the attacking Communists. The results of this battle were brilliant. In addition to killing 4,612 Communist troops, many spoils of war were captured.</p>
<p>(2) In the early morning of the 14th, after suffering setbacks in their offensive, the Communist troops facing Yuepu reassembled their main forces and launched a fierce attack on our Niujiaojian and Wangjiapai positions, with some attempting to infiltrate our positions using trench warfare tactics. The defending troops are closely monitoring and firmly defending.</p>
<p>(3) At midnight on the 13th, taking advantage of our nighttime unpreparedness, the Communist troops attempted to raid Yuepu. However, under the close monitoring and attacks of our defending troops under Liu Yuzhang, all 100 or so attacking Communists were encircled and annihilated, with no survivors and 52 captured alive. 12 light machine guns, 43 rifles, and 5 submachine guns were seized. Our casualties were 29.</p>
<p>(4) From the morning of the 13th, the Communist troops repeatedly launched fierce attacks on our positions in Yuepu, Yanghang, Niujiaojian, and Shizilin, but all were repelled by our troops. 457 Communist corpses were left outside the bunkers.</p>
<p>(5) On the 13th, General Liu Yuzhang personally went to the front line in Yuepu to supervise the battle and provide instructions. Morale is high, the fortifications are strong, and there is no doubt that we will be victorious.</p>
<h3>Wartime Far East British Commander Talks About the Defense of Hong Kong: Assistance Needed from the United States, the British Commonwealth, and Federal Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 13th] The wartime commander of British forces in the Far East declared on the 13th that the effective defense of Hong Kong requires assistance from the United States, the British Commonwealth, and federal nations. Without sufficient naval and air forces to control bases within a short distance in cooperation, no matter how strong the Hong Kong garrison is, it cannot hold the area. Before the war, the British Far East Fleet had abundant strength and the friendship of China. It was estimated that the British army could independently defend Hong Kong for only 90 days. Now, the estimated number of days that can be sustained must be reduced unless the British garrison can reliably obtain naval and air force bases for support from the United States and other friendly powers in the Pacific.</p>
<p>According to the former British Far East naval commander, in 1935, the British and American navies had a "gentleman's agreement." At that time, the strength of the British Far East fleet was reduced because a portion was transferred to the Mediterranean to deal with the threat posed by Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>The air force commander said that the air force is extremely important to defend Hong Kong, but air force bases require considerable planning. The closest air force base that would not fall into the hands of the Chinese Communists is in the Philippine Islands. Once Hong Kong encounters a full-scale attack, the intention of the British to defend the area can only be implemented through a planned regional defense approach. This regional defense approach must include American territories and is essentially equivalent to a Pacific defense treaty.</p>
<h3>British Spitfire Squadron Flies to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[United Press Clark Airfield, Philippines, 13th] Nine British Royal Air Force Spitfire aircraft flew to Hong Kong this morning to join the original squadron. This batch of aircraft flew from Singapore on Wednesday and completed the final leg of their journey this morning.</p>
<p>It was originally planned that ten Spitfire aircraft would fly to Hong Kong. According to the squadron leader, Yu Er, upon arrival in Kuching, Sarawak, one of the aircraft overturned and was damaged, so the aircraft was left behind. However, the pilot was not injured and traveled to Hong Kong on the accompanying Dakota aircraft.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 14th] The British destroyer Black Swan will arrive in Hong Kong from Shanghai at 10:00 AM on the 16th. The ship went to the Yangtze River earlier this month to assist the British warship Amethyst and was involved in artillery battles with the Communist army en route.</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Chifley Says No Consideration Given to Sending Troops to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[United Press Canberra, 13th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley stated at a press conference today that the Australian government has not considered sending Australian troops to Hong Kong, nor has it received a request for assistance. There have been no consultations between the Australian and Soviet governments regarding the use of the rocket range in southern Australia, as there is already an agreement between the British and Australian governments regarding the use of this rocket range.</p>
<h3>Philippine House of Representatives Changes Location of Embassy in China</h3>
<p>Changing Nanjing to China to Facilitate Relocation</p>
<p>[United Press Manila, 13th] In view of the unstable situation in China, the Philippine House of Representatives last night amended a clause in the budget that specified Nanjing as the location of the Philippine diplomatic mission in China, changing "Nanjing" to "China" so that the diplomatic mission could move from one location to another within China if necessary.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives also voted to abolish the position of consul in Hong Kong. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the position of consul in Hong Kong was abolished because the person appointed to the position was not accepted by some members of Congress.</p>
<h3>U.S. China Policy Inevitably to be Thoroughly Revised</h3>
<p>Remarks by Senator Wiley</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 13th] Leading Republican Senator Wiley asserted today that the Truman administration's China policy is bound to be thoroughly revised. Wiley predicted that the Senate would intensify pressure on the government to restore diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain and would seek to discuss the Spanish issue ahead of schedule. Wiley expressed his opposition, saying: "The China issue should be discussed first. Those who are urging recognition of the Spanish government today are the same people who initially supported the organization of a coalition government in China." It is reported that Democratic Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally and influential Republican Senator Vandenberg have both supported restoring relations with Spain.</p>

<h3>Sunday Forum: The Problem of Prisoners of War in International Wars</h3>
<p>— Ji Heqin</p>
<p>In recent years, wars have been continuous. The bloodstains of World War II have not yet dried, and new international wars are brewing. The most shocking atomic weapons are now known to all countries and are no longer surprising. New killing weapons are emerging one after another. Human culture seems to be moving backward. Weapons are changing with each passing day, and strategies are also advancing daily. However, humanitarianism in war has not only not progressed but has regressed to 2,000 years ago. Not to mention anything else, just the issue of prisoners of war can show the situation.</p>
<p>The Book of Documents says: "Exterminate the ringleaders, do not punish the followers." This means that in war, it is only necessary to eliminate the leaders and not to punish their followers. The Zuo Zhuan says: "A gentleman does not inflict a second wound," meaning that if the enemy is already injured and unable to fight, there is no need to harm him again. Sima Rangju said: "If the enemy is injured, provide medicine and return him." This means that if the enemy is injured and captured, his wounds should be treated with medicine and he should be sent back. This shows that the foundation of Chinese history and culture is built on humanitarianism.</p>
<p>Eighty-five years ago, the Swiss invented the Red Cross as a neutral organization. On August 22, 1864, the Geneva Convention was established regarding the treatment of military personnel in the battlefield. A total of 55 countries participated in succession. China joined the organization in 1904, introduced by Japan. Article 5 of the treaty states: "All people in the country who go to the front lines to rescue wounded soldiers have the right to freedom and respect. All officers and soldiers of belligerent countries are responsible for notifying the people of their rights to neutral aid and the rescue of wounded soldiers. Any person who houses and cares for wounded soldiers in their home should be protected, and the army must not occupy it. In addition, if war taxes are levied, a portion may be exempted." Article 6 states: "All wounded and sick soldiers, regardless of nationality, should be accepted and treated. To the extent possible, with the agreement of both parties, military officers have the right to immediately return wounded enemy soldiers to the enemy front line during the war. Any wounded soldier who has recovered and is deemed unable to fight may also be sent back to his country. All soldiers and management personnel who are returned shall enjoy absolute neutrality." The Hague Convention, established on July 29, 1899, regarding maritime hospitals and ambulance ships, is also generally the same as land rescue. According to the above regulations, many of today's prisoners of war have not been able to enjoy the benefits of this treaty. This is not only unfortunate for the prisoners of war but also due to the failure of military officers and public and private organizations responsible for rescuing the wounded and sick to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<p>On July 6, 1906, the Geneva Convention improved the treatment of wounded and sick soldiers on the battlefield. Article 1 states that all military personnel and officially accompanying personnel, when injured or sick, regardless of nationality, should be treated by the belligerent group responsible for the management of the personnel, and should be respected. If belligerent countries are forced to abandon wounded and sick personnel to the enemy, they should also consider the military situation at the time and leave behind as many medical personnel and medical supplies as possible to facilitate treatment. Article 2 states that if the personnel fall into the hands of the enemy and become prisoners, the humanitarian principles regarding the treatment of prisoners should be adopted. Belligerent countries are free to formulate agreements that meet the following points for wounded or sick prisoners: (1) After each battle, wounded personnel abandoned on the battlefield should be returned to each other. (2) All wounded or sick personnel who, after recovering or when their illness has subsided enough to be transferred, are no longer willing to be prisoners by the belligerent group may be sent back to their country. (3) If the consent of a neutral country is obtained, wounded or sick personnel of the enemy may be sent to the neutral country, which shall be responsible for guarding them until the end of the war. Article 3 states that after each battle, the victorious belligerent group should immediately try to collect and protect wounded or dead soldiers to prevent looting and abuse. The victorious party must be cautious in the burial or pre-cremation examination of the dead.</p>
<p>The Hague Convention of October 18, 1907, made more progress on the preferential treatment of prisoners. For example, Article 4 states: Prisoners of war are under the authority of the enemy government, not under the authority of the person or group that captured them. Prisoners should be treated in accordance with humanitarian principles. With the exception of weapons, horses, and military documents, all other private property belonging to the prisoners remains the property of the prisoners. Article 5: Cities, fortresses, barracks, or other residences may be used to guard prisoners, and prisoners may not leave the designated area. Imprisonment is only permitted when necessary to maintain order. Article 6: With the exception of officers among the prisoners, the state may, according to their rank and skills, employ prisoners to work, but the work must not be excessive and must be limited to matters unrelated to the war. Prisoners may work for public institutions, private individuals, or for themselves. Prisoners who work must be paid wages equal to those of military personnel working in the country. If there is no provision for military wages, the work should be estimated and given a reasonable price. If working for other public institutions or private individuals, the conditions for the price of the work must be negotiated with the military authorities. In addition to deducting living expenses, the wages earned by prisoners should be sufficient to improve their situation. If there is a surplus, it should be settled and paid in full upon release.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, on July 27, 1929, countries around the world again concluded a treaty in Geneva to improve the treatment of wounded soldiers, and stated in the introduction: "Each signatory country recognizes that in the midst of intense warfare, it should do its best to reduce the unavoidable suffering of prisoners, improve their treatment, and develop the principles of the Hague Peace Conference, with particular emphasis on the military laws and customs of war attached to the conference." The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Wounded and sick soldiers should be respected and protected in any environment, treated humanely, and have their rights protected regardless of nationality. If some troops are forced to abandon their wounded and sick soldiers to the enemy, they should, to the extent possible given military needs, retain some medical personnel and their supplies to assist in their care.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to the protection and retention of wounded and sick soldiers listed in the above article, wounded and sick soldiers of a country's army who fall into the power of the enemy's army become prisoners and are entitled to the public provisions stipulated for ordinary criminals, but the army may, when it deems necessary, formulate regulations that are superior to the current laws in order to give preferential treatment to wounded and sick soldiers.</p>
<p>(3) After each battle, the occupier of the war zone should try to search for wounded and dead soldiers to protect them from looting or abuse. In any war environment, the two countries' armies should set a local truce or ceasefire to facilitate the search for wounded soldiers trapped in the two fronts.</p>
<p>(4) Field armies should, within the shortest possible time, notify each other of the names of wounded, sick, and dead soldiers of the other side collected or discovered, and records that can be used as evidence. Field armies should establish sergeants' death lists and send them to each other, with half of the soldiers' badges sent to their home country's army and the other half left on the dead. Field armies should pay attention to conducting careful examinations before burying or cremating the dead, or, if possible, using drugs to test them to explore the truth of death. In addition, attention must be paid to the honor of the deceased's burial, the respect of the tomb, and appropriate symbols to facilitate future identification. In order to fulfill this article, field armies should formally organize tomb construction offices at the beginning of the war so that even if the number of burials is large, corpses can be exhumed at any time, and no errors occur in the deceased's surname. After the end of the war, the two countries' armies should immediately exchange tomb lists and lists of the names of the dead buried in public cemeteries or elsewhere.</p>
<p>(5) Army commanders may solicit local enthusiasts to house and care for wounded and sick soldiers in the army, but they must be subject to the commander's inspection, and the recruits should be given special protection and considerable convenience.</p>
<p>The above is said to apply to international wars, but the tragic civil wars are also applicable. After World War II, several countries experienced civil wars in succession, and the issue of the treatment of prisoners of war was not given due attention. From a humanitarian point of view, both sides of the civil war should abide by international conventions.</p>
<h3>True Picture of Peace in Beiping: Guangzhou Central Daily News Publishes Article by Wu Yanhai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th] Since the 7th of this month, the Central Daily News has continuously published an article by Wu Yanhai entitled "The True Picture of Peace in Beiping." As an eyewitness, with a calm and objective attitude, the article describes in detail the fall of Beiping, which the Communist Party calls a "peace model." Starting today, the full text will be broadcast in installments as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Foreword</p>
<p>Since Beiping was locked behind the Iron Curtain, northern compatriots who have fled and left behind many relatives and friends are eager to get some news from their hometown. Concerned compatriots across the country, because Beiping is referred to as a peace model by the Communist Party, also want to hear about the situation there. Although there have often been some fragmented reports in newspapers, they are all piecemeal and still difficult to satisfy the desires of the general public. The author flew to Beiping on January 8 to visit his sick father and escaped as a disguised peddler on March 19, bypassing Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan. I recently arrived in Guangzhou after many twists and turns. I spent a lot of time in Beiping during the siege and liberation. Because the leaders of all circles in Hebei, Pingjin were old friends for many years, and many residents there were relatives and old friends, I knew more about the siege, the brewing of peace, the ease of defense, and all kinds of inside information. After arriving in Guangzhou, friends who care about Beiping asked about this one after another. Seeing one person, I would say it once; seeing two people, I would say it twice. Once I opened the conversation, it would take two or three hours. In addition to this long journey, I had to socialize three or four times a day, which was really exhausting. To avoid laziness, I wrote "The True Picture of Peace in Beiping" as a "comprehensive report."</p>
<p>(2) Before the Siege</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, Mr. Fu Zuoyi has been stationed in Chahar and Suiyuan, advocating national freedom, political democracy, and economic equality. He also practiced what he preached, wearing plain clothes, eating simple meals, and living in the same way as his soldiers. He was also humble and always held work review meetings, using new methods at any time. Therefore, for more than ten years, he has been invincible. The central government has always relied on him as the Great Wall of the North. At the end of the 36th year, the military was defeated in the Northeast, and Shijiazhuang, Hebei, fell. The General Headquarters re-deployed and established the North China Suppression General Headquarters. From then on, the five provinces and two cities were handed over to him. The land was large and the soldiers were few. At that time, many friends were worried about him, but Mr. Fu had strong confidence and declared that if the Northeast could hold firm for one year, by the end of the 38th year, he could be responsible for ensuring that North China would be safe. After that, he worked diligently, held two military and political discussions, and implemented the control surface for guerrilla suppression. Shi Yousan's cavalry even conducted guerrilla suppression in Hejian, which had been a Communist Party supply station base for more than ten years, and won a great victory. He also organized a Jin-aid corps and raided Shijiazhuang. The strong will of the generals and the vigorous morale of the soldiers were truly unparalleled for a time. Unfortunately, before his preparations were complete, after November last year, Jinzhou withdrew, Changshen changed hands, and the entire Northeast changed color. Mr. Fu had only more than 400,000 troops under his command, which was not enough to deal with Nie Rongzhen's unit. After that, Lin Biao led hundreds of thousands of troops to the south in victory, and the fate of North China can be imagined. It is said that the General Headquarters had the following plans at that time: (1) Withdraw from North China and transfer all forces to northern Jiangsu to participate in the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. After this battle was won, they would go north along the Jinpu Railway and seek development. (2) Move the North China Suppression General Headquarters to Tanggu and withdraw the forces in Baoding, Zhangjiakou, and other places. Let Li Wen lead the 13th and 16th armies to garrison Beiping alone. The remaining troops would be concentrated in the coastal areas of Tianjin, Tanggu, and Tangshan. After that, central aid and US aid could come from the sea in a steady stream, and advance and retreat would be easy. It is said that Mr. Fu adopted the second plan at that time. First, the main suppression force was withdrawn from Baoding. Because his own troops were in Zhangjiakou, he went there twice to discuss the withdrawal plan. However, because the local councils and mass organizations tearfully pleaded to stay, and after two days of meetings, they could not bear to make a final decision. In this uncertain time, Lin Biao's Communist army quickly arrived at Nankou via Jiandao and cut off the withdrawal route. He had no choice but to quickly order on December 13 to concentrate the troops from various places in Pingjin, Zhangtang to avoid being eaten piecemeal again. Thus, the siege began on the 14th.</p>
<p>(3) Solitary Army Defending Bitterly</p>
<p>After December 14, the five provinces and two cities under the jurisdiction of the entire North China Suppression General Headquarters Fu, except for Suiyuan, which still maintained half a province, only had six isolated points left: Taiyuan, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Tanggu, and Beiping and Tianjin. Taiyuan and Datong were actually the responsibility of Mr. Yan, so I won't discuss them here. The remaining four isolated points were directly commanded by Mr. Fu. It is said that the initial wishful thinking was: (1) Still order the troops in Zhangjiakou to break through to Ping; (2) After the victory of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, the central government could reinforce from Tanggu; (8) The Beiping troops, in addition to leaving the 13th and 16th armies, would take the opportunity to rush to Jingu and recover the coastal area, and still complete the original deployment. Therefore, at the beginning of the siege, Mr. Fu was still not discouraged, and the morale of the troops below was still high. However, a series of facts later negated everything. The first was the complete martyrdom of the 35th Army and the Provisional 3rd Army in Xinbaoan, south of Zhangjiakou. Army Commander Guo Juezhi. Army Commander Chunshan only escaped with his life. This battle was indeed too tragic. It is said that Lin Biao's troops were extremely angry because the two armies had repeatedly refused to surrender, so they used the artillery they had just obtained from the Northeast to continuously bombard the city with tens of thousands of rounds. No houses in the city survived, and many gaps were also blasted in the city walls. When it was captured, only a few hundred living people were captured in the city. After that, Mr. Fu's basic troops were finished, and his confidence was lost. Then came the unexpected disastrous defeat of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. The backer was finished, and rescue was hopeless. Many people were wondering how two armies could hold Tianjin, which had vast suburbs, no city walls, and no city walls. Beiping had more than 2 million citizens and 300,000 troops, and had to consume at least more than 3 million catties of food every day. Even if the central government could send 500 planes to airdrop every day, each plane carrying two tons, it would still be of no avail, not to mention bullets and other supplies. Therefore, around New Year's Day in the 38th year, Mr. Fu's mood was extremely bad, and he often paced around the room, sullen and speechless, and even slapped himself on both cheeks, the sound shaking the outdoors. The suffering in his heart can be known from this. However, very few people outside knew about this situation, so the social order in Beiping was very good, and the morale was not low, because he was a famous general who defended the city, and everyone had confidence in him. I flew to Tanggu on January 8 to visit my sick father, taking the first passenger plane from Shanghai after the self-cut route. It was the 24th day after the siege, using the newly repaired Tiantan Airport. After leaving the airport, I saw that Tianqiao was still bustling and prosperous as before. Walking to Dongdan Archway, I saw a crowd of civilians busy repairing Dongdan Airport. Although the prices of rice, flour, pork, and vegetables were soaring, there was no shortage of goods on the market. Theaters and cinemas only had one less show in the evening due to the curfew. The entire city of Beiping, except for the fact that there were more troops on the streets, felt no different. However, the city gates were tightly closed, and sandbags were piled up at every important intersection. Every day at dawn or dusk, there would often be a small or large burst of dense gunfire. Several small and large shells flew to the vicinity of Fuchengmen and the north and south pools, killing a total of more than a dozen residents before and after. As for the movements of the Communist army outside the city, there was no way to know. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Three Military Governors Approve West Berlin's Autonomy Regulations; Four Powers Negotiate to Restore Trade Relations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 14th] The military governors of the United States, Britain, and France today approved the autonomy regulations of West Berlin, which stipulate that Germans directly manage the administration of the western districts of Berlin, but the three commanders still retain broad supervisory powers, especially the power to disarm, demand reparations, conduct foreign relations, and manage German war criminals. The occupying forces also have the right to issue emergency orders to ensure the security, financial stability, and economic security of West Berlin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 14th] The declaration of principles on the relationship between the Allied Control Council of West Germany and the administration of Greater Berlin was signed today in Berlin by the three commanders and delivered to the Berlin municipal government. The three commanders declared that, due to the special situation in Berlin, the occupation regulations of West Germany cannot be applied to Berlin, but the three commanders decided that, if possible, some lenient plans will be applied to Berlin, while retaining the rights of the Four-Power Control Council to guarantee the security, financial, and economic security of Berlin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] A British spokesman claimed tonight that the Four Powers held their first talks in Berlin today in many months, but he declined to disclose the details of the meeting. The news of this Four-Power meeting was first revealed by the Economic Minister of the West Berlin municipal government, Mr. Klingelhofer, who said at a press conference that representatives of Western countries met with Soviet representatives today to discuss the restoration of trade between Berlin and the West, and another meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Provisional Institution to be Established Before the Formation of the West German Government; Organizing Committee to Handle Administration</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Godesberg, Germany, 13th] The prime ministers of the West German states began meeting here today in order for the West German states to approve the constitution of the German Republic before the Four-Power Foreign Ministers meet on May 23. The three military governors yesterday authorized the West German prime ministers to begin preparations for the establishment of a federal government. They established three subcommittees today, one to find housing for the government, one to prepare legislation, and one to draft a government organization plan. If the constitution can be approved in time, it can be promulgated on the day the Foreign Ministers meeting is convened.</p>
<h3>Prices Fall in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] Since the lifting of the Berlin blockade, food prices in West Berlin have fallen sharply, especially vegetable prices, which have fallen by about 60%. American coffee, previously sold on the black market for 28 marks per pound, fell to 15 marks today. The currency market has also reacted significantly, and the price of banknotes issued by the occupying forces has plummeted on the black market.</p>
<h3>US and Soviet Union Seek Understanding: War Can Be Avoided</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The Bishop of Canterbury, Mr. Johnson, said in a speech here today that the Soviet Union definitely does not want war, and the events of the past few days are proof of this. When he traveled to the United States last year, he discovered that the general public in the United States also did not want war; they only wanted peace and understanding. He also said that the Marshall Plan has many contradictions, and we would rather tighten our belts than accept this kind of money.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Mr. Miliacas, a Labour Party Member of Parliament, said at a meeting of the British-Czech Friendship Alliance here today that there will be no war during the Labour Party's tenure, because the Labour government and the majority party in the House of Commons do not want Britain to participate in the war. He believes that the Atlantic Treaty is unnecessary, superfluous, and dangerous.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Passes Convention on Freedom of the Press; Protecting the Freedom of Foreign Journalists to Report</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly this morning passed the world's first treaty on freedom of the the press, called the "International Convention on the Transmission and Right of Correction of News." The vote was 33 to 6, with 13 abstentions and 7 absent. The Soviet bloc voted against. The full text of the convention has 23 articles, stipulating that reporters from newspapers, radio, and film in all countries will enjoy the right to report news in the United States and other democratic countries and to correct mistakes automatically. The convention will not require ratification by countries for seven months, because a large-scale news treaty will be drafted at the UN General Assembly's autumn meeting, and the two treaties will be submitted to the governments of all countries for ratification together in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government to Request the Far Eastern Commission to Cancel All Reparations from Japan; US Decides Only to Stop Preliminary Reparations Plan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] The Japanese government intends to request the Far Eastern Commission to completely stop reparations payments, so that Japan can engage in economic reconstruction. Mr. Yamaguchi, the director of the Japanese government's Reparations Bureau, expressed this intention in the House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>He said: The recent decision by the United States to suspend reparations payments only pertains to the plan for the initial 30% of reparations. He believes that the Far Eastern Commission has the right to decide on further reparations payments. He revealed that the Japanese government intends to have all factories designated for reparations fully operational.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese government officials hoped on the 14th that the United States would take action to cancel further Japanese reparations, as announced by the Far Eastern Commission, and they hoped that this move would mean the end of all reparations from Japan. A government spokesman told the National Assembly Committee that one-third of the removal plan in the 30% initial reparations plan had been completed in accordance with MacArthur's orders, and these factories were all former arsenals. He said that if the plan to stop further reparations is realized, then the 2.6 billion yen in reparations expenses in this year's budget may be used for other purposes. Mr. Shiga, a spokesman for the Japanese Communist Party, warned that the government should adopt a wait-and-see policy at present, because the plan to stop further reparations must be approved by the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
<h3>The Right to Decide on Reparations Should Be the Responsibility of the Far Eastern Commission; Opinions of Wu Bannong, Chinese Representative to Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] Regarding the US government's order to suspend the Japanese reparations plan, Mr. Wu Bannong, the head of the Economic Group of the Chinese Mission in Japan, told the United Press today that, in the view of this mission, the United States should only abolish the directive on the early transfer plan and should not cancel its entire reparations plan. This entire reparations plan comes from Japan's war obligations. The Allied countries have legitimate demands for war losses and destruction. The final right to decide on reparations should be given to the Far Eastern Commission, in which all Allied countries are represented. Moreover, according to the Potsdam Declaration and the basic policy after Japan's surrender, a major purpose of the Japanese reparations issue is to eliminate its war potential, so that it can no longer launch aggressive wars against neighboring countries to endanger world peace. The early transfer plan only covers 30% of the Japanese government's arsenals. All of its aircraft factories and private arms factories have not been touched at all, not to mention the countless industries that assist in the war. These industries cannot contribute to Japan's economic life, because Japan has not yet been able to fully utilize its peaceful industrial equipment today. Finally, this mission cannot help but doubt whether the United States' current policy on the reparations issue is wise, but this is too important and should be left to future historians to judge.</p>
<h3>The Philippines Will Lodge a Strong Protest Against US Measures</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 14th] Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Nali, said on the 14th that the US policy of stopping Japanese reparations payments is "a serious blow to us," and the government will immediately draft a strong protest to be submitted by Mr. Romulo, the Philippine Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Representative to the Far Eastern Commission. Nali said: "We can only appeal to the Quirino-Foster Agreement, which clearly stipulates the obligations of the countries occupying Japan. The US announcement completely caught us by surprise." Nali also said: "He will contact Romulo by radio to discuss this issue."</p>
<h3>More Than 600 Japanese Factories are Likely to Be Retained; Prices in Tokyo Stock Market Soar</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] Due to the United States' decision not to extract further reparations from Japan, 685 private factories and shipyards that have been designated for reparations will be retained, which will accelerate Japan's industrial and economic reconstruction. Although these factories designated for reparations are not fully operational, the 470 that are operational play a very important role in the reconstruction of Japan's post-war economy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] Immediately after the United States announced its new policy of no longer extracting further reparations from Japan, stock prices in the stock market here soared. Some steel stocks rose by 50%, electricity stocks rose by 20% to 30%, and shipping company stocks rose by 35%.</p>
<h3>Iran Incorporates Indigenous People</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 13th] Iranian indigenous tribes, which have always been a problem for the Iranian central government, will be incorporated into the government's defense plan and become auxiliary forces of the army. It is estimated that there are about 4 million indigenous people in Iran, accounting for one-third of the country's population. Most of them live in the border mountains. After the incorporation, it will greatly benefit the promotion of domestic security.</p>
<h3>UN Political Committee Approves Plan to Dispose of Italian Colonies; Libya to Be Placed Under the Trusteeship of Three Countries: Britain, France, and Italy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 13th] The United Nations Political Committee today passed a resolution by a vote of 34 to 16, largely approving the agreement reached between Britain and Italy on the future status of Italian colonies. There were seven abstentions in the vote. The agreement was reached in London last Monday between British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Italian Foreign Minister Sforza, and includes the following recommendations:</p>
<p>(1) Cyrenaica in Libya will be placed under international trusteeship, with Britain as the governing authority. (2) The Fezzan region of Libya will have France as the governing authority. (3) Tripolitania in Libya will be placed under international trusteeship under Italian administration until the end of 1951. Before the end of 1951, it will continue to be governed by Britain, with an advisory committee composed of one representative each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy, Turkey, and local residents assisting it. In addition, it is expressly stipulated that the aforementioned three measures shall not hinder the final merger of the three regions into a unified Libya. (4) Italian Somaliland will be placed under international trusteeship, with Italy as the governing authority. (5) Eritrea, except for its western part, will be incorporated into Abyssinia, and appropriate guarantees will be adopted to protect minority groups, but the two cities of Asmara and Massawa will draft their own city constitutions, provided that the provisions do not harm Abyssinian sovereignty. Western Eritrea will be incorporated into British-Egyptian Sudan.</p>
<p>The agreement including the aforementioned provisions will be submitted to the next UN General Assembly. However, the part regarding Tripolitania will be discussed by the Sixth UN General Assembly in 1951. The UN Trusteeship Council and a small-scale general assembly will participate in the drafting of these agreements. When the Political Committee voted on the proposal, the 34 countries that supported it were Britain, the United States, France, and countries in the Americas and Western Europe. The 16 countries that opposed it were the six countries in the Soviet bloc, the six countries in the Arab bloc, as well as India, Pakistan, Burma, and the Philippines. The seven countries that abstained were China, Haiti, Israel, Siam, Sweden, and Turkey.</p>
<h3>Syngman Rhee Opposes North-South Korean Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 13th] Korean President Syngman Rhee stated: Even though US troops in South Korea will soon be withdrawn, there is no possibility of holding a conference between North and South Korea. Regarding the rumors about a North-South Korean conference, some people even believe that it is possible, and even hope that the North Korean puppet government may cooperate with the communists to occupy South Korea. However, he firmly believes that the general public knows who is spreading these rumors and what their purpose is. Rhee said: He first heard from Mr. Shaw, the representative of the United Nations Commission on Korea from Australia, that the committee is trying to contact North Korean leaders somewhere in Korea to formulate a plan for Korean unification. This may be Shaw's personal opinion. The committee does not want North and South Korea to hold a meeting.</p>
<h3>After Receiving Assistance from Four Countries of the British Commonwealth, Burma Will Start Training a New Army; Ambassadors from the Four Countries to Burma Are Currently in Discussions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rangoon, 14th] Burmese Foreign Minister, Mr. Ma Yi, said today that the British Commonwealth has agreed to provide financial and military assistance to the Burmese government to quell the unrest, and the Burmese people do not need to worry. We have obtained sufficient military supplies and only lack manpower. The current task is to train soldiers to use weapons. It is essential to prevent this equipment from falling into the hands of the rebels. Restoring security should be the primary goal. Economic reconstruction cannot begin without restoring security.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 14th] The Indian government announced today that the ambassadors of Britain, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon to Burma have been ordered to draft a military plan for Burma. The four ambassadors will continue to meet in Rangoon today, and the assistance plan is expected to be drafted by the end of the week.</p>
<h3>Matthews Kimball Appointed US Secretary and Undersecretary of the Navy; Gray Promoted to Acting Secretary of the Army</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 13th] President Truman today appointed Mr. Matthews, a lawyer and civic leader from Omaha, Nebraska, as Secretary of the Navy, to succeed Mr. Sullivan, who resigned last month. In addition, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Kimball was appointed as Undersecretary of the Navy. The appointments of Matthews and Kimball must be approved by the Senate.</p>
<p>Matthews, 62, is a prominent Catholic. In addition to practicing law, he also has private businesses, including banking and a radio station. Since 1933, he has served as a legal advisor to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a US government agency in Nebraska and Wymondham, Vermont. In 1946, he served on the President's Committee on Civil Rights. When Matthews met with reporters today, he said that he fully agrees with "the clear desire of the American people to unify the armed forces." Matthews said that he has no experience in the Navy, but he continued, "One of the strengths of this country is that the armed forces are controlled by civilians."</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 13th] The White House announced today that the President has appointed a new Undersecretary of the Army, who is Mr. Gray, the current Assistant Secretary of the Army.</p>
<p>Before a successor to former Secretary Royal is appointed, Gray will temporarily manage the Department of the Army.</p>
<h3>Arab-Israeli Peace Treaty Will Be Signed in Lausanne; Syrian-Israeli Armistice Talks Postponed</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 13th] Mr. Ethridge, the US representative to the United Nations Conciliation Commission, told reporters today that he believes that the Arab-Israeli peace treaty will be signed in Lausanne soon. He said, "Both sides are eager for peace. I believe that an agreement can be reached in the short term on the issues of border demarcation and the handling of refugees."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Haifa, 13th] The Syrian-Israeli armistice talks reopened this morning in Mishmar HaYarden, but it was decided this afternoon to postpone them again until next Tuesday. The Israeli representative today requested clarification on several points in the ceasefire line proposal submitted by the United Nations mediator, Mr. Bunche.

After a brief consultation between the Syrian and Israeli representatives, it was decided to consult their respective governments. It was announced here that if the two sides can reach an agreement in accordance with Bunche's proposal, then the armistice talks will proceed quickly until a full agreement is reached.</p>
<h3>US Military Aid to Western Europe Requires 1.3 Billion; President Will Submit Plan to Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] The US State Department announced today that Western Europe's current defense is too weak to invite military aggression, and the United States must help it rebuild its defense. Its first-year military aid program amounts to 1.3 billion US dollars, and will be increased further thereafter. The State Department detailed its six-point plan to help free countries strengthen their defenses for the first time in a formally released "Peace Document." This plan will be submitted to Congress by President Truman soon.</p>
<h3>The Depression of 1929 Will Not Be Repeated Today: Opinions of American Economists</h3>
<p>[Washington, D.C., American News Service, 12th] On May 10, the Le Roy News Observer published an editorial entitled, "Have We Learned Our Lesson Enough?" stating: Renowned economist Soule published an article in the Sunday New York Times magazine, in which he presented a forceful affirmative answer to the question, "Have we learned our lesson enough from the situation in 1929?"</p>
<p>Mr. Soule listed the commonly recognized causes of the depression that began in 1929 and presented convincing evidence that various preventive measures have been established, which at least can prevent us from experiencing the same severe depression as that which occurred a decade ago. However, while there is no doubt that our country has learned from the experiences of 1929, the question is whether we have learned enough to avoid a milder depression. On this question, Mr. Soule's answer is less convincing, and only time can provide a complete answer. However, simply listing the various recognized causes of the last depression is enough to show that some past mistakes are not being repeated. Mr. Soule lists these causes as follows: the stock market crash; easy lending that led to excessive construction of skyscrapers and commercial buildings, a decline in the housing boom (which peaked in 1926); the excessive stimulation of the automobile industry market due to the popularity of installment plans, a false favorable balance of trade, which was maintained by unreliable foreign investment; special technological improvements that benefited large enterprises more than consumers, and (last but certainly not least) the suffering of farmers, because they were hit much harder in the initial depression than industry, so they later had no power to cope with the ensuing depression. Today, the huge profits obtained by companies are no greater than those obtained after World War I (until a few years ago it was proved that the profits obtained after World War I were fictitious). But with this one exception, there have been great improvements in the various situations listed by Mr. Soule since 1929. In the use of bank loans, we may have made the mistake of going too far. Many banks do not lend indiscriminately, but seem to have forgotten that lending is a bank's primary task. But of course, there will be no near-failure of banking business, which would deepen and prolong the last depression. The stock market is also in danger of collapsing, for the simple reason that the general public has withdrawn from the market, and speculators have to use their own money to trade. Private investment overseas is not adventurous on a large scale, and there is no excessive construction and artificial stimulation of the market for automobiles and similar things. Finally, the situation of farmers is much better than in 1929. Between 1940 and 1949, their mortgage debts decreased from $6.6 billion to $4.9 billion, and their cash on hand and bank deposits increased from $3.9 billion to $15.6 billion. In addition, they purchased $4.7 billion worth of government bonds. All this adds up to a gratifying picture. But on top of this picture, one indisputable fact must be added: the recent welcome price declines have produced an unwelcome increase in unemployment. What is the reason? Compared with 1929, it can be seen that prices are still very high, and many industries are still making unreasonably huge profits. But all in all, as long as people have cash to save and do not borrow recklessly, there is no great chance that the depression of 1929 will be repeated.</p>
<p>Snyder Denies That American Commerce Will Decline</p>
<p>[Washington, D.C., American News Service, 13th] U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder said that the current U.S. economy is exceptionally strong, although some people predict that American commerce will decline. On Thursday, Snyder spoke to bankers from across the country, stating that under the current circumstances, there are four powerful factors that can keep us stable at "high income and high employment levels." He listed these factors as follows: No speculation - "In the prosperous years after the war, there was practically no speculation. In the commercial history of our country, every recession has always been preceded by a large settlement of speculative accounts. The absence of this characteristic at present is, in my view, the most different from the previous periods of decline." Gradual adjustment of post-war industry - "Most of the past commercial recessions were unanticipated, and the recession became serious because many aspects of the economy were adjusted at the same time. However, the current situation is different. Adjustments to make the economy more genuinely competitive have actually been underway since the end of the war." High income levels and accumulation of savings - "One particularly noteworthy point is that consumer purchases are continuing to support high levels with income and are being maintained with savings reaching unprecedented records. Personal income in March of this year - the most recent figure known - is $214,000,000,000 on an annual basis. Although this figure is slightly lower than the all-time peak in December last year, it is still higher than the level a year ago. Personal liquid assets - another name for accumulated purchasing power - currently amount to $200 billion." Technological discoveries and inventions - "We are only at the beginning of peacetime development. We are just beginning to use the new materials, new manufacturing techniques and new equipment discovered during the war to manufacture new products. Just the wartime development of atomic energy alone can revolutionize our country's economic life in a few short years."</p>

<p>Yesterday's game between China Aviation and Zhichao met at Yiyuan Stadium at 4 p.m. The sun was scorching, and the audience was sparse, about five or six hundred people. The referee was Zhang Zhiren, and the linesmen were Li Guoyi and Chen Daohong.</p>
<p>Zhichao kicked off the attack, but was blocked. China Aviation launched frequent attacks. Yin Qingbing took the ball forward and shot hard at the upper right corner from the 20-yard mark, breaking the deadlock first. Xu Zuguo added fuel to the fire, approaching the goal and shooting. Gan Huizhong扑出, the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. Gan happened to reach back and catch it. Zhichao tried hard to counterattack. Xu Guoping sent the ball to the front of the goal. Sheng Peter's shot was unsuccessful. Wu Zhemin launched a cold shot, but it also went out of bounds. Zhou Xing was injured and left the field, and Gu Erlu replaced him. After many encounters, Yin Qingbing got a pass from Gao Xiuqing and broke in again, scoring with a low shot, making it 2-0. China Aviation was in high spirits. Yin Qingbing passed to the left, and Xu Zuguo caught up and shot, opening the Zhichao goal again. The first half ended with 3-0.</p>
<p>After the break, the two sides fought again. China Aviation's original lineup remained unchanged. Zhichao's Wu Qixiang opened the front line and took the lead. Sure enough, his power was doubled. Guan Chengchang launched an uprising on the periphery and moved towards the center. Wu Qixiang headed the ball in, breaking the net and pulling back a city. China Aviation retreated to defend and tried hard to defend. Neither side achieved anything. In the 41st minute, Zhichao continued to attack. Wu Zhemin passed to Guan Chengchang, and he shot diagonally into the net, trailing by one goal. However, time was tight, and although the generals of Zhichao tried hard, it was too late. Finally, Gao Xiuqing shot into the goal from the 20-yard mark. As a result, China Aviation won against Zhichao by 4-2.</p>

<h3>Haiguang Table Tennis Overwhelms You Si; Seven More B Group Games Today</h3>
<p>In the fourth Table Tennis League, Haiguang faced off against You Si in Group B1 the day before yesterday. You Si's Zeng Yunjie showed his brilliance in six matches. Unfortunately, he encountered the deadly hands of Lingyun and Shanbao one after another last week, shaking his hopes of being selected. However, if he can remain undefeated afterwards, there is still a glimmer of hope. Haiguang is a strong team in the Silver Money Cup and the incarnation of the Shanghai Bank team. Its strength is very strong. It has played three times, winning two and losing one. This match against You Si is crucial to the future of both sides, so each sent its elite troops. The battle was fierce. Haiguang's Lu Jixing and Yang Yongkang were exceptionally brave, easily winning Groups 1 and 3 and leading all the way. You Si was at a disadvantage, relying on Yu Haishan and He Zhongzhi's desperate pursuit to win back Cities 2 and 4, tying the score at 2-2. The last group was the key to the final victory. You Si sent its main general Dai Lingchu on the stage. Haiguang originally listed two names as Yang Xixian and Ling Kecheng. Then, the team leader Lu Jixing had a flash of inspiration and ordered Ling Kecheng to meet the enemy. Ling is a draw, and his strength is abundant. The opponent Dai Ling considers himself good at guarding the ball, especially short blocks. Xiao Ling attacked with all his strength, and was exceptionally successful.

The fee is a uniform 5.6 million Gold Yuan per metric ton, regardless of the type of goods, which not only increases the burden on merchants but also hinders the transportation of export goods.

<h3>Opening of Trial for Seven Defendants in Yinfeng Woolen Mill Theft Case</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Jiang Lunzhang, Jiang Chuanxi, Wang Yongsheng, and others, in collusion with Yu Huaxiang and Zhang Hong, who are still at large, broke into the Yinfeng Woolen Mill at 1166 Guibei Road at approximately 1:00 AM on April 11th of this year by digging a hole in the wall. They stole 61 pieces of broadcloth, transported them to Jiang Lunzhang's manure boat, and took them elsewhere to divide the spoils. On the 13th of the same month, Jiang and the other two hired a boat to transport their share of the stolen goods to Suzhou. They were discovered and arrested by the police. Yu, on the 14th of the same month at approximately 11:00 AM, loaded the broadcloth onto a vehicle and drove to the Wuzhou Road small vegetable market, where he was stopped by police officers Bian Wenbao and Xu Dexiang. He then asked Zhu Lianxiu and Zhang Fujun to intercede on his behalf. They agreed to pay one tael of gold, 40 silver dollars, and one piece of serge. Since they did not have the cash, Zhu's wife, Wang, provided two gold rings, sold the broadcloth, and gave 40 silver dollars to Zhang, who passed it on to Bian and Xu. Yu then gave Zhu and Zhang each a piece of broadcloth as a reward. After the police discovered the crime, recovered the stolen goods, and sent them to the District Procuratorate for investigation, they have now charged Jiang and the other two with theft, Zhu and Zhang with bribery, and Bian and Xu with corruption.

<h3>Sluggish Cotton Yarn Trading, Cloth Market Continues Downtrend, National Bank Purchases Cotton Yarn Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn trading is sluggish, with most stalls only quoting prices. Recently, factories have been unable to cope with current financial difficulties and are eager to sell. However, because prices of financial commodities outside the circle continue to decline, the market first fell and then stabilized. 42-count Blue Phoenix closed at 1,020,000,000, up more than 90 million. 32-count Silver Moon 760,000,000, up 100 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse warehouse receipts were not traded, and there were no price quotes. Spot price was 660,000,000, up 60,000,000. All counts below 20 rose sharply.</p>
<p>The Central Bank directly purchased cotton yarn from manufacturers yesterday morning, and sellers were enthusiastic. The bank's quoted prices were 960,000,000 yuan for 42-count yarn, 840,000,000 yuan for 32-count Silver Moon, and 640,000,000 yuan for 20-count yarn. Manufacturers were willing to sell because the purchase prices were higher than market prices, especially for 32-count and 20-count yarn. Most of the yarn sold by manufacturers was of mixed brands. The difference between the market price and the purchase price for 32-count yarn was as much as 100 million, and the difference for 20-count yarn was 64.4 million.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market is continuing to decline. Merchants are particularly panicked and are rushing to sell. After the unofficial exchange rate of Yuan Yang occurred, although price quotes for Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi gabardine were very stable, their Gold Yuan value has risen sharply. At the morning opening, Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi gabardine were both trading at 15,600,000. Due to the soaring value of Gold Yuan notes, they once rose sharply together to 16,800,000, but near the close, profit-taking led them to close at 16,000,000. Longtou fine cloth remained flat compared to the previous day, while Sijunzi Yuan gabardine fell by another 400,000. Longtou B fine cloth traded at 14,800,000, also down 400,000. Wufu fine cloth rose slightly by 100,000, with the final transaction at 14,500,000. Santao fine cloth fell sharply by 1,000,000. Dasuanglong fine cloth closed at 14,000,000 in the afternoon.

<h3>Rice Prices Rise Sharply, Then Retreat Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market saw merchants become wary because the authorities are about to take severe measures against wholesale-priced rice merchants. Retailers were also less inclined to buy because this period's household ration rice is about to be issued, and market sentiment eased, with prices retreating slightly. In the northern market, Japonica thin paddy rice fell to 42,000,000 yuan, a drop of 2,000,000 yuan. The southern market also fell by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Early Indica rice and Japonica were both trading at 40,000,000 yuan, while thick Japonica was 41,000,000 to 41,500,000 yuan. Due to the rise in Gold Yuan notes outside the market, owners of rice flour were firm in maintaining their prices. Although retail buyers were eager, prices were too high, and most adopted a wait-and-see attitude, making it impossible to conduct transactions.</p>
<h3>Slack Trading in Miscellaneous Grains, Flour and Oil All Fall</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Trading was even more sluggish yesterday. Although owners were willing to sell, there were no buyers. Prices also rose due to the increase in gold and silver. Jiujiang winter soybeans were 21,000,000 yuan, up 5-6 million. Corn rose by 1.5 million. Sesame seeds and shelled peanuts all rose by 4-5 million. Sha Chi sorghum traded at 36,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the market suddenly turned weak, reversing the previous day's support. The market showed an oversupply, as hoarders sought to sell at low prices due to the tense situation. Bingchuan opened at 12,600,000 in the morning, but by the afternoon, it had fallen below 10 million, closing at 9,300,000. Lao Che retreated to 12,000,000. Wheat bran did not trade.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: The market took a sharp turn downward, with strong selling pressure and buyers adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Factory soybean oil opened at 138,000,000, but fell to 132,000,000 in the afternoon, a significant drop when compared to silver dollars. Raw oil fell by 20%. Factory opening price was 108,000,000. Raw rapeseed oil fell sharply by over 20,000, with spot prices closing at 102,000,000 in the afternoon, but it was still difficult to sell. Cooked rapeseed oil and sesame oil both fell. Soybean cake did not open.</p>

<h3>Factories Applying for Temporary Industrial Loans Should Be Allowed to Participate Equally, City Chamber of Commerce Submits Request to the Bureau of Social Affairs</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, urging that for factory loans, regardless of whether the applying factories are members of the Industrial Association or the Commercial Association, they should be allowed to participate equally in order to ensure fairness and avoid disputes. It stated: "This city's industrial sector is experiencing difficulty in paying wages in mid-month and has requested the National Bank to provide temporary loans. It has been decided to handle this in two ways: by purchasing finished products and by direct lending, and seven articles of temporary industrial loan measures have been drafted to carry out lending. However, the National Bank's current temporary industrial loans are still limited to factories belonging to the Industrial Association, which is unfair. The purpose of this operation is to alleviate the urgent mid-month wage payment difficulties of various manufacturers, but the business of producing daily necessities in this city is by no means limited to factories belonging to the Industrial Association. Many members of the Commercial Association also have factories that meet the loan qualifications. Due to the cessation of exports and weak domestic sales, they are equally unable to pay their employees' wages. The situation of manufacturers and workers who provide labor services should not be treated differently. In the past, China did not have the name "factory." All places where workers worked, regardless of their scale, were collectively referred to as "workshops." Later, with the development of production, the name "factory" came into being. However, whether they belong to commercial or industrial institutions, they are all factories with a large number of workers engaged in production, and the matter is the same. Therefore, all government measures to alleviate manufacturers' difficulties and safeguard workers' livelihoods should treat them equally, without discrimination. However, in the past, such things as the small industrial loans organized by the National Bank and the recent distribution of silver dollars to factories by the National Bank for wage payments, as well as the special rice allocation in the "Provisional Measures for Calculating Employee Salaries in This City" recently promulgated, are all specifically for member manufacturers of the Industrial Association, leaving workshops in commercial institutions out in the cold. This is not only unfair and unreasonable, but it also often leads to unnecessary disputes between labor and management. Workers who understand reason only lament that the government's handling of affairs is not entirely fair, while workers who do not understand reason may believe that since they are all workers, there should be no deliberate discrimination, and will say that the factory is eager to fight for it, or even suspect that it is deliberately playing tricks to profit from it. As a result, labor-management disputes have arisen repeatedly, and their plight is indescribable. Therefore, we are earnestly presenting the facts and requesting that you quickly forward this to the Central Bank, stating that for this temporary industrial loan, all factories, regardless of whether they have joined the Industrial Association or the Commercial Association, should be allowed to participate equally in order to ensure fairness and avoid disputes."</p>
<h3>Committee Passes Measures for Next-Day Deposits and Silver Dollar Distribution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The following measures for handling next-day deposit balances of various banks, bureaus, and commercial firms were passed yesterday at a meeting of the National Bank Appropriations Committee:</p>
<p>"Although the supply of banknotes by this bank has recently become more generous, it is still insufficient to meet actual needs. Therefore, in addition to providing as much cash as possible for the next-day deposit balances of various banks, bureaus, and commercial firms, it is still necessary to distribute fixed-amount promissory notes and silver coins. The total amount of deposits is greater than the amount deposited in this bank, and we have been unable to pay depositors in proportion to the number of silver coins issued by this bank. Outsiders are not aware of the truth and cannot avoid misunderstandings. In order to take both factors into account, the plan is to require all banks, bureaus, and commercial firms to report the total amount of deposits and the amount of silver coins in their vaults to this bank at the end of each business day, starting from today. When paying deposits the next day, the proportion of silver coins to be distributed should be based on the ratio of the total amount of deposits to the number of silver coins available from this bank on that day. Any amount less than one silver dollar should be paid in Gold Yuan notes, and it should be publicly announced outside the business counter so that everyone is aware."</p>

<h3>The Wellspring of Agricultural Production and the Engine of Economic Prosperity: Taiwan Cooperative Bank</h3>
<p>— Xin Shi</p>
<p>[Taipei News] The cooperative enterprises of this province already had a considerable foundation during the Japanese occupation. However, it only served as a tool for the empire's economic plunder and control, and a means to alleviate capital monopoly, which was completely different from the principle of equality in our economic system of people's livelihood. After the Retrocession, the provincial authorities established cooperative institutions and carried out a comprehensive reorganization. Over the past two years, through continuous efforts and smooth development, the foundation has gradually been consolidated. There are currently 527 cooperative societies with 720,000 members, spread throughout the province. In terms of business, the emphasis is on supporting the production of fisheries and agriculture, so that the sales of special products and the supply of raw materials can develop in a balanced manner. This achievement is due to the fact that the provincial authorities consider the prosperity of cooperative enterprises as the most important key to the province's society.</p>
<p>Reorganization Process</p>
<p>The cooperative financial institution before the Retrocession was called the Taiwan Industrial Association Federation, which was established in 1942. In 1943, it was renamed the Taiwan Industrial Bank, handling deposit, loan, and remittance businesses. After the Retrocession, it temporarily maintained its original state. It was not until October 1946 that the current Cooperative Bank was established, with a capital of NT$25 million. In addition to the NT$15 million subscribed by the provincial government and related agencies, the purpose was to promote the economic life of the people of this province, and the task was to regulate the capital of the cooperative enterprises in this province. It was by no means purely focused on profit-making, so it could practice the principle of joint ownership, joint operation, and joint sharing, and expand the scope of investment to provide the necessary funds for cooperative enterprises, so as to improve the social and economic life of cooperative members. Moreover, because it is essentially more stable and safe, in addition to regulating funds and promoting the development of cooperative enterprises, it can also achieve the effect of assisting the government in stabilizing the financial situation of the province's society.</p>
<p>Organizational Outline</p>
<p>The internal organization of the bank is quite large. The decision-making body is the Board of Directors, which is responsible for implementing the resolutions of the shareholders' meeting, determining business policies, and reviewing various regulations. A Board of Supervisors is also set up to be responsible for supervising the bank's financial situation and the execution of business operations. The Board of Directors has 11 directors, including 7 public directors and 4 private directors. The Board of Supervisors has 5 supervisors, including 3 public supervisors and 2 private supervisors. The head office has a general manager, two assistant managers, and five departments, including general affairs, accounting, cashier, auditing, and research, as well as two departments, including business and trust. In order to meet the needs of the society, branch institutions have been established in important areas, including six locations in Taipei, Hsinchu, Tainan, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and the Eastern region, as well as 55 agency units throughout the province. In February of last year, in order to handle business quickly, the Taipei branch was abolished, and its business was directly handled by the business department of the head office. In order to promote the rural economy of Taitung, the Eastern branch was changed to Hualien branch to handle Hualien business exclusively, and a Taitung branch was established separately in Taitung. Recently, branches are being planned in Chiayi, Changhua, Yilan and other places, and it is expected that they will open soon.</p>
<p>Current Business</p>
<p>Since the official establishment of the bank, thanks to the painstaking planning of the general manager and the joint efforts of the general staff, the business has been thriving. The main business can be roughly divided into six parts: deposits, loans, remittances, acting as a public treasury, distributing stamp tax tickets throughout the province, and acting as an agent for household sugar allocation. The details are as follows: (1) Deposits: The deposits absorbed by the bank are mostly rural funds. In the past, due to the need for funds in rural areas and the fact that the credit cooperative management regulations had not yet been announced, the number of deposits from various cooperative organizations could not reach the ideal level. However, after the bank's efforts to persuade them, the total number of deposits has increased month by month, and the increase has been even faster in recent years.</p>
<p>(2) Loans: The bank's lending targets are mainly cooperative organizations. In order to cooperate with the government's policy of stabilizing commodity prices, loans are mostly focused on rural production and fishery production. As long as the borrower's credit is obvious, the period is suitable, and the purpose is normal, the loan can be granted after review. The procedures are very simple and the interest rate is very low, so the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic in recent years.</p>
<p>(3) Remittance Business: The bank has widely established agency offices throughout the province. In order to facilitate financial circulation, it started remittance and collection services in January of the year before last. The procedures are simple, the fees are low, and it is not limited to cooperative organizations. Individuals can also entrust remittances and collections. Since its opening, due to the obvious social credit and the rapid remittance procedures, the people of the province have praised it as convenient, so the remittance business has become very developed.</p>
<p>(4) Acting as a Public Treasury: The public treasury of this province is managed by the Bank of Taiwan, but the Bank of Taiwan entrusts the bank to act as an agent in places where it does not have branch institutions, and is responsible for collecting and resolving the funds required by various agencies and various income. Currently, there are 93 units acting as public treasuries, including Taoyuan.</p>
<p>(5) Distributing Stamp Tax Tickets Throughout the Province: The bank is entrusted by the Provincial Department of Finance to sell stamp tax tickets throughout the province, and designates each contributing cooperative as a distribution point, and also establishes retail points in key areas. Currently, there are more than 400 distribution points, spread throughout the remote areas of the province, which is of great benefit to the national treasury revenue.</p>
<p>(6) Acting as an Agent for Household Sugar Allocation: In July 1947, the bank was ordered by the Provincial Government to handle the allocation of household sugar throughout the province, with each period being two months. Each person can receive half a kilogram of sugar per period. The number of people receiving the allocation per period is more than 6.5 million. The selling price is lower than the market price, and the allocation is meticulous, so the people of the province benefit greatly.</p>
<p>In addition, in terms of agency business, the bank has also handled the follow-up relief fertilizer款, which is collected and transferred to the Bank of Taiwan by the bank, as well as the payment for the purchase of tobacco leaves by the Tobacco Leaf Company, which is paid by the Taichung and Hualien branches of the bank. It also handles trust business.</p>
<p>Future Plans</p>
<p>In order to review the past and plan for the future, the bank also intends to make the following improvements to the future business policy: (1) Establish more branches and strengthen the business of agency offices: The province is vast, and it is still difficult to penetrate into the people and provide universal services. Therefore, it is specially planned to establish several more branches in important areas, and after the establishment of more branches, adjust, allocate, supervise, and manage the agency offices that are entrusted to handle the nature of the business, so as to facilitate the promotion of business. (2) Absorb as much deposits as possible and simplify procedures: There is abundant floating capital in this province recently, and commodity prices are fluctuating. In order to assist the government in stabilizing finance, the bank intends to order various branches to absorb as much deposits as possible from cooperative organizations, and use these deposits as agricultural production funds for lending, so as to guide floating capital into production enterprises and stabilize finance. As for the loan procedures, we will also strive to make them simple and quick, and extend the loan period as appropriate according to the nature of the loan, so as to achieve the effect of increasing production. (3) Strengthen trust business: The total number of cooperative members in this province is more than 700,000. In order to avoid the intermediate exploitation of merchants, the procurement and supply of daily necessities for members, and the consignment and sales of members' products, we will coordinate with various federations and strive to serve them in the future, so as to reduce the burden on members and stabilize general commodity prices.</p>
<p>This is the source of agricultural production in this province, and at the same time, it is the artery that stabilizes the economy and prospers the local area.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia: An Appendix</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhen Jun</p>
<p>Discriminated against by Tito, and even encountering resistance due to Tito, just when the Soviet Union was smoothly conducting negotiations on the Austrian peace treaty, Tito put forward Yugoslavia's demands for Galicia, making the whole problem chaotic and difficult to reach a consensus. Regarding the issue of demanding the return of the entire port to the South, because of Stalin's ambition and attempt to intervene, he was greatly troubled and wanted to embarrass him in front of the Four Powers. Later, Tito lobbied Bulgaria and Greece, all of which showed that Tito did not pay much attention to Moscow's instructions in terms of pace and time, and acted directly and automatically. Tito's Balkan plan was to unite the Balkan countries with Yugoslavia as the center and form the Balkan Alliance. The motivation for this approach was mainly to guard against Soviet encroachment on the South. However, this is clearly contrary to Stalin's ultimate goal of encompassing the entire Balkans and joining the Soviet Union as one of the Soviet republics.</p>
<p>Stalin's plan in the Balkans was to first unite Yugoslavia and Bulgaria and combine them into a</p>
<p>Southern Slavic race A great alliance, and listen to the leadership of Moscow. Then, the next step was to implement the policy of controlling Tito, and at the same time strengthen the party's organization and strength. Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgi Dimitrov said that he would act alone and accept the plan of Chairman Stalin, if that was feasible. But Tito refused, and this unpleasant statement suddenly rigidified the whole situation, and an open friction occurred between Stalin and Tito.</p>
<p>Tito has his own independent thoughts and consciousness. He believes that, except in the Soviet Union itself, Stalin's words are not necessarily law, so other satellite countries can naturally take independent actions. This statement, in Stalin's ears, is clearly a contemptuous insult. Communists in other European countries do not have the courage to say such things publicly, and even if they accidentally hear it, they must hurry away quietly.</p>
<p>The basis for Tito's gambling action is that he clearly sees that, in Stalin's current situation, he will not rashly send powerful military forces to subvert his existing position. At the same time, the masses who support him still have confidence in him, and will increasingly resist any weaker attacks from outside.</p>
<p>Stalin's victory has been greatly discounted by Tito. When the Soviet Union takes any military action to warn other vassal states, it may arouse strong resentment. Therefore, it is better to destroy the abstract thematic concepts of each vassal state, that is, to intervene by means of economic recovery, which is more appropriate and reliable. This situation is now spreading throughout the Soviet Union. Tito's biggest bet is the broad support force in Yugoslavia. The former Chief of Staff of Yugoslavia, who was greatly favored by Stalin and far superior to Tito himself, was killed immediately when he tried to flee the country. The support Tito can get in the country will certainly not be 100% satisfactory, but he is prepared to take the toughest measures against his opposition party.</p>
<p>The leaders of the communist parties in each province have now been purged. Two cabinet members who disagreed were also asked to leave. Under Tito's control, there is a well-trained secret police force, and most of the troops are loyal to him. The people of Yugoslavia will naturally not welcome dictatorship, but they would rather have a ruler who has all the power in Belgrade than have this figure live in distant Moscow.</p>
<p>Tito's all-or-nothing adventure has been carefully considered, and this retaliatory opportunity often exists. Those</p>
<p>Kremlin agents can successfully give him a head-on blow, so that he can never get up again. Yugoslavia naturally has economic difficulties, and it is likely to form a greater danger, requiring external assistance. Some people have also speculated that Stalin will give Yugoslavia greater pressure, so that they will turn against Tito.</p>
<p>In fact, the Soviet offensive has already begun. Those kerosene supplies from Romania have now been cut off. Moscow's political workers secretly infiltrated the South to create difficulties for Tito. At the same time, those nerve wars directly manipulated by Moscow, from every corner of the Soviet empire, have now been placed in front of Tito. But on the other hand, Stalin's failure to liquidate Tito may also have its own value.</p>
<p>The spread of Titoism's independent thinking stayed in Stalin's mind.</p>
<p>Worrisome Big Problem Bulgaria's Dimitrov's tendency is frustrating, because his loyalty to Moscow falls behind the ideal. Czech Prime Minister Klement Gottwald also seems unable to make all the Czech people wholeheartedly support Stalin. The leaders of the Polish Communist Party are also slow to gather the farmers in each village and reluctantly obey Stalin's orders. Therefore, if Tito is let go lightly without punishment, then the other vassal states that the Kremlin can control may be greatly infected and become a crisis.</p>
<p>At the same time, due to the rift between Stalin and Tito, and the possibility of a complete seam is unlikely for a while, this will be a rare opportunity for Western European countries. The good opportunity that this rift gives to Western European countries is that they will use the ready-made materials and put a lot of effort into business and propaganda to deal with Stalin. In addition, there may be more exciting good shows later. Therefore, for his own benefit, Stalin must take action to punish Yugoslavia. Recently, he will not have much spare mood to cause too much conflict with other countries until he has completely blocked this loophole. (Translated from World Report Magazine)</p>
<h3>Jinshan Enters Wartime Phase: Tight Defense Arrangements</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Jinshan, 10th] Since the retreat of our troops from Jiaxing, troop movements here have been frequent, and the people's hearts have become more tense. Recently, the buses and ships from Jinshan to Songjiang and from Zhujing to Fengjing have been closed for many days, and there are very few merchants coming and going. The market is in a slump, and silver shops, rice shops, restaurants, and taverns have also closed down one after another. Only small shops and vendors are still operating as usual, but they all feel that it is not easy to replenish the goods they sell. The bosses sigh with sorrow all day long!</p>
<p>The current Jinshan has entered a wartime phase. The county security team is now closely cooperating with the national army to closely deploy defenses. The police organs maintain order day and night. County Magistrate Wang, Regiment Leader Zhang, Bureau Chief Sun, etc. are all sitting in the urban area to command and ensure the current security of the streets.</p>
