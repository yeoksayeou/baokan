<h3>黨務工作講習會　閻錫山演詞全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿一日電〕中央黨部主辦之黨務工作幹部講習會，廿日下午四時假中央黨部會議廳，請太原綏署主任閻伯川先生講話，到一百餘人，語皆肯要，博得不斷掌聲，至五時許散會，茲誌閻氏演詞全文如次：</p>
<p>諸位同志均係多年從事地方工作，一定有宏富之經驗，鄙人實無可貢獻意見之餘地，惟即蒙不棄，聊述愚見，以供參考。</p>
<p>本黨負治國之責，應從治道治術上研究共同的目標，一致認識，一致行動。就治道上說，必須理力并重，國際間無最高之裁判，實際是理力不分，理想力伸力憑理的，無理之力必析，無力之理不伸，故立國必須培力講理，這培力講理就是治道，講理不只是對外，對內更要緊，如惟力是視，不管該不該，只管能不能，能則為之，是咸為無理之力，無論對內對外終必失敗，培力講理的目標是治道，如何培力講理就是治術，治術要主觀的施為合乎客觀的需要，如同鐘錶之時針轉動，必須合乎地球的自轉，如不合即成廢轉之鐘錶，治術，亦必須政治本身之所施為合乎人民之所需要。</p>
<p>政治設施的前提，必須合乎環境需求，不可冬葛而夏裘，要人民出錢出力，必須適合人民之需要及其經濟力，若富者避其出力，更避其出錢，而貧者出力更出錢，無論如何重要的事，人民也可能反抗，治術就是使政治與環境和客觀統一的設施。</p>
<p>本黨講求治術多年，諸君做地方工作，尤重以治術完成治道力量全憑創造能力而發展，所謂創造就是適合乎本身與環境適時之種種設施，其次是摹仿能力，摹仿必須摹仿的適當，無摹仿能力的國家，固然是等於愚昧，若摹仿的不適當，亦等於瘋癲，世之譏不善摹仿者，喻云：「見腿瘓而斷腿以保命，瘋癲之摹仿者無腿疾如亦斷腿」，以算其時麾，此瘋癲之摹仿，較不善摹仿之愚昧反遜一籌。</p>
<p>本黨當國以來，很表現了許多創造性的設施，本黨同志更應繼續增進我們的創造能力，來適應環境，培植我們的力量，挽救我們的危亡，諸同志負接近民眾的工作，實為承上領下之樞紐，本立國之重要與民眾之所需，連系工作，　到政治深入民間，使人民的力量表現在生存奮門上，實為負地互責任之諸同志當前唯一之任務。</p>
<p>此外，吾國今日各種新名詞，多直接來自歐美，或間接來自日本，其含義與本國意義多有出入，解釋定義各有不同，譬如實現民主自由，即為今日最有力之目標，民主究竟是主什麼？如何主？尤在實現的過程中，如何培植民主，誘導民主，保育民主方能使民主順利的進行，若在過程中沒有適當的辦法，則目標上是求民主之治，事實上反得勾民主之亂，作戰時期人民要求廢征兵征糧征稅，而作戰之需兵需款需糧，至為明顯，要求廢除征兵征稅征糧，即等於要求停止作戰，民國九年，臺灣的一位同胞向我說，臺灣每人平均年負担四十元，問我山西人民平均負担若干，我答平均每人負担四元，他說我從上海·北平到太原途中，人人均說山西的負担重，這較臺灣人民的負担才是十分之一，我說你是不是回祖國平可以減輕你的負担，他鄭重的說：減輕負担，不是幸福，今日世界上無論是強盛的國家或是衰亡的國家，均須每人負重大的負担，強國是以人民的負担自存與征服他國，亡國的人民亦　挑上負担，供給征服的國家，可痛心的是亡國的人民負担上重，說連上中學的權利都沒有，我們祖國有以主張廢除苛捐雜稅為自矝者，在我國的認識上，苛捐雜稅，是頂讓廢除，惟什麼叫苛，什麼叫雜，應當推求，我們若認識的不當，廢除了苛捐雜稅，卽是廢除了當強文明國防建設，社會建設，安定國家，保障民生，均係人民負担，不過是負担的公理公平負担的，必須用到富強文明上，負担慎重，慎安寗，慎發達，但人民亦以為安寗發達在後，且是大家的需要，眼前負担是個人的，此種矛盾的收理，實是振興國家的一個最大的雜圖，若以少負担而為徙固本人認為還欠考慮，鄙人當時聽了此話，頓覺言之冒然，甚感慚愧，再如說自由是一個人，一個民族幸福的標號，但有應用之適當，亦應有適當之解釋與範圍，「不自由毌寗死」是指範圍以內的自由，自由，天下多少罪惡假汝之名以行據範圍以外的自由，若因自由不敢講秩序約律，則自由可以衝破了共同生活的幸福，阻礙了人類的進步，撕毀了人類的安寗，諸同志領導鄕間工作，必須正確解釋自由的意義與自由的範圍，納民眾之行動於自由之軌道中。</p>
<p>我們今日的失敗，外人多批評我們貪污，例如軍隊紀律一好，政治效果不大，我們應謙虛的接受，應自極力承認改善，但鄙人所見，即使以上各點完全改善，亦不能抵抗敵人，因敵人所用的戰略，係民眾性的政治戰，他以沒收廣大人民之財產，收買他所謂之民眾領導，再用恐怖手段，在一地方，凡只是清除了他反對者，以恐怖和急取，把中立的人完全變成了與他同利害，同存亡的團力，他封鎖了他的軍情和一切，使我們成了瞎子，他遍地位置了謊報員，展開了他的合理，看他自誇的如同鄕人賭博，他長上了穿通眼，看來天明當然是法是百磁，我們與敵作戰，敵軍的一切一切我們皆不知，我們的一切一切敵皆明瞭，我打敵人，我多數避去，敵人打我，以實擊虛，比上海戰若以舟碰舟，強者勝之，敵人的民眾性政治戰，是以水覆舟，舟不能勝水，舟終失敗，我們今日必須改變政略，改變戰略，必須組織民眾，組織民眾之工作，全在負地方責任諸同志之努力，在以民眾作門爭的今天，經過了激烈門爭與熱烈的競賽，組織日眾，則方術已成科學化，欲組織鄕鎮，必須先組織保甲，欲組織保甲，必須先組織家戶，欲組織家戶，必須先行調查每一家戶中每一個人生活經歷，受過什麼痛苦，尤其注意受過我們敵人的什麼痛苦，調查清楚後，即實行家戶訪問，此為第一步。</p>
<p>訪問時，針對被訪問者之個別痛苦作為爭取之門徑，亦即本此痛苦，揭以社會之罪惡與敵人之殘暴，啟發其個人之憐心，并要使他感到勻人間唯一來愛他的，救他的，甚至於陪上眼淚，表示同情，此是第二步。</p>
<p>然後，再就他全家庭內之各侗人，分別作在生活經歷中經成的頭腦及他個人環境上關係，人的經歷成分，如他家裏媳婦，一定要考查婦家的家世，與各人人的生活思想，如他家裏的閨女，一定要考查他婆家的家世與各個人人生活思想，估計到能否爭取，如不能爭取，如何安慰防範，如能爭取，用何方法爭取，是一個人爭取，或數人爭取，若干次爭取，此為第三次。通常的經騐，十次的懇談能組織易組織的人，百次的懇談組織不起的人，是終久不易爭取的。同樣十次的懇談，一人十次的懇談，不如兩人三人的效果大，長坐的懇談不如協助人工作的懇談效果大。懇談通常為先鬆，中緊，後長。先鬆如兩三日談一次，中緊是一天談一次，或一天談兩三次，後長就是一個月以後，長久繼續的每星期必須談一次，以上懇談時間要短，話要中肯，以免惹起人民的厭煩，如他自身特別的情形或特殊困難的發生，立刻懇談，該安慰的酌予安慰，該偵察的從旁偵察，均須注意本人及其他人的反應，此為第四步。</p>
<p>懇談的目的不在單純有瞭解，而是要作到瞭解後的組織，看家庭的人口多少，組織成功二人或三人的家庭小組，尤其要注重兒童，因兒童熱烈而率真，此為第五步。</p>
<p>組織易，領導難，組織起來以後必須施以緊密的，進步的，經常的領導，在領導的方式上，并且要使人不感覺是領導，而是照護，此為第六步。</p>
<p>如比組織起家庭小組，以後　再組織保甲，須有一個三人至五人的工作小組，此外組的領導人必須熱心，勤懇，謙和，能深入民眾的家庭，不脫離開民眾，一保亦必須一，三人至五人的工作領導小組，此小組的負責人頂好經過短期訓練，必須使他對整個目標認識一致，工作上行動一致，使他有較高的政治水準與領導能力，以政治方式配合上人民的生活條件，領導其保幹部并佈置全保工作，鄕鎮必須有五人至七人的領導小組，此小組的負責人必須經過省的集體訓練，文化水準與政治水準并重，文化水準能以文字表達意思為標準，政治水準必須具在粉碎敵人的政治攻勢，以自己政治攻勢反擊敵人政治陰謀的智能，能領導佈置全鄕鎮幹部工作，并能熱誠的鼓勵全鄕鎮的人民對我政治的向心，此為第七步。</p>
<p>如能完成此項組織民眾工作，則可以醫治好我們雙瞎子，摘去敵人的千里眼，并使敵人完成了雙瞎子，使敵人散開，我們把他打死，團結起來，把他們困死，我們避實擊虛，以大吃小，日日壯大，軍事方有辦法。</p>
<p>諸同志對組織工作向有研究，且多經經驗，鄙人以上所說僅就愚見所得，聊供參考。</p>

<h3>訪問江東戰場</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自從保衛大上海戰事由月浦劉行之綫移至浦東，全上海六百萬市民，已俱以最關切情注視其發展，記者為求了解該方面戰事之實際清形，廿二日晨特冒雨再作浦東訪問。</p>
<p>就整個滬戰態勢看，浦東應該是一個最無關輕重的戰場，過去一二八時如此，八一三時亦如此。原因是像浦東這樣一個狹長地帶，假使敵對方面把重兵安排在這樣一個地形裏，是「兵家所大忌」，是容易被對手方面由莘莊閔行經奉賢東下至海邊，遮斷其後方補給綫，并進而全部包圍殲滅的。但是今天共軍為什麼這樣做？當然，我們不能為了陳毅是文人出身對於大的兵略原則了解得不够，不過，這至少是軍事上一種最大的冒險是無可置疑的</p>
<p>原來陳毅的最初作戰計劃是以請銳之師突擊獅子林·月浦·楊行·劉行之綫，企圖於十五日前佔領吳淞口，控制黃浦江，遮斷大上海的水上交通，然後以「神經攻勢」壓迫國軍「局部和平」，初未料經長勝軍劉玉章部的迎頭痛擊，共軍的此項計劃全被粉碎，而在共軍則勉強的在滬戰剛　發的頭四天中，佔領了奉賢，南匯及川沙，因此，陳毅便變更作戰計劃，只要佔領整個浦東，愷非可與佔領吳淞口，獲得在軍事上的同樣戰果？</p>
<p>原業用在浦東的陳毅正規軍，僅卅軍一個軍，但他為了遂行上項計劃，連日來便不斷在浦東增兵，據軍方所獲材料，現在已經發現的番號即有第卅·卅一·卅二·卅三·廿·廿一及卅五等七個軍，因此，自十七日起原來共軍在浦東係助攻的，現在則改為主攻，原來係支戰場的現在則一變而為主戰場了</p>
<p>滬戰最高統帥的湯老總，為了針對此項戰事上的新情勢，粉碎陳毅的此項軍事冒險，除增派重兵接防浦東，加強該方面兵力外，并特調　抗戰期間遠征印緬的名將闕漢騫軍長為某某兵圖司令官，負責指揮該方面戰事。</p>
<p>闕司令官和記者也是老友，我們雖已多年未見，俱其風趣仍不改當年，他是湖南人，但他魁偉的身材，不相識的必認係典型的北方人，因此星相家都說他「南人北相」，故主貴，其實他不僅身材像北方人，就是個性，也完全是北方人的性格。這次我們見面後，他自然感得特別高興，他為我們講了許多關於山東，河北等地共軍「解放軍」裏的故事。他說：高橋迄在國軍固守中，國軍的前進陣地在高橋南約三四里張家宅，楊家宅，陸家宅之綫。共軍五日來雖不斷進攻，但其結果，只是卅軍的全軍覆沒，最近源源增調生力軍，於十八日雖一度進佔東溝以北之桂家宅，但仍未能絲毫動搖我之主陣地。</p>
<p>目下東溝以南國軍所據守的係北自慶寗寺經農家木廠，洋涇中學，浦東中學至周家渡等附近之綫，該區國軍兵力亦甚優厚。</p>
<p>據某兵團沈參謀處長誠告訴我：在本月十八日下午一時左右，闕司令官曾新赴第一綫指揮，山於當面共軍正自東溝北桂家宅向市輪渡方面猛衝，闕司令官乃指揮戰車協同步兵全力堵擊，當他乘着吉普車剛下車兩秒鐘後，他的吉普左面玻璃即中一機關槍彈，玻璃粉碎成一大窟窿，但闕若無其事，繼續督戰，敵卒後退，陣地因之穩住，其勇毅沉着有如是者，記者這次前往時，還看到那輛被擊破玻璃的吉普正放在他的司令部裏。</p>
<p>記者在他的司令部裏，又訪問了許多俘虜，其中大部是山東人，一部是筆蚌會戰被俘的國軍經訓練後又被送來前綫的，他們滿身汚泥，據他們講，都已三晝夜在充滿雨水的戰壕裏未進粒米，他們的待遇，還是每月一斤豬肉的市價折發人民券。</p>
<p>在記者停留在前綫六小時中，顯得異常沉寂，旣無槍擊，亦無砲聲，據闕司令官說：今天他們正在換防，由於昨晚打了一夜犧牲了不少。因此，我們都得以最輕鬆的心情，欣賞闕司令官由煙臺作戰時帶回來的已存有四十四年的張裕美酒白蘭地，原來前年十月一日國軍收復煙臺時，最先進入煙臺市的，正是他所指揮的某某軍。</p>

<h3>社論　救濟難民　救護傷亡</h3>
<p>無情的戰火已燃燒到了上海的四郊，所有江灣，大場，吳淞，新市，真如，北新涇，高橋，洋涇，斯盛，龍華，虹橋等郊區，都已或將淪為戰場，以致一般市民紛紛向市區搬移，成為流離失所衣食無着的難民。本市社會局為了救濟四郊受難的居民，雖已籌發食米千石，并在各地尋覓房屋予收容；但是救濟難民的工作，僅由社會局少數人去辦理，不論在人力方面或在物力方面，都要感到不敷分配的：因此，我們不得不希望社會慈善團體，均能站在人道主義的立場，出來協助社會担負起这件艰鉅的工作。</p>
<p>據報載稱，中國紅十字會，紅卍字會，羅馬大主教會，基督教會，中國青年會，兒童福利會，佛教會，仁濟堂，曁其他各種慈善團體，回鄕會，公益團體等，業已發起組織一個「上海市聯合救濟委員會」，并由上海名流顏惠慶，本思浩，黃涵芝，簽延芳等人士主持其事，以過去上海救濟事業　情形而論，這個「聯合救濟機構」必能寫整千整萬的難民謀福利，更必能為上海六百萬市民所信任，在執行其救濟難民的任務的過程，不論有何需求，市民終必能踴躍輪將，真正做到「有錢出錢，有力出力」。</p>
<p>上海是一個工商都市，上海市民的傳統精神，一言以蔽之，在於一個「義」字，不論在社會的任何階層，都能充分認識「互助」「合作」的真諦，最流行的一句俗話，「窮靠富，富靠窮」之前含有無限的意義。近十五年來，上海迭遭危難，一九三二年的一·一八淞滬之役，一九三七年　八·一三上海之戰，一九四一年的一二·八太平洋戰爭。每次暴風的襲來，均曾使上海市民出生入死，幸賴上海市民均有風雨同舟的精神，深明「互助」「合作」的大義，終使上海轉危為安，化險為夷。別的不必說，僅以救濟難民一項而論，組織的嚴密，範圍的龐大，收容人數的眾多，以及救難兼及教育，都是任何都市所不能及的。這是上海市民的傳統精神的表現，也是上海市民的光榮紀錄。這次不幸遭遇戰災，性質雖然和過去不同；但是站在人道主義的立場，努力救濟難民，仍應該一樣的，因此，我們對於救濟難民的工作，願提出下列幾點意見。</p>
<p>第一，救濟難民是上海六百萬市民的神聖事業，人人有責，不分男女，不論窮富，都要盡他市民一份子的義務。換句話說，我們希望上海六百萬市民確能做到「有錢出錢，有力出力」的地步。經費的籌募是富有市民的責任，救濟工作的展開，當有賴一般市民的熱心服務。</p>
<p>第二，戰火益迫市區，流彈的竄人，以及其他不幸事件的發生，都是勢所難免的；因此，我們所謂的救濟工作，降了救濟四郊的無家可歸的難民而外，還要担負起救護受傷市民的工作。這是有關醫藥服務的工作，使我們對於本市的醫師，護士曁各大醫院，不能不希望他們多盡一些力量。</p>
<p>第三，上海是個國際都市，在今日的廣大難民群之中，固不乏世界各國的人士，就是將來遭遇傷亡的不幸者之中。自然也有各國的僑民在內：因此，我們對於在國際上素負聲譽的世界紅十字會，也應該挺身而出，參加工作，救濟上海的難民，救護上海不幸傷亡的人民。</p>
<p>要之，為善最樂，平時救苦救難，已是人類最高尚最神聖的美德，何況在此戰火迫近危難之際，捨已為群，以自己多餘的物力人力救助他人，更為今日上海人民人人所樂為。我們希望上海六百萬市民都能參加這個救濟難民。救護傷亡的偉大工作。</p>

<h3>北平和平真象</h3>
<p>續廿一日四版</p>
<p>根據新華社的報導，認為兩次慶祝大會是北平人狂歡的代表，但設問稍為客觀的一點人，他必告訴你北平人的狂歡是在一月一日，而非二月三日，尤其不是十二日，所謂歡迎云云，慶祝云云，那不過是其黨的自拉自唱罷了。</p>
<p>（八）原來如此</p>
<p>自北平易手之後，因連年的內憂外患，加以一部份官吏的貪污無能，政府招人不滿意的地方太多了，一切設施確難滿足人的慾望，人們永遠容易把希望寄託在另外的一個世界裏，尤其是一個不容易看到的世界，很多人氫那裏幻想成一個完美無缺的天堂，再加以傳道師很巧妙的宣傳，更令人心嚮往之了，及果真到了這個天堂，見所謂天堂也者原來如此，有幸運能到天堂的小姐們，又要唱「仙女思凡」。</p>
<p>北平在局部和平未實行前，很多人把和平實現後幻想得很如意，及和平實現後，竟發現了一連三的原來如此，茲簡述如下：</p>
<p>（一）倡導和平的人士，他們的理想，在和平之後，第一步要成立聯合機構，就等於聯合政府，這個聯合政府，就是華北最高權力機關，其中委員，最初雖然是國三共四，但共黨即以民主自由來號召，將來當然要擴大基礎，歡迎各黨各派去參加，所以和約簽訂之初，盛傳×××已積極在組織民主自由黨，準備參加聯合政府，又雖知聯合機構成立之後，無聲無臭的在中南海一帶毫無半點作用，人家的行政系統，最高是中國共產黨，一黨代行中央政府職權，下而有華北·東北·西北·華東·中原·瓊崖六「解放區」，每區設一人民政府，華北「解放區」人民政府主席是董必武，委員全是共黨，不僅不準各黨各派參加，還要解散國民黨，民社黨，青年黨，及一切反動黨派和團體，并逮捕所謂反動份子。共黨的應聲虫國民黨革命委會，在接收了西四北外街張億瑾的房子之後，就掛牌子公開活動了，誰知沒過三天，牌子被摘，房子被警備局令部佔去了，應聲虫如此，其他黨派可知。不準參加政權，已經出人意料，最令人詫異的，是倡導和平最早的張蔭梧，被指為軍統而捕去，奔走和平最力的許惠東，呼為七五禍首而拘押，敲開和平之門的何思源，被稱為和平掮客，而今在家學習民主，過河拆橋，兎死狗烹，保不思源之甚耶。在和約簽訂之後，於一月卅一日，還有一架飛機飛綏遠，舊歷元旦，我給惠東去拜年，我普曾敦勸他飛走，他當時振振有辭，認為七五事件第一：議案即令不對，但那是丁春安提的，他即未連署，又未參加表決，與他何干；第二：學生包圍他住宅，要打他，他怕挨打而逃了，這總不算罪過；第三：開槍事姑不論是誰放的第一槍，但軍有陳繼承，警有楊清值，推一百人也推不到他負責，且他奔走和平最力，人所共曉，共黨再不講理，也不會損害到他，誰知曾幾何時，就在上海和平四老到平那天，共黨已發動學生在追捕他了，最可笑的是因惠東行六，熟人就呼之為六哥，喊他獨一無二的基本太太作六嫂，但人民日報則硬指我們這位老得快掉牙的六嫂為他的六姨太太，真不知這又有什麼意思。</p>
<p>張蔭梧提倡顏李哲學，創辦四存學校，該校平時軍事訓練，抗戰時曾打游擊，學校有槍，眾所共曉，誰知共黨不念他倡導和平最早之勞，竟以有槍作口實，硬指他為正統而埔去，天曉得，凡有政治常識的人，誰也不會相信張蔭梧是軍統，我想共黨自己也不會相仿他自己的話，但竟以虛名義而捕去，寃哉。</p>
<p>何思源奔走和平之情，前已詳述，共軍入城後，就銷聲匿跡，隱居養傷，起初只知人民日報對他冷譏熱嘲，說他與甘介侯同是李宗仁的和平掮客，後來新民報上登出來了，說當局正送他多少馬列主義的書，正令他閉門思過，學習民主，下落有了，原來頓禁在家在。（未完）</p>

<h3>掃却冷戰·樹立世界和平　四強外長會今揭幕</h3>
<p>英美法立場經密談後已獲致完全協議　維辛斯基由蘇京飛抵巴黎</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕戰後歐洲最重要的會議，將於星期一晨在此揭幕。德國甚至世界和平的命運，可能繫於此一會議的收穫。英美法三國外長於廿二日晨又舉行一次外長會議揭幕前的末次秘密會議，以檢討西方三強在本屆外長會中的立場。英大使館員今日透露，貝文·艾契遜·許曼三位外長今晨在法國外交部內秘密談兩小時之久，已就三國在外長會議中所採取之立場獲致完全協議。莫斯科今日下午傳來的消息，顯示蘇外長維辛斯基於昨日抵達巴黎後，仍繼續與駐德蘇軍統帥邱可夫將軍保持接觸，隨時聆取柏林及德國局勢的發展。一般預料維辛斯基在本屆外長會議中雖將有若干讓步，但同時亦將明確表示蘇聯最後的立場，逾此不容再有變更。今日巴黎充滿了緊張期待的空氣，巴黎報紙對於維辛斯基作熱烈的歡迎，將維氏抵巴黎時之照片，置於首頁顯著地位。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿一日電〕四國外長會議將於星期一下午四時在巴黎之大理石宮召開。此間人士默認英美法三外長在今夜之預備會議中，已對外長會議開會時提出之議程獲得協議。此議程中包括：（一）德國經濟政策方面之各問題；（二）柏林問題及柏林幣制問題；（三）籌備對德和約問題；及（四）完成奧國獨立條約問題。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿一日電〕蘇外長維辛斯基今日下午自莫斯科抵達巴黎奧利機場，以出席週一揭幕之巴黎四強外長會議。一行共乘兩機，第一架着陸者載有專家顧問等。維氏着灰色西服，含笑自第二機中走出，蘇大使波谷莫洛夫，首先上前歡迎。記者請維氏就本屆外長會發表少許意見，維氏操法語，答以稍待將有聲明發表。維氏與諸歡迎者一一握手畢，卽登車逕赴蘇大使館休息。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿一日電〕蘇聯外長維辛斯基抵此後，卽於今夜往法國外交部訪問法外長許曼，談話僅五分鐘卽辭出。維氏對各記者之問話笑而不答，僅謂：「余來巴黎甚為快慰，對於各位之問題，將在日後答覆」。</p>
<h3>西柏林工潮擴大　罷工者與反罷工者發生衝突　方開槍襲擊受傷五百餘人</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿二日電〕蘇區徳警廿二日清晨槍擊鐵路罷工工人，至少五人受傷，同時，使廿一日的竟日暴動，復趨向高潮。罷工工人與共產黨領導的反罷工者，在柏林東·西區徳警的衝突中，早已有五百人以上受傷。</p>
<p>由於柏林西區鐵路工人一萬五千人的罷工，柏林市區內外的架空鐵道交通，事實上完全斷絕。槍擊事件在兩處發生，當共產黨領導的反罷工者及裝甲的蘇區徳警企圖佔領尼魯·柯林車站而與罷工工人衝突時，開槍二十發以上，至少有五人受傷。西區罷工工人在子夜襲擊反罷工者及蘇區徳警封鎖之溫茜車站，但未成功，傷者尚無估計。雙方均執有槍械，尖鋤，鐵棍及電鞭。但據稱：僅共產黨領導之反罷工者開槍射擊，在尼魯·柯林車站，反罷工者曾在一度血戰後加以佔領，但嗣後經罷工工人反攻後逐出。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿一日電〕柏林鐵路工潮今夜引起大衝突後，蘇聯方面官員，蘇區警察及親共之「自由德國青年團」，已進佔西柏林四十座車站中之三座，在其餘各座，仍由獨立性工會人員把守，不許蘇區人員接收。按西柏林車站亦係歸蘇聯鐵路局所管，員工係因要求以西德馬克給付工資而罷工，參加者一萬二千人，當員工與共產黨人衝突時，曾有人向空開槍，並由火車一列被焚。</p>
<p>蘇運輸部長　在美區受傷</p>
<p>蘇運輸部長克伐許密將軍，在美區海孟特拉斯車站被衆所圍困，身受輕傷，後經西區警察救出，西區警察並已逮捕各站滋事首領廿二人。蘇方控制之柏林電台指員工已將波茨坦與伐恩賽間之路軌破壞數段，員工表示罷工將不妨碍西德駛至柏林之火車，但至晚六時為止，僅有英美軍車各一列，及魯爾駛來火車一列開抵柏林。柏林美軍司令霍來准將表示，若蘇方控制之鐵路警察行動越出民主範圍或無法維持秩序，將由西柏林警察接收各車站，非於動亂擴大牽涉盟國人員時，美軍將不出動。英軍政府運輸部官員亦表示，蘇軍政府祗須用西區的法幣——西德馬克給付員工工資，工潮卽可迅速解決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿一日電〕柏林西區罷工鐵路今夜已有一部份恢復通車，由蘇兵隨車保衛，其中一列開入美軍區，另一列開入法軍區，車頂均架機開槍。罷工者與警察整日衝突結果，五百人受傷。工人曾咀罵蘇方鐵路管理人員，並投擲石塊。舒霍尼堡車站共黨衛兵曾放出警犬咬傷罷工者一人。里丹拉特高架鐵路站鐵軌被掘。同時，美英飛機今日繼續空運，確保每日供應柏林西區食物及燃料八千噸。</p>
<h3>如徳警不能控制　美軍將出動</h3>
<p>美軍長官霍萊宣布</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林二十一日電〕柏林美軍長官霍萊今日招待記者稱，柏林西區鐵道工人之罷工，適在四國舉行會議之時，實屬不幸。但彼承認工人有權採取罷工行動，故美國軍政府並未下令中止罷工，但已向各工會領袖指出四國會談卽將開始，各工會領袖已允諾不阻碍封鎖解除後之交通。霍氏繼稱，工資糾紛，應由僱主與僱員間自行解決，故美國軍政府始終取不干涉政策，除非發生衝突而德國警察不能控制，否則美軍將不動員。霍氏又謂，西區工人工會及柏林市議會皆曾作談判之企圖，但皆被共黨控制之鐵道機構當局所拒。鐵道機構當局企圖利用五千餘名「黃色」共黨青年，在東區警察之保護下恢復行駛，且宣佈對一切阻止火車行駛者，皆將開槍格殺。</p>
<h3>東西德貿易談判　已陷於破壞</h3>
<p>美方表示幾已獲得協議</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林廿一日電〕東德經濟委員會主席海茵弗勞今日在此招待領有蘇軍執照之各報記者稱：東西德之經濟委員會各代表，對恢復區間貿易所作之會談，已陷於僵局。會談之破裂，乃因西德當局不願除去種種有害區間貿易之限制。按此項會談，於本星期初在柏林開始，但西德代表不久卽離此前往弗蘭克福，故並未獲任何結果，亦未規定繼續談判之期。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林廿一日電〕德境美軍首長海斯今日告記者稱：英美蘇三國財政專家，在最後一次會議中，幾已獲得協議。各專家已擬定一計劃，容許各佔領區間開始信用貸款，進而恢復東西德間之實際貿易。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林廿一日電〕德境蘇軍運輸主任克伐許甯今日通知美軍運輸主任及四國專家會議稱：彼已同意允許三十一艘駁船自西德進至柏林，供給柏林之糧食及其他物品。今日下午四國專家特在此召開會議，討論東西德間交通恢復後之各項問題，共達三小時之久。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕海軍部今日正式宣佈：前國防部長福萊斯特於今日侵晨二時自華盛頓附近之貝茜斯達海軍醫院病室中躍下自殺身死。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕前任國防部長福萊斯特今晨跳樓自殺，享年五十七歲。福氏自上月二日起在馬里蘭州貝茜斯達海軍醫院醫治神經疲勞症，不料遽爾輕生。據醫院宣布，福氏於今晨二時爬出鄰室樓窗躍下。該醫院高達十層以上，福氏之病室恰在最高一層。福氏於一八九二年二月生於紐約州之皮貢，曾入達特茅斯大學與普林斯頓大學肄業，半工半讀。第一次大戰時加入海軍為二等兵，轉入空軍，一九一八年入海軍參謀部服務。一九四〇年任海軍部次長，四年後，繼諾克斯為海軍部長，對於建設大海軍厥功甚偉。福氏抱人材主義，有時將海軍將領免除要職，而重用文官。一九四七年陸海空軍三部合併，福氏出任國防部長，直至最近始辭職，至其所患神經疲勞症，聞係戰時及戰後工作過度所致。</p>

<h3>美報評日賠償問題　盟國應放棄向日索取賠償</h3>
<p>〔美國新處華盛頓十八日電〕美國報紙對於日本賠償問題發表評論，繼續支持遠東委會美國代表麥考埃少將於上星期所宣布的美國政策。華盛頓郵報說：「美國對於停止索取日本賠償這種突然而似乎有些獨斷的行動，恰和平報早在一九四七年二月二日所發表的見解相脗合。當時有一點已經很明白，那就是假如盟國對於索取日賠償和分配的辦法不能商得協議，日本將永不能復興。十一國遠東委會自從一九四五年開始成立以來，對於日本賠償一直爭執不休。主要的爭執者當然是蘇聯，這個國家曾經澈底地掠奪滿洲，包括日本在滿洲的產業在內。這就是蘇聯在滿時作戰一星期的一張賬單，可是莫斯科拒絕說明它所奪取的賠償品的名稱。此外，還有從日本獲得的其他東西，總之日本在國外的資產共减少了三十億美元。關於正規的賠償問題，要求賠償各國依然陷於僵局，雖然美國曾屢屢設法打破這個難關。起先是對美國的任何要求加以非難，繼而是開始地賠償品（包括若干數量的機械在內）搬運到若干提出賠償要求的國家，作為一種初步賠償的解決辦法。可是賠償總額以及分配方法依然無法可以確定。根據這些以及其他的理由，決定整個賠償問題的解決辦法實有迫切的需要。美國除佔領費用外，每年爲了日本的經濟還要用去三四億美元，藉以把生活必需品供給日本人民。這種補貼辦法在日本人民中形成一種依賴的態度，難以去除，不足以鼓勵日本設法在經濟上自己立定脚跟。再者，更進一步搬走日本的生產設備儘足以削减日本獲得經濟自給的能力，後者乃是佔領日本的一個主要目的。要求把日本的生產配備搬走到遠東方面若干提出賠償要求的國家去，也不見得對這些國有多大助益。日本方面比較近乎有「多餘的」重工業配備，搬走起來費用很大，而且假如沒有第二步加工的配備，往往也沒有用處，而這些提出賠償要求的國家是沒有這種加工配備的。至於它們可以更容易加以利用的輕工業配備，就日本的平時需要言並不能被認為有多餘，假如日本要在世界貿易中可以支持它本身的話。因為日本和英國必須輸入食物和原料，同時輸出製成品以償付輸入。日本在經濟上恢復為一個進行對外貿易的國家，不但對於日本和美國納稅人者，同時對於整個遠東也是有利的，因為遠東貿易的恢復足以消除目前的混亂，並且可以防止共產主義的宣傳。」芝加哥每日論壇報說：「這個新政策顯然是對的，而且早就應該採用了…。當世界正需要生產的時候，我們竟讓生產的設備被拆去，但在機器搬移的時候，一定受到損壞，在新工廠在海外新地方建立以前，將損失不少生產，且缺乏控制機器的技術人才而有更多的　　損失。…我們的政府最後已採用一種政策，其實這個政策，早就應該採用了。」印第安那波里斯新聞報宣稱：美國中心要求賠償的決議「是根據嚴格的實際的考慮。」該報引證遠東委員會的未能同意一種賠償的目錄表，美國對日本經濟的貼補，分担在滿洲已經被蘇聯拿去的賠償，以及中國所得的賠償將落入共黨手中的事實。該報復稱：「不幸的是菲律賓也將被剝奪日本濫肆掠奪和破壞所應付的賠償。但是據紐約時報的評論，卽使在這種情形之下，「這是很顯明的：菲律賓如果繼續和一個卸去對日本負担的美國在一起，並在健全的太平洋經濟中（這種情形必須有一個有支付能力的日本）佔一個健全的地位，那末菲律賓所得的利益，更多於從一個經濟拮据的美國或一個破產的日本所得到的利益。所以，保留日本以前指定為賠償四國的工業，意思就是設法使日本在經濟上儘速自立。這是一種政策的突然轉變，但這種轉變當根據一個健全的原則：卽世界如欲享受民主與和平，必須有健全的社會和健全的經濟。」華盛頓每日新聞報說：「終止向日本索取戰爭損失的賠償，有一個十分充足的理由，那就是以後日本將付的賠款，將由美國的口袋中取出來，而不是日本所付的。盟國向日本已取得不少賠償，而我們所担任的負担也很可觀。我們不能再替日本付出其餘的賠償要求。沒有一個人能以戰爭獲取盈利。巨大財產的化費和破壞，必須作為全部的損失。這就是我們不向日本要求賠償的情形。問題是怎樣在太平洋區建立一個自己生活與人生活的經濟，以便證明人類的拯救在於和平·合作而不是在於軍事·經濟和政治的壓迫。</p>
<h3>今日之伊朗</h3>
<p>本報編譯室特譯稿</p>
<p>自從柏林封鎖解除以後，歐洲的緊張局勢，已漸趨鬆弛，世人的目光逐漸轉移到亞洲方面去。伊朗是東方古國，地位要衝，在歷史上久已為異族爭奪之地，到今日又已成為蘇聯與西方集團冷戰的焦點。爰將本文譯載於比，以養讀者，藉窺伊朗問題重要性的一般。</p>
<p>冷戰在伊朗自古有之，不自今日始。</p>
<p>伊朗是中東最富饒的國家，有着一千五百哩的邊界和蘇聯接壤。它是波斯灣的橋頭堡，蘇彝士運河通印度洋的入口，古時東方行商必經之路。在六千年的悠久的歷史上，伊朗不斷地受着異族侵略的威脅。今日的伊朗，處於大西洋和蘇聯兩大勢力圈對峙的世界中，正面臨着西方的壓力，而頑強英勇地維持着它的獨立。</p>
<p>蘇聯軍隊曾經佔領過而又撤離，並未成立永久性的傀儡政府，在世界上祗有伊朗一國。這是由於伊朗的政治手腕和聯合國的道義上的壓力使然。可是這反而引起更多的糾紛。</p>
<p>有一位伊朗的官員說明伊朗的外交地位稱：美國在中東方面的政策是我們最為担心的。希臘和土耳其已藉美國的軍事援助而鞏固其地位，這使伊朗受到更大的壓力。</p>
<p>然而伊朗處於兩大勢力圈之間，始終保持其獨立的地位，從未正式要求美國給予軍事上的保障。但伊朗政府曾經聘請美國軍事代表團，訓練其軍隊和憲兵，並獲得美國的　餘物資。</p>
<p>可是那軍事訓練團却加强了蘇聯侵略和佔領的威脅。伊朗久困於歷代蘇聯政府的熱戰和冷戰。蘇聯共產黨執政以後，曾於一九二一年和伊朗簽訂友好條約，以根絕俄皇的侵略。但是那條約裏面載有一條，規定：倘白俄反革命軍隊聚集於伊朗國土，蘇聯政府有權將軍隊開入伊朗國境，以便採取必要的自衛措施。</p>
<p>列甯政府所恐懼的威脅是消失了，但蘇聯覺得那一個條款對於執行政策非常便利。該條款第一次被利用是在一九四一年，那時蘇聯和英國軍隊佔領伊朗，利用該國為經由波斯灣運送租借物資至蘇聯的橋樑。</p>
<p>一九四六年，在聯合國的限期告終以後數星期，蘇聯軍隊接受勸告退出伊朗，而以油田特許權為許諾。他們相信在伊朗最大省區亞塞爾拜然省已經建立了一個傀儡政府。</p>
<p>想不到伊朗總理蘇丹尼一鳴驚人，派遣軍隊和親共軍隊作戰了一天，重新佔領亞省。同時蘇氏一手包辦的國會一致表决否認給予蘇聯油田特許權的許諾。現在，逃脫絞刑的亞省領袖都在蘇聯的庇護下，同時蘇聯在亞省的勢力已空前衰落。</p>
<p>等到蘇聯的勢力逐漸恢復時，它又發動攻勢，指責美國軍事訓練團企圖把伊朗變成一個威脅蘇聯的戰略基地。蘇駐伊大使薩契柯夫於一九四八年一月三十一日，三月廿四日，及四月八日以照會遞交伊朗政府，說蘇聯認為一九二一年友好條約已被破壞，蘇政府援用該條約，得自由佔領伊朗，以保護其南部邊疆。伊朗駁斥蘇聯的指責為「毫無根據」，譴責其行動為「干涉伊朗內政」，並指出伊蘇兩國在聯合國憲章下所負的義務已經把那一九二一年條約的佔領條文作廢了。</p>
<p>自莫斯科電台不斷作威嚇的攻擊，伊朗封閉各地的蘇聯領事館，和邊界一帶發生的零碎的衝突以後，伊朗的冷戰一天熱似一天了。</p>
<p>德黑蘭官方提出警告，勿以此等小事與大問題相提並論。伊朗封閉蘇聯領事館，是因為蘇聯拒絕給予互惠特權。在人口稀少的荒漠上，邊界衝突事件已經連續發生，有五十年的歷史了。</p>
<p>伊朗正在注視着世界列強政策的動向，同時伊朗有其本身的問題，如確立國內政治上的團結和消滅國家的極度貧困等，須待解決。</p>

<h3>上海蔬菜的供應</h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕早晨，主婦或娘姨們，提了籃上小菜塲去，問問蔬菜的價格，又是吃驚地說：昨天還祗有多少錢一斤呢，今天怎麼貴了這許多。遇到鄰居的小姊妹們也討論着物價的每天上漲，砲火已經聽得到了，他們還要這樣地黑心。她們知道砲火的逼近，促成蔬菜的上漲，但這原因在那裏呢？</p>
<p>上海是一個工商業的大都市，人烟稠密，卽使有零星的空地，也是面積狹小，那裏有可以種植蔬果之地。正是商本乎工，工本乎農，上海雖已發展成為五六百萬人口的大都市，但仍脫離不了農村的。工廠的原料，好多是農產品。數百萬市民的糧食，也是仰給於農村的，連佐餐的蔬菜，也非賴農村的供運不可。</p>
<p>上海有六百萬市民，平均每人每天消耗半斤蔬菜就要三萬担。這三萬担的蔬菜，從何而來呢？大都來自上海鄰近各縣，黃渡，浦東，崑山，松江，蘇州，無錫，南通，平湖，杭州，甯波各地，都有蔬菜運來供應上海市民的消耗。例如青菜，雪菜，來自黃渡，黃芽菜産於崇明北沙，捲心菜以浦東，崇明為多，洋山芋也是黃渡來的，蘿蔔自無錫，蘇州運來，杭州，甯波的筍，也是上海的來源。更遠的，河北，山東的白菜，東北的大蒜，廣東的豌荳，也運來上海供應。</p>
<p>在過去，老閘橋，新閘橋，十六浦，曹家渡等處，都是蔬菜的集散地。那裏兩旁的店鋪，完全是地貨行，連馬路兩旁的人行道，也作為蔬菜的臨時堆棧。裝滿一船一船的蔬菜，從各地運到上海，都向那裏集中。有的就直接由地貨行收買下來，也有地貨行作為居間人，轉賣給菜販，抽取若干的佣金。</p>
<p>每天黎明以前，是地貨行營業最興盛的時間那裏熙熙攘攘，一片嘈雜聲，就是菜販們去批采了。菜，筐子，老虎車，橡皮車，卡車，自推的小車，擠得東碰西撞，一到七八點鐘，人慢慢地少了，聲音也漸漸地靜下來。下午還有一次市面，有時比早晨　來得熱鬧，那是菜販批了去明天賣的。因為菜販們批了菜回來，還要加以檢選，整理，修飾的工夫。青菜的黃葉，必須要除棄的，雖然在重量上打了一個八折，但可以多賣些錢。像瓜果之類，還要按照大小揀選一下，因為他們的價值是不一致的。籃筐山還要洒一點水，保持他新鮮的顏色，以免明天賣不起錢。</p>
<p>在日寇佔領上海的時候，為着要達成控制市塲，收括物資的目的，連這一點農產品也不肯放鬆。在新垃圾橋北堍，成立了中央市塲，分醃臘，地貨，北貨，蛋　，藥材，酒業，中紙，柴炭，　料，柏油等部門，另在麥根路，南市裏馬路，滬西中山路，斜橋，江灣，浦東，土山灣各地分設支塲，完成他控制的目的，強逼着新閘橋，老閘橋一帶的地貨行，都到那裏去營業；農民也不得不用血汗換來的收成，讓敵人去支配。那裏的交易，塲方要抽百分之二十六的利潤；反造成了菜價的上漲。勝利以後，中央市塲也和其他的敵偽機關一樣，由市政府接收。初擬加以改善，繼續辦理，改名為上海市農產市塲；旋因參議會之提議而停辦。停辦以後，地貨行反感覺到營業不便，於是另成立了蔬菜運銷聯運商塲以替代之。</p>
<p>上海六百萬市民每日所需的蔬菜，旣不產在上海，而賴外埠的供應；那末運輸是維繫來源的主要工作。在平時，接連下幾天雨，或是隆冬飛雪的日子，到貨稀少，貨價也要上漲些。戰火逼近上海，對外的交通綫减少，菜蔬的來源不能暢通，供不應求，自然更要高漲。過去幾次戰爭，幣值雖還很穩定，但也要漲上二三倍。如今一面到貨旣少，一面幣值又跌，那得不大跳而特跳呢？</p>
<p>在抗戰初期，上海淪為孤島，各地的蔬菜不能運入上海市區，居民大為恐慌。一度由地貨業公會，租用英國輪駁，赴高橋南通等地去採辦蔬菜。後來各地交通雖漸漸接通，但仍不准蔬菜等運入市區，致鐵絲網外之蔬菜價格低落，任令枯萎，而市區內之價格，狂漲不已。雖有許多人為生活所逼，冒險設法運入，費用旣多，售價當然也不會低的。</p>
<p>上海市民現正忙着糧米，買柴，儲藏準備着。糧食固然是一個大問題，但祗有飯而沒有菜也不行的。有錢的人家，早已備好了火腿，罐頭等，普通人家也都備一點鹹黃魚之類。至於蔬菜呢，因為是鮮貨，無法大批地買來儲藏着，雖然一天天的貴，主婦們對着發愁，但也是無可奈何的。</p>
<h3>東西佛種下禍根　閩南械鬥內幕　番客錢火上加油</h3>
<p>〔晋江訊〕械鬥，雖然不是閩南的特產，但閩南械鬥却是遠近聞名的。從表面上看：閩南古有「海濱鄒魯」的盛譽，又是文物鼎盛的名邦，民風不應該野蠻了，而且地居海口，對於交通發達極早，人民亦多有飄浮經商的習慣，在外博見廣聞，照理基於野蠻與狹量而發生的械鬥不應該有。可是閩南偏有具着幾百年歷史而迄今尚未能消滅的械鬥。</p>
<p>那麼；械鬥究是怎樣產生的呢</p>
<p>有人說，閩南雖然對外交通自早發達，但是本質仍然是個農業社會，在農業社會之中，人民視土地如生命，界域觀念很深，又因聚族而居，宗系鄉黨觀念也極濃厚，械鬥便是這兩種觀念交織下的產物。這樣說法固有道理，不過幾十年來，中國社會那裏不是農業社會，閩南的械鬥何以特別熾盛呢？實在構成閩南的械鬥，還有兩個主因，第一是「東西佛」，第二是「番客錢」（僑款）。這兒我們先介紹關於「東西佛」：東西佛的挿</p>
<p>譬如閩南的械鬥可以編寫一部「械鬥史」，那麼「東西佛」，可以在這部史上佔着極重要的地位。我們固然不否認許多械鬥是肇因於宗族間（姓氏）的糾紛，可是有許多械鬥是肇因於「東西佛」的，而有更多的械鬥是肇因於宗族糾紛，而由「東西佛」來推波助瀾地把它擴大的。</p>
<p>「東西佛」（這一個外地人鮮聞的名詞）是什麽東西呢？</p>
<p>讓我們複述一篇古老的民間傳說罷。</p>
<p>在清初的時候，晋江有兩個喧赫一時的大官，一是靖海將軍靖海侯施琅，一是富翰林（名不詳）。那一年，富翰林的女兒嫁給施將軍作兒媳，施將軍自恃是朝廷名將，曾經在富翰林登門探親的時候，故意穿起天子特賜的「黃馬褂」，以致親家翁一見「黃馬褂」的時候，不得不跪下來向天子行禮。這個捉弄使富翰林暗中大為不滿，禮尚往來，現在輪到施將軍去回拜富翰林了，富翰林不但掛上當年「五日權君」所時獲御賜的「鐵鼻」，並且還在大廳上遍洒泥濘，使施將軍看到「鐵鼻」，也不得不急忙跪下來向天子行禮，而他跪下的地方又是很骯髒的泥濘。因此，親家變成冤家了。施將軍力圖報復，但又不便自己出面，只好很巧妙的想出一個辦法，利用小地域觀念和神權，尋　滋事，而富翰林對抗他的剛好也是這個辦法。那時，施將軍居住的是城東「鳳池舖」，富翰林居住的是城西「奉聖舖」。他們各自活動，儘量尋求友舖，以神權為號召，把友舖的舖主公（神偶和弟子，神棍，流氓）都稱兄道弟地結盟起來，全城三十六舖便分成兩個陣綫，以「鳳池」「奉聖」為盟主，號稱「東佛」「西佛」，且由城區的舖境，擴展到城外的鄉村，由晉江擴展至閩南各縣，幾沒有一個角落不捲入。而「東西佛」的唯一工作，便是互相仇視，進行械鬥，二三百年來不知流了多少血，枉死了多少人命，冤仇則一直愈結愈深。</p>
<p>可笑的幾個例</p>
<p>一個甲姓的村落和一個乙姓的村落發生糾紛，許多甲姓和乙姓的其他村落都爭先恐後地自動來幫助各人的宗族，這樣就　成械鬥。</p>
<p>一個「東佛」舖份和一個「西佛」舖份發生糾紛，許多「東佛」和「西佛」的其他舖份和村落都爭先恐後的自動來幫助各人的「盟友」，這樣也釀成械鬥。</p>
<p>一個甲姓的和一個乙姓村落發生糾紛，許多甲姓和許多乙姓的其他村落；以及屬於甲姓和乙姓的其他「東佛」或「西佛」也都來幫助各人的宗族和盟友，這樣釀成更大的械鬥。</p>
<p>這是械鬥的形成。但是，足以引起械鬥的所謂「糾紛」，有時候簡直是笑話而不是糾紛，最早的械鬥或者真的是發生於相當嚴重的糾紛，不過後來，我們常聽得到的一些械鬥的原因，與其說是「糾紛」，毋甯說是頑強的愚蠢的，其實又是極空泛的傳統的觀念。</p>
<p>以下是一些可笑的例子：</p>
<p>一個甲村的人經過乙村，因為天氣熱，停在樹蔭下休息，一個乙村的小孩在他背上拍死一隻蒼蠅，這人認為小孩玩皮，回手給他一個耳光，小孩子哭了，於是乙村鳴鑼列械來抵抗乙村了，這樣居然演成了一個大規模的械鬥。</p>
<p>甲村的孩子放牛，這不懂人事的牛，偶然伸頭越界去喫一口乙村的青草，乙村不但把牛或牧童擄去，而且提出交涉，恰巧甲村也不示弱，於是居然也訴諸械鬥了。</p>
<p>「東佛」迎神的隊伍，因為轉巷抹角的關係，偶然有一人不慎一脚踏過毗鄰的「西佛」的界綫，早在窺伺監視的「西佛」便衝過來了，不僅打人，而且要搗毀神駕或儀仗，一塲打之後，正式的械鬥就隨之而來了。</p>
<p>這些雖因年代久遠，說不出當事的地名村名，但是確實有其事。記者曾經和一個鄉村的小學生談話，這學生正在大講他們的村莊和別的村莊械鬥之事。記者問：「爲什麽你們無緣無故和×村械鬥起來呢？爲什麽你們小孩子也這樣熱心於械鬥呢？」那個小孩子回答：「×村是我們的仇敵，祖父說，你們不要饒過×村的人。」</p>
<p>誰在助長械鬥</p>
<p>械鬥爲什麽不能消滅呢。</p>
<p>答曰：有人有形無形的在助長械鬥。</p>
<p>閩南進步得太慢了，這是說封建殘餘的力量，還頑強地保守在閩南社會之中，儘管二十年來，文化教育（指報紙上學校）事業相當普遍與發達，所發生移風易俗的教化作用却不大，在今日的社會上，還是到處講宗族，講鄉黨的。不過，這種社會進步得太慢，並不是助長械鬥的全部原因，雖然它是原因之一。（未完）</p>

<h3>訪台灣烏日糖廠</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>烏日糖廠是臺灣糖業公司數十個製糖廠所之一，它的前身，是日糖興業株式會社烏日製糖所，資本二百二十五萬日元，最初的名稱為臺中製糖株式會社，嗣又收買特木壯造及廖煥文兩人共營的番社脚製糖會社及赤塘工塲，當初壓榨能力僅三五〇噸，迨一九二一年五月與東洋製糖株式會社合併，籌設新式工塲，壓榨能力增至四五〇英噸。嗣後又將社口，丁　原有赤塘工塲區域劃入，至一九二七年十二月，併入日糖興業株式會社。光復後，由糖業公司經營，隸屬於第一分公司烏日糖廠的規模頗大，廠長以下，設置總務課：分文書，人事，事務，採購，物料，成品，營務，醫務等各股；會計課：分帳務，成本，綜核三股；工務課：分製糖，機械，化騐三股，農務課：分原料，農塲，土地，秤量四股；鐵道課：分機務，養路，運務等三股，其餘並設有員工勵進會一處。員工不但有豐富的經騐，熟練的技能，且亦頗合作努力，因此生產方面有蒸蒸日上之勢。</p>
<p>原料增產方面，該廠在三十四，三十五年期，僅有蔗田三百餘甲，這是因為戰爭期中，日人爲了補給軍糧的需要，對於蔗作地，大都自由任其廢耕，改種稻穀的緣故。自接收以後，該廠卽獎勵農民種植蔗苗，惟農民多存猶豫觀望心理，後一再經該廠派員分赴各鄉鎮宣傳勸導，並從事調查種植面積同時實施分糖法，後又由五十二與四十八之比，而增至五十與五十對比，至此，農民因利益增加，已非過往日人時代榨取情形可比，乃紛紛爭種甘蔗，蔗園面積日漸擴充，三十六，三十七年期，已增至一，〇七一·四六甲之多，預計三七，三八年期種種面積，當可臻至一，六六〇·八一甲。</p>
<p>對於農務設施，如水利的開闢，品種的選擇，以及病害蟲的防除等，該廠無不竭慮盡力，以臻完善。至於土地方面，因為日人時代政策不同，情形尤見複雜，經年來積極整頓，漸上軌道，並遵照省令辦理公地放租，又於前年七月一日，設立北　坑甘蔗專營合作農塲一所，旣可增產原料，又能救濟一般失業農民，裨益農村經濟至鉅。現在該廠設有原料區共九所，自營農塲共三所。</p>
<p>其次，說到該廠的壓榨能力和製糖概况。該廠在戰爭期中，損失不大，雖曾被炸兩次，惟均未爆發，嗣因年久失修，各種器材，亟待重整，接收後，卽積極展開復興工作，經年餘的努力，如搔卸機，送蔗機，細裂機，壓榨機，汽缸，煱爐，加熱缸，蒸發缸，助晶機，分密機等均經修復完竣。卅四，卅五年製糖期，因為原料不足，工塲尚未修竣，致將全期收穫原料，移運臺中糖廠壓榨，而三十六年，卅七年期，因原料充沛，而且各部機械亦已次第完成，所有員工無不情緒振奮，現廠房及機件氣管等全部油漆，煥然一新。三十七年一月開始壓榨，為期僅二個月，以石灰法製造二號砂白，壓榨能力為八百噸，發電一百七十六KW。</p>
<p>該廠原來自營鐵道，計有水崛頭，社口，丁臺各綫，總長達五十三公里，並備有機關車五臺，甘蔗車二百六十輛，臺車二百八十輛，綫路均分佈各原料區，以搬運原料和材料為主要任務。惟接管時期，各綫路無一完整，非枕木腐蝕，則橋樑損害，後來經依照鐵道事業計劃，按期復舊，現在水崛頭，社口各綫，林厝運絡綫等工程均已先後竣事。機關車的修理，甘蔗車的改造，道標的刷新，車輛的油漆，亦已分別積極進行之中。惟該廠鐵路綫路，多經中部的烏溪，猫羅溪等，錯流其間，致必多深設橋樑，而每屆雨季時期，多被冲毁，因而僅在製糖期前架設，製糖期後卽行撤回，致使該廠每年均有是項臨時工程。又去年六月間霉雨為災，主要幹綫筏子溪橋樑為之冲毀，經招商趕工修復，此項工程亦已於去年十二月底完成通車，使本期運務，免受影響，而得如期增產。</p>
<p>爲了鼓勵員工工作情緒，並輔助其安定生活起見，該廠對於員工福利設施，素極重視，舉如子女教育補助費，生活補助費的發給，消費合作社的設置等。其他如醫務室，圖書室，理髮所，洗浴室，運動塲等設備亦均具規模。此外，並在附近廠址內設立福利農塲，播種稻穀及開闢菜園。</p>
<p>自年三十六年四月一日起，成立員工勵進會一所，關於全廠員工福利事業移歸該會統辦後，成績尤著，如組織旅行團，分批觀光名勝，籌辦第一屆運動會，舉行嬰兒健康比賽會等，並爲了促進員工身心進修，及融洽感情消除隔閡起見，還開辦國語講習班兩期，同時舉行國語演講競賽會，成績斐然。</p>
<p>烏日糖廠光復後，整頓設備，修復器材，頗費時間，去年一月方得開始壓榨，惟成績仍不下於其他糖廠，現在該廠正本着原定目標努力策進，尤側重於農務的改革，原料的增產，成本的减輕，技術的改進，品質的提高，副產品的利用等等，以謀積極生產。</p>

<p>被俘獲之共軍，由國軍詢問時情形（本報攝）</p>
<h3>乍晴乍雨小滿節　明日可望見陽光</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市氣候之惡劣，為本月份中所僅見。重雲低壓，離地不過一千呎。晨五時許雷電陣雨，擾人清夢。及後細雨濛濛，時歇時降。中午時分雖曾一度雨止雲開，陽光普照，惟為時甚短，轉瞬天空重為陰霾進據。室內牆壁地面亦復潮濕異常。據氣象台報告：於本月初旬起，太平洋氣流與大陸氣流卽在揚子江下游接觸，遂造成乍晴乍雨之低氣壓現象，此卽晨　中「　季」以前之「小滿節」氣候。昨日起風向已轉為中度北風至東北風，可能在日本海上空已有高氣壓出現所致。今日天氣仍陰，惟雲層可望提高至三千呎至六千呎，此對我英勇空軍當有幫助。明日或可見陽光，胥視風向有無變化而定。但欲長期放晴，尚需過若干時日也。</p>

<h3>勞軍勸募運動　市民熱烈輸將　今日繼續廣播節目精彩</h3>

<h3>方主委廣播詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕昨日勸募勞軍廣播中，陳市長，陳司令，及該會主任委員方治等均蒞臨播講，茲將方主任委員播講之「共匪自掘墳墓於上海」演詞節錄於後：</p>
<p>發揮真正威力</p>
<p>從吳淞和浦東的國軍所得戰果看來，共匪實在是沒有什麽了不起，我們大家不是聽見嗎？匪曾在過去廣播說什麽十五日進攻上海，十七日佔駐上海，但是今天的上海，依然無恙，這可證明匪的宣傳，完全是騙人的，只要我們全市的父老大家團結起來，不驚慌，不害怕，上海的保衛戰必得最後的勝利。要知保衛上海，卽所以保衛中國，我們如不能在上海消滅共匪，卽無處可以消滅它，過去國軍之所以撤退，完全是爲了戰略關係，而現在則是已到了國軍忍無可忍，真正發揮威力的時候，也卽是開始消滅共匪主力的時候了。</p>
<p>國軍在上海作戰，不但是爲了要爭取國家民族的獨立，而且是爲了保衛我們全市六百萬市民的生命財產而作戰的，因此，我們做老百姓的，只有大家一心一德，動員所有財力物力來支援前綫。我們在這一切為前綫一切為士兵，和一切為剿匪的前提下，希望同胞們要認識保衛戰的重要，並以最大的熱忱來響應。今天慰勞會所發動的勞軍運動，我們固不必人人上前綫作戰，但捐輸財物踴躍慰勞，卽所以鼓勵前方將士。</p>
<p>熱烈慰勞將士</p>
<p>關於各界慰勞品捐獻，可以送到社會局慰勞會，款項則送上海市銀行及其分辦事處，慰勞會將這些款物收集後，就立卽分別贈送前方將士，以副各位同胞的熱望。</p>
<p>同胞們，我們除了熱烈慰勞前方將士，以盡各人一己對國家的貢獻和良心以外，同時我們更應盡我們老百姓對安定地方的責任，因為本市內部尚有少數的陰謀份子，企圖乘隙破壞搗亂騷擾，我們對這些奸徒匪諜份子，必須給以無情的打擊，澈底的予以消滅，才可以確保安全。現在淞滬警備司令部已訂有獎勵檢舉共匪辦法，希望大家要共同注意，共同努力，本人謹以最大的誠意向各位同生死共患難的同胞們最大的呼籲，卽我們要救國救己，必須要一切為前綫，一切為士兵，儘力捐輸，並嚴密檢舉肅清共匪間諜。</p>
<p>此外，最近郊區難胞因受砲火的關係，流離失所，痛苦萬分，這種情形，湯總司令極為關懷，正積極督促當局加緊設法救濟，使難胞們食宿得以無憂。不過，在此戰事緊張的時候，我們也只有咬緊牙關，忍受一切艱苦，以爭取自由民主的保障和保衛戰的勝利。只要我們全市六百萬市民團結起來，動員起來，必能剿滅共匪，使上海成為共匪自掘墳墓的地方。</p>
<h3>龍華區七家米店　被檢舉配米舞弊　低價向居民收買配米證　陶關金張秀餘二名扣押</h3>
<p>本市龍華區漕涇鎮經配米店七家，勾結該區辦理配給戶口米人員，收買配米證，塗改簽認證，從中舞弊圖利，被市民發覺，向陳市長告密，業經市府派員查實，並將有關人犯陶關金，張秀餘二名扣押，正繼續追究其他案犯中。緣龍華區四月份第三聯戶口配米，按照規定，應於五月十日辦竣，該區所轄七寶·梅隴·莘莊，因接近前綫，配米無法運送，本市米價，逐步上漲，配價差額愈大，漕涇鎮經配米店：公興·駱合盛·賓大·萬泰·公大·勤記·張隆順等七家，紛紛以低價收購配米證，向民食調配處抵賬，對外宣稱配米業已售罄，致漕涇鎮附近居民，大半無法購得。後經龍華區冠生園路秋記米店周秋生，激於義憤，出面公開檢舉。據悉：民食調配處第六督導區王委員於五月十一日上午在龍華區公所口頭通知該區米商王銀松代理人公興米號職員陶關金，囑卽通知各經配米店先行收取配米證，連同米款於十一日解繳銀行，俟當日下午配米運到，再行補發，藉平公憤。陶關金除受王委員面命照辦外，曾向張進福等住戶收買配米證四十五張，以每張平均十萬元向張隆順等七家米店買進食米二百廿五市斤，復受民調處職員李有倫之命，以普通配米與公教人員重點配米數量不符，囑各米店塗改簽認證，該區張隆順米店主人張秀餘於五月八日領到四月份第三聯戶口米後，曾以食米五十市斤向該區居民項瑞昌佣人阿毛買得配米證二十張，另又向人收買配米證一百五十市斤，對外以食米售罄，拒絕配發，所以非法私購戶口米三百零七斤，業經龍華區警察分局予以全部扣獲。又該區萬泰，駱合盛二米店主任楊紀根，薛餘春，均非法收買配米證。</p>
<p>以圖厚利</p>
<p>聞陶關金，張秀餘二名，已扣押市警察局，直認舞弊不諱。陳市長為整飭綱紀，嚴懲貪污，決澈底追究本案有關舞弊人員，依法嚴辦，並追究該區過去辦理配米有無類此情事，務使配米能確實惠及居民。至出面檢舉之秋紀米店主人周秋生，義勇可嘉，當局將特別予以獎勵。</p>
<h3>徐家匯八教區　收容難民　已逾三千　五百餘已有住所　缺乏燃料難舉炊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據天主教教務協進會消息：近兩週來徐家匯天主教八個中心區內，包括土山灣男孤兒院，聖母院女孤兒院，上海教區修院，徐家匯天文台等處，已收容有自滬西南郊十至廿哩範圍內鄉間逃難來滬之難民三千二百人。聖依納爵堂司鐸徐宗海並將其學校校舍及神父住宅，完全撥與渠等居住，故其中五百餘名之難民住屋問題已告解決。此輩難民在來滬時大都均隨身帶有食米一兩袋，惟因缺乏燃料，乃艱舉炊。</p>
<h3>渝交通公用事業　奉命改收金圓券</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿二日電〕此間公私營各業，先後以銀元計價，而政府所支付者，又為金圓券，致糾紛迭起。長官公署頃特規定辦法兩項：（一）各交通公用事業機關，為維持其正常業務，其成本計算可以銀元價格為參考。（二）各交通公用事業機關，自卽日起一律照收金圓券，如有強迫收銀元者，准許人民檢舉，從嚴懲處。</p>
<h3>霍亂傷寒痢疾等三種　為本市最流行傳染病　夏季又到防疫工作需要迫切</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕戰火燃燒在上海四郊，難民大量擁入市區，人口激增，大家在小天地中耳聽砲聲，擒於一起生活，環境衛生絕難顧及。在這夏季已臨的時候，防疫工作將是一件最迫切的工作。</p>
<p>上海歷年所流行的傳染病疫主要的有天花·霍亂·傷寒·痢疾和腦膜炎。其中以霍亂·傷寒和痢疾三種在夏天最為普遍流行。究其原因，大部分是由飲食傳染而起的。此外如濕度和蚊虫也和疾病的流傳很有關係。關於濕度，據研究，霍亂的流行與該區內的絕對濕度有關。就上海而論，濕度到了水銀柱十公　以下，霍亂就不會流行。目前以人工來改變氣溫還辦不到，但我們如果能注意環境衛生和個人攝生，則氣溫對於身體抵抗力的影響，也可以减少到極低的限度。譬如多休息，飲食睡眠有節制等等，都可以加強人體對於疾病的抵抗力。</p>
<p>掘土井飲水　應注意消毒</p>
<p>就預防方面說，除了接受預防注射外，對於飲用水的清潔與否最應注意。據卅五年和卅六年兩年中上海市霍亂症的調查，結果發現很多病例都是由於喝土井水而起。目前有許多里弄都掘了土井，在應用的時候應特別注意消毒。此外對於糞便污水的處理亦應留心。一般市民更應共同警惕，不飲生水，不食以生水灑過的瓜菓食物，使病菌無從傳染。</p>
<p>不潔之瓜菓　是疾病媒介</p>
<p>夏季市上的不潔瓜菓，飲料和棒冰之類，是疾病的媒介。去年衛生局曾化騐街頭呌賣的棒冰，結果發現百分之九十九是不合格的，合格的祗不過一二種。那些攤上自製的「冰凍汽水」之類，情形也是如此。對於這種不潔飲料，當局雖加取締，但飲者自飲，等到得了病，受苦已深。所以市民應自加警惕，切勿隨意購食。此外如滅蠅滅蚊的工作也嘗普遍推行。DDT是近年發明極有效的藥劑，市民在經濟力可能的情形下，可於居處普遍噴射消毒。</p>
<p>無力謀營養　抵抗力大减</p>
<p>中國老話說，大戰以後，必有疫　。但目前由於生活逼人，一般中下市民對營養方面已無餘力顧到，身體抵抗力大大减低，疾病容易乘虛而入。更因經濟情形　困，對醫藥之應用亦感力不從心。故如一有傳染病疫發生，勢將如火燎原，難以撲滅。所以今年夏天上海如果發生疫　，其情形定將相當可怕。防疫工作實已迫切急要的事。</p>
<p>防疫如防火　應羣策羣力</p>
<p>市衛生當局固應在可能範圍內負責領導做起，但防疫這件事不是當局或市民單獨所能做得好的，必須有衛生當局的計劃指導和經濟力量，再加上全市市民的合作，始克有成。防疫如防火，僅是獨善其身是沒有用的。疫　如果流行，則個人的安全也就危在旦夕，所以防疫必須是有計劃的，有組織的和有目標的。在力之所及範圍內羣策羣力做去，雖然不能說可絕對阻止疫症的發生，至少可减輕許多。</p>

<h3>National Army Launches Full-Scale Offensive in Pudong; Fiercely Fights Using Intense Firepower; Recovers Dozens of Strongholds Southeast of Gaoqiao</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military Dispatch: A telephone call from the Pudong front at 9:30 PM on the 22nd stated: (1) A certain unit of our army, in coordination with friendly forces in Gaoqiao, launched a fierce attack on bandits who had fled north from Xijiazhai and bandits who had fled north from Zhoujiaqiubridge from the west on the morning of the 22nd. The bandits attempted to flee in different directions but were intercepted and annihilated by our forces. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. Our forces continued the pursuit to places like Xujiazhai, Majiazhai, Zhoujiazhai, and Taojiazhai. In this battle, over a thousand bandits were killed or wounded. A certain elite unit launched a fierce attack, killing over 500 bandits and capturing 32 alive (including one bandit battalion commander). They seized five heavy machine guns, over 20 submachine guns, and over 200 rifles. Over 500 remnant bandits infiltrated our army's positions through gaps. Our army immediately imposed a strict blockade to encircle and annihilate them. The bandits attempted to break through and escape, but under our fierce artillery fire, they failed and were completely annihilated. In the afternoon at 7:00 PM, several hundred more bandits arrived and are currently under our close surveillance, unable to act rashly. (4) In the afternoon of the 22nd, about 200 bandits in front of Tangqiao attempted to infiltrate our positions. Our certain unit bravely launched an offensive, killing 27 bandits on the spot and seizing 25 rifles. We suffered no casualties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military Dispatch: General Zou Peng, commander of a certain division of the National Army, received orders on the 21st to lead his troops across the river to search and suppress bandits in the southeastern area of Gaoqiao in Pudong. After completing appropriate deployments, Zou's troops launched a full-scale offensive at 8:00 AM on the 22nd. The officers and soldiers were in high spirits. The commander, a local leader with extensive experience in fighting bandits, personally led the charge at the front line. The bandit army put up fierce resistance, but ultimately, due to the extraordinary bravery of our soldiers, they were largely annihilated in an overwhelming offensive like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The remnant bandits fled in disarray, unable to form ranks. Dozens of important strongholds in the southeastern area of Gaoqiao, including Qujiazhai, Chenwang Sanzhai, Chenjiazhai, and the Xiyancangqiao area, were all captured in one fell swoop, creating one of the most astonishing scenes since the start of the Battle of Shanghai. The commander is currently leading his troops to pursue and suppress the fleeing bandits and is engaged in combat with bandit reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military Dispatch: A telephone call from the front at 2:00 PM on the 22nd stated: (1) The bandits who have invaded Pudong have suffered heavy casualties due to our counterattacks in recent days. Since approximately 2:00 AM on the 21st, reinforcements have been advancing towards our front lines at Lujiazhai, Chenjiadang, and Yangjiazhai (all located southwest of Gaoqiao Town). Our defending forces bravely counterattacked, engaging in fierce fighting throughout the night. After dawn, the bandits repeatedly launched fierce attacks using human wave tactics more than ten times. Our defending forces, relying on intense firepower, inflicted extremely painful blows on the attacking bandits under the combined operations of the naval and air forces. By noon yesterday (the 22nd), the bandits' offensive had been thwarted due to heavy casualties. Our defending forces launched a full-scale offensive, capturing over 200 bandits, seizing one 82-4 cannon, over 20 light machine guns, and a large quantity of other war spoils. It is estimated that the bandits suffered a large number of casualties throughout the day due to attacks and bombings by our naval and air forces.</p>
<p>(2) In the southeastern area of Yuepu, bandits advanced towards our Yangjiazhai positions at around 6:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd). Our defending forces were prepared and immediately gave them a head-on blow. After their attempt to advance was thwarted, the bandits retreated. Our army did not pursue.</p>
<p>(3) The bandits facing Liuhang have been severely battered by our defending forces. The strength of a certain bandit unit has been virtually eliminated. The remnant bandits, aware of the extraordinary bravery of our defending forces, have not dared to act rashly in recent days. Therefore, the war situation on that line has been quite quiet. Our strong forces are currently sweeping and suppressing the area and strengthening fortifications in preparation to inflict even greater blows on the bandits.</p>
<p>(4) Xu Fuzeng, a communication soldier of the bandit army in the Pudong area, and soldiers Fang Zhengcai and Cui Qishun, along with more than ten others, were originally soldiers captured by the bandits during the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. Unwilling to be driven by the bandits, they defected with their weapons after our army's political warfare personnel shouted to them from the front lines. According to them, two bandit armies invaded Pudong this time,妄想attempting to open up a corridor to the Wusongkou area. However, they were fiercely attacked by our loyal and calm defending forces for days, and their attempt failed. They suffered heavy losses and their morale is extremely low.</p>
<p>(5) Last night, more than ten soldiers, including Ouyang Bo and Cao Xianmin, machine gunners from a certain bandit army's mountain artillery battalion, defected to our army with their weapons. These soldiers were all captured during the retreat from Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Qibao Line in Southwestern Shanghai; Localized Engagements in Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military Dispatch: A telephone call from the front at 10:00 PM on the 22nd stated that approximately 400 bandits in Qibao attempted to attack our main positions several times yesterday (the 22nd) under cover of intense artillery fire. A certain unit of our defending forces bravely counterattacked, repelling the invading bandits one by one. Our southern main positions are secure due to strong forces and brave soldiers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military Dispatch: A telephone call from the Yuepu front at 8:00 PM on the 22nd stated that there was no major fighting yesterday (the 22nd) on the lines of Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang. There were only localized small-scale engagements. We took the opportunity to strengthen fortifications in order to wait for an opportunity to inflict a severe blow on the bandits again.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters issued a battle report at 12:00 AM on the 22nd:</p>
<p>(1) On the Qibao line in southwestern Shanghai, which had been quiet for many days, fierce localized fighting broke out again after 8:00 PM on the 21st. A bandit unit of over 2,000, with eight small cannons, launched a fierce attack on the forward defensive line of our advanced positions. The defending forces bravely fought back, engaging in fierce fighting for five hours. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and their attempt failed. They then urgently increased reinforcements in an attempt to make a final struggle. Our army adopted mobile tactics, luring the incoming bandits to the main positions. Infantry and artillery simultaneously concentrated their fire, counterattacking. By approximately 4:00 AM on the 22nd, the bandits had suffered over half their forces in casualties. Our defending forces' reserve units also outflanked the enemy's rear, cooperating in an encirclement attack. Currently, the remaining bandit units are being surrounded and annihilated by us.</p>
<p>(2) At approximately 3:00 AM on the 22nd, our Lujiazhai forces east of Zhoujiadu encountered over 300 invading bandits. Fierce fighting lasted until approximately 6:00 AM. The bandits suffered over 60 dead or wounded and retreated to their original positions.</p>
<p>(3) Over 1,000 bandits between Luqiao and Laozhai west of Yuepu made contact with our defending forces' outposts at 2:00 AM on the 22nd. Fighting continued until approximately 5:00 AM and has not yet ceased. According to reports, the National Army in that area has been resting and replenishing for the past three days, and their morale is very high. Positive battle results are expected.</p>
<p>(4) On the Yanghang front, our army dispatched an elite unit on a mobile offensive on the night of the 21st, engaging over 2,000 bandits northwest of Yanghang. The bandit army responded hastily in the dim light of night. After offering slight resistance, they retreated in disarray along the entire line. Our army, having accomplished its mission, safely returned to its original positions. There was also sporadic fighting on the Liuhang line on the 21st. The defending forces continue to maintain a favorable posture, confronting the bandits.</p>
<h3>Various Industries in the City Respond; Host War Heroes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Since the start of the Battle of Shanghai, the war situation has been extremely fierce. Fortunately, our army, navy, and air force officers and soldiers have fought bravely, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's attacks. Commander-in-Chief Tang, in order to honor the brave officers and soldiers who have been suppressing bandits, has established a "Heroes' Hall" at the International Hotel since May 20th, inviting tradesmen from the combat, photography, and hair dressing industries who have contributed to bandit suppression. Moved by righteous indignation, they have unanimously responded to Commander-in-Chief Tang's call, generously providing free services to the heroes to boost morale, which is of no small benefit to the nation. It is reported that starting today (the 23rd), the dance hall industry in the city will also respond. The heroes bravely sacrifice themselves to defend Shanghai. The six million conscientious and passionate citizens of Shanghai should actively respond, providing greater material and spiritual comfort to the war heroes, so that Shanghai will forever be the democratic and free Shanghai of our six million citizens.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Returns to Taipei</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] Provincial Chairman Chen Cheng of Taiwan, flew away from Guangzhou on the Tzu-Chiang special plane at 10:40 AM on the 21st and arrived in Taipei by the same plane at 6:10 PM on the 22nd. Chen did not issue any statement upon his return to Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Xi'an Has Been Evacuated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanzheng, 20th] (Delayed) The situation in Xi'an has suddenly changed. The National Army has proactively withdrawn. Communications were cut off after noon on the 20th. Many agencies retreating south have arrived in Nanzheng.</p>
<h3>Part of the Staff of the Economic Cooperation Administration in Guangzhou Relocates to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Guangzhou, 21st] The Economic Cooperation Administration announced on the 21st that a portion of its staff is temporarily relocating to Hong Kong. However, all work in Guangzhou will continue as usual. Over 15,000 tons of relief rice will be shipped to Hong Kong and Guangzhou in the coming weeks for distribution in Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Groups Returning from the Americas Initiate Donation Drive to Support the Troops; Fundraising Methods Approved in Germany Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] The Commemorative Meeting of the American Chinese Alliance held a standing committee meeting at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. In addition to resolving many important association matters, Director Chen Gunyao proposed that, considering the soldiers at the front line sincerely serve the country, shedding blood in the war of resistance, bravely fighting and repeatedly achieving victory, which is gratifying to the entire nation, this association, as a group of overseas Chinese compatriots from various parts of the Americas returning to Germany, should immediately send telegrams and raise donations to comfort the soldiers at the front line. He also telegraphed overseas Chinese compatriots in various parts of the Americas to launch a large-scale fundraising campaign to comfort the troops. The proposal was unanimously approved by the entire meeting, and fifteen comrades, including Zhu Binglin and Xi Yao, were designated as fundraisers. Chen Gunyao was appointed to be responsible for the gathering and they immediately held donation pledges. Li Huayan donated 300 yuan (Hong Kong dollars), Ye Zonglian and Yu Jingting 200 yuan each, Zhong Yulou 100 yuan, Zhao Hanyi, Li Tingyi, Chen Huanzhang, Li Yiru, Huang Wojun, and Li Minhan 50 yuan each, Wu Fengzhen 30 yuan, Li Ziping, Li Yuanlai, Li Zijing, Huang Qiwu, Chen Gunyao, and Zhou Jiesan 20 yuan each (all in Hong Kong dollars). They quickly agreed on methods and set out to launch a large-scale fundraising campaign, aiming to raise substantial donations in the shortest possible time and remit them to the front line to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Dollar Price Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 21st] The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar fell to its lowest price tonight, at HK$6.95 per US$1. Financial figures here believe the devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar is due to (1) the Hong Kong government's prohibition of free gold trading, (2) the large influx of Hong Kong dollars from China, and (3) the fact that the local people of Hong Kong are exchanging Hong Kong dollars for other foreign currencies.</p>
<h3>NT Dollar at 1 to 400; Official Gold Price in Taiwan Unchanged</h3>
<p>[China News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] The exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar against the Gold Yuan will be changed to NT$1 to 400 Gold Yuan, starting from the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] The official gold price set by the Bank of Taiwan on the 23rd (pure) is NT$12 million per market tael and NT$12 million per Taiwan tael. There is no change.</p>
<h3>Gan Jieshou Passes Through San Francisco; Flies to New York to Transfer to Washington; Says Government Has Decided to Oppose Communism to the End</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 21st] Mr. Gan Jieshou, the personal representative of Acting President Li, who is on a special mission to the United States, arrived here by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane at 4:00 PM on the 21st. Mr. Gan is scheduled to go to New York on the 21st, planning to stay for two days before visiting Washington to meet with President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson. According to Mr. Gan, his visit to the United States represents President Li's concern for overseas Chinese and aims to inform US government leaders of the latest developments in China. Since the breakdown of the Communist-Nationalist peace talks in Peiping, the government has decided to oppose Communism to the end. Acting President Li originally believed that seeking peace with the Communist Party was possible, but now he understands that the Communist Party has no sincerity for peace, so he has decided to oppose Communism to the end, until the Communist Party surrenders. He concluded that the government will definitely achieve final victory. He requested overseas Chinese in the United States to provide the government with spiritual support.</p>
<h3>Navy Launches Extensive Offensive; Pudong Seaside Bathing Beach Has Been Recovered</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Naval Headquarters announced yesterday's battle report, stating that the First Fleet of our Navy, under the personal supervision of Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, launched an extensive offensive on the previous night (the 21st) and yesterday morning (the 22nd), braving adverse weather conditions. On one hand, it proactively and fiercely attacked the bandit offensive areas in Zhoupu, Chuansha, and Gaoqiao, as well as the bandit army assembly areas in Yangjiazha, Dongku, and Xiejiazhai, using main guns supplemented by machine guns to support the land defending forces. On the other hand, it attacked bandit forces in areas such as Yuepu and Yanghang, with shelling beginning at 4:00 AM and continuing until 12:00 PM, conducting eight hours of border operations. The bandits in each attacked area suffered heavy casualties. The bandit offensive in the Chuansha and Gaoqiao areas has been thwarted. The results of this offensive were brilliant. The bandits suffered at least 5,000 casualties. Our Lianrong vessel, due to overexertion in combat, had one soldier injured in the artillery battle. Our Colonel Liu Guangkai adopted new tactics, commanding the ×× vessel, using the main guns for plowing-style firing, with great success. During the battle, we repeatedly received telegrams from the army stating that the main guns were powerful and the firing was accurate. The seaside bathing beach, previously occupied by the bandits, was recovered by the defending forces yesterday morning due to our navy's fierce shelling. This was witnessed through long-range binoculars, with the army's vanguard forces storming into the area under the powerful bombardment of the navy's firepower.</p>

<h3>Lecture at the Party Affairs Work Training Session - Full Text of Yan Xishan's Speech</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] The Party Affairs Work Cadre Training Session, hosted by the Central Party Headquarters, was held at 4 PM on the 20th in the Central Party Headquarters meeting hall. Mr. Yan Bochuan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, was invited to speak. Over a hundred people attended, and his words were earnest and to the point, earning continuous applause. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM. The full text of Mr. Yan's speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, all of you have been engaged in local work for many years and must have abundant experience. I truly have little room to offer my own opinions. However, I am grateful for your acceptance and will share my humble views for your reference.</p>
<p>Our Party bears the responsibility of governing the country and should study common goals in terms of governance principles and techniques, reaching a consensus in understanding and acting in unison. In terms of governance principles, both reason and strength must be emphasized. There is no supreme judge in the international arena; in reality, reason and strength are inseparable. Ideals are advanced through strength, and strength relies on reason. Strength without reason is bound to fail, and reason without strength cannot be advanced. Therefore, to establish a nation, it is necessary to cultivate strength and uphold reason. This cultivation of strength and upholding of reason is the principle of governance. Upholding reason is not just for external affairs; it is even more crucial internally. If only strength is considered, regardless of what is right or wrong, only focusing on what is possible, and doing it if it's possible, then it becomes unreasonable strength. Whether internally or externally, this will ultimately lead to failure. The goal of cultivating strength and upholding reason is the principle of governance. How to cultivate strength and uphold reason is the technique of governance. The technique of governance requires subjective actions to meet objective needs, like the hands of a clock turning in accordance with the Earth's rotation. If they don't align, the clock becomes useless. Similarly, the actions of politics itself must meet the needs of the people.</p>
<p>The premise of political measures must align with environmental demands. One cannot wear fur in summer or linen in winter. To ask the people to contribute money and effort, it must be suitable to their needs and their economic capacity. If the wealthy avoid contributing effort and even avoid contributing money, while the poor contribute both effort and money, then no matter how important the matter is, the people may resist. The technique of governance is to unify politics with the environment and objective reality.</p>
<p>Our Party has emphasized the technique of governance for many years. You, who are doing local work, especially emphasize completing the principle of governance with the technique of governance. The entire strength depends on creative ability for development. So-called creation means various measures that are suitable for oneself and the environment at the right time. The second is imitative ability. Imitation must be appropriate. A country without the ability to imitate is undoubtedly foolish. However, if imitation is inappropriate, it is equivalent to madness. Those who criticize poor imitators are often compared to someone who "sees a leg paralyzed and cuts off their own leg to save their life." A mad imitator without a leg ailment also cuts off his leg. Such mad imitation is inferior to the foolishness of poor imitation.</p>
<p>Since our Party came to power, it has demonstrated many creative measures. Our Party comrades should continue to enhance our creative abilities to adapt to the environment, cultivate our strength, and save us from danger. Comrades who are responsible for being close to the people are the key link between superiors and subordinates. Linking the importance of the nation and the needs of the people, allowing politics to penetrate the people, and enabling the people's strength to manifest in their struggle for survival is the sole task of comrades who bear local responsibility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many new terms in our country today come directly from Europe and America or indirectly from Japan. Their meanings often differ from the original meanings in our country. Interpretations and definitions vary. For example, realizing democracy and freedom is today's most powerful goal. What exactly does democracy govern? How does it govern? Especially in the process of realization, how to cultivate democracy, guide democracy, and protect democracy so that it can proceed smoothly? If there are no appropriate methods in the process, then the goal is to seek democratic governance, but in reality, it results in democratic chaos. During wartime, the people demand the abolition of conscription, grain requisitions, and taxes. However, the need for soldiers, funds, and grain for the war is obvious. Demanding the abolition of conscription, grain requisitions, and taxes is equivalent to demanding the cessation of warfare. In the ninth year of the Republic [1920], a compatriot from Taiwan said to me that the average annual burden per person in Taiwan was forty yuan. He asked me what the average burden per person in Shanxi was. I replied that it was four yuan per person. He said that everyone he met on the way from Shanghai and Beiping to Taiyuan said that the burden in Shanxi was heavy. This was only one-tenth of the burden on the people of Taiwan. I asked him if returning to the mainland would reduce his burden. He solemnly said: Reducing the burden is not happiness. Today, whether in a strong or a declining country, everyone must bear a heavy burden. Strong countries use the burden of the people to sustain themselves and conquer other countries. The people of a vanquished country must also bear a burden to supply the conquering country. What is heartbreaking is that the people of a vanquished country bear a heavy burden and even have no right to attend middle school. In our country, some boast of advocating the abolition of harsh taxes. In our understanding, harsh taxes should be abolished. However, what is considered harsh and what is considered miscellaneous should be examined. If we do not understand this properly and abolish harsh taxes, we will abolish the foundation for building a strong and civilized national defense, social construction, stabilizing the country, and ensuring the people's livelihood. All of these require the people to bear a burden, but it is a burden that is borne fairly and justly. It must be used to become strong and civilized. The burden should be carefully considered for stability and development. However, the people think that stability and development are later on and are everyone's needs, while the burden is personal. Reconciling this contradiction is the biggest challenge in revitalizing the country. To think that a small burden is sufficient is a hasty consideration. When I heard this, I immediately felt that it was reasonable and felt ashamed. For example, freedom is said to be a symbol of happiness for an individual and a nation, but it should be applied appropriately and have appropriate interpretations and scope. "Give me liberty, or give me death" refers to freedom within a certain scope. "Oh Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name!" The freedom beyond this scope. If one is afraid to talk about order and discipline because of freedom, then freedom can break through the happiness of communal life, hinder human progress, and tear apart human security. Comrades who lead rural work must accurately explain the meaning and scope of freedom and guide the people's actions into the orbit of freedom.</p>
<p>Our failure today is often criticized by outsiders for our corruption. For example, even if military discipline is good, the political effect is not great. We should humbly accept this and strive to improve. However, in my opinion, even if all of the above points are completely improved, we cannot resist the enemy. Because the strategy used by the enemy is a mass-based political war. They confiscate the property of the vast majority of people, buy off their so-called popular leaders, and then use terror. In a local area, they only eliminate their opponents and use terror and coercion to completely turn neutral people into a force united by common interests and survival. They blockaded their military situation and everything else, making us blind. They spread lieutenants everywhere and expanded their rationality. Watching them boast as if they were gambling with their countrymen, they grew transparent eyes. Watching them come out, it is always clear the law is magnetism. We are at war with the enemy. We do not know everything about the enemy, but the enemy knows everything about us. I attack the enemy, and most of me escapes. The enemy attacks me, using strength to strike weakness. If the Battle of Shanghai was like boats colliding, the stronger would win. The enemy's mass-based political war is like water overturning a boat. A boat cannot overcome water, and the boat will ultimately fail. Today, we must change our political strategy and our military strategy. We must organize the people. The work of organizing the people depends entirely on the efforts of the comrades who bear local responsibility. In today's struggle with the masses as the door, after fierce struggle and heated competition, the organization will become more popular, and the square art has become scientific. To organize townships, one must first organize baojia. To organize baojia, one must first organize households. To organize households, one must first investigate the life experience of each person in each household, what suffering they have experienced, and especially pay attention to what suffering they have experienced from our enemies. After a clear investigation, implement household visits. This is the first step.</p>
<p>When visiting, focus on the individual suffering of the person being visited as an entry point for winning them over. Based on this suffering, reveal the evils of society and the brutality of the enemy, and inspire their personal compassion. Also, make them feel that you are the only one who loves them, saves them, and even shed tears to show sympathy. This is the second step.</p>
<p>Then, for each person in their entire family, separately consider the mentality formed in their life experiences and their personal environmental relationships. Regarding the composition of people's experiences, such as the daughter-in-law in his family, be sure to investigate the family background of the woman's family and the life thoughts of each person. Such as the girl in his family, be sure to investigate his mother-in-law’s family’s family background and each person’s life thoughts, and estimate whether they can be won over. If they cannot be won over, how to comfort and guard against them. If they can be won over, what method to use to win them over. Whether to win over one person, or several people. How many times to win over. This is the third time. Usually, ten earnest talks can organize people who are easy to organize. People who cannot be organized by a hundred earnest talks are ultimately not easy to win over. The same ten earnest talks, ten earnest talks by one person, are not as effective as two or three people. A long earnest talk is not as effective as an earnest talk that helps people work. An earnest talk is usually loose at first, tight in the middle, and long afterward. Loose means talking once every two or three days. Tight in the middle means talking once a day, or two or three times a day. Long afterward means continuing to talk once a week for a long time after a month. The above earnest talk time should be short, and the words should be pertinent, so as not to arouse the people's boredom. If he has a special situation or a special difficulty arises, talk to him immediately, comfort him as appropriate, and investigate him from the side as appropriate. Pay attention to the reaction of himself and others. This is the fourth step.</p>
<p>The purpose of an earnest talk is not simply to understand, but to organize after understanding. Depending on the number of people in the family, organize a small family group of two or three people. Pay special attention to children, because children are enthusiastic and frank. This is the fifth step.</p>
<p>Organization is easy, leadership is difficult. After organizing, it is necessary to provide close, progressive, and constant leadership. In the leadership style, you must make people not feel that it is leadership, but care. This is the sixth step.</p>
<p>For example, after a family group is organized, and then organize baojia, there must be a work team of three to five people. In addition, the leader of the team must be enthusiastic, diligent, humble, and able to go deep into the people's families and not leave the people. One guarantee must also be a work leadership team of three to five people. The person in charge of this team should be well-trained in the short term, and must have a consistent understanding of the overall goal and consistent action in the work. Give him a higher political level and leadership ability, and combine political methods with the people's living conditions to lead his bao cadres and deploy the work of the whole guarantee. Townships must have a leadership team of five to seven people. The person in charge of this team must have undergone collective training in the province, with equal emphasis on cultural level and political level. The cultural level can be expressed in writing. The political level must have the intelligence to smash the enemy's political offensive and counterattack the enemy's political conspiracy with one's own political offensive. Be able to lead and deploy the work of cadres in the whole township, and be able to enthusiastically encourage the people of the whole township to have a political orientation towards me. This is the seventh step.</p>
<p>If we can complete this work of organizing the masses, we can heal our double blindness, remove the enemy's far-sightedness, and complete the enemy's double blindness. Make the enemy scattered. We will beat them to death. Unite and trap them to death. We avoid reality and strike at emptiness, eat the small with the big, and grow stronger every day. There is a way to do things militarily.</p>
<p>Fellow comrades have studied organizational work and have much experience. What I have said above is only based on what I have learned from my humble opinions and is for your reference.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Jiangdong Battlefield</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the defense of Greater Shanghai shifted from the Yuepu-Liuhang line to Pudong, all six million citizens of Shanghai have been paying close attention to its development. To understand the actual situation of the fighting on that front, this reporter braved the rain again on the morning of the 22nd to visit Pudong.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation of the Shanghai battle, Pudong should be the least important battlefield. This was the case during the January 28th Incident and the August 13th Incident. The reason is that for a long and narrow area like Pudong, if the opposing side arranges heavy troops in such a terrain, it is a "great taboo in military strategy." It is easy for the opponent to go down from Xin Zhuang and Minhang via Fengxian to the coast, cut off its rear supply line, and then completely surround and annihilate it. But why are the communist forces doing this today? Of course, we cannot attribute it to Chen Yi being a man of letters and not understanding major military principles. However, it is at least an undeniable military adventure.</p>
<p>Originally, Chen Yi's initial battle plan was to use elite troops to attack the Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang lines, attempting to occupy Wusongkou before the 15th, control the Huangpu River, cut off the water transportation of Greater Shanghai, and then use a "nerve offensive" to pressure the National Army into "local peace." He did not expect that the communist forces' plan would be completely crushed by the head-on blow of Liu Yuzhang's Long Victory Army. Instead, the communist forces barely occupied Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha in the first four days of the Shanghai battle. Therefore, Chen Yi changed his battle plan, believing that occupying the entire Pudong could achieve the same military result as occupying Wusongkou.</p>
<p>Originally, Chen Yi's regular army in Pudong was only the 30th Army. However, in order to carry out the above plan, he has been continuously increasing troops in Pudong in recent days. According to the materials obtained by the military, the units that have now been discovered include the 30th, 31st, 32nd, 33rd, 20th, 21st, and 35th Armies, a total of seven armies. Therefore, since the 17th, the communist forces in Pudong, which were originally a supporting attack, have now been changed to a main attack. The branch battlefield has now become the main battlefield.</p>
<p>In response to this new situation on the battlefield, the Supreme Commander of the Shanghai Battle, General Tang, in order to crush Chen Yi's military adventure, in addition to sending heavy troops to take over the defense of Pudong and strengthen the troop strength in that area, also specially transferred General Que Hanqian, the famous general who expeditioned to India and Myanmar during the War of Resistance Against Japan, to be the commander of a certain army group, responsible for commanding the fighting in that area.</p>
<p>Commander Que is also an old friend of the reporter. Although we have not seen each other for many years, his humor remains unchanged. He is from Hunan, but his tall stature leads people to believe that he is a typical northerner. Therefore, astrologers say that he is a "southerner with a northern face," so he is destined for nobility. In fact, not only his stature resembles a northerner, but also his personality is completely that of a northerner. This time, we were naturally especially happy to meet. He told us many stories about the "Liberation Army" of the communist forces in Shandong, Hebei, and other places. He said: Gaoqiao is still firmly defended by the National Army. The National Army's forward positions are about three or four li south of Gaoqiao on the Zhangjiazhai, Yangjiazhai, and Lujiazhai lines. Although the communist forces have been attacking continuously for five days, the result has only been the complete annihilation of the 30th Army. Recently, reinforcements have been continuously transferred, and although they once occupied Guijiazhai north of Donggou on the 18th, they still failed to shake our main position in the slightest.</p>
<p>At present, the National Army's defense line south of Donggou is the line from Qingning Temple in the north via Nongjia Wood Factory, Yangjing Middle School, Pudong Middle School to Zhoujiadu and its vicinity. The National Army's strength in this area is also very strong.</p>
<p>According to Chief of Staff Shen of a certain army group, he told me: On the afternoon of the 18th of this month at about 1 PM, Commander Que had just gone to the front line to direct the battle. Because the communist forces facing him were rushing fiercely towards the city ferry from Guijiazhai north of Donggou, Commander Que directed the tanks to assist the infantry in a full-scale blockade. Two seconds after he got out of his jeep, the left window of his jeep was hit by a machine gun bullet. The glass shattered into a large hole, but Que continued to supervise the battle as if nothing had happened. The enemy soldiers retreated, and the position was stabilized as a result. His courage and calmness were like this. When the reporter went this time, he also saw the jeep with the broken glass in his headquarters.</p>
<p>At his headquarters, the reporter also interviewed many prisoners of war, most of whom were from Shandong, and some were National Army soldiers who had been captured in the Huaihai Campaign and sent to the front line after training. They were covered in mud. According to them, they had not eaten a grain of rice for three days and nights in trenches full of rainwater. Their treatment was still the market price of one catty of pork per month converted into people's coupons.</p>
<p>During the six hours that the reporter stayed on the front line, it was unusually quiet. There was no shooting or artillery fire. According to Commander Que, they were changing defenses today because they had sacrificed a lot last night. Therefore, we were able to enjoy the Zhang Yu brandy that Commander Que brought back from the battle of Yantai 44 years ago in the most relaxed mood. It turned out that when the National Army recovered Yantai on October 1st of the year before last, it was his army that entered Yantai City first.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Relieving Refugees and Rescuing the Wounded</h3>
<p>The ruthless flames of war have spread to the outskirts of Shanghai. All suburbs, including Jiangwan, Dachang, Wusong, Xinshi, Zhenru, Beixinjing, Gaoqiao, Yangjing, Sisheng, Longhua, and Hongqiao, have been or will become battlefields. As a result, ordinary citizens are flocking to the urban areas, becoming homeless and destitute refugees. The city's Social Affairs Bureau has already prepared and distributed 1,000 piculs of rice to provide relief to the affected residents in the suburbs and is looking for houses in various places to accommodate them. However, the work of relieving refugees is only handled by a small number of people from the Social Affairs Bureau. Both in terms of manpower and material resources, it will feel inadequate. Therefore, we cannot but hope that social charities can stand on the position of humanitarianism and come out to assist the society in shouldering this arduous task.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Red Cross Society of China, the Red Swastika Society, the Roman Catholic Church, the Christian Church, the YMCA of China, the Children's Welfare Association, the Buddhist Association, Renji Hall, and other charitable organizations, hometown associations, and public welfare groups have jointly launched an "Shanghai United Relief Committee," and prominent Shanghai figures such as Yan Huiqing, Ben Sihao, and Huang Hanzhi are in charge of it. Based on the past situation of relief work in Shanghai, this "United Relief Organization" will surely seek welfare for thousands and millions of refugees and will surely be trusted by the six million citizens of Shanghai. In the process of carrying out its mission of relieving refugees, no matter what needs there are, citizens will ultimately be able to jump forward and contribute, truly achieving "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength."</p>
<p>Shanghai is a commercial and industrial city. The traditional spirit of Shanghai citizens, in a nutshell, lies in the word "righteousness." Regardless of the social strata, they can fully recognize the true meaning of "mutual assistance" and "cooperation." The most popular saying, "The poor rely on the rich, and the rich rely on the poor," contains infinite meaning. In the past fifteen years, Shanghai has suffered many disasters: the January 28th Incident of 1932, the August 13th Shanghai Battle of 1937, and the December 8th Pacific War of 1941. Each time the storm struck, it caused Shanghai citizens to live and die. Fortunately, Shanghai citizens all have the spirit of sharing the same boat in a storm and deeply understand the great meaning of "mutual assistance" and "cooperation," which ultimately allowed Shanghai to turn danger into safety and transform peril into peace. There is no need to say anything else, just in terms of refugee relief, the strict organization, the large scope, the large number of people accommodated, and the combination of relief and education are beyond the reach of any city. This is a manifestation of the traditional spirit of Shanghai citizens and also a glorious record of Shanghai citizens. Although the nature of this unfortunate war disaster is different from the past, we should still strive to relieve refugees from a humanitarian standpoint. Therefore, we would like to offer the following suggestions for refugee relief work.</p>
<p>First, relieving refugees is a sacred cause for the six million citizens of Shanghai. Everyone has a responsibility. Regardless of gender, regardless of wealth, they must fulfill their duty as a citizen. In other words, we hope that the six million citizens of Shanghai can truly reach the point of "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength." Fundraising is the responsibility of wealthy citizens, and the implementation of relief work should rely on the enthusiastic service of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>Second, as the flames of war increasingly press towards the urban area, stray bullets and other unfortunate incidents are inevitable. Therefore, our so-called relief work, in addition to relieving the homeless refugees in the suburbs, must also shoulder the work of rescuing wounded citizens. This is work related to medical services, and we cannot but hope that the city's doctors, nurses, and major hospitals will do their best.</p>
<p>Third, Shanghai is an international city. Among today's vast refugee population, there is no shortage of people from all over the world. Among those who unfortunately suffer casualties in the future, there will naturally also be expatriates from various countries. Therefore, we should also ask the World Red Cross Society, which has a good reputation in the international community, to step forward, participate in the work, relieve the refugees in Shanghai, and rescue the unfortunate wounded people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In short, doing good is the greatest joy. Saving people from suffering is already the noblest and most sacred virtue of mankind, let alone in this time of war and danger, sacrificing oneself for the group and using one's surplus material and human resources to help others is what everyone in Shanghai is willing to do today. We hope that the six million citizens of Shanghai can participate in this great work of relieving refugees and rescuing the wounded.</p>

<h3>The True Picture of Peace in Beiping</h3>
<p>Continued from page 4 of the 21st</p>
<p>According to the Xinhua News Agency, the two celebration rallies were representative of Beiping residents' revelry. However, anyone with a slightly more objective perspective will tell you that Beiping residents' revelry was on January 1st, not February 3rd, and especially not February 12th. The so-called welcome and celebration were nothing more than the Party singing its own praises.</p>
<p>(8) So That's How It Is</p>
<p>Since Beiping changed hands, due to years of domestic and foreign troubles, coupled with the corruption and incompetence of some officials, the government had many shortcomings that made people dissatisfied. It was indeed difficult for all facilities to satisfy people's desires. People always tend to place their hopes in another world, especially one that is not easy to see. Many people imagined it as a perfect paradise. Furthermore, with the clever propaganda of preachers, it further attracted people's hearts. But when they truly arrived in this paradise and saw what it was like, they realized that the so-called paradise was "so that's how it is." The fortunate ladies who were able to reach paradise even wanted to sing "The Fairy Maiden Longs for the Mortal World."</p>
<p>Before local peace was implemented in Beiping, many people had imagined the realization of peace to be very satisfactory. But after peace was realized, they discovered a series of "so that's how it is." Here is a brief description:</p>
<p>(1) The people who advocated peace, their ideal was that after peace, the first step would be to establish a joint organization, equivalent to a coalition government. This coalition government would be the highest authority in North China. Although the committee members were initially three from the Kuomintang and four from the Communist Party, the Communist Party immediately used democracy and freedom to call for expanding the foundation in the future and welcoming participation from all parties and factions. Therefore, at the beginning of the signing of the peace agreement, it was widely rumored that ××× was actively organizing the Democratic Freedom Party, preparing to participate in the coalition government. But even though they knew that after the establishment of the joint organization, it would be silent and ineffective in the Zhongnanhai area, the administrative system of the other side was such that the highest authority was the Chinese Communist Party, with one party acting on behalf of the central government. Below that were the six "liberated areas" of North China, Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central Plains, and Qiongya. Each area had a people's government. The chairman of the North China "liberated area" people's government was Dong Biwu, and all the committee members were Communists. Not only were other parties and factions not allowed to participate, but the Kuomintang, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and all reactionary parties and groups were also to be disbanded, and the so-called reactionary elements were to be arrested. The Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, a mouthpiece of the Communist Party, after receiving Zhang Yijin's house on Xisi Beiwai Street, hung up a sign and openly carried out activities. Who knew that in less than three days, the sign was taken down, and the house was occupied by the garrison command. If this is the treatment of a mouthpiece, one can imagine what it is like for other parties. Not being allowed to participate in the government was already unexpected, but what was most surprising was that Zhang Yinwu, who advocated peace the earliest, was arrested as a military intelligence agent. Xu Huidong, who worked hardest to achieve peace, was called the chief culprit of the "July 5th Incident" and detained. He Siyuan, who knocked on the door of peace, was called a peace broker and is now at home studying democracy. They are discarding the bridge after crossing the river, cooking the hound after the hare is dead. How ungrateful can one be! After the signing of the peace agreement, on January 31st, there was still a plane flying to Suiyuan. On the lunar New Year's Day, I went to pay a New Year's visit to Huidong. I earnestly advised him to fly away, but he argued confidently at the time, believing that regarding the "July 5th Incident," first: even if the proposal was wrong, it was proposed by Ding Chunan, and he neither seconded it nor participated in the vote, so what did it have to do with him? Second: the students surrounded his residence and wanted to beat him, and he fled because he was afraid of being beaten, so that shouldn't be considered a crime. Third: regardless of who fired the first shot, the military had Chen Jicheng and the police had Yang Qingzhi, and even if you pushed the responsibility onto a hundred people, it wouldn't reach him. Moreover, everyone knew that he worked hardest to achieve peace, and even if the Communist Party was unreasonable, they wouldn't harm him. Who knew that before long, on the very day that the four peace elders from Shanghai arrived in Beiping, the Communist Party had already mobilized students to hunt him down? The most ridiculous thing was that because Huidong was the sixth child in his family, acquaintances called him "Sixth Brother" and called his one and only wife "Sixth Sister-in-law," but the People's Daily insisted on referring to our toothless old "Sixth Sister-in-law" as his sixth concubine. I really don't know what that meant.</p>
<p>Zhang Yinwu advocated the philosophy of Yan Yuan and Li Gong, and founded the Sicu School. The school had military training in peacetime, and during the War of Resistance Against Japan, it engaged in guerrilla warfare. The school had guns, as everyone knew. Who knew that the Communist Party wouldn't remember his contribution to advocating peace the earliest and instead used the pretext of having guns to falsely accuse him of being a KMT agent and arrest him. Heaven knows, anyone with political common sense wouldn't believe that Zhang Yinwu was a KMT agent. I think even the Communist Party themselves wouldn't believe their own words, but they still arrested him under a false pretense. What an injustice!</p>
<p>The story of He Siyuan's efforts to achieve peace has been described in detail before. After the Communist army entered the city, he disappeared and lived in seclusion to recover from his injuries. At first, I only knew that the People's Daily was coldly mocking him, saying that he and Gan Jiehou were both peace brokers for Li Zongren. Later, it was published in the Xinmin Daily that the authorities were sending him many books on Marxism-Leninism, ordering him to reflect on his mistakes behind closed doors and study democracy. His whereabouts were known, he was originally imprisoned at home. (To be continued)</p>

The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and France held another secret meeting on the morning of the 22nd, before the opening of the Foreign Ministers Conference, to review the positions of the three Western powers in this Foreign Ministers Conference. An official from the British Embassy revealed today that the three foreign ministers, Bevin, Acheson, and Schuman, held secret talks for two hours this morning at the French Foreign Ministry, and have reached a complete agreement on the positions to be adopted by the three countries in the Foreign Ministers Conference. News from Moscow this afternoon showed that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, after arriving in Paris yesterday, continued to maintain contact with General Chuikov, commander of the Soviet forces in Germany, and listened to the developments in Berlin and Germany at any time. It is generally expected that although Vyshinsky will make some concessions at this Foreign Ministers Conference, he will also clearly express the Soviet Union's final position, beyond which no further changes will be allowed. Paris is filled with an atmosphere of tense anticipation today. Parisian newspapers warmly welcomed Vyshinsky, placing a photo of Vyshinsky's arrival in Paris in a prominent position on the front page.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 21st Dispatch] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will be held at 4:00 PM on Monday at the Palais de Marbre in Paris.

<h3>West Berlin Labor Unrest Expands; Strikers Clash with Anti-Strikers; Gunfire Erupts, Over 500 Injured</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin 22nd Dispatch] Soviet Zone German police fired on railway strikers on the morning of the 22nd, injuring at least five people. At the same time, the all-day riots of the 21st reached a climax again. Over 500 people have been injured in clashes between strikers and Communist Party-led anti-strikers in the Berlin East and West Zone German police conflicts.</p>
<p>Due to the strike by 15,000 railway workers in West Berlin, elevated railway traffic in and out of Berlin has been virtually cut off. The shooting incidents occurred in two places. When Communist Party-led anti-strikers and armored Soviet Zone German police attempted to occupy the Nilu-Kolin station and clashed with strikers, more than 20 shots were fired, injuring at least five people. West Zone strikers attacked the Wunxi station, which was blockaded by anti-strikers and Soviet Zone German police, at midnight, but were unsuccessful. Casualties are still unknown. Both sides wielded guns, hoes, iron bars, and electric whips. However, it is said that only Communist Party-led anti-strikers fired shots. At the Nilu-Kolin station, anti-strikers occupied it after a bloody battle at one point, but were later driven out by a counterattack by strikers.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin 21st Dispatch] After the major conflict caused by the Berlin railway strike tonight, Soviet officials, Soviet Zone police, and the pro-Communist "Free German Youth" have occupied three of the forty stations in West Berlin. In the remaining stations, they are still guarded by independent trade union members, who do not allow Soviet Zone personnel to take over. The West Berlin stations are also managed by the Soviet Railway Bureau. The employees are striking because they are demanding to be paid in West German marks. 12,000 people are participating. During the conflict between employees and communists, some people fired shots into the air, and a train was burned.</p>
<p>Soviet Transportation Minister Injured in American Zone</p>
<p>Soviet Transportation Minister General Kvashmin was besieged by the crowd at the Heimendalas station in the American Zone and slightly injured. He was later rescued by West Zone police, who also arrested 22 of the ringleaders of the incidents at each station. The Berlin radio station controlled by the Soviet side stated that employees had destroyed several sections of the track between Potsdam and Vaernzai. Employees stated that the strike would not hinder trains from West Germany from going to Berlin, but by 6:00 PM, only one British and one American military train, and one train from the Ruhr, had arrived in Berlin. Brigadier General Horlai, commander of the American forces in Berlin, stated that if the actions of the railway police controlled by the Soviet side go beyond the scope of democracy or cannot maintain order, the West Berlin police will take over the stations. The American military will not take action unless the unrest expands and involves Allied personnel. An official from the Transportation Department of the British military government also stated that the labor unrest could be resolved quickly if the Soviet military government simply paid employees' wages in the legal currency of the West Zone—West German marks.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin 21st Dispatch] Some of the striking railways in West Berlin resumed operation tonight, guarded by Soviet soldiers on board. One of them entered the American military zone, and the other entered the French military zone. Machine guns were mounted on the roofs of the cars. The clashes between strikers and police throughout the day resulted in 500 injuries. Workers cursed Soviet railway managers and threw stones. Communist guards at the Schohorniburg station released police dogs and bit one of the strikers. The tracks of the Liedanlat elevated railway station were dug up. At the same time, American and British planes continued air transport today to ensure the daily supply of 8,000 tons of food and fuel to West Berlin.</p>
<h3>If German Police Cannot Control the Situation, the American Military Will Take Action</h3>
<p>Announcement by American Military Commander Horlai</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin 21st Dispatch] Brigadier General Horlai, commander of the American forces in Berlin, told reporters today that the strike by railway workers in West Berlin is unfortunate, as it is taking place at the time of the Four-Power Conference. However, he acknowledged that workers have the right to take strike action, so the American military government has not ordered the strike to be stopped, but has pointed out to the trade union leaders that the Four-Power talks are about to begin. The trade union leaders have promised not to hinder traffic after the blockade is lifted. Horlai continued that wage disputes should be resolved between employers and employees themselves, so the American military government has consistently adopted a policy of non-interference, unless conflicts occur that the German police cannot control, in which case the American military will mobilize. Horlai also stated that the West Zone trade unions and the Berlin City Council have both attempted negotiations, but have been rejected by the railway authorities controlled by the Communist Party. The railway authorities are attempting to use more than 5,000 "yellow" Communist youths to restore operations under the protection of the police in the East Zone and have announced that they will shoot and kill anyone who prevents trains from operating.</p>
<h3>East-West German Trade Negotiations Have Fallen into Destruction</h3>
<p>The American Side Indicates Agreement Was Almost Reached</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin 21st Dispatch] Hainfrau, chairman of the East German Economic Commission, told reporters here today who held Soviet military licenses that the talks between representatives of the East and West German Economic Commissions on restoring inter-regional trade have reached a stalemate. The breakdown of the talks was due to the West German authorities' unwillingness to remove various restrictions that are harmful to inter-regional trade. These talks began in Berlin earlier this week, but the West German representatives soon left for Frankfurt, so no results were obtained and no date for continued negotiations was set.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin 21st Dispatch] Hayes, chief of the American forces in Germany, told reporters today that financial experts from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have almost reached an agreement at the final meeting.

<h3>Former American Secretary of Defense Forrestal Falls to His Death; He Was Being Treated in a Hospital for Nervous Fatigue</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 22nd Dispatch] The Department of the Navy officially announced today that former Secretary of Defense Forrestal committed suicide by jumping from his hospital room at the Bethesda Naval Hospital near Washington at 2:00 AM today.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington 22nd Dispatch] Former Secretary of Defense Forrestal committed suicide by jumping from a building this morning, at the age of 57. Forrestal had been receiving treatment for nervous fatigue at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland since April 2nd, but unexpectedly took his own life. According to the hospital, Forrestal climbed out of the window of a neighboring room and jumped at 2:00 AM this morning. The hospital is over ten stories high, and Forrestal's room was on the top floor. Forrestal was born in Beacon, New York, in February 1892, and studied at Dartmouth College and Princeton University, working his way through school. During World War I, he joined the Navy as a private and transferred to the Air Force. In 1918, he joined the Navy General Staff. In 1940, he became Undersecretary of the Navy, and four years later, he succeeded Knox as Secretary of the Navy, making great contributions to the construction of a large navy. Forrestal embraced talent-ism, and sometimes removed naval generals from important positions and re-used civil servants. In 1947, the three departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were merged, and Forrestal became Secretary of Defense, until he recently resigned. It is said that his nervous fatigue was caused by overwork during and after the war.</p>
<h3>The Philippine Representative to the Korean Commission Opposes American Troop Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Seoul 22nd Dispatch] Philippine Representative Renna of the United Nations Korean Commission stated on the 22nd that his delegation firmly opposes the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. Renna made the above statement at a luncheon hosted by the South Korean Foreign Minister. He was speaking on behalf of the Philippine delegation, not on behalf of the Korean Commission. Renna stated: "I oppose the withdrawal of American troops because the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the Korean issue clearly states that the United States and the Soviet Union should withdraw their occupation forces simultaneously. As a member of the United Nations Korean Commission, I have always been denied entry into North Korea, so I cannot know whether the Soviet Union has already withdrawn its troops. Under these circumstances, I cannot agree that after the American troops withdraw, the Republic of Korea will be free from attack." The diplomatic community is not surprised by Renna's statement, as it is generally believed that the Philippine and Korean governments are working closely together on the proposed Pacific Pact. At the same time, both countries hope that the United States can assume the same obligations to the Atlantic region to support the Pacific region.</p>

<h3>American Newspaper Comments on Japanese Reparations: Allied Nations Should Abandon Demanding Reparations from Japan</h3>
<p>[New American Agency, Washington, 18th] American newspapers are commenting on the issue of Japanese reparations, continuing to support the American policy announced last week by Major General McCoy, the U.S. representative to the Far Eastern Commission. The Washington Post said: "America's sudden and seemingly somewhat arbitrary action to cease demanding reparations from Japan coincides with the views expressed by the Herald Tribune as early as February 2, 1947. At that time, it was already clear that if the Allied nations could not agree on a method for claiming and distributing Japanese reparations, Japan would never be able to recover. The eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission has been in constant dispute over Japanese reparations since its establishment in 1945. The main disputant is, of course, the Soviet Union, which thoroughly plundered Manchuria, including Japanese industries there. This is the bill for the Soviet Union's one week of fighting in Manchuria, but Moscow refuses to disclose the names of the reparations it seized. In addition, there were other things obtained from Japan, totaling a reduction of 3 billion U.S. dollars in Japanese assets abroad. Regarding formal reparations, the claimant nations remain deadlocked, although the United States has repeatedly tried to break this impasse. Initially, any demands by the United States were criticized, followed by the shipment of some reparations items (including a certain amount of machinery) to some claimant nations as a preliminary solution to the reparations issue. However, the total amount of reparations and the method of distribution remain impossible to determine. Based on these and other reasons, there is an urgent need to resolve the entire reparations issue. In addition to occupation costs, the United States spends 300 to 400 million U.S. dollars annually on the Japanese economy to supply the Japanese people with essential goods. This subsidy creates a dependency mentality among the Japanese people that is difficult to remove and does not encourage Japan to try to become economically self-sufficient. Furthermore, removing more of Japan's productive equipment would only reduce Japan's ability to achieve economic self-sufficiency, which is a major goal of the occupation. Requiring the removal of Japanese production equipment to some claimant nations in the Far East may not be of much help to those countries either. The heavy industrial equipment that Japan has relatively "surplus" is very expensive to move, and is often useless without secondary processing equipment, which these claimant nations do not have. As for the light industrial equipment that they can use more easily, it cannot be considered surplus for Japan's peacetime needs if Japan is to support itself in world trade. Because Japan and Britain must import food and raw materials while exporting manufactured goods to pay for imports. Japan's economic recovery as a trading nation is beneficial not only for Japanese and American taxpayers but also for the entire Far East, because the recovery of Far Eastern trade can eliminate the current chaos and prevent the spread of communism." The Chicago Daily Tribune said: "This new policy is clearly correct and should have been adopted long ago... At a time when the world needs production, we are allowing production equipment to be dismantled, but the machinery will inevitably be damaged during relocation, and a great deal of production will be lost before new factories are established in new locations overseas, and there will be even more losses due to a lack of technical personnel to control the machinery... Our government has finally adopted a policy that should have been adopted long ago." The Indianapolis News declared: The U.S. central demand for reparations resolution "is based on strictly practical considerations." The newspaper cited the Far Eastern Commission's failure to agree on a reparations catalog, the U.S. subsidy to the Japanese economy, the division of reparations already taken by the Soviet Union in Manchuria, and the fact that reparations obtained by China would fall into the hands of the Communists. The newspaper added: "Unfortunately, the Philippines will also be deprived of reparations for Japan's wanton plunder and destruction. But according to a comment in the New York Times, even under these circumstances, "it is very clear: if the Philippines continues to be with the United States, which has been relieved of its burden to Japan, and occupies a sound position in a healthy Pacific economy (which must have a solvent Japan), then the Philippines will benefit more than from an economically distressed United States or a bankrupt Japan. Therefore, retaining the industry previously designated by Japan for reparations to the four countries means trying to make Japan economically self-sufficient as soon as possible. This is a sudden change in policy, but this change should be based on a sound principle: that the world must have a healthy society and a healthy economy if it is to enjoy democracy and peace." The Washington Daily News said: "There is a very good reason for ending the demand for reparations for war losses from Japan, and that is that the reparations that Japan will pay in the future will be taken out of the pockets of the United States, not paid by Japan. The Allied nations have already obtained a lot of compensation from Japan, and the burden we bear is also considerable. We can no longer pay the remaining reparations claims for Japan. No one can profit from war. The cost and destruction of huge wealth must be treated as a total loss. This is the situation in which we do not demand reparations from Japan. The question is how to establish an economy in the Pacific region that allows people to live their own lives and live with others, so as to prove that the salvation of mankind lies in peace, cooperation, rather than military, economic and political oppression.</p>
<h3>Today's Iran</h3>
<p>Special Translation by Our Newspaper's Editorial Office</p>
<p>Since the lifting of the Berlin Blockade, the tense situation in Europe has gradually eased, and the world's attention has gradually shifted to Asia. Iran is an ancient country in the East, occupying a strategic position. Historically, it has long been a place of contention for foreign powers, and today it has become the focus of the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the Western bloc. This article is translated and published for the benefit of our readers, so as to gain a general understanding of the importance of the Iranian issue.</p>
<p>The Cold War in Iran has existed since ancient times, not just today.</p>
<p>Iran is the richest country in the Middle East, with a 1,500-mile border with the Soviet Union. It is the bridgehead of the Persian Gulf, the entrance to the Suez Canal leading to the Indian Ocean, and the necessary route for Eastern merchants in ancient times. In its long history of 6,000 years, Iran has been constantly threatened by foreign invasions. Today, Iran is facing the pressure from the West in a world where the Atlantic and Soviet spheres of influence confront each other, and it is bravely and stubbornly maintaining its independence.</p>
<p>Soviet troops have occupied and then withdrawn, without establishing a permanent puppet government, which is only true of Iran in the world. This is due to Iran's political maneuvering and the moral pressure of the United Nations. But this has caused even more disputes.</p>
<p>An Iranian official explained Iran's diplomatic position, saying: "The United States' policy in the Middle East is what we are most worried about. Greece and Turkey have consolidated their positions with American military aid, which puts even more pressure on Iran."</p>
<p>However, Iran is situated between two major spheres of influence, always maintaining its independent position, and has never formally asked the United States to provide military guarantees. However, the Iranian government has hired American military missions to train its army and gendarmerie, and has obtained surplus supplies from the United States.</p>
<p>However, that military training mission has strengthened the threat of Soviet aggression and occupation. Iran has long been plagued by the hot and cold wars of successive Soviet governments. After the Soviet Communist Party came to power, it signed a treaty of friendship with Iran in 1921 to eradicate Tsarist aggression. But that treaty contained a provision stipulating that if White Russian counter-revolutionary troops gathered on Iranian soil, the Soviet government had the right to send troops into Iranian territory to take necessary self-defense measures.</p>
<p>The threat feared by the Lenin government disappeared, but the Soviets found that clause very convenient for implementing their policies. That clause was first used in 1941, when Soviet and British troops occupied Iran, using the country as a bridge for transporting lend-lease materials to the Soviet Union via the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>In 1946, weeks after the United Nations deadline expired, Soviet troops were advised to withdraw from Iran, with the promise of oilfield concessions. They believed that a puppet government had been established in Azerbaijan Province, the largest province in Iran.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Iranian Prime Minister Sultani made a splash by sending troops to fight the pro-communist troops for a day, reoccupying Azerbaijan Province. At the same time, Sultani's hand-picked parliament unanimously voted to deny the promise to grant oilfield concessions to the Soviet Union. Now, the leaders of Azerbaijan Province who escaped the noose are under Soviet protection, while Soviet influence in Azerbaijan Province has declined to an unprecedented level.</p>
<p>When Soviet influence gradually recovered, it launched an offensive, accusing the American military training mission of trying to turn Iran into a strategic base threatening the Soviet Union. Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Sachinikov, submitted notes to the Iranian government on January 31, March 24, and April 8, 1948, stating that the Soviet Union believed that the 1921 Treaty of Friendship had been violated, and the Soviet government invoked the treaty to freely occupy Iran in order to protect its southern border. Iran refuted the Soviet accusations as "baseless," condemned its actions as "interference in Iran's internal affairs," and pointed out that the obligations of Iran and the Soviet Union under the United Nations Charter had invalidated the occupation provisions of the 1921 Treaty.</p>
<p>Since the threatening attacks from Moscow Radio, Iran's closure of Soviet consulates in various places, and the sporadic conflicts that occurred along the border, Iran's Cold War has become hotter day by day.</p>
<p>Tehran officials have warned against equating such trivial matters with major issues. Iran closed the Soviet consulates because the Soviet Union refused to grant reciprocal privileges. Border conflicts have been occurring continuously in sparsely populated deserts for fifty years.</p>
<p>Iran is watching the movements of the policies of the world powers, while Iran has its own problems, such as establishing domestic political unity and eliminating the country's extreme poverty, which need to be resolved.</p>

<h3>The Supply of Vegetables in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Special Article by Our Newspaper] In the morning, housewives or maids, carrying baskets to the vegetable market, ask about the prices of vegetables, and are surprised to say: Yesterday it was only so much money per catty, how is it so expensive today? When they meet their neighbors' little sisters, they also discuss the daily rise in prices. They can already hear the gunfire, but they are still so black-hearted. They know that the approaching gunfire is causing vegetable prices to rise, but what is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Shanghai is a large industrial and commercial metropolis, densely populated. Even if there are scattered open spaces, they are small in area, where there is land that can be used to grow vegetables and fruits. Commerce is based on industry, and industry is based on agriculture. Although Shanghai has developed into a metropolis with five to six million people, it is still inseparable from the countryside. The raw materials of factories are mostly agricultural products. The food for millions of citizens also depends on the countryside, and even the vegetables for meals must rely on the supply and transport from the countryside.</p>
<p>Shanghai has six million citizens. On average, each person consumes half a catty of vegetables a day, which requires 30,000 dan. Where do these 30,000 dan of vegetables come from? Most of them come from the neighboring counties of Shanghai, such as Huangdu, Pudong, Kunshan, Songjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, Pinghu, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. Vegetables are transported from these places to supply the consumption of Shanghai citizens. For example, green vegetables and snow vegetables come from Huangdu, yellow sprouts come from Chongming Beisha, cabbage is mostly from Pudong and Chongming, and potatoes also come from Huangdu, radishes are transported from Wuxi and Suzhou, and bamboo shoots from Hangzhou and Ningbo are also sources for Shanghai. Further afield, cabbage from Hebei and Shandong, garlic from the Northeast, and peas from Guangdong are also transported to Shanghai for supply.</p>
<p>In the past, the Old Zha Gate Bridge, the New Zha Gate Bridge, the Bund, Caojiadu, etc., were all distribution centers for vegetables. The shops on both sides were all local produce shops, and even the sidewalks on both sides of the road were used as temporary vegetable storage areas. Boats full of vegetables were transported from various places to Shanghai and concentrated there. Some were directly bought by the local produce shops, and some local produce shops acted as intermediaries, reselling to vegetable vendors and collecting a certain commission.</p>
<p>Before dawn every day, it was the most prosperous time for local produce shops to do business. It was bustling and noisy, and that was when vegetable vendors went to wholesale. Vegetables, baskets, rickshaws, rubber-wheeled carts, trucks, and self-propelled carts were squeezed together, bumping east and west. By seven or eight o'clock, people slowly decreased, and the noise gradually subsided. There was another market in the afternoon, which was sometimes more lively than in the morning, and that was when vegetable vendors were wholesaling for sale tomorrow. Because after vegetable vendors wholesale vegetables, they also have to select, sort, and trim them. The yellow leaves of green vegetables must be removed, although the weight is reduced by 20%, they can sell for more money. For fruits and the like, they must also be selected according to size, because their value is inconsistent. The basket of vegetables must also be sprinkled with some water to maintain its fresh color, so as not to sell for a low price tomorrow.</p>
<p>During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, in order to achieve the goal of controlling the market and collecting materials, they were not willing to let go of even these agricultural products. The Central Market was established at the northern end of the New Garbage Bridge, divided into departments such as preserved meat, local produce, northern goods, eggs, medicinal materials, wine, Chinese paper, firewood and charcoal, fuel, and asphalt. Branch markets were set up in various places such as Maigen Road, Limalu in the Nanshi, Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, Xie Bridge, Jiangwan, Pudong, and Tushanwan, to complete their control objectives, forcing the local produce shops in the area of ​​New Zha Gate Bridge and Old Zha Gate Bridge to do business there. Farmers were also forced to let the enemy control the harvest they had exchanged with their blood and sweat. The market charged 26% of the profits for transactions, which resulted in higher vegetable prices. After the victory, the Central Market, like other enemy and puppet organizations, was taken over by the municipal government. It was initially planned to improve it, continue to operate it, and rename it Shanghai Agricultural Products Market; however, it was suspended due to a proposal by the City Council. After the suspension, the local produce shops felt inconvenient to do business, so they established a Vegetable Transportation and Sales Joint Transportation Market to replace it.</p>
<p>The vegetables needed by Shanghai's six million citizens every day are not produced in Shanghai, but rely on the supply from other ports; therefore, transportation is the main task of maintaining the source. In peacetime, if it rains for several days in a row, or on days with heavy snow in winter, the arrival of goods is scarce, and the price of goods will also rise. As the war approaches Shanghai, the transportation lines to the outside world are reduced, the source of vegetables cannot be smooth, and supply falls short of demand, naturally prices will rise even higher. In the past few wars, although the currency value was still very stable, prices would also rise by two or three times. Now, on the one hand, the arrival of goods is scarce, and on the other hand, the currency value has fallen, how can prices not jump especially high?</p>
<p>In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when Shanghai was reduced to an isolated island, vegetables from various places could not be transported into the Shanghai urban area, and residents were greatly panicked. For a time, the Local Produce Industry Association chartered British tugboats to go to Gaoqiao, Nantong, and other places to purchase vegetables. Later, although transportation in various places gradually became connected, vegetables and other items were still not allowed to be transported into the urban area, resulting in low vegetable prices outside the barbed wire, allowing them to wither, while the prices in the urban area skyrocketed. Although many people were forced by life to take risks to transport them in, the cost was high, and the selling price would certainly not be low.</p>
<p>Shanghai citizens are now busy with grain, buying firewood, and storing preparations. Food is indeed a big problem, but it is not possible to have only rice without vegetables. Wealthy families have already prepared ham, canned food, etc., and ordinary families have also prepared a little salted yellow croaker. As for vegetables, because they are fresh goods, it is impossible to buy them in large quantities and store them. Although they are getting more expensive every day, housewives are worried about it, but there is nothing they can do.</p>
<h3>Planting the Seeds of Disaster: Eastern and Western Buddha Factions, The Inside Story of Fujian's Armed Clashes, Overseas Chinese Money Fuels the Fire</h3>
<p>[Jinjiang News] Armed clashes, though not unique to southern Fujian, are widely known in that region. On the surface, southern Fujian has a long-standing reputation as a "Zou and Lu by the Sea," a famed land of flourishing culture. Its customs should not be barbaric. Moreover, situated on the coast, it has long enjoyed advanced transportation, and its people often engage in floating commerce, gaining broad experience and knowledge abroad. Logically, armed clashes stemming from barbarity and narrow-mindedness should not occur. Yet, southern Fujian stubbornly maintains armed clashes with centuries of history that have yet to be eliminated.</p>
<p>So, how do armed clashes originate?</p>
<p>Some say that while southern Fujian has long enjoyed external transportation, it remains essentially an agricultural society. In agricultural societies, people regard land as life, and the concept of boundaries is deeply ingrained. Moreover, they live in kinship groups, and the concepts of lineage, clans, and local factions are extremely strong. Armed clashes are a product of the interweaving of these two concepts. While this explanation has its merits, where in China has not been an agricultural society in recent decades? Why are armed clashes particularly rampant in southern Fujian? In reality, two main factors contribute to the armed clashes in southern Fujian: first, the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions, and second, "overseas Chinese money" (remittances from overseas). Here, we will first introduce the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions.</p>
<p>If the armed clashes of southern Fujian could be compiled into a "History of Armed Clashes," then the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions would occupy a crucial position in this history. We certainly do not deny that many armed clashes originate from disputes between clans (surnames), but many armed clashes originate from the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions, and even more armed clashes originate from clan disputes but are amplified by the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions, adding fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>What exactly is "Eastern and Western Buddha" (a term rarely heard by outsiders)?</p>
<p>Let us retell an old folk legend.</p>
<p>During the early Qing Dynasty, Jinjiang had two prominent officials: Jinghai General Marquis Shi Lang and a Hanlin scholar (name unknown). That year, the Hanlin scholar's daughter married General Shi's son. General Shi, relying on his status as a renowned court general, deliberately wore the "Yellow Jacket" specially bestowed by the emperor when the Hanlin scholar visited him. This forced his father-in-law to kneel and pay homage to the emperor upon seeing the "Yellow Jacket." The Hanlin scholar was greatly displeased by this trickery. To return the favor, when General Shi returned the visit, the Hanlin scholar not only hung up the "Iron Nose" (a symbol of imperial authority granted during his brief tenure as "Temporary Ruler"), but also deliberately spread mud throughout the hall, forcing General Shi to kneel and pay homage to the emperor upon seeing the "Iron Nose," and the place where he knelt was filthy mud. Thus, in-laws became enemies. General Shi sought revenge but found it inconvenient to act himself, so he cleverly devised a plan, using small regional concepts and divine power to stir up trouble. The Hanlin scholar countered him using the same method. At that time, General Shi resided in "Fenchi Pu" in the east of the city, while the Hanlin scholar resided in "Fengsheng Pu" in the west of the city. They each actively sought friendly "Pu" (local administrative units), using divine power as a rallying cry. They allied themselves with the heads of friendly "Pu" (deities, disciples, shamans, and thugs), addressing them as brothers. The city's thirty-six "Pu" were divided into two camps, with "Fenchi" and "Fengsheng" as the leaders, known as "Eastern Buddha" and "Western Buddha." This spread from the "Pu" within the city to the villages outside the city, and from Jinjiang to various counties in southern Fujian, with almost no corner untouched. The sole purpose of the "Eastern and Western Buddha" factions was to hate each other and engage in armed clashes. Over two or three hundred years, countless blood was shed, countless lives were lost unjustly, and the animosity only deepened.</p>
<p>Some Ridiculous Examples</p>
<p>When a village with the surname Jia and a village with the surname Yi have a dispute, many other villages with the surnames Jia and Yi eagerly rush to help their respective clans, thus forming an armed clash.</p>
<p>When an "Eastern Buddha" "Pu" and a "Western Buddha" "Pu" have a dispute, many other "Eastern Buddha" and "Western Buddha" "Pu" and villages eagerly rush to help their respective "allies," thus also leading to an armed clash.</p>
<p>When a village with the surname Jia and a village with the surname Yi have a dispute, many other villages with the surnames Jia and Yi, as well as other "Eastern Buddha" or "Western Buddha" factions belonging to the Jia and Yi surnames, come to help their respective clans and allies, thus leading to an even larger armed clash.</p>
<p>This is how armed clashes are formed. However, the so-called "disputes" that trigger armed clashes are sometimes simply ridiculous rather than genuine disputes. The earliest armed clashes may indeed have arisen from fairly serious disputes, but later, the reasons for some armed clashes that we often hear about are less "disputes" and more stubborn stupidity, and are in fact extremely vague traditional concepts.</p>
<p>Here are some ridiculous examples:</p>
<p>A person from village Jia passed through village Yi. Because it was hot, he stopped to rest in the shade of a tree. A child from village Yi swatted a fly on his back. The person, thinking the child was being playful, slapped him lightly. The child cried, so village Yi beat gongs and lined up weapons to resist village Jia. This actually escalated into a large-scale armed clash.</p>
<p>A child from village Jia was grazing cattle. The ignorant cow accidentally stretched its head across the boundary to eat a mouthful of grass from village Yi. Village Yi not only kidnapped the cow or the shepherd, but also initiated negotiations. Coincidentally, village Jia also refused to show weakness, so they actually resorted to armed clashes.</p>
<p>When the "Eastern Buddha" procession was parading their gods, due to the winding alleys, someone accidentally stepped over the boundary line of the neighboring "Western Buddha." The "Western Buddha," who had been watching and monitoring, rushed over, not only beating people but also attempting to destroy the divine palanquin or regalia. After a brawl, a formal armed clash ensued.</p>
<p>Although the names of the places and villages involved in these incidents cannot be recalled due to the passage of time, they certainly occurred. A reporter once spoke with an elementary school student from a village who was enthusiastically talking about the armed clashes between their village and another village. The reporter asked, "Why did you start an armed clash with Village X for no reason? Why are you children so enthusiastic about armed clashes?" The child replied, "Village X is our enemy. Our grandfather said, 'Don't spare anyone from Village X.'"</p>
<p>Who is Fueling the Armed Clashes?</p>
<p>Why can't armed clashes be eliminated?</p>
<p>The answer is: Some people are fueling armed clashes in tangible and intangible ways.</p>
<p>Southern Fujian's progress is too slow. This means that the remaining feudal forces stubbornly persist in southern Fujian society. Despite the relatively widespread and developed culture and education (referring to newspapers and schools) over the past twenty years, the transformative effect of instilling new customs has been small. In today's society, people still talk about clans and local factions everywhere. However, this slow social progress is not the only reason for fueling armed clashes, although it is one of the reasons. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Legal Clarifications</h3>
<p>...Answered by Lawyer Jiang Pingfan...</p>
<p>[Question from Yu Yinlai] I rented a house from someone two years ago for a deposit of one million yuan, with a two-year contract stating that the house would be returned upon expiration and the deposit would be fully refunded, with a signed lease as proof. The contract expired in March of this year, and the person ordered me to move out. I have two questions for clarification.</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) For fixed-term leases of two years or less, the landlord may not request termination of the lease on this basis, even if the term has expired. If the landlord requests to take back the house for personal use, they must provide concrete proof and notify the tenant of the termination of the lease three months in advance. (2) The deposit paid by the tenant at the time of renting the house, if the lease clearly states that it will be fully refunded upon returning the house, should be bound by this special agreement and cannot be claimed based on the price of rice.</p>
<p>[Question from Shen Yuying] My father, Jia, took over a bathhouse in Shanghai in 1932. Later, when the Shanghai War broke out, he locked up the house and fled back to his hometown with his family, without leaving anyone to look after it. Yesterday, I passed by the place and saw that the shop had been taken over and operated by a stranger named Yi. Upon investigation, the property rights of the shop belong solely to my father, and the contract documents from when he took over the shop, as well as all relevant documents regarding water, electricity, and the house, are stored in my possession. I would like to ask: (1) Based on the above situation, since Yi did not obtain Jia's consent or permission and brazenly occupied the shop, has he committed the crime of encroachment? (2) Can Jia legally demand that Yi return the shop and recover the property? (3) If Yi refuses to comply, what procedures can Jia follow? (4) Since my father lives far away in the old capital and is of advanced age and unable to travel, can I, as his child, act as his agent to exercise his rights?</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) If Jia can prove that he had previously obtained the lease rights to the house and the operating rights to the bathhouse, it can be presumed that Yi is unlawfully infringing upon the rights of others. (2) Jia can remove Yi's infringement and demand that he move out. (3) If Yi refuses, the only option is to file a lawsuit to remove the infringement and return the house and shop. (4) Because Jia is elderly, he can entrust his son to negotiate on his behalf.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Wuri Sugar Factory in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>The Wuri Sugar Factory is one of the dozens of sugar factories under the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Its predecessor was the Wuri Sugar Factory of the Japan Sugar Industry Co., Ltd., with a capital of 2.25 million Japanese yen. Its initial name was the Taichung Sugar Co., Ltd. Later, it acquired the Fanshejiao Sugar Company and the Chitang Factory, jointly operated by Temuzhuangzao and Liao Huanwen. Its initial crushing capacity was only 350 tons. In May 1921, it merged with Toyo Sugar Co., Ltd. and planned to build a new-style factory, increasing its crushing capacity to 450 English tons. Later, the areas of Shekou and Dingzai, where the original Chitang Factory was located, were incorporated. In December 1927, it was merged into the Japan Sugar Industry Co., Ltd. After the retrocession, it was operated by the Sugar Corporation, under the jurisdiction of the First Branch. The scale of the Wuri Sugar Factory is quite large. Under the factory director, there is a General Affairs Department, divided into sections for documents, personnel, administration, purchasing, materials, finished products, operations, and medical affairs; an Accounting Department, divided into sections for accounting, costing, and auditing; an Engineering Department, divided into sections for sugar making, machinery, and chemical testing; an Agricultural Department, divided into sections for raw materials, farms, land, and weighing; and a Railway Department, divided into sections for mechanical affairs, track maintenance, and transportation. In addition, there is also an Employee Promotion Association. The employees not only have rich experience and skilled skills but are also quite cooperative and hardworking. Therefore, production is steadily increasing.</p>
<p>In terms of increasing raw material production, the factory had only 300-odd hectares of sugarcane fields in the 1945-1946 period. This was because during the war, the Japanese allowed sugarcane land to be freely abandoned and converted to rice cultivation to supply military grain. After the takeover, the factory encouraged farmers to plant sugarcane seedlings. However, many farmers remained hesitant and waited to see. Later, the factory repeatedly sent personnel to various townships to promote and persuade them, and also conducted surveys of planting areas. At the same time, the sugar sharing method was implemented. Later, the ratio was increased from 52 to 48 to a 50-50 split. As a result, the benefits for farmers increased, which was incomparable to the exploitation by the Japanese in the past. Farmers flocked to grow sugarcane, and the area of sugarcane fields gradually expanded. In the 1947-1948 period, it had increased to more than 1,071.46 hectares. It is estimated that the planting area in the 1948-1949 period will reach 1,660.81 hectares.</p>
<p>The factory spares no effort to improve agricultural facilities, such as water conservancy development, variety selection, and pest and disease control. As for land, the situation is particularly complex due to different policies during the Japanese era. After years of active consolidation, it has gradually become organized and is handling the leasing of public land in accordance with provincial orders. Furthermore, on July 1, 1948, the Beitunghu Sugarcane Specialized Cooperative Farm was established, which can increase raw material production and help unemployed farmers, greatly benefiting the rural economy. Currently, the factory has a total of nine raw material zones and three self-operated farms.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the factory's crushing capacity and sugar production. The factory suffered little damage during the war. Although it was bombed twice, neither bomb detonated. However, due to years of disrepair, various equipment needed to be overhauled. After the takeover, the factory actively started restoration work. After more than a year of effort, equipment such as cane unloaders, cane conveyors, shredders, crushers, cylinders, boilers, heating tanks, evaporation tanks, crystallizers, and centrifuges have been repaired and completed. During the 1945-1946 sugar production period, the raw material was insufficient, and the factory had not yet been fully repaired, so all the harvested raw material was transported to the Taichung Sugar Factory for crushing. In the 1947-1948 period, due to the abundance of raw materials and the gradual completion of various machines, all employees were excited. The factory buildings, machine parts, and air pipes were all painted, giving them a brand-new look. Crushing began in January 1948 and lasted only two months. Second-grade white granulated sugar was produced using the lime method, with a crushing capacity of 800 tons and power generation of 176 kW.</p>
<p>The factory originally operated its own railway, including the Shuikutou, Shekou, and Dingdai lines, with a total length of 53 kilometers. It had five locomotives, 260 sugarcane cars, and 280 platform cars. The lines were distributed in various raw material areas to transport raw materials and supplies. However, during the takeover period, none of the lines were complete. The sleepers were corroded, or the bridges were damaged. Later, in accordance with the railway development plan, restoration was carried out on a scheduled basis. Currently, the Shuikutou, Shekou lines, and the Lincuo transportation line have all been completed. The repair of locomotives, the renovation of sugarcane cars, the refurbishment of road signs, and the painting of vehicles are also being actively carried out. However, the factory's railway lines mostly run through the Wuxi and Maoluo Rivers in central Taiwan, so many bridges must be built. During the rainy season, they are often washed away. Therefore, they are only built before the sugar production period and dismantled after the sugar production period, resulting in the factory having these temporary projects every year. Furthermore, the Typhoon Gloria in June last year damaged the main bridge of the Feizi River, which was repaired by contractors. This project was completed and opened to traffic at the end of December last year, preventing the transportation operations of this period from being affected and enabling production to be increased as scheduled.</p>
<p>In order to encourage employees' work enthusiasm and help them stabilize their lives, the factory attaches great importance to employee welfare facilities, such as the payment of education subsidies for children and living subsidies, and the establishment of consumer cooperatives. Other facilities such as medical rooms, libraries, barber shops, bathhouses, and sports fields are also well-equipped. In addition, a welfare farm is established near the factory site to sow rice and open vegetable gardens.</p>
<p>Since April 1, 1947, an Employee Promotion Association has been established. After the management of all employee welfare undertakings of the factory was transferred to the association, the results have been even more remarkable, such as organizing tour groups to visit scenic spots in batches, organizing the first sports meeting, and holding infant health competitions. In order to promote the mental and physical development of employees and to harmonize relationships and eliminate barriers, two Mandarin Chinese training classes were also held, and a Mandarin Chinese speech competition was also held, with outstanding results.</p>
<p>After the retrocession, the Wuri Sugar Factory spent a lot of time reorganizing equipment and repairing equipment. Crushing only started in January last year, but the results were no less than those of other sugar factories. Currently, the factory is working hard to promote its original goals, with particular emphasis on agricultural reform, increased raw material production, reduced costs, improved technology, improved quality, and the utilization of by-products, in order to actively increase production.</p>

<h3>Silver Bulls Disappear</h3>
<p>Nickel Coin and Silver Dime Trading Becomes Lively</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the authorities executed six silver bulls a few days ago, the silver bulls in various places disappeared yesterday. The clanging of silver dollars can no longer be heard near the small vegetable markets in various places. On the other hand, the trading of nickel coins and silver dimes has become lively. Even the copper coins that have been absent for a long time have become the object of trade for various vendors.</p>
<h3>Prices of Meat and Vegetarian Dishes Become Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday was a regular Sunday holiday. After the disappearance of silver dollar trading on the streets, the prices of meat and vegetarian dishes in the vegetable markets also became stable. For example, pork leg meat was still 30 million yuan per catty, and ribs were still 28 million yuan. Old tofu was 3 million yuan per square. Vegetables such as bok choy, small tang vegetables, cabbage, and beans ranged from 1 million yuan to 1.5 million yuan per catty, depending on the quality.

<h3>Quiet at Longhua Airport; China National Aviation Corporation Flies Out Three Planes; Central Air Transport Corporation Expected to Resume Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The disturbance at Longhua Airport the day before yesterday caused a sudden suspension of passenger transport.

<h3>Weekend Scare: Cannons Boom Amid Movie Sounds; Residents Startled, Shops Close Doors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the Nationalist artillery unleashed its power, heavily bombarding enemy positions. The loud booming continued for several hours. It coincided with a heavy downpour and thunder and lightning, awakening many residents from their sleep. In the morning, shops along Nanjing Road and Central Lin Sen Road kept their iron gates half-closed, but business continued as usual. Large signs saying "Business as Usual" were posted outside the gates. By the afternoon, citizens saw police patrolling the streets, and public order was very good. Most stores immediately opened their doors and returned to their normal state. Yesterday was overcast and rainy all day. Residents in the Nanshi area continued to move to the city center with their suitcases and trunks. Most citizens spent their Sunday holiday in parks or movie theaters with very happy hearts. Due to temporary ticket price adjustments, business at the movie theaters was slightly worse than last Sunday, but the streets were still crowded with pedestrians.</p>
<h3>Authorities Investigate Banks and Firms Regarding Silver Dollar Payouts</h3>
<p>Severe Punishment for Secretly Obtaining</p>
<p>[East China News Agency] National banks have resumed issuing silver dollars to commercial banks and firms. All industries can withdraw silver dollars daily at posted rates through commercial banks and firms. In order to prevent some banks and firms from using excuses to avoid payouts, the authorities require each bank and firm to submit a list of their total deposit amount and their silver coin inventory to the national bank for record-keeping at the end of each business day. The proportion of silver dollars to be paid out to customers the next day will be based on the ratio of the previous day's silver dollar inventory, plus the number of silver dollars that can be obtained from the national bank that day, to the total deposit amount. This must be publicly displayed in the bank for everyone to know. Starting today, relevant authorities will conduct strict investigations. Any illegal banks or firms secretly obtaining silver dollars without providing them to customers will be severely punished by the Garrison Headquarters in accordance with martial law.</p>

<h3>Brief Sunny Breaks During Minor Fullness; Sunshine Expected Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's weather in the city was the worst seen this month. Heavy clouds and low pressure were only about 1,000 feet above ground. Thunder, lightning, and showers at around 5:00 AM disturbed people's sleep. Afterwards, there was drizzling rain, sometimes stopping and sometimes falling. Although the rain stopped and the clouds cleared briefly at noon, with sunshine, it was very short-lived, and the sky quickly became overcast again. The walls and floors indoors were also unusually damp. According to the Meteorological Observatory, since the beginning of this month, Pacific air currents and mainland air currents have been meeting in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, creating a low-pressure phenomenon with intermittent sunshine and rain. This is the "Minor Fullness" climate before the "Winter Solstice." Since yesterday, the wind direction has changed to a moderate northerly to northeasterly wind, possibly due to a high-pressure system appearing over the Sea of Japan. The weather today will still be overcast, but the cloud cover is expected to rise to 3,000 to 6,000 feet, which should help our brave air force. Sunshine may be seen tomorrow, depending on whether there is a change in wind direction. However, it will take some time for long-term sunny weather to arrive.</p>
<h3>Suburban District Offices Move to Downtown Areas</h3>
<p>[Public News Agency] Due to the impact of the war, the various district offices in the suburbs of the city are unable to operate in their original jurisdictions, so they have all moved to the downtown area.

<h3>Major Fire in Nanshi Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[East China News Agency] At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, a major fire suddenly broke out on the edge of the Penglai District in Nanshi. Zhou Zhaoxiang, Director of the Municipal Police Department's Fire Department, and Ye Binyong, Chief of the Fire Brigade, personally went to direct the rescue. Fire engines from the Central District Fire Brigade and the Hubei South District Volunteer Fire Brigade were dispatched to assist in the rescue. The fire was extinguished around 2:00 PM, and the extent of the damage is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Many Marriages in Chaotic Times; Residents Busy Moving</h3>
<p>[Public News Agency] Due to the intensifying war, most citizens feel that family reunions are uncertain, so if sons and daughters have not yet married, they rush to get married. However, because of these extraordinary times, everything is simplified. Most weddings are done without ceremonies, with only the parents of both sides stamping their seals on the marriage certificate. Also, yesterday, residents in the Gaochang Temple area of Nanshi, feeling the loud cannon fire, moved to the city center, causing moving tricycles to be constantly seen on the streets and alleys all day.</p>
<h3>Campaign to Comfort the Troops: Citizens Enthusiastically Donate; Excellent Broadcast Programs Continue Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Since the Shanghai Comfort Association launched its campaign to comfort the troops, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 AM, the Shanghai Radio Station's telephone lines have been constantly busy with citizens responding by pledging to donate silver dollars, U.S. dollars, gold yuan certificates, food, towels, rubber shoes, shirts, etc. Some have even donated white rice, expensive wines, and cigarettes, in considerable quantities. This shows the citizens' enthusiasm for comforting the brave soldiers on the front lines. The statistics are now being compiled, and members of the Postal Association have been dispatched to collect the donations separately. Today is the second day of the association's fundraising broadcast, with programs including Shanghai ballad singing, Yangzhou opera, Huai opera, and Yue opera, with all the famous Shanghai actors participating.</p>
<h3>Chairman Fang's Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] During yesterday's fundraising broadcast to comfort the troops, Mayor Chen, Commander Chen, and the association's Chairman Fang Zhi all gave speeches. Excerpts from Chairman Fang's speech, "The Communists are Digging Their Own Graves in Shanghai," are as follows:</p>
<p>Unleashing True Power</p>
<p>Judging from the Nationalist army's war results in Wusong and Pudong, the Communists are really nothing special. Haven't we all heard? The Communists previously announced on the radio that they would attack Shanghai on the 15th and occupy Shanghai on the 17th, but today's Shanghai is still safe and sound. This proves that the Communist propaganda is completely deceptive. As long as all the elders and folks in our city unite and do not panic or be afraid, the defense of Shanghai will surely win the final victory. We must know that defending Shanghai is defending China. If we cannot eliminate the Communists in Shanghai, there is nowhere else to eliminate them. In the past, the Nationalist army withdrew entirely for strategic reasons, but now it has reached the point where the Nationalist army can no longer tolerate it and is truly unleashing its power, which is also the beginning of eliminating the main Communist forces.</p>
<p>The Nationalist army is fighting in Shanghai not only to fight for the independence of the nation, but also to protect the lives and property of our city's six million citizens. Therefore, we, the people, must work together with one heart and one mind, and mobilize all financial and material resources to support the front lines. Under the premise that everything is for the front lines, everything is for the soldiers, and everything is for suppressing the Communists, we hope that our compatriots will recognize the importance of the defense war and respond with the greatest enthusiasm. For the campaign to comfort the troops launched by the Comfort Association today, we certainly do not need everyone to go to the front lines to fight, but donating money and goods to comfort the troops is encouraging the soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>Enthusiastically Comfort the Soldiers</p>
<p>Regarding donations of comfort items from all sectors, they can be sent to the Social Bureau's Comfort Association, and funds can be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Bank and its branches. After collecting these funds and materials, the Comfort Association will immediately distribute them to the soldiers at the front, in accordance with the hopes of all compatriots.</p>
<p>Compatriots, in addition to enthusiastically comforting the soldiers at the front, to fulfill each person's contribution and conscience to the country, at the same time, we should also fulfill our responsibility as citizens to stabilize the local area, because there are still a few conspirators within the city who are trying to take advantage of the situation to sabotage, disrupt, and harass. We must mercilessly strike at these traitors and Communist spies and thoroughly eliminate them in order to ensure safety. Now the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has established a method to reward people for reporting Communist spies, and we hope that everyone will pay attention and work together. I would like to appeal with the greatest sincerity to all compatriots who share life and death and share weal and woe: we must save the country and save ourselves, we must do everything for the front lines, everything for the soldiers, do our best to donate, and closely report and eliminate Communist spies.</p>
<p>In addition, recently, refugees in the suburbs have been displaced and suffered greatly due to the war. Commander Tang is extremely concerned about this situation and is actively urging the authorities to step up efforts to provide relief so that the refugees can have food and shelter without worry. However, during this tense time of war, we can only grit our teeth and endure all hardships in order to strive for the protection of freedom and democracy and the victory of the defense war. As long as our city's six million citizens unite and mobilize, we will be able to suppress the Communists and make Shanghai a place where the Communists dig their own graves.</p>
<h3>Seven Rice Stores in Longhua District Reported for Embezzling Rationed Rice; Bought Ration Coupons from Residents at Low Prices; Tao Guanjin and Zhang Xiuyu Detained</h3>
<p>Seven designated rice stores in Caoxing Town, Longhua District, colluded with personnel handling the distribution of registered rice households in the district, purchased ration coupons, altered and signed coupons, and embezzled for profit, which was discovered by citizens who reported it to Mayor Chen. The city government has sent personnel to verify the facts and has detained the relevant criminals, Tao Guanjin and Zhang Xiuyu, and is continuing to pursue other accomplices. It is reported that according to regulations, the third installment of household rationed rice for April in Longhua District should have been completed by May 10. Because Qibao, Meilong, and Xinzhuang in the district were close to the front lines, the rationed rice could not be transported. The price of rice in the city gradually increased, and the difference in ration prices became larger. The seven designated rice stores in Caoxing Town – Gongxing, Luohesheng, Binda, Wantai, Gongda, Qinji, and Zhanglongshun – purchased ration coupons at low prices to offset their accounts with the Civil Food Allocation Office, claiming to the public that the rationed rice had been sold out, causing most residents near Caoxing Town to be unable to purchase it. Later, Zhou Qiusheng, the owner of Qiu Ji Rice Store on Guanshengyuan Road in Longhua District, stepped forward out of righteous indignation to publicly report the crime. It is reported that Wang, a committee member of the Sixth Supervisory District of the Civil Food Allocation Office, verbally notified Tao Guanjin, an employee of Gongxing Rice Store acting as an agent for rice merchant Wang Yinsong in Longhua District on the morning of May 11 at the Longhua District Office, instructing him to immediately notify the designated rice stores to collect ration coupons first, and submit them to the bank along with the rice money on the 11th, and then reissue them after the rationed rice arrived that afternoon to appease public anger. In addition to carrying out Wang's instructions, Tao Guanjin purchased 45 ration coupons from residents such as Zhang Jinfu and purchased 225 catties of rice from Zhanglongshun and other seven rice stores at an average price of 100,000 yuan per coupon. He also received instructions from Li Youlun, an employee of the Civil Food Allocation Office, stating that the quantity of ordinary rationed rice did not match the quantity of key rationed rice for teachers and civil servants, and instructed the rice stores to alter and sign the coupons. Zhang Xiuyu, the owner of Zhanglongshun Rice Store in the district, received the third installment of household rice for April on May 8 and then purchased 20 ration coupons with 50 catties of rice from A Mao, a servant of Xiang Ruichang, a resident of the district. He also purchased ration coupons for another 150 catties of rice from others and refused to distribute it, claiming that the rice was sold out, so he illegally purchased 307 catties of household rice privately, which has been seized by the Longhua District Police Bureau. In addition, Yang Jigen and Xue Yuchun, the directors of Wantai and Luohesheng rice stores in the district, illegally purchased ration coupons.</p>
<p>To Seek Huge Profits</p>
<p>It is heard that Tao Guanjin and Zhang Xiuyu have been detained by the Municipal Police Bureau and have admitted to the embezzlement. In order to rectify discipline and severely punish corruption, Mayor Chen decided to thoroughly investigate the personnel involved in the embezzlement case, deal with them severely according to the law, and investigate whether similar incidents have occurred in the district's past rice distribution to ensure that rice distribution truly benefits the residents. Zhou Qiusheng, the owner of Qiu Ji Rice Store who came forward to report the crime, is commendable for his courage, and the authorities will give him a special reward.</p>
<h3>Eight Parishes in Xujiahui Shelter Refugees: Over 3,000 People; Over 500 Already Housed; Lack of Fuel Makes Cooking Difficult</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to the Catholic Education Advancement Association, in the past two weeks, the eight central areas of the Catholic Church in Xujiahui, including the Tushanwan Male Orphanage, the Sacred Heart Female Orphanage, the Shanghai Diocesan Seminary, and the Xujiahui Observatory, have sheltered 3,200 refugees who have fled to Shanghai from rural areas within a range of 10 to 20 miles southwest of Shanghai. Xu Zonghai, the priest of St. Ignatius Cathedral, has also allocated his school buildings and priests' residences entirely to them, so the housing problem for more than 500 of these refugees has been solved. Most of these refugees brought one or two bags of rice with them when they came to Shanghai, but they are struggling to cook because of the lack of fuel.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Transportation and Public Utilities Ordered to Charge in Gold Yuan Certificates</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Various public and private industries here have been pricing in silver dollars one after another, while the government's payments are in Gold Yuan Certificates, leading to repeated disputes. The Governor's Office has now specially stipulated two measures: (1) Various transportation and public utility agencies can use the silver dollar price as a reference for calculating their costs in order to maintain their normal operations. (2) Various transportation and public utility agencies shall uniformly charge in Gold Yuan Certificates from now on. If there is forced collection of silver dollars, people are allowed to report it, and they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Cholera, Typhoid Fever, and Dysentery are the Most Common Infectious Diseases in the City; Summer is Coming, and Epidemic Prevention Work is Urgently Needed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The flames of war are burning in the suburbs of Shanghai, a large number of refugees are pouring into the city, the population is soaring, and everyone is listening to the sound of cannons in a small world, living together, and it is difficult to take care of environmental hygiene. As summer approaches, epidemic prevention will be one of the most urgent tasks.</p>
<p>The main infectious diseases that have been prevalent in Shanghai over the years include smallpox, cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery, and meningitis. Among them, cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery are the most common in summer. The reason for this is mostly due to foodborne infections. In addition, humidity and mosquitoes are also closely related to the spread of diseases. Regarding humidity, according to research, the prevalence of cholera is related to the absolute humidity in the area. As far as Shanghai is concerned, cholera will not prevail when the humidity reaches below 10 hectopascals of mercury. At present, it is not possible to artificially change the temperature, but if we can pay attention to environmental hygiene and personal health, the impact of temperature on the body's resistance can also be reduced to a very low limit. For example, getting more rest, and having a regular diet and sleep, can all strengthen the body's resistance to diseases.</p>
<p>Drinking Water from Dug Wells Should Be Disinfected</p>
<p>In terms of prevention, in addition to receiving vaccinations, the cleanliness of drinking water should be paid the most attention. According to a survey of cholera cases in Shanghai in 1946 and 1947, the results found that many cases were caused by drinking water from earthen wells. At present, many neighborhoods have dug earthen wells, and special attention should be paid to disinfection when using them. In addition, attention should also be paid to the treatment of feces and sewage. The general public should be vigilant together, not drinking raw water, and not eating melon, fruit, and food sprinkled with raw water, so that germs cannot be transmitted.</p>
<p>Unclean Melons and Fruits are Disease Vectors</p>
<p>Unclean melons, fruits, beverages, and popsicles on the market in summer are vectors of disease. Last year, the Health Bureau tested popsicles sold on the street, and the results showed that 99% were unqualified, and only one or two were qualified. The situation is the same for those "frozen sodas" made by vendors themselves. Although the authorities have stepped up crackdowns on these unclean drinks, drinkers drink them, and when they get sick, they have already suffered deeply. Therefore, citizens should be vigilant and not buy and eat them casually. In addition, the work of eliminating flies and mosquitoes should also be promoted. DDT is a very effective agent invented in recent years, and citizens can generally spray and disinfect their residences to the extent that they can afford it.</p>
<p>Inability to Obtain Nutrition Greatly Reduces Resistance</p>
<p>The Chinese old saying goes, after a great war, there will be an epidemic. However, due to the pressure of life, the general middle and lower class citizens have no energy to pay attention to nutrition, and their body resistance is greatly reduced, and diseases can easily enter. Furthermore, due to financial difficulties, they also feel powerless to use medicine. Therefore, if an infectious disease occurs, it will spread like wildfire and be difficult to extinguish. Therefore, if an epidemic occurs in Shanghai this summer, the situation will be quite terrible. Epidemic prevention is already a matter of urgent importance.</p>
<p>Epidemic Prevention is Like Fire Prevention; It Should Be a Joint Effort</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Authority should be responsible for leading the way to the extent possible, but epidemic prevention is not something that the authorities or citizens alone can do well. There must be the planned guidance and economic strength of the health authorities, plus the cooperation of all the citizens of the city, in order to succeed. Epidemic prevention is like fire prevention; it is useless to only take care of yourself. If an epidemic prevails, the personal safety will also be at stake, so epidemic prevention must be planned, organized, and targeted. Doing it together within the scope of our ability, although it cannot be said that it can absolutely prevent the occurrence of epidemics, at least it can alleviate much.</p>

Today, facing Qingbai, the outcome is related to the championship, and they will definitely fight with all their strength.</p>
<p>Qingbai and the Railway team first met last Tuesday, and the match ended in a 3-3 draw. If they can defeat Donghua today, they can win the championship, otherwise, they will hand it over to Donghua. The team has many young and strong newcomers with enough energy. This time, they have the World Games representative Yan Shixin sitting in the back, and Fei Chunhua has returned to help, adding icing to the cake and strengthening their strength. The battle between the two heroes for the championship is worth looking forward to.</p>
