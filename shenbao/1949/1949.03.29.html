<h3>和談程序尚待商定　雙方代表將先開預備會　政府要求暫停軍事行動</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕政府和談代表張治中，廿八日下午五時答覆記者對和談前途看法之詢問，表示樂觀，渠之語氣爲：「我向來是樂觀的」，但渠拒絕說明樂觀之因素。對即將在平展開之和談程序與政府對中共八項條件之處置辦法，亦均不予透露。張氏稱：「余不能就此有所說明，因恐影響和談之進行，惟代表團抵平後，必首先舉行預備會議一次，故其程序目前勢難預測」。張氏笑容滿面，談話時甚少憂戚之色。記者詢以此行期限多少，張氏亦未預擬。對將來是否必須於平·京間來往請示，則稱：須視事實而定，對戰犯問題之討論及是否首先討論停戰問題，以及憲法法統等等，張氏顯出頗難解釋之態。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕國共和談開始前，在平代表李代總統負責與中共聯繫之黄啓漢氏，經常與總統府通消息，聞在黄氏之連絡溝通之下，若干問題頗能獲得順利之進展，約於兩日前，南京方面曾由此橋樑向中共提出於和談進行期中暫行停止軍事行動之要求，此項要求並未獲得直接答覆，但負責人士認爲，京畿附近安慶之戰事，廿八日顯已有事實上之表現，亦即安慶共軍已有自動後撤之行動，此點足以說明中共對和談之誠意，如此則即將展開之和談頗可有樂觀之象徵。又將來和談代表在平之接觸，每日均將與南京通電信，獲有任何結果，亦將提交南京方面研究討論，再與北平連絡。廿八日晚某權威人士稱：目前國民黨內部正在力求團結及統一意志之中，務使和談代表在平之商談能順利進行，此種團結與統一，某權威人士認爲已極有把握。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕和談代表黃紹竑昨晚五時自港飛抵滬，當夜搭車晋京。黄氏對和談之展望拒作任何推測。論及和談中之難題，氏謂：個人之看法，戰犯是難題，整軍問題尤其機微困難，但關鍵還在雙方之誠意，有誠意，則大事可以化小，無誠意，則小事可以化大。詢以將來和談之結果是否將經國民黨內最高決策機關通過，答謂：過去慣例是如此。又詢以廣州方面對和談之看法，黄氏表示不知，但謂：一事之取決，當依多數爲準，與地點無關。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕章土釗昨晨返滬，料理私事，定今夜再度晋京，侯命飛平。據談：和平代表飛平日期，非本月三十一日，卽爲四月一日，一切視氣候而定。前兩日，和談代表與政府當局曾有不拘形式之會商，非如外傳之參與軍事會議，報載徐永昌·顧祝同出席會議一點，尤與事實不符。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿八日電〕政府已正式通知中共，和平代表團將於三十一日飛平。共方指定六國飯店爲代表團寓所，並巳布置北平·南京間之無綫電通訊。聞代表團於四月一日和談開始時將請共方宣布無條件停戰。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕政府領袖廿八日仍忙於集會，據悉：和談準備在事實上業已完成，李代總統，行政院長何應欽及和談代表現正排定與立委·監委以及國民黨中政會委員及中執委等開會的程序表，俾徵詢渠等意見，而獲致政府內部立塲的統一。</p>
<h3>總統府昨有會議　政立監三院長和談代表均出席　府論聯及和談等問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕政府在籌備與中共進行和談之中，李代總統於廿八日晚八時在總統府召集行政，立法，監察三院院長及部份立委以及和談代表舉行談話會，就和談有關各項問題提出討論，並將前此政府十人委會擬就之和平綱領再度提出，逐項研討，由出席者廣泛發表意見，以爲和談代表赴平時之參考。此項會議直至深夜十二時始畢，會後並相約絕對不得向外透露。記者曾訪于院長右任及邵力子，詢以會談內容，兩氏僅吿以係討論有關立·監·行政三院之連緊簡題，和談問題亦洽及，但內容決不容透露。按本日出席談話會者有何應欽·于右任·童冠賢。劉健華·邱昌渭·彭昭賢·王啓江。范予遂·甘家馨·程思遠·尹述賢。黄宇人·陳克文等。</p>
<h3>權威人士論和談　時間至多一個月</h3>
<p>難題仍須向京請示</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據權威人士稱：此次在平舉行之國共和談，時間至多延長至一個月左右，各代表並無全權，遇有難題時，須隨時向南京請示。代表團飛平之前，並無赴溪口訪蔣之擬議。政府代表此行並未携有方案，十人委員會所計劃之方案，事實上早吿流產，故在技術上，代表對協議之各點，僅向南京方面負責，國民黨內其他方面之意見，將如何予以統一，則爲政府之事，與和談代表無關。邵力子對和談之悲觀態度，即由此而起，蓋深恐京方之和平見解未必能爲黨內其他方面所接受也。至於外界深懼中共堅持八點，致和談不歡而散一節，有關人士認爲，不必過於悲觀，因「中共之行情亦早晚不同」。中共爲最講求現實之政黨，政策隨時依環境而修正，決不走不通之路。自接管平津後，已發現困難電重，故可能熊度較兩月前已有變更。惟値得憂慮者，中共有幾位軍事領袖，力主乘此千載一時之良機，消減國軍之剩餘實力，以免和談曠日持久，而予國軍以復蘇之機會。政府方面，雖主和最力者，亦常念「能戰然後能和」之格言，故和談前途如何，須開談後方能分曉。至於最近共軍在江北之軍事行動，則在上海和平代表團赴平之際，中國領袖已表示：卽使和談重開，亦不能約束其在大江以北之軍事行動，但相信在和談期內，渡江之攻勢不致發動</p>
<h3>友好包團張治中　探詢對和談消息</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕張治中廿八日下午四時在介壽堂舉行茶會，招待友好，到約百餘人，張氏爲當前和談聲中之紅人，賓客一再包圍，探聽對和談之消息，且有若干並未接到請柬而至者，一時談笑風生，配以張氏之詼諧情調，至爲和諧。</p>
<h3>范予農等將建議　和談進立院休會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕立委范予遂等多人，廿八日正在發動一項建議，要求立院在和談期間休會。據范氏稱：立院休會將有利於和談的進行，因院會中不謹塡之言論，可能影響和談進展。</p>
<h3>立院內政會審查　簡化省級機構案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電」立法院內政委會廿八日晨九時開會，審查孟雲橋等所提「簡化省級行政機構」案，羅貢華主席，內部參事王廷　列席，報吿省政府組織狀况後退席，各委員開始審查，原則同意，惟對提案第二項」省境淪陷共區，其省政府之業務無多，尤應竭力緊縮，以减輕國庫之負担，民·財·敎·建四廳及會計處不必分設，僅准其暫設秘書廳一廳，分科掌理各項事務，其他機構「律裁併」認爲應函請政院注意，並推鄭震宇提下次院會報吿。</p>
<h3>敎部政次一席　擬請章益出任</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕敎部政務次長一席，據聞關係方面擬請現任復旦大學校長章益出任。</p>
<h3>于右任打消辭意　監院年會定今下午閉幕</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕監察院長于右任函全體監委請辭院長後，經全體監委多次懇切挽留，並以同進退請求打銷辭意，結果于氏爲體念時艱，免因其辭職而造成監院之不安起見，已於廿八日打銷辭意，並親往主持監院大會，午並與副院長劉哲在國際聯歡社宴請全體監委，各監委以于氏巳打銷辭意，紛往敬酒，賓主至爲歡洽，迄下午二時宴會始散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕監院本年度年會定廿九日下午三時閉幕，院長于右任將親致閉幕詞，其內容，于氏廿八日已吿負責起草之某秘書，主要在說明監院對促進和平及革新政治之願望，至於所調法統問題，應取決於人民之意見。此外，並將魷其辭職之動機與打銷辭意之經過有所說明。監院年會閉幕後，各監委即將離京，分返各地，監院秘書處已與航空公司洽妥包專機三架，送各監委至台。穗·渝三地。</p>
<h3>革命先烈紀念　中樞舉行春祭</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕三月廿九日爲革命先烈紀念日，中樞定是日上午十時在靈谷寺舉行春祭陣亡將士典禮，由李代總統主祭，中樞在京文武官員陪祭。</p>
<h3>發布和談新聞　將採公報方式　記者可否隨赴北平尚待研究</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕張治中廿八日接見記者時，記者羣請求張氏允予隨行赴平，採訪和談消息，張氏答以在赴平時必與中共研究，如可能當歡迎諸君去，惟此項新聞之發布，必將採取公報方式，統一發表。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕某高級官方人士稱：政府正考慮向中共建議，允許中外記者赴平，專門採訪及發布和談消息，並不受限制及檢查，以免中共壟斷和談消息。</p>
<h3>中共青年聯盟　強烈攻擊美國</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕中共廿八日「在和平或戰爭」方面與蘇聯站在一面，並在要求和平聲中，對美國加以新攻擊，共黨北平之廣播稱，蘇聯爲唯一之和平國家，此問對二次大戰後第二次以政治方法結束中國內戰之企圖，將是否成功一點，尙無明顯之樂觀跡象。在北平廣播中共黨，靑年聯盟强烈攻擊美國，並保證在另一大戰中與蘇聯並肩作戰，算爲其對定於四月在巴黎舉行之世界和平大會的致敬。靑年聯盟稱，聯盟要指出，「美帝國主義爲招致戰爭之主犯」。聯盟宣稱：和平方法，乃「加強蘇聯領導之民主陳綫，以更大決心向美帝國主義為首　國際反動集團作戰。中國人民　青年，在過去三十年中，與蘇聯人民及青年已成立最密切最堅強之革命友誼，不管在承平時期抑或戰時，我們將與蘇聯及所有民主國家站在同一陳綫」。</p>
<h3>大法官考委缺額人選　監察院已予同意　因無女性曾起激烈爭辯</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕李代總統提名咨請監院同意之大法官及考試委員缺額人選，廿八日上午監院舉行大會審查，下午舉行大會行使同意權，投票結果，均得出席委員過半數之同意票，獲得監院之同意。陳劍翛之被提任爲考試委員，爲各委員所抨擊反對，險被取消，陳得同意票僅五十六票，較怯定之過半數同意票僅多出三票，幸獲同意，是項結果，即由監院以書面咨達代總統，俾正式提出任命。茲誌李代總統提名並獲監院同意之大怯官及老試委員名單如下：</p>
<p>大法官八人夏勤·翁敬棠·葉在均·李浩培·梅汝璈·向哲濬·魏大同·蘇希洵。</p>
<p>考試委員九人柳詒徵，張其昀·高一涵·陳劍翛·艾偉·鄧鴻藩·馬師儒·水梓·張儐生。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕監院廿八日大會，對大怯官及考委缺額人選行使同意權時，女監委爲大法官名單中原已商定提出之錢劍秋（女）未被列入，致全部名單中無一女性，深表不滿。上下午中崔震華·馮雲仙·來英等均先後起立發言，力爭大法官中應有一女性，應將錢劍秋加入咨文中，同時行使同意權。男監委以此與法不合，表示反對，曾引起繳烈爭辯，延至下午五時，始進行投票，女監委於投票前，曾多方疏通，請將李代總統提名之八名大法官中不同意一人，俾可以再補提錢劍秋，惟開票結果，八名大法官竟均獲同意，女監委之努力復歸失敗，散會前遂均氣憤憤離席。據某女監委吿記者：「昨天郭德潔還吿訴我們，說大法官名單中有錢劍秋的，不知道怎的今天一看咨文錢却被取消了，我們女的總是容易被欺負的，但我們還要奮鬥下去，只要有女的存在，我們女的魷要力爭女權到底。」</p>

<h3>闡述對大西洋公約感想　朱家驊發表談話　謂為爭取和平積極有效的行動</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕朱家驊　氏，頃發表書面談話，闡述其對於大西洋公約之感想稱：今日世界和平遍遭嚴重的威脅，人類的安全與自由，已爲恐懼所籠罩，實因過去大家忽視侵略因素的危險，一任其滋長蔓延，甚至於助長的結果，以致第二次大戰付出如此慘重犧牲的代價，僅得到一種不完全的休戰狀態；更因大家於慘痛大戰之餘，醉心於樂觀的幻想與迂遠的議論，因循觀望，對於防止戰禍復萌，及保障和平方法，不即採取積極行動，遂使聯合國威信日墮，末由發揮其正義的力量。近四年來，大家於痛定思痛之餘，漸有明確的認識，且因潛在的與外來的侵略因素，桴鼓互應，使各國都爲腹心之息所困擾，益感危險性之空前嚴重，我國創痛尤深，自更能深切體察。聯合國迭因否決權之濫用，無法防止侵略行爲，大西洋公約開宗明義，即强調保衛民主原則及自由制度的決心，並協定集體防禦與維護和平的切實辦怯，誠爲爭取和平積極而有效的行動，亦可說是人類對當前危機的覺醒，故最近復有太平洋公約與東亞聯盟的發動，認識既日深刻而普遍，侵略因素必可消減，人類再度浩刦，亦當能解除。環顧國際形勢，益爲開朗，對我們爭取眞正和平的努力，日見有利，我們更當鼓舞勇氣，力求改革，一致向前邁進，自有光明的前途。</p>

<h3>青年之路—自由中國</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>—青年節為公祭戴季陶先生而作—</p>
<p>戴季陶先生獻身革命，文章報國，名垂不朽，抗戰期間，恒以勝利後中國之和平統一為慮。上月十二日，戴先生逝世於廣州東園，當必以不及親見戰後有一獨立自由和平統一之新中國為憾事。</p>
<p>今天為黃花崗先烈成仁紀念，亦卽為我國的青年節，京滬兩地同志友好，因為戴先生平生最愛護青年，故同時特於今天公祭這一位青年導師。</p>
<p>筆者獻身報業，尙在青年時期，自問於本黨報業先進中，平生文字道義之交，情誼在師友之間者，葉楚傖陳布雷兩先生而外，當以戴先生為最親密。勝利以還，楚傖先生先以勞瘁謝世，去冬布雷先生積憂長眠，今又弔吾戴先生，誠不自知其涕泗之何從。回憶民國十年左右，筆者追隨布雷先生於役商報，望平街頭，每當午夜，戴先生轍相顧存，抵掌傾談，上下議論以為快，甚且宵深不去，直到筆者工作完畢，始相偕步往「四時春」點飢，繼續暢談，習為常事。由今思之，直同隔世！今值青年節日，勉抑悲懷，綴為數語，以敬告吾親愛的青年同胞，不能為戴先生在天之靈所默許否？</p>
<p>戴先生在民國十六年冬，曾將他任中山大學校長時對同學們講演的筆紀整理後，編成小冊，題名「青年之路」，前後十餘萬言，說明他當時對於國事黨事的觀察體騐。（此書現在中國文化服務社有印售）。這本書與同時戴先生的另一著作「國民革命與中國國民黨」，都銷行得很廣，為一般青年所傳誦。今天筆者所以要無論誰「青年之路」者，還是想引伸戴先生的遺著，針對目前的大局，向青年朋友貢獻幾名肺腑之言。</p>
<p>戴先生在「青年之路」自序裏說：「革命是求生，不是求死，是做真實的工作，不是兒戲。兒戲革命的罪惡，比之帝國主義和軍閥還要大得多。因為帝國主義的一切施為，還可以有多少物質的建設，軍閥的地盤鞏固時，還可以保護若干茍且偷安的太平，惟有兒戲的革命，是沒有絲毫的良果，只有草菅人命，阻絕生機。……回頭是岸，努力　持，確真用科學的知識經騐，建設心口如一公正的三民主義的國家社會，然後中國可以免卻殘殺的浩劫，創造無限量的生機。」他又痛切自責並勉勵一般在政治上負領導責任的人們，他說：「看到今天中國的人民，這樣受苦，回想過去的言行，便不由得不惶悚起來！」「如果踏足在政治上工作，就要把一切貪心恨心收拾起來，時時刻刻以人民和國家的利害為利害，才可以救人救已。」</p>
<p>我們今天讀了戴先生這幾句遺言，就算沒有細味他遺著的全文，已不勝感慨繫之。今天中國人民的受苦，較之民十六，何止十百倍！今天政治工作者憑藉了他們的貪心恨心，兒戲革命，塗炭生靈，較之民十六，又何止十百倍！戴先生以一位革命先進，這樣悲天憫人，勸導青年，在我們這些後死的工作者，更應以大公至正的心胸，引導青年康莊的大道，萬勿走入錯路。在今天看來，這一條大道，無疑的還應該是一條用三民主義的磚石鋪築起來的「自由中國」的大道。</p>
<p>大家正在嚷和平，和平正成為絕頂時髦名詞的時候，筆者為什麼偏要向青年喊出「自由中國」的大道來呢？理由很簡單。因為我們所以要和平，是為了要生存，要生活；而我們人類生存時候的生活假使一旦失去了自由，那就成了奴隸牛馬，與死亡無異！所以「不自由，毋寗死！」一句話，早已成為西哲的名言。也許有人以為今天人民救死不遑，但求茍安偷生，於願已足，自由不自由，顧不得了。不見從前一些自由主義者，口頭掛着民主自由招牌的人們，今天在報館被封，報紙停刊的中共區域內，都絕口不談自由了嗎？假定這是正確的說法，那麼十二年前日本軍閥侵略中國，我們就不必堅持抗戰到八年之久，日人宰制下的中國，人民也還是可以生存的呀！而且，羅斯福總統當年所標榜的四大自由，（言論自由，信仰自由，免於匱乏自由），所以能成為大西洋憲章的骨幹，所以能為二次世界大戰中一切民主國家共同奮鬥的目標，所以能號召全世界愛好和平民主的人們一致起來打倒德義日法西斯集團者，也正為了自由乃人生所必需的緣故。因此，中國今天談和平，一切條件儘可斟酌討論，惟有全國人民合理的自由生活，絕對不許任何人在和平的煙幕之下輕輕斷送了去！誰在人不知鬼不覺的期間，出賣了人民的自由，以換取虛偽的和平，這和平一定是青年們所受不了的。惟其如此，中國今天的青年，應該下決心，永遠為一個「自由中國」的建設而奮鬥，不違目的，決不中止。</p>
<p>假定四月一日在北平開始的和談，雙方代表都真能如戴先生所說，痛切自責，「把一切貪心恨心收拾起來，時時刻刻以人民和國家的利害為利害」，那麼他們自由會想到如何維護人民應享的自由權利。否則，人民如果在和平的糖衣裏，嘗到了喪失自由的毒藥，遲早一定會起來爭取他們的自由的；果爾，這和平不過是爭戰爭的間歇而已。</p>
<p>青年同胞們，放眼看看全地球的現狀，你們正面對着兩個的世界的分野：——一個是民主自由的世界，另一個是極權專制的世界。中國人民，無疑的是愛好民主自由，而厭惡極權專制的。故中國不論和談的前途如何，是否光明，是否成功，而青年們之必須為「自由中國」而奮鬥，應該是指針確定的道路。因為，筆者深信，沒有一個青年願意在極權專制之政體下做奴隸的。</p>
<p>記得兩年以前，一九四七年三月十二日，杜魯門總統對美國兩院聯席會議作獅子吼，請求貸款希土，支援自由民族。他說：「幾乎所有國家必須在兩種生活方式中挑選一種。我相信美國政策必是支持自由人民，抵抗少數武裝力量或外力的統治企圖」。他更堅決的表示：「自由制度之摧毀，獨立之喪失，不僅對他們（指希土）有所危害，對整個世界而言，亦復如是。……世界各地自由民族，均期望我們的支持，以維持他們的自由。我們若果畏縮不前，則我們可能危害世界的和平，也必然將危信我們自身的福利」。這一次有名的演說，就是舉世所傳「杜魯門主義」的精髓。總說一句話，富於自由的傳統精神的美國人民與政府，是當今一切自由民族自治國家的支援者。最近大西洋公約的簽訂，和美國記者十六億貸款援助自由國家法案的提議，都是自由世界團結的號　。中國自推開滿清王朝以來，人民在三十餘年中，忍受一切痛苦和犧牲，無非為求一個「自由中國」的創造與保持，以　於自由國家之林，故在今天世界潮流的激盪中，愛國家愛人類的中國青年，當然要盡其全力，向着「自由中國」的大道邁進，而不容徘徊歧途。</p>
<p>爭取自由，不當僅是國民黨黨員之事，而是全國人民共同的責任。故今天我們的青年同胞，不問是國民黨黨員也好，青年黨黨員也好，民社黨黨員也好，甚而至於共產黨黨員也好，或者無黨無派也好，時至今日，都應回念過去，痛自懺悔，大家洗心革面，一致來為「自由中國」而奮鬥。只要誰不願做奴隸的，誰都就該團結起來，為爭自由而奮鬥。老實說，今天仔細思量，此二三十年中，各黨派間只知互攻互訐，而把共同體認的三民主義丟在腦後，把國家弄到如此糟，如此亂，究竟誰是誰非，不能一句斷定。但總可以說，這是因緣和合所使然，過去種此因，現在得此果。共產黨今天不必因勝利而笑，國民黨今天更不必因戰敗而恨，須知荼毒生靈，都已造了惡業，此二三十年中的糾紛，離合悲歡，變幻莫測，決不會是某黨全是某黨全非，也不會是某人全是某人全非，今天欲評判細賬，在和平談判裏來決定一個全是全非，於理於事，都不可能。我們所希望的，還是大家不必文過飾非，趕快從頭做起，給全國青年以一個「自由中國」的新希望，讓他們好在「自由中國」的大道上安詳前進。</p>
<p>假使雙方的和談代表，不明白上述一點的根本義，只為了求取「和平」的美妙名詞的實現，而漠視了「自由中國」前途的障礙，不為它披荊斬棘，或甚至反而牽着中國人民的鼻子走到極權專政的營幕裏去，則中國的青年們，終有一天會用他們自己的力量來爭回自由的基本人的權的。到那時，和平不又落了空嗎？所以，和平必得建築在自由的基礎上，纔是穩固。讓我們在青年節高呼「自由」！「中國自由」！以安慰戴先生在天之靈！（卅八，三，廿九，於上海）。</p>

<h3>經合津辦事處主任　奧維昨招待記者稱　復蘇華北經濟必須開放天津　中共猜疑心重致迄無成就</h3>

<p>此外，奧維對經合分署在津之五千噸麵粉及價值七百萬美元之棉布被中共當局強迫接收事，亦有詳盡報告，內空與報端發表者無殊。並謂，雖經多次抗議，迄未能使中共改變其決定。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕大西洋公約國家第一批外長可望於明日抵此，英外相貝文法外長許曼均可望於星期三抵此。英使館發言人謂，已代貝文與美國務卿艾契遜約定週五舉行會談，屆時將討論希臘土耳其及地中海之局勢。此間官方正等待葡萄牙之正式答應為大西洋公約之發起國之一。美京治安當局，現正忙於部署，以保護來此之各國顯要。官方透露大西洋公約決在國務部堂內舉行，准許在場者除簽字之各入約國全權代表外，僅各該代表之隨員及新聞記者。杜魯門總統將以來賓身份列席，儀式先後不致逾一小時。當公約入約國之外長來華盛頓準備簽字之後，蘇聯外次葛羅米柯亦將同時抵達紐約，準備出席聯大。大西洋公約雖不在聯大議程以內，但料蘇聯代表團必將設法在聯大中，發起辯論該公約及其在政治上之後果，果爾則本屆聯大必致愈加深東西集團間之裂痕，而達於不可補救之地步。一部份人士甚至預料蘇聯及東歐代表可以拂袖退出聯合國機構。本屆聯大原為賡續去年九月間在巴黎舉行第三屆聯大之會議，當時曾有一未決之法議案，要求在政治方面設法促進國際間之合作。蘇聯殊可於辯論該案之際，提出大西洋公約問題，指西歐聯盟及大西洋公約，與鼓勵國際合作之努力背道而馳。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕西方十國乃至十二國外長，日內將聚首此間，簽署大西洋公約，並展開西方團結之新紀元，一致對付蘇聯。各外長將嘗試就四大國際問題成立協議，卽（一）義大利舊屬地問題，其重心在於義大利廳否自聯合國獲得代管權，抑或採取其他方式之管理。（二）西德之團結與發展，此乃美英法三國外長討論主題。（三）大西洋區域以外之聯防問題，尤其是近東與地中海為最。英外相貝文已與希土兩國外長討論此問題。聞貝文並贊成設立東南亞反共機構。（四）在北大西洋公約下設立聯防機構，此事大約僅將作通盤討論，細則之訂定將在條約實施之後。</p>

<h3>蘇代表譴責英美建國外軍事基地</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿七日電〕蘇聯作曲家沙士泰科維區今日在文化科學界保衛世界和平大會之藝術組中發表演說，嚴詞譴責「企圖統治世界者」。渠並猛烈攻擊「若干國家瘋狂制造新型武器，在國境外數千公里之地點建立軍事基地，忽視旨在保障和平之國際義務與條約。」沙氏續稱：「彼等」拒絕締結和約之建議，發動有組織有計劃之造謠運動，俾準備與論自所謂「冷戰」轉向真正之侵略。蘇聯另一代表蘇聯影片公司董事長契勞萊發表演說稱：蘇聯希望在和平中生活，同時「並未在英法美國或其他國家之周圍，建立海軍或空軍基地。」</p>

<p>〔路透社維也納廿七日電〕英官方發表，英陸軍上士二名，在維也納蘇軍佔領之帝國旅舍外，被蘇聯衛兵踢打痛毆，兩人步行經過該地時，其中一人無意間步入蘇警戒綫內，蘇兵高聲呼喊，但彼等不解俄語，未予置理。一蘇兵乃奔前以槍柄猛擊，其他蘇兵亦自旅舍中奔出，將兩人痛毆一頓後，棄於路側，良久始被奧國警察發見。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿七日電〕美進步黨領袖華萊士今日就美國外交政策發表廣播演說稱，大西洋公約「適如一層簾幕，足以隱蔽蘇聯人民對美國人民要求和平之願望」。美國領袖利用「反共產主義」之口號，以隱蔽故羅斯福總統及故總統候選人威爾基所倡導天下一家之哲學。華氏續稱，國務院拒絕將入境護照，給予非共產主義國家之代表團，以參加現在紐約舉行之文化科學會議，實係執行一項「非常聰明而詭詐之政策」。國務院旨在證明僅共產黨對於該會感覺興趣。</p>

<h3>出售哈同花園空地　姬覺彌被控判決　確認買賣契約有效　刑事部份宣告無罪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕哈同總賬房姬覺彌出售哈花園空地，延未交割，所引起之糾紛，買戶黃子釗前向地院刑庭提起自訴，控姬詐欺，並附帶民訴。經兩庭數度審訊，昨由刑庭黃光鈺庭長及民族凌元慶推事分別宣判：</p>
<p>刑事部份　判決主文：姬覺彌無罪。其理由略稱：被告應否成立犯罪，當以其有無為自己不法所有之意圖，而以詐術使人交付財物為斷。查兩造在買賣地產所訂之契約內，中人保證俱全，已由姬之代表范雲展等到庭供明，姬確欲出賣地產，並無詐取之意。卽原訂契約第四項後段亦載有「如定賣人翻悔不履行賣買行為時，定賣人應加倍償還定買人之定銀，解除定約，並賠償一切損失」，縱有一方因故（姬因金圓貶值，延宕訂約）不願訂約交割，或可認為歸責於被告時，均係民事問題，與刑事上之詐欺情形，迥不相同，且在去年十一月六日，被告致自訴人復函末段「可到范雲展處取回定銀」之記載國，顯無蓄意詐欺之可言，故依法諭知被告無罪。</p>
<p>民事部份　判決主文：（一）確認被告之代理人范雲展，談伯亞，張海通，於民國三十七年九月十五日，以被告名義，與原告就上海中正中路哈同花園內空地，卽前工部局第二四三七號，地冊第一二一七〇號，英冊道契之一部份，約地五畝四分六厘七毫，成立賣買契約為有效。（二）被告應以本人就前開土地，與原告訂立買賣契約，呈請上海市地政局，過入原告戶名，並將前開土地，交付原告管業。原告提供担保金圓一百萬元後，第（二）項判決，准予假執行。原告其餘之訴及其餘假執行之聲請均駁回，訴訟費用，由被告負担。</p>
<h3>律師界意見</h3>
<p>按本案民事部份，旣經判決兩造所訂賣買契約為有效，被告姬覺彌是否上訴，目前尙未獲悉。據律師界談稱：該項約價款為金圓四十八萬元，買方除已付定金五萬元外，尙餘四十三萬元得付，因幣值跌落，去年九月間此數，與時值相較，在實際收益上，相差殊鉅，原堅持以金條計價之姬覺彌，自難接收。故於未來兩造依判履行之交割時，因幣值變動問題所引起之糾紛，恐仍難免涉訟，以求解決云。</p>

<h3>在孫夫人主持下的三毛樂園運動　散佈在全市的無數苦孩子　正期待着各界同情的援助</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「三毛樂園運動」在今天還是個新興的名詞，但是我預測，不久以後，它將膾炙人口。因為畫家張樂平手下的三行，是現實的，生龍活虎似的散佈在全上海，甚至全中國陰黯的角落裏。</p>
<p>孫夫人主持之下的兒童福利工作，就是以三毛為對象的慈幼工作。目前設立在膠州路等窮苦地區的，計有兒童福利站三個單位。受惠的難童計二萬三千餘人，其中包括賣報的，拾垃圾的，推橋頭的，以及要飯的小叫化子。</p>
<p>老少通　切實際易瞭解</p>
<p>兒童工作分教育，保健兩方面。教育方面現有識字班一百班，其中三十班是福利站所辦，七十班是家庭識字班，所謂家庭識字班的成立，全靠小先生制度的試騐成功。兒童福利站以陶行知「卽知卽傳」為教育原則，推行識字教育，發揚自助助人的精神。於是亭子間，擱樓，灶間……大大小小的識字班組織起來了。担任教職的，就是二年以前的文盲，在福利站苦學二年，儼然成為先生了。本來「卽知卽傳」的小先生制，是沒有年限的，現在兒童福利站為求訓練成熟起見，暫定為二年制，第一年純粹是識字教育，第二年卽是生活教育。教材自編，生動實際，易於瞭解。他們把它叫做「老少通」，二年餘來，已造就了二百餘名小先生。這些小先生的身世都異常悽慘，但是求知慾極強。</p>
<p>醫務營養兩重工作</p>
<p>保健方面，分醫務及營養兩項工作，每個兒童福利站都辦有診療所，義務替貧兒治療疾病，免費給藥。每天有二百多個兒童得救。為求普及計，並有活動治療隊，在棚戶周圍來去巡迴，替貧苦大眾服務。營養方面，現在有千餘苦嬰經常蒙受奶粉，魚肝油，維他命的滋補，這些皆來自經合總署，聯合國救濟集團組織。凡受惠嬰兒，個個經過福利站嚴格調查，他們珍惜物資，除非是孩兒真真需要，決不浪費一絲一毫。</p>
<p>八十幾個三毛開始</p>
<p>孫夫人的兒童福利工作展開迄今，不到三年的歷史，但是經過短短二年餘來的努力，收效宏大，成績輝煌。</p>
<p>開辦伊始，受惠的三毛僅八十餘人，迄今已擴展到二萬餘三毛了。但是孫夫人是決不以此為滿足的，中國的三毛太多了。而困難也就隨着來了，因為福利工作愈經展開，需要經費亦逾急切。就拿上海一地來說，就有數不清的流浪兒，他的期待着援救。為了推進福利工作，必須動員更多的人力和物力。就因為這樣，三毛樂園運動宣告產生了，孫夫人立志替三毛建立樂園，希望有一天，每個三毛都能進入天堂。可是這是需要大眾努力的，現在兒童福利生活正籌備徵求會員，徵求願意援救三毛的會員。照他們的估計，幫助一個三毛，每月需銀洋三圓。凡能認領三毛一名的，卽是普通會員，凡能認領三毛五名以上的，是屬榮譽會員。他們的目標是在四月底以前，可以徵求到五百個普通會員，也卽是說有五百名三毛可以因而得救。</p>
<p>流浪相劇可憐</p>
<p>為了使更多的人明瞭三毛窮困潦倒的生活，兒童福利站定四月四日兒童節假大新公司舉行三毛畫展，這裏面陳列了三百餘幅三毛流浪相。我希望你能抽空去參觀一次，那一定會覺得三毛是惹人憐愛的。那麼讓我們用大家的力量，把三毛樂園建立起來！</p>

<h3>丁治磐怒殺萬阿大</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者楊文育</p>
<p>在鮮州西區一帶，提起刑警隊探長萬阿大，真有些家傳戶曉的樣子，他的真名萬斌，倒反令人有生疏之感。畸形的社會時勢，把他從一個馬車夫造成到今天做起了泰來飯店的股東老闆，馬車行主，徒眾遍佈的「老頭子」，以至刑警隊裏五個探長四十多個探員中最有辦法的一個探長，誰會知道這個蘇州地界的「小聞人」新罪舊案會清算得這樣快，竟在丁主席一怒之下，於二十五日午夜一時二十分，被正法在蘇州車站的月台上，一般人是出於意料的驚詫，就連萬本人直到臨槍決前才知道已蹈了殺身大禍，悔之已晚。說這是「亂世用重典」也好，「殺一你儆百」也好，總之丁主席這次處置萬阿大的爽辣，實是對德惡勢力第一次無情的開刀。</p>
<p>十四年來充當探員</p>
<p>十四年前，萬阿大在偵緝隊裏開始了他的探員生涯，淪陷期間，一席做過隊長，曾為了椿案子險遭殺身之禍，勝利後又以萬雲龍的名字被人向法院控告漢奸罪，結果為給他四面八方的社會關係托住了沒有絆倒，當然，從這種環境裏竄出來的人，冤家對頭可也就着實不少，不過懾於他的威勢，沒有人敢出頭惹他，但不料為着一件小事，當萬被警局車巡隊扣押來的時候，告發他罪狀信的信也如雪片飛來，終於了結了他的一生，這種跡近於因果循環的事實，真是個發人猛省的教訓。</p>
<p>刑警隊的隊長，隊近在一個月前方由吳局長請了以前在上海老閘警局幹過很久的宋元衡和鮮承明兩人來接任，記者曾同他們談過幾次，他們感覺到在人與事的兩方面，處理起來多很辣手，蘇州地面小，人頭雜，而風氣敗壞，是最傷腦筋的。</p>
<p>西藥案件萬犯被押</p>
<p>前些時，刑警隊由萬阿大率領了在九曲里等處破獲了一件偽造西藥的案子，當一干人犯押在刑警隊裏時，宋隊長就下令不准接見任何親屬，不料萬阿大卻私自允許了一個時蒯大權的到隊裏接見了該案案犯張亮，湊巧被鮮隊附發覺，而且還在蒯的身畔抄出了一粒煙泡，宋隊長職責所在，就把萬阿大喚進了辦公室追究責任，誰知萬阿大對這位新隊長有些瞧不順眼，竟反唇相譏，幾至拔槍動武，事後宋隊長以萬如此目無法紀，乃將經過用電話報告吳警局長，於是吳局長就令車巡隊到刑警隊把萬押了起來，這稱風險，萬阿大看得很平常，他相信他是有辦法有把握跳出牢籠的。</p>
<p>告發罪狀接二連三</p>
<p>但是道一個機會卻給萬的許多對頭抓住了，於是告發他罪狀的信接二連三遞向縣府及警局，其中涉及的一件貪汚案是一個麵粉商陳瑞生姘識了一個唯亭夫人張王珍英，日久之後，張發覺懷孕，乃向陳糾纓，陳答應拿出一筆錢為張墮胎，這件事的居間人便是萬阿大，十六舊元金圓券了結以後，萬從中取得了三萬元的酬勞。又有人說萬在道件案子裏出演「仙人跳」，撈了數十包麵粉的代價。不管怎樣，這許多風聲早已傳到了丁主席耳裏，因此丁主席在廿三日來蘇出席三縣聯防會議時，曾為此大發雷霆，到廿四日由常熟視察江防歸來，在西美巷裕社宴請本邑各界人士席間，就對朱縣長說：「明天把萬斌槍斃了吧！」到了午夜時候，丁主席和保安副司令楊宗鼎擬專車返鎮，又不知怎樣一時心血來潮，就面囑到車站送行的朱縣長馬上把萬斌提到車站來槍決。丁主席這一個迅雷不及掩耳的決定，不知是不是怕神通廣大的萬斌或許會在他離蘇以後脫出這條性命，朱縣長奉令，立刻分電吳警局長和保安團孫團長，派了搜索排士兵，警戒森嚴地將萬阿大押到車站，萬阿大料不到他的死刑已在裕社裏給丁主席宣判了，也更料不到深更半夜就會走上了斷頭台，一路上他還顯得神色自若，和押送的士兵有說有笑。</p>
<p>臨刑慘呼長官救命</p>
<p>到了車站，吳局長請示主席如何處置，丁主席回顧旁邊的楊副司令說：「就這穠幹吧！」楊就提筆在萬案全卷上批了「奉主席諭地槍決」八個大字，隨後楊副司令就在黝黑的月台上，提審萬犯，到這時候萬阿大一看情勢嚴重如此，方知不妙，加上夜寒風緊，不免混身顫抖，當時楊副司令問過了萬斌的姓名年齡，就問他幹探長多少時候了，萬答稱已經十多年了，在萬想十多年的資歷該可以將功贖命，但楊副司令的想法也許正和他相反，於是一聲︰「帶下去」，只聽得萬斌拼命的驚呼：「長官救命！長官救命！」喊聲未絕，槍聲已起，萬阿大被速中三槍，就臥斃在月台的水塔旁，楊副司令監刑完畢，吩咐要露屍三天，以炯戒，旋卽登車向丁主席覆命後，專車方徐徐西駛</p>
<p>時勢造成的「英雄」，今天也給時勢吞沒了，成萬的人擁到車站看萬阿大的末日的情景！</p>

<h3>國行開始發行定額本票　救濟市面現鈔恐慌　先發五萬元一種僅限本市流通</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀錢信託業公會，鑒於最近市面現鈔缺乏，曾向國行建議發行定額本票，以資補救。茲悉：國行已於昨日開始簽發，本票計分五千元，一萬元，五萬元，十萬元四種。昨日先簽五萬元一種。該項本票，可代替現鈔行駛。鈔荒現象，當可藉此改善。</p>
<p>又據國行某機要人員表示：該項本票，須有業務局之襄理及科主任各一人會簽，方准以行生效。故目前限於簽章關係，一日最多簽發五百至一千張，事實上恐亦無法能澈底解決鈔荒，僅能稍戢現鈔之緊勢而已。故目前之發行，不過係一過渡辦法。又該項本票，係由中央印製廠以鈔券紙而製，較現行之五百元券長短各闊約半吋，週圍有灰黑之寬闊花邊，中為淡青灰色之圖案底，內嵌「中央銀行本票」六美術字，本票之另一面全白。昨發者均為五萬元面額之本票。惟以簽章關係，實際並未發出，而昨日中央印製廠送到之鈔券，亦已足敷分發各行莊之需云。</p>

<h3>棉紗漲勢銳厲　布疋展開買風</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市況，銀根與外象，仍屬利買，人心均告振奮，羣趨購吸，本街複製對細紗搜現殊殷，粵幫亦有另星納胃，各紗漲勢銳厲，平均猛竄三成許。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由五百四十萬元喊低至五百三十萬元為最低，午收復升至五百七十八萬元，較財富週末竟狂漲一百二十五萬元，三二支銀月最後接近四百萬大關，為三百九十萬元，激挺七十八萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨晨開二百八十三萬元，中途微小至二百八十萬，迄收穿出大關，至三百〇五萬元極頂，暴升六十一萬五千元，廠單午收站住三百萬元。二〇支雙馬猛漲六十萬元，以二百八十七萬元結束。他若金城及天女亦在二百八十萬元左右成交，一六支以下各級皆創空前新高，今日市場休假無市。</p>
<p>布市暴升，良以銀根益見泛濫，業內多單者甚眾，拆放乏人接受，兼之圈外均皆報挺，各方乃起搜購，買風頓見展開，執戶扳持少售，各布疊創新高。</p>
<p>龍頭細布晨開九萬六千元，中途曾低見九萬五千元，近午傳棉紗狂跳，同業猛吸，價乃節節喊高，旋穿出大關，見十一萬二千元之新高峰，結果較上週六激挺二萬四千元。五福與喇叭童細布最後均做九萬二千五百元，軋升一萬一千元。</p>
<p>四君子嗶嘰由九萬二千元一路晉至九萬七千五百元為最高，午收為九萬七千二百元，終漲一萬四千二百元。四君子元直貢站定十萬元關，一九〇高檔士林廠盤開二十二萬元，今日為民族復興節，布市場循例休假一天，明起照常集市。</p>
<h3>拋售紗布</h3>

<h3>桐洞上升</h3>
<p>桐油昨市雖因各方實銷式微，買氣懈怠，而以業銀根空前泛濫，業外物資突漲猛晉，尤以結匯移轉證之翱翔，益使人心向榮，貨方喊價續再上砌，迨至午後，比上週軋升萬元有奇，底盤依然鞏固，默察前途，仍有漲難弛之象。</p>
<h3>商會續電院部籲請　解禁限制紗布南運</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會為自前工商部限制紗布南運以來，因棉布滯銷之影響，將直接迫使紡織染工業生產陷入停頓狀態，關繫實鉅。昨特再度分電行政院曁經濟部呼籲，請將該項限額南運辦法，卽日予以撤銷</p>
<h3>茶市俏利</h3>
<p>昨日茶市南開卽以俏利姿態出現，行情躍登高峯，良以市上盛傳，浙，贛，皖，等產區，對今年尙未上市之新茶，俱在醞釀以白米衡值，抑且多須白米八石以上，換新茶百市斤，礉人心亟度亢奮，俄傾更因黃金美鈔又在領導各物上漲，茶葉同業不甘偃伏，遂亦跟蹤向榮，執戶一致漫天討價，過程旋再疾進。</p>
<p>本年溫州新龍井雖有扳抬者，惟在到源蟬聯中，卒感無力進級，聞同業拆價每斤仍為八千元，然脚地迂迴帶堅，而查本日交易，則以進方畏高，轉懷袖手，均乏躉額做開。</p>
<h3>市場散步</h3>
<p>— 看台客</p>
<p>漲風急速擴大本票火上添油</p>
<p>昨天，漲風普遍性地發展；漲勢，也超過一般人預料之上。</p>
<p>今天是休假，其實也是一個空隙。近數週的例假中，市面都會橫跳一番。如此大環境還在制造新資料，那末，更可以給大家一個「好看」。</p>
<p>物價必定要看齊的，所以經濟學裏有「物價水平」之說。</p>
<p>米煤連週猛漲，一般物價呆滯時，所以我們斷定其就會來一個全面性漲風的。可是，昨天漲風之猛，中央銀行發出大額本票，是有極大刺激性的。</p>
<p>五千，一萬，五萬，十萬，四種定額本票，無疑地，等於是五千，一萬，五萬，十萬元的變相大票面金圓券。</p>
<p>央行對於發行大額本票一事，曾聲明其理由是疎解現鈔荒。</p>
<p>近來因為現鈔短缺，所以本票支票，發生巨額貼水。市面需要現鈔，央行卻發本票，等於餓莩要吃飯，卻給他磚石。</p>
<p>昨天市面，一萬元本票或支票，聽說只能換八千元現鈔。</p>
<p>央行竟不想法增加現鈔供給，反增加本票來源；本票供過於求，貼水更要高漲。</p>
<p>央行此舉，豈不等於火上澆油。</p>
<p>若以為央行本票，不致發生貼水，我真不知何以曾「不致」？</p>
<p>若謂央行本票，可以立兌現鈔，所以不致發生貼水。那末央行何不爽爽快快發現鈔？何故多此一舉而發本票？</p>
<p>不發現鈔而必須發本票，用本票不及用現鈔便當，因為本票要到銀行裏去轉一轉，變現旣要費掉些時間，在此利息高漲時，貼水那能不發生？</p>
<p>薪資發本票若煞小職員</p>
<p>時值月底，發工資發薪水的時間，現鈔需要奇亟，央行不供現鈔，反供本票。因此，本月底每個人拿到的工資薪水，定然是多數發本票之類了</p>

<h3>番兵番將臨別挑戰　美聯華聯今夕火併</h3>
<p>美海軍培斐爾·麥令斯兩隊卽將於明日調防離滬，為示惜別起見，特聯合恩卡斯名將組成美聯隊，向華人盟主華聯挑戰，定今日下午七時半在市立體育館對壘，賽前另有插曲一場，籃委會迎戰又一，為避免擁擠起見，門票除樓上仍售五百元外，樓下略予調整，為樓下一千五百元，及場內開始發售千元。對號座上午十時起預售，其餘二種下午一時開始發售。體育館大門五時開放，屆時請四維童子軍維持秩序，今日原有聯賽三場，一律改期。</p>
<p>按籃委會委員，頗多球壇宿將如主席錢旭滄·隊長周濬·以及吳子彬·陳庸庵·陳渭源等，過去叱咤風雲，謝益欽·林作詩·亦頗剽悍，論實力非比等閒。又一參加甲二部聯賽以來，雖戰績平庸，但甚博球迷擁戴，毫下蘇石鳳·王學武以及衛禹平·張伐·金燄等，身手不弱，一旦與籃委老爺相逢，劇戰不免。</p>
<p>華聯蟬聯勝利後三屆聯賽王座，本屆錦標亦已穩得，橫行滬上，殊少敵手，在李震中·任相成領導下，阿弟·小樂子等老將新進，合作默契，而球藝熟練，技術精湛，更屬無庸多作介紹，今日勁敵當前，為保持令譽，必全力相搏。</p>
<p>美聯集麥令斯·培斐爾及恩卡斯三隊精華，長人利斯，黑炭勃朗，及泊透，伊卡特，克勒等，個個如生龍活虎，具優異技巧，卻利勃脫足智多謀，對華聯戰略，最為熟悉，更屬心腹之患。總之此次番將臨別紀念，傾巢來犯，抱有擊退盟主雄圖，可知來者不善，屆時中西雙強會師，精彩熱烈，如火如荼，必有空前盛況。</p>
<h3>今日籃聯一律展期</h3>
<p>四屆籃球聯賽今日原在甲組三場，惟恩卡斯及崇德均要求改期，同時因美聯向華聯挑戰，故決定全部展延。又卅一日甲一華聯對滬警之戰，亦予展開，並經主辦當局改排如下：</p>
<p>四月八日（星期五）</p>
<p>汕隊—晨友（甲二D）五時半</p>
<p>海青—恩卡斯（甲一組）六時半</p>
<p>華聯—滬警（甲一組）七時半</p>

<p>紅騎—（甲二D）五時半</p>
<h3>青年節慶祝球賽</h3>
<p>市體育館准上海各界慶祝青年節籌備會之邀請，定於今日上午九時起舉行籃球賽兩場，下午為兒童器械表演及兒童乒乓賽，籃球賽秩序：（一）新華—金剛上午九時（二）肇光—南模上午十時。</p>
<h3>民主盃今日揭幕　鐵路化身戰中藝</h3>
<p>市體育場為紀念青年節，特將民主盃高級組足球揭幕賽三星對中臨一場，定於今日下午四時在南市該場舉行，以資慶祝。查三星卽前日奪得市長盃之鐵路隊化身，且完全原班人馬，無一人變動，所異者僅球隊之主持人耳。故可喻為一個球隊，兩種番號。中藝雖為一陌生球隊，實則個個面熟，觀其陣容，可知卽是舊瓶裝新酒，三星以大刀闊斧，行動快速稱，中藝亦採大路踢法，甚少小型格調，雙方對陣可以別別苗頭。三星在南市聯賽中因　子文陸慶祥為新仙林助陣，未能展其抱負，此次二人重行歸隊，用意何在，不言可知。裁判員王琳巡邊員倪世耀方榮富，入場券七百元，二隊佈局如下：</p>

<h3>仁餘勇挫培斐爾　回力敗於麥令斯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨晚二場甲一組：（一）麥令勝回力，六十三比四十二，上午半廿四比廿二。（二）仁餘勝培斐爾，五十一比四十三，上半時廿八平手。第二場局勢較緊張，仁餘在最後四分鐘連獲十二分，獲得勝利，二千餘觀眾莫不得意忘形，聲震戶外。</p>
<p>麥令是一個快攻隊伍，在上半時回力各守本位，尙堪應付，下半時回力長力不繼，換上幾個小將們，祇能助陣，不能盡量發揮。於是在瘋狂進襲回力逐漸落後，卅七比三十後，一發不可收拾，回力雖經六次呌停，卒無補於事。</p>

<p>巴士勝中華兩球</p>
<p>星期六下着毛毛雨，比賽仍照常舉行。中華與巴士之役，因與亞軍有關，值得特別一提。是日雙方陣容，兩隊的左翼都有了變更。比賽進行中，巴士佔盡中場優勢。中華前鋒雖然迫門饒有危險性，可惜中衛綫因忙於掩護，卻完全沒有輸送前方的力量。再加之中華兩個內鋒不大回頭救助，遂常被巴士將陣容衝成兩段，如非門守余啓恩演出特佳，則巴士當不止負此兩球。</p>

<p>南南輕取大檯客</p>
<p>南華南對香港會之戰，雖說是雨戰，對雙方的控球本能，都沒有怎樣影響，祇是皮球濕重滑手，卻苦了兩個守門將軍吧了，南南所夫的一球，便是一個證明，卻不能完全歸咎在余耀得接到失手，而是由他脚勾進門內的錯過。至於大檯客輸的三隻卻並不冤枉，以南南昨天所的優勢來看，如果不是佛爺，黑仔因創傷新愈，處處小心，不敢勇猛衝陣，而失掉許多勝球機會，和「大舖廳」的十二碼球宴客的話，則大檯客最少有六球要輸的，並非過份之言。</p>
<p>然而「蓋官論定」，大檯客雖敗了，但並不踢得太壞，以基亞能與武倫的引綫穿針，所造成其前鋒初期蓬蓬勃勃的攻勢，是很夠危險的；但是不能否認的錯誤，是素充左翼的碧福，竟調到後衛去，圖拑制何應芬的進展，卻未免楚材晉用的弄巧反拙了。南南所勝的三球中，都是從左路找到的機會，京是大檯客是役慘敗的主因。</p>
<p>但長勝軍的保持不敗，也完全是技術上的應有戰果，攻守進退，都有美妙的演出，侯裕生雖在雨地球濕的惡劣情況下，仍有大刀闊斧，清脆玲瓏的踢法，及謝錦洪的坐鎮中堅，威風八面的丰度，都實在使人可愛，劉松生與張金海的演出，都較「督憲盃」一役「漸復舊觀」，佛爺與黑仔的復出，使球迷重見他兩美妙傳遞與無可捉摸的假動作，真是悅目非凡，二叔統領三軍，指揮衝陣，不讓少年，費春華的勉膺右輔，與朱錦成的「乙」材「甲」用，也算差強人意的了。但嚴格來看，南南前鋒仍脫不了緩慢不前的毛病，願今後能「勇敢」改進，才不致「功虧一簣」！是役雙方陣容如左：</p>

<p>雛鳳驕兵和光華</p>
<p>南華雛鳳與光華作　墻之爭，若以兩軍平素的演出來說，南華在這一役，本該取得勝利的兩分。可是在七十分鐘無精打彩的沉悶戰局結束了，光華竟能以三比三迫和雛鳳，真是一個「奇蹟」！</p>
<p>看上半場光華諸將的毫無戰意，毫無合作，尤以郭文添受傷離場，祇以十人應戰的劣勢下，「玩」來真像飛絮沾泥，簡直給雛鳳控制了整個場面，予取予携。還不夠十五分鐘，南華便贏了三球，由此可見當時的光華，是如何的不齊事。</p>
<p>然而繼續賽來，南華諸將已漸「復」「驕」態，卻不知這就是其應勝不勝的漏洞。反之，光華在郭文添復出參戰以後，全軍士氣昂揚，越戰越勇，終能接二連三，克復失地。在這場球賽裏，給予觀眾的，不是甚麼精彩緊張的過程，而僅是「驕兵必敗」的歷史教訓之重演。</p>

<h3>江南農村中的高利貨</h3>
<p>— 企年</p>
<p>連年戰亂，江南一帶，雖尙未直接蒙受砲火之災，然而農村經濟，已日趨崩潰。農民終年胼胝辛勞，所得的米穀，價格雖已令人咋舌，可是昇漲的速率，仍遠不及其他各貨。而民風方面，日趨奢逸，消耗費用，自然無形增加。何况主要的田賦，歲歲有增無已；兵役負擔，尤急如星火。所以在今日的江南農民，若非債台高築的，恐十不得一。</p>
<p>從前，典當是貧民經濟調節的機構，今日則因時代的轉變，已吿絕跡，所以手邊若短缺資金時，惟有出之於借貸一途。既有借貸，即有利息，在求借者多，出貸者少的局而下，遂釀成目下農村中形形色色的高利貸。</p>
<p>兩年之前，鄉間借貸，以月恩三角，視爲高利，借貸雙方，因當局曾一度出示嚴禁，格於怯令，錢鈔進出，且均秘密進行。可是不久以後，幣値銳降，出貸者雖取其重利，猶不足補償貶値的損失，於是有錢的誰也不願出借。思想一轉變，遂改以借貸實物爲主，如此可既保其本，復得其息，雙重利益，何樂不爲，相沿迄今，求借者雖飲鴆止渴，出貸者更得寸進尺，利息名目，遂有增無已。</p>
<p>最普通的，當推「粒半頭」，這就是說，借米一粒，於稻穀登塲後，連本還米粒半。在當今高利貸中，尙稱爲最輕的一種·此外類似的，有「粒六」，「粒七」等等名稱，換言之，若借米一石，則其利息須增至六斗或七斗不等，全視借貸時的供求關係而定。</p>
<p>上面的一種，一般而論，均有一週年大右的時間。至於短期性的，則有「月月打」一種，最盡重利盤剝之能事。譬如借米一石，其期限可隨借者的需要而定，但須按月償付息金一斗。此外，在新年時期，鄉村睹風甚熾，以米下注，目爲常事。賭負者往往想翻本，雖求之於借貸，亦不惜孤注一擲，其借貸的利息就更駭人，名之日「彩金」，大抵以日而論，每石利息竟須斗米之鉅，誠可謂嚇人聽聞。</p>
<p>算盤精明的債主，尙有所謂放「麥包子」的。意思就是說，鄉下人的小麥，雖尙在靑苗時代，可是已將它出賣給價主了，不過它的價格，往往低於市價一半，這壓低所得的利益，間接魷是利息。同樣性質的，尙有放「米包子」，其意義亦相同，不過以麥代米而已。借貸的時間前者大都在舊歷新正之後，後者在小麥上市前後，短短的三數個月，須對本對利。鄉農們爲了急用，口乾喝鹽滷，也顧不得許多了。據說，狠心的債主，利用「麥包」與「米包」的轉輾出放，獲利之豐，一年之間其實物竟有數倍其本者。</p>
<p>近來時局動盪，有錢的人們，對於放債一事，似已深具戒心。最近茶舖之中哭哭啼啼，窮人們幾有若貸無門之苦，在此情形下，即使再苛刻的高利貸，也只好含淚忍受了。</p>
<h3>鄕居所見</h3>
<p>— 許達三</p>

<p>石豪吏故事，衆認是厭戰文學的絕作。假如我有天才，則今日此情此境，決不會較石豪吏遜色。歷代關於兵役的記載，可謂慘酷之至。唐末藩鎭作亂。徧地烽火，梁太風在藩鎭時，用法尤嚴，將校有戰沒者，所部兵悉斬之，謂之「拔隊斬」。士卒失主將者，多亡逸不敢歸，太祖乃命凡軍士皆文其面，以記軍號。軍士或鄉里逃去，關澤輒執之送所屬，無不死者，其鄉里亦不敢容，由是逃者聚山澤爲盜，大爲州縣之患。</p>
<p>舊五代史劉守光傳，也在類似的記載：劉仁恭盡發部內，男子十五以上，七十以下，並黥其面，文曰：「定覇都」。士人黥其臂，文曰：「一心事主」。共得二十萬人，兵士之外，文人也不免，亂世慘事，實在令人心悸。前些時候，報載某地駐軍長官爲防止監犯越獄起見，曾令監犯於薙髮時，須於當頭留髮一簇，以示識別。留髮而不黥其面，比較起往事來，這位駐軍長官眞可謂文明得多了。</p>

<h3>紙鳶漫攷</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>開春以來，恒見兒童放紙鳶，興高采烈。予徘徊留連，竟不能去；自覺童心可覓，彌以自慰。歸而翻檢雜書，作「紙鳶漫攷」。</p>
<p>紙薦俗稱鴿子，齊梁時已有之、明陳眉公白石樵眞稿「辨風箏一文有云：「齊文宣高洋時，……誅諸元，……彭城王勰之孫曰韶者，幽於地牢，其從弟黄頭兒，命與諸囚自金鳳樓各乘紙鴟以飛，黄頭獨能飛至紫陌乃墜。……」獨異志云：「侯景圍臺城，（梁）簡文作紙薦飛空，吿急於外……」紙鳶之用，乃不第游戲，一以刑人，一以吿急。其後唐高駢嘗作風箏詩，有「夜靜弦聲響碧空，宮聲信任往來風」之旬。「詢芻錄」云：「五代李業於宮中作紙鳶，引綫乘風爲戲；後於鳶首以竹爲笛，使風入竹，聲如箏嗚，故名風箏」。然今鳶首無竹笛者亦號風箏矣。</p>
<p>復世有題風箏詩以託諷者，如宋莊季裕「鷄肋篇」載呂惠卿命一道士賦詩，以風箏爲題，道士應聲而作曰：「因風相激在雲端，擾擾兒童仰面看；莫爲絲多便高放，也防風緊却收難」。弦外之音，可以知己。明人有號睡庵者，亦有詩云：「飽看颶去情如紙，强與爭將命抵絲。莫爲風光都使盡，春風亦有下塲時」。無限感慨，眞可作警世歌。</p>
<p>昔人云：淸明後風力軟弱，不復爲此戲矣。吾常熟童謠亦云：「淸明放鷂，烏龜放鷂」。語雖鄙俚，然亦寓有樂不可極之意</p>

<h3>Negotiations Await Agreement on Procedures: Both Sides' Representatives to First Hold Preparatory Meeting; Government Requests Suspension of Military Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Government peace talks representative Zhang Zhizhong, at 5:00 PM on the 28th, in response to reporters' inquiries about the prospects of the peace talks, expressed optimism, his tone being: "I have always been optimistic." However, he declined to explain the reasons for his optimism. He also declined to reveal the procedures for the upcoming peace talks in Peiping and the government's handling of the CCP's eight conditions. Zhang stated: "I cannot comment on this, as I fear it will affect the progress of the peace talks. However, after the delegation arrives in Peiping, a preparatory meeting will be held first, so the procedures are currently difficult to predict." Zhang smiled broadly and showed little sign of worry during the conversation. When asked about the duration of his trip, Zhang had no pre-planned estimate. Regarding whether he would have to travel between Peiping and Nanjing for instructions, he said: "It depends on the circumstances." Regarding the discussion of war criminals and whether to discuss a ceasefire first, as well as the constitution and legal authority, Zhang appeared to find it difficult to explain.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Before the start of the KMT-CCP peace talks, Huang Qihan, the representative of Acting President Li in Peiping responsible for liaison with the CCP, frequently communicated with the Presidential Office. It is said that under Huang's communication, some issues have made smooth progress. About two days ago, Nanjing, through this bridge, proposed to the CCP to temporarily suspend military operations during the peace talks. This request did not receive a direct response, but responsible individuals believe that the fighting in Anqing near the capital, which has become apparent on the 28th, means that the Communist army in Anqing has already taken the initiative to withdraw. This is enough to demonstrate the CCP's sincerity in the peace talks, which indicates that the upcoming peace talks may have optimistic omens. Furthermore, future contact between the peace talks representatives in Peiping will be communicated to Nanjing every day, and any results obtained will be submitted to Nanjing for research and discussion before contacting Peiping again. On the evening of the 28th, an authoritative source stated: Currently, the Kuomintang is striving for unity and a unified will to ensure the smooth progress of the peace talks in Peiping. This unity and unification, the authoritative source believes, is very much in hand.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Peace talks representative Huang Shaohong arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong by plane at 5:00 PM yesterday evening and took a train to Nanjing that night. Huang declined to speculate on the prospects of the peace talks. Regarding the difficulties in the peace talks, he said: In his personal opinion, war criminals are a difficult problem, and the issue of military reorganization is particularly sensitive and difficult. However, the key lies in the sincerity of both sides. With sincerity, big problems can be turned into small ones; without sincerity, small problems can be turned into big ones. When asked whether the outcome of the future peace talks would be approved by the Kuomintang's highest decision-making body, he replied: "That has been the practice in the past." When asked about Guangzhou's view of the peace talks, Huang said he did not know but said: "The decision on a matter should be based on the majority, regardless of location."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Shizhao returned to Shanghai yesterday morning to attend to private matters and is scheduled to go to Nanjing again tonight, awaiting orders to fly to Peiping. It is said that the date for the peace representatives to fly to Peiping is either the 31st of this month or April 1st, depending on the weather. In the past two days, the peace talks representatives and the government authorities have had informal consultations, not, as rumored, participating in military meetings. The report that Xu Yongchang and Gu Zhutong attended the meeting is particularly inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] The government has formally notified the CCP that the peace delegation will fly to Peiping on the 31st. The Communist side has designated the Six Nations Hotel as the delegation's residence and has arranged wireless communication between Peiping and Nanjing. It is said that at the start of the peace talks on April 1st, the delegation will ask the Communist side to announce an unconditional ceasefire.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 28th] Government leaders were still busy meeting on the 28th. It is understood that preparations for the peace talks have been virtually completed. Acting President Li, Premier He Yingqin, and peace talks representatives are now scheduling meetings with legislators, supervisors, members of the KMT Central Political Committee, and members of the Central Executive Committee to solicit their opinions and achieve internal unity within the government.</p>
<h3>Presidential Office Held Meeting Yesterday: Presidents of the Executive, Legislative, and Supervisory Yuans, and Peace Talks Representatives All Attended; Discussions Focused on the United Nations and Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Amid preparations for peace talks with the CCP, Acting President Li convened a discussion meeting at the Presidential Office at 8:00 PM on the 28th, gathering the presidents of the Executive, Legislative, and Supervisory Yuans, as well as some legislators and peace talks representatives, to discuss various issues related to the peace talks. The peace program previously drafted by the government's ten-member committee was also presented again for item-by-item discussion, with attendees expressing their opinions extensively as a reference for the peace talks representatives' trip to Peiping. The meeting lasted until 12:00 AM. After the meeting, it was agreed that no information should be disclosed to the outside world. Reporters visited President Yu Youren and Shao Lizi to inquire about the content of the meeting. Both only stated that the discussion related to strengthening ties among the Legislative, Supervisory, and Executive Yuans, and the peace talks were also touched upon, but the content could not be revealed. Attendees at today's discussion meeting included He Yingqin, Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, Liu Jianhua, Qiu Changwei, Peng Zhaoxian, Wang Qijiang, Fan Yushui, Gan Jiaxin, Cheng Siyuan, Yin Shuxian, Huang Yuren, and Chen Kewen.</p>
<h3>Authoritative Source Discusses Peace Talks: Time Limit of at Most One Month</h3>
<p>Difficult Issues Still Require Instructions from Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to authoritative sources, the KMT-CCP peace talks in Peiping this time will last for at most about a month. The representatives do not have full authority and must seek instructions from Nanjing at any time when encountering difficult issues. There is no plan for the delegation to visit Xikou to visit Chiang before flying to Peiping. The government representatives did not bring a plan on this trip. The plan planned by the Ten-Member Committee has long been aborted in fact. Therefore, technically, the representatives are only responsible to Nanjing for each point of the agreement. How the opinions of other parties within the Kuomintang will be unified is a matter for the government and has nothing to do with the peace talks representatives. Shao Lizi's pessimistic attitude towards the peace talks stems from this, as he is deeply afraid that the peaceful views of the capital may not be accepted by other parties within the party. As for the outside world's deep fear that the CCP's insistence on eight points will lead to the breakdown of the peace talks, relevant people believe that there is no need to be overly pessimistic because "the CCP's market changes sooner or later." The CCP is the most realistic political party, and its policies are revised at any time according to the environment and will never take a dead end. Since taking over Peiping and Tianjin, they have discovered serious difficulties, so their attitude may have changed compared with two months ago. However, what is worth worrying about is that several military leaders of the CCP are strongly advocating taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reduce the remaining strength of the National Army to avoid prolonged peace talks and give the National Army a chance to recover. On the government side, even those who advocate peace the most often remember the maxim "only by being able to fight can there be peace." Therefore, the future of the peace talks will only be known after the talks begin. As for the recent military actions of the Communist army in Jiangbei, when the Shanghai peace delegation went to Peiping, the Chinese leader had stated: Even if the peace talks are reopened, he cannot restrict his military actions north of the Yangtze River, but he believes that the offensive to cross the river will not be launched during the peace talks.</p>
<h3>Friendly Encirclement of Zhang Zhizhong: Inquiring About News of Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Zhang Zhizhong held a tea party at Jieshou Hall at 4:00 PM on the 28th, inviting friends, about a hundred people in attendance. Zhang, as a popular figure in the current peace talks, was repeatedly surrounded by guests inquiring about news of the peace talks. Some even arrived without receiving an invitation. For a time, there was much talking and laughing, coupled with Zhang's humorous tone, creating a very harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Fan Yunong and Others to Suggest: Suspending Legislative Yuan During Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 28th] Legislator Fan Yushui and others are launching a proposal on the 28th, requesting the Legislative Yuan to adjourn during the peace talks. According to Fan, the adjournment of the Legislative Yuan will be conducive to the progress of the peace talks, as incautious remarks in the Yuan's meetings may affect the progress of the peace talks.</p>
<h3>Internal Affairs Committee of Legislative Yuan Reviews: Simplification of Provincial-Level Organizations Case</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Internal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th to review the "Simplification of Provincial-Level Administrative Organizations" case proposed by Meng Yunqiao and others. Luo Gonghua chaired, and Internal Affairs Counselor Wang Ting attended to report on the organizational status of the provincial government before leaving. The committee members began reviewing, agreeing in principle. However, regarding the second item of the proposal, "In the Communist-occupied areas of the province, where the provincial government has little business, efforts should be made to tighten up and reduce the burden on the national treasury. The four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction, and the Accounting Office need not be established separately. Only a Secretariat Office is temporarily allowed to be established to manage various affairs in sections, and other institutions "should be merged," they believed that the Executive Yuan should be requested to pay attention and recommended Zheng Zhenyu to report to the next Yuan meeting.</p>
<h3>Post of Political Vice Minister of Education: Plan to Invite Zhang Yi to Assume</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is rumored that relevant parties intend to invite Zhang Yi, the current president of Fudan University, to assume the post of Political Vice Minister of Education.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Dispels Intention to Resign: Supervisory Yuan Annual Meeting Scheduled to Close This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] After Supervisory Yuan President Yu Youren sent a letter to all supervisors requesting his resignation, all supervisors repeatedly and earnestly urged him to stay and requested to advance and retreat together to dispel his intention to resign. As a result, Yu dispelled his intention to resign on the 28th in consideration of the difficult times and to avoid causing unrest in the Supervisory Yuan due to his resignation. He personally went to preside over the Supervisory Yuan General Assembly. At noon, he and Vice President Liu Zhe hosted a banquet for all supervisors at the International Friendship Club. Each supervisor offered a toast to Yu, as Yu had dispelled his intention to resign. The guests and hosts were very happy, and the banquet did not end until 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] This year's annual meeting of the Supervisory Yuan is scheduled to close at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 29th. President Yu Youren will personally deliver the closing remarks. According to a secretary responsible for drafting the content of the remarks, the main point is to explain the Supervisory Yuan's wishes for promoting peace and innovating politics. As for the so-called legal authority issue, it should be decided by the people's opinions. In addition, the motives for his resignation and the process of dispelling his intention to resign will also be explained. After the closing of the Supervisory Yuan's annual meeting, each supervisor will leave Nanjing and return to various places. The Supervisory Yuan Secretariat has negotiated with the airline to charter three special planes to send each supervisor to Taiwan, Guangzhou, and Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Memorial for Revolutionary Martyrs: Central Government Holds Spring Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] March 29th is the Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs. The central government has scheduled a spring sacrifice ceremony for the war dead at Linggu Temple at 10:00 AM on the morning of that day. Acting President Li will preside over the ceremony, accompanied by civil and military officials of the central government in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Releasing News of Peace Talks: To Adopt Communique Format; Whether Reporters Can Accompany to Peiping Awaits Study</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] When Zhang Zhizhong met with reporters on the 28th, the reporters requested Zhang to allow them to accompany him to Peiping to cover the news of the peace talks. Zhang replied that he would discuss it with the CCP when he went to Peiping. If possible, he would welcome everyone to go. However, the release of this news will definitely adopt a communique format and be unified.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 28th] A senior official said: The government is considering suggesting to the CCP to allow Chinese and foreign reporters to go to Peiping to exclusively cover and release news of the peace talks, without restrictions or censorship, to avoid the CCP monopolizing the news of the peace talks.</p>
<h3>CCP Youth League: Strongly Attacks the United States</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 28th] The CCP on the 28th stood with the Soviet Union "in peace or war" and, amid calls for peace, launched new attacks on the United States. The CCP's broadcast in Peiping claimed that the Soviet Union was the only peaceful country. Whether this second attempt to end China's civil war politically since World War II will succeed is still not clearly optimistic. In Peiping, the CCP Party, the Youth League, strongly attacked the United States and pledged to fight alongside the Soviet Union in another war as a tribute to the World Peace Congress scheduled to be held in Paris in April. The Youth League stated that the League wanted to point out that "US imperialism is the main culprit in causing war." The League declared: The peaceful method is to "strengthen the democratic front led by the Soviet Union and fight with greater determination against the international reactionary group headed by US imperialism. The Chinese people and youth have established the closest and strongest revolutionary friendship with the Soviet people and youth in the past thirty years. Whether in peacetime or wartime, we will stand on the same front with the Soviet Union and all democratic countries."</p>
<h3>Candidates for Vacancies of Grand Justices and Examination Committee Members: Supervisory Yuan Has Agreed; Intense Debate Arose Due to Absence of Women</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Supervisory Yuan held a general meeting on the morning of the 28th to review the candidates for the vacancies of Grand Justices and Examination Committee members nominated by Acting President Li for the Supervisory Yuan's consent. The general meeting held a general meeting in the afternoon to exercise the right of consent. The voting results showed that each candidate received more than half of the votes of the attending members, obtaining the consent of the Supervisory Yuan. Chen Jianxiao's nomination as a member of the Examination Committee was criticized and opposed by the members, and he was almost canceled. Chen only received 56 consent votes, only three more than the required majority consent votes. Fortunately, he was approved. The results were immediately communicated to the Acting President in writing by the Supervisory Yuan so that he could formally submit the appointments. The list of Grand Justices and Old Examination Committee members nominated by Acting President Li and approved by the Supervisory Yuan is as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Justices (eight): Xia Qin, Weng Jingtang, Ye Zaijun, Li Haopei, Mei Ru'ao, Xiang Zhejun, Wei Datong, Su Xixun.</p>
<p>Examination Committee members (nine): Liu Yizheng, Zhang Qiyun, Gao Yihan, Chen Jianxiao, Ai Wei, Deng Hongfan, Ma Shiru, Shui Zi, Zhang Bin Sheng.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] At the Supervisory Yuan's general meeting on the 28th, when exercising the right of consent for the candidates for the vacancies of Grand Justices and Examination Committee members, the female supervisors expressed deep dissatisfaction that Qian Jianqiu (female), who had been agreed to be nominated in the original list of Grand Justices, was not included, resulting in no women in the entire list. Cui Zhenhua, Feng Yunxian, Lai Ying, and others stood up and spoke one after another in the morning and afternoon, strongly arguing that there should be a woman among the Grand Justices and that Qian Jianqiu should be added to the message and exercise the right of consent at the same time. The male supervisors opposed this on the grounds that it was not in accordance with the law, which caused fierce debate. It was not until 5:00 PM that the vote was conducted. Before the vote, the female supervisors made various efforts to persuade the eight Grand Justices nominated by Acting President Li to disagree with one person so that Qian Jianqiu could be nominated again. However, the vote count showed that all eight Grand Justices were approved. The efforts of the female supervisors failed again, and they left the meeting in anger before it was adjourned. According to a female supervisor who told reporters: "Yesterday Guo Dejie also told us that there was Qian Jianqiu on the list of Grand Justices. I don't know why Qian was canceled when I saw the message today. We women are always easily bullied, but we will continue to fight. As long as women exist, we women will strive for women's rights to the end."</p>

<h3>Expounding Thoughts on the Atlantic Charter: Zhu Jiahua Issues Statement: Says It Is a Positive and Effective Action to Win Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Mr. Zhu Jiahua recently issued a written statement expounding his thoughts on the Atlantic Charter, stating: Today, world peace is facing serious threats, and the safety and freedom of mankind have been shrouded in fear. This is because everyone in the past has ignored the danger of aggressive factors, allowing them to grow and spread, and even helping them, resulting in the heavy price paid in the Second World War, which only obtained an incomplete truce. Furthermore, after the painful war, everyone was obsessed with optimistic illusions and far-fetched discussions, procrastinating and waiting, and failing to take positive action to prevent the recurrence of war and protect peaceful methods, which led to the decline of the United Nations' prestige and failed to exert its righteous power. In the past four years, after painfully reflecting, everyone has gradually had a clear understanding, and because of potential and external aggressive factors, they have responded to each other, making all countries troubled by the concerns of their hearts and minds. The unprecedented seriousness of the danger is even more deeply felt. China has particularly deep wounds and can understand it even more deeply. The United Nations has repeatedly been unable to prevent acts of aggression due to the abuse of veto power. The Atlantic Charter clearly emphasizes the determination to defend democratic principles and free institutions and agrees on practical methods for collective defense and maintaining peace. It is a positive and effective action to win peace and can also be said to be the awakening of mankind to the current crisis. Therefore, recently there have been the initiation of the Pacific Treaty and the East Asian League. As understanding becomes deeper and more widespread, aggressive factors can be reduced, and mankind can be relieved from another catastrophe. Looking around at the international situation, it is becoming more open and beneficial to our efforts to win genuine peace. We should be encouraged to have courage, strive for reform, and move forward together. There will be a bright future.</p>

<h3>Serious Treatment Issues in Yunnan: Public Education Refuses to Receive Salary; Soldiers and Police Flee</h3>
<p>Lu Han Cables for Countermeasures</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 28th] Yunnan Chairman Lu Han recently sent an urgent telegram to Executive Yuan Premier He, Finance Minister Liu, and Sui Jing Director Zhang, requesting urgent countermeasures to stabilize people's hearts because the lives of public education workers in the province have fallen into desperation. The original telegram stated: The lives of civil and military personnel in this province are extremely difficult, and the public is impatient and cannot live a day. There has been a phenomenon of sluggishness. In order to avoid collective petitions, we have been reluctantly trying to raise half-opened silver coins since February, and each person will be given an additional relief fund of five yuan to maintain the current situation. However, the minimum living standard per person in this province requires forty to fifty yuan in half-opened silver coins, which is a drop in the bucket. At present, it is impossible to continue. Security soldiers and police are fleeing one after another, and public education personnel have initiated a refusal to receive salaries. The situation is serious, and the central bank is extremely short of cash and cannot allocate funds. At a time when bandits are rampant and people's hearts are turbulent, if countermeasures are not taken quickly, the future will be difficult to deal with. I am waiting for orders with the utmost urgency.</p>

<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3>The Road of Youth – A Free China</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>— Written on Youth Day as a Public Memorial to Mr. Dai Jitao —</p>
<p>Mr. Dai Jitao dedicated himself to the revolution, served the country with his writing, and his name will be immortalized. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was always concerned about the peaceful unification of China after the victory. On the 12th of last month, Mr. Dai passed away in Dongyuan, Guangzhou, and he must have regretted not being able to witness a new China of independence, freedom, peace, and unity after the war.</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the Huanghuagang Martyrs, and also our country's Youth Day. Comrades and friends in Beijing and Shanghai, because Mr. Dai loved young people the most during his lifetime, are holding a public memorial for this mentor of youth today.</p>
<p>I have devoted myself to the newspaper industry and am still young. I consider Mr. Dai to be the closest to me among the senior figures in the Party's newspaper industry, in terms of both literary and moral relationships, and friendship between teachers and friends, besides Mr. Ye Chucang and Mr. Chen Bulei. Since the victory, Mr. Chucang passed away first due to overwork, and Mr. Bulei fell into a long sleep last winter. Now, I mourn Mr. Dai, and I truly do not know where my tears should fall. I recall around the tenth year of the Republic of China, when I followed Mr. Bulei at the Shangbao newspaper on Wangping Street. Every midnight, Mr. Dai would always care for us, discussing matters extensively and expressing his opinions frankly, often staying late into the night until I finished my work, and then we would go together to "Sishi Chun" for a midnight snack and continue our discussions. This became a regular occurrence. Thinking about it now, it feels like a different world! Today, on Youth Day, I suppress my sorrow and offer a few words to my beloved young compatriots. I wonder if Mr. Dai's spirit in heaven will approve?</p>
<p>In the winter of the 16th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Dai compiled and published a small booklet titled "The Road of Youth" from the notes he took during lectures to students when he was the president of Zhongshan University, containing over 100,000 words. It explained his observations and experiences regarding national and party affairs at that time. (This book is currently available for sale at the China Cultural Service Society.) This book, along with Mr. Dai's other work, "National Revolution and the Chinese Nationalist Party," were widely circulated and recited by young people. Today, the reason why I want to talk about "The Road of Youth" is still to extend Mr. Dai's posthumous work and offer a few heartfelt words to young friends, targeting the current situation.</p>
<p>In the preface to "The Road of Youth," Mr. Dai said: "Revolution is for survival, not for death; it is to do real work, not to play games. The sin of playing games with revolution is much greater than that of imperialism and warlords. Because all the actions of imperialism can still have some material construction, and when the warlord's territory is consolidated, it can still protect some temporary peace, but only the revolution of playing games has no good results, only disregard for human life and blockage of vitality... Turning back is the shore, striving to uphold, and truly using scientific knowledge and experience to build a country and society of the Three Principles of the People that is consistent in word and deed, then China can avoid the catastrophe of killing and create unlimited vitality." He also painfully blamed himself and encouraged those who bear leadership responsibilities in politics, saying: "Seeing the suffering of the Chinese people today, reflecting on past words and deeds, one cannot help but feel apprehensive!" "If you step into political work, you must put away all greed and hatred, and always take the interests of the people and the country as your own, only then can you save others and yourself."</p>
<p>Today, reading these few posthumous words of Mr. Dai, even if we have not savored the full text of his posthumous work, we cannot help but feel deeply moved. The suffering of the Chinese people today is ten or a hundred times greater than in the 16th year of the Republic of China! The political workers today, relying on their greed and hatred, playing games with revolution, and wreaking havoc on the people's lives, are also ten or a hundred times worse than in the 16th year of the Republic of China! Mr. Dai, as a revolutionary elder, was so compassionate and exhorted the youth. We, as workers who died later, should use a fair and upright mind to guide the youth on the broad road, and never let them go astray. As it seems today, this broad road should undoubtedly still be a broad road of "Free China" paved with the bricks of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>When everyone is clamoring for peace, and peace is becoming the most fashionable term, why do I insist on shouting the broad road of "Free China" to the youth? The reason is very simple. Because the reason why we want peace is to survive, to live; and if our lives lose freedom once we survive, then we become slaves and livestock, no different from death! Therefore, the saying "Give me liberty, or give me death!" has long become a famous saying of Western philosophers. Perhaps some people think that the people today are barely able to save their lives, and only seek temporary peace and security. They are satisfied with this, and they cannot care about whether they have freedom or not. Didn't you see that some liberals, people who used to hang the banner of democracy and freedom on their lips, are now in the Communist areas where newspapers are sealed and newspapers are suspended, and they never talk about freedom anymore? Assuming this is the correct saying, then when the Japanese warlords invaded China twelve years ago, we would not have to insist on resisting for eight years. Under the rule of the Japanese, the Chinese people could still survive! Moreover, the Four Freedoms advocated by President Roosevelt in those years (freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want), were able to become the backbone of the Atlantic Charter, and were able to become the common goal of all democratic countries in the Second World War, and were able to call on all peace-loving and democratic people in the world to unite and overthrow the fascist groups of Germany, Italy, and Japan, precisely because freedom is necessary for life. Therefore, when China talks about peace today, all conditions can be considered and discussed, but the reasonable freedom of life of the people of the whole country must never be lightly sacrificed under the smoke of peace by anyone! Whoever sells the freedom of the people in a way that no one knows, in exchange for false peace, this peace must be unbearable for the youth. Therefore, the youth of China today should make up their minds to strive for the construction of a "Free China" forever, and never stop until the goal is achieved.</p>
<p>Assuming that the peace talks that began in Beiping on April 1, both sides of the representatives can truly, as Mr. Dai said, painfully blame themselves, "put away all greed and hatred, and always take the interests of the people and the country as their own," then they will naturally think about how to maintain the freedom rights that the people should enjoy. Otherwise, if the people taste the poison of losing freedom in the sugar coating of peace, they will definitely rise up to fight for their freedom sooner or later; if that is the case, this peace is only an intermission in the war.</p>
<p>Young compatriots, look at the current situation of the entire globe, you are facing a division of two worlds:—one is the democratic and free world, and the other is the totalitarian and autocratic world. The Chinese people undoubtedly love democracy and freedom, and hate totalitarianism and autocracy. Therefore, no matter how bright or successful the future of China's peace talks is, the youth must strive for "Free China," which should be a clearly defined road. Because, I firmly believe that no youth is willing to be a slave under a totalitarian and autocratic political system.</p>
<p>I remember two years ago, on March 12, 1947, President Truman roared like a lion at a joint session of the US Congress, requesting to lend to Greece and Turkey to support free nations. He said: "Almost all nations must choose between two ways of life. I believe it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures." He more firmly stated: "The destruction of free institutions, the loss of independence, is dangerous not only to them (referring to Greece and Turkey), but also to the whole world... Free peoples throughout the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms. If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world – and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own nation." This famous speech is the essence of the "Truman Doctrine" that is known all over the world. In a nutshell, the American people and government, rich in the traditional spirit of freedom, are the supporters of all free nations and autonomous countries today. The recent signing of the Atlantic Treaty and the proposal of the US reporter's 1.6 billion loan to aid free countries are the clarion calls for the unity of the free world. Since the Chinese people pushed away the Qing Dynasty, they have endured all the pain and sacrifice for more than thirty years, just to create and maintain a "Free China," to stand among the free nations. Therefore, in today's turbulent world trend, the Chinese youth who love the country and love mankind must do their best to move towards the broad road of "Free China," and not allow themselves to hesitate on a wrong path.</p>
<p>Striving for freedom should not only be the responsibility of members of the Kuomintang, but also the common responsibility of the people of the whole country. Therefore, today our young compatriots, whether they are members of the Kuomintang, members of the Youth Party, members of the Democratic Socialist Party, or even members of the Communist Party, or have no party affiliation, should reflect on the past, deeply repent, wash their hearts and minds, and work together to strive for "Free China." As long as anyone is unwilling to be a slave, they should unite and strive for freedom. Honestly speaking, thinking carefully today, in these two or three decades, the various parties only know how to attack and criticize each other, and put the commonly recognized Three Principles of the People behind their minds, and have brought the country to such a mess and chaos. Who is right and who is wrong cannot be determined in one sentence. But in general, it can be said that this is caused by the combination of causes and conditions. In the past, this cause was planted, and now this effect is obtained. The Communist Party does not need to laugh because of victory today, and the Kuomintang does not need to hate because of defeat today. It must be known that poisoning the people has created evil karma. The disputes, separations, joys, and sorrows in these two or three decades, which are unpredictable, will never be that one party is all right and the other party is all wrong, nor will it be that one person is all right and the other person is all wrong. Today, if you want to judge the details, and decide on one party is all right or one party is all wrong in the peace talks, it is impossible in principle and in reality. What we hope is that everyone does not need to gloss over their faults, but quickly starts from scratch and gives the youth of the whole country a new hope for "Free China," so that they can move forward peacefully on the broad road of "Free China."</p>
<p>If the representatives of both sides of the peace talks do not understand the fundamental meaning of the above, and only seek the realization of the beautiful term "peace," while ignoring the obstacles to the future of "Free China," and do not clear the way for it, or even lead the Chinese people by the nose to the camp of totalitarianism and autocracy, then the youth of China will one day use their own strength to regain the basic human rights of freedom. At that time, wouldn't peace be lost again? Therefore, peace must be built on the foundation of freedom to be stable. Let us shout "Freedom!" "Chinese freedom!" on Youth Day to comfort Mr. Dai's spirit in heaven! (38, 3, 29, in Shanghai).</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Search on the Border of Wujin and Danyang; Two Illegal Bao Chiefs Arrested; Yuan Shilin and Liu Changlin Executed on the Spot</h3>
<p>[Wujin Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] The local Communists have been active in the area southwest of Benniu, more than ten li from Wujin and Danyang.

<h3>Financial Chaos in Various Parts of Fujian; Gold Yuan Coupons Sometimes Refused</h3>
<p>Pacification Office and Provincial Government Issue Proclamations Strictly Prohibiting It</p>
<p>[Fuzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] Amid rising prices, the value of gold yuan coupons is depreciating sharply, and the financial situation in various parts of Fujian is becoming more chaotic. Transactions in the market in northern Fujian are all based on gold, silver dollars are prevalent in western Fujian, and foreign currencies are rampant in southern Fujian. Gold yuan coupons are sometimes refused. The Rong Pacification Office and the Fujian Provincial Government issued a proclamation on the 28th stating that gold yuan coupons are the current legal tender of our country and should be circulated and used in accordance with regulations. However, it has been reported that there have often been cases of refusing to use gold yuan coupons in various parts of the province, which has stimulated prices and disrupted finance. This is not the case. In addition to sending telegrams to various commissioner's offices and county and municipal governments to strictly prohibit it, all sectors of society are urged to use it as usual. If there is any refusal to accept, it will be severely punished upon verification. This proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge.</p>

<h3>Director of the ECA Tianjin Office, Ovei, Told Reporters Yesterday: Restoring North China's Economy Requires Opening Tianjin; Communist Suspicion Heavy, Leading to No Achievement</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] Ovei, Director of the ECA Tianjin Office, stayed in the Communist area for two and a half months after the Communist army captured Tianjin. Mr. Ovei arrived in Shanghai last Saturday via Japan with his staff member Moore Tao. He told reporters on the 28th: Only by opening the port of Tianjin can the economy of North China be restored. The Communists may be interested in reviving the commerce of the area, but because they are too suspicious of outsiders, they cannot accept the advice of experienced people, so there has been no achievement. The value of the People's Bank notes is also falling. The initial exchange rate between the US dollar and the People's Bank notes was set at one to eighty, but three weeks later, in February, it was revised to one to 320 yuan, and the current black market exchange rate is one to 650 yuan. The unemployment problem in Tianjin is very serious, and many factories are struggling. However, because the official regulations stipulate that workers who are dismissed must be paid six months' severance pay, they want to close the factory but cannot. After the Communists took over Tianjin, workers' wages increased, but because of inflation and the falling value of the currency, actual wages decreased; wages are also calculated based on the cost of living index, with millet as the standard. In terms of industry, Tianjin's textile factories have all started operating. The attached cotton fields have accumulated two years of harvest. In the past, due to the war, the city and countryside were separated and could not be used. Now, raw cotton is being shipped into Tianjin, which can be used for six to eight months. Among the seven factories of the Spinning and Construction Company in Tianjin, the one with the newest equipment was unfortunately destroyed by the war, but the remaining six factories and four private factories have all resumed operations, and the Communists have not taken over the private factories.</p>
<p>In addition, Ovei also gave a detailed report on the ECA's 5,000 tons of flour and US$7 million worth of cotton cloth in Tianjin being forcibly taken over by the Communist authorities. The content is no different from what has been published in the newspapers. He also said that although he protested many times, he has not been able to get the Communists to change their decision.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After spending the weekend here, US Ambassador Stuart Redman returned to Beijing by plane yesterday morning. During his stay in Shanghai, the ambassador met with Ovei and Moore, representatives of the US ECA who had recently withdrawn from Tianjin to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] The Communist radio broadcast news from Tianjin: The Tianjin Municipal Trade Company was officially established on the 24th, and Wang Wenbo has been appointed as the manager and He Fazhang as the deputy manager. It has three professional companies under it: grain, cotton cloth, and department stores.</p>

<h3>Yongshui City in Western Hunan Captured by Miao Bandits</h3>
<p>[Changsha Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] Qianyang was lost, and the bandits set fire to the city. The streets outside the east, south, and north gates of the city were all reduced to ashes. Looting and rape were no different from Yuan. After the rebellious bandits captured the city, they continued to disturb Hongjiang. On the 27th, they infiltrated Dahongpo, two li away from Hongjiang. Chen Yuxin, commissioner of the tenth district, said that he would coexist with Hongjiang (Note: Hongjiang is one of the major towns in western Hunan, and its commercial scale is comparable to that of Changde, Xiangtan, and Hengyang). The Miao bandit leader who attacked Yongshui was Wu Hengliang, with nearly a thousand people. After the defending team guarded the city for eight days and nights, they ran out of ammunition and supplies, and the city finally fell. Dai Jitao, a provincial committee member who was ordered to go to Yuan to guide, recently signed a petition to Chairman Cheng to resign from the provincial committee.</p>
<h3>Guizhou Medical Students Petition to Sell Goods for Charity to Help Teachers</h3>
<p>Guilin University Professors on Hunger Strike</p>
<p>[Guiyang Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] The Gui University students had just returned to school yesterday. More than 300 students from the Guiyang Medical College lined up at the Provincial Government at 10 AM on the 27th to petition. Chairman Gu received them and agreed to issue another month's worth of subsidized rice to teachers and staff, as in the case of Gui University, and asked the Provincial Government to certify the actual price of the rice purchased by public-funded students and send a telegram to the Ministry of Education to issue it truthfully. The students left satisfied. But in the afternoon, they conducted a charity sale on the street to raise living expenses for teachers and staff. In addition, the joint association of professors from Gui University, Gui Medical College, and Gui Teachers College decided on the 27th that the colleges and universities would painfully maintain classes for two more weeks and send a telegram to the Ministry of Education to seek relief quickly, otherwise they would go on strike for a long time.</p>

<h3>Atlantic Pact to be Signed Early Next Month; US Senate Decides to Postpone Discussion; Approval Possibly Delayed Until Summer This Year; Foreign Ministers of Various Western European Countries Arrive in US One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Washington, 28th Broadcast: Senate Democratic leader Lucas stated in a White House meeting with Secretary of State Acheson that the North Atlantic Pact has been placed at the end of the Senate's agenda today, and hinted that the pact may be delayed until summer this year for approval. Lucas said that numerous unresolved domestic bills will be discussed first. Lucas was one of the congressmen who attended Truman's weekly meeting on Monday. Lucas said Acheson attended the meeting to discuss the legislative procedures after the signing of the Atlantic Pact.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] New York, 28th Broadcast: Italian Foreign Minister Sforza flew from Europe to New York this morning to prepare for the signing of the North Atlantic Pact. According to airline staff, Sforza will travel to Washington on the evening of the 28th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] The first group of foreign ministers from the Atlantic Pact countries are expected to arrive here tomorrow. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Schuman are both expected to arrive here on Wednesday. A British Embassy spokesman said that Bevin has already arranged a meeting with US Secretary of State Acheson on Friday to discuss the situation in Greece, Turkey, and the Mediterranean. Local officials are awaiting Portugal's official response to be one of the founding countries of the Atlantic Pact. Security authorities in Washington are currently busy deploying to protect the visiting dignitaries. Officials revealed that the Atlantic Pact will be held in the State Department building. Allowed to attend will be only the plenipotentiaries of each signatory country, as well as their staff and journalists. President Truman will attend as a guest. The ceremony will not last more than an hour. As the foreign ministers of the Atlantic Pact countries arrive in Washington to prepare for the signing, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko will also arrive in New York at the same time to attend the UN General Assembly. Although the Atlantic Pact is not on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, it is expected that the Soviet delegation will try to initiate a debate on the pact and its political consequences in the General Assembly. If this happens, the current General Assembly will inevitably deepen the rift between the East and West blocs to an irreparable point. Some even predict that the Soviet and Eastern European representatives may walk out of the United Nations organization. The current General Assembly is a continuation of the meeting of the Third General Assembly held in Paris last September. At that time, there was an unresolved legal proposal requesting to find ways to promote international cooperation in the political field. The Soviet Union may raise the issue of the Atlantic Pact during the debate on the case, pointing out that the Western European Union and the Atlantic Pact run counter to efforts to encourage international cooperation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] The foreign ministers of ten or even twelve Western countries will gather here in the coming days to sign the Atlantic Pact and usher in a new era of Western solidarity to counter the Soviet Union. The foreign ministers will try to reach agreements on four major international issues: (1) the issue of the former Italian territories, with the focus on whether Italy will obtain trusteeship from the United Nations or adopt other forms of management; (2) the unity and development of West Germany, which is the main topic of discussion between the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France; (3) the issue of joint defense outside the Atlantic region, especially the Near East and the Mediterranean; British Foreign Secretary Bevin has already discussed this issue with the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey. It is heard that Bevin also supports the establishment of an anti-communist organization in Southeast Asia; (4) the establishment of a joint defense organization under the North Atlantic Pact, which will only be discussed in general, and the details will be determined after the treaty is implemented.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th] Wallace, leader of the American Progressive Party, delivered a radio speech today on American foreign policy, saying that the Atlantic Pact is "like a curtain, enough to conceal the Soviet people's desire for peace with the American people." American leaders are using the slogan of "anti-communism" to conceal the philosophy of One World advocated by the late President Roosevelt and the late presidential candidate Willkie. Wallace continued that the State Department's refusal to grant entry passports to delegations from non-communist countries to attend the Cultural Science Conference currently being held in New York is implementing a "very clever and cunning policy."

(2) Basic mineral products: steel, cement, machinery and electricity. (3) Export materials: pig bristles, tung oil, raw silk, frozen eggs, tea. (3) Production enterprises that meet the requirements of the preceding article shall fill out the Central Bank Lending Committee's order loan application form, listing the products, various manufacturing costs, and manufacturing specifications in detail. They shall also include the most recent balance sheet and profit and loss statement in quadruplicate, and send them to the national banks for review and forwarding, or directly to the Central Bank Lending Committee for application. (4) After the Central Bank Lending Committee approves the quantity and term of the order loan applied for by the production enterprise, it shall notify the applicant in writing to contact the designated bank for loan procedures.

<h3>Bathing Industry Price Basis Problem; Representatives Express Difficulties; Social Bureau Promises to Find a Solution</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] After the problem of the haircut price basis was resolved, the bathing industry, due to more complicated circumstances, has not yet resolved the basis problem. Yesterday afternoon, the Social Bureau convened representatives of the industry's guild, including executive directors Shu Taigang and Yang Yilong. According to Shu et al.: The industry has a total of 128 businesses, divided into three grades of special class, three grades of A class, and three grades of B class, for a total of three classes and nine grades. The opinions of the bathhouses of various members are extremely inconsistent, and most of them oppose calculating based on the cost of living index. The difficulty for the industry is that the price of fuel has risen too high. The bran and straw used now are calculated in rice, and the market price differs in the morning and evening, and the Social Bureau does not allocate fuel. Other items such as towels, tea, soap, water and electricity are also consumed in large quantities. Commodity prices rise almost every day. The industry is currently adjusting prices at any time based on the prices of fuel and other items, with each increase being about 30-40%. After the board of directors has decided, it notifies the member bathhouses to implement it. If the price is adjusted according to the cost of living index twice a month, the cost of living index will inevitably jump one fold after it is published, and business will be greatly affected. On the eve of the publication of the cost of living index, it will inevitably be overwhelmed again. They do not want to see this phenomenon and hope for a slow increase. Section Chief Xi instructed after they expressed their difficulties: The industry still needs to quickly draft a basis based on pre-war prices for review. If there are any difficulties, the Social Bureau will assist as much as possible, and technical problems can be solved. Shu et al. will convene a joint meeting of the industry's board of directors and supervisors within the next few days to make a decision.</p>

<h3>University President Conference: Minister of Education Attends and Delivers Speech, Announces Open-minded Approach</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Association of Universities and Colleges held its 23rd meeting yesterday afternoon at the Tsinghua Alumni Association, with more than 30 presidents of public and private universities and colleges in attendance. The newly appointed Minister of Education, Hang Liwu, was invited to attend and deliver a speech, which roughly stated: "Because of his firm refusal being unsuccessful, he reluctantly took office. During this difficult time, if one wants to talk about rectifying education, one can only do what is within one's capabilities and cannot expect too much. Currently, issues such as increasing education funding, improving the treatment of faculty and staff, improving students' lives, and resettling refugee students are all urgently awaiting resolution, especially the issue of funding. In the future, the Ministry of Education hopes to have a new democratic and free approach in its administration, trusting the presidents of each school, adopting a tiered responsibility system, and not waiting for the Ministry of Education to resolve everything, so as not to delay efficiency due to the back-and-forth of official documents. Education belongs to everyone and is a whole. Although there are many difficulties at present, since I have accepted the position, I am determined to do my best and bravely face them. I hope that the presidents of each school can understand and provide more help and cooperation." At this point, Minister Hang stated that he still had many things to report, but because there were outsiders (referring to reporters) present, he did not want to say more.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, the president of Fudan University, praised Minister Hang's statement that he fully trusted the administrative authorities of each school, calling it an enlightened approach. Wang Yuxiang, the vice president of Daxia University, believed that education is a whole, and that in the past, private schools were like illegitimate children. He hoped that the Ministry of Education would take care of both public and private schools in the future. Sheng Zhenwei, the dean of the Soochow University Law School, pointed out that the Ministry of Education's review of the qualifications of university graduates had been delayed for more than a year or two and diplomas had not yet been issued. He hoped that this could be improved in the future.</p>
<h3>Professors Make Three Demands; Minister Agrees to Increase Research Funding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister Hang invited Chen Wangdao, Liu Dajie, and Cao Hesun, the three executive directors of the Shanghai National University and College Professors Association, to a meeting at 6 p.m. yesterday. The three representatives gave a detailed explanation of the previous trip to Beijing to ask Acting President Li for improved treatment, and reported on the association's five representatives' petition in Beijing. They also made three demands to Minister Hang in person: (1) Starting in February, the salaries of faculty and staff should be calculated according to the current month's price index without any deductions. (2) The 500-fold increase issued at the beginning of this month should be used as part of the salary supplement for February and should not be deducted from the salary in March. (3) Please increase academic research funding again. Minister Hang replied that the first two points would be considered after returning to Beijing. The third point, academic research funding, could be increased, but the amount was yet to be determined.</p>
<h3>Minister of Education Visited President Liu Before Going to Beijing</h3>

<h3>Coal Shortage on Both Railways Resolved; National Bank Agrees to Advance Coal Funds: 7,000 Tons Every Ten Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has been severely affected by the government's military and public transportation and the sluggish business in recent months, and its financial situation is extremely tight. Moreover, due to the separation of the north and south, the source of coal has been drastically reduced, and coal prices have soared. The Railway Bureau's turnover is not flexible, and it is unable to purchase coal, which has caused a serious coal shortage on both railways. Wang Zhaohuai, the director of the bureau, has repeatedly gone to Beijing to request relief from the Ministry of Communications. It was heard yesterday that the Central Bank authorities have agreed to provide long-term loans for coal funds for both railways. The National Bank will advance 7,000 tons of coal funds every ten days, and then the Railway Bureau will gradually repay the funds. The coal shortage on both railways can be said to be completely resolved.</p>
<h3>Lack of Cash Affects Salary Payments; Social Bureau Director Makes Two Recommendations to National Bank</h3>
<p>According to Cao Peizi, the director of the Social Bureau, who met with reporters yesterday: The next issue of the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Cost of Living Index for this month will be published soon, but the shortage of cash in the city has not improved. After the previous issue of the Cost of Living Index was published this month, some factories issued wages in the form of bank drafts, which workers could not use, resulting in disputes. In view of the above situation, Cao made a special trip to the Central Bank yesterday morning to meet with Director Lin Chongyong to discuss the issue of cash for factories to pay wages. Cao said that there are about 500,000 workers in the city. Assuming an average monthly salary of 25 yuan per person for half a month, and the Cost of Living Index is 3,000 times, then 45 billion yuan is needed. If workers are paid with bank drafts, the impact would be enormous. Cao also explained the seriousness of the issue and suggested that the Central Bank should indicate on the checks when factories pay wages to facilitate endorsement, and relax the withdrawal limit or issue silver dollars so that workers' lives are not affected by the lack of cash for salary payments. According to Cao, Director Lin has paid attention to this issue.</p>

<h3>An Organization Will Be Established in Shanghai to Handle Refugee Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since refugee students from the Northeast and North China have come to Shanghai one after another, the Municipal Education and Social Affairs Bureaus have found it difficult to handle this matter because the Ministry of Education has no responsible organization in Shanghai.

<h3>Gang of Thieves Haunting Zhabei and Nanshi Caught</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At about 8:50 p.m. on the 24th, four thieves suddenly came to the Hongxing Restaurant at No. 120 Hongxing Road, Zhabei. They entered the restaurant and took their seats under the pretext of having a meal. Suddenly, they pulled out guns, prohibiting any noise. In about ten minutes, they robbed three gold rings and a pair of earrings and escaped. A guest, Chai Tingguan, followed them to Songyuan Road. Because the road was dark and without lights, he was afraid of being harmed, so he turned back to the North Railway Station General Bureau and reported the incident, requesting an arrest. Yao Zhilong, the chief of the criminal section of the branch bureau, was ordered by Yao, the director of the branch bureau, to supervise the section members Zhang Shangqing, police officers Shao Shanxiang, Shi Chengyu, Gao Fuhou, Bao Jimin, etc., to investigate in all directions. After a day and night, they learned that one of the perpetrators lived in a small grass shed on Songyuan Road. At 6 a.m. the next morning, they secretly deployed a police cordon at the location and caught the thief Chen Dongshun. They took him back to the bureau for interrogation, and he confessed his accomplices, saying that they were selling stolen gold jewelry. They dispatched personnel again and arrested Li Shucai, Cai Dekang, and Chen Kaigui at the Xintianhua Gold Shop on Baoshan Road. A loaded pistol, four bullets, and two stolen gold rings were seized from Cai. They confessed that they had two box guns, which were placed with Zhai Guangfu and Gao Lishu. They immediately went to the addresses and arrested Zhai Guangfu, and seized two hand grenades from the fugitive Chen Jiashun. According to Zhai's confession, Zhu Changgen was arrested, and a pistol was seized. Another accomplice, Li Debao, was hiding in the Datong Public Office at the bottom of Yangshupu. He was also arrested and brought to the bureau. In addition, Wang Hongxing was arrested and a box gun and seven bullets were seized. Another accomplice, Huang Qi, is still at large. The gang of thieves confessed to having committed as many as 16 robbery cases in the Zhabei and Nanshi areas. They have applied to the District Procuratorate for an extension of their detention and will report the case to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation after the case is clarified.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Flying Fortress Third Team was ordered to carry out a surprise inspection late last night. As a result, a thief was found on Feihong Road in Tilanqiao. A six-inch pistol was found on the spot. According to the suspect, his name is Cheng Ruixiang. Details are still under investigation.</p>

<h3>Tianyaoqiao Theft Case; Two Perpetrators Arrested Based on Tire Tracks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 9 p.m. on the 20th, 720 kilograms of cotton, two dan of rice, swimming money, a gold ring, and a suit of clothes, worth a total of more than two million gold yuan, were stolen from Gong Chunquan's home at 87 Zhaoxiang, Tianyaoqiao, Huxi. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the Xujiahui Police Branch. Huang Yucong, the section chief, led the section members Huang Guozhen, police officers Ling Zi'ao, Jin Zhongxiong, Han Jun, etc., to investigate. They found tire tracks on the road and believed that Mao Lingen, a resident of 19 Zhaoxiang, was a major suspect, because Mao had a rubber car, and the width of the wheels matched the tire tracks left on the road. Therefore, he was arrested and taken to the bureau for questioning. He confessed that he had colluded with four accomplices, Yang Jinfa, Hu Junyu, and Cai Faxiang, to commit the theft because of gambling debts. Yang Jinfa was also arrested, and the others are still at large. Five large packages of stolen cotton, weighing more than 600 kilograms, were recovered from the Bailu Tea Garden on Xinma Road, Xietu Road. The perpetrators were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation.</p>
<h3>Judgement on the Case of Ji Juemi Being Sued for Selling Empty Land in Hardoon Garden: Sales Contract Confirmed Valid; Criminal Part Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The dispute caused by Ji Juemi, the chief accountant of Hardoon, selling empty land in Hardoon Garden but delaying the handover, and the buyer Huang Zizhao filing a private prosecution with the District Court's Criminal Division, accusing Ji of fraud, with an accompanying civil lawsuit. After several trials by the two divisions, the criminal division, Judge Huang Guangyu, and Judge Ling Yuanqing of the civil division announced their verdicts yesterday:</p>
<p>Criminal Part: Ruling: Ji Juemi is not guilty. The reasoning roughly stated: Whether the defendant is guilty of a crime should be determined by whether he had the intent to illegally possess the property and used fraud to induce others to hand over the property. The contract signed by both parties in the real estate transaction, with all the brokers' guarantees, has been confirmed by Fan Yunzhan, Ji's representative, in court that Ji indeed wanted to sell the property and had no intention of fraud. Even the last part of item 4 of the original contract states: "If the seller regrets and does not perform the sales act, the seller shall return double the deposit to the buyer, terminate the contract, and compensate for all losses." Even if one party is unwilling to sign the contract and hand over the property due to reasons (Ji delayed the contract due to the depreciation of the gold yuan), it can be considered attributable to the defendant and is a civil matter, which is completely different from the criminal situation of fraud. Moreover, in the last paragraph of the reply letter sent by the defendant to the plaintiff on November 6 last year, "You can go to Fan Yunzhan to retrieve the deposit" indicates that there was no intentional fraud, so the defendant was declared not guilty in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Civil Part: Ruling: (1) The contract signed by the defendant's agents Fan Yunzhan, Tan Boya, and Zhang Haitong, on behalf of the defendant, and the plaintiff on September 15, 1948, for the sale of the empty land in Hardoon Garden on Zhongzheng Middle Road, Shanghai, i.e., part of No. 2437 of the former Public Works Department, Land Register No. 12170, British Register, approximately 5 mu, 4 fen, 6 li, and 7 hao, is valid. (2) The defendant shall, in his own name, sign a sales contract with the plaintiff for the aforementioned land, submit it to the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau, transfer it to the plaintiff's name, and hand over the aforementioned land to the plaintiff for management. After the plaintiff provides a security deposit of 1 million gold yuan, the (2nd) ruling is approved for provisional execution. The plaintiff's other claims and applications for provisional execution are rejected, and the litigation costs are borne by the defendant.</p>
<h3>Lawyers' Opinions</h3>
<p>According to the lawyers, since the civil part of the case has ruled that the sales contract signed by both parties is valid, it is not yet known whether the defendant Ji Juemi will appeal. According to lawyers, the contract price is 480,000 gold yuan. In addition to the 50,000 yuan deposit that the buyer has already paid, 430,000 yuan remains to be paid. Due to the depreciation of the currency, this amount in September of last year is vastly different from the current value in terms of actual income. Ji Juemi, who originally insisted on pricing in gold bars, will inevitably find it difficult to accept. Therefore, when the two parties perform the handover in accordance with the judgment in the future, disputes caused by the currency value change may still be unavoidable in order to seek a solution.</p>

<h3>Under Mrs. Sun Yat-sen's Auspices: The San Mao Paradise Movement - Countless Suffering Children Across the City Await Compassionate Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The "San Mao Paradise Movement" is still a nascent concept today, but I predict that it will soon become a household name. This is because San Mao, from the hand of artist Zhang Leping, is a realistic figure, a lively presence scattered throughout the dark corners of Shanghai, and even all of China.</p>
<p>The child welfare work led by Mrs. Sun Yat-sen takes San Mao as its target for charitable work for children. Currently, there are three child welfare stations established in impoverished areas such as Jiaozhou Road. Over 23,000 displaced children benefit from this, including newspaper sellers, garbage collectors, bridge attendants, and begging children.</p>
<p>Easy to Understand for All Ages and Practical</p>
<p>Child welfare work is divided into two aspects: education and healthcare. In education, there are currently 100 literacy classes, 30 of which are run by welfare stations, and 70 are family literacy classes. The establishment of family literacy classes relies entirely on the successful experimentation of the "little teacher" system. Child welfare stations promote literacy education based on Tao Xingzhi's educational principle of "learn and teach immediately," fostering a spirit of self-help and mutual assistance. As a result, literacy classes of all sizes have been organized in small rooms, attics, and kitchens. Those who serve as teachers are former illiterates from two years ago who, after two years of diligent study at the welfare station, have become teachers. Originally, the "learn and teach immediately" little teacher system had no time limit, but now the child welfare station, in order to ensure mature training, has temporarily set it as a two-year system. The first year is purely literacy education, and the second year is life education. The teaching materials are self-compiled, vivid, practical, and easy to understand. They call it "Easy to Understand for All Ages." In the past two years, more than 200 little teachers have been trained. These little teachers all have exceptionally tragic backgrounds, but their desire for knowledge is extremely strong.</p>
<p>Medical Care and Nutrition: Two Important Tasks</p>
<p>In healthcare, there are two aspects: medical care and nutrition. Each child welfare station has a clinic that provides free medical treatment and medicine to poor children. Every day, more than 200 children are saved. For the sake of universal coverage, there is also a mobile medical team that travels around the slum areas to serve the poor. In terms of nutrition, more than a thousand suffering infants are regularly nourished with milk powder, cod liver oil, and vitamins, all of which come from the Economic Cooperation Administration and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. All beneficiary infants are rigorously investigated by the welfare station, and they cherish resources, never wasting a single bit unless the child truly needs it.</p>
<p>Starting with Eighty San Maos</p>
<p>Mrs. Sun Yat-sen's child welfare work has been underway for less than three years, but through the efforts of just over two years, the results have been significant and the achievements remarkable.</p>
<p>At the beginning, only about 80 San Maos benefited, but now it has expanded to over 20,000 San Maos. However, Mrs. Sun Yat-sen is by no means satisfied with this, as there are too many San Maos in China. And the difficulties follow, because as welfare work expands, the need for funding becomes even more urgent. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are countless homeless children who are waiting for rescue. In order to promote welfare work, it is necessary to mobilize more manpower and resources. It is for this reason that the San Mao Paradise Movement has been announced. Mrs. Sun Yat-sen is determined to build a paradise for San Mao, hoping that one day every San Mao can enter paradise. But this requires the efforts of the public. The child welfare organization is currently preparing to recruit members, seeking members who are willing to help San Mao. According to their estimates, it costs three silver dollars per month to help one San Mao. Anyone who can sponsor one San Mao is an ordinary member, and anyone who can sponsor five or more San Maos is an honorary member. Their goal is to recruit 500 ordinary members before the end of April, which means that 500 San Maos can be saved as a result.</p>
<p>Pitiful Lives of Vagrants</p>
<p>In order to make more people aware of San Mao's impoverished and destitute life, the child welfare station has scheduled a San Mao art exhibition at the Great World Department Store on Children's Day, April 4th. There are more than 300 pictures of San Mao's wandering life on display. I hope you can take the time to visit it once, you will definitely find San Mao lovable. So let us use everyone's strength to build San Mao Paradise!</p>

<h3>Ding ZhiPan Angrily Executes Wan A Da</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Yang WenYu</p>
<p>In the western district of Xuzhou, mentioning Wan A Da, the detective chief of the criminal police team, is quite well-known. His real name is Wan Bin, which is unfamiliar to people. The abnormal social situation has turned him from a coachman into the owner of the Tailai Hotel, a coach company owner, the leader of numerous followers, and the most capable of the five detective chiefs and more than forty detectives in the criminal police team. Who would have known that this "little celebrity" in Suzhou would have his new and old crimes settled so quickly, and that he would be executed at the platform of Suzhou Railway Station at 1:20 AM on the 25th under the wrath of Chairman Ding? Most people were surprised, and even Wan himself did not realize he had committed a capital crime until just before his execution. It was too late to regret. Whether it is "using severe punishments in chaotic times" or "killing one to warn a hundred," Chairman Ding's decisive handling of Wan A Da this time was truly an merciless operation on evil forces.</p>
<p>Served as a Detective for Fourteen Years</p>
<p>Fourteen years ago, Wan A Da began his career as a detective in the investigation team. During the period of occupation, he even served as the captain. He almost lost his life because of a case. After the victory, he was accused of being a traitor under the name of Wan Yunlong. However, due to the social connections he had in all directions, he was not brought down. Of course, people who emerge from such an environment inevitably have many enemies. However, due to his power, no one dared to offend him. Unexpectedly, over a small matter, when Wan was detained by the police patrol team, letters reporting his crimes flew in like snowflakes, finally ending his life. This fact, which borders on karmic retribution, is truly a lesson that should be taken to heart.</p>
<p>The captain of the criminal police team was recently appointed a month ago by Director Wu, who invited Song Yuanheng and Xian Chengming, who had worked in the Zhabei Police Station in Shanghai for a long time, to take over. The reporter had several conversations with them, and they felt that it was difficult to deal with both people and affairs. The small area of Suzhou, the complexity of the people, and the deteriorating social atmosphere were the most troubling.</p>
<p>Wan Arrested in Western Medicine Case</p>
<p>Some time ago, the criminal police team, led by Wan A Da, uncovered a case of counterfeiting Western medicine in Jiuqu Lane. When the group of criminals were detained in the criminal police team, Captain Song ordered that no relatives were allowed to visit. Unexpectedly, Wan A Da privately allowed Kuai Daquan to visit Zhang Liang, the criminal in the case. It happened to be discovered by Deputy Captain Xian, who also found a lump of opium on Kuai. Captain Song, due to his duty, summoned Wan A Da to the office to investigate the responsibility. Who knew that Wan A Da looked down on this new captain and even retorted, almost drawing his gun to fight. Afterwards, Captain Song reported the incident to Director Wu, saying that Wan was so lawless. Thus, Director Wu ordered the police patrol team to detain Wan at the criminal police team. Wan A Da viewed this risk very normally. He believed that he had a way to escape from the cage.</p>
<p>Accusations of Crimes One After Another</p>
<p>However, this opportunity was seized by Wan's many enemies. Therefore, letters reporting his crimes were sent to the county government and the police station one after another. Among them, one case of corruption involved a flour merchant, Chen Ruisheng, who had an affair with Zhang Wang Zhenying, a woman from Weiting. After a long time, Zhang discovered that she was pregnant and demanded money from Chen to have an abortion. The intermediary in this matter was Wan A Da, who took 30,000 yuan of compensation from the 16 old yuan of gold yuan coupons. Some people also said that Wan played the "honey trap" in the case and reaped the price of dozens of bags of flour. In any case, these rumors had long reached Chairman Ding's ears. Therefore, when Chairman Ding came to Suzhou on the 23rd to attend the joint defense conference of the three counties, he was furious about this. On the 24th, after inspecting the river defense from Changshu, he hosted a banquet for people from all walks of life in the Yusha in Ximei Lane, and said to County Magistrate Zhu: "Have Wan Bin shot tomorrow!" At midnight, Chairman Ding and Deputy Commander of the Security Yang Zongding planned to return to the town by special train. However, for some unknown reason, on a whim, he ordered County Magistrate Zhu, who was seeing him off at the station, to immediately bring Wan Bin to the station for execution. Chairman Ding's lightning-fast decision was probably because he was afraid that the all-powerful Wan Bin might escape after he left Suzhou. County Magistrate Zhu obeyed the order and immediately telegraphed Director Wu of the Police Bureau and Commander Sun of the Security Regiment to send soldiers from the search platoon to escort Wan A Da to the station under strict guard. Wan A Da did not expect that his death sentence had been pronounced by Chairman Ding in the Yusha, and even more unexpectedly, he would be on the execution ground in the middle of the night. Along the way, he appeared calm and chatted and laughed with the escorting soldiers.</p>
<p>Screamed for Help Before Execution</p>
<p>When he arrived at the station, Director Wu asked the Chairman how to deal with him. Chairman Ding looked back at Deputy Commander Yang and said, "Just do it!" Yang then wrote eight large characters on the entire file of Wan's case: "By order of the Chairman, executed by shooting." Subsequently, Deputy Commander Yang interrogated Wan on the dark platform. At this time, Wan A Da saw that the situation was so serious and realized that things were not good. In addition, the night was cold and windy, and he could not help but shiver. At that time, Deputy Commander Yang asked Wan Bin's name and age, and then asked him how long he had been a detective. Wan replied that he had been a detective for more than ten years. Wan thought that his ten years of experience could be used to redeem his life, but Deputy Commander Yang's thoughts may have been the opposite. Therefore, he gave the order: "Take him away." Only Wan Bin's desperate screams were heard: "Officer, save me! Officer, save me!" The screams had not yet ended when the gunshots rang out. Wan A Da was quickly shot three times and died beside the water tower on the platform. Deputy Commander Yang finished the execution and ordered that the body be exposed for three days as a warning. Then he boarded the train and reported to Chairman Ding before the special train slowly drove west.</p>
<p>The "hero" created by the times was also swallowed by the times today. Tens of thousands of people flocked to the station to see Wan A Da's last moments!</p>

<h3>National Bank Begins Issuing Fixed Denomination Promissory Notes - To Relieve Cash Panic in the Market - Initially, a 50,000 Yuan Note Will Be Issued, Limited to Circulation in This City</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Silver Money Trust Industry Association of this city, in view of the recent shortage of cash in the market, suggested to the National Bank to issue fixed denomination promissory notes to remedy the situation. It is now learned that the National Bank began to issue the notes yesterday, which are divided into four denominations: 5,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan. Yesterday, the 50,000 yuan note was issued first. This promissory note can be used to replace cash. The phenomenon of cash shortage should be improved as a result.</p>
<p>In addition, according to a confidential official of the National Bank: This promissory note must be countersigned by both the Assistant Manager and the Section Chief of the Operations Bureau before it can be effective. Therefore, due to signature issues, a maximum of 500 to 1,000 notes can be issued per day, which in fact may not be able to completely solve the cash shortage, but can only slightly alleviate the tight cash situation. Therefore, the current issuance is only a transitional measure. In addition, this promissory note is made by the Central Printing Plant with banknote paper, which is about half an inch longer and wider than the current 500 yuan note. There is a wide gray-black border around it, and the middle is a light blue-gray pattern with the six artistic characters "Central Bank Promissory Note" embedded in it. The other side of the promissory note is completely white. Yesterday's issues were all 50,000 yuan denomination promissory notes. However, due to signature issues, they were not actually issued, and the banknotes sent by the Central Printing Plant yesterday were sufficient to be distributed to various banks and businesses.</p>
<h3>Market Sentiment is Volatile, and Gold and Banknotes Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In the gold market, due to the fact that the Central Bank did not throw out gold yesterday, and even the emergence of large-denomination promissory notes, market sentiment was volatile.

After a slight drop to 743,000, it soon rose to the daily limit of 748,000. In the afternoon, due to the further contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate, gold prices in other areas rose one after another. Market sentiment continued to be optimistic, and the opening price reached 780,000. Midway, due to the sudden tightening of credit, the unofficial interest rate rose to eight or nine jiao, and the securities gang sold high, stepping down slightly to 750,000.

<h3>Credit Market Turns from Loose to Stable</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday's credit market was still loose in the morning, but gradually stabilized in the afternoon. Although tightening was seen during the exchange, the daily borrowing rate in the morning was still between 35 yuan and 45 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the large-scale sale of foreign exchange transfer certificates by the National Bank, credit tightened, and the unofficial interest rate rose to 70 yuan to 80 yuan per day. Also, yesterday, banks and bureaus had a total deficit of 5.1 billion, foreign merchant banks had a surplus of 1.3 billion, large exchanges had a surplus of 4.4 billion, and small exchanges had a deficit of 600 million.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks are All Red - Still Buying More After the Daily Limit</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The market situation of Chinese stocks yesterday was extremely sharp, which was an unprecedented grand occasion after the resumption of trading on the exchange. In the early morning, the trend of credit was even more rampant than on Saturday, and the gold price was reported to have stopped after opening. Since the resumption of aftermarket trading yesterday made trading more flexible and reduced the risks for both long and short positions, market sentiment was therefore invigorated. Yongsha opened at 9.54 yuan in the morning and immediately reported a limit increase. Many bulls sold their profits from Saturday, and it fell to 8.73 yuan. Afterwards, various parties absorbed again at low prices, and the market trend reached the daily limit again. Over-the-counter buying was especially strong. After reaching the limit, there was demand for additional bids of 0.3, 0.35, and even 0.45.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks all reached their daily limits. Among them, Meiya had a particularly strong trend, opening at 2.78 yuan in the morning and reaching the limit. Xinguang was at 0.96 yuan, Jingfu was at 0.4 yuan, Jinglun was at 2.4 yuan, Qinxing was at 0.53 yuan, Huaci was at 2.9 yuan, Yonggong was at 2.28 yuan, Xinhua Department Store was at 2.94 yuan, Commerce was at 2.82 yuan, and Zhabei Water and Electricity was at 1.8 yuan. After the limit, there was still buying for additional bids over-the-counter.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yongsha was initially opened at the previous day's limit due to the obstruction of the limit increase transaction in the previous market, and there was demand for additional bids of 0.2 and 0.25. The highest additional bid was 0.5 and 0.55. In the middle, it was heard that the price of gold had fallen and credit felt tight. The unofficial interest rate on securities was made to 0.7 and 0.75. After breaking the limit, it was still reported to be at the limit increase. It was not until 2:45 that the selling trend turned strong and it broke the limit again to 9.2 yuan. Near the close, the securities gang worked hard and reported the limit increase again. Other stocks such as Xinguang rose from 0.94 yuan to the daily limit of 0.96 yuan. The total turnover for the day was 3,192,403,360 shares.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise with No Goods</h3>
<p>Due to the rise in gold prices, people were optimistic about gold public bonds. The morning opening was 400,000 for buying, and then there was a transaction at 430,000. The afternoon closing was 500,000, and the asking price was still 500,000 in the afternoon, but there was no transaction.</p>

Yisha was at 27,000 yuan and 27,500 yuan, British Union was at 30,000 yuan and 33,000 yuan, Asia was at 3,000 yuan and 3,200 yuan, Jardine was bidding at 85,000 for buying, and other stocks were also in demand.</p>
<h3>Silk Price Surge Followed by Market Softening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market surged sharply. After the market opened, speculative trading was rampant, gold prices soared, and cotton yarn prices skyrocketed, boosting market sentiment.</p>
<p>The "120" Bright Silk grade opened at 3,010,000, rose as high as 3,460,000, and closed at noon at 3,900,000 for the forward position. In the afternoon, monetary conditions tightened, gold prices retreated, and the excessive price increases led many long positions to cash in, causing the market to soften. The quoted price for the forward position was 3,800,000.</p>
<p>Raw silk opened in the morning at 4,800,000. Subsequently, rising gold prices and strengthening foreign exchange rates improved market sentiment, leading to aggressive buying and steadily rising prices, nearing 5,050,000 near noon. In the afternoon, the market softened and the intent to sell was strong, with supply available at 5,000,000. Quilted silk fabrics opened at 2,150,000, rose to 2,250,000 at one point, then experienced profit-taking and increased selling pressure, causing the market to decline to 2,110,000. At noon, buying interest surged again, leading to a rebound and a close at 2,270,000. Market sentiment softened significantly in the afternoon, and with tightening monetary conditions, selling was quoted at 2,200,000.</p>
<h3>Rayon Price List</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the China Trust Bureau's Rayon Meeting resolved the rayon price list for the 14th period of this year (March 28 to April 2). The prices are: Italian 120 Third Grade Bright Rayon at 2,950,000 yuan per case. 120 Dull Rayon at 3,215,500 yuan per case. 150 Third Grade Bright Rayon at 2,773,000 yuan per case.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Soar; Fabric Buying Spree Begins</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions, with favorable monetary conditions and external factors, boosted buying sentiment. People rushed to purchase, and local businesses eagerly sought fine yarn. Businesses from Guangdong also showed interest. Cotton yarn prices soared sharply, with an average increase of about 30%.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix yarn dropped from 5,400,000 to a low of 5,300,000, then rebounded to 5,780,000 at noon, a staggering increase of 1,250,000 compared to the Wealth Weekend closing price. 32-count Silver Moon yarn neared the 4,000,000 mark, closing at 3,900,000, a sharp increase of 780,000.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods opened in the morning at 2,830,000, briefly dipped to 2,800,000, and then broke through the 3,000,000 mark to reach a peak of 3,050,000 at the close, a surge of 615,000 yuan. Factory orders closed at 3,000,000 at noon. 20-count Double Horse surged by 600,000 yuan, closing at 2,870,000. Jin Cheng and Tian Nu yarns also traded around 2,800,000 yuan. All grades of 16-count and below reached unprecedented highs. The market is closed today for the holiday.</p>
<p>The fabric market soared, mainly due to increasingly abundant monetary conditions. Many in the industry held long positions, and there were few takers for overnight loans. Additionally, reports from outside the industry indicated rising prices, prompting widespread buying. Sellers were reluctant to sell, and fabric prices reached new highs.</p>
<p>Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened at 96,000 yuan, briefly dipping to 95,000 yuan. Near noon, rumors of soaring cotton yarn prices prompted aggressive buying from industry players, causing prices to steadily increase and break through the 100,000 mark, reaching a new peak of 112,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 24,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Wu Fu and La Ba Tong Fine Cloth both closed at 92,500 yuan, an increase of 11,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Si Jun Zi Serge rose from 92,000 yuan to a high of 97,500 yuan, closing at 97,200 yuan at noon, a final increase of 14,200 yuan. Si Jun Zi Yuan Zhi Tribute Cloth held steady at 100,000 yuan. The high-end 190 grade of Shi Lin brand opened at 220,000 yuan. Today is National Renaissance Day, and the fabric market is closed for the holiday. Trading will resume as usual tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Sale of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to entrust the Textile Construction Company to sell yarn, conducting two rounds of sales. A total of 386 lots were sold to 215 eligible buyers, with a total value of 1,029,480,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The sale process was as follows: (1) 115 lots of 20-count Red Bee yarn were offered at 2,480,000 yuan, with 6 applicants for 25 lots, which were allocated accordingly. (2) 361 lots of 20-count Li Ma Sunlight yarn were offered at 2,680,000 yuan, with 209 applicants for 1,066 lots, and 361 lots were allocated to 209 eligible buyers.</p>

<h3>Coal Prices Adjusted Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Four Mines Joint Management Office adjusted coal prices again yesterday. The new prices are as follows for delivery in Pudong: Chang Cheng White Coal Lump at 250,000 yuan per ton, White Coal Small at 200,000 yuan, Jilong Bituminous Coal at 150,500 yuan, Kailuan Bituminous Coal at 182,620 yuan, and Foreign Bituminous Coal at 381,240 yuan.</p>
<h3>Diesel Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The tanker "Dank Mershm" (transliteration), managed by the Mei Bang Company, carrying 3,800 tons of diesel from Persia, is expected to arrive today and berth at the China Petroleum Company pier in Laoshusha for unloading. The vessel also carries 10,500 tons of diesel destined for Kaohsiung.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Rises</h3>
<p>Although the tung oil market experienced weak sales yesterday due to limited actual demand, the unprecedented abundance of monetary conditions in the industry and the sudden sharp increases in the prices of other commodities, especially the surge in foreign exchange settlement certificates, boosted market sentiment. Sellers continued to raise prices, climbing more than 10,000 yuan compared to last week. The underlying support remained solid, suggesting a continued upward trend.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Continues to Wire Government Ministries, Urging Removal of Restrictions on Southward Transport of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce imposed restrictions on the southward transport of yarn and cloth, the resulting stagnant sales of cotton cloth have directly threatened the suspension of production in the textile and dyeing industries, a matter of great concern. Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce again telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, urging them to immediately abolish the quota system for southward transport.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market opened strongly in the south, reaching new price peaks. This was attributed to widespread rumors that tea-producing regions such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui were planning to value this year's unreleased new tea in terms of white rice, with most requiring eight or more "shi" (unit of volume) of white rice to exchange for one hundred "jin" (unit of weight) of new tea. This greatly boosted market sentiment. Furthermore, rising gold and US dollar prices led to increases in the prices of various commodities, and tea merchants followed suit, with sellers quoting prices at will, leading to further rapid price increases.</p>
<p>Although there were attempts to raise the price of this year's Wenzhou Xin Longjing tea, they ultimately lacked the strength to push higher, as the source prices remained unchanged. It was reported that industry players were still discounting prices at 8,000 yuan per "jin." However, the underlying support remained firm. It was observed that trading activity today was limited, with buyers wary of high prices and few wholesale transactions.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>— By a Spectator</p>
<p>Rising Winds Expand Rapidly; Promissory Notes Add Fuel to the Fire</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rising trend spread widely, and the price increases exceeded general expectations.</p>
<p>Today is a holiday, which actually provides an opportunity. In recent weeks, the market has often fluctuated during holidays. Given the current macroeconomic environment, creating new data could give everyone a "good show."</p>
<p>Prices are bound to equalize, which is why economics has the concept of "price level."</p>
<p>The continuous rise in rice and coal prices while general prices remained stagnant led us to conclude that a comprehensive price surge was imminent. However, yesterday's price surge was so strong that the issuance of large-denomination promissory notes by the Central Bank had a significant stimulating effect.</p>
<p>The four denominations of 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 yuan promissory notes are undoubtedly equivalent to disguised large-denomination Gold Yuan certificates of 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Central Bank stated that the reason for issuing large-denomination promissory notes was to alleviate the cash shortage.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the shortage of cash, promissory notes and checks have been subject to substantial discounts. The market needs cash, but the Central Bank issues promissory notes, which is like giving stones to starving people who need food.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was said that a 10,000-yuan promissory note or check could only be exchanged for 8,000 yuan in cash.</p>
<p>Instead of finding ways to increase the supply of cash, the Central Bank increased the supply of promissory notes. With the supply of promissory notes exceeding demand, the discount will only increase.</p>
<p>Isn't this equivalent to adding fuel to the fire?</p>
<p>If one believes that Central Bank promissory notes will not be discounted, I truly do not know why they would "not."</p>
<p>If one argues that Central Bank promissory notes can be readily exchanged for cash, and therefore will not be discounted, then why doesn't the Central Bank simply issue cash? Why take the extra step of issuing promissory notes?</p>
<p>The reason for issuing promissory notes instead of cash is that promissory notes are less convenient than cash, because they need to be processed through a bank. Converting them to cash takes time, and with interest rates so high, a discount is inevitable.</p>
<p>Paying Salaries with Promissory Notes Aggravates Small Clerks</p>
<p>It's the end of the month, the time for paying wages and salaries, and the need for cash is extremely urgent. The Central Bank is not supplying cash, but instead supplying promissory notes. As a result, most people will receive wages and salaries in the form of promissory notes this month.</p>

<h3>Departing Foreign Soldiers Issue Challenge; Sino-American Clash Tonight</h3>
<p>The two U.S. Navy teams, Pfeiffer and McLain, will transfer and leave Shanghai tomorrow. To mark their farewell, they have joined forces with elite players from Nacas to form the U.S. All-Stars team, challenging the Chinese league champion, Hua Lian. The match is scheduled for 7:30 PM tonight at the Municipal Gymnasium. Before the main event, there will be a curtain-raiser match between the Basketball Committee and You Yi team. To avoid overcrowding, ticket prices have been adjusted slightly. Upstairs seating remains at 500 yuan, while downstairs seating is 1,500 yuan, and courtside seating is 1,000 yuan. Reserved seating will be available for pre-sale starting at 10:00 AM, and the other two types of tickets will go on sale starting at 1:00 PM. The gymnasium doors will open at 5:00 PM. The Si Wei Boy Scouts will be on hand to maintain order. The three original league games scheduled for today have been postponed.</p>
<p>The Basketball Committee consists of many veterans of the basketball scene, such as Chairman Qian Xuchang, Captain Zhou Jun, and Wu Zibin, Chen Yong'an, and Chen Weiyuan. Xie Yiqin and Lin Zuoshi are also formidable players. Their strength should not be underestimated. You Yi has had mediocre results since joining the Class B league, but enjoys strong fan support. Their players Su Shifeng, Wang Xuewu, Wei Yuping, Zhang Fa, and Jin Yan are all skilled. A fierce battle is inevitable when they face the veterans of the Basketball Committee.</p>
<p>Hua Lian has won the league championship for the past three consecutive years and is poised to win this year's title as well. They are virtually unchallenged in Shanghai. Under the leadership of Li Zhenzhong and Ren Xiangcheng, the veterans and newcomers such as Adi and Xiao Leizi have a good understanding and are skilled and technically proficient. The U.S. All-Stars team is a formidable opponent, and Hua Lian will have to go all out to maintain their reputation.</p>
<p>The U.S. All-Stars team combines the best players from McLain, Pfeiffer, and Nacas, including the tall player Lis, the African-American player Brown, and Botou, Ikater, Keller, and others, all of whom are energetic and skilled. Chely Bretto is intelligent and knowledgeable about Hua Lian's strategy, making him a formidable opponent. In short, the departing foreign soldiers are launching an all-out assault, hoping to defeat the champion. It is clear that they come with ill intentions. The clash between the Chinese and Western powerhouses will be exciting and intense, creating an unprecedented spectacle.</p>
<h3>Today's Basketball League Games All Postponed</h3>
<p>The Basketball League originally had three Class A games scheduled for today, but both Nacas and Chong De requested postponements. Additionally, due to the U.S. All-Stars' challenge to Hua Lian, it has been decided to postpone all games. The Class A Hua Lian vs. Shanghai Police game on the 31st has also been postponed. The organizers have rescheduled the games as follows:</p>

<h3>Democracy Cup Kicks Off Today; Railway Disguises Itself as Zhong Yi</h3>
<p>To commemorate Youth Day, the Municipal Stadium will hold the opening match of the Democracy Cup Senior Group Football Tournament, Samsung vs. Zhong Lin, at 4:00 PM today in the South City Stadium. Samsung is actually the Railway team, which won the Mayor's Cup the other day, with the exact same lineup, without a single change. The only difference is the organizer of the team. Therefore, it can be said that it is one team with two names. Although Zhong Yi is an unfamiliar team, the players are actually familiar faces. Judging from their lineup, it is clear that it is just old wine in new bottles. Samsung is known for its bold and fast-paced play, while Zhong Yi also adopts a straightforward style, with few fancy moves. The match between the two teams will be a good test of their abilities. Zi Wen and Lu Qingxiang, who played for Xin Xian Lin in the South City League, were unable to show their full potential. Their return to the team this time is self-explanatory. The referee is Wang Lin, and the linesmen are Ni Shiyao and Fang Rongfu. Admission is 700 yuan. The team lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Samsung</p>
<p>Liao Xiong</p>
<p>Yue Renxiao Wu Jiabang</p>
<p>Lu Bingsheng Gao Baozheng Cao Liming</p>
<p>Wu Binghao Xiao Ziwen Zhang Jie Lu Qingxiang Lin Dianyi</p>

<p>Xian Boming Sun Hanxing Zhou Bingrong</p>

<p>Yu Musen Ruan Longsheng Chen Longquan Yao Jihua Lu Fangkui</p>
<h3>Ren Yu Defeats Pfeiffer; Hui Li Loses to McLain</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday evening, the two Class A basketball league games were: (1) McLain defeated Hui Li, 63 to 42, with the first half score being 24 to 22. (2) Ren Yu defeated Pfeiffer, 51 to 43, with the first half tied at 28. The second game was more intense. Ren Yu scored twelve consecutive points in the final four minutes to secure the victory. The 2,000-plus spectators were ecstatic, and their cheers reverberated outside.</p>
<p>McLain is a fast-breaking team. In the first half, Hui Li held their positions and managed to cope. In the second half, Hui Li's stamina waned, and they replaced several young players, who could only assist but not fully contribute. As a result, under McLain's relentless attack, Hui Li gradually fell behind. After 37 to 30, the situation became irreversible. Although Hui Li called six timeouts, it was to no avail.</p>

<p>In the second game, Ren Yu faced Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer scored the first five points, and Ren Yu called a timeout. Xu Zhongyi and Shen Pengju then scored with consecutive throws and fouls, surpassing Pfeiffer with a score of 6 to 5. From then on, the game was balanced, with each team showing their skills. Xu Shenxinyun repeatedly penetrated the defense, and Keller also made frequent contributions. The score was tied three times at 18, 22, and 26, until the end of the first half, with each team scoring 28 points, evenly matched.</p>
<p>In the second half, Pengju scored first, but Galach Brownet scored continuously, making the score 39 to 33. Li Sun Xu quickly chased, making the situation extremely tense. In the last four minutes, the score was 39 to 43. Ren Yu gritted their teeth, and Zhongyi, Pengju, Guozheng, and Xinyun scored twelve consecutive points.

<h3>Xiangdao Ball News (Hong Kong Soccer Report)</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Airlines News] Last weekend's First Division Football League had a total of six matches.

<p>Bus Wins Over China by Two Goals</p>
<p>It was drizzling on Saturday, but the games went on as scheduled. The match between China and Bus deserves special mention because it was related to the runner-up position. On this day, both teams made changes to their left wings. During the match, Bus dominated the midfield. Although China's forwards were dangerous when pressing the goal, their center-backs were too busy covering, and completely failed to send any power forward. In addition, China's two inside forwards didn't come back to help much, so Bus often broke the formation into two segments. If it weren't for goalkeeper Yu Qi'en's outstanding performance, Bus would have lost by more than two goals.</p>

<p>South South Easily Takes Down Tai-ke</p>
<p>The battle between South China South and Hong Kong Club, although a rainy match, did not affect the ball control ability of both sides. Only the wet and heavy ball slipping was difficult for the two goalkeepers. Nan Nan's own goal was proof of that, but it cannot be entirely blamed on Yu Yaode's fumble, but rather his foot hooked the ball into the goal by mistake. As for the three goals that Tai-ke lost, they were not unjustified. Looking at the advantage of Nan Nan yesterday, if it were not for Fo-ye and Hei-zai who were cautious due to new injuries and did not dare to bravely charge, losing many scoring opportunities, and the "Da Pu Ting's" penalty kick feast, Tai-ke would have lost at least six goals. It is not an exaggeration to say that.</p>
<p>However, "the final verdict is made," although Tai-ke lost, they did not play too badly. The initial vigorous offensive created by Chia-neng and Wu-lun's linking, was dangerous enough; but the undeniable mistake was that Bickford, who was usually on the left wing, was transferred to the defense, trying to contain He Yingfen's progress, but it was inevitable that he was using talent improperly and counterproductively. All three goals won by Nan Nan came from opportunities found on the left. Jing is the main reason for Tai-ke's defeat in this match.</p>
<p>However, the long-winning army's unbeaten record is also entirely the deserved result of technical skills. The offense, defense, advance, and retreat all had wonderful performances. Although Hou Yusheng was in the bad conditions of rainy and slippery ground, he still had bold and neat style of play, and Xie Jinhong's sitting in the center-back, with a majestic and heroic demeanor, are really endearing. Liu Songsheng and Zhang Jinhai's performances are "gradually returning to their old form" compared to the "Governor's Cup" match. Fo-ye and Hei-zai's comeback made the fans see their wonderful passing and elusive feints again, which is truly pleasing to the eye. Second Uncle leads the three armies, directing the charge, not letting the teenagers. Fei Chunhua's reluctant acceptance of the right wing, and Zhu Jincheng's using "B" material as "A" material, is also barely satisfactory. But strictly speaking, Nan Nan's forwards still cannot get rid of the slow-moving problem. I hope that they can "bravely" improve in the future, so that they will not "fall short of success"! The lineups of both sides in this match are as follows:</p>

<p>Chicks and Proud Soldiers Tie With Kwong Wah</p>
<p>The battle between South China's fledgling team and Kwong Wah, judging from the usual performances of the two teams, South China should have won the two points in this match. However, after seventy minutes of lackluster and dull game, Kwong Wah was able to tie the chicks 3-3, which is truly a "miracle"!</p>
<p>Looking at the complete lack of fighting spirit and cooperation of Kwong Wah's generals in the first half, especially when Guo Wentian was injured and left the field, and they were fighting with ten men, the "playing" was really like catkins沾泥, and they simply gave the chicks control of the entire scene, taking whatever they wanted. In less than fifteen minutes, South China won three goals, which shows how disorganized Kwong Wah was at that time.</p>
<p>However, as the game continued, the generals of South China gradually "recovered" their "arrogant" state, but they did not know that this was the loophole that caused them to win. On the contrary, after Guo Wentian returned to the battle, the morale of the entire Kwong Wah army was high, and they fought more and more bravely, and finally recovered the lost ground one after another. What this game gave the audience was not any wonderful and exciting process, but only a repetition of the historical lesson that "an arrogant army will be defeated."</p>

<h3>Usury in Rural Areas of Jiangnan</h3>
<p>— Qi Nian</p>
<p>Years of war, although Jiangnan has not directly suffered the disaster of artillery fire, the rural economy has become increasingly collapsed. Farmers work hard all year round, and the price of rice and grain they get is already astounding, but the rate of increase is still far less than that of other goods. In terms of customs, they are becoming increasingly extravagant, and consumption expenses are naturally increasing invisibly. What's more, the main land tax is increasing year by year; the burden of military service is even more urgent than fire. Therefore, in today's Jiangnan farmers, those who are not heavily indebted are probably one in ten.</p>
<p>In the past, pawnshops were institutions for regulating the economy of the poor, but today, due to the changes of the times, they have disappeared. Therefore, if there is a shortage of funds, the only way out is to borrow money. Since there are loans, there is interest. In a situation where there are many borrowers and few lenders, a variety of usury has been brewed in the current rural areas.</p>
<p>Two years ago, borrowing in the countryside, with a monthly interest rate of three cents, was considered high interest. Because the authorities once issued a strict ban, both borrowers and lenders were afraid of the order, and the flow of money was carried out secretly. However, not long after, the currency value dropped sharply, and even if the lenders took heavy interest, it was not enough to compensate for the loss of depreciation. Therefore, no one with money was willing to lend it. With a change of mind, they changed to lending physical objects as the main thing. In this way, they could both protect their principal and get their interest, which is a double benefit. Up to now, borrowers quench their thirst with poison, and lenders get more and more, and the interest rates have increased.</p>
<p>The most common is the "half grain head," which means that if you borrow one grain of rice, you have to pay back one and a half grains of rice after the rice is harvested. Among today's usury, it is still considered the lightest. In addition, there are similar names such as "six grains," "seven grains," etc. In other words, if you borrow one stone of rice, the interest must be increased to six or seven dou, depending on the supply and demand relationship at the time of borrowing.</p>
<p>The above kind generally has a time of one full year. As for short-term ones, there is a kind called "monthly payment," which is the most exploitative. For example, if you borrow one stone of rice, the term can be determined according to the needs of the borrower, but you must pay one dou of interest every month. In addition, during the New Year, gambling is very popular in rural areas, and betting with rice is a common occurrence. Gamblers often want to make a comeback, and even if they seek loans, they do not hesitate to make a desperate bet. The interest rate on such loans is even more alarming, called "lottery money," which is generally calculated on a daily basis, and the interest of each stone has to be as much as a dou of rice, which can be said to be frightening.</p>
<p>The shrewd moneylenders also have so-called "wheat buns." The meaning is that although the wheat of the villagers is still in the seedling stage, they have already sold it to the price master. However, its price is often half the market price. This profit from lowering the price is indirectly the interest. The same kind of nature is still available to put "rice buns", its meaning is also the same, but to wheat instead of rice only. The time for borrowing is mostly after the Lunar New Year for the former, and around the time when wheat is on the market for the latter. In a short period of three to several months, the principal and interest must be paid. For the sake of urgency, the rural farmers drink salt brine, and they can't care about so many. It is said that ruthless lenders take advantage of the repeated lending of "wheat buns" and "rice buns," and the profits are so great that the physical objects are actually several times their principal in a year.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation has been turbulent, and people with money seem to be deeply wary of lending money. Recently, there has been crying and sobbing in the tea shops, and the poor people are almost suffering from the pain of not being able to borrow money. In this situation, even the most harsh usury has to be endured with tears.</p>
<h3>What I Saw in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Xu Dasan</p>
<p>On vacation back home, met with the conscription frenzy. On the Lantern Festival, the county magistrate personally went to the countryside to supervise the conscription, convened a meeting of rural保長, prohibited public attendance, and had strict security. As the news spread, everyone talked about "soldiers" with fear. On this night, several eligible young men in the village hired a small boat together, temporarily acting as water residents, and took turns guarding, waiting for news. If there was any news, they would gently row to another river to avoid the wind. After a night of returning, everyone silently rejoiced that nothing happened.</p>
<p>The story of Shi Hao Li is recognized as the masterpiece of anti-war literature. If I had talent, then today's situation would not be inferior to Shi Hao Li. The records of military service in the past dynasties can be described as extremely cruel. At the end of the Tang Dynasty, the藩鎭 rebelled. Flames of war everywhere. When Liang Tai-feng was in藩鎭, the law was particularly strict. If the generals were killed in battle, all the soldiers under his command were beheaded, which was called "拔隊斬". Most of the soldiers who lost their main generals fled and dared not return. Tai-zu ordered that all soldiers be tattooed on their faces to record the military number. If the soldiers or villagers escaped, Guanze would arrest them and send them to their subordinates, and none would die. The villagers also dared not tolerate them, so the escapees gathered in the mountains and lakes and became bandits, which was a great problem for the prefectures and counties.</p>
<p>The Biography of Liu Shouguang in the Old History of the Five Dynasties also has similar records: Liu Rengong exhausted all the men in his department, over the age of fifteen and under the age of seventy, and tattooed their faces, writing "定覇都". Scholars tattooed their arms, writing "一心事主". A total of 200,000 people were obtained. Even the literati were not spared in addition to the soldiers. The tragic events in troubled times are really frightening. Some time ago, it was reported that the commander of a garrison in a certain place, in order to prevent prisoners from escaping, ordered the prisoners to leave a tuft of hair on their heads when they shaved their heads to show identification. Leaving hair instead of tattooing their faces, compared to the past, this garrison commander can be said to be much more civilized.</p>
<h3>Quiet News of Lockups</h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>The mountainous area of Hawaii Island is the place with the most rainfall in the world, reaching more than 400 inches per year. The opposite of it is Honolulu, where there are only dozens of days a year without sunlight.</p>
<p>On July 8, 1776, the "Liberty Bell" used by the United States to declare independence is now in Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The bell weighs 2080 pounds, is three inches thick, and has a circumference of twelve feet.</p>
<p>There is also a large bronze bell in Seoul, Korea, which is ten feet high and was cast in 1468. It is said that when it was cast, an infant was thrown into the copper solution, so when it is struck, its sound is like an infant calling its mother.</p>
<p>In the fifth century AD, there was a Greek spy named Sischakas, who cut open the scalp of a slave and stuffed secret documents into his scalp. After his hair grew out, he took him across the enemy's area.</p>
<h3>Sincerity is "〇"</h3>
<p>— Guan Jin</p>
<p>The ancients said: Sincerity is effective;</p>
<p>Modern people say: Sincerity is "〇".</p>
<p>The people sincerely supported the gold yuan bills, took out their savings of many years, dozens of "big heads," and exchanged them for brand-new gold yuan bills of one hundred and dozens of yuan at a price of one to two; what is the value now? Equal to "〇".</p>
<p>Sincerely "streamlining the army," sincerely "reducing the burden on the old surname," sincerely this, sincerely that; isn't the result still one red "〇" after another on the budget?</p>
<p>Sincerely "stopping the printing of gold yuan bills," sincerely "selling gold and silver materials" to stabilize prices, sincerely this, sincerely that, as a result, there is an extra "〇" on the gold yuan bills, an extra "〇" on the prices, or the index is the most ineffective, as if there is a "〇" missing.</p>
<p>The slogan of the 20th century is: Sincerity is effective;</p>
<p>The reality of the 20th century is: Sincerity is 〇.</p>
<h3>Rambling Examination of Kites</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, I have often seen children flying kites with great joy. I lingered and lingered, and couldn't leave; I felt that my childlike innocence could be found, and I was more comforted. Returning home and flipping through miscellaneous books, I wrote "Rambling Examination of Kites".</p>
<p>Paper recommendations are commonly known as pigeons, and they have existed since the Qi and Liang Dynasties. Ming Chen Meigong's Bai Shiqiao Zhen manuscript "Distinguishing Kites" says: "During the time of Qi Wenxuan Gao Yang,... Zhu Zhu Yuan,... Pengcheng Wang Xie's grandson, Shao, was imprisoned in a dungeon. His cousin Huang Tou'er ordered him and the prisoners to fly each with a paper kite from the Jin Feng Building. Huang Tou alone was able to fly to Zimo before falling...." The Miscellaneous Records say: "Hou Jing besieged the Taicheng (Liang). Jianwen made paper recommendations to fly in the air and asked for help from the outside..." The use of kites is not just for games, one is for executing people, and one is for asking for help. Later, Tang Gao Pian once wrote a kite poem, with the phrase "The sound of strings is heard in the quiet night in the blue sky, and the palace sound trusts the wind back and forth." "Xunchu Lu" says: "Li Ye of the Five Dynasties made paper kites in the palace, pulling the thread and riding the wind for play; later, he used bamboo as a flute on the head of the kite, so that the wind entered the bamboo, and the sound was like a zither, so it was named a kite." However, now the kites without bamboo flutes on their heads are also called kites.</p>
<p>There are also people in later generations who wrote kite poems to entrust satire, such as Song Zhuang Jiyu's "Chicken Rib Chapter" which records that Lu Huiqing ordered a Taoist to write a poem with the theme of kites, and the Taoist responded and wrote: "Because of the wind, they are stimulated in the clouds, and the noisy children look up; don't let the silk be too much and let it fly high, but also prevent the wind from being tight and it is difficult to collect." The meaning outside the string can be known. A Ming person named Shui An also has a poem that says: "I am full of watching the hurricane go away, and my feelings are like paper. I am strong and fight with it to the end. Don't let the scenery all be used up, and the spring breeze will also have a time to end." Infinite emotion, can really be used as a warning song.</p>
<p>The ancients said: After Qingming, the wind is soft and weak, and this game is no longer played. Our Changshu nursery rhyme also says: "Kites are flown on Qingming, turtles are flown." Although the language is vulgar, it also implies the meaning of not being extremely happy.</p>
<h3>Longkou Town and Ji Shuo Read Jinggong's Poems Together</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhao</p>
<p>The guest comes again before a year has passed, the host meets each other a thousand times a day, the dense shade of the big tree by the window merges, and the dawn of the mountains across the house opens. This place should return to Chen Riyue, who knew the Han building before? I can tell you about the exclusive gully of Dinglin, no wonder the magpies of Jiang cry today.</p>
<h3>Taking Jinggong's Sentence as the Beginning and End</h3>
<p>— Chen Ji Shuo</p>
<p>Two mountains push the door to send green, the sea is vast, and the crane returns again. It is known that the destiny of the sky is determined by the fate of the sky, and the cup is happy to open to the uncle. There is no need to find the dream of the locust country, but to do the work of wearing a fur coat at the Yanzi platform. You can share the pleasure of Quyang and Miyang. The article still taboos many sorrows.</p>
