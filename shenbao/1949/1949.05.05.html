<h3>欲防止太平洋悲慘局面發生　唯有加緊軍事經濟援華　陳納德在美參院軍委會大聲疾呼</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓三日電〕陳納德少將三日預料共產黨若不在中國被遏制，則日本與菲律濱均將赤化。</p>
<p>陳納德係向參院軍事委員會發表證詞，對於亞洲海岸所謂「島嶼陣綫」之防禦價值，加以嗤笑，並預料蘇聯將有從貝林海峽直至峇厘之大東亞共榮圈。陳氏然後問曰，「在此等情况下，珍珠港，中途島，關島，威克島，紐西蘭，澳大利亞，菲律濱以及太平洋中較小各島嶼之情勢將如何？我人若認為能從太平洋之此方面防衛太平洋，簡直蠢愚。」</p>
<p>共和黨參議員諾籣旋在參院發言，請全體參議員誦讀陳納德之證詞。</p>
<p>陳納德復稱，防止悲慘局面發生之唯一途徑，厥為在軍事及經濟上援助中國。陳氏繼即叙述亞洲東南部之防衛力量為如何脆弱，然後稱，數日前奎松夫人及伊女兒在距馬尼刺不足百哩處被殘殺，足證共產黨頒導之農民軍在菲律濱作亂，性質仍嚴重。</p>
<p>美國應迅速行動</p>
<p>陳氏續稱，除非美國迅速行動，否則中國共產黨將抵越南邊陲，該處已有莫斯科訓練之胡志明樹立其共黨政權，預料胡志明得中國方面之援助，其權力將擴展至越南其餘部份，其後，暹羅將兩面被圍，該國之陷落，將使馬來之門戶洞開，然後緬甸與印度尼西亞羣島亦將相繼淪亡。共產黨佔領東南亞將以嚴重壓力加諸印度，並鼓勵蘇聯重新向緊急之中東前進。若認為整個亞洲在共黨掌握中，日本與菲律賓仍將和平留於美國方面，實屬樂觀之夢話，除非美國採行「殘忍之帝國主義」政策而使日本成為殖民地，否則日人將成共產黨維治下亞洲之附庸而無他途可循。「是以余預料我人現正採取的輕易道路之尾端，將有「共產主義之日本。」</p>
<p>陳氏建議美國給予援助，隨以美方之監督稱，「瓊斯君之慣例為渠撥出巨額政府貸款時，即派人隨款同行，俾確知款項如何化用。」中國人對此並不起反感，如魏德邁中將領導下所獲「重大進展」，即其例證。「如果魏德邁能在承平時代繼續其在戰爭中開始之優良工作，余確信我人如今當無問題無疑。」</p>
<p>陳納德在國會對外援助聯席委員會及參院軍事委員會分別為中國呼籲，並述及渠對中國在感情上之連繫，包括其中國夫人在內，陳氏發表證詞時，其夫人始終列席旁聽。陳氏表示願出售其在中國經營之航空綫，並以一己力量供獻於美國援華程序。陳氏出席參院軍事委員會後復向新聞界談稱，預料中共或許可以在長沙與衡陽被阻，此兩地為進入中國內地及南部之要道。</p>
<p>每日約須百萬元</p>
<p>據參院軍事委負會主席泰亭斯告新聞界稱，陳納德估計保持工作「每日約須一百萬元」。或問此項耗費須持續多久，泰氏答稱，此事牽涉「如何能有所為力之任何可能的計劃」，故渠不能置評。</p>
<p>陳納德又告新聞記者稱，渠信白崇禧將軍將從漢口退至長沙，長沙與衡陽兩地均易防守。陳氏對於蔣總裁將否接掌防守華南之積極領導權一問題，避不作正面答覆，僅稱，「余信彼等業已擬定保衛該區之計劃，余認為彼等不致浪費生命以圖扼守漢口。」陳氏復云。共產黨欲往華南，僅有兩條可能的路徑，其一係海路，另一係陸路，從杭州與漢口兩區，沿鐵道與公路綫而進往長沙·衡陽。共軍不致沿海路行動，沿陸路行動，則國軍若堅强保衛長沙·共軍即不可能越過長沙。因此美國必須予以援助，使能扼守該地。或問如果大陸淪陷，為何台灣難守，陳氏答曰，「不能從該地出發攻擊。」又云，渠最近未與麥帥談話，惟其意見係以麥帥之見解為根據，蓋共軍進佔瀋陽時，麥帥曾向華盛頓要求派軍四個師以增强日本防禦力量。麥帥此種要求表示麥帥相信共軍在北方得利，結果已使日本受側面威脅。遠東全境共產主義之「反響連鎖」，產生重大威脅。</p>
<p>對抗共黨之核心</p>
<p>陳氏指出中國五個省份及回教勢力强力之西北為對抗共產主義之潛在核心，稱「我人若决定因國家安全計，必須在亞洲採取具體行動之政策，旨在遏阻與抑止亞洲之共產黨，則除美國納稅人之金元外，尚有其他許多力量可藉以作戰及工作。中國廣東·湖南·廣西·雲南·四川及同教西北等區，地方自治之傳統力量向來堅强，其領袖具有抵抗被征服之决心。</p>
<p>美參議員諾倫特要求魏德邁作證</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓四日電〕力圖在軍火援助歐洲計劃中加入對國民黨中國政府的軍事援助的若干條款的運動，四日已見端倪，共和黨參議員諾倫特稱，當軍火法案提出國會時，渠將提出上項修正。按軍事援助法案將在參院批准大西洋公約後，提出討論。</p>
<p>諾倫特並稱，渠將要求魏德邁中將出席參院三軍事務委員會作證，如陳納德小將四日在監督委員會之作證然。</p>
<p>民主黨參議員「監督委員會」主席麥卡倫稱，渠對陳納德之作證殊感滿意，並稱公意將壓迫國會通過渠之援華法案。</p>
<p>同時，參院外交委員會主席康納利稱，渠之委員會正忙於聆取大西洋公約，對諾倫特參議員要求全面調查美國對華政策之舉，尚無暇採取行動。</p>
<h3>李代總統藉休養時期　慎密考慮當前局勢　俟獲决定即赴穗主持大計</h3>
<p>〔中央社桂林四日電〕李代總統自四月廿三日由南京返抵桂林後，迄今已近旬日，據總統府發言人宣稱：李代總統因過去數月操勞過度，須稍事休養，方能赴穗，但時局如此危迫，各方對其遲不　行揣測紛紜，廣州方面中央及地方黨政軍首長尤為焦急，除迭電籲請赴穗主持國政外，復推舉代表懇切迎駕，記者為明瞭真相，特走訪接近代總統之某權威人士，承告以李代總統此次出主國政，旨在謀取和平與革新政治，為企求和平之實現，曾以最高之誠意與最大之努力委曲求全，故雖備受黨內外之指摘與中共之冷嘲謾罵，仍一本初衷，進行不懈，不料中共提出「國內和平協定」，其條款之苛刻，無異欲迫我無條件投降，為我政府及全國軍民所不能接受，李代總統曾再電中共，請從新考慮，詎中共悍然不顧實行以武力波江，使我久居水深火熱中之同胞軍罹戰禍之慘，李代總統深為痛心。至於革新政治，三個月來亦因終於形勢，未能有所成就，良堪遺憾。目前時局益趨嚴重，李代總統更認定非澈底改革，勵精圖治，不能振奮人心，團結民主進步之力量，共圖挽救，故藉在桂稍事休養之時期，對當前局勢作全盤慎密之考慮，正隨時與在穗之軍政要員交換意見中。最後，該權威人士並表示李代總統俟上項考慮獲得决定後，即赴穗主持大計云。</p>
<h3>監院通過臨時動議　電李代總統促駕　並修正通過今後工作要點</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州四日電〕監院會議今午通過臨時動議，决電促李代總統早日來穗，主持大計，電文由秘書處擬妥後，即可發出。監院五十次會議，今晨在省審計處繼續舉行，于右任主席，首討論丘念台所提唐鴻烈等五人小組審查修正之有關該院今後工作之議案，激辯達二小時，最後修正通過，確定今後工作要點如次：（一）促成各方團結，集中全國力量，切實負起責任，重整革命陳容。（二）督促政府實施全面改革，並協助其一切革新措施。加强本院工作，整肅政風，穩定經濟，激勵士氣，振奮人心。有關上項工作之具體實施辦法，决交由各委員會研封决定。丘念台·李廷俊·陳訪先等所提廣州郵電諸費，繼湘鄂等地鐵路公路等交通費之後，擅自改收銀元，提高費值，應分別予以糾正案，决定交財政糧政委員會審查。丘李陳三委員又曾提議請指定台灣省為本院人員家屬安置地區，早日籌備遷運安居，此案經宣講後，反對之聲四起，于院長首先表示監院决不能開此惡例，渠稱：「各機關如果都如此，政府非垮台不可」！唐鴻烈·李正樂·張定華等均發言反對，唐鴻烈說：「台北中央日報已經著論大罵遷居台灣的「政治垃圾」，難道我們也要擠到垃圾堆裏去嗎」！一片反對聲中，該案終被打銷。</p>

<h3>社論　制止公用事業指數暴漲</h3>
<p>公用事業計價指數連日暴漲，五日指數竟漲達一百廿五萬倍，陳市長雖就職伊始百事待理，但鑒於公用事業收費過鉅，影響本市六百萬市民的生計甚大，爰乃核减為八十九萬倍。陳市長這樣的關心民生疾苦，固然令人敬佩；但核减的八十九萬倍，仍為一般市民所不勝負担，因為公教人員的發薪指數僅十萬倍，就是一般廠商字號的職工生活指數，也不過三十七萬倍，如何能担負得起八十九萬倍的公用事業！在暴風雨行將襲來的今日，人人都應該抱着「風雨同舟」的精神，一心一德，共撑危局；萬萬不可稍有「乘火打刦」的心理，尤其是公用事業為與民生有切身關係的事業，其收費更應顧及市民負担的能力，何况這幾天來，因為局勢的轉穩人心的稍安，一般物價均起回風，而唯有公用事業單獨上漲，五月三日的指數不過七十九萬倍，四日竟要漲到一百廿五萬倍，不問計算的標準如何，但這種不合理的上漲，是一望而知的。</p>
<p>關於公用事業的收費問題，一直是上海市政中最感棘手的一件事情。三月初公用事業當局異想大開，竟欲以「關元」為計算單位，如此便可使公用事業的價格，天天上漲，只管自己的利益，而置一般市民的生計於不顧；這種荒謬的「自動調整公式」，首先遭到輿論界的抨擊，代表民意的市參議會也極憤慨，一致表示反對。這個「只知利益不顧民生」的辦法終於被迫放棄，改採依照生活指數計價的新辦法。但為時未及二月，各公用事業大呼「吃不消」，並以「虧本過鉅，無法維持」相威脅，市參議會迫不獲已，不得不准許各公用事業改以物價指數按日調整的辦法。但又恐各公用事業漫天討價，乃决定兩項辦法：（一）請市府在維護公用事業供應不斷並顧及市民負担能力的原則內，酌情辦法；（二）先行試辦一個月。</p>
<p>從四月廿五日起開始試辦，所有水，電，電話，電車，公共汽車等公用事業，均依照廿五日指數十四萬倍計價收費，廿九日改為十五萬七千倍，以那時的物價情形而論，十四五萬倍尚屬公平合理，一般市民均稱道公用局的處理得當。但未及數日，公用事業指數，竟一鳴驚人，五月二日為五十九萬倍，三日七十九萬倍，四日一百廿五萬倍，在十天之內，竟漲起九倍，超過任何物價。公用局將向市民說明指數如何計算。不知他們將怎樣說法呢？上漲的不合理，一望而知，何必還要自欺欺人呢！</p>
<p>我們不必高談闊論，即以事實而言，也可以看出，　用事業漲價漲得太過分了。倒如電車，公共汽車的價　，是五月三日調整的，其所依據的指數是七十五萬倍，電車從八萬元起，至十九萬元為止；公共汽車從八萬元起，至二十二萬元為止。兩個人出門，合坐一輛三輪車，所付的車資還要比坐電車公共汽車低廉，所謂公用事業，究以服務為目的呢？還是以賺錢為目的呢？在五月三日開始調整的一天我們曾目睹有不少的乘客，因為袋裏的鈔票不够而被迫下車。假如今天再照一百廿五萬倍計算，則一般市民尤其是薪水階級，均將望電車公共汽車而興歎，有錢乘坐電車或公共汽車的人，要被一般市民視為闊客了。天下荒唐的事情，豈有甚終此者！</p>
<p>又五月三日至四日，上海的物價一致回跌，金鈔小三成，其他商品也隨之下跌，就是米，油，煤，柴，也相當穩定，怎能一夜之隔，就由七十九萬倍漲至一百廿五萬倍？公用事業的罔顧市民的生計，顯而易見，也不必再說了。</p>
<p>在此動亂時期，保衛大上海，安定民生第一，而公用事業有關每一個市民的生計，决不能聽其暴漲，收費漫無標準，使每一個市民都感受到生活的威脅。我們要求陳市長隨時制止公用事業等指數的暴漲，最好能將這試行一月的臨時辦法提早結束，恢復依照生活指數計算的合理辦法。公用局對於公用事業等負有監督和管理的責任，陳市長應責成公用局負起台理調整公用事業價目的責任。</p>
<h3>蘇聯同意西方建議　柏林封鎖本月十二日解除　外長會廿三日在巴黎召開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓四日廣播：據本日所獲可靠消息，蘇聯願意接受五月十二日為同時解除柏林封鎖及西方反封鎖之日期，又五月廿三日為召開四强外長會議日期，地點在巴黎。美國務院發言人四日晨宣稱：四强代表將於四日下午四時半（世界標準時間）在紐約集會，商討解除封鎖及召開外長會議之詳細步驟，英·法兩國代表將初次參加解除對鎖之談判。該發言人曾於本日晨召集新聞記者，報告美代表傑塞普與蘇代表馬立克在紐約商談柏林問題之經過情形，並謂該項非正式談判已進展至可以考慮細節之階段，故請英·法代表共同參加談判。</p>
<p>〔合眾社紐約四日電〕外交官員四日稱，柏林封鎖談判迅速地趨向攤牌階段，據稱，此一關係重大的談判的命運，初步將繫於蘇聯對西方建議的答覆。西方已要求結束美蘇間的會談，而代以四强會商。關於會談後果的緊張局面，三日顯然增加，美國無任所大使傑塞普，英駐聯合國代表賈德幹及法駐聯合國代表簫佛爾三人曾竟日在渠等之辦公室內靜候蘇聯答覆。渠等希望在本週開始對解除柏林蘇聯封鎖及西方反封鎖的技術細則，以及建議中的四强外長會議的議程的討論。據稱，馬立克「充分瞭解」在下週初解除封鎖，並决定在兩週後在巴黎召開四强會議的日期的西方建議。西方官負並不否認傑塞普與馬立克有再度樂行會談一次的可能，但稱，此項會談僅將為佈署使賈德幹及蕭佛爾參加最後階段的會商而舉行。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林三日電〕柏林美國晚報載稱，消息靈通之蘇方人士透露，在下屆討論德國問題之四强外長會議中，蘇外長維辛斯基將有「驚人的讓步」。柏林蘇軍總部透露蘇駐聯合國代表將於五月廿二日返莫斯科，向克林姆宮提出報告。外長會議可於六月一日左右召開。該報謂維辛斯基將建譏設立聯邦德國共和國，其中央機構設在柏林。此舉之先决條件，將為互相承認東德之人民委員會及西德波恩城之議會。該報又曰，蘇聯甚至尚擬作其他讓步，使美國得以放棄組織西德國之計劃。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕德境美國軍政府總督兼美軍司令克萊辭職後，其遣缺將由文官與武將各一人承乏。文職方面，麥克勞將以特派員頭銜處理佔領區行政；武職方面，將由軍人一名指揮歐洲與德境美軍，人選以克拉克將軍或魏德邁中將呼聲最高。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕杜魯門總統正促請國際銀行董事長麥克勞繼克萊出任德境美軍佔領區長官。麥氏曾任陸軍部帮辦，倘若擔任新職，將為德境美國首任最高文官。軍政府改為文官政府，乃美英法三國上月在華盛頓商定者，亦與西德三國佔領區合併計劃有關。麥氏並將擔任盟國最高委員會委員，該會將負責監督未來西德新國之組織與發展。</p>

<p>出席參院外委會作證</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕美陸軍參謀長勃雷特萊今日出席正在審查大西洋公約之參院外委會作證，强調美國第一道安全防綫，係在歐洲之心臟區。渠謂美國人已知美國的金元或武器，本身均不能給予歐洲以安全，西歐必須由西歐人自身救自己。在上次大戰中，在諾曼第登陸的最初十天中，美軍損折二萬一千人之眾，希望今後不致再有此等冒險的軍事行動。其避免之法，厥維給予西歐軍隊以適當的配備及訓練，使其常在備戰狀態之下。相信西歐於獲得援助的保證及抵抗的工具後，必能抵抗任何侵略的威脅。勃氏並指出大西洋公約之十一國，人力逾三億，天然資源及製造武器能力又極豐富及優越，對於西方安全必有極重大的貢獻。</p>

<h3>援歐復興計劃　已產生效果</h3>
<p>艾契遜發表演說</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕美國務卿艾契遜今日在美商會大會中演說，表示自由及民主勢力，可得自西歐最近的發展獲得鼓勵。自歐洲復興方案推動以來，西歐的極權勢力已不能再有進展。在西歐每一次重要選舉中，人民均已明確的表現其對憲法政府的支援，尤其在法義兩國，共黨阻撓復興的企圖，均被政府採取强力行動擊敗。工人已逐漸認識共黨暴動的威脅，由於人民對於未來的信仰漸增，因此生產隨之增加，金融亦趨於穩定。艾氏繼日，為保持經濟復興的動力，必須有大西洋公約輔以軍事援助計劃，對安定勢力給予保障。美援所鼓動的經濟復興動力，已因將受武裝侵略而感不安，北大西洋公約可以消减此種不安心理，使西歐人民得以致其全力於復興事業。</p>

<p>此憲章之起草工作，前由十國大使進行，經過至為便利。十國外長今日起在聖廣姆斯宮中舉行會議，不過對該項憲草履行複查及批准手續而已。就會後發表之公報觀，觀察家相信十國外長於今日開會後，尚有下列四點未曾獲得解决，（一）內閣閣員是否有權參加歐洲議會之議院，（二）歐洲議會中內閣委員會委員是否有權在議院中發言，（三）各參加國財政費用之分担辦法，（四）新組織之正式名稱。一般預料本屆十國外長會結束後，將設立籌備委員會，以進行召開歐洲議會的技術準備工作，其成立會將於八月間在斯特拉斯堡舉行。</p>

<p>伊伐特利用此機會警告參院外委會委員，美國勿應過份重視歐洲局勢，並表示渠對遠東共黨進展的憂慮。共黨勢力的深入，已擴展至印緬及太平洋其他地區，渠誰稱，共黨在中國的進展，至少有一部份係由於美國的忽視亞洲。伊伐特與參院外委會會商的真正目的並未透露，蓋根據傳統，參院主要委員會從未聆取任何外國人士的作證。當伊伐特被詢以在會議中討論何事時，渠答稱，此項會議不過是「老友間交換觀點」而已，渠將在四日與杜魯門總統晤談。關於太平洋局勢，伊伐特深表關懷，美國的忽略亞洲，已使人引起美國並不關注亞洲及蘇聯支持的共黨勢力的進展將無法抗拒乏感。據悉，伊伐特並稱，澳洲擔心日本軍事力量復活，但贊成在經濟上復興日本。</p>

<p>〔中央社仰光四月廿四日通訊〕中共在國內發動戰禍，實欲赤化中國，使成為蘇聯之附庸，過去廿餘年之歷史事實，充分證明，然國內少數智識份子及民主國家，如英美等一部份人民，為共黨及其同路人虛偽宣傳所欺騙，誤認中共為民族主義者，或農村政派，與蘇聯與世界共產主義，均無關係，迄四月四日毛澤東向全世界廣播，攻擊北大西洋公約，並聲言將領導中國為蘇聯而作戰，中共真面目始大白於世，再就中共最近與緬共及北韓政府所締協定觀察，更可設明中共征服亞洲企圖發動全世界反民主。反自由職爭之陰謀，茲探誌兩協定內容如次：</p>
<p>（甲）中共曾於二月廿五日密派章會華，陳家康，杜叔華三人為代表，在緬甸平蠻與緬共簽訂互助協定，條件如次：（一）雙方堅定從事東南亞解放鬥爭任務，對於行動步驟之戰略必須配合，（二）對反英美帝國主義之行動戰略，互相交換情報，（三）對東南亞之反帝國行動須以國際决議為標的，（四）必要時以中共武力在中緬邊界直接支持緬共，並進一步為前哨站，（五）全緬工協，全緬人民民主青年聯盟，全緬學聯與中共當地組織，切取聯絡。</p>
<p>（乙）北韓人民民主政府代表朱憲泳與中共代表林楓，於三月十七日在莫斯科簽訂補充互助協定，內容如左：（一）簽約雙方在互助平等基礎上，共同反抗任何侵略勢力，（二）簽約者一方受到任何帝國全義之攻擊時，應認為是對兩方全體人民之攻擊，須即合作共同行動，並肩作戰，（三）中共應竭盡一切力量，支持北韓人民，爭取朝鮮獨立統一，和平民主發展。（四）在一九四九年七月一日至一九五〇年八月卅日間，中共應以東北軍火，物資，人員充分支助北韓，（五）現有東北區內之日軍技術人員，及日本軍用物資，給北韓優先使用。（六）按照兩國人民經濟發展，需要互相交換物資。（七）為增進雙方對外貿易連繫，應結成連鎖擴展。（八）為遠東與全世界爭取和平合作的鬥爭，雙方對支持全力，保衛蘇聯之安全和平政策，並防禦帝國主義之陰謀攻勢。</p>

<h3>英國工黨</h3>
<p>— 勃萊斯福著　宋桂煌譯</p>
<p>一九二四年，有一個可資紀念的晚間，我得與倫敦的一個出租汽車的司機談話。這天便是麥克康納組織第一次工黨內閣的一天。這位司機對於他的車資，並不表示十分關心，却興致勃勃地想和我討論當時的國家大事。當他談着這位新首相時，他的兩眼光芒四射，我至今猶如目覩。他說，「他是我們隊伍中的一人。他是出生於一個鐵工場中。」今日，工黨已經成了一個公認的機構，惟在手工工人中，至今仍流行着一段關於它的傳說。這種傳說，至今仍新鮮有味，足供談助，並且為工人們的希望的化身。</p>
<p>工人們祇因為了工黨之故，才得第一次在國家命運的途程上發揮他們的力量。今日工人家庭中所生的孩子，已無須和他們的祖父相同，而先天地懷着「劣下感」了。今日他們已不再是世襲的統治階段的唯命是聽的奴僕了。</p>
<p>先驅時代</p>
<p>像這樣的權力基礎的擴大，在英國歷史上已經有過兩次。中等階級的解放曾經耗時兩百年，即自內戰時期以至第一次的改革法案。勞工階級的獲得它的政治平等的地位，曾耗時一百上下。先是奧曼（Robert　Amen）於一八三四年領導生產界組成「全國工會大同盟」，作熱烈的鬥爭。至一九四五年，工黨因組成第一次工黨分子佔大多數的內閣而告成熟，於是最後的目的達到了。第一個半世紀為先驅者的時代，即奧曼派，憲章派，莫理斯，辛德門等的時代。工黨的實際紀錄，僅始於一八九九年，蓋是年哈爾提（Keir　Hardie）勸服了「工會大會」，使之設立了「工人代議委員會」，而工黨即係於一九〇六年從該委員會產生出來。</p>
<p>工黨亦與其他任何政黨相同，其起源是雙軌的。它一方面是為一個特殊的社會階層謀利益，即為工人謀利益，另一方面又追求一種觀念的實現，即社會主為的實現。這種勞工同盟的觀念，為英國所特有。在其他任何國家內，都沒有這種情形。在歐洲大陸上，社會黨的黨員都是以個人資格加入的，只有在英國，工人們一律是通過工會的關係加入工黨的，而經過了將近百年的奮鬥，工人們已無不忠實於其工會。奧曼當初發動工運之始，亦採取了這種政策。</p>
<p>費邊派（Fabians）也是英國勞工同盟中的社會主義者的一部分。他們是一個小組，係由中等階級的知識分子所構成，由韋勃瓦拉斯·蕭伯納·或爾士等思想家所領導，曾發揮了决定性的影響力。不過，使得各工會懷抱作獨立的政冶活動的觀念的，大部分係得力於哈爾提於一八九三年所創立的「國際工黨」。哈爾提本來是一個礦工，在少年時代曾經忍受飢寒與失業的痛苦，因而深知愛護工人，與之共甘苦。他的主要工作，便是勸服前輩人士不再倚賴於仍然信仰「放任政策」的自由黨。起初，他指出，工人們的利益不可仰望於一個為他們的雇主們所支配和津貼的政黨。繼則他又宣傳溫情的，理想主義的，社會主義的福音，而特別着重於倫理道德。他的教義，是一種民主的教義，他並不利用革命的空談。</p>
<p>「工人代議委員會」起初係採中和政策。當時它並無基金，並且起初全國工會會員只有四分之一的人數參加於其中。工黨的本質係規定各工會活動的基礎的兩個合法决議。一九〇〇年，「全國鐵路職工會」被責令對於塔夫威爾鐵路公司因罷工而受的損失，予以賠償。這樣，便無異是使每個工會都解除武裝了。工人們已經失去了他們在產業鬥爭中的唯一武器的有效運用——這武器便是團結的權利。</p>
<p>同時，在一九〇三年，有一部分工會向會員徵收經費，以為競選之基金。因而到了一九〇六年，工黨乃第一次以它的名義，在下院中佔着議席，計得二十九席，由哈爾提任主席。第二次的挑戰，係隨一九〇九年奧斯朋判决而來。蓋該項判决宣布徵收競選活動費為不法，並規定所有工會的政治活動概為罪大惡極。即在這一年，向來是堅定的自由黨分子的礦工，都加入了工黨。一九一〇年，工黨在下院中的議員達四十席，因而擊敗了自由黨政府。一部分因了壓力，一部分因了能够訴於正義感，它終於爭取得自由黨的翻計，而將塔夫威爾及奧斯朋的判决取消。至此，勞工大眾已經認識得，祗就保護他們的工業利益而言，工黨已屬是必不可少的了。哈爾提相信，歐洲的社會主義工人祇須以總罷工為威脅，便能防阻戰爭了。但至一九一四年，因了這種幻想的消滅，他便心灰意懶了。（未完）</p>
<h3>對越南印尼民族運動　美擬承認其合法利益　軍火接濟法軍似確有其事</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕國務院發言人於答覆報紙所傳美國擬以軍火供給越南法軍之報告時聲明，越南及印尼之民族主義份子，其「合法的利益」如獲實現以後，則共產主義在東南亞擴張的可能性，必可為少减少。發言人雖未直接評論以軍火接濟法軍之問題，但表示「木人毋需重申美政府前此所一再聲明之立場，即美國極盼法國及荷蘭得以和平方法解决與越人及印尼人的歧見。美國對此事所感覺的興趣，至今仍未略减。」發言人又曰，外傳俟法荷解决其在東南亞之困難後，即將儘速召開東南亞反共防務會議之說，渠並無所知。按該報告曾曰，參加東南亞反共防務會議者，將有美英法印暹緬越南印尼等。</p>

<p>女子循環决賽今日秩序兩場</p>
<p>四屆市長盃籃球，為謀早日結束起見，今日下午五時起排有三場比賽，女組循環决賽佔其二，綠隊黎隊分戰雅隊鷹隊，另一仗則為男組落選複賽東華與莆隊爭决權，均在市體育館舉行，門券樓上廿萬，樓下四十萬，場內對號八十萬，秩序及裁判名單先錄如次：</p>
<p>黎隊—鷹隊（女組循環）下午五時</p>
<p>綠隊—雅隊（女組循環）五時三刻</p>
<p>東華—莆隊（男落選複）六時卅分</p>
<p>首場女組循環决賽，黎隊與鷹隊相逢，前者本屆聯賽亞軍，諸小將身手敏捷，球藝精純，惟以體格似嫌矮小，打男子規則不無吃虧，初戰雅隊於延長時間始告奏捷，鷹隊在王珊領導下，擁有楊淑君黃品珍王燦華等好手，鬥力充沛，日前與盟主綠隊對壘，綠隊備受威脅，結果該隊僅輸七分，今與黎隊角逐，旗鼓相當，勝負難卜</p>
<p>女决另幕綠隊迎戰雅隊，雅隊轅下有孫鳳竹，朱敏，錢夢月，朱蘭貞等名將，新人汪澤倫役籃尤具把握，自失利於黎隊後，軍心振奮，圖挽令譽，今晚又逢大敵，謹慎演出當有優異成績，綠隊為本市女籃中手屈一指之勁旅，麾下明媛宗　錦芸珍曼麗等個個是傑出之才，鋒銳衛堅，所向無敵，屆時雅隊恐難逃刦運也。</p>
<h3>乙組乒乓聯賽今夕三場角逐</h3>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽主辦當局，頃據若干球隊來稱，以購買用球經費不足，對於練習球賽頗有影響，要求設法解决，茲經該會商得中國乒乓公司同意，儘量以冠軍牌硬球專供球隊作練習之用，配價低廉，凡加入聯賽各隊如需要者，並可以保證金作價抵價四打，自即日起至十日止每日下午一時至三時憑保證金收據向總幹事陳霖笙君領球，地址南京東路一九四號華聯同樂會。該賽今日（五日）續有乙組三場角逐，乙二部公交對中農，前者已棄權一次，此役如再缺席，即將取消比賽資格。另同部星火恐非郵思之敵，又乙三部常勝軍星光出戰綢紅，後者戰績稍差，但有老將林長鑫等參戰，加以乘前日戰勝保險盃勁旅美亞隊之餘成，必予對方以强烈抵抗。茲探錄今日秩序及前賽桔果如下：</p>
<p>今日秩序</p>
<p>公交——中農（乙二）七時中農</p>
<p>星火——郵思（乙二）七時郵思</p>

<p>新星勝明星（乙三）四——一</p>
<p>郵思勝陸聯（乙一）三——二</p>
<h3>高秀清助陣下　龍頭壓倒華光</h3>
<p>龍頭足球球昨得高秀清出場助陣，益見錦上添花，以二比零壓倒華光於南市。龍頭奪取民主杯之希望，乃大為增强。是賽演出精彩，華光雖遭敗挫，而踢來殊出色，同受觀眾之讚許。賽約一刻鐘，姚慶昇自右傳中，張吉良擺渡，王步榮搭住掃射，球從左南穿入，首開紀錄。半小時，龍頭鋒綫挺進，張吉良送球左側，王步榮如法泡製，又中一球，成二對零佔優勢於上半時，亦即最後之結果。休息後，華光進攻甚烈，惜因對方防衛嚴密，夫能有所收穫。</p>

<h3>凱旋路空前火災　二萬人流離失所　廠洋房棚戶三千餘戶</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬西覬旋路長寗路口轉角（即西新街）一帶棚戶，鱗次櫛比，奚止數千戶。不意昨日下午二詩許，該處十六保某棚戶內因煮飯突然失慎起火，頓時烈燄沖需，剎那間延及長寗路路南所有棚戶小型工廠及市房數十間及中國化學廠，啟新橡膠廠等，焚燬殆盡。同時火勢蔓延路北沿街商鋪，復殃及後埭蘇家角內元元橡膠廠大洋房兩幢。斯時，火勢益熾，四週硝皮作，製革廠，搪磁廠，洋釘廠，化學廠等數十家小工業廠，悉遭焚如。嗣大火又沿長寗路花園坊內延燒，計燬詳房五號·七號·九號·十一號·十三號·十五號等七幢。消防處據報，經周處長偕葉總隊長親率總隊帮涌東馳往，先後到達者有嵩山·新開河·靜安寺·宜昌路·新閘·沈家灣·吳興路等區隊部，民辦救火會，除南北市全部外，法華真如等處救火會亦均紛紛趕到協助。無奈該處缺乏海亭水源，啣接困難，甚至利用中山公園水池內抽水接力，雖經各消防員努力施救，然　時費力，功效仍微。且被災各廠中堆置橡膠及化學原料等，均為易燃之物，一經燒着，而勢更不可收拾。起火後，該管法曹警分局副分局長劉耀宸率股長盧秀端，巡官朱允章，便警制服警以及全體義警到場彈壓，維持災場秩序。下午四時過後，記者驅車至愚園路江蘇路口，見路旁觀者途為之塞，西行之東輛一概折回，在中山公園西首排列救火車約有數十輛，宛如長蛇陣，下層馬路積水過脛，變成澤國。迨抵災場，經葉總隊長盧股長等引導巡視四週，兩路旁餘燼未熄，如入火坑，焦熱逼人，實令人難受。及抵起火終點，見路側焚斃一人，好像焦木一段，慘不忍睹，遙望花國坊內洋房數椽，火光熊熊，救火員正忙於工作。當火熾時，消防隊員警受傷者有新閘路區隊分隊長渠尚文，宜昌路六十九號警士，又有消舫警陶永福，陳惇然等數人跌傷和壓傷，均經載送警察醫院療治。大火至六時許方熄，據悉災場面積約廿餘萬平方公尺，延燒三保三千餘戶，約有二萬人均告流離失所，沿途箱籠被　堆積如山。損失之巨，一時無法估計。據當時所知，死者有二人，傷者十餘人。事後市長陳良·警局長毛森·社會局副局長陳保泰等，關心被災難民，先後蒞場，會商賑災，常場令將災民安揷於附近學校社團等處，暫為棲身，一面將由各善團發起向各界呼籲賬濟，深望滬上慈善家踴躍輸將。據葉總隊長云：此次大火，為輓近數十年未有之浩刦，參加施救人員，逾五百餘名，有帮浦車二輛遭燒燬，損壞接水皮帶甚夥。至此次大火之造成，實由於水源困難所致云。聞火首在逃，現該管警分局正查緝中。</p>
<h3>對滬西火災　陳市長廣播</h3>

<h3>米價微疲　食油繼續上漲</h3>
<p>食米市勢，昨日略見下疲，因金價及銀元均平疲，人心不振。北市場白粳薄稻急退至二千萬關，較昨降一百五十萬元。高貨早稻祇做一千八百五十萬，稻米等均跌百萬多。南市場下跌較少，白粳二千〇五十萬，薄稻二千一百二十八萬，各挫二三十萬。糧米銷　，儘有三五石之零交。</p>
<p>食油　當局令不得以銀元呌價，致交易遲遲未開，瀕午始漸開出。初開豆油九千二百萬，收市八千八百萬。生菜油收市七千二百萬元，吉生桶油到過八千萬，收市七千六百萬。但此項價格，並未言明本票或現鈔，價較上日上升數百萬元。豆餅未開。</p>
<p>麵粉　市勢續趨下游，蓋以樹外仍疲，貨主售意頗濃，然市場籌碼缺乏，進戶多存觀望，故脚地殊為虛軟。老車初市五百五十萬，收市退做五百廿萬元。兵船是開四百七十萬，後市逐步趕疲，以四百四十萬成交。麩皮供求兩漢，市勢平疲未開，大包喊站四百萬。</p>
<h3>市場失其常態　證交暫停集會</h3>
<p>證券交易所以市場交易失其常態，業務幾已停頓，經召集第一屆第十四次理監事聯席會講議决，自卅八年五月五日起，暫停市場集會云。華股市况，昨日走勢仍稍，冷熱門股場內仍老路舊循，呌價均以限度開盤，至午未有交易，場外旋即展開暗盤交易，惟因各物疲軟，人心亦平，交易亦頗沈寂。永紗十萬股喊本票一億四進，一億五出，但成交極鮮。美亞新光景福勤興信和等暗盤加碼一億左右，其餘未聞後市納胃寥落，供者亦稀，交易無形冷落，各股除華豐台糖閘北水電在漲限呌買外，其蝕寂寂無聞，蒞場人員亦大見减少，各證券號客戶亦無，往日之熱鬧情勢頗冷。</p>
<p>金債漲停</p>
<p>黃金公債趨勢，晨開城一八九一二〇〇〇元停板價買進，收市無賣出，全日仍無成交。</p>
<h3>金市人心虛怯　低盤進入二關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市况，因本票限期收回，時間迫近，行莊本票，今天起已不能開發，籌碼週轉失靈，加以銀根趨緊，人心更康，在一片賣出聲中，市呈江河日下之勢。場外現貨晨開二億三，二億六，為當日之高盤。開後步趨下降，退入二關，做一億九，二億一，最小曾低一億七，二億。午收稍見回上，為二億，二然三。午後交易冷落，喊低至一億九，二億二。</p>
<p>美鈔場外在供多求少下，仍形軟化，晨開四五〇萬五〇〇萬，曾小至三八〇萬四三〇萬，午收四〇〇萬四五〇萬。午後買戶稀少，喊低至三八〇萬，四三〇萬，較上日再小二成光景。</p>
<h3>現鈔籌碼漸裕　銀元午後轉高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀元市况，昨日平中帶　。一般商號，登記執照，大多領到，已恢復交易，但掛牌之價，高低不一，進出之距離，頗不一致。低者差二十萬，高者竟差四十萬。馬路銀牛，數量大减，但地下交易，仍甚活躍，行蹤極為詭秘。現鈔交易，大頭上午普通做三五〇萬，三八〇萬。本票交易已見减少，商號有做五〇〇萬進，六〇〇萬出，有做四五〇萬，五五〇萬，也有五〇〇萬只進勿出，各家不同。午後因現鈔籌碼轉裕，散戶頗有胃口，最後大頭喊高至三八〇萬，四〇〇萬。本票交易稍有上落，央行定額本票做四〇〇萬，五〇〇萬。行局本票做四五〇萬，五五〇萬。行莊本票做五〇〇萬，六〇〇萬，較七日軋漲四〇萬。</p>
<h3>紗布一致回瀉</h3>
<p>棉紗，因圈外金價續瀉，行莊本票今起收回，市上信用緊縮，銀根走勢一致看緊，故人心甚平，粗細紗再告回瀉。四十二支藍鳳做七八〇〇〇萬，續跌一七〇〇〇萬·四十支三十二支一致軋小二億二千餘萬，二十一支雙馬棧單，做四四〇〇〇萬，軋小六〇〇〇萬。現貨四八〇〇〇萬，退落九五〇〇萬。二十支以下一致均疲。</p>
<p>棉布海內仍未做開。場外喊價初平繼疲，至九時一刻許，喊做始見熱鬧。各方賣氣轉盛，多方恐慌，至十時半許龍頭細布，及四君子嗶嘰約為一千四百萬左右。較上日再見微挫。民營廠商為籌發薪津，存貨頻有吐售，市勢亦疲，廠盤互有升降，惟起伏俱微。</p>

<h3>公用指數不斷暴漲　勢將引起嚴重後果　市民無力負擔工商一致呌苦　希當局迅予糾正</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公用事業計價指數，近一週來狂漲暴騰，已引起全市市民極大反感，本報連日接獲各界對「公用指數」提供意見與呼籲制止暴漲及責問之函件，日達數十起，一致認為公教指數尚僅十萬倍，計薪指數亦僅三十七萬餘倍，而昨日「公用指數」竟達一百廿五萬倍，（經陳市長核减後仍高達八十九萬倍），且逐日調整，每天上漲，少則十餘萬倍，多達二十餘萬倍，其上漲率之暴且速，殊足令人咋舌。查四月二十五日公用指數為十四萬倍，二十九日為十五萬七千倍，卅日為十九萬四千倍，五月一日為四十五萬二千倍，二日為五十九萬倍，三日七十九萬倍，四日經核减後，仍為八十九萬倍，今日且已躍至九十五萬倍，在短短十日之間，上漲率竟達九倍之鉅。</p>
<p>一普通職員應付的費用</p>
<p>若以一普底薪為八十元，乘四月底之生活指數，又假定最低限度每月用電為十四度通職員而三七一，三四四倍，四月份實得薪水，用水為十九度，結算應付水電單位論，假定共為二千九百七十萬〇七千五百廿元如下：</p>
<p>用電　1至10度　每度基價單位0．220＝基價單位2.20　11至14度　第二度基價單位0.274＝總結單位1.70　3.30+附加稅10％＝0.33＝總結單位3.63</p>
<p>用水　19度　每度基價單位0.279＝總結單位5.30</p>
<p>以上水電兩項共計單位八·九三，若照今日之公用指數九五〇·〇〇〇倍結算，則須付金圓劵八百四十八萬三千五百元，已占其薪水之百分之三十，所餘僅為百分之七十，試問將何以維持其他一切日常生活乎？况抄表之期，各戶不同，筍帳單送到而在下旬，則以公用指數日漲不已，恃計薪指數為收入之薪水階級，更何堪應付如此無窮盡之負擔。</p>
<p>領導漲風後患堪虞</p>
<p>然民非水火不生，又不能捨此而別圖，當此時局緊張，安定第一，若任其漲無止境，不惟威脅市民生計，必有無力支付之日，即各工廠以用電為動力所寄，亦必因電費支出過鉅，而被迫停頓，影響數百萬職工生活，尤為嚴重。且前次各公用事業公司，要求以關元結價，經市參議會反對中止，惟關元上落係按照外匯轉移證之市價而定，最近外匯證波動並不劇烈，故當時縱令以關元結價，其漲度恐亦未必即如目前之暴，　以關金結價而反對之，今乃以甚於關金之公用指數，而任其採用，不加制止，豈得謂之合現乎？</p>
<p>即又有進者，近日若干奸商高抬其商品售價，或有詢其漲價何速，渠必答曰：「向公用事業看齊！」故公用指數之暴漲，不惟領導漲風，抑且使目前金融危機狀况下，益滋混亂，深盼市政及治安當局，顧念非常時期，民生之艱困，工業之危機，迅予補救。</p>
<p>參議員指出許多不合理</p>
<p>記者復以此事訪問某參議員，據稱，公用指數連日暴漲，殊不合理，並舉理由如下：（一）據渠所知，凡市府所屬職員，均可獲得「水電代價劵」，在若干限度之內，付款時可以此項代價券作抵。試問同為上海市市民，何以不獲此種優待？（二）公用事業公司職員之待遇，較任何機關為優，當此非常待朔，勵行節約之際，何可以五百萬市民之血汗，供少數從業員之過分享受？（三）最近美鈔·銀圓·以及一般物價，因當局之嚴厲管制，均告下跌何以公用指數一若有特無恐，直飛沖天，（四）本市已進入戰時狀態，為保衛大上海，加强作戰力量起見，一切自以維護治安為第一，今全市已面臨經濟總崩潰之危機，若長此以往，前途將不堪設想，究其原因，公用指數之一再暴漲，實為唯一因素。為解救目前危機起見，渠建議：（一）目下潘議長方離滬赴穗，應請徐副議長迅即召集參會公用小組，或全體緊急會議，商討對策。（二）應請軍事當局會同陳市長迅速採取有效制止辦法，以蘇民困。</p>
<p>棉紡公會籲請糾正</p>
<p>蘇浙皖京滬區棉紡公會昨日舉行常務理事會時，會以該業用電特多，而近日電費計價指數，逐日調整，其增漲率超越一般物價之上，奚啻倍蓰，雖謂是項指數計算，另具標準，但迄未蒙公佈，殊為不解。且時際非常，各工廠營業停頓，對此上漲漫無止境之鉅額電費，實已無力支付，决定除分別呈函市政府，市社會局，市公用局暨市工業會，市商會，籲請設法糾正抑平外，並推定朱扶九，韓志明，王子建三理事，分向上列各機關陳述困難實情，請予補救云。</p>

<h3>「蘭展」在台灣　琉球是一塊「重光土地」</h3>
<p>— 景東</p>
<p>〔台北廿六日訊〕在台北近郊士林鎮的園藝試驗所（該所隸屬於台灣省農業試驗所），從四月十七日起舉行了為期兩週的蘭花展覽會。洋蘭現有大者約近萬株，小者有五萬至六萬株的數目，真是洋洋大觀。現在正開花的有蝴蝶蘭千餘株，石斛蘭五百餘株和西蘭百餘株，其中最名貴的是C.　Cltftarii　Maya　fica及B.Laulra　品種，現值盛開時節，集於一室，從事展覽。就品質和數量來說，不僅是打破歷年遠東展覽的記錄，而且也是世界蘭展的傑出者。該所成立已有四十多年，這是光復後第六次的展覽（日本時代只有二五〇盆）。第一次展覽只有三盆，去年秋季的第五次展覽，也只有三百盆。蘭花的培養艱難，這次盛開的蘭花最少已培植了七年之久了。此外該所還從事於柑橘的育種，栽培，移殖，卅五年春季開始熱帶菓林，咖啡葡萄和蔬菜的引種栽培試驗</p>
<p>台灣中華國貿公司的負責人表示，以該公司去年四月十五日創立初時的每日售出貸款和進店顧客人數與目前比較可以證明本省同胞目前的購買力，較諸一年前已見大為薄弱了，過去一年間全省內的物價，平均上漲三十倍，例如熱水瓶的價格，一年以前每個台幣六千元，目前為台幣二十萬元；各種儭衫，一年前每件四千元，現在要十二萬元；而該公司每天售出的貨款，一年前為三百萬元，現在是一億元。但每日進店的顧客平均人數，現在是五千人，較一年前的四千元則增加了一千。由此可見省內人民的購買力較一年前已見薄弱了。</p>
<p>在台灣的琉球革命同志會會長蔡璋，頃就琉球問題發表談話。他認為在目前複雜的國際情勢下，為琉球歸趨問題明朗化起見，應重喚起各方的注意。他說：從聯合國勝利以後，不幸國際局勢轉變，關於琉球歸趨問題亦竟違反聯合國最初對琉球的神聖措置，招與了為弱小民族解放運動所不滿的變態局勢，殊為遺憾！琉球脫離日本版圖為公理上當然的事，在法理·經濟·歷史，民族上均無可非難的。民國卅六年六月五日，日本政府提出的所謂「為顧及日本的感情。故要求收回「琉球」的問題，實僅係軍方變相的帝國主義者的一貫手段的空論而已。並稱：我們敢斷言，日本已然任何對琉球的要求的發言權，琉球受日本七十多年的榨取，原未得琉球和中國的同意，現縱有極少琉球人希望歸屬日本，這也是壓迫不得已的墮落心理。多數人都承認已脫離日本，更覺醒於琉球復興的重要。琉球自古以來得免於毀滅，實由於宗邦中國的庇護，中琉的結合實為公理所必然。他又說：比如最近關於台灣地位的謠流佈，明明是國際陰謀家所指撥，正和故意把琉球和日本視同一體的歪曲宣傳相等，台灣固應是中國永有的領土，琉球也應是中國的一塊重光土地，我們今後要時加警覺和精誠合作，以免上國際陰謀家的大當。</p>
<p>國立台灣大學校長傅斯年，最近很不願意和新聞記者談話。前天一個偶然的機會，傅氏在台大被記者們包圍，他對這次學生被捕事，不願有所發表，提到台大內部問題，傅氏大傷腦筋，他說頭都痛了，如最近學校內的東西時常被偷，儀器室內幾個價值兩億台幣的鏡頭，忽然不見，經縣賞五百萬元，幸人贓俱獲；又各學院內房子被人頂出，還有教授不上課去跑單帮，請人代課，代課的也跑不見。諸如此類，非得整理不可！提到政治問題，傅氏稱：目前我因做大學校長，不便發表政見，其實悶得慌，可是爲了使學校形成一種學術研究的空氣自然由我起不談政治，否則校長可談，則學生可就可談了。傅氏以一個故事為例，他說：有人建了一所新房屋，牆壁粉刷一新，為防止有人亂塗牆壁起見，特在牆寫了「此墻不能畫」五個字，有一個頑皮孩子，在後面加了一句是「為何你要畫」？這位看來便又寫了一句是「我墻我能畫」，可是那個頑皮的孩子，又接上一句是「要畫大家畫」。這是傅氏說的故事，也可看出他的心境，所以他感到悶得慌了。另一記者問他，這次看過宋子文沒有？他大笑起來說：「那我怎麼去看，自我罵他以後，我們曾見過一面，是不講話的。最近我想到草山溫泉去洗個澡，休息一下因為他在草山，所以都沒有去」。記者說，你是怕他嗎？校長先生又一笑說，那我怎能怕他，傅氏還說了個笑話：前天美國領事請客，他本想去，後來他太太說，或許請宋子文的，結果打電話去問，如有宋子文在座，便不去，但美領事並未請宋氏。不過美領事問傅氏。爲什麽有宋在座就不去。傅氏向那位領事說：「你未免太不明白中國的事情了。」</p>
<h3>粵省走私路線透視</h3>
<p>〔廣州一日航訊〕廣東走私的路綫，最主要的可分海陸兩綫，雖然從飛機走私的也有，但這很少，因為成本重，等間或笨重的貨物都用不着。</p>
<p>從海路走私進口中也可分幾個形式：（一）集零而整式，先是由一家私梟公司派出大批人員將貨分散携带分搭省港輪船回穗，抵目的地後，再到事前預定的地方集合，而將貨物成批沽發或交付本市行莊，這種形式的私梟，資金不但不多，且難產生領導作用。他們走進的多以西藥·黃金·絨布等輕便東西。（二）流亡式，這種形式多由行走省港輪，內部的人自己做，但來勢相當兇，船上內部的人集資而成，有時船上整個倉下的貨物都是私貨。他們利用熟悉易於掩護所以走起上來甚為安全，但這種形式私梟們做的也有，因為他們可以用相當的代價而把船上買通了做，假如是船上人自己做的話，他們大概携带是香烟·車胎·或易於脫手的貨物。（三）勢力式，這一種無論規模·背景·資金比較健全，也稱得上雄厚，所以，他們走私起來並不十分秘密，大概是用錢或勢力關係，事先把每個關卡打通，然後公開的用船　由港儎貨直駛回市，但並不直到廣州，只到廣州附近卸貨，再由小艇轉駁入市，這種組織多屬是失意政客生意失敗的商人合股而成，由於幕後有背景，所以被發現或緝拿的很少。據內行的人說，這種形式的走私雖然安全，但利潤很薄，因為他們對各方面的應酬支出太大。</p>
<p>除上述三種以外，更有一種強硬式，這種機構是設於香港或九龍附近的鄉鎮上，如東莞·太平·市橋·深圳等地均有，而這種組織也是當地的有力人士組織，他們的力量是龐大無比的，公司的全部資金，往往無法估計，他們每家公司擁有一百幾十艘高速率的而裝有強霸武裝，走私的方法是乘一個月中的幾晚夜由港落貨儎回，假使途中不幸被海關艦艇發現，可逃的就逃，否則他們就集中幾十艘的火力抵抗，所以這一種走私在海關人員心目中一向是認為最忌的，由於這種組織和資金都十分雄厚，所以他們甚麼都走入有化算，而也即是說，他們甚麼東西都有走私入口。</p>
<p>陸路走私</p>
<p>除了幾個從水路可以走私入口之外，還有部份是從陸路的。</p>
<p>（一）飛機式，在火車上跑車頂，跳車站的，這種三五成羣，手携小包物件的人，而也就是負着走私任務的私梟了，這種私貨在表面上，雖是很像各有各的，其實他們每個都有他的巢口，他們上上落落於廣州·香港之間，大都替公司服務而已，這種私梟內行人稱為「飛機仔」，他們大多受僱於走私公司的，聞或自己做的也有，這種走私公司大多資金不大。</p>
<p>（二）分潤式，廣九火車中的礦工和下級的服務生及司廚大家夾股，每在自己班車開港時候利用空間的時期下車赴港購物上車放在秘密的地方儎回，有時他們也聯絡車上的私梟替他們散水，購到的利潤大家瓜分，這種的作用不大。</p>
<p>（三）遊動式，這種形式的組織頗為龐大，但他們總機構沒有一定的地址，不過總是在廣州外圍，港九附近，他們除了用錢打過關卡而外，並配備犀利的武裝保護私貨入口，這種形式來得十分兇猛的，大卡車十車八車一輪的由九龍直向內地衝入，照內行的人說，這種形式最多是在文錦渡出現，他們大都和關卡事前預定時間入口，屆時關卡的人行開，事後則由公司方面照大家協約交回費用。</p>
<p>出口走私</p>
<p>除了進口走私貨物之外，廣州更有貨物走私出口，貨物走私出口在表面上雖然似乎很少，一般人以為只糧食出口而已，其實並不如是簡單，內行的人指出，除糧食以外，更有出口貨物土布及甚多的雜物荳子。</p>
<p>出口走私的方式雖不與入口走私盡同，然而，特顯的地方不多，只是從水路運出佔百分之八十，比較特別而已，照內行的人說，出口走私的走法很奧妙，大多是先將貨物運出廣州外圍附近的鄉村市鎮，放存十日或半個月後才想法運出，以去年計，最為私梟歡喜彙集貨物的地方以黃竹歧附近，市橋·東莞太平·或萬頃沙，今年由於各地商業不景氣，除大多停業不做外，做的也多從新佈置路綫，如目前西南至澳門綫的興旺，便是說明今年走私路綫的不同。去年走私出口和進口的確實數字，雖然甚難得到正確的統計，然而照一般內行人的估計，從事走私入口的人不下三萬人之多，而出口走私的也有一萬五千至一萬八千人之　（這數字統屬在市內活動）如加上四鄉外圍的人數，相信有十萬人之巨。</p>

<h3>都江堰水利工程　從防患到改進的途中</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都廿八日航訊〕都江堰－福利川西平原二千餘年的水利工程，兩年來，由於堰流失節，川西連遭洪泛，使一般對此偉大工程，引起重新評價與更加注意。爲了看看兩年來的工程變化，記者特地到都江堰參觀放水典禮。</p>
<p>成都平原灌溉總樞</p>
<p>從成都到灌縣，一百華里的廣坦平原，這是天府之國精華所在，沿途溝渠紛紜，阡陌交錯；因為成都平原的成長，是岷江水流沖積而成的沖積扇，都江堰實為平原灌溉的總樞紐。二千多年前，李冰父子　開離堆，築都江堰，分內外兩江，　傳治水箴言，迄到現在，都江堰全部工程，包括：（一）百丈堤及挑水壩，用以護岸及逼水量入正道。（二）新工魚嘴，作為內江引水口。（三）榪槎，調節水量。（四）平水漕，宣洩餘水。（五）飛沙堰，防水橫決。（六）賓瓶口，測量水位。這綿亘四里許的都江全堰，規模依舊。登二郎廟，石壁刻劃的李氏父子治堰真訣，讃到他指示後世要：「深淵難，低築堰……歲勤修，預防患」，正值禮砲隆隆，香烟繚繞，從莊嚴肅穆的氣氛中，意味前賢遺制的偉大。主持祭儀職司水利的四川水利局，連年忽視「預防患」，以致不能「歲勤修」，令人深深感覺，宏規猶存，遺訓宛在，時代進步了二千年，瞻祭前賢，今人應該感到無限愧怍。</p>
<p>工程史上幾度改革</p>
<p>二郎廟後進奉祀丁文誠（實楨），每年歲祭李氏父子時同時附祀，丁寶楨在四川，遺愛與治績給川人印象甚佳，尤其他是都江堰工程第一位改革者。當前清成同之際，丁寶楨任四川總督，研究都江水利，深感每年歲修的病民，並鑒於竹籠石埂的不堅固，於是改用鐵柱石墩代替，累年與修，耗費無算，但不幸工程甫竣，即遭洪流沖毀，因之慘遭失敗。丁的失敗，在他本身得到「革職卸任」處分，但他高瞻遠矚的眼光，勇敢改革的勢力，給予後世以深刻啓示。民國以還，軍閥爭權，水利經費，盡被挪移，大修歲修，全告停頓，以迄近年，都江堰堤常潰，川西時遭洪泛，水利局才有澈底大修計劃。但不幸限於經費支絀，祗能從漸進着手，堰工處在去年接受新法，用水泥洋灰代替竹籠石埂。去年度在飛沙堰修築十二丈長的水泥洋灰工程，今年度續修十丈，預計飛沙堰全長八十丈，五六年後始可全部改造完竣，這又是現在愧對丁文誠的地方。</p>
<p>飛沙修堰改用新法</p>
<p>看罷開水堰工處領導參觀全堰新工程，據該處負責人解釋：今年主要工程，在飛沙堰建築水泥平水漕，遠較竹籠工程堅固。其功用在內江水小時，可保持水量不外溢，內江水大，可藉此漕排水外出，並保證今年的飛沙堰，不致再遭洪水沖毀。至於永久計劃，將在都江堰上設大水閘，調劑雨量，斷流淗河，以代替馬槎，融洽中西工程之長，對都江堰作澈底改進。但這計劃何日成功？則任何人都不能担保的。</p>
<p>川西人民對都江堰及手創此偉大工程的李太守父子，具有最崇誠的景仰，今年開堰，在省府緊縮開支並不擴大舉行情形下，四方觀禮民衆，猶有六七萬人。尤其川西兩年洪水慘刻教訓，一般人希望更熱切寄託在未來工程的興修。記者看到岷江洪流，隨馬槎砍倒，滔滔滾滾，崩騰疾瀉，與成灌道上，絡繹於途的千層人浪，引起合流，更體騐到都江堰工程的防患改進，實在刻不容緩了。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military authorities issued a war bulletin at 9:30 PM on the 4th: (1) The situation in Kunshan and Taicang remains unchanged. The local communists who briefly caused disturbances in Liuhe yesterday have been completely eliminated by our forces. (2) Since our army proactively abandoned Hangzhou, only a small number of local communists have infiltrated the suburbs to carry out activities. The main force of the communist army has not yet arrived. (3) The railroad bridges between Hangzhou and Jiaxing have been thoroughly destroyed by us, making it extremely difficult for the communist heavy weapons to pass through. Train service on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway can reach Jiaxing directly. Jiaxing and Pingwang are still firmly defended by a unit of our army, with heavy troops stationed along the line. If the communists invade, they will be severely attacked. (4) On the afternoon of the 3rd, three regiments of communist troops with an unknown designation, accompanied by over a hundred carts, advanced eastward from Nanxun towards Zhenze. (5) Over three thousand communist troops, divided into groups, infiltrated Chun'an, Suian, Yuqian and other places on the evening of the 3rd. Telegraph communications with these areas have now been severed. (6) After the communist invasion and capture of Wuxi and Suzhou, in addition to leaving a small number of troops in each county to establish military control commissions, the majority of their main force marched south along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. The communist troops along the railway line are now moving back and forth daily, creating confusion. They have also ordered residents to report their grain reserves within a limited time and levied 40% of it. Those who do not comply will have their property confiscated and severely punished. Residents fear them like snakes and scorpions and have established anti-communist committees.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military authorities announced at 10:00 AM on the 4th: (1) Due to strategic considerations, Hangzhou no longer has any value for defense. Our army has proactively withdrawn to the second line of defense. The situation in Hangzhou (on the 3rd) evening is unclear. (2) Hanchuan was recovered by our army at noon on the 3rd. (3) The main force of the Communist 23rd Army is still in the Nanxun and Zhenze area. A unit of over a thousand infiltrated Yanmu and Wuzhen on the evening of the 3rd.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] The Shanghai-Hangzhou train line was open to Jiaxing on the 4th. Three trains carrying troops departing from this city have all arrived safely. Railway employees at Wangdian, Xiashi, Xieqiao, Zhouwangmiao and Chang'an stations are still able to maintain contact with the Shanghai General Bureau via the Railway Bureau's dedicated dispatch telephone. The Beijing-Shanghai line is still open to Lujiabang. Yesterday, there were three round trips on both lines, but there were very few passengers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang Dispatch, 4th] Military news: (1) A small group of communist troops has been discovered in the Tongqianli area on the border between Wannian and Guixi, showing signs of advancing towards Guixi and Yiyang. (2) Poyang was on alert yesterday. The National Army is closely monitoring the situation.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Detained in Beiping; Guo Jiyao Appointed Acting Northwest Military and Political Governor; Executive Yuan Resolved in Yesterday's Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] General Zhang Zhizhong, Northwest Military and Political Governor, has been detained in Beiping by the Communist Party, preventing him from returning to his post in the Northwest to perform his duties. The Executive Yuan resolved in yesterday’s meeting to remove Zhang from his position and appoint Deputy Governor Guo Jiyao as acting governor. It is reported that after arriving in Beiping on April 1st as the chief representative of the government’s peace negotiation delegation, Zhang devoted himself day and night to discussions with the communist side in a spirit of bearing humiliation and responsibility, hoping to achieve a reasonable and just lasting peace. It was originally hoped that the Communist Party would recognize its past mistakes, be open and honest, and work together to achieve true peace, to relieve the people from suffering and prevent the country from falling into a state of irrecoverable ruin. However, after three weeks of negotiations, the Communist Party not only showed no sincerity but responded to the government’s request for a temporary ceasefire agreement with a general offensive order. Thereafter, the Communist Party simultaneously launched a large-scale crossing of the Yangtze River and detained the entire government peace negotiation delegation, revealing their despicable conspiracy. In light of this, the government recently revoked the name of the government peace negotiation delegation, and yesterday also removed Zhang from his position as Northwest Military and Political Governor. Since Zhang is detained in Beiping and unable to perform his duties, and the important military and political matters of the Northwest cannot be without someone in charge for a single day, the government had no choice but to take this necessary measure.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] The Executive Yuan held its 58th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 4th. President He presided over the meeting.

(2) Deputy Governor Guo Jiyao was appointed as acting Northwest Administrative Governor.</p>

<h3>Yangtze River Fleet Safely Withdraws to Engage in New Combat Missions; Xing'an and Weihai Ships Destroyed</h3>
<p>Spokesman for Naval Headquarters Speaks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] According to the spokesman for the Naval Headquarters, the Navy's Yangtze River Fleet has been defending the Yangtze River in coordination with friendly forces for three months. Thanks to the brave struggle of the officers and soldiers, despite the difficult and treacherous environment of fighting with their backs to the river on a 500-mile front, they were still able to accomplish the expected tasks. Since Nanjing's strategic retreat, the defensive value of the Yangtze River has been lost. In order to adapt to new strategic needs, the Navy withdrew the Yangtze River Fleet. All the ships in the fleet, except for the Xing'an and Weihai, which were severely damaged and ran aground near Jiangyin due to rudder damage, making them impossible to sail out and thus seized by the communists, the remaining thirteen ships, including the Yongjia, have all safely withdrawn to the expected area. The Yongding and Yongxiu, which were operating around Anqing, and the Yixian and Xinyang, which were threatened by the enemy who had betrayed the Jiangyin Fortress and were blockading the area, have also been safely withdrawn. They are now engaging in another combat mission in the new strategic area. In order to ensure water safety, the Navy has dispatched aircraft to completely destroy the above-mentioned two ships seized by the communists.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Overcrowded; Ship and Air Tickets to Leave Hong Kong Sold Out for Four to Five Months; British and American Consulates in South China Advise Guangdong and Guangxi Overseas Chinese to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong Dispatch, 3rd] If the number of evacuees entering Hong Kong continues unabated, the situation here will become extremely serious, as there is a severe shortage of ships leaving Hong Kong. Ship and air tickets leaving Hong Kong have been sold out for four to five months. British and American consuls in South China are now advising their respective nationals to evacuate from Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and "return directly to their home countries," but these evacuees will inevitably gather in Hong Kong, waiting for ships and airplanes. The Dutch mail ship Boissevain, which arrived here on Monday, carried 800 evacuees from Shanghai, including 55 British nationals, none of whom have obtained accommodation. More ships will arrive in the coming days, and hotels and other accommodations are overcrowded. Evacuees are currently living in seamen's dormitories and refugee shelters.</p>

They also said that American airplanes and ships are available.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco Dispatch, 3rd] Pan American Airlines announced today that the crowding of foreign nationals evacuating from Shanghai has eased. According to a radio report from the Shanghai management office, there is no need to add special flights.

He solemnly denied the possibility that the British government has considered or recognized the Chinese Communist regime. The spokesman admitted that British consular officials in the Communist-controlled areas have been ordered to contact the Communist authorities to protect the lives and property of British nationals, but stated that this action is by no means the same as recognizing the Communist regime or establishing diplomatic relations with it. Asked whether British consuls in the Communist areas, especially the British consuls in Beiping and Nanjing, have obtained contact with the Communist Party, the spokesman replied "not yet".</p>

<h3>In Order to Prevent a Tragic Situation in the Pacific, Military and Economic Aid to China Must Be Stepped Up: Chennault Urgently Appeals Before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Major General Chennault predicted on the 3rd that if the Communists are not contained in China, both Japan and the Philippines will be Red.</p>
<p>Chennault testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, scoffing at the supposed defensive value of the "island chain" off the Asian coast, and predicted that the Soviet Union would have a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere from the Bering Strait to Bali. Mr. Chen then asked, "In such circumstances, what will be the situation of Pearl Harbor, Midway Island, Guam, Wake Island, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, and the smaller islands in the Pacific? It is simply foolish for us to think that we can defend the Pacific from this side of the Pacific."</p>
<p>Republican Senator Knowland then spoke in the Senate, asking all senators to read Chennault's testimony.</p>
<p>Chennault reiterated that the only way to prevent a tragic situation is to provide military and economic aid to China. Mr. Chen then described how fragile the defense forces of Southeast Asia are, and then stated that the assassination of Mrs. Quezon and her daughter a few days ago, less than a hundred miles from Manila, proved that the Communist-led peasant army is still seriously disrupting the Philippines.</p>
<p>The United States Should Act Quickly</p>
<p>Mr. Chen continued that unless the United States acts quickly, the Chinese Communists will reach the borders of Vietnam, where Ho Chi Minh, trained by Moscow, has established his Communist regime. It is expected that Ho Chi Minh will receive assistance from China, and his power will expand to the rest of Vietnam. Thereafter, Siam will be surrounded on two sides, and the fall of that country will open the gateway to Malaya. Then Burma and the Indonesian archipelago will also fall one after another. The Communist occupation of Southeast Asia will place severe pressure on India and encourage the Soviet Union to advance again into the urgent Middle East. It is an optimistic fantasy to think that if all of Asia is in Communist hands, Japan and the Philippines will still peacefully remain on the American side, unless the United States adopts a "cruel imperialist" policy and makes Japan a colony, otherwise the Japanese will become vassals of Asia under Communist rule and there is no other way to go. "Therefore, I foresee that at the end of the easy path we are currently taking, there will be a "Communist Japan."</p>
<p>Chennault suggested that the United States provide assistance, followed by U.S. supervision, saying, "Mr. Jones' practice is that when he allocates huge government loans, he sends people to accompany the money to make sure how it is used." The Chinese do not object to this, as evidenced by the "significant progress" made under the leadership of Lieutenant General Wedemeyer. "If Wedemeyer could continue the excellent work he started in wartime in peacetime, I am sure we would have no problems now."</p>
<p>Chennault separately appealed for China to the Congressional Joint Committee on Foreign Aid and the Senate Armed Services Committee, and mentioned his emotional connection to China, including his Chinese wife. His wife was always present during Mr. Chen's testimony. Mr. Chen expressed his willingness to sell his airline operating in China and contribute his own strength to the U.S. aid program to China. After attending the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Chen told the press that he expected the CCP to be blocked in Changsha and Hengyang, which are the main routes into the interior and south of China.</p>
<p>Approximately One Million Yuan is Needed Daily</p>
<p>According to Senator Tydings, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chennault estimated that maintaining the operation "would cost approximately one million yuan per day." Asked how long this expenditure would last, Mr. Tydings replied that this involves "any possible plan that can be effective," so he could not comment.</p>
<p>Chennault also told reporters that he believed General Bai Chongxi would retreat from Hankou to Changsha, and that both Changsha and Hengyang were easy to defend. Mr. Chen avoided answering directly the question of whether President Chiang would take over the active leadership of defending South China, saying only, "I believe they have already drafted a plan to defend the area, and I don't think they will waste lives trying to hold Hankou." Mr. Chen also said that the Communists only have two possible routes to South China: one is by sea and the other is by land, from the Hangzhou and Hankou areas, along the railway and highway lines to Changsha and Hengyang. The Communist army will not move along the sea route. If they move along the land route, if the National Army strongly defends Changsha, the Communist army will not be able to cross Changsha. Therefore, the United States must provide assistance so that it can hold the area. Asked why Taiwan would be difficult to defend if the mainland fell, Mr. Chen replied, "It cannot be used as a base for attack." He also said that he had not spoken to MacArthur recently, but his opinion was based on MacArthur's views, because when the Communist army occupied Shenyang, MacArthur had asked Washington to send four divisions to strengthen Japan's defense forces. MacArthur's request indicated that MacArthur believed that the Communist army's gains in the north had already threatened Japan from the side. The Communist "chain reaction" throughout the Far East poses a major threat.</p>
<p>The Core of Resisting the Communist Party</p>
<p>Chennault pointed out that the five provinces of China and the Northwest, where Muslim forces are strong, are the potential core of resisting Communism, saying, "If we decide that for national security reasons, we must adopt a concrete action policy in Asia, aimed at containing and suppressing the Communists in Asia, then in addition to the money of American taxpayers, there are many other forces that can be used to fight and work. The traditional forces of local autonomy have always been strong in Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and the Muslim Northwest of China, and their leaders have the determination to resist being conquered.</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Knowland Requests Wedemeyer to Testify</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The movement to add provisions for military assistance to the Nationalist Chinese government to the arms aid plan for Europe showed signs on the 4th, with Republican Senator Knowland stating that he would propose the above amendment when the arms bill is submitted to Congress. The military aid bill will be submitted for discussion after the Senate approves the Atlantic Treaty.</p>
<p>Knowland also stated that he would request Lieutenant General Wedemeyer to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee, as Chennault testified before the oversight committee on the 4th.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator McClellan, chairman of the "Oversight Committee," said he was very satisfied with Chennault's testimony and that public opinion would pressure Congress to pass his aid to China bill.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that his committee was busy listening to the Atlantic Treaty and had no time to take action on Senator Knowland's request for a full investigation into U.S. policy toward China.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li Takes Advantage of the Rest Period to Carefully Consider the Current Situation; Will Go to Guangzhou to Preside Over Major Plans Upon Making a Decision</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 4th] Acting President Li returned to Guilin from Nanjing on April 23, and it has been nearly ten days since then. According to the spokesman of the Presidential Office, Acting President Li has been overworked in the past few months and needs to rest for a while before going to Guangzhou. However, the situation is so precarious that various parties have speculated about his delay, and the central and local party, government, and military leaders in Guangzhou are particularly anxious. In addition to repeatedly calling for him to go to Guangzhou to preside over national affairs, they also sent representatives to earnestly welcome him. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited a certain authoritative person close to the acting president, who told him that Acting President Li's leadership of the country this time is aimed at seeking peace and reforming politics. In order to realize peace, he has tried his best with the highest sincerity and the greatest effort, so despite being criticized by the party and outsiders and ridiculed by the CCP, he still persisted in his original intention and continued to carry out his work. Unexpectedly, the CCP put forward the "Domestic Peace Agreement," the terms of which are so harsh that they are tantamount to forcing us to surrender unconditionally, which is unacceptable to our government and the military and civilians of the whole country. Acting President Li telegraphed the CCP again, asking them to reconsider, but the CCP brazenly ignored it and used force, causing our compatriots who have been living in dire straits for a long time to suffer the misery of war. Acting President Li is deeply saddened. As for reforming politics, it has been a pity that nothing has been achieved in the past three months due to the situation. At present, the situation is becoming more and more serious, and Acting President Li is even more convinced that without thorough reform and hard work, it is impossible to inspire people's hearts, unite the forces of democracy and progress, and jointly seek salvation. Therefore, during the period of resting in Guilin, he is making a comprehensive and careful consideration of the current situation and is exchanging opinions with military and political officials in Guangzhou at any time. Finally, the authoritative person also stated that Acting President Li will go to Guangzhou to preside over major plans after the above considerations have been decided.</p>
<h3>The Control Yuan Passed a Temporary Motion to Telegraph Acting President Li to Urge Him to Go; Also Revised and Approved the Main Points of Future Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th] The Control Yuan meeting passed a temporary motion this afternoon to telegraph Acting President Li to urge him to come to Guangzhou as soon as possible to preside over major plans. The telegram will be drafted by the secretariat and sent out immediately. The 50th meeting of the Control Yuan continued to be held this morning at the Provincial Audit Office. Chairman Yu Youren first discussed the proposal on the Yuan's future work submitted by Qiu Niantai and revised by the Tang Honglie and other five-person groups. The debate lasted for two hours, and finally the main points of future work were revised and approved as follows: (1) Promote unity among all parties, concentrate the strength of the whole country, earnestly take responsibility, and reorganize the revolutionary array. (2) Urge the government to implement comprehensive reforms and assist its reform measures. Strengthen the work of the Yuan, rectify the political atmosphere, stabilize the economy, inspire morale, and inspire people's hearts. The specific implementation methods for the above work will be decided by the committees after research and sealing. The proposal submitted by Qiu Niantai, Li Tingjun, Chen Fangxian, and others that Guangzhou postal and telecommunications fees, following railway and highway transportation fees in Hunan, Hubei, and other places, should be changed to silver yuan and the fee value should be increased, and should be corrected separately, was decided to be submitted to the Finance and Food Administration Committee for review. The three committee members Qiu, Li, and Chen also proposed to designate Taiwan Province as a resettlement area for the families of Yuan personnel and prepare for relocation and resettlement as soon as possible. After the proposal was explained, voices of opposition arose. President Yu was the first to say that the Control Yuan must not set this bad precedent. He said, "If all agencies are like this, the government will collapse"! Tang Honglie, Li Zhengle, Zhang Dinghua, and others all spoke against it. Tang Honglie said, "The Taipei Central Daily News has already published articles scolding the "political garbage" who moved to Taiwan. Do we also want to squeeze into the garbage dump"! Amid a chorus of opposition, the proposal was finally rejected.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Curb the Soaring Public Utility Index</h3>
<p>The pricing index for public utilities has soared in recent days, reaching 1.25 million times on the 5th. Although Mayor Chen is just taking office and has many things to deal with, in view of the excessive charges for public utilities, which greatly affect the livelihood of the city's 6 million citizens, he reduced it to 890,000 times. Mayor Chen's concern for the people's livelihood is certainly admirable; however, the reduction to 890,000 times is still unaffordable for the general public, because the salary index for public and education personnel is only 100,000 times, and even the cost of living index for employees of general factories and companies is only 370,000 times, how can they afford 890,000 times for public utilities! In today's stormy weather, everyone should embrace the spirit of "riding out the storm together," and work together with one heart and one mind to overcome the crisis; by no means should there be a mentality of "taking advantage of the fire," especially since public utilities are closely related to the people's livelihood, and their charges should take into account the ability of citizens to pay. Moreover, in the past few days, because of the stability of the situation and the slight peace of mind of the people, general prices have rebounded, and only public utilities have risen alone. The index on May 3 was only 790,000 times, and on the 4th it soared to 1.25 million times. Regardless of the calculation standard, this unreasonable rise is obvious at a glance.</p>
<p>The issue of public utility charges has always been one of the most difficult things in Shanghai's municipal administration. In early March, the public utility authorities came up with a whimsical idea to use the "customs gold unit" as the unit of calculation, so that the price of public utilities could rise every day, only caring about their own interests and disregarding the livelihood of the general public; this absurd "automatic adjustment formula" was first criticized by the media, and the Municipal Council, representing public opinion, was also extremely angry and unanimously expressed opposition. This method of "only knowing interests and disregarding the people's livelihood" was finally forced to be abandoned, and a new method of pricing based on the cost of living index was adopted. However, in less than two months, various public utilities shouted "unaffordable" and threatened to "lose too much money and cannot maintain it." The Municipal Council had no choice but to allow the various public utilities to change to a method of adjusting prices daily based on the price index. However, fearing that the various public utilities would ask for exorbitant prices, it decided on two measures: (1) Please the municipal government to handle the matter at its discretion within the principle of maintaining the continuous supply of public utilities and taking into account the ability of citizens to pay; (2) Conduct a trial run for one month first.</p>
<p>The trial run started on April 25, and all public utilities such as water, electricity, telephone, tram, and public bus were charged at the index of 140,000 times on the 25th. On the 29th, it was changed to 157,000 times. Based on the price situation at that time, 140,000 to 150,000 times was considered fair and reasonable, and the general public praised the public utility bureau for handling it properly. However, in less than a few days, the public utility index became a hit, reaching 590,000 times on May 2, 790,000 times on the 3rd, and 1.25 million times on the 4th. Within ten days, it rose nine times, exceeding any price. The public utility bureau will explain to the citizens how the index is calculated. I wonder what they will say? The unreasonableness of the rise is obvious at a glance, why bother deceiving yourself and others!</p>
<p>We don't need to talk in high-sounding terms. Even with the facts, we can see that the price increase of public utilities is too excessive. For example, the price of trams and public buses was adjusted on May 3, and the index on which it was based was 750,000 times. The tram fare starts from 80,000 yuan and ends at 190,000 yuan; the public bus fare starts from 80,000 yuan and ends at 220,000 yuan. Two people go out and share a pedicab, and the fare they pay is even lower than taking a tram or public bus. Is the purpose of public utilities to serve or to make money? On the day of the May 3 adjustment, we witnessed many passengers being forced to get off because they did not have enough money in their pockets. If it is calculated at 1.25 million times today, then the general public, especially the salaried class, will sigh at the sight of trams and public buses, and those who can afford to ride trams or public buses will be regarded as rich customers by the general public. Is there anything more absurd in the world!</p>
<p>Also, from May 3 to 4, prices in Shanghai fell across the board. Gold and banknotes fell by 30%, and other commodities also fell accordingly. Even rice, oil, coal, and firewood were relatively stable. How could it rise from 790,000 times to 1.25 million times overnight? The public utilities' disregard for the livelihood of the citizens is obvious, and there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>In this turbulent period, defending Greater Shanghai and stabilizing the people's livelihood is the top priority, and public utilities are related to the livelihood of every citizen. We must not allow them to soar and charge without standards, making every citizen feel threatened in their life. We ask Mayor Chen to stop the soaring index of public utilities at any time. It is best to end this temporary one-month trial run early and restore a reasonable method of calculation based on the cost of living index. The Public Utility Bureau has the responsibility to supervise and manage public utilities, and Mayor Chen should order the Public Utility Bureau to assume the responsibility of reasonably adjusting the prices of public utilities.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Agrees to the Western Proposal; The Berlin Blockade Will Be Lifted on the 12th of This Month; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Will Be Held in Paris on the 23rd</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Washington, 4th Broadcast: According to reliable sources obtained today, the Soviet Union is willing to accept May 12 as the date for simultaneously lifting the Berlin blockade and the Western counter-blockade, and May 23 as the date for convening the four-power foreign ministers' conference, which will be held in Paris. The U.S. State Department spokesman announced on the morning of the 4th that the four-power representatives will meet in New York at 4:30 p.m. (Universal Time) to discuss the detailed steps for lifting the blockade and convening the foreign ministers' conference. Representatives from the United Kingdom and France will participate in the negotiations on lifting the blockade for the first time. The spokesman convened reporters this morning to report on the progress of the negotiations on the Berlin issue between U.S. representative Jessup and Soviet representative Malik in New York, and said that the informal negotiations had progressed to the stage where details could be considered, so he invited representatives from the United Kingdom and France to jointly participate in the negotiations.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] Diplomatic officials said on the 4th that the Berlin blockade negotiations were rapidly approaching a showdown. It is said that the fate of this major negotiation will initially depend on the Soviet Union's response to the Western proposal. The West has requested to end the talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and replace them with four-power consultations. The tense situation regarding the outcome of the talks apparently increased on the 3rd. U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Jessup, British Ambassador to the United Nations Jebb, and French Ambassador to the United Nations Chauvel were all in their offices all day waiting for the Soviet Union's response. They hope to begin discussions this week on the technical details of lifting the Soviet blockade of Berlin and the Western counter-blockade, as well as the agenda of the proposed four-power foreign ministers' conference. It is said that Malik "fully understands" the Western proposal to lift the blockade in early next week and decide on a date for convening a four-power conference in Paris two weeks later. Western officials did not deny the possibility that Jessup and Malik might hold another round of talks, but said that this meeting would only be held to arrange for Jebb and Chauvel to participate in the final stage of consultations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] The Berlin American Evening News reported that well-informed Soviet sources revealed that at the next four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German issue, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will make "amazing concessions." The Soviet military headquarters in Berlin revealed that the Soviet representative to the United Nations will return to Moscow on May 22 to report to the Kremlin. The Foreign Ministers' Conference may be convened around June 1. The newspaper said that Vyshinsky will suggest the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany, with its central institutions located in Berlin. The prerequisite for this move will be mutual recognition of the East German People's Council and the West German Parliament in Bonn. The newspaper also said that the Soviet Union is even planning to make other concessions so that the United States can abandon its plan to organize West Germany.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Military Governor in Germany, Clay, Has Resigned and His Resignation Has Been Approved; The Vacancy Will Be Filled by One Civilian Official and One Military Officer; McCloy and Clark Are the Most Likely Candidates</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 3rd] President Truman announced today that U.S. Military Governor in Germany General Clay will leave office on May 15. Clay's two senior deputies, Lieutenant General Huebner and Major General Hays, "will temporarily assume Clay's duties until a senior civilian commissioner is appointed." The President said that he had granted Clay's resignation at his "repeated request." "General Clay has completed a difficult administrative task. His name will be associated with one of the most difficult tasks and achievements in American history."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] After the resignation of Clay, the Governor of the U.S. Military Government in Germany and Commander of the U.S. Army, his vacancy will be filled by one civilian official and one military officer. On the civilian side, McCloy will handle the administration of the occupied area with the title of Commissioner; on the military side, a military officer will command the U.S. Army in Europe and Germany, with General Clark or Lieutenant General Wedemeyer being the most likely candidates.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman is urging International Bank Chairman McCloy to succeed Clay as the head of the U.S. military occupation zone in Germany. McCloy, who previously served as an Assistant Secretary of War, will be the first high-ranking civilian official in Germany if he takes on the new position. The conversion of the military government to a civilian government was agreed upon last month in Washington by the United States, Britain, and France, and is also related to the plan to merge the three occupied zones of West Germany. McCloy will also serve as a member of the Allied High Commission, which will be responsible for supervising the organization and development of the future new West German state.</p>
<h3>German Communist Leader Goes to Moscow</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 3rd] Germans said on the 13th that German Communist leader Pieck had gone to Moscow to discuss the German situation with the Soviet Central Politburo. Pieck and Grotewohl are both chairmen of the German Socialist Unity Party, which was formed by the merger of the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party. Grotewohl was the leader of the Social Democratic Party before the merger. In view of the progress of the negotiations between the East and West on lifting the Berlin blockade, Pieck's visit to Moscow is particularly important at this time. If the New York talks are successful, the entire policy of the German Communist Party may be re-determined.</p>
<h3>Dewey Visits Western Europe, Claims No Political Mission</h3>

<h3>U.S. Chief of Staff Urges Approval of the Atlantic Treaty</h3>
<p>Appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Testify</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] U.S. Army Chief of Staff Bradley appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is reviewing the Atlantic Treaty, today and emphasized that the first line of defense for the United States is in the heart of Europe. He said that Americans know that American money or weapons themselves cannot give Europe security. Western Europe must save itself. In the last war, in the first ten days of the Normandy landings, the U.S. military suffered 21,000 casualties. It is hoped that there will be no more such risky military operations in the future. The way to avoid it is to give the Western European armies adequate equipment and training so that they are constantly in a state of preparedness. It is believed that after obtaining the guarantee of assistance and the tools of resistance, Western Europe will be able to resist any threat of aggression. Bradley also pointed out that the eleven countries of the Atlantic Treaty have a population of over 300 million, and their natural resources and manufacturing capabilities for weapons are extremely rich and superior, which will make a very significant contribution to Western security.</p>
<h3>Canada Submits Instrument of Ratification of the Treaty</h3>

<h3>European Recovery Program Has Produced Results</h3>
<p>Acheson Delivers Speech</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 3rd] U.S. Secretary of State Acheson stated today in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that forces of freedom and democracy can be encouraged by recent developments in Western Europe. Since the promotion of the European Recovery Program, totalitarian forces in Western Europe have been unable to make further progress. In every important election in Western Europe, the people have clearly expressed their support for constitutional government. Especially in France and Italy, the Communist Party's attempts to obstruct recovery have been defeated by strong government action. Workers have gradually recognized the threat of Communist revolts. Due to the increasing belief of the people in the future, production has increased accordingly, and finance has tended towards stability. Acheson continued, stating that to maintain the momentum of economic recovery, the Atlantic Pact must be supplemented by a military aid program to provide security for stable forces. The momentum of economic recovery stimulated by U.S. aid has been disturbed by the threat of armed aggression. The North Atlantic Treaty can reduce this anxiety, allowing the people of Western Europe to devote their full efforts to the cause of recovery.</p>

<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Again Appeals to U.S. Not to Ignore Asian Situation Communist Forces Penetrating Deeply Will Be Impossible to Resist</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 3rd] Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated on the 3rd that the U.S.-Soviet talks to lift the Berlin blockade are progressing very satisfactorily. He issued this statement after a secret meeting between the Foreign Relations Committee and UN General Assembly President, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt. Evatt has been in close contact with Jessup and Malik regarding their talks. Connally told reporters that the Jessup-Malik talks were "full of harmony" and expressed Evatt's great hope for reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>Evatt took this opportunity to warn the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. should not overemphasize the European situation, expressing his concern about the Communist progress in the Far East. The penetration of Communist forces has expanded to India, Burma, and other regions of the Pacific. He stated that the Communist progress in China is at least partly due to the U.S.'s neglect of Asia. The true purpose of Evatt's consultation with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not been revealed, as, according to tradition, the Senate's main committees have never listened to the testimony of any foreigners. When Evatt was asked what was discussed in the meeting, he replied that the meeting was merely an "exchange of views between old friends," and he will meet with President Truman on the 4th. Regarding the situation in the Pacific, Evatt expressed deep concern that the U.S.'s neglect of Asia has led to the feeling that the U.S. does not care about Asia and that the progress of Soviet-backed Communist forces will be irresistible. It is reported that Evatt also stated that Australia is concerned about the revival of Japanese military power but supports the economic reconstruction of Japan.</p>
<h3>Ingrid Bergman's Romantic Chapter Falls in Love With Director, Wants to Divorce Husband</h3>
<p>[Reuters Rome, 3rd] Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman, who is filming on the volcanic island of Stromboli in Italy, is rumored to have fallen in love with the film's Italian director, Rossellini. Her husband, brain surgeon Dr. Lindstrom, has flown to the island from Los Angeles in response to his wife's urgent telegram. It is rumored that Lindstrom has agreed to return to the United States immediately to proceed with divorce proceedings. According to close friends of Italian director Rossellini, Ingrid Bergman has agreed to marry Rossellini, but Rossellini must first divorce his wife before marrying Ingrid. Italian movie fans greatly admire Ingrid's past serious life, which is unlike that of other Hollywood actors. After this affair, there have been many criticisms from Italians, and even the left-wing Republican newspaper asked Ingrid, "How can it be, Ingrid, that you would do this too?"</p>
<h3>Full Text of Agreements Between Chinese Communists, Burmese Communists, and North Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Yangon, April 24th Dispatch] The Chinese Communists launched a war of chaos in the country, actually seeking to communize China and make it a vassal of the Soviet Union. The historical facts of the past two decades fully prove this. However, a small number of intellectuals and democratic countries, such as Britain and the United States, were deceived by the false propaganda of the Communist Party and its fellow travelers, mistakenly believing that the Chinese Communists were nationalists or a rural political faction and had no connection with the Soviet Union or world communism. It was not until Mao Zedong's worldwide broadcast on April 4th, attacking the North Atlantic Treaty and declaring that he would lead China to fight for the Soviet Union, that the true face of the Chinese Communists was revealed to the world. Furthermore, observing the recent agreements signed between the Chinese Communists and the Burmese Communist Party and the North Korean government, it is even clearer that the Chinese Communists intend to conquer Asia and launch a global anti-democracy and anti-freedom struggle. The content of the two agreements is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) On February 25th, the Chinese Communists secretly sent Zhang Huihua, Chen Jiakang, and Du Shuhua as representatives to sign a mutual assistance agreement with the Burmese Communists in Pingman, Burma. The terms are as follows: (1) Both parties firmly engage in the task of liberating Southeast Asia. The strategies and tactics of action steps must be coordinated. (2) Exchange intelligence on strategic actions against Anglo-American imperialism. (3) Anti-imperialist actions in Southeast Asia must take international resolutions as their target. (4) If necessary, the Chinese Communists will use military force to directly support the Burmese Communists on the Sino-Burmese border and further serve as an outpost. (5) The All-Burma Federation of Labor, the All-Burma People's Democratic Youth League, and the All-Burma Student Union shall make contact with local Chinese Communist organizations.</p>
<p>(B) The representative of the North Korean People's Democratic Government, Zhu Xianyong, and the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, Lin Feng, signed a supplementary mutual assistance agreement in Moscow on March 17th. The content is as follows: (1) The signatories shall, on the basis of mutual assistance and equality, jointly resist any aggressive forces. (2) If one of the signatories is attacked by any imperialist, it shall be considered an attack on the entire population of both parties and shall immediately cooperate, act jointly, and fight side by side. (3) The Chinese Communist Party shall exert all its efforts to support the North Korean people in striving for Korean independence, unification, and peaceful democratic development. (4) Between July 1, 1949, and August 30, 1950, the Chinese Communist Party shall fully support North Korea with Northeast military supplies, materials, and personnel. (5) Existing Japanese technical personnel and Japanese military supplies in the Northeast region shall be given priority for use by North Korea. (6) Exchange materials with each other according to the needs of the economic development of the two peoples. (7) To enhance the external trade links between the two parties, a chain should be formed for expansion. (8) In the struggle for peace and cooperation in the Far East and the world, both parties shall support all efforts to protect the Soviet Union's security and peaceful policies and defend against the conspiracies and offensives of imperialism.</p>
<h3>New Uranium Mine Discovered in the United States</h3>

<h3>The British Labour Party</h3>
<p>— Written by Brailsford, Translated by Song Guihuang</p>
<p>In 1924, on a memorable evening, I had a conversation with a taxi driver in London. That day was the day that MacDonald organized the first Labour cabinet. The driver was not very concerned about his fare but was excitedly discussing the national affairs of the time with me. As he talked about the new Prime Minister, his eyes shone, as if I could still see it today. He said, "He is one of our team. He was born in an iron factory." Today, the Labour Party has become a recognized institution, but among manual workers, there is still a legend about it. This legend is still fresh and interesting, sufficient for conversation, and embodies the hopes of the workers.</p>
<p>Only because of the Labour Party did the workers first have the opportunity to exert their power on the course of national destiny. Today, children born in working-class families no longer need to be like their grandfathers, feeling "inferior" innately. Today, they are no longer the obedient servants of the hereditary ruling class.</p>
<p>The Pioneer Era</p>
<p>The expansion of the power base like this has happened twice in British history. The liberation of the middle class took two hundred years, from the time of the Civil War to the first Reform Act. The laboring class obtaining its political equal status took one hundred years. First, Robert Owen led the "Grand National Consolidated Trades Union" to engage in fervent struggles in 1834. By 1945, the Labour Party matured by forming the first cabinet with a majority of Labour Party members, and thus the final goal was achieved. The first half-century was the era of pioneers, the era of Owenites, Chartists, Morris, Hyndman, etc. The actual record of the Labour Party only began in 1899, when Keir Hardie persuaded the "Trade Union Congress" to establish the "Labour Representation Committee." The Labour Party emerged from this committee in 1906.</p>
<p>Like any other political party, the Labour Party's origins are two-pronged. On the one hand, it seeks to benefit a particular social class, namely the workers, and on the other hand, it pursues the realization of an idea, namely the realization of socialism. This concept of a labour alliance is unique to Britain. There is no such situation in any other country. On the European continent, members of the Socialist Party join as individuals. Only in Britain do workers join the Labour Party through their trade unions, and after nearly a century of struggle, workers have remained loyal to their unions. Owen also adopted this policy when he first launched the labor movement.</p>
<p>The Fabians are also a part of the socialists in the British labour alliance. They are a small group, consisting of middle-class intellectuals, led by thinkers such as Webb, Shaw, and Wells, who exerted a decisive influence. However, what largely made the trade unions embrace the idea of independent political action was the "Independent Labour Party" founded by Hardie in 1893. Hardie was originally a miner who, having endured the pain of hunger, cold, and unemployment in his youth, deeply knew how to care for workers and share their joys and sorrows. His main task was to persuade the elders not to rely on the Liberal Party, which still believed in "laissez-faire policies." At first, he pointed out that the interests of the workers could not be hoped for from a party that was controlled and subsidized by their employers. Then he preached the warm, idealistic, and socialist gospel, with particular emphasis on ethics and morality. His doctrine is a doctrine of democracy. He does not resort to revolutionary rhetoric.</p>
<p>The "Labour Representation Committee" initially adopted a neutral policy. At that time, it had no funds, and only a quarter of the members of the national trade unions initially participated in it. The essence of the Labour Party lies in the two legal resolutions that regulate the basis of the activities of the trade unions. In 1900, the "National Union of Railwaymen" was ordered to compensate the Taff Vale Railway Company for the losses suffered due to the strike. This was tantamount to disarming every trade union. The workers had lost the effective use of their only weapon in the industrial struggle—the right of solidarity.</p>
<p>At the same time, in 1903, some trade unions levied fees from their members to fund election campaigns. Therefore, in 1906, the Labour Party occupied seats in the House of Commons for the first time in its name, with 29 seats, and Hardie served as Chairman. The second challenge came with the Osborne Judgment in 1909. The judgment declared levying campaign activity fees illegal and stipulated that all political activities of trade unions were heinous crimes. It was in this year that the miners, who had always been staunch Liberal Party members, joined the Labour Party. In 1910, the Labour Party had 40 members in the House of Commons, thus defeating the Liberal government. Partly due to pressure and partly due to being able to appeal to a sense of justice, it finally won the reversal of the Liberal Party and had the Taff Vale and Osborne Judgments overturned. By this point, the labouring masses had realized that the Labour Party was indispensable, just to protect their industrial interests. Hardie believed that the socialist workers of Europe only needed to threaten a general strike to prevent war. But by 1914, with the demise of this fantasy, he became discouraged.

<h3>U.S. Plans to Recognize Legitimate Interests in Vietnamese and Indonesian National Movements Arms Supply to French Army Seems to Be Confirmed</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 3rd] A State Department spokesman, in responding to newspaper reports that the U.S. plans to supply arms to the French army in Vietnam, stated that if the "legitimate interests" of nationalist elements in Vietnam and Indonesia are realized, the possibility of the expansion of communism in Southeast Asia can certainly be reduced. While the spokesman did not directly comment on the issue of supplying arms to the French army, he stated, "There is no need to reiterate the position that the U.S. government has repeatedly stated before, that the U.S. is extremely hopeful that France and the Netherlands can peacefully resolve their differences with the Vietnamese and Indonesians. The U.S.'s interest in this matter has not diminished at all." The spokesman also said that he was not aware of the rumor that a Southeast Asian anti-communist defense conference will be convened as soon as France and the Netherlands resolve their difficulties in Southeast Asia. According to the report, participants in the Southeast Asian anti-communist defense conference will include the United States, Britain, France, India, Thailand, Burma, Vietnam, and Indonesia.</p>

He Zeng successfully put the ball in the basket from the crowd, making it four to five. The two sides fiercely competed, leading to numerous fouls. Fu Shan and Cheng Zhang worked together, while He Zeng and Bo Wen put up a strong defense. Cheng Zhang's shot caused the Shanghai Police to call their first timeout. Hua Lian's attacks flowed smoothly, while the Shanghai Police suffered setbacks, failing to improve their score. The Shanghai Police made substitutions, bringing in Liang Rong Biao and Fu Qi Xia, replacing He Jin Gui and Wang Bo Wen. Hua Lian also called a timeout. Hua Lian adopted a delaying tactic, while the Shanghai Police advanced cautiously. Zhen Zhong made two successful shots with his long arms, and Jin Sheng substituted for Li Zhen Zhong. At the same time, He Jin Gui of the Shanghai Police returned to the fray, replacing Fu Qi Xia. Rong Sheng scored from under the basket, and Jia Zhou immediately responded. Rong Biao seized an opportunity to score, making it 13 to 23. Hua Lian called another timeout. Fu Shan scored, and Song Yuan also scored.

Song Yuan scored with a one-handed shot. Hua Lian paused its attacks midway, conserving energy. He Zeng and Bo Wen each scored four points. The fighting in front of both teams' benches was intense and exciting. Rong Sheng was dismissed after committing his fifth foul, and Qi Xia replaced Cheng Zhang.

<p>Order for Today's Two Women's Round Robin Finals</p>
<p>To ensure an early conclusion to the fourth Mayor's Cup basketball tournament, three matches are scheduled for today, starting at 5:00 PM. The women's round robin finals will take up two of those slots, with the Green Team facing the Li Team and the Ya Team challenging the Ying Team. The other match will be a men's consolation bracket semi-final between Dong Hua and the Pu Team to determine who will advance. All matches will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets are 200,000 yuan upstairs, 400,000 yuan downstairs, and 800,000 yuan for reserved seats. The schedule and referee list are as follows:</p>
<p>Li Team vs. Ying Team (Women's Round Robin) 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Green Team vs. Ya Team (Women's Round Robin) 5:45 PM</p>
<p>Dong Hua vs. Pu Team (Men's Consolation Bracket Semi-Final) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>In the first women's round robin final, the Li Team will meet the Ying Team. The former is the runner-up in this year's league, with agile and skilled young players. However, their smaller stature may put them at a disadvantage under men's rules. In their first match against the Ya Team, they only managed to win in overtime. Led by Wang Shan, the Ying Team boasts talents such as Yang Shu Jun, Huang Pin Zhen, and Wang Can Hua, who are full of energy. They posed a significant threat to the league champions, the Green Team, in their previous encounter, losing by only seven points. Their match against the Li Team today is expected to be evenly matched, making the outcome uncertain.</p>
<p>In the other women's final, the Green Team will face the Ya Team. The Ya Team's roster includes famous players such as Sun Feng Zhu, Zhu Min, Qian Meng Yue, and Zhu Lan Zhen. Newcomer Wang Ze Lun's performance is especially promising. After losing to the Li Team, they have been reinvigorated and are determined to restore their reputation. Tonight, they face another formidable opponent, and a cautious approach should lead to outstanding results. The Green Team is one of the best women's basketball teams in the city. Their lineup includes outstanding talents such as Ming Yuan, Zong, Jin Yun, and Zhen Man Li, who are sharp on offense and strong on defense. They are invincible, and the Ya Team will likely find it difficult to escape their fate.</p>
<h3>Three Group B Table Tennis League Matches This Evening</h3>

<h3>Unprecedented Fire on Kai Xuan Road: 20,000 People Displaced, Over 3,000 Homes Destroyed Including Factories, Western-Style Houses, and Shantytowns</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The shantytowns along Kai Xuan Road and Chang Ning Road intersection (i.e., West Xin Street) in Western Shanghai, numbered more than several thousand households. Unexpectedly, at approximately 2 PM yesterday, a fire broke out in a shanty home in the 16th Bao due to a cooking mishap. Flames immediately engulfed the area, quickly spreading to all the shantytowns south of Chang Ning Road, dozens of small factories, and municipal houses, including the China Chemical Factory and the Qi Xin Rubber Factory, which were almost completely destroyed. Simultaneously, the fire spread to the shops along the street north of the road, also affecting the Yuan Yuan Rubber Factory and two large Western-style houses in Su Jia Jiao behind it. At this point, the fire intensified, and dozens of small industrial factories nearby, including tanneries, leather factories, enamel factories, wire nail factories, and chemical factories, were all burned down. Subsequently, the fire spread along Chang Ning Road into the Hua Yuan Fang neighborhood, destroying seven Western-style houses, numbers 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. Upon receiving the report, the Fire Department, led by Chief Zhou and Chief Ye, rushed to the scene with reinforcements from the General Brigade. Units from Song Shan, Xin Kai He, Jing An Temple, Yi Chang Road, Xin Zha, Shen Jia Wan, and Wu Xing Road also arrived successively, along with civilian fire brigades. In addition to all the brigades from the North and South cities, the Fa Hua and Zhen Ru fire brigades also rushed to assist. However, the area lacked hydrant water sources, making connections difficult. They even resorted to relaying water from the Zhong Shan Park pond. Despite the efforts of the firefighters, their effectiveness was limited due to the time and effort required. Moreover, the factories contained flammable materials such as rubber and chemical raw materials, which, once ignited, made the situation even more uncontrollable. After the fire broke out, Liu Yao Chen, the Deputy Chief of the Fa Cao Police Precinct in charge, along with Section Chief Lu Xiu Duan, Inspector Zhu Yun Zhang, patrol officers, uniformed police, and all the volunteer police, arrived at the scene to maintain order. After 4 PM, reporters drove to the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Jiang Su Road and saw that the road was blocked by onlookers, and vehicles traveling west were all turning back. Dozens of fire trucks lined up west of Zhong Shan Park, resembling a long snake formation, and the road was flooded with water above the ankles. Upon arriving at the scene, under the guidance of Chief Ye and Section Chief Lu, they inspected the surrounding area. Embers were still smoldering on both sides of the road, making it feel like being in a furnace, which was truly unbearable. Upon reaching the origin of the fire, they saw a charred body lying on the side of the road, resembling a burnt log, a truly tragic sight. In the distance, several Western-style houses in Hua Yuan Fang were engulfed in flames, and firefighters were working diligently. During the height of the fire, several firefighters were injured, including Qu Shang Wen, the Deputy Squad Leader of the Xin Zha Road Unit, a police officer from 69 Yi Chang Road, and officers Tao Yong Fu and Chen Dun Ran, who were injured in falls and being crushed. All were taken to the Police Hospital for treatment. The fire was extinguished around 6 PM. It is reported that the fire area was approximately 200,000 square meters, affecting over 3,000 homes in three "bao", leaving approximately 20,000 people displaced. Along the roads, boxes and blankets were piled up like mountains. The extent of the losses cannot be estimated at this time. As far as is known, there were two deaths and more than ten injuries. Afterwards, Mayor Chen Liang, Police Chief Mao Sen, and Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Chen Bao Tai, concerned about the affected victims, arrived at the scene one after another to discuss disaster relief. The Mayor ordered that the victims be temporarily housed in nearby schools and community organizations. Meanwhile, appeals for relief will be launched to all sectors of society by various charitable organizations, and it is hoped that philanthropists in Shanghai will actively contribute. According to Chief Ye, the fire was the worst conflagration in recent decades. Over 500 people participated in the rescue effort. Two pump trucks were burned, and many water hoses were damaged. He also stated that the fire was caused by the difficulty of obtaining water. It is reported that the arsonist is on the run, and the police precinct in charge is investigating.</p>
<h3>Mayor Chen's Broadcast Regarding the Fire in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Mayor Chen broadcasted at 10:30 PM last night on Shanghai Radio regarding the fire in Western Shanghai, stating in brief: At 2:05 PM today, a fire broke out in Su Jia Jiao, West Xin Street, Fa Cao District of this city. More than 3,200 homes were affected, displacing more than 15,000 victims. I, along with the Police, Social Affairs, and Civil Affairs Bureau Chiefs, the Chief of the Municipal Party Committee, and the city's fire brigades, arrived at the scene in a timely manner to carry out rescue work. The fire was extinguished at 6:15 PM. The scene of the victims crying out to heaven was truly heartbreaking. In addition to setting up the Fa Cao District Fire Relief Association in the Hui Er Kang Hotel to handle the aftermath, I ordered the purchase of bread and instructed the Relief Committee to immediately dispatch soup trucks to distribute porridge. I also ordered the concentrated effort of the area's "da bing" shops to quickly make "da bing" and distribute them in groups. All police officers were prepared to work through the night, and I also ordered the District Office and 500 volunteer police to assist, along with the military police, to maintain order in a well-organized manner. Meanwhile, I discussed with nearby schools, factories, and public places to open them all up as temporary shelters, and I also encouraged wealthy families nearby to try their best to accommodate victims. I am deeply saddened and sympathetic to this unfortunate event. I have already launched temporary relief efforts for the affected households, which can be comforting to the citizens. At the same time, I express my deep admiration for the service spirit of all the firefighters, the students of various universities, and the political workers, as well as the colleagues of the military police and the Second Corps.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Commemorate Youth Day, Fang Zhi Delivers Inspirational Speech</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] To commemorate the "May Fourth" Youth Day, the city's youth sector held a commemorative meeting at the Shanghai Club at 9:00 AM yesterday. Over 300 representatives from all sectors and youth students attended. Zhang Dan Qiu served as chairman, reporting on the significance of the commemoration and calling on youth from all sectors to actively participate in this anti-communist self-defense war, studying to become the new army against the Red Imperialism, the violent ruling group, and the Communist bandits. Then, Fang Zhi, Director of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a speech, stating in brief: "When we commemorate the 'May Fourth', we must use the consistent spirit of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism to save the nation and the country. We must not hesitate to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the Communist bandits. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country, and there is no shortage of young patriots who sacrifice themselves for the nation and the country. I hope that we can unite and strengthen ourselves to participate in this self-defense war to save the country and educate the people. Shanghai has elite naval, land, and air forces, and solid defensive fortifications. If the Communist bandits dare to invade, we will give them a head-on blow. However, I hope that all youth in the city must demonstrate the glorious spirit of the 'May Fourth' Movement, cooperate with all military actions, go to the suburbs and urban areas to conduct propaganda to comfort the national army, eliminate spies, and rescue the wounded and sick," and so on. Finally, the meeting passed a telegram to acting President Li, urging him to go to Guangzhou to preside over the major military affairs of the country, as well as a telegram to youth across the country.</p>

The plan is roughly as follows: The government will implement special rice rationing for employees, specifically purchasing from various manufacturers at a fixed price, and distributing it to employees based on a standard of four "dou" of rice per person, which will be deducted from the employee's wages. If the translated amount of the employee's wages is less than four "dou", the employer will subsidize the difference. If it exceeds four "dou", the employer will issue banknotes, silver dollars, or other goods for the excess amount.</p>
<h3>Over 8,000 Tons of U.S. Aid Rice Transported from Siam by Hai Xuan Ship</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] U.S. aid rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Xuan ship has departed from Bangkok with 8,956 tons of U.S. aid rice.

<h3>Silver Dollar Trading Registration: Review and Issuance of Permits Begin Today, 15,000 Application Forms Issued</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau is handling the registration of silver dollar trading applications. Yesterday, being the last day, more people went to register, and more than 10,000 people queued up to wait. The office entrance and stairs were filled with applying merchants, making it impossible for the Bureau's staff to enter and exit. Yesterday, they made a great effort to supply forms, issuing 6,000 application forms in the morning and 4,000 application forms in the afternoon, totaling 10,000 forms. Together with the previous 5,000 forms, a total of 15,000 forms were issued. They ran out of forms at approximately 4:00 PM, and the order was quite good. To show restriction, the Bureau will close registration today and begin organizing the review. It is estimated that an average of approximately 2,000 permits can be approved and issued each day, and it is expected that the review and issuance will be completed by the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>National Banks Assist in Recovering Old-Style Bank Notes</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the authorities set a deadline for the recovery of old-style bank notes, representatives of the silver, money, and trust industries in this city, including Chen Duo Ru and Shen Ri Xin, requested that national banks should, according to the daily deposits of each bank, allocate cash and fixed-amount bank notes as much as possible. They specifically visited Director Bi of the Monetary Management Bureau and Director Lin of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank to discuss this. It is reported that the authorities have agreed to relieve the various difficulties caused to the banks by the inability to issue bank notes as much as possible. At the same time, they also requested the banks to complete two points: (1) Starting from the 5th of this month, within three days, the total amount of bank notes recovered by each bank should be reported to the Monetary Management Bureau in a list. (2) Within three days, the total amount of bank notes not yet recovered by each bank should also be reported to the Monetary Management Bureau in a list, and the full amount of reserves for these unrecovered bank notes should be deposited with the Central Bank. Therefore, bank notes that have not been cashed with the banks after three days should be taken to the Central Bank for cashing. It is reported that this measure is to prevent banks from acting cleverly after the deadline.</p>

<h3>Minister Hang to Fly to Guangzhou Today: Conversation with University Presidents Yesterday, Encouraging Colleagues in the Education Sector to Work Hard</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education is scheduled to fly to Guangzhou by plane this morning. Those accompanying him include Hu Jia Jian, Director of the Department of Secondary Education, Ban Zhen Zhong, Assistant of the General Affairs Department, and Commissioner Yu Shan He. In the future, official documents from the Ministry of Education will be forwarded by the Ministry of Education's Shanghai Office, and education funding matters will be handled in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Minister Hang also hosted a conversation with presidents of universities and colleges in the city at the Mechanical Vocational School at 10:00 AM yesterday. Mayor Chen, Deputy Commander Ding, and Political Committee Member Fang were also invited to participate. In addition to discussing general issues, Minister Hang made the following remarks: During this short stay in Shanghai, I have been very comforted by the steady spirit of the education sector in Shanghai. I am temporarily leaving, but I firmly believe that Shanghai can endure, and I believe that Shanghai will eventually be an important base for a free China. We definitely need this spirit of endurance. Mr. Hu Shi said: "Endure and wait for change." I would like to change the word "wait" to "respond": "Endure and respond to change." We especially need to use self-reliance to bring about external change. Some people ask me what the future holds. I see that the present is certainly difficult, and the future will certainly be even more difficult, but I believe that there will eventually be a day of light. We have confidence, and we need a consistent determination. We don't necessarily need specific and detailed plans, but we have sweat and blood. I hope that our colleagues in the education sector will take on the responsibility of leadership, expressing their thoughts through words and replacing silence with action, and working hard to strive for and protect academic freedom.</p>
<h3>Third Phase of Rice Rationing Ends Today, This Month's Ration Coupons to Be Issued by the 8th</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the Population Investigation Office, the third phase of rice rationing for April ends today (the 5th). Ration coupons for May are limited to issuance by the 8th of this month. Citizens who are eligible but have not received their ration coupons are requested to claim them from their respective "jia" chiefs by the 11th of this month. Late claims will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Needed by Public and Private School Staff Can Be Purchased from Petroleum Companies</h3>
<p>In the past, the China Petroleum Company supplied kerosene for the use of public and private school staff. The quantity was determined by the Municipal Government's Public and Private School Staff Material Supply Review Committee, which issued purchase certificates and notification slips. The company's Shanghai Police Affairs Office then sold the kerosene accordingly. Now that the committee has been ordered to disband, no one is in charge of issuing purchase certificates. It is learned that the company, in order to benefit the public and private school staff in the city, is still willing to continue selling the kerosene. The purchase procedures are also simpler than before. That is, all public and private school staff in the city who need kerosene can directly contact the company's Zhongshan Park and Sichuan Road Bridge South gas stations or the Shanghai Sales Office at 17 Huangpu Road to purchase it.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Pricing in Advertisements Forbidden by Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Garrison Headquarters had repeatedly ordered a strict ban on public utilities, institutions, shops and vendors using silver dollars for pricing, with violators to be prosecuted for disrupting the financial order. Recently, it sent another official letter to all newspapers reiterating the previous order and requesting them to refuse to publish advertisements priced in silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Slightly Weak, Edible Oil Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market trend showed a slight decline yesterday, due to the weakness of both gold and silver dollars, which dampened public confidence. The price of white japonica and thin indica rice in the North Market fell sharply to the 20 million mark, a decrease of 1.5 million yuan compared to yesterday. High-quality early rice was only traded at 18.5 million yuan, and other types of rice also fell by more than one million yuan. The South Market saw smaller declines, with white japonica at 20.5 million yuan and thin indica at 21.128 million yuan, each down by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Transactions of rice and grains were scattered, with some as small as three to five dan.</p>
<p>Edible oil: The authorities forbade quoting prices in silver dollars, which delayed the start of trading, which gradually opened near noon. The initial price of soybean oil was 92 million yuan, and the closing price was 88 million yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 72 million yuan, and raw rapeseed barrel oil reached 80 million yuan before closing at 76 million yuan. However, it was not specified whether these prices were in promissory notes or cash, and the prices were several million yuan higher than the previous day. Soybean cake trading did not open.</p>
<p>Flour: The market trend continued to decline, mainly due to the weakness outside the exchange, with sellers showing a strong desire to sell. However, there was a lack of chips in the market, and most buyers were taking a wait-and-see approach, so the spot market was very soft. The initial price of Lao Che flour was 5.5 million yuan, and the closing price fell to 5.2 million yuan. Bingshun flour opened at 4.7 million yuan, and then gradually weakened to close at 4.4 million yuan. The supply and demand for wheat bran were balanced, and the market trend was flat. Large bags were quoted at 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Loses Its Normal State, Stock Exchange Suspends Meetings</h3>
<p>The Securities Exchange decided to suspend market meetings starting from May 5, 1938, after convening the 14th joint meeting of the first board of directors and supervisors, due to the market trading losing its normal state and business being almost at a standstill. Yesterday's trend in the Shanghai stock market was still slightly weak. Popular and unpopular stocks still followed the old path in the market, and prices were quoted with limits. There were no transactions by noon, and off-exchange dark market trading immediately began. However, due to the weakness of all commodities and the flatness of public confidence, trading was also quite quiet. 100,000 shares of Yongsha were quoted at 140 million yuan for promissory notes for purchase and 150 million yuan for sale, but transactions were extremely rare. Dark market prices of Meyer, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Xinhe were increased by about 100 million yuan, while there was little interest in the remaining stocks. The supply was also scarce, and trading was invisibly sluggish. Except for Huafeng, Taiwan Sugar, and Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity, which were bid for at the upper limit, the rest were quiet and unheard of. The number of attendees also decreased significantly, and there were no customers at the various securities firms, making the past lively scene quite cold.</p>
<p>Gold Bonds Rise to Limit</p>
<p>The trend of gold bonds showed a purchase at the upper limit price of 1,891,200,000 yuan at the opening of the city in the morning. There were no sales at the close, and no transactions throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Sentiment is Timid, Low Prices Enter the Two Billion Range</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's gold market situation was that because the deadline for the recall of promissory notes was approaching and the bank's promissory notes could not be issued starting today, the turnover of chips failed. Coupled with the tightening of money supply, public confidence was even weaker, and the market showed a downward trend amidst a wave of selling. The spot price outside the exchange opened at 230 million and 260 million yuan in the morning, which was the highest price of the day. After opening, the price gradually declined, entering the two billion range, trading at 190 million and 210 million yuan, and once as low as 170 million and 200 million yuan. The noon closing saw a slight rebound to 200 million and 230 million yuan. Afternoon trading was sluggish, with prices falling to 190 million and 220 million yuan.</p>
<p>The US dollar off-exchange remained soft due to more supply than demand. The morning opening was at 4.5 million and 5 million, once as low as 3.8 million and 4.3 million. The noon closing was at 4 million and 4.5 million. In the afternoon, buyers were scarce, and the price fell to 3.8 million and 4.3 million, about 20% lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Cash Chips Gradually Increase, Silver Dollars Turn Higher in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar market was flat with an upward trend. Most general businesses have received their registered licenses and have resumed trading. However, the listed prices varied greatly, and the distance between buying and selling was quite inconsistent. The difference was 200,000 yuan at the low end and as much as 400,000 yuan at the high end. The number of silver dollar dealers on the street has decreased significantly, but underground trading is still very active and extremely secretive. Cash transactions of "big heads" were generally at 3.5 million and 3.8 million yuan in the morning. Promissory note transactions have decreased. Some businesses bought at 5 million and sold at 6 million, some bought at 4.5 million and sold at 5.5 million, and some only bought at 5 million and did not sell. Each business was different. In the afternoon, as the supply of cash chips increased, retail investors had a strong appetite, and the final price of "big heads" rose to 3.8 million and 4 million yuan. There were slight fluctuations in promissory note transactions. Central Bank fixed-amount promissory notes traded at 4 million and 5 million yuan. Bank promissory notes traded at 4.5 million and 5.5 million yuan. Bank promissory notes traded at 5 million and 6 million yuan, up 400,000 yuan compared to the 7th.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Retreat Together</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn: Due to the continued decline in gold prices outside the exchange and the recall of promissory notes from banks starting today, credit in the market tightened, and the trend of money supply was unanimously tightened, so public confidence was very weak, and coarse and fine yarn fell again. 42-count Blue Phoenix traded at 780 million yuan, continuing to fall by 170 million yuan. 40-count and 32-count yarn fell by more than 220 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse single yarn traded at 440 million yuan, falling by 60 million yuan. Spot goods traded at 480 million yuan, falling by 95 million yuan. All yarns below 20-count were weak.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth: Domestic trading has not yet opened. Off-exchange quotes were initially flat and then weakened. Trading became lively around 9:15 am. Selling pressure from all sides increased, and buyers were panic-stricken. Around 10:30 am, the prices of leading fine cloth and Four Gentlemen serge were about 14 million yuan. It was slightly lower than the previous day. Private manufacturers frequently sold off inventory to raise salaries and wages, and the market trend was also weak. Factory prices fluctuated, but the fluctuations were small.</p>

<h3>Public Utility Index Continues to Soar, Will Inevitably Lead to Serious Consequences, Citizens Unable to Afford, Industry and Commerce Unite in Complaint, Hoping the Authorities Will Quickly Correct It</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The pricing index for public utilities in this city has been soaring in the past week, causing great resentment among the citizens of the city. This newspaper has received dozens of letters from all walks of life providing opinions on the "public utility index" and calling for a stop to the soaring prices and questioning them every day. It is unanimously believed that the public and private school staff index is only 100,000 times, and the salary index is only 370,000 times, while yesterday's "public utility index" reached 1.25 million times (still as high as 890,000 times after Mayor Chen's reduction), and is adjusted daily, increasing every day, by tens of thousands of times at least and more than two hundred thousand times at most. The rate of increase is so rapid that it is astonishing. It is found that the public utility index was 140,000 times on April 25, 157,000 times on April 29, 194,000 times on April 30, 452,000 times on May 1, 590,000 times on May 2, 790,000 times on May 3, and 890,000 times on May 4 after the reduction. Today, it has jumped to 950,000 times, with an increase of 9 times in just ten days.</p>
<p>Expenses Payable by an Ordinary Employee</p>
<p>If an ordinary base salary is 80 yuan, multiplied by the cost of living index at the end of April, and assuming that the minimum monthly electricity consumption is 14 degrees, the average base salary is multiplied by 371,344 times. The actual salary received in April, water consumption is 19 degrees, and the settlement of payable water and electricity units is assumed to be 29,700,7520 yuan as follows:</p>
<p>Electricity: 1 to 10 degrees, base price per degree unit 0.220 = base price unit 2.20; 11 to 14 degrees, second degree base price unit 0.274 = total unit 1.70; 3.30 + surcharge 10% = 0.33 = total unit 3.63</p>
<p>Water: 19 degrees, base price per degree unit 0.279 = total unit 5.30</p>
<p>The total of the above two water and electricity items is 8.93 units. If calculated according to today's public utility index of 950,000 times, then it is necessary to pay 8,483,500 yuan in gold yuan, which accounts for 30% of their salary. The remaining 70% is only enough to maintain all other daily life? Moreover, the billing period varies from household to household, and the bills are sent out in the last ten days of the month. With the public utility index rising endlessly, how can the salary class, which relies on the salary of the salary index as income, cope with such an endless burden?</p>
<p>The Consequences of Leading the Price Increase are Worrying</p>
<p>However, people cannot live without water and fire, and they cannot find another way. At this time of tense situation, stability is the first priority. If the price increase is allowed to be endless, not only will it threaten the livelihood of the citizens, but there will be a day when they cannot afford to pay. Even factories, which rely on electricity for power, will be forced to shut down due to excessive electricity expenses, affecting the lives of millions of workers, which is even more serious. Moreover, the last time various public utility companies requested to settle prices in customs gold units, which was opposed and terminated by the Municipal Council, but the fluctuation of customs gold units is determined according to the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Recently, the fluctuations of foreign exchange certificates have not been drastic, so even if prices were settled in customs gold units at that time, the degree of increase may not be as violent as it is now. However, now that the public utility index, which is even higher than customs gold, is being used and not being stopped, how can it be said to be in line with the current situation?</p>
<p>Furthermore, recently, some unscrupulous merchants have raised the prices of their goods. If asked why the price increase is so rapid, they will definitely answer: "Learn from public utilities!" Therefore, the soaring public utility index not only leads the price increase, but also makes the current financial crisis even more chaotic. It is deeply hoped that the municipal and security authorities will take into account the difficulties of the people's livelihood and the crisis of industry in this extraordinary period and quickly remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Councilors Point Out Many Irrationalities</p>
<p>The reporter also interviewed a councilor on this matter. According to him, the soaring public utility index is unreasonable. He cited the following reasons: (1) As far as he knows, all municipal government employees can obtain "water and electricity compensation vouchers", which can be used to offset payments within certain limits. May I ask, why don't other citizens of Shanghai get this kind of preferential treatment? (2) The treatment of public utility company employees is better than that of any other organization. At this time of extraordinary conditions and the implementation of thrift, how can the blood and sweat of 5 million citizens be used to provide a few employees with excessive enjoyment? (3) Recently, the US dollar, silver dollar, and general commodity prices have fallen due to the strict control of the authorities. Why does the public utility index seem to have no fear and soar into the sky? (4) The city has entered a state of war. In order to defend Greater Shanghai and strengthen the combat power, the first priority is to maintain security. Now the city is facing a crisis of total economic collapse. If this continues, the future will be unimaginable. The reason for this is that the repeated soaring of the public utility index is the only factor. In order to solve the current crisis, he suggested: (1) Now that Speaker Pan has left Shanghai for Guangzhou, Deputy Speaker Xu should be asked to immediately convene the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Council or a full emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. (2) The military authorities should be requested to jointly take effective measures to stop the situation with Mayor Chen in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<p>Cotton Textile Association Calls for Correction</p>
<p>When the Shanghai Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Beijing held a meeting of the standing directors yesterday, it was stated that the industry uses a lot of electricity, and the electricity price index has been adjusted daily, and the rate of increase has exceeded that of general commodities by several times. Although it is said that the calculation of this index has a different standard, it has not yet been announced, which is very incomprehensible. Moreover, at this time of extraordinary circumstances, the operation of various factories has been suspended, and they are unable to pay the huge electricity bills, which are rising endlessly. It was decided to send letters to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the Municipal Industry Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, respectively, calling for a way to correct and suppress the situation. In addition, Zhu Fuyou, Han Zhiming, and Wang Zijian, three directors, were appointed to present the actual difficulties to the above-mentioned agencies and ask for remedy.</p>

<h3>"Orchid Exhibition" in Taiwan, Okinawa is a Piece of "Recovered Land"</h3>
<p>— Jing Dong</p>
<p>[Taipei, 26th] An orchid exhibition was held at the Horticultural Experiment Station (affiliated to the Taiwan Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station) in Shilin Township, a suburb of Taipei, for two weeks starting from April 17. There are nearly 10,000 large phalaenopsis orchids and 50,000 to 60,000 small ones, which is truly a grand spectacle. Currently blooming are over a thousand phalaenopsis orchids, over five hundred dendrobium orchids, and over a hundred cymbidium orchids. The most valuable of these are the C. Cltftarii Maya fica and B. Laulra varieties, which are in full bloom and gathered in one room for exhibition. In terms of quality and quantity, it not only breaks the record of past Far East exhibitions, but is also an outstanding performer in world orchid exhibitions. The station was established more than 40 years ago, and this is the sixth exhibition since the retrocession (there were only 250 pots during the Japanese era). There were only three pots in the first exhibition, and only three hundred pots in the fifth exhibition last autumn. Orchids are difficult to cultivate, and the orchids in full bloom this time have been cultivated for at least seven years. In addition, the station is also engaged in citrus breeding, cultivation, and transplantation. It started tropical fruit forest, coffee, grape, and vegetable introduction and cultivation experiments in the spring of 1935.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Chinese National Trade Corporation in Taiwan stated that the comparison between the daily sales loans and the number of customers entering the store when the company was first established on April 15 last year and the current situation proves that the purchasing power of the compatriots in the province is much weaker than it was a year ago. Over the past year, commodity prices in the province have risen by an average of 30 times. For example, the price of a thermos was 6,000 Taiwan dollars a year ago and is now 200,000 Taiwan dollars. Various shirts cost 4,000 Taiwan dollars each a year ago and now cost 120,000 Taiwan dollars. The company's daily sales loans were 3 million yuan a year ago and are now 100 million yuan. However, the average number of customers entering the store daily is now 5,000, an increase of 1,000 compared to 4,000 a year ago. This shows that the purchasing power of the people in the province is weaker than it was a year ago.</p>
<p>Cai Zhang, Chairman of the Ryukyu Revolutionary Comrades Association in Taiwan, recently made a statement on the Ryukyu issue. He believes that in the current complex international situation, in order to clarify the issue of the Ryukyu Islands' destination, attention from all parties should be awakened again. He said: Unfortunately, after the victory of the United Nations, the international situation changed, and the issue of the Ryukyu Islands' destination violated the United Nations' original sacred measures for the Ryukyu Islands, which caused a deformed situation that was not satisfied by the liberation movement of small and weak nations. It is a pity! It is a matter of course in principle that the Ryukyu Islands should break away from the Japanese territory, and there is no fault in law, economy, history, or ethnicity. On June 5, 1936, the Japanese government's so-called "request to reclaim "Ryukyu" in consideration of Japanese feelings" was actually just an empty argument of the military's disguised imperialists' consistent tactics. He also said: We dare to assert that Japan has already lost any right to speak on the demands of Ryukyu. Ryukyu has been exploited by Japan for more than 70 years, without the original consent of Ryukyu and China. Even if a very small number of Ryukyuans now hope to belong to Japan, this is also a degraded mentality forced by oppression. Most people recognize that they have broken away from Japan and are more aware of the importance of Ryukyu's revival. Ryukyu has been spared from destruction since ancient times, thanks to the protection of its home country, China. The combination of China and Ryukyu is inevitable in principle. He also said: For example, the recent rumors about the status of Taiwan are clearly instigated by international schemers, which is equivalent to the distorted propaganda that deliberately regards Ryukyu and Japan as one and the same. Taiwan should be the eternal territory of China, and Ryukyu should also be a piece of recovered land of China. We must be more vigilant and cooperate sincerely in the future to avoid being fooled by international schemers.</p>
<p>Fu Sinian, President of National Taiwan University, has recently been very reluctant to talk to newspaper reporters. The day before yesterday, by chance, Fu was surrounded by reporters at Taiwan University. He was unwilling to comment on the arrest of students this time. When it came to internal problems at Taiwan University, Fu was very distressed. He said that he had a headache. For example, things inside the school are often stolen recently. Several lenses worth 200 million Taiwan dollars in the instrument room suddenly disappeared. A reward of 5 million yuan was offered, and fortunately both the person and the stolen goods were recovered. In addition, houses in various colleges were sublet, and professors did not attend classes to run solo, asking people to substitute for classes. The substitutes also disappeared. Such things must be sorted out! When it came to political issues, Fu said: At present, because I am the president of the university, it is inconvenient to express political opinions. In fact, I am very bored, but in order to form an atmosphere of academic research in the school, I naturally do not talk about politics, otherwise, if the president can talk about it, then the students can talk about it. Fu used a story as an example. He said: Someone built a new house, and the walls were freshly painted. In order to prevent people from scribbling on the walls, he wrote the words "This wall cannot be painted" on the wall. A naughty child added the sentence "Why do you want to paint?" This person then wrote the sentence "I own the wall, I can paint", but the naughty child then added the sentence "Everyone paints". This is the story that Fu told, and it can also be seen from his mood, so he felt bored. Another reporter asked him if he had seen Soong Tzu-wen this time. He laughed and said: "How can I see him? After I scolded him, we met once, but we didn't talk. Recently, I wanted to go to Caoshan Hot Springs to take a bath and rest, but because he is in Caoshan, I didn't go." The reporter said, are you afraid of him? President Fu smiled again and said, how can I be afraid of him? Fu also told a joke: The day before yesterday, the American consul hosted a banquet, and he originally wanted to go, but later his wife said that Soong Tzu-wen might be invited, so he called to ask, and if Soong Tzu-wen was present, he would not go, but the American consul did not invite Soong. However, the American consul asked Fu, why don't you go if Soong is present? Fu said to the consul: "You are too ignorant of Chinese affairs."</p>
<h3>A Perspective on Smuggling Routes in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>[A Guangzhou Dispatch, 1st Day of the Month] The primary smuggling routes in Guangdong can be divided into sea and land routes. Although there is some smuggling by air, it is rare due to high costs and unsuitability for bulky goods.</p>
<p>Smuggling into the country by sea can be further categorized into several forms: (1) Consolidation of Small Quantities: A private smuggling company sends a large number of people to carry goods in small amounts on ships traveling between Hong Kong and the province back to Guangzhou. After arriving, they meet at a pre-arranged location to consolidate the goods for wholesale or delivery to local merchants. These smugglers typically have limited capital and struggle to establish leadership. They mainly deal in light goods such as Western medicine, gold, and flannel. (2) Fleeting Opportunity: This form is usually carried out by people working on ships traveling between Hong Kong and the province. It's quite aggressive, with ship personnel pooling funds. Sometimes, an entire hold is filled with smuggled goods. They exploit their familiarity and ease of concealment, making it relatively safe. Some established smugglers also engage in this by paying a substantial price to bribe the crew. If the crew is doing it themselves, they usually carry cigarettes, tires, or other easily sold items. (3) Power-Based: This type has a more robust scale, backing, and capital base. As such, their smuggling isn't particularly secretive. They likely use money or connections to bribe officials at each checkpoint in advance, then openly transport goods by ship directly from Hong Kong to the city, but not directly to Guangzhou. Instead, they unload near Guangzhou and transfer the goods by small boats. This type of organization often consists of disillusioned politicians and failed businessmen who have joined forces. Due to their behind-the-scenes connections, they are rarely discovered or apprehended. Insiders say this form of smuggling, while safe, has thin profit margins due to high expenses for greasing palms.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three types, there is also a forceful approach. These operations are based in towns near Hong Kong or Kowloon, such as Dongguan, Taiping, Shiqiao, and Shenzhen. These organizations are formed by powerful local figures with immense, often incalculable, capital. Each company owns dozens of high-speed boats equipped with powerful weapons. They smuggle by unloading cargo from Hong Kong on several nights of the month. If intercepted by customs ships, they either flee or concentrate the firepower of dozens of boats to resist. This type of smuggling is consistently considered the most feared by customs officials. Due to their substantial organization and capital, they smuggle anything that is profitable, meaning they import anything at all.</p>
<p>Land Smuggling</p>
<p>Besides the goods smuggled in by sea, some also enter by land.</p>
<p>(1) "Airplane" Style: People running on train rooftops or jumping off at stations. These people in groups of three to five, carrying small packages, are smugglers. Although seemingly independent, they each have a base of operations. They travel between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, mostly working for companies. Insiders call these smugglers "airplane kids." They are mostly employed by smuggling companies, though some work independently. These smuggling companies usually have limited capital.</p>
<p>(2) Profit-Sharing: Miners, lower-level service staff, and cooks on the Guangzhou-Kowloon train pool funds. Each time their train goes to Hong Kong, they take advantage of the opportunity to disembark, buy goods, board the train, and hide the items for transport back. Sometimes, they contact smugglers on the train to distribute the goods, and the profits are shared. The impact of this is limited.</p>
<p>(3) Mobile: This type of organization is quite large, but its headquarters has no fixed address, generally being located in the outskirts of Guangzhou or near Hong Kong and Kowloon. In addition to bribing officials, they are equipped with powerful weapons to protect smuggled goods. This approach is very aggressive, with truck convoys of eight to ten vehicles rushing from Kowloon directly into the mainland. According to insiders, this most often occurs at Man Kam To. They often pre-arrange entry times with customs, with officials leaving their posts at the agreed time, and the company paying the agreed-upon fee afterward.</p>
<p>Export Smuggling</p>
<p>In addition to importing smuggled goods, Guangzhou also has goods being smuggled out. While seemingly less prevalent, with the general perception being that only food is exported, the reality is more complex. Insiders point out that, besides food, items like homespun cloth and various sundries, including beans, are also exported.</p>
<p>The methods of export smuggling are not entirely the same as import smuggling, but there are few significant differences. Waterborne transport accounts for 80%, making it particularly prominent. According to insiders, the methods of export smuggling are very intricate. Most of the goods are first transported to towns and villages near Guangzhou, where they are stored for ten days to half a month before being smuggled out. Last year, the areas most favored by smugglers for assembling goods were near Huangzhuqi, Shiqiao, Dongguan Taiping, or Wanqingsha. This year, due to the economic downturn in various places, most businesses have closed down or restructured their routes. The prosperity of the southwest-to-Macau route is indicative of the changes in smuggling routes this year. Although precise figures for export and import smuggling last year are difficult to obtain, insiders estimate that no fewer than 30,000 people are involved in import smuggling, and 15,000 to 18,000 in export smuggling (these numbers are only for those active in the city). Adding those in the surrounding rural areas, the total number is believed to be as high as 100,000.</p>

<h3>The Dujiangyan Irrigation System: From Prevention to Improvement</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[A Chengdu Dispatch, 28th Day of the Month] The Dujiangyan irrigation system, which has benefited the western Sichuan plain for over two thousand years, has faced repeated floods in western Sichuan in the past two years due to the failure of the weir. This has led to a reevaluation and increased attention to this great project. To observe the changes in the project over the past two years, the reporter made a special trip to Dujiangyan to attend the water release ceremony.</p>
<p>The Hub of Irrigation on the Chengdu Plain</p>
<p>From Chengdu to Guanxian, a vast plain of about one hundred li, this is the heart of the "Land of Abundance." Ditches and canals crisscross the landscape because the Chengdu Plain was formed by the alluvial fan of the Minjiang River. Dujiangyan is the hub of irrigation for the plain. More than two thousand years ago, Li Bing and his son dug away Mount Lidui and built Dujiangyan, dividing the river into inner and outer channels. They passed down maxims for water management. To this day, the entire Dujiangyan project includes: (1) The Hundred-Zhang Dike and Water-Splitting Dam, used to protect the banks and direct the water flow correctly. (2) The new Yuzui (Fish Mouth), serving as the intake for the inner river. (3) The Maca, regulating the water volume. (4) The Leveling Sluice, discharging excess water. (5) The Feisha Weir (Flying Sand Weir), preventing lateral breaches. (6) The Pingkou (Bottleneck), measuring the water level. The entire Dujiangyan dam, spanning over four li, remains in its original scale. Climbing to the Erlang Temple, the stone walls are engraved with the true secrets of Li Bing and his son for managing the weir, praising his instructions to future generations: "Deep pools are difficult, build weirs low... diligent repairs yearly, prevent disasters." As the salutes resound and incense smoke curls, the solemn atmosphere conveys the greatness of the predecessors' legacy. The Sichuan Water Resources Bureau, responsible for managing the water and presiding over the ceremony, has neglected "preventing disasters" and failed to conduct "diligent repairs yearly," leaving a deep sense that the grand plan still exists, the instructions are still there, and two thousand years of progress should make people feel infinitely ashamed when paying tribute to their predecessors.</p>
<p>Several Reforms in the History of the Project</p>
<p>Behind the Erlang Temple is a shrine to Ding Wen-cheng (Shi-zhen), who is worshipped together with Li Bing and his son during the annual memorial ceremony. Ding Baozhen left a very good impression on the people of Sichuan due to his contributions and achievements. He was the first reformer of the Dujiangyan project. During the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, Ding Baozhen, as Governor-General of Sichuan, studied the Dujiangyan water conservancy and deeply felt the suffering of the people from the annual repairs. Seeing the insecurity of the bamboo cage stone dikes, he replaced them with iron pillars and stone piers, incurring countless expenses over the years. Unfortunately, the project was destroyed by floods shortly after completion, resulting in a tragic failure. Ding's failure resulted in his "dismissal from office," but his visionary perspective and courageous reform efforts provided profound inspiration to future generations. Since the Republic of China, warlords have fought for power, and water conservancy funds have been diverted, causing major and minor repairs to be suspended. In recent years, the Dujiangyan dikes have frequently collapsed, and western Sichuan has repeatedly suffered from floods. Only then did the Water Resources Bureau have a thorough repair plan. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, they can only proceed gradually. The Weir Works Department adopted a new method last year, replacing bamboo cages and stone dikes with cement. Last year, a 12-zhang-long (approximately 40 meters) cement project was built on the Feisha Weir, and another 10 zhang (approximately 33 meters) will be continued this year. It is estimated that the entire 80-zhang-long (approximately 267 meters) Feisha Weir will be completely renovated in five or six years. This is another aspect in which we are now ashamed of Ding Wencheng.</p>
<p>New Methods Used for Feisha Weir Repairs</p>
<p>After watching the opening ceremony, the leaders of the Weir Works Department led a tour of the entire weir and the new projects. According to the person in charge, the main project this year is the construction of a cement leveling sluice on the Feisha Weir, which is much stronger than the bamboo cage construction. Its function is to maintain the water volume without overflowing when the inner river's water level is low, and to drain water out when the inner river's water level is high, ensuring that the Feisha Weir will not be destroyed by floods again this year. As for the permanent plan, a large water gate will be built on Dujiangyan to regulate rainfall and cut off the Min River to replace the maca, combining the strengths of both Chinese and Western engineering to thoroughly improve Dujiangyan. But when will this plan succeed? No one can guarantee.</p>
<p>The people of western Sichuan have the most sincere reverence for Dujiangyan and Li Bing, the prefect who created this great project. At this year's opening of the weir, despite the provincial government's austerity measures and the absence of a large-scale event, there were still sixty to seventy thousand spectators from all directions. In particular, the devastating lessons of the floods in western Sichuan over the past two years have made people place even more enthusiastic hope on the repair and improvement of the future project. The reporter saw the rushing floodwaters of the Minjiang River, following the maca being cut down, surging and gushing, and the endless stream of people along the Cheng-Guan road joining the flow, further emphasizing that the prevention and improvement of the Dujiangyan project is truly urgent.</p>
