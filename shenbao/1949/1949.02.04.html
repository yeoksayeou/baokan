<p>〔本報訊〕上海和平代表團定五日由滬乘軍用機飛平。五代表中，冷禦秋氏因江蘇省參議會開會在卽，不能參與，顏惠慶氏雖屬高年，但決意前往，為沿途安全起見，由醫生一人隨行。除四代表外，邵力子·甘介侯氏將同機北飛，協助談判之進行，邵氏定四日由京來滬，會齊出發。甘氏於昨日午後五時起，卽與顏惠慶等各代表於顏宅茶叙，除商定行期外，並硏討有關談判之各項準備工作。會議結束後，於六時赴哥倫比亞路訪孫院長，就大局進行懇商，談話在兩小時以上，至八時許始返國際飯店休息。記者訪甘氏時，詢以上海代表之赴平，諒已獲得中共方面之同意，甘氏謂，此點不能說，但謂「如中共不同意，如何能決定啟程日期」？甘氏否認上海代表團之組織乃由於中共之暗示，謂此乃政府之主動，和平之代價如何，不便討論，但個人之看法，認為和平之可能性甚大。又甘氏此次來滬，所負使命不止一項，惟迄昨為止，尙未與民盟及其他黨派人士進行洽商。和平代表北飛日期決定後，初步任務已吿一段落，定四日晨飛京覆命，謁李代總統請示一切，當日下午卽返滬。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕邵力子返京後，除二日晋謁李代總統報吿外，三日靜居家中，並無任何活動。關於外傳渠應邀將以私人名義與顏惠慶·章士釗·陳光甫·江庸等同赴平，邵氏表示並未接到五人之正式邀請，惟對此可以考慮。又三日京晚報傳率代總統曾請邵以私人名義赴平，轉達李代總統謀和之誠，經探詢後，知卽係顏·章·陳等邀其同行之誤。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島二日電〕京人民和平代表團邱致中等一行，昨因中航公司有所顧慮，未能成行，三日午以交通部長途台無綫電話與北平聯合辦事處通話，他們請薛子正接話，薛未在處，由辦事處參謀長周北峯接談，他們將不能在一日到平原因吿訴北平，並且說如果不能乘飛機來，則將改由陸路，但局答決定保證中航機的安全，並歡迎他們卽能到平。代表團又與平中航負責人敖石朋通話，敖說絕對可以安全降落，中航方面刻已直接聯絡，決定四日載代表團一行飛平。代表團對記者稱，我們所談的是全面和平，不是局部和平。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京三日電〕李代總統之顧問邱昌渭，三日否認外傳李代總統已派遣一私人代表負有「秘密使命」，與淮陰之共軍總部接觸，並勸說共軍在政府企圖求和之間勿進攻之說。邱氏稱：此一傳說乃亳無根據者，按某一通訊社（非合衆社）載稱：李明揚將軍已赴淮陰，負有和平使命。</p>
<p>〔本報台北三日電〕聞程思遠將于四日自京乘專機來台，渠係代表李代總統，向陳主席徵詢時局意見。</p>

<p>〔本報浦鎭三日電〕津浦南段國軍仍固守西葛及其以南地區，共軍主力在滁縣以北，烏衣鎭方面三日雙方僅有便衣活動，共方在該地所派者約百餘人。</p>
<p>〔本報浦鎭三日電〕江淮之間共軍動態，據此問所獲綜合各方報吿，其公佈狀况為：駐於津浦路蚌埠嘉山間者為陳毅之四·七·八·十三等四個縱隊，嘉山滁縣間者為第九縱隊，滁縣為土共淮南獨立旅，全椒為第一縱隊，天長及高郵湖西南地區為二·三·快速·渤海等四個縱隊，邵伯附近為十一·十二兩個縱隊，靖江南通為長江縱隊，其餘六合·揚州·泰興等處皆各分駐土共五六百至千餘不等。總觀共軍整個兵力，除土共不計外，其正規軍共為十三個縱隊，番號雖多，但據此間判斷，自經徐州週圍三大會戰後，其主力損失殆盡，尤以中下級幹部傷亡慘重，最低限度，非經一二月較長時間之休整補訓，殊無法恢復其原有戰鬥力。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京三日電〕共軍對長江綫之壓力三日已予减輕，共軍在若千地點均北撤。鄂豫區共軍諸縱隊已後撤，讓國軍重佔信陽。京畿以北共軍正規部隊亦已撤退，僅留下少數土共。儀徵一度曾傳為共軍佔領四分之三，三日傳稱全無共軍縱跡。傳揚州為土共千人所佔領。長江北岸一帶之唯一小接觸傳在浦口以東之地區，共軍後撤之原因未詳。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕國防部頃發表一月廿七日至二月二日之一週戰局如次：</p>
<p>本週因値春節，各綫僅有小接觸，無大戰事，國軍仍本備戰謀和宗旨，除鞏固長江防務外，未作新行動，戰局概况如左：</p>
<p>長江方面共軍調動頻繁，現長江北岸東起南通，西迄全椒之綫，陳毅所部共軍約有十個縱除，其第一·四·七·十三等縱隊係在滁縣，全椒一帶。第二·三及渤海快速等縱隊在天和·六合地區。另在蘇北地區分踞其第十一·十二等縱隊，長江支隊則積極竄擾由南通至泰興沿江各地，國軍於廿八日自動撤離如皋，二日撤離南通，加強江北橋頭陣地，各部共軍，一部似正積極作渡江準備，大部則在江淮地區整補，迄至目前，似尙無渡江南犯之兵力，我强大海陸空軍，已密切聯繫，完成部署，監視北岸共軍，同時我長江北岸各前衛基地，實力甚為雄厚，津浦南段國軍主力，仍固守兩浦地區。</p>
<p>華中方面　共軍劉伯承舊部第一·二·四，九·十共五個縱隊，已至豫南整補，會同土共張體學·王樹聲·羅厚福等部，連日分向潢川·光山一帶進犯，企圖威脅信陽，我確山國軍一度後撤，惟於獲得增援後，一日復重行進駐該地。鄂西方面共軍三旅，企圖進擾竹山被擊退，華中國軍已有嚴密部署，共軍如敢妄圖一逞，必難達到目的。</p>
<p>太原方面　幷垣週邊共軍，正在積極部署，似有再度發動攻勢模樣，惟該地區共軍多係由晋中各地民兵所撥補者，實力殊為薄弱，如貿然發動攻勢，恐將難逃如過去六次攻勢一樣挫敗之命運</p>
<p>綜觀週來各地雖無重大戰事，但大局為和為戰，其發展極堪注意，國軍遵從政府決策備戰謀和，而決不予人以可乘之機，故今後和戰關鍵，仍取決於共黨對和平是否具有誠意，在國軍方面，己做到「盡其在我」的努力了。</p>
<h3 id="c8">李延年仍坐鎭浦鎭　張淦兵團未東調　某軍事負責人鄭重告記者 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>〔本報浦鎭三日電〕記者頃以上海中外各報所載合衆社南京一日電，以廣西部隊張淦兵團業於一月卅一日替代李延年將軍所部接防浦口，浦鎮，李延年兵團則移駐南岸消息一則，叩詢此間某重要負責人。據談，截至三日下午六時止，此間尙未接獲國防部或京滬杭警備總司令部關於此項侖令，現李延年將軍迄仍坐鎭此間，所部除楊幹才，胡長靑兩軍業調南岸，藉以加强首都外圍防務外，其餘于兆龍軍及新配屬之劉秉哲軍（原係隸屬首都衛戍總部，並兼任兩浦地區指揮官者，但並非廣西部隊）。迄由李將軍指揮中，長江北岸兩浦地區橋頭堡，因地區較窄，事實上無須派駐渦多部隊，就目下現有兵力，再配合佔絕對優勢的海空軍，已足可保衛首都大門而有餘，江南人士實可不必再作不必要顧虞，致自亂步驟。某負責人至此特鄭重吿記者：張淦兵團確係國軍中最優秀兵團之一，據渠所知，該兵團現尙在豫南，最近奉命協同張軫部南在豫作戰。</p>

<p>〔合衆社前駐滬記者羅幹及前駐京記者戈屢孟紐約三日電〕共產黨佔領全中國的最後結果，一般人當無從獲悉，但許多人認為，中國四億五千萬人民的基本生活方式，當不致立卽有所改變。　蘇聯在遠東勢力的增强及美國在遠東的威望的减退，將為中共勝利後的最顯著的結果，同時，東西間影響世界的長期鬥爭，顯亦不可避免。</p>
<p>中共的勝利，使蘇聯在此項鬥爭中獲得絕大的優勢，但若千熟悉中國的人士稱：中共領袖毛澤東雖與莫斯科聯結，然而他將中國人的身份列為第一，而將共產黨列為第二。他們基於此項觀點，認為中國或不致成為堅强的警察國，因此，不像其他人士那樣地担心。據悉：美國官方人士亦懷有類似的希望。</p>
<p>不論長期鬥爭的結果如何，下列的立卽結果，幾乎為中共完全勝利後必然發生者：</p>
<p>（一）建立絕對為中共所控制的「聯合政府」，自由份子或者甚至前國民黨領袖將被包括在內，但他們決無否決中共建議的權力。</p>
<p>（二）無情地淸算國民黨，中共早已要求此點為和平的代價，中共的宣傳也早已嚴斥「蔣·宋·孔·陳四大家族」，指斥他們在過去二十年中，從中國竊取了二百億美元。</p>
<p>（三）對在華的外國資本及商業，提出若干建議，中共亟需消費貨物，重工業機器及外資，以重建破碎的國家，毛澤東在過去早已指出，中國必須藉私人資本的協助，通過一個「復甦」的階段，然後始能推行全而社會主義計劃，但外國商業則勢將受到嚴格的管制。</p>
<p>（四）嚴格地遵照黨綱，推動土地及敎育改革，此兩項政策為中共佔領區內所推行的基本政策，在中國若干地區，均曾出現對此兩項政策的堅强的農民反抗，故此項計劃可能以緩進方式，以防止反抗及喪失人民的信心。</p>

<h3 id="c18">和乎？降乎？ <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>和平空氣，在這一個月來，令人有撲朔迷離之感。越是大家希望和平，越是覺得和平可望而不可即。這原因究竟在那裏，就因為大家在意識上沒有先把和談與投降分别淸楚。故今日之事，我們先要研討：政府對於中共，究竟作什麼準備？和乎？降乎？</p>
<p>什麼是和？戰爭的雙方都覺得武力終究不能解決國事，尤其覺得生靈塗炭，不能長此犧牲人民，乃毅然放棄戰爭手段，改用政治方式商定一切國家大計，為人民减少痛苦。這是和平。故和平的出發點有三：（一）雙方全為人民着想；（二）雙方澈悟武力之不可終恃；（三）彼此承認對方的對等地位。</p>
<p>什麼是降？戰爭的一方自覺其巳經全無作戰能力，而承認另一方為完全戰勝的征服者，因而放下武器，聽受對方一切支配，初不計及其結果將使人民受什麼影響。這是投降。故投降的出發點亦有三：（一）並非眞為人民着想；（二）由於武力不敵；（三）自甘放棄其對等地位。</p>
<p>明乎此，我們可以檢討目前全面和平之所以可望而不可即者，就因為和平的三出發點似乎尙未具備。惟其不具備，所以和平顯然尙有障碍。我們只要回顧下列一連串的事實，便可曉然。（一）蔣總統元旦文吿發表，倡導和平，指出五點和平原則，並表示個人進退出處絕不縈懷，舉國人民欣欣然有喜色，以為和平曙光已露。（二）詎知中共挨過了兩星期，復於一月十四日由毛澤東先生廣播『懲辦戰犯』等八項和談基礎條件，曙光似又蒙了暗影。（三）十九日行政院希望雙方立即停戰並各派代表進行和談。（四）二十一日蔣總統更毅然『身先引退，以冀弭戰銷兵，』由李副總統代行職權，繼續謀取和平。（五）二十二日政府並已派定邵力子張治中等五人為代表，以候中共派遣代表，指定地點的答復。（六）二十二日，李代總統更發文吿，「以高度之誠意與最大之努力，謀取和平之實現。』且下手諭，決定實行撤消特刑庭釋放政治犯等七項措施，以示謀和之誠意。（七）但是二十五日，中共廣播却指責政府的謀和為虛偽，並說「戰犯』決不止四十三個。二十六日中共廣播又增加了許多「戰犯』，並且要求政府先行逮捕。（八）二十七日，李代總統仍電毛澤東先生，為民請命，承認可以中共八項條件為基礎，進行和談。照理，毛先生以前旣說『國民黨：應當放棄其『反動的』條件，承認中國共產黨提出的八個條件，為雙方從事和談的基礎，』則李代總統去電承認此為基礎之後，中共就該指派代表，與政府進行和談了。（九0然而中共又於二十九日廣播聲明，强調立即逮捕「戰犯』四十三名為先決條件，（此阻十三名包括李代總統與孫院長自己）並必須進行「淸算」「鬥爭。」但始終未提及指派代表。（十）十一日，政府答復中共聲明，仍盼中共也以最高的誠意促成和會早開。李代總統且於同日飛滬，邀請顏惠慶博士等五人赴平，以私人資格探詢中共　意，但至今中共方面尙無絲亳派遣代表的表示，而上海的五代表尙未飛平，南京人民代表的飛平之行却已由靑島碰壁歸來了。</p>
<p>由於上面事實的叙述，讀者當知和平陣礙之所在，就在於中共已以完全征服者自居之一念。充此一念之所至，中共當已不復置念人民仍受戰禍之痛苦，且自信其武力當可統一中國，而不必以對等地位看待李代總統所領導的國民政府。充此一念之所至，中共的心目中，蓋已不啻視李代總統幷岡村寗次而不如。因為當岡村寗次奉日皇之命率其在華皇軍投降之時，倒還沒有先逮捕了自己或提了自己的頭來晋謁我們的受降主管的。</p>
<p>我們相信在蔣總統息隱林泉以後，李代總統繼志述事，領導人民所爭取的是和平而不是投降。我們更願中共的領袖們看淸楚這一點，接受李代總統的誠意，謀取全面和平的實現。假使中共不此之圖，而一定要扮演一齣「受降」典禮，則我們老百姓深恐在政府固未必就願投降，而人民反將因中共一念之差而重罹戰禍，更陷於萬刧不復之境。</p>
<p>其在政府方面，如果不顧人民未來的禍害而願投降則巳，否則就當盡力謀對等的和平。然则如何可獲致對等的和平呢？簡單說來：第一是內部認眞團結；第二是全力固守江防；第三是澈底澄淸政治，決心與民更始；第四是實行民生主義，安定社會秩序。至少必須如此眞幹實幹苦幹，方可以文武一致，軍民合作，恢復其自身强大的力量，示人以不可輕侮，可戰而不必戰，以從事於和平，而後對等的眞和平纔可獲得。不然，降而已矣，和於何有？</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據此問經合分署息：中美農村復興聯合委員會委員晏陽初博士，昨曾就該委會支持之四川省第三區新農村改進計劃，發表談話如次：「民衆之興趣，已被激起，此一計劃，並非由外界加諸當地人民，當地人民需要此一計劃，改進農村之基本技術，已有開展，本地之領導人材，亦在培養中。「又美方委員莫懿爾則稱：「經騐已顯示完整之計劃，實為眞正改善人民生活狀况所必需，」農村復興委會之基本工作，乃「與現有之機構合作，建立在改進農村方面所應從事工作之概念，並設立必要機構，以資執行。」一如該委會其他計劃，第三區計劃，在其目前工作完成後，並不就此結束。依據此一計劃，該委會將設置一項基金，以繼續執行川省之農村計劃。基金將用於貸給或輔助各項計劃，其來源則係民衆償還該委會或基金之貸款。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕改善四川省第三區五百萬中國農民生活之統盤計劃，在中美農村復興聯合委會支助之下業已開始，此項計劃係以包羅豐富之辦法改進農村，而非以零散之辦法改進農村，此項計劃將集中於中美農村復興委會之五個主要目標，卽農業，農田租借，地方自治，行政管理，保健與成人社會敎育。民衆敎育運動已為此項計劃奠定一種基礎，因在戰爭之後，民衆敎育運動曾從事一項計劃。第三區鄰近重慶，其中包括十縣與一特別區，新計劃卽將在此一曾經從事試騐之地區，開始工作。在中美農村復興委會與當地所作之聯合努力下，將使下列各項計劃成為可能，計（一）成立二百個新的生產合作社，以解決農佃問題。（二）敎育第三區之一百九十餘萬不識字之成人及未入學之兒童。（三）保護並改進第三區民衆之健康。（四）協助紡織合作運動在璧山縣中滋長。（五）開築小型之灌溉地。（六）增加該區之牲畜。</p>

<h3 id="c38">艾契遜國務卿發表聲明　美拒與蘇單獨談判　斥責史達林玩弄國際政治　蘇如具有誠意儘可遵循正常途徑解決 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕國務卿艾契遜指責史達林總理建議與杜魯門總統會晤及簽訂一非戰條約，乃以和平玩弄國際政治。艾氏稱，世界對和平之興趣乃基本地，此事非能偽造者，亦不能為任何國際政治手段之工具，美國將不會如此地利用和平。先是白宮方面稱，杜魯門總統並未接獲來自史達林之正式電訊，但杜魯門仍一貫其原來立塲稱渠凖備及願意在華盛頓會晤史達林。艾契遜在歷時一小時之記者招待會中稱，若史達林眞正願意與杜魯門談和平，史氏可經由官方處理，無需經由報界。艾氏之聲明乃美國官方第一次對史氏所提建議之反應。艾氏逐點指出如下：第一，美國與蘇聯間之一切正常外交途徑仍洞啟，此項事情儘可循此途徑辦理。第二，渠認為美國總統第四次跋涉半個世界與史達林會晤，討論不可捉摸之問題，實無補於事。第三美國不願與任何一國單獨談判牽涉其他國家利益之任何疸，除非此等國家亦被邀參加。第四，艾氏理想蘇聯在聯合國獲致原子能管制，世界裁軍及設立國際警衛軍之協定時，常採取阻撓行動。第五，艾氏宣稱，蘇聯在聯合國會議中使用否決權，業已使和平解決各項糾紛之聯合國憲章之目的受到打擊。第六史達林曾審愼表示，願訂美蘇和約，艾氏對此已予拒絕。艾氏宣稱，美蘇兩國於簽訂聯合國憲章時，早已互約決不從事戰爭。第七，艾氏重述杜魯門在就職時宣布美國始終擁護聯合國之主張。艾氏稱，杜氏「並不是說他準備考慮發表這個主張，可是他已經把這個主張明明白白地說出來了。」</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦三日電〕經美國再保證不舉行史杜會議以結束冷戰後，西歐國家遂吿釋然。西歡人士在對史達林聲明願與杜魯門談和一節感到惶惑之際，甚疑蘇聯之「春季和平攻勢」，及由此引起之任何私下談判。美國務卿艾契遜斷然拒絕史達林之建議，掃除所有存在之憂念。英官員等最直言無諱，斥史達林之建議純屬宣傳。艾德禮首相擬於三日吿議會內之發問者，謂渠拒絕由英國促成杜史會議之一切建議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎二日電〕法總理居伊今日應英美記者宴會時曾稱，杜魯門史達林如允在法國境內會晤，則法國願予歡迎。居伊稱，史氏今應明白宣佈其眞正意志，如談話目的乃在奠定世界和平，則吾人自願一致贊同，而歡迎獲致一種諒解。法國願與其他有關之列强竭力消除戰爭威脅，假使雙方能各表示相等之誠意。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦二日電〕史達林對美國的「紙上談判」，已刺激西歐國國家加速完成大西洋安全公約。一般認為及早完成公約，將加强西方對抗此項壓力的力量。西方的反應一般均屬懷疑性的，但亦有一種潛在的希望，卽世界兩最大國家的領袖或亦可能同意休止「冷戰」？此間西方人士解釋，可能獲得價値二十億元之美國配備為後盾的大西洋集團給予蘇聯的影響，顯然遠在任何與「冷戰」有關的外交及政治措施之上。公約如吿完成，可使杜魯門獲得一堅强的大西洋同盟的支持。在任何對史達林的可能會談中，更能具有討價還價的餘地。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊歷年關渡過後，食米價格連日瘋狂上漲，市府鑒於食米價格直接影響一般物價，對此種不合理現象，決以高壓手段加以抑平。吳市長特於昨午五時在市府會議室召集本市米商代表談話，商討抑平米價之緊急措置，經共同商定辦法如下：卽日起由糧食部每日撥白粳米五千担供應本市，同時限各米商負責每日供應五千祖（白粳）應市。市民可憑國民身份證所附之五號及六號准購證，向各米店買米。每證限買五升，共計一斗，以十五市斤計算。每担批價為四千五百元，另售門市價規定不得超過四千八百元。今（四日）日起，卽可憑六號准購證向米店購買米商所售之食米五升，五號准購證須俟明（五日）起始准購買。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕自報載工商部將恢復限制紗布南運辦法，以期抑平市價各訊後，六區棉紡同業認為廢層春節開市，各項物價飛漲，其重要因素，乃屬於金融性以及一般生產成本之激增，已往曾實施限制或停止紗布南運，但其結果非特不能收抑平市價之效，反使華南各地人民衣着發生恐慌。且最近滬上紗布銷售區域，巳日益狹窄。若將僅存之華南市塲，亦加以限制，不啻壅塞各廠生機，幷使二十餘萬之棉紡織工瀕於絕境，其影響實深且鉅。聞該公會各常務理事，偕同秘書長汪竹一等，曾於昨晨晋謁工商部劉部長，面陳棉紡業實際因難情形，請對限制紗布南運辦法，免予實施，以安民生，而抒商困。當由劉部畏指示，對紗布南遝暫行登記，至所請完全免予限制一節，允予考慮云。</p>

<p>昨日本市銀根，鬆勢未戢。金融當局抽縮無由，乃為最大原因。聞華北局面改觀以後，金圓大量南流，故本市通貨之泛濫程度，益見加深。市塲需求雖冗，但供源尤旺，兜拆之事，重又出現。暗息在日拆卅元上下，低見廿五元有供，落入行莊欠息以內。衆信：今後銀根走勢，難能控制，物價前途堪慮。</p>
<p>現鈔昨日奇裕，行莊再無提取限額，但所付出者均為以繩為紮之舊鈔，足見通貨連日回籠一斑。本票日來大减，貼水斂跡。</p>

<p>棉布漲勢仍極堅强，南運限制後，傳海關尙可裝出，故廣帮再猛力搜求，散戶跟進，新高峯層出不窮。四君子元嗶嘰晨開卽出五千元大關，以五二〇〇元開盤，塲內買氣瀰慢，再再上升。至十時三刻許，進抵六六五〇元新高價。臨收稍回，終以六五〇〇元午收。較上日軋堅一千七百五十元。雷峯塔元嗶嘰六二〇〇元有成交。中檔細布均在五千六百元邊徘徊。色布續升，龍頭細布塲外喊七千元，軋升二千元。同業趁高頻吐，臨收喊價雖高，但成交轉稀。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Peace Delegation is scheduled to fly to Peiping on the 5th via military aircraft from Shanghai. Among the five delegates, Mr. Leng Yuqiu cannot participate due to the upcoming Jiangsu Provincial Assembly meeting. Although Mr. Yan Huiqing is of advanced age, he is determined to go. For safety along the way, a doctor will accompany him. In addition to the four delegates, Shao Lizi and Gan Jiehou will fly north on the same plane to assist in the negotiations. Mr. Shao is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Peiping on the 4th and depart together. Mr. Gan, starting at 5:00 PM yesterday, had tea with Yan Huiqing and other delegates at Yan's residence. In addition to agreeing on the travel schedule, they also discussed various preparations for the negotiations. After the meeting, they visited President Sun at Columbia Road at 6:00 PM for a sincere discussion on the overall situation, which lasted for more than two hours, returning to the International Hotel for rest around 8:00 PM. When a reporter interviewed Mr. Gan, asking if the trip to Peiping by the Shanghai representatives had been approved by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Mr. Gan said he could not comment, but stated, "If the CCP did not agree, how could the departure date be determined?" Mr. Gan denied that the organization of the Shanghai delegation was due to the CCP's suggestion, saying that it was the government's initiative. He said that the price of peace was inconvenient to discuss, but he personally believed that the possibility of peace was very high. In addition, Mr. Gan's mission to Shanghai was not limited to one item. However, as of yesterday, he had not yet consulted with the China Democratic League and other party members. With the decision made on the date of the peace delegation's flight north, the initial task has come to a conclusion. He is scheduled to fly to Peiping on the morning of the 4th to report back and consult Acting President Li on everything, returning to Shanghai in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] After Shao Lizi returned to Peiping, he reported to Acting President Li on the 2nd. On the 3rd, he stayed quietly at home without any activities. Regarding the rumors that he had been invited to go to Peiping in a private capacity with Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Chen Guangfu, and Jiang Yong, Mr. Shao stated that he had not received a formal invitation from the five individuals, but he could consider it. Furthermore, the "Jing Evening News" reported on the 3rd that Acting President Li had asked Mr. Shao to go to Peiping in a private capacity to convey Acting President Li's sincerity in seeking peace. After inquiries, it was learned that this was a misunderstanding that Yan, Zhang, Chen, and others had invited him to travel together.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao, 2nd] The Peiping People's Peace Delegation, including Qiu Zhizhong and others, were unable to travel yesterday due to concerns from the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). At noon on the 3rd, they spoke with the Peiping Joint Office via the Ministry of Transportation's long-distance wireless telephone. They asked Xue Zizheng to answer the call, but Xue was not in the office, so Chief of Staff Zhou Beifeng spoke with them. They told Peiping the reasons why they could not arrive in Peiping on the 1st and said that if they could not come by plane, they would change to land travel. However, the bureau replied that it was determined to ensure the safety of the CNAC plane and welcomed them to arrive in Peiping immediately. The delegation also spoke with Ao Shipeng, the person in charge of the CNAC in Peiping, who said that a safe landing was absolutely possible. The CNAC side has directly contacted them and decided to fly the delegation to Peiping on the 4th. The delegation told reporters, "What we are talking about is comprehensive peace, not partial peace."</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 3rd] Qiu Changwei, advisor to Acting President Li, denied on the 3rd the rumors that Acting President Li had dispatched a private representative with a "secret mission" to contact the Communist Army Headquarters in Huaiyin and persuade the Communist Army not to attack while the government was attempting to seek peace. Mr. Qiu stated: "This rumor is completely unfounded." According to a certain news agency (not United Press), General Li Mingyang has gone to Huaiyin on a peace mission.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taipei, 3rd] It is reported that Cheng Siyuan will come to Taiwan from Peiping on the 4th via special plane. He represents Acting President Li to solicit Chairman Chen's opinions on the current situation.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 3rd] The heads of ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan who have relocated to Guangzhou and senior officials held a symposium at 10:00 AM on the 3rd to discuss the issue of work contact with personnel remaining in Peiping.</p>

On the morning of the 3rd, a special plane was originally scheduled to transport the personnel of the French and Dutch embassies to Guangzhou, but the flight was unsuccessful due to a temporary aircraft malfunction.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, telegraphed Sun Ke, President of the Executive Yuan, on the 1st, asking him to return to Peiping to jointly plan for major strategies to facilitate peace talks.

<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The government's relocation to Guangzhou is being actively carried out.

<h3 id="e4">Xue Yue Telegrams Acting President Li to Clarify Associated Press Telegram <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] Xue Yue, Chairman of Guangdong, telegraphed Acting President Li on the 3rd to clarify and explain the content of his talk published by the Associated Press on the 31st. In his telegram, Mr. Xue reported to Acting President Li that the content of the talk published by the Associated Press was inaccurate. He also stated that the local area has no opinions on the major plans for peace and war, and that everything is based on the central government's decisions, and the local area should obey the central government's decisions.</p>
<p>[Ta Kung Pao Guangzhou, 3rd] Chairman Xue Yue recently hosted reporters for the first time, revealing his administrative guidelines. The content was roughly the same as his report to the Provincial Assembly yesterday. He continued, "Being appointed to lead Guangdong this time is like 'a cow climbing a tree'." However, he has the determination to sacrifice himself to save Guangdong and save the country. In the future, his administration will adhere to the three principles of political freedom, economic democracy, and military self-defense, and all financial budgets, personnel appointments, and handling of affairs will be absolutely transparent. When reporters asked about reports in some Hong Kong Chinese newspapers that he had told Associated Press reporters that he had announced the independence of the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, Mr. Xue replied that the reports were quite different from his original intention in the conversation. The Associated Press correspondent in Guangzhou also stated that only some Hong Kong Chinese newspapers had mistranslated the original intention. Finally, Mr. Xue called for strengthening unity, saying, "We must work hard together in life and go our separate ways in death."</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Southern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Remains Calm; National Army in Nantong Voluntarily Withdraws from the Urban Area; Rumor Has It That Regular Communist Army Troops on the North Bank of the Yangtze River Are Retreating North <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Puzhen, 3rd] The National Army in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is still firmly defending Xige and the area south of it. The main force of the Communist Army is north of Chuxian. On the 3rd, there was only plainclothes activity on both sides in the Wuyi Town area. The Communist side sent about a hundred people to the area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Puzhen, 3rd] Regarding the movements of the Communist Army between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, according to the comprehensive reports obtained from various sources in this area, the publicized situation is as follows: stationed between Bengbu and Jiashan on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are Chen Yi's four columns, the 4th, 7th, 8th, and 13th. The 9th Column is located between Jiashan and Chuxian. Chuxian is occupied by the local Communist Huainan Independent Brigade. The 1st Column is in Quanjiao. The 2nd, 3rd, Rapid, and Bohai columns are located in the southwest area of Tianchang and Gaoyou Lake. The 11th and 12th columns are near Shaobo. The Yangtze River Column is in Jingjiang and Nantong. The remaining areas of Luhe, Yangzhou, and Taixing are each garrisoned by local Communists numbering from five or six hundred to over a thousand. Looking at the overall strength of the Communist Army, excluding the local Communists, its regular army has a total of thirteen columns. Although there are many numbers, it is judged here that after the three major battles around Xuzhou, its main force was almost completely lost, especially the casualties of middle and lower-level cadres were heavy. At the very least, without a relatively long period of rest and reorganization, it would be impossible to restore its original combat power.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 3rd] The Communist Army's pressure on the Yangtze River line has been reduced on the 3rd. The Communist Army has retreated north in some locations. The Communist columns in the Hubei-Henan area have withdrawn, allowing the National Army to reoccupy Xinyang. The regular Communist Army troops north of the capital area have also retreated, leaving only a few local Communists. Yizheng was once rumored to be three-quarters occupied by the Communist Army, but on the 3rd, it was reported that there was no trace of the Communist Army. It is said that Yangzhou is occupied by a thousand local Communists. The only small contact along the north bank of the Yangtze River is reported to be in the area east of Pukou. The reason for the Communist Army's retreat is unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] Regarding Nantong, after the National Army voluntarily withdrew from the urban area at the end of last month, on the night of the 31st, about a thousand soldiers from three regiments, 104, 105, and 106, belonging to the Communist Army's Yangtze River Column, harassed the Langshan and Jinshan areas from Xingren Town, northeast of Nantong City. They were repelled by Gu Xijiu's troops of the National Army. As of the evening of the 1st, Jin and Lang mountains were still firmly defended by the National Army, and the Communist Army retreated to the eastern part of Nantong City. In addition, more than three thousand soldiers from three regiments, 101, 102, and 103, also belonging to the Yangtze River Column of the Communist Army, scurried from Huangqiao, northeast of Taixing, to the Baiyitang area of Jingjiang on the night of the 31st. The National Army has been paying attention to them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] Liu Jizhi, the county magistrate of Hengshan County, newly established by the Chinese Communists at the junction of Jiangning and Dangtu, is leading more than four hundred local Communists and has been active in the Yuntai Mountain and Hengshan area in recent days. The National Army has dispatched troops to encircle and suppress them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 3rd] Yesterday, some newspapers in Peiping and Shanghai carried a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 1st, saying that the Navy had shelled Yizheng County and the county magistrate was injured. This reporter recently met with Lin, the commander of the Navy stationed in Zhen, who said that as of now, the city is still firmly defended by the National Army and local teams, and the joint defense by the Navy and Army is very complete, so there is no reason to shell it. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren is currently in Zhen asking for reinforcements and weapons and is not injured in the slightest.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiangyin, 3rd] At 1:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, the Communist Army in Jingjiang harassed the National Army in Bawu Port and was repelled. The situation in Chengdi is still safe, but the number of people fleeing to Shanghai is increasing daily.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 3rd] Zhang Qun flew from Peiping to Chongqing at 12:30 PM on the 3rd. His trip was very secret. Deng Xihou and others were supposed to attend Lu Zuofu's banquet at noon, but only Zhang Xiang, Director of the Chongqing Telecommunications Bureau, went to Baishiyi Airport to welcome him back to the Presidential Residence in Zengjiayan for rest. Mr. Zhang refused to meet with reporters. Fan Songyao and Liao Kaitao visited Mr. Zhang to report on the situation of the Pacification Headquarters.

<h3 id="e7">Ministry of National Defense Announces: A Week's War Situation <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 3rd] The Ministry of National Defense recently announced the war situation for the week from January 27 to February 2 as follows:</p>
<p>This week, due to the Spring Festival, there were only minor contacts on various lines and no major battles. The National Army still adheres to the principle of preparing for war and seeking peace. In addition to consolidating the Yangtze River defense, no new actions have been taken. The general situation of the war is as follows:</p>
<p>On the Yangtze River front, the Communist Army is moving frequently. Currently, on the north bank of the Yangtze River, from Nantong in the east to Quanjiao in the west, Chen Yi's Communist Army has about ten columns. The 1st, 4th, 7th, and 13th columns are in the Chuxian and Quanjiao area. The 2nd, 3rd, Bohai, and Rapid columns are in the Tianhe and Luhe area. In addition, the 11th and 12th columns are located in northern Jiangsu. The Yangtze River Detachment is actively harassing various places along the Yangtze River from Nantong to Taixing. On the 28th, the National Army voluntarily withdrew from Rugao, and on the 2nd, it withdrew from Nantong, strengthening the bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River. Some of the Communist Army units appear to be actively preparing to cross the Yangtze River, while most of them are reorganizing and replenishing in the Huai River area. As of now, it seems that there are no troops with the strength to cross the Yangtze River and invade the south. Our powerful naval, land, and air forces have closely coordinated and completed deployments to monitor the Communist Army on the north bank. At the same time, our advanced bases on the north bank of the Yangtze River are very strong. The main force of the National Army in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is still firmly defending the areas of Pukou and Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>In Central China, the Communist Army Liu Bocheng's old units, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th columns, a total of five columns, have gone to southern Henan for reorganization and replenishment. Together with the local Communist forces of Zhang Tixue, Wang Shusheng, and Luo Houfu, they have been attacking the Huangchuan and Guangshan area in recent days, attempting to threaten Xinyang. The National Army in Queshan once retreated, but after receiving reinforcements, it reoccupied the area on the 1st. In western Hubei, the Communist Army's Third Brigade attempted to harass Zhushan but was repelled. The National Army in Central China has strict deployments. If the Communist Army dares to act recklessly, it will be difficult to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>In the Taiyuan area, the Communist Army around Pingyao is actively deploying, seemingly preparing to launch another offensive. However, most of the Communist Army in the area are replenished by militiamen from various places in central Shanxi, and their strength is very weak. If they rashly launch an offensive, they will probably be unable to escape the fate of failure like the past six offensives.</p>
<p>Overall, although there have been no major battles in various places in the past week, the development of the overall situation, whether for peace or war, is extremely noteworthy. The National Army follows the government's policy of preparing for war and seeking peace and will never give others an opportunity to take advantage of. Therefore, the key to peace or war in the future still depends on whether the Communist Party has sincerity for peace. On the part of the National Army, it has done its best.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Puzhen, 3rd] This reporter recently inquired with a certain important person in charge here regarding a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 1st, carried by various Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai, stating that Zhang Gan's Guangxi troops had replaced General Li Yannian's troops on January 31 to take over the defense of Pukou and Puzhen, and that Li Yannian's army corps had moved to the south bank. According to him, as of 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, they had not yet received any orders from the Ministry of National Defense or the Garrison Headquarters of Peiping, Shanghai, and Hangzhou regarding this matter. Currently, General Li Yannian is still stationed here. Except for the two armies of Yang Gancai and Hu Changqing, which have been transferred to the south bank to strengthen the defenses around the capital, the remaining army of Yu Zhaolong and the newly assigned army of Liu Bingzhe (originally under the command of the Capital Garrison Headquarters and also served as commander of the Pukou and Zhenjiang area, but not a Guangxi troop) are still under the command of General Li. The bridgeheads on the north bank of the Yangtze River in the Pukou and Zhenjiang area are narrow, and there is actually no need to station too many troops. With the current troop strength, combined with the absolutely dominant naval and air forces, it is more than enough to defend the capital's gateway. People south of the Yangtze River really do not need to worry unnecessarily, causing themselves to panic. A certain person in charge solemnly told reporters at this point: Zhang Gan's army corps is indeed one of the most outstanding army corps in the National Army. As far as he knows, the army corps is currently still in southern Henan and has recently been ordered to cooperate with Zhang Zhen's troops to fight in Henan.</p>

<p>[United Press Peiping, 3rd] The Communist Army held a victory parade here on the 3rd. The streets were crowded with spectators, and the procession was several miles long. Almost all the vehicles used were American-style, including jeeps, dispatch cars, hospital cars, and ordnance cars. Most of the gun carriages and anti-aircraft gun carriages were Japanese-style. Civilians also participated in the parade, shouting slogans and performing costumed performances. Most of the procession passed through Dongjiaominxiang.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Peiping, 3rd] The first restriction announced by the new Peiping government on the evening of the 2nd was to prohibit the taking of photographs of Communist military units and military activities.

<h3 id="e17">Foreign Correspondents Look at China: Unlikely to Become a Strong Police State, but Long-Term Struggle Between US and USSR Unavoidable <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International Former Shanghai Correspondent Logan and Former Beijing Correspondent Gorey, New York, 3rd] The ultimate outcome of the Communist Party's occupation of all of China is generally unknowable, but many believe that the basic lifestyles of China's 450 million people will not change immediately. The increased influence of the Soviet Union in the Far East and the decline of American prestige in the Far East will be the most significant results of the CCP's victory. Simultaneously, a long-term struggle between East and West for influence over the world is clearly unavoidable.</p>
<p>The CCP's victory gives the Soviet Union a tremendous advantage in this struggle, but some who are familiar with China say: Although CCP leader Mao Zedong is linked to Moscow, he puts his Chinese identity first and the Communist Party second. Based on this view, they believe that China is unlikely to become a strong police state, and therefore do not worry as much as others do. It is reported that American officials also harbor similar hopes.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome of the long-term struggle, the following immediate results are almost certain to occur after the CCP's complete victory:</p>
<p>(1) The establishment of a "united government" absolutely controlled by the CCP. Free individuals or even former Kuomintang leaders will be included, but they will have no power to veto CCP proposals.</p>
<p>(2) A ruthless liquidation of the Kuomintang. The CCP has long demanded this as the price of peace. CCP propaganda has also severely denounced the "Four Big Families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen," accusing them of stealing 20 billion US dollars from China in the past twenty years.</p>
<p>(3) Proposals regarding foreign capital and businesses in China. The CCP urgently needs consumer goods, heavy industrial machinery, and foreign investment to rebuild the shattered nation. Mao Zedong has stated in the past that China must go through a "recovery" phase with the help of private capital before it can implement full socialist programs, but foreign businesses will inevitably be subject to strict controls.</p>
<p>(4) Strict adherence to the party program, promoting land and education reform. These two policies are the basic policies implemented in the CCP-occupied areas. In some areas of China, there has been strong peasant resistance to these two policies. Therefore, this plan may be implemented in a gradual manner to prevent resistance and loss of public confidence.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Peace? Surrender? <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The atmosphere of peace has been confusing in the past month. The more everyone hopes for peace, the more unattainable it seems. The reason for this lies in the fact that everyone has not clearly distinguished between peace talks and surrender in their minds. Therefore, regarding the current situation, we must first discuss: What preparations is the government making for the CCP? Peace? Or Surrender?</p>
<p>What is peace? When both sides of a war feel that military force ultimately cannot solve national affairs, and especially feel that the suffering of the people is too great and cannot continue to sacrifice the people, they resolutely abandon military means and instead use political methods to negotiate all major national plans, in order to reduce the suffering of the people. This is peace. Therefore, the starting points of peace are three: (1) Both sides are entirely thinking of the people; (2) Both sides thoroughly realize that military force cannot be relied upon indefinitely; (3) Both sides recognize each other's equal status.</p>
<p>What is surrender? When one side of a war realizes that it has completely lost its ability to fight, and recognizes the other side as the completely victorious conqueror, it lays down its arms and submits to all of the other side's commands, without considering what impact the result will have on the people. This is surrender. Therefore, the starting points of surrender are also three: (1) Not truly thinking of the people; (2) Due to military defeat; (3) Voluntarily abandoning its equal status.</p>
<p>Being clear about this, we can examine why comprehensive peace is currently attainable but still out of reach. The reason is that the three starting points of peace do not seem to be fully present. Because they are not present, peace clearly still faces obstacles. We only need to review the following series of facts to understand: (1) President Chiang's New Year's Day message advocated peace, pointed out five principles of peace, and stated that his personal position was not a concern, filling the people of the entire country with joy, believing that the dawn of peace had appeared. (2) However, after two weeks, the CCP broadcast Mr. Mao Zedong's eight conditions for peace talks, including "punishing war criminals," on January 14, and the dawn seemed to be obscured again. (3) On the 19th, the Executive Yuan hoped that both sides would immediately cease fire and send representatives to conduct peace talks. (4) On the 21st, President Chiang resolutely "stepped down first, in the hope of ending the war," with Vice President Li acting on his behalf to continue seeking peace. (5) On the 22nd, the government appointed Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and three others as representatives to await the CCP's response regarding the dispatch of representatives and the designated location. (6) On the 22nd, Acting President Li also issued a message, "Seeking the realization of peace with the highest sincerity and greatest effort." He also issued an edict deciding to implement seven measures, including abolishing the Special Criminal Tribunal and releasing political prisoners, to show sincerity in seeking peace. (7) However, on the 25th, the CCP broadcast criticized the government's pursuit of peace as hypocritical, and said that the number of "war criminals" was not limited to forty-three. On the 26th, the CCP broadcast added many more "war criminals," and demanded that the government arrest them first. (8) On the 27th, Acting President Li still telegraphed Mr. Mao Zedong, appealing for the people, and acknowledging that the CCP's eight conditions could be used as the basis for peace talks. Logically, since Mr. Mao had previously said that "the Kuomintang should abandon its 'reactionary' conditions and acknowledge the eight conditions proposed by the Chinese Communist Party as the basis for both sides to engage in peace talks," the CCP should have designated representatives to conduct peace talks with the government after Acting President Li telegraphed acknowledging this as the basis. (9) However, the CCP broadcast a statement on the 29th, emphasizing that the immediate arrest of the "war criminals" by name was a prerequisite (these forty-three people included Acting President Li and President Sun himself), and that "liquidation" and "struggle" must be carried out. But it never mentioned designating representatives. (10) On the first, the government replied to the CCP's statement, still hoping that the CCP would also use the highest sincerity to promote the early opening of peace talks. Acting President Li also flew to Shanghai on the same day, inviting Dr. Yan Huiqing and four others to go to Peiping in a private capacity to inquire about the CCP's intentions, but to this day, the CCP has not shown any indication of sending representatives, and the five representatives in Shanghai have not flown to Peiping, while the trip to Peiping by the Nanjing people's representatives has already been turned away in Qingdao.</p>
<p>Based on the above description of facts, the reader should know that the obstacle to peace lies in the CCP's self-perception as the complete conqueror. If this idea is allowed to develop, the CCP will no longer consider the suffering of the people from the war, and will be confident that its military force can unify China, and will not need to treat the National Government led by Acting President Li as an equal. If this idea is allowed to develop, in the CCP's eyes, Acting President Li is no better than Okamura Neiji. Because when Okamura Neiji, on the orders of the Japanese Emperor, led his imperial army in China to surrender, he did not first arrest himself or offer his own head to pay homage to our receiving officer.</p>
<p>We believe that after President Chiang retreated to his rural home, Acting President Li continued his ambition, leading the people in striving for peace, not surrender. We further hope that the CCP leaders will see this clearly, accept Acting President Li's sincerity, and seek the realization of comprehensive peace. If the CCP does not do this, and insists on playing out a "surrender" ceremony, then we, the common people, deeply fear that the government may not be willing to surrender, and the people will suffer from the war again due to the CCP's mistake, and be trapped in an irrecoverable situation.</p>
<p>On the government's side, if it is willing to surrender regardless of the future harm to the people, then so be it. Otherwise, it should do its best to seek equal peace. So how can equal peace be achieved? Simply put: First, earnestly unite internally; second, fully defend the Yangtze River; third, thoroughly clarify politics and resolve to start anew with the people; fourth, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and stabilize social order. At least it must be done in this earnest, practical, and hard-working way, so that the military and the people can cooperate, restore its own strong power, show people that it cannot be easily humiliated, can fight without having to fight, and then engage in peace, and only then can equal and genuine peace be achieved. Otherwise, it's just surrender, what peace is there to speak of?</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Taipei, 3rd] Economic Cooperation Administration Director Robert Smith, along with Deputy Director Griffin and industrial economics experts Green and Johnston, arrived in Taiwan on a special plane at approximately 11:00 AM this morning. Secretary-General Pu, Director Yan, and the American Consul-General all went to the airport to greet them. Smith and others are here to inspect the Keelung Port fertilizer factory and the electricity project, and are scheduled to return to Shanghai on Sunday.</p>
<p>[City News] A spokesman for the Economic Cooperation Administration's China Mission said on the 3rd that the Peiping office has indeed been ordered to close, a decision made locally by office director Davis. The situation at the Tianjin office is unclear; communication has been cut off since Communist forces occupied Tianjin on January 22.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 3rd] The Economic Cooperation Administration's Peiping office received an order from the Shanghai headquarters yesterday to close immediately; the reason was not stated. Office Director Davis informed staff that this month's salary would be paid on the 4th, at which time Shanghai plans to send a plane to Peiping to evacuate personnel who wish to leave Peiping. Foreigners believe that the closure order was likely issued from Washington. According to visitors from Tianjin, ECA materials in the city have been seized by Communist forces and distributed without the agency's consent. The closure of the Peiping office may be motivated by this. The ECA plane still requires the permission of the Communist authorities to come to Peiping.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] Official sources said today that the Communist authorities' confiscation of Economic Cooperation Administration grain reserves in Peiping and Tianjin is likely to affect American relief activities in other parts of China. It is reported that the Communist forces will receive 150,000 bags of flour from the Tianjin ECA, the same amount as in Peiping. Economic Cooperation Administration's China Mission Director Robert Smith has not yet made any statement regarding the future direction of relief efforts.</p>
<p>[United Press, Taipei, 3rd] Economic Cooperation Administration's Taiwan Mission Director Craig told a United Press reporter today that although the situation on the Chinese mainland is turbulent, the agency's programs in Taiwan have increased rather than decreased. The original plan did not include water conservancy and afforestation, but these have now been added, and surveying will begin as soon as surveying personnel arrive. The fertilizer and railway programs are still in the preliminary investigation stage, while practical work has already begun on the electricity project. The Economic Cooperation Administration's industrial department may establish a factory in Taiwan, and it is expected that the engineering team from American Widell Company and the Sino-American Joint Railway Committee will arrive in Taiwan soon.</p>

<p>[Our Paper Report] According to this question ECA news: Dr. James Yen, a member of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, made the following remarks yesterday on the New Rural Village Improvement Program in the Third District of Sichuan Province, which is supported by the Commission: "The interest of the people has been aroused. This plan is not being imposed on the local people from the outside. The local people need this plan. Basic techniques for improving rural villages have begun to be developed. Local leaders are also being trained." American member Morris Earl said, "Experience has shown that a complete plan is necessary for truly improving people's lives." The basic work of the Rural Reconstruction Commission is to "cooperate with existing institutions to establish a concept of what should be done to improve rural villages, and to establish necessary institutions to implement it." Like the Commission's other projects, the Third District project will not end when its current work is completed. Based on this plan, the Commission will establish a fund to continue implementing the rural village plan in Sichuan Province. The fund will be used to lend to or assist various projects, and its source will be the repayment of loans from the Commission or the fund by the people.</p>
<p>[City News] A comprehensive plan to improve the lives of five million Chinese farmers in the Third District of Sichuan Province has begun with the support of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction. This plan improves rural villages in a comprehensive way, rather than in a piecemeal way. This plan will focus on the five main goals of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, namely agriculture, farmland leasing, local autonomy, administration, health care, and adult social education. The Mass Education Movement has laid a foundation for this plan, because the Mass Education Movement engaged in a plan after the war. The Third District is adjacent to Chongqing and includes ten counties and one special zone. The new plan will begin work in this area where experiments have been carried out. With the joint efforts of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction and the local area, the following plans will be possible: (1) Establish two hundred new production cooperatives to solve the problem of agricultural tenancy. (2) Educate more than 1.9 million illiterate adults and out-of-school children in the Third District. (3) Protect and improve the health of the people in the Third District. (4) Assist the textile cooperative movement to grow in Bishan County. (5) Open up small irrigation areas. (6) Increase the number of livestock in the area.</p>

The rice market has slightly opened to supply the local market, with white japonica rice at 3,500 yuan. Most stores in various industries have not opened due to the impact of the price increase.</p>
<p>Hangzhou [Our Paper, 3rd] The lack of Shanghai newspapers for two days in Hangzhou due to vehicle allocation problems has gradually made people feel uneasy. Most shops have not opened, and prices have risen sharply, especially rice and cigarettes, with everything rising by 100 to 200 percent. Also, the order in many places in Hangzhou is chaotic, especially the city station and its surrounding areas. Merchants and residents generally feel uneasy, and three-quarters of the stores have not yet opened. The city chamber of commerce has petitioned Chairman Chen, requesting that order be restored quickly so that stores can open and people's minds can be stabilized. The provincial government is working to settle the transit troops.</p>
<p>Hankou [Our Paper, 3rd] Rumors here have subsided, people's minds have stabilized, and stores throughout the city have officially reopened. The silver dollar dealers who were originally scheduled to be executed today have had their executions postponed. Also, the newspapers here have resumed publication today, with prices increased tenfold, with broadsheets at 50 yuan and quarto sheets at 40 yuan. The New Hubei Daily has permanently ceased publication due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Guilin [Our Paper, 3rd] Starting this month, provincial civil servants will be allocated one dan of rice per person. Also, the market has gradually stabilized after the city government sent police to order each household to open for business. After the arrest of four people who were buying and selling silver dollars and raising prices, the black market has subsided, and prices have fallen, with silver dollars falling to 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Chengdu [Our Paper, 3rd] In order to meet actual needs, the Sichuan authorities have decided to plan to issue small-denomination local circulation certificates. The Chengdu nickel tide is being manipulated by a large organization. Small notes of ten yuan or less have been seized, and false notices have been posted everywhere in the name of the police bureau, forcing the market to use them tenfold, causing prices to rise sharply. The provincial government has now obtained clues.</p>
<p>Guangzhou [Our Paper, 3rd] Due to the relocation of various central government agencies to the south, large amounts of Gold Yuan Certificates have flowed into the Guangzhou market, and are immediately exchanged for Hong Kong dollars in order to maintain the value of the currency, causing a major financial upheaval. The black market for Hong Kong dollars has suddenly doubled in three days, reaching a high of breaking two passes, and has now fallen back to 1.5. Chairman Xue has reported to Nanjing, requesting that a senior official be sent quickly to curb this situation.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Secretary of State Acheson Issues Statement: US Refuses to Negotiate Separately with the Soviets, Accuses Stalin of Manipulating International Politics; If the Soviets are Sincere, They Can Follow Normal Channels for Resolution <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Acheson accused Premier Stalin of using the suggestion to meet with President Truman and sign a non-aggression pact to manipulate international politics with peace. Acheson stated that the world's interest in peace is fundamental, and this matter cannot be falsified, nor can it be a tool for any international political means. The United States will not use peace in such a way. Previously, the White House stated that President Truman had not received a formal telegram from Stalin, but Truman still maintained his original stance, saying that he was prepared and willing to meet with Stalin in Washington. Acheson stated in a one-hour press conference that if Stalin truly wished to discuss peace with Truman, he could proceed through official channels, without going through the press. Acheson's statement is the first official US response to Stalin's proposal. Acheson pointed out the following points: First, all normal diplomatic channels between the United States and the Soviet Union remain open, and this matter can be handled through these channels. Second, he believes that it would be unhelpful for the US President to travel halfway around the world for the fourth time to meet with Stalin to discuss intangible issues. Third, the United States is unwilling to negotiate separately with any country on any matter involving the interests of other countries, unless these countries are also invited to participate. Fourth, Acheson lamented that the Soviet Union often took obstructive actions in the United Nations in reaching agreements on atomic energy control, world disarmament, and the establishment of an international police force. Fifth, Acheson declared that the Soviet Union's use of the veto in United Nations conferences has undermined the purpose of the United Nations Charter in peacefully resolving various disputes. Sixth, Stalin had carefully expressed his willingness to conclude a US-Soviet peace treaty, which Acheson has rejected. Acheson declared that when the United States and the Soviet Union signed the United Nations Charter, they had already mutually agreed never to engage in war. Seventh, Acheson reiterated Truman's claim during his inauguration that the United States consistently upholds the United Nations. Acheson stated that Truman "was not saying that he was prepared to consider making this claim, but he has already stated this claim clearly."</p>
<h3 id="e39">US Government Clarifies Firm Stance: Doubts of Western European Countries Fully Dispelled; Hope to Complete the Atlantic Pact Soon <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 3rd] After the United States reassured that there would be no Stalin-Truman meeting to end the Cold War, Western European countries were relieved. While feeling bewildered by Stalin's statement of willingness to talk peace with Truman, Western figures were very suspicious of the Soviet Union's "spring peace offensive" and any private negotiations arising from it. Secretary of State Acheson's outright rejection of Stalin's proposal cleared away all existing worries. British officials, among others, were most outspoken, denouncing Stalin's proposal as pure propaganda. Prime Minister Attlee plans to tell questioners in Parliament on the 3rd that he rejects all suggestions to have Britain facilitate a Truman-Stalin meeting.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] French Premier Queuille said today at a banquet for British and American journalists that if Truman and Stalin were willing to meet on French territory, France would welcome it. Queuille stated that Stalin should now clearly declare his true intentions, and if the purpose of the talks is to lay the foundation for world peace, then we are willing to unanimously agree and welcome reaching an understanding. France is willing to work with other relevant major powers to eliminate the threat of war, provided that both sides can express equal sincerity.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 2nd] Stalin's "paper talks" with the United States have spurred Western European countries to speed up the completion of the Atlantic Security Pact. It is generally believed that completing the pact as soon as possible will strengthen the West's power to resist this pressure. The Western reaction has generally been skeptical, but there is also an underlying hope that the leaders of the world's two largest countries might agree to a truce in the "Cold War"? Western figures here explain that the influence of the Atlantic bloc, backed by potentially $2 billion worth of US equipment, is clearly far beyond any diplomatic and political measures related to the "Cold War." If the pact is completed, it can give Truman the support of a strong Atlantic alliance. In any potential talks with Stalin, he will have more room for bargaining.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 3rd] Soviet Communist Party Secretary Pospelov stated at the party's conference on the 3rd that the British and American ruling classes are attempting to establish world domination by force. He stated, "They have entered an aggressive stage of launching a new war. These countries are breaking their agreements. The instigators of Anglo-American aggressive policies do not need agreements for cooperation with the Soviet Union, only empty talk of agreements and cooperation. They are worried that cooperation and agreements with the Soviet Union will dispel their aggressive warmongering policies." He continued, "The war preparations of the ruling classes of American imperialism and European capitalist countries are becoming increasingly open."</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 3rd] Soviet newspapers and radio stations today published Stalin's second statement from yesterday, but did not mention Secretary of State Acheson's response. The newspapers also competed to publish foreign reactions to Stalin's first statement. One telegram stated that Stalin's talk completely disrupted the imperialist ranks.

However, because new ships are being built, the actual number of reductions will be 24. Most of the weakened parts are mostly on the West Coast or in the Pacific region. The US Navy has shifted its focus from emphasizing the Pacific fleet to emphasizing the Atlantic Fleet, which provides further proof.</p>

The 1,000 troops currently invading the US-occupied area southward have 2,000 reserve troops, but the latter are still stationed north of the 38th parallel. They also stated: This military action is definitely not the nature of a guerrilla raid and will inevitably be the start of a civil war between North and South, and it is also an international conflict.

<h3 id="e51">Temporary Suspension of Free Trading of Rice; Limited Purchase of One Dou Per Person with Certificate; Mayor Wu Decides on Emergency Measures to Stabilize Grain Prices; Price Per Dan Not to Exceed 4,800 <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] After the Lunar New Year holiday, the price of rice has been soaring wildly in recent days. The municipal government, considering that the price of rice directly affects general prices, has decided to use high-pressure means to suppress this unreasonable phenomenon. Mayor Wu convened representatives of rice merchants in the city at the municipal government conference room at 5 pm yesterday to discuss emergency measures to suppress rice prices. The following measures were agreed upon jointly: Starting today, the Ministry of Food will allocate 5,000 dan of white japonica rice daily to supply to the city. At the same time, each rice merchant is required to be responsible for supplying 5,000 zu (white japonica) to the market daily. Citizens can use the purchase certificates No. 5 and No. 6 attached to their national identity cards to buy rice from rice stores. Each certificate is limited to buying five sheng, totaling one dou, calculated as 15 jin. The wholesale price per dan is 4,500 yuan, and the retail price is stipulated not to exceed 4,800 yuan. Starting today (the 4th), citizens can use purchase certificate No. 6 to buy five sheng of rice sold by rice merchants from rice stores. Purchase certificate No. 5 will only be allowed to be purchased starting tomorrow (the 5th).</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said when he met with reporters at 6 pm yesterday: Free trading of rice will be completely suspended from today. He has ordered that all rice transactions in the market yesterday will be invalidated and will only be allowed to resume trading after the rice price falls back to a reasonable price.</p>
<p>According to Wu, the rice demand of the city's citizens is two dou per person per month. The household rice has supplied one dou, and now they can buy one dou with a purchase certificate. He believes that the people's food this month is no longer a concern, and the rice price will definitely return to normal.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Domestic Coal Sources Cut Off; Relying Only on Foreign Coal to Maintain; Fuel Panic Becomes More Severe <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>According to the Joint Office of the Kailuan, East China, Huainan, and Taiwan Coal Mines: Amid the coal shortage, the lack of fuel coal this month will be even more severe. The main reason is still that the source of coal cannot be increased. The Kailuan, East China, and Huainan coal mines, which are domestic coal sources, have all fallen into war zones, and only the Hebei Coal Mine has a slight amount of fuel coal coming in. In January of this year, only 30,000 tons of Taiwanese coal were shipped, and at most, only 30,000 tons can be shipped this month. In addition to domestic coal, foreign coal is the main source. The coal used by various public utilities in the city last month was entirely maintained by foreign coal imports. Only 30,000 tons of Soviet coal can be shipped in this month, and 5,000 tons of American coal can be shipped. There is no other source. The total amount of coal sources this month is only 65,000 tons, while the most essential demand in this city this month is more than 100,000 tons, which is still short by about 30,000 tons. The Coal Ash Association and the relevant departments are currently gathering for this.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Middle School Principals Discuss Tuition Issues: High School 1.5 Shi, Junior High School 1.2 Shi; Principle Decided to Collect Fees Once; School Opening Date Determined by Each School <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issue of tuition fees for public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, the Education Bureau previously sent a letter to the Municipal Council asking it to select a date to convene councilors and education figures, representatives of principals and teachers from public and private schools, etc., to discuss together. Now that the school opening is approaching, a meeting will be held soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the principals of municipal middle schools held a symposium at the Pudong Native Place Association. Director Li of the Education Bureau also attended. Regarding the issue of fees, the principals decided to submit the resolution standard of the previous principals' meeting, that is, 1.5 shi for high school and 1.2 shi for junior high school, to the authorities for final approval. In principle, it was decided to collect fees once, but if each school has difficulties, it can be collected in installments. The school opening date was originally set for February 5, but now that various municipal middle schools in the suburbs have garrisons stationed there, each school will decide according to the situation. Director Li of the Education Bureau will visit Garrison Commander Chen Daqing today to urge the withdrawal of troops from the school in order to avoid affecting classes.</p>
<p>Municipal School Teachers Request: Treatment the Same as Private Schools</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the treatment of municipal school teachers, the representatives of municipal middle school teachers requested the same treatment as private school teachers. According to Yuan Zhe, the principal of Yucai Middle School, a municipal school, the treatment of teachers in private schools is, if high school tuition is calculated at 3 shi of rice, the monthly income of teachers should be over 30,000 yuan, while the treatment of municipal middle school teachers is only about 2,000 yuan. Therefore, the morale of municipal school teachers has been shaken, and many tend to transfer to private schools to teach. Therefore, how to achieve a balance between the treatment of private and municipal school teachers is a major issue.</p>
<p>The Municipal Middle School Faculty and Staff Association suggested that the tuition standard for the next semester, in addition to school administrative expenses, should be 1.5 shi of rice for each high school student and 1.25 shi for each junior high school student for academic development fees.</p>

<p>Regarding the rumors that the Export-Import Management Committee has begun to move south to Guangzhou, the person in charge of the committee said yesterday that so far, the committee is still in preparation. Because the committee's business is closely related to the Central Bank, it is difficult for the committee to move south on its own before the Central Bank moves south. Therefore, whether or not the committee moves depends on whether or not the Central Bank moves. As for the committee's Shanghai office, all work is still proceeding as usual and has not been interrupted.</p>

<p>[Our Own Report] With the Special Criminal Court closing soon, it dealt with numerous detention cases yesterday.

<h3 id="e69">Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Passenger Trains Temporarily Suspended Yesterday, Partial Resumption Expected Today <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Taibao News] Passenger transport on both lines is becoming increasingly difficult. All passenger trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line were suspended yesterday afternoon. In the morning, only three trains departed. On the Shanghai-Nanjing line, only four trains departed in the morning. The situation was better in the afternoon. Commuter trains in the Wuxi-Changzhou area continued to operate. A resumption of Shanghai-Hangzhou railway passenger services is expected today. It is reported that the reasons for the significant reduction in passenger train services yesterday and the suspension of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line in the afternoon were: (1) Shortage of train cars; (2) Congestion due to military transport trains, roads in need of urgent repairs; (3) The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway can no longer accommodate refugees and vehicles moving south, requesting the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to reduce southbound trains to a minimum. It is reported that starting today, Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger trains are expected to partially resume. This situation is a normal occurrence when there are too many vehicles on the railway and the train schedules are overly chaotic, which is expected to be difficult to avoid in the future. However, this is by no means a railway interruption or suspension of passenger transport. The new director, Wang Zhaohuai, has guaranteed that he will do his best to maintain passenger transport and will not allow it to be interrupted or suspended.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Due to the reduction in passenger trains, revenue on both lines has plummeted. Yesterday, Shanghai Station only collected over 200,000 in ticket revenue, which was barely enough to pay for coal. Shanghai Station's revenue accounts for half of the entire revenue of both lines. As a result, the economies of both lines have fallen into extremely difficult situations.</p>

<p>Team Leader Mao Sen Arrives in Shanghai to Organize</p>
<p>In light of the recent proximity of the war zone and the frequent movement of troops passing through the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, the Shanghai-Nanjing Garrison Command has noted that it is easy for undisciplined soldiers and illegal elements to mix in, arbitrarily causing disturbances. There have been frequent incidents of soldiers interfering with train operations and beating railway staff, causing the traffic order on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines to become increasingly chaotic, which seriously affects traffic safety and damages military discipline. Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo and Director Wang Zhaohuai of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration have discussed the matter and decided that, in addition to strengthening the military police escorting trains starting immediately, a military law enforcement patrol will be formed, led by Mao Sen, Director of the Second Division of the Command, to regularly dispatch personnel to rectify traffic order on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines and the military discipline of soldiers from various units. Mr. Mao arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is actively consulting with the two railway administrations on organizational matters. It is expected that the patrol will be formally established and deployed to carry out its mission within days. After the team is established, it will, in accordance with the emergency military laws promulgated by the Ministry of National Defense, execute on the spot without leniency any unlawful soldiers who interfere with the duties of stationmasters, disrupt traffic order, detain locomotives, or use military vehicles to transport private goods, in order to ensure the safety of traffic on both railway lines.</p>

A Shanghai News reporter obtained the original order from the Ministry of Justice in a certain judicial agency in the city yesterday. According to the order, prisoners sentenced to less than ten years for corruption, transportation, sale, cultivation, manufacture, and open sale and consumption of opium, as well as those who violated the National General Mobilization Law during the period of suppression of rebellion, are not eligible for evacuation. Although the work of finding guarantors for these prisoners has already begun, the date of their release on bail will still depend on when necessary conditions are met.</p>

<p>[Our Own Report] No. 26, Lane 483, Madang Road, is the residence of Cui Xichen, a police officer No. 4552 of the Lujiawan Police Station. At around 7:00 PM the night before last, Cui was out, when several robbers broke in, pulled out firearms, and threatened his family members. In addition to stealing three gold rings, they also stole Cui's official pistol from under his pillow, along with six bullets. The family of Yang Amao, a tenant on the second floor, was also robbed clean. They were robbed of three gold thread rings, one large and one small square ring, two pairs of round and flat gold bracelets, four gold circles, three small gold bars weighing two liang and nine qian and eight fen, and 2400 yuan in gold yuan notes. When the robbers fled with the stolen goods, Cui's family members chased them relentlessly, shouting "Robbers!" The robbers fired a warning shot, and a stray bullet hit the back of the head of Wu Wenbin, a child of neighbor No. 433. He fell to the ground after being injured. The robbers took the opportunity to escape. After receiving the report, the Songshan Road Police Sub-bureau immediately ordered a large number of police officers to rush to the scene to surround and arrest the robbers, but the robbers were nowhere to be found.

<p>[Our Own Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chuan, carrying the families of the victims of the sunken Taiping Steamer, set off for the waters off Baijie Mountain at noon on the 31st of last month to explore. The ship arrived near Maji Mountain at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 1st and anchored. Representatives of the victims' families landed to explore, but found nothing. Only broken chests and photos were recovered from the ocean. After returning to the ship, another eight representatives hired a sailboat to search the waters near Huanglong Sijiao Mountain. According to a telegram from the Hai Chuan yesterday, the eight representatives returned to the ship yesterday and requested to continue searching. Therefore, the ship departed from Maji Mountain for Lower Three Star Lamp Mountain. It is expected to return to Shanghai this weekend.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding the aftermath of the Taiping Steamer accident, the victims' families have elected representatives to form an aftermath committee.

<h3 id="e87">Safe Deposit Box Business at Various Banks Gradually Improving <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>According to the Custody Division of the Trust Department of the Bank of China, the establishment of safe deposit boxes is the most important security guarantee for banking business, and its value is even more important during turbulent times.</p>
<p>Currently, the banks with safe deposit boxes are: Bank of China on the Bund with 12,000 boxes (93 percent rented), Bank of China in Hongkou with 2,000 boxes, Bank of China branch in Jing'an Temple with 2,000 boxes, Four Banks Trust Department with 5,000 boxes, and Shanghai Bank with 6,000 boxes. The above are larger in scale.</p>
<p>From January of last year until before the price freeze, speculative trading in gold, banknotes on the black market, and stocks used bank safe deposit boxes to evade inspection by the authorities, resulting in an extremely abnormal prosperity in the business. Since the price freeze, it has returned to a normal state.</p>
<p>The Bank of China (Bund) safe deposit box is the largest and most solid in the Far East. The Philippine National Bank safe deposit box in Pearl Harbor was destroyed before the war. The Bank of China's equipment has 12,000 safe deposit boxes. The construction cost (300,000 US dollars in 1937) was high. The entire vault is located on the lower ground floor. The destructive power of the latest weapon, the atomic bomb, can incinerate buildings, but cannot damage a vault located on the lower ground floor with no air supply for the uranium inside the atomic bomb to explode, and with several layers of steel plates. This point is unique to our country among the new storage facilities in the banking industry of various countries, and it can also be called a glorious place.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Shen Qier, a teacher at the Liuyun Elementary School on Fusantang Street in this city and a disgrace to the teaching profession, was charged with raping a female student surnamed Dai. Judge Cao Zuwei of the District Court continued the trial yesterday morning. The defendant is at large. Tong Muge, the school principal, and Chen Shanchang, the director of administration, were summoned to court as the other two defendants. Dai Yunsu, the mother of the victimized student, brought her daughter to the court and tearfully recounted the ordeal, along with a civil suit demanding 710,000 yuan in compensation from the defendants. Tong Muge claimed complete ignorance of the principal offender's bestial conduct and expressed a willingness, out of moral obligation, to find Shen and bring him to justice, as Shen is currently at large. After closing arguments by both parties' lawyers, the court announced that a verdict would be delivered on the morning of the tenth of this month. It is reported that in this case, the principal offender, Shen Qier, was advised by Tong and Chen for several days after the incident to dissuade Dai's mother from reporting to the police, and they attempted mediation, during which Shen fled without a trace. The prosecutor, considering Tong and Chen difficult to exonerate, indicted them as well.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Six District Cotton Textile Trade Associations Plead: Waive Restrictions on Southern Transport of Yarn and Cloth; Minister of Industry and Commerce Agrees to Consider <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the newspaper reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce would reinstate restrictions on the southern transport of yarn and cloth in order to suppress market prices, the Six District Cotton Textile Trade Associations believe that the soaring prices of various commodities since the reopening of business after the Spring Festival are primarily due to financial factors and the increase in general production costs. The past implementation of restrictions or the suspension of southern transport of yarn and cloth not only failed to suppress market prices but also caused panic among the people of South China regarding clothing. Furthermore, the sales area for yarn and cloth in Shanghai has been shrinking recently. Restricting the only remaining market in South China would choke off the vitality of factories and leave over 200,000 cotton textile workers on the brink of destitution, with profound and significant consequences. It is reported that the standing directors of the association, along with Secretary-General Wang Zhuyi and others, paid a visit to Minister Liu of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday morning to personally present the actual difficulties faced by the cotton textile industry. They requested that the restrictions on the southern transport of yarn and cloth be waived to ensure the well-being of the people and alleviate business difficulties. Minister Liu reportedly indicated that the southern transport of yarn and cloth would be temporarily registered, and that the request to completely waive restrictions would be considered.</p>

Those present included Xu Jiyi, Li Fuxun, Shou Miancheng, Gu Chunfan, and over ten others, chaired by Governor Liu Gongyun.

<h3 id="e93">Relaxed Monetary Conditions Unabated: Large-Scale Return of Cash <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, monetary conditions in the city remained relaxed and unabated. The main reason is that financial authorities were unable to contract the money supply. It is said that after the situation in North China changed, a large amount of gold yuan flowed south, further exacerbating the currency glut in the city. Although market demand is sluggish, the supply is even more abundant, and the practice of short-term borrowing has reappeared. The overnight interest rate is around 30 yuan, with rates as low as 25 yuan available, even below the interest rates owed by banks and firms. It is widely believed that the future trend of monetary conditions is uncontrollable and the prospects for prices are worrisome.</p>
<p>Cash was unusually abundant yesterday, with banks and firms no longer having withdrawal limits. However, the cash being paid out was all old banknotes tied with rope, indicating the recent return of currency. Promissory notes have decreased significantly in recent days, and discounts have disappeared.</p>

<p>The market for foreign exchange transfer certificates (on the 3rd) saw another surge in prices. Opening in the morning, it immediately set a new record of 500 yuan, then continued to rise. Exporters were waiting for higher prices and unwilling to sell, resulting in a closing price of 620 yuan. The exchange rate for overseas remittances was also adjusted to 500 yuan on the 3rd, an increase of 100 yuan.</p>
<p>(5) The CCP may adopt considerable "hypocritical gestures" at the beginning of controlling newspapers and restricting personal freedom to win over or prevent free people and intellectuals from becoming alienated, and to prevent opposition from democratic forces abroad.</p>
<p>(6) All government ministries and agencies will be reorganized starting from the highest level, but many low-level Kuomintang officials will remain in their posts because the CCP lacks administrative and technical personnel.</p>
<p>(7) Improving transportation and the domestic economy. During the civil war, the Communist army destroyed railways and blockaded waterways. After the war ends, these will be gradually restored, and domestic trade will also gradually recover.</p>
<p>The speed and extent of these changes will depend on the following two factors:</p>
<p>(1) Whether President Chiang or any Kuomintang leaders attempt to continue resistance against the CCP in China or in the form of a foreign government in exile.</p>
<p>(2) The consequences of the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to continue influencing China.</p>

<p>The China Textile Corporation distributed a large quantity of goods yesterday, totaling 22,300 bolts of cloth and 110,000 pounds of yarn, for a total of 140,681,000 gold yuan. There were eighteen types of cloth available. The assessed prices were: Dragon Head Fine Cloth 6,000 yuan, Special B 11-pound Fine Twill 5,500 yuan, Deputy Brand 29 1/2G Serge Gray 5,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen Serge 6,500 yuan, Four Gentlemen Yuangong Ni 6,800 yuan, Gentleman B 42G Bleached Cloth 6,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen 9029 Printed Serge 6,200 yuan, Four Gentlemen 9034 and 9035 6,200 yuan, Second-Grade Printed Serge 5,400 yuan, Second-Grade Printed Straight Gong 5,400 yuan, Second-Grade Printed Xiaosha 4,600 yuan, Second-Grade Printed Cloth 4,300 yuan, Hongguang Fine Yuangong Satin 5,800 yuan, Jumping Carp Yuanguang 4,000 yuan, Three Beauties 1017, 1110, 1113 Flower Poplin 5,000 yuan. As for cotton yarn, none was dumped yesterday.</p>
<p>Also, market conditions for cotton yarn rose sharply yesterday. Authorities temporarily suspended yarn dumping, boosting confidence. Surplus capital from within and outside the industry flooded the market, driving prices to new heights. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at a high of 240,000 yuan in the morning. The market was very active, and prices continued to rise, reaching a new price of 300,000 yuan. It fell slightly near the close, ending at 290,000 yuan, up 80,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse initially traded at 175,000 yuan. It was sold off at high prices mid-session, and the rising trend fluctuated. By the close, it was still pushing toward a new high, closing at 180,000 yuan, also up 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The rising trend for cotton cloth remained very strong. After the restrictions on southern transport, it was reported that customs could still ship it out, so Guangdong merchants were vigorously searching for it, with retail investors following suit, and new highs emerged repeatedly. Four Gentlemen Yuangong Serge opened in the morning, exceeding the 5,000 yuan mark, opening at 5,200 yuan. The market was filled with buying interest, and it rose again and again. By 10:45, it reached a new high of 6,650 yuan. It fell slightly near the close, ending at 6,500 yuan at the noon close, up 1,750 yuan from the previous day's close. Leifeng Pagoda Yuangong Serge traded at 6,200 yuan. Mid-range fine cloths hovered around 5,600 yuan. Colored cloth continued to rise, with Dragon Head Fine Cloth quoted at 7,000 yuan off-market, up 2,000 yuan. Industry insiders frequently sold at high prices. Although the asking price was high near the close, trading became sparse.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Silk Continues to Rise <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for rayon continued to rise, with relaxed capital within the industry, rising prices for all commodities outside the industry, and heightened sentiment, leading to soaring prices. When the Tianqiao 120 opened, it was reported that foreign exchange certificates were rising sharply and the black market for gold notes remained strong. The market was quite brisk, with a high price of 200,000 yuan quoted. New buyers emerged immediately. Seeing that the fundamentals were still strong, dealers repeatedly raised their prices, and the buying interest remained strong. The market continued to rise, reaching a high of 240,000 yuan by noon, a sharp increase of 80,000 yuan. The market heard that gold prices were also good, and the momentum continued to strengthen. However, asking prices varied, and trading was not very active.</p>
<p>The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk continued to rise. Confidence within the industry was optimistic. Moreover, with the simultaneous rise of all commodities outside the industry, the market followed suit. High-grade Another Load was quoted at 240,000 yuan in the morning, with supply available. Then, it was reported that rayon was rising sharply and yarn and cloth were soaring, and sentiment became strong again. The market improved, and trading prices rose another 20,000 yuan. At the noon close, ordinary Another Load was 235,000 yuan. No trading was reported for other grades.</p>
<p>The silk and satin market yesterday saw a surge in prices for raw silk and rayon and a general rise in commodity prices outside the circle, which caused a strong buying spree in the market and a firm mood among investors. The high opening price for Meiya quilt covers in the morning was 135,000 yuan. After jobbers offered high prices, the market fell into consolidation, but because of the easy money policy, it was difficult to stop the upward trend, and quotes jumped to 140,000. In the afternoon, however, the appetite faded a little, and the market closed at 142,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Taiwan Sugar Soars <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Sugar prices had previously been down on news of Taiwan Sugar distributions and the announcement that the authorities would dump stocks on the market. The price was therefore uninspired. Yesterday, however, prices outside the circle were up, and there was a general slackening of money supply within the industry, which boosted demand. The price of Number 45 White Refined sugar opened strong at 95,000 yuan in the morning, then jumped to 100,000 yuan, and finally closed at 103,000, for a surge of 19,000 yuan. All other grades were up by at least twenty percent.</p>

<p>The rice market continues to be extremely strong due to the high prices of silver dollars and gold, and general market sentiment is extremely agitated. Further, with the prices of almost all goods outside of the rice market rising, blocked transport, and very limited arrivals, rice merchants are doing all they can to raise prices. The opening increases were modest, with rice prices rising by five or six hundred yuan. Later, however, prices rose sharply, in part because money supply is unrestrictive and rice shops report healthy demand amid limited supply. This morning there were a few samples offered for sale, but in the afternoon, there were very few samples on offer and prices were fluctuating wildly. White keng rice in the northern market rose to 5,800 yuan, a sharp increase of 1,400 yuan. Early thin rice crops rose by more than 30 percent across the board. White keng thin rice in the southern market was traded at 5,500 yuan, up 1,300 yuan. Prices continued to rise after the close. Thin rice was last quoted at 6,000 yuan. The two markets together saw arrivals of 4,014 piculs.</p>
<p>The rising trend for flour has started fiercely and the atmosphere is strong and exuberant. In the first part of the morning, the price of flour immediately crossed the 11,000 yuan threshold. Flour traders in the central market took advantage of the high prices to dump their goods. Demand consequently slackened somewhat and prices receded briefly to the 2,000 yuan level. However, after the break, individual traders started snapping it up, and the market rallied again. At close, it changed hands at 2,150 yuan. Old-stock flour sold for as much as 2,260 yuan. Other brands of flour all rose by over fifty percent. Wheat bran followed, rising by over thirty percent, and Fuxin flour closed at 1,495 yuan.</p>
<p>The rally in the price of coarse grains widened. Arrivals of soybeans have been turning scarcer. This is producing a serious shortage on the market, and traders are taking advantage of this opportunity to raise prices. The price of Hankou bean suddenly rose again to over twice its previous price, and today changed hands at 4,000 yuan. Oil plants snapped up the beans, pushing the price through the 4,000 yuan level. Guangdong traders made every effort to acquire groundnuts. Traders in Yangzhou urgently asked for a price of 10,000 yuan, and at close of trade, a price of 9,500 was agreed. The price of sesame was underpinned and was snapped up on the local market; prices were up by an average of more than eighty percent.</p>
<p>The rise in the price of edible oils was intense. Prices have been rising across the board because of the ease with which money can be borrowed and an excited mood among the public. Traders are strenuously raising prices, and the market is short of supply. Few vendors are to be seen, but loud calls from buyers can be heard all around. Only after quite a while, was a first deal done. The prices of soybean oil and unrefined oil rose the most steeply because of the scarcity of stockpiles and arrivals. Oil from mills opened this morning at 27,000, and ended at 29,000, for a steep rise of 11,000, equivalent to over sixty percent. A drum of unrefined oil was 32,000, and they shouted for higher prices but there were no vendors to be seen. Clean unrefined oil from mills was 34,000, up also by over sixty percent. Unrefined rapeseed oil closed at 34,000 yuan, up 8,000. Soybean cakes rose by fifty percent to over 2,000 yuan.</p>
