<h3>首都撤退工作完畢　吳貽芳等組維持會在街頭張貼佈告　鎮江丹陽常州均告撤守</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日下午六時廿分電〕南京政府之撤退工作，業已終畢。飛機塲上空，來往飛機，此起彼落，竟日撤退政府工作人員，直至傍晚，猶能聞及軋軋機聲。行政院秘書長黃少谷，為最後撤退之一人。自今晨起，城內秩序，因軍隊警察撤離，故晨初陷入極度混亂狀態中。暴民及共黨地下工作者，四出活躍，搶刧及槍聲，亦繼之紛起。自總統府，各機關要人住宅，以至商店，均遵彼等之洗刧，市區中之米店，亦為彼等搶刧之對象。商業區店鋪多數打烊。市區至通話時止，未發現共軍蹤跡。上午十一時，街上發現維治會佈告，具名者為金陵女大校長吳貽芳，市參議會議長陳裕光及退役軍官馬青苑。該會組織之義警，下午起，亦在街頭出現，遇有群眾集合，卽向空鳴槍，加以驅散。各處搶刧，幾仍未絕跡，但秩序已較上午略佳。下關車站方面，大火熊熊；水電及電話，均未受影響。袁大頭最高時，曾一元可換金圓券一百萬元，其後下跌至七十萬，傍晚跌至五十萬元。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日下午十時半電〕首都廿三日晨情形混亂，搶刧事件甚多，至中午卽有維持會出現，由馬青苑吳貽芳任正副主委，並由地方防護團出而維持治安，下午城中除偏僻街巷尚有劫掠情事外，主要街道秩序多已恢復。迄晚九時，下關起大火，光華門一帶落砲彈頗多，機塲業經自動破壞，倉庫亦自動爆炸。現共軍仍未入城，電燈電話自來水供應如常，並未間斷，塲內復趨安謐。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿三日電〕李代總統與何院長離南京後，其寓所均被刧。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿三日電〕南京維持會今集會商討維持京市治安問題。此外，僅剩之警察局亦已招集志願人員，組織摩托隊巡邏全市，現城內秩序已漸復正常，美國大使館亦平靜如恒，美僑并未奉令集中，按目前跡象觀察，個人安全似無問題，街頭小販，已拒收金圓券。</p>
<p>另據下關來人談：戰鬥已於上午十時停止，僅國軍後衛部隊，因掩護國軍撤退，尚不時向浦口共軍發砲，但共軍并不還擊。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿三日下午十二時三十分急電〕國軍二十三日開始從西起九江東到揚子江口約長達四百五十哩的江面地區全面撤退。據本日下午抵達南京的消息：一切沿江港埠均已撤退一空，國軍全部撤往杭州及其他華南地區。截至發電時為止，南京在軍事上已成為無人地帶，掩護政府機關撤退的第四十五軍一部亦已離城，共軍則尚未從浦口渡江。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿三日電〕共軍司令部廿三日中午十二時卅分致電此間稱：共軍將於廿四日晨上午七時開始渡江。政治使節已抵達此間，並通知中國銀行及各政府機關，廿四日起開始接收</p>
<p>〔聯合社廿三日本埠訊〕中央航空公司駕駛員馬君，曾在五百呎高空環繞南京城三次，據其報告稱：南京車站及城外沿江一帶大火，列車在燃燒中。江中有政府兵艦一艘繞行，其他或已鑿沉，或在燃燒，但未見砲火，亦無砲聲。大部份損害係國軍破壞隊之工作。空軍飛機均已離開南京。詎首都約七十五里處有政府軍艦二十艘，三艘已着火。據另一駕駛員沙狄報告：自南京迄南二百餘里，途中難民充斥。南京北端今晨黑煙如雲上升，中國航空公司駕駛諾門稱：江陰砲火猛烈，鎮江國軍向南退走，南京鎮江間沿岸碉堡已　無一人。中央航空公司開往機塲之汽車，今晨曾被國軍徵用。憲兵六十人於乘客登機時在旁環立，迨一聲令下，卽全體躍上飛機，乘之來滬。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿三日電〕據鐵路當局今晨之消息：共軍已佔領鎮江及其他京滬鐵路上之丹陽及常州兩城。</p>
<h3>共軍先頭部隊　已抵無錫近郊　城內由工商自衛團維持秩序</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿三日下午十一時三刻電〕共軍竄抵北門外相詎一里之錫澄公路口。政府機關已於日間撤至蘇州，城內秩序尚稱良好，由工商自衛團維持秩序。</p>
<p>〔本報無錫廿三日電〕此間城防部·縣府·團管區·憲一團·保安團隊·路警及一部份正規軍，已於廿三日下午六時全部撤退完畢，警察亦去，故錫地現已成真空。聞共軍先頭部隊已抵近郊。</p>

<h3>接返和使專機　今晨飛青轉平</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央航空公司將於廿四日晨六時派第五三三號專機自滬飛青島轉北平，接載現尚留在北平之政府和平代表團張治中·邵力子等南返，該專機擬於當日飛返上海。</p>
<h3>何院長令各地　嚴防宵小滋事</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿三日電〕何院長應欽，廿一日電令各地方政府及治安機關，加緊維持社會秩序與治安，嚴防宵小滋事，學省府昨已奉到該項電文，原文稱：「為求消弭戰禍，實現和平，自本年元旦以來，一切措施，無一非順從全國人民渴望和平之願望，以國家人民最高利益為前提，委曲求全，苦心謀和，逎共黨雖値和談期間，仍不斷進攻，其所提和平協定，竟類似受降文書，且限期答覆，更形同最後通牒，原件披露報端，軍民同深憤慨，經政府電知代表團，轉告共黨，望其確認人民利益高於一切之原則，對協定基本精神與內容重新考慮，並盼能卽日成立臨時停戰協定，表示雙方謀取真正和平之誠意，乃毛澤東·朱德竟因政府不允接受屈辱條件，已對共軍發佈向政府區域全面進攻之命令，共黨窮兵　武與國家民族為敵，殊堪痛恨，當此時期，所有各地治安與社會秩序，務須加緊維持，嚴密防範宵小乘機滋事，至已實行戒嚴之區域，更應將戒嚴法，重行公佈週知，嚴厲執行。」</p>
<h3>穗實施戒嚴</h3>
<p>【中央社廣州廿三日電】本市自廿三日開始實施執行戒嚴令，每日午後十一時起至翌晨六時實行宵禁，惟輪船火車仍可出入港口</p>
<h3>榕成立戒嚴部　加強後方治安</h3>
<p>〔本報福州廿三日電〕榕綏署奉政院電示注意後方秩序，共度艱難，朱紹良當於廿三日午後如黨政軍首長傳達中央意志，並作指示。又，榕綏署決尅日成立戒嚴司令部，第一二一軍長沈向奎兼司令，加強治安。</p>
<h3>共軍圖孤立上海　有取道皖南抄入浙西窺杭之意　皖中共軍續渡江陷蕪湖</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京廿三日電〕南京及整個長江防線，閃電崩潰後，共軍先鋒正向南及向東加速推進，以圖孤立上海。彼等於攻佔若千城市後，先鋒距離蘇州已僅五十里。如再向東南挺進，不過二百里之路程，卽可抵達嘉興，切斷上海對外之陸上聯繋。蕪湖附近登陸之共軍，已挺進至宣城附近，蕪湖已於今晨失陷。另有一支共軍，在安慶附近渡江後，亦正向東南挺進，似有取道皖南，抄入浙西，進取杭州之意。參加渡江戰役之共軍，陳毅部第二野戰軍，正向東挺進，此外為在蕪湖以南渡江之劉伯誠第三野戰軍之國軍二十至三十萬名，如能迅速逃過共軍之包圍，預料將退守寗波·杭州·南昌一線。長江沿線國軍之總退卻，殆係昨日杭州會議之結果。軍事觀察家預料共軍有暫不進取上海，而逕行進攻南昌·杭州·寗波一線之可能，在共軍得以設立長江下游之供應線以前，一時或不致進攻上海，此項供應線設立之能力，尚待視林彪部大軍推進之程度而定。</p>
<p>〔本報南昌廿三日電〕九江安慶間三百六十華里之江防，前晚被共軍於望江楊灣附近突破，首批渡江共軍約四千，次批八千人。現湖口東流間江防部隊已撤，動向不明，彭澤縣政府亦隨駐軍行動，彭澤及以東地區均無國軍之部隊，湖口至九江間江防，現由八綏區派隊佈防，湖口縣府尚在城內辦公，省府召開之行政會議於昨夜提前結束，沿江縣長均於今晨搭車離省，南昌彭湖電話照常，惟潯京電訊一度中斷。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據可靠方面稱：共軍渡江之第一批部隊，係劉伯誠所部六千人，於十九日黎明前在安慶西南十五公里處之官洲南渡。陳毅所部亦卽緊隨於二十日晨三時在荻港以三萬人登陸，二十日晨六時空軍飛機到達荻港江面，發現過江之大小船隻約三千餘艘，遍江接連，紛紛南渡，此後江陰登陸之共軍，係於廿一日晨向江陰要塞迫近時，要塞司令載戎光卽率部縣白旗相迎。廿一日夜間，鎮江附近共軍登陸。廿二日采石磯共軍登陸。廿三日上午南京下關之東十五華里燕子儀，有小股共軍登陸，至此陳毅所部自荻港至江陰已控有五段地區之南岸橋頭堡陣地。其在荻港及江陰二段入侵共軍，前者深入繁昌，後者迫近無錫。在安慶以上長江北岸共軍劉伯誠所部，聞亦有船隻萬艘，分段渡過共軍數萬，此批共軍正以至德為起點，向江西境浙贛鐵路線深入，其企圖顯為切斷京滬杭國軍主力，與閩粵湘等省之通路，以期與京滬杭地區國軍主力作一決戰。</p>
<h3>京滬路各站情狀　下關站新廈已付之一炬　常州真空鐵路員工他撤</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕鎮江係於昨晨五時淪陷，江蘇省政府所屬之主要人員，均已撤至安全地帶。前晚由南京與上海開出之第十一次，十二次京滬間夜臥重，抵鎮江後，均先後被共軍扣留，丹陽站以北之鐵橋，於昨日清晨已予自動炸毀，鐵路亦經分段破壞，橫林站已發現共軍蹤跡。戚豐堰機車廠與電廠無恙，機廠高廠長振洲率領員工一批，駕駛火車十七輛離戚，一切廠務由吳工程師負責辦理善後及移交事宜，號稱「國門」之首都下關車站之瑰麗新廈，昨日正午發生大火，迄晚仍在延燒中，常州已成真空地帶，鐵路員工大部他撤，站長林孝錦仍坐鎮車站，聽候路局最後命令。京滬線火車昨晨尚能通至常州，下午僅可至無錫，列車照常開駛，上下行旅客，均極擁擠。滬杭線火車各班均按原有行車秩序，準點開出，旅客極度擁擠。京滬間電訊暢通，電訊局長途臺照常工作，兩路局自設之專線亦未中斷，路局籍此隨時與各站聯絡，南京站女接線員仍以平靜，溫和，禮貌，悅耳之調，接發電話。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據京滬區鐵路局上海北站息：京滬線火車自廿二日深晚起卽告中斷，廿三日上午列車猶能通至常州，午後僅售票至無錫。北站授擁滿愁眉苦顏之旅客，彼等均思去鎮江南京等地者，京蘇錫等地來滬之車輛並無規定車班，車上均為軍人軍眷及避難來滬及難民，形色倉皇，秩序混亂。由滬開往蘇錫等地之火車並無把握能於何時抵達。</p>
<p>〔合眾社本市訊〕京滬線上海崑山段區間車，二十三日下午仍有開出，晨間京滬線尚通至常州，數小時後，僅通車至蘇州，最後卽僅通至崑山。</p>
<h3>蘇州搬場忙　車站旅客人山人海</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿三日電〕戰火延及江南後，此間謠諑紛起，民間忙於搬遷，惟大部尚極鎮靜，娛樂塲所仍照常營業，觀前街銀行前均駐有衛兵，以防萬一。東行火車已無班次，車站行李高積，旅客人山人海，秩序紊亂，城內多數機關已積極準備地遷，學校方面召開應變會議，決竭力維持上課，各省校並派代表晉見洪教廳長，要求卽發糧食及應變費，此間迄未聞有槍砲聲，惟晚間九時後，行人絕跡，不免令人稍感緊張。</p>

<p>〔本報黃陂廿三日電〕軍息：平漢路東側長軒嶺以南林彪部大部已東移，該地僅有共軍一個團。現黃陂以北四十華里內無大股共軍。又，集結鄂東麻城·宋埠·黃安之林彪部四十三軍主力一萬五千餘人，今仍在原陣地未動。據南逃難民談：該線共軍刻正搶修鄂東各線公路，並整備服裝，以待安慶以西共軍渡江戰獲逞後，續在武漢外圍發動大攻勢。</p>
<p>〔本報黃陂廿三日電〕孝感情勢已暫趨穩定，幸感以南三　埠站西北廿華里處之蔡家坡，現到有共軍五個團，大部屬第十縱隊。該股共軍卽在本月二日被原駐三　埠一線張淦兵團莫敵師擊潰於花園以西之敗殘部隊，刻正整補中。</p>
<h3>首都作戰略撤退　國軍決繼續奮鬥　政府發言人昨發表談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕政府發言人就國軍撤離首都市，發表談話稱：共產黨此次乘政府對爭取和平，要求停戰，作最後呼籲之際，發動總攻，大舉渡江南犯，致荻港·江陰·揚中等地相繼棄守，首都陷入鉗形攻勢之中。我駐守首都大單，一時處於被動地位，無法發揮高度之戰鬥力量。我統帥估計車事形勢，當前尚未適宜之決議階段。不能不自動從首都作戰略之撤退。且政府原早遷廣州，總署停當，政府各機關留京辦事處自宣一律結束，重回我革命策源地為國家之獨立，人民之自由，繼續奮鬥。共黨之所以以暴力結束和談，擴大戰祝，原由其出賣國家民族，奴役全國人民，具有一貫之國際陰謀。默察全世界人心之向背，爭取民主自由之偉大鬥爭，終必勝利，絕非共黨一時一地之軍事冒險所能挽回其最後之命運。政府確信全國同胞及全體將士，緬懷中華民國締造之艱難，痛心國父陵園重罹浩刧，必將以沉重之心情，大無畏之精神，忠勇奮發，為國家人民作最堅苦之奮鬥，為我革命民眾與革命軍人爭取人格，最後之勝利，必屬於愛國者，而不屬於賣國者，必屬於民主自由主義者，而不屬於獨裁暴力主義者，可斷言也。</p>

<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>求土地問題的澈底解決</h3>
<p>— 蕭錚</p>
<p>我們在成立宣言裏，曾大聲疾呼：「我們顯見明日的中國，在自己的領土上，是統一的，民主的，進步的國家；在世界上，是前進的，建設的，光榮的國家」。并呼籲：「全國的同胞，不分職業，階級，黨派，性別，一致的感悟起來，組織起來，共求土地問題的澈底解決，實現我們願見的新中國」。</p>
<p>我們土地改革者，自始便堅信，人類的殘酷戰爭，是因為沒有完善的土地制度，足夠使人類和平地生存，共同努力克服自然，創造文明，人類誤入歧途，迷信戰爭可以解決生存問題，因此乃有人類數千年互相殘殺的慘痛歷史。我們土地改革者的最高信念，是要用和平手段改革土地制度，創造適於生存的環境，根本消除人類互相鬥爭的觀念，所以我們深信一切社會問題的解決，是要基於「社會正義」和「人格自由」。只有基於「社會正義」和「人格自由」的一切改革，才是真正而合理的改革，才能導致人類和善的合作，創造人類嶄新的歷史。</p>
<p>基於這個基本信念，我們呼籲中國土地制度的改革，先後已達十八年——自民國二十一年中國土地問題研究會·地政學會，以迄今日的中國土地改革協會。我們深悉中國的土地問題，是中國歷代治亂問題的主因。我們曾經苦口婆心，勸諫政府，拿出真誠和勇氣來解決土地。無如言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，一直到去年秋天，我們最後和低要求的農地改革法案，尚遭政府與立法院的歧視和擱置。在朝黨沒有決心和勇氣解決人民最迫切的生存問題——土地問題，他今日　失敗，是當然而不是偶然的。今日中央和若干省市政府當局，雖亦已知要拿土地改革來當口頭禅，但他們仍然是沒有誠意採取行動，他們的失敗，亦顯然要更繼續或更澈底下去的。但另一方面，我們的土地改革呼聲，亦沒有得到社會一般知識份子和在野各黨派的真正接受；有時雖亦有拿土地改革列為政網的，但他們重要的是拿他作為政爭的工具，而不肯拿他作為解決人民問題的真實方針。</p>
<p>我們以為中國今日的經濟基礎，仍舊不脫農業經濟的範疇，土地乃為大多數人的生存基礎，如土地剝削制度——地主制度，仍舊縱容其存在，則只有少數人——地主階級——得到豐衣足食，多數人仍只有在飢餓綫上過着生活，這是大背「社會正義」的。同時在以農業經濟為基礎的社會裏，土地仍然是保障大多數農民生活自由的工具，農民的土地如被剝奪了，他們便將失去「人格自由」的保障。所以我們認為「農地農有」政策，是確實建立在「社會正義」和「人格自由」的雙重基礎上的優良政策，必須各黨派深切的認識，列為共同政網，確實執行。</p>
<p>同時，天然　源是大自然賦予全體人類的寶庫，不應由少數人假借任何名義，予以侵佔剝奪。市區地價是人類社會共同文明的所得，不應由都市的吸血虫——都市地產業者——巧取豪奪。我們認為人人應有適當的生存園地，所以我們亦主張每一家庭應有一塊適當單位的住宅與園地。這些都應是為人民解決生存問題　共同主張，希望謀國者不要再站在某一階層上有所歧視。</p>
<p>中國的苦難是足夠了。如今，有力的黨派和有聲望的社會領袖，統應拿出赤誠來為國家人民設想，他們必須排除一切私見，完全站在「社會正義」和「人格自由」兩大基礎上謀求國是，一切政治的，經濟的，社會的問題，統要拿這兩大基礎來作尺度，來衡量各種改革是否適合這兩大要求。如只顧到「社會正義」而沒有顧到「人格自由」，這是要窒息社會文明，阻礙人類進化的；這是「假平等」。如只顧到「人格自由」而沒有顧到「社會正義」，這是要助長社會動亂，阻礙大眾福利的；這是「假自由」。這兩種基礎如不能兼籌并顧，均不是真正的改革，永久的福利。倘如此而偶然得到和平，亦是「假和平」。社會的進化與動亂仍舊要跟着來的，我們希望今後的謀國者不要再造錯誤。</p>
<p>他們如能本着這兩大基礎，來討論一切實際問題，均可迎刅而解。蓋天下的問題，如能共同尊重「正義」，彼此尊重「自由」，即可獲致一致的永久的真理。我們需要一種符於「社會正義」和「人格自由」的政治制度，經濟制度，和社會制度；負責解決國家問題的當軸，幸加注意。</p>
<p>同時，我們要求全社會人士來共同作這個呼籲，來共同監督着今後的進行。誰違反這個原則，誰便不是真正為國家人民謀永久的福利與和平。</p>
<p>人民的眼睛是雪亮的，我們等着看吧！</p>

<h3>胡適在美招待記者稱　我終可獲得美援　政府決維持自由中國并收復失地</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿二日電〕此間外交觀察家於英官方最近評論英艦四艘在長江被擊案之言論中，可以窺見英政府對於此案抱有息事寗人之傾向，外交部發言人宣佈該案，述及已以訓令致「解放區」之英代表團時，避免用及「抗議」之字樣，僅稱已命英代表與共黨領袖接觸，俾獲允諾，設法避免將來繼續發生此類不幸事件。</p>

<h3>自平近觀湘一軍官　談北平情況　學生多調服兵役</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙廿三日電〕頃有一湘籍少校軍官，甫自平返湘，渠於北平局部和平時留平四月，近始輾轉南下，據談：北平自共黨入城後，情形完全改觀，共黨高級官員衣着舊襤，望之儼然一伙夫，惟每人均帶甚多衛士，市民衣着亦極樸素，年青男女亦均土布舊衣，較富有者為避免暴露身份，更多方設法，裝飾為一窮人模樣，各大學均調自共軍中青年軍入學，原有學生則調服兵役，隨軍南下，謂準備江南解放後從政共黨，加以鄉村田地大半荒蕪，故實行計口授糧，每人僅有一份吃不飽之高粱配給，小菜亦加管制，生活之苦，可以想像。商店照常開門，惟營業清淡，奢侈品無人問津，言論絕對無自由，報紙一律為官方報道。共黨入平後，從未公開殺過一次人，惟失蹤事件甚多，渠所居之集中營，共有國軍官兵萬人，因配給高粱不足裹腹，乃集體鼓噪，要求改善，管理人員告以如有要求可推代表面訴，當即推代表前往，詎代表去後，從此永未回營。外傳共黨配妻并非事實，清算鬥爭亦未見到，惟共黨主張男女平等均須工作，每有妻子分配甲地工厰工作工，夫則調乙地服務，無形中使夫妻分離則為事實。市房雖已呈剝落之狀，亦無人再加修葺，亦不再見有市民營造新居，平各大學教授中甚多所謂民主人士，今亦噤若寒蟬。渠在平四月從未理髮，鬚髯滿面。渠對長沙滿街標語，搖頭嘆惜不止，認為帖標語者應先到北平去看，渠一再聲明并宣誓個人毫無政治立場，所談絕無宣傳作用，如有半句虛構，當遭雷殛，渠本身今後決不再作出外之圖，從此歸隱鄉里，為農終身。最後，渠稱：共黨資源枯竭，宜速戰速決，倘國民黨能痛改前非，真正實行三民主義，齊一步驟，收拾人心，亦非不可挽救。</p>

<h3>法外長許曼切實表示　決不容德重披武裝　西方三國願與蘇恢復談判　堅持解除柏林封鎖為條件</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕法外長許曼今日在記者招待會中稱，英美法三國始終準備於柏林封鎖解除後，卽恢復四強會議與蘇會談，但渠又稱，英美法三國於去年六月在倫敦及最近在華盛頓之會議中所決定關於西德之決議，不論有無四強會議，將繼續執行。但若蘇聯準備同意堪為西方三強接受的建議，則三強所議定關於西德的措施，亦未始不可修改。許氏並保證德國決不致重披武裝，亦不致為大西洋公約之參加國，因為加入大西洋公約必須為武裝國家。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電〕法外長許曼今日於出席閣議討論國際問題後，接見記者時宣稱，德人如拒絕接受波恩憲法，則西方盟國在德有取共同行動之可能性，至於取何行動，言之尚屬過早，因社會民主黨雖予掇，大局今仍有於下週好轉希望，德人同意盟國所贊同之憲法，可使華府所議定新佔領法規得以實施，而予德國以更大之自由，與處理事務更大之責任。德人當知彼等今日仍處於由於戰敗淪陷之地位，迄未有和約與政府。彼等必須接受過渡之階段，在此階段中請求一種正常之治制，實屬錯誤。許氏繼答覆關於蘇聯試探取銷柏林封鎖與反封鎖之問話事，謂法政府仍以為門戶今仍如前之開啓，蘇聯如取銷柏林封鎖，則可使一九四七年停頓之四國會議重行開始，盟國之反封鎖與蘇聯之封鎖同時取銷，則可恢復一九四八年六月杪前之局勢。</p>

<p>自由談海南島風土  信一　　海南一地，僻處吾國邊陲，其居民多屬黎族，故其風土人情，亦與內地逈異。筆者頃聞某海南歸客語及其土民之生活善，頗多怪異之處，茲特撰其尤者如下：　　信仰：崇尚多元之拜佛教，舉凡獅虎牛羊之塑像，俱為具膜拜對象，日必對之行跪拜禮，甚為虔誠。若家中有人罹疾，則拜之更篤，唯若病人未見好轉或竟死亡者，則對該塑像施以百般侮辱，或棄之火中焚燬之。此後卽另塑新像，以為崇拜之新對象。　　家族：彼等家族觀念之深，尤其於內地同胞。輒因家族間之爭執，而發生大規模械鬥。每次械鬥後，其家門首卽懸一繩結，以資紀念，並炫其勇武。各家所懸結數不一，自然結至十餘結不等。　　婚姻：純屬原始的「掠奪婚姻」，氣力過人者，逞強肆意搶刧婦女，據為己妻。其婚禮儀式亦頗隆重，每邀所有親朋往觀，客至則贄以豬肉一塊，厚五寸，面積一尺見方，且為半生不熟者。若客不能盡，則視為莫大恥辱，將對之採取「嚴厲手段」，甚或喪命。吾友至其村落，適為其酋長結婚之日，聞外客來，特相邀請，吾友恐將有所不利，託故未去。　　喪葬：病人垂亡之際，由其族人舁之置大樹椏間，樹下生火，由一人上樹推之下，使葬身火，卽化為骨灰。　　生活：彼地以天氣火熱，令人終日昏昏欲睡，故其土民除夜間正常之睡眠外，隨時隨地皆可昏然入寐，且每睡輒數小時之久。至於沐浴，亦彼等日常生活中一要事，其浴忿皆由樹榦挖空製成者，深而且巨。彼等每日出獵，隨身攜帶黃色大布袋一，夜不及歸或疲倦之時，卽置身袋中，以繩緊扣。野獸遇之，疑為土丘，無傷焉。　　審美：除習見之「文身」外，其女子之耳，自幼卽鑒一小孔，孔中雜以細物；旣長，則實以較大之物；如此，其空漸大，及成年，其耳根已可下垂及肩矣。嘗見耳孔中實以半徑達寸餘之圓木塊，上雕花紋以為美觀者。　　疾病：其地多虐蚊，故虐疾甚流行，旅客如攜奎寗等藥品往者，必大受歡迎。　　最後，寄語讀者諸君，切勿因好奇而為彼等拍攝照片，否則性命堪虞；照相機為彼等深惡痛絕者，蓋恐攝去魂魄也。照相  屈新　　最近，我領到了一筆五萬塊錢的稿費。　　五萬塊錢在現在，雖然僅夠買五分之一個大頭，但是對於我，卻是一個很大的數目。　　我考慮着如何把它用出去，要很適當地用出去。　　起先，我想把它拿到小飯館裏去吃一碗肉麵，滋潤滋潤整天消化青菜糙米的腸胃。但是，後來我卻認為這樣做是沒有意義的，我要呌這萬塊錢留下點痕跡。　　我想到了照相。對了，相片，這是件唯一能留下生活痕跡的東西，是最有意義的。何況，假如要領什麼證件，辦什麼手續，都非需要它不可。不如早早預備，免得臨時措手不及。　　於是，我跑到一家比較蹩腳的照相館去，為了想價錢便宜一點的緣故。　　據說價錢便宜，也要七萬塊錢才拍得到。沒有辦法，旣來之，則安之，只好先把我僅有的那五萬塊錢繳去。我看出照相館老閭的臉色很不好看，為了我欠兩萬塊錢。　　拍照的時候，我想，我這張照一定不會拍得好的，因為我的臉色也一定很不好看的。　　出了照相館的門，我很懊悔，不該拿這筆錢去拍照。這個時代的人們，那副臉是不適宜於照相的啊！手的故事  手的美　　據審美專家統計研究，天下女人有最美麗的手的，首推愛爾蘭女子，次為波蘭女子。美國女人的玉手，毛病在過於修長。英國女子的，則遺憾在太肥厚多肉。德國女子的手過短，且手掌太闊。西班牙女子的手為最劣者，雖然西班牙女子曾獲得「天下第一美女」的榮譽。　　握手俗　　關於握手的習慣，有兩種傳說。　　有人說，握手的習慣發源於以色列。它像徵的是和平，安全，友誼和團結。他們說：「如果你的心和我的一樣，那麼，給我你的手吧：」　　又有人說，握手而用右手，係表示放下武器，全無惡意。　　至如吻手的來源，有人認為應推源於古代人的宗教祈禱。因為，那些神像十分高大，禱告者只能及其手部，俯身吻之。所以吻手的意義，初本表示尊敬服從　　看掌紋　　預知富貴榮辱的掌紋學，本是假的。事實上，每一個人的手掌都有一定的紋，甚至連猩猩也是有的，且並不改變。然而，看掌之風，各處皆有。除了中國之外，美國，南美洲國家，及吉卜賽人信此者甚多。但在英國卻是禁止的，看掌觸犯的刑章，不是騙財，而是「游蕩罪」。這法律是在一八二四年頒佈的。詠莎士比亞樂府  鄭曉滄　　（一）孤島奇緣TheTempeor　　姹女盈盈渾璞姿　飄零孤島長於斯　　一朝波浪驚魂際　萬斛恩仇到眼時　　非霧非煙歌斷續　乍悲乍喜意敢癡　　呼風又送歸帆穩　滄海珠還緣亦奇　　（二）天上情禽Romeo　and　Juliel　　一絲偏繋兩冤家　舞歇宵深意轉加　　蕭寺定情情似漆　長橋喋血血如花　　郎流異地魂馳鹿　鳳飲奇壓策避鴉　　雙死雙生爭片刻　鴛鴦遺恨滿天涯　　（三）寒宵述古The　Winter's　Tale　　春水一池吹縐了　杯弓底事費疑猜　　分明靈語嗔難息　宛轉蛾眉心始摧　　天惜朱襦留塊肉　帆還碧海悵餘灰　　溫溫玉琢人如活　驚見姍姍謫降來　　（四）獃男潑女Taming　of　the　Shnew　　女名悍潑誰能近　卻有奇男來好逑　　金諾未承施狡俊　雕鞍遲到試鴛鴦　　眠餐削奪佯憐惜　鹿馬隨訛敢自由　　那見河東獅子吼　脫胎換骨變羔柔　　（五）荒山遯跡Timon　of　Athens　　珠履三千笑語喧　解囊贈馬復開尊　　泥沙漉漉誰憐惜　　重空空客浪奔　　塵世炎涼已過遍　嚴冬霜雪亦成溫　　荒山遜跡埋孤憤　嗚咽寒潮到暮門　　編者按：本詩為作者紀念莎翁誕辰（四月二十三日）而作，因稿寄到較遲，故於今日補行刋出。熱大頭昏  蕭亢石　　滬諺有「熱儂大頭昏」句，考諸今日，大頭風頭之健，冠於金鈔百物之上，隨時隨地可以交易，可稱為最「熱門」的東西。而漲得「昏天黑地」，真應了「熱儂大頭昏」之諺語矣。</p>

<h3>The Capital's Evacuation Completed; Wu Yifang and Others Form a Maintenance Committee, Posting Notices on the Streets; Zhenjiang, Danyang, and Changzhou All Reported Abandoned</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd, 6:20 PM Telegraph] The Nanjing government's evacuation work has already been completed. In the airspace above the airport, planes came and went, one after another, evacuating government personnel all day long. Until dusk, the sound of engines could still be heard. Huang Shao-gu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, was one of the last to evacuate. From this morning, order within the city fell into extreme chaos due to the withdrawal of troops and police. Mobs and underground Communist Party workers were active everywhere, and looting and gunfire followed in succession. From the Presidential Palace and the residences of important officials to shops, all were subjected to their looting. Rice shops in the urban area were also targets of their looting. Most of the shops in the commercial district were closed. As of the time of this dispatch, no trace of the Communist army has been found in the city. At 11:00 AM, a notice from the Maintenance Committee was discovered on the street, bearing the names of Wu Yifang, President of Ginling Women's University, Chen Yuguang, Speaker of the Municipal Council, and Ma Qingyuan, a retired military officer. The volunteer police organized by the committee also appeared on the streets in the afternoon. When they encountered gatherings of people, they fired shots into the air to disperse them. Looting has almost not disappeared in various places, but order is slightly better than in the morning. A raging fire burned at the Xiaguan railway station; water, electricity, and telephone services were not affected. The "Yuan Datou" silver dollar reached a high of one million "gold yuan" for one silver dollar, then fell to 700,000, and in the evening fell to 500,000.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd, 10:30 PM Telegraph] The situation in the capital on the morning of the 23rd was chaotic, with many looting incidents. By noon, a Maintenance Committee had appeared, with Ma Qingyuan and Wu Yifang serving as Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively. Local defense groups emerged to maintain order. In the afternoon, except for robberies still occurring in remote streets and alleys, order had mostly been restored on the main streets. By 9:00 PM, a large fire had started in Xiaguan, and many shells were falling in the Guanghua Gate area. The airport had been automatically destroyed, and warehouses had also automatically exploded. Currently, the Communist army has not yet entered the city. Electricity, telephone, and water supplies are normal and have not been interrupted. The city is gradually returning to tranquility.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] After Acting President Li and Premier He left Nanjing, their residences were looted.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] The Nanjing Maintenance Committee held a meeting today to discuss maintaining security in the capital city. In addition, the remaining police force has also recruited volunteers to form a motorcycle patrol to patrol the entire city. Order within the city is gradually returning to normal. The American Embassy remains calm as usual. No Americans have been ordered to gather, and based on current indications, personal safety does not seem to be an issue. Street vendors have refused to accept "gold yuan" currency.</p>
<p>Another source from Xiaguan reports: Fighting ceased at 10:00 AM, with only the rearguard troops of the National Army occasionally firing shells at the Communist army in Pukou to cover the National Army's retreat, but the Communist army is not retaliating.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd, 12:30 AM Urgent Telegraph] The National Army began a full-scale withdrawal on the 23rd from the Yangtze River area, stretching approximately 450 miles from Jiujiang in the west to the mouth of the Yangtze River in the east. According to news arriving in Nanjing this afternoon, all riverside ports have been evacuated, and all National Army troops have withdrawn to Hangzhou and other South China areas. As of the time of this dispatch, Nanjing has become a military no-man's land. A portion of the 45th Army, which was covering the retreat of government agencies, has also left the city, while the Communist army has not yet crossed the river from Pukou.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] The Communist Army Headquarters telegraphed here at 12:30 PM on the 23rd, stating: The Communist Army will begin crossing the river at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 24th. Political envoys have arrived here and notified the Bank of China and various government agencies to begin taking over on the 24th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Local Dispatch, 23rd] Central Air Transport Corporation pilot Ma Jun circled Nanjing three times at an altitude of 500 feet. According to his report, Nanjing Station and the area along the river outside the city are engulfed in flames, and trains are burning. There is one government warship patrolling in the river; others have either been scuttled or are burning, but no artillery fire or sounds of artillery have been seen. Most of the damage is the work of the National Army's demolition squads. All Air Force planes have left Nanjing. About 75 miles from the capital, there are twenty government warships, three of which are on fire. According to another pilot, Sha Di, the road from Nanjing to the south for over 200 miles is filled with refugees. This morning, black smoke rose like clouds in the northern part of Nanjing. China National Aviation Corporation pilot Norman said that artillery fire in Jiangyin is fierce, and the National Army in Zhenjiang is retreating south. The bunkers along the coast between Nanjing and Zhenjiang are deserted. This morning, a car from the Central Air Transport Corporation heading to the airport was requisitioned by the National Army. Sixty military police officers stood around the passengers as they boarded the plane. At a single command, they all jumped onto the plane and flew to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 23rd] According to news from railway authorities this morning, the Communist army has occupied Zhenjiang and the two cities of Danyang and Changzhou on the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Vanguard Reaches the Outskirts of Wuxi; City Order Maintained by Industry and Commerce Self-Defense Corps</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 23rd, 11:45 PM Telegraph] The Communist army has reached the entrance to the Wuxi-Chengjiang Highway, one mile outside the North Gate. Government agencies had already withdrawn to Suzhou during the day. Order in the city is still good and is being maintained by the Industry and Commerce Self-Defense Corps.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 23rd] The city defense headquarters, county government, regimental headquarters, First Military Police Regiment, security forces, railway police, and a portion of regular troops all completed their withdrawal by 6:00 PM on the 23rd. The police have also left, so Wuxi is now a vacuum. It is reported that the vanguard of the Communist army has reached the outskirts.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 23rd] This morning, business here was as usual. At noon, rumors spread that the city would be under martial law, so people were uneasy and shops closed, creating a wartime scene.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd] Order in Wuxi is still stable, and newspapers are still being published as usual. The troops have withdrawn, and the Industry and Commerce Self-Defense Corps is maintaining security. Machine gun and artillery fire can be heard in Wuxi.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 23rd] The war situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse. The vanguard of the Communist army reached the Wuxi-Chengjiang border on the 23rd. Military authorities confirmed that Chengjiang County was abandoned at 11:00 PM on the 22nd. At 8:00 AM on the 23rd, fierce fighting broke out between the two sides at Qingyang Town, the center of the Wuxi-Chengjiang Road. Most of the towns in Chengjiang have now fallen into the hands of the Communist army. According to 21st Army Commander Wang speaking to reporters on the morning of the 23rd, the Communist army that crossed the river the night before was Chen Yi's 23rd, 28th, and 29th Divisions.</p>
<h3>Special Plane to Pick Up Peace Envoys Returns; Flies to Qingdao and Then to Beiping This Morning</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] The Central Air Transport Corporation will dispatch special plane No. 533 from Shanghai to Qingdao and then to Beiping at 6:00 AM on the 24th to pick up Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, and other members of the government peace delegation currently remaining in Beiping to return south. The special plane plans to fly back to Shanghai on the same day.</p>
<h3>Premier He Orders Localities to Strictly Guard Against Petty Criminals Causing Trouble</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd] Premier He Yingqin telegraphed all local governments and security agencies on the 21st to intensify the maintenance of social order and security, and strictly guard against petty criminals causing trouble. The provincial government received the telegram yesterday. The original text stated: "In order to eliminate the scourge of war and realize peace, all measures taken since the beginning of this year have been in accordance with the national people's desire for peace, taking the highest interests of the country and people as the premise, seeking compromise and diligently striving for peace. However, the Communist Party has continued to attack even during the peace talks, and the proposed peace agreement is similar to an instrument of surrender and is subject to a deadline for reply, which is even more like an ultimatum. The original document was disclosed in the newspapers, and the military and civilians are deeply indignant. The government telegraphed the delegation to inform the Communist Party, hoping that it would confirm the principle that the people's interests are higher than everything else, reconsider the basic spirit and content of the agreement, and hope to establish a temporary truce agreement as soon as possible to show the sincerity of both parties in seeking true peace. However, Mao Zedong and Zhu De, because the government refused to accept humiliating conditions, have issued an order to the Communist army to launch a full-scale offensive against the government area. The Communist Party is exhausting its military might and is hostile to the nation and the people, which is deeply hateful. At this time, all local security and social order must be intensified and strictly guarded against petty criminals taking the opportunity to cause trouble. In areas where martial law has already been implemented, the martial law should be re-announced and strictly enforced."</p>

<h3>Communist Army Plans to Isolate Shanghai; Intends to Take a Route Through Southern Anhui, Invade Western Zhejiang, and Eye Hangzhou; Communist Army in Anhui Continues to Cross the River and Capture Wuhu</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] Following the lightning collapse of Nanjing and the entire Yangtze River defense line, the Communist army vanguard is accelerating its advance south and east in an attempt to isolate Shanghai. After capturing several cities, their vanguard is now only fifty miles from Suzhou. If they continue to advance southeast, they can reach Jiaxing in just two hundred miles, cutting off Shanghai's land connection to the outside world. The Communist army that landed near Wuhu has advanced to the vicinity of Xuancheng. Wuhu was lost this morning. Another Communist army force, after crossing the river near Anqing, is also advancing southeast, seemingly intending to take a route through southern Anhui, invade western Zhejiang, and capture Hangzhou. The Communist army participating in the river-crossing campaign, Chen Yi's Second Field Army, is advancing east. In addition, there are 200,000 to 300,000 National Army troops of Liu Bocheng's Third Field Army, who crossed the river south of Wuhu. If they can quickly escape the Communist army's encirclement, it is expected that they will retreat to a line of defense at Ningbo, Hangzhou, and Nanchang. The overall retreat of the National Army along the Yangtze River is likely the result of yesterday's meeting in Hangzhou. Military observers predict that the Communist army may temporarily refrain from taking Shanghai and instead directly attack the line of Nanchang, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. The attack on Shanghai may not occur until the Communist army is able to establish a supply line downstream of the Yangtze River. The ability to establish this supply line depends on the extent of the advance of Lin Biao's large army.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanchang, 23rd] The 360-mile river defense line between Jiujiang and Anqing was breached by the Communist army near Wangjiang Yangwan the night before. The first batch of Communist troops to cross the river numbered about 4,000, followed by a second batch of 8,000. Currently, the river defense troops between Hukou and Dongliu have withdrawn, and their whereabouts are unknown. The Pengze County government is also moving with the garrison. There are no National Army troops in Pengze and the areas to the east. The river defense between Hukou and Jiujiang is now being defended by troops dispatched by the Eighth Pacification District. The Hukou County government is still working in the city. The administrative meeting convened by the provincial government ended early last night. The county magistrates along the river left the province by car this morning. Telephones in Nanchang and Pengze are normal, but communications between Xunyang and Nanjing were once interrupted.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] According to reliable sources, the first batch of Communist troops to cross the river was 6,000 men from Liu Bocheng's command, who crossed the river south of Guanzhou, 15 kilometers southwest of Anqing, before dawn on the 19th. Chen Yi's command followed closely behind, landing at Digang with 30,000 men at 3:00 AM on the 20th. At 6:00 AM on the 20th, Air Force planes arrived over the Digang River and discovered about 3,000 large and small ships crossing the river, densely packed and stretching across the river. Subsequently, the Communist army that landed at Jiangyin approached the Jiangyin Fortress on the morning of the 21st, and the fortress commander, Dai Rongguang, immediately led his troops to welcome them with white flags. On the night of the 21st, the Communist army landed near Zhenjiang. On the 22nd, the Communist army landed at Caishiji. On the morning of the 23rd, a small force of Communist troops landed at Yanziyi, 15 miles east of Xiaguan in Nanjing. By this point, Chen Yi's command controlled the bridgehead positions on the south bank in five sections from Digang to Jiangyin. The Communist troops invading in the Digang and Jiangyin sections penetrated deep into Fanchang and approached Wuxi, respectively. On the north bank of the Yangtze River above Anqing, it is reported that Liu Bocheng's command of the Communist army also has 10,000 ships, which have crossed the river in sections with tens of thousands of Communist troops. This batch of Communist troops is using Zhide as a starting point to penetrate deep into the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line in Jiangxi province. Their intention is clearly to cut off the main forces of the National Army in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou from the passages to Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, and other provinces, in order to engage in a decisive battle with the main forces of the National Army in the Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas.</p>

<h3>East Side of the Beijing-Hankou Railway; Majority of Communist Army Moves East; Situation in Xiaogan Temporarily Stabilizes</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Huangpi, 23rd] Military News: Most of Lin Biao's troops east of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, south of Changxuanling, have moved east. There is only one regiment of the Communist army in that area. Currently, there are no large groups of the Communist army within forty miles north of Huangpi. In addition, the main force of the 43rd Army of Lin Biao's command, numbering over 15,000 men, which is gathered in Macheng, Songbu, and Huang'an in eastern Hubei, remains in its original position.

<h3>Capital Strategically Evacuated; National Army Resolves to Continue the Struggle; Government Spokesman Issues Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The government spokesman issued a statement on the National Army's withdrawal from the capital, stating: "The Communist Party took advantage of the government's final appeal for peace and a truce to launch a general offensive and cross the Yangtze River south on a large scale, causing Digang, Jiangyin, Yangzhong, and other places to be abandoned one after another, and the capital fell into a pincer-shaped offensive. Our troops stationed in the capital were in a passive position for a time and unable to exert their full combat power. Our commander-in-chief, assessing the situation, believes that the current stage is not suitable for a decisive resolution. We had no choice but to automatically carry out a strategic withdrawal from the capital. Moreover, the government had already moved to Guangzhou earlier, and the headquarters is properly settled. All offices left by government agencies in Nanjing will be closed and return to the birthplace of our revolution to continue the struggle for the independence of the country and the freedom of the people. The reason why the Communist Party used violence to end the peace talks and expand the war is due to its consistent international conspiracy to sell out the country and the nation and enslave the people of the whole country. Observing the direction of people's hearts around the world, the great struggle for democracy and freedom will eventually be victorious. It is by no means possible for the Communist Party's temporary and local military adventures to reverse its final fate. The government is convinced that all compatriots and all officers and soldiers, recalling the difficulties in building the Republic of China and grieving over the fact that the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum has suffered another catastrophe, will act with a heavy heart, a spirit of great fearlessness, loyalty, courage, and dedication to make the most arduous struggle for the country and the people, and strive for the personality and final victory of our revolutionary people and revolutionary soldiers. The final victory will belong to patriots and not to traitors, and it will belong to proponents of democracy and freedom, not to proponents of dictatorship and violence. This can be asserted."</p>

He watched the situation along the Yangtze River and the Beijing-Shanghai highway and railway lines but did not find any signs of large groups of the Communist army marching.</p>

<h3>Seeking a Thorough Resolution to the Land Problem</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zheng</p>
<p>In our founding declaration, we loudly proclaimed: "We clearly see that tomorrow's China will be a unified, democratic, and progressive nation on its own territory; and in the world, it will be an advancing, constructive, and glorious nation." We also appealed: "Compatriots across the country, regardless of profession, class, party, or gender, must awaken and organize together to seek a thorough resolution to the land problem and realize the new China we wish to see."</p>
<p>We land reformers have always firmly believed that the cruel wars of mankind are due to the lack of a perfect land system, sufficient to allow mankind to live peacefully and work together to overcome nature and create civilization. Mankind has gone astray, believing that war can solve survival problems, hence the tragic history of mankind's mutual slaughter for thousands of years. The highest belief of us land reformers is to reform the land system by peaceful means, create an environment suitable for survival, and fundamentally eliminate the concept of human mutual struggle. Therefore, we firmly believe that the solution to all social problems must be based on "social justice" and "personal freedom." Only reforms based on "social justice" and "personal freedom" are truly genuine and reasonable reforms that can lead to kind human cooperation and create a brand new history for mankind.</p>
<p>Based on this basic belief, we have been calling for the reform of China's land system for eighteen years—from the China Land Problem Research Association and the Land Administration Society in 1932 to today's China Land Reform Association. We deeply understand that China's land problem is the main cause of the problem of governance and chaos in Chinese dynasties. We have painstakingly advised the government to show sincerity and courage to solve the land issue. However, the speaker speaks earnestly, but the listener scorns. Until last autumn, our last and low-demand farmland reform bill was still discriminated against and shelved by the government and the Legislative Yuan. The ruling party lacked the determination and courage to solve the people's most pressing survival problem—the land problem. Its failure today is inevitable and not accidental. Today, the central and some provincial and municipal government authorities also know that they should take land reform as a mere slogan, but they still lack the sincerity to take action. Their failure will obviously continue or become more thorough. On the other hand, our call for land reform has not been truly accepted by the general intellectuals and opposition parties in society. Sometimes, although land reform is listed as a political program, they emphasize using it as a tool for political struggle rather than as a real policy for solving people's problems.</p>
<p>We believe that China's economic foundation today is still within the scope of the agricultural economy. Land is the foundation of survival for the majority of people. If the land exploitation system—the landlord system—is still allowed to exist, then only a small number of people—the landlord class—will have enough food and clothing, and the majority will only live on the starvation line. This is a great violation of "social justice." At the same time, in a society based on an agricultural economy, land is still a tool to guarantee the freedom of life for the majority of farmers. If farmers are deprived of their land, they will lose the guarantee of "personal freedom." Therefore, we believe that the "farmland to the tiller" policy is indeed an excellent policy established on the dual foundations of "social justice" and "personal freedom," and all parties must deeply understand it, list it as a common political program, and implement it effectively.</p>
<p>At the same time, natural resources are a treasure house given to all mankind by nature and should not be occupied and plundered by a small number of people under any name. The value of urban land is the result of the common civilization of human society and should not be cleverly seized by urban parasites—urban real estate operators. We believe that everyone should have an appropriate place to live. Therefore, we also advocate that every family should have a suitable unit of housing and land. These should be common proposals for solving the people's survival problem. We hope that those who seek the country's welfare will no longer be biased by standing on a certain class.</p>
<p>China's suffering is enough. Now, powerful parties and prestigious social leaders should all show sincerity and consider the country and the people. They must eliminate all private opinions and completely seek national affairs based on the two major foundations of "social justice" and "personal freedom." All political, economic, and social problems must be used as a yardstick to measure whether various reforms meet these two major requirements. If only "social justice" is taken into account without considering "personal freedom," this will stifle social civilization and hinder human evolution; this is "false equality." If only "personal freedom" is taken into account without considering "social justice," this will promote social unrest and hinder the welfare of the masses; this is "false freedom." If these two foundations cannot be considered simultaneously, they are not true reforms or permanent welfare. If peace is accidentally obtained in this way, it is also "false peace." Social evolution and turmoil will still follow. We hope that those who seek the country's welfare will not make mistakes again in the future.</p>
<p>If they can discuss all practical problems based on these two major foundations, they can be solved easily. All the problems in the world, if we can jointly respect "justice" and mutually respect "freedom," we can achieve a consistent and permanent truth. We need a political system, an economic system, and a social system that conforms to "social justice" and "personal freedom." We hope that the authorities responsible for solving national problems will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>At the same time, we ask all members of society to make this appeal together and to jointly supervise the progress in the future. Whoever violates this principle is not truly seeking permanent welfare and peace for the country and the people.</p>
<p>The eyes of the people are discerning. We are waiting to see!</p>

<h3>Hu Shih Tells Reporters in the United States: I Can Eventually Obtain U.S. Aid - Government Decides to Maintain Free China and Recover Lost Territory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency San Francisco, 22nd Dispatch] Hu Shih stated at a reception for Chinese and American reporters on the morning of the 22nd: He firmly believes that Acheson's recent letter on the China policy issue does not fundamentally close the door to future aid to the Chinese government in spirit. Hu Shih made this statement in response to a reporter's question. He said: After studying the full text of Acheson's letter on the President Cleveland ship, I believe that two points are inevitable: (1) The U.S. government and people are both anti-communist and determined to oppose the expansion of communist totalitarianism everywhere; (2) Countries that can resist the expansion and tyranny of communist totalitarianism will be able to obtain U.S. aid. I believe that if the Chinese government proves its ability to resist communism, then U.S. aid will come without being requested. In other words, China will be able to obtain this aid. I know Acheson as a person and know that he really sympathizes with China. As for the general situation in China, Hu Shih said: The Chinese government's rejection of the communist conditions is very important to the world, because accepting the conditions is equivalent to 400 million Chinese people surrendering to communism. The lessons of Eastern European countries have made the Chinese government understand that a coalition government completely controlled by the communists is equivalent to complete surrender. He believes that the government will try its best to maintain a free China in the largest possible area and recover as much lost territory as possible. The government under the leadership of Acting President Li will continue to receive the support of President Chiang and the people. A reporter asked whether the Chinese government can mobilize the people of free China to continue to resist. Hu Shih said: The government has several advantages. The communists have shown the people of free China that life under communist rule is unbearable for ordinary people. The current life in North China is clear proof of this. The government still has a good navy and a strong air force, which, if used properly, will be a powerful reliance to prevent the communists from entering southern China. After arriving here yesterday morning, Mr. Hu was very hospitable. University of California President Sproul held an afternoon tea party. The university faculty association will host a banquet for Mr. Hu this noon. San Francisco Chronicle editor Smith will host a dinner tomorrow night. On the 25th, Stanford University President Sterling will host a reception.</p>

<p>[United Press United Kingdom Dartmouth, 22nd Dispatch] The number one leader of the British Communist Party, Pollitt, gave a speech here at night, involving the incident of the CCP army shelling the British warship in the Yangtze River, which aroused public outrage. He was surrounded by the crowd and finally rescued by the police and hid in a house. The naval city of Dartmouth is the location of the British Naval University and is in a state of emotional turmoil due to the British warship being shelled. When Pollitt asked why the "Amethyst" warship was sailing upstream on the Yangtze River, one person rushed forward and threw a rope and a note to Pollitt, forcing him to commit suicide. The note read: "Judas (the traitor who betrayed Christ) received this kind of rope in the beginning. I ask you to do the same. Ankhorst White, the father of a sailor killed in the Yangtze River." Other members of the crowd went forward and burned the red flag covering the speaker's platform. Seeing that the situation was not right, the police immediately escorted Pollitt to a nearby house to hide. About 1,000 people followed and surrounded the house, and fought with Pollitt's believers. The crowd shouted, "You should take the Russian name Pollitski," "We must fight the Russians to the end."</p>

It was not until the 22nd that it was learned that a total of four of the above ships were British warships. In the course of fighting with the above warships, the People's Liberation Army suffered 252 casualties, and part of the positions and weapons were destroyed.

<p>Police and city officials invited representatives from all sectors yesterday to discuss the implementation of the Shanghai Defense War, hoping to gain understanding of the authorities' difficulties and seeking suggestions. Gu Zhenggang, Yan Huiqing, and others attended and delivered speeches. [Report from this newspaper] Commander of the Songhu Garrison Chen Daqing and Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Chen Liang, in light of the Communist army's brazen attack and the entry of Nanjing and Shanghai into a state of war, announced important wartime regulations and discussed various wartime measures to maintain public order. They specially invited leaders from the city's party, government, and military, legal entities, schools, business and industry, and the press to a discussion meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 9:00 AM yesterday. Attendees included: Yan Huiqing, Gu Zhenggang, Liu Hongsheng, Song Hanzhang, Pan Gongzhan, Gu Yuquan, Qin Runqing, Xu Xiaoyan, Li Zhaobao, Yu Bingjian, Cheng Cangbo, Guo Yunguan, Zha Liangjian, Hu Jianzhong, Wang Zhizhuo, Li Shouyong, Diao Peiran, Huang Zhuoqiu, Fan Zhengbo, Cao Gubing, Pan Shihao, Zhang Zige, Wang Zhuyi, Zheng Lianqi, Gao Fang, Cao Yinzhi, Tao Yishan, Zhang Yongnian, Liu Jingyi, Wang Zhaohuai, Wang Xianqing, and Li Tanliang, among over a hundred others. Commander Chen presided over the meeting. Chen, with a heavy and indignant heart, reported on the current military situation from the perspective of a military leader, stating that the Communist Party deliberately sabotaged peace talks by presenting eight demands in twenty-four harsh conditions. Zhu De and Mao Zedong have ordered a general offensive, and the military situation on the front lines is urgent, with full-scale operations resuming. There is no doubt that Shanghai is an important base from military, economic, and cultural perspectives. Following government instructions and central decisions, Shanghai must be defended to fight for the people's freedom and national independence. He solemnly announced that Shanghai has fully entered a state of war. The Communist Party's so-called eight demands in twenty-four conditions are even more cruel than the actions of the Japanese, with a tyranny and terror that makes it impossible to be a good citizen. The question of whether the people's freedom will be guaranteed in the future is becoming a serious issue. Our defense war is a forced one. Chen reported on the situation along the Yangtze River defense line, stating that some Communist troops have already crossed the river, and the military authorities are mobilizing troops to suppress them. To successfully complete the Shanghai Defense War, ensure social security, strengthen public order, stabilize finance, and maintain transportation, it is necessary to implement military control, which is a common need. During this period of military operations, to ensure local security in Shanghai, any illegal activities such as sabotage and spreading rumors will be punished with the most severe military law. He hopes that all sectors understand the authorities' difficult position and that local authorities will provide valuable suggestions as much as possible, and that the military and civilians will unite to implement the Shanghai Defense War and fulfill our mission. Raise the awareness of all sectors and hope for three efforts Subsequently, Gu Zhenggang delivered a speech, stating that Commander Chen's report on the defense of Shanghai and the situation of the Communist Party's talks was very thorough. At this time of great change, he is very willing to meet with everyone to seek advice and, as a member of the nation, with twelve thousand points of enthusiasm, is determined to follow Commander Chen and the leaders of this city to fight together. Fighting requires determination, and with determination, there is strength, and first, there must be a basic understanding and concept, and then final victory will be assured. His basic understanding of the war is: (1) an anti-aggression war, (2) an anti-totalitarian war, and (3) an anti-surrender war. To protect the original social and family system traditions, to stop the violent aggression of the Communist International, to fight for the people's survival and freedom, and to maintain thousands of years of inherent culture, we have no choice but to fight for self-defense and for national independence. Gu acknowledged the various factors of the Kuomintang's past failures but denied that it was the Communist Party's success. The Kuomintang has since deeply regretted its past mistakes and decided on three major policies: (1) unite patriotic people within the country, (2) unite leaders of democratic and free parties within the country, and (3) unite anti-aggression countries and nations in the world to fight together. Final victory will surely belong to us. Gu also, with an extremely firm and sincere attitude, raised the awareness of all sectors in the city, hoping that: (1) we will strive to win the survival of the nation, (2) we can protect property only by going bankrupt, and (3) we can protect life only by risking it. We will support this anti-aggression war with all human, material, and financial resources. Believe that in the shortest time there is still a mediation method Yan Huiqing said in his speech: I feel ashamed that I have not been able to make a great contribution to this KMT-CPC peace negotiation. The peace talks officially started on April 1, and I finally hoped to achieve a peaceful solution. It is a pity that they are on the verge of breaking down within three weeks. Now that the Communist army has crossed the Yangtze River, the national army has to deal with it, and all Chinese people should obey the measures of the military authorities. However, I still hope that in the short term, or after a month, there will be another opportunity to reopen peace talks. We must know that we cannot overcome everything by force alone. I believe that the Communist Party will not ignore the people's desire for peace and ignore China's inherent culture and morality, and there will still be mediation methods in the end. Firmly believe that the government's decision will be fully supported by the people Pan Gongzhan said in his speech: After the Communist Party proposed eight items and twenty-four clauses to the government, the Communist Party's face has been completely revealed. In the so-called people's coalition government, in addition to the Communist Party occupying the majority of seats, other parties must be appointed by the Communist Party, which is known to be manipulated. Mao Zedong's statement on the Atlantic Charter that in the event of a third world war, he would fight together with the Soviet Union is intended to throw the entire Chinese people into the arms of the Soviet Union and sacrifice and fight for Soviet communism. It is found that the harsh conditions proposed by the Communist Party should not only be resolutely rejected by the government, but also unanimously demanded by the people. At present, the opinions of all parties in Nanjing and Guangzhou are that the Communist Party's advance and the destruction of the peace talks have made the internal unity completely strong in the face of a major enemy. It is firmly believed that the government's decision will be fully supported by the people. It is also firmly believed that Shanghai will become a strong fortress and a beacon of freedom in the Far East. If Shanghai can stand firm, the world situation will be changed. We should use the spirit of the people of Shanghai to inspire the morale of the soldiers on the front lines. Pan believes that since Shanghai has been declared in a state of war, it is urgent to eliminate spies, and he asks the military authorities to strengthen vigilance and attention. Maintain order in the rear and pay attention to finance and economy Xu Jiyi said in his speech: Since the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, Shanghai has been in constant turmoil, but none is as serious as the current situation. This era is by no means comparable to the situation thirty-eight years ago. Our minimum requirement is security, and we hope that business and industry will contribute money and effort to fully support the military and political authorities' emergency measures. Secondly, Cheng Cangbo, representing the press, said that in order to defend freedom and for the safety of life, the attitude of the press is very firm, and the Communist Party cannot coexist. Cheng also suggested that the military authorities appoint a person in charge to regularly release correct military news, maintain order in the rear, and pay more attention to finance and economy. The central government should quickly set up a method to cooperate with the military operations. Subsequently, Zhang Yi, President of Fudan University, and Yi Min of the Literary and Cultural Association spoke one after another. Commander Chen briefly answered various active suggestions, and the meeting adjourned at about 11:00 AM. Finance Minister Liu arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and had frequent contact with various sectors. Finance Minister and Governor of the National Bank Liu Gongyun arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. At 8:30 AM, he went to the National Bank to handle official business, and then went to the Bank of China Building to attend the routine meeting of the Exchange Equalization Fund. After the meeting, Liu met with Minister of Transportation Duanmu Jie at the National Bank to discuss the Ministry of Transportation's funding issues. In the afternoon, Liu had frequent contact with financial leaders in Shanghai. After 5:00 PM, he convened a meeting of the heads of various bureaus and departments of the bank at the National Bank. It is reported that the discussion focused on how to cooperate with the current business as various institutions in Nanjing withdraw to Shanghai. In addition, in order to adapt to the current situation, the National Bank will work as usual on its regular weekly holiday today, but will not conduct business externally. The general situation is tense, and the number of passengers on the South China airlines has quadrupled. China Airlines has now stopped accepting reservations. [Report from this newspaper] The general situation is tense, and the number of people ordering airline tickets to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Taiwan, Fuzhou, and other places has soared in recent days. In the past two days, it is estimated that more than 3,000 people have quadrupled compared to usual. China Airlines has now stopped accepting reservations for its South China routes. Although China Airlines still accepts reservations, tickets for routes to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Taiwan have been registered until the middle of next month. The Bureau of Public Works is re-demarcating factory, warehouse, and residential areas. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in view of the fact that the Yangshupu District of this city is an important industrial area, originally formulated construction area planning rules to implement, but currently, it is difficult to implement due to the economic environment. It has now decided to study in detail with reference to the opinions of all parties and re-demarcate the original regulations for factory areas, warehouse areas, and the second and third residential areas. In addition, the boundary lines of the South Shanghai District construction area have also been revised to add the third residential area and the factory area according to the factory situation. It is heard that the above plan has been approved by the Municipal Government Conference and will be submitted to the Ninth Municipal Council for deliberation. After its passage, it will be announced and implemented and submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. The municipal government will issue salaries tomorrow, and all 40 billion yuan will be in cash. [Report from this newspaper] The municipal government, in view of the increasingly tense situation, decided to issue this month's salaries in advance tomorrow (the 25th) in accordance with 162 billion yuan in order to stabilize the lives of its employees and improve work efficiency. The remainder will be reissued after the publication of the cost of living index for public and private school teachers at the end of the month. According to the person in charge of the Finance Bureau, the total amount of the above salaries requires approximately 40 billion yuan, which was obtained from loans from the Central Bank. After days of hard work by the Finance Bureau, the funds have been fully raised and are all in cash. All of them can be issued tomorrow. In order to rush the loan procedures, the Finance Bureau will still work as usual on Sunday today. Housing donation and municipal construction donation are calculated according to the cost of living index. The Finance and Land Administration Group of the Council held a joint meeting yesterday. [Report from this newspaper] The Finance and Land Administration Subcommittee of the Council held a joint meeting at the Council at 4:00 PM yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Councilor He Yuanming, and Councilors Jiang Hao, Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhu Fuju, Li Wenjie, Qu Yue, and others attended, totaling more than 30 people. The resolutions discussed are as follows: (1) Method for calculating housing donation and municipal construction donation: After review, it was approved that 1 the total value of the houses and their donation rates (ie, 14 per mille for commercial use and 8 per mille for residential use) originally approved by the Municipal Council for housing construction donation remain unchanged. However, each Li (month) and the donation amount payable by each household have been fixed. Therefore, in the future, the two donations for housing construction will use the original donation amount as the base for donation collection, and then adjust it according to the cost of living index for the lower period of the month before each quarter (month) to obtain the housing donation and municipal construction donation payable for each quarter (month) in the future. 2 Although the housing donation and municipal construction donation are adjusted according to the index, if they are still collected quarterly, it will be very difficult to use one-time income for three months' dispatching due to the rapid devaluation of currency. Then the so-called adjustment is still nominal. Therefore, in the future, the collection of housing construction donations will be handled on a monthly basis. If it is too late to handle it this quarter, it can be combined for two months to be able to respond on a monthly basis. 3 The spring housing construction donation for this year has not yet been collected. Now, in accordance with the foregoing adjustment method, the entire quarter will be supplemented according to the cost of living index for the lower period of April, and will be handled at the same time as April or April and May to save procedures and benefit library revenue. (2) Review opinion on the method for collecting gasoline sales donations in this city: Reserved. The next period of land price tax will also be adjusted according to the index (3) Regarding the adjustment of the tax amount according to the price index for the next period of land price tax in this year, the method is: (1) Tax amount: It is proposed to multiply the tax amount for the first period of this year by the ratio difference between December 15, 1937 (ie, the date of announcement of the standard land price in 1938) and the price index 15 days before the collection (using the price total index compiled by the Central Bank) as the tax amount for the next period. (2) Time limit: The payment must be completed within 15 days after the notice is given, and a surcharge will be imposed according to regulations for exceeding the time limit (the date of collection will be determined separately). (3) Penalties: Those who pay taxes after the deadline will be fined (at a rate of 2% per month, and less than one month will be counted as one month) based on the original tax amount. From the date of exceeding the deadline, the adjustment will be made according to the price index. Those who pay taxes in the first ten days of the month will be adjusted according to the index on the 25th of the previous month, those who pay taxes in the middle ten days of the month will be adjusted according to the index on the 5th of this month, and those who pay taxes in the last ten days of the month will be adjusted according to the index on the 15th of this month. (4) In order to avoid repeated penalties, the method of adding a collection fee that was originally implemented in this city will be abolished. Review opinion: Pass. The price index will be changed to the cost of living index. (4) Proposal submitted by the mayor: Those who are slow in paying taxes shall be levied according to the price index on the day multiplied by the original tax amount, in addition to the penalties imposed according to other penalty rules. Review result: The price index in the original case was changed to the cost of living index, and it was stipulated that those who exceed the time limit by one day will increase by 5%, and those who exceed the time limit more will adopt a progressive system, increasing the proportion. The ninth general assembly of the council will be postponed. [Report from this newspaper] The ninth general assembly of the Municipal Council, which was originally scheduled to be held from the 25th of this month, has been postponed according to the opinions of the majority of councilors. The committees on public works, health, social affairs, education, police administration, and autonomy, which were originally scheduled to be convened on the 24th, have also been rescheduled. The Public Utilities Pricing Subcommittee decides that the city government should try it out for one month at its discretion, taking into account the affordability of the citizens. [Report from this newspaper] The Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Council held a meeting yesterday to discuss the pricing methods for various public utilities in this city. It was resolved that: (1) The city government should maintain public utilities, not provide them, and handle them at its discretion within the principles of taking into account the affordability of citizens, especially regarding the base number, it should be carefully reviewed and tried out for one month during the extended meeting of the ninth general assembly of the council. (2) Regarding emergency matters, the city government should negotiate with the Central Bank to assist as much as possible so that public utilities are not forced to interrupt due to lack of fuel, equipment, and funds during this extraordinary period. Passenger and freight transport on all shipping lines will be adjusted from the 25th. All will increase by 220%. The Shipping Association and the Shanghai Shipping Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday and resolved the following major issues: (1) It was decided that from the 25th, the freight rates for passengers and freight on all lines will be increased by 220% based on the original price, and the export freight from Taiwan Province will be increased by 10% based on the original price.

The practice competition was a prelude to the six-group sports meeting to be held on May 14. The Nine-Nine Athletics Team was absent yesterday due to some reason, so only five units participated in the competition temporarily. The results of the eleven athletics events were not outstanding, which shows that they have been neglecting practice at the beginning of the season. Among the field events, the competition was more intense. In the long jump, John Jiang Weiliang lost to Heath of Xiqing by less than half an inch (the result was 19 feet and 8 inches) and ranked second.

<h3>Strengthening Defenses, Preparing for War, and Enhancing Security: Sichuan Province Adopts Emergency Measures to Ban Strikes and Complete the Overall Suppression</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 23rd] To strengthen defenses and prepare for war, the Sichuan Provincial Government has adopted emergency measures to ban strikes by workers, teachers, and students, thoroughly eliminate espionage elements, complete the overall suppression of remaining bandits throughout Sichuan, comprehensively control commodity prices, and implement special inspections. Furthermore, to strengthen security in Chengdu, the 4th, 5th, and 9th Security Regiments, along with the 95th Army, have been deployed to garrison the city.</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 23rd] The Sichuan Provincial Government, acting on orders to prepare for war, is urgently rushing to repair the Diguang, Wankai, and Liangxuan three highways of the Daba Mountain national defense line. On the 23rd, an urgent order was issued to conscript one million laborers from the counties along the route to work day and night, aiming to complete the repairs before the rainy season.</p>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 23rd] The Northeast Sichuan Defense Conference, presided over by Sun Zhen, has decided to convene on May 1st in Wanxian, with the participation of Luo Guangwen, Sun Yuanliang, and the commissioners of the 9th, 10th, and 15th Administrative Districts of Sichuan.</p>
<h3>A Military Officer from Hunan, Having Just Returned from Beiping, Discusses the Situation There: Many Students Conscripted into Military Service</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 23rd] A Major military officer from Hunan, recently returned from Beiping, stated that he remained in Beiping for four months after the partial peace agreement. According to him, the situation in Beiping has completely changed since the Communists entered the city. High-ranking Communist officials dress in old and tattered clothes, resembling cooks, but each is accompanied by numerous guards. The clothing of ordinary citizens is also extremely simple, with young men and women wearing homespun and old clothes. Wealthier individuals, to avoid revealing their identities, are going to great lengths to appear impoverished. All universities have admitted young soldiers from the Communist army, while the original students have been conscripted into military service, following the army southward, purportedly to govern after the liberation of Jiangnan. Moreover, as most of the farmland in the countryside is barren, a system of rationing grain based on population has been implemented, with each person receiving only a meager allocation of sorghum that is not enough to satisfy hunger. Even vegetables are subject to control, making life unimaginably difficult. Shops remain open as usual, but business is slow, with no one interested in luxury goods. There is absolutely no freedom of speech, and newspapers only publish official reports. Since the Communists entered Beiping, they have never publicly executed anyone, but there have been numerous disappearances. In the concentration camp where he resided, there were 10,000 Nationalist soldiers and officers. Due to insufficient sorghum rations, they collectively protested, demanding improvements. Management personnel informed them that they could elect representatives to present their demands. Representatives were immediately chosen, but after they left, they never returned to the camp. Rumors of the Communists providing wives are untrue. While no public trials or struggles have been observed, the Communist policy of gender equality requires everyone to work. It is common for wives to be assigned to work in factories in one location, while husbands are transferred to another, effectively separating couples. City houses, although dilapidated, are no longer being repaired, and no citizens are building new homes. Many professors in Beiping's universities, who were once considered "democratic figures," are now silent. He had not had a haircut during his four months in Beiping, and his face was covered in beard. He shook his head and sighed repeatedly at the slogans plastered all over Changsha, suggesting that those who put up the slogans should first go and see Beiping. He repeatedly stated and swore that he had no political stance and that his words were not intended as propaganda. If he fabricated even half a sentence, he would be struck by lightning. He has decided never to travel abroad again, and will retire to his hometown and be a farmer for the rest of his life. Finally, he stated that the Communist resources are dwindling, and a quick resolution is advisable. If the Nationalist Party could thoroughly correct its past mistakes, genuinely implement the Three Principles of the People, and unite in purpose to win back the hearts of the people, it might not be too late to salvage the situation.</p>

<h3>French Foreign Minister Schuman Firmly States: Germany Will Not Be Allowed to Re-arm; The Three Western Powers Are Willing to Resume Negotiations with the Soviets, Insisting on the Lifting of the Berlin Blockade as a Condition</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] French Foreign Minister Schuman stated at a press conference today that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are consistently prepared to resume Four Power meetings and talks with the Soviets immediately after the lifting of the Berlin Blockade. However, he also stated that the resolutions regarding West Germany decided by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France at the London Conference in June last year and recently in Washington will continue to be implemented, regardless of whether or not there are Four Power meetings. However, if the Soviet Union is prepared to agree to proposals acceptable to the three Western powers, the measures regarding West Germany agreed upon by the three powers may also be modified. Schuman also assured that Germany will never be re-armed, nor will it be a member of the Atlantic Pact, because joining the Atlantic Pact requires being an armed nation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] After attending a cabinet meeting to discuss international issues today, French Foreign Minister Schuman announced to reporters that if the Germans refuse to accept the Bonn Constitution, the Western Allies may take joint action in Germany. As for what action to take, it is too early to say, because although the Social Democrats have been defeated, there is still hope for improvement in the overall situation next week. German agreement to the constitution endorsed by the Allies would allow the new occupation regulations agreed upon in Washington to be implemented, granting Germany greater freedom and greater responsibility in handling affairs. The Germans should know that they are still in a state of defeat and occupation, without a peace treaty or a government. They must accept the transitional stage, and it is a mistake to demand a normal system of governance during this stage. Schuman then answered questions regarding the Soviet Union's probes into lifting the Berlin Blockade and counter-blockade, stating that the French government still believes that the door remains open as before. If the Soviet Union lifts the Berlin Blockade, the Four Power Conference, which stalled in 1947, can be restarted. If the Allied counter-blockade and the Soviet blockade are lifted simultaneously, the situation prior to the end of June 1948 can be restored.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bonn, 22nd] The foreign ministers of the three occupying powers of West Germany have notified the Bonn German Parliamentary Council that the three countries cannot agree to the current incorporation of Berlin into the German Federal Republic. The three foreign ministers conveyed this in an informal letter, delivered by the Bonn Allied Liaison Officer to the Chairman of the Council. The letter also stated that all plans proposed by the Council to guarantee the independence of the state governments and the federal government would be considered by the three countries in turn. Any suggestions that guarantee the full rights of the states, making them independent entities within the federation, will also be given appropriate consideration.</p>
<h3>Federal Council Reaches No Agreement on Future Relationship Between Britain and India; Plenary Session to Continue Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference opened here today in a good atmosphere, initially seeking a compromise solution to keep India within the Commonwealth. According to well-informed sources, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand had agreed on a draft proposal in preliminary talks yesterday, which was submitted to a formal meeting for discussion today. The proposal was initially considered by a limited number of British cabinet members, including two government legal experts, the Minister of Justice, and the Attorney General. Today's Prime Ministers' Conference failed to reach an agreement, and informal efforts will continue at the end of this week to unite all parties. The next formal meeting is scheduled for Monday.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] The leaders of the eight nations within the United Kingdom met on the 22nd to strengthen ties among Commonwealth members amid international turmoil and external Communist pressure.

<h3>Former French Prime Minister Reynaud Points to CCP Infiltration of Vietnam</h3>
<p>Chinese Situation Threatens French Interests</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] Former French Prime Minister Reynaud revealed here today that the Chinese Communist Party army continues to infiltrate Vietnam, aiding the Vietnamese communist army.

<h3>Dutch-Indonesian Negotiations May Break Down Next Week</h3>
<p>The Netherlands hopes Indonesia will propose a compromise suggestion</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 23rd] United Nations and Republic of Indonesia officials on the 23rd expressed concern that the conference here with Dutch authorities to resolve the Indonesian issue may break down within the next week. Dutch officials are comparatively less pessimistic about the peace talks, which began here nine days ago under the auspices of the United Nations.

<h3>U.S. Hopes French Government Will Reconcile With Viet Minh</h3>
<p>The War Hinders France's Recovery</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] According to well-informed sources on the 22nd, the United States greatly hopes that France can achieve a peaceful resolution with Vietnamese nationalists as soon as possible, as this resolution concerns the future of Asia and Europe. French officials have been informed of this sentiment of the United States. It is rumored that the U.S. has promised full support and possible economic aid to Bao Dai's Vietnamese government. However, well-informed sources neither confirm nor deny this information. U.S. officials believe that the rapid downturn in the Chinese situation makes a peaceful resolution in Vietnam even more necessary. Furthermore, the U.S. believes that the war waged by France against Vietnamese nationalists for the past three years has depleted materials and money, hindering France's economic recovery plan. Intelligence officials here say that Bao Dai will leave France for Vietnam "in two or three days."</p>
<h3>MacArthur Orders Announcement of New Japanese Yen Exchange Rate</h3>

It also stated that MacArthur's long-awaited decision "shows that Japan has made progress in economic stability."</p>
<h3>Representatives from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Canada, and Other Countries Unanimously Call for the Defense of Peace; The Paris Peace Conference is Filled with an Anti-War Atmosphere</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Canadian representative Endicott told the World Peace Congress here today that the land in northern Canada is currently being prepared as a long-range atomic bomb bombing base to counter the Soviet Union. We share the same shame as Belgium, forced to provide our abundant uranium resources to the mighty Uncle Sam for war and destruction, instead of for the benefit of mankind.</p>
<p>Endicott, who grew up in China and preached there for many years, said that many Canadians understand the importance of developments in China. The British cruiser recently driven out of the Yangtze River by the Chinese People's Liberation Army was actually driven out by American and Canadian weapons. Undoubtedly, when Churchill presents his annual report to the American shareholders of the British Empire again, he will lament that the Marshall Aid plan to China has caused serious losses to British interests in China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 23rd] At today's meeting of the World Peace Congress, the Secretary-General of the African Democratic Association, Da Brazilia, spoke, praising the CCP's "victorious advance" into Nanjing. Madame Leclerc, representative of the French Women's Alliance, spoke, urging France to stop the war in Vietnam. An American Black writer accused the United States of being power-hungry and leading the world into the hell of neo-colonialism. American labor leader Hanson said that the main base of world imperialism is in Washington.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] As the Soviet representative addressed the World Peace Congress today, he said that the Soviet people do not want to attack anyone and deeply abhor war. Soviet representative Nicholas stated that the Russian Orthodox Church believes that every Christian has the sacred duty to oppose war by all means. The Orthodox Church believes that the will for peace will ultimately prevail. Madame Zola, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of Bulgaria, also said that the Bulgarian people also deeply oppose war. Bulgaria is fortunate to have Soviet assistance, which has enabled the government to be taken over by the majority of the people. British representative Hawken pointed out that the youth of the world have been sacrificed to war propaganda. Youth should be the greatest hope of the country, but in half of the world today, youth are being sacrificed. U.S. representative Hanson said, "We will never be easily driven into an anti-Soviet war or sacrifice our lives to Wall Street." Madame Legray, president of the French National Women's Association, firmly stated that if the United States wants the French people to participate in a trial of strength against the Soviet Union, it will ultimately be disappointed. As Joan of Arc said, "You can bind me, but you cannot bind the future of France." The most noteworthy speaker at today's meeting was Madame Cosmedemianskaya, daughter of Madame Zoya, who is regarded by the Soviet people as the French Joan of Arc. Madame Kosmedemianskaya stated: "Our country is engaged in construction work to repair wartime wounds. Our country wants a solid and reasonable peace in the world, but the aggressors are trying to exert all their strength to resist the Soviet Union. The war being prepared by imperialism is not only against the Soviet Union, because this war will destroy millions of peaceful families and plunge them into suffering. I hope that after the delegates return to their countries, they can inform everyone of the criminal intentions of the enemies of mankind, so that the peace-loving masses can unite to defend peace."</p>
<h3>Labor Union Leader Praises Stalin</h3>
<p>Speaking at the Soviet Labor Congress</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 22nd] The chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, Di Vittorio, said in an address to the Soviet Labor Congress that the Italian people need peace and friendship with other peoples, especially the Soviet people, because the Soviet people were the first to recognize Italy's value as an independent nation. The reactionary elements in Britain and the United States who are trying to drag mankind into a new war have forgotten that the world's workers need peace, and that the masses in all countries love and yearn for the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union is the guide for all oppressed nations. Di Vittorio also praised Soviet workers and Stalin, saying that the Soviet Union's historical victory is an example for workers in other lands. Every time the Soviet Union achieves another economic victory, it is "our victory and the victory of the world proletariat."</p>
<h3>Netherlands Receives German Territory Ceded</h3>
<p>[United Press, Amsterdam, 23rd] Dutch officials and police crossed the old German border on the morning of the 23rd to receive the 36 miles of territory ceded to the Netherlands under the recent agreement between Western countries. The handover proceeded peacefully, and registration began immediately. The approximately 10,000 German residents, these "new citizens," will not immediately be granted voting rights and other rights.</p>
<h3>New Syrian Government Recognized by Various Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 23rd] Informed sources said on the 23rd that Egypt will recognize Colonel Zaim's new Syrian regime tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Damascus, 23rd] It was announced here today that the Lebanese government has already recognized Colonel Zaim's new Syrian government as led by the prime minister.

<h3>Large-Scale U.S. Military Exercise in Germany Enters Final Stage; Commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe Flies to England</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 22nd] A major exercise involving 7,000 U.S. troops in Europe entered its final stage today. The U.S. side assumed that a fleet of B-29 Superfortress aircraft flew from Britain to attack imaginary enemy targets in Czechoslovakia, and arsenals were also attacked, in order to destroy the arms industry in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. However, no aircraft actually participated in the attack on the arsenals. Ground forces were reorganized to drive the invaders out of the U.S. occupied zone.</p>
