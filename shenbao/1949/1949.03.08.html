<h3>今日立院將有質問戰　決定孫科內閣命運　政院昨曾召開談話會咸主相忍為國　施政報告分為兩在部份</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕孫閣命運如何，端視能否渡過八日立法院會議質詢難關而定。屆時孫科將率領各部會首長出席作施政報告。現時立院充滿強烈反孫空氣，預料部份立委將於施政報告後對孫大事抨擊，預料質詢問題必甚尖銳，而熊度亦必極為嚴峻。孫科七日全日時間均化於與各政委談話上，上午召開政委談話會，商討如何應付明日之難關，會中對於內閣是否總辭職問題亦曾交換意見。各政委咸主虛懷容耐，相忍為國，靜心聽取，良以今日局面維艱，在個人最好早卸仔肩，但基於政治上之責任感，不應輕言總辭，更不能於靑黃不接期中，陷政務於停頓。據估計立委中至少有三分之二係聯合反對孫科者，八日質詢中，將以在京立委為發言之中心。另有一部份立委鑒於時艱，主張略表緩和，然屆時格於會塲空氣，恐將吝於發言。據觀察者言，立法院會議中對孫科施政報告之質詢，縱極嚴厲，但尚不足以促成推倒孫閣，因孫如不辭職引退，立院固無權作成決議，迫使行政院長必出辭職之一途。政院副院長吳鐵城為商討施政方針及應付難關，已於七日晨由滬趕抵南京，出席當晨之政委談話會。七日晨政委談話會，係由孫院長親自主持，留京政委張羣，朱家驊，徐堪，洪蘭友，鐘天心，劉維熾，關吉玉，吳尙鷹，陳雪屏等均曾出席參加。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京七日電〕政府內部七日有迅卽指向政治危機之跡象，八日晨的一次辯諭，在立法院的簡短歷史中，足為值得記憶的一頁。反孫立委無疑將騁馳會塲，除預定提出的質詢外，聞立委對浙江省主席陳儀的突被免職，以及任命朱紹良為福州綏靖主任，陳誠為台灣省主席及方天為江西省主席等，亦將提出質詢。至於預定的質詢，則將集中在：（一）行政院的擅自遷穗及遷穗時的紊亂情形；（二）監察院對內閣若干部會首長的貪污凟職的調查；（三）渠個人與藍妮的關係，以及下令將政府查封的逆產發還藍妮的非法程序。同時由湖北籍立委及民主自由俱樂部，分別發起的要求孫科辭職的函件，正在傳送簽名中。立委並正準備要求行政院遷回南京的建議。據悉：孫科為取好於立院中敵人，早令停止任何政院機構及人事遷穗，並停止在廣州建屋。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕行政院長孫科八日將在立院提出之施政報告，共分兩大部份：第一部份為和平進行問題；第二部份為革新政治問題。革新政治中，復分列四點：（一）保障人民自由，（二）穩定財政經濟，（三）减輕人民負擔，（四）提高行政效率，其內容與孫氏招待記者時所發表者相似。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京七日電〕章士釗今日自滬返京後向記者談稱：對中共之正式會談亟宜迅速開始，否則上海和平使命團在華北與中共領袖交換意見所獲之成就，或有喪失之盧。另據此間觀察家稱：政府之遲遲不能決定和平方案，巳引起人之不耐，目前對於和平的樂觀成份，似巳遠遜於上海和使團自華北歸來之時。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京七日電〕立委代表數人七日下午曾訪孫院長，作最後努力以勸其自動辭職，但孫科告以渠將留任。另據可靠方面息：副院長吳鐵城決定於孫氏八日出席立院報告施政後，提出辭呈，不顧孫院長決定如何。傅訪謁孫院長之立委，有江一平及盧郁文等，孫氏曾與彼等談論軍事及經濟性質之事件，解釋現在情况。</p>
<h3>請政院回京辦公　速停止徵兵徵糧　立院列和今日院會議程</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕立院第三會期第三次會議，定八日上午九時舉行，議程內已將孫科院長之施政方針報告列入報告事項內。另一報告事項為郵資加價案。討論事項仍為李峯等一百餘人提請政院遷回南京辦公案，政院函告政府各機關遷穗辦公案及黃統等提請政院停止徵兵，徵糧案，預料孫科出席報告後，各委負必有熱烈之質詢，各議案八日是否能有時間討論尙成問題。</p>
<h3>調整鐵路郵電費　詳細提立院</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕行政院擬定之鐵路，郵電按照成本指數調整運價及資費辦法及相關實施辦法與試辦情形，咨請立院完成立法程序案，業列入八日立院院會議程中之報告事項，程序委會意見，由交通及財金兩委會派員會同審查，並請於一星期內提出報告。政院咨文中對此項辦法之擬定，叙述甚詳，謂該案經政院通過後，以立院正值休會期間，故先予試辦。按郵電調整已自二月廿一日起，鐵路自三月一日起實行，郵電資費並依照該辦法，於三月一再度調整。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕立委李峯等一〇三人提議，咨請行政院長暨重要部會首長·政務委員返京辦公，政務會議應迅卽在京復會，以利庶政，促進和平案，內稱：「查此次政院遷移廣州辦公，倉卒南徙，造成政務停頓，機構支離之現象，以致公務人員顛沛流離，政令無法推行，羣情惶惑，輿論譁然，為增強行政效能，安定全國人心，力謀和平實現起見，行政院院部會首長墍政務委員，實有尅日遷返首都，經常在京舉行政務會議之必要，爰提辦法如下：辦法首請行政院院長，重要部會首長曁政務委員遷回南京，主持政務，政務會議經常在京舉行」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕立委黃統等卅三人提議迅速停止徵兵，徵糧案，其理由稱：「徵兵自為世界通例，而亦抗戰以來衛國要政一。徵糧所以應軍需，似均不能廢，無如我國政治不良，兵役糧政辦理之壞，為人民最大痛苦，士氣消沉，民心離散，此亦一因，時至今日，對外戰爭談不到，對內則已息爭謀和，更無增加兵力採聚軍糧之必要。反之，正因作戰爭準備而啓猜疑，妨碍和談進行，更為不智，卽曰和平未至實現，兵不可一日不備，以目前情勢觀之，和如不成，戰可立起，新兵何日徵起，訓練又復需時，難救燃眉，徵亦無用，徒苦人民耳，徒失人心耳，徒阻碍和談之進行耳，徒損書生產之人力。財力，稽延建國之成功耳，何如停止徵兵·徵糧，解除人民痛苦，恢復國家元氣，果能以大仁·大智·大勇精神，立卽作此停止徵兵·徵糧之果斷行動，至誠感召，必能一新內外耳目，轉移人民心理，普遜振起人民之信仰，得到衷誠擁護，中共方面庶亦可渙然冰釋，同樣停止參軍獻糧，以爭人心之向背，雙方實際罷兵，大家眞心謀和，進而澈底裁兵，大量復員，一意於和平建國之大業，有利國家人民，豈淺解哉」。該案附列辦法三項：（一）政府首先自動的明令全國，立卽停止徵兵。徵糧，進談裁兵復員，從事生產建國。（二）政府能以事實昭示天下，一面向中共方面接洽，商請其同樣完全停止各地參軍獻糧運動，同樣裁兵復員，共謀建設。（三）政府以停止徵兵之命令及意義與裁兵復員之辦法及其理由，印布全國，由飛機人員投送，無間南北，以期迅速普遍傳達，家喻戶曉。</p>
<h3>穗立委聯誼會　座談當前局勢</h3>
<p>台立委代表出席報告</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州七日電〕立法院新聞室息，留穩立委聯誼會，七日午後三時舉行座談會，出席委員八十五人，公推徐淸泉主席，首由台灣推來代表倪文亞·白瑜兩妥員報告留台立法委員聯誼會之意見，繼各委負對各項重要問題交換意見，大致認為：（一）和平為全國人民一致之要求，亦為在穗同仁一貢之主張，惟吾人所期望者，應為全面的，眞正的和平，而全面的，眞正的和平，必須基於平等之原則，在和諧而自由之地點進行商談，方可使雙方在相互尊重，相互忍讓之情况下達到全國人民所需要的和平。（二）自前局勢艱危，稍一不愼，卽將陷國家民族於分崩離析之境况，吾人希望各方負責人士均應鎮定沉着，面對現實，精誠團結，同心協力，方能裨補國事，渡過此空前難關。（三）關於立法院此次集會地點，各地同仁旣有不同意見，故吾人始終認為在何地開會應取決於全體同仁之絕對多數，至一切議案，西本屆會議關係大局，至為重要，吾人更認為尤須尊重大多數同仁之意見，則所決議方可代表公意。</p>
<h3>立院談話會推定委員　草政治革新方案　整理和平問題發言記錄</h3>
<p>〔本教南京七日電〕立法院七日晨九時繼續舉行秘密談話會，出席委員一六六人，公推羅貢華為臨時主席，首由陳秘書長克文報告赴台灣經過，旋經各委員繼續對和談問題發言，副院長劉健羣並報告廣州方面情形，謂留穗立委對復會地點，絕無成見，休息十分鐘後，決定和平問題座談會可告結束，推定楊玉清，陳顧遠，江一平，黃宇人，張匯文，袁其烱，費俠，羅貢華，孔庚，許蟠雲，張靜愚，鄭震宇，甘家聲，文羣，黃建中，張平江，金紹先，盧郁文，樓亦文，羅　天，程滄波，苗啓平等廿二人負責整理連日發言記錄，再提大會討論。同時通過下午舉行政治革新座談會後散會。下午三時三刻續會，出席百餘人，對政治革新問題交換意見，仍由羅貢華主席，發言委員甚多，旋經推定李永懋，范予遂，朱惠清，張慶楨，邱昌渭，袁其烱，邱有珍，榮照，廣祿，黃統，鄭若谷，武和軒，陳博生，鄧翔宇，鄒樹文，周敏，崔學禮，張九如，劉錫五，易伯堅，楊幼烔等廿一人負責起草政治革新方案，并以鄒樹文為召集人，至五時半散會。</p>
<h3>立委昨續有報到</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕立委七日繼續報到者，有劉健羣，劉啓瑞，胡道遠，崔紉秋，戴慶輝，黃應乾，鄧公玄，鄧鴻業，高新亞，郭景廣，鄭自毅，劉次楓，張廷贊，韓振聲，姬奠川，王冬珍，詹純鑑，楊賓琳等十八人，連前共為三一一人。又留穗立委陸宗騏，韓漢藩等，六日有電到京，謂正在候機來京，出席大會。</p>
<h3>穗生活程度日高</h3>
<p>〔聯合社廣州七日電〕孫科內閣北返後，在此留下不歡迎之遺產，乃為生活程度之提高。月底孫內閣遷穗前，物價比較平衡。旅館房價僅及香港三分之二。頭等旅館三間房間每日不過美金五元，目前則每日需十美元，外加雜費百分之十。外國經濟專家認為，目前經濟改革方案，不能使金圓券穩定。</p>
<h3>政府決核減軍費　本月按四百廿萬兵額標準發給　希望再無吃空額之現象</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕政府已下嚴大決心，決於最折期內實施軍費核實。三月份之軍費經徐堪，徐永昌等數度商洽後，巳確定按四百廿萬兵額之標準發給。此項數字係以三月份為限，四月起之數字，財部希望再為核减，國防部則主張仍應增加。解決此項難題，孫院長已決定以最大之決心，完成軍費核實發給，務希各部隊中再無吃空額之現象。至核實發給之技術問題，卽將與國防部各主官及各地軍事首長商談，並希望每一部隊長體念國家之艱難，協助推行，惟軍費核實，決不减少兵額。外傳縮軍之說，實卽係軍費核實之誤。軍費核實發給後，以後軍費之數額，定可較三月份大為减少。</p>
<h3>和平方案待草擬　李代總統德取友黨意見　邀張君勱陳啓天等晉京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕政府方面起草和平方案之十要員，六日及七日因吳鐵城，張治中，吳忠信等因公離京，孫科，鍾天心，張羣，朱家驊等忙於準備政院對立院之施政報告，劉斐正與軍方人士接觸，搜集改編軍隊意見，故未開會商談。彼等最初發表之意見，經紀錄後，已大致整理就緒，日內將詳加研究，再正式起草方案，外傳和平方案已完成初稿說，據某負責方面稱，實卽係初步發表之意見整理就緒之誤。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕奉李代總統命赴滬邀民·靑兩黨人士入京交換和談意見之程思遠氏，已自滬返京，據程氏談，民社黨張君勱現患黃疽病，約一週後始可來京，靑年黨陳啓天及李璜等短期內亦將來京。李代總統為聽取友黨人士對和平方案之意見，故特邀請民·靑兩黨人士共商和談大計。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕政委張治中，七日尙滯留滬濱，惟行踪保持絕對秘密，其家人亦宣稱並不在滬。據悉，張氏留滬約三數日後始返京，目的在避免首都倒閣之政潮。至一度被李代總統屬意邀其組閣之何應欽，已於七日晨八時許自京飛滬。據其左右稱：何氏此行純為療疾而來，外傳在滬召開軍政會議事，絕對不確。何氏昨並未外出，惟據記者探悉，在立院猛烈之倒閣聲中，何氏悄然返滬，顯有其微妙之意義在。</p>
<h3>陳濟棠林翼中　聯袂赴港轉京</h3>

<h3>農地及都市房荒　將先作緊急措施</h3>
<p>吳尙鷹談土地改革問題</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕地政部長吳尚鷹談：我國土地改革問題，尙未踏上解決途徑，茲為應付迫切需要，擬對於農地分配及都市房荒兩項，先作緊急措施，其辦法，關於農地方面，將由地政部督導各省主管當局，依據土地種類，按照其生產力量，分別決定私有土地之法定最高額，其超出法定額之私有土地及依土地法不得為私有之各種土地，均限期依法征收分給於自耕農民。關於可耕之荒地，亦將分給於農民，由政府貸與資金，助其開墾。關於都市房荒問題，對於市區內所有可供居住及工商業使用之房屋，先行改善房東房客間之關係，撤銷居間人憑藉租費所為之一切剝削，至於如何執行，當係技術問題，應由地政部擬訂具體辦法，督導各省市主管當局切實遵照，期於短期內可收實效，，但以目前政局動盪，戰事尙未結束，所有政治措施，均面臨最大困難，無可否認，祗有依決定政策努力做去，以期達到光明坦途，與全國人民共同踏上成功之路。</p>

<h3>社論　公用事業計價單位問題</h3>
<p>上海公用事業加價計價辦法，繼政府財政金融改革方案而核准公佈實行了。考其辦法，乃所有水·電·煤氣·公共汽車·電話與輪渡等，均改按所謂「公用事業計價單位」（Utility　Unit）折成金圓收費。這個單位係以「關元」作聯繫，簡稱為　　，謔而虐者取其音而譯為「躍躍」，以形容其每天之必上躍。根據財金改革方案，關元係以美金四角為基數；根據「公用事業計價單位」所定，每一單位等於〇·六二五關元，這無異說每一公用事業計價單位即為美金二角五分。</p>
<p>上海各界市民與公用事業切膚相關，僉認以「關元」作計價之推算標準，不僅將領導物價上漲，加重市民負擔，並有造成幣制混亂之慮，故大都表承反對。市參議會為此特定於今日召開公用小組委員會，切實調查情况，搜集資料，準備與市公用局及關係各方重行研究改善辦法。同時，中央當局聞亦對此計價標準有所疑慮。看情勢，公用事業計價辦法可能於各界輿論的督促下，將有合理的改變，亦未可知。</p>
<p>上海各項公用事業，在物價上漲的情况下，成本加劇，經營困雞，隨時需要調整價格，此乃常理之事事，且亦不獨上海一市為然。不過，公用事業究應以服務為目的，而不應純以牟利為手段，收取費用必需顧全市民的負擔，而不能專從本身利潤上打算。假使因為公用事業是私人資本經營，不勝虧累是千眞萬確的話，，則政府在可能範圍內自應酌予貼補，或貸款。且公用事業價格，自採取自動調整的方式以來，一月漲價數次，收費時間亦縮短為數日，從維持業務的立塲說，自動調整是一種機動性的調整，已經很有利於公用事業，其所加於市民的負擔，也不能不認為相當的沉重，似無另創新的加價標準之必要，此次公佈財政金融改革案，原期以金銀平準市價，從而穩定金圓券的幣值，今政府所直接管理的公用事業，竟改以「關元」比例計算收費，不管予金圓券以打擊了。</p>
<p>所謂「關元」，即是戰前的「海關金單位」，專作進口商人繳納關稅之用，絕非一種可作為一般貨物交易的通貨。從幣制的關係說，「關元」乃一虛金單位，政府用以計算徵收海關進口稅，原為了保證稅收不遭貶值的損失，並不能視為一般貨物交易之計價單位。上海公用事業此次採用關元的六·二五折價單位，無異以美金作計價標準。這是在租界時代還未有行過的創舉。如果貫澈實行的話，流弊所及，不可想像，隨便說來，我們可以指出種種流弊發生的影響：（一）公用事業改按關元計價，它將為市塲交易行為開創一種先例，他如房租及一般物價等，勢均援例改變計價基數。抗戰時期的「關金券」一度當作通貨，使幣制無形從法幣變成「關金本位」，以這一事實說來，是期貨物交易的媒介，未來無形中又從金圓劵變為關元本位，并非不可能的事。（二）公用事業改按關元計價，不啻為變相之改取美金價格，此例一開，其他各種企業均可能以關元計價，甚至無論何種貨物域勞務，亦可以美金或關元折成計價單位，從而澈底抹殺了金圓的流通價值。（三）中央銀行收購美金，係按黃金與外匯市價折算，逐日掛牌；關元隨美金價格變，甚且一日一變，是則公用事業價格亦必逐日調整。故上星期五的ＵＵ為金圓八一二·五〇元，上星期六即為金圓八七五元，而今天八日的U.U.即跳到九八七元，時越三天，即漲兩成了。按往日上海的情形，公用事業價格上漲，結果必影響一般物價的土漲。如果公用事業計價眞參照關元作單位的話，今後關元一日一變，將顯示一般物價一日數變，而實際領導物價直綫飛揚。（四）現在一般商業市塲習慣及工人公敎人員之薪津收入，均以金圓券為本位，而以生活指數為金圓券價值增貶之指標。如果該項指標不以比照關元來代替，其影響所及，必將陷人民生活及金圓券之前途於絕境。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可知公用事業計價單位大有問題，自宜愼加研討，重行決定。若直以關元作標準，除了便利公用事業自身的利潤收入以外，對國家對社會的影響，實有重大的弊害。但是公用事業，為人民一日所不可少，故如何使牠們能够維持，確當費盡心思來實際策劃的。上海人民團體称市參議會希望市政府收回一核准」的成命，主張另定合理的辦法，是萬分正確的。我們深信吳市長和公用局趙局長必能從善如流，另謀妥善的補救辦法。</p>
<h3>江邊軍情日趨緊張　共軍續向國軍橋頭堡進迫　許世友部調至蘇北已證實</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京七日電〕江北共軍繼續向南移動，進迫長江北岸國軍之橋頭堡。口岸及三江營兩地，局勢業已不明。鎭江來電話並謂：儀徵南約一哩之三郎廟，昨夜亦曾遭共軍攻擎，瓜洲形勢仍緊，港口業已封鎖。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江七日電〕此間晚報今載稱：「江北岸之三江營有戰事傳來，情况不明。」惟迄本日晚間十時止，此間軍方當局尙未接獲駐防該地友軍之通報。又，常州第一綏區司令部對此間消息亦因未接到任何報告，迄記者發電時止，無法證實。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江七日電〕共軍淮海獨立旅及興化獨立團兩部，原係調赴東台整訓，刻又半路折回，重行開至至三汶河國軍陣地當面，原來接替該部共軍任務之淮河大隊及江都獨立團兩部，則分別後撤至楊州城西郊及南郊地帶。又，施家橋方面情况如舊，昨今兩無戰事，儀徽城北　蜡廟前昨兩日均有小接觸。</p>

<p>華北中共補充兵源</p>

<h3>李代總統夫人　發表「三八感言」</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕李代總統夫人郭德潔女士，頃發表「三八感言」一文，全文如次</p>
<p>一年一度的國際婦女節又到了，值此佳節，我人除以歡欣鼓舞心情迎接此佳節外，對面臨的國際紛爭，國內戰亂，仍不勝其悽惻與憂懼。目前國際間對立的璧壘雖仍未消除，但全世界人民的和平呼號已匯成一股不可拒抗的巨流，我們相信，這種努力終會將那些猜忌衝突的因素逐漸消除，奠定世界和平的基礎。其次，我國抗戰八年，繼之內亂三載，國脈民生，不絕如縷，此種是非功過，見仁見智，雖各有不同，不過兄弟　牆，弄到家破人亡，結果還不是老百姓吃的虧，試一暝思淮泗，東北平原，血流千里，人歡爭食，少壯流亡，老弱塡溝堅，而孤兒寡婦斷足折臂，數不勝數，這幅慘絕人寰的畫圖，誰不為之傷心淚下。政府鋻於連年內戰，民命不堪，以及世界人類共同要求和平的大勢所趨，故以最大忍讓，，決心弭戰謀和，力求政治革新，掃除和平障碍，例如釋放政治犯，開放言論，恢復民主政團活動，取消戒嚴令等便國利民的祥和措施，在在均足表示謀和苦心·這種苦心。直接固然為重整殘破田園，解除人民痛苦，復蘇國家元氣，間接也為了奠定東亞和平，免除人類重受戰爭威脅。</p>
<p>由於生理和數千年封建宗法社會的束縛，我大多數女同胞，一直被人看作奴隸商品，雖有不少知識婦女，取得較高地位，不過就業婦女在社會上依然受歧視。以兼理家務和獻身社會工作來說，婦女可說是負了雙重責任，這是值得驕傲的，我們有權籲請社會，予我們更公正的同情和支助。同樣的，我們婦女界想爭取敎育，經濟，社會地位平等，也必須固守崗位，以健全家庭，爭取社會福利為已任，拿行動事實來證明我們婦女對於應負家庭社會兩重責任，仍可勝任快愉，說明婦女的一切並不劣於男性。我認為擺在面前的，一方面要用理智克服自己的困難弱點，來和社會一切輕視婦女的思想制度設施抗爭，另一方面，必須認識內戰帶來的災害，使婦女們較男子感受的痛苦更為深鉅，因此我們要求和平的心也愈切。我想只要我們全國女同胞不分黨派社團政洽關係，共體時艱，深切體騐到婦女界由戰爭破壞所予的殘酷桎桔，我們運用智慧能力，太婦女界柔和慈愛賢良的天性，妻勸其夫，母誡其子，共同為和平而努力，一定可以化戾呈祥，使和平距離縮短，和平成果更加豐碩。和平是不可分割的，我們要求一勞永逸的全面和平，我希望全國女同胞各盡所能，推進和平運動，更希望國際婦女界給我們更多的同情援助，展開和平，賑孤養老，恤幼扶弱，各種社會救濟工作，使中國和平早日實現，遠東秩序賴以安定，則影響所及，世界人類亦蒙其庇。</p>

<h3>應付蘇聯外交新行動　西方國家會商對策　大西洋公約草案大體完成　英美法將開會確定對西德共同政策</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓七日廣播：蘇外長突由維辛斯基繼任後，西方國家深恐蘇聯將有新的行動，巳加緊提防工作，因而北大西洋之談判亦加緊進行。艾契遜國務卿特於今日下午三時召集參加談判之其他七國使節舉行會議，顯將就莫斯科此項決策交換意見。草約大體已告完成，約文中關於軍事之各種配合計劃，顯將成為東西衝突中之新的「賭注」。</p>

<h3>參會今日臨時小組會議　商討公用事業售價　反對以關元計算另尋合理調整辦法　公用局趙局長辭意甚堅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會公用小組委員會，定於今日下午三時，在塘沽路該會會所舉行臨時會議，對公用事業以關元計價問題，表示反對，並商討合理調整辦法。屆時並將請公用局趙局畏出席說明。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於日昨報載財政部電滬，希望停止公用事業以關元計價，俾免刺激物價消息，記者昨走訪公用局長趙曾玨，詢將作何措置，趙局長稱：市府迄今尙未收到財政部之任何命令，對上述消息，僅見諸報端，未知究竟。至於公用事業之決定以關元計價，亦屬於無辦法中之辦法云。</p>
<p>又悉：今日（八日）每公用事業計價單位合金圓九百八十七元五角，亦卽為「八一九」基數之九百餘倍，而實際上燃煤及燃油之上漲倍數，業經超出此數。按煤價於「八一九」時為每噸二十六元，現價已達十五萬八千元，油價「八一九」基價每加侖三角半，現價二千零八元，故各公司之困難確屬事實。據悉，法商電力公司昨向市府告急，因該公司過去素來維持七十天之存油，現為經濟拮据，僅有九天存量。又閘北水電公司以前向中央銀行貸借之款項，業經到期，惟因無力歸還，昨經請求轉期。蓋公用事業調整新辦法雖經實施，惟市民付款者為數不多，故各公司之經濟困苦情形，一時尙未能好轉也。</p>
<p>又據確悉：公用局長趙曾玨業已向吳市長提請辭職，辭呈抵市府後，市長本擬批以「慰留」兩字，經趙局長堅阻，故暫時擱置。聞趙局長辭意甚堅云。</p>

<h3>對財金改革新方案　市工業會呼籲三點　擬請取消貨物稅徵實等</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市工業會頃電行政院等，擬請對征實辦法取銷，對外匯移轉證辦法予以維持，其輸入品類分別禁止進口，暫停進口，增加限量進口。原電略云：</p>
<p>二月廿五日財政金融改革方案公佈，生產事業，莫不蹙額失色，其關係最嚴重者為貨物稅徵收實物，外匯移轉證之取消連鎖，及輸入之自由開放。查棉紡。毛紡·捲烟·水泥·火柴等業，均係出廠徵稅，負担素重，現在銷路本已大减，加以利息高昂，開支浩大，早難為繼，今乃一面對田賦停止徵實，而一面對於工廠貨物徵實，是何異迫害工業生產。再查三十八年輸出共祗美金二億四千萬元，加以僑匯收入，為數亦屬有限，而器材原料所需外匯甚鉅，且五六七八季限額，大多數尙未結匯，今驟行開放自由輸入，則外匯移轉證，有利可圖，加以投機者及國家行局大量吸收，以戔戔之外匯移轉證，致成奇貨可居，價格高漲，我工業界需用器材原料，則非出高價購買外匯移轉證不可，以致負担加重，是受害者又為我工業界，故勢非請仍行聯鎖制不可。又我國工業之脆弱，無可諱言，現雖各項工業略奠基礎，如予保護扶持，則未始不可蒸蒸日上，如再遇狂風驟雨，則立可摧毀無餘。財金改革方案中只規定准許進口及　止進口二種貨品，而對國內可以生產，而產量不足者，並無限制，如工業原料之酸碱及電工器材之馬達，近年來均有長足之進　，但以工資及原料之高漲，成太未能减低，尙不能與外貨並駕　驅。最近以戰事阻碍，各項製成品，不能暢銷，存貨高擱，週轉不易，凡此種種，已不勝壓迫之苦，倘此類貨品，自由輸入，漫無限制，則三十四五年外貨排山倒海而入之情形，又將重演，則在奄奄垂盡之工業，何異立卽促其窒息。綜上各情，事關國本民脈，不得不迫切呼籲，請於新方案施行條例中，迅賜注意補充，茲分陳意見如下：（一）取消貨物稅徽收實物，（二）維持外匯移轉證聯鎖制，（三）於奢侈品及國內已有充份生產之物品，完全列入禁止進口品類，國內原有生產，暫欠充份者，列入暫停進口品類，並請增加限量進口品類，按國內生產及需要情形隨時修正，認有不必要者加徵關稅。以上三點，國內生產存續所關，理合電請鑒核，迅賜採納云云。</p>

<h3>席德懋抵滬　赴美否未定</h3>
<p>白銀貸款事轉沉寂</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行總經理席德懋，昨日下午五時自港乘威爾遜總統號輪抵滬。該輪定九日離滬赴美，席氏行色匆匆，下輪後卽趨赴外灘中國銀行休憇。與席氏同來者有該行高級職員余英傑，林維英，戴志　等。據昨日赴輸埠歡迎席氏之該行某鉅公談稱：「我敢寫保票，席總經理不會到美國去的」。按自財金新方案准許銀元恢復流通後，中樞卽傳出將向美國貸借白銀，以便加量鼓鑄銀元之訊。而席氏留港時，曾與宋子文，徐堪，俞鴻鈞等一度會商，旋又傳席氏卽將代表我國赴美，洽借白銀貸款之事。惟美方初步反響，對白銀貸款似不感到興趣，且轉趨冷淡。故預料席氏在去美前，當有一番考慮。據另一方面消息：銀元公開後，中共雖禁止在其區內流通使用，但中共政府則正在力事搜求，以期套取政府區域之物資，政府對此正在考慮妥善對策；又美國國內白銀價格，較中國為高，設以白銀貸與中國，可能仍將倒流入美，此次白銀借款之事未獲成功，實興此兩問題有關。</p>

<h3>浙江的土地改革</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州六日訊〕前任浙省主席陳公洽胡事之初，曾舉行一招待記者的茶會，在強調確保治安增加生產後，記者曾為省府負責人邀請發言說：「依目前浙江的經濟情形，並不是工業的經濟，而是農業的經濟，今天不安的因素，要在農業經濟中去找尋，我們覺得土地改革，至為重要。」</p>
<p>陳儀決心實行浙省的土地改革，並且在卅七年底的一次浙省府例會中，正式通過了土地改革的計劃與辦法，他的</p>
<p>要點</p>
<p>如下：（一）限制土地所有面積最高額，除老弱孤寡及敎育慈善團體藉土地維持生活者，酌予保留耕地外，餘均分配與佃農，自耕農，使於十年之間，全省二百五十萬〇八千九百一十八戶佃農，半自耕農得於二千〇·四萬六千四百六十一畝佃耕土地中，取得自耕之地。同時澈底實行二五减租，合理規定僱農工資，保障未能升為自耕農之佃雇農。（二）土地所有面積最高額，五口以上之家為五十畝，五口以下之家為二十五畝，僧道老弱孤寡准保留非自耕地為每人五畝，每一宗祠為五十畝，超額土地以鄉鎮為放領單位，分配給原佃雇農及軍屬退伍士兵，及其他需地自耕之農民。（三）施行進度：第一期第一年開辦二縣，五年完成。第二年開辦四縣，五年完成。第三年開辦十一縣，五年完成。第四年開辦十一縣，五年完成。第五年開辦十二縣，五年完成。共應扶植自耕農八十四萬〇三百八十七戶，調整分配耕地六百六十萬四千六百四十三畝，第二期第六年開辦十三縣，五年完成。第七年開辦十三縣，四年完成。第八年開辦十二縣，五年完成。共應扶植自耕農戶一百六十六萬八千五百三十一戶，調整分配耕地一千三百四十四萬一千八百十八畝。（四）經費十年，共計以每畝五石食米計算，共需一萬萬〇二十三萬一千三百〇五石。並經府會決定，以杭州·嘉興。平湖一市兩縣為第一期第一年的實施縣份，並卽於本年開始實施。</p>
<p>陳氏卸任後，周奉璋氏繼主浙政，在他提出的浙江省三十八年度施政綱領中，特別列舉一則，說明繼續實施土地改革，其原詞如下：「實施土地改革，先行擇定縣市舉辦，以不擾民衆之</p>
<p>溫和</p>
<p>方式，達到耕者有其田。其未實施土地改革縣份，仍應澈底實行二五减租與限制地租，積極保護佃農扶植自耕農。」由此，我們要知浙省府的主持人都看到了目前晨村社會不安的　結，於是起而作這一措施。</p>
<p>以浙江言，杭（州）。嘉（興）·湖（州）·（卽吳與）三屬俗稱浙西地區，金（華）·衢（州）·嚴（州）·溫（州）·合（州）·處（州）·寗（波）·紹（興）八屬·俗稱浙東地區。浙西地區，適當太湖流域與錢塘江，黃浦江等之濱，故為一物產　饒土地肥沃的大平原。浙東地區多山，其中以四明·會稽·括蒼三山為最大，其山脈幾遍佈浙東各縣。</p>
<p>浙西</p>
<p>接近海口，地多山少，外來文化極多輸入，而彼此隔閡也較浙東為少，浙西雖擁有百畝以上田地的地主很多，但普通都將永佃權交與佃農，佃農獲得了永佃權，此一田地自能好好經營。所以養成了很多大佃農，卽將甲地主乙地主的田地都租得來，轉租與小佃農者，此大佃農當較小佃農為好，甚至較地主為好的。中國以往的土地制度，養成不勞而獲的地主，自從時代日益進步以來，地主的靠地吃飯已漸感困難。記者嘗在蘇州·嘉興一帶考察，該處本為地主階級的樂園，現在已很衰落。實施二五减租後，平原地帶的地主更受到很大的成脅，增大了負荷，加多了麻煩，所以在平原地帶的地主，已趨向沒落的途徑。代之而興的倒是大佃農，因為大佃農存在夾縫之中，反而可以雙方剝削。</p>
<p>浙東</p>
<p>情形完全相反，因為該處多山，外來文化輸入較慢，大地主較浙西為少，而沒有永佃權，因為沒有永佃權，佃農租了地來，必須好妤孝敬地主，否則，明年之地，不再租予。同時，地租價格，均由地主自定。地主雖土地據有甚少，而有予　之權，因以其一切較浙西地主為優。浙省推行二五减租最早，成績也最卓著，然而浙東有很多縣份，尙未普及推行，遂以養成地主更為優越的地位。</p>
<p>由以上這兩個比較，我們可以知道浙東的土地情形要較浙西來得嚴重，反映在現在的事實上，浙東的不安現象，自較浙西顯著得多了。</p>
<p>現在浙省實施的土地改革，第一期</p>
<p>試辦</p>
<p>縣份為問題較少的杭州·嘉興·平湖·兩縣一市，我們認為實施土地改革，必須針對當前問題最多之區，貫澈而實施之，使問題消弭於無形，使地方趨於安定。有人謂杭州·嘉興·平湖巳測量完竣，其他各縣多有未竣事者，然而我們應該一面迅速測量，一面積極實施，以免問題衆多地區的問題益形衆多，則將來實施時幾至不能着手·我們並非不贊同在浙西首先進行土地改革，而是浙西的土地改革，一面要把地主的地加以合理的分配，一面要减除大佃農的剝削·同時看到浙東情勢的緊急，問題的龐雜，似乎急須避易就難，對症下藥。</p>
<p>在浙省土地改革辦法的要點中，有僧·道·老·弱·孤·寡·准保留非自耕地為每人五畝一點，我們也有提出商榷的必要。因為</p>
<p>僧道</p>
<p>之為有閒階級，已有一般人所公認。記者於卅五年春訪問石屋洞時，遇一和尙，他大談其和尙必須從事生產的道理，語中有謂：「做和尙做到今天，不能再空吃白食了，應該盡一些勞力，以勞力來換取生存的代價，這才是人生的意義。」我們不能再養成游手好閒不勞而獲的有閒階級，故如僧道保留耕地，必須自耕，方為合理。又老·弱·孤·寡·的一般人，在現在的中國農村中，莫不也勤自操作，所指當為城市而言，旣為城市，我們應將老·弱·孤·寡應分得之地充裕救濟院的設備，來養活，更多老·弱·孤。寡。豈不更好？以上當也可謂為溫和的政策。</p>
<p>浙省士地改革已經開始，不過</p>
<p>開始</p>
<p>之初，應使廣大農民皆所領悟，避免中間人又在故弄玄虛，故必須與敎育配合，使知識份子以至中小學生，深入農村，作種種土地改革的講解。</p>
<p>當然，今天浙江的農村，也到了衰疲的境地，耕力離散，農屋與農具頻於破頹，我們在進行土地改革時，還須培養農村的元氣，改善農村的生活，充實農村的敎育，這樣才能使農村復甦過來</p>
<h3>嘉定槍榴彈爆炸　小學生四傷一死</h3>
<p>〔本報嘉定六日訊〕五日下午四時許，練西小學學生，在西北城河處拾槍溜彈，突然爆炸，四傷一死。出事後，記者前往調查，獲悉：駐軍在西北城角，舉行實彈演習，致有少數未爆發之槍溜彈，遺落於西北城河一帶，西門外練西小學散學時，學生一羣返家，行經該處，見沈姓菜園內遺有槍溜彈一枚。其中一人俯身拾視，詎轟然一聲，彈片四溢，人羣內五人應身倒地，血肉糢糊，慘不忍覩，其中　鳴，王秋濤，張根榮，陸啓亞四人，腿足炸毀，八歲之梁展雲，肚皮爆裂，腸臟流出，旋卽斃命。</p>
<h3>春遊木櫝鎭　四盜刧金飾</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州四日訊〕本邑南園鎭自衛大隊附郁祖鎔，二日偕同親戚女客二人搭乘馬車赴木櫝，郁等遊山畢，卽乘原車返蘇，不意車離木檁八里許，突遇四盜持槍行刦，該四盜原係剛才同車赴靈岩者。此次刦去金飾一兩餘，及郁之自備六吋手槍一枝，刦後往白馬澗逸去。馬車夫涉嫌，已解總局，縣府令吳西朱區長限期破案。</p>
<h3>青海「沙娃」初夏赴金塲</h3>
<p>〔本報西寗一日航訊〕靑海各縣對於赴金塲挖金的「沙娃」（卽金夫）以前有過命令：在今年農曆三月底以前，一律禁止赴金塲工作。靑海省政府近因這種採金工作對人民生活上很需要，現在已有命令下達各縣，准這許多「沙娃」於農曆四月初赴金塲開工。但是還不准走得太遠，如星宿海等處。</p>
<h3>無法印深造　馬宣道等返青</h3>
<p>〔本報西寗三日航訊〕前由靑海省政府資助保送赴印度深造的靑年阿衡馬宣道等四人，於去年十月間飛滬，擬轉飛印度，後來因為國事變化，出國手續不容易辦到，遂決定中止出國，現在，他們已回到西寗來了。</p>
<h3>黔省修文匪風熾</h3>
<p>〔本報貴陽二日航訊〕距離貴陽不及百里的修文縣，最近鬧出大亂子來了。該縣省參議負馬懷麟，田糧處長徐天恩竟在距縣城不遠的小靑鄉地方煽惑無知鄉民，高揭起「不納糧不當兵」的口號，以身邊自有的七八枝槍為本錢，由暴民力量繳獲了附近四五鄉鎭的保警隊槍枝，刻已擁有暴民五六百人，長短槍百餘枝，大有岡攻縣城模樣。馬參議員原來是國民黨在抗戰期間派在山東敵後工作的一員大特工，可算忠貞之士，勝利還鄉後，因政治上屢次失意，競選國大代表，省參議會副議長都未成功，不知他是何道理，在國民黨正過艱苦日子的今天突然來這一着。谷正倫主席不忍地方糜爛，現正敦促地方耆紳和在筑的女立委陳明仙前往勸告他不要亂來，一面調兵遺將，也來一個「備戰言和」，熟悉黔省政情的人說，這不幸事件，不難短期結束。</p>
<p>造成貴州不安定的癓結，實在是受隣省自由放任可以隨便種烟的影響，加上具有政治野心的人從而煽動，鄉民無知，當然蠢蠶思動。全省七十九縣新任的縣長多屬軍人，倘能以政治配合軍事，貴州的匪患仍然是不難平息。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋疑　典權回贖問題</h3>
<p>唐鳴時律師主答</p>
<p>邵愼奎問敝友某甲，其父乙於十年前將良田一畝二分，憑中保人典於某丙，彼時甲尙年幼，現甲已成年，查悉是項契約早已滿期，擬行回贖，奈家父及中保人等均已亡故，乏人證明。雖屢次請求丙方，均遭拒絕，更偽稱早巳賣絕。查上項田產，至今未經稅契過戶請問（一）不請律師可否向法院告訴？（二）典賣田契與賣絕田契有何分別？（三）丙方籍口距離典賣期限過久是否理由？</p>
<p>〔答案〕（一）訴訟當事人自可向法院起訴，但訴狀撰擬，辦理手續，以及引據法律，整理事實，若聘任律師代理，當比較周到。非律師不能代理訴訟，訟棍且為法院所嚴禁。但當事人若自己通曉法律，自問可以勝任，則法律上固並不一定要聘請律師代理也。（二）典權為吾國特有之一種，民法有規定，與絕賣大有不同。（三）典產回贖時限等，皆在民法第八章典權內詳細規定，請購法律書細看便知。</p>

<h3>甘省革新運動</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報籣州三日航訊〕甘肅最近倡導的省政革新運動，原不是從現在才開始，過去歷任主甘的人，無不力主革新，強調進步。朱主席紹良的「從安定中求進步」，谷主席正倫的「從進步中求安定」，現在郭主席寄嶠的「從團結中求進步」，都是在要求革新和進步。張長官治中在蘭州文化界聯誼會席上，曾對「革新」發過極大的感慨，他說：「大家時時喊「革新」，革了這末多年，不知革在何處？新在那裏」？</p>
<p>他接着指出阻礙政府革新的是那些份子，呼籲頑固派當心被大時代的潮流所吞噬，所擊毀。現在也許是革新的</p>
<p>更好機會</p>
<p>吧，因為目前的時局是最艱鉅的，但也是最偉大的，西北尤其是甘肅這個小康的局面，造就了必須革新方可岡存的良機，所以郭主席寄嶠在上月下旬召集省隨各單位科長以上人員，舉行了幾次省政革新座談會，決心摒除一切障礙，改善人民生活，謀取全面和平</p>
<p>革新的項目很多，幾乎包括一切的省政業務，主要的有下列幾點：</p>
<p>人事革新</p>
<p>緊縮機構，使性質業務近似的歸併辦理，普遍裁員，鼓勵人才下鄉，充實下層機構。省府對被裁人員的出路，已有辦法，據說不致發生失業問題。</p>
<p>兵役革新</p>
<p>過去的役政，差不多形成窮人被征，富者得免的畸象，今後省府要簡化法令手續，降低征丁標準，縮小免役範圍，使人民公平的服役。征兵方式，將採取征募兼施，傭量的起用幹部人材，優待軍屬。</p>
<p>金融革新</p>
<p>恢復平時財政扶助金融，金融發展經濟，經濟充實財政的循環性，電新厘定白銀稅收，在使用白銀區域徵收白銀，以平衡預算，穩定貨幣。另外恢復銀幣鑄迭，解救幣制的厄運。</p>
<p>土地政策</p>
<p>土地政策革新：使土地漸趨於平均，對田地多的人課以增值稅，徵收都市土地稅，土地改革將先自榆中·永登兩縣實施。</p>
<p>社會經濟</p>
<p>社會救濟革新：已擬定一種各縣市各保互助方案，以安富濟貧。因為甘省貧富過於懸殊，貧者不得救，富者也不得安，所以要平均財富，溫和的實施社會政策。</p>
<p>以上所報導的五項革新要點，有的己在省府會議中決定，有的還在縝密研討實施辦法，不過有</p>
<p>兩個方案</p>
<p>將提先實施：一為「自衛改革方案」，一為「財政金融經濟改革方案」，後者規定除恢復造幣廠（預計目前每日可製造二千枚）及印製輔幣外，並發行省公債，建設獎券等，以鼓勵有錢的人多出錢，渡過目前的經濟危機。</p>
<p>關於這次甘肅省政改新的前途，省府丁秘書長宜中曾在記者招待會上發表談話，他說：「革新的前途是樂觀的」。他分析</p>
<p>樂觀因素</p>
<p>如次：（一）要革新才能生存，不革新無論任何局面均無辦法。（二）要革新才能和平，根據政府種種跡象，和誠意使我們相信，和平終會實現。因為和平的力底均衡，現在政府是「備戰謀和」，而西北則是「自衛講和」，不管進程中經過多少波折和困難，只要雙方能</p>
<p>全國和平</p>
<p>的實現，只是時間問題而已。所以西北應該以革新的姿態配台中央的決策才行。同時，我們的政策和主義接近，才能迎接和平。</p>
<p>中央頒布財政經濟改革方案後，郭主席還特地發表了一篇書面談話，指出甘省有許多財經措施，早已與中央這次頒佈的改革方案完全符合，今後仍須照原定計劃加倍努力地推進，則一切問題都自然迎刃而解。他籲社會人士對這次省府卽將頒佈實施的各項革新方案，要切實宣導，人民須具有堅強的信心，則方案推行的成功，自然在預料之中。</p>

<h3>國行採取兩種方式　配售銀樓所需原金　昨日拋售價為每兩廿二萬八千元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國行已於昨日起，開始配售本市銀樓業　製飾金所需之原金。該有爲愼重並昭大信起見，特組織一小級委員會，專司審核配售價格，及數量之責。委員由監察院，金管局，中央銀行，中國及交通兩銀行之信託部，及金融平凖委員會，各派員担任。該行對銀樓所需之原金，今後將源源配售。配售之方式有二：</p>
<p>（一）由國行於上午十一時前通知銀樓業公會，由該公會轉知各銀樓開具所需購之黃金數量，於十一時前送交國行，該行小組委員會將價格決定及核定所售數量後，卽吿知銀樓，　於午後一時前携帶現款或國行本票前往購取，過時卽作罷論。</p>
<p>（二）國行於事前通知各銀樓，今日以何價拋售黃金，數量不予限制，任各銀樓自由購買。</p>
<p>該行昨日卽以第二種方式拋售，通知各銀樓金價每兩（含金成分爲千分之千）爲二十二萬八千元，但無人前往洽購。該行除以上二種方式外，如認爲某日不擬拋售或不配售時，則不吿知銀樓，申言之，是日卽無貨供應也。</p>
<h3>金銀公開市場　週內可能成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行總裁劉攻芸，業於昨晨在京公畢返滬。劉氏卽日仍至國行照常辦公。各界對劉氏此行，莫不一致寄予厚望，對劉氏在京請示經過，尤表關切。茲據該行發言人昨答覆記者稱：金銀公開市塲，現正積極籌設中，可能於本週內成立。國行對平抑物價漲風，決加强力量，採取積極措施，最短期內，卽可見效。至財金新方案內關於金融部份之實施細則，一部份己付實施。他如設立金融公開市塲案，日內亦將陸續公佈實施。至於發行一千元面額之金圓券，國行早經奉准公吿發行。又外傳華北近有大批金圓券流滬一節，據該發言人解釋，華北金圖劵總額有限，零星滲透，勢所難免。但因運輸限制及檢查關係，大量流滬，似不可能。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於籌設本市金銀公開市塲問題，自財部與國行會同開始籌備以來，己漸具體化。國行總裁劉攻芸，前日晋京時曾與財長徐堪商談頗久，進行步驟，辦法等均己決定。劉氏昨晨返滬後，幷曾再召金業公會與銀樓業公會負責人談話，商談市塲成立之各項技術上問題。據關係方面透露，如無意外阻碍，該金銀新市塲，本週內可望成立云。</p>
<h3>千元票尚未露面</h3>
<p>將視實際需要情形酌發</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日市上盛傳中央銀行新近公吿發行之一千元面額券，業已出現。記者昨曾向該行某機要人員探詢，據稱：一千元面額之新券迄未發出。將來當視實際需要再行酌發云。</p>
<p>〔聯合徵信所訊〕千元票面之金圓券，昨晨仍未正式露面。據國行發行局方面表示，是項大鈔一二日內卽可正式發行。至於目前之現鈔缺乏，主要原因還在物價之上漲與發行發生脫節現象所致，預計是項新鈔上市後，現鈔恐慌當可改善。</p>
<p>中央銀行昨（七日）對各分莊提取現鈔仍限爲百分之三十。據該行負責人表示，該行正積極設法中，鈔荒現象卽可解除。</p>
<h3>行局繼續差出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨繼續差出六八七八四墓元，洋商各行差入七三五七二萬元，大交換各行差入一一四二二八萬元，小交換各行差出一一九〇一六萬元。</p>
<h3>食米再升　粉糧食油又見上漲</h3>
<p>米市漲無止境，產價高昻，尤以南港產區價格，更與申市不合，故到貨甚少。昨早開猛跳三四千元，後市因圈外價平疲，進戶裹足，價乃稍回。南市塲白粳二萬五千五百元，軋升三千三百元，早薄稻漲二千五六百元。北市塲白粳亦開二萬五千五百元，漲一千二百元，薄稻漲一千八百元，特粳高達二萬七千元，二市到貨共計七千六百七十七石。</p>
<p>略見上揚，緣因央行有拋售物資及金鈔之傳聞，貨主居高思危，求售心切，初市曾見低落，收市後以金鈔大漲小回，人心仍昻，市勢重吿回升。老車初開做一萬零九百元，收市小落二百元，收市後散戶吸取甚力，回升百元。兵船做一萬零三百三十元，後市回做一萬零四百五十元，麩皮微升四百元，大包做八千四百元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>市勢續揚，黃豆先堅後回，漢口車豆初開上挺一百五十元，後聞油餅轉疲，廠胃轉淡，市勢回站原盤。乍豆未見做開，喊價約站二萬關，生仁挺升三百元，苞米略趨下游，紅糧上漲不多，芝蔴，綠豆實銷較暢，挺升各一成。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>價格，開市甚疲，因上週上漲太多，貨主乘高吐售，生菜油開市八萬七千元，旋敵戶又見低納取，價卽上挺到九萬四千元，收市終因圈外價疲乃亦回低，最後生菜油九萬二千元，豆油九萬六千元，各軋漲二千元。吉桶生油十一萬三千元，軋漲三千元，豆餅升五百元，長字餅一度抵達萬元，收市九千六百元。</p>
<h3>華股全面轉疲　台糖一牙跌停</h3>
<p>華股趨勢全面轉疲，各股初開以風聞央行將大拋金銀及股票，市勢巳見不振。中途雖一度爲證劵帮大戶拉高，終因銀根仍悄，行情再見急遽回降。永紗開盤五元，開盤後一路低檔徘徊，十一時許最低曾瀉至四元七角七分。十一時半，隔日大戶多頭極力拉高，市勢一路上升，最高曾至五元二角。逢高拋出，散戶跟進，市勢一路下　，直跌進五關內，做四元八角二分收盤。美亞亦趨下游，以一元九角開出，鄭重安板抬，最高做一元九角六分，多頭獲利了結，散戶紛紛反空，市勢直瀉至一元七角七分收盤。台糖績見不振，開盤三萬一千元，中途曾一度跌停，近收時因銀行帮有進，市勢稍被拉高至二萬八千元收盤。</p>
<h3>外股榮辱互見</h3>
<p>昨日外股榮辱互見，圈中銀根仍　，暗息七角有拆出，大戶買氣不殷，散戶亦咸抱觀望，惟洋行帮納胃稍健。怡紗做九千元，九千二百元，較上週末稍見回小一百元左右。英聯亦見軋小，做九百四十元，九百七十元。業廣較上週六軋升四百元，做二千八百元，三千元。會德豐仍屹立堅檔，高做二萬七千元，三萬元，較上週六軋升一千餘元。</p>
<h3>紗價欣欣向榮　棉布低檔盤旋</h3>
<p>紗市向榮，華南方面需求殷切，本街複製業對於細紗殊爲垂靑，人心仍屬堅定，各紗再現新高。　四二支藍鳳過程起伏頗鉅，初爲一百五十五萬元，旋猛跳至一百八十一萬元之高峯，嗣以浮多獲利而售，價乃瀉至一百七十萬元結束，較週六挺十六萬元。四〇支金城亦升十三萬元，三二支銀月自一百十四萬元盤旋至一百二十三萬元爲最高，終爲一百二十萬元，軋漲六萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨初以八十六萬元開出，甫高見九十六萬元後，卽吿鬆落，終以八十九萬元收市，獨降一萬元。</p>
<p>二〇支雙馬微昂四萬元，其餘各檔如天女金城等亦跟上三萬元左右，一六支光明叩破八十萬元大關，最後以八十三萬元成交，一〇支除童子軍反跌一萬元外，餘皆露秀色。</p>
<p>棉布市勢明升晴降，晨初因報載國行繼續拋售大量金銀與物資，以收縮通貨，抽緊銀根，且新方案細則業已擬就，將於下次政務會議提出討論後，卽可公佈，致握貨者咸具戒心，本街大多採取觀望姿態。開後一度因利空消息濃郁，賣氣曾見蜂湧，近收廣東方面逢低不乏進取，最後微見回好。</p>
<p>初開龍頭細布三萬四千六百元，四君子元嗶嘰三萬三千六百元，中途各陷於軟檔，收市前者爲三萬三千八百元，後者三萬三千元，結果較週六午收各升二千五百元，但比隔日塲外喊價則挫二千元左右，午後趨勢轉昂，喊價大致較午收行情，加一天拆息。</p>
<h3>中紡售紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售紗，計開六種，共售一五一件，准購者七六戶，各支紗售價：計六支副日光卅六萬元，八支日光四三萬元，卅二支陽鶴一一二萬元，四〇支紅賽光一五六萬元，卅二支雙股喜鶴一四五萬元，四二支雙股立馬一六二萬元。</p>
<p>中紡公司減少紗錠</p>
<p>昨據中國紡織建設公司當局語大中社記者稱：自東北天津兩地易手後，該公司全部紡織廠之紗錠已减去約三分之一，前在東北之紡建紡織紗錠約有十七萬至二十萬，在天津之紡織紗錠共約三十餘萬，故僅此兩地已有五十萬紗錠爲中共接收。該公司最近因棉花來源缺乏，僅開之六十餘萬紗錠，約佔七成，而在靑島中紡紗廠之三十萬紗錠，亦因受原料短少之影響，生產亦大爲减少云。</p>

<p>國行貼放委員會於七日下午四時舉行第廿九次會議，由劉總裁攻芸主席，通過公用交通事業貸款入起。此外上海區工業貸款，並經決定繼續辦理。</p>
<h3>業界主張取消　工業原料限額</h3>
<p>進口原料加工襲造後　成品出口應免進口稅</p>
<p>財金改革方案公佈後，輸入限額及管制均放寬甚多。但本市工業原料業方面，認爲此項管制的太嚴。彼等主張取消工業原料限額，准許工業原料自由輸入。因工業原料目前國內能自給自足者尙少。且有一部份國內尙不能製造者，用戶又極多。過去輸入者，均不够分配，爲求發展國內工業計，工業原料限額，有取消必要云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市工業會推廣外銷委員會，七日午後假中國紡建公司召開第一組會議，出席吳味經，歐陽崙，傅良駿，陳陶心等多人，討論經過，決議：凡用進口之外貨原料（限於國內產量不足或根本無生產之原料）在國內加工製成成品出口者，其進口關稅，應請求全部豁免。</p>
<h3>煤荒漸告解決</h3>
<p>上海嚴重之煤荒，因華北通航物資，交換漸吿解決。上月份本市共運達煤八萬零二百七十四噸。其中由開灤運抵者一二一〇〇噸，蘇聯煤一五七六〇噸，台煤二七一四噸。本月份煤量則以華北爲重，預計開灤一地卽可運到五萬餘噸，台煤四萬餘噸，印煤萬餘噸，蘇聯煤二萬噸，尙有其他部份萬噸，總數將達十四萬噸·是項煤斤運滬後，卽分別按實際需要，迅速配出。上海需十黨噸，南京三　唱。</p>
<h3>桐油先堅後回</h3>
<p>桐油昨市漲風愈演愈烈，原因爲業外物品猛晋，業中頭寸泛濫，貨主一致仰天討價，過程邁步向前，以迄午後，足度白油及正脾西洪，高叩七萬八千元，副牌西洪與靑油，亦較上週軋升八千至萬元有奇，而至晚收，因銀根頻緊，各物轉平，遂亦跟隨帶穩，前途可望站定。</p>
<h3>輸出入管委會　促進中埃貿易</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出入管理委員會爲促進中埃貿易起見，業輕商得埃及政府同意，特准該國進口商以英鎊向我國購買土產，如茶，芝蔴，紡織品，胡椒，烟草等貨品。並爲促成該項貿易計，繼將經營上項物品出口之各商號名稱地址，開單送請該國駐華大使館轉交該國進口商，並請該館亦將該國進口商號名稱地址開單送交該會，以便轉送我國出口商　茲悉：該會已接獲該使館函送該項名單，並已由該會抄送進出口同業公會及各有關進口商。凡未接得該會通知之各商號，有意經營該項貿易者，可逕向該會查詢詳情云。</p>
<h3>茶市軋升</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，晨初因人心堅俏，過程挺昻，旋以銀根鬆弛，買氣再度亢進，賣戶趁機力抬，市面益覺精采，價格方面，一致滿堂掛紅，惟迄攻市，突聞當局拋售大量物資，頭寸頓緊，漲風始戢，而與上週相較，軋升甚多。至查全日交易，受貨稀供缺關係，依然欲振乏力。</p>
<h3>證交今日起開拍　卅六年美金公債</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年美金公債第一及第二期債劵，證交昨已接奉財政部命令，核定於今日上市開拍。該項債券，票面爲美金一百元，與黃金公債同樣將分前後市開拍。其上市辦法如次：</p>

<p>金債昨在跌限收市</p>
<p>黃金短期公債市價過程微堅卽降，晨價一六九，〇〇〇元，次做一六〇，〇〇〇元，旋又低至一五二，〇〇〇元。近午急升至一六三，〇〇〇元，午收爲一五五，〇〇〇元，比上週六日計降一三，〇〇〇元，前市成交共一八三兩。</p>
<p>後市初做一五六，〇〇〇元，嗣做一五七，〇〇〇元，爲後市高價。旋低至一五一，二〇〇元，因降至跌限乃停，曾經自跌限回上，後又在跌限收市。半日成交計做十五兩。</p>
<h3>市塲散步　看客台</h3>
<p>只憑二把武器　虛拋一箭雙雕　攻心勝過攻城　西洋鏡未拆穿</p>
<p>週六午後漲風過鉅，所以大家認定週一開市，投機性市塲將受當局壓力，商品市塲也要帶住，果然，昨天眞是這般現象。</p>
<p>那末，當局眞有拋的力量，眞有控制市塲的力量了。也許是，更不是。因爲週六傍晚漲風，是受着渡江謠言的刺激，事實旣證明是謠言，漲力當然冰銷了。</p>
<p>講到當局拋的力量，也許有至少不値得認眞拋。老實說：只拋不進，才能把物價長期抑住，這是任何國家所辦不到的事。明知拋的效果，只能暫時抑一抑火勢，爲着未來再拋的準備，又不得不趁低收吸。此時此地，拋實貨易，收實貨難。拋出收不進，而火勢復燃又在意中，那末認眞拋，未免太笨了。</p>
<p>認眞拋旣不値得，但除了拋，實在就只好袖手旁觀，袖手倒底太不成話，沒有辦法中，便得想個辦法，那就是當局現正炙手可熱的虛拋手法。</p>
<p>怎樣呌虛拋，過去我們己經簡略分析過。那就是聲言拋金鈔紗布糖，實際拋金鈔只有其聲，而拋外匯移轉證是實。拋紗布糖雖非一派胡言，但是雷聲大，雨點小。打擊市塲的力量，全盤放在外匯移轉證上</p>
<p>外匯移轉證，和金圓券同屬紙也，印刷且不如金圓券，但滿紙蟹文，言明外匯，財迷心竅者一聽外匯，就　得着，信得過。此種心理，雖有其可宥之處，究令人齒冷。因而當局也榮得以毒攻毒之，凡認爲有出動彈壓市塲必要時，卽不問市塲有無人要，一味大量傾吐外匯移轉證，市塲需要者愈少，當局之跌價傾吐亦愈烈。不論有成交也好，無成交更好。外匯移轉證價可以連速喊小，便帶小了眞價實貨的金價，又帶小了眞價實貨的銀元，再可以脅住了證券，紗布及一般物價了。</p>
<p>這樣虛拋，雖然什九是有行有市的，但誰能知其眞相？唯其大家不明眞相，虛拋之計乃售。有頭寸的也都以爲銀根抽緊，濫扳高利，甲如此扳利息，乙也自然高扳利息。於是頭寸雖鬆，黑市利息依然昻漲。利息昂漲，囤貨不一定比拆放佔便宜。這種心理的發生，虛拋政策的作用，便全部奏效了。</p>
<p>投機市塲，和戰塲同。戰塲上軍事三分，政治七分；卽可操勝，因攻心比攻城更有力量。投機市塲，心理要素，關係更大。所以今日當局雖實行虛拋政策，比過去貝祖詒的眞刀眞槍上塲，性質上雖大不相同，可是攻心收效，虛拋也不見其爲虛了</p>
<p>可是西洋鏡拆穿不得，一且拆穿西洋鏡，那末儘管你大量傾吐外匯移轉證，大家漫不關心，都付諸一笑時，這把武器，便到了發銹時期了！</p>
<h3>僑匯收入又遞减　每週僅萬餘美金</h3>
<p>二月份收入總額减少達五分之三</p>
<p>據中國鋇行悉，最近僑匯收入遽减，侮星期僅能收得萬餘美金。較之過去，相差懸殊。去年自幣制改革後，僑匯收入卽逐有增多，至去年十二月底止，每月可收入四百萬美金以上。去年十一月份收入曾達一千餘萬美金，幾與戰前水準相仿。然自本年度開始，卽日趨减少。一月份僑匯收入總數爲一百餘萬元，較之去年十二月份减少一半，二月份收入總額僅四十萬美金左右，較之一月份收入又减少達五分之三。至本月份將再度遽减。財政金融改革方案雖規定僑匯牌價按外匯移較證價格計算，但因移轉證之價格與黑市美鈔價格相差仍遠，致難以收效。僑匯收入，實爲國家一大外匯來源，若再不改善處理，僑匯收入之前途實堪憂慮云。</p>
<h3>絲綢平庸</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况走勢平賺，市上銀根轉緊，暗息突高，更以當局仍將拋售物資，抑平物價，業中恐銀根極度抽緊，連轉不霾，於是買氣不旺，市勢欲振乏力。</p>
<p>120號有光新貨卽期晨開一〇三萬，隔日頭寸一一〇萬，旋因各帮逢小有推，人心較堅，市勢一度喊高出一二〇萬至一二五萬，高後聞圈外黃金突回，喊價又見回小，臨收到前絲　於一二〇萬左右，終以一二三萬收盤。</p>
<p>生絲以昨日外匯證市勢鋒俏，買戶力進，優級晨開一六〇萬有供，　後黃金開後報小，業內銀根轉緊，市勢見軟，喊價低落五萬元。　因本術納　構起，做價再見上升，臨收前盤旋於一六二萬，最後市勢站穩，執戶板持，終以一六五萬元了結。</p>
<p>綢緞昨日市况尙健，走勢硬紥，初因原料喊高，人心頗挺，繼而金價回跌，銀根突緊，散多脫手，走勢微軟，惟業外紗布報升市勢續見跟升。美亞　面晨開七八萬，抬面起而哄托行情攘見盤升，一度喊高至七九萬而至八〇萬，高後因銀根轉緊，塲外拆息做高至八〇元，浮多深具戒心，散戶了售尤繁，市勢轉入軟檔，低至七七萬元，　後卽在低檔徘　，迄至臨收得棉紗棉布行情步高，塲上買意稍旺，惟因配貨關係，同業互軋頭寸，拉抬乏力，午收時以七九結束。</p>

<h3>喬路易自傳（四）</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍譯</p>
<p>一九三八年戰勝許墨林後，這年中我就不曾再上戰塲。我用我贏來的錢，着實過了一些好日子。有人說我簡這是胡亂花錢，其實不然。我組織了一個壘球隊，就命名為「褐色轟炸機」隊，我打第一壘。我們坐了長途汽車，遠征美國各州，吃的好，到處住旅館，一個壘球季節終了時，我整整為此花了五萬塊錢，我想這決不是浪費，我有我的樂趣！</p>
<p>我對那些壞運氣的老拳擊手，也週濟了不少錢。我想這事大概沒做錯。我又經常捐助底特律的婦女養老院。院裘養老的女人，有的年齡已達九十歲到一百歲，她們稱我為「兒子」。這樣算起來，我將近有二十位母親了。　當我有大宗的收入時，我又為了自己穿的奇裝異服，花了不少錢。這是因為我小時候穿的大破破爛爛了。有一個時期，我整整的有一百套衣服，全都是在紐約和好萊塢兩地定做的。通些衣服都穿壞了，我現在對這些奇裝異服巳不再感到興趣。我為大型汽車，也花了許多錢，可是現在也變了，我現在巳不常駕駛汽車，除非我忽地想起要離開大衆而遠走。那麼，深更半夜二三點鐘的時候，我也會跳上了汽車，一聲不響的開上好些時候，直到那要離開大衆而遠走的念頭打消了，才停下車來。</p>
<p>我又培植我的姊姊茀妮絲讀完了中學和大學，她現在底特律敎英文，她畢業時得到了歷史學碩士的學位。茀妮絲很有頭腦，我深以她為榮。還有，我為兄弟姊妹們在底待律買了許多房屋。我跟瑪芙又在支加哥買了整幢公寓房子，這公寓收的租倒很可觀。</p>
<p>但我做生意也有蝕本的時候。例如，在支加哥我接盤了一家咖啡店，就虧蝕了四萬元。又在東底特律經營的一家酒排間，也蝕本二萬五千元。</p>
<p>美國徵兵時，我就在支加哥登記。有人說我可以找人替代，但我並不想事受任何特權。我祇要做個美國兵。我自動的服兵役，他們把我送到坎塞斯的拉萊要塞，我和他人一樣的受基本訓練，在陸軍部送我作拳擊旅行之前，我一直留駐在那裏。可是，這也就是我遭受到傷感事情的開端。當我還是阿拉巴瑪州的一個小孩子底時候，我根本不知道種族的差別是什麼回事。但我從不到那些有種屬歧視的地方去。在我各次的拳擎中，我也次次想法避免這種麻煩。在陸軍的隊伍裏，我依然保持老樣，因為我想我是個美國人，跟其他的美國兵一樣為國家而奮戰。我又想假設我是為人類的自由和平等而奮戰，那麼我將為這個標的而堅持到底。</p>
<p>可是，有一次在阿拉巴瑪州的西盤營地，我為要打電話叫輛出差汽車，偶然踏進一個公共汽車站裏去，那時我在汽裏前排的長凳上坐下來，就有一個憲兵走過來對我說，我應該坐到後一排的長凳上去，「那後邊的長凳是專為有色人種設置的。」我當然不願去，當時在塲的，還有一個中量級的拳擊手羅濱孫，他也是個黑人，當然支持了我的意見。那憲兵請了監督官來，把我們帶到一個營帳裏去，那裏的陸軍上尉，把我們敎訓了一頓。他說：「當一個憲兵要你做什麼事情，你祗有服從，否則，祇有自找麻煩。」我說：「先生，我是一個兵，跟任何其他美國兵同樣的一個兵，我不願人家為了我是黑人的關係，把我推趕到後排」。</p>
<p>這個案子後來轉到了華盛頓陸軍督察長那裏。結果一個命令下來，撤銷了軍隊裏公共汽車原有排座的歧視規定。但在軍隊之外，我仍是服從美國有關種族差別之原有規定。但在軍隊裏，人人都為一個標的而奮戰，當然用不着那一套陳規了。（未完）</p>
<h3>今晚籃球聯賽　仁餘首逢海青　女子甲一兩組形勢綠隊華聯分居首席</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽，今晚甲組三塲，甲一組主力戰為仁餘海靑，兩隊尙屬初度相逢，第一循環海靑因事請求改期，迄未補賽。仁餘靑年軍邇來表演大佳，進步神速，羣認為華聯之外，最有希望之一支勁旅。海靑由最近蒞滬之一美海軍艦史潑林菲籃球隊出席代表，實力可觀，其中有三個黑人，相當厲害，仁餘必須齊心努力，方可取勝，又將為一塲精彩比賽。市體育館門券照奮，秩序列下：</p>
<p>警機—無名（甲二B）五時半</p>
<p>紅騎—浦水（甲二D）六時半</p>
<p>仁餘—海靑（甲一組）七時半</p>
<p>籃球聯賽開賽以來，女子組甲一組均已晋入第二循環，各隊戰績女組綠隊五戰五捷，保持不敗，雄踞首席，黎隊五賽四勝，緊隨於後，將來冠軍一席，不出此兩隊。而綠隊之希望尤濃。甲一組華聯雖於前日不幸以一分之差受挫於培斐爾，但八戰七勝尙不足影響其第一名之地位，其次仁餘五勝二敗，僅較華聯遜一籌，滬警回力則同以五勝三敗並列，至其餘四個西人隊均告落後。茲將兩組最近形勢表列於後：</p>
<p>女子組</p>
<p>綠隊　五五〇一·〇〇〇</p>
<p>黎隊　五四一·八〇〇</p>
<p>星華　四二二·五〇〇</p>

<p>甲一組　賽勝負　百分比</p>
<p>華聯　八七一·八七五</p>
<p>仁餘　七五二·七一四</p>
<p>滬警　八五三·六二五</p>
<p>回力　八五三·六二五</p>
<p>恩卡斯　八四四·五〇〇</p>
<p>海青　七二五·二八五</p>
<p>培斐爾　七一六·一四三</p>
<h3>民主盃落選賽　磐隊今戰公交</h3>
<p>磐隊與公交於今日下午四時在南市球塲舉行民主盃中級組洛選賽，裁判岳仁孝，巡邊嚴有庚，臧文彬。比賽之優勝隊則定本星期五（十一日）下午四時與公和祥爭取落選冠軍，然後再與正選決賽中之失敗隊比賽，誰勝則誰為中級組之亞軍，卽可升格高級組，但洛選冠軍隊如在正選賽中曾直接敗於決賽之失敗隊者，卽喪失爭取全組亞軍之資格，而決賽失敗隊得逕稱亞軍，此乃該賽各歐代表會議之決議。　該盃賽幹事會通告：「為遵守代表會決議，明日滬對螢光及後天大夏對萬里之兩塲複賽，一律售入塲券三百元，希望該四朦負責人卽將明後日正式出塲陣綫於今日下午五時前送達體育塲」</p>

<h3>英海軍足球隊　明日友戰龍頭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英海軍倫敦號艦來滬，其足球隊上週曾在逸園與鐵路作友誼賽，一比一戰成和局。該隊明日（九日星期三）二次出馬，與龍頭作友誼賽，仍在逸園舉行，比賽於下午四時開始。</p>
<h3>菲國千五百公尺游泳賽　陳震南名列第五</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕單槍匹馬赴菲作戰之香港長距離游泳冠軍陳震南，星期六晚（五日）在馬尼拉國立黎剎游泳塲初次出賽。</p>
<p>這一晚比賽的項目，是一千五百公尺，除菲律賓游泳名手外，另有歐美「水怪」多員參加，合一爐而共冶」，端的是遠東罕見的偉大國際游泳賽也。</p>
<p>是晚參與決賽者，一共九員健兒。槍聲饗後，「肥南」下水略遲，二百公尺後，陳發奮力追，漸次趕上，二百五十公尺時，已與菲島長途游泳名將「馬巴士」並肩而前，祇差少許，但在他倆之前，仍有三數歐美「水怪」「水蛇」也。</p>
<p>二十九個塘泳罷，最後五十公尺各人發力向前，紛爭上游。陳震南於九員國際名將中，列第五名，在港菲埠際泳賽獲得八百八十碼冠軍之馬巴士則居第三名。</p>
<p>第一名的紀錄，則係二十一分三十五秒七，較諸陳震南在七屆全運所造的廿三分二秒三，快了幾分鐘。惟據與陳在港陪練的劉帝炳則謂：「陳在港曾造廿一分二十二秒八的優異紀錄。不過，這是在二十公尺短小的泳池所造的時間，也目不能作為定凖了。」</p>
<p>據查此次全菲國際泳賽，係根據世運業餘游泳則例而行，每項比賽採錄六名，是則「肥南」的第五名，仍入選位置，獲得兩分，不致「扛光蛋」而歸也。</p>
<p>六日晚八時，震南仍在黎剎泳池作第二次之出師，比賽的項目，則是四百公尺，一般人認為：陳長力充足，千五尺實較四百為有把握，此項恐更難取勝；但瀕行前，他底敎練黃少池少雄兄弟，巳預授錦囊，叫他在四百公尺賽中，必定要拼命爭先，因為「肥南」後勁可畏，而遠度未足，如果能搶得前導，也不難獲得較良好的成績也。</p>
<p>比賽時期，爭持甚烈，每一人之距離祗一掌之微或半個身位之差，大批華僑替陳震南打氣，故陳雖單人匹馬在岷比賽，仍不感寂寞也。</p>
<p>陳在菲比賽兩晚之後，將訪問岷尼拉中華靑年會，廣東會館，公使館，領事館等，並　受當地僑領之招待，遊覽兩三天，預　行程於本月九日，仍乘菲律賓航空公司客機飛返香港。</p>
<h3>港島球經</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕香港在上週未，足球比賽顯得十分鬧猛。甲組賽中覇主南南以四比零大勝陸軍。中華因陣容殘缺，和警察一仗，祗能各二扳成和局。巴士對東方之戰，東方則以一比四敗北。南華華與海軍，打個一比一平手。傑志和光華戰成一面倒，傑志凈勝四球。空軍以三比二勝了聖約瑟。</p>
<h3>運動世界　南南送陸軍四隻蛋</h3>
<p>南華南凈送陸軍四隻蛋後，照目前形勢，仍以二十戰，十三勝，五和二敗的成績佔居首位。</p>
<p>南華南</p>
<p>余耀德</p>
<p>張樹齡　候榕生</p>
<p>劉松生　謝錦洪　張金海</p>
<p>謝錦河　黎兆榮　朱永强　田協波　馮景祥</p>
<p>陸軍隊</p>
<p>晏打臣</p>
<p>那蘇　羅便臣</p>
<p>林斯基　奇歷乞　克民</p>
<p>般士　馬土甸　諾士　威斯脫　布郎</p>
<p>觀上列陣綫，陸軍雖然未能以全力應戰，但兩個後補員殊能賣力，在大塲之上，進攻力雖然不如在小塲面够犀利，惟在一鼓作氣時，有時仍能與南南以相當威脅，守衛力亦不弱，故強如南華，上半塲亦僅能勝却一球便了，下半塲若非那蘇與奇歷乞打起了火，頓失理智，及南南中人能利用大塲，設法將其集中力量打散，於中取利，則甚難勝來多球。</p>

<h3>中華幾乎斷送兩分</h3>
<p>中華隊中數員大將不出，多由乙組中人遞補，開塲時還東湊西補始能勉強成軍，使球賽延遲了數分鐘，開賽時排出陣容如下：余啓恩</p>
<p>余啓恩</p>
<p>可居</p>
<p>陳慶全　徐燦榮　虞華勝　張戰新　郭灼昌</p>
<p>反觀警察，又添新將一名，此人新由東方轉來，就是「靚仔」袁懼林，且陣容鼎盛，球迷咸認中華會兇多吉少，幸警察門將「黑仔」阿巴士昨天做了諸葛孔明，常擺出空城計，但「癲馬」盧華勝不做司馬仲達，得扳成平手的良機，不然中華白失兩分，毫無疑問，我們先看警察的陣勢：阿巴士</p>
<p>何成　馮北贊</p>
<p>劉榮光　候律　黎維</p>
<p>個喇素　袁耀林　烈民　曾錫康　吳汝威</p>
<p>照雙力的人馬看來，警察當比中華強，但上半塲警察全綫如散沙一盤，不但攻勢弱，守力亦未如願，使中華會能以一球先聲奪人，下半塲警察漸入正軌，一口氣取回兩只，不是「黑仔」阿巴士於最後一只漏接給華勝乘虛掩入，這個和局無法打成，中華會可說不幸中之大幸。</p>
<h3>巴士東方强弱懸殊</h3>
<p>巴士勝東方四比一，寫寫意意。東方後防兩老將，可說是黃忠嚴顏，但巳過了定軍山頭時期，劉義強是劉慶材的「仔」。看陣容，一望而知強弱懸殊，幸好東方踢球的興趣還不差。</p>
<p>看巴士那十一員是：</p>
<p>譚均幹</p>
<p>譯振輝　麥林福</p>
<p>馮坤勝　孔慶煜　鄧森</p>
<p>李大輝　鄒文治　鄧宜杰　李春發　錢熾芬</p>
<p>東方的陣容是：</p>
<p>楊彬</p>
<p>杯德　　江善敬</p>
<p>劉義強　李殿祺　黎其廣</p>
<p>黃柏雄　劉福銓　李惠林　鄧廣全　李洪祺</p>
<h3>傑志勝光華四比零</h3>
<p>光華踢來不濟，常被傑志戯弄於掌中，譚煥灼沒有上兩戰出色，傑志攻多守少，上半塲先奉鴨蛋兩枚，下半塲再送兩只，雖然光華前鋒拼力欲敲破蛋壳，但總無法攻破朱帮辦最後的一關，連不輕易得來的一只十二碼罰球，梁柏偉居然天后廟宴客，太失感情。光華之敗早在意中，但踢來迂迥滯遲是最大原因，臨門一脚總在猶豫中被人奪去，不然也可打進一兩只。</p>
<p>傑志隊</p>
<p>朱兆恒</p>
<p>莫錦松　霍耀華</p>
<p>羅偉權　游華興　李炳照</p>
<p>黃景聽　張松根　趙富　郭英祺　姚卓然</p>
<p>光華會</p>
<p>譚煥灼</p>
<p>梁栢偉　鄧汝濟</p>
<p>伍球廣　梁福松　黃子雲</p>
<p>羅德興　郭文添　劉偉民　伍潤沛　羅德福</p>
<h3>美戶內田經賽　決賽成績優異</h3>

<h3>關元計價有利無弊論</h3>
<p>— 馬丁</p>
<p>本市公用事業，自「配合財金改革」，實行自上海有史以來最最科學化，合理化之關元計價辦法以來，行見不久卽可物價下跌，天下大治，人民本應熱烈歡迎，竭誠擁護。但本人近讀各報，竟見對於關元計價之舉，頗多攻訐之辭者。這批人是否爲不法之徒，有意圖謀破壞此最最科學化，合理化的辦法，固不得而知，暫置勿論；但據本人詳細研究，公用事業以關元計價，其利至少可得五端，而其弊則幾乎沒有。何以見得？試聽吾言：</p>
<p>（一）計價之關元旣日日調整，時刻調整，換言之，卽金圓劵是以「正式掛脾」之方式，日日貶値，時刻貶値。老百姓自必大爲恐慌，急於要把時刻更不値錢的金圓券用掉。上午有金圓券到手者，下午卽用掉；下午到手者，晚上卽用掉。如此，中央銀行所發出的金圓劵，就不會被老百姓藏在箱子裏。金圓券旣不再被藏在箱裏，則市面上金圓劵將如車載斗量，籌碼從此充裕，中央銀行也就用不着時時增發大鈔，「以解現鈔之荒」了。如此，國庫局的發行，豈不自然停止，此利之一也。</p>
<p>（二）電車車票，因爲日日要調整，已不印明票價。查上海之電車，本已從無揩油之事，尤其是一路電車，更是石骨鐵硬，涓滴歸公。而從此以後，車票不印價目，揩油之事更將絕跡，因爲賣票的深懼冥冥之中，頭上三尺有神明，爲恐票價不印，此心吏難對天日，所以將決心永不揩油。此舉非但可使公司收入大增，而於上海社會之倫理觀念，尤大有帮助，此利之二也。</p>
<p>（三）電燈·自來水·煤氣以關元計價，日漲夜大，用戶自必被嚇得熱昏，不敢多用，以免破產。原來一日吃三頓者，改吃兩頓；原喝開水者，改喝冷水；原一星期洗一次浴者，改爲一年一次。如此，節約運動可不待大人先生之倡導而澈底推行於民間，而於物資之節約，更是彰彰在目，此利之三也。</p>
<p>（四）關元計價之後，最感吃不消者，當首推工廠。工廠用不起電，以得减少開工時間，或紛紛閉門。反言之，原料也就用得少，可替國家節省不少外匯，而市上物資，亦因工廠多停止搜購而大跌，物價從此穩定，　　之四也。</p>
<p>（五）公用事業旣收進的是關元，而付給負工的仍是生活指數，則自可獲利無算，皆大歡喜。且標準已定，從此不必再時時到公用局嚕囌，一向被「調整」二字弄得頭昏腦漲的公用局，也可從此政簡事淸，安坐納福，眞正實行所誚明八暗九十簽到，十點半鐘把茶泡，十一點鐘看看報，十二點鐘下班了。—此利之五也。</p>
<p>有此五點，公用事業之以關元計價，其有百利而無一弊，明矣。不過有一點，筆者還想提出改善之見，就是：公用事業的計價單位，只等於〇·六二五關元，未免太少，最好能「調整」至二·六二五或三·六二五。如此，則公用事業更加可以收入增多，盈利鉅萬，洋商哈哈大笑，—此於敦睦邦交方面，自然也是大有裨益的。</p>
<h3>男人看女人</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>「婦女家庭雜誌」前些時曾徵詢一些名男人的意見，問他們在初看見一個女人時，最先注意到那一點。這些名男人的答案各有奧妙不同，這裏摘譯數則，聊以表揚男人的眼光。</p>
<p>勞勃泰勒：「我注意她的走路。我討厭一個女子走起路來寸步難移，搖搖欲墮似的；或者健步如飛，像是一個競走家。在你沒看見她的面孔以前，只要看她走路的姿態，對於這個女人，就可以知這不少了。」</p>
<p>平克勞斯貝：「對於一個女人，我首先注意到的，是她的眼睛。如果它們閃爍不已，足證她富有幽默感，是一個好伴。」</p>
<p>亨利林克：「我看女人有兩種態度，一種是當晝看，一種是看她的個性。在飯店裏，在街上，或在其他公共塲所，我看女人是抱着欣賞畫片的態度。在社交集會中，我看她們侮人的個性。而個性卽是一個人使他人發生興趣。爲他人服務的種種習慣。一個女人對別人做的事，比對她自已所做的事，更能表現她自己的個性。」</p>
<p>麥克拉倫：「我注意手。不是手的樣子，而是女人怎樣使用她們的手。」</p>
<h3>天下小事</h3>
<p>— 由</p>
<p>馬來半島附近海中，產一種大蚌，有五尺寬，每只重達數百磅。這種大蚌，能食人，幼兒墮其亮中，決不能生還。巴黎聖色爾普斯敎堂中，有一枚這種大蚌的亮，作爲盛聖水的盆。</p>

<h3>三八節的起源</h3>
<p>— 寶珠</p>
<p>三八婦女節產生到現在，已整整四十年了。四十年前—一九一〇年，由於克拉克·蔡特金女士的號召，在丹麥京城開婦女大會，定三月八日爲國際婦女節。從比一年一度，　了全世界女性的節期。</p>
<p>克拉克·蔡特金女士，是近代婦女運動的創導者。她是德國人，在師範學校畢業後，就做小學敎師。那時由於產業革命的結果，資本主義漸漸成熟，勞資間的糾紛也從此發生，社會主義的思想也萌芽了。她那時結識了許多從波蘭和帝俄流亡到德國的人士，使她思想上發生了變化，參加了社會民主黨。後來德國政府爲防止社會思想的泛濫，頒布「　　會主義法」，克拉克女士也被驅逐出境。</p>
<p>克拉克離開了德國，和一個俄國人沃西普·蔡特金同居在瑞士，後來又搬到巴黎，度着流亡的生活。沃西普也是個敎員，在幾年的流亡生活中，得了重病。那時她己有兩個孩子，她爲了丈夫和子女，一面出去敎書，一面還寫些稿子，來維持生活。在這幾年中，克拉克女士受盡了生活上的煎熬，又遭遇流亡的痛苦，使她成爲被壓迫者的堅强的同情者，矢志爲被壓迫者而奮鬥。</p>
<p>一八九九年，沃西普的病日愈加重，不治而死。幸得那時德國的「反社會主義法」取銷，克拉克就帶了她的兩個子女返國。她回到德國後，創辦「平等婦女雜誌」，專爲被壓迫的婦女奮鬥。她鼓吹婦女運動，創導婦女福利。這工作維持有十三年之久。後來她又創辦「國際雜誌」，使婦女運動趨於國際化。一九〇七年，國際社會主義的婦女大會第一次開會，成立了國際社會主義秘書處，婦女運動於是更具體化了。三年後，卽一九一〇年，國際社會主義第二次婦女大會開會時，決定以三月八日爲國際婦女節。</p>
<p>爲什麽選三月八日爲婦女節呢？當歐洲婦女運動正蓬勃的時候，新大陸的婦女們，爲了爭取男女間的平等，曾集合了數千人，舉行一次示威大遊行。最初祇是芝加哥城的婦女參加，後來美國各地的婦女，都紛紛起來響應，那是婦女運動中一個最盛大的項目，引起了各國的注意。這事發生在一九〇九年三月八日，所以在第二年國際社會主義婦女大會開會時，就定三月八日爲國際婦女節。三八節從此誕生了。</p>
<h3>論自動調整</h3>
<p>— 郁强</p>
<p>調整早已成了漲價的文雅的代名詞。雖然它也暗示有跌價的可能性，但不幸竟祗是可能性而已。自從「調整價格」四個字聯用以來，始終是有漲無跌。</p>
<p>如今更風行「自　調整」了。從物價的趨勢看來，也就是說隨時漲價而不再「被動」了。在過去，一般的物價一向是隨時在自動調整的，祗有在限價時期，稍微受些約束。「被動調整」的物價，僅限於少數的公用事業，如今則全部「解放」，紛紛由「被動」而變爲「自動」。——依然被拘在「被動」圈子裏的，大概祗有「薪水」一種了。</p>
<p>公用事業中一馬當先的「自動英雄」，是以前素因價格調整牛步化而被小民所稱道的郵電事業。隨後脫穎而出的，是本市的公用事業，並且定了一個「計價單位」，表面上是以關元爲標準，間接的也就是以美金爲標準。從此以後，寄信有了欠資的危險，乘電車有了錢未帶足的窘事。</p>
<p>從不必再由主管當局核准這一點看來，公用事業的價格是自動調整了。但是，從調整的價格產生的方式看來，依然機被動的。臂如，郵電費的價格是以米，紙和汽油等計算的，這些被認爲是計算標準的東西的價格調整了，郵電費才跟着調整。假如再澈底的分析下去，米店和紙行等也各有各的成本計算公式。成本漲了，他們的貨物才跟着漲。如此追究下去，「自動調整」的元兇，也許是整個物價本身以外的東西。</p>
<p>不過，無論促成物價自動調整的元兇是誰，十餘年來各種物價互相看齊的行爲，却如無終點的馬拉松長跑，大家唯恐落後。這從單獨某一種物價的本身看來，正就是「自動調整」，—不要落在別的物價後面。</p>
<p>再回過頭來看看冷淸淸的被撇在「被動」圈子裘的薪水階級，他以三百餘倍的薪水，應付經過核定也有六百多倍的生活費用；現在又以六百多倍的薪水，應付不知精確的漲了多少的生活費用。不知那一天，他才會被解放出來，加入「自動」的馬拉松長跑？</p>
<h3>敎援之家：每况愈下</h3>
<p>— 少飛</p>
<h3>上海舊話之三　閑話天後宮</h3>
<p>— 古齊</p>
<p>河南路橋堍的天后宮，一般人都稱它爲天妃宮，是上海大家都知道的地方。但不知道天后宮，數百年來已是屢經滄桑了。</p>
<p>最早的天后宮，並不在河南路橋堍，而是建造在小東門外。據考據，那是在宋朝元符三年，卽西曆一一〇〇年，離現在已八百五十年了。天后娘娘本是保護航海的神，所以海上舟子，對於天后娘娘都是非常虔誠敬奉，許多老式海船，在船舶上卽舵師的後面，都有一個神龕，裏面供奉的就是天后娘娘，香烟終年不斷。據說，船在江中洋面，遇到狂風巨浪，卽將發生危險之時，只要祈求天后娘娘的佑護，就可逢兇化吉，一途平安。由此，也可見天后娘娘是和航行發生密切關係的幾個沿海重要商埠，如寗波·福州等地，都有天后宮的建造，而且都建造得十分莊嚴堂皇。</p>
<p>到淸咸豐三年，卽西曆一八五三年，洪楊之亂發生，天后宮也在戰火中被焚成平地。事平以後，閩廣等航商幫，卽集資在原址重建。但造成後不久，又因有小刀會之亂，天后宮二次被焚。原來那時的幾個小刀會首領，卽以天后宮作爲隱匿聯絡之地，淸廷前去捕捉，却撲了個空，於是把天后宮燒了，算是剷除巢穴之計。自此以後二十年間，天后宮就不曾重建。</p>
<p>光緒十年，卽一八八四年，又勘定公共租界鐵馬路橋北堍，重行募捐修建，這就是現在的天后宮。所謂鐵馬路橋，並不是因爲馬路以鐵舖築，而是因爲公共租界時建造蘇州河上的各座橋樑，最早用鐵條爲骨幹而上舖木板的，就是這座橋，所以人都稱之爲鐵爲路橋。自從天后宮造成以後，就稱之爲天后宮橋，現在的名字是河南路橋。但現在一般人，都稱之爲天妃宮橘，究竟何人最初把這個堂皇的「后」字降而爲「妃」，那就無從考據了。</p>

<h3>Today's Legislative Yuan Will Have a Questioning Battle: Deciding the Fate of Sun Ke's Cabinet; The Executive Yuan Held a Talk Session Yesterday, All Advocating Mutual Forbearance for the Sake of the Nation; Policy Report Divided into Two Parts</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The fate of Sun Ke's cabinet depends on whether it can survive the questioning ordeal at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 8th. At that time, Sun Ke will lead the heads of various ministries and commissions to attend and deliver a policy report. Currently, the Legislative Yuan is filled with strong anti-Sun sentiment, and it is expected that some legislators will launch a major attack on Sun Ke after the policy report. It is anticipated that the questions will be very sharp, and the attitude will be extremely severe. Sun Ke spent the entire day of the 7th talking with various political commissioners. In the morning, he convened a political commissioners' talk session to discuss how to cope with the difficult situation tomorrow. During the meeting, opinions were also exchanged on the issue of whether the cabinet should resign en masse. The political commissioners all advocated humility and tolerance, mutual forbearance for the sake of the nation, and listening attentively. They believed that the current situation is difficult, and it would be best for individuals to resign early, but based on a sense of political responsibility, they should not lightly speak of resigning en masse, let alone plunge government affairs into stagnation during a period of transition. It is estimated that at least two-thirds of the legislators are united in opposing Sun Ke, and the legislators in Nanjing will be the center of the questioning on the 8th. Another group of legislators, considering the difficult times, advocated a slight easing, but they fear that they will be reluctant to speak given the atmosphere at the meeting. Observers say that the questioning of Sun Ke's policy report at the Legislative Yuan meeting, no matter how severe, will not be enough to bring down Sun's cabinet, because if Sun does not resign and retreat, the Legislative Yuan has no power to make a resolution forcing the Premier of the Executive Yuan to resign. Wu Tiecheng, Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 7th to discuss policy guidelines and how to deal with the difficult situation, and attended the political commissioners' talk session that morning. The political commissioners' talk session on the morning of the 7th was personally presided over by Premier Sun, and the political commissioners staying in Nanjing, Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, Xu Kan, Hong Lanyou, Zhong Tianxin, Liu Weizhi, Guan Jiyu, Wu Shangying, Chen Xueping, and others, all attended and participated.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] There were signs of an imminent political crisis within the government on the 7th. A debate on the morning of the 8th will be a memorable page in the brief history of the Legislative Yuan. Anti-Sun legislators will undoubtedly run wild at the meeting. In addition to the scheduled questions, it is heard that legislators will also raise questions about the sudden dismissal of Chen Yi, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, and the appointment of Zhu Shaoliang as the Pacification Commissioner of Fuzhou, Chen Cheng as the Chairman of Taiwan Province, and Fang Tian as the Chairman of Jiangxi Province. As for the scheduled questions, they will focus on: (1) the Executive Yuan's unauthorized move to Guangzhou and the chaotic situation during the move; (2) the Control Yuan's investigation of corruption and dereliction of duty by the heads of some ministries and commissions of the cabinet; and (3) his personal relationship with Lan Ni, and the illegal procedure of ordering the return of government-confiscated enemy property to Lan Ni. At the same time, letters initiated by legislators from Hubei and the Democratic Freedom Club, respectively, requesting Sun Ke's resignation are being circulated for signatures. Legislators are also preparing to propose that the Executive Yuan move back to Nanjing. It is reported that Sun Ke, in order to curry favor with his enemies in the Legislative Yuan, ordered an early halt to any moves of Executive Yuan agencies and personnel to Guangzhou, and stopped building houses in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The policy report that Premier Sun Ke of the Executive Yuan will present to the Legislative Yuan on the 8th is divided into two major parts: the first part is the issue of peaceful progress; the second part is the issue of political reform. In the reform of politics, four points are further listed: (1) guaranteeing the freedom of the people, (2) stabilizing finance and economy, (3) reducing the burden on the people, and (4) improving administrative efficiency. The content is similar to what Sun announced when he received reporters.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] After returning to Nanjing from Shanghai today, Zhang Shizhao told reporters that formal talks with the CCP should begin as soon as possible, otherwise the achievements made by the Shanghai peace mission in exchanging views with CCP leaders in North China may be lost. According to observers here, the government's delay in deciding on a peace plan has caused impatience, and the optimism about peace seems to be far less than when the Shanghai peace mission returned from North China.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] Several representatives of legislators visited Premier Sun in the afternoon of the 7th, making a final effort to persuade him to resign voluntarily, but Sun Ke told them that he would remain in office. According to reliable sources, Vice Premier Wu Tiecheng decided to submit his resignation after Sun Ke attends the Legislative Yuan's report on policy on the 8th, regardless of what Premier Sun decides. The legislators who visited Premier Sun included Jiang Yiping and Lu Yuwen. Sun Ke discussed military and economic issues with them, explaining the current situation.</p>
<h3>Please Have the Executive Yuan Return to Nanjing to Work; Quickly Stop Conscription and Grain Requisition; The Legislative Yuan Lists It on Today's Yuan Meeting Agenda</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The third meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 am on the 8th. The report of Premier Sun Ke's policy guidelines has been listed as a reporting item on the agenda. Another reporting item is the postage increase case. The discussion items are still the case proposed by Li Feng and more than 100 others requesting the Executive Yuan to return to Nanjing to work, the Executive Yuan's letter informing the government of the case of moving agencies to Guangzhou to work, and the case proposed by Huang Tong and others requesting the Executive Yuan to stop conscription and grain requisition. It is expected that after Sun Ke attends the report, the committee members will definitely have enthusiastic questioning. Whether there will be time to discuss the proposals on the 8th is still a question.</p>
<h3>Adjust Railway and Postal and Telecommunications Fees; Submit to the Legislative Yuan in Detail</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The Executive Yuan's proposed method of adjusting freight rates and fees for railways, postal and telecommunications according to the cost index, as well as related implementation methods and trial implementation, and the case requesting the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process, have been listed as reporting items on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 8th. The opinion of the procedure committee is that members of the transportation and financial committees should be appointed to review together and submit a report within one week. The Executive Yuan's letter described the formulation of this method in great detail, saying that after the case was passed by the Executive Yuan, it was first put into trial implementation because the Legislative Yuan was in recess. According to the postal and telecommunications adjustment, it has been implemented since February 21, and the railway since March 1. The postal and telecommunications fees have also been adjusted again on March 1 according to this method.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The proposal by legislators Li Feng and 103 others, requesting the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the heads of important ministries and commissions and political commissioners to return to Nanjing to work, and that the political affairs meeting should be quickly resumed in Nanjing to benefit government affairs and promote peace, stated: "It is found that this time the Executive Yuan moved to Guangzhou to work, and the hasty move south caused a phenomenon of government affairs stagnation and the disintegration of institutions, resulting in government employees being displaced, government orders unable to be implemented, people being confused, and public opinion being in an uproar. In order to enhance administrative efficiency, stabilize the hearts of the people throughout the country, and strive for the realization of peace, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the heads of important ministries and commissions, and political commissioners, it is necessary to move back to the capital as soon as possible and hold political affairs meetings in Nanjing regularly. Therefore, the following measures are proposed: The first measure is to ask the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the heads of important ministries and commissions, and political commissioners to move back to Nanjing to preside over government affairs, and the political affairs meetings should be held regularly in Nanjing."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 7th] The proposal by legislators Huang Tong and 33 others to quickly stop conscription and grain requisition, stated that the reasons are: "Conscription has always been a universal practice in the world, and it is also an important policy for defending the country since the Anti-Japanese War. Grain requisition is to meet military needs, and it seems that both cannot be abolished. However, due to the poor politics of our country, the handling of military service and grain administration is the greatest pain for the people, morale is declining, and the hearts of the people are scattered. This is also a reason. At this point in time, there is no talk of external war, and internally, we have ceased fighting to seek peace, and there is no need to increase military strength or collect military grain. On the contrary, preparing for war will cause suspicion and hinder the progress of peace talks, which is even more unwise. Even if it is said that peace has not yet been achieved and soldiers cannot be without preparation for a day, judging from the current situation, if peace is not achieved, war can be started immediately. When will new soldiers be conscripted, and training will take time, making it difficult to solve the immediate crisis. Conscription is useless, only causing suffering to the people, losing the hearts of the people, hindering the progress of peace talks, and damaging the manpower and financial resources for production, delaying the success of national construction. Why not stop conscription and grain requisition, relieve the suffering of the people, and restore the vitality of the country? If we can immediately take this decisive action of stopping conscription and grain requisition with great benevolence, great wisdom, and great courage, our sincerity will move both at home and abroad, transform the psychology of the people, and universally arouse the faith of the people and gain sincere support. The CCP may also be moved to stop the movement of joining the army and donating grain in various places, similarly reduce troops and demobilize, and jointly seek construction. Both sides will actually lay down their arms, and everyone will sincerely seek peace, and then thoroughly reduce troops and massively return to work, focusing on the great cause of peaceful national construction, which will benefit the country and the people. Can it be understood simply?" The proposal is attached with three measures: (1) The government should first automatically issue a clear order to the whole country to immediately stop conscription and grain requisition, and then talk about reducing troops and demobilizing and engage in production and national construction. (2) The government should show the world with facts and contact the CCP to discuss and request them to completely stop the movement of joining the army and donating grain in various places, similarly reduce troops and demobilize, and jointly seek construction. (3) The government should print and distribute the order and meaning of stopping conscription and the reasons for reducing troops and demobilizing throughout the country, which should be sent by aircraft personnel, regardless of north and south, in order to quickly and widely communicate it and make it known to every household.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Legislative Yuan Friendship Association; Symposium on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Taiwan Legislative Yuan Representatives Report</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th] According to the Legislative Yuan News Office, the Legislative Yuan Friendship Association held a symposium at 3:00 pm on the 7th. Eighty-five members attended, and Xu Qingquan was publicly elected as chairman. First, Ni Wenya and Bai Yu, the two committee members sent by Taiwan, reported the opinions of the Taiwan Legislative Yuan Friendship Association. Then, each committee member exchanged opinions on various important issues, which generally believed that: (1) Peace is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country, and it is also the proposal of colleagues in Guangzhou. However, what we expect should be comprehensive and genuine peace, and comprehensive and genuine peace must be based on the principle of equality and be negotiated in a harmonious and free place so that both sides can achieve the peace needed by the people of the whole country in a situation of mutual respect and mutual tolerance. (2) The current situation is difficult and dangerous. A slight carelessness will plunge the country and nation into a state of disintegration. We hope that all responsible people should be calm and composed, face reality, unite sincerely, and work together to help the country and overcome this unprecedented difficulty. (3) Regarding the location of this meeting of the Legislative Yuan, colleagues in various places have different opinions. Therefore, we have always believed that the location of the meeting should be decided by the absolute majority of all colleagues. All proposals are extremely important to the overall situation of this meeting, and we believe that the opinions of the majority of colleagues must be respected so that the resolutions can represent public opinion.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Talk Session Appoints Committee Members; Draft Political Reform Plan; Organize the Records of Speeches on Peace Issues</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Legislative Yuan continued to hold a secret talk session at 9:00 am on the morning of the 7th. 166 members attended, and Luo Gonghua was publicly elected as temporary chairman.

<h3>The Level of Living in Guangzhou is Increasing Daily</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 7th] After the Sun Ke cabinet moved north, it left an unwelcome legacy here, which is the increase in the level of living. Before the Sun cabinet moved to Guangzhou at the end of the month, prices were relatively balanced. Hotel room rates were only two-thirds of those in Hong Kong. First-class hotels had no more than US$5 per day for three rooms, but now they require US$10 per day, plus 10% miscellaneous fees. Foreign economic experts believe that the current economic reform plan cannot stabilize the gold yuan.</p>
<h3>The Government Decides to Verify and Reduce Military Spending; This Month, it Will Be Issued According to the Standard of 4.2 Million Troops; It Is Hoped That There Will Be No More Phenomena of Eating Empty Ranks</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The government has made a great determination to implement the verification of military spending in the shortest period. After several consultations on the military spending for March by Xu Kan, Xu Yongchang and others, it has been determined to be issued according to the standard of 4.2 million troops. This figure is limited to March. For the figures from April, the Ministry of Finance hopes to further reduce them, while the Ministry of National Defense argues that they should still be increased. To solve this problem, Premier Sun has decided to complete the verification and issuance of military spending with the greatest determination, hoping that there will be no more phenomena of eating empty ranks in various troops. As for the technical issues of verifying and issuing, he will discuss them with the heads of the Ministry of National Defense and military leaders in various places, and he hopes that every commander will understand the difficulties of the country and help promote it. However, verifying military spending will not reduce the number of troops. The rumors of reducing troops are actually a misunderstanding of verifying military spending. After the military spending is verified and issued, the amount of military spending in the future will definitely be greatly reduced compared to March.</p>

<p>Wu Shangying Talks About Land Reform Issues</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Wu Shangying, Minister of Land Affairs, said: The problem of land reform in our country has not yet embarked on a solution. In order to meet the urgent needs, we plan to take emergency measures for the two items of farmland distribution and urban housing shortage first. The methods are: Regarding farmland, the Ministry of Land Affairs will supervise the competent authorities in various provinces to determine the legal maximum amount of privately owned land based on the type of land and its production capacity. Privately owned land exceeding the legal amount and various types of land that are not allowed to be privately owned under the Land Law will be requisitioned within a time limit according to law and distributed to self-cultivating farmers.荒Regarding reclaimable wasteland, it will also be distributed to farmers, and the government will lend funds to help them reclaim it. Regarding the urban housing shortage, for all houses in the urban area that can be used for residence and industry and commerce, the relationship between landlords and tenants will be improved first, and all exploitation by intermediaries relying on rents will be abolished. As for how to implement it, it is a technical issue, and the Ministry of Land Affairs should formulate specific methods to supervise the competent authorities in various provinces and cities to earnestly follow them, with the aim of achieving practical results in the short term. However, with the current political situation turbulent and the war not yet over, all political measures are facing the greatest difficulties. It is undeniable that we can only work hard according to the decided policies in order to reach a bright road and embark on the road to success together with the people of the whole country.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Issue of Pricing Units for Public Utilities</h3>
<p>The method of increasing and calculating prices for public utilities in Shanghai has been approved and implemented following the government's financial reform plan. Upon examination, all water, electricity, gas, public transportation, telephone, and ferry services are converted into "Utility Units" and charged in Gold Yuan. This unit is linked to the "Customs Gold Unit," abbreviated as UU. Those who like to joke and be sarcastic call it "Yue Yue" ("Jump Jump"), to describe its inevitable upward jump every day. According to the financial reform plan, the Customs Gold Unit is based on 40 US cents. According to the "Utility Unit" regulations, each unit is equal to 0.625 Customs Gold Units, which is equivalent to 25 US cents.</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai are closely related to public utilities, and they believe that using the "Customs Gold Unit" as the calculation standard for pricing will not only lead to price increases and increase the burden on citizens but also cause confusion in the currency system. Therefore, most people expressed opposition. The Municipal Council specifically convened a public utilities subcommittee today to thoroughly investigate the situation, collect data, and prepare to re-study improvement methods with the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and related parties. At the same time, the central authorities also reportedly have doubts about this pricing standard. Looking at the situation, the public utilities pricing method may be reasonably changed under the supervision of public opinion.</p>
<p>Under the circumstance of rising prices, the cost of various public utilities in Shanghai has increased, and their operations are difficult. Price adjustments are needed at any time. This is a common sense matter, and it is not unique to Shanghai. However, public utilities should aim to provide services, not purely to make profits. The fees charged must consider the burden on citizens and cannot be solely based on the utility's profits. If the public utilities are operated by private capital and cannot bear the losses, it is indeed true, then the government should provide subsidies or loans within the possible scope. Moreover, since the automatic adjustment method has been adopted for public utility prices, prices have risen several times a month, and the charging time has been shortened to several days. From the standpoint of maintaining business operations, automatic adjustment is a flexible adjustment, which is already very beneficial to public utilities. The burden imposed on citizens cannot be considered insignificant. There seems to be no need to create a new pricing standard. The recently announced financial reform plan originally aimed to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan by leveling market prices of gold and silver. Now, public utilities directly managed by the government are changing to calculate fees based on the "Customs Gold Unit" ratio, which is undoubtedly a blow to the Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>The so-called "Customs Gold Unit" is the "Customs Gold Unit" before the war, used exclusively by import merchants to pay customs duties. It is by no means a currency that can be used for general commodity transactions. From the perspective of the currency system, the "Customs Gold Unit" is a virtual gold unit. The government uses it to calculate the collection of customs import duties in order to guarantee that tax revenues do not suffer devaluation losses. It cannot be regarded as a pricing unit for general commodity transactions. This time, Shanghai public utilities adopted the six-point-two-five discount unit of the Customs Gold Unit, which is equivalent to using US dollars as the pricing standard. This is an unprecedented initiative that has not been done even during the concession era. If it is implemented thoroughly, the malpractices will be unimaginable. To put it simply, we can point out the impact of various malpractices: (1) Changing public utility pricing to Customs Gold Units will create a precedent for market trading behavior. Other items such as rent and general prices will inevitably change the pricing base accordingly. During the Anti-Japanese War, the "Customs Gold Unit Notes" were once used as currency, making the currency system invisibly change from legal tender to the "Customs Gold Unit standard." Based on this fact, it is possible that the medium of commodity transactions in the future may invisibly change from Gold Yuan to the Customs Gold Unit standard. (2) Changing public utility pricing to Customs Gold Units is tantamount to changing to US dollar prices in disguise. Once this precedent is set, other businesses may also use Customs Gold Units for pricing, and even any goods or services can be converted into pricing units in US dollars or Customs Gold Units, thereby completely obliterating the circulation value of the Gold Yuan. (3) The Central Bank purchases US dollars based on the market price of gold and foreign exchange and posts the exchange rate daily. The Customs Gold Unit changes with the price of the US dollar, even changing daily. Therefore, public utility prices must also be adjusted daily. Therefore, the UU was Gold Yuan 812.50 last Friday, Gold Yuan 875 last Saturday, and jumped to 987 today, the 8th, an increase of 20% in just three days. According to the past situation in Shanghai, rising public utility prices will inevitably affect the general rise in prices. If public utility pricing truly refers to Customs Gold Units as the unit, the Customs Gold Unit will change daily in the future, which will show that general prices will change several times a day, and will actually lead prices to soar in a straight line. (4) Currently, the general commercial market habits and the salary income of workers and public educators are all based on the Gold Yuan, and the cost of living index is used as an indicator of the value increase or decrease of the Gold Yuan. If this indicator is not replaced by comparing it to the Customs Gold Unit, its impact will inevitably put the people's livelihood and the future of the Gold Yuan in a desperate situation.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that there are many problems with the pricing unit for public utilities. It is appropriate to carefully study and redetermine it. If the Customs Gold Unit is used directly as the standard, in addition to facilitating the profit income of public utilities themselves, the impact on the country and society will have significant drawbacks. However, public utilities are indispensable to the people, so how to enable them to maintain themselves requires careful thought and practical planning. Shanghai people's organizations and the Municipal Council hope that the Municipal Government will withdraw the approved order and advocate for another reasonable method, which is very correct. We firmly believe that Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau will be able to learn from others' strengths and seek another appropriate remedial measure.</p>
<h3>Military Situation on the Riverfront Becomes Increasingly Tense; Communist Forces Continue to Approach the National Army's Bridgehead; Confirmation That Xu Shiyou's Troops Have Been Transferred to Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] The Communist forces north of the Yangtze River continue to move south, approaching the National Army's bridgehead on the north bank of the Yangtze River. The situation in the ports of Kou'an and Sanjiangying is unclear. A phone call from Zhenjiang also said that Sanlangmiao, about one mile south of Yizheng, was also attacked by Communist forces last night. The situation in Guazhou remains tight, and the port has been closed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch] The local evening paper today carried a report stating: "There are reports of fighting in Sanjiangying on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and the situation is unclear." However, as of 10:00 PM today, the military authorities here have not received any reports from friendly forces stationed in the area. In addition, the First Pacification Area Command in Changzhou has not received any reports on this matter, and it was impossible to confirm it as of the time this dispatch was sent.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch] The Huaihai Independent Brigade and the Xinghua Independent Regiment of the Communist forces were originally transferred to Dongtai for reorganization and training, but now they have turned back halfway and reopened to the front of the Sanwen River National Army position. The Huaihe Brigade and the Jiangdu Independent Regiment, which originally replaced the task force of the Communist forces, have retreated to the western and southern suburbs of Yangzhou City, respectively. In addition, the situation in Shijiaqiao remains the same. There were no battles yesterday or today. There were small contacts in front of the Wax Temple north of Yihui City yesterday and today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch] Regarding the rumor that Xu Shiyou's troops of the Communist forces have been transferred to northern Jiangsu, the military here no longer dismisses it as unfounded and has begun to collect information to verify it. According to reports, Xu's troops command the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Liangguang Columns, a total of five columns. Currently, it has been confirmed that the Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Columns have moved south (their positions are shown in the special dispatch from Zhenjiang in this newspaper on the 5th). It has been confirmed that the Liangguang Columns have been transferred to the Lianghuai area, while the position of the Ninth Column has not yet been determined. Military personnel believe that it may be the troops discovered by the Air Force on the Tongyu Line. Since Xu Shiyou was the former commander of the Ninth Column, if Xu comes to northern Jiangsu, his troops are also very likely to be transferred here.</p>

<p>Nationalists and Communists Both Reorganizing Armies</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] The Nationalists and Communists are currently reinforcing and reorganizing their armies to prepare for the possibility of resuming large-scale combat if future peace talks fail. The former Nationalist army divisions in North China are now slowly being absorbed into the Communist military structure. Fu Zuoyi's Beiping garrison is being screened, with most officers and soldiers joining General Lin Biao's command. The Ministry of National Defense is planning to recruit new soldiers in various provinces, and Tang Enbo, Commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, is expanding his forces to deploy along the Yangtze River line from Shanghai to Jiujiang. Bai Chongxi's troops are stationed west of Jiujiang, through Hankou to Yichang. Part of Hu Zongnan's army is slowly withdrawing from southern Shaanxi. Military observers with good access to information believe that the Nationalist government's military future is not optimistic, with inferior troop strength, materials, and morale. The Nationalist army commanders are studying two broad defense strategies: one led by Acting President Li, advocating holding the Yangtze River line, and the other believing that the defense line should be south of the Yangtze River basin. The Nationalist army's lack of economic power in South China, local opposition, and the growing shortage of materials are all insurmountable problems. It is heard that the Nationalist army will not engage the main force of the Communist army at any point along the Yangtze River. The Communist army's offensive force is currently included in four major commands: General Chen Yi's command, mostly near Huaiyin, with about 250,000 troops under his command, distributed in the area west of the Jinpu Railway and east of the Grand Canal, facing Tang Enbo's troops. General Chen Geng's command, with about 180,000 troops, has gathered north of the Dabie Mountains and east of the Pinghan Railway. These troops were originally Liu Bocheng's old troops. Peng Dehuai's 120,000 troops are holding the southern Shaanxi position and are currently attacking Hu Zongnan's troops. General Lin Biao's Northeast Army is the main force of the Communist side. Lin is using six columns to guard the north, and more than 200,000 troops north of Yexian can move south. It is heard that two of these columns, supported by artillery, have followed the Pinghan Railway to Yancheng, north of Hankou.</p>
<p>CCP in North China Replenishes Troops</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 7th Broadcast: According to broadcasts from CCP radio, the CCP in North China is actively seeking to replenish its troop strength in order to continue the southward extension of the Communist forces. Although the Communist Party has expressed its willingness to begin peace talks with the Nanjing government, from another perspective, the CCP is stepping up military preparations everywhere and mobilizing the people to "join the army." According to CCP sources in Beiping, "The People's Soldiers of the Northeast are currently being reorganized and trained in the Pingjin area," and the people of the Northeast, as well as the party, government, military organs, and organizations of the Northeast, are being mobilized to send a large number of condolence items and letters to encourage these new soldiers to "further develop their heroic and tenacious combat spirit, conduct revolutionary competitions with brother troops in Guannei, and liberate the entire China." It is learned that after the Northeast Communist Army commanded by Lin Biao entered Guannei, it is currently opening up the front line in the south. The CCP has been distributing shirts, soap, towels, and cigarettes to every commander and fighter of the Northeast Combat Army in the past few days, hoping that they will "strive to be good soldiers under Chairman Mao, persist in the revolution to the end, and liberate the entire China."</p>

<h3>The Situation in Western Hunan Worsens: Yuanling Peace Talks Break Down; Half of the City Reduced to Ashes; Chenxi City and Arsenal Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 7th Dispatch] During the Chen Lu peace talks, Liu Jijing, the speaker of the Yuan County Council, crossed the river at the request of the rebels and conveyed his opinion to Wang Jinxiu, the deputy commander of the security forces, requesting that the government forces withdraw from the south bank and retreat to Songxipu, and then negotiate. Wang insisted that the rebels must first withdraw from the urban area. The distance between the two sides was too far, and the talks were declared broken. Starting at midnight on the 6th, a big fire broke out in the city. By the morning of the 7th, half of the city had been reduced to ashes. Chenxi County and the arsenal fell on the 6th. At the beginning of the defense war, Chenxi had 2,000 civilian guns and requested that the government distribute the arsenal's weapons and ammunition to assist the government in combat. The government initially refused, but then approved the request. Unexpectedly, after the weapons and ammunition were distributed, the civilian guns did not fire a single bullet at the rebels but joined forces with the rebels. Currently, Baohe Township and other places in Chenxi have reported rebellion. The situation in western Hunan has reached a point where it is almost impossible to control. According to reports, the leaders of the rebels in various places in western Hunan are all local wealthy people who were disappointed in seeking official positions from the government in the past. Their purpose is to seek personal advancement, and there is no other political purpose and no unified organizational system.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 7th Dispatch] People from western Hunan who are living in the province recently exchanged opinions on resolving the western Hunan incident. They all believe that the rebellious areas have expanded and the situation is serious. Therefore, in the name of all people from western Hunan living in the province, they sent telegrams to Qiu Changwei, Xu Xiaoyan, Song Zhiyi, and others who are members of the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing, requesting that they immediately appeal to the Legislative Yuan and forward the appeal to Acting President Li, urging them to pay attention to the western Hunan incident and quickly seek a solution.</p>

<h3>Take a Look at Today's Northeast: People's Lives are Extremely Difficult; Communist Cadres are Corrupt and Engage in Internal Strife; Many Captured National Army Generals are Imprisoned in Harbin</h3>
<p>Remarks by Yang Hongguang, Deputy Commander of the Sixth Army Corps, and Others After Escaping to Qingdao</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th] Lieutenant General Yang Hongguang, Deputy Commander of the Sixth Army Corps, and Major General Huang Zhihe, special inspector of the war zone appointed by the President, who were captured in the Jinzhou Campaign, escaped from Harbin and arrived in Qingdao on the 3rd. Deputy Commander Yang told the Central News Agency reporter that after being captured, they were sent to a concentration camp in Harbin, where they were imprisoned for more than three months. Because of his serious illness, the Communist army allowed him to return. Senior generals currently imprisoned in Harbin include Zhou Fucheng, Liao Yaoxiang, Li Xianzhu, Fan Hanjie, Lu Junquan, Sheng Jiaxing, Zheng Tingji, Li Tao, Shang Fengwu, Zheng Dongguo, etc. Except for Zheng Dongguo, who is treated specially and imprisoned separately, the rest meet every morning and evening, especially the generals captured in western Liaoning who are subjected to abuse. He also said that inflation in the Communist area is also very serious, with prices jumping more than double every month. Taking the price of gold as an example, when they arrived in Harbin, each tael cost 4 million Northeast Chipi. When they left, it had risen to 12 million yuan. On their way from the Northeast to Qingdao via Pingjin, there were many beggars, and the people's lives were extremely difficult. The people of the Northeast not only have no meat to eat but also lack cooking oil, because soybeans are all transported to the Soviet Union by the Communist Party! Currently, the Communist Party is concentrating all technical personnel in Shenyang for training and has established an air force school there. During the liberation of Shenyang, there was a conflict between the military and the government, with internal factions engaging in open and secret struggles. Corruption among cadres is also widespread due to the universal development of liberated cities, and they all strive to enjoy life. This is a powerful explanation of what is so-called progressive political party. Yang and his party will rest briefly in Qingdao and then fly to Nanjing in a few days.</p>
<h3>Madame Li, Acting President, Issues "March 8th Reflections"</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Madame Guo Dejie, wife of Acting President Li Zongren, recently issued an article entitled "March 8th Reflections." The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The annual International Women's Day has arrived again. On this festive occasion, in addition to welcoming this festival with joy and excitement, we cannot help but feel sorrow and fear in the face of international disputes and domestic wars. Although the opposing barriers between countries have not yet been eliminated, the worldwide call for peace from people around the world has converged into an irresistible torrent. We believe that this effort will eventually gradually eliminate those factors of suspicion and conflict and lay the foundation for world peace. Secondly, our country has endured eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, followed by three years of civil strife. The nation's lifeline and people's livelihood are hanging by a thread. Although there are different opinions on the rights and wrongs and merits and demerits of this situation, the fact that brothers are fighting each other, leading to the destruction of families and the loss of lives, ultimately harms the common people. Just think about the Huai and Si regions, the Northeast Plain, where blood flowed for thousands of miles, people scrambling for food, young people fleeing, the old and weak filling ditches, and countless orphans, widows, amputees, and cripples. Who would not be saddened by this tragic picture? Recognizing the years of civil war, the suffering of the people, and the general trend of the world's common demand for peace, the government has shown the greatest tolerance and determination to end the war and seek peace, strive for political reform, and remove obstacles to peace. For example, releasing political prisoners, opening up freedom of speech, restoring the activities of democratic political groups, and canceling martial law are all peaceful measures that benefit the country and the people, fully demonstrating the sincerity of seeking peace. This sincerity is directly aimed at reorganizing the devastated homeland, relieving the suffering of the people, and restoring the vitality of the country. Indirectly, it is also aimed at laying the foundation for peace in East Asia and preventing mankind from suffering the threat of war again.</p>
<p>Due to physiological reasons and the constraints of thousands of years of feudal patriarchal society, most of our female compatriots have always been regarded as slaves and commodities. Although many educated women have achieved higher status, employed women are still discriminated against in society. In terms of managing household affairs and dedicating themselves to social work, women can be said to have shouldered a double responsibility, which is something to be proud of. We have the right to appeal to society to give us more fair sympathy and support. Similarly, if we women want to fight for equality in education, economy, and social status, we must also stick to our posts and take it as our responsibility to build healthy families and strive for social welfare, using actions and facts to prove that we women can still be competent and happy in assuming both family and social responsibilities, explaining that everything about women is not inferior to men. I believe that what lies before us is, on the one hand, to use reason to overcome our own difficulties and weaknesses to resist all thoughts, systems, and facilities in society that despise women, and on the other hand, we must recognize the disasters brought about by the civil war, making women feel the pain more deeply than men, so our desire for peace is even more urgent. I think that as long as our female compatriots across the country, regardless of party affiliation, social groups, or political relations, share the difficulties and deeply experience the cruel shackles imposed on women by the destruction of war, we can use our wisdom and abilities, and the gentle, loving, virtuous, and kind nature of women, to persuade their husbands and admonish their sons to work together for peace. Surely, we can turn misfortune into good fortune, shorten the distance to peace, and make the fruits of peace more abundant. Peace is indivisible. We demand lasting and comprehensive peace. I hope that all female compatriots across the country will do their best to promote the peace movement, and I hope that the international women's community will give us more sympathy and assistance, and carry out various social relief work such as peace, disaster relief, and care for orphans and the elderly, and support for the young and the weak, so that peace in China can be realized at an early date, the order in the Far East can be stabilized, and the world's human beings will also be blessed by it.</p>

<h3>In Response to New Soviet Diplomatic Moves, Western Countries Confer on Countermeasures; Draft of the Atlantic Pact Largely Completed; Britain, America, and France to Meet to Determine Common Policy Toward West Germany</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Washington, 7th (Broadcast): Following the sudden replacement of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov by Vyshinsky, Western countries, fearing new Soviet actions, have intensified their precautions. Consequently, negotiations on the North Atlantic Treaty have been accelerated. Secretary of State Acheson specially convened a meeting of the ambassadors of the other seven countries participating in the negotiations at 3:00 PM today, apparently to exchange views on Moscow's decision. The draft treaty is largely completed, and the various military cooperation plans mentioned in the treaty will clearly become a new "bet" in the East-West conflict.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The draft of the North Atlantic Treaty is nearing completion. US Secretary of State Acheson will meet again with the ambassadors of the five Western European countries and Canada today and tomorrow to discuss details and make final decisions. The foreign ministers of each country will then come here in person to sign the treaty before the end of the month. Diplomatic authorities believe that the full text of the treaty can be made public within this week. In addition, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen will arrive here on the 9th to seek a basis for participating in treaty negotiations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] The United States, Britain, and France will soon hold an important meeting here to discuss the West German issue. According to official announcements from the capitals of the three countries, the meeting is approaching and the agenda includes the following items: (1) The powers that occupying countries should retain after the formal establishment of the West German government; (2) The common attitude that Western countries should adopt toward the Soviet Union on the German issue; (3) Ways to strengthen the connection between West Germany and Western European political and economic institutions. The most important thing is how to consolidate Western unity to deal with the Soviet Union's future spring offensive. It is widely believed that the Soviet Union will take important actions within two or three months. Diplomatic circles are still trying to find out the reason why Vyshinsky succeeded Molotov as Soviet Foreign Minister, hoping to clearly understand the future development of Soviet diplomacy this week. For Western countries, this week is one of the busiest weeks in the Cold War. Keenan, the highest policy advisor to the US State Department, will go to Germany to conduct an on-site investigation of the US military occupation work and then report to Secretary of State Acheson for reference at the three-country meeting. Mr. Keenan is scheduled to stay in Germany for two or three weeks, so the three-country meeting will likely be held at the end of the month. At the same time, Mr. Heath, the political advisor to General Clay, commander of the US military in Germany, will return to the country within the week to preside over the newly established German Affairs Department of the State Department.</p>
<h3>British Government Decides to Convene Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference Early; To Discuss Communist Offensive in Asia</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] London, 7th (Broadcast): British officials said that due to the increasingly acute situation in the Far East, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference will be convened as soon as possible, while the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference originally scheduled to be held in Colombo in May is planned to be temporarily shelved. The last Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference was held in London last October. British officials said that the conference will undoubtedly discuss the Communist offensive in Asia. The situation has become even more urgent after the Burmese government rejected the mediation of the various Commonwealth countries. Observers believe that if the Burmese government reconciles with the Karen people through its own efforts, the consequences may not reduce the threat of the Communist Party. The recent situation in Malaya will also be one of the topics discussed at the future meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 6th] Nehru denied at a press conference today that he intended to interfere in Burma's internal affairs and had no intention of promoting a South Pacific Pact similar to the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
<h3>Southeast Asia Faces Crisis</h3>
<p>Concrete Measures to Counter International Communist Threat are Under Discussion</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The meeting held in New Delhi last week by representatives from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon, and Pakistan, seemingly unrelated to the Atlantic Pact, may actually be discussing matters that are part of the Atlantic alliance mechanism. The immediate goal of the meeting is to discuss the rapidly deteriorating economic situation in Burma and its repercussions on neighboring Southeast Asian countries, but just as the real problem of the Atlantic alliance lies in stabilizing the situation in the non-Communist regions to prevent the threat from Moscow and international Communism. The success of the Communist Party in China and the complete failure of American aid to the Chinese Nationalist government have put Southeast Asia in immediate danger of Communist invasion, and it is necessary to seek a group of resistance measures. The fact that this meeting was first initiated by India makes people believe that this resistance method is indeed under discussion. Although there is still a considerable distance from economic meetings to the connection of the entire Southeast Asian region, even if we only consider the situation in Malaya, Burma, and Siam, it is enough to make the non-Communist powers have to deal with the problems currently facing Southeast Asia urgently.</p>
<h3>Britain Decides to Arm Siam to Prevent Communist Threat; Siamese Claim Chinese Communists are Lurking in the Country</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] London, 7th (Broadcast): Siamese officials said that the British government has assured Siam today that it will provide material assistance to resist the threat of the Communist Party. Siamese officials strongly stated that there are Chinese Communist elements lurking in the country, and it is very possible to take joint action with the Communist Party in mainland China. British officials said that among the Communist elements in Siam, there are quite a few who hold important positions. Although Marshal Phibunsongkhram can currently control his 20,000 army, former Prime Minister Pridi Phanomyong is actually a left-leaning person and has the strong support of the navy. Phibunsongkhram is currently stepping up efforts to equip the army with British weapons and is rushing to build an air force. Air force personnel have all been trained in Britain, and the aircraft they fly are also British-made.</p>
<h3>Western Europe and the British Commonwealth Should Strengthen Their Defense Institutions</h3>
<p>Eden Delivers Speech in Australia</p>
<p>[Reuters, Adelaide, Australia, 7th] Eden, Deputy Leader of the British Conservative Party, was invited by the Australian government to visit Australia. He delivered a speech here today, strongly advocating strengthening the relationship between Western Europe and the British Commonwealth, and the relationship between these two groups and the United States. If this is done, the defense institutions so organized will be strong enough to resist attacks from any direction.</p>
<h3>British Fleet Holds Large-Scale Exercise to Test Gibraltar's Defenses</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Gibraltar, 6th] The British Home Fleet and Mediterranean Fleet departed from here tonight for a large-scale joint exercise. Its air, surface, and submarine forces will undertake actions such as cover, reconnaissance, and attack. The commanders of the two fleets are Vice Admiral Russell, Commander of the Home Fleet, with the 35,000-ton battleship "Duke of York" as his flagship, and Rear Admiral Mountbatten, Commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, with the cruiser "Liverpool" as his flagship. General McGregor, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, and Admiral Power, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, will watch the battle on the aircraft carrier "Indomitable" and the battleship "Light Cruiser," respectively. Lieutenant General Pannett will serve as the commander-in-chief of the joint exercise, boarding the aircraft carrier "Victorious." Gibraltar's defenses will be greatly tested in this exercise. The fleets are scheduled to return to the port of Gibraltar on Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Reports of Soviet Military Activity Near Sweden; Swedish Officials Issue Denial</h3>
<p>[United Press, Stockholm, 7th] Swedish military and political figures denied on the 7th the reports of Soviet military concentration in the Karelian and Baltic regions, saying that these reports were rumors that had been circulating from time to time in recent months. The "Stockholm Times" had reported that the Soviet Union was setting up rocket artillery bases, airports, and large garrisons in the Baltic region and the Karelian region.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Advisor Issues Stern Warning: Japan Must Quickly Seek Economic Self-Reliance; Otherwise, America Will Cancel Aid to Japan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] American banker Dodge, who arrived in Japan on January 5th this year to serve as MacArthur's financial advisor, held a press conference this morning and issued a stern warning to the Japanese government, stating that Japan must balance its budget and increase import and export trade, otherwise, the United States will cancel its aid to Japan. Dodge predicted that if Japan insists on relying on government subsidies to revive its economy, it will head towards bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Dodge has met with the Japanese Minister of Finance and important bank leaders. It is believed that he has completely overturned the budget plan drafted by Prime Minister Yoshida of the Conservative Party cabinet. He told the press this morning that the Japanese government should make responsible and difficult decisions in order to fulfill its obligations to American taxpayers. He hoped that import controls (most of which were initiated by the United States) would be sufficient to prevent 25% of the goods designated by the United States for export from entering the Japanese domestic market. He concluded by strongly advocating that Japan must implement strict plans to reduce the risk of unemployment. He also hinted that the United States plans to gradually reduce rather than gradually increase its financial assistance to Japan. The assistance has reached 1.25 billion US dollars from the start of the war until March 1949.</p>
<h3>Japan Panics After Dodge's Statement; Prime Minister Yoshida is Depressed</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] The statement made by MacArthur's financial advisor Dodge at the New Cabinet meeting this morning caused panic in Japanese political and financial circles. Prime Minister Yoshida is still depressed and remains hidden in his suburban villa and has been unable to comment on this statement. However, the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Finance revealed his disappointment and doubts about this statement. Japanese Minister of Finance Hayato Ikeda even hinted that he would resign after the budget is passed by the parliament because he cannot bear this blame.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Continues to Arrest Pastors; Number of Arrested May Reach Fifty</h3>
<p>[United Press, Sofia, 7th] A Bulgarian government spokesman said on the 7th that security police have now arrested more Protestant pastors. He said that the number of arrests "may" be as high as fifty.

<h3>City Council to Hold Special Group Meeting Today to Discuss Public Utility Prices, Oppose Calculation in Customs Gold Units, Seek Other Reasonable Adjustment Methods, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau Firmly Resigns</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Public Utilities Subcommittee of the City Council is scheduled to hold a special meeting at 3:00 p.m. today at the Council's office on Tanggu Road to express its opposition to the pricing of public utilities in customs gold units and to discuss reasonable adjustment methods. Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau will be invited to attend and explain the situation.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] Regarding the news reported yesterday that the Ministry of Finance telegraphed Shanghai, hoping to stop the pricing of public utilities in customs gold units in order to avoid stimulating prices, this reporter visited Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, yesterday and asked what measures would be taken. Director Zhao said: The municipal government has not yet received any orders from the Ministry of Finance, and the above news has only been seen in the newspapers, so it is not yet known. As for the decision to price public utilities in customs gold units, it is also a measure taken out of desperation.</p>
<p>It is also learned that today (the 8th), the pricing unit of each public utility is equivalent to 987.5 gold yuan, which is more than 900 times the base number of "August 19," while in fact the increase in the price of coal and fuel oil has exceeded this number. According to the price of coal on "August 19" was 26 yuan per ton, and the current price has reached 158,000 yuan. The base price of oil on "August 19" was 0.35 yuan per gallon, and the current price is 2,008 yuan, so the difficulties of various companies are indeed real. It is reported that the French Electric Power Company yesterday reported an emergency to the municipal government, because the company has always maintained a 70-day supply of oil in the past, but now due to economic constraints, it only has a 9-day supply. In addition, the loans that the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company previously borrowed from the Central Bank have expired, but because it is unable to repay them, it requested a transfer of the term yesterday. Although the new method of adjusting public utilities has been implemented, the number of citizens who pay is not large, so the economic difficulties of various companies have not been alleviated for the time being.</p>
<p>It is also reliably learned that Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, has submitted his resignation to Mayor Wu. After the resignation was received by the municipal government, the mayor originally intended to approve it with the words "retain," but Director Zhao firmly refused, so it was temporarily shelved. It is said that Director Zhao's resignation is very firm.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Groups Oppose Pricing in Customs Gold Units</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Since the city's public utilities adopted the method of pricing in customs gold units and adjusting them at any time, various factories have found it difficult to bear the high water and electricity bills, and it is also impossible to estimate future production costs. Various industries are shocked by this measure of the municipal government. The City Industrial Association specially convened discussions among various industries yesterday and decided to send telegrams to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the municipal government, the Public Utilities Bureau, and the City Council to request an explanation of whether it is legal to abandon the pricing of public utilities in national currency and to request prompt correction and prevention in order to maintain industry and benefit people's livelihood. In addition, the Shanghai Nanjing Road Business Association also issued a statement yesterday opposing the pricing of public utilities in customs gold units.</p>

<h3>British EMI Company Dismisses Workers, Causing Disputes</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The British Electrical and Musical Industries Company (i.e. EMI) dismissed all 103 employees of the company in November 1944. Later, the company resumed business and re-employed the dismissed employees. Recently, due to the poor sales of the company's records in the Nanyang area, the company was unable to maintain operations. According to the company, it has lost £10,000. It is now planning to dismiss 48 of the 67 workers and 10 of the 30 staff members to reduce expenses. The dismissed personnel will be paid three months' severance pay based on the index at the end of February. The employees requested that three months' wages be paid based on the cost of living index on March 15. The company believed that the amount was too large and did not agree to the request, causing a dispute. The matter is currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau will review the company's books and records. If it is indeed losing money, it will allow the dismissal. If the income and expenses can be offset, the dismissal will not be allowed to avoid increasing social unrest.</p>

<h3>Zhang Ziping Sued as a Traitor, Retrial Still Upholds the Original Judgment, Living in Poverty and Family Discord, Double Stimulation, Infinite Pain, Female Relatives Attending the Court to Hear the Judgment Talk About Zhang's Recent Situation</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Zhang Ziping, a writer who became famous for writing triangular love novels, was sued for treason. After being sent back to the High Court for retrial, the judgment was pronounced at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, sentencing him to one year and three months of imprisonment, depriving him of public rights for two years, and confiscating his property except for the necessary living expenses for his family. Zhang did not attend the court yesterday. A female relative of his attended the court to hear the judgment. After leaving the court, the female relative talked to reporters about Zhang's recent situation, but she was unwilling to reveal her relationship with Zhang. She said that Zhang's current life is extremely difficult and poor. Due to the impact of this case, he has not published any works for a long time and only relies on submitting articles to a small newspaper in the city for a living. In addition, he translates some textile articles for the Damao Textile Company to help subsidize his living expenses. Due to the meager income, it has affected the harmony between families, and there are quarrels day and night, with almost no peace. His wife and daughters especially showed disapproval of Zhang from time to time, and it can be imagined from the fact that he was not allowed to use the phone at home. In addition to being punished, Zhang was also coldly treated by his wife and daughters, and the double stimulation caused Zhang infinite pain. Zhang originally hoped that the judgment yesterday would declare him not guilty so that he could resume his writing career, but the result was still to uphold the original judgment, which was unexpected. The female relative said: Zhang may consider appealing to the Supreme Court again. Drawing by Lu Shaofei</p>
<h3>The City Industrial Association Calls for Three Points Regarding the New Financial and Economic Reform Plan, Plans to Request the Cancellation of the Collection of Goods Tax in Kind, etc.</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The City Industrial Association recently telegraphed the Executive Yuan, etc., planning to request the cancellation of the method of collecting goods tax in kind and to maintain the method of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Imports are divided into prohibited imports, temporarily suspended imports, and increased limited imports. The original telegram roughly stated:</p>
<p>The announcement of the financial and economic reform plan on February 25 caused all production enterprises to frown and lose color. The most serious relations are the collection of goods tax in kind, the cancellation of the foreign exchange transfer certificate chain, and the freedom of import. The cotton spinning, wool spinning, cigarette, cement, and match industries are all subject to factory tax collection, and the burden is heavy. Sales have already decreased significantly, and with high interest rates and huge expenses, it is already difficult to continue. Now, while stopping the collection of land tax in kind, we are collecting goods tax in kind from factories. Is this not persecuting industrial production? Furthermore, the total exports in 1938 were only US$240 million. In addition to the income from overseas Chinese remittances, the amount is also limited, while the foreign exchange required for equipment and raw materials is huge, and most of the quotas for the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth quarters have not yet been settled. Now, if we suddenly open up free imports, the foreign exchange transfer certificates will be profitable, and speculators and national banks will absorb them in large quantities. With only a small amount of foreign exchange transfer certificates, they will become rare commodities that can be hoarded, and the prices will rise. Our industry needs equipment and raw materials, so we must buy foreign exchange transfer certificates at high prices, which increases the burden. Therefore, our industry is the victim again, so we must request that the chain system be maintained. Furthermore, the fragility of our country's industry is undeniable. Although various industries have laid a foundation, if they are protected and supported, they may not be able to flourish. If they encounter a storm again, they can be destroyed without anything left. The financial and economic reform plan only stipulates the import of permitted and prohibited goods, and there are no restrictions on those that can be produced domestically but whose output is insufficient, such as industrial raw materials such as acids and alkalis and electrical equipment such as motors. In recent years, there has been great progress, but with the rise in wages and raw materials, the cost has not been reduced and cannot compete with foreign goods. Recently, due to war obstacles, various manufactured products cannot be sold smoothly, and inventory is high and turnover is difficult. All of these have been overwhelming. If such goods are freely imported without any restrictions, then the situation in the thirty-fourth and fifth years when foreign goods poured in like a tsunami will be repeated, which is equivalent to immediately suffocating the dying industry. In view of the above, matters related to the national foundation and people's livelihood must be urgently appealed, and attention should be paid to supplementing the implementation regulations of the new plan as soon as possible. The opinions are presented as follows: (1) Cancel the collection of goods tax in kind. (2) Maintain the foreign exchange transfer certificate chain system. (3) Luxurious goods and those that are already fully produced domestically should be completely listed as prohibited imports. Those that are produced domestically but are temporarily insufficient should be listed as temporarily suspended imports, and please increase the number of limited imports, and revise them at any time according to domestic production and needs. If it is considered unnecessary, add tariffs. The above three points are related to the continuation of domestic production, and it is reasonable to request an assessment and prompt adoption.</p>
<p>[Also reported] The National Cement Federation also telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, making a painful appeal on the issue of the collection of goods tax, believing that it must not be implemented and hoping to maintain the original tax collection method. In addition, they also telegraphed various authorities, requesting that cement be included in the list of prohibited imported goods in order to maintain domestic production.</p>

<h3>The Central Trust Bureau's Deputy Sells Assets of the Enemy Assets Committee; Trial Opens in Case of Employee Embezzling and Selling Ginseng; Bureau Asks for Inclusion of Luo Zhiqin of Yongda Ginseng Shop as a Witness; Ling Fengsheng and Others Deny Involvement, Request Bail Denied</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Ling Fengsheng, an employee of the Central Trust Bureau acting on behalf of the Enemy Assets Committee and head of the warehouse, along with Yang Zhaoxiang, a manager, Zhang Minyuan, an employee, and Li Yongqing, a worker, colluded with broker Zheng Heqing to substitute inferior red ginseng for high-quality Korean ginseng. Judge Meng Tingke of the District Court opened the initial trial yesterday afternoon. Hao Zhaomi, representing the Central Trust Bureau, appeared in court as a witness, retaining lawyer Shen Yushan for civil proceedings, and requested that Luo Zhiqin, the person in charge of Yongda Ginseng Shop who purchased the stolen goods, be listed as a defendant. According to the plaintiff's side, the defendants stole a total of 391 boxes of Korean ginseng from the warehouse, each containing 28 branches, valued at one tael of gold per box. After the incident, 380 boxes were recovered, but each box was missing two or three branches, totaling 53 missing branches. The family of Ling offered to compensate for the remaining 11 unrecovered boxes, but after expert inspection, the ginseng was deemed of very poor quality, worth only one-third of the original ginseng, and requested compensation. After the incident, the police investigation revealed that the defendants and their accomplices at large had discussed the plan in room 307 of the Guandong Asia Hotel. The plan was to replace the stored ginseng, with a total value of 300 taels of gold, with inferior ginseng estimated at 50 taels, and after deducting a 10 tael commission, they could net 240 taels. Defendant Ling Fengsheng stated that he was in charge of the warehouse, but the office was located in the Central Trust Bureau on Guangdong Road, and all warehouse matters were entrusted to Yang Zhaoxiang and Zhang Minyuan. The warehouse keys were held by Yang and Zhang during the day and handed over to him after work. He did not know who transported the ginseng out. Regarding the meeting in the Guandong Asia Hotel room to discuss the ginseng swapping plan, he claimed to have strongly opposed it. When questioned, defendants Yang and Zhang stated that Ling was responsible for holding the warehouse keys. Although they went to Guandong Asia Hotel that day, they saw Ling already there and rejected the ginseng swapping method before leaving. The other two defendants also denied any involvement. After repeated questioning by the court, the judge ordered a special trial to be scheduled at a later date, and the defendants' request for bail was denied.</p>

<h3>Youth Army 202nd Division Requests Thorough Investigation of Forced Purchase Incident</h3>
<p>Wang Dajun, commander of the Youth Army 202nd Division of the Army, stated: "I recently read a news item in your newspaper on March 3 of this year, strictly prohibiting soldiers from forced purchases, which mentioned that the Shanghai Municipal Council had received complaints from twelve coal shops that soldiers claiming to be from the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in this city were forcing them to purchase fuel. I was very surprised after reading this. After investigating, this incident occurred before January 10 of this year. In fact, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters ordered our division to investigate. Since our division was stationed in the Suzhou and Changshu area and did not have any troops stationed in Shanghai, the alleged daily forced purchases from various shops were clearly not true, or were impersonated by other troops, deliberately undermining the reputation of our division. Furthermore, our division has been stationed in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and other places for more than two years, and there has never been a forced purchase incident. This further proves that it has already been reported and thoroughly investigated.

Staff remaining in Shanghai are scheduled to receive their salaries at the Senior Mechanical Vocational School at 1195 Fuxing Middle Road on the afternoon of the 8th. This remittance from Guangzhou was made before the Executive Yuan discussed adjustments, so it will be temporarily distributed at 75 times the base salary. It is also reported that Acting Minister Chen has telegraphed Guangzhou, hoping to remit an additional 150 times the base salary, which will be supplemented after the March cost of living index is released. In addition, 30 staff members in Shanghai who had not yet registered for the 15,000 yuan per person issued by the Ministry of Education last month have not yet received it because the list was reported to the Ministry later.

<h3>Arsonist in Fuyou Road Fire Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Ding Qiaozhang, the owner of Datong Garment Shop at the intersection of Fuyou Road and Anren Street in the city, set a fire in anger on the morning of the 5th because he resented the second landlord, the owner of Futai Tobacco and Paper Shop, for forcing him to move out. As a result, the owner of Futai Shop was burned to death on the spot, and six houses were destroyed. After the incident, Ding fled without a trace. Afterwards, someone reported to the Yimiao Police Station that Ding was suspected of arson. Chief Qi of the Qifen Bureau ordered Zhou Nantong, the head of the Criminal Division, to issue an arrest warrant.

<h3>Old Case of Suspected Gold and Currency Trading; Cracked Last Summer, Indictment Only Now</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai office of Deyuan Salt Shop, formerly the Tongyi Bank, with Shen Boya as the person in charge, ostensibly ceased operations of Tongyi during the authorities' ban on black market gold and currency trading, and ostensibly leased the premises to Deyuan as an office. In reality, this was a cover for continuing black market trading. The police discovered this, and on June 14 of last year, officers were dispatched to investigate. They found multiple checks totaling 8.93978 billion yuan, two gold bars, and over 20 yuan in foreign currency on Shen Shanqi, an accountant at the shop, Qiu Zizhang, an employee of the Nanjing headquarters, Shen's friend Yan Yongxiang, neighbor Qin Wenyuan, and Fan Zizhong, who was visiting a friend at the shop. The police believed that the defendants were suspected of black market trading in gold and foreign currency and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Yesterday, a public prosecution was filed for disrupting financial order.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The handover ceremony between the old and new directors of the Shanghai Police Bureau was held yesterday morning on the bureau's plaza. Over 200 senior police bureau officials participated. The new director, Mao Sen, arrived at 9:30 AM and rested briefly in the director's office before being accompanied by Director Yu into the plaza amidst military music.

After the seal was handed over, Director Yu delivered a speech, stating that he had come to Shanghai to assist Director Xuan in overseeing police affairs and had served for three and a half years. During this time, he had repeatedly requested to resign, but his requests were not approved. The security authorities believe that Shanghai's position is becoming increasingly important. In order to strengthen military-civilian ties, the appointment of General Mao Sen to head the bureau was announced, which he found extremely satisfactory. He hoped that all colleagues would continue to work hard under Director Mao's leadership, remaining true to their original intentions. Min then delivered a speech, offering much encouragement. Finally, Director Mao delivered a speech, stating that Shanghai's police affairs have been well planned and laid by Director Xuan and Director Yu, and that the foundation has been consolidated. He hoped to receive the assistance of all sectors and public opinion in the future. The ceremony concluded at around 11:00 AM. After taking office, Director Mao met with reporters and stated that he was ordered to take charge of Shanghai's police affairs, and that he was aware of his limitations. In the future, he would abide by the orders of the mayor and higher authorities, supervise his subordinates to be loyal to their duties, maintain order, and protect the people. He would not easily change the original personnel of the police bureau and hoped that his subordinates would serve with peace of mind. He also hoped that they would be self-disciplined, abide by laws and regulations, be kind to the people, fully display the spirit of service, improve service efficiency, and thoroughly eliminate those who are corrupt and incompetent. In the future, he would pay special attention to the welfare of his colleagues and promote outstanding police officers. He continued to say that Shanghai is a martial law area (with clear legal provisions), and he would uphold the intent of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to ensure harmonious relations between the military and the people. He would fully guarantee the lives and property of the six million citizens and foreigners. Finally, he sincerely hoped that the citizens of the city would provide assistance and cooperation, and he welcomed guidance from all sectors.</p>

<h3>Business Circles in Both National and Communist Controlled Areas Planning Barter Trade; Coal Supply Secured; Pork Supply to be Facilitated; Current Problem Lies in Finding a Barter Location</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Affected by the war, the product sales and raw material sources of the business community are becoming increasingly difficult, and the overall situation is precarious. An effort to rescue themselves is now brewing, aiming to promote extensive barter trade between the business communities of the National and Communist controlled areas through their own unity and efforts, so that goods can flow smoothly and each can get what they need. Qian Chengxu, manager of the National Goods Ten Factories Export Promotion Office, which is carrying out this work, has reached concrete conclusions after contacting business circles along the Nanjing-Shanghai line in recent days. Two representatives have been dispatched to northern Jiangsu to discuss the details of implementing barter trade with the business community there, and to investigate transportation routes. (According to the above situation, it was seen in this newspaper yesterday.) Qian told reporters yesterday that the sales of industrial products in southern Jiangsu are narrowing day by day. For example, in Wujin, the average monthly supply of cotton cloth to northern Jiangsu was 10,000 bolts in the past, but now it is only 800 to 900 bolts. Southern Jiangsu urgently needs cotton, coal, soybeans, pork, etc. In northern Jiangsu, there is an urgent need for sugar, hardware, cloth, and western medicine from southern Jiangsu. The business communities in both regions are eagerly hoping that barter trade will be realized as soon as possible, and the government and the Chinese Communist Party have expressed their agreement and believe that they can obtain assistance. The current problem is to find a location under variable permission as a place for the exchange of goods between the two regions. Its safety is absolutely guaranteed. The coal exchange location has been found to be Yuxikou, opposite Wuhu, and the capital can soon obtain a monthly supply of 60,000 tons of coal from that location. The original location for other goods exchange stations was Jingjiang, but it is currently difficult to decide. More details can be obtained after the representatives return to Shanghai. At that time, he will request the military authorities to provide protection. Qian said that the current source of pork in Shanghai is mostly purchased from northern Jiangsu in silver dollars, which is very expensive. In the future, sugar may be transported for exchange.</p>
<h3>Incensed the Military; Misfortune Strikes; Two Boatmen Shot and Wounded; One in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhu Xiaoer, 54, who works as a rice boatman, was carrying over ten stones of white rice last night around 8:00 PM. His boat was berthed outside the Bentang Lane Bridge on the Suzhou River. Five straw boats belonging to a certain army unit were berthed nearby, preparing to depart for another location. As they were moving from west to east, the Suzhou River was crowded with boats, and the waterways were blocked. Soldiers escorting the straw boats ordered Zhu's boat to move out of the way. Zhu ordered his assistant, Xu Liujin, 32, to jointly push the boat away. However, a cargo boat was blocking the way in front, and Zhu was unable to move the boat, which angered the soldiers on the straw boat at the rear. The soldiers crossed several boats, aimed their rifles at Zhu's boat, and fired one shot, hitting Zhu Xiaoer in the right abdomen and right finger, and also wounding assistant Xu Liujin in the left leg. Both were bleeding profusely. The neighboring boat called the fire department, which dispatched an ambulance to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the hospital notified the Water Police Bureau to send officers to investigate. However, the soldiers who fired the shots and the straw boats had already disappeared. It is reported that after Zhu and Xu were admitted to the hospital, Zhu, due to his old age and the gunshot wound to his vital abdomen, was in critical condition despite surgery by the doctor.</p>

<h3>Control Yuan Receives New Complaint Letter Regarding the Handling of Northeastern Goods Disputes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the mishandling of Northeastern goods, no results have yet been obtained after the investigation led by Control Yuan Vice President Liu Zhe. A document over a thousand words long, signed by "2,762 representatives of refugees from the Northeast in Shanghai and various groups of fellow villagers from the army, navy, air force, police, inspectors, industry, commerce, and academia," was presented to the Control Yuan, accusing of mishandling and various malpractices by the personnel involved. At the same time, three facts were listed to illustrate the funds defrauded, etc. The complaint letter has been transferred by the Control Yuan to the Supervisory Committee's Office in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang region for handling. The Supervisory Committee plans to discuss the handling of this case at the Control Yuan's annual meeting on the 12th of this month, in order to show solemnity.</p>
<h3>Xi Demao Arrives in Shanghai; Trip to the United States Uncertain</h3>
<p>Silver Loan Matter Subsides</p>
<p>[Our Report] China Bank General Manager Xi Demao arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM aboard the President Wilson from Hong Kong. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States on the 9th. Xi hurried off the ship and went to the China Bank on the Bund for rest. Xi was accompanied by senior bank officials Yu Yingjie, Lin Weiying, and Dai Zhi. According to a magnate from the bank who went to the port to welcome Xi yesterday, "I can guarantee that General Manager Xi will not go to the United States." Since the central authorities approved the restoration of silver dollar circulation in the new financial plan, news has spread from the central government that it will borrow silver from the United States to increase the amount of silver dollars minted. When Xi was in Hong Kong, he once consulted with Song Ziwen, Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, and others, and then it was reported that Xi would represent our country to the United States to negotiate a silver loan. However, the initial response from the United States seemed uninterested in the silver loan and became colder. Therefore, it is expected that Xi will have some considerations before going to the United States. According to another source, although the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) prohibits the circulation and use of silver dollars in its area after the public announcement of silver dollars, the CCP government is vigorously seeking to obtain the materials of the government area, and the government is considering appropriate countermeasures to this. In addition, the price of silver in the United States is higher than in China. If silver is lent to China, it may still flow back into the United States. The failure of this silver loan is actually related to these two issues.</p>
<p>[Our Report] According to a CCP telegram from Beiping on the 7th, the Beiping Military Control Commission is strictly cracking down on silver dollar trading and arresting such silver dollar dealers. From March 2 to 4, 116 people have been arrested by the Public Security Bureau. All silver dollars were confiscated and handed over to the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank. It is said that the Beiping Military Control Commission announced this ban on February 28. Currently, most silver dollar dealers in various silver dollar markets have automatically changed careers, but "illegal activities are being carried out secretly," and have not yet been eliminated.</p>

<h3>Land Reform in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 6th] When the former Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Chen Gongbo, first took office, he held a tea party for reporters. After emphasizing ensuring public security and increasing production, a reporter invited the provincial government official to speak, saying, "Considering the current economic situation in Zhejiang, it is not an industrial economy but an agricultural economy. The factors causing unrest today should be sought within the agricultural economy. We feel that land reform is extremely important."</p>
<p>Chen Yi was determined to implement land reform in Zhejiang Province and formally passed the land reform plan and measures in a provincial government meeting at the end of the 37th year. His</p>
<p>Main Points</p>
<p>were as follows: (1) Restrict the maximum area of land ownership. Except for the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed, and educational or charitable organizations that maintain their livelihoods through land, after appropriately retaining cultivated land, the remainder shall be distributed to tenant farmers and owner-cultivators. Within ten years, all 2,500,891 tenant farmer and semi-owner-cultivator households in the province should obtain their own cultivated land from the 20,046,461 mu of land they currently tenant. At the same time, thoroughly implement the 25% rent reduction, reasonably regulate wage labor wages, and protect tenant farmers and wage laborers who are unable to become owner-cultivators. (2) The maximum area of land ownership is 50 mu for families with five or more members and 25 mu for families with fewer than five members. Monks, Taoists, the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed are allowed to retain non-self-cultivated land at a rate of 5 mu per person. Each ancestral hall is allowed 50 mu. Excess land will be distributed to the original tenant farmers, wage laborers, military dependents, demobilized soldiers, and other farmers who need land for self-cultivation, with the township as the distribution unit. (3) Implementation schedule: In the first period, two counties will be started in the first year and completed in five years. Four counties will be started in the second year and completed in five years. Eleven counties will be started in the third year and completed in five years. Eleven counties will be started in the fourth year and completed in five years. Twelve counties will be started in the fifth year and completed in five years. A total of 840,387 owner-cultivator households should be supported, and 6,604,643 mu of cultivated land should be adjusted and distributed. In the second period, thirteen counties will be started in the sixth year and completed in five years. Thirteen counties will be started in the seventh year and completed in four years. Twelve counties will be started in the eighth year and completed in five years. A total of 1,668,531 owner-cultivator households should be supported, and 13,441,818 mu of cultivated land should be adjusted and distributed. (4) The cost for ten years is estimated at 5 shi of rice per mu, totaling 100,023,130 shi. After deliberation by the provincial government, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Pinghu, one city and two counties, were determined as the implementation counties for the first year of the first period, and implementation would begin this year.</p>
<p>After Chen resigned, Zhou Fengzhang succeeded him as the head of Zhejiang Province. In the administrative program he proposed for Zhejiang Province in the 38th year, he specifically listed one item, stating that land reform would continue to be implemented. His original words were as follows: "Implement land reform by selecting counties and cities to conduct pilot programs in a</p>
<p>gentle</p>
<p>manner that does not disturb the people, to achieve the goal of 'land to the tiller.' In counties that have not yet implemented land reform, the 25% rent reduction and restriction of land rent should still be thoroughly implemented, and tenant farmers should be actively protected and owner-cultivators supported." From this, we should know that the leaders of the Zhejiang Provincial Government have seen the knot of current social unrest in rural villages and have thus risen to take this measure.</p>
<p>Speaking of Zhejiang, the three prefectures of Hang (zhou), Jia (xing), and Hu (zhou) (i.e., Wu and Yue) are commonly known as the Western Zhejiang region, while the eight prefectures of Jin (hua), Qu (zhou), Yan (zhou), Wen (zhou), He (zhou), Chu (zhou), Ning (bo), and Shao (xing) are commonly known as the Eastern Zhejiang region. The Western Zhejiang region is located in the Taihu Lake basin and along the Qiantang River, Huangpu River, etc., and is therefore a fertile plain rich in products. The Eastern Zhejiang region is mostly mountainous, with the Siming, Kuaiji, and Kuocang Mountains being the largest, their mountain ranges spread throughout the counties of Eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Western Zhejiang</p>
<p>is closer to the sea, has more land than mountains, and has seen a greater influx of foreign culture. There is also less isolation compared to Eastern Zhejiang. Although many landlords in Western Zhejiang own more than 100 mu of land, they generally transfer the perpetual tenancy rights to tenant farmers. With perpetual tenancy rights, the tenant farmers can manage the land well. This has led to the formation of many large tenant farmers who rent land from Landlord A and Landlord B and then sublet it to small tenant farmers. These large tenant farmers are better off than the small tenant farmers, and even better off than the landlords. In the past, China's land system fostered landlords who did not work and yet profited. Since the times have been progressing, it has gradually become difficult for landlords to live off their land. I once conducted an investigation in the Suzhou and Jiaxing areas, which were once paradises for the landlord class, but are now very declining. After the implementation of the 25% rent reduction, landlords in the plains have been greatly threatened, increasing their burdens and troubles. Therefore, landlords in the plains are trending towards decline. What has risen in their place is the large tenant farmer, who exists in the cracks and can exploit both sides.</p>
<p>The situation in</p>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>is completely opposite. Because the area is mostly mountainous, the influx of foreign culture has been slower. There are fewer large landlords than in Western Zhejiang, and there are no perpetual tenancy rights. Because there are no perpetual tenancy rights, tenant farmers who rent land must be filial to the landlords, otherwise, they will not be able to rent the land next year. At the same time, the landlords determine the price of land rent. Although the landlords own very little land, they have the power to lend it out, so everything is better for them than for the landlords in Western Zhejiang. Zhejiang Province was the first to implement the 25% rent reduction, and the results have been the most remarkable. However, many counties in Eastern Zhejiang have not yet widely implemented it, which has led to the formation of a more superior position for landlords.</p>
<p>From these two comparisons, we can know that the land situation in Eastern Zhejiang is more serious than in Western Zhejiang. Reflected in the current situation, the unrest in Eastern Zhejiang is much more significant than in Western Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Currently, the land reform being implemented in Zhejiang Province has selected Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Pinghu, two counties and one city with fewer problems, as the first-period</p>
<p>pilot</p>
<p>counties. We believe that the implementation of land reform must be aimed at the areas with the most current problems and implemented thoroughly to eliminate problems and stabilize the region. Some people say that Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Pinghu have completed surveying, while many other counties have not. However, we should quickly conduct surveying while actively implementing land reform to avoid the problems in areas with many problems from becoming more numerous, making it almost impossible to start implementation in the future. We are not opposed to conducting land reform in Western Zhejiang first, but land reform in Western Zhejiang must rationally distribute the land of landlords while reducing the exploitation by large tenant farmers. At the same time, seeing the urgency of the situation in Eastern Zhejiang and the complexity of the problems, it seems necessary to avoid the easy and choose the difficult, and prescribe the right medicine for the disease.</p>
<p>In the main points of the Zhejiang Province land reform method, there is a point that monks, Taoists, the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed are allowed to retain non-self-cultivated land at a rate of 5 mu per person, which we also need to discuss. Because</p>
<p>monks and Taoists</p>
<p>are recognized by the general public as a leisure class. When I visited the Shiwu Cave in the spring of the 35th year, I met a monk who spoke extensively about the principle that monks must engage in production. He said, "Monks today can no longer eat for free. They should contribute some labor to earn their living, which is the meaning of life." We cannot foster a leisure class that idles and profits without working. Therefore, if monks and Taoists retain cultivated land, they must cultivate it themselves to be reasonable. Also, the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed in the current Chinese rural areas all work diligently themselves. The reference must be to cities. Since it is in cities, we should enrich the facilities of the welfare homes with the land that the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed should receive to support more of them. Wouldn't that be better? The above can also be said to be a gentle policy.</p>
<p>Land reform has already begun in Zhejiang Province, but</p>
<p>at the beginning,</p>
<p>the vast majority of farmers must be made to understand it to avoid intermediaries from creating confusion. Therefore, it must be coordinated with education so that intellectuals and even primary and secondary school students can go deep into rural areas to explain various aspects of land reform.</p>
<p>Of course, today's rural areas in Zhejiang have also reached a state of decline. Cultivation has been abandoned, and farmhouses and farm tools are frequently dilapidated. When we carry out land reform, we must also cultivate the vitality of rural areas, improve rural life, and enrich rural education so that rural areas can be revived.</p>
<h3>Grenade Explodes in Jiading, Four Elementary School Students Injured, One Dead</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jiading, 6th] At around 4:00 PM on the 5th, students from Lianxi Elementary School picked up a rifle grenade at the Northwest City River, which suddenly exploded, injuring four and killing one. After the incident, a reporter went to investigate and learned that the garrison held live-fire exercises at the northwest corner of the city, resulting in a small number of unexploded rifle grenades being left in the area around the Northwest City River. When Lianxi Elementary School outside the West Gate was dismissed from school, a group of students returned home. Passing through the area, they saw a rifle grenade left in the Shen family's vegetable garden. One of them bent down to pick it up and look at it when suddenly there was a loud explosion, and shrapnel flew in all directions. Five people in the crowd fell to the ground, covered in blood and flesh, a tragic sight. Among them, Zhaoming, Wang Qiutao, Zhang Genrong, and Lu Qiya had their legs and feet destroyed by the explosion.

<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th] Yu Zurong, an attached member of the Nanxun Town Self-Defense Brigade in this county, went to Mudu with two female relatives in a carriage on the 2nd. After Yu and the others finished touring the mountains, they took the original carriage back to Suzhou. Unexpectedly, about eight li from Mudu, they were suddenly robbed by four robbers with guns. The four robbers were originally the ones who had taken the same car to Lingyan Temple earlier. This time, they robbed more than one tael of gold jewelry and Yu's own six-inch pistol. After the robbery, they fled to Baimajian. The coachman is suspected and has been handed over to the General Bureau. The county government ordered Wu Xi, the district chief of Zhu, to solve the case within a time limit.</p>
<h3>Qinghai "Shawa" Go to Goldfields in Early Summer</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xining, 1st (Airmail)] Qinghai counties previously issued orders regarding "Shawa" (i.e., gold diggers) going to the goldfields to dig for gold: Before the end of the third month of the lunar calendar this year, all were prohibited from going to the goldfields to work. The Qinghai Provincial Government recently issued orders to the counties because this gold mining work is very necessary for the people's livelihood, allowing these many "Shawa" to go to the goldfields to start work in early April of the lunar calendar. However, they are still not allowed to go too far, such as Xingxiu Hai and other places.</p>
<h3>Unable to Study in India, Ma Xuandao and Others Return to Qinghai</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xining, 3rd (Airmail)] Four young people, including Aheng Ma Xuandao, who were funded and sent to India for further study by the Qinghai Provincial Government, flew to Shanghai last October, intending to transfer to India. Later, due to changes in national affairs, it was not easy to complete the procedures for going abroad, so they decided to stop going abroad. Now, they have returned to Xining.</p>
<h3>Banditry Rampant in Xiuwen, Guizhou</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guiyang, 2nd (Airmail)] Xiuwen County, less than a hundred li from Guiyang, has recently had a major disturbance. Ma Huailin, a member of the Provincial Assembly of the county, and Xu Tianen, the head of the Grain Bureau, incited ignorant villagers in Xiaoqing Township, not far from the county seat, and raised the slogan "No grain tax, no conscription." Using the seven or eight guns they had as capital, they confiscated the guns of the police teams in the nearby four or five townships and now have 500 to 600 rioters and more than 100 long and short guns, posing a threat to attack the county seat. Assemblyman Ma was originally a major special agent sent by the Kuomintang to work behind enemy lines in Shandong during the War of Resistance. He can be considered a loyal person. After returning home after the victory, he was repeatedly frustrated in politics. He failed to win the election for National Assembly representative and deputy speaker of the Provincial Assembly. It is unknown why he suddenly took this action today when the Kuomintang is going through difficult times. Chairman Gu Zhenglun could not bear the local decay and is now urging local elders and female legislator Chen Mingxian in Guiyang to persuade him not to cause trouble. At the same time, he is deploying troops and generals to "prepare for war and seek peace." People familiar with the political situation in Guizhou say that this unfortunate event will not be difficult to end in the short term.</p>
<p>The root cause of instability in Guizhou is the influence of the neighboring provinces' laissez-faire policies on the planting of opium, coupled with the incitement of people with political ambitions. The villagers are ignorant and naturally restless. The newly appointed county magistrates in the province's 79 counties are mostly military personnel. If they can combine politics with military affairs, the banditry in Guizhou will still not be difficult to quell.</p>

<h3>Reader Consulting, Legal Interpretation: Question Regarding Redemption of Dianquan Rights</h3>
<p>Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi</p>
<p>Shao Shenkui asks: My friend A's father, B, pawned 1.2 mu of good farmland to C ten years ago, with a middleman as guarantor. At that time, A was young. Now A is an adult and has learned that the contract has long expired. He intends to redeem it, but his father and the middleman have all died, and there is no one to prove it. Although he has repeatedly requested C, he has been refused and falsely claimed that it has long been sold outright. It is found that the above-mentioned farmland has not yet been transferred with a tax deed. Please ask: (1) Can he sue in court without hiring a lawyer? (2) What is the difference between a pawned land deed and an outright sale land deed? (3) Is C's excuse that the redemption period has been too long a valid reason?</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) The parties to a lawsuit can file a lawsuit in court, but if they hire a lawyer to draft the complaint, handle the procedures, cite the law, and organize the facts, it will be more thorough. Non-lawyers cannot represent lawsuits, and shysters are strictly prohibited by the court. However, if the parties understand the law themselves and feel that they can handle it, then legally, it is not necessary to hire a lawyer to represent them. (2) Dianquan is a unique type of right in our country, and the Civil Code has provisions for it, which is very different from an outright sale. (3) The time limit for redemption of pawned property, etc., are all detailed in Chapter 8 of the Civil Code on Dianquan. Please purchase a law book and read it carefully to understand.</p>

<h3>Changzhou Cracks Down on Illegal Troops: A Major Case of Kidnapping for Ransom</h3>
<p>More than eighty people have redeemed themselves with rice.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wujin, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense ordered the establishment of supplementary training groups in various places to accommodate vagrant soldiers and reorganize them into training. The intention was good. After receiving the order, Changzhou established a regiment outside the West Gate in the fake Taiyu Rice Factory. Since the establishment of the regiment, more than eighty ordinary people around the West Gate have been arrested in the name of vagrant soldiers. After being taken, they were asked to name a price in rice for their release, which was the same as kidnapping for ransom. The civilians, afraid of the power of the troops, were extremely uneasy. After receiving the report, the police sub-bureau of the district, under the instruction of Deputy Commander Jiao of the pacification zone, immediately started investigating. On the 4th, they arrested Zhang Yonghong, a key criminal serving in the supplementary training group. Then, they arrested Qian Er and Shi Sibao. After being interrogated by the criminal police team, Zhang confessed that he was originally a character dismantler from Dongtai. He was introduced by a fellow villager of the chief of the supplementary training class, surnamed Li, and was able to work in the regiment. He confessed in detail that the regiment arbitrarily arrested good people in the name of supplementary training, falsely accusing them of being vagrant soldiers, in order to extort money. A total of about eighty people were released after paying rice for their release. He was used and obeyed orders, and he had also arrested more than thirty people, and more than ten of them had been released. Because the case involves the military, the police station has submitted a report to the Pacification Zone Command for instructions.</p>

<h3>Gansu Province Reform Movement</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Lanzhou, 3rd Dispatch] The provincial government reform movement recently advocated in Gansu did not just start now. In the past, all those who governed Gansu have advocated for reform and emphasized progress. Chairman Zhu Shaoliang's "Seeking progress in stability," Chairman Gu Zhenglun's "Seeking stability in progress," and now Chairman Guo Jiqiao's "Seeking progress in unity" all call for reform and progress. Chief Zhang Zhizhong once expressed great emotion about "reform" at a networking event in the cultural circles of Lanzhou. He said, "Everyone is constantly shouting 'reform,' but after so many years of reform, where is the reform? Where is the new?"</p>
<p>He then pointed out which elements were hindering the government's reform and called on the stubborn factions to be careful not to be swallowed and destroyed by the trend of the times. Now may be a</p>
<p>Better Opportunity for Reform</p>
<p>Because the current situation is the most difficult, but also the greatest. The relatively comfortable situation in the Northwest, especially in Gansu, has created a good opportunity where reform is necessary for survival. Therefore, Chairman Guo Jiqiao convened several provincial government reform seminars in late last month, attended by personnel above the section chief level from various provincial units, determined to eliminate all obstacles, improve people's lives, and seek comprehensive peace.</p>
<p>There are many reform items, covering almost all provincial government operations. The main ones are as follows:</p>
<p>Personnel Reform</p>
<p>Streamlining agencies, merging those with similar functions and businesses, implementing widespread layoffs, and encouraging talent to go to the countryside to strengthen grassroots organizations. The provincial government has plans for the employment of those laid off, and it is said that unemployment will not occur.</p>
<p>Military Service Reform</p>
<p>In the past, military service almost formed a distorted phenomenon where the poor were conscripted and the rich were exempt. In the future, the provincial government will simplify laws and procedures, lower the conscription standards, and reduce the scope of exemptions, so that the people can serve fairly. The method of conscription will adopt a combination of conscription and recruitment, employ cadres and talents, and give preferential treatment to military families.</p>
<p>Financial Reform</p>
<p>Restoring the cycle of peacetime financial aid to finance, financial development of the economy, and economic enrichment of finance. Redefining the silver tax collection, collecting silver in areas using silver, to balance the budget and stabilize the currency. In addition, restoring the minting of silver coins to save the fate of the currency system.</p>
<p>Land Policy</p>
<p>Land policy reform: to gradually equalize land ownership, impose increased value tax on those with more land, and collect urban land tax. Land reform will be implemented first in Yuzhong and Yongdeng counties.</p>
<p>Social Economy</p>
<p>Social Relief Reform: A mutual assistance plan for counties, cities, and bao has been drafted to help the poor with the wealth of the rich. Because the gap between the rich and the poor in Gansu is too large, the poor cannot be saved, and the rich cannot be at peace, so it is necessary to equalize wealth and implement social policies moderately.</p>
<p>Of the five key reform points reported above, some have been decided in provincial government meetings, and some are still under careful study for implementation methods. However, there are</p>
<p>Two Plans</p>
<p>That will be implemented ahead of time: one is the "Self-Defense Reform Plan," and the other is the "Financial and Economic Reform Plan." The latter stipulates that in addition to restoring the mint (estimated to produce 2,000 coins per day) and printing auxiliary coins, provincial public bonds and construction lottery tickets will be issued to encourage wealthy people to contribute more money to overcome the current economic crisis.</p>
<p>Regarding the future of this Gansu provincial government reform, Secretary-General Ding Yizhong of the provincial government made a statement at a press conference. He said, "The future of reform is optimistic." He analyzed the</p>
<p>Optimistic Factors</p>
<p>As follows: (1) Reform is necessary for survival; without reform, there is no solution to any situation. (2) Reform is necessary for peace. Based on various signs and sincerity from the government, we believe that peace will eventually be achieved. Because of the balance of power for peace, the government is now "preparing for war and seeking peace," while the Northwest is "advocating self-defense and peace." No matter how many twists and turns and difficulties are encountered in the process, as long as both sides can</p>
<p>Achieve National Peace</p>
<p>It is only a matter of time. Therefore, the Northwest should cooperate with the central government's decision-making in a reformative manner. At the same time, our policies and doctrines are close, so we can welcome peace.</p>
<p>After the central government issued the financial and economic reform plan, Chairman Guo also issued a written statement, pointing out that many financial and economic measures in Gansu have long been fully in line with the reform plan promulgated by the central government this time. In the future, we must continue to work harder to promote according to the original plan, and all problems will naturally be solved easily. He called on people from all walks of life to effectively publicize the various reform plans that the provincial government is about to promulgate and implement, and the people must have strong confidence, then the success of the plan implementation is naturally expected.</p>

<h3>National Bank Adopts Two Methods to Allocate Gold Bullion Needed by Gold Shops - Yesterday's Selling Price Was 228,000 Yuan Per Taels</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The National Bank started allocating gold bullion needed by the local gold shops for making jewelry yesterday. To ensure caution and establish great trust, a small committee was specially formed to be responsible for reviewing the allocated price and quantity. The committee consists of members from the Control Yuan, the Gold Management Bureau, the Central Bank, the trust departments of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, and the Financial Stabilization Committee. The bank will continue to allocate the required gold bullion to the gold shops. There are two methods of allocation:</p>
<p>(1) The National Bank will notify the Gold Shops Association before 11:00 AM, and the association will inform each gold shop to submit the quantity of gold they need to purchase before 11:00 AM to the National Bank. The bank's committee will determine the price and quantity to be sold, and then notify the gold shops to bring cash or National Bank cashier's checks to purchase before 1:00 PM; otherwise, the transaction will be canceled.</p>
<p>(2) The National Bank will notify each gold shop in advance of the price at which gold will be sold today, and the quantity will not be limited, allowing each gold shop to purchase freely.</p>
<p>The bank used the second method to sell yesterday, notifying each gold shop that the price of gold was 228,000 yuan per tael (containing 1,000 parts of gold), but no one came to negotiate the purchase. In addition to the above two methods, if the bank believes that it does not intend to sell or allocate on a certain day, it will not notify the gold shops, stating that there will be no supply of goods on that day.</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver Open Market May Be Established Within the Week</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Liu Gongyun, President of the Central Bank, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after completing his official duties in Beijing. Liu immediately went to the National Bank to work as usual. All sectors have high hopes for Liu's trip and are particularly concerned about the progress of Liu's instructions in Beijing. According to the bank's spokesperson, who answered reporters yesterday, the gold and silver open market is currently being actively prepared and may be established within this week. The National Bank has decided to strengthen its efforts and take active measures to stabilize rising prices, which will be effective in the shortest possible time. As for the implementation details of the financial part of the new financial plan, some have already been implemented. Other plans, such as the establishment of a financial open market, will also be announced and implemented one after another in the coming days. As for the issuance of gold yuan notes with a face value of 1,000 yuan, the National Bank has long been approved to announce the issuance. Regarding the rumor that a large number of gold yuan notes from North China have flowed into Shanghai, the spokesperson explained that the total amount of gold yuan notes in North China is limited, and sporadic infiltration is inevitable. However, due to transportation restrictions and inspections, large-scale inflows into Shanghai seem impossible.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding the issue of establishing a gold and silver open market in this city, it has gradually become concrete since the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank jointly began preparations. Liu Gongyun, President of the National Bank, had a long discussion with Finance Minister Xu Kan when he went to Beijing the day before yesterday, and the procedures and methods have been decided. After Liu returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, he also summoned the heads of the Gold Industry Association and the Gold Shops Association to discuss various technical issues related to the establishment of the market. According to sources, if there are no unexpected obstacles, the new gold and silver market is expected to be established within this week.</p>
<h3>Thousand-Yuan Notes Have Not Yet Appeared - Will Be Issued Discretionally Based on Actual Needs</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It was rumored in the market yesterday that the new 1,000-yuan notes recently announced by the Central Bank have already appeared. A reporter inquired with a confidential staff member of the bank, who said that the new 1,000-yuan notes have not yet been issued. They will be issued discretionally based on actual needs in the future.</p>
<p>[United Credit Investigation Agency News] Gold yuan notes with a face value of 1,000 yuan have not yet officially appeared this morning. According to the Issuing Bureau of the National Bank, these large banknotes will be officially issued within one or two days. As for the current shortage of banknotes, the main reason is still the disconnect between rising prices and issuance. It is expected that the current banknote panic can be improved after the new banknotes are launched.</p>
<p>Yesterday (7th), the Central Bank still limited the withdrawal of banknotes from each branch to 30%. According to the person in charge of the bank, the bank is actively working on a solution, and the banknote shortage will be relieved soon.</p>
<h3>Bank Bureaus Continue to Dispatch</h3>
<p>[Our Report] National bank bureaus continued to dispatch 68.784 million yuan yesterday, foreign firms dispatched 73.572 million yuan, large exchange banks dispatched 114.228 million yuan, and small exchange banks dispatched 119.016 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Again - Flour, Grain, and Cooking Oil Also See Price Increases</h3>
<p>Rice market prices rise without end, with high production prices. In particular, the prices in the Nangang production area are not in line with the Shanghai market, so very little arrives. The opening price this morning jumped sharply by 3-4,000 yuan, but the market was sluggish due to the flat prices outside the circle, and buyers hesitated, so the price returned slightly. In the Southern market, white japonica rice was 25,500 yuan, a sharp increase of 3,300 yuan, and early thin rice increased by 2,5600 yuan. In the Northern market, white japonica rice also opened at 25,500 yuan, an increase of 1,200 yuan, thin rice increased by 1,800 yuan, and special japonica rice reached 27,000 yuan. A total of 7,677 shi of goods arrived in the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Slightly increased, due to rumors that the Central Bank would sell materials and gold notes, and merchants were wary of high prices and eager to sell. The market was low at the beginning, but after the close, the price of gold notes rose sharply and then fell back slightly, and the market rebounded again. Old trucks opened at 10,900 yuan, fell slightly by 200 yuan at the close, and rebounded by 100 yuan after the close with strong purchases from retail investors. Warships traded at 10,330 yuan, and rebounded to 10,450 yuan in the aftermarket. Bran rose slightly by 400 yuan, and large packages traded at 8,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>The market continued to rise. Soybeans were firm at first and then fell back. Hankou car beans initially rose by 150 yuan, but then it was heard that the oil cake market was sluggish and factory demand weakened, and the market returned to its original level. Green beans have not been seen opening, and the asking price is about 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts rose by 300 yuan, corn tended to go downstream, red sorghum did not rise much, and sesame and mung beans sold well and rose by 10%.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The price was very sluggish at the opening, because it had risen too much last week, and merchants sold at high prices. Vegetable oil opened at 87,000 yuan, and then buyers took advantage of the low price, and the price rose to 94,000 yuan. At the close, the vegetable oil was 92,000 yuan and the soybean oil was 96,000 yuan, each rising by 2,000 yuan. Jittetsu brand vegetable oil was 113,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 3,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose by 500 yuan. Changzi brand cake once reached 10,000 yuan, and closed at 9,600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Turn Weak Across the Board - Taiwan Sugar One Tooth Fell to the Limit</h3>
<p>The trend of Chinese stocks turned weak across the board. The opening prices of each stock were weak due to the rumors that the Central Bank would sell gold, silver, and stocks in large quantities. Although it was once pulled up by major securities dealers in the middle, the market fell sharply again due to the still-tight monetary policy. Yongsha opened at 5 yuan and fluctuated all the way down after the opening, once falling to a low of 4.77 yuan around 11 o'clock. At 11:30, overnight major bulls tried their best to pull up the market, and the market rose all the way up, once reaching a high of 5.2 yuan. Selling at high prices, retail investors followed, and the market fell all the way down, falling directly into the 5 yuan mark, closing at 4.82 yuan. Mayer also trended downward, opening at 1.9 yuan. Zheng Zhong'an raised the board, with a high of 1.96 yuan. The bulls took profits, and retail investors went short, and the market fell to 1.77 yuan at the close. Taiwan Sugar continued to be sluggish, opening at 31,000 yuan, and once fell to the limit in the middle. Near the close, the market was slightly pulled up to 28,000 yuan due to the entry of bank gangs.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks See Both Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks saw both gains and losses. The money supply in the circle was still tight, and the overnight interest rate was 7 cents. Major dealers were not eager to buy, and retail investors were mostly on the sidelines. However, foreign firms were slightly more willing to buy. Yisha traded at 9,000 yuan and 9,200 yuan, slightly rebounding by about 100 yuan compared to the previous weekend. British Union also saw a slight increase, trading at 940 yuan and 970 yuan. Yeguang rose by 400 yuan compared to the previous Saturday, trading at 2,800 yuan and 3,000 yuan. Jardine Matheson still stood firm, trading at a high of 27,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan, an increase of more than 1,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Are Flourishing - Cotton Cloth Fluctuates at Low Levels</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flourishing. There is strong demand from South China. Local fabricators are particularly fond of fine yarn. Sentiment remains firm, and yarn prices have reached new highs. The price of 42s Blue Phoenix yarn fluctuated greatly. Initially, it was 1.55 million yuan, and then it jumped sharply to a high of 1.81 million yuan. Later, as there were many floating profits and sales, the price fell to 1.7 million yuan at the end, up 160,000 yuan from Saturday. 40s Jincheng also rose by 130,000 yuan. 32s Yinyue fluctuated from 1.14 million yuan to a maximum of 1.23 million yuan, and finally closed at 1.2 million yuan, up 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of 21s Shuangma spot goods initially opened at 860,000 yuan, and after reaching a high of 960,000 yuan, it was loosened, and finally closed at 890,000 yuan, down 10,000 yuan alone.</p>
<p>20s Shuangma rose slightly by 40,000 yuan, and other grades such as Tiannv and Jincheng also followed up by around 30,000 yuan. 16s Guangming broke through the 800,000 yuan mark, and finally traded at 830,000 yuan. Except for the Boys' Army, which fell by 10,000 yuan, all 10s yarns showed good results.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market saw rising clearings and falling prices. In the early morning, it was reported that the National Bank would continue to sell large amounts of gold, silver, and materials to contract currency and tighten the money supply, and that the details of the new plan had been drafted and would be submitted to the next administrative meeting for discussion before being announced. As a result, holders were cautious, and most in the street adopted a wait-and-see attitude. After the opening, there was a strong bearish sentiment, and selling pressure was seen surging. Near the close, there were some purchases from Guangdong, and the market improved slightly.</p>
<p>The opening price of Longtou fine cloth was 34,600 yuan, and the opening price of Four Gentlemen yuan cloth was 33,600 yuan. Both fell into a weak position in the middle, and the closing prices were 33,800 yuan and 33,000 yuan, respectively, an increase of 2,500 yuan compared to the previous Saturday's midday close, but a decrease of about 2,000 yuan compared to the off-market asking price the next day. The trend turned upward in the afternoon, and the asking price was generally higher than the midday closing price, plus one day's interest.</p>
<h3>China Textile Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Report] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn yesterday as usual, a total of 6 types, sold 151 pieces, and 76 households were approved to purchase. The selling prices of each count of yarn were: 6s Deputy Sunlight 360,000 yuan, 8s Sunlight 430,000 yuan, 32s Yanghe 1.12 million yuan, 40s Red Race Light 1.56 million yuan, 32s Double Strand Happy Crane 1.45 million yuan, and 42s Double Strand Luma 1.62 million yuan.</p>
<h3>China Textile Company Reduces Yarn Spindles</h3>
<p>According to the authorities of China Textile Construction Company, the number of yarn spindles in all textile factories of the company has been reduced by about one-third since the transfer of the two places of Northeast and Tianjin. The yarn spindles of the Textile Construction Company in the Northeast were about 170,000 to 200,000, and the yarn spindles in Tianjin were about 300,000, so a total of 500,000 yarn spindles in these two places were taken over by the Chinese Communist Party. Recently, due to the lack of cotton sources, only about 70% of the 600,000 yarn spindles were opened, and the production of the 300,000 yarn spindles in the Qingdao China Textile Factory has also been greatly reduced due to the shortage of raw materials.</p>
<h3>The 29th Meeting of the Discount and Loan Committee Decided to Continue Handling Industrial Loans in the Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>The National Bank Discount and Loan Committee held its 29th meeting at 4:00 PM on the 7th, chaired by President Liu Gongyun, and approved the entry of public utility transportation loans. In addition, industrial loans in the Shanghai area have also been decided to continue handling.</p>
<h3>Industry Advocates Canceling Quotas for Industrial Raw Materials</h3>
<p>After Processing Imported Raw Materials, Exported Finished Products Should Be Exempt from Import Tax</p>
<p>After the financial and economic reform plan was announced, the import quotas and controls were greatly relaxed. However, the industrial raw materials industry in this city believes that this control is too strict. They advocate canceling the quotas for industrial raw materials and allowing industrial raw materials to be imported freely. Because there are few industrial raw materials that can be self-sufficient domestically at present. And there are some that cannot be manufactured domestically, but there are many users. In the past, the imports were not enough to be allocated, and in order to develop the domestic industry, it is necessary to cancel the quotas for industrial raw materials.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Foreign Sales Promotion Committee of the Municipal Industrial Association held its first group meeting at the China Textile Construction Company on the afternoon of the 7th. Wu Weijing, Ouyang Lun, Fu Liangjun, Chen Taoxin, and others attended the meeting. After discussion, it was resolved that for all imported raw materials (limited to raw materials that are insufficient in domestic production or have no production at all) that are processed into finished products for export, the import tariffs should be requested to be fully exempted.</p>
<h3>Coal Shortage Gradually Resolved</h3>
<p>The severe coal shortage in Shanghai has been gradually resolved as the transportation of goods in North China has resumed. Last month, a total of 80,274 tons of coal were transported to this city. Among them, 12,100 tons were transported from Kailuan, 15,760 tons of Soviet coal, and 2,714 tons of Taiwanese coal. This month, the amount of coal will be mainly from North China, and it is estimated that more than 50,000 tons can be transported from Kailuan alone, 40,000 tons of Taiwanese coal, more than 10,000 tons of Indian coal, and 20,000 tons of Soviet coal, and there will be other parts of 10,000 tons, for a total of 140,000 tons. After the coal is transported to Shanghai, it will be quickly allocated according to actual needs. Shanghai needs 10 dang tons, and Nanjing needs 3 dang tons.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Initially Firm, Then Fell Back</h3>
<p>The rising trend of tung oil yesterday became more and more intense. The reason was that the price of non-industrial items was rising sharply, there was a surplus of funds in the industry, and merchants unanimously asked for prices. The process moved forward. By the afternoon, top-grade white oil and genuine Pi Xihong were priced at 78,000 yuan, and secondary-brand Xihong and Qing oil were also 8,000 to 10,000 yuan higher than the previous week. However, by the evening close, as the money supply tightened and various commodities leveled off, they also followed steadily. The future can be expected to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Export and Import Management Committee Promotes Sino-Egyptian Trade</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to promote Sino-Egyptian trade, the Export and Import Management Committee, after consulting with the Egyptian government, has specially allowed importers in that country to purchase native products from our country, such as tea, sesame, textiles, pepper, tobacco, and other goods, in pounds. And in order to promote this trade, the names and addresses of the merchants who are engaged in the export of the above items will be sent to the Embassy of Egypt in China for transfer to the importers in that country, and the embassy will also be requested to send the names and addresses of the importers in that country to the committee for transfer to the exporters in our country. It is learned that the committee has received the list from the embassy and has copied it to the import and export associations and the relevant importers. Any merchants who have not received a notice from the committee and intend to engage in this trade can directly inquire with the committee for details.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>The tea market yesterday was firm and bullish in the morning, and the process was raised. Then, as the money supply loosened, the buying interest increased again, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, making the market even more exciting. Prices were uniformly high, but by the time of the attack, it was suddenly heard that the authorities were selling a large amount of materials, the funds tightened, and the rising trend began to subside. Compared with the previous week, there was a sharp increase. According to the full-day transaction, due to the scarcity of goods, the market was still struggling to rise.</p>

<h3>Gold Bonds Closed at the Limit Down Yesterday</h3>
<p>The market price of short-term gold bonds rose slightly and then fell. The morning price was 169,000 yuan, then 160,000 yuan, and then down to 152,000 yuan. Near noon, it rose sharply to 163,000 yuan, and the midday closing price was 155,000 yuan, down 13,000 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. A total of 183 taels were traded in the morning.</p>
<p>The opening price in the afternoon was 156,000 yuan, then 157,000 yuan, which was the highest price in the afternoon.

A total of 15 taels were traded in half a day.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll: Observer's Stand</h3>
<p>Relying only on two weapons, falsely aiming for two birds with one arrow, conquering the heart is better than conquering the city, the peep show hasn't been dismantled yet.</p>
<p>After a significant rise on Saturday afternoon, everyone believed that the speculative market would be pressured by the authorities when it opened on Monday, and the commodity market would also be affected. Sure enough, that was the case yesterday.</p>
<p>So, the authorities really have the power to sell, really have the power to control the market. Perhaps, but more likely not. Because the rise on Saturday evening was stimulated by rumors of the crossing of the river, and since the rumors have been proven false, the rising momentum naturally disappeared like melting ice.</p>
<p>Speaking of the authorities' power to sell, perhaps it has, but it's not worth taking seriously. Honestly speaking: only selling without buying can suppress prices in the long run, and this is something no country can do. Knowing that the effect of selling is only to temporarily suppress the fire, and in preparation for future selling, they have to take advantage of low prices to buy back. At this time and place, it is easy to sell real goods, but difficult to buy real goods. Selling without buying back, and the fire reigniting is expected, then selling seriously would be too foolish.</p>
<p>Since selling seriously is not worthwhile, but besides selling, there is really nothing else to do but stand by and watch. But standing by and watching is simply not acceptable. Without a solution, they have to come up with one, and that is the authorities' currently popular technique of virtual selling.</p>
<p>What is virtual selling? We have already briefly analyzed it in the past. That is, announcing the sale of gold, banknotes, gauze, and sugar, but actually only announcing the sale of gold and banknotes, while actually selling foreign exchange transfer certificates. Selling gauze and sugar is not entirely nonsense, but there is more thunder than rain. The entire force of suppressing the market is placed on foreign exchange transfer certificates.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange transfer certificates, like gold yuan coupons, are just paper, and the printing is not even as good as gold yuan coupons, but the paper is full of inscrutable writing, mentioning foreign exchange. Those blinded by money, upon hearing the words "foreign exchange," immediately feel secure and trust them. This kind of psychology, though somewhat excusable, is ultimately chilling. Therefore, the authorities also use poison to fight poison. Whenever they deem it necessary to take action to suppress the market, they relentlessly dump large quantities of foreign exchange transfer certificates, regardless of whether there are people in the market who want them. The fewer people who need them, the more aggressively the authorities dump them at lower prices. Whether there is a transaction or not, it is even better if there is no transaction. The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates can be lowered quickly, which then brings down the price of real gold and silver dollars, and can also threaten securities, gauze, and general prices.</p>
<p>Although this kind of virtual selling is mostly traded, who can know the truth? Because everyone does not understand the truth, the plan of virtual selling is successful. Those with funds also believe that credit is tight and raise interest rates excessively. If A raises interest rates like this, B will naturally raise interest rates as well. Thus, even though funds are loose, black market interest rates remain high. With high interest rates, hoarding goods is not necessarily more profitable than lending. With the emergence of this psychology, the virtual selling policy is fully effective.</p>
<p>The speculative market is like a battlefield. On the battlefield, military affairs account for three parts, and politics accounts for seven parts; only then can victory be assured, because conquering the heart is more powerful than conquering the city. In the speculative market, psychological factors are even more important. Therefore, although the authorities are implementing a virtual selling policy today, it is fundamentally different from Pei Tsu-yi's past real-money intervention, but conquering the heart is effective, and virtual selling does not appear to be virtual.</p>
<p>But the peep show cannot be dismantled. Once the peep show is dismantled, then no matter how much you dump foreign exchange transfer certificates, everyone will be indifferent and dismiss it with a laugh. This weapon will then enter its period of rust!</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittance Income Declines Again, Only Over 10,000 US Dollars Per Week</h3>
<p>Total Income in February Decreases by Three-Fifths</p>
<p>According to the Bank of China, overseas remittance income has recently decreased sharply, with only over 10,000 US dollars being received each week. This is a significant difference compared to the past. Since the currency reform last year, overseas remittance income has gradually increased, reaching over 4 million US dollars per month by the end of December last year. The income in November last year even reached over 10 million US dollars, almost the same as the pre-war level. However, since the beginning of this year, it has been decreasing daily. The total overseas remittance income in January was over 1 million yuan, a decrease of half compared to December last year. The total income in February was only about 400,000 US dollars, a further decrease of three-fifths compared to January. It is expected to decrease sharply again this month. Although the financial and monetary reform plan stipulates that the exchange rate for overseas remittances should be calculated based on the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, the price of transfer certificates is still far from the black market price of US dollars, making it difficult to achieve results. Overseas remittance income is a major source of foreign exchange for the country. If the handling is not improved, the future of overseas remittance income is worrying.</p>
<h3>Mediocre Silk</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market was flat. Credit in the market tightened, black market interest rates suddenly rose, and with the authorities still selling goods to suppress prices, businesses feared an extreme tightening of credit and were unable to turn around. As a result, buying interest was weak and the market lacked the strength to rise.</p>
<p>No. 120 Yuanguang's new spot goods opened at 1.03 million in the morning, with next-day financing at 1.1 million. Then, as various dealers slightly pushed up prices, confidence strengthened, and the market briefly rose to 1.2 million to 1.25 million. After the high, news came that gold in outside circles had fallen, and asking prices fell again slightly. Before the close, silk hovered around 1.2 million, and finally closed at 1.23 million.</p>
<p>Due to the sharp rise in foreign exchange certificates yesterday, raw silk was aggressively bought. Superior grade opened at 1.6 million in the morning with supply. Afterwards, gold opened lower, credit in the industry tightened, and the market softened, with asking prices falling by 50,000 yuan. Due to technical buying, prices rose again, hovering around 1.62 million before the close. Finally, the market stabilized, holders held firm, and the market closed at 1.65 million yuan.</p>
<p>The silk and satin market was still strong yesterday, with firm trading. Initially, prices were supported by rising raw material costs. Subsequently, gold prices fell back and credit tightened suddenly, with many selling off, and trading softened slightly. However, rising yarn and cloth prices from outside the industry continued to support the market. The American Asia face cloth opened at 780,000 in the morning. Supporters raised prices and pushed the market higher, once rising to 790,000 and even 800,000. After the high, as credit tightened and black market lending rates rose to 80 yuan, speculators became deeply cautious, and many retailers sold off, and the market turned soft, falling to 770,000 yuan. Afterwards, it hovered at the low end. By the time of the noon close, cotton yarn and cotton cloth prices rose, and buying interest in the market increased slightly. However, due to distribution issues, firms hedged their positions, and there was a lack of strength to push prices higher. The noon close was at 790,000.</p>

<h3>Joe Louis's Autobiography (4)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Canglong</p>
<p>After defeating Schmeling in 1938, I didn't fight again that year. I really had a good time with the money I won. Some people say that I was just wasting money, but that's not true. I organized a softball team and named it the "Brown Bombers," and I played first base. We took long-distance buses, traveled to various states in America, ate well, stayed in hotels everywhere. At the end of a softball season, I spent a total of 50,000 yuan for this. I don't think this was a waste. I had my fun!</p>
<p>I also helped a lot of unlucky old boxers. I don't think I did anything wrong. I also often donated to women's nursing homes in Detroit. The women in the nursing homes, some of whom were ninety to one hundred years old, called me "son." So, I had almost twenty mothers. When I had a lot of income, I also spent a lot of money on strange clothes for myself. This was because the clothes I wore when I was a child were ragged. At one time, I had a hundred suits, all custom-made in New York and Hollywood. After all these clothes wore out, I am no longer interested in these strange clothes. I also spent a lot of money on large cars, but now things have changed. I don't drive often now, unless I suddenly think of getting away from the crowd. Then, in the middle of the night, at two or three o'clock, I would jump into the car and drive silently for a while, until the thought of getting away from the crowd disappeared, and then I would stop the car.</p>
<p>I also supported my sister Fanice to finish high school and university. She now teaches English in Detroit and has a master's degree in history. Fanice is very smart, and I am very proud of her. Also, I bought many houses for my brothers and sisters in Detroit. I also bought an entire apartment building in Chicago with Mave, and the rent from this apartment is quite considerable.</p>
<p>But I also lost money in business. For example, I took over a coffee shop in Chicago and lost 40,000 yuan. A wine shop I ran in East Detroit also lost 25,000 yuan.</p>
<p>When the American draft came, I registered in Chicago. Some people said that I could find someone to replace me, but I didn't want to receive any special privileges. I just wanted to be an American soldier. I volunteered for military service, and they sent me to Fort Riley in Kansas. I received basic training like everyone else. I stayed there until the Department of the Army sent me on a boxing tour. But this was also the beginning of sad things for me. When I was a child in Alabama, I didn't know what racial discrimination was. But I never went to places where there was racial discrimination. In all my boxing matches, I always tried to avoid this trouble. In the army, I remained the same, because I thought I was an American, fighting for the country like other American soldiers. I also thought that if I was fighting for human freedom and equality, then I would stick to this goal to the end.</p>
<p>But once, at Camp Sibert in Alabama, I accidentally stepped into a bus station to call for a taxi. I sat down on a bench in the front row of the station, and a military policeman came over and told me that I should sit on the bench in the back row, "The back bench is reserved for people of color." Of course I didn't want to go. Robinson, a middleweight boxer who was also black, was also present and supported my opinion. The military policeman asked the supervisor to come and took us to a camp, where the army captain lectured us. He said, "When a military policeman tells you to do something, you only have to obey, otherwise, you will only be asking for trouble." I said, "Sir, I am a soldier, the same as any other American soldier. I don't want to be pushed to the back row because I am black."</p>
<p>The case was later transferred to the Inspector General of the Army in Washington. As a result, an order was issued to abolish the original seating discrimination regulations on public buses in the military. But outside the military, I still obeyed the original US regulations on racial discrimination. But in the military, everyone is fighting for one goal, so there is no need for that set of old rules.

<h3>Basketball League Tonight: Renyu Faces Haiqing for the First Time, Women's Division A-1: Green Team and Hualian Rank First</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Tonight's basketball league features three Division A games. The main match in Division A-1 is Renyu vs. Haiqing. The two teams are meeting for the first time. In the first round, Haiqing requested a postponement due to an event, and the makeup game has not yet been scheduled. Renyu's youth team has been performing very well recently, making rapid progress, and is considered by many to be one of the most promising teams besides Hualian. Haiqing is represented by a member of the recently arrived US Navy ship Springfield basketball team and has considerable strength, including three black players who are quite formidable. Renyu must work together to win, which will be another exciting game. Tickets for the City Stadium are as usual, with the schedule as follows:</p>
<p>Police Machinery - Wuming (Division A-2B) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Red Riders - Pushui (Division A-2D) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Renyu - Haiqing (Division A-1) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Since the start of the basketball league, the women's teams in Division A-1 have entered the second round. In the standings, the Green Team has won all five games, remaining undefeated and taking the top spot. The Li Team is closely following with four wins in five games. The championship will likely be contested by these two teams. The Green Team has a stronger chance. Although Hualian was unfortunately defeated by Peifeier by one point the other day, their seven wins in eight games are not enough to affect their first-place position. Second place is Renyu with five wins and two losses, only slightly behind Hualian. Shanghai Police and Huili are tied with five wins and three losses each. The remaining four Western teams are all lagging behind. The recent standings of the two groups are listed below:</p>

<h3>Democratic Cup Losers' Bracket: Pan Team to Play Public Transportation Today</h3>
<p>The Pan Team will play Public Transportation at 4:00 PM today at the Nanshi Stadium in the Democratic Cup Intermediate Group Losers' Bracket. The referee is Yue Renxiao, and the linesmen are Yan Yougeng and Zang Wenbin. The winning team will play Gonghexian this Friday (11th) at 4:00 PM to compete for the losers' bracket championship, and then play the losing team from the regular finals. Whoever wins will be the runner-up in the intermediate group and will be promoted to the senior group. However, if the losers' bracket champion has been directly defeated by the losing team in the regular finals in the regular season, it will lose the qualification to compete for the overall runner-up, and the losing team in the finals will be directly named the runner-up. This is a resolution of the conference of representatives of each European team in the competition. The organizing committee of the cup competition announced: "In order to comply with the resolution of the conference of representatives, the ticket price for both the Shanghai vs. Firefly game tomorrow and the Daxia vs. Wanli game the day after tomorrow will be 300 yuan. We hope that the responsible persons of the four teams will submit the official starting lineups for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow to the sports stadium before 5:00 PM today."</p>

<h3>British Naval Football Team to Play Longtou in Friendly Match Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The British naval ship HMS London has arrived in Shanghai. Its football team played a friendly match against the Railway team last week at the Yiyuan Stadium, drawing 1-1.

<h3>Chen Zhennan Ranks Fifth in Philippine 1500 Meter Swimming Race</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Air News] Chen Zhennan, Hong Kong's long-distance swimming champion who went to the Philippines alone, competed for the first time at the Rizal National Swimming Pool in Manila on Saturday evening (5th).</p>
<p>The event that evening was 1,500 meters. In addition to Philippine swimming experts, there were also many European and American "water monsters" participating, creating a rare and great international swimming competition in the Far East.</p>
<p>A total of nine athletes participated in the final that evening. After the gun fired, "Fat Nan" was slightly slow to enter the water. After 200 meters, Chen strove to catch up, gradually catching up, and at 250 meters, he was shoulder to shoulder with the Philippine long-distance swimming star "Mabas," only slightly behind. But before them, there were still several European and American "water monsters" and "water snakes."</p>
<p>After 29 pool lengths, everyone exerted their strength forward in the last 50 meters, vying for the lead. Chen Zhennan ranked fifth among the nine international stars. Mabash, who won the 880-yard championship in the Hong Kong-Philippine intercity swimming competition, ranked third.</p>
<p>The record for first place was 21 minutes, 35.7 seconds, which was several minutes faster than Chen Zhennan's 23 minutes, 2 seconds and 3 tenths in the Seventh National Games. However, according to Liu Dibing, who accompanied Chen in training in Hong Kong, "Chen once set an excellent record of 21 minutes, 22 seconds and 8 tenths in Hong Kong. However, this was the time made in a short 20-meter swimming pool, and it cannot be used as a standard."</p>
<p>It is understood that this Philippine International Swimming Competition is based on the World Games amateur swimming rules, and each competition records six names. Thus, "Fat Nan's" fifth place is still selected and he receives two points, so that he will not "carry an empty egg" back.</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM on the 6th, Zhennan will still participate in his second competition at the Rizal Swimming Pool. The event is 400 meters. In general, it is believed that Chen has sufficient endurance and is more confident in the 1500 meters than the 400 meters, so this item may be more difficult to win. However, before the trip, his coaches, the Huang Shaochi and Shaoxiong brothers, had already given him tips, telling him that in the 400-meter race, he must try his best to take the lead, because "Fat Nan's" stamina is formidable, but the distance is insufficient. If he can seize the lead, it will not be difficult to achieve better results.</p>
<p>During the competition, the competition was very fierce, with the distance between each person only a palm's width or half a body's difference. A large number of overseas Chinese cheered for Chen Zhennan, so although Chen competed alone in Manila, he did not feel lonely.</p>
<p>After two nights of competition in the Philippines, Chen will visit the Manila Chinese Youth Association, the Guangdong Guildhall, the Embassy, the Consulate, etc., and will be entertained by local overseas Chinese leaders. It is expected that he will return to Hong Kong on the 9th of this month by Philippine Airlines passenger plane.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Island Football News</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Air News] In Hong Kong last weekend, football matches were very lively. In the Division A competition, the overlord South China defeated the Army 4-0. Due to an incomplete lineup, China only managed a 2-2 draw with the police. In the match between Bus and Eastern, Eastern lost 4-1. South China and the Navy drew 1-1. Kitchee and Kwong Wah fought one-sidedly, with Kitchee winning by four goals. The Air Force won 3-2 against St. Joseph's.</p>
<h3>Sports World: South China Sends Army Four Eggs</h3>
<p>After South China sent the Army four eggs, according to the current situation, they still occupy the first place with a record of 13 wins, 5 draws, and 2 losses in 20 matches.</p>
<p>South China</p>
<p>Yu Yaode</p>
<p>Zhang Shuling Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Liu Songsheng Xie Jinhong Zhang Jinhai</p>
<p>Xie Jinhe Li Zhaorong Zhu Yongqiang Tian Xiebo Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>Army Team</p>
<p>Ansersen</p>
<p>Nasu Robinson</p>
<p>Linsky Kelekick Kemin</p>
<p>Bunn Massding Knott Westh Brown</p>
<p>Looking at the above lineup, although the Army failed to fight with all its strength, the two substitutes were able to work hard. On the large field, although the attacking power was not as sharp as on the small field, when they mustered their strength, they were still able to pose a considerable threat to South China. The defense was also not weak. Therefore, even a strong team like South China was only able to win by one goal in the first half. In the second half, if Nasu and Kelekick had not lost their temper and lost their rationality, and if the South China players had not been able to use the large field to disperse their concentrated strength and take advantage of it, it would have been difficult to win by so many goals.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Cup Football Final on Sunday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The semi-finals of the 3rd Mayor's Cup Football Tournament ended last week. China Airlines unexpectedly eliminated Qingbai, which had held the championship for two years, while the Railway team smoothly defeated Zhichao. China Airlines and the Railway team both qualified for the finals. The two teams are scheduled to compete for the championship at Yiyuan this Sunday afternoon at 3:00 PM. This year's Mayor's Cup has ushered in a new situation. Qingbai's monopoly has been broken. Both the Railway and China Airlines are very excited. At that time, the final battle will definitely be fought with all their strength to compete, which will be a tense situation. On the same day, Sunday morning at 10:00 AM, Yingguang and Pan Team will hold a youth cup semi-final at Yiyuan.</p>
<h3>China Almost Lost Two Points</h3>
<p>Several key players of the China team were absent, and most were replaced by players from the B team. At the beginning of the game, they had to put together a team with great difficulty, causing the game to be delayed for several minutes. The starting lineup was as follows: Yu Qi'en</p>
<p>Yu Qi'en</p>
<p>Ke Ju</p>
<p>Chen Qingquan Xu Canrong Yu Huasheng Zhang Zhanxin Guo Zhuochang</p>
<p>In contrast, the police team had added a new general, who had just transferred from Eastern, namely the "handsome guy" Yuan Yulin. With a strong lineup, fans generally believed that China would have more bad luck than good. Fortunately, the police goalkeeper "Black Boy" A Bashi played Zhuge Kongming yesterday, often displaying the empty city strategy, but "Mad Horse" Lu Huasheng did not play Sima Zhongda, getting a good opportunity to equalize, otherwise China would have lost two points without a doubt. Let's first look at the police's lineup: A Bashi</p>
<p>He Cheng Feng Beizan</p>
<p>Liu Rongguang Hou Lu Li Wei</p>
<p>Ge Lasu Yuan Yaolin Lie Min Zeng Xikang Wu Ruwei</p>
<p>Looking at the strength of the two teams, the police should be stronger than China, but in the first half, the entire police line was like scattered sand. Not only was the offensive weak, but the defense was also not as desired, allowing China to score a goal first. In the second half, the police gradually got on track and scored two goals in one breath. If "Black Boy" A Bashi had not missed the last one, allowing Huasheng to take advantage of the opportunity to score, this draw would not have been possible. It can be said that China was lucky in misfortune.</p>
<h3>Clear Disparity in Strength Between Bus and Eastern</h3>
<p>Bus easily defeated Eastern 4-1. The two old generals in Eastern's defense can be said to be Huang Zhong and Yan Yan, but they have passed the time of conquering Dingjun Mountain. Liu Yiqiang is Liu Qingcai's "son." Looking at the lineup, one can see the disparity in strength at a glance. Fortunately, Eastern's interest in playing football is not bad.</p>
<p>The eleven players of Bus are:</p>
<p>Tan Jun'gan</p>
<p>Yi Zhenhui Mai Linfu</p>
<p>Feng Kunsheng Kong Qingyu Deng Sen</p>
<p>Li Dahui Zou Wenzhi Deng Yijie Li Chunfa Qian Chifen</p>
<p>Eastern's lineup is:</p>
<p>Yang Bin</p>
<p>Bei De Jiang Shanjing</p>
<p>Liu Yiqiang Li Dianqi Li Qiguang</p>
<p>Huang Baixiong Liu Fuquan Li Huilin Deng Guangquan Li Hongqi</p>
<h3>Kitchee Defeats Kwong Wah 4-0</h3>
<p>Kwong Wah played poorly, often being teased by Kitchee in the palm of their hand. Tan Huanzhuo was not as good as in the previous two games. Kitchee attacked more and defended less. In the first half, they first presented two goose eggs, and then sent two more in the second half. Although Kwong Wah's forwards tried their best to break the eggshell, they always failed to break through Zhu Bangban's final barrier. Even a rare penalty kick was given to Liang Baiwei to host a banquet at the Tin Hau Temple, which was too disappointing. Kwong Wah's defeat was expected, but the biggest reason was the slow and sluggish play. The final kick was always snatched away while hesitating, otherwise they could have scored one or two goals.</p>
<p>Kitchee Team</p>

<h3>On the Benefit Without Harm of Pricing in Customs Gold Units</h3>
<p>— Martin</p>
<p>Since our city's public utilities, "in coordination with financial and economic reforms," implemented the most scientific and rational Customs Gold Unit pricing method in Shanghai's history, it is expected that prices will soon fall, and the world will be in great order. The people should warmly welcome and wholeheartedly support this. However, I have recently read in various newspapers that there are many criticisms of the Customs Gold Unit pricing. Whether these people are illegal elements intentionally plotting to sabotage this most scientific and rational method is unknown and will be set aside for now. However, according to my detailed research, there are at least five benefits to pricing public utilities in Customs Gold Units, and there are almost no drawbacks. How do I know this? Listen to what I say:</p>
<p>(1) Since the Customs Gold Unit for pricing is adjusted daily and even hourly, in other words, the Gold Yuan is depreciating daily and even hourly in a "formally listed" manner. The common people will inevitably be greatly panicked and eager to spend the Gold Yuan, which is becoming less valuable by the minute. Those who receive Gold Yuan in the morning will spend it in the afternoon; those who receive it in the afternoon will spend it in the evening. In this way, the Gold Yuan issued by the Central Bank will not be hidden in boxes by the people. Since the Gold Yuan is no longer hidden in boxes, there will be plenty of Gold Yuan on the market, and the Central Bank will not need to issue large amounts of currency to "alleviate the shortage of cash." In this way, the issuance by the National Treasury will naturally stop, which is the first benefit.</p>
<p>(2) Because tram tickets need to be adjusted daily, the price is no longer printed on them. Upon investigation, Shanghai's trams have always been free of embezzlement, especially Route 1, which is particularly strict and dedicated to public service. From now on, with the price not printed on tickets, embezzlement will disappear even more, because the ticket sellers deeply fear that there is a divine presence watching them, and they are afraid that with the price not printed, they will not be able to face the heavens, so they will resolve never to embezzle. This measure will not only greatly increase the company's income but also greatly help Shanghai society's ethical concepts, which is the second benefit.</p>
<p>(3) Electricity, tap water, and gas are priced in Customs Gold Units, rising daily and increasing greatly at night. Users will inevitably be frightened and dare not use too much, to avoid bankruptcy. Those who originally ate three meals a day will change to two meals; those who originally drank boiled water will change to cold water; those who originally took a bath once a week will change to once a year. In this way, the conservation movement can be thoroughly promoted among the people without the advocacy of officials, and the conservation of materials will be clearly visible, which is the third benefit.</p>
<p>(4) After Customs Gold Unit pricing, the most unbearable are factories. Factories cannot afford electricity, so they have to reduce operating hours or close down one after another. Conversely, they will use less raw materials, which can save the country a lot of foreign exchange, and the prices of goods on the market will also fall sharply due to the factories stopping purchasing, thereby stabilizing prices, which is the fourth benefit.</p>
<p>(5) Since public utilities collect Customs Gold Units but still pay workers based on the cost of living index, they can obtain countless profits, and everyone will be happy. Moreover, the standard has been set, so there is no need to constantly pester the Public Utilities Bureau. The Public Utilities Bureau, which has always been dizzy from the word "adjustment," can now simplify its administration and enjoy peace and prosperity, truly implementing the so-called "arriving at the office with eight parts diligence and nine parts scheming, brewing tea at half past ten, reading the newspaper at eleven, and leaving work at twelve." This is the fifth benefit.</p>
<p>With these five points, it is clear that pricing public utilities in Customs Gold Units has a hundred benefits and no drawbacks. However, there is one point that I would like to suggest for improvement, which is that the pricing unit for public utilities is only equal to 0.625 Customs Gold Units, which is too little. It is best to "adjust" it to 2.625 or 3.625. In this way, public utilities can further increase their income and profits by millions, and foreign merchants will laugh heartily—this will naturally be of great benefit to promoting friendly relations.</p>
<h3>Men Look at Women</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>The "Women's Family Magazine" some time ago solicited the opinions of some famous men, asking them what they first noticed when they first saw a woman. The answers of these famous men each had different mysteries. Here are a few excerpts to express the vision of men.</p>
<p>Robert Taylor: "I pay attention to her walk. I hate a woman who walks with difficulty, as if she is about to fall; or walks too fast, like a race walker. Before you see her face, you can know a lot about this woman just by looking at the way she walks."</p>
<p>Bing Crosby: "For a woman, the first thing I notice is her eyes. If they are sparkling, it proves that she has a sense of humor and is a good companion."</p>
<p>Henry Link: "I look at women in two ways, one is to look at her during the day, and the other is to look at her personality. In restaurants, on the streets, or in other public places, I look at women with the attitude of appreciating pictures. In social gatherings, I look at their hurtful personalities. And personality is the ability of a person to interest others, the various habits of serving others. What a woman does to others can express her personality more than what she does to herself."</p>
<p>McLaren: "I pay attention to hands. Not the way the hands look, but how women use their hands."</p>
<h3>Small Matters of the World</h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>In the sea near the Malay Peninsula, there is a kind of large clam that is five feet wide and weighs hundreds of pounds each. This kind of large clam can eat people, and if a child falls into its shell, they will not survive. In the Saint Sulpice Church in Paris, there is a shell of this kind of large clam, which is used as a basin for holy water.</p>
<p>There is a lake in South Africa with peculiar water quality. If ironware is put into the lake and taken out after years, not only will it not rust, but it will also be shiny and bright, like newly cast.</p>
<p>The distant ancestors of human beings were a kind of dog-shaped reptiles. In the Karoo Desert in South Africa, fossils from 200 million years ago were excavated, which were dog-shaped reptiles. It is said that there are only two places in the world where such fossils have been discovered.</p>
<p>Soviet explorer Korshnikov, while exploring in Siberia, picked up a gold ingot in the wilderness, weighing more than 14 and a half catties. It is still unknown who left it behind.</p>
<h3>The Origin of International Women's Day</h3>
<p>— Baozhu</p>
<p>It has been exactly forty years since International Women's Day was created. Forty years ago—in 1910, due to the call of Ms. Clara Zetkin, a women's conference was held in the capital of Denmark, and March 8 was designated as International Women's Day. From that year on, it became an annual festival for women all over the world.</p>
<p>Ms. Clara Zetkin was the founder of the modern women's movement. She was German, and after graduating from a normal school, she became an elementary school teacher. At that time, due to the results of the industrial revolution, capitalism gradually matured, and labor-capital disputes also occurred, and the idea of socialism also sprouted. At that time, she met many people who had fled from Poland and Tsarist Russia to Germany, which changed her thinking and led her to join the Social Democratic Party. Later, in order to prevent the spread of social ideas, the German government promulgated the "Anti-Socialist Law," and Ms. Clara was also expelled from the country.</p>
<p>Clara left Germany and lived in Switzerland with a Russian man, Vossip Zetkin. Later, they moved to Paris and lived an exiled life. Vossip was also a teacher, and he became seriously ill during several years of exile. At that time, she already had two children. For the sake of her husband and children, she went out to teach while also writing articles to maintain her life. During these years, Ms. Clara suffered all kinds of hardships in life and also encountered the pain of exile, which made her a strong sympathizer of the oppressed and determined to fight for the oppressed.</p>
<p>In 1899, Vossip's illness became more and more serious and he died. Fortunately, at that time, the German "Anti-Socialist Law" was abolished, and Clara took her two children back to the country. After returning to Germany, she founded the "Equal Women's Magazine," dedicated to fighting for oppressed women. She advocated the women's movement and created women's welfare. This work lasted for thirteen years. Later, she founded the "International Magazine," which made the women's movement more internationalized. In 1907, the first international socialist women's conference was held, and the international socialist secretariat was established, which made the women's movement more concrete. Three years later, in 1910, at the second international socialist women's conference, it was decided that March 8 would be International Women's Day.</p>
<p>Why was March 8 chosen as Women's Day? When the European women's movement was booming, women in the New World, in order to fight for equality between men and women, gathered thousands of people to hold a demonstration and parade. At first, only women from Chicago participated, but later women from all over the United States rose up in response. It was the largest project in the women's movement and attracted the attention of various countries. This happened on March 8, 1909, so when the second international socialist women's conference was held the following year, March 8 was designated as International Women's Day. International Women's Day was born from this.</p>
<h3>On Automatic Adjustment</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>"Adjustment" has long become a polite synonym for price increase. Although it also implies the possibility of a price decrease, unfortunately, it is only a possibility. Since the words "adjust price" have been used together, there has always been an increase without a decrease.</p>
<p>Now, "automatic adjustment" is even more popular. From the trend of prices, it means that prices will be raised at any time and will no longer be "passive." In the past, general prices have always been automatically adjusted at any time, only slightly restricted during the price control period. The prices of "passively adjusted" were only limited to a few public utilities, but now they are all "liberated" and have changed from "passive" to "automatic." ——The only thing that probably remains trapped in the "passive" circle is "salary."</p>
<p>The leading "automatic hero" among public utilities is the postal and telecommunications industry, which was previously praised by the common people for its slow pace of price adjustment. Subsequently, the public utilities of this city emerged, and a "pricing unit" was set, nominally based on the Customs Gold Unit, and indirectly based on the US dollar. From then on, there was the danger of owing money for sending letters and the embarrassment of not bringing enough money to take the tram.</p>
<p>From the fact that it no longer needs to be approved by the competent authorities, the price of public utilities is automatically adjusted. However, from the way the adjusted price is generated, it is still passive. For example, the price of postal and telecommunications fees is calculated based on rice, paper, and gasoline. The price of these things, which are considered calculation standards, is adjusted, and the postal and telecommunications fees follow suit. If we analyze it further thoroughly, rice shops and paper shops also have their own cost calculation formulas. If the cost rises, their goods will follow suit. If we pursue it in this way, the culprit of "automatic adjustment" may be something other than the price itself.</p>
<p>However, no matter who the culprit that promotes the automatic adjustment of prices is, the behavior of various prices keeping up with each other over the past ten years is like a marathon without an end. Everyone is afraid of falling behind. From the perspective of a single price itself, this is "automatic adjustment"—do not fall behind other prices.</p>
<p>Let's go back and look at the salary class, which is coldly abandoned in the "passive" circle. They use a salary that is more than 300 times higher to cope with living expenses that have been verified to be more than 600 times higher; now they use a salary that is more than 600 times higher to cope with living expenses that have risen by an unknown amount. I wonder when they will be liberated and join the "automatic" marathon?</p>
<h3>The Home of a Professor: Going From Bad to Worse</h3>
<p>— Shaofei</p>
<h3>Shanghai Old Tales, Part Three: Casual Talk About the Temple of the Queen of Heaven</h3>
<p>— Gu Qi</p>
<p>The Temple of the Queen of Heaven at the foot of the Henan Road Bridge is generally called the Temple of the Heavenly Concubine by people, and it is a place that everyone in Shanghai knows. But what people don't know is that the Temple of the Queen of Heaven has undergone many changes over the centuries.</p>
<p>The earliest Temple of the Queen of Heaven was not at the foot of the Henan Road Bridge, but was built outside the Little East Gate. According to research, it was in the third year of Yuanshuo of the Song Dynasty, that is, 1100 AD, which is 850 years ago from now. The Queen of Heaven is originally a god who protects navigation, so boatmen on the sea are very pious and respectful to the Queen of Heaven. Many old-fashioned seagoing vessels have a shrine behind the helmsman, which enshrines the Queen of Heaven, and incense is burned all year round. It is said that when a ship encounters strong winds and huge waves in the river and sea, and is about to be in danger, as long as it prays for the protection of the Queen of Heaven, it can turn bad luck into good luck and have a safe journey. From this, it can also be seen that the Queen of Heaven has a close relationship with navigation. Several important coastal commercial ports, such as Ningbo and Fuzhou, have temples of the Queen of Heaven built, and they are all built very solemnly and grandly.</p>
<p>In the third year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, that is, 1853 AD, the Taiping Rebellion occurred, and the Temple of the Queen of Heaven was also burned to the ground in the war. After the war subsided, the Min-Guang shipping merchants raised funds to rebuild it on the original site. However, not long after it was built, it was burned down for the second time due to the Little Dagger Society Rebellion. It turned out that several leaders of the Little Dagger Society at that time used the Temple of the Queen of Heaven as a place for hiding and contacting each other. The Qing government went to capture them, but found nothing, so they burned the Temple of the Queen of Heaven, which was considered a plan to eradicate the nest. For the next twenty years, the Temple of the Queen of Heaven was not rebuilt.</p>
<p>In the tenth year of Guangxu, that is, 1884, it was re-surveyed and rebuilt with donations at the north foot of the Railway Road Bridge in the Public Concession, which is the current Temple of the Queen of Heaven. The so-called Railway Road Bridge is not because the road is paved with iron, but because the earliest bridges built on the Suzhou River during the Public Concession used iron bars as the skeleton and wooden boards on top, which was this bridge, so people called it the Railway Road Bridge. Since the Temple of the Queen of Heaven was built, it has been called the Queen of Heaven Temple Bridge. The current name is Henan Road Bridge. But now, most people call it the Heavenly Concubine Temple Bridge. Who first demoted the grand "Queen" to "Concubine" is unknown.</p>
