<h3>請何應欽顧孟餘組新閣　李代總統正促勸中　甘介侯邱昌渭過滬赴杭</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕李代總統所屬意之新行政院長人選均未在京致徵求同意之工作，尙須略延一二日，始克決定。傳厚崗李代總統官邸，八日晚及九日均有重要會商，京·滬·杭間長途電話亦及頻繁，截至九日晚爲上，據所獲知之確悉，李代總統仍擬請何應欽氏組閣，而顧孟餘氏則爲第二候選人。接近李代總統人士九日晚透露，監於當前時局之嚴重，新閣人選必須能使各方滿意，何。顧兩氏設被提名，必可獲得朝野擁護，而最理想者爲兩氏均能入閣，或以何應欽任院長，顧孟餘任副院長兼敎育部長，或以顧孟餘任院長，何應欽任副院長兼國防部長，果能如此配合實屬國家幸事。甘介侯·邱昌渭兩氏分赴滬·杭，卽係前往勸駕·另據記者自可靠方面獲悉：何應欽。顧孟餘兩氏已有允意，惟均附有條件，希望能有責任內閣之實權，對全體閣員有決定之自由，一般相信，此項條件非經對困難者，李代總統正考慮中，如無問題，新閣可望以嶄新堅强之陣容出現。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州九日電〕李代總統已滿意何應欽出組新閣，並將此意向何表達，並曾由京兩次長途電話與何商議組閣事，惟何氏是否業已受命，此間尙難獲悉，一般相信何氏正在考慮期中·何係八日偕其夫人公子來杭，現住裏西湖湯恩伯公館，今日上午曾與公子在湖畔散步，下午泛舟遊西湖三潭印月湖心亭等地，意態閑逸，省主席周暑隨伴同遊，今日李代總統專機及代表邱昌渭雖已來杭迎駕，但何氏似無立卽入京組閣之跡象可尋，何氏壽誕在十二日，可能仍照原定計劃在杭避壽後，再行晋京，一說日內或將前往溪口一行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕青年黨領袖李黃，定十日晨由滬乘車抵京，李氏係八日由蓉飛抵滬者，此次來京係應李代總統之邀，就當前國是貢獻意見。按新閣陣容內仍將邀請友黨協助合作。</p>
<p>〔報訊訊〕甘介侯昨晨啣命自京抵滬，勸詰何應欽及顧孟餘出組新閣，上午分訪有關人物後，旋即興邱昌渭同車赴杭，向何應欽傳達李代總統之意旨。甘氏昨日上午曾訪候顏車慶，洽商和談問題兼亦涉及組閣事，據聞甘氏表示：組閣完成後，和平運動可望有新開展，因過去政府方面病在對時局意見不一致，今後將意志集中，全力進行和談。據悉邱昌渭在滬時，曾訪及顧孟餘並與長談，據深知內情者談：何氏組閣，可能甚大，緣去秋翁內閣辭職後，當局本有借重之意，當時何氏提出政經改革及裁軍兩種方案，後者擬將國軍减縮三百萬人，以節省國庫開支，此項意見當時未被接受，故何氏表示無意組閣。據聞，李代總統對此兩項方案，均深表同」意，故何氏之組閣，什九將成爲事實。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京九日電〕此間報紙咸認李代總統決諧何應欽將軍組閣，而以　紹雄氏副之。聞何氏力主以英國工黨之政策爲藍本，在中國實行社會主義，同時則加緊地方機構之權力，俾於共黨控制聯合政府後，國民黨仍得在地方保持若干勢力。</p>
<h3>孫科等即返穗　辦理結束及移交事宜</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕孫內閣總辭獲准後，孫院長爲趕辦移交，已決定偕同副院長吳鐵城及政院各部會首長等於日內離京返穗，商討辦理結束及移交事宜之政務會議，並已決定於日內在廣州舉行。此次會議將爲孫內閣之最後一次會議，故孫，吳等必須趕返主持，刻在京之各部會首長洪蘭友，鍾天心，徐堪，劉維熾，龐松舟，吳尙鷹，關吉玉，陳雪屏等均將於一二日內先返穗，俾趕辦移交，移交之所以必須在穗辦理者，蓋因政院大印現在廣州，且各部會之公文檔案及卷宗等均已遷運抵穗也。孫院長俟辦理移交後，將返漢門故里一行，探視老母，開孫氏短期內將在港小住休養。政院秘書長端木愷，水利部長鍾天心，交部代部長凌鴻勛，九日夜車赴滬，候機返穗，趕辦移交。九日下午四時孫院長在政院一號官邸邀集徐永昌顧祝同，翁文灝，徐堪等四人舉行會談，商討核减軍費及軍費核實等問題，歷一小時許始散。</p>
<h3>穗中央機關　尙未奉令北遷</h3>
<p>〔聯合社廣州九日電〕此間中外官員今日僉認：行政院長孫科辭職，非謂國府卽將還都南京。據一部份使館人員稱：預料尙將留穗至少兩月。還京與否，大致須視和談成敗而定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京九日電〕美大使館發言人稱，現尙無計劃以召還前隨政院赴穗之美外交人員。</p>
<p>〔路透社廣州九日電〕行政院副秘書長頃否認國內所傳業已下令政府機關自穗遷返南京之說。渠謂任何關於此事之決定，須待新行政院長任命後，始能成立，渠個人認爲在穗之中央機關或不致遷回南京，一則由於南京並不安全，一則由於在京各機關原址，頗多爲軍隊佔用，一時無法出空之故。</p>
<h3>陳濟棠抵京　陳誠等日內可到</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕李代總統邀約東南各地軍政首長入京，徵詢對國是之意見，海南島行政長官陳濟棠，九日晨應召抵京，並卽於午前晋謁李代總統長談·台主席陳誠因召開行政會議關係，一尙未啓程。李代總統九日特派專機一架飛合迎接，預料陳氏一二日內可來京。至閩主席朱紹良，粵主席薛岳，穗綏署主任余漢謀等，尙無來京確期。陳濟棠氏係於八日由港飛抵滬，粵省黨部主委林翼中同行，九日晨陳·林兩氏由滬乘車抵京時，白祟禧，李漢魂，李宇淸等均在站歡迎·</p>
<p>〔本報台北九日電〕李代總統來電邀陳誠赴京，陳氏二三日內當可成行。</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州九日電〕據此間獲悉，李代總統曾有電致馬鴻逵」保於十七日以前來京會晤，馬氏將於最近期內由寗夏逕飛京。迎馬專機一二日可抵寗夏·又馬氏糖尿病仍無起色，此次飛京出席某種會議後，將赴滬港療治。</p>
<h3>政治革新方案起草會　在立院開首次會　認行政機構應切實裁併</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕立院政治革新方案起草委會，九日晨九時牛舉行第一次會議，出席委員四十餘人，鄒樹文主席，各委員紛紛發言，對現行政治制度，人事政策諸端，均有論列，咸主立院旣爲權力機關，亦當爲決策機關，若實仃法治，非發揮立院職權不可，行政機構過於冗雜繁複，應切實栽併，並淘汰冗員，確定公務員之任職保障，各機關之職權應予劃淸，提高地方權力，中央不得事事千涉。有人並主張推派立委數人赴溪口，晋謁蔣總統，討論至十二時未獲結論，當決定十日晨九時繼續開會商討。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕立院和平方案起草委會，九日晨開第一次會，出席委員三十餘人，黃宇人主席，復建議舉行秘密會，致各報記者均被摒於門外，會中討論熱烈，發言者甚多，僉認和平爲人民股切需要，立院應爭取對人民有利之和平，當推定江一平·楊玉淸·盧郁文·張翼文·黃宇人等五人負責起草意見書，由黃宇人執筆。五人小組定十日晨十時開會研究後，於十日下午三時舉行之起草委會第二次會中討論，再向大會報吿，至十二時散會。</p>
<h3>和談方案初稿完成　爲减輕民困不惜最大犧牲　對將來國際地位尤爲重視</h3>
<p>孫科召集　十人委會</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕政府和談方案之初步意見，九日上午經孫科召集十人起草小組委會，作最後之研討及綜合歸納後，其意見之紀錄初稿，已於九日下午送呈李代總統。初步意見中，除根據中共八項條件所提之對案，已迭於前電中報道外，茲據靈通方面消息，其中尙包括一部分無法歸納於中共八項條件以內之新意見，此項意見以備於外交性者爲多，卽在將來聯合政府成立後，中國在國際上將爲何種地位，各起草蘭之先例，意見中特別指出，將應保持其獨立性，決不能作任何國家附庸。至中共八項條件中若干具體問題，政府起草和平方案各委負交換意見時，對於凡有助於眞正永久和平之實現者，均不惜作最大之犧性與讓步，期能結束多年來之紛亂局面，以减輕人民之痛苦。九日孫科召集之十人小組起草委會，係於上午十時在政院一號官舍舉行，出席者計邵力子·吳鐵城·張羣·鍾天心·朱家驊·劉斐等七人，對於和平方案之初步意見，曾再度作詳盡之研討，而同時因孫·吳·鍾等均將赴穗趕辦移交，無法繼續草擬正式方案，故決定先行送呈李代總統，俟何應欽·張治中。吳忠信等歸來後，再由李代總統決定是否另增起草委員，抑再行討論。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕某和平代表自京返滬，縱談時局，謂截至此時爲止，國民黨內部對和談之意見尙未一致。孫閣之總辭，就大局及和談言，頗可惋惜，因孫閣不辭，至少可爲代總統分憂，今日則需獨任難巨矣。就和談而言，一切須俟內閣組成，代表正式產生後，方能進行，時間上可能較預定略遲。就個人所知，中共之和談陣容，早已內定，故和談之是否能早日舉行，關鍵尙在政府。連日共軍陳兵江北，戰意甚濃，但個人認爲目的在擺出一種陣勢，一使其發生精神上之作用，而不致卒然渡江，否則對於中共之信用，影響太大。在北平之會商中，共方僅指出，以八點爲談判之先決條件或談判之基礎均無不可，未聞要求以控制京滬爲和談之先決條件，個人認爲，和談之核心問題並不在此。</p>
<h3>國防部任李卓元　爲虎門要塞司令</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州九日電〕據廣州綏署息：國防部頃任命李卓元爲虎門要塞司令。</p>
<h3>毛澤東未到北平</h3>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕據北平消息，二月下旬一度盛傳中共主席毛澤東已抵達北平，但毛氏現在的確尙未抵平·截至目前爲止，中共在平的地位最高的人物，爲人民解放軍副總司令彭德懷。</p>
<h3>陝國軍克復富平　豫南紅槍會攻入桐柏城　蘇北戰塲並無重大變化</h3>
<p>〔中央社西安九日電〕西安綏署政工處九日發表戰報：國軍九日上午十時收復富平，共軍紛向蒲城耀縣逃竄。</p>
<p>〔本報信陽九日電〕確息：豫南民衆自動組織之紅槍會七萬餘，爲反杭共軍强征兵糧，昨起紛在豫鄂邊區大舉襲擊土共·據今午消息，今晨九時，紅槍會一萬餘人，已攻入桐柏縣城（豫境）並在草店等地奪得共軍庫糧十餘萬斤，步槍四千餘枝，衝鋒槍四十挺，輕機槍十七挺，手槍二百餘枝？</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江九日電〕蘇北戰塲無重要變動，共軍對未來之渡江行動，自有其必作之準備，而國軍方面之如何求進一步鞏固長江防務，亦爲一重要課題。最近常州綏靖會議在湯恩伯氏主持下召開，以及湯氏之視察江防，均可爲上述情事之註腳。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江九日電〕軍事當局爲防止共軍偷渡，除加強江北岸橋頭堡兵力外，鎭江縣屬大港地區，九日由國軍某部接防。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江九日電〕駐鎭第四軍九十師，定十日中午在牒灣高一地草坪上實彈演習迫擊砲機關槍一射擊。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江九日電〕外傳長江下遊江面業由軍方宣告封鎖，記者特以此走訪此間陸海軍當局，據談：所謂「封鎖」，僅係長江南北岸若干港口間航運由軍方加以管制，所有民間船隻或商用輪船，可在軍方准許通航之港口間及指定之時間內南北對岸航駛，至於沿江上下航運並不在此項禁令限制以內。軍方人士又稱：封鎖長江當視軍事局面之演變而決定，目前尙無採取此一揹施之必要。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕海總息：七日晚長江下游口岸附近龍窩地區橋頭堡以北二百公尺附近，小股共軍圖　動，經我陸海陸海協同將來犯共軍擊退，泰興西南天星橋一帶共軍，連日機築工事極爲忙碌，經海軍以重砲悉予轟毀。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京九日電〕鎭江電話稱：長江北岸之儀徵城，八日夜有共軍三千藉砲火之掩護進攻，至九日晨已被擊退，共方死傷約共四百名。軍方人士對於北岸瓜洲確况拒不透露。</p>

<p>〔本報青島九日電〕據傳，現任十一綏區司令劉安祺，將調任台灣省警備副司令。</p>
<h3>龔德柏恢復撰評</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京九日電〕救國日報主筆襲德柏已釋出，九日照常執筆撰述評綸。該報停刊三日後，業已重行出版。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約八日電〕先驅論壇報社論八日稱：南京救國日報編者襲德柏，撰評被禁，渠在國民黨領土內，表現此勇氣，不過遭受短期監禁，如渠在共黨區表示同樣蠻勇而建議毛澤東出國，則後果必更嚴重，「中國國民政府對言論自由之紀錄，並不完全，但較共黨爲好：在多數中國人民未有充足之食物以生存時，西方政府學說能否在中國生根，實爲可疑」。</p>

<p>〔合衆社中國分社社長高爾雅溪口八日電〕孫科之辭職，八日對居於此間環山村莊之曾爲蔣總統官員之少數人士，並非驚奇事。與總統有密切接觸之人士，雖表示孫科下台久已料及，但不願發表對和平運動影響之評述。本記者在溪口兩日中所接觸之人士，皆一致宣稱：蔣總統已令彼等與渠一月廿二日離南京時採同一立塲，卽已離開中國政治圈，但非正式地，此等人士—約伴蔣赴溪口人數之半—同意稱，孫科之政院在和平運動方面有甚多需要改進之處，此爲蔣氏放棄總統職之理由。蔣氏本人與外界之正式接觸，實際已完全分離。渠甚少接見賓客，並須有重要事務之高級人員。政府和平代表及可能爲孫科繼承人之張治中，爲訪客中之最遲去者，渠於六日赴溪口。蔣總統現僅有私人侍從二人—一副官，一秘書—彼等辦理其一切事務，其中之一在回答合衆社所問是否蔣仍與政治及軍事有關時稱：「他如何能？只用一位秘書」？渠並率直否認所傳蔣仍發布命令事。蔣氏並未以沈思默想消磨其時間，渠幾乎每日外出週遊，一人稱：「渠使吾等腿酸，渠爬山，並乘竹筏在河中遊蕩，渠作徒步旅行，並使吾等同行」。此間甚少特別軍事戒備之象徵。本記者在自寗波至溪口之三十五哩行程中，未曾一次被阻，蔣氏約共有衛士廿人，並無正規軍駐紮之衆徵。</p>
<h3>陶希聖大穗談話</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州八日電〕國民黨中宣部副部長陶希聖，八日招待中外記者，答覆詢問時稱：蔣總統引退後，卽以在野之身，支持李副總統，並且無意復職，不論將來是和是戰，亦唯有李代總統及責任內閣決定之。渠現住溪齋，完全以平民身份，在憲法上規定人民有居住·宗敎·集會·結社·言論·出版之目由，在國民黨黨員亦有接受蔣總栽領導之自由，但幷非卽爲干涉政治。但中國國民革命軍係由蔣總栽領導廿餘年，渠對軍士生活之關心，爲人情所必然，但渠自不行使總統職權後，一切軍事已交李代總統及參謀總長所指揮，因國民黨早已將軍隊交與國家，現有者均爲國軍，非黨軍，總裁自無支配國軍權力也。氏並稱，渠相信蔣總統最近不會來穗及赴京或台灣，外傳一切均屬中傷謠言。氏又談，蔣總統過去政治措施不一定全對，但渠自北伐至抗戰勝利，對國家之貢獻，應爲吾人懷念，恐除共黨而外，無人能否認其功在國家者。某記者詢以李代總統主政後，有若干手令如釋放張學良等，何以不能順利執行，氏答稱：依憲法爲總統有權，內閣有責，過去蔣總統所發手令，必先經政院通過決定，始由總統頒布，而李代總統一月廿四日之聲明及手令，均未與政院意見疏通，因而引起若干誤會，且李代總統聲明原則上接受毛澤東之八項條件，則將來爲和爲降，因引起一部人士之懷疑。至和談問題，氏稱，此在共黨是否眞有誠意，國軍現僅於防禦地位而已。至和談之進行，仍在南京決定，以渠推測，時間可能拖至很長。氏最後對國民黨內部是否會改組問題答稱：一般同志均望能有效的改革。</p>

<h3>社論　上海房租的新標準</h3>
<p>上海市地政局爲求擬訂中之房租新標準公平合理起見，特於本月八日召集了房客聯合總會，房地產同業公會，曁有關工商主管機關，交換房租新標準的意見。據說：會商的結果，通過了兩項原則：（一）根據土地法第九十七條爲基礎，訂定新標準；（二）根據每月兩次發表之生活指數計算房租，惟基數比照戰前打一極大折扣，修理費歸房客負擔。同時各方希望新標準須富於彈性，避免硬性規定，力求减少糾紛。地政局根據上述意見，正着手重新修改擬訂中之房租新標準，大約最短期間可望完成，一俟市政會議審查後送市參議會討論，即可成爲定案。</p>
<p>上海市房屋畸形的恐慌，房客和房地產業同樣蒙受影響，一致要求合理的調整。地政局爲適應各方面的要求，正擬制定房租新標準，以爲合理解決畸形房荒，不但是必要，而且立意是很好的。現在値得研討的，是新標準是否爲一種合理標準，及新標準是否能突破畸形房荒現象。（</p>
<p>都市房荒是大戰後發生的嚴重現象，這個問題關係人民的居住問題。此不獨上海爲然，亦不獨中國的都市爲然。大戰後的各國政府，他們在立法上行政上克盡資任，爲人民，爲社會解決了居住問題。美國各城市未被轟炸，可是戰時的男女都結了婚。一且復員，丈夫回了家，都希望有一個新的住所，於是房荒就在美國發生了。國會注意它，政府關心它，用力量解決它，現在美國已無嚴重的房荒。莫斯科，烏克蘭，白俄羅斯，這些地方的人民在大戰中流離失所，蘇聯政府很快的注意它，不待完成德軍的繳械工作，他們便亦廢墟上建築新的房屋，蘇聯人民今天已無居住匱乏之虞，英國在大戰期內未造房屋，傾廢的也不能修理被摧毀的也等待拆除，於是戰後倫敦發生嚴重的房荒。但自工黨執政以後，把人民住所問題看作與國營法案同等重要而迫切，所以工黨執政的一年中，便在國會通過了三大法案，作有計劃的建築，並獎勵私人建築，各地方政府更在「限制房租」法案之下，設立了租房仲裁法庭，解決了許多的租賃糾紛。就以戰敗國的日本來說，東京被炸區現已復興起來，廣島廢墟的建築進行更迅速，外國記者前往廣島參觀，非常驚異日人的建設精神·如上所述，不問大戰的戰勝與戰敗，他國的政府都對人民的居住問題有所作爲·祗有找國的情形爲例外，不但多數人流離無住所，甚至房屋最多的都市，也竟會發生畸形的房荒，而尤以上海的情形爲最嚴重。</p>
<p>誠如以上所說，上海房荒完全是畸形的。依據若于統計分析，上海市居住六百萬人口，假使對房屋能有合理的分配辦法，對房租能有合理的保陣辦法，應該人人有適宜的房屋居住。今天上海握有房地產的業主，他們的收入少得可憐，直接使合法的財產得不到保障，間接則使今後沒有個人也沒有公司願意投資於建築房屋。而另一方面，眞正守法的房客，却又不能正當取得合法合理的房屋租賃。這兩者之中，唯有「二房東」却可操縱一切，以房租的租賃獲取黃金外匯或食米，於是造成空前的房荒。市塲上與風作浪的游資，不願投入地產，雖在金圓券發行之初，地產業曾有一剎那的興旺交易，不轉瞬而又乏人問津，這與戰前的情形完全兩樣·接收敵僞的房屋，被有權勢的人佔有，不黑不白的現象，從無人予以干涉。聽說至今還有被人非法佔有，不付買價，不付房租，而公然使用。此種不合理的現象，發展三年多，而始終沒有解決。房地產業主於是要求政府根據土地法規定，調整房租標準，爭取合法的收益；房客受房租糾紛的壓迫，組織了房客聯合會，要求政府限制增加房租，並保護其居住利益。地政局在兩面夾攻之中，爲職責關係，擬定了房租新標準草案，預備於各方同意後，立即頒佈施行。這種應該辦的事，恐怕今後不能再拖了吧！</p>
<p>都市房荒的解決，及合理的租賃關係之調整，戰後國民政府於卅六年十二月一日，公佈有「房屋租賃條例」一種，這是一件很好的社會立法。如果上海在行政上能指施貫澈，上海市的畸形房荒，確乎可以消滅。可惜上海市政府並不十分重視它，更無勇氣來執行它，上海的市參議會也在羣言龐雜之中，設法躱避這個足以引起麻煩的問題而不想觸及它，以致去年三月間所定的七千倍九千倍的標準，有名無實的虛懸着。政府和民意機關實在都不負責！現在地政局集曾通過的兩項原則，第一項根據土地法第九十七條訂定新標準，即房租以不超過土地及其建築物申報總價額年息百分之十爲準則，這將令房地產業公會的業主，可以滿意，因爲他們的財產收益，可望獲得了保障。其次，第二項根據生活指數作計算房租標準，再打極大的折扣，這大約是房客聯合會的意見。另據房客聯合會的建議，新房租可以戰前一元折合四分或五分爲基數，再倍生活指數，設果採此項建議，這將使房客的負担不致過分沉重。兩者意見似已可望獲得協調，但如何突破房屋的中間頂替，限制房屋轉租，使人人負担合理的租金，而合法直接取得房屋的租賃，則毫無決定，依然是相當遺憾的事。</p>
<p>上海房荒的確很嚴重，需要澈底的解決。增加房租，保障業主合理合法的收益，並無人反對。眞正守法的承租人，實在亦願遵守契約。可是今天上海畸形房荒的造成，迫使業主和眞正承租人兩方蒙受不利的，乃是專以轉租轉頂爲事的非法「二房東」二、羣人。如果不依「房屋租賃條例一，切實施行，取締轉頂，則上海房荒的惡風，依舊存在，對人民，對社會，仍無利益可言。此則頗望市政當局注意及之！</p>
<h3>「耕者有其田」之創舉　龍岩完成土地改革　全縣境內均爲自耕農乞丐盜竊絕跡　鄰近六縣開始同樣改革</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州九日電〕中國農村復興聯合委會主委蔣夢麟，九日語記者稱：農復會頃已決定撥款補助閩西龍岩等七縣之土地改革實施工作，此爲我國實施土地改革完成「耕者有其田」之創舉。龍岩縣實施土地改革之成就及附近六縣之實驗工作，蔣氏認爲係我國今後土地改革應爲採取之正確途徑，而農復會現正全力協助是項實騐之推展。蔣氏稱：「農復會此」措施，對改造及安定當前中國之社會經濟及秩序上將有深切影響。按龍岩縣爲大江以南完成土地改革之唯一地區，其改革成效已開始顯著。」蔣氏續稱：「據本會此次調查結果，該地區農民生活與農業生產之改進，與改革前一年相較，已達百分之廿，全縣境內現均爲自耕農民，乞丐盜竊絕跡，此項成效，已誘使其他毗連地區之地主歡迎改革。現第七區專員公署已在與龍岩毗連之永定·武平·上杭三縣開始同樣之土地改革，其他長汀·潭平·連城三縣將列入於第二期中開始，並定於一年內全部完成。」記者另悉農復會已決定援助之範圍爲：（一）保持並擴大土地改革已經完成後之效果，該會對龍岩縣農民將撥給資金增加農業生產，促進土地利用，並加强自耕農之經濟地位，因該地農民均爲自耕，故由於前項援助所產生之種種利益，將無地主分潤而全部歸諸農民享受。（二）對其他正在實施土地改革之六縣將補助其實施改革經費，俾土地改革計劃得能切實實行與迅速完成，完成之地區亦可以照龍岩辦法，再予補助，以改進其農業生產。該會深信以此種方式給予之援助，必能使農民直接蒙受利益不致虛擲。</p>

<h3>遠東經濟堡壘　匯豐銀行業務中心　由中國移向東亞　英商在當前局勢中的新轉變</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港六日航訊〕香港商人「在商言商」的動態，記者在上次通訊中已有報道，但那些話大部份是指華商而言，而外國商人，尤其是英國商人的態度如何，相信也爲國內一般人士所注意。一年一度英國在遠東最大經濟堡壘匯豐銀行的報吿書恰巧在昨天發表，這個報吿書裏的話，很可替我們繪出英國商人當前的面目來。</p>
<p>「中國交戰的雙方，都有決心在最短期內把中國工業化作爲一個解救農民困苦的一個手段。這個動向的必要條件，莫如改良交通工具，尤其是鐵路和內河航行系統，倘不欲拖長這個改進的實現，則機器工具和海外投資都不可少。因此，我們不應該忽視我們在中國的地位。」</p>
<p>這是匯豐銀行董事長兼總經理摩斯在那個報吿書裏所說的一段話。他透視過了一個「正在陷入內戰中，行政系統鬆弛，而財政組織又受軍事所支配，被迫放棄其維持收支平衡的企圖，而依賴通貨膨脹的財政，以維持其逐日的需要」的國度，看見一個美麗的遠景，他昭吿英國商人說：「我的愚見以爲，所有在中國從事對外貿易的商人，必須準備應付未來數年間的一個完全嶄新的局面，毫無任何前例的，把他們的觀念和行動適應那個新環境。」摩斯還肯定的說：中國必須從外國輸入消費品和機器，拿輸出去交換輸入。換言之，不論中國變到怎麼田地，中國也要和外國通商，英國商人還是加緊抓着中國這個市塲吧。</p>
<p>別要從遙遠的美景看，就是根據過去一年間匯豐銀行發行增加一億一千二百多萬港元，而獲純利一千六百七十九萬二千元，每股派息五鎊的事實，英國商人也不會輕易放棄經營了百年以上的中國市塲。匯豐銀行也就是在華英商的一個最高的代表。</p>
<p>但摩斯盱衡遠東全局，却不得不承認在通貨膨脹的情勢下，數字是騙人的，政治的糾紛，外匯的管制和其他業務上的限制，已使英商遭遇到很大的阻力。他提示了一個十分重要的事實：匯豐銀行的業務中心，已逐漸由中國而轉移於東南亞，匯豐銀行新加坡分行的重要性，現已日見增加。摩斯一面促請英商「不該忽略我們在中國的地位」，一面宣佈把英國在遠東最大經濟堡壘的中心移開了中國，這個轉變很値得我們注意。</p>
<p>匯豐銀行的業務中心爲什麼要退出中國？摩斯沒有具體說明。他祗輕描淡寫的：「時局展望不可預測，卽就全世界以言，目前不安定的情勢，亦較我們記憶裏的任何時期爲甚。我覺得，中國的未來大大有賴於世界形勢的轉變，尤以蘇聯與西方國家間的關係爲然。」</p>
<p>我們不得不驚嘆英人這點遠見，但根據上文所述，我們不能解釋匯豐銀行這個新轉變，就是英商放棄中國市塲的預兆。　摩斯的報吿中，，還列舉匯豐銀行與香港最近廿年來發展的關係，也値得一提。他說：廿年前，香港人口僅有八十萬，現在幾達二百萬，當年港府歲收約二千三百五十萬，現已逾一億五千萬元，當年匯豐銀行資產負債表爲七億一千萬元，現爲廿六億六千五百萬元。當年發行鈔票不及六千五百萬元，去年十二月底爲七億二千八百萬元。去年的活期存款已超過十億元。從這些數字看，匯豐銀行與香港是不可分離的。從匯豐銀行看，香港在今日中國經濟所佔地位，也一目暸然。</p>

<h3>金銀市塲未正式成立前　國行擴大配售範圍　加委行局信託部及銀樓代售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨下午五時許，曾爲金鈔市價之波動，由該行劉總裁邀集各關係方面商討今後金銀對策，結果以方案未臻成熟階段，預定會後發佈之新聞，臨時欲發又止。旋據該行業務局局長林崇語記者，關於黃金之拋售，在金銀公開市塲尙未正式成立前，國行正在考慮擴大配售範團，以便有更多之機構代國行拋售黃金，委託銀樓業者，不過為一開端。至昨日（卽九日）配價與實際市價脫節一點，國行當將注意及之，今（十日）起當顧全實際，相機訂定合理之配價。</p>
<p>又據可靠消息，國行拋售黃金將同時委託各國家行局之信託部同時辦理，以期普遍供應云。</p>
<p>金價繼續上漲　銀樓門庭若市</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日金市，因受戰局及銀根鬆動之影響，繼續堅昂。金市逼近三關時，本市各銀樓飾金掛牌仍屹立於每兩廿六萬七千元之水準。影響所及，昨日上午各銀樓莫不門庭若市，頓有應接不暇之感。而各銀樓以限於頭寸，向國行請購有限，故門市應售，大多以一二錢左右之綫戒爲限，超過此數者，大多遭受櫃員婉却。而南京路上若干銀樓，未至十一時，卽已宣吿售罄。午後則多高掛停售牌照。而是時黃金市價，則已竄出三關。該業公會理事長吳彭年等，以銀樓業在此金價波動之浪潮中，深感處境困難，無法維持正常之營業，當於中午時赴訪國行業務局長林崇墉。經面陳困難。</p>
<p>抑制金價波動　准許銀樓代售</p>
<p>國行當局卽決定請金管局准許本市銀樓業自卽日起，除原經營之手飾金業務外並接受國行委託，代售黃金條塊。售價照國行配價，另加手續費兩成。此外並不負担保安捐營業稅等費用，故昨日國行配價每兩爲廿五萬元，而各銀樓下午條塊之門市價，每兩爲廿五萬五千元。國行於昨日中午一時許，始決定委由各銀樓在門市拋售條塊，名義雖爲接受各銀樓無限制申請配購，惟各銀樓以囿於頭寸，納胃不强，結果請購者僅九十餘家，請購數額僅三千一百餘兩，國行當全部照配。購金之款，限於當日下午四時以前，以現款，本票，或支票繳交國行。今後各銀樓業務，將劃分條塊及手飾金兩部門。各銀樓於上午十時開業前，將先由領組與國行當局洽詢當日行市後，卽根據掛牌營業，一方面準備向國行辦理申購手續。</p>
<h3>國家行局差入雖鉅　銀根鬆勢並未稍歛　今日結款頗鉅走勢恐將看緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根，初開順隔日鬆勢，惟日拆仍屹立五六角之間。後以鬆勢依舊，且傳某地劃來鉅額頭寸，仍彌留市塲間，故日拆亦步瀉至四角半五角半有供。惟下午二時過後，市塲忽傳銀錢業交換時有停止接受申請書之說，銀根一度轉俏，惟日拆仍未過六角。嗣後證實不確，銀根轉鬆。故全日銀根起伏有限，日拆亦始終在五六角間盤旋。雖國家行局以拋售外匯移轉證及配售銀樓業黃金等關係，差入一一六九三八萬元，惟國庫支出浩繁，銀根未能轉緊。其他洋商各行差入三二七八〇萬元，大交換各行差出四三六一七萬元，小交換各行差出一〇六一〇一萬元。今日有棉紗結款約達十一億元，如國行再及時拋售黃金或其他物資，而國庫無特殊支撥，則今日銀根應轉緊俏。</p>
<h3>銀行公會通函會員　遵守票據交換時間</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀行公會以近日票據流通張數突增，對交換時間影響殊鉅。按原定交換時間，票據交換開始時間爲下午二時正，約三刻鐘可交換完畢。而各行送票時限，爲下午一時一刻以前。退票補足時間，限爲下午八時以前·近來則脫時過久，送票常須延至下午三時左右，故交換常須延至下午三時半，方能開始。而退票時間，則常延至入晚十時左右，値此宵禁時間，票據交換所殊感不便，故昨由銀行公會通函所屬會員，務請遵守票據之交換時間云。</p>
<h3>中港協定實施後　華南走私已好轉</h3>
<p>中央銀行駐港代表林雜英氏近由港來滬述職，並請示今後工作方針。記者爲明瞭香港方面最近金融動態及中港約定實施後之各項情形，特趨訪林氏。據吿自中港協定正式簽字實施以來最見成效者，厥爲華南各地盛極一時之走私風氣，已大部摸滅。香港方面各行莊對於金圓券之兌換，亦均能按照我國規定辦理。目前所唯一比絞成問題者，爲申匯市場之復活。關於此事，林氏認爲一方面固有待港方之合作，另一方面亦必須先求取國內經濟情况之安定云。</p>

<p>由於政局之沉悶，故昨日華股市勢先堅後疲，市呈欲振乏力之勢。銀根雖已趨鬆，然人心極不振。證劵帮及銀行帮大戶皆集中黃金扒吸，雖偶染指，亦卽逢高拋出，獲利了結。散戶尤抱戒心，未敢輕易下手。故圈外黃金雖吿上楊，股市且趨虛軟。永紗初開五元三角五分，聞港匯縮短，漸被拉高，最高做至五元六角三分。廣帮及一六八號逢高拋出，市勢又慘落。十一時三十分，塲內行情漸趨混亂，讓受價竟有五分之巨·一時行情暴瀉，最小曾做五元三角三分。近收證劵帮上抬，市勢稍被拉高至五元三角八分收盤。美亞賡續疲退，開盤一元八角二分，最高一元八角七分，最低一元六角七分，收盤一元六角九分。</p>
<p>塲外黃金雖吿引綫直上，直破三字大關，然場內掛牌且仍見不振，交易亦無甚起色。最高僅做十五萬七千元，最低十四萬八千元，下午最高十八萬元，收盤十六萬二千元，成交二百四十八兩云。</p>
<p>外股續俏</p>
<p>外股市况，由於業中銀根轉趨鬆弛，市勢賡續上揚，各帮皆有納胃，散戶亦見扒吸，故市勢續呈堅穩。怡和紗廠做一萬〇五百元，一萬〇七百元，較上日軋升達二成左右。英聯仍趨堅勢，做一千二百五十元，一千三百五十元，較上日升起二百七十元之譜。怡啤挺起四百元，做一千八百元，一千九百元。會德豐再創新高峯，爲三萬一千元與三萬三千元。其他各股，亦升一二成光景。</p>
<h3>國行小型工廠貸款　十九日起暫告結束</h3>
<p>緊急工貸仍繼續辦理</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會小型工廠貸款審查委員會，昨舉行第四次審查會議，出席顏耀秋等多人，通過小型工貸案件一千九百一十件。</p>
<p>國行自本年一月中，以時値農歷年關，爲救濟本市小型工廠起見，舉辦小型工廠貸款以來，迄今二閱月，經先後核准貸款之小型工廠，已有八千餘家，約佔本市工廠百分之八十以上。</p>
<p>放出之貸款，在五億元左右，使各業得安渡難關。最近以申甲請者，已寥廖無幾，昨該會決議該項小型工廠貸款，至三月十九日止，暫吿段落，以後如有需要，再行舉辦。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕國行貼放委員會之緊急工貸，仍繼續辦理，並卽將開辦定貨貸款，以供給生產資金云</p>
<h3>粗細紗一致激升　棉布向高峯挺進</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市勢猛竄，蓋華南諸帮及同業申請南運，數量大多已經批准，故塲內交易異常活躍，兼之金融與業外物品均皆報挺，人心一致向高，執戶無意拋出，買戶爭相搜購，致呈供不應求之勢，結果各紗較前狂升二成左右。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳晨開卽破二百萬元大關，見二百〇二萬新高，最後再哄抬二百十八萬元，激挺四十萬元。三二支銀月暴漲二十四萬元，二一支雙馬現貨自一百〇七萬元猛晋至一百十七萬元爲最高，終爲一百十五萬元，劇跳二十四萬三千元，廠單午爲一百十四萬五千元。二〇支除雙蜜蜂及如意外，均在一百萬元關外成交，一六支光明亦接近一百萬元，爲九十七萬元，餘紗普創新高。</p>
<p>布市重起漲風，良以市上銀根漸鬆，且傳千元大票又將出龍，致人心突形振奮，粵帮大量吸收，本街亦不願坐視，逢低力進，市價劇烈跳躍。</p>
<p>龍頭細布由三萬八千八百元開出，一度曾低至三萬七千八百元，臨收聞棉紗報漲，買氣頓吿洶湧，價乃竄出四萬元大關，至四萬〇五百元結束，猛挺六千七百元。喇叭童細布三萬七千八百元，較前激升五千二百元，四君子元嗶嘰自三萬八千五百元開出，中途曾低見三萬七千五百元後，卽吿騰昇，終以三萬九千四百元收市，暴漲六千五百元。</p>
<p>此外色布曁花布等，莫不向新高峯猛晋，午後因赤金上揚，塲外喊價再見高昻，聞龍頭細布四萬五千元，四君子元嘰四萬四千五百元，最後微吿回小。</p>
<h3>中紡拋紗</h3>

<h3>市塲散步　看台客</h3>
<p>漲風猶未眞性肉幕已很複雜　利息特價同飛弄巧成拙有份</p>
<p>昨各市漲風猛烈，據說內容十分複雜：</p>
<p>（一）香港申匯大縮，前晚九角六分，昨開卽是八角八分，港一元要一二五〇金元，在目前而論，不能不令人咋舌。</p>
<p>（二）孫院長辭職，廣州市面大哄動，據說湘帮在穗拋出六十大箱大鈔，套購港紙，再吸金鈔。本市呢，廣帮也大施活躍，一致猛扒。這風潮，發生在月中發薪之前，故雖未可謂眞性漲風，但基本趨勢，着實挺硬。</p>
<p>（三）孫院長在立院宣佈辭職，同時也宣佈本年度財政虧空五億八千多萬美元，這消息，有人說是孫院長拆爛汚，但總不失爲眞話。眞相公開，那能不使人眼睛更明亮些？</p>
<p>（四）軍事上，政治上，每個傳說，都是利多的，這也是基太因素之一。</p>
<p>（五）外匯移轉證央行收價上漲，證明央行對於流通在外的溢額貨，實在睏不着，不能不想法回籠點。</p>
<p>（六）大票正大量流出，爲了月中發薪起見，新的洪流，雖是構成漲風的原因之一，却也適應了時要的。</p>
<p>（七）更重要的現實因素，便是利息了。昨天漲度雖不小，但週一拖進的，合合利息，還是不夠些。水漲船高，這是不移之理</p>
<p>暗息不說，卽按銀錢業掛牌息五十元計算，假使用一萬元本錢放拆息，五個月連本帶利，就要變成一千一百九十二萬四千四百八十元，這是多麼可怕的數字。拆息尙且如此，物價自然要漲得更加厲害了。</p>
<p>雖則如此，高利息政策，在當局別有暗作用。因爲風潮來時，當局苦無對策，豈不難爲情。有此一策，大可粉飾過去。那就是漲風猛烈時，可以辣辣辣拉高利息，使游資暫時轉向。但有暫時效力，已可表演些本領出來，對上對下，都可以交代交代。</p>
<p>但是這裏有一個條件，漲風若和利息參次上漲，當局的這種打算，才能如願以償。假使漲風和利息同時上漲，那末火上添油，就變成畫蛇添足了</p>
<h3>受銀根鬆濫影響　食米又見猛跳　門售白粳高喊三萬元</h3>
<p>米市昨日又見狂跳，銀根鬆為主要原因，更以金價上漲在前，人心堅昻，喊價提升頗鉅。北市塲各米普漲三千元，白粳高做二萬八千元，特粳迫近三萬元，做二萬九千五百元。南市塲白粳二萬七千元，漲二千元，早薄稻均漲二千元，二市到貨七千五百四十八石，下午門售白粳已有高達三萬元者。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美輪諾門賴克期號，由美運來麵粉一千八百包，棉花五千四百九十餘件，昨日抵滬。</p>
<p>食汕　因銀根之鬆弛，反動猛漲，生菜油初開十萬〇三千，最後高達十一萬元，豆油收市十一萬五千尙買不進，各升一萬七至一萬九千元，吉桶生油漲一萬五千，開十三萬八千元。豆餅狂騰一千五百元，小車蔴油做十二萬五千。</p>
<p>麵粉　在銀根鬆濫下，市勢突飛猛晋，兵船猛挺二成，中途曾因阜豐廠拋售，一度見低，後市大戶力吸客帮胃口亦濃，臨收高做一萬二千一百元，老車登一萬二千五百五十元高峯，紅蜂。建成均做一萬二千元。麩皮客銷甚暢，亦挺成半以上，大包麩皮做九千七百元。</p>
<p>雜糧　市勢激升，黃豆普挺二成以上，車豆一度高喊二萬七千元，冬豆客帮依然活躍，猛挺二成左右，臨收創二萬七千元新價，喊價高達二萬九千元，生仁挺升三成，揚州生仁猛叩七萬關，芝蔴漲成半，苞米疾升二成。</p>
<h3>絲綢前市疾升　後市報疲</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况，猛烈上升，市上銀根承前日午後鬆勢，昨日週轉仍鬆，暗息回低至五角半六角，業內銀根甚鬆，引起買風。</p>
<p>120號有光新貨晨開一三五萬元，開後隔昨浮多了售，納胃甚滯，市勢微見盤檔，嗣後圈外黃金疾升，棉紗走勢尤勁，人心大好，抬面不斷哄托，塲上進意濃厚，喊價飛揚，叩一四〇萬中間左右盤旋，脚地甚堅。迨至臨收，聞黃金低後再升，頭寸供後不絕，買風再起，行情繼續盤高，高見　一四八萬，最後聞當局今起將大量拋售物資，銀根恐將抽緊，人心略軟，漲勢稍减，終以一四七萬收市。午後銀根微俏，暗息回升，圈外黃金高開低收，市勢未見好轉，喊價回小五·六萬元。</p>
<p>生絲昨日以外匯證又見悄升，圈外黃金疾進，更因頭寸鬆濫，人心高昻，市勢鋒悄。優級另担晨起做價在二〇〇萬高盤賣出，開後，各帮頗多觀望，人心平淡，趨勢微軟。嗣後外匯證高開低收，市呈盤局，近午圈外黃金低後再升，游資潛力仍挺，本街帮先起扒吸，喊價好起十萬元，高後業外各物齊步狂升，業內比比多單，供求鬆動，市勢再見盤升，近午高至一一八萬，D級78勻度二二〇萬，升勢頗鉅。午後圈外黃金多頭貼息再被壓低，銀根轉俏，市上暗息七十五元有求，散多不斷吐售，行情轉入疲檔，而疲後買氣轉滯，人心極軟，喊價低落十五萬元，一度小至二〇三萬二〇五萬元。</p>
<p>綢緞昨市承隔昨銀根鬆勢，開盤後卽見上升，嗣後金價狂竄，人心轉挺，均上買氣股渥，午收一致軋升。美亞被面初以八八萬喊做，開後買氣甚旺，一度高至九三萬九四萬，嗣後華股走勢疲軟，黃金高後轉低，業內游資外流，塲上脫意瞬息轉濃，市况一度回瀉，低盤於八九萬關邊。小後抬面逢低力進，更聞棉紗升勢奔騰，黃金終見回升，市勢重悄，，終以九二萬午收。</p>
<h3>出國旅客携帶外幣　以美金五百元為限</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關昨公吿：奉財部令規定，所有出國旅客携帶外幣，應以總値不超過美金五百元為限。其前往香港澳門者，以總値不超過美金一百元爲限，逾限依法沒收。</p>
<h3>外銷茶猛升</h3>
<p>查屯綠等外銷箱茶，自到存趨枯後，潛勢本屬堅靜，而昨市更因法國經濟團，來滬採購華茶之消息，甚囂塵上，兼又以金融性各物與業外商品，一致飛黃騰達，致人心愈益亢奮，執戶喊價頗若脫韁野馬，一路直向前奔，是以交易雖乏，市氣則再猛晋。至於內銷茶，亦因吐納談判僵持，成交奇狹，而漲風跟隨蔓延。</p>
<h3>出口貨申請結匯　上週折減約四成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會昨發表上週（二月廿七日至三月五日）上海一埠出口貨物申請結匯金額，較上週折减約達四成之數。全部數字折美金一，六六一，九二一·〇一元，其中包括政府自行結匯出口物資美金四七八，一八三·八三元。結匯商品共十七種，仍以棉紗居首，計二四四，二二四·〇八元。次爲布疋，計二三三，九五九·九三元。三爲雜貨，計二一五，三九七·九三元。</p>
<h3>桐油軋升</h3>
<p>桐油昨市，漲風連綿不休，緣因繼承隔日雖漲未足之潛伏力，同時又受黃金美鈔以及塲外各物狂騰之刺激，故人心奇挺，貨方喊價疾進，大有跟隨看齊之概，惟迄乍後，突聞央行拋售大量棉紗，俾資抽緊銀根，各方心思稍形平和，昻勢驟戢，而與上日相較，軋升尙多。</p>
<h3>肥料千五百噸　昨自比運抵滬</h3>
<p>經合總署之硫酸鉀肥料一千五百噸「由米立斯寇克」號輪昨已自比利時運抵滬。此項肥料將由「平興」輪轉運至汕頭。按經合署運華之肥料，至此已達六千三百噸。</p>

<h3>英軍龍頭踢得一塲精彩足球　塲脆爽辣大路作風　結果三比二龍頭獲得小勝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英海軍倫敦號足球隊，前遍戰和鐵路隊後，昨日二度出馬，與本市勁旅龍頭會師，英海軍以新陣容上塲，依然是一派乾脆爽辣的作風，而龍頭則後衛前鋒添了二員大將，前有高秀淸，後有吳祺祥，參加客串，攻守實力，大爲增厚，勢均力敵的打了九十分鐘，龍頭以三比二小勝，上半時一比一未分勝負。高秀淸獨中三球，風頭出足。可惜如此一塲精彩足球，祗有千餘人在逸園座上觀賞。足球委負會擬在星期五及星期六再替英海軍排兩塲比賽，可能對手爲靑白及羣力志超精武的聯隊。昨日雙方排出陣勢如下：</p>
<p>龍頭隊</p>
<p>高維辰</p>
<p>鄭秉彝　吳祺祥</p>
<p>吳凱敏　王寳山　史大法</p>
<p>王步榮　姜琨　高秀清　陳勤　張金根</p>
<p>英海軍</p>
<p>寨德邁</p>
<p>台特萊　費史東</p>
<p>格拉位　麥塞斯　荷萊脫</p>
<p>潘爾遜　地倫特　列能　倍蒂　葛利芬</p>
<p>比賽四時開始，龍頭全部「東星」制服登塲，裁判員何春暉鳴笛動員，雙方都是大刀闊斧的球路，爽快異常，英軍開球，卽遭阻回，球在中塲來去，高秀淸搭住深入，近門一叩，未曾中的。海軍右翼葛利芬活躍非凡，帶球傳中，列能一頂而未中。王寳山遠球猛射，敵門險落。地倫特直衝龍門，倍蒂遲到一步，空門竟未得中。英軍攻勢，相當猛烈。麥塞斯踢任意球，來勢猛烈，幸高維辰一托，救成角球，險極。吳祺祥滿塲飛奔，爲後防之功臣。龍頭前鋒在高秀淸率領下，小派司聯絡，相當純熟，頗能利用兩翼，左右開弓，向英軍門前勾送，惜中間三鋒，每未能扣住，徒成畫餅，良機一失再失。相持至二十分鐘，陳勤得球送中，小高搭住猛衝，一蹴而中，打開紀錄。龍頭再接再厲，攻勢頻頻，惜都無結果。十分鐘後，英軍亦來攻門，葛利芬右路深入，底綫勾中，地倫特迎頭一頂，高維辰跳起接球，球未抱住，將球向地下拍落，可惜已在白綫之內，判作英軍勝球，上半時各一平分秋色。</p>
<p>休息再戰，十分鐘內，毫無發展，球勢顯得沉悶，忽見陳動遠球一脚，高送門前，英軍後衛過度衝出，挽救不及，高秀淸脚起球落，應聲入網，二比一龍頭居先。英軍反攻，時見吳祺祥解圍。再十分鐘，張全根自右路侵入，台特萊急阻，回傳門將，不料高秀淸自旁竄上一脚，又吿中的上二比一龍頭已勝利在握。英軍高任遠球進攻，缺少控制默契，皆心勞力絀，五分鐘後，英軍終於在亂軍中，左翼潘爾遜頂中，奪回一球。最後，英軍在開角球後，銀笛長鳴，宣吿終塲。大夏萬里定今日複賽</p>
<h3>民主盃中級組　螢光得決賽權</h3>
<p>大夏萬里定今日複賽</p>
<p>螢光足球隊昨在南市球塲以一比零力挫滬警，奪得民主盃中級組決賽權。此球於開賽僅五分鐘時，螢光陶廷富在滬警球門之右前方三十礪開任意球，於洽興候個正着，頭頂入網，此後未有勝負，滬警卽以此寂寞之一球，不幸被淘汰出局。</p>
<p>民主盃中級組另一塲複賽，大夏對萬里，於今日下午四時舉行，裁判陳福寳，巡邊臧文彬方榮富，大夏實力强勁，奪標呼聲最高，但萬里球員多數爲南市聯賽冠軍新仙林隊之舊部，久經沙塲，或能使學生軍低頭。雙方陣容如下：</p>
<p>萬里</p>
<p>朱新章</p>
<p>龍國樑　兪永興</p>
<p>竺文寶　徐德順　張文龍</p>
<p>夏厚祺　戎正明　胡金成　王洪謀　林季榮</p>
<p>生力軍竺文輝嚴仁寬林季昌</p>
<p>大夏</p>
<p>沈延冠</p>
<p>邵光銘　陳福來</p>
<p>黃曾修　郁黎申　季滬生</p>
<p>葉秉元　楊庭堅　龐美雄　陳一飛　金錫祺</p>
<p>生力軍葉秉龍周家駰祝家佑胡志緩</p>
<h3>運動世界　今晚籃球甲組三塲　回力再戰恩卡斯　番兵番將麥令斯初逢培斐爾</h3>
<p>四屆籃球聯賽，今日甲組三塲，除首塲甲二Ｃ組培爾對鐵聯外。餘兩仗均爲甲一組第二循環戰，麥令斯對培斐爾，尙屬初逢。第一循環中因事改期，尙未補賽也。另幕則爲回力再戰恩卡斯，門票照舊，三百六百及九百三種。秩序及裁判名單如下：</p>
<p>培爾——鐵聯（甲二C）五時半裁判狄憲章王亦樵</p>
<p>麥令斯——培斐爾（甲一組）六時半裁判陶勃林基劉荷生</p>
<p>恩卡斯——回力（甲一組）七時半裁判陳寳琳黃存瑞</p>
<p>首仗培爾與鐵聯對壘，前者在本市籃壇已具相當歷史，麾下除胡家將外，如俞爾稼沈被章等亦久列戎行，惟以疏於練習，近况未見甚佳，本屆兩度出戰，擊敗胖隊，而受挫於平平。鐵聯係鐵路員工組成，長力充沛鬥志甚盛，屆時兩隊相逢，必有鏖戰。</p>
<p>麥令斯與培斐爾兩路番軍，初度交手，麥隊諸將個個熊腰猿臂，攻守方法純熟，第一循環中塲地生疏關係，常遭敗北，殊爲不幸，以球藝而論，其潛力固在今晚演出，當更有進步。至於培斐爾在第一循環中屢戰屢北，然第二循環初戰再遇盟主華聯，竟以四四比四三一分之差爆出冷門，獲得勝利，堪稱黑馬一匹，屆時兩個番軍互爭短長，未知孰勝孰負。</p>
<p>壓軸戰回力再戰恩卡斯，按兩隊初逢，回力曾以四七比卅八擊退恩隊，該隊田曹王三將均係好手，剽悍善戰，復得陳正淼葉雲山等助陣，軍容益見完整，惟恩卡斯爲滬上西人隊中歷史最久實力最强之隊，却利勃脫奧柴遼等狡猾異常，格朋乞谷夫陶勃林基投籃均具把握，而新人泊透球藝尤爲超人，雖貝格尼離滬未能出塲，實力仍未可輕侮，今晚寃家狹路，芷擬一伸宿仇，回力當愼防之也。六路人馬名單如下：</p>
<p>（培爾）俞爾稼，馬正倫，胡惠充，沈被章，胡惠凱，吳良軍，胡惠昭，胡惠繁，吳詩鑑，王爲公。</p>
<p>（鐵聯）董君楊，胡同怡，朱汝桂，招政治，王坤勝，張民權，樊悅平，孫立培，張其昌。</p>
<p>（麥令斯）利斯，歐恩蓋，哥芬斯，萊姆山，蔡勞特，朋克司東，華而夫，恩斯維泰，喬克生，歐納斯，古地，勃拉受。</p>
<p>（培斐爾）克勒，蒙托耶，勃朗，慕惠，格萊奇，鐵勃司，恩徒和，伊卡特，派克司，華全司</p>
<p>（恩卡斯）凱捷密洛夫，却利勃脫，格朋乞谷夫，工格朋乞谷夫，奧柴遼，茀閘克，貝格尼，沙司金，邱區胡，陶勃林基，泊透。</p>
<p>（回力）田福海，曹志吉，王永芳，魏啓現，王存忠，陳正淼，葉雲山，張浦，徐叔沅。</p>
<h3>今日籃球友賽　回力出戰大同</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今日下午二時，友誼籃球賽一塲，回力與大同大學在體育館交鋒，華聯健將樂嘉洲亦爲大同隊員，可有精彩表演。</p>
<h3>中山體專校友聯歡</h3>
<p>中山體專在滬校友爲研討體育服務工作，切磋心得起見，定三月十二日（星期六）下午六時假福州路六百十八號得意老聚興叙餐，敎師校友均得携眷友參加，以資聯歡，不另通知。</p>
<h3>菲國際四百公尺之賽泳　肥仔南名列第四　港菲華僑計劃舉辦埠際隊賽</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕代表香港單人匹馬出席全菲體協會主辦國際游泳大賽之陳震南，六日晚八時，在黎剎泅泳池作第二次之出師，比賽的項目，係四百公尺自由式。</p>
<p>「肥南」於第一晚千五百公尺長距離泳賽中，因各地名手雲集，肥南力戰祗能爭得第五名，雖未致落後太遠，僅獲兩分；惟照陳震南的實力而論：他氣力充長，而速度尙欠，故一般人咸認爲肥南底千五百公長的長距離，實較他的四百公尺中距離泳賽爲較有把握，從而對他底希望發生了動搖。</p>
<p>但是當陳震南於瀕行之前，在劉式文私寓裏的歡送宴會中，陳的敎練黃少池少雄兄弟，早就授給他一個錦囊，那就是：在菲作賽時，必定要排衆而前，爭先前導，尤其是在四百公尺較短途程中，而免再蹈去年港菲埠際賽的，給人家「搶頭」過多，其後雖能奮力猛追，但仍落後。所以，昨晚陳在黎剎紀念游泳池裏，四百公尺決賽中，槍聲一饗，陳震南爭先搶頭，與賽九個運動員中，陳在第三四名之間，而較當年埠際泳賽八百八十碼的冠軍爲略勝。</p>
<p>此賽一共係泅八個塘，途中彼此均有劇烈的爭持，震南雙臂撥水够力，唯雙足略沉，是爲美中不足。三百公尺以後，被馬巴士及另一菲世運選手超出，但陳仍能勝於其他三數選手以一個身位，並超出最後的一個泳員凡十礪之遙，最後一個塘時，陳居第四，以迄終點。首名爲一菲律賓的世運選手，馬巴士第二名，陳則列第四名，比首晚之千五百公尺公績，已進一步了。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕肥仔陳震南已於八日返港，據談此次赴菲，一因久失練習，二因該處天氣太熱，所游又爲淡水池，浮力不大，致未能到達預期水準，有負重負，深以爲歉。按陳參加一千五公尺，名列第五，成績大槪在廿三分左右。第一二三四名俱爲菲人，第一名成績爲廿一分卅五秒七。四百公尺陳列第四，成績約在五分三四十秒間，（陳之是項最高紀錄爲五分十六秒）此次是項第一名成續爲五分十八秒。</p>
<p>陳又語記者，此次赴菲，港方華人游泳界曾託其與菲方華僑接洽舉辦港菲華僑埠際游泳賽，深得菲僑同意，如成事實，則本年七八月間，香港或有菲港華僑游泳對抗可　。</p>
<h3>奧林匹克委員會　德國被邀請參加</h3>
<p>〔路透社弗萊克福八日電〕據弗萊來克福新聞報稱：下月在羅馬舉行之國際奧林匹克委員會全體委員大會，德國代表已接獲請柬，被邀參加。此請柬係送與瑪根堡公爵者，瑪氏曾任國際奧林匹克委員會委員爲時甚久，去年亦曾任倫敦參加大會。（按國際奧林匹克委員會此舉，不啻爲邀請德國參加下屆世運之先聲。）</p>
<h3>華爾考特將出馬　自信可奪拳王位</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社費城八日電〕美拳擊家華爾考特在喬路易放棄其世界重量級拳擊冠軍以後，今日首次接見新聞記者時宣稱：「予將爲下屆世界重量級拳擊冠軍，殊有自信」。按華爾考特今夏將與查理比賽競爭此一世界拳擊冠軍之榮座，渠今年三十四歲，渠曾爲對於爭取此一榮譽，兩度被喬路易擊敗。今夏之比賽，將爲其第三次出馬。</p>

<h3>從銀元想起</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>倘銀元的流通，始於光緒，那麼它在中國至少已混了六七十年；不料六七十年以後，幣制一再改革的結果，仍然是重新借重了銀元。足見中國之事，變來革去，無非是九九歸原。</p>
<p>廿四年法幣問世，和卅七年「金券」出籠，都與銀洋作對，但結果都被銀元吃憋。</p>
<p>「八一九」大改革，政府一面以「含金」之券廣收銀元，一面則嚴刑峻法，禁止流通或持有。這一下，確是銀元的末日。</p>
<p>然而，曾幾何時，銀元終又東山再起。民間父老和大小各「頭」，久別重逢，陪覺親切，人們無不慶幸「銀元寃獄」之得吿平反。也正因如此，便激起了泛濫全國的「銀洋潮」。被捲入漩渦者，有工人，農民，士兵，學生，公敎人員等等。</p>
<p>這些故事，描摹了中國現實經濟的悲劇，也說明一項眞理：在中國，凡是根深蒂固的事物，都不易一舉而剷除乾淨。</p>
<p>銀元交易是別開生面的：旣偷偷摸摸，又堂堂皇皇。這內幕，個個都知，無庸辭費。</p>
<p>銀元，忽而禁，忽而放。政府曾以存兌方式源源兌出，却又說不許買賣，意欲令人民把銀元當大餅啃；旣說嚴禁買賣，而又讓它進進出出。</p>
<p>法令在中國，是怎麼回事呢？不難從銀元中領略了。</p>
<p>現在，銀元買賣，在財金新案的「庇護」下，已百分之百地合法了。</p>
<p>因此河南路的銀牛不再以寗波路爲界，而放步向南，地盤擴充到南京路。可噹的節奏，比往日更急速而强烈，「大小頭買進賣出」的呼聲，較以前更嘹亮而有力。</p>
<p>預吿：不久，這音樂，卽可在公共汽車，電車，公共娛樂塲所，公開演奏。</p>
<p>大概爲了河南路交通太不成體統吧，當局聽說已準備設立銀元市塲。是則，將來投機生意，將不再限於金鈔大戶，小市民們也大可到銀市中去買空賣空一番了。</p>
<p>銀元，在新方案中，眞可謂名不正，言不順：旣把它估爲計算薪餉的標準，又規定金元劵是唯一的本位幣；旣準備日造六十萬枚銀元，又不許市塲以銀元計價；旣准許銀元流通，聲稱金融改革，穩定物價，又同時四種大鈔齊步出籠。</p>
<p>我看：新方案的任務，不過是把半公開的銀元投機交易，變爲公開，合法；把黃牛的「職業」予以保障。動亂的社會，便又多了一筆養育寄生份子的負担而已。</p>
<p>今年奇事果然很多，但沒有一件事比當局之處理銀元更有趣的了。</p>
<h3>無賴·阿Q·和面子</h3>
<p>— 司夷</p>
<p>我和妻，幾年來兩個人間最容易引起爭論的，就是在生活上無法避免的「無賴，阿Q，面子」這六個字，時常爲此辯到面紅耳赤。</p>
<p>在她以爲，並且儘量的履行到；「一個人生活在天底下，必須要有面子。雖然面子是盧僞的，一錢不値的，可是我們要竭力攫住它，原因是做一個人連面子都不顧，那就是典型的無賴了」。</p>
<p>直到現在，我因爲體貼她這份「面子」的苦心，於是把血汗換來的收入的一部分，支付了「實在不必要」的額外付出。譬如我現在的庽所所用的自來水，是由電馬達從自流井打出來的，一個月的電費，按巷內每棟住宅計算，每個住宅又再按戶籍計算。於是我以一個大小四口之家。却負担了和一家大小十口以上的人家相同數字。</p>
<p>當然，我始終憤憤不平。有許多次，我是提議改變這個繳納的辦法，妻却習慣地搬出一套簡單的邏輯來。</p>
<p>她說：「假如你提議改變，在你原是想公允，但是人家會說你是因爲繳納不起。接着會以無賴訾你。有面子的人，決不甘心做無賴的。你就把這份不平等的支出，當做救濟什麼善莊就算了」。</p>
<p>我說「講到最後，你露出了阿Q的原形。像我們這種人，須要他人救濟我們還來不及，遑論救濟他人？」？</p>
<p>於是，就又這樣爭論起來。她說來說去還是在「爲了面子」，而我却弄得啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>阿Q生前就是爲了「面子」，很費一番苦心。可是蓋棺論定，阿Q的面子非特沒有「彪炳千秋」，却最後還是落得個「無賴」下塲。我所最感到大惑不解的，就是除了拙荊以外，全國竟有這麼許多「怕做無賴」「拼爭面子」的英雄豪傑，追踪阿Q遺志，整天的在「繼續努力」。由此讓眞正無理無賴的人，明目張胆，在光天化日之下，若無其事。</p>
<h3>錢鈔古今談</h3>
<p>— 許達三</p>
<p>幣輕物重，古今皆然。今日商店售貨，若干以銀元標價，不過購物付以銀元，仍須照金圓劵折算。良以用慣金圓劵，計算反覺便利。我國歷史上用鈔之始，始自唐之「飛錢」，其實「飛錢」尙有今日的匯票性質。宋之「交子」「會子」，金之「交鈔」，才是眞正的紙幣。元朝一代，始終都用紙幣。朱明興起，又在南京鼓鑄銅錢用世，時有司責民出銅，民毀器皿輸官，頗以爲苦。而商賈買元之舊習用鈔，覺用錢反不便，於是給了明太祖機會。大明賓鈔，天下通行，偽造者斬，吿發的人賞銀二十五兩，仍給犯人財產。駐外軍士月鹽給鈔，各鹽塲給工本鈔，公務人員祿米也給鈔，鈔二貫五百文準米一石·其實江南一帶，人民重錢輕鈔，鈔錢一貫（千文），只換得銅錢一百六十文。終洪武年間，大明寳鈔已膨脹了六倍有餘·</p>
<p>明成視卽位後，更申交易用金銀之禁，犯者就要充軍。時陝西都司僉事張豫坐抵易官鈔論戍。江夏一小民，死了父親以銀營葬具，照例也要充軍。總算因逼於治葬，並非犯法，獲得成祖的寬免。足見前些日子金銀黃牛捉去只關幾天，還不算嚴重。</p>
<p>明代鈔票發多了，也踏上惡性膨脹的道路。實德初年，米一石用鈔五十貫，較洪武年間的祿米折價，已漲了二十倍。當時明室也曾想法使鈔票回籠，如「計口納鈔食鹽」和「稅糧課程臟罰俱收鈔」等。而且也曾拋售物資，如一令鹽官納舊鈔支鹽，發南京抽分塲積薪，龍江堤舉司竹木，鷺之軍民，以收其鈔」。到英宗憲宗時，鈔票更多，鈔一貫已不能値一文，民間交易，索性以米麥銀錢計算，英宗乃開用銀之禁。惟折官俸仍舊用鈔，眞是公務員的死路一條。憲宗時，乃不得不令內外課錢鈔兼收，官俸軍餉亦兼支錢鈔。時鈔一貫雖不値一文，而鈔徵之民，則每貫要徵銀二分五釐，其官價之高可見。足見鈔票發多了，發鈔的人也不得不予拒用，今日海關公用事業要用關元，公務俸給搭發銀元等措施，都是抄用陳法，古已有之，原不足爲怪。</p>
<h3>「穩定」與「公允」</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>市府爲謀「穩定」公用事業的價格，及求市民負擔的「公允」，便決定了「公用事業計算單位」，而且早已付之實行了。</p>
<p>這一來，公用事業的價格眞的「穩定」了，因爲從此公用事業不再有請求調整價格的麻煩，當局也沒有討價還價的麻煩，公用事業更沒有領導漲價嫌疑的麻煩。一舉三得，眞的聰明透頂，透頂聰明。然而市民的負擔，是否眞公允呢？</p>
<p>單從負擔上說，可以說是旣公且允的。因爲你消耗多少水電，乘坐多少距離的公共汽車和電車，任何人便該付同等的代價。（雖說穿制服的，或佩戴什麼證章的，依然不管這一套，但這是少數的特殊市民，該例外。）而這代價又是異常「公允」的，其數目的高低是依關元的上下，而關元的上下，則又根據外匯云云。</p>
<p>可是一加思索，便有點不「公」不「允」了。因爲所謂負擔，淺顯地說，便是支出，而支出則又是和收入對比的。我們雖不必和猶太人般的錙銖計較，但最低限度也要做到收入可以應付支出，卽使勉强一點，也不打緊。如果是永遠地入不敷出，就很難說了。</p>
<p>然而我們一般市民的收入如何呢？工廠商店是根據指數發薪的（指數的根據是金圓劵不是關元），公務人員是照七十五倍發薪的，可是他們今日的支出，却不得不依照所謂「公允」的「公用事業計算單位」計算。這一算，可眞把他們算得精光了。</p>
<p>當然，在此「國難」時期，人民固有吃一點苦頭的義務。但也要吃得心甘情願，而且也要吃得下去。如果吃苦頭的只是一般無權無力的小市民，而大官吏，大企業家，大資本家不與焉，那豈是表面的「公允」所能掩沒得住的！</p>
<p>或曰：難道這一次經當局縝密研究之下的「公用事業計算單位」，又吿「失敗」了嗎？應之曰：否。不過當局只把這計劃做了一半。因爲他們把全副精神着重在「穩定」上，不知不覺便忽略了「公允」了。而這種只做一半的大計劃，却又往往是小市民頂頭痛的。如此而已！</p>

<h3>Please Request He Yingqin and Gu Mengyu to Form a New Cabinet; Acting President Li is Actively Urging; Gan Jiehou and Qiu Changwei Pass Through Shanghai to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Acting President Li's intended candidates for the new premier have not yet been in Nanjing, so the work of seeking their consent will have to be delayed for a day or two before a decision can be made. It is said that there were important consultations at the official residence of Acting President Li Hougang on the evenings of the 8th and 9th, and long-distance telephone calls between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou were also frequent. As of the evening of the 9th, according to reliable information obtained, Acting President Li still intends to invite Mr. He Yingqin to form a cabinet, while Mr. Gu Mengyu is the second candidate. Sources close to Acting President Li revealed on the evening of the 9th that, given the seriousness of the current situation, the candidates for the new cabinet must be able to satisfy all parties. If He and Gu are nominated, they will surely receive support from both the government and the public. The most ideal situation would be for both of them to join the cabinet, either with He Yingqin as premier and Gu Mengyu as vice premier and concurrently minister of education, or with Gu Mengyu as premier and He Yingqin as vice premier and concurrently minister of national defense. If such a combination could be achieved, it would be a blessing for the country. Gan Jiehou and Qiu Changwei are going to Shanghai and Hangzhou respectively to persuade them to take on the task. According to our reporter's reliable sources, He Yingqin and Gu Mengyu have already agreed, but both have attached conditions, hoping to have the actual power of a responsible cabinet and the freedom to decide on all cabinet members. It is generally believed that these conditions are not insurmountable. Acting President Li is considering them, and if there are no problems, the new cabinet is expected to appear with a brand-new and strong lineup.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch of the 9th] Acting President Li is satisfied with He Yingqin's willingness to form a new cabinet and has expressed this intention to He. He has also consulted with He twice via long-distance telephone from Nanjing on the matter of forming a cabinet. However, it is still difficult to know whether Mr. He has already accepted the appointment. It is generally believed that Mr. He is still in the midst of considering it. He arrived in Hangzhou on the 8th with his wife and son and is currently residing in Tang Enbo's residence on the inner West Lake. This morning, he took a walk along the lakeside with his son, and in the afternoon, he took a boat to tour the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and the Lake Heart Pavilion in West Lake, appearing relaxed and carefree. Provincial Chairman Zhou Shu accompanied him on the tour. Although Acting President Li's special plane and representative Qiu Changwei have already arrived in Hangzhou to welcome him, there is no sign that Mr. He will immediately go to Nanjing to form a cabinet. Mr. He's birthday is on the 12th, and it is possible that he will still follow his original plan to avoid celebrating his birthday in Hangzhou before going to Nanjing. It is also said that he may go to Xikou within the next few days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Youth Party leader Li Huang is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th. Mr. Li flew to Shanghai from Chengdu on the 8th. This trip to Nanjing is at the invitation of Acting President Li to offer his opinions on the current state of affairs. It is reported that the new cabinet lineup will still invite friendly parties to assist in cooperation.</p>
<p>[News Dispatch] Gan Jiehou arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with a mandate from Nanjing to persuade He Yingqin and Gu Mengyu to form a new cabinet. After visiting relevant figures in the morning, he immediately traveled to Hangzhou in the same car as Qiu Changwei to convey Acting President Li's intentions to He Yingqin. Mr. Gan visited Yan Cheqing yesterday morning to discuss peace talks and also touched upon the matter of forming a cabinet. It is reported that Mr. Gan expressed that after the formation of the cabinet is completed, the peace movement can be expected to make new progress, because the problem with the government in the past was the inconsistency of opinions on the current situation. In the future, the will will be concentrated, and peace talks will be carried out with all efforts. It is learned that Qiu Changwei visited Gu Mengyu in Shanghai and had a long conversation with him. According to insiders, it is very likely that Mr. He will form a cabinet, because after the resignation of the Weng cabinet last autumn, the authorities originally intended to rely on him. At that time, Mr. He proposed two plans for political and economic reform and disarmament. The latter planned to reduce the national army by three million people to save treasury expenditures. This opinion was not accepted at the time, so Mr. He expressed no intention to form a cabinet. It is reported that Acting President Li expressed his full agreement with these two plans, so it is highly likely that Mr. He will form a cabinet.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Newspapers here believe that Acting President Li is determined to have General He Yingqin form a cabinet, with Shao Xiong as his deputy. It is heard that Mr. He strongly advocates using the policies of the British Labour Party as a blueprint to implement socialism in China, while at the same time strengthening the power of local organizations, so that after the Communist Party controls the coalition government, the Kuomintang can still maintain some influence in the localities.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Others to Return to Guangzhou Immediately to Handle the Closing and Handover Matters</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] After the Sun cabinet's collective resignation was approved, Premier Sun, in order to expedite the handover, has decided to return to Guangzhou within the next few days with Vice Premier Wu Tiecheng and the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, to discuss the political affairs of handling the closing and handover matters. It has also been decided to hold a political conference in Guangzhou within the next few days. This conference will be the last conference of the Sun cabinet, so Sun, Wu, and others must rush back to preside over it. The heads of various ministries and commissions currently in Nanjing, including Hong Lanyou, Zhong Tianxin, Xu Kan, Liu Weizhi, Pang Songzhou, Wu Shangying, Guan Jiyu, and Chen Xueping, will all return to Guangzhou within a day or two to expedite the handover. The reason why the handover must be handled in Guangzhou is that the seal of the Executive Yuan is now in Guangzhou, and the official documents, files, and dossiers of various ministries and commissions have all been moved to Guangzhou. After handling the handover, Premier Sun will return to his hometown of Hanmen to visit his elderly mother. It is expected that Sun will stay in Hong Kong for a short period of time to recuperate. Executive Yuan Secretary-General Duanmu Kai, Minister of Water Resources Zhong Tianxin, and Acting Minister of Communications Ling Hongxun took the night train to Shanghai on the 9th to wait for a flight back to Guangzhou to expedite the handover. At 4 p.m. on the 9th, Premier Sun invited Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Weng Wenhao, Xu Kan, and others to a meeting at the Executive Yuan's No. 1 official residence to discuss issues such as reducing military spending and verifying military expenses, which lasted for about an hour before adjourning.</p>
<h3>Central Organs in Guangzhou Have Not Yet Received Orders to Move North</h3>
<p>[United Press Guangzhou Dispatch of the 9th] Officials, both Chinese and foreign, here today all believe that Premier Sun Ke's resignation does not mean that the National Government will immediately return to Nanjing. According to some embassy staff, it is expected that they will remain in Guangzhou for at least two more months. Whether or not to return to Nanjing will largely depend on the success or failure of the peace talks.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy stated that there are currently no plans to recall the American diplomatic personnel who accompanied the Executive Yuan to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[Reuters Guangzhou Dispatch of the 9th] The Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan recently denied rumors circulating domestically that orders have already been issued for government agencies to move back to Nanjing from Guangzhou. He said that any decision on this matter must wait until the new premier of the Executive Yuan is appointed before it can be made. He personally believes that the central organs in Guangzhou may not move back to Nanjing, firstly because Nanjing is not safe, and secondly because many of the original sites of the organs in Nanjing are occupied by the military, and it is impossible to vacate them in a short time.</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Arrives in Nanjing; Chen Cheng and Others to Arrive Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Acting President Li invited military and political leaders from various parts of the Southeast to Nanjing to solicit their opinions on the state of the nation. Chen Jitang, Administrative Chief of Hainan Island, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 9th in response to the call and immediately met with Acting President Li in the morning for a long talk. Taiwan Chairman Chen Cheng has not yet departed due to administrative meetings. Acting President Li specially dispatched a special plane to meet him on the 9th, and it is expected that Mr. Chen will come to Nanjing within a day or two. As for Fujian Chairman Zhu Shaoliang, Guangdong Chairman Xue Yue, and Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters Director Yu Hanmou, there is still no definite date for their arrival in Nanjing. Mr. Chen Jitang flew to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 8th, accompanied by Lin Yizhong, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters. When Chen and Lin arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 9th, Bai Chongxi, Li Hanhun, Li Yuqing, and others were all at the station to welcome them.</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch of the 9th] Acting President Li sent a telegram inviting Chen Cheng to Nanjing. Mr. Chen should be able to make the trip within two or three days.</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch of the 9th] According to information obtained here, Acting President Li sent a telegram to Ma Hongkui, guaranteeing that he would come to Nanjing for a meeting before the 17th. Mr. Ma will fly directly from Ningxia to Nanjing in the near future. The special plane to welcome Mr. Ma will arrive in Ningxia in a day or two. In addition, Mr. Ma's diabetes has not improved. After attending a certain meeting in Nanjing, he will go to Shanghai and Hong Kong for treatment.</p>
<h3>The Drafting Committee for Political Reform Proposals Holds Its First Meeting in the Legislative Yuan; Believes That Administrative Organs Should Be Substantially Streamlined and Merged</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] The Drafting Committee for Political Reform Proposals of the Legislative Yuan held its first meeting at 9 a.m. on the 9th. More than 40 members attended. Chairman Zou Shuwen presided over the meeting. The members spoke one after another, discussing various aspects of the current political system and personnel policies. They all advocated that the Legislative Yuan, as an organ of power, should also be an organ of decision-making. If the rule of law is to be implemented, the functions of the Legislative Yuan must be exercised. Administrative organs are too redundant and complex, and should be substantially streamlined and merged, redundant personnel should be eliminated, the employment security of civil servants should be determined, the functions of various organs should be clearly defined, local power should be increased, and the central government should not interfere in everything. Some people also advocated sending several legislators to Xikou to meet with President Chiang to discuss the matter. No conclusion was reached by 12 noon, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 9 a.m. on the 10th to discuss it further.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] The Drafting Committee for Peace Proposals of the Legislative Yuan held its first meeting at 9 a.m. on the 9th. More than 30 members attended, with Huang Yuren as chairman. It was suggested to hold a closed meeting, so all reporters were barred from the door. The discussion was lively, and many people spoke. They all believed that peace was a pressing need for the people, and the Legislative Yuan should strive for peace that is beneficial to the people. It was decided to appoint Jiang Yiping, Yang Yuqing, Lu Yuwen, Zhang Yiwen, and Huang Yuren to be responsible for drafting a statement of opinions, with Huang Yuren as the writer. The five-member group will hold a meeting at 10 a.m. on the 10th to study it, and then discuss it at the second meeting of the Drafting Committee at 3 p.m. on the 10th before reporting it to the general assembly. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Draft of the Peace Talks Plan Completed; Willing to Make the Greatest Sacrifice to Alleviate People's Hardships; Particularly Emphasizes the Future International Status</h3>
<p>Sun Ke Convenes a Ten-Member Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] The preliminary opinions on the government's peace talks plan were finally discussed and summarized by the ten-member drafting committee convened by Sun Ke on the morning of the 9th. The initial draft of the record of these opinions was submitted to Acting President Li on the afternoon of the 9th. In addition to the counterproposals based on the CCP's eight conditions, which have been repeatedly reported in previous dispatches, according to well-informed sources, it also includes some new opinions that cannot be summarized within the CCP's eight conditions. Most of these opinions are of a diplomatic nature, that is, what kind of status China will have internationally after the establishment of the future coalition government. Referring to precedents, the opinions specifically point out that it should maintain its independence and must not be a dependency of any country. As for some specific issues in the CCP's eight conditions, when the members of the government's drafting of the peace plan exchanged opinions, they were willing to make the greatest sacrifices and concessions for anything that would help to realize true and lasting peace, in order to end the years of turmoil and alleviate the suffering of the people. The ten-member drafting committee convened by Sun Ke on the 9th was held at the Executive Yuan's No. 1 official residence at 10 a.m. Those who attended included Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Zhong Tianxin, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Fei, and others. They conducted a detailed review of the preliminary opinions on the peace plan. At the same time, because Sun, Wu, Zhong, and others will go to Guangzhou to expedite the handover and cannot continue to draft a formal plan, it was decided to first submit it to Acting President Li, and then wait for He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, and others to return before Acting President Li decides whether to add additional drafting members or discuss it again.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A certain peace representative returned to Shanghai from Nanjing and spoke at length about the current situation, saying that as of this time, the opinions on peace talks within the Kuomintang have not yet been unified. The collective resignation of the Sun cabinet is regrettable in terms of the overall situation and peace talks, because if the Sun cabinet did not resign, it could at least share the worries of the acting president. Today, he must bear the heavy burden alone. As far as peace talks are concerned, everything must wait until the cabinet is formed and the representatives are officially produced before they can proceed. The timing may be slightly later than expected. As far as I know, the CCP's lineup for peace talks has long been internally decided, so whether or not the peace talks can be held at an early date depends on the government. In recent days, the communist army has been deploying troops north of the Yangtze River with a strong intention to fight, but I personally believe that the purpose is to put on a show of force to create a psychological effect and prevent them from crossing the river suddenly. Otherwise, the impact on the CCP's credibility would be too great. In the consultations in Beiping, the communist side only pointed out that it is acceptable to take the eight points as a prerequisite for negotiations or as a basis for negotiations. I have not heard of any requirement to control Nanjing and Shanghai as a prerequisite for peace talks. I personally believe that the core issue of peace talks is not here.</p>
<h3>Ministry of National Defense Appoints Li Zhuoyuan as Commander of the Humen Fortress</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou Dispatch of the 9th] According to Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, the Ministry of National Defense has recently appointed Li Zhuoyuan as Commander of the Humen Fortress.</p>
<h3>Mao Zedong Has Not Arrived in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Associated Press This City Dispatch] According to news from Beiping, it was once rumored in late February that CCP Chairman Mao Zedong had arrived in Beiping, but Mr. Mao has definitely not arrived in Beiping yet. As of now, the highest-ranking figure of the CCP in Beiping is Peng Dehuai, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army.</p>
<h3>National Army in Shaanxi Recovers Fuping; Red Spear Society in Southern Henan Attacks and Enters Tongbai City; No Major Changes on the Northern Jiangsu Battlefield</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Xi'an Dispatch of the 9th] The Political Work Office of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters issued a battle report on the 9th: The National Army recovered Fuping at 10 a.m. on the 9th, and the communist army fled in confusion towards Pucheng and Yaoxian.</p>
<p>[Our Xinyang Dispatch of the 9th] Reliable information: More than 70,000 members of the Red Spear Society, spontaneously organized by the people of Southern Henan, are launching large-scale attacks on local communists in the border area between Henan and Hubei due to the communist army's forced conscription of military rations. According to news this afternoon, more than 10,000 members of the Red Spear Society attacked and entered Tongbai County (within Henan Province) at 9 a.m. this morning and seized more than 100,000 catties of communist army rations, more than 4,000 rifles, more than 40 submachine guns, more than 17 light machine guns, and more than 200 pistols in Caodian and other places.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 9th] There are no major changes on the Northern Jiangsu battlefield. The communist army naturally has its own necessary preparations for future crossing-the-river operations, and how the National Army can further consolidate the defenses of the Yangtze River is also an important issue. The recent Changzhou Pacification Conference convened under the chairmanship of Tang Enbo, as well as Tang's inspection of the river defenses, can all serve as footnotes to the above situation.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 9th] In order to prevent the communist army from crossing the river secretly, in addition to strengthening the bridgehead forces on the north bank of the Yangtze River, the Dagang area under Zhenjiang County was taken over by a certain unit of the National Army on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 9th] The 90th Division of the Fourth Army stationed in Zhenjiang is scheduled to conduct live-fire exercises with mortars and machine guns on the lawn of Die Wan Gao Yi at noon on the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 9th] It is rumored that the military has declared a blockade of the Yangtze River downstream. Our reporter specifically visited the army and navy authorities here to inquire about this. According to them, the so-called "blockade" only means that the military has imposed control over shipping between certain ports on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. All civilian ships or commercial ships can sail between ports permitted by the military and at designated times. Navigation up and down the river is not restricted by this ban. Military personnel also stated that the blockade of the Yangtze River will be decided based on the evolution of the military situation, and there is currently no need to take this measure.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Naval Headquarters reported: On the evening of the 7th, a small group of communist troops attempted to move near the Longwo area bridgehead, 200 meters north of the downstream ports of the Yangtze River. The invading communist troops were repelled by our joint army and navy cooperation. Communist troops in the Tianxingqiao area southwest of Taixing have been extremely busy building fortifications for days, which were completely destroyed by heavy artillery fire from the navy.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] A telephone call from Zhenjiang stated that 3,000 communist troops attacked Yizheng City on the north bank of the Yangtze River under the cover of artillery fire on the night of the 8th. By the morning of the 9th, they had been repelled, with approximately 400 communist casualties. Military personnel declined to disclose the exact situation in Guazhou on the north bank.</p>
<h3>Ted Tun Arrives in Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch of the 9th] The newly appointed Shandong Chairman and Qingdao Mayor Zhai Decun arrived in Qingdao from Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation plane on the 9th. His entourage included only the Director of the Provincial Government Information Office, Yin Dianjia, and an aide-de-camp. Liu Anqi, Gong Xuesui, Lin Yifang, and senior personnel from the Pacification Zone and the Municipal Government, as well as 200 representatives from all walks of life, welcomed him at the airport.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch of the 9th] It is rumored that the current Commander of the Eleventh Pacification Zone, Liu Anqi, will be transferred to the position of Deputy Commander of the Taiwan Provincial Garrison.</p>
<h3>Gong Debai Resumes Writing Commentary</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Gong Debai, the chief writer of the Jiuguo Daily, has been released and resumed writing commentary as usual on the 9th. The newspaper has been republished after being suspended for three days.</p>
<p>[Associated Press New York Dispatch of the 8th] The New York Herald Tribune editorialized on the 8th, stating: "The editor of the Nanjing Jiuguo Daily, Xi Debai, was banned from writing commentary. His courage in expressing this in Kuomintang territory only resulted in a short imprisonment. If he had expressed the same barbarity in the Communist Party area and suggested that Mao Zedong go abroad, the consequences would have been much more serious. The Chinese National Government's record on freedom of speech is not perfect, but it is better than the Communist Party's. It is doubtful whether Western government theories can take root in China when most Chinese people do not have enough food to survive."</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan to Continue Discussing the Proposal to Stop Conscription and Levy of Grain Today; The Proposal to Simplify Administrative Organs is Also on the Agenda</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] The fourth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9 a.m. on the 11th. The agenda will still follow the old example and be arranged by the Program Committee. However, if Acting President Li can propose candidates for the premiership of the Executive Yuan at that time, the agenda will be changed to vote on their approval. On the agenda for the 11th, the report items include a letter from the Secretariat of the Control Yuan informing that the annual meeting of the Yuan for the 38th year of the Republic is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on March 12th. In addition to continuing to discuss the proposal by Huang Tong and 33 others to quickly stop conscription and levy of grain, the only new item listed is the proposal by Chen Guyuan and others to simplify administrative organs and first amend Article 3 of the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Chen Guyuan and Others Propose to Retain Eleven Ministries</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Amidst the reorganization of the Executive Yuan and the government's preparation to streamline institutions, legislator Chen Guyuan and 46 others recently proposed "In order to simplify administrative organs, first amend Article 3 of the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan," advocating that the original 18 ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan be simplified to 11 ministries and commissions. The rest should be merged into other ministries and commissions or change their organization and be subordinate to the Executive Yuan or other ministries and commissions. The proposal argues that the following 11 ministries and commissions should be retained: (1) Ministry of the Interior, (2) Ministry of Foreign Affairs, (3) Ministry of National Defense, (4) Ministry of Finance, (5) Ministry of Education, (6) Ministry of Judicial Administration, (7) Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (intended to be merged with the farmland irrigation business of the Ministry of Water Resources, so it exists), (8) Ministry of Industry and Commerce (without intending to incorporate the business of the Resources Committee, and with the existence of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there is no need to restore the name of the Ministry of Economy or the Ministry of Industry), (9) Ministry of Communications, (10) Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission (related to border administration, so it exists), (11) Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (related to overseas Chinese, so it exists). The seven ministries and commissions that should be reorganized and merged are: (1) Ministry of Social Affairs (for labor business, a labor bureau should be established under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and the remaining business should be merged with the Department of Rites and Customs of the Ministry of the Interior and renamed the Department of Social Affairs), (2) Ministry of Water Resources (should be merged into relevant institutions according to the nature of its business, such as the farmland irrigation part being transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the transportation water conservancy part being transferred to the Ministry of Communications, etc.), (3) Ministry of Land Administration (should be renamed the Land Administration Bureau, depending on the complexity of its business, it should be directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan or directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior), (4) Ministry of Health (should be renamed the Health Department under the Ministry of the Interior), (5) Ministry of Food (related to the policy of conscription and borrowing in kind, since conscription and borrowing have been stopped, the remaining business of conscription in kind does not need to be a ministry. It should be renamed the Land Tax Department and transferred to the Ministry of Finance, and the business that cannot be transferred should be handled by relevant agencies), (6) Resources Committee (should remain its name and be directly under the Executive Yuan, so as to avoid being affected by political tides), (7) Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (is a purely business agency, and the chief officer does not need to participate in the decision-making of political affairs. It should be renamed the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and its status should be the same as the News Bureau directly under the Executive Yuan, and there is no need to stipulate it in the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan).</p>
<h3>American Reporter Visits Xikou; Stays for Two Days Without Seeing Special Precautions; According to Those Contacted, President Chiang Has Left the Political Circle</h3>
<p>[Associated Press China Branch President Gao Erya Xikou Dispatch of the 8th] Sun Ke's resignation on the 8th was not a surprising event for the few people in the village of Huanshan here who were once officials of President Chiang. People who have close contact with the president, although they said that Sun Ke's resignation had been expected for a long time, were unwilling to comment on the impact on the peace movement. The people this reporter contacted in Xikou in the past two days all unanimously declared that President Chiang had ordered them to take the same position as when they left Nanjing with him on January 22, that is, they had left the Chinese political circle. But informally, these people—about half the number of people who accompanied Chiang to Xikou—agreed that Sun Ke's Executive Yuan had many areas that needed improvement in the peace movement, which was the reason why Chiang resigned as president. President Chiang himself is practically completely separated from formal contact with the outside world. He rarely receives guests and requires senior officials with important matters. Zhang Zhizhong, the government's peace representative and possible successor to Sun Ke, was the most recent visitor, who went to Xikou on the 6th. President Chiang now has only two personal attendants—an aide-de-camp and a secretary—who handle all his affairs. One of them, in response to an Associated Press question about whether Chiang was still involved in politics and military affairs, said, "How can he? Only using a secretary"? He also flatly denied the rumors that Chiang was still issuing orders. Chiang does not spend his time in contemplation and meditation. He goes out for walks almost every day. One person said, "He makes our legs sore. He climbs mountains and floats in the river on bamboo rafts. He takes hiking trips and makes us go with him." There are few signs of special military precautions here. This reporter was not stopped once on the 35-mile trip from Ningbo to Xikou. Chiang has about 20 guards in total, and there are no signs of regular troops stationed.</p>
<h3>Discussions with Tao Xisheng at Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our Guangzhou Bureau, 8th] Tao Xisheng, Deputy Minister of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, stated during a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters on the 8th, in response to inquiries: After President Chiang's retirement, he would support Vice President Li as a private citizen and had no intention of resuming his post. Whether there would be peace or war in the future would be decided by Acting President Li and the responsible cabinet. He currently resides at Xizhai, acting entirely as a common citizen. The Constitution stipulates that citizens have freedom of residence, religion, assembly, association, speech, and publication. Kuomintang members also have the freedom to accept the leadership of President Chiang. However, this does not constitute interference in politics. The National Revolutionary Army of China has been led by President Chiang for over twenty years. His concern for the lives of soldiers is only natural. However, since he no longer holds the presidential office, all military matters are commanded by Acting President Li and the Chief of Staff. The Kuomintang has long handed over the army to the state. The current forces are national armies, not party armies, and President Chiang has no power to command them. He also stated that he believed President Chiang would not come to Guangzhou, Beijing, or Taiwan recently, and all rumors to the contrary were malicious fabrications. He further mentioned that President Chiang's past political measures might not all have been correct, but his contributions to the country from the Northern Expedition to the victory in the War of Resistance should be remembered. Apart from the Communist Party, no one could deny his contributions to the country. When a reporter asked why some orders issued by Acting President Li after taking office, such as the release of Zhang Xueliang, could not be smoothly implemented, he replied: According to the Constitution, the President has the power, and the Cabinet has the responsibility. Orders issued by President Chiang in the past had to be approved by the Executive Yuan before being promulgated by the President. However, Acting President Li's statement and orders on January 24th had not been fully communicated with the Executive Yuan, leading to some misunderstandings. Furthermore, Acting President Li's statement that he accepted Mao Zedong's eight conditions in principle has caused some people to suspect that he will seek peace or surrender. Regarding the peace talks, he stated that it depended on whether the Communist Party was truly sincere. The National Army is currently only in a defensive position. The progress of the peace talks would still be decided in Nanjing, and he predicted that the process might take a very long time. Finally, in response to a question about whether the Kuomintang would be reorganized internally, he said that most comrades hoped for effective reform.</p>

<h3>Editorial: New Shanghai Rent Standards</h3>
<p>To ensure the fairness and rationality of the new rent standards being drafted, the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau convened a meeting on the 8th of this month, gathering representatives from the Tenants' Union, the Real Estate Trade Association, and relevant industrial and commercial authorities to exchange views on the new rent standards. It is reported that the consultation resulted in the adoption of two principles: (1) The new standards will be based on Article 97 of the Land Law; (2) Rents will be calculated based on the cost of living index published twice a month, but the base will be discounted heavily compared to pre-war levels, and repair costs will be borne by the tenants. At the same time, all parties hoped that the new standards would be flexible, avoiding rigid regulations and striving to reduce disputes. The Land Administration Bureau is now revising the draft new rent standards based on the above opinions, and it is expected to be completed in the shortest possible time. Once reviewed by the Municipal Council and submitted to the Municipal Assembly for discussion, it can be finalized.</p>
<p>The abnormal panic regarding housing in Shanghai has affected both tenants and the real estate industry, leading to a unanimous demand for reasonable adjustments. The Land Administration Bureau is drafting new rent standards to meet the demands of all parties and to reasonably resolve the abnormal housing shortage, which is not only necessary but also a very good intention. What is worth discussing now is whether the new standards are reasonable and whether they can break through the abnormal housing shortage.</p>
<p>The urban housing shortage is a serious phenomenon that occurred after the war, and it concerns the housing problem of the people. This is not unique to Shanghai, nor is it unique to Chinese cities. After the war, governments in various countries fulfilled their responsibilities in legislation and administration to solve the housing problem for the people and society. American cities were not bombed, but men and women got married during the war. Once demobilized, husbands returned home and hoped to have a new home, so a housing shortage occurred in the United States. Congress paid attention to it, the government cared about it, and they used their power to solve it. Now the United States has no serious housing shortage. In Moscow, Ukraine, and Belarus, the people were displaced during the war. The Soviet government quickly paid attention to it, and before completing the disarmament of the German army, they built new houses on the ruins. The Soviet people today have no worries about a shortage of housing. Britain did not build houses during the war, and the dilapidated ones could not be repaired, and the destroyed ones were waiting to be demolished. As a result, London experienced a serious housing shortage after the war. However, since the Labor Party came to power, it has regarded the people's housing problem as being as important and urgent as the nationalization bill. Therefore, in the year since the Labor Party came to power, it has passed three major bills in Congress, making planned construction and encouraging private construction. Local governments have also established rent arbitration tribunals under the "Rent Restriction" bill, resolving many rental disputes. Even in Japan, a defeated country, the bombed areas of Tokyo have been rebuilt, and the construction of the ruins of Hiroshima is progressing even faster. Foreign reporters who went to Hiroshima to visit were very surprised by the Japanese spirit of reconstruction. As mentioned above, regardless of whether a country won or lost the war, the governments of other countries have done something about the people's housing problem. Only the situation in China is an exception. Not only are most people displaced and homeless, but even the cities with the most houses have an abnormal housing shortage, and the situation in Shanghai is the most serious.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Shanghai housing shortage is completely abnormal. According to some statistical analysis, Shanghai has a population of six million. If there is a reasonable method of allocating housing and a reasonable guarantee of rent, everyone should have suitable housing. Today, the owners who hold real estate in Shanghai have very little income, which directly prevents their legal property from being protected, and indirectly makes no individual or company willing to invest in building houses in the future. On the other hand, truly law-abiding tenants cannot legally obtain reasonable housing leases. Among these two, only "second landlords" can manipulate everything, obtaining gold, foreign exchange, or rice from rent leases, thus creating an unprecedented housing shortage. Market speculators are unwilling to invest in real estate. Although the real estate industry had a moment of prosperity and trading at the beginning of the issuance of gold yuan coupons, it quickly lost interest, which is completely different from the situation before the war. The enemy and puppet houses that were taken over are occupied by powerful people. No one has ever interfered with this dark and unclear phenomenon. It is said that even today, there are still people illegally occupying houses, not paying the purchase price, not paying rent, and using them openly. This unreasonable phenomenon has been developing for more than three years, but has not been resolved. Real estate owners are asking the government to adjust rent standards according to the Land Law to obtain legal income; tenants are under the pressure of rent disputes, organized the Tenants' Union, and asked the government to restrict rent increases and protect their residential interests. The Land Administration Bureau, under the pressure of both sides, drafted a new draft rent standards for the sake of their duties, and is prepared to promulgate it immediately after all parties agree. This should be done, I am afraid that it cannot be delayed any longer!</p>
<p>To solve the urban housing shortage and adjust reasonable rental relationships, the National Government promulgated a "Housing Lease Ordinance" on December 1, 1947, which is a very good social legislation. If Shanghai can implement it administratively, Shanghai's abnormal housing shortage can indeed be eliminated. Unfortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Government does not attach much importance to it, and has no courage to implement it. The Shanghai Municipal Assembly also avoids touching on this troublesome issue amid a variety of opinions, so the 7,000-fold and 9,000-fold standards set in March last year are nominally suspended. The government and public opinion organs are really irresponsible! Now the two principles passed by the Land Administration Bureau, the first one is to set new standards based on Article 97 of the Land Law, that is, the rent should not exceed 10% of the annual interest of the total declared value of the land and its buildings, which will satisfy the owners of the Real Estate Trade Association, because their property income can be expected to be guaranteed. Secondly, the second one is to calculate the rent standard based on the cost of living index, and then give a very large discount, which is probably the opinion of the Tenants' Union. According to the Tenants' Union's suggestion, the new rent can be based on one yuan before the war converted into four or five cents, and then multiplied by the cost of living index. If this suggestion is adopted, the burden on tenants will not be too heavy. The opinions of the two sides seem to be able to be coordinated, but how to break through the intermediate substitution of houses, restrict the subletting of houses, so that everyone bears reasonable rent and legally and directly obtains the lease of houses, there is no decision, and it is still quite regrettable.</p>
<p>The housing shortage in Shanghai is indeed very serious and needs to be resolved thoroughly. No one opposes increasing rent and guaranteeing owners reasonable and legal income. Truly law-abiding tenants are also willing to abide by the contract. However, the creation of Shanghai's abnormal housing shortage today, which forces both owners and truly law-abiding tenants to suffer, is the illegal "second landlord" who specializes in subletting and replacing, and the group of people. If the "Housing Lease Ordinance" is not strictly implemented and subletting is banned, the bad wind of the housing shortage in Shanghai will still exist, and it will still be of no benefit to the people and society. The municipal authorities are urged to pay attention to this!</p>
<h3>The Pioneering "Land to the Tiller" Initiative: Longyan Completes Land Reform, the Entire County is Now Populated by Owner-Farmers, Begging and Theft Eliminated, Neighboring Six Counties Begin Similar Reforms</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th] Chiang Meng-lin, Chairman of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction (JCRR), told reporters on the 9th that the JCRR has decided to allocate funds to subsidize the implementation of land reform in Longyan and other seven counties in western Fujian. This is a pioneering initiative in our country to implement land reform and achieve "land to the tiller". Chiang believes that the achievements of Longyan County in implementing land reform and the experimental work in the nearby six counties are the correct path that our country should take for land reform in the future, and the JCRR is now fully assisting in the promotion of this experiment. Chiang stated, "This measure by the JCRR will have a profound impact on the transformation and stabilization of China's current social economy and order." According to Chiang, Longyan County is the only region south of the Yangtze River that has completed land reform, and its reform achievements have begun to become significant. Chiang continued, "According to the results of this survey by our committee, the improvement of farmers' lives and agricultural production in the area has reached 20% compared to the year before the reform. The entire county is now populated by owner-farmers, and begging and theft have been eliminated. This achievement has induced landlords in other adjacent areas to welcome reform. The 7th District Commissioner's Office has now started the same land reform in Yongding, Wuping, and Shanghang counties, which are adjacent to Longyan. The other three counties of Changting, Tanping, and Liancheng will be included in the second phase and completed within one year." The reporter also learned that the JCRR has decided that the scope of assistance will be: (1) To maintain and expand the effects of land reform after it has been completed, the committee will allocate funds to Longyan County farmers to increase agricultural production, promote land utilization, and strengthen the economic status of owner-farmers, because the farmers in this area are all self-cultivating, so the various benefits generated by the aforementioned assistance will not be shared by landlords and will all be enjoyed by farmers. (2) To subsidize the implementation of reform funds for the other six counties that are implementing land reform, so that the land reform plan can be effectively implemented and quickly completed. The completed areas can also be subsidized according to the Longyan method to improve their agricultural production. The committee firmly believes that the assistance given in this way will enable farmers to directly benefit without being wasted.</p>

They quickly informed the fire brigade to climb the pagoda for irrigation and rescue, which took an hour to extinguish. The loss was still small, and the cause of the fire was bizarre. For a time, there was a lot of discussion, all kinds of absurd and unreliable speculations. The police station has now summoned the temple monk Ye Chao to investigate the truth.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Fully Supports Southern Country's Demands Negotiations on the Austrian Treaty are on the Verge of Collapse The West Insists that Austria's Border Cannot Be Changed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 9th Radio: The Four Powers' Conference on the Austrian Treaty has entered its fifth week. Judging from the current situation, the negotiations are on the verge of collapse. The representatives have agreed to invite Bebler, the Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia, to attend the meeting again this Thursday to state his demands on Austria. If the Southern country still insists on demanding Austrian compensation and territorial concessions at that time, the meeting will inevitably fail.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union supports the Southern country's position, but the British and American laws have repeatedly stated that Austria's borders must not be changed. Today, the Soviet representative suggested organizing a working group to study the Austrian border issue, but it has been rejected by the three powers. The three powers then suggested setting up a working group to study other demands of the Southern country, but the case was overturned by the Soviet Union again. The Soviet representative, Charlypin, once again stated his support for the demands of the Southern country and asked the three powers to clearly express their opposition to border changes, which made the deadlock even more difficult to break. Western countries bluntly stated that if the Soviet Union cannot show a sincere intention to sign the treaty, then all negotiations are unlikely to succeed.</p>

In future wars, the Atlantic may be equal to the Mediterranean in the past, and the position of the British Isles will be similar to that of Malta.

<h3>Inside Story of the Mysterious Disappearance of China Airlines' Shanghai-Qingdao Flight Secret Mixing of Communist Personnel Forcing a Landing in Jinan Mid-flight The Pilots and Passengers Return to Shanghai Discussing the Detention Experience</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] On January 30th of this year, China Airlines' C-47 model XT-135 Shanghai-Qingdao flight mysteriously landed in Jinan, a communist area, en route to Qingdao. For more than a month, there has been no news. Unexpectedly, until yesterday, all three crew members of the plane, pilot He Xueke, co-pilot Shu Zhilun, and telegraph operator Wang Qingyuan, returned safely to Shanghai from Qingdao on the company's flight. The remaining passengers also arrived safely in Qingdao the night before, but the 135 plane has been retained by the communist side for their own use.</p>
<p>According to the crew members who returned to Shanghai, the reason why the plane flew to Jinan was that there were communist personnel mixed in the plane and they were forced to land. After taking off that day, at around 11 am, just as the co-pilot and radio operator were distributing food boxes to the passengers, about five or six passengers suddenly drew pistols, threatened and monitored them. They forcibly entered the cockpit, drove out the main pilot, and drove themselves, immediately changing course to fly to Jinan. When arriving over Jinan, the driving passenger tried to land twice without success. Fortunately, the weather was clear that day, so a disaster was avoided. Finally, the co-pilot was forced to return to the cockpit to land the plane.</p>
<p>After disembarking, all the crew members and the remaining passengers were concentrated in the municipal government guest house for residence. During this period, they were treated kindly, but were not allowed to talk to or contact the outside world. This lasted until the 5th of this month, when they were allowed to set off and return to Qingdao. The journey took four days, and they took trains, cars, bicycles, and wheelbarrows. After arriving in the Qingdao area the night before, they were sent to Qingdao by a vehicle dispatched by the local garrison. All the luggage and other items of them and the passengers were returned and brought back.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of material exchange across the Yangtze River, the industrial and commercial sectors are paying close attention as the prosperity of the country depends on it; however, there are many misunderstandings from all sides. Qian Chengxu of the Export Promotion Office of the National Goods Ten Factories, specifically issued a supplementary statement yesterday, elaborating on the progress of this matter, stating: Last lunar new year, merchants from various places in Xuzhou, Huai'an, and northern Jiangsu heard that postal, navigational, and commercial links with North China had been realized. They came to Shanghai indirectly, intending to follow the example of merchants from both sides obtaining permission from their respective authorities to exchange coal, soybeans, and cotton from their areas for cotton cloth and industrial products from Jinghu (Nanjing and Shanghai). At the time, the person in question informed the merchants to first return to their local areas and negotiate with the Communist side. At the same time, this idea was conveyed to the Wujin and Wuxi Chambers of Commerce for discussion. Wujin was willing to provide cloth in exchange for soybeans and cotton because it produced cloth that used to be sold to 22 counties in Xuzhou, Huai'an, and northern Jiangsu, but sales have completely stopped due to the war, while edible oil is urgently needed. Wuxi, because the exchange port is designated as Jingwang, which is separated from Jiangyin by a river and accessible by road, can also exchange yarn and cloth for cotton and coal. As for the Capital Electric Power Plant, it used to use Huaibei coal, requiring more than 5,000 tons per month, and after the mine changed hands, the coal source became scarce. It planned to obtain coal supplies at Yuxikou in Anhui, via the Jingwu Road. Various industries in Shanghai hope to open Nantong as an exchange station for convenience. In short, this issue is related to the people's livelihood and economy and is extremely urgent; however, its promotion is difficult in terms of technology, personnel, and economy. It requires joint efforts from industry and commerce and can only be successful with the final permission and ruling of the authorities. The issue of protection is particularly important. If safety is not guaranteed, merchants will definitely not risk such danger. As for the reports in various newspapers that the Export Office of the National Goods Ten Factories has sent special personnel to Xuzhou and Huai'an for negotiations, the Export Office is only a promotional organization for national goods and does not have the qualifications to represent industry and commerce. It is only because of the frequent contact with merchants from Xuzhou and Huai'an who come to Shanghai that the demands of the industrial and commercial sectors here are conveyed, hoping to proceed in stages to promote its success.</p>
<h3>Public Opinion Survey Committee Collects Public Opinion; Sends Personnel for Door-to-Door Interviews</h3>

<p>[Another Report] According to reports, when various neighborhood security units in the Xin'cheng District distributed the March rationed rice, they attached a self-defense donation of two liters of white rice per person. If citizens are unable to pay, their rice certificates are withheld. The Public Opinion Survey Committee has investigated and confirmed this matter, considering this measure to be contrary to the meaning of the rationing policy. The office has submitted letters to the Mayor and the Civil Affairs Bureau, requesting that they be ordered to stop this.</p>

<h3>Inability to Resolve Coal Shortage on Both Railways; Two Commuter Train Services Suspended; National Railway Passenger and Freight Rates Adjusted from 00:00 on the 11th</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] It has been learned from transportation circles that national railway passenger and freight rates will be adjusted simultaneously from 00:00 on the 11th of this month.

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The coal shortage at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau remains unresolved. The bureau's finances are still extremely tight, and it is fundamentally unable to purchase coal. The bureau chief, Wang Zhaohuai, went to Nanjing the other evening to request a solution from the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<p>Another Report: To save coal consumption, the railway bureau has decided to suspend the 77th and 79th Shanghai-Wuxi and Shanghai-Suzhou second and third-class commuter train services on the Shanghai-Nanjing line from today.</p>
<p>[Report from the East China News Agency] The coal shortage problem at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau has become the most serious stage. All coal reserves are only enough for three days, that is, until the 12th. If there is no other source after the 12th, all passenger and freight services on both railways will be completely suspended. According to the railway bureau, the monthly coal consumption for train operation was previously difficult to purchase due to tight finances. Fortunately, the Central Bank, the Four-Mine Joint Venture, and the Anthracite Coal Regulation Committee and other organizations assisted as much as possible to maintain it until now. However, coal prices have soared this month, and the railway bureau's total income is no longer sufficient to purchase coal. Therefore, if there is no thorough solution in the future, the operation of the two railways will be in question.</p>

<h3>Calculation Basis for Public Utilities; City Council Changes to Review Today; Agreed on Three Points Yesterday: First, Collect Cost Statistics</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the City Council's Public Utilities Subcommittee resolved to abolish the Guan Yuan calculation for public utilities and replace it with adjustments based on the cost of living index, the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the City Council convened the responsible persons of various public utility companies and the competent authorities of public utilities at the Public Utilities Bureau conference room yesterday to begin reviewing the base numbers for various units. However, due to time constraints and reference materials, it was not possible to review yesterday. Three preliminary resolutions were made as follows: (1) Each company is requested to compile statistics on the minimum required quantity of coal, fuel oil, materials, repair, and maintenance costs required each month. To avoid being affected by currency devaluation, permission is granted to settle in U.S. dollars and submit the information to the Public Utilities Bureau before 10:00 AM this morning so that the City Council representatives can immediately go to the Central Bank to request a loan according to the amount. At least half a month's cost fees must be loaned to compensate for the losses of each company due to this change in adjustment method. (2) Each company is requested to make an accurate comparison of the pre-war and post-war prices of each unit of water, electricity, etc., and provide detailed explanations, and submit them to the Public Utilities Bureau before 12:00 PM this morning for the basis of reviewing and determining the base price. (3) At 3:00 PM this afternoon, the City Council's Public Utilities Subcommittee will hold another meeting in the Public Utilities Bureau conference room to begin the work of reviewing and determining the base numbers.</p>
<p>Unanimous Opinion of Various Companies: Do Not Insist on Guan Yuan Calculation</p>

Chairman Jiang Haoran first reported that the City Council had already resolved to abolish the Guan Yuan calculation and explained the purpose of today's meeting, saying that each company could express their difficulties as much as possible. Then, the representatives of various companies stood up one after another to state their opinions. To summarize, their opinions were completely consistent, mostly expressing that they did not insist on the Guan Yuan calculation but believed that it was a more thorough method. They believe that subsidies or loans from the central government only increase procedures and that the result is still shared by the people. They also lamented the hardships, expressing that under the accelerated devaluation of the currency, the company's economy can no longer be maintained without reasonable adjustments. The new adjustment system was overturned by the City Council, and the adjustment based on the cost of living index has not yet been realized. During this transition period, the citizens are all adopting a wait-and-see attitude and delaying payment, and the public utility companies will collapse immediately. The representative of the U.S. Telephone Company even shouted, "My God, you can only run this company for me."</p>

Because the point of advance payment by users had been raised and rejected by the Public Utilities Subcommittee, it was not submitted for discussion yesterday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Orders Each Company to Submit Income and Expenditure Ledger</h3>

<h3>Financial Management Bureau Statement: Guan Yuan Is Not Currency</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the issue of public utilities being priced according to "Guan Yuan," the local financial management authorities made the following statement yesterday: In the recently promulgated financial and financial reform plan, the "Guan Yuan" item is only a unit of calculation for customs to collect import taxes and is not a currency that can circulate in the market. If general merchandise prices or labor service calculations are based on "Guan Yuan" as a standard, it is inconsistent with the original intent of the above-mentioned financial reform plan. The fact that public utilities use "Guan Yuan" as the pricing standard has been stopped by the Municipal Government, it is said.</p>
<h3>Changwei District Refugee Students Arrive in Shanghai from Qingdao to Transfer to Hunan; Lack of Travel Expenses and Difficult Living Conditions; Social Affairs Bureau Temporarily Grants Porridge for Four Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] More than two hundred middle school students, teachers, and family members from the Changwei District of Shandong Province fled to Qingdao around March last year. They spent half a year in Qingdao, struggling with difficult living conditions. Due to the limited number of publicly funded student places in Qingdao schools, they were unable to enroll. On the afternoon of the sixth of this month, they arrived in Shanghai on the Beiming Liner at 4:00 PM and temporarily resided in the Shandong Native Place Association on Zizhong Road. They slept on bedding in the classrooms of the Qilu Elementary and Middle School at night and wandered outside during the day when classes were in session. They originally planned to transfer to the Shandong Provincial United Middle School in Hengshan, Hunan, but their travel and living expenses were exhausted. The Shandong Provincial Government Office in Shanghai lacked funds and was unable to help. The person in charge of the Ministry of Education in Shanghai could not be found. After two days of efforts, there were no results. Yesterday morning, 175 refugee students went to the Social Affairs and Education Bureaus to petition. According to the Social Affairs Bureau, they could be sent to a shelter to solve their living problems, but the students felt that they were only staying in Shanghai for a few days and still wanted to go to Hunan to study, so they were unwilling to enter the shelter. The Social Affairs Bureau then decided to provide porridge for four days, until the 13th, two meals a day, and asked the student representatives to sign a pledge. In this way, their living expenses for a few days can be temporarily resolved, but the travel expenses to Hunan are still not secured. If they cannot leave by the 13th, the porridge will stop, and their lives will once again be in dire straits. Therefore, they especially appeal to various charitable organizations and philanthropists in this city for relief, so that they can enroll in school as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>The Far East Economic Fortress: HSBC Bank's Business Center Shifts from China to East Asia; New Transformation of British Merchants in the Current Situation</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Zijing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hong Kong Sixth Dispatch] The dynamics of Hong Kong merchants "doing business for business's sake" have been reported in the previous dispatch, but most of those words refer to Chinese merchants. What is the attitude of foreign merchants, especially British merchants? I believe that the general public in the country is also paying attention to it. The annual report of HSBC Bank, the largest British economic fortress in the Far East, was published yesterday. The words in this report can paint a picture of the current face of British merchants for us.</p>
<p>"Both sides of the conflict in China are determined to industrialize China in the shortest possible time as a means to alleviate the suffering of farmers. The necessary condition for this trend is to improve transportation, especially railways and inland river navigation systems. If the realization of this improvement is not to be prolonged, then machine tools and overseas investment are indispensable. Therefore, we should not neglect our position in China."</p>
<p>This is a passage from the report by HSBC Bank Chairman and General Manager Morse. He has peered through a country "that is falling into civil war, with a lax administrative system, a financial organization dominated by the military, and forced to abandon its attempts to maintain a balance of income and expenditure, relying on inflationary finances to maintain its daily needs," and seen a beautiful vista. He announced to British merchants, "In my humble opinion, all merchants engaged in foreign trade in China must prepare to deal with a completely new situation in the coming years, without any precedent, and adapt their ideas and actions to that new environment." Morse also affirmed that China must import consumer goods and machinery from foreign countries and export goods in exchange for imports. In other words, no matter what state China changes to, China must trade with foreign countries, and British merchants should tighten their grip on the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Don't just look at the distant scenery. Based on the fact that HSBC Bank issued an increase of more than HK$112 million in the past year and obtained a net profit of HK$16,792,000, with a dividend of £5 per share, British merchants will not easily give up the Chinese market that has been operating for more than a century. HSBC Bank is also the highest representative of British merchants in China.</p>
<p>However, Morse, looking at the overall situation in the Far East, had to admit that under the circumstances of inflation, the numbers are deceiving. Political disputes, foreign exchange controls, and other business restrictions have caused great resistance for British merchants. He pointed out a very important fact: HSBC Bank's business center has gradually shifted from China to Southeast Asia, and the importance of HSBC Bank's Singapore branch is now increasing day by day. While urging British merchants "not to neglect our position in China," Morse announced that the center of the largest British economic fortress in the Far East has been moved away from China. This change is worth noting.</p>
<p>Why should HSBC Bank's business center withdraw from China? Morse did not specify. He only lightly stated: "The outlook for the situation is unpredictable. Even looking at the world as a whole, the current unstable situation is more severe than any period in our memory. I feel that the future of China greatly depends on the changes in the world situation, especially the relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries."</p>
<p>We cannot help but marvel at the British foresight on this point, but according to the above, we cannot interpret this new change of HSBC Bank as a sign that British merchants are abandoning the Chinese market. Morse's report also listed the relationship between HSBC Bank and the development of Hong Kong in the past 20 years, which is also worth mentioning. He said: "Twenty years ago, Hong Kong had a population of only 800,000. Now it is almost 2 million. In those days, the Hong Kong government's annual revenue was about 23.5 million, but now it exceeds 150 million. In those days, HSBC Bank's balance sheet was 710 million, but now it is 2.665 billion. The banknotes issued in those days were less than 65 million, but at the end of December last year it was 728 million. Last year's current deposits exceeded 1 billion. From these figures, HSBC Bank and Hong Kong are inseparable. From the perspective of HSBC Bank, the position of Hong Kong in today's Chinese economy is also clear at a glance."</p>

<h3>Before the Formal Establishment of the Gold and Silver Market, the National Bank Expands the Scope of Distribution, Entrusting Banks, Bureaus, Trust Departments, and Silver Shops to Sell on Behalf</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, in response to the fluctuations in the market price of gold and banknotes, Mr. Liu, the president of the Central Bank, invited all relevant parties to discuss future gold and silver policies. As a result, the plan was not yet in a mature stage, and the news that was scheduled to be released after the meeting was temporarily suspended. Subsequently, Lin Chong, the director of the business bureau of the bank, told reporters that regarding the sale of gold, before the formal establishment of the open gold and silver market, the National Bank is considering expanding the scope of distribution to allow more institutions to sell gold on behalf of the National Bank. Entrusting silver shops is just a beginning. Regarding the disconnection between the National Bank's distribution price and the actual market price yesterday (i.e., the 9th), the National Bank will pay attention to it, and starting today (the 10th), it will take into account the actual situation and set a reasonable distribution price accordingly.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the National Bank will also entrust the trust departments of various national banks and bureaus to handle the sale of gold at the same time, in order to achieve universal supply.</p>
<p>Gold Prices Continue to Rise; Silver Shops are Crowded</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the gold market continued to rise sharply due to the influence of the war and the easing of credit. When the gold market approached the 300,000 mark, the listed price of gold jewelry in the city's silver shops still stood at 267,000 yuan per tael. Affected by this, all silver shops in the city were crowded yesterday morning, and they were overwhelmed. However, due to limited funds, silver shops had limited purchases from the National Bank, so most of the sales at the door were limited to one or two mace of thread rings. Those exceeding this number were mostly politely rejected by the tellers. Some silver shops on Nanjing Road announced that they were sold out before 11:00 AM. In the afternoon, most of them posted signs to stop sales. At this time, the market price of gold had already soared past 300,000. Wu Pengnian, the chairman of the industry association, and others felt that the silver shops were in a difficult situation in this wave of gold price fluctuations and could not maintain normal business. They went to visit Lin Chongyong, the director of the business bureau of the National Bank, at noon to express their difficulties in person.</p>
<p>To Suppress Gold Price Fluctuations, Silver Shops are Allowed to Sell on Behalf</p>
<p>The National Bank authorities decided to ask the Gold Management Bureau to allow the city's silver shops to accept the National Bank's entrustment to sell gold bars on behalf, in addition to the original business of gold jewelry, starting from today. The selling price is the National Bank's distribution price plus a 20% handling fee. In addition, they do not bear security donations, business tax, and other expenses. Therefore, the National Bank's distribution price yesterday was 250,000 yuan per tael, and the retail price of bars in various silver shops in the afternoon was 255,000 yuan per tael. The National Bank decided to entrust various silver shops to sell bars at the door at around 1:00 PM yesterday. Although the application for distribution and purchase from various silver shops was unlimited in name, the silver shops were limited by funds and had weak absorption capacity. As a result, only more than 90 shops applied for purchase, with a purchase amount of only more than 3,100 taels. The National Bank allocated all of them according to the application. The payment for the gold purchased was limited to cash, bank drafts, or checks to be paid to the National Bank before 4:00 PM yesterday. In the future, the business of various silver shops will be divided into two departments: bars and gold jewelry. Before opening at 10:00 AM, each silver shop will first consult with the National Bank authorities to inquire about the market conditions of the day, and then operate according to the listed price, while preparing to apply to the National Bank for purchase procedures.</p>
<h3>Although the Net Deficit of National Banks and Bureaus is Huge, the Trend of Monetary Easing Has Not Weakened; Today's Settlement is Quite Large, and the Trend May Tighten</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday's credit market initially showed a smooth overnight easing trend, but the daily interest rate still stood between five and six jiao. Later, due to the continued easing trend and the rumor that a huge amount of funds was allocated from a certain place and still remained in the market, the daily interest rate also gradually fell to four and a half to five and a half jiao. However, after 2:00 PM, the market suddenly heard that the money industry exchange had stopped accepting applications, and the credit market once turned bullish, but the daily interest rate still did not exceed six jiao. Later, it was confirmed that it was inaccurate, and the credit market turned to ease. Therefore, the fluctuations in the credit market for the whole day were limited, and the daily interest rate always hovered between five and six jiao. Although the net deficit of national banks and bureaus was 116.938 million yuan due to the sale of foreign exchange transfer certificates and the distribution of gold to the silver shops, the national treasury's expenditures were huge, and the credit market failed to tighten. The net deficit of other foreign merchants was 32.78 million yuan, the net surplus of large exchanges was 43.617 million yuan, and the net surplus of small exchanges was 106.101 million yuan. Today, there is a settlement of cotton yarn of about 1.1 billion yuan. If the National Bank sells gold or other materials in a timely manner and the national treasury has no special allocations, then today's credit market should turn tight and bullish.</p>
<h3>The Banking Association Sends a Circular to Members to Comply with the Check Clearing Time</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Banking Association believes that the sudden increase in the number of checks in circulation recently has had a significant impact on the clearing time. According to the original clearing time, the clearing start time is 2:00 PM, and it can be completed in about three quarters of an hour. The time limit for each bank to send checks is before 1:15 PM. The time limit for returning checks and making up the difference is before 8:00 PM. Recently, the delay has been too long. The time for sending checks often has to be extended to around 3:00 PM, so the clearing often has to be extended to 3:30 PM before it can start. The time for returning checks is often extended to around 10:00 PM in the evening. At this time of curfew, the check clearing house feels very inconvenient. Therefore, the Banking Association sent a circular to its members yesterday, urging them to comply with the check clearing time.</p>
<h3>A Large-Scale Massacre in Yuyao: Rioters Open Fire with Guns</h3>

<h3>After the Implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, Smuggling in South China Has Improved</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Zaying, the representative of the Central Bank stationed in Hong Kong, recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong to report on his work and request instructions on future work guidelines. In order to understand the recent financial trends in Hong Kong and the various situations after the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement, this reporter paid a special visit to Mr. Lin. According to him, since the official signing and implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, the most effective result has been the substantial elimination of the rampant smuggling activities in various parts of South China. All banks and firms in Hong Kong are also able to handle the exchange of Gold Yuan Certificates in accordance with our country's regulations. The only problem currently being more complex is the revival of the Shanghai foreign exchange market. Regarding this matter, Mr. Lin believes that on the one hand, it requires the cooperation of Hong Kong, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to first seek stability in the domestic economic situation.</p>
<h3>The Market Sentiment Is Depressed, and Chinese Stocks Lack the Strength to Rise</h3>
<p>Due to the depressed political situation, the Chinese stock market yesterday was strong at first but then weakened, showing a trend of lacking the strength to rise. Although the money supply has become looser, people's spirits are extremely low. Securities firms and major banking players are concentrating on scooping up gold, and even if they occasionally dabble in stocks, they immediately sell at high prices to realize profits. Retail investors are especially wary and dare not take action easily. Therefore, although off-exchange gold has risen, the stock market is becoming increasingly soft. Wing On Spinning opened at 5.535 yuan. Hearing that the Hong Kong exchange rate had narrowed, it was gradually pulled up, reaching a high of 5.63 yuan. Guangdong firms and No. 168 sold at high prices, and the market fell sharply again. At 11:30, the market within the exchange gradually became chaotic, and the bid-ask spread was as large as five cents. For a time, the market plummeted, with the lowest price at 5.533 yuan. Near the close, securities firms raised the price, and the market was slightly pulled up to close at 5.538 yuan. Mei Ya continued to decline, opening at 1.82 yuan, with a high of 1.87 yuan, a low of 1.67 yuan, and closing at 1.69 yuan.</p>
<p>Although off-exchange gold was reported to be rising sharply, breaking through the 300,000 yuan mark, the prices listed on the exchange were still sluggish, and trading did not improve much. The highest price was only 157,000 yuan, the lowest was 148,000 yuan, the highest in the afternoon was 180,000 yuan, and the closing price was 162,000 yuan, with a turnover of 248 taels, it is said.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Continue to Be Popular</p>
<p>Regarding the foreign stock market, due to the gradual easing of the money supply in the industry, the market continued to rise. Various firms were absorbing stocks, and retail investors were also scooping them up, so the market continued to be stable and strong. Ewo Cotton Mill traded at 10,500 yuan and 10,700 yuan, an increase of about 20% compared to the previous day. British American Tobacco continued its strong momentum, trading at 1,250 yuan and 1,350 yuan, an increase of 270 yuan compared to the previous day. Shanghai Brewery rose by 400 yuan, trading at 1,800 yuan and 1,900 yuan. Wheelock &amp; Co. set a new high of 31,000 yuan and 33,000 yuan. Other stocks also rose by 10% to 20%.</p>
<h3>National Bank's Small Factory Loans to Temporarily End Starting on the 19th</h3>
<p>Emergency Industrial Loans Will Continue to Be Processed</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Small Factory Loan Review Committee of the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee held its fourth review meeting yesterday. Yan Yaoqiu and others attended, and approved 1,910 small factory loan cases.</p>
<p>Since mid-January of this year, the National Bank, in order to help small factories in this city during the Lunar New Year period, has been providing small factory loans. To date, two months have passed, and more than 8,000 small factories have been approved for loans, accounting for more than 80% of the factories in this city.</p>
<p>Loans of about 500 million yuan have been issued, allowing various industries to weather the difficulties. Recently, there have been very few applicants. Yesterday, the committee decided that the small factory loan program would temporarily end on March 19. If there is a need in the future, it will be held again.</p>
<p>[Another report] The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee's emergency industrial loans will continue to be processed, and order financing will be launched soon to provide production funds, it is said.</p>
<h3>Coarse and Fine Yarn Rise Sharply Together, Cotton Cloth Advances Towards High Peaks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market surged, mainly because the applications for southbound transportation from various South China firms and colleagues have been largely approved, so the trading within the exchange was extremely active. In addition, financial and non-industry goods were all reported to be rising, and people's sentiments were unanimously geared towards higher prices. Holders were unwilling to sell, and buyers were vying to purchase, resulting in a situation of supply falling short of demand. As a result, the prices of various yarns rose by about 20% compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix yarn broke through the 2 million yuan mark as soon as it opened in the morning, reaching a new high of 2.02 million yuan, and was finally pushed up to 2.18 million yuan, a sharp increase of 400,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn soared by 240,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot yarn jumped from 1.07 million yuan to a high of 1.17 million yuan, eventually settling at 1.15 million yuan, a dramatic jump of 243,000 yuan. Factory orders for the afternoon were at 1.145 million yuan. 20-count yarn, except for Double Bee and Ru Yi brands, were all traded outside the 1 million yuan mark. 16-count Guangming yarn also approached 1 million yuan, at 970,000 yuan. The prices of other yarns generally reached new highs.</p>
<p>The cloth market saw a resurgence of price increases, mainly because the money supply in the market was gradually easing, and rumors spread that large denomination 1,000 yuan banknotes would be issued again, leading to a sudden boost in people's spirits. Guangdong firms absorbed large quantities, and local firms were also unwilling to sit idly by, actively buying when prices were low, causing market prices to jump sharply.</p>
<p>Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 38,800 yuan, once falling to a low of 37,800 yuan. Near the close, upon hearing that cotton yarn prices had risen, buying interest suddenly surged, and the price broke through the 40,000 yuan mark, ending at 40,500 yuan, a sharp increase of 6,700 yuan. Trumpet Child fine cloth was at 37,800 yuan, a sharp increase of 5,200 yuan compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji opened at 38,500 yuan, once falling to a low of 37,500 yuan midway, and then soared, eventually closing at 39,400 yuan, a surge of 6,500 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, colored cloths and printed cloths were all advancing towards new highs. In the afternoon, due to the rise in red gold, off-exchange asking prices were seen rising again. It was heard that Dragon Head fine cloth was at 45,000 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Yuan Ji was at 44,500 yuan, but eventually fell slightly.</p>
<h3>China Textile Corporation Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank yesterday resumed entrusting the China Textile Construction Corporation to sell yarn in the market, holding three sessions. As a result, a total of 920 pieces were sold to 169 approved buyers, with a value of 846.42 million yuan.</p>
<p>The details of each yarn sale are as follows: (1) A total of 395 pieces of 20-count Grade B cotton yarn were offered, priced at 960,000 yuan. 47 buyers applied for 127 pieces, which were allocated as requested.

<p>In addition, the Textile Construction Corporation still sold yarn to the reproduction industry as usual yesterday, offering ten types of yarn of various counts, selling a total of 213 pieces to 105 approved buyers, with a value of 377.73 million yuan. The selling prices of each yarn were as follows: 8-count Sunlight, 480,000 yuan; 10-count Li Ma, 570,000 yuan; 15-count Feng Nian, 920,000 yuan; 32-count Yang He, 1.35 million yuan; 32-count Double-strand Happy Crane, 1.9 million yuan; 40-count Red Treasure Light, 2 million yuan; 40-count TK Sunlight, 2.84 million yuan; 42-count Double-strand Li Ma, 2.05 million yuan; 60-count Palace Maiden, 2.9 million yuan; and 80-count Double-strand TK Color Ball, 5.8 million yuan.</p>
<h3>A Stroll in the Market: Onlookers and Spectators</h3>
<p>The rising tide has not yet fully taken root, and the intricate curtain has become quite complex. Interest rates and special offers fly together, backfiring and contributing to the situation.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market saw a sharp rise in prices, and the reasons are said to be very complex:</p>
<p>(1) The Hong Kong exchange rate shrank significantly. The night before last, it was 9.6 cents, but yesterday it opened at 8.8 cents. One Hong Kong dollar required 1,250 Gold Yuan, which, in the current circumstances, cannot but be astonishing.</p>
<p>(2) Premier Sun Yat-sen's resignation caused a great commotion in Guangzhou. It is said that the Hunan firms in Guangzhou sold 60 large boxes of large denomination banknotes to buy Hong Kong dollars, and then scooped up gold notes. In this city, the Guangdong firms were also very active, unanimously scooping up. This trend occurred before payday in the middle of the month, so although it cannot be said to be a true rising tide, the basic trend is indeed quite strong.</p>
<p>(3) Premier Sun Yat-sen announced in the Legislative Yuan that he was resigning, and also announced that the fiscal deficit for this year was more than 580 million US dollars. Some people say that this news is Premier Sun Yat-sen exposing the dirty laundry, but it is still the truth. With the truth revealed, how can people not be more enlightened?</p>
<p>(4) Every rumor, whether military or political, is beneficial, and this is also one of the key factors.</p>
<p>(5) The Central Bank's increase in the purchase price of foreign exchange transfer certificates proves that the Central Bank is really worried about the excess currency circulating outside, and cannot but think of ways to bring it back.</p>
<p>(6) Large denomination banknotes are flowing out in large quantities. For the sake of payday in the middle of the month, the new influx is one of the reasons for the rising tide, but it also meets the needs of the times.</p>
<p>(7) The more important real factor is interest rates. Although yesterday's increase was not small, the interest on funds dragged in on Monday was still insufficient. As the tide rises, so do the boats, this is an immutable truth.</p>
<p>Not to mention hidden interest, even if we calculate according to the listed interest rate of 50 yuan by money shops, if we use 10,000 yuan as capital to lend at the call loan rate, in five months, the principal and interest will become 1,192,448,000 yuan. This is such a terrible number. If call loans are like this, then commodity prices will naturally rise even more sharply.</p>
<p>Even so, the high interest rate policy has a hidden purpose for the authorities. Because when the rising tide comes, the authorities have no countermeasures, wouldn't that be embarrassing? With this strategy, they can beautify the past. That is, when the rising tide is fierce, they can sharply raise interest rates, temporarily diverting speculative funds. But even temporary effectiveness can show some ability, and can give some explanation to superiors and subordinates alike.</p>
<p>But there is a condition here: if the rising tide and interest rates rise gradually, then the authorities' plan can be realized. If the rising tide and interest rates rise at the same time, then adding fuel to the fire becomes superfluous.</p>
<h3>Affected by the Loose Money Supply, Rice Prices Jump Again, White Fine Rice Sells for as High as 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rice market saw another sharp jump yesterday, mainly due to the loose money supply. Furthermore, with gold prices rising beforehand, people's sentiments were strong, and asking prices rose significantly.

<h3>Silk Prices Rose Rapidly in the Morning, but Weakened in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's artificial silk market saw a sharp rise. The money supply in the market remained loose yesterday, continuing the trend of easing from the afternoon of the previous day. Hidden interest rates fell to 5.5 to 6 cents, and the money supply within the industry was very loose, triggering a buying spree.</p>
<p>120-count new raw silk opened at 1.35 million yuan. After opening, sales were slow due to more stock than the previous day, and the market showed a slight consolidation. Later, off-exchange gold rose rapidly, and cotton yarn prices were especially strong, boosting people's spirits greatly. Traders continued to push up prices, and buying interest in the market was strong. Asking prices soared, hovering around 1.4 million yuan, and the base was very firm. Towards the close, it was heard that gold had fallen and then risen again, and the supply of funds remained continuous. Buying interest rose again, and the market continued to rise, reaching a high of 1.48 million yuan. Finally, it was heard that the authorities would start selling materials in large quantities from today, and the money supply might tighten, causing people's sentiments to soften slightly and the rising momentum to weaken slightly, eventually closing at 1.47 million yuan. In the afternoon, the money supply was slightly tight, hidden interest rates rose, and off-exchange gold opened high and closed low. The market did not improve, and asking prices fell by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's raw silk market saw a quiet rise in foreign exchange certificates again. Off-exchange gold advanced rapidly, and the loose supply of funds and the bullish sentiment among people boosted the market. High-grade alternate reels were sold at a high price of 2 million yuan in the morning. After opening, various firms were mostly watching, and people's sentiments were flat, leading to a slightly softer trend. Later, foreign exchange certificates opened high and closed low, and the market entered a consolidation phase. Near noon, off-exchange gold fell and then rose again, and the potential of speculative funds remained strong. Local firms started scooping up first, and asking prices rose by 100,000 yuan. After reaching a high, various goods outside the industry rose sharply in unison, and there were many long orders within the industry. With supply and demand easing, the market saw another rise, reaching a high of 1.18 million yuan near noon. D-grade, 78 evenness, was at 2.2 million yuan, a significant increase. In the afternoon, multi-head interest rates on off-exchange gold were suppressed again, and the money supply tightened. Hidden interest rates in the market were at 75 yuan with demand. Many retail investors continued to sell, and the market turned into a weak consolidation phase. After weakening, buying interest became sluggish, and people's sentiments were extremely soft, with asking prices falling by 150,000 yuan, once falling to a low of 2.03 million to 2.05 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk market continued the loose money supply trend from the previous day, and saw an increase as soon as it opened. Later, gold prices soared, and people's sentiments turned bullish, all leading to strong buying interest. The afternoon close saw a general rise. Mei Ya damask was initially asked for at 880,000 yuan. After opening, buying interest was very strong, once reaching a high of 930,000 to 940,000 yuan. Later, Chinese stocks weakened, and gold turned lower after reaching a high. Speculative funds within the industry flowed out, and the intention to sell in the market instantly intensified, and the market once fell back to the edge of the 890,000 yuan mark. After a short while, traders actively bought on dips, and it was also heard that cotton yarn prices were soaring, and gold eventually rebounded, and the market regained its quiet strength, eventually closing at 920,000 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Carried by Outbound Travelers Is Limited to US$500</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Jianghai Customs announced yesterday: According to the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, all foreign currency carried by outbound travelers should be limited to a total value not exceeding US$500. For those traveling to Hong Kong and Macau, the total value should not exceed US$100. Any excess will be confiscated according to law.</p>
<h3>Export Tea Soars</h3>
<p>Export box teas such as Anhui green tea have been inherently stable and quiet since their stocks dwindled. Yesterday, the market was further boosted by rumors of a French economic delegation coming to Shanghai to purchase Chinese tea. In addition, financial and non-industry goods were all soaring, leading to increasingly high spirits among people. Holders' asking prices were like wild horses running without reins, rushing straight ahead. Therefore, although trading was lacking, the market sentiment rose sharply again. As for domestic tea, the stalemate in the digestion and absorption negotiations also led to extremely narrow transactions, and the rising tide spread along with it.</p>
<h3>Export Goods Applications for Foreign Exchange Settlement Decreased by About 40% Last Week</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Export Control Commission announced yesterday that the amount of applications for foreign exchange settlement for export goods in the Shanghai port last week (February 27 to March 5) decreased by about 40% compared to the previous week.

Third was miscellaneous goods, accounting for US$215,397.93.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>The tung oil market saw continuous price increases yesterday, stemming from the latent strength of the previous day's increase not being sufficient. At the same time, it was stimulated by the soaring prices of gold, US dollars, and various goods outside the exchange, leading to extremely high spirits among people. Sellers' asking prices rose rapidly, largely keeping pace with the others. However, after a short while, it was suddenly heard that the Central Bank was selling large quantities of cotton yarn to tighten the money supply, and everyone's thoughts became slightly calmer, and the rising momentum suddenly stopped. But compared to the previous day, there was still a sharp rise.</p>

<h3>The British Navy's London Team Played a Wonderful Football Match, with a Crisp, Clean, and Straightforward Style. The London Team Won a Narrow Victory with a Score of 3-2.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After tying with the Railway Team in previous battles, the British Navy's London football team took to the field for the second time yesterday, clashing with the local powerhouse Longtou. The British Navy fielded a new lineup, still maintaining its crisp, clean, and straightforward style. Longtou, on the other hand, added two generals to its defense and forward lines, with Gao Xiuqing in the front and Wu Qixiang in the back, participating as guest players, greatly enhancing its offensive and defensive strength. The two teams were evenly matched and played for 90 minutes, with Longtou winning a narrow victory of 3-2. Gao Xiuqing scored all three goals, stealing the show. It is a pity that such a wonderful football match was watched by only over a thousand people in the Yiyuan stands. The Football Committee plans to arrange two more matches for the British Navy on Friday and Saturday, with potential opponents being the combined team of Qingbai and Qunli Zhichao Jingwu. The lineups fielded by both sides yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Longtou Team</p>
<p>Gao Weichen</p>
<p>Zheng Bingyi Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Wu Kaimin Wang Baoshan Shi Dafa</p>
<p>Wang Burong Jiang Kun Gao Xiuqing Chen Qin Zhang Jingen</p>
<p>British Navy</p>
<p>Zaidmeier</p>
<p>Taitley Feaston</p>
<p>Gravel Messers Hollert</p>
<p>Parnell Dielent Lenon Beatty Griffin</p>
<p>The match started at 4 o'clock. Longtou entered the field in full "East Star" uniforms. Referee He Chunhui blew the whistle to start the match. Both sides adopted a bold and straightforward style of play, which was exceptionally refreshing. The British team kicked off, but was immediately intercepted. The ball went back and forth in midfield. Gao Xiuqing advanced and took a shot near the goal, but missed. The British Navy's right winger Griffin was exceptionally active, dribbling and crossing the ball. Lenon headed the ball, but missed. Wang Baoshan took a long shot, and the enemy's goal was in danger. Dielent charged straight at the goal, but Beatty was one step too late, and failed to score in the empty goal. The British team's offensive was quite fierce. Messers took a free kick, and the momentum was fierce. Fortunately, Gao Weichen deflected it, saving it as a corner kick, which was extremely dangerous. Wu Qixiang ran all over the field, contributing to the defense. Under the leadership of Gao Xiuqing, Longtou's forwards connected with small passes, which was quite skillful and could utilize both wings, attacking from both left and right, and sending the ball to the British goal. It was a pity that the three center forwards often failed to connect with the ball, making it a pie in the sky, and good opportunities were lost one after another. After a stalemate of 20 minutes, Chen Qin got the ball and sent it into the center. Xiao Gao (Gao Xiuqing) caught up and charged fiercely, scoring in one fell swoop, opening the scoring. Longtou continued its efforts and launched frequent offensives, but all without result. Ten minutes later, the British army also came to attack the goal. Griffin penetrated deep on the right, hooking the ball from the baseline. Dielent headed the ball, and Gao Weichen jumped up to catch the ball, but failed to hold it and patted the ball to the ground. Unfortunately, it was already inside the white line, and it was judged as a winning goal for the British army. The first half ended with each side drawing one goal.</p>
<p>After resting and fighting again, there was no development within ten minutes, and the ball situation appeared dull. Suddenly, Chen Dong took a long shot and sent it in front of the goal. The British army's defender rushed out too far and was unable to save it. Gao Xiuqing raised his foot and the ball fell, responding and entering the net. Longtou took the lead at two to one. The British army counterattacked, and Wu Qixiang was seen clearing the ball. Ten minutes later, Zhang Quangen invaded from the right, and Taitley hurriedly stopped him, passing the ball back to the goalkeeper. Unexpectedly, Gao Xiuqing rushed up from the side and scored again. Longtou had victory in hand at two to one. The British army launched a long-range attack, lacking control and coordination, and everyone was mentally and physically exhausted. Five minutes later, the British army finally headed the ball in from the left wing Parnell in the chaos, winning back a goal. Finally, after the British army took a corner kick, the silver whistle sounded for a long time, announcing the end of the match. Daxia Wanliding will have a rematch today.</p>
<h3>Yingguang Wins the Right to the Final of the Democracy Cup Intermediate Group</h3>
<p>Daxia Wanliding will have a rematch today</p>
<p>Yingguang Football Team defeated Shanghai Police 1-0 at the South City Stadium yesterday, winning the right to the final of the Democracy Cup Intermediate Group. In this match, only five minutes after the start, Yingguang Tao Tingfu took a free kick 30 steps to the right front of the Shanghai Police goal. Yu Qiaoxing caught the ball squarely and headed it into the net. After that, there was no win or loss. The Shanghai Police were unfortunately eliminated with this lonely goal.</p>
<p>Another rematch in the Intermediate Group of the Democracy Cup, Daxia vs. Wanli, will be held at 4 pm today. Referee Chen Fubao, linesmen Zang Wenbin Fang Rongfu. Daxia has strong strength and is the most popular to win the championship, but most of the Wanli players are old members of the Xin Xianlin team, the champion of the South City League. Having been on the battlefield for a long time, they may be able to make the student army bow their heads. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Wanli</p>
<p>Zhu Xinzhang</p>
<p>Long Guoliang Yu Yongxing</p>
<p>Zhu Wenbao Xu Deshun Zhang Wenlong</p>
<p>Xia Houqi Rong Zhengming Hu Jincheng Wang Hongmou Lin Jirong</p>

<h3>Sports World Tonight's Three Basketball Matches in Group A: Huili Re-Engages Encas; Foreign Soldiers and Generals of Macklin First Meet Pei Fei'er</h3>
<p>In the fourth basketball league, there will be three Group A matches today. Besides the first match between Pei'er and Tielian in Group C of Group A2, the remaining two matches are the second-round battles of Group A1. Macklin versus Pei Fei'er is their first encounter. The first-round match was postponed due to circumstances and has not yet been rescheduled. The other match is Huili re-engaging Encas. Ticket prices remain the same, with three types: 300, 600, and 900. The order and referee list are as follows:</p>
<p>Pei'er -- Tielian (Group C of Group A2) 5:30 PM Referees: Di Xianzhang, Wang Yiqiao</p>
<p>Macklin -- Pei Fei'er (Group A1) 6:30 PM Referees: Tao Bolinji, Liu Hesheng</p>
<p>Encas -- Huili (Group A1) 7:30 PM Referees: Chen Baolin, Huang Cunrui</p>
<p>In the opening match, Pei'er will compete against Tielian. The former has a considerable history in the local basketball scene. Besides the Hu family's generals, players like Yu Erjia and Shen Beizhang have also been in the ranks for a long time. However, due to a lack of practice, their recent performance has not been very good. In the current season, they have won against Pang Team twice but lost to Ping Ping. Tielian is composed of railway employees. They have abundant stamina and strong fighting spirit. When the two teams meet, there will definitely be a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Macklin and Pei Fei'er are two foreign armies having their first encounter. The players of Macklin are all burly and strong, with proficient offensive and defensive methods. In the first round, due to unfamiliarity with the venue, they often suffered defeats, which was unfortunate. In terms of skills, their potential lies in tonight's performance, and they should make further progress. As for Pei Fei'er, they repeatedly lost in the first round. However, in the first battle of the second round, they surprisingly defeated the league leader Hualian by a narrow margin of 44 to 43, becoming a dark horse. When the two foreign armies compete, it is unknown who will win.</p>
<p>The final match is Huili re-engaging Encas. In their first encounter, Huili defeated Encas with a score of 47 to 38. Tian, Cao, and Wang of Huili are all good players, brave and good at fighting. With the assistance of Chen Zhengmiao, Ye Yunshan, and others, the team's strength has become more complete. However, Encas is the oldest and strongest Western team in Shanghai. Players such as Queli Botuo, Ouchai Liao, etc., are cunning and abnormal. Ge Pengqigu Fu and Tao Bolinji are accurate in shooting, and the newcomer Bo Tou's skills are even more outstanding. Although Bei Geni is unable to play due to leaving Shanghai, their strength should not be underestimated. Tonight, when enemies meet on a narrow road, they intend to avenge their past grievances. Huili should be careful. The list of six teams is as follows:</p>
<p>(Pei'er) Yu Erjia, Ma Zhenglun, Hu Huichong, Shen Beizhang, Hu Huikai, Wu Liangjun, Hu Huizhao, Hu Huifan, Wu Shijian, Wang Weigong.</p>
<p>(Tielian) Dong Junyang, Hu Tongyi, Zhu Rugui, Zhao Zhengzhi, Wang Kunsheng, Zhang Minquan, Fan Yueping, Sun Lipei, Zhang Qichang.</p>
<p>(Macklin) Lis, O'Enge, Gefens, Laimushan, Cai Laote, Pengkesi Dong, Hua Erfu, Ensi Weitai, Qiaokesheng, O'Enasi, Gudi, Bola Shou.</p>
<p>(Pei Fei'er) Kele, Meng Tuoye, Bolang, Mu Hui, Gelaiqi, Tie Bosi, En Tuhe, Yikate, Paikesi, Hua Quansi.</p>
<p>(Encas) Kaijiemiluofu, Queli Botuo, Ge Pengqigu Fu, Gong Ge Pengqigu Fu, Ouchai Liao, Fuzha Ke, Bei Geni, Shasijin, Qi Quhu, Tao Bolinji, Bo Tou.</p>
<p>(Huili) Tian Fuhai, Cao Zhiji, Wang Yongfang, Wei Qixian, Wang Cunchong, Chen Zhengmiao, Ye Yunshan, Zhang Pu, Xu Shuyuan.</p>
<h3>Today's Basketball Friendly Match: Huili Plays Against Datong</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] At 2 PM today, a friendly basketball match will take place. Huili will compete against Datong University in the gymnasium. Le Jiaozhou, a strong player from Hualian, is also a member of the Datong team, so there may be a wonderful performance.</p>
<h3>Alumni Reunion of Zhongshan Physical Education College</h3>

<h3>Philippine International 400-meter Swimming Competition: Fatty Nan Ranks Fourth; Hong Kong and Philippine Overseas Chinese Plan to Hold Inter-City Team Competitions</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Shipping News] Chen Zhennan, who represented Hong Kong alone in the international swimming competition organized by the Philippine Athletic Association, made his second appearance at the Rizal Swimming Pool at 8 PM on the 6th, competing in the 400-meter freestyle.</p>
<p>In the 1,500-meter long-distance swimming competition on the first night, due to the gathering of famous players from all over the world, Fatty Nan fought hard but could only win fifth place. Although he was not too far behind, he only scored two points. However, judging from Chen Zhennan's strength, he has plenty of stamina but lacks speed. Therefore, people generally believe that Fatty Nan is more confident in the 1,500-meter long-distance race than in the 400-meter middle-distance race, which has shaken their hopes for him.</p>
<p>However, before Chen Zhennan's departure, at the farewell banquet in Liu Shiwen's private residence, Chen's coaches, the Huang Shaochi brothers, had already given him a secret plan, which was: When competing in the Philippines, he must be ahead of the crowd and strive to lead, especially in the shorter 400-meter race, to avoid repeating the mistake of last year's Hong Kong-Philippine inter-city competition, where he was "robbed" of too many leads, and although he was able to catch up hard afterwards, he still fell behind. Therefore, in the 400-meter final in the Rizal Memorial Swimming Pool last night, when the gun sounded, Chen Zhennan fought to get ahead. Among the nine athletes competing, Chen was between third and fourth place, which was slightly better than his championship in the 880-yard inter-city swimming competition that year.</p>
<p>The race involved swimming eight laps, and there was intense competition throughout. Zhennan's arms were strong in paddling water, but his feet were slightly heavy, which was a slight flaw. After 300 meters, he was overtaken by Mabasi and another Philippine World Games athlete, but Chen was still able to beat three or four other athletes by a body length and surpass the last swimmer by a distance of ten li. In the last lap, Chen was in fourth place until the end. The first place was a Philippine World Games athlete, Mabasi was second, and Chen was fourth, which was a step forward compared to his performance in the 1,500-meter race on the first night.</p>
<p>[Another News] Fatty Chen Zhennan has returned to Hong Kong on the 8th. According to him, the trip to the Philippines was due to a long period of lack of practice and the hot weather there. The swimming pool was also a freshwater pool with little buoyancy, which prevented him from reaching the expected level. He felt deeply sorry for not living up to expectations. According to reports, Chen participated in the 1,500-meter race and ranked fifth, with a score of around 23 minutes. The first, second, third, and fourth places were all Filipinos, and the first place's score was 21 minutes and 35.7 seconds. Chen was fourth in the 400-meter race, with a score of about 5 minutes and 30 to 40 seconds (Chen's highest record for this event is 5 minutes and 16 seconds). The first place's score for this event was 5 minutes and 18 seconds.</p>
<p>Chen also told reporters that during his trip to the Philippines, the Hong Kong Chinese swimming community entrusted him to contact the Philippine Overseas Chinese to hold a Hong Kong-Philippine Overseas Chinese inter-city swimming competition. He received the agreement of the Philippine Overseas Chinese. If it comes true, there may be a Hong Kong-Philippine Overseas Chinese swimming competition in Hong Kong in July or August.</p>
<h3>Olympic Committee: Germany Invited to Participate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, August 8] According to the Frankfurt News, German representatives have received invitations to participate in the International Olympic Committee's plenary session to be held in Rome next month. The invitation was sent to Duke Magenburg, who has been a member of the International Olympic Committee for a long time and also attended the London Conference last year. (Note: This move by the International Olympic Committee is tantamount to inviting Germany to participate in the next World Games.)</p>

<h3>Thinking of Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>If the circulation of silver dollars began in the Guangxu era, then it has been circulating in China for at least sixty or seventy years. Unexpectedly, after sixty or seventy years, after repeated reforms of the monetary system, it is still relying on silver dollars again. This shows that in China, changes and reforms are nothing more than returning to the original point.</p>
<p>The issuance of legal tender in the 24th year [of the Republic] and the emergence of "gold certificates" in the 37th year were both against silver dollars, but in the end, they were all defeated by silver dollars.</p>
<p>During the major reform of "August 19th," the government used "gold-containing" certificates to widely collect silver dollars, while at the same time imposing severe penalties to prohibit their circulation or possession. This time, it was indeed the end of silver dollars.</p>
<p>However, before long, silver dollars made a comeback. The elders and various "bosses" in the folk felt cordial when they reunited after a long separation, and people were all fortunate that the "silver dollar injustice" had been redressed. Precisely because of this, it aroused the "silver dollar craze" that swept the country. Those involved in the vortex included workers, farmers, soldiers, students, public and church staff, and so on.</p>
<p>These stories depict the tragedy of China's real economy and also illustrate a truth: In China, things that are deeply rooted are not easily eradicated at once.</p>
<p>Silver dollar transactions are unique: both secretive and grand. Everyone knows the inside story, so there is no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>Silver dollars are sometimes banned and sometimes released. The government once exchanged them in a continuous stream through deposit exchanges, but then said that buying and selling were not allowed, intending to make people eat silver dollars like pancakes. While saying that buying and selling are strictly prohibited, it allows them to come in and out.</p>
<p>What is the law in China? It is not difficult to understand from silver dollars.</p>
<p>Now, silver dollar trading is 100% legal under the "protection" of new financial cases.</p>
<p>Therefore, the silver bulls on Henan Road no longer take Ningbo Road as the boundary, but step south, and the territory expands to Nanjing Road. The rhythm of "Ke Dang" is faster and stronger than in the past, and the cries of "big and small heads buying and selling" are louder and more powerful than before.</p>
<p>Preview: Soon, this music can be played publicly on buses, trams, and public entertainment venues.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the traffic on Henan Road is too unruly, the authorities have heard that they are preparing to establish a silver dollar market. If so, in the future, speculation will no longer be limited to large gold and currency dealers, and small citizens can also go to the silver market to buy and sell short.</p>
<p>In the new plan, silver dollars can be said to be incorrect in name and unreasonable in wording: It is estimated as the standard for calculating salaries, and it is stipulated that gold yuan certificates are the only standard currency. It is preparing to manufacture 600,000 silver dollars a day, but it does not allow the market to price in silver dollars. It allows silver dollars to circulate, claiming financial reform and stabilizing prices, and at the same time, four major banknotes are issued together.</p>
<p>I think: The task of the new plan is only to turn the semi-public silver dollar speculative trading into public and legal; to protect the "occupation" of scalpers. In a turbulent society, there is an additional burden of raising parasitic elements.</p>
<p>There are indeed many strange things this year, but nothing is more interesting than the authorities' handling of silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Rogue · Ah Q · and Face</h3>
<p>— Si Yi</p>
<p>For several years, the six words "rogue, Ah Q, face" that are most likely to cause disputes between me and my wife are unavoidable in life, and we often argue about it until we are red in the face.</p>
<p>In her opinion, and as far as possible to implement; "A person living in the world must have face. Although face is hypocritical and worthless, we must try our best to seize it, because if a person does not care about face, that is a typical rogue."</p>
<p>Until now, because I understand her good intentions of "face", I pay part of the income in exchange for sweat and blood for "unnecessary" extra expenses. For example, the tap water used in my current residence is pumped from an artesian well by an electric motor. The monthly electricity bill is calculated for each residential building in the alley, and each residential building is calculated by household registration. Therefore, I, a family of four, bear the same number as a family of more than ten.</p>
<p>Of course, I am always indignant. Many times, I proposed to change this payment method, but my wife habitually came up with a simple logic.</p>
<p>She said: "If you propose to change, you originally want to be fair, but people will say that you can't afford to pay. Then they will call you a rogue. A person with face will never be willing to be a rogue. You just treat this unequal expenditure as relief for some charity."</p>
<p>I said, "In the end, you revealed the prototype of Ah Q. People like us need others to help us before we can help others?"</p>
<p>So, we argued like this again. She kept talking about "for the sake of face", but I was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Ah Q spent a lot of effort for "face" during his lifetime. However, after the coffin was closed, Ah Q's face not only did not "shine through the ages", but ended up in a "rogue" situation. What I feel most puzzled about is that in addition to my wife, there are so many heroes and heroes in the country who "are afraid of being rogues" and "fight for face", following Ah Q's legacy and "continuing to work hard" all day long. This allows truly unreasonable rogues to be blatant and act as if nothing happened in broad daylight.</p>
<h3>Talking about Money in Ancient and Modern Times</h3>
<p>— Xu Dasan</p>
<p>Light currency and heavy goods have been the case in ancient and modern times. Today, shops sell goods, some of which are priced in silver dollars, but if you pay with silver dollars, you still need to calculate it according to the gold yuan certificate. It is better to use gold yuan certificates because it is easier to calculate. The history of using banknotes in our country began with the "flying money" of the Tang Dynasty. In fact, "flying money" still has the nature of today's drafts. The "Jiaozi" and "Huizi" of the Song Dynasty, and the "Jiaochao" of the Jin Dynasty, were the real banknotes. The Yuan Dynasty always used banknotes. When Zhu Ming rose up, he cast copper coins in Nanjing for use in the world. At that time, officials asked the people to produce copper, and the people destroyed utensils and handed them over to the government, which was quite painful. However, merchants were accustomed to using banknotes, and they felt that it was inconvenient to use money, so they gave Ming Taizu an opportunity. Dameng banknotes were circulated throughout the world, and those who forged them were beheaded, and those who reported them were rewarded with twenty-five taels of silver, and the property of the criminals was still given. Soldiers stationed abroad were paid monthly salt with banknotes, and each salt field was given banknotes for labor costs. Public officials' salary rice was also given banknotes, and two thousand five hundred texts of banknotes were equivalent to one stone of rice. In fact, in the Jiangnan area, people valued money over banknotes, and one string (one thousand texts) of banknotes could only be exchanged for one hundred and sixty texts of copper coins. By the end of the Hongwu period, Dameng Bao banknotes had expanded by more than six times.</p>
<p>After Ming Chengdi ascended the throne, he further reiterated the prohibition of using gold and silver in transactions, and offenders would be sent to the army. At that time, Zhang Yu, a censor of the Shaanxi Dusi, was exiled for exchanging official banknotes. A commoner in Jiangxia died his father and used silver to build a funeral tool, and he would also be sent to the army according to the regulations. It was considered that he was forced to treat the funeral, not breaking the law, and was exempted by Chengzu. It can be seen that a few days ago, the gold and silver scalpers were caught and only detained for a few days, which was not serious.</p>
<p>The Ming Dynasty issued too many banknotes, and also embarked on the road of malignant inflation. In the early years of Shide, one stone of rice used fifty strings of banknotes, which had risen twenty times compared with the salary rice discount during the Hongwu period. At that time, the Ming Dynasty also tried to get the banknotes back into circulation, such as "collecting banknotes for salt according to the population" and "collecting banknotes for tax grain courses and fines". And it also sold goods, such as "ordering salt officials to pay old banknotes to pay for salt, issuing firewood accumulated in the Nanjing pumping field, bamboo and wood in the Longjiang Diju Division, and the military and civilians of Luzhi, to collect their banknotes". By the time of Yingzong and Xianzong, there were more banknotes, and one string of banknotes could not be worth one text. The people traded and simply calculated in rice, wheat, silver, and money. Yingzong opened the ban on the use of silver. However, the official salary was still paid with banknotes, which was really a dead end for civil servants. During the Xianzong period, it had to be ordered that internal and external taxes, money, and banknotes should be collected, and official salaries and military salaries should also be paid with money and banknotes. Although one string of banknotes was not worth one text at that time, the people who were levied on banknotes had to pay two cents and five li of silver for each string, which shows the high official price. It can be seen that if too many banknotes are issued, the issuer will also have to refuse to use them. Today, measures such as the customs, public utilities, and enterprises using customs yuan and the distribution of silver dollars for civil service salaries are all copied from old methods, which have existed since ancient times, and are not surprising.</p>
<h3>"Stability" and "Fairness"</h3>
<p>— Lei Ting</p>
<p>In order to seek "stability" in the prices of public utilities and to seek "fairness" in the burden on citizens, the municipal government has decided on a "calculation unit for public utilities" and has already put it into practice.</p>
<p>In this way, the prices of public utilities are really "stable", because from now on, public utilities will no longer have the trouble of requesting price adjustments, the authorities will not have the trouble of bargaining, and public utilities will no longer have the suspicion of leading price increases. It is really smart and extremely smart to achieve three goals at once. However, is the burden on citizens really fair?</p>
<p>From the perspective of burden alone, it can be said to be both fair and reasonable. Because how much water and electricity you consume, and how much distance you travel by bus and tram, anyone should pay the same price. (Although those wearing uniforms or wearing badges still do not care about this, but these are a small number of special citizens, who should be exceptions.) And this price is extremely "fair", the amount of which depends on the ups and downs of the customs yuan, and the ups and downs of the customs yuan depend on foreign exchange, and so on.</p>
<p>But after thinking about it, it is a little "unfair" and "unreasonable". Because the so-called burden, simply put, is expenditure, and expenditure is compared with income. We don't have to be as careful as the Jews, but at the very least we have to ensure that income can meet expenditure, even if it is a little difficult. If it is always in deficit, it is difficult to say.</p>
<p>However, what is the income of our general citizens? Factories and shops issue salaries based on the index (the index is based on gold yuan certificates, not customs yuan), and public officials issue salaries at 75 times, but their current expenses have to be calculated according to the so-called "fair" "calculation unit for public utilities". This calculation really calculates them to the point of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Of course, in this time of "national crisis", the people have the obligation to endure a little hardship. But it must also be endured willingly and it must also be eaten. If only the general powerless and weak citizens suffer, and high officials, large entrepreneurs, and large capitalists do not participate, how can that be masked by superficial "fairness"!</p>
<p>Or someone may say: Has this "calculation unit for public utilities", which has been carefully studied by the authorities, "failed" again? The answer is: No. However, the authorities have only done half of this plan. Because they put all their energy on "stability" and unconsciously neglected "fairness". And this kind of big plan that is only half done is often the most painful thing for small citizens. That's all!</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Dog Fighting</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Hong Kong newspapers reported that a "Famous Dog Competition Exhibition" was held in Guangzhou on the 6th of this month, which was organized by the Guangzhou National Sports Association. More than 100 fierce dogs participated, and there were dog fighting arenas and performance arenas in the venue. Among them, there was a dog raised by a Liang from Huangzhuqi Township, which was very brave and defeated more than 60 fierce dogs without any fear.</p>
<p>A couplet was hung at the entrance of the dog fighting arena. The text reads:</p>
<p>Do not discuss merits with Xiao He, do not teach Han Xin to call for help, relying on a brand new mind, ashamed to follow high-ranking officials who flatter superiors, learning to bark;</p>
<p>Do not flatter Xia Jie to attack Yao, do not attach to Jin Ling to fight with shields, relying on sharp claws and teeth, strive to face the current strong enemy, and strive to become famous.</p>
<p>Although the couplet is not good, it is quite thought-provoking.</p>
<h3>Western Humor</h3>
<p>— Su Zhai</p>
<p>In a crowded tram, a sailor was sitting on the lap of another sailor.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman came in.</p>
<p>The sailor pushed his friend away and said loudly, "A female passenger is here, hurry up and let her in."</p>
<p>Husband: "Now that we are married, I swear that I will no longer know a woman."</p>
<p>Wife: "Wait a minute, I am going to introduce one to you now, and that is your mother-in-law."</p>
<p>The father warned his son not to go to see the leg show.</p>
<p>"Why?" the son asked.</p>
<p>"Because you will see people you shouldn't see."</p>
<p>The son went to see it, and sure enough, he saw the person he shouldn't see,——his father.</p>
<p>A lady said:</p>
<p>"Women like to talk a lot, but we have only said half of what we know."</p>
<p>There was a woman in Chicago who said during her fifth divorce: "There are not few men, but there are too few good ones."</p>
