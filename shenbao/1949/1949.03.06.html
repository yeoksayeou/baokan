<h3>和談主案人整理階段　編軍爭求合理平等　對憲法法統聯合政府等並無成見　十人委會將作最後商討</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕政府方面之對共和談方案正積極研討中，最困難之改編軍隊問題，亦已獲得初步意見。據悉：負責研擬方案之十要員，連日巳會談數次，其會談方式係就中共所提八項條件內容，由十要員分別提供個人之意見及對案，一一紀錄，然後整理歸納，彙成整個意見；再根據此項意見，擬定方案。談話時之紀錄及整理工作，經推定劉斐·鐘天心二氏負責。孫院長爲期迅速起見，曾呈准李代總統邀請吳經熊·甘介侯二氏協助。吳甘二氏於過去數次會談時，均獲准列席。刻十要員之意見，業經發表元畢。劉·鍾·吳·甘四氏正埋頭於整理歸納之工作，可望於二三日內元畢。屆時十要員當再舉行會談，詳予研討。記者五日晚向極可靠之權威方面探詢，獲悉主持和談十要員之意見，大致相同。彼等認爲戰犯問題表面雖極重要，實際上可能有（討價還價）之作用在內，將來仍有機會折衝商討。關於憲法法統及聯合政府，政府方面並無成見，惟須堅持爭取人民生活自由一點。土地改革及沒收官僚資本問題，政府方面亦曾有此擬議，惜未能澈底執行。政府與中共在些一點上，並無甚大之矛盾；惟改編軍隊一項則爲實際問題中之最困難者。該方面透露民國卅五年國共協商之整軍方案，曾爲該十要員研討時之重要參考，然以時過境遷，諸多不適合之處。若干人士意見，以爲最妥善之辦法爲「分治」，然此辦法勢難通過。大約不致提出。數要員主張雙方軍隊之處理，應以「由整編到統編」爲原則，所謂「整編」卽雙方各將所有軍隊自行整理縮編减少至最低限度，因目前國富民力均不容許有數百萬大軍常川受人民之供養也。所謂「統編」係將雙方軍隊於自行整編元畢之後，再予統一，成爲國家之武力。該方面指出不諭整編統編，旣非如政協時代之五比一辦法，將共軍編入國軍，亦非如傅作義式之被改編，將國軍編入共軍，而係依據合理平等之原則，統一編制。至比例問題，則不擬規定，留待雙方正式談商時，再行決定。關於整軍問題，除十要員所發表之意見外，並推定劉斐負責，與軍方人士另行談商，聽取軍事負責人之意見。再以被等所提出之方案，作爲十人研討時之參考。</p>

<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕據南京消息：西北軍政長官張治中建議以全省貿易及航空專有權利給與蘇聯，期限五十年，政府其他人員則加以反對。外交部提議修正，第一縮短新蘇協定之期限，第二以最惠國條款代替蘇聯之專利。最惠國條款應用於此項協定，意卽中國希望蘇聯與被認爲最惠國之其他國家，在新省同享權利。按照外交上普通習慣，凡締約國家實際均可視爲量惠國，故此條之意義，無異在新疆省實施門戶開放政策。張氏雖南下，仍由其代表在迪化與蘇聯人員接洽，而不由外交部主持。中國政府曾於去年九月正式通知蘇聯，擬廢除中穌航空協定，但據中央社消息，蘇聯代表五人已抵新疆省會，不僅將討論訂立民用航空新協定，且將兼及範圍更大之問題，如新疆與蘇聯西伯里亞各共和國之關係等。此外雙方談判人員或並將討論新疆各族之不斷衝突，前傳蘇聯將獲得開採新疆礦產之專有權，已由張氏加以否認。</p>

<h3>星其論壇　一個新印刷方法的嘗試</h3>
<p>— 世榮</p>
<p>—中國科學期刊協會年會印刷報告之一—</p>
<p>印刷本來是文化的關鍵工具，不但在應用手續上須簡單便利，而在成本方面吏須低廉經濟，庶可以供應社會，作普遍的採用，達成傳播文化促成進步的目的。任何用字母維成文字的國家，它的印刷方法巳經由手排改爲機器排字，例如Lyno　type。機器，祗須將原稿用特製之打字機先行打過一遍，則所有鉛字卽全部澆製排列完畢，再經過一次配版手續，將版式佈憧妥當，卽可製版印刷，殊屬簡便。且因應用字母不多，訓練熟手，俾成專技，亦殊易易。不獨如此，由Lyno　type打字機檢出之鉛字，手民錯誤又少，便利校對，更難勝言。</p>
<p>就我國文字估計，常用字約有三千字，如與罕用字一併計算，不下六千字，遇須排版印刷，不但需用設備繁多，且因不能運用機器檢排，加以檢字時，又因字種太多，在在足以引起較多之　誤，至爲排列校對所費時間之參，更無論矣。再進一步說，如果文字內包括有數學公式或化學分子構成式，則排字手續，尤費周章，實非一般印刷公司所可勝任。</p>
<p>文印刷衛所有之種種內在缺陷，已屬盡人皆知，研究改進，實已刻不容緩。本人主辦「現代鐵路」雜誌，對於印刷技術，雖少研究，然地獄時不希望從事文化之人士，對此有所積極的改進。於是改用中文打字機先行打成底稿，再用照相縮影後用橡皮版印刷，經過數閱月之研究改善，迄至目前，幸已有初步之成就。茲以中國科學期刊協會舉行二週年年會，爰將改進印刷方法經過情形提出報告，以供參考。又此次初步成就，雖離理想尚遠，不足作爲最後之結諭，惟事關啓關文化關鍵工具，不敢自秘·如獲印刷先進，不吝指導，幷進而共同研究，曷勝感幸！</p>
<p>查照相製版之原稿，必須墨色均勻，筆劃粗細尤須一致，至筆劃中如有缺筆等更所不許，否則攝出之底版甚難淸晰悅目。故尋常照相橡皮版之文字，槪須先將原稿用鉛字排刊，再行照相製版，卽取其能有元整字體之意。此項手續，甚不經濟。普通利用此項辦法者，僅在有銅版之圖片時，如下附少許說明文字，以所佔地位不多，爲節省銅片發用計，乃加以採用。至共他文字印刷，均限於鉛印，採用此辦法者，尚不多觀也。</p>
<p>「現代鐵路」難誌爲力求改善印刷方法，曾採取此項辦法，將文稿用打字機打印。在起初試騐時，打出之文字，墨色極不均勻；如不用墨油改用黑色複寫紙，則筆劃亦不甚淸晰；如經放大詳察，輒見每一筆劃兩旁均以浸印糢糊，難以悅目。幾經研究，乃改用極薄之紙張，正面用黑色墨油，背面再襯黑色複寫紙，則打出之字樣，色彩方較均勻，勉可應用。最近各期之「現代鐵路」雜誌，卽係採此方法先製成底稿後始出橡皮版印刷者。</p>
<p>復查中文打字機內所具備之字模，僅有一種，而排刋文稿時，必須用多種大小及各種式樣之字體，始敷應用·「現代鐵路」雜誌爲解決此項困難，除正文用打字機打出外，至如文題標頭及其他另須特種之字體，悉用各種圖案字體用人工寫出，予以補入。所幸此類特製之字體在文稿內尚不多見，而書寫大型字體亦較易易。至打字機之字體雖只有一種大小，然如經照相，亦可以縮小成某種預期之大小。以「現代鐵路」雜誌過去經騐言，如將原文縮成五號字至六號字大小之間，尚極滿意，亦無困難，至放攝過大或縮製過小時，則不甚相宜，要之有五六號字左右大小之字體，對任何雜誌，當可應用也。</p>
<p>在中文打字機內，對遇須揷入數字公式或化學方程式時，則無法解決，遇此情形，亦唯有仰賴人工書寫後揷補於正文之內·如在一般工程職業者，用圖案字繕寫字體或算式，均不惑費力，稍具經體者，卽能應付裕如。故對上項用以掙補之各種字體，事實上並無困難也。</p>
<p>再如印刷費用方面，鉛印與照相橡皮版計算方法不同，必須個別比較，始能明瞭。若將打字費照相費與排字及澆製鋅版或銅版費用相比，則前者確爲低廉，惟印工則橡皮版較貴。在引述數量較少時，此項事實，益甚顯著。又在鉛印排學遇橫徘排及表格或有算學公式時，按章均須另加費用，而文內如　有銅鋅版，則除本身製版費用外，其所佔之地位，仍須照算排工，殊不合算·用「現代鐵路」雜誌方法，遇印刷橫排或表格並算學八式時，均與直行印費相埓，所增加之發用，並不過多，而由本法直接照相，免除製作銅鋅版之發用，更屬可觀。</p>
<p>由上所述，就全盤費用比較，照相橡皮版所需各費，遠較鉛印爲廉。「現代鐵路」雜誌，自試用本法以來；已深受其惠。</p>
<p>更有欲言者，「現代鐵路」難誌採用本法，並不能向認爲發明，緣在歐美各國，早有類似此項辦法。例如目前歐美市塲所出售之Vari-Typer打字機，可以打出各種型類之字體，用特製之薄紙製造之色帶，並用電動方法打出，則字體均勻筆劃淸晰鮮明，其照相印成之出品，與鉛印者相較，　無軒輊，堪稱美滿。目前中國之一般中文打字機，缺點太多，故打出之成績，難合理想。然經「現代鐵路」雜誌初加嘗試，巳得差告滿意之或就。仍盼出版界同業，共同推廣，詳予研究，俾獲更進一步之結果。如將來電動打字機問世，廉債供應（高仲芹氏已有出品，林語堂氏亦巳在美試驗成功），則打字成績，當可進步，似可逆料。</p>
<p>由於「現代鐵路」雜誌初次的嘗試，不惟在經濟上設想，更希圖於運用研究精神方面，導致另一途徑，爲我國印刷方法上作一新的改革。區區微忱，仍盼各出版先進，共策進行，以期有成耳。</p>
<p>上前中國印刷工業，自以上海首屈一指，不惟設備充實而且技術優良，出品美滿，在內地如希冀瑕海並比，目前尙不可能。然如欲獲得優良之印刷，仍可採用上述方法，先交底稿打製並整理元畢，再郵寄上海代爲印刷，當極便利。</p>
<h3>改進公教人員待遇　恢復逐月調整辦法　依當月份生活費指數分歐核定標準　政院臨時政務會議通過</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕由主計部提出之改進公敎人員待遇調整辦法，已於今日行政院臨時政務會議中通過，自本年三月份起，恢復俠照各地生活費指數分區標準逐月調整辦法，並於每月月初依照上月支給標凖預發一部份　津。惟薪俸基數計算辦法，則由原定六十元基數以上至三百元爲百分之四十，三百元以上爲百分之廿，咸爲六十元以上至三百元爲百分之廿，三百元以上爲百分之十。茲誌新調整辦法如次：</p>
<p>（一）自本年三月份起，公敎人員待遇依當月份各地公務員生活費指數分區調整；（二）俸薪中之基數爲六十元，基數以上部份六十元至三百元爲百分之廿，三百元以七爲百分之十；（三）每屆月終，主計部就調查所得各地公務員生活費指數，擬具分區調整支給標準表呈請行政院核定施行；（四）每屆月初，各機關員工薪餉先照上月份支給標準預發，俟月終核定調整案後，再將增加部份補發，如有超支，則在次月份預發數內扣回；（五）三月份各機關負工薪餉，先照二月份支給標準之三倍預發，俟月終核定調整案後再依前條規定多退少補；（六）立法委員監察委員歲費公費及各級人負公費隨同調整，並照政府所在地區標準核計支給。</p>
<p>據主計部指陳，查公敎人員待遇，依照各地生活費指數分區核定標準，逐月調整，施行已久，並經逐步改善，迨至上年入月改革幣制，實施限價，薪俸工資曾予凍結，調整辦法遂卽廢止，其後物價漸漲，員工生活無法維持，復參照過去辦法，於上年十一月起，先後調整三次，惟以政府濟情勢，一方面須考慮核算發款領款等技術問題，而分區擬定標凖，其所得結果自不免與各地實際情形有所出入，其在物價劇烈渡動之際，尤覽難於適應；本部詳加研究，以爲去年六七月間改定辦法，依當月指數調整待遇，比較切近實際，而每屆月初俠照上月支給標準預發一部份薪津，於員工生活影響亦大，該部爰將調整辦法及發欽兩方面提出改進意見。</p>
<h3>國庫支出突增　決裁軍减政</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕據某財政主管人士五日語記者：政院五日通過之公敎人員待遇調整辦法，其實行之結果，國庫之支出突增加數倍，實爲過重之負擔，然文武公敎人員待遇調整，係由於政府決定革新政治，在革新政治計劃中，若千不必要之機關及冗員均將分別裁汰，一切簡化機構，加强工作效率，一以節省開支，减輕國庫負擔，其中最感困難者，厥爲軍費問題，武職人員包括兵在內，軍餉一項，所佔比例至鉅·五日政務會中討論待遇間題時，對此顧慮甚多，孫科院長前主張將所有官兵員額减至五百入十萬人，事實上仍超出實額，國庫無法負擔，故財政當局仍主核减，俾以節省之數，移爲增加待遇之需；國防部方面以事實所限，亦有甚多困難。五日會中及一會後，徐堪部長與徐永昌部長詳一加研討結果，始決定按國百廿萬人核列，所减之數雖不甚多，但對國庫己不無小補。至政治方面之各機構裁减緊縮，尚未實行，如能依照革新方案切實做去，則公敎待遇雖增加數倍，實際增加之支出反而比例减少，益以政府稅收方面之比一例增加，國庫收支當不致過分龐大，</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕三月份之軍費數額問題，五日政務會中首提出討論，國防部仍主張軍隊之最低數額應爲四百廿萬人，三月份之軍費仍按此標準支給，財·糧·主計等部苜長則力爭應再予减少。討論甚久，迄散會時仍無結論。會後，徐堪與徐永昌再度研究，仍商定按四百廿萬人支給。</p>
<h3>折發銀元事　數額未決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕關於武職人員及士兵待遇折發銀元事，五日會中亦曾討論，折合數額尚未決定，惟武職人員中待遇最高者亦僅折合十五元至廿八元，至是否全部均發銀元，則尚待研究。</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫米高揚被免職　維辛斯基任蘇外長　孟許柯夫繼長對外貿易部</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦四日電〕莫斯科電台四日宣稱：任蘇聯外長已有十年之莫洛托夫及對外貿易部長米高揚業被免職。該廣播稱，外次維辛斯基已繼任莫洛托夫之職位。此次乃爲蘇聯內閣戰爭以還最大之更動。據該廣播稱，「最高蘇維埃主席團議決，部長會議副主席莫洛托夫同志准免外交部長兼職，任命維辛斯基同志爲外交部長。部長會議副主席米柯揚同志准免對外貿易部長兼職，任命孟許柯夫同志爲對外貿易部長」。按莫洛托夫之級位僅次於史達林總理，莫氏在戰前乃蘇聯之總理。莫氏於一九三九年繼李維諾夫出任外長之職，於一九四一年德攻穌聯，史達林卽任總理。　〔合衆社倫敦四日電〕西方外交家在聽到到屢次在國際會議中誇張聲勢的維辛斯基，業已代替深思熟慮的莫洛托夫出任蘇聯外長的消息後，卽發出一個問題，「克林姆宮現在究將如何」？是否史達林準備退休，而將大權諉諸最親信的莫洛托夫同志，而使之負責蘇聯共黨政治局，抑史達林凖備在其冬變的外交政策中，再來一次曲折。顯然地莫洛托夫仍留任副總理（部畏會議副主席）故關於莫氏之繼續爲蘇聯政治上僅次於史達林具有權力的人物，殊無疑問。但自從蘇聯，上次更換其外長以來，任何行動都沒有像這一次能引起西方的注意，而且在上次更換中，是莫洛托夫代替了西方的偉大友人李維諾夫，而在這一次更調中，莫洛托夫及其忠實的次長維辛斯基，均不能稱爲西方之友，因此其動機更難明暸。西方人士認為維辛斯　基之繼任長外，除顯示蘇聯將對西方採取强硬態度，因爲在歷屆國際會議中，維辛斯基始終以紅而的姿態出現。故如古林姍宮正計劃對西方的強硬政策，維辛斯苦當爲最合理想的執行人物，不過維辛斯基的聯權，大致也只在執行而已。同時如史達林計劃界予莫洛托夫更大的職權，維辛斯基以其多年担任外次的地位，當然亦爲最適當的繼任人選。如此種揣測屬實，則此項更調不過是換了一個角色，而依然繼續同樣的政策而已。</p>
<p>〔合衆社普拉格四日電〕維辛維基在訪遊捷古著名瘠養勝地加爾基巴達地方數週之後，已返莫斯科。傳維氏係於上月抵此間休養，一般相信維氏曾與若干外國共黨領袖會晤，包括德共黨領袖在內。</p>

<h3>蘇聯外交今後動向　華府持靜觀態度　認美蘇關係未心能有改善希望</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕外交當局與國會議員今日對於蘇聯外次維辛斯基繼任外長，紛加揣測，莫衷一是。或謂此係東西雙方冷戰中之危險行動，或謂蘇聯將對西方各國採取軟化態度，又或謂不過通常之政界調動。但各方僉認惟有等待將來發展，始能澄淸局勢。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統·國務卿艾契遜·則國務卿馬歇爾·參院外委會主席康納利及前主席范登堡等人，則均不願發表意見。參院外委會共和黨議員史密預料蘇聯將有某　急劇行動，可能爲對挪威與丹麥之軍事行動。蘇聯政策轉爲强硬，乃因中國等地局勢造成。民主黨衆議負黎嘉茲認爲新行動不外兩種方向，卽對美更加强硬，或對美改善關係。共和黨參議員福開森稱：未來國際關係並無因此改善之希望，或將益趨惡化。　維氏之反美言論向較莫氏激烈，猶憶莫洛托夫昔繼李維諾夫任外長時，衆信蘇聯對於西歐與美國可較友好，詎料蘇聯卒在第二次世界大戰前，突然與納粹德國締結不侵犯條約。</p>
<h3>米高揚免職　英法尤重視</h3>
<p>認爲加强冷戰之惡兆</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦五日電〕英外部五日接護駐蘇大使彼得遜之「緊要報告」，傳該報告指莫洛托夫之去職，及晋陞而非降級。英外部官員認爲此項宜佈被形容過甚，幷警告勿太重視調動之事。法人士認爲米高揚被免貿易部長事，更重要而更多惡兆，因米氏爲克林姆宮內層圈最其西方思想之人。西歐外交家亦知此項調動可爲繼續，甚至加强東西爭鬥之謂。若干蘇聯問題專家甚至認爲維辛斯基代莫洛托夫出任外長事，或僅爲要員之另一調動，在凖備史達林之承繼人而已。不論突然調動之意義何在，莫米二氏現仍爲蘇聯政治局之委員，而維氏及新貿易部長孟許柯夫則否，政治局爲眞正作決定之蘇聯最高權威團體。</p>
<h3>僅戰略變動　非政策易轍</h3>
<p>捷克官方之暗示</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約五日「廣播：普拉格訊，捷克消息靈通人士稱，蘇聯外長之更迭，恐僅爲外交戰略之變動而非外交政策之變動。某捷古官員稱，「在最近之將來，維辛斯基出而執行外交政策，恐較爲適當」。一般捷人對此訊皆表驚異。匈牙利官方對此拒不置評，今日晚報中竟並未刊載此訊。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕此間政界人士稱，蘇聯現或在凖備擬訂一項計劃，旨在鞏固其戰後在東歐所得，而非擴大其控制。但彼等力稱，蘇聯政策如有任何改變，則將在策略方而而不在目的方面。彼等復擊告切勿認爲蘇聯已放棄其控制世界之長期計劃。</p>
<h3>維辛斯基略歷</h3>
<p>蘇聯新外長維辛斯基，一入八三年生於烏克蘭之敖德薩，畢業於基夫大學法學院。一九〇二年加入社會民主黨，從事革命運動，一九〇五年在高加索拔古一帶工作，曾數度被捕入獄。一九二三年執行律師業務，一九二五年在莫斯科大學任法律敎授。一九三五年起任檢察官，蘇聯淸黨時，維辛斯基正任淸黨法庭檢察官，從此聲譽鵠起，一九三七年又被推選爲蘇聯科學院法律研究所所長。一九三八年當選爲人民委員會副主席，嗣後改任外交委員會副主席，並代表出席地中海同盟會議及巴黎和平會議，一九四六年聯合國第一屆大會在倫敦開會，任蘇聯代表團首席代表，後聯合國大會兩次開會於紐約，均充任代表。一九四七年倫敦四國外長會議，隨莫洛托夫一同出席。多瑙河會議任蘇聯首席代表。維辛斯基爲人精明幹練，能言善辯，在各次國際會議上，與西方國家外交家展開舌戰。曾於一九三七年·一九四三年及一九四五年三度獲得列寗勳軍。</p>
<h3>蘇報均未置外</h3>
<p>僅刋載簡短消息</p>

<h3>聯合國一般人士觀察　蘇政策不致變更　莫洛托夫免職實爲昇遷預兆</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖四日電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫免職消息傳來，此間聯合國代表咸覺驚異。某外交家評稱，莫洛托夫之免職實爲昇遷之預兆，蘇聯政策不致變更。莫氏仍任副總理，或將代替史達林出任總理，莫氏辭去外長，可卸下一部份重負</p>
<p>其他外交家認爲莫氏是否升遷，未可逆料。蘇聯問題專家起先得訊莫氏辭職，認爲此乃蘇聯結好西方國家之嘗試，旋聞米高揚辭去對外貿易部長之職，乃覺蘇聯政策並無變化。米氏被認爲蘇聯政治局十四委員中最親近西方之一人。新任外長維辛斯基必將繼續進行冷戰，攻擊西方變本加萬。維氏在去秋聯合國巴黎大會時克盡厥職，顯然博得莫斯科當局之歡心。維氏在會中發表攻擊美英法之演說多次，一般人原以爲今年四月聯合國紐約大會時，維氏將再祖任蘇代表團長，此次升任外長後將否親自出席，或令外次馬立克出席頗費揣測，另一外次葛羅米柯可能捲土重來·</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華感頓五日廣播：成功湖訊，聯合國各外交家預測，前蘇駐聯合國代表葛羅米柯可成爲維辛斯基之主要輔佐。我外交當局看法</p>
<h3>蘇聯遠東政策　不致受影響</h3>
<p>我外交當局看法</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京五日電〕此間外交當局今日對於蘇聯外長莫洛托夫與對外貿易部長米高揚免職一事，甚爲關切，但認此舉不致直接影響蘇聯之遠東政策。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京五日電〕駐日美外交及軍事情報官員，五日均在研究莫洛托夫解職的消息，以測定蘇聯遠東政策是否有改變的跡象。若干人士認爲維辛斯某代替莫洛托夫，顯示蘇聯政策的改變，但在預測將在何處及如何改變時，則均採謹愼態度。然渠等指出，目前蘇聯在默洲遭遇的外交挫折，可能使蘇聯加强其遠東政策，俾挽回其威一望</p>

<h3>倫敦人士看法　蘇聯此次人事變動　反映內部尖銳鬥爭</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦四日電〕此間外交界獲悉維辛斯基出任外長，大爲驚異，並對此事近因頗加揣測。一部份人士認爲或與西方各國目前談判北大西洋條約有關</p>

<h3>公用事業關元計價　財部電滬希予停止　市長解釋此爲不得已辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕滬公用事業收費以關元計算，政院及財部並未核准財部已電滬市長吳國楨，指出公用事業以關元取費不妥，希予停止。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自本市公用事業改按關元計價後，一般反響，均爲不勝負担之惑。各方面咸以爲關元價格，與美金相聯繫，故公用事業改按關元計價，不啻爲變相之改取美金價格，顯然已殺金圓券之流通價值。一般商業習慣及薪津階級之收入，均以金圓券爲本位，而以生活指數爲金圓券價值增貶之指標，固未聞該項指標，有以關元替代之說，且公用事業旣能以關元爲計價之標凖，則其他如房租，一般物價等，均將援例改變計價基數，影響所及，勢將陷人民生活及金圓券之前途於絕境。</p>
<p>吳市長因市民羣表反對，於昨日下午接見記者時，特爲解釋決定此項措置，實爲萬不得已之辦法。渠歷述各公用事業公司經濟方而所遭受之困難情形，略稱：由於公用事業成本直接受外匯上漲影響，故時有經濟周轉不業之苦。二月份間，曾三底價發生經濟恐慌，先後向國行中央銀行借款計金圓八億餘元，始告渡過難關，最後一次係公司無錢發員工薪津，經本人親向國行劉總裁請求撥借，而劉總裁因現鈔頭寸缺乏，答以無能爲力。經本人再。　請其設法，並告以各公司或因此卽有斷水斷電之虞，始經劉總裁竭力設法，勉予撥借二億餘元。根據如是　驗，如公用事業之經濟本身不謀澈底解決辦法，預料本月份卽將無法繼續雜持。且自政府公怖新經濟方案後，決議中央後不再貼補，是則公用事業之必須自力更生，乃現響間題，故而明知新調整方案實施後，必遭各界靑難，惟爲維護公用事業計，不得不出此下策也。，</p>
<p>吳市長又稱：雖則公用事業計價單位係按照關元標凖，實際上乃以「八一九」基數之金圓券爲根據。因政府頒發金圓券之初，本會規定四元金圓合美金一元，卽一元金圓合美金二角半，現行之公用事業單位卽以此作爲基數吳氏又表示；公用事業以關元調整後，大多數市民並未蘇受影響，諸如商店及工廠，其貨價旣係逐日調整，則對公用事業當可負担。至於薪水階級如係按照生活指數支薪者，亦不致脫節，因經市府統計結果，生活指數之上漲係與外匯相平衡。至於公用事業以關元調整後，最直接受威脅者，當爲公敎人員，現市府正設法舉辦員工水電津貼，俾資彌補云。</p>
<h3>參會公用組　將開會研究　議長晤市長亦表示反對</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會議長潘公展，昨日下午六時許，曾至市府晤吳市長，對公用事業計價方式有所商談。據潘議長語記者：公用事業調整價格雖屬必需，惟對於慣格單位，以關元結算一點，渠個人則表示反對。現市參議會公用小組卽擬召開會議，對公用事業調整價格之方式，予以研究，並供市府參考。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕市參議員張中原，爲反對公用事業以關元計價，曾函吳市長，請予收回成命。茲悉吳市長爲此昨特邀請張參議員至市府談話，告以市府核准該項辦法，在於維護公用事業，望能諒解其苦衷。如將夾能有更妥當之方法解決公用事業之經濟困難，市府當願採納改良。</p>
<p>工界方面　表示抗議</p>
<p>本市公用事業價格自照關關元收費後，各界均表不滿，尤以本市工人均感無法負擔。昨據總工會理事長周學湘談，此次公用事業調整以「關元」計算，價格一日一變，極不合理，渠表示目前物價上漲，生活指數增高，調整價格自屬應當，但如此計算辦法，實係領導物價上漲，且工人收入工賣係金圓券，付出則需以關元折合計算，實影響工人生活，總工會方面對此問題已加考慮，爲全市工人生活安全起見，表示抗議，幷訂於日內向各有關機關請求立卽停止按照此項計算辦法收費云。</p>
<h3>單位折價續漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公用局昨發表：今明（六日七日）兩日每一公用事業計價單位，合金圓九百三十七元五角。</p>
<h3>公用局長談話　水電付款期　放寬爲七天</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者爲各界對公用事業以關元計價一點有所責難，特於昨日下午五時，走訪公用局長趙會珏，探詢對此點之意見。趙局長稱：公用事業價格）以關元爲根據，在求公用事業之自力更生，爲維護計，不得已而出此。渠稱：市府亦未嘗不以市民之員担爲念，爲頗全普通用戶不受關元與金圓券比價綢整之影響，關於水電兩項之爲款日期，公用局已令谷公司放寬爲七天，各公司於抄表後，應於三大內發出賬單，用戶可於接獲賬單後四天內繳付並對限期內之繳款單位折合率，亦已令飭各公司應依抄表日之折合率爲凖，逾期方得照新折合率接收。又上述所謂普通用戶，在上海電力公司區，係指月耗量五千度以下之用戶，法商閘北浦東區爲二千度以下，華商區爲一千度以下，自來水爲五百立方公尺以下，（浦東區三百立方公尺以下）。公用局並盼用戶能予預，，則可不致受到關元元折合率調整之影響云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕貨物稅之征　問題，捲菸及棉紡兩大工業，日來紛紛召集業內負責人會議結果，亦一致認爲無決負担，蓋在目前環境下，產銷已無把握，增加負担結果，勢將陷該業於停頓之境，故亦紛請仍維原制。昨日市上盛傳財政當局對尚未公布之財金方案實施細則，當將顧到現實上之困難，擬定對穩定經濟安定民生切實有效而可行之條例，以便推行盡利。紀者昨曾再向各關係方面探詢該實施細則可能之內容，該方面均諱莫如深，僅稱方案仍在徐財長袋中·至外傳金銀市塲卽將於週一恢復之說，該方面亦無法予以證實。</p>

<h3>浦東南巡禮　人民疾苦深　賦額負擔繁重　農村喘息不遑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「浦東南」區域包括奉賢，川沙，南匯等縣，東濱大海，與本市尤息息相關，該區最近動態如何，記者昨曾前往巡視，結果發現一可喜之現象，卽地方行政人員對目前政治必需改革之認識及自覺，顯已漸臻深切·近年來鄕區人民所受之痛苦，正與日俱增，此種痛苦絕非都市中人所能想像，一般地方官吏在實際臨政體騐中，處處棘手，故亦漸與人民之希望合流，而終至發出要求政治改革之呼聲。以奉賢一縣爲例，該縣總人口僅廿四萬人，但擔負賦額之繁重實堪驚異，如第一期征兵配額六〇九名，每名安家費白米二十石，總數卽需一萬二千石；卅七年補征自衛特捐額二萬五千石；駐境部隊副食差額每月需米二千石；修建浦東大道需米三千石；僅此已使目前有四五口之農村家庭，喘息不遑。一方面縣府嚴比催索，挪東補西，以應付上級督繳，但其本身之全部人員辦公費，每月僅六百餘元。</p>

<h3>「箱屍顯靈」？北車站對誕傅說　站工窺見隔室有人徘徊　翌晨冉探不覺毛髮悚然</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕火車箱屍案，昨日起已由市警局與兩路警務處合作進行偵查，據彼等表示，新綫素雖有發現，惟距破案尚遠，反之，案情越覺複雜迷惑，已入偵查工作上之苦悶階段，此案兇犯行事之精密，布置之週詳，爲歷來兇案中所詳見，如被害人之家屬至今未見出首，屍塊與皮箱上未留下指印，箱屍運至北站後，運屍人從容逸去，未留下任何可資利用價查之痕跡，凡此種種，均足證明，本案兇犯從犯均爲俱有相當犯罪經騐而異常奸狡之徒，故屍箱中發現之女大衣，女子內褲等物，頗可能爲兇犯</p>
<p>故佈疑陣</p>
<p>以移轉警探注意目標，使偵查工作走入歧途。現市警局與路警處正埋頭苦幹，任何足供偵查之綫索，均不放鬆。路處負靑主辦該案之金志文所長定明親自赴杭州布置，因不諭「箱屍」是從浙贛路轉來，或滬杭路任何車站運來，杭州總爲一極重要之似查據點。</p>
<p>北火車站</p>
<p>昨日又盛傳「箱屍」聯靈伸寃之怪事，事雖毫無科學根據，但言者　　，姑記之以待研究靈魂學者參考。緣「霜屍」經日前地檢處騐屍後，所有盛裝屍塊之大小皮箱兩隻及箱中撿出之女大衣，內褲，黃軍毯，棉花胎，報紙等物，仍交路警處帶回，以便隨時研究，此項物件均鎖藏於北站京錫警分段贓物儲藏室，，該室位於北站大廳左側後埭，其隣室爲，上工人臨時宿舍，兩室間以木板相隔，前日夜問宿舍中僅站工許某一人住宿，彼事前未知隔室藏有此等物件，至夜半，許於睡夢中聞呻吟聲，時斷時績，許乃起坐（傾耳細聽，又聞咯咯嚼齒之聲，自隣室傳出，許某離床至板壁隙縫中張望，見室中燈覺明亮，（該室通宵不熄燈）一人在屋中往來徘徊，因隙縫極低，不能</p>
<p>望見面部</p>
<p>許某尚以爲警警所拘獲人犯，囚於此室中，乃釋然就寢。淸晨五時許，許起身準備接班工作，憶及昨夜之事，再往隣室探視，見室門嚴鍵，拉推不開，從室門上半部之小鐵橋中向內一望，則但見皮箱及棉花胎等物，而無人踪，許木然良久，急急離去，回想隔夜所聞所見，不覺毛髪悚然，竟無心工作，經同伴相訽，始吐露上情，皆大爲詫異。記者得訊往訪，許初不肯承認，經一再堅詢，始謂確有其事，並爲記者詳述經過，言下似猶有餘悸·警務當局昨因此事已將皮箱等物另藏他處，以免再生疑神疑鬼之事。</p>

<h3>傅作義的家屬　馬繼援將軍一度訪謁</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州二日航訊〕這襄的崑崙報（暫出週刊）上，刊載着一則平凉短訊，說傳宜生先生的太夫人現在平凉住家，駐防該地的八十二軍軍長馬繼援將軍，曾前往拜訪，並代表他父親——馬主席步芳致候·　下面，是這位只有二十九歲的靑年將領親自撰寫的訪問記。馬繼援將軍對新文學有極度的愛好，卽在去年隴東會戰，軍書傍午的時候，還手不釋西洋名著，他的宙室裏常懸掛一些大文豪的畫像和語錄，這是去年中外記者在訪問隴東時衆所共見的；在道篇充滿人情味的訪問記裏，我們不但可以欣賞到他流利的筆法，感覺到他充沛的熱情，同時，還可以反映出一個西北靑年將領對傳宜生先生的看法。</p>
<p>像小學教員的家</p>
<p>前一天才聰到傅宜生（作義）先生的家屬從西安起身往平凉來，想是要到蘭州州去的，後來又聽到傳先生的太夫人久住平凉，已將近十年了！我很奇異，我爲什麼連一點兒都不知道·</p>
<p>我是先請黎副處長（記者按：黎氏爲八十二政工處副處長）拜訪一次，打聽淸楚後我再去拜訪，黎君歸來說是不錯，傅先生的叔父一家十餘口已赴蘭，這裏仍然是久住的太夫人及家人等，幷且他說：「想不到傅先生的家裏是那樣的普通，普通得像一個小學敎員的家一樣。」我聽了這話，更覺奇異！</p>
<p>太夫人站在門口</p>
<p>今天我特地凖備了兩籃水某，和黎君一同去看望太夫人，家住在平凉城內西大街，門牌我倒忘了，路上一直覺着不像是去謁見長官的太夫人，而是像看望自己的姑母似的。</p>
<p>太夫人站在門口招呼我們，很像我小時候抱我的奶媽，樸實得跟平民一樣，一間寢室兼客房，太夫人坐在炕上，叫我坐在炕邊的板櫈上，沒有客氣，也沒有虛套，一種親切的慈愛充滿了這問小而又陰的房間。</p>
<p>牆上掛着傳先生十年前的一張大照片，戎裝，說是在綏遠抗日的時候照的，我不會看相，但是感覺到是一種忠臣孝子的儀表。使人敬慕之心，油然而生。從我們誠懇而親切的談話裏，知道傅先生的夫人以前在綏遠的時候，在家裏還紡綫織布，現在在重慶，兒女在續書，傳公子心想買一輛心愛的腳踏車，終因無現款，而被旁人買去了！</p>
<p>堂北像一個門房</p>
<p>傳先生在家裏常說：「我們應該跟普通老百姓一樣。」要是不聽他的話，他就會嚷起來。</p>
<p>當我把副長官（記者按：卽指西北軍政副長官兼靑海省主席馬步芳氏）向太夫人禀安的話以及副長官歡迎他們到靑海住家的話說了以後，老太太是顯得非常的欣慰。她再三　我們吃一碟水菓和一碟落花生。</p>
<p>辭退以後，在大門口遇到傳先生的堂弟，在未介韶以前，我還以爲是一個們房呢！</p>
<p>一種深刻的對照</p>
<p>在歸途中，我是深深地被這次的訪問所感動着，傅先生如此的英雄豪傑，爲什麼會失敗呢？難道這是天地之問的公理嗎？許多要人的寶眷，在平日養尊處優，在緊急的時候都一飛了事，連洋狗洋貓都伴着飛去，而傳先生的家屬獨往西北，往大後方搬，傳先生還對他們說過：『頂好是你們都到西寗去，到馬主席那裏。」這是一種何等深刻的對照！</p>
<p>中　不需要豪門，更不需要官僚，中匯廣大窮苦的人民迫切的需要這種像傅先生一樣的人來作爲他們的公僕，自命爲人民的公僕的人們，爲什麼不倣效傳先生如此的精神呢？我是不是能學到傅先生這種淸高磊落的精神呢？我沉思着，我惶恐着，同時我更想到我的部下，我的同事，會不會倣效傅先生這種偉人的作風呢？我更沉思着，我更惶恐着。</p>

<h3>川局動盪之謠</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都二日航訊〕二月成都，錦江春暖，正是大好風光，平靜的錦城社會，突然被外來謠傳，吹縐一池漣漪：據說港穗一帶，紛傳「蓉郊形勢緊張，戰機一觸卽發」，但居住在這裏的人們，的確絲毫不曾嗅到一點戰事氣息。謠播之來，事感離奇，探究脈絡，當係由省政當局，加强佈防應變，軍運調動頻繁，引起意外誤會，事實眞像，容有報導必要。</p>
<p>謠言傳播　川政漣漪</p>
<p>近月以來，蓉郊兵運頗多，原因是去今兩年度的川省征召新兵，部份正在繳解，部份從事訓練，各地調動，事所難免。同時川軍管區奉國防部令，抽調保安團新兵若于，赴陝西補充胡宗南部隊；胡部爲凖備緊急應變，疏散軍眷入川，川陝道上，輸運絡繹，沿路各縣，人口頻增，一般遂謠傳，陝軍正源源南下，企圖撤退入川。恰逢西康劉文輝部廿四軍，原駐薪津雙流的兩個團，奉命移調成都武侯祠。王陵基時正赴渝謁張羣述職，蓉市發現以川保安團鄒瀾等六團長名義聯合反王的傳單，頓引起社會臆測，認爲：王劉之間發生罅隙，康軍入川用意顯圖推翻王氏。又值陸軍軍官學校廿三期學生畢業，在蓉郊舉行野外演習，車轔轔，馬蕭蕭，頻添緊張氣氛，有這二椿偶然事件的匯流，東南一帶遂傳播川局動盪的謠言，再傳播進四川，眞令身在局中的成都市民，感到惝恍迷離。</p>
<p>張羣返蓉　局勢澄清</p>
<p>謠言傳播，當然對目前團結應變的全局，易啓不良影響。於是張岳軍特提前偕王陵基來蓉，訪晤川康將領，共商團結大計；張於上月十四日飛到成都，留蓉三日，遍訪社會耆宿，並與劉文輝，王續緒，王陵基等數度懇談。同時出席省參會，立監國代聯合歡迎會，一再强調川康一家，必需精誠團結，方克善應變局，經過這一番坦白會晤，川局混沌的謠傳，爲之澈底澄淸。及張偕王返，劉文輝向傳義等復聯袂赴渝參加張氏就職盛典，川康將星，雲集陪都，歡敘一堂，情緒融治，事實推翻外來離奇神話。張就職以後，更召開西南五省市重要會議，對當前西南整個政治，經濟，防務間題，擬就全盤革興計劃，並把這方案帶去南京。王劉鄧（錫侯）則偕同返蓉，分別執行任務，一片祥和，象徵川康合作，共建西南的光明近景。</p>
<p>川陜協防　未具體化</p>
<p>關於陝軍入川，本來川陝聯防，醞釀已久，兩省唇齒相依，自來關係密切。最近大局演變，蜀隴猶如川康，兄弟一家，理無軫域。上次王陵基與胡宗南同在京出席軍政會議，對聯防具體計劃，雖作初步研討，卽就萬一局勢急轉，胡軍協防四川，彼此交換意見。月來，胡軍眷屬源源南下，川陝沿綫各縣城，充滿疏散人羣，一般遂以爲係胡軍入川先聲。因之在川省社會引起相當波瀾。大部份川人認爲，目前川省正在編練新軍，並展開自衛組訓，力量足以自衛，不必鄰省入援。在省參會歡迎張羣茶會席上，多數省參議員均主張，當前情勢，和戰未決，胡軍實無入川必要，應請當局婉予謝却。同時胡宗南近亦專函川省參會向傳義議長，邀赴西安，一商聯防間題。迄到今天，川陝聯防除邊境攻防合作，設防各縣劃入聯防區，統一軍事指揮外；兩省協防的整個計劃，尚待切實商討，胡軍並無入川跡象。胡部向成都進兵之說，更是接近神話　總之，春季川局，確在醞釀變化，但醞釀目標則是謀更堅定，更團結的統一應變。因爲大局若此，欲圖分裂割據，終將招致敗亡，在人民力量下，任何大胆軍閥，誰也不敢冒天下之大不韙。</p>

<h3>物價加速上漲　現鈔籌碼不敷週轉　本票支票滿街飛市民深感不便</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕物價接連飛漲後，市上現鈔緊勢有增無已。中央銀行雖已發行五百元及一千元之大鈔，惟發出者仍不多。而一般市塲，因買賣價格日見砌高，現鈔不敷週轉之餘，又紛紛乞靈於支票及行莊本票，故日來又見本票支票滿街飛之現象。三四日來票據交換所每日交換張數，已將接近四十萬張，較數日前突增一倍，交換總金額日來每日平均在八九百億元之譜，較三四日前增加約五成。惟退票數字，以銀根趨勢尚屬平穩，未見有顯著之增加。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕由於千元大鈔迄未發行，連日市上現銷籌碼極度缺乏。一般行莊支付現鈔限制甚嚴，若干行莊甚至對一萬元左右之票據，亦概發本票，致本票滿天飛現象，再度發生。市民均深感不便。據國行發行局負責方面談稱，市上現鈔恐慌現象，當局極爲關注，五百元鈔連日巳酌量搭發流通，至千元鈔，今後將視事實需要，陸續搭付。惟迄昨日爲止，尚未發行云。</p>
<h3>頭寸供應寬裕　銀根穩後轉弛</h3>
<p>昨晨本市銀根，走勢先穩後弛。晨起各業日拆利息，在七十元左右做開。因時屆週末，缺單者均提前於十時左右，向外搜求，多單者亦持觀望態度，故走勢尚稱平穩。惟迄十一時許，頭寸供應寬裕，多單者紛求拆出，暗息乃見下降，普通在六十元左右有做開，一度且曾見五十五元低價。近午因物價漲風動起，求單者又轉踴躍，做價乃告回升至六十至六十五元間。各業市塲利息，平均在六十元左右有做開。僅食米，麵粉等做價蛟低，在五十至五十五元間。人絲則做五十五元至六十元，證交貼息開五十三至五十八元。國行利息不動。</p>
<h3>滬國庫局辦理　金價兌付手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃自國行國庫局獲悉：民國三十八年黃金公債第一期債票第一次還本抽籤共抽籤五支，其中籤號碼爲一零，四二，伍一，七入，九六，依照該債票發售換票及還付本息辦法規定，已於三月三日開始辦理兌付手續。所有上項中籤號碼之債票及到期息票，均暫由上海該局辦理兌付云。</p>
<h3>行莊銀元存款　實施困難頗多</h3>
<p>關於本市金融業籌辦銀元存款事金融管理局方面對此舉認爲果眞實施後前途難望樂觀。據該局負責人分析其原由有二，（一）行莊舉辦銀元放款，在平時經濟穩定之時，銀元放款之辦理，原無問題。惟在物價波動過多之今日，則風險過多，放出後恐收回困難，且可影響行莊營業前途，（二）銀元存款舉辦後，估計其存放利率，僅能在二分左右。在市塲利率高昂之今日，此項低利，爲存放者所不歡迎。且無法作短期日拆。在此情形下，銀元有款，是否實施問題，困難頗多。又悉銀元存款之記賬方式，金管局方面認爲可記作「實物賬」，絕不得以銀元爲記賑單位，仍需以金圓券爲記賬單位。</p>
<h3>行局繼續差出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨繼續差出一六〇二二萬元，大交換各行差入八二二一九入萬元，洋商各行差入一四四二一萬元元，小交換各行差出八〇七一七萬元。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆·大戶抬　華股幾演滿堂紅</h3>
<p>昨日華股，展開極猛烈之漲風，近午幾告滿堂紅，僅動興衫襪及台灣糖業等有限幾種，未登漲限。昨日圈中銀根頗鬆，日拆最高僅做六角，近午五角有拆出。圈中大户力抬永紗及美亞以至漲限，小型股登漲限者，超出以前所有之最高紀錄。永紗開盤卽見高揚，做四元五角三分，開後一路高檔盤旋，曾二度接近漲限。一五六號全力反空，量低曾做四元四角八分，十一時左右證券帶一〇七號一路高抬，散户紛跟進，十一時五十分遂登四元九角之漲停板。美亞趨勢亦見一路高俏，初開一元八角，一度曾隨圈外金價小至一元七角七分，散户逢低有進，午時因業外金價上揚，證券帮一路高抬，直登一元九角三分之漲停板。台糖曾二度登限，終因星期日一天利息所限，紛紛拋售，下瀉至三萬元收盤。小股漲停者，共計華新水泥四角三分，振華油漆二元五角一分，閘北水電一元二角，華豐搪瓷二元〇六分，中法藥房八角二分，新亞藥廠一元七角四分，恒豐一元二角六分，信和一元六角三分，景綸一元六角二分，新華百貨一元二角四分，新光四角六分，商務，大中華火柴，永安公司，景綸等十五種。半日成交共三十八億另九百七十五萬股，內永紗一億五千二百七十萬股。</p>
<p>黃金公債市况，初價十六萬一千五百元，卽做十六萬五千元，升至十七萬元，盤住甚久。又低至十六萬五千元，最後收盤爲十六萬八千元，計起落幅度爲八千五百元。比上日計續漲八千六百元，成交共做二百三十六兩。</p>
<p>台糖可出　分割收據</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕證交以台糖公司股票成交單位，定爲十股。而該公司在市塲流通之股票，其面額頗多在十股以上者，交判割多困難。爰經徵得該公司同意，凡面額十股以上之股票於交割時，由該所暫行出給分割收據。俟將原股票向該公司掉換小額股票後，通知憑據掉換股票。該項分割辦法定本月七日起開始辦理。所有該所代辦分割手續，應付該公司掉票費及過戶費等，每張暫收六百元。嗣後該公司調整費額時，該項費用亦將隨時調整云。</p>
<p>永安紗廠　墾發股息</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕永安紡織公司董事會頃決議於本月十四日起，熱發三十七年份股利，計週息一分，按照股本額法幣折合金圓券，此外並加派棉紗贈品，按十四日之棉紗市價代爲估出應得棉紗贈品之價款，計算分派之。惟以後股東領受贈品，不諭何時，均以該估定之價格作準，不因紗價之漲跌而變更。</p>
<p>又證交昨爲此特於市塲公告，該公司之股份，自本月十二日起，開做除息除權之交易云。</p>
<h3>燃料問題嚴重</h3>
<p>關於本市整個燃料問題，頃巳面臨嚴重階段。非但存底日見稀少，抑且來源仍未見暢旺。市上做價迄朱見下沉跡象。煤球價格又因原料昂貴，成本不敷，日昨起巳作開年以來第五次的開整，竟由四二〇〇元一担疾漲至七〇〇〇元。據有關係人士稱：各負實機關前會一再努力採辦，甚或籌商縮减用途，卒以各產煤地區情形複雜，或遭戰事損燬，一時不克出貨。兼又運輸困難，致各路來源終未如期復原云。</p>
<h3>國行收購美鈔　改善收兌辦法</h3>
<p>中央銀行收購美鈔，雖每日提高掛牌，但因牌價與市價相差仍遠，故請兌者爲數寥寥。現該行爲求顧全實際計，昨特暫時停止掛牌，改變收購辦法，委託中國交通兩銀行根據前一日之外匯移轉證價格收購。昨日收購之價格，每美元爲三千七百元云。</p>
<h3>國行調整人事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行爲調整各地分行主管，已將西安分行經理潘益民，調充杭州分行經理，遺缺由該分行副理甘豫昌接充，至杭州分行原任經理張忍甫，則予退職。又南昌分行經理陳錫楨內調，另派謝建華接充。至昆明分行經理武鏞，因偽鈔案發生時，應付未當，已予撤職，派趙康節接充云。</p>
<h3>內匯率調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局內匯率，目七日起調整如次：廣州，二五〇元（原二百元），汕頭，海口，湛江，及廣東區其他各地均四百元（原三五〇元），長沙衡陽均二百元（原三百元），漢口武昌均二百元（原三百元），南昌一五田元（原二百元），溫州二百元（原三百元），靑島二五〇元（原三百元），安徽區除蕪湖安慶外，其他各地二五〇元（原一五〇元）。</p>
<h3>茶市明平暗漲</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，續呈靜中帶堅之勢，緣因時值週末，加以各項花色，自婺屯各路到貨斂跡後，而目前浙江等地之貨雖有到滬，但在陳茶存底空虛，距離產新期，尚屬有特中，執貨者乃一味守售，不允輕脫，是以買戶卽有悅胃，殊難得逞，交易因此奇懈，過程遂告步挺。價格方面，則以貨品關係，卒未顯著進展，均稱明平暗漲。</p>
<h3>絲綢飛升</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况帶息盤升，市上銀根轉鬆，業內暗息做六十元六十五元，晨開時間圈外黃金走勢尚平，且開後卽見軟弱，人心尚平。</p>
<p>120號天橋晨開下星期一頭寸爲一〇六萬一〇七萬，開後走勢尚穩，在一一〇萬左右盤旋，十一時後聞黃金市價高升，業外紗布上揚，人心轉堅，市勢直綫上升，高至一二二萬午收。午後因週六塲內無市，塲外聞黃金做價猛升，市勢仍挺，喊價瘋狂，惟無正式成交。</p>
<p>生絲昨市外匯證市無榮辱，初開時人心尚平，優級零担先見一三五萬元喊開，中間趨勢尚穩，嗣後業外金價報漲，棉紗激烈上揚，本街納胃轉旺，人心趨倘，市况極挺，午收時高至一五二萬。午後因黃金再度猛升，市勢跟俏，喊價又爲二十萬左右。</p>
<p>綢緞昨市走勢盤旋，晨開迄收市，漲跌幅度距離尚近，市勢尚平。美亞被面初做六七萬元，中途因暗息仍高，浮散戶脫貨放息，塲上供售尚旺，市勢微見軟弱，一度回小五千元，低後聞華股多種漲停，黃金迫近二二萬，人心突俏，塲上貢氣卽旺，喊價卽高，近午以六入萬五千元收市，續升二萬餘元。午後因生絲人絲隨金價猛漲影響，人心亦頗俏利，美亞喊七四萬七五萬賣出。</p>
<h3>食米暴漲　特主粳創二萬四千六新價　粉糧食油等行市一致狂跳</h3>
<p>食米漲勢飛黃騰達，因昨爲週六，付款相隔二天利息甚鉅，貨主乃亦扳高加升，加以人心緊俏，進戶甚多，北市塲白粳高達二萬三千四百元，狂漲三千入百元，特高粳二萬四千六百元，均猛升二成。南市塲上漲較緩，白粳二萬二千二百元，約升二千入百至三千元，二市到貨登記共六千四百〇入石。市勢突飛猛晋，緣因週一期款關係，貨主扳持頗力，且米價暴漲，人心亦昂，開市老車卽破萬關，收市高達萬零六百元。兵船初開激挺千餘元，中市大戶力吸，一度猛叩萬關，收市略低，以九千九百入十元成交，收市後散戶俠然活躍，市勢重叩萬關，大發高做萬元，後市喊價達萬〇三百元。麩皮客帮猛吸，激挺一成半，大包登七千八百元高峯。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>展開張風，黃豆以油餅激升，廠胃特濃，漢口車豆猛漲四千元，高做二萬一千五百元，冬豆桑園豆普挺二成，生仁上漲較爲緩和，揚州生仁砌高一成，昨叩二萬關，苞米紅糧去銷有限，上漲不多。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>漲勢如火如茶，初以米價上漲，人心堅昂，貨主扳價殊力，價提升一萬元，後更買氣濃厚，價再狂漲，豆油終漲一萬入千元，高至九萬四千元，生菜油九萬元，吉桶生油出十萬大關，最後竟至十一萬（靑島）猛漲二萬元，豆餅亦升二成。</p>
<h3>桐油喊高</h3>
<p>桐油昨市，開後卽因人心昂俏，趨勢鋒芒畢露，霎那間，更聞金融性各物與業外物品，一致晋達高峯，執戶亦追隨高喊，致漲風不可收拾，以迄收市，一致續升二千至五千元不等，底盤至爲鞏固，前途俠然看俏。</p>
<h3>中信局積極推動　對英鎊集團貿易</h3>
<p>組織審議會負責審定一切</p>
<p>政府爲推廣英鎊集團國家貿易，經政院核定原則，次第實施。中信局曾奉令邀集工商部，外交部，財政部，資源委員會，中央銀行，輸管會等有關機關舉行會議，商討有關英鎊集團國家貿易問題。對於貿易對象，及貿易物資，與貿易金額，均有決定。第一步暫定爲五十萬英鎊，以英·澳·印·巴基斯坦·新西蘭·馬來羣島·荷印·緬甸等國先行試辦。貿易物資，輸出爲棉紗，生絲，茶，猪鬃。轍入物資爲米，麥，棉花，羊毛，樹膠，蔴袋，機器及肥料等。據中信局易貨處經理鄧飛談：關於英鎊集團國家之貿易事宜，正積極進行中。輸出入物資，我方已開列淸單，正由工商外交兩部向英鎊集團國家交換意見。如獲同意，卽可簽訂合約，進行正式交易。中信局方面，係代政府辦理，一切均奉上峯指示進行。據悉此次貿易仍採易貨方式，該局已擬定辦法十一項，根據事實地而要，決組織英鎊集團國家易貨審議委員會，由局長副局長及局內有關各處生管人員，並聘請財政，工商，外交，等三部長及輸管會養源委員會，中央銀行，全國工商協會，上海市進出口會各派代表一人參加。局長爲召集人，所有易貨對象國家，貿易限額，輸出入物資種類價格等，均由審議會審定。又據另悉，中信局爲把握出口貿易物資，將視需要生產集中地點預爲收購，或與各地素著信譽之廠商合作購製。易回物資，在政府物資調配會全盤計劃之下，隨時供應市塲出售。易貨所發生之盈虧，槪歸國庫。收購輸出物資及物資輸入應繳墊款，則由中信局估計數額呈政院核定後，在中央銀行開立對英鎊集團國家收購輸出入物資成本長戶，隨時由中信局支用。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>據輸管會息，下週（三月七日至十土豆日）出口限價，與上週相同，並無變動。</p>
<p>皮貨羊毛交易在擯持之中，本叩日新盛等洋行因國外覆電尚未抵達，交易冷落。惟執貨者因業外物價上漲，亦鮮肯低價脫售</p>
<h3>市塲散步　看台客</h3>
<p>午後颶風到全市又瘋狂　南洋先以風銀元當首衝</p>
<p>大鈔發行日起，人心一致看漲，金融當局拋外匯移轉證，不惜高抬利息，捏緊銀根，才造成了目前市塲上的變態心理。</p>
<p>過去數天，物價無日不漲。但賣出的雖覺賣價賤，把貨款放出收拆息，又覺不無補益。買進的雖覺不如放息，但進價不嫌貴，看遠一點，更覺得便宜</p>
<p>買賣雙方，都在這矛盾心理中忐忑。因而市塲空氣，一反日前的興奮，而呈萎靡不振之態。</p>
<p>昨天市面，除了股市幾乎滿堂紅，各市仍舊不死不活。可是午後三時左右，風潮突起，金鈔銀元領首暴漲，一般商品市價，也絡續加碼，但大家不知听漲何來？</p>
<p>市塲裏誠然有關軍事謠傳，但忖忖太不像眞。此刻翻檢外電，恍然此次漲風，來自港方，亦與吾人連日所談英美問金融戰爭局勢有關。</p>
<p>美國反對南非抬價售金，刻正採行種種積極措置，在他勢力圈內，至今尚未黃金進出口的地方，正先後實行管理。</p>
<p>菲列賓原是黃金自由進出口岸，此間條子來自香港者多，香港條子來自菲列賓者多，菲列賓來自澳洲和南美等地。前天起，菲列賓政府突然下令管理黃金貿易，今後黃金進出菲島，均須經政府許可。</p>
<p>此舉顯由美國策動，用意有二種可能：（一）防止美國圈內存金，因歐洲各地金價上漲，陸續流出，而影響美國爲世界有金最多之地位。（二）美國或有提高金價可能，故不得不事先管制出口，以减損失。　菲島管制黃金貿易的消息，傳到香港，香港金價，卽從三〇四元激漲爲昨晨三〇七元多。</p>
<p>另一個原因，就是美國明白拒絕中國的白銀貸款要求，道一消息，早報都有發表。股市最敏感，深知自銀借款失望，金圓券及財政金融的轉機希望更鮮，因此有十六種股票漲停板，接着就把影響波及全市了。當然，袁頭首當其衝，但銀元黃牛的消息究屬慢，常識究屬淺；所以漲風仍由金鈔領導了，但展望下週，如有特殊變化，袁頭或尚有更新演出，亦未可知。</p>
<h3>紗價猛烈上揚　棉布堅檔盤旋</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，漲風加甚，蓋銀根步鬆，人心浮動，投機氣氛濃厚，各方羣趨購吸，各紗登峯造極，飛漲中再出現新高價。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳晨開一百四十七萬元，最後竟升達一百五十四萬元，較前猛挺三十萬元之鉅。四〇支金城跳二十三萬元，以一百五十萬元收市。三二支銀月叩破一百萬元大關，爲一百十四萬元，激挺二十三萬元。</p>
<p>一一支雙馬現貨由七十入萬元直跳至九十萬元大關站定，終高二十萬〇五千元，廠單現出做八十四萬元，二〇支雙馬創入十三萬元新高峯，其他金城與天女等俱在入十萬元至八十五萬元間做開，十六支光明接近八十萬元，以七十七萬元結局。</p>
<p>布市向榮，晨初以本街去化尚暢，開盤卽昂，臨收散多需單者套售不乏，市微見回落。午後聞黑赤猛烈上揚，人心大爲振奮。塲外買聲極盛，行情再見激挺，</p>
<p>能頭細布自三萬一千五百元步漲至三萬二千爲最高，臨收因淨多略有脫手，價乃迂迥下降，終以三萬一千元收市，軋升二千二百元，下午在三萬七千五百元有成交。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰初以二萬九千五百元一路盤小至二萬入千四百元，最後爲二萬九千一百元，軋漲一千九百元。午後初喊三萬一千五百元，最高達三萬六千五百元，嗣後步退至三萬五千元。一九〇高檔士林叩七萬元大關，此外色布與花布俱見新高。</p>
<h3>呢絨春銷發動</h3>
<p>毛織品呢絨嗶嘰昨市傷上躉交轉盛，同業中向中信局及中紡開求者見夥，一般掮客跑街，往來莫不忙碌，蓋因各區西服時裝帮及呢絨洋貨舖子，春銷咸皆發動，十餘萬元一襲西裝，五萬餘元一件抱料，均有定製剪銷。同時南京方面人心轉安，銷路進展，商號多添貨復業，呢絨各貨腳地均頗堅挺，業中人無不扳硬樂觀。</p>

<p>第一塲職業拳擊賽後，我淨到手五十二元。這還是塲壓軕賽。在六個月職業賽中，十塲我以擊倒人家稱勝，二塲以積點判決獲勝。漸漸地我體重也增加了。一九三五年我出戰勃克漢的時候，體重已增加到一百九十四磅。在我第二次擊敗拉梅李之後，我的名字和照中在所有的報章上出現了。他們替我加上了「褐色轟炸機」的頭銜。許多拳擊賽的主催者，都來跟我接頭，不過條件都恍惚的很。結果我跟麥克叔叔簽訂了合同。這是我開始謙大錢的先聲。在我繫敗萊寒洛一塲中，一次凈到手一萬二千元。那時離我轉入職業界後不過十個月。而大多數的拳擊手，須經積年出擊，才勉能一塲獲得一萬元。這時離我廿一歲的生日，才祇一個月。這年的復活節時，我替我的母親和口妹們，前後一共買了一一一幢房子。</p>
<p>一九三二五年，我到紐約楊基運動塲，和前軍量級冠軍卡納拉決戰。許多人希望我敗北，我一到運動塲時，許多照相機的閃光燈，幾更把我眼請也照花了。記者先生們問了許多話，我只能回答極少的一部份。有人說我很不高興的樣子。事實並非如此，這樣的塲面，對一個初出道的孩子，實在是太大而多餘的了。</p>
<p>有許多報紙說；當我在竿頭日出的時候，以及奪得錦標的時候，我週園正有許多黃牛包圍着。又對我的經理人和敎練等，不時飛短流長。然而，我的經理人和敎練等人，從未敎我放素任何一戰，我認爲他們確是腳路實地的做事。同時，在我週圍的人，我確有我所能信任的人。例如專管票務的龔士，他就是個撿定會計師。我的法律顧問傑勃笙，他是陸軍部長的平民副官。道些人都有崇高的名譽，他們爲我管理一切事務。</p>
<p>當我們對卡納拉之戰準備就緒後，紐約的許多地痞流氓，就想向我們開「條斧」。有的人也許接受下來，我們却自己請好了警察，把這批東西推之門外。六月廿五日興卡納拉對壘之晚，眞是我有生以來各戰中記憶得最淸楚的一晚。那晚我一切都很正常。卡納拉想把他的體電來嚇退我。在第四回合中，我們正扭作一起時，他曾想利用他的體重來攻擊我，但我却比他先出一手，很淸晰的把他摔開。那時我只見他下顎垂開，一臉孔的怪腔，因爲以前從沒有人這樣摔過他。在他嘴尚未閉攏之前，我又一拳擊中他的頭部，他眼請裏驀地變得亮晶晶的。第六回合中，我又擊中他的下顎，他一下子摔倒在地上。他雖慢慢地和蹣跚地站起來，可是經不起在左手一鈎，右手一拳直中腦鬥，他又跌倒了，這次不再能爬得起來。那晚血戰結果，我凈得六萬元！</p>
<p>這次以後，他們又替我找培爾對壘，這時候培爾的重量級錦標，才被白萊道克奪去不久。在對培爾之戰揭幕前數小時，我跟支加哥一個速記員叫瑪芙的結婚。瑪芙當晚看我擊敗培爾。（按：喬路易和瑪芙現在已經第二次離婚了）。</p>
<p>可是，逆運來了。一九三六年六月間，在紐約楊基運動塲和許墨林的第一戰，他把我吃　，幾乎把我在拳壞上巳有的成就，一筆鈎銷！那時我還不足廿二歲。我想這是我遭遇最壞的一晚了，這是我最想忘去的一椿事！事前我預算應該很容易的贏此一仗，不料事與願違。許墨林右手的一拳殺手鐧，簡直把我的下顎都給搗碎了，我一下子就摔倒在地。他右面出手的幾下硬拳，常常命中我的面部，把我面孔打得血肉淋漓，後來連視綫都糢糊了。這是我有生各戰中所僅遭遇到的一次，但是他一直同我　戰到第十二回合中，才算把我解決了。</p>
<p>同年八九兩月間，我先後擊敗沙　和艾托兩人。然而記者先生們還想許墨林巳澈頭澈尾的把我打垮了，其實他們是錯的。我有充分的戰塲經驗，來估計每個對手的意向，我仍有十足的自信。那時，我的經理人想約許　林再作第二次的對壘，許加以拒絕。最後還是麥克叔叔想出主意，跟我約定了那時的世界重量級冠軍白萊道克一決雌雄。道塲決戰的日子，定在九三七年六月廿日。</p>
<p>白萊道克眞是個殺坯，打得一手硬拳，他跟我鏖戰時間之長，業已超出了我的預算。我本打算在第五回合中可以把他解決掉，那知六回合，七回合的連下去，直到第八回合，他的變臂和雙腿，才完全失去了控制，我拚足全身的力氣，揮出去結結實實的一拳，命中了他的右臉，他立刻應聲面向下的直撲而倒，這下子我就搶到了世界重量級的拳擊錦標！</p>
<p>當我爲凖備應付對許墨林的第二戰，而積極苦練的時候，我微聞許墨林曾對人說：日耳曼人是個優越的種族，他將從拳擊裏證實此說。跟許墨林決戰之晚，我一切都凖備齊全。我左手一拳方出，右手一拳又緊接着命中他的下顎，他窮於招架，我施展了我混身的解數，一拳把他摔倒在塲邊的繩圈上，他的雙膝給拗曲下來，我一手又把他抓離繩圈，又是一下老拳，命中他的肚子，他一聲慘叫，我在腦子裏自忖：「這一下子滋珠如何，自命的優種先生！」接連着我又命中他身上和臉顎各緊要關口多次，他第一次摔倒不久又爬起來，經不起我左拳一鈎，右拳一揮，又告墮地。當他剛爬離地面，我一拳致命的打擊，又命中他的下新，這次摔倒不再爬得起來了。但是，後來許墨林在德國對人說，他遭敗北的原因，是因爲我犯了規。這是我討厭許墨林的另一個原因。拍出來的電影明明證實了我並未犯規，然而這些電影，始終沒有在德國上映過。</p>

<h3>全英羽毛男子單打　黃德福決戰費禮門　半決中黃現順力戰失利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日電：馬華冠軍黃德福頃以十五對六，十五對五痛擊美國選手洛夫台，將在決賽中再與十年來未逢敵手之費禮門決雌雄。</p>
<p>黃炳順因臂傷未愈，在半決賽中被費醴門擊敗。比數爲十五對二，十五對四。但賽來十分精彩緊張。絕非如比數所顯示之一面倒。費禮門身手矯捷，抽手不爽分毫，所失六分，俱係被黃炳順在綱前接連以砲彈式高壓猛殺，非人力所能挽回。</p>
<p>黃德福以超羣卓越之演出迫使洛夫台在廿六分鐘內屈服。今夕塲內冷氣逼人，此來自溫帶之馬來選手賽初顯受重大影響，第一局一度以二比六屈居下風。但此後卽見恢復常態，以連珠式猛擘連得十入點。洛夫台爲之一籌莫展。</p>

<h3>市長盃足球賽　爆出冷門　二年盟主大意大荊州　哀兵哀將中航勝青白　殷慶炳最後一脚頓使大局面目全非</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市長杯足球複賽，昨日突出一大冷門，冠軍可無問題之靑白，竟被中航以二比一淘汰，中航獲決賽擢。靑白已通勝市長杯二屆，此第三屆之勝利，遂告中斷。銀杯易主，殊出千餘球迷意料之外。上半時中航以一比零佔先。中航於上塲十分鐘高秀淸獲中第一球後，靑白反攻，終無效果。下半時靑日破釜沉舟，攻勢雖盛，奈不得其門而入。近千球迷已爲靑白担憂，直至最後十分鐘，才由金祿生打中一球，扳成平手。此時觀衆咸以結果將成和局，延長時問，不料臨了二分鐘，中航殷慶炳一冲，靑白之門又破，二年盟主，竟告慘敗</p>
<p>靑白之敗，是上塲輕敵，以爲可操必勝，及局勢打悶，巳經力不從心，態打愈悶走頭無路。隊負失常，都是沒精打彩，鬆弛異常。守衛太差，後防漏洞大開，中衛綫如同虛設，前鋒後衛切成二段。前鋒减色，射門頭頂都顯不出顏色。角球十四五次之多，竟一隻都未曾開花。反觀中航，以必敗之師，努力作戰，是共得勝所在。雖云有幸有不幸，也要看自已力也。</p>
<p>球證倪孝本鳴笛開賽，中航哀師出戰，高秀淸殷慶炳聯袂進犯。殷帶球直入腹地，妙傳小高，近門處低射入網，一比零先聲奪人。靑白不防有此一失，努力反攻，劉體寅迫近低射，爲徐福生接住，劉隆馨地頂，亦告越出。卅三分鐘時，小羅廿碼反身力射，中柱彈出，恰中徐福生肩上，徐輕舒　臂，正好接着，上半時中航淨勝一球。</p>
<p>易邊後，靑白倍見努力，小顧劉隆馨劉體寅互易位置，但仍無濟於事，中航門俞佈下堅强工事，靑白前鋒未帶射門鞋來，至此却步，雙方鏖戰甚久，直至卅三分鐘，三毛帶球遠出，傳向左方，伏迺堂傳小羅，球從柱上彈回，金祿生近門力射入網，扳成和局。終塲前一分鐘，小高派司殷慶炳，沿邊直入，越過三毛一關，射入網底，中航遂以此一球徼悻淘汰老盟主靑白。</p>

<h3>賽後小評</h3>
<p>本屆市長盃冷門疊出，龍頭被志超淘汰於先，靑白又這中航毒手於後，互相輝映成趣。</p>
<p>逸園塲上空曠非凡，近千觀衆點綴其間，倍見冷落凄慘。</p>
<p>中航以哀師出戰，不求勝利，但求少輸，結果意外得嘗甜杯，球運固有關係，徐福生演出意外精彩，高秀淸復出統率三軍，陳效平拔刀相助亦不無裨益也。</p>
<p>靑白演出本季來最劣之一塲，前勢忘帶射門鞋子，各個間格格不入，小羅被陣效平釘煞，金祿生不逮平日永凖，而自阿福豹隱，小費去港後，鋒終實力，大打折扣，劉體寅任翼鋒，每喜多盤，小顧無傳中之腳頭，右翼有才難之嘆。</p>
<p>假使今日鐵路志超之戰，再出冷門，看中航志超奪市長盃，則眞是冷門中之冷門了。</p>
<p>足球水凖日見低落，昨賽拖泥帶水，全無精彩，觀衆裏足不前，平心而論，正像一幕幼級盃賽。</p>
<p>勝利後足委會接辦球賽，第一屆成續尚稱不惡，嗣後則每况愈下，豈絢爛之極，歸於平淡乎？</p>
<p>靑白除孟義良外，其餘爲淸一色小將，恍如上屆靑白白化身，看來阿奎還須多下些功夫。</p>
<p>三毛演出不弱，坐鎭後防，好比長江天塹，但最後所負一球，未能勾銷於前，眞是白璧中之玷小球。（史公）</p>

<p>女子（四）　第二循環黎隊約翰先行接觸，鮮紅色的球衣成了歷年來約翰傳統的標幟，黎隊的淡黃，愈襯托出醒目豔麗，約翰張羅羅在入塲替補時和對方握手的微笑態度，令人有輕快之感，亦可以說是「先禮後兵」的表示。第一節黎隊十四比六領前，黎隊前鋒三人小巧玲瓏，守將對之　　痛目眩，上半時成廿六比十七，錢家姊妹楚屏幽屏一對小辦子，擺動愈凶，得分愈多，約翰林靜怡在第二第三兩節中，有奮鬥精神。第三節成四二比廿五。突節黎隊以勝算已操，調動繁忙，有</p>

<h3>粉筆生涯</h3>
<p>— 林西</p>
<p>說到教書，人總稱贊它說是「淸高」。但我們敎着　的人，却覺得並不是因爲了淸高，才來做這個工作的。老實說，「淸高」還不是一句空話，值得什麼？我想，一個人如果能甘心情願地做着一個工作，而並不想離開，這原因大體的必可分爲兩類，一是因爲興趣，一是因爲名利。然則，自然有人要問了：敎書可有點什麼興趣或者名利可言呢？滿身的粉筆灰，聲嘶力竭，日復一日，年復一年，到頭來又熬不到一個官做，弄不到一文錢賺，這個行業可有些什麼興趣可言呢？</p>
<p>這實在是很不容易用一句話來回答的，且讓我從遠虎說起。</p>
<p>個人天生來一切心靈的活動，就是要求着兩個方面的，一方面是受的，一方面是給的。人一天天地讀着書，接觸到許多思想，許多問題，漸漸地，這些一東西在你裏而混和，變化，發酵，漲大，你感覺到好像有一些東西時時要從你的裏面衝出來，你覺得需要人知道。同情·辯難，或者甚至反對也好。總之，你是想望情一種向外的宣洩。</p>
<p>我們平時不覺得，其實，人多多少少都是在想望蒲一種宣洩的。有人願意自己賠了本辦雜誌，有人到處投稿，有的人情願犧牲了性命，爲的要爭這點可以讓大家有什麼話便向人說的權利（名之日言論自由）。而在西洋，儘有很多人用盡各種方法去競選做個議員，只不過爲了要能有一個機會自己站起來說話，呌千把人坐着聽的。如果有人到過倫敦的海德公園看看，這情形就更可了然了。</p>
<p>然而這一切的路，沒有比敎書更直接，更容易，也更澈底可靠的了。寫文章是一件繞彎兒的事情，在心理上也就像是一個人自言自語一樣，難有那種可以使自己相信的反應；而向人演說呢，那是常有被噓下來而弄到面紅耳赤的危險的；就是和朋友談天罷，不知道你有沒有過這種不愉快的經騐：當你正滔滔不絕說得得意時，你却發現有兩個朋友已經在爐邊睡着，而另一個則打了個呵欠說：「啊，我們來談些別的罷。」</p>
<p>只有在講台上，你是可以想說什麼就說什麼的，而且時時都有機會·你有學問，可以說出來；你有牢騷，可以說出來；你可以稱讚一個失敗的英雄，也可以駡盡了古今天下的一切人物。而且，只要你留心看，可以見底下那一片尚未失去眞純的年輕的臉龐，張大着眼睛，那樣熱心又那樣敬崇地望着你，聽着你的每一個字。除了在講台上，你是決不會有第二個這樣的機會的。朋友們是找不到那麼多的；羣衆是不會有這樣能了解的。你感覺到那些壓在你心頭的話在不停地向外流，你每一刻都在感覺着那種難言的的舒放。</p>
<p>我自己記得有一次，正偶然提到一個比較難於說明的人生底思想，我看見許多深思苦索的臉在我的下面，我把目光偶然移回來時，正見前面的一排，有一張臉上驟然流露出了那麼一個了悟的，感應的微笑。這剎那，我覺得我就像是在茫茫人海中突然地找到了一個知己一樣。</p>
<p>要找一個地方，能有那麼多的人來傾聽你的話，而且總是那樣的注意，那樣的同情，又那樣的尊崇的，除了這裏，講台上，怕再沒有別的地方了。只有在這裏，你是可以充分地享受着這種快樂的、</p>
<p>而同時，我也知道自已是在做着一個對人類的生存所需要的事業。我們實在並不是因爲了「淸高」才來做這個工作的·卽使明天大家都公認了敎響是世界上最最下流的職業，恐怕我也還是會甘願來度這粉筆生涯的罷。</p>

<h3>美國狗的消耗</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>貓和狗是家畜中最普通的兩種，西洋人對於狗的愛好，比貓更甚，在美國，平均一百家人家，有五十七家養貓或狗，或兩種都養。全美國所養狗的總數，約在二千萬頭左右。</p>
<p>美國人養狗，是把狗當作玩物，飼養得十分豐厚·因此那二千萬隻狗的每年消耗，也是一個很大的數字。單就食料一項來說，去上一年的消耗，就達一億二千萬美元。至於用在狗身上的全部消耗，全年估計總在七百五十億美元左右。</p>
<p>狗的消耗旣如此可觀，許多商人，也就動狗的腦筋，專門來推銷狗的用品，諸如房屋。食物·藥品·衣着·等等，市塲上都有出售·還有訓練狗的學校，爲狗治療疾病的醫院，整理狗毛的理髮所等等，眞是設想週到，無微不至·好得一般狗的主人，大都是有錢的大爺小姐，用點錢不在乎，所以專做狗生意的商人，也就無不利市十倍了。</p>
<p>十年以前，還有人發起了「狗週」，從此有了一年一度專爲狗而設的季節·在最初，參加的祗有五百個團體，去年已增加到三千個·還有一本養狗的手冊出版，現在已出到第四版，每版五千冊，在兩個月裏，兩萬本書一銷而空。去年起，還設置了狗的「諾貝淾獎金」，計二千美金，獎給一年中對狗的健康和福利最有買獻的人。</p>
<p>各地還有許多狗的墓地·一般狗的主人，不僅對於愛犬的生前，愛護備至，就是等牠歸西以後，還不忍其暴露屍骨，不惜重金爲其覓一長眠之地。在約紐長島，有一個五千多穴的狗公墓，各墓穴上，都堅着大理石碑。其中最講究的一個，葬着一頭叫做「帕瑪蘭琳」的狗，墓地價值在一千美金之上。</p>
<p>寗爲太平犬，莫作離亂人·看到美國狗的席豐履厚，轉看我們橋邊巷口那些乞兒丐婦的可憐相，眞使入興人不如狗之感了。</p>

<p>一走進電梯，我就注意到那個開電梯的人僅有一隻手，他的左手從手腕起截斷了。我向他說，這是否有許多不便呢。他回答說：「沒有甚麼，已經慣了，只有我在想穿引綫時才想到它。</p>
<p>顯然的，並不單是環境使人快樂或愁喪。我們的情緒，是由我們對環境的反應所決定的。每個人都能戰勝不幸和逆境，－如果我們必須戰勝，否則就是滅亡。我們目己有時也許不相信，但每個人都擁有無比的潛力，足以克服艱困。我們實在比我們自已所想像的更堅强，只要能不屈不折，發揮自己的潛力。</p>

<h3>美國片與英國片</h3>
<p>— 王冊</p>
<p>上海的觀衆常常浸潤在好萊塢男女紅星的羅曼斯與桃色歌舞聲中，它們很少有健康，有生氣的作品。卽使爲上海靑年男女所傾倒的「戰地鐘聲」，好萊塢劇作家也抹煞了西班牙革命戰爭的意義，而替西班牙反法西斯戰火上，撒上一重美國式的愛情之網。卡萊古柏與英格蘭褒曼的「纏綿悱惻」，與美國大學敎授的「義勇雙全」，果然可以「奪人心魄」，但是把西班牙革命的重點，放在美國式的個人英雄主義上，也約略可以看出好萊塢的旨趣所在了。</p>
<p>而英國影片，最近則比較的能把握住一個正確的主題，寫出這個社會發展的形態。比如被人冷落的「功名塵世」，它寫一個畢生從事於勞工運動的工人，他很受人民的歡迎，但他有一夭離開人民，而接受了朝廷的勞工大臣以後，就被人民所拋棄了。全片的對照很强烈，意義極深沉。英國影片如若能把握住製片方針，它是可以爭取好萊塢影片的觀衆的。</p>
<p>好萊塢不是沒有好影片，但那正是：「寥若晨星，歷歷可數。」</p>

<h3>上海舊話之二　上海第一家小菜塲</h3>
<p>— 古齊</p>
<p>今日上海，規模像樣的小菜塲已到處皆是。但在五十年前，却還沒有什麼規定的小菜塲，各街各巷，都有零零碎碎的小菜交易，至於行販的批發之所，則是在山西路盆湯弄。那裏也沒有塲所的建造，只在街路兩旁擺設攤基，有點和現在河南路寗波路每日下午的菜市相仿。當時，四馬路的老巡捕房，還在前盆湯弄絲業會館的地方，菜販或因無執照，或因「孝敬」不足，常常被租界時代的巡捕老爺抓進「行」裏去，手打腳踢，菜蔬也遭沒收，苦不堪言。而如果逢到風雪大雨，在露天交易，買賣兩方更都感不便，而又無可奈何。當時有商人楊子京，見了這種情形，五思改善，便斥資在五福衖蓋了一所蘆蓆的小菜塲，略可避避風雨，菜販都集中在那裏交易，當時人都稱之爲東荒塲菜塲。後來市面漸漸興盛，滬上人口亦漸漸增多，工部局決定要再建一座大規模的小菜塲，便向楊子京員下了前鐵房十小菜塲的基地，用木板蓋成一座大規模的菜塲，每機收月捐一元。後來因爲木板易遭風雨侵蝕，又改爲鐵皮，攤捐也增加到兩元至三元。到民國十多年，鐵房子小菜塲的基地賣出，才遷到福州路小菜塲。至今，福州路小菜塲仍是批發行情的產生地。</p>
<p>且說盆湯弄時代的小菜塲，價格還以制錢爲單位，昨日偶翻閱五十年前舊報，見有當時菜價，且隨便抄錄幾樣：柴五十文一百斤，荳油三十六文一斤，燒餅三文兩個，鷄蛋四文一枚，肉五十六文一斤，魚二十文一尾，粗布三百文一疋。</p>
<p>今日鷄蛋近金圓百圓一枚，金圓百圓卽法幣三億元，合制錢須九千億文之多。如此一算，眞是恍同隔世了。</p>

<h3>Arrangement Phase of the Peace Negotiation's Main Proposal: The Military Seeks Reasonable Equality; No Preconceived Notions Regarding the Constitution, Legal System, or Coalition Government; Ten-Member Committee to Hold Final Discussions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 5th] The government's side is actively researching the peace negotiation proposal with the Communists, and preliminary opinions have been obtained on the most difficult issue of reorganizing the military. It is reported that the ten key members responsible for drafting the proposal have met several times in recent days. The method of their meetings involves each of the ten members providing their individual opinions and counter-proposals regarding the eight conditions proposed by the Communists. These are recorded one by one, then organized, summarized, and compiled into a complete set of opinions. A proposal will then be drafted based on these opinions. Liu Fei and Zhong Tianxin have been appointed to be in charge of the recording and organization work during the discussions. Premier Sun, in order to expedite the process, has obtained approval from Acting President Li to invite Wu Jingxiong and Gan Jiehou to assist. Wu and Gan have been permitted to attend the past several meetings as observers. Currently, the opinions of the ten key members have all been presented. Liu, Zhong, Wu, and Gan are engrossed in the work of organizing and summarizing, which is expected to be completed in two or three days. At that time, the ten key members will hold another meeting to discuss in detail. A reporter inquired with highly reliable authoritative sources on the evening of the 5th and learned that the opinions of the ten key members presiding over the peace talks are largely the same. They believe that although the issue of war criminals appears to be extremely important on the surface, it may actually have a role in (bargaining), and there will still be opportunities for negotiation in the future. Regarding the constitution, legal system, and coalition government, the government side has no preconceived notions, but must insist on striving for the people's freedom of life. The government side has also considered land reform and the confiscation of bureaucratic capital, but unfortunately, it has not been thoroughly implemented. There is no major contradiction between the government and the Communists on these points; however, the reorganization of the military is the most difficult of the practical issues. The source revealed that the military reorganization plan negotiated between the Kuomintang and the Communists in 1946 was an important reference for the ten key members during their research, but due to the passage of time, many aspects are no longer suitable. Some people believe that the most appropriate solution is "separate governance," but this approach is unlikely to pass and will probably not be proposed. Several key members advocate that the handling of the forces of both sides should be based on the principle of "from reorganization to unified organization." The so-called "reorganization" means that both sides will independently reorganize, reduce, and downsize all of their forces to the minimum, as the current national wealth and people's strength do not allow for the constant maintenance of millions of troops by the people. The so-called "unified organization" means that after both sides have completed their own reorganization, they will then be unified and become the national armed forces. The source pointed out that whether it is reorganization or unified organization, it is neither the five-to-one method of the Political Consultative Conference era, where the Communist army is incorporated into the National army, nor the Fu Zuoyi-style reorganization, where the National army is incorporated into the Communist army, but is based on the principle of reasonable equality and unified organization. As for the ratio, it is not intended to be stipulated, and will be left to be decided during formal negotiations between the two sides. Regarding the military reorganization issue, in addition to the opinions expressed by the ten key members, Liu Fei has also been designated to be responsible for discussing with military personnel separately and listening to the opinions of military leaders. The plan they propose will then be used as a reference for the ten-member committee's discussions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 5th] Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang and Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong convened a meeting at the Ministry of National Defense on the morning of the 5th to discuss the issue of downsizing the National army, inviting military and political leaders from various regions who had arrived in the capital, as well as those in charge of the Ministry of National Defense.

<p>"President Zhesheng Jian, Minister Zhong arrived in Shanghai and received a great demonstration, which is very grateful. Shun and others came to Beijing yesterday, and silently observed the current situation. I feel that there is nothing to do and nothing to say. If the government does not make the greatest determination to reform thoroughly, I am afraid that it will not be able to save the lost hearts of the people. Therefore, I still earnestly ask you to relieve Shun of his duties during the reorganization to clarify responsibilities and reduce offenses. I pray for your understanding and luck. Zuo Shunsheng·Lin Keji, March 5, 38th year".</p>

<h3>HSBC Chairman Morse on the Situation in China</h3>
<p>[Reuters Hong Kong, 5th] HSBC Chairman Morse delivered a speech at the bank's annual shareholders meeting today, stating: Since foreign merchants set foot on Chinese soil, the situation in China has not been more unfavorable to foreign merchants than it is today. However, he also does not believe that Chinese and foreign merchants with business experience on the Chinese coast will be discouraged by this. Both the Chinese government and Communist Party leaders are determined to industrialize China, so foreign machinery and investment are still necessary for China. He feels that China's current development is not entirely due to corruption and mismanagement, but because the government has been too slow to address the needs of farmers. Therefore, the centuries-old history of China seems to be a continuous performance of peasant rebellions, which today tends towards the Communist line.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou Shipping and Seafarers Associations Oppose Opening of Wuzhou; Telegraphed the Executive Yuan to Request Revocation</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Bureau, 5th] The Guangzhou Shipping and Seafarers Associations recently telegraphed the Executive Yuan on the issue of opening Wuzhou as a foreign trade port, requesting revocation of the decision. The original telegram stated: Wuzhou is located in the hinterland of South China, far from the coast, and there is really no need to set up customs and become a foreign trade port. This move undoubtedly repeats the mistakes of the Qing Dynasty, damages the country's inland waterway rights, hits state-owned enterprises, and affects people's lives.</p>
<p>[Reuters Guangzhou, 5th] Most Chinese shipping companies here feel uneasy after the Chinese government opened Wuzhou as a foreign trade port and allowed foreign ships to dock, fearing that Hong Kong shipping organizations will invade the Xijiang River and cause ships traveling between Wuzhou and Guangzhou to suffer. At present, only tugboats travel between Xicheng. After the opening, Hong Kong steamers can directly reach Wuzhou, and passengers and cargo will inevitably flock to them.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Province Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement Term is Said to be 50 Years</h3>
<p>[United Press City News] According to Nanjing news: Zhang Zhizhong, Chief of Northwest Military and Political Affairs, suggested giving the Soviet Union exclusive rights to the province's trade and aviation for a term of 50 years, which was opposed by other government personnel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a revision: first, shorten the term of the new Soviet agreement; second, replace the Soviet Union's patents with the most-favored-nation clause. The most-favored-nation clause is applied to this agreement, meaning that China hopes that the Soviet Union and other countries considered to be the most-favored-nation will enjoy the same rights in the new province. According to the usual diplomatic customs, all contracting countries can actually be regarded as quantum-favored nations, so the significance of this article is no different from implementing an open-door policy in Xinjiang Province. Although Zhang went south, his representative is still in Dihua to contact Soviet personnel, instead of being presided over by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese government formally notified the Soviet Union last September that it intended to abolish the Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement, but according to Central News Agency news, five Soviet representatives have arrived in the capital of Xinjiang Province, not only to discuss the conclusion of a new civil aviation agreement, but also to address broader issues, such as the relationship between Xinjiang and the Soviet Siberian republics. In addition, the negotiators on both sides may also discuss the continuous conflicts between various ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The previous rumors that the Soviet Union would obtain exclusive rights to exploit Xinjiang's minerals have been denied by Zhang.</p>

<h3>Star Weekly Forum: An Attempt at a New Printing Method</h3>
<p>— Shi Rong</p>
<p>—One of the Printing Reports from the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Science Journal Association—</p>
<p>Printing is fundamentally a crucial tool for culture. Not only should the application procedures be simple and convenient, but the costs should also be low and economical. This way, it can be supplied to society for widespread adoption, achieving the goal of disseminating culture and promoting progress. In any country where letters form words, its printing method has been changed from manual typesetting to machine typesetting, such as Linotype. Machine typesetting only requires the original manuscript to be typed once with a special typewriter. Then, all the lead characters are cast and arranged. After another step of plate arrangement to properly arrange the layout, plates can be made and printed, which is quite simple and convenient. Moreover, since there are not many letters to use, it is easy to train skilled workers to become specialists. Not only that, but the lead characters retrieved by the Linotype typewriter have fewer manual errors, making proofreading easier to say the least.</p>
<p>Judging from Chinese characters, about 3,000 characters are commonly used. If rare characters are included, there are no less than 6,000 characters. When typesetting and printing are required, not only is a lot of equipment needed, but also, due to the inability to use machines for character retrieval and arrangement, and the excessive number of character types, many errors can easily occur, not to mention the considerable time spent on arrangement and proofreading. Furthermore, if the text includes mathematical formulas or chemical structural formulas, the typesetting procedure is even more complicated, which is beyond the capabilities of ordinary printing companies.</p>
<p>All the inherent defects in Chinese printing are well known, and research and improvement are urgently needed. Although I, as the publisher of "Modern Railway" magazine, have little research on printing technology, I still hope that those engaged in culture will actively improve it. Therefore, I changed to using a Chinese typewriter to first type the manuscript, then used photographic reduction, and finally used rubber plate printing. After several months of research and improvement, fortunately, I have achieved preliminary success. As the Chinese Science Journal Association is holding its second annual meeting, I am submitting a report on the process of improving the printing method for reference. Moreover, although this preliminary achievement is still far from ideal and cannot be regarded as a final conclusion, the matter concerns the key tool for opening up culture, so I dare not keep it secret. I would be very grateful if printing experts would give guidance and even conduct joint research!</p>
<p>It is found that the original manuscript for phototypesetting must have uniform ink color, and the thickness of the strokes must be consistent, especially if there are missing strokes, which is not allowed. Otherwise, the photographed negative will be difficult to be clear and pleasing to the eye. Therefore, the text of ordinary photographic rubber plates must first be typeset with lead characters and then phototypeset to obtain a complete typeface. This procedure is very uneconomical. The ordinary use of this method is only when there are copperplate pictures, and a small amount of explanatory text is attached below. Because the area occupied is not large, it is adopted to save the cost of copperplate. As for other text printing, it is limited to letterpress printing, and there are not many who use this method.</p>
<p>"Modern Railway" magazine, in order to improve the printing method, once adopted this method to type the manuscript with a typewriter. During the initial experiments, the typed characters had extremely uneven ink color. If black carbon paper was used instead of ink, the strokes were not very clear. If enlarged and examined in detail, each stroke was blurred with ink on both sides, which was not pleasing to the eye. After several studies, very thin paper was used. Black ink was used on the front, and black carbon paper was lined on the back. Then the typed characters were more uniform in color and could be barely used. The recent issues of "Modern Railway" magazine have adopted this method to first make a manuscript before rubber plate printing.</p>
<p>It is also found that the typefaces in Chinese typewriters only have one type, while typesetting manuscripts must use various sizes and styles of typefaces to meet the needs. To solve this difficulty, "Modern Railway" magazine used typewriters for the main text, while the titles, headings, and other special typefaces were written manually in various graphic typefaces and supplemented. Fortunately, these specially made typefaces are not common in the manuscript, and it is also easier to write large typefaces. Although the typewriter typeface only has one size, it can be reduced to a certain expected size by photography. According to the past experience of "Modern Railway" magazine, it is very satisfactory and without difficulty to reduce the original text to between No. 5 and No. 6 size characters. It is not very suitable to enlarge or reduce it too much. In short, typefaces with a size of about No. 5 or No. 6 can be used for any magazine.</p>
<p>In Chinese typewriters, there is no way to solve the problem of inserting numerical formulas or chemical equations. In this case, one can only rely on manual writing and insert it into the main text. If you are in the general engineering profession, it is not difficult to write typefaces or formulas with graphic typefaces. Those with a little experience can cope with it easily. Therefore, there is actually no difficulty in supplementing the various typefaces mentioned above.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the calculation methods for printing costs, letterpress printing and photographic rubber plates are different and must be compared individually to understand. Compared with the cost of typesetting and casting zinc or copper plates, the former is indeed cheaper, but the labor cost of printing with rubber plates is more expensive. This fact is even more obvious when quoting a small number. Also, when letterpress printing encounters horizontal typesetting, tables, or mathematical formulas, additional costs are required according to the regulations. If there are copper and zinc plates in the text, in addition to the cost of making the plates themselves, the space occupied still needs to be calculated as typesetting labor, which is not cost-effective. Using the "Modern Railway" magazine method, when printing horizontal rows or tables and mathematical formulas, the printing cost is equal to that of vertical lines, and the increase in cost is not too much. Moreover, direct photography by this method eliminates the cost of making copper and zinc plates, which is even more considerable.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, compared with the overall cost, the various costs required for photographic rubber plates are far cheaper than letterpress printing. "Modern Railway" magazine has benefited greatly since trying this method.</p>
<p>What's more, "Modern Railway" magazine does not consider itself an inventor by adopting this method, because similar methods have long existed in European and American countries. For example, the Vari-Typer typewriter currently sold in European and American markets can type various types of typefaces. It uses specially made thin paper and colored ribbons and is typed by electric methods. The typefaces are uniform and the strokes are clear and bright. The printed products are comparable to letterpress printing, which can be called perfect. Currently, general Chinese typewriters in China have too many shortcomings, so the typing results are difficult to be satisfactory. However, after the initial attempt by "Modern Railway" magazine, a satisfactory result has been obtained. It is still hoped that publishers will promote it together, study it in detail, and obtain more advanced results. If electric typewriters are launched in the future and supplied at low prices (Gao Zhongqin has already produced them, and Lin Yutang has also successfully tested them in the United States), the typing results should be improved, which is predictable.</p>
<p>Due to the initial attempt of "Modern Railway" magazine, not only is it considering economic aspects, but it also hopes to lead to another path in terms of using the spirit of research, and to make a new reform in China's printing methods. This humble intention still hopes that all publishing experts will work together to achieve success.</p>
<p>At present, China's printing industry, Shanghai is second to none. Not only is the equipment substantial, but also the technology is excellent, and the products are perfect. In the mainland, it is currently impossible to hope to be comparable to Shanghai. However, if you want to obtain excellent printing, you can still use the above method, first submit the manuscript for typing and finishing, and then mail it to Shanghai for printing, which is very convenient.</p>
<h3>Improving the Treatment of Public Education Personnel: Restoring the Method of Monthly Adjustment, Determining Standards Based on the Cost of Living Index for the Current Month; Approved by the Executive Yuan's Temporary Political Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The method for improving the treatment adjustment of public education personnel proposed by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has been approved at today's temporary political affairs meeting of the Executive Yuan. Starting from March of this year, the method of monthly adjustment based on the cost of living index standards in various regions will be restored, and a portion of the allowance will be prepaid at the beginning of each month according to the supply standards of the previous month. However, the calculation method of the salary base will be changed from the original 40% for the base of 60 yuan and above to 300 yuan, and 20% for the base of 300 yuan and above, to 20% for the base of 60 yuan and above to 300 yuan, and 10% for the base of 300 yuan and above. The new adjustment method is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Starting from March of this year, the treatment of public education personnel will be adjusted according to the cost of living index of civil servants in various regions for the current month; (2) The base number in the salary is 60 yuan, and the part above the base number is 20% for 60 yuan to 300 yuan, and 10% for 300 yuan to 7; (3) At the end of each month, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics shall formulate a regional adjustment supply standard table based on the cost of living index of civil servants obtained from the survey and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation; (4) At the beginning of each month, the salary of employees of various agencies shall be prepaid according to the supply standard of the previous month. After the adjustment plan is approved at the end of the month, the increased portion will be paid retroactively. If there is an overdraft, it will be deducted from the prepaid amount in the next month; (5) In March, the salary of employees of various agencies shall be prepaid three times the supply standard of February. After the adjustment plan is approved at the end of the month, the refund will be made according to the previous article; (6) The annual fee and public fee of legislators and supervisors and the public fee of people at all levels will be adjusted accordingly and calculated according to the standards of the government's location.</p>
<p>According to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the treatment of public education personnel is adjusted monthly in accordance with the regional verification standards of the cost of living index in various regions, which has been implemented for a long time and has been gradually improved. Until the currency system was reformed in July of last year, and price limits were implemented, salaries and wages were frozen, and the adjustment method was abolished. Later, prices gradually rose, and employees' lives could not be maintained. Referring to past methods, three adjustments were made one after another from November of last year. However, due to the government's economic situation, on the one hand, it is necessary to consider technical issues such as the calculation of payment and receipt, and on the other hand, the results obtained from the regional formulation of standards are inevitably different from the actual situation in various regions, especially when prices fluctuate drastically; After detailed research, the Ministry believes that the method revised in June and July last year, which adjusts treatment according to the index of the current month, is closer to reality, and the prepayment of a portion of the salary at the beginning of each month also has a great impact on employees' lives. The Ministry has put forward improvement opinions on both adjustment methods and payment.</p>
<h3>Sudden Increase in National Treasury Expenditure: Decision to Reduce Military and Political Spending</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] According to a certain financial official, on the 5th, he told reporters: The implementation of the public education personnel treatment adjustment method passed by the Executive Yuan on the 5th has resulted in a sudden increase in national treasury expenditure by several times, which is an excessive burden. However, the adjustment of the treatment of civil and military public education personnel is due to the government's decision to reform politics. In the political reform plan, some unnecessary agencies and redundant personnel will be eliminated separately, and all institutions will be simplified to strengthen work efficiency, so as to save expenses and reduce the burden on the national treasury. The most difficult thing is the issue of military expenditure. The military personnel, including soldiers, account for a large proportion of the military pay item. When discussing the treatment issue at the political affairs meeting on the 5th, there were many concerns about this. President Sun Ke previously advocated reducing the number of officers and soldiers to 550,000, but in fact it still exceeded the actual number, and the national treasury could not afford it. Therefore, the financial authorities still insisted on reducing it to save the amount and transfer it to increase treatment needs; The Ministry of National Defense also had many difficulties due to the limitations of the facts. After Minister Xu Kan and Minister Xu Yongchang discussed the results in detail at the meeting on the 5th and after the meeting, it was decided to approve the number of 4.2 million people. Although the number reduced was not very large, it was not a small help to the national treasury. As for the reduction and tightening of various institutions in the political aspect, it has not yet been implemented. If it can be done in accordance with the reform plan, although the treatment of public education personnel has increased several times, the actual increased expenditure will be reduced proportionally. In addition, the government's tax revenue will increase by one example, and the national treasury revenue and expenditure should not be too large.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Managers Transferred in Xi'an, Hangzhou, and Other Places</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sanshi News] The National Bank has transferred the heads of various local branches, and Pan Yimin, manager of the Xi'an Branch, has been transferred to fill the position of manager of the Hangzhou Branch.

In addition, Chen Xizhen, manager of the Nanchang Branch, has been transferred internally, and Xie Jianhua has been assigned to fill the position. As for Wu Yong, the manager of the Kunming Branch, he has been dismissed for improper handling when the counterfeit currency case occurred, and Zhao Kangjie has been assigned to fill the position.</p>
<h3>Agreed on the Amount of Military Expenditure: Xu and Xu Yongchang Discussed the Results, Still Based on 4.2 Million People as the Standard</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The issue of the amount of military expenditure in March was first brought up for discussion at the political affairs meeting on the 5th. The Ministry of National Defense still insisted that the minimum number of troops should be 4.2 million, and the military expenditure in March should still be supplied according to this standard. The heads of the Ministry of Finance, Food, and Budget insisted on further reducing it. After much discussion, no conclusion was reached until the meeting adjourned. After the meeting, Xu Kan and Xu Yongchang studied it again and agreed to supply it according to 4.2 million people.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Issuance of Silver Dollars: The Amount Has Not Been Determined</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The issue of issuing silver dollars to military personnel and soldiers was also discussed at the meeting on the 5th.

<p>[Our newspaper, Changsha, 5th] Zu Mo'an solemnly denied that Wai Fuqu would resign due to the Xiangxi incident. The rebellious people trapped in Yuanling are still wantonly slandering Li. Yesterday, they even telegraphed Tang Boqiu, the chairman of the Provincial Congress here, and Senator He Sanchang in the name of "Xiangxi Incident Will Compel the Committee," saying that Li "used his special service regiment to enter Yuan City, resisting the army on one side and looting Yuan City on the other, which was unbearable. The chairman turned to detain him." Li is still staying in Chang, emphasizing a political solution, but he must first recover Yuanling. Dai Jitao and Chen Jingwu, who were ordered to go to Xiangxi for mediation, have arrived in Chang, and will try to communicate with Zou Hai, the leader of the rebellious people in Yuan (former secretary of the District Commissioner's Office). Zou said that he would order the troops attacking Changtao to stop their activities, and said that they did not commit any crimes after being trapped in Yuan and welcomed the mediation personnel to visit Yuan for inspection. Zai and his party of five departed from Chang by special car of the 17th Pacification Area on the morning of the 5th.

The main entrance was closed, and hundreds of audience members all escaped from the Taiping Gate. Except for a small number of women and children who were injured, there were no deaths. After the firefighters and police worked hard to rescue, the fire was brought under control and did not spread to nearby houses.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Communist Party Wants to "Revolutionize" to the End: The Central Plains Communist Army Enters a Training Boom; The Communist Party Accuses the National Army of Reorganizing New Troops</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The Xinhua News Agency in northern Shaanxi broadcast the day before yesterday. The Beijing news reported that Ye Jianying, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, attended the "National Student Congress" convened in Ping on March 1 and said, "The PLA has destroyed 5 million Kuomintang troops, and true people's peace is already possible. We must not only break the Kuomintang's false peace, but also carry out the revolution to the end."</p>
<p>Also, the Xinhua News Agency in northern Shaanxi broadcasted on the 5th, a message from the Central Plains on the 3rd: The various departments of the Central Plains Field Army have now mostly entered a training boom. All the troops that have completed political mobilization and ideological preparation have entered a training boom. The soldiers practiced bridging, boarding and disembarking, and making straw sandals. The cooks practiced cooking rice. All cadres and soldiers are striving to complete the training plan. Prepare to meet "new tasks".</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] The Communist Party Radio broadcast on the 5th, with the title "Pay Attention to the Conspiracy of the National Faction to Deploy a New War", commenting on the current situation, referring to the reorganization of new troops, US aid to continue to aid China, and carrying out open war mobilization. It is one of the tactics used by the Chinese Communist Party to deploy troops north of the Yangtze River to exert military pressure on peace talks. Observers believe that although peace talks are about to begin, there may still be some bloody incidents during the start of the peace talks and the negotiation period. The Communist Party Radio's current rhetoric on the preparation of the government army is the prelude to the Communist army's desire to use military force to cooperate with the peace talks.</p>

<h3>Molotov and Mikoyan Dismissed, Vyshinsky Appointed Soviet Foreign Minister, Menshikov Succeeds as Minister of Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>[Associated Press London Dispatch, 4th] Moscow Radio announced on the 4th that Molotov, who has been the Soviet Foreign Minister for ten years, and Mikoyan, the Minister of Foreign Trade, have been dismissed. The broadcast stated that Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has succeeded Molotov. This is the biggest change in the Soviet cabinet since the war. According to the broadcast, "The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has decided to approve Comrade Molotov's dismissal from the concurrent position of Foreign Minister and to appoint Comrade Vyshinsky as Foreign Minister. Comrade Mikoyan, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, has been approved to be dismissed from the concurrent position of Minister of Foreign Trade, and Comrade Menshikov has been appointed as Minister of Foreign Trade." Molotov's rank is second only to Premier Stalin. Before the war, Molotov was the Premier of the Soviet Union. Molotov succeeded Litvinov as Foreign Minister in 1939. In 1941, when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Stalin became Premier. [Associated Press London Dispatch, 4th] Western diplomats, upon hearing that Vyshinsky, who has repeatedly exaggerated his influence in international conferences, has replaced the thoughtful Molotov as Soviet Foreign Minister, immediately raised a question: "What will the Kremlin do now?" Is Stalin preparing to retire and delegate power to his most trusted comrade, Molotov, to be responsible for the Soviet Communist Party Politburo, or is Stalin preparing for another twist in his ever-changing foreign policy? Obviously, Molotov remains Deputy Premier (Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers), so there is no doubt that Mr. Molotov continues to be the most powerful figure in Soviet politics after Stalin. But since the Soviet Union last changed its foreign minister, no action has attracted as much attention from the West as this one, and in the last change, Molotov replaced the great friend of the West, Litvinov, and in this change, neither Molotov nor his loyal deputy, Vyshinsky, can be called friends of the West, so the motives are even more unclear. Westerners believe that Vyshinsky's succession as Foreign Minister shows that the Soviet Union will adopt a tough attitude towards the West because Vyshinsky has always appeared as a red figure in previous international conferences. Therefore, if the Kremlin is planning a tough policy towards the West, Vyshinsky is the most ideal person to implement it, but Vyshinsky's power is probably only in execution. At the same time, if Stalin plans to give Molotov greater powers, Vyshinsky, with his many years as Deputy Foreign Minister, is certainly the most suitable successor. If this speculation is true, then this change is just a change of roles and will continue the same policy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Prague Dispatch, 4th] Vyshinsky has returned to Moscow after visiting the famous Czech resort of Karlsbad for several weeks. It is said that Mr. Vyshinsky arrived here last month for recuperation, and it is generally believed that Mr. Vyshinsky met with several foreign Communist Party leaders, including the leader of the German Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Future Trend of Soviet Diplomacy: Washington Maintains a Wait-and-See Attitude, Believes There is No Hope for Improvement in US-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch, 5th] Foreign policy officials and members of Congress today speculated about Vyshinsky's succession as Foreign Minister, but there was no consensus. Some said this was a dangerous move in the Cold War between East and West, others said the Soviet Union would adopt a softer attitude towards Western countries, and others said it was just a normal political transfer. But everyone agreed that only by waiting for future developments can the situation be clarified.</p>
<p>President Truman, Secretary of State Acheson, former Secretary of State Marshall, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Connally, and former Chairman Vandenberg all declined to comment. Senator Smith, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that the Soviet Union would take some drastic action, possibly military action against Norway and Denmark. The Soviet Union's policy has become tougher due to the situation in China and other places. Congressman Richards, a Democrat, believes that the new action will go in one of two directions: either tougher on the United States or improved relations with the United States. Republican Senator Ferguson said that there is no hope for improved international relations in the future, and they may worsen. Vyshinsky's anti-American rhetoric has always been more intense than Molotov's. It is still remembered that when Molotov succeeded Litvinov as Foreign Minister, it was widely believed that the Soviet Union could be friendlier to Western Europe and the United States. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union suddenly signed a non-aggression treaty with Nazi Germany before World War II.</p>
<h3>Mikoyan's Dismissal Particularly Emphasized by Britain and France</h3>
<p>Considered an Omen of Intensified Cold War</p>
<p>[Associated Press London Dispatch, 5th] The British Foreign Office received a "urgent report" from Ambassador Peterson to the Soviet Union on the 5th, which stated that Molotov's departure was a promotion rather than a demotion. British Foreign Office officials believe that this announcement has been overemphasized and warned against overemphasizing the transfer. French sources believe that Mikoyan's dismissal as Minister of Trade is more important and more ominous, because Mr. Mikoyan is the most Western-minded person in the inner circle of the Kremlin. Western European diplomats also know that this transfer may mean the continuation and even intensification of the struggle between East and West. Some Soviet experts even believe that Vyshinsky's replacement of Molotov as Foreign Minister may only be another transfer of important officials in preparation for Stalin's successor. No matter what the meaning of the sudden transfer, Molotov and Mikoyan are still members of the Soviet Politburo, while Vyshinsky and the new Minister of Trade Menshikov are not. The Politburo is the highest authority in the Soviet Union that makes real decisions.</p>
<h3>Only a Strategic Change, Not a Change of Policy</h3>
<p>Hint from the Czech Official</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 5th "Broadcast: Prague Dispatch, well-informed Czech sources said that the change of Soviet Foreign Minister may only be a change in diplomatic strategy and not a change in diplomatic policy. A Czech official said, "In the near future, Vyshinsky may be more suitable to implement foreign policy." The general Czech people were surprised by this news. Hungarian officials refused to comment on this, and this news was not even published in today's evening newspaper.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 5th] Political figures here said that the Soviet Union may now be preparing to formulate a plan aimed at consolidating its post-war gains in Eastern Europe, rather than expanding its control. But they stressed that if there is any change in Soviet policy, it will be in terms of strategy rather than objectives. They also warned not to think that the Soviet Union has abandoned its long-term plan to control the world.</p>
<h3>Vyshinsky's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>Soviet Union's new Foreign Minister Vyshinsky was born in 1883 in Odessa, Ukraine, and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Kiev University. In 1902, he joined the Social Democratic Party and engaged in revolutionary activities. In 1905, he worked in Baku, Caucasus, and was arrested and imprisoned several times. In 1923, he practiced law. In 1925, he became a law professor at Moscow University. From 1935, he served as a prosecutor. During the Soviet Purge, Vyshinsky was the prosecutor of the Purge Court, and his reputation rose from then on. In 1937, he was elected as the director of the Institute of Law of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In 1938, he was elected as the Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee, and later changed to the Deputy Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and represented at the Mediterranean Alliance Conference and the Paris Peace Conference. In 1946, the first session of the United Nations General Assembly was held in London, and he served as the chief representative of the Soviet delegation. Later, the United Nations General Assembly was held twice in New York, and he served as a representative. In 1947, he attended the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference with Molotov. He served as the chief representative of the Soviet Union at the Danube Conference. Vyshinsky is intelligent, capable, eloquent, and argued with Western diplomats at various international conferences. He was awarded the Order of Lenin three times in 1937, 1943 and 1945.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspapers Did Not Comment</h3>
<p>Only Published Brief News</p>
<p>[Associated Press Moscow Dispatch, 5th] Moscow newspapers on the 5th only published two brief pieces of news about the dismissal of Molotov and Mikoyan on the back page, each only 29 words long. No newspapers commented.</p>

<h3>Observations of United Nations General Public: Soviet Policy Will Not Change, Molotov's Dismissal is Actually a Sign of Promotion</h3>
<p>[United Press Success Lake Dispatch, 4th] When the news of the dismissal of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov came, the United Nations representatives here were all surprised. A diplomat commented that Molotov's dismissal was actually a sign of promotion, and Soviet policy would not change. Molotov is still the Deputy Prime Minister, and may replace Stalin as Prime Minister. Molotov's resignation as Foreign Minister can relieve some of the burden.</p>
<p>Other diplomats believe that it is not yet known whether Molotov will be promoted. Soviet experts initially heard the news of Molotov's resignation and believed that this was an attempt by the Soviet Union to befriend Western countries. When they heard that Mikoyan had resigned as Minister of Foreign Trade, they felt that there was no change in Soviet policy. Mr. Mikoyan is considered one of the most Western-friendly of the 14 members of the Soviet Politburo. The new Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will definitely continue the Cold War and intensify his attacks on the West. Mr. Vyshinsky did his best at the United Nations Paris General Assembly last autumn and obviously won the favor of Moscow authorities. Mr. Vyshinsky delivered many speeches at the meeting attacking the United States, Britain and France. The general public originally thought that Mr. Vyshinsky would re-appoint the head of the Soviet delegation at the United Nations New York General Assembly in April this year. After being promoted to Foreign Minister this time, it is speculated whether he will attend in person or let Deputy Foreign Minister Malik attend. Another Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko may make a comeback.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Tokyo Dispatch, 5th] U.S. diplomatic and military intelligence officials in Japan were all studying the news of Molotov's dismissal on the 5th to determine whether there were any signs of changes in Soviet Far East policy.

However, they pointed out that the diplomatic setbacks currently encountered by the Soviet Union in Europe may cause the Soviet Union to strengthen its Far East policy in order to regain its prestige.</p>

<p>[United Press London Dispatch, 4th] The diplomatic community here was greatly surprised to learn that Vyshinsky was appointed Foreign Minister, and speculated about the recent causes of this matter.

<p>[Associated Press London Dispatch, 5th] British newspapers on the 5th commented that the dismissal of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was the biggest change in Soviet policy since Litvinov was dismissed from the position of Foreign Minister in 1939.

<h3>Public Utility Rates Calculated in Customs Gold Units; Ministry of Finance Cables Shanghai Requesting Cessation; Mayor Explains This Was a Last Resort Measure</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The calculation of public utility fees in Shanghai in Customs Gold Units was not approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has cabled Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, pointing out that it is inappropriate to charge for public utilities in Customs Gold Units and requesting that it be stopped.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since public utilities in this city changed to Customs Gold Unit pricing, the general reaction has been one of feeling overwhelmed by the burden. All parties believe that Customs Gold Unit prices are linked to the US dollar, so changing public utility pricing to Customs Gold Unit pricing is tantamount to changing to US dollar pricing in disguise, which obviously undermines the value of the Gold Yuan. General business practices and the income of the salaried class are all based on the Gold Yuan, with the cost-of-living index serving as an indicator of the increase or decrease in the value of the Gold Yuan. It has not been heard that this indicator has been replaced by the Customs Gold Unit, and since public utilities can use the Customs Gold Unit as a pricing standard, other items such as rent and general prices will follow suit and change the pricing base, which will inevitably plunge the people's livelihood and the future of the Gold Yuan into despair.</p>
<p>Due to the public's opposition, Mayor Wu explained to reporters yesterday afternoon that the decision to take this measure was a last resort. He recounted the economic difficulties faced by various public utility companies, stating that: Because public utility costs are directly affected by rising foreign exchange rates, they often suffer from economic turnover issues. In February, an economic panic occurred three times, and loans totaling more than 800 million Gold Yuan were borrowed from the National Bank and the Central Bank to overcome the difficulties. The last time, the company had no money to pay employee salaries, and I personally requested a loan from President Liu of the National Bank. President Liu replied that he was unable to do so due to a shortage of cash. After I pleaded with him again and told him that various companies might face the risk of water and electricity cuts, President Liu tried his best to find a way to reluctantly lend more than 200 million Gold Yuan. Based on this experience, if the economic problems of public utilities themselves are not thoroughly resolved, it is expected that they will be unable to continue to operate this month. Moreover, since the government announced the new economic plan, resolving that the central government will no longer provide subsidies, the self-reliance of public utilities is now an immediate issue. Therefore, knowing that the implementation of the new adjustment plan would inevitably face criticism from all sectors, in order to maintain public utilities, this measure had to be taken.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also stated that although the pricing unit for public utilities is based on the Customs Gold Unit standard, it is actually based on the "August 19" base number of the Gold Yuan. When the government issued the Gold Yuan, it stipulated that four Gold Yuan were equal to one US dollar, which is one Gold Yuan equal to two and a half US cents. The current public utility unit uses this as the base number. Wu also stated that after the public utilities were adjusted using the Customs Gold Unit, most citizens were not affected. For example, stores and factories adjust their prices daily, so they can afford public utilities. As for the salaried class, if they are paid according to the cost-of-living index, there will be no disconnection, because the city government's statistics show that the rise in the cost-of-living index is balanced with foreign exchange rates. As for those most directly threatened by the adjustment of public utilities to the Customs Gold Unit, they are public school teachers. The city government is currently trying to provide employees with water and electricity subsidies to compensate for this.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Group of City Council to Hold Meeting to Study; Speaker Meets with Mayor and Also Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Speaker of the City Council Pan Gongzhan met with Mayor Wu at the City Hall at around 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss the pricing methods of public utilities. According to Speaker Pan's statement to reporters: Although adjusting the prices of public utilities is necessary, he personally opposes the settlement of standard units in Customs Gold Units. The Public Utilities Group of the City Council plans to convene a meeting to study the methods of adjusting the prices of public utilities and provide them to the City Hall for reference.</p>
<p>[Another Report] City Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan sent a letter to Mayor Wu to oppose the pricing of public utilities in Customs Gold Units, requesting him to withdraw his order. It is learned that Mayor Wu specifically invited Councilor Zhang to the City Hall for a talk yesterday, telling him that the City Hall approved the measure in order to maintain public utilities, hoping he would understand their difficulties. If there is a better way to solve the economic difficulties of public utilities, the City Hall will be willing to adopt improvements.</p>
<p>Labor Circles Express Protest</p>
<p>Since the prices of public utilities in this city have been charged according to Customs Gold Units, all sectors have expressed dissatisfaction, especially the workers in this city who feel that they cannot afford it. According to Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the General Labor Union, the adjustment of public utility prices this time is calculated in "Customs Gold Units," and the price changes daily, which is extremely unreasonable. He stated that the current rise in prices and the increase in the cost-of-living index mean that price adjustments are necessary, but this calculation method is actually leading to rising prices. Moreover, workers' income is in Gold Yuan, but payments need to be calculated by converting to Customs Gold Units, which affects the lives of workers. The General Labor Union has considered this issue and expresses its protest for the sake of the safety of the lives of workers throughout the city. It has been decided to request the relevant authorities to immediately stop charging fees according to this calculation method.</p>
<h3>Unit Discount Continues to Rise</h3>

<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Director Speaks; Payment Period for Water and Electricity Extended to Seven Days</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the criticism from all sectors regarding the Customs Gold Unit pricing of public utilities, the reporter visited Zhao Huijue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, at 5:00 PM yesterday to inquire about his views on this point. Director Zhao stated: The price of public utilities is based on Customs Gold Units in order to achieve the self-reliance of public utilities and has been done out of necessity. He stated: The City Hall has not forgotten the burden on citizens. In order to ensure that ordinary users are not affected by the Customs Gold Unit to Gold Yuan exchange rate adjustment, the Public Utilities Bureau has ordered Gu companies to extend the payment period for water and electricity to seven days. Each company should issue invoices within three days of meter reading, and users can pay within four days of receiving the invoice. The Public Utilities Bureau has also ordered the companies to base the exchange rate for payments within the time limit on the exchange rate on the date of meter reading, and only new exchange rates can be accepted after the deadline. In addition, the ordinary users mentioned above refer to users with a monthly consumption of less than 5,000 degrees in the Shanghai Electric Power Company area, less than 2,000 degrees in the French Zhabei and Pudong areas, less than 1,000 degrees in the Chinese business area, and less than 500 cubic meters of tap water (less than 300 cubic meters in the Pudong area). The Public Utilities Bureau also hopes that users can prepay so that they will not be affected by the Customs Gold Unit exchange rate adjustment.</p>

<h3>Commodity Tax Collection in Kind; Tobacco and Cotton Textile Industries Say They Cannot Afford It</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of commodity tax collection in kind, the tobacco and cotton textile industries have recently convened meetings of industry leaders. The results have been uniformly recognized as unbearable. Under the current environment, there is no guarantee for production and sales, and increasing the burden will inevitably lead the industry to a standstill. Therefore, they have also requested that the original system be maintained. Yesterday, it was rumored in the city that the financial authorities will take into account the practical difficulties in the implementation details of the financial plan that has not yet been announced, and will formulate practical, effective, and feasible regulations for stabilizing the economy and stabilizing people's livelihoods in order to promote them to the greatest extent possible. The reporter once again inquired with various relevant parties about the possible content of the implementation details, but the parties were very secretive and only said that the plan was still in Minister Xu's bag. As for the rumor that the gold and silver market will be restored on Monday, the parties were unable to confirm it.</p>

<h3>Inspection Tour of Pudong South Reveals People's Deep Suffering; Heavy Tax Burden; Rural Areas Have No Time to Breathe</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Pudong South" area includes Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui counties, and is bounded by the sea to the east, and is particularly closely related to this city. What is the recent trend in the area? The reporter went to inspect it yesterday and found a gratifying phenomenon, that is, the understanding and awareness of the local administrative staff of the necessary reforms in the current political situation has gradually become profound. The suffering of rural people in recent years has been increasing day by day. This kind of suffering is unimaginable for urban people. General local officials are at a loss in actual administrative experience, and they are gradually merging with the hopes of the people, and finally issue a call for political reform. Taking Fengxian County as an example, the county has a total population of only 240,000 people, but the burden of quotas is surprisingly heavy, such as the first phase of the conscription quota of 609 people, with a resettlement fee of 20 shi of white rice per person, totaling 12,000 shi; the supplementary levy of self-defense special donation of 25,000 shi in 37 years; the difference in non-staple food for the troops stationed in the territory requires 2,000 shi of rice per month; the construction of Pudong Avenue requires 3,000 shi of rice; this alone has made the current rural families of four or five people unable to breathe. On the one hand, the county government strictly urges collection, moving east to make up for the west, in order to cope with the supervision and payment of the superiors, but its own office expenses for all personnel are only more than 600 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Local Cadres Should Be Immediately Rectified and Trained</p>
<p>When the reporter met with Chen Xuan (see photo), the commander of the Su Southern, Sha, Hai, and Feng joint defense area, he said that improving the quality of the troops should first improve the treatment, so why not coordinate the resettlement fee and implement conscription? He also lamented the low efficiency of local administration, the corruption and incompetence of township chiefs, the county-level personnel accustomed to waiting for orders, with no construction concept, and the provincial-level and above authorities unable to deeply penetrate the countryside to find a cure. So the top and bottom only rely on a piece of official document to contact, and the situation will only get worse over time. He suggested that local cadres should be immediately rectified and trained, redundant personnel should be thoroughly cut, and the transformation of the material life and spiritual life of civil servants should be started at the same time. He also said that Fengxian County is currently doing this in this direction.</p>
<p>Local Communists Also Appear and Often Have Contact</p>
<p>Local communists still enter and exit Xuanqiao Township in Nanhui County from time to time, and their numbers are Zhang Fan, Wang Kegang, Zhu Boying, and other units. The local team often has contact with them. "Pudong Avenue" in the "Pudong South" refers to the highway from Nanqiao through Nantou in Nanhui to Bailonggang in Chuansha. The current roadbed and pavement have been completed, and the bridges will begin to be built today, and will be completed within fifteen days. This is the only constructive project in Pudong South in recent years.</p>
<h3>First Phase of Rice Ration for This Month is 5 Jin and 670 Yuan; Certificate Can Also Freely Choose to Purchase Same Amount of Flour</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The authorities have decided on the price of the first phase of household registration rice for this month, which is 5 shi jin of whole rice per person, sold at 670 Gold Yuan, and the key ration is sold at 510 Gold Yuan. The Civil Affairs Office distributes some American flour to meet the needs of some citizens to eat flour. It is still sold by the rice shops designated last month. Citizens can freely choose to purchase it. The first link of the household registration certificate purchases 5 shi jin of flour for 1,000 yuan, and the key certificate purchases 5 shi for 800 yuan. The first phase of household registration rice in March will begin to be sold from today (6th) and will end on March 13.</p>
<h3>Garrison Department Cracks Down on Stealing and Selling Gasoline Case</h3>

It is learned that the amount of gasoline involved is as high as 500 barrels, all owned by the United Relief Headquarters. A number of unruly soldiers colluded to steal and transport it from Taiwan to Shanghai, and sold it to manufacturers through Mobil brokers. Xu Bingxun, a Mobil broker, was once detained and interrogated by the police station the day before yesterday afternoon, and was released until late at night. The main culprit, Lin, has escaped. The garrison authorities are still continuing to investigate the details of the case, which may be released in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Relatives of the Victims of the Jiangya Ship Disaster Directly Sue; Sentencing Not Accepted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhu Xiangtai from Yin County, because his daughter Zhu Jianying and her daughters Han Han and Han Jue died when the Jiangya ship sank on December 3 last year, filed a private prosecution with the District Court of this city against Xu Xueyu, the general manager of China Merchants Bureau to which the Jiangya ship belonged, and Shen Dacai, the captain of the ship, for causing death due to negligence, and filed an accompanying civil lawsuit, requesting compensation. The District Court Judge Wang Kanghou sentenced yesterday that the private prosecution was not accepted, and the plaintiff's lawsuit in the accompanying civil lawsuit was dismissed. The reasons for the judgment stated that the prosecution procedure in this case violated the regulations, and a judgment of non-acceptance could be announced without verbal arguments.</p>
<h3>"Corpse in a Suitcase Apparition"? Strange Tales at the North Train Station; Station Worker Sees Someone Pacing in the Next Room, Waking the Next Morning with Creeping Dread</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The train suitcase corpse case has been jointly investigated by the Municipal Police Department and the Railway Police since yesterday. According to them, although new leads have been discovered, the case is still far from being solved. On the contrary, the case seems to be more complex and confusing, and has entered a frustrating stage of investigation. The precision of the actions and the thoroughness of the planning by the perpetrator in this case are rarely seen in past homicides. For example, the victim's family has not come forward, no fingerprints were left on the corpse pieces or the suitcase, and the person transporting the suitcase calmly escaped after bringing the corpse to the North Station, leaving no trace that can be used for investigation. All of this proves that the perpetrator(s) of this case are extremely cunning individuals with considerable criminal experience. Therefore, items such as the woman's overcoat and underwear found in the suitcase are likely to be a</p>
<p>smoke screen</p>
<p>deliberately set by the perpetrator to divert the attention of the detectives and mislead the investigation. Currently, the Municipal Police Department and the Railway Police are working hard, and they are not letting go of any clues that could aid the investigation. Chief Jin Zhiwen of the Railway Police Department, who is in charge of the case, has personally gone to Hangzhou to investigate, as it is unclear whether the "suitcase corpse" was transferred from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway or any station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, making Hangzhou a crucial investigation point.</p>
<p>North Train Station</p>
<p>Yesterday, strange tales of the "suitcase corpse" apparition seeking redress spread again. Although these events have no scientific basis, they are recorded for scholars of the soul to study. After the District Procuratorate examined the corpse a few days ago, all the large and small suitcases containing the corpse pieces, as well as the woman's overcoat, underwear, yellow military blanket, cotton batting, newspapers, and other items found in the suitcase, were taken back to the Railway Police for further investigation. These items were locked in the lost and found storage room of the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Police Section at the North Station. This room is located on the left side of the North Station's main hall, behind the main building, and is next to the temporary dormitory for construction workers. The two rooms are separated by wooden boards. The night before, only a station worker named Xu was staying in the dormitory. He did not know that such items were stored in the next room. In the middle of the night, Xu heard groaning sounds in his sleep, intermittent and weak. Xu sat up and listened carefully. He then heard the sound of teeth grinding, coming from the next room. Xu got out of bed and peered through a gap in the wooden wall. He saw that the light in the room was bright (the light in that room was left on all night), and someone was pacing back and forth in the room. Because the gap was very low, he could not</p>
<p>see the face.</p>
<p>Xu thought it was a criminal apprehended by the police and held in that room, so he went back to sleep. Around five o'clock in the morning, Xu got up to prepare for his shift. Remembering what had happened the night before, he went to check the next room again. He saw that the door was tightly locked and could not be opened. Looking inside through the small iron window in the upper half of the door, he saw only suitcases, cotton batting, and other items, but no one was there. Xu stood there dumbfounded for a long time, then quickly left. Recalling what he had heard and seen the night before, he felt a creeping dread and could not focus on his work. After being questioned by his colleagues, he finally revealed what had happened, and everyone was surprised. After the reporter received the news and went to interview him, Xu initially refused to admit it. After repeated inquiries, he finally said that it was true and described the events in detail to the reporter, seeming to still have lingering fear. The police authorities have since moved the suitcases and other items to another location to avoid further incidents of ghostly suspicion.</p>
<h3>National University and College Staff Association Cables Requests for Professional Development Funds</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Shanghai's national universities and colleges presidents, faculty associations, and faculty fellowships appeal and request the allocation of professional development funds. The cable reads: "It has been observed that representatives of the faculty fellowships of national universities and colleges in this city, as well as presidents of various institutions, have successively gone to the capital to petition and appeal for increased compensation for all employees, and have achieved considerable results. Colleagues are deeply grateful. However, upon careful examination of the results of improved compensation, it is reasonably fair to teachers, students, and school workers, but the benefits for staff have not been given equal consideration, which seems inappropriate from a rational perspective. Generally, staff salaries are relatively low, and they do not receive research funds or hourly fees, nor can they hold outside jobs, making it difficult to maintain personal livelihood with their monthly income, let alone support a family. Moreover, staff members are also school employees, and research and professional development are equally necessary. Therefore, the Ministry of Education has long issued orders regarding staff professional development, but there are no funds available for the necessary expenses. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's allocation of professional development funds to municipal primary and secondary schools, all faculty and staff are equally distributed and benefit from the tangible advantages, with precedents available for reference. Moreover, staff members work diligently throughout the year, cannot hold outside jobs, and do not have winter or summer vacations, relying solely on this meager salary to support their families. In addition to separate cables, we specifically cable your Excellency and your esteemed association to consider the hardships of our colleagues and approve the allocation of professional development funds to all full-time staff members, based on the amount of research funds received by lecturers and teaching assistants, to facilitate professional development and maintain livelihood. We urgently await your instructions."</p>
<h3>Two Major Fires in the Nanshi District; One Person Buried in the Flames on Fuyou Road; Over a Hundred Shanties Destroyed in Xieqiao</h3>
<p>Suspicion of Arson by Clothing Store Owner; Newlyweds Flee Before Entering the Bridal Chamber</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Datongsheng Clothing Store at Nos. 84 to 86 Anren Street, Fuyou Road, in the Nanshi District, caught fire at approximately 1:20 AM yesterday. In an instant, fierce flames erupted, and tongues of fire shot out, quickly engulfing the adjacent Futai Cigarette and Paper Store at No. 80, the Meimei Barber Shop at No. 85 across the street, and several other shops and buildings, including the Yida Southern Goods Store. Upon receiving the report, fire brigades from various districts in the Nanshi District rushed to the scene with pump trucks to extinguish the fire, but the fire was too intense to control. At the same time, the Central Fire Department's observation tower also detected the fire and dispatched additional pump trucks to assist. It took an hour to extinguish the fire. However, the Datongsheng Clothing Store, Futai Cigarette and Paper Store, and Meimei Barber Shop, where the fire started, were completely destroyed. In addition, three shops and buildings at Nos. 83, 81, and 89 also suffered slight damage to their facades. During the fire, Xu Jinchou, the owner of the Futai Cigarette and Paper Store, was unable to escape and perished in the flames. As of 6:00 or 7:00 AM, the Yimiao Police Department was dispatching officers to work with firefighters from the Northern District Fire Brigade to excavate the burned body. Rumor has it that Ding Zizhang, the owner of the Datongsheng Clothing Store, is suspected of arson and has been detained for questioning by the local police station. [Report from our newspaper] Shanties in the Huixiang Lane area of Liyuan Road, Xieqiao, mainly inhabited by coolies, caught fire at approximately 2:05 PM yesterday. The fire started at the home of Yue Yacheng at No. 17, due to carelessness while cooking, and spread to the thatched roof above. It quickly spread, and fueled by the southerly wind, the fire spread even faster, turning the surrounding shanties into ashes in an instant. The fire also affected four tile-roofed houses at Nos. 1, 3, and 4 Fuan Lane, and 20 shops on Liyuan Road from No. 137 to No. 257. The most amusing incident was that of one household where the bride and groom were performing the wedding ceremony when the fire alarm suddenly sounded. The newlyweds immediately stopped the ceremony and rushed to save their dowry trunks and belongings. The guests also helped with the evacuation. The people had just escaped from the house when the new house was visited by the god of fire and was completely destroyed in an instant. Fire brigades from various districts in the Nanshi District and the Fire Department rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which was finally extinguished at 5:30 PM. It is estimated that over a hundred shanties and over twenty houses were destroyed.</p>

<h3>Readers Express Opposition to Public Utility Tariffs Based on Customs Gold Units</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to the report on March 2nd, the method of adjusting water and electricity fees and public transportation fares daily according to the Customs Gold Unit (CGU) may prevent losses for the companies, but it is unsatisfactory for the public. The main reason is that there is a gap of about ten days between the meter reading date and the arrival of the bill. During this period of rapidly rising prices, the CGU price is bound to increase daily, and the burden of this loss on the citizens is unbearable. Although there is a prepayment method, citizens will effectively be forced to pay an extra month's worth of water and electricity fees when they make their first prepayment. In this time of difficult living, it is even more difficult to cope. (2) The general situation in Shanghai is that, apart from the wealthy, most houses have three to five households, or even ten or more, sharing one water (or electricity) meter, and one person is entrusted to collect the money and pay the company. It is impossible for the entrusted person to collect the full amount in one day. As the CGU price changes from time to time, who will bear the difference?</p>
<p>In summary, the trouble of calculation and the waste of time in collecting the money are secondary. Therefore, it is necessary for the authorities to reconsider. I respectfully wish you good health. Reader Niu Weiqiao</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Xu Jiafan, 35 years old, from Yuyao, a professional engineer, resides at No. 48, Lane 383, Xiangyang Road. His girlfriend, Wang Lunming, 26 years old, from Jiading, studies at Southeast Medical College at No. 565 Zhizaoju Road. At approximately 7:00 PM yesterday evening, Xu was escorting Miss Wang to school. While walking arm in arm past the entrance of No. 76 Runan Street, Zhizaoju Road, they were suddenly confronted by two robbers. One was wearing a yellow uniform, and the other was in plain clothes. They blocked their way, and the one in the yellow uniform pulled out a pistol, forbidding them from making a sound. They robbed each of them of a gold ring, a watch, and a bag of cosmetics, and fled with the stolen goods. Xu shouted for help, which enraged the robbers, who turned around and fired a shot, fortunately missing. Afterwards, the Songshan Road Police Department, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to search for the robbers, but they had already disappeared without a trace.

<h3>The Family of Fu Zuoyi: General Ma Jiyuan Once Visited</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Airmail dispatch from Lanzhou on the 2nd] The Kunlun News (a temporary weekly publication) here published a short dispatch from Pingliang stating that the mother of Mr. Fu Yisheng (Zuoyi) is now residing in Pingliang. General Ma Jiyuan, the commander of the 82nd Army stationed there, visited her and conveyed greetings on behalf of his father, Chairman Ma Bufang. Below is the visit report personally written by this young general, who is only twenty-nine years old. General Ma Jiyuan has an extreme love for new literature. Even during the fierce battles in eastern Gansu last year, when military affairs were pressing, he never put down Western masterpieces. His study often displays portraits and quotations of great writers, which was commonly seen by Chinese and foreign reporters when they visited eastern Gansu last year. In this visit report, full of human sentiment, we can not only appreciate his fluent writing style and feel his abundant enthusiasm, but also reflect the view of a northwestern young general towards Mr. Fu Yisheng.</p>
<p>Like the Home of an Elementary School Teacher</p>
<p>Only the day before, I heard that the family of Mr. Fu Yisheng (Zuoyi) had departed from Xi'an for Pingliang, intending to go to Lanzhou. Later, I heard that Mr. Fu's mother had been living in Pingliang for nearly ten years! I was surprised, why didn't I know anything about it.</p>
<p>I first asked Deputy Director Li (reporter's note: Mr. Li is the Deputy Director of the 82nd Political Work Department) to visit once to inquire, and then I would go to visit. Mr. Li returned and said that it was true, that Mr. Fu's uncle and his family of more than ten people had gone to Lanzhou, and that the mother and family members who had been living here for a long time remained. He also said: "I didn't expect Mr. Fu's home to be so ordinary, as ordinary as the home of an elementary school teacher." When I heard this, I felt even more surprised!</p>
<p>The Mother Standing at the Door</p>
<p>Today, I specially prepared two baskets of fruits and went to visit the mother with Mr. Li. The home is located on West Street in Pingliang City, I forgot the street number. On the way, I felt that I was not going to visit the mother of a high-ranking official, but rather to visit my own aunt.</p>
<p>The mother stood at the door to greet us, very much like the nanny who held me when I was a child, as simple as a commoner. In a bedroom and living room, the mother sat on the kang (a heated brick bed), and told me to sit on the wooden stool next to the kang. There was no formality or courtesy, and a kind of intimate love filled this small and dark room.</p>
<p>Hanging on the wall was a large photograph of Mr. Fu from ten years ago, in military uniform, said to have been taken in Suiyuan during the anti-Japanese war. I can't tell fortunes, but I felt a sense of loyalty and filial piety. The admiration arose spontaneously. From our sincere and cordial conversation, I learned that Mr. Fu's wife used to spin and weave at home in Suiyuan, and now she is in Chongqing, and her children are continuing their studies. Mr. Fu's son wanted to buy a beloved bicycle, but because he had no cash, it was bought by someone else!</p>
<p>The Hall North Like a Doorman</p>
<p>Mr. Fu often said at home: "We should be the same as ordinary people." If you don't listen to him, he will yell.</p>
<p>When I conveyed the words of Vice Commander (reporter's note: refers to Ma Bufang, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Military and Political Administration and Chairman of Qinghai Province) greeting the mother, and that Vice Commander welcomed them to live in Qinghai, the old lady seemed very pleased. She repeatedly offered us a plate of fruits and a plate of peanuts.</p>
<p>After saying goodbye, I met Mr. Fu's cousin at the gate. Before the introduction, I thought he was a doorman!</p>
<p>A Deep Contrast</p>
<p>On the way back, I was deeply moved by this visit. Mr. Fu is such a hero, why did he fail? Is this the justice of heaven and earth? Many family members of important people enjoy a life of luxury on weekdays, and fly away at the first sign of trouble, even taking their foreign dogs and foreign cats with them. But Mr. Fu's family went to the northwest, moving to the rear, and Mr. Fu even said to them: "It would be best if you all went to Xining, to Chairman Ma's place." What a profound contrast!</p>
<p>China does not need wealthy families, nor does it need bureaucrats. The vast, poor people of China urgently need people like Mr. Fu to be their public servants. Why don't those who claim to be public servants of the people emulate Mr. Fu's spirit? Can I learn Mr. Fu's noble and upright spirit? I pondered, I trembled, and at the same time, I thought more about my subordinates and my colleagues, would they emulate the style of a great man like Mr. Fu? I pondered more, I trembled more.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Turmoil in Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Airmail dispatch from Chengdu on the 2nd] In February, Chengdu, the Jinjiang River is warm, it is indeed a great scenery. The peaceful society of the Jin City was suddenly wrinkled by foreign rumors: it is said that in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, it is rumored that "the situation in the suburbs of Rong is tense, and war is about to break out," but the people living here have indeed never smelled a hint of war. The spread of the rumor is bizarre. Exploring the thread, it should be that the provincial political authorities have strengthened their defenses and preparations for emergencies, and frequent military transfers have caused unexpected misunderstandings. The truth needs to be reported.</p>
<p>Rumors Spread Ripples in Sichuan Politics</p>
<p>In recent months, there have been many military transports in the suburbs of Rong. The reason is that some of the conscripts in Sichuan Province for the past two years are being transported, and some are engaged in training. Transfers from various places are inevitable. At the same time, the Sichuan Military District, on the order of the Ministry of National Defense, transferred some security regiment recruits to Shaanxi to replenish Hu Zongnan's troops. Hu's troops, in preparation for emergencies, evacuated their families to Sichuan. On the Sichuan-Shaanxi road, transports were endless, and the population of counties along the route increased frequently. The general public rumored that the Shaanxi army was moving south in a steady stream, attempting to retreat into Sichuan. Just when Liu Wenhui's 24th Army in Xikang, two regiments originally stationed in Xinjin and Shuangliu, were ordered to move to Wuhou Temple in Chengdu, Wang Lingji was going to Chongqing to visit Zhang Qun to report on his work. Leaflets jointly opposing Wang in the name of Zou Lan and six other regimental commanders of the Sichuan Security Regiment were found in Rong, which immediately aroused social speculation, believing that there was a gap between Wang and Liu, and that the Kang army entered Sichuan with the intention of overthrowing Wang. It also happened that the students of the 23rd class of the Army Military Academy graduated and held field exercises in the suburbs of Rong. The rumbling of vehicles and the neighing of horses added to the tense atmosphere. With the confluence of these two accidental events, rumors of turmoil in Sichuan spread in the southeast, and then spread into Sichuan, making the citizens of Chengdu, who were in the midst of it, feel confused.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun Returns to Rong Situation Clarifies</p>
<p>The spread of rumors will inevitably have a negative impact on the overall situation of unity and preparedness. Therefore, Zhang Yuejun specially returned to Rong with Wang Lingji ahead of schedule to visit Sichuan and Xikang generals and discuss the grand plan of unity. Zhang flew to Chengdu on the 14th of last month and stayed in Rong for three days, visiting social elders and holding several cordial talks with Liu Wenhui, Wang Xuxu, Wang Lingji, and others. He also attended the Provincial Senate and the joint welcome meeting of the National Assembly delegates, repeatedly emphasizing that Sichuan and Xikang are one family and must unite sincerely to respond to the changing situation. After this frank meeting, the rumors of chaos in Sichuan were thoroughly clarified. When Zhang returned with Wang, Liu Wenhui and Chuan Yi went to Chongqing to participate in Zhang's inauguration ceremony. The stars of Sichuan and Kang gathered in the capital, happily reminiscing and unifying their emotions, and the facts overturned the fantastic myths from outside. After taking office, Zhang convened an important meeting of the five southwestern provinces and cities to formulate a comprehensive reform plan for the current political, economic, and defense issues in the southwest, and took this plan to Nanjing. Wang Liu Deng (Xihou) then returned to Rong together to perform their respective tasks, in an atmosphere of peace, symbolizing Sichuan-Kang cooperation and building a bright future for the southwest.</p>
<p>Sichuan-Shaanxi Joint Defense Not Yet Concrete</p>
<p>Regarding the Shaanxi army entering Sichuan, the joint defense between Sichuan and Shaanxi had been brewing for a long time. The two provinces are interdependent and have always had close relations. In the recent evolution of the situation, Shu and Long are like Sichuan and Kang, brothers and one family, and there is no reason to separate them. The last time Wang Lingji and Hu Zongnan attended the military and political meeting in Beijing together, they had preliminary discussions on the specific plan for joint defense, that is, in the event of a sudden change in the situation, the Hu army would cooperate in defending Sichuan, and they exchanged opinions with each other. In the past month, the family members of the Hu army have been moving south in a steady stream, and the cities and counties along the Sichuan-Shaanxi line are full of evacuees, which is generally considered to be the prelude to the Hu army's entry into Sichuan. As a result, it caused considerable waves in Sichuan society. Most Sichuan people believe that Sichuan Province is currently organizing and training new troops and launching self-defense training, and its strength is sufficient to defend itself, so there is no need for neighboring provinces to provide assistance. At the tea party hosted by the Provincial Senate to welcome Zhang Qun, most of the provincial senators advocated that in the current situation, war and peace have not yet been decided, and there is no need for the Hu army to enter Sichuan. They should ask the authorities to politely decline the offer. At the same time, Hu Zongnan also sent a special letter to Chuan Yi, Speaker of the Sichuan Provincial Senate, inviting him to Xi'an to discuss the issue of joint defense. As of today, in addition to border defense cooperation and the designation of counties for defense in the joint defense zone, and unified military command, the entire plan for joint defense between the two provinces still needs to be thoroughly discussed, and there are no signs of the Hu army entering Sichuan. The claim that the Hu army is advancing into Chengdu is even closer to a myth. In short, the situation in Sichuan in the spring is indeed brewing for change, but the goal of brewing is to seek a more determined and more united response to change. Because if the overall situation is like this, attempting to split and divide will eventually lead to defeat. Under the power of the people, no bold warlord dares to risk the great disapproval of the world.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin, 3rd] A company of the first battalion of the county security regiment stationed in Anjiasha District, Xixiashu Town, has repeatedly clashed with the town over local supply issues. On the 3rd, as the head of the county security regiment, Zhu Fangyu, was personally gathering local people at the town's public office to talk, soldiers from the company unexpectedly surrounded the area and then rushed into the town's public office, using hand grenades to seriously injure two guards, Kong Songlin and Yuan Yinsheng, and confiscating their weapons. People were panic-stricken and all the shops in the town closed. The town's public office was vandalized, and the town head, Dan Xunyan, also disappeared. Zhu Fangyu, the head of the regiment who was on the scene, was unable to stop them. The situation was only brought under control after the 51st Army stationed near Menghe sent troops to suppress the riot.

<p>One Suspect and One Body Found</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Songjiang, 4th] Zhangze Town, which belongs to the county, has many harbors and bays, making it a place where bandits often appear. At 8 p.m. on the 2nd, more than a dozen bandits with local accents infiltrated the town, intending to attack and seize weapons from the self-defense force. The head of the team, Sun Quanzhang, discovered them and tried to arrest them. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest. After the self-defense force returned fire, the bandits retreated and fled by swimming away. That night, Ye Shuren and Gu Yougen, two people suspected of being involved, were arrested. They claimed to be former soldiers of the 207th Division of the Youth Army and denied robbery. At dawn the next day, the body of a bandit with gunshot wounds was found in the Daqiao River. He was apparently trying to escape by swimming away. A county identity card from Bogen of the 12th household of the 6th Jia of the 6th Bao of Tinglin Town was found in his pocket. In addition to reporting the matter to the local prosecutor's office for inspection, the arrested Gu Yougen was escorted to the county government for interrogation.

<h3>Price Increases Accelerating, Cash Funds Insufficient for Turnover, Banker's Drafts and Checks Flying Everywhere, Citizens Deeply Inconvenienced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After continuous soaring prices, the cash tightness in the market has increased unabated. Although the Central Bank has issued large notes of 500 and 1,000 yuan, the number of issuers is still small. However, because trading prices have been rising daily in the general market, people have resorted to checks and bank drafts because of insufficient cash for turnover. Recently, we see the phenomenon of drafts and checks flying everywhere. In the past few days, the number of exchanges by the check clearing house has been approaching 400,000 per day, an increase of one-fold from the previous few days. The total amount of exchanges has been averaging 80-90 billion yuan per day, an increase of about 50% from the previous three or four days. However, the number of bounced checks has not increased significantly because the trend of monetary conditions is relatively stable.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Due to the lack of issuance of 1,000-yuan banknotes, there has been an extreme shortage of cash chips on the market for consecutive days. The general lines of business are very strict in limiting the payment of cash. Some lines of business even issue bank drafts for checks of about 10,000 yuan, causing the phenomenon of bank drafts flying everywhere to occur again. Citizens all feel deeply inconvenienced. According to officials in charge of the issuing bureau of the National Bank, the authorities are extremely concerned about the phenomenon of cash panic in the market. 500-yuan banknotes have been issued in moderate amounts for circulation in recent days. As for the 1,000-yuan banknotes, they will be paid in stages as needed based on the facts in the future. However, as of yesterday, they have not yet been issued.</p>
<h3>Head Office Supply is Abundant, Money Tightens and then Relaxes</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the monetary conditions in the city were stable before relaxing. At the start of the morning, the interbank overnight interest rate was around 70 yuan. Because it was the weekend, those with short positions sought outwards before 10 o'clock or so, and those with long positions held a wait-and-see attitude, so the trend was still relatively stable. However, by 11 o'clock or so, the head office supply was abundant, and those with long positions sought to lend out, and the secret interest rate decreased. Usually, it was around 60 yuan, and at one point, the low price of 55 yuan was seen. Near noon, as the wind of rising prices began to blow, those seeking short positions became active again, and the bid price rose back to between 60 and 65 yuan. The average market interest rate for each industry was around 60 yuan. Only rice and flour were lower, between 50 and 55 yuan. Man-made silk was made at 55 yuan to 60 yuan, and the stock exchange charged interest at 53 to 58 yuan. The interest rate of the National Bank did not move.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Treasury Bureau Handles Gold Price Payment Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] I just learned from the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank: A total of five draws were made for the first principal repayment lottery of the 1949 Gold Public Bond Phase I bonds. The winning numbers are 10, 42, 51, 78, 96. In accordance with the bond sale and redemption procedures, procedures have been started on March 3rd. All the above-mentioned winning number bonds and expired coupons will be temporarily handled by the Bureau in Shanghai for redemption.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Silver Dollar Deposits by Companies and Banks Encountered Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>Regarding the preparations for silver dollar deposits in the financial industry in this city, the Financial Administration believes that the prospects are bleak after the implementation. According to the person in charge of the bureau, there are two reasons for this: (1) The management of silver dollar loans by lines of business was not a problem in peacetime when the economy was stable. However, in today's situation with too much price fluctuation, there are too many risks, and it is feared that it will be difficult to recover after the loan is released, and it may affect the business prospects of the lines of business. (2) After the silver dollar deposit is held, it is estimated that the deposit interest rate will only be around 2%. In today's situation of high market interest rates, this low interest rate is unwelcome by depositors. It is also impossible to make short-term overnight loans. Under these circumstances, there are many difficulties in whether to implement silver dollar loans. Also, the method of accounting for silver dollar deposits is that the Financial Management Bureau believes that it can be recorded as a "physical account," and silver dollars must never be used as the unit of account, and gold yuan must still be used as the unit of account.</p>
<h3>Banking Bureau Continues to Clear Out</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The National Banking Bureau continued to clear out 16,022 ten thousand yuan yesterday. Various banks cleared in 82,219,700 yuan for the large exchange. Foreign merchant banks cleared in 14,421 ten thousand yuan. Various banks cleared out 80,717 ten thousand yuan for the small exchange.</p>
<h3>Money Loosens, Big Players Raise Prices, Chinese Stocks Nearly Full House</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks launched an extremely fierce wave of rising prices. Near noon, nearly all stocks were rising, only a limited number of stocks such as Dongxing Shirts and Socks and Taiwan Sugar did not reach the limit. Yesterday, the money market was quite loose, with overnight interest rates at most at 6 Jiao, and about 5 Jiao was lent out near noon. Big players in the market strongly raised the prices of Yongsheng and Meiya to the limit. The number of small stocks reaching the limit exceeded all previous records. Yongsheng opened high at 4 yuan 5 Jiao 3 Fen. After opening, it continued to hover at a high level, and it was close to the limit twice. No. 156 fully resisted shorts. The low price was 4 yuan 4 Jiao 8 Fen. Around 11 o'clock, Securities No. 107 continued to raise prices, and retail investors followed suit. At 11:50, it reached the limit of 4 yuan 9 Jiao. The trend of Meiya also appeared to be rising all the way. It initially opened at 1 yuan 8 Jiao. It once fell to 1 yuan 7 Jiao 7 Fen as the gold price outside the market fell slightly. Retail investors bought when the price was low. At noon, as the gold price outside the market rose, the securities company continued to raise prices and went straight to the limit of 1 yuan 9 Jiao 3 Fen. Taiwan Sugar once reached the limit twice, but due to the limited interest rate for one day on Sunday, people sold them one after another, and the closing price fell to 30,000 yuan. The small stocks that reached the limit included China Cement at 4 Jiao 3 Fen, Zhenhua Paint at 2 yuan 5 Jiao 1 Fen, Zhabei Water and Electricity at 1 yuan 2 Jiao, Huafeng Enamel at 2 yuan 06 Fen, China-France Pharmacy at 8 Jiao 2 Fen, New Asia Pharmaceutical at 1 yuan 7 Jiao 4 Fen, Hengfeng at 1 yuan 2 Jiao 6 Fen, Xinhe at 1 yuan 6 Jiao 3 Fen, Jinglun at 1 yuan 6 Jiao 2 Fen, Xinhua Department Store at 1 yuan 2 Jiao 4 Fen, Xinguang at 4 Jiao 6 Fen, and 15 types including Commercial Press, Great China Match, and Wing On Company. The total turnover for half a day was 3,800,000,975 shares, including 152,700,000 shares of Yongsheng.</p>
<p>The market situation of the gold public bonds was that the initial price was 161,500 yuan, then it went to 165,000 yuan and rose to 170,000 yuan, and stayed there for a long time. It fell again to 165,000 yuan, and the final closing price was 168,000 yuan, with a fluctuation range of 8,500 yuan. It rose 8,600 yuan compared to the previous day. The total turnover was 236 taels.</p>
<p>Taiwan Sugar Dividable Receipt</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Stock Exchange has set the trading unit for Taiwan Sugar Corporation shares at 10 shares. The face value of the company's shares circulating in the market is mostly more than 10 shares, and the delivery is very difficult. The Stock Exchange has obtained the company's consent to temporarily issue dividable receipts for shares with a face value of more than 10 shares at the time of delivery. After the original shares are exchanged for small-value shares from the company, a notice will be issued to exchange the shares based on the receipt. The fee for the company to exchange the shares and the transfer fee, which are handled by the Stock Exchange, are temporarily set at 600 yuan per share. If the company adjusts the fee amount in the future, the fee will also be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Wing On Textile Mill to Launch Dividend</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The board of directors of Wing On Textile Company recently resolved to launch the 1948 dividend on the 14th of this month, calculated as 1 Fen weekly interest, which is converted into gold yuan at the legal currency according to the amount of capital stock. In addition, cotton yarn gifts will be distributed, and the value of the cotton yarn gifts that should be obtained will be estimated according to the market price of cotton yarn on the 14th and calculated for distribution. However, no matter when the shareholders receive the gifts in the future, the estimated price will be taken as the standard, and it will not change due to the rise or fall of the yarn price.</p>
<p>Also, the Stock Exchange made a special announcement in the market yesterday that the company's shares will be traded without interest and without rights from the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>Serious Fuel Problem</h3>
<p>The entire fuel problem in this city is facing a serious stage. Not only is the reserve becoming scarce, but the source has not yet improved. The market price has not shown any signs of declining. The price of coal balls has also been increased for the fifth time since the beginning of the year due to the high cost of raw materials and insufficient cost, soaring from 4,200 yuan per load to 7,000 yuan. According to relevant sources, the responsible authorities have repeatedly made efforts to purchase, or even discussed reducing the use of fuel, but the situation in various coal-producing areas is complicated, or damaged by war, and it is impossible to ship goods for a while. In addition, transportation is difficult, so the sources from all roads have not been restored as expected.</p>
<h3>National Bank Purchases US Dollars, Improves Redemption Methods</h3>
<p>Although the Central Bank raises the listed price every day for purchasing US dollars, the number of people who exchange is very small because the listed price is still far from the market price. Now, in order to take care of the actual situation, the bank has temporarily stopped listing prices and changed the purchase method. It has entrusted the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to purchase US dollars based on the foreign exchange transfer certificate price of the previous day. The purchase price yesterday was 3,700 yuan per US dollar.</p>
<h3>National Bank Adjusts Personnel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank has adjusted the heads of branches in various places. Pan Yimin, the manager of the Xi'an branch, has been transferred to the manager of the Hangzhou branch.

<h3>Tea Market Apparently Flat but Secretly Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market continued to show a solid trend in the calm. Because it was the weekend, and after the arrival of various colors from Wutun and other places ceased, and although goods from Zhejiang and other places are arriving in Shanghai, the inventory of old tea is empty, and the new season is still quite a distance away. Holders are single-mindedly holding on to sales and do not allow easy disposal. Therefore, it is difficult for buyers to be satisfied, and the transaction is therefore strangely sluggish, and the process is said to be gradually increasing. In terms of prices, due to the relationship between the goods, there has not been significant progress, and all say that they are apparently flat but secretly rising.</p>
<h3>Silk Soars</h3>
<p>The man-made silk market yesterday rose with interest. The city's money market loosened, and the secret interest rate within the industry was 60 yuan to 65 yuan. When the market opened in the morning, the gold trend outside the market was still flat, and it weakened after opening, so people's hearts were still calm.</p>
<p>The opening price of No. 120 Tianqiao Monday's head office was 1,060,000 to 1,070,000. The trend was stable after opening, hovering around 1,100,000. After hearing that the gold market price had risen and the yarn outside the industry had risen around 11:00, people's hearts turned strong, and the market trend rose in a straight line, rising to 1,220,000 at noon. In the afternoon, because there was no market inside the company on Saturday, the gold price outside the market rose sharply, and the market trend was still strong, and the asking price was crazy, but there were no formal transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the raw silk market was not glorious in the foreign exchange market, and people's hearts were still calm when it first opened. The first offer of the top-grade retail market was 1,350,000 yuan. The intermediate trend was still stable. Afterwards, the gold price outside the industry rose, and the cotton yarn rose sharply. This street's desire to purchase increased, people's hearts tended to be flattered, and the market situation was extremely strong, rising to 1,520,000 at noon. In the afternoon, because gold rose sharply again, the market trend followed suit, and the asking price was about 200,000 yuan again.</p>
<p>The trend of the silk satin market yesterday fluctuated. From the morning opening to the closing of the market, the range of rise and fall was still close, and the market trend was still flat. Meiya quilt was initially sold for 670,000 yuan. In the middle of the process, because the secret interest rate was still high, scattered households released their goods to release interest, and the supply on the market was still strong, and the market trend weakened slightly. Once it recovered a small 5,000 yuan, people's hearts suddenly became strong after hearing that many Chinese stocks had risen to the limit and gold was approaching 220,000, and the contribution on the market was strong, and the asking price was high, closing near noon at 685,000 yuan, continuing to rise by more than 20,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the sharp rise in gold prices in raw silk and man-made silk also affected people's hearts, and Meiya shouted to sell at 740,000 to 750,000.</p>
<h3>Food Grains Soar, Especially the First-Class Rice Creates a New Price of 24,600, Flour, Food Oil, and Other Market Prices Jump Consistently</h3>
<p>The rise in food grains is flying high, because yesterday was Saturday, and the payment was separated by two days with very high interest, so the cargo owners also raised the price, and the hearts of the people were tight, and there were many households entering the market. The price of white rice in the North Market was as high as 23,400 yuan, a sharp increase of 3,700 yuan, and the price of special high-quality rice was 24,600 yuan, a sharp increase of 20%. The rise in the South Market was slower, with white rice at 22,200 yuan, an increase of about 2,700 to 3,000 yuan. The total number of registered arrivals in the two markets was 6,408 stones. The market trend suddenly took off, because of the Monday payment relationship, the cargo owners held on strongly, and the price of rice also soared. The old car broke the 10,000 yuan mark at the opening of the market, and reached 10,600 yuan at the closing of the market. The initial price of the soldiers' ship was a sharp increase of more than 1,000 yuan. Large households in the central market strongly absorbed it, and once hit the 10,000 yuan mark, and the closing price was slightly lower, trading at 9,980 yuan. After the closing of the market, scattered households were active, and the market trend hit the 10,000 yuan mark again, making a high price of 10,000 yuan, and the asking price in the after-market was 10,300 yuan. The bran broker strongly absorbed it, and it rose sharply by 15%, with large packages reaching a peak of 7,800 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Launched rising prices, soybeans with oil cake rose sharply, and the factory interest was particularly strong. Han Kou car beans rose sharply by 4,000 yuan, reaching a high of 21,500 yuan, and winter beans and Mulberry Garden beans generally rose by 20%. The rise in raw peanuts was more moderate. Yangzhou raw peanuts reached a height of 10%, hitting 20,000 yuan yesterday. The sales of corn and red sorghum were limited, and the increase was not much.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The rising trend is like wildfire, initially because rice prices rose, people's hearts were strong, and cargo owners strongly held on to the price, and the price increased by 10,000 yuan. Later, the buying interest was even stronger, and the price rose again sharply. Soybean oil finally rose by 18,000 yuan, reaching a high of 94,000 yuan, vegetable oil was 90,000 yuan, and good barrel raw oil exceeded the 100,000 yuan mark, and finally even reached 110,000 yuan (Qingdao), a sharp increase of 20,000 yuan, and soybean cake also increased by 20%.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Asks for High Prices</h3>
<p>The tung oil market yesterday showed a trend that was full of momentum after the market opened because people's hearts were strong and the trend was full of momentum. In an instant, it was also heard that financial items and items outside the industry all reached a peak. Holders also followed suit and shouted high prices, causing the rising trend to be out of control. Until the market closed, they continued to rise by 2,000 to 5,000 yuan uniformly, and the bottom was very solid, and the future was optimistic.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Actively Promotes Trade with the Sterling Area</h3>
<p>Organizing a Review Committee to Be Responsible for All Approvals</p>
<p>To promote trade with countries in the Sterling Area, the government, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, is gradually implementing measures. The Central Trust Bureau (CTB) was instructed to convene meetings with relevant agencies, including the Ministries of Industry and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, Finance, the National Resources Commission, the Central Bank, and the Export-Import Control Board, to discuss trade issues with Sterling Area countries. Decisions were made regarding trade partners, goods, and trade volumes. The initial phase is tentatively set at 500,000 pounds, with pilot programs in countries such as the UK, Australia, India, Pakistan, New Zealand, the Malay Archipelago, the Dutch East Indies, and Burma. Exported goods will include cotton yarn, raw silk, tea, and hog bristles. Imported goods will include rice, wheat, cotton, wool, rubber, burlap sacks, machinery, and fertilizers. According to Deng Fei, the manager of the CTB's Barter Trade Department, the bureau is actively working on trade matters with Sterling Area countries. The Chinese side has already compiled a list of export and import goods, and the Ministries of Industry and Commerce and Foreign Affairs are exchanging opinions with Sterling Area countries. If an agreement is reached, contracts will be signed, and formal transactions will begin. The CTB is handling this matter on behalf of the government and is proceeding according to instructions from above. It is understood that this trade will still be conducted through barter. The CTB has drafted eleven measures and, based on factual needs, will establish a Sterling Area Barter Trade Review Committee. This committee will consist of the CTB Director-General, Deputy Director-General, relevant department heads, and representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Industry and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, the Export-Import Control Board, the National Resources Commission, the Central Bank, the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Shanghai Import-Export Association. The Director-General will serve as the convener. The Review Committee will be responsible for reviewing and approving all aspects of barter trade, including target countries, trade limits, and the types and prices of goods for import and export. Furthermore, to secure export trade goods, the CTB will, as needed, purchase them in advance from concentrated production areas or cooperate with reputable manufacturers in various regions for procurement and production. Imported goods will be sold on the market at any time under the overall plan of the Government Materials Allocation Committee. Any profits or losses incurred from barter trade will be remitted to the national treasury. The CTB will estimate the amount of funds needed for purchasing export goods and importing goods and will submit this amount to the Executive Yuan for approval. After approval, the CTB will open an account at the Central Bank specifically for the cost of purchasing export goods and importing goods from Sterling Area countries, which the CTB can then use as needed.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>According to the Export-Import Control Board, the export price limit for the coming week (March 7th to 13th) will remain the same as last week, with no changes.</p>
<p>The trade in furs and wool is being held back. Today, foreign firms like New Sheng are experiencing sluggish trading because overseas telegram replies have not yet arrived. However, those holding the goods are reluctant to sell at lower prices due to rising prices of other goods outside the industry.</p>
<h3>A Stroll Through the Market: Observing the Taiwanese Visitors</h3>
<p>An Afternoon Hurricane Sends the Whole City into a Frenzy: The Nanyang Region First Uses the Windfall Silver Dollars as a First Strike</p>
<p>Since the issuance of the large denomination banknotes, there has been a universal expectation of appreciation. Financial authorities are releasing foreign exchange transfer certificates and are willing to raise interest rates to tighten the money supply, which has created the current abnormal psychology in the market.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, prices have risen daily. However, while sellers feel that the selling price is low, they also feel that earning interest on the proceeds provides some compensation. Buyers, while feeling that it is not as good as earning interest, do not mind the purchase price and feel that it will be cheaper in the long run.</p>
<p>Both buyers and sellers are uneasy in this contradictory state of mind. As a result, the market atmosphere has reversed from the excitement of the previous days and has become sluggish.</p>
<p>Yesterday, besides the stock market, which was almost completely up, other markets remained stagnant. However, around 3:00 PM, a sudden surge occurred, with gold certificates and silver dollars leading the way with sharp rises. The market prices of general commodities also increased successively, but no one knew where the price increases came from.</p>
<p>There are indeed military rumors circulating in the market, but they seem unlikely to be true. After checking foreign news, it became clear that this price surge originated in Hong Kong and is related to the financial war situation between Britain and the United States that we have been discussing for days.</p>
<p>The United States opposes South Africa's price increase in gold sales and is taking various active measures. In its sphere of influence, it is implementing controls in places where gold imports and exports have not yet been restricted.</p>
<p>The Philippines was originally a free port for gold imports and exports. Many of the bills here come from Hong Kong, and many of the Hong Kong bills come from the Philippines. The Philippines gets its gold from Australia, South America and elsewhere. The Philippine government suddenly ordered the management of gold trade from the day before yesterday. Henceforth, the import and export of gold in the Philippines must be approved by the government.</p>
<p>This action was apparently orchestrated by the United States, with two possible intentions: (1) To prevent the outflow of gold reserves within the US sphere of influence due to rising gold prices in various parts of Europe, which would affect the US's position as the world's largest holder of gold. (2) The United States may be considering raising gold prices and must therefore control exports in advance to reduce losses. The news of the Philippine government's control of gold trade reached Hong Kong, and the price of gold in Hong Kong immediately surged from 304 yuan to more than 307 yuan yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Another reason is that the United States explicitly rejected China's request for a silver loan. This news was published in the early newspapers. The stock market is the most sensitive and knows that with the disappointment of the silver loan, the hope of a turnaround for the gold yuan and finance is even slimmer. Therefore, the prices of sixteen stocks were pushed to the limit, which then spread to the whole city. Of course, the Yuan Toutou (silver dollar) was the first to be affected, but the news of the silver dollar speculators is still slow, and their knowledge is still shallow. Therefore, the price surge was still led by gold certificates, but looking ahead to next week, if there are any special changes, the Yuan Toutou may still have a new performance, which is not yet known.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise Sharply; Cotton Cloth Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw an even greater rise in prices. With the money supply easing, people's minds are unsettled, and the atmosphere of speculation is strong. All parties flocked to purchase, and the prices of various yarns reached new highs.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened at 1.47 million yuan and eventually rose to 1.54 million yuan, a sharp increase of 300,000 yuan. 40-count Jin Cheng yarn jumped 230,000 yuan to close at 1.5 million yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn broke through the 1 million yuan mark to reach 1.14 million yuan, a sharp increase of 230,000 yuan.</p>
<p>11-count Double Horse spot yarn jumped directly from 710,000 yuan to stand firm at the 900,000 yuan mark, ending at 200,500 yuan higher. Factory orders appeared at 840,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse created a new peak of 130,000 yuan. Other yarns such as Jin Cheng and Tian Nu were opening between 100,000 yuan and 850,000 yuan. 16-count Guang Ming yarn approached 800,000 yuan and ended at 770,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cloth market was prosperous. In the morning, sales in the local streets were smooth, so the market opened high. Many people needed to sell their positions before closing, so the market saw a slight decline. In the afternoon, when news of sharp increases in black and red cloth came, people's hearts were greatly encouraged. Buying was very strong outside the market, and the market once again saw a sharp rise.</p>
<p>Nengtou fine cloth rose from 31,500 yuan to a high of 32,000 yuan. Due to many short sales before closing, the price dropped circuitously and closed at 31,000 yuan, a net increase of 2,200 yuan. In the afternoon, transactions were made at 37,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Si Junzi Yuan serge initially traded from 29,500 yuan and slowly fell to 28,400 yuan, eventually closing at 29,100 yuan, a net increase of 1,900 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial asking price was 31,500 yuan, reaching a high of 36,500 yuan, before gradually retreating to 35,000 yuan. 190 high-grade shilin (dye) hit the 70,000 yuan mark, and colored and printed fabrics also saw new highs.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Spring Sales Launched</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wholesale market for woolens and serge saw increased activity. Many businesses were asking the CTB and the China Textile Corporation for goods, and brokers were busy running around. This is because Western suit and fashion shops and woolen and foreign goods stores in various districts have all launched spring sales. Custom-made suits costing more than 100,000 yuan and pieces of material costing more than 50,000 yuan are being ordered and sold. At the same time, people's minds in Nanjing have become more at ease, sales have progressed, and many businesses have added goods and reopened. The prices of woolen goods are quite firm, and people in the industry are unanimously optimistic.</p>

<h3>Joe Louis' Autobiography (3)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Cang Long</p>
<p>After my first professional boxing match, I earned a net of fifty-two dollars. This was still an undercard fight. In six months of professional fighting, I won ten fights by knockout and two fights by points decision. Gradually, my weight also increased. By the time I fought Burkeham in 1935, my weight had increased to one hundred and ninety-four pounds. After my second defeat of Lame Li, my name and picture appeared in all the newspapers. They gave me the title "Brown Bomber." Many boxing promoters came to contact me, but the conditions were all vague. As a result, I signed a contract with Uncle Mike. This was the prelude to my beginning to make big money. In my fight against Lai Hanluo, I earned a net of twelve thousand dollars at once. At that time, it had only been ten months since I turned professional. And most boxers have to fight for years before they can barely earn ten thousand dollars in one fight. At this time, it was only one month away from my twenty-first birthday. During Easter of that year, I bought a total of one or two houses for my mother and sisters.</p>
<p>In 1935, I went to Yankee Stadium in New York to fight former heavyweight champion Canara. Many people hoped that I would lose. When I arrived at the stadium, the flashing lights of many cameras almost blinded my eyes. Reporters asked many questions, and I could only answer a very small part of them. Some people said that I looked very unhappy. This was not the case. Such a scene was too big and superfluous for a newcomer.</p>
<p>Many newspapers said that when I was rising to prominence and when I won the championship, I was surrounded by scalpers. And they constantly made unfounded accusations against my manager and coach. However, my manager and coach never taught me to give up any battle. I think they were indeed doing their job practically. At the same time, among the people around me, I did have people I could trust. For example, Gong Shi, who was in charge of ticketing, was a determined accountant. My legal advisor, Jebsen, was the civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army. These people all had high reputations, and they managed all my affairs.</p>
<p>When we were ready for the fight against Canara, many gangsters in New York wanted to open a "knife" to us. Some people may have accepted it, but we hired our own police and pushed these people out the door. The night of the fight against Canara on June 25 was truly the most clearly remembered night of all my battles. That night, I was all normal. Canara wanted to scare me off with his physique. In the fourth round, when we were wrestling together, he tried to use his weight to attack me, but I made a move before him and threw him open very clearly. At that time, I only saw his jaw drooping and a strange expression on his face, because no one had ever thrown him like this before. Before he could close his mouth, I punched him in the head again, and his eyes suddenly became bright. In the sixth round, I hit him in the jaw again, and he fell to the ground. Although he stood up slowly and staggeringly, he could not withstand a hook with his left hand and a punch with his right hand directly to the brain, and he fell again. This time, he could no longer climb up. As a result of that bloody battle, I earned a net of sixty thousand dollars!</p>
<p>After this, they found Baer to fight me again. At this time, Baer's heavyweight championship had only recently been taken away by Braddock. Hours before the opening of the fight against Baer, I married a stenographer from Chicago named Maff. Maff watched me defeat Baer that night. (Note: Joe Louis and Maff have now divorced for the second time).</p>
<p>However, bad luck came. In June 1936, in the first fight against Schmelling at Yankee Stadium in New York, he defeated me. He almost canceled all the achievements I had already made in the boxing world! At that time, I was not yet twenty-two years old. I think this was the worst night I had ever experienced. This is something I want to forget the most! Beforehand, I had expected to win this battle easily, but things did not go as planned. Schmelling's right-hand killer punch almost shattered my jaw, and I fell to the ground at once. His few hard punches from the right often hit my face, beating my face bloody, and later even my vision was blurred. This was the only time I had encountered this in all my battles, but he kept fighting me until the twelfth round before he finally solved me.</p>
<p>In August and September of the same year, I defeated Shaw and Aito one after another. However, reporters still thought that Schmelling had completely defeated me, but they were wrong. I have sufficient battlefield experience to estimate the intentions of each opponent, and I still have full confidence. At that time, my manager wanted to arrange a second fight with Schmelling, but Xu refused. Finally, Uncle Mike came up with the idea to agree to fight Braddock, who was the world heavyweight champion at that time. The date of that decisive battle was set for June 20, 1937.</p>
<p>Braddock was really a killer, hitting hard punches. The length of time he fought me exceeded my expectations. I had planned to solve him in the fifth round, but the sixth and seventh rounds continued until the eighth round, when his arms and legs completely lost control. I used all my strength to swing a solid punch, hitting his right face, and he immediately fell face down in response. This time I won the world heavyweight boxing championship!</p>
<p>When I was actively training to prepare for the second battle against Schmelling, I vaguely heard Schmelling say to others: Germans are a superior race, and he will prove this in boxing. On the night of the decisive battle with Schmelling, I was fully prepared. As soon as my left hand punched, my right hand followed closely and hit his jaw. He was exhausted to parry, and I used all my skills to punch him to the rope circle on the edge of the field. His knees bent down, and I grabbed him away from the rope circle with one hand and punched him in the belly again. He screamed, and I thought to myself: "How is it, self-proclaimed superior species!" Then I repeatedly hit various key points on his body and jaw. He fell for the first time and soon got up, but he could not withstand a hook with my left fist and a swing with my right fist, and he fell again. As soon as he climbed off the ground, a fatal blow from my fist hit his chin, and he could no longer climb up this time. However, Schmelling later said in Germany that the reason he was defeated was because I had committed a foul. This is another reason why I hate Schmelling. The filmed movies clearly proved that I did not commit a foul, but these movies were never shown in Germany.</p>

<h3>Wong Peng Soon to Fight Phil Fietman in the All-England Badminton Men's Singles Final; Wong Bing Soon Loses After a Valiant Fight in the Semi-Finals</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] London, 4th: Malayan champion Wong Peng Soon, having crushed American player Love Tate 15-6, 15-5, will face Phil Fietman, undefeated for ten years, in the final to determine the champion.</p>
<p>Wong Bing Soon, whose arm injury has not yet healed, was defeated by Phil Fietman in the semi-final. The score was 15-2, 15-4. However, the match was very exciting and intense, not as one-sided as the score suggests. Fietman is agile and accurate in his strokes. The six points he lost were all due to Wong Bing Soon's continuous shell-like high-pressure smashes in front of the net, which were impossible to save.</p>
<p>Wong Peng Soon's outstanding performance forced Love Tate to submit within 26 minutes. The air conditioning inside the venue was cold tonight. The Malayan player, who came from a temperate zone, was significantly affected at the beginning of the match, and was once behind 2-6 in the first game. But after that, he recovered to normal and scored ten points in a row with a barrage of powerful smashes. Love Tate was at a loss.</p>

<h3>Unexpected Outcome in Mayor's Cup Football Tournament: Two-Year Champion Lost Carelessly in Da Jingzhou. Suffering Soldiers, Suffering Generals, China Aviation Beat Qingbai, Yin Qingbing's Final Kick Makes the Whole Situation Look Completely Different.</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] In the Mayor's Cup football replay, a major upset occurred yesterday, and Qingbai, who had no problem winning the championship, was eliminated by China Aviation by two to one. China Aviation won the final spot. Qingbai had won the Mayor's Cup for two consecutive sessions, and the victory of this third session was interrupted. The silver cup changed hands, which was beyond the expectations of more than a thousand fans. In the first half, China Aviation took the lead with a score of one to zero. After Gao Xiuqing scored the first goal for China Aviation in the first ten minutes, Qingbai counterattacked, but to no avail. In the second half, Qingri was determined to fight to the death, and although the offensive was strong, it could not find the door. Nearly a thousand fans were already worried about Qingbai until the last ten minutes, when Jin Lusheng hit a goal and tied the score. At this time, the audience thought that the result would be a tie and overtime, but unexpectedly, in the last two minutes, Yin Qingbing of China Aviation charged, and Qingbai's goal was broken again. The two-year champion was tragically defeated.</p>
<p>Qingbai's defeat was due to underestimating the enemy in the first half. They thought they could win, and when the situation was dull, they were already unable to do anything and became more and more depressed. The team lost abnormally, and they were all listless and unusually relaxed. The defense was too poor, the defense line was wide open, the central defense line was like a decoration, and the forwards and defenders were cut into two sections. The forwards were not as good, and the shots and headers did not show any color. There were as many as fourteen or five corner kicks, but none of them bloomed. On the other hand, China Aviation fought hard as a team that was bound to lose, which is where the victory lies. Although there is luck and misfortune, it also depends on your own efforts.</p>
<p>Referee Ni Xiaoben blew the whistle to start the game. The China Aviation grieving team fought, and Gao Xiuqing and Yin Qingbing attacked together. Yin dribbled the ball straight into the hinterland and passed it to Xiao Gao, who shot low into the net near the goal, taking the lead with a score of one to zero. Qingbai was caught off guard by this loss and tried to counterattack. Liu Tiyin forced a low shot, which was caught by Xu Fusheng, and Liu Longxing's header also went out. At the thirty-third minute, Xiao Luo turned around and shot from 20 yards, hitting the post and bouncing off, hitting Xu Fusheng's shoulder. Xu lightly stretched his arm and caught it. China Aviation won the first half by one goal.</p>
<p>After changing sides, Qingbai worked harder, and Xiao Gu, Liu Longxing, and Liu Tiyin exchanged positions, but it was still to no avail. China Aviation put up a strong defense, and Qingbai's forwards did not bring their shooting shoes, so they stopped at this point. The two sides fought for a long time until the thirty-third minute, when Sanmao dribbled the ball far out and passed it to the left. Fu Naitang passed it to Xiao Luo, and the ball bounced back from the post. Jin Lusheng shot hard into the net near the goal and tied the score. One minute before the end of the game, Xiao Gao passed to Yin Qingbing, who went straight in along the side, passed the Sanmao pass, and shot into the bottom of the net. China Aviation then relied on this goal to fortunately eliminate the old champion Qingbai.</p>

<h3>Post-Match Comments</h3>
<p>In this Mayor's Cup, upsets have been repeated, with Longtou being eliminated by Zhichao first, and Qingbai being poisoned by China Aviation later, which are interesting to each other.</p>
<p>The Yiyuan field is extremely empty, and nearly a thousand spectators dotted it, making it even more deserted and miserable.</p>
<p>China Aviation fought with a grieving team, not seeking victory, but seeking to lose less. As a result, they unexpectedly tasted a sweet cup. There is a relationship between the team's luck. Xu Fusheng performed unexpectedly brilliantly, Gao Xiuqing returned to command the three armies, and Chen Jiaoping's help was also beneficial.</p>
<p>Qingbai gave one of the worst performances of the season. The forwards forgot to bring their shooting shoes, and each player was out of sync. Xiao Luo was nailed by Chen Jiaoping, and Jin Lusheng was not as accurate as usual. Since Afu retired and Xiao Fei went to Hong Kong, the strength of the forwards has been greatly reduced. Liu Tiyin, as a winger, likes to dribble a lot, and Xiao Gu has no cross-kick, so there is a sigh of talent on the right wing.</p>
<p>If there is another upset in today's battle between the Railway and Zhichao, and China Aviation and Zhichao win the Mayor's Cup, it will be a real upset among upsets.</p>
<p>The level of football is declining. Yesterday's game was muddy and watery, without any highlights. The audience did not move forward. To be fair, it was like a junior cup game.</p>
<p>The Football Committee took over the ball game after the victory, and the results of the first session were not bad. Since then, it has been getting worse and worse. Is it that after the extreme of splendor, it returns to plainness?</p>
<p>Except for Meng Yiliang, the rest of Qingbai are all young players, just like the incarnation of the previous Qingbai. It seems that A-Gui still needs to work harder.</p>
<p>Sanmao's performance was not weak, and he sat in the defense, like the natural moat of the Yangtze River, but the last goal he was responsible for could not be cancelled before. It was a flaw in the ball. (Mr. Shi)</p>

<h3>Basketball League: Huili Defeats Haiqing Again; Li Team Wins Again Against St. John's; Qian Sisters Excel</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Huili basketball team's performance is getting better and better. Last night's performance was particularly brilliant, easily defeating Haiqing 61 to 42, with the first half score being 33 to 14. Tian Fuhai, Cao Zhiji, and Wang Yongfang were all energetic.

In the women's division, Team Li defeated St. John's again in the second round, 53 to 29. In Men's Division Two A, Xun won the final victory, 50 to 42.</p>
<p>Women (4): In the second round, Team Li and St. John's faced off first. The bright red jerseys have become a traditional symbol of St. John's over the years. Team Li's light yellow jerseys further highlighted the striking beauty. Zhang Luoluo of St. John's had a smiling attitude when she shook hands with the opponent as a substitute, which gave people a sense of lightness, and can also be said to be an expression of "courtesy before soldiers." In the first quarter, Team Li led 14-6. Team Li's three forwards were petite and exquisite, making the defenders dizzy. The first half ended 26-17. The Qian sisters, Chuping and Youping, scored more points as their pigtails swung more fiercely. Lin Jingyi of St. John's showed fighting spirit in the second and third quarters. The third quarter ended 42-25. In the final quarter, Team Li, confident of victory, made frequent substitutions, bringing on players with various skills. The audience cheered when St. John's made shots. In the end, Team Li won again against St. John's with a score of 53-29.</p>

<h3>The Chalk Life</h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>When it comes to teaching, people always praise it as "noble." But we teachers feel that it is not because of nobility that we do this work. Honestly, "nobility" is just empty words, what is it worth? I think that if a person can willingly do a job and does not want to leave, the reason can generally be divided into two categories: one is because of interest, and the other is because of fame and fortune. Then, naturally, someone will ask: Is there any interest or fame and fortune to be gained from teaching? Covered in chalk dust, hoarse, day after day, year after year, in the end, you can't get an official position or earn a penny. What interest is there in this profession?</p>
<p>This is really not easy to answer in one sentence, so let me start from afar.</p>
<p>An individual is born with all mental activities demanding two aspects: receiving and giving. As people read books and come into contact with many ideas and problems, these things gradually mix, change, ferment, and grow inside you. You feel as if some things are always rushing out of you. You feel the need for people to know, sympathize, debate, or even oppose. In short, you are looking forward to a kind of outward venting.</p>
<p>We usually don't realize it, but in fact, people are more or less looking forward to a kind of venting. Some people are willing to lose money to run a magazine, some people submit articles everywhere, and some people are willing to sacrifice their lives in order to fight for the right to say what they want to say to others (called freedom of speech). In the West, there are many people who use various methods to run for a seat as a councilor, just to have an opportunity to stand up and speak, and have thousands of people sit and listen. If someone has been to Hyde Park in London, this situation will be even clearer.</p>
<p>However, none of these paths are more direct, easier, or more thoroughly reliable than teaching. Writing articles is a roundabout thing, and psychologically it is like talking to yourself, making it difficult to have the kind of reaction that makes you believe. Speaking to people often involves the danger of being booed and blushing. Even chatting with friends, I don't know if you have had this unpleasant experience: when you are talking eloquently and happily, you find that two friends have already fallen asleep by the fireplace, and another yawns and says, "Ah, let's talk about something else."</p>
<p>Only on the podium can you say whatever you want, and there are always opportunities. If you have knowledge, you can say it. If you have complaints, you can say it. You can praise a failed hero, or you can scold all the characters of ancient and modern times. Moreover, as long as you pay attention, you can see that under you are those young faces that have not yet lost their purity, with their eyes wide open, looking at you so enthusiastically and respectfully, listening to your every word. Except on the podium, you will never have a second such opportunity. Friends are not so easy to find. The masses will not be so understanding. You feel that the words that are pressing on your heart are constantly flowing outward, and you feel that unspeakable release every moment.</p>
<p>I myself remember once, when I accidentally mentioned a relatively difficult to explain philosophy of life, I saw many deeply thoughtful faces below me. When I accidentally turned my gaze back, I saw a sudden look of understanding and empathy on a face in the front row. At that moment, I felt like I had suddenly found a confidant in the vast sea of people.</p>
<p>To find a place where so many people can listen to you, and always be so attentive, so sympathetic, and so respectful, besides here, the podium, I'm afraid there is no other place. Only here can you fully enjoy this kind of happiness.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also know that I am doing a career that is needed for the survival of mankind. We are really not doing this work because of "nobility." Even if everyone publicly recognizes tomorrow that teaching is the most vulgar profession in the world, I am afraid I would still be willing to spend this chalk life.</p>
<h3>Humorous Collection</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Hat and Film</p>
<p>Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Perkins told a story. Once, she went to see a movie wearing a hat. Turning around, she apologized to the gentleman sitting behind her and said:</p>
<p>"If my hat is blocking your view, I can take it off."</p>
<p>"No need," the man replied, "your hat is much better than this movie."</p>
<p>Most are Poor</p>
<p>An elementary school Chinese teacher gave the essay topic: "A Poor Family." A daughter of a wealthy merchant handed in her paper, and the first paragraph was:</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, there was a very poor family. The father was very poor, the mother was very poor, their cook was also very poor, the doorman was also very poor, the gardener was also very poor, the coachman was also very poor, everyone was very poor."</p>
<h3>American Dog Consumption</h3>
<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>Cats and dogs are the two most common domestic animals. Westerners prefer dogs to cats. In the United States, an average of 57 out of 100 families own cats or dogs, or both. The total number of dogs kept in the United States is about 20 million.</p>
<p>Americans keep dogs as playthings and feed them very well. Therefore, the annual consumption of those 20 million dogs is also a very large number. Just in terms of food, last year's consumption reached 120 million US dollars. The total estimated consumption on dogs is about 7.5 billion US dollars per year.</p>
<p>Since dog consumption is so considerable, many businessmen have also moved their minds to dogs and specialize in selling dog supplies, such as houses, food, medicine, clothing, etc., which are all sold in the market. There are also schools for training dogs, hospitals for treating dog diseases, barbershops for grooming dog hair, etc. It is really thoughtful and meticulous. Fortunately, most of the dog owners are wealthy masters and ladies, and they don't care about spending money, so merchants who specialize in the dog business can easily make ten times the profit.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, someone launched "Dog Week," and since then there has been an annual season dedicated to dogs. In the beginning, only 500 groups participated, but last year it had increased to 3,000. There is also a dog-raising manual published, which is now in its fourth edition, with 5,000 copies per edition. In two months, 20,000 books were sold out. Starting last year, a dog's "Nobel Prize" was also established, with a prize of 2,000 US dollars, awarded to the person who has made the most contributions to the health and welfare of dogs in a year.</p>
<p>There are also many dog cemeteries in various places. In general, dog owners not only take great care of their beloved dogs during their lifetime, but also cannot bear to expose their remains after they pass away, and spend a lot of money to find a resting place for them. In Long Island, New York, there is a dog cemetery with more than 5,000 graves, each with a marble monument. The most elaborate one buries a dog called "Pamala Lin," and the grave is worth more than 1,000 US dollars.</p>
<p>It is better to be a dog in peaceful times than a person in troubled times. Seeing the abundance and luxury of American dogs, and then looking at the pitiful appearance of those beggars and women on the streets of our country, it really makes one feel that people are not as good as dogs.</p>
<h3>One-Handed Man</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the elevator, I noticed that the elevator operator only had one hand. His left hand was cut off from the wrist. I asked him if this was very inconvenient. He replied, "Not really, I'm used to it. I only think about it when I'm trying to thread a needle."</p>
<p>Obviously, it is not just the environment that makes people happy or sad. Our emotions are determined by our reactions to the environment. Everyone can overcome misfortune and adversity - if we must overcome, or we will perish. We ourselves may not believe it sometimes, but everyone has unlimited potential to overcome difficulties. We are actually stronger than we imagine, as long as we can persevere and unleash our potential.</p>
<p>The late novelist Booth Tarkington believed that he could endure anything except blindness. At the age of sixty, he unfortunately gradually lost his sight.</p>
<p>When he could no longer see anything with his eyes, Tarkington said: "I found that I could also endure blindness, just as other people endure other things. Even if I lost all my senses, I knew that I could still live in my own mind."</p>
<p>Random Notes from the Film Industry</p>
<h3>American and British Films</h3>
<p>— Wang Ce</p>
<p>Shanghai audiences are often immersed in the romances and erotic song and dances of Hollywood male and female stars. They rarely have healthy and energetic works. Even "For Whom the Bell Tolls," which is admired by young men and women in Shanghai, Hollywood screenwriters have obliterated the significance of the Spanish Revolutionary War and cast an American-style love net on the anti-fascist flames of war in Spain. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman's "intense and moving" and the American university professor's "courage and integrity" can indeed "capture people's hearts," but putting the focus of the Spanish Revolution on American-style individual heroism roughly reveals the purpose of Hollywood.</p>
<p>British films, on the other hand, have recently been relatively able to grasp a correct theme and write out the shape of this social development. For example, the neglected "The Way Ahead" writes about a worker who has devoted his life to the labor movement. He is very popular with the people, but when he leaves the people and accepts the position of Minister of Labor in the court, he is abandoned by the people. The contrast in the whole film is very strong and the meaning is very profound. If British films can grasp the film production policy, they can win over the audience of Hollywood films.</p>
<p>It's not that Hollywood doesn't have good films, but that's exactly it: "As rare as morning stars, can be counted one by one."</p>
<h3>New Life Design</h3>
<p>— Shaofei</p>
<h3>Black and White Distinction</h3>
<p>— Nian</p>
<p>A neurotic came to see the doctor and insisted that he had swallowed a horse and had to have surgery to avoid danger. Explanation was ineffective, so the doctor had to listen with a stethoscope for a while, and said that there was indeed a horse inside, and decided to operate.</p>
<p>The patient was carried into the operating room, used general anesthesia, and when he woke up, a large white horse had been placed next to him. The doctor pointed it out to him.</p>
<p>"That's not right," the patient shook his head, "I swallowed a black horse."</p>
<h3>Old Stories of Shanghai, Part Two: The First Vegetable Market in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Gu Qi</p>
<p>Today's Shanghai has decent-sized vegetable markets everywhere. But fifty years ago, there was no such thing as a designated vegetable market. Each street and alley had scattered vegetable trading. As for the wholesale place for hawkers, it was in Pentang Lane, Shanxi Road. There was no construction of a market place there. Only stalls were set up on both sides of the street, somewhat similar to the current vegetable market on Henan Road and Ningbo Road every afternoon. At that time, the old patrol house on Simalu was still in the place of the silk industry guild in front of Pentang Lane. Vegetable vendors were often arrested by the patrol masters of the concession era and taken into the "line" due to lack of licenses or insufficient "tribute", beaten and kicked, and their vegetables were also confiscated, suffering unspeakable hardships. And if they encountered wind, snow, or heavy rain, it was inconvenient for both buyers and sellers to trade in the open air, and there was nothing they could do. At that time, a merchant named Yang Zijing saw this situation and wanted to improve it, so he spent money to build a thatched vegetable market in Wufu Lane, which could slightly shelter from the wind and rain. Vegetable vendors gathered there to trade. At that time, people called it the Donghuang Market Vegetable Market. Later, the market gradually prospered, and the population of Shanghai gradually increased. The Public Works Department decided to build another large-scale vegetable market, so it bought the land in front of the Ten Small Vegetable Market in Yang Zijing's former iron house, and built a large-scale vegetable market made of wooden boards, charging one yuan per month for each stall. Later, because the wooden boards were easily eroded by wind and rain, they were changed to iron sheets, and the stall fees were increased to two to three yuan. In the ten years of the Republic of China, the base of the small vegetable market in the iron house was sold, and it was moved to the Fuzhou Road vegetable market. To this day, the Fuzhou Road vegetable market is still the birthplace of wholesale prices.</p>
<p>Speaking of the vegetable market in the Pentang Lane era, prices were still in cash. Yesterday, I accidentally flipped through an old newspaper from fifty years ago and saw the vegetable prices at that time, and I just randomly copied a few: firewood fifty cash per hundred catties, soybean oil thirty-six cash per catty, sesame cakes three cash for two, eggs four cash each, meat fifty-six cash per catty, fish twenty cash each, coarse cloth three hundred cash per bolt.</p>
<p>Today, eggs are nearly a hundred gold yuan each. A hundred gold yuan is equivalent to 300 million legal tender, which is equivalent to more than 900 billion cash. Such a calculation is truly like a world away.</p>
