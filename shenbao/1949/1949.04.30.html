<p>〔聯合社紐海文廿九日電〕前美國力院助理斐爾，廿八夜在耶魯大學辯論會發表演說，主張在中國採取新門戶政策，并由美國支持，成立一遠東貿易協定。欲阻遏中國共產黨前進所引起之擾亂，此兩種辦法實所必需。關於門戶開放，美國應與中國當局成立協議，在台灣，海南島及中國大陸建立開放區，其社會的及經濟的意義，應更重於軍事的意義。日本菲律賓及印度尼西亞與共產中國斷絕貿易後，必將發生經濟困難。美國應與粵洲協商，立卽設法與各該區成立協定，藉以安定局勢。</p>

<h3 id="c34">社論　速導經濟於正軌 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>經濟的變化，無論如何，都逃不開政治的現實，這次南京撤社後本市市場的反映，尤為具體而顯著，工厰無心從事再生產，商店不願多做生意，金融界停止授信商務，投機份子也大部斂跡，這一切的一切，顯示出上海經濟均已界均已陷於麻痹的狀態。因此各种交易無法做開，銀根緊馳不定，拆息高低參差，特價漲落的程度，也就極不規律，事實上大都是隨着「應變」的需要，而產生的鉅大的差異。即如前幾天米糧，然價格的獨步飛漲，金，鈔，大頭和一般日用品價格的慘跌等，便可以說明混亂中經濟的趨勢。</p>
<p>從另一個角度看，在這樣一個非常的局面下，因為「應變」「逃難」的緣因，人民對現鈔的需求慾更形強烈，而鈔荒現象的嚴重，也倍見普徧。所以，前幾天不但貼水創了四折的新記錄，即一般商品的現鈔價格和劃頭價格，也相差到一半以上，雖然現在中央銀行已發行了十萬元的大票，供應市場，但仍不敷市場實際的需要數量。故市場上現鈔和劃頭的價格，仍是有一條顯明的鴻溝。今日人民所受的生活壓迫，已經不輕，如要再加上這層意外的負担，不啻是雪上加霜，簡直要逼害到無法生存的地步了！</p>
<p>由於戰時心理的缺陷，各方面都顧慮銀錢界隨時休業的發生，因之市面上支票不通用，行莊本票不接受，甚至連中央銀行的本票，也被連帶的拒用，這實是增加當前困擾的一大原因，其實本票和支票，都是信用市場中代替通貨流通的一种工具，它們與通貨有同等的功能，絕不應與現鈔的價格有所差異，更不應拒絕接受，目前發生的畸形現象，可說是大家神經過份緊張下的錯覺！但是本票支票不用，現鈔籌碼缺少，一切正常的交易，勢必形成停頓的狀態，從而正當工商業亦必無法維持了。</p>
<p>還有近來物價紛紛改以銀元作價，并有許多食品燃料，僅限於大頭銀元的交易，金圓劵根本無法購買；但一般平民及薪水階級們血汗換來的報酬所得，只有金圓劵與本票，現在金圓劵與本票的使用上，既然受到了限制，則平民與薪水階級們為了避免飢餓的襲擊，只有適應不合理的環境，　忍受剝削，因此生活上也就打了一個大的折扣；由於一般生活上的困難和苦悶，更引起人心的懮慮，以及社會秩序和混亂，我們不知如此重大的事件發生，當局豈可默默無聞？政府原是服務人民的機構。服務人民，難道還有比這時更為切要的時候？</p>
<p>現在時局已演變到如此的地步，戰火已燃到眉睫，當局應拿出「快刀斬亂蔴」的手段，來處理紛繁的局面，要知今日不管大局演變到如何的程度，但安定民生，終是當務之急。我們所謂安定民生，也就是說要把混亂中的經濟秩序，導入正軌，恢復到以前的的狀態。故現在經濟上的措施，切須做到於民有利，避免人心受刺激的地步，如仍一味唱高調，濫開空頭支票的話，不管有什麼拋·抽政策，或其他的錦囊妙計，都難達到的安定民生的鵠的。</p>
<p>就目前情形而論，戰事尚未到達上海，而本市經濟秩序，倒已先陷於混亂的局面，這種現象，姑不論人民困擾和不便的程度如何，但整個上海的前途，恐亦未必能夠樂觀。再說政治軍事與經濟，原有互為因果的作用，而經濟影響於軍事政治方面，尤為重大。所以我們再提醒負責財政金融的大員們，趕快商討對策，打破當前混亂·緊張·不安的經濟局面，則豈僅上海市六百萬人民之福？</p>
<p>至於全市的工商業，在此緊要的難關中，也要羣策羣力，同舟共濟，才能維持自身的繁榮，如果大家潔身自好，只知自掃門前雪，而不管社會擾攘的秩序，則整個市面陷於停滯，一定是自取滅亡。況本市向為經濟的中心，全市產業工人有多少，商舖的從來人員有多少，一旦工商業蕭條之後，失業的嚴重威脅，一定是極為可怕，到那時不但整個的治安問題，無法維持，即工商業的基礎，也要發生動搖的現象。故在此「山雨欲來風滿樓」的沉閟問題，如統一現鈔·劃頭的價格，穩定燃料及主要食用品的價格，接受本票與現鈔的買賣，暨行莊恢復厰商資金的融通等。總之，人類因互助而自助，因共存而共榮，倘使大家泯除恐慌的心理，精誠合作，那未人民的經濟生活，才能納入正軌；經濟穩定，社會的亂象，自然也可消除了。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕美國國務卿艾契遜今日向此間英國報紙發行人協會發表演說，提出美國政府認為為解決德國問題所必要的三項原則。艾氏指出欲使德國問題獲得滿意的解決，必須（一）繼續設立西德政府之計劃，及將此項計劃包括在德國問題一般解決方案之內。（二）得以保護歐洲全體之安全利益。（三）以和平及有秩序的方式，解決德國之未來。艾氏強調聲明務必能使西德人民確信美國政府不致同意不能將設立西德政府的基本部署，包括在內的德國問題的一般解決辦法。德人可以信賴美國，除非得有此項性質之一般解決辦法，美國政府將繼續強力支援西德政府計劃的發展。德國人民可心確信，美國政府決不同意不顧歐洲集體利益的任何有關德國的措施。同時美國人民亦可確信在任何有關德國未來的討論中，美國政府決不忘以和平及有秩序的方式，解決此一重大問題的前提。艾氏繼又述及美蘇間就柏林封鎖問題之討論，表示四強如有恢復討論之可能，則美政府必當盡力設法解決此一當前世界最嚴重的問題。但若美政府會同其他西方盟國開始討論關於西德之新措施之際，并非表示美國已放棄獲取得以適用於整個德國問題的解決辦法之希望，或美國已杜絕恢復四強討論之門戶，但係表示美國不願在設法恢復西德健全及有望條件之前，無定期等待四強就德國問題獲致協議。艾氏并未對蘇聯有強烈之批評，僅於述及西德經濟困難之際，指出此乃蘇聯企圖控制德國經濟政治生活之結果。在一九四七年末，蘇聯似屬企圖破壞任何不能使蘇聯控制德國經濟政治生活之解決方案，莫斯科及倫敦兩次外長會議之失敗，即為其證明，而柏林盟管當局之陷於麻痹，造成了不能容忍的局勢，德國在分裂之下經濟日陷窘境，幸獲美國之助，始免浩刦之發生。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿八日電〕本日當參院外委會繼續聽取有關四月四日十二國在此間簽訂之自衛聯盟時，奥斯汀發言贊成大西洋公約。在此項公約對美國具有約束力量之前，須以參院三分之二多數加以批準。國防部長約翰遜繼奥斯汀發言，亦敦促迅速准許該項公約。此項聽取意見係於星期三開始者，由國務卿艾契遜首先作證，預料此項聽取意見將繼續一個月或六星期。</p>

On the west side of Wujiang, on the eastern shore of Taihu Lake, over 40 enemy boats carrying over 2,000 enemy troops were discovered in Nanku Township on the evening of the 28th, sailing to the vicinity of Miaoqian (southwest of Wujiang South) to disembark, attempting to join forces with the communist troops moving south from Suzhou to seize Wujiang. In the vicinity of Ba 　and Wujiang, our forces have already made contact with the enemy. (3) Chen Geng's 14th, 15th, and 16th armies have infiltrated into the mountainous areas between Zhijin and Qimen.

Other invited gentry, such as Ningxiang's Zhou Zhenlin and Xupu's Chen Xialing, are expected to arrive in Changsha within days.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Changsha, 29th] The first step for the Central China Commander-in-Chief's Office is to move to Changsha. Some departments unrelated to command and operations began working in Changsha on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 29th] After the flames of war spread from Jiangsu and Anhui to the south of the Yangtze River, the military authorities here have made new deployments for the defense of both the north and south banks of the Yangtze River to adapt to the current situation. The deployment around Yueyang, an important town in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway, is particularly strong. Temporary methods for requisitioning labor and materials have also been promulgated to actively repair the Henan Highway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 28th] The Shanghai Great American Evening Post reported on April 23rd that a high-ranking military officer of the Central China Military and Political Commander-in-Chief's Office told a reporter from the United Press that General Bai Chongxi would withdraw his troops along the Yangtze River, and most of the heavy weapons had been moved to Hengyang. According to Central China Commander-in-Chief's Office Deputy Chief of Staff Xu, when interviewed by reporters, since the Chinese Communists put forward harsh terms for surrender in eight articles and twenty-four clauses, the central government has resolved to quell the rebellion to ensure political democracy, nationalization of the military, and freedom of life and speech. Wuhan is an important town and military hub in Central China. All city defense works have long been completed, and the strategic deployment has been properly arranged. The river defense is also very solid. The determination is to ensure Wuhan and will not be affected by the strategic retreat in Nanjing. The evacuation of the population and materials, military supplies, etc. in Wuhan is aimed at reducing unnecessary damage caused by the war and actively completing war preparations.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hengdian, 29th] Military report: The main force of the communist troops in eastern Hubei is now gathered on the line from Qishui to Songbu, totaling approximately 20,000 men, belonging to Lin Biao's 43rd Army.

The remnants of the 10th Column of the communist troops west of San 　bu on the Pinghan Line have retreated to the vicinity of Geputan after being intercepted by the National Army. According to a military expert, if the frontline officers and soldiers receive sufficient food and supplies, the National Army can exert greater power to reverse the war situation in Central China.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taichung, 29th] Central Committee Member Wang Shijie returned to Taichung from Taipei on the 29th. According to him: The Kuomintang's greatest enemy is defeatism. Since the breakdown of the peace talks, the government has been striving to eliminate this defeatism in three ways: (1) promoting internal unity, (2) preventing the activities of the Communist Fifth Column, and (3) strengthening propaganda efforts. Although the war situation is currently unfavorable to the National Army, the opinions within the government and the Kuomintang are becoming increasingly consistent and gradually united. If we can be more confident and exert our potential strength in the future, then defeatism can be eliminated, and the violence of the Chinese Communists will surely be destroyed. Wang visited Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Xikou for three weeks and will soon travel to Guangzhou.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The newly appointed head of our delegation to Japan, Lieutenant General Zhu Shiming, said to a Central News Agency reporter this morning that the war situation in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is not as unfavorable to the National Army as generally imagined. The National Army's withdrawal from Nanjing was carried out according to the original plan. Zhu pointed out that the orderly retreat of the National Army from Nanjing and its surrounding areas showed that the National Army had not suffered any losses. He hinted that any attempt by the Communist troops to attack Shanghai would be met with strong resistance from the National Army. Zhu refused to discuss the entire operational plan, stating that this plan had been drawn up by senior officials of the Ministry of National Defense. When asked why the navy was not fully active in the Yangtze River campaign, he replied that the navy was helpless under the range of communist artillery fire on the north bank. Zhu believed that the air force could have engaged in more active activities in this battle. Zhu expressed regret for the inaccurate news reported by some foreign reporters, which promoted the Communist cause. He said that the Communist Party had secret agents in Shanghai to supply foreign reporters with rumors that were sufficient to disturb people's hearts and cause panic as new news material.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Truman, Acheson, and Two Senators Discuss Current Situation in China; Bridges and Wiley Both Advocate Increasing Aid to China; Nolan Urges Rapid Establishment of a Constructive Policy Toward the Far East <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 28th] Senator Bridges of New Hampshire and Senator Wiley of Nebraska discussed the situation in China with President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson for 45 minutes today. Both Bridges and Wiley are key Republican figures in the Senate who have criticized the United States' policy toward China.</p>
<p>Bridges is a key Republican member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Wiley is the Senate Republican leader. Both have strongly criticized the government's China policy and have advocated for the United States to increase aid to the National Government to fight against the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when reporters asked the two senators questions, both said that they did not feel they had the right to reveal what conclusions were reached, but Wiley said that the reports he received were very helpful to him, allowing him "to try to understand things that I did not understand before."</p>
<p>Later, when reporters asked the Secretary of State questions, Acheson said that there was nothing else to report except what the two senators had already said.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Senator Nolan accused the State Department today of building an iron curtain around US policy toward China and renewed his call for an expedited investigation into US foreign policy in the Far East.</p>
<p>Nolan read to the Senate a letter he sent to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, requesting that hearings be held as soon as possible on his proposed resolution calling for the establishment of a special joint committee of both houses of Congress to study the situation in China. The letter stated, "In view of the rapid deterioration of the overall situation in China, I believe that this country can no longer delay the establishment of a constructive policy toward the Far East. If we wait for the situation to clear up, the result will likely be the communist conquest of all of Asia. No member of Congress has ever seen Wallace's report on China after his trip to China as Vice President in 1944. The rumor that 90% or more of the military aid given by the United States to China has fallen into the hands of the Communist Party is an example of incorrect thinking, in which those who are ill-informed have secretly undermined the attempt to aid the Chinese government.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Phil and Gorlick Both Advocate Adopting a New Open Door Policy <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New Haven, 29th] Former Assistant Secretary of the Army Phil gave a speech at a Yale University debate on the 28th, advocating the adoption of a new Open Door Policy in China and the establishment of a Far East Trade Agreement supported by the United States. These two measures are necessary to curb the disturbances caused by the advance of the Chinese Communist Party. Regarding the Open Door, the United States should reach an agreement with the Chinese authorities to establish open areas in Taiwan, Hainan Island, and mainland China, whose social and economic significance should be greater than their military significance. Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia will face economic difficulties after cutting off trade with Communist China. The United States should consult with Guangzhou and immediately seek to reach agreements with these regions in order to stabilize the situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Former State Department official and government consultant Gorlick submitted a report to the National Policy Planning Association's State Council Committee on the 28th, advocating that the United States reaffirm and draft a new Open Door Policy to trade with the Chinese Communists, saying that if the United States adopts an attitude of friendship, assistance, and non-interference, it may be able to prevent China from being controlled by the Soviet Union. The United States should continue to provide reasonable assistance to the areas controlled by the Chinese Kuomintang government, but should no longer provide military assistance. Gorlick advocated restoring the Open Door Policy advocated by John Hay, implementing the following four points: (1) Insisting on China's territorial integrity and right to self-determination; (2) Restoring international trade when the situation improves; (3) Providing China with technical and economic assistance to improve its standard of living; (4) Striving to promote private medical schools and missionary programs. Gorlick also stated that the United States and China share common interests, both wanting to suppress Soviet imperialism, permanently limit Japanese power to its home islands, and maintain the philosophy of international life.</p>
<h3 id="e15">US Navy Remains in Wusong, Preparing to Evacuate US Nationals from Shanghai <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] President Truman stated that the US Navy is fully prepared to evacuate all US nationals in Shanghai. He solemnly denied reports that the US Navy had fled when US nationals in Shanghai felt threatened by the Communist Party, saying that there was no such thing, and that the US Navy was fulfilling its duties in Shanghai and was prepared to evacuate all US nationals at any time. There were still vacancies on the Wilson, which sailed from Shanghai, and the Pierce and Van Buren were also available for evacuation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] The Navy Department announced on the 28th that three landing craft capable of carrying 1,800 people are on standby in Shanghai to evacuate US nationals who wish to leave Shanghai.

<h3 id="e34">Editorial: Quickly Guide the Economy Back on Track <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Economic changes, no matter what, cannot escape the reality of politics. The reaction of the market in this city after the withdrawal from Nanjing is particularly concrete and significant. Factories have no intention of engaging in reproduction, shops are unwilling to do more business, the financial community has stopped providing credit to businesses, and speculators have mostly disappeared. All of this shows that Shanghai's economy has fallen into a state of paralysis. As a result, various transactions cannot be carried out, the money market is tight and unpredictable, and the discount rates vary widely. In fact, most of the large differences are generated by the need to "adapt to changes." For example, the skyrocketing prices of rice and grain in the past few days, as well as the dramatic drop in the prices of gold, banknotes, silver dollars, and general daily necessities, can illustrate the economic trends in the chaos.</p>
<p>From another perspective, in such an extraordinary situation, due to the reasons of "adapting to changes" and "escaping from disaster," the people's desire for cash has become stronger, and the shortage of banknotes has become even more widespread. Therefore, a few days ago, not only did the discount rate create a new record of 40%, but the cash price and the check price of general commodities also differed by more than half. Although the Central Bank has now issued large banknotes of 100,000 yuan to supply the market, it is still not enough to meet the actual needs of the market. Therefore, there is still a clear gap between the price of cash and the price of checks in the market. The pressure of life on the people today is already not light. If we add this unexpected burden, it is tantamount to adding frost to snow, and it is simply forcing people to the point where they cannot survive!</p>
<p>Due to the deficiencies of wartime psychology, all parties are worried about the possible closure of banks and money shops at any time. As a result, checks are not generally used in the market, bank drafts are not accepted, and even bank drafts from the Central Bank are rejected. This is actually a major reason for increasing the current difficulties. In fact, bank drafts and checks are both tools in the credit market that replace the circulation of currency. They have the same function as currency and should not have any price difference from cash, let alone be rejected. The abnormal phenomenon that is occurring now can be said to be a misconception under everyone's excessive tension! However, if bank drafts and checks are not used, and cash is in short supply, all normal transactions will inevitably be in a state of stagnation, and legitimate industry and commerce will inevitably be unable to maintain themselves.</p>
<p>Moreover, recently, prices have been quoted in silver dollars, and many foods and fuels are limited to transactions in silver dollars. Gold yuan notes cannot be used to buy them at all. However, the rewards and income that ordinary people and salaried classes have earned through hard work are only gold yuan notes and bank drafts. Now that the use of gold yuan notes and bank drafts has been restricted, ordinary people and salaried classes, in order to avoid the attack of hunger, can only adapt to the unreasonable environment and endure exploitation, so their lives have been greatly discounted. Due to the difficulties and bitterness in general life, people's anxieties, as well as social order and chaos, have been caused. We do not know how such a major event has occurred, and how the authorities can remain silent? The government is originally an institution that serves the people. Is there any time more important than now to serve the people?</p>
<p>Now that the situation has evolved to such a point, and the flames of war are burning at our eyebrows, the authorities should take the "quick knife to cut the tangled hemp" approach to deal with the complex situation. We must know that today, no matter how the overall situation evolves, stabilizing people's livelihoods is the top priority. What we call stabilizing people's livelihoods is to guide the chaotic economic order back on track and restore it to its previous state. Therefore, economic measures must be beneficial to the people and avoid stimulating people's hearts. If we still sing high-profile tunes and issue blank checks, no matter what throwing or drawing policies or other clever tricks we have, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>In the current situation, the war has not yet reached Shanghai, but the economic order of this city has already fallen into chaos. Regardless of the degree of distress and inconvenience to the people, the future of the entire Shanghai may not be optimistic. Furthermore, political, military, and economic affairs have a mutual cause-and-effect relationship, and the economic impact on military and political affairs is particularly significant. Therefore, we remind the officials in charge of finance and banking to quickly discuss countermeasures to break the current chaotic, tense, and uneasy economic situation. Wouldn't that be a blessing not only for the six million people of Shanghai?</p>
<p>As for the city's industry and commerce, in this critical and difficult situation, we must work together with one heart and one mind to maintain our own prosperity. If everyone cares only about their own affairs and ignores the disturbing order of society, then the entire market will fall into stagnation, which will certainly be self-defeating. Moreover, this city has always been the economic center. How many industrial workers are there in the city, and how many employees are there in the shops? Once industry and commerce are depressed, the serious threat of unemployment will certainly be extremely terrible. At that time, not only will the entire public security problem be impossible to maintain, but the foundation of industry and commerce will also be shaken. Therefore, in this depressing problem of "the wind is filling the tower before the mountain rain comes," such as unifying the prices of cash and checks, stabilizing the prices of fuel and main food products, accepting the buying and selling of bank drafts and cash, and restoring the financing of manufacturers by money shops, etc. In short, human beings help themselves through mutual assistance, and prosper together through coexistence. If everyone eliminates the psychology of panic and cooperates sincerely, then the people's economic life can be brought back on track; with economic stability, social chaos can naturally be eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Seeking a Comprehensive Solution to the German Problem, the United States Insists on Three Basic Principles, Guaranteeing the Protection of the Interests of the West German People and Taking into Account European Peace and Security <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 28th] U.S. Secretary of State Acheson delivered a speech to the association of British newspaper publishers here today, outlining three principles that the U.S. government believes are necessary to resolve the German problem. Acheson pointed out that in order for the German problem to be satisfactorily resolved, it must (1) continue the plan to establish a West German government and include this plan in the general solution to the German problem; (2) be able to protect the security interests of the entire Europe; and (3) resolve the future of Germany in a peaceful and orderly manner. Acheson emphasized the need to reassure the West German people that the U.S. government would not agree to a general solution to the German problem that did not include the basic deployment of establishing a West German government. The Germans can trust the United States that unless there is a general solution of this nature, the U.S. government will continue to strongly support the development of the West German government plan. The German people can be assured that the U.S. government will not agree to any measures concerning Germany that disregard the collective interests of Europe. At the same time, the American people can also be assured that in any discussions concerning the future of Germany, the U.S. government will never forget the premise of resolving this major issue in a peaceful and orderly manner. Acheson then mentioned the discussions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Berlin blockade, expressing that if there is a possibility of resuming discussions among the four powers, the U.S. government must do its best to resolve this most serious problem in the world today. However, when the U.S. government, together with other Western allies, begins to discuss new measures regarding West Germany, it does not mean that the U.S. has given up hope of obtaining a solution applicable to the entire German problem, or that the U.S. has closed the door to resuming discussions among the four powers, but it means that the U.S. is unwilling to wait indefinitely for the four powers to reach an agreement on the German problem before seeking to restore West Germany to a sound and promising condition. Acheson did not strongly criticize the Soviet Union, but only pointed out, when mentioning West Germany's economic difficulties, that this was the result of the Soviet Union's attempt to control Germany's economic and political life. At the end of 1947, the Soviet Union seemed to be trying to undermine any solution that would not allow the Soviet Union to control Germany's economic and political life. The failure of the two foreign ministers' meetings in Moscow and London proves this, and the paralysis of the Allied Control Authority in Berlin has created an intolerable situation. Germany's economy has been increasingly in dire straits due to the division. Fortunately, with the help of the United States, it has been spared from a major disaster.</p>

Earlier this morning, Soviet Representative Malik telephoned U.S. Representative Jessup to arrange a meeting at Malik's office at 4 p.m. (8 p.m. Coordinated Universal Time). It is reported that Malik has received new instructions from Moscow regarding the lifting of the blockade and the convening of a four-power foreign ministers' conference.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 29th Broadcast: British officials have made cautious predictions, saying that if things go smoothly, the Berlin blockade may be lifted within two weeks. Although London officials recognize that the Soviet Union can still change its attitude at the last minute, they are optimistic about the future of the negotiations.</p>
<p>[Reuters Success Lake, 28th] Spokespersons for Western powers emphasized that before the Foreign Ministers' Conference can be convened, the details of lifting the Berlin blockade should be drafted first. The three powers also hope that the Soviet Union can guarantee that it will not quibble over the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is also learned that the memorandum submitted by the three powers to Soviet Representative Malik yesterday also attempts to obtain the Soviet Union's explanation on the following points: (1) The convening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference will not delay the establishment of the West German Republic; (2) Before the convening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, all trade and transportation restrictions should be lifted; (3) If an agreement is reached on the aforementioned point C, a four-power conference can be convened to prepare the agenda for the Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is generally believed that after Moscow officially confirms the first three understandings, talks can be held in New York to discuss the details of lifting the blockade. Those involved expect that the Foreign Ministers' Conference can be convened in Paris after May.</p>

<p>[U.S. Information Service Washington, 28th] Jessup, Ambassador-at-Large of the United States, affirmed that the foreign policy he pursues places the primary emphasis on resolving all international disputes through peaceful means. Jessup stated firmly in a speech delivered to the American Society of International Law here tonight, "Whenever there are international frictions or disputes, governments, in joint or individual actions, may adopt any of four policies. (1) They may ignore the problem, which is a policy of isolationism or a distorted neutrality. (2) They may stimulate or encourage conflict, which is a policy of international disruption or sabotage. (3) They may seek to suppress conflict by force, which is a policy of domination. In the current stage of world transactions, this policy often cannot take the form of international police action. (4) They may seek to mediate conflict through international cooperation, which is the policy of the United Nations and also the policy of the United States." This American politician commented that efforts to seek international cooperation in the political realm are often not moving enough. However, he said, "We understand that unless we find another way out besides war, we cannot prevent war. We know that the way out besides war includes fundamentally improving the international situation, draining the stagnant pools where the bacteria of war grow, or turning them into reservoirs of life. We know that in the first living human society, there will be disagreements, and these disagreements must be adjusted."</p>

<p>[Reuters New York, Flushing Meadow, 29th] The United Nations General Assembly debated yesterday on suggestions to promote international cooperation in the political field. The General Assembly discussed several resolutions passed by the former small-scale General Assembly, one of which was to restore the 1928 League of Nations' law on the peaceful resolution of disputes, and another was to recommend to the Security Council that when disputes arise over the election of directors as mediators, the Security Council should seek mediation to reach an agreement. These resolutions were strongly opposed by the Soviet Union and Slavic countries, as the Soviet Union and other countries firmly believe that the small-scale General Assembly is an illegal organization.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Austin and Johnson Strongly Urge Approval of the Atlantic Treaty and Testify Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service Washington, 28th] Today, as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee continued to hear opinions regarding the alliance of self-defense signed by twelve countries here on April 4, Austin spoke in favor of the Atlantic Treaty. Before this treaty has binding force on the United States, it must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Senate. Secretary of Defense Johnson spoke after Austin and also urged the prompt approval of the treaty. These hearings began on Wednesday, with Secretary of State Acheson first testifying, and it is expected that these hearings will continue for a month or six weeks.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 28th] U.S. Representative to the United Nations Austin stated today when testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the Atlantic Treaty that as the non-communist world's opposition to communist forces increases daily, the forces supporting peaceful development have gradually gained the upper hand. The Atlantic Treaty is nothing less than a barrier, enabling the Atlantic region to more quickly achieve the goals and policies of the United Nations. The majority of the world is attempting to establish a collective security system within the United Nations, but the Soviet Union is attempting to seek its own security through a policy of territorial expansion. These feudal security ideas will cast a dark shadow over Eastern Europe. Fortunately, the United Nations, with the support of the United States, is carrying out decisive efforts to prevent Iran, Greece, and Korea from falling into the dark shadow. Austin also emphasized that the Atlantic Treaty will never replace the United Nations or weaken its position, nor does it represent the restoration of the balance of power system. The treaty can give the principle of peace a position above all else.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 28th] Secretary of Defense Johnson stated his opinion today before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, requesting the passage of a $1.13 billion military aid plan for the Atlantic Treaty countries. It is said that the treaty alone cannot achieve the goal of safeguarding peace unless the treaty is fully implemented and the peace forces in the treaty will be damaged. Once war occurs, we will pay an unlimited price, because we do not issue the treaty.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Letter to Party Members from the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Canton, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] In order to strictly adhere to President Chiang's statement on the 27th, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang issued a letter to all party members, calling on all party members to unite sincerely, strive hard, and vow to contend with the Chinese Communist Party to save the country and protect the party, to comfort the spirits of the Premier and the martyrs in heaven. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"A Letter to All Party Members from the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on Saving the Country and Protecting the Party through War against the Communists: Since April 1st, when the representatives of our government and the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party held peace talks in Peiping, compatriots across the country have hoped that peace would begin from then on. The sincerity of our party for peace talks and the four principles of peace talks solemnly decided upon were officially announced on the 18th of this month. Entrusted by the people and our party, the government authorities have not hesitated to endure all kinds of humiliation and burdens, and have been subjected to all kinds of unreasonable ridicule and slander from the Chinese Communist Party, hoping that sincerity would prevail and move even metal and stone. We only seek to enable the people to achieve peace and the country to be guaranteed. Then any sacrifice of party members will not be considered. Unexpectedly, the Chinese Communist Party revealed its ferocity and presented to our government representatives the full text of its so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement," consisting of eight articles and twenty-four clauses. As can be seen in national newspapers, it is even more arrogant and tyrannical than the Twenty-One Demands that Japan presented to us thirty years ago. If our government accepts it, not only will the Chinese Kuomintang and the Republic of China, which were created with difficulty by the Premier and the martyrs, be eliminated from then on, but also the basic freedoms and rights granted to the people of the country by the constitution will be deprived from then on, and they will forever endure the life of slavery in the Iron Curtain. Moreover, in Mao Zedong's broadcast, if a world war unfortunately occurs, our Chinese nation needs to prepare to be led by the Chinese Communist Party to fight for the Soviet Union, uniting the Chinese people to serve as cannon fodder for others. How can we face our ancestors above and our descendants below? Our Acting President Li and Premier He resolutely rejected it on the 20th of this month, and our party center also issued a statement on the same day to explain to the people of the country that our party cannot accept this kind of cruel condition that exceeds the scope of peace negotiations and harms the foundation of the people's lives and the country, and still hopes that the Chinese Communist Party will pull back from the precipice, lay down its butcher knife, and the two sides will first order a ceasefire and conduct another reasonable negotiation to achieve true and lasting peace. However, the Chinese Communist Party ignored everything and openly issued an attack order on the 21st. Under the eyes of the whole country, which is eager for peace, it launched a large army and continued to invade, forcibly crossing the river, attempting to sweep across Nanjing and Shanghai and conquer the whole country. In order to redeploy its defense lines for long-term resistance, our government was forced to temporarily avoid the fierce attack and withdraw from Nanjing, while simultaneously moving the entire government to Guangzhou to re-establish the source of resistance. To save the country and protect the party, we will continue the war in order to seek justice and the realization of lasting peace. All our comrades should know that the purpose of the Premier's founding of our party is to realize the Three Principles of the People, and observing the evolution of the world in the 20th century has proved that the Three Principles of the People contain the truth of human life today. It is not only sufficient as the foundation for our country's establishment, but also can be the direction for world peace. The Founding Father once told us that what the revolutionary party relies on for its survival is not military force or money, but the truth of ideology and morality. Our party has experienced thousands of setbacks and hardships in the past ten years, but it has been able to become more and more courageous and make continuous efforts, all thanks to the truth being on our side. Our party once led the people to overthrow the autocracy of the Qing Dynasty, eliminate the rampant warlords, and repel the invasion of Japan. All our comrades who died later who participated in these three battles, now that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to eliminate the history of our party, how can we fear its temporary military superiority and submit to humiliating surrender? We are now doing this to prevent the country and nation from becoming a vassal state of a totalitarian state, to prevent compatriots across the country from falling into the tragic situation of slavery, and to prevent the tragedy of mutual killing, liquidation, and struggle among the Chinese nation. There is only unity and adherence to the statement issued by the President on the 27th of this month, vowing to contend with the Chinese Communist Party, sharing the same hatred against the enemy, eliminating this evil, and ensuring that it no longer desires war and loves chaos. Comrades of our party have been influenced by revolutionary ideology. When the party and the country are in danger, we firmly believe that we will be able to rise up and be at the forefront of the people. Those who are familiar with military affairs will serve on the battlefield, those who have wealth will sacrifice their families to relieve the country's difficulties, those who can propagandize will awaken the people, and those who hold public office will strive for innovation. Where great righteousness lies, everyone should do their best. How can the Chinese Communist Party's military force exceed that of the Japanese invaders? Our party is capable of leading the people to defeat them. This is the confidence that our party should have, and there is no need to be discouraged in the slightest. As for the disputes that have arisen in our party over the past twenty years, and the conflicts between comrades due to differences in opinions and rights, creating certain factions, and personal grievances and rights and wrongs, at this time of life-and-death struggle and clear battle lines, we should all arouse our conscience, abandon our private hatreds, unite as one, and work hard under the leadership of our party to protect the country and the people. There are some comrades who have a deep revolutionary enthusiasm, but have been dissatisfied with the party and government measures over the years, or have made excessive remarks and actions. Now that they see the Chinese Communist Party is so dictatorial, those who have a little conscience should realize and return to the great banner of the Three Principles of the People. Those who are willing to contribute their revolutionary sincerity, love the country and are loyal to the party, who will be late to join? In order to guarantee the implementation of the Three Principles of the People and to save the country and the nation from danger, we can only unite in spirit and work hard to be worthy of the spirits of the Premier and the martyrs. The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, April 28, 1949."</p>

<p>In order to maintain operations and balance income and expenses, the Post Office will restore the pre-war standard of 80% of the fees starting today (the 30th). The pre-war postage for a regular letter was 5 fen per letter, and 80% of that is 4 fen. If calculated at the current prices, the postage for a regular letter exceeds 80,000 Gold Yuan per letter. In order to reduce the burden on the public, the rate will be rounded down and temporarily set at 40,000. Before the war, the postage for each regular letter could buy five large cakes. The current price of each large cake is 10,000, so the postage for a regular letter should be 50,000. Charging 80% of that would be 40,000, which matches the other calculation. The fees for other types of mail will be calculated proportionally, and international postage will also be adjusted at the same time. As for the rumor that postage will be priced in silver dollars, that is not true. The detailed fees that have been obtained are as follows: "Domestic" Letters: 40,000 for every 20 grams, Postcards (single): 20,000, (double): 40,000. Registered letters: Add 120,000 in addition to the regular fees; Express registered: Add 160,000; Regular express: Add 40,000; Airmail: Add 60,000.

<p>Zhang Yubingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, continues to insist on resigning to the Ministry of Communications because employees' salaries have not been paid, and it is extremely difficult to obtain cash due to the shortage of banknotes. Moreover, employees are waiting anxiously because prices are rising several times a day. The situation is serious and difficult to contain. Although repeated explanations have been given, they have been ineffective, resulting in being trapped for days and both freedom of eating and sleeping and the bureau's management order are disrupted. Therefore, he has insisted on resigning to the Ministry of Communications.</p>

<p>The supply of rice is dwindling, and sellers are no longer as eager to sell as before. Sales at rice shops remain active, and prices have stopped falling and have risen again. In the South Market, white nongkeng rice is 8 million, thin early rice is 8.3 million, and early rice is 7.5 million, each rising by 2 million, all in cash prices. Transactions in the market are all converted to silver dollars (at 1.6 million at 10:00 AM), with white nongkeng at 5 yuan, thin early rice at 5.2 yuan, and early rice at 4.7 yuan, an increase of 8 jiao to 1 yuan. In the North Market, white nongkeng is 5 yuan, converted to 7 million in cash at a rate of 1.4 million.</p>
<p>Due to continuous declines, the price of edible oil is very low. Sellers are less willing to sell, but sales in this area are very active. With supply falling short of demand, prices have risen across the board. Converted to silver dollars at the banknote price, soybean oil was initially 20 yuan, but fell back to 18 yuan due to the increase in silver dollars. Rapeseed oil was 18 yuan to 15 yuan, each rising by 2.5 yuan to 3 yuan. Crude oil was 19 yuan to 17 yuan. Calculated at the banknote price, crude oil was 56 million, a huge increase of 80%.</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was characterized by a loose money supply and strong confidence. Buyers were eager, and rumors of soaring gold banknotes reversed the sluggishness of the previous days and rapidly caught up. Bingchuan opened at 2.6 million in the morning, and the later market reached 2.8 million, equivalent to 1.4 silver dollars, almost doubling the price of the previous day. Lao Che reached 3.2 million in the later market, equivalent to 1.6 silver dollars. Wheat bran was firm. Daxin opened at 2 million for a large bag in the morning, and the later market shouted for 2.4 million (worth 1.2 silver dollars).</p>
<p>The price of coarse grains rose even more, with soybeans jumping by 70%. Sangyuan soybeans rose to 5.6 million, equivalent to 2.8 silver dollars. Sellers of raw peanuts held firm, and there were not many transactions. The market price broke the 10 million mark. Sesame transactions became more active, and corn rose steadily.</p>
<h3 id="e66">National Banks and Bureaus Issue 500,000 and 1 Million Denomination Banknotes to Meet Payroll Needs, Gold Exchange for Silver Dollars Will Still Be Handled <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to a responsible person at the Central Bank who met with reporters yesterday, there should be no problem in meeting the cash needs for payrolls at the end of this month. In addition, national banks and bureaus, such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, have issued fixed-denomination banknotes of 500,000 and 1 million to make up for the shortage of cash, and the Central Bank has also begun to issue them simultaneously. According to regulations, these banknotes are considered equivalent to cash and are circulated in full without any discount, just like cash. Supplemented by the recently issued large-denomination banknotes of 100,000, it is hoped that there will be sufficient chips to meet the payroll needs of all sectors of society.</p>
<p>As for the restoration of the method of exchanging gold for silver dollars, there is no problem in principle, but it still depends on whether various manufacturers have this need. It is estimated that the cash needed for payrolls at the end of this month is approximately 2 trillion. If national banks fully supply the cash, the need for silver dollars in various sectors may not be very urgent. If there is a need, national banks will still handle it according to the method of exchanging gold for silver dollars in the middle of this month, but the exchange rate will be determined temporarily.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from the East China News Agency] In order to ensure public security, the municipal police authorities have implemented the population census and evacuation measures. Starting from 0:00 AM yesterday, a comprehensive snap inspection was conducted. At 9:00 AM, the police bureau dispatched a rapid response team, together with detectives from the Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau, to conduct a snap inspection in the central district, including Nanjing Road, Xizang Road, Shandong Road, Fujian Road, Zhejiang Road, and Guangdong Road. The intersection of Xizang Road and Zhongzheng Middle Road was sealed off.

Du Chun, Chief of the Sub-bureau, asked Mao Sen, Director of the Police Bureau, for instructions on the handling methods, and it was decided that: (1) Those who actually have Shanghai Identification Cards but did not carry them and were arrested will be released after their families send the Identification Cards to the bureau for verification and sealing. (2) Those who came to Shanghai from other places without Shanghai Identification Cards will be handed over to the Population Census and Evacuation Enforcement Office for investigation. (3) Military personnel of unknown identity will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Gold Soars, Silver Dollars Rise Madly <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the gold market soared, rising sharply. Due to the Central Bank's large denomination banknotes of 500,000 being issued in large quantities, and rumors that 500,000 and 1,000,000 banknotes had already been printed, people were restless and anxious. The loose monetary policy showed no sign of abating, and all parties actively absorbed it, leading to a straight upward trend after opening. The price outside the exchange started at 8,200, then 8,700 in the morning, and by 11:00 AM, it had broken through the 100 million mark, rising to 130 million and 140 million at noon closing. In the afternoon, due to the concentration of speculative funds, there was demand without supply, and the upward trend intensified, reaching 160 million and 170 million, almost doubling from the previous day.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Yesterday, the US dollar market outside the exchange saw strong buying sentiment amid limited supply and high demand. It opened at 1.9 million and 2 million in the morning, rising all the way to 3 million and 3.3 million at noon closing. In the afternoon, bidding became chaotic, rising to 3.4 million and 3.7 million at closing, also about doubling from the previous day. In street trading, US dollars were being exchanged for 6.5 to 7 yuan, creating a disparity, making business difficult. There was still no official exchange rate listing. The exchange rate for new and old gold ornaments remained at 1.2 million per tael.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of silver dollars on the street soared due to the soaring gold price and enthusiastic arbitrage. Furthermore, with the end of the month approaching, businesses were preparing to pay salaries. Those holding silver dollars were universally optimistic. The price for Big Head silver dollars started at 1.7 million and 1.8 million in the morning, and approached the 2 million mark before noon, rising to 2 million and 2.2 million. In the afternoon, with limited supply and high demand, it rose again to 2.2 million and 2.4 million. Bids for miscellaneous foreign silver dollars were gradually leveling out. Small Head silver dollars were bid at 2 million and 2.2 million, while Eagle and Dragon silver dollars were bid at 1.6 million and 1.8 million. For transactions involving banknotes, Big Head silver dollars had already exceeded 3 million in the afternoon, reaching as high as 3 million and 3.5 million, an increase of about 40% from the previous day.</p>
<p>The gold and silver exchange ratio at the Stock Exchange Building fluctuated narrowly, starting at 33 and 36, then briefly decreasing to 32 and 35, before rising again to 33 and 36 in the afternoon, and finally falling again to 32 and 35.</p>
<p>Five major companies in the city, including Wing On and Sincere, used Small Head and Dragon Eagle silver dollars at the same price, posting a rate of 2 million yesterday morning, an increase of 700,000 from the previous day. However, they only allowed goods to be purchased, not cash conversions.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Chinese Stock Trading Lackluster, Chaotic Bidding Outside the Exchange <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Chinese stock market saw only bidding yesterday, with little actual trading. After the sudden change in the situation, financial items have been rising wildly, and the prices of various items outside the exchange are mostly calculated based on gold and silver. Although shareholders are worried about the overall situation, the Gold Yuan is depreciating daily, and the stock market has also naturally seen rising prices. The money supply in the market eased yesterday, and speculative funds flowed, showing signs of activity. Bids for various stocks outside the exchange were also quoted in silver dollars. The exchange has become a situation of prices without goods, and the transactions are only a formality.</p>
<p>Wing On Textile opened at the upper limit of 428.5 yuan in the morning, and other stocks also opened at the upper limit price. Until noon closing, few transactions were made. It is reported that only miscellaneous stocks Lian An Department Store traded 2 million shares, and Tung Yih 1 million shares. After the stocks in the exchange reached their limits, off-market trading commenced. Wing On Textile was bid at 26 yuan and 28 yuan in silver dollars, with 100,000 shares traded. Other stocks such as Mayar, New Kwong, King Fook, Keen Yew, and Shun Ho were also exchanged for one silver dollar, and some were bid with an additional 2 yuan. The popular stocks in the market had demand without supply, while only Wah Chi had some trading, with 1.5 million shares traded. No other trading was reported.</p>
