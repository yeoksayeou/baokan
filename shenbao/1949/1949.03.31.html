<h3>立院聽取和談報吿　鼓勵代表完成使命　邵力子不灰心·張治中感慨無限　蔣總裁表示不過問政治</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕政府和談代表團首席代表張治中，卅日下午三時許自溪口飛返京，略事休息後，卽赴立法院出席秘密談話會，報吿謁蔣總裁經過。晚八時各代表在張氏私厲集會，討論各項有關事務，秘書處人員亦參加。張氏並曾報吿赴溪口經過，至十一時始散，張氏復偕黃紹竑同謁李代總統，報吿溪口之行，午夜始返。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕蔣總裁對和談大計，決採完全不干涉態試用，聽由李代總統及何院長全權決定處理。蔣總裁並表示，渠決以在野之身，盡力支持李代總統，使和平得到成功，蔣總裁此項表示，係廿九日面吿代表國民黨赴溪口向總裁報吿和談問題之張治中者。張氏卅日下午返京後，即赴立院出席秘密談話會，報告赴溪口經過，張氏稱：蔣總栽在溪口，遊覽山水，意態悠閑，渠表示既已引退，決不過問政治，過去渠首先倡導和平，現則懇切希望各位努力完成。總裁與張氏出外散步時，面臨山前溪流，怡然吿張氏曰：「我已有四十餘年沒有在故鄉久住了，倘若和談能够成功，天下能够太平，人民能够安居樂業，我得終老故鄉，那簡直如神仙一樣了」，言時態度至爲輕鬆愉快。張氏並吿立委稱：蔣總裁自引退後，體重增加，過去爲一一八磅，今己一二五磅矣。各立委獲悉蔣總裁之表示後，咸以熱烈之鼓掌，表示無限之欣慰。卅日立院之秘密會，係於下午三時舉行，政府和談六代表均應邀列席，張治中·邵力子兩氏曾分別報吿，邵氏表示外間多謂其對和談悲觀，實則渠並不灰心，中共堅持八項條件，兩月以來政府有利和談之措施亦未能澈底實行，和談前途誠不無困難，但余肯做和談代表，即表示余並未灰心。邵報吿畢，即有立委侯紹文·張潛華·江一平·胡道遠·黄建中·楊公達·楊不平·吳籌人·鐘樸生·崔學禮等十餘人先後發言，綜合各人意見，除鼓勵和平代表完成使命外，並提出下列希望：（一）雙方先行停戰，（二）保持人民之生活自由，（三）應以人民之立塲爲立塲，不可只站在政府立塲。（四）應委曲求全。（五）軍隊國家化等。（六）和平應公平合理。各委員發言畢，即由張治中報吿，張氏首聲明和談代表係由政府指派，當受政府指導節制，但政府也是順應人民之要求，爭取和平，並隨時接受立法院之監督與指導，代表團決不會放棄人民之共同願望，當盡全力去爲國家民族努力。張氏對於兩年來和談之演變，今昔異勢，表示不堪回首，無限感慨。據謂：兩年前曾參加對中共之和談，但今日赴平參加和談之心情，已大不相同。關於和談之準備情形，張氏稱：在未談商以前，不便公布，對於中共八條件之具體對案，亦必須預守秘密，惟可得抽象而言者，如憲法與法統問題，憲法爲國民大會所制定，立監委對此均曾有集體意見發表，主張只要能够和平，可以不惜一切犧牲，各位既有此表示，則政府對各位之意見自當予以重視。沒收官僚資本及改革土地制度，早爲吾人過去一貫之主張，時至今日，尙有何人去爲豪門着想，但此　　必須有其方法，至賣國條約乃人人所反對，廢除賣國條約，相信必爲人人所贊成，但何者爲賣國條約，則須加以辨別，此五項均無何困難，另三條懲辦戰犯，改編軍隊及成立聯合政府等，較前五條稍難解決，但此項困難亦並非無解決之道，當努力求其有妥善解決。張氏報吿歷四十分鐘，態度輕鬆愉快，時夾以爽朗笑聲，各立委於四十分鐘內曾有十餘次報以熟烈掌聲，張氏報吿畢，童院長冠賢並起立向各和平代表致謝，並祝彼等圓滿完成使命，和談成功，迄晚六時許會議始散。（上海國代聯誼會，全國和平促進會對和談意見均刋二版）</p>

<h3>何內閣施政方針　立法院順利通過　質詢者僅四人餘均改以書面提出</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕行政院長何應欽卅日偕其閣僚出席立院報吿施政方針時，以出乎意料之順利，通過其就任後之最大難關。循例立委對新任院長報吿施政方針後之質詢極爲嚴峻，首任行憲內閣翁文灝即曾受審三天，孫科因係於宣布辭職後補行報吿，始得豁免。而何應欽所接受之質詢僅有四人，其餘五十餘人均改以書面提出，由何氏以書面答覆。三十日立院係舉行第三會期第九次會議，童冠賢主席，何應欽率各部會首長及參謀總長，海軍總司令等均準時蒞塲，報告事項後，院會即開始，聽取院長暨各部會苜長報吿施政方針，何應欽從容登發言台，宣讀廿九日政院會議通過之施政方針（全文見左角），歷廿分鐘即竣事。最後，何氏並謙稱，渠向任軍職，此次出任行政院長，決定實是求是，上述各方針，目的在求其實現，故未敢陳義過高，希望各立委指敎，詞畢，獲得不少掌聲。繼爲軍事報吿，由徐永昌·顧祝同分別說明軍額核實，役政及待遇改善，最近雙方兵力，共軍動態以及江防情形，均極簡明。桂永淸亦應邀出席，報吿重慶號等艦艇事件，謂渠已據實呈報，並自請處分。休息後開始質詢，要求發言者達五十九人，張慶楨首先發言，希望二點，（一）遵守憲怯精神，尊重立院職權，重要決策應先徵求立院同意。（二）保障人身自由，掃除和平障碍。（三）確實作到責任內閣，挺起胸膛，担當責任。高廷梓對施政方針提出三點懷疑及不同意之處，（一）所謂交通事業不再（完全）依賴國庫貼補，是否尙有（部份）須貼補。（二）關元之外，稅收復創出（稅元）單位制，花樣太多，人民不知何所適從。（三）財產稅舉辦時之技術問題，不可使全國騷擾，而應眞正作到全國有錢人出錢，渠並希望何氏用人惟才，施政方針應能兌現，改革須拿出成績來。周雍能促何注意勿令官僚投機份子混入，致造成貪汚無能之政治。武誓彭主張，（一）和平爲政府代表人民談和平，商談時應有最低條件，由立院作最後決定。（二）軍人精神敎育重要，仍應注重。經濟方面應取締銀行之投機。旋宣讀李霞天對整軍問題之書面意見，各委員主張書面意見應送何院長參考，不必宣讀，時已近午，主席徵詢會衆意見，尙有五十四人未及發言，是否延長時間，多數委員以時間決不允許人人發言，多主一律改爲書面，請送何院長彙答，經表決通過，十二時散會，何應欽及其閣僚亦同時離塲。</p>

<p>〔本報漢口卅日電〕安徽大學員生三千餘人，頃電華中當局，請求派遣輪船至安慶往迎撤離。</p>
<h3>中共軍現有兵力　總數約四百萬人　如和談不成初夏即渡江　顧祝同在立法院會中報吿軍事</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕參謀總長顧祝同，卅日晨在立院報吿共軍現有兵力，包括第一綫部隊及第二綫部隊·民兵等，共約四百萬人。顧氏稱：卅六年底共軍共一百九十餘萬人，卅七年底即增至三百五十五萬人，本年已達三百九十五萬人，其野戰軍共一〇六個縱隊（現改爲軍），一百七十萬人，軍區部隊七十七萬人，兩共二百五十萬人。第二綫部隊及民兵共一百數十萬人，長江以南士共約有十二萬人，屬於林彪者共一百五十四萬人，聶榮義·徐向前七八萬人，彭德懷廿七萬人，陳毅七十三萬人，劉伯承四十七萬人，土共十二萬人，分布蘇·浙·湘·兩廣等地，首都及下關附近亦有萬餘人。顧氏述及共軍渡江問題時稱：以純軍事眼光看，過江之部署準備已大體完成，俾於和談時向政府提出苛刻條件，如和談不成，即將責任諉諸政府·由前共軍之部署爲：蕪湖以東由劉伯承·陳毅負責，蕪湖以西由陳賡負責，聶榮臻·徐向前則在平漢西側，根據目前所獲情報，共軍渡江可能在初夏即四五月間。關於國軍之江防，顧氏亦予提及，據稱：江防係由京滬杭警備總部及華中軍政長官公署負責，湯總部負責浦口至上海，浦口以上由第八綏區負責，現江北口多已封鎖，國軍在江南嚴密布防，江北置有橋頭堡壘，掩護海軍巡邏江面，空軍亦廣泛偵察，此種部署與準備，相信可以逐日鞏固，共軍欲渡江，僅恃木船，江水上漲時，風浪甚大，木船渡江，並非易事，國軍將絕對嚴守長江，俾與中共進行和談。</p>

<h3>行政院施政方針</h3>
<p>一·前言</p>
<p>値此國步阽危之際，應欽受命出任行政院院長，才輇任重，深懼弗勝；惟上承代總統之提名，復荷貴院之同意，不得不勉膺重寄，悉力以赴。應欽向治軍事，素少過問政治；第默察當前局勢，非爭取和平，不足以保全國本；非革新政治，不足以起衰梂弊；非革新軍事，不足以衛國保民；非改良財政，不足以安定民生。</p>

<h3>關於生產貨款</h3>
<p>何內閣的施政方針於廿九日臨時政務會議通過後，何院長即於昨晨出席立法院提出施政報告，其中關於財政金融及經濟交通者，特別重視生產帶來的扶助，將採用四項辦法：（一）酌辦生產貸款；（二）增加生產採取重點主義；（三）獎勵人民投資生產事業；（四）發展農村副業及手工業。在全國經濟瀕於破產邊緣的今日，何內閣僅採取上列四項辦法，而欲達到穩定經濟安定民生的目的，固然是一個極大的問題；不過渴者易為飲，飢者易為食，全國的生產事業刻正陷於呆滯狀態，聽到何院長的施政報告，政府決將盡力扶助生產事業，自不能不認為黑暗中的一綫光明，尤其對於政府「酌辦生產的貸款」一事的期待最為迫切。</p>
<p>近年來我國生產事業資金的普徧貧乏，實在是阻礙工業進步的一大因素；然而政府數年來若斷若續的貸款，也曾給予了垂危的工業界不少的幫助。綜觀這幾年來所辦的工貸，名目上雖有生產貸款·緊急工貸·定貨貸款·小型工貸及收購成品等之分，但實則都不過是在年關左右臨時應急的一種低利貸款。最近當局除已頒佈了定貨貸款的十項辦法外，關於生產貸款方面，也正在着手草擬辦法中，我們願在這種辦法尚未公佈之前，提出幾項原則，以供財金當局的參考。</p>
<p>第一·貸款的對象　它是否是真正民主國防有關的工業？他們的產品，是否合乎一般工業的水準？他們的資金，是否真正感覺到缺乏？他們開工的情形，是否合乎正常的條件？凡此種種，事前都應審慎地調查清楚。</p>
<p>第二·貸款的標準　應該嚴格地規定，一切的一切均須以工厰實際情形而決定，切不可因人情面子或少數特殊分子的關係，便把貸款作為禮物，而使多數真正需要資金的工厰，反而得不到貸款。</p>
<p>第三·貸款的監督　中央銀行貼放委員會除了本身決定貸款以外，并須授權及責成承放行局認真考核所貸工厰資金運用的情形，及貸款前後生產情形的比較，那麼才能促進生產事業的繁榮，而消除厰商們倚賴貸款的惰性。</p>
<p>第四·貸款的押品　最好避免用原料，成品及半製品等，因為貸款的目的，是純為了幫助厰商們在生產過程中流通資金的不足，若以原料及半製品為押品的話，無異阻止了他們再生產的能力，甚至從「工不如商，商不如囤」的術語中，抑且促成了他們囤積的藉口，危害整個的國民經濟，所以我人生主張貸款應以房地產及機器等作質。此外，若為了保障貸款的安全，亦可另行規定由公會及殷實的二家舖保，連同保證。</p>
<p>第五·貸款的期限　仍應依據重工業及輕工業的性質，分別予以規定，在目前情形之下，幣值日夕動蕩，對於工厰們所需的長期資金，自難全部貸助，所以我們主張重工業類的貸款，仍宜以三個月為期，輕工業類的貸款，仍宜以二個月為期，到期時，視所貸工厰的成效如何，然後再分別決定轉期或收回與否。</p>
<p>第六·貸款的利率　不宜過份的偏低，而與市拆相近最為適當，因為目前整個的大環境如此，國家在萬難中抽出一部分力量來貸助工厰，原屬不易，若使利率過低，則不免造成少數人的利益，也是不合理的事情。</p>
<p>第七·貸款的手續　應力求簡捷，不要讓工厰們見了繁複的表格，便感到頭痛，也不要教工厰們在取到一筆貸款的時候，已感到與申請時的用途變質，沒有多大的幫助，所以為了經濟時間的關係，應該儘量減少許多層轉機構的延誤，最好由工厰直接向中央銀行貼放會申請貸款，手續上或較為迅速。</p>
<p>第八·貸款資金的來源　切不可再倚賴通貨的發行，加重全體國民的負担，如能根據各國家行局庫（包括中央銀行本身在內）自身頭寸的情形，辦理貸款，最為相宜。</p>
<p>以上所舉的八項原則，確是政府當局酌辦生產貸款所不可忽視者。目前我們固然同情工業界的處境困難，但當大多數人民猶掙扎在飢餓綫上的今日，我們對於國家流出的資金，自不能不講求獲得最大的效能。最好多辦定貸貸款，切實掌握物資；否則，亦須與有關各公會約定在前，有權指定他們產品的去路，以以調劑其他需要的場所，從而穩定供應的關係。</p>
<p>總之，今日國家和全國生產事業，同處於纍卵的局面之下，我們深盼大家體會時艱，遵循正確的原則去辦理，承辦貸款的人員，尤應特別廉明認真，使全國的生產事業均能受其實惠；同時產業界也要特別努力，以改進產品的質和量；如此，今日當局舉辦的生產貸款，才不會落空！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三十日廣播：大馬色訊，敘利亞陸軍於接收政府後，已逮捕大批官史，并表示將舉行公民選舉，以決定新政府人選。據一切跡象觀察，此次政變之用意，顯係企圖阻撓敘利亞與以色列議和。陸軍今日下午接收時并未發生暴烈行動，全國安寗如恒。政變之主要領導者陸軍參謀總長柴姆告新聞記者稱，此次接收政府係暫時性質，以待新的民主政權之成立。柴姆并稱，渠正與聯合國敘利亞代表兼敘議會主席柯里進行商談，俾立即建立合法之新政府。另訊，傳聯合國敘利亞之另一代表埃斯倫正負責組織新政府。柴姆并表示，陸軍此將行動，純屬內政問題，絕無外國影響。柴氏并警告稱，如有人欲乘面觀　敘利亞之疆土及主權者，陸軍當採取斷然處置。</p>
<p>〔路透社亞曼三十日電〕大馬色電臺廣播敘利亞陸軍總司令柴姆上校業已自任為獨裁者，并在敘利亞設立軍事政權。柴上校假該臺告敘國人民，聲明渠之接掌政權，係因局勢日趨惡化，并所以驅逐自命為國民份子之人物，在敘利亞確立民主政府以前，此項緊急措施實屬必要。該臺又發表柴姆發表之另一佈告，宣布全國戒嚴，并於當地時間上午六時起在全國各城鎮村落實施交通管制，至通告撤銷為止，按敘利亞有人口三百二十萬，為阿拉伯聰明國家之一，最近該國陸軍對於政府之與以色列簽訂停戰協定深表不滿。</p>
<p>〔合眾社開羅三十日電〕消息靈通之政治人士稱，敘利亞之政變，可能為外約但國王阿勃杜拉蘊蓄已久的大敘利亞野心的前奏曲。在倫敦之阿拉伯辦事處稱，「此不過為阿拉伯國家內同樣事件之開端而已，此顯然為巴勒斯坦鍋駝機的直接結果」。</p>

<h3>工業代表聯袂晉京　陳述南北易貨意見　攜有易貨辦法大綱等面呈何院長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市工業會，鑑于實現南北易貨之需要日益殷切，曾於上次理監聯會中推定代表十人，晉京向中樞陳述意見，茲悉：該代表等連日會商，並根據各業意見擬定易貨大綱，及開列擬行交換之貨物項目單，此項易貨大綱及貨品單，已在昨日下午舉行之工業會常務理事會中通過，十代表除一部份在京外，昨晚啓程晉京者，有劉鴻生·潘士浩·田和卿·洪念祖·蔡昕濤·胡西園·姚書紳等七人，將向行政院，經濟部，財政部，交通部面陳目前工業界之危機及南北易貨之需要。如此項建議能邀當局批準，南北易貨計劃在短期內卽可實現。茲將工業會昨所決議呈何院長之全文錄後：</p>
<p>竊惟各地工商業之營運，全賴貨物交流，互通有無，方能繁榮滋長，免於窒息，社會經濟榮枯，實亦消長於此。乃去冬徐蚌戰役，江北撤守，以及平津局部和平之後，我上海工業界因原料缺乏，銷區縮小，處境愈益艱苦，舉凡鞍山·龍煙之鉞，開潥·中興·淮南·華東之煤，鳳陽·許昌之煙葉，天津·永利之堿，榨油工業所需之花生·大豆，紡織工業所需之棉花·羊毛，牙刷工業所需豬鬃·獸骨，製革工業所需之生皮等等，皆為地域所限，無法南來。又如上海方面所製造之布疋·呢絨·染料·藥品·機器·輪胎·膠鞋·腳踏車·電燈泡·手電筒·油漆·毛巾·被單·內衣·搪瓷·鋁器·絲綢·膠木製品·調味品·肥皂·茶葉·五金·紙張，以及各種家用化學品等，向以華北江北等地為主要市塲，今皆無法運往銷售，雖或近在咫尺，以無客商往來，交易完全斷絕，我工業界處茲窘境，一面感於燃料原料之無法取給，一面又以銷路縮小，成品積壓，資金週轉不靈，被迫減工減產，而一般正常開支，又復無法減少，日益虧損，基礎稍厚者，已感不易主持，規模較小者，不得不紛紛停歇，長此以往，勢將同歸於盡。今幸我公出長政院，致力和平，挽救經濟，對於工業之艱難困苦，諒早在深籌熟慮之中。我工業界感於本身之迫切需要，爰經數度集議，研討磋商，據與華北江北方面，舉辦易貨，試行貿易，俾雙方產品，互獲疏通，凡交換出入貨品，皆以民生實需工業原料為度，俾免貨滯於地，致為鄰邦所利用，或繞越港島，徒耗物力。過去我方之粉易彼之煤，舉辦已有成效，航業界領袖曾往接洽通航，亦有眉目，最近報載通電通郵通匯等事，均在陸續舉辦，通商一節，倘能隨之進行，不但本會所屬八十餘種工業，一萬二千餘家工廠，數十萬從業員工之生活，獲得保障，卽我公日夕企求之和平，亦可獲得有利進展。此事在原則上倘蒙垂許，實施之技術方面，自應研擬具體辦法，以期周密，而利進行。茲經擬具南北易貨辦法大綱，及南北貨名稱數量表各一份，由本會推派代表劉鴻生·束雲章·楊管北·劉丕基·潘士浩·田和卿·洪念祖·蔡昕濤·胡西園·姚書紳等十人晉京，面陳察閱，仰祈賜予採擇施行，不勝迫切待命之至。謹呈行政院院長何。</p>
<h3>房租標準明可決定　參會各小組召集人曾交換意見　今訪市長建議儘量抑低</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市房租標準問題，經地政局，市府參事室等數度研討後，已屆最後階段，明日市政會議討論決定後，卽可公佈。參議員姜豪·張中原·陳培德·馬君碩·周濂澤·朱亞揆·葉翔皋·張學濂·姚抱真等，昨經與吳市長相約，定今日下午四時赴市府訪吳市長，分別代表參議會地政·社會·法規等三小組委員會，及房客總聯合會，向吳市長貢獻決定房租標準之意見。</p>
<p>前訂方案　計分五級</p>
<p>據悉：參事室前所擬定之房租標準計分五級，（一）戰前房租在五十元之下者，取其百分之二十（卽十元），乘當期生活指數，作為目下之房租。（二）戰前房租在五十一元至一百元者，取其百分之十五作為基數。（三）戰前房租在一百零一元至二百元者，取其百分之二十作為基礎。（四）戰前房租在二百零一元至三百元者，取其百分之二十五作為基數。（五）戰前房租在三百元以上者，取其百分之三十作為基數。上列房租標準訂定後，市參會及房客總聯會均認為過高，市民難以負擔，故曾建議市府請予按原定標準對折計算。吳市長則以房租標準經劃分為五級後，將來房客房東間難免引起種種糾紛，認為有慎加研究之必要，故上週市政會議中未予通過，決議交由參事室重行審查，於明日再提市政會議討論決定之。</p>
<p>各參議員　交換意見</p>
<p>為討論房租標準問題，市參議會地政小組召集人張學濂，社會小組張中原·葉羞皋·姚抱真·周濂澤，法規小組馬君碩·朱亞揆·及房客總聯合會參議員姜豪·陳培德等，特於昨午五時先行舉行談話會交換意見，一致認為房租標準事關全滬公民負擔，市府理應儘量予以抑低。渠等認為如市府對房租分級辦法覺得不妥，則可分為住宅及屋兩種。至於房租標準，將建議吳市長根據參議會第八次大會之原提案辦法，卽住宅用屋，依照戰前房租折合金圓券，每元取其五分，乘以當期生活指數，亦卽等於取戰前租金之百分之五作為底數，如戰前租金為五十元者，其基數為二元五角。而營業用屋則每元取其六分。此項標準，與參事室所訂定者相比較，相去甚遠，市府是否可予接受，當視今日與吳市長商討之結果而定。無論如何，本市房租標準，明日會議中當可決定矣。</p>
<h3>三月下期　生活指數　今日發表</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市生活費指數編製審議委員會，定今日上午十時在市府會議室舉行會議，審議並公佈本月份下半期職工生活費固定基期指數及環比指數。本期職工生活費指數係改善編製後之第一項，市府統計處正加緊趕編中。</p>
<h3>工人發薪　現鈔不致成問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於工人發薪問題，昨據社會局長曹沛滋稱，現鈔恐慌可能減輕，不致有嚴重情形發生。中央銀行對社會局建議之放寬廠商取現限額及搭發銀元與定額本票事，正由副總裁攷慮中。曹局長認為目前各廠商之嚴重威脅為高利貸，銷路狹窄，與營業萎縮，職工生活指數對廠商已不是大刺激。</p>
<h3>市府各局處　辦理假移交　市長月初赴杭遊春</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府各局處，昨曾辦理假移交，將各部門中已完竣之公事，及已辦未完竣者，均造具清冊，交由市府秘書處彙齊。據悉：吳市長定四月一日起，先行請假，月初離滬赴杭春遊，假期當為十日至半個月。假滿後仍將返滬，惟對市長一職，仍將堅決請辭。渠希望返滬之日，中央業經決定新人選，則可辦理正式移交事宜。又對各局長之請辭者，渠在本身辭職未獲核準之前，將不再批示。</p>
<h3>無頭碎屍今開棺再騐　偵查結果有兩人近似　認為可疑之人犯已受嚴密監視</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕謹記路無頭碎屍案經連日警局及有關機關之多方偵查，已獲相當成就，真相不日卽可大白。該案之偵查，係就最近失蹤人數中逐一加以研究，不斷縮小範圍。歸納結果，其中可能性較大者有五人，最後縮小僅剩二人，與本案偵查之碎屍頗為相似。其中一人係由常熟警察分局發現者，另外一人則為其他機關發現者。失蹤者身上之特徵，如身長體重膚毛顏色，身上疤痕，及皮膚病等，已有詳盡之調查，警局定於今日將會同法醫開棺檢騐，以確定被害者誰屬。如三十二塊屍身中有與特徵相符之處，則該案急轉直下，卽可破案。惟以兇手對於毀屍滅跡之精細程度而論，可能已將死者身上特徵毀滅，在此三十二塊殘骸中恐已無法覓得特徵。然如缺少部份與死者身上特徵部份相符合，亦足為有力之反證。至於死者之身份，據調查結果，死者可能曾有犯罪紀錄，兇手將其手指砍去，其目的卽在毀滅指紋，使對死者之身份無法確定。該案經承辦人員從各方面偵查結果，業已斷定為一仇殺案無疑。在兇手尚未就逮前，本報為慎重起見，暫仍繼續保持秘密。但可以斷言者，該案有關人犯，已在警探人員所佈置之偵查綱嚴密監視中，落綱之期，已不在遠。</p>
<h3>水堯臣在杭失蹤　警局正偵查下落</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州卅日電〕滬發現無頭碎屍案之前夕，杭市曾失蹤一名水堯臣之男子，鄞縣人，四十四歲，住上海天潼路怡如里廿二號。水於十七日來杭吊其師前浙省新聞處長孫義慈五十七之孝，十七日卽行失蹤。二十一日午謹記路發現無頭碎屍，水之家屬乃來杭找尋未獲，於廿八日在報上登尋人廣告。滬常熟路警局閱報前往查詢，疑為卽係碎屍案被害人，昨特由副局長王思祖偕探員朱雲戎來杭，今日向有關各方調查結果，認為水某可能卽是。理由據謂有以下數點：（一）體格魁梧，其長衫可合於屍身。（二）水之襯衫領為十六吋，而屍亦同。（三）水之腳有特徵，趾有疤痕，爪有灰斑，腳有濕氣，屍體指紋腳趾均被削去。（四）水之失蹤與碎屍案發現日期銜接。查水原為一富商，淪陷期間在滬南京路香粉弄口開大達錢荘，並經營出口貿易棉布等業。勝利後四年來無業。家有母妻各一，小孩九人，大女已廿一歲。曾有一蘇州姨太太，惟已死。平日與妻感情甚洽，出行必由其妻理行裝。十七日離家時，其妻未知其何往，亦未為其理行裝。其母則曾見其徘徊，深思點首。來杭後宿中正街華興旅館，衣咖啡色長袍，黑皮鞋，頗現憂色，要開一冷靜之房間。當開定廿七號後，卽問茶房對房廿八號是誰，答為經理。並以長袍押抵房金。十八日領得由滬匯款六萬元，卽赴孫宅吊孝，送禮六千。未吃中飯卽去。十九日晨八時對茶房謂前往紹興。在旅館二日，無客往訪，僅打一電話。據其妹水秀　云：渠身無行李，僅金表金鍊各一，襯衫金鈕約重七錢。迄今失蹤，杳無音訊。王副局長偵查後，卽電滬將水之衣服被墊帶局以供調查，並運警犬二頭來杭，後者已於今日運到，將繼續偵查。據調查：水曾與其妻吵架，後乃來杭。</p>
<h3>碎屍案出事地點　檢察官親自踏勘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地檢處繼偵查箱屍案之後，復於前日上午派由徐定戡·汪優琴兩檢察官，率同法醫及法警多名，前往謹記路齊　別墅，實地勘查，訊問該屍原發現人李長安，王德才及住於該地之魯籍難民多人，並向衛生局派駐該地之張曹兩姓看守夫等，就當晚經過情形，逐一調查，旋復至斜土路派出所詢問當時發現碎屍情形。</p>

<h3>受太平輪慘案影響　中聯公司員工呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中聯公司太平輪沉沒已達兩月，其善後事宜仍未完全了結，最近該公司全體員工以被難家屬方面種種舉措，均直接影響彼等生計，昨特假銀行俱樂部招待記者，由職工代表該公司賬務課長陳軼峰報告，略謂自太平輪慘案發生後，被難家屬向中聯公司提出之撫卹要求，計分兩部，臺灣方面有一六二人，每人要求發白米八〇〇石，上海方面有四一六人，每人要求發給三千五百萬元，如發出時指數變動，再比例增加，此龐大數目，在目前約合黃金五千大條，決非公司能力所能負擔。但中聯公司截至最近止，亦已勉力付出大部份，計有票旅客二八八人，每人白米十石，無票旅客九十六人，每人白米七石半，此外更在兩月前每人發過一萬元，共發四百人。渠表示該項款額俱係由全體員工分別在外設法挪借而來，故目前公司雖未破產，而職工已負債甚重。惟被難家屬對此猶不能諒解，除該公司安聯輪已在臺灣高雄為渠等執行假扣押，分公司辦公地址亦被侵佔外，上海方面家屬近更要求扣押該公司僅有之一般華聯輪，並擬組織委員會接收中聯之一切業務。渠等認為如此則全體員工生計卽將斷絕，債務亦無法償清，而公司對賠償撫卹等項自更無從履行，故渠等要求雙方卽日起應靜候法律解決，並提出八點呼籲：（一）請公司當局卽日停止臺滬兩地被難家屬代表之一切供應。（二）要求公司設法清付員工所負債務。（三）要求被難家屬勿再侵佔公司辦公塲所。（四）被難家屬代表應公佈隨領各項費用之詳細賬目。（五）今後公司付款，應經由員工代表監督審核。（六）今後公司與被難家屬有集會討論時，應準許員工代表列席，如有妨礙職工福利之事項得卽予否決。（七）公司應依法保障員工生計，否則全體決向股東會提出申訴。（八）要求公司澈查並處分臺灣方面主管人員失職行為。</p>
<p>又中聯公司員工家屬昨推代表去社會局請願呼籲予以援助。社局表示此事並非勞資糾紛，而係有關法律問題，非社局主管，僅允於可能範圍內從中協助調解。</p>

<h3>栽誣神父案　地院昨初審　中外五被告均推諉　庭諭加傳證人再審</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕栽贓誣害喬神父，勒索數萬美金之中外五被告愛蓋，克利柯，依列次，傑美及王顯章等，昨日下午由地院陳師荊推事初審。其中德籍克利柯，操一口極流利且相當極準之華語，對庭上直接答供，尤能運用各種語勢，表達其意向，一與國人無異。渠供稱在華多年，經營煤業，去年十二月二日被警局拘捕後，雙手被銬，押往喬神父家搜贓，據稱；喬神父私套外匯，當搜出鴉片紙包及美金，旋卽帶回警局獲釋，並禁今對外宣洩，否認有其他勒索詐騙等情事。其他三外籍被告愛蓋·伊列次·傑美通過翻譯官之供述，對被控各節，完全推諉不知。王顯章稱未曾一至喬神父家，惟知有一名Albour　之西人（在逃），曾用蘋菓煮成黑膏，形似鴉片，確有其事。嗣由被客人之一喬神父證實，渠被勒詐時，皆由Albour從中以法語翻譯，往返接洽，克利柯當日亦係被銬到家搜索。後經庭上更番訊問後，諭知加傳證人，定於下月八日再審，傑美飭交一百萬金圓現金保，愛蓋令隨傳隨到，其餘三被告還押。</p>
<h3>兩路準備明漲價　增加百分之三百　自滬至京特快頭等十一萬五千三</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕鐵路新資費決定於明日（四月一日）起實行，至所調整倍數，交通部尚無正式指令到滬。聞京滬區鐵路局已依立法院所定調整運價標準計算，新運價約增加百分之三百左右，客運基本票價每公里由廿元增至八十五元，貨運每公里由廿七元增至一百十四元，路局現已將此計算方法及調整倍數，呈請交通部批準中，若交部對上述新運價批準，則兩路客票價，推算如下：</p>
<p>京滬線</p>
<p>普通車頭等票價上海至崑山一萬五千五百元，至蘇州二萬三千二百元，無錫三萬三千五百元，常州四萬三千八百元，丹陽五萬六千六百元，鎮江六萬四千四百元，南京八萬二千四百元。特快車頭等由上海至崑山一萬八千五百元，蘇州二萬七千八百元，無錫四萬零二百元，常州五萬二千五百元，丹陽六萬八千元，鎮江七萬七千二百元，南京九萬八千八百元。對號座車頭等由上海至蘇州三萬二千五百元，無錫四萬六千九百元，常州六萬一千三百元，丹陽七萬九千三百元，鎮江九萬零一百元，南京十一萬五千三百元。</p>

<h3>重建閘北示範區　預算需五百餘億　一個遙遠的夢實現尚需相當時期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「閘北」這個區域，擁有每日吞吐十餘萬人的大動脈京滬·滬杭兩路火車站，吳淞江環帶西南，水陸交通，異常便利，「一二八」與「八一三」日軍兩次侵滬，首遭破壞，該區精華，付之一炬，徑界亦多湮滅，業主管業迭起糾紛，上海市政府有鑒於此，決定重建閘北西區，為本市土地重劃示範區域，先由上海市都市設計委員會設計使用計劃，製就閘北西區分區使用計劃圖，地政局依據是項計劃圖，設計土地重劃計劃，製就閘北西區土地重劃計劃圖，該圖計分七個鄰里單位，每一鄰里單位有學校及綠地，全區有行政中心，警察消防分處，并斟酌原有地位及需要，劃定公用碼頭及倉庫，曁京滬·滬杭車站等地，分四期建設，此項計劃及圖樣已提請市參議會審查通過，及呈請行政院核準備案，惟因經費困難，迄今未能實現。</p>
<p>計劃果能實現　可闢一新天地</p>
<p>據記者昨向地政局探悉：閘北西區全區面積二，五二六·六六〇畝，將來建設計劃成功，其中戶地面積佔一，二七五·九七四畝，鐵路用地面積二四五·二一六畝，公共建築及綠面積三二六·三八〇畝，道路及地方路六七九·〇九〇畝，整個區域之建設經費在去年「八一九」幣制改革時估計金圓券一九，二二二，〇〇〇·〇〇元，現在假使以三千倍計算，約需五七，六六六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇·〇〇元，五百餘億之建設費恐為現在中央政府及地方經濟力量所不逮。</p>
<p>此項計劃果能實現，確可闢一新天地，圖中所示者，住宅，學校，醫院，公署，商店，郵局，警局及消防處，車站，倉庫，自來水廠，道路，均井然有條。如建設成功，將為上海之模範地區。</p>
<p>道路崎嶇不平　戰事遺跡宛在</p>
<p>記者為要明瞭閘北最近的實際情況，昨天驅車前往閘北實地考察一番，越過鐵路，折入宋公園路，只見道路高低不平，車子跳躍顛簸得很利害，泥漿四濺，兩旁皆是矮矮的草棚，剛從南京路林森路來的人，宛如從二十世紀忽然摔到十八世紀，有些地方簡直不像路。靠近中山路一帶，空地很多，都是房屋遭了砲火以後，磚塊都被日人和本地窮人拆光了，夷為平地，現在則變成一大塊一大塊的菜園。</p>
<p>到了宋公園，是這一區域中惟一可以遊憩的地方。我們順便進去，到這革命先烈石像前瞻拜一番，宋教仁先生石像作沉默狀，像下有章炳麟的篆書「漁父」二字，像後有于右任的題詞：「先生之死，天下惜之；先生之行，天下知之。吾又何記？為直筆乎？直筆人　。為曲筆乎？曲筆天誅。於　！九原之淚，天下之血，老友之筆，賊人之鉞，勒之空山，期之良史，銘諸心肝，質諸天地」。像之兩旁移植跑馬廳對面的石翁仲二尊，翁仲已經過裝修，黑帽，白面，黃袍，煥然一新，但已看不到香火的痕跡。公園門警對記者說，門外縱橫的水溝，和高高的土　，都是昔日戰壕和防禦工呈的遺跡，益增蒼涼之感。</p>
<p>八字橋畔空地　大都已無業主</p>
<p>繼又折向柳營路，驅車赴八字橋，該橋跨橫浜河，東北通水電路，為由江灣到閘北必經的孔道，在抗日血戰中曾造成「八進八出」的慘烈戰，記者立在橋頭，想憑弔戰爭的遺跡，已不可復覩。惟見有很多新建的大屋，據當地父老講：在戰爭中橋的附近房屋，均被燒炸凈盡，夷為一片平地，因此空地很多，地形已變，戰後大都已無業主認領，只要化上十多擔米錢，隨便揀一塊空地都可以搭上房子，沒有人干涉。此種情形，在將來重建閘北時，地籍的糾紛必多。</p>
<p>從閘北巡禮的結果，覺得這一個殘破的地方，的確需要重建，問題是這筆巨額建設經費如何籌措？這許多棚戶如何處置？地籍如何整理？計劃是好的，實現此項計劃，恐怕尚需一相當時期。</p>

<h3>常州古墓踏勘（上）</h3>
<p>— 蔣大沂</p>
<p>三月十九日晚上十點鐘左右，申報館記者袁文中先生到同濟大學文學院見訪。那時吾巳睡了，披衣開門，將客人延接入室以後，客人吿訴吾他曾往常州南郊探視過一個新發現的古墓</p>
<p>並且帶回了這個墓上的一塊墓磚。他要吾打這塊磚上去鑑定這個古墓的年代。常州發現古墓的消息，吾已在前兩天的報上看到，市博物館楊寬正館長，同濟大學牟潤蓀敎授，都有意邀吾一起去考察一次，吾因爲上學期同學缺的課太多了，現在不願意再多躭誤他們的上課時間，所以遲疑了一下，沒有立刻去，現在記者先生已把材料送上門來，這當然極願意仔細地觀察一下的。</p>
<p>墓磚考察</p>
<p>這塊磚是長方形的：長三八·九公分，寬一八·七公分，厚六公分；一面有花紋，其他一面和四邊都沒有花紋；一角已微有破損。</p>
<p>有花紋的一面，是蕉葉紋配上四枚大錢的一幅圖案。蕉葉紋沒有葉中的「主脈」，還有點重壘人形紋的意味。大錢的圓形不太準確，直徑最長的地方是六公分，最短的地方是五·七公分，大錢上有四個字，很模糊不淸，這是因爲墓磗在土裏吸收的水份太多，磚質鬆軟，一出土以後立刻加以洗刷所造成的現象。在模糊不淸中所看到的一點影踪，是這塊磚面上的岡案，係由僅及磚面四分之一大小的一塊模型在磚面上連日四次而成，所以這磚上四枚大錢是一式的。吾和市博物館張子祺兄彙合了四枚大錢互相比勘的結果：四個字中最淸楚的是側邊的一個「五」字，在五字的對面隱約是個「百」字。在上方隱約是個「大」字，而下方却隱約是個「泉」字；四字的書法都在篆隸之間，而以「大」字尤爲模糊。</p>
<p>大泉五百</p>
<p>假使吾們的看法而不錯的話，那麼磚上所著的便應該是「大泉五百」的錢紋了。考「大泉五百」是吳大帝嘉禾五年所籌的貨幣，這座墓的墓磗上既著有「大泉五百」的錢紋，那麼它建造的最早年代當然也決不能超過孫吳嘉禾五年的了。</p>
<p>吾們再問這座古墓最遲可能建造在什麼時代的呢？考大錢五百雖爲孫吳嘉禾五年所鑄，然以之爲墓磚上的飾紋，却可延長到西晋。陸心源千　亭古磚圖繹卷十·十七頁所著的建興三年磚，便是西晋墓磗以「大泉五百」爲飾紋的一例。再就蕉葉紋來說，以之爲墓磚磚面裝飾的，也同樣可以延長到西晋。千　亭古磚岡釋卷九·九頁所著的永興磚，便是西晋墓磚以蕉葉紋配錢紋作磚面裝飾的一例。到了東晋，那不但墓磚以「大泉五百」爲飾，墓碑磚面以蕉葉紋爲飾的例子很罕見；而且墓磚的形式也漸變小了，和這塊墓磚之尙存一點漢磗寬大典型者不同。所以這座古墓建造最遲的時代，據吾的私見，也許是不會遲過西晋這一個時代的。</p>
<p>吾把這意見吿訴了客人以後，并且請客人將這塊磚捐贈給了上海市博物館。二十二日，中央博物院籌備處王天木先生到館裏來，大家又重把這塊磚仔細端詳了一番；并且用木盆盛了水，把磚泡在水裏，讓磚面上的飾紋顯現得更淸楚一點。這樣仔細端詳的結果，大家覺得說這上邊的錢紋是「大泉五百」，還是非常準確的。不過吾總覺得該找一塊錢紋淸楚一點的墓磚來看看，才可放心，所以乘二十三那一天，我學校裏沒有功課，和博物館楊館長又往常州走了一遭。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋疑　直系血親屬間　繼承及債務問題</h3>
<p>唐鳴時律師主答</p>
<p>李福福生問　編輯先生：（一）敝友王君家道平庸，昆仲二人，各自成家立業。彼等父親故後，將菲薄遺產，平均分析爲二，由弟兄二人承繼。兄將所得遺產二畝，暫時交母親耕種，代爲補助生活另用之費，弟則並無絲毫貼補。今其母因不務正業，性喜賭博。雖屢勸不聽，致負債累累，故其母若不顧弟兄二人生計，是否有權將該項產業賣去？（二）其母沉迷於賭博，致負債累累，弟兄二人爲預防破產計，可否登報聲明脫離母子關係？</p>
<p>〔答案〕（一）該項遺產，原應由配偶及血親卑親屬共同承繼。故分爲兩份，僅由兩子分受於法不合。但其母處分該項田地，亦非一人所可作主。（二）母子原無脫離關係之理，但其母如百年之後，債務多於債權（或資產），則其子（即繼承人）可以援限制承繼條款，魷所有資產償還。事實上即等於宣吿被繼承人之破產。放債之人自應留意債務人之淸償力量，否則自冒危險，自己吃虧。</p>

<h3>行荘開辦銀元存款　將俟劉財長返滬後決定　銀錢業認為在技術上仍須考慮</h3>
<p>〔中經社訊〕關於金融業向財政部建議舉辦「黃金存款」「銀元存款」及「物價指數存款」等，財政部已考慮接受。昨據記者獲悉，其中「銀元存款」一項，刻已由財政部錢幣司奉令擬定一「金圓券折合銀元存款謝謝款辦法」，在財政部秘書處審核中。其辦法之內容，規定人民可以金圓券折合當時之市價存入銀行，而在日後取出時銀行則按當時之市價付予銀元。放款則全部按金圓券折合銀元，而以金圓券計算。該辦法俟財長劉攻蕓由京返滬後，卽可作最後決定，最短期內，可望公佈實施云。</p>
<p>〔中經社訊〕財政部長兼中央銀行總裁劉攻蕓，在京已公畢，定今日由京返滬云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政當局擬發動各行荘舉辦銀元存款之訊，甚囂塵上。記者昨曾向各關係方面徵詢舉辦之可能性，反應並不良佳。茲姑按二種存款方式分析之。（一）存取均為金圓券，卽存入時之金圓卷，按當時比率折成銀圓登帳。而提取時則照當時比率再折成金圓券取出。該項辦法，在銀錢業方面認為在業務上徒增許多不必要之麻煩，銀元漲跌不定，銀錢業實感窮於應付。除非中央銀行能接受銀元之再存款，銀錢業亦難於接受該項存款。在客戶之立塲言，該項存款與過去之黃金存款不無相似之處，為免陷覆轍，故卽使開辦，恐存款不多。（二）存取鈞為銀元，銀錢業雖無折算之麻煩，惟收入銀元存款後，銀錢業無法以銀元放款，蓋恐無人願意接受銀元之貸款。吸引資金旣無法放出，銀錢業當不願接受該項新業務。故一觀測，如財政當局對銀元存款無足資鼓勵之辦法，恐難獲得熱烈之支持云。</p>
<h3>金市開盤漲停　午後步步下挫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲趨勢靡定，猛晉疾退。晨間因央行仍無拋出，利多消息四佈，人心繼續看好，開盤交易，竟無法做開，喊高至八二萬八千漲停，有求無供，迄午收仍無正式交易。午後因暗息昂達一元左右，在銀根緊俏下，人心虛軟，散戶紛紛出籠，開盤八三萬三千。中途在銀行幫金號幫賣氣籠罩下，市勢一路下落，步退至八〇萬收盤。同業劃賬價格，上午未掛，下午掛八萬六千，較假前再漲四萬七千。二天合息，僅六五元光景，實明升暗跌。</p>

<p>美鈔</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美鈔交易不多，洋行幫銀行幫進出尚旺，晨開一萬七，一萬七千五，高至一萬八，一萬八千五。午收低至一萬六千七，一萬七千二。午後開盤一萬六千五，一萬七，收盤低至一萬六千一，一萬六千四，較假前回降九百。隔日加息一千三，做高至一萬七千四，一萬七千七。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀樓飾金，門銷旺盛，價格堅挺，上午掛高至八三萬。九〇萬，下午又升至八四萬，九二萬，進出價格又放長一萬，相差達八萬，較假前再加三萬。飾銀亦漲五百，掛高至八千五進，一萬出。錢兌業，烚赤上午掛八五萬，八八萬，下午低至八三萬，八六萬。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元市況堅挺，因銀元套匯交易，本市若干貿易商行，均已普遍晨開。昨日一天套出約在一八〇萬枚左右，進出繁忙。電話對敲交易，當日支票，大頭做高達一萬四，一萬五，較現鈔交易無形之中高出一成七，馬路交易，因今日月底，各業紛將發薪，去化活躍，執貨者扳持頗力，晨喊大頭一萬〇五，一萬〇八，一路高至一萬二，一萬三。午後一度低至一萬一千五，一萬二千五，傍晚又逗滯於一萬二，一萬三之間。小頭喊一萬，一萬一，鷹龍洋喊八千，九千，較假前再漲一成半左右。</p>
<h3>塲內展開軋多　華股被迫低降</h3>
<p>華股市況，昨日走勢初尚堅定，後因大戶感於銀根走勢轉緊，紡建大量拋紗，央行暗中拋金，花紗幫證券幫，金業幫一致套售，塲上展開軋多，賣風旺盛，市勢被迫回降。永紗晨開九元九角半，開後聞黃金漲停，人心頗俏，抬面起而哄托，一路高至十元〇九角。嗣後各幫力售，低見十元〇五角五，浮空起補，又升至十元〇七八角，近午因銀根抽緊，空勢旺盛，賣風層層壓迫，以十元〇五分低價午收。</p>
<p>中小型股晨開均高，臨收因永紗軋小，各股均被帶小。美亞開後重見三元三四，曾兩次漲停，新光開轉收平，景福定走勢相同，信和勤興景綸高後均回，獨內衣漲停。振華跌停外，其餘微升。</p>
<p>午後銀根突緊，暗息高一元，一元二角，圈外黃金報跌，多頭不勝重負，市勢再告疲軟。永紗初開十元〇二角半，一路小至九元七角五分，嗣後步步低游，最小至九元一五，臨收略見回升，以九元二五收盤。其餘均較前市午收軋小。成交五〇億〇九千〇廿萬股。</p>
<p>洋股市況，昨日銀根轉緊，人心見疲，浮散戶帬起了售，市勢卽告回挫。怡紗做二四〇〇〇元，二五〇〇〇元，挫落一〇〇〇元。英聯二七〇〇〇元，三〇〇〇〇元，勁跌四〇〇〇元。怡啤做四八五〇元，五一五〇元，小三〇〇元。會德豐八五〇〇〇元，八六〇〇〇元，疲落五〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>黃金公債晨開喊五一五〇〇〇元，一路升至五五萬，嗣因銀根轉緊，黃金高後略回，市勢跟軟，午收仍為五一萬，午後無做開。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆·產價升　食米一致上挺　麵粉初堅後疲食油微秀</h3>
<p>食米價格昨日再見上漲，因銀根鬆，及產地價漲，中途再以金價報升，故上漲頗勁。北市塲白粳，薄稻普升三千元，特粳八萬九千元，已迫近九萬關。南米市，門售白粳重叩九萬元大關，二市到貨五二七一石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>漲風稍趨緩和，因連日上漲過度，貨主乘高價求售，廠方亦有開出，供應增加，價欲漲乏力，豆油最高五十四萬，收市五十二萬，微秀萬元。生菜油略昂二萬，生油獨挫二萬元，江北吉桶生油五十八萬，豆餅價平定。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>初堅後疲，開市以圈外各物激升，銀根尚稱平穩，貨主報甚力。后船初開一度高做三萬三千元，後市銀根轉緊，股市疾退，永紗跌進十關，人心虛軟，市勢步步下游，以三萬二千二百五十元最後成交。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>後市在頭寸緊俏下，多見疲落，黃豆挫落三五千元不等，車豆做作萬五千元，生仁囤戶出籠，市勢供過於求，價格略疲，苞米，紅糧收市較早，市勢略見上揚。</p>
<h3>南北通匯業務　昨起暫時停止</h3>
<p>據新華銀行消息，各指定辦理南北通匯之銀行，自昨日起，暫時停匯北方匯款。因南北通匯，自開放後，由南方匯往北方之匯款極多，而由北方匯來南方之匯款極多，而由北方匯來南方之匯款則較少。各該指定通匯銀行本身之頭寸無法平衡，不得不暫時停匯。俟北方匯來之匯款多後，南北卽可照常辦理云。</p>
<h3>中央銀行　將發六種大票</h3>
<p>〔商品調查所訊〕中央銀行，將於下月四日起，公佈發行下列數種鈔券，卽五千·一萬·五萬·十萬·五十萬·及一百萬元券六種。此項措施，當可解除各地鈔荒。又訊：本所記者頃以何日鈔荒可除，叩詢此間央行某權威，據渠告稱，下月五日，一定解除。</p>
<h3>銀根由鬆轉緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根，已由鬆轉緊。晨開日拆尚在六七十元間，旋以月底在卽，各界不乏扒吸頭寸者，日拆漸高，復聞國行大量拋金，又傳某銀行因鉅額拋空有不穩之訊，午後銀根驟緊，日拆一度破出一百元關外。最後在八九十元光景，惟缺單者仍多羅掘彌補，趨勢頗緊。</p>
<p>又昨日現鈔緊勢，以方値假後，仍未見好轉，貼現率多高至一成以上，票據盛行，票據交換所延至入晚八時許，方告交換竣事，交換張數在九十一萬張以上，金額則達四千一百餘億元之鉅。行局昨日差出七億，洋商銀行差進廿三億，大交換差進四十九億，小交換差出六十五億。</p>
<h3>行荘提現限額　國行昨已放寬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行對銀錢同業之提現限額，昨日業已寬放為照隔日存款餘額提取百分之十八，其中二成搭發國行本票，八成發給現鈔。惟結果本票因簽章關係，搭發之數尚不足二成。昨日寬放限額結果，本票約發出三億五千萬元，現鈔約五十八億元（內行荘約佔三十三億六千餘萬元）。</p>
<h3>棉紗漲跌互見　布市再創新高</h3>
<p>棉紗以週一暴漲過厲，兼之銀根轉俏，人心居高思危，各紗始高繼軟，結果較假前漲多跌少。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳初以太百三十五萬元開出，迄收因直銷關係，買戶皆抱觀望，漲勢終告不繼，乃退至六百萬元收市，軋升二十二萬元。四〇支藍鳳微升五萬元，三二支銀月由四百二十五萬元，一路盤跌至三百九十七萬元結束，終挺七萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨由三百二十九萬開出後，旋聞黃金與證券漲限，價乃哄抬至三百三十二萬元，近午市上銀根步緊，人心轉虛，最後站住三百萬關，軋降五萬元。二〇支雙馬初做三百十五萬元，甫跌入關內，步退至二百八十二萬元收市，亦挫五萬元。其他各檔互有參差，一六支以下則均告微秀。</p>
<p>布市賡高翔，晨初聞黃金漲停，人心振作，本客相繼扒吸，執散戶紛紛拉抬，在買氣籠罩之下，各布再創新高。</p>
<p>龍頭細布由十二萬二千元開出後，甫晉至十三萬九千元，迄收浮多獲利吐售眾多，價乃回落至十三萬二千五百元結束，較假前猛升二萬〇百元。五福細布亦暴漲二萬一千元，此外低檔細布均在十萬關外做開。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰始做十萬零八千元，一度叩十二萬關，收前復鬆落至十萬零六千五百元，終為十一萬六千五百元，軋挺九千三百元，收後曾做小至十萬零三千五百元。一九〇高檔士林廠盤開二十七萬元，餘布一致上揚，該市塲方面正老虎開做後市，如進行順利，下月初或可實行。</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>— 看客臺</p>
<p>不要小看銀元的買賣　有人向職工身上括血</p>
<p>職工階級，安排薪資的辦法，就是買銀元。他們只是保幣値，維生活，不是謀利。</p>
<p>薪資在月中月底發，已成慣例。所以每月一日十六日起的一週間，慣例晨開銀元的漲風。</p>
<p>有人便在職工們身上括血了！</p>
<p>他們在月中前一週，月底前一週內，陸續趁未漲買進銀元，到月中後月底後一週間，陸續趁高賣出銀元。</p>
<p>他們賣出了銀元，便去放一個星期的拆息，又到月中前月底前的一週了。於是收回拆息，再去陸續買進銀元，等到月中後月底後一週內，再賣出銀元放拆息。</p>
<p>如此周而復始，他們就靠着職工們的血，養胖了。</p>
<p>這是何等的殘忍！然而現在的所謂生意經，本來就是「人吃人」的，也不能單單怪他們。</p>
<p>到處鬧着現鈔荒，而且又是愈鬧愈荒愈嚴重。</p>
<p>但是四川路河南路，以及全市各處銀元販子手裏，一疊疊的蔟新現鈔，天天增加，無從短缺現象。</p>
<p>他們的現鈔新鈔那裏來的呢？大家奇怪着。</p>
<p>香港報上，「上海通信」有如下的記載：着制服的人，驅散路上行人，把幾麻袋新鈔，交給四川路上某小錢號，收了大批銀元去。接着，就有十幾個銀元販領袖，從這個小錢號領到大批現鈔，分別在街頭分散給銀元販，再從銀元販收回銀元去。</p>
<p>銀元販銀元市塲的現鈔什麼地方來的？喏，就是這個樣子來的。</p>
<p>信不信由你。</p>
<p>央行非特不想法消滅票據的貼水，新近發行定額本票等行為，反在擴大票據的貼水風潮。</p>
<p>近二天來現鈔之緊，緊勢愈趨愈烈，因而貼水風潮，也愈趨愈烈。</p>
<p>在前述港報的「上海通信」裏，卻又報告着下面那樣的事：</p>
<p>着制服的朋友，提了裝滿新現鈔的麻袋，在四川路等某種小錢荘裏，買進銀元，也買進本票和支票。據說：他們收進票據是照九折付現。就是說：一萬元票據，付出九千元新現鈔收進。這樣可以曉得，銀元販子收進一萬元票據時，實在只賺一千元貼水，還有一千元貼水，是替制服朋友代收的。</p>
<p>現在做着票據貼水生意的，不限於銀元市塲。還有許多地下錢荘，乃至若干公開行荘的職員們，也都參加着。</p>
<p>這些做着票據貼水生意的機關及人物，奇怪的，他們都能付出一大疊一大疊的，五百一千元票面的新鈔票。任何大的票據貼水，他們都能吃得落，貼得出。</p>
<p>他們的這些新現鈔，又從何而來呢？</p>
<p>除了發鈔機關之外，沒有誰能如此有辦法地充分供應新現鈔的。</p>
<p>我們當然不能認定：央行拒發現鈔給商民，而要留着供給收買銀元之用。</p>
<p>我們當然也不能認為：央行拒絕對商民發給新現鈔，是為了要在地下錢荘市塲上，去賺一千元的貼水。</p>
<p>然而我們也不能確認：銀元市塲及票據貼現市塲上，這些新現鈔，不是央行直接供應的。</p>
<p>我們只曉得凡是現鈔，都是央行發出。凡是新現鈔，只有央行才能供應。</p>
<p>新財長劉攻蕓，央行新總裁，仍是劉攻蕓兼任。劉氏是個理財能手，得中樞倚重，我們希望他拿出手腕來，澈底追究迅速消滅現鈔荒，消滅貼水罪惡！</p>
<p>大梱新鈔惡市出現　望劉財長澈底追究</p>
<p>市價一覽</p>

<h3>女籃球圈</h3>
<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>論擁有好班底的星華隊</p>
<p>要是以星華隊的人頭，而如以下支配一個陣容：</p>
<p>前鋒　張秀麗　汪澤綸　王慧玲　王珊　錢夢月</p>
<p>後衛　朱蘭貞　黃如玉　王珊　朱家珍　吳兆瑞</p>
<p>凡是準球迷一看以上的陣線，當然——大家很會想到她們的成績，不是可以穩取黎隊，進而威脅綠隊的。卽以中學盃中民立亦屬能擊退啓秀，星華有民立的將士外復有王珊吳兆瑞張秀麗王慧玲等市代表。應比民立勝，而黎隊則是啓秀的班底，以此而衡，星華似乎本屆聯賽不應該如此不爭氣，前夕羅約翰僅一隻半，雖說是約翰的努力，而一方面也足徵星華的每況愈下。</p>
<p>每一件事的好壞，自然決不是沒有因素，則星華有如此好的人材而成績未臻理想者，在筆者的觀察，應有下列兩個毛病。</p>
<p>（一）管理不得其法——這話或許有許多人不會相信，凡圈內人多知道星華隊幕後管理人是我們的老友邱紅康君，對外的管理而負全責者則是籃委會的總幹事瞿錫榮君，邱兄前是前線女子隊的管理，經騐豐富，且有敏感的頭腦，而瞿君乃是當局人物，更足珍貴。那末，何以說管理不得其法，紅康兄近來忙於他事不大顧及，瞿君有一身是豪氣的能耐，卻缺少細膩的理想，因此有過與不及的弊病，所謂過者，對球員的球藝估計太高，所謂不及者，不能促她們做實質的訓練。所以在管理方面，以後要是邱瞿通力合作一個智一個勇的混合努力起來，市長盃中還是可以有殷望的。</p>
<p>（二）缺少練習機會——星華本屆的演出，完全是陷入明星型偶象制的單獨表演，有好人材而沒有好演出，便基於此，那我的批評，一定是缺乏一起練習的機會，於是在最近的戰術中，祗有個人技術，沒有隊的合作，沒有方法進攻，沒有全作防衛，自然祗能屈居下風，未能發揮其個人的優點，這是很可惜的。</p>
<p>星華本屆有了這個毛病，因此鬱鬱不得志，如能改進，應有厚望，譬如她們隊中的隊員，每一個人具有特殊的優點，試看：</p>
<p>王慧玲——有高度，有速度，活潑能射，好中鋒也。唯本屆以學業繁重未出塲，亦星華之大缺憾也。</p>
<p>張秀麗——能竄有勁，勇敢絕倫，邊角射籃甚佳，惜久疏於此，不免減色。</p>
<p>錢夢月——射籃有怪手作風，看也隨手一挪，卻十有九中，一前夕奇材，惟患短視，稍形吃虧。</p>
<p>汪澤綸——劫截功夫，不讓鬚眉，殺辣有餘，射籃未見爐火純青耳。</p>
<p>王珊——身段修長，輕盈善跳，能鋒能衛，善作跟進工作，女籃全材。</p>
<p>黃如玉——看人奇緊，地位亦佳，攔阻亦有門檻，　身材較矮，易於犯規。</p>
<p>朱家珍——體格健美，高度超人，獲球當較便利，任守衛似能勝人一級，動作稍較遲慢。</p>
<p>朱蘭占——釘人之逼緊，當者披靡，易犯規為缺點。</p>
<p>吳兆瑞——頭腦清淅，搶球阻人有路，避人運球亦佳。</p>
<p>在此——我更想列的是星華的幾位，都是很有良好運動精神的，那末，本屆與綠隊之役，無故棄權，實是令人遺憾，希望能力自改革。不識市長盃中該隊參加否？如參加的話，則三復我言而努力，我想一定會有驚人的戰績，良好的演出，以　球迷。</p>
<h3>仁餘如勝海青　亞軍地位可保　籃球聯賽甲一組已成尾聲</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽今日原有甲級三塲，惟壓軸甲一組第二循環華聯滬警因故改期，僅剩兩仗，下午五時半起，在市體育館交鋒，門券樓上五百，樓下一千，塲內對號一千五百元，秩序及比賽時間先錄如次：</p>
<p>平平——胖隊（甲二C）五時半</p>
<p>仁餘——海青（甲一補）六時半</p>
<p>首仗甲二C組平平與胖隊對壘，兩隊實力伯仲，球藝均在水準線上，胖隊麾下，劉本董仰峯張不卿等沙塲老將，經騐豐富，惟於長力方面似嫌不夠。平平雖新興之旅，但在該組中曾壓倒塔爾，鬥力可知，夏智昂饒餘榕年少氣足，王微君射籃尤具妙手，與胖隊堪稱旗鼓相當，屆時角逐，當有可觀。</p>
<p>次幕甲一組仁餘再戰海青，按此戰係第一循環之補賽，仁餘在本屆中戰績，僅次於華聯，雖有滬警緊隨於後，但該隊除今晚之戰外僅剩對滬警一塲，今晚倘獲勝海青，對於亞軍一席卽可高枕無憂，在此緊要關頭，自必全力登塲，該隊近況殊佳，勝利希望濃厚，海青今晚仍由卻爾敦艦替代作戰，按卻爾敦上週為海青與麥令斯作聯賽二循鬥，二〇比四一敗退，蓋地板燈光不熟，不無關係，今晚二度庖代，想有較好演出。四隊人馬錄下：</p>
<p>（平平）王微君，夏智昂，汪耀祥，陳榮林，宋連庠，孫學文，趙歇銘，李永吉，饒餘榕。</p>
<p>（胖隊）孫銘新，劉本勤，董仰峯，何孝光，陳北庭，張少卿，宋啓候，季有昆，凌鵬。</p>
<p>（仁餘）吳新運，姚文彝，荘逸榮，沈鵬舉，李肇和，王槐庭，蔡金典，孫國政，徐仲已，晏彬。</p>
<p>（海青）賽潑拉，勃朗，皮維區，蘇培，哈勃脫，亞魯，史密斯，賽姆，史班恩，湯穆斯，達脫曼。</p>
<p>甲一組戰程已入決定階段，八隊之中回力麥令斯及培斐爾三隊已完全結束，戰績方面華聯先後十二戰僅敗一次，錦標已在握。其次仁餘八勝四負，今晚倘勝海青，亞軍亦無問題。滬警六勝五負，尚有三仗，茍獲全勝，則可與仁餘同分，並列亞座，至第三席則變化較多。茲將甲一組最近形勢列表如后：</p>
<p>隊名　賽　勝　負　百分率</p>
<p>華聯　十二　十一　一　九〇一</p>
<p>仁餘　十二　八　四　六六六</p>
<p>回力　十四　八　六　五七一</p>
<p>滬警　十一　六　五　五四五</p>
<p>恩卡斯　十二　六　六　五〇〇</p>
<p>麥令斯　十四　五　九　三五七</p>
<p>培斐爾　十四　四　十　二八五</p>
<p>海青青　十一　三　八　二七二</p>

<h3>磐隊勝華光一球　民主盃賽明日龍頭戰大夏</h3>
<p>磐隊與華光昨在南市舉行民主盃賽，華光因吳祺祥缺席，影響實力，然仍始終採取攻勢，惜射門欠準，未有收獲。在上半時將終反被磐隊司徒原打中一球，卽此決定勝負。磐隊奮鬥精神甚佳，能以一對零壓倒華光，亦非十分意外。</p>
<p>明日下午四時龍頭將與中級組冠軍大夏相逢，裁判員馬友於，巡邊員瞿如松，臧文彬，昨日磐隊與華光之出塲陣容如下：</p>
<p>磐隊</p>

<h3>乒乓須知</h3>
<p>— 王心景著　陳霖笙校　（二）</p>
<p>（四）她對我們有些什麼好處</p>
<p>可以鍜鍊身體「健全的事業，寓於健全的身體。」「留得青山在，不怕沒柴燒。」我們不曾看見過一個病會會幹一番為人所不能為的事業，你有極大的極好的志願，而你的身體是禁不得西風的一吹，忍不住烈日的一晒，那麼我為了你的將來或許有為，或許不同凡眾，而格外惦記着。身體的健康與我們未來的命運，我不想多談，但我們可以肯定的說：「神職——不論大小都是神職的事業，要有健全的身體的人才配去幹。」我們想在「生到死」這一段時間裏不碌碌的虛度，就感到鍜鍊身體的重要。</p>
<p>人力車夫特別發達的是兩條腿，鐵匠特別發達的是兩隻手，思想家特有的是一個組織比一般人格外複雜的腦袋……運用愈多，就愈加發達。有的運動每使身體畸形的發展，而乒乓卻是全身平均的運動。不但全身運動平均，同樣還需要「轉念頭」，所以也是手腦並用的運動。</p>
<p>我決不是說鍜鍊身體的只有乒乓運動，但我卻敢說乒乓運動可以鍜鍊身體，我們知道少林拳可以鍜鍊身體，太極拳也一樣可以鍜鍊身體，參燕銀耳據說可以滋補身體，但我們相信青菜淡飯更於身體有益。乒乓是溫和的運動，可以比之國技中的太極拳，可以比之飲食中的青菜淡飯。「有些人是百歲之童，有些人是三歲之翁，」試試看我們大家都來做「百歲之童」。</p>
<p>上面已經把乒乓的環境不論時，地，人約略的說了幾句。在這裏要談談她對我們有些什麼好處？我覺得她對我們有顯而易見的幾點：</p>
<p>培養高尚品性　我們在極忙的當兒，要抽些時間休息休息；在空閒的當中，常常想找些事情做做，這是一般人的心理。空閒的時候，我們可以做好的事情，也可以做不好的事情。但以常情而論，「鶴立雞帬」的「鶴」，畢竟是少數，大多是「隨波逐流」的「雞」。所以我們只聽到雀戰的「霹拍」聲，只聽到喝酒猜拳，只聽見談奸淫盜賊，不大聽見研究正當問題，……從這些「司空見慣」的事情中看來，可見大多數人是不會利用閒暇，沒有正當的娛樂。這是多麼危險的一回事！</p>
<p>「學壞易，改好難」，我們應在未學壞以前不學壞；在不學壞的當中去「習上」。倘使一有空就去拍乒乓，就易與大部分的惡習隔離，保持我們原有的天真。為了乒乓運動的高尚，養成我們優良的品性。拍球的習慣養成了，在身體不舒暢的時候一執球拍，就像酒友浮一大白，樂乃無窮。其足以娛樂身心，那是題裏文章了。</p>
<p>增加辦事效率　以同一程度的人，在同樣的環境裏，處理同樣的事情，一定會得到不同的成績。這是為了興趣的關係。興趣好，他的思想自然會精密，手腕自然會敏捷。在做了得意事情之後，興趣好的多，而外界事物之足以引起我們注意的，往往也能發生興趣。興趣的好不好，我們可以說由於內心者十之七，由於外感者十之三。</p>

<h3>管閒事記</h3>
<p>— 仲</p>
<p>我常常愛管人家的閒事，許多久經世故的長者，都認爲這是不應該的。不過有一件事，在我愛管閒事的人看來，是做得頗爲〔稱心如意」的。</p>
<p>上月，我瞧見一個高等的乞丐，用最新科學的方怯討錢。我先讓你知道這人的外形：瘦瘦的臉，長短適中的身體，平頭，臉上沒有難看的鬚鬚，很淸潔，身上穿着灰白的布長衫，腳上還穿了一雙微亮的黃皮鞋。他將身體坐在一條綫毯上，長衫撩起，露出了半段用布裏着的左腿，折在右腿底下。右腿是伸直的，使別人看見了他右腿是健全的，左腿却有了毛病，不能走動。他的胸前睡着一個嬰兒，另外還有一個兩三歲，走路還不大穩的小孩，立在他的左旁。這孩子的頭髮刷過生髮油，梳的是西式，但是肢體弱得十分可憐。四周看熱鬧的人很多，這位高尙乞丐自言自語地說：「腿瘋癱了，事情也不能做，孩子的媽也病着：「意思是說他是失業的人，但他原來有能力做事，祇因一條腿成了殘廢，以致影響了他的前程。妻子病着，自然這也是間接受到失業的影饗。加上孩子又無人照應，他祇得厚着臉來乞討了。這種苦痛還不够引人的同情嗎？</p>
<p>要是果眞是　三，也無人肯來顧問了。然而像他這種人，家境本來不錯的，你瞧他的服裝和孩子的打扮就知道了，一且流落到這種地步確是凄凉，因此旁觀者就願意拿錢給他。他身上齣一件布長衫，至少也値兩三萬，所以旁觀者決不會拿拾元，五十元給他的，你想，可好意思拿得出手麼？</p>
<p>他手裏握有很多的金圓券，把屁股朝前移。每移兩三步，魷將站的孩子朝前拖。那孩子的心究竟是純潔的，便張着嘴英了，哭得很姜慘，甚至於還會跳腳，似乎不勝吃力的樣子。我跟着他們走了不少路，到了人少的地方，祗見那位高尙的乞丐跨上了黃包車，帶着兩個孩子，不知到那兒去了。</p>
<p>第二次我發現這人在大世界附近，他的兩腿直立，面前放着一副担子，兩頭的篾籃裏，一邊坐一個將死的小孩，又有不少的人在給他錢。</p>
<p>第三次我瞧見他從黃包車上下來，帶着兩個孩子，仍和我第一次瞧見的時侯一樣的表演。可憐他的遭遇的人，又在賞賜給他。</p>
<p>我是極希望看見別人肯施濟窮人的，可是，不知怎麼樣，對于這位乞丐先生却生了厭煩之心。我簡直有點恨他道種舉動，我相信我決不是看見他抓着大捲鈔票因而眼紅。我之所以恨他，乃是因爲我看出了他的破綻。他不該騙人，尤其是不該借孩子來騙人。那孩子我想決不是他的骨肉，由於我幾次所瞧見的孩子面貌都不同，他不會生有這麼多；而且有的年齡似乎相差不過幾個月的。再說，他對孩子的神情，亳無痛恤齣成份表現出來。一個無從消失的問題在我腦中盤旋：這些孩子是從那兒弄來的？是不是拖死了就隨便的把他們扔棄了。因此，第三次我見到他的時節，我把我的疑慮向一位巡警訴說了。巡警也覺得很奇怪，說：「前一刻鐘我碰見他還在××路，怎麼一會兒又跑到這兒來了？「接着，巡警便上前去盤問他，他顯然是有些驚慌。大約是話說得有不順當的地方，巡警帶着怒氣在他背後踢了好幾腳，無論如何要他站起。他先仍說自已是瘋癱，情願忍着痛。後來皮鞋重量終於治愈了他的病症，他居然可以起立了，而且能跟巡警一同到「行里去」。</p>
<p>以後的事我不淸楚。可是從此我沒有再遇見這位高尙的乞丐却是眞的。我希望這借無知的孩童來騙取財物的流氓，的確是受到了他應得的懲罰。</p>

<p>偶然看見一張香港角票，牠一面印着文字，一面却是全部空白的。</p>
<p>我國的財政，現在收支相較，總是入不敷出，於是用通貨膨脹來彌補，鈔票也就源源不絕地流通在市面上了。</p>
<p>現在我建議央行當局，以後發行的鈔票，不妨仿照香港票的式樣，祇印一面，留着空白的一面，可以招登廣吿。因爲鈔票的流通地域很大，而且又是人人所必需的，所以牠的効力一定也是很大的。登廣吿的公司商店，決計不會吃虧，而央行也可以有一筆不小的進帳，不知央行當局以爲何如？</p>

<p>按理，一個即將臨盆分娩的孕婦，應當享受較好的待過和謹愼的照顧。但是在世界的某些地域，却反其道而行，被侍侯的竟是將做爸爸但並無分娩之苦的男子。</p>
<p>例如，在波羅的海某些地方，在一個即將添丁的家庭中，吃藥進補的是丈夫，而大腹便便的妻子，則完全被置之不顧。嬰兒從母體墮地之後，臨床而撫育之者，也是丈夫而不是妻子，這種風俗呌做「男子育兒」。</p>
<p>在英屬圭亞那，印地安女子一直要操勞到分娩前數小時，而她的丈夫，則在添丁之前好幾天就可躺在床上安息休養了。他吃得特別營養，以便保證他太太會生下一個健康的嬰兒。當孕婦要生產時，她魷隱入樹林之中，而其時，她的丈夫則躺在床上無病呻吟，好像眞要臨盆一樣。產婦一待胎兒墮地，便立即趕回家來，照管她齣嬰兒，她自己，還有她的丈夫，——直到他完全從生產「康復」爲止。</p>

<h3>Listening to the Peace Talk Report at the Legislative Yuan, Encouraging Representatives to Fulfill Their Mission, Shao Lizi Not Discouraged, Zhang Zhizhong Filled with Emotion, President Chiang States He Will Not Intervene in Politics</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Chief Representative of the Government's Peace Delegation, Zhang Zhizhong, flew back to Nanjing from Xikou around 3 p.m. on the 30th. After a short rest, he immediately went to the Legislative Yuan to attend a closed-door meeting to report on his visit with President Chiang. At 8 p.m., the representatives gathered at Zhang's private residence to discuss relevant matters, with personnel from the secretariat also participating. Zhang also reported on his trip to Xikou, and the meeting adjourned at 11 p.m. Zhang then accompanied Huang Shaohong to visit Acting President Li, reporting on the Xikou trip, not returning until midnight.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] President Chiang has decided to adopt a completely non-interfering attitude towards the major peace plan, allowing Acting President Li and Premier He to decide and handle matters with full authority. President Chiang also stated that he is determined, as a private citizen, to fully support Acting President Li in achieving peace. President Chiang made this statement on the 29th when he met with Zhang Zhizhong, who was representing the Kuomintang and reporting to the President in Xikou on the peace talks. Zhang Zhizhong, after returning to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 30th, went to the Legislative Yuan to attend a closed-door meeting, reporting on his visit to Xikou. Zhang said: President Chiang in Xikou was touring the mountains and rivers, appearing relaxed and at ease. He stated that since he had already retired, he would not interfere in politics. In the past, he first advocated for peace, and now he sincerely hopes that everyone will work hard to complete it. When the President and Zhang went for a walk, facing the stream in front of the mountain, he happily told Zhang: "I haven't lived in my hometown for so long in over forty years. If the peace talks can succeed, the world can be at peace, and the people can live and work in peace, it would be like being an immortal to spend my remaining years in my hometown." His attitude was very relaxed and cheerful when he said this. Zhang also told the legislators that President Chiang has gained weight since his retirement, going from 118 pounds to 125 pounds. After learning of President Chiang's statement, the legislators expressed their infinite joy with enthusiastic applause. The closed-door meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 30th was held at 3 p.m. All six government peace representatives were invited to attend. Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi each gave reports. Shao stated that while many outside believe he is pessimistic about the peace talks, he is not discouraged. The Chinese Communists insist on eight conditions, and the government's measures to benefit the peace talks have not been thoroughly implemented in the past two months, so the future of the peace talks is indeed difficult. However, he agreed to be a peace representative, which indicates that he is not discouraged. After Shao's report, more than ten legislators, including Hou Shaowen, Zhang Qianhua, Jiang Yiping, Hu Daoyuan, Huang Jianzhong, Yang Gongda, Yang Buping, Wu Chouren, Zhong Pusheng, and Cui Xueli, spoke one after another. Summarizing their opinions, in addition to encouraging the peace representatives to complete their mission, they also put forward the following hopes: (1) Both sides should first cease fire, (2) Maintain the people's freedom of life, (3) The people's standpoint should be the standpoint, and it should not only be the government's standpoint. (4) Concessions should be made. (5) Nationalization of the army, etc. (6) Peace should be fair and reasonable. After the legislators finished speaking, Zhang Zhizhong reported. Zhang first stated that the peace representatives were appointed by the government and should be guided and restrained by the government, but the government is also responding to the people's demands and striving for peace, and will accept the supervision and guidance of the Legislative Yuan at any time. The delegation will not abandon the common aspirations of the people and will do its best for the country and the nation. Zhang expressed that he could not bear to look back on the evolution of the peace talks over the past two years and the changing situation, and was filled with emotion. It is said that he participated in peace talks with the Chinese Communists two years ago, but his mood for going to Beiping for peace talks today is very different. Regarding the preparations for the peace talks, Zhang said that it is not convenient to announce anything before the negotiations. The specific counter-proposals to the Chinese Communists' eight conditions must also be kept secret. However, in abstract terms, such as the issues of the constitution and legal system, the Legislative and Supervisory Committees have collectively expressed their opinions on this, advocating that as long as peace can be achieved, no sacrifice should be spared. Since everyone has expressed this, the government should attach importance to everyone's opinions. Confiscating bureaucratic capital and reforming the land system have long been our consistent demands in the past. Even today, who would think of the wealthy, but this must have its methods. As for treasonous treaties, everyone opposes them. Abolishing treasonous treaties, I believe, will be supported by everyone, but what constitutes a treasonous treaty needs to be distinguished. These five items are not difficult. The other three items, punishing war criminals, reorganizing the army, and establishing a coalition government, are more difficult to resolve than the first five, but these difficulties are not insurmountable, and we should strive for a proper solution. Zhang's report lasted forty minutes. His attitude was relaxed and cheerful, interspersed with hearty laughter. The legislators responded with warm applause more than ten times in forty minutes. After Zhang's report, President of the Legislative Yuan, Tong Guanxian, also stood up to thank the peace representatives and wished them success in completing their mission and achieving peace. The meeting adjourned around 6 p.m. (The opinions of the Shanghai National Assembly Members Association and the National Peace Promotion Association on the peace talks are published on page two.)</p>
<h3>Secretariat Staff of the Peace Delegation, Lu Yuwen and Others Fly to Beiping Today, Representatives for Postal and Aviation Communications Fly North on the Same Plane</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] A group of seventeen people, including the secretariat staff of the peace delegation and the representatives for postal and aviation communications, are scheduled to fly to Beiping from Nanjing on the morning of the 31st at 10 a.m. on a special plane provided by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). The group will be led by Secretary-General Lu Yuwen and will include ten secretariat staff, five postal representatives, and one aviation representative. The plane will also carry several large boxes of reference materials and silver dollars for use. The delegation, its advisors, secretaries, and staff are scheduled to go to Beiping on the 1st. The list of advisors still needs to be approved at the political affairs meeting on the 31st, and will likely include Jiang Yong, Li Junlong, Jie Wu, and Mo Dehui. The government is taking a very cautious attitude towards the peace talks this time, so the preparation work is also very careful and thorough. The delegation members are also very cautious in their external communications and do not reveal any news that could affect the peace talks. In general, people have high hopes that the delegation's trip will ultimately be successful, and Zhang Zhizhong, who has always maintained confidence, is leading the entire team, which further increases the optimism of all parties regarding the peace talks. The delegation members have all expressed the spirit of "taking one step at a time, not asking about the harvest, only knowing how to cultivate," which is admirable and comforting. It is reported that the delegation's preparations are already in order, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) delegation's departure time and the number of its staff were notified on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The representatives sent by the Directorate General of Posts to negotiate comprehensive postal communications with the CCP, Mei Yifan, Weng Haoying, Li Xiong, Shen Xin, and Wang Zhenbai, as well as the representative from CNAC to negotiate aviation communications, Lei Zuoren, and the representative from the aviation industry, Jin Shan, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane at noon on the 30th and are scheduled to fly to Beiping on the special plane with the secretariat staff of the government peace delegation on the 31st. The postal representatives going to Beiping will negotiate with the CCP on the following issues: (1) location of mail exchange, (2) types of packages, (3) principles of remittance, (4) uniform postage, (5) personnel safety, and other issues.</p>
<h3>Should the Legislative Yuan Suspend Meetings During the Peace Talks? Legislators Exchange Opinions Today</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Whether the Legislative Yuan should suspend meetings during the peace talks has become a major concern for most legislators. Some legislators are brewing a proposal for discussion by the General Assembly. The fourth informal meeting of legislators, originally scheduled for 3 p.m. on the 31st, has decided to focus on this issue and exchange opinions first. If meetings should be temporarily suspended, then the existing proposals must be quickly processed so that the meeting can be adjourned immediately.</p>
<h3>Li Junlong Flies to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changsha, 30th] Li Junlong flew to Nanjing on the morning of the 30th. He stated that he was going to Beiping this time on orders to work for "the public will of the people." Li specifically denied rumors that Li Weihan and he were brothers, saying they were not "older brothers," but "school seniors." However, Li does have an older brother, Li Zhuoran, who joined the Communist Party and has not been in contact for twenty years.</p>
<h3>New Argentine Ambassador Arrives in Nanjing, Scheduled to Present Credentials Today</h3>
<p>Outgoing Ambassador Bids Farewell to Acting President Li Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] The new Argentine Ambassador to China, Rodriguez (pictured), arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 30th and is scheduled to present his credentials to Acting President Li at the Presidential Palace at 10 a.m. on the 31st. In addition, the Dominican Republic's Minister to China, Mr. Guzman, will return home to report on his duties and went to the Presidential Palace at 4 p.m. on the 30th to bid farewell to Acting President Li, who hosted him with tea and refreshments.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan and Bai Chongxi Visit Acting President Li for a Long Talk</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Yan Xishan had frequent visits on the 30th after arriving in Nanjing. He went to Chuanhougang at 9 a.m. to pay his respects to Acting President Li and had a long talk that lasted three hours, not leaving until 12 p.m. When Yan paid his respects to Acting President Li, Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Wuhan on the 29th, also paid his respects and participated in the discussion. At 2 p.m. in the afternoon, Yan visited Premier He Yingqin, at 3 p.m. he visited Bai Chongxi, and at 4 p.m. he visited Yu Youren, returning to the Capital Hotel to rest at 5 p.m. At around 6 p.m., Premier He personally visited Yan at the Capital Hotel in return, and then Xu Yongchang and others came to visit.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Smoothly Passes the He Cabinet's Policy Guidelines, Only Four Members Questioned, Remaining Members Submit Questions in Writing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Premier He Yingqin, accompanied by his cabinet members, attended the Legislative Yuan on the 30th to report on the policy guidelines. It passed the biggest difficulty since his inauguration with unexpected smoothness. As a rule, the questions posed by the legislators after the report of the policy guidelines by the newly appointed premier are extremely severe. Weng Wenhao, the first premier of the constitutional cabinet, was interrogated for three days. Sun Ke was exempted because he only made a supplementary report after announcing his resignation. However, He Yingqin only received questions from four people, and the remaining fifty or so people submitted their questions in writing, which He will answer in writing. The Legislative Yuan held the ninth meeting of the third session on the 30th. Chairman Tong Guanxian, He Yingqin, the heads of various ministries, the Chief of Staff, and the Commander of the Navy were all present on time. After the reporting of the items, the meeting began, and the premier and the heads of the ministries reported on the policy guidelines. He Yingqin calmly stepped onto the podium and read out the policy guidelines passed by the Political Council meeting on the 29th (full text on the left corner), which took twenty minutes to complete. Finally, He also modestly stated that he had always held military positions, and this time he took the post of Premier of the Executive Yuan, deciding to be pragmatic and realistic. The purpose of the above-mentioned guidelines is to achieve them, so he did not dare to make excessively high demands, hoping that the legislators would give guidance. After he finished speaking, he received a lot of applause. This was followed by a military report, in which Xu Yongchang and Gu Zhutong explained the verification of military strength, the improvement of conscription and treatment, the recent strength of both sides, the movement of the Communist army, and the situation of river defense, all of which were very concise. Gui Yongqing was also invited to attend and report on the Chongqing warship incident, saying that he had reported the facts and asked to be punished. After the break, the questioning began. Fifty-nine people requested to speak. Zhang Qingzhen spoke first, hoping for two points: (1) Abide by the spirit of the Constitution and respect the powers of the Legislative Yuan. Important decisions should be made after consulting the Legislative Yuan. (2) Guarantee personal freedom and remove obstacles to peace. (3) Truly achieve a responsible cabinet, stand up straight, and take responsibility. Gao Tingzi raised three doubts and disagreements about the policy guidelines: (1) Does the so-called transportation industry no longer (completely) rely on subsidies from the national treasury, but still needs (partially) subsidize? (2) In addition to Guan Yuan, the tax revenue has revived the (tax Yuan) unit system, with too many tricks, and the people do not know what to do. (3) The technical problems in the implementation of the property tax should not cause nationwide disturbances, and should truly make the rich people of the country pay. He also hoped that He would employ people based on their talents and that the policy guidelines could be fulfilled, and reforms must produce results. Zhou Yong urged He to pay attention to prevent opportunistic bureaucrats from mixing in, resulting in corrupt and incompetent politics. Wu Shipeng advocated: (1) Peace is for the government to represent the people in negotiating peace, and there should be minimum conditions during negotiations, which should be finalized by the Legislative Yuan. (2) Spiritual education for soldiers is important and should still be emphasized. In the economic field, speculation by banks should be cracked down on. Then, Li Xiatian's written opinion on the issue of military reorganization was read out. The legislators argued that the written opinions should be sent to Premier He for reference and did not need to be read out. By then, it was almost noon. The chairman consulted the opinions of the audience. There were still fifty-four people who had not had a chance to speak. Whether to extend the time, most legislators felt that time would never allow everyone to speak, and mainly advocated that all be changed to written form and sent to Premier He for compilation and answers. After a vote, the meeting was adjourned at 12 o'clock, and He Yingqin and his cabinet members also left the venue at the same time.</p>
<h3>More Than 3,000 Faculty and Students of Anhui University</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 30th] More than 3,000 faculty and students of Anhui University recently sent a telegram to the authorities in Central China, requesting that ships be sent to Anqing to welcome and evacuate them.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Communist Army Currently Has a Total Strength of Approximately Four Million, Will Cross the Yangtze River in Early Summer if Peace Talks Fail, Gu Zhutong Reports on Military Affairs at the Legislative Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong reported at the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 30th that the current strength of the Communist army, including the first-line troops, second-line troops, and militia, is approximately four million people. Gu said: At the end of 1947, the Communist army had a total of more than 1.9 million people. By the end of 1948, it had increased to more than 3.55 million people. This year, it has reached more than 3.95 million people. Its field army has a total of 106 columns (now changed to armies), 1.7 million people, and the military region troops have 770,000 people, totaling 2.5 million people. The second-line troops and militia total more than 1 million people. There are approximately 120,000 communist troops south of the Yangtze River, of which 1.54 million belong to Lin Biao, 780,000 to Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian, 270,000 to Peng Dehuai, 730,000 to Chen Yi, 470,000 to Liu Bocheng, and 120,000 to local communist troops, distributed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangdong and other places. There are also more than 10,000 people near the capital and Xiaguan. When Gu mentioned the issue of the Communist army crossing the Yangtze River, he said: From a purely military point of view, the deployment and preparation for crossing the river have been largely completed, so that they can put forward harsh conditions to the government during the peace talks. If the peace talks fail, they will blame the government. According to the previous deployment of the Communist army, Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi are responsible for the east of Wuhu, Chen Geng is responsible for the west of Wuhu, and Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian are on the west side of the Pinghan Railway. According to the information currently available, the Communist army may cross the Yangtze River in early summer, that is, in April or May. Regarding the National Army's defense of the Yangtze River, Gu also mentioned that the defense of the Yangtze River is the responsibility of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters and the Central China Military and Political Commander's Office. The Tang Headquarters is responsible for Pukou to Shanghai, and the Eighth Pacification Zone is responsible for above Pukou. At present, most of the ports in Jiangbei have been closed, and the National Army has deployed a tight defense in Jiangnan. Bridgehead fortifications have been set up in Jiangbei to cover the navy's patrol of the river surface, and the air force is also conducting extensive reconnaissance. This deployment and preparation, I believe, can be consolidated day by day. If the Communist army wants to cross the Yangtze River, relying only on wooden boats, when the river is rising, the wind and waves are very large, and it is not easy to cross the Yangtze River by wooden boats. The National Army will absolutely strictly guard the Yangtze River to conduct peace talks with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway, Zhumadian Falls</h3>
<p>Communist Army That Attacked Wangkongdian Was Defeated</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Huayuan, 30th] Fierce fighting broke out at Wangjiadian (118 kilometers from Hankou), 16 kilometers north of Huayuan on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, at 3 a.m. on the 30th. A part of the Communist Army's Jianghan Column, about 5,000 people, invaded the town of Wangjiadian and moved in groups to attack the railway station. The elite troops of Zhang Gan's Army Corps, which rushed to the aid of Wangjiadian, completely defeated the two regiments of the Communist Army that had infiltrated the town of Wangjiadian at 1 p.m. today and recaptured the high ground on the north side of the railway station.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xinyang, 30th] A regiment of the New First Brigade of the Communist Army and more than 1,000 local communist troops from Suiping and Biyang sneaked into Zhumadian at 10 a.m. this morning. A certain regiment of the Third Security Brigade stationed there retreated to Queshan at 9 a.m. this morning, holding firm and awaiting reinforcements.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Accident at Ningxia Airport</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 30th] An Air Force C-47 transport plane, number 255, flew from Lanzhou to Ningxia this morning to transport banknotes for the national treasury. At 4:30 p.m. in the afternoon, it took off from Ningxia carrying 27 passengers to fly to Lanzhou. During takeoff, it caught fire due to mechanical failure.

<h3>Acting President Li Holds a Tea Party Today to Entertain Members of the Central Political Committee and Central Standing Committee, Leaders of the Democratic Socialist Party and Youth Party, Zhang Junmai and Li Huang, Arrive in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 30th] Acting President Li is scheduled to hold a tea party at 4 p.m. on the 31st to entertain members of the Central Political Committee and Central Standing Committee in Nanjing, and invite peace representatives to attend to exchange opinions.</p>

<h3>The Battle of Anqing Reaches Its Climax, Communist Army Reinforcements Are Repelled Despite Repeated Attacks</h3>
<p>Several River Boats Were Shot at by the Communist Army While Passing Through Huayangzhen</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Wuhu, 30th] The battle of Anqing has entered its eighth day, and the war has also reached its climax. The three armies of the Communist Army's Chen Geng Department, after repeated reinforcements, launched another full-scale attack on the suburbs of the city on the night of the 29th. Among them, the attacks in the agricultural school and Qipanshan areas in the northeast of the city were particularly fierce. After the arrival of reinforcements from the sea and land routes, the National Army also fought back bravely. After a fierce battle until the morning of the 30th, a large formation of the National Air Force rushed to join the battle, and the Communist Army finally retreated after suffering more than 3,000 casualties. As of the evening of the 30th, the National Army still secured the original positions of Wulidun, Fenghuangshan, Qipanshan, and other places. The so-called abandonment of the airfield is obviously a misreport. In addition: The offensive of the Communist Army on the sandbars of Shangguan and Tiexin in the middle of the Yangtze River west of Anqing has been frustrated since the 30th under the fierce fire net formed by the joint land and sea forces of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Wuhu, 30th] External communications in Anqing are unhindered today, and the rumor of being interrupted is inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 30th] Military information: The battle of Anqing has entered a decisive stage. Part of the defending army of the city has moved to the suburbs to prepare to encircle and attack the Communist Army. According to transportation sources here: After Anqing became tense, the Jiangtai ship that went there to pick up non-combatants and the Jiangshun ship that was preparing to sail to Shanghai both departed from Anqing yesterday afternoon and sailed west from Qishou, and when they arrived at Huayangzhen north of Wangjiang, they were suddenly shot at by the Communist Army on the shore. A total of two people were killed and one injured on the Jiangshun ship, and there were no losses on the Jiangtai ship. In addition, eight people were killed and one injured on a certain ship of the Dada Company. The details are being investigated.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 30th] Aviation industry news: Yangtze River shipping has not been completely blocked. The Minzu ship left Yichang for Shanghai today. Also, the Minsheng Company's No. 1 oil tanker left Nanjing on the 30th and arrived at Qiugang near Anqing at 12 a.m., continuing west.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 30th] The political work office of the "7061" unit of the local garrison announced that on the evening of the 27th of this month, 21 local communist boats were discovered at the Linkou of Beishe in Taicang County. Each boat was carrying ten soldiers attempting to land forcibly, and they were repelled by the troops. In addition, on the night of the 28th, more than ten communist boats, full of communist troops, shot at the south bank with rifles at the Liuhekou northeast of Taicang, and they were also defeated by the troops.</p>
<h3>Policy Guidelines of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>1.  Preamble</p>
<p>At this critical juncture of national peril, Ying Qin has been entrusted with the position of President of the Executive Yuan. With limited talent but significant responsibilities, I deeply fear being unequal to the task. However, having received the nomination of the Acting President and the approval of your esteemed Yuan, I must reluctantly accept this weighty mission and devote all my efforts to it. I have primarily been involved in military affairs and have rarely concerned myself with politics. However, upon observing the current situation, I believe that striving for peace is essential to safeguard the foundation of the nation; political reform is essential to reverse decline and rectify long-standing issues; military reform is essential to defend the country and protect the people; and financial reform is essential to stabilize the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Since the victory, the flames of war have not ceased, the nation's strength has been almost exhausted, and the suffering of the people has deepened. Therefore, seeking peace is the unanimous desire of the people nationwide. It is imperative to seek peace with the utmost sincerity and tolerance to solidify the foundation of the nation.</p>
<p>In recent years, the social atmosphere has deteriorated, manifested in politics as perfunctoriness, corruption, and incompetent venality. To reverse decline and rectify long-standing issues and restore the social atmosphere, it is imperative to reform politics with the utmost courage and decisiveness, eradicate old corruption, and make a fresh start with the people.</p>
<p>After prolonged warfare during the War of Resistance, the organizational structure of the military has expanded, making the supply of military provisions more challenging. Consequently, the official number of personnel often exceeds the actual number, and discipline has not been fully rectified, leading to a decline in military reputation and morale. It is imperative to verify personnel numbers and actively reorganize with the utmost determination and effort, ensuring a lean and well-supplied force with strict discipline to fulfill the responsibility of defending the country and protecting the people.</p>
<p>Today, the nation's finances and financial system are severely depleted, and the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Compounded by declining currency confidence and rising prices, the majority of the people are unable to meet their basic needs for food and warmth, let alone maintain their minimum standard of living. It is imperative to reform with the utmost perseverance and conviction, aiming to streamline revenue and expenditure, maintain currency confidence, and increase production, so that finance, financial system, and economy can closely coordinate and mutually reinforce each other, ultimately achieving stability in the people's livelihood. The aforementioned matters are all pressing priorities. Other administrative affairs will be gradually improved based on their relative urgency. I hereby present the policy guidelines for this year, outlining the tasks that must be undertaken and can be implemented: As the ancient saying goes, "Good governance lies not in excessive pronouncements." I can only be diligent and pragmatic, seek truth from facts, and strive to navigate these difficult times with utmost sincerity. I hope that the esteemed members of your Yuan will provide guidance and assistance, contributing to collective wisdom and effort to achieve peace and national construction. This is not only my personal heartfelt prayer.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Regarding Production Loans</h3>
<p>After the He cabinet's policy guidelines were approved at the Provisional Political Affairs Meeting on the 29th, Premier He presented a policy report to the Legislative Yuan yesterday morning. The report placed particular emphasis on support for production in the areas of finance, financial system, economy, and transportation, and four measures will be adopted: (1) prudently provide production loans; (2) adopt a key-point approach to increase production; (3) encourage people to invest in productive enterprises; and (4) develop rural sideline occupations and handicrafts. Today, when the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the He cabinet's adoption of only the above four measures to achieve the goals of stabilizing the economy and ensuring the people's livelihood is, of course, a significant challenge. However, the thirsty person easily craves a drink, and the hungry person easily craves food. When the nation's productive enterprises are currently in a state of stagnation, hearing Premier He's policy report, that the government is determined to do its best to support productive enterprises, it is impossible not to regard this as a ray of light in the darkness, especially regarding the expectation of the government's "prudently providing production loans," which is the most urgent.</p>
<p>In recent years, the widespread scarcity of funds for our country's productive enterprises has been a major factor hindering industrial progress. However, the government's intermittent loans over the years have also provided considerable assistance to the struggling industrial sector. Looking back on the industrial loans issued in recent years, although there are distinctions in name such as production loans, emergency industrial loans, order loans, small industrial loans, and the purchase of finished products, in reality, they are nothing more than temporary, low-interest loans provided around the end of the year to meet urgent needs. Recently, in addition to the authorities issuing ten measures for order loans, they are also in the process of drafting measures for production loans. Before these measures are announced, we would like to propose several principles for the reference of the financial authorities.</p>
<p>First, the loan recipients: Are they truly industries related to democratic national defense? Do their products meet the standards of general industry? Do they truly feel a lack of funds? Are their operating conditions meeting normal requirements? All of these should be carefully investigated in advance.</p>
<p>Second, the loan criteria: Strict regulations should be established, with all decisions based on the actual conditions of the factories. Loans should not be given as gifts due to personal connections or the influence of a few special individuals, leaving the majority of factories that truly need funds unable to obtain them.</p>
<p>Third, the loan supervision: In addition to the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee making decisions on loans, it must also authorize and hold the lending banks accountable for seriously assessing the use of funds by the factories that received loans, and comparing the production situation before and after the loans. Only then can the prosperity of productive enterprises be promoted and the inertia of manufacturers relying on loans be eliminated.</p>
<p>Fourth, the loan collateral: It is best to avoid using raw materials, finished products, and semi-finished products, because the purpose of the loan is solely to help manufacturers alleviate the shortage of working capital in the production process. If raw materials and semi-finished products are used as collateral, it is tantamount to preventing them from re-producing, and even promoting their excuse for hoarding, harming the entire national economy, from the saying "It is better to do business than to manufacture, and it is better to hoard than to do business." Therefore, I personally advocate that loans should be secured with real estate and machinery. In addition, in order to ensure the safety of the loan, it can also be stipulated separately that guarantees be provided by the trade association and two reputable shops, along with the guarantee.</p>
<p>Fifth, the loan term: It should still be stipulated separately based on the nature of heavy industry and light industry. Under the current circumstances, with the value of currency fluctuating daily, it is difficult to lend all of the long-term funds needed by factories. Therefore, we advocate that loans for heavy industry should still be for a term of three months, and loans for light industry should still be for a term of two months. When they are due, the decision to roll over or recall them should be made separately based on the effectiveness of the factory that received the loan.</p>
<p>Sixth, the loan interest rate: It should not be excessively low, and it is most appropriate to be close to the market rate, because the overall environment is such that it is not easy for the country to extract a portion of its strength to lend to factories in the midst of great difficulty. If the interest rate is too low, it will inevitably create benefits for a few people, which is also unreasonable.</p>
<p>Seventh, the loan procedures: They should be as simple as possible. Do not let factories feel a headache when they see complex forms, and do not teach factories that when they receive a loan, they feel that the purpose has changed from when they applied, and that it is not of much help. Therefore, in order to save time, many delays in the transfer of agencies should be reduced as much as possible. It is best for factories to apply for loans directly to the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee, which may be faster in terms of procedures.</p>
<p>Eighth, the source of loan funds: It must not rely on the issuance of currency again, increasing the burden on the entire nation. It is most appropriate if loans can be handled based on the situation of each national bank's own position (including the Central Bank itself).</p>
<p>The eight principles mentioned above are indeed what the government authorities cannot ignore when prudently providing production loans. Currently, we certainly sympathize with the difficult situation of the industrial sector, but when the majority of the people are still struggling on the hunger line, we cannot help but pay attention to obtaining the maximum efficiency of the funds flowing out of the country. It is best to issue more fixed-order loans and effectively control materials; otherwise, it is also necessary to agree with the relevant trade associations in advance that they have the right to designate the destination of their products, in order to regulate other needed places, thereby stabilizing the supply relationship.</p>
<p>In short, today the country and the nation's productive enterprises are both in a precarious situation. We deeply hope that everyone will understand the difficulties of the times and follow the correct principles to handle matters. The personnel handling the loans should be particularly honest and conscientious, so that the nation's productive enterprises can all benefit from the real benefits. At the same time, the industrial sector must also work hard to improve the quality and quantity of products. In this way, the production loans organized by the authorities today will not fall through!</p>
<h3>The National Assembly's Shanghai Liaison Association Cables, Stating its Stance on Peace Talks, Insisting on Four Major Principles such as Political Democracy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The National Assembly's Shanghai Liaison Association, in a discussion and decision on the attitude towards peace talks on the previous (29th) day, yesterday (30th) formally sent a telegram to Acting President Li, Premier He, and liaison associations of National Assembly representatives in various regions, expressing that in this peace talk, the government should strive for equal and comprehensive peace within a reasonable and legal scope, and must adhere to the four major principles of political democracy, economic equality, social stability, and freedom of life, and requested that a temporary meeting of the National Assembly be convened soon according to the National Assembly's resolution last year, to make the final decision. The original text of the two telegrams is as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Acting President Li, et al.</p>
<p>"Urgent, to Acting President Li of Nanjing, Premier He, and forwarded to Zhang Wenbai, Shao Lizi, Huang Jikuan, Zhang Xingyan, Li Yunting, Liu Weizhang, Six Representatives: Reports say that government representatives are about to fly to Peiping to begin peace talks. This is truly a major event related to the nation and the people, and is by no means to be monopolized by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. For the government, in particular, it must not forget its own position, which was produced by the National Assembly last year in accordance with the Constitution. If the Constitution is ignored first, and the National Assembly is disregarded, may I ask what position and what power will you rely on to negotiate with the Communist Party? At today's meeting, this Association unanimously believes that in this peace talk, the government should strive for equal and comprehensive peace within a reasonable and legal scope, and what must be adhered to should be: (1) political democracy, (2) economic equality, (3) social security, (4) freedom of life, and other four major principles. As for the necessity of all troops being owned by the state and the necessity of protecting basic human rights, these are even more matters of course and cannot be compromised in any way. The undersigned also believe that any amendments to the Constitution and the political system are absolutely within the jurisdiction of the National Assembly, and no one should be allowed to overstep their authority. In particular, it is proposed that the government convene a temporary meeting of the National Assembly immediately in accordance with the National Assembly's resolution last year to make the final decision. This is a telegram submitted, and we sincerely hope that it will be accepted. Shanghai Liaison Association of National Assembly Representatives, knocking [with respect], Yin Yan One."</p>
<p>Telegram to National Representatives of Various Provinces and Cities</p>
<p>"To the liaison associations of National Assembly representatives of the senates of various provinces and cities, and forwarded to National Assembly representatives: Peace talks are about to begin, and the people's interests are at stake. This Association has convened representatives in Shanghai and decided to send telegrams to Acting President Li and Premier He, proposing that the peace talks should be reasonable and legal, adhere to the four major principles of political democracy, economic equality, social security, and freedom of life, and strive for equal and comprehensive peace. It is also believed that at this time of great turbulence and political change, a temporary meeting of the National Assembly should be convened immediately in accordance with the National Assembly's resolution last year to solemnly discuss the content of the peace talk conditions, so as to make the final decision, sincerely because it concerns the survival of the country and the nation, and the government and the Communist Party should not be allowed to monopolize it. If you agree, please advocate unanimously and promote its realization. This is a telegram sent, respectfully awaiting your instructions. Shanghai Liaison Association of National Assembly Representatives, knocking [with respect], Yin Yan Two."</p>
<h3>CCP Troops Attacking Vietnam Were Repelled Across the Border</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 30th] The CCP troops that invaded the Tonkin region of Vietnam from the Chinese border and attacked Mong Cai (according to yesterday's Associated Press telegram, translated as Mongki) have now retreated back into Chinese territory. The French authorities have completely controlled the area. Sixty CCP troops were killed, and all French nationals are safe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] A telegram from Hanoi states: Chinese Communist guerrillas invaded Mong Cai in northern Vietnam from Guangdong two days ago and carried out looting. Residents fled to the city hall. French reinforcements have rushed to protect them. As of today, a portion of the city is not in the hands of the Communist elements. The French army is making every effort to advance in order to restore order. Hanoi officials have expressed satisfaction with the situation there. Yesterday, a French plane, braving machine-gun fire, landed at an airport half a mile outside Mong Cai to evacuate some of the wounded. The Mong Cai radio station is still broadcasting. The CCP guerrillas invaded the city on the 27th, colluding with the Fifth Column lurking in the city and providing assistance.</p>
<h3>Employees of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway Go on Strike</h3>
<p>Demanding Clearance of Salaries for February and March</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 30th] The Hunan-Guizhou Railway is brewing a hunger strike. According to the Railway Bureau, Hengyang Station has already gone on strike.

<h3>US Congressmen to Submit Report, Requesting Comprehensive Aid to China, Congressman Judd Opposes "Piecemeal" Foreign Aid Bill</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] It was learned on the 29th that two minority party reports requesting comprehensive aid to the democratic forces in China will be submitted to the House of Representatives in a few days. The first report is being drafted by Republican Congressman Walter Judd and Congressman Judd. They intend to protest against the "piecemeal" passage of the foreign aid bill and urge comprehensive economic and military assistance to the Chinese Nationalist government. The other two, Fulton and Javits, want to give aid to any independent and democratic factions in China, not limited to the Kuomintang, and emphasize economic rather than military support. These two reports will be submitted as "minority opinions" to the House bill extending the Economic Cooperation Act. A member of the Foreign Affairs Committee told the Associated Press that the majority party report on China in the Foreign Affairs Committee was submitted on the 28th. The report supports the extension of aid to China, but opposes large-scale appropriations pending a "comprehensive review" of the situation in the Far East. The member said that in any case, the committee is expected to design a comprehensive plan for China's recovery during the current congressional session. Congressman Judd told the Associated Press that "unless the Communist Party completely controls China in the spring, this congressional session will definitely have an aid-to-China bill." He also said that even if the Communist Party completely controls China, he will advocate a bill to support the government in exile so that the democratic forces can actively resist the Communist Party.</p>

The funds are drawn from the US$275 million approved by Congress last year for the recovery of China. It is said that the number of students to be assisted has not yet been estimated. It is reported that there are currently more than 4,000 Chinese students studying at universities and vocational schools in the United States, but only a very small number are eligible for the above assistance.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 30th] More than 2,000 students, faculty, staff, workers, and police of Guangxi University surrounded the Central Bank at 2:00 p.m. on the 30th, because the school's funds of more than 35 million yuan in the Central Bank could not be withdrawn on the 26th, which aroused public outrage.

<h3>Opinions Offered by the Harmony Promotion Association, Telegraphing a Request for Adoption by Both the Government and the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The National Peace Promotion Association, considering that peace talks are about to begin, has specifically put forward three opinions and telegraphed a request for adoption by both the central government and the Chinese Communists. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To President Li, Premier He, and all peace talk representatives of the government in Nanjing; To Chairman Mao and all peace talk representatives of the Chinese Communist Party in Beiping: We are pleased to hear that representatives from both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will begin peace talks tomorrow to resolve suspicions and restore amity. This opportunity must not be lost. Our association has repeatedly telegraphed appeals to both sides to immediately issue cease-fire orders to demonstrate sincerity. However, recent rumors indicate that the artillery fire along the Yangtze River is intensifying. How can this inspire trust in the people? This is the first matter that we ask you to clarify. The content of the peace talks is crucial to the survival and interests of all people. Furthermore, national sovereignty belongs to the people. Therefore, in addition to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, representatives from popular opinion institutions should participate in the peace talks, and reporters from both sides should be allowed to freely gather news and disclose it at any time to demonstrate frankness and impartiality. This is the second matter that we ask you to adopt. As for the Constitution, it is the fundamental law of the country. Even if it can be amended according to the law, it must never be arbitrarily discarded. Freedom is the basic right of the people, and human rights should be respected by any government. The political democratization, economic socialization, and nationalization of the military, which were previously proposed in our telegram, are not only the principles of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in past years but also the common desire of the people throughout the country. These principles should still be adhered to in this peace talk without change. This is the third matter that we ask you to uphold. In summary, if you truly wish to end the war and make peace, everything should be based on obeying public opinion and respecting the law. Otherwise, without proper principles and legal safeguards, chaos will only increase, and how can we hope to see peace and stability again? We are specifically telegraphing to ask you to set aside your personal opinions, be calm, and plan for the long-term peace and stability of the country. We would be most fortunate. The National Peace Promotion Association, Yin Xian.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan's Policy Guidelines, Continued from Page One</h3>
<p>B. Regarding Military Affairs:</p>
<p>1.  Frontline troops will maintain their existing defensive lines and preserve the current situation to facilitate the smooth progress of peace talks.</p>
<p>2.  Adopt a policy of elite troops, reducing the number of military personnel to the minimum necessary to adapt to the current situation. All equipment, training, soldiers, and organization should be refined, new, and practical.</p>
<p>3.  Increase the salaries and benefits of officers and soldiers to ensure they can maintain a minimum standard of living. Subsidies for food, forage, office expenses, travel expenses, operating expenses, and equipment expenses must meet actual needs.</p>
<p>4.  Implement transparency in personnel matters, finances, and opinions. Promote a spirit of verification and rigorously conduct reviews at all levels. Rewards and punishments must be fair and consistent, avoiding hypocrisy, perfunctoriness, self-deception, and affectation. Ensure that orders from above are carried out below, and information from below reaches the top.</p>
<p>5.  Adjust the organization of the Ministry of National Defense, streamline non-essential units, and reduce excessive personnel to improve the effectiveness of command, supervision, and communication. The separation of planning and execution of business must also be redefined to ensure harmony and connection.</p>
<p>6.  Improve the conscription system. Conscription agencies should be integrated into local administrative agencies to specialize responsibilities and save manpower. In addition, strengthen local people's self-defense organizations to ensure an ample supply of soldiers and facilitate conscription and demobilization.</p>
<p>C. Regarding Fiscal and Monetary Affairs:</p>
<p>1.  Land taxes will be returned to local control, and a portion of national taxes will be allocated for local collection. Except for remote and impoverished provinces, the central government will no longer provide subsidies.</p>
<p>2.  Various fees for transportation and public utilities will be calculated based on cost and adjusted regularly to achieve self-sufficiency and no longer rely entirely on subsidies from the national treasury.</p>
<p>3.  Customs import duties will be calculated in Customs Gold Units (關元). A fixed ratio will be established between Customs Gold Units and foreign currencies. Gold Yuan Certificates (金圓劵) will be used to purchase and pay customs duties and will not circulate on the market.</p>
<p>4.  Establish a "Tax Unit" system to ensure tax revenue and avoid delays and losses in payment. All taxes, except customs duties, will be calculated and paid in Tax Units. Each Tax Unit will be equivalent to one-tenth of a gram of gold by the market system. Taxpayers will purchase with Gold Yuan Certificates, which will be used exclusively for paying taxes and will not circulate on the market.</p>
<p>5.  Levy property taxes to have the wealthy contribute, in accordance with the demands of the people throughout the country.</p>
<p>6.  Provide production loans, giving priority to industries producing daily necessities to facilitate the purchase of raw materials and foreign exchange settlement, to increase production and cultivate tax revenue.</p>
<p>7.  The free buying and selling of gold and silver will be permitted. The Central Bank may also buy and sell gold and silver to stabilize market prices and currency values.</p>
<p>8.  Silver dollars will be allowed to circulate. The government will procure silver and mint silver dollars to increase the amount in circulation and gradually consolidate the currency system.</p>
<p>9.  Encourage exports and remittances from overseas Chinese to increase the source of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>10. Establish cost-of-living deposit accounts or other value-preserving deposits to protect the people from losses due to currency devaluation.</p>
<p>D. Regarding Economic and Transportation Affairs:</p>
<p>1.  Increase production, adopting a focus on key areas. The types of products to be increased will be mainly daily necessities, important industrial raw materials, and import and export goods. For domestic sales, attention will be paid to improving living standards while saving labor and materials. For exports, efforts will be made to standardize products to meet the needs of the international market.</p>
<p>2.  Encourage private investment in production enterprises.</p>
<p>3.  Develop rural sideline occupations and handicrafts to compensate for the lack of equipment and power.</p>
<p>4.  Improve the transportation system and encourage exports to enrich the national economy.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived here on the "Queen Mary" in preparation for attending the signing ceremony of the North Atlantic Treaty.

When asked if the Atlantic Treaty needed to be fulfilled, he replied, "Of course," and said that this treaty proclaims to the world that democracy will finally unite in times of crisis. When a reporter asked Gromyko, the chief representative of the Soviet Union who arrived on the same ship, Mr. Gromyko replied that he would not make any formal statements. The reporter then asked Bevin again if he anticipated the result of the North Atlantic Treaty to be peace or war. Mr. Bevin replied, "If we are attacked, we can certainly take action quickly, but we would rather take steady and slow steps to cultivate our strength. I am not afraid of early attacks. If we want to maintain peace, it depends on how united people are." Other representatives of various countries who came to the United States on the same ship included Yugoslav Foreign Minister Popovic, Belgian Prime Minister Spaak, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Bech, and Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker.</p>
<h3>Syrian Army Launches Lightning Coup; Government Overthrown, All Cabinet Members Arrested; Generally Believed to Be a Prelude to Realizing Greater Syria</h3>
<p>[United Press, Amman, 30th] Syrian Army Chief of Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie Colonel Zaim launched a lightning coup on the evening of the 29th, arresting government officials, issuing strict martial law, and warning that anyone carrying firearms without authorization would be executed on the spot. A statement signed by the "Armed Forces Headquarters" and broadcast by the Damascus Radio Station in the Syrian capital stated that Prime Minister al-Azm and all cabinet ministers had been arrested. (There are conflicting reports about the whereabouts of President al-Quwatli. Reports from Beirut said that he was arrested along with cabinet members, while reports from Cairo said that he had fled to Lebanon.)</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: Damascus reports that the Syrian army has arrested a large number of officials after taking over the government and stated that it will hold civic elections to decide on the members of the new government. According to all indications, the purpose of this coup is clearly to obstruct Syria's reconciliation with Israel. There was no violent action when the army took over this afternoon, and the country was as peaceful as ever. Army Chief of Staff Zaim, the main leader of the coup, told reporters that this takeover of the government is temporary, pending the establishment of a new democratic regime. Zaim also said that he is negotiating with Khalil, the Syrian representative to the United Nations and chairman of the Syrian Parliament, to immediately establish a legitimate new government. Another report said that Asseily, another Syrian representative to the United Nations, is responsible for organizing the new government. Zaim also said that the army's action is purely an internal affair and has no foreign influence whatsoever. Zaim also warned that if anyone attempts to covet Syrian territory and sovereignty, the army will take decisive action.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Amman, 30th] Damascus Radio broadcast that Syrian Army Commander-in-Chief Colonel Zaim has assumed the position of dictator and established a military regime in Syria. Colonel Zaim told the Syrian people through the station, stating that his seizure of power was due to the worsening situation and to expel those who claim to be national elements. This emergency measure is necessary until a democratic government is established in Syria. The station also published another proclamation issued by Zaim, announcing martial law throughout the country and implementing traffic control in all cities and towns throughout the country from 6:00 a.m. local time until the notice is lifted. Syria has a population of 3.2 million and is one of the more intelligent Arab countries. Recently, the country's army has expressed great dissatisfaction with the government's signing of a truce agreement with Israel.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 30th] Well-informed political figures say that the coup in Syria may be a prelude to King Abdullah of Transjordan's long-cherished Greater Syria ambitions. The Arab Bureau in London said, "This is just the beginning of similar events within Arab countries. This is clearly a direct result of the Palestine catastrophe."</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Washington, 30th Broadcast: Acheson announced at a press conference that he has appointed Barker as a special assistant to draft the military aid plan.

The duration of the plan is probably more than one year, but the amount requested for approval is only for one year. Acheson also said that under the current plan, the bill does not designate the countries that will receive assistance. He said that the meeting on Saturday will discuss the organization of the committee to implement the treaty. He also said that after Truman delivers a speech at the signing ceremony, the foreign ministers of various countries will speak in succession and then sign one by one in alphabetical order. The final procedures for the signing ceremony are still awaiting approval from the foreign ministers of various countries and President Truman.</p>

<h3>Industrial Representatives Travel to Beijing Together: Submitting Opinions on North-South Bartering, Carrying an Outline of Bartering Methods, etc., Presented to President He</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Industrial Association, recognizing the increasingly urgent need to realize North-South bartering, previously appointed ten representatives in the last joint meeting of directors and supervisors to go to Beijing to present their opinions to the central authorities. It is now learned that these representatives have been discussing matters for several days and have formulated a bartering outline based on the opinions of various industries, as well as a list of items to be exchanged. This bartering outline and list of goods were approved at yesterday afternoon's meeting of the Industrial Association's standing directors. Besides some representatives already in Beijing, Liu Hongsheng, Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, Hong Nianzu, Cai Xintao, Hu Xiyuan, Yao Shushen, and seven others set off for Beijing last night. They will present to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Communications the current crisis facing the industrial sector and the need for North-South bartering. If this proposal can be approved by the authorities, the North-South bartering plan can be realized in the short term. The full text of the Industrial Association's resolution to present to President He is recorded below:</p>
<p>We believe that the operation of industry and commerce in various regions depends entirely on the exchange of goods and the mutual exchange of goods, so that they can prosper and grow and avoid suffocation. The prosperity or decline of the social economy also rises and falls with this. Since last winter's Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign, the abandonment of Jiangbei, and the partial peaceful settlement of Tianjin and Beijing, Shanghai's industrial sector has been facing increasingly difficult circumstances due to the lack of raw materials and the shrinking sales area. All of Anshan and Longyan's iron, Kailuan, China Xing, and Huainan's coal, Fengyang and Xuchang's tobacco leaves, Tianjin and Yongli's alkali, peanuts and soybeans needed by the oil pressing industry, cotton and wool needed by the textile industry, pig bristles and animal bones needed by the toothbrush industry, raw hides needed by the leather industry, etc., are all restricted by region and cannot come south. Furthermore, products manufactured in Shanghai, such as cloth, wool, dyes, medicines, machinery, tires, rubber shoes, bicycles, light bulbs, flashlights, paint, towels, sheets, underwear, enamelware, aluminumware, silk, bakelite products, seasonings, soap, tea, hardware, paper, and various household chemicals, etc., have traditionally relied on North China and Jiangbei as their main markets, but now they cannot be transported for sale. Although they may be nearby, there are no merchants coming and going, and trade is completely cut off. Our industrial sector is in a difficult situation. On the one hand, we feel that fuel and raw materials cannot be obtained, and on the other hand, sales are shrinking, finished products are piling up, and capital turnover is sluggish, forcing us to reduce work and production. However, normal expenses cannot be reduced, and losses are increasing. Those with a slightly thicker foundation find it difficult to manage, and those with smaller scales have to stop operating. If this continues, we will all perish together. Fortunately, you have taken over the Executive Yuan and are committed to peace and economic recovery. You must have been deeply considering the difficulties and hardships of the industrial sector. Feeling the urgent need to ourselves, our industrial sector has convened meetings several times to discuss and study conducting bartering and trial trade with North China and Jiangbei, so that the products of both sides can be mutually circulated. All exchanged goods are limited to the needs of the people and industrial raw materials, so as to avoid goods being滞留 on the ground, being used by neighboring countries, or bypassing Hong Kong Island, wasting physical resources. In the past, our exchange of flour for their coal has been effective, and shipping industry leaders have contacted them to negotiate shipping, which is also showing promise. Recent reports of the opening of telecommunications, postal services, and remittances are all being carried out one after another. If the trade issue can be carried out along with it, not only will the livelihoods of the more than eighty industries and more than 12,000 factories belonging to this association and the hundreds of thousands of employees be guaranteed, but also the peace that you have been seeking day and night can be achieved with favorable progress. If this matter can be approved in principle, concrete measures should be formulated in terms of implementation technology to ensure thoroughness and facilitate progress. We have now prepared an outline of North-South bartering methods and a list of North-South cargo names and quantities, and the association has appointed representatives Liu Hongsheng, Shu Yunzhang, Yang Guanbei, Liu Piji, Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, Hong Nianzu, Cai Xintao, Hu Xiyuan, and Yao Shushen to go to Beijing to present them for your inspection, hoping that you will grant them adoption and implementation. We are waiting for your orders with utmost urgency. Respectfully presented to He, President of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Rent Standards Can Be Determined: Conveners of Participating Groups Have Exchanged Opinions: Visiting the Mayor Today to Suggest Maximizing Reduction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The issue of rent standards in this city, after several studies by the Land Administration Bureau and the Municipal Government Councilors' Office, has reached the final stage and can be announced after discussion and decision at tomorrow's Municipal Government meeting. Councilors Jiang Hao, Zhang Zhongyuan, Chen Peide, Ma Junshuo, Zhou Lianze, Zhu Yakui, Ye Xianggao, Zhang Xuelian, Yao Baozhen, etc., agreed with Mayor Wu yesterday to visit Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 4:00 PM today, representing the Land Administration, Social Affairs, and Regulations Committees of the Municipal Council, and the Tenants' General Federation, respectively, to contribute opinions on determining rent standards to Mayor Wu.</p>
<p>Previously Determined Plan: Divided into Five Levels</p>
<p>It is reported that the rent standards previously formulated by the Councilors' Office are divided into five levels: (1) For pre-war rents below 50 yuan, 20% (i.e., 10 yuan) is taken, multiplied by the current cost of living index, as the current rent. (2) For pre-war rents between 51 yuan and 100 yuan, 15% is taken as the base. (3) For pre-war rents between 101 yuan and 200 yuan, 20% is taken as the base. (4) For pre-war rents between 201 yuan and 300 yuan, 25% is taken as the base. (5) For pre-war rents above 300 yuan, 30% is taken as the base. After the above rent standards were set, both the Municipal Council and the Tenants' General Federation believed that they were too high and difficult for citizens to bear, so they suggested that the Municipal Government calculate them at half of the original standard. Mayor Wu believes that after the rent standards are divided into five levels, various disputes will inevitably arise between tenants and landlords in the future, and believes that it is necessary to study them carefully. Therefore, they were not approved at last week's Municipal Government meeting and were decided to be reviewed by the Councilors' Office and submitted to the Municipal Government meeting for discussion and decision tomorrow.</p>
<p>Councilors Exchange Opinions</p>
<p>In order to discuss the rent standard issue, Zhang Xuelian, convener of the Land Administration Group of the Municipal Council, Zhang Zhongyuan, Ye Xianggao, Yao Baozhen, and Zhou Lianze of the Social Affairs Group, Ma Junshuo and Zhu Yakui of the Regulations Group, and Councilors Jiang Hao and Chen Peide of the Tenants' General Federation, held a discussion meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to exchange opinions. They unanimously believe that the rent standard is related to the burden of all Shanghai citizens, and the Municipal Government should reduce it as much as possible. They believe that if the Municipal Government feels that the rent classification method is inappropriate, it can be divided into residential and commercial buildings. As for the rent standard, it will be suggested that Mayor Wu base it on the original proposal of the Eighth General Assembly of the Municipal Council, that is, for residential buildings, convert the pre-war rent into gold yuan coupons, take 5% per yuan, and multiply it by the current cost of living index, which is equivalent to taking 5% of the pre-war rent as the base. For example, if the pre-war rent was 50 yuan, the base would be 2.5 yuan. For commercial buildings, 6% per yuan will be taken. This standard is very different from that set by the Councilors' Office, and whether the Municipal Government can accept it will depend on the results of today's discussion with Mayor Wu. In any case, the rent standards in this city can be determined at tomorrow's meeting.</p>
<h3>Lower Half of March: Cost of Living Index: Released Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Compilation and Review Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at 10:00 AM today in the Municipal Government Conference Room to review and announce the fixed base period index and the chain relative index of the cost of living for employees in the second half of this month. This period's employee cost of living index is the first item after the improved compilation, and the Municipal Government Statistics Office is stepping up its compilation.</p>
<h3>Workers' Salary Payment: Cash Won't Be a Problem</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issue of workers' salary payments, according to Director Cao Peizi of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, the cash panic may be alleviated and there will be no serious situation. The Central Bank is considering the Social Affairs Bureau's suggestion to relax the cash withdrawal limit for manufacturers and to issue silver dollars and fixed-amount promissory notes, and this is under consideration by the vice president. Director Cao believes that the current serious threats to manufacturers are high interest rates, narrow sales channels, and business shrinking, and the cost of living index for employees is no longer a major stimulus for manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Heads of Various Bureaus and Offices of the Municipal Government: Handling Fake Handover: The Mayor Will Travel to Hangzhou for a Spring Outing at the Beginning of the Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, various bureaus and offices of the Municipal Government handled fake handovers, and prepared lists of completed official matters in each department, as well as those that had not been completed, and handed them over to the Municipal Government Secretariat for compilation. It is reported that Mayor Wu is scheduled to take leave from April 1st and leave Shanghai for a spring outing in Hangzhou at the beginning of the month, with a vacation of ten days to half a month. After the vacation, he will still return to Shanghai, but he will firmly resign from the position of mayor. He hopes that by the time he returns to Shanghai, the central government has already decided on a new candidate, so that formal handover procedures can be carried out. Furthermore, he will no longer approve the resignations of the heads of various bureaus before his own resignation is approved.</p>
<h3>The Headless Dismembered Corpse Will Be Exhumed Again Today: The Investigation Results Show Two People Are Similar: Suspects Are Under Close Surveillance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of the headless dismembered corpse on Jinyi Road has achieved considerable success after days of investigation by the police and relevant agencies, and the truth will soon be revealed. The investigation of the case is based on a study of recent missing persons, constantly narrowing the scope. As a result of the summary, there are five people who are more likely, and finally only two people remain, who are quite similar to the dismembered corpse investigated in this case. One of them was discovered by the Changshu Police Sub-bureau, and the other was discovered by other agencies. Detailed investigations have been carried out on the characteristics of the missing persons, such as height, weight, skin and hair color, scars on the body, and skin diseases. The police bureau is scheduled to exhume the coffin today together with the forensic doctor to determine who the victim belongs to. If there are characteristics in the thirty-two pieces of the corpse that match the characteristics, the case will take a sharp turn and can be solved immediately. However, considering the meticulousness of the murderer in destroying the corpse and eliminating traces, the characteristics on the deceased's body may have been destroyed, and it may not be possible to find the characteristics in these thirty-two remains. However, if the missing parts match the characteristics on the deceased's body, it will also be a strong counter-evidence. As for the identity of the deceased, according to the investigation results, the deceased may have had a criminal record. The murderer cut off his fingers for the purpose of destroying his fingerprints so that the identity of the deceased could not be determined. After the case-handling personnel investigated from various aspects, it has been determined that this is undoubtedly a vendetta case. Before the murderer is apprehended, this newspaper will continue to keep it secret for the sake of prudence. But it can be asserted that the suspects involved in the case are under close surveillance by the investigation network arranged by the police detectives, and the time of apprehension is not far away.</p>
<h3>Shui Yao Chen Disappears in Hangzhou: The Police Bureau Is Investigating His Whereabouts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hangzhou 30th Report] On the eve of the discovery of the headless dismembered corpse in Shanghai, a man named Shui Yao Chen disappeared in Hangzhou. He was from Yin County, 44 years old, and lived at 22 Yiru Lane, Tiantong Road, Shanghai. Shui came to Hangzhou on the 17th to mourn his teacher, Sun Yici, the former director of the Zhejiang Provincial News Office, who was 57 years old, and disappeared on the 17th. On the 21st, a headless dismembered corpse was discovered on Jinyi Road. Shui's family came to Hangzhou to look for him but could not find him, and placed a missing person advertisement in the newspaper on the 28th. The Changshu Road Police Sub-bureau in Shanghai read the newspaper and went to inquire, suspecting that he was the victim of the dismemberment case. Deputy Director Wang Sizu and detective Zhu Yunrong specially came to Hangzhou yesterday. After investigating with relevant parties today, it is believed that Shui's wife may be the one. The reasons are said to be the following: (1) He is burly, and his long gown can fit the corpse. (2) Shui's shirt collar is 16 inches, and the corpse is the same. (3) Shui's feet have characteristics, scars on the toes, gray spots on the nails, and moisture on the feet. The corpse's fingerprints and toes were cut off. (4) The dates of Shui's disappearance and the discovery of the dismemberment case coincide. It is found that Shui was originally a wealthy businessman. During the occupation period, he opened the Dada Money Shop at the entrance of Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, Shanghai, and engaged in export trade, cotton cloth, etc. He has been unemployed for four years since the victory. He has a mother, a wife, and nine children. The eldest daughter is already 21 years old. He used to have a Suzhou concubine, but she has died. He has a very good relationship with his wife, and his wife must pack his luggage when he travels. When he left home on the 17th, his wife did not know where he was going, nor did she pack his luggage for him. His mother had seen him wandering around, thinking deeply and nodding. After arriving in Hangzhou, he stayed at the Huaxing Hotel on Zhongzheng Street, wearing a coffee-colored gown and black leather shoes, looking quite worried, and asked for a quiet room. After opening room 27, he asked the tea room who was in room 28 opposite, and was told it was the manager. He used his gown to pledge the room fee. On the 18th, he received 60,000 yuan remitted from Shanghai and went to Sun's house to mourn and送禮 6,000. He left without eating lunch. At 8:00 AM on the 19th, he told the tea room that he was going to Shaoxing. During the two days in the hotel, no guests visited him, and he only made one phone call. According to his sister Shui Xiu, he had no luggage, only a gold watch and a gold chain, and the gold buttons on his shirt weighed about seven钱. He has been missing ever since, with no news. After Deputy Director Wang investigated, he immediately telegraphed Shanghai to bring Shui's clothes and bedding to the bureau for investigation, and two police dogs were transported to Hangzhou. The latter has been transported today and will continue the investigation. According to the investigation, Shui had a quarrel with his wife before coming to Hangzhou.</p>

<h3>Affected by the Taiping Steamer Disaster: Employees of China Union Company Appeal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It has been two months since the Taiping Steamer of the China Union Company sank, and the aftermath has not been completely resolved. Recently, all employees of the company believed that the various measures taken by the families of the victims directly affected their livelihoods. Yesterday, they specially invited reporters to the Bank Club. Chen Yifeng, the head of the accounting department of the company and a representative of the employees, reported that since the Taiping Steamer disaster, the compensation requests made by the families of the victims to the China Union Company were divided into two parts: 162 people in Taiwan, each requesting 800石 of white rice, and 416 people in Shanghai, each requesting 35 million yuan. If the index changes when it is issued, it will be increased proportionally. This huge amount is currently equivalent to about 5,000 large gold bars, which is definitely not within the company's ability to bear. However, as of recently, the China Union Company has also made every effort to pay out most of it, including 288 ticketed passengers, each with 10石 of white rice, and 96 non-ticketed passengers, each with 7.5石 of white rice. In addition, each person was given 10,000 yuan two months ago, a total of 400 people. He said that the funds were borrowed separately by all employees from outside, so although the company is not bankrupt at present, the employees are heavily in debt. However, the families of the victims still cannot understand this. In addition to the company's Anlian Steamer being attached by them in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, the branch office address was also occupied. Recently, the families in Shanghai have even requested the attachment of the company's only general Hualian Steamer and plan to organize a committee to take over all businesses of China Union. They believe that if this is the case, the livelihoods of all employees will be cut off, the debts will be impossible to repay, and the company will be unable to fulfill its compensation obligations. Therefore, they requested that both parties should wait for legal solutions from now on and put forward eight appeals: (1) Please ask the company to stop all supplies to the representatives of the families of the victims in Taiwan and Shanghai from now on. (2) Require the company to find a way to pay off the debts owed by employees. (3) Request the families of the victims not to occupy the company's office anymore. (4) The representatives of the families of the victims should publish detailed accounts of all expenses received. (5) In the future, the company's payments should be supervised and reviewed by employee representatives. (6) In the future, when the company and the families of the victims have meetings to discuss, employee representatives should be allowed to attend, and any matters that hinder the welfare of employees may be vetoed immediately. (7) The company should legally protect the livelihoods of employees, otherwise all will file a complaint with the shareholders' meeting. (8) Request the company to thoroughly investigate and punish the dereliction of duty of the主管 personnel in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the families of the employees of the China Union Company sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to petition for assistance. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that this matter is not a labor dispute, but a legal issue, which is not under the jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Bureau, and only promised to assist in mediation within a possible range.</p>

<h3>Principal of Tsinghua Middle School: Accused of Abandonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Feng Shuhua, the principal of Tsinghua Middle School in this city who is also a lawyer, was recently accused of abandonment by Liu Huizhen, an obstetrician at Dada Hospital. The District Prosecutor's Office summoned him yesterday and ordered him to be released on bail pending trial. Liu said in the indictment that she lived with the defendant and gave birth to a son named Feng Dalong. Later, they separated for some reason, and Dalong was raised by the man. On December 2 last year, Dalong was ill, and Feng sent his son to Pua Hospital for treatment under the alias Zheng Fuming, but was soon declared incurable. Liu, because her son's life and death were unknown, suspected that Feng had abandoned him, and sued for investigation.</p>

Unexpectedly, after Bai arrived at the bank, because he saw many people remitting money, he placed the checks and the remittance book on the receipt counter, and then went to another window to collect promissory notes. When he returned to the original place, he found that the checks and the remittance book had been stolen. Bai was shocked and stood blankly by the counter, silently. It was not until 3:00 PM, when the bank closed, that the details were learned by the bank clerk's盘讯. Bai then returned to the store dejectedly and did not report the incident to the manager until about 6:00 PM.

<h3>Case of Framing a Priest: District Court Held First Trial Yesterday; Five Chinese and Foreign Defendants All Shirked Responsibility; Court Ordered Additional Witnesses to be Summoned for Retrial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The five defendants, Chinese and foreign, accused of framing Father George and extorting tens of thousands of US dollars - Egger, Krieg, Ilich, Jamie, and Wang Xianzhang - underwent a first trial yesterday afternoon presided over by Judge Chen Shijing of the District Court. Among them, the German Krieg, who spoke fluent and highly accurate Chinese, answered the court directly, employing various tones to express his intentions, no different from a Chinese person. He claimed to have been operating a coal business in China for many years. On December 2nd of last year, after being arrested by the police, his hands were cuffed and he was taken to Father George's house to search for stolen goods. It was alleged that Father George was illegally exchanging foreign currency. Opium paper packets and US dollars were found during the search. He was then taken back to the police station and released, forbidden from disclosing the matter to the outside world. He denied any other extortion or fraud. The other three foreign defendants, Egger, Ilich, and Jamie, through the statements of interpreters, completely denied any knowledge of the charges against them. Wang Xianzhang claimed that he had never been to Father George's house, but he knew that a Westerner named Albour (who is at large) had used apples to cook a black paste resembling opium, which was indeed the case. Subsequently, Father George, one of the victims, testified that during the extortion, Albour acted as a French translator, making contact back and forth. Krieg was also brought to his house in handcuffs on the day of the search. After repeated questioning by the court, it was ordered that additional witnesses be summoned, and a retrial was scheduled for the eighth of next month. Jamie was ordered to post a cash bail of one million gold yuan, Egger was ordered to be available upon summons, and the remaining three defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Two Railways to Prepare for Price Increase Tomorrow; Increase of 300 Percent; First-Class Ticket from Shanghai to Beijing on Special Express is 115,300</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The new railway fares are scheduled to take effect tomorrow (April 1st). The Ministry of Transportation has not yet issued a formal directive to Shanghai regarding the adjusted multiples. It is heard that the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau has calculated the new fares based on the adjusted fare standards set by the Legislative Yuan. The new fares will increase by approximately 300 percent. The basic passenger fare will increase from 20 yuan to 85 yuan per kilometer, and the freight fare will increase from 27 yuan to 114 yuan per kilometer. The Railway Bureau has already submitted this calculation method and adjusted multiples to the Ministry of Transportation for approval. If the Ministry approves the above new fares, the estimated passenger ticket prices for the two railways will be as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nanjing Line:</p>
<p>Ordinary train first-class ticket: Shanghai to Kunshan, 15,500 yuan; to Suzhou, 23,200 yuan; Wuxi, 33,500 yuan; Changzhou, 43,800 yuan; Danyang, 56,600 yuan; Zhenjiang, 64,400 yuan; Nanjing, 82,400 yuan. Special express first-class: Shanghai to Kunshan, 18,500 yuan; Suzhou, 27,800 yuan; Wuxi, 40,200 yuan; Changzhou, 52,500 yuan; Danyang, 68,000 yuan; Zhenjiang, 77,200 yuan; Nanjing, 98,800 yuan. Reserved seat train first-class: Shanghai to Suzhou, 32,500 yuan; Wuxi, 46,900 yuan; Changzhou, 61,300 yuan; Danyang, 79,300 yuan; Zhenjiang, 90,100 yuan; Nanjing, 115,300 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Line:</p>
<p>Ordinary train first-class ticket: Shanghai to Songjiang, 10,300 yuan; Jiaxing, 25,800 yuan; Hangzhou, 48,900 yuan. Special express first-class: Shanghai to Songjiang, 12,400 yuan; Jiaxing, 20,900 yuan; Hangzhou, 58,700 yuan. Reserved seat train first-class: Shanghai to Songjiang, 14,500 yuan; Jiaxing, 36,100 yuan; Hangzhou, 68,500 yuan.</p>
<p>The ratio of first, second, and third-class ticket prices remains 1:2:3. That is, the second-class ticket is two-thirds of the first-class price, and the third-class ticket is one-third of the first-class price.</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Office Notifies: Rice Shops Must Not Refuse Payment by Check</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to news from the Civil Affairs Office: Recently, citizens have been using checks to purchase rationed flour, and some rice shops have refused to sell. The office has notified the area commissioners stationed in each district to inform the rice shops that they must not refuse to accept checks. However, given the shortage of cash in the market and to take into account the actual difficulties faced by rice shops, citizens are requested not to use large-denomination checks to make purchases and force the rice shops to make change in cash.</p>
<h3>First Ration of Rice for April to Begin Distribution on the 5th</h3>
<p>Flour Will Also Be Included in the Ration</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The first round of rationed rice for April in this city has been decided upon in yesterday's food meeting and will begin distribution on the 5th. The ration price will be determined and announced by the Economic Coordination Committee at a meeting to be held at 3 p.m. on April 4th. In addition to rice, flour will also be included in the ration.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding the Zhabei Demonstration Zone; Budget Requires Over 50 Billion; A Distant Dream Still Requires a Considerable Period to Realize</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The "Zhabei" area, with the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway stations as major arteries handling over 100,000 people daily, and the Wusong River surrounding the southwest, enjoys exceptionally convenient land and water transportation. During the January 28th Incident and the August 13th Incident, the Japanese army invaded Shanghai twice, causing severe damage. The essence of the area was reduced to ashes, and many boundaries were obliterated, leading to frequent disputes among property owners. In view of this, the Shanghai Municipal Government decided to rebuild the western district of Zhabei as a demonstration area for land readjustment in the city. First, the Shanghai Urban Design Committee designed a land use plan and produced a zoning map for the western district of Zhabei. The Land Administration Bureau, based on this plan, designed a land readjustment plan and produced a land readjustment map for the western district of Zhabei. The map divides the area into seven neighborhood units, each with schools and green spaces. The entire area has an administrative center, police and fire sub-stations, and public docks and warehouses, as well as the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway stations, designated according to the original location and needs. The construction is divided into four phases. This plan and maps have been submitted to the Municipal Council for review and approved, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, due to financial difficulties, it has not yet been realized.</p>
<p>If the Plan Can Be Realized, a New World Can Be Opened Up</p>
<p>According to information gathered by our reporter from the Land Administration Bureau yesterday: the total area of the western district of Zhabei is 2,526.660 mu. If the future construction plan is successful, the area of residential land will account for 1,275.974 mu, railway land 245.216 mu, public buildings and green areas 326.380 mu, roads and local roads 679.090 mu. The construction cost for the entire area was estimated at 19,222,000.00 gold yuan during the currency reform of "August 19th" last year. Now, if calculated at 3,000 times, it would require approximately 57,666,000,000.00 yuan. The construction cost of over 50 billion yuan is feared to be beyond the reach of the current central government and local economic power.</p>
<p>If this plan can be realized, it will indeed open up a new world. The plan shows that residential buildings, schools, hospitals, government offices, shops, post offices, police stations and fire departments, stations, warehouses, waterworks, and roads are all well-organized. If construction is successful, it will become a model area for Shanghai.</p>
<p>Roads are Rugged and Uneven; Traces of War Still Remain</p>
<p>To understand the latest situation of Zhabei, the reporter drove to Zhabei yesterday for an on-site investigation. Crossing the railway and turning into Song Park Road, the roads were uneven, the car jumped and bumped severely, mud splashed everywhere, and both sides were lined with low thatched sheds. Those who had just come from Nanjing Road and Lin Sen Road felt as if they had suddenly fallen from the 20th century to the 18th century. Some places simply did not resemble roads. Near Zhongshan Road, there were many empty spaces. The bricks of the houses destroyed by artillery fire had been dismantled by the Japanese and local poor people, leaving the land leveled. Now, it has become large vegetable gardens.</p>
<p>Song Park is the only place for recreation in this area. We went in and paid respects to the statues of revolutionary martyrs. Mr. Song Jiaoren's statue appeared silent, with Zhang Binglin's seal script "Fisherman" below, and Yu Youren's inscription behind: "Mr. Song's death is a pity for the world; Mr. Song's actions are known to the world. What should I record? A truthful pen? A truthful pen! A crooked pen? A crooked pen deserves divine punishment. Alas! Tears of the underworld, blood of the world, pen of an old friend, ax of a thief, engraved on the empty mountain, awaiting good historians, inscribed in the heart, attested by heaven and earth." On both sides of the statue are two stone figures moved from the opposite side of the racecourse. The figures have been renovated, with black hats, white faces, and yellow robes, looking brand new, but there are no traces of incense. The park gatekeeper told reporters that the crisscrossing ditches and high mounds outside the gate were remnants of trenches and defensive works from the past, adding to the desolate feeling.</p>
<p>Empty Land Near Baziqiao; Most of the Owners are Gone</p>
<p>Then we turned to Liuying Road and drove to Baziqiao. The bridge crosses the Henghang River and connects Shuidian Road to the northeast, a vital thoroughfare from Jiangwan to Zhabei. During the bloody anti-Japanese war, it was the site of the tragic "eight in and eight out" battle. The reporter stood on the bridge, wanting to pay tribute to the relics of the war, but they were no longer visible. Only many newly built houses were seen. According to the local elders, the houses near the bridge were burned and destroyed in the war, leaving a flat expanse of land. Therefore, there was much empty land, and the topography had changed. After the war, most of the owners did not claim their land. As long as one spent more than ten dan of rice, one could pick any empty land to build a house, and no one would interfere. This situation is bound to cause many land disputes when Zhabei is rebuilt in the future.</p>
<p>As a result of the Zhabei tour, it is felt that this dilapidated place does need to be rebuilt. The question is how to raise this huge amount of construction funds? How to deal with these many shack dwellers? How to reorganize land registration? The plan is good, but realizing this plan will probably take a considerable period of time.</p>

<h3>Yankaolun Ship Nearly Caused Disaster En Route to Guangdong; Collision With Landing Craft Causes Damage to Both Sides; Both Ships Returned to Shanghai Yesterday for Repairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yankaolun ship, loaded with goods from Shanghai to Guangdong on the afternoon of the 29th at 1 p.m., encountered Landing Craft No. 109 returning from Guangdong to Shanghai at around 8 p.m. near Baiji Mountain in the waters of Fuzhou. Due to the darkness, the two ships collided and rubbed against each other. Fortunately, both sides avoided in time, averting a major disaster. However, both ships sustained minor damage. The iron plate at the bow of the Yankaolun ship was dented, and the iron plate on the port side of the landing craft, above the waterline, was also crushed by several feet. The landing craft arrived in Shanghai at around 9 a.m. yesterday and is currently docked at Pier 7. The Yankaolun ship immediately suspended its voyage to Guangdong and returned to Shanghai for repairs, arriving at port at 11 a.m. yesterday, docked at Zhangjiabang Pier. Both ships are awaiting inspection and repair.</p>
<h3>Raise Awareness of Curfew; Turn On and Off Street Lights Three Times</h3>
<p>To raise public awareness of the curfew, the garrison command previously stipulated that the city's electric lights should be turned on and off three times half an hour before the curfew was lifted every night. It is now learned that due to the different equipment of Shanghai's power companies compared to Beijing, Chongqing, and other places, a city-wide power outage would be difficult. It has been approved that the city's street lights will be turned on and off three times from now on.</p>

<h3>Survey of Ancient Tombs in Changzhou (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dayi</p>
<p>At around 10 p.m. on March 19th, Mr. Yuan Wenzhong, a reporter from Shen Bao, visited me at the College of Liberal Arts of Tongji University. I was already asleep at that time. I put on my clothes and opened the door, inviting the guest into the room. The guest told me that he had visited a newly discovered ancient tomb in the southern suburbs of Changzhou and brought back a tomb brick from this tomb. He wanted me to assess the age of this ancient tomb based on this brick. I had already seen the news about the discovery of the ancient tomb in Changzhou in the newspaper two days ago. Director Yang Kuan of the Municipal Museum and Professor Mou Runsun of Tongji University both intended to invite me to investigate it together. Because the students had missed too many classes last semester, I was reluctant to further delay their class time, so I hesitated for a while and did not go immediately. Now that the reporter has delivered the materials to my door, I am of course very willing to examine them carefully.</p>
<p>Examination of Tomb Brick</p>
<p>This brick is rectangular: 38.9 cm long, 18.7 cm wide, and 6 cm thick; one side has patterns, and the other side and four sides have no patterns; one corner is slightly damaged.</p>
<p>The side with patterns has a design of banana leaf patterns paired with four large coins. The banana leaf pattern lacks the "main vein" in the leaf and has a hint of superimposed human figure patterns. The circles of the large coins are not very accurate, with the longest diameter being 6 cm and the shortest diameter being 5.7 cm. There are four characters on the large coins, which are very blurry. This is because the tomb brick absorbed too much water in the soil, the brick is soft, and it was washed immediately after being unearthed, causing this phenomenon. The little trace seen in the blur is that the pattern on the brick surface was made by repeatedly applying a model that is only a quarter of the size of the brick surface for four days in a row, so the four large coins on this brick are identical. After I and Mr. Zhang Ziqi of the Municipal Museum gathered together and compared the four large coins, the clearest of the four characters is a "five" on the side. On the opposite side of the "five" is vaguely a "hundred". Vaguely, there is a "big" character above, and below is vaguely a "spring" character; the calligraphy of the four characters is between seal script and official script, with the "big" character being particularly blurred.</p>
<p>Great Spring Five Hundred</p>
<p>If our view is correct, then what is written on the brick should be the coin pattern of "Great Spring Five Hundred." According to research, "Great Spring Five Hundred" was the currency created by Emperor Wu of Wu in the fifth year of Jiahe. Since the tomb brick has the coin pattern of "Great Spring Five Hundred," then the earliest year it was built cannot exceed the fifth year of Jiahe of Sun Wu.</p>
<p>Let us ask when this ancient tomb may have been built at the latest? According to research, although the large coin Five Hundred was cast in the fifth year of Jiahe of Sun Wu, its use as an ornament on tomb bricks could be extended to the Western Jin Dynasty. The Jianxing Three Years brick recorded in the Qianduting Ancient Brick Illustrated Interpretation, volume ten, page seventeen, is an example of a Western Jin Dynasty tomb brick with "Great Spring Five Hundred" as an ornament. Furthermore, regarding banana leaf patterns, their use as decoration on tomb brick surfaces can also be extended to the Western Jin Dynasty. The Yongxing brick recorded in the Qianduting Ancient Brick Illustrated Interpretation, volume nine, page nine, is an example of a Western Jin Dynasty tomb brick with banana leaf patterns and coin patterns as brick surface decoration. By the Eastern Jin Dynasty, not only were tomb bricks with "Great Spring Five Hundred" as decoration and tombstone brick surfaces with banana leaf patterns as decoration rare; but also the form of tomb bricks gradually became smaller, different from this tomb brick's still retaining a bit of the large Han brick typical. Therefore, in my personal opinion, the latest era in which this ancient tomb was built may not be later than the Western Jin Dynasty.</p>
<p>After I told the guest my opinion, I also asked the guest to donate the brick to the Shanghai Municipal Museum. On the 22nd, Mr. Wang Tianmu of the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum came to the museum, and everyone carefully examined the brick again; and we used a wooden basin to hold water and soaked the brick in the water to make the patterns on the brick surface appear more clearly. As a result of this careful examination, everyone felt that saying that the coin pattern above was "Great Spring Five Hundred" was still very accurate. However, I always felt that I should find a tomb brick with a clearer coin pattern to look at to feel at ease, so on the 23rd, when I had no classes at school, I went to Changzhou again with Director Yang of the museum.</p>
<h3>Strange Young Man with a Big Background: Wu Zhihui's Great-Nephew</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Wujin Report, 29th] The former city defense department arrested Yu Chongguang, a young traveler at the Central Hotel, who had been staying at the inn for half a month, was usually extravagant, had unclear whereabouts, and carried weapons, at the Yingbin Hotel casino. After several interrogations, it was learned that he was the great-nephew of Party-State elder Wu Zhihui, only seventeen years old, originally studying at Provincial Chang Middle School, but was romantic by nature and did not restrain himself. In early February, he went to Taiwan with his mother to avoid the chaos. Within a few days, he stole three gold bars, totaling 26 taels, from his mother, took a boat back to Shanghai, and squandered twenty taels at Shanghai song and dance halls. He then came to Changzhou and stayed at the inn. As for the pistol, it was borrowed from his relative and classmate Wu Xinggen. The original owner of the gun was the police chief Zhang Huanrong, who lent it to the former social section chief Gao Chuan. After Gao left office, he hastily went to Guangdong and did not return it, so it was left with the intelligence officer Wu Xinggen. Yu was very familiar with Wu, so he secretly took it out and wore it on his body, intending to show off. Once the facts were clear, the city defense department notified Yu's relative, Senator Wu Pingzhai, to post bail for him. The whole case was quite dramatic and interesting. Rich young men are accustomed to being frivolous, and public opinion is all saddened.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Interpretation; Inheritance and Debt Issues Between Direct Blood Relatives</h3>
<p>Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi</p>
<p>Li Fufu asks: Editor, (1) My friend Mr. Wang's family is ordinary. He has two brothers, each establishing their own family and career. After their father's death, the meager inheritance will be divided equally between the two, inherited by the two brothers. The elder brother temporarily gave his share of the inheritance, two mu of land, to his mother to cultivate, to subsidize her living expenses, while the younger brother did not provide any support. Now, his mother does not work and likes to gamble. Although she has been repeatedly dissuaded, she has accumulated a lot of debt. If his mother disregards the livelihood of the two brothers, does she have the right to sell the property? (2) His mother is addicted to gambling, resulting in a lot of debt. Can the two brothers publish a statement in the newspaper to sever their mother-son relationship in order to prevent bankruptcy?</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) The inheritance should originally be jointly inherited by the spouse and lineal descendants. Therefore, dividing it into two shares and only receiving it by the two sons is not in accordance with the law. However, his mother's disposal of the land is also not something that she can decide alone. (2) There is no reason to sever the mother-son relationship, but if his mother has more debts than credits (or assets) after her death, then her sons (i.e., the heirs) can invoke the limited inheritance clause and use all assets to repay the debts. In fact, it is equivalent to declaring the bankruptcy of the deceased. Lenders should pay attention to the solvency of the debtors, otherwise they take risks and suffer losses themselves.</p>

<h3>Bank Branches to Open Silver Dollar Deposits; Decision Awaits Finance Minister Liu's Return to Shanghai; Silver and Money Trades Believe Technical Considerations Still Needed</h3>
<p>[China Economic News Agency] Regarding the financial sector's proposal to the Ministry of Finance to establish "Gold Deposits," "Silver Dollar Deposits," and "Commodity Price Index Deposits," the Ministry of Finance is considering accepting them. Yesterday, according to reporters, the "Silver Dollar Deposit" item has been ordered by the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance to draft a "Measures for Converting Gold Yuan into Silver Dollar Deposits," which is currently under review by the Secretariat of the Ministry of Finance. The content of the measures stipulates that people can convert gold yuan into deposits at banks at the current market price, and banks will pay silver dollars at the current market price when they are withdrawn in the future. Loans will all be converted from gold yuan to silver dollars, but calculated in gold yuan. These measures will be finalized after Finance Minister Liu Gongyun returns to Shanghai from Beijing, and it is expected to be implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>[China Economic News Agency] Minister of Finance and Governor of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun has completed his official duties in Beijing and is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Beijing today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The news that the financial authorities intend to mobilize various banks and branches to establish silver dollar deposits is rampant. Yesterday, reporters consulted various related parties on the possibility of establishing them, but the response was not very good. Here, we will analyze the two types of deposit methods. (1) Deposits and withdrawals are all in gold yuan, that is, the gold yuan deposited is converted into silver dollars at the current rate and recorded in the account. When withdrawing, it is converted back into gold yuan at the current rate. The silver and money trades believe that this method only adds unnecessary trouble to the business. The silver dollar fluctuates constantly, and the silver and money trades feel overwhelmed. Unless the Central Bank can accept the re-deposit of silver dollars, the silver and money trades will find it difficult to accept these deposits. From the customer's point of view, this type of deposit is not unlike the past gold deposits. To avoid repeating the same mistakes, even if it is opened, the deposits may not be large. (2) Deposits and withdrawals are all in silver dollars. Although the silver and money trades do not have the trouble of conversion, after receiving silver dollar deposits, the silver and money trades cannot lend in silver dollars because no one would be willing to accept silver dollar loans. Since the funds attracted cannot be released, the silver and money trades will be unwilling to accept this new business. Therefore, according to observation, if the financial authorities do not have sufficient encouragement for silver dollar deposits, it may be difficult to obtain enthusiastic support.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Opens at Limit Up, Declines Step by Step in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the trend of the gold market was uncertain, with rapid advances and retreats. In the morning, because the Central Bank still did not sell, favorable news spread everywhere, and people continued to be optimistic. Opening trading could not be done. The price was called up to the limit of 828,000, with demand exceeding supply. There was still no formal transaction until noon. In the afternoon, due to the high underground interest rate of about one yuan, and under the tight money situation, people's minds were weak, and retail investors came out one after another, opening at 833,000. In the middle of the day, under the influence of selling pressure from bank-affiliated gold dealers, the market fell all the way, retreating to 800,000 at closing. The clearing price among colleagues was not listed in the morning, and it was listed at 806,000 in the afternoon, an increase of 47,000 compared to before the holiday. The combined interest for two days was only about 65 yuan, which was actually a rise in name but a fall in reality.</p>
<p>Off-Exchange</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Off-exchange trading was strong. The morning opened at 855,000. Guangdong and Shanxi dealers searched vigorously, and securities dealers also made arbitrage purchases, pushing the price all the way to 878,000 and 883,000. Near noon, bank-affiliated dealers frequently sold, dropping directly to 838,000 and 843,000 at closing. Afternoon trading was light and declining, from 825,000 and 830,000, all the way down to 800,008 and 811,000, a decrease of 42,000 compared to before the holiday. The overnight interest rate was increased by 65,000 per tael, making the high to 873,000 and 877,000.</p>
<p>US Dollars</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] There were not many US dollar transactions, and foreign firm dealers and bank dealers were still actively trading. The morning opened at 17,000 and 17,500, rising to 18,000 and 18,500. The noon closing fell to 16,700 and 17,200. The afternoon opening was 16,500 and 17,000, and the closing fell to 16,100 and 16,400, a decrease of 900 compared to before the holiday. The overnight interest rate was increased by 1,300, making the high to 17,400 and 17,700.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, gold jewelry sales in jewelry stores were strong, and prices were firm. The morning listed the price up to 830,000 and 900,000. In the afternoon, it rose again to 840,000 and 920,000. The buying and selling prices were lengthened by another 10,000, with a difference of up to 80,000, an increase of 30,000 compared to before the holiday.

Money exchange businesses listed the price of pure copper coins at 850,000 and 880,000 in the morning, and down to 830,000 and 860,000 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Silver Dollars</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the silver dollar market was firm. Due to silver dollar arbitrage transactions, several trading firms in the city had generally opened in the morning. Yesterday, about 1.8 million silver dollars were arbitraged, and buying and selling were busy. The telephone arbitrage transaction, same-day check, high for big heads reached 14,000 and 15,000, which was invisibly 17% higher than cash transactions. Street trading was active because it was the end of the month today and various industries were distributing salaries. Holders strongly supported the price, calling the big head 10,500 and 10,800 in the morning, all the way up to 12,000 and 13,000. The afternoon once fell to 11,500 and 12,500, and in the evening, it lingered between 12,000 and 13,000. Small heads were called 10,000 and 11,000, and Eagle and Dragon dollars were called 8,000 and 9,000, an increase of about 15% compared to before the holiday.</p>
<h3>Short Squeeze Unleashed in the Market, Chinese Stocks Forced to Decline</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market was initially firm yesterday, but later, major players felt that the money market was tightening. Textile and construction companies sold off large quantities of yarn, and the Central Bank secretly sold gold. Cotton yarn dealers, securities dealers, and gold dealers all sold off, unleashing a short squeeze in the market. Selling pressure was strong, and the market was forced to decline. Yong Yarn opened at 9 yuan and 95 cents in the morning. After the opening, hearing that gold had reached the limit up, people were quite optimistic. Buyers came out and pushed the price all the way up to 10 yuan and 9 cents. Later, various dealers sold vigorously, seeing a low of 10 yuan and 55 cents. Spot buyers came in to cover their positions, and the price rose again to 10 yuan and 78 cents. Near noon, due to the tightening of the money market and strong short selling pressure, the price closed low at 10 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks all opened high in the morning. Near closing, due to Yong Yarn's short squeeze, all stocks were dragged down. Meiya opened and saw 3 yuan and 34 cents again, reaching the limit up twice. Xinguang opened and turned to close flat. Jingfu followed the same trend. Xinhuo, Qinxing, and Jinglun all returned after rising. Only Neiyi reached the limit up. Zhenhua reached the limit down, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the money market suddenly tightened, and the underground interest rate was high at 1 yuan and 20 cents. Off-exchange gold reported a decline, and the bulls were overwhelmed. The market weakened again. Yong Yarn initially opened at 10 yuan and 25 cents, falling all the way to 9 yuan and 75 cents. Later, it gradually declined, with the lowest at 9 yuan and 15 cents. Near closing, it rebounded slightly, closing at 9 yuan and 25 cents. The rest were all lower than the morning closing. The volume traded was 5.00902 billion shares.</p>
<p>The foreign stock market saw a tightening of the money market yesterday, and people became tired. Floating retail investors started selling, and the market immediately retreated. Yisha made 24,000 yuan and 25,000 yuan, a drop of 1,000 yuan. British Union made 27,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 4,000 yuan. Yip Beer made 4,850 yuan and 5,150 yuan, a small drop of 300 yuan. Jardine Matheson made 85,000 yuan and 86,000 yuan, a drop of 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Gold public bonds opened at 515,000 yuan in the morning, rising all the way to 550,000. Later, due to the tightening of the money market and a slight return of gold after rising, the market followed softly. The noon closing was still 510,000. There were no transactions in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Money Loosens, Production Prices Rise, Rice Rises Across the Board, Flour Initially Firm then Weak, Edible Oil Slightly Shows</h3>
<p>Rice prices rose again yesterday due to loose money and rising prices in the production area. In the middle of the day, the price of gold was reported to be rising, so the increase was quite strong. The price of white japonica rice and thin paddy rice in the North City market generally rose by 3,000 yuan. Special japonica rice was 89,000 yuan, already approaching the 90,000 mark. In the South Rice market, door sales of white japonica rice heavily knocked on the 90,000 yuan mark. The arrival of goods in the two cities was 5,271 stones.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The rising trend has slowed down slightly because prices have risen excessively in recent days. Owners are seeking to sell at high prices, and factories have also started production, increasing supply. The price is weak to rise. Soybean oil reached a maximum of 540,000, and the closing price was 520,000, a slight increase of 10,000 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil rose slightly by 20,000, while raw oil fell by 20,000. Jiangbei Jishui raw oil was 580,000, and the price of soybean cake was stable.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Initially firm then weak. The market opened with a surge in various off-exchange commodities, and the money market was relatively stable. Owners reported very strongly. Houchuan initially made a high of 33,000 yuan. Later, the money market tightened, the stock market retreated sharply, and Yong Yarn fell into the tenth level. People's minds were weak, and the market moved step by step downstream, with the last transaction at 32,250 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The market saw a decline in the later stages due to tight funds. Soybeans fell by 35,000 yuan. Car beans made 15,000 yuan. Peanut hoarders came out, and the market supply exceeded demand. Prices were slightly weak. Corn and sorghum closed earlier, and the market saw a slight rise.</p>
<h3>North-South Remittance Business Temporarily Suspended from Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Xinhua Bank, banks designated to handle North-South remittances have temporarily suspended remittances to the North from yesterday. Since the opening of North-South remittances, there have been many remittances from the South to the North, but few remittances from the North to the South. The designated remittance banks themselves cannot balance their positions and have to temporarily suspend remittances. After more remittances come from the North, the North-South can be handled as usual.</p>
<h3>Central Bank to Issue Six Types of Large Bills</h3>
<p>[Commodity Research Institute] The Central Bank will announce the issuance of the following types of banknotes from the 4th of next month, namely 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000, and 1 million yuan banknotes. This measure should alleviate the banknote shortage in various places. Also, our reporter recently asked a certain authority of the Central Bank here when the banknote shortage can be eliminated. According to him, it will definitely be eliminated on the 5th of next month.</p>
<h3>Money Market Changes from Loose to Tight</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money market changed from loose to tight. The morning opening day interest rate was still between 60 and 70 yuan. Soon, as the end of the month approached, various sectors were short of funds. The day interest rate gradually increased. It was also heard that the National Bank was selling gold in large quantities, and it was rumored that a certain bank was unstable due to a large short position. In the afternoon, the money market suddenly tightened, and the day interest rate once broke through the 100 yuan mark. Finally, it was around 80 or 90 yuan, but there were still many borrowers searching everywhere to make up for the shortage. The trend was quite tight.</p>
<p>Also, the tight cash situation yesterday did not improve because Fang Zhi was after the holiday. The discount rate was mostly as high as 10% or more. Bills were prevalent. The bill exchange center was extended until about 8 p.m. before the exchange was completed. The number of exchanged bills was more than 910,000, and the amount reached more than 410 billion yuan. Government banks had a net outflow of 700 million yesterday, foreign merchant banks had a net inflow of 2.3 billion, large exchanges had a net inflow of 4.9 billion, and small exchanges had a net outflow of 6.5 billion.</p>
<h3>Cash Withdrawal Limit for Banks and Branches Relaxed by National Bank Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's cash withdrawal limit for banks and money shops has been relaxed to 18% of the overnight deposit balance, of which 20% is issued in National Bank promissory notes and 80% is issued in cash. However, as a result, due to signature issues, the number of promissory notes issued was less than 20%. As a result of yesterday's relaxation of the limit, promissory notes were issued about 350 million yuan, and cash was issued about 5.8 billion yuan (of which banks and money shops accounted for about 3.36 billion yuan).</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Rises and Falls Intermittently, Cloth Market Reaches New High</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn initially rose then softened because Monday's surge was too severe and the money market was tight. People were thinking of risks at high prices. As a result, the increases were more than the decreases compared to before the holiday.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened at 1.35 million yuan. By the end of the day, because of direct sales, buyers were watching, and the rising trend finally failed to continue. It retreated to 6 million yuan at closing, a decrease of 220,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon fell from 4.25 million yuan all the way to 3.97 million yuan at the end, finally rising by 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 3.29 million yuan. Soon, it was heard that gold and securities had reached the limit up, and the price was pushed up to 3.32 million yuan. Near noon, the money market tightened and people's minds turned empty. Finally, it stood at the 3 million mark, a decrease of 50,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse initially made 3.15 million yuan, and just as it fell into the pass, it retreated to 2.82 million yuan at closing, also a decrease of 50,000 yuan. Other grades varied. 16-count and below all saw a slight rise.</p>
<p>The cloth market continued to rise sharply. In the early morning, hearing that gold had reached the limit up, people were excited. Local customers sucked up successively, and scattered households pulled up successively. Under the atmosphere of buying, all cloths reached new highs.</p>
<p>Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 122,000 yuan. Just as it reached 139,000 yuan, many short-term holders made profits and sold. The price fell back to 132,500 yuan at closing, a sharp increase of 21,000 yuan compared to before the holiday. Five Happiness fine cloth also surged by 21,000 yuan. In addition, low-end fine cloths all opened outside the 100,000 mark.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen's Yuan Serge initially made 108,000 yuan, once knocking on the 120,000 mark. Before closing, it relaxed back to 106,500 yuan, finally reaching 116,500 yuan, a decrease of 9,300 yuan. After closing, it once made a small amount of 103,500 yuan. 190 high-end Shilin Factory opened at 270,000 yuan. The remaining cloths rose across the board. The market is opening the post-market for the Tiger brand. If it proceeds smoothly, it may be implemented at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Market Ramblings</h3>
<p>— Onlooker's Stand</p>
<p>Don't Underestimate the Buying and Selling of Silver Dollars; Someone Is Squeezing Blood from Employees</p>
<p>The way employees arrange their salaries is to buy silver dollars. They are just preserving the value of the currency and maintaining their livelihood, not seeking profit.</p>
<p>Salaries are paid in the middle and at the end of the month, which has become a common practice. Therefore, there is usually a rising trend for silver dollars in the morning during the week starting on the 1st and 16th of each month.</p>
<p>Someone is squeezing blood from the employees!</p>
<p>They buy silver dollars successively in the week before the middle of the month and the week before the end of the month, taking advantage of the price not having risen yet. Then, in the week after the middle of the month and the week after the end of the month, they sell silver dollars successively at high prices.</p>
<p>After they sell the silver dollars, they put them out for a week of interest, and then it's the week before the middle of the month and the week before the end of the month again. So, they recover the interest and then go to buy silver dollars successively, waiting until the week after the middle of the month and the week after the end of the month to sell silver dollars and put them out for interest.</p>
<p>Repeating this cycle, they get fat off the blood of the employees.</p>
<p>How cruel this is! However, the current so-called business economics is originally "man eats man," and it cannot be blamed on them alone.</p>
<p>There is a cash shortage everywhere, and it is becoming more and more serious.</p>
<p>However, in the hands of silver dollar dealers on Sichuan Road, Henan Road, and throughout the city, there are stacks of brand new cash, increasing every day, and there is no shortage.</p>
<p>Where does their new cash come from? Everyone is wondering.</p>
<p>A Hong Kong newspaper's "Shanghai Correspondence" has the following record: People in uniform dispersed pedestrians on the road and handed several sacks of new banknotes to a small money shop on Sichuan Road, receiving a large number of silver dollars. Then, more than a dozen silver dollar dealer leaders received large amounts of cash from this small money shop and distributed them to silver dollar dealers on the street, and then recovered silver dollars from the silver dollar dealers.</p>
<p>Where does the cash in the silver dollar dealer silver dollar market come from? Well, it comes from this way.</p>
<p>Believe it or not.</p>
<p>The Central Bank not only does not think of ways to eliminate the discount on bills, but the recent issuance of fixed-amount promissory notes and other behaviors are expanding the trend of bill discounting.</p>
<p>The tightness of cash in the past two days is becoming increasingly severe, so the trend of discounting is also becoming increasingly severe.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned Hong Kong newspaper's "Shanghai Correspondence," the following things were reported:</p>
<p>Friends in uniform, carrying sacks full of new cash, bought silver dollars, and also bought promissory notes and checks, in certain small money shops such as Sichuan Road. It is said that they paid cash at 90% of the face value for the bills they received. That is to say, they paid 9,000 yuan in new cash for a 10,000 yuan bill. In this way, it can be known that when silver dollar dealers receive a 10,000 yuan bill, they actually only earn 1,000 yuan in discounts, and another 1,000 yuan in discounts is collected on behalf of friends in uniform.</p>
<p>Those who are doing the business of discounting bills are not limited to the silver dollar market. There are also many underground money shops, and even employees of some public banks, who are also participating.</p>
<p>These institutions and figures who are doing the business of discounting bills are strange. They can all pay out large stacks of new banknotes with a face value of 500 or 1,000 yuan. They can handle any large bill discount.</p>
<p>Where does their new cash come from?</p>
<p>Besides the issuing agency, no one can supply new cash so sufficiently.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot assume that the Central Bank refuses to issue cash to merchants and reserves it for buying silver dollars.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot think that the Central Bank refuses to issue new cash to merchants in order to earn a 1,000 yuan discount in the underground money shop market.</p>
<p>However, we cannot confirm that this new cash in the silver dollar market and bill discount market is not directly supplied by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>We only know that all cash is issued by the Central Bank. Only the Central Bank can supply all new cash.</p>
<p>New Finance Minister Liu Gongyun is also the new Governor of the Central Bank. Mr. Liu is a financial expert and is trusted by the central government. We hope that he will take action to thoroughly investigate and quickly eliminate the cash shortage and eliminate the crime of discounting!</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Circle</h3>
<p>— Mei Jie</p>
<p>On the Xinghua Team with a Good Roster</p>
<p>If we use the Xinghua team's personnel to deploy a lineup as follows:</p>
<p>Forwards: Zhang Xiuli, Wang Zhelun, Wang Huiling, Wang Shan, Qian Mengyue</p>
<p>Guards: Zhu Lanzhen, Huang Ruyu, Wang Shan, Zhu Jiazhen, Wu Zhaorui</p>
<p>Any qualified fan who sees the above lineup will certainly - everyone will think of their results. Aren't they able to steadily defeat the Li team and threaten the Green team? Even in the middle school cup, Minli can also defeat Qixiu. Xinghua has the soldiers of Minli and also has city representatives such as Wang Shan, Wu Zhaorui, Zhang Xiuli, and Wang Huiling. It should be better than Minli, and the Li team is the backbone of Qixiu. Based on this, Xinghua seems to be so uncompetitive in this league. The previous evening, Luo Yuehan only played half a game. Although it is said to be Yuehan's hard work, it also shows the decline of Xinghua.</p>
<p>The good or bad of everything is naturally not without factors. The reason why Xinghua has such good talents but the results are not ideal, in the author's observation, should have the following two problems.</p>
<p>(1) Management is not effective - Perhaps many people will not believe this. Everyone in the circle knows that the backstage manager of the Xinghua team is our old friend Qiu Hongkang, and the person fully responsible for external management is Qu Xirong, the secretary-general of the basketball committee. Qiu was previously the manager of the front-line women's team. He has rich experience and a sensitive mind, and Qu is a figure of the authorities, which is even more valuable. Then, why is it said that management is not effective? Hongkang has been busy with other things recently and does not pay much attention to it. Qu has a lot of heroic abilities, but lacks delicate ideals, so there are shortcomings of excess and deficiency. The so-called excess is that the estimate of the players' ball skills is too high. The so-called insufficiency is that they cannot be urged to do substantial training. Therefore, in terms of management, if Qiu and Qu cooperate fully in the future, a wise and courageous mixed effort will still have hope in the Mayor's Cup.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of training opportunities - Xinghua's performance in this session is completely trapped in the individual performances of a star-type idol system. There are good talents but no good performances. This is based on this. My criticism must be the lack of opportunities to practice together. Therefore, in the recent tactics, there are only personal skills, no team cooperation, no way to attack, and no full defense. Naturally, it can only be inferior and fail to exert its personal advantages. This is very regrettable.</p>
<p>Xinghua has this problem in this session, so she is frustrated. If she can improve, she should have high hopes. For example, each of the players in their team has special advantages. Let's see:</p>
<p>Wang Huiling - has height, speed, is lively and can shoot, a good center forward. However, she did not play in this session due to heavy schoolwork, which is also a major regret for Xinghua.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiuli - can rush and is energetic, extremely brave, and has excellent corner shooting skills. Unfortunately, she has been away from this for a long time, and it is inevitable that her color will be reduced.</p>
<p>Qian Mengyue - has a strange style of shooting, and it looks like she can move it at will, but nine times out of ten she hits. She is a strange talent the previous evening, but she suffers from short-sightedness and is slightly at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Wang Zhelun - interception skills, not letting the beard and eyebrows, is more aggressive than spicy, and shooting has not yet reached perfection.</p>
<p>Wang Shan - has a slender figure, is light and good at jumping, can be a forward or a guard, and is good at follow-up work, a female basketball all-rounder.</p>
<p>Huang Ruyu - sees people extremely tightly, has a good position, and also has thresholds for blocking. She is shorter in stature and prone to fouls.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiazhen - has a healthy physique, superhuman height, and should be more convenient to get the ball. She seems to be able to beat others as a defender, but her movements are slightly slower.</p>
<p>Zhu Lanzhan - pinning people is so tight that those who are hit will be devastated. The disadvantage is that they are prone to fouls.</p>
<p>Wu Zhaorui - has a clear mind, and has a way to grab the ball and block people. She is also good at avoiding people dribbling.</p>
<p>Here - what I want to list is that several of Xinghua are very good in sportsmanship. Then, it is regrettable that they abandoned the game against the Green team for no reason in this session. I hope to be able to reform myself. I don't know if the team will participate in the Mayor's Cup? If you participate, then review my words and work hard, I think there will definitely be amazing results and good performances to please the fans.</p>
<h3>Renyu and Haiqing Fight for Second Place: The Basketball League's First Division Nears Conclusion</h3>
<p>The basketball league originally had three First Division matches scheduled today, but the highly anticipated second-round game between Hua Lian and the Shanghai Police team was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances, leaving only two matches. The games will be held at the City Gymnasium starting at 5:30 PM, with ticket prices at 500 yuan for the balcony, 1000 yuan for the ground floor, and 1500 yuan for reserved seating. The schedule and game times are as follows:</p>
<p>Ping Ping – Pang Team (Second Division C) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Renyu – Haiqing (First Division Makeup Game) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>The first match features Ping Ping versus Pang Team in the Second Division C group. The two teams are evenly matched, and their skills are both at a high level. Pang Team boasts veterans like Liu Ben, Dong Yangfeng, and Zhang Buqing, who have extensive experience but may lack endurance. Although Ping Ping is a newcomer, they defeated Taer in their group, demonstrating their strength. Xia Zhiong and Rao Yurong are young and energetic, and Wang Weijun's shooting skills are particularly excellent. They are evenly matched with Pang Team, so their competition should be quite exciting.</p>
<p>The second game is a First Division match between Renyu and Haiqing. This is a makeup game from the first round. Renyu's record in this tournament is second only to Hua Lian. Although the Shanghai Police team is close behind, they only have one game left against the Shanghai Police team besides tonight's game. If Renyu wins tonight against Haiqing, they can be assured of second place. They will undoubtedly give their all in this crucial game. Renyu is in excellent form, making their chances of winning high. Haiqing will be represented tonight by the Qierdun ship. Qierdun previously played for Haiqing against Mailing in the second-round league match, losing 20-41. This was partly due to unfamiliarity with the court lighting. Hopefully, their performance will be better tonight. The lineups for the four teams are listed below:</p>
<p>(Ping Ping) Wang Weijun, Xia Zhiong, Wang Yaoxiang, Chen Ronglin, Song Lianxiang, Sun Xuewen, Zhao Xieming, Li Yongji, Rao Yurong.</p>
<p>(Pang Team) Sun Mingxin, Liu Benqin, Dong Yangfeng, He Xiaoguang, Chen Beiting, Zhang Shaoqing, Song Qihou, Ji Youkun, Ling Peng.</p>
<p>(Renyu) Wu Xinyun, Yao Wenyi, Zhuang Yirong, Shen Pengju, Li Zhaohe, Wang Huaiding, Cai Jindian, Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongyi, Yan Bin.</p>
<p>(Haiqing) Saipula, Bolang, Piweiqu, Su Pei, Habotuo, Yalu, Smith, Saimu, Shibanen, Tang Musi, Datuman.</p>
<p>The First Division schedule has entered its decisive stage. Three teams, Huili, Mailing, and Peifeier, have already finished their matches. Hua Lian has only lost once in twelve games, securing the championship. Renyu is in second place with eight wins and four losses. If they win against Haiqing tonight, they will secure second place. The Shanghai Police team has six wins and five losses, with three games remaining. If they win all three, they could tie with Renyu for second place. The third position is more uncertain. The current standings of the First Division are listed below:</p>
<p>Team Name  Matches  Wins  Losses  Percentage</p>
<p>Hua Lian   12   11   1   901</p>
<p>Renyu   12   8   4   666</p>
<p>Huili   14   8   6   571</p>
<p>Shanghai Police 11   6   5   545</p>
<p>Enkas  12   6   6   500</p>
<p>Mailing  14   5   9   357</p>
<p>Peifeier  14   4   10   285</p>
<p>Haiqing  11   3   8   272</p>

<h3>Pan Team Wins by One Goal Against Huaguang: Democratic Cup Tournament Championship Game Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Pan Team and Huaguang played in the Democratic Cup yesterday in Nanshi. Huaguang's strength was affected by the absence of Wu Qixiang, but they still maintained an offensive throughout the game. Unfortunately, their shots were inaccurate, and they did not score. Near the end of the first half, Pan Team's Situ Yuan scored a goal, which ultimately determined the outcome. Pan Team showed great fighting spirit and was able to defeat Huaguang 1-0, which was not entirely unexpected.</p>
<p>Tomorrow at 4:00 PM, the championship team will face Daxia, the champion of the intermediate group. The referee will be Ma Youyu, and the linesmen will be Qu Rusong and Zang Wenbin. The starting lineups for Pan Team and Huaguang yesterday were as follows:</p>

<h3>Table Tennis Tips</h3>
<p>— Written by Wang Xinjing, Revised by Chen Linsheng (2)</p>
<p>(4) What are the Benefits for Us?</p>
<p>It can strengthen the body: "A sound mind in a sound body." "Where there is life, there is hope." We have never seen a sick person accomplish something extraordinary. If you have great ambitions, but your body cannot withstand a breeze or the sun, then I worry about your future. I may see you as someone different from the average person. The health of our bodies and our future are closely linked. I don't want to say too much, but we can confidently say that "any divine calling, big or small, requires a healthy person to carry it out." If we want to spend our time "from birth to death" meaningfully, then we feel the importance of strengthening our bodies.</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers have especially developed legs, blacksmiths have especially developed hands, and thinkers have unusually complex brains... The more you use something, the more it develops. Some sports cause the body to develop abnormally, but table tennis is an average full-body exercise. Not only is the full-body exercise average, but it also requires "mental agility", so it is also a hand-brain coordination exercise.</p>
<p>I am not saying that table tennis is the only way to strengthen the body, but I dare say that table tennis can strengthen the body. We know that Shaolin Kung Fu can strengthen the body, and Tai Chi can also strengthen the body. Bird's nest and tremella are said to nourish the body, but we believe that vegetables and light meals are more beneficial to the body. Table tennis is a gentle exercise, comparable to Tai Chi in national sports, and comparable to vegetables and light meals in diet. "Some people are a hundred years old as children, and some people are three years old as old men." Let's all try to be "hundred-year-old children".</p>
<p>I have already briefly discussed the environment of table tennis, regardless of time, place, or people. Here, I want to talk about what benefits it brings to us. I think it has several obvious points for us:</p>
<p>Cultivating Noble Character: We should take some time to rest when we are extremely busy; and we should often find things to do when we are free. This is the psychology of most people. In our free time, we can do good things or bad things. But according to common sense, the "crane" standing out from the "chickens" is, after all, in the minority. Most people are "chickens" that "go with the flow". So we only hear the "crackling" sound of sparrow battles, only hear drinking and guessing games, only hear talk of adultery, theft, and bandits, and rarely hear about studying proper issues... From these "common" things, we can see that most people do not know how to use their leisure time and do not have proper entertainment. This is such a dangerous thing!</p>
<p>"It's easy to learn bad habits, but difficult to change for the better." We should not learn bad habits before we learn them; and we should "practice upwards" while not learning bad habits. If you play table tennis whenever you are free, you can easily isolate yourself from most bad habits and maintain your original innocence. For the sake of the nobility of table tennis, we cultivate our excellent character. Once the habit of playing table tennis is formed, picking up a racket when the body is uncomfortable is like a drinking buddy having a big drink, and the joy is endless. Its ability to entertain body and mind is a topic for another article.</p>
<p>Increasing Work Efficiency: People of the same level, in the same environment, handling the same things, will definitely get different results. This is due to interest. With good interest, one's thinking will naturally be precise, and one's skills will naturally be agile. After doing something successful, interest is better, and external things that are enough to attract our attention can often generate interest. Whether interest is good or not, we can say that it is due to the heart in seven out of ten cases, and due to external feelings in three out of ten cases.</p>

<h3>A Record of Meddling</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>I often like to meddle in other people's business, and many experienced elders think this is inappropriate. However, there is one thing that, in the eyes of someone who likes to meddle, is quite "satisfying".</p>
<p>Last month, I saw a high-class beggar using the latest scientific method to ask for money. First, let me tell you about this person's appearance: thin face, medium-sized body, buzz cut, no unsightly whiskers on his face, very clean, wearing a gray-white cloth gown, and wearing a pair of slightly shiny yellow leather shoes. He was sitting on a blanket, with his gown pulled up, revealing half of his left leg covered in cloth, folded under his right leg. His right leg was straight, so others could see that his right leg was healthy, but his left leg had a problem and he couldn't walk. A baby was sleeping on his chest, and a two- or three-year-old child, who was not very steady on his feet, was standing to his left. The child's hair was brushed with hair oil and styled in the Western fashion, but his limbs were pitifully weak. Many people were watching, and this noble beggar said to himself, "My leg is paralyzed, I can't do anything, and the child's mother is also sick." He meant that he was unemployed, but he originally had the ability to work, but because one of his legs became disabled, it affected his future. His wife is sick, which is also indirectly affected by unemployment. Plus, there is no one to take care of the child, so he has to beg shamelessly. Isn't this kind of suffering enough to arouse sympathy?</p>
<p>If it were really genuine, no one would bother to care. However, this kind of person's family was originally not bad, as you can tell from his clothes and the child's attire. It is truly miserable to fall to this point, so bystanders are willing to give him money. The cloth gown he is wearing is worth at least twenty or thirty thousand, so bystanders will definitely not give him ten or fifty yuan. You think, how can you be embarrassed to offer so little?</p>
<p>He held a lot of gold yuan bills in his hand and moved his butt forward. Every two or three steps he moved, he dragged the standing child forward. The child's heart was pure, so he opened his mouth and cried very miserably, even jumping up and down, as if he couldn't bear the strain. I followed them for quite a while, and when we reached a place with fewer people, I saw the noble beggar get into a rickshaw with the two children and disappear.</p>
<p>The second time I found this person near the Great World. His legs were straight, and a carrying pole was placed in front of him. In the bamboo baskets at each end, there was a dying child, and many people were giving him money.</p>
<p>The third time I saw him get out of a rickshaw with the two children, performing the same act as the first time I saw him. People who pitied his misfortune were again rewarding him.</p>
<p>I am extremely happy to see people willing to give alms to the poor, but for some reason, I felt disgusted by this beggar. I even hated his actions a little. I believe I was definitely not envious because I saw him holding a wad of banknotes. The reason I hated him was because I saw through his lies. He shouldn't deceive people, especially by using children. I don't think those children were his own flesh and blood, because the faces of the children I saw several times were different. He wouldn't have so many; and some of their ages seemed to differ by only a few months. Moreover, his expression towards the children showed no signs of pity. A question that could not be dispelled swirled in my mind: Where did these children come from? Were they simply discarded after they were dragged to death? Therefore, the third time I saw him, I told my doubts to a police officer. The police officer also found it strange, saying, "I met him on ×× Road just a quarter of an hour ago. How did he get here so quickly?" Then, the police officer stepped forward to question him, and he was visibly flustered. Apparently, he stumbled over his words, and the police officer angrily kicked him several times in the back, demanding that he stand up. At first, he still claimed to be paralyzed, willing to endure the pain. Later, the weight of the leather shoes finally cured his illness. He was actually able to stand up and go to the "police station" with the police officer.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened after that. But it is true that I have never encountered this noble beggar again. I hope that this rogue, who used ignorant children to swindle money, has indeed received the punishment he deserved.</p>
<h3>The Fox Grieves for the Dead Rabbit</h3>
<p>— Written by Yanfan</p>
<h3>Suggestions to the Central Bank</h3>
<p>— Weiming</p>
<p>I accidentally saw a Hong Kong cent bill. One side was printed with text, but the other side was completely blank.</p>
<p>Our country's finances are currently always in deficit when comparing income and expenditure. We use inflation to make up for it, and banknotes are constantly circulating in the market.</p>
<p>Now, I suggest that the Central Bank authorities might as well imitate the style of Hong Kong bills in the future banknotes they issue, only printing on one side and leaving the other side blank so they can put advertisements on it. Because banknotes circulate in a large area and are necessary for everyone, their effectiveness must also be very high. The companies and shops that advertise will definitely not suffer losses, and the Central Bank can also have a substantial income. I wonder what the Central Bank authorities think?</p>
<h3>Daydreaming Inventions</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>It is not very difficult for an inventor to obtain a patent certificate from the "U.S. Patent Office". All he has to do is fill out an application form in person or through a lawyer, pay a $30 processing fee, and then wait for the examination of his design and invention. Any "new" and "useful" art, machine, or manufacturing method, once patented, gives the inventor and his heirs "the patent right to manufacture, use, and sell" his invention for a period of seventeen years, valid in the United States and its territories.</p>
<p>However, the term "new and useful" is interpreted differently. Here, let me give a few examples of daydreaming inventions that the Patent Office actually approved. They are indeed new, but whether they are truly useful seems to be a big question.</p>
<p>A method to prevent train collisions: If two trains are approaching each other on the same track, using this new collision avoidance method, one train can drive onto a section of track and climb on top of the other. In this way, the two trains can still safely travel on their own paths.</p>
<p>A rocking chair with bellows to provide fresh air to the rocker.</p>
<p>A battleship with magnets installed all around to capture submarines.</p>
<p>A hat that automatically tips using levers, saving the energy of gentlemen who are courteous to women.</p>
<p>Glasses for chickens to prevent their eyes from being pecked by other chickens.</p>
<p>The most wonderful invention is a machine for catching tapeworms in the stomach. It is a doctor's masterpiece, shaped like a loaf, with a window opened in one end and a string attached to the other. Before use, the tapeworm in the patient's abdomen is starved for a long time. Then, the patient is told to swallow the machine. It is assumed that the hungry tapeworm in the stomach sees the bait in the bag through the window on the machine and will drill its head in, at which point the mechanism will catch the tapeworm. At this time, it is also assumed that the patient realizes something is happening in his stomach and quickly pulls the machine out like fishing, catching the tapeworm, and so on.</p>
<h3>Male Childbirth</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In theory, a pregnant woman who is about to give birth should enjoy better treatment and careful care. However, in some parts of the world, the opposite is true, and it is the man who is about to become a father but does not experience the pain of childbirth who is being cared for.</p>
<p>For example, in some parts of the Baltic Sea, in a family that is about to have a new baby, it is the husband who takes medicine and tonics, while the pregnant wife is completely ignored. After the baby is born from the mother's body, it is also the husband, not the wife, who nurses and raises the baby. This custom is called "male childcare."</p>
<p>In British Guiana, Indian women continue to work until a few hours before giving birth, while her husband can lie in bed and rest for several days before the new baby arrives. He eats specially nutritious food to ensure that his wife will give birth to a healthy baby. When the pregnant woman is about to give birth, she sneaks into the woods, while her husband lies in bed groaning as if he were really about to give birth. As soon as the fetus falls to the ground, the woman immediately rushes home to take care of her newborn baby, herself, and her husband—until he is fully "recovered" from childbirth.</p>
<h3>A Poetic Menu</h3>
<p>— Fei Yuanfan</p>
<p>Cantonese people are good at writing beautiful sentences on menus. For example, paper-wrapped chicken is titled "Phoenix Enters the Silk Tent," and bamboo shoots fried with chicken slices are titled "Phoenix Enters the Bamboo Forest," both of which are subtle and pleasing. Now, I have selected some common and delicious dishes, and following their intention, I have crowned them with poetic names and listed them in a menu below:</p>
<p>Crimson Strings and Jade Zithers: Shredded chicken with agaric.</p>
<p>Wind's Charm, Purple Roses: Fragrant mushrooms stir-fried with chicken slices.</p>
<p>Purple Ribbon, Silver Gauze: Jellyfish skin mixed with tofu skin.</p>
<p>Silver Foundation, Hanging Flowers: Seaweed and silver needle fish soup.</p>
<p>Golden Kings Filling the Hall: Golden needle vegetables braised with tofu.</p>
<p>Blue Fields, White Herons: Chives stir-fried with white rice shrimp.</p>
<p>Fragrant Jade's Tenderness: Stir-fried shrimp balls.</p>
<p>Lotus Fairy: Clams steamed with egg.</p>
<p>Golden Phoenix, Silver Goose: Chicken and duck casserole.</p>
<p>Birds Flying Wing to Wing: Braised chicken wings.</p>
<p>Spring Colors Filling the Garden: Winter melon soup.</p>
<p>Floral Moon Pavilion: Braised fermented bean curd pork.</p>
<p>Fragrant Rain and Jade Scraps: Toona sinensis mixed with tofu.</p>
<p>Pearls and Jade, Doubly Brilliant: Shrimp and tofu soup.</p>
<p>A Peck of Bright Pearls: Stir-fried shrimp.</p>
