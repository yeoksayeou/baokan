<h3>海空兩軍協助進擊　浦東戰事漸入高潮　三主要陣線國軍均進展</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕海軍總部息：我海軍第×艦隊（廿三日）晨猛烈出擊，協同陸軍截擊對高橋進攻匪軍，當將高橋左右翼重要據點陳家橋·楊家宅等地匪軍完全擊退，我陸軍正乘勢猛攻中。我海軍於協助陸軍對上述據點猛擊後，復對匪退路予以阻擊，此役我××艦陳慶堃艦長及××艦邱仲明艦長，均使用突擊戰術，於接近江岸極近距離，以最有效火力對匪作毀滅性射擊，匪以死傷慘重，乃沿上述據點敗退。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：廿三日全日上海浦東區激戰甚烈，午前因雲低天雨，大部艦之空軍活動殊受限制，午後雲高轉晴，卽以大批飛機飛臨浦東高橋·洋涇·塘橋之綫，協助陸軍出擊，頑強之匪勢卽為我壓制，迄晚我軍在以上三主要陣綫均已獲得預期之進展。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：（一）浦東高橋方面廿三日午十一時我出擊部隊連續攻克陳家蕩後，右翼復直趨印家橋·中宅·陸家宅·陳家蕩之綫，左翼刻仍與陳王三宅之匪激戰中。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕廿三日上午九時卅分軍息：（一）浦東地區戰事，經兩日來守軍之英勇反擊，以及我某某等部生力軍源源開赴前綫增援，逐漸進入高潮，廿三日晨一時許，我陸家渡，洋涇鎮以東之主陣地帶復展開猛烈戰鬥，犯匪約三千餘，竟冒熾盛火網，於黑夜中分路向我猛撲，激戰達三小時，匪傷亡數百，比及天明，殘匪卽全數投入我預設之袋形陣地以內，刻仍在我軍包圍聚殲中。（二）高橋之役，自我某部生力軍配合當地守軍予匪重創後，該地事實上已成為浦東方面犯匪之最大墳塲，匪卅軍主力大部經兩天來之戰鬥業已損失將盡，其後續部隊卅一，廿，卅三各軍，於廿二廿三兩日陸續增援，並驅使甚多無辜民衆充當肉彈，然因我陸海空協力作戰，犯匪企圖吞下此一浦東重要據點，以切斷我淞滬咽喉之迷夢乃不得不歸於幻滅。至廿三日上午七時許，我守軍某部已改採主動攻勢，同時分路出擊，刻戰事仍在激烈進行中。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：廿三日正午十二時浦東方面電話：（一）廿二日晚九時起，匪以廿九·卅·卅一及北海·南京·上海縱隊·浙江大隊，集中全力，分出黃家宅·洋涇鎮·大金宅·龍正廟方面，向我軍陣地進犯，尤以大金家宅方面戰况最為激烈。（二）向大金家宅·黃家宅等地竄犯之匪，於廿二日晚一股藉夜色朦朧，乘隙竄入我某部陣地，經我機動部隊予犯匪以反包圍，使其進退維谷，並以熾盛火力夾擊，將竄入我軍陣地之匪悉數殲滅，遺屍四百餘具，狼狽潰逃。又另一股匪由右翼向我塘橋陣地蠢犯，亦被我軍猛烈火網將其擊退，匪出於無奈乃採用自命得意之人海戰術，向我全面波浪衝鋒，激戰截至昨日正午十二時，仍在大金家宅等地區慘烈進行中。（三）大金家宅·塘橋一帶我守軍羅指揮官，為鼓勵袍澤奮勇殲匪，親到陣前督戰，決不輕意放棄殺賊機會，據稱：現已將匪包圍聚殲中。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：廿三日上午八時前方電話，綜合戰果：匪軍自對蕰藻浜以北至長江間地區之攻擊被粉碎後，另糾合四個軍之兵力進犯浦東，企圖越過高橋，切斷吳淞咽喉，五日以來，匪豕突狼奔，氣焰頗盛，經我陸海空軍分別予以痛擊後，刻被阻於洋涇·高橋間地區，匪在我各種強大火力壓迫之下，被殲達兩萬餘，其卅軍·卅一軍每師殘餘已不足一團之數，前昨兩日作最後最大之一次掙扎後，已無力再犯，刻該綫戰事陷入停頓狀態中。淞滬防衛戰之第十一日，匪第二個攻擊重點又被擊破，我軍則愈戰愈勇，信心愈堅，顯而易見，保衛淞滬之基礎業經奠定。</p>
<h3>月浦劉行綫激戰　滬南守軍作殲滅性攻擊　南翔共軍攻金家宅未逞</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：（一）月浦西南之西路橋及吳宅之匪二千餘，廿三日下午五時三十分開始向我守軍陣地猛犯，我守軍某部咸抱有我無匪，有匪無我之精神，英勇反擊，匪傷亡甚衆，至發稿時止，雙方仍激戰中。（二）廿三日下午八時十分，我劉行東，楊行西南之老宅守軍，與來犯之匪發生激烈戰鬥，入暮滬郊傳來之隆隆砲聲，按卽為我軍所發射者。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕我劉行，楊行迄月浦之綫，我軍為保持主動態勢，廿三日仍不斷派出勁旅，分頭出擊，匪軍一如彎弓之鳥，甚少頑抗，故廿三日整日僅有局部小接觸。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕廿三日上午九時月浦前方電話：月浦，楊行，劉行等陣地之匪，連日受我嚴重打擊後，憊於奔命，已無再戰能力，判斷其殘部可能後調整補，企圖再犯，故連日來除微小接觸外，戰况甚為沉寂，廿二日整夜亦如休止狀態，刻我守軍利用難得之餘暇，提高警覺，一面加強工事，一面檢討此次作戰之得失，準備待機出擊，予匪殘部以致命打擊。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：滬南地區之匪，廿三日午後復捲土重來，新橋，七寶及陸家巷之綫，一時戰鬥頗形慘烈，惟據確實報告，此一綫匪軍之戰鬥力並非值得重視，其在戰略上之意義，殆為呼應浦東及滬西北之攻勢，該地守軍早有堅強準備，刻正對犯匪四個團作殲滅之攻擊。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕廿三日上午九時卅分軍息：滬西南七寶我前進據點，自守軍於取得相當代價主動撤離後，卽將匪誘至我主陣地前，並藉砲空掩護，集中火力反擊，廿二日午後我戰車部隊奉命增援，匪因傷亡慘重，卽向七寶方面回竄，刻正在我嚴密包圍中。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：廿三日午後六時陸行前方電話：南翔匪一部約二百餘名，廿三日晨一時卅分乘夜暗向我金家宅某部陣地進犯，我誘其至鹿柴附近，卽發揮所有之火力，予匪迎頭痛擊，激戰至四時許，匪漸感不支，我把握戰機，立卽抽調精銳守軍，一部由左翼向匪側擊，匪兩面受擊，頓形混亂，我乘勝突入匪陣，予以痛殲，匪傷亡慘重，棄屍纍纍，殘匪倉皇逃逸，是役斃匪一百餘名，生俘十三名，鹵獲衝鋒槍十二支，步槍百餘支，我官兵僅五名負傷，陣地屹立無恙。</p>
<h3>守軍戰鬥精神　發揮固有武德</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：過去十一日戰鬥過程中，我守軍表現高度之戰鬥精神，發揮軍人固有之武德，例如月浦西方之某連陣地，曾被匪攻陷，該連官兵經過英勇之戰鬥後，全部壯烈犧牲，無一人退出，該陣地於一小時後，復被我反擊收復。又楊行西面陣地被匪攻陷，守備該處某連官兵誓與陣地共存亡，堅持至最後一人一彈，嗣經援軍到達反擊，匪一團之衆全部被殲。又高橋南面前進據點被匪攻陷時，我某連長決不與匪兩立，守至最後一分鐘，全連弟兄均為國捐軀，彼亦自殺成仁。而在國軍陸海空協同一致發揮之威力下，匪軍以落伍慘酷之人海衝鋒戰術，不惜以人命為肉彈，且犧牲大而成功少（匪我傷亡為十與一之比），其士兵均極懐厭戰畏懼之心理，凡竄隙進入我口袋陣地者，多願放下武器，向國軍投降。</p>
<h3>廣播勸募勞軍　各界踴躍捐輸</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕昨日為本市慰勞會發動廣播勸募勞軍運動之第二日，除由維揚戲·彈詞范雪萍·竺水招·袁雪芬·徐玉蘭等參加播唱外，並有政務委員會常務委員谷正綱·陳市長·陳司令代表張泰祥·及兩路特別黨部李主委達三等播講勸募勞軍意義，慰勞會主委方治親往主持，並連續作第二次勸募廣播，情况至為熱烈。截至昨日中午止，該會一日半來，共計已認捐者有銀圓近一千枚，美鈔三百元，金圓券二十億，黃金三錢，毛巾五十打，香烟三百條，襪子四十打，並有海甯路正記理髮店捐一日所得，殊為難能可貴，詳細數字當可由明日發表。又，該會自今日起，仍委託各電台繼續報告，勸募勞軍，希各界熱心愛國人士踴躍捐輸，款物送交地點，各大報均有廣告登載。</p>
<h3>谷正綱廣播</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕京滬杭警備總司令部政務委員會委員谷正綱，為勸募勞軍運動，昨向全市市民廣播，題為「以民氣鼓勵士氣」，茲錄原文如下：</p>
<p>上海的同胞們！此次大上海保衛戰爭中，來犯的共匪，在獅子林·月浦·楊行·劉行，以及滬西七寶，浦東高橋各地，沒有一處不遭遇到我前綫將士英勇堅強的迎擊，沒有一次能逃出我前綫將士預定火網的殲滅。這十多天來，共匪主力的傷亡，已達五萬以上，被俘虜的共匪三千多人，繳獲了共匪的輕重機槍二百五十餘挺，以及其他戰利品很多，共匪的瘋狂攻勢，已遭受了一個嚴重的打擊。這次國軍這種英勇的精神，和這種輝煌的戰績，已使這一反侵略，反暴力，爭取國家民族獨立和人民生活自由的上海保衛戰，在國際間，在歷史上，已發揮其重大的意義，與無上的價值。</p>
<p>我們要擴大這一勝利的戰果，來打敗共匪，來消滅共匪，我們不僅要有英勇的士氣，同時更有蓬勃的民氣。無論將士，無論人民，我們均應認清國家至上，民族至上的意義，堅定軍事第一，勝利第一目標，以民氣鼓勵士氣，以士氣激發民氣，使民氣與士氣交流，同仇敵愾，英勇奮發，這就是我們偉大的民族精神和民主力量的表現，也就是我們剿匪勝利的支持力，和剿匪勝利的堅強基礎。</p>
<p>因此，我要誠懇的呼籲上海的同胞們，要效法歐美各國人民對於前綫將士的貢獻，我們各界同胞也要各盡氣力，做到一切為前綫，一切為勝利，現在將士們以他們的血肉來保衛我們的國家，保衛我們的上海，和保護我們的生命財產，這種精神，是多麼的偉大而值得我們的崇敬。</p>
<p>我現在更要呼籲上海的各界同胞，警覺到「拼命才能保命」，「輸產才能保產」的意義，本着「有錢出錢」，「有力出力」的精神，努力作下列的貢獻：</p>
<p>（一）有資產的同胞，如工廠的廠主，房地產的業主，公司·行號·銀行·錢莊的經理，以及持有金錢外幣和中產階級的人們，應多多捐獻。</p>
<p>（二）有技藝的同胞，如歌唱，戲劇，音樂，藝術等具有專長的人們，應該獻演藝術，勸募財物，充慰勞將士之用，或獻藝給將士欣賞，使將士在百戰之餘，得到精神上的安慰。</p>
<p>（三）知識界及青年同胞，應該用文字或演講來闡發剿匪的意義，以激發民氣，或寫慰勞將士的信，以鼓勵士氣。</p>
<p>（五）婦女同胞，除了能做上列各項工作外，應該為前綫將士獻鞋，洗衣，及為傷患將士作救護工作。</p>
<p>以上各項的貢獻，就是我們上海同胞愛國家愛自由的表現，也就是我們上海同胞民氣的表現。我希望我們上海同胞們，要發揚我們的民氣，來配合英勇的士氣，以爭取這次保衛戰爭的勝利。</p>
<h3>陳市長廣播</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕陳市長為勸募勞軍運動，於昨（廿三）日下午六時十分在上海電台廣播，茲探誌廣播詞全文如後：諸位同胞：為着衛護六百萬市民身家財產的安全，為着衛護五千年固有文化，爭取祖國的獨立自由，為着伸張正義，維護世界和平，總之，無論為着自己，為着國家民族，為着世界人羣，我們都要堅決的，萬衆一心的，竭盡一切可能，共同參加保衛大上海的工作。</p>
<p>計自上海保衛戰開始，到今天已經進入第二旬，十餘天來，我們堅強的陸軍，偉大的空軍，雄視東亞的海軍，無不抱着有我無敵的精神，奮勇聯合作戰，不分晴雨，不分晝夜，冒着惡劣天氣，冒着槍林彈雨，出生入死，壯烈殺敵，有時為着一點一綫之爭，不惜率犯難，浴血爭奪，一般將士的心目中，只有成功，沒有失敗，就是折臂斷趾，也必裏創再戰，其必須回到醫院療養的，病愈之後都立刻再赴前綫，盡其保國衛民的天職。這種驚天地，泣鬼神，不屈不撓，可歌可泣的忠勇事實，可說是辛亥革命及抗戰時期犧牲奮鬥精神的發揚光大，預料今後繼續發揮偉大力量，消滅敵人，還我自由，為期自應不遠。</p>
<p>惟是，軍民合作，實為戰勝的必要條件，我們陸海空軍全體將士，已盡其前綫殺敵的任務，所有六百萬市民，自應共同參加保衛大上海的神聖工作，在有力出力，有錢出錢的原則下，對於全體將士的作戰必需品，以及全體將士的生活醫療必需品，我們必須盡力募集捐輸，運送供應。進一步言，在一切為前綫，一切為勝利的原則下，卽把我們所有的一切人力，物力，財力，全都無條件貢獻前綫，亦不為過，旣無分於工農商學，更無分於男女老幼，保衛大上海，人人有份，人人有責，衆志可以成城的。</p>
<p>同胞們，輸產才能保產，拼命才能保命，現在是後方民衆輸產衛家衛己的時候了，深冀全體市民募獻一切，犧牲一切，共同為保衛大上海而努力。最後，敬祝諸位健康。</p>
<h3>方治廣播詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕上海市黨部主任委員方治，為勸募勞軍運動，昨向本市市民廣播，題為「共匪進攻上海失敗了」，茲錄原文如下：</p>
<p>昨天，兄弟曾向全市通報廣播「共匪自掘墳墓於上海」，報告了共匪慘敗的情形，今天，我更興奮地要告訴各位，浦東和劉行楊行方面的共匪攻勢，現在已經全部崩潰了。</p>
<p>共匪的力量，實在是沒有什麽了不起的。浦東方面的成績，經過兩天來我軍的英勇反攻，以及我某某等部生力軍的增援前綫，於是戰事進入了最高潮，尤其是高橋之役，予犯匪以最大的打擊，匪三十軍主力可以說大部份已損失殆盡，犯匪企圖吞下此一浦東重要據點，以切斷我淞滬咽喉的迷夢，乃不得不歸於幻滅了。現在可以向各位報告的，共匪的傷亡已經由五萬而增至七萬，俘虜的由三千而增至五千，今天晚上相信可以獲得鉅大的戰果。這種輝煌偉大的勝利，都是由於上海市各界同胞慰勞將士的熱忱所致，前方將士在我們全市同胞的熱忱支持下，使他們鼓舞歡欣，更加强了作戰的勇敢精神。尤其可貴的，是一般天真的小朋友，他們拿省下的糖菓錢來勞軍，還有一般只願出錢不願留名的熱心「無名氏」，他們更捐下了許多的物資和款項，這實在是非常難能可貴的。而最值得我們稱譽的，是友邦人士，也慷慨解囊，熱烈捐款，可見這次淞滬保衛戰爭，其利害所繫，不僅在維護上海市民的自由財產生活幸福，卽國際人士亦莫不寄予極大的同情。</p>
<p>在這一切為前綫，一切為將士，一切為剿匪的大前提下，我們後方人士的熱烈勞軍表現，是深深的打動了前綫英勇作戰的將士們的心靈的，當我們去勞軍時，他們對後方民衆的答覆，簡單而有力地只有一句，就是以「殲滅更多的匪敵，來報答上海市民的熱忱」，我們聽了，能不鼓舞歡欣。我相信愛自由愛國家的上海市民，會拿出更多更大的熱忱，來繼續不斷慰勞將士，藉以報答他們為國英勇殺敵的精神。</p>
<p>各位同胞，從今天開始，我們預備組織一個委員會，專門處理和分配對於這次勞軍籌募所得的款項和物品，希望我們全市六百萬同胞一致動員，更踴躍，更團結地參加這個慰勞運動。現在當我們在砲聲隆隆中接獲到前綫的不斷捷報時，我們知道共匪進攻上海是失敗了。</p>
<h3>南昌樟樹　國軍轉進</h3>

<h3>對邱定坤全家被殺案　盛世才剖析內情　認係謀財害命並無其他原因</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿三日電〕前任新疆省督辦現任國防部上將參議盛世才氏，認為其內弟邱定坤全家主僕十一人被殺案，係一謀財害命案件。盛氏廿三日上午單獨告中央社記者稱：邱定坤係於盛氏蒞新疆後三年，自東北到達新疆者，曾任新省軍校教官及副主任，現任西北長官公署少將參議，平日並無仇人，所謂「廿年冤仇一夜平」之壁書，依常理推測，兇犯於行兇時絕無暇書此，而必為兇犯之同黨於事後所書，故作虛玄，企圖掩飾其謀財害命之行動，同時預為將來一且被捕時，可藉口復仇，作為减輕罪刑之要求。依盛氏之判斷，此案亦絕非政治性之陰謀，盛氏認為此案主犯之一，必為在逃之齊副官，策劃此案者必為歷時甚久之有組織之刧財團體，其份子至少者有三分之一必為常至邱宅之熟人，故於行兇之際，恐被傭僕識破，並倂予殺害。盛氏判斷齊副官行兇後必仍匿居蘭州市內，或附近市郊，尚未逃走，其所刧財物，亦必仍藏蘭市，藏匿地點又必係事先妥為擇定者。盛氏稱：齊副官亦為東北人，跟隨邱宗濬已有八年之久，表面忠實，但其在親友認為齊甚狡猾，曾主張撤換之。盛氏判斷邱定坤看電影歸家後，齊副官必卽將兇手放入室內，邱宅備有自衛手槍三枚，亦必先為兇犯設計奪去。關於盛氏致其岳父邱宗濬之函件，據盛氏稱，此函發於五月五日，因太原已告失守，盛氏深恐將來邱宗濬等被圍在共匪鐵幕之內，財命兩難保全，遂勸邱宗濬迅卽飛台或穗港居住，至函中謂「須守秘密，勿愛財物，勿乘汽車」者，蓋恐途中遭匪徒之暗算也。盛氏又稱：邱定坤存放紐約銀行之美金四萬元，係抗戰期間自渝匯美，彼時邱定坤妻患腎結石，擬飛美割治之醫藥費用，嗣其妻改在蘭州割治，並未赴美，款亦儲存迄今。盛氏已於廿二日接獲蘭州東北同鄉會關於報告此案之電報，渠卽擬電請西北長官馬步芳及甘省主席郭寄嶠緝捕兇犯，早日破案，盛氏係於今年一月抵台，現與其同自新疆來之衛隊十四人卜居台北。</p>

<p>〔路透社香港廿三日電〕港府防務部發言人稱，當局已擬具計劃，俾於香港及九龍租界地內部發生動亂時，出動軍隊支援警察，渠拒不說明目前港九區是否已有內部威脅存在或將港九局勢與馬來相比，但曰當局雖不欲用軍隊巡邏九龍邊界，但陸軍隨時在準備狀態中，俾一接通知，能於短期內出動協助警察。渠又談：在九龍另築新機塲之問題，尚在考慮之中，目前在港空軍有噴火式戰鬥機一隊，桑德蘭是式飛船偵察機一隊及奧斯特式空中瞭望機一隊，其中若干飛機，宜於發生內亂時擔任協助警察及陸軍偵察之用。</p>

<h3>閩發銀元輔幣券　市塲已漸趨穩定</h3>
<p>〔中央社福州廿三日電〕由於閩境局勢日來稍見緩和及通用銀圓·銀角·銅角，此間市塲漸趨穩定，惟交易尚未恢復常態。閩省銀行廿三日開始發行銀圓輔幣券，票面分一分·五分·一角·二角·五角五種，由中央銀行撥給銀元及省府物資作為準備，十足兌現，週來市塲小額交易所發生之困難已解除，社會經濟活動頓形靈活，惟商塲貨價仍未劃一，除以銀圓計價者外，仍多有以黃金·白米折算者，米市塲因閩北失陷，糧源缺乏，無米供售，黑市米價在黃金二錢以上，至黃金與銀圓之比率，經當局規定為每五銀圓兌換黃金一錢，省府員工薪餉亦按照銀圓發放。</p>
<h3>北平和平真象　（續昨）</h3>
<p>其次，再談一般公教人員。遠在圍城之初，城內就發現前綫司令員林彪的傳單，約法八章了，其中四五兩條，是關於公教人員的。第四條說，解放軍入城後，凡學校教職員，文化教育，衛生機構及其他社會公益機關職員，均照常供職，解放軍一律保護，不受侵犯。第五條說，凡省市縣各級政府官員及保甲人員，凡無反動行為，而有一技之長者，均准分別錄用。當時很多公教人員，被生活苦壓多年，看見着若干闊官富貴，挾金南飛，於羨恨交加，望禨興歎之時，忽見此單，多謂我們憑着心力吃飯，好在都是中國人，談不到漢奸不漢奸，人家旣保護又錄用，誰來給誰幹好了。及和運旣濃，更盛傳共黨入城後政務機關只換一首長，餘均不動，學術或技術機關連首長都不換，且待遇均發實物，數量不論階級，均按家庭人口多寡而定，當時一般公教人員，皆暗祝解放軍之速來，有的所謂頑固份子，且以失節為慮。</p>
<p>時光過得雖慢，解放軍終於入城了，政務機關先接收的河北省政府，軍事機關起初是警備司令部，接收的方式是財產傢具全數要去，大小職員掃地出門，甚至連工友都沒留一個。河北省政府自楚主席溪春而下，廉潔苦幹，任人皆知，但接收者則都帶着有官皆食無吏不污的眼鏡看人，故於接收時百般挑剔，處處為難，好容易交代清了，聽說於二月廿四日又接到通知，謂河北省政府　交給華北人民政府，要從新造冊，並附說明，造好後各主管更須親自交代，口頭報告，那時各級職員早解散了，無人造冊，桃秘書長及各廳處長據實以報，但得的回答是難道你們自己還不會寫字嗎，爲什麽必須假手於人？不得已，這羣孤臣孽子，只好帶着老花眼鏡，自造清冊了。至於華北人民政府接收時情形如何，則無由得悉。現在楚主席正隱居家中，因遷平時他正作潘陽城防司令報戶口時照此堪寫，作了主席也沒有去改，因此南長街街長及公安局特工人員屢次找他談話，叫他與其他零散軍官一塊去受訓，雖屢次託焦實齊去給疏通，但迄今還常去麻煩他，又他南長街七十四號的房子，是到平時買胡伯翰的，現在共黨也要接收，經託人疏通後，始准他暫住。省政府各級職員都已失業，我雖平時，姚秘書長正計算於交清之後以買倆賣倆（北平買賣銀的叫賣聲）為生，低級職員更不必問。</p>
<p>繼省政府之後，就是市政府了，葉劍英於接收那天謂：他們對城市工作毫無經騐，一切都須跟舊人學習，但革命理論則須跟他們學習，故科長以下只好暫時留用，但每日除八小時辦公時間外，還須學習革命兩小時，閱讀人民日報，馬列主義，及新民主主義，並聽那些斗大字不識半升的老幹部訓話，將來如何擺佈，尚不可知</p>
<p>至於學術及技術機關呢？確是原封沒動，但每單位都派了三個軍管會的聯絡員，就等於日本佔領時代的聯絡官，也就是這個機關的太上皇，事無大小，均須請示，卽令買幾張十行紙，也須他們批准。日本時代的聯絡官，還都學有專長，令人佩服，而這些聯絡員呢，則均為自五六歲起卽受共黨嚴格訓練的標準黨員，年齡均祗二十歲左右，談到馬列主義，倒還一知半解，設該所管機關業務，則一竅不通，那些專家們受這羣小孩們的統治，苦悶之情，可想而知。不知此也，最痛苦的事，要算學習革命了，試想這羣專家們，每天也像前述公務員一般，叫他們唸浮淺不通的人民日報及新民主主義，其痛苦更不問可知。至於生活呢，則醫院院長，專科以上學校的校長，或校務維持會主席，是四百至四百五十斤小米，大學教授，中學校長是三百至四百斤小米，中學教員或小學校長是二百至三百斤小米，小學教員是二百斤左右小米，留用之其他公務人員，其比例亦如是。現在北平是小米世界了，公教人員旣都發小米，小米當然泛濫的賤，而別的物價則都很高，小米換白麵，聽說現在的行市是三比一。又，普通公教人員一人掙的，只够一人吃用，養家則須另打主意。</p>
<p>談到精神或情緒，則更苦不堪言，勝利之初，各級政府也曾留用過偽組織人員，現在被留用者，其苦惱較他們尤有過之，偽組織人員被留用，不過是多聽幾聲刺耳的漢奸一辭罷了，現在則除常聽到已不刺耳的「偽」「反動」「反革命」「蔣犯」等辭之外，最苦惱的要算聯絡員的訪問了，由六七歲起至現在止，每年的行止，都不厭其詳的審問，這個問了那個問，未身受者設辦法知道這種苦味，設發現你曾與所謂反動政黨有關，那麻煩將更多了，現在每個人都惴惴不安，不可終日。</p>
<p>至於縣級公務人員呢，則於各縣撤守時多已到平，此輩的中心工作旣是戡亂，那能不直接間接的得罪個把共產黨呢，北平旣已變為共黨世界，真是有冤的報冤，有仇的報仇，各縣共黨都紛紛到平去找，解回本縣去清算，他們所受威脅，較原在北平者更大，現多終日惶惶，不知所措。至於保甲人員，則雖屢表効忠，但換區長後，就開始開區民大會清算，卽令清算無疵，也逼令當衆宣讀印就的悔過書了事，其要點是不該幫助反動政府作事，不該幫助反動政府征兵征夫，不該貪污舞弊，其清廉自守者，也得悶着委曲去唸，至於悔過撤職後又將如何收拾，則尚不知。現在北平保甲制度業已取消，改為街閭制度，每街設一街長，由共產黨幹部充任，小南海北部的都有，街下為閭，閭長則由街長指定一個他認為忠誠可靠者充任。（未完）</p>
<h3>大上海屹立無恙　能否久守端視政府決心</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿三日電〕上海保衛戰現正激烈進行中，此國際觀瞻所繫，擁有六百萬市民之大上海，是否能久守，其關鍵全在中央政府。據悉：共軍原企圖於本月十七日攻陷上海，嗣以我英勇守軍抵抗，迄未得逞，中共復廣播稱，為便利國軍之撤退，定十九日攻佔上海，詎知共軍之計未酬，上海仍屹立未動，頃聞中共再作廣播，為顧慮上海六百萬市民之生命財產，決延緩攻勢，暫緩佔領上海等語，足見國軍能戰善守，真能確保上海，而中共一貫慣用之宣傳伎倆，已為我英勇國軍之堅強地勘而粉碎矣。據甫由滬抵穗之王曉籟氏語記者，國軍能確守上海，絕無疑義，上海六百萬市民咸能敵愾同仇，與國軍打成一片，合作無間，上海保衛戰之所以能取勝，其故在此，上海人恐懼共軍一旦控制上海，則生命財產固將不保，卽個人生活自由亦受剝奪，故上海市民無不反對共黨，惟戰事日益激烈，消耗日甚，後繼為難，上海國軍之能否久守問題，端視政府之決心。</p>
<h3>社論　從銀圓談到物價</h3>
<p>——從速成立銀元公開市塲</p>
<p>銀元牌價，第一日中央銀行訂為九百六十萬元，嗣於本月二十一日改為一千三百二十萬元，昨日起又改為三千六百萬元。這種機動式的調整，完全是順應經濟上的自然趨勢，實在是值得稱道的。本來目前金圓券的發行數額，單就應付軍政費用的支出，數字頗鉅，市塲上憑空　增加了這批生力軍，物價怎能不跳？所以現階段的物價狂漲，並非造因於物價的本身，可以說完全處於被動的地位，這一點是應該認明的。</p>
<p>本質上，銀元是屬於金融性的商品，它的漲落，當然脫不了物價　範疇，尤其在目前的時期中，銀元不但成為普通的商品，更因為它具有實值，單位較小，運用靈活，所以實在也是處於貨幣的地位，人民有了銀元，可以保持幣值，可以買賣日用品，事實上也是樂於收藏的。故當每次公教人員或其他薪水階級發薪時，銀元交易，特別旺盛，這種情形，更足以顯示出上項理論的正確；可是從另一方面而論，銀元的價格，不是操在掌握大量銀元的中央銀行，而是決定在多數從事投機的銀牛手中，這確是令人有點茫然。</p>
<p>最近中央銀行亦鑒於銀元價格被一般銀牛所操縱，以及銀元交易分散在馬路中角落裏，影響正常的經濟發展，所以不久前曾有規劃成立銀元公開市塲的決定：但此種事實，迄今還沒有實現，實在有　使人覺得我國中央銀行作用的微薄。現代世界各國的中央銀行，多已循由運用公開市塲的活動，而求得市塲的穩定，我國目前情勢雖然相當的惡劣，但中央銀行運用公開市塲的政策，自也有其必要。</p>
<p>成立銀元市塲的目的，即在於嗣後中央銀行可循此途徑，控制市塲：同時銀元掛牌，當能每日採取機動式的措施，使牌價更可趨於合理化的方向。至於銀元的版式，我們以為初步掛牌時，不妨分別訂定價格，但除船洋外，應隨時收回，交由中央造幣廠該鑄新幣，那末市塲上的雜洋，當可隨之絕跡，所有大頭，鷹，龍洋，港洋，雜洋等，不過是歷史上的一種名稱罷了。天下事本來應該用「以德服人」的手段，在處理經濟大事時，更是應該如此；何况今日的一般銀洋持有者，大部是一般公教人員和薪水階級　儲蓄，如不顧一切，硬性的規定銀元價格，則無異是使得他們血汗換來的報酬，憑空橫被剝奪，試問當局者又何忍出此？</p>
<p>要之，當前中央銀行成立銀元公開市場，無論從法理上，人情上，經濟制度上看，都是有其必要的，唯有中央銀行成立銀元公開市塲，銀元價格，才能納於正軌；同時社會物價的紛擾，也可受其影響，頓告解除。</p>

<h3>巴黎玫瑰大理石宮　四強外長重聚一堂　數千民衆爭睹大會盛况</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿三日廣播：英·美·法·蘇四國外長於廿三日下午二時五十五分（世界標準時間）集合於此間之玫瑰大理石宮，揭開歷史性的四強外長會議之序幕。數千民衆　集於大理石宮大門外，新聞記者及攝影記者約五十人鵠立門外，竚候四外長蒞臨。四外長乘警察駕駛之機動車直駛宮門，顧問及專家接踵而至，艾契遜首先到達會塲，步出汽車後，與傑塞普相偕入宮。貝文夫婦於四分鐘後乘英大使館汽車到達，其後為維辛斯基之汽車，車上插有蘇聯國旗，法外長許曼在其他三外長未到前已先在宮中等候。新聞記者忙於攝取照片，旋卽退出會塲，同時四國外長會議第一次會議遂告啟幕矣。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿三日電〕四強外長會議開會地點在巴黎西端豪華的玫瑰大理石宮中。英美法三外長昨日又在法外交部內舉行九十分鐘之會談，事後國務院新聞官麥克台莫表示，三外長討論德國問題已有相當時間，應已知如何處理此一問題。艾契遜與會畢離法外交部時，捨車步行返美國大使館，卽與美無任所大使傑塞普，共和黨外交顧問杜勒斯等共進午餐，在參加本屆外長會議之四外長中，僅貝文外相亦曾參加以前之歷屆外長會，艾契遜·許曼尚係第一次參加外長會，維辛斯基亦係第一次以首席代表之身份赴會。本屆外長會議揭幕時，各外長所面臨的一般問題可概述如下：（一）歐洲今已分裂，蘇聯與西方國家能否同意德國問題的解決辦法，（二）四強若同意德國之分裂，則東西間的貿易將永遠破裂，而足以鼓勵雙方的猜疑：（三）若同意德國的統一，則將加緊德國未來地位的政治鬥爭；（四）四強亦可能同意建立一個在政治上分裂而在經濟上統一的德國，但其條件尚待磋商。蘇聯贊成有中央集權的德國，受共產黨的控制而用公民投票的方法，依照一紙候選人名單遴選政府。西方國家則主張設立聯邦德國共和國，用全民選舉自由秘密投票的方法，自各政黨中遴選一個聯邦政府，本屆外長會的主要問題卽為如何消滅此一東西強國間主義上的差異。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿二日電〕艾契遜昨日抵此後，三國外長卽行集議，審議外交次長擬就之三十二頁報告書，今日審議完竣並核准。聞西方外長核准之次長報告書中有下列兩點：（一）反對蘇方可能提出早日結束對德軍事佔領之任何建議；（二）在原則上同意德國應統一，但堅持不應在使德國成為蘇聯附庸之條件下統一。西方外長之最後一次初步集議，於午前十時三十分開始，十一時五十分結束。隨同艾契遜與會者有杜勒斯·傑塞普與國務院參議波侖。當時三國外長神情均頗歡欣。貝文批評杜爾斯之言稱：「午後亦有集會，係法英兩國足球隊交鋒。」貝文旋到塲觀戰，艾契遜與杜爾斯則各偕夫人遊凡爾賽。艾契遜旋於午後召集其顧問赴美大使館商談。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電〕英美法三國外長今晨在法國外交部舉行最後一次會議，對三國代表及各德國問題專家所提出之預備談話報告，加以批准，且同意對四國會談進展之宣佈辦法，準備向蘇聯外長建議採用昔日所使用之方法，卽在每次會議後，由各國代表團發言人舉行記者招待會，發表該次會議之經過。</p>
<h3>波恩憲法正式公布實施　西德共和國誕生　政府與國會三個月內舉行選舉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿三日廣播：波恩訊：德國制憲議會廿三日將新憲法公佈施行，西德聯邦共和國於焉正式誕生。西德聯邦將包括美·英·法佔領區內之各邦，但門戶依然洞開，等待蘇佔區各邦之加入。惟衆料蘇聯佔領狀態存在一天，東德將繼續留於戶外一天。制定憲法之政治家七十人將宣布解散議會。新共和國政府及國會將於今後三個月內舉行選舉。柏林並不包括在新聯邦以內，但得派遣代表列席國會旁聽。非共產黨員八十八人簽署新憲法，儀式簡單隆重。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社弗蘭克福廿二日電〕波恩制憲議會將於星期一作最後一次會議，正式公佈憲法，規定成立西德聯邦共和國。屆時各地方議會主席及西方三盟國首長皆將出席。德國政界人士對此舉極為重視。彼等強調謂：西德憲法已經巴伐里亞以外之西德區各邦一致通過，且受西德各政黨之一致擁護，僅巴伐里亞之基督教社會黨與共黨為例外，此點可表示西德之團結。</p>
<h3>美蘇間關係　可能獲得改善</h3>
<p>克萊在美發表廣播演說</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿二日電〕前德境美軍總司令克萊將軍，今日在此間廣播時宣稱：美蘇兩國間之關係，可能改善，但認為蘇聯各領袖目下尚不擬放棄其「霸持世界」之願望。克萊繼謂：「至於冷戰，吾人可獲得協議，而使局勢改進。但吾人不應遺忘，共產主義之真正目標乃霸持世界，此一目標，決不致放棄。」</p>
<h3>英報發表評論　指蘇政策不變</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿三日電〕關於五月廿三日在巴黎舉行之四國外長會議，「時與潮」撰論評述稱：不論蘇聯領袖要求召開外長會議之真正動機為如何，茍吾人以為彼等在外交政策上已決定作重大之改變，則屬絕大錯誤。吾人必須假設彼等之基本政策一無變化，且彼等仍將努力達到以下之目的，阻礙西德組成依西方原則而實行之政治與經濟生活，阻礙西方國家不致因北大西洋公約而達到堅固之安全。「時與潮」最後稱：西方國家切不可離開已取之路綫，且應在不犧牲重要原則之條件下與蘇聯達成協議。「經濟學人」亦強調此次外長會議中之困難與危險，並稱，西方國家應首先就對德政策作一明白之規定。該報指出，唯一明智之途徑為在外長會議開幕時公布，西方國家之願望卽統一德國，撤退佔領軍，並提出相當之條件。該報繼稱，西方國家除保證保護德國之政治自由外，又應重申貝爾納斯前所提出四強締結五十年公約之建議，以便維持德國裁軍事宜及阻止德軍軍力復興。茍蘇聯果如彼等所宣傳之酷愛和平，則此種建議應可成為西方國家與蘇聯達成和解之政策之第一步。</p>
<h3>戴高樂演說　抨擊波恩憲法</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電〕戴高樂將軍今日在法國人民陣綫大會休會時演說，強調法國應恢復足夠之力量，以平衡德國之勢力。戴氏抨擊波恩之西德憲法，認為此乃德意志之恢復，且謂對大西洋公約在未獲輔助之措置前，不應予以批准。戴氏希望法德間能獲諒解。但謂，此種諒解，需有某種條件。而主要之條件，為法國應在法屬北非協助下重行強盛，以平衡新德國之力量，而使兩國間之經濟諒解可能實現。戴氏強調稱：法國應在其資源能力內恢復其經濟財政力量。大會休會時宣佈：該黨之對外政策，國防政策，及對法國同盟政策，皆與法政府不同，且攻擊政府在財政經濟社會各方面之屢次失敗。</p>
<h3>緬軍收復英申</h3>
<p>〔路透社仰光廿二日電〕被加倫軍佔據十六個星期之英申城，已於今日經政府軍收復。該城在仰光以北十哩，緬政府軍進佔時，加倫軍已全部北撤，原在該城之加倫總統巴以濟亦已逃脫。當加倫軍撤退後，城內居民卽高懸白旗，該城原有居民二萬，前在臨時休戰期間曾有一萬人撤至仰光。英申中央監獄，號稱世界第三最大監獄完整無損，獄中尚有囚犯約五百人。政府軍公報同時又宣布，政府軍同時亦向仰光北七十哩另一加倫據點泰戈進迫。</p>
<h3>美原子委會主席　造成大笑柄</h3>
<p>參議員要求渠卽行辭職</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕共和黨參議員希根洛泊，今日要求李林塞爾氏，辭去原子能委員會主席之職，認為此委員會為造成許多笑柄之原因，最近失蹤之鈾二三五以及將獎金給予一部份不應獲悉該會秘密之人員，卽為二例。按希根洛泊曾任國會原子能委員會主席。</p>
<h3>哥國新內閣　人選已確定</h3>
<p>前警察總監任總理</p>

<h3>在蘇聯日俘　應在卅萬人以上</h3>
<p>麥帥顧問懷疑蘇報導數字</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿三日電〕盟國駐日最高統帥麥克阿瑟元帥之政治顧問西爾特稱：據審慎之估計，日本戰俘現仍在蘇聯手中者「應」在三十萬人以上。西巴特說明此點，以答復莫斯科塔斯社所報告蘇聯遣送戰俘管理處之正式聲明，據稱：在本年五月之十一月內，所有留在蘇聯之全部日戰俘均將遣返本國。塔斯社發表此等戰俘之總數僅有九萬七千人。西巴特指出：九萬五千之數字為第二次世界大戰以來蘇聯政府所發表之第一次估計。五月三日在東京啟程前來此間述職之前，渠曾代表麥帥向蘇聯代表親自提出抗議，認為蘇聯對於日俘數字，並未提供充分之情報。本年四月間西巴特致函蘇聯代表，請求發表關於日戰俘死亡，失蹤與重病之報導。蘇聯從未向盟總提供此種報導，但西巴特指出此種報導對於日本人民極關重要，尤其對於有關個人之家屬。蘇聯所獲之戰俘，不但在東方，卽在西方亦毫無報導。本年美國曾先後兩次請求蘇聯報導德國戰俘之情形。按德戰俘人數估計約有五十萬，其命運至今仍籠罩在秘密中。自去年十一月以來蘇聯迄未將日戰俘遣送回國，當時遣送工作之中止，據稱由於氣候及結冰之情形，盟總雖迭次表示願協助克服此種困難，亦仍無效。去年十一月份最後一次遣送之名單，亦表明蘇聯連續十八個月並不履行盟總與蘇聯所訂每月遣送戰俘五萬名之協定。</p>

<h3>福萊斯特跳樓前　曾自殺三次</h3>
<p>美無綫電評述員透露</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕無綫電評述員皮爾遜為最初公開披露前國防部長福萊斯特患病甚劇之一人。渠在廿一晚例行廣播中稱，僅在二週之前，第四次自殺企圖為貝茜斯特海軍醫院雇員所阻。渠並未說明福氏用何法圖自殺，僅謂福氏在福羅里達州曾以懸樑，割脈管，及服安眠藥等法圖自盡，福萊斯特所以被遷至貝茜斯特者，卽因此等三次自殺企圖。</p>

<h3>前盟管會英代表　譴責美扶助日本</h3>
<p>將使日再度威脅世界</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿二日電〕前任不列顛共和聯邦出席東京盟國管制日本委員會代表鮑爾所撰「日本—敵人乎盟友乎？」一書，頃已出版，書內表示美國恐將聽任日本再度成為一種威脅。鮑氏稱，對蘇聯之恐懼，已使美國以「寄予厚望之盟友」，而非「加以痛恨之敵人」視日本，三年有半之佔領期內，日本之社會機構或其鄰邦之政治情况，並無根本之改觀。鮑氏又稱，「美國長此在遠東保持其目前之戰略利害關係，則美國頗易壓制日本將來再施侵略之任何徵象，此點或屬實情，抑美國保持其在此區之軍事與政治管制，諒將繼續耗費美國大量資源。而商業方面之補償，則微不足道，是以吾人未能確定美國將準備無限期保持此等義務。日本現從美國獲得之經濟援助，更可能引起國際糾紛，恢復日本為東亞之工塲，豈非幫助日本重新建立其經濟上之帝國主義，戰爭時期，吾人曾流許多汗血，耗絕大資材，力圖摧毀日本在經濟上之帝國主義」。</p>
<h3>日議會休會</h3>

<h3>柏林鐵路工潮形勢嚴重　美英法司令集會　對蘇方與工人衝突將採取對策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿三日電〕柏林鐵路工人罷工第三日，形勢仍然嚴重，美軍司令霍萊已召集英法兩軍司令於今晨開會，商議對策。據霍萊稱：「此種難堪局勢須要吾人注意。此事已非復蘇方管理鐵路局與工人間之糾紛，路局方面已利用武裝份子及警察彈壓工潮，並以永遠解雇工人為威脅。」目前柏林各佔領區鐵路已近恢復常態，僅高架鐵路尚未恢復通車。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林廿二日電〕從柏林蘇佔領區出發之共產黨反罷工者以及武裝警察今日與高架鐵道之德國罷工工人爭奪柏市高架鐵道幹綫，連續發生血戰，受蘇方控制之徳警在混戰中開槍，死一人，傷十八人。是為罷工引起暴動之第二日，警方估計負傷者總數已達一千人。今日整日除規模較小之毆鬥外，至少發生血戰九起，雙方互相指責對方企圖於四強外長明日在巴黎集會之前夕，發動內戰。在柏林英區之夏樂登堡車站，日間曾易手四次，英區武裝警察後來佔據該站，彼等奉有命令，共黨如再加以射擊，得格殺勿論。罷工者所隸屬之獨立性UGO鐵路工會某領袖，揚言除除非獲致協議，將發動大罷工。但於廿二日深晚，罷工領袖決定不取此舉，僅重申蘇聯所控制之一切徳警盡離柏林三西區之要求，按柏林之高架鐵道，包括柏林西區者在內，根據國際協定，係由蘇聯管制。德路工係於廿日午夜發動罷工，要求付以西方盟國發行之馬克，勿付以比較無價值之蘇聯所發行之馬克。罷工發動後，當卽發生戰鬥，四十八小時來復又逐步趨烈。</p>
<h3>法總統歐禮和　鼓勵國人努力</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電〕法國總統歐禮和今日稱：法國正在趨向復興之道路上前進。但謂：馬歇爾計劃在一九五二年卽將中止，故法人決不能鬆懈。總統謂：「吾人已極接近目標，但決不可聽任政黨之意氣或無理由之幻想破壞一切。吾人必須將政治觀念置於一旁，忘却政治上之爭執及紛歧，而在共和國之前提下及政治經濟社會穩定之前提下，共同努力。」</p>
<h3>南愛政府反對　愛爾蘭法案</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿二日電〕愛爾蘭外交部今反對英國政府在最近通過之愛爾蘭法案中，謂英國將保證愛爾蘭繼續分裂事提出抗議。此間之南愛政府情報局特發表冗長之公報，謂英政府在愛爾蘭法案內所取之片面無効揩置，與英愛間互相友善合作之政策不相符合。英國政府在下院討論愛爾蘭法案前，旣未通知愛爾蘭外交部，亦未與愛爾蘭商權。</p>
<h3>美專家對援助落後國計劃　提出必須採取步驟　經濟開發之先須造成有利環境</h3>
<p>關於杜魯門總統就職演辭中所建議四點計劃之全世界技術與財政協助之合作方案，在其籌備工作中已透示落後國家必須如何建立其較高之生活標準，及其他國家如何並協助此等落後國家。此事最近之發展之一為聯合國國際勞工機構理事長摩斯在此間宣佈國際勞工機構已在全世界四大重要據點設立技術訓練中心。同時，代表世界銀行，聯合國經濟與就業委員會，及美國務院與農業部等各機構之發言人，表示以下各點為必須採取之步驟。需求經濟開發之各國，其大部必要之基金，必須取諸其本國之人民，其餘則設法吸收其他各地之私人投資。為求成功起見，各該國必須創造一種有利之「環境」，保證投資者有防止金錢損失與獲得相當利潤之合理保障。在大多數落後之國家，農業發展必須列為第一，而此事需要近代化之運輸，電力及灌溉。工業之發展必須列為第二。統盤之計劃形式如下：更多之食物，衛生情形之更進，以及防止疾病之計劃將產生更健全之民衆，從而可以產生更堅強之工人，技術訓練必須養成足夠技術與管理人員，力能使用現代方法。穩定之政府以及穩定之通貨與對投資者之保證，必能吸引更多之投資，藉以從事開發計劃。在任何開發計劃着手之前，必須從事澈底之科學研究，藉以先行確定該國是否確具充份之天然資源，且可保證充份之生產，而所生產之產品，當能在世界美元地區銷售足以償付現代配備之必要輸入，而仍能使該國處於良好之收支地位。落後各國於採取此等步驟並能符合此等條件後，當能以穩健步伐走向更好之生活水準，日益能與更僥倖之國家相比擬。專家對於此點，均表同意。國際商會之馬佛里星期四在成功湖作說時，曾告聯合國經濟就業委會謂，落後地區之經濟開發有賴於造成一種「更有利於投資之氣候」。美國代表魯平告委會稱：使美國資本不能到達急迫需要之地區者，其原因不在求取厚利之願望，而在恐懼心理。恐懼心理之產生，乃由於政治及幣制之不安定，收益未能兌成他種貨幣，捐稅龍雜，以及投資之危險，美國現正準備與其他國家談商條約，以祛除造成恐懼之理由。世界銀行在致該委會之備忘錄中稱：「该行之放款僅以貸與健全與生產性之計劃為限，此種決策不致動搖。」但指出：「落後國家之開發有賴於資本之不斷流入，而此種資本應投於一連串有條理之計劃中。」該行在一固定投資率上繼續投資，卽可協助各國避免商業情况突然之變化。根據本行經騐，達到較高實質收入之最佳途徑，厥為投資農業。」此項目的亦常須佐以對輕工業或重工業之投資，始能達到。但為極端為工業而注重工業，甚而忽視重工業，則落後國家可能徒具開發之　　表像，而無其實質。」美農業部長勃萊南最近演講稱：「世界三分之二之人口依恃農業為生，在落後國家中，百分比率較此為高。雖有此種生產糧食之努力，但世界極大多數人民仍不能足食。」勃萊南向杜魯門總統之經濟開發委員會報告世界技術援助計劃實施展望。據稱：「此項計劃非旦夕間事。縱使吾人經由糧農機構及其他聯合國機構，聯合利用各國之資源，此舉亦非一蹴可就。原因之一乃在缺乏足夠之有訓練人員，以從事此項工作。抑有進者，吾人發現真正工作必須由當地民衆本身予以完成。吾人須能協助訓練大批本地人員，使在其本國傳佈科學知識與技術。然後吾人之努力始能對於世界生產發生顯著效果。在三分之二為農業之世界中，必須注重此項計劃，改進糧食及織維之生產。惟同時吾人應牢記一點，此卽吾人於增加科學對農業方面之應用，許多工業發展亦必相輔並進。茍無道路將產品運至市塲，則增加食物之產量亦無多大價值，是以鐵路與卡車，冰箱與棧房，罐頭食物廠與分派機構係屬必要。肥料，殺蟲劑與工具亦屬不可或缺者。簡言之，吾國農業受惠於工業之各種利益，亦須在此等國家中加以普及，胥知吾國之農業如無工業方面之輔助，亦不能較吾國擬予援助各國之農業具有更大效能。」摩斯謂，國際勞工機構甫於印度新德里成立國際勞工機構亞洲技術訓練處，由舊金山之安德遜担任處長，安氏為一專家，以擬訂洛克希特飛機公司之戰時訓練制度著稱。摩斯稱，國際勞工機構歐洲技術訓練處亦已在羅馬成立，由英國勞工次長羅斯領導。該訓練處將暫時集中注意於義國之需要，惟以後將轉而注意整個歐洲之技術援助需要。拉丁美洲之技術訓練處已在計劃階段，近東之技術訓練處則正在調查階段。此等區域訓練處將對需要經濟技術援助以從事開發之國家提供指導與服務。（美國新聞處）</p>
<h3>逸園積水不能用　東青改今日決戰　數千球迷昨徒勞往返</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三強足球邀請賽東青大決戰，昨日又因連朝下雨，逸園塲地，積水未乾，潮濕不堪，為愛護塲地，不得不順延一天，改定今日下午三時半，仍在原處逸園舉行。球迷望眼欲穿，昨徒勞往返者數千人，主辦當局深表歉意。今日門券一律一千萬元，為整頓逸園門口秩序，門券提前於中午十二時起在市體育館發售，逸園門口概不出售，屆時除軍警維持秩序外，由四維童子軍到塲協助。青白隊通告各隊員於下午二時半在雙龍浴室集合出發，過時不候。今日裁判方榮富，巡邊陳福寶徐國樑。兩隊陣容列下：</p>
<p>東華</p>
<p>張邦綸</p>
<p>吳祺祥　謝錫川　張林根</p>
<p>陳良璉　李孔晋　韓尼波　於治興</p>
<p>李垚　高秀清　韓龍海　陳明哲　錢元慶　關永常</p>

<p>張仁義　錢長榮　孟義良　伏迺堂</p>
<p>金祿生　羅壽福　劉隆馨　劉體寅　顧以　　費春華</p>
<p>歷來東青大戰，每次必轟動全滬，此番當不例外。兩隊曾在上週四遭遇，因在大雨滂沱中作戰，臨時改為友誼賽，東華僅十人應戰，結果各一和局，足見東華雄風不减當年。該隊守門為我世運代表張邦綸，穩健不凡，上下三路極具把握。防禦方面有吳祺祥張林根韓尼波三員驍將，足能應付青白一羣新將。陳良璉對鐵路一役，有至高評價，前鋒韓龍海陳明哲高秀清李垚四將，技術精嫻，尤以龍海之身手最為人稱道。今日出戰青白，自必發揮其威力。</p>
<p>青白新膺本屆聯賽冠軍，為目前足球壇之驕子，今日出塲陣容除原班人馬外，復有息影已久之國脚嚴士鑫重作馮婦，可見該隊對是役之重視，該隊進攻方面，人選整齊，金祿生羅壽福相當剽悍，劉隆馨靜若虎子，動若脫兔，在前兩次演出，博有好評。他如費春華自港返滬後，球藝猛晋，屆時與金祿生兩翼齊飛，必予東華以威脅。中衛綫孟義良坐鎮，將全力組織韓龍海之迅速突破。屆時孟能否關煞龍海，為今日雙方勝負之關鍵。總至兩雄相逢一塲惡戰，自在不免，究竟三強孰能稱雄，看今日之一戰，方可定奪。</p>
<h3>甲組乒乓聯賽　華聯今戰郵務</h3>

<p>華聯三戰三勝，此役四次出馬，相逢郵務，如能闖過此關，將繼續與綢白全綠聯星三強相逢，一爭短長。郵務業已四度演出，雖然三敗一勝，但實力並不遜於華聯，屆時必出全力奪取勝利，雙方定有劇戰。今日秩序如下：</p>

<h3>鋒芒顯露的英外長貝文</h3>
<p>戰後歐洲最重要的會議—四強外長會議已於廿三日在巴黎揭幕，參加此一會議的四外長之中，鋒芒最顯露的就是英外長貝文（Ernest　Bevin，1881—），他現在是英國下院和整個英國社會裏的一位非常重要的人物，可是在九年之前，當他在五十七歲的時候却還未直接參加到政治的圈子裏去，更談不上做什麽部長或國會議員之類。</p>
<p>他本來投身於工會運動，是邱吉爾首相一手把他提拔到內閣裏來並在國會裏安挿了一個位置。當他初任勞工部長的時候，英國正在忙着動員戰爭，由於他對於所任的工作有着充分的認識，部屬對他的忠誠是無可比擬的。他是邱吉爾首相的親近的合作者。到一九四五年開始任外相職。那時他對於外交一項已有透澈的認識和熟練的技巧，在國會裏已能應付裕如，對於一般社會也有很貼切的接觸。所以可說不需要「怕」任何人了。</p>
<p>說起貝文的出身是很可憐的。他是一個窮家子，並且當他在未滿八歲的時候，父母已經亡故。當他在十一歲時，他獨自跑到布列斯德，在一家飯店裏當了僕役。後來又做過鐵路上的護送員，伙食店的助手和司機等。因為當了司機，就開始和布列斯德船塢的工人們有了聯絡，這時他就參加了船塢工會的司機組。從這時起他就真正參加了工會運動。</p>
<p>一九二〇年，他在運輸工人問訊處裏發表了他的著名的十一小時演說，結果替船塢工人爭取到一個固定的給薪最低的標準。這樣他就獲得了「船塢工人的的辯護律師」的尊稱。到一九三六年九月，他被選為工會大會的理事會主席。第二年仍繼任此職。在一九四〇年五月他當了勞工部長，同年十月，他參加了戰時內閣。</p>
<p>從一九四五年開始，貝文就任了外相。世界上有少數出身清苦的偉人，在金錢和教育兩方面都比不上中等階級，然而憑着一己的努力終於得到萬世流芳的成就。貝文就是其中的一個。</p>
<h3>放眼看西康</h3>
<p>— 王稼琪</p>
<p>〔康定訊〕自康定向西走，爬過拔海四千公尺的高山，會發現一個另外的世界，那一望萬里無垠的草原，中間也託跡有稀疏的丘陵，放眼處盡是一片綠色的大荒，立時會使你的眼界新鮮廣闊了。黨溫暖的太陽普照着大地的時候，這一塊甯靜的像北極圈裏的冰島一樣的邊疆，正充滿着極濃厚的宗教氣氛。平原上一重重用花崗嚴建築的高聳樓閣，遠遠看去有點像西洋建築，成羣閒散的牛羊，高健樸實的牧者，大有古希臘的風情。</p>
<p>保持中國禮讓</p>
<p>西康省內的住民大部為藏人，他們雖然不注意物質的文明生活，但他們對於居室建築，刺繡，佛像，壁畫，浮雕，服飾，以及用具裝飾的精緻絕倫，却並不比我們內地落後。在社會方面，他們保留着古代中禮讓的風度，且多俠義的舉動，他們比今日的漢人更重視禮貌，這可以從獻「哈帶」看出來，所謂「哈帶」就是「喜紗」的意思，與古人「獻帛」的通理相同，禮節分鞠躬，叩頭，吐舌，等幾種形式外還有碰頭的禮儀，這與西洋人的接吻一樣，含有着親密的意思，男女社交，頗有歐美的風味，他們男女的交際，絕對公開自由，沒有任何封建的拘束。男女的正式結合，禮制也非常隆重而有趣，婚禮各地有各地不同的花樣，但情緒的表現却極有風趣。</p>
<p>喇嘛教盛行於境內，因為住在這裏的是藏族人，他們的生活，也和這大自然一樣地幽美甯靜，他們全都篤信宗教，崇拜喇嘛，家有一子，必送至喇嘛寺，有三子者必送其二，你能說這是一件愚蠢的事情嗎？他們的心靈裏認為這是多麼神聖榮幸的，他們的信仰喇嘛，與西洋人的信奉基督教是同樣的不可思議。</p>
<p>特殊氏族雜居</p>
<p>在道孚及甘孜境內，金礦的蘊藏極為豐富，隨地都可以看到土人挖掘的金洞，可惜缺乏新的探採工具和方法，把這無數寶貴的礦藏埋沒了！就是皮毛與藥材的產量也為西康主要的大宗出品，我們政府倘能積極地來開發西康，將是一筆無可限量的財富。</p>
<p>西康的工業近年來也有長足的進步，在雅安有省立的毛織廠，出品輸出於國內各省，製革廠還可以出產鞋皮，皮衣，紋皮等，製紙廠所出品的新聞紙會運銷至成都各地，規模與成效都相當可觀，此外還有木材廠與酒精廠等，都著有很好的成績。</p>
<p>向西康南徙的蒙古人完全被藏回所同化，留在「霍爾章」地方，沒有隨大部向南發展的蒙古人，已經同化於東干回，但他們也和在鮮曲河畔的同支一樣只被同化了一半，他們住在蘭州臨夏之間的大夏河東岸屬臨夏縣管轄，距臨夏縣治僅廿餘里，以鎖南壩為中心，他們完全信奉回教，生活習慣，完全與回教無異，如果從男子的戴白帽，與女子的戴蓋頭及他們的篤守回教規看來，無疑地將使人確信他們是東干回人，這也可稱為西康境內的一部特殊民族。</p>
<p>農產不亞江南</p>
<p>在西康的邊緣，還有一個很陌生的地帶甯屬，雖然它也曾經有過一段燦爛歷史的回憶，但千百年來，甯屬是長期埋首在邊疆的萬山叢中，默默地引不起國人的注意，一直到了抗日戰爭的末期為着它地位的險要，與世界大勢的急轉，和國內戰局的推移，更隨着甯夏大動脈樂西，西祥公路的完成，它才變成了後方軍事政治的重要地帶，甯屬首邑的西昌，形成為西南邊緣軍政的中心，而和渝·昆·蓉·筑·並駕齊驅，成為大後方抗戰的柱石，因此可以看出它在西南國防上，產業上，交通上占着極大的重要性，尤其它擁有衆多的人口，蘊藏着無盡的礦產。就地理的形勢和國防上講，它對內是川·康·滇三省的疆牆，對外溝通了印度和緬甸，而成為國際交通綫的咽喉，甯屬本來是四川的一部，民國二十八年西康建立行省時，在「以川濟康」的原則下，才將它劃歸西康，而與雅麗同為西康最精華的一部。境內的住民大部是倮族人，此外更有漢族與西番族什居其間，甯屬的農產品並不遜於我國江南各省的富庶之區，為着氣候溫和，物產樣樣都有，就是　業一項，尤有極具希望的前途。</p>
<p>如何開發西康</p>
<p>在文化的觀點上，當然不能全以偏見讚美這種太趨於宗教式的文化，然而也不可抹煞它固有的優美地方，如像近年來的邊疆教育，總想把我們的一套灌輸到另一個不同口胃的民族裏面去，却忽略了人家固有的一套，因此，事倍而功無！</p>
<p>就西康整個的情形看，雖然他們物質文明遠不及其他各省，但精神文明則有其不可抹煞的偉大。今日我們絕不能再閉上眼睛說西康的藏人文化低，只能說他們的文化與我們的文化有點不同。他們也是大中華民族的細胞，今後應如何把這一大羣人的文化融合交流，如何把這一塊未開墾的處女地開發繁榮起來，這才是一件不容忽視的事。</p>
<h3>閩南械鬥內幕　（續）</h3>
<p>相傳清朝時曾有一個縣官用「殺以止殺」的手段，來制止械鬥，一下子殺了十餘個肇禍的人，於是那些好鬥者聞風變色，不敢再亂。可惜這類嚴官不多，多的倒是上任或械鬥醞釀發生之時，照例貼出一張嚴禁的佈告，隨後，不是閉着眼睛不管，便是裝硬裝軟，假聲假色，乘機會發一筆「械鬥財」，愚民窺準了官方的弱點，輕視了法律的力量，放心妄為，這種姑息養禍的辦法，是助長械鬥風熾的原因之一。</p>
<p>械鬥發生後，照例公親出來奔走調解，卽使控制官裏，或官方自動出來查究拏人，但結果每一起都由公親息事銷案。做公親的這種人，大多是「扇子」人物（善煽動者），劣紳，衙門梭之流，他們一做了械鬥公親，不但雙方要送草鞋費，活動費，答酬金，而且無論到那一方，都可享受竭誠的恭奉，經常是大菜，大肉，老酒，鴉片，麻將，妓女……因為甜頭大，享福多，所以他們幾乎成爲了「職業公親」，對於每一件械鬥，不但希望他們曠日持久，或越弄越大，甚至無風生浪，或小題大做，故意挑撥，這種人名以為公親，實是罪人，械鬥不能滅絕，他們應負一部責任。</p>
<p>械鬥是以殺人為目的的一種勾當，但也是一種花錢的勾當。錢於械鬥的重要不下於人丁，丁壯多所以敢械鬥，同時假如錢多，也可以放心發動械鬥。武器裝備要錢，應付公親要錢，撫卹傷亡要錢，雇人坐牢要錢，疏通官府要錢，……而且為要殺人也須預備一筆巨大的「人命錢」。錢實是械鬥勝利的保證。閩南因為洋客多，僑匯多，好械鬥的人多這樣想：「犯國法以國幣應之，錢花人無事，幹下去有什麽要緊！」每當械鬥發生，一面在鄉中大事派款（其實這也大部份是僑匯），一面電南洋的鄉親告急，在他們心中：「我們在鄉的出力賣命，你們在外的出錢是應該的。」而洋客因為鄉土觀念濃厚，不忍故鄉吃虧，也就常常有求必應，這樣「番客錢」就和「東西佛」成為械鬥的左右臂。</p>
<p>械鬥死灰復燃</p>
<p>抗戰初期，閩南的駐軍旅長錢東亮是個硬漢子，他維持社會治安，一向採取「治亂世用重典」的辦法，有回晋江「東西佛」醞釀鬥端，結果全縣神廟的大小偶像都給他集中燒燬，對於械鬥，亦有「殺無赦」的告誡。那個時候人民愛國情緒高揚，比較不着眼於小我之爭。再接着是僑匯斷絕，物價狂漲，社會普遍貧窮化，械鬥沒有了油，自然燃不起火來。</p>
<p>可是勝利以後，械鬥又「死灰復燃」了。這當然也自有原因。</p>
<p>一，八年的戰時生活，實在太苦悶了。現在喘過一口氣來，大家有心情來回憶過去，於是鼠雀細故的仇恨，以及戰時積累的糾紛都得到集會，想通過械鬥以小題大做一番。</p>
<p>二，僑匯暢通了，生活比較安定，械鬥亦不乏資本。而迎神賽會風盛，東西佛糾紛，機會也就多了。</p>
<p>三，歸僑帶來不少的美國武器，這些東西都是掛在壁上的好琵琶，不彈彈奏奏，心有不甘，拿來打魚獵鳥或朝天空放，實在過不了　，於是不能不找個機會來表演與顯露一下，而好鬥的英雄們對於這些武器，尤覺有恃無恐，發動械鬥就更有了信心。</p>
<p>南安　州鎮燕山保傅黃二姓，因為牧童越界牧牛，由糾紛發生械鬥，雙方借槍，挖戰溝，分帖各向宗村及盟村求援，一度開火，槍聲歷歷，傅姓且因為自製炸彈不慎爆炸，創傷了兩個人。</p>
<p>晋江南郊的潘湖和舊舖兩村，也爲了牧牛無意踏傷一點農作物，釀成械鬥，幾次消熄了又為細故死灰復燃，截途捕人毆人之事疊見，最後一次且牽動了「東西佛」大小十餘村，殺氣騰騰，局勢汹汹，南郊一帶交通斷絕，直到專員和縣長聞訊帶大批縣自衛隊和警察趕下鄉去，才壓制下來。</p>
<p>晋江石獅區蔣吳二姓因為開鑿墓石，認為有傷「風水」而失和，不但牽動了整個晋南的蔣姓吳姓及「東西佛」，甚至鄰縣南的吳姓也派代表參加，鬧得「滿城風雨」，最緊張的日子，連石獅街的商店樓上也被架上機關槍，真是恐怖萬分，一觸卽發，幸當局派員派　當地鎮壓，勸　，才鳴鑼息爭，沒弄出大亂子來。</p>
<p>惠安洛陽鎮張王兩姓，因為遷葬祖墳引起越界佔地的爭執，也由列械毀墓而醞釀戰鬥，後來政府派隊到地抓了幾個人，鬥氣才由此消戢。</p>
<p>同安蘇陳二姓亦因修建宗祠認為傷礙「風水」，屢生械鬥，月前事態擴大，牽連四五鄉鎮，動員丁壯進萬，大事備戰，甚至專員公署派　前往鎮壓時，鄉民的步哨反向官兵大喊口令，阻止前進；弄得整個同安草木皆兵，洽安當局恐奸匪乘機擾亂，實行晚間戒嚴，並派警督促商店提早歇市，這種狀態在當局積極處理之下，費時半月，才得平息。</p>
<p>放牛，墓地，宗祠，「風水」，這一些極小或極無謂的事情，竟然會掀動械鬥，以流血殺人的手段來解決，怎不令人啼笑皆非！</p>
<h3>民歌實驗室　穗星社演奏記</h3>
<p>— 陳曙風</p>
<p>〔廣州訊〕民歌這火星，初期是由抗戰而燃燒起來的。這以前，由於夏利賓的提倡，中國樂壇漸有中國風的曲子出現。不過那時所謂中國風的東西，多半是指用五聲音階來作曲便算是中國風。屬於那時的作品劉雪　寫的最多，如「飄零的落花」，「春夜洛城聲笛」等是，但那時的中國風的曲子，除了用五音之外（雖然聞笛一曲有第七音）根本所用的音階還是西洋大音階小音階的觀念。樂曲的終止仍終止在大音階的主音上，還未敢用　Re　調式寫東西，或其他調式寫東西，所以前期所寫東西，聽起來雖有點像中國的曲子，但還不夠道地，或可說只像是文人很姍雅的吟詠。「聞笛」便是此一風格。</p>
<p>同時節奏當然也算在內。黃今吾之「玫瑰三願」，「農家樂」雪廳之「飄零的落花」，「春夜洛城聞笛」，根本是西洋節奏，所以聽起來，中國味便給冲淡了。</p>
<p>這個時期過了之後，抗戰來了，民歌在大衆中起了爆炸作用了，又可說再度開花了，「蘆溝問答」用小放牛調（田從配調）「秦瓊訪友」（田從詞）用梨膏糖調，流傳得很快，於是發掘的工作，掘得更深，抗戰到了第三年（二十八年）廣西的歌「石榴青」也給記譜了。這些來到中國的樂壇當然像新鮮的果子。裝滿了鮮甜的果汁。</p>
<p>民歌上音樂會</p>
<p>但抗戰勝利以前，民歌還只是政治工作隊在宣傳時用者居多。到了將近勝利的那年，一些離經叛道的聲樂學生拿民歌來研究（那還是音樂院與音分院在青木關時代）那時教授們倒對民歌沒有發生什麽興趣，大約聲樂教授們的「心耳」為歌劇之類的音響所充滿，民歌的音響之美，他們還沒有發現，及至有一回開民歌演唱會，幾乎每個歌曲受到歡迎，都請再唱。聲樂教授們於是纔注意起民歌來了，以後學生們又開了許多歌唱法的坐談會，慢慢找尋自己民族形式的唱法，前回黃源尹在西北是他自己去發掘唱法工作之一。（未完）</p>

<h3>定額本票回籠　國行昨起收兌</h3>

<h3>人心虛·買賣稀　黃金市况回跌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲，因當局壓力重重，各方不無戒意，均不敢妄動，大多字號，因風聲頗緊，暫停買賣，惟塲內因無塲外價格，距離甚遠，照例掛高至百一十四億六千六百二十萬漲停板，有行無市。塲外交易，延遲至十時光景，方才做開。初喊二二〇億，二五〇億，未有成交。霎時連低三檔，迨十時一刻，卽告退入二百億大關，小至一九〇億，二二〇億。頻午因聞央行又將拋售，人心虛軟，在一片賣出聲中，最低曾降至一三〇億，一六〇億，午收稍升至一六〇億，一九〇億。午後供多求少，再小至一五〇億，一八〇億收盤。較上週末回跌五〇億。</p>

<h3>全體市民一致奮起　努力打到無形敵人　市長播講擴大清潔運動意義</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕陳市長於昨日下午六時，在上海電台對全市市民廣播，題為「擴大清潔運動的意義」，茲錄廣播詞全文如後：</p>
<p>諸位同胞：上海保衛戰已進入第二旬，在此時此地，倡導清潔運動意義非常重大，我們知道，無形的敵人和有形的敵人，一樣要打倒的，在我們軍民合作的情形下，打倒有形的敵人是很有把握的，但另外還有一個肉眼看不見的無形敵人，就是病菌，牠同樣的可以摧毀我們的生命財產，所以我們必須打倒牠，消滅牠，因此，這次擴大清潔運動，無疑義的是保衛大上海的一部份。希望我六百萬市民全體努力參加，使與戰事上的殺敵致果配合，得到偉大的成功。上，佔世界大都市的第四位，是我國工商業的中心海目前地位，更為重要，但因人烟過於稠密，一部份市民尚未養成公共衛生的習慣，以致就清潔方面而言，尚未能與各國大都市媲美。每年一近夏季，病菌　生，尤易引起疫病，市民生命，受到重大的威脅。據統計數字，有時死於疾疫者，比較死於戰塲者為多，稱之為無形的敵人，實不為過。病菌的產生，是由於飲料食物及空氣環境的不清潔，而最重要的原因，尤在於垃圾糞便及污水的不善處理。上海人口號稱六百萬，每日垃圾卽達三千多噸，加以抗戰期間，敵偽掃而不運的垃圾，堆積更多。勝利以後，雖然花了許多經費，清除了宿積垃圾六十餘萬噸，但以人力物力財力以及蘇州河交通不便種種原因，清除工作，終難達到預定的理想。此後舉行擴大清潔運動，首一目標要清潔這病菌大本營的垃圾。此事體大，必須全體市民，通力合作，共同努力，始能完成任務。次一目標，要人人注意一人一家的衛生，更要注意公共的衛生，養成良好的清潔習慣。因一人的不潔，危害大多數人的生命，其罪惡是不可寬恕的。總之：這次擴大清潔運動的目的，是希望我全體市民一致奮起撲滅我們無形的敵人，市政府自當盡一切可能，共同努力，除　成衛生局，警察局，民政局，工務局，並透過保甲長發動大規模的清除之外，還需要全體市民自動的持久的注意清潔衛生以期達到我們預定的希望，清潔是獲得健康的必要條件，健康是人們的最大財富，人人應該爭取的。同胞們，努力吧，努力打倒有形的敵人，並且努力打倒無形的敵人，努力爭取勝利，努力爭取健康，最後敬祝諸位康樂。</p>

<h3>Naval and Air Forces Assist in the Offensive: Pudong Battles Gradually Reach a Climax; National Army Advances on Three Major Fronts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Navy Headquarters News: Our Navy's X Fleet (23rd) launched a fierce attack in the morning, cooperating with the Army to intercept the bandit army attacking Gaoqiao. The bandit army at important strongholds on the left and right wings of Gaoqiao, such as Chenjiaqiao and Yangjiazhai, were completely defeated. Our Army is taking advantage of the momentum to launch a fierce attack. After our Navy assisted the Army in fiercely attacking the above-mentioned strongholds, it also blocked the bandits' retreat. In this battle, our XX ship Captain Chen Qingkun and XX ship Captain Qiu Zhongming both used blitzkrieg tactics, using the most effective firepower to carry out destructive firing on the bandits at extremely close range to the river bank. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and retreated along the above-mentioned strongholds.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: On the 23rd, fierce battles took place throughout the Pudong district of Shanghai. In the morning, due to low clouds and rain, the activities of most of the naval air force were severely restricted. In the afternoon, the clouds were high and the weather cleared, and a large number of aircraft flew to the line of Gaoqiao, Yangjing, and Tangqiao in Pudong to assist the Army in its offensive. The stubborn bandits were immediately suppressed by us, and by evening, our army had achieved the expected progress on the above three major fronts.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: (1) On the Gaoqiao front in Pudong, at 11:00 am on the 23rd, after our attacking troops successively captured Chenjiadang, the right wing went straight to the line of Yinjiaqiao, Zhongzhai, Lujiazhai, and Chenjiadang. The left wing is still engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in Chenwang Sanzhai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News at 9:30 am on the 23rd: (1) In the Pudong area, after two days of heroic counterattacks by the defending troops and the continuous arrival of reinforcements from our XX and other units to the front line, the battle has gradually reached a climax. At around 1:00 am on the 23rd, our main defense zone east of Lujiazhao and Yangjing Town resumed fierce fighting. More than 3,000 bandits, braving the blazing firepower, launched a fierce attack on us in the dark, dividing their forces. After three hours of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered hundreds of casualties. By dawn, the remaining bandits had all entered our pre-arranged pocket formation and are currently being encircled and annihilated by our army. (2) In the Battle of Gaoqiao, after our XX unit of reinforcements, in coordination with the local garrison, inflicted heavy losses on the bandits, the area has become the largest graveyard for the bandits attacking Pudong. The main force of the bandit's 30th Army has been almost completely lost after two days of fighting. Their subsequent units, the 31st, 20th, and 33rd armies, successively reinforced on the 22nd and 23rd, and drove many innocent civilians to act as human shields. However, due to the joint operations of our army, navy, and air force, the bandits' dream of swallowing this important stronghold in Pudong in an attempt to cut off our Songhu (Shanghai-Wusong) lifeline had to be shattered. By around 7:00 am on the 23rd, a certain unit of our defending troops had switched to an active offensive, and simultaneously launched attacks in multiple directions. The battle is still in progress.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: Telephone from Pudong at 12:00 noon on the 23rd: (1) From 9:00 pm on the 22nd, the bandits concentrated all their strength from the 29th, 30th, and 31st armies, as well as the Beihai, Nanjing, and Shanghai Columns, and the Zhejiang Brigade, and launched an attack on our army's positions in the direction of Huangjiazhai, Yangjing Town, Dajinzhai, and Longzheng Temple. The fighting was particularly fierce in the Dajinzhai area. (2) A group of bandits who sneaked into Dajinzhai, Huangjiazhai, and other places on the night of the 22nd took advantage of the dimness of the night to sneak into the positions of one of our units. Our mobile unit counter-encircled the bandits, putting them in a dilemma, and used fierce firepower to sandwich them, annihilating all the bandits who had sneaked into our positions, leaving more than 400 corpses behind and fleeing in a panic. Another group of bandits launched a foolish attack on our Tangqiao positions from the right wing, but were also repelled by our army's fierce firepower. The bandits, out of desperation, adopted their self-proclaimed triumphant human wave tactics, launching a full-scale wave charge on us. The fierce fighting continued until 12:00 noon yesterday, and was still taking place fiercely in the Dajinzhai and other areas. (3) Luo, the commander of our garrison in the Dajinzhai and Tangqiao area, personally went to the front line to supervise the battle in order to encourage his comrades to bravely annihilate the bandits, and decided not to easily give up the opportunity to kill the enemy. It is said that the bandits are now being encircled and annihilated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: Telephone from the front line at 8:00 am on the 23rd, summarizing the battle results: After the bandit army's attack on the area north of the Yunzaobang to the Yangtze River was crushed, they regrouped the forces of four armies to attack Pudong, attempting to cross Gaoqiao and cut off the Wusong lifeline. For five days, the bandits rushed around like wild boars, and their arrogance was quite high. After our army, navy, and air force respectively inflicted heavy blows on them, they are now blocked in the area between Yangjing and Gaoqiao. Under the pressure of our various strong firepowers, more than 20,000 bandits have been annihilated. The remnants of each division of their 30th and 31st armies are less than a regiment in number. After making one last, largest struggle in the past two days, they are no longer able to attack. The battles on that line have now come to a standstill. On the eleventh day of the Battle of Shanghai, the bandits' second key point of attack was again broken, and our army is becoming more and more courageous in battle, and our confidence is becoming more and more firm. It is obvious that the foundation for defending Shanghai has been laid.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Yuepu and Liuhang Line; Garrison Troops in Southern Shanghai Launch Annihilation Offensive; Communist Army Fails to Capture Jinjiazhai in Nanxiang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: (1) More than 2,000 bandits in Xiluqiao and Wuzhai, southwest of Yuepu, began to attack our garrison's positions at 5:30 pm on the 23rd. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of our garrison, holding the spirit of "I will not coexist with bandits, and if there are bandits, there will be no me," heroically counterattacked. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. As of the time of this dispatch, the two sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. (2) At 8:10 pm on the 23rd, the garrison troops in Laozhai, east of Liuhang and southwest of Yanghang, engaged in fierce fighting with the invading bandits. The rumbling artillery fire heard from the outskirts of Shanghai at dusk was said to have been fired by our army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] On the line from Liuhang and Yanghang to Yuepu, our army continued to send out strong troops to launch attacks in multiple directions on the 23rd in order to maintain the initiative. The bandit army was like a frightened bird and rarely resisted stubbornly. Therefore, there were only small local contacts throughout the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Telephone from the Yuepu front at 9:00 am on the 23rd: The bandits in the Yuepu, Yanghang, Liuhang, and other positions have been heavily hit by us for days, are exhausted, and no longer have the ability to fight. It is judged that their remnants may be adjusted and replenished in an attempt to attack again. Therefore, the battle situation has been very quiet in recent days, except for minor contacts. The entire night of the 22nd was also like a state of rest. Our garrison is currently taking advantage of the rare spare time to raise their vigilance, strengthen their fortifications, and review the gains and losses of this operation in order to prepare to attack the bandit remnants and inflict a fatal blow on them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: The bandits in the southern Shanghai area returned in force on the afternoon of the 23rd. The fighting was quite fierce for a time on the line of Xinqiao, Qibao, and Lujia Lane. However, according to reliable reports, the combat effectiveness of the bandit army on this line is not worth paying attention to. Its strategic significance is probably to echo the offensives in Pudong and northwestern Shanghai. The garrison there had made strong preparations early on and is currently launching an annihilation attack on the four regiments of invading bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News at 9:30 am on the 23rd: After our advancing stronghold in Qibao, southwestern Shanghai, was actively evacuated by the garrison at considerable cost, the bandits were lured to the front of our main position, and with artillery and air cover, we concentrated our firepower to counterattack. In the afternoon of the 22nd, our tank unit was ordered to reinforce. The bandits, suffering heavy casualties, scurried back towards Qibao and are currently under our strict encirclement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: Telephone from the Luhang front at 6:00 pm on the 23rd: A group of about 200 bandits from Nanxiang attacked the positions of a certain unit of our army in Jinjiazhai at 1:30 am on the 23rd, taking advantage of the darkness of the night. We lured them to the vicinity of Luzhai and then unleashed all our firepower, giving the bandits a head-on blow. The fierce fighting continued until about 4:00 am. The bandits gradually felt overwhelmed. We seized the opportunity and immediately dispatched elite garrison troops, with one unit flanking the bandits from the left wing. The bandits were attacked on both sides and were immediately thrown into confusion. We took advantage of the victory to break into the bandit formation and inflict a heavy blow on them. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, with corpses piled up everywhere. The remaining bandits fled in panic. In this battle, more than 100 bandits were killed, 13 were captured alive, and 12 submachine guns and more than 100 rifles were seized. Only five of our officers and soldiers were injured, and the position remained secure.</p>
<h3>Garrison Troops' Fighting Spirit Demonstrates Inherent Martial Virtues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: In the past eleven days of combat, our garrison troops have demonstrated a high degree of fighting spirit and displayed the inherent martial virtues of soldiers. For example, the position of a certain company west of Yuepu was once captured by the bandits. After a heroic battle, all the officers and soldiers of the company sacrificed themselves heroically, and no one retreated. The position was recaptured by our counterattack one hour later. Also, when the position west of Yanghang was captured by the bandits, the officers and soldiers of a certain company guarding the area vowed to coexist and die with the position, persisting to the last man and the last bullet. Later, reinforcements arrived to counterattack, and the entire group of bandits was annihilated. Furthermore, when the forward stronghold south of Gaoqiao was captured by the bandits, a certain company commander of ours resolved not to coexist with the bandits and defended it until the last minute. All the brothers in the company died for the country, and he also committed suicide to achieve benevolence. Under the power jointly exerted by the national army, navy, and air force, the bandit army uses the backward and brutal human wave charge tactic, not hesitating to use human lives as human shields, but the sacrifice is great and the success is small (the ratio of bandit to our casualties is ten to one). Their soldiers are extremely weary of war and afraid of war. Those who sneak into our pocket formations are mostly willing to lay down their weapons and surrender to the national army.</p>
<h3>Radio Fundraising to Comfort the Troops; All Circles Actively Contribute</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday was the second day of the radio fundraising campaign launched by the City Comfort Committee to comfort the troops. In addition to the participation of Weiyang Opera, ballad singers Fan Xueping, Zhu Shuizhao, Yuan Xuefen, Xu Yulan, etc., there were also broadcasts by Gu Zhenggang, Standing Committee Member of the Political Affairs Committee, Mayor Chen, Commander Chen's representative Zhang Taixiang, and Li Dasan, Chairman of the Special Party Department of the Two Routes, etc., to promote the significance of raising funds to comfort the troops. Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Comfort Committee, personally presided over and made a second appeal for fundraising broadcasts, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. As of noon yesterday, the association had received donations of nearly 1,000 silver dollars, 300 US dollars, 2 billion gold yuan, 3 mace of gold, 50 dozen towels, 300 cartons of cigarettes, 40 dozen socks, and Zhengyi Barber Shop on Haining Road donated one day's income, which is very commendable.

In addition, the association will continue to entrust various radio stations to continue reporting and raising funds to comfort the troops from today onwards. It is hoped that enthusiastic patriotic people from all walks of life will actively donate. The locations for delivering funds and materials are advertised in major newspapers.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhenggang's Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Gu Zhenggang, Member of the Political Affairs Committee of the Jinghu Hang Garrison Headquarters, broadcast to the citizens of the city yesterday to promote fundraising to comfort the troops, entitled "Encourage Morale with Popular Sentiment." The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Fellow citizens of Shanghai! In this Great Shanghai Defense War, the invading Communist bandits in Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, Liuhang, and Qibao in western Shanghai, and Gaoqiao in Pudong, have encountered the heroic and firm resistance of our front-line soldiers everywhere, and none of them have been able to escape the annihilation of our front-line soldiers' predetermined fire nets. In the past ten days, the casualties of the main force of the Communist bandits have reached more than 50,000, and more than 3,000 Communist bandits have been captured, and more than 250 light and heavy machine guns of the Communist bandits have been seized, as well as many other spoils of war. The Communist bandits' crazy offensive has suffered a serious blow. This heroic spirit and brilliant record of the National Army have made this anti-aggression, anti-violence, and striving for national independence and the people's freedom of life in the Shanghai Defense War exert its great significance and supreme value in the international community and in history.</p>
<p>We must expand the fruits of this victory to defeat the Communist bandits and eliminate the Communist bandits. We must have not only heroic morale, but also vigorous popular sentiment. Whether soldiers or people, we should all recognize the significance of the nation above all else and the military above all else, with the goal of victory first, and encourage morale with popular sentiment, and inspire popular sentiment with morale, so that popular sentiment and morale can communicate, share the same hatred, and bravely strive forward. This is the performance of our great national spirit and democratic strength, and it is also the support force for our victory in suppressing bandits and the solid foundation for our victory in suppressing bandits.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to sincerely call on the people of Shanghai to emulate the contributions of the people of European and American countries to the front-line soldiers. Our fellow compatriots from all walks of life should also do their best to do everything for the front line and everything for victory. Now the soldiers are using their flesh and blood to defend our country, defend our Shanghai, and protect our lives and property. This spirit is so great and worthy of our respect.</p>
<p>I now want to call on the people of all walks of life in Shanghai to be aware of the meaning of "risking your life to protect your life" and "losing your property to protect your property," and to work hard to make the following contributions in the spirit of "those who have money contribute money" and "those who have strength contribute strength":</p>
<p>(1) Fellow compatriots who have assets, such as factory owners, real estate owners, managers of companies, firms, banks, and money houses, and people who hold money, foreign currency, and the middle class, should donate more.</p>
<p>(2) Fellow compatriots who have skills, such as singing, drama, music, art, and other people with expertise, should perform art and raise money and materials to be used to comfort the soldiers, or offer art to the soldiers to appreciate, so that the soldiers can get spiritual comfort after a hundred battles.</p>
<p>(3) Intellectuals and young fellow compatriots should use words or speeches to elaborate the meaning of suppressing bandits, to inspire popular sentiment, or write letters to comfort the soldiers, to encourage morale.</p>
<p>(5) In addition to being able to do the above-mentioned tasks, female fellow compatriots should donate shoes, wash clothes, and do rescue work for the wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned contributions are the performance of our Shanghai compatriots' love for the country and freedom, and they are also the performance of our Shanghai compatriots' popular sentiment. I hope that our Shanghai compatriots will promote our popular sentiment to cooperate with the heroic morale, to strive for the victory of this defense war.</p>
<h3>Mayor Chen's Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Mayor Chen broadcasted on Shanghai Radio at 6:10 pm yesterday (23rd) to promote the fundraising campaign to comfort the troops. The full text of the broadcast speech is excerpted below: Fellow compatriots: In order to protect the safety of the lives and property of six million citizens, in order to protect five thousand years of inherent culture, and to strive for the independence and freedom of the motherland, in order to uphold justice and maintain world peace, in short, whether for ourselves, for the nation, or for the world, we must resolutely, with one heart, and do everything possible to jointly participate in the work of defending Great Shanghai.</p>
<p>Counting from the beginning of the Shanghai Defense War, it has entered its second ten days today. For more than ten days, our strong army, great air force, and navy that dominates East Asia have all fought bravely together with the spirit of having me without an enemy, regardless of rain or shine, day or night, braving the harsh weather, braving the hail of bullets, and gloriously killing the enemy. Sometimes, for the sake of a little bit of contention, we do not hesitate to take the lead in fighting, and fight bloody battles. In the minds of the general officers and soldiers, there is only success, not failure. Even if they break their arms and legs, they must heal their wounds and fight again, and those who must return to the hospital for treatment will immediately go to the front line again after they recover, fulfilling their duty to protect the country and the people. This earth-shattering, tear-jerking, indomitable, and commendable fact of loyalty and courage can be said to be the development and promotion of the spirit of sacrifice and struggle during the Xinhai Revolution and the War of Resistance Against Japan. It is expected that it will continue to exert great power, eliminate the enemy, and return our freedom, and the time should not be far away.</p>
<p>However, military-civilian cooperation is a necessary condition for victory. All the officers and soldiers of our army, navy, and air force have fulfilled their mission of killing the enemy on the front line. All six million citizens should jointly participate in the sacred work of defending Great Shanghai. Under the principle of contributing strength if there is strength and contributing money if there is money, we must do our best to raise, donate, transport, and supply the supplies necessary for the combat of all officers and soldiers, as well as the supplies necessary for the life and medical care of all officers and soldiers. Furthermore, under the principle of everything for the front line and everything for victory, it is not an exaggeration to unconditionally contribute all our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to the front line. There is no distinction between workers, farmers, businessmen, or students, and there is no distinction between men, women, old, or young. Everyone has a share in defending Great Shanghai, and everyone has a responsibility, and everyone's aspirations can become a city.</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, losing property can protect property, and risking your life can protect your life. Now is the time for the people in the rear to lose property to defend their homes and themselves. I deeply hope that all citizens will raise and donate everything, sacrifice everything, and work together to defend Great Shanghai. Finally, I wish you all good health.</p>
<h3>Fang Zhi's Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Fang Zhi, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, broadcasted to the citizens of this city yesterday to promote the fundraising campaign to comfort the troops, entitled "The Communist Bandits' Attack on Shanghai Has Failed." The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Yesterday, my brother made a broadcast to the city to report that "the Communist bandits dug their own graves in Shanghai," and reported the situation of the Communist bandits' disastrous defeat. Today, I am even more excited to tell you that the Communist bandits' offensives in Pudong and Liuhang Yanghang have now completely collapsed.</p>
<p>The strength of the Communist bandits is really nothing remarkable. The achievements in Pudong, after two days of heroic counterattacks by our army and the reinforcements of our XX and other units to the front line, the battle entered its climax. In particular, the Battle of Gaoqiao gave the attacking bandits the greatest blow. It can be said that most of the main force of the bandits' 30th Army has been lost. The bandits' dream of swallowing this important stronghold in Pudong in an attempt to cut off our Songhu lifeline had to be shattered. Now I can report to you that the casualties of the Communist bandits have increased from 50,000 to 70,000, and the number of prisoners has increased from 3,000 to 5,000. Tonight, I believe we can achieve great results. These glorious and great victories are all due to the enthusiasm of the people from all walks of life in Shanghai to comfort the soldiers. The front-line soldiers, with the enthusiastic support of our city's compatriots, have made them encouraged and happy, and have strengthened their brave spirit in combat. What is especially valuable is that some innocent children take their saved candy money to comfort the troops, and there are also some enthusiastic "anonymous people" who only want to donate money and do not want to leave their names. They have donated many materials and funds, which is really very commendable. And what is most worthy of our praise is that friendly people also generously donated money enthusiastically, which shows that the interests of this Shanghai Defense War are not only in maintaining the freedom, property, life and happiness of Shanghai citizens, but also that international people are giving it great sympathy.</p>
<p>Under the major premise that everything is for the front line, everything is for the soldiers, and everything is for suppressing bandits, the enthusiastic labor army performance of our rear personnel is deeply moving the hearts of the brave soldiers fighting on the front line. When we went to comfort the troops, their simple and powerful response to the people in the rear was only one sentence, that is, to "annihilate more bandits to repay the enthusiasm of the citizens of Shanghai." How can we not be encouraged and happy when we hear it? I believe that the Shanghai citizens who love freedom and love the country will show more and greater enthusiasm to continue to comfort the soldiers in order to repay their spirit of bravely killing the enemy for the country.</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, starting from today, we are preparing to organize a committee to specifically handle and distribute the funds and goods raised for this army of labor. I hope that our six million compatriots in the city will mobilize unanimously and participate in this comfort movement more actively and in unity. Now, when we receive the continuous good news from the front line amidst the rumbling of cannons, we know that the Communist bandits' attack on Shanghai has failed.</p>

<h3>Tokyo American Naval Spokesman Denies Sending Troops to Qingdao; MacArthur's Spokesman Also Denies Equipping Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 23rd] The Chinese Communists on the 23rd accused the U.S. government of repeatedly sending "warships, aircraft, and troops" to Qingdao to assist the Nationalist forces, but this was directly denied by American naval officials here.

<h3>Jinghu-Hangzhou Headquarters Issues Letter to Army, Navy, and Air Force Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Political Warfare Department of the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters has recently issued a letter to the army, navy, and air force officers and soldiers in the Songhu area for the defense of Shanghai. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>To all brave officers and soldiers,</p>
<p>The defense of the great city of Shanghai, which has attracted worldwide attention, has already begun. We are extremely excited and overjoyed. We are excited that we are the ones defending this anti-communist base of China, and we are overjoyed that we are the ones defending this democratic fortress of the world. This is the best opportunity for us to demonstrate our skills and serve the country. Our highest authorities have a firm will to defend Shanghai, and our commander-in-chief has an all-encompassing plan to defend Shanghai. For the sake of the independence and survival of our nation, and to avoid the tragedy of national subjugation, for the free way of life of our 450 million compatriots, and to avoid becoming cannon fodder in a third world war, and even more for the safety of our lives, families, wives, and children, and to avoid enslavement and dismemberment, we must fight these red traitorous Soviet dogs to the death!</p>
<p>Comrades! Our will is firm, unwavering, and unyielding. Our integrity is steadfast, unchanging, and non-surrendering. Our military virtue is upright, not greedy for wealth and not afraid of death. In the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, democracy and totalitarianism, freedom and unfreedom, we are not alone.

We have the sincere support of the 6 million compatriots in Shanghai and the vast majority of peace-loving and democratic people in China. We also have millions of loyal and brave comrades in the army, navy, and air force who have experienced hundreds of battles. Under the wise leadership of Commander-in-Chief Tang, we must, and we certainly can, fight well, defend firmly, and hold tightly, making Shanghai a base for revitalizing the nation and rebuilding the country, thereby recovering Nanjing, restoring the Central Plains, liberating the Northeast, eliminating the bandits, and celebrating victory!</p>
<p>In these past few days of fierce fighting, we have fully demonstrated the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers, dealing a heavy blow to the arrogant and shameless bandits who have insulted our national army to the point of being utterly disgraced. We have made these red traitors taste the flavor of the national army's incomparably strong iron fist.</p>
<p>Comrades, let us work hard! Victory is based on struggle, glory comes from sacrifice, and success requires progress. We must all strive harder, uphold righteousness for the nation, fight for the dignity of the country, wash away the shame of the country, and avenge the blood of the martyrs!</p>
<h3>Qingbai Guard to Undergo Intensive Training Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Qingdao, 23rd] Qingdao's 20,000-strong self-defense force will soon undergo intensive training.

<h3>Regarding the Case of the Murder of Qiu Dingkun's Entire Family, Sheng Shicai Analyzes the Inside Story, Believing It Was a Robbery-Homicide with No Other Reasons</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Taipei, 23rd] Mr. Sheng Shicai, the former governor of Xinjiang Province and currently a general advisor to the Ministry of National Defense, believes that the murder of his brother-in-law Qiu Dingkun's entire family of eleven, including servants, was a robbery-homicide case. Mr. Sheng told the Central News Agency reporter exclusively on the morning of the 23rd: Qiu Dingkun arrived in Xinjiang three years after Sheng Shicai came to Xinjiang from the Northeast. He served as an instructor and deputy director of the Xinjiang Military Academy and is currently a major general advisor to the Northwest Military and Political Office. He had no enemies in normal times. The "twenty years of grievances settled in one night" written on the wall, according to normal reasoning, the criminals would not have had time to write this while committing the crime. It must have been written by the criminals' accomplices afterward to create a mysterious atmosphere in an attempt to cover up their robbery-homicide act. At the same time, it was a pre-emptive measure so that if they were arrested in the future, they could use revenge as an excuse to reduce their sentences. According to Sheng Shicai's judgment, this case is definitely not a political conspiracy. Sheng Shicai believes that one of the main culprits in this case must be the runaway Deputy Officer Qi. The planning of this case must have been a long-term, organized robbery group, and at least one-third of its members must be acquaintances who often visited Qiu's residence. Therefore, during the commission of the crime, they were afraid of being recognized by the servants and killed them all together. Sheng Shicai judged that Deputy Officer Qi must still be hiding in Lanzhou City or the nearby suburbs after committing the crime and has not yet fled. The stolen goods must also still be hidden in Lanzhou, and the hiding place must have been carefully selected in advance. Sheng Shicai said: Deputy Officer Qi is also from the Northeast and has been following Qiu Zongjun for eight years. He appears loyal on the surface, but his relatives and friends think that Qi is very cunning and have suggested replacing him. Sheng Shicai judged that after Qiu Dingkun returned home from watching a movie, Deputy Officer Qi must have immediately let the murderers into the house. Qiu's residence had three self-defense pistols, which must have been taken away by the criminals after being designed by them. Regarding Sheng Shicai's letter to his father-in-law Qiu Zongjun, according to Sheng Shicai, this letter was sent on May 5th. Because Taiyuan had already fallen, Sheng Shicai was deeply afraid that Qiu Zongjun and others would be trapped inside the Communist bandits' iron curtain in the future, and their lives and property would be difficult to protect. Therefore, he advised Qiu Zongjun to quickly fly to Taiwan or Guangzhou and Hong Kong to live. As for the phrase "must keep secret, do not love property, do not take cars" in the letter, it was because he was afraid of being ambushed by bandits on the way. Sheng Shicai also said: The US$40,000 that Qiu Dingkun deposited in a New York bank was remitted from Chongqing to the United States during the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, Qiu Dingkun's wife had kidney stones and planned to fly to the United States for surgery. Later, his wife had surgery in Lanzhou instead and did not go to the United States. The money has been stored until now. Sheng Shicai received a telegram from the Lanzhou Northeast Association on the 22nd regarding the report of this case. He immediately planned to telegraph Ma Bufang, commander of the Northwest Military and Political Office, and Guo Jiqiao, chairman of Gansu Province, to arrest the criminals and solve the case as soon as possible. Sheng Shicai arrived in Taiwan in January of this year and currently resides in Taipei with the fourteen guards who came with him from Xinjiang.</p>
<h3>Badger Arrives in Hong Kong to Discuss Evacuation of U.S. Nationals from South China</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong, 23rd] Vice Admiral Badger, commander of the U.S. Navy in the Western Pacific, arrived here aboard the flagship Eldorado on the morning of the 23rd. He will discuss the evacuation of U.S. nationals from South China with officials from the U.S. Embassy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Hong Kong, 23rd] The commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, Badger, arrived here today and immediately went to Guangzhou to convene U.S. consuls stationed in Hong Kong and Guangzhou to discuss the plan for evacuating U.S. nationals from South China. According to Mr. Hoppe, the U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong: The evacuation of U.S. nationals from Hong Kong may also be discussed. There are currently four to five hundred U.S. nationals scattered throughout South China. More than a dozen U.S. women and children from Kunming have recently evacuated here. Most of the U.S. nationals in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other places have accepted the advice of the U.S. consuls and gathered in Guangzhou to await evacuation, but some still remain in the interior.</p>
<h3>Young and Eleven Others Arrive in Pingtung for a Visit</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Kaohsiung, 23rd] Mr. Young, deputy military attaché of the U.S. Embassy, and a group of eleven people flew from Taipei to Pingtung on the 23rd. They visited Commander Sun Liren and also visited the naval authorities in Zuoying.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Formulates Plan to Prepare for Preventing Unrest</h3>
<p>[Reuters Hong Kong, 23rd] A spokesman for the Hong Kong government's defense department said that the authorities have formulated a plan to deploy troops to support the police in the event of internal unrest in Hong Kong and the Kowloon leased territories. He declined to say whether there is currently an internal threat in the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas or to compare the situation in Hong Kong and Kowloon with Malaysia, but said that although the authorities do not want to use troops to patrol the Kowloon border, the army is ready at any time so that it can be dispatched to assist the police in a short period of time upon notification. He also said that the issue of building a new airport in Kowloon is still under consideration. Currently, the air force in Hong Kong has a squadron of Spitfire fighter planes, a squadron of Sunderland flying boat reconnaissance planes, and a squadron of Auster air observation planes. Some of these planes are suitable for assisting the police and army in reconnaissance in the event of internal unrest.</p>
<h3>Changsha's Commerce Is Depressed; Store Closures Are Rampant</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Changsha, 23rd] Commerce here is depressed, and store closures are rampant. According to a survey by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, nearly 41 rice mills, 23 Anhui salt and cotton yarn shops, and as many as six old gold shops such as Yu Taihua and Li Wenyu have closed in the city in recent months. The business community is seeking relief from this wave of closures.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Province's Total Population is 6.09 Million</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Taipei, 23rd] According to the household census conducted in Taiwan Province on May 1, the total current population of the province is 6.09 million, with 3.06 million men and 3.03 million women, but the stationed troops and their dependents are not included.</p>
<h3>Central Government Decides to Reform Currency System; Stored Xiamen Gold and Silver Coins to Be Used as Foundation; Huang Xuchu Returns to Guangxi After Attending Finance and Food Meeting to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guilin, 23rd] Guangxi Chairman Huang Xuchu flew back to Guilin from Guangzhou yesterday. When reporters visited him and asked about his impressions of the trip, Huang first explained the proceedings of the food and finance meeting and said: Currency reform is imperative, and the central government has decided to use the stored gold and silver coins in Xiamen as the foundation for currency reform, which is expected to be implemented in the short term. He continued: The central government is determined to stop the war with war and suppress the rebellion to the end. The Chinese Communists have no sincerity in seeking peace, which has led to the expansion of the war. They should be held responsible for the war. The entire people must rise up to fight, etc.</p>
<h3>Fujian Issues Silver Dollar Subsidiary Coin Notes; Market Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Fuzhou, 23rd] Due to the recent slight easing of the situation in Fujian and the circulation of silver dollars, silver coins, and copper coins, the market here is gradually stabilizing, but transactions have not yet returned to normal. The Fujian Provincial Bank began issuing silver dollar subsidiary coin notes on the 23rd, with denominations of 1 fen, 5 fen, 1 jiao, 2 jiao, and 5 jiao. The central bank allocated silver dollars and provincial government materials as reserves for full redemption. The difficulties encountered in small-sum transactions in the market in recent weeks have been resolved, and social and economic activities have become more flexible. However, commodity prices in the market are still not uniform. In addition to those priced in silver dollars, many are still calculated in gold and white rice. The rice market is short of rice due to the loss of northern Fujian and the lack of food sources. The black market price of rice is above two qian of gold. The ratio of gold to silver dollars has been set by the authorities at five silver dollars for one qian of gold. The salaries of provincial government employees are also paid in silver dollars.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Peace in Beiping (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the general public education personnel. As early as the beginning of the siege, leaflets from Lin Biao, the commander of the front line, were discovered in the city, outlining eight articles of agreement. Articles four and five concerned public education personnel. Article four stated that after the People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered the city, all school faculty, cultural and educational institutions, health organizations, and other social welfare institution staff would continue to serve, and the PLA would protect them from violation. Article five stated that all officials at the provincial, municipal, and county levels, as well as baojia personnel, who had no reactionary behavior and possessed special skills would be selectively employed. At that time, many public education personnel, who had been oppressed by life for many years, saw some wealthy officials and rich people fleeing south with gold, and while envious and sighing, they suddenly saw this leaflet. Many said that we rely on our mental efforts to eat, and fortunately, we are all Chinese. There is no question of being a traitor. Since people protect and employ us, whoever comes, we will work for them. As the hope for peace intensified, it was rumored that after the Communist Party entered the city, the administrative organs would only replace one head, and the rest would remain unchanged. Even the heads of academic or technical organs would not be replaced, and the treatment would all be paid in kind. Regardless of rank, the quantity would be determined by the number of family members. At that time, the general public education personnel secretly wished for the PLA to come quickly, and some so-called stubborn elements even worried about losing their integrity.</p>
<p>Although time passed slowly, the PLA finally entered the city. The first administrative organ to be taken over was the Hebei Provincial Government, and the military organ was initially the Garrison Command. The method of takeover was to take all the property and furniture, and all the officials, high and low, were swept out the door, even the workers were not left. It is well known that the Hebei Provincial Government, from Chairman Chu Xichun down, was honest and hardworking and employed people with integrity. However, the receivers all looked at people through the lens of "all officials are corrupt." Therefore, they were picky and made things difficult during the takeover. After finally clearing the handover, it was said that on February 24, they received another notice stating that the Hebei Provincial Government should hand over to the North China People's Government, and new rosters should be created, with an attached explanation that after the rosters were created, each supervisor must personally explain and report orally. At that time, officials at all levels had already dispersed, and no one created the rosters. Secretary-General Tao and the heads of the various departments reported the truth, but the answer they received was, "Can't you write yourselves? Why must you rely on others?" Helpless, this group of lonely ministers and remnants had to put on their reading glasses and create the rosters themselves. As for what happened when the North China People's Government took over, there was no way to know. Now, Chairman Chu is living in seclusion at home. When he moved to Beiping, he was acting as the Pan Yang city defense commander and filled out his household registration accordingly. Even after becoming chairman, he did not change it. Therefore, the South Chang Street chief and the public security bureau agents have repeatedly talked to him, asking him to go to training with other scattered military officers. Although he has repeatedly asked Jiao Shiqi to intercede, they still often trouble him. Also, his house at No. 74 South Chang Street was bought from Hu Bohan when he arrived in Beiping. Now the Communist Party also wants to take it over. After asking someone to intercede, he was only allowed to live there temporarily. All the officials of the provincial government have lost their jobs. It is said that Yao, the secretary-general, is planning to earn a living by selling silver ("buy two, sell two," which is the cry of silver traders in Beiping) after the handover is completed. Lower-level officials are not worth asking about.</p>
<p>Following the provincial government was the municipal government. On the day of the takeover, Ye Jianying said: They have no experience in urban work and must learn everything from the old people, but they must learn revolutionary theory from them. Therefore, section chiefs and below can only be temporarily retained. However, in addition to the eight-hour office hours each day, they must also study revolution for two hours, read the People's Daily, Marxism-Leninism, and New Democracy, and listen to the lectures of those old cadres who cannot read half a bushel of large characters. How they will be arranged in the future is still unknown.</p>
<p>As for the academic and technical institutions, they were indeed left untouched, but each unit was assigned three liaison officers from the Military Control Commission, which is equivalent to the liaison officers during the Japanese occupation, that is, the supreme emperors of this institution. Everything, big and small, must be reported to them for instructions, even buying a few sheets of ten-line paper must be approved by them. The liaison officers in the Japanese era were all experts in their fields and were admirable, but these liaison officers were all standard party members who had received strict training from the Communist Party since they were five or six years old. They are all around twenty years old. When it comes to Marxism-Leninism, they only have a smattering of knowledge, but they know nothing about the business of the institutions they are in charge of. The suffering of those experts under the rule of this group of children is imaginable. But that's not all. The most painful thing is learning revolution. Imagine this group of experts, every day like the aforementioned civil servants, being asked to read the superficial and incomprehensible People's Daily and New Democracy. The pain is even more unimaginable. As for the living conditions, the hospital directors, presidents of specialized schools, or chairmen of the school affairs maintenance committees receive 400 to 450 catties of millet, university professors and high school principals receive 300 to 400 catties of millet, middle school teachers or elementary school principals receive 200 to 300 catties of millet, elementary school teachers receive about 200 catties of millet, and the other retained civil servants receive their salaries in similar proportions. Now Beiping is a millet world. Since the public education personnel are all paid in millet, millet is naturally cheap, and other prices are very high. The exchange rate between millet and white flour is said to be three to one. Also, the earnings of an average public education worker are only enough for one person to eat. To support a family, one must come up with another idea.</p>
<p>When it comes to the spirit or emotions, it is even more unspeakable. At the beginning of the victory, governments at all levels also retained personnel from the puppet organizations. Now, those who are retained are even more distressed than they were. Those who were retained in the puppet organizations were just listening to a few more harsh words of "traitor." Now, in addition to often hearing the no longer harsh words "puppet," "reactionary," "counter-revolutionary," and "Chiang bandit," the most distressing thing is the liaison officers' visits. From the age of six or seven to the present, their actions every year are questioned in detail. One person asks, and then another asks. Those who have not experienced it cannot know this kind of bitterness. If it is discovered that you have been involved with so-called reactionary political parties, there will be even more trouble. Now everyone is uneasy and cannot live in peace.</p>
<p>As for the county-level civil servants, most of them had arrived in Beiping when the counties were abandoned. The central task of these people was to suppress the rebellion. How could they not directly or indirectly offend some Communists? Now that Beiping has become a Communist world, it is truly a case of "those with grievances will be avenged, and those with grudges will be repaid." Communists from various counties have come to Beiping to find them and send them back to their counties to be purged. The threat they face is even greater than those originally in Beiping. Now many are terrified all day long and do not know what to do. As for the baojia personnel, although they have repeatedly expressed their loyalty, after the district chief is replaced, they begin to hold district people's congresses for purging. Even if the purge is flawless, they are forced to read a pre-printed letter of repentance in public. The main points are that they should not have helped the reactionary government to do things, should not have helped the reactionary government to conscript soldiers and laborers, and should not have been corrupt. Those who are honest and self-disciplined also have to read it while swallowing their grievances. As for how they will be dealt with after repenting and being dismissed, it is still unknown. Now the baojia system in Beiping has been abolished and replaced by the street neighborhood system. Each street has a street chief, who is filled by a Communist Party cadre. There are street chiefs in the northern and southern parts of Xiaonanhai. Below the street is the neighborhood, and the neighborhood chief is appointed by the street chief, who considers them to be loyal and reliable. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stands Firm; Whether It Can Be Defended for Long Depends on the Government's Determination</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 23rd] The defense of Shanghai is currently underway fiercely. This is a matter of international concern. Whether Shanghai, a large city with 6 million citizens, can be defended for long depends entirely on the central government. It is reported that the Communist army originally planned to capture Shanghai on the 17th of this month. However, due to the resistance of our heroic defenders, they have not succeeded. The Chinese Communists then broadcast that in order to facilitate the withdrawal of the National army, they would occupy Shanghai on the 19th. Who knew that the Communist army's plan failed, and Shanghai still stood firm. It has recently been heard that the Chinese Communists are broadcasting again, saying that in consideration of the lives and property of the 6 million citizens of Shanghai, they have decided to postpone the offensive and temporarily delay the occupation of Shanghai, etc. This shows that the National army is capable of fighting and defending well and can truly ensure the safety of Shanghai. The consistent propaganda tactics used by the Chinese Communists have been shattered by the strong resistance of our heroic National army. According to Mr. Wang Xiaolai, who has just arrived in Guangzhou from Shanghai, the National army can definitely defend Shanghai, without a doubt. The 6 million citizens of Shanghai can unite with the same hatred and work closely with the National army. This is why the defense of Shanghai can be successful. The people of Shanghai fear that once the Communist army controls Shanghai, their lives and property will not be guaranteed, and their personal freedom will also be deprived. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai all oppose the Communist Party. However, as the war becomes more and more intense, the consumption is increasing day by day, and it is difficult to continue. Whether the Shanghai National army can defend for a long time depends on the government's determination.</p>
<h3>Editorial: From Silver Dollars to Prices</h3>
<p>——Establish a Public Silver Dollar Market As Soon As Possible</p>
<p>The exchange rate for silver dollars was initially set by the Central Bank at 9.6 million (in the local currency). It was then adjusted to 13.2 million on the 21st of this month, and again to 36 million starting yesterday. This kind of dynamic adjustment is a commendable response to natural economic trends. Given the substantial amount of Gold Yuan being issued, especially to cover military and government expenses, the market is effectively flooded with these new notes, which inevitably drives up prices. Therefore, the current surge in prices is not caused by the prices themselves, but rather a passive consequence of the monetary policy. This is something that should be clearly understood.</p>
<p>In essence, silver dollars are a financial commodity, and their fluctuations are naturally linked to the overall price level. Especially in the current environment, silver dollars are not only a common commodity but also function as currency due to their intrinsic value, smaller denominations, and flexible use. People hold silver dollars to preserve value and purchase daily necessities. In fact, they are happy to collect them. Consequently, silver dollar transactions are particularly active whenever government employees or other salaried workers receive their pay. This trend underscores the correctness of the aforementioned theory. However, on the other hand, the price of silver dollars is not controlled by the Central Bank, which holds a large quantity of silver, but rather determined by speculators, which is somewhat perplexing.</p>
<p>Recently, the Central Bank has also recognized that the price of silver dollars is being manipulated by speculators, and that silver dollar transactions are scattered throughout the streets, which negatively impacts normal economic development. Therefore, it decided some time ago to establish a public silver dollar market. However, this plan has not yet been implemented, making one question the effectiveness of our Central Bank. In the modern world, central banks in various countries generally stabilize markets through open market operations. Although our current situation is quite dire, it is still necessary for the Central Bank to implement an open market policy.</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing a silver dollar market is to allow the Central Bank to control the market through this channel in the future. Furthermore, the listing of silver dollars should enable dynamic measures to be taken daily, moving prices toward a more reasonable level. As for the type of silver dollars, we believe that different prices may be initially set when they are first listed. However, with the exception of "boat dollars" (ship-image coins), all other silver dollars should be gradually withdrawn and sent to the Central Mint to be recast into new coins. This would eliminate the various kinds of foreign silver coins from the market. All of the "big head," "eagle," "dragon," "Hong Kong," and miscellaneous silver dollars would become nothing more than historical names. Matters of state should ideally be handled "with virtue and persuasion," especially in economic affairs. Moreover, today's holders of silver dollars are largely government employees and salaried workers who have saved their money. Ignoring this fact and rigidly fixing the price of silver dollars would be tantamount to depriving them of their hard-earned income. How could the authorities possibly do this?</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is necessary for the Central Bank to establish a public silver dollar market, whether from a legal, humanistic, or economic standpoint. Only when the Central Bank establishes a public silver dollar market will the price of silver dollars be brought back to normalcy, and the chaos in social prices will be alleviated.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers Reunited at the Palais Rose Marble in Paris Thousands of People Scramble to Witness the Grand Meeting</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Paris, 23rd: The Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union convened at the Palais Rose Marble in Paris at 2:55 PM (Universal Time) on the 23rd to initiate the historic Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference. Thousands of people gathered outside the gates of the Palais Rose Marble. Approximately fifty journalists and photographers stood outside the gates, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the four foreign ministers. The four foreign ministers arrived directly at the palace gates in police-escorted vehicles, followed by advisors and experts. Acheson was the first to arrive at the venue. After stepping out of his car, he entered the palace with Jessup. The Bevans arrived four minutes later in a British Embassy car, followed by Vyshinsky's car, which bore the Soviet flag. French Foreign Minister Schuman had been waiting in the palace before the other three foreign ministers arrived. Journalists busily took photographs before leaving the venue, marking the commencement of the first session of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] The Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference is being held in the luxurious Palais Rose Marble in western Paris. The British, American, and French Foreign Ministers held a 90-minute meeting at the French Foreign Ministry yesterday. Afterwards, State Department Press Officer McDermott stated that the three foreign ministers had discussed the German issue for quite some time and should know how to handle it. After attending the meeting, Acheson walked back to the American Embassy instead of taking a car. He then had lunch with Ambassador-at-Large Jessup and Republican foreign policy advisor Dulles. Among the four foreign ministers attending this conference, only Bevin has participated in previous Foreign Ministers Conferences. Acheson and Schuman are attending for the first time, and Vyshinsky is also attending as the chief delegate for the first time. The general issues facing the foreign ministers at the opening of this conference can be summarized as follows: (1) Europe is already divided. Can the Soviet Union and the Western countries agree on a solution to the German issue? (2) If the four powers agree to the division of Germany, trade between East and West will be permanently broken, which will encourage mutual suspicion. (3) If they agree on the unification of Germany, the political struggle for the future status of Germany will intensify. (4) The four powers may also agree to establish a Germany that is politically divided but economically unified, but the conditions are still subject to negotiation. The Soviet Union favors a centralized German government controlled by the Communist Party, with a government selected by popular vote based on a single list of candidates. The Western countries advocate for the establishment of a Federal Republic of Germany, with a federal government selected from various political parties through free and secret general elections. The main problem at this Foreign Ministers Conference is how to eliminate the ideological differences between these Eastern and Western powers.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] After Acheson arrived here yesterday, the three foreign ministers immediately convened to review the 32-page report prepared by the Deputy Foreign Ministers, which was completed and approved today. It is reported that the Western foreign ministers approved the Deputy Foreign Ministers' report with the following two points: (1) Oppose any suggestion from the Soviet side to end the military occupation of Germany early. (2) Agree in principle that Germany should be unified, but insist that it should not be unified under conditions that would make Germany a Soviet vassal. The last preliminary meeting of the Western foreign ministers began at 10:30 AM and ended at 11:50 AM. Those who accompanied Acheson to the meeting included Dulles, Jessup, and State Department Counselor Bohlen. The three foreign ministers appeared quite pleased at the time. Bevin criticized Dulles' remarks, saying, "There will also be a gathering this afternoon, as the French and British football teams will face off." Bevin then went to the venue to watch the game, while Acheson and Dulles took their wives to visit Versailles. Acheson then convened his advisors at the American Embassy in the afternoon to discuss matters.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] The Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and France held their final meeting this morning at the French Foreign Ministry. They approved the preliminary talk reports submitted by the representatives of the three countries and experts on German issues, and agreed on a method of announcing the progress of the Four Power Conference. They prepared to suggest to the Soviet Foreign Minister to use the methods used in the past, namely that after each meeting, the spokespersons of each delegation would hold a press conference to announce the proceedings of that meeting.</p>
<h3>Bonn Constitution Officially Announced and Implemented West Germany Republic Born Elections for Government and Parliament to Be Held Within Three Months</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 23rd: Bonn News: The German Constitutional Assembly announced the implementation of the new constitution on the 23rd, officially marking the birth of the Federal Republic of West Germany. The West German Federation will include the states within the American, British, and French occupation zones, but the door remains open for the states in the Soviet occupation zone to join. However, it is expected that as long as the Soviet occupation continues, East Germany will remain outside. The seventy politicians who drafted the constitution will announce the dissolution of the assembly. Elections for the new republic's government and parliament will be held within the next three months. Berlin is not included in the new federation, but it may send representatives to attend parliamentary sessions as observers. Eighty-eight non-Communists signed the new constitution in a simple and solemn ceremony.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 22nd] The Bonn Constitutional Assembly will hold its final meeting on Monday to officially announce the constitution, stipulating the establishment of the Federal Republic of West Germany. The chairmen of the local councils and the leaders of the three Western allies will attend. German political figures attach great importance to this move. They emphasize that the West German constitution has been unanimously approved by the states of West Germany except Bavaria, and is supported by all West German political parties except the Christian Social Union in Bavaria and the Communist Party. This demonstrates the unity of West Germany.</p>
<h3>Relations Between the United States and the Soviet Union May Improve Clay Gives Radio Address in the United States</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 22nd] General Clay, former commander of the American forces in Germany, declared in a radio address here today that relations between the United States and the Soviet Union may improve, but believes that Soviet leaders are not currently prepared to abandon their desire to "dominate the world." Clay continued, "As for the Cold War, we can reach an agreement and improve the situation. But we should not forget that the real goal of communism is to dominate the world, and this goal will never be abandoned."</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Publishes Commentary Indicating Soviet Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 23rd] Regarding the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Paris on May 23rd, "Time and Tide" commented: Regardless of the Soviet leaders' true motive for requesting the convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference, it would be a grave error if we were to believe that they have decided to make significant changes in their foreign policy. We must assume that their fundamental policies remain unchanged, and that they will continue to strive to achieve the following objectives: to prevent West Germany from forming a political and economic life based on Western principles, and to prevent the Western countries from achieving solid security through the North Atlantic Treaty. "Time and Tide" concluded: The Western countries must not deviate from the path they have taken, and should reach an agreement with the Soviet Union without sacrificing important principles. "The Economist" also emphasized the difficulties and dangers in this Foreign Ministers Conference, and stated that the Western countries should first make a clear statement on their policy towards Germany. The newspaper pointed out that the only wise approach is to announce at the opening of the Foreign Ministers Conference that the Western countries desire a unified Germany, the withdrawal of occupying forces, and the submission of appropriate conditions. The newspaper continued that in addition to guaranteeing the protection of Germany's political freedom, the Western countries should also reaffirm the suggestion previously made by Byrnes to conclude a fifty-year treaty between the four powers, in order to maintain the demilitarization of Germany and prevent the resurgence of German military power. If the Soviet Union is truly as peace-loving as they claim, then this suggestion should be able to become the first step in a policy of reconciliation between the Western countries and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Speech Attacks Bonn Constitution Believes It Is the Restoration of Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] General de Gaulle, speaking at the adjournment of the French People's Rally today, emphasized that France should restore sufficient strength to balance the power of Germany. De Gaulle attacked the West German constitution in Bonn, believing this is the restoration of Germany, and said that the Atlantic Treaty should not be approved before supplementary measures are taken. De Gaulle hopes that France and Germany can reach an understanding, but said that this understanding requires certain conditions. And the main condition is that France should become strong again with the help of French North Africa, in order to balance the power of the new Germany and make economic understanding between the two countries possible. De Gaulle emphasized that France should restore its economic and financial strength within its resource capabilities. At the adjournment of the conference, it was announced that the party's foreign policy, defense policy, and policy toward French alliances are different from those of the French government, and attacked the government for its repeated failures in financial, economic, and social aspects.</p>
<h3>Burmese Army Recovers Insein</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 22nd] The city of Insein, which had been occupied by the Karen forces for sixteen weeks, was recovered by government forces today. The city is ten miles north of Rangoon. When the Burmese government forces entered, the Karen forces had completely withdrawn north, and the Karen President Ba Yi Ji, who was originally in the city, had also escaped. When the Karen forces withdrew, the residents of the city immediately raised white flags. The city originally had 20,000 residents, and 10,000 of them had evacuated to Rangoon during the temporary truce. The Insein Central Prison, known as the third largest prison in the world, is intact and undamaged, with about 500 prisoners still inside. The government's announcement also announced that government forces were simultaneously advancing towards Taikkyi, another Karen stronghold seventy miles north of Rangoon.</p>
<h3>U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Creates a Laughingstock Senators Demand His Immediate Resignation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] Republican Senator Hickenlooper today demanded that Mr. Lilienthal resign from his position as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, believing that this committee is the cause of many jokes. Two recent examples are the missing uranium-235 and the awarding of bonuses to some people who should not have access to the committee's secrets. Hickenlooper previously served as chairman of the Congressional Atomic Energy Committee.</p>
<h3>New Cabinet of Colombia Personnel Determined Former Police Chief Appointed Prime Minister</h3>

<h3>Number of Japanese POWs in the Soviet Union Should Be Over 300,000 MacArthur's Advisor Doubts Soviet Reported Figures</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] Civil Adviser Sebald, Allied Supreme Commander MacArthur's political advisor, stated that according to careful estimates, the number of Japanese prisoners of war still in Soviet hands "should" be over 300,000. Sebald made this statement in response to an official statement reported by Moscow's TASS News Agency from the Soviet War Prisoners Repatriation Administration, which claimed that all Japanese war prisoners remaining in the Soviet Union would be repatriated to their home country within the months of May and November this year. TASS News Agency released a total of only 97,000 of these prisoners of war. Sebald pointed out that the number of 95,000 is the first estimate released by the Soviet government since World War II. Before departing from Tokyo on May 3rd to report to duty here, he personally protested to the Soviet representative on behalf of MacArthur, arguing that the Soviet Union did not provide sufficient information regarding the number of Japanese prisoners of war. In April of this year, Sebald wrote to the Soviet representative, requesting the publication of reports on the deaths, disappearances, and serious illnesses of Japanese war prisoners. The Soviet Union has never provided such reports to the Allied Headquarters, but Sebald pointed out that such reports are extremely important to the Japanese people, especially to the families of the individuals involved. There were no reports on the prisoners of war acquired by the Soviet Union, not only in the East, but also in the West. The United States has twice requested the Soviet Union to report on the situation of German prisoners of war this year. The number of German prisoners of war is estimated to be around 500,000, and their fate remains shrouded in secrecy. Since November of last year, the Soviet Union has not repatriated Japanese prisoners of war. The suspension of the repatriation work at that time was said to be due to climate and ice conditions. Although the Allied Headquarters has repeatedly expressed its willingness to assist in overcoming these difficulties, it has still been ineffective. The list of the last repatriation in November of last year also shows that the Soviet Union had not fulfilled the agreement between the Allied Headquarters and the Soviet Union to repatriate 50,000 prisoners of war per month for 18 consecutive months.</p>

<h3>Forrestal's Death Shocks the World British and American Leaders Express Condolences All U.S. Military Facilities Fly Flags at Half-Mast</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] President Truman issued a written statement today regarding the death of former Secretary of Defense Forrestal, expressing his unspeakable shock and grief upon learning of the death of his friend Forrestal. The death of this capable and loyal public servant is no less than the death of a soldier on the front lines. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, in Paris, said that all those who were close to Forrestal, including himself, were worried about Forrestal's illness. We deeply know the weight of the responsibilities he bore during the difficult years of war and after the war. I originally hoped that rest could restore his health, but unfortunately it did not go as expected, which makes the whole country feel regret. British Defense Minister Alexander, in London, also said that Forrestal was a great servant of the United States and its fighting forces, as well as the entire democratic system.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The new Secretary of Defense Johnson, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Eisenhower, and former President Hoover all sent condolences.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] President Truman and all officials in Washington were shocked on the 22nd by the news of former Secretary of Defense Forrestal's suicide. All military facilities and naval vessels in the United States today flew flags at half-mast.</p>
<h3>Forrestal Attempted Suicide Three Times Before Jumping From Building American Radio Commentator Reveals</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Radio commentator Pearson was one of the first to publicly disclose that former Secretary of Defense Forrestal was seriously ill. In his regular broadcast on the evening of the 21st, he said that only two weeks ago, the fourth suicide attempt was prevented by employees of the Bethesda Naval Hospital. He did not specify how Forrestal attempted suicide, only saying that Forrestal had attempted suicide by hanging, cutting his veins, and taking sleeping pills in Florida. Forrestal was transferred to Bethesda because of these three suicide attempts.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy to Conduct Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] After former Secretary of Defense Forrestal committed suicide by jumping from a building at the Navy Hospital today, a volume of ancient Greek poetry was found in his bedroom. On one of the opened pages, the poem said: "When the days of reason are without light and joy, it is better to die and sleep forever." Forrestal jumped from a sixteenth-floor window, falling to his death on a third-floor balcony, with a bathrobe belt tied around his neck. The Navy Department immediately organized an investigative committee to thoroughly investigate the reasons and why no one was guarding the room at the time. Forrestal had been suffering from overwork and had been in the hospital for seven weeks, but he ended up in this situation.</p>
<h3>Former British Representative to Allied Control Council Condemns U.S. Assistance to Japan Will Allow Japan to Threaten the World Again</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 22nd] "Japan—Enemy or Ally?", a book written by former British Commonwealth representative to the Allied Control Council for Japan in Tokyo, Bower, has recently been published. The book expresses that the United States may allow Japan to become a threat again. Bower said that fear of the Soviet Union has caused the United States to view Japan as a "highly hopeful ally" rather than a "hated enemy." During the three and a half years of occupation, there have been no fundamental changes in Japan's social institutions or the political situation of its neighbors. Bower also said, "It may be true that if the United States maintains its current strategic interests in the Far East for a long time, the United States will easily suppress any signs of Japan's future re-aggression, or the United States' maintenance of its military and political control in this area will continue to consume a large amount of American resources. And the commercial compensation is insignificant, so we cannot determine whether the United States will be prepared to maintain these obligations indefinitely. The economic assistance that Japan currently receives from the United States is more likely to cause international disputes. Isn't restoring Japan as the workshop of East Asia helping Japan to re-establish its economic imperialism? During the war, we shed a lot of sweat and blood and spent a lot of materials to destroy Japan's economic imperialism."</p>

<h3>Serious Situation of Railway Workers' Strike in Berlin: US, British, and French Commanders Meet to Discuss Countermeasures Against Soviet Conflicts with Workers</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] On the third day of the Berlin railway workers' strike, the situation remains serious. US military commander Howley has convened a meeting of British and French military commanders this morning to discuss countermeasures. According to Howley, "This embarrassing situation requires our attention. This is no longer a dispute between the Soviet-managed railway bureau and the workers. The bureau has used armed personnel and police to suppress the strike and threatened workers with permanent dismissal." Currently, railway services in all Berlin occupation zones have mostly returned to normal, with only the elevated railway yet to resume operation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 22nd] Communist anti-strikers and armed police departing from the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin clashed with German striking workers on the elevated railway today, fighting over the main lines of the elevated railway in Berlin, resulting in bloodshed. German police under Soviet control opened fire during the melee, killing one person and injuring eighteen. This is the second day of riots caused by the strike. Police estimate that the total number of injured has reached one thousand. Today, in addition to minor skirmishes, at least nine bloody battles occurred, with both sides accusing each other of attempting to start a civil war on the eve of the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' meeting in Paris tomorrow. At the Charlottenburg station in the British sector of Berlin, control changed hands four times during the day. British armed police later occupied the station, with orders to shoot to kill if the Communists fired again. A leader of the independent UGO railway union, to which the strikers belong, threatened to launch a general strike unless an agreement is reached. However, late on the 22nd, the strike leaders decided against this, only reiterating the demand that all German police controlled by the Soviet Union leave the three western districts of Berlin. According to international agreements, the elevated railway of Berlin, including those in the western districts, is under Soviet control. The German railway workers launched the strike at midnight on the 20th, demanding payment in marks issued by the Western Allies, rather than the less valuable marks issued by the Soviet Union. Fighting broke out immediately after the strike was launched, and has gradually intensified over the past forty-eight hours.</p>
<h3>French President Auriol Encourages National Effort</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] French President Auriol stated today that France is progressing on the road to recovery. However, he said that the Marshall Plan will end in 1952, so the French people must not relax. The President said, "We are very close to our goal, but we must not allow the passions of political parties or unreasonable fantasies to destroy everything. We must set aside political ideas, forget political disputes and differences, and work together under the premise of the Republic and the premise of political, economic, and social stability."</p>
<h3>South Irish Government Opposes Irish Bill</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] The Irish Foreign Ministry today opposed the British government's recent passage of the Irish Bill, protesting that Britain will guarantee the continued division of Ireland. The South Irish Government Information Bureau issued a lengthy statement, stating that the unilateral and ineffective arrangements made by the British government in the Irish Bill are not in line with the policy of mutual friendship and cooperation between Britain and Ireland. The British government did not notify the Irish Foreign Ministry or consult with Ireland before discussing the Irish Bill in the House of Commons.</p>
<h3>American Experts on Aid to Backward Countries Plan Propose Steps Must Be Taken: Creating a Favorable Environment is Essential for Economic Development</h3>
<p>Regarding the global technical and financial assistance cooperation program proposed in President Truman's inaugural address, one of the four points in the plan, preparatory work has revealed how underdeveloped countries must establish their higher living standards and how other countries can assist them. One of the latest developments is that Mr. Morse, Chairman of the Governing Body of the International Labor Organization, announced here that the International Labor Organization has established technical training centers in four major locations around the world. Meanwhile, spokespersons representing various institutions such as the World Bank, the United Nations Economic and Employment Commission, and the US State Department and Department of Agriculture, stated that the following steps must be taken. Countries that require economic development must obtain most of the necessary funds from their own people, and the rest should be used to attract private investment from other places. To succeed, each country must create a favorable "environment," ensuring that investors have reasonable guarantees to prevent financial losses and obtain reasonable profits. In most underdeveloped countries, agricultural development must be prioritized, and this requires modern transportation, electricity, and irrigation. Industrial development must be second. The overall plan is as follows: More food, improved sanitation, and disease prevention programs will produce healthier people, which in turn can produce stronger workers. Technical training must cultivate sufficient technical and management personnel capable of using modern methods. Stable government and stable currency, and guarantees to investors, will attract more investment for development projects. Before any development plan begins, thorough scientific research must be conducted to first determine whether the country has sufficient natural resources and can guarantee sufficient production, and that the products produced can be sold in the world's dollar area to repay the necessary imports of modern equipment, while still keeping the country in a good balance of payments position. After underdeveloped countries take these steps and meet these conditions, they will be able to move steadily towards a better standard of living, increasingly comparable to more fortunate countries. Experts agree on this point. Mr. Ma Fuli of the International Chamber of Commerce stated at Success Lake on Thursday, telling the United Nations Economic and Employment Commission that the economic development of underdeveloped regions depends on creating a "more favorable climate for investment." American representative Lu Ping told the committee that the reason why American capital cannot reach urgently needed areas is not the desire for huge profits, but fear. Fear arises from political and monetary instability, the inability to convert profits into other currencies, complicated taxes, and the risk of investment. The United States is now preparing to negotiate treaties with other countries to eliminate the reasons for fear. In a memorandum to the committee, the World Bank stated: "The Bank's lending is limited to sound and productive projects, and this decision will not waver." But it pointed out: "The development of underdeveloped countries depends on the continuous inflow of capital, and this capital should be invested in a series of orderly plans." The Bank's continued investment at a fixed investment rate can help countries avoid sudden changes in business conditions. According to the Bank's experience, "the best way to achieve higher real income is to invest in agriculture." This goal often needs to be supplemented by investment in light or heavy industry to achieve. However, for extreme industrialization that emphasizes industry while ignoring heavy industry, underdeveloped countries may only have the appearance of development without the substance." US Secretary of Agriculture Brannan recently stated in a speech: "Two-thirds of the world's population depends on agriculture for a living, and the percentage is higher in underdeveloped countries. Despite these efforts to produce food, the vast majority of the world's people are still unable to eat enough." Brannan reported to President Truman's Economic Development Committee on the prospects for the implementation of the World Technical Assistance Program. It is said: "This program is not something that can be done overnight. Even if we jointly use the resources of various countries through the Food and Agriculture Organization and other United Nations agencies, this will not be achieved overnight. One of the reasons is the lack of sufficient trained personnel to do this work. Furthermore, we have found that the real work must be completed by the local people themselves. We must be able to assist in training a large number of local personnel to spread scientific knowledge and technology in their own countries. Then our efforts will have a significant effect on world production. In a world that is two-thirds agricultural, this program must focus on improving the production of food and fibers. However, at the same time, we should keep in mind that as we increase the application of science to agriculture, many industrial developments must also go hand in hand. If there are no roads to transport products to the market, increasing food production is of little value. Therefore, railways and trucks, refrigerators and warehouses, canning factories and distribution agencies are necessary. Fertilizers, pesticides, and tools are also indispensable. In short, the various benefits that our country's agriculture has benefited from industry must also be popularized in these countries, because our country's agriculture, without the assistance of industry, would not be more effective than the agriculture of the countries we intend to assist." Morse said that the International Labor Organization has just established the International Labor Organization's Asian Technical Training Center in New Delhi, India, with Anderson of San Francisco as the director. Anderson is an expert known for developing the wartime training system for Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. Morse said that the International Labor Organization's European Technical Training Center has also been established in Rome, led by British Deputy Labor Secretary Ross. The training center will temporarily focus on the needs of Italy, but will later turn its attention to the technical assistance needs of the entire Europe. The Latin American Technical Training Center is in the planning stage, and the Near East Technical Training Center is in the investigation stage. These regional training centers will provide guidance and services to countries that need economic and technical assistance for development. (US News Service)</p>
<h3>Yiyuan's Accumulated Water Makes It Unusable: Dongqing Changes to Today's Decisive Battle; Thousands of Fans Made Futile Trips Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Dongqing final battle of the Three Strong Football Invitation Tournament was again postponed by one day due to continuous rain. The Yiyuan field was covered in accumulated water and was too damp. To protect the field, it had to be postponed for one day and rescheduled to be held at Yiyuan at 3:30 PM today. Thousands of fans waited anxiously and made futile trips yesterday. The organizers deeply apologize. All tickets today are 10,000 yuan. To improve the order at the entrance of Yiyuan, tickets will be sold in advance at the Municipal Gymnasium from 12:00 noon. Tickets will not be sold at the entrance of Yiyuan. In addition to military police maintaining order, the Siwei Boy Scouts will be at the venue to assist. Qingbai team announces that all team members will gather at the Shuanglong Bathhouse at 2:30 PM to depart, and those who are late will not be waited for. Today's referee is Fang Rongfu, and the linesmen are Chen Fubao and Xu Guoliang. The lineups of the two teams are listed below:</p>
<p>Donghua</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Wu Qixiang, Xie Xichuan, Zhang Lingen</p>
<p>Chen Lianglian, Li Kongjin, Hannibo, Yu Zhixing</p>
<p>Li Yao, Gao Xiuqing, Han Longhai, Chen Mingzhe, Qian Yuanqing, Guan Yongchang</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Huang Shijie</p>
<p>Yan Shixin, Jiang Qing, Qiang Yuanzhi</p>
<p>Zhang Renyi, Qian Changrong, Meng Yiliang, Fu Naitang</p>
<p>Jin Lusheng, Luo Shoufu, Liu Longxin, Liu Tiyin, Gu Yi, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Historically, the Dongqing battle has always been a sensation in Shanghai, and this time is no exception. The two teams encountered each other last Thursday. Because they were fighting in heavy rain, it was temporarily changed to a friendly match. Donghua only had ten players to play, and the result was a 1-1 draw, which shows that Donghua's strength has not diminished. The team's goalkeeper is Zhang Banglun, our World Games representative, who is steady and extraordinary, and has a good grasp of the upper, middle, and lower routes. On the defensive side, there are three brave generals: Wu Qixiang, Zhang Lingen, and Hannibo, who are able to cope with the group of new players from Qingbai. Chen Lianglian received high praise for his role in the match against the railway team. The four forwards, Han Longhai, Chen Mingzhe, Gao Xiuqing, and Li Yao, are skilled, especially Longhai's skills, which are most admired. Today, when playing against Qingbai, they will surely exert their power.</p>
<p>Qingbai, the newly crowned champion of this year's league, is the pride of the current football scene. In addition to the original team members, Yan Shixin, a former national team player who has been retired for a long time, is returning to the field, which shows the team's importance to this match. The team's offensive lineup is complete. Jin Lusheng and Luo Shoufu are quite fierce, and Liu Longxin is as still as a tiger cub and as agile as a rabbit. He has received good reviews in the previous two performances. Fei Chunhua, after returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong, has made rapid progress in his skills. When he flies with Jin Lusheng on both wings, he will definitely pose a threat to Donghua. Meng Yiliang will be in charge of the center defense line and will do his best to organize Han Longhai's rapid breakthrough. Whether Meng can stop Longhai will be the key to the victory or defeat of both sides today. In short, it is inevitable that there will be a fierce battle between the two heroes. Which of the three teams will win the championship depends on today's battle.</p>
<h3>First Division Table Tennis League: Hualian Plays Postal Today</h3>
<p>In the fourth table tennis league, there were originally two first-division matches today (24th): Postal B vs. Silk White, and Hualian vs. Postal. We have received a notice from the Silk White team that the silk industry ball room has other uses and cannot compete. Therefore, the Postal B vs. Silk White match will be rescheduled. All matches scheduled in the silk industry ball room in this week's schedule will be rescheduled.</p>
<p>Hualian has won three out of three matches. This is their fourth time playing. If they can pass this test against Postal, they will continue to face the three strong teams of Silk White, All Green, and United Star, to compete for the championship. Postal has performed four times and although they have three losses and one win, their strength is not inferior to Hualian. They will definitely go all out to win. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Hualian - Postal (First Division) 6:00 PM, Jingfen</p>
<p>(Hualian) Zhang Zhihong, Deng Xiurong, Li Zhen, Lu Wenliang, Zhong Zhihui, Pan Rixi, Yang Zhixiong.</p>
<p>(Postal) Liu Zaoshi, Wang Xianzhang, Wang Chuanyao, Jiang Chunshan, Zhuang Kunrong, Yang Peitian, Dong Wenshao.</p>
<p>The other day, Lingyun in the Second Division B put in a lot of effort. Lingyun was greatly threatened by Yongwu due to the loss of veteran players Wang Weirong and Hu Yangshu. Fortunately, Yang Shixiang defeated Yongwu's Deng Bingyi with two wins and one loss, leveling the score to 2-2. In the final match, Yongwu's veteran Zhong Huiquan fought fiercely against the opponent's young player Gu Yunfang. The two fought fiercely for three games. Zhong was physically exhausted and had to retire. Gu Yunfang won with two wins and one loss. As a result, Lingyun defeated Yongwu with three wins and two losses. In addition, due to Shanbao's withdrawal, the previous one point loss was cancelled out. Currently, with a record of seven wins and seven losses, they are at the top. The results of both sides are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Lingyun) Score (Yongwu)</p>
<p>Wang Genlin 2-0 Lin Yonglun</p>
<p>Wang Weirong 0-2 Chen Zhenan</p>
<p>Hu Yangshu 0-2 Guo Maozhi</p>
<p>Yang Shixiang 2-1 Deng Bingyi</p>
<p>Gu Yunfang 2-1 Zhong Huiquan</p>
<h3>University Joint Football Team Established: Will Arrange Matches with Strong Teams Soon</h3>
<p>The organization of the University Joint Football Team started in 1943 and was invited by the Australian and New Zealand Football Association to participate in matches. Now, football players from various universities in the city, such as Liu Longxin and Jiang Qing, believe that it is necessary to restore this organization. They have obtained the consent of major football players and officially and voluntarily organized the "University Joint" football team. Its purpose is to discuss football skills with friendly teams, connect feelings, and maintain a noble sportsmanship, with good intentions. All athletes belong to the football teams of universities such as Hujiang, Jiaotong, Fudan, St. John's, Wusong Business Group, Political Science, Zhijiang, Datong, and Tongji. The lineup is complete and the strength is strong. It is currently scheduled for 3:00 PM on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons this week, to practice at the Donghua Sports Association field. Friendly matches will be held with various strong teams soon. The team lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Shijie Cheng</p>
<p>Jiang Qing Liang Tao Zheng Deyao</p>
<p>Zhang Renyi Qian Changrong Chen Zhigang Fu Naitang</p>
<p>Zhu Jianqiu Xu Zuguo Gu Qi Wu Jingren Liu Longxin Liu Tishi</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Bevin's Emerging Prominence</h3>
<p>The most important conference in postwar Europe—the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference—opened in Paris on the 23rd. Among the four foreign ministers attending the conference, the most prominent is British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin (1881–). He is now a very important figure in the British House of Commons and throughout British society. However, just nine years ago, when he was fifty-seven years old, he had not yet directly participated in political circles, let alone becoming a minister or member of parliament.</p>
<p>He originally devoted himself to the trade union movement. Prime Minister Churchill personally promoted him to the cabinet and arranged a position for him in parliament. When he first took office as Minister of Labour, Britain was busy mobilizing for war. Because he had a thorough understanding of his work, his subordinates' loyalty to him was unparalleled. He was a close collaborator with Prime Minister Churchill. In 1945, he began to serve as Foreign Secretary. By then, he had a thorough understanding and skillful technique of diplomacy, could handle things smoothly in parliament, and had very close contact with the general public. So it can be said that he didn't need to "fear" anyone.</p>
<p>Speaking of Bevin's background, it is very pitiful. He came from a poor family, and his parents died when he was not yet eight years old. When he was eleven years old, he ran to Bristol alone and worked as a servant in a hotel. Later, he worked as a railway escort, a grocery store assistant, and a driver. Because he was a driver, he began to contact the workers at the Bristol Docks. At this time, he joined the drivers' group of the Docks Union. From this time on, he truly participated in the trade union movement.</p>
<p>In 1920, he delivered his famous eleven-hour speech at the Transport Workers Inquiry Office, and as a result, he won a fixed minimum wage standard for dockworkers. In this way, he was given the honorary title of "Dockworkers' Advocate." In September 1936, he was elected chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions. He continued to hold this position in the following year. In May 1940, he became Minister of Labour, and in October of the same year, he joined the wartime cabinet.</p>
<p>From 1945, Bevin became Foreign Secretary. There are a few great men in the world who come from humble backgrounds, who are inferior to the middle class in terms of money and education, but who finally achieve everlasting success through their own efforts. Bevin is one of them.</p>
<h3>Looking Westward at Xikang</h3>
<p>— Wang Jiaqi</p>
<p>[Kangding Dispatch] Going westward from Kangding, after climbing over a mountain four thousand meters above sea level, one discovers a different world. The boundless grasslands also contain sparse hills. Everywhere you look, you see a vast green wilderness, which immediately freshens and broadens your horizons. When the party's warm sun shines on the earth, this tranquil frontier, like Iceland in the Arctic Circle, is filled with a very strong religious atmosphere. The towering buildings constructed from granite on the plains, from a distance, resemble Western architecture. The groups of leisurely cattle and sheep, and the tall, sturdy, and simple shepherds, evoke the style of ancient Greece.</p>
<p>Maintaining Chinese Courtesy</p>
<p>Most of the residents of Xikang Province are Tibetans. Although they do not pay attention to material civilization, their exquisite craftsmanship in residential buildings, embroidery, Buddhist statues, murals, reliefs, clothing, and utensil decorations is not inferior to that of our inland areas. In social aspects, they retain the courteous manners of ancient China and often perform chivalrous deeds. They value politeness more than modern Han Chinese. This can be seen from the presentation of "Hada," which means "joyful silk," similar to the ancient practice of "presenting silk." The etiquette includes bowing, kowtowing, sticking out the tongue, and a head-touching ritual, similar to kissing in Western culture, implying intimacy. Social interaction between men and women has a Western flavor; their interactions are completely open and free, without any feudal restrictions. Formal unions between men and women also involve very solemn and interesting rituals. Wedding ceremonies vary from place to place, but the expression of emotions is very humorous.</p>
<p>Lamaism prevails within the region because the residents are Tibetan. Their lives are as beautiful and peaceful as the natural environment. They all devoutly believe in religion and worship lamas. If a family has one son, he must be sent to a lama temple; if they have three sons, they must send two. Can you say this is a foolish thing? They believe in their hearts that this is a sacred and honorable act. Their faith in lamas is as incomprehensible as Westerners' faith in Christianity.</p>
<p>Special Ethnic Groups Coexisting</p>
<p>Within Daofu and Ganzi, gold deposits are extremely abundant. Everywhere, you can see locals digging gold mines. Unfortunately, they lack new exploration tools and methods, burying these countless valuable mineral resources! The production of furs and medicinal materials is also a major export of Xikang. If our government can actively develop Xikang, it will be a limitless source of wealth.</p>
<p>Xikang's industry has also made significant progress in recent years. In Ya'an, there is a provincial woolen mill that exports products to various provinces in China. Tanneries can produce shoe leather, leather clothing, and patterned leather. The newsprint produced by paper mills is sold to Chengdu and other places. The scale and effectiveness are quite impressive. In addition, there are also timber mills and alcohol factories, all of which have achieved good results.</p>
<p>Mongols who migrated south to Xikang have been completely assimilated by the Tibetan Muslims. Those who remained in the "Horzhang" area, not developing southward with the majority, have assimilated into the Donggan Hui, but like their counterparts on the banks of the Xianqu River, they have only been partially assimilated. They live on the east bank of the Daxia River between Lanzhou and Linxia, under the jurisdiction of Linxia County, only twenty miles from Linxia County. Centered in Suonanba, they fully believe in Islam, and their living habits are completely indistinguishable from those of Muslims. From the white hats worn by men and the headscarves worn by women, and their strict adherence to Islamic rules, one would undoubtedly be convinced that they are Donggan Hui people. This can also be called a unique ethnic group within Xikang.</p>
<p>Agricultural Products No Less Than Jiangnan</p>
<p>On the edge of Xikang, there is also a very unfamiliar area, Ningxia. Although it once had a period of brilliant historical memories, for thousands of years, Ningxia has been buried in the mountains on the frontier, silently failing to attract the attention of the Chinese people. It was not until the end of the Anti-Japanese War that its strategic importance, the rapid changes in the world situation, and the shifting of the domestic war situation, along with the completion of the Leixi and Xixiang highways, that it became an important rear military and political area. Xichang, the capital of Ningxia, became the center of military and political affairs on the southwestern border, rivaling Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, and Guiyang, becoming a cornerstone of the anti-Japanese war in the rear. Therefore, it can be seen that it occupies a very important position in the southwest's national defense, industry, and transportation, especially with its large population and endless mineral resources. Geographically and in terms of national defense, it serves as the boundary between Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan provinces, and connects India and Burma, becoming the throat of international transportation lines. Ningxia was originally part of Sichuan. When Xikang Province was established in the 28th year of the Republic of China, it was placed under Xikang under the principle of "Sichuan assisting Xikang," becoming one of the most essential parts of Xikang along with Ya'an. Most of the residents are Lisu, with Han Chinese and Tibetan interspersed among them. Ningxia's agricultural products are no less abundant than the prosperous areas of Jiangnan provinces. Due to the mild climate, all kinds of products are available, and the sericulture industry, in particular, has a very promising future.</p>
<p>How to Develop Xikang</p>
<p>From a cultural perspective, one cannot entirely praise this overly religious culture with bias, but one cannot deny its inherent beauty. For example, in recent years, border education has always tried to instill our set of values into a nation with different tastes, neglecting their inherent values. Therefore, the effort is doubled, but the result is nil!</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation of Xikang, although their material civilization is far inferior to other provinces, their spiritual civilization has undeniable greatness. Today, we must no longer close our eyes and say that the Tibetan culture of Xikang is inferior; we can only say that their culture is somewhat different from ours. They are also cells of the great Chinese nation. In the future, how to integrate and exchange the cultures of this large group of people, and how to develop and prosper this uncultivated virgin land, is a matter that cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of Fujian-Southern Clan Fighting (Continued)</h3>
<p>Legend has it that during the Qing Dynasty, a county magistrate used the method of "killing to stop killing" to curb clan fighting, killing more than a dozen troublemakers at once. As a result, those who were fond of fighting changed their colors upon hearing this and dared not cause trouble again. Unfortunately, there were few officials of this kind. More often, when an official took office or when clan fighting was brewing, they would post a strict prohibition notice as usual. Afterward, they would either close their eyes and ignore it, or act tough or soft, pretending and feigning, taking the opportunity to make a "clan fighting fortune." The ignorant people saw through the weaknesses of the officials, despised the power of the law, and acted recklessly. This method of indulging evil and fostering trouble is one of the reasons for the rampant clan fighting.</p>
<p>After clan fighting occurred, public mediators would come out to run around and mediate as usual. Even if they controlled the official's residence, or the officials took the initiative to investigate and arrest people, in the end, every case was settled by the public mediators. These people who acted as public mediators were mostly "fan" figures (those who are good at inciting), unscrupulous gentry, and the like. Once they became clan fighting mediators, both sides had to send straw sandal fees, activity fees, and thank-you money. Moreover, no matter which side they went to, they could enjoy sincere offerings, often including large dishes, meat, old wine, opium, mahjong, prostitutes... Because the benefits were great and they enjoyed a lot of happiness, they almost became "professional mediators." For every clan fighting incident, they not only hoped that it would last for a long time or become bigger and bigger, but they would even create waves out of nothing, or make a mountain out of a molehill, deliberately provoking. These people, nominally mediators, are actually criminals, and they should bear part of the responsibility for the inability to eradicate clan fighting.</p>
<p>Clan fighting is a business with the purpose of killing people, but it is also an expensive business. Money is no less important than manpower in clan fighting. Having more men means daring to fight, and at the same time, having more money means being able to launch a clan fight with confidence. Weapons and equipment require money, dealing with public mediators requires money, compensating for injuries and deaths requires money, hiring people to go to jail requires money, and bribing the government requires money... and a huge sum of "life money" must be prepared to kill people. Money is indeed the guarantee of victory in clan fighting. In Fujian-Southern, because there are many overseas Chinese and many remittances from abroad, many people who like clan fighting think this way: "Violating the national law can be dealt with by national currency. If money is spent, people will be fine. What's the big deal with continuing!" Whenever clan fighting occurs, they levy funds heavily in the villages (in fact, most of this is overseas remittances), and telegraph their relatives in Southeast Asia to report an emergency. In their minds: "We who are in the village work hard and risk our lives, and you who are abroad should provide the money." And because overseas Chinese have a strong sense of homeland, they cannot bear to see their hometown suffer losses, so they often respond to every request. In this way, "overseas Chinese money" and "Eastern and Western Buddhas" become the left and right arms of clan fighting.</p>
<p>Clan Fighting Revived</p>
<p>In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, Qian Dongliang, the brigade commander of the garrison in Fujian-Southern, was a tough guy. He always adopted the method of "using heavy punishment in times of chaos" to maintain social order. Once, when "Eastern and Western Buddhas" in Jinjiang were brewing a conflict, he had all the idols, large and small, in the county's temples gathered and burned. For clan fighting, there was also a warning of "no mercy." At that time, the people's patriotic enthusiasm was high, and they paid less attention to personal disputes. Then, overseas remittances were cut off, prices soared, and society generally became impoverished. Without fuel, clan fighting naturally could not ignite.</p>
<p>However, after the victory, clan fighting "revived." This, of course, has its reasons.</p>
<p>First, eight years of wartime life were really too depressing. Now that everyone has taken a breath, they are in the mood to recall the past. As a result, trivial hatreds and disputes accumulated during the war are all brought together, wanting to make a big deal out of a small matter through clan fighting.</p>
<p>Second, overseas remittances are flowing smoothly, and life is relatively stable, so there is no shortage of capital for clan fighting. And with the prevailing wind of welcoming gods and temple fairs, disputes between Eastern and Western Buddhas become more frequent.</p>
<p>Third, returning overseas Chinese have brought back a lot of American weapons. These things are good Pipa hanging on the wall. If they are not played, they feel unwilling. Taking them to fish, hunt birds, or shoot into the sky is really unbearable, so they have to find an opportunity to perform and show off. And the heroes who like to fight feel even more confident about these weapons, so they have more confidence in launching clan fighting.</p>
<p>The Fu and Huang families in Yanshanbao, Huizhou Town, Nan'an, had a clan fight due to cowherds grazing their cattle across the border. Both sides borrowed guns, dug trenches, and sent out posts to their clan villages and allied villages for help. At one point, they opened fire, and gunshots were heard everywhere. The Fu family also accidentally detonated a self-made bomb, injuring two people.</p>
<p>The two villages of Panhu and Jiupu in the southern suburbs of Jinjiang also had a clan fight because cattle unintentionally trampled on some crops. It was extinguished several times, but then revived due to trivial matters. Incidents of intercepting and beating people were frequent. The last time, it involved more than a dozen villages of "Eastern and Western Buddhas," full of murderous intent, and the situation was turbulent. Traffic in the southern suburbs was cut off until the commissioner and county magistrate heard the news and brought a large number of county defense forces and police to the countryside to suppress it.</p>
<p>The Jiang and Wu families in Shishi District, Jinjiang, had a falling out because they thought that opening a tombstone was harmful to "feng shui." This not only involved the entire Jiang and Wu families in southern Jinjiang and "Eastern and Western Buddhas," but even the Wu family in the neighboring county of Nan'an sent representatives to participate, causing a "city-wide disturbance." On the most tense days, even the upstairs of the shops in Shishi Street was fitted with machine guns, which was truly terrifying. It was about to break out. Fortunately, the authorities sent personnel and troops to suppress the situation and persuaded them to stop fighting, so there was no major chaos.</p>
<p>The Zhang and Wang families in Luoyang Town, Hui'an, had a dispute over land encroachment caused by the relocation of ancestral graves, which also brewed into a battle from the destruction of graves with weapons. Later, the government sent a team to arrest some people on the ground, and the fighting spirit was thereby extinguished.</p>
<p>The Su and Chen families in Tong'an also had repeated clan fighting because they thought that building an ancestral hall was harmful to "feng shui." A month ago, the situation escalated, involving four or five townships, mobilizing tens of thousands of men to prepare for war. Even when the commissioner's office sent troops to suppress the situation, the villagers' sentries shouted passwords at the officers and soldiers, preventing them from advancing. The entire Tong'an was in a state of high alert. The authorities in Tong'an, fearing that bandits would take the opportunity to cause trouble, implemented a night curfew and ordered shops to close early under police supervision. This state of affairs took half a month to calm down under the active handling of the authorities.</p>
<p>Cow grazing, tomb sites, ancestral halls, "feng shui"—these extremely small or insignificant things actually stir up clan fighting, which is resolved by means of bloodshed and murder. How can this not make people laugh and cry!</p>
<h3>Folk Song Laboratory - Performance Notes of the Suixing Society</h3>
<p>— Chen Shufeng</p>
<p>[Guangzhou Dispatch] The spark of folk songs was initially ignited by the Anti-Japanese War. Before this, due to the advocacy of Xia Libin, Chinese-style tunes gradually appeared in the Chinese music scene. However, what was called Chinese-style at that time mostly referred to composing with a pentatonic scale. Liu Xue'an wrote the most works of that time, such as "Fallen Petals," "Spring Night Sounds of Flutes in Luoyang," etc. But the tunes that time, apart from the pentatonic scale (although "Hearing the Flute" has a seventh note) still used the Western concepts of major and minor scales. The termination of the music still ended on the tonic of the major scale, not daring to write things in the Re mode, or other modes. Therefore, the things written in the early stage sounded a bit like Chinese tunes, but they were not authentic enough, or they could be said to be only like very elegant recitations by literati. "Hearing the Flute" is in this style.</p>
<p>At the same time, rhythm is of course also included. Huang Jinwu's "Three Wishes of the Rose," "Farmers' Joy," Xue Ting's "Fallen Petals," "Spring Night Sounds of Flutes in Luoyang" were essentially Western rhythms, so the Chinese flavor was diluted.</p>
<p>After this period passed, the Anti-Japanese War came, and folk songs exploded in the masses, or it can be said that they blossomed again. "Lugou Answering" used the Little Herdboy tune (arranged by Tian Cong), "Qin Qiong Visits Friends" (lyrics by Tian Cong) used the Pear Syrup Candy tune, and spread very quickly. The work of exploration deepened even further. In the third year of the Anti-Japanese War (1939), the Guangxi song "Pomegranate Green" was also notated. These coming to the Chinese music scene were of course like fresh fruits, full of sweet juice.</p>
<p>Folk Songs in Concerts</p>
<p>But before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, folk songs were mostly used by political work teams for propaganda. In the year approaching victory, some unconventional vocal music students took folk songs to study (that was still during the Qingmuguan era of the Conservatory of Music and its branch). At that time, the professors did not show much interest in folk songs. The "inner ears" of the vocal music professors were filled with sounds like opera, and they had not yet discovered the beauty of the sounds of folk songs. Until one time, a folk song concert was held, and almost every song was well received and asked to be sung again. The vocal music professors then began to pay attention to folk songs. Later, the students held many singing method seminars, slowly looking for their own national form of singing. Last time, Huang Yuanyin's work in the Northwest was one of his own efforts to discover singing methods. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>20,000 Tons of Rice Arrive in Shanghai Today - Determined to Complete the Emergency Transport in Four Days - Allocate 300 Trucks to Transport and Store in the Racecourse</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Although Shanghai's food problem is serious, fortunately, the Municipal Government's Food Purchase and Storage Committee, the US Economic Cooperation Administration, the US Aid Committee, the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, and state-owned banks have closely cooperated and worked together to overcome various difficulties. The total amount of rice and flour currently held by the government in Shanghai is more than 50,000 tons, and private grain reserves also reach about 40,000 tons. It can be seen that the city's grain reserves are still sufficient. The city's food supply has not been interrupted. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haitian vessel, loaded with more than 8,754 tons of rice from Bangkok, the Haile vessel, loaded with 8,875 tons of rice from Yangon, and the Hongzhang vessel, loaded with 2,141 tons of rice from Bangkok, are coming to Shanghai separately. The Haitian and Hongzhang vessels contain US aid rice from the Economic Cooperation Administration, while the rice loaded on the Haile vessel was purchased by the China Trust Bureau and is also rationed rice. The Haitian and Haile vessels are scheduled to arrive at Tongsha at 6:00 PM yesterday, and the Hongzhang vessel is expected to arrive at Tongsha this morning. The three vessels will enter the port together this morning. The Haitian and Haile vessels will dock at the Zhanghuabang Railway Wharf for unloading, and the Hongzhang vessel is scheduled to dock at the Wusong Naval Wharf for unloading. After discussions between the Food Purchase Committee, the US Economic Cooperation Administration, the Municipal Government, and the Garrison Headquarters, it was decided to dispatch approximately 300 trucks to Wusongkou. Under the protection of the military and police and the supervision of representatives from various agencies, they will be transferred to the urban area and stored in the racecourse. This work will begin this afternoon and will continue day and night, and it is expected to be completed in four days. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has approved the Food Purchase Committee's grain funds, most of which have been paid by state-owned banks, so the committee has been able to purchase and store a portion of flour. Furthermore, the relief rice shipped from the United States by the Economic Cooperation Administration has also set off for Shanghai and should arrive in Shanghai if the situation does not change. The large amount of food controlled by the government is a guarantee that the city's household rations will continue uninterrupted. Currently, the expectation of all parties is that government agencies will continue to work hard to purchase and store food while the supply is still open, and implement fair distribution when necessary so that all six million citizens can be free from the fear of shortage, and especially provide practical guarantees for the poor people who are unable to hoard food.</p>
<h3>Preventing Rationed Rice Fraud - Dispatching Personnel to Intensify Supervision</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] According to the People's Livelihood Investigation Office: the second phase of rice rationing per capita in May began on the 23rd of this month and ended on the 26th. The rationed food is divided into three types, and the rationed prices are different, which makes it easy for unscrupulous rice shops to commit fraud, embezzle public property, and exploit citizens. At this time of crisis, it must be strictly investigated and dealt with. In addition to the supervisory committee members, district commissioners, and field investigators of the office intensifying supervision, a public notice has been issued asking citizens to pay attention to reporting at any time, and it is hoped that all rice shops will abide by the law and refrain from committing crimes.</p>
<h3>The Second Half of This Year's Land Value Tax - Scheduled to Begin Collection on the 26th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] For this city's Huangpu, Fahua, Hunan, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Caojing, and Tangqiao districts, the Land Administration Bureau has been ordered to begin collecting the land value tax for the second half of this year on the 26th. The tax amount is collected according to the resolution of the Senate and the instructions of the mayor, based on the base number of August 19, 1948, adjusted according to the latest public utilities pricing index of 680,000 (originally planned to be adjusted according to the cost of living index, but because the cost of living index for this period is 1,740,000, to take into account the burden on businesses, it was approved by Mayor Chen to temporarily adjust according to the public utilities index). After receiving the payment notice, businesses should pay within five days. If the tax is paid after the deadline, a fine of 5% will be added every day, and the adjustment will be made according to the index at the time of payment.</p>
<h3>The Finance Bureau Hopes Residents Will Pay the Spring Quarter House Tax and Construction Tax Quickly</h3>

<h3>Fixed-Amount Banknotes Recalled; National Bank Begins Redemption Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The redemption of fixed-amount banknotes issued by the Central Bank began yesterday. The bank believes that its existing cash and silver dollars are sufficient to meet the needs of currency circulation. Furthermore, counterfeit 500,000 yuan fixed-amount banknotes have been discovered. Therefore, since last week, the bank has only been accepting but not issuing these banknotes, and yesterday it began a comprehensive redemption program. It is reported that the total value of fixed-amount banknotes issued by the bank is around 3 trillion yuan, with the highest denomination being 5 million yuan. The purpose of starting the redemption is to expedite the return of the fixed-amount banknotes, not to indicate that these banknotes have been taken out of circulation.</p>
<p>[China United Press] The address for redeeming banknotes at the Central Bank is on the third floor of the Central Bank vault at 15 The Bund. A large number of people went to redeem the banknotes, but due to the curfew on The Bund, people entered and exited through the side door of the Central Bank next to Er Ma Road. The Central Bank had considered moving its office to the Bank of Communications building on Nanjing West Road due to the inconvenient traffic on The Bund. However, because the structure of the Treasury and two other bureaus are too massive and difficult to move, the bank continued to operate at the original address yesterday.</p>

<h3>Postal Transport Relies Entirely on Air; Citizens Urged to Affix Sufficient Airmail Postage for Mail Sent to Various Locations</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the start of the Battle for Greater Shanghai, external transportation from the city has become increasingly difficult. The postal authorities, recognizing the importance of their mission, have been trying their best to maintain the smooth flow of postal routes despite the extreme difficulties. Currently, the main postal transport relies entirely on air transport. However, the airlines' flights have no fixed schedules. Therefore, the post office has stationed personnel at each airline to maintain constant contact so that the post office can immediately load mail onto any flight that departs. Therefore, the post office urges citizens to use airmail as much as possible when sending mail and to affix sufficient airmail postage. Currently, airmail from the city to Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, the Northwest, Southwest, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces is sent to Guangzhou and then forwarded to various locations. International mail is sent to Hong Kong for forwarding to Europe and the United States, and to Taiwan for forwarding to Japan.

<h3>All Citizens Unite to Fight Against the Invisible Enemy; Mayor Broadcasts the Significance of Expanding the Cleanliness Campaign</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Mayor Chen broadcasted to the city's citizens at 6:00 PM yesterday on Shanghai Radio, titled "The Significance of Expanding the Cleanliness Campaign." The full text of the broadcast is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow Citizens: The Battle for Shanghai has entered its second ten days. At this time and place, advocating for a cleanliness campaign is of great significance. We know that the invisible enemy and the visible enemy must both be defeated. With the cooperation of our military and civilians, we are very confident in defeating the visible enemy. But there is also an invisible enemy that the naked eye cannot see, which is germs. They can also destroy our lives and property. Therefore, we must defeat them and eliminate them. Therefore, this expanded cleanliness campaign is undoubtedly a part of defending Greater Shanghai. I hope that all 6 million of our citizens will work hard to participate, so that it can be coordinated with the fighting and killing of the enemy in the war, and achieve great success. Shanghai, is the fourth largest metropolis in the world, and is the center of industry and commerce in our country. Its current status is even more important, but because the population is too dense, some citizens have not yet developed public health habits, so in terms of cleanliness, it is not yet comparable to major cities in various countries. Every year, as summer approaches, germs multiply, which easily causes epidemics, and the lives of citizens are seriously threatened. According to statistics, sometimes more people die from diseases than from the battlefield, which is no exaggeration to call them invisible enemies. Germs are produced by unclean drinking water, food, and air environment, and the most important reason is the improper disposal of garbage, feces, and sewage. Shanghai has a population of 6 million, and produces more than 3,000 tons of garbage every day. In addition, during the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy and puppets swept but did not transport the garbage, and more accumulated. After the victory, although a lot of money was spent to remove more than 600,000 tons of accumulated garbage, due to manpower, material resources, financial resources, and the inconvenient transportation on the Suzhou River, the cleaning work was difficult to achieve the intended ideal. Since then, expanding the cleanliness campaign, the first goal is to clean up the garbage, the main base of these germs. This matter is of great importance, and it must be completed with the full cooperation of all citizens. The second goal is to have everyone pay attention to the hygiene of one person and one family, and pay more attention to public health, and develop good cleaning habits. Because the uncleanliness of one person endangers the lives of most people, their sin is unforgivable. In short: The purpose of this expanded cleanliness campaign is to hope that all our citizens will unite to put out our invisible enemies. The municipal government will do everything possible and work together. In addition to mobilizing the Sanitation Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Civil Affairs Bureau, and the Public Works Bureau, and launching a large-scale cleanup through Baojia leaders, it also requires all citizens to pay attention to cleaning and hygiene automatically and persistently in order to achieve our intended hope. Cleanliness is a necessary condition for obtaining health, and health is the greatest wealth of people, which everyone should strive for. Compatriots, work hard, work hard to defeat the visible enemy, and work hard to defeat the invisible enemy, work hard to win victory, work hard to win health, and finally wish you all good health.</p>
