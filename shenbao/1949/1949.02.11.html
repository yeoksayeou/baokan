<p>〔本報南京十日電〕參謀總長顧祝同，前因公赴滬，十日下午乘機返抵京。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海和平代表團顏惠慶等一行，原定十一日晨十時飛平，與中共方面作初步接觸，迄昨日午夜，此間雖未得平方改期之長途電話通知，但因氣候關係，代表團又決定延至十三日啓程。昨臼各代表均忙於摒擋私事，未舉行會議。又外傳中共有照會致李代總統，耍求京滬區局部和平，記者詢之甘氏，據謂：完全不確，中共旣未提出照會，亦從未要求局部和平，而在代總統之地位，只能討論全面和平，不能考盧局部和平。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十日電〕據李代總統左右稱：李氏由滬返京後，仍未少减其與共軍謀和之決心。惟共方不願指定正式談判之地點及時間，不免使李氏完成結東內戰任務之希望黯淡。聞李氏及其左右對廣州政府要人所發表之言論，正在逐字研究，李氏並力請行政院或至少一部份人員於十五日左右來京舉行會議，研究當前局勢，決定應採何種步驟，使現在京粵之兩派對未來政策一致。</p>

<p>〔合衆社紐約九日電〕世界電信報九日社論，要求白宮將美國對華態度加以澄淸。該社論稱，現有顯著證明，「共黨向廣州南進時，將遭遇實際抵抗」。社論並指出中國政府可能遷往台灣。該社論間稱：美國對總部在台灣的中國政府將持何熊度或美國是否將支持華南對共黨的抵抗？該社論並警告承認在華的共黨政權，據稱：「如吾人承認一共黨或有共黨的聨合政府，則吾人不能反對將安理會的中國席位讓給共黨，此處並有日本賠償問題，如候使吾人承認共黨政府，則一切賠款及物資移交，均將給與共黨，難道吾人將把日本軍火廠及支持戰爭的工業移交給共黨嗎？國務院對這些問題發表一政策宣言已其時矣」。</p>
<p>〔聨合社本市訊〕美國正在積極減少在中國海岸之駐軍，其原因，經濟與政治兼而有之，現已分曉。新進一批青刀美海軍陸戰隊之撤退，已使美國在華駐軍僅剩兩運左右，青刀與上海各一連，留駐部隊均在艦上，以免侵犯中國主權之口實。同時，美國駐華軍事顧問團憂已於上月結束，大部份團員均已離華。但中國水面尚有龐大美海軍，大部份均在艦上，日前黃浦江中駐有英國巡洋艦一艘，美國巡洋艦一艘，法國經巡洋艦一艘，英國驅逐艦兩綫，美國運輸艦一艘，船上有美兵六百各。南京江面亦有美艦與英艦各一艘，上海美僑對於靑島美國海軍陸戰隊之撤退，並不過份焦慮，以關島與冲繩近在咫尺，援軍兩日內可達。</p>
<p>〔聯合社靑島入日電〕美國海軍陸戰隊士兵一千六百名，入日分乘運輸艦「安里哥」及「倫斐爾」號出發，其中至少一部份將開回桑第哥港。美國西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾登「安里哥」艦出發前，特向海軍陸戰隊司令湯麥斯道別，目前靑島美海軍已减至僅剩一連，其中大部份均留駐艦上，僅少數在岸上兵營中，留艦美兵仍以保護美國財產爲任務。白氏認爲靑島與上海各駐睦戰隊一連，己足應付萬一之變。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廣播，陝北中共電臺十日廣播：「各種事實顯示，美國政府在計劃積極援助國民黨反動派。美國陸軍部長羅雅爾，國防部作戰計劃處處長魏德邁和其他美國政府及陸軍部高級官負多人，本月一日到東京，和美國駐日佔領軍統帥麥克阿瑟，美國駐國民黨政府聯合軍事顧問團團長巴大維等舉行關於擴大援助國民黨反動派垂死掙扎的陰謀會議。差不多同時，美國太平洋艦隊司令藍姆賽在本月四日到了上海，六日到靑島，七日美國駐南京偽政府大使司徒雷登也飛到靑島，和藍姆賽以及美國西太平洋艦隊司令白吉爾等舉行秘密商談。八日藍姆賽已從靑島飛到東京，參加羅雅爾所召開的會議。據確息：司徒雷登，白吉爾和巴大維都主張積極援助國民黨反動派的殘餘力量，並且耍蔣介石在最近期間重新公開登塲，領導反對中國人民的內戰。美國國會和政府的負責人員如美國國會援外監督聯合委員會主席麥卡倫，最近也紛紛發出擴大援助國民黨的叫蠶，因為他勿看了美國帝國主義在中國的侵略勢力，眼看就要全部滅亡了，他們一手導演的假和平陰謀，也遭到了中國人民的無情打擊，所以繼續進行政治陰謀的同時，又重新鼓吹擴大援助國民黨反動派，但是，人民相信：不論美國帝國主義下怎樣的賭注，都一定要被偉大的中國人民贏得乾乾淨淨」。</p>
<h3 id="c19">美陸軍部揭露　二次世界大戰前夕警人國際間諜案　蘇間諜竊取日重要情報　融犯罪與小說一爐讀之如觀連續影片 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕陸軍部今日公佈麥師自東京遞來之報告書，長達三萬二千字，揭露蘇聯在遠東之國際間諜案。該批高等間諜在第二次世界大戰爆發前夕，竊取日本內閣與東京德國大使館機密文件，探知德國將進攻蘇聯而日本決不出此，使蘇聯得從容調遣西伯利亞駐軍至莫斯科阻止德軍前進，挽回戰局。此一問諜網組織完美，胆大如天，爲歷史上所未有，全部案情駭人聽聞，融犯罪與小說於一爐，讀之如觀好萊塢連續影片。重要人犯大半作古，首領德人沙奇與助手日人尾畸均被絞決，但尙有餘黨逍遙法外，置跡各大都會，美國女作家史沫特萊即其中之一，一九二九至一九三三年間伊在上海拉攏沙奇與尾畸合夥。</p>
<p>（按：關於沙尾兩人的合夥，合衆社的電訊，有較詳細的記載：尾畸的加入沙奇間諜團，即由於史沫特莢的介紹，時在一九二九年底或一九三〇年初，尾畸正担任東京「朝日新聞」的駐上海記者，他先和上海的中國左傾文人的組織「創造社」發生關係，以後又通過中國共產靑年團，得與中共在上海的顧問及領袖接觸，那時他常常到蘇州河附近的一家書店去蹓　，由於書店主人魏特邁夫人的介紹，認識了史沫特萊小姐，從此他開始了間諜生涯，後來史沫特萊在南京路某飯店裹佈署了一個約會，把一個名叫「約翰遜」的歐洲人介紹給他，取得聯絡，一直到六年以後，當他在一九三六年從美國回國，以日本代表的身份參加太平洋關係協會主催的一次會議，他才知道約翰遜的眞名，他就是沙奇，因爲一個荷蘭代表替他介紹約翰遜，但是稱之爲：查理沙奇。）</p>
<p>另有德人斯坦因現殆歸化美國，當時亦係該黨要員。履歷不詳，僅知其與史沫特萊均對中國寫過書籍，（按：斯坦因會著「赤色中國的挑戰」一書）據人名錄所載，彼等之通信處在紐約市。黨內並無蘇聯人，除少數人外，皆屬日人。多數從犯已蒙開釋，內有久居洛杉磯之日僑宮城，秋山及北林三人。宮城爲藝術家，秋山為翻譯，加入該黨純係生計所迫。北林為女裁縫，最後供出全部真相。間諜綱所獲情報價值貴重，無法估計，彼等在一九四一年夏秋兩季洞悉日美談判之趨勢，並與日本首相近衛文麼密切，但似不知日本將偷製珍珠港，其與美國境內蘇聯間諜有無連絡，報告書並未提及，僅知眾院反美活動委員會去年調查案內有一次要人物亦與此有關。日本政府過去發表之審判經過甚爲簡略，美軍佔領日本後始廉得其實。此次陸軍部公佈始末顯欲警告人民注意國內之間諜，妥加防範。遠東間諜之陰謀事蹟，如火如茶，頗似傳奇，私刑拷打，自製密碼，偽造護照，利用香煙包貯藏之縮小影片傳遞消息，或乘戲院開映時授受金錢，其秘密電台從未在同一地點設立兩次。沙基爲德國共產黨員，冒充納粹，憑籍新聞記者名義，代表弗朗克福時報等四家至東京採訪，暗中活動，德國大使館憂受其控制。渠體格魁梧，　慢殘忍，嗜酒好色一妻在蘇聯，另在美國娶一小學教員作妾。沙基隨時以臼本軍事與工業情况詳細報告蘇聯政府，關於日軍調動興秘密武器之情報，蒐羅豐當，但屬次要性質，渠搜集之情報範圍廣泛，一遍及英美法德等國駐日大使館與荷蘭公使館，日本內閣，陸單省以及報章雜誌街談巷議，逐項整理，微求尾崎與宮城之意見，復從德國大使談話互相印證獲結集結，然後報告莫斯科。寄遞方式不一而足，有時利用無綫電報，有時派專差携帶縮小影片送往上海，有時經由蘇聯大使館轉交。（下接第二版）</p>

<h3 id="c20">議會召開後的日本政局 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>日本新義會定期於二月十一日揭幕組成，依一月廿三日總選結果說來，吉田茂領導的民主自由黨，必將主宰本屆議會；依民自黨在新議會所佔的壓倒優勢說來，吉田之冉度當選首相，當然毫無問題。現在我們所要注意的，是未來的吉田內閣，究是走一黨政府之路，抑或採聯合政府的姿態？它的性質怎樣？它將把未來的日本政治推進到怎樣一個前途？</p>
<p>依日本新憲法規定，內閣首相係由衆議院選舉多數黨的領袖擔任，而衆議院議長一席，依習慣亦由多數黨作主宰，這是日本立法與行政緊密關係的型態。日本衆一院全體議席爲四六六名，一月廿三日總選結果，民自黨以二六〇名以上的議席壓倒所有一切黨派，該黨在法律上取得第一黨地位；依新憲法第六十七條規定選舉首相，民自黨提名選舉的首相，是絕無問題可以推翻的。日本報紙一致僉認吉田三度膺任首相，巳爲必然之勢，而一衆院議長一席，更可能由該黨最高顧問幣原喜重郎出任。所以說，十一日揭幕組成的新議會，其第一件事，便是確定民自黨爲行政與立法的主宰人，未來的政治將爲民自黨爲主導的政治，其他一切黨派，無論是否參加內閣，都不能够在現政權上發生影響或衡爭的力量。</p>
<p>民自黨既有這樣的優勢，上月總選後即應該毫無保留的召集新議會，早日實現第三度吉田內閣。可是事實上，吉田遲遲於二月十一日召開，其原因就是他利用這空隙的時間，儘量設法爭取民主黨的犬養健，懷柔選舉慘敗的社會黨，企圖爭取這群中間偏右的政黨，加入未來的內閣，俾使未來政府在形式上構成聯合政府，使其領導的保守陣綫更加强壯和堅實。由於社會黨競爭失敗後的情緒欠隹，內部陣營發生錯亂，以及民主黨與吉田的權力分配之難匀，犬養健於四臼訪吉田時拒絕了入閣的邀請，吉田頗感彷徨與失望。吉田本爲一位政治野心家，其人言大而誇，目中無人，以他二度組閣聲勢凌人的態度看來，即同一保守趨向的民主黨，也拒絕同他合作，足徵吉田第三度內閣，必將以一黨作基礎，不可能以聯合政府的姿態出現。即使其他小黨參加一二席，吉田對之亦無足輕重的。據日本人士稱，民主自由黨內部力促吉田放棄對民主社會兩黨的聯絡，組織一黨內閣，並認獨裁專制的政府較聯合政府更能推行政令。吉田原有這套思想，這種抱負，所以預料他最後的決斷，仍將受他內部意見的影響無疑。看情勢他的摯友林讓治將再度被任爲副首相，現任工商大臣大屋晋三可能被任爲大藏大臣，其他的人事安排，不過與現內閣二三流人物的陣營相同，完全爲獨裁統制下的低能內閣。像這樣的內閣，要把日本政治推進到「民主政治」，很難使人相信的。</p>
<p>吉田內閣三度出現以後，政治上不可能有革新或整飭，它將以保守的施政方針，一方面鎮壓勞動力量，剝削公務人員，加强對左翼勢力的打擊，一方面將以實行盟總所指示的日本經濟復興九原則爲最高使命，實踐財閥不解體，推進企業管理及產業合理化諸般落伍必的資本主義政策。像這樣的施取，除了復興舊臼本，加深勞動對立以外，對於日本經濟民主化的前途，自然一點也做不到的。因此，最令人可嘆的：日本已經投降三年了，不僅對日和約訂立無期，並且相反的，摧毀了波茨坦宜言留下的原則。現在，舊日本原封不動，新日本無由催生，日本未來前途之惡化，在遠東方面是萬分可憂的一椿事。我們以這樣眼光看吉田內閣之出現，更以這樣眼光注視日本政治的未來。</p>

<p>此一間諜團奉令刺探之目的爲日本兵力，工業發展，對華政策，日本與德美英三國間之外交關係，及軍人干政之程度，尤其着重日本是否企圖進攻蘇聯。尾崎乃朝日新開之記者兼中國通，與日本政府要員敬人有同窗之誼，嗣因友人介紹，擔任內閣中國事務顧問，近衛首相視爲心腹，凡有機密無不就商。另有重要間諜南斯拉夫人伏克里契專司刺探美英法等國大使館消息，伏係南斯拉夫某報記者，後入法國哈瓦斯通訊社服務，與上海路透社編輯柯克斯爲摯交。柯克斯奉派赴日，因越軌採訪事敗被捕，在東京警察局跳窗殞命，伏克里契家中有一攝影實驗塲，由德人克勞森主持，克勞森於一九二入年至哈爾濱會晤蘇聯特務奧特，在美國副領事李蓮斯屈隆私邸闢室兩間，私設電台。李氏本人亦供給情報，旋於一九三五年調任駐蘇格蘭領事，一九四三年卒於墨西哥。</p>
<p>間諜團組織複雜</p>
<p>沙奇僅管理間諜網上層，下層則歸尾崎與宮城二人指揮，黨內有黨，組織複雜，一部份人員甚至不知首領爲誰，一九三九年，沙基向蘇聯報告日本決定擴充裝甲師，並將軍隊悉予機械化。一九四〇年春，報告日本軍火，飛機，汽車及鋼鐵等工廠之生產數目，一九四一年秋，報告日本所有汽油足供海軍兩年與陸軍半年之用，同年五月二十日，緊急報告德國將集中大軍一百七十至一百九十個師於蘇聯邊境，並於六月二十日沿全綫進攻，主要攻勢針向莫斯科，嗣後德軍果於六月二十二日進攻蘇聯，與沙奇報告相差不過兩天，七月二日，，沙奇在日本御前會議閉幕後，又報告蘇方謂日本政府決定侵入越南，奪取基地，七月底與入月初，報告日本動員一百萬人，大部份派往中國。</p>
<p>最重要一個報告</p>
<p>八月底報告德國大使館已對勸使日本在當年對蘇宣戰一節感覺絕望，時因尾崎與近衛友好，深知日美談判經過，沙奇遂於十月十五日提出最後報告，謂臼本已決定南進，西伯利亞邊境不復有遭受關東軍攻擊之虞。並認任務業已完畢，要求召回蘇聯，不意三日後突被日本政府逮捕。被捕原因純出偶然，綠女間諜北林本係日本共產黨員，但沙奇會訓令所屬不得與日共往來，日共領袖伊藤認爲北林久與共黨斷絕關係，恐已改變主張，反對共產，雖不知其確係問諜，遽向警局告發。警局乃於是年九月二十八日逮捕北林，十月間全部就逮。三年後沙奇，尾崎二人被處絞刑，宮城與伏克里契在獄　斃。克勞森被判終身監禁，旋由美軍釋放，現與妻子仍居蘇聯。在中國主持蘇聯問諜團之日人中西亦於上海被捕，判處無期徒刑，經美軍開鷄後，去年四月會參加大選。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十日電〕日本前檢察官玉澤與前司法部專員太田，會參予沙奇案審判，今臼向聯合社記者談稱：前總理東條會謀拯救沙奇出獄，當沙奇被捕後，東條即獲得通知，東條告檢察官稱，忠實之納粹黨員決不甘爲蘇聯間諜，應予釋放。但東條於獲悉沙奇將最機密情報供給克里姆林宮時，即改變宗旨，據抄獲之文件，證明沙奇等會以情報拍給莫斯科紅軍第四司令部。</p>
<p>電影院暗授款項</p>
<p>沙奇等所得經費，起先在美國共產黨在日本各銀行之存款中提取。太平洋戰爭前不久日本實施外匯管制後，沙奇之經費直接取自蘇聯大使館，其方法富於戲劇風味。沙奇所雇之助手按期可自郵政信箱獲得東京某戲院之戲票兩張。該員可偕其夫人同往觀劇，坐在其旁者當爲蘇聯大使館參贊，此人當以裹在報紙中之款項交與該助手。沙奇被捕後第一星期，拒絕招供，但沙奇向德大使呼援失敗後，終於招供。</p>
<p>情報直呈史達林</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十日電〕日本某要人會與己故間諜大師沙奇談話，今日承認一九三九年諾蒙事之役，日軍大敗於蘇軍之手，實爲沙奇造成。據稱，一九三九年春，日本軍人自遠東蘇軍諜報主任婁谷夫將軍方面獲悉重要情報。婁氏某次訪問滿洲時，向日本關東軍參謀部方面之特務人員透露，遠東蘇軍駐紮地點及其他情報。此種情報傳至德國某軍官，該軍官即報告德國大使館親信沙奇。沙奇以全部情報獻給蘇聯總理史達林。結果遠東紅軍各將領撤換，軍隊駐紮地點完全改變，是年五月間關東軍根據所得情報，向滿洲與外蒙交界處之諾蒙亨進攻，認爲該處乃蘇軍防綫最脆弱，定可一戰成功，不料該處防綫非但不弱，且駐有蘇軍九師之多，日軍陷入袋形陣地。殆八月間戰事結束時，關東軍喪失精兵二萬餘名，垂頭喪氣。日軍經過此役教訓，認識蘇軍實力强大，乃改變方針，蓄意南進，造成太平洋之戰。同時日軍亦從此擴大機械化部隊，成立鐵甲師團。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京十日電〕日本某高級官員今日告聯合社記者稱：國際問諜團首領沙奇，係蘇聯共產黨中央委員會直接組織之問諜組所選派。渠於訊問沙奇時始終在塲，沙氏堅稱除中國外，不知在他處是否有同樣之間諜團，但對其本團之組織供述甚詳。蘇聯共產黨中央委員會會組織一秘密情報組，目的在明暸各國內情，並經由共產國際與各國共產黨合作，以援助其問諜團。沙氏等係由中央委員會之秘密情報組直接選擇，但在紅軍第四組所設之間諜學校中訓練工作。該校並訓練無綫電報員，以供傳達情報之用。紅軍第四組彙管輸送諜報至秘密情報組，蘇聯外交公文傳送員則担任以經費接濟間諜團。沙奇等於一九二九年首在中國成立機關，日軍佔領東北，控制華北後，沙奇等在二次世界大戰爆發前數年即將工作中心移至東京。日人尾崎亦係莫斯科秘密情報組所選擇，以與沙奇合作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕陸軍部今日公布：遠東案間諜報告，對於審判之公正，表示驚奇。據稱，日本在戰事方酣之際，捕獲歷來最危險之間諜，竟給予日本法律所規定之種種保護，令人對於日本司法之素質感覺興趣甚至驚奇。同時男女二十名左右犯人中僅兩名判處死刑，亦令人驚異，因依照日本法律，每一被告均有被處死刑可能。</p>
<p>史沫特萊不承認</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約九日電〕米蘇里州的土著，被陸軍部控爲遠東最大間諜團團員的名作家史沫特萊小姐，九日指斥該項指控爲「可卑的謊話」，她指斥準備該項報告的麥帥總部情報人員，係基於一種「邪惡的政治動機」，她在對報界發表的聲明中稱：「我不是也從來沒有爲任何國家担任過蘇聯的問諜及工作人員」。她的律師前聯邦檢察長羅奇並致函陸軍部長羅雅爾，要求「立即撤回此項不負貴及虛偽的攻擊」。</p>
<p>斯坦因拒絕解釋</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十日電〕被陸軍部指控爲沙奇間牒團團員之一的名作家斯坦因，十日拒絕對此有所解釋。當記者與之通電話，詢以是否即陸軍部報告中所稱之斯坦因時，渠答稱：「我想是吧」！當記者詢以對此事的解釋時，他却說：「抱歉得很，現在沒有什麼可設，也許我以後會解釋的」。</p>

<p>〔新亞社東京十日電〕日本戰後第五屆特別國會，將於十一日召集，會期共七十日，至四月三十日閉幕，惟此項會期問題尙須經衆議院正式通過後·始能確定。在此次會議中，首須舉行首相提名及投票表決，其後將暫時休會，以待新內閣組成，民主目由黨旣已獲得衆院之絕對多數議席，則吉田茂之提名通過形式當可順利完成。此問觀察家預料吉田茂此次當堅決組成民主自由黨之單獨內閣，新閣可能在本月內組成，國會復會時期則將在下月初旬。</p>
<p>〔又電〕日內閣十日會舉行臨時閣議，全體閣僚一致決議總辭職，總辭職書將於十一日晨送交國會，以便國會開會後，即根據是項總辭職事實，舉行新首相提名程序。</p>
<p>〔又電〕日民主黨九日會召開顧問會議，會中該黨總裁犬養健會指定保利茂爲新幹事長，千葉三郎爲政務調查會長，稻垣平太郎爲總務會長，福田淸吉爲總務會副會長，該黨已決定在閣外協助民自黨內閣。十一日國會舉行首相提名時，該黨已同意投吉田新首相票，十日下午四時民主黨總裁犬養又會到外務省官邸訪晤吉田，作第二次兩黨首會談。傳犬養有參加吉田新內閣之可能。</p>
<p>〔又電〕民主黨總裁犬養健，十日下午四時半在外相官邸與民自黨總裁吉田會談後，於五時許會同訪麥帥，繼復同返外相官邸賡續會談，內容爲關於統一保守戰綫，聞已有相當成就。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十日電〕吉田首相在他即將重行膺選爲首相的前夕，舉行記者招待會稱：渠「將與共黨作戰到底」。渠稱：渠之民主自由黨的反共政策，將全力予以執行，即使日本共黨在國會中獲得控制權力時亦然。在過去的談話中，吉田從未透露渠對日共的顛覆政府的活動的不安，在某次單獨接見合衆社記者時，當僅表示如美國佔領軍在時機未成熟時即行撤退，則亞洲的共產主義的擴展可能迅即涉及日本。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：蘇聯頃通知四强外次對奧和約會議稱，西方列强拒絕邀請南斯拉夫參加會議，蘇聯認係「最後通牒」。蘇首席代表柴魯平再度要求准許南斯拉夫出席第二天會議，但西方國家堅持，除非柴氏能保證南國可能提出新建議，拒絕其出席會議。</p>
<p>四强外次對於難民問題亦復形成似局，朵魯平主張强迫奧國將估計五十萬難民不管其願意離奧與否一律遣送回國。美代表李培爾謂美國對於强迫遣送難民回國一節，不能同意。英國建議將整個問題自對奧和約中刪除，但柴氏拒絕此舉。西方列强希望九日夜突然到達倫敦之南斯拉夫外次貝勃勒，可能提出有關經濟條文之折表建議。英美二國大使料將於日內與貝氏作非正式商談。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十日電〕美國十日允許作放鬆對奧賠款要求之新努力，此項賠款要求最後殆需由美國納稅人償付。四强討論對奧和約時，蘇聯與南斯拉夫向奧國之要求，係提交四强代表。南國要求賠款一億五千萬美元，蘇聯亦要求此數，且皆欲以美元償付。美代表李培爾深恐此數將搖動本已不穩之奧國經濟。美國正經由馬歇爾計劃劃在援奧，自奧國方面榨出之任何經濟力量，尤其美元，勢將需美國償付。西方國現密切支持有無任何跡象，顯示蘇聯準備不支持南國對奧國之要求。英方人士預料此後二日可顯示此次會議將否成功。</p>

<p>棉布市氣趨堅，市上銀根明緊階鬆，且聞五百元大鈔即將發行，致人心略振，握貨者售意甚懈，各市穩步微升。能頭細布塲外午刻喊九千六百元，中擋細布籌碼尙稀，故騰升較鉅。如喇叭童細布軋漲一百二十元，開市爲入千二百五十元，旋以散多逢高吐售不乏，價乃做小至八千一百元，最後又進展至入千三百元收市。他若B龍頭細布等亦高一百一十元左右，金運妙舞元嗶嘰與四君子元嘰嘰各自八千五百元開出，中途會叩近九千元大關，午收復退至八千五百五十元。雷峯塔元啤嘰　好一百元，以八千三百五十元結局，四君子元直貢入千四百五十元，較前漲起六百五十元。</p>

<p>外匯移轉證開盤堅挺，進八五〇元，出九〇〇元。旋受黑市金鈔價儅升，一路上升，越九關，九三〇元有買戶。洋行帮銀行帮奮力拋出，價遂迂迥下降。午市商業指定銀行進八六〇元，出入九〇元，較昨軋升十元。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Acting President, along with the Second Bureau Chief of the Presidential Office, Huang Xuecun, and his party, returned to Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the 10th. Huang Shaozi, Gan Jiehou, Cheng Siyuan, and others are scheduled to return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang went to Chuanhougang on the morning of the 10th to meet with Acting President Li and made a report.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, who had previously gone to Shanghai on official business, returned to Nanjing by plane on the afternoon of the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Peace Delegation, led by Yan Huiqing and others, was originally scheduled to fly to Peiping at 10:00 AM on the 11th for preliminary contact with the Communist side. As of midnight yesterday, although no long-distance telephone notification of a postponement had been received from Peiping, the delegation decided to postpone the departure to the 13th due to weather conditions. Yesterday, the representatives were all busy with private affairs and did not hold a meeting. Furthermore, there were rumors that the Communists had sent a note to Acting President Li, requesting a local peace in the Beijing-Shanghai area. When the reporter inquired about this with Mr. Gan, he said: "It is completely untrue. The Communists have neither submitted a note nor requested a local peace. In the position of Acting President, only overall peace can be discussed, not local peace can be considered."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] According to sources close to Acting President Li, Li has not diminished his determination to seek peace with the Communist army after returning to Beijing from Shanghai. However, the Communist side is unwilling to designate a formal negotiation location and time, which inevitably dims Li's hopes of completing the task of ending the civil war. It is heard that Li and his associates are studying the statements made by key figures in the Guangzhou government word by word. Li is also strongly requesting the Executive Yuan, or at least a portion of its members, to come to Beijing around the 15th to hold a meeting to study the current situation and decide what steps should be taken to ensure that the two factions in Beijing and Guangdong are aligned on future policies.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 10th] Xi Chulin, the Hunan representative attending the Hankou Peace Promotion Association, returned to Changsha on the 10th. According to reports, the Hankou Peace Association formed a delegation to contact the Communist side. Hunan selected Chou [name unclear], and Elder Li Shucheng of Hubei went to Shijiazhuang in a private capacity to visit Dong Biwu, and it is reported that they have arrived.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Australian Foreign Minister Suggests UN Mediation of Our Internal Conflict; Good Reaction in Beijing Political Circles; Government Official Believes It's Not Too Late <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] According to a cable from Canberra: Australian Foreign Minister Evatt has suggested that the United Nations mediate the Chinese civil war. When the news arrived, the reaction in political circles here was extremely positive. According to a government official who spoke to a reporter: "After the government repeatedly declared its sincerity in seeking peace with the Communists, but was repeatedly rejected by the Communists, the end of the Chinese civil war must be achieved through international mediation. The Australian Foreign Minister's suggestion will undoubtedly be valued and accepted by representatives of various countries attending the United Nations. China has experienced years of war, and the people's livelihood is exhausted, awaiting recuperation, but the civil war broke out not long ago, and the people are suffering unspeakable pain. The United Nations, which was created to resist violence, should not sit idly by and ignore the serious difficulties faced by the Chinese people, who once shared life and death with them. Now, before the Communist side has fully declared its determination to fight to the end, international mediation is not too late. We sincerely hope that the United Nations will seize the opportunity, quickly accept this suggestion, and take effective steps."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Canberra, 9th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt suggested on the 9th, when Parliament began debating foreign affairs, that the United Nations mediate the Chinese civil war. Evatt said: "As far as China is concerned, a long and tragic war has shaken the whole country and prevented the long-suffering people from enjoying the post-war recovery and reconstruction to which they are entitled. Therefore, I believe that we should assist in mediation to achieve a unanimous solution to save countless lives. This is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations. Due to the increasing differences between major countries and the severity of these differences, the United Nations is now particularly needed to take on the task of mediation and reconciliation." Evatt also praised the United Nations for achieving "continuous success." He also stated: "Australia's foreign policy is to continue to support the United Nations and Britain, to maintain the greatest possible cooperation with all countries in the United Nations, to establish regional agreements to promote welfare and prevent disputes that could cause international conflicts, to undertake reconciliation and mediation tasks whenever and wherever necessary, and to provide practical support for the United Nations' economic and humanitarian activities." Evatt also emphasized close cooperation with the United States, stating: "An important part of Australia's foreign policy is to maintain the greatest possible degree of cooperation with the United States, especially in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. The cooperation between Australia and the United States during the war was very close, and this cooperation has been further strengthened today by President Truman and his constructive Marshall Plan." The audience was very crowded when debating foreign policy today. There were many diplomatic representatives from various countries in the gallery, including envoys from China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands. This debate will last for a week, and opposition leader Menzies is scheduled to respond early next week.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Location of Legislative Yuan Reopening Undecided <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The constitutional term of the Legislative Yuan has arrived, but due to the government's move south, it has not yet been able to reopen. The location of the reopening is also subject to different opinions due to the dispersal of legislators in various regions. Legislators remaining in Guangzhou advocate holding meetings in Guangzhou, while legislators remaining in Beijing and Shanghai advocate reopening in Beijing. Currently, most of the staff of the Legislative Yuan have arrived in Guangzhou, which has some impact on the decision of the meeting location of the Legislative Yuan. Acting President Li hopes that the Legislative Yuan can convene in Beijing, as a gesture of support for the overall situation. However, when holding meetings in Beijing, traffic safety and other issues must be considered. It is reported that after Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian returns to Beijing from Guangzhou, he may make a final decision on this matter, so as to resume meetings as soon as possible this month.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Acheson Responds to Reporters' Questions: US Has Always Been Sympathetic to China; Actively Reducing Troops on Chinese Coast <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 9th] At a press conference on the 9th, Secretary of State Acheson was asked whether the United States might issue a statement of sympathy if the Chinese government could unite in South China. Acheson replied: "The United States has always been sympathetic not only to the Chinese people, but also to the difficulties of the Chinese government." He emphasized: "The United States does not need to issue a statement of sympathy. American sympathy will always be a state of mind."</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] The World Telegram published an editorial on the 9th calling on the White House to clarify the US attitude toward China. The editorial stated that there is now significant evidence that "the Communist Party will encounter actual resistance as it advances south to Guangzhou." The editorial also pointed out that the Chinese government may move to Taiwan. The editorial asked: "What attitude will the United States take towards a Chinese government based in Taiwan, or will the United States support resistance against the Communist Party in South China?" The editorial also warned against recognizing a Communist or Communist-linked government in China, saying: "If we recognize a Communist or Communist-linked government, we cannot oppose ceding China's seat on the Security Council to the Communist Party. There is also the issue of Japanese reparations. If we recognize the Communist government, all reparations and material transfers will be given to the Communist Party. Are we going to hand over Japanese armories and war-supporting industries to the Communist Party? It is time for the State Department to issue a policy statement on these issues."</p>
<p>[United Press, Our City News] The United States is actively reducing its troops stationed on the Chinese coast for both economic and political reasons, which are now clear. The withdrawal of a new batch of Qingdao US Marines has left only about 2,000 US troops in China, one company each in Qingdao and Shanghai. The troops stationed there are all on ships to avoid the appearance of infringing on Chinese sovereignty. At the same time, the US Military Advisory Group in China ended last month, and most of its members have left China. However, there is still a large US Navy on Chinese waters, most of which are on ships. A British cruiser, an American cruiser, and a French cruiser were recently stationed in the Huangpu River, along with two British destroyers and an American transport ship carrying 600 US soldiers. In Nanjing's waters, there is also an American ship and a British ship. American expatriates in Shanghai are not overly concerned about the withdrawal of the US Marines in Qingdao because Guam and Okinawa are close by, and reinforcements can arrive within two days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Qingdao, 8th] 1,600 US Marine Corps soldiers departed on the 8th aboard the transport ships "Anrico" and "Renville," at least some of whom will return to San Diego. Commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet Brigadier General Bageley bid farewell to Marine Corps Commander Thomas before departing on the "Anrico." Currently, the US Navy in Qingdao has been reduced to only one company, most of which remain on ships, with only a few in onshore barracks. The American soldiers remaining on the ships are still tasked with protecting American property. Bageley believes that one company of Marines stationed in Qingdao and Shanghai is sufficient to cope with any eventuality.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Communist Radio Station in Northern Shaanxi Broadcasts Criticism of US Aid to China Plan; Accuses it of Continuing Political Conspiracy <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco broadcast, a Communist radio station in northern Shaanxi broadcast on the 10th: "Various facts show that the US government is planning to actively assist the Kuomintang reactionaries. US Secretary of the Army Royal, Director of the Operations Planning Division of the Department of Defense Wedemeyer, and other senior officials of the US government and the Department of the Army went to Tokyo on the 1st of this month and held a conspiracy meeting with General MacArthur, commander of the US occupation forces in Japan, and General Barr, head of the US Joint Military Advisory Group to the Kuomintang government, on expanding assistance to the Kuomintang reactionaries in their dying struggles. At about the same time, US Pacific Fleet Commander Ramsay arrived in Shanghai on the 4th of this month, Qingdao on the 6th, and US Ambassador to the Nanjing puppet government Stuart also flew to Qingdao on the 7th and held secret talks with Ramsay and US Western Pacific Fleet Commander Bageley. On the 8th, Ramsay had flown from Qingdao to Tokyo to attend the meeting convened by Royal. According to reliable information: Stuart, Bageley, and Barr all advocated actively assisting the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries and wanted Chiang Kai-shek to reappear publicly in the near future to lead the civil war against the Chinese people. Responsible personnel of the US Congress and government, such as McCarran, chairman of the US Congressional Joint Committee for Overseeing Foreign Aid, have also recently issued calls to expand aid to the Kuomintang, because they saw that the aggressive forces of US imperialism in China were about to be completely wiped out, and the fake peace conspiracy that they had directed was also ruthlessly attacked by the Chinese people, so while continuing to carry out political conspiracies, they also re-advocated expanding aid to the Kuomintang reactionaries. However, the people believe that no matter what bet US imperialism makes, it will surely be won cleanly by the great Chinese people."</p>
<h3 id="e19">US Army Reveals International Espionage Case on the Eve of World War II: Soviet Spies Stealing Important Japanese Intelligence; A Blend of Crime and Novel, Reading Like a Serial Film <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 10th] The Department of the Army today released a report from McSherry in Tokyo, 32,000 words long, revealing a Soviet international espionage case in the Far East. This group of high-level spies, on the eve of World War II, stole confidential documents from the Japanese Cabinet and the German Embassy in Tokyo, learning that Germany would attack the Soviet Union, but Japan would not. This allowed the Soviet Union to calmly transfer troops stationed in Siberia to Moscow to stop the German advance, turning the tide of the war. This espionage network was perfectly organized and audacious beyond belief, unprecedented in history. The whole case is shocking and combines crime and fiction, reading like a Hollywood serial film. Most of the key perpetrators are deceased. The leader, a German named Sorge, and his assistant, a Japanese named Ozaki, were both hanged, but there are still accomplices at large, hiding in major cities. The American female writer Agnes Smedley is one of them. She recruited Sorge and Ozaki to work together in Shanghai between 1929 and 1933.</p>
<p>(Note: Regarding the partnership between Sorge and Ozaki, the Associated Press dispatch provided more detailed information: Ozaki's joining Sorge's spy ring was due to Smedley's introduction, around the end of 1929 or the beginning of 1930. Ozaki was working as a Shanghai correspondent for the "Asahi Shimbun" in Tokyo. He first became involved with the "Creation Society," a left-leaning literary organization in Shanghai, and later, through the Chinese Communist Youth League, came into contact with advisors and leaders of the CCP in Shanghai. At that time, he often strolled around a bookstore near Suzhou Creek. Through the introduction of the bookstore owner, Mrs. Witke, he met Miss Smedley, and from then on, he began his espionage career. Later, Smedley arranged a meeting at a hotel on Nanjing Road, introducing him to a European named "Johnson," establishing contact. It was not until six years later, when he returned from the United States in 1936 to participate in a conference hosted by the Institute of Pacific Relations as a Japanese representative, that he learned Johnson's real name was Sorge, because a Dutch representative introduced him as "Charlie Sorge.")</p>
<p>Another German, Stein, has apparently been naturalized as an American citizen and was also a key member of the group at the time. His resume is unknown, but it is only known that he and Smedley both wrote books about China. (Note: Stein authored the book "Red China's Challenge.") According to the directory, their mailing address is in New York City. There were no Soviet citizens in the party, and with the exception of a few people, they were all Japanese. Most of the accomplices have been released, including three Japanese residing in Los Angeles for a long time: Miyagi, Akiyama, and Kitabayashi. Miyagi is an artist, and Akiyama is a translator. They joined the party purely out of economic necessity. Kitabayashi is a female tailor who eventually confessed the whole truth. The value of the intelligence obtained by the spy network is inestimable. In the summer and autumn of 1941, they understood the trend of the Japanese-American negotiations and were close to Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, but they did not seem to know that Japan would attack Pearl Harbor. The report did not mention whether they had contact with Soviet spies in the United States, but only that a key figure in the House Un-American Activities Committee investigation last year was also involved in this. The Japanese government's past publication of the trial process was very brief. The truth was not known until after the US military occupied Japan. This public announcement by the Department of the Army is intended to warn people to pay attention to domestic spies and take appropriate precautions. The conspiracy of the Far East spies is exciting, quite legendary. Private torture, self-made passwords, forged passports, the use of cigarette packs to store miniature films to transmit messages, or the transfer of money during theater screenings, their secret radio stations were never set up in the same location twice. Sorge was a member of the German Communist Party, posing as a Nazi, using the name of a journalist to represent four newspapers, including the Frankfurter Zeitung, to interview in Tokyo, secretly engaging in activities. The German Embassy was worried about being controlled by him. He was a burly, cruel man who was fond of alcohol and women. He had a wife in the Soviet Union and another elementary school teacher in the United States as a concubine. Sorge reported the situation of Japanese military and industry to the Soviet government in detail at any time. He collected a wealth of information on the deployment of Japanese troops and secret weapons, but it was of secondary nature. The scope of intelligence he collected was extensive, covering the British, American, French, and German embassies in Japan, as well as the Dutch embassy, the Japanese Cabinet, the Army and Navy Ministries, as well as news articles and street talks. He sorted them out item by item, sought the opinions of Ozaki and Miyagi, and then cross-checked with the German ambassador to reach a conclusion, and then reported to Moscow. The method of delivery varied. Sometimes he used wireless telegraphs, sometimes he sent special messengers to carry miniature films to Shanghai, and sometimes he handed them over through the Soviet Embassy.

<h3 id="e20">The Japanese Political Situation After the Opening of Parliament <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The new Japanese parliament is scheduled to open on February 11th. According to the results of the general election on January 23rd, the Democratic Liberal Party led by Shigeru Yoshida will dominate this parliament. Given the overwhelming advantage of the Democratic Liberal Party in the new parliament, Yoshida's re-election as prime minister is, of course, without question. What we need to pay attention to now is whether the future Yoshida Cabinet will take the path of a one-party government or adopt the posture of a coalition government. What is its nature? What kind of future will it advance Japanese politics to?</p>
<p>According to the new Japanese constitution, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet is appointed by the leader of the majority party elected by the House of Representatives, and the seat of the Speaker of the House of Representatives is also dominated by the majority party by custom. This is the model of the close relationship between the Japanese legislature and the executive branch. The Japanese House of Representatives has a total of 466 seats. In the general election on January 23, the Democratic Liberal Party overwhelmed all other parties with more than 260 seats, and the party legally obtained the status of the first party. According to Article 67 of the new constitution, when electing a prime minister, the prime minister nominated and elected by the Democratic Liberal Party is absolutely impossible to overturn. Japanese newspapers unanimously agree that Yoshida's third term as prime minister is inevitable, and the seat of the Speaker of the House of Representatives may be taken by the party's top advisor, Kijuro Shidehara. Therefore, the first thing the new parliament, which opens on the 11th, will do is to determine that the Democratic Liberal Party is the master of the executive and legislative branches, and that the future politics will be led by the Democratic Liberal Party. All other parties, whether or not they participate in the cabinet, cannot have an influence or compete for power in the current regime.</p>
<p>Since the Democratic Liberal Party has such an advantage, it should have convened the new parliament without reservation after the general election last month and realized the third Yoshida Cabinet as soon as possible. However, in fact, Yoshida delayed the convening until February 11th. The reason for this is that he used this gap to try his best to win over Takeshi Inukai of the Democratic Party, to appease the Socialist Party, which suffered a disastrous defeat in the election, and to try to win over this group of center-right parties to join the future cabinet, so that the future government would formally constitute a coalition government, making his leading conservative front stronger and more solid. Due to the poor mood of the Socialist Party after the competition failed, the internal camp was disordered, and the difficulty of power distribution between the Democratic Party and Yoshida, Takeshi Inukai rejected the invitation to join the cabinet when he visited Yoshida on the 4th, and Yoshida felt quite hesitant and disappointed. Yoshida is originally a political ambitious person, his words are big and exaggerated, and he does not take anyone seriously. Judging from his arrogant attitude in organizing the cabinet twice, even the Democratic Party with the same conservative trend refused to cooperate with him, which shows that Yoshida's third cabinet will be based on one party and cannot appear in the posture of a coalition government. Even if other small parties participate in one or two seats, Yoshida will not take them seriously. According to Japanese sources, the Democratic Liberal Party internally urged Yoshida to abandon contact with the Democratic and Socialist parties and form a one-party cabinet, and believed that a dictatorial and autocratic government could better implement administrative orders than a coalition government. Yoshida originally had this idea, this ambition, so it is expected that his final decision will undoubtedly be influenced by his internal opinions. Judging from the situation, his close friend George Hayashi will be re-appointed as Deputy Prime Minister, and the current Minister of Commerce and Industry, Sango Oya, may be appointed as Minister of Finance. Other personnel arrangements are no different from the second and third-rate figures in the current cabinet, and are completely incompetent cabinets under dictatorial rule. It is difficult to believe that such a cabinet will advance Japanese politics to "democratic politics."</p>
<p>After the third appearance of the Yoshida Cabinet, it is impossible to have innovation or rectification in politics. It will take a conservative policy approach, on the one hand, suppressing labor forces, exploiting public officials, and strengthening the crackdown on left-wing forces, and on the other hand, it will take the implementation of the nine principles of Japanese economic recovery instructed by the Allied Headquarters as its highest mission, practicing the old and outdated capitalist policies of not dissolving the zaibatsu and promoting business management and industrial rationalization. Apart from reviving the old Japan and deepening labor opposition, it is naturally impossible to do anything for the future of Japanese economic democratization. Therefore, it is most regrettable that Japan has already surrendered for three years, not only is the peace treaty with Japan indefinitely delayed, but on the contrary, the principles left by the Potsdam Proclamation have been destroyed. Now, the old Japan is intact, and the new Japan cannot be promoted. The deterioration of Japan's future is a very worrying thing in the Far East. We look at the appearance of the Yoshida Cabinet with this perspective, and we pay attention to the future of Japanese politics with this perspective.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Shocking International Espionage Case (Continued from Page 1) <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of this spy ring's mission was to investigate Japanese military strength, industrial development, policies towards China, diplomatic relations between Japan and Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and the extent of military interference in politics, with particular emphasis on whether Japan intended to attack the Soviet Union. Ozaki was a reporter for the Asahi Shimbun and an expert on China. He had a close friendship with key figures in the Japanese government from their student days. Later, through a friend's introduction, he became an advisor on Chinese affairs to the cabinet, and Prime Minister Konoe regarded him as a confidant, consulting him on all confidential matters. Another important spy, a Yugoslav named Vukelic, specialized in gathering information from the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. Vukelic was a reporter for a Yugoslav newspaper and later worked for the French Havas news agency, becoming close friends with Cox, the editor of Reuters in Shanghai. Cox was sent to Japan, but his unauthorized reporting led to his arrest, and he died after jumping from a window at the Tokyo police station. Vukelic had a photography lab in his home, run by a German named Klausen. Klausen met with Soviet agent Otto in Harbin in 1920 and established two private rooms with a private radio station in the residence of US Vice Consul Li Liansiquan. Mr. Li himself also provided information and was transferred to be Consul in Scotland in 1935 and died in Mexico in 1943.</p>
<p>Complex Spy Ring Organization</p>
<p>Sorge only managed the upper levels of the spy network, while the lower levels were commanded by Ozaki and Miyagi. There were factions within the party, and the organization was complex. Some members did not even know who their leader was. In 1939, Sorge reported to the Soviet Union that Japan had decided to expand its armored divisions and mechanize its army. In the spring of 1940, he reported the production numbers of Japanese munitions, aircraft, automobiles, and steel factories. In the autumn of 1941, he reported that Japan had enough gasoline to supply its navy for two years and its army for half a year. On May 20 of the same year, he urgently reported that Germany would concentrate a large army of 170 to 190 divisions on the Soviet border and launch an attack along the entire line on June 20, with the main offensive aimed at Moscow. Subsequently, the German army did attack the Soviet Union on June 22, only two days after Sorge's report. On July 2, after the closing of the Imperial Conference in Japan, Sorge again reported to the Soviet side that the Japanese government had decided to invade Vietnam and seize bases. In late July and early August, he reported that Japan had mobilized one million men, most of whom were sent to China.</p>
<p>The Most Important Report</p>
<p>At the end of August, he reported that the German embassy had given up hope of persuading Japan to declare war on the Soviet Union that year. Because Ozaki was friendly with Konoe and knew the details of the Japanese-American negotiations, Sorge submitted his final report on October 15, stating that Japan had decided to advance south and that the Siberian border was no longer in danger of attack from the Kwantung Army. He believed his mission was complete and requested to be recalled to the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly arrested by the Japanese government three days later. The reason for the arrest was purely accidental. A female spy named Kitabayashi was a member of the Japanese Communist Party, but Sorge had instructed his subordinates not to associate with the Japanese Communist Party. The leader of the Japanese Communist Party, Ito, believed that Kitabayashi had severed ties with the Communist Party for a long time and was afraid that she had changed her views and opposed communism. Although he did not know that she was indeed a spy, he reported her to the police. The police arrested Kitabayashi on September 28 of that year, and the rest were arrested in October. Three years later, Sorge and Ozaki were hanged, while Miyagi and Vukelic died in prison. Klausen was sentenced to life imprisonment, later released by the US military, and now lives in the Soviet Union with his wife. Nakanishi, a Japanese national who headed the Soviet spy ring in China, was also arrested in Shanghai and sentenced to life imprisonment. After being released by the US military, he participated in the general election last April.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Former Japanese prosecutors Tamazawa and Ota, who participated in the Sorge case trial, told United Press reporters today that former Prime Minister Tojo tried to save Sorge from prison. When Sorge was arrested, Tojo was notified. Tojo told the prosecutors that loyal Nazi members would never be Soviet spies and should be released. However, Tojo changed his mind when he learned that Sorge had provided the most confidential information to the Kremlin. According to seized documents, it was proven that Sorge and others had telegraphed information to the Fourth Headquarters of the Red Army in Moscow.</p>
<p>Secret Payment in Movie Theaters</p>
<p>The funds received by Sorge and others were initially withdrawn from the deposits of the American Communist Party in Japanese banks. Shortly before the Pacific War, after Japan implemented foreign exchange controls, Sorge's funds came directly from the Soviet Embassy, in a dramatic fashion. Sorge's hired assistants could periodically obtain two movie tickets for a certain theater in Tokyo from a postal mailbox. The assistant and his wife could go to see the movie, and the person sitting next to them would be a counselor from the Soviet Embassy, who would hand over the funds wrapped in a newspaper to the assistant. In the first week after his arrest, Sorge refused to confess, but after Sorge's appeal to the German ambassador for help failed, he finally confessed.</p>
<p>Information Sent Directly to Stalin</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] A Japanese official who spoke with the deceased master spy Sorge today admitted that the Japanese army's defeat by the Soviet army in the Nomonhan Incident of 1939 was caused by Sorge. It is said that in the spring of 1939, Japanese military personnel obtained important information from General Rogov, the head of Soviet military intelligence in the Far East. During a visit to Manchuria, Rogov revealed to agents in the Kwantung Army General Staff the locations of Soviet troops in the Far East and other information. This information was passed on to a German officer, who reported it to Sorge, a confidant of the German Embassy. Sorge presented all the information to Soviet Premier Stalin. As a result, the Far Eastern Red Army commanders were replaced, and the locations of the troops were completely changed. In May of that year, the Kwantung Army, based on the information obtained, attacked Nomonhan, a border area between Manchuria and Outer Mongolia, believing that the Soviet defense line there was the weakest and that a successful battle could be won. Unexpectedly, the defense line there was not weak at all, and there were as many as nine Soviet divisions stationed there. The Japanese army was trapped in an encirclement. By the time the war ended in August, the Kwantung Army had lost more than 20,000 elite soldiers and was crestfallen. After learning a lesson from this battle, the Japanese army recognized the strength of the Soviet army and changed its strategy, intending to advance south, which led to the Pacific War. At the same time, the Japanese army expanded its mechanized units and established armored divisions.</p>
<p>Soviet Espionage Group Selection</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] A senior Japanese official told United Press reporters today that Sorge, the leader of the international spy ring, was selected by the espionage group directly organized by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. He was present throughout the interrogation of Sorge, and Sorge insisted that he did not know whether there were similar spy rings elsewhere other than in China, but he provided detailed information about the organization of his own group. The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party organized a secret intelligence group to understand the internal affairs of various countries and cooperated with the Communist International and the Communist parties of various countries to assist its espionage groups. Sorge and others were directly selected by the secret intelligence group of the Central Committee but were trained in the espionage school established by the Fourth Group of the Red Army. The school also trained radio operators to transmit information. The Fourth Group of the Red Army collected and transmitted espionage reports to the secret intelligence group, and Soviet diplomatic couriers were responsible for providing funds to the spy ring. Sorge and others first established an agency in China in 1929. After the Japanese army occupied the Northeast and controlled North China, Sorge and others moved their center of operations to Tokyo several years before the outbreak of World War II. Ozaki, a Japanese national, was also selected by the Moscow secret intelligence group to cooperate with Sorge.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The War Department announced today that the espionage report on the Far East case expressed surprise at the fairness of the trial. It is said that Japan, in the midst of the war, captured the most dangerous spy in history and gave him all the protections provided by Japanese law, which makes one feel interested and even surprised by the quality of Japanese justice. At the same time, it is surprising that only two of the twenty or so male and female criminals were sentenced to death, because according to Japanese law, every defendant could have been sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Smedley Denies</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] Miss Agnes Smedley, a native of Missouri, a well-known writer who was accused by the War Department of being a member of the largest spy ring in the Far East, denounced the allegation on the 9th as a "despicable lie." She accused the intelligence officers at MacArthur Headquarters who prepared the report of acting on the basis of a "malicious political motive." In a statement to the press, she said, "I am not and have never been a Soviet spy or staff member for any country." Her lawyer, former Federal Prosecutor Rogge, also wrote to Secretary of the Army Royall, demanding "the immediate retraction of this irresponsible and false attack."</p>
<p>Stein Refuses to Explain</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 10th] Noted writer Gunther Stein, one of those accused by the War Department of being a member of Sorge's spy ring, refused to comment on the matter on the 10th. When a reporter contacted him by telephone and asked if he was the Stein mentioned in the War Department report, he replied, "I think so!" When the reporter asked for an explanation of the matter, he said, "I'm very sorry, I have nothing to say now, perhaps I will explain it later."</p>

<h3 id="e37">New Japanese Parliament Opens Today - Yoshida Cabinet to Undergo Formal Resignation and Reappointment - Liberal Party Resolves to Implement Anti-Communist Policy <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Japan's fifth special Diet session after the war will convene on the 11th, lasting for a total of 70 days, closing on April 30. However, the issue of this term still needs to be formally approved by the House of Representatives before it can be finalized. In this meeting, the Prime Minister's nomination and voting must be held first, after which the meeting will be temporarily adjourned to await the formation of the new cabinet. Since the Democratic Liberal Party has already obtained an absolute majority of seats in the House of Representatives, the process of Yoshida Shigeru's nomination should be completed smoothly. Observers predict that Yoshida Shigeru will resolutely form a single-party cabinet of the Democratic Liberal Party this time. The new cabinet may be formed within this month, and the resumption of the Diet session will be in the early part of next month.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Japanese cabinet held a temporary cabinet meeting on the 10th, and all cabinet members unanimously decided to resign en masse. The letter of resignation will be submitted to the Diet on the morning of the 11th, so that after the Diet convenes, the new Prime Minister nomination process can be held based on the fact of this mass resignation.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Democratic Party held an advisory meeting on the 9th, in which the party president, Inukai Ken, appointed Hori Shigeru as the new Secretary-General, Chiba Saburo as the Chairman of the Policy Research Council, Inagaki Heitaro as the Chairman of the General Affairs Council, and Fukuda Seikichi as the Deputy Chairman of the General Affairs Council. The party has decided to assist the Democratic Liberal Party cabinet from outside the cabinet. The party has agreed to vote for the new Prime Minister Yoshida when the Diet holds the Prime Minister nomination on the 11th. Inukai, the president of the Democratic Party, also visited Yoshida at the Foreign Minister's residence at 4:00 p.m. on the 10th for the second round of talks between the two party leaders. It is rumored that Inukai may participate in the new Yoshida cabinet.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Democratic Party President Inukai Ken met with Democratic Liberal Party President Yoshida at the Foreign Minister's residence at 4:30 p.m. on the 10th, and then visited MacArthur together at 5:00 p.m. Afterwards, they returned to the Foreign Minister's residence to continue the talks. The content of the talks was about the unification of the conservative front, and it is said that considerable progress has been made.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Prime Minister Yoshida, on the eve of his re-election as Prime Minister, held a press conference, saying that he "will fight the Communists to the end." He said that his Democratic Liberal Party's anti-Communist policy will be fully implemented, even if the Japanese Communist Party gains control in the Diet. In past talks, Yoshida had never revealed his concern about the JCP's subversive activities. In a private interview with a United Press reporter, he only stated that if the American occupation forces withdrew before the time was ripe, the expansion of communism in Asia might quickly involve Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Four Powers Continue Discussion on Austrian Peace Treaty - Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Propose Compensation Claims - Yugoslav Foreign Minister Suddenly Arrives in London but is Refused Attendance at Meeting - Issue of Displaced Persons Reaches Stalemate <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 10th broadcast: The Soviet Union has notified the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference on the Austrian Peace Treaty that the Western powers' refusal to invite Yugoslavia to attend the meeting is considered an "ultimatum." The Soviet chief representative, Tsarapkin, repeatedly requested permission for Yugoslavia to attend the second day of the meeting, but the Western countries insisted that unless Tsarapkin could guarantee that Yugoslavia might propose new suggestions, they would refuse its attendance at the meeting.</p>
<p>The Four Power Foreign Ministers have also reached a stalemate on the issue of refugees. Tsarapkin advocated that Austria be forced to repatriate an estimated 500,000 refugees, regardless of whether they were willing to leave Austria or not. US representative Reber said that the United States could not agree to the forced repatriation of refugees. Britain suggested that the entire issue be removed from the Austrian Peace Treaty, but Tsarapkin rejected this move. The Western powers hoped that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Bebler, who suddenly arrived in London on the night of the 9th, might propose a compromise suggestion regarding the economic clauses. The ambassadors of the United Kingdom and the United States are expected to hold informal talks with Bebler within the next few days.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] The United States allowed a new effort to relax its demands for compensation from Austria on the 10th. The final claim would most likely have to be paid by American taxpayers. The demands of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia on Austria when the Four Powers discussed the Austrian Peace Treaty were submitted to the Four Power representatives. Yugoslavia demanded compensation of $150 million, and the Soviet Union also demanded this amount, and both wanted it to be paid in US dollars. US representative Reber was deeply concerned that this number would shake Austria's already unstable economy. The United States is currently providing aid to Austria through the Marshall Plan, and any economic resources squeezed from Austria, especially US dollars, would have to be paid by the United States. Western countries are closely watching for any signs that the Soviet Union is preparing to not support Yugoslavia's demands on Austria. British sources expect the next two days to show whether this meeting will be successful.</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary Hints in the House of Commons</p>
<p>[British Information Office, London, 10th] Foreign Secretary Bevin refused in the House of Commons on the 9th to guarantee that the United Kingdom would not be drawn into the war as a belligerent in the event of a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. He made this statement in response to a question from Labour MP Chamberlain. Chamberlain asked, "Will the Foreign Secretary provide assurance that the British government's policy based on the proposed Atlantic Pact will not have any clauses that would obligate this country to automatically become a belligerent in the event of a war between the United States and the Soviet Union?" Bevin replied that he did not intend to provide such an assurance.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] The Shipowners' Association resolved yesterday that passenger and freight rates on all lines will increase by 260% of the original price starting on the 11th. Passenger fares for exports from Taiwan will increase by 30%, and freight rates will increase by 20%. According to a person in charge of the Shipowners' Association: This price increase is based on the ratio of prices on the 26th of last month to recent prices. During this period, coal has risen from 4,895 yuan per ton to 22,651 yuan, fuel oil has risen from 8,948 yuan per ton to 41,440 yuan, hardware materials have risen by three to four times, and the cost of living index has risen by about one time.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration, in order to adjust employee salaries and increase revenue, originally decided to automatically adjust passenger and freight rates starting today. Wang Zhaohuai, the director of the administration, spent the entire day yesterday contacting various parties to solicit opinions. Finally, due to the lack of time to complete the procedures, it was decided to postpone the implementation to tomorrow (the 12th). It is said that the adjustment multiple is around 500%.</p>
<p>In addition, the eight major public utilities in this city, including water, electricity, gas, electric lights, trams, buses, small trains, and ferries, have jointly requested the Public Utilities Bureau to adjust prices due to repeated cost increases. Zhao Huijue, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, summoned the persons in charge of each company for consultation at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. The consultation continued until about 5:00 p.m., but there were no significant results. He will summon the persons in charge of each company again today to continue reviewing the new prices. Once approved, he will submit it to the Mayor for approval and implementation.</p>

<p>According to the heads of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Huashang Electric Company, and Pudong Electric Company, the recently adjusted electricity prices, effective from February 1st, are based on a coal price of 5,000 yuan per ton and a foreign exchange transfer certificate price of 171 yuan for cost calculation. Since February 1st, prices have soared, causing each company to use all electricity revenue from January to purchase coal. The difference is significant, and other expenses have no source of funding. Economic difficulties have reached an extreme. They have reached a point of desperation. To effectively remedy the situation, the only solution is to adjust electricity prices along with fluctuations in the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Otherwise, they will be unable to maintain production, and the entire city's supply may be interrupted.</p>

<p>Host Yesterday Received Reporters</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Yichou Salvation and Disaster Relief Dharma Assembly held a reception for reporters from various newspapers at the Cultural Association at 3:00 PM yesterday. First, Huang Hanzhi, Director of the Propagation Group, reported on the purpose of the Dharma Assembly and the preparations made. Then, Lay Buddhist Qu Wenliu, the General Preceptor of the Assembly, explained the true meaning of responsiveness, saying that sentient beings have good roots that trigger opportunities, and Buddhas respond accordingly. This is called responsiveness. The Buddha's light shines universally, without resentment towards relatives or discrimination towards the near or far. The suffering of sentient beings has reached this point because of shared karma, and shared karma must be resolved together. This is why the Assembly is promoting universal repentance among all sentient beings, seeking the benefit of both the visible and invisible realms. Lay Buddhist Hu Houfu expounded on the Buddhist Dharma in great detail. Then, Lay Buddhist Pan Gongzhan explained the true meaning of the Buddhist Dharma, correcting the mistaken notion that "Buddhism is world-renouncing and only seeks personal tranquility and happiness," saying that the Buddhist Dharma is about saving from suffering and disaster, and is a great path of benefiting others and saving people. The highest purpose of this Dharma Assembly is to inspire the world to have benevolent thoughts of saving people. The Dharma Assembly is scheduled to begin on the 15th, establishing a disaster relief Dharma Assembly for 49 days, sincerely praying for disaster relief, world peace, and the happiness of the people. The Chinese Buddhist Association and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission are requested to notify temples throughout the country and in Mongolia and Tibet, as well as Buddhist organizations, to work together for peace and disaster relief.</p>

The reason for the verdict is that the court found that Tong Ge, the principal of the school, failed to investigate the behavior of the teachers he hired, and Lu Shanchang, the head teacher, improperly handled the situation by allowing Shen to take his luggage with him after the fact. However, neither of these actions constitutes a crime in law, so the two defendants Tong and Lu were found not guilty. The victim's mother, Dai Yunsu, requested that the court find a way to bring Shen Qier to justice after hearing the verdict, and left in disappointment.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Several hundred family members of the victims of the sinking of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangya Steamer are demanding compensation, requesting 125 dan of rice be given to each family of the deceased. The company only agreed to 5,000 yuan per household, causing dissatisfaction. On the morning of the 9th, they went to the company to petition and were refused, and the main gate was closed tightly. Representatives were sent to Xu Xueyu's private residence, but he had already moved. The family members waited outside the company gate all day, using dramatic tactics to confront them. At 3:30 PM, two trucks of coffins arrived, and the family members wore mourning clothes, carried incense, and cried, blocking the main gate, back door, and Bund side door of the company with coffins, creating a gloomy and terrifying scene. Traffic was temporarily cut off. At 5:45 PM, company employees wanted to leave work and return home, but seeing the coffins blocking the door, some employees rushed out of the gate. Unexpectedly, one of the coffins was overturned, and the lid opened, revealing that the coffin was empty. At this time, the garrison headquarters and police station flying fortresses had already suppressed the scene, and seeing that it was an empty coffin, they moved it away. The family members were sent back by the company's vehicles, and the police, military, and gendarmerie withdrew at the same time, temporarily ending the confrontation.

<p>The yarn market saw a slight improvement, but credit remained tight. However, hot money from South China continued to arrive, Guangdong merchants showed some interest, and transactions between dealers and weaving factories remained scarce. Fluctuations in each yarn variety were narrow, resulting in only a slight increase of about half a percent.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix initially started at 390,000 yuan, briefly reaching 400,000 yuan, with 400,500 yuan as the highest. Zhu Ji still trended weakly, and ultimately was lower than the opening price, closing at 380,000 yuan, a squeeze of 30,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon retreated from 315,000 yuan to a close of 300,000 yuan, ultimately up 15,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse spot goods opened in the morning at 245,000 yuan, once reaching 255,000 yuan due to short covering, but closed in the afternoon as low as 240,000 yuan, up 20,000 yuan from the previous day. Factory orders were 225,000 yuan, also up 25,000 yuan. One-day arbitrage for 20-count Double Horse narrowed to 10,000 yuan, an improvement of 10,000 yuan.

<p>The cotton cloth market trended firm. Credit in the market was clearly tight but loosening, and rumors that 500-yuan banknotes would soon be issued slightly boosted confidence. Holders were very reluctant to sell, and all markets steadily increased slightly. Dragon Head Fine Cloth was quoted at 9,600 yuan outside the market at noon. The supply of medium-grade fine cloth chips was still scarce, so the price rose significantly. For example, Trumpet Boy Fine Cloth squeezed up 120 yuan, opening at 8,250 yuan, but the price then fell to 8,100 yuan due to ample supply from retailers taking profits at high prices. Finally, it progressed again to a close of 8,300 yuan. Other items, such as B Dragon Head Fine Cloth, etc., were also up about 110 yuan. Jin Yun Miao Wu Yuan Serge and Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge each opened at 8,500 yuan, briefly approaching the 9,000 yuan mark, but retreated in the afternoon to 8,550 yuan. Lei Feng Pagoda Yuan Serge improved by 100 yuan, closing at 8,350 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong was 8,450 yuan, up 650 yuan from the previous day.</p>

<p>The rice market was initially stable, but the middle market strengthened, showing a slight increase. As credit loosened, off-market prices rose slightly, and confidence stopped weakening and became firm. White粳 initially opened at 6,500 yuan and closed at 6,800 yuan. Bo Dao also closed at 6,800 yuan, delivered at 6,900 yuan, each up 300 yuan. Early rice rose from 6,200 yuan to 6,500 yuan, up 400 yuan. Yin Yuan and Rough 粳 both rose 300 to 400 yuan, with the close showing a slight softening.</p>
<p>The flour market lacked the strength to rise, with the market trend initially firm but then retreating. Old Car initially broke the 3,000 yuan mark due to the easing of credit, opening at 3,100 yuan, and closing up at 3,150 yuan. After the close, many holders were willing to sell, and quotations showed a slight decline, around 3,100 yuan. Battleship opened at 2,900 yuan, and the after-market briefly hit the 3,000 yuan mark, with a slight retreat after the close, trading at 2,970 yuan.

Corn sales were sluggish at the beginning of the market, falling by more than 100 yuan, but the after-market was optimistic and slightly rebounded. Peanut holders maintained their prices, and supply was limited. In addition, oil factories absorbed a lot of supply, and the market trend rose sharply by 20%. Nanjing Peanuts hit 12,000 yuan again.</p>
<p>The cooking oil market rebounded again, prices rose, credit tightness eased slightly, confidence also turned firm and stable, off-market prices rose, and retail demand recovered strongly. Soybean oil prices went above 30,000 yuan again, closing at 33,000 yuan, a squeeze of 4,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil rose 3,000 yuan, closing at 27,000 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil was 22,000 yuan. Jibao Raw Oil rose from 35,500 to 37,500 at close, a squeeze of 4,000. Soybean cake initially rose and then softened slightly, squeezing up 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Tea Market Brisk</p>
<p>Since the tea market returned to a restrained stance the day before yesterday, yesterday's market negotiations, although quite active, were perceived by sellers as the credit tightness slightly easing. Furthermore, because tea inventories had not increased, they stubbornly held onto their goods, reluctant to let go, so the outcome of negotiations between the two sides remained unsatisfactory. Transactions were sporadic, and not many deals were made, but the market still appeared brisk, and prices showed signs of improving.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Silk Recovers <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>

Yesterday, credit in the market slightly eased, and overnight interest rates initially rose and then fell back. Floor rates initially did six corners, then did not reach five corners. At the noon close, each counter showed slight improvement. 120 Tianqiao was initially called at 350,000, and in the middle, upon hearing that gold prices were still good and that off-market prices showed slight gains, the trading floor started to hype the price again, briefly reaching 365,000 yuan. Holders took advantage of the high prices to sell, but ultimately sales were not smooth, and the trend softened again. Quotations retreated from the peak. Near noon, the current-day balance was settled at 340,000 yuan, up a slight 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot price of raw silk with foreign exchange transfer certificate slightly rose, and confidence turned firm. After the opening, premium grade was offered at 350,000 yuan, and buying interest was still strong. The price then rose, closing near 370,000 yuan at noon, up 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Continuing the weakness of the previous day, the silk and satin market opened at a lower level. After seeing Meiya open at 210,000 yuan, upon hearing that gold prices had risen again and that yarn prices had not fallen, confidence unanimously turned bullish. Retailers again started to aggressively buy, and the market trend went straight up, closing at 230,000 yuan at noon. It still showed a squeeze.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Credit Gradually Becomes Stable; Transfer Certificate Rises Ten Yuan <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Credit in the market is gradually becoming stable. The Central Bank was occupied by Northeast soldiers and civilians, and all business was at a standstill. The sell-off of goods was slightly hindered. However, off-market positions were mostly covered short, and dealers also supplied more funds, making turnover more flexible than before. Market interbank lending rates were between 50 yuan and 60 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Cash chips were quite popular because withdrawals within the industry were not possible, but there was rarely any premium.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange transfer certificate opened firm, with bids at 850 yuan and offers at 900 yuan.

At the noon market, designated commercial banks bid at 860 yuan and offered at 890 yuan, up ten yuan from yesterday.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics Decline</p>
<p>The prices of woolen fabrics mostly went from high to low yesterday. There were more sellers than buyers in the wholesale market and at tea parties. Most of the Hongxiang Zhanghua Yinfeng Shanghai woolen fabrics were quoted at 6,350 yuan, while Yuanfeng Dacheng Xiexin quoted 7,000 yuan. 555 and Double Cat medium-thick serge were all quoted at 4,500-4,600 yuan per yard. Yihe 135 and Yonghe woolen fabrics were offered at 4,750 yuan. On average, the overall decline from the red plate's highest peak was about two tenths of a scale [fractional unit of measurement]. The main reasons for the decline were limited actual sales and high overnight interbank lending rates.</p>
