<h3>顏惠慶等一行抵靑島　今日繼續飛赴北平　通郵問題亦將研商解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬和平代表團代表顏惠慶，章士釗，江庸，及以私人資格前往之邵力子，李代總統私人代表黃啓漢等一行十九人，終於十三日晨十一時乘中央航空公司專機離京飛平，全國人士渴望之和平使者終於成行，若干人士對此均視作和平前途樂觀之象徵。十三日上海天氣晴和，代表團於隔夜接獲通知後，卽準備妥當，故十三日如期成行·記者並於十三日晚自中央航空公司獲悉，該專機已平安抵達青島，惟以該機之一輸胎破損之故，已不克當日飛平，並俟央航於十四日另送輸胎一隻換上，始能離靑飛平。計昨日乘機前往者，除五代表外，並有劉仲華之眷屬，及各代表之私人秘書，江庸之子媳等共十九人，原定十時起飛，旋以擕帶行李過重及載人過多，臨時減少，而延誤一時許。該機於龍華機塲起飛，行前，各代表於九時集顏惠慶氏寓邸，並於九時三刻陸續抵機塲，時機塲候機室中人頭攢動，羣相包圍和平代表，而氣候晴朗，尤使在塲人士喜形於色。抵機塲送行者有湘公展，程滄波，賀耀組，喻培厚，倪弼，陶百川等，潘氏與各代表握手時，頻頻祝以此行成功。顏氏曾稱：「我們此行，對促進和平已付出了最大的努力」。江氏於記者請其發表談話時則稱：「沒有話說，我只希望此行成功」。邵氏卻對外間所稱「敲門」任務有所異議。邵氏稱：敲門者是表示門尚未開，吾人之任務實際係「推門」。各代表在休息候機時間內，由甘介侯爲之接洽與部署，料理飛機起飛諸事，極爲忙碌，而顏氏及邵氏之夫人陪侍於一旁，直至專機升空，揮揚手巾後始離去。又代表團一行，期於一周後能完成任務返滬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕國共區通郵事，有關技術方面之問題尚待商洽，交通當局因此問題之重要，特乘滬和平代表團赴平之便，商請顏惠慶·江庸兩氏就便與共方商洽，俾早日獲致解決。</p>

<h3>官員乘搬遷貪汚監委正進行調查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府此次由京遷穗，因時日匆促，容有若干意外事件，如外傳某某等行政官員利用政府搬遷，而趁火打劫，貪污舞弊諸端。監察院蘇浙區監委行署有鑒及此，目前正進行調查，監委喻培厚對記者表示，吾人決不容此等腐敗份子利用機會，而貽害人民，如調查有據，自當依法執行監察權。</p>
<h3>平召開民衆大會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十三日廣播：今日中共方面在北平召開有政治宣傳性的民衆大會，以慶祝共軍之入城，自小學至大學之男女學生均會接通知參加遊行之列。遊行者抬李代總統像，像上書「假和平」字樣，化裝遊行中，有人裝扮「山姆叔叔」，蔣總統，蔣夫人，孔祥熙及宋子文等人物，頭項懸有「戰犯」牌子，遷行之列申尚有巨幅漫畫，有一幅上繪懸美國星條旗之國民黨船隻正在上海內下沉的畫面，參加行列中亦有工人份子，共軍在沿途維持秩序。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十三日電〕市長葉劍英昨在此間集會發表演說稱：「吾人必須逮捕戰犯與犯重大罪名之反動派領袖，中國眞正永久和平之惟一基礎爲中共主席毛澤東之八項條件，美帝國主義領導下之假和平力欲獲得喘息機會，以便捲土重來」。</p>
<h3>中共發表聲明抨擊外國調處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十三日廣播：陝北電台今日廣播中共發言人聲明，對聯合國調處中國問題之建議，加以抨擊·該聲明稱，「任何外國政府或聯合國，都絕對無權干涉中國內政，澳洲外長伊瓦特的建議是荒謬的，侮辱中國人民的。孫科和潘公展等的談話，不過表現其立塲」。中共聲明，「任何外國的千涉，都只能受到中國人民的堅決反對」。</p>

<h3>戴傳賢遺體大殮靈柩明運蓉安葬</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十三日電〕戴傳賢遺體定十四日晨九時在奧光製殮公司大殮，並將於十五日晨空運成都，送返原籍安葬，戴氏哲嗣戴安國，頃已趕抵廣州奔喪。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十三日電〕戴傳賢逝世後，記者爲明瞭眞相，特分向有關方面探詢實情，據戴氏哲嗣戴安國稱：戴先生逝世後，曾檢見其遺物，并無任何遺書遺囑，外間所傳，純屬虛構。至戴氏死因，記者曾目睹中山大學醫學院附屬醫院主任張夢石及主治醫師李士梅所出具之醫字第二九五號死亡證明書全文，爲：「戴傳賢先生年六十歲，患心臟衰弱症於民國卅八年二月十二日晨突然發作，至十時四十分死亡。特此證明」。至戴夫人經記者探悉，原與戴先生同寓東園，患病已久，且血壓常高逾二百餘度，戴先生病發時，其家人爲免戴夫人受刺激致影響其病體，故雖經醫師診斷，戴先生巳無法救治，亦未告知戴夫人，并卽微得其同意，由劉紀文夫人沈鵬飛夫人及戴先生老友杜醫師之女公子三人陪同其往中央醫院留醫，刻尚寓中央醫院二〇六號房，足見外傳種種之絕非事實。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕國史館館長戴傳賢氏，前日在穗逝世，中央研究院院畏朱家驊氏聞耗，極爲哀悼，除電戴夫人慰唁外，並決於日內自滬飛穗祭奠，并爲戴氏料理身後事宜。</p>
<h3>李代總統廣播改定明日發表　—內容為整肅官常及軍風紀—</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕李代總統將發表之廣播演說，其內容非外傳所謂重申政府與共黨謀取和平之決心，據接近李代總統之人士稱：代總統對顏惠慶，邵力子等一行業已赴平一事，顯甚重視，在接獲彼等之正式報告前，將不致就和平問題表示任何意見。李代總統之廣播詞正起草中，其內容爲整肅官常及整飭軍風紀，勗勉全國政府官員，軍官，士兵振刷精神，共度此艱難之時局。廣繙詞中僅略提及政府現正努力之和平運動，該項原稿十三日尚未核定，十四日已不及廣播，將改定十五日發表。</p>
<h3>矣行，「推六代表」　和使勝空記</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張明</p>
<p>全上海，乃至全國的人們所寄望的上海和平代表團，昨天（十三日）終於在晴明的天空下，登上銀翼北飛了。我們看他振翼翱翔，是輕鬆自如，但回顧機塲擁擠不堪的送行者，卻覺得他是責任重大此飛不易了。</p>
<p>代表們的啟程時間原定時十點鐘，但竟以許多事務上的小節延誤了一小時，代表們在機塲的身份，幾乎被視作天使，一重重的被人們包圍着，尤其是和平老人邵力子，他在被邀到樓上休息時，這一扇被他跨過去的門，立刻讓人加上了一張紙條，上面寫着「和平之門」。誰不渴望和平啊！</p>
<p>顯然的，代表們被一種熱切期望的空氣鼓動得相當的興奮，你看：上了年紀的老先生們，都應接不暇地和記者們談這說那，直到他們的監護者忠告着：「讓他休息休息吧」！方能暫時休憩下來。</p>
<p>今天在機塲上，中外各報的攝影記者，用各種角度，給代表們寫下各種實錄。邵老總是笑迷迷的，很耐性的讓大家攝個盡性。他們都以最大的愉快迎接這些熱情的流露。</p>
<p>有人說這幾位代表的籍貫正巧是分佈着東南西北，似乎恰好說明他們是代表着全國東南西北各個角落裏的人們的意見。顏老說：「今天，全世界每一個角落裏的人，都在希望和平而感到和平之可貴；中國人民，因爲受苦最深，所以渴望更切，我們代表團能夠在這種機會裏飛向故都，謀求和平，對全國人士的和平渴望，總是算已有了進步。但願此行能夠把共方對正式和談的時日問題的答案，及部份意見帶回來，就算圓滿了」。和平確是每個人所希望的，當專機升空而去的時候，許多人高呼：「終於是去了」。</p>
<p>和平代表的任務，邵老特地來了個正名的說明：他認爲「敲門使者」，實在是不妥當的，因爲敲門是用在門尚未開的時候，我們卻是去推開那個僅是虛掩着的門，我們希望的是和平之門大開啊！說得許多人都笑了。和平代表成爲推門代表了。</p>
<h3>南京人民和平代表團　任務完成昨解散　發表聲明否認報載在平接洽情形</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕人民和平代表團十三日正式宣告任務兀成，卽日解散，該代表團代表七人中之六人，爲連日報載該團在平情形與事實頗多出入，十三日下午集會商討更正辦法，參與者爲邱致中·鄧季雨·曾資生·宋國櫃·夏元芝·吳哲生。當決定：（一）發表聲明，對重要各點提出更正。（二）李代總統將於十四日或十五日邀見該團全體代表，邱等六人決定不去。（四）中國人民和平策進會決移上海，繼續策進和平，南京事務所卽日宣告撤銷。（四）中國人民策進會與中國各大學教授國策研究會合組之人民和平代表國任務完畢，宣告將該團解散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕赴平與中共人士接觸之人民和平代表團團員七人中之六人，十三日發表聲明，就連日中外各報所載該團在平洽談和平情形予以否認，謂所載內容中有事實不符，此事對該團及國共當局與南方人民之影響至深且鉅，故提出重要者六點，加以更正，該聲明係由邱致中·鄧季雨·曾資生·宋國樞·夏元芝·吳哲生六人簽名，其更正之六點爲：（一）十二日該團未參加總統府集會，亦不準備謁見政府任何當局。（二）中共對「戰犯」。「改編軍隊」兩項條件可以讓步說，無所聞。（三）中共當局業有具體條件交該團帶回說，尤無根據。（四）該團在靑島與北平中共接觸時，並非某代表以私人關係直接與葉劍英通話。（五）該團七代表中至少六人朱與聶榮臻。林彪晤面。（六）合衆社所傳共黨將在一個月內同意和國民黨舉行和談，葉劍英保證在和談前與和談期間不致攻繫長江防綫，中共認李代總統在和談中不足代表國民黨及不要求拘留或審判蔣總統等，不但純屬無稽，且屬跡近造謠。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕人民和平代表團代表夏元芝十三日談，此次赴平所獲印象，爲和平希望甚爲渺茫，但並非絕無希望，渠對連日各報所載該團某團員之談話與事實出入過鉅一事，表示遺憾。據稱彼等僅以人民立塲，向中共人士提出意見，中共人士允轉呈中共中央後，在廣播中答覆，中共並無任何具體條件交由該團帶來。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕人民和平代表團代表吳裕後，十三日晚談，代表團在平時曾與葉劍英會談兩次，渠本人因與葉劍英有私交，故又單獨談話兩次，所知者較共他團員爲多，渠以爲此種有利和平之消息，應使人民了解，故向記者透露。惟記者之記城亦頗有出入，如謂李代總統在和談</p>
<h3>南通以東各橋頭堡放棄　逸仙艦增防江陰　津浦路兩側共調動繁忙</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十三日電〕挪威外畏蘭琪自美乘飛機今晨抵此，向新聞記者稱，吾人不可操之過急。渠之此項聲明，係答覆前次之挪威擊明謂挪威對最近蘇聯照會之覆文，須待十六日渠返國前送交蘇聯。又稱，予目前對於局勢更有淸楚認識，吾人更應注意者厥爲事實。某記者表示渠此次赴美結果，促使大西洋公約之起草工作，發生一種危機。渠答稱，此僅爲瑞典方面之觀法，與事實不符。蘭琪將於明日會晤貝文，檢討有關挪威可能參加大西洋公約問題。渠將於十五晚或十六晨離英返國。</p>

<p>〔聯合社匈京十二日電〕匈外長賴克今日就明眞諦案向報界發表聲明，略謂，美英當局以維護宗教與人權自由之名，掩飾其千涉匈內政，其所用手段，絕難令人同意。此輩爲該案之法西斯被告辯護，殊不知其引用之和約，卽在制止法西斯主義。艾契遜欲以明眞諦案向聯合國申訴，吾人亦準備在該機構辯明是非曲直。</p>

<h3>美生考慮　遠東戰略防綫</h3>
<p>大部官司員主張放棄日本</p>
<p>〔台衆社華盛頓十三日電〕據此間的各種跡象，亞洲海岸外的島嶼防綫，在美國的軍事計劃中，似佔重要地位。合衆社所訪問的軍事分析家，雖對細則頗多歧見，但各項意見的要點則爲：在長時期中，共黨在中國的收獲，將引起美國必須在何處建立戰略防綫的問題。幾乎沒有一個人認爲來自亞洲的共黨的軍事力量，在以後數年中將成爲任何嚴重的攻擊威脅，但爲計及以後可能發生的事變以及準備，應付此項事變的必要性，「島嶼防綫」則殊屬重要。若干人稱：此項防綫應包括起自極北的佔領下的日太，而南至菲列賓的美國基地。但據東京方面的消息，則又有若干人仕主張在島嶼防綫中放棄日本。此間觀察家認爲：陸軍部否認東京消息的眞實性，顯示高級人仕對日本的戰略價值，具有不同的意見，如此係屬實，則上項否認可能卽係表示：華盛頓方面的制定政策者的多數意見，準備放棄日本，而認爲日本在美國的戰略上不佔重要。</p>

<h3>Yan Huiqing and His Party Arrive in Qingdao, Continuing to Fly to Beiping Today; Postal Issues Will Also Be Discussed and Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Shanghai Peace Delegation representatives Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, and Shao Lizi, who is traveling in a private capacity, along with Li Dai President's personal representative Huang Qihan, a group of nineteen people, finally departed Beijing on the morning of the 13th at 11:00 AM on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) special plane for Beiping. The peace envoys, longed for by the people of the entire nation, have finally set out. Some people view this as an optimistic sign for the future of peace. On the 13th, the weather in Shanghai was clear and pleasant. The delegation, after receiving notification the previous night, prepared themselves promptly. Therefore, they departed as scheduled on the 13th. This reporter also learned from CNAC on the evening of the 13th that the special plane had safely arrived in Qingdao. However, due to damage to one of the plane's tires, it was unable to fly to Beiping that day. CNAC will send another tire on the 14th to replace it before it can leave Qingdao for Beiping. Those who traveled by plane yesterday included the five representatives, family members of Liu Zhonghua, personal secretaries of each representative, and Jiang Yong's son and daughter-in-law, totaling nineteen people. The original departure time was set for 10:00 AM, but it was delayed by over an hour due to excessive luggage and too many passengers, which had to be reduced temporarily. The plane took off from Longhua Airport. Before departure, the representatives gathered at Yan Huqing's residence at 9:00 AM and arrived at the airport successively at 9:45 AM. At that time, the waiting room at the airport was crowded with people who surrounded the peace representatives. The clear weather made the people on the scene even happier. Those who came to the airport to see them off included Xiang Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, He Yaozu, Yu Peihou, Ni Bi, Tao Baichuan, etc. When Pan shook hands with the representatives, he repeatedly wished them success in their trip. Mr. Yan once said: "We have made the greatest efforts to promote peace on this trip." When the reporter asked Mr. Jiang to make a statement, he said: "I have nothing to say, I only hope that this trip will be successful." Mr. Shao, however, disagreed with the "knocking on the door" mission mentioned outside. Mr. Shao said: Knocking on the door means that the door is not yet open. Our task is actually to "push the door." During the waiting time, Gan Jihou negotiated and arranged matters for them, and was extremely busy taking care of the take-off of the plane. The wives of Mr. Yan and Mr. Shao accompanied them and did not leave until the special plane took off and they waved their handkerchiefs. In addition, the delegation expects to complete its mission and return to Shanghai in a week.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Regarding the issue of postal service between the KMT and CPC areas, the technical aspects still need to be negotiated. Due to the importance of this issue, the transportation authorities took advantage of the Shanghai Peace Delegation's trip to Beiping and requested Mr. Yan Huqing and Mr. Jiang Yong to discuss it with the Communist side at their convenience, so as to achieve a resolution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 13th] Huang Xuchu flew back to Guilin from Guangzhou yesterday.

<h3>Dai Chuanxian's Body Is Prepared for Burial; Coffin Will Be Transported to Chengdu Tomorrow for Burial</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th] After Dai Chuanxian's death, in order to clarify the truth, reporters made inquiries from relevant parties. According to Dai's son, Dai Anguo: After Mr. Dai's death, his belongings were inspected, and there were no wills or testaments. The rumors outside are purely fabricated. As for the cause of Dai's death, the reporter witnessed the full text of death certificate No. 295 issued by Zhang Mengshi, director of the Affiliated Hospital of the Medical College of Zhongshan University, and attending physician Li Shimei: "Mr. Dai Chuanxian, 60 years old, suffered from heart failure, which suddenly broke out on the morning of February 12, 38th year of the Republic of China, and died at 10:40 AM. This is to certify." As far as the reporter knows, Dai's wife originally lived in Dongyuan with Mr. Dai. She has been ill for a long time, and her blood pressure is often over 200 degrees. When Mr. Dai fell ill, in order to avoid stimulating Mrs. Dai and affecting her health, although the doctor diagnosed that Mr. Dai could not be saved, she was not informed. With her consent, Mrs. Liu Jiwen, Mrs. Shen Pengfei, and the daughter of Mr. Dai's old friend, Dr. Du, accompanied her to the Central Hospital for treatment. She is currently staying in Room 206 of the Central Hospital, which shows that all kinds of rumors are not true.</p>

<h3>Acting President Li's Broadcast Rescheduled for Tomorrow - Contents Include Rectifying Official Conduct and Military Discipline -</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The content of the broadcast speech to be delivered by Acting President Li is not, as rumored, a reiteration of the government's determination to seek peace with the Communist Party. According to people close to Acting President Li, the Acting President attaches great importance to the fact that Yan Huqing, Shao Lizi and others have already gone to Beiping. Before receiving their official report, he will not express any opinion on the peace issue. Acting President Li's broadcast speech is being drafted, and its content is to rectify official conduct and military discipline, and to encourage government officials, officers, and soldiers across the country to boost their spirits and overcome this difficult situation together. The broadcast speech only briefly mentions the peace movement that the government is currently working on. The original draft has not been approved on the 13th, and there is no time to broadcast it on the 14th. It will be rescheduled for the 15th.</p>
<h3>A Trip to "Push the Six Representatives": An Empty Record of Peace Envoys</h3>
<p>- Our Newspaper Reporter Zhang Ming</p>
<p>The Shanghai Peace Delegation, which the people of Shanghai and even the whole country were looking forward to, finally took off into the clear sky yesterday (the 13th). We saw it soar with ease, but looking back at the crowded send-off at the airport, we felt that it had a heavy responsibility and this flight was not easy.</p>
<p>The representatives' departure time was originally scheduled for 10:00 AM, but it was delayed by an hour due to many trivial matters. The representatives' status at the airport was almost regarded as angels, and they were surrounded by people in layers. Especially the peace elder Shao Lizi, when he was invited to rest upstairs, a piece of paper was immediately added to the door he had crossed, with the words "Gate of Peace" written on it. Who doesn't yearn for peace!</p>
<p>Obviously, the representatives were quite excited by a kind of eager expectation. You see, the elderly gentlemen were busy talking to reporters, until their guardians advised, "Let him rest for a while"! Only then could they rest temporarily.</p>
<p>Today at the airport, photographers from Chinese and foreign newspapers used various angles to record various real records of the representatives. Elder Shao always smiled and patiently allowed everyone to take pictures to their heart's content. They all greeted these enthusiastic expressions with the greatest pleasure.</p>
<p>Some people say that the native places of these representatives happen to be distributed in the east, south, west, and north, which seems to indicate that they represent the opinions of people in every corner of the east, south, west, and north of the country. Elder Yan said: "Today, people in every corner of the world are hoping for peace and feel that peace is precious. The Chinese people have suffered the most, so they yearn for it even more. Our delegation can fly to the old capital in this opportunity to seek peace. It can always be regarded as a progress in the national people's desire for peace. I hope this trip can bring back the answer to the question of the date of formal peace talks and some opinions from the Communist Party, which would be satisfactory." Peace is indeed what everyone hopes for. When the special plane took off, many people shouted: "It's finally gone."</p>
<p>Regarding the task of the peace representative, Elder Shao specially gave a clarification: He believes that "knocking on the door envoy" is really inappropriate, because knocking on the door is used when the door has not been opened, but we are going to push open the door that is only half-closed. What we hope is that the door of peace will be wide open! Many people laughed at that. The peace representative became a push-door representative.</p>
<h3>Nanjing People's Peace Delegation: Mission Completed, Disbanded Yesterday; Issues Statement Denying Reported Negotiations in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The People's Peace Delegation officially announced the completion of its mission on the 13th and disbanded on the same day. Six of the seven representatives of the delegation, due to the fact that the reports in the newspapers about the delegation's situation in Beiping were quite different from the facts, gathered on the afternoon of the 13th to discuss how to correct them. Those who participated were Qiu Zhizhong, Deng Jiyu, Zeng Zisheng, Song Guogui, Xia Yuanzhi, and Wu Zhesheng. It was decided: (1) To issue a statement to correct the important points. (2) Acting President Li will invite all the representatives of the delegation to meet on the 14th or 15th. Qiu and others decided not to go. (4) The China People's Peace Promotion Association decided to move to Shanghai and continue to promote peace. The Nanjing office announced its cancellation on the same day. (4) The People's Peace Delegation, jointly formed by the China People's Promotion Association and the National Policy Research Association of Professors from various universities in China, completed its mission and announced the dissolution of the delegation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Six of the seven members of the People's Peace Delegation who went to Beiping to contact the CPC members issued a statement on the 13th, denying the peace talks carried by the Chinese and foreign newspapers in the past few days, saying that there were facts that did not match the content carried. This matter has a profound impact on the delegation, the KMT and CPC authorities, and the people of the South. Therefore, six important points were put forward to correct them. The statement was signed by Qiu Zhizhong, Deng Jiyu, Zeng Zisheng, Song Guoshu, Xia Yuanzhi, and Wu Zhesheng. The six points of correction were: (1) The delegation did not participate in the presidential palace meeting on the 12th, nor did it plan to meet with any government authorities. (2) It was unheard of that the CPC could make concessions on the two conditions of "war criminals" and "reorganizing the army." (3) It was especially groundless to say that the CPC authorities had specific conditions to be brought back by the delegation. (4) When the delegation contacted the CPC in Qingdao and Beiping, it was not a certain representative who directly spoke to Ye Jianying through private relations. (5) At least six of the seven representatives of the delegation did not meet with Nie Rongzhen and Lin Biao. (6) The United Press reported that the Communist Party would agree to hold peace talks with the Kuomintang within a month, and Ye Jianying guaranteed that the Yangtze River defense line would not be attacked before and during the peace talks. The CPC believes that Acting President Li is insufficient to represent the Kuomintang and does not demand the detention or trial of President Chiang, etc., which is not only purely unfounded, but also approaches rumor-mongering.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Xia Yuanzhi, a representative of the People's Peace Delegation, said on the 13th that the impression gained from this trip to Beiping was that the hope for peace was very slim, but not without hope. He expressed regret over the fact that the talks of a certain member of the delegation, as reported in various newspapers in the past few days, were too different from the facts. It is said that they only put forward opinions to the CPC members from the people's standpoint. The CPC members agreed to forward them to the CPC Central Committee and reply in the broadcast. The CPC did not have any specific conditions to be brought back by the delegation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Wu Yuhou, a representative of the People's Peace Delegation, said on the evening of the 13th that the delegation had two talks with Ye Jianying in Beiping. Because he had a personal relationship with Ye Jianying, he also had two separate talks. He knew more than the other members of the delegation. He believed that this kind of news that was beneficial to peace should be understood by the people, so he revealed it to reporters. However, the reporter's record was also quite different, such as saying that Acting President Li was participating in the peace talks.</p>

Due to excessive speed, upon arriving at the location, the car violently collided with a rickshaw (number 13055) carrying a child named Wang Dalin (15 years old). The child was thrown from the vehicle and crushed by the car's wheels, resulting in broken ribs and severe abdominal injuries. The rickshaw was severely damaged. Ms. Ross, realizing she had caused a major accident, quickly turned the steering wheel and attempted to flee eastward. At that moment, Officer Chen Qian of the Yangshupu Road Police Station, along with Patrolman Chen Maozhu, were patrolling and immediately gave chase, but were too late to stop her. They witnessed the car speeding away. Officer Chen then contacted the Yulin Road Precinct from a nearby police booth, notifying them to assist in apprehending the car. The car fled to the front of the Da Zhonghua Restaurant at No. 1873 Songpan Road on the same road, where it again ran rampant, violently hitting a pedestrian, Gao Buyun (30 years old, a barber residing at Zhoujia Pailou), who was crushed and killed instantly.

At this point, Ross became increasingly panicked and, regardless of everything, sped forward. At No. 1761 on the same road, she crushed two rickshaws parked on the side of the road, numbers 8472 and 1997. Continuing forward, at No. 1757, she crashed into a power pole.

The injured were transported to the Hudong Fangji and Erfang Hospitals. Ross was bandaged up at the Hudong Hospital by a doctor and then requested to be transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital at No. 2 Beijing Road for treatment. The body of the man who was crushed to death was later transported by hearse to the Changde Road morgue, awaiting inspection by the District Prosecutor's Office.</p>

<p>Export Trade Center Will Shift from Shanghai to Guangzhou</p>
<p>Many Exporters Go to Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Inspect</p>
<p>According to the import and export industry, recently, due to the difficulty of navigation on the Yangtze River, the transportation of native products from Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui to Shanghai has been inconvenient, resulting in a significant blow to export trade. Last year, Shanghai's export trade reached US$175,823,513.65, accounting for more than 70% of the country's total exports, with bristles ranking first, estimated at approximately US$31 million, followed by tung oil, estimated at approximately US$29 million. Other materials include fur, vegetable oil, tea, and cotton textiles. Currently, due to transportation issues on the Yangtze River, there is a shortage of goods arriving. Export sales rely entirely on Shanghai's inventory, so there has been a significant decrease compared to the same period last year. It is reported that the industry is now planning to transport the above-mentioned export materials through Guangzhou. Many industry giants have recently left Shanghai to inspect the Guangdong-Hankou Railway area. If this plan is realized, the center of export trade will shift to Guangzhou.</p>

<p>Jin Jiao Spring Cold</p>
<p>Special Correspondent for This Newspaper Ling Songsou</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 10th] Under the current developments, whether it is peace or war, this fertile region of Southern Jiangsu is the "problem". If it is peace, how should Southern Jiangsu seek stability at the moment? If it is war, how should Southern Jiangsu prepare for "contingency"? The county councils of Southern Jiangsu are now appealing to the government to declare Jiangnan as a "non-defensive zone." However, the communist army in the three mountainous areas (Tianmu Mountain, Huangshan Mountain, West Mountain) on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces has already established the "Political Work Steering Committee of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Region" to deploy and guide all activities of the communist army in this area. Chairman Ding Zhipan said, "Because of the other party's compactness and our laxity, more than 2,000 people can be used as 20 million people. The Communist Party's political legs have already crossed over to Jiangnan!" He wants to strengthen the organization and training of the people in Southern Jiangsu for this purpose, but he encountered opposition from local gentry in Wuxi. He wants to strengthen the efficiency of basic-level administrative work and refresh the atmosphere of basic-level administrative work. He intends to recruit 5,000 young people from a large number of refugee students to engage in local basic-level administrative work, but only more than 500 people have registered after two months. Some Jiangsu Provincial Senators in Shanghai are dissatisfied with Chairman Ding's administration. However, this kind of disconnection between the government and the people still exists today, and it is not just Ding Zhipan's distress.</p>
<p>It snowed in Zhenjiang today, and the three mountains were covered in silver, seeming even more beautiful. Jiao Mountain in the river has difficult ship traffic due to the martial law on the river. Jinshan suffered a major fire last year, and there is no longer anything to celebrate. Although spring is just beginning to descend upon humanity, seeing the loneliness of Jinjiao and facing the snow-covered mountains really makes people feel extra cold.</p>
<p>Changzhou Machine Industry Stalls, More Than 30 Factories Do Not Open</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin 12th] There are more than 30 machine industries in this county, Wansheng and Housheng. The number ranks second in Jiangsu Province. Last winter, the situation was tense, the economy was unstable, and the industry fell into a slump. Agricultural machinery had no sales at all, and factories had no orders for machine production. Factories were on the verge of collapse. After the Spring Festival, only three or so were able to continue operating. More than 30 factories are in a dilemma and have no power to start work. Workers' lives are in extreme panic. Last year, the government advocated for industrial loans, and factories in this county applied for loans, with various complications, but there has been no news to date. Domestic national banks have never been interested in lending to this industry, causing it to become a fish stuck in a dry rut. The industry has now made an urgent appeal to the society and the government about the crisis, in order to arouse attention.</p>

<h3>Hungary Condemns US Interference in Internal Affairs; US Recalls Envoy; Plans to Appeal to the UN Regarding the Mindszenty Case</h3>
<p>[United Press, Budapest, 12th] The Hungarian Foreign Ministry announced tonight that the Hungarian government has requested the United States to recall Ambassador Chapin and Deputy Military Attaché Cooper Sack. It is claimed that the recall of the US ambassador is related to the treason case of Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Budapest, 12th] Hungarian Foreign Minister Rajk issued a statement to the press today on the Mindszenty case, saying that the US and British authorities, in the name of safeguarding religious and human rights, are concealing their interference in Hungary's internal affairs, and the means they use are difficult to agree with. These people defend the fascist defendants in the case, unaware that the treaty they cite is precisely to stop fascism. If Acheson wants to appeal to the United Nations regarding the Mindszenty case, we are also prepared to clarify the truth in that organization.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The State Department has telegraphed Chapin to return home "for consultations" and informed Hungary that the United States resolutely rejects the demand to execute Chapin. This mutual notification is the most serious of tensions between the United States and Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe. The only worse step besides war would be breaking off diplomatic relations with Hungary. It is reported that the United States is currently considering: (1) condemning Hungary's actions in the Mindszenty case in the United Nations and condemning its violation of treaties; (2) protesting Hungary's trial and sentencing of Mindszenty and the charges against Chapin; (3) demanding that Hungary close its consulates in New York and Cleveland.</p>
<h3>US Considers a Far East Strategic Defense Line</h3>
<p>Most Officials Advocate Abandoning Japan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] According to various indications here, the island defense line off the coast of Asia seems to occupy an important position in the US military plan. Although the military analysts interviewed by the United Press have many differences on the details, the main points of the various opinions are: in the long term, the gains of the Communists in China will cause the United States to consider where to establish a strategic defense line. Almost no one believes that the military force of the Communists from Asia will become any serious offensive threat in the next few years, but in order to account for possible future events and prepare for the necessity of dealing with such events, the "island defense line" is particularly important. Some people say that this defense line should include Japan under occupation from the far north to the American bases in the Philippines in the south. However, according to news from Tokyo, some people advocate abandoning Japan in the island defense line. Observers here believe that the Army Department's denial of the authenticity of the Tokyo news shows that senior officials have different opinions on the strategic value of Japan. If this is the case, the above denial may indicate that the majority opinion of policymakers in Washington is prepared to abandon Japan and believe that Japan does not occupy an important position in the US strategy.</p>
<h3>Allied Officials Announce No Change in Policy Toward Japan</h3>
<p>Moscow Radio Criticizes Eichelberger</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] Kyodo News Agency of Japan published on the 13th that a senior official of the Allied Headquarters has clarified the Japanese people's concerns that the United States will abandon Japan in the event of war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The official said: "The occupation policy has not changed." The agency did not reveal the official's name, but excerpted his remarks, saying: "The Japanese people can be sure that any actions of the United States will not sacrifice them." The agency also specifically notified its Japanese newspaper subscribers that the news has been approved for release by the Allied Headquarters.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] Moscow Radio on the 13th criticized US Lieutenant General Eichelberger (former commander of the Eighth Army stationed in Japan) for demanding increased weapons for Japanese police.</p>
<h3>US Concerned About Australian Defense</h3>
<p>[United Press, Sydney, 12th] The Sunday Telegraph stated on the 12th that the United States is very concerned about the lack of defense in Australia. The newspaper quoted authoritative sources as saying that Washington has requested the US Army, Navy, and Air Force in Australia to report the details of Australia's defense preparations. It is claimed that one reason the United States is considering Australia's defense capabilities is the success of the Communists in China.</p>

<h3>UN Commission on Korea Urges North-South Reconciliation; Willing to Contact North Korean Regime</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 12th] Australian representative Shaw, chairman of the UN agency in Korea, said at a welcome meeting in Seoul Stadium today, urging Koreans not to increase tensions between the North and South during the commission's investigation. The meeting was attended by 40,000 people. Prior to that, the police uncovered a Communist plot to blow up the main stand of the stadium. Shaw also said that the purpose of the commission's trip was to open the iron curtain blocking the North and South of Korea.

Chinese representative Liu Yu-wan said that if the North and South of Korea are not unified as soon as possible, its newly gained independence may not last long.

Philippine representative Rona said that North Korea can send representatives to participate in the Seoul government at any time.</p>
