<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方十日上午十時消息：（一）日來我小部隊不斷出擊，戰果輝煌，士氣極旺，各地民眾紛紛慰勞與協助，軍民均抱有必勝信心。（二）九日午我軍一部向崑山以西鐵路公路交久叉處出擊，斃匪二百餘。（三）九日匪千餘，向太倉東新木橋進犯，激戰一小時，斃匪二百餘，匪不支潰退。</p>

<p>〔中央社漢口十日電〕「醞釀已久之武漢保衛戰，於昨晨在漢口以北卅公里之兩路口正式揭幕，共匪林彪部約六百人，與守軍發生遭遇戰，激戰一小時後，斃匪百餘，近午後匪復增援千餘人，戰門移至橫山李家崗之綫，迄晚仍在激戰中。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口十日電〕十日為武漢保衛戰之第二日，午前一時，林彪部匪千餘人，乘深夜家庭視綫不清，向我漢口外圍豐河山陣地攻擊，并以一部向李家崗·蒲團廟佯擊，企圖將我豐河山包圍，另以一部由黃花澇乘民船八艘，偷渡大李家墩，被我守軍發覺，當擊沉三艘，魯道源司令官據報，乃令守軍以一部向豐河山兩側迂廻逆製，戰門至拂曉，匪遂感不支，乃向許家廟·黃家畈·黃花澇等地逃竄。正午十二時，復以一部偷渡陳家磯以北之三道僑，我軍立即前往掃蕩，迄晚十時，仍在灄口許家廟一帶與我軍對峙中。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口十日電〕邇來武漢無稽謠言迭出，頗足動搖人心，記者為明悉武漢附近軍事情況，特走訪華中軍政長官公署負責人員，叩詢真相。承告，平漢正面之匪軍，近日逐漸南下，我第三兵團所部南移武漢，純屬完成戰略部署，武漢城防工事已經完成，且甚堅強，而華中整個戰略鞏固，匪如進犯，必予相當打擊。至疏散居民，及非戰門人員，軍用輜重物資，旨在減少因戰爭所受不必要損失。又目前長江自漢口以上水運，與粵漢路仍暢通，漢口至九江亦暢行無阻，外傳水陸交通受阻一節，全屬無稽。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十日電〕武漢戰時空氣益形濃厚，警備部規定自十日晚起將戒嚴間提早二小時，即自晚十時起至翌晨六時止。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕本市各界保衛大上海反共宣傳週，昨為第二日，本市廣播界人士為響應宣傳起見，昨日全日假上海電臺舉行擴大廣播宣傳，特請市長陳良，市黨部主委方治，京滬杭警備總部政務委會常委谷正綱，及陳司令代表張泰祥曁談益民等發表廣播。</p>
<p>谷正綱廣播</p>
<p>要求上海同胞做到五事</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕京滬杭警備總部政務委員會常委谷正綱氏，昨應本市各界反共救國宣傳週之請，特發表廣播，原文如下：</p>
<p>上海同胞們：</p>
<p>共產黨狡詐猙獰的面目，已經暴露無餘了，共產黨的武力侵略，已經擴大到上海了。我們要保護上海同胞的生命財產，我們要爭取上海同胞的生活自由，我們要保持整個國家民族的獨立生存，而挽救亡國滅種的刼運，應該一致奮起，集中力量，整齊步伐，給牠一個迎頭痛擊，來保衛我們的大上海，來爭取反共戰爭的最後勝利。</p>
<p>我們知道，共產黨是第三國際的第五縱隊，牠沒有國家的立場，沒有民族的觀念的。毛澤東在今年四月四日反對北大西洋公約宣言中，公然主張在第三次世界大戰中，牠要擁護蘇聯，并肩作戰，牠還把中華民國號改為中華人民共和國，又用鐮刀斧頭的旗幟來作我們的國旗。大家想想，這不是要把中國成為蘇聯的附庸嗎？如果共產黨奪得了政權，中國必遭亡國的命運，而四萬五千萬的同胞，便要做亡國的奴隸。</p>
<p>我們知道，共產黨是暴力的集團，牠披上了一層民主自由的糖衣，而隱藏着暴力專制的毒藥。在共產佔領區域，清算門爭的殘酷事實，令人談虎色變，就是在北平，在天津，牠們標榜城市政策，以民主自由來號召的地區，其剝奪人民的自由，壓迫人民的種種行為，使人民的生活自由喪失盡凈。因此，在牠們暴力專制之下，人民的生命同產，是絕對沒有保障的，人民的自由，是被剝奪盡凈的。如果共產黨奪陽了政權，大家想想，在這種暴力壓迫情形之下，還能生存嗎？我中華人民，不就要遭到悲慘的奴役生活嗎？</p>
<p>亡國奴役的慘禍，要降臨我們的頭上，我們決不能坐視，我們要起來自救救國，揭破共產黨替第三國際侵略中國的陰謀，認清這次戰爭絕對不是內戰，一致振奮，參加反侵略的民族戰爭，參加反極權的民主戰爭，參加保衛國家民族獨立生存的神聖戰爭。</p>
<p>上海同胞們！我們要認識這次戰爭的意義，我們要認清今日的大上海保衛戰，是挽救亡國媽役的前衛戰爭，爭取大上海保衛戰的勝利，使這一個偉大的國際都市，不致遭受共匪暴虐的摧殘，使全市五百萬自由市民，不致陷入黑暗的鐵幕，更保衛了國家民族的獨立生存，不致遭到亡國媽役的慘禍，其意義是何等的做大！因此，我要求上海的同胞，在這次戰爭中，要做到下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，要堅定必勝信念：共產黨做了第三國際的第五縱隊，要滅亡我國家，奴役我人民，比秦檜還要毒辣，比漢奸還要無恥，牠還反了中國的民族精神，違反了中國四萬萬五千萬人民的意志，猖獗只是一時，終必歸於失敗。我們反侵略，反極權，為國家民族爭獨立自由生存的戰爭，將與世界上民主自由的聯合陣綫，共同消滅國際的暴力集團，理值氣壯，終必勝利。</p>
<p>第二，要齊一作戰步伐：對於本市戰時一切措施，要共同擁護，一體實行，庶幾我五百萬市民的心，擬結而為一心，我五百萬市民的力量，團結而為整個的力量。這樣一個堅強的戰門體，自然無不勝了。</p>
<p>第三，要不投機，不妥協：我們要提高革命的警覺，發揮革命的精神，掃除失敗主義的心理，對於投機份子，妥協份子，間諜份子，應該嚴密監視，澈底肅清。我們從以往的教訓中，認為局部和平就是投降，中途妥協就是滅亡，帮助共匪就是漢奸。</p>
<p>第四，要有錢出錢，有力出力：上海有無限的資產，有廣大的人力，這正是我們剿滅共匪的資本，這正是我們爭取勝利的武器。我以前曾和上海同胞說過，要破產才能保產，要拼命才能保命，現在是時候了，有錢的拿出錢來，有力的拿出力來，切不要讓共匪來清算我們的財產，殘殺我們的生命。</p>
<p>第五，要慰勞將士，救護傷兵：最後要向諸位同胞說的，我們對於大上海的保衛，已經有堅強的決心，和充分的準備，前方無數英勇的戰士，聯成了一條不可抗禦的堡壘，預備對來犯的敵人以嚴重的打擊，希望我上海的同胞，對這些正在作戰的英雄，多多慰勞，對於受傷的，迅施救護，以鼓勵士氣，迎接勝利。</p>
<p>上海同胞們！不顧受共匪摧殘，不顧做共產國際的奴隸牛馬的同胞們！我們要起來，我們要不分男女老幼，職業階級，一齊起來，以六百萬人的力量，築成一座鐵的長城，保衛大上海。我們要以上海作為敵人的墳墓，我們相信上海就是反攻的基地，上海的戰爭，就是我們勝利的開端。</p>
<p>陳良廣播辭</p>
<p>忍耐苦難必能自救救國</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕陳市長昨下午七時在上海電臺廣播，原文如下：因為和平的決裂，戰火已迫近我們大上海的市郊，保衛大上海的責任，已經加到我們全體市民的肩子上。我們為什麼要戡亂反共？因為我們的中華民國，是遵奉國價金孫先生的三民主義建立起來，共產黨雖然聲聲口口表示尊重三民主義，但實際上適得其反，如民族方面，他們只有國際路綫，絕無國家民族觀念，民權方面，他們只有一黨專政，甚至極少數人專制，絕無民主可言：民生方面，他們對於人民的衣食住行，更絕對不許自由，所以保衛大上海，不但是政府和軍隊的責任，更是全上海市民本身的利害和生死關頭。軍事方面，湯總司令已有萬全布置，四郊工事，已使本市完全堡壘化，市民儘可放心。但軍事的進行，有待於政治經濟的配合，前方的士氣，有賴於後方民心的鼓勵，所以我們在此大難臨頭的時候，一方面固要鎮定，沉着應變，同時尤須本「一心一德」，「同舟共濟」，「有力出力，有錢出錢」「破產保產，拼命保命」的決心，「放開眼光」，「加長視綫」，「犧牲小我」，「保全大我」。上漲係全國精華所在，擁有大量人力和物資，祇要我們能够齊心協力，向同一目標前進，忍耐目前的苦難，必能達到自救救國的目的。大戰時，蘇聯本土已大部淪陷，德軍長驅真入，勢如破竹，經史太林格勒一戰，蘇聯市民奮不顧身，參加作戰，卒能扭轉乾坤，達成最後勝利。以彼例此，上海戰事可絕對樂觀。本人職責，在「為市民服務」，對於市區秩序的維持，以及市民生活安定，是目前整個市府的重心，本人願與全市六百萬市民同甘苦，共患難，以完成保衛大上海的任務。</p>
<p>方治廣播辭</p>
<p>一切為前綫一切為士兵</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕市黨部主委方治，在保衛大上海反共宣傳週中播詞，略謂：「今天是本市舉行反共宣傳週之第二日，全市同胞們，必須要知道我們之所以反共，是因為共匪出賣國家，甘心作赤色帝國主義者的走狗，它已不是中國人，而是十足的漢奸。我們為什麼要剿匪，因為共匪不但出賣國家民族，而且強迫人民，奴役人民云當砲灰，今天搶刦一個地方，明天燒殺一個地方，今天門爭，明天清算，弄得夫妻兒女家家不能團聚一起，弄得人民不能過生活，因此我們不能不剿匪。我們中國過去卻不願亡於日本，現在自當不願亡於共產國際，所以為了救國家，我們即欲剿匪。其次，今天我們看共匪控制下的人民生活，是如何的慘痛與黑暗，我們將自己比他人，就應起來救救同是中國的人民，以達到救國救民的目的。</p>
<p>我們既然明瞭了反共剿匪的道理，就要說到上海市民應如何的起來幹，因為我們要救自己，必先救人家，并更進一步救國家。保衛大上海，即所以保衛全中國，因上海是全國最大的都市，和經濟命脈所在。我們不要以為南京·蘇州·鎮江·杭州被共匪佔領了，就恐懼担憂，要嘵得我們只要能保衛上海，共匪就被我們反包圍在裏面。談到保衛上海，我并不是說個個老百姓都要去拼命，現在前綫拼命的，有的是幾十萬武裝弟兄，他們即為我們拼命，我們當然應該尊敬他們，上海人民，到今天還能過生活，完全是靠了這些武裝弟兄在前綫浴血拼戰，因此我在這裏，必須要向全市的同胞們呼籲，有錢者出錢，有力者出力，大家來帮助武裝弟兄們。要知道，他們現在吃的，穿的，住的，用的，都不及我們，都過着最艱苦的生活，我們必須要將好吃的東西送給他們吃，好用的東西送給他們用，好穿的東西送給他們穿，可娛樂的東西送給他們享受，即所謂「一切為前綫」，「一切為士兵」，要這樣，那才是真正軍民合作，才對得起這些民族英雄</p>
<p>全市同胞們，現在是我們上海市民最後的生死關頭，我們必須要表顯出我們最大的人格，以過去「一二八」「八一三」的偉大革命精神，發揮出來，消滅共匪，救國家，救自己</p>
<h3 id="c10">立院秘密會議中　何院長報告當前大局　政府決作戰到底　並詳述和談破裂之經過 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十日電〕行政院長應欽十日上午十時在立法院第三會期十八次會秘密　會議中，就當前政治·經濟·軍事·外交·各方面情形提出報告，要點如次：</p>
<p>主席諸位委員先生：</p>
<p>貴院第三會期在革命策源地的廣州繼續開會，不禁使我們緬懷着國父當年在廣州領導革命的情況，當時國父領導革命的根據地，僅是廣東廣西兩省，但經過無數先烈的犧牲與奮門，終於剷除了腐惡的勢力，且進而統一全國達到初期革命成功的目的，現在共黨破壞和談，大舉南犯，我們在此集會，心情雖是非常的沉重，然而一想到國父的偉大與無數仁人志士悲壯的往事，我們的精神仍是極度的興奮與發揚。</p>
<p>應欽出任行政院長之初，即秉承李代總統曁政府即定的政策，以最大的誠意與容忍謀取和平，但是由於共黨的一意孤行，無理壓迫終使和談歸於失敗，且已轉入了戰門的新階段，現在我們為確保國家民族的生存，固有道德文化的持續，以及每一國民生活自由方式的維繋，惟有動員一切的力量與共黨作殊死的門爭，應欽綜理院務兼掌國防，在職一日，自當竭盡忠貞悉力以赴。</p>
<p>日昨接貴院通知，囑來此報告過去和談失敗的經過及今後關於外交軍事經濟等各項對策，茲謹分別　簡單報告如次：</p>
<p>和談破裂之經過及其責任</p>
<p>關於政府與共產黨間和平談判破裂之經過，四月二十日下午時應欽曾在南京向貴院作口頭報告，現在一再贅述詳情，僅摘要補述數語：</p>
<p>四月十六日黃代表紹竑自北平飛抵南京，携地來了共黨所謂「國內和平協定」最後修正案，內分八條廿四款，限政府代表於廿日以前簽字，所列條款報紙均已登載，茲不重述，看該項協定內容，共黨那裏是在談和，而完全是在招降，其條件之苛刻，比日本對同盟國之降書還要厲害千百倍，這充分劉明共黨對和平根本沒有絲毫誠意。政府接到共黨此項逼降之「哀的美敦書」，經李代總統立法監察兩院院長與在京中央各軍政首長及應欽連日會商結果，認為共黨所提「協定」之基本精神，及其條款與忠于貴院三月一日通過之和平問題意見書所列原則，及應欽於三月卅日向貴院所報告之行政院施政方針中所示和談所標舉之原則，「建立國家的和平統一，在公平合理的原則下，努力與中共進行全面和平商談」均完全相反，乃決定電告政府和談代表團轉達共黨，聲明不能接受此違背人民利益之逼降條件，原電中有「希望中共方面確認人民利益高於一切之原則，對此項協定之基本精神與內容，重新予以考慮」等語，且謂「為培育祥和空氣，極盼能即日成立臨時停戰協定，藉以表示雙方謀取真正和平之決心與誠意」，此項決策及致政府和談代表原電，曾於四月廿日下午四時報告忠于貴院，獲到貴院同意，并於當日下午十一時以前，將電文拍到北平，送達共黨。</p>
<p>自本年元旦蔣總統發表倡導和平之文告以來，共軍從朱停止進攻，四月一日政府和談代表團抵平以後，各綫共軍之攻勢更加猛烈，共黨定四月二十日為其發後通牒的限期，但當日共軍即從荻港方面渡江，廿一日中午毛澤東，朱德下令對國軍全面總攻遂使各談破裂，所以應欽要特向貴院鄭重聲明，和談破裂係由於共黨毫無誠意，并下令總攻，大舉渡江，所以共學和談破裂應負完全責任。</p>
<p>自毛澤東朱德於廿一日令共軍渡江總攻後，李代總統與本人即於廿二日致電我政府和談代表團，決定即日派機赴北平接代表團南京，廿三日上午九時專機自京起飛赴平，因航空公司接北平該公司來電謂：機場待修，不能降落，遂臨時以無綫電將專機召回，廿四日本人再由上海派機赴平，并携有本人致張首席代表治中曁各代表函請各代表即日乘專機逕返上海。廿五日專機返滬，携來張代表等五人之回信，始知我代表團被共方扣留，不讓南歸，廿七日行政院在廣州舉行院會，決議將政府和平商談代表團撤銷，并將張代表等來報紙發表，張代表治中原任西北軍政長官旣被扣留，不能回返任所，執行職務，而西北軍政大計，關係重要，不可無人主持，因於五月四日由行政院院會決議將其免職，派副長官寄　代理。</p>
<p>當前軍事經濟外情交勢</p>
<p>何院長繼報告和談破裂後政府留京機關遷穗之緊急措施，及共軍渡江後我方之各種情況。何氏曾闡述當前軍事經濟及外交情勢，關於經濟方面何氏聲明政府正努力：（一）力求穩定金融，使物價逐漸安定。（二）解決各地鈔荒。（三）改善公教人員待遇。（四）改善出口結匯辦法，何院長於其報告作結論稱，應欽此次受命於危難之際，出任行政院長，在就職之始，原期以最大之誠意與容忍，本公平合理的原則與共黨進行和談，以實現國家的和平與統一，解除人民倒懸的痛苦，乃以共黨毫無誠意，始終欲以武力征服整個祖國，為異族做侵略的先鋒，所以悍然以迫降條件結束和談，同時大舉渡江，擴大戰禍，應欽痛感　事與願違，不勝慚疚，現幸李代總統已於前日蒞臨政府所在地之廣州，貴院曁監察院亦均已在穗集會，對於救亡圖存之大計，必有賢明之決策。各行政主管機關遵循有自，當可減少過失，共赴事功。我們今天決為國家的獨立，領土主權的完整及人民生活的自由方式與中國共產黨作戰到底，只要我們能辦到「一德一心，群策群力」八個字，并且求改革，求進步，不動搖，不屈服，中央與地方融成一片」，人民與政府合為一體，最後的勝利必定是我們的，我從前說過：「深信最後的勝利必屬於愛國者，而不屬於賣國者，必屬於民主自由主義者，而不屬於暴力獨裁主義者」，現在依然以這幾句話作為今天報告的結論，敬請各位先生指教。</p>

<p>四強對於柏林問題已商獲協議，外長會議將於月內在巴黎舉行，僵持已久的德國問題顯已獲得了轉機，簽訂對德和約的日期似乎就在眼前了；但是對日問題呢？能不能在這次外長會議中獲得轉機？已為亞洲有關各國最關切的問題。據聯合社華府六日電稱：「西方國家的外交家對於未來的四國外長會議，將為早日締結對日和約覓獲一轉機。他們都認為蘇聯對於歐亞兩洲的永久和平，均處於舉足重輕的地位，蘇聯在巴黎外長會議中所締成了。」聯合社外交記者的這個報道，是一個非常近情的推測，柏林問題的解決，不僅是打開德國佤的轉機，而且也是世界和平的一大轉捩點：換言之：美蘇對於德國問題旣能妥協，對於日本問題自然也願其早日解決的。</p>
<p>誰都不能否認，美國以盟總的名義單獨管制戰敗的日本，四年來毫無成就，而其所付的代價卻非常驚人，使美國人民大有不勝負担之感。今年二月間在東京的美國軍事戰略家，曾一度盛倡「放棄日本，撤退佔領軍」的論調，他們一致認為日本是不可保衛的，而且也不是不值得保衛的；如果在未來大戰中美軍仍駐留日本，則美國必須負担以糧食接濟日本八千萬人民的義務，似覺得不償失。這種論調，雖屬美國在遠東的軍略計劃，但美國管制日本的失敗，是顯而易的。再以盟總對於日本的態度而論，也遠不及過去那末熱心的了。記得在扶日論高唱入雲的時候，麥帥對於日本的任何要求，無不樂於允諾，尤其在經濟上扶助日本，不遺餘力；但至今年三四月間，麥帥忽然也要日本自力更生，并指示一個「經濟九原則」，要吉田內閣切實遵行。五月二日麥帥發表文告，亦謂「盟國在波茨坦會議所揭　之目的，其要點多木完成，惟盟軍所以至今未撤，并非日本之過，而係日本無力控制外界情勢所致。今後盟軍佔領已由嚴厲的軍事管制，變為保護勢力的友誼指導。」</p>
<p>麥帥的文告，無異是一篇承認管制日本失敗的供狀，論理，美國早就應該設法與蘇聯謀得妥協，但是一種傳統的錯誤觀念，依然支配着美國朝野的心理，明知管制日本得不償失，但卻不願輕言放棄。所以麥帥於本月六日又向遠東委員會提出三項建議：（一）授予日本若干國際關係權，使其得以參加國際社會，恢復對外貿易，有助其經濟復興及早日撤退佔領軍。（二）加緊實行土地改革，以改善佃農的經濟情況。（三）放寬對日本外交政策及貿易政策所加的管制，使其得以參加任何國際會議。我們姑不問麥帥的動機何在？但在對日和約尚未簽訂之前，即允許日本參加國際社會，終是一種違背波茨坦宣言的不智之舉，無怪英·法·菲三國代表也要表示反對了，如果美國將此問題提交遠東委員會計論，我們相信，中蘇代表決不會同意此議的。</p>
<p>我們檢討美國四年來的對日本政策，可謂一誤再誤，陷於錯誤的泥沼裏，不能自拔。扶助日本的最終結果而言，也是有害無益的。這種誤人害憶的政策，早就該改弦易轍；可是美國外交當局依然執迷不悟，仍在那裏千方百計，抬高日本軍地位，企圖在未來的國際會議中獲一幫手；但在旁觀的我們看來，美國在日本的一切作為，無異在那裏安埋地雷，將來一旦爆炸，終必導成遠東的浩刧。所以，我們竭誠希望美國外交當局，能把握住柏林問題解決所給予世界和平的轉機，謀取對日問題的轉機，藉以打開相持已久的日本僵局。目前，正是美國朝野重行考慮其對日政策的時候了，千萬莫再躊躇不決，自誤誤人，聽任日本問題長此陷於僵局，徒有利於以前的侵略國家。</p>

<h3 id="c50">緬甸加倫族叛亂的來龍去脈 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 許斯仁</p>
<p>加倫族在緬甸各種民族之中，算是第二大族，（第一大族緬甸族）其人口總數，據戰前的統計是一·三四一·〇六六人，佔全緬人口十分之一，散佈區域大多在下緬甸的三角洲，和緬南的薩爾溫江沿岸一帶。據英國學者史蒂芬遜氏的考據，加倫族原屬於泰中國族，由我國滇省之一部移入緬甸，居住於上緬甸的東瓜山區一帶，後來有一部份遷至三角洲的巴森，西北部的阿拉干山南部，他們對於緬族初時抱着畏懼的心理，故不敢向緬甸區域遷移。迨至英人統治緬甸後，以多年平靜，才敢慢慢遷居到伊拉瓦底江，三角洲，和丹那沙令區等平原地帶來。加倫民族性忠誠樸實，但無多大創造力，同族有紅加倫，紅加倫族中又分為黑加倫，斑加倫。紅，黑，斑三族的加倫的人口總約二十餘萬人，散佈區域大多在東瓜一帶的山上，前面康貝爾氏信中所指的「山上朋友」即係指這些紅加倫而言。</p>
<p>加倫族原沒有文字和歷史的紀載，初時他們只有自然的傳統，一代傳至一代，俟英緬首次戰爭後，才由英·美教士替他們發明文字，但大部以緬甸文字為基礎，其字母計有子音廿五個，母音七個。他們同居的以緬甸人較多之故，故大都懂得緬文和緬語，風俗習慣也與緬人無甚差異，惟加倫人都係信基督教，緬甸人則信佛教，這大抵是受英國的影響。因為加倫人的文化是由英國傳來的，大部份的加倫人，都受有中等英文教育，過去英國統治緬甸時，在加倫族的住區，無不都辦有教會英文學校，故加倫男女都得有受英國教育的機會。</p>
<p>正因為這些教育上和宗教上的關係，所以加倫族大都是親英的；也正因為這樣的關係，在過去英國統治緬甸時期，地方行政官員不少是加倫人，緬甸的國防軍也是以加倫人為基幹，他們奉英人的意旨，執行統治者的工作，故深為緬甸人所不滿。但在過去英國統治時代，尚不致有什麼互相敵對的事件發生，迄至日軍佔領緬甸時，以受着日軍的挑撥離間，因而發生瞭一次互相殘殺的慘劇，雙方死傷達萬餘人，因而種下了兩民族互相仇恨的禍根，影響到這一次的民族戰爭悲劇終於發生了。</p>
<p>對於這次的加緬氏族戰爭，記者認為最可慮的，是將因此而種下了更為根深蒂固的禍根。因為戰事一發，戰區的行政官員即退走後方，緬甸軍隊中又缺少政治部的組織，任憑軍隊去胡攪一通，故時有失去政治常軌的事情發生。好比有一天記者到戰區去採訪新聞時，一個緬甸軍隊問記者看不看加倫死屍，記者問他怎樣打死的，他說是昨天進攻加倫村時，在村里抓到了六個加倫人，就把他（她）們押到河邊打死了。自然，那六個加倫人是不是騷動者，不無尚有問題，緬甸軍這麼未經審問就把他們槍殺，這會迫使加倫人更加仇恨緬甸人了。</p>
<p>循環報復</p>
<p>又一個緬甸軍官會為記者講述一個悽慘的故事，但那講故事的緬甸軍官卻得意揚揚，他說：「有一次我們攻下一個加倫村，村裏的加倫人都走光了，但在一間頗精緻的加倫住宅的廚房裏，我們發現了一個十六七歲的妙齡少女，也許她是來不及逃走的。她看到我們便很恐慌，自稱她是緬甸人，說隻要我們不殺害她的生命，任憑我們怎樣都可以。我們說：我們不要你，你們的加倫男人破壞我們的風紀，我們是要報復的，後來我們對她說我們帶你給和尚發落好了。因為和尚主張殺，於是我們就把她殺掉了。」說到這裏，他且做着殺頭的手勢，并說明那女孩子的頭是怎樣落下去的。自戰事發生後，兩族的軍隊強姦對族的婦女，和互相殺害對族平民的消息，時時都可以聽到。除此之外，緬甸軍又採取一种焦土政策，凡是加倫村落，不管它有沒有騷動者，都不惜一把火把它統統燒掉。加倫軍為報復起見，每攻下緬甸人的地區時，也採取同樣的手段對會緬甸人。記者曾經拜訪過一家房屋被焚的緬甸人，他憤憤地說：「我一家所賴以溫飽的只有這一些了，這些狗養的（指焚他房屋的加倫人）竟這麼沒天良地焚盡我的所有，我是永久要住在此地的，以後總有見面的日子！」像這樣的事情，無不都是足以促成兩民族仇恨的加深，這毒菌的根苗如不趕快把它拔下去，即使這次的戰爭得以和平解決，將來難免再有第二次的戰事發生的。</p>
<p>武器來源</p>
<p>這次加倫族所持以騷亂的武器來源，大約得自下列各方面：（一）日軍遺留下來的。因為日軍自緬北緬中敗退後，所有的兵力都集中在緬南，隔錫河與盟軍對峙。後來日本投緬，緬南的日軍也自動解除武器。緬甸的三十餘萬日本軍所卸下的武器，除一部交給英軍接收外，餘者大部份落在加倫族之手。（二）當盟軍反攻緬甸時，曾於一九四五年二月間，由布拉爾上校率領第一三六團降落於加倫區，組織加倫游擊隊，戰後這些游擊隊大部份編成緬甸國防軍。緬甸獨立後，也許是英人有意遺毒，這些國防軍表面上雖告遣散，但暗中卻化整為零，武器自然依舊存在。除此兩道之外，上面已曾說過，緬甸政府是認為英國人曾暗中在給予加倫人以武器的。</p>
<p>問題癥結</p>
<p>這次加緬衝突的問題，其所以令人覺到難於解決的，是加倫族堅持非讓他們那建邦分治不可，而政府卻以其有嚴重的利害關係，不能俯如所請。緬甸政府所提出的理由，是說加倫族所要求劃分的區域，有些地方加倫居民隻佔百分之卅，有些地方只佔百分之十九，根本就沒有建立另一民族國家的可能性，且經濟方面也不無問題。我們站在第三者的立場說句公道話，加倫族固有權利要求分治，但所提出的要求未免過分一點，因為加倫族所要求劃分的區域，盡是些富饒的區域。代緬甸政府說句坦白話，當是：「好的你通通要云，我還有什麼？」然而利害關係尚不止此，最緊要的還是港口問題。加倫族所要求劃分的區域，如巴森·丹老等地。都是可能停舶洋輪的港口，要是政府準予劃這些地方給加倫建邦，以加倫過去和英國的關係為捲土重來的跳板，也必利用加倫區作為經濟侵略的淵藪。所以緬甸政府要是讓加倫建邦，那無異是自己把荷包挖一個洞，所以緬甸政府才堅持不能答應加倫族的建邦要求。</p>
<p>未來展望</p>
<p>加緬衝突和利害關係已如上述，故這次的事件確實是一件頗難解決的事件。三月一日印度政府曾召集東南亞英國各聯邦，在印度開一個非正式的會議，討論調停加緬辦法。討論結果，由各與會的國家（計包括印度·巴基斯坦·澳大利亞·英國·錫蘭）聯名致函緬甸內閣總理泰金諾，要求調集加緬衝突，但緬甸政府尚未予等答覆。這衝突要是無法和平解決的話，加倫族既已擁有如上所述的地區和武器，兼着大部份的加倫青年都是具有軍事常識的，且團結勇敢，那末緬甸今後的命運，將遭逢到更大的不幸，是在意料之中的。（全文完）</p>

<p>首塲三組胖隊戰崇德，按胖隊C部第五名，崇德D部殿軍，前者在分部賽中曾勝健樂鐵聯，鬥力尚可，後者師出以還，從未奏捷，屆時兩軍對壘，胖隊勝利希望較濃。</p>
<p>繼之二組康隊與華南角逐，該組係各分部之第三第四各隊，康隊原屬A部，華南則　B部，康隊在老將陸大振領導擁有童廷煊王長安容承恩周　琅等少壯派，長力充沛。而華南如何涵夫黃天烈李賢政輩亦屬沙廠久戰，兩軍相值當有殺搏演出。</p>
<p>壓軸戰第一組D部冠軍汕隊，與A部亞軍懋勛交綏，汕隊在陳淸江羅少瓊鄭國藩等支持下，仍保持其快速之作風，在D部中先後擊退晨友浦水崇德紅騎獲　該部冠軍，今為爭取前八席名位，必以全力出戰。懋勛為A部中之佼佼者，麾將孫家斐劉昭仁卓觀仁楊繼震等均有優異成績，乍逢強敵，當知謹慎應付，而臺戰之烈，必多精彩也。</p>

<p>今日甲組賽華聯出戰郵乙</p>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽前日甲組華美連戰郵乙郵務昆仲於郵務球室，到觀眾四百餘人，球塲為之水泄不通，情緒熱烈，華美實力雄厚，獲勝自在意中，惟兩員主將演出狀態未及理想，如精於長抽短壓之薛緒初，抽擊慌張，首戰郵乙老將喻春榮，喻以近擋球還擊，使緒初陷於苦戰，第二局兩竟打成廿五平等，薛賴最後一記得分，始得以直落二取勝。次仗緒初出戰小將王傳耀，擊來仍失常態，傳耀力敵不退，兩局比較均在領先下反勝為敗，如能稍予鎮定，大有戰勝希望，在塲觀眾咸謂緒初倖運未遭毒手。另如全材宿將陸漢俊於次塲首組中對郵務劉造時之戰，雖盡力週旋，但終以一對二慘敗，幸次組秦都燕力取對方抽手姜春山，得以渡過危險，綜觀華美因李宗沛傅其芳兩將缺席，影響鬥力，若薛陸再有差池，則此後遇勁敵精武聯星華聯全綠等四強，恐有變化發生。郵乙賴朱慶基戰勝華美小將薛偉初，打破零分記錄，郵務沉着抵抗，雖以二對三受挫，可謂雖敗猶榮。結果華美雙喜臨門，保持五戰五勝之戰績。茲探錄兩塲戰績如下：</p>
<p>（華美）　比數　（郵乙）</p>
<p>王九慶　二—〇　沈愛仁</p>
<p>陸漢俊　二—〇　朱仲孫</p>

<p>薛緒初　二—〇　王傳耀</p>
<p>王九慶　二—〇　楊培天</p>
<p>韓德　　一—二　莊坤榮</p>
<p>今日（十一日）續有甲組一塲，乙組三塲，甲組由華聯出戰郵乙於國貨球室，華聯曾出馬兩次皆獲勝利，惟硬抽健將鄧秀榮尚未參戰，實力頗受影響，餘如張志鴻盧文良李震等均屬老將，鋒芒雖已稍歛，但頭腦淸楚，作戰經騐異常豐富，郵乙亦多沙塲舊人，惟全隊缺乏上佳之攻球人才，吃虧不少，今戰華聯，必出全力相拼。茲探錄今日秩序如下：</p>
<p>華聯—郵乙（甲組）七時國貨</p>
<p>帆聲—中農（乙二）七時中農</p>
<p>美亞—郵三（乙三）七時郵務</p>

<p>夏季需用最殷之冰塊，今年大部份恐仍將仰給於浦東一帶之人造冰，機器製冰業因電費及人工等負荷太重，兼以原料如亞摩尼亞等價格極昂，產量頗難樂觀。至各影戲院舞廳每年夏季必須裝設之冷氣設備，據該兩業表示，今年將營業情形如何而定，娛樂業在夏季例稱「淡季」，預料今年翼座慘淡，必更甚於往年，倘果如是，則冷氣設備縱使照例裝置，其開放必將延緩至盛暑極端溽熱之時。</p>
<p>冷飲品類目前已告大量應市，以一般大眾之購買力而言，其定價均不能謂低，如大冰磚一塊售三二〇萬元，紙杯冰淇淋售六十萬元，可口可樂及汽水每瓶五十萬元，棒冰每根需十二萬元，根據近數日業各較大經售店之平均統計，除棒冰及汽水外，其他實銷，均未能達到去年初夏之理想紀錄。</p>

<p>各界慰勞　希改實物</p>
<p>（一）國軍士兵戰門情緒極為旺盛，對戰門目標之認識尤為清楚，渠等一致認為江南撤退并非戰敗，咸感無限悲憤。（二）目前前綫國軍最缺乏日用品，醫護人才，及精神食糧，希望後方民眾能深切瞭解此點，經常予以協助支持，渠等表示尤歡迎各界實際來前綫視察，俾能相互溝通。（三）國軍士兵待遇仍須迅謀改善，上月每人實得僅折合銀元一元左右，即郵費亦常感不敷，加之目前各前綫地區日用品奇缺，無法添購鞋襪衫褲等，故渠等希望今後各界如有慰勞金頒發，可改發同值之實用物品，不必再發銀元。（四）渠等希望家眷能由當局妥為照料安頓，俾渠等能專心作戰。</p>

<p>— 章明</p>
<p>〔桂林二日訊〕嶺表春遲，加之這一個月來漫天　雨，獨秀峯嶺總是瀰漫在銀色的煙霧裏，這兒好久沒有太陽，人們還披上一件大衣，剛從廣州回來的朋友帶來海濱的人早已過着盛夏的信息，能不會使在冬天裏蟄伏的人們羨煞！剛好第一聲春雷在前幾天晚上響出了，春從黑夜裏帶到桂林，多少被生活折磨够了的人，吐一吐　氣，他們呌喊着：「冬天過了，春天不是來了嗎」？</p>
<p>這日子，桂林，正瀰漫了春的氣息，春的腳步大大地跨着來，——在孩子們的歡呼裏，在老農夫的微笑裏，在更多人的熱情的期待裏。</p>
<p>從環湖之濱，月牙山，以及桃花江畔，成雙成對的青年學生，抑不住無邊的春意，嘴裏哼出那些撩人的句子：「春，帶給我們醉人的暖風，吹來了花一般的夢……」</p>
<p>享着上千年「山水甲天下」盛名的桂林，這時又怎不惹起更多人的嚮往？我曾為朋友解釋「桂林山水可愛處」——這樣類似的難題，這理由是：「這裏的山水可愛，幷不是她的形勢，而是她的顏色；我不以為任何一種山水都是雄偉或者清奇，而是那些些裹着她隱藏於薄薄地被裏，那些淡淡，冷冷，蒼翠欲滴的綠的新裝」。</p>
<p>懂得玩「桂林山水」的朋友們，他是不取乎天晴的日子，而最好是選定濛烟細雨的時候，在烟雨去中看桂林山水，才更有「獨得之秘」。</p>
<p>近來，雖然淅淅瀝瀝斷斷續續地下着那「討厭」的雨，却是懷着雅興的人照常尋山問水，他們的發現，是「不足為俗人道」的，這時登高開閣，撲面迎來是一山嵐雨，一江空翠，誰還會想到戰爭？想到殺戮？本來綠色是有些和平的象徵的，正如白象徵純潔，黃象徵萎謝和紅象徵熱烈一樣，看綠，人就會自然而然的想到豐饒的田野，想到安靜的村莊，可以把一顆真純的心完全寄在那無涯的綠影裏。</p>
<p>在戰前，桂林環城諸山大都是不能臨高遠望戰時因為軍事上的需要，開闢不少山路，在今天——戰後，才便利了不少的「雅人」，像象鼻山這個「華南屏障」，現在大可以拾級而上，同時離城最近，路級寬闊，所以招徠遊人也最多，玩象鼻山的人最好從象頸沿象鼻而下，假如是胆量較大，直不妨垂腰到河灘，赤足走在裸露的小黑石上，苔痕轉染着腳趾，當然又是別一番新鮮滋味，再若駕着小艇，江水冷綠得侵衣袖，一聲款乃，一片灘聲，呼嘯着過去，如果又伴着雨峯一派的簫吹雨韻，這時的感覺，紫洲烟雨真夠令人體味的。</p>
<p>儘管北天烽火燎原，物價漫天呌漲，「尋春」的人那管洲桂黔鐵路罷工，和西大龍課，他們乘與東渡春瀾，沿郊踏青的不少。不過遺憾的是：沒有人想到藉用賣餛飩的担子坐，到那鮮黃的菜　中，酒溫猜枚，徒使沈三百，陳芸娘專美於前，可見現代的人比起昔日的雅人勝緻還是俗得多了。那些穿紅着綠的男女，並肩搭背，唧唧噥噥，誰知道他們是真的尋春呢？還是別有「醉翁之意」？</p>
<p>清明過後，一位朋友去上墳，在月牙山的「壽佛爺」求一簽示「利」，隨手抽得一枝「和平簽」說得好：「冤家欲報仇，容忍自然休，忍之即無事，鬥之便有憂」。</p>
<p>不要再效前人這般　息罷：「春色難當，酒盃常淺，更舊恨新仇相間，五更風，千里夢，看飛紅幾片，這般庭院……」庭院裏，終難免就從此把歎息收拾，正不少在苦難裏度日的人，他們是把春忘記了的，春離開了人——那還多的不幸的人羣很遠很遠……</p>
<h3 id="c90">入超的城市：福州 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 川平</p>
<p>〔福州廿六日訊〕福州街頭出現了許多軍人，十輪軍用卡車馳騁在福州狹小的街道上，不時把行人和黃包車吞噬下去。公共體育場竟然排列起小型坦克來。即使最愚蠢的老百姓也都知道福州在變。她本來是一個最溫柔寗靜的處子，而現在却被化裝為戰士，然而她的芳心中却祗有一個觀念：「愛和平」。外表雖然未必能轉變內心的傾向，但是強烈的外力往往會收到若干效果，福州正在變。</p>
<p>福州市民們最關切的却不是未來的命運，而是目前不斷威脅他們生存的瘋狂物價。物價正如水位，一個地方物價高漲時，其他地方必然要受到它的影響。福州不同閩南，它受港粵市場的干擾似乎輕微些，領導福州物價的是上海市場。祗要打開上海報紙的市情欄看，就可以知道福州物價的大略情形。但是福州的物價却與上海的物價保持着若干限度的差異。把兩地同日的市價來比較，福州還比較低廉些，似乎福州的生活該過得較容易些。然而，事實上却不如此。由於福州是一個在貿易上　　入超的城市，福州沒有大工廠，除了一個電力公司的烟囱之外，找不到第二家有烟囱的工廠了。勞力在福州顯得特別低廉，許多人祗得出省工作去。留在福州的眷屬則靠着匯回來的款子生活。但是京滬匯千元到福州來，就得化上三百五十元的手續費，而且輾轉多時，當一筆匯款送遞到家屬的手中時，已經貶值得可憐了，所以福州物價看來比京滬便宜，而大部份福州市民却過着極苦生活。</p>
<p>平心而論，福州畢竟算是幸運。前些時由於銀行頭寸有限，銀根較緊，遊資的猖獗也不太猛烈，義序機場在修整，各綫航機兩星期來都未在此降落，福州的物價由於缺乏頭寸總算欲振無力。甚至如布疋等的價格却較上海略廉。這種銷售地的市價較生產地市價低廉的現象，自然祗是暫時的，然而市民能夠在此時喘一口氣也就算不錯了。銀根緊對於某些企圖在市場上興風作浪的人，自然是一個嚴重的打擊。省參議會開會時，竟然有一位參議員提議請央行把印鈔機搬一架來福州，解決鈔荒。即將在榕成立的央行閩台區域行傳說將携印刷機來，以便供應在閩大軍的給養費，鈔票印刷機雖然沒有來，而　　本票印刷機已經開始日夜趕印了。前幾天公教人員按新待遇補發三月份薪津，物價在幾小時內馬上升漲一倍，金鈔袁頭身價百倍，米價也跟蹤而進。貨幣價值決定於貨幣數量的經濟理論，在這裏得到最正確的證明。</p>
<p>儘管商店的售價開始以烙赤金為本位，普通市民們所最關切的却不是金價，而是米價，民以食為天，誰能夠不吃飯度日？而且金價多多少少總得受國內其他金融市場的影響，米價則除了在金價騰漲的時候也比例上漲之外，本身的供需情形又形成另一價格變動的原因。福建原是一個缺糧的省份，戰前需要洋米，戰時靠着積轂和贛米度過一些日子，戰後洋米仍然不來，就祗好再靠贛米，而贛米是需要以閩鹽交換的。勝利之後江西所需的食鹽已無需專靠福建市場，閩鹽在贛省已不如戰時吃香，於是福建的糧食供應深受影響。月前盛傳經合署已允將福州廈門列入美援糧食的配給區，市當局並且準備四月一日開始計口配糧。福州市民正額手稱慶的當兒，消息傳來，美糧無意駕臨福州。轉眼青黃不接期到，且看能否作無米之炊！</p>
<p>除白色恐怖外，福州市民還在擔心　　洪水和鼠疫去年曾造成空前未有的大水災，現在大家的希望似乎都寄託在即將設立的福州港務局，希望它能夠利用挖泥機把入海口水道濬深些，則下游宣洩通暢，洪患或許可以倖免。日來市區賢南路一帶發現鼠疫，當局正勸導市民加緊撲鼠，但要來的終究要來，在春夏之交，福州又將籠罩於恐怖疫氛之下，今年，誰將是疫神黑名單中的人物呢？</p>
<h3 id="c91">大涼山恩仇記　（上） <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>險阻連關石，迢遙控蜀</p>
<p>偏師頻覆沒，上將屢未征</p>
<p>月冷烏蠻國，霜寒孟護城</p>
<p>烽烟猶未靖，刁斗幾回驚</p>
<p>夷族代表團前年帶給了京滬人士情趣別緻的歌舞，最近各地公演的「大涼山恩仇記」這幕話劇，亦曾給人難忘的山野情調，而今活的大涼山恩仇記在寗屬地區上演，上萬的夷族同胞又在大渡河邊捉對廝殺，昔年諸葛亮七擒孟獲之處，翼王石達開偏師覆沒的地方，重已烽烟四處了。</p>
<p>這次戰爭是由「寗屬靖邊司令」之爭而起，而今年二月開始惡化，到現在戰鬥更加激烈，除了爭「司令」的鄧德亮及孫仿各擁有兩團夷兵漢將外，西昌警備司令賀國光已準備調國軍一六三師加入戰鬥，幫助孫仿討伐鄧德亮。這塊蠻荒之地，誰也不知何日再得寗靜！</p>
<p>所謂「寗屬」，是指西康設省之時由川南劃歸的八縣一設治局而言，因為西昌舊稱寗遠府，屬縣凡八（西昌，會理，越雋，冕寗，鹽源，鹽邊，寗南，昭覺）設治局一（寗東），此外還有十六個政治區，東連烏蒙，西接鹽井，南及金沙江，北至大渡河，延袤千餘里，其間崇嶺四塞，山深水激，岳峯聳秀，邛池托藍，原壞膏腴，礦產豐富，且地當川康滇黔之交，樂西，西祥兩公路之會，乃西南重鎮，西昌警備司令部，由重慶綏靖公署副主任賀國光兼任司令坐鎮於此。</p>
<p>這帶地方，水秀山青，漢夷雜居其間，據估計連深藏大涼山及小相嶺諸穹崖深林，未開化的黑夷等一併計算，共有一百六十萬夷人。對付這百多萬文明程度深淺不齊的夷人，向靠靖邊司令部的武力。靖邊部武力，為老司令鄧秀延一手所創，渠本漢人，匹馬單槍，　　深入夷區，打出了這片天下。夷人所最敬慕之人物，首推蔣委員長，其次就是瀘沽之鄧秀延司令，富林之羊仁安將軍，前者制夷以威不以德，後者以德不以威，鄧秀延真刀真槍，在寗屬夷區樹立了這麼幾十年穩固專制的政權，糾紛的產生，在於三十三年八月，他死後「皇權」的繼承。</p>
<p>鄧秀延死後，賀國光對於夷務的看法是：「皇兒年幼，呂后昏庸，不可干政，亞父忠義，可託孤以攝政」。（賀國光致劉文輝電）。今天的局面而正是呂后挾皇兒對抗亞父之爭。</p>
<p>「皇兒」德亮皇兄者鄧德亮，今年二十三歲，在他父親死後，就世襲寗屬靖邊司令，當時不過十九歲，大權操於生母鄧呂仙，鄧老太太今年已六十餘歲，為人陰沉、精悍、潑辣，其夫在世之時，即已操有夷人生殺大權，提起鄧老太太，無人不怕。其夫歿後，更是橫行無忌，對夷人不斷壓榨，鄧秀延雖以威治夷，但究竟還寬猛並濟，鄧老太太則只知貪婪，於是深為夷人所不滿，三年前唆使其子無故仇殺了一位托烏的夷族領袖，招致寗屬漢夷人士普遍的不滿，鄧德亮才被迫外出，偕其舅到南京步兵專科學校去受訓，兵權於是完全落到靖邊副司令孫仿手裏。</p>
<p>孫仿即是賀國光所指的亞父（夷人），是老司令的結拜兄弟，當年曾伴隨鄧秀延　　南征北討，立下不少汗馬功勞，得鷹任靖邊副司令，雖年已六十餘歲，但為人思想開明，行為進步，深得夷人的擁戴，前年出席第一屆國民代表大會之時曾率夷族觀光團到京滬一帶觀摩，並深得西康省主席劉文輝及西昌警備司令賀國光的倚重，故賀國光盛譽其為人忠義，可以託孤攝政。</p>
<p>鄧德亮去年在京步校畢業以後，即被正式任命為寗屬靖邊司令，他的舅又被任命為夷兵團的團長，另一位姓蕭的兵校畢業同學被發表為參謀長。寗屬地方被這道命令震動了，夷胞見這位公子重回　政，不免大嘩，這時孫仿在南京，見子侄輩竟　此重任，表示不願歸去，可是劉文輝賀國光不能失掉了他，千催萬促，方始重返西昌，這就是留蓉渝，久久未歸的原因。</p>
<p>孫仿回西昌之前，曾在成都與劉文輝有過商談，所以不久國防部又頒了另一道命令，任孫仿為寗屬靖邊代司令，鄧德亮則調夷兵團長，這對於剛由京都學成歸來，野心勃勃的鄧德亮，如何肯服，頑固的鄧老太太更心有不甘，於是暗自召集舊部，準備廝殺，孫仿自亦早有所聞，陳兵以待了。</p>
<p>這樣醞釀了好幾個月，地方人士一再斡旋都沒有成功，恰巧新任重慶綏署主任張羣到職，賀國光被邀來渝，籌商西南大計，鄧德亮認為時機成熟，今年二月在瀘沽父親的老巢，自動以「靖邊司令」之位，並下令「討伐」孫仿。其「敬告寗屬父老書」之一段曰：</p>

<p>「：：德亮承地方人士之愛護，軍政長官之嘉勉，不以菲材，亮以大任，繼承遺職，於今四載，每念才能之不足，恐有負於地方人士之厚望，於是乃邀請與先父半生戎馬相交最篤之孫仿氏，出而扶助，俾收有效，承孫氏不齊，慨然允諾，鄭重表示，澈底維護，以報先父生平之誼，由是感激不禁涕零者矣。自此一切信賴，未嘗稍疑，以是先父一手造成之靖邊武力，全部交彼全權負責：：：乘德亮求學期間，頃起野心，意欲將先父慘淡經營之靖邊武力，據為己有。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Army Counter-Attacks and Recovers Liuhe; Communist Army Invades Jiashan's Northern Suburbs but is Repelled; Situation in Jiujiang Remains Unchanged, West Bank of Hukou Still Firmly Defended <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military source at 11:00 AM on the 10th: Regarding Liuhe Township, our army launched a counter-offensive last night (9th), achieving a great victory. Order in the township has returned to normal. The results of the battle are being tallied, and the bandits in the area are fleeing northwest.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] According to a military dispatch released at 10:00 PM on May 10th: (1) After Liuhe was recovered by our army on the 10th, the bandits immediately fled northwest. There are no longer any traces of bandits south of Liuhe and east of Liudu Bridge. (2) A certain unit of our garrison in Jiading dispatched strong forces on the morning of the 10th to conduct a forceful search in the Tangtang area. They encountered a bandit reconnaissance company, resulting in a fierce battle for two hours, after which the bandits were unable to withstand the assault and fled north. (3) At dawn on the 10th, over a thousand plainclothes bandits, coming from Xitang north of Jiashan, attempted to harass Jiashan's northern suburbs. The garrison immediately met them with a head-on attack. After a fierce battle of two hours, the bandits retreated. Furthermore, west of Jiashan, we are still in a stalemate with a portion of the 85th Division of the Communist 29th Army. (4) Approximately 1,500 bandits from the 252nd Regiment of the 84th Division of the Communist 28th Army are entrenched in Jiaxing city, with over 600 bandits occupying the West Barracks. (5) On the 9th, over 400 bandits from Suzhou, poorly equipped, attempted to harass the Jiaozhi Township and Chenmu Township area. (6) According to people arriving from Wuxi: After Wuxi was invaded by the bandits, it was reorganized as a city, with Gu Feng appointed as mayor and Xie Kedong as deputy secretary of the municipal committee. On April 28th, the Communist military control commission convened a meeting with over one hundred representatives from public and private factories, forcing the factories to resume work and restore production immediately. However, because the Communist side provides each worker with only one *sheng* of rice per day in wages and food, making it impossible to make a living, many workers have fled elsewhere to seek a livelihood. (7) According to refugees fleeing from Changshu: After Suzhou fell into the hands of the bandits, they actively searched and plundered food from the people, forcibly requisitioned vehicles and boats, and a large number of civilian laborers, making it difficult for the people to survive.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military source at 10:00 AM on the 10th: (1) In recent days, our small units have continuously launched attacks, achieving brilliant victories and high morale. People from various places have offered condolences and assistance, with both the military and the people holding firm to a belief in certain victory. (2) At noon on the 9th, a unit of our army attacked the intersection of the railway and highway west of Kunshan, killing over 200 bandits. (3) On the 9th, over a thousand bandits advanced towards the Dongxinmu Bridge in Taicang. After an hour of fierce fighting, over 200 bandits were killed, and the bandits, unable to withstand the assault, retreated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 10th] Military news: (1) The situation in Jiujiang remains unchanged today, and the west bank of Hukou is still controlled and defended by the National Army. (2) External communications from Linchuan were temporarily interrupted yesterday afternoon, but long-distance telephone communications from Nancheng County remain open. (3) Shangbu in Xian County changed hands. (4) Nanchang Garrison Commander Hu Su has gone to Zhangshu to take command.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Air Force Conducts Search and Bombing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] In addition to supporting the National Army troops on the outskirts of Greater Shanghai today, the Air Force also conducted search and bombing operations deep behind the Communist army's supply lines. West of Nanjing, in the Dangtu River, they destroyed a 1,000-ton Communist motorized vessel. In Wuxing and Shaoxing, they destroyed a total of thirteen trucks in the Communist army's motorcade. At the Baxi Port in Jiangyin, they sank one hundred of the three hundred wooden boats used by the Communist army to cross the river from the south. Over four hundred Communist soldiers and dozens of tons of military supplies on board were also sunk.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Central China Strategic Deployment is Sound; Battle to Defend Wuhan Begins; Curfew Advanced by Two Hours Every Evening <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] "The long-awaited battle to defend Wuhan officially commenced yesterday morning at Lianglukou, 30 kilometers north of Hankou. Approximately 600 soldiers from Lin Biao's Communist force encountered the defending troops, resulting in a battle lasting one hour, with over 100 bandits killed. Near noon, the bandits reinforced with over 1,000 additional soldiers, and the battle shifted to the line of Hengshan Lijia Gang, continuing fiercely into the night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] The 10th was the second day of the battle to defend Wuhan. At 1:00 AM, over 1,000 bandits from Lin Biao's force, taking advantage of poor visibility at night, attacked our Fengheshan position on the outskirts of Hankou, while also feigning attacks on Lijia Gang and Putuan Temple, attempting to encircle Fengheshan. Another unit, using eight civilian boats from Huanghualao, attempted to secretly cross the river to Dalijia Dun, but were discovered by our garrison. Three boats were sunk. Commander Lu Daoyuan, upon receiving the report, ordered the garrison to flank and counter-attack Fengheshan from both sides. The battle continued until dawn, at which point the bandits were unable to withstand the assault and fled to Xujiamiao, Huangjiafan, Huanghualao, and other places. At noon, they again attempted to secretly cross the river to Sandao Qiao north of Chenjiaji, and our army immediately went to sweep them out. By 10:00 PM, they were still confronting our army in the Xiekou Xujiamiao area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] Lately, unfounded rumors have been circulating in Wuhan, causing considerable unease. To clarify the military situation near Wuhan, this reporter visited a responsible official at the Central China Military and Political Headquarters to inquire about the truth. He was told that the Communist troops on the Pinghan front have been gradually moving south. The southward movement of the troops under our Third Army Corps to Wuhan is purely to complete the strategic deployment. The Wuhan city defense works have been completed and are very strong. The entire Central China strategic defense is solid, and if the Communists invade, they will be met with a significant blow. The purpose of evacuating residents and non-combat personnel, as well as military supplies, is to reduce unnecessary losses due to the war. Furthermore, water transport on the Yangtze River from Hankou and above, and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, are still open. Hankou to Jiujiang is also unobstructed. The claim that water and land transportation are blocked is entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hankou, 10th] The wartime atmosphere in Wuhan is becoming increasingly intense. The Garrison Command has stipulated that, starting from the evening of the 10th, the curfew will be advanced by two hours, from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM the following morning.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Front Line in Jimo is Quiet; Communist Army Has No Activity <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 10th] The front line in Jimo is quiet. After suffering a disastrous defeat, the Communist army has no activity. Our strong navy continues to send ships to patrol the sea west of the city to monitor the activities of the Communist army on Xuejia Island. Currently, the two sides are facing each other in the Zhangjiawan area, without any large-scale contact. Furthermore, wounded National Army soldiers defending Qingdao have been transported to hospitals in the city for treatment. Commander An Qi of the 11th Pacification District and labor groups from all sectors visited them today to offer condolences.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Fuel Sources Difficult in Nanjing; Water and Electricity Only Supplied to Government Offices <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to a businessman who recently fled from Nanjing to Shanghai: Due to the decline in currency value, the emergence of a black market, and the lack of fuel, soldiers riding trains or attending theaters without tickets, the Communist Nanjing Military Control Commission recently issued a public notice stating: (1) One hundred Hua Zhong currency notes are equivalent to one Renminbi. Citizens should use this ratio uniformly and must not refuse to accept it or establish a black market exchange rate. (2) Due to difficulties in obtaining fuel, Nanjing's water and electricity can only be supplied to government offices first. All government offices should pay close attention to conservation and must not waste resources. (3) It has been found that "a small number" of personnel from our army are buying train tickets or entering entertainment venues without following the prescribed procedures. The people are encouraged to report such incidents at any time, and all units should strictly prohibit their personnel from going out without reason.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] According to a responsible official of the Wuhan Garrison Command, a few prominent figures in Wuhan have been secretly meeting in a certain venue and in their private residences, brewing a local peace movement and organizing a so-called "Wuhan Public Order Maintenance Committee," hoping to come forward to contact the Communists in the event of an emergency in Wuhan. When that failed, they turned to covert activities, promoting ×× as the person in charge of the Hubei Maintenance Committee and ×× as the person in charge of the Hankou Maintenance Committee. They also planned to delay the shortfall in the Central China region's military supplies as much as possible, increasing the difficulties in supplying the military, alienating the military and the people, spreading rumors every day, falsely reporting military information, promoting defeatist sentiments, currying favor with the Communists, in order to preserve their lives and property, and a few even thinking of seizing the puppet regime. The military is well aware of this kind of conscienceless, treacherous trick, and has obtained important evidence. Continuing to suppress the rebellion has been the government's decision, and the conspiracy of this committee should be strictly prohibited. If they do not cease their activities and continue to act as if they are colluding with the enemy, they will be severely punished according to Article 11 of the Martial Law and the Ten Urgent Measures for Wuhan Public Order that have been promulgated and made known.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Defend Greater Shanghai; Second Day of Propaganda Week; Expanded Radio Propaganda Conducted <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday was the second day of the "Defend Greater Shanghai, Anti-Communist Propaganda Week" organized by all sectors of this city. Personnel from the city's broadcasting industry, in response to the call for propaganda, conducted expanded radio propaganda throughout the day at the Shanghai Radio Station. Mayor Chen Liang, Party Chief Fang Zhi, Gu Zhenggang, Standing Committee Member of the Political Affairs Committee of the Jinghu Hang Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Taixiang, representative of Commander Chen, and Tan Yimin were specially invited to deliver broadcasts.</p>
<p>Gu Zhenggang's Broadcast</p>
<p>Demanding Shanghai Compatriots to Achieve Five Things</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Mr. Gu Zhenggang, Standing Committee Member of the Political Affairs Committee of the Jinghu Hang Garrison Headquarters, delivered a broadcast yesterday at the invitation of the city's anti-communist and national salvation propaganda week. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Compatriots:</p>
<p>The cunning and ferocious face of the Communist Party has been fully exposed. The Communist Party's military aggression has expanded to Shanghai. To protect the lives and property of the people of Shanghai, to strive for the freedom of life for the people of Shanghai, and to maintain the independent survival of the entire nation, and to save the calamity of national subjugation, we should rise up together, concentrate our strength, align our steps, give them a head-on blow, to defend our Greater Shanghai, to strive for the final victory of the anti-communist war.</p>
<p>We know that the Communist Party is the Fifth Column of the Third International. It has no national position and no national concept. In his declaration opposing the North Atlantic Treaty on April 4th of this year, Mao Zedong openly advocated that in the Third World War, he would support the Soviet Union and fight alongside them. He also changed the title of the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China, and used the flag with the sickle and hammer as our national flag. Think about it, isn't this trying to make China a vassal of the Soviet Union? If the Communist Party seizes power, China will surely face the fate of national subjugation, and the 450 million compatriots will become slaves of a conquered nation.</p>
<p>We know that the Communist Party is a violent group. It puts on a layer of democratic and free sugar-coating, but hides the poison of violent autocracy. The cruel facts of liquidation and struggle in the Communist-occupied areas are terrifying. Even in Beiping and Tianjin, in areas where they advocate urban policies and call for democracy and freedom, their deprivation of the people's freedom and oppression of the people's actions have made the people lose all freedom in their lives. Therefore, under their violent autocracy, the lives and property of the people are absolutely not guaranteed, and the freedom of the people is completely deprived. If the Communist Party seizes power, think about it, can we still survive under this violent oppression? Won't the Chinese people suffer a tragic life of slavery?</p>
<p>The tragedy of national subjugation is about to befall us, and we must not sit idly by. We must rise up to save ourselves and save the country, expose the Communist Party's conspiracy to invade China for the Third International, recognize that this war is absolutely not a civil war, and unite to participate in the anti-aggression national war, participate in the anti-totalitarian democratic war, and participate in the sacred war to defend the independent survival of the nation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Compatriots! We must recognize the significance of this war. We must recognize that today's Greater Shanghai Defense War is the vanguard war to save the country from subjugation, strive for the victory of the Greater Shanghai Defense War, so that this great international city will not suffer the brutal destruction of the Communist bandits, so that the city's five million free citizens will not fall into the dark Iron Curtain, and even more to defend the independent survival of the nation, so as not to suffer the tragic fate of national subjugation. Its significance is so great! Therefore, I ask the people of Shanghai to achieve the following points in this war:</p>
<p>First, we must have a firm belief in victory: The Communist Party has become the Fifth Column of the Third International, wanting to destroy our country and enslave our people. It is more vicious than Qin Hui and more shameless than a traitor. It has also rebelled against the Chinese national spirit and violated the will of the 450 million Chinese people. Its rampant behavior is only temporary and will inevitably fail. Our war against aggression and totalitarianism, and for the independent freedom and survival of the nation, will join forces with the world's democratic and free united front to jointly eliminate international violent groups. We are justified and will surely win.</p>
<p>Second, we must have unified combat steps: For all wartime measures in this city, we must jointly support and implement them as one, so that the hearts of our five million citizens can be united as one, and the strength of our five million citizens can be united into a whole force. Such a strong combat body will naturally be invincible.</p>
<p>Third, we must not speculate or compromise: We must raise revolutionary vigilance, develop the revolutionary spirit, eliminate the psychology of defeatism, and strictly monitor and thoroughly eliminate speculators, compromisers, and spies. From past lessons, we believe that local peace is surrender, compromise halfway is destruction, and helping Communist bandits is treason.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must contribute money and effort: Shanghai has unlimited assets and vast manpower. This is precisely the capital for us to eliminate the Communist bandits, and this is precisely the weapon for us to strive for victory. I have said to the people of Shanghai before that we must go bankrupt to protect our property, and we must fight to protect our lives. Now is the time. Those who have money should take out money, and those who have strength should take out their strength. Do not let the Communist bandits liquidate our property and kill our lives.</p>
<p>Fifth, we must comfort the soldiers and rescue the wounded: Finally, I want to say to all of you, we have a firm determination and full preparation for the defense of Greater Shanghai. Countless brave soldiers in the front have formed an irresistible fortress, ready to give the invading enemy a serious blow. I hope that the people of Shanghai will offer more condolences to these heroes who are fighting, and quickly provide rescue to the wounded, to encourage morale and welcome victory.</p>
<p>Shanghai Compatriots! Fellow compatriots who do not want to be destroyed by the Communist bandits and do not want to be slaves of the Communist International! We must rise up, we must rise up regardless of men, women, old and young, occupation, and class, and use the strength of six million people to build an iron Great Wall to defend Greater Shanghai. We want to use Shanghai as the enemy's grave. We believe that Shanghai is the base for counter-attack. The war in Shanghai is the beginning of our victory.</p>
<p>Chen Liang's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>Enduring Hardships Will Surely Lead to Self-Salvation and National Salvation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Mayor Chen broadcasted on Shanghai Radio at 7:00 PM yesterday. The original text is as follows: Because of the breakdown of peace, the flames of war have approached the outskirts of our Greater Shanghai. The responsibility for defending Greater Shanghai has been added to the shoulders of all our citizens. Why do we want to suppress the rebellion and oppose communism? Because our Republic of China was established in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Although the Communist Party repeatedly claims to respect the Three Principles of the People, it actually does the opposite. In terms of nationalism, they only have the international line and absolutely no concept of nation. In terms of democracy, they only have one-party dictatorship, or even the autocracy of a very small number of people, and there is absolutely no democracy to speak of. In terms of people's livelihood, they absolutely do not allow freedom for the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, defending Greater Shanghai is not only the responsibility of the government and the army, but also the interest and life-and-death juncture of all Shanghai citizens themselves. In terms of military affairs, Commander-in-Chief Tang has made thorough arrangements, and the works on the four suburbs have made this city a complete fortress. Citizens can rest assured. However, the progress of military affairs depends on the cooperation of politics and economy, and the morale of the front depends on the encouragement of the people in the rear. Therefore, at this time of great crisis, on the one hand, we must be calm, respond calmly to changes, and at the same time, we must "be of one heart and one mind," "help each other in the same boat," "contribute money and effort," "go bankrupt to protect our property, and fight to protect our lives," "broaden our horizons," "lengthen our vision," "sacrifice the small self," and "preserve the big self." Shanghai is the essence of the country, with a large amount of manpower and materials. As long as we can work together and move towards the same goal, enduring the current hardships, we will surely be able to achieve the purpose of self-salvation and national salvation. During the Great War, most of the Soviet Union's territory had been occupied, and the German army advanced straight in, like a hot knife through butter. After the Battle of Stalingrad, the citizens of the Soviet Union participated in the war regardless of their own lives, and were finally able to turn the tide and achieve final victory. By analogy, the war in Shanghai can be absolutely optimistic. My duty is to "serve the citizens." Maintaining order in the urban area and stabilizing the lives of citizens is the focus of the entire municipal government at present. I am willing to share weal and woe with the city's six million citizens to complete the task of defending Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fang Zhi's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>Everything for the Front Line, Everything for the Soldiers</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Party Chief Fang Zhi broadcasted a speech during the "Defend Greater Shanghai, Anti-Communist Propaganda Week," stating roughly: "Today is the second day of the anti-communist propaganda week in this city. All compatriots in the city must know that the reason why we are anti-communist is because the Communist bandits are selling out the country and willingly acting as running dogs of the red imperialists. They are no longer Chinese, but complete traitors. The reason why we want to suppress the bandits is because the Communist bandits not only sell out the country and the nation, but also force the people and enslave the people, using them as cannon fodder. Today they rob one place, tomorrow they burn and kill another. Today there is struggle, tomorrow there is liquidation, so that husbands and wives, children and daughters cannot reunite in every family, and so that the people cannot live. Therefore, we cannot but suppress the bandits. In the past, we Chinese did not want to be subjugated by Japan, and now we should not want to be subjugated by the Communist International. Therefore, in order to save the country, we must suppress the bandits. Secondly, today we see how tragic and dark the lives of the people under the control of the Communist bandits are. If we compare ourselves with others, we should rise up to save the people who are also Chinese, in order to achieve the goal of saving the country and saving the people.</p>
<p>Now that we have understood the principle of anti-communism and bandit suppression, we must talk about how the citizens of Shanghai should rise up to do it, because if we want to save ourselves, we must first save others, and then further save the country. Defending Greater Shanghai is to defend the whole of China, because Shanghai is the largest city and the economic lifeline of the country. We should not be afraid and worried just because Nanjing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou have been occupied by the Communist bandits. We must realize that as long as we can defend Shanghai, the Communist bandits will be surrounded by us. Speaking of defending Shanghai, I am not saying that every ordinary person has to risk their lives. Now, there are hundreds of thousands of armed brothers risking their lives on the front line. They are risking their lives for us, and we should of course respect them. The people of Shanghai can still live today entirely because of these armed brothers who are fighting bloody battles on the front line. Therefore, here, I must appeal to all the compatriots in the city, those who have money should contribute money, those who have strength should contribute strength, and everyone should help the armed brothers. You must know that what they eat, wear, live in, and use is not as good as ours, and they are living the most difficult lives. We must send them the best things to eat, the best things to use, the best things to wear, and the best things to enjoy, which is what is called "everything for the front line" and "everything for the soldiers." Only in this way can there be true military-civilian cooperation, and only then can we be worthy of these national heroes.</p>
<p>Fellow citizens of the city, now is the final moment of life and death for us citizens of Shanghai. We must show our greatest character, and bring out the great revolutionary spirit of "January 28th" and "August 13th" in the past, to eliminate the Communist bandits and save the country and ourselves."</p>
<h3 id="e10">Secret Meeting in the Legislative Yuan: President He Reports on the Current Situation; The Government Resolves to Fight to the End and Details the Breakdown of Peace Talks <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] At 10:00 AM on the 10th, the President of the Executive Yuan, Ying Qin, presented a report on the current political, economic, military, and diplomatic situation at the 18th session of the Third Plenary Session of the Legislative Yuan, held in secret. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman and esteemed members:</p>
<p>The fact that your esteemed Yuan is continuing its Third Plenary Session in Guangzhou, the cradle of the revolution, cannot but make us recall the situation in which the Father of the Nation led the revolution in Guangzhou. At that time, the base of the Father of the Nation's leadership of the revolution was only the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, but after the sacrifice and struggle of countless martyrs, the corrupt forces were finally eliminated, and the country was unified, achieving the initial success of the revolution. Now that the Communist Party has broken the peace talks and invaded the South on a large scale, we are gathered here, and although our mood is very heavy, when we think of the greatness of the Father of the Nation and the tragic past of countless men of benevolence and lofty ideals, our spirit is still extremely excited and uplifted.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Ying Qin's appointment as President of the Executive Yuan, he adhered to the established policy of Acting President Li and the government to seek peace with the greatest sincerity and tolerance, but due to the Communist Party's insistence on its own way and unreasonable oppression, the peace talks ultimately failed and have entered a new stage of battle. Now, in order to ensure the survival of the nation, the continuation of inherent moral culture, and the maintenance of the free way of life of every citizen, we have no choice but to mobilize all our strength to engage in a decisive struggle with the Communist Party. Ying Qin manages the affairs of the Yuan and also oversees national defense. As long as he is in office, he will do his best with loyalty and dedication.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a notice from your esteemed Yuan, instructing us to report here on the past failure of the peace talks and the future countermeasures regarding diplomacy, military affairs, and economics. Now, we respectfully present a brief report as follows:</p>
<p>The Breakdown of Peace Talks and its Responsibility</p>
<p>Regarding the breakdown of the peace negotiations between the government and the Communist Party, Ying Qin made an oral report to your esteemed Yuan in Nanjing on the afternoon of April 20th. Now, to avoid repeatedly recounting the details, only a few words are added to summarize:</p>
<p>On April 16th, Representative Huang Shaohong flew from Beiping to Nanjing, bringing with him the Communist Party's so-called final revision of the "Domestic Peace Agreement," which was divided into eight articles and twenty-four clauses, limiting the government representatives to sign it before the 20th. The articles listed have been published in the newspapers, so they will not be repeated here. Looking at the content of the agreement, the Communist Party was not talking about peace at all, but completely surrendering. The harshness of the conditions was a hundred or a thousand times worse than the surrender document of Japan to the Allied countries. This fully shows that the Communist Party had no sincerity in peace at all. After receiving this "ultimatum" of forced surrender from the Communist Party, Acting President Li, the presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, and the central military and political leaders in Beijing, including Ying Qin, held consultations for several days. They believed that the basic spirit of the "Agreement" proposed by the Communist Party, and its articles, were contrary to the principles listed in the opinion on the peace issue passed by your esteemed Yuan on March 1st, and the principles of peace talks shown in the administrative policy guidelines reported by Ying Qin to your esteemed Yuan on March 30th, "to establish the peaceful unification of the country, and strive to conduct comprehensive peace negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party under fair and reasonable principles." Therefore, it was decided to telegraph the government's peace negotiation delegation to convey to the Communist Party, stating that it could not accept these forced surrender conditions that violated the interests of the people. The original telegram stated, "Hoping that the Chinese Communist Party will confirm the principle that the interests of the people are higher than everything else, and reconsider the basic spirit and content of this agreement," and also said, "In order to cultivate a peaceful atmosphere, it is hoped that a temporary ceasefire agreement can be established immediately, in order to express the determination and sincerity of both sides to seek genuine peace." This decision and the original telegram to the government's peace negotiation representatives were reported to your esteemed Yuan at 4:00 PM on April 20th, and were approved by your esteemed Yuan. The telegram was sent to Beiping before 11:00 PM on the same day and delivered to the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Since President Chiang issued a proclamation advocating peace on New Year's Day this year, the Communist army has stopped attacking Zhu. After the government's peace negotiation delegation arrived in Ping on April 1st, the offensive of the Communist army on all fronts became even more fierce. The Communist Party set April 20th as the deadline for its final ultimatum, but on the same day, the Communist army crossed the river from the Digang area. At noon on the 21st, Mao Zedong and Zhu De ordered a full-scale general attack on the National Army, which led to the breakdown of the talks. Therefore, Ying Qin wants to solemnly declare to your esteemed Yuan that the breakdown of the peace talks was due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity and its order for a general attack and large-scale crossing of the river. Therefore, the Communist Party should bear full responsibility for the breakdown of the peace talks.</p>
<p>After Mao Zedong and Zhu De ordered the Communist army to cross the river for a general attack on the 21st, Acting President Li and I telegraphed our government's peace negotiation delegation on the 22nd, deciding to send a plane to Beiping to pick up the delegation in Nanjing that day. At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, a special plane took off from Beijing to Ping. Because the airline received a telegram from the company in Beiping saying that the airport was under repair and could not land, the special plane was recalled by radio. On the 24th, I sent a plane from Shanghai to Ping again, carrying a letter from me to Chief Representative Zhang Zhizhong and all representatives, requesting all representatives to take a special plane back to Shanghai that day. On the 25th, the special plane returned to Shanghai, bringing back letters from Representative Zhang and five others. Only then did we learn that our delegation had been detained by the Communist Party and not allowed to return to the South. On the 27th, the Executive Yuan held a meeting in Guangzhou and resolved to revoke the government's peace negotiation delegation and publish the report of Representative Zhang and others in the newspaper. Representative Zhang Zhizhong originally served as the chief military and political officer of the Northwest. Since he was detained and could not return to his post to perform his duties, and the major plans of the Northwest military and political affairs were important and could not be without someone in charge, the Executive Yuan meeting decided on May 4th to dismiss him and appoint Deputy Chief Officer Ji to act as his agent.</p>
<p>Current Military, Economic, and Diplomatic Situation</p>
<p>President He continued to report on the emergency measures taken by the government to move its institutions from Nanjing to Guangzhou after the breakdown of the peace talks, and the various situations of our side after the Communist army crossed the river. He expounded on the current military, economic, and diplomatic situation. Regarding the economic aspect, He declared that the government is working hard to: (1) strive to stabilize the financial situation and gradually stabilize prices; (2) solve the shortage of banknotes in various places; (3) improve the treatment of civil servants and teachers; and (4) improve the method of settling foreign exchange for exports. President He concluded his report by saying that Ying Qin was appointed President of the Executive Yuan at a time of crisis. At the beginning of his term, he originally planned to conduct peace talks with the Communist Party with the greatest sincerity and tolerance, based on fair and reasonable principles, in order to realize the peace and unification of the country and relieve the people from the suffering of being turned upside down. However, the Communist Party had no sincerity at all and always wanted to conquer the entire motherland by force, and be the vanguard of foreign aggression. Therefore, they brazenly ended the peace talks with forced surrender conditions, and at the same time, they crossed the river on a large scale, expanding the war. Ying Qin felt deeply that things did not go as wished, and was extremely ashamed. Now, fortunately, Acting President Li has arrived in Guangzhou, the seat of the government, the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan have also gathered in Guangzhou. There must be wise decisions on the major plans for saving the country and seeking survival. The administrative authorities at all levels follow their own paths, and they can reduce mistakes and work together to achieve success. Today, we are determined to fight the Chinese Communist Party to the end for the independence of the country, the integrity of territorial sovereignty, and the free way of life of the people. As long as we can do the eight characters of "one heart and one mind, gather our strength," and seek reform, seek progress, do not waver, do not yield, the central and local governments will merge into one, and the people and the government will unite as one, the final victory will surely be ours. I said before: "I firmly believe that the final victory will belong to the patriots, not to the traitors, and will belong to the democrats and liberals, not to the violent dictators." Now I still use these words as the conclusion of today's report, and I respectfully ask for your guidance, gentlemen.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 9th] The negotiations on the Sino-Soviet Aviation Treaty have been initiated by the Executive Yuan, since the representative of our Ministry of Communications, Xiao Likun, has not yet arrived in Dihua. The Executive Yuan has appointed four other representatives to begin negotiations with the Soviet representative, Lieutenant General Afseyeviki, and five others. The four representatives from our side are Chief Representative Liu Zerong, Representatives Yimin, Liu Mengchun, and Qu Wu. It is reported that after several consultations between the two sides, it was decided to continue to extend the old treaty signed in 1939 for five years, and not to negotiate a new treaty separately. The representatives of both sides have submitted these opinions to the governments of the two countries for instructions, and are awaiting government instructions. According to the Sino-Soviet Aviation Treaty signed in 1939, it was stipulated that the validity period was ten years, and it will expire in September of this year. The original treaty stated that after the expiration of the validity period, if neither party proposes to abolish it, it will continue to be automatically extended for five years.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Legislators Enthusiastically Inquire; Wang Hansheng Advocates Confiscating Gold and Silver from Wealthy Officials; Pan Yanxing Asks Kong and Song to Take the Lead in Donating <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] The Legislative Yuan held its 18th meeting at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 10th, proceeding in secret. 285 members attended, and President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, accompanied by Huang Shaogu, Ni Jiongcheng, Zhang Zhiben, Liu Gongyun, Ye Gongchao, Li Hanhun, Hang Liwu, Duanmu Jie, Dai Kuisheng, Bai Yunti, Pang Songzhou, Tong Jiling, Zhang Zhihan, and others, attended. Tong Guanxian asked for leave due to business, and Vice President Liu Jianqun chaired the meeting. First, President He of the Executive Yuan was asked to report on the current political, economic, military, and diplomatic situation, which lasted for an hour before it ended (the speech is listed separately). After President He's speech, the whole audience applauded enthusiastically for three minutes. The chairman announced a ten-minute break, and then the meeting continued at 11:15 AM. The members raised questions, the main points of which are as follows: Wang Hansheng said: (1) Supports He's cabinet, but hopes it can be a truly responsible cabinet. (2) Advocates using the gold, silver, and foreign currency stored in the national treasury to stabilize the economy and strengthen combat power. (3) Hopes that President He will use his greatest courage to requisition the gold and silver of wealthy officials and use it as war funds. Officials at all levels should adopt the style of extraordinary times to cope with the current situation. Zhang Daoxing said: (1) The candidate for foreign minister should be considered and appointed as soon as possible. (2) Diplomatic envoys from various countries should move with the government of the country where they are stationed. The fact that diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Beijing did not come to Guangzhou this time is inconsistent with diplomatic practice and should be negotiated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the governments of those countries. (3) Diplomatic style should adapt to the environment and cooperate with national policy. Liu Zhendong said that the price increases of state-owned enterprises without legislative procedures are not good, and hopes that the financial authorities will improve them as soon as possible. Pan Yanxing said: Please ask Kong and Song to take the lead in donating money to mobilize the people to cope with the current situation. Tao Rong said: The treatment of officers and soldiers should be improved. Cai Peihuo advocated that Taiwan should be an anti-communist base, and hopes that the central government will fully support it. Luo Heng proposed: (1) Investigate the responsibility for the rebellion, (2) Rectify those who surrendered, (3) Eliminate reactionary remarks in the rear. By 12:10 PM, some members had not yet had a chance to speak, and they all changed to written inquiries.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] Bai Chongxi flew from Hankou to Guangzhou by plane at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th at the invitation of Acting President Li.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 10th] Commander Bai Chongxi convened a symposium with local elders, leaders from all walks of life, and the press at 10:00 AM on the 10th. Mr. Bai personally presided over the symposium and delivered a speech on the spot. First, he expressed his infinite sorrow for the disappearance of peace and the spread of war, saying that the government was forced to fight, not eager for war. Wuhan is a strategic military location, and the CCP will definitely fight for it. He then announced two points: (1) War in Wuhan is inevitable. In order to reduce unnecessary sacrifices, those who are willing to leave Wuhan can leave immediately. (2) Destructive actions are limited to equipment related to military affairs. Water, electricity, and dikes are definitely not included (referring to external rumors that the military will destroy Zhang Gongdi, Wutai Gate, and Wuhan's water and electricity facilities). It is hoped that people will not easily listen to rumors and disturb each other. After Mr. Bai's speech, Elder Shu Cheng of Hubei Province and Zhang Nanxian successively spoke, saying that after the hope of peace was dashed, the people of Hubei did not talk about partial peace again. We will not be puppets, nor will we hinder the war. Please do not doubt or misunderstand the authorities. When Mr. Zhang spoke, his attitude was angry. He repeatedly questioned the security authorities about the so-called local people colluding with the enemy, which Mr. Bai explained separately. The symposium ended in a heavy atmosphere.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Editorial: Seeking a Turning Point in the Japan Issue <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Four Powers have reached an agreement on the Berlin issue, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference will be held in Paris this month. The long-deadlocked German issue has obviously reached a turning point, and the date for signing the peace treaty with Germany seems to be just around the corner; but what about the Japan issue? Can a turning point be achieved in this Foreign Ministers' Conference? This is the most concerned issue for the countries concerned in Asia. According to a United Press report from Washington on the 6th: "Western diplomats believe that the upcoming Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference will find a turning point in the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. They all believe that the Soviet Union is in a pivotal position for the permanent peace of both Europe and Asia, and the Soviet Union has completed it at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference." This report by the United Press diplomatic reporter is a very close guess. The resolution of the Berlin issue is not only a turning point in opening the German issue, but also a major turning point in world peace: in other words: since the United States and the Soviet Union can compromise on the German issue, they are naturally willing to resolve the Japanese issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>No one can deny that the United States has independently controlled defeated Japan in the name of the Allied Forces for four years without any success, and the price it has paid is very alarming, making the American people feel overwhelmed. In February of this year, American military strategists in Tokyo once strongly advocated the "abandonment of Japan and the withdrawal of the occupying forces." They unanimously believed that Japan was not defensible and was not worth defending; if the US military still remained in Japan in a future war, the United States would have to bear the obligation of supplying food to Japan's 80 million people, which seemed not worth the loss. Although this argument belongs to the US military strategy plan in the Far East, the failure of the US control of Japan is obvious. Furthermore, the attitude of the Allied Forces towards Japan is far less enthusiastic than it used to be. I remember that when the theory of supporting Japan was singing high, MacArthur was happy to agree to any request from Japan, especially in economically assisting Japan, sparing no effort; but in March and April of this year, MacArthur suddenly wanted Japan to be self-reliant, and pointed out an "economic nine principles" for the Yoshida cabinet to earnestly follow. On May 2, MacArthur issued a statement, also saying that "the purpose revealed by the Allied countries at the Potsdam Conference, the main points of which are mostly completed, but the reason why the Allied forces have not withdrawn so far is not Japan's fault, but Japan's inability to control external situations. From now on, the Allied forces' occupation has changed from strict military control to the friendly guidance of the protection force."</p>
<p>MacArthur's statement is tantamount to a confession admitting the failure of controlling Japan. Logically, the United States should have tried to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union long ago, but a traditional wrong concept still dominates the psychology of the US government and the public. Knowing that controlling Japan is not worth the loss, they are unwilling to give up easily. Therefore, MacArthur made three suggestions to the Far East Commission on the 6th of this month: (1) Grant Japan some international relations rights so that it can participate in international society, restore foreign trade, and help its economic recovery and the early withdrawal of the occupying forces. (2) Step up the implementation of land reform to improve the economic situation of tenant farmers. (3) Relax the restrictions on Japan's foreign policy and trade policy so that it can participate in any international conference. We will not ask what MacArthur's motives are for the time being? But before the peace treaty with Japan has been signed, allowing Japan to participate in international society is ultimately an unwise move that violates the Potsdam Declaration. No wonder the representatives of Britain, France, and the Philippines also expressed their opposition. If the United States submits this issue to the Far East Commission for discussion, we believe that the Chinese and Soviet representatives will definitely not agree to this proposal.</p>
<p>We review the US's Japan policy in the past four years, which can be said to be one mistake after another, trapped in the quagmire of mistakes and unable to extricate itself. From the ultimate result of supporting Japan, it is also harmful and useless. This policy of harming others and hurting oneself should have been changed long ago; but the US diplomatic authorities are still obsessed with it, and they are still trying every possible means to raise Japan's military status, trying to gain a helper in future international conferences; but from the perspective of onlookers, everything that the United States has done in Japan is tantamount to burying landmines there, which will inevitably lead to a catastrophe in the Far East once they explode in the future. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the US diplomatic authorities can seize the turning point for world peace given by the resolution of the Berlin issue, and seek a turning point in the Japan issue, so as to open up the long-deadlocked Japanese stalemate. Now is the time for the US government and the public to reconsider their Japan policy. Do not hesitate any longer, mislead yourself and others, and allow the Japan issue to remain in a stalemate for a long time, which will only benefit the former aggressor countries.</p>

<h3 id="e23">At One Minute Past Midnight Tomorrow, Berlin Blockade to be Lifted; Soviet Resumes Partial Power Supply to Western Sectors <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet authorities began lifting the Berlin Blockade on the 10th, forty hours ahead of the final deadline, and have resumed power supply to the western sectors of Berlin. German electricity authorities stated that the restoration of power to the western sectors will be gradual, and full service to pre-blockade levels is expected by the 12th. At one minute past midnight on the 12th (the final deadline for lifting the blockade), the first of the sixteen Allied trains will resume service.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 9th] The Soviet Union and Western powers announced tonight that land and water transport to Berlin and the borders of the Soviet zone will resume at one minute past midnight on the 12th. At that time, Soviet Military Commander in Germany, Chuikov, will broadcast the order to lift the ten-month blockade, resuming transportation, trade, and all kinds of traffic. The Western powers simultaneously announced the lifting of the counter-blockade, allowing the resumption of traffic to the Soviet zone. Chuikov issued an order allowing sixteen freight trains to enter Berlin daily and restoring road traffic, canceling the inspection of Allied personnel baggage and passes. Berlin postal services will also resume simultaneously. At Helmstedt on the British-Soviet border, preparations are underway for the end of the blockade, with workers and soldiers installing wireless and telephone equipment and painting border markers. After the blockade is lifted, the first train to enter Berlin will be a British military passenger train, followed by two other military passenger trains and one ordinary passenger train passing through the border at 6 AM. The first freight train is scheduled to enter the Soviet zone tomorrow and is expected to arrive in Berlin in the evening. The initial plan is to dispatch six coal trains and six freight trains carrying fresh potatoes and daily necessities, followed by sixteen freight trains daily carrying approximately 12,000 tons of supplies, equivalent to the amount airlifted in a 24-hour period during the blockade.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 10th] German officials from the eastern and western sectors of Berlin met in Berlin today to decide when to restore electricity to Berlin to signify the end of the blockade. This is the first meeting between municipal officials from the eastern and western sectors since the division of the Berlin municipal government last November. Meanwhile, the West Berlin municipal government has ordered all shops in the western sectors to close at 3 PM on the 12th, allowing employees to attend a mass rally in the American sector. The Soviet-backed communists will also hold a rally in East Berlin at the same time. Furthermore, since the beginning of the Allied airlift to Berlin, a total of 1.22 million tons of goods have been transported to Berlin by midnight on the 11th.</p>

<p>[Reuters Belgrade, 9th] The Yugoslav News Agency reported that on Monday night, Albanian soldiers armed with submachine guns fired on Yugoslav soldiers in a motorboat on Lake Skadar for two and a half hours. These Yugoslavs were starting a relay race from there to Belgrade to commemorate Premier Tito's birthday. Under a hail of bullets, one Yugoslav soldier risked swimming ashore, another was seriously injured, and one was slightly injured. The motorboat was riddled with bullets and rendered inoperable. The Albanian sentries continued firing for another two hours. Half an hour later, Albanian soldiers towed the boat to the Albanian side of the border. The Yugoslav authorities only managed to establish contact with the Albanian authorities at 6 PM, agreeing to form a joint committee to investigate the incident, but the Albanian side insisted that the meeting could not be held until the next day. The next day at noon, when the Albanian representatives arrived, they stated that they were under orders from the government not to proceed with the investigation, and they brandished their weapons to threaten the Yugoslav representatives. The Yugoslav embassy in Albania has lodged a strong protest with the Albanian government, demanding the return of the boat and its personnel.</p>

<h3 id="e50">The Whole Story of the Karen Rebellion in Burma <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Siren</p>
<p>The Karen are considered the second largest ethnic group among the various ethnic groups in Burma (the largest being the Burmese). Their total population, according to pre-war statistics, was 1,341,066, accounting for one-tenth of the total population of Burma. They are mostly scattered in the delta of Lower Burma and along the Salween River in southern Burma. According to the research of British scholar Stevenson, the Karen originally belonged to the Thai-Chinese ethnic group and migrated into Burma from a part of Yunnan Province in China, residing in the Donggua mountainous area of Upper Burma. Later, a part of them moved to Bassein in the delta and the southern part of the Arakan Mountains in the northwest. Initially, they were afraid of the Burmese and dared not migrate to Burmese areas. It was not until the British ruled Burma and after many years of peace that they dared to slowly move to the plains of the Irrawaddy River, the delta, and the Tenasserim region. The Karen are loyal and simple, but lack creativity. Within the Karen, there are Red Karen. The Red Karen are further divided into Black Karen and Striped Karen. The total population of the Red, Black, and Striped Karen is about 200,000, mostly scattered in the mountains around Donggua. The "mountain friends" mentioned in Campbell's letter refer to these Red Karen.</p>
<p>The Karen originally had no written language or historical records. Initially, they only had natural traditions passed down from generation to generation. It was not until after the First Anglo-Burmese War that British and American missionaries invented a writing system for them, but it was mostly based on the Burmese script. The alphabet consists of 25 consonants and 7 vowels. Because they live with many Burmese, most of them understand Burmese language and customs are not very different from the Burmese, except that the Karen are Christians, while the Burmese are Buddhists. This is largely due to British influence. Because Karen culture was brought by the British, most Karen people have received secondary English education. In the past, when the British ruled Burma, every Karen area had church-run English schools, so Karen men and women had the opportunity to receive a British education.</p>
<p>It is precisely because of these educational and religious ties that the Karen are mostly pro-British. It is also because of this relationship that during the British rule of Burma, many local administrative officials were Karen, and the Burmese National Army was also based on Karen. They followed the British intentions and carried out the work of the rulers, which was deeply resented by the Burmese. However, during the British rule, there were no major hostile incidents. It was not until the Japanese occupied Burma that, due to the Japanese instigation, a tragic massacre occurred, with more than 10,000 deaths on both sides. This planted the seeds of hatred between the two ethnic groups, leading to the ethnic war tragedy that has now occurred.</p>
<p>Regarding this Karen-Burmese ethnic war, the reporter believes that the most worrying thing is that it will plant even deeper roots of hatred. Because once the war starts, the administrative officials in the war zone retreat to the rear, and the Burmese army lacks political departments, allowing the army to run amok, which often leads to things going awry. For example, one day when the reporter went to the war zone to cover the news, a Burmese soldier asked the reporter if he wanted to see Karen corpses. The reporter asked how they were killed. He said that yesterday when they attacked a Karen village, they caught six Karen people in the village and took them to the river and killed them. Naturally, whether those six Karen were insurgents is still questionable. The Burmese army's summary execution of them will only make the Karen hate the Burmese even more.</p>
<p>Cycle of Retribution</p>
<p>Another Burmese officer told the reporter a tragic story, but the Burmese officer told the story triumphantly. He said: "Once we captured a Karen village, and all the Karen people in the village had fled. But in the kitchen of a rather exquisite Karen house, we found a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen. Maybe she didn't have time to escape. When she saw us, she was very panicked and claimed that she was Burmese, saying that as long as we didn't kill her, we could do whatever we wanted. We said: We don't want you. Your Karen men are disrupting our discipline, and we want revenge. Later, we told her that we would take you to the monks to be dealt with. Because the monks advocated killing, we killed her." As he said this, he made a gesture of beheading and explained how the girl's head fell. Since the outbreak of the war, news of the two ethnic groups' armies raping women of the opposing ethnic group and killing civilians of the opposing ethnic group has been heard from time to time. In addition, the Burmese army has adopted a scorched-earth policy, burning down all Karen villages, regardless of whether they have insurgents or not. In retaliation, the Karen army also adopted the same tactics against the Burmese whenever they captured Burmese areas. The reporter once visited a Burmese family whose house had been burned down. He said angrily: "All my family's livelihood depended on this. These sons of bitches (referring to the Karen who burned his house) were so heartless as to burn everything I had. I will live here forever, and there will be a day when we meet!" All such things are enough to deepen the hatred between the two ethnic groups. If the roots of this poisonous bacteria are not quickly pulled out, even if this war is resolved peacefully, a second war will inevitably occur in the future.</p>
<p>Source of Weapons</p>
<p>The source of the weapons used by the Karen in this rebellion is roughly from the following aspects: (1) Left over from the Japanese army. After the Japanese army retreated from northern and central Burma, all their forces were concentrated in southern Burma, facing the Allied forces across the Sittang River. Later, Japan surrendered in Burma, and the Japanese army in southern Burma also automatically disarmed. Of the more than 300,000 Japanese troops in Burma, most of the weapons surrendered, except for a part received by the British army, fell into the hands of the Karen. (2) When the Allied forces counterattacked Burma, in February 1945, Colonel Blaire led the 136th Regiment to land in the Karen area to organize the Karen guerrillas. After the war, most of these guerrillas were formed into the Burmese National Army. After Burma's independence, perhaps the British intentionally left poison, these National Army soldiers were ostensibly disbanded, but secretly they were reorganized into smaller units, and the weapons naturally remained. In addition to these two channels, as mentioned above, the Burmese government believes that the British secretly provided the Karen with weapons.</p>
<p>The Crux of the Problem</p>
<p>The reason why this Karen-Burmese conflict is so difficult to resolve is that the Karen insist on establishing their own state with autonomy, but the government believes that it has serious vested interests and cannot grant their request. The Burmese government's reason is that in some of the areas that the Karen are demanding to be劃分delineated, Karen residents only account for 30%, and in some places only 19%. There is no possibility of establishing another ethnic nation at all, and there are also economic problems. Speaking fairly from a third-party perspective, the Karen have the right to demand autonomy, but the demands they have made are a bit excessive, because the areas that the Karen are demanding to be delineated are all rich areas. To speak frankly for the Burmese government, it is: "You want all the good things, what do I have left?" However, the vested interests are not limited to this. The most important thing is the port issue. The areas that the Karen are demanding to be delineated, such as Bassein and Tavoy, are all ports where ocean-going vessels can dock. If the government allows the Karen to establish a state in these places, with the Karen's past relationship with Britain as a springboard for a comeback, they will inevitably use the Karen area as a breeding ground for economic aggression. Therefore, if the Burmese government allows the Karen to establish a state, it is tantamount to digging a hole in its own pocket. Therefore, the Burmese government insists that it cannot agree to the Karen's demand for statehood.</p>
<p>Future Prospects</p>
<p>The Karen-Burmese conflict and vested interests have been described above, so this incident is indeed a very difficult problem to solve. On March 1, the Indian government convened an informal meeting of the British Commonwealth countries in Southeast Asia in India to discuss ways to mediate the Karen-Burmese conflict. As a result of the discussion, the participating countries (including India, Pakistan, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Ceylon) jointly sent a letter to Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu, requesting mediation of the Karen-Burmese conflict, but the Burmese government has not yet responded. If this conflict cannot be resolved peacefully, the Karen already possess the areas and weapons mentioned above, and most of the Karen youth have military knowledge, and they are united and brave. Then Burma's future destiny will encounter even greater misfortunes, which is to be expected. (End of full text)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Shantou Team to Battle Maoxun Today for Top Eight Spots; Kang Team and Pang Team to Face Huanan and Chongde Respectively <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The knockout stage of the Group Two Basketball League playoffs begins today. There will be three games starting at 5:00 PM, still held at the Municipal Gymnasium. Admission is free. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Pang Team — Chongde (Group Three) 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Kang Team — Huanan (Group Two) 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Shantou Team — Maoxun (Group One) 7:00 PM</p>
<p>In the first game, Pang Team from Group Three will face Chongde. Pang Team was fifth in Section C, while Chongde was fourth in Section D. The former defeated Jianle Iron Union in the sectional matches, so their fighting strength is still acceptable. The latter has not won a single victory since the start of the season. When the two teams meet, Pang Team has a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>Next, Kang Team from Group Two will compete with Huanan. This group consists of the third and fourth-place teams from each section. Kang Team was originally from Section A, while Huanan was from Section B. Led by veteran Lu Dazhen, Kang Team has many young players such as Tong Tingxuan, Wang Chang'an, Rong Chengen, and Zhou Lang, who have plenty of stamina. Huanan's He Hanfu, Huang Tianlie, and Li Xianzheng are also veterans of the arena. The two teams will surely put on a fierce battle.</p>
<p>The final game is between Shantou Team, the champion of Section D, and Maoxun, the runner-up of Section A. Supported by Chen Qingjiang, Luo Shaoqiong, and Zheng Guofan, Shantou Team still maintains its fast-paced style. They defeated Chenyou, Pushui, Chongde, and Red Cavalry in Section D to win the championship. Now, in order to compete for a spot in the top eight, they will go all out. Maoxun is a top team in Section A. Players such as Sun Jiafei, Liu Zhaoren, Zhuo Guanren, and Yang Jizhen have excellent records. Facing a strong enemy, they will be cautious. The battle on the court will surely be exciting.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Table Tennis League Group A: Huamei Scores Two Victories, Passing Five Hurdles <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Hualian to Face Youyi in Today's Group A Match</p>
<p>In the fourth Table Tennis League, Group A's Huamei played against Youyi and Youwu Brothers the day before yesterday at the Youwu Gymnasium. More than 400 spectators attended, and the court was packed. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. Huamei is strong, and victory was expected, but the two main players did not perform up to par. For example, Xue Xuchu, who is skilled in long rallies and short pushes, was flustered in his shots. In the first match against Youyi veteran Yu Chunrong, Yu used close blocks to counterattack, putting Xuchu in a difficult battle. In the second game, the two even tied at 25 all. Xue finally won by a single point. In the next match, Xuchu played against young player Wang Chuanyao, but he still played abnormally. Chuanyao fought hard and did not retreat. Both games were lost after leading. If he could have been more composed, he would have had a good chance of winning. The audience said that Xuchu was lucky to escape unscathed. In another match, veteran Lu Hanjun tried his best in the first game against Youwu's Liu Zaoshi, but he was defeated 1-2. Fortunately, Qin Duyan in the second group defeated Jiang Chunshan, a topspin player, allowing them to overcome the danger. Overall, Huamei's fighting strength was affected by the absence of Li Zongpei and Fu Qifang. If Xue and Lu make any more mistakes, there may be changes in future matches against the four strong teams: Jingwu Lianxing, Hualian, and Quanlu. Youyi's Zhu Qingji defeated Huamei's young player Xue Weichu, breaking the zero-point record. Youwu resisted calmly. Although they lost 2-3, they can be said to have lost with honor. As a result, Huamei had a double victory, maintaining a record of five wins and five losses. The records of the two games are as follows:</p>
<p>(Huamei) Score (Youyi)</p>
<p>Wang Jiuqing 2—0 Shen Airen</p>
<p>Lu Hanjun 2—0 Zhu Zhongsun</p>
<p>Xue Weichu 0—2 Zhu Qingji</p>
<p>Xue Xuchu 2—0 Yu Chunrong</p>
<p>Han De 2—1 Dai Yongquan</p>
<p>(Huamei) Score (Youwu)</p>
<p>Lu Hanjun 1—2 Liu Zaoshi</p>
<p>Qin Duyan 2—0 Jiang Chunshan</p>
<p>Xue Xuchu 2—0 Wang Chuanyao</p>
<p>Wang Jiuqing 2—0 Yang Peitian</p>
<p>Han De 1—2 Zhuang Kunrong</p>
<p>Today (11th), there will be another Group A match and three Group B matches. In Group A, Hualian will face Youyi at the Guohuo Gymnasium. Hualian has won both of its previous matches, but the strong topspin player Deng Xiurong has not yet participated, which has affected their strength. The rest of the players, such as Zhang Zhihong, Lu Wenliang, and Li Zhen, are all veterans. Although their sharpness has diminished slightly, they have clear minds and are extremely experienced in battle. Youyi also has many veterans, but the whole team lacks top-notch attacking talent, which puts them at a disadvantage. In today's match against Hualian, they will fight with all their might. The schedule for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Hualian — Youyi (Group A) 7:00 PM Guohuo</p>
<p>Fansheng — Zhongnong (Group B2) 7:00 PM Zhongnong</p>
<p>Meiya — You San (Group B3) 7:00 PM Youwu</p>
<p>Nongji Yi — Xinyi (Group B2) 7:00 PM Xinyi</p>
<h3 id="e53">Huili Team Protests the Referees Association <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Huili Basketball Team issued the following statement regarding the refereeing incident: "To the sports sections of major newspapers in the city: We were surprised to read the news of the Shanghai Basketball Referees Association's decision in your sports columns on the 8th of this month, especially the item concerning our team. On May 4th, during the Mayor's Cup single round-robin tournament, our team played against Renyu. Chen Baolin and Xuan He were the referees. Five minutes before the end of the game, because Chen Baolin made several incorrect judgments, it stimulated the dissatisfaction of our team member Cao Zhiji. While passing the ball, he threw the basketball at the referee, resulting in his expulsion from the game. At that time, our team leader not only absolutely obeyed the referee's decision, but also tried to restrain the emotions of the players to avoid any accidents. Unexpectedly, the referee not only did not reflect on his poor skills, which led to the dispute, but also submitted a letter to the Referees Association asking the Basketball Committee to punish our team members Cao Zhiji and Tian Fuhai. (Tian Fuhai was deemed disrespectful for applauding the referee, but the referee did not express any objection at the time.) The most absurd thing is that the Referees Association threatened to stop sending referees to any of our team's games until the Cao and Tian incident is resolved. The Basketball Committee is interfering with the freedom of others and dare to abuse the authority of the Referees Association, forcibly suspending all sports activities of our team, destroying sports. Nothing could be worse. Our team was established less than a year ago, and our aim is to promote amateur sports and do our best. Unexpectedly, because of the misconduct of one or two team members, the entire team has been oppressed by the Referees Association. We are truly disheartened by the future of Shanghai sports. In addition to awaiting the decision of the Basketball Committee, we express our firm protest against the Referees Association's previous measures and appeal to all friendly teams and sports figures in the city to make a fair judgment."</p>
<h3 id="e54">British Writer Researches That Football Originated in China <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 10th] According to an article "The Focus of Professional Football Games" written by Crickshank for the British Broadcasting Corporation, China is the originator of football. Crickshank said: The game of football did not originate in Scotland as commonly believed. As early as 2,400 years ago, China already had the game of football, and it was part of military training. He explained that what the Chinese played at that time was not the football that is popular in Britain today, but a football made of eight pieces of leather sewn together with hair inside, which was later changed to air. He also made a diagram comparing the football that was originally played in China with the football that is popular in Britain today, saying that in ancient China, on the emperor's birthday, two teams would compete in football in front of the palace, and the winner would receive prizes such as flowers, fruits, wine, and silver cups.</p>

According to the relevant authorities, regardless of whether the vehicles are out of service, all vehicles that have been licensed must still pay the special tax.

<h3 id="e67">Newsdom Continues Publication <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The publishing industry has recently been affected by the current situation, and almost all of it has fallen into a state of stagnation. "Newsdom," which has been published for more than four years, is now continuing to publish (changed to a bi-monthly publication). Key topics in this issue include "Shanghai Under the Judgment of the God of War," "Shanghai in May," "Li Zongren and His Clique," "TV Soong's Political Trip," and "The Unending War," etc. All major bookstores and newsstands in the city are selling it.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Summer in the City: Huangpu River Night Cruises Likely Unrecoverable; Pessimistic Outlook for Cold Drink Production and Sales <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Only a few days have passed since the start of summer according to the lunar calendar, and summer scenes are already visible everywhere in the city. The highest temperatures yesterday and the day before both reached over 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and it felt particularly hot at noon. In recent days, the number of visitors to large and small parks in the city has increased significantly, and the closing time of each park has been extended to after 8:00 PM in the evening. The summer Huangpu River night cruises, formerly organized by the city's ferry company, will not be able to resume this year due to restrictions from martial law. However, many public and private swimming pools in the city are currently being repaired and renovated, and it is heard that they will be opened in the short term.</p>
<p>The ice blocks most needed in the summer will likely still largely depend on the artificial ice from the Pudong area this year. The machine-made ice industry is under too heavy a burden from electricity costs and labor costs, and the price of raw materials such as ammonia is extremely high, so it is difficult to be optimistic about the output. As for the air-conditioning equipment that must be installed in all cinemas and dance halls every summer, according to these two industries, the installation this year will depend on how the business situation is. The entertainment industry is usually in a "slack season" in the summer, and it is expected that the seats will be dismal this year, even more so than in previous years. If this is the case, then even if the air-conditioning equipment is installed as usual, its opening will definitely be delayed until the extreme heat of midsummer.</p>
<p>A large number of cold drinks are already on the market. In terms of the purchasing power of the general public, their prices cannot be said to be low. For example, a large ice block sells for 3.2 million yuan, a paper cup of ice cream sells for 600,000 yuan, Coca-Cola and soda cost 500,000 yuan per bottle, and a popsicle costs 120,000 yuan per stick. According to the average statistics of larger sales stores in recent days, apart from popsicles and soda, other actual sales have failed to reach the ideal records of early summer last year.</p>

<p>In the past, the municipal government established a Security Donation Committee to supply non-staple food for military police and to cover emergency expenses when necessary. Starting from March of this year, the Security Donation Committee was designated to collect security donations from various trade associations, and a set of Shanghai Local Security Donation Collection Methods was promulgated as a basis. It is learned that now, due to changes in the situation, the original method is no longer fully applicable. The municipal government has ordered the abolition of the aforementioned method, and the collection will be suspended starting today (the 11th). As for alternative methods, the municipal government is currently consulting with relevant parties to properly formulate them.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At approximately 9:40 PM the night before last, four thieves broke into the Xintai Tobacco Store at No. 843 Changshou Road. Two were wearing turned-over shirts and trousers, and two were wearing black Zhongshan suits. They entered the store under the pretext of buying cigarettes, took out guns to intimidate the staff, and carried out a search and robbery. At that time, two uniformed police officers from the Changshou Road Police Station happened to pass by and caught sight of it. They immediately reported it to the Jiangning Road Police Branch in charge via telephone. Chief Li personally led a number of police officers to rush to arrest them. Who knew that the thieves had already fled towards the back door? Later, the Flying Fortress also heard the news and dispatched, arriving to find a small river outside the back door of the tobacco store. It was observed that there were faint footprints on the other side, so they followed the traces and pursued them. They searched inside until they reached a certain tanning workshop, but there were a large number of people in the workshop, so it was impossible to find them at once. The branch is continuing to investigate where the four thieves went.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Youth Front Visiting Team Returns to Shanghai to Host Reporters; Waiting for an Opportunity to Prepare for a Decisive Battle Based on Observations Along the Way <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Youth Front Visiting Team, organized by students from universities and colleges in this city, returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing its mission on the 9th, having departed on the 6th of this month to visit various front-line areas. Zhang Danqiu and Zhang Gangjian, the persons in charge of the team, held a special reception for reporters at the Shanghai Club yesterday to report on the team's journey and the situation on the front line, saying: The entire team consisted of 130 people, divided into five district teams, with 25 to 30 people in each team. The locations visited this time were Kunshan, Lujiabang, and Nanxiang for the first district team; Taicang for the second district team; Jiaxing for the third district team; Songjiang and Huangdu for the fourth district team; and Chongming for the fifth district team. The observations made along the way can be summarized into several points:</p>
<p>All Circles Extend Their Sympathies, Hoping to Change to Physical Goods</p>
<p>(1) The morale of the National Army soldiers is extremely high, and their understanding of the combat goals is particularly clear. They all believe that the retreat from Jiangnan was not a defeat and feel infinitely saddened and indignant. (2) At present, the National Army on the front line lacks daily necessities, medical personnel, and spiritual food. It is hoped that the people in the rear can deeply understand this point and regularly provide assistance and support. They expressed that they especially welcome all circles to actually come to the front line for inspection, so as to communicate with each other. (3) The treatment of the National Army soldiers still needs to be improved quickly. Last month, each person actually received only the equivalent of about one silver yuan, which is often not enough even for postage. In addition, there is a severe shortage of daily necessities in various front-line areas, and it is impossible to add purchases of shoes, socks, shirts, and trousers, etc. Therefore, they hope that in the future, if various circles issue consolation money, it can be changed to practical items of the same value, without the need to issue silver dollars again. (4) They hope that their families can be properly taken care of and settled by the authorities so that they can concentrate on fighting.</p>
<p>Fishing by the River, Relaxed and Content</p>
<p>As for the general situation in various front-line areas at present, according to Zhang et al.'s report, the local administrative agencies in Kunshan and other counties have been evacuated, and the affairs of the administration are now concurrently managed by the heads of the stationed troops. Prices are generally lower than in Shanghai. One silver yuan can buy twelve catties of pork. The villages farther away from the front line are unusually quiet. Among the crowing of chickens and barking of dogs, soldiers mostly spend their time fishing by the river, appearing extremely relaxed. At present, the soldiers in various units are mostly people from the Subei Luyuan area or those who volunteered to join the army. They hope to be able to fight back to their hometowns as soon as possible, so they are all eagerly preparing to wait for the opportunity to seek a decisive battle with the main force of the Communist army. They deeply believe that this battle will be like the Battle of Zhuxian Town in the Song Dynasty, stabilizing Jiangnan with one battle, so that patriots in the occupied areas will also rise up in response to each other.</p>
<p>After returning to Shanghai this time, it is heard that the team will contact various industrial and commercial circles in this city and collect practical consolation goods, and will go to the front line again next week for in-depth visits. Representatives from the press will also be invited to participate at that time.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Songhu Garrison Command recently approved a public letter from the Food Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee stating: In order to supply urban food distribution sources, a part of the committee is entrusted to merchants to contract or purchase spot bills of lading. Recently, the situation has been tense, and unscrupulous merchants have taken advantage of the opportunity, intending to wait and see, delaying delivery or failing to respond to the offer, directly attempting to defraud public funds and indirectly endangering the people's food and affecting social order. The cunning means of such unscrupulous merchants cannot be punished by ordinary legal procedures. This committee is responsible for maintaining the distribution of food for the people and cannot allow them to evade responsibility for a long time, affecting the committee's estimated food sources. Therefore, it is specifically requested to investigate. In the future, this committee plans to send all such unscrupulous merchants to your department for strict arrest and pursuit in accordance with the regulations on the governance of endangering the people's food within the martial law decree, in order to protect public funds and maintain the people's food, etc. After receiving the request, the Garrison Command immediately instructed the enforcement team of the department, the 9th Regiment of the Military Police, and the Municipal Police Department to earnestly assist in urging the handling of the matter at any time.

<h3 id="e80">The Gold Market Wants to Rise but Lacks Strength; Silver Ornaments Resume Listing Yesterday <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's gold market situation was such that because the authorities exerted heavy pressure, people were exhausted and unable to rise. Large investors did not dare to act rashly, and the market momentum wanted to rise but lacked strength. The off-site market opened at 200 million, 230 million in the morning, and rose to 210 million, 240 million. General manufacturers frequently came out, moving in small increments to 160 million, 190 million. The midday close recovered slightly to 200 million, 230 million. In the afternoon, those who did so were the same, and transactions were sluggish. It was still shouted at 200 million, 230 million, and finally fell to 190 million, 220 million. Some people sold, which was not much of an honor or disgrace compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The off-site supply of US dollars was more than demand, and it also plummeted. It opened at 4 million, 4.5 million at the highest, rose to 4.2 million, 4.7 million, fell to 3.5 million, 4 million, and the midday close was slightly higher at 3.7 million, 4.2 million. There were few transactions in the afternoon. It was once shouted up to 3.8 million, 4.3 million, and then fell again to 3.8 million, 4.3 million, and then fell again to 3.7 million, 4.2 million. In the end, it fell another 100,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold ornaments in silver shops went through many twists and turns. It was stable in the morning, initially listed at 190 million, 230 million, and briefly fell to 180 million, 220 million near noon. In the afternoon, it rose again to 190 million, 230 million, which was not much different from the previous day. Silver ornaments also resumed listing, with 2 million in and 2.6 million out. For old gold exchanged for new gold, there was a loss of 8 million per tael. The money exchange industry has also resumed trading, with the opening yesterday at 180 million in and 220 million out, and transactions were still strong.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Report] After the pricing index of public utilities rose wildly day by day, manufacturers and citizens alike could not bear the burden and unanimously opposed it. After the Public Utilities Group of the Municipal Council responded to the public's demands and held a meeting a few days ago, it was resolved to cancel the pricing index of public utilities. Water and electricity fees for last month will be temporarily paid according to the wage index of over 370,000 times. However, the public utilities companies in this city did not accept this resolution, and still stipulated that fees should be paid according to the public utility pricing index of 790,000 times, which made ordinary citizens feel that they could not afford it, and they were afraid of power outages and water cuts, were perplexed and in pain, and could not help themselves. All hope that the municipal authorities will quickly formulate a method, maintain the purpose of protecting public utilities, and strive to reduce the burden on citizens.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Social Affairs Bureau began issuing silver dollar purchase and sale permits, it has been reported that accountant Jiao Dingkai and another accountant surnamed Wang are suspected of handling silver dollar trading registration for sellers. After investigation, it was found that there were more than 100 blank application forms. The bureau then detained and investigated the two accountants, Jiao and Wang. Subsequently, Jiao Kai was allowed to post bail, and the accountant surnamed Wang was sent to the Garrison Command for handling because of more serious suspicion.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Silver Dollar Trading is Sluggish; Only Miscellaneous Brands are Being Traded <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] There was no change in silver dollars yesterday. The general listing was still 3.8 million in and 4 million out, with Eagle Dollars, Dragon Dollars, and Sichuan Dollars being traded. Large investors did not show their faces. The price of gold and silver exchange was chaotic, with the high being 48 yuan in and 53 yuan out, and the low being 43 yuan in and 48 yuan out. The average was between 45 yuan and 50 yuan. The exchange of paper money for silver was still the original price of 8.5 yuan in and 9.5 yuan out, regardless of the version, but there were also those who exchanged at 8.2 yuan in and 8.7 yuan out. The price of gold ornaments on the street in exchange for silver dollars was as high as 44 yuan and 49 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The nickel coin market remained weak, mainly because transactions were scarce and there were few foreign customers absorbing them. Street vendors were also sparse. Twenty-cent coins fell to 210,000, 170,000, and ten-cent coins retreated to 60,000, 80,000. Five-cent coins were in short supply and sales were sluggish, shouted at 20,000, 40,000, down another 10,000 to 20,000 from the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Rice Prices Rise Again <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Although the actual sales of rice are not smooth, the prices have risen again because the arrival of goods is extremely small and there are few fake products in the market. The market management committee has once again strictly stipulated that transactions must be priced in gold yuan, and each commodity must exceed 30 million. White japonica rice in the Nanshi market was 34 million yuan, and thin indica rice was 34.8 million, both up more than 4 million. White japonica and thin indica rice in the Beishi market were both 31 million yuan, but transactions were very sluggish. 135 dan of goods arrived in the Nanshi market yesterday.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Due to the decline in silver dollars, they also fell in line. Yellow soybeans had few outlets, and Jiujiang winter soybeans fell to 12 million, a decrease of 3 million per dan. Picked green beans fell by 6 million, and corn also saw a decline. Yangzhou raw oil opened at 30.8 million, and Jiujiang sesame opened at 20 million. Each commodity opened slightly.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Returned to a downward trend, because gold, paper money, and silver dollars all declined. Holders took profits when prices were high, and the market was oversupplied. Prices generally fell. Bingchuan opened at 720,000 in the morning, once falling to 690,000, and scattered investors slightly absorbed at the close, rising back to 710,000. Lao Che retreated to 7.51 million. Bran has not yet opened.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The rising trend intensified, the market supply was very scarce, and transactions were few. Holders supported the price even more. Factory soybean oil surged by more than 20%, reaching a peak of 100 million yuan. Raw oil was in short supply and most popular, surging by more than 30%. The factory opening price exceeded the 100 million yuan mark. Raw and cooked rapeseed oil each rose by about 10%. Soybean cake did not open.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Cotton Yarn Prices Fall Across the Board; Fabric Market Sales Are Not Lonely <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Cotton yarn prices fell across the board yesterday due to sluggish actual sales and depressed sentiment. The off-site gold market situation was ordinary, and each gang had more selling than buying. There were only shouted prices in the market without any transactions. 42s Blue Phoenix was shouted at 760 million, down another 60 million. 40s Blue Phoenix was shouted at 740 million, also down 60 million. 32s Silver Moon was 570 million, and 21s Double Horse spot was shouted at 510 million, with the warehouse receipt at 460 million. Prices for 20s and below fell across the board.</p>
<p>Fine fabrics were selling well in the cotton fabric market. Affected by gangs of single buyers from various places bringing goods, sporadic sales were still not lonely. After the counter gang opened, they absorbed a lot. At 9:15, when shouting prices were made, the market was full of buying voices, and the prices rose all the way. The leading fine fabric rose from 17.8 million to a high price of 18.6 million. Wufu fine fabric initially made 15.2 million, and then shouted up 1 million yuan. The industry searched for low-end fine fabrics. Da Shuanglong fine fabric rose steadily from 14.8 million to 15.6 million, and San Tao fine fabric actually made a high price of 15.8 million. Umbrella bleached fabric was squeezed up to 3.6 million. As for Four Gentlemen Serge, because the market was dry and the holders were particularly keen to sell, the opening price was the lowest at 18 million, and then it rose straight to a high price of 19.6 million. Near the close, due to profit-taking, there was a slight pullback. The midday close for Longtou fine fabric was 18.2 million, up 1.2 million. Four Gentlemen Serge was 19 million, up 1.6 million. Wufu Longtou fine fabric was 16 million, and Laba Tong was 16.4 million, with low-priced goods rising more.</p>

<p>Yesterday's rayon market situation was cold and weak, because the China Trust Bureau's allotment was repeated, the supply source was relatively abundant, and people's hearts were softened. The off-site gold price continued to weaken, and silk fabric sales were non-existent. The reduction in the main street was particularly weak. The market situation was weak after the opening. The morning opening price of 120 count bright new goods for spot delivery was 510 million, falling all the way to 480 million. In the afternoon, the trend of silver funds was still loose, but the appetite of all parties was still weak, and the market could not be boosted. Shouting prices continued to fall back, but there were no transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Viewing Guilin's Landscape in a Chaotic World <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming</p>
<p>[Guilin, 2nd Day] Spring arrives late in the Lingnan region. Coupled with the incessant rain of the past month, the Solitary Beauty Peak is always shrouded in silvery mist. There hasn't been any sun here for a long time, and people are still wearing coats. Friends who have just returned from Guangzhou bring news that people by the sea are already experiencing high summer, which is bound to make those hibernating in winter envious! Fortunately, the first spring thunder resounded a few nights ago, bringing spring to Guilin from the darkness. Many people who have been tormented by life breathe a sigh of relief and shout: "Winter is over, isn't spring here?"</p>
<p>These days, Guilin is filled with the breath of spring. The footsteps of spring come in great strides - in the cheers of children, in the smiles of old farmers, and in the enthusiastic anticipation of many more people.</p>
<p>From the shores of the lake, Crescent Moon Mountain, and along the Peach Blossom River, pairs of young students can't contain the boundless spring, humming those alluring sentences: "Spring brings us intoxicating warm winds, blowing flower-like dreams..."</p>
<p>Guilin, enjoying the reputation of "the finest landscape under heaven" for over a thousand years, how could it not arouse the yearning of more people at this time? I once explained to a friend the "lovable aspects of Guilin's landscape" - a similar difficult question. The reason is: "The landscape here is lovable not because of its shape, but because of its color. I don't think any landscape is magnificent or uniquely exquisite, but it is those things wrapped in her, hidden under a thin quilt, those faint, cool, and vibrantly green new clothes."</p>
<p>Friends who know how to enjoy "Guilin's landscape" don't choose sunny days, but prefer to select times of misty rain. Only by viewing Guilin's landscape in the rain can one truly gain the "secret of unique enjoyment."</p>
<p>Recently, although the "annoying" rain has been drizzling intermittently, those with refined tastes still seek out the mountains and waters as usual. Their discoveries are "not for the common man to know." At this time, climbing high into an open pavilion, what greets you is a mountain mist and rain, a river of empty emerald. Who would still think of war? Think of slaughter? Originally, green is somewhat symbolic of peace, just as white symbolizes purity, yellow symbolizes decline, and red symbolizes enthusiasm. Looking at green, people naturally think of fertile fields and quiet villages, and can completely entrust a pure heart to that boundless green shadow.</p>
<p>Before the war, most of the mountains surrounding Guilin city could not be climbed for distant views. During the war, many mountain roads were opened up due to military needs. Today - after the war, it has become much more convenient for many "refined people." Like Elephant Trunk Hill, this "southern China barrier," one can now easily climb the steps to the top. At the same time, it is closest to the city and the road is wide, so it attracts the most tourists. Those who enjoy Elephant Trunk Hill are best advised to go down along the elephant's neck and nose. If you are brave enough, you might as well lower yourself to the river beach, walking barefoot on the exposed small black stones, with moss stains dyeing your toes, which is of course a different kind of fresh taste. And if you take a small boat, the cold, green river water seeps into your sleeves, a sound of oars, a sound of sandbars, whistling past. If accompanied by the rain peaks and the Xiao flute's rain melody, the feeling at this time, the misty rain of Purple Continent, is truly worth experiencing.</p>
<p>Despite the beacon fires raging in the northern sky and prices soaring, those "seeking spring" don't care about the strike of the Zhou-Gui-Qian Railway and the Western University's tuition. Many are taking advantage of the spring tide and going on outings in the suburbs. However, the pity is: no one thinks of using the carrying pole of a wonton vendor to sit, in that fresh yellow rape flower field, guessing with dice while warming wine, only leaving Shen Sanbai and Chen Yunniang to be beautiful in the past. It can be seen that modern people are still much more vulgar than the refined people of the past. Those men and women dressed in red and green, side by side, whispering and muttering, who knows if they are really seeking spring? Or do they have another "intention, like the old drunkard"?</p>
<p>After Qingming, a friend went to sweep tombs and sought an oracle at the "Longevity Buddha" on Crescent Moon Mountain for "profit," randomly drawing a "peace slip," which said well: "Enemies seeking revenge, tolerance will naturally cease, tolerate and there will be no trouble, fighting brings worry."</p>
<p>Don't imitate the predecessors like this: "The beauty of spring is hard to resist, the wine cup is often shallow, and new and old hatreds intertwine, the wind at the fifth watch, a thousand miles of dreams, seeing a few petals of flying red, such a courtyard..." In the courtyard, it is ultimately inevitable to collect sighs from now on. Quite a few people are living through hardships, they have forgotten spring. Spring has left people - it is very, very far from that many unfortunate people...</p>
<h3 id="e90">The City of Import Surplus: Fuzhou <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Ping</p>
<p>[Fuzhou, 26th Day] Many soldiers have appeared on the streets of Fuzhou, and ten-wheeled military trucks are speeding through the narrow streets of Fuzhou, occasionally swallowing up pedestrians and rickshaws. Small tanks are even lined up in the public stadium. Even the most foolish people know that Fuzhou is changing. She was originally the most gentle and peaceful maiden, but now she has been disguised as a warrior, but in her heart there is only one idea: "Love peace." Although appearance may not be able to change the internal inclination, strong external forces often achieve some effect. Fuzhou is changing.</p>
<p>What Fuzhou citizens are most concerned about is not the future destiny, but the crazy prices that constantly threaten their survival. Prices are like water levels. When prices rise in one place, other places are bound to be affected. Fuzhou is different from southern Fujian. It seems to be less interfered with by the markets of Hong Kong and Guangdong. Leading Fuzhou prices is the Shanghai market. Just open the Shanghai newspaper and look at the market situation column, and you can know the general situation of Fuzhou prices. However, Fuzhou prices maintain a certain limit of difference from Shanghai prices. Comparing the market prices of the two places on the same day, Fuzhou is still relatively cheaper, and it seems that life in Fuzhou should be easier. However, the reality is not so. Because Fuzhou is a city with a trade surplus, Fuzhou has no large factories. Apart from the chimney of an electricity company, it is impossible to find a second factory with a chimney. Labor is particularly cheap in Fuzhou, and many people have to leave the province to work. The family members who remain in Fuzhou rely on the money sent back. However, it costs 350 yuan in handling fees to remit 1,000 yuan from Beijing and Shanghai to Fuzhou, and after many transfers, by the time a remittance is delivered to the family, it has been devalued to a pitiful extent. Therefore, Fuzhou prices seem cheaper than those in Beijing and Shanghai, but most Fuzhou citizens live an extremely difficult life.</p>
<p>In all fairness, Fuzhou is still considered lucky. Some time ago, due to the limited funds of the banks, the money market was tighter, and the rampant speculation was not too fierce. The Yixu Airport is being repaired, and flights on all routes have not landed here for two weeks. Due to the lack of funds, Fuzhou prices have been unable to rise. Even the prices of cloth and other items are slightly cheaper than those in Shanghai. This phenomenon of the market price in the sales area being lower than the market price in the production area is naturally only temporary, but it is not bad for the citizens to be able to catch their breath at this time. A tight money market is naturally a serious blow to some people who intend to stir up trouble in the market. When the Provincial Senate was in session, one senator even proposed asking the Central Bank to move a printing press to Fuzhou to solve the shortage of banknotes. It is rumored that the Central Bank's Fujian-Taiwan regional bank, which is about to be established in Rongcheng, will bring a printing press to supply the logistical expenses of the large army in Fujian. Although the banknote printing press has not arrived, the promissory note printing press has already started printing day and night. A few days ago, public education personnel were paid supplementary salaries and allowances for March according to the new treatment, and prices immediately rose by a factor of one in a few hours. The value of gold, silver and Yuan heads has increased a hundredfold, and the price of rice has also followed suit. The economic theory that the value of money is determined by the quantity of money has been most accurately proven here.</p>
<p>Although the prices in stores have begun to be based on gold bullion, what ordinary citizens are most concerned about is not the price of gold, but the price of rice. The people take food as their heaven, who can live without eating? Moreover, the price of gold is more or less affected by other financial markets in the country, while the price of rice, in addition to rising proportionally when the price of gold soars, the situation of its own supply and demand forms another reason for price changes. Fujian was originally a grain-deficient province. Before the war, it needed foreign rice. During the war, it relied on accumulated grain and Jiangxi rice to get through some days. After the war, foreign rice still did not come, so it had to rely on Jiangxi rice again, and Jiangxi rice needed to be exchanged for Fujian salt. After the victory, Jiangxi no longer needed to rely solely on the Fujian market for the salt it needed, and Fujian salt was not as popular in Jiangxi Province as it was during the war, so the grain supply in Fujian was deeply affected. A month ago, it was rumored that the Economic Cooperation Administration had agreed to include Fuzhou and Xiamen in the allocation area for American aid food, and the municipal authorities were preparing to ration food according to population on April 1. Just as the citizens of Fuzhou were celebrating, news came that American food had no intention of visiting Fuzhou. In the blink of an eye, the period of scarcity has arrived, let's see if we can make rice-less cooking!</p>
<p>In addition to the white terror, Fuzhou citizens are also worried about floods and the plague. Last year, the unprecedented floods caused a major disaster. Now everyone's hopes seem to be pinned on the Fuzhou Port Authority, which is about to be established, hoping that it can use dredgers to deepen the waterways at the mouth of the sea, so that the downstream can be smoothly discharged and floods may be avoided. Recently, the plague has been discovered in the Xiannan Road area of the city. The authorities are advising citizens to step up rat extermination, but what is coming will eventually come. Between spring and summer, Fuzhou will once again be shrouded in a terrifying atmosphere of plague. This year, who will be on the plague god's blacklist?</p>

<p>Perilous obstacles are linked like stone passes, stretching far and controlling Shu</p>
<p>A partial army is repeatedly defeated, and senior generals repeatedly fail to conquer</p>
<p>The moon is cold in the land of the Black Barbarians, the frost is cold in Meng Huo's city</p>
<p>Beacon fires have not yet subsided, the sound of the night watchman's clapper startles many times</p>
<p>The Yi ethnic representative delegation brought unique songs and dances to the people of Beijing and Shanghai the year before last. The drama "Record of Grievances and Gratitude in Great Liang Mountain," which has recently been performed in various places, has also given people an unforgettable mountain atmosphere. Now, a living Record of Grievances and Gratitude in Great Liang Mountain is being staged in the Ning-Shu area, and tens of thousands of Yi compatriots are fighting each other on the banks of the Dadu River. The place where Zhuge Liang captured Meng Huo seven times in the past, the place where the partial army of King Yi Shi Dakai was defeated, is now once again filled with beacon fires.</p>
<p>This war was caused by the dispute over the "Ning-Shu Border Pacification Commander," and it began to deteriorate in February this year. Now the fighting is even more intense. In addition to Deng Deliang and Sun Fang, who are competing for the "Commander" position, each having two regiments of Yi soldiers and Han generals, He Guoguang, the commander of the Xichang Garrison, is preparing to transfer the 163rd Division of the National Army to join the battle to help Sun Fang suppress Deng Deliang. No one knows when this wild and desolate land will be peaceful again!</p>
<p>The so-called "Ning-Shu" refers to the eight counties and one administrative bureau that were transferred from southern Sichuan when Xikang Province was established. Because Xichang was formerly known as Ningyuan Prefecture, the subordinate counties are eight (Xichang, Huili, Yuejun, Mianning, Yanyuan, Yanbian, Ningnan, Zhaojue) and one administrative bureau (Ningdong). In addition, there are sixteen political districts, bordering Wumeng in the east, Yanjiang in the west, the Jinsha River in the south, and the Dadu River in the north, stretching for more than a thousand miles. Among them, there are towering ridges, deep mountains and rushing waters, towering peaks, and the blue of Qiongchi. The plains are fertile and rich in minerals, and the land is located at the intersection of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan and Guizhou, and the meeting of the Le-Xi and Xi-Xiang highways, which is an important town in the southwest. The Xichang Garrison Headquarters, He Guoguang, deputy director of the Chongqing Pacification Office, concurrently serves as the commander and is stationed here.</p>
<p>This area has beautiful waters and green mountains, and Han and Yi people live together. It is estimated that together with the uncivilized Black Yi people who are deeply hidden in the Great Liang Mountain and Xiao Xiangling Mountains and forests, there are a total of 1.6 million Yi people. To deal with these more than one million Yi people with varying degrees of civilization, we have always relied on the armed forces of the Border Pacification Headquarters. The armed forces of the Border Pacification Department were created single-handedly by the old Commander Deng Xiuyan. He was originally a Han Chinese, and went deep into the Yi area alone and created this world. The people most admired by the Yi people are Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, followed by Commander Deng Xiuyan of Lugu and General Yang Ren'an of Fulin. The former controls the Yi people with power rather than virtue, and the latter with virtue rather than power. Deng Xiuyan established such a stable and autocratic regime in the Yi area of Ning-Shu with real knives and guns for decades. The dispute arose in August 1944, after his death, over the inheritance of "imperial power."</p>
<p>After Deng Xiuyan's death, He Guoguang's view on Yi affairs was: "The crown prince is young, Empress Lu is昏庸 (muddle headed and incompetent), not allowed to interfere in politics, and the sub-father is loyal and righteous, and can be entrusted with regency." (He Guoguang's telegram to Liu Wenhui). Today's situation is precisely the struggle between Empress Lu, who is holding the crown prince, and the sub-father.</p>
<p>The "crown prince," Deng Deliang, is 23 years old this year. After his father died, he inherited the position of Ning-Shu Border Pacification Commander at the age of only 19. The power was controlled by his birth mother, Deng Lv Xian. Old Mrs. Deng is already over 60 years old this year. She is gloomy, capable, and fierce. When her husband was alive, she already controlled the power of life and death over the Yi people. No one is not afraid of mentioning Old Mrs. Deng. After her husband died, she became even more unscrupulous and constantly squeezed the Yi people. Although Deng Xiuyan ruled the Yi people with power, he ultimately combined leniency and severity. Old Mrs. Deng only knew greed, so she was deeply dissatisfied by the Yi people. Three years ago, she instigated her son to kill a Yi leader of Tuowu for no reason, which led to widespread dissatisfaction among the Han and Yi people in Ning-Shu. Deng Deliang was then forced to go out and went to the Nanjing Infantry Specialist School with his uncle to receive training. The military power was then completely in the hands of Sun Fang, the deputy commander of the Border Pacification Department.</p>
<p>Sun Fang is the sub-father (Yi people) referred to by He Guoguang. He is the sworn brother of the old commander. In those years, he accompanied Deng Xiuyan on southern and northern expeditions and made many military exploits. He was appointed as the deputy commander of the Border Pacification Department. Although he is over 60 years old, he is open-minded and progressive, and is deeply supported by the Yi people. When he attended the first National Assembly two years ago, he led the Yi tourism delegation to Beijing and Shanghai to observe, and was deeply trusted by Liu Wenhui, chairman of Xikang Province, and He Guoguang, commander of the Xichang Garrison. Therefore, He Guoguang praised him as loyal and righteous and could be entrusted with regency.</p>
<p>After Deng Deliang graduated from the Beijing Infantry School last year, he was officially appointed as the Ning-Shu Border Pacification Commander, his uncle was also appointed as the commander of the Yi regiment, and another classmate named Xiao, who graduated from the military academy, was appointed as the chief of staff. The Ning-Shu area was shaken by this order. The Yi people were greatly shocked to see this young master return to power. At this time, Sun Fang was in Nanjing. Seeing that his nephews were being given such important tasks, he expressed his unwillingness to return. However, Liu Wenhui and He Guoguang could not lose him and urged him repeatedly before he returned to Xichang. This is the reason why he stayed in Chengdu and Chongqing for a long time without returning.</p>
<p>Before Sun Fang returned to Xichang, he had a conversation with Liu Wenhui in Chengdu, so soon the Ministry of National Defense issued another order appointing Sun Fang as the acting commander of the Ning-Shu Border Pacification Department, and Deng Deliang was transferred to be the commander of the Yi regiment. How could Deng Deliang, who had just returned from studying in Kyoto and was ambitious, be willing to accept this? The stubborn Old Mrs. Deng was even more unwilling, so she secretly gathered old troops and prepared to fight. Sun Fang had also heard of this long ago and deployed troops to wait.</p>
<p>After brewing like this for several months, the local people repeatedly mediated without success. It happened that the newly appointed director of the Chongqing Pacification Office, Zhang Qun, took office, and He Guoguang was invited to Chongqing to discuss the Southwest Plan. Deng Deliang believed that the time was ripe, so in February this year, in Lugu, the old nest of his father, he automatically took the position of "Border Pacification Commander" and ordered the "suppression" of Sun Fang. One section of his "Message to the Elders of Ning-Shu" says:</p>
<h3 id="e92">Deng Deliang Tells the Elders: Plundering the Shabaz in Xichang <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>"::Deliang is loved by the local people and commended by the military and political leaders. Without being a mediocre talent, Liang is entrusted with a great responsibility. He inherited the legacy of his post for four years. Every time I think of the lack of talent, I am afraid of failing the expectations of the local people. Therefore, I invited Mr. Sun Fang, who had a deep friendship with my father for half his life, to come out and help, so that he could be effective.承 (Cheng) Sun Fang agreed, and solemnly stated that he would thoroughly maintain it to repay my father's friendship in his life, so I am grateful and cannot help but weep. Since then, I have trusted everything and never doubted it. Therefore, I handed over the entire Border Pacification armed force created by my father to him to be fully responsible:::During the period when Deliang was studying, he suddenly became ambitious and intended to take over the Border Pacification armed force that my father had painstakingly built as his own."</p>

<p>To the Shanghai Shen Bao Office: Our hospital was originally located in Xuzhou and housed and educated orphans of resistance and disaster-stricken children who were poor and helpless. After the Xubang battle last year, we were ordered to move south. Because we were blocked by the war on the way, more than 200 refugee children walked to Nanjing for five days under heavy artillery fire, and then to Songjiang, suffering from hunger and cold. After arriving in Songjiang, we first encountered the cabinet moving to Guangzhou, followed by the merger of the Ministry of Social Affairs. After the breakdown of the peace talks, many local gentry also went to other places in response to the changes. The funding for our hospital was cut off, and we could not borrow money. We had no choice but to take a military vehicle to Shanghai at the end of last month, begging for food and sleeping in the open for five days. Thanks to the assistance of the Children's Welfare Promotion Association and the Relief Association, we have a temporary place to shelter from the wind and rain. However, the children are now eating thin porridge twice a day without any vegetables. If this continues, they will inevitably suffer from malnutrition, and the consequences will be unimaginable. Moreover, after suffering for half a year, more than 200 young lives are already exhausted. We believe that your museum can provide assistance to this group of northern orphans. Therefore, we specially send a letter to appeal to philanthropists from all walks of life to show the great sympathy of mankind and help our hospital in its urgent need. We will be extremely grateful!</p>

<p>Mr. Editor: I am a reader of your newspaper and have been engaged in writing for many years. In the past, I have also submitted my humble manuscripts, and I have been fortunate enough to have them published one by one, which I consider to be a pleasure in my life. Recently, my lease has expired, and I have been forced by the landlord to move out. One master and one servant have nowhere to live. Therefore, I urgently need to solicit cultural figures who have spare houses near Fuxing Park or Linsen Park to seek to solve the difficulty of living. If we can borrow one large and one small room based on the meaning of mutual appreciation, we can write with peace of mind, how fortunate! If there are homeowners who need to leave Shanghai urgently, I am also willing to take responsibility for taking care of the house on their behalf in return for their kindness. I take the liberty of entrusting you. I don't know if you can publish this letter? If there are letters in response, please ask your column to collect and forward them, I would be very grateful! With best wishes, Reader Zhao Ming</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern: I work at the British Shanghai Waterworks Company and am responsible for collecting accounts. Yesterday morning, when I was busy at work, a customer found a stack of banknotes unclaimed on the counter and handed it to me for safekeeping. Until 5 pm, no one had come to claim it. I don't know who the loser is. I am deeply afraid that the original owner is a wage earner, and the loss of this large sum of money will have a significant impact. I am specially publishing this notice to find the owner so that the owner can claim it in time. Sincerely, Deng Bingyi, reader of the Shen Bao, May 8.</p>
