<h3>平漢南段風雲步緊　信陽國軍奉命自動撤離　進犯花園共軍受創西退</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口二日電〕軍息：共軍萬餘人，昨晚進迫信陽東郊，守軍以寡不敵衆，於晚五時自動撤離信陽，準備易地反擊。聞當晚七時，共軍一部巳進入市區。</p>
<p>〔本報花園二日電〕軍息：林彪部大隊沿平漢綫南下，國軍主動撤守駐馬店·確山·羅山後，信腸地勢益形突出，軍方爲掌握機先，縮短防綫，放棄死點，擴大面的控制，以强固武漢外圍陣地，已於昨晚命令信陽守軍完成必須措置後，轉進武勝關附近待命，該地尙未發現共軍。據某高級將領稱信陽一城之得失，不致影響武漢三鎭之安危，因國軍縮短防綫後已集中四個强大兵團於武漢外圍及其孩心陣地，花園情勢穩定即其明證。</p>
<p>〔本報花園二日電〕軍方今晚證實：信陽國軍昨晚轉進時，曾留置若干突擊部隊於該城郊區，以牽制大隊共軍前進，並集結四鄉農民自衛軍萬餘，配合國軍某部，向長合關以北阻擊南下共軍。並悉五綏區之副司令官朱其平，參諜長龔夢濤，於昨晚七時共軍佔據城北高地羊山一綫時始率部突圍向鐵道西南轉進，惟因沿途均有戰鬥，直至今晚八時尙未與友軍取得聯絡。又據今午由信陽突圍過此之豫省綏二旅旅長張玉龍吿記者，朱其平副司令官可能於昨晚農民自衛軍集中後仍留信陽附近，指揮作戰，因截至今晨，信陽郊區及淮河大橋以南仍在混戰中。</p>
<p>〔本報花園二日電〕平漢一綫戰局重心已移至花園以北廣水以南之鄂北平原，集結鐵路西側共軍江漢縱隊及第十縱隊廿八卅兩個旅，暨土共李人林吳志安兩部約二萬餘人，自卅日迄昨夜，與國軍李本一部四個團，在花園以西激戰三十小時以上，結果共軍傷亡達八千人以上，並被俘三百餘人。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口二日電〕據今晚消息：花園情勢轉穩，向花園進犯之共軍經國軍勁旅予以猛烈堵擊後，今午已被迫向安陸逃逸，刻自漢北開車輛已可直達武勝關，但因軍運繁忙，客貨運輸尙在停滯狀態。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口二日電〕自鄂北襄樊南移之共軍聶榮臻部一股，已進抵荊門以北之樂鄉關附近，有向荊門當陽間，鑽隙南犯企圖。</p>
<h3>安慶守軍反攻情勢轉穩　城郊據瞇全收復　望江宿松亦重入國軍手</h3>
<p>〔本報蕪湖二日電〕一度危急之安慶情勢已漸好轉，守城國軍譚何易部，於大量增援後，一日晨起，在海空協同下，向來犯共軍展開猛烈反攻，經竟日力戰，卒將共軍擊退，並一舉將卅一日失守之棋盤山，農業學校兩要點全部收復，斃傷共軍達四千餘人。至此時間，蓋已證實共軍企岡於和談開始前佔領安慶計劃已吿失敗。二日共軍雖不斷來攻，然迄無所獲。</p>
<p>〔本報蕪湖一日電〕安慶國軍二日固守西起獅子山經五里墩。棋盤山·東至農業學校之綫，交部電信局雖因安慶附近綫路通過火綫已被破壞，無法搶修，致有綫電報話已吿中斷，然軍用電台仍暢通無阻。又，銅陵對江之土橋橋頭陣地，國軍已於二日自動放棄。</p>
<p>〔本報南昌二日電〕安慶仍在國軍堅守中，進犯共軍不斷向城郊撲擊，但無重大進展，惟共軍在安慶之第一綫部隊仍無後撤模樣。共軍進入馬當對岸之華陽鎮後，尙無渡江行動，南岸彭澤與湖口情形安謐。</p>
<p>〔中央社安慶二日電〕安慶保衛戰現進入第十一日，名城無恙。進攻安慶之共軍截至現時止，共五萬餘人，戰爭分東北西三面，逐日進行，東綫在農林塲一帶，北綫在十里舖五里墩之間，西綫在山口鎭馮家舖一帶，以東綫爲最烈，蓋東綫接近江面，易於威脅長江交通。十日來之戰鬥，斃傷共軍約一萬四千餘人，俘虜一五二人，自動投誠者一五八人，鹵獲戰利品甚夥。國軍傷亡一千餘人。</p>
<p>〔本報南昌二日電〕進擾望江共軍經國軍反擊後，向北撤退，望江縣城重入國軍之手。聞該方面之共軍爲劉伯承部，又，宿松陷入共軍皖贛獨立旅之手後，昨經國軍突擊，不支向太湖方面逃竄，宿松城又爲國軍收復。太湖國軍仍與共軍在縣城東北地區對戰，太湖縣政府已撤潯。</p>
<h3>應差輪隻經土橋　遭共軍射擊</h3>
<p>一登陸艇中彈受損</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自長江中游共軍發動攻勢後，江左橋頭堡即吿緊張。昨據航業界確息：大通上游荻港之下土橋橋頭堡，業已失守，招商局中字一〇七號登陸艇及海軍安東艦與江漢輪，自漢應差下駛，於一日下午三時，至土橋江面，即遭共軍猛烈砲火及機槍射擊，中字一〇七號登陸艇被擊中砲彈五枚，機槍彈無算，駕駛台門窗及救生艇等均被擊毀，並有官兵五死七傷。安東艦與江漢輪即撤回荻港，中字一〇七號登陸艇急駛大通，日內返滬。</p>
<h3>傳陳毅已抵揚州　指揮渡江部署　儀徵保安團收復城西胥浦橋</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江二日電〕省保安司令部二日發佈蘇北週來共軍動態：（一）江北共軍陳毅部第一·二·三·四·九·十·十一·十二·十三·及長江各縱隊與中原野戰軍暨叛軍吳化文部之卅五軍，其主力部隊約廿萬人左右，均集結揚州以東沿江各地區，除積極整補外，並竭力整集民伕修復各地區之公路橋樑，集結船舶征集船幹，訓練操舟，以完成渡江準備。。傳陳毅已抵揚州指揮渡江部署。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江二日電〕軍息：三江營方面共軍於一日下午三時至七時不斷砲擊，該地守軍陣地，計發砲共七十發，惟彈均虛發，守軍陣地無恙。又，口岸方面日來情况安謐。</p>
<p>〔本報鎖江二日電〕據儀徵來客談：蘇北儀徵仍處半島型狀態中，現該縣軍民在共軍三面威脅下，始終精誠合作，固守城防及四週據點，素爲共軍活動而隨時可威脅江防之根據地胥浦橋，位於該縣正西，一日亦經保安團收復，現芷建立堅强之橋頭堡陣地。</p>

<h3>傅作義發表通電　希望能實現和平</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共電台昨晚廣播傅作義四月一日簽署之通電全文，該電首段抒述渠在二年半來之內心感念以及國家社會不良現象所造成。悲鬰局面之由來，次述渠個人對共產黨之觀察及其意見，希望實現和平，從事國家建設。該電台同時復廣播毛澤東覆電，對傳作義之事實表現，認爲有利於人民解放事業之推進，予以讚許，並表示歡迎其參加新民主主義的建設事業。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島二日電〕前廿九軍參謀長宋質堅，去冬作客北平，適逢局部和平，上月十九日離平，廿九日抵靑，一日搭景興輪赴滬。行前曾與本報記者暢談，述及傅作義氏之出處問題稱：渠離平時，聞傅氏正考慮發表一聲明，表明態度，共方主觀上希望其在聲明表示擁護毛澤東路綫，積極服從共黨之領導，並參加其工作，易言之，卽轉變爲共黨陣營之一員。</p>
<h3>政府對學生軍官衝突案　追究肇事者責任　軍官收容總隊限五日內調駐城外　京中大專陷罷課狀態中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕首都今日平靜，學生與軍官收容總隊，未再肇事。事態可望不致擴大。治安當局爲維持秩序，仍作嚴密戒備。政府方面已決定組織委員會，負責澈查事態眞相，追究肇事者責任，對於原住城內之軍官收容總隊，下令於、五日內調往城外紮駐。至受傷學生醫藥費用，則由政府負責償付。同時並切實責成各院校當局嚴令學生不得於戒嚴期內，舉行遊行及示威運動。</p>
<p>行政院長何應欽今日召見衛戍總司令張耀明，對此次不幸事件之經過，垂詢甚詳；並對善後有所指示。張耀明以此次學生因遊行被毆，未能善盡其治安主管應負責任，已具呈自請處分。敎長杭立武今日曾派員至出事地點，詳予調查，並親自分赴學生養傷之各醫院，表示慰問之意，旋又至衛戍總部，面請張耀明總司令負責妥予維護各校秩序，以謀各校學生仍得安心攻讀。</p>
<p>各大專學校方面，今晨曾召開學生會主席團聯合會，決定組織一善後處理委員會，宣佈自即日起實行無限期罷課，中大政大金大等十一院校，皆已陷入罷課狀態。中大校務維持會定三日晨召集各院系學生代表舉行談話會，在未開會前，希望學生對內對外不再有何舉動。現學生方面要求政府追究責任，嚴懲兇手，通電國共雙方之和平代表，並籲請全國學生予以支援。據悉該會已派代表赴滬出席交大學生會，報吿經過，要求採取同一態度。</p>
<h3>政院取四項措施</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕一日遊行學生與衛戍總部收容總隊第三大隊軍官發生衝突，行政院對此事件極爲關懷，頃已採取下列四項措施：（一）令由敎育部及首都衛戍總部，會同查明責任，以便作嚴正之處理，並由敎育部邀請各有關學校之校長敎授，協助調查工作，務期公允。（二）令首都衛戍總部將城內收容總隊之軍官，於五日內悉數遷移城外，妥爲安置，以後陸續到達者，均應隨時遷移。（三）令內政部長敎育部長親至醫院慰問受傷人員，並請各醫院悉心醫治，所有醫樂費用，由政府負責（四）由敎育部約各院校負責人勸導學生。際此非常時期，安心求學，不可再有聚衆遊行行爲，以免壞戒嚴法令，影響社會秩序</p>
<h3>要求開釋被捕者　學生發書面談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕京市大專學生所組織之慘案善後處理委員暨京市大專學校應變會，二日下午五時招待新聞界，發表「書面談話」，說明一日遊行請願目的，「爲爭生存：提高師生員工待遇，增加敎育經費；爭自由：釋放被捕同學，實行李代總統七項諾言，保障人權，爭取眞和平，反對美援，反對偽裝和平，反對徵兵徵糧徵實，」文中指陳受傷同學係受「武裝特務劊子手有計劃的毒打。」彼等復指出有若干受傷及失踪學生，被逮捕後已送衛總收容隊拘押，要求立即予以釋放。同時向政府要求澈查事態眞相，追究責任，嚴懲兇手，恤慰死傷學生及其家屬。最後表示仍將進行「反飢餓，反迫害，爭生存，爭自由，爭民主的鬥爭」</p>
<h3>和談開始作初步接觸　主要與軍事有關　商談技術問題亦經涉及</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕政府和談代表團抵平後，二日巳與中共六代表開始非正式之接觸，廣泛交換有關商談之意見。北平·南京間之無綫電聯絡已開始，代表團之活動及接觸情形，即經由無綫電報傳抵南京，向李代總統及何院長報告中。惟政府與中共雙方約定商談內容非經雙方同意不得發表。據記者二日晚向權威方面探悉：二日在平之接觸尙未涉及中共所提之八項條件，初步談話之重心，主要與軍事有關，該方面對外傳政府向中共建議雙方停止軍事行動，各守原防之說，拒絕予以證實，惟稱：和談係順應全國民意，和談既已開始，軍事行動停止自應可能。此外，二日之接觸，亦涉及商談之技術問題，政府代表團在平係下榻於中南海，共方招待甚週，行動亦自由。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港一日電〕消息靈通人士稱：中共於今日在北平開始之和平談判中，似不致對國民政府代表團作任何眞正之讓步。共黨電台曾明確廣播稱：共黨不能與「反動份子」組織聯合政府，而顯然共黨視南京代表爲「半封建」政府之代表。</p>
<p>〔本報靑島二日電〕和談代表團專機「天王」號仍留平，但此非中航公司之意。該公司二日下午致電北平公司人負，請即放回，惟共方表示暫緩。</p>
<h3>死傷失踪者人數共一百九十七人　已死者一人重傷者九十六人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕學生所組織之善後委員會，二日招待新聞界，報吿各校被毆受傷同學：（一）劇專重傷卅一名，輕傷廿六名，失踪十四名，其中以方秉祥受傷最重，迄今尙未脫危險期。（二）政大死司機陳祝山一名，重傷學生廿七名，其中何顯慈·丁雍年二人，尙在昏迷狀態，輕傷者廿二名。（三）中大工友·同學重傷者廿八名，輕傷者十六名，失踪者五名，其中百肇驛·杜雪懷·陳道元已無生命危險，程履澤奄奄一息，受傷最重。（四）建國法商重傷者爲劉家齊·鄧世晶·王書鵬·沈建武·蕭紹九等九名，輕傷者十四名，失踪者二人。（五）邊校重傷者吳德義一名，輕傷一名，以上合計死一，重傷九十六名，輕傷七十九名，失踪二十一名，死者一人，（名程復祥）總計一九七名。其餘金大·金女大·藥專·東方語專。音樂院等無無損傷。又所有受傷各學生除一部住校外，大部皆分住鼓樓醫院及大學翳院。</p>
<h3>程履澤昨晚殞命</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕此次大專學生因遊行被毆身受重傷之程履澤，已於二日下午六時半，在鼓樓醫院逝世。按程係中大物理系四年級學生。</p>
<h3>敎授亦有被歐者</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕中大敎授吳傳頤劉慶雲昨日赴總統府請願時，在總統府前亦一度被毆。另中大兼劇專敎授陳搜竹，昨經大中橋因往勸解，亦一度被軍官隊扣留，旋經表明其身份後，始被釋出，此外據劇專代表談尙有該校職員一人被扣，迄今下落不明。</p>
<h3>張耀明聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕張耀明發表談話如下：（一）本京係戒嚴區域，此次學生請願遊行一再勸阻並在各報發表鄭重聲明制止，一面請示李代總統及何院長，奉論如勸阻無效，則予沿途保護，幷維持秩序，本部遵令辦理，故遊行自集合至解散期間，並未發生事端，（二）不料遊行行動解散後，有一部份學生與一部份收容大隊官兵，發生互毆，雙方均有負傷者，本人負責首都治安，此次事件雖出偶然，但本部事前防範未週，本人當不能辭其咎，現已向上峯自請處分。（三）本人於事件發生後，嚴令收容大隊官兵，如再有外出生事者，決依軍法從事，並將收容總隊官佐即日疏散，以後隨到隨轉，並盼各校當局約束學生，恪遵戒嚴法令，勿再聚衆遊行，以免另生事端。</p>
<h3>衛總派政工處長　分往各醫院慰問</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕二日晨衛戍總司令張耀明特派政工處羅處長分往各醫院慰問。據鼓樓醫院外科主任醫師胡修亢談：一日該院所接受傷學生達九十餘人，二日僅餘重傷者十二人，仍住院療養。據中大校方獲悉：中大學生受重傷者九人，其中二人生命垂危，輕傷者廿一人，失踪者七人，其中楊國實·黃啓中·賈文耀·李煥文·楊訓煥失踪，任世韋·李正樂未歸，按此項數字與學生報吿者頗有出入。</p>
<h3>中共方面之態度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共電台昨晚廣播中，對南京大專學生與軍官收容總隊衝突事件，予以極猛烈之抨擊，指責此事爲「國民黨反動政府在偽裝的和平陰謀下，繼續推行反革命戰爭的政策」，同時並指學生之被兇毆，爲預先埋伏之國軍員兵及「特務」所爲。</p>
<h3>首都警察廳長　黃珍吾堅辭</h3>

<h3>銀元存款呢存兌呢？</h3>
<p>— 蔣國炎</p>
<p>（一）名實之辨</p>
<p>白馬之白，非白雪之白。在學術上這是名實之辨，在實際生活的運用上，則為利害得失。名實之辨有時可不爭，利害得失則不可或忽。等値存款與銀元存款形式上雖僅有虛實之小異，實際的後果則正負適得其反。不得不辯。</p>
<p>銀元存款論者分存款方式為（一）存銀還銀，卽收付皆實，可說是正統派。（二）存劵還劵，與以正名實義，應該是「存値還値」，收付皆虛，亦卽今人所主張之「等値存款」，不應張冠李戴歸納於此。（三）存劵還銀，是收虛還實。存銀還銀，主張者已認為於目前通貨無多意義，應予緩辦；茲就存劵還銀論之。</p>
<p>（二）非存款乃存兌</p>
<p>存劵還銀存款，在原則上首卽陷於以物資引誘通貨回籠的錯誤。違背了金融業以貨幣為對象的宗旨。因銀元在目前僅有商品價値而無貨幣性能。為存兌而非存款。其成敗可借存兌政策為鑑。</p>
<p>存劵還銀以保障人民儲蓄及購買力為前提。須知保障應在一定條件之下。此種條件一經消失，保障亦應隨而終止。保障儲蓄及購買力應在繼續儲蓄及有購買物資之行為前為之。存劵還銀經一次存入於取得銀元後，存款的條件雖已消失而其保障則永遠繼續。與等値存款之一經提取後保證卽隨而終止者絕不同。故為物資的保障。</p>
<p>此種存款以市價掛牌為根據，較之存兌政策最後應用之所謂平衡費自屬靈活。然牌價與市價絕不能時刻相符合，乃必然的事實。尤其在通貨膨脹之際，膨脹的速度愈快，市價的飄忽亦必隨速度而跳躍。金銀市塲開業後，銀元的市價可能瞬息數變。牌價絕不能逐分秒而更動。卽使一日之內變更三或四次牌價，期間必有差異之時。藉此種差異卽不難資為牟利。如某甲於晨九時按牌價五千比一百萬金圓劵存為活期。依例隨時可取得銀元二百元。市價與牌價僅須有五十或廿五元之微的差異，則賣出二百銀元再以之存入而可得一或二銀元之利，是乃保障投機力而非儲蓄或購買力。一日之間最少可數次循環，一人如是，千百人亦可如是，卽使銀元無限，收付之行莊已無法應付。其結果與存兌政策時之擠兌是否相同可想而知。是牌價因存取的便利，已消失其限制牟利行為之功能。「存款」遂變為「存兌」。</p>
<p>最重者為通貨回籠。政府曾迭次侈言二千萬美元可收回全部通貨。吾人不防更進一步假定政府所有銀元可收回四倍或更多倍的目前全部通貨。存劵還銀的結果，第一次通貨回籠卽喪失四分之一銀元，嗣後赤字的壓迫，使金圓劵二次出籠。二次又收回去四分之一銀元。如是至第四次，銀元全失，金圓劵第五次出籠皀將無以為繼，終不得不被迫而停止還銀。存款亦因誘惑性的消失而絕跡。試問與停兌何異。何况政府絕無此大量銀元，故為存兌而非存款。</p>
<p>政府之存兌政策本以維持幣信昭吿國人。由無限制而有限制，而加「平衡費」，最後終至停兌。就表面言為存兌價與市價懸殊予牟利者以可乘之機。惟存兌價與市價之所以差由於限制。限制乃黑市竄高之因，而非其果。何以必種此惡因而食此惡果？一言以蔽之有限的庫存不能敵無限的發行。存兌政策之必失敗豈必待擠兌而後知之。以有限制之存兌政策尚不過如此。絕無限制之存款，其成敗自亦可預卜，存劵還銀與存兌除字面外實無差異。可謂存兌政策第二。</p>
<p>再則此次存款之辦理者，據云以行莊自由辦理為宜。但存入旣為金圓劵，則所還之銀元究何從而得？如由央行供給，則央行除銀元之損失外，並應負行莊剩餘頭寸的拆息責任。存款的運用繼則操之於行莊。為行莊計可謂萬全。但以國庫供少數人牟利，何以對全國大衆？</p>
<p>以上為「存劵還銀」原則上的缺陷，已可卜其成敗，試再進而窺其所給與國民經濟之後果。</p>
<p>（三）銀元存款之後果</p>
<p>存劵還銀之運用方式如何，論者未有說明，如為放劵還劵則非銀元存款，已如前述。如為放銀還劵或放劵還銀，則債權樍務者必各有所不甘。茲假定與存銀還銀同為放銀還銀而論之。</p>
<p>行莊對於銀元如不予運用，則銀元將因而無所收益且須損失付棧，卽純為物資而非貨幣。但行莊將因而無所心冷且須損失付出之利息，故必運用無疑，卽必使銀元恢復其貨幣性能。如事先政府未與以法定償付權，借款人可隨時拒絕以銀元還款。故為求得法律保障，行莊雖不必強迫政府停止發行金圓劵，但必強迫政府承認銀元的法定償付權。銀元於是纂踞本位的寳座，工商業以及全民衆亦卽因此不得不收付銀元。於是除圓以下之零星尾數外，金圓劵卽被迫而屏息於產業界及中產階級以上者之門外，降而為每次收付不能以圓為單位的貧苦大衆的貨幣。其結果將如何？</p>
<p>我國在廢兩改元以前，銀元雖為收付工具的本位幣，但上有洋例，行化的兩，下有銀毫，銅元的輔幣。當時洋例行化與銀元價値之微妙聯繫，當尚為人所記憶，惟以洋例旣屬虛形，且僅為極少數買辦階級之貨幣，並有自由鼓籌為之調劑，其利弊遂為一般所忽。而作為找零的銅元則常給大都市，特別是上海的中下層階級以極大的威脅。此種事實當亦尚為人所記憶。當時如能操縱銅元與銀元之兌換律，卽不啻握有最便利之剝削武器。苦力階級晨午所得之銀角銅元於晚間換為銀元，無論為儲蓄或購買一元以上之事物之用，於無形中不能不忍受貶値的損失。有商品價格的銀角銅元且如是，何况日逐膨脹的紙幣。其為禍必更烈。大鈔發行後，小鈔且給與貧苦階級以極大的迫害，更何况銀元。故銀元存款的結果必給貧苦階級以無窮的迫害，除非先廢棄膨脹的通貨。</p>
<p>銀元之准予流通買賣，去年十一月十二日卽有不禁止之規定。至二月廿六日更有下面的鼓勵，然自法幣時代以迄今，除却有靠區域政治力為奧援的處所外，始終以商品自居，而未恢復其貨幣性質，卽有買賣的行為，而無流通的現象。此中癥結，至堪玩味。今人之反對政府明令用銀元，卽由於此。又謂不必禁止者，以其為商品而非貨幣也。</p>
<p>（四）尾語</p>
<p>總之，任何對於穩定目前幣値的方策，應知：（一）政府為一Necessary　evil，吾人有選擇彼此之權，而無拋棄之可能，卽不得不有以豢養之。（二）應透視方策的後果，勿使之迫害大衆而為少數人或特殊階層所利用。</p>
<p>附帶的說一句，以關元或銀元為標價，祗須不拒絕以金圓劵為收付，實無反對或禁止的必要。價格過昂非計算單位之過。如以美元港幣標價，則應絕對禁止，那是民族性的尊嚴，是政治的而非經濟的。政府如以擾亂幣制為名強力禁止以關元或銀元標價，不僅不免於點燈放火之譏必將自殺威信。（三月三十日，上海）</p>
<h3>中共加強平津「竹幕」　謀重建大學敎育　三千大學生關入集中營再敎育　「我選擇了自由」被沒收</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京二日電〕甫自華北抵此之某著名中國敎授二日談稱，中共正逐漸在北平及天津加強其「竹幕」。此一著名之敎授並無政黨背景，而係一絕對中立人仕，渠為顧及其仍在北平的家屬的安全起見，囑記者勿發表其姓氏。</p>
<p>渠稱中共使平津蘇維埃化的初步目標，在箝制新聞界，重建大學敎育，及擠出不被歡迎的外僑。渠稱中共現已完成其第一目標，轉而注意重建大學敎育，圖使大學爹遵從共產主義，並壓迫外僑離境，但蘇僑則顯然不包括在不被歡迎的外僑之內。在平津之蘇僑享有充分的行動自由，中共在佔領平津之日起，卽准施用渠等之車輛。渠稱渠親自看到蘇聯技術人員在平津鐵路服務，同時據曾赴東北故鄕而後返平的學生二人談稱，中東鐵路各站站長均為蘇人，每站並均駐有蘇聯衛兵。</p>
<p>中共正與所謂民主敎授討論重建大學敎育，至於現已加於大學課程方面之限制則為：（一）禁止敎授羅馬法，（二）將社會科學課程改變為「學習會議」，討論共產主義，列寗主義及毛澤東之新民主義，自然科學課程則准許照常授課，（三）反共書籍已自各校圖書館內取去。克拉夫金科的「我選擇了自由」特別為中共所反對，卽書肆中的該書亦被沒收一空。</p>
<p>此外，中共並將被指為有特務嫌疑或為國民黨三民主義靑年團，靑年黨及民社黨黨員的大學學生三千人，集中在德勝門內的大規模集中營中，實施再敎育。同時共黨並發動一種運動，鼓勵學生拋棄敎育，參軍或從事宣傳工作。</p>
<p>中共並成立四個月課程的大學四所，其中甚至有小學程度的學生亦能入學的，此四大學卽華北大學，華北人民革命大學，華北政治軍事大學，及南進工作人員訓練學院，該學院旨在訓練政治行政人員，凖備接收華南。</p>

<h3>中蘇商約訂立後大批原料將運蘇</h3>

<p>消息靈通人仕稱：在草擬該條約時，以掘礦，開墾，探尋油源等權利畀予蘇聯之問題，並不包括在內。以前外傳有此一說實不正確。該方人仕又稱，蘇聯亦對中國作若干讓步，准尤開放中國西部及西北部與蘇聯交界之邊境，按該區中蘇邊境現對銷中。</p>
<h3>潘公展在吳興參會演講　和平祗有一條路　雙方休戰分疆而治作政治比賽</h3>
<p>〔本報吳興卅一日訊〕上海市參議會議長潘公展氏偕夫人等，於三月三十日返湖掃墓，三十一日應本縣參議會一屆九次大會之請，出席演講，大意說：「吳興在目前比較安定，是一塊安樂土，凈土，」認為「這裏的一切還相當安定，實在已不容易了。」繼說：「現在人民的痛苦已深，至少有不滿意的地方，希望民意機關盡量發揮，不必諱言。不過言論自己小的事情，應該看看大環境，如大環境有變化，小範圍一定受影響。」因此，他貢獻對大環境的看法是：「政府到目前為止，對和談計劃毫無凖備。這次和談代表飛平，政府授權代表，將老百姓未來一切的生活，制度，思想，都給他們去管，實在是很危險。」並分析這一次如果和談不成功，不外二種方式，一種是討論到任何一點觸礁，因此和談擱淺，於是乎打。一種是一面在開會，一面在開砲，於是沒有興趣再談，仍舊打。繼說：「和談中最重要的問題是聯合政府，如果政府答應了，這危險極大，因為蘇聯希望透過中共的關係，將中國拉入他們的陣營裏去，一旦組成聯合政府，中共就可像荷蘭·捷克斯拉夫一樣控制全國，而傾向蘇聯，將中國作為戰爭的賭本。美國有一萬四千萬人，中國人死了一半還有二萬萬，蘇聯就可以將中國人民訓練起來，馬上發動戰爭，到那時候已不是長江中一仗二仗得了，靑年的血不為國家流，將為蘇聯而流了。所以飢不擇食的和平，不是眞正永久的和平。」指出惟有一條生路是：「要人民大家起來，顧全國家元氣，要求雙方休戰，分疆而治，大家來作一次政治比賽，看那一個主義統治之下能讓老百姓信仰？但是要有力量給中共知道不能渡江，才可以分疆而治，所以長江維繫了半壁江山，亦決定了中國之命運。」末謂：「長江如能守住三個月至一年，中國還有希望，才可免於大刦。如果這一點力量也不能够盡，那末只有聽任中共宰割，那時候已不能言，不能怒，不能恨，後悔無及了，所以我想在最後五分鐘內，要想法出力」云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約二日廣播：邱吉爾今日臨行在瑪麗皇后號輪上舉行記者招待會，當稱：渠亟願西方國家能與蘇聯人民成爲良友，蘇軍於大戰中作戰英勇，不幸竟爲其政府導致於今日之地位。如蘇聯能開放疆界，使其他國家之人民能進出其間，局勢當大不相同。邱氏並稱，關於締結太平洋公約之意見，自應加以研究，但我人不能將資源作不適當之分散。</p>

<h3>大西洋公約為和平屛藩　美英法拒蘇抗議　蘇次一行動可能撕廢對英法條約</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕此間外交觀察家相信，蘇聯就大西洋公約所提之抗議照會，指該約之締結，爲破壞公約國與蘇聯所締之條約，意在準備宣布蘇聯與公約國前此所締各約之無效。抗議書內又指大西洋公約違背聯合國憲章，表示蘇聯將在本屆聯大中提出大西洋公約問題。按英蘇二十年友好條約係於一九四二＼年在倫敦簽字，怯蘇條約則係於一九四四年在莫斯科簽字，均規定「每一簽約國不得與他國訂立盟約及參加任何盟約反對另一簽約國。」</p>
<p>西方締盟兩種意義</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕美英法發言人冷然駁斥蘇聯所謂大西洋條約具有侵略性之抗議，力言該約實爲和平屏藩。英外相貝文稱，大西洋條約可能爲貢獻於世界和平之最大因素。該約有兩種意義：其一，未來和平即永久和平之解決，必須於下年中決定。其二，該約將使人力軍事援助與經濟援助溶爲一爐。</p>
<p>不事侵略毋庸恐懼</p>
<p>美國務院發言人稱，該約純爲防禦性質，莫斯科只要不事攻擊任何人，即可使大西洋公約下的防務措施母需實施，蓋公約第五條規定須於公約國遭遇武裝攻擊時，始將由公約諸國採取集體自衛行動。蘇聯此次抗議大部份爲宣傳作用，國務院尙未決定正式答覆與否。參院外委會主席康納利稱，蘇聯倘不蓄意武裝攻擊，該約無傷於蘇聯。</p>
<h3>沙地阿拉伯空軍基地　美租用期限延長　新協定不久即可公布</h3>

<h3>蘇報評西方聯盟　稱為黑公約</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科一日電〕蘇聯作家愛倫堡今日在「生活與文化」週刋中發表一文，指責大西洋公約爲「黑公約」。並稱各國政府無論採取何種態度，歐洲人民永遠不願批准該黑公約，國會之批准係屬一事，而人民之批准又屬一事。他人可以收買某義參議員或恐嚇某丹麥議員，然人民永遠無法收買。歐洲人民永遠不願批准該侵略公約，因彼等不願使其傳統文化，由於成千欲藉戰爭發財之商人之錯誤而被毀減」。愛氏續稱，「戰爭販子可以發號施令，但彼等缺乏軍隊，因人民拒絕作戰。世界已被分爲兩大陣營，即建設者與破壞者，保衛和平者與支持戰爭者。法義與英自身亦分裂爲二，美國亦遭遇同樣之情形，國內之擁護和平者正發動攻勢」。</p>
<h3>美一部分議員　主張美蘇和談</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕衆院外委會最有勢力委員之一，民主黨孟斯菲特稱，渠知悉國會議員數人已向杜魯門建議在大西洋公約完成後開始美蘇和談之可能性。孟氏稱，「此項會談之目的，顯然企圖達成一各方皆能履行之協定，以便奠定世界和平基礎」。此間若干外交人士很早即相信西方國家將於適當時期，再試勸使蘇聯對彼等採取更妥協之態度，以便結束「冷戰」。渠等認爲西歐復興計劃逐漸進展，而安全方面亦因締結大西洋公約而有改進，故局勢已達到平衡狀態，在此種情形下，西方國家可與蘇聯平等談判，但國務院尙無有任何此種計劃之跡象。</p>

<p>〔路透社仰光一日電〕緬總理泰金諾今日發表廣播演說，透露政府業已破獲某一政黨在緬北之一陰謀，擬於政府軍向瓦城反攻之際，偷襲政府之，因此政府軍收復瓦城之計觀不得不爲之延遲。該一政黨擬奪取緬北開泰，蒙尼瓦，許威波，賽岡等地，今緬北局勢，已完全在政府控制中。</p>

<h3>史泰遜主張撥款十億元　推行麥帥援亞計劃　迅速採取行動挽回中國赤化局勢</h3>
<p>〔路透社斯頓一日電〕去年參加共和黨總統候選人提名競選之史泰遜氏，今日向麻州理工大學發表演說，要求迅速採取行動，以振作尙未赤化的半個中國。史氏並主張發起援助亞洲撲滅共產主義的麥克阿瑟計劃，每年撥款十億元作爲援亞之用。史氏大聲疾呼「我們袖手旁觀及撤回援助等於協助共黨統治中國，實乃愚笨之至，我們固應顧及歐洲的需要及我本身的經濟能力，但我們亦應經常將我資源的一部份，用在亞洲以抵抗共產主義。此數至少應爲每年十億元，此一援助亞洲的計劃，與其交由任何中央政府運用，不如用以扶植亞洲各國地力性及私人性的計劃。馬歇爾計劃爲大戰結束以來我們所做最重要亦最正當的一件事，目前我們亟應在亞洲發動類似的來克阿瑟計劃，此一計劃應具遠期目光，廣續執行，具有與馬歇爾方案同樣的實施細則，及同樣的目標，同時亦如馬歇爾方案之需要各受援國從事自助。蘇維埃侵略的唯一顧忌爲對抗此等侵略的實力，蘇聯相信某種人終將實施武力統治，故目彼等之觀點而論，不如由彼等來以武力統治，因此除非惑於內在或外來的壓力，當不致自動的給與他人以力量，給予人權或給予自由，若將此一不能避免的局勢與吾人所面臨的特種問　聯結一起，吾人不得不認爲我方之袖手旁觀撤回援助，因而協助共產黨統治中國，實屬愚笨之至。我們必須迅速行動，以振作中國其餘的一半。」史氏並建議利用氣球及高空飛機，散佈反共產主義齣宣傳。按史氏現任本雪文尼大學校長。</p>
<p>〔聯合波士頓二日電〕史泰遜演說中强調援助華南一點，引起共和黨參議員弗倫特斯之同感。據稱，「余恐吾人巳稍嫌落後，一年前余曾向前國務鄉馬歇爾提議在長江流域與華南有所作爲，一如馬歇爾計劃在歐洲之所爲。放棄華北乃健全經濟，但余不知此刻是否尙能出此」。</p>
<h3>法增援越南</h3>
<p>並檢討進剿越盟戰術</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎二日電〕法人民共和黨機關報黎明報今日載稱：法政府決定派遣新援車赴越南，並檢討是否可能修改進剿越盟軍之戰術。該報稱，該兩項決定，係廿八日國防最高委員會通過者，第一項決定係立即派遣人數約爲十營之援軍赴越南，援軍並携有約五百輛之各種戰車，及若干戰鬥機。第二項決定，據黎明報稱，派遣國防參謀總長雷佛爾赴越南，以便實地視察後，決定當前軍事戰術是否應加改變，特別係有關將法軍之單位縮小，分駐於各項地區之戰術。黎明報又稱：法內閣會議中又決定訓令現赴華府訪問之怯外長許曼促美國官員注意越南事件之軍事及外交上之重大意義。</p>
<h3>匈羅保剝奪人權　英美提強硬抗議　責其破壞和約條款</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕英國政府令日分別向匈羅保三國提出抗議照會，指其破壞和約中關於尊重人權之規定，並要求立即採取補救行動。該項照會以匈總主敎明眞諦樞機入獄，匈基督敎奧多斯主敎之被捕，羅農民黨領袖馬尼沃之之入獄及保反對黨領袖貝特柯夫之被執行死刑等爲例，以證明三國之有系統地壓制國會反對黨之言論結社自由及宗敎活動。同時美國駐三國使節亦於今晨採取類似行動。外交界相信除非匈羅堡三國對英美提出滿意答覆，英美將以和約簽字國之地位援用和約條款，召集英美蘇三國駐在各該國首席外交代表之會議，討論應行採取之行動。</p>

<h3>共和黨要求削減援歐費　美參院予以否決　霍夫曼以去就力爭維持原案</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕參院在克服削減歐洲復興計劃費用之力是後，二日凖備迅卽通過五十五億八千萬美元的第二期馬歇爾計劃，但是雖然參院對延長援歐怯案的批准顯屬必然，復興計劃仍將暫吿擱淺，因爲經合總署撥款權力在二日子夜吿終，而衆院在下週前不將提出此項怯案。</p>
<p>參院可能被逼在下週初以前，對延長援歐怯案不作最後決定。民主黨領袖洛克斯則要求參院同人舉行非常週末會議，加速作最後決定。按參院在一日晚藉兩黨聯合外交政策所發揮的强大力量，以六十八對十四票，否決共和黨領袖惠勒提出的减削政府在今後十五個月中要求的援歐費用百分之十五的建議，並以五十四對廿三票，否決共和黨領袖塔虎脫及羅塞爾提出的减削援歐費用五億四千三百萬美元（約總額的百分之十）的修正案。在表決前，曾宣讀經合總署長霍夫曼致蠢院的呼籲函件，霍氏在該函中稱，對援歐費用的减削將使工業復興計劃成爲一種「救濟計劃」。翟氏在最後並暗示，如經合署費用被大量减削，渠可能辭職。同時，霍夫曼對報界稱，由於事實上的原因，經合總署將在本週末暫時停止工作，但目前起運的經合署物資，尙係三個月前所訂購者，故國會對該署權力法案的行動稍吿延擱，亦不致截斷運往歐洲的復興物資。</p>

<h3>浙江的寶藏　氟石礦</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　黃行天</p>
<p>〔本報杭州一日訊〕廿餘年前，武義有位何治韓，他首先發現當地晶綠體的礦石在近代工業上有重要的價值，就進行開采，獲利頗大。民國十三年，象山有位厲萬鵬，也在當地五思山南麓采掘這種礦石，運銷到日本去。這種晶綠體的礦石，就是鍊鐵溶劑氟石。（原名Fluorite，或稱Fluorspar，卽氟化鈣CaF2）。這種常是透明的，光澤有如玻璃的五彩立方晶體，除了約佔產量總額的百分之八十二作為煉鐵溶劑之外，其餘是用以製造氟酸和有色玻璃，還能製造琺瑯，質地純粹透明的，還可雕刻成各種器皿和裝飾品。就</p>
<p>氟石質量而論，浙江是超過南韓，而雄據亞洲權威的寶座。國內如湖南的臨湘，山東的膠縣，山西的交城和熱河的隆化等地雖然氟質也好，但是產量遠不如浙江之豐，而在浙江境內，據調查有金華，義烏，新昌，嵊縣，象山，武義等五十餘縣，其中藏量最豐的是武義，運輸最便的是象山。浙江氟石礦的開采，在九一八以前開采很盛，商民領權開采的就有十八縣之多，每年產量，多在萬噸以上。因為氟石主要銷售對象是日本，所以自九一八之後，產量漸減，直至二十三年，才恢復活躍的現象。抗戰以後，武義，金華相繼淪陷，敵偽華中礦業公司大事開采，分築輕便鐵道至浙贛鐵路或海口，以便運輸。被盜采去的氟石几數十萬噸。勝利後，所有敵遺礦場房屋，電石及剩餘氟石，槪由中央信託局敵偽產業處理局接管，可是三年來，從未加以修繕利用，房屋機器，損壞殆盡，剩餘的礦石也逐漸的風化了，并且不時的被人偷賣。甚至連屬於交通方面的路基和橋樑，也有被居民掘毀的。淪陷期間敵偽用殘酷的剝削手段，以當地老百姓的血和汗開闢出來的現代化的礦場和交通，不僅不能為政府利用，作為經濟復興的生產基礎，甚至連那些老百姓底血汗的代價——已開出的礦石，也棄之不顧，任其風化。敵產處理局對於這種珍貴的重工業原料，旣不處理，也不管理，任其偷運催毀，此種居心，實使人民寒心。</p>
<p>陳儀主浙後，開始注意到這一份天然的寶藏和已有的人工基礎，他為了復興浙江的經濟，決心</p>
<p>開發氟礦并且以氟石運銷國外，換取外匯，購鐵軌回國，在全省重要經濟地區，建築一個輕便鐵道網，作為建設新浙江的輸血管。這個計劃準備從產量最豐的武義和交通最便的象山兩大礦區着手，武義的礦區位於金華東南約四十五公里，大礦區在武義縣城近郊的盆地，面積約佔一二三平方公里；小礦區在離城十五公里的蔣萬洞，面積約佔二五平方公里，全縣的蘊藏量大約在二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇噸。敵偽華中礦業公司管理時，均築有輕便鐵道；在城區的產品，則先運至距城八里之錢江上遊武義港的黃腳灘再用船筏載至金華轉過杭州，敵偽曾在礦區造有二所發電所，和房屋八十間，現在連輕便鐵道全部破壞了。在武義境內，礦商已經領權開采的有五尾龍二公頃七三公畝；長蛇山，人形山十四公頃四六公畝，蔣萬洞二〇公頃八公畝二〇公厘，石龍崗八公頃六〇公畝，共計四五公頃八七公畝二〇公厘。最近浙江省政府建設廳勘定了五個大礦區和一個小礦區，面積共有六三公畝二〇公厘已呈請工商部核準設定礦權。</p>
<p>象山礦區在距城二五·五公里的溪口鄉，毛羊村，五思山，距石浦鎮約五十里，蘊藏量原估僅廿五萬噸，據報已被敵華中礦業公司盜采去二〇〇·〇〇〇噸，而剩餘的礦藏尚不止二五〇·〇〇〇噸，敵遺的氟石也有三〇·〇〇〇噸左右，礦商領權開采的共有面積一公頃二五公畝九公厘，敵日曾目礦區至蟹蚶渡建築輕便鐵道七，八公厘及公路約三至四公里，現在路基均完好，而橋樑涵洞都破壞了。現在省府打算恢復舊有輕便鐵道，則毛羊村礦區之氟石可由輕便鐵道運至蟹鉗渡，裝小汽輪過岳井洋到石浦鎮，再換大汽輪運到上海出口，在陳公洽氏的計劃中，還想自蟹鉗渡展築鐵道至石浦，闢象山為海港，可以直接出口，那時，運輸就更便利了。浙江省政府由駐日經濟代表邵鴻書與日本政府所作的</p>
<p>首次交易以氟石一千七百噸（每噸美金四十元）交換等值之鋼軌，所需氟石，也將從象山礦區運出。</p>
<p>浙江省政府改組後，新任省主席周碞，建設廳長柳際明雖然都是軍人，但他們對開發氟礦，也很熱心，慰留主管科的李科長繼續積極進行。因此，政治上人事的更動并未影響到這個寶藏的開采，但是政治制度卻始終阻碍着這個計劃的積極開采。因為武義象山二個氟礦，和留剩的氟石是敵產處理局以敵產接管的。可是復員三年來，敵產處理局旣不處理也不管理，忍令氟石偷運風化，忍令房屋路基毀壞，認為無利可圖，就棄之不顧，連人也不派一個去駐守看管。祇是把現成的氟石買了一千餘噸給商人；而那位商人卻毫無阻碍地</p>
<p>超額運售發了不少財。可是當浙江省政府決心開采氟石的時候，曾數度公函請其轉讓，都如石沉大海。前任建廳長貢沛誠親自趕往上海交涉，才得到查復，說是已轉由資源委員會接管。雖然如此，但省府有關人員，仍接到私函，說是如果浙江省政府要產權，仍可價購；那位熱心建設的公僕，看了啼笑皆非。在這樣三方爭權的情形之下，浙江省參議會義不容辭地支持了省政府，在最近舉行的大會中通過了一個議案：「查武義，義烏，象山等縣境內在戰時敵偽所采氟石尚未運出者，據建廳估計，尚有五萬噸之多，以之交換輕便鐵道所用之鋼軌，可鋪輕便鐵道數百公里。為此建議省府應仍照前議賡續由省府運售或交換鐵軌，完成輕便鐵路計劃以達利用厚生之目的。又聞此項氟石已由敵產處理局以廉價讓售於資委會，歸其所有，尤應據理力爭。蓋當敵偽盜采之時，礦區附近各縣人民所受人力物力損害甚大，故必須將其所得代價，撥充本省地方建設之用，方顧公允持平。」浙江省政府開采氟礦，槪不是用以彌補省財政，而是着眼於浙江的地方經濟建設，而敵遺氟石，旣由當地人民的勞力榨取得來，自應作為他們血汗的代價，為他們謀福利。何況中央政府也好，地方政府也好，都應該遵重民意，為人民服務的，沒有理由爭權奪利，阻碍經濟建設的推展。浙江氟礦。</p>
<p>前途可觀據專家告訴記者，武義的氟質，在百分之九十以上，象山的成分也有百分之八十以上。前美商江南公司曾派德籍工程師前往實地化驗，其結果和此相同。因此浙氟不僅遠勝南韓所產的，而且還可以在國際市場上和加拿大競爭。現在日本亟需的氟，是仰賴南朝鮮的供給，美國自產雖豐，尚須取給自加拿大。據估計，浙江氟石產銷至少每年可向日本和美國各銷五萬噸，則年可有一百至一百五十萬美元的利潤，以這筆可貴的外匯，來建設浙江，則新浙江的遠景便更容易實現了。我們期待氟礦的順利開采，和繁榮的新浙江迅速到來！</p>

<h3>浙江東北邊緣　（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>安靜因素探討</p>
<p>記者曾經研究這一平安的因素，第一，當然是地方富庶，為真正的魚米之鄉，人民都可溫飽，所以民性平和，民風溫厚，自不會在沒有瀕臨絕境之時，挺而走險，土地問題并不嚴重，因地主以永佃權授與佃農，還稅二五，減租都在減少地主的權益，因此地主階層，已在漸趨沒落的途程中。第二，因為於樹巒專員在這一地區主政，已十年於茲，由於於氏本身的廉介，又由於他的苦幹實幹，所以地方上的一般人，都對於氏具有敬畏之心，因以地方人士，頗為融洽，沒有派系的分別，設有各想獨樹一幟，招兵買馬，以求自己勢力的發展。第三因為地方沒有派系，因以同心協力均為地方打算，自衛組織尚稱嚴密，自衛武力也相當的强，如長興全縣就有步槍二千餘枝，機槍七十餘挺，人民槍法準確，可以步槍射中飛雀。</p>
<p>保境安民第一</p>
<p>於樹巒專員曾為記者道：「我們做地方官的，只知保境安民，如果有人要來侵害人民，欺侮人民，則必為民除暴，數月以來共軍到沒有來境內擾亂，而游雜部隊，散兵游勇，冒充傷患的滋擾甚多。最近江蘇方面有許多番號不明的團隊，流入境內，頗有回復戰時打游擊的畸形發展，紀律極差，人民對之怨聲載道，以故境內漸感不安，如本年度時僅三月，已據報吳興發生劫案八起，嘉興五起，嘉善六起，長興平湖各二起，德清，海鹽各一起，共計已達二十二起，顯然已大感不寗，人民生活如更無改善辦法，則或將增加挺而走險者，前途誠可懮慮。」</p>

<h3>劉文輝與川康政局</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都卅日訊〕最近川康政局醞釀動盪，引起海內外注視，劉文輝縱橫西南政壇廿餘年的川康政局主角，由此更受一般矚目。西康是中國西部神秘區域，劉文輝治康廿餘年，要揭開西康內幕，探尋川康政局脈絡，不能不對劉文輝作一番透澈的了解。</p>
<p>平生歷史　縱橫捭闔</p>
<p>提起劉文輝，很容易令人連帶想到「倒戈」著名的基督將軍馮玉祥，平生歷史，極縱橫捭闔之能事。劉在今日川軍宿將中，資歷比較淺，現年不過五十餘。起家靠大邑同鄉陳洪範提絜，革命北伐，由四川善後幫辦轉廿四軍軍長，打倒同鄉劉成勛，一帆風順，躍登川省主席寶座，并兼川康邊防總指揮。民廿二年二劉火併，劉湘率師西上，昆河一戰，劉文輝全軍潰敗，狼狽遁入西康，軍隊由一百餘團銳減至十餘團，從此劉便暫時告別四川政治舞台。但接着來了兩次機會，挽回他的厄運，一是民廿四共軍入川，川中內戰停止，劉得喘息機會。二是民廿六抗戰爆發，國府西遷重慶，西康以形勢衝要而籌備建省。民廿七中央更將川雅屬六縣，寗屬八縣劃歸西康，翌年省府成立，劉文輝開始正式統制西康。抗戰期中，川中軍人紛紛出川抗戰，劉文輝獨留西康，未出夔門一步，張羣兼理主席，為謀擱平地方，極力與劉拉攏，因之從抗戰到勝利，劉氏始終穩做西康領袖，順利經營力量，以圖東山再起。</p>
<p>康入治康　成功前奏</p>
<p>劉文輝治康功過，康人早有定評，此地不必贅述，但無疑西康自建省迄今，康人普遍對劉不滿，則是事實，因此西康十餘年，都在醞釀「康人治康」運動，如著名的「諾那事件」和「甘孜事件」，卽其一例。而規模最大的則是三十五年「雅屬事變」，事變起因，由於天全，蘆山，寶興，榮經的「暴民」，不滿省府「公煙」政策，起而「抗剷」。不及旬月，蔓延全境，天蘆各縣，均被攻陷，同時上層野心家，更利用機會，普遍發動「倒劉」運動。從川康到京滬，掀起滔天巨浪，使劉的統制權，感受威脋動搖。因此劉便不吝一切代價，從事消敉叛亂，包括大量金錢活動，威脋利誘，省府局部改組，官祿作餌，總算賣盡全力，叛亂始漸消滅。省府改組結果，藉藉無名的陶亮生做了秘書長，陳耀倫作田糧處長，張坦如作教育廳長，這是「康人治康」成功的前奏，表現劉文輝控制西康的力量，開始在走下坡路！</p>
<p>軍政幹部　環繞左右</p>
<p>環繞劉文輝左右的軍政幹部，在今天川康政局中，自然發生相當作用。西康省府代主席兼民政廳長張少揚，西康德昌人，與劉在保定同學，翊劉數十年，為人庸懦平凡。財政廳長李萬華，是劉的經濟「總管事」，在川康金融界力量不小。教育廳長張垣如，原係廿四軍師政治部主任，夤緣倖進。建設廳長張敬熙，前國民參政員，在西康頗負時望。社會處長王孟周，中央直接委派。保安處長王靖宇，康軍元老派領袖之一，這些人都是劉的政治幹部。軍事方面：劉的基本隊伍是廿四軍，劉兼軍長，完全是一支子弟兵，實權全部分掌在「西康少壯派軍人」手中。師長有劉的怏婿伍培英，劉的姪兒劉元瑄，劉元琮，從將領到幹部，都是劉氏家庭中人，這可說是「國軍」中，最封建的，落伍的舊式藩鎮部隊。雅屬事變，主因是軍隊與人民感情太壞，劉縱容子弟將領，亦難辭其咎，一般公論，環繞劉文輝左右的軍政幹部，武不如文，確是事實。</p>
<p>國家大局遽變，和戰面臨歧途，西康形成西部國防重鎮，如何安定西康，建設西康，都是劉文輝當前最困難而最需要解決的課題。以國內和川康當前的局勢，以劉今天的處境，唯一途徑是努力建設西康，安定後防，這是他今後成敗利鈍的關鍵，一切都等待着他明智的抉擇。</p>

<h3>食米狂漲不可收拾　白粳薄稻做十六萬</h3>
<p>米價漲風如痴如狂，一發不可收拾，社會局派員蒞場鎮壓，糧食科長親臨坐鎮，但昨為週六，以二天拆息關係，貨主抬價。又因春假市場休市三天，米店預先添補，去化極暢，價格狂挺，早開最緊，收市轉軟。北市白粳收市十六萬，特粳十六萬五千，南市場白粳十五萬五千，薄稻十六萬，各漲四萬之譜。市場報價仍為上日原價，惟註明現鈔價格，但市場內現鈔交易絕無僅有，二市到貨六九三三石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>價格猛漲，因米價狂漲在前，人心殊為緊張，貨主竭力扳高，漲風猛烈異常，豆油收市七十七萬及七十六萬，計漲十六萬，吉桶生油八十四萬，亦漲十六萬，生菜油六十六萬及六十五萬，一致狂升二成半之多。豆餅漲六七千，交易不多。</p>
<p>麺粉</p>
<p>暴跳，緣因春節休假三天，值此時局動盪不定之際，人心多面看好，且米價猛騰，貨主扳高更力，開市各牌粉一致突破五關，激晋二成半左右，後市米價回小，人心轉疲，回挫千元，老車臨收五萬三千元，兵船以五萬一千五百元成交</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>漲勢仍烈，惟以銀根猛緊，進方納胃甚淡，故交易不旺。黃豆猛晋二成，漢口車豆高做十二萬，平湖杜豆達十四萬，生仁破卅萬大關，芝蔴貨主扳高，市勢僵持，僅奶蔴以廿四萬做開，茍米紅糧齊挺二成，菉豆未做開。</p>
<h3>米市當天頭寸交易　仍未超出十二萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來物價狂漲，食米價格漲勢尤勁，昨日門售每石已突破十六萬元大關，記者昨趨訪社會局局長曹沛滋，詢問對食米激漲事該局有何對策，據曹局長稱：本月一日曾召集南北米市場負責人談話，囑渠等應重視民食問題，勿貪圖暴利，負領導物價上漲之罪名。渠等曾向社局保證，昨日以當天頭寸交易，決不超出十二萬元一石。迨昨日米市場開市時，場中做期貨交易，隔天頭寸須負擔三天拆息，（星期六，星期日，及四日掃墓節，）米價遂暴漲至十六萬元。渠聞此消息後，卽一面令飭南北市場停止期貨交易，一面希望市場負責人履行諾言，據聞昨日當天頭寸仍未超出十二萬元，至以支票交易乃商業上之習慣，外傳渠曾命令禁止，此訊不確。社局於四日將邀集民調處，糧食緊急購儲會，共同商討抑平米價辦法。</p>
<p>又據安全局第一處處長王家樹談：米價暴漲原因，（一）現鈔恐慌，米款無法向產區匯出。（二）舊曆清明掃墓節將屆，鄉民運米來滬者稀少，來源不暢。（三）拆息太重。（四）購買者踴躍。</p>
<h3>黃金公債二次還本　昨已在滬舉行抽籤</h3>
<p>民國卅八年黃金短期公債第一期債票第二次還本抽籤已在中信局四樓舉行，計共抽籤五支，中籤號碼為〇三·一五·四七·七四·八六。自四月四日起，由中央銀行及其委託銀行辦理兌付手續。</p>
<h3>銀錢業硬性規定　營業及交換時間</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行莊營業時間及票據交換時間，銀錢信託三業公會，現已重行規定，聞可能自九日起實行。新訂營業時間，上午九時至十一時半，下午一時半至三時間。行莊收受顧客存入票據截止時間，定上午十一時半。交換票據送所時間在下午二時以前。交換時間下午四時。退票送所時間下午八時前，本票分發退票時間下午九時，補足交換戶缺額時間下午十時以前。據銀行公會發言人表示，以上時間均係作硬性規定，予以嚴格執行。其逾時送票及交換者，作為第二天軋帳論。如有缺單，均不能通融。</p>
<h3>本票發現偽造</h3>
<p>金管局在澈查中</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日市面本票充斥，金管局極為重視，并盼商民等如發現行莊遠背規定所開具之本票，（如票面有一定之金額以及負責人簽章係用橡皮印戳等）得拒絕收受。又外傳市面曾發現有偽造之中國國貨銀行本票一節，金管局亦正澈查中。</p>
<h3>金價堅定　銀元俏利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金趨勢堅定，晨間因二期黃金公債百分之五中籤還本，有五萬兩籌碼流出，人心安定，開盤一〇二萬五千。中途因央行未有拋出，門銷旺盛，銀樓帮金號帮去化活絡，奇昂至一〇五萬一千。臨收因浮多有了，稍低至一〇四萬七千收盤。</p>
<p>午後因值週六停市。同業劃賬價格掛一〇三萬八千，較上日再加八萬三千，合息八角五分光景。</p>
<p>場外</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日場外上午平穩，開盤一〇二萬，一〇三萬，高至一〇四萬三千，一〇四萬八千，午收一〇四萬二千，一〇四萬七千。午後因外埠價格報漲，更以台匯有一百億放出，銀根漸趨鬆弛，暗息低至六七十元，人心看好，當日交割升至一一〇萬，一一五萬，隔日初做一二四萬五千，一二五萬五千，傍晚最後喊高至一二七萬，一二八萬，較上日亦漲四千。</p>
<p>飾金</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀樓飾金平定，上午仍掛一〇一萬，一一〇萬，下午未動。惟飾銀升至一萬一千，一萬三千，軋高一千。錢兌業烚赤上午掛一〇三萬，一〇七萬，下午升至一〇五萬，一一〇萬。</p>
<p>美鈔</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美鈔場外腳地堅硬，因進出口行，銀行帮搜求頗力，開盤二萬一千五，二萬二千，高至二萬二千，二萬二千五，低至二萬一，二萬一千五·午收二萬一千八，二萬二千五·午後成交寥落，隔日交易喊高至二萬五，二萬六，較上日軋漲二百。</p>
<p>銀元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀元昨日套匯又轉旺盛，因外埠價格與本市漸告軋近，雙方均感划算，華南華西等地，套出約八九十萬左右。馬路交易先平後堅，晨間大頭喊一萬七千五，一萬八千五。午後傳央行大量吸收，各方人心俏俐。大頭由一萬八，一萬九一路升至一萬九，二萬。小頭喊一萬五千五，一萬六千五。龍鷹洋喊一萬二千，一萬三千。錢兌帮證券帮對敲大頭，當日支票交易初做一萬九，二萬，午後升至二萬二，二萬四，較上日再加二千</p>
<h3>紗價挺升</h3>
<p>棉紗一致激挺，良以二天拆息關係，執戶猛烈扳高，但直銷仍欠暢旺。晨開四二支藍鳳七百六十萬元，旋在檯面帮哄抬下，趨勢騰達飛黃，午收竟叩近八百萬大關，為七百九十萬元，較前猛晋九十八萬元之鉅。</p>
<h3>多空掙扎劇烈　華股市勢蓬勃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股昨日時屆週末，多空掙扎劇烈，前半程市勢穩盤，後程展開博鬥，大戶哄托，散戶紛了，市勢漲跌差額達一元以上。晨初因隔夜銀根緊俏，市息昂至一元二角，永紗貼息亦高至八八元，九三元，浮多雙重負息，納胃見滯，晨開十三元低價，浮空起補，步升至十四元。旋聞現貨籌碼枯竭，紗帮不斷搜求，證券帮跟納，一度拉高至十五元三角。嗣聞央行繼續拋金，人心恍惚，抬面賣風識盛，挫至十四元二角，終又盤升至十五元邊。近午圈外物價齊升，執戶求單殷切，銀根大緊，市勢再告回挫，終以十四元四角收盤。</p>
<p>中小型股，美亞開後勁升，午收站穩，景福高至漲停。新光先疲後俏，勤興信和走勢均健，其餘各牌數種漲停，什牌亦告俏俐。</p>
<p>後市初聞銀根稍鬆，買氣轉旺，各股一致上揚，永紗開後卽登十六元八角漲限。嗣後微小二角，臨收又登漲限。</p>
<p>場外交易永紗初開十五元五角，中亦升至十六元三角半，嗣又回至十五元七角半收市。餘如新光美亞景福均昂升二成許，全市成交四九億二千六百卅萬股。</p>
<p>黃金公債市況沉寂，成交不多晨開喊六十五萬五千出，六十四萬進，最後升至六五萬有成交。較前上漲六萬元。</p>
<p>外股昨日時值週末，負息過重，各方脫意甚急，初開尚平，嗣因華股報挺，人心振奮，午收一致回堅，怡紗做三五〇〇〇元，三六〇〇〇元，疾升五〇〇〇元。英聯三七〇〇〇元，三八〇〇〇元，一一五〇〇元。會德豐十一萬五，十二萬，續升五〇〇〇元。</p>
<h3>市場散步</h3>
<p>— 看台客</p>
<p>米市已限價　尚應用T夫</p>
<p>米價漲得嚇殺人，想想更要嚇殺人！</p>
<p>米庫在農村，特別在皖贛，長江不能斷流，否則上海人就要斷氣。</p>
<p>為穩定民食，社會局出面管制，恢復限價政策了，但望努力加鞭，確保長期穩定。</p>
<p>有人說：昨天米市，照前天高價十三萬元穩定下來，這是賣社會局面子。實際上只能用現鈔買得到。但是米市交易，平時都用票據，現在現鈔荒，更不會有人再用現鈔票。所以這個十三萬元一石的限價，是有名無實的。至於用票據買，就要加貼水。昨天用週一票子，要貼二天利息，所以非十六七萬不可。所謂不漲，如此罷了</p>
<p>我以為，只要確能維持十三萬元一石的限價，那末儘管貼水或加息，也總可以限制了。問題是唯恐限不牢。限牢了，又唯恐買無米。這種經驗，上海人個個豐很富非凡的。</p>
<p>前天盛傳數十家行莊動搖，昨天報載，說是愚人節的玩意兒，這玩意兒，未免傷陰　。可是昨天消息傳來，動搖的還在動搖。不過推在愚人節上罷了。</p>
<p>聽說有幾家行莊，昨天已獲某某大行莊出面支援，所以幸渡難關了，但還有幾家尚未對攏。</p>
<p>值此本票亂飛的現在，行莊動搖不得。萬一風吹草動，軋倒幾家，可能立刻牽一髪而動全局的。</p>
<p>因為家家發本票，本票反正不兌現，所以虛實無法查明。尤其是本票在市面亂飛，在各人袋裏過夜，本票不解戶頭，在市面穩定時是好的。在市面動搖時，那就危險萬分一不小心，立刻就倒到各人頭上。</p>
<p>濫發本票，等於是行莊濫開空頭支票。客戶不解銀行，在外面流轉，空頭不會拆穿。如果收到本票，就解銀行，銀行就把本票送交換所交換，虛實也就立見。</p>
<p>近來，許多人收了本票，不解銀行。許多行莊尚且擺不穩，如果人人都把本票解行莊，那末濫發本票的行莊，更要站不牢了。</p>
<p>近二三週，台灣匯款，對本市銀根，影響很大。</p>
<p>央行用盡氣力抽，只要台灣匯款到，就把央行打得全功盡棄。</p>
<p>這是一般人的看法，實際已看錯了個中奧妙。</p>
<p>央行拋物資，人謂抽銀根。</p>
<p>但是央行收買物資，卽係塞出銀根。</p>
<p>所謂明拋暗進，可見進之必須暗。那末台灣匯款云云，和暗進不無關係了。</p>
<p>留着本票過夜　風險倒又不小</p>
<p>市價一覽</p>

<h3>滬警雪一箭之仇　仁餘意外慘敗　甲二C健樂奪標希望濃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬警仁餘爾支靑年軍，昨晚在籃球聯賽中作第一二次之遭遇戰，亦即仁徐在甲一組中之最後一課。仁餘亞軍坐定，滿以爲昨晚必可再勝滬警，不料事出意外，大將孫國政缺席，士氣不振，軍無鬥志，卒致全綫崩潰，下半時更一發不可收拾，結果滬警打了一個大勝仗，報復第一循環中之辱。比數爲五十五比三十六，相差十九分之鉅，上半時廿六比十六，仁餘巳落後不少。滬警昨晚手氣相當順利，幾乎有投必中，下半時之後半局，仁餘已全軍瓦解，滬警後防空虛出入未遭障礙大局急轉直下。滬警愈打愈起勁，梁永標相當活躍，仁餘幸沈鵬舉獨得廿一分，撐了不少塲面。上半時最近之比數爲十五比十二，仁餘差三分，此後，相距漸遠，每在十二三分十五六分之數。賽前女子組黎隊輕取力隊，卅五比十四。甲二組C部健樂勝美軍氣象隊，五十三比卅一分。</p>
<p>仁餘戰將爲吳新運·徐仲巳·沈鵬舉·李肇和·王槐庭·滬警爲王伯文·何增·史久全·王蓉生·傅其俠五人。</p>
<p>雙方接觸後，奔彼三分鐘，滬警久全方吿命中，何增又來一球，仁餘鵬舉罰中成一比四，姚文彝代肇和出，七比三兩人恢復原狀，滬警伯文遠中角球，久全亦繼續獲分，仁餘鵬舉擲罰連中，分數遂漸形接近，十五比十二，仁餘僅差三分。不料滬警伯文何增的罰球，其俠又在籃下投中，上半時滬警仍以廿六比十六領前</p>
<p>滬警下半時以梁永標替伯文，梁上塲即一再中怪球，頗爲威風。仁餘鵬舉仲已極力混戰，卅三比二十仁餘莊逸榮代槐庭，卅五比廿滬警伯文易久全，但王不久即因五次犯規仍由史出戰，仁餘亦再由槐庭代肇和。此後仁餘後防常空虛，勝負局勢已定，遂被滬警鐵騎不絕蹂躪，終以三十六比五十五敗北。</p>

<h3>第二循環主力戰　靑白今日對龍頭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕足球聯賽甲組第二循環中主力一戰靑白對龍頭，已因雨展期一次，排定今日下午三時在逸園會師，惟昨日大雨終朝，此塲精彩賽是否能如期舉行，尙不可必，球迷可於午前電話三八六八三足球委員會詢問。如能舉行，派定之裁判員爲何春暉，巡邊員陳吉祥張樂，門券調整爲二千及三千五百元兩種，下午一時起在市體育館發售。</p>
<p>靑白最近因老將退休，除孟義良外，幾全部爲新進，而其戰鬥力量，則並不因之而削减，在甲組中至今猶保持不敗紀錄。問鼎中原，確具把握。但市長盃既以輕敵遭淘汰，聯資中自不再馬虎從事，今日勁敵在前，必將大展身手。</p>
<p>龍頭為東北風舊侶，北派作風，精力充沛，大刀闊斧，乾脆爽辣，極獲球迷擁戴。惜乎該隊在聯賽鬰不得志，市長盃中亦在第一週即遭淘汰，今日再逢靑白，實爲發奮圖强之機會。</p>

<h3>女籃球圈</h3>
<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>談具有體育精神的力隊</p>
<p>對於力隊的精神，筆者始終認爲可貴，因爲該隊成立迄今，業已三載，而每屆參加終是殿軍，可是；她們在塲上稍沒有怨恨的表現，一貫認眞作戰，即使失分距離太多時，還是那樣的精神，這該是運動員的優點。不過—在另一方而我們也得對該隊失望，就是進步的程度太慢，究其理由，不外是年齡小，體格差，練習少而已。這些問題，在今朝看來，已經在轉變過來，那就是她們的年紀究竟比成立時大了三年，體格也顯見加强。同時經騐方面，無疑時多比賽便是增進，而且本屆起更得到了領導的人物，據悉有陳李兩位熱心人士，鼓勵她們，並邀同文馬友于兄爲管理，仁餘球員王槐庭作管理。在這幾項因素的加强下，所以她們本屆的戰績，確顯得比前兩屆要優良了。最近並規定每星期三五在體育館操兵，當然—能維持目下的精神幹下去，則明年此日，一定使人刮目相看。</p>
<p>于指導方面，我以爲頗値得研究，普通目下海上的球隊，多是想學最高舉的技術，譬如像利用假動作啊！以及阻檔法啊！當然—要使一個球隊精彩，必須有這點技術，可是，你得注意，不會跑的小孩，你一定要叫她跳躍，這怎麼能够呢？換言之，球員的基本動作還沒有到把，如何可以學進一步的動作，以至運用方法呢？因此－對於像力隊幾位小英雄的指摘方法，應該着重於基本動作，而怠於方法，不知槐庭以爲何如？</p>
<p>說到幾位小將的團結，也値得一提，她們目從成立時到如今，還是這幾位，就是中間本屆走了一個陳文琰，投奔到黎隊去。陳文琰當然是該隊後衛的柱石，却被她隊羅致，正是太可惜的。這是一個弱隊有一個特殊人材而爲人物色而去，使弱隊的難以進步出人頭地，除陳小姐外，還是幾位老伴侶。願她們合作到底，不要略有成就，受她隊俘去，則在合作一點，終能以長處一起而佔優的。</p>
<p>至於她們幾個隊員，我倒多很熟稔，完全是一支中學學生軍，姚文達范玉瑛翁證雲是錫珍女中的高材生，梁妙玲妙珍一對姊妹花是在新建中學求學，球藝方面而言，前鋒應以梁妙玲爲最可愛，短小精悍，射籃讓人亦不壞，後衛則以姚文彝（）仁餘隊員）的妹妹姚文達爲最矯健。還有王嘉華王嘉萃的一對姊妹，後者前鋒，前者後衛，也是相當不錯。其餘也很是努力卯上的球員。</p>
<p>最後；在筆者覺得力隊有一個最好的收獲，便是每仗雖北，却總有無數的觀衆，作弱者的呼聲的義務啦啦隊。在作戰時的一點精神安慰，例並不是一件簡易的收獲。因爲—這不是僅僅靠球藝不如人而可以得到的，你必須有好的運動精神，始終不懈的現出，才能博得觀衆的內心的同情。願力隊擁有大衆的擁護中苦幹下去！祝力隊前途光明！</p>
<p>力隊陣容：自右至左（後排）姚文達·范玉英·王嘉萃，王嘉華·（前排）梁妙珍·翁霞雲·梁妙玲。</p>

<h3>花邊</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>在我居住的小城市裏，十家人家倒有七八家的女人在做花邊了。</p>
<p>有人說：「女人進步了；不再天天打麻將，居然還能生息一些些蠅頭微利。」</p>
<p>有人說：「窮苦人家的女人，一天工作所得，也够把一個人的喫用了。」</p>
<p>眼光遠大點的人在說：「這是花邊商在剝削家庭婦女的剩餘勞力。」</p>
<p>花邊商人却說：「發花邊是救濟貧苦女人，同時更可以賺回好多外匯。」</p>
<p>如是我聞，「彼亦一是非，此亦一是非，」我却喜歡卑之無甚高論。抗戰八年，內戰三年，大家也够苦了。男人苦，女人尤苦；——少數的女人當然除外。誰人不想享一點悠閒的小福？誰高興一天到晚，拈着一隻小小的引綫，替外國人做點綴裝飾的花邊？飢來驅我，逼人至此，國家對於失業的男人，還全無辦法；對於女人的職業，更提也別提。回到廚房去吧，巧婦難爲無米之炊，更沒有鷄鴨魚肉需要她們去烹調；煮熟一兩餐苦飯，也費不了多少時光。剩餘的勞力，當然詆好貶値出賣了，還只怕沒有人來買。花邊商人雖有剝削女人剩餘勞力的嫌疑，但他們也總算費上不少心力，更要不少的資本，終究比貪汚官吏的沒本錢買賣差勝一籌。雖然他們利己太多，利人太少，但究竟還對人有一些利益，我們也何必再去苛刻地對人家求全資備呢？——幾天聽說花邊又停止發出了，或許是爲了江邊戰氛又濃厚起來了的緣故吧？於是一般貧苦婦人在惶惶不可終日了，由此可知我們更不應該再唱高調。</p>
<p>女人們做花邊固然可哀，我們寫稿子的男人呢，一篇稿費約略等於做一塊花邊的工資。而且更不一定賣得掉，還不及女人所做花邊的彈硬。即使篇篇賣得掉，那也只好稱之謂「花邊文學」。</p>
<p>街頭可可作響的「花邊」，那纔是彈硬的東西。安得女人花邊的工資，都是可可作響的「花邊」；男人的「花邊文學」的稿費，也是叮叮作響的「花邊」。</p>
<p>花邊！花邊！二十世紀的花邊！這個名詞，恐怕後世編輯「中文大辭典」的學者們，也會弄不淸楚的罷。</p>
<h3>獃子及其他</h3>
<p>— 斐宇</p>
<p>波斯有四句成語說：</p>
<p>一個人，他不知道這件事，也不知道他自己不知道這件事，是個獃子；避開他。</p>
<p>一個人，他不知道這件事，却知道他自己不知道這件事，是個孩子；敎育他。</p>
<p>一個人，他知道這件事，却不知道他自己知道這伴事，是　睡者；叫醒他。</p>
<p>一個人，他知道這件事，也知道他自己知道這件事，是聰明人；跟隨他。</p>

<p>在匈牙利中部費里哈柴地方，農民們正在用音樂幫助母牛產奶。每天傍晚，給母牛聽無綫電所播送的音樂，可以使牛奶產量增加百分之十到百分之十五。他們並且發覺：母牛只對某種音樂發生興趣，大多數喜歡古典派音樂，年靑的母牛喜歡輕鬆的音樂，而年老的則喜歡爵士音樂。</p>
<p>望遠照相機</p>
<p>拍攝比基尼原子彈試騐的照相機，約計共有六百只左右，其中有一只是世界上最大的望遠照相機。該機重二百磅，鏡頭長四十八吋，能在一千五百呎外淸晰地拍出一只直徑八吋長的時鐘上的秒針。</p>
<p>烏龜的眼睛</p>
<p>動物眼睛的顏色，很少因性別而不同。但菲洲的一種烏龜，却雌雄眼睛色澤不同。雄龜的眼睛是紅色的，而雌龜的眼睛則是黃色的。</p>
<h3>本票的故事</h3>
<p>— 缺貝</p>
<p>學校派人送來了一張五萬元的本票，——本月份薪水按照新倍數所補發的數目。</p>
<p>一看本票上並未劃綫，大喜；因爲根據常識：不劃綫者可以兌現之謂也。便連忙奔出門外，叫三輪車上銀行去兌，因爲明日封關，此刻又已下午二時多了。</p>
<p>結果，銀行職員說「不好掉」。我申述了一大篇不劃綫就應兌現的理由，他聽也不聽；我垂着頭，步行折回，因爲僅有的兩張五百元現鈔，剛才已給了三輪車「先生」，現在連電車也坐不成了。</p>
<p>由是我無聊在五萬元的薪水項下註上一筆：「减車費一千元」</p>
<p>問問居們有無辦法？都說買東西可以通用，但不能找還零數。這對於我當然不行。我這五萬元，得應付一個月中各式各樣的開支的。</p>
<p>但是妻說：「把本票放在家裏總不是辦怯，何况明天的蔬菜油鹽都非付現鈔不可。再說，幣値日縮夜小，留不得」。仔細思量後，忽又大喜：辦法有了。剛才看見人家以本票買銀元，那麼有了銀元，不是就可有現鈔了嗎？又急急地奔到河南路，「大頭有嗎？本票行不行？」銀販點點頭，不過說要打折扣。這當然很吃虧，但想想爲了一張五萬元本票而東西奔走，又何苦呢？便照辦了：一萬當九千元用，五萬元本票依「大頭」一一二價格可買四個，而且還可優待地找還五百廿元。這，我已很知足了。</p>
<p>然而，銀元還得換了現鈔，以便應付房東和自己的肚皮。由是只得再度乞靈於銀販：「大頭要嗎？剛好銀市在上漲，得以一一一價脫了手，雖然又已損失八百元，然這個行情，我認爲已證明並未做「洋盤」了。</p>
<p>本想再步行回家，但想想一個人又何必如此做金錢的奴隸呢，今天跑得己够累了。便登了電軍，以剛才銀販找來的五百廿元中的四百元，乘了頭等電車回家。今日之「小公敎」尙能乘頭等電車，我覺得也很可滿足了。</p>
<p>回到了家，再計算一下，又在薪水金額下再註幾筆：</p>
<p>再减車資四百元；</p>
<p>再减本票打折扣數五千元；</p>
<p>再減銀元一進一出的損失八百元；</p>
<p>再减本日拆息，依六角計，應爲三千元；</p>
<p>連同剛才的三輪車費一千元，共應减去一萬零二百元。由是：五萬薪水，實收是三萬九千八百元。</p>
<h3>題凌虛寫熊貓圖</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>昨偕散木止茫萬頃齋，主人出示近作熊貓圖，筆簡意全，水墨淋　，殊覺可喜。此物前人未曾入盡，今驟見之，頗爲新異，惟仍以國盡法法則出之，誠與石恪風子暗合，即席賦題。聞主人近有招生授畫之舉，他日門牆桃李，受其薰陶，必將爲藝壇放一異彩矣。</p>
<p>蕭蕭四壁空，莽莽靑天影。六時生雄風，上接鴻荒境。嗟哉畫師畫，攝取猛虎猛。鼠輩徒爾爾，曷其歛馳騁。腹飽終須僵，斯乃臻至靜。</p>
<h3>「第三次打擊」</h3>
<p>— 王冊</p>
<p>—一張卓越的戰爭片</p>
<p>蘇聯的戰爭影片，與好萊來塢的，在氣質上有許多不同之點。好萊塢的戰爭影片，常常爲了過於「賣弄」，以至損害了主題的發展。而在蘇聯「第三次打擊」裏，導演把握了蘇聯戰士與他們統師的沉着計謀，如何在廣大的戰棧上分兵合圍，終於擊潰了德軍的防守。</p>
<p>在渡河，爬山，衝鋒，格闘，戰士們出擊的塲面上，導演與攝影的心力，是隨處可見的。</p>
<p>僅就空中攝擊的一個鏡頭來看，也就可以看出在鏡頭的運用上，已達到了卓越的地步。戲的開塲，是德軍防守的克雷木要塞，鏡頭由空中平面搖下來，當到達地面時，鏡頭由鐵絲網上空搖下，一直到壕暫裏。然後，展開德軍的防禦工事，予人一種淸新圓活的惑覺。</p>
<p>其次是在氣氛上的。一九四四年春天，正是蘇軍在統帥部整個作戰計劃之下，準備出擊的時侯。戰地上很沉寂，四郊鮮花怒放，天氣暖和了。蘇聯年靑戰士們熬不住他要衝到敵人陣地裏去。那些看意盪漾的畫面，被處理得極乾凈利落。而在進軍之前的大地寗靜無聲，到佔領古雷木後的戰士們在鮮花叢中幷肩高歌前進，都顯示本片優越的情調。</p>
<p>本片顯示德軍由列寗格勒之役到克里米亞之役的屢遭慘敗，使德軍動搖了吞噬蘇聯與歐洲大陸的信心。演員演技洗鍊，飾史達林的極神似。全片如若更能以一二個人物貫穿起來，則戲劇的效果，當可更加增强了。</p>

<h3>The Situation on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway Becomes Tense; Nationalist Troops in Xinyang Ordered to Withdraw Voluntarily; Communist Troops Attacking Huayuan Suffer Losses and Retreat Westward</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 2nd] Military News: More than 10,000 Communist troops pressed upon the eastern suburbs of Xinyang last night. The defending troops, outnumbered, voluntarily withdrew from Xinyang at 5:00 PM, preparing to counterattack from another location. It is reported that some Communist troops entered the city area at 7:00 PM that evening.</p>
<p>[Our Huayuan Dispatch, 2nd] Military News: Lin Biao's forces, in large numbers, advanced south along the Pinghan Railway. After Nationalist troops proactively withdrew from Zhumadian, Queshan, and Luoshan, the terrain of Xinyang became increasingly prominent. To gain a tactical advantage, shorten the defense line, abandon insignificant points, and expand area control, thereby strengthening the outer defenses of Wuhan, the military authorities ordered the Xinyang garrison last night to complete necessary arrangements and then move to the vicinity of Wusheng Pass to await orders. No Communist troops have been found in that area yet. According to a senior general, the gain or loss of Xinyang will not affect the safety of the three towns of Wuhan, as the Nationalist army has concentrated four powerful corps in the outer and core positions of Wuhan after shortening the defense line, and the stable situation in Huayuan is a clear indication of this.</p>
<p>[Our Huayuan Dispatch, 2nd] The military authorities confirmed tonight: When the Nationalist troops in Xinyang withdrew last night, they left some commando units in the suburbs of the city to contain the advance of the main Communist forces. They also gathered more than 10,000 farmers' self-defense forces from the surrounding villages to cooperate with a certain unit of the Nationalist army in blocking the southward Communist forces north of Changhe Pass. It is also learned that Zhu Qiping, deputy commander of the Fifth Pacification Zone, and Gong Mengtao, chief intelligence officer, only led their troops to break through and retreat to the southwest of the railway at 7:00 PM last night when the Communist troops occupied the Yangshan line, a high ground north of the city. However, due to fighting along the way, they have not yet made contact with friendly forces as of 8:00 PM tonight. Furthermore, Zhang Yulong, commander of the Second Pacification Brigade of Henan Province, who broke through from Xinyang and passed through here this afternoon, told reporters that Deputy Commander Zhu Qiping may have remained near Xinyang after the farmers' self-defense forces gathered last night to command the battle, as sporadic fighting continued in the suburbs of Xinyang and south of the Huaihe River bridge until this morning.</p>
<p>[Our Huayuan Dispatch, 2nd] The focus of the battle on the Pinghan Railway has shifted to the plains of northern Hubei, north of Huayuan and south of Guangshui. About 20,000 Communist troops, including the Jianghan Column and the 28th and 30th Brigades of the Tenth Column, as well as the local Communist forces of Li Renlin and Wu Zhian, gathered on the west side of the railway. From the 30th to last night, they engaged in fierce fighting for more than 30 hours west of Huayuan with four regiments of Li Benyi's Nationalist army. As a result, the Communist troops suffered more than 8,000 casualties and more than 300 were captured.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 2nd] According to news this evening: The situation in Huayuan has stabilized. After being fiercely blocked by the elite troops of the Nationalist army, the Communist troops who attacked Huayuan were forced to flee towards Anlu this afternoon. Vehicles can now travel directly from northern Hubei to Wusheng Pass, but passenger and freight transport is still suspended due to busy military transport.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 2nd] A force of Nie Rongzhen's Communist troops, which moved south from Xiangfan in northern Hubei, has reached the vicinity of Lexiang Pass, north of Jingmen, and is attempting to infiltrate south between Jingmen and Dangyang.</p>
<h3>The Counter-Offensive by the Anqing Garrison Turns the Situation Stable; All Suburban Strongholds are Recaptured; Wangjiang and Susong Also Return to Nationalist Hands</h3>
<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 2nd] The once-critical situation in Anqing has gradually improved. After receiving substantial reinforcements, the Nationalist troops defending the city, under Tan Heyi, launched a fierce counterattack against the invading Communist troops on the morning of the 1st, with naval and air support. After a day of fierce fighting, they finally repelled the Communist troops and recaptured all the key points of Qipan Mountain and the Agricultural School, which had been lost on the 31st, killing or wounding more than 4,000 Communist troops. By this time, it had been confirmed that the Communist army's plan to occupy Anqing before the start of peace talks had failed. Although the Communist troops continued to attack on the 2nd, they have achieved nothing so far.</p>
<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 1st] On the 2nd, the Nationalist troops in Anqing firmly defended the line stretching from Lion Mountain in the west, through Wulidun, Qipan Mountain, and east to the Agricultural School. Although the lines near Anqing, which were used by the Ministry of Communications' telecommunications bureau, have been destroyed passing through the fire line and cannot be repaired, causing wired telegraph and telephone communications to be interrupted, military radio communications are still unhindered. In addition, the Nationalist troops voluntarily abandoned the Tuchiao bridgehead position opposite Tongling on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 2nd] Anqing is still firmly held by the Nationalist army. The invading Communist troops are constantly launching attacks on the suburbs of the city, but have made no significant progress. However, the Communist army's frontline troops in Anqing still show no signs of retreating. After the Communist troops entered Huayang Town on the opposite bank of Madang, there has been no movement to cross the river. The situation in Pengze and Hukou on the south bank is peaceful.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Anqing, 2nd] The Battle of Anqing is now entering its eleventh day, and the famous city remains intact. The Communist troops attacking Anqing total more than 50,000 as of now. The battle is conducted daily on the northeast, west, and east sides of the city. The eastern front is in the area of the Agricultural and Forestry Farm, the northern front is between Shilipu and Wulidun, and the western front is in the area of Shankouzhen and Fengjiapu, with the eastern front being the most intense, as it is close to the river and easily threatens the Yangtze River transportation. In the battles of the past ten days, approximately 14,000 Communist troops have been killed or wounded, 152 captured, and 158 have surrendered voluntarily. A large quantity of war booty has been seized. The Nationalist army has suffered more than 1,000 casualties.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 2nd] After being counterattacked by the Nationalist army, the Communist troops who disturbed Wangjiang retreated north, and the county seat of Wangjiang returned to Nationalist hands. It is reported that the Communist troops in that area belong to Liu Bocheng's forces. Furthermore, after Susong fell into the hands of the Anhui-Jiangxi Independent Brigade of the Communist army, they were attacked by the Nationalist army yesterday and, unable to withstand the assault, fled towards Taihu. Susong City was then recaptured by the Nationalist army. The Nationalist troops in Taihu are still fighting the Communist army in the northeast of the county seat. The Taihu County government has withdrawn to Xunyang.</p>
<h3>A Landing Craft Passing Through Tuchiao is Fired Upon by Communist Troops</h3>
<p>One Landing Craft Damaged by Gunfire</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Since the Communist army launched an offensive in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the bridgehead on the left bank of the river has become tense. Yesterday, reliable sources in the shipping industry reported that the Tuchiao bridgehead, upstream of Datong and downstream of Digang, had been lost. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's landing craft Zhongzi No. 107, as well as the Navy's Andong warship and the Jianghan steamer, traveling downstream from Hankou, were fiercely bombarded with artillery and machine-gun fire by Communist troops at 3:00 PM on the 1st, while on the Yangtze River surface in Tuchiao. Zhongzi No. 107 was hit by five artillery shells and countless machine-gun bullets. The pilothouse doors and windows and lifeboats were destroyed, and five officers and soldiers were killed and seven were wounded. The Andong warship and the Jianghan steamer immediately withdrew to Digang, and Zhongzi No. 107 urgently sailed to Datong and will return to Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Chen Yi Has Arrived in Yangzhou to Command the Crossing-the-River Deployment; the Yizheng Security Regiment Recaptures Xupu Bridge, West of the City</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] The Provincial Security Headquarters released information on the movements of the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu over the past week: (1) The main forces of the Communist army in Jiangbei, including Chen Yi's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th Columns, and the Yangtze River Columns, as well as the Central Plains Field Army and the 35th Army of the rebel Wu Huawen, totaling about 200,000 men, are concentrated in the areas along the river east of Yangzhou. In addition to actively reorganizing and replenishing their forces, they are also making every effort to gather laborers to repair roads and bridges in various areas, gather ships, recruit boatmen, and train in boat handling to complete preparations for crossing the river. It is rumored that Chen Yi has arrived in Yangzhou to command the crossing-the-river deployment.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] Military News: The Communist troops in the Sanjiangying area continuously bombarded the defensive positions of the garrison from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 1st, firing a total of 70 rounds. However, all rounds missed their target, and the garrison's position remained undamaged. In addition, the situation in the Kouan area has been peaceful in recent days.</p>
<p>[Our Suojiang Dispatch, 2nd] According to visitors from Yizheng: Yizheng in northern Jiangsu is still in a peninsula-like state. Currently, the military and civilians of the county are cooperating sincerely to defend the city and surrounding strongholds under the threat of the Communist army from three sides. Xupu Bridge, a base for Communist activities that can threaten the river defenses at any time, is located directly west of the county. It was also recaptured by the Security Regiment on the 1st, and a strong bridgehead position is now being established.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Have Decided on Measures for the Exchange of Goods Between the North and South Banks of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 2nd] The authorities have decided on appropriate measures for passenger and freight traffic between Zhenjiang and Guazhou, as well as the exchange of goods between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River, and will implement them in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Qingdao and the Communist Areas Have Reached an Agreement on the Exchange of Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 2nd] Qingdao and the Communist areas reached an agreement on the exchange of goods on the 2nd: (1) A Qingdao Municipal Goods Exchange Committee will be established. (2) The goods to be exchanged with Ji'nan and Tianjin are coal, cotton, and peanuts, while the goods to be exported are cotton yarn, colored cloth, matches, paper, pigments, and bicycle tires. (3) Three representatives will be appointed: Chang Yinji of the power plant, one person from China Textile Corporation (the business section or materials section chief is to be determined), and one person from the match company. (4) A telegram was sent to Li Zhuchen, chairman of the Tianjin Industrial Association (previous telegrams were also in contact with Mr. Li), this afternoon to request his consent from the Communist side. The representatives will go to Ji'nan and then to Tianjin by land. They will visit Chairman Qin for instructions on Monday, and the first exchange is expected to be 30,000 tons of coal.</p>
<h3>Fu Zuoyi Issues a Circular Telegram, Hoping to Achieve Peace</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Communist radio station broadcasted the full text of Fu Zuoyi's circular telegram signed on April 1st last night. The telegram's first paragraph expresses Fu Zuoyi's feelings over the past two and a half years and the origins of the tragic situation caused by the adverse phenomena in the country and society. The second paragraph describes Fu Zuoyi's personal observations and opinions on the Communist Party, hoping to achieve peace and engage in national construction. The radio station also broadcasted Mao Zedong's reply, praising Fu Zuoyi's factual performance as conducive to the advancement of the people's liberation cause and expressing welcome to his participation in the construction of the new democracy.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 2nd] Song Zhijian, former chief of staff of the 29th Army, was visiting Beijing last winter and happened to be there during the local peace talks. He left Beijing on the 19th of last month and arrived in Qingdao on the 29th. On the 1st, he took the Jingxing steamer to Shanghai. Before his departure, he spoke frankly with our newspaper reporter about the issue of Fu Zuoyi's future, saying that when he left Beijing, he heard that Fu Zuoyi was considering issuing a statement to express his attitude. The Communist side subjectively hoped that he would express his support for Mao Zedong's line in the statement, actively obey the leadership of the Communist Party, and participate in their work. In other words, he would be transformed into a member of the Communist Party's camp.</p>
<h3>The Government Investigates the Responsibility for the Conflict Between Students and Military Officers; the Military Officer Reception Headquarters Must Move to Outside the City Within Five Days; Universities in Nanjing are in a State of Strike</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The capital is calm today. No further incidents have occurred between the students and the military officer reception headquarters. The situation is not expected to escalate. The public security authorities are maintaining strict security to maintain order. The government has decided to organize a committee to thoroughly investigate the truth of the incident and investigate the responsibility of those who caused the trouble. The military officer reception headquarters originally located in the city has been ordered to move to outside the city within five days. The government will be responsible for the medical expenses of the injured students. At the same time, the authorities of each university are required to strictly order students not to hold parades or demonstrations during the martial law period.</p>
<p>Premier He Yingqin summoned Garrison Commander Zhang Yaoming today and inquired in detail about the course of this unfortunate incident, and gave instructions on the aftermath. Zhang Yaoming has submitted a request for punishment, holding himself responsible as the chief of public security for failing to properly fulfill his responsibilities when students were beaten during the parade. Minister of Education Hang Liwu sent personnel to the scene of the incident today to investigate in detail, and personally visited the hospitals where the students were being treated to express his condolences. He then went to the Garrison Headquarters and asked Commander Zhang Yaoming to take responsibility for properly maintaining order in the schools so that the students can continue their studies in peace.</p>
<p>The student unions of major universities convened a joint meeting of the presidium this morning and decided to organize an aftercare committee, announcing an indefinite strike starting immediately. Eleven universities including Central University, National Chengchi University, and Jinling University have entered a state of strike. The Central University School Affairs Maintenance Committee is scheduled to convene a discussion meeting of student representatives from various departments on the morning of the 3rd. Before the meeting, they hope that students will not take any action internally or externally. The students are now demanding that the government investigate responsibility, severely punish the perpetrators, send telegrams to the peace representatives of both the Nationalists and the Communists, and appeal to students across the country for support. It is learned that the committee has sent representatives to Shanghai to attend the student union of Jiaotong University, report on the process, and request the adoption of the same attitude.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Takes Four Measures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the conflict between parading students and officers of the Third Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters Reception Headquarters on the 1st, the Executive Yuan is very concerned about this incident and has taken the following four measures: (1) Order the Ministry of Education and the Capital Garrison Headquarters to jointly investigate the responsibility so as to make a just handling, and invite the principals and professors of the relevant schools to assist in the investigation to ensure fairness. (2) Order the Capital Garrison Headquarters to move all officers of the reception headquarters in the city to outside the city within five days, properly resettle them, and those who arrive later should be moved at any time. (3) Order the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Education to personally visit the injured in the hospital and ask the hospitals to treat them carefully. All medical expenses will be borne by the government. (4) The Ministry of Education will ask the heads of the universities to persuade the students to study in peace during this extraordinary period, and not to have gatherings, parades, and acts, so as not to violate the martial law and affect social order.</p>
<h3>Demanding the Release of Those Arrested, Students Issue Written Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The aftercare committee organized by university students in Nanjing and the emergency meeting of universities in Nanjing held a reception for the press at 5:00 PM on the 2nd and issued a "written statement" explaining the purpose of the parade and petition on the 1st: "To fight for survival: to improve the treatment of teachers, students, and staff, to increase education funding; to fight for freedom: to release arrested students, to implement the seven promises of Acting President Li, to protect human rights, to strive for true peace, to oppose US aid, to oppose disguised peace, to oppose conscription of soldiers, conscription of grain, and conscription of real goods." The statement pointed out that the injured students were subjected to "planned beatings by armed secret agents and executioners." They also pointed out that some injured and missing students had been arrested and sent to the Garrison Headquarters Reception Team for detention, demanding their immediate release. At the same time, they demanded that the government thoroughly investigate the truth of the incident, investigate responsibility, severely punish the perpetrators, and provide condolences to the dead and injured students and their families. Finally, they stated that they would continue to carry out the "struggle against hunger, against persecution, for survival, for freedom, and for democracy."</p>
<h3>Preliminary Contacts Begin for Peace Talks; Mainly Related to Military Affairs; Technical Issues of Negotiation Also Involved</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] After the government peace delegation arrived in Beijing, it began informal contacts with the six Communist representatives on the 2nd, broadly exchanging views on relevant negotiations. Wireless communication between Beijing and Nanjing has begun. The activities and contacts of the delegation are being reported to Acting President Li and Premier He in Nanjing via radio telegram. However, the government and the Communist Party agreed that the content of the negotiations cannot be published without the consent of both parties. According to authoritative sources this evening: the contacts in Beijing on the 2nd did not involve the eight conditions proposed by the Communist Party. The focus of the initial talks was mainly related to military affairs. That side refused to confirm the external rumors that the government suggested that both parties stop military actions and defend their original positions, but stated that peace talks are in line with national public opinion, and since the peace talks have begun, the cessation of military actions should be possible. In addition, the contacts on the 2nd also involved technical issues of negotiation. The government delegation is staying at Zhongnanhai in Beijing, and the Communist side is providing very good hospitality and freedom of movement.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 1st] Well-informed sources said: In the peace talks that began today in Beijing, the Chinese Communists do not seem likely to make any real concessions to the Nationalist government delegation. Communist radio has clearly broadcast that the Communist Party cannot form a coalition government with "reactionaries," and the Communist Party apparently regards the Nanjing representatives as representatives of a "semi-feudal" government.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 2nd] The peace delegation's special plane "Tianwang" (Heavenly King) is still staying in Beijing, but this is not the intention of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). The company sent a telegram to the personnel of the Beijing office this afternoon, requesting its immediate return, but the Communist side indicated that it would be postponed.</p>

He was released after showing his identity. According to the representatives of the Drama Academy, one staff member of the school was also detained and his whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yaoming's Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Zhang Yaoming issued the following statement: (1) This capital is a martial law area. Students' petitions and parades have been repeatedly dissuaded and solemnly declared in newspapers to stop them. At the same time, Acting President Li and Premier He were asked for instructions. We were told that if dissuasion was ineffective, protection would be provided along the way and order maintained. This headquarters followed the order to handle the situation, so no incidents occurred from the time of assembly to the time of dispersal of the parade. (2) Unexpectedly, after the parade dispersed, some students and some officers and soldiers of the reception team had a mutual fight, and both sides were injured. I am responsible for the security of the capital. Although this incident was accidental, this headquarters did not take adequate precautions beforehand, and I cannot shirk my responsibility. I have now asked my superiors for punishment. (3) After the incident, I strictly ordered the officers and soldiers of the reception team that if they cause trouble outside again, they will be dealt with according to military law. The officers of the reception team will be evacuated immediately, and those who arrive later will be transferred immediately. I also hope that the authorities of each school will restrain the students and strictly abide by martial law, and not gather in parades again to avoid new incidents.</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] In broadcasts last night, the Communist radio station launched a fierce attack on the conflict between university students and officers of the Garrison Headquarters Reception Headquarters in Nanjing, denouncing the incident as "the Nationalist reactionary government's continued implementation of the counter-revolutionary war policy under the guise of a peace conspiracy." At the same time, it pointed out that the beating of the students was carried out by pre-positioned National Army personnel and "secret agents."</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Deposits or Currency Exchange?</h3>
<p>— Jiang Guoyan</p>
<p>(1) Distinguishing Names from Reality</p>
<p>The whiteness of a white horse is not the whiteness of white snow. In academia, this is the distinction between names and reality. In practical application, it concerns gains and losses. The distinction between names and reality can sometimes be ignored, but gains and losses cannot. Although equal-value deposits and silver dollar deposits differ only slightly in form, their actual consequences are diametrically opposed. A debate is necessary.</p>
<p>Advocates of silver dollar deposits divide deposit methods into: (1) depositing silver and returning silver, that is, both receipts and payments are in kind, which can be said to be the orthodox school; (2) depositing notes and returning notes, which, to be accurate, should be "depositing value and returning value," where both receipts and payments are nominal, which is what people now advocate as "equal-value deposits," and should not be mistakenly categorized here; (3) depositing notes and returning silver, which is receiving nominal and returning real. Proponents have already deemed depositing silver and returning silver to be of little significance in the current monetary situation and should be postponed. Now, let's discuss depositing notes and returning silver.</p>
<p>(2) Not Deposits, but Currency Exchange</p>
<p>Depositing notes and returning silver inherently falls into the error of using material goods to entice currency recall. It violates the purpose of the financial industry, which focuses on currency. Because silver dollars currently only have commodity value and not monetary function. It is currency exchange, not deposits. Its success or failure can be learned from currency exchange policies.</p>
<p>Depositing notes and returning silver is premised on protecting people's savings and purchasing power. It should be known that protection should be under certain conditions. Once these conditions disappear, protection should also end. Protecting savings and purchasing power should be done before continuous savings and the act of purchasing goods. Once a note is deposited for silver, the condition of the deposit has disappeared, but its protection continues forever. This is very different from equal-value deposits, where the guarantee ends immediately after withdrawal. Therefore, it is the protection of material goods.</p>
<p>This type of deposit is based on market prices, which is naturally more flexible than the so-called balancing fee ultimately used in currency exchange policies. However, it is an inevitable fact that listed prices and market prices can never match at all times. Especially during inflation, the faster the inflation, the more the market price will fluctuate. After the gold and silver market opens, the market price of silver dollars may change several times in an instant. The listed price can never be changed every minute or second. Even if the listed price is changed three or four times a day, there will inevitably be times of difference. It is not difficult to use this difference for profit. For example, Mr. A deposits one million Gold Yuan notes at 9:00 am according to the listed price of 5,000 to one as a current deposit. According to regulations, he can obtain 200 silver dollars at any time. If the difference between the market price and the listed price is only slightly 50 or 25 yuan, then selling 200 silver dollars and depositing them again can yield a profit of one or two silver dollars. This is protecting speculative power, not savings or purchasing power. At least several cycles can be made in a day. If one person does this, thousands or hundreds of people can also do this. Even if silver dollars are unlimited, the receiving and paying bank will be unable to cope. The result is imaginable whether it is the same as the bank run during the currency exchange policy. The listed price, due to the convenience of depositing and withdrawing, has lost its function of restricting profitable behavior. "Deposits" then become "currency exchange."</p>
<p>The most important thing is currency recall. The government has repeatedly boasted that 20 million US dollars can recover all currency. We might as well go further and assume that all of the government's silver dollars can recover four times or more of the current total currency. As a result of depositing notes and returning silver, the first currency recall loses one-quarter of the silver dollars. Subsequently, the pressure of the deficit causes the Gold Yuan notes to be issued again. The second time, another quarter of the silver dollars are taken back. If this continues to the fourth time, all the silver dollars will be lost, and the fifth issuance of Gold Yuan notes will have nothing to rely on, and it will inevitably be forced to stop returning silver. Deposits also disappear due to the disappearance of the temptation. May I ask what is the difference from suspension of exchange? Moreover, the government has absolutely no such large amount of silver dollars, so it is currency exchange, not deposits.</p>
<p>The government's currency exchange policy was originally intended to maintain monetary confidence and inform the people. From unlimited to limited, to adding a "balancing fee," it finally led to suspension of exchange. On the surface, it is said that the disparity between the currency exchange price and the market price gives profiteers an opportunity to exploit. However, the reason why the currency exchange price and the market price differ is due to restrictions. Restrictions are the cause of black market soaring, not its result. Why must we plant this evil cause and eat this evil fruit? In a word, limited inventory cannot withstand unlimited issuance. Is the inevitable failure of the currency exchange policy necessarily known only after a bank run? Even a currency exchange policy with limitations is still like this. Deposits with absolutely no limitations, its success or failure can also be predicted. Depositing notes and returning silver is virtually no different from currency exchange except in wording. It can be called the second currency exchange policy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the handling of this deposit, it is said that it is appropriate for banks to handle freely. But since the deposit is in Gold Yuan notes, where will the returned silver dollars come from? If supplied by the Central Bank, the Central Bank, in addition to the loss of silver dollars, should also be responsible for the interest on the remaining balance of the bank. The use of deposits then falls into the hands of the bank. For the bank, it can be said to be foolproof. But to use the national treasury for the profit of a few people, how can it be fair to the general public?</p>
<p>The above are the inherent defects in the principle of "depositing notes and returning silver," and its success or failure can already be predicted. Let's go further and examine the consequences it gives to the national economy.</p>
<p>(3) Consequences of Silver Dollar Deposits</p>
<p>How depositing notes and returning silver will be used, the commentators have not explained. If it is issuing notes and returning notes, then it is not a silver dollar deposit, as mentioned earlier. If it is issuing silver and returning notes or issuing notes and returning silver, then creditors and debtors will inevitably be dissatisfied. Now, let's assume that it is issuing silver and returning silver, the same as depositing silver and returning silver.</p>
<p>If the bank does not use silver dollars, then the silver dollars will not yield any income and must lose storage fees, that is, it is purely a commodity and not currency. But the bank will not be disheartened and must lose the interest paid, so it must undoubtedly restore the monetary function of silver dollars. If the government does not give it legal tender status in advance, the borrower can refuse to repay in silver dollars at any time. Therefore, in order to obtain legal protection, the bank, although it does not have to force the government to stop issuing Gold Yuan notes, must force the government to recognize the legal tender status of silver dollars. Silver dollars then seize the throne of the standard, and industry, commerce, and the entire public have no choice but to receive and pay in silver dollars. Thus, except for odd amounts below the yuan, the Gold Yuan note is forced to retreat from the industrial sector and the doors of those above the middle class, and is reduced to the currency of the poor who cannot use the yuan as a unit for each receipt and payment. What will be the result?</p>
<p>Before the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, although the silver dollar was the standard currency for receipts and payments, there were foreign taels above it, and silver dimes and copper coins as subsidiary currencies below it. At that time, the subtle connection between the circulation of foreign taels and the value of silver dollars should still be remembered by people. However, since foreign taels were nominal and only the currency of a very small number of comprador classes, and there was free arbitrage to regulate it, its advantages and disadvantages were generally ignored. And copper coins as change often posed a great threat to the lower and middle classes in large cities, especially Shanghai. This fact should also still be remembered by people. At that time, if one could manipulate the exchange rate between copper coins and silver dollars, it would be like holding the most convenient weapon of exploitation. The silver dimes and copper coins earned by coolie laborers in the morning and afternoon were exchanged for silver dollars in the evening, whether for savings or for the purpose of purchasing things worth more than one yuan, they could not help but suffer a loss of value invisibly. Silver dimes and copper coins with commodity prices were already like this, let alone banknotes that are inflating daily. Its harm must be even greater. After the issuance of large banknotes, small banknotes have caused great harm to the poor, let alone silver dollars. Therefore, the result of silver dollar deposits will inevitably cause endless persecution to the poor, unless the inflating currency is abandoned first.</p>
<p>The permission to circulate and trade silver dollars was already stipulated not to be prohibited on November 12 last year. On February 26, there was even the following encouragement. However, from the era of legal tender until now, except for places that rely on regional political power for support, it has always regarded itself as a commodity and has not restored its monetary nature. That is, there is the act of buying and selling, but there is no phenomenon of circulation. The crux of this is worth pondering. Today's people oppose the government's explicit use of silver dollars for this reason. It is also said that there is no need to prohibit it because it is a commodity and not currency.</p>
<p>(4) Conclusion</p>
<p>In short, for any policy to stabilize the current monetary value, it should be known: (1) The government is a Necessary evil. We have the right to choose each other, but not to abandon it, that is, we must have something to support it. (2) The consequences of the policy should be seen through, so that it does not persecute the masses and be used by a few or special classes.</p>
<p>As an aside, using customs gold units or silver dollars as a denomination, as long as Gold Yuan notes are not rejected for receipts and payments, there is no need to oppose or prohibit it. Prices that are too high are not the fault of the unit of account. If US dollars or Hong Kong dollars are used as denominations, it should be absolutely prohibited. That is the dignity of the nation, it is political rather than economic. If the government strongly prohibits using customs gold units or silver dollars as a denomination in the name of disrupting the monetary system, it will not only be ridiculed for lighting a lamp to start a fire, but will also commit suicide and lose credibility.

<h3>The CCP Strengthens the "Bamboo Curtain" in Peiping and Tianjin to Rebuild University Education; 3,000 University Students are Confined to Concentration Camps for Re-education; "I Chose Freedom" is Confiscated</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd] A famous Chinese professor, who recently arrived here from North China, said on the 2nd that the CCP is gradually strengthening its "bamboo curtain" in Peiping and Tianjin. This famous professor has no political affiliation and is an absolutely neutral person. He asked reporters not to publish his surname for the sake of the safety of his family still in Peiping.</p>
<p>He said that the initial goals of the CCP in sovietizing Peiping and Tianjin are to control the press, rebuild university education, and squeeze out unwelcome foreigners. He said that the CCP has now completed its first goal and turned its attention to rebuilding university education, trying to make the universities comply with communism, and forcing foreigners to leave, but Soviet citizens are clearly not included among the unwelcome foreigners. Soviet citizens in Peiping and Tianjin enjoy full freedom of movement. The CCP allowed the use of their vehicles from the day it occupied Peiping and Tianjin. He said that he personally saw Soviet technicians serving on the Peiping-Tianjin Railway. At the same time, according to two students who had returned to Peiping after visiting their hometowns in the Northeast, the stationmasters of all stations on the Chinese Eastern Railway are Soviets, and there are Soviet guards stationed at each station.</p>
<p>The CCP is discussing the reconstruction of university education with so-called democratic professors. The current restrictions placed on university courses are: (1) Prohibiting the teaching of Roman law; (2) Changing social science courses to "study sessions" to discuss communism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong's New Democracy. Natural science courses are allowed to be taught as usual; (3) Anti-communist books have been removed from the libraries of all schools. Kravchenko's "I Chose Freedom" is particularly opposed by the CCP, and even the books in bookstores have been confiscated.</p>
<p>In addition, the CCP has concentrated 3,000 university students who are suspected of being spies or members of the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People Youth League, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party in a large-scale concentration camp inside Deshengmen for re-education. At the same time, the CCP has launched a movement to encourage students to abandon education and join the army or engage in propaganda work.</p>
<p>The CCP has also established four universities with four-month courses, where even students with only elementary school education can enroll. These four universities are North China University, North China People's Revolutionary University, North China Political and Military University, and the Southward Work Personnel Training Academy. The academy aims to train political and administrative personnel to prepare for the takeover of South China.</p>
<h3>Peiping and Tianjin Students Fight for Freedom; More Than a Thousand Refugees Flee to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 2nd] Since the CCP occupied Peiping and Tianjin, a large number of students have fled south. According to the Youth Re-enrollment Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Education here, since the Communist Party ruled Peiping and Tianjin, more than 1,000 students from schools such as Normal University, Dong University, Zhong University, and Chang University have fled to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Returned Soldiers from Communist Areas Stranded in Qingdao Continue to be Sent South</h3>
<p>Authorities Will Stop Receiving Them in the Future</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 2nd] There are still more than 10,000 returned soldiers from the Communist areas stranded in Qingdao. They were once temporarily suspended from being sent south, but now, under the order of the Ministry of National Defense, they continue to be sent south. According to reliable sources, senior military authorities intend to stop receiving returned soldiers. The front line remains strictly blocked, and a telegram has been sent to Chief of Staff Gu for consideration.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Sea Fishing Season is Approaching; Provincial Government Loans Rice to Fishermen</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 2nd] The Zhejiang sea fishing season is approaching, and fishermen are unable to fish due to lack of funds, which not only affects the livelihoods of fishermen but also concerns the security of the coastal areas. The provincial government has ordered the use of one-third of the provincial grain and two-thirds of the county grain to lend to fishermen directly engaged in production, totaling 13,669 shi of rice, of which Ningzhou accounts for 45%, Wenzhou 30%, and Taizhou 25%. At the same time, the province is still borrowing 50,000 shi of rice from the Central Agricultural Bank for fishing loans.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Defense Bureau Abolished</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 2nd] Chairman Chen recently issued an order to abolish the Taiwan Provincial Defense Bureau at the end of April, and personnel will be dismissed. The bureau was established by former Chairman Wei as an anti-smuggling agency.</p>
<h3>After the Conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement, a Large Number of Raw Materials Will Be Shipped to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, this city] Reliable sources say that after the conclusion of the new Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement, a large number of raw materials from the western and northwestern provinces of China will flow to the Soviet Union. The draft of the new Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement, negotiated in Dihua, has been completed and is now being reviewed by Nanjing and Moscow. The terms of the agreement have not yet been announced, and the content has not been revealed. The source said that, in general, the new Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement stipulates the extension of the Sino-Soviet 25-year aviation agreement. According to the aviation agreement, the Soviet Union can exclusively occupy commercial aviation rights between Xinjiang and the Soviet Union. It also stipulates that the Soviet land trade routes will extend further into the eastern and southeastern regions, so that cotton, agricultural products, minerals, and other raw materials can be transported to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Informed sources said that the issue of granting the Soviet Union the rights to mine, reclaim, and explore for oil was not included in the drafting of the treaty. The previous rumor was incorrect. The source also said that the Soviet Union also made some concessions to China, allowing China to open up the borders between the western and northwestern regions of China and the Soviet Union. Currently, the Sino-Soviet border in that area is closed to trade.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan Attends a Meeting and Delivers a Speech in Wuxing: There is Only One Way to Peace: Ceasefire and Divide the Country for Political Competition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxing, 31st] Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and his wife returned to Huzhou on March 30 to sweep the tombs. On March 31, at the invitation of the 9th Session of the 1st Wuxing County Council, he attended and delivered a speech, generally saying: "Wuxing is relatively stable at present and is a land of peace and purity." He believes that "everything here is still quite stable, which is really not easy." He continued, "Now the people's suffering is deep, at least there are unsatisfactory places. I hope that public opinion organs will give full play and do not avoid speaking out. However, for small matters, we should look at the big environment. If there is a change in the big environment, the small scope will definitely be affected." Therefore, he contributed his views on the big environment: "So far, the government has made no preparations for the peace talks plan. This time, the peace talks representatives flew to Peiping, and the government authorized the representatives to let them manage all the people's future lives, systems, and thoughts, which is really very dangerous." He also analyzed that if this peace talk is not successful, there are only two ways: one is that the discussion hits a snag at any point, so the peace talk is shelved, and then there is fighting; the other is that while the meeting is going on, the cannons are firing, so there is no interest in talking anymore, and there is still fighting. He continued, "The most important issue in the peace talks is the coalition government. If the government agrees, this is extremely dangerous, because the Soviet Union hopes to use the relationship with the CCP to pull China into their camp. Once a coalition government is formed, the CCP can control the whole country like the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia, and lean towards the Soviet Union, and use China as a gambling chip for war. The United States has 140 million people. If half of the Chinese die, there are still 200 million. The Soviet Union can train the Chinese people and immediately launch a war. At that time, it will not be just one or two battles in the Yangtze River. The blood of young people will not flow for the country, but for the Soviet Union. Therefore, a peace chosen out of desperation is not a truly permanent peace." He pointed out that the only way out is: "The people must all rise up, take care of the vitality of the country, and demand a ceasefire on both sides, divide the country for political competition, and let's have a political competition to see under which ideology the people can have faith? But there must be strength to let the CCP know that it cannot cross the river, so that the country can be divided for political competition. Therefore, the Yangtze River maintains half of the country and also determines the fate of China." Finally, he said: "If the Yangtze River can be defended for three months to a year, China still has hope, and it can avoid a great catastrophe. If this bit of strength cannot be exerted, then we can only let the CCP slaughter us. At that time, we will not be able to speak, not be able to be angry, not be able to hate, and it will be too late to regret it. So I want to find a way to contribute in the last five minutes," he said.</p>

All American employees of the ECA have withdrawn from the Communist Party's jurisdiction in North China, and none of them have been harmed. To his knowledge, all employees have been treated well. The food, flour, and cotton abandoned by the ECA are worth about US$4 million. All the evacuated employees have reported to the Shanghai Mission, and will continue to work there or be transferred elsewhere.

<h3>On the Eve of the Atlantic Pact Signing, Foreign Ministers of Twelve Nations Meet to Finalize the Clauses of the Alliance; Acheson Convenes U.S. Representatives to the UN General Assembly to Instruct Them on Strategy</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Washington, 2nd, broadcast: The foreign ministers of the twelve nations participating in the North Atlantic Treaty met today to prepare for the final approval of the full text of the treaty, to complete the procedures before signing. The United States was represented by Acheson and State Department advisor Bohlen. Today, Acheson also convened all members of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly for a full day of discussion, instructing them on strategy for the meeting. Acheson expects the Soviet Union to launch a full-scale attack on the North Atlantic Treaty during the General Assembly. Today, the twelve foreign ministers also exchanged views on the establishment of a joint defense mechanism, as the treaty stipulates that a permanent consultative committee and various subsidiary groups must be organized immediately.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The foreign ministers of the twelve nations of the Atlantic Pact met here today for a final discussion before signing, including the establishment of permanent institutions to implement the treaty, such as the Atlantic Pact Committee, the Defense Committee, and the Secretariat. Representatives from Italy, Portugal, Denmark, and Iceland met for the first time with representatives from the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Norway. Because the treaty will be signed on Monday and the General Assembly will open on Tuesday, the State Department will remain open as usual on the weekend. The General Assembly will open with an address by Chairman Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The foreign ministers of the twelve nations are scheduled to sign the North Atlantic Treaty at 10 p.m. (standard time) on the 4th in the U.S. State Department Auditorium, with a brief speech by Secretary of State Acheson.

Each foreign minister will deliver a brief speech during the signing, limited to five minutes each. Finally, President Truman will enter the auditorium and deliver a speech of ten to fifteen minutes, completing the signing ceremony.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Well-informed sources said today that the organization of the joint institutions of the signatory countries after the signing of the Atlantic Treaty will require lengthy discussion, lasting at least several weeks or even months, as the U.S. Senate's approval of the treaty will take considerable time. The location of the headquarters of the Atlantic Alliance will likely be in London or Paris.</p>
<p>[United Press, Dublin, 2nd] Irish Foreign Minister MacBride boarded the "Washington" liner today to go to the United States to discuss the Atlantic Treaty with Secretary of State Acheson.

<p>[This Newspaper News] Washington, 2nd, broadcast: Bevin discussed the West German question with French Ambassador Henri Bonnet, advocating the establishment of a government as soon as possible, as further delay would give the Communist Party an opportunity to expand its influence. Bevin will meet with Acheson at the State Department this afternoon.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st] A U.S. State Department spokesman said that French Foreign Minister Schuman had a 90-minute secret talk with U.S. Secretary of State Acheson yesterday, frankly exchanging views on the West German question.

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] British Foreign Secretary Bevin recently delivered a speech to the Washington Press Association, stating that Britain's partnership with the people of Asia would help the North Atlantic nations protect the world from aggression by totalitarian forces.

He particularly pointed out that Britain's greatest action in history was granting freedom to India and Pakistan, and that Asia's enjoyment of parliamentary systems and free thought today is mostly due to Britain.</p>
<h3>Churchill Holds Press Conference Before Leaving America</h3>
<p>Willing to Study the Pacific Pact</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] New York, 2nd, broadcast: Churchill held a press conference on the Queen Mary liner today before leaving. He said that he earnestly wished that Western countries could become good friends with the Soviet people. The Soviet army fought bravely in the Great War, but unfortunately, their government led them to their current position. If the Soviet Union could open its borders so that people from other countries could enter and exit freely, the situation would be very different. Churchill also said that the idea of concluding a Pacific Pact should be studied, but we cannot inappropriately disperse resources.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Boston, 1st] The president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology today asked Churchill to accept the university's honorary degree before 14,000 people. The president called Churchill a "warrior, statesman, student, and maker of history."</p>
<h3>Soviets Actively Mining Uranium in Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 2nd] According to people traveling from the Soviet-occupied zone this morning, the Soviet Union is currently mining uranium in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.

It is also said that the entire mining area is about 20 kilometers long, located at the foot of the Ore Mountains on the Bavarian border. The area has been completely sealed off by the Soviet Union. Most of the residents of the Oelsnitz area have been conscripted to work in the uranium mine.</p>
<h3>Japanese Class B and C War Criminals Should Be Tried by September</h3>

<h3>The Atlantic Pact is a Bulwark for Peace The U.S., Britain, and France Reject Soviet Protests The Next Soviet Action May Be to Tear Up Treaties with Britain and France</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Diplomatic observers here believe that the Soviet Union's protest note on the Atlantic Pact, which states that the conclusion of the treaty violates treaties signed by the treaty countries with the Soviet Union, is intended to prepare for the declaration that all previous treaties signed by the Soviet Union with the treaty countries are invalid. The protest also states that the Atlantic Pact violates the United Nations Charter, indicating that the Soviet Union will raise the issue of the Atlantic Pact at this session of the General Assembly. The Anglo-Soviet Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship was signed in London in 1942, and the Franco-Soviet Treaty was signed in Moscow in 1944, both stipulating that "each signatory shall not enter into an alliance with other countries or participate in any alliance against the other signatory."</p>
<p>Two Meanings of the Western Alliance</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] Spokesmen for the U.S., Britain, and France coldly refuted the Soviet Union's protest that the Atlantic Treaty was aggressive, asserting that the treaty was a bulwark for peace. British Foreign Secretary Bevin said that the Atlantic Treaty may be the greatest factor contributing to world peace. The treaty has two meanings: first, a permanent solution to future peace must be decided in the next year; second, the treaty will combine manpower, military assistance, and economic assistance into one.</p>
<p>No Fear of Aggression</p>
<p>A U.S. State Department spokesman said that the treaty was purely defensive in nature, and that Moscow could prevent the defense measures under the Atlantic Pact from being implemented simply by not attacking anyone, as Article 5 of the treaty stipulates that the treaty countries will only take collective self-defense action when a treaty country is subjected to armed attack. Most of the Soviet Union's protest is for propaganda purposes, and the State Department has not yet decided whether to formally respond. Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that if the Soviet Union does not intend to launch an armed attack, the treaty will not harm the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>U.S. Extends Lease on Saudi Arabian Air Force Base New Agreement to Be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st] Well-informed sources say that a new agreement between the United States and Saudi Arabia on the large air force base in Dhahran will be announced soon. In the previous agreement, the U.S. Air Force had complete control of the base from 1946 to 1949. The recent negotiations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are related to revising and extending the validity of the agreement, which will expire on March 15 this year. Well-informed sources said that the new agreement will stipulate that U.S. civilian airlines will also have broad rights to use the Dhahran airport.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Criticizes Western Alliance Calling it a Black Pact</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 1st] Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg published an article in the "Life and Culture" weekly today, denouncing the Atlantic Pact as a "black pact." He said that no matter what attitude the governments take, the people of Europe will never approve the black pact. Congressional approval is one thing, and the people's approval is another. Others can buy off a certain Italian senator or intimidate a certain Danish congressman, but the people can never be bought off. The people of Europe will never approve this aggressive pact, because they do not want their traditional culture to be destroyed due to the mistakes of thousands of merchants who want to get rich through war. Ehrenburg continued, "War vendors can issue orders, but they lack troops, because the people refuse to fight. The world has been divided into two major camps, namely builders and destroyers, defenders of peace and supporters of war. France, Italy, and Britain themselves are also divided into two, and the United States is also encountering the same situation, with domestic supporters of peace launching an offensive."</p>
<h3>Some U.S. Congressmen Advocate U.S.-Soviet Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] One of the most influential members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Democrat Mansfield, said that he knew that several members of Congress had suggested to Truman the possibility of starting U.S.-Soviet peace talks after the completion of the Atlantic Pact. Mansfield said, "The purpose of these talks is clearly to reach an agreement that all parties can fulfill, in order to lay the foundation for world peace." Some diplomats here have long believed that Western countries will try again at the appropriate time to persuade the Soviet Union to take a more conciliatory attitude towards them in order to end the "Cold War." They believe that the situation has reached a balance because the Western European recovery plan is gradually progressing and security has been improved by the conclusion of the Atlantic Pact. Under these circumstances, Western countries can negotiate with the Soviet Union on an equal footing, but the State Department has no indication of any such plan.</p>

<h3>Southeast Asian Countries Support Australian-Indian Proposal</h3>
<p>To Place the Indonesian Question on the UN General Assembly Agenda</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] According to well-informed sources, the joint proposal of Australia and India has received the support of the nineteen countries that participated in the Southeast Asian Conference in January this year. These countries are all members of the United Nations and can participate in the UN General Assembly debates.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 1st] The Dutch and British delegations are quite supportive of the Australian and Indian proposal to discuss the Indonesian question at the United Nations General Assembly to be convened on April 4. On the other hand, the Indonesian representatives welcomed the Australian and Indian proposal. British and Dutch representatives in Lake Success privately believe that it is unfortunate that the United Nations is discussing the Indonesian question at a time when Indonesia and the Netherlands are about to begin preliminary negotiations.</p>
<h3>Burmese Government Uncovers Another Coup Plot</h3>
<p>Recapture of Mandalay Delayed As a Result</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 1st] Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu revealed in a radio address today that the government has uncovered a plot by a certain political party in northern Burma to attack the government when government forces launch a counterattack on Mandalay. Therefore, the government forces' plan to recapture Mandalay had to be delayed. The political party planned to seize Katha, Monywa, Shwebo, Sagaing, and other places in northern Burma. The situation in northern Burma is now completely under government control.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to an announcement by the Burmese government, government forces launched a counterattack on the Mandalay front and recaptured Wetwun, an important base of the Karen rebels. The Burmese Air Force bombed the Karen rebel base of Taikkyi, 100 miles south of Mandalay, with most of the bombs hitting their targets directly.</p>
<h3>Stetson Advocates Allocating $10 Billion to Promote MacArthur's Aid-to-Asia Plan Take Swift Action to Reverse the Reddening of China Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Boston, 1st] Stetson, who participated in the Republican presidential nomination race last year, delivered a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology today, calling for swift action to revitalize the un-reddened half of China. Stetson also advocated launching a MacArthur Plan to aid Asia in eradicating communism, allocating $10 billion annually for aid to Asia. Stetson exclaimed, "Standing idly by and withdrawing aid is tantamount to assisting the Communist Party in ruling China, which is extremely foolish. We should take into account the needs of Europe and our own economic capabilities, but we should also regularly use a portion of our resources in Asia to resist communism. This amount should be at least $10 billion per year. This aid-to-Asia plan should be used to support indigenous and private plans in Asian countries, rather than being used by any central government. The Marshall Plan is the most important and most righteous thing we have done since the end of the war. We should now launch a similar MacArthur Plan in Asia. This plan should have a long-term vision, be continuously implemented, have the same implementation details as the Marshall Plan, and have the same goals. At the same time, it should also require the recipient countries to engage in self-help, as with the Marshall Plan. The only concern of Soviet aggression is the strength to resist such aggression. The Soviet Union believes that some people will eventually implement military rule, so from their point of view, it is better for them to rule by force. Therefore, unless influenced by internal or external pressure, they will not automatically give others strength, give human rights, or give freedom. If we link this inevitable situation with the special question we face, we have to believe that our standing idly by, withdrawing aid, and thus assisting the Communist Party in ruling China is extremely foolish. We must act quickly to revitalize the remaining half of China." Stetson also suggested using balloons and high-altitude aircraft to spread anti-communist propaganda. Stetson is currently the president of Bennington College.</p>
<p>[United Press, Boston, 2nd] Stetson's speech emphasized aid to southern China, which resonated with Republican Senator Flint. It is said, "I fear we are already a bit behind. A year ago, I proposed to former Secretary of State Marshall that we do something in the Yangtze River basin and southern China, just as the Marshall Plan did in Europe. Abandoning northern China is sound economics, but I don't know if we can still do this now."</p>
<h3>France Increases Aid to Vietnam</h3>
<p>And Reviews Tactics for Suppressing the Viet Minh</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] The People's Republican Movement newspaper L'Aube reported today that the French government has decided to send new reinforcements to Vietnam and to review whether it is possible to modify the tactics for suppressing the Viet Minh army. The newspaper said that the two decisions were passed by the Supreme National Defense Committee on the 28th. The first decision is to immediately send reinforcements of about ten battalions to Vietnam, with the reinforcements carrying about 500 various tanks and some fighter planes. The second decision, according to L'Aube, is to send the Chief of the Defense Staff, Revers, to Vietnam to personally inspect the situation and decide whether the current military tactics should be changed, especially the tactic of reducing the size of French units and stationing them in various areas. L'Aube also said that the French cabinet meeting also decided to instruct French Foreign Minister Schuman, who is currently visiting Washington, to urge U.S. officials to pay attention to the great military and diplomatic significance of the Vietnam situation.</p>
<h3>Britain and the U.S. Lodge Strong Protests Against Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria for Depriving Human Rights Condemning them for Violating Treaty Clauses</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The British government issued protest notes to Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria today, pointing out that they violated the clauses in the treaties regarding respect for human rights and demanding that they take remedial action immediately. The notes cited the imprisonment of Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty, the arrest of Hungarian Christian Bishop Ordass, the imprisonment of Romanian Peasant Party leader Maniu, and the execution of Bulgarian opposition leader Petkov as examples to prove that the three countries systematically suppressed the freedom of speech, association, and religious activity of the parliamentary opposition. At the same time, U.S. envoys in the three countries took similar action this morning. Diplomatic circles believe that unless Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria provide satisfactory answers to Britain and the U.S., Britain and the U.S. will invoke the treaty clauses as signatories to the treaty and convene a meeting of the chief diplomatic representatives of Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union stationed in each of these countries to discuss the actions that should be taken.</p>
<h3>Small Car Can Be Folded Into a Suitcase Shape</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] The press here today visited a very small car that can be folded. With the help of a kind of hinge, the car can be folded to a width of only 70 cm, so the car only needs a very small garage. The car is equipped with a one-and-a-half horsepower engine and can carry two people.</p>
<h3>Republicans Demand Cuts in Aid to Europe The U.S. Senate Rejects It Hoffman Vigorously Argues to Maintain the Original Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] After overcoming efforts to cut the cost of the European Recovery Program, the Senate prepared on the 2nd to quickly pass the second phase of the Marshall Plan, totaling $5.58 billion. However, although the Senate's approval of extending aid to Europe seemed inevitable, the recovery plan would be temporarily shelved, because the authority to allocate funds for the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) would end at midnight on the 2nd, and the House would not submit this bill until next week.</p>
<p>The Senate may be forced to make a final decision on extending aid to Europe by early next week. Democratic leader Lucas called for the Senate to hold an emergency weekend meeting to accelerate the final decision. The Senate rejected Republican leader Wherry's proposal to reduce the aid to Europe requested by the government by 15% over the next 15 months by a vote of 68 to 14, thanks to the strong force exerted by the bipartisan foreign policy. The Senate also rejected Republican leaders Taft and Russell's amendment to reduce aid to Europe by $543 million (about 10% of the total) by a vote of 54 to 23. Before the vote, a letter of appeal from ECA Administrator Hoffman to the Senate was read. In the letter, Hoffman stated that cutting aid to Europe would make the industrial recovery plan a "relief plan." In the end, Hoffman hinted that he might resign if the ECA's funds were significantly reduced. At the same time, Hoffman told the press that, for practical reasons, the ECA would temporarily cease operations this weekend, but the ECA supplies currently being shipped were ordered three months ago, so a slight delay in Congress's action on the ECA's authorization bill would not interrupt the recovery supplies being shipped to Europe.</p>

<h3>Industrial Association Holds Board Meeting Yesterday: Discussing Steps for North-South Trade; Representatives Sent to Beijing, including Pan Shihao, Report on the Petition Process; Decision to Telegraph Mao Zedong, Li Shucheng, et al., Hoping for Support and Facilitation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Industrial Association held a board of directors and supervisors meeting yesterday afternoon to hear reports from the seven representatives, including Liu Hongsheng, Hu Xiyuan, and Pan Shihao, who returned from petitioning the government regarding North-South trade issues. Jin Runxiang chaired the meeting. First, Representative Pan Shihao reported on the petitioning process in Beijing, stating briefly: Those met in Beijing included Premier of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun, and Minister of Economic Affairs Sun Yueqi. The representatives presented three points to the leaders: (1) Shanghai's industrial production is the leading in the country, but sales to North China account for a significant portion, and a portion of raw materials also comes from North China, so the exchange of North-South assets is extremely important. (2) Tianjin has already established trade with Hong Kong. Although the area has raw materials shipped to Hong Kong, they cannot be transferred to Shanghai, so raw materials and supplies from North China should be directly shipped to Shanghai via Tianjin. (3) If industrial products cannot be sold to the North, it will cause factories to shut down, and the livelihoods of millions of workers will become a problem. Premier He and Ministers Liu and Sun expressed sympathy for the situation of the industrial sector and attached great importance to the exchange of materials, but considering that the peace talks were still in the initial stages, they needed to wait for some results before further discussion. The representatives believed that if the peace talks succeed, North-South trade is inevitable, but currently, it must proceed simultaneously with the peace talks to achieve the exchange of materials as soon as possible, so that industrial products can be sold to the North early. Premier He asked the representatives to wait for a week before further discussion, to observe the outcome of the peace talks in Peiping. The representatives returned to Shanghai to report. Later, Hu Xiyuan and others supplemented the report. After discussion, three resolutions were made: (1) Telegraph Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, requesting support for the exchange of North-South materials. (2) Telegraph Li Shucheng and others in the North China business community, hoping that they would facilitate the matter. (3) A. Issues such as the methods of selling industrial products to the North will be studied by the Transportation and Sales Research Subcommittee. B. The types and trademarks of industrial products sold to the North will be investigated immediately by the Technical Committee.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, Liu Gongyun, the Governor of the Central Bank, specifically notified Du Yuesheng, the Chairman of the Industrial Association, by telephone regarding the North-South material exchange issue, requesting the appointment of representatives to meet at the Central Bank to discuss relevant issues.</p>
<h3>Three Groups Jointly Telegraph the Communist Side: Requesting a Cessation of Military Action; Any Dispute Can Be Resolved at the Peace Talks</h3>
<p>The National Shipping Industry Association, the Industrial Association, and three other organizations, in light of the fact that the Nationalists and Communists have begun their peace talks but cannon fire continues on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, and in order to protect the safety of navigation, yesterday (the 2nd) jointly telegraphed the Chinese Communist Party, requesting a cessation of all military actions to facilitate peace talks. The original text is as follows: Respected Mr. Mao Zedong of Peiping, We note that war destroys transportation, hinders construction, and is cursed by all people. For more than ten years, industry, commerce, and shipping have suffered greatly from the ravages of war, and we deeply regret this. Now that peace talks have begun, looking north to Yanling, we are filled with joy. However, although the Nationalist army has been retreating and has long ceased fighting, the Communist army north of the Yangtze River is still frequently mobilized and is fiercely attacking Anqing, Yizheng, and other places, actively preparing to cross the river. This not only hinders peace talks but also endangers the safety of shipping on the Yangtze River. The impact of this situation will inevitably plunge production into despair and halt shipping, causing thousands of people in industry, commerce, and shipping to suffer from hunger and unemployment, which causes us great anxiety. We believe that in this day and age, any dispute between the two sides can be openly discussed and a comprehensive and thorough solution can be sought at the peace talks. We specifically telegraph you, earnestly requesting you to immediately order the troops north of the Yangtze River to cease all military actions to maintain the safety of shipping and facilitate the progress of the peace talks. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your consideration. National Shipping Industry Association, Shanghai Industrial Association, Shanghai Shipping Industry Guild, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Tangshan Vessel Arrives in Shanghai from Qinhuangdao: Carrying Over Six Thousand Tons of Coal; Yongxing and Taian Expected to Arrive Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Reports of coal shipments from Qinhuangdao continuously arriving in Shanghai have been published in this newspaper. We now know that the Tangshan vessel of the China Shipping Company, carrying six thousand seven hundred tons of coal and a small amount of mail from Qinhuangdao, arrived in Shanghai at 2 PM yesterday and is currently docked at the Kailuan Wharf for unloading.

<h3>Rice Market Transactions: Futures Trading Prohibited</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the North-South rice market experienced an unprecedented price surge. The price of white rice for next-day futures trading (today is Sunday; with the Tomb Sweeping Festival on the 4th and 5th, the market is closed, adding three days of interest) reached 160,000 yuan per shi. Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau paid close attention to this issue and immediately ordered that futures trading be prohibited in the market to avoid stimulating other commodity prices. Therefore, the price of cash transactions on the same day in the market was only around 120,000 yuan per shi. The Social Affairs Bureau also scheduled a meeting with the Rice Merchants Association and the heads of the North-South markets on the afternoon of the 5th to discuss ways to stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>Families of Detained Lixin Teachers and Students: Renewed Request for Release</h3>
<p>After thirty-one teachers and students from Lixin Accounting School, including Huangpu and Han Ziliang, were arrested in late October last year, four of them have been released on bail, but twenty-seven are still in detention. The families of those arrested petitioned the Municipal Government yesterday morning, stating that their family members have been detained for five months without being sentenced. On April 1st, it was reported that the Executive Yuan had passed a resolution that all undecided political prisoners should be released unconditionally, which provides a legal basis. Therefore, they requested the Municipal Government to forward their request to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to release the arrested teachers and students as soon as possible. Commissioner Ding of the Municipal Government received them and promised to forward the request.</p>

<h3>"Sea Fox" Iron Barge Drifts Away: China Merchants Bureau Sends Vessel to Search</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On March 29th, the China Merchants Bureau's Min 105 tugboat was towing two iron barges, "Sea Fox" and "Sea Dog," fully loaded with timber from the Supplies Bureau, to Kaohsiung. Unexpectedly, when sailing to the sea off Wenzhou at 27.40 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude, the weather suddenly changed, with strong winds and high waves. The towline of the "Sea Fox" broke, and it went missing immediately. Yesterday, the Bureau sent the Min 316 vessel to the site of the incident to search for it. It is reported that there were no personnel on board the iron barge.</p>
<h3>Import-Export Guild Discusses: Appendices Proposed by the Industrial Association</h3>
<p>Since the Industrial Association tentatively drafted appendices for imported goods, sending them to the Import Control Commission for reference and publishing them in newspapers to solicit opinions from the business community, it is now known that the Municipal Import-Export Guild believes that these appendices are closely related to the import-export industry. They convened a meeting on the 1st, attended by over twenty people, including An Shi and Hua Hongtao, who expressed many opinions. They generally agreed that the appendices proposed by the Industrial Association still had room for improvement. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The appendices should only divide goods into two categories: goods permitted for import and goods prohibited for import (including those from other ports). It is difficult to accurately estimate the quantities. If restrictions are based solely on the needs of Shanghai, it will inevitably lead to uneven surpluses and shortages. Therefore, restrictions on imported goods should be based on tariff rates. (3) Since the new plan adopts import-export linkage and open import with self-provided foreign exchange, the restrictions on the qualifications of importers should be immediately lifted. (4) A circular will be sent to all members to solicit opinions on the two categories of goods, restricted imports and prohibited imports, proposed by the Industrial Association for further study. The representatives present at the meeting believed that the current trade regulations have been delayed for too long, leaving merchants without direction, and the administrative authorities should be urged to draft and publish them quickly.</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Plane Returns to Shanghai from Peiping: Bringing the First Batch of Postal Items from the Communist Area</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The postal representatives flew to Peiping on a Civil Aviation plane on the 31st of last month, carrying over ninety bags of mail. It is now known that the same plane returned to Shanghai on the afternoon of April 1st, bringing eight bags of southward-bound airmail, including two bags of airmail letters and two bags of registered airmail for the local area, and two bags each of airmail letters and registered airmail in transit. These letters, mostly mailed in Peiping on March 1st and April 1st, were fully distributed by the Shanghai Post Office on the morning of the 2nd. This is the first large batch of airmail from the Communist area to arrive in Shanghai, and it is hoped that North-South postal delivery will become normal in the future.</p>
<h3>Families of the Victims of the Jiangya Steamer Disaster: Symposium Resolves Three Points</h3>
<p>The families of the victims of the Jiangya steamer disaster held a symposium yesterday and resolved: (1) To request the China Merchants Bureau to announce the true cause of the ship's accident and the survey report of the Japanese sailors. (2) To urge the District Attorney's Office to quickly open a court investigation into the intentional homicide case against shipowner Shen Dacai. (3) Compensation issues for the families of the victims. The above resolutions will be forwarded by the families to the Jiangya Disaster Association to be presented to the China Merchants Bureau and the court.</p>
<h3>Statement by the Taiping Relief Committee: Appeal to Employees of China United Company</h3>
<p>After employees of the China United Company appealed to all sectors of society to protect their jobs and distributed various leaflets, the Taiping Steamer Disaster Relief Committee invited reporters from various newspapers to a press conference at 3 PM on April 2nd and issued the following statement: (1) The company and representatives of the bereaved families had an agreement with witnesses to provide temporary relief to the bereaved families. However, the distribution of rice was stopped after only half of it was given. The bereaved families in Shanghai and Taiwan, due to lack of livelihood, have had cases of suicide by hanging, swallowing gold, and jumping into the sea. (2) No efforts have been made to salvage the bodies and belongings to date. (3) The seizure of the Anlian steamer by the Taiwan court and the provisional disposition of the Hualian steamer by the Shanghai court were both handled in accordance with the law. The claim for compensation for the victims is currently in litigation. The employees of the company have exaggerated the situation, which contains an attempt to influence the fair trial of the court and confuse public opinion. (4) The representatives of the bereaved families in Taiwan and Shanghai have suffered from broken families and extremely difficult lives. For the sake of the living and to seek justice for the dead, they assist the company in handling the aftermath without complaint. The company only provides the staff with a normal daily living, without any excessive enjoyment. However, the company's entire staff of over a hundred people gathered to insult the representatives and interfered with their freedom. Representative Luo Jiping had his clothes torn and suffered physical injuries. Now, the company's employees claim that the representatives insulted them, which is a complete reversal of right and wrong, intending to sow discord and division.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Mediates Two Labor Disputes in Cotton Mills Yesterday: Advance Wages Maintained; Request for Rice Subsidy Denied; Existing Practices Should Be Maintained, New Practices Should Not Be Introduced</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Shen of the Labor Affairs Office of the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives of labor and management in the municipal cotton spinning industry yesterday to mediate labor disputes. The cotton spinning industry has had a practice of borrowing eleven days' wages in advance each month. Recently, due to poor production and sales, the management requested to abolish this practice. In addition, the workers of Zhongfang requested the factory to subsidize three dou of rice per month. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated these two issues as follows: The existing practice of eleven days' advance wages will be maintained; the request for rice subsidies will be rejected as there is no precedent. The principle of mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau for such cases is to maintain the status quo; existing practices should not be abolished casually, and new practices should not be approved rashly, to avoid causing more disputes between labor and management.</p>
<h3>Disputes Over Wage Payments in Promissory Notes: Two Cases Resolved Through Mediation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Labor Affairs Office of the Social Affairs Bureau mediated two disputes yesterday regarding factories paying wages with promissory notes: (1) When paying wages, Lun Chang Yarn Factory paid 20% in cash and 80% in promissory notes. (2) When paying wages, China Watch Factory paid 35,000 yuan in cash and 25,000 yuan in promissory notes. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, both cases were resolved. The principle of mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau is that factories should pay wages mostly in cash and only a small amount in promissory notes.</p>
<h3>Statement by the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the recent practice of factories and businesses issuing promissory notes when paying wages due to the cash shortage, which has led to disputes over discounts, Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau issued a statement yesterday, saying that the promissory notes issued by national banks and bureaus have the same effect as cash and should not be subject to discounts. The Social Affairs Bureau has requested the Municipal Government to inform the municipal military and police agencies to suppress the practice of discounting promissory notes. As for small, less credible banks, the financial authorities should also restrict the amount of promissory notes they issue to avoid undermining the credibility of promissory notes due to bounced checks, which would cause the public to distrust promissory notes.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Line Sailboat: Unprecedentedly Few Passengers</h3>
<p>Affected by fare increases, the number of passengers on both road transport vehicles has gradually decreased. At the same time, the number of passengers on the Shanghai-Ningbo line sailboats is similarly sparse. The Jiangjing sailboat of the China Merchants Bureau once sold only 300 passenger tickets, which is unprecedented. Now, during the recruitment period before and after the Qingming Festival, there is such a scene, and in the summer months of May and June, the number of passengers will be even scarcer.</p>
<h3>Dayu Steamer Sends Out Three SOS Signals: Lives on Board in Imminent Danger</h3>
<p>The Dayu steamer, belonging to the Dada Datong Joint Office in Shanghai, set sail from Shanghai to Hankou on March 27. On March 30, when sailing upstream past Wuhu, it was suddenly shot at. Yesterday, the Joint Office received the third SOS telegram from the steamer, stating that the coal and rice on board were about to run out, and the lives of everyone on board were in imminent danger, urgently requesting the authorities to send a warship to escort them to Guichi. Upon receiving the above telegram, the Joint Office immediately telegraphed Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Gui Yongqing in Nanjing, requesting him to send a warship for protection. Commander-in-Chief Gui immediately took measures to rescue them.</p>
<h3>Many Still Owe Shopping Certificates for Last Month's Rice Ration: Civilian Affairs Office is Thoroughly Investigating</h3>
<p>Since March, the Civilian Affairs Office has stipulated that citizens must submit Shopping Certificate No. 7 printed on their ID cards when receiving rice ration cards. This has been very effective in preventing fraudulent claims and re-issuance of rice ration cards. According to statistics from the Certificate Issuance Section of the Office, more than 600,000 unused rice ration cards were returned in March. The Office has dispatched staff to various district offices to check in detail whether the number of Shopping Certificate No. 7 turned in matches the number of rice ration cards actually issued. It is now known that 38 Shopping Certificate No. 7 are owed by the 7th Bao of Yangshupu District, 41 are owed by the 13th Bao, and 35 are owed by the 26th Bao. Penglai and Yimiao Districts have also not submitted all certificates. In particular, over 2,000 certificates are missing in the North Sichuan District, and the Office is reporting this to the authorities for thorough investigation. If any fraudulent activities are found, the Bureau of Civil Affairs will be involved in the investigation according to the law. This month, Shopping Certificate No. 19 is required for rice ration card exchange, and this will be strictly enforced. Citizens are urged to pay close attention.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Representatives of professors and students from national universities and colleges who went to Beijing to petition have returned to Shanghai yesterday. The professor representatives visited Acting President Li, Minister Hang, and others in Beijing. The government did not make any specific response to their request for salary calculation based on the price index. The government stipulated that the salaries for March in the Beijing-Shanghai area will be issued at 2,700 times the civil service index, which can be supplemented within one or two days. One week later, salaries for April will be issued at 2,700 times first, and will then be supplemented after the civil service index for April is announced.

<h3>China Textile Company Sued for Delay in Delivery: Court Rules Against the Plaintiff</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On September 6 of last year, Wufuxingji Dyeing and Weaving Factory was allocated one piece of 40-count Baoguang yarn from China Textile Company, paying a yarn price of 880 gold yuan, and one piece of 42-count Lanfeng yarn, paying 1,050 gold yuan. On September 21, it received warehouse receipts No. 25911 of Sha Zi from China Textile Factory No. 8 and No. 36172 of Sha Zi from China Textile Factory No. 19. It attempted to pick up the goods from each factory, but was refused due to being overdue. Wufu Factory sent a letter of negotiation on September 27, requesting an extension of the pickup date or a refund of the payment. It subsequently received a reply instructing it to first obtain proof from the receiving bank and then submit it for verification. After Wufu Factory obtained the proof and sent it, the China Textile authorities took away the original two warehouse receipts and only replied after more than a month: The date of issuance of the bill of lading was September 9. Why did your factory wait until September 21 to pick it up from the receiving bank? Although proven, it was overdue. According to regulations, it should be purchased back. Wufu Factory believed that it had suffered significant losses due to the delay of China Textile Company and requested the District Court to order delivery of the goods. However, the defendant, China Textile Company, argued that Wufu Factory paid to the Bank of China on September 7, but delayed until September 21 to pick up the bill of lading from the National Bank, while the National Bank received the delivery order submitted by the company as early as September 9, preparing for the plaintiff to pick it up. Therefore, the delay was not caused by the bank but by the plaintiff itself, which is obvious. After the District Court's judgment: The plaintiff's claim and request for provisional execution are both rejected.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers in the Hartung Road Resistance to Arrest Case Confess: Mastermind and Victim Related - Uncle Abducts Nephew - Gang Up to Rob - "Little Savage" on the Run and Wanted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At No. 35, Lane 240, Tung Jen Road (i.e., Hartung Road), the residence of Shui Ming-te, owner of the Shui Mei Da Shirt Shop, seven robbers broke in at 8:30 PM on the 24th of last month, wielding fast-firing machine guns and other weapons. During the robbery, they engaged in a struggle with police officers from the Jing'an Temple Branch. Three suspects, Dai You-san, Li Wu, and Chen Heng-biao, were apprehended, as detailed in this newspaper. It has now been learned that, after being taken into custody, Li confessed that the inside information for the robbery of the Shui residence was provided by Fan Zu-gen (nickname "Little Savage"), the younger brother of Shui Fan Yue-ying, the mistress of the Shui residence, who initiated the plan. The firearms were supplied by another accomplice, Liu Xiao Guozi. On the evening in question, at around 7:00 PM, they first gathered in a small teahouse near Wuzhen Road Bridge in Zhabei, then hired a Xiang Sheng car to drive to the robbery. At the time, Fan Zu-gen was wearing dark glasses and had a handkerchief covering his mouth. After the robbery, he was the first to rush out. Shortly after the police arrived, Fan Zu-gen was the first to open fire with a fast/slow-firing gun to resist arrest, firing a total of five or six shots. He also confessed the details of Fan Zu-gen's involvement in a prior incident of kidnapping his nephew. He stated that on February 27th, at around 4:00 PM, Shui Wen-bin, the son of Shui Ming-de, was reading a book at a small bookstall near the entrance of the lane. Fan Zu-gen arrived with his friend, known as A Wang, and, on the pretext of going to see a train, took the child to the North Railway Station.</p>
<p>He was taken to Suzhou and hidden. After Shui's wife, Fan Yue-ying, lost her son, she asked Zu-gen to find him. At the time, he readily agreed, falsely claiming to have many friends outside and that he would definitely have a way. On March 1st, Fan went to his sister's residence, falsely claiming to have some clues and that he needed a large gold bar to redeem his nephew. His sister was unable to provide this, and Fan left in disappointment. The next day, Yue-ying scraped together four gold rings and 130,000 yuan in cash and sent them to her mother's house at No. 29, Cheng Lai Lane, Emei Road, to be handed over to Zu-gen to redeem the ransom. Unexpectedly, when Zu-gen took the money and went out, he told his mother that Wen-bin was in Suzhou and</p>
<p>gave her a note to pass on to his sister. It read: "Your nephew is currently in a shanty in shed No. 49, Baocheng Bridge, Suzhou." Several days later, Yue-ying, not seeing her son return, hurried to her mother's house to inquire. Her mother explained that the gold rings and other items had been taken by Zu-gen and that his whereabouts were now unknown, but that he had left a note before leaving. After reading the note, the woman realized that her beloved son was in Suzhou. On the same day, the mother and daughter took a car to Suzhou and met A Wang, who was known to have taken the hostage. After questioning him, he said that the child had been handed over to him by Zu-gen to be taken to Suzhou. Thereupon, the mother and daughter went to the address, and they found Wen-bin and brought him back. Based on the above confession, Squad Leader Yu Ding ordered Patrol Officer Meng Rui-sheng to lead police officers Zheng Ji-wen, Xia Yong-chao, Lu Chang-jiang, and Yang Zhen-zhong to summon the mother, Fan Liu-shi, to the bureau for questioning, which confirmed the facts. The robbers, Dai You-san, and others, further confessed to having committed</p>
<p>two other robberies: (1) At 9:00 PM on February 8th, at the He Xing Tea Garden on Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, they robbed nine gold rings, two pairs of earrings, and a woolen blanket. (2) At 7:00 PM on March 11th, at the home of Zhang Xu-shi at No. 169 Hengtong Road, Zhabei, they robbed three gold rings. The branch bureau has now completed the investigation and will submit the case to the Garrison Headquarters for further action this morning. A wanted notice has been issued to arrest the fugitive mastermind, Fan Zu-gen, for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Seducing a Neighbor's Young Wife and Then Falsely Accusing Her Husband of Extortion</h3>
<p>Leather merchants Wu Yu-jin and Qin Xiu-da agreed to go to the Chang Ning Theatre on Chang Ning Road on the night of December 28th last year. They met Xian Jin-mei, the wife of their neighbor Zhuang Fu-gen. Wu and others, seeing that Xian was young and beautiful, went up to her to strike up a conversation. As a result, Qin lured her to the Yi Ding Hotel, where they had illicit relations for one night. Afterwards, Qin, fearing that her husband would discover the matter, had a far-fetched idea. He preemptively falsely accused Xian's husband, Zhuang Fu-gen, of extorting eighty dan of white rice from him. Wu Yu-jin also gave false testimony in the case. However, the police station eventually learned the truth and transferred Qin to the District Procuratorate for questioning. The prosecutor filed public charges against Qin for obstruction of freedom and false accusation. The case was initially heard in the District Court, and the court ordered a change of date to allow time for the case to be further investigated.</p>

<h3>National Products Factories Association - Telegram Requesting Suppression of High-Interest Loans - Advisable to Implement Low-Interest Industrial Loans as Proactive Measure</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factories Association recently sent a telegram to relevant ministries and commissions requesting the speedy suppression of usurious loans to maintain their survival. The original telegram is as follows: (Omitted above) We believe that the foundation of a nation lies in its economy, and the lifeblood of the economy lies in production. The prosperity or decline of production depends on the development of national industry as its main factor. At present, China's economy is exhausted, and there is suffering both above and below, and the situation is critical, and it is difficult to reorganize. Looking at the reasons, there is more than one, but the one that restricts the life of national goods factories the most is the unprecedentedly high interest rate, which is a serious threat, and it is difficult to get back to breathing. Now that our government is making every effort to reform and preside over major plans, and has pointed out that saving the economic crisis is the guiding principle of its policies, the whole country is looking forward to it. The association is located in Shanghai, the first economic zone in the country, and is the group of national goods factories. Having witnessed the pressing crisis of various member factories, it has to appeal to the upper levels and seek salvation. In recent years, the difficulties of industry mentioned are nothing more than the lack of raw materials, the increasing daily expenses, the excessive cost, and the heavy taxes. All of these are the general state, but none of them are as high as the usurious</p>
<p>Deep and serious pain. Factories producing national goods rely on the financial industry for turnover. Looking at the advanced countries with developed industries, loan interest rates are generally low. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the legal annual interest rate was only 2%, and the deadline was even longer. Each factory could barely maintain itself because the interest rate was low and the prices were high. In comparison, even if sales were ordinary, there was still a surplus to be made. However, the recent facts are very different. The average market interest rate is 60% to 70% per diem. Borrowers have to bear the corresponding interest after eight or nine days. Using this interest rate speed to calculate costs, prices can rise to seven or eight times in a month. If the funds are tight, the daily demolition rate can even be as high as 100 or 150 yuan, then the cost burden is even more difficult to count. In addition, the expenses are huge, production is reduced, purchasing power is weak,</p>
<p>Sales channels are narrowing. If we want to maintain the material and finished products, we cannot bear the burden of high-interest loans. If we sell them at a discount, the income we receive will not be enough to compensate for the original capital for reproduction. Under such multiple exploitations and without any restrictions, I am afraid that in less than two months, seven out of ten factories in Shanghai will declare business suspension and bankruptcy, the number of unemployed workers will suddenly increase, there will be a lack of means to earn a living, and the national economy will collapse. In the near future, looking to the future, we will shiver. Now, in order to prevent problems before they occur, we plan to ask the authorities to provide relief as soon as possible. The passive strategy should be to issue a clear order to strictly limit and suppress high-interest loans, and the active strategy should be low-interest industrial loans, and to simplify loan procedures, so as to maintain the survival of the national industry. If so, it can stabilize the economic situation in the city, and be in line with the purpose of saving the national economic crisis. An urgent enquiry, I beg you to adopt and implement it, and I cannot express my joy. Chairman of the Shanghai National Products Factories Association, Hu Boxiang, respectfully kowtows. Mao Dongyin.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang's Treasure - Fluorite Mine</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Huang Xingtian</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st] More than 20 years ago, a Mr. He Zhihan in Wuyi first discovered that the local emerald ore had important value in modern industry, so he started mining it and made a considerable profit. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, a Mr. Li Wanpeng in Xiangshan also mined this ore at the southern foot of Wusi Mountain and transported it to Japan for sale. This emerald ore is fluorite, a flux used in iron smelting (originally named Fluorite, or Fluorspar, i.e., calcium fluoride CaF2). This often transparent, colorful cubic crystal with a glass-like luster, in addition to accounting for about 82 percent of the total production as an iron smelting flux, the rest is used to manufacture hydrofluoric acid and colored glass, and can also be used to manufacture enamel. Pure and transparent, it can also be carved into various utensils and ornaments. In terms of</p>
<p>In terms of the quality of fluorite, Zhejiang surpasses South Korea and holds the authoritative position in Asia. Although the fluorite quality is also good in other domestic areas such as Linxiang in Hunan, Jiaoxian in Shandong, Jiaocheng in Shanxi, and Longhua in Rehe, the output is far less abundant than in Zhejiang. In Zhejiang, according to surveys, there are more than 50 counties, including Jinhua, Yiwu, Xinchang, Shengxian, Xiangshan, and Wuyi. Among them, Wuyi has the most reserves, and Xiangshan has the most convenient transportation. The mining of fluorite in Zhejiang was very prosperous before the September 18th Incident. There were as many as 18 counties where merchants and people obtained mining rights. The annual output was mostly over 10,000 tons. Because the main sales target of fluorite was Japan, the output gradually decreased after the September 18th Incident until the active phenomenon was restored in the 23rd year. After the Anti-Japanese War, Wuyi and Jinhua fell one after another. The enemy puppet China Mining Company mined it in a big way and built narrow-gauge railways to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway or the seaport for transportation. Hundreds of thousands of tons of fluorite were stolen and mined. After the victory, all the enemy-left mines, houses, calcium carbide, and remaining fluorite were taken over by the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. However, for the past three years, they have never been repaired or utilized, and the houses and machines have been completely damaged. The remaining ore has also gradually weathered, and it has been stolen and sold from time to time. Even the roadbeds and bridges belonging to transportation have been dug up by residents. The modern mines and transportation that the enemy puppets opened up with the blood and sweat of the local people during the occupation period with cruel exploitation methods can not only not be used by the government as the production basis for economic recovery, but even the price of the blood and sweat of those people—the mined ore—is ignored and allowed to weather. The Enemy Property Administration Bureau neither handles nor manages this precious heavy industrial raw material, and allows it to be stolen, transported, destroyed, and allowed to be transported, destroyed, and this kind of intention really makes the people feel cold.</p>
<p>After Chen Yi took charge of Zhejiang, he began to pay attention to this natural treasure and the existing artificial foundation. In order to revive the economy of Zhejiang, he was determined to</p>
<p>To develop fluorite mines and sell fluorite abroad to earn foreign exchange, buy rails back to the country, and build a network of narrow-gauge railways in important economic areas of the province as a blood vessel for building new Zhejiang. This plan is to start with the two major mining areas of Wuyi, which has the most output, and Xiangshan, which has the most convenient transportation. The Wuyi mining area is located about 45 kilometers southeast of Jinhua. The large mining area is located in the basin near the suburbs of Wuyi County, covering an area of about 123 square kilometers; the small mining area is located in Jiangwandong, 15 kilometers away from the city, covering an area of about 25 square kilometers. The total reserves in the county are about 2,000,000 tons. When the enemy puppet China Mining Company managed it, narrow-gauge railways were built; the products in the urban area were first transported to Huangjiaotan, Wuyi Port, on the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, eight miles away from the city, and then transported by rafts to Jinhua and then transferred to Hangzhou. The enemy puppets built two power plants and 80 houses in the mining area. Now, even the narrow-gauge railway has been completely destroyed. Within the territory of Wuyi, merchants have already obtained mining rights for Wuweilong 2.73 hectares; Changshe Mountain, Renxing Mountain 14.46 hectares, Jiangwandong 20.08 hectares, Shilonggang 8.60 hectares, totaling 45.87 hectares and 20 mm. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Government Construction Department surveyed five large mining areas and one small mining area, with a total area of 63 acres and 20 mm, and has applied to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval to set up mining rights.</p>
<p>The Xiangshan mining area is located in Xikou Township, Maoyang Village, and Wusi Mountain, 25.5 kilometers away from the city, about 50 miles away from Shipu Town. The reserves were originally estimated at only 250,000 tons. It is reported that the enemy China Mining Company has stolen 200,000 tons, and the remaining reserves are no less than 250,000 tons. The fluorite left by the enemy is also about 30,000 tons. The total area of the mining rights obtained by merchants is 1.25 hectares and 9 mm. The enemy once built a narrow-gauge railway of 7.8 mm and a highway of about 3 to 4 kilometers from the mining area to Xiehan Ferry. Now the roadbed is intact, but the bridges and culverts have been destroyed. Now the provincial government plans to restore the existing narrow-gauge railway, so the fluorite in the Maoyang Village mining area can be transported to Xieqian Ferry by narrow-gauge railway, loaded onto small steamships, cross Yuejingyang to Shipu Town, and then transferred to large steamships and transported to Shanghai for export. In Mr. Chen Gongqia's plan, he also wants to extend the railway from Xieqian Ferry to Shipu and develop Xiangshan as a seaport, so it can be directly exported, and transportation will be more convenient at that time. The Zhejiang Provincial Government made a first</p>
<p>The first transaction made by Zhejiang Provincial Government through Shao Hongshu, the economic representative stationed in Japan, with the Japanese government was to exchange 1,700 tons of fluorite (US$40 per ton) for steel rails of equal value. The fluorite required will also be transported from the Xiangshan mining area.</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the new Provincial Chairman Zhou Yan and Construction Director Liu Jimin are both soldiers, but they are also very enthusiastic about developing fluorite mines and have retained Director Li of the competent department to continue to actively carry out the work. Therefore, political and personnel changes have not affected the exploitation of this treasure, but the political system has always hindered the active exploitation of this plan. Because the two fluorite mines in Wuyi and Xiangshan and the fluorite left behind were taken over by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau as enemy property. However, for the past three years since the restoration, the Enemy Property Administration Bureau has neither handled nor managed them, and has tolerated the fluorite being stolen and weathered, and the houses and roadbeds being destroyed. They believe that there is no profit to be made, so they have abandoned them and have not even sent a single person to guard them. They only sold more than 1,000 tons of existing fluorite to merchants; and that merchant sold more than the quota without any hindrance and made a lot of money. However, when the Zhejiang Provincial Government was determined to exploit fluorite, it sent several official letters requesting its transfer, but they were all lost in the sea. The former Director of the Construction Department, Gong Peicheng, personally rushed to Shanghai to negotiate, and only received a reply saying that it had been transferred to the Resource Committee for management. Even so, relevant personnel of the provincial government still received private letters saying that if the Zhejiang Provincial Government wanted the property rights, they could still purchase them at a price; the public servant who was enthusiastic about construction looked at it and did not know whether to laugh or cry. Under such a situation of three parties fighting for power, the Zhejiang Provincial Council righteously supported the provincial government and passed a motion at the recent general meeting: "It has been found that the fluorite mined by the enemy puppets in Wuyi, Yiwu, Xiangshan and other counties during the war has not been shipped out. According to the Construction Department, there are more than 50,000 tons. Exchanging it for steel rails used for narrow-gauge railways can pave hundreds of kilometers of narrow-gauge railways. Therefore, it is recommended that the provincial government should continue to sell or exchange rails for these items according to the previous resolution, and complete the narrow-gauge railway plan to achieve the purpose of utilizing resources. It has also been heard that this fluorite has been sold to the Resource Committee by the Enemy Property Administration Bureau at a low price and belongs to it. We should strive for it according to reason. When the enemy puppets stole the mining, the people in the counties near the mining area suffered great damage to manpower and materials, so the price they obtained must be allocated to local construction in the province in order to be fair and impartial." The Zhejiang Provincial Government's exploitation of fluorite is not to make up for the provincial finances, but to focus on the local economic construction of Zhejiang, and the enemy's fluorite should be used as the price for their blood and sweat, and to seek welfare for them. Moreover, whether it is the central government or the local government, they should respect public opinion and serve the people. There is no reason to fight for power and profits and hinder the promotion of economic construction. Zhejiang Fluorite.</p>
<p>The prospect is promising. According to experts, the fluorite quality in Wuyi is above 90%, and the composition in Xiangshan is also above 80%. The former American Jiangnan Company sent a German engineer to conduct on-site testing, and the results were the same. Therefore, Zhejiang fluorite is not only far better than that produced in South Korea, but can also compete with Canada in the international market. Now, the fluorite that Japan urgently needs is supplied by South Korea. Although the United States has abundant domestic production, it still needs to be supplied from Canada. It is estimated that Zhejiang's fluorite production and sales can sell at least 50,000 tons to Japan and the United States each year, so there can be a profit of US$1 million to US$1.5 million per year. Using this valuable foreign exchange to build Zhejiang, the future of new Zhejiang will be easier to realize. We look forward to the smooth exploitation of fluorite mines and the rapid arrival of a prosperous new Zhejiang!</p>

<h3>The Northeastern Edge of Zhejiang (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Exploring Factors of Tranquility</p>
<p>The reporter has investigated the factors contributing to this peace. First, of course, it is the local affluence, being a true land of fish and rice, where the people can all be well-fed and clothed. Therefore, the people are peaceful and the customs are kind, and they will not take risks unless they are on the verge of desperation. The land issue is not serious because landlords grant perpetual tenancy rights to tenant farmers. Tax reduction of 25% and rent reduction are both reducing the rights of landlords. Therefore, the landlord class is gradually declining. Second, because Commissioner Yu Shuluan has been in charge of this area for ten years, due to Yu's own integrity and his hard work, the general public has respect and awe for Yu. Therefore, local people are quite harmonious, without factional divisions, and no one wants to establish their own independent banner, recruit soldiers, and buy horses to seek the development of their own power. Third, because there are no factions in the area, everyone cooperates and plans for the local area. The self-defense organization is still relatively strict, and the self-defense force is also quite strong. For example, Changxing County has more than 2,000 rifles and more than 70 machine guns. The people have accurate marksmanship and can shoot flying sparrows with rifles.</p>
<p>Protecting the Territory and Pacifying the People First</p>
<p>Commissioner Yu Shuluan once said to the reporter, "We local officials only know how to protect the territory and pacify the people. If anyone wants to harm the people or bully the people, then we must eliminate the violence for the people. In recent months, the Communist army has not come to disrupt the territory, but there are many disturbances from wandering troops, scattered soldiers, and stragglers posing as wounded. Recently, many unidentified teams from Jiangsu have flowed into the territory, with a somewhat distorted development of reverting to guerrilla warfare as in wartime. Their discipline is extremely poor, and the people complain bitterly about them. Therefore, the territory is gradually feeling uneasy. For example, in the current year, in just March, it has been reported that there have been eight robbery cases in Wuxing, five in Jiaxing, six in Jiashan, two each in Changxing and Pinghu, and one each in Deqing and Haiyan, totaling twenty-two cases. Obviously, there is great unrest. If there is no way to improve the people's lives, then it may increase those who take risks. The future is truly worrying."</p>

<h3>Liu Wenhui and the Political Situation in Sichuan and Xikang</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Reporter Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chengdu of This Newspaper, dated the 30th] The recent brewing of turmoil in the political situation in Sichuan and Xikang has attracted attention at home and abroad. Liu Wenhui, the protagonist of the Sichuan and Xikang political situation who has roamed the southwest political arena for more than 20 years, has thus attracted more general attention. Xikang is a mysterious region in western China. Liu Wenhui has governed Kang for more than 20 years. To uncover the inside story of Xikang and explore the context of the political situation in Sichuan and Xikang, one must have a thorough understanding of Liu Wenhui.</p>
<p>Life History - Diplomatic Manoeuvring</p>
<p>Mentioning Liu Wenhui easily makes one think of Feng Yuxiang, the famous "turncoat" Christian general, whose life history is full of diplomatic manoeuvring. Among the senior generals of the Sichuan Army today, Liu's qualifications are relatively shallow, and he is only in his fifties. He rose to prominence thanks to the recommendation of his fellow villager Chen Hongfan from Dayi. During the revolutionary Northern Expedition, he was transferred from the Sichuan Post-War Relief Office to the commander of the 24th Army. He defeated his fellow villager Liu Chengxun, and his career was smooth, rising to the throne of Chairman of Sichuan Province and concurrently serving as the Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense. In 1933, the Second Liu Civil War broke out, and Liu Xiang led his troops west. In the Battle of Kunhe, Liu Wenhui's entire army was defeated and fled in a panic into Xikang. The army was sharply reduced from more than 100 regiments to more than 10 regiments. From then on, Liu temporarily bid farewell to the political stage of Sichuan. But then came two opportunities to reverse his misfortune. One was that the Communist army entered Sichuan in 1935, and the civil war in Sichuan stopped, giving Liu a chance to breathe. The second was that the War of Resistance broke out in 1937, and the National Government moved west to Chongqing. Xikang was preparing to establish a province due to its important strategic location. In 1938, the Central Government transferred the six counties of the Sichuan Ya area and the eight counties of the Ning area to Xikang. The following year, the provincial government was established, and Liu Wenhui began to formally control Xikang. During the War of Resistance, the Sichuan soldiers went to Sichuan to fight the war, but Liu Wenhui stayed in Xikang alone and did not take a single step out of the Kui Gate. Zhang Qun concurrently managed the chairmanship in order to settle the local area and tried his best to win over Liu. Therefore, from the War of Resistance to the victory, Liu always steadily served as the leader of Xikang, smoothly managing his strength in order to make a comeback.</p>
<p>Governing Kang by Kang People - Prelude to Success</p>
<p>The people of Kang have long had a definite evaluation of Liu Wenhui's merits and demerits in governing Kang, which need not be repeated here. But there is no doubt that since the establishment of Xikang Province, the people of Kang have generally been dissatisfied with Liu. Therefore, Xikang has been brewing a "Kang people governing Kang" movement for more than ten years, such as the famous "Nona Incident" and "Ganzi Incident," which are examples of this. The largest scale was the "Ya Area Incident" in 1946. The cause of the incident was that the "rioters" of Tianquan, Lushan, Baoxing, and Rongjing were dissatisfied with the provincial government's "public opium" policy and rose up to "resist eradication." In less than ten days, it spread throughout the entire territory, and the counties of Tianquan and Lushan were captured. At the same time, upper-level ambitious people used the opportunity to universally launch a "Down with Liu" movement. From Sichuan to Shanghai, a huge wave was set off, making Liu's control feel threatened and shaken. Therefore, Liu spared no expense to put down the rebellion, including large-scale monetary activities, threats and inducements, partial reorganization of the provincial government, and using official positions as bait. He finally exhausted all his efforts, and the rebellion gradually subsided. As a result of the reorganization of the provincial government, the little-known Tao Liangsheng became the Secretary-General, Chen Yaolun became the Director of the Land and Food Department, and Zhang Tanru became the Director of the Education Department. This was a prelude to the success of "Kang people governing Kang," showing that Liu Wenhui's power to control Xikang was beginning to decline!</p>
<p>Military and Political Cadres - Surrounding Him</p>
<p>The military and political cadres surrounding Liu Wenhui naturally play a considerable role in the current political situation in Sichuan and Xikang. Zhang Shaoyang, the acting chairman of the Xikang Provincial Government and concurrently the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, is from Dechang, Xikang. He was Liu's classmate at Baoding and has assisted Liu for decades. He is mediocre and ordinary. Li Wanhua, the Director of the Department of Finance, is Liu's economic "chief steward" and has considerable power in the financial circles of Sichuan and Xikang. Zhang Yuanru, the Director of the Education Department, was originally the Director of the Political Department of the 24th Army and rose to prominence through flattery. Zhang Jingxi, the Director of the Department of Construction and a former National Senator, enjoys a good reputation in Xikang. Wang Mengzhou, the Director of the Department of Social Affairs, is directly appointed by the Central Government. Wang Jingyu, the Director of the Department of Security, is one of the leaders of the veteran faction of the Kang Army. These people are all Liu's political cadres. In terms of military affairs, Liu's basic troops are the 24th Army, and Liu concurrently serves as the commander. It is entirely a force of his own followers, and the real power is entirely in the hands of the "young military men of Xikang." The division commanders include Liu's son-in-law Wu Peiying, Liu's nephews Liu Yuanxuan and Liu Yuancong. From generals to cadres, they are all members of the Liu family. This can be said to be the most feudal and outdated old-fashioned feudal warlord force in the "National Army." The main reason for the Ya Area Incident was that the relationship between the army and the people was too bad, and Liu's indulgence of his children and generals is also to blame. The general public opinion is that the military and political cadres surrounding Liu Wenhui are indeed not as good at military affairs as they are at writing.</p>
<p>The national situation has changed drastically, and war and peace are facing a crossroads. Xikang has become an important strategic town for western national defense. How to stabilize Xikang and build Xikang are the most difficult and most urgent issues that Liu Wenhui needs to solve. In light of the current situation in the country and in Sichuan and Xikang, and in light of Liu's current situation, the only way is to work hard to build Xikang and stabilize the rear. This is the key to his success or failure in the future, and everything is waiting for his wise decision.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Soar Uncontrollably: Top Grade White Rice and Thin Rice Reach 160,000</h3>
<p>The rice price surge is like a mania, spiraling out of control. The Social Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to the market to suppress it, and the head of the Grain Department is personally sitting in charge, but yesterday was Saturday, and due to the two-day interest, the merchants raised prices. Also, because the market is closed for three days during the spring holiday, rice shops replenished in advance, resulting in very brisk sales and soaring prices. Prices were tightest early in the day and softened towards the close. In the North Market, top grade white rice closed at 160,000, special grade rice at 165,000, and in the South Market, top grade white rice was 155,000 and thin rice was 160,000, each rising by about 40,000. The market quotes still show the previous day's original price, but note the cash price. However, cash transactions within the market are extremely rare. Arrivals at the two markets totaled 6,933 shi.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Prices soared sharply. Because rice prices had risen sharply previously, people were very nervous, and merchants tried their best to raise prices. The surge was fierce and unusual. Soybean oil closed at 770,000 and 760,000, up 160,000. Jitou's raw oil was 840,000, also up 160,000. Rapeseed oil was 660,000 and 650,000, all rising sharply by more than 25%. Soybean cake rose by 6,000 to 7,000, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Rose violently, because of the three-day Spring Festival holiday. At this time of unstable and uncertain conditions, people are largely optimistic. Because rice prices soared, merchants raised prices even more forcefully. At the opening, the prices of all brands of flour broke through five levels, rising sharply by about 25%. Later, rice prices eased slightly, and people became tired, and the price fell back by 1,000 yuan. Laoche closed at 53,000 yuan, and Bingchuan traded at 51,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>The rising trend is still strong, but because of tight money, buying interest is very weak, so transactions are not booming. Soybeans rose sharply by 20%. Hankou Chendou was priced as high as 120,000, and Pinghu Doudou reached 140,000. Raw peanuts broke the 300,000 mark. Sesame merchants raised prices, and the market was deadlocked. Only milk sesame opened at 240,000. Rice and red beans rose together by 20%, and mung beans did not open.</p>
<h3>Spot Transactions in the Rice Market Still Do Not Exceed 120,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Recently, prices have soared, and the rise in rice prices is particularly strong. Yesterday, the retail price per shi had already broken through the 160,000 yuan mark. This reporter visited Cao Peizi, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday and asked what measures the bureau has taken in response to the sharp rise in rice prices. According to Director Cao, he convened a meeting of the heads of the North and South rice markets on the 1st of this month, instructing them to pay attention to the people's food problem and not to seek exorbitant profits, and to bear the blame for leading the rise in prices. They assured the Social Affairs Bureau that spot transactions would not exceed 120,000 yuan per shi yesterday. When the rice market opened yesterday, futures trading took place, and next-day transactions had to bear three days of interest (Saturday, Sunday, and the Tomb Sweeping Festival on the 4th), and rice prices soared to 160,000 yuan. After hearing this news, he immediately ordered the North and South markets to stop futures trading and hoped that the market leaders would fulfill their promises. It is reported that spot transactions yesterday still did not exceed 120,000 yuan. As for check transactions, it is a commercial custom, and the rumor that he ordered a ban is inaccurate. The Social Affairs Bureau will convene a meeting on the 4th with the Public Opinion Survey Office and the Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee to jointly discuss measures to suppress rice prices.</p>
<p>According to Wang Jiashu, Director of the First Division of the Security Bureau, the reasons for the sharp rise in rice prices are: (1) cash panic, and rice payments cannot be remitted to the production areas; (2) the Tomb Sweeping Festival is approaching, and few villagers are transporting rice to Shanghai, resulting in an insufficient supply; (3) interest rates are too high; (4) eager buyers.</p>
<h3>Second Redemption of Gold Bonds: Lottery Held in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The second redemption lottery for the first series of short-term gold bonds of the Republic of China, Year 38, was held on the fourth floor of the China Trust Bureau. A total of five winning numbers were drawn: 03, 15, 47, 74, and 86. The Central Bank and its entrusted banks will handle the exchange procedures starting from April 4th.</p>
<h3>Banking and Financial Industry Imposes Rigid Regulations on Business and Exchange Hours</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The banking, financial, and trust industries association has now re-regulated banking hours and bill exchange hours and will probably implement them starting on the 9th.

Those who send bills and exchange them after the deadline will be settled on the second day. No accommodations can be made for missing documents.</p>
<h3>Forged Bank Notes Discovered</h3>
<p>The Financial Control Bureau is Investigating Thoroughly</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Financial Control Bureau is paying close attention to the recent proliferation of bank notes on the market and hopes that merchants and the public will refuse to accept bank notes issued by banks in violation of regulations (such as those with a fixed amount on the face or a rubber stamp for the responsible person's signature). In addition, the Financial Control Bureau is also investigating the rumored discovery of forged bank notes of the China National Products Bank on the market.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Firm, Silver Dollars Lucrative</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the trend of gold was firm. In the morning, because 5% of the gold bonds from the second series were redeemed, 50,000 taels of funds flowed out, and people were reassured. The opening price was 1,025,000. Midway, because the Central Bank did not sell, and retail sales were strong, with active sales from silver shops and gold shops, prices soared to 1,051,000. Towards the close, because there were more long positions, the price fell slightly to close at 1,047,000.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the market was closed due to the weekend. The interbank clearing price was 1,038,000, an increase of 83,000 from the previous day, equivalent to an interest rate of about 8.5%.</p>
<p>Off-Market</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the off-market was stable in the morning, opening at 1,020,000 and 1,030,000, rising to 1,043,000 and 1,048,000, and closing at 1,042,000 and 1,047,000 at noon. In the afternoon, because prices in other ports were reported to have risen, and with 10 billion Taiwan dollars released, the money market gradually became more relaxed, and secret interest rates fell to 60 to 70 yuan. People were optimistic, and same-day delivery rose to 1,100,000 and 1,150,000. The initial price for next-day delivery was 1,245,000 and 1,255,000. The final price in the evening rose to 1,270,000 and 1,280,000, also an increase of 4,000 from the previous day.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The price of ornamental gold in silver shops was stable, still quoted at 1,010,000 and 1,100,000 in the morning, and unchanged in the afternoon. However, ornamental silver rose to 11,000 and 13,000, up 1,000. The price of money changers rose in the morning from 1,030,000 and 1,070,000 to 1,050,000 and 1,100,000 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>US Dollars</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the off-market price of US dollars was strong because import and export companies and banks were actively seeking them. The opening price was 21,500 and 22,000, rising to 22,000 and 22,500, and falling to 21,000 and 21,500. The noon closing price was 21,800 and 22,500. Transactions were sparse in the afternoon. The asking price for next-day delivery rose to 25,000 and 26,000, an increase of 200.</p>
<p>Silver Dollars</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage became more active again. Because prices in other ports gradually approached those in this city, both parties felt it was worthwhile. About 800,000 to 900,000 were arbitrated from South China and West China. Street trading was initially flat and then firm. In the morning, the price of big heads was 17,500 and 18,500. In the afternoon, it was rumored that the Central Bank was absorbing large quantities, and people were optimistic. The price of big heads rose all the way from 18,000 and 19,000 to 19,000 and 20,000. The price of small heads was 15,500 and 16,500. The price of dragon and eagle coins was 12,000 and 13,000. Money changers and securities companies engaged in cross-market trading of big heads. The initial price for same-day check transactions was 19,000 and 20,000, rising to 22,000 and 24,000 in the afternoon, an increase of 2,000 from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn rose sharply across the board, mainly because of the two-day interest rate, which led to merchants raising prices sharply, but direct sales were still not very brisk. The opening price of 42 count blue phoenix yarn was 7,600,000 yuan. Under the hype from surface traders, the trend rose rapidly. The noon closing price was close to the 8,000,000 mark, at 7,900,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 980,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Intense Struggle between Bulls and Bears: The Chinese Stock Market Flourishes</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday was the weekend for Chinese stocks, and the struggle between bulls and bears was fierce. The market was stable in the first half, and a battle unfolded in the second half. Major players hyped the market, and retail investors panicked. The difference between the rise and fall of the market reached more than one yuan. Initially, due to tight overnight funds, the market interest rate rose to 1.2 yuan. The Yongsha discount rate also rose to 88 yuan and 93 yuan. With the double burden of interest, the market slowed down. The morning opened at a low price of 13 yuan. Short positions were covered, rising to 14 yuan. Then it was heard that the spot supply was exhausted, and yarn merchants continued to seek supplies, and securities merchants followed suit, once raising the price to 15.3 yuan. Later, it was heard that the Central Bank continued to sell gold, and people became flustered. The selling trend on the surface became evident, falling to 14.2 yuan, and finally rising again to the edge of 15 yuan. Around noon, the prices of goods outside the circle rose together, and merchants eagerly sought orders, with tight money. The market fell back again, finally closing at 14.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Among the small and medium-sized stocks, Meiya rose sharply after opening, and the noon closing price was stable. Jingfu rose to the limit. Xinguang was initially weak and then strong. The trends of Qinxing and Xinhe were healthy. Several other brands also rose to the limit, and miscellaneous brands were also lucrative.</p>
<p>In the later market, it was initially heard that the money market was slightly relaxed, and buying sentiment turned strong. All stocks rose together. Yongsha immediately reached the 16.8 yuan limit after opening. Afterwards, it fell slightly by 0.2 yuan, and then reached the limit again at the close.</p>
<p>The off-market trading price of Yongsha initially opened at 15.5 yuan, rose to 16.35 yuan in the middle, and then fell back to 15.75 yuan at the close. Others such as Xinguang, Meiya, and Jingfu all rose by about 20%. The total turnover of the entire market was 4.9263 billion shares.</p>
<p>The gold bond market was quiet, with few transactions. The opening price was 655,000 for selling and 640,000 for buying. The final price rose to 650,000 with transactions, an increase of 60,000 from the previous.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks Yesterday was the weekend, and the interest burden was too heavy. All parties were eager to get rid of them. The initial opening was still flat, but because Chinese stocks were reported to be rising, people were encouraged. The noon closing price rebounded together. Yisha traded at 35,000 yuan and 36,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 5,000 yuan. British United traded at 37,000 yuan and 38,000 yuan, an increase of 11,500 yuan. Jardine Matheson traded at 115,000 and 120,000, a further increase of 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>— Spectator</p>
<p>Rice Market Has Price Limits, Still Needs the Stick</p>
<p>Rice prices are shockingly high, even more shocking to think about!</p>
<p>Rice stocks are in the countryside, especially in Anhui and Jiangxi. The Yangtze River cannot be cut off, otherwise, the people of Shanghai will suffocate.</p>
<p>To stabilize the people's food supply, the Social Bureau has stepped in to control prices and reinstate price limits. Hopefully, they will redouble their efforts to ensure long-term stability.</p>
<p>Some say: Yesterday in the rice market, prices stabilized at 130,000 yuan from the day before's high, giving face to the Social Bureau. In reality, rice can only be bought with cash. However, rice market transactions usually use promissory notes. Now, with the cash shortage, no one will use cash anymore. Therefore, this price limit of 130,000 yuan per picul exists only in name. As for buying with promissory notes, a premium must be added. Yesterday, using Monday's notes required adding two days' interest, so it would cost no less than 160,000 to 170,000 yuan. That's how prices supposedly aren't rising.</p>
<p>I believe that as long as the price limit of 130,000 yuan per picul can be maintained, then despite the premium or interest, it can still be controlled to some extent. The problem is the fear that the limits won't hold. And even if they do hold, there's the fear of not being able to buy rice. The people of Shanghai are all exceptionally rich in this kind of experience.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, there were rumors of dozens of firms faltering. Yesterday's report said it was an April Fool's joke, which is a bit harmful. But yesterday, news came that the faltering firms are still faltering, just blamed on April Fool's Day.</p>
<p>I heard that several firms were supported by a certain major firm yesterday, so they luckily overcame the crisis. But there are still a few that haven't been settled.</p>
<p>At a time when promissory notes are flying around, firms cannot afford to falter. If even a slight disturbance causes a few to collapse, it could immediately affect the entire situation.</p>
<p>Because every firm issues promissory notes, which are not cashed anyway, it's impossible to verify their actual value. In particular, the circulation of promissory notes in the market, overnight in people's pockets, is fine when the market is stable. But when the market is volatile, it's extremely dangerous. One wrong move, and it will all fall on people's heads.</p>
<p>Issuing too many promissory notes is like firms writing bad checks. Customers don't deposit them in the bank, so the bad checks aren't exposed. If the promissory notes are deposited, the bank sends them to the clearinghouse, and the truth becomes clear.</p>
<p>Recently, many people who receive promissory notes don't deposit them. Many firms are already unstable, and if everyone deposits their promissory notes, then firms that issue too many will become even more unstable.</p>
<p>In the past two or three weeks, remittances from Taiwan have had a significant impact on the city's finances.</p>
<p>The Central Bank exhausts its efforts to withdraw funds, but as soon as remittances arrive from Taiwan, the Central Bank's efforts are completely undone.</p>
<p>This is the general perception, but it misunderstands the subtle intricacies.</p>
<p>The Central Bank throws out goods, which people say is withdrawing funds.</p>
<p>But when the Central Bank buys goods, it's actually releasing funds.</p>
<p>The so-called "overtly selling, covertly buying" shows that the buying must be covert. So, the talk of remittances from Taiwan is not unrelated to this covert buying.</p>
<p>Keeping Promissory Notes Overnight Is a Big Risk</p>

<h3>Shanghai Police Avenge Defeat, Ren Yu Suffers Unexpected Loss, Jian Le in C Group Has High Hopes of Winning Title</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Last night in the basketball league, the Shanghai Police Ren Yu Er Branch Youth Army had their second encounter. This was also Ren Yu's last match in Group A. Ren Yu, already secured as runner-up, was confident of winning against the Shanghai Police again last night. Unexpectedly, General Sun Guozheng was absent, morale was low, and the team lacked fighting spirit, leading to a complete collapse. The second half was even more uncontrollable. As a result, the Shanghai Police achieved a great victory, avenging their humiliation in the first round. The score was 55-36, a significant difference of 19 points. At halftime, it was 26-16, with Ren Yu already trailing by a considerable margin. The Shanghai Police had excellent shooting luck last night, with almost every shot hitting the mark. In the latter half of the second half, Ren Yu had completely disintegrated, and the Shanghai Police's empty back defense was easily penetrated, causing the situation to deteriorate rapidly. The Shanghai Police played with increasing energy, with Liang Yongbiao being particularly active. Fortunately for Ren Yu, Shen Pengju scored 21 points alone, holding up the situation somewhat. The closest score in the first half was 15-12, with Ren Yu trailing by three points. After that, the gap gradually widened, fluctuating between 12, 13, 15, and 16 points. Before the match, the women's team Li easily defeated the Li team, 35-14. In Group C of Group B, Jian Le defeated the American Meteorological Team, 53-31.</p>
<p>Ren Yu's players were Wu Xinyun, Xu Zhongji, Shen Pengju, Li Zhaohe, and Wang Huaiting. The Shanghai Police's players were Wang Bowen, He Zeng, Shi Jiuquan, Wang Rongsheng, and Fu Qixia.</p>
<p>After the two sides made contact, Shi Jiuquan of the Shanghai Police scored first after three minutes. He Zeng then scored another point. Shen Pengju of Ren Yu scored a free throw, making it 1-4. Yao Wenyi replaced Zhaohe, and the score returned to 7-3. Wang Bowen of the Shanghai Police scored a corner shot, and Jiuquan continued to score. Shen Pengju of Ren Yu made consecutive free throws, and the score gradually narrowed, 15-12, with Ren Yu trailing by only three points. Unexpectedly, Bowen and He Zeng of the Shanghai Police made free throws, and Qixia also scored under the basket. At halftime, the Shanghai Police still led 26-16.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Shanghai Police replaced Bowen with Liang Yongbiao. Liang scored repeatedly upon entering the court, showing considerable power. Pengju and Zhongji of Ren Yu struggled to fight back. Ren Yu's Zhuang Yirong replaced Huaiting, making it 33-20. Bowen of the Shanghai Police replaced Jiuquan, but Wang soon committed five fouls and was replaced by Shi again. Ren Yu also replaced Zhaohe with Huaiting. After this, Ren Yu's back defense was often empty, the outcome was decided, and they were continuously trampled upon by the Shanghai Police, ultimately losing 36-55.</p>

<p>Li Team Easily Defeats Li Team</p>
<p>The women's team took the stage first. After the start of the game, the free throws by Fan Yuying and Liang Miaoling of the Li team seemed a bit weak, and none of them scored. In five minutes, the two teams scored sporadically from free throws. Qian Youping of the Li team scored three points, changing the situation to 9-3. In the first quarter, it was 11-4. The two Qian sisters received assistance from Yao Silian, succeeding on both sides. In the second quarter, the Li team's forwards were quite "cold," and at halftime, the Li team had 20 points, while the Li team had 4 points. In the third quarter, Zhu Cuidi replaced Youping, Chen Wenyan served as a forward instead of Chuping, and Xu Huiru replaced Wenyan. Soon, Qian Lili replaced Chen Yuqin. The Li team's three back defenders stood together, giving the opposing side a chance to attack, resulting in a score of 29-11. In the final quarter, the Li team still used its most elite lineup, making it even more difficult for the Li team. As a result, the Li team easily defeated the Li team 35-14.</p>

<h3>Main Battle of the Second Round, Qing Bai Faces Dragon Head Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The main battle in the second round of the football league, Qing Bai versus Dragon Head, has already been postponed once due to rain. It is scheduled to meet at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM today. However, due to the heavy rain all day yesterday, it is still uncertain whether this exciting game can be held as scheduled. Fans can call the football committee at 38683 before noon to inquire. If it can be held, the assigned referee will be He Chunhui, with line judges Chen Jixiang and Zhang Le. Ticket prices have been adjusted to 2,000 and 3,500 yuan. They will be sold at the city stadium starting at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Qing Bai recently had veteran players retire, and almost all of its players, except for Meng Yiliang, are new. However, their fighting strength has not been weakened as a result. They still maintain an undefeated record in Group A and are confident of winning the championship. However, after being eliminated in the Mayor's Cup due to underestimating their opponents, they will no longer be careless in the league. With a strong opponent ahead today, they will definitely show their full strength.</p>
<p>Dragon Head is the old partner of the Northeast Wind, with a Northern style, full of energy, bold and straightforward, and highly supported by fans. Unfortunately, the team has not been successful in the league and was eliminated in the first week of the Mayor's Cup. Facing Qing Bai again today is an opportunity to work hard and strengthen themselves.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Police Take Advantage of Victory, Face Hua Lian Again Tonight</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Tonight in the basketball league, the Shanghai Police, taking advantage of their victory over Ren Yu, will have their final battle in Group A of the league against the league champion Hua Lian. If they can defeat Hua Lian, they will have the same record as Ren Yu and share the runner-up position. Otherwise, they will be in third place. Hua Lian's victory or defeat has nothing to do with the championship, but in order to maintain their reputation, they will definitely not let up easily. They only won by nine points in the first round against the Shanghai Police. What will happen tonight remains to be seen after a fierce battle. In the women's group, the Green team will face Xing Hua for the first time, which should be exciting. The Green team did not lose in the first week; they forfeited the match. Tonight, there will be an additional friendly match: Huili will play a farewell match against the American Seamen, with the Seamen's strength not being strong and represented by the Qier teaching ship. Tickets are available in three types: 1,500, 3,000, and 5,500 yuan. The schedule is as follows: (1) Green Team - Xing Hua (Women's Group) 5:30 PM, (2) Huili - Seamen (Friendly Match) 6:15 PM, (3) Hua Lian - Shanghai Police (Group A) 7:15 PM.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Football Game Postponed Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Also, the football league Group A match between Zhong Hang and Zhi Chao, and the Youth Cup semi-final between the Pan team and the Firefly team, originally scheduled to be held at Yiyuan starting at 1:15 PM yesterday, were all postponed due to the relentless spring rain.</p>

<h3>Former Chinese Sports Referees Issue Honorary Certificates to Members</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The former Chinese Sports Referees Association, which served the sports community for more than ten years, with more than one hundred members all over the country, made great contributions to sports in our country. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was suspended due to the dispersal of its members. Now, in memory of the association, honorary certificates of membership service have been printed and are prepared to be distributed. It is hoped that the members of this and other provinces will inform Mr. Le Xiurong at No. 25 Xinhui Road, Jin Yuan Middle School, of the number of years they have served from the time of their admission until December 8, 1941, and specify what kind of sports.</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball Circle</h3>
<p>— Mei Jie</p>
<p>Talking About the Sporting Spirit of the Li Team</p>
<p>The author always believes that the spirit of the Li team is valuable because the team has been established for three years now, and each session they participate in ends up being the bottom team. However, they do not show any resentment on the field, consistently fighting earnestly. Even when the score difference is too large, they still maintain that spirit. This should be the advantage of athletes. However, on the other hand, we are also disappointed with the team, which is that the degree of progress is too slow. The reason for this is nothing more than that they are young, have poor physical fitness, and practice less. These problems, as we see them today, are already changing, which is that their age is ultimately three years older than when they were established, and their physical fitness is also visibly strengthened. At the same time, experience is undoubtedly increased through more games, and they have also gained leading figures this year. It is said that there are two enthusiastic people, Mr. Chen and Mr. Li, who encourage them and invited Mr. Wen Mayouyu to be the manager and Wang Huaiting, a Ren Yu player, to be the manager. With the strengthening of these factors, their performance this year is indeed better than in the previous two sessions. Recently, it was also stipulated that they will practice at the stadium every Wednesday and Friday. Of course, if they can maintain their current spirit and continue to work hard, then this day next year, they will definitely impress everyone.</p>
<p>Regarding guidance, I think it is worth studying. Most of the current teams in Shanghai want to learn the highest-level techniques, such as using fake moves and blocking methods! Of course, to make a team exciting, these techniques are necessary, but you have to pay attention. You can't ask a child who can't run to jump. How is that possible? In other words, if the players' basic movements are not yet mastered, how can they learn further movements and even apply methods? Therefore, the method of guiding the little heroes of the Li team should focus on basic movements and neglect methods. I wonder what Huaiting thinks?</p>
<p>The unity of the young players is also worth mentioning. They have been these same players since the team was founded, except for Chen Wenyan, who went to the Li team this year. Chen Wenyan is, of course, the mainstay of the team's defense, but she was recruited by another team, which is a pity. This is a case of a weak team having a special talent who is scouted away, making it difficult for the weak team to progress and stand out. Apart from Miss Chen, there are still several old partners. I hope they will cooperate until the end and not be captured by other teams after achieving some success. If they cooperate, they will eventually be able to use their strengths to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>As for the team members, I am very familiar with them. They are entirely a student army from middle school. Yao Wenda, Fan Yuying, and Weng Zhengyun are top students at Xizhen Girls' High School. The Liang Miaoling and Miaozhen sisters are studying at Xin Jian Middle School. In terms of skills, Liang Miaoling is the most adorable forward, short and energetic, and not bad at shooting. As for the defense, Yao Wenda (sister of Yao Wenyi, a Ren Yu player) is the most agile. The Wang Jiahua and Wang Jiacui sisters, the former a defender and the latter a forward, are also quite good. The others are also very hardworking players.</p>
<p>Finally, the author feels that the Li team has one of the best gains, which is that although they lose every battle, they always have countless spectators who are the volunteer cheerleaders for the weak. This is not an easy gain as a bit of mental comfort during the battle because it cannot be obtained solely by being inferior in skills. You must have a good sporting spirit and consistently show it to win the inner sympathy of the audience. I hope the Li team will work hard with the support of the masses! I wish the Li team a bright future!</p>

<h3>Side Notes</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>In the small city where I live, seven or eight out of ten families have women making lace.</p>
<p>Some say: "Women have progressed; they no longer play mahjong all day and can actually earn a little bit of money."</p>
<p>Some say: "The income of women from poor families is enough to feed one person for a day."</p>
<p>People with a broader perspective are saying: "Lace merchants are exploiting the surplus labor of housewives."</p>
<p>Lace merchants say: "Distributing lace is to help poor women and can also earn a lot of foreign exchange."</p>
<p>As I have heard, "That is also a right and wrong, this is also a right and wrong." I prefer a humble argument. The eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of the Civil War have been difficult enough for everyone. Men suffer, and women suffer even more—except for a small number of women, of course. Who doesn't want to enjoy a little leisure? Who is happy to spend all day holding a small thread, making decorative lace for foreigners? Hunger drives me, forcing people to this point. The country has no solution for unemployed men, let alone mentioning women's employment. Go back to the kitchen, but even a skilled woman can't cook without rice, and there is no chicken, duck, or fish to cook; cooking one or two meals of bitter rice doesn't take much time. The remaining labor is of course devalued and sold, and they are afraid that no one will buy it. Although lace merchants are suspected of exploiting women's surplus labor, they have put in a lot of effort and capital, which is still better than the zero-cost transactions of corrupt officials. Although they benefit themselves too much and benefit others too little, they still provide some benefits to others, and we don't need to be so harsh in demanding perfection from them. —I heard a few days ago that lace has stopped being distributed again, perhaps because the atmosphere of war by the river has become thicker again? As a result, the general public of poor women are living in fear all day long. From this, we can know that we should not sing high-pitched tunes.</p>
<p>It is sad that women make lace, but what about us men who write articles? An article fee is roughly equivalent to the wages for making a piece of lace. Moreover, it is not certain that it will be sold, and it is not as tough as the lace made by women. Even if every piece is sold, it can only be called "lace literature."</p>
<p>The "lace" that makes a rustling sound on the street is the real tough stuff. How great it would be if the wages of women's lace were rustling "lace"; the manuscript fees of men's "lace literature" were also rattling "lace."</p>
<p>Lace! Lace! Twentieth-century lace! This term, I am afraid, will not be clear to the scholars who edit the "Chinese Dictionary" in later generations.</p>
<h3>Fool and Others</h3>
<p>— Fei Yu</p>
<p>There are four idioms in Persian that say:</p>
<p>A person who doesn't know this thing and doesn't know that he doesn't know this thing is a fool; avoid him.</p>
<p>A person who doesn't know this thing but knows that he doesn't know this thing is a child; educate him.</p>
<p>A person who knows this thing but doesn't know that he knows this thing is a sleeper; wake him up.</p>
<p>A person who knows this thing and knows that he knows this thing is a smart person; follow him.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Light Sketches</h3>
<p>— Chen Qiji</p>
<p>A Cow That Understands Music</p>
<p>In the Ferihaca area of central Hungary, farmers are using music to help cows produce milk. Listening to music broadcast by wireless radio every evening can increase milk production by 10 to 15 percent. They also found that cows are only interested in certain types of music. Most of them like classical music, young cows like relaxing music, and old cows like jazz music.</p>
<p>Telephoto Camera</p>
<p>There are about 600 cameras for shooting the Bikini atomic bomb test, one of which is the world's largest telephoto camera. The machine weighs 200 pounds, the lens is 48 inches long, and can clearly photograph the second hand on a clock 8 inches in diameter from 1,500 feet away.</p>
<p>Turtle's Eyes</p>
<p>The color of animal eyes rarely differs by gender. However, the eyes of a species of turtle in Africa are different in color between males and females. The eyes of male turtles are red, while the eyes of female turtles are yellow.</p>
<h3>The Story of a Bank Draft</h3>
<p>— Lacking Shells</p>
<p>The school sent someone to deliver a bank draft for 50,000 yuan—the amount of salary for this month supplemented according to the new multiplier.</p>
<p>Upon seeing that the bank draft wasn't crossed, I was overjoyed, because according to common knowledge: not crossed means it can be cashed. So I hurriedly rushed out the door, called a rickshaw to go to the bank to cash it, because the market would close tomorrow, and it was already past 2 p.m.</p>
<p>As a result, the bank clerk said, "It's not easy to cash." I stated a long explanation about why a bank draft that isn't crossed should be cashed, but he wouldn't listen. I lowered my head and walked back, because the only two 500-yuan bills I had were already given to the rickshaw "gentleman." Now I couldn't even afford the streetcar.</p>
<p>Therefore, I aimlessly noted on the 50,000-yuan salary line: "Minus rickshaw fare: 1,000 yuan."</p>
<p>I asked my neighbors if they had any ideas. They all said it could be used to buy things, but they couldn't give change. That, of course, wouldn't work for me. I need to use these 50,000 yuan to cover various expenses for a month.</p>
<p>But my wife said, "It's not a solution to just keep the bank draft at home, especially since we have to pay cash for vegetables, oil, and salt tomorrow. Besides, the currency is depreciating day and night; we can't keep it." After careful consideration, I suddenly became overjoyed again: I had an idea. I just saw someone use a bank draft to buy silver dollars, so if I had silver dollars, wouldn't I have cash? I rushed to Henan Road again, "Do you have 'big heads'? Will a bank draft work?" The silver dealer nodded, but said there would be a discount. This would of course be a disadvantage, but I thought, why bother running around for a 50,000-yuan bank draft? So I agreed: 10,000 yuan was used as 9,000 yuan. The 50,000-yuan bank draft could buy four "big heads" at a price of 112 each, and he even gave me the preferential treatment of returning 520 yuan in change. This, I was already very satisfied with.</p>
<p>However, the silver dollars still had to be exchanged for cash in order to pay the landlord and feed myself. Therefore, I had to beg the silver dealer again: "Do you want 'big heads'? The silver market is rising, so I can sell them at a price of 111." Although I lost another 800 yuan, I thought this market price proved that I hadn't made a foolish deal.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to walk home again, but then I thought, why should a person be such a slave to money? I was already tired enough from running around today. So I boarded the streetcar, using 400 yuan of the 520 yuan the silver dealer had given me in change to ride the first-class streetcar home. As a "petty government employee" who could still ride the first-class streetcar, I felt quite content.</p>
<p>After returning home, I calculated again and made a few more notes under the salary amount:</p>
<p>Minus streetcar fare: 400 yuan;</p>
<p>Minus bank draft discount: 5,000 yuan;</p>
<p>Minus the loss from buying and selling silver dollars: 800 yuan;</p>
<p>Minus today's interest, calculated at 6 jiao, which should be 3,000 yuan;</p>
<p>Including the rickshaw fare of 1,000 yuan, a total of 10,200 yuan should be deducted. Therefore, the actual salary received from 50,000 yuan is 39,800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Inscribing on Lingxu's Painting of Pandas</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I accompanied Sanmu to Wanqingzhai, where the host showed us his recent painting of pandas. The brushwork was simple and the meaning complete, the ink dripping wet, which was particularly pleasing. This subject had never been fully explored by predecessors. Seeing it now suddenly felt quite new and different, yet it was still executed according to the laws and rules of the national painting style, truly matching the hidden intent of Shi Ke's crazy monk paintings. I composed an inscription on the spot. I heard that the host plans to recruit students to teach painting. In the future, his students will be influenced by him, and he will surely bring a unique and splendid color to the art world.</p>
<p>The four walls are bleak and empty, the vast blue sky is reflected.</p>
<p>Six times a day, the wind of heroism arises, connecting to the realm of primordial chaos.</p>
<p>Alas, the painter paints, capturing the fierceness of a fierce tiger.</p>
<p>Mice are merely mice, how can they restrain their running.</p>
<p>With a full belly, they must eventually stiffen, thus reaching ultimate stillness.</p>
<h3>"The Third Blow"</h3>
<p>— Wang Ce</p>
<p>—An Outstanding War Film</p>
<p>Soviet war films and Hollywood films differ greatly in temperament. Hollywood war films often "show off" too much, to the detriment of the theme's development. In the Soviet film "The Third Blow," the director captured the composure and strategy of the Soviet soldiers and their commanders, how they divided and encircled troops on the vast battlefield, and finally defeated the German defense.</p>
<p>On the battlefields of crossing rivers, climbing mountains, charging, and fighting, the director and cinematographer's efforts are visible everywhere.</p>
<p>Just looking at one aerial shot, one can see that the use of the camera has reached an outstanding level. The opening scene is the German-defended Kherim Fortress. The camera pans down from the aerial plane, and as it reaches the ground, the camera pans down from above the barbed wire, all the way into the trench. Then, it unfolds the German defense works, giving people a fresh and lively feeling.</p>
<p>The second is in the atmosphere. In the spring of 1944, the Soviet army was preparing to attack under the overall operational plan of the General Staff. The battlefield was very quiet, wildflowers were blooming everywhere, and the weather was warm. The young Soviet soldiers couldn't bear to rush into the enemy's position. Those scenes full of sentimentality were handled extremely cleanly and neatly. The silence of the earth before the advance, and the soldiers singing and marching shoulder to shoulder in the flowers after occupying Gureim, all show the film's superior tone.</p>
<p>This film shows how the German army suffered repeated defeats from the Siege of Leningrad to the Crimean campaign, shaking their confidence in swallowing the Soviet Union and the European continent. The actors' performances are refined, and the portrayal of Stalin is extremely lifelike. If the whole film could be connected by one or two characters, the dramatic effect would be even greater.</p>
