<p>〔中央社本市訊〕國防部政工局局長鄧文儀，昨在文教會招待記者席上檢討長江戰局，鄧氏分析要點：</p>
<p>（一）共匪渡江總攻撲空——共匪對於和談始終毫無誠意，毛澤東一月十四日申明，已肯定指出共軍作戰到底，並企圖「堅決·澈底·完全·干淨·殲滅國軍」，以達成其完全出賣中國陰謀。三月來並已澈底動員其在東北·華北·華東·華中匪區之人力物力，集中其軍事力量三分之二，準備渡江。本月廿日和談決裂，廿一日毛澤東下令總攻，滿望一舉突擊南京·由皖中安慶·蕪湖之間，蘇北江陰·鎮江之間兩處渡江，包圍我長江守備主力，實行殲滅戰，妄圖以其突擊南京，孤立武漢，淸算上海之詭計，長驅進擊華南。國軍早已洞悉其陰謀，避免在長江決戰，而將主力實行有計劃之戰略撤退，使其總攻撲空。雖匪軍正陸續渡過長江，然沒有打到國軍主力，此足證明共軍渡江戰略並無成就。</p>
<p>（二）國軍戰略撤退成功——國軍為打破匪之包圍殲滅戰略，實行長期持久消耗戰計，在長江中段由江陰到安慶之間，實行戰略撤退。一週來守江大軍均已安全撤至旣定防綫，除在蕪湖以西地區與江陰對岸及浦口橋頭堡小部守軍略有損傷及江陰要塞司令部所屬數營，新近編成之守備部隊通敵叛變外，國軍主力約十　軍，共二十餘萬人，均已撤到新防綫繼續作戰。因為國軍力量繼續存在，長期消耗戰從此開始，今後國軍除西南·西北·東南等必要之戰略據點須予繼續固守外，一城一地之得失，將無關整個戰局。今日之形勢，較之當年抗戰初期南京撤退之形勢為更好。</p>
<p>（三）上海防務鞏固足資堅守——共匪陰謀以上海物資豐富，或想不戰而佔上海，然後實行淸算，故迄今其使用在上海週圍之軍隊為數甚少，國軍在上海之實力甚為雄厚，長江中段國軍，近復大量來滬增援，各部隊均為實力充足，訓練有素之勁旅，加以內外圍工事良好，補給便利，陸海空軍之配合作戰，更為有利，故匪軍不來進犯上海則已，否則必將予以猛烈而慘重之打擊。由於人民之出錢出力，支援慰勞，官兵生活日有改善，士氣高昂，更為戰勝之保障，祇要軍民一體，集中力量，為保衛大上海而努力，堅守上海，必可打破共匪陰謀。</p>
<p>（四）共匪渡江以後困難日多——共匪輕易渡過長江，繼瀋陽平津以後，又佔領若干城市，其對華北人民之欺騙壓迫及其虛偽的城市政策，土改政策，卽將在江南開始實騐。人心之向背，由於江南人民過慣了自由生活，從此必將加增其對共匪之怨恨。共匪兵力分散，欲求到處實行軍事控制及軍事共產，其困難之程度必較華北·東北加多。國軍退到最後防綫，必將堅決抵抗，配合人民自衛力量的反抗，必使共黨共軍處處感到棘手，共匪夢想今年結束戰事，必不可能，戰事曠日持久，由於共匪的弱點更加暴露，國民黨與國軍及全國人民的覺醒，團結和進步反共救國運動，必將隨着國際反共潮流而高漲。</p>

<h3 id="c29">安定民生第一！ <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>和談不幸破裂，中共下令總攻，戰事乃由長江北岸移至江南，未及數日，國軍因戰略關係，相繼放棄京·鎮·常·錫等城，戰火逐漸東移，遂使上海市民的心情益見沉重，沒有一個不感到有燃眉之急。四郊居民扶老携幼，紛紛移入市區，街頭呈現一片戰時景色。不論理智如何清楚，不論意志如何堅強，對於當前的動亂，似終不免有些驚惶失措，即欲保持鎮靜亦不可得。</p>
<p>惟上海市民遭受戰亂與危難，今天并不是第一次；最近十幾年來，戰亂頻仍，飽經患難，一九二五年的國民革命軍北伐抵滬，一九三二年的「一·二八」淞滬之役，一九三七年的「八·一三」淞滬戰事再起，以及一九四　年的「一二·八」太平洋戰爭爆發，每次事變突起，無不將上海置於驚濤駭浪之中，幸而上海市民均有「風雨同舟」的精神，卒使上海渡過難關，保全了這個工商都市的元氣，未受任何重大損失。今天，我們又面臨這空前嚴重的難關，能否使上海不受戰禍的浩刦，實為上海市人民的一大考驗。</p>
<p>上海是一個擁有五百萬市民的都市，在戰火日益迫近的時候，如何維持治安，確是一個嚴重而緊要的問題。但是我們主為維持治安之道，首在安定民生。上海雖為全國經濟中心，江南首富之區，但近年來因為經濟情勢的惡化，一般人的生活遠非昔比，幾乎沒有一個人不受高物價的威脅。生活　不安定，是人人感到痛苦的；但至今日，戰火將延及上海，四郊即將淪為戰場，不僅市民生活每日所需的食米，蔬菜，柴草，等等的來源將中斷，而且郊區人民集中市區，消費更要大增，在供不應求的情形下，物價上漲，勢所難免。在政府決心應戰，人民支持反共的前提下，負責當局如不設法救濟難民和抑平物價，則那些無以為生的小民，或致挺而走險，造成社會的不安，更要加深上海的危機。所以，我們認為要維持治安，固須安定民生，要爭取勝利，更應安定民生。負責當局必須多多注意小民生計，除了儲存糧煤，實行配給口糧而外，還要積極疏散人口，舉辦平糶，替一般小民減少獲得生活資料的困難。這是維持秩序安定人心的根本要圖。</p>
<p>但是戰區物價的飛漲，究是不可避免的經濟現象，僅靠地方軍政當局以人為的力量努力努力抑平，仍不是治本之計，而最重要的，還是要靠社會上的富有者慷慨獻捐，充分發揮「風雨同舟」的精神，才能使上海五百萬市民，人人有飯可吃，人心安定，治安就沒有問題，勝利也能確有希望。目前因有若干富商巨戶，因鍳於大難臨頭，乃相率遠避，但只知逃命而不惜將其事業置於不顧的人，究屬少數。大多數的人，為了自己的事業，為了故鄉的將來，都是不顧離開上海的；既然留在上海，就得盡力協助地方當局維持秩序，消極方面，不能再在市場上興風作浪，拉抬物價，使小民不能生活下去，積極方面，更本着風雨同舟的精神，以有餘補不足，捐獻地方當局，用以救濟從郊區移入市區的難民以及一般無以為生的小民，務須達到人人有飯吃的目的。如此，民生安定，治安也就不會有問題。</p>
<p>上海社會上有一句流行的俗語，就是「窮靠富，富靠窮。」在平時或許還看不出，但在大難臨頭之際，這句俗語實含有無窮的真理。其實我們常說的「有錢出錢，有力出力，」和「風雨同舟」也是同樣的意義。不過在安定民生方面，我們終希望有錢的人多盡一點力！上有擁有如許的人力和物力，必須達成保衛上海的任務，不致遭受戰亂的浩劫。但這次卻是上海五百萬市民能否「風雨同舟」的一大考驗！</p>
<h3 id="c30">蘇建議召開四外長會議　討論整個德國問題　會期確定即解除柏林封鎖 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦廿六日電〕蘇聯廿六日減低其解除柏林封鎖之代價，并開啟門戶，使東西間得再談判許多懸而未決之困難問題。莫斯科電台廣播，蘇聯高級方面之聲明稱，如四強先同意於定期召開外長會議討論整個德國問題，則柏林之東西封鎖可予解除。廣播稱，聯合國蘇代表馬立克曾將此項建議轉交美代表傑塞普。蘇聯聲明本日特別提及柏林幣制問題應由外長會議解決之，該問題本係蘇聯封鎖柏林之籍口。莫斯科并謂，蘇聯所反對者僅西德政府之成立，此事之決定乃外長會議或討論之問題。在先前蘇聯顯堅持在解除封鎖前，必須先停止兩德政府之計劃。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿六日電〕塔斯社今日宣佈，蘇聯出席聯合國大會代表馬立克已向美國代表傑塞普提出建議，西方國家如能訂定一蘇聯可以接受之日期，舉行四強外長會議，討論整個德國問題，則蘇聯願於會議前解除柏林封鎖。西方國家對此均未表示意見。此項建議若果如塔斯社所傳，將為蘇聯之一大讓步。雙方談判之破裂，過去皆為時間問題。西方國家堅持須先解除封鎖，然後舉行四強會議，今蘇聯已提議解除封鎖及西方國家之反封鎖，然後由四強外長集會討論各種尚未解決之德國問題。此時間上之先後，蘇聯已在過去談判中曾力持反對。西方國家與西德領袖廿五夜已成立一歷史性之協定，完全撇開蘇聯佔領區，設立西德政府自訂憲法。蘇聯反對此一計劃，在外長會議中必將提出。據塔斯社稱，蘇聯曾特別建議，恢復柏林單一幣制間題，將留待四強外長會議解決。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿六日電〕塔斯社證實蘇代表馬立克曾向美代表傑塞普提出解除柏林封鎖之建議，此間外交界認為係一重要政治行動。此一問題由美蘇兩國代錶在聯合國休息室中商談，早為外交界所悉但未經有權威方面加以證實。國際觀察家認為蘇官方通訊社之發表此項消息，認為係與西德憲法之最後發展有關。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿六日電〕英美法三佔領強國暨西德政黨領袖十七人，已於今日就西德憲法獲致協議使德國政治領袖賡續八閱月以覓取堪為三強同意的憲草之工作，告一段落。今日三強總督與德國領袖會談達六小時之久，英督羅勃森事後表示此一充份而最後的協議，為佔領強國與德國人民關係間的一歷史性階段。</p>
<p>美督克萊預示憲法既已完成，德國共和國可望於七月中旬成立。成立以後盟國軍政府即將撤銷，盟管會將僅執行監督任務。今日討論之基礎，為德國領袖於接獲盟國外長放寬製憲限制之通知四十八小時後所擬之一折衷建議案，此一協議草案尚待西德制憲及盟國政府之正式批準，但協議既經成立，批準亦僅一種手續而已。據美督克萊宣佈，佔領當局與德國間就西德憲法之一切歧見已獲解決，憲法可望於五月十五日經制憲議會通過，而德國政府約可於七月中旬成立。憲法全文將由制憲議會及軍事總督在兩三天內發表，柏林并未被包括在西德國以內，但以後仍有參加之可能。被詢及今日之協定是否已關閉四強就德國獲致協定之可能性時，克萊答曰，若就四強進行談判之點言，并不因此有所變更。被詢及渠將於何時卸任駐德軍事總督之職務時，克萊答曰，余希望於五月十五日憲法成立時余仍在此間。總之，此一協定獲得非易，不失為使各關係方面均感愉快的解決辦法。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕官方今日宣稱：英國雖擬增援遠東艦隊，但將竭力避免與中共軍隊發生衝突。香港方面原駐巡洋艦兩艘，驅逐艦八艘，小型兵艦四艘，現擬增加航空母艦兩艘，巡洋艦一艘及潛水艇數艘，惟不擬增派軍隊開往香港，以免誤解為挑釁行為。英駐華大使史蒂文遜并擬與南京方面中共當局取得一種關係，以利行事。</p>

<p>〔合眾社倫敦廿五日電〕此間外交界相信，英國業已開始採取對西班牙軟化之態度。外交部發言人廿五日稱，英政府對西班牙之態度，與上月英外次梅友所摘述者相同。但各方面指出，即使梅氏之聲明表示英國之立場稍為軟化，此乃不再反對與西班牙恢復外交關係之謂。倫敦泰晤士報與每日電訊報廿五日聲稱，鑒於冷戰，加緊與西班牙間之關係乃必要者。同時軍界方面又加施壓力，將大西洋公約擴大，拉攏西班牙，據巴黎方面訊，該地官方亦具有同感，認為改變對西班牙關係之時機已到。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞廿六日電〕印尼共和國發言人今日再度聲明恢復日惹政府，乃解決印荷糾紛之先決條件，不知荷蘭何以不履行聯合國安理會決議，反而向吾人提出種種約束，例如要求停止游擊戰爭及參加海牙圓桌會議之類。荷蘭應知此項條件，非印尼政府所能接受。同時印尼總理哈泰昨日已到巴達維亞，指導印尼代表團對荷蘭之談判。哈泰與荷方代表范洛揚今日與聯合國調解國美籍代表舉行非正式會議。</p>

<p>〔合眾社東京廿五日電〕麥帥之外交長官頃正式致函蘇聯駐東京代表特萊夫揚柯，要求蘇聯供給有關至今仍在蘇聯領土日本戰俘死亡，失蹤及病重之「一切可能獲得」的情報，并指出莫斯科迄未供給此種情報，而最高統帥於實施日軍投降條件及波茨坦宣言時，對此事殊為關切。此函由盟國管制日本委員會主席兼美方委員塞巴爾德簽字，特萊夫揚柯係該會蘇方委員。函中請特氏向蘇聯政府設法取得必要之情報。據估計麥帥總部雖加緊設法遣回蘇境日戰俘，然仍有四十萬以上之日俘，被扣留於蘇聯控制各區。西太平洋及遠東美方各控制區日人之遣送回國事宜，已由官方於一九四七年一月八日宣佈辦理完畢。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕可靠方面息，自治領領袖今日在此舉行秘密會議後，已在原則上獲致協議，同意考慮發表一共同宣言，規定共和聯邦自由結合之基礎，使印度於成為共和國後，得繼續為共和聯邦之一員。</p>
<p>自治領總理今日兩度舉行會議，以覓取使印度共和國得以參加共和聯邦之公式。彼等於下午舉行兩小時之秘密會議後，至晚八時又舉行第二次會議。據悉，在該共同宣言內，印度暨其他自治領將繼續承認英王之特別地位為共和聯邦自由結合之標誌，但印度所不同於其他自治領者，即印度并不效忠英王。各自治領對此一建議之反響，尚不可知，惟悉印度於允諾繼續參加共和聯邦之時曾強調下列三點：（一）共和聯邦之合作，不能妨礙印度共和國之完全獨立；（二）印度雖繼續參加共和聯邦，但不能約束印度之必須參加共和聯邦所參加的軍事同盟；（三）根據共和聯邦之傳統，國際政策問題將視該問題本身之重要性而隨時加以處理。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦廿六日電〕聯邦總理會議在覓致一種方式，一方面維持王權——聯合之象徵，一方面滿足印度成為共和國之願望。但印度與巴基斯坦間之異見廿六日引起審慎情緒。聯邦總理會議本日在唐寗街十號舉行第四次全體大會，代表等仍希望可於廿七晚解決所余歧見。在目前階段中，似已獲致一項大體方式，能使共和國體制之印度仍與聯邦聯係，但巴勒斯坦有若干反對。貝文廿五日會晤巴勒斯坦代表，艾德禮首相後又與巴總理李嘉德作私人間商談，其中必有重大意義。傳李氏曾表明如印度堅持在聯邦內有特殊地位，則巴勒斯坦政府反對與印度分担聯防。巴印間另一歧見傳在於喀什米爾問題，巴勒斯坦懷疑西方邊境叛變事件之加強，印度參預其事。</p>

<p>〔合眾社馬尼刺廿六日電〕聯合國菲列賓首席代表羅慕洛廿六日主張組織亞洲非共產國家集團，而非反共國家集團，藉之為「兩種仇視的哲學間的觸媒劑」。渠在菲列賓大學畢業典禮中發表演說稱，「美國力量的集中于歐洲，使亞洲自由國家密切團結以保證渠等安全及共同防衛之自由實第迫切需要」。渠并稱，亞洲能夠在因思想衝突而分裂的世界中，協助謀致臨時的休戰及最後的和平。渠歸納此亞洲國家集團的觀念如次：（一）亞洲國家在互助中結成集團，協商未來的和平，容忍，及自由的途徑。（二）在本質上不採排他主義，在信仰上不採敵意。（三）對任何國家或國家集團，不採謟媚或自卑的態度。（四）「非共產性」但并非「反共產性」。（五）根據最近演成的自由社會型式的民主原則。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華股市況，昨日交易仍稀，</p>
<p>慹門股僅有了結交易，冷門股多種仍未做開。緣大局急轉後，人心寥落，大勢一致看疲。業內游資四散，業外亦多緊縮，散多了結，散空抵補。市程開後卽軟，中間抬面一再板持，喊價略高，但人心多未看好，逢高吐售尤湧，而納胃閉塞，走勢閒散。</p>
<p>永紗晨開三一〇元，抬面硬托，高至三三〇元，銀行幫吐售業外散戶跟了，一路小至二五〇元，證券幫逢低吸收，臨收微見挺秀，升至二七五元收盤。</p>
<p>中小型股操縱者少，幕後出而維持，收盤獨挺。美亞晨開六元，高見六元八角，中途出多進少，低見五元五角，臨收買氣轉旺，仍回升至高盤收市。新光以八元四角登塲，哄高至九元三角漲限，後因交易不多，臨收仍在高盤結束。景福開後見高，臨收乏力支持，轉入疲檔，終以五元三角收市。信和勤與景綸均未做開，雜股僅中法華瓷國貨台糖榮豐等五種，略有做開，其餘未見成交。</p>

<p>龍頭細布由三七〇萬開出後，一度微俏至三八〇萬，近午突急瀉至三〇〇萬，午收為三一〇萬，較上週末漲起一一〇萬，四君子嗶嘰晨開三六〇萬，最高達三八〇萬，中途曾迫入三〇〇萬關內，午收與龍頭細布軋平，餘布乏做開。</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 26th] Zhejiang Chairman Zhou Yan resolutely expressed his determination on the 26th to defend Greater Hangzhou and adopted a wartime system. It was decided to establish three administrative offices: the Eastern Zhejiang Administrative Office will be located in Ningbo, headed by Zhou Lingjun, the Special Commissioner of the Second District; the Southern Zhejiang Administrative Office will be located in Yongjia, headed by Zhou Qi, the Special Commissioner of the Fifth District; and the Western Zhejiang Administrative Office will be located in Yuqian, headed by Tan Naida, the Special Commissioner of the Ninth District.

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 26th] The city defense headquarters originally planned to be established in this city has now been decided not to be established in order to adapt to the environment. Instead, the Hangzhou Self-Defense Command will be established, with Mayor Yu Jimin concurrently serving as the Commander-in-Chief, and Zhu Chengde as the deputy. All volunteer police, fire brigades, self-defense units, police brigades, and criminal police corps are under unified command to mobilize citizens to participate in patrol teams to assist in patrols.</p>

Luo Yangbian, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Zhejiang Provincial Garrison Command, declared that the National Army has deployed defenses in the four suburbs of Hangzhou.

<p>[United Press, London, 25th] Prime Minister Attlee conferred with defense ministers at 10 Downing Street on the 25th regarding the progress of the Chinese Communist forces and the shelling of British warships on the Yangtze River. Attlee, who has been criticized by newspapers, the public, and the Conservative Party for the government's mishandling of the Yangtze incident, has drafted a statement to be presented to the House of Commons on Tuesday. It is reported that the defense ministers have agreed to the main demands of this draft.</p>
<p>Churchill is preparing to lead the attack on the government. There are signs that criticism from all sides may lead to a vote of no confidence in the beleaguered Labor government. Attlee and his cabinet must also consider how to deal with the British naval and air forces in the Pacific and how to ensure the safety of British citizens in areas of China threatened by the Communist forces. The full cabinet meeting originally scheduled for today has been postponed, possibly until Thursday, and will be replaced by a smaller meeting in an effort to address the Far East crisis.</p>

<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 25th] HMS Consort, the British destroyer that was damaged in an exchange of fire with Communist artillery units on the Yangtze River last week, arrived here today from Shanghai. British sailors on the pier cheered loudly to welcome it. Most of the ship's crew seemed quite tired, but they perked up when they saw British sailors on the pier giving them a thumbs-up. Several wounded crew members then appeared on deck, triggering another round of cheers. The first to board the ship was a mailman. An officer of the Consort recounted the ship's unsuccessful attempt to tow the HMS Amethyst, saying that the Consort was bombarded by the shore-based 105mm artillery for about two hours. The crew suffered ten dead and forty wounded. The Communist artillery was directly targeting the Consort, scoring several hits. The ship's wireless compass and firing control system were damaged, and there were two fires, one of which triggered an explosive. Despite the bombardment and casualties, the Consort attempted three times to tow the Amethyst out, but failed. They destroyed eight Communist artillery pieces before retreating.</p>

<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 25th] Chinese Communist soldiers invaded Ambassador Stuart's bedroom in Nanjing this morning and inspected other bedrooms. They did not take anything with them when they left.</p>
<p>A State Department spokesman said that the U.S. government had instructed the U.S. military attaché in Nanjing to "lodge a strong protest with the Chinese Communist military authorities."</p>
<p>The State Department revealed that a cable from Nanjing reported that twelve armed Communist soldiers "invaded" Stuart's residence at 6:45 a.m. They asked the servants how many Chinese and how many foreigners lived there and where the ambassador was.</p>
<p>According to the cable, they entered Stuart's room. The first one in spoke loudly and angrily, but the others were more polite. The soldiers roamed around the bedroom, inspecting objects, and said that the equipment in the room would eventually belong to the people because it should belong to the people.</p>
<p>State Department press liaison officer McDermott told reporters that this incident did not change the instructions the State Department had issued to Stuart, namely that "when he deems it appropriate, after he is assured that the safety and welfare of Americans in the lower Yangtze River region are protected," he should return here for consultations.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 26th] A U.S. Air Force spokesman said: The Far East U.S. Air Force Command has not yet received notification to assist Ambassador Stuart and other U.S. personnel in Shanghai to evacuate. A U.S. Air Force C-47 transport plane belonging to the military attaché in Nanjing is currently being repaired near Tokyo. Ambassador Stuart's B-17 plane remains at Nanjing Airport and is ready to depart at any time. The new Far East U.S. Air Force Commander, De Lameyer, is en route to Tokyo and is scheduled to arrive on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] The State Department has just received a report from Secretary of State Acheson and his advisors in China that they are concerned about the safety of 2,500 Americans in Shanghai. Although the Communist forces may temporarily bypass Shanghai, the danger is inevitable in the event of a disturbance. Ships originally stationed in the Huangpu River for emergency evacuation have been ordered to leave the range of artillery fire.</p>

<p>[Our Report] According to authoritative sources, as the situation has developed to this point, the true colors of the Communists have gradually been revealed. Although the Communist radio station in Peiping has been broadcasting widely in recent days, attempting to deceive people with leniency, their blatant disregard for public law, shelling of British warships, and sending troops armed with guns into Ambassador Stuart's bedroom in the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing, coercing the U.S. Ambassador not to leave the embassy compound, show that they are willingly controlled by the Soviet Union and reject the evil intentions of Britain and the United States. The freedom of the people is even more impossible to guarantee. For this reason, news came from Guangzhou yesterday that President Chiang will issue an important document in the coming days to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 26th] According to the Overseas Chinese Evening News, President Chiang has arrived in Xiamen.</p>

<p>[Our Report] New York, 26th Broadcast: The "New York Times" editorial today called on Western countries to take defensive measures in the Far East, as they have done in Europe. The editorial stated: The measures applicable to Europe and Germany are also applicable to the free nations of the Pacific and Japan, because the rise of the Communist Party in China has a more serious impact on the Far East than the gains of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia have on Western Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e15">ECA Division Moves to Guangzhou, Ralph H. Lapworth Flies to Guangzhou, the Shanghai Office of St. Louis will Continue Material Assistance Work <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[City Report] The head of the ECA (Economic Cooperation Administration) China Division, Ralph H. Lapworth, yesterday appointed St. Louis as the head of the Shanghai Office of the agency. The office will supervise the allocation of American-aid food, cotton, and petroleum. A number of American supply experts are now employed there.</p>
<p>Currently, the administrative departments of the ECA related to policy and bookkeeping are moving to Guangzhou. The agency can maintain contact with the Chinese government in Guangzhou in accordance with the Sino-American Economic Aid Agreement, and its aid-to-China duties and communications can be carried out more effectively there.</p>
<p>St. Louis was originally the leader of the division's supply management and promotion group. He emphasized that there are sufficient reserves of food, cotton, and petroleum currently here or on the way to Shanghai to maintain the Shanghai rationing plan, yarn mill work, and electricity supply. It is said: "The ECA will continue to assist the Shanghai region with American-aid materials until its funds are exhausted or until it can no longer carry out its work in accordance with the terms of the Sino-American bilateral agreement. This agreement guarantees that relief materials should be fairly distributed in the best interests of the Chinese people, subject to the conditions stipulated by the U.S. Congress." Ralph H. Lapworth flew to Guangzhou yesterday morning with the advance personnel of the headquarters.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] Cleveland, Director of China Aid at the Economic Cooperation Administration, declared on the 25th: The value of aid goods now in Shanghai is approximately US$12.6 million, mostly cotton, with a small portion of rice, flour, and fertilizer. When the Communist forces entered Nanjing, there were virtually no ECA supplies left in the city. The ECA will retain a symbolic staff in Shanghai to distribute the remaining supplies.

<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 26th] The Xinjiang Province has been approved by the central government to implement currency reform starting on May 1st. All old provincial currency will be recalled completely within three months from May 1st, and silver dollar notes will be issued with full backing and unlimited redemption in order to completely stabilize the currency value. A mint has now been officially established and is mass-producing silver coins. The salaries of all provincial and county-level government employees and the accounting system throughout Xinjiang will henceforth be denominated in silver coins, and various payment standards have been set. The salaries of senior and junior officials range from a minimum of nine yuan to a maximum of eighteen yuan. Henceforth, all central government grant standards will not apply to Xinjiang Province. It is reported that after the implementation of currency reform in Xinjiang Province, the handling of gold yuan will be decided to remain in circulation, but cannot be exchanged for silver dollars or silver dollar notes. Gold yuan can only be used for domestic remittance, and the exchange rate will be determined daily by the provincial bank. However, this method is still subject to the approval of the central government.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Xinjiang Mint began minting coins last month. The newly minted silver coin weighs 7 mace 2 candareens, with the words "Made by Xinjiang Provincial Mint" written on the front, with the large character "Yi" in the middle, and the words "Year 38 of the Republic of China" below. The back is the Uighur version of the front. It is said that the silver content is 90%, which is better than the ones circulating in the interior.</p>

<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 25th] General Chennault said at a press conference held by the San Francisco Newspaper Guild on the 25th that the situation in the Far East "is driving us to a third world war with certainty and speed far exceeding the situation in Europe," and said: Now is the time for the United States to accept the leadership of "resisting communism throughout the world." He said: If the situation in the Far East continues to deteriorate, then "the American people on the Pacific coast can be sure that the Third World War will begin because the Communist Party controls the Pacific." "A new military and economic threat has risen in the Pacific region, far more powerful than the Japanese threat that we fought to eradicate."</p>
<p>Chennault said: "All of China's tragedy was caused by our own mistakes." He said that the current situation in China is not completely hopeless. During the War of Resistance, the territory retained by the National Government at one point was even less than it is now. He said that China must receive American aid immediately.

<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reviewed the battle situation on the Yangtze River at a reception for reporters held at the Cultural and Educational Association yesterday. Mr. Deng's analysis points:</p>
<p>(1) The Communist bandits' general attack to cross the river failed - The Communist bandits have consistently lacked sincerity in the peace talks. Mao Zedong stated on January 14th that he had definitively pointed out that the Communist army would fight to the end and attempted to "resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly annihilate the National Army" to achieve its conspiracy to completely sell out China. Since March, it has thoroughly mobilized the manpower and material resources in its bandit areas in Northeast China, North China, East China, and Central China, concentrating two-thirds of its military strength to prepare to cross the river. On the 20th of this month, the peace talks broke down. On the 21st, Mao Zedong ordered a general attack, hoping to launch a sudden attack on Nanjing, crossing the river in two places: between Anqing and Wuhu in central Anhui, and between Jiangyin and Zhenjiang in northern Jiangsu, to surround and annihilate the main force of our Yangtze River defense, and to carry out its conspiracy of attacking Nanjing to isolate Wuhan and liquidate Shanghai, and then advancing rapidly into South China. The National Army had already seen through its conspiracy, avoided a decisive battle on the Yangtze River, and carried out a planned strategic retreat, causing its general attack to fail. Although the bandit army is gradually crossing the Yangtze River, it has not hit the main force of the National Army, which proves that the Communist army's strategy of crossing the river has not been successful.</p>
<p>(2) The National Army's strategic retreat was successful - In order to break the bandit's strategy of encirclement and annihilation, and to implement a long-term and sustained war of attrition, the National Army implemented a strategic retreat in the middle section of the Yangtze River, from Jiangyin to Anqing. In the past week, the defending army on the river has safely retreated to the designated defense line. Except for some losses to a small number of defending troops west of Wuhu and on the opposite bank of Jiangyin, and the bridgehead of Pukou, and the defection of several battalions belonging to the Jiangyin Fortress Command, which were newly formed defense units, the main force of the National Army, about ten armies, totaling more than 200,000 men, has retreated to the new defense line to continue fighting. Because the strength of the National Army continues to exist, a long-term war of attrition has begun. In the future, except for necessary strategic strongholds in the Southwest, Northwest, and Southeast, which must continue to be defended, the gains and losses of one city or one place will not affect the overall war situation. Today's situation is better than the situation during the retreat from Nanjing in the early days of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(3) The defense of Shanghai is solid and can be defended - The Communist bandits are conspiring to take Shanghai without a fight because of its abundant resources, and then liquidate it. Therefore, the number of troops they have used around Shanghai so far is very small. The strength of the National Army in Shanghai is very strong. The National Army in the middle section of the Yangtze River has recently sent a large number of reinforcements to Shanghai. All units are strong, well-trained, and are well-coordinated between ground, sea, and air forces, so the Communist army will not invade Shanghai, otherwise they will be given a fierce and heavy blow. Thanks to the people's money and efforts, support, and comfort, the lives of officers and soldiers are improving day by day, and their morale is high, which is a guarantee of victory. As long as the military and civilians are united, concentrate their efforts, and work to defend greater Shanghai, they will be able to break the Communist bandits' conspiracy by steadfastly defending Shanghai.</p>
<p>(4) The Communist bandits will face more difficulties after crossing the river - The Communist bandits easily crossed the Yangtze River and, after Shenyang and Tianjin, occupied some more cities. Their deception and oppression of the people in North China and their hypocritical urban policies and land reform policies will soon begin to be tested in Jiangnan. The people's support and opposition will inevitably increase their resentment towards the Communist bandits since the people of Jiangnan are accustomed to a free life. The Communist bandits' forces are dispersed, and the degree of difficulty in trying to implement military control and military communism everywhere will be greater than in North China and Northeast China. The National Army will resolutely resist when it retreats to the final defense line, and coupled with the resistance of the people's self-defense forces, it will inevitably make the Communist Party and the Communist army feel thorny everywhere. It is impossible for the Communist bandits to dream of ending the war this year. As the war drags on, the weaknesses of the Communist bandits will be further exposed, and the awakening, unity, progress, and anti-communist and national salvation movement of the Kuomintang, the National Army, and the people of the whole country will surely rise with the international anti-communist trend.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Stabilizing People's Livelihood Comes First! <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The peace talks unfortunately broke down, and the Chinese Communists ordered a general offensive. The war has shifted from the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south of the Yangtze River. In less than a few days, the National Army, for strategic reasons, successively abandoned cities such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and Wuxi. The flames of war are gradually moving east, making the citizens of Shanghai feel more and more heavy-hearted, and everyone feels a sense of urgency. Residents of the suburbs, supporting the old and carrying the young, have moved into the urban area, presenting a wartime scene on the streets. No matter how clear the reason is, no matter how strong the will is, it seems that some panic is unavoidable in the face of the current turmoil, and it is impossible to remain calm even if one wants to.</p>
<p>However, this is not the first time that the citizens of Shanghai have suffered from war and danger. In the past ten years or so, wars have been frequent and they have endured many hardships. The Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army reached Shanghai in 1925, the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident in 1932, the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle broke out again in 1937, and the outbreak of the "December 8th" Pacific War in 1941. Each time an incident suddenly occurred, Shanghai was placed in the midst of a stormy sea. Fortunately, the citizens of Shanghai have the spirit of "sharing weal and woe," which ultimately enabled Shanghai to overcome difficulties, preserve the vitality of this industrial and commercial city, and avoid any major losses. Today, we are facing this unprecedentedly serious difficulty again. Whether Shanghai can be spared from the catastrophe of war is a major test for the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city with five million citizens. How to maintain public order when the flames of war are approaching is indeed a serious and important issue. However, we believe that the way to maintain public order is to first stabilize people's livelihood. Although Shanghai is the economic center of the country and the richest area in Jiangnan, in recent years, due to the deterioration of the economic situation, the lives of ordinary people are far from what they used to be, and almost everyone is threatened by high prices. Instability of life is what everyone feels painful. But today, the flames of war will spread to Shanghai, and the suburbs are about to become battlefields. Not only will the sources of food, vegetables, firewood, etc., which are needed daily by the citizens, be cut off, but also the people in the suburbs will concentrate in the urban area, and consumption will increase greatly. In the situation where supply cannot meet demand, price increases are inevitable. Under the premise that the government is determined to fight and the people support anti-communism, if the responsible authorities do not find ways to help the refugees and suppress prices, those civilians who have no means of living may be forced to take risks, causing social unrest and deepening the crisis in Shanghai. Therefore, we believe that to maintain public order, it is necessary to stabilize people's livelihood; to win victory, it is even more necessary to stabilize people's livelihood. The responsible authorities must pay more attention to the livelihood of the civilians. In addition to storing grain and coal and implementing rationed food, they must also actively evacuate the population, organize the sale of cheap grain, and reduce the difficulty for the civilians to obtain living materials. This is the fundamental plan to maintain order and stabilize people's hearts.</p>
<p>However, the soaring prices in the war zone are inevitable economic phenomena. Relying solely on the local military and political authorities to try to suppress them with artificial forces is still not a fundamental solution. The most important thing is to rely on the wealthy in society to generously donate and fully exert the spirit of "sharing weal and woe" so that all five million citizens of Shanghai can have food to eat, people's hearts can be stabilized, there will be no problem with public order, and victory can be truly hoped for. At present, some wealthy merchants and magnates, seeing that disaster is imminent, have fled one after another, but only a few people know to escape for their lives without caring about their careers. Most people, for the sake of their careers and the future of their hometown, do not care about leaving Shanghai. Since they stay in Shanghai, they must do their best to assist the local authorities in maintaining order. On the negative side, they must no longer stir up trouble in the market, raising prices and making it impossible for civilians to live. On the positive side, they should donate to the local authorities based on the spirit of sharing weal and woe to help the refugees who have moved from the suburbs to the urban area and the civilians who have no means of living, and must achieve the goal that everyone has food to eat. In this way, people's livelihood will be stable, and there will be no problem with public order.</p>
<p>There is a popular saying in Shanghai society, which is "the poor rely on the rich, and the rich rely on the poor." In ordinary times, it may not be obvious, but in times of great difficulty, this saying contains infinite truth. In fact, what we often say, "those who have money contribute money, and those who have strength contribute strength," and "sharing weal and woe" have the same meaning. However, in terms of stabilizing people's livelihood, we ultimately hope that those who have money will contribute more! Shanghai has so much manpower and material resources and must accomplish the task of defending Shanghai so that it will not suffer the catastrophe of war. But this time is a major test of whether the five million citizens of Shanghai can "share weal and woe!"</p>
<h3 id="e30">The Soviet Union Suggests Convening a Meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers to Discuss the Entire German Issue; The Berlin Blockade Will Be Lifted as Soon as the Date is Set <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] The Soviet Union reduced the price of lifting the Berlin blockade on the 26th and opened the door for the East and West to renegotiate many outstanding difficult issues. Moscow Radio broadcast a statement from senior Soviet officials stating that the East-West blockade of Berlin could be lifted if the four powers first agreed to convene a meeting of foreign ministers at a fixed date to discuss the entire German issue. The broadcast said that Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik had forwarded this proposal to U.S. representative Jessup. The Soviet statement specifically mentioned today that the Berlin currency issue should be resolved by the foreign ministers' meeting, which was the excuse for the Soviet blockade of Berlin. Moscow also said that the Soviet Union only opposed the establishment of a West German government, and the decision on this matter should be discussed at the foreign ministers' meeting. Previously, the Soviet Union insisted that the plans for the two German governments must be stopped before the blockade was lifted.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 26th] TASS announced today that Soviet representative to the United Nations Malik has proposed to U.S. representative Jessup that if the Western countries can set a date acceptable to the Soviet Union to hold a meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss the entire German issue, the Soviet Union is willing to lift the Berlin blockade before the meeting. The Western countries have not expressed any opinion on this. If this proposal is as reported by TASS, it will be a major concession by the Soviet Union. The breakdown of the negotiations between the two sides in the past was due to the timing issue. The Western countries insisted that the blockade must be lifted first, and then the four-power meeting should be held. Now the Soviet Union has proposed lifting the blockade and the Western countries' counter-blockade, and then the four foreign ministers will meet to discuss various unresolved German issues. The Soviet Union has strongly opposed this order of priority in past negotiations. The Western countries and West German leaders have established a historic agreement on the 25th night, completely bypassing the Soviet occupation zone to establish a West German government with its own constitution. The Soviet Union opposes this plan and will raise it at the foreign ministers' meeting. According to TASS, the Soviet Union has specifically suggested that the issue of restoring a unified currency in Berlin should be left to the four foreign ministers' meeting to resolve.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] TASS confirmed that Soviet representative Malik had proposed to U.S. representative Jessup to lift the Berlin blockade. Diplomatic circles here believe that this is an important political action. The fact that this issue was discussed by representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union in the United Nations lounge has long been known to diplomatic circles, but it has not been confirmed by authoritative sources. International observers believe that the publication of this news by the Soviet official news agency is related to the final development of the West German constitution.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Allied Powers and German Leaders Eliminate Differences; West German Constitution Draft Completed; German Federal Republic Established in Mid-July <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The three occupying powers, Britain, the United States, and France, and seventeen leaders of West German political parties reached an agreement today on the West German constitution, bringing to an end the work of German political leaders who have been searching for eight months for a draft constitution acceptable to the three powers. Today, the three powers' governors held talks with German leaders for six hours. Governor Robertson of Britain said afterwards that this full and final agreement is a historic stage in the relationship between the occupying powers and the German people.</p>
<p>Governor Clay of the United States predicted that with the completion of the constitution, the German Republic is expected to be established in mid-July. After its establishment, the Allied military government will be revoked, and the Allied Control Council will only perform supervisory tasks. The basis for today's discussion was a compromise proposal drafted by the German leaders 48 hours after receiving the Allied foreign ministers' notice to relax the constitutional restrictions. This draft agreement still needs to be formally approved by the West German constitutional assembly and the Allied governments, but since the agreement has been established, approval is only a formality. According to U.S. Governor Clay, all differences between the occupying authorities and Germany on the West German constitution have been resolved. The constitution is expected to be passed by the constitutional assembly on May 15th, and the German government is expected to be established around mid-July. The full text of the constitution will be published by the constitutional assembly and the military governors in two or three days. Berlin is not included in West Germany, but it may still participate in the future. When asked if today's agreement has closed the possibility of the four powers reaching an agreement on Germany, Clay replied that it has not changed in terms of the four powers conducting negotiations. When asked when he will step down as the military governor of Germany, Clay replied that he hopes to still be here on May 15th when the constitution is established. In short, this agreement was not easy to obtain and is a solution that makes all parties involved happy.</p>

The powers of the High Commission will not conflict with the occupation regulations and international treaties. In order to make the West German government more responsible for domestic affairs and reduce occupation costs, the number of personnel of the High Commission will be reduced as much as possible.

<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The Navy Department issued a formal statement today clarifying the mission of British warships in China, saying that British warships in Nanjing and Shanghai are solely responsible for assisting the British Commonwealth people in the event of social unrest during the change of regime. As soon as the environment permits, it plans to withdraw the British fleet and restore the normal procedure of warships visiting foreign ports.</p>
<p>The Navy Department also announced that the Fiji-class cruiser "Jamaica" with a displacement of 8,000 tons, led by Captain Barons, has been ordered to sail from Bermuda to the Far East. The ship is equipped with nine 6-inch guns and will sail to the Far East at the highest speed. The exact date of departure has not been determined. There are a total of six Fiji-class cruisers, namely "Gambia," "Bermuda," "Kenya," "Mauritius," and "Nigeria." Normally, each ship has a crew of 730 people, which increases to 980 people in wartime. In addition to nine 6-inch guns, it is also equipped with eight 4-inch high-angle guns, four 3-pounder mortars, sixteen to forty-one 40mm anti-aircraft machine guns, and six 21-inch torpedo tubes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 25th] Officials declared today that although Britain plans to reinforce the Far East Fleet, it will try its best to avoid conflict with the Chinese Communist forces. Hong Kong originally stationed two cruisers, eight destroyers, and four small warships. It is now planned to add two aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and several submarines, but it does not plan to send troops to Hong Kong to avoid being misunderstood as a provocative act. British Ambassador to China Stevenson also plans to establish a relationship with the Chinese Communist authorities in Nanjing to facilitate action.</p>

More than 400 senior military officers, scientists, and others participated in this indoor exercise.

<h3 id="e36">U.S. Senate Begins Deliberation on the North Atlantic Defense Treaty <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] The U.S. Senate has begun deliberating on the North Atlantic Treaty. Most senators apparently favor approving the treaty, but in general, senators understand that this treaty involves an unprecedented precedent in U.S. history and a fateful resolution, so it must be thoroughly analyzed and debated. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee now plans to widely hear opinions from all parties on this treaty. Some well-informed senators believe that 12 to 20 of the 96 senators will oppose this treaty. The treaty must be approved by a two-thirds majority before it can be ratified. The main reason that can promote the Senate's approval of this treaty is that the Soviet Union's foreign policy and the goal of world revolution have created a real threat to the peace and internal security of the United States and Western European democracies.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 25th] Diplomatic circles here believe that Britain has begun to adopt a softer attitude towards Spain. A Foreign Office spokesman said on the 25th that the British government's attitude towards Spain is the same as that outlined by Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mayhew last month. But all parties pointed out that even if Mr. Mayhew's statement indicated a slight softening of Britain's position, it meant no longer opposing the restoration of diplomatic relations with Spain. The London Times and the Daily Telegraph claimed on the 25th that in view of the Cold War, it is necessary to strengthen relations with Spain. At the same time, the military has also increased pressure to expand the Atlantic Treaty and draw in Spain. According to news from Paris, officials there also feel the same way, believing that the time has come to change relations with Spain.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 26th] A spokesman for the Republic of Indonesia reiterated today that the restoration of the Yogyakarta government is a prerequisite for resolving the British-Dutch dispute. He wondered why the Netherlands did not implement the United Nations Security Council resolution and instead made various restrictions on us, such as requiring us to stop guerrilla warfare and participate in the Hague Round Table Conference. The Netherlands should know that this condition is unacceptable to the Indonesian government. At the same time, Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta arrived in Batavia yesterday to guide the Indonesian delegation's negotiations with the Netherlands. Hatta and Dutch representative Van Royen held an informal meeting today with the American representative of the United Nations Mediation Commission.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Soviet-Japanese War; 400,000 Not Yet Repatriated; Allied Headquarters Asks the Soviet Union to Provide Information <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur's foreign affairs official recently formally wrote to Soviet representative in Tokyo Terevjanko, requesting the Soviet Union to provide "all possible" information about the deaths, missing persons, and seriously ill Japanese prisoners of war still in Soviet territory, and pointed out that Moscow has not provided this information, and the Supreme Commander is very concerned about this matter when implementing the Japanese surrender conditions and the Potsdam Declaration. This letter was signed by Sebald, chairman of the Allied Control Council for Japan and the U.S. member. Terevjanko is the Soviet member of the council. The letter requested Mr. Terevjanko to try to obtain the necessary information from the Soviet government. It is estimated that although MacArthur's headquarters has stepped up efforts to repatriate Japanese prisoners of war in Soviet territory, more than 400,000 Japanese prisoners of war are still being detained in Soviet-controlled areas. The repatriation of Japanese people from the U.S.-controlled areas in the Western Pacific and the Far East was officially announced on January 8, 1947.</p>
<h3 id="e41">India Maintains Ties with the Commonwealth, Not Hindering Independent Status, London Conference to Issue Joint Declaration <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Reliable sources report that Commonwealth leaders, after holding a secret meeting here today, have reached an agreement in principle to consider issuing a joint declaration. This declaration will establish the basis for a free association of the Commonwealth, allowing India to remain a member of the Commonwealth after becoming a republic.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Prime Ministers held two meetings today to find a formula enabling the Republic of India to participate in the Commonwealth. They held a two-hour secret meeting in the afternoon, followed by a second meeting at 8:00 PM. It is understood that in the joint declaration, India and other Dominions will continue to recognize the special status of the British monarch as a symbol of the free association of the Commonwealth. However, India differs from other Dominions in that it does not pledge allegiance to the British monarch. The reaction of various Dominions to this proposal is not yet known. However, it is understood that India emphasized the following three points when promising to continue participating in the Commonwealth: (1) Cooperation within the Commonwealth must not hinder the complete independence of the Republic of India; (2) Although India continues to participate in the Commonwealth, it cannot be bound to participate in military alliances that the Commonwealth joins; (3) According to Commonwealth tradition, international policy issues will be handled on a case-by-case basis depending on their importance.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference is seeking a way to maintain the symbol of the Crown while satisfying India's desire to become a republic. However, disagreements between India and Pakistan caused cautious sentiment on the 26th. The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference held its fourth plenary session at 10 Downing Street today. Delegates still hope to resolve remaining differences by the evening of the 27th. At this stage, a general approach seems to have been reached that would allow India, with its republican system, to remain affiliated with the Commonwealth, but Pakistan has some objections. Bevin met with Palestinian representatives on the 25th, and Prime Minister Attlee later held private talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, which must have been of great significance. It is rumored that Khan has indicated that if India insists on a special status within the Commonwealth, the Pakistani government opposes sharing joint defense with India. Another disagreement between Pakistan and India is reportedly related to the Kashmir issue, with Pakistan suspecting Indian involvement in the increased western border insurgency.</p>

<p>[United Press, Manila, 26th] The Philippines' Chief Delegate to the United Nations, Carlos Romulo, advocated on the 26th for the organization of a non-communist, rather than an anti-communist, group of Asian nations, as a "catalyst between two hostile philosophies." In a speech at the graduation ceremony of the University of the Philippines, he stated, "The concentration of American power in Europe makes it imperative for free Asian nations to unite closely to guarantee their security and common defense of freedom." He also stated that Asia can assist in achieving a temporary truce and lasting peace in a world divided by ideological conflict. He summarized the concept of this Asian nations' group as follows: (1) Asian nations form a group in mutual assistance, negotiating the paths to future peace, tolerance, and freedom. (2) Not exclusive in nature, nor hostile in belief. (3) Not adopting a flattering or self-deprecating attitude towards any nation or group of nations. (4) "Non-Communist" but not "Anti-Communist." (5) Based on the democratic principles of recently evolved free societies.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] Japanese labor unions have announced that they will use the large-scale May Day parade as a springboard to resist the Allied Headquarters' directive regarding the "Austerity Export Plan." They estimate that 600,000 workers in the Tokyo area alone will participate in the parade and demonstrations. The unions will use this parade to organize resistance against MacArthur's plan to reduce wages in state-owned and private industries, balance the budget, promote industrial production, and expand Japanese exports. Left-wing and right-wing unions, as well as civil service unions (representing approximately six million members), have announced that they will participate in the parade. The May Day parade will call on all workers to join a united front, overthrow the Yoshida government, oppose the proposed strengthening of labor laws, and demand a minimum wage system. The main attacks will focus on "opposing the austerity export plan based on low wages" and "the government and enterprises' restructuring plans through the dismissal of large numbers of personnel."</p>

<p>[U.S. Information Service, Flushing Meadow, 25th] The United Nations General Assembly has requested the Soviet Union to allow Soviet wives of foreign nationals to leave the Soviet Union and follow their husbands overseas.

During a full-day debate on the issue, Soviet representative Sharapkin called the Chilean complaint a "low-level farce." Eleanor Roosevelt, speaking for the U.S. delegation, recounted that while this proposal had been passed by the General Assembly's Legal Committee at the Paris Conference in December of last year by an "overwhelming majority," the Soviet Union has refused to issue exit permits to 65 Soviet husbands of American citizens and 350 Soviet wives who wish to leave the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday, the Central Bank announced the issuance of 100,000 yuan banknotes. Funds from all parties were settled after two days. The situation turned slightly better, so prices stirred again. Financial items such as gold, banknotes, and silver dollars, in particular, had been suppressed for many days, so their prices rose strongly. Cash chips remain scarce. However, as the Central Bank concentrates all its efforts on coping with the disbursement of funds for the central military and political organs in Shanghai and the allocation of huge emergency funds for various business units, the amount of cash withdrawn from the Bank by various firms yesterday was still 10% of the previous day's balance. However, a considerable amount of cash obtained by all parties is also flowing back into the market, so the cash crunch has eased slightly.</p>
<p>Regarding bank draft transactions, the City Chamber of Commerce and the City Industrial Association jointly announced that they should be maintained, and various factories and shops must not refuse to accept them. Many parties also believe that refusing to accept bank drafts is not only a matter of unnecessary self-disturbance but also borders on disrupting the financial system, and the authorities will punish them accordingly. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, various parties have no longer firmly refused to buy and sell with bank drafts. However, general retail prices have risen by several percent to one-fold because the discount rate for bank drafts has been rekindled and yesterday's general prices have improved again.</p>
<p>Currently, the situation of check clearing in this city is that all parties have made preparations in advance, and fortunately, there has not been a repeat of the 40-50% return rate. The amount of returned checks on this day accounted for about 20% of the exchange amount.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Gold Prices Slightly Stabilized <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday's gold market conditions were more stable than the previous day. Because major players have left Shanghai one after another, they have no intention of trading. Retail investors have limited strength and are only making scattered transactions. The market is calm and there are no major changes.</p>
<p>Spot prices outside the market were initially quoted at 40 million and 45 million, and then gradually declined. Halfway through the day, prices were transacted at 320 million and 370 million. The final quotes near noon were only transacted at 280 million and 330 million.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar market was even more chaotic. No official trading was heard. Quotes were 700,000 for bidding and 750,000 for asking. The above were all settled with current bank drafts. Gold was exchanged for silver dollars, and prices dropped as low as 340,000 and 370,000.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Silver Dollars Rise Madly <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Silver dollars rose madly again on the street yesterday. Because emergency funds from all parties continued to flow out in large quantities, and the market was active, and because the situation turned stable, the holders were unwilling to easily sell. Under conditions of short supply and strong demand, the market rose sharply. Silver dollars rose from 430,000 and 480,000 in the morning to 600,000 and 650,000 at noon. In the afternoon, the price rose even higher, reaching 700,000 and 750,000. Small silver dollars were quoted at 500,000 and 550,000. Foreign silver dollars were quoted at 400,000 and 450,000. In bank draft transactions, silver dollars broke through the 1 million mark, reaching as high as 1 million and 1.2 million, a sharp increase of about one-fold.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, gold jewelry stores still did not post prices for trading. According to Mr. Wu Pengnian, the chairman of the industry association, speaking to our reporter: Recently, due to the stagnation of the gold market, and the inability to resume trading in gold jewelry, the industry's business has also stalled invisibly. However, in yesterday's various industry markets, some have returned to normal. It is possible that gold jewelry trading will resume today. Other money exchange businesses have not resumed posting prices for trading either.</p>

<h3 id="e63">The Shanghai Stock Market Weakens <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai stock market situation was still sparse yesterday. Only the popular stocks saw closing transactions, and many unpopular stocks still did not resume trading. After the sudden turn of events, people are disheartened, and the overall trend is uniformly pessimistic. Capital within the industry is scattered, and capital outside the industry is also tightening. Small investors are mostly liquidating, and short positions are covering. The market softened immediately after opening. In the middle, the face was repeatedly supported, and the quoted prices were slightly higher, but people were mostly not optimistic and selling at higher prices was particularly strong. Absorption was blocked, and the trend was idle.</p>
<p>Yong Yarn opened in the morning at 310 yuan, with strong surface support, rising to 330 yuan. Bank groups sold, and retail investors followed, falling all the way to 250 yuan. Securities firms absorbed at lower prices, and near the close, there was a slight rebound, closing at 275 yuan.</p>
<p>There are few manipulators of small and medium-sized stocks. Those behind the scenes came forward to maintain them, and the close was uniquely strong. Meiya opened in the morning at 6 yuan, reaching 6 yuan 8 jiao. Along the way, there was more selling than buying, falling to 5 yuan 5 jiao. Near the close, buying interest turned strong and returned to a high closing price. Xinguang debuted at 8 yuan 4 jiao, pushing up to the daily limit of 9 yuan 3 jiao. Later, because there were not many transactions, it ended at a high price near the close. Jingfu saw highs after opening, but lacked support near the close, turning into a weak position, finally closing at 5 yuan 3 jiao. Xinnuoqin and Jinglun did not resume trading. Among the miscellaneous stocks, only China-France China Ceramics National Products Taiwan Sugar Rongfeng and other five varieties saw some trading. The rest did not see any transactions.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Yong Yarn initially traded at 285 yuan, falling all the way to a close of 248 yuan, a further squeeze compared to the morning market. Xinguang initially traded at 8 yuan 8 jiao, closing at the same daily limit as the morning. Jingfu saw softness after opening, and the late close was a further slight 3 jiao lower than the morning price. Meiya's late close was 6 yuan, still a slight 8 jiao lower than the afternoon price. China-France continued to fall in the afternoon market, finally closing at the limit down.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Yarn Market Stalled <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to be stalled, and all parties remained in a wait-and-see attitude, due to the impact of the suspension of bill discounting by firms.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Cloth Market Idle <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market is still firm, as people are slightly more stable, and credit is showing signs of easing. Various cloths opened at high prices. Later, because transactions and payments were all based on same-day bank drafts, and especially since same-day bank drafts from firms could absolutely not be discounted, there were difficulties in cash flow turnover, and customer demand was very light. Therefore, the trend went from high to loose, and transactions were also few.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth opened at 3.7 million, once slightly lively to 3.8 million, suddenly plunged near noon to 3 million. The noon close was 3.1 million, up 1.1 million from last weekend. Four Gentlemen Serge opened in the morning at 3.6 million, reaching a maximum of 3.8 million, once forced into the 3 million level in the middle. The noon close was on par with Longtou fine cloth. The remaining cloths lacked trading.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Rice Market Mostly Priced in Silver Dollars, White Rice Sees Another Decline <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The rice market saw more transactions yesterday, all priced in terms of conversion to Yuan silver dollars. Most cargo owners were settling accounts due to the current situation, and selling to get silver, so there were many sellers, and prices declined. White rice opened at 5 yuan 5 jiao and closed at 5 yuan. Thin rice closed at 5 yuan 1 jiao. Early rice was 4 yuan 8 jiao, each down 5 jiao. However, because the price of silver dollars rose, combined with the price of bank drafts, it still saw an increase. The market quoted white rice and thin rice at 2.5 million, early rice at 2.3 million, each up 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible oil transactions were more than the previous day. Prices were quoted in both silver dollars and bank drafts. Soybean oil in silver dollars was 20 yuan, down 7 yuan. The bank draft prices were 20 million and 24 million yuan, showing an increase. Rapeseed oil was 16 yuan 5 jiao in silver dollars. Rapeseed oil's bank draft price was 20 million. Soybean cake was not quoted.</p>
<p>There were only actual sales transactions in flour. There was not much trading, because there were few buyers. The price was converted to silver dollars. Lao Che brand closed at 1 yuan 4 jiao, and Bingshun brand was 1 yuan 2 jiao, both down from the previous day's price. Bank draft transactions were not opened.</p>
<p>Trade in miscellaneous grains was as sluggish as ever. Those priced in silver dollars mostly declined. Mulberry field beans were 3 yuan 6 jiao. Selected green beans were 4 yuan 5 jiao. Corn and raw peanuts were rarely quoted. White hemp was quoted at 10 yuan, yellow hemp was 8 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
