<h3>上海保衛戰向高潮發展　浦東共軍傷亡慘重　正向陸行鎮上瞿家宅潰退</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部發佈戰況：（一）自上海保衛戰序幕揭開以來，昨為第七日，各綫均有接觸，以全般形勢觀察，戰事正向高潮方面發展，近幾日中，尤以月浦，楊行，劉行一綫，及浦東川沙方面最為激烈，匪雖調集精銳，向我各該地區猛犯，然而由於我守軍英勇無比，誓與陣地共存亡之決心堅守反擊，致匪終無法得逞。十七日晚至十八日晨，經澈夜激戰後，匪傷亡慘重。我楊行方面某部，於昨日傍午向當面之匪進擊，激戰三小時後，匪見來勢不佳，後撤三里，我軍完成殲匪任務後，仍回原陣地固守，故月浦，劉行方面日間戰事沉寂。（二）據俘匪供稱：匪某軍在月浦楊行等地區，自戰鬥開始迄今，傷亡慘重，殘部已失去戰鬥能力，現已改由後續部隊某部接替，準備捲土重來，我前綫土氣旺盛，正嚴陣以待，當予犯匪以嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛部發表十八日戰況：（一）匪一部，於昨（十七）日下午八時開始，又向我楊行陣地擾亂，另股散匪向我獅子林，月浦陣地竄犯，我軍為澈底肅清來犯之匪，步砲空協力阻擊，匪軍傷亡慘重，攻勢頓挫，直至拂曉時，全綫戰事轉寂。（二）犯匪附砲四門，向我西塘橋南宅之錢竄犯，經我某部派出強力部隊，向匪之兩翼夾擊，匪遺屍三十餘具，向小南翔潰退。（三）我某軍於本（十八）日晨五時，組織突擊隊，向莘莊之匪掃蕩，該匪聞風逃竄，我軍於七時安然返防。（四）浦東戰事業已展開，於昨（十七）日傍晚起至今（十八）晨止，匪分股進犯我金家橋，新陸鎮，薩家宅等前進陣地，守軍配合海空軍及砲兵，不斷予匪以猛烈轟擊，尤以砲兵威力直向匪增援隊作猛烈之轟擊，匪因傷亡過重，即向陸行鎮瞿家宅潰退，我軍正予追剿中。</p>
<h3>湯總司令發表談話　發揮偉大力量爭取最後勝利</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕記者昨房湯總司令於前綫，承認百忙中接見，并對記者談話稱：「淞滬保衛戰自十二日開始，迄今適為一週，共匪先後進犯月浦·楊行·七寶及浦東等地，戰況至為激烈，我軍憑藉士氣之旺盛及工事之堅固，處處予犯匪嚴重打擊，匪廿八，廿九兩軍業已潰不成軍，其新增之卅一，卅三及犯浦東之廿五，三〇等軍，亦已遭嚴重打擊，近日匪雖屢屢更調部隊，不斷進犯，但在我海陸空軍密切配合下，不斷予以重創，便其損失慘重，獲得初步之勝利。按此次保衛大上海戰爭，原為保衛上海市六百萬市民之自由，生命財產而戰，亦為保衛比全國唯一之經濟文化中樞而戰，在戰事逼近市郊之時，全市市民鎮定沉着，生活如常，并熱烈展開勞軍運動，是足見愛護自由為人人之基本要求，此實為可喜之現象。本人忝負守土保民之責，對上海市民生命財產之保衛，以及工厰裝置之維護，具有最大的之決心，對於市區之安寗秩序，必須盡全力以維持，如有不肖份子及匪諜陰謀之輩，造謠中傷，散佈流言，企圖分化我軍民情感及騷擾搶劫者，格殺勿論。當我海陸空軍將士及全體市民密切配合，一德一心，為自由而戰，相信必能發揮偉大之力量，爭取漆滬保衛戰之最後勝利，而上海郊外必為共匪之墳墓，定無疑義。」</p>
<h3>月浦楊行國軍　陣地固似磐石</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部十八日上午十一時發佈戰訊：（一）月浦，獅子林，楊行方面，匪軍攻勢連日迭遭頓挫，傷亡總數在兩軍人以上，但匪軍甚為頑強，不惜以人命為兒戲，於昨（十七）日晚八時起，再圖蠢犯，故昨日晚到本日拂曉，砲聲隆隆，不絶於耳，殺聲震天，慘絕人寰，經澈夜激戰後，我軍陣地仍固若磐石，且獲戰果甚豐。（二）小南翔東北地區，匪約三四百人，於昨日晚七時集中砲火，向該地竄擾，我守軍當即猛烈反擊，戰況發展到今晨一時，更形激烈，該地火光燭天，匪軍見我早有戒備，無隙可乘，攻勢即行停止，現雙方正對峙中。（三）昨（十七）日晚匪調動頻繁，集結於周浦鶴沙以南沈莊附近地區，判斷似有進攻三林塘模樣，我正嚴密戒備中。（四）昨（十七）日晚我連續出動機羣，對川沙周浦之犯匪猛烈轟炸，又我砲兵協同裝甲車，徐家路，曹家路，及新陸鎮匪犯澈夜砲擊，匪遺屍遍野，我軍正待機出擊。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防司衛令部十八日上午十一時發佈戰訊：（一）十七日晚八時起，匪傾全力以人海戰術向我楊行陣地反復猛撲，我守軍某部官兵奮勇反擊，同時我神鷹深夜向匪陣地投射照明彈，發現匪砲後陣地，我吳淞要塞砲當向匪猛烈轟炸，在空軍揭示目標下，匪砲兵陣地全部被我摧毀，戰況愈烈，士氣愈旺，至十八日晨，戰事漸趨沉寂，我陣地依然無恙。（二）匪殘部千餘人，於十七日拂曉竄入月浦鎮我軍陣地，我部奉命出擊，於九時將該地區之匪全部包圍，經三小時劇烈戰鬥，將匪全部殲滅，生俘二百餘名，鹵獲平射砲三門，輕重機槍廿餘挺，衝鋒槍步槍數百支，其他戰利品甚夥。（三）殘匪二千餘人，於十七日薄暮，向我劉家行李師陣地以人海戰術更番猛撲，我官兵沉着應戰，犯匪遭受重創，死傷甚重，我陣地屹立未動，十八日拂曉戰鬥仍在繼續中。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部十八日上午十一時發佈戰訊：浦東方面，昨下午五時起，匪以一個軍之兵力，向我某部正面猛衝，前後連續至八次以上，我軍步砲協同，對匪展開反擊，匪遺屍纍纍，多係臨時被裹脅來充當肉彈之無辜青年壯丁。另竄入東溝之鐵郎中橋鎮之匪兩個團，刻正被我某部包圍痛擊，詳細戰果正清查中。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：十七日夜十一時以後，獅子林，月浦，楊行，劉行等地匪全面向我連續作波浪式衝鋒，均不得逞，頃據前方報告，匪傷亡之重，為淞滬保衛戰展開後一週來所僅見。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部發佈戰訊：（一）匪三千餘，於十七日晚九時許，向新陸仁橋及張江柵等處竄擾，經我守軍分頭堵擊，匪數次企圖突破我軍陣地，均未得逞，我忠勇官兵愈戰愈勇，予匪以迎頭痛擊，是役斃傷匪千餘人，生俘百餘，鹵獲戰利品無算，詳細戰果在清查中。（二）竄周浦之匪先頭二千餘人，於十七日晚在北蔡東三林塘等處，與我守軍發生激戰，經我步砲協同，予匪以猛烈打擊，匪傷亡慘重，勢難再犯。（三）竄犯月浦·楊行·劉行之匪，於十七日七時許，與我冠軍發生激戰，經我陸海空砲聯合向匪猛烈轟擊，當將匪砲兵陣地完全摧毀，迄昨晨三時，匪勢稍殺，我軍士氣大振，卽乘勝出擊，痛殲頑匪，是役斃傷匪二千餘人，生俘四百餘，詳細戰果仍在清查中。</p>
<h3>桂總司令率艦隊　砲轟浦東區共軍</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕海軍總司令桂永清將軍，連日督令海軍第×艦隊艦艇多艘，在吳淞口外配合陸空軍，砲擊月浦·楊行一帶進犯上海西北防綫匪軍，收穫戰果甚大，現以匪軍復向浦東方面蠢動，除飭第×艦隊馬司令紀壯指揮所屬英勇出擊外，昨（十八）晨復親乘府艦出巡浦東區吳淞區一帶水面，以熾烈砲火，痛殲進犯之匪軍，斃傷達數千人。據桂總司令談：本軍協同陸軍作戰，決以全力堅守大上海，予匪軍以嚴重打擊，過去三年來，海軍在長江區域作戰，雖因江面狹小，腹背易受威脅，未能充分發揮戰鬥力量，但賴官兵用命，仍能達成預定任務，收穫極大戰果，例如海軍艦艇配合陸軍吳仲堅部堅守安慶，為時甚久，殲匪數萬，使匪不取正視，若非整個戰局發生變化，安慶決非匪能進佔。目下上海保衛戰，海軍活動範圍即廣，復有堅強之陸空軍配合，相信必能堅守無虞。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕湯總司令恩伯以海軍第×艦隊所屬艦艇，對保衛大上海戰爭，立功甚偉，尤以粉碎匪軍突破突破月浦楊行防綫進佔吳淞區之企圖，對於穩定戰局，建功甚偉，除親赴馬司令旗艦而致嘉勉外，并將發犒賞銀元二萬元，以慰勞該艦全體忠勇官兵云。</p>
<h3>江南義勇總隊　協助國軍作戰</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕本月十六日，閔行附近三林塘一帶之共匪，企圖配合包圍大上海之總攻戰，向三林塘周邊不時偷襲，該地原駐有青年救國團江南義勇第三總隊第七支隊第一大隊，該大隊長曹英武，即率領全體官兵四百餘人，奮勇出擊，經日夜之搏戰，予共匪嚴重打擊，終予潰逃，該大隊少數官兵亦壯烈犧牲。惟查該義勇總隊本為民眾武力，全係愛國熱血青年所組成，彈藥給養均係自籌，經不斷與匪戰鬥後，彈儘糧絕，該隊業經電本市國防部民眾武力督導處，設法迅予補給，俾得繼續殺敵，加強大上海保衛之防綫，而發揮熱血青年之救國革命精神。聞本市督導處立將該大隊戰鬥經過專案呈報湯總司令，請迅予補給該大隊糧彈外，懇對督導處所屬各總隊惠予普遍發給糧彈，以俾各駐節郊外之義勇救國戰士，得以為國效命也。</p>
<h3>上海電台改訂　報告戰訊時間</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕上海電台報告戰訊，原定自昨日起，每日上午十二時，下午十一時分二次廣播。茲因傳遞需要，未能及時，特自今日起廣播時改為下午十二時四十五分至一時，及晚上十二時至十二時一刻，每日報告兩次，業於昨晚起按時開始，全市電台并一律轉播。</p>
<h3>空軍廣泛炸射　獲得豐碩戰果</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕上海保衛戰十八日已為第七日，共軍雖不顧死傷，仍集中攻擊吳淞要塞區，顯然已發現在此處攻堅不易，故而在浦東亦集結兵力，企逼近上海市外灘區之對江東岸地帶，以圖側面威脅上海市區，我軍早已計及共軍必走此途，故亦早在浦東區預佈陣地，十八日整日吳淞要塞區及浦東區兩處同時激戰，空軍亦集重兵於吳淞區及浦東區兩綫上空，炸射共軍，并廣泛炸射大上海保衛圈外圍共軍補給綫，所獲戰果如次：（一）炸毀月浦西北共軍砲陣四處，劉行北范家橋等地砲陣三處，劉行北范家橋等地砲陣三處，羅店至月浦小河內木船二十隻，瀏河到羅店木船三十只，斃傷月浦南顧家宅及楊行西北八字橋兩處工事內共軍一千餘名。（二）斃傷浦東周浦鎮內共軍二百名，楊家宅共軍百名，南匯坦直橋共軍二百名，協助陸軍部隊攻克德士古油庫東南小河口東岸小梁山，炸毀該處共軍陣地二處，炸毀周浦鎮林墉西南周家宅河口木船三十隻，張家路海邊木船十隻，炸毀龍華機場對岸浦江小河口擬偷渡之共軍木船三十隻。（三）協助南翔附近陸軍部隊在陸家宅對共軍作戰，炸毀該處共軍工事二處，斃傷共軍百餘名。（四）炸毀石湖蕩河內汽艇一艘，拖船五隻，斃傷共軍六百名。（五）發現蘇州到崑山共軍火車五節，炸毀其二節。</p>
<h3>立院諮文政院　支持政府作戰</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十八日電〕立法院各立委鍳於中共迷信武力，不顧信義，於和談期中竟提出其所謂八條二十四款之「國內和平協定」，限期接受，并悍然大舉南犯，擴大戰禍，屠殺人民，此種破壞和平之責任，當由中共負擔，爰於十九次會議通過「支持政府對中共繼續作戰之決議」，昨日特諮請行政院查照，茲錄諮文及決議案於后：諮文：本院三會期第十九次會議，經通過「為中共破壞和平，支持政府對中共繼續作戰之決議」紀錄在卷，相應抄附「為中共破壞和平，支持政府對中共繼續作戰之決議」一份，諮請查照為荷。自本年元旦以來，政府順從民意，倡導和平，極儘委曲容忍能事，誠意期望獲得公平合理全面永久之和平，本院在京開會，會經決議對政府謀和政策一致予以支持，并對中共呼籲停戰，不意和談期中，中共竟提出其所謂八條廿四款之國內和平協定，限期接受，隨即發動攻勢，渡江南犯，擴大戰禍，屠殺人民，此種破壞和平之責任，當由中共負擔，事實俱在，自為全國人民所共見。基於過去經驗，本院同人深切瞭解中共之企圖，在顛覆國家，奴役人民，申言之（一）中共所發動之戰爭，乃具有國際性之侵略戰爭，而非單純之國內戰爭。（二）中共乃與愛好自由之全體人民作戰，此一戰爭，非黨派之戰爭，而非善良人民對搞暴力之戰爭。（三）中共以暴力奪取政權，其目的在摧毀民主，實行極權政治。（四）在中共統制之下，不僅人民之生命財產毫無保障，且拆散家庭，迷亂倫理，人民絕無自由生活之可能，我全國人民為爭生存，爭自由，人類正義，為保衛家園，維護國家獨立，當一致奮起，支持政府，團結反共陣容，作戰到底，直至中共放棄其武力征服之迷夢，達到最後勝利而後已。</p>
<h3>滬市民踴躍發動　慰勞傷患工作　谷正綱雷震等赴浦東前綫勞軍</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕本市平凉路第十九區菜場攤販同仁互助會，前任理事長沈長生及現任理事長張阿二，總務主任姚懷安等，憤於共匪叛亂行為，激於懮國熱忱，為配合大上海保衛戰自動發動該會會員從事慰勞傷患工作，前在平涼路第六十五醫院第二組自動購買白佈數十疋，為該組在前方作戰受傷官兵裏傷，并將病房佈置煥然一新，且連日購備上熟白米煮粥供應傷患，對於較重傷患官兵，不有食粥者則煮送桂圓甘湯，親自發動人員撫侍，此外并贈大批香煙，餅乾，麵包，糖果等物，并自十七日起組織服務隊，為傷患寫信洗補衣服等勞苦工作，該組傷患同志以該會理事長及總務主任各會員如此熱忱，莫不感激流涕，均誓願於身體健康恢復後，重赴前綫，殲滅敵匪，完成保衛大上海任務，以報答該會父老兄弟云。</p>
<p>又京滬杭警備司令鍳於沈張二理事長及姚主任各會員等之愛國熱忱，已予嘉勉，以示鼓勵。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕本市平涼路第六十五傷兵醫院第二組，十五日晚收容輕重傷兵二百餘名，因一時尋覓病房不易，乃假平涼路小菜場二層菜場作臨時病室，施行急救，十六日晨市民到菜場買菜時，發現為保衛上海作戰而負傷之英勇將士呻吟，紛紛圍觀，慰問者達數千人，均深受感動，贈送各種慰勞物品·餅乾·堆積如山，尚有捐助袁頭者，十六日午因傷重死亡五名，市民自動携香燭錫箔焚燒者不知凡幾，是日下午三時，普善山莊前往收殮時，尚有數市民尾隨哭送，由此可見上海市民崇敬勇將情緒一斑。</p>

<h3>社論　銀元價格今天掛牌了！</h3>
<p>醞釀已久的開掛銀元牌價問題，中央銀行昨已決定自今日起，正式開掛銀元牌價；并決定三項辦法：（一）自今日起開始銀元掛牌；（二）自今日起中央銀行對各行莊隔夜存款之餘額，恢復搭發銀元；（三）各行莊自今日起，應儘其所存有之銀元，儘量搭發顧客。至於銀元牌價及中央銀行搭發各行莊銀元之成數，則須於今日下午決定。</p>
<p>關於這個問題，中央銀行金銀一準委員會原定於本月十六日起即實行，但後來深怕刺激物價并沒有見諸事實；據聞當局鍳於牌價高低問題，直接影響市場的安定，故有待考慮的必要。但另據本市總工會方面表示，認為銀元價格如不早日掛牌，則銀元黑市價與官價距離更遠，各厰月半發新，勞資糾紛迭起，無法取得協調，故已推派代表籲請補救。本來銀元價格用硬性規定，殊失事理之平，當前銀元掛牌如不早日實現，本市的經濟金融，殊難納入正常的軌道。</p>
<p>銀元與金圓劵的比價，自從當局硬性規定了一比四百萬之後，銀元價格似乎比較趨於穩定，一般物價似乎也連帶的穩定下去；但這究竟是表面的觀察，如果我們仔細的分析一下，就知道這種想法完全是不夠透澈了。</p>
<p>第一，銀元限價的要件，是各種銀元不分版式，一律通用，在這種情形之下，就難逃葛雷欣支則的「惡幣驅逐良幣」的現象，所以近日來市場上充滿了鷹·龍洋和雜洋的交易，而大·小頭便隨之而絕跡。</p>
<p>第二，限價前鷹·龍洋及雜洋的市場價格，大都在三百萬元左右，自從規定了銀元一比四百萬的比率後，無形中大·小頭的價格，更加提高，　然亦有按照法定價格出售的，但那不過是中下家庭，薪水階級們為了應付柴·米·油·鹽的支出，而忍痛殺「頭」而已。</p>
<p>第三，近來部份物價穩定或跌落的現象，有人歸功於銀元的限價，其實這種說法，是極為勉強的，因為當有物價的穩定或下跌，并非指全部物價而言，實係限於一部份的奢侈品及非必需品，而這許多物品，穩定或降落，乃由於銷路阻滯，購買力薄弱，及工商業周轉不靈所致，并非銀元本身有此魔力；反之，民生必需的米糧，菜蔬等，無一不漲起數倍，由此即可以說明物價的漲落，完全由於環境及供求關係使然了。</p>
<p>從上列幾點事實看來，可知硬性　銀元限價，對於抑平物價本身，并無多大的帮助，況且銀元價格老是死釘在四百萬元的比率上，不但失去了銀元正常的交易，而且由於他處銀元價格高於本市，也使本市銀元價格一項脫節的現象，如前幾天福州大頭官價，尚祇有四百萬元，彼此之間相距如此之大，怎不逼使大頭外流？</p>
<p>現在我們所以主經銀元掛牌的理由，不僅在於各地銀元價格　　節，事實上目前銀元雖不是法定的通貨，但它已具備了貨幣　形態，及貨幣　　　性能，所以在社會上的地位，已不能等閒視之，又因為它比金圓劵有實值，比商品更為活潑，隨時可折成貨幣或貨物，因而其價格方面自然是較為堅定，這種現象，尤其在作為投機籌碼的「大頭」更是頭角崢嶸，在現勢下實無抑低的理由。故我們以為當局對於銀元價格的規定，不可過於刻板，更不可過份的偏低，目前仍在混亂時期之中，限價要辦得好，絕對不是一件容易的事情，假使反其道而行之，一切因勢利導，自易收到較為具體的效果。</p>
<p>銀元限價的流弊，最顯著的一點，即是中央銀行沒有官價收入的銀元，而在搭發工商業及普通行莊款項中的銀元，盡是以官定比率作價的，這种損失，雖是中央銀行的損失，但實際也就是國庫的損失。再主工商業浮報工人，虛領「配給」銀元的事情。并不是絕對沒有，而一般行莊在領到「配給」銀元之後，不肯按官價「配給」與顧客的事實，則更是耳熟能詳，所以釘牢官價，祗是造成少數人特殊利益的機會罷了。時到今日，國家還要蒙受這種不必要的損失，我們真要代為叫屈。</p>
<p>經濟現象，顯然有別於政治和軍事的現象，一切事實，必須合乎自然發展的均衡狀態，如果要打破這種均衡的局面，便形成了畸形的發展，而不適於經濟的原則，我們對於銀元的價格所持的態度，正可以此說明。現階段中，欲求銀元價格　合乎自然水準，只有放棄限價政策，一方面成立銀元公開市場，一方面由中央銀行金銀一平準委員會參酌市場實際情形，逐日調整各版式銀元的牌價，才能打開銀元價格問題的僵局，至於如何防制銀元價格的過份僵高，那要看中央銀行掌握銀元掌握銀元的實力如何而定了；但，無論如何，中央銀行毅然決定自今天起開始掛牌，終不失為一種賢明的措置。</p>
<h3>月浦的前綫行</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　式之</p>
<p>〔本報十八日訊〕在晨光。曦微中，我與本報攝影記者陸順興兄駕着吉普，吉普向江（灣）吳（淞）及吳月（浦）道上邁進，作上海保衛戰發生以來第一次戰地訪問。就途程言，往返合計，雖尚不足百公里，但此行所遭遇的艱苦，尤其是驚險的場面，要為我十二年戰地記者生活中所未聞未見。而前綫戰士的艱苦，及士氣的昂揚，同樣地，也是我十二年戰地記者生活中所未聞未見。這關係着上海六百萬市民安危的問題，今天已可從這篇短稿中獲得答案，而誠如陸順興兄說：「這簡直是奇蹟。」</p>
<p>在江灣革地，我們先通過了陳炳寰處長與某某軍劉玉章軍長通了電話，他允許我們到他的指揮所，作一簡短晤談，我們就由王科長述彭陪同，在十時許到了吳淞某地作的指揮所。我和劉軍長已有五六年未見面，這次我只覺得他比以前瘦得多，由於六晝六夜因指揮戰事未嘗一睡，及無時不在抱着電話機的緣故，嗓音顯然已經嘶啞，但有一點是我無可置疑的，就是他的精神始終很飽滿，充溢着無限活力和戰力，這種活力和戰力，也是象徵着他的堅強和戰鬥精神和戰鬥意志。</p>
<p>劉軍長這個軍，他的第一二任軍長是關麟徵和張耀明，它在抗戰期間已經寫下了不知多少可歌可泣的史詩，它剋敵制勝的唯一要訣，也就是當初關麟徵將軍所倡導的作戰三要訣：「穩！—忍！—根！」該部隊直到現在，仍保持住這優良傳統。劉將軍雖於去歲四月才繼覃異之將軍後，出任軍長，但在去年七月至年底，在東北的「三戰三捷」，克復遼陽，攻打鞍山，收復營口，澈底殲滅林彪遼南鐵軍第九縱隊——使敵軍聞之喪胆。而劉部南調後，在上海保衛戰中，遂無考慮地被湯恩伯總司令倚作「上海新長城」，安排在最為吃重，由吳淞，獅子林，經月浦，楊林至劉行之綫。劉將軍亦不負湯老總付託之重，已「小試牛刀，」在一週來滬戰序幕戰中，擊潰了共軍兩個軍。</p>
<p>我們和劉軍長之間的談話很簡，由於他馬上還要親赴前綫指揮作戰，我除了向他致敬，并叩詢了張耀明司令官的住地外，就只是順興兄的攝影。接着，他介紹候程達參謀長相見，要他告訴我關於當前的戰況。</p>
<p>候參謀長也是抗戰期間的老友，多年未晤，一旦見面，自然也別有一番親切，而令人感到友情的可愛與溫暖。他雖然也同樣忙，同樣地六晝夜未獲安眠，但他仍不厌求詳地告訴我過去六晝夜的戰況。</p>
<p>候參謀長首先告訴我，這次該軍打了個大胜仗，事實俱在，無須強調：「陳毅的第廿八第廿九兩個軍，已被我斃傷五分之四，合約三萬餘人，尤其是素以攻堅聞名的陳毅部第廿八軍，他原來的番號是第九縱隊，過去在山東，下濰縣，佔兗州，攻濟南，皆是該縱隊是主要力量。」因為我過去在山東住得很久，對於陳毅部隊的素質了解較多，當然，我對於候參謀長所言，自然毫無疑問。</p>
<p>候參謀長繼謂：陳毅的企圖，原來是命廿八，廿九兩軍於十二日夜開始攻擊，并限令該兩軍於十五日前突破獅子林，月浦，楊行，劉行國軍之陣地，進佔吳淞，封鎖黃浦江，遮斷上海國軍上之水連絡，然後製壓并包圍上海國軍，以遂行為北平式的「局部和平」的故技，初未料在十二日夜，以一個營用滲透戰術進入月浦鎮市街後，我在各碉堡內守軍，竟毫未為動，待天明後，即會同援軍，在劉軍長親臨新鎮第一綫指揮下，予以全部殲滅。十四日至十五日，連續三日，共　不分　　，北起獅子林，經月浦，楊行，劉行，全綫猛犯，國軍為爭取主動，亦予還擊，故該戰事以該三日為最　烈，共軍亦以該三日犧牲為最重。至十六日，陳毅廿八，廿九兩軍不僅未完成其突破國軍之陣地佔領吳淞之原任務，且傷亡各達全軍五分之四，致被迫不得不予十六日上半夜利用大雨，西撤第二綫整補，而改以卅一，卅三兩軍接防。該兩軍因鍳於前次之失，乃改以夜間主動向我全綫進攻，而我在夜間則僅局部出擊，而以白晝在海空協同下，向敵攻擊，故截至十八日午，共軍初未佔得一點便宜，而卅一，卅二兩軍所表現的戰鬥力，顯較廿八，廿九兩軍，尤其廿八軍脆弱多多。</p>
<p>侯參謀長報告了六天來的戰況後，最後告訴我國軍制勝之由：（一）士氣昂揚，（二）準備充分，（三）命令貫徹，（四）海陸空協同一致，（五）指揮靈活。共軍此次失敗的原因：（一）抄襲過去，滿擬以精銳之師，企圖突破一點，直下吳淞，困住上海，因此犯了輕兵急進，致易被我各個殲滅。（二）彼係「長攻」，我係「短打」，所謂「短打」，一是「火力短」（在短距離內殲滅敵人），二為「時間短」，（在很短時間內，一鼓而將敵殲滅之），此二者既皆可節省彈藥，并可包殲敵人。（三）共軍所使用的「人海戰術」，又可名之「趕鴨戰術」，將鴨子一批，趕上火綫，死了一批，再來一批，好在「不是自己兒子」，實在太違背人道，但這種「趕鴨戰術」遇到了國軍周密堅強的「梅花陣」，神出鬼沒的「長勝軍」，也就正如耗子鑽鐵籠，「只進不出了」。</p>

<h3>英國務大臣麥克尼爾宣布　不承認弗良哥政府　對西班牙政策一貫不變　美進出口銀行暫時不考慮對西貸款</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦十八日電〕聯合國大會前日於舉行全體大會時表決南美洲國家所提促各國重派大使及全權公使駐節馬行里案，當時英美法等十六國棄權，二十六國贊同該案，而投反對票者十五國，該案乃因不能獲得必要之三分之二多數，而未通過。英國代表國務大臣麥克尼爾闡明英國態度時稱，貢對西政策仍一貫不變，英政府曾信一九四六年十二月聯合國大會撤退駐馬德里外交使節之決議將不能有效，而該預信已證明不謬，然英國政府已遵照該決議，撤退馬德里大使，英國因欲避免誤解為同意弗朗哥及其政府之行為，故不能支持南美洲國家之提案。麥克尼爾又稱，無論英國政府與人民，均不能同意弗朗哥及其極權政府中之黨徒；亦不能同意禁止集會，統制言論，不作公正審判及禁止批評等種種行為。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十七日電〕消息靈通人士稱：伸出口銀行今日已拒絕馬德里美西銀行總裁摩雷尼陽近要求貸款十二億美元予西班牙之請。進出口銀行某高級職員告摩雷尼謂，由於種種困難，故進出口銀行不得不暫停考慮此問題。</p>
<h3>貝文與史福薩聯合計劃　聯大會予以否決　前義屬殖民地問題更趨復雜</h3>
<p>〔合眾社富勒興十八日電〕聯合國大會十八日晨否決處理前義屬非洲殖民地的貝文·史福薩聯合計劃。由於聯大未能在夜會中結束其事務，大會在上午二時三十二分休會，并預定在下午三時（上海時間十九日上午四時）舉行最後例外會議，再圖解決此一復雜問題。</p>
<p>貝文·史福薩計劃的失敗，使西方國家認為目前可能解決前義屬殖民地問題的希望，幻為泡影。西文國家企圖藉該項計劃保持其在非洲重要戰略地區的基地的希望，亦告湮沒，最後之表決為十四票對三十七票，七票棄權，但此項失敗并決定性者，該項計劃失敗的徵兆，在處理西利比亞的主要條款未能獲得三分之二的必要多數，該款給予義大利以西利比亞的託管權，自一九五一年開始，至一九五六年全部利比亞（包括西利比亞·昔蘭尼加·及腓仁）獲得獨立時為止，表決時三十三票贊成，十七票反對，八票棄權，此一條款失敗後，擁護義大利託管該區的二十個拉丁美洲國家集團中的十九國，卽執行渠等阻遏全部計劃的恫言，法國亦參加此一集團。此一結果乃使英國託管昔蘭尼加及法國託管腓仁以及將以里特里亞（西部除外）併入阿比西尼亞的條款告吹，因此等條款均須在逐章表決中獲得三分之二的多數。關於義大利託管索馬里蘭的建議，亦未能獲得三分之二的多數。西利比亞主要條款的失敗，係由於阿拉伯·亞洲·及蘇聯集團的反對。同時，大會以絕對多數擊敗蘇聯的由聯合國聯合託管三非洲殖民地，而使利比亞及以里特利亞在五年內獨立用索馬里十年內獨立的建議。大會并否決伊拉克的建議，該項建議主張由聯合國聯合託管利比亞及索馬里蘭，而將以里特里亞分劃與阿比西尼亞及沙特·阿拉伯。</p>

<h3>潘迪特夫人　在美重申印政策</h3>
<p>對強權集團絕不參與</p>

<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十七日電〕不久將來之事態，將決定印度尼西亞與東南亞洲在美國遠東政策之紀錄中，是否為得抑為失，其原因厥為以下三項發展：（一）荷蘭與印尼共和國及印尼聯邦將在海牙舉行會議；（二）中國共黨續有進展及其對海外華僑之影響；（三）美國希望支援真正而非共產黨指導之國民主義運動。與海牙會議有關之另一問題，為印尼共和國政治領袖同意於政府遷返日惹時，頒發停戰令，屆時印尼共和國陸軍是否服從此停戰領？與中國問題關聯者，與國民主義有關者，則為若干人士相信區域性協定不足以解決太平洋問題，但無共產黨參加之國民主義運動足以解決之。觀察家認為印尼共和國總統蘇卡諾及總理哈泰若仍握有充分力量，使軍隊能服從停戰，則海牙會議有獲得成功之良好機會。若果如此，而印尼恢復和平，且有荷美兩國予印尼國民主義以援助，使共產黨不能奪獲印尼領導權，則東印度或將成為東南亞洲方面不屬於共產黨之堡壘。暹羅與馬來，華僑極多，東南亞洲其他各國華僑亦不少。英方曾謂馬來境內之叛動，完全為華僑共黨份子率領。此間觀察又信法國支援之安南遜王保大，在越南獲得人民擁護之機會，并不較共黨領袖胡志明為佳。聞美國方面現信東南亞洲各國對於他國之問題，極不關心，故不能實行區域聯盟，眾信印尼愛共產黨之影響最少，故美國對印尼所抱希望最高</p>

<h3>克萊自德返抵華府</h3>
<p>深受官方盛大歡迎，并接受橡葉勳章。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十七日電〕克萊將軍於一生為國服務卓著勛績後，頃已返國退休，渠受到一個英雄的歡迎。克萊係自德國返美。彼任德境美軍長官四年，甫於五月十五日卸職，官方立卽準備予以歡迎并舉行儀式。</p>
<p>此一四星上將自一九一八年前任軍職，於第二次大戰時負責美陸軍供應計劃。渠在德國最傑出之成就厥為創始空軍偉業。在蘇聯實施陸上封鎖，截斷正常陸上供應路綫後，柏林憑籍空運，獲得糧食，燃料，藥品及其他重要必需品至三百廿八日之久。克來常圖擺脫現職，以便息隱，但因政府以其職位重要，未允所請，直至最近始準其辭職。克萊在記者招待會告發問者稱：茍蘇聯再度實施柏林封鎖，則渠將大感驚詫，蓋蘇聯不能不顧及因此所引起之全世界不利的反響也。美國表明其意向，「繼續吾人合作，支持柏林空運，支持歐洲復興，并支援西歐安全公約，此等行動已獲得西歐信任。二年前之緊張狀態今日已不復存在」。克萊將此點歸功於人民對美國愿意支援西方國家復原一事之態度。克萊表示信念：「吾人如在目前或不久之將來撤退吾人之佔領軍，實為不智之舉」。渠力言：佔領軍之撤退必須在歐洲局勢穩定以後方可實行。某一記者請求詳論最近完成之東德投票事，該處一千三百名以上之投票人對於蘇聯所圈定之候選人名單，均投反對票。克萊評稱：「此種投票表示任何極權國家中一種大有勇氣之行動」。關於外傳東德與西德政治家之會議，克萊承認此種會議已舉行數次。渠重述共黨控制之東德人士意圖誘勸西德人士拒絕設立西德政府之建議。但渠又稱：東德人士之失敗顯然由於議會理事所取之行動，該理事會對於西德，投票決定一種完全民主政府程序。當克萊抵達國民機塲由飛機中步下時，由軍人，航空員，水手及海員等組成之儀仗隊全體立正，并鳴炮示敬。國防部長約翰遜趨前與克萊握手歡迎，并表示美國人民對於「一種優良工作成績」之感激。在機塲歡迎之人員，除約翰遜外，尚有全國軍事組織之高級官員。數千私人公民亦熱烈歡迎克萊返國。克萊將軍及其夫人自飛機塲馳赴白宮，當卽由總統與杜魯門夫人予以歡迎。在白宮花園中，杜魯門以勳章贈予五十二歲西點大學出身之將軍，以示對渠「為國家人類出眾服務」之一種激賞，當時閣員國會領袖，軍事顯要與英法大使均在塲贈與克萊之出眾服務章為橡勳章。克萊獲得此種勳章已屬第三次。授勳之文告有言謂「已往，渠在協助武裝吾國軍隊方面曾有出眾成就，其後復因渠應付德國軍政府方面之困難工作而在其已往之成就上加上新的與不可磨滅之功績……德國方面之情形使渠之服務為不可缺少者，直至本年五月十五日始得準其退貨，良以在西德之憲法擬就後，渠之工作已達到一里程碑。渠之任務異常復雜與困難，而此項任務之完成乃國人將永遠引以自傲者。」克萊繼自白宮前往國會大廈，而獲有向參眾兩院發表演說之殊榮。　　旁聽走廊內坐無虛隙。此一退休軍事長官步經眾院之長中央通廊，趲講臺前，群眾起立歡呼，克萊作臨時演說。渠告各眾議員稱：德國人民已「堅決致力」種政府之建立，此種政府維持人類個人之尊嚴」。克萊謂四強管制德國之失敗乃「由於吾人發現四國中之一國具有雙重目的」。渠并不隱瞞其所指者卽係蘇聯。據謂二項目的為：（一）取得最大額之賠償；（二）成立一獨被警察國家所控制或至少剝削之政府。在向參議院演說時，克萊指斥蘇聯曾圖阻撓歐復興并封鎖柏林。并稱，此乃由於蘇聯恐懼美國關於鞏固歐洲自由國家之計劃所致。據云：西歐對蘇聯可能侵略之恐懼心理，已由北大西洋公約之締結而告消散。西文國家兩年來圖與蘇聯合作，成立一全德之民主政府。但「吾人并未獲致共同立塲。吾人之目的未能實現，但在此敗挫中或竟造成吾人最大之勝利。吾人發現自由國家必須獲得支持，以防阻威脅民主生活方式之勢力侵襲」美國展開歐洲復興計劃之時，卽係達到高潮。大西洋公約之簽訂消弭西歐之對於侵略的恐懼心理。克蘋將於十九日前往紐約，接受官方歡迎。然後擬遄返其故居喬治亞州瑪麗他鎭。胡伯納中將繼克萊職，任德境美軍總司令。并將担任美軍事長官，直至美國根據三國對西德協定，指派一文職高級專員為止。</p>
<h3>三強足球賽第二幕　東青今日大戰　下進四時半在逸園開始</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三強足球邀請賽今日第二幕，東青二軍，會師逸園，下午四時半展幕。東華久未露臉，球迷渴念不已，此次青山再起，除原有老將外，加入大批重力軍，尤以鐵閘吳祺祥坐鎭中堅，謝錫川助防後衛，將為青白前鋒之重大阻礙，能否越此關險，胥看青白前鋒諸將顏色。前鋒加入大將高秀清，東華如虎添翼。青白則後衛大交嚴士鑫決定出馬，更使青白陣容，完整無缺。今日東青大戰，無疑將本季難能可貴之精彩一戰。裁判員方榮富，巡邊員陳福寶徐國樑，門票價格，為求普及，分二百四十萬元一百六十萬元兩種，為求維持秩序，僅售一萬張，逸園今日上午十時卽開始發售，以防擁擠。四維童子軍將到塲協助軍警維持秩序。兩隊秩序列下：</p>

<p>青白日前首仗對鐵路，於一種頹勢之下，卒能以三比三逼和對手，足證其經驗豐富，臨陣不亂，盟主風度不凡。防禦方面除黃士傑·姜聞清·孟義良·伏乃堂外，世運代表嚴士鑫重披征衣，出任左衛，益見天衣無縫，安如泰山。羅壽福·金祿生·顧以撒·劉隆馨·劉體寅五虎，沖鋒陷陣，銳利無匹，加以自港歸來之費春華助戰，更覺錦上添花。</p>
<p>東華息影已久，此次由賈幼良召集舊部，重整旗鼓，并經二週來之勤加操練，已恢復昔日叱咤風云之姿態，門將國腳張邦綸，毋庸介紹，大刀張林根，坐鎭後方，再加謝錫川輔助，自更得力。中衛綫上韓尼波於洽興外，吳祺祥重返母隊效勞，主持中堅，形成最堅強陣營，進可攻退可守，無懈可擊。鋒綫韓龍海·陳明哲·李壵·賈幼良，搭擋有年，合作默契，今日復得高秀清參戰，更見完整無缺。東華全部精銳齊出，有與青白決一雌雄，兩雄會仗，戰情如火如荼，可以預期。</p>

<h3>總工會代表再請願　請即核定銀元牌價</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕市總工會鑒於指數計薪辦法取銷，改用銀元計薪辦法後，五月上期工資，因國行銀元價格迄未核定，而黑市銀元價格狂漲，致勞資雙方，無法依循，糾紛迭起，影響社會治安甚大，日前經該會第九次理監事會議議決，推定常務理監事方如升，孫鏡湖等五人，散會後卽赴局面陳局長設法補救，尚無結果。而各廠因發薪促起之糾紛，竟紛至沓來。昨（十八）日該會又推方如升，葉翔皋等資文再謁陳局長保泰，要求迅卽轉請國行，核定銀元牌價，以憑發放工資，否則應請資方依照辦法第三款規定，逕發銀元，以泯糾紛云。</p>

<h3>上海風氣大變　市民自動節約　貴菜蔬綢緞呢絨問津者絕少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自大上海保衛戰在四郊壯烈展開以來，本市市區內之社會秩序反日見紀律化，往免彌漫於各處之傳奇式生活已完全絕跡，投機市塲空前冷落，物價相當穩定，西區廣宅巨第整日重門深鎖。午前寫字間區電話及車輛擁塞情形已大為改善，各校大公司商號玻璃櫥窗外均加製護窗木板，普通居戶亦正在圍墻上及里弄口趕裝柵欄或鐵刺蒺藜。入晚九時左右街頭行人卽紛紛趕回家去，游宴娛樂塲所揮金如土之豪客已絕無僅有，一片戰時景象下，百餘年來奢　淫佚之海派風氣，顯已告別十里洋塲。</p>
<p>就一般市民日常生活而言，目前大多數家庭已自動養成節儉習慣。據記者數日來自各小菜塲上調查所得，最近魚肉海味之類及較高貴菜蔬消費量顯著減少，而鹹菜鹹魚豆腐等銷路極好。　集霞飛路中段之大批時裝店如金蘭·康樂·亞美·綠霞·福興·國華等，幾全部將大櫥窗拆卸，店員力竭聲嘶，立櫥基上高喊綢緞呢絨一律三折賤賣，宛似石路上之拍賣舊依，其價廉或猶且過之，但問津者絕少。大部市民現對衣着確已不感興趣，夏季應時之白皮靯，皮包及其他裝飾品，今年銷路卽慘淡不堪。西服業中大多數在近兩三週來未見有一顧客登門。</p>
<p>影院賣座慘淡　話劇料將崛起</p>
<p>電暖業方面現亦陷入空前不景氣狀態，因賣座黯淡，西片市場目前僅以存底拷貝週轉，如出水芙蓉，神槍手等舊仍經常在首輪戲院開映。國產製片商則因各廠負責人多離滬飛港，故停工之局已成。新片已無法開拍，大批「明星」如石　·張伐等已另組劇團在蘭心劇院演出話劇，預料今後一段時期內，話劇在本市又將風起雲涌。</p>
<p>至於平劇演出亦已無復往日之絢爛，大批紅角久未露面，各戲院均以半價竭力號召觀眾，惟每晚八時卽停羅閉幕，令人頗感索然。以串演滑稽相聲聞名之程笑飛·程筱亭等，近亦因堂會激減，收入大不如前，已聯合組設委託商店之類，在電台接受商號及用戶對商品買賣之介紹，渠等卽賴抽取佣金生活云。</p>

<h3>「難民」在香港　達到飽和點！</h3>
<p>— 靑雲</p>
<p>祖國的漫天烽火，香港已變成富貴人家的聖地，記得十二年前，中國抗戰初期情景，和現在實在沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>迨至南京棄守，推向上海，保衛戰快將展開的當兒，上海富有的人們，都拼命逃亡，不惜蒙上了一個「難民」的怪難聽的名詞，他們的目的地，也就是戰前曾一度被人認為世外桃源的香港元。隆隆機聲，蓋着整個小島上空，民航機在天空交織的飛着，並沒有片刻停止，使整個香港的三百多萬居民，神經上得不到寗靜，由淩晨破曉直至深夜，再轉到另一個淸晨，這聲音都沒有間斷過，昔日覺得冷落蕭條的啓德機塲，今天都變成了鬧市。</p>
<p>但，難民雖然滾滾而來，可是看不見有半點寒酸氣，他（她）們都穿上最時髦，最講究的時裝，更配帶上珍貴的珠寶首飾，堆得像小坵般的行李，而且，起帶着滿臉笑容，富足營養的面色，假如你說他們是「難民」，有些不大切合。</p>
<p>已經達到飽和點的香港人口，再加上如許「高等難民」，住的問題就更難解決了。假如你沒有一個相熟的朋友，那你休想在旅館找得一個房間。正因為要解決這個問題，市區內部，都在大興土木，工程完成之速，恐怕是香港有史以來所僅見。</p>
<p>「難民」來了以後所獲得的反應，首先就是糧食高漲，更加上靑黃不接，內地來港米糧減少，也就更促成米價的上漲。雪米升到五十四五元，其他柴炭啦，食油啦，蔬菜啦，也都在陸續上漲。</p>
<p>金潮</p>
<p>像是晴天打了一個霹靂，四月中旬，香港政府突如其來，頒發了一個禁止黃金買賣和私人持有的法令，明天便馬上執行。這麽一來，使整個香港都陷入滿城風雨，震動不已，金融市塲馬上成了混亂狀態，弄到人們都手足無措，日以繼夜的集會協議應付，金店關門。可是過不了幾天，這黃金潮是平伏了，原來大家都已知道，港府頒布這法令，是有着說不出的苦衷。</p>
<p>英國原是國際基金會會員之一，因為國際基金委會指責港政府是黃金走私的大本營，而且，黃金價格，也遠超乎國際基金會的規定，港府受了這種壓力，為了「表面」上盡會員的義務，就頒了這一個法令。然而，這不過是見諸文字上而已，執行與否，則是另一個問題，正如財政司當局所說：「居民用黃金建造房屋或飛機，政府也無意過問」。</p>
<p>現在，黃金期貨現貨外賣，一樣在盛行，價格更遠超過法令頒佈之前，不過，這次黃金潮的後果，卻是港幣無形貶值了。</p>
<p>夏景</p>
<p>南國的天氣，總比其他地方跑快一點，雖然現在還沒曾脫開暮春三月，但，在香港，已是夏天了。並不是香港人先知先覺，實在天氣太熱，人們已經換過季了，沉寂多時的海國，現有復甦，淺水灣頭，北角海上，每逢例假，就擠擠擁擁的，好不熱鬧？百貨店裏，飾櫥上的陳設，就給游泳用品佔了一大部份位置，游泳衣的花色，還是紅紅綠綠，大花大朶，式樣也跟前年的沒有多大差，女人所用的式樣，依然是一對乳罩一條三角褲而已。新近來，一些協助游泳的新發明的用具運到了，那就是膠掌套，這些套子分手腳用的，手套形如鴨掌，腳套卻似魚尾，還有一種膠眼鏡，去年都沒有見過的。大概是新鮮的出品，價格驚人。</p>
<p>七彩夏威夷衫，今年已被人遺棄了，起而代之的，是棗紅色的夏威夷衫上無色或灰色的長褲黑白三鑲皮鞋，整個變了香港道地慘綠少年。印度絲綢店子，幾日來都在忙着搬運貨物，女人專用的衣料，滾滾而來，忙煞了小姐們，也苦煞了先生們！</p>
<p>舞塲已轉入了淡月，並不會使你覺得怎樣熱鬧，戲院也是一樣，所以，名片都沒有上演，自然影片公司是有他們的打算，準備着天氣轉涼後的秋季攻勢。</p>
<h3>炮火下的物價</h3>
<p>（本報特稿）戰時物價的急速上漲，本是必然的現象。但這種上漲，也有其程度上的不同。有的上漲極多，有的上漲極少。大體說來，食物，燃料和日用品類的上漲，價格必然驚人，而高貴衣着和奢侈品類，就要差得遠了。這種情形，在上海歷次戰事中，都是如此的。舉例來說，二十六年八一三戰事起後，上海的米價，由八月一日的每斗一元一角六分漲至十五日的每斗一元五角；煤球更兇了，八月一日每担一元三角半，十五日每担二元，九月一日竟達三元。以當時物價和幣值的穩定情形來說，如此高速的漲風，已可算得是空前了。</p>
<p>上漲的原因</p>
<p>戰火逼近下物價的上漲，其原因是多方面的。歸納起來，當不脫下面的若干點：第一，由於軍事需用支出的浩大，通貨急速膨脹，幣值跌落；第二，由於一般人心的恐慌浮動，爭購必需的物資積藏備用，尤其是糧食和燃料；第三，由於投機商人的囤積壟斷，興風作波，以圖厚利；第四，一部分的耕田淪為戰塲，工厰亦無法生產，因此物資的供應成了問題；第五，對外交通中斷，物資的交流作用喪失，許多不必要的物資無法運出，而必要的物資則來源減少，因此漲者愈漲，跌者愈跌。</p>
<p>八一三舊例</p>
<p>我們且仍以二十六年八一三戰起時的情形為例。據統計，從八月到十月這三個月中，食物類增加了百分之十·二八；燃料增加了百分之三三·七二，而衣着類呢？卻反下跌了百分之一·一二，可見在戰時，人們只能顧到一點維持生存的飲食；至於穿着，就根本無暇顧及了。</p>
<p>燃料佔首位</p>
<p>此次戰事逼近上海以後，據非正式的統計，也仍以食物類和燃料類所漲最多，尤其是燃料，占第一位。這也有其必然的原因，因為就糧食論，本市存底頗豐，而回鄉運來也較方便；至於燃料的主體「煤」，則體積大，而且重，更須遠道運來，供應就大不及食糧的方便，所以上漲也最烈了。</p>
<p>鹹魚與木柵</p>
<p>有許多東西的上漲，是很畸形的。據熟悉商界情形的人士談，近半月來有幾種東西的上漲率，已超過糧食和燃料多多。一種是鹹黃魚，近日上海的街頭巷尾，或者臨街晒台上，到處可見晒亁的鹹黃魚，幾乎可以說是家家必有幾斤，其銷路的總數和何，當可想見。一個月前，在鹹魚行集中地的十六舖一帶，銀圓一圓可買到二十多斤，到後來，最貴的時候竟至買到五斤，現在則價格又下跌些。但在另一方面，鹹肉和火腿卻並不怎樣暢銷，限價時淸晨在火腿店前排隊每人限購一金的情形，並未再見，原因是因為畢竟太貴，雖然可以貯藏，其奈吃不起乎？所以就遠不及鹹黃魚的受小市民歡迎了；其次，是繩索，其漲勢之兇，令人不信。因為，軍事上的工事需要繩索，應變和逃難的人們也都需要繩索，因此，這東西雖不能吃，卻竟成了若干投機商人囤積的目標，價格猛烈上漲。又其次是木材，這只要看近日各里弄趕裝柵欄大門的一片叮當之聲，就可以想見一班了。</p>
<p>沒有人問津</p>
<p>最乏人問津的，除新式汽車，高貴收音機等等以外，外國貨的西裝料，也是其中之一。而這些東西，在去年限價初開放時，正是一般人爭先搶購的對象。曾幾何時，就如此被人冷落了。現在馬路上地攤林立，不乏許多高貴的衣料，這些都是那些大商店中因為生意淸淡，門可羅雀，只得叫伙計搬到馬路邊上來賣的。一套衣料，常只賣六七塊銀圓，這在戰前不過合半担米價，便宜固然是便宜，但買的人還是不大有，因為吃的問題實在太重要了，來日方長，不知如何過活，則做新西裝的念頭，也自然打消了。</p>
<p>銀圓的問題</p>
<p>如果照銀圓算來，現在的物價原並不算高。卽以米而論，戰前也要十二元；其他的東西，自然更不必說。戰前吃一客西餐，在中區是一元二三角，西區則達一元六七角。但現在西菜館的一般價錢，折合銀圓不過七八角。但問題是在：現在的人一個月能賺幾塊銀圓？一個普通的公教人員，大概只拿到五元左右；在生產機關裏的職員，一月能拿到二十塊銀圓的，已是不錯得很了。而戰前，當一個小學教員有四五十塊，一個月掙百把塊錢的不算稀罕。如此一比，則今日的一塊銀圓，其身價已無形中高了不知多少倍，要化掉它自然非十分鄭重將事不可了。</p>

<p>我是美亞照像館內的傭僕，家住本市開封路一〇六號二層擱上。平我按月的薪金所得，總是全數的拿回家去，養活我的老母和幼女二人。在去年，我的大腹內患着一個惡瘤，漸漸地膨大，時作劇痛，因為平日沒有積蓄，無力求醫診治。可是病勢越來越厲害了，在本月初，我在萬分忍不住之下，只好告假求醫，向親友與鄰居四處挪借了十多塊銀元，來作診療費用，現在住中山醫院三樓七十七號病房。</p>
<p>醫生告訴我，我的病不是住幾天醫院就可以好的，必須要開刀，並且因我血液枯涸的原故，在開刀前，須先輸血，單這輸血一項費用，要大頭五十只。唉！像我這樣一個早不做夜不活的人，叫我怎樣拿得出這筆浩大的費用呢！況且每日的住院費也要一元二角，我曾經懇求過醫院當局酌予減少，可是畢竟使我失望了。</p>
<p>我的病倘使不去治它，照醫生說，至多再有二個月光景的生望。唉！我死雖不足惜，然而相依為命的老母與弱女，今後將怎樣活命！所以，我在無路可投的現在，還想拼我最後的殘喘，掙扎着懇求先生給我披露我的苦衷，並呼籲慈善家的同情援助。尤望能代向中山醫院當局，懇求破例減少各項費用，使垂死之人得有生望。救得我一家三口之生命，則各大善士及先生，鄙人生當供奉，死亦啣恩也。敬請　撰安　病者崔傑光謹上　五·十一·</p>

<h3>「限田」在廣西</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　梁雨山</p>
<p>〔桂林訊〕在目前，限田滅租的土地政策，已經是全國一致的當前急務。桂省當局，從去年到今年，卽以實現「耕者有其田」為最重要縣政之一。</p>
<p>綜觀本省土地分配情形，大地主雖或比他省為少，而在相對的情況下，卻顯露着「富者連田阡陌，貧者無立錐之地」的現象，大河一帶如容縣，桂平，平南等縣，有年租九千担的富家，其他七八千担至千担左右的更復不少；貴縣，鬱林一帶有連自己也不知道自己究竟有多少積穀的大地主。由於地主的鬼譎操縱和辦理地政者推行不力，工作困難重重。</p>
<p>一般情形，（一）「田」與「賦」脫節，換約不易推行。限田政策之推行，必須先辦土地測量，而地方以前土地陳報辦理不善，致賦政混亂，一由不知其賦其何，一家不知其有田幾畝，「田」「賦」因以脫節，買賣田地均有困難，換約自不能談判。（二）地主富紳操縱地方勢力，滅租限田，甚感棘手。今年本省推行限田後，地主見機做祟，儘量分戶分佔，化整為零，以圖規避，減租一事，更為難行，其中原因，乃為佃農過多，相爭領種，限田工作，上下視同具文，許多地方，竟以一紙佈告了之。（三）地主賣田無人要，主佃和諧之地區如昭平，蒙山一帶，田主多願出售超額，突出的崖，佃農或因貧苦，或因觀望，不肯價購，加以少數田主高抬田價，致限田政策無法進展。</p>
<p>政府方面：地方推行不力，田畝測丈，差錯弊漏，地籍，戶籍整理工作，尚待複查，諸如此類以致限田準備工作方面阻力特多</p>
<p>總括絕大多數參議員，均眾口一詞，堅決表示：「推行限田我們認為最重要的是將佃農貧農組織起來，使他們成為土地改革的主動力量，同時政府要有不怕得罪豪門巨室的勇氣和決心，始終貫澈進行，然後土地改革才不致徒托空言。」同時認為政府應嚴厲執行，公教人員以身作則，率先倡導。大多數參議員，急欲限田見於實現。參議員等均來自民間，這些都是代表人民的意見，民意所歸，政府應該利用此良機，針對實際的困難，大刀闊斧，以底於成，人民希望這實現，國家需要這實現。</p>
<p>高山的茶葉怎麽這樣好呢？因為在春季正出嫩葉的時候，茶農不把它摘盡，再吐的小芽（呌着母子茶）因恐樹受傷，又不摘它，到了冬天，再把茶樹根傍邊的枯草翻起，等到翌年春天氣候和暖，它才發新芽，因為山高氣寒的關係所以較平原的地方出產遲</p>
<p>兩種試驗</p>
<p>讀者要想試騐好茶葉，這裏有兩個好辦法：你用一個亁淨的磁碗，將茶葉放少許在碗裏，用沸水冲泡，稍等片刻，其葉枝枝開放，肥壯的，婉無鯨魚游於水面，仔細看，尚有蟲眼，形如支「，」點一樣大，未吃穿者，其葉最佳；因為高山出的茶葉，含有甜汁，難免沒有寄生蟲，旣有甜汁，蟲不會不吃，山高地肥，長的茶葉片張厚，所以在短短幾十天茶葉下山的期間，蟲沒有力量把它吃穿一個洞，這就是好茶葉。二，有一個最簡單的試騐辦法：將泡過的茶葉，拈一片起來，用手輕輕撕開，其葉在破裂時便現出許多像藕絲一樣的細絲，那種茶葉也很好。</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Defense War Develops Towards a Climax: Heavy Casualties for the Communist Army in Pudong, Retreating Towards Qujiazhai in Luxing Town</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters announced the battle situation: (1) Yesterday was the seventh day since the prelude to the Shanghai Defense War began. There was contact on all lines. Observing the overall situation, the war is developing towards a climax. In recent days, the lines of Yuepu, Yangxing, and Liuhang, as well as Chuansha in Pudong, have been the most intense. Although the bandits mobilized their elite forces to attack our areas fiercely, our defending troops were incredibly brave and determined to defend and counterattack their positions to the death, so the bandits were ultimately unable to succeed. After a night of fierce fighting from the evening of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, the bandits suffered heavy casualties. A certain unit of our army in the Yangxing area attacked the bandits facing them at noon yesterday. After three hours of fierce fighting, the bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, retreated three li. After our army completed the task of annihilating the bandits, they returned to their original positions to defend them, so the daytime battles in the Yuepu and Liuhang areas were quiet. (2) According to the captured bandits, a certain bandit army in the Yuepu, Yangxing, and other areas has suffered heavy casualties since the beginning of the battle. The remaining troops have lost their combat capabilities and have now been replaced by a certain follow-up unit, preparing to make a comeback. The morale of our front line is high, and we are waiting in full battle array to give the invading bandits a serious blow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters announced the battle situation on the 18th: (1) A portion of the bandits began to harass our Yangxing position again at 8:00 p.m. yesterday (the 17th). Another group of scattered bandits attempted to infiltrate our positions at Shizilin and Yuepu. Our army, in order to thoroughly eliminate the invading bandits, coordinated infantry, artillery, and air forces to intercept them. The bandit army suffered heavy casualties, and their offensive was thwarted. By dawn, the fighting on the entire line had subsided. (2) The invading bandits, with four cannons attached, attempted to infiltrate the Qian Family Residence south of our Xitang Bridge. A certain unit of our army dispatched strong troops to attack the flanks of the bandits. The bandits abandoned more than 30 corpses and retreated towards Xiaonanxiang. (3) A certain army of ours organized a commando team at 5:00 a.m. this morning (the 18th) to sweep away the bandits in Xin Zhuang. The bandits fled upon hearing the news, and our army safely returned to their defenses at 7:00 a.m. (4) The battle in Pudong has already begun. From dusk yesterday (the 17th) to this morning (the 18th), the bandits launched attacks in separate groups against our forward positions in Jinjia Bridge, Xinlu Town, Sajiazhai, and other places. The defending troops, in coordination with the navy, air force, and artillery, continuously bombarded the bandits fiercely, especially the artillery, whose power directly bombarded the bandit reinforcements. Because the bandits suffered too many casualties, they retreated towards Qujiazhai in Luxing Town. Our army is currently pursuing and suppressing them.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Tang Issues a Statement: Exert Great Strength to Win the Final Victory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] A reporter visited Commander-in-Chief Tang at the front line yesterday. He took the time out of his busy schedule to receive the reporter and said: "The Songhu Defense War began on the 12th and has now lasted for a week. The Communist bandits have successively attacked Yuepu, Yangxing, Qibao, and Pudong, and the fighting has been extremely fierce. Our army, relying on its high morale and strong fortifications, has dealt severe blows to the invading bandits everywhere. The 28th and 29th armies of the bandits have already been routed and cannot form an army. Their newly added 31st and 33rd armies, as well as the 25th and 30th armies that attacked Pudong, have also been severely hit. Although the bandits have repeatedly changed and redeployed their troops and continued to attack in recent days, under the close coordination of our navy, army, and air force, we have continuously inflicted heavy damage on them, causing them heavy losses and achieving preliminary victories. The purpose of this war to defend Greater Shanghai is to protect the freedom, lives, and property of the six million citizens of Shanghai, and to protect the only economic and cultural center of the country. As the war approaches the suburbs of the city, the citizens of the city remain calm and composed, living as usual, and enthusiastically launching a campaign to support the troops, which shows that cherishing freedom is a basic requirement of everyone. This is indeed a gratifying phenomenon. I am entrusted with the responsibility of defending the territory and protecting the people. I have the greatest determination to protect the lives and property of the citizens of Shanghai and to maintain the equipment of the factories. I must do my best to maintain the peace and order of the urban area. If there are unscrupulous elements and communist spies who spread rumors, slander, and attempt to divide the feelings between our army and the people, or harass and rob, they will be killed without mercy. When our officers and soldiers of the navy, army, and air force, and all the citizens cooperate closely and with one heart and one mind, fighting for freedom, I believe that we will be able to exert great strength and win the final victory of the Lacquer Shanghai Defense War, and the suburbs of Shanghai will definitely be the graveyard of the Communist bandits, without any doubt."</p>
<h3>The National Army's Positions in Yuepu and Yangxing are as Solid as a Rock</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th: (1) In the Yuepu, Shizilin, and Yangxing areas, the bandit army's offensive has been repeatedly thwarted for days, and the total number of casualties is more than two armies, but the bandit army is very stubborn and does not hesitate to treat human lives as child's play. Starting at 8:00 p.m. last night (the 17th), they tried to attack again. Therefore, from last night to dawn today, the sound of artillery was deafening, the sound of killing shook the sky, and it was extremely tragic. After a night of fierce fighting, our army's position is still as solid as a rock, and we have achieved great results. (2) About three to four hundred bandits in the northeast area of Xiaonanxiang concentrated their firepower and harassed the area at 7:00 p.m. last night. Our defending troops immediately launched a fierce counterattack. The battle situation developed to 1:00 a.m. this morning and became even more intense. The area was brightly lit. The bandit army saw that we were prepared and had no chance to take advantage of the situation, so their offensive stopped immediately. The two sides are currently in a stalemate. (3) Last night (the 17th), the bandits mobilized frequently and gathered in the area near Shen Zhuang south of Zhoupu Hesha, which seems to indicate an intention to attack Sanlintang. We are on strict alert. (4) Last night (the 17th), our aircraft groups continuously flew out and fiercely bombed the bandits in Chuansha Zhoupu. Also, our artillery, in coordination with armored vehicles, shelled the bandits in Xujialu, Caojialu, and Xinlu Town all night long. Bandit corpses were scattered all over the field, and our army is waiting for an opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th: (1) Starting at 8:00 p.m. on the 17th, the bandits used all their strength and repeatedly launched a fierce attack on our Yangxing position using human wave tactics. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of our defending troops fought bravely and counterattacked. At the same time, our divine eagles launched illumination bombs on the bandit positions at night and discovered the bandit artillery positions. Our Wusong Fortress artillery then fiercely bombarded the bandits. Under the guidance of the air force, all the bandit artillery positions were destroyed by us. The battle situation became more and more fierce, and the morale became higher and higher. By the morning of the 18th, the fighting gradually subsided, and our position remained intact. (2) More than a thousand remnants of the bandits sneaked into our army's position in Yuepu Town at dawn on the 17th. Our unit was ordered to attack and completely surrounded the bandits in the area at 9:00 a.m. After three hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were completely annihilated. More than 200 people were captured alive, and three flat-fire guns, more than 20 light and heavy machine guns, hundreds of submachine guns and rifles, and many other spoils of war were seized. (3) More than two thousand remnant bandits launched a fierce attack on our Liujiahang Garrison position using human wave tactics at dusk on the 17th. Our officers and soldiers responded calmly, and the invading bandits suffered heavy losses and casualties. Our position remained unshaken, and the battle was still continuing at dawn on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th: In Pudong, starting at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the bandits used the strength of an army to launch a frontal attack on a certain unit of ours, continuously for more than eight times. Our army coordinated infantry and artillery to launch a counterattack against the bandits. Bandit corpses were piled up like mountains, mostly innocent young men and strong men who were temporarily coerced to act as human shields. In addition, two regiments of bandits who sneaked into Tiedelangzhong Bridge Town in Donggou are currently being surrounded and severely attacked by a certain unit of ours. Detailed battle results are being investigated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Military News: After 11:00 p.m. on the night of the 17th, the bandits in Shizilin, Yuepu, Yangxing, Liuhang, and other places launched continuous wave-like offensives against us, all of which failed. According to reports from the front, the severity of the bandit casualties was the highest seen in the week since the Shanghai Defense War began.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Songhu Defense Headquarters issued a battle report: (1) More than three thousand bandits harassed Xinlu Renqiao, Zhangjiangzha, and other places at around 9:00 p.m. on the 17th. Our defending troops blocked and attacked them separately. The bandits tried several times to break through our army's position, but all failed. Our loyal and brave officers and soldiers became more and more courageous as they fought, giving the bandits a head-on blow. In this battle, more than a thousand bandits were killed or wounded, more than a hundred were captured alive, and countless spoils of war were seized. Detailed battle results are being investigated.

In this battle, more than two thousand bandits were killed or wounded, and more than four hundred were captured alive. Detailed battle results are still being investigated.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Gui Leads the Fleet to Bombard the Communist Army in Pudong District</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Navy Commander-in-Chief General Gui Yongqing has been supervising multiple ships of the Navy's × Fleet for days. In cooperation with the army and air force outside Wusongkou, they have shelled the bandit army invading the Northwest defense line of Shanghai in the Yuepu and Yangxing areas, achieving great results. Now, because the bandit army is moving in Pudong again, in addition to ordering Commander Ma Jizhuang of the × Fleet to command his brave subordinates to attack, he also personally took the government ship on patrol to the waters of Pudong and Wusong districts yesterday morning (the 18th), using fierce artillery fire to severely annihilate the invading bandit army, killing and wounding thousands of people. According to Commander-in-Chief Gui, the army will cooperate with the army in combat and is determined to defend Greater Shanghai with all its strength and give the bandit army a serious blow. In the past three years, the navy has been operating in the Yangtze River area. Although the river surface is narrow and the back is easily threatened, it has not been able to fully exert its combat power, but thanks to the officers and soldiers who have worked hard, it has still been able to achieve the intended mission and achieve great results. For example, naval ships cooperated with Wu Zhongjian's army to defend Anqing for a long time, annihilating tens of thousands of bandits, causing the bandits not to dare to look directly at it. If the entire war situation had not changed, Anqing would never have been occupied by the bandits. At present, in the Shanghai Defense War, the navy's scope of activities is wide, and it is cooperating with a strong army and air force. I believe that it will be able to defend it without any worries.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Tang Commander-in-Chief Enber believes that the ships of the Navy's × Fleet have made great contributions to the war to defend Greater Shanghai, especially in crushing the bandit army's attempt to break through the Yuepu Yangxing defense line and occupy the Wusong District. They have made great contributions to stabilizing the war situation. In addition to personally going to Commander Ma's flagship to express his encouragement, he will also issue a reward of 20,000 silver dollars to reward all the loyal and brave officers and soldiers of the ship.</p>
<h3>The Jiangnan Volunteer Corps Assists the National Army in Combat</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] On the 16th of this month, the Communist bandits in the Sanlintang area near Minhang attempted to coordinate with the general offensive to encircle Greater Shanghai and repeatedly launched sneak attacks around Sanlintang. The first battalion of the seventh detachment of the third general team of the Jiangnan Volunteer Corps of the Youth Salvation Corps was stationed there. The battalion commander Cao Yingwu immediately led more than 400 officers and soldiers to bravely attack. After day and night of fighting, they gave the Communist bandits a serious blow and finally caused them to flee in defeat. A few officers and soldiers of the battalion also sacrificed heroically. However, it is noted that the Volunteer Corps is a civilian armed force, composed entirely of patriotic and enthusiastic young people. Ammunition and supplies are self-raised. After continuous battles with the bandits, the ammunition is exhausted and the food is depleted. The team has telegraphed the Municipal National Defense Department's Civilian Armed Forces Supervision Office, requesting that it find a way to quickly replenish it so that it can continue to kill the enemy and strengthen the defense line of Greater Shanghai, and give play to the patriotic and revolutionary spirit of the enthusiastic young people. It is heard that the Municipal Supervision Office will immediately report the battle experience of the battalion to Commander-in-Chief Tang, requesting that he quickly replenish the battalion with food and ammunition, and also requesting that the food and ammunition be widely distributed to the general teams under the jurisdiction of the Supervision Office so that the volunteer salvation soldiers stationed in the suburbs can serve the country.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Radio Revises the Time for Reporting War News</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Shanghai Radio originally planned to broadcast war news twice a day, at 12:00 noon and 11:00 p.m., starting yesterday. Now, due to transmission needs, it has not been timely, so the broadcast time will be changed to 12:45 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. and 12:00 p.m. to 12:15 a.m. from today onwards, reporting twice a day. It started on time last night, and all radio stations in the city will rebroadcast it.</p>
<h3>The Air Force Conducts Extensive Bombing and Strafing, Achieving Fruitful Results</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Shanghai Defense War has been going on for the seventh day on the 18th. Although the Communist army disregards casualties, it still concentrates its attacks on the Wusong Fortress area. It is obvious that it has discovered that it is not easy to attack here, so it has also gathered troops in Pudong, trying to approach the east bank of the river facing the Bund area of Shanghai in order to threaten the urban area of Shanghai from the side. Our army had already anticipated that the Communist army would take this path, so it had already pre-arranged positions in the Pudong area. On the 18th, the Wusong Fortress area and the Pudong area were fighting fiercely at the same time. The air force also concentrated heavy troops over the Wusong area and the Pudong area, bombing and strafing the Communist army, and extensively bombing and strafing the Communist army's supply lines outside the Greater Shanghai defense circle. The results are as follows: (1) Destroyed four Communist army artillery positions northwest of Yuepu, three artillery positions in Fanjiabridge north of Liuhang, and twenty wooden boats inside Xiaonei River from Luodian to Yuepu, and thirty wooden boats from Liuhe to Luodian. More than 1,000 Communist army soldiers were killed or wounded in the Yuepu South Gujiazhai and Yangxing Northwest Baziqiao fortifications. (2) Killed or wounded 200 Communist army soldiers in Zhoupu Town, Pudong, 100 Communist army soldiers in Yangjiazhai, and 200 Communist army soldiers in Tanzhi Bridge, Nanhui. Assisted the army in capturing Xiaoliangshan on the east bank of Xiaonei River southeast of the Texaco Oil Depot, destroyed two Communist army positions there, destroyed thirty wooden boats in Zhoujiazhai River Mouth southwest of Lin Yong in Zhoupu Town, ten wooden boats on the seashore of Zhangjialu, and destroyed thirty Communist army wooden boats trying to cross the river in Xiaonei River Mouth, Pujiang, opposite Longhua Airport. (3) Assisted the army near Nanxiang in fighting the Communist army in Lujiazhai, destroyed two Communist army fortifications there, and killed or wounded more than 100 Communist army soldiers. (4) Destroyed one speedboat and five tugboats in the Shihu Danghe River, and killed or wounded 600 Communist army soldiers. (5) Discovered five Communist army train cars from Suzhou to Kunshan and destroyed two of them.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Consults the Executive Yuan to Support the Government's War</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The legislators of the Legislative Yuan, in view of the fact that the Chinese Communists are superstitious in force and disregard credibility, and during the peace talks, they proposed their so-called eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" and set a deadline for acceptance, and brazenly launched a large-scale southern invasion, expanding the war and slaughtering the people, the responsibility for this destruction of peace should be borne by the Chinese Communists. Therefore, at the nineteenth meeting, it passed the "Resolution to Support the Government's Continued War against the Chinese Communists". Yesterday, it specially consulted the Executive Yuan for review. The consultation and resolution are recorded below: Consultation: The nineteenth meeting of the third session of this court has passed the "Resolution to Support the Government's Continued War against the Chinese Communists" for destroying peace, and the record is on file. The corresponding copy of the "Resolution to Support the Government's Continued War against the Chinese Communists" is attached for review. Since New Year's Day of this year, the government has followed public opinion, advocated peace, and tried its best to accommodate and tolerate, sincerely hoping to obtain a fair, reasonable, comprehensive, and permanent peace. This court held a meeting in Beijing and resolved to unanimously support the government's peace policy and called on the Chinese Communists to cease fire. Unexpectedly, during the peace talks, the Chinese Communists proposed their so-called eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the domestic peace agreement and set a deadline for acceptance. They then launched an offensive, crossed the Yangtze River, invaded the south, expanded the war, and slaughtered the people. The responsibility for this destruction of peace should be borne by the Chinese Communists. The facts are all there and are recognized by the people of the whole country. Based on past experience, the colleagues of this court deeply understand the Chinese Communist's attempt to subvert the country and enslave the people. In other words, (1) the war launched by the Chinese Communists is an international war of aggression, not a simple domestic war. (2) The Chinese Communists are fighting against all the people who love freedom. This war is not a war between parties, but a war between good people against violence. (3) The Chinese Communists seized power by violence, and their purpose is to destroy democracy and implement totalitarian politics. (4) Under the Chinese Communist rule, not only are the lives and property of the people not guaranteed, but families are broken up, ethics are confused, and the people have no possibility of free life. Our people throughout the country must rise up together to fight for survival, for freedom, for human justice, to defend our homeland, and to maintain national independence. We must support the government, unite the anti-communist front, and fight to the end until the Chinese Communists abandon their dream of conquering by force and achieve the final victory.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Citizens Eagerly Launch Work to Comfort the Wounded, Gu Zhenggang, Lei Zhen, and Others Go to the Pudong Front Line to Support the Troops</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The mutual aid association of the No. 19 district vegetable market vendors on Pingliang Road in this city, the former chairman Shen Changsheng, the current chairman Zhang Er, and the chief of general affairs Yao Huaian, etc., are angered by the rebellious behavior of the communist bandits, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, and automatically launched the association members to engage in the work of comforting the wounded in order to cooperate with the Greater Shanghai Defense War. In the past, they automatically purchased dozens of pieces of white cloth for the second group of the No. 65 Hospital on Pingliang Road to bandage the wounds of the officers and soldiers wounded in the front, and decorated the ward with a new look. They also prepared cooked white rice porridge every day to supply the wounded. For the more seriously wounded officers and soldiers, those who did not eat porridge were cooked and sent longan sweet soup. They personally mobilized personnel to serve them. In addition, they also donated a large number of cigarettes, biscuits, bread, candy, and other items, and organized a service team from the 17th to do hard work such as writing letters, washing and mending clothes for the wounded. The wounded comrades in the group were all grateful to the chairman of the association, the chief of general affairs, and the members for their enthusiasm, and they all vowed to return to the front line after their health recovered to annihilate the enemy bandits and complete the task of defending Greater Shanghai to repay the elders and brothers of the association.</p>
<p>In addition, the commander of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison has commended Shen Changsheng, Zhang Er, Yao Huaian, and other members for their patriotic enthusiasm to encourage them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The second group of the No. 65 Wounded Soldier Hospital on Pingliang Road in this city accommodated more than 200 lightly and severely wounded soldiers on the evening of the 15th. Because it was difficult to find a ward for a while, a temporary sick room was set up in the two-story vegetable market of the Pingliang Road small vegetable market to carry out first aid. On the morning of the 16th, when citizens went to the vegetable market to buy vegetables, they found the heroic soldiers who were wounded in the battle to defend Shanghai were groaning. Thousands of people gathered around to watch and express their condolences. They were all deeply moved and sent various comfort items and biscuits, piled up like mountains. There were also those who donated Yuan heads. On the afternoon of the 16th, five people died due to serious injuries. Countless citizens automatically carried incense candles and tin foil to burn. At 3:00 p.m. that afternoon, when Pushan Villa went to collect the bodies, there were still several citizens following and crying. From this, we can see a glimpse of the Shanghai citizens' respect for heroic generals.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Silver Yuan Price Listed Today!</h3>
<p>The issue of listing the price of silver yuan, which has been brewing for a long time, has been decided by the Central Bank yesterday that it will officially list the price of silver yuan starting today. Three measures have been decided: (1) Silver yuan will be listed starting today; (2) The Central Bank will resume issuing silver yuan for the overnight deposit balances of various banks and firms starting today; (3) Various banks and firms should issue silver yuan to customers as much as possible from their reserves starting today. As for the price of silver yuan and the percentage of silver yuan issued by the Central Bank to various banks and firms, it will be decided this afternoon.</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, the Gold and Silver Equalization Committee of the Central Bank originally planned to implement it on the 16th of this month, but later feared that it would stimulate prices and did not materialize. It is said that the authorities, considering the high or low price of silver yuan directly affects the stability of the market, felt that it was necessary to consider it. However, according to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, if the price of silver yuan is not listed as soon as possible, the gap between the black market price and the official price of silver yuan will widen, and labor-management disputes will arise repeatedly when new salaries are paid in the middle of the month, making it impossible to reach a coordination. Therefore, representatives have been sent to appeal for remedial measures. Originally, it is unreasonable to rigidly regulate the price of silver yuan. If the listing of silver yuan is not realized as soon as possible, it will be difficult for the city's economy and finance to return to the normal track.</p>
<p>Since the authorities rigidly stipulated the exchange rate of silver yuan to gold yuan at 1:4 million, the price of silver yuan seems to have become relatively stable, and the general price level seems to have also stabilized. However, this is only a superficial observation. If we analyze it carefully, we will know that this idea is completely inadequate.</p>
<p>First, the essential requirement for limiting the price of silver yuan is that all kinds of silver yuan are universally used regardless of the version. Under this circumstance, it is difficult to escape Gresham's Law of "bad money drives out good money." Therefore, the market has been full of Eagle, Dragon Yang, and miscellaneous silver yuan transactions in recent days, while Big Head and Small Head have disappeared.</p>
<p>Second, before the price limit, the market prices of Eagle, Dragon Yang, and miscellaneous silver yuan were mostly around 3 million yuan. Since the rate of 1 silver yuan to 4 million yuan was stipulated, the prices of Big Head and Small Head have increased even more. However, there are also those who sell at the legal price, but that is only because middle and lower class families and salaried people have to endure the pain of selling "Big Heads" to meet the expenses of firewood, rice, oil, and salt.</p>
<p>Third, some attribute the recent phenomenon of price stability or decline to the price limit of silver yuan. In fact, this statement is extremely far-fetched, because the price stability or decline does not refer to all prices, but is limited to some luxury goods and non-essential goods. The stability or decline of these many items is due to sluggish sales, weak purchasing power, and poor turnover of industry and commerce, not because silver yuan itself has this magic power. On the contrary, the prices of essential commodities such as rice and vegetables have risen several times. From this, it can be explained that price increases and decreases are entirely due to environmental and supply-demand relationships.</p>
<p>From the above facts, it can be seen that rigidly limiting the price of silver yuan does not help much in suppressing prices. Moreover, the price of silver yuan is always fixed at the rate of 4 million yuan, which not only loses the normal transaction of silver yuan, but also causes the price of silver yuan in this city to become out of sync due to the higher price of silver yuan elsewhere. For example, a few days ago, the official price of Big Head silver yuan in Fuzhou was only 4 million yuan. The distance between the two is so large, how can it not force the outflow of Big Heads?</p>
<p>The reason why we advocate the listing of the price of silver yuan now is not only because the prices of silver yuan in various places are . In fact, although silver yuan is not a legal currency, it already has the form of currency and . Therefore, its status in society cannot be taken lightly. Also, because it has real value compared to the gold yuan and is more active than commodities, it can be converted into currency or goods at any time. Therefore, its price is naturally more stable. This phenomenon is especially prominent in "Big Heads" that are used as speculative chips. In the current situation, there is no reason to suppress it. Therefore, we believe that the authorities' regulations on the price of silver yuan should not be too rigid, nor should they be too low. We are still in a chaotic period. It is definitely not easy to manage the price limit well. If we go the other way and guide everything according to the situation, it will be easier to achieve more concrete results.</p>
<p>The most obvious drawback of limiting the price of silver yuan is that the Central Bank does not have silver yuan income at the official price, and the silver yuan issued in the items of industry and commerce and ordinary banks is priced at the officially set rate. Although this loss is a loss for the Central Bank, it is actually a loss for the national treasury. There is also the issue of industrial and commercial enterprises inflating the number of workers and falsely claiming "rationed" silver yuan. It is not absolutely non-existent, and the fact that general banks and firms are unwilling to "ration" the "rationed" silver yuan to customers at the official price is even more well known. Therefore, fixing the official price only creates opportunities for a few people to gain special benefits. To this day, the country still has to suffer this unnecessary loss, and we really want to speak up for it.</p>
<p>Economic phenomena are obviously different from political and military phenomena. All facts must conform to the balanced state of natural development. If we want to break this balanced situation, it will form a deformed development that is not suitable for economic principles. The attitude we hold towards the price of silver yuan can be explained by this. In the current stage, if we want the price of silver yuan to be consistent with the natural level, we can only abandon the price limit policy, establish an open market for silver yuan on the one hand, and have the Central Bank's Gold and Silver Equalization Committee refer to the actual situation in the market and adjust the price of each version of silver yuan day by day. Only in this way can we break the deadlock of the silver yuan price issue. As for how to prevent the excessive rigidity of the silver yuan price, it depends on the Central Bank's strength in controlling silver yuan. But, in any case, the Central Bank's decisive decision to start listing prices from today is still a wise measure.</p>
<h3>The Front Line at Yuepu</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Shi Zhi</p>
<p>[Report from our office on the 18th] In the dim morning light, my colleague, the newspaper's photographer Lu Shunxing, and I drove our jeep towards the Jiangwan-Wusong and Wuyuepu roads to conduct our first battlefield visit since the outbreak of the Shanghai Defense War. In terms of distance, although the round trip was less than 100 kilometers, the hardships we encountered on this trip, especially the thrilling scenes, were unprecedented in my 12 years as a war correspondent. Similarly, the hardships and high morale of the front-line soldiers were also unprecedented in my 12 years as a war correspondent. The issue concerning the safety of Shanghai's six million citizens can now be answered in this short article, and as Lu Shunxing said, "This is simply a miracle."</p>
<p>At the Jiangwan Garrison, we first contacted Director Chen Binghuan and General Liu Yuzhang of a certain army by phone. He allowed us to visit his command post for a brief meeting. Accompanied by Section Chief Wang Shupeng, we arrived at the command post in a certain place in Wusong at around 10:00 AM. I hadn't seen General Liu for five or six years. This time, I only felt that he was much thinner than before. Due to commanding the battle for six days and six nights without sleep and constantly holding the telephone, his voice was obviously hoarse. But one thing I have no doubt about is that his spirit has always been full, overflowing with infinite vitality and combat power. This vitality and combat power also symbolize his strong and fighting spirit and fighting will.</p>
<p>This army of General Liu's, whose first and second commanders were Guan Linzheng and Zhang Yaoming, has already written countless epic poems of heroism and sacrifice during the War of Resistance. The only key to its victory over the enemy is the three key points of combat advocated by General Guan Linzheng: "Steady! - Endure! - Root!" This unit still maintains this excellent tradition. Although General Liu only took over as commander after General Qin Yizhi last April, he achieved "three victories in three battles" in the Northeast from July to the end of last year, recovering Liaoyang, attacking Anshan, and recovering Yingkou, completely annihilating Lin Biao's Liaonan Iron Army's Ninth Column - making the enemy tremble at the mention of it. After Liu's unit was transferred south, in the Shanghai Defense War, it was arranged by Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo as the "New Great Wall of Shanghai" without consideration, placed in the most demanding line from Wusong, Shizilin, through Yuepu, Yanglin to Liuhang. General Liu also lived up to the heavy trust of Commander Tang, and has already "tried his hand" and defeated two communist armies in the opening battle of the week-long Shanghai battle.</p>
<p>Our conversation with General Liu was very brief. Because he had to go to the front line to command the battle immediately, besides paying my respects to him and asking about the residence of Commander Zhang Yaoming, there was only Shunxing's photography. Then, he introduced Chief of Staff Hou Chengda to meet me and asked him to tell me about the current battle situation.</p>
<p>Chief of Staff Hou was also an old friend from the War of Resistance. We hadn't met for many years, and it was naturally very kind to meet again, and it made people feel the loveliness and warmth of friendship. Although he was also very busy and had not slept peacefully for six days and nights, he still patiently told me about the battle situation of the past six days.</p>
<p>Chief of Staff Hou first told me that this army had won a great victory. The facts are there and need no emphasis: "Chen Yi's 28th and 29th armies have been killed or wounded by four-fifths of their number, a total of about 30,000 people. Especially the 28th Army of Chen Yi's troops, which is known for its strong attacks, was originally the Ninth Column. In the past, it was the main force in Shandong, attacking Weixian, occupying Yanzhou, and attacking Jinan." Because I lived in Shandong for a long time, I knew more about the quality of Chen Yi's troops. Of course, I had no doubt about what Chief of Staff Hou said.</p>
<p>Chief of Staff Hou continued: Chen Yi's intention was originally to order the 28th and 29th armies to start attacking on the night of the 12th and to order the two armies to break through the positions of the National Army at Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang by the 15th, occupy Wusong, block the Huangpu River, cut off the water connection of the National Army in Shanghai, and then suppress and surround the National Army in Shanghai to carry out the old trick of a "local peace" like in Beiping. He did not expect that on the night of the 12th, after a battalion entered the streets of Yuepu Town using infiltration tactics, the troops guarding in each bunker were not moved at all. After dawn, they joined the reinforcements and, under the personal command of General Liu on the front line of Xinzhen, completely annihilated them. From the 14th to the 15th, for three consecutive days, the communists launched fierce attacks on the entire line from Shizilin in the north, through Yuepu, Yanghang, and Liuhang. In order to gain the initiative, the National Army also counterattacked, so the battle was the fiercest during these three days, and the communist army also suffered the heaviest casualties during these three days. By the 16th, Chen Yi's 28th and 29th armies had not only failed to complete their original mission of breaking through the positions of the National Army and occupying Wusong, but also suffered casualties reaching four-fifths of the entire army. As a result, they were forced to retreat to the second line in the first half of the night of the 16th, taking advantage of the heavy rain to reorganize, and replaced the defense with the 31st and 33rd armies. Because the two armies learned from the previous loss, they changed their tactics to actively attack our entire line at night, while we only launched local attacks at night, and attacked the enemy during the day with the coordination of the sea and air forces. Therefore, as of noon on the 18th, the communist army had not gained any advantage, and the combat power shown by the 31st and 32nd armies was significantly weaker than that of the 28th and 29th armies, especially the 28th Army.</p>
<p>After Chief of Staff Hou reported on the battle situation of the past six days, he finally told me the reasons for the National Army's victory: (1) High morale, (2) Full preparation, (3) Orders carried out, (4) Consistent coordination between the sea, land, and air forces, (5) Flexible command. The reasons for the communist army's failure this time: (1) Copying the past, they intended to break through a point with elite troops, go straight to Wusong, and trap Shanghai, thus committing the mistake of light troops and rapid advance, making it easy for us to annihilate them one by one. (2) They are a "long attack," and we are a "short hit." The so-called "short hit" means one is "short fire" (annihilating the enemy within a short distance), and the other is "short time" (annihilating the enemy in a very short time). Both of these can save ammunition and can encircle and annihilate the enemy. (3) The "human wave tactics" used by the communist army can also be called "duck driving tactics," driving a batch of ducks to the front line. After a batch dies, another batch comes. Fortunately, "they are not their own sons." It is really too inhumane, but this kind of "duck driving tactics" encounters the National Army's well-planned and strong "plum blossom formation" and the elusive "ever-victorious army," and it is just like a mouse getting into an iron cage, "only in and no out."</p>

<h3>British Secretary of State McNeil Announces Non-Recognition of the Franco Government; Unwavering Policy Towards Spain; US Export-Import Bank Temporarily Not Considering Loans to Spain</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 18th] At the United Nations General Assembly's plenary session the day before yesterday, the vote on the proposal by South American countries to urge all countries to re-appoint ambassadors and plenipotentiary ministers to Madrid failed to pass because it did not obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. Sixteen countries, including Britain, the United States, and France, abstained, twenty-six countries supported the proposal, and fifteen countries voted against it. When clarifying Britain's attitude, British representative and Secretary of State McNeil stated that the government's policy towards Spain remains consistent. The British government believed that the United Nations General Assembly's resolution in December 1946 to withdraw diplomatic envoys stationed in Madrid would not be effective, and this prediction has proven to be accurate. However, the British government has complied with the resolution and withdrawn its ambassador to Madrid. The British government cannot support the proposal of South American countries because it wants to avoid being misunderstood as agreeing to the actions of Franco and his government. McNeil also stated that neither the British government nor the British people can agree with Franco and his totalitarian government's followers; nor can they agree with the various actions of prohibiting assembly, controlling speech, not conducting fair trials, and prohibiting criticism.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Well-informed sources said: The Export-Import Bank today rejected the request of Moreni Yang, President of the US-Spanish Bank in Madrid, for a loan of 1.2 billion US dollars to Spain. A senior official of the Export-Import Bank told Moreni that due to various difficulties, the Export-Import Bank had to temporarily suspend consideration of this issue.</p>
<h3>Bevin-Sforza Joint Plan Rejected by the UN General Assembly; The Question of Former Italian Colonies Becomes More Complicated</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] The United Nations General Assembly rejected the Bevin-Sforza joint plan for dealing with former Italian African colonies on the morning of the 18th. Because the General Assembly failed to conclude its affairs in the night meeting, the General Assembly adjourned at 2:32 AM and is scheduled to hold a final extraordinary meeting at 3:00 PM (4:00 AM Shanghai time on the 19th) to try to resolve this complicated issue again.</p>
<p>The failure of the Bevin-Sforza plan has shattered the hope of Western countries that a solution to the former Italian colonial issue is currently possible. The Western countries' attempt to maintain their bases in important strategic areas of Africa through this plan has also been extinguished. The final vote was 14 votes for and 37 votes against, with 7 abstentions. However, this failure was decisive. The signs of the plan's failure were that the main clause dealing with Cyrenaica failed to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. The clause gave Italy the trusteeship of Cyrenaica, starting in 1951 and continuing until all of Libya (including Cyrenaica and Fezzan) gained independence in 1956. At the time of the vote, 33 voted in favor, 17 voted against, and 8 abstained. After this clause failed, 19 of the 20 Latin American countries that supported Italian trusteeship of the region carried out their threat to block the entire plan, and France also joined this group. This result caused the clauses of British trusteeship of Cyrenaica, French trusteeship of Fezzan, and the incorporation of Eritrea (excluding the west) into Abyssinia to fail, because these clauses all had to obtain a two-thirds majority in the chapter-by-chapter vote. The proposal for Italian trusteeship of Somaliland also failed to obtain a two-thirds majority. The failure of the main clause on Cyrenaica was due to the opposition of the Arab, Asian, and Soviet blocs. At the same time, the General Assembly defeated the Soviet Union's proposal for joint UN trusteeship of the three African colonies by an absolute majority, making Libya and Eritrea independent within five years and Somaliland independent within ten years. The General Assembly also rejected Iraq's proposal, which advocated joint UN trusteeship of Libya and Somaliland and the division of Eritrea between Abyssinia and Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Moral Aid Should Be Given to China</p>
<p>[United Press Seattle 18th Dispatch] Democratic Senator Magnuson stated here today that after returning to Washington next week, he will propose in the Senate the promotion of a Pacific Alliance, similar to the recently signed Atlantic Treaty.

<h3>Economic Commission for Europe: US and Soviet Union Engage in Verbal Warfare</h3>
<p>[Reuters Geneva 17th Dispatch] At the meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union continued to engage in verbal warfare. After the US representative accused the Soviet Union of exploiting Eastern European countries, the Soviet representative, Arutiunian, retorted today, accusing the US representative of completely using erroneous figures. He pointed out that last year, the Soviet Union's exports to Eastern Europe exceeded its imports from Eastern Europe by more than 20%. He also pointed out that the Marshall Plan intended to make Western Europe a new form of colony, preventing Western Europe from developing trade with Eastern Europe, while the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries were prepared to develop trade with the West on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. Representatives from the other nine Eastern European countries, following the Soviet representative, also refuted the accusations made by the US representative, Bohd, yesterday against the Soviet Union, saying that Bohd's words were for propaganda purposes. They also said that Eastern European countries had benefited greatly from the long-term assistance received from the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Pandit Reiterates Indian Policy in the United States</h3>
<p>Absolutely No Participation in Power Blocs</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 17th Dispatch] India's newly appointed Ambassador to the United States, Mrs. Pandit, held her first press conference today, clarifying India's foreign policy. According to reports, "India intends to maintain a non-participatory attitude in the ideological struggle between the Soviet Union and Western countries, and will absolutely not be involved in any power bloc. I believe that the Soviet Union and Western countries can coexist peacefully, but empty words are of no use; both sides must follow up with action." Mrs. Pandit also stated, "India's foreign policy has three major goals: (1) to strive for independence and freedom for oppressed nations; (2) to eliminate racial inequality; and (3) to promote world peace. Communism is not a threat to India, but it is extremely distasteful. India has a very good relationship with Britain and welcomes American investment even more. There is absolutely no danger for foreign investment in India. India is very dissatisfied with the policies previously pursued by the Netherlands in Indonesia and hopes that the Dutch government will fully implement the agreement recently concluded with the Indonesian Republican government."</p>

<h3>Greek Army Minister Embraces Resolution for Victory</h3>
<p>Expresses Confidence in Clearing Out Guerrillas Within the Year</p>
<p>[Reuters Athens 18th Dispatch] The Greek Army Minister, Canellopoulos, inspected northern Greece and gave a speech in Salonika today: It is expected that the government can achieve victory over the guerrillas within the year.

<h3>Syria-Israel Armistice Negotiations Suddenly Declared Stalled</h3>
<p>[Reuters Haifa 17th Dispatch] After seven weeks, the armistice agreement negotiations between Syria and Israel were declared to have been suspended indefinitely today, pending the submission of negotiation terms by former UN mediator Bunche.

<h3>US is Watching Southeast Asia: Dutch-Indonesian Armistice Problem is the Current Focus of Agreement; The Situation in China Greatly Impacts Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 17th Dispatch] Upcoming events will determine whether Indonesia and Southeast Asia are considered a gain or loss in the record of US Far Eastern policy. The reasons are the following three developments: (1) The Netherlands and the Indonesian Republic and the Indonesian Federation will hold a meeting in The Hague; (2) The continued progress of the Chinese Communists and their impact on overseas Chinese; (3) The US hopes to support a genuine nationalist movement that is not guided by the Communists. Another issue related to the Hague Conference is whether the Indonesian Republican Army will obey the ceasefire order when the political leaders of the Indonesian Republic agree to issue it when the government is moved back to Yogyakarta. Regarding the China issue and the nationalism issue, some people believe that regional agreements are not enough to solve the Pacific problem, but a nationalist movement without communist participation is enough to solve it. Observers believe that Indonesian President Sukarno and Prime Minister Hatta still hold sufficient power to make the army obey the ceasefire, so the Hague Conference has a good chance of success. If so, and Indonesia restores peace, and the Netherlands and the US provide assistance to Indonesian nationalism so that the Communists cannot seize Indonesian leadership, then the Dutch East Indies may become a non-Communist fortress in Southeast Asia. Siam and Malaya have a large number of overseas Chinese, and other countries in Southeast Asia also have many overseas Chinese. The British side has said that the rebellion in Malaya is completely led by overseas Chinese communist elements. Observers here also believe that the chances of the Vietnamese King Bao Dai, supported by France, gaining popular support in Vietnam are no better than those of the Communist leader Ho Chi Minh. It is said that the US currently believes that Southeast Asian countries are extremely unconcerned about each other's problems, so a regional alliance cannot be implemented. Many believe that the influence of communism is the least in Indonesia, so the US has the highest hopes for Indonesia.</p>

<h3>US Atomic Laboratory: Uranium Block Suddenly Disappears</h3>
<p>Believed to Have Fallen Into Soviet Hands</p>
<p>[United Press New York 17th Dispatch] The New York Daily News today published a Washington special dispatch saying that on February 14, three-quarters of a pound—235 "disappeared" from the Chicago Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission, and was largely stolen. This is the greatest threat to national security discovered in peacetime, because Uranium-235 is the head of the atomic bomb, used to explode it, and is one of the most closely guarded secrets of the United States. The report also said that three-quarters of a pound is enough for an experienced nuclear scientist to engage in large-scale experiments, thereby completing the structural details of the atomic bomb explosion part. These details are only known to a very small number of people so far. Counterintelligence personnel now believe that the missing uranium is in Soviet hands.</p>
<h3>Clay Returns to Washington from Germany</h3>
<p>Receives Great Official Welcome and Accepts Oak Leaf Medal</p>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington 17th Dispatch] General Clay has returned home to retire after a lifetime of outstanding service to the country. He received a hero's welcome. Clay returned to the United States from Germany. He served as the US military commander in Germany for four years and just left office on May 15. Officials immediately prepared to welcome him and hold ceremonies.</p>
<p>This four-star general, who has served in the military since 1918, was responsible for the US Army supply plan during World War II. His most outstanding achievement in Germany was the creation of the air force. After the Soviet Union implemented a land blockade, cutting off normal land supply routes, Berlin relied on air transport to obtain food, fuel, medicine, and other essential necessities for 328 days. Clay often tried to get rid of his current position so that he could retire, but the government did not grant his request because his position was important, until recently when he was allowed to resign. At a press conference, Clay told questioners that he would be very surprised if the Soviet Union re-imposed the Berlin blockade, because the Soviet Union could not ignore the adverse repercussions it would cause worldwide. The United States has made clear its intention to "continue our cooperation, support the Berlin airlift, support European reconstruction, and support the Western European security pact. These actions have gained the trust of Western Europe. The tense situation of two years ago no longer exists today." Clay attributed this to the people's attitude towards the United States' willingness to support the recovery of Western countries. Clay expressed his belief: "It would be unwise for us to withdraw our occupation forces at the present time or in the near future." He stressed: The withdrawal of occupation forces must be implemented after the situation in Europe has stabilized. A reporter requested a detailed discussion of the recently completed East German vote, where more than 1,300 voters voted against the list of candidates designated by the Soviet Union. Clay commented: "This kind of vote represents a very courageous action in any totalitarian country." Regarding the rumored meeting of East and West German politicians, Clay admitted that such meetings had been held several times. He reiterated that people in Soviet-controlled East Germany intended to persuade people in West Germany to reject the proposal to establish a West German government. But he also said: The failure of the East German people was obviously due to the actions taken by the parliamentary council, which voted for a completely democratic government procedure for West Germany. When Clay arrived at the National Airport and stepped off the plane, the honor guard composed of soldiers, airmen, sailors, and marines stood at attention and fired a salute to show respect. Secretary of Defense Johnson stepped forward to shake hands with Clay and welcome him, and expressed the American people's gratitude for "a job well done." In addition to Johnson, the high-ranking officials of the national military organization were also at the airport to welcome him. Thousands of private citizens also warmly welcomed Clay back to the country. General Clay and his wife drove from the airport to the White House, where they were immediately welcomed by the President and Mrs. Truman. In the White House garden, Truman presented the 52-year-old West Point graduate with a medal, to show his appreciation for his "outstanding service to the nation and humanity." Cabinet members, congressional leaders, military dignitaries, and the British and French ambassadors were all present to award Clay the Distinguished Service Medal with an Oak Leaf Cluster. Clay received this medal for the third time. The citation for the award stated that "in the past, he had outstanding achievements in helping to arm our country's troops, and later added new and indelible achievements to his past achievements because of his handling of the difficult work of the military government in Germany... The situation in Germany made his service indispensable, and he was only allowed to retire on May 15 of this year, because his work had reached a milestone after the constitution of West Germany was drafted. His mission was extremely complex and difficult, and the completion of this mission is something that the people of the country will always be proud of." Clay then went from the White House to the Capitol, and had the honor of addressing both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The gallery was packed. As this retired military officer walked through the central corridor of the House to the podium, the crowd stood up and cheered, and Clay gave an impromptu speech. He told the members of the House that the German people had "firmly committed themselves" to the establishment of a government that maintains the dignity of the individual human being. Clay said that the failure of the four-power control of Germany was "due to our discovery that one of the four countries has dual purposes." He did not hide that what he was referring to was the Soviet Union. It is said that the two purposes were: (1) to obtain the maximum amount of compensation; (2) to establish a government that is exclusively controlled or at least exploited by the police state. When speaking to the Senate, Clay denounced the Soviet Union for trying to obstruct European reconstruction and block Berlin. He also said that this was due to the Soviet Union's fear of the American plan to consolidate the free countries of Europe. It is said that the Western European countries' fear of possible Soviet aggression has been dispelled by the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Western countries have been trying to cooperate with the Soviet Union for two years to establish a democratic government for the whole of Germany. But "we have not reached a common position. Our purpose has not been achieved, but this setback may have created our greatest victory. We found that free countries must be supported to prevent the forces that threaten the democratic way of life from invading." The United States' launch of the European Recovery Program was the climax. The signing of the Atlantic Treaty eliminated Western Europe's fear of aggression. Clay will go to New York on the 19th to receive an official welcome. Then he plans to return to his hometown of Marietta, Georgia. Lieutenant General Huebner succeeded Clay as the Commander of the US Army in Germany. He will also serve as the US Military Governor until the United States appoints a civilian High Commissioner in accordance with the three-nation agreement on West Germany.</p>
<h3>Second Act of the Three-Team Football Tournament: Tung Wah vs. Tsing Pak Today; Starts at 4:30 PM at Yuet Yuen</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The second act of the three-team football invitational tournament will take place today at Yuet Yuen, with the Tung Wah Second Team meeting the Tsing Pak Team, starting at 4:30 PM. Tung Wah has not been seen for a long time, and fans have been yearning for it. This time, Tung Wah is making a comeback, adding a large number of powerful players in addition to the original veterans. In particular, the iron gate Ng Ki-cheung is stationed in the center back, and Tse Sek-chuen is assisting in defense, which will be a major obstacle for the Tsing Pak forwards. Whether they can overcome this danger depends on the performance of the Tsing Pak forwards. With the addition of the general Ko Sau-ching, Tung Wah has become even more powerful. As for Tsing Pak, the defender Ngam Sze-sham has decided to play, making the Tsing Pak lineup complete. Today's Tung Wah vs. Tsing Pak battle will undoubtedly be the most valuable and exciting battle of the season. The referee is Fong Wing-fu, the linesmen are Chan Fuk-bo and Tsui Kwok-leung. The ticket prices are divided into two types, 240,000,000 and 160,000,000, for the sake of popularization. In order to maintain order, only 10,000 tickets will be sold. Yuet Yuen will start selling at 10:00 AM today to prevent crowding. The Four Dimensions Boy Scouts will be on the scene to assist the military police in maintaining order. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Tsing Pak</p>
<p>Wong See-kit</p>
<p>Keung Yuen-chi Chin Cheong-wing Ngam Sze-sham Keung Man-ching</p>
<p>Cheung Yan-yee Mang Yee-leung Fuk Nai-tong</p>
<p>Kam Luk-sang Law Sau-fuk Lau Lung-hing Lau Tai-yan Ku Yee-sat Fei Chun-wah</p>

<p>Lee Yiu Ko Sau-ching Hon Lung-hoi Tsui Cho-kwok Ka Yau-leung Chan Ming-chit Chin Wan-chen Kwan Wing-sheung</p>
<p>In the first match against the Railway Team the other day, Tsing Pak was able to force a 3-3 draw under a declining trend, which proves its rich experience and composure in the face of danger, and its outstanding style as the alliance leader. In addition to Wong See-kit, Keung Man-ching, Mang Yee-leung, and Fuk Nai-tong in defense, Ngam Sze-sham, a representative of the World Games, will put on his jersey again and play as the left back, making it even more seamless and as safe as Mount Tai. The five tigers Law Sau-fuk, Kam Luk-sang, Ku Yee-sat, Lau Lung-hing, and Lau Tai-yan are unparalleled in their charge into battle, and with the addition of Fei Chun-wah, who has returned from Hong Kong to help, it is even more icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Tung Wah has been dormant for a long time. This time, Ka Yau-leung gathered the old troops, reorganized the team, and after two weeks of intensive training, they have regained their past glorious appearance. Goalkeeper Cheung Bong-lun, a national player, needs no introduction. Cheung Lam-kan, with the big saber, sits at the rear, and with the assistance of Tse Sek-chuen, it is even more powerful. On the center back line, in addition to Hon Nei-bo and Yu Hap-hing, Ng Ki-cheung has returned to his mother team to serve, presiding over the center back, forming the strongest camp, which can attack and defend, and is impeccable. The forwards Hon Lung-hoi, Chan Ming-chit, Lee Yiu, and Ka Yau-leung have been partners for many years and have a tacit understanding. Today, with the participation of Ko Sau-ching, it is even more complete. The entire elite of Tung Wah is dispatched, ready to decide the outcome with Tsing Pak. The battle between the two heroes will be fiery, which can be expected.</p>

<h3>Lianxing Table Tennis Overwhelms Qinglian: Three Group B Matches Continue Today</h3>
<p>In the fourth Table Tennis League, Lianxing from Group A faced Qinglian at the Jingfen ball room the day before yesterday. Among Lianxing's five players, Chen Xingquan, the chopper, performed the weakest. His chops were high but without spin, and his footwork was slow, making it difficult to stop Qinglian's captain Liu Baotai's fierce attacks. He suffered a straight-set defeat. Although Qinglian was short on manpower, their fighting spirit was strong. After Liu Baotai defeated Chen Xingquan, Liang Menghui bravely fought against Lianxing's main player Hu Yiping. The match was extremely hard-fought. Yiping lost the first game but relied on steady play to win the next two games, reversing the defeat into a victory. The other three Lianxing players, Wu Zuochang, Zhang Shandada, and Feng Hao, all put on excellent performances, easily defeating Qinglian's three players. As a result, Lianxing overwhelmingly defeated Qinglian 4-1, maintaining their record of three wins in three games. Currently, Huamei leads the Group A standings with five wins in five games. The defending champion Jingwu team has repeatedly requested postponements, so they have not yet shown their faces, which is a great concern for fans.

<p>In the final match, Huaguang played Sanxing. At the start of the game, Huaguang's attack was so fierce, unprecedented. After 16 minutes, Wu Qixiang took a free kick from over 30 yards out, and it went in like a cannonball. Huaguang continued their attack, and Zhu Jia Zheng scored a goal, making it 2-0 at halftime. After switching sides, Sanxing attacked fiercely. Xiao Ziwen sent the ball in front of the goal, and Zhang Jie headed it in, making it 1-2. Lin Dianyi crossed the ball, and Wu Binghao headed it in, tying the score at 2-2. In the last three minutes, Wu Binghao scored, turning the defeat into a victory for Sanxing at 3-2.

<h3>Jingwu Wrestling Group Begins Classes</h3>
<p>The Jingwu Wrestling Group of the Jingwu Athletic Association has seen a surge in enrollment from middle and high school students since the start of this year's recruitment. The original wrestling room of the group was no longer sufficient to meet the needs. In order to meet the practical needs, the wrestling room of the group's branch was dismantled, expanded, and renovated, and fundraising was immediately started to raise funds for the expansion and renovation. Because the group is the only organization in our country that soundly promotes wrestling, and its achievements are outstanding, it has attracted the attention of enthusiastic sports people in the community. Therefore, fundraising was completed in a few days. Yesterday, the wrestling room of the group was expanded and renovated, and it was brand new. The famous wrestling professor Zhou Shibin led a simple and solemn opening ceremony, and encouraged all members to repay the kindness of enthusiastic donors from all walks of life with their work and study achievements.</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Price to Be Posted Today: National Bank Announces Four Measures: Silver Dime Exchange at 12 Dimes per Dollar</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The Central Bank was ordered by the Garrison Authority yesterday to implement the posting of silver dollar prices starting today. The Central Bank yesterday specifically announced four measures related to the posting of silver dollar prices, ordering all relevant parties to implement them: (1) The Political Committee of the Garrison Headquarters in Jing, Hu, and Hang had previously decided that local banks should implement measures for distributing silver dollars to depositors. (That is, the proportion of silver dollars to be distributed will be determined by comparing the previous day's inventory and the number obtained from the National Bank on the current day with the outstanding deposit balance, and it will be announced for implementation.) Strict implementation will begin on the 19th. (2) The Central Bank will implement the posting of silver dollar prices starting on the 19th and will resume the distribution of silver dollars when depositors withdraw deposits from banks. (3) In order to facilitate the banks' distribution, the Central Bank will also distribute silver dimes in addition to silver dollars to the banks, with silver dimes calculated at 12 dimes per dollar. (4) The Political Committee decided that the method for banks to distribute silver dollars to depositors has not been followed by the banks. The reason is likely that the price of silver dollars has not been determined by the Central Bank. It is reported that if banks refuse to comply starting on the 19th, the Garrison Headquarters will severely punish them.</p>

<h3>Red Cross Donates Medicine: Relief for Baoshan Refugees</h3>
<p>There are currently over 1,700 refugees in Baoshan County, and the fellow-villagers association is trying to provide for them. Many of them are injured. Yesterday, the chairman of the fellow-villagers association, Zhu Hexiang, and the general secretary, Fan Xiaoyun, requested relief from the Shanghai Red Cross office. The office sent a large batch of medicines to help with their treatment.</p>
<h3>Selling Banknotes Leads to Fraud Charges: Two Defendants Each Sentenced to Fines</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Chen Mingliang and Zhu Wenbao both worked as banknote vendors. At 5:00 PM on March 17th of this year, near the Big Self-Ringing Clock in this city, a streetcar ticket seller, Wu Qingxiang, sold them seven silver dollars. As they were counting the banknotes, the streetcar suddenly started. Due to his work responsibilities, Wu asked them to wait a moment and left. Chen and Zhu then temporarily conspired to defraud him of the 28,000 yuan that was due, taking it for themselves. Before long, Wu returned to the original place and did not see them. Only then did he realize he had been cheated. The next day, he ran into them at the original place and took them to the police局, which transferred them to the prosecutor for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday, the district court sentenced each of them to a fine of 50 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Agrees to Allocate 1 Million Pounds: To Purchase 22,000 Long Tons of Rice: Yang Chuo'an Returns to Shanghai After Negotiating in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Mr. Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee, left Shanghai for Guangzhou to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance to expedite the allocation of funds and increase purchases to replenish the city's food supply. He returned to Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 17th. Yesterday, Mr. Yang told reporters: The Ministry of Finance has agreed to allocate 1 million pounds in foreign exchange for the purchase of 22,000 long tons of rice from Southeast Asia. The funds can be allocated to the Central Trust Bureau for purchase and transportation to Shanghai. In addition, the Ministry of Finance previously agreed to allocate the equivalent of 600,000 silver dollars for grain funds. In addition to the portion already paid by the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance also agreed to allocate the remaining amount. Mr. Yang will negotiate with the Political Committee of the Garrison Headquarters in the coming days to continue the allocation and try to purchase more grain. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has decided to allocate a corresponding amount of the flour stored by the China Trust Bureau in Shanghai for distribution. If transportation is unimpeded, the city's grain supply will be abundant, and there will be no need to worry about the food supply. Mr. Yang also said that he had met with the Finance Minister in Guangzhou again, and the authorities are considering a successor.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the General Labor Union Petition Again: Please Approve the Silver Dollar Price Immediately</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] In view of the abolition of the index-linked wage method and the change to the silver dollar-based wage method, the municipal General Labor Union noted that due to the National Bank's failure to approve the silver dollar price and the skyrocketing black market price of silver dollars, labor and management were unable to comply, leading to repeated disputes and greatly affecting social order. The ninth meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the association recently resolved to appoint standing directors and supervisors Fang Rusheng, Sun Jinghu, and five others to visit Director Chen of the Bureau in person after the meeting to seek remedial measures, but there was no result. Disputes caused by salary payments at various factories continued to arise. Yesterday (the 18th), the association again sent Fang Rusheng, Ye Xianggao, and others to visit Director Chen Baotai, requesting that he quickly forward the request to the National Bank to approve the silver dollar price for the purpose of paying wages. Otherwise, he should request the management to directly issue silver dollars in accordance with Article 3 of the regulations to resolve the disputes.</p>
<p>(Another report) In view of the fact that the city has entered a state of war and the military authorities have made complete preparations for the defense of the suburbs, and that this city is the industrial center of the country with numerous factories, the General Labor Union believes that all workers should remember that factories are national production fortresses and the place where workers live. If petty criminals or robbers and traitors take the opportunity to sabotage, they must use the power of their organization to strike. Yesterday, the association issued a notice to all 560 labor unions under its jurisdiction in the city, urging them to earnestly assist the public security authorities to ensure the safety of factories and maintain production order. They should also quickly follow the advice of the authorities and mobilize the organization of self-defense teams to cooperate with wartime work and stabilize the local area.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Atmosphere Changes Greatly: Citizens Automatically Conserve: Few People Inquire About Expensive Vegetables, Silk, and Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Since the magnificent Battle of Shanghai began in the suburbs, the social order in the city has become more disciplined. The legendary life that used to permeate everywhere has completely disappeared. The speculative market is unprecedentedly deserted, and prices are relatively stable. The large houses and mansions in the western district are locked up all day long. The congestion of telephones and vehicles in the office area before noon has been greatly improved. All schools, large companies, and commercial storefronts have added protective wooden boards to their glass windows. Ordinary households are also rushing to install fences or barbed wire at the walls and alley entrances. Around 9:00 PM, pedestrians on the street hurry home, and the rich and powerful who squander money in entertainment venues are extremely rare. Under a wartime atmosphere, the extravagant and dissolute Shanghai style that has persisted for more than a century has clearly bid farewell to the "Ten-Mile Foreign Concession."</p>
<p>In terms of the daily life of ordinary citizens, most families have now automatically developed thrifty habits. According to surveys conducted by reporters at various small vegetable markets in recent days, the consumption of fish, meat, seafood, and other more expensive vegetables has decreased significantly, while the sales of pickled vegetables and salted fish tofu have been very good. A large number of fashion stores on the central section of Avenue Joffre, such as Jinlan, Kangle, Yamei, Lvxia, Fuxing, and Guohua, have almost all dismantled their large display windows. The clerks are shouting themselves hoarse, yelling on the display stands that silk and woolen fabrics are being sold at a 70% discount, just like a used clothing auction on the stone road, and the price is even cheaper. However, very few people inquire. Most citizens are currently not interested in clothing, and the sales of summer-appropriate white leather shoes, handbags, and other accessories this year have been bleak. Most of the Western-style clothing industry has not seen a customer visit in the past two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Theater Box Office Sales Dismal: Drama Is Expected to Rise</p>
<p>The movie industry is also in an unprecedented slump. Due to poor box office sales, the Western film market is currently only circulating old copies. Old movies such as "Bathing Beauty" and "The Gunfighter" are still frequently screened in first-run theaters. Domestic film producers have stopped production because the heads of various factories have mostly left Shanghai for Hong Kong. New movies cannot be made, and a large number of "stars," such as Shi Hui and Zhang Fa, have formed drama troupes to perform dramas at the Lyceum Theatre. It is expected that drama will rise again in this city for a period of time.</p>
<p>As for Peking opera performances, they are no longer as brilliant as in the past. A large number of leading actors have not appeared for a long time, and theaters are trying their best to attract audiences with half-price tickets, but they stop the show and close the curtains at 8:00 PM every night, which is quite disappointing. Cheng Xiaofei and Cheng Xiaoting, who are famous for performing comic dialogues, have recently seen a sharp decline in their income due to a sharp reduction in private performances. They have jointly established a consignment store and are accepting introductions of goods for sale to businesses and users on the radio. They rely on extracting commissions for their living.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Black Market Prices Higher: Nickel Coin Trading Active</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Yesterday's silver dollar market was at a standstill because the central bank had not yet posted prices, and businesses could not operate. The number of "silver bulls" on the streets is increasing day by day, and underground transactions are becoming more active. The black market price is rising higher and higher. In the afternoon, it was heard that it had risen to above the "flat head" U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The silver coin market is becoming more active. Due to the rising gold banknotes, people are collecting them out of curiosity, and the market is quite prosperous. 20-cent coins rose from 300,000 to 400,000, and in the afternoon rose to 350,000 to 450,000. 10-cent coins rose from 120,000 to 170,000 to 150,000 to 200,000. 5-cent coin transactions were rare, with buying at 70,000 and selling at 100,000, an increase of about 30% compared to the previous day. Silver dime trading also turned active, with buying at 900,000 and selling at 1 million.</p>
<p>The gold-silver exchange rate narrowed by another 2 yuan. The morning price was 45.48, and the afternoon price was as low as 44.47. One type of currency moved slightly to 43.46, two types of currency traded at 45.48, and miscellaneous foreign currency traded as low as 48.53.</p>
<p>The gold-banknote exchange rate also narrowed by 2 yuan, from 52 yuan to 54 yuan, to as low as 50 yuan to 53 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The banknote-silver exchange rate narrowed by another 5 to 7 cents. In the morning, one type of currency traded at 8.5 yuan to 9 yuan, and in the afternoon it was as low as 8.3 yuan to 8.8 yuan. Paired currency also traded at 9 yuan to 9.5 yuan, and as low as 8.5 yuan to 9 yuan. Two types of currency also fell to 8.8 yuan to 9.3 yuan. Miscellaneous foreign currency initially traded at 9.5 yuan to 10 yuan, and then slightly fell to 9.3 yuan to 9.8 yuan.</p>
<p>For gold ornaments exchanged for silver dollars, shops still posted prices of 48 yuan to 50 yuan, while factory bars were an additional 2 yuan, for 50 yuan to 55 yuan.</p>
<h3>No Rice Arriving at Market; Prices Continue to Soar; Limited Trade in Coarse Grains and Flour; Edible Oil Finally Declines Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rice: Due to the continued rise in gold and silver prices outside the market, rice prices have continued to climb, resulting in increasingly sluggish trading. Northern Market’s Superior White Rice and Thin-Husked Indica Rice both reached an exorbitant 74 million yuan, a staggering increase of 16 million yuan from the previous day. In the Southern Rice Market, Superior White Rice was priced at 72 million yuan and Thin-Husked Rice at 73 million yuan, increases of 12 to 13 million yuan from the previous day. Other varieties were offered in smaller quantities, and neither market received any new arrivals yesterday. Retail prices for Superior White Rice have reached as high as 110 million yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains: Trading slowed yesterday, with only scattered transactions within the street. Prices also rose due to the increase in gold and silver. Shuangyuan soybeans traded at 33 million yuan, up 2 million yuan; Zhangbaling corn at 8.8 million yuan; and Jiujiang sesame at 44 million yuan, with slight volume. Raw peanuts from Linhuaiguan were priced at 63.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Flour: Prices were initially firm, then weakened. The opening prices were far from the gold and paper money exchange rate. Sellers tried hard to close the gap, leading to high asking prices and sluggish trading. "Warship" brand opened at 14.85 million yuan and closed in the afternoon at 14.3 million yuan, still an increase of over 20% compared to the previous day. "Old Car" brand was priced at 16.5 million yuan and "Dafa" at 15.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Oil Market: After consecutive days of surging prices, retail investors stopped buying at high levels, leaving the market very weak. Prices fell slightly yesterday. Factory soybean oil opened in the morning still above 200 million yuan but retreated to 187 million yuan in the afternoon, with some transactions. Raw oil declined slightly, with factory raw oil priced at 198 million yuan. Raw vegetable oil was scarce, with prices rising initially in the morning market but retreating by the afternoon, closing at 165 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Under the Shadow of Widespread Buying Interest, the Gold Market Boils with Rising Prices; Gold Shops Suspend Quotations Again</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The gold market continued its upward trend yesterday. With cash from other locations flowing back and Central Bank loans being issued in large quantities, ample speculative capital flooded the gold and paper money markets. Under the shadow of widespread buying interest, trading became increasingly chaotic. The market once again reached its daily limit, with quoted prices as high as 5.5296 billion yuan, but there was no supply to meet the demand, and trading remained suspended. Outside the market, prices surged unstoppably, opening at 5.5 billion and 5.8 billion yuan in the morning, and approaching the 6 billion yuan mark. Afternoon prices soared to 5.8 billion and 6.1 billion yuan. Near midday, the Central Bank commissioned Dadecheng to sell gold at 5.8 billion yuan without limitation, selling a total of 380 large bars. In the afternoon, with people's spirits high and the price increases seemingly endless, the price once exceeded the 6 billion yuan mark, reaching as high as 6.2 billion and 6.5 billion yuan, ultimately closing at 6 billion and 6.3 billion yuan. The Central Bank continued to sell gold at 6 billion and 5.8 billion yuan, but only for transactions between banks, resulting in no takers. Consequently, the price jumped another 900 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The rise in the U.S. dollar outside the market was slightly less pronounced, opening at 10.5 million and 11.5 million yuan in the morning, and rising to 11.3 million and 11.8 million yuan at the midday close. In the afternoon, demand exceeded supply, with prices reaching as high as 12 million and 12.5 million yuan, ultimately closing at 11.5 million and 12 million yuan, an increase of 1.8 million yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Due to the drastic fluctuations in gold prices, making it impossible to balance supply and demand, gold shops have once again suspended price quotations after only recently reopening.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Continue Towards New Heights</h3>
<p>[Report from China United News Agency] In the cotton yarn market, financial goods outside the market are showing a strong upward trend, and people are anticipating further increases, and the market is still actively buying, market prices continue toward new heights. 42-count "Blue Phoenix" reached 1.89 billion yuan, 32-count "Silver Moon" 1.45 billion yuan, 21-count "Double Horse" 1.16 billion yuan, 20-count "Tiannu" 1.16 billion yuan, and 16-count "Guangming" 920 million yuan.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, prices continued to rise towards new heights yesterday. While nominally stable, the increases are similar to those of goods outside the market. "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at 17.6 million yuan and closed at 18.4 million yuan in the afternoon, while "Four Gentlemen" serge opened at 18 million yuan and closed at 17.8 million yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>National Bank Allocates 5,000 Bales of Yarn in Exchange for 50,000 Tons of Taiwanese Coal to Alleviate Coal Panic in the City</h3>
<p>[Report from Huadong News Agency] According to a responsible official at the National Bank, the bank has purchased a total of 5,000 bales of cotton yarn from private yarn factories, which will be shipped to Taiwan in exchange for Taiwanese coal to alleviate the coal shortage in Shanghai. Each bale of yarn will be exchanged for ten tons of coal, for a total of 50,000 tons.

<h3>Unit Stamps Eagerly Sought After, Over 80 Billion Yuan Worth Mostly Sold</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to the post office, since the issuance of unit stamps on the 16th, because they are not affected by devaluation and can be purchased in large quantities and used at any time, companies, firms, and organizations with a large volume of daily mail have rushed to purchase them. As of yesterday morning, over 211,000 stamps have been issued, valued at over 80 billion Gold Yuan, and most have already been sold. However, the post office urges the public to note that, in addition to ordinary letters, airmail, registered mail, and express mail require a unit stamp for that category of mail, plus one ordinary letter unit stamp, to be properly mailed.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to the post office, land routes for communication between the city and other areas have been completely cut off. Water transport is subject to delays due to the scarcity of ships. Postal transport relies entirely on airmail. The public is urged to use airmail as much as possible for safe and rapid delivery. The Postal Administration accepts outgoing mail until 8 PM each night, but internal processing takes time, so the public is urged to submit mail early.</p>
<h3>Arson Motivated by Resentment Over Rental Dispute; Husband and Wife Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Ding Zhijun and his wife, Ding Wang Xiuying, previously rented half a shop at 86 Ren'an Street from Xu Quanshou to operate a tailor shop. Subsequently, they were involved in a lawsuit with Xu over a housing dispute, and the court ordered them to vacate the premises by March 7 of this year. Ding harbored malicious intentions and moved his apprentice and furniture out on the afternoon of March 4. Ding and his wife then returned to stay overnight. The next morning, taking advantage of the neighbors being asleep, they set fire to the house by placing combustible materials under the bamboo floorboards and fled. Xu and his wife, sleeping upstairs, smelled smoke and fire and discovered the fire downstairs. They hurriedly put on clothes and fled. Xu then risked entering the house to salvage belongings, but the fire was too intense, and as he turned to flee, the door frame collapsed, crushing Xu and burning him to death. Police investigation determined that Ding and his wife were highly suspected and, after many efforts, arrested them and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday, the District Court sentenced each of them to seven years in prison.</p>

<h3>"Refugees" in Hong Kong Reach Saturation Point!</h3>
<p>— Qing Yun</p>
<p>With war raging across the motherland, Hong Kong has become a haven for the wealthy. The situation is strikingly similar to the early days of the Second Sino-Japanese War twelve years ago.</p>
<p>Following the abandonment of Nanjing and the push towards Shanghai, as the defense of the city looms, Shanghai's wealthy are desperately fleeing, even if it means bearing the unpleasant label of "refugee." Their destination is Hong Kong, once considered a paradise before the war. The roar of aircraft fills the skies above the small island, with civil aviation planes weaving through the air without pause, constantly disturbing the nerves of Hong Kong's three million residents. From the first light of dawn until late at night, and then into another early morning, the noise never stops. The once desolate and quiet Kai Tak Airport has become a bustling city.</p>
<p>However, despite the influx of refugees, there is little evidence of poverty. They are dressed in the latest and most elaborate fashions, adorned with precious jewelry. Their luggage is piled high, like small hills, and they wear smiling faces and have well-nourished complexions. It hardly seems fitting to call them "refugees."</p>
<p>With Hong Kong's population already saturated, the addition of so many "high-class refugees" makes the housing problem even more acute. Unless you have a well-connected friend, you can forget about finding a room in a hotel. As a result, construction is booming throughout the city, with projects being completed at a pace never before seen in Hong Kong's history.</p>
<p>The arrival of the "refugees" has led to a surge in food prices. Combined with the lean season between harvests and a reduction in rice shipments from the mainland, this has further driven up the price of rice. Xue rice has risen to fifty-four or five yuan per unit, and the prices of other commodities such as firewood, charcoal, cooking oil, and vegetables are also rising steadily.</p>
<p>Gold Rush</p>
<p>Like a bolt from the blue, the Hong Kong government suddenly announced a ban on the buying and selling of gold and private ownership of it in mid-April, to take effect immediately. This plunged Hong Kong into turmoil, shaking the city. The financial market was thrown into chaos, with people scrambling to respond. Gold shops closed their doors. However, the gold rush subsided within a few days. It became known that the Hong Kong government had unspoken reasons for issuing the ban.</p>
<p>Britain is a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF accused the Hong Kong government of being a major center for gold smuggling and that gold prices were far exceeding IMF regulations. Under this pressure, the Hong Kong government issued the ban to, "on the surface" at least, fulfill its obligations as a member. However, this was merely a formality, as enforcement was another matter. As the Financial Secretary said, "The government has no intention of interfering if residents use gold to build houses or airplanes."</p>
<p>Currently, gold futures and spot sales are flourishing, with prices even higher than before the ban. However, the consequence of this gold rush is the devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
<p>Summer Scene</p>
<p>The weather in the South is always a little ahead of other places. Although it is still late spring, it already feels like summer in Hong Kong. It is not that Hong Kong people are prescient, but rather that the weather is too hot, and people have already changed their wardrobes. The once dormant beaches have revived. Repulse Bay and the waters off North Point are crowded with people on holidays. Department stores are filled with swimwear, still in the same bright red and green floral patterns, with styles that have not changed much from previous years. Women's styles are still just a pair of bra cups and a pair of bikini bottoms. Recently, new swimming aids have arrived, including webbed gloves and fins. The gloves are shaped like duck feet, while the fins resemble fish tails. There are also rubber goggles, which were not seen last year. These are likely new products, with surprisingly high prices.</p>
<p>Colorful Hawaiian shirts have been abandoned this year, replaced by maroon Hawaiian shirts paired with gray or colorless trousers and black and white two-toned leather shoes, transforming the youth of Hong Kong into "pathetic green youths." Indian silk shops have been busy moving goods for days. Fabrics for women's clothing are flooding in, keeping the young ladies busy and the gentlemen exasperated!</p>
<p>Dance halls have entered a quiet period and do not feel particularly lively. The same is true for cinemas, which are not showing any blockbuster movies. Film companies are planning their autumn offensive after the weather cools down.</p>
<h3>Prices Under the Fire of War</h3>
<p>(Special report from this Newspaper) The rapid rise in prices during wartime is an inevitable phenomenon. However, the extent of this rise varies. Some prices increase dramatically, while others increase only slightly. Generally speaking, the prices of food, fuel, and daily necessities will rise sharply, while the prices of expensive clothing and luxury goods will rise far less. This has been the case in all previous wars in Shanghai. For example, after the start of the August 13 Incident in 1937, the price of rice in Shanghai rose from 1.16 yuan per斗(dou) on August 1 to 1.50 yuan per 斗(dou) on August 15. Coal balls rose even more dramatically, from 1.35 yuan per担(dan) on August 1 to 2 yuan per 担(dan) on August 15, and then to 3 yuan per 担(dan) on September 1. Given the stability of prices and currency values at the time, such a rapid price increase was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Rise</p>
<p>The rise in prices under the threat of war is due to a variety of factors. In summary, these include: First, the massive military spending leads to rapid currency inflation and a decline in currency value. Second, general public panic and instability lead to the scramble for essential supplies, especially food and fuel. Third, speculators hoard and monopolize goods, creating chaos for their own profit. Fourth, some farmland is turned into battlefields, and factories cannot produce goods, creating supply problems. Fifth, external transportation is disrupted, the exchange of goods is lost, many unnecessary goods cannot be transported out, and the supply of necessary goods is reduced, causing the price to rise and fall.</p>
<p>August 13th Precedent</p>
<p>Let's take the example of the August 13 Incident in 1937. According to statistics, food prices increased by 10.28% from August to October, fuel prices increased by 33.72%, while clothing prices actually decreased by 1.12%. This shows that during wartime, people can only focus on maintaining basic sustenance, with little time to care about clothing.</p>
<p>Fuel Takes the Lead</p>
<p>After the war approached Shanghai this time, according to unofficial statistics, food and fuel prices rose the most, with fuel prices leading the way. This is also due to natural causes. Regarding food, the city has ample reserves, and transporting it back home is relatively convenient. However, fuel is the main issue, and coal is bulky and heavy and must be transported from afar, making the supply far less convenient than food, so prices have risen the most.</p>
<p>Salted Fish and Fences</p>
<p>The rise in prices of some items is very abnormal. According to people familiar with the business community, the rise in the prices of several items in the last half month has far exceeded that of food and fuel. One is salted yellow croaker. Recently, dried salted yellow croaker can be seen everywhere on the streets of Shanghai, or on balconies facing the street. Almost every household has several pounds, and the total sales volume is considerable. A month ago, in the Sixteenth Shop area, the center of the salted fish industry, one silver dollar could buy more than 20 pounds. Later, at the most expensive time, it could only buy five pounds. Now the price has fallen again. On the other hand, salted pork and ham are not selling well. The situation of lining up in front of ham shops early in the morning and being limited to one pound per person at the time of price controls has not been seen again. This is because they are too expensive. Although they can be stored, people cannot afford to eat them. Therefore, they are far less popular with the petty bourgeoisie than salted yellow croaker. Secondly, ropes have risen incredibly. This is because the military needs ropes for construction, and people who are preparing for emergencies and escaping also need ropes. Therefore, although this item cannot be eaten, it has become a target for speculation by some merchants, and the price has risen sharply. Another item is timber. Just look at the clanging of hammers as people rush to install fences and gates in various alleys, and you can imagine what is happening.</p>
<p>No One Asks</p>
<p>In addition to new cars and expensive radios, imported Western suits are also among the least sought-after items. These were the objects that people rushed to buy when price controls were first lifted last year. How quickly they have been neglected! Now, there are stalls lining the streets, and many of them are selling expensive clothing materials. These are the goods that employees of the large shops which have very little business have been forced to move to the roadside to sell. A set of clothing material often sells for only six or seven silver dollars, which is equivalent to half a 担(dan) of rice before the war. The prices are cheap, but there are not many buyers, because the problem of food is too important. With an uncertain future, and unknown how to make a living, the idea of making a new suit is naturally dismissed.</p>
<p>The Silver Dollar Problem</p>
<p>If calculated in silver dollars, the current prices are not high. For example, rice cost 12 yuan before the war. Other things are of course unnecessary to mention. Before the war, a Western meal in the central district cost 1.23 yuan, while in the western district it cost 1.67 yuan. But now the general price of a Western meal, converted into silver dollars, is only 70 or 80 cents. But the problem is: how many silver dollars can people earn in a month? An ordinary public education employee earns about five yuan. An employee in a production department who can earn 20 silver dollars a month is doing well. Before the war, an elementary school teacher could earn 40 or 50 yuan, and it was not uncommon to earn a hundred yuan a month. Compared to that, the value of one silver dollar today has risen many times over. Spending it is naturally a serious matter.</p>

<h3>Unable to Afford Medical Treatment, Life is in the Balance</h3>
<p>A Reader Appeals for Help from Philanthropists</p>
<p>To the Editor: I venture to implore you to disclose my unfortunate circumstances in a corner of your newspaper.</p>
<p>I am a servant at the Mei Ya Photo Studio, living in a small room on the second floor of 106 Kaifeng Road in this city. Every month, I bring home all of my salary to support my elderly mother and young daughter. Last year, I developed a malignant tumor in my abdomen, which has been gradually enlarging and causing excruciating pain. Because I have no savings, I cannot afford medical treatment. However, as the illness has worsened, at the beginning of this month, I had to ask for leave to seek medical help and borrowed more than ten silver dollars from relatives and neighbors for medical expenses. I am now staying in Room 77 on the third floor of Zhongshan Hospital.</p>
<p>The doctor told me that my illness cannot be cured with just a few days in the hospital. I need surgery, and because my blood is depleted, I need a blood transfusion before the surgery. This blood transfusion alone costs 50 silver dollars. Alas! How can someone like me, who lives hand to mouth, come up with such a huge sum of money? Moreover, the daily hospital fee is 1.2 yuan. I have asked the hospital authorities to reduce the fee, but I have been disappointed.</p>
<p>If I do not treat my illness, the doctor says that I have at most two months left to live. Alas! My death is not a pity, but how will my elderly mother and young daughter, who depend on me for survival, live in the future? Therefore, with nowhere else to turn, I still want to fight for my last breath, struggling to implore you to disclose my plight and appeal to philanthropists for sympathy and assistance. I also hope that you can ask the Zhongshan Hospital authorities to make an exception and reduce the various fees so that a dying person can have hope for life. If the lives of my family of three can be saved, then all the kind people and you, sir, I will honor in life and remember with gratitude in death. Respectfully wishing you peace.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cui Jieguang (Patient)</p>

<h3>Legal Clarifications</h3>
<p>Answered primarily by Attorney Tang Mingshi</p>
<p>[Question from Mr. Cheng Xiaotian] (1) In a marital quarrel, if the wife takes flight with the husband's real estate deeds, can the husband file a lawsuit with the local court? (2) If both parties engage in mutual wrestling, resulting in injuries, can one spouse sue the other for the crime of physical assault? (3) If a marital relationship is strained and, at the wife's request and with relatives present, the husband provides a certain amount of grain for sustenance, can the wife then sue the husband for abandonment?</p>
<p>[Answer] (1) If the couple does not divide their property, then the couple's property is jointly owned. Therefore, the chapter on theft in the Criminal Law includes a provision exempting spouses from punishment (Article 324 of the Criminal Law). (2) The crime of spousal assault can be established, but minor cases are not prosecuted unless reported. (3) Since sustenance grain has been provided, there is no act of abandonment; however, whether the alimony provided is sufficient for sustenance must be determined based on local living conditions and the family's financial situation.</p>
<h3>Diplomas Gone Without a Trace, Earnestly Seeking Return</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: I am a student at National Wusong Merchant Marine College, having graduated from St. John's High School during the enemy-puppet regime. Last summer, I received a notice from the college to submit a high school diploma that had been inspected and stamped by the Bureau of Education for submission to the Ministry of Education for verification. From last summer to this spring, I made countless trips before finally receiving the diploma. Unexpectedly, on the 29th of last month, while having lunch in the dining hall of the maritime college, the diploma I had placed in my raincoat pocket vanished in the blink of an eye. I have searched for several days without success and am extremely anxious. Although the diploma is of no concern to outsiders, it is of utmost importance to me personally. Therefore, I earnestly request that you kindly publish this notice. If any kind person finds the diploma (diploma number is Yue Bu Zi No. 2), I hope they will return it. I will be eternally grateful. Please accept my best wishes. Respectfully submitted, Reader Li Qien. May 10th. Correspondence address: c/o Xu Residence, No. 19, Lane 520, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>"Land Limitation" in Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liang Yushan</p>
<p>[Guilin Dispatch] At present, the land policy of land limitation and rent reduction has become a national urgency. The Guangxi Provincial authorities, from last year to this year, have made the realization of "land to the tiller" one of the most important county government policies.</p>
<p>Looking at the land distribution situation in this province, although large landlords may be fewer compared to other provinces, in relative terms, the phenomenon of "the rich owning fields stretching for miles, while the poor have no place to stand" is evident. In the areas along the major rivers, such as Rongxian, Guiping, and Pingnan counties, there are wealthy families with annual rents of 9,000 dan, and many others with 7,000 to 8,000 dan or around 1,000 dan; in Guixian and Yulin areas, there are large landlords who do not even know how much grain they have accumulated. Due to the landlords' cunning manipulation and the ineffective implementation by those in charge of land administration, the work faces numerous difficulties.</p>
<p>The general situation is as follows: (1) "Land" and "tax" are disconnected, making contract renewal difficult to implement. The implementation of the land limitation policy must first involve land surveying, but previous land declarations in the localities were poorly handled, leading to chaotic tax administration. As a result, one does not know what their tax is, nor does one family know how many mu of land they own. "Land" and "tax" are thus disconnected, making land sales difficult, and contract renewal cannot be negotiated. (2) Landlords and wealthy gentry manipulate local power, making rent reduction and land limitation very difficult to handle. This year, after the province implemented land limitation, landlords saw the opportunity to cause trouble, trying to evade the policy by dividing households and occupying land, breaking large holdings into smaller ones. Rent reduction is even more difficult to implement, mainly because there are too many tenant farmers competing to cultivate the land. The land limitation work is treated as mere formality, with many places simply posting a notice to that effect. (3) No one wants to buy the landlords' land. In areas with harmonious landlord-tenant relations, such as Zhaoping and Mengshan, landlords are often willing to sell excess land, but tenant farmers, either due to poverty or hesitation, are unwilling to buy at the price. In addition, some landlords raise land prices, hindering the progress of the land limitation policy.</p>
<p>On the government side: local implementation is weak, land surveying contains errors and corruption, and the work of organizing land and household registers is yet to be reviewed. All of this leads to numerous obstacles in the preparatory work for land limitation.</p>
<p>In general, the vast majority of senators unanimously and firmly stated: "We believe that the most important thing in implementing land limitation is to organize tenant farmers and poor peasants, making them the driving force behind land reform. At the same time, the government must have the courage and determination to offend the wealthy and powerful families, consistently carry out the policy, and then land reform will not be an empty promise." They also believe that the government should strictly enforce the policy and that public officials should set an example and take the lead. The majority of senators are eager to see land limitation realized. The senators come from the people, and these are the opinions of the people. The will of the people is where government should take advantage of this opportunity, address the actual difficulties, make bold reforms, and achieve success. The people hope for this realization, and the country needs this realization.</p>
<p>Why is the tea from the high mountains so good? Because when the tender leaves first emerge in the spring, the tea farmers do not pick them all, and the small buds that sprout again (called mother-and-child tea) are not picked for fear of harming the tree. In winter, the withered grass around the roots of the tea tree is turned over, and then in the following spring, when the weather is warm, it sprouts new buds. Because the mountains are high and the climate is cold, the production is later than in the plains.</p>
<p>Two Tests</p>
<p>If readers want to test the quality of tea leaves, here are two good methods: Take a clean porcelain bowl, put a small amount of tea leaves in the bowl, and brew with boiling water. After a short while, the leaves will open up, and the robust ones will float on the surface like whales swimming in the water. If you look closely, there are insect holes, shaped like small commas, that have not been eaten through, then the leaves are the best; because tea leaves from high mountains contain sweet juice, it is inevitable that there will be parasites. Since there is sweet juice, insects will not fail to eat it. The mountains are high and the soil is fertile, and the tea leaves grow thick, so in the short period of time it takes for the tea leaves to come down the mountain, the insects do not have the strength to eat through a hole. This is what makes good tea leaves. Second, there is a very simple test method: take a brewed tea leaf, pick it up, and gently tear it apart by hand. If many fine strands like lotus roots appear when the leaf breaks, then that tea is also very good.</p>
