<h3>杜錢門宣布馬歇爾准辭　艾契遜繼任國務卿　並聲明對蘇政策不軟化</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約七日廣播，華盛頓訊：國務卿馬歇爾因腎部施行手術後，體力不支，請求辭職，業經杜魯門總統批准，並委任艾契遜爲國務鄉。馬歇爾將於杜魯門新任期開始之一月廿日去職。杜魯門於宣布馬歇爾辭職之消息時，強調美國外交政策並不因而變更，美國之外交政策仍爲對蘇採取堅決態度，而支持聯合國機構。社魯門特別聲明，對蘇政策絕未軟化。新國務鄉艾契遜今年五十五歲，儀表修偉，曾任副國務卿多年，於馬歇爾任國務卿六個月後辭職。</p>
<p>艾契遜於一九四七年六月辭職後，在華府恢復律師職務。與馬歇爾同時辭職者爲副國卿羅維特，羅氏係於艾契遜辭職後繼任副卿。杜魯門稱：曾在白宮担任參事官多年之預算局局長魏勃，將繼任副國務卿，遺缺由現任預算局副局長法蘭克遞補。此次馬歇爾因體力不繼而被迫辭職，將使自一九四七年一月二十一日馬歇爾勉強就任國務卿時開始之美國外交政策大決策時代從此吿終，而馬歇爾經歷兩次世界大戰之一生光榮事業，亦同時結束。渠以參謀總長之資格，曾領導全國陸軍，從事歷史上最大之戰爭。</p>
<p>總統譽馬歇爾爲「美國最偉大的軍人」，並表示此次准其辭職，實屬萬不得已，「極表遺憾」。杜魯門吿記者稱：渠認馬歇爾爲第二次大戰期中之特出人物，渠初意並以爲馬歇爾必可康復，照常供職。此次新國務卿之任命，尚有待於參院之批准，但艾契遜人望素孚，而本屆議會中又係民主黨得勢，故批准必無問題。參院外交委員會委員湯麥斯與葛林等獲悉此訊後，已盛加贊譽。</p>
<p>艾契遜頃發表談話稱：此次受命，極爲意外，事前總統亦未與接洽。並謂，深感責任重大，定當戮力以赴。國務院內部，不擬有所更張。對總統之委魏勃爲其助手，表示「興奮」。</p>
<p>杜魯門稱：馬歇爾係於一月三日請辭，余雖望其痊愈供職，但不願強留渠而致損害其健康。杜魯門極力否認「福萊斯特·馬歇爾·羅維特外交政策」與杜魯門政策有任何不同之點，並謂，政策向係渠本人擬訂，而由馬歇爾忠實執行者。至羅維特之辭職，總統謂係由於「個人理由」。總統盛譽羅氏在副國務卿任內之政績。</p>

<h3>聯合國秘書長正式宣布　不干涉中國戰事　認爲採取行動無助於目前局勢</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖六日電〕聯合國秘書長賴伊六日宣稱，渠已決定不干涉中國戰事。據正式宣布：賴氏對此事曾「仔細考慮」，看不出「在渠一方面之任何行動會有助於目前情勢」。聯合國將否干涉中國戰事之問題，係於賴氏由巴黎聯大會議返此後，在五日之第一次記者招待會中听提起者，渠當時曾謂，渠將「考慮」聯合國是否能有所爲以制止國共戰事。聯合國六日宣稱：「秘書長對此一問題曾仔細考慮，渠認爲渠採取任何行動之權力殊有疑問，并以爲無論如何，在他一方面之任何行動，似不致會有助於目前局勢」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖六日電〕聯合國機構新聞處六日夜宣稱：聯合國祕書長賴伊已決定對中國戰事不採取任何行動。賴氏原擬在下星期記者招待會上答覆此一問題，但因秘書處一部份職員深感秘書長應卽宣布態度，遂於六日夜發表上項聲明。</p>

<p>〔本報南京七日電〕共黨對總統呼籲和平之元旦文告，尚無正式反應，首都政界七日仍保持平靜，惟外間謠傳甚多，有稱總統將於短期內再度發表文告，就渠之進退作更進一步之表示，有稱總統之去留將於十日內決定者，記者頃訪政洽方面某負責人士，詢其以上各情，據稱，凡此種種，純係謠言，絕不可靠。另悉：張羣將於八日離京，聞其目的地可能爲漢口，此行係應</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京七日電〕張治中七日午設宴款待陳立夫等要員，度間討論一般局勢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京七日電〕張治中將軍七日繼續忙於與大批官員討論對共產黨非正式拒絕和談後引起之黝黯前途的措施，其中並持別包括李宗仁副總統及前行玫院長長羣。張治中對其友人稱，渠仍希望中共能「改變觀念」，深信和平解決仍能淮行。</p>
<p>〔又電〕高級官方七日晚稱，政府卽將向美，蘇兩國或四強提出一正式辦法，以調停及協助將政府之和平建議勸吿共產黨。該方又稱：外交部專家已完成邀請四強調解問題之研究及邀請之程序，此項研究乃奉行政院長孫科之訓令。據悉：外交部專家已將邀請四強斡之利弊各點之報各以及邀請程序之備忘錄交與孫院長。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電」首者外交界人士對聯合國秘書長賴伊日前宣布渠正研究我國當前局勢，並考慮斡旋和談之可能性一節，認頗重要。七日此間政治空氣雖然沉靜，然由各項事勢之不斷發展，令人確覺和平之爭取者，所可作爲者良多，某國際政治學者語記者，倘聯合國認爲中國內戰之演進將危害世界和平之保持，依據法理，實有權加以考慮，至若中國政府以此一本身不得解決之問題付諸聯合國，請參與調停，亦無不可，唯多數人之意見，國際調處之關鍵，實緊於某一大國對和平問題之態度，彼等認爲中國之唯一盟國，亦係希望中國之內爭得和平解決者，然該國可測不願單獨出面，故聯合國調停或四強調停之方式，極有成爲事實之可測。某外交官員並表示其私人意見謂，如果中國問題提出於聯合國，並經受理，則和平之努力必須成功，蓋如中國問題僅由中國本身或其邀請之友邦與調處，其成敗之直接影響，亦僅及於中國之命運及友邦之顏面，然若使之爲聯合國之一新課題，則其成敗，將爲聯合國之嚴重考騐，國際問對此將作如何考慮，實值得注意。</p>
<h3>蒲立特向美援外會報告　建議八億美元援華　籲請從速恢復「飛虎隊」　告美記者稱應派麥帥率軍官來華</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓六日鴛〕前駐蘇大使蒲立特六日以中國高級領袖等之呼籲提交國會經濟援外聯席監督委員會，籲請從速恢復大戰期內在陳納德少將領導下之「飛虎隊」。蒲氏並要求美國「全面」援華計劃，建議以八億美元作軍事與經濟之援助，包括在美軍官監督下訓練中國新軍。蒲立特向該委會報吿渠最近訪問中國所得。若千委員警吿稱，蒲氏之證詞或將使政府爲難，故要求舉行秘密會議而如願以債。彼等復堅持該報吿之公布僅作爲蒲氏之調查所得，而非表示該委會之見解。蒲立特在會後吿新聞記者稱：渠相信政府軍能固守長江沿岸以阻止中共，渠又謂：「爲時已遲，甚遲，但並不過遲」。蒲氏報吿中曾提及「飛虎隊」。據該委會方面息，蒲氏轉遞重建美國志願飛行隊之呼籲。蒲氏曾吿該委員會稱，此舉足爲給予蔣總統之最有效與迅速之援助。蒲立特所主張之八億美元援華計劃中，計有訓練華南新軍之經費三億美元，新軍係由美軍官訓練及配備，軍事供應一億美元，棉花，煤斤，汽油，食物等共二億美元，以及價值一億美元之白銀作爲政府軍之軍餉，此項計劃並不列於蒲氏正式報吿之內。</p>
<p>國會經濟援外聯席監督委員會主席勃里奇贊成此一報吿。渠稱，美國在冒讓整個亞洲赤化之「大險」，並謂美政府未曾表明遠東方面「對抗共黨侵略之明確政策」。</p>
<p>蒲立特報吿稱，「爲挽回中國戰事之局勢」，美國必須派遺美「作戰將領」一人掌握中國戰事之指揮及管理大權。渠認爲蔣總統缺乏足以處理有關應付共黨攻勢之全盤間題之將領。蒲氏稱，共軍人數在二百萬以上。蒲氏報吿其他結論如下：（一）蔣總統部下少校階級以上之軍官，多人均爲「力不勝任而不忠實，尤以將領爲然」。（二）中國士兵如經適當訓練，，飽食與指導，足與世界上任何兵士相媲美，許多下級軍官尤爲卓越。（三）單靠經濟援助可「稍阻」共黨之征服中國，而并無美方指導與管理之軍事及經濟援助「大爲展延」此項發展。（四）欲使中國有任何眞正與永久之成就，「美方之指導與管理」，實與供應援助同樣重要。蒲氏之結論有謂：「吾人必須承認，吾人正位於人類歷史轉捩點之一，吾人之決定不容有所錯誤，蓋問題不僅在於中國之獨立，且在美國之獨立」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕蒲立特六日向記者宣稱，美國應派麥帥率領軍官六百人至中國，協助該國政府擊敗共軍，深信麥帥可較其他將領以更少時間完成此種任務。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京七日電〕蒲立特六日主張再請麥部助華作戰，此間尚未立卽發生反響，但一般認爲此事目前不致實現。麥帥本人態度亦保守緘默。最近有人曾以此事相詞，所得答復爲麥帥無意離日。聞麥帥認中國時局極嚴重，久已澦料中共將有重大進展，麥帥左右正密切注視局勢之發展。多數美國軍官私下表示，供給中國政府軍充分空軍可使共黨敗挫，但能否給予此種援助而不使美國嚴格控制中國軍事尚爲極大疑問。據麥帥左右稱：麥帥不擬接受己故史迪威將軍之地位屈居蔣總統之下。無論如何麥帥在未獲正式任命前，不致表明態度。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕參衆兩院援外經濟合作監督委員會主席勃里奇今日宣稱，中國人口佔世界人口之四分之一，吾人如任其爲共產黨佔領而無具體積極政策對付之，殊非得計。或問勃氏是否知道美國將有一援華新計劃，勃氏答曰不知。</p>
<p>美議員史米茲要求發表魏德邁報告書</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕共和黨衆院外委會委員史米茲，今日以中國局勢緊急要求政府發表前杜魯門總統特使魏德邁在華調查報吿書。史氏稱：魏德邁報吿書從未發表，據余所知，該報吿書曾指國務卿馬歇爾堅持之對華政策完全錯誤，馬氏主張不給予中國政府有效的援助，以待其羅致中共組織聯合政府。魏氏並提議特別援助蔣總統之軍隊以防止中共佔領全中國，一如目前之情形，余認爲馬歇爾與杜魯門對於中國目前之局勢，難辭其咎。萬一將來中共控制整個中國，則美國在太平洋所獲之勝利卽歸鳥有，此種情景較西歐若干國家之陷落更爲悲慘，吾人之整個前途繫於太平洋。</p>

<h3>再抗議武裝日本！</h3>
<p>關於美國扶助日本再武裝問題，引起了遠東各國　注視，尤其美蘇兩國對於這問題的爭執，最近幾乎係槍舌劍，愈演愈烈。從國際關係上說，美蘇對於遠東問題的認識，顯然有了很大的分歧；從中國民族立塲上說，日本再武裝對於中國的威脅，與蘇聯感受的威脅相同，中蘇是同感不利的。我們站在國際關係和中國民族生存的立塲，應無疑義的，對於美國再武裝日本這件事，應再表示嚴重的抗議！</p>
<p>美國單獨扶助日本復與，是政治經濟文化多方面的事實，而日本戰爭潛力的復興，如軍需工業的復活與警察力量的擴充，則完全表徵一個舊日本的車國主義在復活中。前任麥帥助手艾契堡·去年十二月向美當局提出武裝日本的建議一件，主張設立日警十五萬人，以應付目前遠東局勢的劇變。後來又盛傳麥帥建議美國應採取行動以重新武裝日本，並傳麥帥下令重建日本軍隊及重築被戰爭損毀之公路；中蘇兩國爲重視此項傳聞，曾先後向美國表示譴責之意。蘇聯駐美大使兼出席遠東委員會代表潘友新，十二月卅日發表責詢再武裝日本的談話，要求美團將專實提出遠東委員會討論，杜魯門總統當即發表談話，否認有此事實，但杜魯門未否認艾契堡麥帥兩人提出任何建議，這是美蘇對這個問題爭執的第一個回合。本月五日東京的日本盟管會開會，蘇聯代表狄里夫揚柯大聲疾呼，指斥日本正藉美國之扶助，向建立武裝力量三十萬人的目標邁進。狄氏警吿稱：此舉將使日本握有相當十七個步兵師的武力，即日本在一九三一年發動東北事變前五年時的力量，渠復指斥美國未將此事實提出遠東委員會和日本盟管會討論。美國代表西伯特當即辯正，指認蘇代表的估計過大，跡似跨張，但無由否認毫無此事；這是美蘇對這個問題爭執的第二個回合。</p>
<p>由上述美蘇兩國駁辯的情勢看來，更根據近日若干事實的表現看來，可知日本之再武裝，已由美國鼓勵而見諸實行了！這在我們看來，應該是一樁驚心動魄的事；我們希望民間輿論和政府當局，對於美國復活日本軍國主義這樁措施，迅速的有效的採取下列步驟，以表示我國正大的立塲。</p>
<p>第一，我們的興論界和日本問題專家，應根據民族主義立塲，對日本之重整軍備，加緊武裝，表示一種堅强的抗議。美國人士對於遠東問題的認識，以爲抉助日本即可安定遠東，這是萬分錯覺的看法，這種錯覺如無新的轉向，美國的未來遠東地位，必將自食其惡果。</p>
<p>第二，我們出席遠東委員會和日本盟管會的代表，應根據波茨坦宣言精神及遠委會對日基本政策的決定，對日本再武裝這樁重大的事件，提出嚴重的抗議與反對。我們有權利也有立塲，以堂堂之旗，正正之鼓，表示我國抗議的態度。如果美國不接受中蘇各國的抗議，仍以扶助日本再武裝的事實作答覆，則我們應該對於日本管制現狀，表示一種不承認的態度。日本以爲「旣成事實」可獲未來和會的承認，此乃日本的奢求，祗要我們在遠委會的立塲堅定，任何一樁「旣成事實」，將來也有機會被否定的。</p>
<p>三年以來，盟總管制日本的若干措施，多超出了軌道，多違反了法理，世界各國輿論已有很多的責詢。我們希望遠東局勢早獲安定，日本問題能有澈底澄淸之一日。要之，在公正標準的和約下，我們不反對日本復興，並且贊成日本復興，惟我們有一個堅定的原則，即反對日本軍國主義的復活！</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統向新國會　提出聯邦經濟報告　要求授權阻止物價上漲擴大推行社會福利事業</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統七日要求國會授權阻止一切物價之上漲，直至「對渠等之立法」之公意能獲得時爲止。總統基於經濟顧問院爲渠準備之檢討書，向國會提出聯邦經濟之每年報吿。經濟報吿之大部份與其五日提出之聯邦咨文類似，但包括更多之細節。杜魯門在長篇之立法建議中，重申增稅四十億之請求，並稱，此項增稅之主要來源，其對象當爲公司。染稱，公司利潤稅之增高可能採用，而不致「不適當地干涉繼續擴展營業之前途，並担保在徵棁及分配紅利後之利潤，仍足敷投資及臨時費用。」杜魯門並要求增加中高階級之所得稅·地產稅。遺產稅及「附加土貨稅」，要求管制特種物價及有關之工資，要求授權下令在相當時期內阻止物價上漲，同時進入對立法之民意調查。雖然總統仍保持「正常的集體談判將能促成工資之合理調整」的理論，渠重申國會當授權政府「限制足以破壞最高限價之工資調整」。渠允許以「謹愼限制聯邦費用」爲協助平衡預算之另一方式。杜魯門要求：（一）政府財政以减少公債之方式處理；（二）繼續對消費分期信用之聯邦法規；（三）暫時擴展對「缺乏的主要物資」的分配管制，以及繼續在鐵路運輸中之優先分配機構；（四）繼續房租管制至少二年並加强監督，（五）擴大輸出管制；（六）擴大聯邦對防止過度投機或操縱商品交換價格之權力。在建議之另一部份，渠要求採取若千措施，以保護「通貨膨脹下之犧牲者」，其中包括擴大社會安全之範圍，以及增高最低工資自每小時七角五分（原定四角）。其他建議之大部份述及農村政策·自然資源·國際貿易及房屋問題·敎育問題·公共衛生問題等，均與其聯邦咨文中所提者吻合。杜魯門對國會之報吿中，並附以經濟顧問院之檢討書。檢討書中稱，美國如果希望保特其精神威望及政治領導權的世界地位，則必須主動地支持全世界無數人類的希望。檢討書中稱，美國自其他國家輸入其製成品將有助力，並可望實現，向國外投資以助彼等生產亦屬需要，但其他國家必須對提供之資金「給予適當之安全担保」，俾能獲得大量貸款。</p>
<h3>尼基夫前綫自昨午起　猶埃軍遵令停戰　由聯合國協助下舉行和談</h3>

<h3>六航空公司爭權利抗訴　對承運國際難民不滿　民航局邀代表協商脣槍舌劍不歡而散</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市中國·泛美·西北·荷蘭·法國·香港等六大商業航空公司，因國際難民組織（IRO）遣送在華國際難民，僅與美商大洋航空公司（Trans　Ocean　Airlines）獨家訂約包運，同表不滿，要求國際難民組織分予承運權利，朱能如願，六大公司乃向民航局抗訴，民航局一面下令暫停大洋航空公司飛機起降，一面派該局業務處處長蕭立坤來滬，於昨日邀集各該航空公司及國際難民組織代表，聽取雙方理由，以憑公斷。該談話會於下午三時在中國航空公司接待室召開，國際難民組織及大洋航空公司代表與泛美中國等六大航空公司之代表雙方唇槍舌劍，爭執頗烈。國際難民組織代表並指民航局無權過問此事，各航空公司如欲承包運送難民，應直接向國際難民組織商洽，國際難民組織之選擇何家則由日內瓦總部決定。但泛美等六大公司代表則認爲彼等均有定期航綫，大洋航空公司並無定期航棧，相較之下彼等應有優先承運權，至少亦應享受同等機會，而國際難民組織則對彼等所求，置之不理云。結果爭辯良久，不歡而散。據民航局蕭處長談，此事將請示南京以決定如何處置，民航局之立塲並無所偏袒，僅因六大航空公司旣提出抗訴，民航局自不得不加以干預。又據熟悉內幕者談；國際難民組織與大洋航空公司訂約付給美金廿五萬元，每次空運難民按照規定成本另加百分之七費用，多還少補，利潤甚爲優厚，故各大航空公司均欲分嘗一杯羹云。</p>

<h3>銀根轉鬆銷路活躍　白粳又叩八百大關　麵粉食油雜糧一致上漲</h3>
<p>昨日米市又趨上漲，到貨雖多，但因戶口米價更改提高，人心轉振，執貨者扳價，銀根又轉鬆，池戶納胃頗濃，開市卽提升四五十元。中市以後，因米店納胃已足，故略轉懈，收市回疲五元至十元。白粳重抵八百元，計漲四十元。薄稻出八百元外，爲八百二十元，上漲五十元。糯米因年底銷活，市勢特俏，白元竄出九百元外，爲九百三十元，亦漲五十元。北市塲白粳，薄稻各爲八百元，各米均漲四五十元。二市到貨共計一萬二千九百二十一石。</p>
<p>麵粉　重吿回升，因銀根轉鬆，米價及圈外物價均漲，人心亦看高，開市時最爲堅俏，故開價頗高。老車粉以三百六十五元開出，兵船開市三百五十五元，後因逢高有出，轉趨下降。老車收市三百四十七元，軋漲十二元。兵船因上日價格過高，故收市價反低三元。紅蜂，建成各軋漲七八元。麩皮漲十五六元。</p>
<p>食油　價格猛力回升，因銀根緊勢已戢，散戶復有吸取，加以業外物價上漲人心看高，市勢特俏。豆油初爲二千八百元，後突出三千元外，最後三千一百元。生菜油收市二千九百元，各漲四百五十元，計挺一成半。吉桶生油收市三千一百元，上漲四百元。豆餅散戶搶吸，市轉俏俐。長字收市開二百五十元，上漲五十元之多。</p>

<h3>行莊增資現金今日正式動用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於申請動用行莊增資現金部份問題，迄昨日爲止，經金管局核准者，已達四百三十萬金圓左右，預計今日可正式動用。惟首次申請動用之款項，不得超過繳存資金之三分之一，第二次得動用餘數之三分之二，第三次可悉數動用，期限普通爲一週及十天，最多不得超過一個月。</p>
<h3>國行提高利率</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行重貼現及同業拆放利率，因受市塲波動暗息高昻影響，昨起已有提高。重點現日拆，已改爲每千元十九元三角三分（原爲十一元三角三分）同業拆放日拆改爲每千元十六元（原爲九元六角）。</p>
<h3>市上游資日多行莊存款銳減</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近因物價波動，行莊存款又復銳减。據金融界人士表示：自新年以來，庫存紛紛流出，每日各行莊被客戶提現者甚多，估計目前全市行莊之存款，不足金圓券四億元。外埠資金因局勢關係，亦紛紛流向本市，估計市上之游資，殆不下十五億元，此批資金均在金融圈外活動，對物價影響甚大，當局對此雖甚注意，但迄無有效對策。另據金管局方面透露；目前游資充斥，對物價波動有密切關係，該局現對行莊業務，正密切注意，檢査帳目將經常進行，如査獲有業外活動者將嚴辦</p>
<h3>匯款逐漸解出銀根走勢已鬆</h3>
<p>銀根走勢，穩中帶弛，各業市塲暗息，晨開均在四角左右，惟以買氣旺盛，各方需要頭寸殷切，暗息乃見上升，迄午大致站定五角左右。</p>
<p>又訊，銀根走勢參差，業外各帮，需求殷切，頭寸供源，因外埠匯款，已由中央銀行解出一部，略轉冗盛，業内缺單情形好轉。市塲拆息：高低不一，最高做日拆五十元，低則四十元有交，合月息一元二角至五角。一般觀察，銀根下週將鬆，因工貸卽將有部份發放，而游資蝟集將甚。</p>
<p>昨日現鈔籌碼甚緊，尤以大鈔爲最。各行莊限制提現額度，自一千元至五千元不等。市間貼水有發生。</p>
<h3>僑匯牌價未動</h3>
<p>僑匯牌價，數日來均爲一百卅元，據主管方面宣稱，因金價須按僑匯牌價加收平衡費，故僑匯牌價調整，足以提高金價，而刺激物價，故主管方面對僑匯牌價之調整，極爲審愼。一般預料，當局如將僑匯牌價固定於一點，結果將犧牲僑匯。或係鑒於過去掛牌吸收僑匯以來，成效並不顯著之故云。</p>
<h3>貼放會舉行會議　通過貸款十四案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕央行貼放會工礦顧問委員會昨日下午三時舉行第二十四次會議，出席朱通九支秉淵等二十餘人，討論有關公用交通礦產鹽運造紙火柴原料等工業申請貸款案共十七件，除婉却及査明再議等案外，計通過十四件，以上各案均須提下次貼放會核定。又該會出口及生產事業貸款審査會因工礦會散會較遲，改於今日午後三時舉行。</p>

<p>布市以銀根略轉鬆動，吸戶納胃轉旺，買風大熾，趨勢頓轉快利，市價緩步挺升。細布檔子因紡建公司久未開售，致市上籌碼枯乾，走勢頗爲活潑。龍頭細布初開卽見一五五〇元之新高價，中途雖曾喊低至一四七〇元，但午收復回至一五四〇元，結果較前漲起一九〇元。中檔細布僅做開天津廠32五福與靑島廠大雙龍，他若喇叭童五福等皆無貨供應。四君子元嗶嘰由一四〇〇元退至一三六〇元爲最低，臨收復轉堅俏，終以一四二〇元結局，軋升一八〇元。四君子元直貢好起，一七〇元，以一四六〇元收布。廠方開價大多提高一〇〇元左右。</p>

        <h1>1949.01.08</h1>
<h3>Truman Announces Marshall's Resignation; Acheson to Succeed as Secretary of State; Policy Towards Soviets Will Not Soften</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] New York, 7th (Broadcast from Washington): Secretary of State Marshall, due to physical exhaustion following kidney surgery, has requested to resign. President Truman has approved the resignation and appointed Acheson as Secretary of State. Marshall will step down on January 20, the start of Truman's new term. In announcing Marshall's resignation, Truman emphasized that U.S. foreign policy would not change as a result, and that the U.S. would continue to take a firm stance toward the Soviet Union and support the United Nations. Truman specifically stated that the policy towards the Soviets had not softened. The new Secretary of State Acheson, 55, is a man of distinguished appearance who served as Under Secretary of State for many years, resigning six months after Marshall became Secretary of State.</p>
<p>After resigning in June 1947, Acheson resumed his law practice in Washington. Resigning at the same time as Marshall was Under Secretary Lovett, who succeeded Acheson as Under Secretary. Truman stated that Webb, Director of the Budget Bureau, who had served as an advisor in the White House for many years, would succeed as Under Secretary of State, and his vacant position would be filled by the current Deputy Director of the Budget Bureau, Frank. Marshall's forced resignation due to physical exhaustion will bring to an end the era of major U.S. foreign policy decisions that began on January 21, 1947, when Marshall reluctantly took office as Secretary of State. It also marks the end of Marshall's glorious career, which spanned two World Wars. As Chief of Staff, he led the nation's army in the largest war in history.</p>
<p>The President praised Marshall as "America's greatest soldier" and said that approving his resignation was a last resort and "deeply regrettable." Truman told reporters that he considered Marshall an outstanding figure during World War II, and initially believed that Marshall would recover and continue to serve. The appointment of the new Secretary of State is subject to Senate approval, but Acheson is highly respected, and the Democratic Party is in power in the current Congress, so approval is not expected to be a problem. Senators Thomas and Green of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee expressed strong praise after learning of the news.</p>
<p>Acheson issued a statement saying that he was very surprised by the appointment, and that the President had not contacted him beforehand. He said he felt a great responsibility and would do his best. He did not intend to make any changes within the State Department and expressed "excitement" about the President's appointment of Webb as his assistant.</p>
<p>Truman said that Marshall had requested to resign on January 3, and although he hoped he would recover and continue to serve, he did not want to force him to stay and damage his health. Truman strongly denied that there was any difference between the "Forrestal-Marshall-Lovett foreign policy" and Truman's policy, and said that the policy was always formulated by him personally and faithfully implemented by Marshall. As for Lovett's resignation, the President said it was for "personal reasons." The President praised Lovett's achievements as Under Secretary of State.</p>

At the same time, they concentrated artillery fire to bombard us fiercely. More than 50,000 shells landed in one day and night, turning all the bombarded areas into scorched earth. The bandits also fired many crippling and tear gas shells. Due to a lack of medicine, the poisoned officers and soldiers of our defending army could not be treated and suffered heavy casualties, resulting in the breakthrough of several positions.

On the western side of the road, the fighting was quiet today. We are carrying out work in areas such as Outang to destroy the bandit's core organizations and appease the people.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 7th] The military, in order to prevent the Jinpu Railway between Bengbu and Gugujian from being used by the bandits, ordered the demolition of the Huaibei railroad tracks.

<p>[United Press Dispatch from Lake Success, 6th] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie declared on the 6th that he had decided not to intervene in the Chinese war. According to an official announcement: Lie had "carefully considered" the matter and could not see that "any action on his part would be helpful to the present situation." The question of whether the United Nations would intervene in the Chinese war was raised at Lie's first press conference on the 5th after his return from the Paris General Assembly meeting. At that time, he said that he would "consider" whether the United Nations could do anything to stop the civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists. The United Nations announced on the 6th: "The Secretary-General has carefully considered this issue, and he believes that his authority to take any action is highly questionable, and that in any case, any action on his part would not be helpful to the present situation."</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Lake Success, 6th] The United Nations Information Office announced on the night of the 6th: United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie has decided not to take any action on the Chinese war. Lie originally intended to answer this question at a press conference next week, but because some staff members of the Secretariat felt that the Secretary-General should immediately announce his position, the above statement was issued on the night of the 6th.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun to Depart for Hankou Today; Many Rumors About Peace in Nanjing; Negotiations to Invite the U.S., Soviet Union, or Four Powers to Mediate Are About to Take Place</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] The Communist Party has not yet formally responded to the President's New Year's Day message calling for peace. The political circles in the capital remained calm on the 7th, but there were many rumors circulating. Some said that the President would issue another message in the near future, making a further statement about his own advancement or retreat. Others said that the President's decision to stay or leave would be made within ten days. The reporter recently visited a responsible person in political circles and inquired about the above matters. According to the person, all of these were pure rumors and absolutely unreliable. It was also learned that Zhang Qun will leave Nanjing on the 8th. It is said that his destination may be Hankou. This trip is in response to ______.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet at noon on the 7th to entertain important officials such as Chen Lifu, during which they discussed the general situation.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] General Zhang Zhizhong continued to be busy on the 7th discussing measures to address the bleak future caused by the Communist Party's informal rejection of peace talks with a large number of officials, including Vice President Li Zongren and former Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun. Zhang Zhizhong told his friends that he still hoped that the CCP could "change its mind" and believed that a peaceful solution could still be achieved.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Senior officials said on the evening of the 7th that the government would soon submit a formal proposal to the United States, the Soviet Union, or the Four Powers to mediate and assist in persuading the Communist Party to accept the government's peace proposals. The official also said that experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had completed a study of the advantages and disadvantages of inviting the Four Powers to mediate and the procedures for the invitation. This study was ordered by Executive Yuan President Sun Ke. It is understood that the experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have submitted a report to President Sun on the advantages and disadvantages of inviting the Four Powers to mediate, as well as a memorandum on the invitation procedures.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Foreign diplomatic circles in the capital believe that United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie's recent announcement that he is studying the current situation in China and considering the possibility of mediating peace talks is very important. Although the political atmosphere here was calm on the 7th, the continuous development of various events makes people feel that there is much that can be done to strive for peace. An international political scholar told reporters that if the United Nations believes that the evolution of the Chinese civil war will endanger the maintenance of world peace, it has the right to consider it in accordance with legal principles. As for the Chinese government submitting this problem that it cannot solve itself to the United Nations and asking to participate in mediation, it is not impossible. However, the opinion of the majority is that the key to international mediation is closely related to the attitude of a certain major power towards the peace issue. They believe that China's only ally also hopes that China's internal disputes can be resolved peacefully, but the country can be expected not to come forward alone. Therefore, the method of United Nations mediation or Four Powers mediation is very likely to become a reality. A diplomatic official also expressed his personal opinion, saying that if the China issue is brought before the United Nations and accepted, the efforts for peace must succeed. If the China issue is only mediated by China itself or its invited allies, the direct impact of its success or failure will only affect the fate of China and the face of its allies. However, if it is made a new issue for the United Nations, its success or failure will be a serious test for the United Nations. How the international community will consider this is worth paying attention to.</p>
<h3>Bullitt Reports to U.S. Foreign Aid Committee, Recommends $800 Million in Aid to China, Urges Speedy Restoration of "Flying Tigers," Tells American Reporters that MacArthur Should Be Sent to Lead Officers to China</h3>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 6th] Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union William C. Bullitt submitted an appeal from senior Chinese leaders, etc. to the Joint Congressional Committee on Foreign Economic Assistance on the 6th, urging a speedy restoration of the "Flying Tigers" under the leadership of Major General Claire Chennault during the war. Bullitt also requested a "comprehensive" aid to China plan, recommending $800 million in military and economic aid, including the training of new Chinese troops under the supervision of U.S. officers. Bullitt reported to the committee on his recent visit to China. Some committee members warned that Bullitt's testimony might embarrass the government, so they requested a closed-door meeting and got their wish. They insisted that the publication of the report should only be considered as Bullitt's findings, and not express the views of the committee. Bullitt told reporters after the meeting that he believed that the government army could hold the Yangtze River coast to stop the CCP. He also said: "It is late, very late, but not too late." Bullitt's report mentioned the "Flying Tigers." According to sources from the committee, Bullitt conveyed the appeal to rebuild the American Volunteer Air Force. Bullitt told the committee that this would be the most effective and rapid assistance to President Chiang. The $800 million in aid to China plan advocated by Bullitt includes $300 million for training new troops in southern China. The new troops will be trained and equipped by U.S. officers, $100 million for military supplies, $200 million for cotton, coal, gasoline, food, etc., and $100 million worth of silver as military pay for the government army. This plan is not included in Bullitt's official report.</p>
<p>Representative Bridges, chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Foreign Economic Assistance, agreed with the report. He said that the United States was "taking a big risk" of allowing all of Asia to become communist, and said that the U.S. government had not stated "a clear policy to counter communist aggression" in the Far East.</p>
<p>Bullitt's report stated that "in order to reverse the situation in the Chinese war," the United States must send a U.S. "combat general" to take command of the Chinese war and manage it. He believed that President Chiang lacked generals who could handle the overall issues related to dealing with the Communist offensive. Bullitt said that the Communist army numbered more than two million. Other conclusions of Bullitt's report are as follows: (1) Many of the officers above the rank of major under President Chiang are "incompetent and disloyal, especially the generals." (2) If properly trained, fed, and guided, Chinese soldiers are comparable to any soldiers in the world, and many junior officers are particularly outstanding. (3) Economic aid alone can "slightly impede" the Communist conquest of China, but military and economic aid "greatly extends" this development without U.S. guidance and management. (4) In order for China to have any real and lasting achievements, "U.S. guidance and management" is as important as providing aid. Bullitt concluded: "We must recognize that we are at one of the turning points in human history. Our decisions cannot be wrong, because the question is not only about China's independence, but also about America's independence."</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 6th] Bullitt told reporters on the 6th that the United States should send MacArthur to lead 600 officers to China to help the country's government defeat the Communist army. He believed that MacArthur could complete this task in less time than other generals.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Tokyo, 7th] Bullitt's proposal on the 6th to ask MacArthur to help China in the war again has not yet had an immediate reaction here, but it is generally believed that this will not happen at present. MacArthur himself remains conservative and silent. Recently, someone has mentioned this to him, and the reply was that MacArthur has no intention of leaving Japan. It is said that MacArthur believes that the situation in China is extremely serious and has long predicted that the CCP will make major progress. People around MacArthur are closely watching the development of the situation. Many American officers privately expressed that giving the Chinese government army sufficient air force can defeat the Communist Party, but whether this aid can be given without the United States strictly controlling the Chinese military is still a very big question. According to people around MacArthur: MacArthur does not intend to accept the position of the late General Stilwell and be subordinate to President Chiang. In any case, MacArthur will not express his position until he receives a formal appointment.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 6th] Representative Bridges, Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation, declared today that China accounts for one-quarter of the world's population. It would not be wise for us to allow it to be occupied by the Communist Party without a concrete and positive policy to deal with it. When asked if Bridges knew that the United States would have a new aid to China plan, Bridges replied that he did not know.</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Smith Requests Publication of Wedemeyer Report</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 6th] Republican Representative Smith, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, today demanded that the government publish the investigation report of former President Truman's special envoy to China, General Albert Wedemeyer, due to the urgent situation in China. Smith said: The Wedemeyer report has never been published. As far as I know, the report pointed out that Secretary of State Marshall's insistence on a policy towards China was completely wrong. Marshall advocated not giving the Chinese government effective assistance and waiting for it to recruit the CCP to organize a coalition government. Wedemeyer also proposed special assistance to President Chiang's army to prevent the CCP from occupying all of China, as is the case today. I believe that Marshall and Truman are responsible for the current situation in China. If the CCP controls the entire China in the future, then the victory that the United States won in the Pacific will be lost. This situation is more tragic than the fall of some Western European countries. Our entire future depends on the Pacific.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Another Protest Against an Armed Japan!</h3>
<p>The issue of the United States assisting Japan's rearmament has attracted the attention of various countries in the Far East. In particular, the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union on this matter has recently become almost a war of words, intensifying day by day. From the perspective of international relations, the United States and the Soviet Union clearly have significant differences in their understanding of the Far East issue. From the standpoint of the Chinese nation, the threat posed by Japan's rearmament to China is the same as the threat felt by the Soviet Union. China and the Soviet Union share the same concerns. Standing on the positions of international relations and the survival of the Chinese nation, we should, without a doubt, once again express our serious protest against the United States' rearmament of Japan!</p>
<p>The United States' unilateral assistance to Japan's recovery is a multifaceted reality, encompassing political, economic, and cultural aspects. The resurgence of Japan's war potential, such as the revival of the military industry and the expansion of police forces, fully symbolizes the revival of the old Japanese militarism. Archibald, a former aide to General MacArthur, submitted a proposal to the US authorities in December of last year, advocating for the establishment of a 150,000-strong Japanese police force to cope with the current dramatic changes in the Far East situation. Later, it was widely rumored that General MacArthur suggested that the United States should take action to rearm Japan, and it was also rumored that General MacArthur ordered the reconstruction of the Japanese army and the rebuilding of roads damaged by the war. Both China and the Soviet Union, valuing these rumors, expressed their condemnation to the United States successively. Pan Youxin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States and representative to the Far Eastern Commission, issued a statement on December 30 questioning the rearmament of Japan, demanding that the United States bring the matter to the Far Eastern Commission for discussion. President Truman immediately issued a statement denying this fact, but Truman did not deny that Archibald and MacArthur had made any suggestions. This was the first round of the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union on this issue. On the 5th of this month, a meeting of the Allied Council for Japan was held in Tokyo. The Soviet representative, Derevyanko, loudly denounced that Japan was, with the help of the United States, moving towards the goal of building armed forces of 300,000 men. Derevyanko warned that this move would give Japan the equivalent of seventeen infantry divisions, which was the strength Japan had five years before it launched the Northeast Incident in 1931. He further accused the United States of not bringing this fact to the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan for discussion. The US representative, Sebald, immediately defended, arguing that the Soviet representative's estimate was too large and seemed exaggerated, but he could not deny that nothing of the sort was happening. This was the second round of the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union on this issue.</p>
<p>Judging from the rebuttals between the United States and the Soviet Union as described above, and based on the manifestation of some recent facts, it can be seen that Japan's rearmament has been encouraged by the United States and has begun to be implemented! In our view, this should be a shocking thing. We hope that public opinion and government authorities will take the following steps quickly and effectively regarding the United States' measure of reviving Japanese militarism to express our country's upright position.</p>
<p>First, our opinion leaders and experts on Japanese issues should express a strong protest against Japan's rearmament and intensified armament from a nationalist standpoint. Some Americans believe that helping Japan can stabilize the Far East, which is a very misguided view. If this misconception does not have a new direction, the future Far East position of the United States will inevitably suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Second, our representatives to the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan should, based on the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and the decision of the Far Eastern Commission on basic policies toward Japan, raise a serious protest and opposition to this major event of Japan's rearmament. We have the right and the position to express our country's attitude of protest with a clear banner and a righteous drum. If the United States does not accept the protests of China and the Soviet Union and responds with the fact of assisting Japan's rearmament, then we should express an attitude of non-recognition of the current state of control over Japan. Japan believes that "faits accomplis" can gain recognition in future peace conferences. This is Japan's extravagant hope. As long as our position in the Far Eastern Commission is firm, any "faits accomplis" will have the opportunity to be overturned in the future.</p>
<p>In the past three years, many of the measures taken by the Allied Headquarters to control Japan have gone beyond the track and violated the principles of law. There have been many accusations in world public opinion. We hope that the situation in the Far East will be stabilized as soon as possible, and that the Japanese issue can be thoroughly clarified one day. In short, under a fair and just treaty, we do not oppose Japan's recovery, and we support Japan's recovery. However, we have a firm principle, which is to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!</p>

<h3>Two Legislators Send Letters to President Sun Requesting Adjustment of Public Education Treatment</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] Legislators Wang Xueye and Li Gongquan recently sent letters to President Sun of the Executive Yuan regarding the adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel. The letters stated that prices continue to rise and the cost of living index has risen to seventeen or eighteen times. The treatment of general public education personnel is too low, making it difficult to make a living. They all hope that the adjustment of treatment case passed by the Legislative Yuan will be implemented immediately to save those in dire straits. The colleagues in the Legislative Yuan are also eagerly hoping that you will act according to the propositions you made in the parliament in the past, and make the facilities of today's administration, so that the Legislative and Executive Yuans can cooperate harmoniously, and the public education personnel will be free from cold and starvation, so that they can arouse the spirit of work, improve administrative efficiency, collect people's hearts, and lay the foundation for the overall situation. Whether it is peace or war, it is a necessary move. Recently, the Executive Yuan decided to collect a balance fee for the exchange of gold and silver at a price of 50 US dollars. Think about it, the monthly salary of public education personnel today is only a few silver dollars or even a dozen yuan, and the multiple of the price increase has already lost balance. The adjustment of treatment is even more urgent. A special letter is respectfully submitted, hoping for your consideration.</p>

<h3>Japanese Attempt to Force Overseas Chinese to Pay Taxes; An Overseas Chinese Merchant in Osaka Is Detained; Huang Wanju Is Being Searched for by the Allied Headquarters for a Paper Allocation Case</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Counterintelligence agents of the Allied Headquarters are currently cracking down on two of the richest Taiwanese overseas Chinese in Japan. Wu Baifu, a textile merchant famous in Osaka who donated 10 million yen alone in 1947 to build the only Chinese Engineering College in Japan, is currently being detained on charges of tax evasion. Representatives of our delegation here believe that Wu's detention is the first step in Japan's implementation of greater pressure to force overseas Chinese to pay taxes to the Japanese government in accordance with the regulations of the Allied Headquarters. Counterintelligence agents of the Allied Headquarters are also searching for Huang Wanju, president of the International News Agency. It is reported that Huang has fled elsewhere. He is suspected of engaging in black market transactions with the paper allocated to the agency. Huang recently participated in a 32-member delegation to Taiwan for sightseeing. It is reported that when he left, the Allied Headquarters agents had already seized the account books of his International News Agency. According to the fact that the International News Agency receives 400,000 sheets of allocated paper every day, while its newspaper sales are only 100,000 sheets per day, the Allied Headquarters suspects that he is selling the surplus allocated paper on the black market. Our delegation in Japan is paying close attention to Wu's case, as it involves a wide range. Representatives of our delegation stated that the Japanese government hopes that Wu will pay 8 million yen in taxes in 1947, but Wu assured the Japanese tax collectors that he did not obtain one yen of profit in 1947. Representatives of our delegation continued: "We have repeatedly asked overseas Chinese to pay all ordinary taxes to the Japanese government in accordance with the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission." The delegation may recently reiterate this order to overseas Chinese in various parts of Japan to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings between the compatriots and the Allied Headquarters. Representatives of our delegation also stated that, according to the regulations of the Far Eastern Commission, overseas Chinese in Japan do not need to pay special taxes such as capital special tax and inheritance tax.</p>

<h3>President Truman Submits Federal Economic Report to New Congress: Requests Authorization to Prevent Price Increases and Expand Social Welfare Programs</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 7th] President Truman on the 7th requested Congressional authorization to prevent all price increases until public consensus on "their legislation" can be obtained. The President submitted the annual report on the federal economy to Congress, based on a review prepared for him by the Council of Economic Advisers. The economic report is largely similar to the federal message he submitted on the 5th, but includes more details. In a lengthy legislative proposal, Truman reiterated his request for a four billion dollar tax increase, stating that the main source of this tax increase should be corporations. He stated that an increase in corporate profit taxes could be adopted without "unduly interfering with the prospect of continued business expansion, and ensuring that profits after taxation and distribution of dividends are sufficient for investment and temporary expenses." Truman also requested an increase in income taxes for the middle and upper classes, property taxes, inheritance taxes, and "additional commodity taxes," requesting control over special prices and related wages, and requesting authorization to order the prevention of price increases for a considerable period of time while entering into a public opinion survey on legislation. Although the President still maintains the theory that "normal collective bargaining will promote reasonable adjustments in wages," he reiterated that Congress should authorize the government to "limit wage adjustments that could undermine maximum prices." He allowed for "careful limitation of federal spending" as another way to help balance the budget. Truman requested: (1) government finances be handled in a way that reduces public debt; (2) continuation of federal regulations on consumer installment credit; (3) temporary expansion of allocation controls on "scarce essential materials" and continuation of priority allocation mechanisms in railway transport; (4) continuation of rent control for at least two years and strengthened supervision; (5) expansion of export controls; (6) expansion of federal power to prevent excessive speculation or manipulation of commodity exchange prices. In another part of the proposal, he requested that several measures be taken to protect "victims of inflation," including expanding the scope of social security and raising the minimum wage from 75 cents per hour (originally set at 40 cents). The majority of other recommendations relate to rural policies, natural resources, international trade, housing issues, education issues, public health issues, etc., and are consistent with those mentioned in his federal message. Truman's report to Congress was accompanied by a review from the Council of Economic Advisers. The review stated that if the United States hopes to maintain its spiritual prestige and world leadership position, it must actively support the hopes of countless people around the world. The review stated that it would be helpful and hoped that the United States would import manufactured goods from other countries, and that it is also necessary to invest abroad to help them produce, but other countries must "provide appropriate security guarantees" for the funds provided in order to obtain large loans.</p>
<h3>Negev Front: Jewish and Egyptian Armies Ceasefire as Ordered from Yesterday Afternoon: Peace Talks to Be Held Under UN Assistance</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 7th] Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion ordered a ceasefire on the Negev front to begin at 2:00 PM today (local time).</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 6th] Acting UN Mediator Ralph Bunche announced: Israel and Egypt have agreed to an immediate ceasefire to begin peace talks "as early as possible." The war in the Negev region was originally scheduled to cease at 2:00 PM on the 6th (GMT), but due to telecommunications delays, Bunche telegraphed both Israel and Egypt, requesting that they set noon on the 7th (8:00 PM Shanghai time on the 7th) as the final ceasefire deadline. UN officials say the sudden end to the long-standing Israeli-Egyptian stalemate may be a prelude to a final peaceful resolution of the entire Middle East. Bunche said that Israel has agreed to direct negotiations on Egypt's proposed ceasefire and peace plan, that the UN will participate in and assist in overseeing the matter, and that the time and location of the peace talks are yet to be determined. UN officials pointed out that the Israeli-Egyptian agreement does not mean that the two governments have agreed to a genuine peace. Its achievement was due to secret contacts between UN officials in Cairo and Tel Aviv. The agreement stipulates that the Egyptian and Israeli governments will simultaneously negotiate (1) the Security Council's order issued to both the Arab and Jewish sides on November 16 of last year requesting peace; (2) the withdrawal of Jewish troops from the Negev region to the boundaries occupied before the outbreak of war on October 14 of last year. The UN acknowledges that there are many issues that Israel and Egypt cannot agree on. Bunche said that this development has greatly encouraged him, and that he hopes this negotiation can achieve lasting peace in the Holy Land.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The Far Eastern Commission held a closed-door meeting today and voted 9 to 1, with China abstaining, to reject the Soviet Union's request to abolish MacArthur's ban on strikes and collective bargaining for employees of Japanese state-owned enterprises.

<h3>Labor-Management Discord at the Park Hotel: Employees Appeal for Protection</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] All employees of the Park Hotel in the city have recently appealed to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Restaurant Industry Workers Union, accusing the hotel manager, Lin Mianzhi, of abusing his power and oppressing employees, and requesting protection. The content of their appeal is as follows: (1) According to the labor-management agreement approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, the hotel was originally required to contribute 25% of its total monthly revenue as a living allowance for all employees, and to issue an additional one picul of rice allowance. However, the hotel recently changed the rice allowance to a bonus and did not issue it according to the fixed amount, violating the agreement and arbitrarily exploiting employees. (2) Gu Zhouxuan, the floor supervisor of the hotel's housekeeping department, was fined half a picul of rice allowance and 15 yuan of basic salary by the hotel manager for the crime of "allowing guests to gamble," and was demoted three levels. Gu argued that the guests brought their own gambling equipment, and he had no right to interfere. Furthermore, in the past, he had repeatedly reported guests gambling, but the manager had ignored it. Therefore, he believes that the punishment was inappropriate and that he was being deliberately singled out. (3) Weng Zutong, a worker in the hotel's inspection department, was suspended from his job due to a minor dispute between colleagues. He believes that this is a major punishment according to the hotel's historical regulations. Currently, all employees of the Park Hotel have formed a fellows' group and have indicated that they are determined to fight to the end for the above three matters. If there is no satisfactory result, they may consider going on strike.</p>

Besides passengers, those on board the flight to Japan included a press delegation from Tai City, this newspaper's Deputy Editor-in-Chief Bu Shaofu, Xinwen Bao reporter Yao Yongtai, Director of the English Department of the Central News Agency Qian Yushen, Chief Correspondent of Yi Shi Bao Yin Xueman, and Section Chief Yuan Mingqing from the Shanghai Office of the Government Information Office.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] China Airlines’ Hong Kong-Tokyo route officially opened today. The four-engine Skymaster was piloted by former wartime pilots who flew over the “Hump,” and arrived here at 7:50 PM. A large crowd of welcoming personnel was present. Two Japanese women in kimonos presented flowers to the two Chinese flight attendants to express their welcome. The entire journey took only ten and a half hours, including a one-hour stopover in Shanghai. According to Mr. Zeng, the company representative on board, the new route connects with China Airlines’ existing transportation network, allowing travel from Tokyo to any major city in China within a few hours. In addition to the five journalists, the passengers included Chinese businessmen and members of the Chinese delegation stationed in Japan. The plane will return to Hong Kong tomorrow, and the return passengers will include two Chinese citizens and one Indian citizen. According to Mr. Zeng, the company representative, initial operations are expected to be unprofitable, as the Allied Headquarters prohibits Japanese citizens from traveling to China or through China to Hong Kong. However, its importance lies not in profitability but in pioneering air transportation between China and Japan. He added that the plane will fly from Hong Kong to Tokyo every Friday, with the return flight the next day. The one-way fare is US$226, but those purchasing round-trip tickets will receive a 10% discount. The T-101 Skymaster can accommodate 44 passengers and will depart from here at 6:30 AM tomorrow morning to return to Hong Kong. Shanghai journalists traveling to Japan took a photo in front of the Skymaster before its departure (Photo by this newspaper).</p>
<h3>Lack of Vehicles Causes Overcrowding on Both Lines Again; Shanghai-Hangzhou Dispatch Office Relocates to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway Administration, recently recognizing the increasing complexity of vehicle dispatch on the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines, the significant increase in train arrivals and departures at Hangzhou Station, and the shift in transportation focus from Shanghai to Hangzhou due to the current situation, the Transportation Department of the Administration, after careful consideration, resolutely decided to relocate the Shanghai-Hangzhou Dispatch Office to Hangzhou. It is reported that Mr. Wu Xizhang, the director of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Dispatch Office, along with more than twenty employees, arrived in Hangzhou yesterday and will begin operations today.</p>
<p>Since the tensions in Xuzhou and Subeng, and the evacuation of dependents of public and religious personnel from the capital, Jinghu Railway vehicles have been transporting dependents of public and religious personnel, displaced students, and important government goods. They traveled south on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway via the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Most of these vehicles were retained by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi or Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railways upon reaching their destinations, with very few returning. Consequently, there is an extreme shortage of vehicles on both lines recently, and the number of vehicles attached to all trains in both directions has had to be drastically reduced. This has resulted in the reappearance of passenger overcrowding, with passengers again occupying the roofs and areas around the locomotives. According to railway administration statistics, as of the 5th of this month, a total of 1,007 vehicles have traveled south, including 845 freight cars (carrying 20,156 tons) and 162 passenger cars. Only 20 passenger cars have returned. If these vehicles cannot be returned, the passenger overcrowding on both lines cannot be alleviated in the short term.</p>

<h3>Thug with Hatchet Attacks, Young Woman Shot in the Arm</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, a thug suddenly appeared in the cooking area at No. 17 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road. The man, over thirty years old, was wearing a blue cloth gown and spoke with a local accent. He had a long, round, dark face and was of medium build. Upon seeing a young woman sitting inside, he took out a gun and threatened her. The terrified woman struggled and ran out, shouting "Robber!" The thug fired a shot, hitting the woman in her left arm.

Subsequently, nearby police officers arrived after being notified and transported the woman to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the woman's name is He Meilan, 18 years old, from Ningbo. Her father works as a tea room foreman on the Taichangxiang Shipping Company's Jiangsu ship.

<h3>Six Airlines Fight for Rights, Protest; Dissatisfied with Sole Carrier of International Refugees; Civil Aviation Administration Invites Representatives to Negotiate, Ending in Discord</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Six major commercial airlines in this city, including China, Pan American, Northwest, Dutch, French, and Hong Kong, have expressed dissatisfaction with the International Refugee Organization (IRO) exclusively contracting with the American-owned Trans Ocean Airlines to transport international refugees in China. They requested the IRO to grant them the right to carry refugees. When their request was not fulfilled, the six airlines appealed to the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA). The CAA first ordered the suspension of Trans Ocean Airlines flights and then dispatched Mr. Xiao Likun, Director of the CAA's Business Department, to Shanghai yesterday to invite representatives from the airlines and the IRO to hear both sides' arguments and make a fair judgment. The discussion was held at 3:00 PM in the China Airlines reception room. Representatives from the IRO and Trans Ocean Airlines, along with representatives from Pan American China and the other five airlines, engaged in heated debate. The IRO representative even stated that the CAA had no right to intervene in this matter, and that if airlines wanted to contract to transport refugees, they should negotiate directly with the IRO. The IRO's choice of carriers is determined by its headquarters in Geneva. However, representatives from Pan American and the other five airlines argued that they all have regular routes, while Trans Ocean Airlines does not. Therefore, they should have priority for carriage, or at least enjoy equal opportunity. The IRO ignored their requests. The discussion ended in discord after a long debate. According to Mr. Xiao, Director of the CAA, the matter will be referred to Nanjing for a decision on how to handle it. The CAA has no bias and is only intervening because the six airlines filed an appeal. According to those familiar with the matter, the IRO contracted with Trans Ocean Airlines for US$250,000, with an additional 7% fee for each refugee airlifted, with adjustments made for any difference in cost. The profit margin is very generous, so the major airlines all want to share in the spoils.</p>

<h3>Banking and Trust Industries Issue Joint Telegram Calling for Peace</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking, Money, and Trust Industries Joint Council recently issued a telegram calling for peace. The original text is as follows: To President Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an, and all national organizations and newspapers: Since the failure of political consultations, the flames of war have spread from north to south. Sacrificing countless properties and lives for the sake of the front line to fight over walled cities. It has been over two years, shaking the foundations of the nation and scattering the people's hearts. Prominent figures in society and university professors have long been calling for peace, their voices hoarse. Now President Chiang has issued a New Year's message, also calling for peace, and stating that personal concerns are not considered, which is sincerely and obvious. Mr. Mao flew to Chongqing at the beginning of the political consultations to discuss national affairs. Although there were setbacks and it was not successful, his sincere desire for peace was also seen by the people of the country. They should abandon preconceptions, party affiliations, and all other selfish considerations, immediately cease fire, select representatives to jointly discuss national affairs, and alleviate the suffering of our 450 million compatriots. Some say that peace is more difficult than war and that it may not lead to results. However, the so-called difficulty is due to a lack of sincerity. If there is sincerity, what difficulty is there? Moreover, from the people's perspective, wherever war reaches, homes are destroyed, and in besieged cities, everything is lost. Requisitioning grain leaves the granaries empty, and it is difficult to recruit soldiers. Refugees fill the roads, and corpses fill the ravines. Not only is war more difficult than peace, but it is also unbearable and unspeakable. We in the financial industry have suffered unspeakable effects from the war. If peace is not achieved quickly, we will all perish. Therefore, we send this special telegram, hoping that our sincere hearts will resonate with all levels of the nation to promote peace talks. Then, the people will be fortunate, and our industry will be even more fortunate. Li Ming, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association, Shen Rixin, Chairman of the Shanghai Money Industry Association, Yan Chengde, Acting Chairman of the Trust Industry Association, and all members of the three associations respectfully appeal.</p>

Various propaganda teams and boy scout bands also enthusiastically participated, shouting slogans, distributing leaflets, and playing gongs and drums along the way. They also performed and spoke on the spot, saying that the government had opened the door to peace in consideration of the people's suffering, and that the key to the question of peace and war lies in whether the Communist Party has sincerity. Otherwise, the people should rise up and resolutely fight to the end.</p>

<h3>Money Supply Loosens, Sales Active; Bai Geng Reaches the 800 Mark Again; Flour, Cooking Oil, and Grains All Rise</h3>
<p>The rice market rose again yesterday. Although there were many arrivals, prices changed on the household ration system. Market sentiments revitalized, inventory holders pushed up prices, and the money supply loosened again. Major rice shops had high demand, and the market increased by 40-50 yuan at the opening. After the middle of the day, rice shops had fulfilled their demand, so the market relaxed slightly, and prices fell 5-10 yuan at the close. Bai Geng reached 800 yuan again, an increase of 40 yuan. Bo Dao (thin rice) exceeded 800 yuan, reaching 820 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan. Glutinous rice was in high demand due to year-end sales, and the market was especially brisk. Bai Yuan rose above 900 yuan, reaching 930 yuan, also an increase of 50 yuan. In the northern market, Bai Geng and Bo Dao were both 800 yuan, with all rice prices rising 40-50 yuan. Total arrivals in the two markets were 12,921 shi.</p>
<p>Flour: Prices rebounded due to a loosening of the money supply, rising rice prices, and rising prices of goods outside the stock exchange. Market sentiments were also bullish, and the market was very firm at the opening, so opening prices were quite high. Lao Che brand flour opened at 365 yuan, and Bing Chuan brand opened at 355 yuan. Later, the market turned downward due to selling at high prices. Lao Che closed at 347 yuan, an increase of 12 yuan. Bing Chuan closed 3 yuan lower because the previous day's price was too high. Hong Feng and Jiancheng both rose 7-8 yuan. Bran rose 15-16 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: Prices rebounded sharply due to a loosening of the money supply and renewed buying by small investors. Coupled with rising prices of goods outside the stock exchange and bullish market sentiments, the market was especially brisk. Soybean oil initially opened at 2,800 yuan, then exceeded 3,000 yuan, and finally reached 3,100 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 2,900 yuan, an increase of 450 yuan, a rise of 15%. Ji Tong brand rapeseed oil closed at 3,100 yuan, an increase of 400 yuan. Small investors rushed to buy soybean cake, and the market turned brisk. Chang Zi brand closed at 250 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains: Prices were uniformly firm. Yellow soybeans were bought aggressively by oil factories due to the loosening money supply. Hankou Che Dou rose 80 yuan, closing at 560 yuan. Zha Dou rose sharply by half, and Pinghu Du Dou rose by 10%. Corn rose first and then fell. Stockholders held onto shelled peanuts, and out-of-town buyers remained cautious. Transactions were slow to open, and the closing saw more transactions. Sesame sales were weak, and the market fluctuated. Other commodities such as Yuan wheat, mung beans, and red sorghum all rose.</p>
<h3>Increased Capital of Brokers Officially Available for Use Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] As of yesterday, the Gold Management Bureau approved approximately 4.3 million Gold Yuan regarding the application to use the increased capital of the brokers. It is expected that this will be officially available for use today. However, the amount used for the first application may not exceed one-third of the deposited funds, the second application may use two-thirds of the remaining amount, and the third application may use the full amount. The term is usually one week or ten days, and may not exceed one month.</p>
<h3>National Bank Raises Interest Rates</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to market fluctuations and high underground interest rates, the Central Bank raised its rediscount and interbank lending rates yesterday. The daily rediscount rate has been changed to 19.33 Gold Yuan per 1,000 Yuan (previously 11.33 Yuan). The daily interbank lending rate has been changed to 16 Yuan per 1,000 Yuan (previously 9.6 Yuan).</p>
<h3>Increased Idle Capital in the Market Leads to Sharp Decline in Bank Deposits</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Due to recent price fluctuations, bank deposits have once again sharply declined. According to financial circles, since the New Year, reserves have been flowing out rapidly, with many customers withdrawing cash from various banks daily. It is estimated that the total deposits in banks citywide are less than 400 million Gold Yuan. Due to the current situation, funds from other areas are also flowing into this city, and it is estimated that the idle capital in the market is no less than 1.5 billion yuan. This batch of funds is circulating outside the financial circles, which has a significant impact on prices. Although the authorities are paying close attention to this, there are still no effective countermeasures. In addition, according to the Gold Control Bureau, the current influx of idle capital is closely related to price fluctuations. The bureau is now paying close attention to the business of the banks, and will conduct regular inspections of their accounts. Those found to be engaged in activities outside of their permitted business will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Remittances Gradually Released, Easing Credit Conditions</h3>
<p>Credit conditions are trending towards easing amidst stability. The underground interest rates in various industries and markets opened at around forty cents in the morning. However, due to strong buying interest and urgent demand for funds from all parties, underground interest rates rose, eventually stabilizing at around fifty cents by noon.</p>
<p>In other news, credit conditions are mixed. Various non-financial groups have urgent needs, but the supply of funds has slightly improved because the central bank has released a portion of remittances from other areas. The shortage of funds within the industry has improved. Market interbank lending rates vary, with the highest reaching 50 yuan for overnight loans and the lowest at 40 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 1.20 to 1.50 yuan. General observations suggest that credit conditions will ease next week, as some industrial loans are about to be issued and idle capital will be heavily concentrated.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the availability of cash was tight, especially for large bills. Various banks restricted the amount of cash withdrawals, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 yuan. Premiums occurred in the market.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittance Rates Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>The exchange rate for overseas remittances has been 130 yuan for several days. According to relevant authorities, the gold price must include a balancing fee based on the overseas remittance rate. Adjusting the overseas remittance rate would increase the gold price and stimulate commodity prices. Therefore, the relevant authorities are extremely cautious about adjusting the overseas remittance rate. It is generally expected that if the authorities fix the overseas remittance rate at one point, it will sacrifice overseas remittances. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the effectiveness of absorbing overseas remittances through posting rates in the past has not been significant.</p>
<h3>Loan Discount Committee Holds Meeting, Approves Fourteen Loan Applications</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The Industrial and Mining Advisory Committee of the Central Bank Loan Discount Committee held its 24th meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. More than 20 people, including Zhu Tongjiu and Zhi Bingyuan, attended. They discussed 17 loan applications related to public utilities, transportation, mining, salt transport, papermaking, matches, raw materials, and other industries. In addition to applications that were rejected or required further investigation, a total of 14 were approved. All of the above cases must be submitted to the next Loan Discount Committee for approval. In addition, the Export and Production Enterprise Loan Review Committee postponed its meeting, originally scheduled to be held after the Industrial and Mining Committee adjourned, to 3:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Food Prices Continue to be Buoyant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was active because credit conditions remained tight, and holders sold off, leading to a trend of initially soft prices followed by a rise. At the close, prices uniformly increased. No. 45 sugar closed at 2080 yuan, up 330 yuan. Prices for all other grades rose uniformly by more than 20%.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The raw silk market showed strength again yesterday. Credit conditions were tight within the industry, but due to the rise in the financial securities and other markets, buying interest was strong, and prices for all grades reached new highs.</p>
<p>After No. 120 Tianqiao was offered at a high of 58,000 yuan, there was strong demand from intermediaries, pushing the offer price up another 2,000 yuan. Subsequently, large firms covered short positions and sold at high prices, softening the market slightly. The morning session closed at 55,000 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors of a sharp jump in the black market for gold and cash stimulated sentiment. The over-the-counter market took the opportunity to push up prices, with retail investors actively buying. The market showed a uniformly high peak, with Tianqiao offered at 65,000 yuan and Dongyang at 67,000 yuan, significantly higher than the morning session.</p>
<p>The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk has not improved, and exports have not moved. Foreign firms are satisfied with their profits and have little interest in imports. Domestic sales initially showed strength due to rising yarn prices, but after hearing that the financial black market was rising again, the market became even stronger. Superior grade silk opened at 61,000 yuan in the morning and rose to 63,000 yuan at the close. The future trend is expected to remain buoyant, with the offer price increasing by another 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market initially rose and then fell yesterday. Sentiments among industry participants varied, and their targets differed. Credit conditions in the market tightened, and underground interest rates rose. Many speculators released goods to profit from interest, leading to continuous sales. The market was dominated by selling. After Meiya bedsheets opened at a high of 34,200 yuan, the rising momentum became too sharp. Large firms sold off at high prices, causing the market to decline immediately. Subsequently, after learning that the yarn market did not decline and that Chinese stocks rose, sentiment was restored. Prices then gradually rose slightly. Meiya closed at 33,200 yuan, and Huaqiang at 33,000 yuan, both higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Little Fluctuation in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market initially showed frequent excitement due to reports of easing credit conditions and the rebound of various goods outside the circle, leading to the sellers' intention to raise prices. The trend took on a different color. However, the buyers, considering that the funds have not yet been fully settled, coupled with an unwillingness to urgently seek high prices, suddenly softened the process, and the price has no ability to rise, but moved downstream step by step, and the final result at the end of the day was much the same as the previous day, without much ups and downs, and the trading continued to present a morning star state.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Since the tung oil trend turned from circuitous to virtual the day before, the market trend in the tung oil market yesterday suddenly became relaxed because of the easing of credit, so the goods holding mentality was suddenly pulled up, and the attitude recovered and sprouted to defend, so although the buying interest from all parties was still very small, the chassis was more stable than before, and the future has no signs of shaking.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Market Prices Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>The rising trend of cotton yarn has risen again, Cantonese transactions are active, people's minds are excited, and those who hold goods are unanimously optimistic, so yesterday's market conditions returned to a state of madness. Market prices skyrocketed. 42-count Blue Phoenix fell from 58,000 yuan to 56,000 yuan, and closed at 58,500 yuan at noon, a sharp increase of 8,500 yuan compared to the previous. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 8,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 45,500 yuan, reaching a high of 47,000 yuan in the middle, and closed at 46,500 yuan, up 6,500 yuan. 21-count Shuangma spot goods initially opened at a low of 38,000 yuan, with a maximum of 42,500 yuan, and closed at 41,500 yuan at noon, a final increase of 7,300 yuan, and factory orders at 37,500 yuan. 20-count Shuangma closed from 32,500 yuan to 34,500 yuan, an increase of 4,500 yuan. The 16-count and below grades all rose by about 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cloth market, with a slight easing of credit, the absorption of customers has become stronger, the buying wind is very strong, the trend has suddenly turned to fast profit, and market prices have risen slowly. The fine cloth stalls are quite active due to the fact that the spinning construction company has not been selling for a long time, resulting in a dry chip on the market. Longtou fine cloth initially saw a new high price of 1,550 yuan, although it was shouted down to 1,470 yuan in the middle, but it returned to 1,540 yuan at noon, resulting in a final increase of 190 yuan. Only Tianjin Factory 32 Wufu and Qingdao Factory Da Shuanglong were sold in the medium-grade fine cloth, and there was no supply of other products such as Laba Tong Wufu. Sijunzi Yuan Biji retreated from 1,400 yuan to a minimum of 1,360 yuan, and turned firm and strong at the end, ending with 1,420 yuan, up 180 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong started well, 170 yuan, and closed with 1,460 yuan for cloth. The factory's opening prices have mostly increased by about 100 yuan.</p>
<p>China Textile</p>
<p>China Textile yesterday sold nine kinds of yarns as usual, totaling 85 pieces, totaling 6,118,400 yuan. The approved prices were 19,400 yuan for 8-count Sunlight, 28,500 yuan for 15-count Fengnian, 29,100 yuan for 16-count Hongyue, 55,300 yuan for 32-count Double-strand Fengnian, 51,000 yuan for 40-count Hongbaoguang, 56,000 yuan for 42-count Double-strand Honglima, 57,000 yuan for 40-count Triple-strand Hongbaoguang, 76,000 yuan for 60-count Gongnu, and 175,000 yuan for 80-count Double-strand TK Caiqiu.</p>
<p>In addition, 62 pieces of 42-count double-strand Hongxiantao were sold on behalf of the US Aid Association, each piece at 58,000 yuan, totaling 3,596,000 Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, 201 pieces of 20-count yarn were additionally allocated on behalf of the Central Bank, with a total amount of 6,834,000 yuan. The prices of 20-count Jincheng, Jixiang, and Flying Tiger were all 34,000 yuan.</p>
