<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕監察院長于右任，廿六日下午于該院大會中以書面詳函一件致全體監委，請辭監察院長，該函係由大會主席劉哲宣讀，全體委員聞訊，有如晴天霹靂，咸表驚異，當即紛紛發言，一致表示挽留，並卽推定委員劉哲·于德純·唐鴻烈·谷鳳翔·呂超·冷曝東·陳漢珍·宋英。楊羣仙。崔震華。丘念台·李夢彪·曹浩森·劉平江·李正樂·馮雲仙等十六人前往于院長私邸，表示懇切挽留，面請打銷辭意，並將于院長辭職函退還。劉哲氏首謂，監院開會以來，大家都在興高彩烈，不料院長忽提出辭職，實無異投下了一顆炸彈。唐鴻烈·谷鳳翔·宋英·李正樂等亦均先後發言，謂監院正有賴院長之領導，今日時局艱難，院長實不可遽萌退志。于氏仍表示渠之辭職早在監院開會之前即已決定，所以未曾先提出者，乃因恐影響開會時同人之情緒，今會議已大體順利進行完畢，故特提出，請各同人另選賢能。至本人辭職，並非消極表示，乃因覺辭去院長以後，更易對國家有所貢獻，各委員等在于邸懇談廿分鐘，于氏仍未打消辭意，最後各監委再稱如院長不打銷辭意，則全體監委均將前來院長寓邸挽留，並願與院長同進退，言迄即將于氏辭職函退還，于氏連稱：「不能不能」，又置於桌上。唐鴻烈乃又將辭職函退至于氏手中，並稱：「院長打銷辭意了」，于氏再欲有所言時，唐等即於羣呼「打銷辭意」中紛紛起立吿辭，並於于氏之會客室門前向等候消息之記者說：「記者先生在此，院長已經打銷辭意了」。旋各監委代表即返院，向大會報吿已將院長辭職函退回，院長已打銷辭意，各監委聞訊後，均熱烈鼓掌，惟據秘書長李崇寶吿記者，于院長辭意甚堅，尙在繼續請辭中。于氏辭職原函如下：</p>
<p>于氏辭職原函</p>
<p>「敬啓者，右任承同人不棄，忝任院長，八越月來，國事之變化至大，人民之疾痛日深，本院之工作亦益爲艱鉅，雖竭盡愚鈍，無所裨益，乃知年衰多病，力與心遠，固不可以過事勉强之。今後促進和平，革新政治，尤須有大仁大勇之精神，以爲領導，而豈昏耄若愚者之所能堪，謹此具函懇辭院長職務，惟祈同仁以國家爲重，以工作之展聞爲重，而不以右任爲臨難苟免見責，惠允所請，則幸甚感甚，此上監察院卅八年度大會全體委負會鑒，于右任三月廿六日」。</p>

<p>〔本報蘭州廿六日電〕關於中蘇商約之談判，其草案現正分別呈請雙方政府批准中。唯該項方案之內容甚爲各方關注，本報記者頃自半官方但絕對可靠人士處獲知梗概，據該人士透露：該項草案分兩部份，一爲中蘇新疆通商貿易條約，一爲中蘇新疆經濟合作協定，前者側重通商之按術問題，後者爲中蘇合作對全疆工礦資源開發之辦怯，包括新疆省境之石油·鈾·煤·鐵·金·銀等。記者詢以該項方案之基本精神？據答：在張治中將軍善隣親蘇之一貫主張下，此一協定爲絕對平等互惠者，且幕內人氏相信對新疆民生及中蘇友好均有裨益。記者繼詢該項商談如獲成功後，是否可能改善新疆特殊局面（指伊寗方面放棄對立態度），該人士答稱：當　然！</p>
<h3>對英行高價拋售銀元　監委提出糾正案　請政府另訂本有效有力辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕監院所派唐鴻烈胡文暉兩委員分赴京·滬兩地調查央行高價拋售銀元一案，業經提出糾正案，該案於說明調查經過後稱：政府軍政各費支出浩繁，收支無法相抵，通貨膨賬，物價上漲，勢爲必然之結果，如以拋售政策籌劃軍費，則政府金銀物資爲數有限，何足以資絕注。如以拋售政策平抑物價，打擊投機，其效果亦屬渺小，厥揆原因，約有五端：（一）人民對金圓券信用喪失，（二）一般投機家觀察敏銳，技術高明，手段厲害，對官塲情形亦復熟悉，政府一切辦法，均不能逃出其魔掌·（三）各銀行錢莊夥同一氣，咸以政府爲對象。（四）上海軍政機關林立，大批款項領到後，實有整箱未動之鈔票轉入市塲，變爲投機資本。　各銀行錢莊常以化整爲零，化零爲整之辦法，操縱金銀市塲，此種行莊及經紀人是否有豪門作背量，頗有疑問。基於上述各別原因，該行拋售政策與其說打擊投機，母寗說是助長投機，增加投機資本，結果適得其反。至三月十八。十九兩日所拋售之銀元，價格一律爲七千元，雖低於當日上海之市價，但較諸南京及其他各地爲高，由此刺激各地物價上漲，難免不造成嚴重之後果。况政府所掌握之金銀物資外匯，爲數有限，一拋再拋，造成國庫空虛，宋子文時代拋金政策之失敗，可爲殷鑒。總之，央行此種飲鴆止渴，抱薪救火之冒險辦法，不惟不能補救財政困難，平抑物價波動，其結果將加速財政破產，助長投機力量，使各地物價因普遍投機而更加高漲，展望將來，危機實大，特提出糾正案，請由院轉函行政院，迅即另訂有效有力政策辦法，以爲根本之計。</p>
<h3>板橋鎮北投部隊　證實僅五六十人</h3>
<p>大部紛紛整隊南歸</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕在江寗鎭附近板橋鎭駐防之第九七師一部份，廿五日藉過江出擊爲名，在江北橋林鎭突引師北向，投往共軍。此項消息，廿六日業經官方證實，惟情勢毫不嚴重，該師師長王晏淸，出身軍校六期，陸大十五期，爲第十八軍之老幹部，其部隊向稱精銳，素質極佳，忠貞不拔。王率部北去時，各部發覺王之企岡，紛紛整隊南返，故王僅率其參謀長一人，副團長二人，及士兵五六十人，向烏江方面逸去。板橋鎭平靜無事，防務亦極鞏固。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕據海軍總部廿六日晚八時接安慶方面電告，安慶城仍在國軍手中，內平靜無事，國車現與共軍在郊外原陳地相持同度被共軍攻陷之襲王廟陳地業經國軍收復安慶江面泊有海軍盤艇多艘，以猛烈火砲米射擊，共軍攻勢被阻，毫無進展。</p>

<h3>由鈔荒談到銀玩儲蓄</h3>
<p>— 何師琦</p>
<p>金圓券今日雖已到了無人垂青的地步，但是鈔荒問題，依然能撼動了整個的社會。這因爲金圓券還是當前交易的媒介，所以才使每個人感到切　之痛。實則今日的鈔荒問題，是信用過度膨脹下的必然產物，當局旣無釜底抽並把的辦法，又要國盧通貨的惡性膨脹，全力扼緊發行；睡在這種矛盾不安的狀態下，因之通貨的數量，便難以適應實際的需要，而鈔荒問題，也隨之無法根本解決了。</p>
<p>信用膨脹，應該用節省國庫支出和緊縮信用的方法去解決，縱在一時緊縮發行，絕非永久良好的政策；況且銀行欠了人民的債務，沒有備足了現鈔庫存，單是濫開不能付現的「空頭」本票，除了人發忍受貼水的無名損失之外，在法理上也是欠妥的。尤其可笑的，是若干銀行在開出本票的時候，更自作聽明的在本票上加蓋橫綫，以便作爲拒絕付現的理由。然而這根本也是不合法的；因爲本票非同支票可比，它的本身卽是Cahier's．Order，規定爲付現的憑單，翻遍我國的票據法，並找不到本票可以加蓋橫綫　的條文。</p>
<p>鈔荒問題的　結，旣係在於信用的膨脹，所以單用發行的方法，是解決不了的。默罕最近中央銀行搭發銀元的辦法，不外是避免增發新的通貨和利用過去收藏的銀元，代替現鈔籌碼，以解除暫時鈔荒。但是這樣便疏忽了若干技術問題：第一，中央銀行所搭發的銀元中，有　洋，港洋，龍洋，袁頭洋，孫頭洋和各省鑄造的雜洋，成色旣不一律同，價格又相　　，照當時市塲上的情形看來，除了袁頭洋價格在七千元以上，其他的價格，都比較的小，甚至每枚有差到一二千元的，試問人民是否鶴担負這種意外的損失？第二，果真中央銀行要想難持每枚七千元的牌價，而使銀元不分版式地暢快的流通的話，必須在一方面發出銀元，一方面設法收進銀元；如儘管一味的只出不進，試問人發誰又吃得起這種眼前　？再說，發出每枚約合金圓券七千元的銀元，籌碼的增大，一定是想像中事。當局旣不能在節省開支和緊縮信用上下工夫，那麼必須要有一種根本收縮通體內，安定人心的工具，才能防止鈔荒的再度發生。</p>
<p>關於銀元的身份問題，當局旣規定准許銀元流通買賣於前，又搭發銀元於後，所以我們絕對有理由認爲它是和金圓券並行的一種貨幣。雖然當局迤今還沒有正工宣佈出來，上海金管局且曾局部的否定了銀元的的貨幣身份，但是我們如放眼看看全國，則大勢所趨，銀元顯然已成了主要的通貨。廣州·福州·昆明·重慶·成都·長沙·漢口·九江及各地鄉村裏，那一宗交易不是用銀元？蘭州·昆明·長沙等地銀行的存放款業務，不都已用了銀元作單位嗎，中央造幣廠和甘肅籌錢局不都是在趕工製造銀元嗎？我們再撤開代表民意的立委丘漢平等氏提議發行銀元及銀元券的話不談，雲南·四川等省政府承認銀元爲通貨的話（申報成都廿三日電）也不談，重慶參議會發行銀元的議案更不談，我們且說新任財政部長兼中央銀行總裁的劉攻芸氏，不是也在計劃發行兌現的銀元券與金圓券同時流通嗎？（金融日報廿三日南京專電）根據這許多的事實，所以我們敢肯定的說，今後的銀元，當然已具備貨幣的身份。</p>
<p>此外，現在這有部份學者，以理論爲根據，反對銀元的流通。他們認爲銀元本位在貨幣原理上是落伍的幣制，白銀價格容易受到國際市塲上的激　，可是他們抹殺了銀元潛在的流通偏愛性（Lipuidity　Prefererence)。今日國內人民普　的愛好銀元，是衆所週知的，雖然政府曾幾次三想禁止他們使用，但是始終未能見效，反而盛行更廣，這足見他們的偏愛癖，絕非任何人所能故意造成的。事實如此，一切只能遷就事實，因勢利導。若論防止國際市塲波動的牽涉，只要　格限制白銀進出口，也就可以了。至於銀元和金圓券同時流通的問題，也不乏先例　可援。像Irving　Fisher所提倡的貨物金元（Goods　Dollar)，十九世紀以前歐美盛行的金銀複本位制（Bemetalic　Standard），第一次歐戰時德國的舊馬克和蘭登馬克，蘇聯大革合後的盧布和Chervonetz，以及我國民初時的「兩」「元」並用等情形，在經濟上的功能，也並不爲小，且也和我國目前的情形類多相似。總之，吾人不反對任何理論，但是理論似宜適應環境，才能有效，否則，強用不合國情的理論，不是削足適履的話，也就恐「橘逾淮而爲枳」了。</p>
<p>然則銀元儲蓄是適合當前各界一致迫切的要求，中央銀行若要避免受人責難，收回已經搭發的銀元，何不循着這一條途徑，以達成調節通貨·收縮通貨·緊縮信用·穩定物價的作用呢？要知人民在飽經通貨膨脹之禍的今日，誰不希冀能獲得一種何持　買力不變的工具，來維護自己的產業？只要我們財金當軸的政策不要朝三暮四，一再變更，銀元儲蓄本身的烏夜啼要再落到公債·黃金儲蓄·和美金儲蓄那樣悲慘的遭遇，則人民的剩餘購買力，以及非社會經濟所需要的通貨，自必由儲蓄的方式而重入政府的手中。再說，通貨回籠以後，新的通貨就不再需要繼續發行，社會上原有的通貨也可以陸續的收回，政府借用了這批鉅額的儲蓄，彌補赤字，豈不勝過用担保品向國外去借得外幣的債務嗎？</p>
<p>辦理銀元儲蓄時，旣可收回了大批的通貨，那麼以後的現鈔籌碼情形，是否比現在更嚴重呢？關於這個問題，我以爲並不一定。因爲銀元儲蓄是一個比較穩定的單位，它不像現在金圓券值的動盪，人民把錢存在銀行裏，旣可生息，又不需担負風驗，更有誰願意把現款擱在家裏呢？這樣人民自不會携了現款去做交易，銀行的存款，也不致過而不留，存款的流轉速率，也一定不致像現在這樣的迅速，信用自然會無形的緊縮，儲蓄對於流通籌碼，自然也會發生一種節制的作用。再說，市塲上的現鈔，卽使發生恐慌的話，只要把已吸收的現鈔或銀元放出一部份去調劑，也就足以應付裕如了。</p>
<p>最後，我們以爲目前中央銀行所搭發的銀元，雖然是變像的大鈔，不過因爲它的本身有實值，所以它的價值決不會隨金圓券而貶落的，充其量也不過如Greshan's　Law所表示的退而藏之罷了。所以我以爲不必過份的担心，但政府在目前金圓券，銀元並發的時候，必須從速提倡銀元儲蓄，使游資獲得正當的歸宿，否則戰事一日不停生產一日不與則不管發出多少的金圓全體銀元也難填社會的慾　，而鈔荒問題，依然是不易澈底解決的。（卅八，三，廿四，於上海·）</p>

<h3>蘇與伊朗關係惡化封閉駐伊境領事署三處</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕權威方面息：蘇聯政府正從事封閉在伊朗境內大不列士。梅許特。及魯亞士三地之領事署。由於新聞檢查嚴格，故此項消息尚未自伊朗傳出。據外交界專電稱，蘇聯已在搬移該三地蘇領事館中之什物，惟為電並未說明蘇方此舉是否卽爲正式封閉領事署。</p>
<p>外交界相信，蘇聯如正式關閉其在伊朗之領事館，則不久必將要求伊朗政府關閉其設在蘇聯境內唯一的領事館－馬庫伊領事館。此間相信蘇聯次一行動，與蘇聯政府最近的政策有兩點相連：（一）蘇聯不斷對伊朗施用壓力，指其與美英勾結。美國務卿艾契遜最近會譴責蘇聯此項行爲，而美英發言人復同時聲明兩國對伊朗安全所惑之深刻興趣。（二）蘇聯歸近決定大事減少外國駐在蘇境之外交人員，懷疑彼等在蘇從事間諜活動。此間人士雖不擬揣測蘇聯政府之行動，但不一般均信在短期內大約尚不致與伊朗斷絕外交關係，撤銷其駐德黑蘭大使館。</p>

<h3>無頭碎屍案獲新路綫警局接到告密信兩進　正秘密處理短期內當有重大進展</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市謹記路無頭碎屍案自廿一日發現起，直至昨晚止，其間有關該案之各種綫索，人證，物證等本報記者均儘量搜集，並曾連續刊載，一方面爲讀者作忠實報導，他方面亦欲使全部材料能有助於當局偵查工作之進行。惟昨日本報接獲響局發言人陳天三電話，謂該案偵查工作現已在具體展開，爲使保持機密，俾可於最短期內完成緝凶破案，故希望本報對該案暫停連載。主辦該案之常熟警分局方面，昨起亦已由分局長程義寬，副分局長王思祖論令全體承辦警員務須秘密從事，並嚴禁對外透露任何消息。</p>
<p>但據記者獲得確息：前晚警局方面公佈懸息：前晚警局方公佈懸賞獎勵通風報信，昨午後卽有人持密報信兩垚主，送往常然路警分局告密，該兩函對本案之偵查，當有極大幫助，卽由程分局長親自秘密核閱及決定處理辦法·相信短時期內，必因此而有重大進展。</p>
<p>再綜觀該案截至昨晚止，各種綫索，千頭萬緒，警局迄未能將其理清，故偵查工作雖已動員大批警務人員積極進行，但目前仍逗留於最初步階段·按命案最主要之偵查路綫，據某一從事實際偵緝工作並對犯罪學深具經騐者對記者談：不外選　確定被害人身份，而碎屍案迄目前止，死者身份仍未明瞭，而該局仍未能確定或否定該兩案之是否確具連帶性。</p>
<h3>外科權威　經驗之談</h3>
<p>根據本報記者昨晚與本市某素被認爲我國外科權威之醫師談，在普通情形下，倘無適當工具（如鋸·利刀等），支解屍體之結果，決不能如該案中各肉塊之整齊光潔，據該醫師談，倘　屍體骨節無刀劈之裂痕，則可決定必係鋸解無疑。該外科專家又云：在普通手術間情形下，將屍體解爲卅二塊，倘有助手，看護等配備，大約需時三小時以上，倘一人單獨工作，而以不慌不忙之手法從事，則可能需五六小時。本案屍體內臟旣已割去，而肉塊又皆洗滌清凈，故可能有數人同謀，而非一人所爲。此外問題，如女襖之來歷，尺寸，包袱上有無泥潰及其他有無可爲綫索之跡象，迄昨晚尚無可靠之答覆。又據警局研究：包裏屍體之油包等，皆顯示距拋棄前時間並不太長，因此，可能證實犯案地址必距山東會館不遠，而目前調查，尚未能發覺在附近地段內有無失踪男子；而碎屍案最耐人尋味者，卽內臟及頭顱，始終尚未發見，兇手旣能暗藏或毀減內臟及頭顱，則又何必將屍體之其他部分拋棄在普非秘密之處。又據該偵查命案有經騐者談：山東會館長工李長安（卽於廿日清晨發現棄屍者）之閃燦其詞，亦該案之一大謎底，李之迴避情形，倘出諸恐懼心，則此種心理必有其原因。</p>
<h3>「命案必敗露」的實現有賴市民與報紙協助</h3>
<p>前述之犯罪學專家並回憶十餘年前，本市曾發生一轟動全市之國際性箱屍案，當時被害者爲一年青貌美之中國女性，屍體係塞入一旅行箱中，卓越名由日本郵船運往長崎，當時本市尚在租界時代，主辦該案者，卽發動全體偵緝人員，追尋當時運旅行箱之人力車或汽車，經數星期之調查，終將該人力車經某報記者之手，並由人力車夫互助會之恊且而發現，最後破案，卽根據此一關鍵；自人力車夫口中探出犯罪之地點，因而查得居住　該處及失踪之人物，偵查人員卽根據此綫索而捕得該案主犯葡萄牙人雷米蒂亞斯Remedios．雷米直認箱屍案係渠所爲，並又承認係因嫉妬而情殺。當時該案自發現屍體至破案止，爲時凡四十餘日，主辦該案之偵查人員，在全案毫無進展之苦悶過程中，皆時刻牢記西諺：「命案必敗露」一語，沉着應付，終告破案。據該犯罪學專家言：碎屍案偵查尚在初步時期，將來偵緝工作必將遇到不少難關，惟有在市民及報紙之協助下，「命案必敗露」之諺，可望再度實現也。</p>
<h3>市長借現鈔發公教薪津　決於月底前發竣總數約達三十億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公教人員本月份薪津，財政局正積極籌劃中，決於月底前趕撥完竣。其倍數定六七五倍，爲上期月中二二五倍之三倍，卽本月份總計發九百倍。吳市長爲現時現銷缺乏，昨午特與中央銀行總裁劉攻芸通電話，請其儘量籌集：估計總數頗鉅，約有三十億之譜。財政局副局長錢健夫表示：不論本市經濟情形如何困難，員工薪津務將設法籌齊。於月底以前發竣。</p>
<p>又據記者統計所得：自中央公務人員調整待遇辦法公佈後，本市公教人員卽可按照主計處月終發表之指數倍數調整。該項指數係依當地生活指數爲根據者，如以本期生活指數爲根據者，如以本期生活指數一三三九倍計算，則市長之底薪爲八百元，經打折扣後爲一五八元，每月可得二十一萬餘元。局長平均得十八萬四千餘元，科長得十五萬八千餘元，科員僅得八萬餘元。除固定薪水外，　任級以上者，均領有辦公費。據悉：市長之辦公費約等於一個半科長之薪津，局長之辦公費，等於一個科長之薪津，科長之辦公費約等於一個科員之薪津。而普通科員則除薪津外，一無所有。唯資彌補者，爲實物配給約合金圓三萬元。此外尚有福利米二斗，合一萬元。水電津貼約一萬二千元。</p>
<h3>市長親自接見市立中小代表　答覆所提三點要求薪金實無力再增發</h3>

<h3>國校商妥透支經費　週內按九百倍撥付作爲預發下月薪金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公教生活指數尚未發表，公教人員在此物價高漲而待遇問題未有解決之辦法下，生活均遭受嚴重威脅。本市各國立大專學校教職員薪金，二月份係按七十五倍發放。三月初教部發放五百倍，教授聯誼會認爲此係補發二月份之數，此後卽未再有分文發下。至今學校經費與教職員學生生活均已至枯竭無法維持之境。本市各國立大專學校校長章益·王之卓·夏堅白·朱國璋等，昨日上午特聯袂赴中央銀行商洽透支經費問題。因教部遠在廣州，透支標凖等難以確定，經與央行業務局長林崇墉商定暫按八一九標凖之九百倍透支，於本週內撥付。各校等領得此款後，卽按九百倍發放教職員工薪金，作爲預發四月份薪金之一部份。</p>
<p>據校長方面談稱：現今學生公費，工友底薪及教授學術研究費之底薪均已增加。故央行依八一九之標凖九百倍透支，各校按現行底薪發放時祇合七百餘倍，不敷之數，校長方面尚需另行張羅。現教授會方面認爲三月份薪金尚分文未發，校長方面認爲二月份已發七十五倍，三月份已發五百倍，但均待按指數補足。此一問題急盼中央速作整個解決。</p>

<h3>經濟無烟爐灶短期內問世　試騐家許炒菜煑飯全日用煤約十六磅　尚有若干缺點正在研究改進</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「經濟無烟爐灶」，這是一個多麼誘惑人的名字，在今日中國尚不能完全利用電力的時候，每一個家庭中烹飪，烘烤，煑水大概都仰賴煤爐，因此每一家庭中都有一個大的或小的煤爐，可是煤爐有兩個缺點；（一）煤氣太重，（二）耗煤太多，這兩個問題瑞在經中央工業試騐所解決了。記者昨天訪問該所，對經濟無烟爊二的設計原理，構造，和使用方法，作一度詳盡的考察，茲報道於次：</p>
<p>該爐的目的，在能直接燃用價格低廉的烟煤，使得完全燃燒，而無煤烟發生，并充分利用煤之熱能及廢氣餘熱，以提高爐灶燃燒效率爲主。其他如木柴及無烟煤亦可用作此種爐灶的燃料，而得良好的效果。</p>
<p>如何才能達到這個目的呢？當烟煤在爐中燃燒時，必定具備四個要點：</p>
<p>經濟無烟爐灶設圖案</p>
<p>（一）足量出氣供給，（二）空氣與可燃氣體之密切混合接觸，（三）維持爐膛於煤氣着火溫度，（四）足够之蒸　及燃燒時間，關於爐灶設計原理，比較深奧在略去不談，先講一講該項爐灶的構造使用的方法：</p>
<p>（一）生火時先將少許木柴紙片置搖動爐柵（見附K）上燃着，約三分鐘後將少量煤加於其上，歡十五分鐘後煤火憶旺，再另將一部份煤置於斜爐柵（J）上。</p>
<p>（二）爐柵（K）上之煤有經灰門（I）進入之主級空氣及經（L）門進入之二級空氣混　合而助燃燒，此二級空氣經夾墻（M）時爲爐膛高溫所預熱，而增進燃燒效率。</p>
<p>（三）爐柵（J）上之煤爲由加煤門（H）進入之空氣及一部份由灰門進入之主空氣及爐膛輻射之高溫，使煤中之揮發物質全部徐徐蒸餾而出，並使與出夾墻（M）中下行之預熱空氣混合，而得完全燃燒，致無煤烟發生。</p>
<p>（四）高溫燃氣先與鍋（A）及開水罐（B）及湯罐（C）接觸，使達足够溫度以炒菜及煑開水燉湯外，并使其輕過熱水箱（F），利用其餘熱以熱水。同時烘箱（E）之左方及上部因受高溫輻射熱之傳遞，使其內部溫度足供烘烤麵包及冬季作保溫菜蔬之用，爊二右上方之平豪（D）可供置燒菜飯時廚房之必需器具之用。</p>
<p>（五）出灰時僅需於灰門（I）外用一長钩將爐柵（K）往復搖動，卽使煤灰自行落於灰室，同時並使斜爐柵上已成焦塊之煤落於（K）上，繼續燃燒。新鮮煤可另加於斜爐柵之上部，繼續其蒸餾作用，斜爐柵之小孔係上小下大之圓錐形，卽用碎煤亦不致阻塞。</p>
<p>（六）煴火時只須加一層薄濕碎煤於煤火上部，並將烟囪下方隔板（圖上未示出）關小，同時將加煤門及灰門進氣孔關小，並將二級空氣門（L）之進氣孔關閉，卽可隔夜不熄。</p>
<p>（七）燃用森柴時方法亦同。</p>
<p>該所設計後，歷經試騐，成績均甚美滿。第一次試騐以烟煤連續燃燒八小時，均無烟發生，煤之燃燒量每小時爲三磅。第二次試騐仍用烟煤作實際家庭炒菜煑飯之間斷試騐，不用時卽行　火，用時再加煤試騐，如此全日用煤僅十六磅。第三次用木柴試騐，全日用柴約二十二磅。</p>
<p>此項經濟無烟爐灶之設計者爲顧毓瑔，陳學俊兩氏，該所因經費太少，試騐工作深受影響，據該所負責人稱：此項煤爐尚有若干缺點，正在研究改進中，如體積太大，（約小型寫字　大小），携帶搬運不便，刻正研究儘可能縮小，而不妨碍燃燒效率，俟形式及內部均感滿意後，最短期間將該項爐灶圖肅繪好，大量製造問世。</p>

<h3>袍哥們的天下　重慶的一樁地皮公案</h3>
<p>— 萊公</p>
<p>〔重慶廿一日航訊〕重慶在這勸亂時期，好像巳是袍哥們的天下了·他們公開打死了人，又開始向法院鬥法。這案子起因於重慶世界佛敎大同會的地皮糾紛，在袍哥與大同會的夾縫中間，代替大同會犧牲了性命的是謝德芝。謝氏居渝市已歷百年，其老父以和平慈善爲衆稱道，年近九旬，於前年才逝世。謝本人今年五十餘歲，有子女十餘人。俱在大·中·小學肄集·他是渝市目前唯一能鑒別珠寶的專家·生平熱心公益，篤信佛學。自參加大同會後，曾不惜以一己之時間及金錢，襄助會務。該會的理事長是潘昌猷，副理事長是杜岷英，理事尙有居正等，謝亦爲其中之一，並界以總幹事之職</p>
<p>大同會地皮的前身是東嶽廟，抗戰時被敵機夷爲平地，鄰近住戶，便紛紛擴充地盤，附近的一川戲院，便佔了一大幅，光陰似箭，說來已經十年了，政府還都後，大同會決議，要建築蓮師殿，舊事重提，要收回地皮，不能不交由身任理事而兼總幹事的謝氏去承當，謝氏口頭催遷各住戶無效，又被推派負責起訴的事，最後，算是完全勝訴了。不幸住戶之中，幾乎全是當地袍哥，而且有好幾位是首屈一指的大爺，以是經怯院强制執行四次都無結果。這魷謝氏說來，無論對袍哥及大同會兩方面，都沒有討到好。而在袍哥的一方面言，簡則就是爲這次種下死因，他們認爲這一切經過，都是謝氏一己的主張。而所有經過，未免太顧了他們的面子。影響了他們平時無法無天的社會地位。千方百計，要對他個人加以報復，而有錢有勢的一川戲院，此次魷負起這領導報復的責任。一川董事長蔣相臣是市參議員。總經理載坤元是退伍團長。副經理牟德彰是大股東，現正在該院演武戲京戲的厲家班老板厲是之。是江湖中堅。這四位之中，兇手主角戴坤元精技擊，原在楊森部下。後倒戈而投范紹增，范氏退伍後，他亦失業。在行伍時，因性行粗暴不講理，別號毛牛，他現在有一大批舊日范部的散兵游勇。再加以袍哥的雙重資格。在重慶是最吃得開的第一號惡霸。而一川經理的頭銜，因此也落在他頭上。對方這一個陣容，無形之中，巳足够是對謝氏的一個重大威脅，那知戴牟將三人，硬是挺身而出，不是到謝氏家裏去恐嚇辱駡，就是在大同會講經之際。直接闖進滋擾。並託人帶信，申言要將謝氏置之死地。謝氏本極坦白，但爲了親朋之勸，爲此曾經有好幾次去省外躲避了好些時日。這一次謝氏返家不久，一川方面忽然派人向謝氏說情，願自動讓出原佔地皮。另租用其他地皮，迨雙方租約手續完成，該戲院不但原地未讓。且督率工人在剛才爲大同會收回而已下定石基的地皮上。搭蓋厲家班宿舍。這當然是和謝氏正面爲難·但謝氏亦祇敢怒而不敢言。</p>
<p>二月十四日（農歷正月十七日）謝氏於午後四點鐘，照例去大同會聽講佛經。剛坐不久，住戶許進修王銀昌二人。闖進經堂，催促謝氏出外，謂有事相商，一路推拖，到了許氏屋內，忽然打聲四起，前門退路，一齊遮斷，首由兇手戴坤元，以左手擒住謝氏領口。以右手先打謝氏兩耳光。再連績猛擊左太陽穴及耳根等處。謝氏剛合掌　出：「戴大爺請饒恕我」。就跳出另一主兇牟德彰，緊執謝氏兩手，以腳猛踢謝氏下部，其餘帮兇拳足齊發，爭相狙擊，一時擾嚷，和呻吟之聲，驚動了室外的兩個工人，情知不妙，飛跑到經堂，狂呼救命，及聽經的人把謝氏拖至經堂時，已成半死狀態，那知兇手戴坤元，復率衆跟踪而來，高喝要將人打死，衆經友各各向他打躬合掌，苦苦哀求，方才作罷，這時謝氏已不能言語，經友們看看情形，怕有性命關係，乃伴送到怯院去報案，並騐傷，迨返家後，中西醫僉以頭部血管溢血，各各束手無怯，醫院亦以傷勢無救，拒不收容，在此期間，戴，牟，蔣等，復正式派人去謝家打聽，究竟死未，其家中人經此騷擾不安，病者已感到左半身全部麻木。乃再托人情。勉强送入寬仁醫院。至二月二十一日晨七時，果因傷逝世，家人乃將尸體暫移大同會停放。該會的人都激動得哭出來。馬上招待新聞界，並代尸屬擬具訴狀，將兇手戴牟蔣等七人列入被吿，由尸屬披蔴戴孝面呈法院，叩請法官，騐尸拘兇，一時怯庭之內，尸屬的哭聲，與羣衆的吵鬧聲嚷成一片。當由推事升庭，向尸屬說：「原吿既已死去，並已由地檢處，派員騐屍。本案自有檢察官，按怯偵查辦理」。旋即退庭。次日渝市各報，爭相披露，轟動了整個山城。且說屍屬在出庭後，滿以爲有人來騐屍，終未見來，經向法院催問，答稱明天才能來。次日（廿二日）等候終日，仍無結果，直到第三天（廿三日）騐屍員才來了，但他約略一看之後，也不塡示傷單，便畏畏縮縮的溜走了。　屍屬氣得無怯，自動僱人把傷處拍了，四大張照片，查得死者左面部完全黑腫，巳不像人形。左胸部重傷全靑。週身四肢，靑紫不一，腎囊下垂如碗大，看來十分慘然。在廿二日那一天，兇手戴某等，一眼看見各報刋出於己不利的消息，便着了慌，立刻在當天，擺上二十幾席，遍請渝市各界，常塲以袍哥的口吻，把言語拿順，於是有幾位大爺，出面爲死者購衣衾棺木，並稱係以第三者的立塲，掏自己腰包墊付的。同時又經常至謝家說軟說硬。願代屍屬去募化生活費，祇要能撤回　　訴訟，接受和解。而兇手　某一仍在做他的總經理，戲院一仍照常開　演唱。所不同者是戲院大門，經常集合了不少衣履不整的所謂在鄕軍人，據說是爲募化生活費而來借住的。直到法院將該案移　刑庭辦理。　再度開庭時，被吿攔內，還是虛無一人，結果庭上又宣佈以被吿既未傳到，應改期再訊而退庭。轉瞬已是半月，屍屬眼見一個個的兇手，仍是招搖過市。死者未葬，生者無依，乃拖兒帶女，奔向婦女協會去哭訴。剛巧「三八」節到臨，常天下午，不約而來的婦女，以及大同會的人們，形成了一羣遊行的隊伍，由屍屬捧着靈位領先。直赴綏靖公署，警備司令部，地方法院，上請願書。沿途並呼口號，貼傳單。當日全城的人，幾乎都把這事作爲談話資料。但奇怪的是，所有傳單隨貼隨撕，而且撕得乾乾淨凈。更奇怪的是，這一條轟動全市直叩衙門的新聞，直到第二天，只有一二家報紙才吞吞吐吐的提說了兩句。好容易三月十六日下午三點鐘，怯院才又開庭，但是祇偵訊被吿，庭上高聲傳喚兇手戴坤元，牟德彰等姓名，都沒有回聲，也不見人影。只有被吿中主謀的一川董事長蔣相臣，參議員等一·二人，到庭應詢，而隨身湧來的袍哥倒有一百餘人，立刻把法庭塞得水洩不通。這個緊張塲面，在半小時內，就宣吿結束退庭。蔣某又被袍哥們呼擁而出，泰然的步入一輛自備的汽車，疾馳而去。此案的下文聽說要看三月廿八日開庭的結果了。本報記者</p>
<h3>看川西農村　談限田政策</h3>
<p>— 本報記者周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都十八日航訊〕時局動盪，人心看變，革新政治，成爲全民一致要求，尤其土地改革，更是當前的迫切需要。上月張翠返蓉，發表施政方針，特別强調實施「土改」，作爲重建西南重點；川省府本此，上週通過實施「四川限田政策」，這在今天的四川社會環境下，未始不是一件勇敢而富有戰鬥性「革命」行動。</p>
<p>川西繁榮農民血汗</p>
<p>春暖花開，記者爲了實地調查農村眞况，特地走馬到蓉郊各縣瀏覽一番；川西平原是可愛的，這幾天，春已漸深，草木滋榮，綠舖麥野，黄滿菜畦，烟林村落，遠近映帶，農夫餉婦，縱橫隴畝·從現在起，辛勤的農人，已經開始耕耘，點點血汗，造成天府倉庫—成都平原的繫榮。這些農人，大都是受僱於地主的佃農，終歲勤苦，難求一飽。同時由於頻年內戰，捐多賦重，地主中的中小地主，所獲亦難維持生活被迫變賣田地，於是發生土地集中現象，因而產生若干新興的大地主。據精確調查：近十年來，川西平原新興地主戶數，佔地主總戶數百分之七十一，佔田百分之八十九。變動最大的大邑，新地主戶數佔總戶數百分八十八，佔田竟達百分之九十九。</p>
<p>土地集中農民困苦</p>
<p>從記者最近訪問的少數縣份，發現川西土地其中的特殊現象，如大色：新地主比例，軍人地主以百分之二。九的戶數，佔百分之六十六的田地，每戶平均佔田四千畝，最高四萬餘畝‘官僚地主戶數佔百分之四十七，佔田百分之卅三，平均佔田二百畝，最高九千餘畝。舊地主祇剩百分之十二，佔田百分之一弱。又如崇慶，某新興大地主田地，奄有長廿里寬四十里大半縣境的面積。統計川西平原田地，百分之六十轉移集中在軍閥地主手中，百分之卅分散於官僚，土豪，劣紳。推究原因，川西水利修明，歲少荒歉，一般認爲田地是最穩妥的投資對象，軍閥官僚歷年搜刮居積的非法利得，遂集中於購買田地。這些大地主由於田地衆多，財力雄厚，同時利用政治上，社會上的種種惡勢力，對所有佃農的壓榨欺凌，無所不用其極，川西農民的血淚，眞是一篇慘無人道的傷心史</p>
<p>省府實施限田辦法</p>
<p>川省府爲順應潮流需要，針對此種事實，擬定了「四川省限田辦法」，要點：（一）全川私人土地或團體所有土地面積，實行限田徵收。（二）一戶人口，以一家五口爲準，並以永久共同生活之家屬爲限。（三）田畝劃分，以每市畝年產穀四市石以上者爲上等田，三市石以上者爲中等田，不滿三市石者爲下等田。並以每市畝年產小麥一市石五市斗者爲上等地，一市石以上者爲中等地，不滿一市石爲下等地。（四）限額，田，每戶不得超過上等田五十市畝，或中等田七十市畝，或下等田二百市畝。地，每戶不得超過上等地七十五市畝，或中等地一百市畝，或下等地一百五十市畝。（五）一戶人口超過五人，每超過一人，得增加限額畝數十分之一。（六）徵收之超額土地，應即實行重劃，改編後，分別授予承領耕作之人民，其順序：（一）現耕種人，（二）原承耕之農民，（三）有耕作能力之本藉退役士兵及現役士兵之家屬，（四）其他有耕作能力需要土地之農民。（七）徵收超額土地之地價，以土地債券搭配現金，分期補償之·</p>
<p>川西農民普遍覺醒</p>
<p>「四川限田辦法」的施行，在今天尙不爲當局明智及時之舉。不深入四川農村，不知道四川農民的偉大，八年抗戰，三年內爭，兵源糧賦，四川農民爲國家負荷艱鉅，記者看川西農村，從這裏意味到中華民族從忍勞忍怨中爭取光榮生存的特性，繁捐重賦，納丁服役，他們爲盡國民義務，從無怨言。而由不合理的土地集中，產生軍閥官僚新地主，利用舊社會下的保甲，豪劣，哥老等惡勢力，對農民壓榨剝削，四川農民在這極度惡劣環境中，默默地忍受了幾十年。但這次接觸的結果，證明他們是覺醒了，從二五减租到限田政策，川西農民正在普遍地主動爭取，川省府頒佈的辦法，不過是順應潮流的一種舉動，萬一連此也口惠而實不至，其後果將恐難明言了。</p>

<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>蘇州孤兒院收養五載　流浪兒重回漫暖之家</h3>
<p>……本報社會服務又一收穫……</p>
<p>大概半個月以前，本欄接到一位未署名的讀者來書，說有孤兒嚴根發，現年十一歲，五年前被拐子從上海騙到蘇州，後遇警察查問，拐十逸去，他就由吳縣浸會孤兒院收容，但記得其父在上海開有花舖，生母早已去世·要求本攔設法探訪他的家長，使能重回溫暖之家。　本欄接信以後，當天魷展開了調查工作，我們拘着一片熱忱，去追求「服務之果」。</p>
<p>第一步我們從蘇州謝衙前五十六號私立吳縣浸會孤兒院盛院長那裏，探悉嚴根發係卅三年夏天入院，操崇明口音，當初是在蘇州觀前醋坊橋堍做乞丐，非常可憐，後由附近黄順泰酒店老闆轉託毛上珍印刷所主人毛書雲送院留養，已五年於茲，現在小學二年級讀書。他的父親名叫嚴生弟，在上海開設花舖，牌號叫做「時景」，地點却不淸楚。並承該院檢送新近所攝的照片一幀。</p>
<p>後來我們再從上海市花樹商業同業公會方面探悉重慶南路一五四號有一家「時新」花店，店主姓倪名勝其，正和所要調查的目標，其音相似。接着我們魷抱着滿腔希望前往訪問。</p>
<p>當記者將跑到離重慶南路不遠的十字路口，一輛中型吉普軍車飛駛擦身而過，眞是一幕驚險的鏡頭。在鬧市裏車行速度原有規定的限制，而不幸的市民却往往犧牲在這般不守法的司機手裏！</p>
<p>走進時新花店，找着了倪勝其君，一詢之下，果然是倪君之子。倪君以失蹤五年的孩子，一旦獲悉其尙在人間，歡慰之情誠莫可言宣了。記者奔波數日，有此收樓，也深感興奮。臨別倪君吿記者稱：彼日內赴蘇州認領，並將量力捐助吳縣浸會孤兒院，而於無名氏投書讀者尤所感念，餘容續志。</p>

<h3>浙省漁業管窺</h3>
<p>— 何孝銓</p>
<p>〔蕭山十六日訊〕値此開發實業，挽救經濟危機之聲高唱入雲霄之時，浙江之蠶絲茶葉等主要出產，已引起社會人士之注意，惟佔全國第一位之漁業，尙乏人論及。記者生長浙東，爰魷管見所及，對浙江漁業概况作一報吿。　吾浙地瀕東海，面積雖小於各省，而海岸綫之長，</p>
<p>水產</p>
<p>之富，則冠於全國，其優越條件，爲氣候溫和，寒暖流所經過，地位適中，多淡水河流，原冲積而富有機物繁殖等等，均有永產生物生殖所必須，他如沿海島嶼之星羅棋佈，文化之發達，交通之便利，更爲發展漁業上之要素，而港口曲折，海灣深邃，形勢之險要，更與建立海防所不可忽視者。國父手訂之實業計劃中之東方大港，三等港之寗波，溫州，十五個漁業港中之長塗，石浦均在浙海，爲鞏固國防發展經濟之中心，吾人當逐步求其完成。　水產事業，可分漁撈，養殖，加工製造及運輸等部門，現分述於後。</p>
<p>之要素爲漁船，漁具，漁塲，及人才資本等，他如漁期，漁法亦須注意及之，漁船爲捕魚之主要工具，吾浙漁民鑒於資本之薄弱，遂因陋就簡，仍延用色式帆布船，僅能駛用於近海，險性碩大，漁獲量亦微，戰前雖曾用新式漁業之蒸汽機拖網，但在戰時損失殆盡，際此民生凋敝，漁民衣食尙不得飽暖之時，更無力集巨資購置漁船，故甚盼政府擴大漁貸，振興漁業，漁具可分網具，鈎具，雜漁具等，乃與使用之船及地域有不同，網之彫式繁多，不勝枚舉，用網之漁獲品多爲大黄魚，小黄魚，　，帶魚，烏賊等，鈎之方式，亦各有不同，漁獲品以帶魚，銀魚，　，鱔，鯛等，漁塲在西山，舟山，黑山，玉環等島一帶，乍浦，沈家門，海門，溫州爲四大漁區，寗深，台州，溫州爲三大漁業行政區，漁期在吾浙沿海者，大黄魚四，八月·小黄魚一至三月及八至十二月，烏賊四，五月，鐲三至六月，帶魚蟹，饅（海饅）八至十二月，因氣候之變更，亦有不同，漁法爲用各種方法使魚類集中，俾可捕得多量之魚，値此科學昌明，方法日新，而頑固漁民，仍依藉舊法，今後似應捨短取長而補救。</p>
<p>養殖</p>
<p>則可與水深水淺兩種，亦有鹹淡混合水中者，此仍根據生物之習性而定，吾浙鹹水方面以夾岙蟶及奉化之蚶最著名，三門海亦飼養，其苗出於溫州之淸江渡，其次當爲松門，沿海對紫菜昆布等亦有養殖，目下均有大量出產，淡水方面，有錢塘江，曹娥江，甌江，飛雲江等，河川湖沼甚多，均可養殖靑魚，鰱，帶魚，鯉魚等。魚苗之養殖，湖州之菱湖素極發達，足供全省有餘，成魚養殖業除菱湖外，紹興，蕭山，湖州，鄞縣，亦頗著名。</p>
<p>加工</p>
<p>製造，則可與食用品與工業用品兩種食用品製造之鹽藏與乾製以定海，岱山，石浦，爵溪，海門，溫州較著，代如灌頭及魚肝油製造均付缺如。　運輸爲擴展業務之主要條件，吾浙鐵道有滬杭，浙贛二綫，蘇嘉，杭甬已在籌復中，杭溫即可興工開築，公路素稱發達，航路則可暢通沿海諾大商埠，境內河川縱橫，交通便利，惟對冷聽設備之車輛船隻，尙在添置中。　上述漁撈，養殖，加工製造，運輸以及漁鹽等等發展漁業之條件，吾浙均備且較他省爲優，而今急須者莫過於經濟與人才，行政漁管處雖擁有大量之漁業物資，曾聞撥在舟山羣島設置罐廠，魚肝油廠數處，而行總浙分區，早已結束，此一諾言未悉何日始可見效，使愛護與熟心漁業之士不勝焦念。</p>
<p>人才</p>
<p>方面，政府已極力培育中，如復員軍官之轉業及各級學校之創立，均在分頭挺進中，惟敎學漁民以新式方法技能，彼此合作，始克凑功。　吾浙漁業如能充分發展，則經濟上之問題均可迎刃而解，國計民生，亦可保無虞，賢明政府當不棄此豐富之天然資源也。</p>
<h3>貴陽零簡</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽十八日航訊〕以貴陽爲中心，四方八面的省份，無論任何重要城市的生活，都比貴陽爲高。前些日子，大江南北凡是可以逃，有能力逃的官宦紳商，只要在貴陽有一點關係可以運用的，都紛向這生活最便宜的地方跑來，不上兩個月，據市政府統計室的報吿，貴陽人口不知不覺間就增添了兩三萬人，因抗戰而繁榮，因勝利而冷落的貴陽，現在又熱鬧起來了！本來嚴重的房荒，現在愈趨嚴重，過去講法幣，金圓的房租，房老闆們馬上改爲實物，後來覺得白米漲不上黃金銀元，現在又紛紛改爲金條大頭，地方法院與警察局經常在辦理房租糾紛案件，直不勝其苦。最近，貴陽最繁榮最熱鬧的生意是銀元買賣，叮噹嚮處，萬頭攢動，省市公敎人員及其家屬幾乎無不與此發生關係，有的是企圖保存幣値，需用時脫手容易，有的則純粹由於它可以獲利倍蓗，一天在銀元市塲站上一二小時，一月所獲遠過他半年所入，不怕省會警察局如何成天成晚的在四處驅散銀元販子，但逐此銀利者仍隨處可見。工役之類的小人物無力爲此，則盡力輪番服務，利用時間去爲人挑水，煮飯，打雜，下午賣報，晚上做零售小販來作升斗米麵的餬口生涯。上司同情下屬，職員同情工役，公家的事不過背的一塊皮子，彼此「心照不宣」，誰也不向誰要求什麼「行政效率」。</p>

<h3>救濟鈔荒　銀錢業向國行建議發行定額本票　票面暫分四種國行允予考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀錢信託三業，以兩週來鈔荒迄未解除，而轉　月杪卽屈，現鈔需要又將激增，惟國行對銀錢同業隔日存款，迄仍限提現鈔百分之十至十二，短期內鈔荒根本無解決之辦法。各界現鈔週轉旣感困難，而銀錢同業以需現鈔關係，常須擱置九倍之款額於國行，影響行莊資金調度匪淺，故曾非正式與國行當局口頭逮議，除請儘可能發給現鈔外，如有不敷，則祇能請求發給中央銀行定額本票。國行當局，對發行定額本票，以彌補現鈔之不足，原亦早有此議，茲輕銀錢同業之建議，已允予考慮。聞定額本票擬定五千元，一萬元，五萬元，十萬元等四種。如當局旣不發行鉅額票面之大鈔，而中央印製廠之產泖量又無法供應需要，則定額本票之發行，短期內必將付諸實現。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕銀根昨日走勢鬆濫已極，晨開在五十元左右，各行莊普遍多單，大多在五六十元間向各方硬挜。惟各業多單紛紛求出，日拆一度跌至三四十元光景，實爲半月來所僅見。下午銀根以國行有金勢出，由鬆濫稍轉平定，日拆最後在四五十元間。　國家行局庫昨續差出廿九億餘元，大交換各行差出五億餘元，洋商各行差出一億餘元，小交換各行差入卅五億餘元。</p>
<h3>物價指數存款</h3>
<p>劉攻芸稱在考慮中</p>
<p>關於本市金融界向新財長劉攻芸建議舉辦「黃金存款」「銀元存款」「物價指數存款」等事，劉氏已在接受考慮舉辦中。昨據劉氏親告記者稱，此事尚在商擬中。目前尚無具體辦法與計劃可發表。又據記者自金融界負責方而控悉，當局對金融界之建議，其中「黃金存款」及「銀元存款」，因技術上之困難尚多，恐難舉辦。而對「物價指數存款」，則極可能實施。財政部與中央銀行刻正在考慮創辦此事，預計料施後，對吸收游資，穩定物價方面，定能收獲相當效果云。</p>
<h3>黃金市塲　組織將有變更業務範圍擴大</h3>
<p>新任財長兼國行總裁劉攻芸廿五日由京返滬，廿六日晨十時在中國銀行召集席德懋，李道南等舉行金銀平凖會議。除檢討運日工作外，對今後業務方針，亦有重要決定。據悉：金市塲組織，將有變更。業務範圍，亦將調整。行莊之信託部，均可作爲經紀人。銀元之勢售，亦包括在內。交易方式，可能採取證交辦法。聞原則已無問題，如能實現，公開市塲當益臻健全。而中央銀行對公開市塲之運用，亦當更見靈活。據劉氏語記者，財金改革方案補充辦法，正在研討中。至解救工商業危機之堅急工貸，將擴大範圍，詳細辦法，亦在擬訂中。惟究將採取訂貨或收購方式，現尚示決定。</p>
<h3>生絲鋒俏</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市勢激漲，鎮根　泛，暗息突落，散戶又起國貨。120號有肖新貨，晨開卽期二七三尤，一度高起二萬元，市勢已創高峯，勢戶頻吐，市勢稍軟。近午聞金價大漲，納胃又起，臨收仍以二七二萬午收，　一頭寸做二九三五〇〇〇元。　生絲外匯證繼續報升，人心見高，優級晨開三九五萬，嗣後一路拉至四二〇萬午收。</p>
<p>綢縀昨日買風平淡，散戶脫售尤多，市勢未見大好，華強被面晨開一九〇萬，開後卽回一萬元，走勢甚平。近年聞共同金劇升，人心好轉，但實銷仍滯，欲振乏力，終以一九〇五〇〇〇年午收</p>
<h3>內匯率調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局庫內匯率，廿八日起將調整如次：廈門每千元收二五〇元（原三百元），廣州二〇〇元（原二五〇無法了），南昌二〇〇元（原二五〇元），南京二〇元（原二〇元），鎮江常州三〇元（原二〇元），海門臨海二〇〇元（原一百元），定海岱山一五〇元（原一百元），溫州三〇〇元（原二百元），西安三〇〇元（原一五〇元），陜西區其他各地三五〇元（原三百元），蘭州一〇〇元（原五〇元）。　又郵費每筆改收三百元，電費每筆改收四千元，急電加倍。</p>
<h3>白粳突破七萬　麵粉食油漲勢劇烈</h3>
<p>昨日米市，以時值週末，貨主加二日拆息關係，扳高甚力，且週一休假，各方云化良好，更有黃金領導在先，人心頗昂，特別白粳破七關，無法錫白粳登七萬一千五百元高峯。</p>
<p>食油　漲風愈演愈烈，缺貨現象嚴重，且銀根鬆濫，執戶扳持更力，各檔貨一律猛挺二成，廠豆油破四十萬大關，生菜油高做三十六萬，吉桶生油貨缺未開，小車蔴油做四十八萬六，豆餅漲四千，長字做二萬七千元。</p>
<p>麵粉　漲勢漸趨激烈，在銀根鬆動下，實銷客銷均暢，且以週一休假，貨主以三日拆息計算，扳高甚力，老車挺升一成，兵船做二萬六千一百五十元。</p>
<p>雜糧　展開猛烈漲風，黃豆以通日油餅瘋狂上漲，人心堅俏，且頭寸鬆，市塲買氣濃厚，車豆猛晉二成，後市高喊七萬三千六，生仕供應極稀，普漲一成半，芝蔴苞米實銷甚暢，各挺二成左右，菉豆漲萬元，紅糧破三閥。</p>
<p>茶市昂俏</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕茲據茶業中人談稱：自茶存幾將告罄，同時聞悉浙省湖州一帶產茶地，對今年尚未上市之新茶，已在醖釀以白米衡值，大致每擔新茶，須白米八石以上，故執戶心思益形亢奮，對握在手中之少量陳茶，扳售之意，故態復萌，致供就能奇缺，交易再度遜落，而市氣則仍與外匯移轉證媲美，一致昂俏非凡。至於本年溫州新龍井，到源尚稱蟬聯，同業拆價，每斤仍爲八千元，比前缺乏軒輊。</p>
<p>桐油又漲　桐油趨勢，自日前甫轉平定後，昨市漲風又告復燃，而大有不可收拾之勢。揆其原因，業中頭寸益形泛濫，業外物資登造極，致人心瘋狂疾晋，喊價似同脫僵，臨收結果，上漲幅度，比前擴展，自二萬元至三萬元不等，脚地亦頗鞏固。</p>
<p>頃據業中人云：最近中信局又在收購足度桐油，俾資付裝國外，聞收價爲一角七分六厘美金。</p>
<h3>春大衣料昂缺</h3>
<p>春大衣料近日市貨流通頗寡，買方顧客欲搜選　新花色，非常因難。除火姆四本·海律斯·人字呢·真假師泡鐵克司外，絕乏合宜之呢料。卽上列之貨名，質佳色鮮者亦付缺缺。蓋舶來品久未定到，本廠貨紙向薄呢一項求出路，皆不注意毛貨春大衣料，偶有產出者亦係一二萬元一碼之下檔普通貨，以致造成拆貨帮　存之老貨好減會，價乃瞎喊云。</p>
<h3>台灣帮裝辦呢布</h3>
<p>台灣帮昨前數日來，裝辦呢絨布疋甚盛，呢絨以男女色淺色及薄質者普通貨爲限，　角與高檔質厚者無生意。布疋類以蔴膠布。白帆布，愛華呢。四　　。友生呢等爲最，昨友生呢每碼成交價八千元，四雜緾三千五百元，增　百帆布七千元，華一蔴膠存四千五百元，章　花呢六萬五千元，雙貓畢嘰五萬四千元，怡和灰華逢呢七萬元，逢隆凡立西三萬五千元</p>
<h3>圈外物價報漲華股臨收轉堅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市況昨日選　疲後堅，各股臨收均以高盤結束。晨初聞銀根走勢鬆濫如故，圈外黃金市勢挺秀，多頭心強，頗見濃厚，惟因顧忌央行拋金威脅，更因週二出關，多頭仍次雙重負息，因之買氣醖釀，陷而未發，擾面多作觀望，市勢平檔盤旋。嗣聞圈外游資潛勢雄厚，黃金勢壓後仍反動上升，於是各帮乘廉思進，塲上買風驟盛。永紗晨開七元三五，開後隔夜多頭翻空，市勢回軟，低見七元〇六分，低後圈外物價一致報漲，人心好轉，多空掙扎，行情起伏於七無法三角左右。嗣後拋金消息傳業，市勢一度徵軟，仍回落至七元一二角。近午聞拋金數量不多，金價反動猛升，人心帶俏，四邊買風齊起，行情急遽回升，最後以七元九五高價午收。</p>
<p>中小型股，晨開散戶吸納，市勢尚平，中間一度軟弱，臨收均告回升。新光由六角七開出後，低至六角五，臨收以八角漲停。景福勤興美亞開收均升許，內衣二角四，昂見二角九，其餘各股千里收均榮。</p>
<p>週一恢復後市</p>
<p>證券交易所決自下週一（廿入日）起，恢復後市交易。經悉關於後市恢復之日起，各經紀人因客戶請求，對預備交割交易，委一談到下午了結者，可向該所申請，辦理了結手續。暫以永紗，美亞，景福，新光，四種試辦。上項辦法，係以由客戶申請者方爲辦理。</p>
<p>洋股金債均升</p>
<p>外股市況走勢展堅，市上銀根趨鬆，買氣甚盛，黃金報升，人心尤俏。各股午書漲勢甚勁，怡紗做一九〇〇〇元，一九五〇〇元，一九五〇〇元，升三五〇〇元。英聯二三〇〇〇元，二五〇〇〇元，軋升二〇〇〇元，業廣七〇〇〇元，亦升一〇〇〇元。會德豐漲勢較各設有勁，做七萬二，狂升七〇〇〇元。其餘各股均俏，黃金公債晨開三十八萬進，三十九萬出，中間升至四一五〇〇〇元，臨收爲四十三萬。千後週六無法市。</p>
<h3>紗價新高疉出棉布起伏狹隘</h3>
<p>紗市反動激升，良以連疲數日，乘低進取者頗衆，兼以銀根泛濫，市拆竟降至四十元光景，於是人心浮動，買戶爭相搜購，執有者無法意吐出，致呈供不應求，市價扶搖直上，各紗頻創空前新高。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由四百三十七萬元步升至四百五十三萬元收市，較前狂跳四十一萬元。四〇支藍鳳亦隨漲四十二萬元，三二支銀月晨開二百九十萬元，施竄出三百萬大關，至三百十二萬元站定，終挺三十七萬元。</p>
<p>二支雙馬現貨始做二百二十三萬元，繼聞赤金秀挺，貨主一致喊高，價乃一路喊俏至二百四十二萬五千元結局，軋漲三十七萬元，二〇支雙馬晋升三十四萬元，他若金鷄與天女等，均在二百二十萬左右成交，一六支各檔亦破二百萬關。</p>
<p>昨日棉布趨勢不脫盤局，升降幅度甚狹，雖以赤烚報挺，銀根又濫，但人心不爲振奮，市況依然平淡乏神，皮球戶咸無法意進退，本街交易清閑，客帮問津者廖若晨星，各布最後微揚，但尚雖抵拆息。</p>
<p>龍頭細布由八萬五千五百元一路盤上八萬八千元收市，較前挺四千元，喇叭童細布未有成交，五福細布，亦高二千元。此外大雙龍與三桃細布等皆各升四千元左右。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰自八萬二千八百元開出後，曾微俏至八萬三千　百元，午收爲八萬三千元，終漲二千六百元，金蓮妙舞元嗶嘰八萬一千元，軋升二千元，昨日塲內因一般握貨者以市價太低，不顧廉售，故交易甚表凄凉，冷門各檔均無法力做開。</p>
<p>中紡拋紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨續託紡建公司在市塲拋紗，共開二次，計售四〇三件，准購六四戶，價值七九，七九四萬元。</p>

<h3>動用增資存金昨又核准八件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金管局最近續收到行莊請轉節動用移存增資現金案件八件，昨日上午十時，該局曾與國行業務局稽核處舉行第二十三次審核會議，均已核准轉節動用。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕通日票據交換中，退票數額較多，金管局前日曾派出數組稽核人員，前往各行莊查詢退票戶名及退票原因，以便對退票責任問題，有所追究。</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>— 看臺客</p>
<p>證交努力打氣獎罰推動交易</p>
<p>昨證交連發市塲公告第六五九號至第六六三號五件，其中二件是在鼓勵經紀人要把交易做得越鬧。否則要罰金，甚且要停止交易，假使生意做得多，則發給獎金。</p>
<p>過云　星期，證交生意實在清淡之至，所以股價一蹶不振。</p>
<p>昨天市面突然好起，雖則我們在週四已講過，風潮可能今後數天發出。但這二個公告的罰啊，獎啊，顯然很有效力的。</p>
<p>昨天，不僅股市好轉，一般市塲都在向高峯看齊。</p>
<p>市塲總是後良推前浪，「看齊」也者，只是一個永遠不能認以爲真的空話。</p>
<p>在過云十天左右，米煤出人頭地，其他相形見絀。所以我們認定就會向高處看齊。</p>
<p>昨天一般市價，都在急起直追了。後浪推前浪，米煤漲勢更盛。</p>
<p>米煤漲勢更盛，絕非意外。我們早經指出過，考慮了當局種種非漲不可，考慮了磊環境也漲不可。</p>
<p>金鈔銀元和米煤一樣，也是大環境中，以漲爲當然趨向，也曾一再指出過。</p>
<p>普遍性的漲風，已經開始了。但是，千看台客萬不能着迷。</p>
<p>我們在週三指出過「經常走勢」，那就是「提前一週，敲出貨物，放拆息凖備頭寸，這是期之迫近。」</p>
<p>要敲出貨物掉頭寸，必得先有一個漲風。因此，昨天開始的漲風，就得充分利用，也就得步步當心。</p>
<p>我們又曾一再指出過，注意到大環境，就得當心笨重東西和輕便東西，命運很有不同。儘管看齊是物價均，衡原則下的必然性，但只賬面看齊，而缺乏實現性的，這是沒有意義的。</p>
<p>因爲昨天開始的漲風，可能較一般人預料者大，所以必須記住這幾個基本條件，發昏是大不相宜的。</p>
<p>和談不是有日期，有地點，有人物了罷？</p>
<p>和平，人人希望，切切希望着。因而物價看好，沖淡了風緊雨急的大環境。</p>
<p>昨天漲風，與此不無法關聯。但是啊，可以他細考量的許多事實，過云如此，現在還是如此。所以，和談的具體化，可譬之爲打沙蟹，要大家攤牌了。</p>
<p>攤牌定輸贏，也就定和戰；面的回漲，在不言中了。</p>
<p>打沙蟹攤牌了漲風起心要細</p>
<p>市價一覽</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽大勢已定　華聯力克仕餘穩坐頭把交椅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨晚華聯對仕餘，結果華聯以四十六比三十四勝，上半時十八比十六。華聯今後雖尚餘二塲，但已無關宏旨。</p>
<p>昨晚球迷衆足體育館，門票共售二百廿萬一千元，計對號座三百張。樓下一千五百張，樓上五百張，盛況空前，通不購票者當在三千人以上。</p>
<p>上半時雙方難解難分，一再平手，華聯頗感頭痛，下半時吳成章的成功，劉福善的兩角中籃，李震中的「偷機」，都使仕餘洩氣，在廿八比廿三時華聯已放下一塊石頭，仕餘的調動過忙，更予對方以靜待變的便宜。</p>
<p>女組星華勝給翰三分，卅四比卅一。另塲甲一組麥令斯大勝海青，四十一比二十。海青由却爾登艦　春〇，新姿態普不見高明。</p>
<p>甲組錦標已定奪</p>
<p>先談華聯仕餘之戰，華聯以李震中，包松圓，樂嘉洲，劉福善，吳成章，五將先行出塲，仕餘出孫國政，徐仲已，吳新運，李肇和，沈鵬舉應戰。這一塲原來排在七時十五分，可是實際到四十五分鐘方開始。</p>
<p>比賽在滿塲叫好中開始接觸，國政罰球落空，新運首開紀錄。華聯成章嘉洲一擲二罰得四分，鵬舉先後二罰球，打成四分平手。老包穩定又添一球，六比四仕餘首次暫停。新運仲已相得益彰，二隻遠射中的，鵬舉又在籃底撈摸，十比六超出。華聯以傳金聲替出小樂，金聲震中松圓三人追成十分平手，仕餘亦暫行息戰。繼之福善出手，仕餘蔡金典瓦新運，連中三只罰球，又以十三比十二超出。華聯的投籃，四五次不得其門而入，老包得球運入，成章不辱使命，十四比十三華聯領前一分。新運易出肇和，不久肇和入，國政出，震中忙裏偷閒，仲已方中，松圓又來，迨新運罰球得分，上半時結束，十八比十六，華聯僅佔先二分。</p>
<p>仕餘下半時國政瓦金典，新運仲已兩隻空心遠射，氯概非凡，成章戰成廿分平手，老包犯規，鵬舉罰無法不中，成章再　平（廿二），遂成肉搏階段。廿五比廿三，槐庭調肇和出，華聯雖多一球，仍不敢輕敵。未幾金典替新運，吳傅三分，華聯廿八比廿三，好像定心了一些。震中福善「順水推舟」，成卅三比廿五。小樂調金聲，仕餘又犯着老毛病，調動太忙，姚文彝一進再出，最後三分鐘已成四四比卅，張良雄瓦震中，局勢已定，但仕餘的努力不息，觀衆依然摔塲，但華聯終以四十六比三十四勝。</p>
<p>華聯　擲罰　犯分</p>

<p>星華女將勝約翰</p>
<p>女子組開塲，星華王珊錢夢月兩人先後擲罰，約翰張羅羅林靜怡的頑抗，頃刻四分平手，王珊的長度對投籃相當自由，第一節星華十二，約翰六分。第二節羅羅奮發有爲，在十六比十四時尚差一球，使星華吃驚不小，上半時十八比十四，星華領前四分。第三節約翰靜怡漢達打出勁來，老是差半隻球，林小姐罰球捧入，頓成廿三平手。這一節星華大事調動，朱家珍瓦呈兆瑞，王文建瓦朱蘭珍任後衛，張秀麗替澤綸。第三節戰成各廿三分。末節大家顯顏色，你一球我一球，各不相讓，觀衆並不厚此薄彼，中籃必叫好不絕，錢夢月連中四球尤爲星華撐着不少家業。結果星華卅四比卅一勝。</p>

<p>合計　十五一　八卅一</p>
<p>却爾登初露色相</p>
<p>昨晚的海青是却爾登艦瓦表出戰，他們那個長黑炭也叫勃郎，有「水滸」上黑旋風的姿態，老是死釘着麥令斯歐恩蓋不放。麥令地熟，十分鐘內以十比二使海青停戰。海青的攻勢未始不凶，無法奈凖度太差，十分鐘時廿二比五，麥令全班人馬調生力軍上塲，上半時廿九比五，海青並不氣餒。</p>
<p>下半時海青形勢好轉，利潑拉由生而熟，卅二比十六後，麥令調上四個好手，結果成四十一比二十。</p>
<h3>中航鐵路龍虎鬬　新盟主今天揭曉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕兩週來春霖終日，市長盃決賽因是而兩度被延阻，改期今日下午三時仍在逸園球塲舉行，爲避免擠擁起見，提前於上午在逸園門口及中午十二時半起在市體育館發售門票，分一千二百元及八百元兩種。屆時將由市長代表市府機要室主任張彼德蒞臨給獎，市府樂隊到塲吹奏，四維童子軍維持秩序。惟連日乍雨，能否舉行比賽，可電話足球委員會三八六八三，及逸園七四五八〇，七八五七一詢問。</p>
<p>今日裁判樂，巡邊員倪孝本陸順德。</p>
<p>新盃主可獲十五枚銀質獎章，亞軍獲十五枚銅質獎章；今年因云屆盃主青白會被淘汰出局，與東華會之未有報名參加，新否主與亞軍當易新主。</p>
<p>中航與鐵路，經兩週期之休息，雙方苦練，晴雨不間斷，健兒們磨勵以須，當局鼓勵士氣，蓄銳以待時，今日碰頭，雙方當挾其全力赴，鬥智鬥能，難免一番劇戰。</p>
<p>前天春雨，塲地尚泥滑，鐵路之短傅戰術最適於在雨後之濕塲上施展，雖得地利與經騐較豐，但能否重演在聯賽時慘敗中航之威風，要看諸將之狀態而定。須知在此種重要之決賽中，諸將須要够拼足九十分鐘之氣力，球運變爲操勝之重要因素，鐵路欲穩操勝券，必須增強雨翼之速度，使之齊飛，中路三鋒始能收突破之效，後防有高保正座鎮，除非中航有避實撃虛之策略，否則不易攻破老高之雄關也。</p>
<p>中航休息兩週，在時間空間上是予中航有利，借港將有寬裕之時間，若借得羅勃斯托夫相助則對奪標之希望甚濃，茍不借將而祇召回莊文權等數舊將歸隊，亦足予鐵路以威脅。在戰略上言：應以徐祖國充翼鋒，增強兩翼之速度，欲攻破高保正之鐵陣，宜採四鋒齊頭並進，一鋒游撃戰術，當以高秀清充任游撃之職務，因小高精於控，傳，盤，射之技，有細膩之脚頭，而爲鐵路守將所注意之人物，倘彼能在中塲肆意活動兼獲得控制權，則鐵路之後防斷難得安枕也。防衛力較戌，必須拒鐵路諸鋒於離門十五碼之外，則徐福生可穩若泰山，中航之守爲最大戌點，能否克鐵路要看其後防有無拒鐵路之方法而定也。陣容如下：（戚公）</p>

<h3>女了籃球主力戰綠隊今夕逢黎隊</h3>
<p>四屆籃球聯賽今日週末循例甲女組三仗，下午五時半起在市體育館交鋒，首塲女組主力戰綠隊再逢黎隊，關係錦標前途，當有精彩演出，壓軸甲一組第二循球回力與培斐爾對壘，兩隊近況特佳，均在嶺峯狀態中，屆時相逢不免有一番惡戰。門票照舊，樓上五百，樓下一千，塲內對號一千五百元。節目先錄如下：</p>
<p>綠隊－黎隊（女子組）五時卅</p>
<p>東華－又一（甲二A　）六時一刻</p>
<p>回力－培斐爾（甲一組）七時一刻</p>
<p>女組主力戰綠隊與黎隊再度相逢，綠隊六戰六勝，保持不敗，而黎隊亦已五勝，惟首循曾遭綠隊毒手，僅此一敗耳。今晚再戰，寃家狹路，且茍得獲勝，則錦標染指有望，所可惜者該隊隊員身材均矮小，手法雖靈活，仍然吃虧不少。綠隊女將軍悍潑如虎，鋒衛俱堅挺異常，一付千斤担，黎隊恐力有雖勝耳。</p>
<p>次幕甲二A組東華與又一角逐，前者常勝，後者常敗，戰局成一面倒，可無法疑問。</p>
<p>壓軸戰甲一組第二循環回力與培斐爾交手。培斐爾在初循中七戰七敗，未嘗一勝，迨第二循環面目全非，除小挫於滬警外，連敗華聯，麥令斯，海青，恩卡斯，四復前仇，黑炭勃朗最爲危險，其次克勒格萊奇伊卡特等均饒勇異常，回力近況，大有進境，勝滬警已見非易，而日前撃敗仁餘尤爲傑出，福海志吉永芳投射正確，進攻亦快速，華　小魏戍搭配合作亦更見默契，今晚兩支勢盛氣足之隊伍，緊張之表演，殊可觀也。六隊單名錄後：</p>
<p>（綠隊）黃明媛，石宗蘭，曹曼麗，朱錦芸，王維珍，吳愛蓮，曹曼珠，伍美矣，陸偉鈞。</p>
<p>（黎隊）錢楚屏，錢函展，朱翠棣，鈕芸娟，姚思濂，徐會如，陳文瑛，蔡明霞，陳玉苓，郭買電培，徐慕本，金利利。</p>
<p>（東華）韓龍海，李垚，周達　，陳祥龍，賈幼良，張林根，張邦倫，張元吉，蔡演雄。</p>
<p>（又一）蘇石鳳，羅仲州，韓非，石揮，金燄，凌之浩，張伐，衛禹平，賀駱，王學武。</p>
<p>（回力）張浦，田福海，曹志吉，王永芳，魏戍，陳正豫，華雲山，徐叔沅。</p>

<h3>港華聯足球征貢何額貢幣十八萬</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕關於華聯征西貢之事，雖經西貢方面正式來函，表示歡迎，但香港足球總會，却以本港聯賽爲重，深恐如照西貢提議，准許華聯離港兩個週末，則對賽影響太大，因於本月之總會執委會議時，議決只許華聞離港一個週末，並聲明華聯人物必能於四月廿三日參加香港聯賽，而後能批准赴西貢之人情，華人足球聯會以此，曾函覆西貢，請更改　期，現查西貢已有覆函到，願將華聯在兩賽事，改爲四月十七與十八兩日，共　兩塲作了。並改定只担保華聯隊收入貢幣十八萬元云，現華人足球聯會，已定於本月廿九日星期二下午五時四十五分，假何倫列室召開執委會議，商討該事，如議決前往，或同時選定代表，亦未可定。</p>

<p>〔聯合社英國安特里廿五日電〕第一百零三屆歷史性的英國跳浜大賽馬明日將在此展開，預料觀衆將達三十萬人，參加比賽之名駒達四十三匹，頭獎得金杯一座與現款三六，八六八美元，跳浜賽全程四哩半，競賽過程中將有驚　險浪，興趣無窮，故馬迷趨之若狂。明日其他重要運動節目如全國足球聯賽半決賽年津與劍橋划船賽等均將爲之減色。</p>
<h3>乒乓須知（一）</h3>
<p>— 王心景著　陳霖笙校</p>
<p>王君心景爲戰前乒乓世界月刊之編者，其所編乒乓須知一書，材料豐富，文宇生動，實爲乒乓書籍中稀有之佳作。惟該書出版不久，卽在戰事中全部被燬，今王君頗爲灰心，無法意再版，特允不侫之請，擇尤在本報陸續發表，誠爲愛好乒乓運動讀者之福者，敬希注意。　陳霖笙識</p>
<p>（一）她永遠對我們輕盈的微笑</p>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>俊俏晶瑩的乒乓，她永遠對我們輕盈的微笑着。</p>
<p>現在風行的足玩球·籃球·排球·綱球·跳高·擲遠……都是有益身體的好動支。但我們該不會否認有些運動是要受年齡或性別的限制的。所以我們常會看到有些懂得人生需要運動的重要，而愛好運動的人們，一到氯衰力竭的老來，卽使捧着它所心愛的東西，不免有「髀肉復生」的感想，也絕不容你再云馳騁沙塲，享愛樂趣，是不空懷疑的·沙塲老將只落得坐在看座上回味，決不能再云親身體會了。少女們縱然對有些運動懷着愛戀，最多只好云靜悄悄站在一邊，驚聲瀝瀝的喊幾聲好。</p>
<p>我們愛玩的乒乓，她模樣兒旣生得好看，刀子對一切的人們都笑着歡迎着你玩。要是你慣喜歡流幾顆汗珠的，她儘可以使你有道地的滿意。男子們有一個乒乓球，可以恢復工作的疲勞；婦女們有一個乒乓球，可以增進家庭的興趣；老婆婆們有一乒乓球，就不致爲了你心愛的孩子們有聽說話而着惱了。</p>
<p>（二）什麽地方都可以逗着我信玩</p>
<p>乒乓運動的不愛年齡和性別的限制，在上面已經提過。同時乒乓運動也是設備比較項簡單，費用很省的一種運動祇要一張檀子，一副綱柱，自己用的乒乓拍和乒乓球就好了。要是我們經濟比較寬裕，有力量辦一張標凖乒乓權，自然是頂好，要是不能的話，也大可以用兩張吃飯的　子，或是幾塊板拼起來，舒適的玩個暢快。房子大的可以在家裏，否則沒有風的時候，隨便什麽地方都可以造起她的舞台來。設備簡單，她幾乎什麽地方都可以陪着我們玩。</p>
<p>（三）隨時都可以伴着我們的只有她</p>
<p>因爲她長的活潑和錄自強不息　因爲她愛好天然的美，而不喜歡多事粉飾；因爲她誠心的要和我們接近，所以她有一切都很簡單，便當。你喜歡她，可以把她好好的放在袋裏；你喜歡她，可以叫她出來跳舞。要是你感到煩悶，疲勞，她可以爲你盡力掃除，要是你憂警苦惱，她便能安慰你；……總之，她的一切都是可愛的。而隨時可以伴着我舞的也只有她。——白　也吧，晚上也吧。</p>
<p>可是愛她的同好舞，有時也得要留心她以外的一切，免得呌她受過，老師舞在講堂上正經的教盡，小朋友舞在這時候尤不該把她放在心上，時時拿出來看；我舞腦筋中不能同時有兩種思想，在辦事的時候，只能暫時把她好好的安置在一個寺方；……不幸而爲老師舞在講堂上發現；不幸而……不好嫁禍於茲愛成性不愿分辦的她。總之，她好，我舞也好，大家都好，　是頂要緊的。</p>
<h3>美軍組聯隊　向華聯挑戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美海軍陸戰隊第九聯隊麥令斯籃球隊及美軍運輸艦培斐爾籃球隊在聯賽中戰程完畢，即將離滬，第九聯隊之替身為第三聯隊，培斐爾之替身則為卻爾敦。美軍球隊進步猛速，對華聯盟主擬作臨別紀念賽，由美軍聯合對挑戰華聯，於下週初舉行，此賽正由籃球委員會商洽中，如能成為事實，將為本季一場最精彩籃球賽。</p>

<h3>退一步想</h3>
<p>— 五德雲</p>
<p>不滿現狀者，祇要肯退一步想，就馬上會心平氣和的。</p>
<p>譬如嫌薪水菲薄的小職員們，祇要把區區幾萬元的月俸，以法幣來折算一下；一作三百萬，那豈不是就有幾百億了麼？退一步想；在戰前，魷是中國之大，恐怕也沒有這許多鈔票呢，——難道還要不知足麼？</p>
<p>又如每日有一頓沒一頓的窮光蛋，看見人家有大魚大肉吃，就覺得憤憤了。他可是不曾想到，上古時代，咱們的老祖宗只能「茹毛飲血」，就是連燒熟的東西都不曾吃過，眞是可憐得很的。退一步講：現在煤球雖貴，倒底還不至於吃生食；戶口米雖要去擠，倒底也用不着再冒生命之危，到森林去打來吃罷。</p>
<p>又如對貪官汚吏很痛心者，其實也很傻·蓋夫四海之內，皆兄弟也，旣然咱們原是一家子，則給自己人撈去點鈔票，又算得上什麼呢？更何况退一步想：錢乃是「身外之物「，生不帶來，死不帶去，——老弟，你要貪汚也由你，我是落得慷慨的。</p>
<p>又如對於國際間二大集團最近的冷戰很覺惶恐者，怕三次世界大戰不免要爆發，我也祗好怪其人太想不開了。因爲他不能退一步想到：地球本可能會遭到突然飛來的流星的襲擊，那種毀減，是比世界大戰更可怕的。那末，——更退一步想——譬如流星已和地球撞過了，又怎樣呢？我們却居然能苟活到今天，不是已很値得「額手慶幸」了麼？</p>
<p>萬事如此想時，就很泰然了，——雖然不免要被人罵。</p>
<h3>談幽默及其他</h3>
<p>— 陳堯光</p>
<p>幽默之論來自西方，原意是一種心緒的表露，特別是詼諧的心緒。到今天，也有將幽默感解釋爲較溫和的脾氣的。有時在幾個人講笑話的塲合中，惹得其中一位動了氣後往往會有人說：「大家說着玩的，你怎麼連這點幽默感都沒有？」可見幽默之爲用亦大矣。矣。</p>
<p>幽默又可被解釋爲一種較含蓄的滑稽，也魷是說，是較不易昔遍地被了解的一種滑稽。一聽完甚至尙未聽完就哈哈大笑的是滑稽，聽完後二三秒鐘甚至經人點穿後才哈哈大笑的是幽默（思想特別敏捷的在外）。幽默這名詞未傳入中國之前，我們不是沒有幽默，說得穿一些，古曰詼諧也者，魷是幽默。今日所謂的幽默感，就是說對不順耳或不入眼的小事不要抱過份認眞的態度。說笑話時果然可以叫一個人拿出幽默感來，但若駡了人的祖宗，還要責備人說：「你怎麼一些幽默感都沒有？」那魷荒唐了。</p>
<p>號稱幽默大師的林語堂博士，留居美國多年，除了在國內曾拼命灌輸舶來品的幽默文化外，在國外也不時將小腳文化朝外送，換取的倒是大量美金版稅。雖然林博士提倡幽默有年，但在他的一位千金小姐跟洋人私奔了時，也氣得吁喘不已，林博士的幽默感那裏去了呢？由此可見倡導容易而力行艱難。談幽默出口即是，做到蓄有幽默感的地步，實非朝夕之功，即使滿腦洋文化的先生們也不能例外。貴如杜魯門總統，如有良好幽默感，也不會對批評他的專攔作家皮爾遜駡出S.O.B了。人不能盡失其眞，幽默之不易，又得到一個證明。</p>
<p>現代人好習時尙，嚮往於幽默而極盡造作模倣之能事，但到底祇是模倣而已，並非出於本性，所以大半是火功不到家的。幽默感之養成，一半靠天賦，一半靠磨鍊。而且，幽默得也須是地方，不然，吃了別人的大虧，還淡然一笑以爲是有幽默感，那就簡直成了瘟不可耐了。</p>

<h3>減價</h3>
<p>— 典辰</p>
<p>這年頭，「减價」這名詞，似乎感到陌生得很。除了被商人們作爲生意眼的號召外，可以說是寡聞鮮見久矣。</p>
<p>難得兩路局會垂靑它，這不能不使人感到興奮</p>
<p>可是我也覺得這一次的「减」，好像减得並不自然。</p>
<p>儘管說得這樣漂亮：「减低乘客負擔」，但其實呢，不過爲了减輕頭等旅客的負擔而已。</p>
<p>至於三等旅客呢？就沒有聽見下文了。</p>

<p>世界上最古的一顆樹，是在墨西哥哈嘎地方的一顆絲杉樹，周圍達一百七十五英尺，它的歲數約在萬年左右，現在還很茂盛地生長着。它的木料軍達一百二十萬八千磅，足供建造二十多座洋房所需。</p>
<p>生在地中海沿岸和非洲北部的一種奇異的葫蘆科植物，名呌「噴瓜」，當它的果實成熟時，便自動的脫離果柄，將果實射擊到很遠的地方。</p>
<h3>八股的妙用</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>八股，也有它的妙處。</p>
<p>理由：八股爲現成而固定的一套公式，有了它，可以把複雜紛繁的問題，都變爲簡單易解，只要熟誦熟用那一套公式，就不難得到答案。而由公式所產生的答案必只有一個，並無分出。</p>
<p>小時候，在國文課堂裏作文時，嘗已發現八股的妙處：不管先生出什麼題目，我總是：從「正」的方面說幾句，再由「反」的方面說幾句，然後「合」起來，便得結論，作來全不費勁，而且百試百靈。</p>
<p>生存在今日，讀書看報，爲人處世，乃至作文發言，都非易易，但如瞭解了八股的妙用，就一切不成問題了。</p>
<p>先談讀書看報：</p>
<p>今日的書報刊物，種類之多，數量之衆，說怯之各異，聲調之不同，以及採用名詞術語，解釋古今學說的各有千秋，在在令人頭昏眼花，而且經濟不勝負担，腦力不暇應付，時間無從分配。特別當「物價向拆息看齊」的今天，咱小市民和公敎人員，就說不做生意，也得設法保持自己的一點幣値，每天難免要跑到河南路去問問「大頭」行情，那裏還有充分時間精力，再來細細咀嚼「民主」「自由」的各種註釋，或一查「冷戰」「熱戰」的出處？此一是非，彼一是非，東方一聯盟，西方一聯盟，……都不是我們一只腦袋，一對眼睛，一副耳朶所可從容探討的。迫不得已，只好在錯綜紊亂的世相中，找出一套八股，一個公式，立志讀一類書，看一種報，聽一種聲音，無庸三心二意。能如是，許多難題就無不迎刃而解。</p>
<p>如照魯迅先生所說，讀書也有「忌」的話，兩種相反的書同時一讀，便因相質相「忌」而要正負消長，等於不讀。那麼，「八股法」魷尤有奇功了。如此說來，爲人處世，寫文發言，應借重「八股」之處，自更不在話下。</p>
<p>抗戰時，「老粗」們總喜用這樣的邏輯與人爭駡：「他媽的，抗戰時期，軍事第一，老子就代表國家，你侮辱老子，便是侮辱國家！」對方往往因此而默然。可見八股之追，早已普遍流行，不過今日尤所急需耳。</p>
<p>但所應聲明者：八股有時間性，有地械性，其用法因時因地而異。從前的不適於今日，他處的不適於此處。用的時候，還要力求適應才好！</p>
<h3>夢中得小剗殘花句醒忽有所觸因足成一律以抒吾懷</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>春來常自怨東風，不定陰晴變幻中，小草依然隨意綠，殘花尙作有情紅；山河間隔何曾遠，會合難期總是空；日日相思人老矣，拚將微命付鴻蒙！　　寄包天笑丈台灣</p>
<p>（和烟橋韻）</p>
<p>莽蕩中原日已沈，風　雨虐苦相侵，羨公蓬島留高躅，老我荒江思素心；排悶無如栽竹好，戀家未許入山深；何時重訂看花約，置酒花前共細斟。</p>
<h3>一張本票</h3>
<p>— 裴晶</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>晚報載，三月份上半期生活指數一三三九·三六倍。</p>
<p>生活指數發表了。金鈔在狂跳，油米在飛漲，華股漲風未息外匯掛牌直升。公用事業明天又要調整了。指數追不上物價，底薪又小，半月的收入，還不够還債。杜米漲出四萬大關，銀元賣到四千八百元，我在辦公室裏急得頭痛。</p>
<p>「老張，裏面拿薪水。」</p>
<p>「喔，」我走進會計室，拿到了自己本月份的薪水袋，覺得奇怪極了。怎麼那麼薄？那麼輕？我懷疑地拆開來，是一張三萬五千元的本票！</p>
<p>這半月的辛勞，就是一張花紙嗎？</p>
<p>這幾天現款特別缺，但是，我需要用現鈔呀！第一，欠房東太太四斗米折算的房錢；第二，公司衷借飯司務三個大頭，約在發薪後還給。第一次魷失信，下次萬一有急用時，就難跟他再開口了。</p>
<p>在會計室裏，我對着那張本票發呆。</p>
<p>「現鈔眞少，銀行都缺現鈔。」會計先生嚴重地吿訴我。本來我想和他商量一下的，他搶先一說，倒使我不好意思開口了。於是，我只好默默地走出了會計室。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>誰還有現鈔？</p>
<p>我想起了小王：「老兄，現鈔有嗎？這張本票能不能想想辦怯？」</p>
<p>「現鈔？我自己買的香烟錢，還是茶房整的。」</p>
<p>小王提起了茶房，我倒想起他送貨常常有外快，也許會有現鈔的，我決定找他去設怯。事出預料，他剛送貨出外，回來時間沒有一定。</p>
<p>顧秘書平時銀行往來戶不少，外面也很兜得轉，不妨去找他一試·糟糕！他正在聽電話。「……公司裏發薪水都是本票，啊！那裏還有現鈔，喂！沒有……」顧秘書在對電話裏說。</p>
<p>我推進門他沒有注意，正聽得這個電話，何必自討沒趣呢？我便輕輕地回出來了。</p>
<p>茶房已經回來了。我連忙趕過去。</p>
<p>「喂！本票換現鈔，有辦法嗎？」</p>
<p>他一楞，對票面一望說：「數目不够，我祗有五千多元。</p>
<p>「那末去買三個大頭有空嗎？」</p>
<p>他點點頭，接過本票，向外走去，</p>
<p>天黑了，公司裏的人都已回家，我還在等待。</p>
<p>茶房回來了說：「買銀元，要現鈔，本票不要。」</p>
<p>我自已走到烟號裏：「買一條銀行牌香烟。」老闆看我摸出一張本票，笑着說；「找的錢需九折計算，否則，都買香烟。」</p>
<p>「天哪！這張本票啊……」</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>第二天消晨，我還睡在床上，房東太太故意笑着說：「今朝米價又漲上七千塊了·」說了又笑。</p>
<p>但是，我不能怪他對我這種嘲笑似的說話。總是我欠人家的房錢不好。</p>
<p>我趕快走到表弟店裏，誚他貼換現鈔來救急。他答應我下午去取，我的心總算安定一半了。沿途我打聽銀圓的價目，大頭已賣到五千元了！希望不要再漲了</p>
<p>下午，我向公司請了假去拿錢，總算交情關係，沒有貼水，三萬五千元現鈔照數拿到，我帶着錢回來。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>趕忙去買大頭，走到河南路轉角，新價目又開盤了。</p>
<p>「大頭六五賣出。」</p>
<p>「便宜點行嗎？」我問·</p>
<p>「買幾個？」</p>
<p>「買三個大頭，幾錢？」</p>
<p>「一萬九千元，便宜嗎？」</p>
<p>我付了他一萬九千元，補進了三個大頭。在陽光淡照下，三個大頭在我手上閃着光。</p>
<p>晚報消息又來了：「杜米漲出五萬關。」</p>
<p>我摸出剩下的一萬六千元，算一算四斗米的價目：這數目使我在晚風中打了一個寒噤·</p>

<h3>Beginning of Peace Talks Set for April 1st in Beiping; Government Representatives to Depart Soon; CCP Representatives Finalized and Officially Announced</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] Smooth progress has been made in the peace negotiations between the government and the Chinese Communist Party. The He Cabinet issued a statement on the 24th, appointing representatives and hoping that the CCP would immediately specify a time, location, and representatives. This was answered by the CCP's broadcast around 5 PM on the 26th, clearly stating that the negotiations would be based on Mao Zedong's eight conditions, with the Nanjing Nationalist Government as the negotiating party, and would be held in Beiping starting April 1st. The government's preparations have been actively underway in recent days. Huang Shaohong, one of the five representatives, is scheduled to fly from Hong Kong to Nanjing on the 28th. The delegation will also establish a secretariat, likely to be headed by Li Junlong. The government spokesman made no comment on the CCP's announcement of the time and location on the evening of the 26th. However, it is widely believed that the departure date of the government delegation will not be later than the 30th. Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Shizhao, and Li Zheng gathered again at the Ministry of National Defense at 10 AM on the 26th, presided over by He Yingqin, to discuss the military reorganization issues within the peace negotiation guidelines. The meeting ended in the afternoon. All four declined to reveal the contents, but it is said that the discussion was extremely thorough, fearing a repeat of the breakdown of negotiations in the 35th year of the Republic. Zhang Shizhao, a peace negotiation representative, told reporters on the evening of the 26th that he has always been optimistic because both sides need peace. Zhang also used philosophical words, saying: "The most serious matter is also the least serious matter." Zhang also believes that the battles nearing the Jiangbei bridgehead will not affect the progress of the peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Report] A CCP Beiping Xinhua News Agency telegram broadcast at 6:10 PM on the 26th stated: "This station is instructed to announce that regarding the peace negotiation matters, the CCP Central Committee decided on the 26th that April 1st would be the starting time for the negotiations. The location will be in Beiping. The CCP representatives selected are Zhou Enlai, Lin Boqu, Lin Biao, Ye Jianying, and Li Weihan. Zhou Enlai will be the chief representative. The negotiations with the Nanjing delegation will be based on Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation of January 14th and the eight conditions he proposed. The above decision has been immediately notified to the Nanjing side through radio broadcasts, instructing them to dispatch a delegation according to the above time and location, carrying the necessary materials required for the eight conditions to facilitate progress."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] A cabinet spokesman said on the evening of the 26th that Premier He will convene a meeting at 9 AM on the 27th to discuss plans for sending government peace representatives to Beiping before April 1st to begin peace talks. He said that Premier He is currently studying the CCP broadcast and will not elaborate on this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 26th] After the CCP announced that it would begin peace talks with the Nanjing representatives in Beiping on April 1st, people here felt joyous. Official sources believe that this expression from the Communist side shows that the end of the Chinese civil war is in sight.</p>
<p>The above picture shows the five CCP peace negotiation representatives announced:</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai</p>
<p>Lin Boqu</p>
<p>Lin Biao Ye Jianying</p>
<p>Li Weihan</p>
<h3>A Bolt From the Blue During the Control Yuan Meeting: Yu Youren Resigns as President; Supervisory Committee Members Appoint Representatives to Return the Original Letter and Earnestly Urge Him to Stay</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, submitted a detailed letter to all Supervisory Committee members at the Yuan's general meeting on the afternoon of the 26th, requesting to resign from his position. The letter was read by Liu Zhe, the chairman of the meeting. All the members were shocked upon hearing the news, as if struck by a bolt from the blue. They immediately spoke up, unanimously expressing their desire to retain him, and promptly appointed members Liu Zhe, Yu Dechun, Tang Honglie, Gu Fengxiang, Lü Chao, Leng Baodong, Chen Hanzhen, Song Ying, Yang Qunxian, Cui Zhenhua, Qiu Niantai, Li Mengbiao, Cao Haosen, Liu Pingjiang, Li Zhengle, and Feng Yunxian, a total of sixteen people, to go to President Yu's private residence to earnestly persuade him to withdraw his resignation and return President Yu's letter of resignation. Liu Zhe stated first that everyone had been in high spirits since the start of the Control Yuan meeting, but unexpectedly, the President suddenly submitted his resignation, which was no different from dropping a bomb. Tang Honglie, Gu Fengxiang, Song Ying, Li Zhengle, and others also spoke one after another, saying that the Control Yuan was relying on the President's leadership, and that in today's difficult situation, the President should not suddenly have thoughts of resigning. Yu stated that his resignation had been decided long before the Control Yuan meeting began, and the reason he had not submitted it earlier was because he feared it would affect the emotions of his colleagues during the meeting. Now that the meeting has largely proceeded smoothly to its conclusion, he is submitting it specifically, asking his colleagues to select another capable person. As for his own resignation, it is not a passive expression, but because he feels that after resigning as President, he can contribute more to the country. The committee members talked earnestly at Yu's residence for 20 minutes, but Yu still did not withdraw his resignation. Finally, the Supervisory Committee members stated again that if the President did not withdraw his resignation, all the Supervisory Committee members would come to the President's residence to urge him to stay and would be willing to advance and retreat with the President. After saying this, they returned Yu's letter of resignation. Yu repeatedly said, "Cannot, cannot," and placed it on the table. Tang Honglie then returned the letter of resignation to Yu's hand, saying, "The President has withdrawn his resignation." When Yu was about to say something, Tang and others stood up and said goodbye amidst a chorus of "Withdraw your resignation," and told reporters waiting for news in front of Yu's reception room: "Reporters, the President has already withdrawn his resignation." The Supervisory Committee representatives then returned to the Yuan to report to the general meeting that they had returned the President's letter of resignation and that the President had withdrawn his resignation. All the Supervisory Committee members applauded enthusiastically upon hearing the news. However, according to Secretary-General Li Chongbao, Yu's intention to resign is very firm, and he is still continuing to request resignation. Yu's original letter of resignation is as follows:</p>
<p>Yu's Original Letter of Resignation:</p>
<p>"Respectfully, I, Yu Youren, have been entrusted with the position of President due to the trust of my colleagues. In the past eight months, the changes in national affairs have been great, the suffering of the people has deepened, and the work of this Yuan has become more arduous. Although I have exerted my utmost foolishness, I have not been able to provide any assistance. I know that I am old and often ill, and my strength and heart are far apart, so I cannot force myself to overwork. In the future, the promotion of peace and the reform of politics require a spirit of great benevolence and great courage to lead, which is not something that a confused and foolish person like me can do. I hereby submit this letter requesting to resign from the position of President, and I hope that my colleagues will prioritize the country and the development of the work, and will not blame me, Yu Youren, for avoiding difficulties. It would be fortunate and grateful if my request is granted. This is addressed to the entire committee of the Control Yuan's 38th Annual General Meeting, Yu Youren, March 26th."</p>
<p>Staying in Nanjing After Resignation</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] Yu Youren told our reporter on the evening of the 26th that his request to resign as President of the Control Yuan was because he saw that after resigning as President of the Control Yuan, he could contribute more to the country, and it was by no means a passive expression. As early as last year's election for President of the Control Yuan, Yu had already been unwilling to hold the position. The reporter asked if all the Supervisory Committee members are now retaining the President and expressing their willingness to advance and retreat with the President, and if they do not</p>

<h3>Draft Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement; Contents Divided into Two Parts; Both Parties Request Government Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch of the 26th] Regarding the negotiations on the Sino-Soviet trade agreement, the draft is currently being submitted to both governments for approval. The content of this plan has attracted much attention. Our reporter recently learned the gist from a semi-official but absolutely reliable source. According to the person, the draft is divided into two parts: one is the Sino-Soviet Xinjiang Trade Treaty, and the other is the Sino-Soviet Xinjiang Economic Cooperation Agreement. The former focuses on technical issues related to trade, while the latter is a method for Sino-Soviet cooperation in the development of industrial and mining resources in Xinjiang, including oil, uranium, coal, iron, gold, silver, etc. in Xinjiang Province. When asked about the basic spirit of this plan, the answer was: Under General Zhang Zhizhong's consistent advocacy of good neighborliness and pro-Soviet sentiment, this agreement is absolutely equal and mutually beneficial, and insiders believe that it will be beneficial to the livelihood of the people of Xinjiang and Sino-Soviet friendship. When asked if this negotiation, if successful, could improve the special situation in Xinjiang (referring to the Yining side abandoning its confrontational attitude), the person replied: Of course!</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Member Proposes a Corrective Motion Regarding the High-Priced Sale of Silver Dollars to England; Requesting the Government to Formulate Other Effective and Powerful Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] Tang Honglie and Hu Wenhui, two committee members sent by the Control Yuan to investigate the Central Bank's high-priced sale of silver dollars in Nanjing and Shanghai, have submitted a corrective motion. The motion, after explaining the investigation process, stated: "The government's military and political expenditures are enormous, and income and expenditure cannot be balanced. Currency inflation and rising prices are inevitable results. If the sale policy is used to raise military expenses, the government's gold, silver, and material resources are limited, so how can it be sufficient to sustain this? If the sale policy is used to stabilize prices and combat speculation, its effect is also minimal. The reasons for this are approximately fivefold: (1) The people have lost confidence in the gold yuan notes. (2) General speculators are observant, technically skilled, and ruthless, and are also familiar with the official situation. All government measures cannot escape their clutches. (3) Various banks and money houses are united, all targeting the government. (4) Many military and political organs are established in Shanghai, and after a large amount of money is received, boxes of unused banknotes are transferred to the market and become speculative capital. Various banks and money houses often use the method of breaking up wholes into parts and consolidating parts into wholes to manipulate the gold and silver market. It is doubtful whether these firms and brokers have powerful figures as their backers. Based on the above individual reasons, the bank's sale policy is, rather than打击投机, increasing speculative capital. The result is the opposite. As for the silver dollars sold on the 18th and 19th of March, the price was uniformly 7,000 yuan, which was lower than the market price in Shanghai on that day, but higher than Nanjing and other places. This stimulated price increases in various places, and it is inevitable that it will cause serious consequences. Moreover, the government's gold, silver, material resources, and foreign exchange are limited. Repeated sales will cause the treasury to become empty. The failure of Song Ziwen's gold sales policy can serve as a warning. In short, this dangerous method of the Central Bank, quenching thirst with poison and fighting fire with firewood, will not only fail to remedy financial difficulties and stabilize price fluctuations, but will also accelerate financial bankruptcy, increase speculative forces, and make prices in various places rise due to widespread speculation. Looking to the future, the crisis is great. A corrective motion is hereby proposed, requesting the Yuan to forward it to the Executive Yuan to quickly formulate other effective and powerful policy measures as a fundamental plan."</p>
<h3>It is Confirmed that There Are Only Fifty to Sixty Troops in Banqiao Town, Beitou</h3>
<p>Most of Them Have Returned South</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] On the 25th, a portion of the 97th Division stationed in Banqiao Town near Jiangning Town, under the guise of crossing the river to attack, suddenly turned north in Qiaolin Town in Jiangbei and defected to the Communist army. This news was confirmed by officials on the 26th, but the situation is not serious. The division commander, Wang Yanqing, is a graduate of the sixth class of the military academy and the fifteenth class of the Army University. He is a veteran cadre of the 18th Army, and his troops have always been known as elite, with excellent quality and unwavering loyalty. When Wang led his troops north, the various units discovered Wang's intention and returned south. Therefore, Wang only led his chief of staff, two deputy regimental commanders, and fifty to sixty soldiers and fled towards Wujiang. Banqiao Town is peaceful and the defense is very solid.</p>

<h3>Communist Offensive in Suburbs Halted; Navy and Army Cooperate to Keep Anqing Safe; Communist Army Attacks Macheng in Eastern Hubei But is Repelled</h3>
<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch of the 26th] Anqing City is safe. A small group of Communist troops that broke into the suburbs have been driven out by the defending troops. Naval artillery fire is supporting the military operations, and a division of Yang Gancai's troops has arrived to reinforce, and the situation has stabilized. This time, the Communist army attacked Anqing because the troops of the North China Central Headquarters and the troops of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters changed defenses and took advantage of the void, forcing their way into the suburbs of Anqing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 26th] According to a telegram from the Navy Headquarters in Anqing at 8 PM on the 26th, Anqing City is still in the hands of the National Army, and the city is peaceful. The National Army is currently holding its original positions outside the suburbs against the Communist army. Xiwang Temple, which was captured by the Communist army, has been recovered by the National Army. Several naval patrol boats are stationed on the Anqing River surface, using fierce artillery fire to attack. The Communist army's offensive has been blocked and has made no progress.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 26th] The Eighth Pacification District has been transferred from Anqing to Jiujiang.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch of the 26th] According to Jiujiang News: Anqing is being firmly defended by the National Army.

Yang Lianggong, president of National Anhui University, also led more than 300 faculty members and students to move south. The students all carried their luggage on their shoulders and walked south. Although supplies are extremely difficult, their spirit is very good.</p>
<p>[Our Huangpi Dispatch of the 26th] Yesterday, a certain unit of the National Army increased its defense of Xishui. No large groups of Communist troops have been found in the territories of Guangji and Huangmei counties.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 26th] The situation in Central China, which changes rapidly, has not yet emerged from the delicate stage. However, judging from the current movements on various fronts, this situation of uncertain tension seems to be gradually becoming clearer. Macheng, which has long been controlled by the Communist army in eastern Hubei, was forced to launch another round of offensive and defensive battles on the evening of the 25th. The Communist army's offensive has clearly encountered setbacks. On the west side of the Pinghan Railway in central Hubei, the Communist Jianghan Column and a part of the Tenth Column attacked Changjiangpu in the southwest of Yingcheng and Dangmeng County in the northwest of Yingcheng from places such as Liujiagang in Yingcheng. The defending troops repelled all attacks.</p>
<p>[Our Changzhou Dispatch of the 26th] On the northern Jiangsu front today, except for a small skirmish caused by the National Army in the Shijiaqiao and Sanwenhe area of Zhenjiang strengthening the bridgehead fortifications and making a slight advance to the north, the remaining areas, including Longwokou south of the port, remain in a quiet state. The Southeast Column of the Communist Army north of Yizheng City has now moved south to the vicinity of Shierlicha.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 26th] The authorities have decided to open Guazhou for one day on the 27th, free of charge, to evacuate refugees from the north and south.</p>

<h3>From the Money Shortage to Silver Coin Savings</h3>
<p>— He Shiqi</p>
<p>Although the Gold Yuan has reached a point where no one cares for it, the issue of money shortage still shakes the entire society. This is because the Gold Yuan is still the current medium of exchange, which is why everyone feels the pain so acutely. In fact, the current money shortage is an inevitable product of excessive credit expansion. The authorities have neither a fundamental solution nor a way to stop the malignant inflation of the national currency, but they are doing everything they can to tighten issuance. Sleeping in this state of contradiction and anxiety, it is difficult for the amount of currency to meet actual needs, and the money shortage problem cannot be fundamentally resolved.</p>
<p>Credit expansion should be resolved by saving national treasury expenditures and tightening credit. Even if issuing is tightened temporarily, it is by no means a permanently good policy. Moreover, the bank owes the people debts, but does not have sufficient cash reserves. It is simply issuing "empty" bank drafts that cannot be cashed, which is not only unfair to the people who have to endure the unmentionable loss of discounts, but also inappropriate in terms of legal principles. What is especially ridiculous is that some banks even cleverly added horizontal lines to the bank drafts when they issued them, in order to use this as a reason to refuse cash payment. However, this is fundamentally illegal; because a bank draft is not comparable to a check. Its very nature is a Cahier's Order, stipulated as a voucher for cash payment. After searching through China's negotiable instruments law, no clause can be found that allows horizontal lines to be added to a bank draft.</p>
<p>Since the crux of the money shortage problem lies in the expansion of credit, it cannot be solved by simply issuing more currency. The Central Bank's recent method of issuing silver dollars is nothing more than avoiding the issuance of new currency and using silver dollars collected in the past to replace cash chips to relieve the temporary money shortage. However, this neglects some technical issues: First, the silver dollars issued by the Central Bank include Eagle dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Dragon dollars, Yuan head dollars, Sun head dollars, and miscellaneous dollars minted by various provinces. The fineness is not uniform, and the prices vary greatly. Judging from the situation in the market at that time, apart from the Yuan head dollar, which was priced above 7,000 yuan, the prices of other dollars were relatively small, even with a difference of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per coin. May I ask whether the people can bear this unexpected loss? Second, if the Central Bank really wants to maintain a listed price of 7,000 yuan per coin and allow silver dollars to circulate smoothly regardless of the edition, it must issue silver dollars on the one hand and find ways to collect them on the other. If it only issues and does not collect, may I ask who can afford such a loss? Furthermore, issuing silver dollars worth about 7,000 Gold Yuan each, the increase in chips must be imaginary. If the authorities cannot work hard to save expenses and tighten credit, then they must have a fundamental tool to shrink the overall currency and stabilize people's hearts in order to prevent the recurrence of money shortages.</p>
<p>Regarding the identity of silver dollars, since the authorities stipulated that silver dollars were allowed to circulate and be traded previously, and then issued silver dollars afterward, we have every reason to believe that it is a currency that runs parallel to the Gold Yuan. Although the authorities have not yet officially announced it, and the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau has even partially denied the currency status of silver dollars, if we look at the whole country, the general trend is that silver dollars have clearly become the main currency. In Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, Changsha, Hankou, Jiujiang, and various rural areas, which transaction is not conducted in silver dollars? Aren't the deposit and loan businesses of banks in Lanzhou, Kunming, Changsha, and other places using silver dollars as the unit? Aren't the Central Mint and the Gansu Currency Bureau rushing to manufacture silver dollars? Let us put aside the proposals of legislators such as Qiu Hanping, who represent public opinion, to issue silver dollars and silver dollar notes, and also put aside the governments of Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces recognizing silver dollars as currency (Shen Bao Chengdu 23rd telegram), and even put aside the silver dollar issuance proposal of the Chongqing Senate. Let us just say that the newly appointed Minister of Finance and President of the Central Bank, Liu Gongyun, is also planning to issue redeemable silver dollar notes to circulate at the same time as Gold Yuan? (Financial Daily, Nanjing Special Telegram, 23rd) Based on these many facts, we dare to say with certainty that silver dollars will definitely have the status of currency in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, there are now some scholars who, based on theory, oppose the circulation of silver dollars. They believe that the silver standard is an outdated monetary system in terms of monetary principles, and the price of silver is easily affected by fluctuations in the international market. However, they have ignored the potential circulation preference (Lipuidity Prefererence) of silver dollars. It is well known that the people in China today generally prefer silver dollars. Although the government has repeatedly tried to ban them from using them, it has never been effective, and has instead become more prevalent. This shows that their preference is by no means something that anyone can deliberately create. The facts are such that everything can only be accommodated to the facts, and guided by the situation. When it comes to preventing the involvement of international market fluctuations, it can be done by strictly restricting the import and export of silver. As for the issue of silver dollars and Gold Yuan circulating at the same time, there is no shortage of precedents to draw on. For example, the Goods Dollar advocated by Irving Fisher, the gold and silver bimetallic standard (Bemetalic Standard) prevalent in Europe and America before the nineteenth century, the old Mark and Landen Mark in Germany during the First World War, the ruble and Chervonetz after the Soviet Revolution, and the concurrent use of "taels" and "yuan" in the early Republic of China, all had non-negligible economic functions, and are very similar to the current situation in our country. In short, we do not oppose any theory, but theory should adapt to the environment to be effective. Otherwise, forcibly applying theories that do not suit the national conditions is not only like cutting your feet to fit your shoes, but also like "oranges turning into trifoliate oranges when transplanted north of the Huai River."</p>
<p>Then, silver dollar savings meet the urgent demands of all sectors at present. If the Central Bank wants to avoid being blamed and recover the silver dollars that have already been issued, why not follow this path to achieve the effects of regulating currency, shrinking currency, tightening credit, and stabilizing prices? Everyone knows that today, when the people have suffered from the disaster of currency inflation, who does not hope to obtain a tool that can maintain unchanged purchasing power to protect their own property? As long as the policies of our financial authorities are not fickle and repeatedly changed, and the silver dollar savings themselves do not fall into the same tragic fate as government bonds, gold savings, and US dollar savings, then the people's surplus purchasing power and the currency not needed by the social economy will inevitably return to the government's hands through savings. Furthermore, after the currency is withdrawn, the new currency will no longer need to be issued continuously, and the original currency in society can also be recovered successively. Is it not better for the government to use this huge amount of savings to make up for the deficit than to borrow foreign currency from abroad with collateral?</p>
<p>When handling silver dollar savings, a large amount of currency can be recovered. Then, will the situation of cash chips be more serious than it is now? Regarding this issue, I don't think it is necessarily the case. Because silver dollar savings are a relatively stable unit. It is not like the current Gold Yuan, whose value fluctuates. People deposit money in the bank, which not only earns interest but also does not need to bear risks. Who would be willing to leave cash at home? In this way, people will naturally not carry cash to do transactions, and bank deposits will not flow out without staying. The turnover rate of deposits will certainly not be as fast as it is now, and credit will naturally be tightened invisibly. Savings will naturally have a restraining effect on circulation chips. Furthermore, if a panic occurs in the market for cash, it will be sufficient to cope with it by releasing a portion of the absorbed cash or silver dollars to regulate it.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that although the silver dollars currently issued by the Central Bank are disguised banknotes, because they have intrinsic value, their value will never depreciate along with the Gold Yuan. At best, they will be withdrawn and hidden as expressed by Gresham's Law. Therefore, I think there is no need to worry too much, but the government must quickly promote silver dollar savings at the present time when Gold Yuan and silver dollars are issued simultaneously, so that floating capital can obtain a proper destination. Otherwise, if the war does not stop for a day and production does not increase, no matter how many Gold Yuan or silver dollars are issued, it will be difficult to fill the social desire, and the money shortage problem will still be difficult to completely solve.

<h3>U.S. Aid to China Deadline Extended: House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes Bill to February 15 of Next Year</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a bill on the 25th to extend aid to China to February 15, 1950. This bill will allow the use of $58 million already allocated to China but not yet used in the new fiscal year. Without the extension, aid to China would end on April 2. This bill has been submitted to the House Rules Committee and will later be debated by the House. A similar bill is currently in the Senate, extending the Economic Cooperation Act to December 31, 1949, but Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Connally told reporters that he would accept an amendment to the bill to extend the aid to China period longer. Although it is difficult to say what the final form of this bill will be, observers believe that the bill will proceed smoothly and China will definitely receive assistance. Chinese people here are very pleased with this development.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] Cleveland, the head of the Economic Cooperation Administration's aid to China program, said on the 25th that the House Foreign Affairs Committee's passage of the extension of the aid to China program to February 15, 1950, "is very good news, because without this bill, the aid to China program would end at midnight on April 2, cutting off the remaining funds in the rural reconstruction program and the material supply program."</p>
<p>Cleveland said: Roughly speaking, the US$58 million will be able to extend the material supply program by two or three months, while also extending the rural reconstruction program for more time. He said: "The fund for maintaining the staff of the ECA's China Division is also necessary during the period when they are needed to assist in the distribution of materials. Goods approved for purchase in June may not be shipped until August or September."</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 25th] The Economic Cooperation Administration today allocated 42,716,000 yuan to aid China, West Germany, and seven European countries. About 16 million yuan for China will be used to purchase cotton in the United States.</p>
<h3>The United States Should Assist Qingdao to Become a Model Area: Suggestion from the Head of the Civil Air Transport Team</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] Personnel from General Chennault's Civil Air Transport (CAT) on the 25th urged the United States to assist in making Qingdao a model area, to prevent the spread of communist propaganda. Republican Congressman Ansir presented the opinion of CAT flight team leader White Reggie and requested that it be given serious consideration.

<h3>Chongqing Assembly Holds Economic Symposium: Advocating Regional Economic Independence, Liu Hangchen and Others Visit Zhang Qun for Detailed Discussions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] The Chongqing Municipal Assembly held a Southwest Regional Economic Symposium at 10:00 AM on the 26th. The original proposing member, Tu Chongguang, chaired the meeting, stating that to stabilize the Southwest, it should become an independent economic unit. The administrative offices within the jurisdiction of the Pacification Headquarters should utilize gold and silver, as well as un-transported grains, and retain a portion of national taxes as a reserve for redeeming silver-backed currency, issuing silver-backed notes that are valid in the five provinces and cities of the Southwest, and withdrawing gold yuan. Prominent economic experts from the Chongqing financial community participated enthusiastically, expressing their views. Liu Hangchen agreed with the concept of regional economy, but emphasized that the new financial measures should be independent from fiscal revenues and expenditures. He criticized the current problem as stemming from the indistinguishable nature of the currency used by the people and the government's military and political expenses. The Dean of the School of Business at Chongqing University, Zhen Bao Xian, believed that to cope with the widespread devaluation of gold yuan and in preparation for the possible blockade of the Yangtze River, a regional economy was indeed necessary. However, it should be officially named "Regional Monetary Economy" to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. The five provinces and cities should use silver dollars as the unit of account for transactions and issue joint-venture notes and mint coins (including subsidiary coins) for use. Gold yuan could still circulate, with daily exchange rates posted by the Central Bank. Goods from outside the region would be traded in silver dollars or through barter. Furthermore, the salaries of central government agencies in the five provinces and cities should be paid in silver dollars to avoid confusion. Pan Yangshan advocated the issuance of commodity-backed circulation notes and hoped for a swift self-organization, as requesting the government to handle it was unlikely to succeed. Lan Zehui hoped that the Chongqing Central Bank would quickly release its silver dollar reserves to alleviate the currency shortage. The meeting adjourned. Liu Hangchen, Kang Xin Zhi, Kang Xin Ru, and others visited Qun to discuss the matter further.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] Liu Hangchen stated on the 26th: (1) Zhang Qun invited him to return to Chongqing to organize a Southwest Financial Research Institution. (2) The Central Trust Bureau entrusted him to transfer nine tons of scrap copper from the Pacification Headquarters to Chongqing, but the purpose was not specified. (3) He had consulted with Liu Gongyun in Beijing and Shanghai, and Liu stated that 60 billion gold yuan had already been issued. Currently, one-third of the printing machines at the Central Printing Plant have been shipped to Taiwan, affecting banknote production.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] Zhang Qun announced on the 26th: Some banks and businesses are engaging in the excessive issuance of cashier's checks, leading to a flourishing of premium fees (貼水), stimulating prices, and affecting the financial situation.

Furthermore, the premium fee here on the 27th was 45%.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 26th] Prices in Rong (Chengdu) are soaring wildly daily. Gold, silver, cloth, yarn, rice, and hundreds of other commodities change prices multiple times a day.

<h3>Gansu and Qinghai Restrict the Carrying of Gold and Silver Out of the Provinces</h3>

<h3>Japan Levies Heavy Taxes on Overseas Chinese, Our Delegation Lodges Protest, Submits Memorandum to Allied Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Overseas Chinese here are deeply concerned about the heavy taxes levied by the Japanese government. Our delegation in Japan has submitted a memorandum to Allied Headquarters today, protesting the Japanese government's heavy taxation of the 7,000 overseas Chinese in Yokohama for last year. The memorandum states: Local overseas Chinese are willing to pay taxes to the Japanese government in accordance with the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, but they must not be subjected to discrimination. They specifically urge Allied Headquarters to investigate this matter. Furthermore, the taxes to be paid by overseas Chinese in Yokohama last year were fifty times higher than the previous year. One overseas Chinese merchant opened a shop in the middle of last year and was ordered to pay 2,125,240 Japanese yen in income tax after operating for less than a month.

Our delegation also suggested that the local military government pay attention to this matter and requested that Allied Headquarters instruct the Japanese government to abolish the deadline of April 7 for paying last year's taxes.</p>

<h3>Worsening Relations Between the Soviet Union and Iran: Closing of Three Consulates in Iran</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Authoritative sources report: The Soviet government is in the process of closing its consulates in Tabriz, Mashhad, and Rasht within Iran. Due to strict censorship, this news has not yet been transmitted from Iran. According to diplomatic dispatches, the Soviet Union has been moving belongings from these three Soviet consulates, but the telegram did not specify whether this action constitutes the formal closure of the consulates.</p>
<p>Diplomatic circles believe that if the Soviet Union formally closes its consulates in Iran, it will soon demand that the Iranian government close its only consulate in the Soviet Union – the consulate in Maku. It is believed here that the Soviet Union's next move is connected to two aspects of the Soviet government's recent policies: (1) The Soviet Union is constantly putting pressure on Iran, accusing it of colluding with the United States and Britain. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson recently condemned the Soviet Union's behavior, and spokespersons for the U.S. and Britain simultaneously declared their deep interest in Iran's security. (2) The Soviet Union has recently decided to significantly reduce the number of foreign diplomatic personnel stationed in the Soviet Union, suspecting them of engaging in espionage activities. While people here are not willing to speculate on the Soviet government's actions, it is generally believed that diplomatic relations with Iran will probably not be severed in the short term, nor will its embassy in Tehran be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Terrible Shanghai - Kai Mufeng</p>
<h3>New Leads in the Headless Dismemberment Case: Police Station Receives Two Tips, Secretly Processing, Significant Progress Expected Soon</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the headless dismemberment case on Jinji Road was discovered on the 21st, this reporter has been diligently collecting various clues, witnesses, and physical evidence related to the case until last night, and has been continuously publishing them. On the one hand, we provide faithful reports for our readers, and on the other hand, we also hope that all materials can help the authorities in their investigation. However, yesterday, this newspaper received a call from Chen Tiansan, a spokesperson for the police bureau, stating that the investigation work is now underway, and in order to maintain confidentiality and complete the arrest of the murderer and solve the case as soon as possible, he hopes that this newspaper will temporarily suspend continuous coverage of the case. The Changshu Police Sub-bureau, which is handling the case, has also instructed all officers in charge to proceed secretly and strictly prohibit disclosing any information to the outside world.</p>
<p>However, according to confirmed information obtained by this reporter, the police announced a reward for informing on Friday night, and yesterday afternoon, someone submitted two confidential reports to the Changshu Road Police Sub-bureau. These two letters will be of great help to the investigation of this case and were personally reviewed and decided by Sub-bureau Chief Cheng. It is believed that significant progress will inevitably be made as a result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, summarizing the various clues up to last night, the police bureau has been unable to sort them out, so the investigation work, although actively carried out by a large number of police personnel, is still in its initial stages. According to someone engaged in actual investigation work and with deep experience in criminology, the most important investigation route is to determine the identity of the victim. To date, the identity of the deceased is still unknown, and the bureau has not been able to confirm or deny whether the two cases are indeed related.</p>
<h3>An Experienced Discussion with a Surgical Authority</h3>
<p>According to this reporter's conversation last night with a doctor in the city who is regarded as a surgical authority in China, under normal circumstances, without proper tools (such as a saw, sharp knife, etc.), the result of dismembering a corpse cannot be as neat and clean as the meat pieces in this case. According to the doctor, if the bones of the corpse have no knife marks, it can be determined that it must have been sawn apart. The surgical expert also said that under normal operating room conditions, it would take about three hours or more to dissect the corpse into thirty-two pieces if there were assistants and nurses available. If one person worked alone, it could take five or six hours to do it unhurriedly. Since the internal organs of the corpse have been removed and the meat pieces have been washed clean, it is possible that several people colluded, not just one person. In addition, questions such as the origin and size of the woman's jacket, whether there is mud on the package, and whether there are any other clues have not yet been reliably answered as of last night. According to police research, the oil bag that was used to wrap the body shows that the time before discarding was not too long. Therefore, it may prove that the address where the crime was committed must be not far from the Shandong Guild Hall, but current investigations have not been able to discover any missing men in the nearby area. The most intriguing thing about the dismemberment case is that the internal organs and head have never been found. If the murderer could hide or destroy the internal organs and head, then why bother to discard the other parts of the body in a non-secret place? According to an experienced investigator, the evasive words of Li Changan, the long-term worker at the Shandong Guild Hall (who discovered the discarded body on the morning of the 20th), are also a major mystery in the case. If Li's evasiveness is due to fear, then this psychology must have its reasons.</p>
<h3>The Realization of "Murder Will Always Be Revealed" Depends on the Assistance of Citizens and Newspapers</h3>
<p>The aforementioned criminology expert also recalled that more than ten years ago, an international "suitcase corpse" case that shocked the city occurred in Shanghai. At that time, the victim was a young and beautiful Chinese woman whose body was stuffed into a suitcase and shipped to Nagasaki by the Nippon Yusen shipping line. At that time, Shanghai was still in the concession era. The organizers of the case mobilized all the detective personnel to track down the rickshaw or car that was transporting the suitcase at the time. After several weeks of investigation, the rickshaw was finally discovered through the assistance of a newspaper reporter and the mutual assistance association of rickshaw pullers. The case was solved based on this key discovery. From the rickshaw puller's mouth, they found the location of the crime and thus found the people who lived there and were missing. The investigators then arrested the main culprit in the case, the Portuguese Remédios. Remédios directly admitted that the suitcase corpse case was his doing and also admitted that it was a crime of passion due to jealousy. At that time, from the discovery of the corpse to the solving of the case, it took more than forty days. In the agonizing process of the investigation with no progress, the investigators always kept the Western proverb "Murder will always be revealed" in mind, calmly responded, and finally solved the case. According to the criminology expert, the dismemberment case investigation is still in its early stages. The investigation work will inevitably encounter many difficulties in the future. However, with the assistance of citizens and newspapers, the proverb "Murder will always be revealed" can be expected to be realized again.</p>
<h3>Mayor Borrows Cash to Pay Salaries and Allowances to Public Servants and Teachers: Determined to Pay in Full Before the End of the Month, Totaling Approximately 3 Billion</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Finance Bureau is actively planning the salaries and allowances for public servants and teachers in the city for this month and is determined to complete the payment before the end of the month. The multiple will be 675 times, which is three times the 225 times in the middle of last month, meaning a total of 900 times will be paid this month. Due to the current shortage of spot sales, Mayor Wu contacted Liu Gongyun, President of the Central Bank, by telephone yesterday afternoon, asking him to raise funds as much as possible. The estimated total is quite large, approximately 3 billion. Qian Jianfu, Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, stated that no matter how difficult the economic situation in the city is, efforts will be made to raise the employees' salaries and allowances in full and pay them before the end of the month.</p>
<p>According to statistics obtained by this reporter, after the announcement of the "Measures for Adjusting the Treatment of Central Government Employees," public servants and teachers in the city can adjust according to the monthly index multiple announced by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. This index is based on the local cost of living index. If we calculate based on this month's cost of living index of 1339 times, then the Mayor's base salary is 800 yuan, which is 158 yuan after the discount. Each month, he can receive more than 210,000 yuan. Bureau directors receive an average of more than 184,000 yuan, department heads receive more than 158,000 yuan, and staff members receive only more than 80,000 yuan. In addition to fixed salaries, those above the appointment level receive office expenses. It is understood that the Mayor's office expenses are about equal to the salaries and allowances of one and a half department heads, the Bureau Director's office expenses are equal to the salaries and allowances of one department head, and the department head's office expenses are equal to the salaries and allowances of one staff member. Ordinary staff members have nothing but salaries and allowances. What can be used to make up for this is the in-kind allocation, which is worth about 30,000 gold yuan. In addition, there are two dou of welfare rice, worth 10,000 yuan. The water and electricity subsidy is about 12,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Mayor Personally Meets with Representatives of Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools: Responds to Three Requests, Really Unable to Further Increase Salaries</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Representatives of the Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Association and the Municipal Primary School Principals' Association met with Mayor Wu yesterday morning at 11:00 AM to propose three points: (1) Please ask the Mayor to dispel the intention of resigning and continue to serve in this difficult situation. (2) Please issue another 1,000 times salary before the 28th to alleviate the urgent need. (3) Please increase the operating expenses of each school to cover expenses. The Mayor personally met with them and responded to each point as follows: (1) He expressed gratitude for the kind intentions of retaining him, but stated that he was unable to continue serving due to his failing health. (2) Based on the actual municipal economic situation, he can only issue another 300 times the salary. Now, due to the repeated requests of the representatives of municipal primary and secondary school teachers, he has tried his best to raise funds and decided to issue another 675 times the salary on the 30th and 31st of this month. It is really impossible to handle the request to increase it again. In addition, the welfare rice for April will be issued in advance, which will also provide a lot of assistance to teachers and staff. (3) It is true that the operating expenses of each school are not enough to cover expenses, and he is currently studying ways to increase them.</p>
<p>[Additional News] The Municipal Primary School Teachers' Association is scheduled to hold a representative conference at 1:30 PM on the 29th at the Municipal He'an Primary School on Xinza Road to discuss the matter of going to Nanjing to petition for improved treatment and to urge the payment of outstanding allocations of oil, coal, and other in-kind items.</p>

<h3>Agreed Upon Overdraft Funding for National Schools: Disbursement at 900 Times the Standard Within the Week as Advance Payment of Next Month's Salary</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The public and education sector's cost of living index has not yet been released. With skyrocketing prices and no solution to the salary problem, public and education personnel are facing severe threats to their livelihoods. Faculty and staff salaries at national universities in this city were disbursed at 75 times the standard for February. At the beginning of March, the Ministry of Education disbursed at 500 times the standard, which the professors' association considered to be a supplementary payment for February, after which no further funds were disbursed. To date, school funding and the living conditions of faculty, staff, and students have reached a point of exhaustion and are unsustainable. Yesterday morning, the presidents of various national universities in this city, including Zhang Yi, Wang Zhizhuo, Xia Jianbai, and Zhu Guozhang, jointly went to the Central Bank to negotiate the issue of overdraft funding. Because the Ministry of Education is far away in Guangzhou, it is difficult to determine the overdraft standards. After discussing with Lin Chongyong, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, it was temporarily agreed to overdraft at 900 times the standard of 819, to be disbursed within this week. After receiving these funds, the schools will disburse faculty and staff salaries at 900 times the standard as part of an advance payment for April salaries.</p>
<p>According to the presidents, the current student public expenses, the basic salaries of manual laborers, and the basic salaries for professors' academic research have all increased. Therefore, when the Central Bank overdrafts at 900 times the standard of 819, the amount disbursed by the schools according to the current basic salaries only amounts to slightly over 700 times the standard. The school presidents still need to find other ways to make up for the shortfall. Currently, the professors' association believes that March salaries have not been disbursed at all, while the school presidents believe that 75 times the standard was disbursed for February and 500 times the standard was disbursed for March, but both are awaiting supplementary payments according to the index. This issue urgently awaits a comprehensive solution from the central government.</p>

The entertainment tax collection in this city is able to truthfully verify and collect taxes based on the total business revenue.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueqin Files Another Private Prosecution Accusing Li Ming and Others of Fraud and Assault: Testifies in Court About Being Deceived, Emotionally Agitated and Near Collapse</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of Zhang Xueqin, the sister of Zhang Naiqi, one of the Seven Gentlemen, regarding the marriage dispute with Dr. Li Ming, after Zhang's accusation and prosecution of Li for the crime of assault, was concluded by the District Prosecutor's Office, which decided not to prosecute. However, Zhang filed a private prosecution with the District Court, accusing Li Ming and the Civil Defense Captain Chen Xiangxiong, Chen Zhu Shi, Shu Hongfang, Zhao (female), Yang Yueying, and others of fraud and assault. The complaint briefly states: In October of last year, due to suffering from high blood pressure, she sought treatment from Li Ming. Li immediately took the opportunity to be solicitous and generously gifted her with medicine. On the 14th of the following month, Zhang's birthday, Li again presented gifts to celebrate and proposed marriage after conducting an investigation. On the anniversary of her mother's death, Li again visited her home to pay respects. That evening, he proposed marriage to her and asked to cohabitate in advance, which she refused. Li then requested to hold an engagement ceremony during the upcoming Lunar New Year. He then drafted a "revolutionary marriage contract," but because Li insisted on including a clause in the contract stating that the man could "take a concubine," which she could not accept. Later, Li took the draft back. She then fell ill and was unable to get up. After further investigation, she learned that Li was already married. In order to protect her own future happiness, she went to Li's home on March 1st to retrieve the marriage contract. Unexpectedly, this angered him, and he incited Chen Xiangxiong and others to assault her. Li also said that she would have to prepare a large sum of money before he would agree to return the marriage contract.</p>
<p>The case was initially tried in court yesterday by Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court. The defendants Li Ming, Yang Yueying, and Chen Xiangxiong appeared in court to respond. Zhang, who suffers from heart disease, became very emotional while testifying in court about being deceived and nearly collapsed several times. After questioning the defendants, the court decided to conduct further investigation and reschedule the trial.</p>

<h3>Defendants in the San Shen Zhuang Hoarding Case Acquitted</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Lai Jinting was the operator of the Fuchang Shen Zhuang Relief House, which was engaged in the sugar business. The manager of the Zhuang, Zheng Wenjian, resided in Fujian for a long time, and Lai was responsible for the Zhuang's operations in Shanghai. Between July and August of last year, he successively purchased and stored 100 bolts of rubber tweed and 24 bolts of fancy bi ji. Cai Zhengfa was a runner for the Hongli Shen Zhuang Relief House. The manager of the Zhuang, Lin Zhaoping, resided in Fujian, and the deputy manager, Liu Shougong, was responsible for all operations in Shanghai. On September 4th, 16th, and 17th of last year, Cai separately purchased and stored twelve pieces of white native cloth, each piece containing fifty small bolts, and one hundred bed covers of Duofu brand. Lai Chunzao was the operator of the Jinhe Shen Zhuang Relief House. The manager, Yang Jie, went to Fujian on August 15th of last year. Lai purchased twelve pieces of eight white native cloth, each piece containing fifty small bolts, and two pieces of printed native cloth bed covers, one with one hundred and fifty small bolts and one with one hundred and sixty small bolts, between August 30th and September 16th. Because the above Zhuang purchased and stored large quantities of important daily necessities as non-businessmen, hoarding for profit, they were seized by the Yimiao Police Precinct and sent to the court for trial. The District Court has held several hearings and summoned the defendants. The defendants argued that the items stored were all purchased on behalf of customers in Fujian. Due to the uncertain shipping schedule between Fujian and Shanghai, they had no choice but to purchase and store the items in advance, waiting for the ships to transport them to Fujian. Moreover, the items purchased were all native cloth, with special export permits from the customs, which could be used as evidence. Yesterday, Judge Ruan Qin of the District Court concluded the trial in court and pronounced the defendants not guilty.</p>

<h3>Economical Smokeless Stove to Be Launched in the Short Term: Experimenter Xu Uses About Sixteen Pounds of Coal for Cooking and Boiling Rice All Day; Still Some Shortcomings Being Studied and Improved</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] "Economical Smokeless Stove," what an alluring name! In today's China, when electricity cannot be fully utilized, most families rely on coal stoves for cooking, baking, and boiling water. Therefore, every household has a large or small coal stove. However, coal stoves have two shortcomings: (1) the coal gas is too heavy, and (2) too much coal is consumed. These two problems are being solved by the Central Industrial Experiment Institute. Yesterday, a reporter visited the institute and conducted a detailed investigation of the design principles, construction, and usage methods of the economical smokeless stove. Here is a report:</p>
<p>The purpose of the stove is to directly burn inexpensive bituminous coal, allowing for complete combustion without smoke and fully utilizing the coal's thermal energy and waste heat to improve the stove's combustion efficiency. Other fuels such as firewood and anthracite coal can also be used in this type of stove with good results.</p>
<p>How can this goal be achieved? When bituminous coal burns in the stove, it must have four key elements:</p>
<p>Economic Smokeless Stove Design Diagram</p>
<p>(1) Sufficient air supply, (2) close mixing and contact between air and combustible gases, (3) maintaining the firebox at the ignition temperature of coal gas, (4) sufficient residence and combustion time. The design principles of the stove are relatively complex and will be omitted. Let's first talk about the structure and usage of the stove:</p>
<p>(1) When starting a fire, first place a small amount of firewood and paper on the rocking grate (see K in the appendix) and light it. After about three minutes, add a small amount of coal on top. After 15 minutes, the coal fire will be vigorous, and then place another part of the coal on the inclined grate (J).</p>
<p>(2) The coal on the grate (K) is mixed and combusted with the primary air entering through the ash door (I) and the secondary air entering through the (L) door, which helps combustion. This secondary air is preheated by the high temperature of the firebox when passing through the jacket wall (M), increasing combustion efficiency.</p>
<p>(3) The coal on the grate (J) is completely and slowly distilled by the air entering from the coal adding door (H), a part of the main air entering from the ash door, and the high temperature radiated by the firebox, so that all the volatile substances in the coal are slowly distilled out and mixed with the preheated air flowing downward from the jacket wall (M), resulting in complete combustion without smoke.</p>
<p>(4) The high-temperature combustion gas first comes into contact with the pot (A), the boiling water tank (B), and the soup pot (C) to reach a sufficient temperature for stir-frying dishes, boiling water, and simmering soup. It also lightly passes through the hot water tank (F), using its residual heat to heat the water. At the same time, the left side and the upper part of the baking oven (E) are heated by the transfer of high-temperature radiant heat, so that the internal temperature is sufficient for baking bread and keeping vegetables warm in winter. The flat top (D) on the upper right of the stove can be used to place the necessary utensils in the kitchen when cooking.</p>
<p>(5) When removing ash, simply use a long hook outside the ash door (I) to rock the grate (K) back and forth, allowing the coal ash to automatically fall into the ash chamber. At the same time, the coal that has become coke on the inclined grate falls onto (K) and continues to burn. Fresh coal can be added to the upper part of the inclined grate to continue its distillation effect. The small holes in the inclined grate are conical with a small top and a large bottom, so that even crushed coal will not clog.</p>
<p>(6) When keeping the fire burning slowly, simply add a thin layer of wet crushed coal to the upper part of the coal fire, close the partition (not shown in the diagram) at the bottom of the chimney, and close the air vents of the coal adding door and the ash door, and close the air vents of the secondary air door (L), so that it can be kept burning overnight.</p>
<p>(7) The method is the same when burning firewood.</p>
<p>After the design was completed by the institute, it underwent several experiments, and the results were very satisfactory. In the first experiment, bituminous coal was continuously burned for eight hours without smoke. The amount of coal burned was three pounds per hour. In the second experiment, bituminous coal was still used for actual household stir-frying and cooking, with intermittent experiments. The fire was stopped when not in use, and coal was added for testing when needed. In this way, only sixteen pounds of coal were used all day. In the third experiment, firewood was used, and about twenty-two pounds of firewood were used all day.</p>
<p>The designers of this economical smokeless stove are Gu Yuqun and Chen Xuejun. The institute's experimental work has been greatly affected due to insufficient funding. According to the person in charge of the institute, this coal stove still has some shortcomings and is being studied and improved, such as its size being too large (about the size of a small desk), making it inconvenient to carry and transport. Efforts are being made to reduce its size as much as possible without affecting combustion efficiency. After both the form and internal structure are deemed satisfactory, the stove design will be drawn up in the shortest possible time and mass-produced for launch.</p>

<h3>The Reign of the G袍 Brothers: A Land Dispute in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Lai Gong</p>
<p>[Chongqing, 21st Dispatch] During this time of unrest, Chongqing seems to be under the reign of the G袍 brothers. They openly kill people and then start legal battles with the courts. This case originated from a land dispute involving the Chongqing World Buddhist Fellowship Association. Caught between the G袍 brothers and the Fellowship, Xie Dezhi sacrificed his life on behalf of the Fellowship. The Xie family has resided in Chongqing for a century, and his late father was widely praised for his peaceful charity. He passed away just two years ago at nearly ninety years old. Xie himself was in his fifties this year and had more than ten children, all studying at the university, middle and primary school levels. He was currently the only expert in Chongqing capable of authenticating jewelry. Throughout his life, he was enthusiastic about public welfare and devoted to Buddhism. Since joining the Fellowship, he spared no time or money to assist with its affairs. The chairman of the Fellowship was Pan Changyou, the vice-chairman was Du Minying, and other directors included Ju Zheng, among others. Xie also served as one of them, holding the position of director-general.</p>
<p>The predecessor of the Fellowship's land was the Dongyue Temple, which was leveled by enemy aircraft during the Anti-Japanese War. Neighboring residents then expanded their properties. The Yichuan Theater nearby occupied a large portion. Time flies, and it has already been ten years. After the government returned to the capital, the Fellowship decided to build the Lotus Master Hall, bringing up the old matter and demanding the return of the land. This matter was entrusted to Xie, who was both a director and the director-general. Xie verbally urged the residents to move out without success and was then assigned to be responsible for filing lawsuits. Finally, they won the case completely. Unfortunately, almost all of the residents were local G袍 brothers, and several were leading figures. As a result, even after four attempts to enforce the court's decision, there were no results. For Xie, he couldn't please either the G袍 brothers or the Fellowship. On the G袍 brothers' side, this incident planted the seeds of his death. They believed that everything was Xie's sole initiative and that the entire process disregarded their face, affecting their usual lawless social standing. They tried every possible way to retaliate against him personally. The wealthy and powerful Yichuan Theater took on the responsibility of leading this retaliation. The chairman of Yichuan, Jiang Xiangchen, was a city councilor. The general manager, Dai Kunyuan, was a retired regimental commander. The deputy manager, Mou Dezhang, was a major shareholder. The owner of the Li family opera troupe, Li Shizhi, which was currently performing martial arts operas and Beijing operas at the theater, was a pillar of the underworld. Among these four, the main perpetrator, Dai Kunyuan, was skilled in martial arts. He originally served under Yang Sen and later defected to Fan Shaozeng. After Fan retired, he also lost his job. During his time in the military, he was known as "Hairy Bull" due to his crude and unreasonable nature. He now had a large number of former soldiers from Fan's army under his command, as well as the double qualification of being a G袍 brother. He was the most influential bully in Chongqing. As a result, the title of manager of Yichuan fell on him. This lineup was already a significant threat to Xie. Unexpectedly, Dai and Mou stepped forward and either went to Xie's house to threaten and insult him or directly broke into the Fellowship during lectures to create disturbances. They also sent messages through others, declaring that they would kill Xie. Xie was very frank, but at the urging of friends and relatives, he went to other provinces several times to avoid them for some time. Not long after Xie returned home this time, Yichuan suddenly sent someone to plead with Xie, willing to voluntarily relinquish the occupied land and lease other land. However, after the lease procedures were completed, the theater not only did not vacate the original site but also supervised workers to build dormitories for the Li family troupe on the land that had just been reclaimed by the Fellowship and had the foundation stones laid. This was obviously making things difficult for Xie, but Xie only dared to be angry and did not dare to speak out.</p>
<p>On February 14th (the 17th day of the first lunar month), Xie went to the Fellowship at 4 PM as usual to listen to Buddhist scriptures. Soon after he sat down, residents Xu Jinxiu and Wang Yinchang barged into the lecture hall, urging Xie to come outside, saying they had something to discuss. They pushed and dragged him to Xu's house. Suddenly, shouts and beatings erupted. The front door was blocked off. The main perpetrator, Dai Kunyuan, first grabbed Xie's collar with his left hand and slapped Xie's ears twice with his right hand. Then, he continuously struck Xie's left temple and ear roots. Xie just clasped his hands and said, "Grandpa Dai, please spare me." Another main perpetrator, Mou Dezhang, jumped out and tightly grabbed Xie's hands, kicking Xie's lower body violently. The other accomplices punched and kicked, competing to strike. The commotion and groans alarmed the two workers outside the room. Realizing something was wrong, they ran to the lecture hall and screamed for help. By the time the people listening to the scriptures dragged Xie to the lecture hall, he was half-dead. Unexpectedly, the perpetrator Dai Kunyuan led the crowd to follow and shouted to kill him. The fellow devotees bowed and clasped their hands, begging bitterly, before they stopped. At this time, Xie was unable to speak. The fellow devotees saw the situation and feared for his life, so they accompanied him to the court to report the case and have his injuries examined. After returning home, both Chinese and Western doctors diagnosed bleeding from blood vessels in his head, and everyone was helpless. The hospital also refused to admit him because his injuries were beyond cure. During this period, Dai, Mou, Jiang, and others formally sent people to Xie's house to inquire if he was dead. His family was disturbed and uneasy. The patient already felt complete numbness on the left side of his body. So, they asked for favors again and barely managed to send him to Kuanren Hospital. At 7 AM on February 21st, he died as a result of his injuries. His family temporarily moved the body to the Fellowship for viewing. The people of the Fellowship were moved to tears. They immediately hosted the press and drafted a complaint on behalf of the deceased's family, listing the perpetrators Dai, Mou, Jiang, and seven others as defendants. The deceased's family, dressed in mourning clothes, presented the complaint to the court, pleading with the judge to examine the body and detain the perpetrators. For a moment, the courtroom was filled with the cries of the deceased's family and the noise of the crowd. The judge ascended the bench and said to the deceased's family, "Since the plaintiff is dead, and the prosecutor's office has sent personnel to examine the body, the prosecutor will investigate and handle the case according to the law." Then, he immediately adjourned the court. The next day, the newspapers of Chongqing rushed to disclose the news, shaking the entire mountain city. After the deceased's family left the court, they expected someone to come to examine the body, but no one came. After inquiring at the court, they were told that someone would come tomorrow. The next day (22nd), they waited all day, but there was still no result. It was not until the third day (23rd) that the examiner came, but after a brief look, he did not fill out an injury form and slipped away timidly. The deceased's family was furious and hired someone to take four large photographs of the injuries. The left side of the deceased's face was completely black and swollen, unrecognizable. The left chest was severely injured and completely blue. The limbs all over the body were unevenly blue and purple. The scrotum drooped like a bowl, looking very miserable. On the 22nd, the perpetrator Dai and others, saw the news unfavorable to them published in the newspapers and panicked. They immediately set up more than twenty tables that day and invited all sectors of Chongqing, using the G袍 brothers' tone to smooth things over. Then, several leading figures came forward to purchase clothing, coffins, and burial items for the deceased, claiming that they were paying out of their own pockets as a third party. At the same time, they often went to Xie's house and tried to persuade them in both soft and hard ways, willing to raise living expenses on behalf of the deceased's family, as long as they withdrew the lawsuit and accepted reconciliation. The perpetrator continued to be the general manager, and the theater continued to open and perform as usual. The only difference was that the theater's gate often gathered many poorly dressed so-called demobilized soldiers, supposedly borrowing money to raise living expenses. Until the court moved the case to the criminal court for handling. At the next hearing, there was still no one in the defendant's dock. As a result, the court announced that the defendants had not been summoned and adjourned the court for another hearing at a later date. In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed. The deceased's family saw that the perpetrators were still flaunting themselves in the city. The deceased was not buried, and the living had no support. They dragged their children and went to the Women's Association to cry and complain. It just so happened that "March 8th" was approaching. In the afternoon, women and people from the Fellowship, who came uninvited, formed a marching team, led by the deceased's family holding the spirit tablet. They went directly to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Garrison Command, and the local court to submit petitions. They shouted slogans and posted leaflets along the way. On that day, almost everyone in the city used this matter as a topic of conversation. But strangely, all the leaflets were torn down as soon as they were posted, and torn down cleanly. Even stranger, this news that shook the whole city and directly knocked on the government's door was only vaguely mentioned in two newspapers the next day. With great difficulty, the court reopened the case at 3 PM on March 16th, but only interrogated the defendants. The court loudly summoned the names of the perpetrators Dai Kunyuan, Mou Dezhang, and others, but there was no response and no one was seen. Only the chairman of Yichuan, Jiang Xiangchen, the city councilor, and one or two others among the defendants came to the court to answer questions, while more than a hundred G袍 brothers who had come with them immediately filled the courtroom to the point where it was impenetrable. This tense scene ended within half an hour with an adjournment. Jiang was then led out by the G袍 brothers and calmly stepped into a private car, speeding away. It is said that the outcome of this case will depend on the court hearing on March 28th. Our reporter.</p>
<h3>Looking at Rural Western Sichuan: Discussing the Land Restriction Policy</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Chengdu Dispatch, 18th] With the turbulent situation and shifting public sentiment, political reform has become the unanimous demand of the people, especially land reform, which is the most pressing need at present. Last month, Zhang Cui returned to Chengdu and announced his governing principles, especially emphasizing the implementation of "land reform" as the focus of rebuilding the Southwest. Based on this, the Sichuan Provincial Government passed the "Sichuan Land Restriction Policy" last week, which may not be a brave and combative "revolutionary" action in today's Sichuan social environment.</p>
<p>Western Sichuan's Prosperity from Farmers' Blood and Sweat</p>
<p>With the warm spring blossoms, this reporter specially took a trip to the counties on the outskirts of Chengdu to investigate the real situation in the countryside. The Western Sichuan Plain is lovely. These days, spring has deepened, plants are thriving, the wheat fields are green, the vegetable patches are yellow, and the smoke-filled forests and villages are reflected in the distance. Farmers, both men and women, work hard in the fields. From now on, hardworking farmers have already begun to cultivate, and their blood and sweat are creating the warehouse of the Heavenly Kingdom—the prosperity of the Chengdu Plain. These farmers are mostly tenants hired by landlords. They work hard all year round and find it difficult to get enough to eat. At the same time, due to years of civil war, heavy taxes and levies, even small and medium-sized landlords find it difficult to maintain their lives and are forced to sell their land, resulting in land concentration and the emergence of some new large landlords. According to accurate surveys: In the past ten years, the number of new landlords in the Western Sichuan Plain accounted for 71% of the total number of landlords and occupied 89% of the land. In Dayi, which has undergone the greatest changes, the number of new landlords accounted for 88% of the total number of landlords, occupying as much as 99% of the land.</p>
<p>Land Concentration and Farmers' Hardships</p>
<p>From the recent visits of reporters to a small number of counties, it was discovered some special phenomena in Western Sichuan land, such as the proportion of new landlords in Dayi; military landlords account for 2.9% of the households but occupy 66% of the land, averaging 4,000 mu per household, with the highest exceeding 40,000 mu; bureaucrat landlords account for 47% of the households and occupy 33% of the land, averaging 200 mu per household, with the highest exceeding 9,000 mu. Old landlords only have 12% left, occupying less than 1% of the land. For example, in Chongqing, the land of a certain new large landlord has an area that covers most of the county, 20 li long and 40 li wide. Statistics on Western Sichuan Plain land show that 60% has been transferred and concentrated in the hands of warlord landlords, and 30% is dispersed among bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry. The reason is that Western Sichuan's water conservancy is well-developed, and there are fewer droughts and famines. It is generally believed that land is the most reliable investment object. The illegal profits accumulated by warlords and bureaucrats over the years are concentrated on buying land. These large landlords have many fields and abundant financial resources. At the same time, they use various evil forces in politics and society to squeeze and bully all tenants to the extreme. The blood and tears of Western Sichuan farmers are a tragic and inhumane history.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Implements Land Restriction Measures</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the trend and address this fact, the Sichuan Provincial Government has formulated the "Sichuan Provincial Land Restriction Measures," with the main points: (1) A land restriction levy will be implemented on the area of land owned by private individuals or organizations throughout Sichuan. (2) The number of people in a household will be based on a family of five, and will be limited to permanent cohabitating family members. (3) The classification of fields will be based on an annual grain yield of 4 shi or more per mu for top-grade fields, 3 shi or more for medium-grade fields, and less than 3 shi for low-grade fields. And the upper, middle and lower level of land will also be classified based on an annual wheat yield of 1 shi and 5 dou or more per mu, 1 shi or more, and less than 1 shi. (4) The quota for farmland is that each household shall not exceed 50 mu of top-grade farmland, 70 mu of medium-grade farmland, or 200 mu of low-grade farmland. The quota for land is that each household shall not exceed 75 mu of top-grade land, 100 mu of medium-grade land, or 150 mu of low-grade land. (5) If the number of people in a household exceeds five, the quota will be increased by one-tenth for each additional person. (6) The excess land collected should be immediately re-divided and reorganized, and then granted to the people who will cultivate it, in the following order: (1) current cultivators, (2) original tenant farmers, (3) retired soldiers and families of active soldiers who have the ability to cultivate, (4) other farmers who have the ability to cultivate and need land. (7) The price of the excess land collected will be compensated in installments with a combination of land bonds and cash.</p>
<p>Western Sichuan Farmers are Generally Awakened</p>
<p>The implementation of the "Sichuan Land Restriction Measures" is a wise and timely move by the authorities today. Without going deep into the rural areas of Sichuan, one does not know the greatness of the Sichuan farmers. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the three years of the civil war, Sichuan farmers shouldered arduous burdens for the country in terms of soldiers and grain taxes. Looking at the rural areas of Western Sichuan, reporters can understand the characteristic of the Chinese nation to strive for glorious survival through enduring hardship and resentment. They have never complained about fulfilling their national obligations by paying heavy taxes and levies, and serving in the army. However, the unreasonable concentration of land has led to the emergence of new warlord and bureaucratic landlords who use the evil forces of the old society, such as baojia, local tyrants, and G袍 brothers, to exploit the farmers. Sichuan farmers have silently endured this extremely harsh environment for decades. But the result of this contact proves that they have awakened. From the "25% Rent Reduction" to the "Land Restriction Policy," Western Sichuan farmers are generally actively striving for it. The measures promulgated by the Sichuan Provincial Government are just a move to follow the trend. If even this is lip service and not put into practice, the consequences will be difficult to predict.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>[Our Report] After the tense situation in northern Jiangsu, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were blocked, and the supply of grain from the north bank was completely cut off. In the past, most of the rice and grain in this county relied on large shipments from northern Jiangsu. The main grain-producing areas in northern Jiangsu that regularly supplied rice and grain to this county included Gaoyou, Douye, Yangzhou, and Taizhou, but now it only relies on the four rural villages. Apart from this, it relies on neighboring counties such as Jiangning, Lishui, Jurong, Jintan, and Danyang to maintain the supply, which is simply pitifully small. Sometimes, when the price of grain in Shanghai is high, rice merchants transport the rice to Shanghai for sale at high prices.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Orphanage Takes in a Stray Child for Five Years, Returns to Warm Home</h3>
<p>…Another Harvest of Our Newspaper's Social Services…</p>
<p>About half a month ago, this column received a letter from an unsigned reader, saying that there was an orphan Yan Genfa, 11 years old, who was tricked from Shanghai to Suzhou by a child trafficker five years ago. Later, he was questioned by the police, and the trafficker escaped. He was taken in by the Wu County Baptist Orphanage, but remembered that his father owned a flower shop in Shanghai and his mother had passed away long ago. He asked this column to try to visit his parents so that he could return to a warm home. After receiving the letter, this column immediately started the investigation work. We pursued the "fruit of service" with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>First, we learned from Dean Sheng of the private Wu County Baptist Orphanage at 56 Xieyaqian Street, Suzhou, that Yan Genfa was admitted to the hospital in the summer of 1944. He spoke with a Chongming accent. Initially, he was a beggar at the Chufang Bridge in front of Guanyao in Suzhou. He was very pitiful. Later, the owner of the nearby Huang Shuntai Hotel transferred him to Mao Shuyun, the owner of the Mao Shangzhen Printing House, who sent him to the hospital for care. It has been five years since then, and he is now studying in the second grade of elementary school. His father's name is Yan Shengdi, and he owns a flower shop in Shanghai, whose brand name is "Shijing", but the location is not clear. The hospital also kindly sent a recent photo of him.</p>
<p>Later, we learned from the Shanghai Flower and Tree Commercial Association that there was a "Shixin" flower shop at 154 Chongqing South Road, and the shop owner's surname was Ni and his name was Shengqi, which was similar to the target to be investigated. Then we went to visit him with full hope.</p>
<p>When the reporter was about to run to the intersection not far from Chongqing South Road, a medium-sized jeep sped past and brushed past him, which was a thrilling scene. There are regulations limiting the speed of vehicles in downtown areas, but unfortunate citizens are often sacrificed at the hands of such lawless drivers!</p>
<p>Walking into the Shixin flower shop, we found Ni Shengqi. After inquiring, it turned out to be Ni's son. Ni was so happy that he could not express his joy when he learned that his child, who had been missing for five years, was still alive. The reporter has been running around for several days and is very excited to have achieved this. Before leaving, Ni told the reporter that he would go to Suzhou to recognize him in a few days and would donate to the Wu County Baptist Orphanage as much as he could, and he was especially grateful to the anonymous reader who wrote the letter. More details will be continued.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse into Zhejiang Province's Fisheries</h3>
<p>— He Xiaoquan</p>
<p>[Xiaoshan, 16th] At a time when calls to develop industries and save the economy from crisis are resonating loudly, Zhejiang's main products such as silk and tea have attracted the attention of people in society, but the fishing industry, which ranks first in the country, has yet to be discussed. As a reporter born in eastern Zhejiang, I would like to provide a report on the general situation of Zhejiang's fisheries based on my limited observations. Zhejiang Province borders the East China Sea. Although its area is smaller than other provinces, its coastline and</p>
<p>aquatic products</p>
<p>are the richest in the country. Its superior conditions include a mild climate, the passage of warm and cold currents, a central location, many freshwater rivers, original alluvial deposits rich in organic matter for breeding, and all the necessities for the reproduction of perennial organisms. Other factors such as the scattered coastal islands, cultural development, and convenient transportation are all essential for the development of fisheries. The winding ports, deep bays, and strategic terrain are also essential for establishing coastal defense and should not be ignored. In the Father of the Nation's hand-drafted industrial plan, the eastern major port, the third-class ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou, and the fishing ports of Changtu and Shipu, among the fifteen fishing ports, are all located in Zhejiang's waters. In order to consolidate national defense and develop the economy, we should gradually strive to complete them. Aquatic product enterprises can be divided into fishing, aquaculture, processing and manufacturing, and transportation departments, which are described below.</p>
<p>The key elements are fishing boats, fishing gear, fishing grounds, and talent and capital. Other factors such as fishing seasons and fishing methods should also be noted. Fishing boats are the main tool for fishing. Zhejiang fishermen, aware of their weak capital, make do with what they have and continue to use old-style canvas boats, which can only be used in coastal waters, are highly dangerous, and have a small catch. Before the war, new-style steam trawlers were used, but they were almost completely lost during the war. At a time when people's livelihoods are declining and fishermen cannot even get enough to eat, they are even less able to raise huge sums to purchase fishing boats. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will expand fishing loans and revitalize the fishing industry. Fishing gear can be divided into nets, hooks, and miscellaneous fishing gear, which differ depending on the boat used and the region. There are many types of nets, too numerous to list. The fish caught with nets are mostly large yellow croaker, small yellow croaker, , ribbonfish, squid, etc. There are also different types of hooks. The fish caught are ribbonfish, silverfish, , eel, bream, etc. The fishing grounds are in the area around Xishan, Zhoushan, Heishan, and Yuhuan Islands. Zhapu, Shenjiamen, Haimen, and Wenzhou are the four major fishing areas. Ningshen, Taizhou, and Wenzhou are the three major fishery administrative regions. The fishing season in Zhejiang's coastal areas is April and August for large yellow croaker, January to March and August to December for small yellow croaker, April and May for squid, March to June for shrimp, and August to December for ribbonfish, crabs, and eels. The fishing methods involve using various methods to concentrate fish so that a large amount of fish can be caught. At a time when science is flourishing and methods are constantly improving, stubborn fishermen still rely on old methods. In the future, it seems that we should abandon our shortcomings and learn from others to make up for our deficiencies.</p>
<p>Aquaculture</p>
<p>can be divided into deep-water and shallow-water types, as well as those in brackish water. This is still based on the habits of the organisms. In Zhejiang, the razor clams of Jia'ao and the blood clams of Fenghua are the most famous in saltwater. They are also farmed in Sanmen Bay, and their seedlings come from Qingjiangdu in Wenzhou. The next most important are Songmen. There is also aquaculture of laver and kelp along the coast, and there is currently a large output. In freshwater, there are the Qiantang River, Cao'e River, Ou River, and Feiyun River, etc. There are many rivers, lakes, and swamps that can be used to raise black carp, silver carp, ribbonfish, carp, etc. The raising of fish fry is very developed in Linghu, Huzhou, which is more than enough to supply the entire province. In addition to Linghu, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Huzhou, and Yinxian are also quite famous for adult fish farming.</p>
<p>Processing</p>
<p>and manufacturing can be divided into two types: food and industrial products. For food product manufacturing, the salting and drying processes in Dinghai, Daishan, Shipu, Juexi, Haimen, and Wenzhou are relatively well-known. However, products such as canned goods and cod liver oil are still lacking. Transportation is the main condition for expanding business. Zhejiang has the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways. The Sujia and Hangzhou-Ningbo railways are being planned for restoration, and the Hangzhou-Wenzhou railway will soon begin construction. Highways are known to be developed, and waterways can smoothly connect major coastal commercial ports. There are many rivers within the territory, and transportation is convenient. However, refrigerated vehicles and ships are still being added. Zhejiang has all the conditions for developing fisheries, such as fishing, aquaculture, processing and manufacturing, transportation, and salt, and is better than other provinces. What is urgently needed now is nothing more than economy and talent. Although the Fisheries Administration Office has a large amount of fishery materials, it has been reported that it has allocated several canning factories and cod liver oil factories in the Zhoushan Islands, but the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan has already closed down. It is not known when this promise will take effect, which makes those who love and are dedicated to fisheries anxious.</p>
<p>Talent</p>
<p>The government is working hard to cultivate talent, such as the re-employment of demobilized military officers and the establishment of schools at all levels, which are all progressing separately. However, it will only be successful if fishermen are taught new methods and skills and cooperate with each other. If Zhejiang's fisheries can be fully developed, the economic problems can be easily solved, and the national economy and people's livelihood can be guaranteed. The wise government should not abandon this rich natural resource.</p>
<h3>Brief Notes from Guiyang</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's airmail from Guiyang, 18th] With Guiyang as the center, the cost of living in provinces in all directions is higher than in Guiyang, no matter how important the city. Some time ago, all the officials, gentry, and merchants who could escape from all over the country, as long as they had a little relationship in Guiyang that they could use, flocked to this place where life was the cheapest. In less than two months, according to the report of the Municipal Government Statistics Office, the population of Guiyang unknowingly increased by twenty to thirty thousand people. Guiyang, which prospered because of the War of Resistance against Japan and declined because of the victory, is now lively again! The originally serious housing shortage is now becoming more serious. In the past, rents were quoted in legal tender and gold yuan, but the landlords immediately switched to real objects. Later, they felt that white rice could not rise to the price of gold and silver dollars, so they switched to gold bars and silver dollars. The local court and the police station are constantly handling rental disputes, which is unbearable. Recently, the most prosperous and lively business in Guiyang is the buying and selling of silver dollars. The clanging sound can be heard everywhere, and there are crowds of people. Civil servants and their families in the province and city are almost all involved in this business. Some are trying to preserve the value of their currency so that they can sell it easily when they need it, while others are purely because they can make a profit several times over. Standing in the silver dollar market for one or two hours a day yields more than half a year's income. No matter how the Provincial Capital Police Bureau disperses silver dollar vendors all day and all night, those who seek this silver profit can still be seen everywhere. Small people such as workers have no ability to do this, so they try their best to take turns to serve, using their time to fetch water, cook, do chores, sell newspapers in the afternoon, and work as retail vendors in the evening to make a living by selling rice and flour. Superiors sympathize with their subordinates, and officials sympathize with the workers. Public affairs are nothing more than a formality, and everyone is "tacitly aware" and no one asks anyone for "administrative efficiency."</p>

<h3>Relieving the Shortage of Paper Money: Silver and Money Businesses Suggest to the National Bank that It Issue Fixed-Amount Bank Drafts; Face Value Will Be Temporarily Divided into Four Types; the National Bank Agrees to Consider It</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] The silver, money, and trust industries in this city believe that the shortage of paper money has not been resolved in the past two weeks, and that the end of the month is approaching, so the need for cash will increase sharply. However, the National Bank still limits the withdrawal of cash to 10% to 12% of deposits from silver and money businesses every other day, so there is no way to fundamentally solve the shortage of paper money in the short term. Since all sectors feel that cash turnover is difficult, and silver and money businesses often have to deposit nine times the amount of cash in the National Bank due to the need for cash, which affects the scheduling of funds, they have informally discussed with the National Bank authorities, requesting that in addition to issuing cash as much as possible, if there is a shortage, they can only request the issuance of fixed-amount bank drafts from the Central Bank. The National Bank authorities had also long considered issuing fixed-amount bank drafts to make up for the shortage of cash. Now, in light of the suggestion from silver and money businesses, they have agreed to consider it. It is reported that the fixed-amount bank drafts are planned to be of four types: 5,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan. If the authorities do not issue large-denomination banknotes with huge face values, and the Central Printing Plant's production capacity cannot meet the needs, then the issuance of fixed-amount bank drafts will definitely be realized in the short term.</p>
<p>It is also learned that after the silver, money, and trust industries suggested to the Central Bank that it issue fixed-amount bank drafts, they have already drafted a plan. Once the various public associations have made the final verification, they will submit it to the National Bank authorities for reference.</p>
<h3>National Bank Sells Limited Gold, and Gold Prices Reach Repeated Peaks</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Gold's trend yesterday was very strong. The money market was unusually loose. Furthermore, because the Central Bank sold limited gold the day before, suspicions arose and rumors spread. Inside and outside the market, all parties were absorbing and pulling violently, and the market was boiling. The interbank interest rate fell, and the lending rate has already seen a continuous contraction. The gold price in Hong Kong was higher than the price in Shanghai, so people's minds were especially optimistic, and the market repeatedly moved toward a peak. The morning opened at 650 yuan. After the opening, all parties competed to absorb, and the market rose all the way, reaching a peak of 682 yuan. After the peak, the Central Bank did not sell, and the trading floor continued to pull up, and the market rose again to 684 yuan, and the intention to buy was still strong. After 11:40, the Central Bank began to sell, and people's minds immediately softened. The selling pressure on the trading floor gradually increased, and the market fell sharply, down to 678 yuan. Finally, the sale stopped, and people's minds became optimistic again, and the market rose again, firmly standing at 680 yuan at the noon close. Because the market was closed in the afternoon on Saturday, there was no trading in the market. The trend outside the market was even more optimistic than inside the market in the morning, and the trading floor was full of buying voices. The morning opened at 653 yuan, and the noon close was at 658 yuan. The delivery price for Monday afternoon opened at 755 yuan, 760 yuan. The evening close was at 753 yuan, 758 yuan.</p>
<p>US dollars opened at 13,000 yuan, 13,200 yuan in the morning. The noon close was 13,900 yuan, 14,000 yuan. The position for Monday afternoon opened at 15,100 yuan, 15,200 yuan, and closed at 15,100 yuan, 15,200 yuan.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong exchange rate opened at 1,000 yuan, 3 jiao, and 6 fen yesterday morning, and closed at the same price the night before.

<h3>National Bank Branches Send Out Excessive Funds, Resulting in Loose Monetary Conditions</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Yesterday, monetary conditions were extremely loose and excessive. The morning opened at around 50 yuan, and the various banks and businesses were generally holding long positions, and most of them were forcibly pressing prices to various parties between 50 and 60 yuan. However, the various industries were eagerly seeking to exit their long positions, and the daily interbank rate once fell to 30 to 40 yuan, which was the first time in half a month. In the afternoon, the money market turned slightly stable from loose and excessive due to the National Bank's sale of gold, and the daily interbank rate was finally between 40 and 50 yuan. Yesterday, the National Bank's treasury continued to send out more than 2.9 billion yuan. The various banks in the large clearing sent out more than 500 million yuan. The foreign merchants' banks sent out more than 100 million yuan. The various banks in the small clearing received more than 3.5 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Price Index Deposits</h3>
<p>Liu Gongyun Says He Is Considering It</p>
<p>Regarding the suggestion from the financial community in this city to the new Finance Minister Liu Gongyun to launch "gold deposits," "silver dollar deposits," and "price index deposits," Liu has already accepted and is considering launching them. According to Liu, who personally told reporters yesterday, this matter is still under discussion. There are currently no concrete measures or plans that can be announced. According to reporters who learned from responsible parties in the financial community, the authorities believe that among the suggestions from the financial community, "gold deposits" and "silver dollar deposits" face many technical difficulties and may be difficult to launch. However, "price index deposits" are very likely to be implemented. The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank are currently considering launching this matter, and it is expected that after implementation, it will definitely achieve considerable results in absorbing idle funds and stabilizing prices.</p>
<h3>Gold Market to Undergo Organizational Changes and Expansion of Business Scope</h3>
<p>The new Finance Minister and President of the National Bank Liu Gongyun returned to Shanghai from Beijing on the 25th.

In addition to reviewing the day's work, there were also important decisions on future business policies. It is reported that the organization of the gold market will undergo changes. The business scope will also be adjusted. The trust departments of banks and businesses can all act as brokers. The sale of silver dollars is also included. The trading method may adopt stock exchange methods. It is reported that the principles are no longer a problem. If it can be realized, the open market will become more sound. The Central Bank's use of the open market will also become more flexible. According to Liu, who told reporters, the supplementary measures to the financial reform plan are being studied. The urgent industrial loans to rescue the industrial and commercial crisis will be expanded in scope, and detailed measures are also being formulated. However, it has not yet been decided whether to adopt a ordering or acquisition method.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Market Robust</h3>
<p>The raw silk market rose sharply yesterday, and the interbank interest rate suddenly fell, and retail investors started buying domestic goods again. No. 120 had new silk goods. The morning opened at 2.73 million yuan for spot goods. It once rose to a high of 20 million yuan. The market has reached a peak, and bulls frequently sold off, and the market softened slightly. Near noon, the news of a sharp rise in gold prices boosted the market again. The noon close was still at 2.72 million yuan. The next-day position was made at 2.935 million yuan. The raw silk exchange rate continued to rise, and people's minds were optimistic. Superior grade opened at 3.95 million in the morning, and then rose all the way to 4.2 million at the noon close.</p>
<p>The silk and satin market was flat yesterday, and there were many retail sales. The market did not improve much. Huaqiang's cover cloth opened at 1.9 million in the morning, and then fell back 10,000 yuan. The trend was very flat. Recently, the news of a sharp rise in joint gold improved people's minds, but actual sales were still sluggish, and there was a lack of momentum to rise. The noon close was finally at 1.905 million yuan.</p>

<h3>White Rice Breaks 70,000 Yuan; Flour and Cooking Oil Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was affected by the weekend and the addition of two days' interest, so the vendors pushed up prices aggressively. In addition, the holiday on Monday and good sales from all parties, as well as the lead of gold, made people's minds quite high. In particular, white rice broke the 70,000 yuan mark, and Wuxi white rice reached a peak of 71,500 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of cooking oil continued to rise sharply, and the shortage of goods was serious. In addition, the money market was loose, so the vendors pushed up prices even more aggressively. All grades of goods rose by 20%. Factory soybean oil broke the 400,000 yuan mark, vegetable oil reached 360,000 yuan, and Jiton vegetable oil was out of stock. Small cart sesame oil was 486,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose 4,000 yuan, with Changzi at 27,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of flour gradually rose sharply. With the easing of monetary conditions, both actual sales and retail sales were brisk. In addition, with the holiday on Monday, vendors calculated at three days' interest, so they pushed up prices aggressively. Old Che flour rose by 10%, with Bingship flour at 26,150 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of miscellaneous grains rose sharply. The price of soybeans rose sharply due to the crazy rise in Tongri oil cake. People's minds were firm, and the money market was loose, so the market had strong buying interest. Che beans rose sharply by 20%, and the future market shouted a price of 73,600 yuan. The supply of Shengshi beans was extremely scarce, and prices generally rose by 15%. Sesame and corn had very good actual sales, and prices generally rose by about 20%. Mung beans rose by 10,000 yuan, and red beans broke the 30,000 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Tea Market Lively and Robust</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] According to people in the tea industry, tea stocks are almost exhausted. At the same time, it is learned that tea-producing areas in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, are already brewing plans to value this year's new tea, which has not yet been put on the market, in terms of white rice. Roughly, each dan of new tea requires more than eight shi of white rice. Therefore, the minds of the vendors have become even more excited, and the intention to sell the small amount of old tea in their hands has resurfaced, resulting in a strange shortage of supply, a decline in transactions, but the market atmosphere is still comparable to the foreign exchange remittance certificates, and it is exceptionally lively and robust. As for this year's new Longjing tea in Wenzhou, it is said to be continuously produced in the source area. The price among traders is still 8,000 yuan per jin, which is not much different from before.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Rises Again After the trend of tung oil turned flat some days ago, the market's rising trend was reignited yesterday, and there was a momentum of being out of control. The reason for this is that the money market in the industry has become increasingly flooded, and the price of materials outside the industry has reached its peak, resulting in crazy price increases, and the shouting price is like a runaway horse. As a result, the range of increase was wider than before, ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and the foundation was quite solid.</p>
<p>Recently, according to people in the industry, the China Trust Bureau is again purchasing sufficient tung oil to pay for exports abroad, and it is reported that the purchase price is 1 jiao and 7 fen and 6 li US dollars.</p>
<h3>Spring Overcoat Fabric Expensive and Scarce</h3>
<p>The circulation of spring overcoat fabrics in the market has been quite small recently, and it is very difficult for buyers to search for new colors. In addition to Hum Four, Harris, Herringbone, and Real and Fake Master Po Trix, there is a severe lack of suitable woolen fabrics. Even the above-mentioned brands lack those of good quality and fresh colors. Imported goods have not arrived for a long time, and local factories are seeking a way out for thin woolen papers, and are not paying attention to wool overcoat fabrics. Those that are occasionally produced are also ordinary, low-end goods below 10,000 to 20,000 yuan per yard, resulting in a situation where the sellers hoard old goods and blindly shout high prices.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Traders Handling Cloth</h3>
<p>Taiwanese traders have been handling woolen cloths quite a lot in the past few days. The woolen cloths are limited to light-colored and thin qualities for men and women, and there is no business for high-end, thick qualities. The cloths are mostly gunny cloth, white canvas, Aihua flannel, Four Various threads, and Yousheng flannel, etc. Yesterday, the transaction price of Yousheng flannel was 8,000 yuan per yard, Four Various threads 3,500 yuan, and canvas 7,000 yuan, Huayi hemp adhesive 4,500 yuan, Zhang Flower flannel 65,000 yuan, Shuang Mao Bizhi 54,000 yuan, Yihua Grey Huarang 70,000 yuan, and Fen Long Fan Lixi 35,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Price Increase Outside the Circle; Shanghai Shares Firm at the Close</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] The Shanghai stock market was weak but firm yesterday, and all stocks closed at high prices. Initially, it was heard that monetary conditions were still loose and excessive, and the gold market outside the circle was rising sharply, and the bulls were strong. However, because of concerns about the threat of the Central Bank's gold sales, and because of the double negative interest rates for leaving the market on Tuesday, the buying interest was brewing and not released, and the market mostly took a wait-and-see approach, and the market hovered at a flat level. Later, it was heard that the idle funds outside the circle had strong potential, and the gold market rebounded after being suppressed, so the various parties took advantage of the low prices to enter the market, and the buying pressure on the floor suddenly increased. Yongsha opened at 7.35 yuan in the morning. After the opening, the overnight bulls turned short, and the market softened, reaching a low of 7.06 yuan. After the low, the prices of goods outside the circle rose across the board, and the market improved. The bulls and bears struggled, and the market fluctuated at around 7 yuan, 3 jiao. Later, the news of gold sales was transmitted, and the market softened once, falling back to 7 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. Near noon, it was heard that the amount of gold sales was not large, and the gold price rebounded sharply, and the market became lively. The buying pressure rose from all sides, and the market rose sharply, finally closing at a high price of 7.95 yuan at noon.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks were absorbed by retail investors in the morning, and the market was still flat. It was once weak in the middle, but all rose at the close. Xinguang opened at 6 jiao and 7 fen, and then fell to 6 jiao and 5 fen, before rising to the limit of 8 jiao at the close. Jingfu Qinxing Meiya opened and closed higher, and the innerwear was 2 jiao and 4 fen, rising to 2 jiao and 9 fen, and the remaining stocks were all strong at the close.</p>
<p>Resumption of After-Hours Market on Monday</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange has decided to resume after-hours trading from Monday (the 28th). It has been learned that regarding the date of resumption of the after-hours market, if customers request it, brokers can apply to the exchange for settlement procedures for next-day delivery transactions that are discussed and completed in the afternoon. Yongsha, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang will be used as pilot projects. The above measures will only be implemented for those applied for by customers.</p>
<p>Foreign Shares and Gold Bonds Rise</p>
<p>The foreign stock market was showing a firm trend, the money market was easing, and the buying interest was very strong. The gold price rose, and people's minds were especially optimistic. The various stocks rose sharply at noon. Yisha was made at 19,000 yuan, 19,500 yuan, and 19,500 yuan, an increase of 3,500 yuan. English Union 23,000 yuan, 25,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan.

The gold bonds opened at 380,000 bid, 390,000 ask in the morning, and rose to 415,000 yuan in the middle, closing at 430,000 yuan. The market was closed on Saturday after that.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Hit New Highs, Cotton Cloth Fluctuations Narrow</h3>
<p>The yarn market rebounded sharply, mainly because it had been weak for several days, and many people were taking advantage of the low prices to buy in. In addition, the money market was flooded with capital, and the market discount rate even fell to around 40 yuan. As a result, people's hearts were restless, and buyers scrambled to purchase yarn. Holders were unwilling to sell, leading to a supply shortage and soaring market prices. The prices of various yarns reached unprecedented new highs.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose from 4.37 million yuan to close at 4.53 million yuan, a jump of 410,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn also rose by 420,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn opened at 2.9 million yuan in the morning and then surged past the 3 million mark, settling at 3.12 million yuan, a gain of 370,000 yuan.</p>
<p>20-count Double Horse spot yarn started at 2.23 million yuan. News of the surge in "red gold" then spread, and holders uniformly raised their asking prices. The price then rose all the way to 2.425 million yuan, a gain of 370,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 340,000 yuan. Other brands, such as Golden Rooster and Heavenly Maiden, were traded at around 2.2 million yuan, and 16-count yarns of all grades broke through the 2 million mark.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of cotton cloth remained largely unchanged, with very narrow price fluctuations. Although there were reports of rising prices for "red boiled" cloth and a flooded money market, people's spirits were not lifted, and the market remained dull and lifeless. Speculators had no intention of either buying or selling. Trading on this street was quiet, and few customers inquired about prices. The final prices of various cloths rose slightly, but were barely enough to offset the discount rate.</p>
<p>Dragon Head fine cloth rose from 85,500 yuan all the way to 88,000 yuan at closing, a gain of 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. There were no transactions for Trumpet Boy fine cloth. Five Blessings fine cloth also rose by 2,000 yuan. In addition, Large Double Dragon and Three Peaches fine cloth each rose by around 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge opened at 82,800 yuan and briefly rose to 83,100 yuan. The midday closing price was 83,000 yuan, a gain of 2,600 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Serge was priced at 81,000 yuan, a gain of 2,000 yuan. Yesterday, because most holders felt the market price was too low, they were unwilling to sell cheaply, so trading was very sluggish, and no one was willing to open positions in unpopular grades.</p>

<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>— By a Spectator</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange Works Hard to Boost Morale and Promotes Trading Through Rewards and Penalties</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Stock Exchange issued five market announcements in a row, numbered 659 to 663. Two of these announcements encouraged brokers to increase their trading volume as much as possible. Otherwise, they would be fined, and even have their trading suspended. If they did a lot of business, they would be given bonuses.</p>
<p>Last week, trading on the Stock Exchange was extremely sluggish, which caused stock prices to plummet.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market suddenly improved. Although we mentioned on Thursday that a surge might occur in the next few days, these two announcements about penalties and rewards were clearly very effective.</p>
<p>Yesterday, not only did the stock market improve, but the general market was also aiming for a high point.</p>
<p>The market always has the younger generation pushing the older generation forward. "Aiming for" is just an empty phrase that can never be taken as real.</p>
<p>In the past ten days or so, rice and coal have stood out, while others have paled in comparison. Therefore, we believe that they will aim for higher prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, general market prices were catching up rapidly. The younger generation pushed the older generation forward, and the rise in rice and coal prices was even stronger.</p>
<p>The rise in rice and coal prices was by no means accidental. We have long pointed out that, considering the authorities' various measures to ensure price increases, and considering the overall environment, prices had to rise.</p>
<p>Gold, banknotes, silver dollars, and rice and coal are the same. Within the overall environment, rising prices are a natural trend, which we have repeatedly pointed out.</p>
<p>A general price increase has already begun. However, spectators must not be infatuated.</p>
<p>We pointed out on Wednesday the "regular trend," which is "Knock out goods a week in advance, release discount interest rates to prepare for positions, this is the urgency of the near term."</p>
<p>To knock out goods and reverse positions, there must first be a price surge. Therefore, yesterday's price surge must be fully utilized, but one must also be careful every step of the way.</p>
<p>We have also repeatedly pointed out that, paying attention to the overall environment, one must be careful because heavy and light items have very different fates. Although "aiming for" is a necessity under the principle of balanced commodity prices, it is meaningless if it only evens out on paper and lacks real implementation.</p>
<p>Because yesterday's price surge may be larger than most people expect, it is necessary to remember these basic conditions. Getting dizzy is highly inappropriate.</p>
<p>Isn't there a date, a location, and people involved in the peace talks?</p>
<p>Everyone hopes for peace, and hopes for it fervently. Therefore, good prospects for prices dilute the environment of tight winds and heavy rain.</p>
<p>Yesterday's price surge is undeniably related to this. But, ah, there are many facts to consider carefully. That was the case in the past, and it is still the case now. Therefore, the realization of the peace talks can be likened to catching sand crabs, requiring everyone to lay their cards on the table.</p>
<p>Laying the cards on the table determines the win or loss, which also determines peace or war; the rebound in the market is self-evident.</p>
<p>Lay cards, catch sand crabs, a price surge, you must be careful.</p>

<h3>Basketball League Situation Settled: China United Defeats Shiyu to Secure Top Spot</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In last night's basketball league match between China United and Shiyu, China United won 46-34. The half-time score was 18-16. Although China United still has two games left, they are inconsequential.</p>
<p>There was a large crowd of fans at the stadium last night, and ticket sales totaled 2.201 million yuan. There were 300 reserved seats, 1,500 downstairs seats, and 500 upstairs seats. The scene was unprecedented, and it is estimated that there were more than 3,000 people who did not purchase tickets.</p>
<p>In the first half, the two sides were evenly matched and tied repeatedly. China United was quite troubled. In the second half, Wu Chengzhang's success, Liu Fushen's two corner shots, and Li Zhenzhong's "opportunistic steals" demoralized Shiyu. When the score was 28-23, China United was able to breathe a sigh of relief. Shiyu's overly busy substitutions gave the opponent the advantage of waiting for changes.</p>
<p>In the women's group, Xinghua defeated John by three points, 34-31. In another Group A1 match, McKinsey defeated Haiqing by a large margin, 41-20. Haiqing's appearance of Cherden Ham Spring〇 did not show any improvement.</p>
<p>Group A Championship Decided</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the match between China United and Shiyu. China United started with Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, Le Jiazhou, Liu Fushen, and Wu Chengzhang. Shiyu responded with Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongyi, Wu Xinyun, Li Zhaohe, and Shen Pengju. This match was originally scheduled for 7:15 p.m., but it actually started at 7:45 p.m.</p>
<p>The match began amidst cheers. Guozheng missed a free throw, and Xinyun scored the first point. China United's Chengzhang and Jiazhou scored four points with one shot and two free throws. Pengju then made two free throws to tie the score at four. Lao Bao stabilized the situation with another basket, 6-4, and Shiyu called their first timeout. Xinyun and Zhongyi complemented each other, making two long-range shots. Pengju also scored under the basket, 10-6, taking the lead. China United substituted Jin Sheng for Xiao Le. Jin Sheng, Zhenzhong, and Songyuan then tied the score at ten. Shiyu also temporarily rested. Then, Fushen shot, and Shiyu's Cai Jindian and Wu Xinyun made three consecutive free throws, taking the lead again at 13-12. China United's shots failed to find the basket four or five times. Lao Bao got the ball and dribbled it in, and Chengzhang lived up to expectations, 14-13, putting China United ahead by one point. Xinyun was substituted for Zhaohe. Soon after, Zhaohe entered, and Guozheng exited. Zhenzhong took advantage of a moment of leisure, Zhongyi scored, and Songyuan came again. When Xinyun scored with a free throw, the first half ended, 18-16, with China United only leading by two points.</p>
<p>In the second half, Shiyu's Guozheng and Jindian, Xinyun and Zhongyi both made long-range shots with great skill. Chengzhang tied the score at 20. Lao Bao committed a foul, and Pengju failed to make the free throw. Chengzhang then tied the score again (22), and the game entered a physical struggle. At 25-23, Huaiting substituted Zhaohe. Although China United scored another basket, they still dared not be careless. Before long, Jindian replaced Xinyun. Wu Fu scored three points, putting China United ahead 28-23, which seemed to give them some confidence. Zhenzhong and Fushen "followed the current," making the score 33-25. Xiao Le replaced Jin Sheng. Shiyu then made the same mistake again, substituting too frequently. Yao Wenyi went in and out again. In the last three minutes, the score became 44-30. Zhang Liangxiong replaced Zhenzhong. The situation was set, but Shiyu's efforts did not stop. The audience still shouted, but China United finally won 46-34.</p>

<p>Xinghua Women's Team Defeats John</p>
<p>In the opening match of the women's group, Xinghua's Wang Shan and Qian Mengyue made free throws one after another. John's Zhang Luoluo and Lin Jingyi resisted stubbornly, and the score was tied at four in an instant. Wang Shan's height gave her considerable freedom in shooting. In the first quarter, Xinghua had 12 points and John had 6 points. In the second quarter, Luoluo worked hard, and the score was only one basket away at 16-14, which startled Xinghua. The half-time score was 18-14, with Xinghua leading by four points. In the third quarter, John's Jingyi and Handa played strongly, and the score was always close. Miss Lin made a free throw, and the score was tied at 23. In this quarter, Xinghua made major substitutions, with Zhu Jiazhen replacing Cheng Zhaorui and Wang Wenjian replacing Zhu Lanzhen as defender, and Zhang Xiuli replacing Ze Lun. The third quarter ended with each team scoring 23 points. In the final quarter, everyone showed their colors, and each team scored a basket, refusing to give way. The audience did not favor one team over the other, and cheered whenever a basket was made. Qian Mengyue scored four consecutive baskets, which greatly supported Xinghua's efforts. As a result, Xinghua won 34-31.</p>

<p>Cherden Initially Shows Potential</p>
<p>Haiqing, led by Cherden Ham, appeared last night. Their tall black player, also called Brown, had the stance of the Black Whirlwind from "Water Margin," always marking McKinsey and Owen Gai closely. McKinsey, familiar with the court, forced Haiqing to call a timeout within ten minutes with a score of 10-2. Haiqing's offense was not without ferocity, but the accuracy was too poor. After ten minutes, the score was 22-5. McKinsey then substituted fresh troops. The half-time score was 29-5. Haiqing was not discouraged.</p>
<p>In the second half, Haiqing's situation improved. Li Pula became more skilled, and after the score reached 32-16, McKinsey brought on four good players, resulting in a final score of 41-20.</p>
<h3>China Aviation and Railway Clash: New Champion to Be Revealed Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Due to continuous rain over the past two weeks, the Mayor's Cup final has been postponed twice. It has been rescheduled for 3:00 p.m. today at the Yiyuan Stadium. To avoid crowding, tickets will be sold in advance at the Yiyuan entrance in the morning and at the Municipal Stadium from 12:30 p.m. There are two types of tickets, priced at 1,200 yuan and 800 yuan. At that time, the Mayor's representative, Director Zhang Peter of the Municipal Government's Confidential Office, will attend to present the awards. The Municipal Government Band will play music at the venue, and the Fourth Dimension Boy Scouts will maintain order. However, due to the recent rain, whether the match can be held can be confirmed by calling the Football Committee at 38683 and Yiyuan at 74580 or 78571.</p>
<p>Today's referee is Le, and the linesmen are Ni Xiaoben and Lu Shunde.</p>
<p>The new Cup champion will receive fifteen silver medals, and the runner-up will receive fifteen bronze medals. This year, because the defending champion, Qingbai Association, was eliminated, and the Donghua Association did not register to participate, the new champion and runner-up will likely be new teams.</p>
<p>China Aviation and Railway have been training hard during the two-week break, rain or shine. The athletes have been sharpening their skills, and the authorities have been encouraging their morale, waiting for the opportunity. Today, when they meet, both sides will use all their strength, competing in both intelligence and ability. A fierce battle is inevitable.</p>
<p>Due to the rain the day before yesterday, the field is still muddy. Railway's short passing tactics are best suited for a wet field after rain. Although they have the advantage of location and more experience, whether they can repeat their triumph over China Aviation in the league match depends on the state of the players. It should be noted that in such an important final, the players must have enough energy to compete for the full 90 minutes. Luck becomes an important factor in determining victory. If Railway wants to secure victory, they must increase the speed of their wingers so that they can fly together. Then the three forwards in the center can achieve breakthroughs. With Gao Baozheng stationed in the defense, unless China Aviation has a strategy to avoid strength and attack weakness, it will be difficult to break through Lao Gao's formidable barrier.</p>
<p>The two-week break has been beneficial to China Aviation in terms of time and space. If they can borrow a player from Hong Kong, they will have a strong hope of winning the championship. Even if they do not borrow a player and only recall Zhuang Wenquan and other old players, it will still be a threat to Railway. Strategically speaking, Xu Zuguo should be used as a winger to increase the speed on both wings. To break through Gao Baozheng's iron formation, they should adopt a four-forward attack, with one forward serving as a striker. Gao Xiuqing should be in charge of the striker's duties, because Xiao Gao is skilled in controlling, passing, dribbling, and shooting, and has delicate footwork. He is a figure who the Railway defenders must pay attention to. If he can move freely in the midfield and gain control, then Railway's defense will be uneasy. Defense must be strong, and Railway's forwards must be kept outside the 15-yard line, so that Xu Fusheng can be as stable as Mount Tai. China Aviation's defense is the biggest weakness, and whether they can defeat Railway depends on whether their defense has a way to stop Railway. The lineups are as follows: (Qi Gong)</p>
<p>Railway</p>
<p>Liao Xiong</p>
<p>Yue Shixiao Wu Jiabang</p>

<h3>Qingbai and Dragon Head Halted by Rain: Qunli to Play Jingwu This Morning</h3>

Today, at 10:00 a.m., there will be a Group A league match between Qunli and Jingwu at Yiyuan. The referee is Zhu Qiu, and the linesmen are Zhang Zhishi and Li Guoyi. Jingwu and Qunli drew 1-1 in the first week of the league. Jingwu is full of vigor, while Qunli is full of experience. The two teams are evenly matched, and whoever can use the right methods will be able to win. The lineups are as follows:</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Main Team to Play Green Team Tonight: Meet Li Team</h3>
<p>The Fourth Basketball League will have three women's Group A matches as usual this weekend, starting at 5:30 p.m. at the Municipal Stadium. In the first match, the women's main team will play the Green Team again, facing the Li Team. This match is crucial for the championship prospects and should be exciting. In the final Group A1 second-round match, Huili will play Pei Fei Er. Both teams have been in excellent form recently and are at their peak. A fierce battle is inevitable when they meet. Tickets are priced as before, 500 yuan upstairs, 1,000 yuan downstairs, and 1,500 yuan for reserved seats inside the venue. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Green Team - Li Team (Women's Group) 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Donghua - Youyi (Group A2) 6:15 p.m.</p>
<p>Huili - Pei Fei Er (Group A1) 7:15 p.m.</p>
<p>In the women's main team match, the Green Team and the Li Team will meet again. The Green Team has won all six of its matches and remains undefeated, while the Li Team has also won five matches, but suffered its only defeat in the first round against the Green Team. Tonight's rematch is a narrow path for rivals, and winning will give them hope of winning the championship. Unfortunately, the team members are all short in stature. Although their skills are flexible, they still suffer a disadvantage. The Green Team's female generals are fierce as tigers, and their forwards and defenders are strong and abnormal. With such heavy responsibilities, the Li Team may be stretched thin.</p>
<p>In the second act, Donghua and Youyi will compete in Group A2. The former is always victorious, and the latter is always defeated. The game will be one-sided, without question.</p>
<p>In the final match, Huili will face Pei Fei Er in the second round of Group A1. Pei Fei Er suffered seven losses in seven games in the first round, without a single win. In the second round, they have changed completely. Except for a small setback against the Shanghai Police, they have defeated China United, McKinsey, Haiqing, and Encas in a revenge spree. Black Brown is the most dangerous, followed by Kleger Leichi and Ikate, who are all extremely brave. Huili has made great progress recently. Their victory over the Shanghai Police was not easy, and their recent defeat of Ren Yu was outstanding. Fu Hai, Zhiji, and Yongfang have accurate shooting, and their attacks are also fast. Hua Wei and Xiao Wei's collaboration is also more tacit. Tonight, these two teams with strong momentum and full of energy will give a tense performance that is worth watching. The single-player lists of the six teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Green Team) Huang Mingyuan, Shi Zonglan, Cao Manli, Zhu Jinjun, Wang Weizhen, Wu Ailian, Cao Manzhu, Wu Meiyi, Lu Weijun.</p>
<p>(Li Team) Qian Chuping, Qian Hanzhan, Zhu Cuidi, Niu Yunjuan, Yao Silian, Xu Huiyu, Chen Wenying, Cai Mingxia, Chen Yuling, Guo Maidianpei, Xu Muben, Jin Lili.</p>
<p>(Donghua) Han Longhai, Li Yao, Zhou Da, Chen Xianglong, Jia Youliang, Zhang Linggen, Zhang Banglun, Zhang Yuanji, Cai Yanxiong.</p>
<p>(Youyi) Su Shifeng, Luo Zhongzhou, Han Fei, Shi Hui, Jin Yan, Ling Zhihao, Zhang Fa, Wei Yuping, He Luo, Wang Xuewu.</p>
<p>(Huili) Zhang Pu, Tian Fuhai, Cao Zhiji, Wang Yongfang, Wei Xu, Chen Zhengyu, Hua Yunshan, Xu Shuyuan.</p>
<p>(Pei Fei Er) Klemontoye, Brown, Mu Hui, Greici, Tie Bosi, Si Tu He, Ikate, Pai Ke Si, Hua Jin Si.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Hualian Football Team to Saigon: Contribution of 180,000 Coins</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Aviation News] Regarding Hualian's trip to Saigon, although the Saigon side has formally sent a letter expressing their welcome, the Hong Kong Football Association places importance on the Hong Kong League and is deeply concerned that allowing Hualian to leave Hong Kong for two weekends, as proposed by Saigon, would have too much impact on the competition. Therefore, at the association's executive committee meeting this month, it was decided to allow Hualian to leave Hong Kong for only one weekend and stated that Hualian players must be able to participate in the Hong Kong League on April 23rd before the trip to Saigon would be approved. In response, the Chinese Football Association sent a letter to Saigon requesting a change of date. Saigon has now replied, agreeing to change the two matches to April 17th and 18th, for a total of two matches. They have also revised the guarantee of income for the Hualian team to 180,000 coins. The Chinese Football Association has scheduled an executive committee meeting at 5:45 p.m. on Tuesday, the 29th of this month, at the Holland Room to discuss the matter. If the trip is approved, representatives may also be selected at the same time.</p>

<h3>Ping Pong Knowledge (1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Wang Xinjing, Edited by Chen Linsheng</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xinjing was the editor of the pre-war "Ping Pong World" monthly magazine. The "Ping Pong Knowledge" book he edited is rich in material and lively in writing. It is a rare masterpiece among table tennis books. However, the book was completely destroyed in the war not long after it was published. Now Mr. Wang is quite disheartened and unable to consider reprinting it. He has specially granted my humble request to select the best parts and publish them in this newspaper successively. This is truly a blessing for readers who love table tennis. Please pay attention to it. Chen Linsheng</p>
<p>(1) She Always Smiles Lightly at Us</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The handsome and sparkling ping pong ball, she always smiles lightly at us.</p>
<p>The currently popular soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, high jump, javelin... are all good activities that are beneficial to the body. But we should not deny that some sports are subject to age or gender restrictions. Therefore, we often see some people who understand the importance of exercise in life and love sports. When they reach old age, even if they hold the things they love in their hands, they cannot help but feel "more flesh on the thighs." It is absolutely impossible for you to gallop on the battlefield and enjoy the fun again. It is not an empty suspicion. Old generals on the battlefield can only sit in the stands and reminisce, and can no longer experience it personally. Even if young girls have a love for some sports, they can only stand quietly on the sidelines, screaming "good" in a soft voice.</p>
<p>Our ping pong ball, which we love to play, has a beautiful appearance, and she smiles and welcomes everyone to play. If you are used to sweating a few drops, she can give you genuine satisfaction. Men can use a ping pong ball to recover from work fatigue; women can use a ping pong ball to increase family interest; old women can have a ping pong ball so that they will not be annoyed by hearing what their beloved children say.</p>
<p>(2) I Can Play With Her Anywhere</p>
<p>The fact that ping pong is not limited by age and gender has already been mentioned above. At the same time, ping pong is also a kind of sport that requires relatively simple equipment and saves a lot of money. You only need a table, a net, and your own ping pong paddle and ping pong ball. If our economy is relatively affluent and we have the power to build a standard ping pong table, that is naturally the best. If we can't, we can also use two dining tables or piece together a few boards and play comfortably and happily. If the house is large, you can play at home. Otherwise, when there is no wind, you can build her stage anywhere. With simple equipment, she can accompany us to play almost anywhere.</p>
<p>(3) Only She Can Accompany Us at Any Time</p>
<p>Because she is lively and constantly striving for self-improvement; because she loves natural beauty and does not like to decorate unnecessarily; because she sincerely wants to be close to us, so everything about her is simple and convenient. If you like her, you can put her in your pocket; if you like her, you can ask her to dance. If you feel bored or tired, she can do her best to eliminate it for you; if you are worried or distressed, she can comfort you… In short, everything about her is lovely. And only she can accompany us to dance at any time—day or night.</p>
<p>However, friends who love her must sometimes pay attention to everything besides her, so as not to let her suffer. Teachers are seriously teaching in the classroom, and children should not put her in their minds at this time, and take her out to look at her from time to time. My mind cannot have two thoughts at the same time. When doing things, I can only temporarily place her properly in a place… Unfortunately, she is discovered by the teacher in the classroom; unfortunately… it is not good to blame her for her loving nature and unwillingness to distinguish. In short, she is good, I am good, and everyone is good, which is the most important thing.</p>
<h3>US Military Forms Combined Team to Challenge China League</h3>

The Chinese League is planning a farewell commemorative match, in which the US military will combine to challenge the China League. This match will be held early next week. This match is currently being negotiated by the Basketball Committee. If it becomes a reality, it will be the most exciting basketball game of the season.</p>

<h3>Think a Step Back</h3>
<p>— Wu Deyun</p>
<p>Those who are dissatisfied with the status quo will immediately feel at peace as long as they are willing to think a step back.</p>
<p>For example, those small clerks who complain about their meager salaries only need to convert their mere tens of thousands of yuan in monthly salary into legal tender; one becomes three million, so isn't that hundreds of billions? Think a step back; before the war, even the great China probably didn't have so much paper money – is that still not enough?</p>
<p>Another example is the poor wretches who have one meal a day or none, and they feel indignant when they see others eating big fish and meat. But they have never thought that in ancient times, our ancestors could only "eat raw meat and drink blood," and they had never even eaten cooked food. It was really pitiful. Speaking a step back: Although coal briquettes are expensive now, we still don't have to eat raw food; although we have to squeeze for household rice, we still don't have to risk our lives and go to the forest to hunt for food.</p>
<p>Another example is those who are very heartbroken about corrupt officials and bureaucrats are actually very silly. Generally speaking, all within the four seas are brothers. Since we are originally one family, then what does it matter if our own people take a little money? What's more, thinking a step back: money is "an external thing," you can't bring it with you when you are born, and you can't take it with you when you die—old brother, you can be greedy if you want to, I'm happy to be generous.</p>
<p>Another example is those who feel very panicked about the recent Cold War between the two major international blocs, fearing that a third world war is bound to break out. I can only blame those people for being too narrow-minded. Because they cannot think a step back: the earth may be suddenly attacked by a flying meteor, and that kind of destruction is more terrible than a world war. So,—thinking even a step back—for example, what if the meteor has already collided with the earth? But we can actually survive to this day, isn't it already very worthy of "congratulating with hands on forehead"?</p>
<p>When thinking about everything like this, we will be very calm—although we will inevitably be scolded.</p>
<h3>Talking About Humor and Other Things</h3>
<p>— Chen Yaoguang</p>
<p>The theory of humor comes from the West. The original meaning is an expression of mood, especially a witty mood. Today, some people also interpret a sense of humor as a gentler temper. Sometimes in a situation where several people are telling jokes, after one of them gets angry, someone will often say: "We are just joking, how can you not even have this little sense of humor?" It can be seen that the use of humor is also great.</p>
<p>Humor can also be explained as a more subtle kind of slapstick, that is to say, it is a kind of slapstick that is less easily and widely understood. Slapstick is when you laugh out loud as soon as you hear it or even before you finish listening, and humor is when you laugh out loud two or three seconds after you finish listening, or even after someone points it out (except for those with particularly agile minds). Before the term humor was introduced into China, it wasn't that we didn't have humor. To put it bluntly, what the ancients called wit and humor was humor. Today's so-called sense of humor means not taking small things that are not pleasing to the ear or not pleasing to the eye too seriously. It is true that you can ask someone to bring out a sense of humor when telling jokes, but if you scold someone's ancestors and still blame them for saying, "How can you not have any sense of humor?" then that is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Dr. Lin Yutang, who is known as the master of humor, lived in the United States for many years. In addition to desperately instilling imported humor culture in China, he also sent small-footed culture abroad from time to time, in exchange for a large amount of US dollar royalties. Although Dr. Lin has been promoting humor for many years, when one of his daughters eloped with a foreigner, he was so angry that he kept panting. Where did Dr. Lin's sense of humor go? It can be seen that advocating is easy, but putting it into practice is difficult. Talking about humor is easy to say, but achieving the point of having a sense of humor is not something that can be done overnight, and even gentlemen who are full of Western culture are no exception. As noble as President Truman, if he had a good sense of humor, he would not have scolded columnist Pearson as an S.O.B. People cannot completely lose their true selves. The difficulty of humor has been proven again.</p>
<p>Modern people like to follow trends, yearning for humor and doing their best to create imitations, but in the end they are just imitations, and they are not from their nature, so most of them are not well-done. The development of a sense of humor depends half on talent and half on training. Moreover, humor must also be used in the right place. Otherwise, if you suffer a big loss from others and still smile indifferently thinking that you have a sense of humor, then it is simply unbearable.</p>
<h3>East Scale and West Claw</h3>
<p>— Cang Yi</p>
<p>Tolstoy's handwriting was very scrawled and often changed. No one but his wife could understand his original manuscript. His wife had rewritten his "War and Peace" manuscript seven times. Whether the wooden pillars supporting the power lines, buried underground, are decayed and need to be replaced can now be determined after first using X-rays to inspect them at night.</p>
<h3>Price Reduction</h3>
<p>— Dian Chen</p>
<p>In this day and age, the term "price reduction" seems very unfamiliar. Apart from being used by merchants as a business gimmick, it can be said that it has been rarely heard of for a long time.</p>
<p>It is rare for the two road bureaus to favor it, and this cannot but make people feel excited.</p>
<p>But I also feel that this "reduction" seems not to be a natural one.</p>
<p>Despite saying it so beautifully: "Reducing the burden on passengers," in fact, it is just to reduce the burden on first-class passengers.</p>
<p>As for third-class passengers? There is no mention of it later.</p>
<h3>Strange Tales of Plants</h3>
<p>— Cang Yi</p>
<p>The soil in Australia is mostly composed of calcium sulphate. Cereals grow on it, and if some calcium sulphate is not applied, they will never bear grain. But they need very little copper sulphate, only a few grams per hundred acres of cereals. Bananas are not like peaches, plums, plums, and apricots, which have a hard kernel. But in eastern Java, there is a kind of stone banana, which is no more than four and a half inches long, and contains one hundred and ten to dozens of kernels the size of mung beans.</p>
<p>The oldest tree in the world is a silk fir tree in Hagga, Mexico, with a circumference of one hundred and seventy-five feet and an age of about ten thousand years. It is still growing very luxuriantly. Its wood weighs one million two hundred and eight thousand pounds, enough to build more than twenty foreign houses.</p>
<p>A strange cucurbitaceous plant growing on the coast of the Mediterranean and northern Africa is called the "spray melon." When its fruit matures, it automatically separates from the pedicel and shoots the fruit a long distance away.</p>
<h3>The Wonderful Use of the Eight-legged Essay</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>The eight-legged essay also has its wonderful uses.</p>
<p>Reason: The eight-legged essay is a set of ready-made and fixed formulas. With it, complex and complicated problems can be turned into simple and easy to understand. As long as you are familiar with and use that set of formulas, it is not difficult to get the answer. And the answer produced by the formula must be only one, and there is no distinction.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I often discovered the wonderful use of the eight-legged essay when writing essays in Chinese class: no matter what topic the teacher gave, I always said a few words from the "positive" aspect, then a few words from the "negative" aspect, and then "combined" them to get a conclusion. It was not difficult to make, and it always worked.</p>
<p>Living today, reading books and newspapers, dealing with people, and even writing essays and speaking are not easy, but if you understand the wonderful use of the eight-legged essay, everything will not be a problem.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about reading books and newspapers:</p>
<p>Today's books, newspapers, and periodicals are so numerous in variety and quantity, so different in statements, so different in tones, and so different in the terms and jargon used to explain ancient and modern theories, that they are all dizzying. Moreover, the economic burden cannot be sustained, the mental strength cannot cope, and the time cannot be allocated. Especially in today's "prices are keeping up with interest rates," our small citizens and public teachers have to find ways to maintain a little bit of their currency value even if they don't do business. Every day, they inevitably have to run to Henan Road to ask about the "big head" market. Where can they have enough time and energy to carefully chew on the various annotations of "democracy" and "freedom," or to check the origins of "Cold War" and "Hot War"? This one is right, that one is wrong, one alliance in the East, one alliance in the West… These are not things that we can explore calmly with one brain, one pair of eyes, and one pair of ears. In desperation, we have to find a set of eight-legged essays, a formula, in the complicated and chaotic world, and be determined to read one type of book, read one type of newspaper, and listen to one type of voice, without being indecisive. If we can do this, many difficult problems will be solved easily.</p>
<p>As Mr. Lu Xun said, if there are "taboos" in reading, reading two opposite books at the same time will cause the positive and negative to cancel each other out due to the incompatible qualities, which is equivalent to not reading. Then, the "eight-legged essay method" is even more miraculous. In this way, the places where we should rely on the "eight-legged essay" to deal with people, write articles, and speak are even more beyond words.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, "roughnecks" always liked to use this logic to argue and scold with people: "Damn it, during the Anti-Japanese War, military affairs are the first priority, and I represent the country. If you insult me, you are insulting the country!" The other party often remained silent because of this. It can be seen that the pursuit of the eight-legged essay has long been widely popular, but it is especially urgently needed today.</p>
<p>But what should be stated is: the eight-legged essay has timeliness and mechanical locality, and its usage varies according to time and place. What was suitable in the past is not suitable today, and what is suitable in other places is not suitable here. When using it, we must try to adapt it!</p>
<h3>I Obtained a Line of Poetry About Broken Flowers in a Dream. I Woke Up and Suddenly Felt Something, So I Completed a Poem in Regular Verse to Express My Feelings</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>Since spring, I have often complained about the east wind, which is uncertain in its weather. The small grass is still green at will, and the broken flowers still bloom red with affection. The mountains and rivers are separated, but how far away are they? It is always empty when meeting is difficult. Day after day, I think of you and I am getting old. I will give my life to the vastness of the universe! Sent to Mr. Bao Tianxiao in Taiwan</p>
<p>(Rhyming with Yan Qiao)</p>
<p>The vast Central Plains has sunk, the wind and rain torment and encroach on each other. I envy you for leaving high footprints on Peng Island, and I, old, think of my heart in the desolate river. Nothing is better than planting bamboo to dispel boredom, and I am not allowed to go deep into the mountains because I love my home. When will we re-order a flower-watching appointment, and set up wine in front of the flowers to drink together in detail?</p>

<p>The evening newspaper reported that the living index for the first half of March was 1339.36 times.</p>
<p>The living index has been published. Gold notes are jumping wildly, oil and rice are soaring, the stock market is rising, and the exchange rate is rising. Public utilities will have to be adjusted tomorrow. The index cannot keep up with prices, and the base salary is too small. Half a month's income is not enough to pay off debts. Dumai has risen above the 40,000 mark, and silver dollars are selling for 4,800 yuan. I have a headache in the office.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, go inside to get your salary."</p>
<p>"Oh," I walked into the accounting office and got my salary bag for this month. I felt very strange. Why is it so thin? So light? I suspiciously opened it, and it was a 35,000 yuan bank draft!</p>
<p>Is this half month of hard work just a piece of waste paper?</p>
<p>Cash has been particularly short these days, but I need cash! First, I owe the landlady the rent calculated in four dou of rice; second, I borrowed three big heads from the company's cook, and I agreed to pay them back after payday. If I break my promise for the first time, it will be difficult to open my mouth to him again if I need it urgently next time.</p>
<p>In the accounting office, I stared blankly at the bank draft.</p>
<p>"There is very little cash, and the banks are short of cash." The accountant told me seriously. I originally wanted to discuss it with him, but he said it first, which made me embarrassed to open my mouth. So, I had to walk out of the accounting office silently.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Who else has cash?</p>
<p>I thought of Little Wang: "Brother, do you have cash? Can you think of a way to get this bank draft?"</p>
<p>"Cash? The money I buy cigarettes with is still arranged by the tea room."</p>
<p>Little Wang mentioned the tea room, and I remembered that he often had extra money for delivering goods, maybe he would have cash. I decided to go to him to set up a plan. Unexpectedly, he had just gone out to deliver goods, and there was no fixed time for his return.</p>
<p>Secretary Gu usually has a lot of dealings with banks and is very popular outside. It might be a good idea to try to find him. Damn it! He is on the phone. "...The company issues salary in bank drafts. Ah! Where is there any cash? Hey! No..." Secretary Gu said on the phone.</p>
<p>I pushed the door in, but he didn't notice. I happened to hear this phone call, so why bother asking for trouble? So, I quietly returned.</p>
<p>The tea room has already returned. I hurried over.</p>
<p>"Hey! Is there a way to exchange this bank draft for cash?"</p>
<p>He was stunned, looked at the face of the draft and said: "The amount is not enough, I only have more than 5,000 yuan."</p>
<p>"Then are you free to buy three big heads?"</p>
<p>He nodded, took the bank draft, and walked out.</p>
<p>It was dark, and everyone in the company had gone home. I was still waiting.</p>
<p>The tea room came back and said: "Buying silver dollars requires cash, not bank drafts."</p>
<p>I walked to the tobacco shop myself: "Buy a carton of Bank Brand cigarettes." The boss saw me take out a bank draft and said with a smile: "The change needs to be calculated at 10% off, otherwise, buy all cigarettes."</p>
<p>"God! This bank draft ah..."</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The next morning, I was still sleeping in bed. The landlady deliberately smiled and said: "The price of rice has risen by another 7,000 yuan today." She said and smiled again.</p>
<p>However, I can't blame him for this mocking speech. It's just that I owe people rent money, which is not good.</p>
<p>I quickly went to my cousin's shop and begged him to exchange cash to help me out. He promised to pick it up in the afternoon, and my heart was finally half at peace. Along the way, I inquired about the price of silver coins. The big head has already sold for 5,000 yuan! I hope it doesn't rise again.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I asked the company for leave to get the money. Fortunately, because of our good relationship, there was no discount, and I got 35,000 yuan in cash. I brought the money back.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>I hurried to buy the big heads. When I walked to the corner of Henan Road, the new price list was posted again.</p>
<p>"Big head sold for 6,500."</p>
<p>"Can you make it cheaper?" I asked.</p>
<p>"How many are you buying?"</p>
<p>"Buy three big heads, how much?"</p>
<p>"19,000 yuan, is it cheap?"</p>
<p>I paid him 19,000 yuan and bought three big heads. Under the dim sunlight, the three big heads were shining in my hand.</p>
<p>The evening newspaper news came again: "Dumai has risen above the 50,000 mark."</p>
<p>I took out the remaining 16,000 yuan and calculated the price of four dou of rice: this number made me shiver in the evening breeze.</p>
