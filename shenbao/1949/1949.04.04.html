<p>〔本報南京三日電〕和談業在北平逐漸展開，京中政局暫呈平靜，政界人士除對華中緊張之戰局表示特別關懷外，卽以最大之熱忱，期待北平和談之成就，京·平間雖日有電訊聯絡，但以中共對商談新聞持絕對秘密性，故商談進行期中，實際問題之研討情形，外間甚少知悉，惟有若干人士頃正積極期待自北平發出之停戰命令，以實現真正之和平，但觀察家認為：當前和談首要課題自為停戰問題，但停戰必涉及整編軍隊，亦卽與毛澤東之八項條件有關，是以停戰顯非易事。另據某監委表示，根據渠就近一週來戰局共軍進攻情形看來，渠幾懷疑有「打打談談」情況重演之可能，渠對和談前途表現甚大之消極，此種看法，與樂觀於期待停戰令卽日頒發之人如同樣具有無限矛盾，而此兩種情況，在首都政界人十中到處皆有。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕李代總統三日晨九時在傳厚惴邀集可應欽·閻錫山·童冠賢·白崇禧等四人會談，商討和平大計，迄十二時始散。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京三日電〕本社頃自北平接獲無線電話報告，知悉正式和談尚未開始，雙方代表僅事初步交換意見。又悉：李代總統昨晚曾與在北平之政府和談代表通長途電話，此間關係方面透露，雙方代表彼此作私人性的拜訪，甚為友好。又訊：政府不久卽將設立諮詢委員會，以代表參加和談之政府代表團作最後決定。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港二日電〕據有資格之左翼人士指陳，北平和平談判，可能在下週卽告結束。據悉：共黨代表對於毛澤東提出之八項條件，除懲處戰犯一點可能略為緩和外，餘均不允讓步。共軍統帥部已利用兩月以來戰事之沉寂，完成渡江之準備，而以切斷京滬兩地為其初步目標。此間傳說共黨曾在香港購買相當數量之汽油，以供其裝甲部隊之用。此等部隊之配備，係自政府軍方面獲得，似將參加共軍對於長江流域之進攻。</p>
<h3 id="c2">中航公司平滬間復航　原則大致無問題　吳福咸返滬對記者談話　北平市面蕭條人民生活轉崇樸素 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕此次載送政府和談代表團飛平之中航公司專機C64型XT122號，昨晚七時十分飛返滬。該機一日下午三時十分抵平後，原定翌日返滬，旋因事多留一天，至昨日下午二時卅分始離平，五時許抵京，停留片刻，七時十分飛抵上海龍華機塲。此次隨機返滬者僅原隨該機飛平之正副機師二人，電訊員一人，空中小姐二人及擬與中共洽談通航問題之中航公司上海售票處副延長吳福成。該機並帶來少數郵件，昨日各人下機後，在塲之警備人員檢查甚為嚴密，卽空中小姐之行李亦不能免。</p>
<p>據吳福咸稱：此次渠代表中航公司赴平，與中共方面洽商通航問題，初步接觸，頗為順利，復航原則上大致無問題。記者詢以具體辦法，吳氏僅稱前途樂觀，其他須待向公司當局提出報告後，方能有更具體之發表。</p>
<p>吳氏又稱：此次政府和談代表團乘該機飛平，故接獲自京起飛時間之電訊後，經估計飛抵平時間，故一早卽有中共各關係方面之人士在機塲迎候，旋因該機係飛青島加油，在青稍有停留，到平時間已見延遲，中共方面迎候之人士久候不至，卽先行退去，故代表團飛抵北平之先頭部隊人員若干留守鵠候，代表團一行當經照料下榻六國飯店。至政府和談代表團抵平後，國共雙方之和談序幕是否業已揭開，渠表示因並未過問和談之事，故無法作答。惟從代表團抵達後之種種情形以觀，雙方開始和談，已在積極準備和部署之中。</p>
<p>記者詢以對北平之一般印像，吳氏答稱：以外客數次去平之立塲而言，深覺此行在平之活動，較前次已為寬鬆。自下榻六國飯店後，進出可領取出入證，則出入方面及在外行動，已無任何約束矣。北平市面，頗呈蕭條，惟一般商店仍均開門營業。馬路上人力車已顯著減少，穿西裝者更屬寥寥可數，街頭亦不易見到塗脂抹粉之婦女，一般市民生活，均轉崇樸素，美鈔確甚吃香，市價在袁頭兩倍以上云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中共電臺昨夜廣播新華社社論，以「南京慘案與和平談判」為題，對南京政府施以極猛烈之抨擊。指陳四月一日學生流血案乃發生於南京和平代表團離京後之三小時，此則顯係政府支持「軍警特務」向受國學生行兇之行為，表明南京政府對和平談判之舉行可謂一無誠意。評論中強調政府口中所謂和平係屬虛偽而欺騙者。其目的在保存「反動勢力」，爭取喘息時間。評論中充滿「戰爭罪犯」，「殺人匪徒們」，「這批野獸」，「反動派」，「劊子手」等等刺人心目之字句，此為最近中共漫罵文字中之已不多見者。該社直率指責李宗仁，謂自一月廿一日握政以來之二月中，政府迄未行過一件好事，亦未做過一件確實有利於和平談判之事。在李宗仁·何應欽·白崇禧·張治中等統治下，戰犯毫毛迄未受傷，但和平人民則受打擊與屠殺。該社指出「南京慘案」乃係達到大開屠殺人民頂點之行為，故「希望戰爭罪犯集團放下屠刀，乃是不可能的事情」。又謂李宗仁·何應欽政府以及張治中代表團，對於戰犯究竟採取什麼態度，就是他們有無和平誠意的一塊試金石，並盼其對戰爭罪犯問題，能表明態度</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕關於京市學生與衛戍總部收容總隊歸來官佐發生衝突之不幸事件，政府極為重視。頃已令教育部與衛戍司令部各派大員會同處理。教育部方面特請教育研究委會兼任委員現任立法委員沈少倫氏代表，並請京市各專科以上學校校長組織委員會，協同調查，詳細研究，以期秉公依法處辦。該項委員會已請由金大校長·本市參議會議長陳裕光氏為召集人，卽日着手進行，甚盼各校學生，在此期間，力持鎮靜。至對因傷死亡之中大物理系學生程履繹，教長杭立武極為痛惜，經於今晨親往鼓樓醫院探視，並派督學協助辦理善後事宜。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕三日為星期，京中大·政大·金大·金女大·音樂院·建國·邊校·東方語專·劇專·藥專等十專科以上學校表面尚平靜，僅由各該校學生所組成之「四一血案善後處理委會」散發告全國同胞書，告全國同學書。其致北平國共兩黨和談代表等之文件，其主要內容，皆在說明該案發生真相，請求各方予以營救，予以援助，並反復強調其反迫害爭自由爭生存反對假和平之勇敢與決心。</p>
<h3 id="c6">衛總發言人駁斥　學生書面談話稿 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕首都衛總發言人政工處長羅春波以所謂「南京專科以上學校四一血案善後處理委員會」二日發表之書面談話，內容完全歪曲事實，顛倒是非，顯係少數不肖職業學生，從中操縱，希圖危言聳聽，將事態擴大，以遂行其預定之陰謀，為使社會人士明瞭真相起見，特嚴正駁斥如下：（一）收容總隊官兵，均係在迭次會議中被共軍俘虜後逃回或被共軍訓練數月而放回者，在最近半月內陸續來京，本部奉命臨時收容，待命分發或資遺，此乃社會人士所共知，任何人亦可前往該隊實地調查，而職業學生竟指收容隊員為「武裝特務劊子手」，希圖嫁禍於本部，其別有用心，可以想見。（二）遊行行列自出發至解散，沿途由於本部之週密保護，故未發生任何事端，乃解散後，學生又往收容隊宣傳，始發生衝突，事出偶然，乃社會人士有目共覩，而職業學生竟誣為「有計劃的毒打殘殺」，顛倒是非，令人切齒。（三）本部事先竭盡全力，勸阻遊行，學生不聽，遊行時，本部週密保護，互毆時，本部總司令親往壓制，本處職員因勸阻而輕傷兩人，事後所有受傷及被打者，均一一搶救來部，將傷者送院未傷者派兵乘汽車分別護送回校，此所有被保護分送之學生，當可自行證明。乃職業學生竟謂受傷失蹤同學被「逮捕」，並要求釋放，似此顛倒黑白，以友為敵，真喪盡天良，尤堪痛心。（四）本部截至現止，並未接獲任何學校校長有學生失蹤之報告，三日下午教部杭部長電告，亦謂學生並無失蹤情事，而職業學生竟謂失蹤十九人，顯屬憑空揑造，希圖擴大事態。（五）衝突時，收容總隊隊員所乘卡車，該車現仍停放在中山東路，可供任意參觀。總之，此次事件全係少數職業學生受某方指使，陰謀擾亂治安，阻礙和平而導演，現政府正慎重處理，盼大多數學生，勿再受極少數陰謀者利用，而安心求學，免生事端。</p>

<h3 id="c19">兒童權利社會責任　兒童節獻辭 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>春到人間，萬物欣欣向榮。我們在此時舉行一年一度的兒童節，象徵着兒童們的美麗遠景。真的，兒童之於人類，猶一年四季中的奏。我們這一代的光明面，要他們發揚光大；黑暗面，更要他們連根掘去。</p>
<p>中國兒童跟着多災多刦的國家受苦受難，實在是我們這一代成年人的罪過。今日成千成萬的兒童，陷入奄奄一息萎頓孱弱的境地，許多床畔已無慈母呵眠，許多飯桌已無阿父伴食；他們失去了養，更失去了教。其他兒童應享的權利，更不要說了。</p>
<p>保障兒童的權利，原是社會的責任。考諸周禮，荒政十二，保息有六：「慈幼·養老·賑窮·恤貧·寬疾·安富，」而慈幼事業列入六政之首。孟子說：「幼吾幼，以及人之幼。」足證中國社會向來要負荷兒童的責任。西洋亦有此同樣的情形。年前日內瓦保障兒童宣言，列舉兒童權利之多，社會負責之重，為過去歷史上所少見。可是人類習性，囿於注意今天而忽略明天，也很少留心目前的狀況會影響將來。如果多想些明天的事，社會自可減少自私自利，對於下一代就會發生更進一步的興趣。將來的幸福有時要犧牲現在的快樂；如能注意到將來，則現在的任何犧牲也甘心情願了。</p>
<p>今日大家在談社會政策，不是羡慕蘇聯，就想彷傚英國，自然覺得非如此不時髦。但須知祔政策，對於兒童的責任越來越高；有些責任，可憐，社會尚未完全認識。我們認為亂離時代的中國社會，對於兒童基本權利的起碼責任應該為：（一）生命的保存；（二）健康的增進；（三）遊戲的機會；（四）童工的禁止；（五）教育的實施。這几件事，不是兒童節日叫叫喊喊所能了的，也不是空講社會政策所能實現的，大家必須要切實倡導，埋頭苦幹，才見功效。</p>
<p>（一）生命的保存　兒童向祔第一個要求，就是胎兒嬰兒時期需要適當的養護權利。這是生存權。我們必須使胎兒起，就得保存他的生命一直至獨立成了。他有權利蕏良好機會的生活。把兒童帶領到世界上，是一件嚴肅端莊的事，須要千方百計防止他夭折。宇宙間再沒有更大的悲劇，比殘忍的消滅健強的人類生命還厲害。原始社會不重視人命，打胎·棄嬰·殺嬰等事層出不窮；中國兒童死於非命的仍不少，尤其在戰亂時期，折磨母親，浪擲生產，糟蹋了小生命。小生命或死於砲火，或死於風俗不良，或死於不懂衛生與缺乏醫藥，也有的是葬送於「白髮傷懷，青髮飲泣，妻啼飢，兒號寒」的窮困中。多少嫩脆的幼苗，就有意無意地被成人所桎梏而犧牲了。</p>
<p>（二）健康的增進　我們之所以提倡健康，實在健康是做人做事的基礎，不健康，即無法達到工作的最高效率；不健康，就無從談到生活的美滿豐富。失去了健康，教育和訓練幾完全不能實施。體格和精神常因健康不良而永久傷害。我們要使兒童成長得很強健，五歲以前全恃營養。胎兒時期有養無教，故科學上隻稱胎養而不稱胎教。胎養在易經上已予注意，如孔子講周易序卦說，「物穉不可不養也，故受之以需，　者，飲食之道也」。競爭進入尖銳化的現代，兒童身體必須要能適應新時代的急迫需要。虛弱和殘疾的兒童，社會也該予以好好矯治與訓練，俾減少社會上的無能。</p>
<p>（三）遊戲的機會　所有的動物都高興遊戲，這是兒童的基本本能。幼兒渾身是遊戲，一天到夜，不論是吃·著·睡，都是帶着遊戲性的。遊戲有無窮的利益，對自我發展關係頂大，可促進整個兒童的生理和心理的發展，并具有社會價值。用遊戲培養民生的情緒，在今天更是特別需要；與人合作，使人快樂，在在是遊戲的真正功用。社會對健全的兒童遊戲機會，必須加以大大的擴大。對特殊兒童和問題兒童，更須以遊戲謀他們精神的出路。虛弱兒童，能力不夠，思想不能集中，應鼓勵他多多遊戲。遊戲是從工作中解放到自由，從教室內給以適宜的閑暇。沒有充足的空間或設備，難能完成兒童們社會性的訓練。</p>
<p>（四）童工的禁止　禁止未成熟兒童勞苦工作，也是社會的重要責任。兒童須從賺錢的苦工中拯救出來。雇用兒童從事厰商工作，每使他遭遇無可救藥的結局。健康和發育的危險，獲得職業的妨碍，心理受阻滯，自我發展機會的喪失，刺激犯罪，終至道德墮落。禁雇童工，對下一代充滿着深長意義，變為主要的社會問題了。未到成年時，每個兒童需要家長和社會多方面衛護。社會就權約束厰商禁用童工，讓他們齣水火而登衽席。此後工作，必須適應較高的社會標準。不工作了，要供給教育機會，卻不能讓他們懶惰。懶惰是萬惡之首，懶惰比不工作更懷。</p>
<p>（五）教育的需要　教育是給兒童給系統的發展。政府修「庠序之教」為國儲才，父母要「桃李春風」，子弟成器。文明與野蠻之分，即在教育上判斷。社會愈進步，分工愈精細，愈缺少不了教育。識字是教育的主要部分，不識字陷入無智無識的苦海裏，不但影響自身，且影響整個社會。中國自古獎勵「毀家興學」，這表現出社會負教育之責，現在卻有不少人想毀學興家，連公立的小學和幼稚園都要收費，而且收費有時竟比公立的大學和專科還多，直千古奇聞。兒童所受的教育，尤須於語文的訓練，更注重於職業的訓練和品德的陶冶。否則教育或竟造成高等游民與社會壞蛋！</p>
<p>綜合上述五事，關於保存生命，社會應督促政府切實執行墮胎殺嬰等禁令，承認私生子的地位，并以育嬰堂的精神多辦新式的託兒所。增進健康，主要在實施衛生教育，推行公醫制度。社會上多設遊戲場提倡戶外娛樂，充實學校遊戲設備，以達到個個兒童有遊戲機會。童工和教育，雖屬國家之事，然社會亦應出力出錢，造成舆論，輔助公家的不逮。總之，兒童的福利即社會的匯利，兒童的權利是社會的責任。我們在今歲兒童節，以沉重的心情，呼籲社會人士，把眼光放遠些，多分些溫暖給下一代！</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日電〕美參院二日開始辯論援華問題，共和黨參議員諾蘭，當提出一項對歐洲復員法案之修正案，主張將經濟援華計劃，延長至明年二月十五日，唯不得以任何援助，給予中共區。按現行援華計劃，至二日午夜即告期滿，諾氏修正案旋即遭到參議員康納利與湯瑪斯之反對，康氏等稱總統應有權自行斟酌對外援助之分配，諾蘭堅決反對以工業配備燃料等供給中共區，并稱：「此點法案上應予明白規定」。康納利指責諾氏發言，具有政爭作用，諾氏則斥責美國在中國之政策，已大大危害中國政府，并助長中共之勢焰。渠稱：吾人在歐洲既能採取反共政策，而對中國四萬萬人民所受之赤色威脅，則漠不關心，其故安在，參院辯論不久即散會，并定四日再行討論諾氏之修正案。諾氏修正案與康納利修正案惟一不同處，為禁止予中共區以援助。另眾議院方面各共和黨議員，要求民主黨取消季氏法案中，渠等所反對之規定，雙方已同意於四日再行討論。季氏法案其中允許總統不必顧及去年援華法案之條文，而可自行分配所剩五千四百萬元援款之規定屆時將予取消。經此一番修正後，季氏法案卽可獲得眾院之極大多數支持，共和黨眾議員伏里斯稱：五千四百萬元之援華款項，為數雖少，但在心理上則自具有其價值，因此事可重申吾人鼓勵中國抗拒共黨，維持其獨立之政策也。中國今日正處於窘境，亟須吾人之激勵聲援，故吾人不能允許在吾人之立法中，有將令中國頽喪，或表示願援助有共黨參加之聯合政府之字句存在。</p>

<h3 id="c46">歷史性的北大西洋公約　今日舉行簽字典禮　杜魯門將出席發表演辭　儀式進行情形用各國語言主廣播全世界 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕全世界的目光今日集中在華盛頓，因為十二國的代表在數小時內卽特簽訂歷史性的北大西洋公約。今日雖為星期例假，但國務部內自艾契遜國務卿以次仍照常辦公，以籌備星期一的簽字儀式。世界各國數百名記者現已齊集華盛頓，準備參加明日的盛典。杜魯門總統已完成其特於明日簽訂者得時發表的演辭。觀察家相信，杜魯門屆時將以堅決的語氣，肯定宣布英國傳統的孤立政策今後將成歷史上的陳蹟，同時公約其他十一國的外長，今日亦均忙於整理明日簽字時所特發表的演辭，預料他們將聲明其本國對大西洋公約的全力支援，並將強調公約第五款集體對抗武裝侵略的規定。整個簽字儀式歷時將在一小時左右，各國駐華盛頓的使節均被邀觀禮，但料蘇大使潘友新必不願在塲參觀此一幕。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕國務院今日宣布：大西洋公約簽字式進行情形，將由各大短波無線電臺用四十三國語言廣播至全世界。「美國呼聲」電臺將於四日午後七時四十五分（標準時間）自國務院大禮堂卽簽字所在開始廣播。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕大西洋公約四日在此簽字時，首先簽名者為比利時總理兼外長史巴克，以次為加外長皮爾森，丹外長賴斯慕森·法外長許曼·冰島外長貝奈狄生·義外長史福薩·盧森堡外長貝克·荷外長史蒂克·挪外長蘭傑·葡外長馬泰·英外相貝文·美國務卿艾契遜</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕大西洋諸國外長今日在此開會之第一件行動，卽為鄭重拒絕蘇聯之指責北大西洋公約為破壞聯合國憲章之侵略工具。各外長對蘇聯就大西洋公約所提之抗議照會，提出共同答覆，強調該約之完全僅具防禦性質，僅事針對武裝侵略，決不針對任何一國或數國。彼等又指出蘇聯反抗義書內所列之意見，與蘇聯外交部於一月廿二日所發表之聲明完全相同，可見蘇聯政府就此事之意見，並非自審查該公約之性質及內容而產生，而係基於其他原因。大西洋公約的內容，堪為對付蘇聯此種曲解指責最好的答覆。該約內容極明顯的表示該約僅具完全防禦性質，與聯合國憲章的精神及字義完全吻合。</p>
<h3 id="c47">設置聯防永久機構問題　簽約國作初步研究　三強對西德問題歧見尚待調和 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕十二國外長今日開會時，決將大西洋公約常設委員會待諸該約經原來七發起國政府批準後始行設立，顯示於四月四日之簽字儀式後，各軍事專家將繼續詳細討論公約下各軍事機構之最後形式，此等討論將分別在聯合參謀部及美加聯防所在地之華盛頓及西歐聯盟永久軍委會所在之倫敦舉行。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕大西洋公約十二國外長，將於本週內決定為實施該約所設之永久機構。西歐聯盟所已具有的軍事組織，包括五國國防部長組織之防務委會·永久軍事委會·及其設計及供應機構，將為大西洋公約下所設機構之榜樣。有一重大問題，卽為大西洋公約下的永遠機構究應設在歐洲抑美國，大約不在華盛頓卽在倫敦。諸國外長連日在此舉行之初步討論，集中於審查公約實施時的弱點所在，其主要者如：（一）德國與公約之關係，（二）荷蘭在印尼·法國在越南之軍事現任；（三）英美同被牽涉的希臘內戰；（四）義殖民地問題。關於德國問題，癥結在於如何可使法國及荷比廬恐懼德國再侵略的傳統思想，與當前實際局勢相調和。西方國家尤其是美國，漸認德國如不能迅速復興，則經濟上的紊亂狀態，便於共產勢力的侵入。再就軍事上言，大西洋聯盟茍無政治上及經濟上安定的西德為其屏障，防務不免總有破綻。目前艾契貝文許曼三氏正在研究此事，以便使復興西德不致與法國恐懼德國再侵略的觀念相衝突。關於印尼問題，自荷蘭接受安理會之建議，同意與印尼共和國直接談判後，顯示荷蘭與美國之意見已漸趨接近。在希臘方面，由於共產情報局與南斯拉夫之不睦，及前者之支援希共，南斯拉夫可能停止對希臘遊擊隊之援助，由於該處軍事政治局勢之微妙，自需要英美兩國予以縝密討論。義殖民地雖待聯合國解決，但若大西洋公約諸國不能獲得協定，則此一問題亦無早日解決之望。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕糧食緊急購儲會主任楊綽庵應民調會邀，於昨晚八時在上海電臺播講「都市配糧工作的檢討和展望」。着重分析都市配糧糧源供應情形，並指出目前糧荒之嚴重性質，呼籲各方擴大儲糧，節約消費。</p>
<p>又糧食緊急購儲會主任楊綽庵，頃對記者談，都市配糧糧源情形，謂：根據中美雙方糧食換文，一般協議，都市配糧，由美方負擔百分之四十，我方自籌百分之六十，自籌部份，由該會委託中農·中合庫·蘇農行·中信局·分向國內外產區採購，不足之數，委託糧商採辦。目前國內採購運輸因受戰事影響及各地當局阻難，頗感困難。渠謂自去年七月起至本年三月底止，京滬穗三市共配售食米四十六萬七千餘噸，平·津·青三市共配出麵粉十七萬噸，其中由我方供給的廿五萬餘噸，佔百分之卅九。上海在這期間配出食米三十萬零七千餘噸，其中美方佔十五萬二千餘噸。楊氏謂本期配糧經中美雙方商定，延長至四月底，嗣又承在華美方人員同意，將京滬青穗四市配糧，延至六月底，關於五六兩月份配糧糧源，並經商定中美雙方各佔一半。楊氏宣佈四月份配糧，已妥籌完成。五六兩月糧源，正積極準備中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕米價連日飛漲，一般平民生活極堪憂慮，對於本市米源之供應問題，各界極為關心。經合總署原則上雖已應允本市配米延長至六月底為止，但由於配米主要來源之一緬甸內戰情況之發展，來源恐多少受相當影響。據悉：上月底有一艘運米輪自滬駛抵仰光，卽可載運二萬二千噸來滬，今後是否仍可源源供應尚難逆料。經合總署現除向緬甸暹羅採購外，自美國方面最近亦將有兩三艘商輪運米來華。據該署負責人表示：無論如何，配米決可設法維持至六月底，七月份起如何，則須待華盛頓方面決定。按自一九四八年七月一日起至本年三月底止，經合總署撥資採購分配於我全國各大都市之米糧約達三十九萬噸，價値六千二百五十萬美元。以本市而論，去年七月一日起至本年三月三十一日止，全市共配米約四十萬噸，其中經合總署供給者約二十三萬噸，市府自籌者約十七萬噸，顯示本市米糧消費之半數以上賴該署供給云。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕「兒童節」，這個多麼熟稔的節期，一年復一年，一次又一次，翻看「慶祝」的老花樣，高唱「兒童是社會的棟樑，國家未來主人翁」。如果有人問：中國的主人翁往那裏去找？鐵樣的現實會回答：「道旁的棄嬰，路邊的呌化子，滿街的小偷兒……」先生大人們見之必掩鼻而過，多數還罵一上一聲「小癟三」。這幅熟悉的畫面，對於今天這個熟稔的節目，實在是最尖銳的諷刺！</p>
<p>「兒童節」年年有，但是記者希望今年的兒童節是不平凡的。那些真誠為兒童謀福的人們，他們默默地苦幹了好幾年，為了替難童創造樂園，如今這塊園地，經過辛勤耕耘之後，已略具規模，為了要使其開花結果，不得不求請於大眾的灌溉扶植。記者特為簡括介紹，望大善士救苦救難，勿辜負了這富有意義的今天，慷慨解囊，多為下一代造福！</p>
<p>義賣三毛名畫　悉允福利基金</p>
<p>「三毛樂園運動」，是孫夫人主持下兒童福利工作站所舉辦的，目的在於籌募經費，為難童建造樂園。今日起假大新公司畫廳舉行「三毛生活展覽會」一週，展覽張樂平三毛漫畫原作三百幅。另有特繪水彩三毛畫三十幅，由號稱「多子王」之王曉籟主持，於今日下午二時在塲義賣，所得救濟本市貧苦兒童。展覽會並有其他照片圖表，介紹中國福利基金會上海兒童福利站，兒童劇團，以及故陶行知創辦之育才學校之活動。凡樂願求助三毛贊助該會宗旨之人士，不分國籍，年齡，性別及職業均可加入為會員或三毛之友。會費以三毛為單位，其金額相當於銀圓三枚之金圓券。每月認助五個三毛以上為榮譽會員。每月認助一個三毛以上為普通會員。不定期捐助不定額之物資者為三毛之友。會費可直接送交林森中路九八八號，或電知七〇〇〇六號——七號分機，由該會派人領取。</p>
<p>兩個不同情調　交織新生氣魄</p>
<p>此外記者還願意介紹的，是上海貧兒工讀院今天假座全市各大電臺舉行特別節目，廣播勸募該院經費，擴大收容苦難兒童，為未來祖國作奠基工程。</p>
<p>上海貧兒工讀院在上海人還是個生疏的名詞，因為它是個新興的慈幼機構。雖說它已有一年餘的歷史，而一切設備簡陋得可憐。該院位於江灣新市路，十數年前，它是江灣立達學院的前身，豐子愷的執教處。經過「一二八」和「八一三」砲火的摧殘剩下一片瓦礫塲。一年半來，經過院長丁福保，及副院長王勁父的苦心經營，孤寒樂園——上海貧兒工讀院建立起來了。今天，在這荒涼的廢墟裏，收容了七十五名苦兒，米日是朗朗的讀書聲，米日是杭唷杭唷的勞作聲，不同的情調，交織成一團新生的氣魄。</p>
<p>經費無法維持　眼看即將斷炊</p>
<p>但是為了限於經費，這座樂園是極端可憐的。樂園裏除了數十間草屋外，一無長物。有水，可是沒為電，天黑了，孩子們便只好席地而睡，雖說物質條件如是困苦，但孩子們的精神是愉快的，每天一飯二粥，以新手種植的青菜下飯。個個恪守團體生活的紀律。他們都是生而貧窮的，對生活從不敢存絲毫奢望。但是草屋是經不起風吹雨打的，而且亦易抬致火災，所以當他們發現連最低的生存條件都將被剝奪時，他們感到恐懼了。由於生活程度的突飛猛進，有限的經費無法維持，如得不到各界的援手，眼看卽將斷炊了。</p>
<p>最近，參議員張中原擔任了該院董事長，他立志要為那帬難童請命。改善院內難童生活，固屬急不及待，而如何充分利用現有環境，擴大收容難童名額，亦是有意義的善舉。因為上海貧兒工讀院擁有空地十五畝，限於經濟，現僅收容難童七十五名，如加以充分利用，所能容納的何止數十倍於此數。而況上海一地，應予收容的難童，又何止數百倍於此數。</p>
<p>準備添造樓房　擴充收容難童</p>
<p>一個月前，為了替貧兒工讀院籌募伙食費救急，曾經舉行過一次小規模的廣播，結果成績不壞，米·麵粉·衣着·文具等捐得不少，還有人捐了二十個雞蛋，說明是給孩子們開開葷。此外，有一位老公公，聽了廣播以後，還親自到江灣該院去參觀，然後樂助私蓄二萬元，二萬塊錢並不算個大數目，然而可貴的，在乎那份熱忱助人的感情。</p>
<p>基於人類互助的精神，在張參議員策動之下，決定舉行大規模的勸募，今天，全上海的電臺，包括公營民營，都將為上海貧兒工讀院義務廣播。他們的目標是一億二千萬元，然後替難童造十所樓房，擴充收容，為國儲才。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州二日訊〕長興的煤廠，據地質學專家的研究，是二疊紀龍潭煤系，因其走東西向傾斜度五〇度，故有人誤以為是兩層煤，其實是一層煤。這一煤質硫磺較多，在化學公式上為S+O2=SO2，SO2+HO2=H2SO3就是亞硫酸較多，亞硫酸較多，對於鋼鐵有腐蝕性的，按例工業界對之不會十分歡迎，但因為長興地處水鄉，交通方面，舟楫運輸，成本可以減輕不少，所以在戰前蘇州·無錫等地電廠都樂用長興煤，長興煤於是就有它的自然價值。</p>
<p>長興煤礦區面積，據縣府估計有一千六百五十一公頃，四千五公畝，藏量據煤礦公司估計有一千七百萬裝。遠在一百年前，很多當地人民，以土法開採，後來由劉萬淸接辦，把他加以整理和運用一點新的方法，民國十六年停工，後由中央建設委員會接辦，廿一年由寗益銀團接辦，廿六年中央建設委員會接回，這一時期，為最發達的時期，開採均以機器，礦區由有發電廠，職工有完備的宿舍，有醫療等一切社會上所需要的設備，有輕便鐵道二十七公里從礦區一直通到接卸燃煤的碼頭，那時據縣府估計每月可出煤三萬噸，可是好景不長，後又由商向中央爭回，抗日戰爭爆發，就此停頓，後又開工，到廿九年八月為我破壞，當時專員於樹　趕來，擬將機器搬走，但駐軍不允，遂全部炸毀。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，據地方上人講，還有一部份輕便鐵道遺留在路基上，後來被一些人偷走的偷走，搬去的搬去，現在的煤礦，除了一些殘存破敗不堪的房屋外，餘外一無所存。</p>
<p>資源委員會有意恢復這一煤礦，於是在卅七年十月經行政院通過設立長興煤礦公司，就指定專人負責踏勘，據專家研究結果，如要恢復老井，則因老井為破壞殆盡，先須整理，再事開掘，故費工較多，照八一九時值，原金圓券八百萬元，且須十八個月始到煤層，每天可出四百噸。如另闢新井，則姑且擇定為包村，較老井工程稍便捷，照八一九時值，需金圓券四百萬元。後來資委會擇定後者，並卽撥款，撥運機器，急謀恢復。到是年十二月長興煤礦公司卽在吳興成立辦公處，三十八年一月卽赴長興實地工作。記者為了解這一江南唯一大礦藏的開掘工程，於三月下旬赴長興轉去礦區，我們所經之路，卽前輕便鐵道的基地，路基雖堅實，路面未敷設，故汽車行駛其上，顛簸殊甚，在車中，縣長程萓庭為我述說縣中李家巷為石礦林立之區，石塊年銷蘇滬諸地，為數甚鉅，並有採石燒製石灰，亦頗發達。我們經合溪時遙見一缸窰，專門燒製磁缸。過白峴時見有紙槽及磚瓦工業，深覺長興到是一個小小的手工業區。</p>
<p>行一小時抵達礦區的大煤山，卽是</p>
<p>老井的地點有很多地方上的人民在從前老井開出來的煤榨中淘取煤坩，據說這種煤坩可以銷往宜興等地鐵店中打鐵之用，每人每月也可以賺得一兩担米的辛苦錢，他們已三個年頭賴此為生了。另外許多破落的從前煤礦職工宿舍，已為當地貧苦居民所住，電廠片瓦無存，一個大煙囪還完好的獨立在平地上。老井也尋不到痕跡，只是幾個運煤至小火車的站門，被垃圾與煤榨汚塞着。</p>
<p>我們再前進至包村，正在修築一條啣接去大煤山的公路，大概走上兩公里路，已經到達</p>
<p>新井的所在，新井還沒有開掘，僅挖出一二丈的泥土，在土上釘一木椿，作為新井由是開入處，據一位工程師告訴我：「在離此不遠的地方，已發現了『路頭』——卽礦苗，預備開掘兩井，一號井闊六尺長九尺，是掘煤所用；二號井闊四尺長六尺是通風設備等用，每井均崛入深度一百二十呎，本七十呎卽可見煤，惟恐七十呎之煤已被「吃掉」——卽已掘過，故在七十呎見煤處不加挖掘，繼續折入深度，至一百二十呎始出煤」。現在</p>
<p>他們所期待的就是路的修通與機器的運來，只要路修通，機器運來後就可開始鑿井，鑿井工程的估計，據另一位工程師告訴我每天約可開一呎，則四個月卽可出煤，初出煤時每天約可有一百五十噸。</p>
<p>新的長興煤礦公司職工們，他們現在住在民家，沒有去利用原有的職工宿舍，他們生活是很艱苦的，唯一的希望就是能夠出煤，煤出了，公司也可以維持了。</p>
<p>我曾問幾個在淘煤塊的老百姓，他們對</p>
<p>未來的出煤有着很濃厚的希望，他們希望能早些出煤，讓他們也可賴此生活。所以他們對長興煤礦公司是十分協助的，他們知道協助煤礦公司就是協助自己。在相隔一山的背面，聽說共軍也在挖煤礦，經過好多時間，沒有成功，現已停工了。</p>
<p>從長興的藏量與煤質看長興煤的前途，我們覺得長興煤似乎不適於煉鋼的，當然不能在重工業上謀出路，長興煤只能在附近一帶取得調劑燃料的作用，只能在一些輕工業小工業上謀補助，我們希望它能在扶助農業的工業上起得作用。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕青白對龍頭在甲組足球聯賽第二循環中，該是主力精彩之一戰，因為除鐵路以外，實在找不出可以一拼的隊伍，青白是甲組的領袖，龍頭是北派的代表，雖然第一循環中，龍頭以一比五慘敗，現在青白走了瞿永福費春後衛鐵閘嚴士翕則在休息中，如此兩隊重逢，必定有緊張熱烈的演出。結果，青白究竟還是帬英領袖，龍頭雖全力撞倒，青白在輕描淡寫中，以三比一大勝，上半時青白先勝了兩球。</p>
<p>九十分鐘比賽，龍頭操縱了大部份時間的攻勢，球儘在青白塲地上來往，結果，勝利則是青白的。青白說得上一句攻守咸宜。守是打着第三後衛，孟義良和錢長榮姜訚清並排在門前看守着，黃仁傑坐鎮大門，把龍頭全部攻勢打退了，球儘管在青白門前盤，總是過門不入，及門而止，孟義良究竟老將不慌不忙，從容的把球打回去，雖然胖，還是跑得動。除了錢長榮稍為軟弱外，表演得都滿意。下半時的第四球，青白以勝利在握，連勝了三球，就把伏乃堂和張鳳崗替出金祿生錢長榮，加以孟義良大意遠出，跑回來已經來不及，龍頭奪回了一球，打破了鴨蛋，這是青白的輕敵大意。至於前鋒排着W式的陣圖，羅壽福老是溜在後面，機會一來立刻直竄，給龍頭一個措手不及，龍頭看想　他，結果未成功。劉隆馨的中鋒，竄跑得很快，大有前途。前鋒雖然都是小將，聯絡功夫高人一等，小派司，腳底花樣百出，跑得又快，遠非龍頭北派作風可及。</p>
<p>龍頭的特長，腳頭硬，勁道足，但是聯絡不起來，這是一個大毛病，橫衝直撞，無濟於事。前鋒到了門前，就完了。射門不是太軟太軟，就是橫裏去，好機會失去了許多。龍頭開球先攻，下馬威風，攻勢極度猛烈，姜琨張金根在左翼互相呼應進攻，一球傳中，錢長榮一頂而出。青白反擊，祗見小羅金祿生在左邊急進，亦未見效。五分鐘內，龍頭大軍壓境，來勢洶洶。此時青白後衝送球，願以撒截得猛衝，龍頭猛不防，球已飛至左翼，祗見金祿生如飛而去，直衝抵龍門之前，一腳向中，劉隆緊趕上，一射打開紀錄，龍頭五分鐘內先受打擊，銳氣並不減。連開二次角球，中間提未獲接應。此後龍頭雖猛攻不已，只見高球來去，無補時艱。直至廿五分鐘時，小顧突破空檔，小羅又得球直衝，鄭秉彝見來勢兇猛，上前一鏟，被罰十二碼球，孟義良一蹴而中。龍頭再受當頭一棒，前途益呈黯淡，雖然攻勢未停，了無成就，上半時二對零。</p>
<p>下半時青白原陣不動，龍頭由以新將夏詩銀吳厚成替出王步榮麥爾森。球勢仍在龍頭手中，只見青白門前，大軍飛舞，陳勤夏詩銀二次在左翼機會甚好，未能造就，王寶山遠遠一腳，，亦落黃仕傑之手。時間過去一刻鐘，黃仁義送球，又是一個突破，劉體寅在右翼呼應，球由左而右，劉體寅候個正着，斜射入綱，青白直落三大勝。於是許文奎見勝負大定，調出了錢長榮金祿生，青白乘機大舉，姚慶昇得球直衝，孟義良趕回不及，姜琨夏詩銀並肩而進，黃仕傑見勢危急，衝出救駕，一碰倒地，球由姜琨射在黃仕傑身上彈入，龍頭奪回一球，皆大歡喜。從此青白趕忙收兵，孟義良退守，了此殘局。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨晚滬警逢華聯，觀眾熱烈欣賞，結果華聯以四十六比四十勝滬警六分，上半時廿一比廿三，滬警以二分領前，戰局殊為緊張。</p>
<p>華聯主將李震中未上塲，原屬滬警好機會，上半時滬警防守縝密，史久全亦鋒铓異常，故華聯反落後二分。下半時華聯始見正常狀態，小將樂嘉洲後生可畏，昨松圓表演亦不惡</p>
<p>女子組綠隊勝星會，四四比十六。友誼賽回力勝海青，七十二比十六。三塲戰情如次：</p>
<p>先說壓軸戰華聯對滬警，吸引着三千觀眾，上塲陣線華聯為劉福善，包松圓，吳成章，樂嘉洲，傳金聲五人，滬警以王伯文，王蓉生，史久全，何增，傳其俠迎戰。開賽後，嘉洲伯文各中一球，滬警暫停，樂罰中，久全伯文蓉生的努力，滬警反以十比五超出，華聯瞠目呌停。成章捧入，伯文角球不中，久全復一拍入籃，滬警不可一世，卽包松圓的平日神射亦有不靈之勢。十五分鐘時為十九比十，華聯重商戰略。松圓嘉洲一氣呵成五分，廿一比十五，永標調出其俠，小樂頗為順利，連增二球，上半時滬警廿三，華聯廿一，相差僅一球。</p>
<p>下半時何金貴代永標，福善虛擲，成章投中，嘉洲罰入，華聯廿四比廿三翻身。蓉生老包各顯身手，大家以一分上下，成章又長射，華聯乃以三分領前。卅二比廿八時，滬警好幾次與籃無緣，斯時其俠代金貴，卅七比卅二華聯又暫停。包吳樂三將繼續發展，成四五比卅七。傳其俠五次犯規，金貴代戰，還餘三分鐘時，永標替伯文，滬警尚存「背城借一」希望，俄蓉生步其俠後塵，伯文重作馮婦，然時不我待，華聯終以四十六比四十壓倒滬警</p>

<p>女子組綠隊星華接戰，綠隊「小山東」石宗蘭翻身一球，黃明媛罰中，頓時三分。星華王珊中籃，可是她那胸前的金雞心也同時跳了出來。明媛的一連獲分，造成第一節綠隊贏九比二。第二節星華奮戰得七分，綠隊祗六分，上半時綠隊十五比九佔先。</p>
<p>第三節廿五比十一時，星華守將吳兆瑞犯規「額滿」，因無替補員，乃以汪澤綸調後方坐鎮，前面雖僅剩錢夢月王珊兩人，這一節還能平分秋色，大家六分，（卅一比十五）綠隊似乎在「退化」。四節完畢，四十四比十六，星華不敵。</p>

<p>友誼賽回力對海青，回力上塲者為曾志吉，田福海，魏戍，葉雲山，陳正淼五人。開賽後陳先中，利潑還報一球，司諾繼之，陳再中，乃成各四，主將王永芳「芳蹤」未見，回力不免減色。利潑拉加上一球，回力乃加勁進攻。八比六，徐叔源代志吉，海青換上三人，十四比六，回力白保康羅鼎厚及尚氏兄弟四人進去，海青也在那裏走馬燈似的調換。上半時卅一比七，回力晝發揮。</p>
<p>下半時回力一碰就增加十分，海青得分，依然寥落，結果回力以七十二比十六大勝。海青隊長說：他們祗練習了兩個星期，不能有好的表演，表示歉意。</p>
<h3 id="c97">乒乓須知 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 王心景著　陳霖生校　（五）</p>
<p>（三）習慣與姿勢</p>
<p>記得從前有一個人，他書房裏有一塊低下的地方。他跑到那裏，總覺得很不便當。但經過了相當的時間，也就覺得了。後來他的家人看見他書房裏有這樣的情形，就呌人替他填平了。那知他倒很不自然，因為他已經跑慣了。可見習慣中人之深，成了習慣之後的不易改去。在初習乒乓的人，應該注意養成優良的習慣。</p>
<p>我們常看見有些人拍球時，在每拍一紀球以後，必得把手去摸一下球拍；有的在拍一紀球以後，總得把拍向檯上輕輕的敲一下，也有把不執拍的手向檯上摸一下的；有的在一紀失球之後，一定要長歎一聲，吐一口氣；還有嘴裏常噓噓作聲，也有用力跥足的；……這種情形，寫在紙上，雖不稀奇，但在比賽時，就不免尷尬了。</p>
<p>至於不正確的姿勢，也應該注意的：有人在開球的時候，先把膝屈幾下，然後才慢慢的擺動雙臂；有的把球對着球拍，面部肌肉極度緊張，兩眼頂着對方，在嘴向左一歪之後，才把球猛的打過去；更有的在未開球以前，口中唸唸有詞，喃喃自語一番；……這種姿勢，也不免尷尬的。</p>
<p>習慣的不優良，姿勢的不正確，固然有損美觀，在體力方面很多是不經濟，並且使動作呆滯，所以在初學的時候，應注意姿勢要自然，要養成優良的習慣。</p>
<p>（四）拍乒乓的力與準</p>
<p>拍乒乓是「力」有變化，拍出的球有輕重的分別，遠近的不同。並且拍的球要能「準」，欲高欲低，可左可右，完全可以適合自己理想的目標。這個「力」和「準」的獲得，要從事乒乓運動的人，在方法上，理論上有充分的了解。</p>
<p>拍乒乓的動力，可以分為兩種：一種是原動力，就是肌力：另一種是機動力。機動力的發生從手臂的擺動速率而來的為主，因球的潛力激成的反動力為客。拍時把這「肌力」「機助力」兩種「力」合用，那麼所生的「力」大，分用了發生的「力」就小。</p>
<p>肌力是由於本體在腦的節制之下發生，這是「力」的出於自然的，反動力是球的運動量碰到了阻礙發生的。這種反動力的來源有一定，不能以方法培養的。</p>
<h3 id="c98">評青龍之戰 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>昨日午後三時半，逸園塲上，演出了緊張熱烈之一幕，，由北方之熊（龍頭隊）迎戰東方之虎（青白隊），雙方實力堅強，而在市長盃中俱遭不幸淘汰，昨戰相逢，為挽回令譽起見，均出全力以赴，踢來有聲有色，殺捕非凡。龍頭作風幣剛，大刀闊斧，腳頭爽脆，於中塲控制得利，青白則較柔靭，後離鞏固，前鋒推進迅速，射門有方，合作較好，所以終於迫使龍頭訂城下之盟。平心而論，龍頭踢來雖然爽快悅目，但是前鋒缺乏射門之技巧，球在中塲時，非常活躍，一近對方禁區，就踟蹴不定，坐失良機，後防方面中後衛只知截得來球，高高送出，對於集團及掩護，尚欠功夫，青白棋高一着，自然勝面較大，在第一次循環賽時曾以五比一大破龍頭，但彼時嚴士鑫·瞿永福及費春華均在陣中，現在則士鑫倦動，阿福不知去向，小費投奔華面，三劍客一去，實力大受影響，其間雖有錢長榮·劉隆馨之聯袂來歸，但終屬不得償失，以後如與鐵路對壘，應具戒心，因鐵路新近獲得市長盃，銳氣正盛，而聯賽中祗負與青白一次，緊隨於後，在第二循環賽中，如能一挫青白，則青白之盟主地位，可能發生支動搖，不可不慎之。</p>
<p>昨賽演出，青白防務方面仍以孟義良為核心，中流之砥柱，勞苦功高，三毛之內衛腳頭清楚，掩護得法，可抵八成賬吳祺祥之用塲，錢長榮改任內衛，亦自不凡，薛沛然出將入相，張仁義前後刧奪，劉隆馨之中鋒，常突出於前，形成進攻之槍尖，羅顧二內鋒為進攻之　血管，金祿生之翼予龍頭之威脅甚大，而劉體寅之傳中及開角球，均夠得上翼鋒之條件，小費去後，劉改任翼鋒，亦未始非脫穎而出之道。</p>
<p>全賽龍頭雖然作戰英勇，青白則始終保持優勢，但在下半時調動人馬，立腳未穩，使軍心動搖，又以三毛踢左內衛，牽一髮而動全身，龍頭卒於利用此機會，大肆反攻，扳回一城，由此可知調遣人馬之重要，略一不慎，就易造成錯誤，噬臍莫及，幸虧更動後，時間已很短促，不然倒也很難說。</p>
<p>龍頭鄭秉彝踢法危險，被裁判警告，我總覺得龍頭如此踢法，容易使己使彼，受到傷害，還是謹慎些好。史大法演出不弱，拼命箝制小羅，以關煞青白左面之攻勢，相當成功，新人吳厚成尚好，夏詩銀則尚欠缺經騐，竄頭勢倒很怏，張金根之左翼缺點在一只「死左腳」，有好次機會，假使張能以右足射門，易奏膚功，但是因為他右腳不能派用塲，良機頻失，可惜得很，陳勤有水準上之表演，姜琨亦努力，該隊之作風是大刀闊斧的，但是後防因大刀闊斧而有漏洞，前鋒大刀闊斧而無射門技巧，不善於利用其優點，大刀闊斧反而為害了。（球史公）</p>

<h3 id="c99">誰曾想到兒童 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 黎杰</p>
<p>每到兒童節，必有一套大人們所領導的兒童節的花樣，譬如紀念會呀，音樂會呀，或是什麼書法比賽會呀之類。二十年來，未嘗變過樣子，以爲如此，便是「慶祝」過兒童節了。其實，兒童節決不是要我們「慶祝」的，而是一個機會，叫我們反省：我們能替下一代倣點什麼。紀念會是絕對不需要的，大人先生們扳起面孔來敎訓一頓，叫一大批可憐的小學生餓了肚子來聽你胡扯，這豈是「慶祝」之道？至於音樂會或者什麼比賽之類，雖也是對一部分兒童的一種鼓勵，但這只不過是給天才的或者幸運的兒童們一點點綴，有也可，無也可。所要緊的，我覺得倒是在靜下來想一想，下一代有些什麼問題，是亟需在現在就設法解決的？兒童節不是一個慶祝的日子，這在大人們應該是一個深思的日子。</p>
<p>大家知道的，今日一般兒童最重大的問題有兩個，一是敎育，二是健康。所謂「國民小學」，在今日那裏還是「國民」所進得去的小學？簡直已是非中等以上的人家，不能把子弟送進此門　而所謂中等以上的人家，當然不是指的小公敎人員，因爲公敎八員已經大都是家徒四壁了。這一批人都是奉公守法的，勤儉的知識份子，他們的子弟，由於遺傳，家庭敎育和後天的環境，已承襲了他們這種正直安貧的品性；如果敎育把這一批優秀的下一代摒諸門外，而只替一些貪官汚史好商劣紳的公子小姐們錦上添化，試想：下一代的社會如果由這批人來領導，將變得如何可怕</p>
<p>其次，是健康的問題。這在重要性上，甚至超過敎育。我們試看一般兒童的臉色，倒是面有菜色的多；在情緒上，自然也就是沉默的萎靡的。這是營養和家庭經濟環境使然，除非社會組織有整個的改變，是極難有方法改善的。但就事後的疾病防治來說，我們也絲毫未曾有所盡力。一些名爲公立的大醫院，其門診費的嚇人，使爲父母者望而却步。市立的醫院比較便宜，但醫生之少，就診者之多，常常會呌一個病着的孩子在門外坐等三四個鐘點，聽候呼名。市衛生當局至少應該嚴格取締許多醫院小兒科診費的高昂，並且儘量建立和充賣專爲兒童的醫棄設備，普遍地　施從爲兒童防病到治病的工作。</p>
<p>最可笑的，是中山，中正，復興，外灘等市立公園的收取門票。很小的孩童雖不要門票，但帶他進去的母親却非要門票不可，而且門票是時時在調整的。我不明白，市政府何以窮到如此，竟要在這上面刮一點可憐的錢。公園本是爲兒童的，那末至少應規定帶着小孩的母親不收門票。這固然是小事，但也由此可以看出，我們對於兒童的需要和福利，而是如何的漢視了！</p>

<p>然而，無論國家如何苦難，我們這個民族總不能沒有文化，沒有藝術！繪畫·建築·劇藝等等，也許可以等待天下太平了，再軍振旗鼓，但唯獨音樂這一門，絕對不能久待；因爲音樂的學習，受年齡的限制。世上成功的音樂家，無不在四歲五歲卽開始學習，從沒有在十歲以後才開始攻習而竟能成功的音樂家。而當七歲九歲之幼年，便巳開始作曲及公開演奏的例十，在古今樂人傳記中，乃是極其平凡的事實。</p>
<p>在中國僅有的幾位音樂家中，如現在美國的小提琴聖手馬思宏，鋼琴家黃光光以及巳故的潘美波，其能有成就，除夭才外，便是靠有機會從小學起；相反的，許許多多在高中畢業以後才考）進音專從頭學起的音樂學生們，其結果則是雷同的不幸：時間和精力的浪費。例如洗星海先生（已故）吧，他的天才不能說不高，苦學苦幹的精神，尤其令人欽佩，但是開始得太晚了，終未能如願以償。當他千辛萬苦地到了巴黎，以苦工所得充作學費，在巴黎音樂院苦學小提琴時，已是廿歲左右。豐富的天資，强烈的志趣，對於他，已愛莫能助。</p>
<p>音樂的才能，是先天的，當孩子們受「音樂測騐」時，只要他有一對敏於感受聲音的耳朶，他可以不必事先受過訓練，而能辨識相差極微的音階之高低，他便也有希望在音樂上有所成就，但唯一條件是：得從小學起。</p>
<p>中國是齊備各種天才的國家，但由於種種原因（經濟的及傳統觀念的），我們非但不發掘天才，而且不斷地毀減天才。無數天才孩子，被迫去學習他所並不喜歡學的東西。等到這孩子成人長大，有能力自行攻學音樂時，已是時不我再了。這，對於他個人該是如何殘酷的一件事，對於民族文化，又是如何嚴重的事實！</p>
<p>欣逢兒童節，又逢音樂，敎育協進會舉行兒童音樂比賽，因而寫了這一段平凡的意見，深望遦個比賽能够改變家長們的傳統觀念，不要任意葬送兒女的天才；尤望當道者在處理國家大計的同時，接受我們一句低聲無力的忠言：無論如何，我們這個民族，總不能沒有藝術！</p>

<p>— 余忘我</p>
<h3 id="c102">猪汁針的故事 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 馬丁</p>
<p>——成人的童話</p>
<p>從前，東方有一個國家，呌做吃肉國。那裏的人非常喜歡吃肉，每頓都要吃一點，否則就吞不下飯去。除了吃肉以外，他們又最喜歡打仗。和外國人也打，和自己人也打，打了十幾年，弄得窮透了。他們本來用「紙券」做貨幣，後來改爲用「金券」；到最後，只好改用「金剛鑽券」了，每券據說値一。七三四五八六克拉，——只是不能眞的兌現金剛鑽。雖然如比，物價還是日日飛漲，尤其是大家不能不吃的肉，每斤要値到一萬金剛鑽券了，就是一萬幾千克拉。起先，大家還吃猪肉牛肉，漸漸地，連老鼠肉也賣到五千一斤了。可是又不能不吃。</p>
<p>吃肉國當局無計可施，就去外國請了大批專家來，研究對策。專家們果然來了，一共有兩百多。他們一面吃着老鼠肉，一面仔細調查研究，結果總算想出了辦法</p>
<p>首先，他們研究出，猪肉的所以如此好吃，是由於裏面含着一種「猪汁素」；這種豬汁素可以提鍊出來，注射到別的動物身上，每月一次。一年以後，這種動物外形雖不改變，但其肉的味道，就可和豬肉一般無二了。</p>
<p>其次，專家們發覺，吃肉國裏已沒有什麼動物可供豬汁針的注射了。因爲連年的消耗，狗肉也已被吃光，剩下的只有老鼠。而老鼠太小，注射了猪汁針，秤斤論兩，也賣不起多少錢。</p>
<p>終於，專家們覓得了一個解決的辦法。他們看見吃肉國某大都市普善山莊的報吿，說去冬所收的路屍，以童屍佔百分之九十左右。又據報吿：馬路上夜裏露宿的女丐，差不多都有一二個小孩子，面黃肌瘦，遲早就要死的。魷是好好人家的小孩子，多雖然很多，但也瘦得皮包骨頭，下見得能養得大。</p>
<p>專家們於是向吃肉國政府提出了一個報吿，說：既然你們國度裏小孩子這樣多，而且愈是窮人家，小孩愈多，這些小孩子反正十之八九將來要去給普善山莊埋掉，不會養得活；則何不設怯化無用爲有用，轉消費爲生產，就是：把他們注射猪汁針，等到適當的時候賣給屠宰公司，一方面可解決肉荒，一方面也可使窮人和公敎人員的父母們有點進款，豈不一舉兩得？</p>
<p>吃肉國政府立刻嘉納這個盡善盡美的建議，通令全國施行。並爲疏通肉源起見，特設機構製造了成千成萬的猪汁針，分發給公敎人員，作爲實物配給的一部分，借他們的予女注射。</p>
<p>大家都很歡喜。公敎人員的家裏，子女衆多的，除留下一個作爲傳種接代，繼承香火外，其餘的大都注射了猪汁針。從此，這批注射了豬汁針的小孩，成了家庭的財源，父母也特別歡喜他們，給他們營養的東西吃，好使他們肥一點，重一點，賣更多的錢。</p>
<p>不過，「豬」這個名字總是很難聽的。所以，他們把注射過豬汁針的男孩或女孩算爲「大耳弟弟」，或「大耳妹妹」。我們到人家去，常常可以聽到這樣的對話</p>
<p>「你們有幾個大耳弟弟？頂大的幾斤了？」</p>
<p>「我們只有兩個呀，你們的大耳妹妹看來倒有五十多斤了呀！」</p>
<p>從此以後，吃肉國的孩子們大都注射了豬汁針，甚得政府的保護和父母的疼愛。而肉荒，也自然而然地解除了·爲了紀念外國專家這個富國利民的發明，他們魷把政府發表猪汁針報吿書的氏那個日子定爲「兒童節」，——那魷是四月四日。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Beiping Peace Talks Gradually Unfold; Political Circles in the Capital Eagerly Await Success; Ceasefire Involves Numerous Difficulties in Troop Reorganization <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The peace talks are gradually unfolding in Beiping, and the political situation in the capital is temporarily calm. Apart from expressing particular concern about the tense war situation in Central China, political figures are eagerly anticipating the success of the Beiping peace talks. Although there are daily telegram communications between Nanjing and Beiping, due to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) absolute secrecy regarding news of the negotiations, little is known to the outside world about the actual issues being discussed during the process. However, some people are actively awaiting a ceasefire order from Beiping to realize true peace. But observers believe that the primary task of the current peace talks is the ceasefire issue. A ceasefire necessarily involves troop reorganization, which is related to Mao Zedong's eight conditions. Therefore, a ceasefire is evidently no easy task. According to a certain supervisory committee member, based on the CCP's offensive in the past week, he suspects that the situation of "fighting and talking" may repeat itself. He expressed great pessimism about the future of the peace talks. This view, like the optimistic expectation that a ceasefire order will be issued soon, is full of contradictions. Both situations are ubiquitous among political figures in the capital.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Acting President Li, at 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd, convened a meeting with Ke Yingqin, Yan Xishan, Tong Guanxian, and Bai Chongxi to discuss major peace plans, which lasted until 12:00 p.m.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Our agency has received a wireless telephone report from Beiping, stating that formal peace talks have not yet begun. The representatives of both sides are only exchanging preliminary opinions. It is also learned that Acting President Li had a long-distance telephone conversation with the government's peace talk representatives in Beiping last night. Sources here revealed that the representatives of both sides are making private visits to each other, which are very friendly. Further news: The government will soon establish an advisory committee to make final decisions for the government delegation participating in the peace talks.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Hong Kong Dispatch, 2nd] According to qualified left-wing sources, the Beiping peace negotiations may conclude as early as next week. It is understood that the CCP representatives, regarding the eight conditions proposed by Mao Zedong, may slightly ease only the point of punishing war criminals, but will not concede on the rest. The CCP General Headquarters has utilized the lull in the fighting over the past two months to complete preparations for crossing the Yangtze River, with the initial goal of cutting off the Jing-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) areas. Rumor has it that the CCP has purchased a considerable amount of gasoline in Hong Kong for its armored units. These units, equipped with equipment obtained from the government army, seem to be participating in the CCP's offensive in the Yangtze River basin.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Resumes Flights Between Beiping and Shanghai; No Major Problems in Principle; Wu Fucheng Returns to Shanghai and Speaks to Reporters; The Market in Beiping is Depressed, and People's Lives Have Become Simple and Austere <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The CNAC special plane C64 type XT122, which carried the government peace delegation to Beiping, flew back to Shanghai at 7:10 p.m. last night. The plane arrived in Beiping at 3:10 p.m. on the 1st and was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai the next day, but was delayed by one day due to numerous matters, and did not leave Beiping until 2:30 p.m. yesterday. It arrived in Nanjing at approximately 5:00 p.m., stopped briefly, and arrived at Shanghai Longhua Airport at 7:10 p.m. Accompanying the plane back to Shanghai were only the original two pilots (captain and co-pilot), one telegraph operator, two flight attendants, and Wu Fucheng, the deputy director of the CNAC Shanghai ticket office, who intends to discuss air traffic issues with the CCP. The plane also brought a small amount of mail. After everyone disembarked yesterday, the security personnel at the scene conducted a very strict inspection, even the flight attendants' luggage was not exempt.</p>
<p>According to Wu Fucheng, he went to Beiping on behalf of CNAC to discuss air traffic issues with the CCP side. The initial contact was quite smooth, and there were generally no problems in principle for resuming flights. When reporters asked about specific measures, Wu only said that the future was optimistic and that more specific announcements would have to wait until he had submitted a report to the company authorities.</p>
<p>Wu also said that because the government peace delegation took the plane to Beiping, after receiving the telegram of the departure time from Nanjing, it was estimated that the arrival time in Beiping, so early in the morning, people from all relevant aspects of the CCP were waiting at the airport. However, because the plane flew to Qingdao to refuel, and there was a slight delay in Qingdao, the arrival time in Beiping was delayed. The CCP personnel waiting for the delegation waited for a long time and left first, so some of the advance personnel of the delegation remained on guard. The delegation was taken care of and housed at the Six Nations Hotel. As to whether the prelude to the peace talks between the KMT and the CCP has been opened after the government peace delegation arrived in Beiping, he said that because he did not ask about the peace talks, he could not answer. However, judging from the various situations after the arrival of the delegation, the two sides have actively prepared and deployed for the start of peace talks.</p>
<p>When reporters asked about his general impression of Beiping, Wu replied that, from the perspective of a foreigner who had been to Beiping several times, he felt that his activities in Beiping this time were more relaxed than before. After checking into the Six Nations Hotel, he could obtain an entry and exit permit, so there were no restrictions on entering and exiting and acting outside. The market in Beiping is quite depressed, but general shops are still open for business. The number of rickshaws on the road has decreased significantly, and those wearing Western suits are even rarer. It is also not easy to see women with makeup on the streets. The lives of ordinary citizens have become simple and austere. U.S. dollars are indeed very popular, with a market price more than twice that of Yuan heads.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Captain of the "Tianwang" Plane Participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan for Four Years <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Shot Down a Total of Six Japanese Planes</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Chen Ruitian, the captain of the CNAC "Tianwang" plane, originally from Taishan, Guangdong, is a mixed-race Chinese-American who grew up in the United States. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was the deputy captain of the Third Air Force Group. He participated in the war for four years and shot down six Japanese planes. His last air battle was in 1942, during the Battle of Lunluan Pass, when he was entangled with Japanese planes over Liuzhou. He was surrounded by six Japanese planes and his plane was destroyed. He parachuted, but was shot several times in the air by Japanese planes. After landing, he recovered from his injuries in a small house at the foot of a mountain near the Liuzhou Airport. Once, Japanese planes bombed the airport, and the bomb hit the mountain. The falling rocks destroyed the house. His wife, Wu Yuemei, was killed by the rocks while protecting her husband. After the victory, Chen Ruitian retired from the Air Force and joined CNAC.</p>

<h3 id="e5">The CCP Yesterday Published a Commentary on the Unfortunate April 1st Incident; The Government Has Organized a Committee to Handle It Impartially <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The CCP radio station broadcast a Xinhua News Agency editorial last night, entitled "The Nanjing Massacre and Peace Negotiations," giving the Nanjing government extremely fierce criticism. It pointed out that the April 1st student bloodshed occurred three hours after the Nanjing peace delegation left Nanjing, which clearly showed that the government supported the "military police and special agents" in their attacks on students. It indicated that the Nanjing government had no sincerity whatsoever in holding peace talks. The commentary emphasized that the so-called peace in the government's mouth was false and deceptive, and that its purpose was to preserve "reactionary forces" and buy time. The commentary was full of piercing words such as "war criminals," "murderous bandits," "this batch of beasts," "reactionaries," and "executioners," which have been rarely seen in recent CCP abusive texts. The agency bluntly accused Li Zongren, saying that in the two months since he took office on January 21, the government has not done a single good thing, nor has it done anything that truly benefits peace negotiations. Under the rule of Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and Zhang Zhizhong, war criminals have not been harmed at all, but peaceful people have been attacked and massacred. The agency pointed out that the "Nanjing Massacre" was the culmination of large-scale massacres of the people, so "it is impossible to hope that the war criminal group will lay down their butcher knives." It also said that the attitude of the Li Zongren, He Yingqin government and the Zhang Zhizhong delegation toward war criminals is a touchstone of whether they have sincerity for peace, and hoped that they could express their attitude on the issue of war criminals.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The government attaches great importance to the unfortunate incident of a conflict between students in Nanjing and the returning officers and soldiers of the Garrison Headquarters' Receiving Corps. It has ordered the Ministry of Education and the Garrison Command to each send senior officials to handle the matter jointly. The Ministry of Education has specially invited Shen Shaolun, an educational research committee member and current legislator, to represent the ministry, and has also invited the principals of various colleges and universities in Nanjing to organize a committee to assist in the investigation and study in detail, with a view to handling the matter impartially and in accordance with the law. The committee has invited Jin Da's president and Nanjing City Council Speaker Chen Yuguang to be the convener, and will begin immediately. It is hoped that the students of each school will remain calm during this period. As for the death of Cheng Luyi, a physics student at Zhongda (National Central University), Minister of Education Hang Liwu was extremely grieved, and visited Gulou Hospital this morning and dispatched school inspectors to assist in handling the aftermath.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] As the 3rd was a Sunday, the ten colleges and universities in Nanjing, including Zhongda, Zhengda, Jin Da, Jin Nuda, Conservatory of Music, Jianguo, Bianxiao, Oriental Language College, Drama College, and Pharmacy College, were outwardly calm. Only the "April 1st Bloodshed Aftermath Committee," composed of students from each school, distributed letters to compatriots across the country and letters to students across the country. Its documents to the KMT and CCP peace talk representatives in Beiping mainly explained the truth of the case, requested all parties to provide rescue and assistance, and repeatedly emphasized their courage and determination to oppose persecution, fight for freedom, fight for survival, and oppose false peace.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Garrison Headquarters Spokesperson Refutes the Students' Written Statement <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Luo Chunbo, director of the Political Work Department and spokesperson of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, stated that the so-called written statement issued by the "April 1st Bloodshed Aftermath Committee of Nanjing Colleges and Universities" on the 2nd completely distorted the facts and reversed right and wrong. It was clear that a small number of unscrupulous professional students were manipulating the situation to create alarmism, expand the situation, and carry out their predetermined conspiracy. To clarify the truth for the public, he solemnly refuted it as follows: (1) The officers and soldiers of the Receiving Corps were all those who had been captured by the Communist army in successive battles and escaped or were trained by the Communist army for several months and then released. They arrived in Nanjing successively in the past half month. This headquarters was ordered to temporarily receive them, pending distribution or disposal. This is well known to the public, and anyone can go to the team for on-site investigation. However, professional students referred to the members of the Receiving Corps as "armed special agent executioners," attempting to blame the headquarters, and their ulterior motives can be imagined. (2) From the departure to the dissolution of the march, no incidents occurred along the way due to the meticulous protection of the headquarters. It was after the dissolution that the students went to the Receiving Corps to propagandize, which caused the conflict. The incident was accidental and the public witnessed it. However, professional students falsely accused the event of being a "planned beating and massacre," reversing right and wrong and making people gnash their teeth. (3) The headquarters made every effort in advance to dissuade the march, but the students did not listen. During the march, the headquarters provided meticulous protection. During the mutual attack, the commander-in-chief of the headquarters personally went to suppress it. Two officers of the office were slightly injured while dissuading the students. Afterwards, all the injured and beaten were rescued by the headquarters. The injured were sent to the hospital, and the uninjured were sent back to school by car. All the protected and sent students can prove this themselves. However, professional students stated that the injured and missing students were "arrested" and demanded their release. Such a reversal of black and white, treating friends as enemies, is truly conscience-stricken and regrettable. (4) As of now, the headquarters has not received any reports from school principals that any students are missing. Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education telegraphed on the afternoon of the 3rd that no students were missing. However, professional students claimed that 19 people were missing, which was clearly fabricated out of thin air in an attempt to expand the situation. (5) The truck used by the members of the Receiving Corps during the conflict is still parked on Zhongshan East Road and can be viewed at will. In short, this incident was entirely directed by a small number of professional students who were instructed by a certain party to conspire to disrupt public order and hinder peace. The current government is handling it carefully, and hopes that most students will not be exploited by a very small number of conspirators, but will concentrate on their studies to avoid trouble.</p>

According to the representatives after the consolation, the military officer team members all came from the CCP area. This time, unscrupulous people planned to resist the government.

<p>[Our Report] According to a CCP radio broadcast from Beiping on the 3rd, various democratic parties in China cooperating with the CCP issued a joint statement yesterday opposing the Atlantic Pact, condemning the treaty as threatening human peace. They also pointed out that the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom are currently attempting to extend the Atlantic Pact to the Pacific and called the attention of all parties.

<p>[Agence France-Presse Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Thirty professors from Nanjing University issued a statement this evening opposing a "Pacific Pact" similar to the Atlantic Pact in Asia. They criticized the Atlantic Pact for "deepening the rifts in the Western world and bringing war closer," and accused the pact of being launched by Wall Street to "maintain the benefits it gained in World War II" and of violating the UN Charter. They earnestly requested the leaders of major countries to resolve all disputes within the UN organization. It is generally believed that the signatories represent the liberal elements of Nanjing's intellectual community and are not inclined towards the Communist Party.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Huayuan, 3rd] The Communist Jianghan Column and the 10th Column, which had retreated to the vicinity of Huayuan and Anlu, have suffered heavy casualties, and their offensive has been thwarted. A strong unit of the Nationalist Army's Zhang Corps, after consolidating its positions on both sides of Huayuan, continued to extend its reach toward the area between Anlu and Yunmeng, and between Yingshan and Anlu, on the 3rd at dawn, in order to prevent reinforcements from the two counties of Suixian and Jingshan. There was a small contact at a location 25 li southeast of Anlu at noon. Furthermore, people from all walks of life in Xiaogan brought wine and meat to Huayuan on the 3rd to show their appreciation to the troops, and presented banners to the army commander, Li Benyi, to express their respect. It is also learned that a comfort delegation from Wuhan will soon arrive at the front lines to show their appreciation to the troops.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Huayuan, 3rd] Military News: There was fierce fighting in the suburbs of Xinyang for the entire day on the 2nd. The gunfire only subsided in the evening. Zhu Qiping, the deputy commander of the 5th Pacification Zone, and Pang Mengtao, the chief of staff, led their troops to break through the siege around midnight on the 2nd and reached Guangshui. The 1st Regiment of the 197th Division, which was guarding the Huaihe River Bridge, the Gao Regiment of the 2nd Pacification Brigade stationed at Wulidian, and the five battalions of the 3rd Security Brigade stationed between Zhumadian and Queshan, defeated two Communist regiments and killed or wounded more than 2,000 Communist soldiers in 24 hours of fierce fighting. They also eliminated more than 1,000 local Communists. The 3rd Security Brigade of the Nationalist Army also suffered heavy casualties. Two battalion commanders of the Gao Regiment of the 2nd Pacification Brigade went missing, while another battalion commander led his troops to break through the encirclement after being wounded. Most of the two regiments of the 197th Division broke through the encirclement and retreated to the west of the railway. The Communist forces that besieged Xinyang included four regiments with unknown designations from Guangshan and Luoshan, more than 3,000 troops from the Jianghan Military Region, and two cavalry regiments from the Shahe Military Region coming from Zhengyang and Minggang, as well as more than 2,000 local Communists. About one regiment of Communist soldiers initially entered Xinyang City at midnight on the 1st, but quickly withdrew. On the afternoon of the 2nd, a large force arrived and completely took control. The Nationalist assault troops and the farmers' self-defense forces retreated to the southwestern suburbs to cover the Nationalist army's retreat.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 3rd] It is learned that the 14-arch bridge between Xinyang and Wushengguan has been blown up by the Communist army, causing significant losses.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 3rd] The Battle of Anqing has entered its 12th day. After repeated setbacks, the Communist offensive on the 3rd has slowed down slightly. The Nationalist army is still firmly defending its original positions from Shizishan, Wulidun, and Qipanshan in the suburbs to the Agricultural and Forestry School. Furthermore, the National Army guarding the Tuqiao bridgehead north of Liujiadu in Tongling took the initiative to withdraw on the 3rd. Rumors that the bridge was captured by Chen Yi's 24th Army on the 1st do not correspond to the facts.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The fact that Anqing was able to turn danger into safety this time was largely due to the assistance of the naval fleet. According to Gui Yongqing, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, the Navy has killed or wounded more than 3,000 Communist soldiers in the past ten days or so, while the Navy has only suffered one death and six injuries. Furthermore, the Navy has gathered about seven or eight warships and more than twenty landing craft near Anqing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Rumors that Chen Yi has arrived in Yangzhou to plan military operations to cross the river have not been heard of by military authorities here.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] As the Communist army, after retreating from Xinyang, launched successive southward attacks, the situation in Central China suddenly became tense. Bai Chongxi, who was summoned to Nanjing to discuss peace plans, held lengthy talks with Acting President Li and President He to plan the defense.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 3rd] Bai Chongxi flew back to Hankou from Nanjing at 4:30 PM on the 3rd, accompanied by Song Xilian, a commander of a certain pacification zone, Sun Guoji, the deputy chief of staff of the headquarters, and Yang Shouqiong, the deputy director of the office, and others.</p>
<p>Bai Chongxi's Remarks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 3rd] After returning to Hankou from Nanjing, Bai Chongxi made the following remarks to reporters at 7:00 PM that evening: I came to Nanjing a few days ago on official business to report on my duties. I happened to meet the government's peace delegation heading north. Today, the realization of overall peace is not only the unanimous desire of the people and the government, but also the common hope of peace-loving countries around the world. Therefore, since the government advocated peace, it has made preparations in good faith to seek peace. In military terms, the National Army has ceased military actions since January of this year and is awaiting orders in its original defense areas. What we regret most is that the Communist army's military actions have not ceased. The Communist army is advancing south on multiple routes. Even the troops of Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen, far away in North China, are launching a major southward advance, gradually pressing towards the north bank of the Yangtze River. In the Anhui region, more than 30,000 troops are attacking Anqing, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. In the Central China region, the Communist army is successively attacking Queshan, Xinyang, Kaishengguan, and Huayuan from Zhumadian. Our army is successively moving south from Zhumadian. Although the CCP has invited the government's peace delegation to Beiping and started negotiations on April 1st, its military actions have not stopped at all. Recalling the failure of past political consultations, which were caused by negotiations and fighting at the same time, leading to no results and continuous warfare until today, if we repeat the same mistake, the prospects for peace will inevitably disappoint both Chinese and foreign people. We earnestly hope that both sides will respect public opinion, take the preservation of the nation's vitality and the people's livelihood as the top priority, meet each other with sincerity, and immediately cease military actions in order to conduct sincere negotiations and achieve true peace as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Children's Rights and Social Responsibility - A Message for Children's Day <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Spring has arrived, and all things are flourishing. We are holding the annual Children's Day at this time, symbolizing the beautiful future of children. Indeed, children are to humanity as spring is to the four seasons. We want them to carry forward the bright side of our generation and eradicate the dark side from its roots.</p>
<p>Chinese children are suffering along with the disaster-ridden and calamity-laden country. It is truly the fault of our generation of adults. Today, tens of thousands of children are in a state of near death, exhaustion, and weakness. Many bedsides are without the soothing words of a loving mother, and many dining tables are without the company of a father. They have lost nourishment and even more so, education. Not to mention the other rights that children should enjoy.</p>
<p>Guaranteeing children's rights is originally a social responsibility. Considering the Zhou Li, among the twelve policies for famine relief, there are six for ensuring rest: "Cherishing the young, providing for the elderly, providing for the poor, comforting the impoverished, alleviating illness, and securing the wealthy," and the cause of cherishing the young is listed first among the six policies. Mencius said: "Love my young ones, and extend that love to the young ones of others." This is sufficient evidence that Chinese society has always shouldered the responsibility for children. The West also has this same situation. The Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child years ago listed the many rights of children and the heavy responsibilities of society, which were rarely seen in past history. However, human habits are limited to paying attention to today and neglecting tomorrow, and rarely paying attention to how the current situation will affect the future. If we think more about tomorrow, society can reduce selfishness and develop a greater interest in the next generation. The happiness of the future sometimes requires sacrificing the joy of the present. If we can pay attention to the future, then any sacrifice in the present will be willingly made.</p>
<p>Today, everyone is talking about social policy, either admiring the Soviet Union or wanting to imitate Britain, and naturally feels that anything else is out of fashion. However, it must be known that social policy places an increasingly higher responsibility on children; some of these responsibilities, unfortunately, society has not fully recognized. We believe that Chinese society in an era of turmoil should have the following minimum responsibilities for the basic rights of children: (1) preservation of life; (2) promotion of health; (3) opportunities for play; (4) prohibition of child labor; (5) implementation of education. These few things cannot be accomplished by shouting slogans on Children's Day, nor can they be realized by simply talking about social policy. Everyone must earnestly advocate and work hard to see results.</p>
<p>(1) Preservation of Life The first requirement of children to society is the right to proper care during the fetal and infant stages. This is the right to survival. We must preserve the life of the fetus from the beginning until it becomes independent. He has the right to good opportunities in life. Bringing a child into the world is a solemn and dignified matter, and we must do everything possible to prevent his premature death. There is no greater tragedy in the universe than the cruel destruction of a healthy human life. Primitive societies did not value human life, and abortion, abandonment of infants, and infanticide occurred frequently. Many Chinese children still die unnatural deaths, especially during times of war, which torment mothers, waste production, and ruin young lives. Young lives die from artillery fire, bad customs, ignorance of hygiene and lack of medicine, and some are buried in poverty where "white-haired parents grieve, black-haired children weep, wives cry from hunger, and children wail from cold." Many tender seedlings are intentionally or unintentionally fettered and sacrificed by adults.</p>
<p>(2) Promotion of Health The reason we promote health is that health is the foundation for being a person and doing things. Without health, it is impossible to achieve the highest efficiency of work; without health, it is impossible to talk about a fulfilling and rich life. Without health, education and training are almost impossible to implement. Physical and mental health are often permanently damaged due to poor health. We want to make children grow up strong, relying entirely on nutrition before the age of five. During the fetal period, there is only nourishment and no education, so science only calls it fetal nourishment and not fetal education. Fetal nourishment has already been paid attention to in the I Ching. For example, Confucius said in his preface to the Zhou Yi: "Things cannot be un-nourished when they are young, therefore they are received with need, which is the way of eating and drinking." In modern times, when competition is intensifying, children's bodies must be able to adapt to the urgent needs of the new era. Society should also provide good correction and training for weak and disabled children to reduce the number of incompetent people in society.</p>
<p>(3) Opportunities for Play All animals enjoy playing. This is the basic instinct of children. Infants are full of play. From morning to night, whether they are eating, dressing, or sleeping, they are all playing. Play has infinite benefits and is very important for self-development. It can promote the physiological and psychological development of the whole child and has social value. Cultivating people's emotions through play is especially needed today. Cooperation with others and making people happy are the true functions of play. Society must greatly expand the opportunities for healthy children to play. For special children and problem children, we must use play to find a way out for their spirits. Weak children have insufficient ability and cannot concentrate their thoughts, so they should be encouraged to play more. Play is liberation from work to freedom, and gives appropriate leisure time from the classroom. Without sufficient space or equipment, it is difficult to complete children's social training.</p>
<p>(4) Prohibition of Child Labor Prohibiting immature children from hard work is also an important responsibility of society. Children must be rescued from the hard work of earning money. Employing children in factory work often leads to irreparable consequences. Dangers to health and development, obstruction of career opportunities, psychological stagnation, loss of self-development opportunities, stimulation of crime, and ultimately moral degradation. Prohibiting child labor is full of profound meaning for the next generation and has become a major social problem. Before reaching adulthood, every child needs the protection of parents and society in many ways. Society should have the power to restrain factories from using child labor and allow them to escape from fire and water and ascend to comfort. After that, work must adapt to higher social standards. After they stop working, they should be provided with educational opportunities, but they cannot be allowed to be lazy. Laziness is the root of all evil, and laziness is worse than not working.</p>
<p>(5) The Need for Education Education is to give children systematic development. The government establishes "schools and academies" to store talents for the country, and parents want "peach and plum breezes" and their children to be successful. The difference between civilization and barbarism lies in the judgment of education. The more advanced society is, the more refined the division of labor is, and the more indispensable education is. Literacy is the main part of education. Illiteracy leads to a sea of ​​ignorance and ignorance, which not only affects oneself but also affects the entire society. China has always encouraged "destroying families to build schools," which shows that society bears the responsibility for education. Now, there are many people who want to destroy schools to build families, and even public elementary schools and kindergartens have to charge fees, and sometimes the fees are even higher than public universities and colleges, which is truly a strange thing throughout the ages. The education that children receive must especially focus on language training, and even more on vocational training and moral cultivation. Otherwise, education may even create high-level idlers and social bad guys!</p>
<p>To summarize the above five points, regarding the preservation of life, society should urge the government to strictly enforce prohibitions on abortion and infanticide, recognize the status of illegitimate children, and set up new-style nurseries in the spirit of orphanages. To promote health, the main focus should be on implementing health education and promoting a public medical system. Society should set up more playgrounds, promote outdoor entertainment, and enrich school play equipment to ensure that every child has the opportunity to play. Although child labor and education are matters of the state, society should also contribute money and effort to create public opinion and assist the government's shortcomings. In short, the welfare of children is the welfare of society, and the rights of children are the responsibility of society. On this year's Children's Day, we appeal to people from all walks of life with a heavy heart to look further ahead and give more warmth to the next generation!</p>

<h3 id="e33">US Senate Debates Aid to China Issue, No Agreement Reached on Either Side, Knowland Opposes Aiding Communist-Controlled Areas <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The US Senate began debating the issue of aid to China on the 2nd. Republican Senator Knowland proposed an amendment to the European Recovery Act, advocating that the economic aid to China program be extended until February 15 of next year, but that no aid be given to Communist-controlled areas. The current aid to China program is scheduled to expire at midnight on the 2nd. Knowland's amendment was immediately opposed by Senators Connally and Thomas. Connally and others said that the President should have the right to decide on the distribution of foreign aid. Knowland firmly opposed supplying Communist-controlled areas with industrial equipment, fuel, etc., and said, "This point should be clearly stipulated in the bill." Connally accused Knowland's speech of having political implications, while Knowland accused the US policy in China of greatly harming the Chinese government and fueling the CCP's momentum. He said: "Since we can adopt an anti-communist policy in Europe, why are we indifferent to the red threat to China's 400 million people?" The Senate adjourned soon after the debate and scheduled to discuss Knowland's amendment again on the 4th. The only difference between Knowland's amendment and Connally's amendment is that the former prohibits aid to Communist-controlled areas. On the House side, Republican members demanded that the Democrats cancel the provisions in the Kee bill that they opposed. Both sides have agreed to discuss it again on the 4th. The provision in the Kee bill that allows the President to allocate the remaining $54 million in aid funds without regard to the provisions of last year's Aid to China Act will be cancelled at that time. After this revision, the Kee bill can receive the overwhelming majority of support in the House. Republican Congressman Voorhis said: "Although the $54 million in aid to China is small in amount, it has its value psychologically. This can reaffirm our policy of encouraging China to resist the Communists and maintain its independence. China is in a difficult situation today and urgently needs our encouragement and support. Therefore, we cannot allow in our legislation any words that will discourage China or indicate a willingness to aid a coalition government with Communist participation."</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, March 3] On the morning of the 3rd, more than ten military personnel from a certain unit attempted to exchange "Sichuan silver dollars" and various types of foreign silver coins for gold jewelry at local jewelers such as Shihua Jewelry, based on the Shanghai Central Bank's published regulations that silver dollars should be accepted regardless of their version. However, the jewelers refused to accept them due to the significant price difference between "Sichuan silver dollars" and "Big Head" silver dollars, claiming they were unaware of the current exchange rates. This led to repeated disputes, and by the afternoon, the jewelers had essentially ceased operations. The County Chamber of Commerce has requested the Provincial Government and the Zhenjiang branch of the Central Bank to study exchange methods so that businesses can potentially resume operations on the 4th.</p>

<h3 id="e46">The Historic North Atlantic Treaty; Signing Ceremony to Be Held Today; Truman to Attend and Deliver a Speech; Ceremony Proceedings to Be Broadcast Worldwide in Various Languages <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, March 3] All eyes worldwide are focused on Washington today as representatives from twelve nations are set to sign the historic North Atlantic Treaty within hours. Although today is a public holiday, the State Department, from Secretary of State Acheson downwards, is operating as usual, preparing for Monday's signing ceremony. Hundreds of journalists from around the world have gathered in Washington to attend tomorrow's grand event. President Truman has completed the speech he will deliver at the signing. Observers believe that Truman will affirm in a firm tone that Britain's traditional policy of isolation will henceforth be a thing of the past. The foreign ministers of the other eleven nations of the treaty are also busy preparing speeches for tomorrow's signing, and are expected to declare their nation's full support for the Atlantic Treaty and to emphasize Article 5, which provides for collective resistance to armed aggression. The entire signing ceremony is expected to last about an hour. Ambassadors to Washington from various nations have been invited to observe the ceremony, but it is expected that Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin will not wish to attend.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, March 3] The State Department announced today that the proceedings of the Atlantic Treaty signing ceremony will be broadcast to the world in 43 languages by major shortwave radio stations. "The Voice of America" will begin broadcasting from the State Department Auditorium, where the signing is taking place, at 7:45 p.m. (standard time) on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, March 3] When the Atlantic Treaty is signed here on the 4th, the first signatory will be Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak, followed by Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen, French Foreign Minister Schuman, Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson, Italian Foreign Minister Sforza, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Bech, Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, Portuguese Foreign Minister Mateus, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and U.S. Secretary of State Acheson.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, March 2] The first action taken by the foreign ministers of the Atlantic nations at their meeting here today was to formally reject Soviet accusations that the North Atlantic Treaty is an aggressive tool that violates the UN Charter. The foreign ministers issued a joint response to the Soviet Union's protest note on the Atlantic Treaty, emphasizing that the treaty is purely defensive in nature, aimed solely at armed aggression, and not directed against any one nation or group of nations. They also pointed out that the opinions listed by the Soviet Union in its protest were identical to those expressed by the Soviet Foreign Ministry on January 22. This shows that the Soviet government's views on this matter did not arise from examining the nature and content of the treaty, but were based on other reasons. The content of the Atlantic Treaty provides the best answer to this kind of distorted accusation by the Soviet Union. The content of the treaty clearly indicates that the treaty is purely defensive in nature and is fully in line with the spirit and wording of the UN Charter.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Member Nations Conduct Preliminary Study on Establishing Permanent Joint Defense Organization; Differences Between the "Big Three" on the West German Issue Remain to Be Resolved <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, March 3] The twelve foreign ministers, at their meeting today, have decided that the permanent committee of the Atlantic Treaty should be established only after the treaty has been ratified by the original seven signatory governments. This indicates that after the signing ceremony on April 4, military experts will continue detailed discussions on the final form of the military organizations under the treaty. These discussions will take place separately in Washington, at the location of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board, and in London, at the location of the permanent military committee of the Western European Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, March 3] The twelve foreign ministers of the Atlantic Treaty are expected to decide this week on the permanent organizations to be established to implement the treaty. The existing military organizations of the Western European Union, including the Defense Committee composed of the five defense ministers, the permanent military committee, and its design and supply organizations, will serve as models for the organizations to be established under the Atlantic Treaty. A major issue is whether the permanent organizations under the Atlantic Treaty should be located in Europe or the United States, most likely either in Washington or London. The preliminary discussions held by the foreign ministers here in recent days have focused on examining the weaknesses in the implementation of the treaty, the main ones being: (1) Germany's relationship with the treaty; (2) The military involvement of the Netherlands in Indonesia and France in Vietnam; (3) The Greek civil war, which involves both the UK and the US; (4) The issue of Italian colonies. Regarding the German issue, the crux is how to reconcile the traditional fear of German re-aggression held by France, Belgium, and Luxembourg with the current practical situation. Western nations, especially the United States, are increasingly recognizing that if Germany cannot be quickly revitalized, economic turmoil will make it easier for communist forces to infiltrate. Furthermore, from a military point of view, the Atlantic Alliance cannot avoid having weaknesses in its defense if it does not have a politically and economically stable West Germany as its bulwark. Currently, Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman are studying this matter in order to ensure that the revitalization of West Germany does not conflict with France's fear of German re-aggression. Regarding the Indonesian issue, since the Netherlands accepted the Security Council's suggestion and agreed to negotiate directly with the Republic of Indonesia, it shows that the opinions of the Netherlands and the United States are gradually converging. In Greece, due to the discord between the Cominform and Yugoslavia, and the former's support for the Greek communists, Yugoslavia may cease its aid to the Greek guerrillas. Due to the delicate military and political situation there, it requires careful discussion by both the UK and the US. Although the Italian colonies are awaiting resolution by the United Nations, if the nations of the Atlantic Treaty cannot reach an agreement, then there is no hope for an early resolution of this issue.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, March 3] The 81st U.S. Congress, which opened on January 3 of this year, has now been in session for a full three months, but the most important bills have not been decided, and some have not even been discussed.

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, March 3] According to reliable sources on the 3rd, Republican Senator Brewster overturned a compromise amendment to the European Recovery Program during the Senate meeting on the evening of the 2nd. The amendment concerned the Netherlands and its war in Indonesia. The amendment, proposed by Vandenberg, a Republican foreign policy spokesman, and endorsed by the State Department, advocated suspending the Netherlands' share of the recovery fund only if the UN Security Council ordered sanctions against the Netherlands because of the situation in Indonesia. However, Brewster opposed it and strongly urged the Senate to pass his amendment, which advocated suspending the Netherlands' four hundred million dollars recovery fund. Vandenberg publicly declared that he opposed putting immediate pressure on the Netherlands because such action would place the United States in a position of taking unilateral sanctions outside the UN framework.</p>

<p>Da Feng Department Store at 72 Tongxing Road in Wusong was originally a decades-old family business with a good reputation. The owner, Huang Defeng, was recently plagued by usurious loans, resulting in significant losses and making it impossible to maintain the business. Consequently, on the 19th of last month, he issued dozens of bad checks to various parties, obtained funds, and then fled without a trace the following day. He also sent letters to the district chief of the area, Wu Renqi, and the chairman of the chamber of commerce, Gao Zhongyi, requesting that they handle the liquidation on his behalf. Subsequently, creditors such as Wang Yashan, Wang Xinghua, and He Yabai registered their claims. The results showed that over 100 million yuan had been defrauded in total. This figure does not include Shanghai Datung Bank and other parties. It is reported that the creditors, together with the liquidator, inspected the assets of Da Feng yesterday and estimated their value at only over 10 million yuan. Therefore, the debts could not be distributed proportionally, and efforts are still being made to pursue the individual responsible.</p>

Knowing that the situation was dire, Yang ran upstairs, hid in the attic, and quickly closed the door, while shouting "Robbers!" inside. This angered the robbers, and one of them fired a shot through the door, hitting Yang's right wrist. At that time, neighbors on both sides heard the gunshot and also began shouting. The robbers, startled by this, fled empty-handed. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the police station in charge and had the injured person taken to Nanyang Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] On the morning of the 1st of this month, an unidentified male corpse was discovered beside a small river in Jiangjiaqiao, Pudong. The police station in charge dispatched officers to investigate and pursue the murderer. Unexpectedly, Fan Lewu, a staff member of the judicial section of the Songshan Police Station, received a report some days ago that the deceased had been killed by Mei Bingqi, the owner of the Xiangtai fried goods shop at No. 18 Jiangjiaqiao. He obtained approval from his superiors to investigate. By that time, the shop owner and staff had already left. Later, evidence from a female servant, He Xiaomei, revealed that she heard someone calling for help in the shop that night, but when she went downstairs to investigate, she was stopped by the shop staff. Finally, the police found a rope hanging from the beam in the kitchen of the shop. They returned to Shanghai and reported the incident and immediately investigated Mei's whereabouts. The day before yesterday, they learned that Mei was hiding at 473 Fuxing East Road. They went there at 6:00 AM yesterday, and Mei had not yet gotten up. Upon hearing that the police had arrived, he attempted to escape through the window, but was still apprehended. After being taken to the station for questioning, he flatly denied any involvement, but claimed that the deceased was a thief who had been apprehended and beaten by his shop staff that night. He was accidentally killed, and afterwards the corpse was placed in a sack and dumped beside a nearby stream. The next day, the two shop staff fled to Chongming out of fear of punishment. Based on the confession, the police station detained Mei and dispatched officers to Chongming to pursue the fugitives.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Yang Chuo'an Broadcasts, Calls for Expanding Grain Storage; Grain Rationing for May and June to be Half from the U.S. and Half from Domestic Sources <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Emergency Grain Procurement and Storage Committee, was invited by the Public Opinion Survey Committee to broadcast a speech entitled "Review and Prospects of Urban Grain Rationing Work" on Shanghai Radio Station at 8:00 PM last night. He focused on analyzing the supply situation of urban grain rationing sources, pointed out the serious nature of the current grain shortage, and called on all parties to expand grain storage and conserve consumption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Emergency Grain Procurement and Storage Committee, recently told reporters about the grain sources for urban rationing, saying that according to the general agreement of the Sino-U.S. grain exchange letters, 40% of the urban rationing should be borne by the U.S. and 60% should be raised domestically. The domestic part is entrusted by the committee to the China Farmers, China Cooperative Bank, Jiangsu Agricultural Bank, and China Trust Bureau to purchase from domestic and foreign producing areas. The insufficient amount is entrusted to grain merchants to purchase. At present, domestic procurement and transportation are quite difficult due to the impact of the war and the obstruction of local authorities. He said that from July of last year to the end of March of this year, a total of 467,000 tons of rice had been rationed in the three cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and 170,000 tons of flour had been distributed in the three cities of Pingjin and Qingdao, of which more than 250,000 tons were supplied by our side, accounting for 39%. Shanghai distributed more than 300,700 tons of rice during this period, of which more than 152,000 tons were from the United States. Yang said that the rationing for this period was extended to the end of April after consultations between China and the United States. Later, with the consent of the U.S. personnel in China, the rationing of grain in the four cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Guangzhou was extended to the end of June. It was also agreed that the grain sources for the May and June rationing would be split equally between China and the United States. Yang announced that the rationing for April had been properly completed. The grain sources for May and June are being actively prepared.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Myanmar War Affects Rice Supply <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Rice prices have soared in recent days, and the lives of ordinary people are extremely worrying. All sectors are extremely concerned about the supply of rice sources in the city. Although the Economic Cooperation Administration has in principle agreed to extend the city's rice ration to the end of June, the development of the civil war in Myanmar, one of the main sources of rice, may have a significant impact on the source. It is reported that at the end of last month, a rice-carrying ship sailed from Shanghai to Yangon, which could carry 22,000 tons to Shanghai. It is difficult to predict whether it can still be supplied continuously in the future. In addition to purchasing from Myanmar and Siam, the Economic Cooperation Administration will also have two or three commercial ships transporting rice from the United States to China recently. According to the person in charge of the administration, the rice ration can be maintained until the end of June no matter what, and what will happen starting in July will depend on the decision in Washington. According to statistics, from July 1, 1948 to the end of March of this year, the Economic Cooperation Administration allocated funds to purchase and distribute approximately 390,000 tons of rice and grain worth US$62.5 million to major cities across the country. In the case of this city, from July 1, 1948 to March 31 of this year, a total of approximately 400,000 tons of rice were rationed in the city, of which approximately 230,000 tons were supplied by the Economic Cooperation Administration and approximately 170,000 tons were raised by the municipal government, indicating that more than half of the city's rice consumption depends on the administration's supply.</p>

<p>[Our Special Feature] "Children's Day," such a familiar holiday, year after year, time after time, we see the same old ways of "celebrating" and sing the same old songs about "children being the pillars of society and the future masters of the country." If someone asks: Where can we find the masters of China? Ironclad reality will answer: "Abandoned babies by the roadside, beggars on the street, little thieves everywhere..." Gentlemen will inevitably cover their noses and pass by, most even cursing, "Little bastards!" This familiar picture is the most poignant satire of this familiar holiday today!</p>
<p>"Children's Day" comes every year, but the reporter hopes that this year's Children's Day will be extraordinary. Those who sincerely seek the well-being of children have been working hard silently for several years to create a paradise for orphans. Now this piece of land, after hard work, has taken shape. In order to make it blossom and bear fruit, they have to ask the public to irrigate and support it. The reporter will briefly introduce this, hoping that the benevolent people will relieve suffering and difficulties, not waste this meaningful day, and contribute generously to create a better future for the next generation!</p>
<p>Selling Sanmao's Famous Paintings for Child Welfare Funds</p>
<p>The "Sanmao Paradise Movement" is organized by the Children's Welfare Work Station under the chairmanship of Madame Sun, with the aim of raising funds to build a paradise for needy children. Starting today, the "Sanmao Life Exhibition" will be held at the Da Sun Company's gallery for a week, exhibiting 300 original Sanmao cartoons by Zhang Leping.

Monthly contributions of five or more Sanmao units qualify for honorary membership. Monthly contributions of one or more Sanmao units qualify for ordinary membership. Those who make irregular donations of materials of unspecified amounts are friends of Sanmao. Membership fees can be sent directly to 988 Linsen Middle Road, or call 70006, extension 7, and the organization will send someone to collect them.</p>
<p>Two Different Sentiments Intertwined with New Vitality</p>
<p>In addition, the reporter would also like to introduce the Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute, which will hold a special program at major radio stations throughout the city today to broadcast fundraising for the institute's expenses, expand the accommodation of destitute children, and lay the foundation for the future motherland.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute is still an unfamiliar term to Shanghai residents because it is a newly established child welfare organization. Although it has been around for more than a year, all the equipment is pitifully simple. The institute is located on Jiangwan New City Road. More than ten years ago, it was the predecessor of Jiangwan Lida College, where Feng Zikai taught. After the devastation of the "January 28th" and "August 13th" artillery fires, only a rubble field remained. Over the past year and a half, through the painstaking management of President Ding Fubao and Vice President Wang Jingfu, the desolate paradise—the Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute—has been established. Today, in this desolate ruin, 75 destitute children are accommodated. Every day there is the sound of reading aloud, every day there is the sound of "Hang yo, hang yo" of labor. Different sentiments intertwine to form a group of new vitality.</p>
<p>Funds Cannot be Maintained; Running Out of Rice</p>
<p>However, due to limited funding, this paradise is extremely pitiful. In addition to dozens of thatched cottages, there is nothing of value in the paradise. There is water, but no electricity. When it gets dark, the children have to sleep on the ground. Although the material conditions are so difficult, the children's spirits are happy. They eat one meal and two congees a day, with freshly grown vegetables. Everyone strictly abides by the discipline of group life. They were all born poor and never dared to have any extravagant expectations for life. But the thatched cottages cannot withstand wind and rain, and they are also prone to fires. So when they discover that even the lowest conditions for survival will be taken away, they are afraid. Due to the rapid increase in the cost of living, the limited funds cannot be maintained. If they do not receive assistance from all sectors, they will soon run out of rice.</p>
<p>Recently, Senator Zhang Zhongyuan took over as chairman of the institute's board of directors. He is determined to speak out for those orphans. Improving the lives of the orphans in the institute is an urgent task, and how to make full use of the existing environment to expand the number of orphans accommodated is also a meaningful good deed. Because the Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute has 15 mu of open space, and only accommodates 75 orphans due to economic constraints. If it is fully utilized, it can accommodate many times more than this number. Moreover, there are countless more orphans in Shanghai who should be accommodated.</p>
<p>Preparing to Add Buildings to Expand Accommodation of Destitute Children</p>
<p>A month ago, a small-scale broadcast was held to raise emergency funds for the Poor Children's Work-Study Institute, and the results were not bad. A lot of rice, flour, clothing, and stationery were donated. Someone even donated 20 eggs, explaining that it was for the children to have a treat. In addition, an old man listened to the broadcast and personally went to the institute in Jiangwan to visit, and then happily donated 20,000 yuan of his private savings. 20,000 yuan is not a large sum, but what is valuable is his enthusiasm and willingness to help others.</p>
<p>Based on the spirit of human mutual assistance, under the instigation of Senator Zhang, it was decided to hold a large-scale fundraising event. Today, all the radio stations in Shanghai, including public and private ones, will voluntarily broadcast for the Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute. Their goal is 120 million yuan, and then build ten buildings for the orphans, expand accommodation, and cultivate talent for the country.</p>
<p>Oh, blessed people! When you are living in a warm atmosphere, relieving boredom with the radio, may you move your compassionate heart and save those hungry children!</p>
<h3 id="e80">Literacy Classes Benefit Poor Children; Little Teachers Volunteer to Teach <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In order to help poor children who are out of school have the opportunity to read, the three Children's Welfare Centers of the China Welfare Fund, under the direction of the Sun News Agency, established literacy classes a long time ago. The poor children who signed up were extremely enthusiastic. The three centers were open from morning to night and still not enough to accommodate them. The eight or nine teachers were too busy to cope, so they adopted and implemented the "Little Teacher" system advocated by Tao Xingzhi, asking the children to teach what they had learned to their parents and neighbors. This not only solved the problem of teachers, but also cultivated the spirit of self-reliance and mutual assistance in these children. To date, the trial implementation of this Little Teacher system has fully proven to be a success. The Welfare Fund's literacy classes have expanded to 100 classes. Due to the large number of classes, the Welfare Center was unable to arrange for them all. Except for 30 classes that are held in the centers, the remaining 70 classes are held in the kitchens, attics, rooms, courtyards, or open spaces that the Little Teachers can find in their own homes. These are called Family Literacy Classes. The center provides each class with a small blackboard and a specially compiled "General Reader for Old and Young" textbook. Ten or twenty poor children surround a broken table, and the Little Teacher teaches the class. Those who don't have a table use door panels from shops as a substitute. Those who have classes outdoors bring broken stools from home to sit on and listen to the lectures. These 70 Family Literacy Classes are now distributed in the slums and shantytowns of Pudong and Puxi. The children being taught include those who set up stalls and do small business, pick up garbage, and push carts at the bridgehead. The First Children's Welfare Center on Suzhou Road has a more special class that is entirely composed of street beggars, a total of fifteen or sixteen people, who also have classes every day.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] During the police investigation of the headless dismemberment case on Jinji Road, it happened that Shui Yao Chen, a former colleague in the Shanghai banking industry, disappeared in Hangzhou and was once suspected of being the dismembered corpse. Wang Sizu, deputy director of the Changshu Police Station, personally went to Hangzhou to conduct an on-the-spot investigation, and reopened the coffin in Shanghai for re-examination, which has proven that the dismembered corpse is definitely not Shui Yao Chen. Recently, Shui's family learned that Shui is still alive. It is reported that Shui, in Shanghai, lost money in business and was disheartened. He used the pretext of going to Hangzhou to mourn his teacher Sun Yici's death, abandoned his family and left home. He went from Hangzhou to a large temple in Fenghua to shave his head and become a monk. After Shui's younger sister Shui Xiuqiang and her eldest daughter learned of this, they went to Hangzhou this morning and then to Ningbo to visit, intending to persuade him to return to secular life in Shanghai and reunite with his family. The above news was confirmed by the Changshu branch, so the current investigation target of the case has been narrowed down to the last person. After other agencies discovered this missing person, judging from various references, it is likely that he is the dismembered corpse. One of the suspects in the case has been under surveillance for several days, and it has been found that this person's whereabouts are extremely secretive and he has plans to leave Shanghai. Active efforts are being made to collect relevant evidence, and action will be taken in the short term. The unveiling of this mysterious headless case is not far off.</p>

<h3 id="e88">A Glimpse of the Changxing Coal Mine Area <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou, this newspaper, 2nd] According to the research of geological experts, the coal in Changxing coal mine belongs to the Longtan coal series of the Permian period. Because its dip runs east-west at an angle of 50 degrees, some people mistakenly believe that there are two layers of coal, but in fact, there is only one layer. This coal has a high sulfur content, which in chemical formula is S+O2=SO2, SO2+HO2=H2SO3, meaning there is a high content of sulfurous acid. A high content of sulfurous acid is corrosive to steel, so in principle, the industry does not welcome it very much. However, because Changxing is located in a water town, transportation by boat can reduce costs considerably. Therefore, before the war, power plants in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places were happy to use Changxing coal, so Changxing coal has its natural value.</p>
<p>According to the county government's estimates, the Changxing coal mine area covers 1,651 hectares, or 4,005 acres, with reserves estimated by the coal mine company at 17 million tons. As far back as 100 years ago, many local people used primitive methods to mine it. Later, Liu Wanqing took over, and he reorganized it and used some new methods. Work stopped in 1927. Then, the Central Construction Commission took over, followed by the Ningyi Banking Group in 1932. In 1937, the Central Construction Commission took it back. This period was the most developed period. Mining was done by machine, and the mining area had its own power plant. Employees had complete dormitories and all the social facilities needed, such as medical care. A 27-kilometer light railway ran from the mining area all the way to the wharf where the coal was unloaded. At that time, the county government estimated that 30,000 tons of coal could be produced per month. However, the good times did not last long. Later, merchants fought with the central government to get it back. The War of Resistance against Japan broke out, and work stopped. Work resumed later, but in August of 1940, we destroyed it. At that time, Commissioner Yu Shu rushed to the scene and planned to move the machinery away, but the garrison refused, so it was all blown up.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, according to local people, some of the light railway remained on the roadbed. Later, some people stole it, and others moved it away. Now, the coal mine has nothing left except for some dilapidated and crumbling houses.</p>
<p>The Resources Committee intends to restore this coal mine, so in October 1948, the Executive Yuan approved the establishment of the Changxing Coal Mine Company and appointed someone to be responsible for surveying the site. According to the research results of experts, if the old wells are to be restored, then because the old wells are almost completely destroyed, they must be reorganized first and then excavated, so it will take more work. According to the value of the gold yuan in August 1948, it will cost 8 million yuan, and it will take 18 months to reach the coal seam, and 400 tons can be produced per day. If a new well is opened, then Baocun can be tentatively selected, which is slightly more convenient than the old well project. According to the value of the gold yuan in August 1948, it will cost 4 million yuan. Later, the Resources Committee selected the latter, and immediately allocated funds and transported machinery to urgently seek restoration. In December of that year, the Changxing Coal Mine Company established an office in Wuxing, and in January 1949, it went to Changxing to work on the ground. In order to understand the excavation project of this only large mine in Jiangnan, the reporter went to Changxing and then to the mining area in late March. The road we traveled was the base of the former light railway. Although the roadbed was solid, the road surface was not paved, so the car was very bumpy. In the car, County Chief Cheng Yiting told me that the Lijiaxiang area in the county is an area with numerous stone mines. The stone blocks are sold to Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places every year in large quantities, and the quarrying and lime burning are also quite developed. When we passed Hexi, we saw a jar kiln in the distance, which specializes in burning porcelain jars. When we passed Baixian, we saw paper troughs and brick and tile industries. I deeply felt that Changxing is a small handicraft area.</p>
<p>After an hour's drive, we arrived at Dameishan in the mining area, which is</p>
<p>the location of the old well. Many local people are picking coal slag from the coal pits dug out of the old well. It is said that this kind of coal slag can be sold to iron shops in Yixing and other places for ironworking. Each person can also earn one or two dan of rice per month for their hard work. They have been living on this for three years. In addition, many dilapidated former coal mine worker dormitories are inhabited by poor local residents. Not a single tile remains of the power plant. A large chimney still stands perfectly intact on the flat ground. The old well cannot be found either. Only a few station doors for transporting coal to small trains are blocked by garbage and coal slag.</p>
<p>We then moved forward to Baocun, where a road is being built to connect to Dameishan. After walking about two kilometers, we arrived at</p>
<p>the location of the new well. The new well has not yet been excavated, and only one or two zhang of mud have been dug out. A wooden post is nailed to the soil, marking the place where the new well will be opened. According to an engineer, "Not far from here, the 'lutou' - that is, the ore vein - has been discovered. Two wells are planned to be dug. Well No. 1 is six feet wide and nine feet long and is used for digging coal; Well No. 2 is four feet wide and six feet long and is used for ventilation and other equipment. Each well is dug to a depth of 120 feet. Coal can be seen at 70 feet, but we are afraid that the coal at 70 feet has been 'eaten' - that is, has been dug. Therefore, we do not excavate at the coal seam at 70 feet, but continue to dig deeper, until the coal comes out at 120 feet." Now</p>
<p>what they are looking forward to is the construction of the road and the transportation of the machinery. As long as the road is built and the machinery is transported, they can start drilling the wells. According to another engineer, the estimated progress of the well-drilling project is about one foot per day, so coal can be produced in four months. When the coal is first produced, about 150 tons can be produced per day.</p>
<p>The employees of the new Changxing Coal Mine Company are now living in private homes and have not used the original employee dormitories. Their lives are very difficult. Their only hope is to be able to produce coal. Once the coal is produced, the company can also survive.</p>
<p>I asked a few old people who were picking coal scraps, and they had</p>
<p>a strong hope for the future coal production. They hope that the coal will be produced as soon as possible so that they can also rely on it for a living. Therefore, they are very supportive of the Changxing Coal Mine Company. They know that helping the coal mine company is helping themselves. On the back of the mountain across from them, I heard that the communists are also digging coal mines. After a lot of time, they have not been successful and have now stopped work.</p>
<p>Judging from Changxing's reserves and coal quality, we feel that Changxing coal does not seem suitable for steelmaking. Of course, it cannot seek a way out in heavy industry. Changxing coal can only play a role in regulating fuel in the surrounding area, and can only seek subsidies in some light and small industries. We hope that it can play a role in industries that support agriculture.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Powerful Longtou Still No Match for Qingbai <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The match between Qingbai and Longtou in the second round of the Group A Football League should be one of the most exciting matches because, apart from the Railway team, there is really no other team that can compete. Qingbai is the leader of Group A, and Longtou is the representative of the Northern School. Although Longtou suffered a crushing defeat of 1-5 in the first round, Qingbai now lacks Qu Yongfu and Fei Chun, and defender Yan Shixi is resting. With these circumstances, the reunion of the two teams will definitely be a tense and exciting performance. As a result, Qingbai is still the leader of the heroes. Although Longtou tried its best to knock them down, Qingbai won easily by a score of 3-1. In the first half, Qingbai scored two goals first.</p>
<p>In the 90-minute match, Longtou controlled most of the offensive time, and the ball went back and forth on Qingbai's field. As a result, Qingbai won. Qingbai can be said to be good at both offense and defense. The defense was playing with a third defender. Meng Yiliang, Qian Changrong, and Jiang Yunqing stood side by side in front of the goal, watching. Huang Renjie was in charge of the goal, repelling all of Longtou's attacks. Although the ball was circling in front of Qingbai's goal, it always stopped at the door. Meng Yiliang was still calm as an old general, calmly hitting the ball back. Although he was fat, he could still run. Except for Qian Changrong's slightly weak performance, the performance was satisfactory. In the fourth quarter of the second half, Qingbai was sure of victory and won three straight goals. Fu Naitang and Zhang Fenggang were replaced by Jin Lusheng and Qian Changrong, and Meng Yiliang was careless and went out far, and it was too late to run back. Longtou regained a goal, breaking the duck egg, which was Qingbai's complacency and carelessness. As for the forwards lined up in a W formation, Luo Shoufu always slipped behind. As soon as the opportunity came, he immediately rushed straight, catching Longtou off guard. Longtou tried to watch him, but it was not successful. Liu Longxin's center forward ran very fast and has a great future. Although the forwards are all young players, their coordination skills are superior, with many short passes and tricks under their feet, and they run fast, which is far beyond the reach of Longtou's Northern School style.</p>
<p>Longtou's strengths are hard feet and strong strength, but they cannot connect, which is a major problem. Charging straight ahead is useless. When the forwards arrive in front of the goal, they are finished. The shots are either too soft or go sideways, and many good opportunities are lost. Longtou kicked off and attacked first, with great momentum. The offensive was extremely fierce. Jiang Kun and Zhang Jingen echoed each other on the left wing to attack. A pass in the middle was not received. Qingbai counterattacked. Only Xiao Luo Jin Lusheng was seen rushing forward on the left, but it was also ineffective. Within five minutes, Longtou's army pressed the border, and the momentum was extremely fierce. At this time, Qingbai rushed to send the ball. Yuan Yisa intercepted and rushed fiercely. Longtou was caught off guard, and the ball flew to the left wing. Only Jin Lusheng was seen flying away, rushing straight to the front of the dragon gate, kicking towards the middle, Liu Long caught up tightly, and a shot opened the record. Longtou suffered a blow within five minutes, and its vigor did not decrease. Two corner kicks were taken in a row, but no one responded in the middle. After that, although Longtou attacked fiercely, only high balls went back and forth, which did not help. Until the 25th minute, Xiao Gu broke through the gap, and Xiao Luo got the ball and rushed straight again. Seeing the fierce attack, Zheng Bingyi stepped forward and shoveled it, and was fined a penalty kick. Meng Yiliang scored a goal. Longtou suffered another blow, and the future became more bleak. Although the offensive did not stop, it was of no avail. The first half was two to zero.</p>
<p>In the second half, Qingbai did not move its original lineup, and Longtou replaced Wang Burong and Melson with new players Xia Shiyin and Wu Houcheng. The ball was still in Longtou's hands. Only Qingbai's door was seen, and a large army was flying. Chen Qin and Xia Shiyin had two very good opportunities on the left wing, but they failed to create them. Wang Baoshan took a shot from afar, and it also fell into the hands of Huang Shijie. An hour later, Huang Renyi sent the ball, another breakthrough. Liu Tiyin echoed on the right wing. The ball went from left to right. Liu Tiyin waited for it, and a diagonal shot went into the net. Qingbai won three straight. So Xu Wenkui saw that the victory or defeat was determined, and transferred Qian Changrong and Jin Lusheng. Qingbai took the opportunity to launch a large-scale attack. Yao Qingsheng got the ball and rushed straight. Meng Yiliang could not catch up. Jiang Kun and Xia Shiyin advanced side by side. Seeing the critical situation, Huang Shijie rushed out to save the day and fell to the ground when he collided. The ball was shot by Jiang Kun and bounced into Huang Shijie's body, and Longtou regained a goal, and everyone was happy. From then on, Qingbai hurried to collect the troops, and Meng Yiliang retreated to defend, ending the game.</p>

<p>[This newspaper] The basketball league match between Shanghai Police and Hualian last night was eagerly watched by the audience. As a result, Hualian defeated Shanghai Police by a score of 46 to 40, winning by six points. In the first half, Shanghai Police led by two points with a score of 21 to 23. The battle situation was very tense.</p>
<p>Hualian's main player, Li Zhenzhong, did not appear on the field, which was originally a good opportunity for the Shanghai Police. In the first half, the Shanghai Police had a tight defense, and Shi Jiuquan was also exceptionally sharp, so Hualian fell behind by two points. In the second half, Hualian began to show its normal state. The young player Le Jiazhou is admirable, and yesterday's performance of Song Yuanyuan was also not bad.</p>
<p>In the women's team, the Green Team defeated Xinghua, 44 to 16. In the friendly match, Huili defeated Haiqing, 72 to 16. The battle situation of the three matches is as follows:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the final battle between Hualian and Shanghai Police, which attracted 3,000 spectators. The starting lineups for Hualian were Liu Fushan, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, Le Jiazhou, and Chuan Jinsheng, and the Shanghai Police countered with Wang Bowen, Wang Rongsheng, Shi Jiuquan, He Zeng, and Chuan Qixia. After the start of the game, Jiazhou and Bowen each scored a goal, and the Shanghai Police called a timeout. Le scored on a penalty kick. With the efforts of Jiuquan, Bowen, and Rongsheng, the Shanghai Police exceeded by 10 to 5. Hualian stared in shock and called a timeout. Chengzhang brought the ball in, and Bowen's corner kick was unsuccessful. Jiuquan then shot the ball into the basket again. The Shanghai Police was invincible. Bao Songyuan's usual sharpshooting also showed signs of failing. At 15 minutes, the score was 19 to 10. Hualian remarried the strategy. Songyuan and Jiazhou scored five points in one go, 21 to 15. Yongbiao transferred Qixia, and Xiaole was quite smooth, adding two more goals in a row. In the first half, the Shanghai Police led with 23, and Hualian had 21, with a difference of only one goal.</p>
<p>In the second half, He Jingui replaced Yongbiao. Fushan wasted a shot, Chengzhang scored, and Jiazhou scored on a penalty kick. Hualian turned over with a score of 24 to 23. Rongsheng and Lao Bao each showed their skills, and everyone fought with a one-point difference. Chengzhang shot from a long distance again, and Hualian led by three points. At 32 to 28, the Shanghai Police missed the basket several times. At this time, Qixia replaced Jingui, and Hualian temporarily stopped with 37 to 32. Bao, Wu, and Le continued to develop, reaching 45 to 37. Chuan Qixia committed five fouls, and Jingui played instead. With three minutes remaining, Yongbiao replaced Bowen. The Shanghai Police still had the hope of "fighting to the death." Er Rongsheng followed in Qixia's footsteps. Bowen became a Feng Fu again, but time was running out. Hualian finally defeated Shanghai Police by a score of 46 to 40.</p>

<p>The women's team Green Team played against Xinghua. The Green Team's "Little Shandong" Shi Zonglan turned over and scored a goal, and Huang Mingyuan scored on a penalty kick, reaching three points at once. Xinghua's Wang Shan scored a basket, but the golden chicken heart on her chest jumped out at the same time. Mingyuan's continuous scoring resulted in the Green Team winning 9 to 2 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Xinghua fought hard and scored seven points, while the Green Team only scored six points. In the first half, the Green Team led with 15 to 9.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, at 25 to 11, Xinghua's guard Wu Zhaorui committed five fouls and was "full." Because there were no substitutes, Wang Zhelun was transferred to the rear to take charge. Although there were only Qian Mengyue and Wang Shan left in front, this quarter was still able to tie the score, with everyone getting six points (31 to 15). The Green Team seemed to be "regressing."

<p>In the friendly match between Huili and Haiqing, the players who appeared on the field for Huili were Zeng Zhiji, Tian Fuhai, Wei Yu, Ye Yunshan, and Chen Zhengmiao. After the start of the game, Chen scored first, and Li Bo returned a goal. Sinuo continued, and Chen scored again, making the score 4 each. The main player Wang Yongfang's "fragrant trail" was not seen, and Huili was inevitably dimmed. Li Bo added another goal, and Huili intensified its attack. At 8 to 6, Xu Shuyuan replaced Zhiji, and Haiqing replaced three players. At 14 to 6, Huili Bai Baokang, Luo Dinghou, and the Shang brothers went in. Haiqing was also changing like a revolving lantern. In the first half, the score was 31 to 7, and Huili exerted its strength.</p>
<p>In the second half, Huili increased by ten points as soon as it touched the ball. Haiqing's score was still sparse. As a result, Huili won a big victory with a score of 72 to 16. The captain of the Haiqing team said: They had only practiced for two weeks and could not have a good performance, and expressed their apologies.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Things to Know About Table Tennis <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Wang Xin Jing, Edited by Chen Lin Sheng (5)</p>
<p>(3) Habits and Posture</p>
<p>I remember a person who had a low spot in his study. He always felt inconvenienced when he went there. But after some time, he got used to it. Later, his family saw the situation in his study and had someone fill it in. But he felt very unnatural because he was used to the low spot. This shows how deeply rooted habits are in people and how difficult they are to change once they have formed. Beginners in table tennis should pay attention to developing good habits.</p>
<p>We often see some people, when hitting the ball, touching the racket after each hit; some lightly tap the racket on the table after each hit; some touch the table with the hand that is not holding the racket; some sigh loudly and exhale after missing a shot; some constantly hiss, and some stomp their feet forcefully... These situations, when written on paper, may not seem strange, but they are inevitably awkward during a match.</p>
<p>As for incorrect posture, one should also pay attention: some people, when serving, first bend their knees several times before slowly swinging their arms; some focus intensely on the ball with their facial muscles extremely tense, staring at the opponent, and then, after their mouth twitches to the left, they smash the ball; even some mutter words to themselves before serving... Such postures are also inevitably awkward.</p>
<p>Unfavorable habits and incorrect postures not only detract from aesthetics but are also often uneconomical in terms of physical strength and make movements stiff. Therefore, when learning, one should pay attention to natural posture and develop good habits.</p>
<p>(4) Power and Accuracy in Playing Table Tennis</p>
<p>Playing table tennis involves variations in "power," with differences in the lightness and heaviness of the shots, and differences in distance. Furthermore, the shots must be "accurate," able to go high or low, left or right, perfectly suited to one's ideal target. To achieve this "power" and "accuracy," those involved in table tennis should have a thorough understanding of the methods and theories.</p>
<p>The power behind playing table tennis can be divided into two types: one is the original power, which is muscle strength; the other is kinetic energy. Kinetic energy mainly comes from the swinging speed of the arm, with the reactive force generated by the ball's potential energy as a secondary factor. When these two types of "power," "muscle strength" and "kinetic energy," are used together when hitting, the resulting "power" is greater; when used separately, the resulting "power" is smaller.</p>
<p>Muscle strength is generated under the control of the brain, which is the "power" that comes naturally. Reactive force is generated when the momentum of the ball encounters resistance. The source of this reactive force is fixed and cannot be cultivated through methods.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Commentary on the Blue Dragon Battle <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at half past three, a tense and exciting scene unfolded at Yiyuan Stadium. The Northern Bear (Longtou Team) faced the Eastern Tiger (Qingbai Team). Both sides possessed strong capabilities and were unfortunately eliminated in the Mayor's Cup. Meeting in yesterday's battle, they both gave their all to regain their reputation, resulting in a lively and impressive match. Longtou's style was firm and bold, with vigorous strokes and agile footwork, effectively controlling the midfield. Qingbai, on the other hand, was more resilient, with a solid defense and rapid forward advances, skillful shooting, and better cooperation, ultimately forcing Longtou to surrender. Objectively speaking, although Longtou's play was refreshing and pleasing to the eye, their forwards lacked shooting skills. While they were very active in the midfield, they hesitated and missed opportunities when approaching the opponent's penalty area. In the defense, the center-backs only knew how to intercept the ball and send it high, lacking teamwork and cover. Qingbai's superior strategy naturally led to a greater chance of victory. In the first round-robin, they had defeated Longtou 5-1, but at that time, Yan Shixin, Qu Yongfu, and Fei Chunhua were all on the team. Now, Shixin is weary, Afu is missing, and Xiaofei has joined Huamian. With the departure of the Three Musketeers, their strength has been greatly affected. Although Qian Changrong and Liu Longxin have returned to the team, it is ultimately not enough to compensate for the loss. They should be wary when facing the Railway team in the future, as the Railway team recently won the Mayor's Cup and is full of momentum. In the league, they have only lost once to Qingbai, closely following behind. If they can defeat Qingbai in the second round-robin, Qingbai's leading position may be shaken, so they must be cautious.</p>
<p>In yesterday's match, Qingbai's defense was still centered around Meng Yiliang, a pillar of strength who worked tirelessly. Sanmao's inside backs had clear footwork and effective cover, compensating for eighty percent of Wu Qixiang's performance. Qian Changrong, reassigned to the inside back position, was also remarkable. Xue Peiran switched between forward and back, Zhang Renyi intercepted the ball aggressively both in front and behind, and Liu Longxin's center forward often pushed forward, forming the spearhead of the attack. Luo and Gu, the two inside forwards, served as the blood vessels of the attack, and Jin Lusheng's wing greatly threatened Longtou. Liu Tiyin's crosses and corner kicks were worthy of a winger. After Xiaofei left, Liu was reassigned to the wing, which may be a way for him to stand out.</p>
<p>Although Longtou fought bravely throughout the match, Qingbai maintained the advantage. However, in the second half, the personnel changes destabilized their footing and shook their morale. Furthermore, Sanmao playing the left inside back position caused a chain reaction, allowing Longtou to seize this opportunity to launch a major counterattack and score a goal. This shows the importance of personnel deployment. A slight carelessness can easily lead to mistakes that are difficult to remedy. Fortunately, the changes were made late in the game, otherwise, the outcome would have been difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Longtou's Zheng Bingyi played dangerously and was warned by the referee. I always feel that Longtou's style of play can easily cause harm to both themselves and others, so it is better to be cautious. Shi Dafa's performance was not weak, desperately containing Xiao Luo and effectively shutting down Qingbai's left-wing attack, which was quite successful. The newcomer Wu Houcheng was okay, but Xia Shiyin still lacked experience. His ability to break through was very fast, but Zhang Jingen's left wing had a weakness: a "dead left foot." He had several opportunities, and if Zhang could have shot with his right foot, it would have been easier to achieve results. However, because his right foot was unusable, he missed many good opportunities, which was a pity. Chen Qin had a performance above standard, and Jiang Kun also worked hard. The team's style is bold and unrestrained, but the defense has loopholes due to this boldness, and the forwards lack shooting skills, failing to capitalize on their strengths. The boldness, in fact, became detrimental. (By the Ball History Public)</p>

<h3 id="e99">Who Has Thought About Children? <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jie</p>
<p>Every Children's Day, there is always a set of Children's Day routines led by adults, such as commemorative meetings, concerts, or calligraphy competitions. For twenty years, it has never changed, as if this is how Children's Day is "celebrated." In fact, Children's Day is definitely not for us to "celebrate," but an opportunity for us to reflect: what can we do for the next generation? Commemorative meetings are absolutely unnecessary. Adults put on solemn faces to lecture, making a large group of pitiful elementary school students listen to your nonsense on an empty stomach. Is this the way to "celebrate"? As for concerts or competitions, although they are also a kind of encouragement for some children, they are just a little embellishment for talented or lucky children, which can be there or not. The important thing, I think, is to sit down and think about what problems the next generation has that need to be solved now. Children's Day is not a day for celebration, but a day for deep thought for adults.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the most important problems facing children today are two: education and health. The so-called "national primary school," is it still a primary school that "national" can attend today? It has simply become a school that only families above the middle class can afford to send their children to. And the so-called families above the middle class, of course, do not refer to the petty civil servants, because civil servants are already mostly impoverished. These people are law-abiding and thrifty intellectuals. Their children have inherited their upright and frugal character due to heredity, family education, and the environment. If education excludes this group of excellent next generation and only adds icing on the cake for the sons and daughters of corrupt officials and bad gentry, imagine how terrible the next generation's society will become if led by these people.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of health. This is even more important than education. If we look at the complexions of most children, they are mostly sallow; in terms of mood, they are naturally silent and listless. This is due to nutrition and family economic environment, and it is extremely difficult to improve unless there is a complete change in the social organization. But in terms of disease prevention and treatment afterward, we have not done anything at all. Some large hospitals named public hospitals have such intimidating consultation fees that parents are deterred. Municipal hospitals are cheaper, but the small number of doctors and the large number of patients often make a sick child sit outside for three or four hours waiting to be called. The municipal health authorities should at least strictly prohibit the high pediatric consultation fees of many hospitals and establish and equip medical facilities specifically for children as much as possible, universally implementing work from disease prevention to treatment for children.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is the collection of admission tickets at municipal parks such as Zhongshan, Zhongzheng, Fuxing, and the Bund. Although very young children do not need tickets, the mothers who take them in must have tickets, and the tickets are constantly being adjusted. I don't understand why the municipal government is so poor that it has to scrape a little pitiful money from this. Parks are for children, so at least it should be stipulated that mothers with children are not charged admission tickets. This is certainly a small matter, but it also shows how seriously we take the needs and welfare of children!</p>
<h3 id="e100">Children's Music <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— You Ting</p>
<p>In times of war, art is most easily overlooked; when parents' income is not even enough to feed themselves, "children's music" is most easily dismissed.</p>
<p>However, no matter how difficult the country is, our nation cannot be without culture and art! Painting, architecture, drama, etc., may be able to wait until the world is peaceful before making a comeback, but only music cannot wait for a long time; because the learning of music is limited by age. Successful musicians in the world all started learning at the age of four or five. There has never been a musician who started studying after the age of ten and was able to succeed. And the examples of children who started composing and performing publicly at the age of seven or nine are extremely common facts in the biographies of ancient and modern musicians.</p>
<p>Among the few musicians in China, such as the violin virtuoso Ma Si-hong in the United States, the pianist Huang Guangguang, and the late Pan Meibo, their achievements are due to the opportunity to learn from a young age, in addition to talent; on the contrary, many music students who only entered music schools after graduating from high school and started from scratch have the same unfortunate result: a waste of time and energy. Take Mr. Xian Xinghai (deceased), for example. His talent cannot be said to be low, and his spirit of hard work and dedication is especially admirable, but he started too late and ultimately failed to achieve his wish. When he arrived in Paris with great difficulty, using the money he earned from hard work as tuition, he was already about twenty years old when he began studying the violin at the Paris Conservatory. Abundant talent and strong interest could not help him.</p>
<p>Musical talent is innate. When children take "music tests," as long as they have ears that are sensitive to sound, they can recognize the subtle differences in pitch without prior training, and they have the potential to achieve something in music, but the only condition is that they must start learning from a young age.</p>
<p>China is a country with all kinds of geniuses, but due to various reasons (economic and traditional concepts), we not only do not discover geniuses, but also constantly destroy them. Countless talented children are forced to learn things they do not like to learn. By the time the child grows up and has the ability to study music on their own, it is too late. How cruel this is for them personally, and how serious it is for the national culture!</p>
<p>On the occasion of Children's Day and the music competition held by the Music and Education Association, I wrote this ordinary opinion, hoping that this competition can change parents' traditional concepts and not arbitrarily bury their children's talents; especially hoping that those in power will accept our soft and weak loyal words while dealing with national affairs: no matter what, our nation cannot be without art!</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Story of the Pig Juice Injection <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Martin</p>
<p>——A Fairy Tale for Adults</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a country in the East called Meat-Eating Country. The people there loved to eat meat very much, and they had to eat a little with every meal, otherwise they couldn't swallow the rice. Besides eating meat, they also loved to fight wars. They fought with foreigners and with their own people. After fighting for more than ten years, they became completely impoverished. They originally used "paper coupons" as currency, then changed to "gold coupons"; in the end, they had to change to "diamond coupons," each coupon said to be worth 1.734586 carats—but they couldn't really be exchanged for diamonds. Even so, prices were still soaring every day, especially the meat that everyone had to eat, which cost 10,000 diamond coupons per catty, that is, 10,000 to 10,000+ carats. At first, everyone ate pork and beef, but gradually, even rat meat sold for 5,000 per catty. But they still had to eat it.</p>
<p>The authorities in Meat-Eating Country were at a loss, so they invited a large number of experts from abroad to study the countermeasures. The experts really came, more than two hundred in total. While eating rat meat, they carefully investigated and researched, and finally came up with a solution.</p>
<p>First, they researched that the reason why pork is so delicious is because it contains a kind of "pig juice element"; this pig juice element can be extracted and injected into other animals once a month. After a year, although the animal's appearance will not change, the taste of its meat will be the same as pork.</p>
<p>Secondly, the experts found that there were no animals left in Meat-Eating Country for the pig juice injection. Because of years of consumption, even dog meat had been eaten up, leaving only rats. And rats are too small. Even if they are injected with pig juice, they will not sell for much money by the catty.</p>
<p>Finally, the experts found a solution. They saw the report from the Pushen Mountain Villa in a certain big city in Meat-Eating Country, saying that the corpses collected last winter were about 90 percent children's corpses. According to the report, almost all the female beggars who slept on the streets at night had one or two children who were sallow and emaciated and would die sooner or later. Even the children of good families, although there were many, were also skinny and unable to grow up.</p>
<p>The experts then submitted a report to the Meat-Eating Country government, saying: Since there are so many children in your country, and the poorer the families, the more children they have, and eight or nine out of ten of these children will eventually be buried by Pushen Mountain Villa and will not be able to survive; then why not turn uselessness into usefulness, turn consumption into production, that is: inject them with pig juice, and sell them to slaughterhouses when the time is right. On the one hand, this can solve the meat shortage, and on the other hand, it can allow poor and civil servant parents to have some income. Wouldn't that kill two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>The Meat-Eating Country government immediately adopted this perfect suggestion and ordered its implementation nationwide. In order to increase the meat supply, they set up an agency to manufacture thousands of pig juice injections and distributed them to civil servants as part of their in-kind benefits, so that their children could be injected.</p>
<p>Everyone was very happy. In the homes of civil servants with many children, except for one left to carry on the family line, most of the others were injected with pig juice. From then on, these children injected with pig juice became the family's source of income, and the parents were especially happy with them, giving them nutritious things to eat so that they would be fatter, heavier, and sell for more money.</p>
<p>However, the name "pig" is always very unpleasant. Therefore, they referred to boys or girls who had been injected with pig juice as "Big-Eared Brothers" or "Big-Eared Sisters." When we go to people's houses, we can often hear such conversations:</p>
<p>"How many Big-Eared Brothers do you have? How many catties is the biggest one?"</p>
<p>"We only have two. Your Big-Eared Sister looks like she's more than fifty catties!"</p>
<p>From then on, most of the children in Meat-Eating Country were injected with pig juice and were greatly protected by the government and loved by their parents. And the meat shortage was naturally resolved. In order to commemorate the invention of this foreign expert that enriched the country and benefited the people, they designated the day when the government published the pig juice injection report as "Children's Day"—which is April 4th.</p>
