<h3>參酌中共八項條件　政府商擬和談方案　十人委會起草工作有待</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕李代總統指定研究和平方案之孫科，邵力子，張羣等十人委負會，速日分別交換意見，迄今尙未進入起草階段，和平方案之內容，一部份係參酌中共所提之八項條件加以研討而提出其對案。據悉其中最難解決者爲「戰犯」及「整編軍隊」問題；至「廢止賣國條約」問題則當較易解決，蓋如雙方認爲某條約爲喪失主權者，將來均可予以廢除也。十人委員會中因有二人離京，故對擬訂方案工作尙未達於最後階段·四日政院談話會中亦曾談及和平問題，對和平具有決心及誠意，將以全力排除障碍和平之因素·據京中晚報四日載稱：政府和談代表業已重行派定邵力子，張羣，張治中，鍾天心，吳忠信等五人，但此說尙未獲得證實·</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京四日電〕負責起草和平計劃之政府十人特種委負會，除已對答覆毛澤東八項條件之前四項的對案獲致協議外，並繼續會商，以決定政府對其他四項條件的答覆。前四項之對案，爲：（一）中共對「懲辦戰犯」，必須讓步；（二）憲法可以修改；（三）國民大會及立法院可以解散；（四）在平等之原則下，整編雙方軍隊。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京四日電〕此間一般人士皆認中國和平目前的主要問題，僅爲覓取適當的「保持面子」的公式，就政治上言，人人均承認中國的內戰業已結束。觀察家相信覓取解決辦法的主要障碍，當爲雙方內部的極端份子。在對棘手的懲處戰犯及改編軍隊問題，獲得堪被接受的答案以前，或不免尙有流血事件發生。現中樞方面聞已靜悄悄地敦勸蔣前總統出國，而軍事部隊亦以財政困難爲烟幕，逐漸削减中。國民黨人士大多預料在未來的聯合政府中，共產黨必將取得控制的地位，但彼等仍希望在國民政府治下的各省行政機構中，得以獲得控制的均勢。職是之故，政府正忙於整頓各省人事，以保持更高度的行政效能，同時並將更大的權力，移轉給地方當局。不論最後成立的協定內容如何，相信必能爲政府控制區的大部份區域所接受。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京四日電〕李代總統指定起草和談方案之十人委員會中之兩委員張治中及吳忠信，昨日飛溪口晋謁蔣總統，要求將全權移交李代總統，並請往外國休養。</p>
<h3>今後政院會議　當視事實需要及人數　在京或穗舉行</h3>

<h3>施政報告兩大要點</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕四日政院談話會中，孫院長請各政委分別提供施政報吿意見，現正加以綜合整理中。四日談話會在原則上決定施政方針中將包括和平及革新政治兩大重要部門。關於和平部分係說明政府謀求和平之決心與誠意，以期眞正全面和平之實現。政院並將採取必要措施，以除去障碍和平之因素。關於革新政治部分，方針中將指出革新之重點所在，如廢止征兵征糧實行地方與中央均權制度，實施士地改革整軍裁兵及平衡收支等。會後孫院長在官舍宴請在京政委及各部會首長。</p>
<h3>官兵公敎人員　待遇問題　將再予以調查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕政院談話會中，對財政經濟改革方案實行以來之一般反應及各地物價漲風曾提出檢討，並就穩定物價之有效辦法交換意見，咸認爲目前軍事改革與政治改革均應切實推行，官兵生活及公敎人員待遇尤應迅予改善，其詳細方案應由財政·國防·主計等部首長迅予擬具，早日實施。對於改善公敎人員待遇一點，談話會中咸主應按照當月之生活指數調整，原則上並均同意自本月起實行，惟實行之技術則尙待加以研究。再提出政務會議討論。</p>
<h3>翁文灝堅辭政委</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕翁文灝堅辭政委，四日政院談話會時，孫院長數次派車往接請其出席，翁均拒未前往。</p>
<h3>顧孟餘返滬　無意擔任敎長</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕顧孟餘已兩度晋謁李代總統，聞李代總統曾邀其出任敎育部長，顧因無意參加實際政治，堅辭不就，已於四日離京返滬，顧氏將暫時留滬，不擬他往。</p>
<h3>華北五地尋常電京電局恢復拍發</h3>
<p>郵局五代表卽飛平</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕交通部南京電信局頃奉令，自四日起開始接受發往共區天津·靜海·唐山·塘沽·秦皇島五地尋常電報，本京各營業處均可收受拍發。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕上海電信局長郁秉堅，昨曾趨謁顏惠慶，叩詢有關上海與平·津·瀋陽·濟南·徐州·鄭州等地之恢復電訊問題。據悉：因雙方民衆均願早日恢復電訊交通，故原則上已無困難，唯各項技術問題，須俟指定人員前往洽商細則後，始能實行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕國共通郵問題，經和平代表團洽談，原則已獲同意後，頃已進一步決定由郵局派代表五名飛平，與共方人員研討有關通郵之各項細節·郵政總局局長谷春帆及郵局代表昨分訪顏惠慶及章士釗兩氏，交換意見。又據章氏稱，通郵係包括信件，包裹及匯兌。</p>
<h3>立院討論革新政治　各委主請孫科辭職　和平障礙及破壞者亦須剷除</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕立院四日下午四時一刻於院會後舉行全院秘密談話會，到立委二百餘人，仍由童冠賢主持，各委分別就和平問題及革新政治交換意見，發言者達十餘人，關於和平問題，咸主和平必須貫澈實現，爲求和平，故和平之陣礙及破壞者必須剷除，至和平之方案及條件可不必由立院提出，而責成政院負責。關於革新政治，各委員發言頗爲激昂，咸認爲孫內閣難以達成革新任務，必須請其辭職，迄六時許，要求發言者尙有十餘人，最後決定五日晨九時繼續舉行全院秘密談話會，交換意見。</p>
<h3>于孫分宴地方首長</h3>

<h3>國民黨中政會　將在京舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕某權威人士四日透露，國民黨中央政治會議，可能於最近期內在京舉行，現在京·滬之中政委已遠較在穗者爲多，且政務會議已決定在京舉行，政院局部改組時，新人選之屬於國民黨員者，尙須經中政會之同意，同時，若干重要政策實行前，亦有待於中政會之先行研討審定中政會將在京舉行，甚屬可能。</p>
<h3>李宗仁邀地方首長　入京共商國是　陳誠朱紹良陳濟棠將北來並宴童邵翁孫等交換意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕據政院新聞局駐京辦事處四日息：李代總統爲徵詢各地方軍政首長對國是之意見，曾分批電召各該首長來京，共商國是，除張羣張治中及程潛等業已先後抵京外，四日又分電台灣主席陳誠，閩主席朱紹良，粵主席薛岳，廣州綏署主任余漢謀及海南島行政長官陳濟棠等來京，陳述意見，惟並不採取任何正式會議形式，其他各省府主席亦正陸續分別電召中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕李代總統四日晚宴請童冠賢，邵力子，翁文灝，孫越崎，邱昌渭，韋永成等十餘人，並廣泛交換意見。</p>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕魯主席兼靑巿長奏德純，定五日夜車赴滬轉往靑島履新。</p>
<h3>立院舉行秘密談話會　討論促進和平案　孫科八日報告施政方針</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕立法院四日晨舉行第三會期第二次會議，開始議事，首先處理政院函電三項。次討論保護人民基本自由及釋放政治犯等措施，決咨請政院切實執行。在上述報吿及討諭事項中，均掀起辯論巨波。嗣院長童冠賢宣布，孫院長允於八日來立院，報吿施政方針。下午討論促進全國和平案，經會衆同意改開談話會，並循某委員之請，秘密舉行、</p>
<p>上午會議，因候出席者足法定人數，延至九時三刻始開，院長童冠賢主席，出席委員一六九人，秘書處宣讀報吿事項中之行政院函電三項後，若干委負卽紛起發言，咸指行政院通知立法委員赴穗集會爲不合法，有人主張將該報吿案立卽改爲討論案，進行討論·有人主張應交付審查，再提會討論。一部委員則以旣屬不合法，卽應退回政院，不予接受，爭持良久，最後折衷提出分別處理辦法，卽關於政院電吿在穗集會之會塲宿舍一項，屬於事務性質，應予刪去。關於政院函吿各機關遷往廣州一項，交付審查。關於政院電請通知各委員在穗集會一項，因不合法，予以退回，當經主席提付表決通過。程序委員會擬具之有關各委員會工作進行四點辦法，亦經會衆通過。</p>
<p>釋政治犯等措施咨政院切實執行</p>
<p>休息後開始討論，主席宣吿變更議程，先討論第二案。卽蕭覺天等所提「提前確認政府保護人民基本目由及釋放政治犯等四項文吿爲必要措置，應請行政院切實執行，以平民怨，而重法令案」，原提案人略加說明後，會衆對該案在原則上成表同意，惟對處理方式則發生爭執，部分委員認爲，此事旣已由李代總統電請政院照辦，政院執行不力，立院應提出質詢，故主張改爲質詢案，部份委員則認爲，本案爲適合人心之提案，本院應予以表決通過。同時另有人主張付審查，主席乃以（一）改爲質詢案，（二）交付審查，（三）就原案表決，三項辦法提付表決，在塲委員一六六人，此三項辦法表決時，竟無一能獲得過半數之贊同，於是重新展開激辯，遂有修正原案標題之意見提出，某委員高呼本案爲適應人心者，本案絕不能交付審查，以免啓人疑竇，故必須通過，惟立院應保持超然立塲，故標題必須改正，此議一出，立卽獲得多數掌聲，經表決以大多數通過，修改爲「咨請政院對於保障人民基本自由及釋放政治犯等各項措施，切實執行，以重法治案」，至十二時十五分散會。</p>
<p>午後繼續開會，候至四時五分，始足一六一人，仍由童冠賢主席，進行討論張匯文等所提請舉行全院談話會，研討如何促進全國和平案，張匯文卽席說明，當此嚴重時期，逢此重大問題，吾人在責任上及良心上，不能不作表示，不能不作努力，此種努力及表示，須從長計議，吾人提議開談話會，一爲藉此交換意見，達成共同觀點，一爲等待各地卽將來京同仁趕到參加。某委員發言主張談話會應秘密舉行，請行政院派員出席報吿，並邀請上海人民代表團來會報吿。此外，對主持和平方案之政府各要員，亦當取得密切聯繫，互相交換意見，主席經徵求會衆同意，卽時改開談話會，並循該委員之請，秘密舉行，開會僅十分鐘，新聞記者卽被要求出塲，摒於和平之門以外矣。</p>
<p>程序委會決定第三次會議程</p>
<p>〔本報甫京四日電〕立院程序委會四日晚開會，討論第三會期第三次會議議程，當經決定郵資加價案列入報吿事項，該案係已實行之加價辦法，補行完成立法程序，將交由交通及財金兩委會審查。討論事項中，列有兩案：一爲李峯等一百餘人所提，請行政院各部會首長回京辦公案，四日院會中決定改爲討論事項之行政院函吿政府各機關遷往廣州案，將合併討論。另一爲黄統等提議，請政院停止征兵·征糧案，將交由國防及糧食兩委會審查。</p>
<h3>陳儀行踪成謎　港傳已被禁但無法證實張延哲仍在杭閉門讀書</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前浙省主席陳儀免職後，刻下究往何地，各方均未能有所說明，而將此謎打破。據悉：陳氏卸任後，確曾一度來滬其後卽與錢宗起同行。至外傳陳氏已赴台灣之說，此間亦尙無法予以證實。</p>
<p>〔本報衢州四日電〕外傳陳儀被邀來衢靜養一說，據記者向有關方面查詢，均無法予以證實。周一鶚。錢宗起二人，亦未來衢</p>
<p>〔本報香港四日電〕據此間今日華僑日報載稱：陳儀因「創導局部和平」，已遭因禁·該報又載，陳在主浙時，曾主張以杭州爲不設防城市。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州四日電〕前浙江省政府秘書長張延哲，迄今仍安居杭垣；今晨渠曾以電話向本報辦事處定報，下午記者趨訪，亦曾親與面談，證明外傳陪同陳儀赴浙東某地靜居之說不確。記者與張氏晤見時，渠以不談現實政治之條件下，暢論中西文化以及學術修養等問題。臨別時復稱：渠正擬乘此時機，大可修養讀報，近期內當不致離杭他行。</p>
<h3>章士釗談北平情形</h3>
<p>尙未見特殊變化</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕國共間之和談，顯將於一月內開始，惟國共雙方人士對和戰意見之不一致，迄今猶未獲致結論，記者昨訪晤滬和平代表三老之一章士釗（見圖）氏，據章氏稱：中共方面對和戰問題之意見尙未一致，大致爲文人主和，武人主戰，周恩來雖號稱將軍，仍不失爲文人，渠亦爲主和份子。其次託次記者以中共在北平所採取之措施相詢，因若干人所最關懷者，厥爲今日中共究係以貫澈馬克思主義之推行，抑爲新民主主義之實現。章氏稱，吾人尙看不出北平有何特殊變化，物價雖較京·滬爲高，但彼等係以小米爲標準，波動不大，且正努力就物資之交流與通有無兩點做去，期能收壓低物價之效。記者繼詢以中共在平之一切措施，如實施於上海，是否能行得通？章氏稱：「可以。」因北平的措施是溫和的，且迄今尙未調查戶口，至於中共對新聞紙之統制，停止所有業已轉變態度之報紙之舉動，章氏等曾向中共當局提出詢問，據稱其答覆爲「能認錯」，對平巿議長許惠東之被捕，章氏證實確有其事，惟可能不至有大問題，因許氏原擬南下，爲傅作義所挽留，故許氏被捕後，傅曾代向共方說情。關於傅氏本人之自由問題，章氏稱：「我們尙未看出有不自由的情形。」傅氏曾參加彼等之宴會多次，章氏在平行動亦均自由，惟中共當局爲彼等安全計，常派憲兵「保護」，章氏對與毛澤東等見面談話內容未予透露，僅表示彼等任務業已結束，但對政府代表人選邵力子，張羣將參加認爲有此可能·又章氏短期內將赴京，訪程潛有所晤談。</p>
<h3>美拒絕白銀貸款　認我所鑄銀元有流出國外危險</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕可靠消息稱：美官方已通知中國政府，新近申請之二億美元白銀借款，目前未能允准。其拒絕之主要理由爲政府經濟不穩定，不能由此項借款獲得持久利益，並指出，其所鑄銀元有流出國外或流入共區之危險。聞華北共產區新章，禁止銀元自由流通，現在政府區域內流通之銀元，恐將以使人掀動兌換價，逐漸被吸收入共區。政府向美國申請白銀借款，本欲用以支持經濟新方案，　籌銀元，使其自由流通，但以鑄幣設備不足，未能大量吸收其所借銀塊，亦與美方之決定有關。財政部長徐堪承認政府曾向美國接洽白銀借款，但未有成議。上海中央銀行則稱，政府仍謀向美國商借白銀。</p>

<p>顧大使稱：渠之訪問威勃，「與軍事援助基金之運用問題有關，意欲明瞭如何引用四月三日之限期，俾使此項基金獲得儘量之利用」。渠指出：若干物資向廠家購買，困難甚多，因此，在四月三日之賬目中，或有不少基金尙未用去，顧大使稱：由於渠此一訪問之結果，此項基金在限滿後是否將重予分配問題，現正研究中。</p>
<p>顧大使並討論中國向經濟合作總署請求基金五十萬美元，以資救濟中國留美學生一事。</p>
<p>目下在美之中國留學生三千六百人，其中若干亟需經濟援助。顧大使稱：渠雖未獲得威勃之具體答復，但若干人對於此等中國留美學生之福利，甚爲關心。渠稱：中國政府正在資助學業已完畢之中國學生買棹返國，但若干學生尙未畢業，而仍需經濟援助。</p>

<h3>團結　革新　謀和</h3>
<p>上海和平代表團完成任務，欣然歸來，全國和平的空氣亦因而頓時濃厚起來。顏惠慶博士携回中共主席毛澤東致李代總統一函，說明中共方面定於三月十五日以後發表和談代表名單，確定和談地點並即開始進行談判。此函當可說明上海和平代表團所謂「中共已願與政府在平等基礎上進行和談」並非虛語。同時，李代總統爲表示政府謀和的誠意起見，特於」日召集中樞及地方的首長，舉行會議，當塲指定十人負責起某和談方案，限於十日內完成，其內容如何，目前雖尙不可知，但從各方面動態看來，和平前途似乎已獲得鼓勵，天際陰霾或有因此開朗的希望。</p>
<p>不過和平的道路，眞是任重而道遠。上海和平代表團書面談話稱：「和談前途雖困難尙多，而希望甚大」。反過來看，也可以說，一希望雖甚大，而困難尙多」。國共之間，有十多年的離合悲歡史，其猜疑之來，非一朝一夕之故，今欲其釋嫌修好，自非一蹴可成。但若雙方都能推誠相見，以國家人民爲重，而隨時隨事，相互都能容忍，自亦不難將往日積嫌，渙然氷釋，所以，我們對於和談開始以前雙方所作的準備工作，不能不特別重視。中共方面的眞實情况，我們無法知道，姑置勿輪，但對於政府最近所作種種促進和平的努力，則願乘立院檢討和平方案之際，貢獻一些意見。</p>
<p>第一，謀和必須有誠意，政府更不能不有竭誠謀和的事實表現出來，自不待言；但單靠一方面的誠心誠意，不惜委曲求和，如果對方沒有誠意，和談也是不易成功的。和談好比夫妻反目以後的言歸於好，不是夫　三分，就得妻讓三分，彼此回想往日舊情，有好在前，則破鏡尙可重圓，何况其他？然而其關鍵就在於雙方的確要能够忍讓。其次和談又好比巿塲上的買賣，大概要經過一番「討價還價」，才會「成交」，不管賣方把「虛頭」開得如何高，不管買方要怎樣「殺半價一只要雙方眞有做成這宗交易的誠意，這一筆買賣終有成交的可能。以此例彼，無論那一方而，不要把此次謀和，看做投降與受降，然後可望成功。否則一定要使李代總統的代表被迫接受默書式的和平條件，那就不像和談，而是無條件投降了。至於政府如何取得這個平等地位、最重要的，乃在政府內部的精誠團結。團結就是力量，有力量始能半衡。所以，我們對於政府最近謀和的努力，一直是以這個尺度去權衡的。凡足以削弱政府在和談中的地位之措施，就是最能表示政府有和平誠意者，也不是智者所應爲，其對於和平前途，只有百害而無一利。縱　假借外國通訊社記者的一支筆，製造謠言，挑撥離間，一若必如此而後可以快意，其實對和談與中國前途是有損無益的。</p>
<p>第二，中國經過八年抗戰之後，又接踵發生三年多的內爭，全國人民都成了刧後的災黎，戰禍若不能立即停止，則多苦多難的人民將有活不下去之感。雙方表示願意進行和談早日結束戰爭，也都一再說明是爲了憐惜人民的痛苦。但今日和戰未定，還要拖延一個相當長的時間，政府豈可袖手旁觀聽任人民痛苦拖延下去？所以政府在和談期間，爲軫念人民的痛苦起見，除了竭誠謀和早日實現和平而外，還應該「盡其在我」，革新政治，以减輕人民的痛苦，凡爲人民所痛心疾首的庶政，都應該立即終止。孫院長日昨在京向記者所表示的各點，如改徵兵爲募兵，並進而栽减兵額，同時取消徵糧徵借等等，我們但願其早日兌現，不再被議爲空頭支票。</p>
<p>要之，團結，革新，謀和，已是當前的國是，政府應傾全力以赴，但是「天下興亡，匹夫有責」，全國上下對於促進和平的實現，人人負有其責任。大家都應該知道，和平不能自天而降，而是要人民努力取得的。國共和談在即，全國人民都應該站出來，提供人民的意見，發揮人民的力量，使雙方都不能不順從民意，棄戰霄和。</p>
<h3>傅共軍對渡江攻勢　擬定初步行動計劃　陳毅部負下游任務着重鎮江蕪湖兩地　林彪部兩縱隊南下抵漯河</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江四日電〕據國防部通報稱：林彪部第三第五兩縱隊，自二月初離津甫下後，經德州，濟南，徐州轉沿隴海鐵路西進抵鄭州，復沿平漢路南下，近已抵達　河。記者按據未經證實之情報：共軍前次在華中某地召開之中原軍事會議中，除決定陳賡担任西綫兵團司令員及陳毅擔任東綫兵團司令員而外，幷就渡江攻勢擬訂初步行動計劃如次：（一）陳毅部擔任下游渡江任務，其重點着重蕪湖，鎭江兩地，攻佔京滬後，將直下杭州；（二）陳賡部渡江之處取道宜（昌）沙（市）然後向粵漢綫迂迥東進；（三）中央兵團以林彪部爲主力，於擊潰武漢外圍國軍後，沿粵漢綫南下進攻長沙，俟與陳賡都取得聯繫，再行西窺九江，截斷浙贛路，向杭州方而進擊，呼應陳毅之攻勢</p>
<h3>蘇北共軍積極部署　陳兵江岸調遣頻繁</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江四日電〕蘇北共軍積極部署，有陳兵江岸威脅江南之勢。鎭江當面之施家橋橋頭堡國軍陣地，刻已嚴密戒備。本日正面共軍情况又有轉變，據軍息：（一）開抵橋頭堡當面運河東岸之共軍，除第十縱隊之一部約千餘人外，尙有淮河大隊之一部約六百餘人，及江都獨立團之一部約五百餘人。（二）原駐運河東岸之共軍淮海獨立旅，刻已調赴東台整訓。（三）運河西岸共軍仍爲新六團及興化獨立團兩部。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江四日電〕蘇北共軍調遣頻繁，據報：陳毅部第十一縱隊主力集中口（岸）泰（縣）綫，刻正向泰興方面移動；第十二縱歐已抵達邵伯仙女廟一綫，一第十縱隊則進駐揚州，並有一部一約千餘人南進至施家橋國軍陣地當面（在運河東岸地區）。另據空軍昨日偵察報吿：通榆棧上東合至海安之間，及海泰綫姜堰至海安之間，均發現各有約二萬五千人之共軍行列，向海安方面集中。另有約一萬五千人之一部共軍，則由海安沿公路向如臯方面行動。以上共軍總計達六萬人，顯與日前空軍在鹽城阜寗間發現之共軍九千餘人南下之一情報有關。該部共軍之番號，軍方尙未接獲正確情報，惟關係方面力稱該部共軍決爲自兩淮地區南移之第十，第十一，第十二。三個縱隊以外之部隊，而可能係自魯南調來者。綜觀蘇北沿江一綫，除揚州天長間原駐有共軍第二，第三，第九及渤海，快速等五個縱隊外，一般人士相信共軍將以自兩淮南下之十，十一，十二，三個縱隊運用於揚州至泰興之綫，而由通榆綫南下之一部可能調集至靖江以下及南通東西兩側之江岸，以擺出渡江之姿態。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江四日電〕據悉：共軍駐揚州之某高級指揮所刻在南門外，第十縱隊之司令部則在北門外鳳凰橋。又，福運門外共軍架設山砲一門。</p>
<p>〔中央社鎭江四日電〕江北共軍南移，除三汶河二日晚有小接觸外，預料三數日內瓜洲方面可能有小爭奪戰發生。總計揚泰高寶方面共軍計有二·十·十一·十二·四縱隊番號，其東南支隊及揚儀地方團隊則在瓜洲附近竄擾，實力不大，其高寶兩泰之地方團隊，則在揚州以東及泰興以南活動，似欲擾口岸，龍窩諸橋頭堡，其南來動機，顯爲政治性重於軍事性者，次則爲移兵就食，兼以充實其新近佔領區域云。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京四日電〕鎭江來電稱：鎮江對岸國軍兩橋頭堡附近昨夜續有戰事發生，共軍千餘名，曾在施家橋迤西與國軍激戰三小時，三渡河附近亦有戰事，今日傳共軍正向儀徵推進，故鎭江與北岸間之渡船已吿停駛，儀徵方面已有船舶集積凖備撤退。</p>

<h3>挪威決定參加大西洋盟約　初次出席華府會談　丹麥亦與挪採取同一步驟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓四日廣播：挪威駐美大使摩根斯蒂納於今午參加大西洋公約談判，頗受各國代表歡迎。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓四日廣播：北大西洋公約之談判今晨十一時鐵在國務院舉行，討論主題仍爲應邀請何國參加該約。今日挪大使曾於十一時半訪艾契遜，並定舫晤後立卽參加談判，但法大使龐納稱，今晨之會恐尙不能獲得結論。</p>
<p>〔合衆社奧斯陸四日電〕挪威議會四日以壓倒多數通過挪威參加大西洋公約之談判·挪議會此舉，係在挪政府率直拒絕蘇聯所提訂立互不侵犯協定之建議後不久·</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕外交界人士四日稱，丹麥不久將諒將繼挪威而參加大西洋公約之談判，方面且稱，義大利·冰島·及葡萄牙亦在考慮參加公約之條件。西方列強相信克林嫌宮將在言詞方面而非行動方面來抵制該公約，但亦感覺有若干顧慮，卽紅軍或將進軍芬蘭，作爲「保障措置」。挪威參加大西洋公約後，將公約範圍延達蘇聯之前門。外交官員等覺得挪威之加入公約談判，將使歷時八閱月之談判進展至成功階段，可能使該公約於十日內簽訂。各官員正亟於使該公約儘早簽訂，批准及實行。</p>
<p>〔路透社渥太華三日電〕加拿大外長皮爾森今日在此間招待記者談稱，加拿大巳接獲北大西洋大約草案之全文，大致堪稱滿意。目前尙待繼續討論者爲該約總則篇之措辭，及何國得被邀參加該約，一般相信加拿大已吿知公約其他各國，聲明並不反對義大利之參加。皮氏復稱，在美京參與會談之各大使如能同意公佈該約內容之時間，則該約至下星期卽可公佈·另悉，加政府業已決定各大使縱使不獲同意，加政府不久亦將擇要公佈該約內容，俾人民得以獲知·關於該約簽字地點，各國代表尙未決定，皮氏認爲最可能之地點爲百慕大島。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三日電〕消息靈通人士稱，北大西洋公約將在華盛頓簽字，不致在加勒比安海之百慕大島簽字。</p>
<h3>蘇建議締互不侵犯條約　挪覆文率直拒絕　保證不以基地讓與他國　願繼續保持對蘇聯友誼</h3>
<p>〔路透社奧斯睦四日電〕挪戚外交部昨以覆牒一紙，送達蘇聯駐挪大使，拒絕蘇聯建議之與挪締結互不侵犯條約，聲明挪威係隸屬西歐者。今晨公佈之覆牒，，以客氣友善但堅決的口吻，正吿蘇聯以挪威由於準備加入北大西洋公約，不能與蘇締結任何軍事協定·由於北大西洋公約條款完全符合聯合國憲章的精神及規定，故挪威已決定參加該約。</p>
<p>此外，挪威相信決不致遭受蘇聯的攻擊，故無與蘇締結互不侵犯條約之必要。挪威將縱續對蘇保持友誼，但今後與蘇所簽的任何友好條約，應以相對爲原則·覆牒於提及北大西洋公約時，聲明挪政府願向蘇聯保證，決不以挪威領土內之任何基地讓與北大西洋公約之任何簽字國，預料亦不致發生足以推翻此項政策的局勢。覆牒繼復允諾挪威之繼續謀取對蘇商務關係之促進，並建議設法促進兩國間之文化及敎育諒解。照會繼稱，挪威雖決定將其命運與西歡聯繫，但北大西洋公約之性質，原以斯坎的那維亞國家與蘇聯間共同諒解之促進爲最大的期望。挪威係於鄭重考慮之後，始決定拒絕與蘇締結互不侵犯條約。挪威報紙今晨悉以顯要標題，刋載挪政府之決議。「社會日報」稱之爲劃時代的決議，決無退回之理。蘇大使於接獲該照會後，拒絕發表意見，惟挪威共黨立卽發表聲明，譴責政府此一行動挪國會人士莫不支援政府之決策，挪外長蘭琪之發言人吿記者曰，關琪不信挪威關係將因此趨劣。蘭氏於採取此一決定前，曾考慮再三，曾特別赴華盛頓及倫敦一行。發言人又日，瑞典及丹麥對挪威此一決議亦均然覺滿意云。</p>
<h3>丹芬奧共黨　聲明支援蘇職</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三日電〕芬蘭及丹麥共黨今夜發表聲明，與英美法義奧各國共黨採取一致態度，謂東西兩方如發生戰爭，各該國共產黨員不惜擁護蘇聯。〔聯合社維也納三日電〕奧共黨今日發表聲明稱，該黨將在戰時擁護蘇聯，該黨現有武裝人員五千名左右，惟悉奧國大多數人民均反對共黨·</p>
<h3>維辛斯基離捷克</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社捷京三日電〕官方宣佈，蘇外次維辛斯基今日已離捷克，同時消息靈通人士今日否認外國方面關於捷境內最近舉行東歐聯防條約談判之傳說。爲土軍官被拘捕事</p>
<h3>土決向海牙法庭　對保提控訴</h3>
<p>為土軍官被拒捕事</p>
<p>〔路透社伊斯坦埠三日電〕此間正式宣布土陸軍中尉一名於一九四八年三月悮入保加利亞境被拘，迄今未釋，土已決定向海牙國際法提起申訴。該中尉於去歲十月被保法庭依間諜罪判死刑，後以土政府以與保絕交爲恐嚇，死刑遂未執行。其後土國建議將該案交轉解決，亦遭保政府拒絕。</p>
<h3>杜魯門斥責美共</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞社華盛頓三日電〕杜魯門今日招待記者，有人請總統對美共領袖最近聲明發表意見。總統答稱，「余對叛國者所作之聲明並無意見」。按美共領袖近構，渠等將反對美蘇衝突時「美國帝國主義之掠奪性的戰爭目的。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕衆院非美活動委會激於美共領袖的親蘇立塲，三日宣稱，該會將立卽開始進行饑格管制共黨的法案。委會主席胡特宣佈，兩黨國會義負保證擊被美共黨，俾保朧開家免受破壞。</p>
<h3>保收師案審結</h3>

<p>〔聯合社保加利亞京城四日電〕基督敎牧師十五人以叛國罪被控，共黨檢察官喬其夫今日總結全案，指各被吿不僅作間諜活動，且圖引起叛雙，使英美出而干涉，要求處主犯四人以極刑。</p>
<h3>蘇建議國際管制原子彈　聯合國應予考慮　美國科學家聯合會發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕美國科學家聯合會今日發表聲明，對聯合國原子能委員會於長期沉寂之後恢復討論，表示滿意。但謂蘇聯提議成立國際管制機構，同時應毀滅原子武器，聯合國應予以詳細攷慮。安理會新近辯論原子能問題時，蘇聯曾指責美國企岡囤積原子彈，威脅世界，並要求各大國於三月底以前通知聯合國各有原子彈若干。蘇聯堅持原子武器應認爲非法，並於成立國際管制方案以前將其毀滅，後又在聯大會議中提議兩者可以同時進行，此舉實爲趨向協議之一個重要步驟，聯合國原子能委員會自應予以詳細考慮。</p>
<h3>福萊斯特辭職照准　約翰遜繼長國防　陸長羅雅爾仍有倦動意</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕杜魯門總統今日宣布國防部畏福萊斯特以私人要事呈請辭職，將于本月卅一日卸任，其遺缺由前陸軍部次長約翰遜承乏。陸軍部長羅雅淾·海軍部長蘇利文及空軍部長薛明頓三人仍留任。</p>
<p>杜氏並出示其與福氏來往函札稱余雖准予辭職，實非所願，希望仍能在旁協助政府鞏固國防。福氏年五十七歲，自一九四四年五月至一九四七年七月任海軍部長，爲故總統羅斯福執政時代碩果僅存之要員，去年大先時卽有退出內閣之說。</p>
<p>新任部長約翰遜爲西浮琴尼亞州律師，現年五十八歲，一九三七年至一九四〇年故羅斯福總統再皮蟬聯，出任陸軍部次長。去年曾充民主黨財政委會主席，在該黨競選總統希望黯淡期間，負責籌募競選經費，甚爲出力。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕陸軍部長羅雅爾今日在總統宣佈任命約翰遜出長國防防部後卽致函道賀，並在記者招待會重申倦勤之意，據稱，「一俟問心無疚，希望解職回籍」。</p>
<h3>約翰遜表談話　美須保持強大軍力</h3>
<p>否則世界無和平可言</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓四日廣播：美新任國防部長約翰遜頃發表談話稱，美國必須保持强大之軍事實力，因美國若不堅强有力，則世界將無和平可言·約翰遜今日曾與前部長福萊斯特在白宮晤面，約翰遜並透福氏已於數日前將此訊吿渠·約翰遜將於三月卅一日就職，預料參院當可批准渠之任命·福氏談稱，對離職後之新計劃尙未決定，惟渠將向國會提出建議，要求修改一九四七年通過之陸海空軍統一指揮法案，因目前三軍之統一程度，實尙未能令人滿意。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三日電〕此間觀察家認爲杜魯門任命空軍專家約翰遜爲國防部長，象徵美國空軍將大事整頓。約翰遜爲伏爾蒂飛機廠董事，曾在故總統羅斯福時代躬自規劃B17型飛行堡壘之製造，並在第一次世界大戰伊始，負責以軍火運英，不顧陸軍部同僚之反對。約翰遜並爲「戰略空軍司令部」之發起人，故其登台將促成陸長羅雅爾之辭職，蓋羅氏抱陸軍第一主義故也。</p>
<h3>以色列新閣組成　申請加入聯合國可獲批准</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約四日廣播：台拉維夫訊：以色列新總理古利翁今日通知魏茲曼　統，渠已組成四黨聯合內　·古利翁所領導之勞工黨在新　中佔十一席。該四黨可在講會中得七十五票，已逾半數，故信任案必可通過。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖四日電〕聯合國安理會今日表決以色列申請加入聯合國案，大致可獲通過。中美法蘇四大國均將投贊成票，英國已表示不擬使用否決權·</p>
<h3>福萊斯特去職主要原因有三</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三日電〕外交界人士今日稱，美國防部長一福萊斯特之辭職，主要原因有三，其一，福氏對阿猶爭執問題，素來主張美國支援阿拉伯各國，以便保護美國在中東之油權，但民主黨領袖則反對此種見解。國務院中東司長韓德森因贊同福氏之主張而被逼辭職，福氏因亦感不安於位。其二，福萊斯特反對挪威參加北大西洋公約，認爲此舉違反美國之軍略利益，國務院方面則贊同挪威參加。其三，福氏素來主張陸海空三軍實力平均，亦爲主張擴大空軍派所反對·又據合衆社訊，福萊斯特在政府內部之爭執中，頗有牽遞，並據報渠對聖地及其他外交問題，曾與總統爭吵。渠家雖富裕，但在杜魯門競選期間，並未予以多大之經濟或其他支持。</p>
<h3>四強邀請南奧代表　辯論奧和約細節</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日廣播：四强外長代表會議今日決定邀請南斯拉夫及奧代表到會，辯論奧和約之各細節，惟渠等究應於何時出席，則四强激辯三小時後，仍未獲得結論，旋決定休會至下星期一再行討論。今日蘇代表堅持南代表必須先出席發表意見，然後四强再作討論，其意顯欲南國於對奧要求中再作新的讓步。</p>
<h3>以色列外約但　和談陷停頓</h3>
<p>以黎談判已達成協議</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅特島三日電〕外約但堅持將阿拉伯難民問題置於議程之首，使以色列外約但休戰談判擱淺。又以色列與黎巴嫩協定之簽訂，因凖備翻譯之技術困難，可能延至四日或五日，但官方稱，協定已接近完成。據稱，協定中包括甫大要點：（一）在有利於以色列情形下，重訂兩國邊界錢，（二）以色列將若千在口袋西南角所一佔黎巴撇村落，州　黎巴　膩。</p>
<h3>南非擬提高　世界黃金官價</h3>
<p>美財長史奈德表示反對</p>
<p>〔聯俁社華盛頓三日〕財長史奈德今日宣稱，美國贊成國際貨幣基金團與南非聯邦爲金價問題之爭執，美國堅持世界黄金官價應維持每盎斯三十五元之原價。南非政長所謂此種官價不能持久之說，碍難同意。南非爲世界最大產金國，擬將金價提高六元五角，成爲四十一元五角一盎斯</p>
<h3>蘇遣僑卸下國旗　撤離德境美佔區　蘇施報復逐走美軍英靈保管團</h3>
<p>〔聯合社法蘭克福四日〕蘇聯今日對美國壓力屈服，令其遺僑團撤離此間。團員共八人，今晨卸下國旗，憤然離辦事處，分乘汽車三輛與卡車二輛赴德境蘇區。</p>
<p>車上滿堆行李，與破舊車胎及汽油桶。撤退時面部嚴肅，車夫並對路旁美國女郎吐痰侮辱。屋內雜亂不堪，代表團事前曾燒毀文件，耗數小時之久，但全部行李均經美憲兵檢查。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林四日電〕蘇遺僑團今晨進入蘇區後，立卽搭機返莫斯科，向本國政府提出報吿。約在同時，被蘇軍司令索柯洛夫斯基下令逐出之美軍英靈保管委員團亦自蘇區抵達柏林，柏林美軍司令霍萊吿記者日，克萊將軍將就該事向蘇抗議，因戰時美軍陣亡將士屍體尙有許多未在蘇區發見，故其任務尙未結束故也。</p>
<h3>關於蘇遣僑事件　美拒蘇抗議</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕美政府頃以照會一紙，送達莫斯科蘇外部，藉以答覆蘇政府於二月廿事件之照會。美覆文斷然拒絕蘇聯之抗議，並指其完全曲解事實。蘇抗議書內指美國之行動，違背一九四五年二月在克里米亞所簽之遣僑協定，復指德境美官員阻撓遣僑團之工作·美覆文對此項指責，一概加以拒絕，並聲明美政府完全批准美軍統司令令克萊將軍之立塲，並要求蘇遣僑團立卽退出美佔區。文內復指出每月經蘇遣僑團遣回之人不足九人，以後遣僑工作可由蘇聯軍事團辦理。關於蘇抗議內所指德境反蘇團體之活動，阻撓蘇遣僑工作等節，美覆文斥爲不能接受。</p>
<h3>蘇聯對印度　將施政治壓力</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日廣播：英政府遠東專家咸料蘇聯將對印度施以政治壓力。渠等表示；挪威拒絕與蘇聯簽訂互不侵犯協定後，蘇聯向西方之擴展巳遇挫折，而將改向東方發展。渠等認爲上星期加爾各答之暴動，及孟加拉政府之禁止共黨活動，事實上均並未削减共黨之實力，蓋印度政府之宣布反共政策，實已使共黨自公開活動改而從事地下工作，而共黨業已取得各重要工會之領導權。此外，蘇聯之在新疆擴展力量，莫斯科電台之攻擊尼赫魯，皆可視爲蘇聯覬覦印度之跡象</p>
<h3>英機百零三架　贈與印空軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約四日廣播：孟買訊：英政府決以英飛一百架及噴射式三架讓與印度空軍。印空軍總司令愛爾默斯德今日已乘輪赴英視察此項飛機。</p>
<h3>英下院以壓倒多數　通過龐大軍事費　國防部長力爲政策辯護</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦三日電〕下院今夜以二二七票對三票通過英國和平時期最大軍事預算，計共七億五千九百八十六萬鎊。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三日電〕下院今日辯論政府之國防政策時，國防大臣亞歷山大首先致辭，力言蘇聯旣保留其對「和平與安全的否決權」，英國必須在世界自由民族的防務責任中，負起充分的一部份。</p>
<p>亞氏稱，英國始終相信英國必須集團行動。在今日之世界上，以爲一國可以閉關自守，絕不可能。蒙哥馬利元帥主持下的西歐聯盟防務委會，正在擬具應付任保緊急導師變的計劃，而西歐各國國防部長亦已獲有相當的進展。談及北大西洋公約時，亞氏表示在現階段下，未便有何申述，但此一協定業已在討論中的事實，値得充份重視。亞氏並向下院保證，英國具有足量的軍用配備存貨，並政府尙不以此爲已滿足，蓋當現在擬具中的防務計劃充份發揮其效能以後，其所需配備當較現存在進步多多，談及殖民地防務時，亞歷山大謂最近的事件顯示殖民地內推動經濟發展的必要，故一時尙不宜大規模發展當地之防軍，但維持內部安全的需要，亦已獲有充份的認識。殖民地政府已從事種種努力，以充實其地方警衛力量。其後反對黨動議拒絕批准政府之防務政策聲明，指其內容不當，結果被以二九一對一五五票否決。</p>
<h3>荷與印尼領袖尙待洽商　海牙會議將延期　美反對聯合國派遣代表出席</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞三日電〕消息靈通人士稱：定三月十二日於海牙召開之圓桌會議，可能延期，因與印尼共和國領袖舉行初步談判，需要相當時間。據悉：現在邦加之印尼領袖，對圓桌會議之意見甚不一致。一派以哈泰爲首，主張參加，另一派以共和國代表團團長維姆爲首，主將拒絕參加。因荷蘭召開圓桌會議，無異拒絕安理會一月廿八日之建議。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約四日廣播：聯合國機構菲代表羅慕洛，今午邀宴曾出席新德里會議之各國駐聯合國代表，非正式交換對印尼問題之意見。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖三日電〕荷蘭駐聯合國機構代表霍格隆奇今日致函安理會値月主席卽古巴代表亞伐勒斯，要求聯合國派遣代表，參加三月十二日在海牙舉行之印荷圓桌會議·函內稱，荷蘭之議，殊途同歸，均以促成印尼獨立爲目的，故安理會應翼贊其成·安理會可望於下星期一討論印尼問題。美國方面發言人稱，美國將反對聯合國代表參加圓桌會議，除非印尼共和國領袖同意出席。據巴達維亞消息，印尼共和國領袖已拒絕參加荷蘭已承認另團體，使其代表印尼共和國出席。</p>

<p>十五年前，這童山濯濯荒僻無人的地方，但今天却只見烟囱林立，房屋櫛比，機器與機器接吻的聲音，震耳欲聾。「有志者事竟成」，楊吉煇笑了。十五年前，他帶了一批幹部來此建廠，他親自督工，寢饋於工廠，從事死拚，漸漸將那些陳舊不堪的機器東拚西湊，安裝起來，從事踏入試騐階段。熊天祉氏被他聘請來主持冶煉及工務方面的事宜，這位留法習礦冶的中年人，嘴角上始終掛着笑痕，穿着藍布大褂，整日與工人在一起生活，漸漸的在熊氏襄助下，他的歌素鋼出鑪，一切也較以前進步了，該廠由中央接管後，歸兵工署轄制，抗戰進入第二期後，海口被封鎖，原料機械無法進口，兵工署是獨立單位，一切必須設法自給自足。楊氏此時方才漸被人重視，而他自已也更加警惕。</p>
<p>無名的英雄</p>
<p>正當那時資委會官費資送赴德的一批人，學成歸國了，因爲這批人材，是學礦冶的，於是遂由資委會轉介與楊氏，其實這批人就是勝利以後派赴鞍山·台灣·接收的主腦人員，也就是孫越崎氏心目中的中國冶煉權威楊樹棠。李松堂。毛鶴年諸氏。楊樹棠在德國大學畢業後，復在德國鋼鐵托辣斯克虜伯工廠實習一段時期，然後回到這多難的祖國，被派在這萬山重疊中的重工業雛兒　抱下，展開工作，他當時眼見廠中設備陳舊，技術落後，但他却被這位廠長苦幹與毅力所感動，有次他以工程師的身份去問當時的工務處長熊天祉氏說：</p>
<p>「我們鍊鋼，爲什麽要這樣多的時候？」</p>
<p>「設備不够呵！」</p>
<p>「我辦起來，只要一半的時候。」</p>
<p>「你——可不要開玩笑！」熊天社笑了，這笑裏包含着多少興奮與鼓勵，他深知這批人是要一顯身手的，但他的習慣與經騐却吿訴他不敢貿然決定。</p>
<p>「好吧！你來試試看。」</p>
<p>兵工署負責高級技術人士全到了，都希望一覩中國冶煉史上的奇蹟，在預定時間裏，火光四濺，熱氣逼人，鋼出鑪了，送到化騐部份去檢騐一切，延展硬度都符合標凖，而時間上却减少一半。緊接着，李松堂氏由漢陽廠撤下來已被視爲廢料的機械，凑成了廿八吋的軋鋼機。</p>
<p>齊熨，這位榮膺德國國家博士，面孔修潔，有着紳士風度的ＤOCTOR，解決了中國幾十年來冶鍊史上迄未解決的耐火材料問題，那時鋼鑪所用的耐火磚，必須在美國購買，遠渡重洋，經由駝峯空運進來，假如氣候縣劣，飛機脫了班，那就必須停工，以待物料的續運。齊熨用一些廢料做成耐火磚，效用與美國造的無異，而價格却僅及他的百分之一</p>
<p>沒有他，也許西南一帶的重工業還要延遲十年。</p>
<p>堅毅與苦幹</p>
<p>當他五十歲那年，全廠的職工追隨他，都差不多十年了，大家決定舉行一個慶祝會。當這個意見經由工友代表及另一位高級人員吿訴他時，他用一種冰冷的熱情拒絕了這種好意，他說：</p>
<p>「大家別忘了現在是什麽時候，戡亂方殷，前方需要日多，我們正應當加緊生產，我感謝大家純正的動機，但我拒絕大家這種好意」。這時，廣大的職工羣衆，却不接受他這個意見，他們認爲假如廠長不接受這一建議，這無異乎承認他與職工間一點情感上的連繫都沒有了，火一樣的熱情終於遮沒了楊氏冰冷的情緒，他在無可奈何的情緒下，接受了一件紀念品，一付紙對聯。</p>
<p>三十一年，敵人對於這個後方僅有的冶鍊設備，不斷加以轟炸，防空設備旣然談不上，只好任他炸，被炸的次數太多了，於是對於搶救的情緒也降低了。就在一次該廠被投下燃燒彈，火頭四起時，他親自拿了水帶去救火，他說：「這些東西全是民脂民膏買來的呀，你知道沒有這些東西，抗戰會到甚麽地步？」他用－種淡淡的毫無火氣的聲音，不願別人的勸阻，也不顧自身的安全，冒險搶救機器。</p>
<p>如今，他的太太巳死去，他每天住在廠裏與職工一道進餐，他沒有小廚房，更沒有私人廚子。　堅毅苦幹——這是楊吉煇的個性。</p>
<p>動心的故事</p>
<p>當我在該廠作第四次訪問後，我始終忘不了那廣大職工羣衆裏所傳誦的一個動人心魄的故事。　崔之雄這位籍隸安徽說着一口漂亮的四川話的高大搜削的中年人，是楊氏基本幹部之一，追隨他達十二年以上。他担任楊氏的行政秘書，能詩能文，一筆大字，半瓶老酒，能幹孤傲，有魄力，但却不善鑽營，自謂是個有性格的廉吏。兵工廠因爲待遇問題設有個比較龐大的福利機構解決職工生活及日用必需品間題，當前一任處長不辭而去時，楊氏命他這位老幹部出來，肩此巨任，當他就任那天，用一種極堅定的語氣向他的部屬說：「……我們今後要切實改掉那不患寡而患不均的毛病，那怕只是一點極少量的東西，我們也必須要使每個人分得一點。</p>
<p>在大轟炸時，他穿起草鞋，督率工人搶救物資，那時兵工廠每天工作十小時，但他常常早上七點鐘去，晚上九點鐘才下辦公室，中午兩個燒餅，算是他的午餐，戰時工人的主食品，當局准由軍糧項下撥充，但領用手續，却相當麻煩，以致不能按時領到，而米質粗劣，亦爲不可避免的事實，於是一羣被人鼓動的工人到他家裏去質問他，那時他正在用晚餐，飯碗裏盛着一碗滲合了穀稗沙粒的平價八寶飯，中間放着一碗毫無油氣的水煮白菜，原來，上自廠長，下到小工，全吃的這種米，並無軒輊。</p>
<p>他這種作風，折服了每一個人，使他們默然退去。正當這時，他最喜歡的一個孩子因他平時忙於公務而疏忽了，患了急性肺炎，醫生診治的結果，需要一筆不很小的數目，他極親信的一位課員向他建議，在公款內動支一部，以後慢慢的還，但他却拒絕了還良美的善意，他說：「謝謝集，可是我寗可讓我的孩子死掉，而不做這種自私的事」。淸廉的節操觀念，在他心裏依然佔着一個不小的地位。</p>
<p>祝福楊吉煇</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，楊吉煇赴東兩各地參觀，以爲他日擴廠的借鏡，這次的巡視眞使他百感交集，自已的工業眞太落後了，他唯一可吿慰的，是爲國家保留了一批人材，只要有重工業的地方，就有楊氏的舊部。楊氏本人主持冶煉工業已十五年，以他的好學不倦不恥下問的精神，他今天似乎也可擠身於專家之列了，他看了台灣上海東北各地的重工業後，他寫了一篇萬言以上的演講稿，指示冶煉工業技術上應改良之處，他認爲在這戡亂的時候，軍火需要量激增，但他却不贊成增加工人，他認爲技術人材，要人少，要質精，與其增加工人，不如設法增加工人效率。與其等待美援與賠償物資，不如我們自已先來做。他滿心希望今後能供應西南一帶的工業用鋼，同時他希望副產品工塲也能加緊生產，則以後洋釘鋼絲等，在西南庶不虞匱乏。</p>
<h3>今日浙江　物運會</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>我們應該質詢浙江物資運用委會：運用物資後對地方的裨益究有若干？對物資的改良生產到底收穫到多少效果？</p>
<p>〔本報杭州三日訊〕浙江省之有物資運用委員會，是陳公治主浙的時候創辦的，這個物運會是陳氏治閩時的物產統制運銷委會治合時的專賣局與物資調節委員會方式的化身。本意是因爲省財政支絀，赤字龐大，全賴中央補助始得勉可維持，沒有剩餘的錢來辦理新興的事業，於是設立了物資運用委負會把浙省的物資，對省外交換物資或金錢，來興辦事業。所謂物資運用，我們就字面看，當不僅把物資集中統制外銷，應該還有改良物資的任務。使浙省物資趨於優良化，標凖化，始能獲取省外的信仰，進而樂於購儲浙省的物資。</p>
<p>無本錢生意</p>
<p>浙省物運會成立之初，主任委員任顯羣笑說：「這是做無本錢生意」。誠然，浙省物運會沒有支用浙省行政經費，完全自力更生的，他們是盡量設法與中央金融及物資機構取得聯繫，先從代購浙省特產入手，建立信用，一面洽准中央銀行撥借一部週轉資金以爲本身運用的開端。他們已做了代中央收購綠蔴計六萬〇三百四十二市担。購儲民食食米共三萬一千一百八十市石（內奉准價讓杭市政府一萬五千石及浙鹽務局等四百四十石，）運銷鹽斤十五萬祖，換取贛米約一萬七千三百三十三石，代購糧食部部糧購起糙米七萬三千五百十四大包及稻穀二萬一千二百十九石。購儲菜油五百二十担另菜餅一百八十餘祖，另購棉花一百五十六担。現在該會盈餘實物計米四萬八千餘石，鹽九萬三千餘担，食油五百餘担，共計現値金圓五億數千萬元。數字不可謂不鉅，然而在這一次浙省參議會一屆五次大會中，物運委代主委馮文啓氏備受省參議員的責難。而這一次責詢也爲最緊張熱烈的一次，他們說物運會是與民爭利，說是利用權力强制收購各縣積穀。但據馮委員說：「在絕對不與民爭利的原則下經營業務，物資運用委會沒有借用過權力，各縣積穀原有多餘而需出售者，故也不能說爲强制」。省參議員在激烈爭論後復有主張撤銷並淸算物運會者。後據記者所知，浙省新任主席周奉璋氏，以省庫支絀，物運會確能使浙省經費獲得周轉，所以無意撤銷。</p>
<p>增產？萎縮</p>
<p>如上所述，我們希望的物資運用委員會，不但把物資集中統制外銷，而是還須把物資加以改良，把外銷竄餘的一部投回到原來的生產事業上，使生產因着物運會的關係，能不斷的增加，而不致因着物運會的關係而萎縮。我人所知浙省物運會已經辦理的主要業務中，大別可得爲購儲糧食，購儲食油，購銷綠蔴與棉花。今天糧食問題誠爲一很重要的問題，儲糧應急，也是理所應得，不過在收購糧食時我們須有一理解，農村已達凋敝衰竭之境，縣中積穀的盈餘，本爲地方有力人士廉價收購者有之，現旣我們爲了整個浙省大衆業務而去收購，不妨與縣級商妥，卽較原縣中售出之價稍昂，而以高出之數，舉辦農村事業。食油亦然，我們收購菜籽，應提出若干數目之款作爲改良的經費，以菜籽榨油時，亦應提出若干數目作爲這一榨油工廠的改良費用。綠蔴，棉花亦是同樣的辦法。</p>
<p>赴產區調查</p>
<p>物運會應隨時派員，分赴產區訪問，關於農村生活與生產的改良增進，都應製成調查表格，以爲下一年度收購數量的張本，從而也可看出因爲物資的外銷運用，使物資不斷的增產，無形中增加了浙省的財富。以今日的浙江言，物運會現所購儲的物品，自爲極易生利的物品，物運會應更進一步謀浙江的特產如形將衰洛的絲綢，茶葉，桐油的外銷暢旺，則對浙江前途有更大的裨益。我們認爲浙省參會不應資備物運會爲與民爭利，而應詢問物運會運用物資後對地方的裨益究有若干？對物資的改良生產到底收穫到多小效果？而物運會方面，不應以一中間商之形式單就雙方買賣之成功，而應尋求這項物資外銷後，對外之印象如何？再如何督導產地改良，更能取獲銷地的信仰？</p>
<p>今後的業務</p>
<p>當然，物資運用委員會是含有公賣性質，統制運銷性質，惟其統制運銷與公賣爲公家所經營，自其盈餘能歸還於公。不過，我們在統制運銷時，如果忽略了積極性的改良產品，則統制運銷的前途也極黯淡。我們希望今後物運會的業務，應更進一步爭取浙省特產的向外暢銷。</p>
<p>西北的羊羣在尋覓牠們的綠洲　（本報攝）</p>
<h3>確保西北大門　一個軍士與人民間的爭吵　在新疆可能引起民族問題</h3>
<p>— 謝再善</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上年我率領着國立西北大學邊政入南疆各地，往返行程兩萬里，爲時四閱月。回來以後，好多朋友問我新疆情形以及此行觀感，限於時間，不能一一奉答，爰草是文，以就正於關心新疆問題的人士之前。</p>
<p>國防上的重要</p>
<p>新疆是我國最大的一省，其面積有一，六四一，五五四平方公里，約四倍於四川，八倍於湖南，十五倍於浙江，約有陝西，甘肅，寗夏，靑海，綏遠五省面積的總和。這廣大的一塊地方，可惜向不爲內地人士注意，大好河山，棄置塞上，無人理采！我們看：現在我們的邊疆地帶已成了什麼狀態？東北仍然紛亂，外蒙業已獨立，西藏若卽若離，新疆又是如何？我們業已見到新疆的西北角——伊犂，塔城，阿山三區已特殊化了。我們將如何以確保西北大門，這是當前每一偶中國人應有的課題。新疆鄰接中亞，向爲英俄窺伺之所，在國防上實爲重要。這樣說起來，我們不妨回顧歷史；自從漢武帝遣張騫使西域起，便是爲了增加國防力量而實行的一種外交策略，其目的在招烏孫，大月氐諸國內附，以斷匈奴右臂，結果西域內屬之國三十六，一時稱盛。東漢明帝時班超入西域，臣服五十餘國，此後屢絕屢通。唐時平定西突厥，就其地設置　縻州，州府多至數百，又設安西都護府（在今南疆）北庭都護府（在今北疆），駐有重兵，從事經營，漢唐盛世，莫不以西域爲國防重鎭，迄於淸代平定準噶爾後，於其地設都統，辦事大臣，參贊大臣，領隊大臣以統治之。迨左宗棠平回亂，始於光緒八年正式設省，視同內地，從此新礙才確屬中國地方，同時我國的西北國防也確實伸展到天山南北路了。</p>
<p>新疆在國防上的地位的重要，過去如此，現在更是重要，今負責新疆軍事當局，也認識很淸楚，他們很明白新疆是中國西北的大門，新疆有失，則嘉峪關外，盡非我有，而整個的西北亦將步入淪亡的恐怖。我們曾經聽到幾位負責軍事長官的談話，他們對於保衛國土的意志很堅强，都說新疆尺土寸地皆不能失。這是對的，我們對這樣重要的地方，當不能等閒視之。</p>
<p>新疆目前的情况如何呢？現在試分述如後：</p>
<p>政治的民主化</p>
<p>在政治上新疆是實施了政治民主化，全省的專員，縣長都是民選的，這在今日，內地還未能實行的民選地方行政官，在邊遠的新疆却早已實行了。那些民選的專員，縣長，也許在行政的技術上有些不熟練，辦事的效率也許有些不能達到標凖，可是這些由老百姓選舉出來的公僕，確實是在做事，不是在做官，沒有一點官僚習氣。任何一個縣長，都像平民一樣隨便和老百姓談話，上下並無隔閡。我們在南疆看到一個縣長在縣府的大門口和老百姓談天，其服裝，其態度，毫無官僚模樣。這使我們看慣了內地縣長之「君臨是邦」，對於縣民的作威作福的樣子，倒覺得奇怪了。卽此一例，可以知道新疆的政治是在向上進步。因爲縣長是民選，故各縣以維族縣長爲多，我們在南疆只遇到三個漢人縣長，但是他們的副縣長仍是維族。</p>
<p>省政的方向如何走，已經有了說明，我們在新疆曾聽到各方面的說法，他們所說雖異，立塲亦自不同，但是其結論已漸趨一致，新疆是有新疆的道路，不必與內地相同，</p>
<p>各民族的團結</p>
<p>新疆各民族漸趨團結。新疆的民族，在盛世才時代曾分之爲十四種，這種分法，今多目之爲不類，故又有分之爲突厥語系，蒙古語系，漢語系之說。此種以語言爲民族分類之標準，較爲科學，然因此突厥語系民族更加强大了，突厥語系系民族包括維五爾·哈薩克，塔塔爾·塔蘭其·塔吉克·柯爾　孜。烏孜別克等，佔全疆人口百分之八十。我們舊日有個傳統，就是願意把邊疆地帶的民族稱之與漢民族同出一源，是一個老祖宗，這在我國史書上有不斷的記載。其實，這是很勉强的，民族的結合並不是這樣簡單，不必强拉。新疆各族的存在是儼然的事實，固是我們不能否定新疆各種不是民族。天體說起來，新疆省內民族與民族之間並沒有什麼不可解決的矛盾，維族與漢族似乎是對立了。然而歷次新省所發生的事變，多是由於政治不良所引起的惡果。由於政治事變，轉爲民族鬥爭，又由民族鬥爭，引起外交糾紛，這好像是三部曲，結了不解之緣。現在新省當局已洞悉　結所在，故在這方面特下工夫，務使政治修明，民族團結。在內地一個軍人與人民爭吵，只是一件軍民不和而已，算不了什麽大事，可是在新疆，如果一個軍人與人民爭吵，卽可能引起民族問題。我們曾在喀什市街上看見一漢族軍官與一維族商人爭吵，那個軍官舉手打了那個維商，當時那個維商就當衆宣佈說：「這是什麼軍隊？漢人這樣壓迫維族嗎？」這就引出民族間的隔閡了。像這樣小事，積久成怨，遇機便會爆發出民族的怨憤。我們曾經舉行過各族靑年文化座談會，他們皆一致强調：新疆各族應加强團結，而團結之道則是要互相尊重其習俗宗敎，語言，生活等。這是順理成章之論，要各民族和平相處，也惟有如此。</p>
<p>人民生活頗好</p>
<p>目前新疆的人民生活尙稱安定，社會秩序旣好，生活水准亦較富裕。尤以南疆一帶，氣候溫和，農產甚豐，食糧無缺。這種豐裕景象，可由駐軍的給養上看出來。新疆北路駐軍的食糧是由甘肅運去，（爲减輕人民負祖，不惜千里運糧，）但南路駐軍的食糧，則由當地籌措，士兵的營養甚好，每餐有肉，這是內地的駐軍是不易得到的。我們遇到的國軍，他們都說在那裏吃的不錯，服裝也相當整齊。例如在拜城的駐軍一國，每個士兵皆有馬靴一雙，原來是他們自己的製革廠的出品。</p>
<p>北疆哈維兩族</p>
<p>北疆哈族爲游牧生活，牛羊遍遍野，無憂無慮，自由生息，生活悠閒。在天池，我們曾訪問過哈薩克之家，他們對於生活的態度是不虞匱乏的。瓜菓遍地，尤爲內地所少見。哈族維族同胞生活如此之好，漢族同胞亦復如是。漢族多居於城市，公務經商爲其恒業，因地方安定，生活不像內地日處於烽火中的同胞那樣貧窮，困苦，最低限度也可維持一個五口之家的溫飽。在北疆務農的漢族，以無歉荒，其生活也較內地農民爲優。城市農村，一片昇平氣象，想不到在我們這個遍地烽火的國家裏尙有如此安靜的地方。</p>
<p>富源埋在地下</p>
<p>新疆富源不在地面，而在地下，礦藏之富，據目前初步調查，煤，鐵，石油埋藏量，居全國各省第一位，這只是一個初步調查。未能發現的礦藏當然很多。我們看到焉耆附近的一大煤礦床，煤層露出地面，無人過問，庫車，喀什的石油取用不盡，當地人土法提煉應用，金礦的開採，隨時可聽到人說某處可採金，鐵礦則隨地可有，英吉莎，庫車，自古以產一刀出名，卽其地產鐵，並有極好的煉鋼手工業。在溫宿與拜城之間有一鹽山，東西百餘里，高二百公尺完全是一座鹽山，我們去參觀，看到這座鹽山，覺到新疆恒是寶藏無盡，在新疆建設化學工業，這不是很好的基礎嗎？這座鹽山之　，可以用之不竭的。新疆礦藏的豐　，說明了這塊地方是適於發展重工業的。我們期待着國家有辦法，趕緊來開發這塊「未開墾的處女地」，邊疆無恙，國防自安。</p>
<p>文化教育發展</p>
<p>新疆在安定環境中最適於發展文化敎育。內地的書報雜誌，在迪化亦可以看到，而西北文化建設協會，尤致力於新疆文化的建設工作，出版各種有關新疆的刋物。這一些近代文化的發展，固然値得贊揚，但是各民族固有的文化生活，尤足以令人驚嘆。維族同胞的能歌善舞，不分男女老幼都能表現他們的藝術天才，我們看到妙齡少女的歌舞，也看到八旬老翁的舞蹈，五歲的小兒，當他表演單人舞時，博得滿塲掌聲。</p>
<p>歌舞家的故鄉</p>
<p>我們在內地聞名的康巴拉漢小姐，在新疆並不是數一數二的天才歌舞家，在南疆，那是號稱歌舞家之鄕，每當「浪園子」的季節，（夏日萬子成熟，家家舉行遊園舞會，俗稱浪園子)，我們可以看到眞正菓國文化的色彩，那是優美的，快活的，表現出綠洲中生活的男女之樂趣。我們在溢宿曾經看到一個名叫帕夏漢小姐的歌舞，她才十六歲，在師範學校讀書。婀娜的舞姿，悠揚的歌聲，眞是一個天才的歌舞家。我們不是說維族的歌舞可看可聽而巳矣，我們更應當注意這歌舞是維族同胞的實生活的一部分，在他們的生活中，如果除掉歌舞，卽將是一件不可想像的事情。眞正的藝術是不能與現實脫離的，維族同胞的藝術生活才是眞正的生活。我們以爲在新疆應當盡力發揚各族的文化，輔之以敎育，則新疆的敎育文化事業當可蒸蒸日上。</p>
<p>治邊三大政策</p>
<p>在蘭州，張文白將軍曾經對我們說：解決新疆問題，首先要袪除過去對邊疆的偏見，如大漢主義，或同化政策。他曾詳細的分析過去邊疆政策的錯誤，並且指出了今後應走的路子。他的見解在今日的治邊上，不失爲上策，然而最後，他又慨嘆了，他說：「解決新疆問題目前有三個辦法：（一）積極建設，促進經濟·文化發展，使新疆同胞得以過着安適生活·（二）如不能建設，則任新疆同胞去自己決定其自己的命運，自治·獨立·任他選探（三）。以武力維獲邊境，加强國防·現在，這三條路一個也不能實行：頭一個，國家沒有錢，那能建設？第二個，我們不願把這大好土地隨便放棄。第三個，國家尙無此力量。那只有維持現狀，以待將來了！」張文白的結論是對的，我們拭目以觀將來罷。我們覺得，新疆這塊地方有待國人努力，其未來的命運，就得看我們的國運而有所決定。</p>

<h3>新方案實施細則通過後　金銀市場即可恢復　市塲組織可能仿照證交方式</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於金銀巿塲之開放問題，昨據某關係方面透露，整套辦法，尙在徐財長袋中。據稱，金銀巿塲之恢復，不過爲此次財金改革方案實施细則中之一部份。此次金銀市塲之開放，顯然與宋子文及貝祖詒時代之拋售黄金方式不同，而係將八一三後歇業迄今之金菜巿塲，重予恢復，俾金銀及銀元得有一正式而公開之交易巿塲。該市塲之組織，可能仿照目前證劵交易所之方式，參加巿塲交易之會員，必須爲認可而合格之行家，須繳定額之保證金，故巿塲之經營及管理權，將儘可能由民間負責。而財政當局，可能將仿目前證交之方式，派遣監理官駐塲監督。該關係方面强調稱：此一公開巿塲恢復後，一切金銀及銀元之交易，當能循有制度而合法之成規而活動。而國行當局，當亦能發揮其公開市塲之買賣政策，使金銀及銀元之行巿臻於穩定。預料全部實施細則經政院通過施行後，太市金業市塲，卽將着手籌備恢復云。</p>
<h3>米市上落陜隘　市况南疲北堅　食油雜糧一救疲掙</h3>
<p>食米昨南北二巿塲堅疲不一，南巿塲因銀根稍緊，人心甚疲，開價略低一二百元，白粳退做一萬九千四百元，薄稻一萬九千五百元，各降一百元，早稻降二百元爲一萬九千二百元，白元·陰元·仍站原價。北巿塲因產地價高，亦見稍挺，白粳漲二百元，早薄稻各漲二三百元，二巿塲到貨共計七千七百四十二石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>漲後見回，初巿繼昨日漲勢，北帮收進仍力，兵船一度升做八千六百五十元，老車最高九千一百五十元，後巿以圈外各物齊小，傳央行暗拋，貨主售意極濃，市勢遂吿不支，老車收市跌進九千關，兵船臨收八千四百元、麩皮跟挫一百元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>轉趨疲落，獨黄豆在開放出口禁令之傳說下，客帮重臨光顧，車豆一度升做萬八千元，後聞油餅轉平，回挫五百元，生仁初開疾退一成，後以客帮問津，黄豆挺堅，回升三千元，其他苞米紅雜芝蔴，在各物普降聲中，削落一成左右。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>盤旋略挫，初開因米價下降，遂亦跟跌二三千元，豆油開市七萬四千元，中市曾回高至七萬七千元，收市又因業外價格回低，故復回降，收市豆油七萬四千五百，軋低一千五百元，生菜油跌二千五百，吉桶生油平定，豆餅平疲，長字餅七千七百，利字餅七千五百，收市乏受主。</p>
<h3>油糧公會請求　開放油料南運</h3>
<p>關於食油及其原料禁止南運一案，前經明令廢止，後復奉令再予禁運一月，限期現又屆滿。雜糧公會及油公會以華南各地所需之食油及原料，本多仰賴滬市供應，自經數月來之禁運以後，不僅會員業務頗受影響，而對華南各地之紛請接濟一點，尤感到有心有餘而法不容之憾，茲因限期屆滿，該會等於今日會銜呈請市府，咨轉江海關迅予恢復南運，以暢貨流而利工商。</p>
<h3>銀根穩中帶俏</h3>
<p>昨日本巿銀根，走勢穩中帶俏。市塲拆息，在日拆七十元至八十元間。頭寸需求，仍甚冗盛，而供源則亦稱旺。因目前巿拆過高，頗多貨帮，願脫貨放息，業內行莊外供亦多。</p>
<h3>行局昨貫差出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨續差出六三六〇〇萬元，大交換各行差入五九〇四〇元，洋商各行差入五六二八八萬元，小交換各行差出四七五九二元。</p>
<h3>國營事業股票　均將陸續上市</h3>
<p>繼台糖公司股票與卅八年黄金公債之後，紡建公司與招商局等國營事業股票，不久亦將上巿買賣。據負責當局昨向記者談稱，自台糖公司股票在證交上市買賣以來，成績頗爲良好。當局爲加强吸收遊資起見，對紡建公司與招商局股票上市手續，現正加緊籌備中。各項工作已漸具體化，短期內可望實現。卅八年黄金短期公債，業已於昨日上市開拍。又卅六年金公債，不久亦將上市買賣。由於政府證劵絡續上市買賣，使政府又增加一吸收遊資之途徑。今後拋售證券工作，將與配售其他物資工作，同時幷進，配合進行，</p>
<h3>行莊申請動用資金　金管局又核准二家</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行莊申請動用增資現金案件，金管局續收到四十餘件。昨日上午十一時，該局曾與國行業務局稽核處舉行第十七次例會逐一審核，除新核准動用資金行莊二家，金額卅萬元外，其餘均爲申請轉期案件。</p>

<h3>本年對日貿易物資　中信列單呈審核</h3>
<p>據中央信託局消息，自財政金融改革方案公布後，政府爲謀配合此新方案，促進發展國際貿易起見，刻已在擬定一新對日貿易計劃，以首先擴大推展對日貿易。中信局方面現巳將本年度以內，我國可運往日本交換之物資類別，及我國需日本運來我國之物資類別，列單呈請工商部在審核中。一俟工商部核准後，卽可開始推進。惟目前在政府之計劃未決定前，一切業務均無重大展開云。</p>
<h3>桐油劇升</h3>
<p>桐油昨巿，因外匯移轉證瘋狂疾晋，頻頻激動人心，買氣凌霄，賣戶趁機力抬，趨勢愈益鋒芒。價格方面雖在業外物品盤平中，而桐油行市，一再踊騰，別樹新幟。</p>
<h3>金債初次登塲　華股定勢疲滯</h3>
<p>黄金公債昨日登塲，按照規定，開價爲十五萬五千元，高價爲十七萬元，低價爲十五萬元，計有二萬元起落幅度，上午收盤價仍爲十五萬五千元。其賣方爲銀行帮居多，買方以廣帮較巨，成交共爲六百廿八兩。股票因時値星五，買方須負荷二天日息，全程因環象平澄，新買顧慮高息，徜徉躊躇，莫敢放手，市態常呈萎縮盤伏之象。各股因亦少變，升降數亦較上日爲少。近收聞銀根未緊，浮賣動補，曾又回堅，結果皆以平滯穩定收市。新亞一度先吿漲停，振漆仍在漲限收市，計升數爲一分至三角五分，永業升四元，又計回降者十四種。台糖中途突報跌限，爲其連漲十一次之反響，計獨降五二〇元。他股亦各小一分半至一角。半日成交共達三九億五千一百萬設，內永紗一億一千二百五十萬股。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>黄金公債交易每日下午二點至三點照做，星六下午停市。半日成交二百八十一兩，高價爲十六萬一千元，低價爲十五萬七千元，收盤爲十五萬九千四百元。賣方仍爲銀行帮，買方爲同業居多云。</p>
<h3>外股回疲</h3>
<p>外股市勢，止堅轉疲。昨日圈中銀根頗緊，大戶反進爲退，散戶跟進，行情較上日小半成光景。計怡紗做七千二百元，較上日軋小三百元。英聯亦見不振，做七千七百元。會德豐無做開，亞洲航業做七百元，七百二十元，較上日軋跌一百元餘各股均軋挫半成光景。</p>
<h3>台灣煤礦產量　今年可彎增加</h3>
<p>據與台灣煤礦業同業公會有關係之來客談，去年台機煤礦生產因受風災水災一再侵襲，產量僅達一百七十萬噸，本年估計可增至二百萬噸以上。如能加添各種機械及礦工人數，產量尙可增加。目前台灣煤斤出口，仍受政府統制，而對外每年配額，上海達五萬餘噸，廣州一萬三千噸，厦門千餘噸，福州二千噸，此數較各地實際需要情形則尙不足。有待設法增加，以期增進台灣與內地之貿易。至於香港方面過去並無配額，據聞同業公會方面希望以台燒杯交換香港開發煤礦之機械，或其他台機所需物資，現正派員接洽中。</p>
<p>煤價又漲</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕四礦聯營處之基隆煤價，昨因台幣價格調整，亦吿漲價，新價每噸六五九二〇元，較舊價漲三六七〇元。其他外國烟煤仍屬無貨無市，白煤塊納十等均維原價。</p>
<h3>茶市趨勢激昂</h3>
<p>自本市物價掀起連綿漲風後，昨巿一般心思，大都居高思危，故態度不若往昔之倔强，漲風頓形戢止。而茶葉市况，並不稍受束縛，反一致登峯造極，緣因執戶感於成本激昂，同時繼承隔日雖漲未足之潛伏力，開後卽圖蠢動，喊價徐步向前。以迄收市，軋升不少，疲頹多日之交易，則在吐納談判相持中，依然未轉絢爛。</p>
<h3>食糖盤旋</h3>
<p>食總昨日市况先高後回，午收時微見上楊。45號車白精三七五〇〇元，再升五〇〇元，粗砂三六七〇〇元，亦升七〇〇元。興化白赤刁靑等均微升五百至七百元左右。其餘各檔業內連日納胃過量，巳呈飽和，惟因拆息過高，執戶板持，交易在軟檔中，均做平盤。與前日午收無甚榮辱。</p>
<h3>市塲散步　看台客</h3>
<p>美英間金融激化中　南非英國大吃美國的豆腐</p>
<p>國際貨幣基金會，規定世界純金價每盎司卅五美元。但簽字國南非聯邦，最近特製成色稍差之金，以金製品爲理由，照卅八美元半出售。南非的宗主國是英國，故南非此舉，出諸英國策動。</p>
<p>國際貨幣基金會的台柱，是美國。基金會竭力反對南非此舉，顯係美國的策動。</p>
<p>對德勝利後，英美間在貨幣及貿易上的明爭暗鬥，與日俱爭。這次鬥爭，不過是許許多多明爭暗鬥中的一種演出。</p>
<p>過去歷次爭鬥，有時美國勝利，有時英國勝利。</p>
<p>譬如，勝利之初，英國向美國要借金匯，美國打了七折八扣，並且發展爲馬歇爾援歐計劃，才借與英國，這是美國勝利。</p>
<p>美國借錢給英國及歐洲其他各國時，希望各國貨幣照黑市匯率，重行訂定官價。因爲各國官價都比黑市高，美國此種條件，旨在迫使各國貶値，動搖各國幣信，更增大美國金元外交的控制力量。英國堅決反對，美國只好放棄這條件，這是英國勝利。　這次，南非高價售金，英美間的金融戰，又展開了。後果雖未可遽爾逆料，但不久將來，世界金價及國際匯市，必將激成重要變動，大勢已因此事而確定了。　本來，英國擁有世界最大之金鑛，美國擁有世界最多之存金。英國多的是期貨，美國多的是現貨。英國等於遠水不救近火，所以窮極。美國能現貨現交，才能發揮其金元外交的威力。此次英國策動南非高價售金，旨在加緊採金，解目前之渴。美國反對南非，旨在確保自己的金元外交實力。</p>
<p>南非高價售金，無形抑低了美元價値，因爲世界金價用美元計算的。過去，美國强制英鎊跌價，英國不肯。現在，英國打擊美元價値，美國自然也要拼力反對。</p>
<p>但是，儘管美國及基金會如何反對，南非有南非的理由，因爲卅五美元係每盎司純金價，南非售價是成色不同的金貨，因此不承認違約。</p>
<p>其實，純金價卅五美元；攙雜金價反要卅八美元半，南非的理由，等於吃豆腐。美國和基金會，都被吃了豆腐。</p>
<h3>棉紗先平後堅　布市趨勢平穩</h3>
<p>棉紗昨初平繼堅，粵帮零星交易尙不寂寞，執戶大多仍主樂觀，買意淡懈依然，但本街抱觀望者居多，尤以銀根仍緊，買方有所顧忌，結果徵吿挺升。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳初以一百十七萬元開出後，曾高見一百二十五萬元，終爲一百二十四萬元軋升六萬元。四〇支藍鳳挺五萬元，以一百二十一萬結束。三二支銀月晨開八十五萬元，最後升至九十萬元站住，終漲四萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨，自六十七萬元一路盤至七十二萬元，午收七十萬〇五千元，較前漲起二萬五千元。廠單現出最後做六十七萬元，二〇支雙馬六十五萬五千元，亦高二萬五千元。其餘金城及天女等皆露秀色，一六支光明破六十萬元大關，至六十萬〇五千元收市，軋漲一萬五千元，其他各市俱屬堅穩。</p>
<p>布市呈盤旋局面，良以自隔日登峯造極後，新買終因價昂，態度咸懷猶豫，但大戶鑒於南運開放，不願輕易脫手，故各檔行情均稱平穩。</p>
<p>龍頭細在晨初與上日午後塲外喊價無異，以三萬〇七百五十元開出，嗣以一般散戶臨高思危，逢高吐售，終以勢難力敵，乃棄三萬元大關，一路盤小至二萬八千八百元站住，較前挫一千元。喇叭童細布微降四百元，以二萬七千五百元結束。</p>
<p>此外Ｂ龍頭與五福細布亦陷低檔，四君子元嗶嘰由二萬九千一百元開出後，曾晋至二萬九千三百元，最後盤小至二萬七千二百元，軋跌一千元。金蓮紗舞元　嘰降五百元，餘布大多未動，午後因業內銀根轉鬆，塲外喊價復高至隔日午收之行情。</p>
<h3>中紡售紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售紗，共開九種，計售四十八件，准購者共二七戶，價値五三三二萬元。</p>
<p>各支紗售價，八支日光卅四萬元，十四支水月五六萬元，卅二支日光八五萬元，卅二支雙股豐年一一〇萬元，四〇支社寶光一一二萬元，四二支雙股及四〇支三股紅寶光均一一五萬元，六〇支宮女一七〇萬元，八〇支雙股ＴＫ彩球三六五萬元。</p>
<h3>木材堅穩</h3>
<p>木材市况，杉木因來源减少，市價堅穩，惟洋貨漲勢仍落後，現杉木每尺一百二十元，洋松每尺三百元，柳安夾板每塊一千九百元。</p>
<h3>絲綢平盤</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况轉盤，業外紗布平庸，金鈔巿勢先高後盤，人心頗靜。市上銀根昨“稍鬆，但市息仍在七十。七十五之間，執貨負息，浮多頗具戒心。因之市况平庸，一二〇天橋晨開當日頭寸九三萬九四萬元。中間脫意甚濃，一度低回，嗣後聞金價軟後再堅，業外游資侵入，買氣轉旺，臨收叩百萬關了結。午後銀根轉鬆，圈外金價帶息略升，巿勢尙穩，惟一般物價連日銳漲，昨日各業趨勢均疲，大絲亦未能例外，故喊價微見上揚。</p>
<p>生絲昨市交易沉寂，大戶多抱觀望，銀根雖弛，暗息未低，故納胃至淡。優級先做一二〇萬後做一二二萬較昨午後回跌三萬元，Ｄ級一二五萬亦小三萬元，其餘各級趨勢平盤，午後業外各物無甚波動，金鈔市况亦帶息微升，巿况仍平，Ｄ級賊一二七萬八萬，優級喊一二三萬四萬元。</p>
<p>綢縀，被面開盤時走勢尙平，廠方未見開貨，巿上多爲套利交易。美亞初做六七五〇〇〇元，開後因拆息仍高，浮散戶均多了售。市勢一度回軟，低至六三萬·六四萬有供。嗣後圈外金價低後回升，但終盤旋於一九一〇〇〇元一九三〇〇〇元之間，市勢難望好轉，業內人心亦多觀望，瀕午以六四五〇〇〇元結束，軋小二萬餘元。</p>
<h3>美援棉交換率　聯營處初步決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美援棉花委員會，美援化紗布聯營處昨下午再度舉行聯席會議，對第三期美援棉花交換比率，經技術小組會報吿該組研究交換比率經過，根據各方面推算成本，對廿支標準紗一件，易棉磅數有定爲六二一，六二四·五，六三二及六四三磅等方式多種，當經再付鄭重討論，大致決定爲六二四·五磅，容再交由技術小組會於今晨椱計後核定</p>
<h3>市工業發表　上海硫酸工業概況</h3>
<p>硫酸爲最重要之基本工業，其消耗量足以反映整個工業之盛衰，且對於農業國防，亦具密切之關係。電要肥料，如硫酸錏過磷酸鈣及國防上之炸藥，均需互量之硫酸。其他如機器染織棉紡內衣針織硫化元搪瓷製革造紙銅料毛巾被單整理漂染毛紡等工業，均須多量之硫酸。香料染料儀器文具汽燈照相製版五金硫酸鎳鉻酸拋光油膠木駱駝絨製藥等所需硫酸較少，每月統計約需一千噸之譜。至於以硫酸爲原料製造鹽酸者，每月需要量不定。最多時可達四百噸，刻下因工業不景氣，故所需硫酸量總數當在六百噸以下。目前上海計有新業。中華·天工·江蘇等四家硫酸製造廠。新業應用設備最新之接觸法，成績甚佳。天工爲自行設計之接觸機械，頗爲難得。江蘇藥水廠係屬外商，採用鉛室法，較爲陳舊。中華雖爲鉛室法，然產量較多。上列四廠，去年全年之生產量如下：</p>
<p>中華三六〇〇噸（最大生產量爲五四〇〇噸）。</p>
<p>江蘇一三六〇噸（最大生產量二三七六噸）。</p>
<p>天工七二〇噸（最大生產量八三六噸）。</p>
<p>新業一五三〇噸（最大生產量四〇三二噸）。</p>
<p>以上四廠，現在產量，每年總計七二一〇噸，每月約六百噸。最大生產量一二六三八噸，每月約一千噸，足敷本巿各業目前之需要。</p>
<p>製造硫酸之原料，有硫鐵礦及硫黄二種。硫鐵礦國內產量頗豐，但因產地不靖，運輸困難，不能如預期之暢達。國產硫黄，以台灣爲量著，但品質欠佳，數量亦少，必需仰仗舶來品之供給。本巿硫酸廠新業及天工純用硫黄，中華江蘇兼用硫鐵礦。</p>
<p>硫酸之最大用途，爲製造硫酸錏及過磷酸鈣等肥料。國內各肥料廠，如合灣肥料公司·永利硫酸錏廠。善後事業鄕村第一示範工廠。均以生產之硫酸直接製造肥料。有時以餘剩硫酸，運銷本市，以供各工業之用。按國內硫酸廠數十家，以葫蘆島之資委會硫酸廠規模最大，設備亦新，每月可出一千五百噸。但因戰事影饗，暫時停工。台灣肥料公司之硫酸廠，規模雖大，但設備較舊，每月可出濃硫酸三五〇噸，淡硫酸三〇〇噸。但因容器問題未解決，不能盡量運滬，爲憾事耳</p>

<h3>馬華羽毛球隊　英報盛加讚譽</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦四日電〕「格拉斯哥前驅報」二日載有體育記者一文，檢討馬來亞羽球隊在湯麥斯杯賽中之戰蹟；關於對丹麥之決賽，文中有云：「頗驕矜自負之丹麥隊主將史加洛普，卽上年全英單打錦標，第一次敗化後，卽一蹶不振，榮贗國際羽毛球錦標隊之馬來亞勝來易如」。關於對美國隊之複賽則謂「最傑出特色爲費禮門與洛夫台之演出，曼台茲在黃炳順及黃德福手下之兩次光榮敗績，以及馬來亞最佳雙打曾官良與楊德才之高超球藝有六千人在塲目睹之馬美劇戰在羽球史上將列於最偉大比賽之林」。</p>

<h3>星洲足球界激發　僞裝的業餘</h3>
<p>〔美聯社〕架坡訊〕這裏近來發現了體育界裏一種頗不陌生的病態，已把整個星架坡的足球壇砧搖動了，在這裏，人喚牠作「偽裝的業餘」。</p>
<p>最近有一個熱中體育之人，曾用「開放門」的筆名，向海峽太晤士西報投函，指出在足球界中現有的病態，令人聽了會如身觸電流的事實，是得要用一次開刀的手法，去洗刷凈盡纔對的，他說：（「偽裝的業餘」是確有一其事，而爲此間的足球員和足球會職員所深知素識的），此外他還說出足球界現有的四種汚點，以證明星洲足球界，確已如被病菌侵入者。</p>
<p>（一）一個球員創傷了肌肉，他便請按摩者爲他按摩，實際的按摩費是每次坡幣二元，按了五次好了，可是那人所開的單，是一共按　十次，每次坡幣三元，於是他便有了坡幣廿元的利路，（每一坡幣照伸美金四如七仙半，）</p>
<p>（二）一個球員自謂內部受傷，於是請鐵打「先生」調理，每次五元，但開單時，他會向他的母會開單二十元。</p>
<p>（三）在大賽之前，一個明星球員，便有「交錢　，不則請你面對事實」的表示，會中的職員，因要他儘量作他最好的演出，便得予以豐富的招待，以求他的感情的融洽），俾在賽時，那負必有好的演出。</p>
<p>（四）明星球員要有明星的職位，實際上，各會都在暗鬥，看誰能予較佳的球員，以較好的職位。</p>
<p>海峽太普士報的主筆，對這種指摘，曾作以下的答覆：</p>
<p>在星洲足球界現有的流行症上言，我們對投函者深表同情，但我們還大可以多說出幾種證據，其中之一種，也視爲最懷的一種，便是上屆曾問某某數球員，送與「留會費」的事實，</p>

<h3>滬警車輪大戰　空高初戰失利　客車塲地生疏投籃失機甚多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕首都空軍高射砲第一團籃球隊，昨晚與滬警對抗於市體育館，爲該隊來滬第一戰，武裝同志捧塲者甚爲熱烈，滬警以快動作得勝，結果四四比三三。上半時廿五比十七。滬警輕車熟道，一路上風，空高表演尙不惡，惟有時過份注意姿勢，動作聯絡均須改進，投籃失機甚多，大約塲地生疏之故。該隊昨晚祗六人臨塲，亦相當吃虧。回觀滬警此戰彼休，人材衆多，採用車輸戰略，愈顯精神，戰前尙有友誼賽健樂對警機一塲，健樂卅八比卅五勝。</p>
<p>空高出塲者爲凌鏡寰，陳朝柱，何榮祿，楊百九，李立錦五人。滬警爲王蓉生，史久全，傅其俠，王伯文，　永標。開賽後，滬警先聲奪人，永標一球，伯文二罰，久全增色，六比零空高急呼暫停。凌鏡寰方揚手中籃，不料滬警又添三分，朝柱罰中，伯文兩側遠投，易如反堂。五比十八時，空高黃建國替百九出，滬警陳愼思孫摩西替蓉生久全，忽見空高聲勢一振，建國朝柱前後乘虛進逼，形勢好轉。上半時滬警廿五，空高十七。</p>
<p>滬警下半時不敢放鬆，久全破網，客將李玉錦報以顏色，陳朝柱又來一球。永標蓉生投桃報李，各獲二球，卅五比廿一，愈佔上風。空高斯際會有不少投籃機會，但因欲求姿勢好看，未能得手，滬警摩西代伯文，對方百九替建國，空高撑持殘局，勉爲其難，結果四四比肝三，客軍首戰失利，</p>

<h3>喬路易自傅（二）</h3>
<p>— 蒼龍譯</p>
<p>可是當我寄父帶我到底特律地方念書的時候，情形就不同了，我的成績還過不了第六等，而我却是班上很大的學生。可是，散課後，我在一輛運冰卡車上兼差，一天可以賺一塊錢。我常搶了五十磅至七十五磅的冰塊，送上好幾層高樓，對這些吃重的工作，我從不關心。我想這對我的拳擊是有幫助的，而且使我發育成長。而賺來的錢就交給家裏。入晚，我常在大街的一角和一羣地頭蛇鬼混。我們常時打架，但打得並不很厲害。</p>
<p>我因爲成績不好，掉了學校，但新校的一個敎員，一看就看出，與其改造我的頭腦，倒不如改造我的雙手。這話一點也不錯，我學做了木匠的工作。做得一手好傢具，從小桌子，書架以至什物櫃之類。家裏正缺少這些傢具，我就把它們帶回家用。不幸，那時美國經濟開始不景氣，使我繼父失業了。我母親祗得到救濟機關去，排在長長的隊伍裏，每週爲我們領些救濟費。這些錢我都記下帳來，一共是二百七十元，之後，我在一九三四年擊敗却利麥塞拉（Charlie　Massera）一戰中，贏得了一千三百元，就一次拔還了那筆二百七十三元的救濟費！</p>
<p>十六歲時，我對拳擊開始感到興趣。在學校裏的健身房中，我跟其他的同學一樣的帶上了手套·當時我曾想過，將來我也許會因此道而成名。每晚，我和同學們瀋談起那些拳擊手收入的富裕。有一位比我高一二班的同學麥金奈吿訴我，我如能參與業餘拳擊戰，每塲也可得到商品支票七元到廿五元。麥本人就是密契根的業餘輕量級的冠軍。</p>
<p>當時我還正在學習小提琴，可是上了五六課後，我就開始賴學。我把上課的費用去繳付業餘拳擊費用。最後這事終被我的小提琴敎師揭穿，我對母親說：我要做一個拳擊手，並不想做提琴家。我母親也不堅持，她常說，假使我的子女中有誰要在這世界上做一份事業，她將儘量工作，來看我們達成目的。不久，我在福特汽車工廠，找到了一份差使。</p>
<p>一九三二年前後，我第一次在業餘拳擊的塲面中出現。那時我體重一百六十八磅，他們要我跟一個白種孩子呌麥勒的對壘。麥勒曾出席世運，經驗宏豐，在兩個回合中，把我擊倒了七次之多。這是我拳擊生涯上被人擊倒次數最多的一趟。那晚　在床上，週身酸痛，意志消沉。但我仍得到了七元支票，我全部交給母親。</p>
<p>這一階段的經過眞够棘手，但我天天有進步。在我二年的業餘拳賽中，紀錄脾上我四十三次是以擊倒對手稱勝，七次積點評判獲勝，可是也職了四塲。這一階段我的對手，都是第二流的次貨。我手上紮的繃帶，經過了好幾塲惡戰，還是用了再用，因爲我實在沒有錢買新的。我也沒有拳擊時應穿的鞋子，祗得以舊的網球鞋暫且充用。還有，我吃的也不好，我家跟牛排猪排等無緣，而這些東西，却正是一個重量拳擊手所不可或缺，但價錢實在太貴了。頂多我祗能享受享受我所喜歡的香腸</p>
<p>一九三四年我奪得了底特律的輕量級冠軍。有一位對黑人拳擊手很感興趣的洛士盤開始注意到我，他對我說：如果我能下苦工練習，生活嚴肅，他將帮我一手。於是我就跟他學習。他把我帶到他家住，早起早睡，待我很好，給我許多衣服穿，跟他一塊吃飯，又常時週濟我，每星期有五六塊錢給我。他給我買了拳擊穿的鞋子，使我處處感到舒服，所以我在之後的拳擊賽中，都接連的以學倒稱霸。</p>
<p>我最後一次的業餘拳擊賽，是一九三四年六月十二日在底特律和鮑喬對壘的一塲。那次我上塲第一回合中，就把鮑解決了。這次以後，我就問洛士盤，我是否可轉入職業賽。他帶我到支加哥，替我介紹了白來克盤，白在我其後的八年拳擊賽中，每塲都作我的敎練。我所懂得有關拳擊的一切，幾乎都是他敎的。（未完）</p>

<h3>關元·銀圓·金圓</h3>
<p>— 草之</p>
<p>水電煤氣電車等公用事業新價，從三月起要照什麽「關元」計算收費了。</p>
<p>「關元」還是個新名詞，老百姓不大聽說，還以爲是從前的「關金」，只値法幣二十元呢。然而不然，這個關元來頭頗大，原來値美金四角！那麽，說得明白一點，就是公用事業要照美金折合金圓券收費罷了。</p>
<p>所以要如此者，據說是爲了要「避免金圓券貶値之影響」。話當然很對，但却苦了沒有關元只有金圓劵的公敎人負了。</p>
<p>經濟改革之際（是指這次，記不得該算是第幾次了），原聽說公敎人員要以銀圓發薪，不免使餓得面色早已發靑的公敎人員，做夢也夢到了河南路口可叮噹噹，銀光閃閃的袁大頭。但不料日復一日，這話似乎又不提了，拿到的不是「銀」圓，而仍然是「金」圓——可惜底下拖個「券」字。</p>
<p>水是不能不喝的；電燈也不能不點。電車，則爲了要吃飯，也不得不坐。然而錢呢，却要「照關元計算」。手裏傘着幾張天天在貶値的金圓劵，要到月底去付那硬不肯貶値的關元，我們的公敎人員，總要去跟什麼魔術大家學學才好呀！</p>
<p>走筆至此，又見四日報載，謂金管局負責人對記者談稱，本市有少數商店，竟以銀元標價，出售貨品。如此，「不僅有强迫顧客以銀元爲收付之嫌，且足妨碍幣制，擾亂金融，應予從嚴取締」云云。</p>
<p>對極對極！不過，公用事業呢？不是堂而皇之的經過核准，而要以什麼關元標價，出售其「貨品」了麽？以銀元標價的不過是「少數商店」，以關元標價的却是全部公用事業！難道這，還不算是「妨碍幣制，擾亂金融」，還不應該「從嚴取締」麽？</p>
<p>而且銀洋，不管是大頭，小頭，龍洋，船洋，總還是中國人用過的中國洋鈿；而什麼「關元」，却是四角外國洋錢。這個，豈不是更加「妨碍幣制，擾亂金融」，豈不是更加應該「從嚴取締」麽！</p>
<h3>拉角</h3>
<p>— 南無</p>
<p>議曾拉角之風，雖說於今爲烈，却也古已有之，三十幾年前就曾經熱鬧過一塲的了，好在大家都還記得，這裏不必細表，以免敬。</p>
<p>却說外國也是這樣的。一九三四年五月，美國參院開會，討論一件相當重要的「破產法案」，其時有一位貪名藉藉的議員，名叫灰狼，綽號「靑魚」，此公一見議案與己不利，就聯合了一個叫做茀來然的議員，儘量反對，可是儘管他們說得天花亂墜，倒底難逃公道，陣陣慘敗，眼見得要表決通過了。</p>
<p>這時灰狼情急智生，等到要表決的時候，却滔滔不絕地辯論起來。美國議會的主席是不能制止發言的，灰狼的目的本來祇要拖延時間，因此便信口開河，天南地北的亂談一陣，一立起來就連講了三個鐘頭。別的議員曉得他是存心搗蛋，誰也懶得聽他胡說八道，不禁紛紛「抽籤」，悄悄溜掉，片刻之間，議塲中只有灰狼還在高談闊論，旁邊祗有一個他的同黨茀來然還坐着恭聽宏論，此外就只有一個主席吉勃生了。</p>
<p>這時，灰狼突然下了一着狠棋，他說：「好，祗有我們幾個了嗎？我們來表決本案吧」！</p>
<p>議長吉勃生急得六神無主，可是依據美國議事規則，主席又不能建議檢查出席人數，眼見得灰狼竟可以功成垂敗了。</p>
<p>不想那時大門口突然號衝進了一個名叫白區門的議員，後面有一個人正對着白區門呌着：「快，快！快要求檢查出席人數是否足額」！</p>
<p>白區門照樣一建議，吉勃生自然喜出望外，灰狼却大失所望了。他氣得七竅生烟，對白區門身後的那個人說道：「好，咱們慢慢算賬」！</p>
<p>白區門身後的人是誰呢？他就是美國議會的第一名紅人，秘餮長皮甫爾，也就是杜魯門最規信的一個知己。此公以善於拉角造福民衆，不能不說是使使者流，亦「月亮是外國好」之一例也。</p>
<h3>袁世凱和他的「大頭」</h3>
<p>— 素貝</p>
<p>「袁大頭」榮獲「銀元冠軍」，據說確是因爲含銀量足，成色好。筆者沒有化驗過袁頭，不敢輕率捧塲；但有三項事實，足證大頭成色道地的說法，大致不差：</p>
<p>（一）據中央造幣廠方面說，各種銀元中以大頭成色最佳；</p>
<p>（二）中共人民銀行所規定的銀元兌換價，以袁頭索價最高；</p>
<p>（三）近數月來頗有人對袁頭身價深表懷疑，而專事收購鷹洋及小頭，但大頭未曾因而稍衰。</p>
<p>果爾，則袁世凱其人，雖然已是民國史上的陳腐渣滓，而袁世凱其頭，則正以成色道地，聲望日增，其深得人心，正是地無分「南北」，人無論「左右」。今日政府所大量趕造的「船洋」，勢將屈居「袁洋」之下。袁世凱身名敗裂已卅年，想不到卅年後竟以他所主鑄的銀元成色道地，而發生了「百齡機」的效刀。「袁逆」地下有靈，殆將暗暗稱喜，揚眉吐氣一番；但我們從整個政治經濟史上面看，則難免有「一代不如一代」之感。縱然，袁世凱的逆蹟昭彰，早經蓋棺論定，但「袁幣」不偸工，不减料，却在今天深受老百姓的歡迎。</p>
<p>至少，在鑄行銀幣方面，袁世凱並沒有取巧「偷鷄」，揩老百姓的油。荒唐如袁世凱者，竟也頗知遺愛於民的道理呢、</p>

<h3>讀公展先生同志爲災法會而作之「由和平說到佛教暖流戒殺」　文後感賦</h3>

<h3>上海舊話之一　跑馬廳三遷記</h3>
<p>— 古齊</p>
<p>靜安寺路馬霍路上的跑馬廳，寬廣數百畝，如果從國際飯店棋上俯視，但見綠草如茵，一望無際，在商萊繁盛的中心之區，留着這麼一片空地，不能利用，實在是可惜。以前參擊會開會時，聞也曾提及出價收回，或以郊區地皮互換，而將原址改爲公共集會及運動塲所，終因這筆錢開出來其數嚇人而罷。</p>
<p>跑馬廳是外僑組織的，有董事會，成立於一八五〇年。但那時的跑馬廳，並不在現在的地方，而是在今南京路河南路轉角處，廣六十畝，作爲賽馬賽球之用，一般人都稱之爲「老公園」。到一八五四年，商業漸漸發展，這一帶的地價迅速高漲，董事會見有利可岡，就把這塊地皮賣了，另在今浙江路西藏路之間購了一塊地皮，作賽馬之用，一般人就稱它爲「新公園」。後來，逍一帶的地價也跟着高漲了，就又賣出而把賽馬塲再向西移，那就是現在的跑馬廳了。這是一八六二年的事。因爲兩次買進賣出，獲利頗多，所以這最後一次購進的地皮，也較前兩次爲大得多。</p>
<p>黃夢畹所作「雜著」一書中，對於當時的跑馬廳，也有一段記載。他說：「寓滬西商，每歲春秋二季，有跑馬之戯，關廣塲於大馬路西首，周圍十餘里，圍以欄杆，植以砂土，細草芉綿，一望無際。至日，立勒齊銜錦轉一色，海螺響起，駿足如飛，自三四馬至十餘馬不等，每次必跑三日。跑畢又有跳花旗架諸戲，觀者幾如恒河沙數，而敎坊姊妹，無不高駕馬車，逐隊而至，遊客之似曾相識者，耳鬢厮廣，亦所不禁，誠冶遊之勝事也。」由此，也可想見當時盛况如何了。</p>

        <h1>1949.03.05</h1>
<h3>Considering the CCP's Eight Conditions: Government Discusses and Drafts Peace Proposal; Ten-Member Committee's Drafting Work Awaits</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The ten-member committee designated by Acting President Li, including Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Qun, to study peace proposals has been exchanging opinions separately in recent days, but has not yet entered the drafting stage. Part of the content of the peace proposal is based on studying the eight conditions proposed by the CCP and putting forward counter-proposals. It is understood that the most difficult issues to resolve are "war criminals" and "army reorganization." The issue of "abolishing traitorous treaties" will be easier to resolve, as both sides can abolish any treaty deemed to have compromised sovereignty. Two members of the ten-member committee have left Nanjing, so the work of drafting a proposal has not reached the final stage. The Executive Yuan's discussion meeting on the 4th also touched on the peace issue, expressing determination and sincerity for peace and committing to remove obstacles to peace with all efforts. According to the Nanjing Evening News on the 4th, the government's peace negotiation representatives have been re-appointed as Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhong Tianxin, and Wu Zhongxin, but this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The government's ten-member special committee responsible for drafting a peace plan has reached an agreement on counter-proposals to the first four of Mao Zedong's eight conditions and is continuing to meet to determine the government's response to the other four conditions. The counter-proposals for the first four are: (1) The CCP must make concessions on "punishing war criminals"; (2) The constitution can be amended; (3) The National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan can be dissolved; (4) Reorganize the armies of both sides on the principle of equality.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] People here generally believe that the main problem for peace in China is only to find an appropriate formula for "saving face." Politically, everyone acknowledges that China's civil war is over. Observers believe that the main obstacle to finding a solution is the extremist elements within both sides. Before acceptable answers are obtained to the thorny issues of punishing war criminals and reorganizing the army, there may still be bloodshed. It is heard that the central authorities are quietly urging former President Chiang to go abroad, and military forces are gradually being reduced under the guise of financial difficulties. Most Kuomintang members expect that the Communist Party will gain a controlling position in the future coalition government, but they still hope to gain a balanced control in the administrative organs of the provinces under the Kuomintang government. Therefore, the government is busy reorganizing personnel in various provinces to maintain higher administrative efficiency, while also transferring greater power to local authorities. Regardless of the content of the final agreement, it is believed that it will be accepted by most areas controlled by the government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Zhang Zhizhong and Wu Zhongxin, two members of the ten-member committee designated by Acting President Li to draft a peace plan, flew to Xikou yesterday to visit President Chiang, requesting that full power be transferred to Acting President Li and asking to go abroad for recuperation.</p>
<h3>Future Executive Yuan Meetings To Be Held in Nanjing or Guangzhou Depending on Actual Needs and Number of Attendees</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The 46th Executive Yuan political affairs meeting decided to hold the meeting at 9:00 AM on the 5th in the Presidential Office. This decision was agreed upon and supported by the political affairs committee members at the Executive Yuan's discussion meeting on the 4th. It was also decided that future Executive Yuan meetings should be held in Nanjing or Guangzhou at any time, depending on actual needs and the number of attendees. The Executive Yuan's discussion meeting on the 4th was held at 10:00 AM in the Executive Yuan's No. 1 official residence. The political affairs committee members and heads of ministries and commissions in Nanjing attended, presided over by Premier Sun himself. Those present included: Deputy Premier Wu Tiecheng, Political Affairs Committee members Zhang Qun and Zhu Jiahua, heads of ministries and commissions Xu Yongchang, Zhong Tianxin, Xu Kan, Liu Weizhi, Guan Jiyu, Pang Songzhou, Wu Shangying, Sun Yueqi, Chen Xueping, Huang Bodu, and Deputy Secretary-General Ni Jiongshang and more than ten people. Minister of Interior Hong Lanyou and Secretary-General Duanmu Kai also rushed from Shanghai to participate before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Two Main Points of Policy Address</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] At the Executive Yuan's discussion meeting on the 4th, Premier Sun asked the political affairs committee members to provide opinions on the policy address, which are now being integrated and organized. The discussion meeting on the 4th decided in principle that the policy direction will include two important parts: peace and political reform. The peace section will explain the government's determination and sincerity in seeking peace in order to achieve true and comprehensive peace. The Executive Yuan will also take necessary measures to remove obstacles to peace. Regarding the political reform section, the direction will point out the key points of reform, such as abolishing conscription of soldiers and grain, implementing a system of equal power between local and central governments, implementing land reform, streamlining the military, and balancing revenue and expenditure. After the meeting, Premier Sun hosted a banquet for the political affairs committee members and heads of ministries and commissions in Nanjing at his official residence.</p>
<h3>Salaries of Government Officials, Soldiers, and Teachers to Be Investigated Again</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] At the Executive Yuan's discussion meeting, the general reaction to the implementation of the financial and economic reform plan and the price increases in various regions were reviewed. Opinions were exchanged on effective ways to stabilize prices. It was generally believed that military reform and political reform should be earnestly promoted at present, and the lives of soldiers and the salaries of government officials and teachers should be improved as soon as possible. Detailed plans should be drafted by the heads of the finance, national defense, and accounting departments and implemented as soon as possible. Regarding the improvement of the salaries of government officials and teachers, the discussion meeting generally agreed that they should be adjusted according to the current month's cost of living index, and in principle, everyone agreed to implement it from this month. However, the implementation techniques still need to be studied and then submitted to the political affairs meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>Weng Wenhao Firmly Declines to Serve as Political Affairs Committee Member</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Weng Wenhao firmly declined to serve as a political affairs committee member. At the Executive Yuan's discussion meeting on the 4th, Premier Sun sent a car to pick him up several times, but Weng refused to go.</p>
<h3>Gu Mengyu Returns to Shanghai, No Intention of Becoming Minister of Education</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Gu Mengyu has visited Acting President Li twice. It is said that Acting President Li invited him to serve as Minister of Education, but Gu firmly declined because he had no intention of participating in actual politics. He left Nanjing on the 4th and returned to Shanghai. Gu will stay in Shanghai for the time being and does not intend to go elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Ordinary Telegrams to Five Places in North China Resume Transmission from Nanjing Telegraph Bureau</h3>

At the same time, the implementation of some important policies is subject to the Central Political Committee's prior study and approval. It is very likely that the Central Political Committee will be held in Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Holds Closed-Door Meeting to Discuss Motion to Promote Peace; Sun Ke to Report on Policy Direction on the 8th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Legislative Yuan held the second meeting of the third session on the morning of the 4th and began its proceedings. First, it handled three telegrams from the Executive Yuan. Next, it discussed measures to protect the basic freedoms of the people and release political prisoners, and decided to request the Executive Yuan to earnestly implement them. In the aforementioned reports and discussions, huge debates were stirred up. Then, Yuan President Tong Guanxian announced that Premier Sun had agreed to come to the Legislative Yuan on the 8th to report on the policy direction. In the afternoon, it discussed the motion to promote national peace. With the consent of the attendees, it was changed to a discussion meeting and held in secret at the request of a certain member.</p>
<p>The morning meeting was delayed until 9:45 AM because the number of attendees was sufficient to meet the quorum. Yuan President Tong Guanxian presided over the meeting, and 169 members attended. After the secretariat read out three telegrams from the Executive Yuan, several committees immediately began to speak, all pointing out that the Executive Yuan's notification to the Legislative Yuan members to attend the meeting in Guangzhou was illegal. Some people advocated that the report should be immediately changed to a discussion item and discussed. Some people advocated that it should be submitted for review and then brought to the meeting for discussion. Some committee members believed that since it was illegal, it should be returned to the Executive Yuan and not accepted. After a long argument, a compromise was reached to propose separate handling methods, that is, the item on the Executive Yuan's telegram about the meeting venue and dormitory in Guangzhou, which was of an administrative nature, should be deleted. The item on the Executive Yuan's letter notifying all agencies to move to Guangzhou should be submitted for review. The item on the Executive Yuan's telegram requesting notification of all committee members to attend the meeting in Guangzhou should be rejected because it was illegal. The chairman submitted it to a vote and it was passed. The four-point method for the progress of the work of the various committees drafted by the Procedural Committee was also passed by the attendees.</p>
<p>Request the Executive Yuan to Earnestly Implement Measures to Release Political Prisoners, etc.</p>
<p>After the break, the discussion began, and the chairman announced a change to the agenda, first discussing the second motion, namely, the "Motion proposed by Xiao Juetian et al. to confirm in advance that the government's four documents on protecting the basic freedoms of the people and releasing political prisoners, etc., are necessary measures and should be earnestly implemented by the Executive Yuan to appease the people and emphasize the rule of law." After the original proposer made a brief explanation, the attendees agreed to the motion in principle, but there was a dispute over the handling method. Some committee members believed that since Acting President Li had telegraphed the Executive Yuan to follow up, and the Executive Yuan had not implemented it effectively, the Legislative Yuan should raise questions. Therefore, they advocated changing it to a questioning motion. Some committee members believed that this motion was suitable for the people's hearts and should be passed by the Yuan. At the same time, someone else advocated submitting it for review. The chairman submitted three methods for voting: (1) change to a questioning motion, (2) submit for review, (3) vote on the original motion. At the time of voting on these three methods, none of the 166 committee members present could obtain a majority of support. So a fierce debate was reopened, and an opinion to revise the title of the original motion was proposed. A certain committee member shouted that this motion was to adapt to the people's hearts, and this motion must not be submitted for review to avoid arousing suspicion, so it must be passed. However, the Legislative Yuan should maintain a detached position, so the title must be corrected. As soon as this proposal came out, it immediately received a majority of applause. After a vote, it was passed by a majority and revised to "Request the Executive Yuan to earnestly implement various measures to protect the basic freedoms of the people and release political prisoners, etc., to emphasize the rule of law." The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM.</p>
<p>The meeting continued in the afternoon. It was not until 4:05 PM that 161 people were present. It was still chaired by Tong Guanxian, and the discussion proceeded on the motion proposed by Zhang Huiwen and others to hold a meeting of the entire body to discuss how to promote national peace. Zhang Huiwen explained on the spot that in this critical period, encountering this major issue, we cannot but express or make efforts in terms of responsibility and conscience. This kind of effort and expression must be carefully considered. We propose to hold a discussion meeting, one is to exchange opinions and reach a common point of view, and the other is to wait for colleagues from various places who are about to come to Beijing to participate. A certain committee member spoke and advocated that the discussion meeting should be held in secret, and the Executive Yuan should send personnel to attend and report, and invite the Shanghai People's Delegation to come to the meeting to report. In addition, close contact should be maintained with the government officials in charge of the peace plan, and opinions should be exchanged with each other. The chairman sought the consent of the attendees and immediately changed the meeting to a discussion meeting and held it in secret at the request of the committee member. Only ten minutes after the meeting started, the reporters were asked to leave the venue and were kept out of the gate of peace.</p>
<p>Procedural Committee Decides on Agenda for Third Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Legislative Yuan's Procedural Committee held a meeting on the evening of the 4th to discuss the agenda for the third meeting of the third session. It was decided that the postal rate increase case should be included in the report items. The increased rate method that has been implemented should complete the legislative procedure retroactively and will be submitted to the Transportation and Finance Committees for review. Among the discussion items, there are two cases: One is the case proposed by Li Feng and more than one hundred people, requesting the heads of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan to return to Beijing to work. The case of the Executive Yuan's letter notifying the government agencies to move to Guangzhou, which was decided to be changed to a discussion item at the Yuan's meeting on the 4th, will be discussed jointly. The other is the proposal by Huang Tong and others to request the Executive Yuan to stop conscription of soldiers and grain, which will be submitted to the National Defense and Food Committees for review.</p>
<h3>Chen Yi's Whereabouts a Mystery; Hong Kong Reports That He Has Been Detained, But This Cannot Be Confirmed; Zhang Yanzhe Still Reading Books Behind Closed Doors in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the dismissal of Chen Yi, the former Chairman of Zhejiang Province, it is still impossible for all parties to explain where he has gone. According to reports, Chen did come to Shanghai for a period of time after his dismissal, and then traveled with Qian Zongqi. As for the rumor that Chen has gone to Taiwan, it is still impossible to confirm this here.</p>
<p>[Our Quzhou Dispatch, 4th] According to reporters who inquired with relevant parties, the rumor that Chen Yi was invited to Quzhou for recuperation could not be confirmed. Zhou Yi'e and Qian Zongqi have also not come to Quzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 4th] According to today's Overseas Chinese Daily in Hong Kong, Chen Yi has been detained for "pioneering local peace." The newspaper also reported that when Chen was in charge of Zhejiang, he advocated making Hangzhou an undefended city.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Zhang Yanzhe, former Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, is still living in Hangzhou. This morning, he called our office to subscribe to the newspaper. This afternoon, the reporter visited him and had a personal conversation, proving that the rumor that he accompanied Chen Yi to recuperate in a certain place in eastern Zhejiang is not true. When the reporter met Zhang, he discussed Chinese and Western culture and academic cultivation, etc., on the condition that he would not talk about current politics. Before leaving, he said that he was planning to take this opportunity to cultivate himself and read the newspaper, and he would not leave Hangzhou in the near future.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shizhao Talks About the Situation in Beiping</h3>
<p>No Special Changes Yet</p>
<p>[Our Report] The peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communists will apparently begin within a month. However, the opinions of people from both the Kuomintang and the Communist sides on the issue of peace and war have not yet reached a conclusion. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Zhang Shizhao (pictured), one of the three elders of the Shanghai peace delegation. According to Zhang, the opinions of the Communist side on the issue of peace and war have not yet been unified. Generally speaking, the literati advocate peace, while the military men advocate war. Although Zhou Enlai is known as a general, he is still a literati, and he is also a peace advocate. Secondly, he entrusted the reporter to inquire about the measures taken by the CCP in Beiping, because what some people are most concerned about is whether the CCP today is implementing Marxism or realizing New Democracy. Zhang said, we still cannot see any special changes in Beiping. Although prices are higher than in Nanjing and Shanghai, they are based on millet as the standard, so the fluctuations are not large, and they are working hard on the two points of material exchange and communication to achieve the effect of suppressing prices. The reporter then asked whether the CCP's measures in Beiping could be implemented in Shanghai. Zhang said, "Yes." Because the measures in Beiping are moderate, and so far the household registration has not been investigated. As for the CCP's control of newspapers, the act of stopping all newspapers that have changed their attitude, Zhang and others asked the CCP authorities, who replied that they "can admit mistakes." Regarding the arrest of Xu Huidong, speaker of the Beiping City Council, Zhang confirmed that it was true, but it may not be a big problem, because Xu originally planned to go south, but Fu Zuoyi persuaded him to stay. Therefore, after Xu was arrested, Fu interceded with the Communist side on his behalf. Regarding Fu's own freedom, Zhang said, "We have not seen any signs of unfreedom." Fu has attended their banquets many times, and Zhang's actions in Beiping are also free. However, for their safety, the CCP authorities often send military police to "protect" them. Zhang did not reveal the content of the meetings and talks with Mao Zedong and others, only saying that their mission has ended, but he believes that it is possible that government representatives Shao Lizi and Zhang Qun will participate. Also, Zhang will go to Beijing in the short term to visit Cheng Qian for a meeting.</p>
<h3>U.S. Refuses Silver Loan, Believes That Silver Dollars Minted by China Are in Danger of Flowing Abroad</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Reliable sources claim that U.S. officials have notified the Chinese government that the recently applied-for silver loan of 200 million U.S. dollars cannot be approved at this time. The main reason for the rejection is that the government's economy is unstable and cannot obtain lasting benefits from the loan, and it is pointed out that the silver dollars it mints are in danger of flowing abroad or into the Communist-controlled areas. It is heard that the new regulations in the Communist-controlled areas of North China prohibit the free circulation of silver dollars. The silver dollars circulating in the government area may be gradually absorbed into the Communist-controlled areas by causing people to stir up exchange rates. The government originally wanted to use the silver loan from the United States to support the new economic plan and raise silver dollars to allow them to circulate freely. However, due to insufficient minting equipment, it was unable to absorb the borrowed silver ingots in large quantities, which is also related to the U.S. decision. Finance Minister Xu Kan admitted that the government had contacted the United States about a silver loan, but no agreement was reached. The Central Bank of Shanghai said that the government is still seeking to borrow silver from the United States.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Visits Deputy Secretary Webb to Discuss the Use of Remaining U.S. Aid Funds; New U.S. Secretary of Defense Concerned About China's Political and Military Situation</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington Dispatch, 3rd] Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, visited U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Webb on the 3rd and had a half-hour meeting to discuss the use of the remaining funds under the U.S. aid to China fund.</p>
<p>It is reported that the U.S. economic aid to China of 275 million U.S. dollars and military aid to China of 125 million U.S. dollars have been almost completely used up.</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu said: His visit to Webb "is related to the use of the military aid fund, intending to clarify how to use the deadline of April 3 to make the most of this fund." He pointed out: There are many difficulties in purchasing some materials from manufacturers, so there may be many funds unused in the accounts of April 3. Ambassador Gu said: As a result of his visit, the issue of whether these funds will be reallocated after the deadline is being studied.</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu also discussed China's request for a fund of 500,000 U.S. dollars from the Economic Cooperation Administration to help Chinese students studying in the United States.</p>
<p>There are currently 3,600 Chinese students in the United States, some of whom are in urgent need of financial assistance. Ambassador Gu said: Although he did not receive a specific response from Webb, some people are very concerned about the welfare of these Chinese students studying in the United States. He said: The Chinese government is subsidizing Chinese students who have completed their studies to buy boats to return to China, but some students have not graduated and still need financial assistance.</p>
<p>At the same time, an embassy spokesperson said: China hopes to fully and effectively use the funds of U.S. aid, "its sincerity is the same as that of the United States." This statement is in response to newspaper criticisms of the use of the funds.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington Dispatch, 3rd] The State Department assured Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun on the 3rd that Secretary of State Acheson did not accuse the Chinese government of misusing U.S. aid.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington Dispatch, 3rd] According to well-informed sources, Johnson, nominated by Truman today as the new Secretary of Defense, is paying close attention to the current crisis in China. He has recently discussed the CCP issue with the President in several White House meetings and is deeply concerned about our country's political and military situation.</p>
<p>Hurley Delivers Speech Defending the Chinese Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington Dispatch, 3rd] Former U.S. Ambassador to China Hurley recently delivered a speech at the Foreign Service School of Georgetown University, defending the Chinese government. He said: The diplomatic mistakes made by the United States in the Yalta Conference in making concessions to the Soviet Union are the reason why the Communist Party has achieved success in China. Hurley admitted that China has a corrupt system, but the existence of this system has a long history, and China is unable to punish cunning people. The U.S. concessions to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference formed a plan, and the Communist Party's conquest of China was the consequence. He did not know who should be responsible for the concessions at the Yalta Conference, but President Roosevelt was a patient at Yalta.</p>
<h3>Wu Yu-hou's Membership</h3>
<p>The National Policy Research Association Has Revoked It</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The National Policy Research Association of university professors, which initiated the organization of the "Nanjing People's Peace Delegation" to Beiping, issued another statement on the 4th, reiterating that the delegation had been disbanded. The "China People's Peace Promotion Association" organized by the association was also deemed unnecessary to continue its work as the government was about to start peace talks with the Chinese Communists, and it was decided to end it. The statement also stated: "The Standing Committee of the National Policy Research Association of Chinese University Professors has revoked the membership of Standing Committee member Wu Yu-hou due to his recent erratic behavior and absurd remarks, and his personal activities outside the association will have nothing to do with the association from now on."</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Wu Yu-hou and Wu Zhe-sheng flew to Shanghai on a Central Airlines plane at 9:15 this morning, from where they will transfer to Nanjing. According to Wu Yu-hou's statement to reporters: Liao Chengzhi has gone to Beiping, and he is preparing to take the written peace proposal put forward by the Chinese Communists to Nanjing to report to President Sun and Acting President Li.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Public Opinion Representatives</h3>
<p>Believe the Independence Movement Propaganda</p>
<p>Is a Smokescreen Deliberately Released by Ambitious Individuals</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 4th] Recently, various reports have mentioned the activities of the Taiwan Independence League and its propaganda that Taiwan is merely occupied by China. This reporter has recently interviewed public opinion representatives and intellectuals in Taiwan, and they all pointed out frankly that this is a smokescreen deliberately laid out by ambitious individuals in an attempt to achieve their conspiracy. They fundamentally deny the existence of the so-called Taiwan Independence League; and claim that this is by no means done by genuine Taiwanese compatriots.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Unity Innovation Peace</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Peace Delegation has completed its mission and returned with joy, and the atmosphere of peace throughout the country has suddenly become thicker. Dr. Yan Huiqing brought back a letter from Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party to Acting President Li, stating that the Chinese Communist Party would announce the list of peace talk representatives after March 15, determine the location of the peace talks, and begin negotiations immediately. This letter can explain that the Shanghai Peace Delegation's claim that "the Chinese Communist Party is willing to conduct peace talks with the government on an equal basis" is not an empty statement. At the same time, in order to show the government's sincerity in seeking peace, Acting President Li specially convened a meeting of central and local leaders on the "day to designate ten people to be responsible for drafting a peace plan, which is to be completed within ten days. Although its content is not yet known, judging from the dynamics in all aspects, the prospect of peace seems to have been encouraged, and there is hope that the haze in the sky may be cleared as a result.</p>
<p>However, the road to peace is really a long and arduous one. The Shanghai Peace Delegation's written statement said: "Although there are many difficulties in the future of peace talks, there is great hope." Conversely, it can also be said that "although the hope is great, there are still many difficulties." There is a history of more than ten years of separation and reunion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and their suspicion has not come about overnight. Now, if they want to dispel suspicion and reconcile, it cannot be achieved overnight. However, if both sides can meet each other with sincerity, take the country and the people as the most important thing, and tolerate each other at any time and in everything, it will not be difficult to dissolve the accumulated suspicion in the past. Therefore, we cannot but pay special attention to the preparatory work done by both sides before the start of the peace talks. We have no way of knowing the real situation on the Chinese Communist side, so let's set it aside for the time being, but for the various efforts made by the government recently to promote peace, we are willing to contribute some opinions on the occasion of the Legislative Yuan's review of the peace plan.</p>
<p>First, seeking peace must be sincere, and it goes without saying that the government must show the facts of wholeheartedly seeking peace; but relying on one side's sincerity and willingness to compromise to seek peace alone, if the other party is not sincere, peace talks will not be easy to succeed. Peace talks are like a couple making up after a quarrel. If the husband doesn't give in three points, the wife has to give in three points. If each other recalls the old love in the past, and there is something good in the past, then the broken mirror can still be reunited, let alone anything else? However, the key lies in whether both parties can indeed be tolerant. Secondly, peace talks are like buying and selling in the market. It will probably take some "bargaining" before a "deal" is made. No matter how high the seller sets the "empty head", no matter how the buyer wants to "cut the price in half", as long as both parties are sincere in making this transaction, there is a possibility that this deal will be made. Using this as an example, no matter which side, don't regard this peace negotiation as surrender and acceptance of surrender, then it can be hoped to succeed. Otherwise, if the representatives of Acting President Li are forced to accept peace terms in the style of a textbook, it will not be like peace talks, but unconditional surrender. As for how the government can obtain this equal status, the most important thing is the internal unity of the government. Unity is strength, and strength can be balanced. Therefore, we have always used this yardstick to weigh the government's recent efforts to seek peace. Any measures that weaken the government's position in the peace talks are the most likely to show that the government has sincerity in peace, but they are not what wise people should do, and they are only harmful and not beneficial to the future of peace. Even if one borrows the pen of a foreign news agency reporter to create rumors and sow discord, as if this is the only way to feel happy, it is actually harmful and not beneficial to peace talks and the future of China.</p>
<p>Second, after China has gone through eight years of war against Japan, and then more than three years of internal strife, the people of the whole country have become refugees after the disaster. If the war cannot be stopped immediately, the suffering people will feel that they cannot survive. Both sides have expressed their willingness to conduct peace talks to end the war as soon as possible, and have repeatedly stated that it is for the sake of pitying the suffering of the people. However, today, the war and peace have not been decided, and it will take a considerable amount of time to delay. How can the government sit idly by and allow the people to suffer? Therefore, during the peace talks, for the sake of being concerned about the suffering of the people, in addition to sincerely seeking peace and realizing peace as soon as possible, the government should also "do its best", innovate politics, and reduce the suffering of the people. All administrative affairs that the people are grieved and indignant about should be stopped immediately. The points expressed by President Sun to reporters in Nanjing yesterday, such as changing conscription to recruitment, and then reducing the number of soldiers, and at the same time canceling the requisition of grain and borrowing, etc., we only hope that they will be cashed as soon as possible, and no longer be regarded as empty checks.</p>
<p>In short, unity, innovation, and peace are already the national policies of the current time, and the government should make every effort to achieve them, but "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world", and everyone in the country has the responsibility for promoting the realization of peace. Everyone should know that peace cannot fall from the sky, but must be achieved through the efforts of the people. With the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks approaching, the people of the whole country should stand up, provide the people's opinions, and exert the people's strength, so that both sides cannot but obey public opinion and abandon war and seek peace.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army Has Drafted a Preliminary Action Plan for Crossing the River Offensive Chen Yi's Troops Are Responsible for the Downstream Task, Focusing on Zhenjiang and Wuhu Lin Biao's Two Columns March South and Arrive at Luohe</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 4th] According to a communiqué from the Ministry of National Defense: Lin Biao's Third and Fifth Columns, after leaving Tianjin in early February, passed through Dezhou, Jinan, and Xuzhou and turned west along the Longhai Railway to Zhengzhou, then went south along the Pinghan Road and recently arrived at Luohe. According to unconfirmed intelligence: In the Central Plains Military Conference held by the Communist Army in a certain place in Central China, in addition to deciding that Chen Geng would serve as the commander of the Western Front Corps and Chen Yi would serve as the commander of the Eastern Front Corps, a preliminary action plan for the crossing-the-river offensive was drafted as follows: (1) Chen Yi's troops would be responsible for the downstream crossing-the-river task, focusing on Wuhu and Zhenjiang, and would go straight to Hangzhou after capturing Nanjing and Shanghai; (2) Chen Geng's troops would cross the river via Yichang and Shashi and then detour east along the Yuehan Railway; (3) The Central Corps, with Lin Biao's troops as the main force, would attack Changsha along the Yuehan Railway after defeating the Nationalist army around Wuhan, and then look west at Jiujiang, cut off the Zhegan Railway, and attack Hangzhou, echoing Chen Yi's offensive.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu is Actively Deploying Troops Are Frequently Deployed Along the River Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 4th] The Communist Army in northern Jiangsu is actively deploying, posing a threat to the south of the Yangtze River. The Nationalist army's bridgehead positions in Shijiaqiao, facing Zhenjiang, are now under strict guard. The situation of the Communist army on the front has changed again today. According to military intelligence: (1) In addition to a part of the 10th Column, about 1,000 people, there are also about 600 people from the Huaihe Brigade and about 500 people from the Jiangdu Independent Regiment on the east bank of the canal facing the Shijiaqiao bridgehead. (2) The Huaihai Independent Brigade of the Communist Army, which was originally stationed on the east bank of the canal, has now been transferred to Dongtai for reorganization. (3) The Communist Army on the west bank of the canal is still the New 6th Regiment and the Xinghua Independent Regiment.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 4th] The Communist Army in northern Jiangsu is frequently deployed. According to reports: the main force of the 11th Column of Chen Yi's troops is concentrated on the Kou (An) Tai (Xian) line and is currently moving towards Taixing; the 12th Column has arrived at the Shaobo Xiannvmiao line, and a part of the 10th Column, about 1,000 people, has moved south to face the Nationalist army positions in Shijiaqiao (in the area east of the canal). According to the air force's reconnaissance report yesterday: between Tongyu Zhan Shangdonghe and Haian, and between Jiangyan and Haian on the Haitai line, there were about 25,000 Communist army formations concentrating on Haian. Another part of the Communist army, about 15,000 people, moved from Haian along the highway towards Rugao. The above Communist army totals 60,000 people, which is obviously related to the information that the air force recently discovered that more than 9,000 Communist army troops were moving south between Yancheng and Funing. The military has not yet received accurate information on the number of this Communist army, but relevant parties strongly claim that this Communist army must be the 10th, 11th, and 12th columns that moved south from the Lianghuai area, and may have been transferred from southern Shandong. Looking at the Yangtze River line in northern Jiangsu, in addition to the 2nd, 3rd, 9th, Bohai, and Rapid Columns originally stationed between Yangzhou and Tianchang, the general public believes that the Communist Army will use the 10th, 11th, and 12th Columns that moved south from Lianghuai on the line from Yangzhou to Taixing, and the part moving south from the Tongyu line may be assembled on the east and west banks of the Yangtze River below Jingjiang and Nantong, to pose as if they are crossing the river.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 4th] It is reported that a certain high-level command post of the Communist Army stationed in Yangzhou is currently outside the South Gate, and the headquarters of the 10th Column is outside the North Gate Fengqiao Bridge. In addition, the Communist Army has set up a mountain gun outside Fuyun Gate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 4th] The Communist Army in Jiangbei is moving south. Apart from a small contact on the Sanwen River on the evening of the 2nd, it is expected that there may be a small battle for Guazhou in the next few days. In total, the Communist Army in the Yangzhou Tai Gaobao area has the numbers of the 2nd, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 4th Columns. Its Southeast Detachment and the Yangzhou Yi local team are harassing near Guazhou, and their strength is not great.

<p>[Report from the United Press, Oslo, on the 4th] The Norwegian Parliament passed a resolution on the 4th by an overwhelming majority to join the negotiations on the Atlantic Pact.

<p>[Report from Reuters, Oslo, on the 4th] The Norwegian Foreign Ministry delivered a reply yesterday to the Soviet Ambassador to Norway, rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Norway, stating that Norway belongs to Western Europe.

<p>[Report from the United Press, Bulgarian Capital, on the 4th] Fifteen Christian pastors were charged with treason.

<h3>Soviet Union Proposes International Control of Atomic Bombs; The United Nations Should Consider It; Statement Issued by the Federation of American Scientists</h3>
<p>[Report from the United Press, Washington, on the 3rd] The Federation of American Scientists issued a statement today expressing satisfaction with the resumption of discussions by the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission after a long period of silence. However, it stated that the United Nations should carefully consider the Soviet Union's proposal to establish an international control agency while destroying atomic weapons. When the Security Council recently debated the issue of atomic energy, the Soviet Union accused the United States of attempting to hoard atomic bombs and threaten the world, and demanded that major powers notify the United Nations of the number of atomic bombs they each have before the end of March. The Soviet Union insisted that atomic weapons should be considered illegal and destroyed before the establishment of an international control program. Later, it proposed at the United Nations General Assembly that both could be carried out simultaneously, which was an important step towards agreement, and the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission should consider it in detail.</p>
<h3>Forrestal's Resignation Approved; Johnson Succeeds as Secretary of Defense; Army Secretary Royal Still Intends to Retire</h3>
<p>[Report from the United Press, Washington, on the 3rd] President Truman announced today that Secretary of Defense Forrestal had submitted his resignation due to private matters and will step down on the 31st of this month. His vacancy will be filled by former Under Secretary of the Army Johnson. Secretary of the Army Royal, Secretary of the Navy Sullivan, and Secretary of the Air Force Symington will remain in office.</p>
<p>Truman also produced correspondence between himself and Forrestal, saying that while he had approved the resignation, it was not his wish and that he hoped that Forrestal could still assist the government in strengthening national defense. Forrestal is 57 years old. He served as Secretary of the Navy from May 1944 to July 1947, and was the only remaining important figure from President Roosevelt's administration. There had been talk of him leaving the cabinet last year.</p>
<p>The new Secretary Johnson is a lawyer from West Virginia, aged 58. He served as Under Secretary of the Army from 1937 to 1940 during President Roosevelt's successive re-elections. Last year, he served as the chairman of the Democratic Party's Finance Committee and was responsible for raising campaign funds during the party's bleak hopes of winning the presidency, and he put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>[Report from the United Press, Washington, on the 3rd] Secretary of the Army Royal sent a congratulatory letter today after the President announced the appointment of Johnson as Secretary of Defense, and reiterated his intention to retire at a press conference. It is said that "as soon as I have a clear conscience, I hope to be relieved of my duties and return to my hometown."</p>
<h3>Johnson Expresses His Views: The United States Must Maintain a Strong Military Force</h3>
<p>Otherwise, There Will Be No Peace in the World</p>
<p>[Report from our own correspondent] Washington, broadcast on the 4th: Newly appointed US Secretary of Defense Johnson recently stated that the United States must maintain a strong military force, because if the United States is not strong and powerful, there will be no peace in the world. Johnson met with former Secretary Forrestal at the White House today, and Johnson revealed that Forrestal had informed him of this news a few days ago. Johnson will take office on March 31, and it is expected that the Senate will approve his appointment. Forrestal said that he has not yet decided on new plans after leaving office, but he will submit recommendations to Congress requesting amendments to the Unified Command Act of the Army, Navy, and Air Force passed in 1947, because the current level of unification of the three services is still not satisfactory.</p>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, Washington, on the 3rd] Observers here believe that Truman's appointment of Air Force expert Johnson as Secretary of Defense symbolizes that the US Air Force will be greatly reorganized. Johnson is a director of the Vought Aircraft Factory and personally planned the manufacture of the B-17 Flying Fortress during the Roosevelt administration. He was also responsible for shipping military supplies to Britain at the beginning of World War I, despite opposition from his colleagues in the War Department. Johnson is also the initiator of the "Strategic Air Command," so his rise to power will prompt the resignation of Army Secretary Royal, because Royal adheres to the principle of the Army First.</p>
<h3>New Israeli Cabinet Formed; Application to Join the United Nations Can Be Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from our own correspondent] New York, broadcast on the 4th: Tel Aviv news: The new Israeli Prime Minister, Gurion, notified President Weizmann today that he has formed a four-party coalition cabinet. The Labor Party led by Gurion occupies eleven seats in the new cabinet. The four parties can get seventy-five votes in the parliament, which is more than half, so the vote of confidence will definitely be passed.</p>
<p>[Report from the United Press, Lake Success, on the 4th] The United Nations Security Council is expected to approve the Israeli application to join the United Nations today. The four major powers, the United States, China, France, and the Soviet Union, will all vote in favor, and Britain has indicated that it does not intend to use its veto.</p>
<h3>There are Three Main Reasons for Forrestal's Departure</h3>
<p>[Report from Agence France-Presse, Washington, on the 3rd] Diplomatic sources said today that there are three main reasons for the resignation of US Secretary of Defense Forrestal: First, on the issue of the Arab-Jewish dispute, Forrestal has always advocated that the United States support Arab countries in order to protect US oil rights in the Middle East, but Democratic leaders opposed this view. Henderson, the Director of the Middle East Division of the State Department, was forced to resign because he agreed with Forrestal's views, and Forrestal also felt uneasy in his position. Second, Forrestal opposed Norway's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty, believing that this move violated the United States' military interests, while the State Department agreed to Norway's participation. Third, Forrestal has always advocated an equal balance of power between the Army, Navy, and Air Force, which was also opposed by the faction that advocated expanding the Air Force. According to a report from the United Press, Forrestal was quite involved in internal government disputes and reportedly had disagreements with the President on the Holy Land and other diplomatic issues. Although his family was wealthy, he did not provide much financial or other support during Truman's campaign.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Invite Representatives from Southern Austria to Debate the Details of the Austrian Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Report from our own correspondent] London, broadcast on the 4th: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' representatives decided today to invite representatives from Yugoslavia and Austria to attend the meeting to debate the details of the Austrian Peace Treaty. However, the timing of their attendance was not resolved after three hours of fierce debate among the four powers. It was then decided to adjourn the meeting until next Monday for further discussion. Today, the Soviet representative insisted that the Southern representative must attend and express his views first, and then the four powers will discuss it again, which is obviously intended to make the Southern country make new concessions in its demands on Austria.</p>
<h3>Israeli-Jordanian Peace Talks at a Standstill</h3>
<p>Israeli-Lebanese Negotiations Have Reached an Agreement</p>
<p>[Report from the United Press, Rhodes, on the 3rd] Jordan's insistence on placing the issue of Arab refugees at the top of the agenda has stalled the Israeli-Jordanian armistice talks. The signing of the Israeli-Lebanese agreement may be delayed until the 4th or 5th due to technical difficulties in preparing the translation, but officials said that the agreement is nearing completion. It is reported that the agreement includes the following main points: (1) Redrawing the border between the two countries in a way that favors Israel, and (2) Israel will cede several Lebanese villages in the southwest corner of the pocket to Lebanon.</p>
<h3>South Africa Plans to Raise The Official World Gold Price</h3>
<p>US Treasury Secretary Snyder Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>[Report from the United Press, Washington, on the 3rd] Treasury Secretary Snyder declared today that the United States supports the dispute between the International Monetary Fund and the South African Federation over the gold price issue. The United States insists that the official world gold price should remain at the original price of thirty-five dollars per ounce. It is difficult to agree with the South African Prime Minister's claim that this official price cannot last. South Africa, the world's largest gold producer, intends to raise the gold price by six dollars and fifty cents to forty-one dollars and fifty cents per ounce.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Repatriates僑 Withdraws National Flag and Withdraws from the American-Occupied Zone of Germany. The Soviet Union Retaliates by Expelling the American War Dead Custodial Team</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Frankfurt, 4th] The Soviet Union yielded to American pressure today, ordering its repatriation mission to withdraw from here. The mission, consisting of eight members, lowered its national flag this morning, angrily left its office, and departed in three cars and two trucks for the Soviet zone of Germany.</p>
<p>The vehicles were laden with luggage, along with worn tires and gasoline drums. The departing personnel appeared stern, and the drivers insulted passing American women by spitting at them. The interior of the office was a mess, as the delegation had spent hours burning documents beforehand, but all the luggage was inspected by American military police.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] The Soviet repatriation mission entered the Soviet zone this morning and immediately boarded a plane for Moscow to submit a report to its government. At approximately the same time, the American War Dead Custodial Committee, which had been ordered to leave by Soviet Military Commander Sokolovsky, arrived in Berlin from the Soviet zone. The American military commander in Berlin, Holley, told reporters that General Clay would protest the matter to the Soviets, as the remains of many American soldiers killed in action during the war had yet to be found in the Soviet zone, and therefore their mission was not yet complete.</p>
<h3>On the Soviet Union Repatriation Mission Incident, the United States Rejects Soviet Protest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The U.S. government recently sent a note to the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow, in response to the Soviet government's note regarding the incident of February 20th. The U.S. response flatly rejected the Soviet Union's protest, asserting that it completely distorted the facts. The Soviet protest note claimed that the United States' actions violated the repatriation agreement signed in Crimea in February 1945 and further accused American officials in Germany of obstructing the repatriation mission's work. The U.S. response rejected all these charges and declared that the U.S. government fully approved of the stance taken by the U.S. military commander, General Clay, and demanded that the Soviet repatriation mission immediately withdraw from the American-occupied zone. The note further pointed out that the Soviet repatriation mission was repatriating fewer than nine people per month, and that future repatriation work could be handled by the Soviet military mission. Regarding the Soviet protest's claim that anti-Soviet groups in Germany were hindering the Soviet repatriation mission's work, the U.S. response dismissed it as unacceptable.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Will Exert Political Pressure on India</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 4th (broadcast): British government Far East experts anticipate that the Soviet Union will exert political pressure on India. They state that after Norway refused to sign a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's expansion to the West has encountered setbacks and will instead shift to the East. They believe that the riots in Calcutta last week and the Bengali government's ban on Communist activities have not actually diminished the strength of the Communist Party, as the Indian government's declaration of an anti-Communist policy has in fact caused the Communist Party to switch from open activities to underground work, and the Communist Party has already gained leadership of various important labor unions. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's expansion of power in Xinjiang and Moscow Radio's attacks on Nehru can all be seen as signs of the Soviet Union's designs on India.</p>
<h3>Britain to Donate 103 Aircraft to the Indian Air Force</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 4th (broadcast): Bombay dispatch: The British government has decided to transfer 100 British fighter planes and three jet aircraft to the Indian Air Force. The Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Air Force, Elmer-stedt, has already sailed for England today to inspect these aircraft.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Passes Massive Military Expenditure by Overwhelming Majority. Defense Minister Vigorously Defends Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 3rd] The House of Commons tonight passed Britain's largest peacetime military budget, totaling £759,860,000, by a vote of 227 to 3.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] During today's debate in the House of Commons on the government's defense policy, Defense Minister Alexander first addressed the House, strongly asserting that since the Soviet Union retained its "veto power over peace and security," Britain must assume its full share of responsibility in the defense of the free nations of the world.</p>
<p>Alexander stated that Britain has always believed that Britain must act collectively. In today's world, it is impossible to believe that a country can isolate itself. The Western European Union Defense Committee, chaired by Field Marshal Montgomery, is formulating plans to deal with any emergency, and the defense ministers of Western European countries have made considerable progress. Regarding the North Atlantic Treaty, Alexander said that at this stage, it was not convenient to make any statements, but the fact that this agreement was under discussion deserved full attention. Alexander also assured the House of Commons that Britain had sufficient stocks of military equipment, and the government was not satisfied with this, as the equipment needed after the defense plans currently being formulated were fully implemented would be much more advanced than what currently existed. Regarding colonial defense, Alexander said that recent events had shown the need to promote economic development in the colonies, so it was not advisable to develop local defense forces on a large scale at this time, but the need to maintain internal security had also been fully recognized. The colonial governments had been making various efforts to strengthen their local guard forces. Subsequently, an opposition motion to reject the government's statement of defense policy, arguing that its content was inappropriate, was rejected by a vote of 291 to 155.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Between Dutch and Indonesian Leaders Still Pending, The Hague Conference to be Postponed, United States Opposes UN Sending Representatives to Attend</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 3rd] Well-informed sources claim that the round table conference scheduled to be held in The Hague on March 12 may be postponed because preliminary negotiations with the leaders of the Indonesian Republic will require considerable time. It is reported that the Indonesian leaders in Bangka are very divided on the round table conference. One faction, led by Hatta, advocates participation, while another faction, led by the head of the Republic's delegation, Wim, intends to refuse to participate, as the Netherlands' convening of the round table conference is tantamount to rejecting the Security Council's January 28 recommendation.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 4th (broadcast): UN official Filipino representative Romulo hosted a luncheon today for the UN representatives of various countries who had attended the New Delhi conference to informally exchange views on the Indonesian issue.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 3rd] The Netherlands' representative to the United Nations, Hogelonghi, sent a letter today to the current chairman of the Security Council, Cuban representative Alvarez, requesting that the United Nations send representatives to participate in the Dutch-Indonesian round table conference to be held in The Hague on March 12. The letter stated that the Netherlands' proposal, though different in approach, was aimed at promoting Indonesian independence, so the Security Council should support its success. The Security Council is expected to discuss the Indonesian issue next Monday. A spokesperson for the United States stated that the United States would oppose UN representatives attending the round table conference unless the leaders of the Indonesian Republic agreed to attend. According to news from Batavia, the leaders of the Indonesian Republic have refused to participate, and the Netherlands has recognized another group to represent the Indonesian Republic at the conference.</p>

<p>Burmese Envoy Expresses to Nehru</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 4th (broadcast): New Delhi dispatch: Well-informed sources claim that India's previous proposal to Burma to mediate the dispute between Burma and the Karen people has apparently been rejected by the Burmese government. Indian officials revealed that Burmese Attorney General U Chan Htoon had told Nehru that the Burmese government was capable of resolving its internal disputes without foreign assistance. The dispute between Burma and the Karen people, and the increase in Communist forces in Burma, have caused deep unease in Eastern countries. Nehru and Evatt expressed concern, so Nehru sent a letter to Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu, suggesting five-nation mediation of the internal conflict.</p>

<h3>Raising Subsistence Funds for Garrison Troops, Collecting Security Donations for Three Months, Targeting Larger Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, Collection Committee Established Yesterday, Over One Hundred Members Elected</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Since the beginning of this year, the number of garrison troops stationed in the city has suddenly increased, estimated to be around 200,000. The central government's allocation for their subsistence is currently only sufficient for two catties of pork, two catties of soybean oil, and one catty of salt per person per month. It is impossible to purchase other vegetables and fuel, which inevitably leads to borrowing from merchants and residents in the city. In order to protect the peace of mind of merchants and residents and to promote harmonious relations between the military and the people, the municipal government has repeatedly consulted with the central government and relevant military authorities, agreeing that all troops stationed in the city will be provided with one catty of vegetables and one and a half catties of firewood per person per month by local efforts to supplement their food. It was also agreed that the relevant authorities should restrain the troops from disturbing the people. After the above principles were determined, the city's trade associations advanced 150 million yuan last month to purchase 8,000 dan of firewood from Hangzhou. The Taishi firewood industry association supplied 20,000 dan at 80% of the market price. In addition, a large quantity of vegetables was purchased from the Shanghai vegetable industry association and allocated to various troops through the city's military-civilian cooperation committee. Leading figures in the city's industrial and commercial sectors, recognizing that the local authorities had painstakingly negotiated this supplementary supply method, believed that funds should be raised as soon as possible. After a concrete exchange of views, it was decided to collect from the various trade associations in the name of "local security donation" and to organize a local security donation collection committee to be responsible for handling the matter. The committee has been actively preparing for the past week and is now ready. Yesterday afternoon, a founding conference was held at the city's chamber of commerce. More than 100 people attended, including Xu Jishang from the city's chamber of commerce, Liu Hongsheng from the city's industrial association, and the chairmen of various trade associations. Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan also attended the meeting to explain the authorities' unavoidable need to ask the local community for money and expressed hope that after the establishment of the committee, all collection, procurement, auditing, and other work would be handled by personnel selected by the committee itself, with the municipal government only playing an assisting role. The distribution and allocation of funds in the future would be the responsibility of the military-civilian cooperation committee. The proposed method was to print "vegetable tickets" and "firewood tickets" and distribute them to the troops to be collected from designated locations or shops, in order to avoid some unnecessary disturbances. Subsequently, the entire body passed the local security donation collection method and elected 148 members, including 37 standing committee members: Liu Hongsheng, Hu Xiyuan, Xu Xueyu, Wu Yunzhu, Luo Qinghua, Pan Shihao, Jin Runku, Tian Heqing, Zhu Zhuyi, Guo Yongxi, etc. Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, and Wang Naixu were elected as auditing committee members. At the same time, Mayor Wu was also appointed as the chairman, and Du Yuesheng and Xu Jixiang were appointed as vice-chairmen. Wang Xianqing was appointed as the general secretary, and Yan Esheng was appointed as the chief secretary. Speaker Pan was also appointed as a guiding committee member. Finally, the entire body passed the resolution that the local security donation would officially begin tomorrow (the 6th).</p>

<h3>New Police Chief Mao Sen Emphasizes Prohibition of Corruption Among Subordinates. Sincerely Hopes That Friction Between the Military and Civilians Will Not Occur Again</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] General Mao Sen, the new police chief who is scheduled to take office next Monday, met with reporters yesterday and stated: The police bureau is an agency that is close to the people. All issues, such as the handling of labor and student movements, will be handled in accordance with the law and will not go beyond the scope. After taking office, he does not intend to make any changes to the personnel of the police bureau. He will make every effort to rectify discipline, and corruption and incompetence will not be tolerated. Mao stressed: My consistent style of doing things in the past, in addition to paying attention to reality, is to absolutely prohibit subordinates from being corrupt in personnel management and strictly require staff to be diligent in their duties. He will certainly implement this spirit in the future. However, the police bureau has a large structure and complex personnel. The establishment of good discipline, in addition to his own efforts, still requires the assistance of all sectors of society. General Mao sincerely hoped that friction between the garrison and the citizens would not occur again in the future, causing emotional harm. He also said that since the police bureau is a security agency, it should closely cooperate with the garrison command to promote everything.</p>

<h3>Hairdressing Prices to Use Index, Base Number Two Jiao in Gold Yuan</h3>

<h3>New Rent Standards Seek Reasonableness and Thoroughness. Director Shen Will Invite All Parties to Further Solicit Concrete Opinions</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The new rent standards for the city have been drafted by the Land Administration Bureau and were originally to be submitted to the Municipal Conference for review this week. However, because this matter is related to the housing problems of five million citizens, standards that are too high or too low are likely to cause disputes. Director Shen of the Land Administration Bureau has paid close attention to this and will revise them more carefully, so the draft could not be sent out this week. The bureau met with Jiang Hao, Chen Peide, and other representatives of the Tenants' Union yesterday. It is claimed that the City Council originally resolved to convert one yuan of pre-war rent into four or five fen in gold yuan, using this as a base number and multiplying it by the cost of living index. This resolution is far from reality, and the Tenants' Union is willing to agree to raise it based on the current situation. The Real Estate Association also sent representatives Zhu Xiaofang, Chen Shukun, Zhang Dehua, and others to the Land Administration Bureau to state their opinions yesterday. It is claimed that the Real Estate Association has always prohibited member companies from renting in foreign currency and in kind. If there are such situations, they will be corrected. The association hopes that the Land Administration Bureau will refer to the rent standards of Nanjing and Guangzhou, and in accordance with Article 97 of the Land Law, further investigate the actual situation in the city and formulate new and reasonable standards. Director Shen believes that both sides' opinions are not without merit. In order to make the method more thorough, he has scheduled to convene the Real Estate Association, the Tenants' Union, the Court, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the General Labor Union, the Industrial Association, and other relevant agencies and legal entities at Duo Shi in the afternoon of the 8th of this month to solicit concrete opinions from all parties to serve as the final correction of the draft.</p>

<p>[Shanghai News Agency News] The price of rice in the city has been trading at an unreasonably high price for more than a week. On the 3rd of this month, the prices in the north and south markets soared to over 20,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, a reporter asked Wang Jiashu, the director of the Economic Administration of the Social Affairs Bureau, about this issue concerning people's livelihood. According to him, since Mayor Wu ordered the restoration of free trade in rice, the price of rice has indeed been soaring. The Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau have attached great importance to this, but monitoring under market control is a temporary solution and cannot make the price of rice tend towards a reasonable state. Therefore, the Municipal Government's People's Food Allocation Office and the Social Affairs Bureau have recently consulted and decided to solve the people's food problem from the root. Mayor Wu has negotiated with the Central Bank for a loan to prepare grain reserves for three months. The loan amount is quite large. According to related sources, the loan amount will be around 10 billion yuan. The Central Bank has accepted it in principle, and after negotiation, it will borrow ships from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to purchase large quantities from domestic and foreign production areas. This may also be a comforting agent amid the white terror.</p>
<h3>Coal Shortage Serious, Still Unresolved, Two Railway Bureaus Consider Reducing Train Schedules</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The coal shortage problem for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways remains serious. For the past month, the two railways have been borrowing coal daily from various locations. The Smoke Coal Adjustment Committee and the Four Mines Joint Operation Office have repeatedly lent coal, undoubtedly providing the greatest possible assistance. However, the railway bureaus are limited by their own finances, unable to purchase and store large quantities. Moreover, coal prices have been rising sharply. The average price in February increased as much as twelve times. The railway bureaus' total revenue for January was insufficient to cover the coal expenses for that month. The deficit had to be balanced with loans from the Central Bank. Director Wang Zhaohuai is troubled by this daily, running around and contacting various parties. He is considering reducing the number of train schedules on both lines to save coal. Although this method is akin to "cutting off one's nose to spite one's face," there are indeed no better solutions before thoroughly improving the economy and clearing coal supply channels.</p>
<h3>A Package Found at the North Station, Hiding a Large Amount of Communist Currency</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, a large quantity of North Sea Bank banknotes used in the Communist areas was discovered at the North Station in this city. It happened around seven o'clock in the morning when the "Triumph" express train on the Beijing-Shanghai line was about to depart. A railway police officer noticed a piece of luggage wrapped in a printed cotton sheet left on the platform, unattended. As the train departed, no one came to claim it. The railway police officer went forward to inspect and saw that the package was full of stacks of new banknotes. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be 500-yuan notes from the North Sea Bank. These banknotes were very small in size, shaped like the one-jiao coins issued by the Central Bank before the war (see the image). The printing paper was extremely rough. The estimated total amount was around five to six million yuan (based on face value). The railway police authorities are currently considering how to dispose of it.</p>
<h3>Standing Director of the China Textile Corporation Involved in House Purchase Scandal, Secretary Guo Ying Released on Bail, Ni Bi Announces Results of Various Investigations</h3>
<p>Commissioner Ni Bi of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Committee told reporters about the results of the committee's recent investigations: (1) Central Bank gold and silver southward transportation case: It was found that when the bank received the order from Acting President Li on February 17 to stop the transportation, it had already stopped the transportation. Although the amount transported accounted for two-thirds of the total amount of deposits, the gold and silver currently in Shanghai are still substantial and sufficient to meet needs. Furthermore, the destinations such as Taiwan and Guangzhou are all within the country, so there is nothing inappropriate. (2) The China Textile Corporation case is divided into two parts: A. Chairman Liu Weichi's use of 18 million yuan of public funds: It was found that the funds were allocated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for evacuation purposes; the funds were used for public purposes, which is legitimate, and Mr. Liu has no responsibility. B. The standing director's house purchase matter: It was found that Liu Weichi was not aware of this matter beforehand, nor did he approve it. It was purely an unauthorized action by Guo Yingying, the secretary of the board of directors, so he should bear full responsibility. The Supervisory Office has now notified the police station to detain Guo and release him on bail, awaiting legal action. (3) Xu Shiyuan, an investigator from this office, was arrested recently in a case of "conspiring to riot and subvert the government." After sending personnel to Beijing for investigation, the office believes that the procedures for arrest by the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters were improper, and that the case was not transferred to the court for trial afterward, which is unconstitutional. Therefore, a protest has been lodged with the Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Household Rice Distribution to Begin Tomorrow, Prices to Be Announced Today</h3>

<h3>Robbery of Passengers on a Boat and Murder Committed, Five Robbers Convicted Yesterday and Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Hua Zhongpin, who had been unemployed for a long time, together with Xian Yupin and seven others (still at large), carried guns and conspired to rob on April 9, 1947. They purchased tickets in Ningbo and boarded the Hua'an ship sailing to Dinghai. When the ship reached the vicinity of Zhenhai, they took out their weapons together. Gu Yupin first shot and killed three policemen and one passenger in military uniform on the ship with a gun. They forbade the passengers on the ship from moving, searched the items carried by each passenger, robbed 120 million yuan in legal tender and gold ornaments, and fled together on a small boat that had been booked to pick them up.

Zhang Lizhong, together with others (still at large), used weapons to rob several million yuan of legal tender, four bags of free rice, nine cans of kerosene, and many cartons of cigarettes from ships sailing near Dinghai in July of the same year. In February of last year, they were arrested one after another by the police sub-bureaus of the three municipalities and transferred to the local court for trial. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Yuhuang sentenced: Liu Zhongpin was sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly robbing and intentionally killing people, and deprived of political rights for life. For jointly intending to illegally possess property, using violence and coercion to make it impossible to resist and taking other people's property, he was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprived of political rights for ten years. Zhang Caixin, Shi Xiangsheng, Zhang Lizhong, and Huang Huiding were jointly sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprived of political rights for ten years each for jointly intending to illegally possess property, using violence and coercion to make it impossible to resist and taking other people's property.

<h3>University Professors' Association to Discuss Salary Issues Tomorrow, Calculating Salaries Based on the Cost of Living Index is the Minimum Requirement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai National College and University Professors' Association is scheduled to hold its fifth meeting at the Shanghai Business College tomorrow afternoon. Liu Dajie, a spokesperson for the association, said yesterday: The visit to Beijing by the presidents of national colleges and universities in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou to request improvements in the treatment of faculty and staff and to increase the amount of public funding for students has yielded considerable results. The association would like to express its gratitude to the presidents for their hard work. The association previously requested the acting president to improve treatment by multiplying the original salary without any discount by the price index. Later, the presidents of the schools in Beijing revised it to calculate based on the cost of living index. Now, President Sun and Acting Minister Chen have indicated that the original salary must be discounted, and the matter of calculating according to the cost of living index must be discussed by the Executive Yuan before a decision can be made. The association's opinion on this matter will be discussed at the standing committee meeting to be held on the scheduled date. However, it must be stated in advance that calculating the treatment of faculty and staff according to the local cost of living index is the minimum requirement and cannot be compromised further. The current five hundredfold payment can only be used as a supplementary payment for February, and the salary for March must be based on the cost of living index announced for that month.</p>

<p>Authorities Provide Relief for Out-of-School Children, Continue to Add Classes in Primary Schools</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In late last month, the Shanghai Education Bureau and the Ministry of Education stationed in Shanghai personnel related to primary and secondary schools, and education experts such as Chen Heqin held a symposium to discuss providing relief for out-of-school youths and children. It was decided to expand primary and secondary school classes to broaden capacity. Regarding secondary school classes, Shizhuan, Xinlu, Jingye, and Jirong schools have added grades and enrolled students separately. As for primary schools, the Bide Primary School in the seventh district of this city has added two new classes, the Central National School in the sixteenth district has opened three classes, the Central School in the eleventh district has opened two classes, and the Central School in the ninth district has added one class.

<p>National Bank to Allocate a Portion of Funds and Grain Storage Fees for Various Schools First</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the presidents of sixteen national colleges and universities in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places went to Beijing to petition, the Executive Yuan agreed to allocate funds and grain storage fees in Shanghai. However, because the person in charge of the national treasury of the Ministry of Finance is not currently in Shanghai, they will have to go to Nanjing to complete the procedures. To this end, the presidents of the schools visited Liu Gongyun, the president of the National Bank, the night before to discuss the matter. President Liu agreed to complete the procedures and allocate the funds in Shanghai. However, because the National Bank had tight funds yesterday, it could not provide such a large amount of cash, so it temporarily allocated a portion first, and the rest will be collected by the schools within a few days.</p>
<p>In addition, the Executive Yuan allocated more than 400 million yuan in grain storage fees for the sixteen schools for three months, which was calculated at the market price of 17,000 yuan per dan at the time. Now that the price of rice has risen above the 20,000 yuan mark, using the funds to purchase grain will likely not reach the original figure of six dou per person.</p>

<h3>Senators Request Recall of Order for Public Utilities to Be Priced in Customs Gold Units</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In opposition to public utilities being settled in Customs Gold Units, City Senator Zhang Zhongyuan sent a letter to Mayor Wu, requesting a recall of the order. The original letter roughly stated: "Customs Gold Units" are a currency for taxation, and the Ministry of Finance stipulates that they are only applicable for calculating customs duties. After public utilities use Customs Gold Units as an adjustment calculation standard, rents and prices can be used as an excuse to follow suit, and the Gold Yuan is equivalent to being nominal. I hope that the order will be recalled to save the people's hearts.</p>

<h3>Liu Shan Kang and Two Others Sued for Forging Checks to Purchase US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Businessman Liu Shan Kang and Tang Mingzhong knew Chen Kun. One afternoon in January this year at 3:30 PM, Bai Tong Tang Mingzhong approached Chen on the pretext of purchasing US dollars. Through Tang's introduction, he handed over a forged 1,080,000 Chongqing Commercial Bank check to Chen and purchased 3,000 US dollars. Because Chen had to deliver the goods the next day, in addition to being defrauded of the change due, he lost 14,000 yuan in cash, a check for 96,000 yuan from the East Asia Bank, a check for 10,000 yuan, and a security deposit of 960,000 Gold Yuan. Chen held the check to the Chongqing Commercial Bank to check the authenticity of the check and was detained by the bank clerk and sent to the police station. However, because Chen had a security deposit, he colluded with his classmate Nan Xuemin, claiming that Ang Zijian was the original owner who purchased the US dollars, alleging that he was defrauded of 600,000 Gold Yuan. After being transferred to the local prosecutor's office for investigation, it was believed that Liu Shan Kang, Tang Mingzhong, and Nan Xuemin were guilty of forging valuable securities and were prosecuted according to law.</p>

<h3>Frauds Abound, Intercepting Cars to Swindle Poplin, Six Gangsters Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Yifeng, the assistant manager of the Yongchun Cotton Cloth Store at No. 16, Lane 229, Zhejiang Middle Road, suddenly had Chen Yongming, whom he knew, come to the store at around 10:00 AM on the 26th of last month to purchase fifty bolts of striped poplin. He immediately gave a postdated check for 1,450,000 Gold Yuan and asked Zhou to help deliver the goods. He hired two rickshaws, each loaded with 25 bolts of poplin. Each rode one of the vehicles. Chen's rickshaw was in front, and Zhou's rickshaw followed behind. When the rickshaws reached the intersection of Caishi Road and Fuxing Middle Road, a young man named Wang Naixiang suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, deliberately intercepted Zhou's rickshaw, tore his gown, and argued with the rickshaw puller. At that time, Chen's rickshaw in front was nowhere to be seen. Fortunately, Zhou had been vigilant beforehand and had written down Chen's rickshaw number, 1377. Suspecting that Wang was colluding with Chen to commit fraud, he called the police, who took them to the Songshan Road Sub-Bureau and transferred them to the Laozha Police Bureau. After questioning by officers Li Minsheng and Tang Zhiliang, Police Chief Liu Zongtong immediately ordered police officers Miao Dejin and Shen Yanjun to investigate. It was found that the rickshaw puller with number 1377 was named Wu Yinggui. He was found and interrogated. According to his statement, the passenger ordered him to go to the entrance of the Jindu Theater on Foch Road and transferred to another rickshaw with another person. Later, the investigating police officers learned that the rickshaw number was 1070 and the puller's name was Xu Jinxiang, who lived at No. 8, Lane 154, Yongjia Road. He was found and brought to the bureau for questioning. He confessed that he had gone to a cloth stall at the intersection of Julu Road and North Zhongzheng 1st Road to unload the goods. The next day, the police officers disguised themselves as customers and secretly investigated the cloth stall, and as a result, they found five stolen goods. The vendor's name was Xu Changgen, and he was arrested. Xu led them to the home of his accomplices Xu Jinliang at No. 76, Jinxian Road, and Xu was also arrested. Xu led them to the Rundachang Cotton Cloth Store on South Zhongzheng 1st Road, where they found ten stolen bolts of striped poplin. Then they went to No. 45, Maoming South Road, Hengmaohe Sauce Garden, and found ten stolen goods. Finally, they went to Room 208 of the Lushan Hotel on Julu Road and arrested the principal offender, Chen Yongming. Based on Chen's confession, accomplices Zhang Liansheng and Yu Junhou were also arrested. They all confessed to colluding to commit fraud (including Wang Naiping). They also confessed that on January 15, they used the same method of issuing bad checks to defraud Jiang Yaping, the manager of Tianfengtai Cotton Cloth Store at No. 15, Guanghua Lane, Ningbo Road, of forty bolts of floral broadcloth and two bolts of Qilichou. Later, the victim, Jiang Yaping, was summoned to the case to testify, confirming that he had been defrauded and harmed by Chen and others, and requested severe punishment according to law.</p>

<h3>Striving for Heavy Industry: Yang Jihui's Unwavering Dedication for Fifteen Years</h3>
<p>— Cui Mofei</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with the history of the rise of heavy industry in the Southwest cannot but admire Mr. Yang Jihui’s silent efforts and diligent spirit over the past fifteen years. Yang, whose given name is Fangyu, is from Feiyang, Sichuan, and a graduate of the third class of the Army University. He is the director of the Ordnance Factory No. ×××.</p>
<p>He leads this infant of heavy industry, an unprecedented undertaking in the Southwest. Amidst immense difficulties, he nurtured this child and contributed the utmost to the war effort. The hardships and suffering involved are beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Without Yang's extraordinary courage and patience, he would not have achieved today's success.</p>
<p>Looking Back</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, Liu Fucheng (from Hunan), a man with great ambition, saw the intense civil war in Sichuan. While weapons and ammunition could be manufactured locally to some extent, raw materials (steel) had to be imported. He decided to build a steel plant in Sichuan to solve the fundamental problem. At this time, he invited Yang Jihui, a self-motivated graduate of the Army University, to oversee this arduous task. They selected a factory site amidst layers of mountains, built the factory buildings, and immersed themselves in hard work. After Liu Xiang's death, Yang resolutely handed over this "mother" of heavy industry in the Southwest to the central government, which became the authority in the iron and steel industry in the Southwest, a metallurgical giant.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, this place was a barren and desolate wilderness. But today, one sees only rows of chimneys and densely packed houses, the deafening sound of machines "kissing" each other. "Where there's a will, there's a way," Yang Jihui smiled. Fifteen years ago, he brought a group of cadres here to build the factory. He personally supervised the construction, living and sleeping at the factory, dedicating himself to a desperate struggle. Gradually, he pieced together those outdated machines and installed them, entering the experimental stage. Mr. Xiong Tianzhi was hired to oversee smelting and engineering. This middle-aged man, who studied mining and metallurgy in France, always had a smile on his face, wearing a blue cloth gown, living with the workers all day long. Gradually, with Xiong's assistance, his Gesi steel was produced from the furnace, and everything progressed better than before. After the factory was taken over by the central government, it was under the jurisdiction of the Ordnance Department. After the war of resistance entered its second phase, the seaports were blockaded, and raw materials and machinery could not be imported. The Ordnance Department was an independent unit, and everything had to be self-sufficient. Only then did Yang gradually become valued, and he himself became even more vigilant.</p>
<p>The Unsung Hero</p>
<p>At that time, a group of people who had been sent to Germany at public expense by the National Resources Commission (NRC) returned to China after completing their studies. Because these talents had studied mining and metallurgy, the NRC referred them to Yang. In fact, this group of people were the key personnel who were sent to Anshan and Taiwan to take over after the victory, namely Yang Shutang, Li Songtang, and Mao Henian, whom Sun Yueqi regarded as Chinese metallurgical authorities. After graduating from a German university, Yang Shutang interned at the Krupp steel factory of the German steel trust for a period of time, and then returned to this troubled motherland. He was sent to this infant of heavy industry amidst layers of mountains to begin work. He saw that the factory's equipment was outdated and the technology was backward, but he was moved by the director's hard work and perseverance. Once, in his capacity as an engineer, he asked Xiong Tianzhi, the director of the engineering department at the time:</p>
<p>"Why does it take so long for us to make steel?"</p>
<p>"The equipment is not good enough!"</p>
<p>"I can do it in half the time."</p>
<p>"You—don't be kidding!" Xiong Tianshe laughed, a laugh containing much excitement and encouragement. He knew that these people wanted to show their skills, but his habits and experience told him not to make a rash decision.</p>
<p>"Okay! You try it."</p>
<p>All the senior technical personnel responsible for the Ordnance Department arrived, hoping to witness a miracle in the history of Chinese metallurgy. At the scheduled time, sparks flew, and the heat was intense. The steel came out of the furnace and was sent to the chemical analysis department for testing. Everything met the standards in terms of ductility and hardness, but the time was reduced by half. Immediately afterward, Li Songtang pieced together a 28-inch rolling mill from machinery that had been removed from the Hanyang Arsenal and was considered scrap.</p>
<p>Qi Yun, who had earned a German national doctorate and had a clean face and gentlemanly demeanor, solved the problem of refractory materials that had not been solved in the history of Chinese metallurgy for decades. At that time, the refractory bricks used in steel furnaces had to be purchased in the United States and transported across the ocean via the Hump airlift. If the weather was bad and the plane was delayed, work had to be stopped to wait for the continuation of the material transportation. Qi Yun used some waste materials to make refractory bricks, which were as effective as those made in the United States, but the price was only one percent of theirs.</p>
<p>Without him, the heavy industry in the Southwest might have been delayed for another ten years.</p>
<p>Perseverance and Hard Work</p>
<p>When he turned fifty, the entire factory's staff had followed him for almost ten years, and everyone decided to hold a celebration. When this idea was conveyed to him by the workers' representatives and another senior staff member, he refused this kindness with a cold enthusiasm, saying:</p>
<p>"Don't forget what time it is now. The suppression of the rebellion is in full swing, and the front line needs more and more supplies. We should be stepping up production. I appreciate everyone's pure motives, but I reject this kindness." At this time, the vast masses of workers did not accept his opinion. They believed that if the director did not accept this suggestion, it would be tantamount to admitting that there was no emotional connection between him and the workers. The fire-like enthusiasm finally overwhelmed Yang's cold emotions. In a helpless mood, he accepted a souvenir, a pair of paper couplets.</p>
<p>In the thirty-first year, the enemy constantly bombed this only metallurgical equipment in the rear. Since air defense equipment could not be talked about, it had to be bombed. The number of bombings was too high, so the enthusiasm for rescue was also reduced. In one instance, when the factory was hit by incendiary bombs and fires broke out everywhere, he personally took the water hose to put out the fire, saying: "These things were all bought with the people's blood and sweat. Do you know what state the war of resistance would be in without these things?" He used a faint, non-aggressive voice, unwilling to be persuaded by others, and regardless of his own safety, he risked his life to rescue the machines.</p>
<p>Now, his wife has passed away. He lives in the factory every day and eats with the workers. He has no small kitchen, let alone a private cook. Perseverance and hard work—this is Yang Jihui's personality.</p>
<p>A Touching Story</p>
<p>After my fourth visit to the factory, I couldn't forget a heart-stirring story that was circulating among the vast masses of workers. Cui Zhixiong, a tall, gaunt, middle-aged man from Anhui who spoke fluent Sichuan dialect, was one of Yang's key cadres, following him for more than twelve years. He served as Yang's administrative secretary, capable of writing poetry and prose, a large brush calligraphy, a half bottle of old wine, capable and arrogant, with courage, but not good at ingratiating himself, claiming to be an honest official with character. Because of the salary issue, the Ordnance Factory had a relatively large welfare organization to solve the problem of workers' lives and daily necessities. When the previous director resigned, Yang ordered this veteran cadre to come out and shoulder this heavy responsibility. On the day he took office, he said to his subordinates in a very firm tone: "...From now on, we must resolutely change the problem of 'not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality.' Even if it is only a very small amount of something, we must ensure that everyone gets a little bit."</p>
<p>During the great bombing, he put on straw sandals and supervised the workers to rescue materials. At that time, the Ordnance Factory worked ten hours a day, but he often went at seven in the morning and didn't leave the office until nine in the evening. Two sesame cakes at noon were his lunch. During the war, the authorities allowed the workers' staple food to be allocated from the military grain, but the procedures for領取 were quite troublesome, so that it could not be received on time, and the poor quality of the rice was also an unavoidable fact. So a group of workers who were instigated went to his home to question him. At that time, he was having dinner, and his rice bowl contained a bowl of low-priced eight-treasure rice mixed with sorghum chaff and sand, with a bowl of boiled cabbage with no oil in the middle. It turned out that everyone, from the director to the small workers, ate this kind of rice, with no difference.</p>
<p>His approach convinced everyone and made them silently retreat. At this moment, one of his favorite children, because he was usually busy with official duties and neglected him, suffered from acute pneumonia. The doctor's diagnosis required a not insignificant sum of money. A very trusted clerk suggested to him that he withdraw a part of it from the public funds and slowly return it later, but he refused Huan Liangmei's kindness, saying: "Thank you, Ji, but I would rather let my child die than do such a selfish thing." The concept of 清廉節操 still occupies a not small place in his heart.</p>
<p>Bless Yang Jihui</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yang Jihui went to various places in the East to visit, as a mirror for the expansion of the factory in the future. This inspection really made him feel mixed emotions. His own industry was too backward. The only thing he could be comforted by was that he had retained a group of talents for the country. Wherever there is heavy industry, there are Yang's old subordinates. Yang himself has been in charge of the metallurgical industry for fifteen years. With his spirit of diligence in learning, humility in asking questions, he seems to be able to squeeze into the ranks of experts today. After seeing the heavy industry in Taiwan, Shanghai, and the Northeast, he wrote a lecture draft of more than ten thousand words, pointing out the areas where metallurgical industry technology should be improved. He believes that during this suppression of the rebellion, the demand for military supplies has increased sharply, but he does not approve of increasing workers. He believes that technical talents should be few and of high quality. Rather than increasing workers, it is better to find ways to increase worker efficiency. Rather than waiting for US aid and reparations materials, it is better for us to do it ourselves first. He sincerely hopes that he can supply the industrial steel for the southwest in the future, and at the same time, he hopes that the by-product factory can also step up production, so that 洋釘鋼絲 and the like will not be in short supply in the southwest.</p>
<h3>Today's Zhejiang: Material Utilization Conference</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>We should question the Zhejiang Material Utilization Committee: What are the benefits to the local area after using the materials? How much effect has been achieved on the improvement and production of materials?</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou 3rd dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Material Utilization Committee was founded when Chen Gongzhi was in charge of Zhejiang. This Material Utilization Conference is the embodiment of the material production control and sales committee of Chen's rule in Fujian, the Monopoly Bureau of the rule in Anhui, and the material adjustment committee. The original intention was because the provincial finances were insufficient, and the deficit was huge, and it was only possible to maintain it with the help of the central government, and there was no money left to handle emerging businesses, so the Material Utilization Committee was established to exchange materials or money from Zhejiang Province with other provinces to run businesses. The so-called material utilization, as we look at the words, should not only concentrate and control the export of materials, but should also have the task of improving materials. Only by making Zhejiang Province's materials tend to be excellent and standardized can we obtain the faith of other provinces, and then be happy to purchase and store Zhejiang Province's materials.</p>
<p>Business without Capital</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Material Utilization Conference, Chairman Ren Xianqun said with a smile: "This is doing business without capital." Indeed, the Zhejiang Provincial Material Utilization Conference did not spend Zhejiang's administrative expenses, and was completely self-reliant. They tried their best to establish contact with the central financial and material institutions, first starting with purchasing Zhejiang's special products on behalf of others to establish credit, and then negotiated with the Central Bank to allocate a part of the working capital for their own use. They have already purchased 60,342 市担 of green ramie on behalf of the central government. Purchased and stored 31,180 市石 of food rice for the people (including 15,000 市石 approved to be priced for the Hangzhou Municipal Government and 440 市石 for the Zhejiang Salt Affairs Bureau, etc.), transported and sold 150,000 祖 of salt, exchanged for about 17,333 石 of Jiangxi rice, and purchased 73,514 large packages of 部糧購起糙米 and 21,219 石 of paddy rice on behalf of the Ministry of Food. Purchased and stored 520 担 of rapeseed oil and more than 180 祖 of rapeseed cakes, and purchased 156 担 of cotton. At present, the association's surplus in kind is more than 48,000 石 of rice, more than 93,000 担 of salt, and more than 500 担 of edible oil, with a total current value of 金圓500 million yuan. The numbers are not insignificant, but in this first session of the fifth meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly, Feng Wenqi, the acting chairman of the Material Utilization Committee, was severely criticized by the provincial assemblymen. And this time of questioning was also the most tense and enthusiastic one. They said that the Material Utilization Conference was competing with the people for profits, saying that it was using its power to forcibly purchase the grain stocks of various counties. But according to Commissioner Feng, "Operating under the principle of absolutely not competing with the people for profits, the Material Utilization Committee has not borrowed power. The grain stocks in various counties were originally surplus and needed to be sold, so it cannot be said to be forced." After the provincial assemblymen had a fierce debate, some advocated abolishing and liquidating the Material Utilization Conference. According to what the reporter knows, Zhou Fengzhang, the newly appointed chairman of Zhejiang Province, believes that the provincial treasury is insufficient, and the Material Utilization Conference can indeed enable Zhejiang Province's finances to obtain turnover, so there is no intention to abolish it.</p>
<p>Increased Production? Shrinkage</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Material Utilization Committee we hope for not only concentrates and controls the export of materials, but also improves the materials and invests a part of the external sales into the original production business, so that production can continue to increase due to the relationship of the Material Utilization Committee, and not shrink due to the relationship of the Material Utilization Committee. Among the main businesses that the Zhejiang Provincial Material Utilization Conference has already handled, we know that they can be divided into purchasing and storing grain, purchasing and storing edible oil, and purchasing and selling green ramie and cotton. Today, the grain problem is indeed a very important problem, and storing grain for emergencies is also a matter of course, but when purchasing grain, we must have an understanding that the countryside has reached a state of decline and exhaustion. The surplus of grain stocks in the county is originally purchased cheaply by local influential people. Now that we are purchasing for the business of the entire Zhejiang Province's public, we may as well discuss with the county-level merchants to increase the price slightly higher than the original county's selling price, and use the higher amount to run rural businesses. The same is true for edible oil. When we purchase rapeseed, we should propose a certain amount of money as improvement funds. When rapeseed is used to extract oil, we should also propose a certain amount as the improvement cost of this oil extraction factory. The same method applies to green ramie and cotton.</p>
<p>Visit Production Areas for Investigation</p>
<p>The Material Utilization Conference should send personnel to visit the production areas at any time. The improvement and enhancement of rural life and production should be made into investigation forms as the basis for the quantity purchased in the next year, and it can also be seen that the export and utilization of materials has continuously increased production, and invisibly increased the wealth of Zhejiang Province. In today's Zhejiang, the items currently purchased and stored by the Material Utilization Conference are naturally very easy to generate profits. The Material Utilization Conference should go a step further to seek the prosperity of Zhejiang's special products, such as silk, tea, and tung oil, which are about to decline, which will be of greater benefit to Zhejiang's future. We believe that the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly should not support the Material Utilization Conference as competing with the people for profits, but should ask what are the benefits to the local area after the Material Utilization Conference uses the materials? How much effect has been achieved on the improvement and production of materials? And the Material Utilization Conference should not just focus on the success of the two sides' buying and selling in the form of an intermediary merchant, but should seek to find out what is the impression of this material export, and how to supervise the origin to improve, so as to obtain the faith of the sales area?</p>
<p>Future Business</p>
<p>Of course, the Material Utilization Committee contains the nature of public sales and the nature of centralized transportation and sales, but its centralized transportation and sales and public sales are operated by the public, and its profits can be returned to the public. However, if we ignore the active improvement of products when implementing centralized transportation and sales, the future of centralized transportation and sales will also be very bleak. We hope that the future business of the Material Utilization Conference should further strive for the outward sales of Zhejiang's special products.</p>

<h3>Ensuring the Northwest Gateway: A Dispute Between a Soldier and the People May Cause Ethnic Problems in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>— Xie Zaisan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Last year, I led the National Northwest University's Frontier Administration into various parts of southern Xinjiang, a round trip of 20,000 li, lasting four months. Upon my return, many friends asked me about the situation in Xinjiang and my impressions of the trip. Due to time constraints, I could not answer them one by one, so I have drafted this article to seek correction from those who care about the Xinjiang issue.</p>
<p>Importance in National Defense</p>
<p>Xinjiang is the largest province in our country, with an area of 1,641,554 square kilometers, about four times the size of Sichuan, eight times that of Hunan, and fifteen times that of Zhejiang, approximately the sum of the areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Suiyuan provinces. This vast area has unfortunately not been given attention by people in the interior. Such magnificent land is abandoned in the border regions, with no one caring about it! Let us look at the current state of our border areas: The Northeast is still in turmoil, Outer Mongolia has already become independent, Tibet is half-attached and half-detached, and what about Xinjiang? We have already seen that the northwestern corner of Xinjiang—the Yili, Tacheng, and Altay regions—has become special. How will we ensure the northwest gateway? This is a question that every Chinese person should be concerned about. Xinjiang borders Central Asia and has always been coveted by Britain and Russia, making it strategically important in national defense. Speaking of this, we might as well look back at history. Since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sent Zhang Qian to the Western Regions, it was a diplomatic strategy implemented to increase national defense capabilities, with the aim of attracting the allegiance of the Wusun and Dayuezhi countries to cut off the right arm of the Xiongnu. As a result, thirty-six countries within the Western Regions became affiliated, which was a great success at the time. During the reign of Emperor Ming of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Ban Chao entered the Western Regions and subjugated more than fifty countries, which was interrupted and resumed several times. During the Tang Dynasty, the Western Turkic Khaganate was pacified, and its territory was used to establish loosely governed prefectures, with the number of prefectures reaching several hundred. The Anxi Protectorate (in present-day southern Xinjiang) and the Beiting Protectorate (in present-day northern Xinjiang) were established, with heavy troops stationed there for management. The prosperous eras of the Han and Tang Dynasties all regarded the Western Regions as an important national defense stronghold. After the Qing Dynasty pacified the Dzungars, it established governors, ministers, counselors, and captains to govern the area. It was not until Zuo Zongtang pacified the Hui rebellion that Xinjiang was officially established as a province in the eighth year of the Guangxu reign, treating it as part of the interior. From then on, Xinjiang truly belonged to China, and our country's northwest national defense truly extended to both the northern and southern routes of the Tianshan Mountains.</p>
<p>The importance of Xinjiang's position in national defense was such in the past, and it is even more important now. The military authorities currently responsible for Xinjiang are also very clear about this. They understand that Xinjiang is the northwest gateway of China. If Xinjiang is lost, everything outside Jiayuguan will no longer belong to us, and the entire Northwest will also enter the horror of destruction. We have heard several military officers in charge say that their will to defend the territory is very firm, and they all said that not an inch of Xinjiang's land can be lost. This is correct. We must not take such an important place lightly.</p>
<p>What is the current situation in Xinjiang? I will now describe it as follows:</p>
<p>Political Democratization</p>
<p>Politically, Xinjiang has implemented political democratization. All commissioners and county magistrates in the province are elected by the people. Today, the interior has not yet implemented the election of local administrative officials, but it has already been implemented in remote Xinjiang. Those elected commissioners and county magistrates may be somewhat unskilled in administrative techniques, and the efficiency of their work may not meet the standard, but these public servants elected by the common people are indeed doing things and not being officials. They do not have any bureaucratic habits. Any county magistrate can talk to the common people as casually as ordinary people, and there is no separation between superiors and subordinates. In southern Xinjiang, we saw a county magistrate chatting with the common people at the gate of the county government, and his clothing and attitude were not at all like a bureaucrat. This made us, who are used to seeing county magistrates in the interior "ruling the country" and acting high and mighty towards the county people, feel strange. This one example shows that Xinjiang's politics is progressing upward. Because the county magistrates are elected by the people, most of the county magistrates are Uyghur. In southern Xinjiang, we only encountered three Han Chinese county magistrates, but their deputy county magistrates were still Uyghur.</p>
<p>The direction of provincial administration has already been explained. We have heard various opinions in Xinjiang. Although what they say is different and their positions are also different, their conclusions have gradually converged. Xinjiang has its own path and does not need to be the same as the interior.</p>
<p>Unity of All Ethnic Groups</p>
<p>The various ethnic groups in Xinjiang are gradually becoming more united. During the Sheng Shicai era, the ethnic groups in Xinjiang were divided into fourteen types. This division is now mostly considered inappropriate, so there is also the theory of dividing them into Turkic language family, Mongolian language family, and Chinese language family. This standard of classifying ethnic groups by language is more scientific, but because of this, the Turkic language family ethnic groups have become even stronger. The Turkic language family ethnic groups include Uyghur, Kazakh, Tatar, Taranchi, Tajik, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek, accounting for 80% of the total population of Xinjiang. In the past, we had a tradition of wanting to call the ethnic groups in the border areas as having the same origin as the Han ethnic group, sharing the same ancestors. There are constant records of this in our history books. In fact, this is very far-fetched. The combination of ethnic groups is not that simple and does not need to be forced. The existence of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang is a distinct fact. Of course, we cannot deny that Xinjiang is not an ethnic group. Speaking of the overall situation, there is no irreconcilable contradiction between ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province. It seems that Uyghurs and Han Chinese are opposed to each other. However, the incidents that have occurred in Xinjiang Province have mostly been the evil consequences caused by poor politics. Political incidents turn into ethnic struggles, and ethnic struggles cause diplomatic disputes. This seems to be a trilogy, forming an inextricable bond. Now, the Xinjiang Provincial authorities have seen the crux of the matter, so they are putting special effort into this area, striving to make politics enlightened and ethnic groups united. In the interior, a dispute between a soldier and the people is just a matter of discord between the military and the people, which is not a big deal. However, in Xinjiang, if a soldier quarrels with the people, it may cause an ethnic problem. We once saw a Han Chinese military officer quarreling with a Uyghur merchant on the streets of Kashgar. The officer raised his hand and beat the Uyghur merchant. At that time, the Uyghur merchant publicly announced, "What kind of army is this? Are the Han Chinese oppressing the Uyghurs like this?" This led to estrangement between ethnic groups. Such small things, accumulated over time, become resentment, and when the opportunity arises, the ethnic resentment will erupt. We once held a cultural symposium for young people of all ethnic groups. They all unanimously emphasized that all ethnic groups in Xinjiang should strengthen unity, and the way to unity is to respect each other's customs, religions, languages, and lives. This is a logical argument, and only in this way can all ethnic groups live together in peace.</p>
<p>People's Lives are Quite Good</p>
<p>At present, the people's lives in Xinjiang are relatively stable. The social order is good, and the living standards are also relatively prosperous. Especially in the southern Xinjiang area, the climate is mild, and agricultural products are abundant, with no shortage of food. This prosperous scene can be seen from the supplies of the garrisoned troops. The food for the troops stationed in the northern part of Xinjiang is transported from Gansu (in order to reduce the burden on the people, food is transported thousands of miles). However, the food for the troops stationed in the southern part of Xinjiang is raised locally. The soldiers are well-nourished, and each meal has meat, which is not easy to obtain for the troops stationed in the interior. The national troops we encountered all said that they ate well there and that their clothing was quite neat. For example, in the garrison in Baicheng, each soldier has a pair of riding boots, which are originally products of their own tannery.</p>
<p>Kazakh and Uyghur Ethnic Groups in Northern Xinjiang</p>
<p>The Kazakhs in northern Xinjiang live a nomadic life. Cattle and sheep roam the fields, carefree, and free to live and multiply, living a leisurely life. In Tianchi, we visited a Kazakh family. Their attitude toward life is that they do not worry about scarcity. Melons and fruits are everywhere, which is rare in the interior. The lives of Kazakh and Uyghur compatriots are so good, and the same is true for Han compatriots. Most Han Chinese live in cities, and public service and business are their constant occupations. Because the local area is stable, life is not as poor and miserable as compatriots in the interior who are constantly in the midst of war. At a minimum, they can maintain a family of five. Han Chinese who are engaged in agriculture in northern Xinjiang are not subject to crop failures, and their lives are better than those of farmers in the interior. Cities and villages have a prosperous atmosphere. It is unexpected that in our country, which is full of war, there is still such a quiet place.</p>
<p>Rich Resources Buried Underground</p>
<p>Xinjiang's rich resources are not on the surface but underground. According to preliminary investigations, the reserves of coal, iron, and oil rank first among all provinces in the country. This is just a preliminary investigation. Of course, there are many undiscovered mineral deposits. We saw a large coal mine near Yanqi, where the coal seam was exposed on the ground, but no one cared about it. The oil in Kuche and Kashgar is inexhaustible, and the locals refine and use it using indigenous methods. Gold mines can be mined at any time, and people say that gold can be mined somewhere. Iron ore is available everywhere. Yingjisha and Kuche have been famous for producing knives since ancient times, that is, their local iron is produced and they have very good steelmaking handicrafts. Between Wensu and Baicheng, there is a salt mountain, hundreds of miles from east to west and 200 meters high, which is entirely a salt mountain. When we went to visit, we saw this salt mountain and felt that Xinjiang is always endless treasure. Isn't this a good foundation for building a chemical industry in Xinjiang? This salt mountain is inexhaustible. The abundance of mineral deposits in Xinjiang shows that this place is suitable for developing heavy industry. We expect the country to have a way to quickly develop this "uncultivated virgin land." If the border is safe, the national defense will be secure.</p>
<p>Development of Culture and Education</p>
<p>Xinjiang is most suitable for developing culture and education in a stable environment. Newspapers and magazines in the interior can also be seen in Dihua, and the Northwest Cultural Construction Association is particularly committed to the construction of Xinjiang culture, publishing various publications related to Xinjiang. These developments in modern culture are certainly worthy of praise, but the inherent cultural life of the various ethnic groups is even more amazing. Uyghur compatriots are good at singing and dancing. Regardless of gender or age, they can all express their artistic talents. We saw the singing and dancing of young girls and the dancing of eighty-year-old men. When a five-year-old child performs a solo dance, he wins a round of applause.</p>
<p>Hometown of Singers and Dancers</p>
<p>Miss Cambarah, who is famous in the interior, is not a top-notch talented singer and dancer in Xinjiang. Southern Xinjiang is known as the hometown of singers and dancers. Every time the "Lang Yuanzi" season comes (summer, when walnuts are ripe, every family holds a garden dance party, commonly known as Lang Yuanzi), we can see the colors of true fruit country culture, which are beautiful, happy, and express the joy of men and women living in the oasis. We once saw a song and dance performed by a Miss Pacha Khan in Yisu. She was only sixteen years old and studying at a normal school. With graceful dance and melodious singing, she is truly a talented singer and dancer. We are not saying that Uyghur songs and dances are only worth watching and listening to. We should pay more attention to the fact that these songs and dances are part of the actual lives of Uyghur compatriots. In their lives, if songs and dances are removed, it would be an unimaginable thing. True art cannot be separated from reality, and the artistic life of Uyghur compatriots is true life. We believe that in Xinjiang, we should do our best to promote the cultures of all ethnic groups and supplement them with education, so that the education and cultural undertakings in Xinjiang will flourish.</p>
<p>Three Major Policies for Border Governance</p>
<p>In Lanzhou, General Zhang Wenbai once said to us that to solve the Xinjiang problem, we must first eliminate the past prejudices against the border areas, such as Han chauvinism or assimilation policies. He has analyzed in detail the mistakes of past border policies and pointed out the path to be followed in the future. His views are still the best policy for border governance today, but in the end, he sighed and said, "There are three ways to solve the Xinjiang problem at present: (1) Actively develop and promote economic and cultural development, so that Xinjiang compatriots can live a comfortable life. (2) If development is not possible, then let Xinjiang compatriots decide their own destiny, autonomy, independence, let them choose. (3) Maintain the border by force and strengthen national defense. Now, none of these three paths can be implemented: Firstly, the country has no money, how can it develop? Secondly, we are not willing to give up this great land casually. Thirdly, the country does not yet have this power. Then we can only maintain the status quo and wait for the future!" Zhang Wenbai's conclusion is correct, let us wait and see what the future holds. We feel that this place in Xinjiang needs the efforts of the Chinese people. Its future destiny will be determined by our national destiny.</p>

<h3>Gold and Silver Market to Resume After Implementation Rules for New Plan are Passed Market Organization May Follow Stock Exchange Model</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the issue of opening the gold and silver market, a related party revealed yesterday that the entire set of measures is still in Finance Minister Xu's pocket. It is said that the resumption of the gold and silver market is only a part of the implementation rules of this financial reform plan. The opening of the gold and silver market this time is obviously different from the method of selling gold during the Song Ziwen and Bei Zugi era, but rather to restore the gold and silver market that has been closed since August 13, so that gold, silver, and silver dollars can have a formal and public trading market. The organization of the market may follow the current stock exchange model. Members participating in market transactions must be recognized and qualified experts, and must pay a fixed amount of margin. Therefore, the operating and management rights of the market will be the responsibility of the private sector as much as possible. The financial authorities may send supervisors to the site for supervision in the same way as the current stock exchange. The related party emphasized that after the restoration of this open market, all transactions of gold, silver, and silver dollars will be able to operate in accordance with established and legal rules. The National Bank authorities will also be able to exert their open market buying and selling policies to stabilize the prices of gold, silver, and silver dollars. It is expected that after all the implementation rules are passed and implemented by the Executive Yuan, the gold and silver market in Shanghai will begin to prepare for restoration.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Fluctuations Narrow Market Situation is Weak in the South and Strong in the North Edible Oil and Miscellaneous Grains Struggle to Recover</h3>
<p>The rice market yesterday saw uneven strength and weakness in the northern and southern markets. In the southern market, due to slightly tight money supply, sentiment was very weak, and opening prices were slightly lower by 100-200 yuan. White japonica rice retreated to 19,400 yuan, and thin japonica rice to 19,500 yuan, each down 100 yuan. Early rice fell by 200 yuan to 19,200 yuan. White yuan and Yin yuan remained at their original prices. In the northern market, prices were slightly stronger due to high prices in the producing areas. White japonica rice rose by 200 yuan, and early thin japonica rice rose by 200-300 yuan each. A total of 7,742 piculs arrived in the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>After rising, it saw a pullback. In the early market, the upward trend continued from yesterday. Northern merchants continued to receive goods strongly, and military flour once rose to 8,650 yuan, and old car flour to a maximum of 9,150 yuan. In the later market, with the overall weakness of various items outside the circle, it was rumored that the Central Bank was secretly dumping goods, and sellers were very willing to sell. The market situation was unsustainable. Old car flour closed near the 9,000 yuan mark, and military flour closed at 8,400 yuan. Wheat bran also fell by 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Turned weak and fell. Only soybeans, under the rumors of the lifting of the export ban, foreign merchants came again to patronize. Car soybeans once rose to 18,000 yuan, but after hearing that oil cakes had turned flat, they retreated by 500 yuan. Raw peanuts initially fell sharply by 10%, but after foreign merchants inquired and soybeans became strong, they rebounded by 3,000 yuan. Other corn, red miscellaneous sesame, etc., fell by about 10% amidst the general decline of various items.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Fluctuated and declined slightly. Initially, due to the decline in rice prices, it also fell by 2-3,000 yuan. Soybean oil opened at 74,000 yuan, and in the middle market, it once rebounded to a high of 77,000 yuan. At the close, it fell again due to the decline in off-market prices. At the close, soybean oil was 74,500 yuan, a squeeze of 1,500 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell by 2,500 yuan, and Jilong's raw oil was stable. Soybean cake was flat and weak, with Changzi cake at 7,700 yuan and Lizi cake at 7,500 yuan. There were few buyers at the close.</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Association Requests Lifting of Southern Transportation Ban on Oilseeds</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the ban on the southern transportation of edible oil and its raw materials, it was previously expressly abolished, and then ordered to be banned again for one month. The deadline has now expired. The Miscellaneous Grain Association and the Oil Association believe that the edible oil and raw materials required in various parts of South China mostly rely on the Shanghai market for supply. Since the ban on transportation for several months, not only has the business of members been greatly affected, but they also feel that they are willing but not legally allowed to respond to the requests for assistance from various parts of South China. Now that the deadline has expired, the association and others jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Government today to consult the Jianghai Customs and quickly restore southern transportation to facilitate the flow of goods and benefit industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Money Supply is Steady with a Hint of Buoyancy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the money supply in the local market showed a steady trend with a hint of buoyancy. The interbank lending rate was between 70 and 80 yuan per day. The demand for funds was still very strong, and the supply was also abundant. Because the current interbank lending rate is too high, many merchants are willing to sell goods and lend out money for interest, and there is also a large supply outside the industry's banks.</p>
<h3>Exchange Bureau Yesterday's Transactions</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The National Exchange Bureau released $63,600,000 yesterday, while various banks involved in the large exchange put in $59,040,000. Foreign businesses put in $56,288,000, and various banks involved in the small exchange released $47,592,000.</p>
<h3>State-Owned Enterprise Stocks to be Listed Sequentially</h3>
<p>Following the Taiwan Sugar Corporation (台糖公司) stock and the 38th Year Gold Bond (卅八年黄金公債), stocks of state-owned enterprises such as the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) will soon be listed for trading. According to the responsible authorities, trading of Taiwan Sugar Corporation stock on the stock exchange has yielded good results since its listing. In order to strengthen the absorption of idle capital, the authorities are expediting preparations for the listing of Textile Construction Company and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stocks. Various tasks are gradually becoming concrete, and realization is expected in the short term. The 38th Year Gold Short-Term Bonds have already been listed and opened for bidding yesterday. In addition, the 36th Year Gold Bond will also be listed for trading soon. The successive listing of government securities has provided the government with another avenue for absorbing idle capital. In the future, the work of selling securities will be carried out simultaneously with the allocation of other materials, in a coordinated manner.</p>
<h3>Financial Institutions Applying to Use Capital; Financial Supervisory Authority Approves Two More</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Financial Supervisory Authority (金管局) continues to receive over forty applications from financial institutions applying to use increased capital funds. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the Bureau held its 17th routine meeting with the Audit Division of the National Bank Operations Bureau (國行業務局稽核處) to review each application. In addition to approving the use of funds for two financial institutions, totaling $300,000, the remaining applications were for extensions of deadlines.</p>
<h3>Loan Cases Approved by the Committee on Subsidies for Industry and Mining; Eight Cases Passed</h3>
<p>The Industry and Mining Advisory Committee of the National Bank's Discount and Loan Committee held its 32nd routine meeting at 3:00 PM on the 4th. More than twenty committee members attended, chaired by Cai Gongchun (蔡公椿). Eight loan cases were passed, including those for Chongqing Electric Power Company (重慶電力公司), Guilin Hydropower Plant (桂林水電廠), and E-Yi Coal Mine Company (鄂一用煤礦公司). After the meeting adjourned, the 15th routine meeting of the Production and Export Enterprise Loan Review Committee was held, chaired by Zhu Tongjiu (朱通九), and two loan cases were passed.</p>
<h3>List of Goods for This Year's Trade with Japan Submitted by China Trust for Review</h3>
<p>According to sources at the Central Trust Bureau (中央信託局), since the announcement of the Financial Reform Plan (財政金融改革方案), the government has been drafting a new trade plan with Japan in order to align with this new plan and promote the development of international trade, with the initial goal of expanding trade with Japan. The Central Trust Bureau has now compiled a list of goods that China can ship to Japan in exchange, and a list of goods that China needs Japan to ship to China, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (工商部) for review. Once approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, promotion can begin immediately. However, before the government's plan is finalized, no significant developments will occur in any business.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Skyrockets</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Tung oil market saw frantic buying activity, fueled by the frenzied rise of foreign exchange transfer certificates, frequently stirring excitement. Sellers seized the opportunity to raise prices, with the trend becoming increasingly sharp. While other commodities were leveling out, the Tung oil market repeatedly surged, setting a new benchmark.</p>
<h3>Gold Bonds Debut; Chinese Stocks Stagnant</h3>
<p>Gold bonds debuted yesterday. According to regulations, the opening price was $155,000, the high price was $170,000, and the low price was $150,000, with a fluctuation range of $20,000. The closing price in the morning was still $155,000. Most of the sellers were from banking circles, and most of the buyers were from the Guangdong community, with a total transaction volume of 628 taels. Because it was Friday, buyers had to bear two days of interest. The overall environment was calm, and new buyers hesitated due to concerns about high interest rates, resulting in a shrinking and stagnant market. There was little change in stock prices, and the amount of fluctuation was less than the previous day. Near the close, news of loosened credit and covering of short positions led to a rebound, but the market ultimately closed with flat and stable prices. New Asia (新亞) once reported a limit-up increase, and Zhenqi (振漆) also closed at the limit-up, with increases ranging from one cent to three dimes and five cents. Yongye (永業) rose four dollars. Fourteen stocks fell. Taiwan Sugar (台糖) suddenly reported a limit-down drop midway through the day, reflecting a reaction to its eleven consecutive days of increases, with a drop of $520. Other stocks also fell by a small amount, ranging from half a cent to one dime. The total turnover for the half-day reached 3.951 billion, including 112.5 million shares of Yongshen (永紗).</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>Gold bond trading takes place from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM daily, and the market is closed on Saturday afternoons. The half-day transaction volume was 281 taels, with a high price of $161,000, a low price of $157,000, and a closing price of $159,400. The sellers were still mostly from banking circles, and the buyers were mostly from the same industry.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Weaken</h3>
<p>The foreign stock market has turned from firm to weak. Credit in the circle was tight yesterday, major players retreated, and retail investors followed suit, resulting in a market roughly half a percentage point lower than the previous day. Yisha (怡紗) traded at $7,200, down $300 from the previous day. British &amp; Chinese Corporation (英聯) was also weak, trading at $7,700. Jardine Matheson (會德豐) saw no trades, and Asia Navigation (亞洲航業) traded at $700 and $720, down over $100 from the previous day. Other stocks generally fell by half a percentage point.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Coal Production Expected to Increase This Year</h3>
<p>According to visitors related to the Taiwan Coal Mining Industry Association (台灣煤礦業同業公會), last year's coal production in Taiwan was only 1.7 million tons due to repeated wind and flood damage. This year, it is estimated to increase to over 2 million tons. If various machines and the number of miners can be increased, production can be further increased. Currently, the export of Taiwan coal is still controlled by the government, and the annual quota allocated to Shanghai is over 50,000 tons, Guangzhou 13,000 tons, Xiamen over 1,000 tons, and Fuzhou 2,000 tons. This number is still insufficient compared to the actual needs of various regions. Efforts need to be made to increase it in order to promote trade between Taiwan and the mainland. As for Hong Kong, there has been no quota in the past. It is reported that the industry association hopes to exchange Taiwan-made coal for machinery or other materials needed by Taiwan to develop coal mines in Hong Kong, and is currently sending personnel to negotiate.</p>
<p>Coal Prices Rise Again</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The price of Keelung coal at the Four Mines Joint Operation Office (四礦聯營處) also rose yesterday due to the adjustment of the New Taiwan Dollar price. The new price is $65,920 per ton, up $3,670 from the old price. Other foreign bituminous coal remains unavailable and there is no market. White coal briquettes and grade ten remain at the original price.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trend Exuberant</h3>
<p>Since the continuous price increases in the city, yesterday's market sentiment was generally cautious, so attitudes were not as strong as in the past, and the rising trend stopped. However, the tea market was not restricted in the slightest, and instead, unanimously reached its peak, because the sellers felt that costs were rising sharply, and at the same time, they inherited the latent power of the previous day's rise, which was still insufficient, so they began to stir after opening, and gradually raised prices. By the close, prices had risen considerably. Transactions that had been sluggish for many days remained untransformed in the midst of protracted negotiations.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Fluctuation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market rose first and then fell back, with a slight increase at noon closing. No. 45 refined white sugar was $37,500, up another $500. Coarse granulated sugar was $36,700, also up $700. Xinghua (興化) white and red sugar, etc., all rose slightly by about $500 to $700. The industry had absorbed too much in the past few days and was saturated, but because dismantling interest rates were too high, holders held on, and transactions were flat in the soft market, with no significant gains or losses compared to the previous day's noon closing.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll: Watching Taiwanese Visitors</h3>
<p>Financial tensions between the United States and Britain: South Africa and Britain Take Advantage of the United States</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund stipulates that the world's pure gold price is US$35 per ounce. However, South Africa, a signatory country, recently specially produced gold with a slightly lower quality, and sold it at US$38.5 under the guise of gold products. South Africa's suzerain state is Britain, so South Africa's move was initiated by Britain.</p>
<p>The mainstay of the International Monetary Fund is the United States. The fund is vehemently opposed to South Africa's move, which is clearly instigated by the United States.</p>
<p>Since the victory over Germany, the open and covert struggles between Britain and the United States over currency and trade have intensified daily. This struggle is just one of many open and covert struggles.</p>
<p>In previous struggles, the United States sometimes won, and Britain sometimes won.</p>
<p>For example, in the beginning of the victory, Britain wanted to borrow gold from the United States, but the United States discounted it by 20% or 30%, and developed the Marshall Plan to aid Europe before lending it to Britain. This was a victory for the United States.</p>
<p>When the United States lent money to Britain and other European countries, it hoped that the currencies of various countries would be re-priced according to the black market exchange rate. Because the official prices of various countries were higher than the black market prices, this condition of the United States was intended to force various countries to devalue, shake the currency credibility of various countries, and further increase the control power of the United States' gold dollar diplomacy. Britain firmly opposed it, and the United States had to abandon this condition. This was a victory for Britain. This time, South Africa is selling gold at high prices, and the financial war between Britain and the United States has begun again. Although the consequences are not yet predictable, in the near future, the world's gold prices and international exchange markets will be greatly changed, and the general trend has been determined by this matter. Originally, Britain has the world's largest gold mine, and the United States has the world's largest gold reserves. Britain has more futures, and the United States has more spot goods. Britain is like a distant water that cannot quench a present thirst, so it is extremely poor. The United States can deliver spot goods immediately, so it can exert the power of its gold dollar diplomacy. This time, Britain's instigation of South Africa to sell gold at high prices is intended to step up gold mining and quench its current thirst. The United States opposes South Africa in order to ensure its own gold dollar diplomatic power.</p>
<p>South Africa's high-priced gold sales have implicitly lowered the value of the U.S. dollar, because the world's gold prices are calculated in U.S. dollars. In the past, the United States forced the pound to depreciate, but Britain refused. Now that Britain is attacking the value of the U.S. dollar, the United States will naturally fight back with all its might.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much the United States and the Fund oppose it, South Africa has its own reasons, because US$35 is the price per ounce of pure gold, and South Africa's selling price is gold coins with different fineness, so it does not admit that it is a breach of contract.</p>
<p>In fact, the price of pure gold is US$35; the price of mixed gold is US$38.5. South Africa's reason is equivalent to taking advantage of the United States. The United States and the Fund have been taken advantage of.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Initially Flat, Then Firm; Cloth Market Trend Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was initially flat, then firm. Sporadic transactions in the Guangdong community were not deserted, and most sellers remained optimistic. Buying interest was still weak, but most people in this street were watching. Especially with tight credit, buyers were worried, resulting in a rising market.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix (藍鳳) initially opened at $1.17 million, then rose to a high of $1.25 million, and finally closed at $1.24 million, up $60,000. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose $50,000, closing at $1.21 million. 32-count Silver Moon (銀月) opened at $850,000 and finally rose to $900,000, up $40,000.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse (雙馬) spot goods rose from $670,000 all the way to $720,000, closing at $700,500 at noon, up $25,000 from the previous day. Factory orders (廠單) were last traded at $670,000, and 20-count Double Horse was $655,000, also up $25,000. Other brands such as Golden City (金城) and Celestial Maiden (天女) also showed their beauty. 16-count Brightness (光明) broke the $600,000 mark, closing at $600,500, up $15,000. Other markets were firm and stable.</p>
<p>The cloth market presented a fluctuating situation, because after the peak of the previous day, new buyers were ultimately hesitant due to high prices, but major players, in view of the opening of transport to the south, were unwilling to sell easily, so prices were generally stable.</p>
<p>Dragon Head (龍頭) fine cloth opened in the morning at the same price as the off-market bid price in the afternoon of the previous day, at $30,750. Later, because general retail investors were cautious about rising prices and sold at high prices, it was ultimately difficult to resist the force, so they abandoned the $30,000 mark and gradually fell to $28,800, down $1,000 from the previous day. Loudspeaker Child (喇叭童) fine cloth fell slightly by $400, closing at $27,500.</p>
<p>In addition, B Dragon Head (Ｂ龍頭) and Five Blessings (五福) fine cloth also fell into the low range. Four Gentlemen (四君子) plain serge opened at $29,100, then rose to $29,300, and finally fell slightly to $27,200, down $1,000. Golden Lotus (金蓮) yarn serge fell $500. Most other cloths did not move. In the afternoon, because credit within the industry loosened, off-market bid prices rose back to the noon closing price of the previous day.</p>
<h3>China Textile Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] China Textile Construction Company (中國紡建公司) sold yarn yesterday as usual, offering nine types, totaling 48 pieces. 27 households were approved to purchase, with a value of $53,320,000.</p>
<p>The selling prices of various counts of yarn were: 8-count Sunlight (日光) $340,000, 14-count Water Moon (水月) $560,000, 32-count Sunlight $850,000, 32-count Double-Strand Harvest (雙股豐年) $1,100,000, 40-count Shebao Light (社寶光) $1,120,000, 42-count Double-Strand and 40-count Triple-Strand Red Treasure Light (三股紅寶光) both $1,150,000, 60-count Palace Maiden (宮女) $1,700,000, and 80-count Double-Strand TK Colored Ball (雙股ＴＫ彩球) $3,650,000.</p>
<h3>Timber Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>In the timber market, fir prices are firm and stable due to reduced supply, but the price increase of foreign goods still lags behind. Currently, fir is $120 per foot, foreign pine is $300 per foot, and Liu'an plywood is $1,900 per sheet.</p>
<h3>Silk Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's artificial silk market turned flat. The yarn and cloth market outside the industry was mediocre, and the gold and banknote market rose first and then fluctuated, and people were calm. Credit in the market was "slightly" looser yesterday, but market interest rates were still between 70 and 75. Holders of goods were cautious about high interest burdens. As a result, the market was mediocre. The 120-day bridge opened on the same-day position at 930,000 to 940,000. There was a strong intention to sell in the middle, and it once fell back, but after hearing that the gold price had softened and then strengthened, idle capital from outside the industry entered, and buying interest increased, and it closed at the million mark. In the afternoon, credit loosened, and off-market gold prices rose slightly with interest. The market was still stable, but because general prices had risen sharply in recent days, the trends of various industries were weak yesterday, and the large silk market was no exception, so bid prices rose slightly.</p>
<p>The raw silk market was quiet yesterday, and major players were mostly watching. Although credit had eased, hidden interest rates were not low, so digestion was weak. Superior grade was first traded at 1.2 million and then at 1.22 million, down 30,000 from yesterday afternoon. Grade D was 1.25 million, also down a small 30,000. The trends of other grades were flat. In the afternoon, there was not much fluctuation in various off-market goods, and the gold and banknote market also rose slightly with interest. The market was still flat. Grade D was quoted at 1.27 million to 80,000, and superior grade was quoted at 1.23 million to 40,000.</p>
<p>The opening trend of silk fabrics and quilt covers was still flat. The factory did not open any goods, and most of the market was arbitrage trading. Mayer (美亞) was first traded at $675,000. After opening, because dismantling interest rates were still high, retail investors mostly sold. The market once softened, falling as low as 630,000 to 640,000. Later, off-market gold prices fell and then rose, but ultimately fluctuated between 191,000 and 193,000, and the market trend was unlikely to improve. People in the industry were also mostly watching. It closed at $645,000 near noon, down more than $20,000.</p>
<h3>Joint Operation Office Initially Decides Exchange Rate for US Aid Cotton</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The US Aid Cotton Committee (美援棉花委員會) and the US Aid Chemical Yarn and Cloth Joint Operation Office (美援化紗布聯營處) held another joint meeting yesterday afternoon. Regarding the exchange rate for the third phase of US aid cotton, the technical team reported on the process of studying the exchange rate. Based on cost estimates from various sources, there were several options for the cotton poundage exchanged for one piece of 20-count standard yarn, such as 621, 624.5, 632, and 643 pounds. After serious discussion, it was generally decided to be 624.5 pounds, and it will be submitted to the technical team for review and approval this morning.</p>
<h3>Municipal Industry Publishes General Overview of Shanghai's Sulfuric Acid Industry</h3>
<p>Sulfuric acid is the most important basic industry, and its consumption reflects the prosperity of the entire industry. It is also closely related to agriculture and national defense. Electrification fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate and superphosphate, and explosives for national defense, all require mutual quantities of sulfuric acid. Other industries such as machinery dyeing and weaving, cotton spinning, underwear knitting, enamel, leather making, papermaking, copper materials, towel sheet finishing, bleaching and dyeing, and wool spinning all require large quantities of sulfuric acid. Perfumes, dyes, instruments, stationery, gasoline lamps, photography, plate making, hardware, nickel sulfate, chromic acid polishing, oil glue wood, camel wool pharmaceuticals, etc. require less sulfuric acid, and the monthly statistics require about 1,000 tons. As for those who use sulfuric acid as a raw material to manufacture hydrochloric acid, the monthly demand is uncertain. At most, it can reach 400 tons. At present, due to the sluggish industry, the total amount of sulfuric acid required should be less than 600 tons. Currently, there are four sulfuric acid manufacturers in Shanghai: Xinyue (新業), Zhonghua (中華), Tiangong (天工), and Jiangsu (江蘇). Xinyue uses the latest contact method equipment, and the results are very good. Tiangong is a self-designed contact machine, which is quite rare. Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory belongs to foreign merchants and uses the lead chamber method, which is relatively old. Although Zhonghua is a lead chamber method, it has a larger output. The annual production volume of the above four factories last year is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhonghua 3,600 tons (maximum production volume is 5,400 tons).</p>
<p>Jiangsu 1,360 tons (maximum production volume 2,376 tons).</p>
<p>Tiangong 720 tons (maximum production volume 836 tons).</p>
<p>Xinyue 1,530 tons (maximum production volume 4,032 tons).</p>
<p>The current production volume of the above four factories is a total of 7,210 tons per year, or about 600 tons per month. The maximum production volume is 12,638 tons, or about 1,000 tons per month, which is sufficient for the current needs of various industries in the city.</p>
<p>The raw materials for manufacturing sulfuric acid include pyrite and sulfur. The domestic production of pyrite is quite abundant, but due to unstable production areas and transportation difficulties, it cannot be as smooth as expected. The most abundant domestic sulfur is in Taiwan, but the quality is poor and the quantity is small, and it is necessary to rely on the supply of imported products. Xinyue and Tiangong sulfuric acid factories in this city use pure sulfur, and Zhonghua and Jiangsu use both pyrite.</p>
<p>The largest use of sulfuric acid is the manufacture of fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and superphosphate. Domestic fertilizer plants, such as Taiwan Fertilizer Company (合灣肥料公司), Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Plant (永利硫酸錏廠), and Post-War Relief Rural First Demonstration Factory (善後事業鄕村第一示範工廠), directly use the produced sulfuric acid to manufacture fertilizers. Sometimes the remaining sulfuric acid is transported to this city for use by various industries. According to domestic sulfuric acid plants, dozens of them are largest in scale and equipment in the Huludao Assets Committee Sulfuric Acid Plant (葫蘆島之資委會硫酸廠), which can produce 1,500 tons per month. However, due to the impact of the war, it is temporarily suspended. The sulfuric acid plant of Taiwan Fertilizer Company, although large in scale, has older equipment and can produce 350 tons of concentrated sulfuric acid and 300 tons of dilute sulfuric acid per month. However, the container problem has not been resolved, and it cannot be transported to Shanghai as much as possible, which is a pity.</p>

<h3>British Newspaper Praises Malayan Badminton Team</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 4th] The "Glasgow Herald" published an article by a sports reporter on the 2nd, reviewing the Malayan badminton team's performance in the Thomas Cup. Regarding the final against Denmark, the article said: "The rather arrogant Danish captain Skalup (史加洛普), i.e., last year's All-England singles champion, never recovered after his first defeat, and it was easy for Malaya, the victor of the International Badminton Championship, to win." Regarding the semi-final against the United States, it said, "The most outstanding features were the performances of Feliman and Lovette. Mantz's two glorious defeats at the hands of Huang Bingshun and Huang Defu, and the superb skills of Malaya's best doubles team Zeng Guanliang and Yang Decai were witnessed by 6,000 people on the court. The fierce battle between Malaya and the United States will be listed among the greatest matches in badminton history."</p>

<h3>Stimulating the Singapore Football Scene: "Disguised Amateurism"</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Singapore] A rather familiar pathology in the sports world has recently been discovered here, shaking the entire Singaporean football scene. Here, it is called "disguised amateurism."</p>
<p>Recently, a sports enthusiast, using the pen name "Open Door," wrote to the Straits Times, pointing out that the current pathology in the football world is a shocking fact that needs to be washed away with a surgical procedure. He said, ("Disguised amateurism" is indeed a fact, and is well known to football players and football club staff here). In addition, he also stated four stains in the football world to prove that the Singapore football world has indeed been invaded by germs.</p>
<p>(1) A player injured his muscles, so he asked a masseur to massage him. The actual massage fee was S$2 per session. After five sessions, he recovered, but the bill he issued was for a total of ten sessions, S$3 per session. So he had a profit of S$20 (each Singapore dollar is worth US$0.475).</p>
<p>(2) A player claimed to have an internal injury, so he asked a traditional bonesetter "Mr." to treat him, at S$5 per session, but when billing, he would bill his parent club S$20.</p>
<p>(3) Before the competition, a star player would express "pay the money, otherwise please face the facts," and the staff in the meeting, in order to make him perform his best, had to give him rich hospitality to seek his emotional harmony), so that he must have a good performance in the competition.</p>
<p>(4) Star players want to have star positions. In fact, each club is secretly fighting to see who can give the better players better positions.</p>
<p>The editor of the Straits Times made the following reply to this accusation:</p>
<p>Regarding the current epidemic in the Singapore football world, we express our deep sympathy to the letter writer, but we can also say a few more pieces of evidence, one of which is also considered the most suspicious, is the fact that someone once asked a certain number of players to send "retention fees" in the last session.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Police's Rotation Strategy: Air Force High Altitude Team Suffers Initial Defeat; Unfamiliar Field Leads to Missed Shots</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Capital Air Force High-Altitude Artillery First Regiment basketball team played against the Shanghai Police last night at the City Gymnasium. It was their first game in Shanghai, and the stands were filled with enthusiastic uniformed comrades. The Shanghai Police won with their fast-paced play, with a final score of 44-33. The halftime score was 25-17. The Shanghai Police were familiar with the court and had the upper hand throughout the game. The Air Force High-Altitude team's performance was not bad, but they sometimes paid too much attention to their form. Coordination and passing need improvement, and they missed many shots, probably due to unfamiliarity with the court. The team only had six players available last night, which was also a disadvantage. In contrast, the Shanghai Police team had many players and used a rotation strategy, appearing more energetic. Before the main game, there was a friendly match between Jianle and the Police Machinery team, which Jianle won 38-35.</p>
<p>The Air Force High-Altitude team's players were Ling Jinghuan, Chen Chaozhu, He Ronglu, Yang Baijiu, and Li Lijin. The Shanghai Police team's players were Wang Rongsheng, Shi Jiuquan, Fu Qixia, Wang Bowen, and Liang Yongbiao. After the start of the game, the Shanghai Police took the lead, with Yongbiao scoring a goal, Bowen scoring two free throws, and Jiuquan adding points, making it 6-0. The Air Force High-Altitude team quickly called a timeout. Ling Jinghuan started to get into the game, but the Shanghai Police added three more points. Chaozhu scored a free throw, and Bowen made long-range shots from both sides of the court with ease. At 5-18, Huang Jianguo replaced Baijiu for the Air Force High-Altitude team, and Chen Shensi and Sun Moxi replaced Rongsheng and Jiuquan for the Shanghai Police. Suddenly, the Air Force High-Altitude team's momentum increased, with Jianguo and Chaozhu pressing forward, turning the situation around. At halftime, the Shanghai Police led 25-17.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Police did not relax in the second half. Jiuquan scored, and the guest player Li Yujin responded in kind. Chen Chaozhu scored another goal. Yongbiao and Rongsheng returned the favor, each scoring two goals, making it 35-21, further extending their lead. The Air Force High-Altitude team had many shooting opportunities, but they failed to score because they were too focused on their form. The Shanghai Police replaced Bowen with Moxi, and the Air Force High-Altitude team replaced Jianguo with Baijiu. The Air Force High-Altitude team struggled to finish the game, and the guest team lost their first game with a final score of 44-33.</p>

<h3>Joe Louis Autobiography (2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Canglong</p>
<p>But when my stepfather took me to Detroit to study, things were different. My grades weren't even up to sixth grade, and I was one of the biggest students in the class. But after school, I worked part-time on an ice truck, earning a dollar a day. I often carried fifty to seventy-five pounds of ice up several floors, and I never worried about these heavy tasks. I thought it helped my boxing and made me grow. And I gave the money I earned to my family. In the evenings, I often hung out with a bunch of local ruffians on a street corner. We fought often, but not very seriously.</p>
<p>I dropped out of school because of my poor grades, but a teacher at the new school saw right away that it would be better to reshape my hands than my mind. And he was right. I learned to do carpentry work. I made good furniture, from small tables to bookshelves to cabinets. My family needed these things, so I took them home. Unfortunately, the American economy began to decline, and my stepfather lost his job. My mother had to go to the relief agency and stand in long lines to get some relief money for us each week. I kept track of this money, which totaled $270. Later, in 1934, I won $1,300 in the fight against Charlie Massera and paid back that $273 in one go!</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen, I began to be interested in boxing. In the school gym, I put on gloves like the other students. At that time, I thought that maybe I would become famous because of this. Every night, my classmates and I talked about the wealth of those boxers. A classmate, Mckinney, who was one or two grades above me, told me that if I participated in amateur boxing matches, I could get commodity checks worth seven to twenty-five dollars per match. Mckinney himself was the Michigan amateur lightweight champion.</p>
<p>At the time, I was still learning the violin, but after five or six lessons, I started skipping class. I used the tuition money to pay for amateur boxing fees. Eventually, this was exposed by my violin teacher. I told my mother: I want to be a boxer, I don't want to be a violinist. My mother didn't insist either. She often said that if any of her children wanted to do something in this world, she would work as much as she could to help us achieve our goals. Soon, I found a job at the Ford Motor Factory.</p>
<p>Around 1932, I first appeared in the amateur boxing arena. At that time, I weighed 168 pounds, and they wanted me to fight a white boy named Miller. Miller had attended the World Games and was very experienced. He knocked me down seven times in two rounds. This was the most times I had been knocked down in my boxing career. That night, I was sore all over and felt dejected. But I still got a seven-dollar check, which I gave to my mother.</p>
<p>This stage was tricky enough, but I was improving every day. In my two years of amateur boxing, the records show that I won forty-three times by knocking out my opponents, and seven times by points. But I also lost four games. My opponents in this stage were all second-rate. The bandages on my hands were used over and over again after several fierce battles, because I really didn't have the money to buy new ones. I didn't have boxing shoes either, so I had to make do with old tennis shoes. Also, I didn't eat well. My family had no connection to steaks and pork chops, which are essential for a heavyweight boxer, but they were too expensive. At most, I could only enjoy my favorite sausages.</p>
<p>In 1934, I won the Detroit lightweight championship. A man named Rothspan, who was very interested in black boxers, began to notice me. He told me that if I worked hard and lived a serious life, he would help me. So I studied with him. He took me to his house to live, woke up early and went to bed early, treated me very well, gave me a lot of clothes to wear, ate with me, and often helped me out, giving me five or six dollars a week. He bought me boxing shoes, making me feel comfortable everywhere, so I continued to dominate in the boxing matches that followed.</p>
<p>My last amateur boxing match was on June 12, 1934, in Detroit against Beaucho. That time, I defeated Beaucho in the first round. After that, I asked Rothspan if I could turn professional. He took me to Chicago and introduced me to Jack Blackburn, who was my coach in every fight for the next eight years. Almost everything I know about boxing was taught by him. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Guan Yuan, Silver Dollars, and Gold Yuan</h3>
<p>— Cao Zhi</p>
<p>The new prices for public utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and trolley cars will be calculated and charged in "Guan Yuan" starting in March.</p>
<p>"Guan Yuan" is still a new term that most people haven't heard of. They still think it's the old "Guanjin," which was only worth 20 legal tender yuan. However, this is not the case. This Guan Yuan is a big deal, originally worth forty US cents! So, to put it more clearly, it means that public utilities will be charged in Gold Yuan certificates converted from US dollars.</p>
<p>The reason for doing so is said to be to "avoid the impact of the devaluation of the Gold Yuan certificates." The statement is correct, of course, but it makes it difficult for public and private employees who only have Gold Yuan but no Guan Yuan.</p>
<p>At the time of the economic reform (referring to this time, I can't remember which time it should be), it was originally said that civil servants would be paid in silver dollars, which inevitably made the civil servants, who were already so hungry that their faces had turned green, dream of Yuan Datou, which could jingle and shine in the streets of Henan. But unexpectedly, as the days passed, this matter seemed to be no longer mentioned. What they received was not "silver" yuan, but still "gold" yuan—but unfortunately, it was followed by the word "certificate."</p>
<p>Water cannot be avoided, nor can electric lights. Trolleys, for the sake of eating, have to be taken. But money, it is to be "calculated according to the Guan Yuan." Holding a few Gold Yuan certificates that are devaluing every day, you have to go to the end of the month to pay for the Guan Yuan that stubbornly refuses to devalue. Our civil servants have to learn from some master magician to do it!</p>
<p>As I write this, I see a report in the fourth-day newspaper that a person in charge of the Gold Management Bureau told reporters that a small number of shops in this city are actually pricing goods in silver dollars. As such, "not only is there a suspicion of forcing customers to use silver dollars for payment, but it is also sufficient to hinder the currency system and disrupt finance, and should be strictly prohibited," and so on.</p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely! But what about public utilities? Isn't it openly and legally approved to sell their "goods" by pricing them in Guan Yuan? What price in silver dollars is only a "small number of shops", but what price in Guan Yuan is all public utilities! Isn't that "hindering the currency system and disrupting finance," and shouldn't it be "strictly prohibited"?</p>
<p>Moreover, silver dollars, whether they are large-headed, small-headed, dragon dollars, or boat dollars, are still Chinese money used by Chinese people; and what "Guan Yuan" is forty cents of foreign money. Isn't this even more "hindering the currency system and disrupting finance," and shouldn't it be even more "strictly prohibited"!</p>
<h3>Lobbying</h3>
<p>— Nanwu</p>
<p>Although the trend of lobbying is said to be very strong now, it has existed since ancient times. It was lively more than thirty years ago. Fortunately, everyone still remembers it, so there is no need to go into details here, so as not to be redundant.</p>
<p>But the foreigners also do the same thing. In May 1934, the US Senate was in session to discuss a rather important "Bankruptcy Act." At that time, there was a notoriously corrupt senator named Gray Wolf, nicknamed "Blue Fish." As soon as this public official saw that the bill was unfavorable to him, he joined forces with a senator named Flea Len to oppose it as much as possible. But despite all their talk, it was difficult to escape justice, and they suffered a series of miserable defeats. Seeing that it was about to be passed by vote.</p>
<p>At this time, Gray Wolf was anxious and came up with a plan. When it was time to vote, he began to debate endlessly. The speaker of the US Congress cannot stop speeches. Gray Wolf's purpose was to delay time, so he talked nonsense and rambled on about everything under the sun. Once he stood up, he spoke for three hours in a row. The other senators knew that he was deliberately making trouble, and no one bothered to listen to his nonsense. They couldn't help but "draw lots" and quietly slipped away. In a moment, Gray Wolf was the only one still talking loudly in the meeting place. Next to him, only his accomplice Flea Len was sitting and listening respectfully to the grand remarks. In addition, there was only Speaker Gibson.</p>
<p>At this time, Gray Wolf suddenly made a ruthless move. He said: "Okay, are there only a few of us left? Let's vote on this case"!</p>
<p>Speaker Gibson was so anxious that he lost his mind, but according to the US rules of procedure, the speaker could not suggest checking the number of attendees. It was clear that Gray Wolf could succeed in his plan.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at that time, a senator named Bai Qumen suddenly rushed in through the door, and someone was yelling at Bai Qumen behind him: "Quick, quick! Quickly request a check to see if the number of attendees is sufficient"!</p>
<p>Bai Qumen made a suggestion as usual, and Gibson was naturally overjoyed, but Gray Wolf was greatly disappointed. He was so angry that he said to the person behind Bai Qumen: "Okay, let's settle the score later"!</p>
<p>Who was the person behind Bai Qumen? He was the number one red person in the US Congress, Secretary Pipur, who was also one of Truman's most trusted confidants. This public official is good at lobbying to benefit the people. It cannot be said that it is a messenger, and it is also an example of "the moon is better in a foreign country."</p>
<h3>Yuan Shikai and His "Big Head"</h3>
<p>— Subei</p>
<p>"Yuan Datou" won the "Silver Dollar Champion", it is said to be indeed because of the sufficient silver content and good color. I have not tested Yuan Tou, so I dare not rashly praise him; but there are three facts that prove that the saying that Datou is authentic is roughly correct:</p>
<p>(1) According to the Central Mint, Datou has the best color among various silver dollars;</p>
<p>(2) The exchange price of silver dollars stipulated by the Communist Party of China's People's Bank is the highest for Yuan Tou;</p>
<p>(3) In recent months, some people have expressed deep doubts about Yuan Tou's value and have specialized in buying eagle dollars and small heads, but Datou has not declined slightly as a result.</p>
<p>If so, then Yuan Shikai, although he is already a decadent dross in the history of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai's head is increasing in popularity because of its authentic color and prestige. His deep popularity is exactly the same whether it is "north and south" or whether people are "left or right". The "boat dollars" that the government is rushing to build in large quantities today will be inferior to "Yuan Yang". Yuan Shikai's reputation has been ruined for 30 years, but unexpectedly, 30 years later, the silver dollars he mainly cast have authentic color and have a "hundred-year machine" effect. The "Yuan rebel" in the ground will probably secretly rejoice and raise his eyebrows and exhale; but when we look at it from the entire political and economic history, it is inevitable that we will have a feeling of "one generation is not as good as the next". Even if Yuan Shikai's rebellious deeds are obvious and have long been concluded, "Yuan coins" do not cut corners and do not reduce materials, but are very popular with the people today.</p>
<p>At least, in terms of casting silver coins, Yuan Shikai did not take the opportunity to "steal chickens" and exploit the people. Even Yuan Shikai, who was so absurd, quite understood the principle of leaving love to the people.</p>
<h3>A Mixture of Laughter and Tears</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>On the morning of March 1, A said to B, his neighbor who came to borrow the newspaper every day:</p>
<p>"Congratulations! Congratulations!"</p>
<p>"What is there to be happy about?"</p>
<p>"The newspaper has risen from sixty yuan to one hundred yuan, and you can save another one thousand two hundred yuan a month, shouldn't that be happy!"</p>
<h3>Birthday Candles</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>A dancer in the dressing room boasted to her companions about how lively her birthday was last night.</p>
<p>"Wow, that cake was so big and so beautiful! There were seventeen candles on it!"</p>
<p>"Seventeen?" her companion asked. "What, were you lighting them at both ends?"</p>
<h3>Reading Mr. Gong Zhan's Article "From Peace to Buddhist Warmth and Abstinence from Killing" Written for the Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>— Huang Xuanweng</p>
<p>Buddhist music enters hell, sincerely saving all living beings. Although the scriptures are subtle, I fear the world will be shocked. To present them in a plain way, they seem obscure but are actually clear. Good and evil are originally different, inevitably leading to struggle. Force cannot stop war, but rather moves the world's soldiers. Does literature value emptiness? Drawing water requires clarity. Who sacrifices himself to save the world? I belong to Mr. So-and-so. Mr. is a descendant of Anren, surpassing the indifference of the Supreme Being. Having fulfilled his aspirations in Buddhism, he does not count success or failure. Success is as heavy as Mount Tai, failure as light as a feather. Exerting oneself for the nation, making it a process of struggle. Dealing with matters with impartiality, analyzing principles with utmost sincerity. Looking at the blood on the battlefield, recalling the sounds of the slaughterhouse. We are all descendants of Yan and Huang, why must we emulate sea whales? The wall has been crossed for three years, leading the masses to call for peace.

<h3>The Way to Make Money</h3>
<p>— Oriental Jing</p>
<p>A man in our city was crushed to death by a car. He had neither insurance nor savings during his lifetime, leaving behind a widow who was three months pregnant, which was quite pitiful. But this young widow politely declined all assistance, she 2: I have a plan. When the child was born, she stayed in the best hospital in the city and received the best care. I asked her what kind of plan she had.</p>
<p>She said: "It's very simple. I sell a kind of lottery ticket, one US dollar each. I give half of the number of lottery tickets sold to the winner. I take half myself. Friends from Harlem helped me sell this lottery ticket, for a total of five thousand tickets."</p>
<p>"How do you draw the lottery?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Every person who buys a lottery ticket can guess a birthday. Whoever guesses the birthday that is closest to the birthday of the child I will give birth to in the future will win the prize."</p>
<h3>Quite Instructive</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>A certain ethnic group in South Africa has a law on speeches: Every speaker must retract one foot and perform the golden rooster independence posture as soon as he begins to speak. If his foot touches the ground, he must stop immediately and step down.</p>
<p>It seems that our National Assembly may also consider adopting it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Old Tales (1) - A Record of the Three Moves of the Racecourse</h3>
<p>— Gu Qi</p>
<p>The racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road and Ma Hoke Road covers hundreds of acres. If you look down from the chessboard of the International Hotel, you can see green grass, endless at a glance. In the center of the prosperous commercial area, leaving such an open space unused is really a pity. In the past, during the meetings of the Senate, it was said that it was also mentioned that a price would be offered to recover it, or that suburban land would be exchanged, and the original site would be changed into a public gathering and sports venue, but in the end, the money that was opened up was frightening, and it was abandoned.</p>
<p>The racecourse is organized by foreigners and has a board of directors, which was established in 1850. But at that time, the racecourse was not in the current location, but at the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, covering 60 acres, as a place for horse racing and ball games. People generally called it the "Old Park". In 1854, as commerce gradually developed, land prices in this area rose rapidly. Seeing that there was a profit to be made, the board of directors sold this land and bought another piece of land between Zhejiang Road and Tibet Road for horse racing. People generally called it the "New Park". Later, land prices in the surrounding area also rose, so it was sold again, and the racecourse was moved further west, which is the current racecourse. This was in 1862. Because of the large profits made from buying and selling twice, the land purchased for the last time was also much larger than the previous two times.</p>
<p>In his book "Miscellaneous Writings", Huang Mengwuan also has a passage about the racecourse at that time. He said: "Western merchants living in Shanghai have horse racing games in the spring and autumn seasons every year, closing the wide field at the west end of Dama Road, surrounded by fences for more than ten miles, planted with sand and soil, and fine grass is connected, endless at a glance. On the day, they stand on horses with bridles and brocade turns in one color, the conch sounds, and the horses run like flying, from three or four horses to more than ten horses. Every time they must run for three days. After the run, there are also flower flag frame games, and the viewers are like the sands of the Ganges, and the sisters of the teaching workshop, without exception, drive horse-drawn carriages and arrive in teams. The tourists seem to have met before, and they are not prohibited from talking to each other, it is truly a great pleasure." From this, one can also imagine how grand the occasion was at that time.</p>
