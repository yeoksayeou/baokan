<h3>總統頒令勗勉全國　完成安邦定亂重任　同德一心挽國運於危亡</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州八日電〕總統於八日頒佈命令，勗勉中央地方軍政人員及各級民意機構，一致奮起，上下同德一心，堅守立場，協助政府完成安邦定亂之重任。茲誌原令於后：「頻年以來，戰禍未弭，鋒鏑所及，往往擲資源於虛化，化城市為捕墟，馴至四民失所，餓莩載道，怨毒之聲，溢於宇內。夫我國人同屬黃帝子孫，黨派政見容有不同，民族利害應無二致。顧當抗戰結果，全國亟待蘇息之日，尙復兄弟圓牆，自相殘殺，事之痛心，寗逾於此！政府念國之艱難，憫民生之疾苦，倡導和平，於茲四月，委曲求全，無所不至，方期籰開誠佈公，相讓為國，何圖中共竟於中途提出其所謂國內和平協定八條二十四款，條件苛刻，等於逼迫投降，且復限期簽署，不容賀迴旋；政府不忍見甫經奠定民主憲政之基礎遽遭摧毀，水深火勢之人民重罹浩刧，乃復婉申正誼，冀其作最後之考慮，而中共恃其武力，竟於政府代表尙留平商談期間，卽行強渡長江，申言將澈底擊潰政府軍隊。政府以和談無法繼續進行，幾輛又突遭侵襲，遂不得不於四月十一日令飭尙在南京之各中央機關迅卽全部遷至廣州，並責成軍事主管妥慎規劃，集中力量，縮短防綫，續為保障民主自由與國家獨立作自衛之抵抗。在此期間，廣州卽為中華民國政府所在地，除前已由外交部照會各國駐京使節外，特此通令昭告全國。我全國人民須知政府此次為維護法統憲與民主自由及國家獨立而戰，釁自彼開，曲不在我，務宜熟權利害，明辨是非，一致興起，協助政府完成此安邦定亂之重任，我全國忠勇將士並應益加淬厲，黽勉圖功。所有中央地方各軍政人員以及各級民意機關，各民眾團體，尤盼能同德一心，堅守立場，推誠合作，期早出人民於水火，挽國運于危亡，大任當前，義無反顧，尙其懔遵此旨，救國自救此令」。</p>
<h3>李代總統飛蒞廣州　書面談話盼中共臨崖勒馬　如仍迷信武力決堅強抵抗</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州八日電〕李代總統八日午由閻錫山·陳濟棠·朱家驊三氏聯同乘追雲號專機自桂飛抵廣州，立委李天·周天賢·總統府第二局長黃雪邨·機要室主任李揚·第六局副局長關仲方等同來。代總統專機於下午一時降落天河機場，中樞首要及立監委到機場歡迎者有于右任·何應欽·孫科·童冠堅·吳鐵城·王寵惠·陳立夫·李文範·李宗黃·蔣夢麟·劉哲·杭立武·徐永昌·劉攻芸·葉公超·馬超俊·陳慶雲·鄭彥棻·顧祝同·黃少谷·張發奎·余漢謀·薛岳·張鎮·唐縱·陳克文·倪炯聲·延國符·邱昌渭·王啓江·尹述賢·楊幼炯·及總統府第三局長劉士毅·第六局長徐本生·交際科長朱華封等二百餘人，情況甚為熱烈。李代總統下機後，與歡迎者一一握手，並檢閱儀隊，旋驅車赴迎賓館休息。廣州綏靖公署卽於今午設宴為李代總統洗塵，並邀中樞各首要作陪。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州八日電〕李代總統八日午抵穗後，發表書面談話稱：</p>
<p>本人此次離京赴桂小住，因連月勞頓，須稍事休養，在桂期間，承中央曁立監兩院諸同人深致關切，並一再電促，至用心感。政府為顧慮國家艱難，人民疾苦，已不勝再受戰爭之摧殘，故決心誠意謀和，蔣總統並為促進和平，毅然引退，渠個人過去對國家之貢獻，如完成北伐，對日抗戰及廢除不平等條約，固已留下不可磨滅之殊勳功績，而此次為民請命，敝屣尊榮，此種大仁大勇之精神，尤宜為舉世所敬佩，本人主政後，亦認定兄弟圍牆之爭，應均可用政治方式求取解決，故決定根據政府一貫主張，與中共誠意進行和談。不料中共所提出之條件過於苛刻，使政府無法接受，同時并於政府覆電請再作考慮之際，卽悍然不顧，強行渡江，進迫京畿，於政府自首都撤退後，猶復向蘇浙皖贛各地進攻，政府不得已迫為自衛而應戰，致江南人民因此重罹戰禍之慘，殊堪痛心。本人身受國家人民付託之重，未能早消兵革，克致祥和，自愧誠信不足以感人，深滋　咎。際此國家人民創深痛鉅之時，戰火雖已復燃，但本人基於一貫之信念，固仍深盼中共能臨崖勒馬，以國家人民為重，改變其以武力征服全中國之企圖，以副全國人民渴求和平之願望。惟中共如仍迷信武力，無心悔禍，必欲始終以兵戎相見，則釁自彼開，曲不在我，政府為維護國家獨立與民主自由，亦只有對此暴力壓迫作堅強之抵抗，戰爭責任自有攸歸，應為我全國同胞所共喻。至於政府方面，本人認定今後吾人必須本大澈大悟之精神，泯除一切派系私見，力謀精誠團結，使民主進步之新生力量，得以迅速長成，並以堅定之意志，澈底貫澈革新政治之主張，務必一洗以往積弊，始能振敝起衰，撥亂返治。總之，此後舉凡一切為人民解除痛苦，與為保障民主自由與國家獨立之工作，本人決將領導政府排除障碍，盡其最大之努力，務望我全國各級軍政人員仰體時艱，及政府意旨，毋餒毋懈，克盡職責，全國同胞盡力協助，以共同完成此艱鉅之時代任務。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州八日電〕政院發言人稱：李代總統在桂林作短期作休養後，已於八日下午一時飛抵穗，稍事休息後，卽與何院長及黨政軍負責人商討與軍政有關各重要問題，六時半後，至何院長官邸商談一切。按日來外間對李代總統遲遲來穗之原因，曾有不少謠傳，實則均為望風捕影之談，毫無事實根據，蔣總統以其國民黨總裁之地位，領導全黨與李代總統合作無間，外傳蔣總統卽將來穗之說，亦非事實，李代總統返穗後，一切謠言均將自息云。</p>

<p>自四月二十四日晚間與××兄通州後，翌晨破曉時分：告別故鄉，轉往西墊，由象山港乘艦隨節離省。當摒擋行李之際反啓程以後，對於故鄉可愛的人情風物，生無限依戀之感，我們走後，一定會使地方上父老兄弟姊妹們感到恐慌與失望。三個月來，蔣先生對於地方治安，經濟，以及文化教育等的關心，與我們地方人士對於蔣先生的敬仰與愛戴，在彼此之間已建立起了更深厚的情誼，他的心情一定是非常的沉重與難受，今後地方的治安，天一閣的藏書，與奉化縣的修志等問題，都使他異常掛慮與不安，但是　蔣先生是國家的領袖，現在雖然是在野之身，而國家與政府仍須要他出來號召人民與支持全國一致共同奮鬥完成革命，終不能偏處一隅，讓全國人民失卻了他的鼓勵與指導，他自己也因為受愛國心與正義感的驅使，以及黨政軍各方面的敦促，不能再在鄉間度其悠閒的生活，他在四月二十七日的告同胞書中說：「中正對於過去政治經濟的缺陷和剿匪軍事的失敗，以致我們同胞遭受共匪的蹂躪和殘殺……這是我個人德薄能鮮應該負其重大的責任，因為我對共產黨的陰謀暴行認識特為深切，所以我對國家所處的危難與人民所受的災禍，愧疚尤其沉痛，但是我決不動搖我救國救民的信念，確信我們必能從共產鐵幕之中拯救我全國同胞重登自由康樂的境域……同胞們！國家的危亡與個人的災禍，是十分迫切……十一年前南京撤守，政府西廷……今日南京撤守，政府南移，便成為我們反共鬥爭惟一的轉機……最後成功歸於最後努力者」。這充分可以說明他此次離鄉的願望與目的，我想大家讀到以後，必能了解蔣先生此時的情緒與心境，也能諒解他此次赴難之迅速與大家不告而別的原因了。</p>
<p>自南京撤守以後，敵人沿京滬鐵路及京杭國道二路猛進夾攻滬杭，前綫失利的消息，連續而來，上海居民一日數驚，風聲鶴唳，商店交易稀少，人心恐慌萬狀，滬甬航綫擁擠尤甚，同鄉遺眷返鄉者極多，各種對外交通均莫不如此，物價在銀元猛漲之下，相對的急速下跌，各地難民　集市區，在如此緊張的情形之下我們隨，蔣先生抵滬，這正是四月廿六日的中午。兵艦椗泊在近郊江心，當即有地方軍政方面人士登艦向蔣先生問候，艦上的小客廳便成為臨時的會客室，坐着滿滿的一屋子客人，他們的情緒均是異常興奮，並懷着滿腔的熱情，向蔣先生報告一般軍政狀況，猶如見到了久別的父兄一樣，這一幕又緊張又親切的會晤，我們在旁看了幾乎熱淚奪眶而出。第二天來訪的客人更多了，於是蔣先生決定移居上海，以便與他的朋友及部屬們接談，我們也都帶着簡單的行李上岸，住在靠江的小房子裏工作，本地晚報裏也有了蔣先生到滬的消息，有幾位老同事也來看看我們，在彼此熱烈握手之後，都說「難得你們到上海來，我們感到心裏非常安慰，今天的舖子裏的生意較昨前好多了。」在這種情緒之下，一天復一天，不覺我們已住了五天。戰事穩住在昆山以西，上海逐日的慢慢恢復了原有的繁榮，在各方面挽留之下，蔣先生本人又捨不得離開上海的民眾，我們真不曉得還要住多久。</p>
<p>依上海外圍的工事來說，是經過相當長時間的構築，兵力也相當雄厚，內部的存糧足敷三個月之需，同時聽市政府方面朋友說，取得美國物資援助的希望也甚大，但是依常情推測，唯一可慮的還是在上述諸問題，因為上海的人口實在太大，而極大多數是經營商業，如敵人迫近，燃料與糧食缺乏，工廠關門，商業停頓，則市民就無以為生，所以防守都市作保衛戰，內部經濟問題實與軍事問題有同樣的重要性，要克服這個困難，就非政府與民眾合作不可。希望上海必能克服當前難關，完成其為反共基地之使命。</p>
<p>最近省政府撤退過甬，寗波想已十分緊張，遙望甬江，不勝懷念，揆度目前敵情，甬地並非軍事合作，諒可確保地方安寗，先生等為地方民從喉舌，尤應竭力促成軍民合作，為黨國，為地方，俱有此要，凡此當在明察，無須弟之多言也。</p>
<p>弟生於斯，長於斯，受教育於斯，鄉土之感，因以特別深切，情之所鍾，莫可自己，故乘此深夜業餘之暇，作書與先生等一敘別情，藉向諸父老兄弟姊妹們致意，並願以後陸續為我鄉人亦愛蔣先生也，未知先生等以為然否？</p>
<p>旅次工作忙碌，作書草率不恭，並祈亮　為幸。餘容後敘，敬禍撰安。</p>
<p>五月一日午夜於上海旅次</p>
<h3>社論　打開德國僵局的轉機</h3>
<p>當東西兩方間的「冷戰」因為大西洋公約的簽訂益趨劇烈之時，國際間突然傳出世界和平的福音，爭議不已達十個月之久的柏林封鎖問題，德國東西間的封鎖即可解除，一切交通均將恢復常態了。這不僅是德國人民之福，從此可以避免祖國被割裂的慘痛；而且也是國際間一件最可喜的事情，德國的僵局打開之後，其他的國際問題均可迎刃而解，展望本月三十日在巴黎召開的四國外長會議，必能化國際間的戾氣為祥和，對於世界和平的締造，當有更進一步的貢獻。</p>
<p>但是我們對於月底召開的外長會議，也不能抱着過分的奢望；只要這次四國外長會議能將德國問題予以澈底的合理的公平的解決，對於歐洲的和平的前途，就算有無比的裨益，所以，我們迫切地盼望德國問題能首先獲得澈底的解決。西德「雛型政府」的成立，雖可自為德國復歸統一的先聲，但德國問題的澈底解決，尙有待四國外長的共同努力。據合眾社華盛頓六日電稱，蘇聯對於德國問題，可能提出下列三項條件：（一）在德國中央政府之下，統一全德國；（二）四強加速撤退駐在德國境內之佔領軍；（三）加緊完成對德和約。這三項條件，在蘇聯解除對柏林封鎖之後，尙可為英美接受作為四國外長會議討論的基礎，使這僵持達十月之久的柏林問題獲得轉機，不論站在何種立場，對於這個轉機終是要表示歡迎的。誠如路透社的外交記者報道稱：歐洲各國首都聞悉柏林封鎖即可解除之消息後，莫不表示欣慰：其愉快的心情，以視一九四五年獲悉第二次大戰告終的喜訊，尤有過之。</p>
<p>其實，柏林的封鎖問題，早就該解決了。以蘇聯而言，封鎖柏林原係一種報復措施，現已喪失了它原來的目的；長此下去，徒然增加德國人民的痛苦而已，何不早日解除？此在英美方面，更是如此，柏林的封鎖要增加英美空運接濟的費用，無異加重英美人民的負担，只要蘇聯肯先行解除封鎖，其他的問題都可以從長協商。今年一月三十日史達林曾向美國記者史密斯，提出一個世界和平的計劃，其要點有四：（一）蘇聯愿與美國聯合發表聲明，保證兩國均無意訴諸戰爭；（二）蘇聯準備與美國合作，共同採取為了履行此種和平公司而擬定的措施，例如逐漸裁軍之類；（三）如英·美·法三國同意在外長會議開會審議整個德國問題之前，將建立西德政府一事延緩進行，則蘇聯準備解除柏林封鎖，但英·美·法三國也應該同時解除運輸和貿易方面的限制。（四）史達林同意與杜魯門會晤，檢討美蘇關係。蘇聯人有解除柏林封鎖之意，是顯而易見的。只要美國也有此意，早就可以解除的。</p>
<p>可是美國始終懷疑蘇聯的誠意，杜魯門總既拒絕與史達林會晤，國務院又要求蘇聯須以事實表現出來證明其誠意；因此，美國的態度，也非常明顯，質言之，美國對於德國問題的解決，有三項主張：（一）美國不願摒棄他國，與蘇聯直接進行談判；（二）解決國際紛爭應循正常的外交交途徑提出；（三）蘇聯如欲解決柏林問題，須先解除柏林的封鎖。這樣，雙方又發生「先後的問題」，相持不下；使柏林問題和平解決的希望，又復歸於幻滅了。直到了上月成功湖傳出消息，謂蘇聯出席聯合國代表馬立克向美國代表建議：「西方國家如能訂一為蘇聯所能接受的日期，舉行四國外長會議，則蘇聯在外長會議之前，即解除柏林的封鎖。」這正是西方國家求之不得的理想，因此雙方稍經接觸，立則商獲成議，使柏林問題獲了轉機。</p>
<p>德國問題的轉機，也就是世界和平的轉機，是值得世界各國珍視的。尤其是西方國家的政治外交家，更要把握住這個稍縱即逝的轉機。不僅要藉此時機打開德國問題的僵局，而且也要以此為締造世界和平的轉捩點。即以蘇聯所提三項條件而言，不論是統一德國，撤退佔領軍或是商訂對德和約，也無一不是西方國家求之不得的事情。西方國家的政治外交家負有世界安危的重責，尤應放大眼光，運用智慧，抓住時機，撥開國際間的愁雲慘霧，透射出和平的陽光，讓全世界億兆人民都能感受到和平的溫暖。</p>

<h3>西方三國將舉行預備會　檢討對德共同政策　巴黎西郊古宮擇定為四外長開會地點　美國反對撤退駐德佔領軍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕美英法三國今日悄然透露，巴黎四外長會議開幕前，三國將先行會議，檢討對西和德之共同政策，但並非合夥對付蘇聯。國務院艾契遜宣布將於下星期杪派遣駐歐監察使傑塞普與國務院顧問波倫赴巴黎，與美法代表會晤。艾氏本人則將遲一星期動身赴巴黎，與蘇外長維辛斯基，英外相貝文及法外長許曼正式會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎七日電〕法外交部發言人稱，四強外長於五月廿三日在巴黎開會討論德國問題時，將以巴黎西部豪華的玫瑰大理石宮為開會地點。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓七日電〕某美國高級外交人員七日透露，美國將直率拒絕任何有關迅卽撤退駐德佔領軍的蘇聯建議。渠稱，國務院正在草擬反建議，俾當蘇聯在四強外長會議中提出此項要求時立即提出。渠稱，美國仍採取長期佔領政策。由於此一人士為國務卿阿契遜的機密顧問，最近並參與草擬美國在四強會議中所持的軍略的工作，而且必將為美代表團團員之一，此項觀點，可視作具有權威性者。雖然據鐵幕後之跡象，蘇聯的軍略將在贏得德國家主義份子的支持，蘇聯顯將破壞建立西德國的西方計劃，而此項軍略則有賴於迅即撤退一切盟國佔領軍的建議。此一官員稱，美國深信蘇聯的此種計劃均將失敗。第一，此舉遭西區國家的反對，特別是法國，因為他們担心德國侵略的再起，第二，許多德國人不希望美軍撤退。最後渠警告稱，「吾人實不能希望在巴黎會議中完全解決德國問題。」</p>
<h3>東德領向西德建議　商統一德國步驟　撤除封鎖殆已完成準備</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林七日電〕當蘇聯及西方交通人員於昨夜正在商洽解除封鎖之時間表之際，自稱代表整個德國之「德人民委員會」突然建議，與西德代表在英區勃朗維克開會，以起草關於德國政治經濟文化統一的計劃，以便向五月廿三日巴黎之四強外長會議提出。</p>
<p>該項建議並要求迅速締結和約及撤退佔領軍。該項建議書由東德基督民主黨，自由民主黨及社會統一黨代表諾許克，卡斯特納及格洛特伍爾簽署，其中並指出若在外長會議召開以前，企圖以西德政府之成立造成旣成事實，足以加深東西德間之分裂。按西方強國已一再聲明，四強在紐約所成立之協定，不應干涉預定於今夏設立西德共和國之計劃，惟西德憲法制定的方式，可以於四強獲得協議後，使其得以適用於全德國。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林七日電〕權威方面謂，西方各國與蘇聯當局已在柏林作第一次接觸，討論解除封鎖之各細則，但討論之內容，則守極端秘密。同時弗蘭克福雙佔區軍事運輸機構之英美代表亦已抵此，會商解除封鎖之細則</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林七日電〕英發言人聲稱，英美運輸官員已告知德鐵路當局，準備於五月十一日午夜恢復至柏林火車之行駛。彼等並囑鐵路當局儘可能調集車皮，以便將煤斤糧食原料消費品輸往柏林。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林七日電〕柏林蘇區政府今夜宣布願於柏林封鎖解除後，立即恢復對西柏林之電流供應。</p>
<h3>克萊定十五日　離柏林返美</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林七日電〕卽將卸職之美駐德軍事總督克萊，定於柏林封鎖解除後之第三日，即五月十五日乘飛機離柏林。渠於今日向記者談稱，渠在卸任前得見柏林封鎖解除，極為愉快。相信巴黎四強外長會議有獲致協議的極大可能性。克萊又曰，渠預料難望有機會，於行前向蘇聯軍政府要員道別，如能與其相遇，祇擬道一聲再會，不擬舉行任何會談。渠又透露，蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基調任後易為邱柯克元帥後，渠從未與其晤面。談及其個人的今後計劃時，渠曰，渠於六月一日退役後，將往垂釣，其他別無計劃。渠定五月十五日卸職之日乘飛機離柏林，在華盛頓逗留兩週以待等滿退役之日，然後將其妻赴野外溪水之旁渡夏。渠在美國並無房屋，故行址並無一定，渠並聲明目前尙無意撰作任何備忘錄。</p>
<h3>西德臨時政府　正副總統人選</h3>
<p>〔合眾社波恩七日電〕此間消息靈通之政界稱，基督民主黨之阿丹諾，將為西德臨時政府之總統，史柯密特將為副總統。社會黨之曼柴爾將任內長，凱撒任為勞工部長，及自由黨阿斯科夫將任財長。按波恩制憲會議已於六日晚選出十八名非共黨之「執委會」，暫時執行西德政務，直至普選之政府產生後。一般預料該執委會將提出締結德國和約之建議，俾可能在巴黎召開之和會中討論之。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕政府高級人士稱，政府將要求會批准於下年度撥款至少二億元，以增強希臘土耳其之戰鬥力。該項要求將於政府正式提出軍事援助外國十四億五十萬元之計劃時同時提出。</p>
<h3>賽珍珠反戰</h3>
<p>指美人民入危險路徑　主反對接受黷武者命令</p>
<p>〔聯合社康尼蒂克州赫德福八日電〕著名女作家賽珍珠今日稱，亞洲人民乃世界和平最理想之對象。惟有中國，暹羅，印尼，緬甸與印度人民始有世界犬同之哲學意識。西方世界仍在幼稚時期，不能作大同思想。美國軍事領袖正導吾人於虛僞與危險之路徑，吾人必須反對接受黷武者之命令，政府倘若堅決提倡黷武主義則吾人當公開反對。當母親公開主張其兒子從軍之時，吾國之家庭制度必有缺點。</p>

<h3>美國民主黨縱橫談（下）</h3>
<p>— 宋桂煌譯</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>威爾遜使得昔日傑克遜型的民主黨，完全復活了。這位以前的普林斯頓大學校長，始終保持着嚴峻的態度，果然證明是一個具有魄力的政治領袖，能夠大胆地講話，以大無畏的精神來行動，教育這全代的民主黨員，使他們相信政府應排除一切困難以保護平民。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰結束後，威爾遜的內政改革劃便跟着停止了，而戰後的反動局勢，又造成了哈定。與柯立芝統治之下的共和黨風氣時代。一九二九年的崩潰，證明了三十年代中的繁榮是不能持久的。當一九三〇年至一九三一年期內，不景氣降臨於美國人民，守候麺包的長蛇陣加長，無家可歸的人民於都市垃圾場中建築茅棚的時候，兩黨制度便遭遇了它自內戰時期以來最可怕的試鍊。一九三二年，局勢便顯出，全國將就民主黨中產生大總統。但是，如果民主黨雖欲解決經濟問題，而能力亦不出乎共和黨之上，那末，九死一生的人民自欲使兩黨制度以外找求解決方法了。</p>
<p>但是民主黨中果然出了能夠解決經濟危機的領袖人物。佛蘭克林，羅斯福，能將哲斐孫的政治機敏性，與傑克遜的奮鬥精神，以及威爾遜的鼓舞人民奮進的能力，集合於一身。所謂「新政」，自不無其不合邏輯及自相矛盾之處。自傑克遜以來，沒有那一位總統曾如佛蘭克林，羅斯福之受人民的痛恨，而這種痛恨的殘餘，至今仍有存留。但是「新政」確實醫治了四十年代中使美國人民陷於麻痺的神經失常。有許多年中，羅斯福的缺點在他的成功的全景中不見了，蓋其時已經恢復了美國人民的奮鬥們心和民主的生活方式了。</p>
<p>羅斯福以黨魁的資格，加強了哲斐孫與傑克遜所創立而經布賴安與威爾遜所恢復的種種政策，以為民主黨的主要方針。北方的自由主義者，都市中的工商界鉅子，以及勞工運動，起初本來皆為北方農民所擁護者，此時卻復以南方為基地，構成了「新政」力量的前鋒。但是「新政」的橫衝直撞，對於民主黨亦有傷害的作用。在內戰期中，南方人士（包括工商界在內）曾一體服膺民主黨，但是在羅斯福當政期內，南方的保守派卻日益表示不快。僅賴乎他個人的天才，才能使得他們不致異動，但是這種成功亦日益減色。杜魯門總統在這方面，便毫無成就。</p>
<p>總之，自傳統而言，民主黨本是南北相異分子的結合，不時發生內鬨，只有產生了強有力領袖的時候，才能使得它成為一個有效的工具。這個政黨，又以具有強有力的領袖為其特點。自林肯以至羅斯福的傳統，是否能在共和黨中再獲勝利，那只有等到將來才能看出。</p>
<p>一般人都認美國的兩黨均不代表什麼主義或政策，而由兩黨的歷史看來，則知其實不然。兩黨對於資產階級統治，及對於總統領導方式的態度，大不相同。不過實際上，兩黨並非代表完全不相同而互相不能協調的利害，而這顯然便是美國兩黨制度的力量的泉源所在。有些人士希望兩黨的分子，能夠依然自由與保守兩種方向嚴格地分化，以為如此才能合乎羅輯。回溯當一八六〇年大選之際，兩黨曾經嚴格地分別代表不同的利益，但是共和黨競選失敗後，黨員見到該黨已無握權希望，結果祇有脫黨一途，別無他法。美國的兩黨制度一向維持了一種微妙的關係，蓋兩黨的政策可有改變，分子亦可有進退，但決不互相大為敵對，造成勢不可解的形勢。兩黨之內以及兩黨之間，時時需要妥協，這是美國政黨制度中的優點，蓋終究言之，所謂民主政府，便是利用妥協與同意的政體。</p>
<p>不消說，政黨為政治自由所必不可少之物。單一投票制度，如納粹及共產主義的集權政治所表現者，不過是專政的一個好聽的名辭而已。就以往而言，美國的具有伸縮性的兩黨制度，總能應合美國民主政治的需求，而我們盼望這種制度，能夠繼續配合美國人民的需求，當不為不合理吧。（全文完）</p>
<h3>緬甸加倫族叛亂的來龍去脈</h3>
<p>— 許斯仁</p>
<p>〔本報仰光航訊〕是去年十一月十九日的一個下午，緬甸政府宣傳部長烏吞帕氏，假緬甸報界協會舉行記者招待會。開會時，主人烏吞帕帶着緊張的臉孔向到會的記者們說：「…諸位，今天這個招待會的目的，是想向諸位報告一件極其令人惋惜的事情的發生。這件事情的製造者，不但不該，而且也太不聰明，所以緬甸政府才不顧一切地把這事情公佈出來」。烏氏述完了這簡短的談話後，繼着送給各記者以印刷品的畫面說話一份。該書面談話這麼地寫着：「…在這裏要告訴大家的，是倫敦每日郵報的駐緬甸記者康貝爾氏，於前天被緬甸政府根據國防條例加以逮捕，緬甸政府所以逮捕康貝爾氏的原因，是因為康氏曾煽動緬甸少數民族叛亂，而引起了緬甸民族間的衝突。康氏這種行為，緬甸政府經獲得有實在的證據。事緣本年八月間，康氏曾託英國海外航空公司的飛行員西門氏代他帶一封用火漆封固的信給在印度加爾各答的英國軍人達勒上校，那封信的內容曾有下列的辭句：「…先生托交的信，因為收信人不在，故於昨日寄交SS君。M君在第一號等候先生送來軍火彈藥。關於伯里斯朋友開來的兩艘輪船的消息，經已轉知Q君。依SS君稱，情形不好，如果再得不到外援，恐難再支持十五天，本人曾到他的總部，據悉少數民族本能給予充分的協助，山上的朋友們，不但不向南發展，反在自鬧關牆，現在已不能再作希望他們協助的打算，進佔仰光的事，或許已沒有可能了。	K等現在只在鞏固他們佔有的城鎮，他們或許以所佔的地區為基地，而與政府談判。他們是感着武器的缺乏，兼着政府曾在他們叛亂以前，繳奪他們以前所有的許多武器，因此削弱了他們的力量。…」這封信的秘密之所以洩漏，是因為康貝爾氏託他帶信的西門氏，是一個英國進步社會黨的黨員，堅決反對英國干涉緬甸內政，以收信人的達勒上校，是被認為留在加城指揮緬甸倫族叛亂的人物，故西門氏把康貝爾氏的信偷拆起來看。當他發現康貝爾氏的秘密時，卽把康氏的原函內容抄下來，報告給緬甸駐巴基斯坦大使烏帕肯氏，烏帕肯得報後，卽趕速通知緬甸政府採取行動扣留康貝爾。當康貝爾氏被捕時，又曾在其身上搜出致達勒上校的另一文件，內稱：「……近日曾和奧里伐氏會晤於加倫總會，曾將你向他索款的信提交他，他已答應將款寄給你，自那天起，已有七·八天沒有見到他了。至昨晨他才帶來了要在報上發表的消息，他們現已佔領毛始加當至伯達等地區，（記者按：毛始加當為緬化南暹的一個墟區）</p>
<p>他們並在修理日本建築的飛機場。又他們近已將直塘·毛洛棉·巴森等地方的周圍佔領，且已在毛洛棉組織有行政機構。昨日有一架政府飛機被他們扣住，他們可望於日內佔丹老及勃朗姆。奧里伐說：他們需要軍火很急，正希望你由海路或空路送到毛洛棉，你的朋友們也正望寄錢前來。坦白的說，目前的情況不大滿人意，我們的朋友並不曾澈底行動，本人在仰光行動受監視，新聞送往加爾各答殊為不易，紅加倫並不幫助平地的加倫，原因是在關宗教的衝突。投入緬甸政府懷抱，而獲任為緬甸陸軍總司令的史密頓，也不如我們所預期那樣如我們合作，他簡直是被緬甸政府所收買了。總之，福伯特方面如不能供給所城的一切工具，恐怕我們的計劃將遭到失敗的命運……」康貝爾氏被捕後，一般人都集中眼光在看這事情的發展，大家早就料到事情的發展以後，不外是英國政府提出鄭重聲明，說康貝爾是私人行動，絕對與英國政府無關。</p>
<p>果不出所料，在康氏被捕的第二天，英國駐緬大使館的聲明來了，無須說，他所說的是大家早就料到的話，說康氏這次的事件全是康氏與達勒上校的私人行動，英國下令全不知情，緬甸政府儘可處康氏以應得之罪。還說康氏是英駐緬使館自己捕交緬甸政府的。有人說，這是英國的「犧牲小我，顧全大我」。要不然，事情已經弄出破綻來，英國人援助加倫人反抗緬甸政府的正正確確的物證，已落在緬甸政府手裏，英國要不是犧牲一個「小我」的康貝爾，而來這麼一個一百八十度的大轉灣，那英國將何以對世界人士？</p>
<p>實行叛亂</p>
<p>無論英國人鼓動加倫族反抗緬甸政府是否有其事，而緬甸加倫族實行武力爭取分治卻是真的了。早在去年緬甸獨立後沒有幾天，緬甸政府卽突然地接到一封加倫族的呈文，要示劃永盛縣，汗打弗利縣，與三角洲的勃生縣，和緬南的丹那少令區等地為吉仁邦這突如其來的要求，確使緬甸政府摸不到頭腦。因為在緬甸爭取獨立過程中，加倫族雖未曾盡過力，但卻也沒有公開反對。緬甸獲得獨立時，組織政府，加倫族也派人參加，確實想不到加倫會來這麼一着突如其來的變卦。事後政府雖然以綏靖的政策把這問題暫時偃息下來，但加倫族的要求分治卻一直在醞釀中。去年八月間，三角洲一帶的加倫，趁着政府忙於應付緬共和白臂章志願軍的叛亂的當兒，遂來一下趁火打刦，運用武力，先後把三角洲幾處加倫區域的政府行政官員趕走，由加倫人民自己組織行政機構，實行區域自治，同時以武力拱衛這些地方，不容政府軍侵入。那時候政府為因忙於應付緬共和白志願軍，不得不屈而就之。後來政府雖然成立了一個調查委員會，出發調查加倫族所要求劃分區域的民意，並宣佈政府對待加倫族的政策，謂只要加倫族的要求是合理的，在可能範圍內，政府當儘可能允許加倫人的要求。但是政府這張類似空頭支票的諾言，並未能得到加倫族的滿意，因而加倫族的騷亂也就繼續在蔓延中；不過初時只是屬於地方性的騷擾，且不敢公然豎起加倫族的旗號吧了。迨至康貝爾的事件發生後，才慢慢由半掩面而趨於公開。先是於今年正月十日，緬南毛洛棉附近的加倫開始實行正式以武力要求建邦分治，這緬甸政府自然是不肯的，於是加緬兩族的民族戰爭，也卽爆發了。毛洛棉於事情發生時，卽被佔領，繼着三角洲的重鎮巴林也告陷落，保羅姆（緬西的重鎮）的加倫軍千餘人也實行叛變，緬京——曼德里一帶的加倫，也聯合緬共把距緬京四十三英里的緬甸避暑勝地　苗，和緬京以下的東瓜，敏撒拉，任尾申……等地佔據。就連仰光市郊的達買（距仰光五英里）印盛（距仰光十三英里）禮居（距仰光二十五英里）的加倫族也實行叛亂起來，三角洲的港口端低早就被加倫車站所佔領，致使三角洲的海運全部無法通航。仰光市郊的加倫騷動者，原係想進佔仰光，幸政府發覺得早，得以把他截住在達買。仰光近郊的戰事發生到記者寫這篇稿時已經快一個月了，但政府軍仍迄未能把印盛克復。緬京方面的亂事，又在日益加劇，兼着泰金諾總理，堅持這次的戰爭是好人與壞人的戰爭，不是加緬兩民族的戰爭，絕對不願以和平的辦法來解決。根據這情形看起來，戰事也許還是要繼續打下去的。（未完）</p>

<h3>地攤風起雲湧　待售物品應有盡有　實足營業十五小時</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近數日來，本市各馬路旁擺設「地攤」求售物品者實告空前增加。此種「地攤」市場在本市原祇限於虬江路，武定路，老西門，及南京路中央商場等數處，但目前則如雨後春筍，到處可見。其中尤以西藏路北起泥城橋，南迄南陽橋，金際東路由八仙橋至東新橋一段，彼此相接，人行道上幾無絲毫空隙，馴至使行人舉步維艱，其盛況洵較勝利後本市亦曾風靡一時之「玻璃櫃攤販」更為鬧熱。此種地攤上陳列之待售物品，形形色色，應有盡有，包括各種日用品，呢絨綢縀衣料，皮鞋，藥品，書籍，化裝品，機械零件，服裝等等，幾如一露天百貨店。</p>
<p>擺攤人物共有四種</p>
<p>據記者略調查結果，此輩擺設地攤之從業人員中，因服務機關解散無法生活而出售家藏者占百分十，係各廠行現役職工於發薪時領得部份實物後設攤求售者占百分之卅，原以此種地攤為固定職業，或僅係由他處遷來中區者占百分之廿，本係流動員買賣銀洋之「黃牛」因受功令限制而改業地攤者占百分之四十。</p>
<p>汗衫襪為實銷最暢</p>
<p>由於上四種人物求售物品之來源各異，故定價貴賤相差極大。其中平均以夏令用品最昂，汗衫襪褲之類實銷最暢，顧客則以家庭主婦及軍公人員較多。至於渠等設攤之地點，每日無法固定，因人多地狹，必須在清晨戒嚴時間終止後紛出佔守地盤，後至者卽無法插足。渠等設攤之時間大都自上午六時起至晚九時止，實足營業十五小時，為目前上海所有商業中營業時間最長者。</p>

<h3>臨烽火邊緣陸家浜近況　難民紛至沓來　學校絃歌不輟</h3>
<p>京滬車近以陸家浜為終點，鄉僻小鎮，居然為烽火邊緣的往來要衝，該鎮市稍為蘇滬公路（安亭等處橋樑損壞，不能通車，望該地人士，迅籌行人方便之道），距陸家浜車站六華里，每日由公路步行或下火車過境之難民，日以萬計，扶老携幼，肩捎背負者，紛至沓來，亦有西服革履，旗袍燙髪者，蹣跚而過，自陸經茜墩角直抵蘇州，約二日可達，該處民眾自衛會及慈善家，紛紛施茶施弱，增加渡船，各寺廟及公共場所，充作難民宿夜者，幾無隙地，日夜招料，本諸人類互助同情，然亦有少數點心店，偷工減料，高抬物價，傳所謂利令智昏耳。</p>
<p>上海疏散人口，紛紛西行，然亦有從南京常錫等處長途跋涉，經該鎮搭車赴滬者，日有數起，數亦不少，其中不乏並無身分證者，致岐途徬徨，徒喚奈何。</p>
<p>火車每班到達，輒有工人模樣者數百人，到鎮採辦食物，或以捲煙等實物交換，致白米價格一日數跳，羊猪肉整隻殺白大量運出，該處鄉公所自衛會因搶購者日眾，已定限制辦法。</p>
<p>鴻鈞中學及菉葭國民小學照常上課，絃歌不輟，但小學教師公糧，早已毫無着落。</p>
<p>離此十二里茜墩方面，曾有冒充軍人刦掠難民之不人道行為，致一部分難民，悽然折返，欲哭無淚，事經保安隊徐大隊長聞悉，大為震怒，派隊馳往查拿，故近日一路平安，欺侮難民之事，稍稍歛跡矣。</p>

<h3>中航險勝羣力　四比三差一球</h3>
<p>甲組足球聯賽已成尾聲，昨日午後四時，中航羣力相逢於逸園，觀眾稀，祇一二百左右，雙方意興蘭珊，中少航實力星散，羣力主持人潘時傑亦已去港，一場惡鬥，結果四比三中航以一球之差，壓倒羣力。</p>
<p>鳴笛開賽，中航五鋒挺進，高秀清迫切力射，首先破關，未幾，羣力反攻，林紹鈞主開角球，落點奇佳，陳龍泉低射中的，扳成平手。鏖戰至廿七分鐘，商華均刦得來球，輸送前方，高秀清單騎刦營，冼伯銘衝陣，小高挑向空門，趙永芳大脚勾出，化險為夷。一瞬後陳龍泉自拉自唱，搗入一球，二對一後來居上，上半時旋告結束。</p>
<p>休息片刻，兩軍接戰，中航原陣不動，羣力余木森登陣，易出陸芳奎，中航奮力應戰，徐祖國傳中，冼伯銘撲出，李順生近門撥入，再成和局。此後鄭思民吊向門前，徐祖國一飛沖天，中航再接再厲，李順生妙傳中路，高秀清單力直入，三對二再度前領。中航士氣振奮，更形得手，鄭思民啣枚疾走，底綫勾中，徐祖國切射中鵠，成四比二壓倒優勢。羣力怒氣沖天，誓復失地，林紹鈞於亂車中斬落一關。此後兩軍雖然努力，但均未有建樹，時間告終，中航以四比三一球之差取勝。</p>

<h3>今日甲組乒乓聯賽　郵乙郵務雙戰華美</h3>
<p>前賽全綠三對二擊敗郵乙</p>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，今日起已晉入第五週秩序，今日（九日）下午五時半起續有甲組兩場，乙組四場，甲組由華美出馬連戰郵乙郵務兄弟兵，華美三戰三勝陣容堅強，本屆仍具奪標姿態，除上屆冠軍精武隊外，餘隊確非對手，此役連敵兩強，首仗自可穩取郵乙，惟次仗對壘郵務，須以精銳上陣，綠華美隊員泰半係第二屆聯賽，錦標隊滬星之選手，當年因騎輕敵，僅到六人出席，結果於先勝三組後，竟連失三組，反以三對四受挫於郵務，者悉如仍大意應戰，恐將再受教訓，郵務雖兩度失利，半因人馬不齊，半因球運惡劣，此番旣逢勁軍，必出全力一併，舊事重現，未可知也。茲探錄今日秩序如下：</p>

<p>新星—綢紅（乙三）七時正綢業　　前日甲組全綠出戰郵乙於郵務球室，雙方競爭至烈，郵乙不幸次組朱慶基於極度緊張之過程下，兩次觸板犯規，判罰兩分，心理突起變化，大失常態，遂使對方盧永康乘機猛攻，反敗為勝，以二對一奏捷，造成絕對優勢，郵乙後勁殊凶，克服四五兩組，結果仍以二對三之比慘敗於全綠。</p>

<h3>Presidential Decree Encouraging the Nation to Complete the Great Task of Stabilizing the Country and Quelling the Rebellion; Unity of Purpose to Save the Nation from Peril</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] The President issued a decree on the 8th, encouraging military and government personnel at the central and local levels, as well as people's representatives at all levels, to rise up together, unite in purpose, adhere to their positions, and assist the government in completing the great task of stabilizing the country and quelling the rebellion. The full text of the decree is recorded below: "For years, the ravages of war have not ceased. Wherever the fighting reaches, resources are often squandered, cities are turned into ruins, and the people are displaced, starving and wandering the roads, with cries of resentment filling the land. We Chinese people are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Although there may be differences in party affiliation and political views, our national interests should be the same. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, when the whole country urgently needed to recover, we are still fighting each other, brothers against brothers, which is more heartbreaking than anything else! The government, mindful of the difficulties of the nation and the suffering of the people, has advocated peace for four months, seeking compromise in every possible way. It was hoped that we could be open and honest with each other, making concessions for the sake of the country. However, the Chinese Communists suddenly proposed their so-called eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the domestic peace agreement, with harsh conditions tantamount to forcing surrender, and even set a deadline for signing, not allowing for any room to maneuver. The government could not bear to see the foundation of constitutional democracy, which had just been laid, destroyed, and the people, already in dire straits, once again suffering a great calamity. Therefore, it reiterated its righteous position, hoping for a final consideration. However, the Chinese Communists, relying on their military strength, launched a forceful crossing of the Yangtze River while government representatives were still in Ping, stating that they would completely defeat the government forces. The government, finding that peace talks could not continue and that it was facing renewed attacks, had no choice but to order all central agencies still in Nanjing to move to Guangzhou immediately on April 11th. It also charged the military authorities with carefully planning, concentrating forces, shortening the defense line, and continuing to resist in self-defense to protect democracy, freedom, and national independence. During this period, Guangzhou will be the location of the government of the Republic of China. In addition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs having already notified the diplomatic missions of various countries in Beijing, this is hereby announced to the whole country. All the people of our country must know that this time the government is fighting to uphold the rule of law, the constitution, democracy, freedom, and national independence. The war was initiated by them, and the fault does not lie with us. We must carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages, clearly distinguish between right and wrong, rise up together, and assist the government in completing this great task of stabilizing the country and quelling the rebellion. All the loyal and brave soldiers of our country should redouble their efforts and strive for merit. It is especially hoped that all military and government personnel at the central and local levels, as well as people's representatives at all levels and mass organizations, can unite in purpose, adhere to their positions, cooperate sincerely, and strive to bring the people out of suffering and save the nation from peril. With a great responsibility before us, there is no turning back. May you all respectfully abide by this decree, saving the country and saving yourselves."</p>
<h3>Acting President Li Flies to Guangzhou; In a Written Statement, He Hopes the Chinese Communists Will Pull Back from the Brink; If They Still Believe in Force, He Resolves to Resist Firmly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] Acting President Li flew from Guilin to Guangzhou on the 8th at noon on a special "Chasing Clouds" plane, accompanied by Yan Xishan, Chen Jitang, and Zhu Jiahua, as well as legislators Li Tian and Zhou Tianxian, Huang Xuecun, Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Palace, Li Yang, Director of the Confidential Office, and Guan Zhongfang, Deputy Director of the Sixth Bureau. The Acting President's plane landed at Tianhe Airport at 1 PM, where central leaders and legislative and supervisory committee members, including Yu Youren, He Yingqin, Sun Ke, Tong Guanjian, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Chonghui, Chen Lifu, Li Wenfan, Li Zonghuang, Jiang Menglin, Liu Zhe, Hang Liwu, Xu Yongchang, Liu Gongyun, Yeh Kung-chao, Ma Chaojun, Chen Qingyun, Zheng Yanfen, Gu Zhutong, Huang Shao-ku, Zhang Fakui, Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Zhang Zhen, Tang Zong, Chen Kewen, Ni Jiongsheng, Yan Guofu, Qiu Changwei, Wang Qijiang, Yin Shuxian, Yang Youjiong, as well as Liu Shiyi, Director of the Third Bureau of the Presidential Palace, Xu Bensheng, Director of the Sixth Bureau, Zhu Huafeng, Chief of the Protocol Section, and more than two hundred others were there to welcome him. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic. After disembarking, Acting President Li shook hands with the welcomers one by one and inspected the honor guard, before driving to the guesthouse to rest. The Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters hosted a banquet this afternoon to welcome Acting President Li, and invited central leaders to accompany him.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] After arriving in Guangzhou on the 8th at noon, Acting President Li issued a written statement saying:</p>
<p>"I left Beijing for a short stay in Guilin because I needed a rest after months of hard work. During my time in Guilin, I was deeply touched by the concern shown by my colleagues in the central, legislative, and supervisory branches, who repeatedly urged me to return. The government, concerned about the difficulties of the nation and the suffering of the people, and unable to bear the further destruction of war, resolved to sincerely seek peace. President Chiang, in order to promote peace, resolutely stepped down. His personal contributions to the country in the past, such as completing the Northern Expedition, resisting Japan, and abolishing unequal treaties, have left indelible achievements. This time, sacrificing his honor for the sake of the people, is a testament to his great benevolence and courage, and should be admired by the world. After taking office, I also believed that the conflict between brothers could be resolved through political means. Therefore, I decided to engage in sincere peace talks with the Chinese Communists, based on the government's consistent position. Unexpectedly, the conditions proposed by the Chinese Communists were too harsh for the government to accept. At the same time, disregarding the government's reply requesting further consideration, they forcibly crossed the Yangtze River and advanced on the capital. After the government withdrew from the capital, they continued to attack Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. The government was forced to fight back in self-defense, causing the people of Jiangnan to suffer the horrors of war again, which is deeply regrettable. I, entrusted with the heavy responsibility by the nation and the people, have failed to eliminate the scourge of war and bring about peace and harmony. I am ashamed that my sincerity was not enough to move people, and I deeply regret this. At this time when the nation and the people are deeply wounded, even though the flames of war have been rekindled, based on my consistent belief, I still deeply hope that the Chinese Communists can pull back from the brink, prioritize the nation and the people, and change their attempt to conquer all of China by force, in order to fulfill the nationwide desire for peace. However, if the Chinese Communists still believe in force, are unwilling to repent, and insist on resolving everything through military means, then they initiated the war, and the fault does not lie with us. In order to protect national independence and democratic freedom, the government has no choice but to put up a strong resistance against this violent oppression. The responsibility for the war rests with them, and this should be understood by all our compatriots. As for the government, I believe that from now on, we must act with great enlightenment and understanding, eliminate all factionalism and selfishness, strive for sincere unity, so that the new forces of democratic progress can grow rapidly. With firm determination, we must thoroughly implement the advocacy of political reform, and eliminate past malpractices in order to reverse the decline and restore order. In short, from now on, I will lead the government to remove obstacles and make the greatest efforts to relieve the people of their suffering and to protect democracy, freedom, and national independence. I hope that all military and government personnel at all levels throughout the country will understand the difficulties of the times and the government's intentions, and fulfill their duties diligently and without slackening. Compatriots throughout the country should do their best to assist, so that we can jointly complete this arduous task of our time."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] The government spokesman said: After a short rest in Guilin, Acting President Li flew to Guangzhou at 1 PM on the 8th. After a short rest, he discussed important military and political issues with President He and other party, government, and military leaders. After 6:30 PM, he went to President He's residence to discuss everything. In recent days, there have been many rumors about the reason for Acting President Li's delay in coming to Guangzhou. In fact, these are all unfounded speculations and have no basis in fact. President Chiang, in his capacity as Director-General of the Kuomintang, leads the entire party in working closely with Acting President Li. The rumors that President Chiang will come to Guangzhou are also not true. All rumors will cease after Acting President Li returns to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>North China Foreign Ships Halt</h3>
<p>[United Press, Vancouver, 7th] Shipping industry sources said on the 7th that due to the chaotic situation in China in recent months, the insurance premiums for ships sailing to ports in North China have increased by 100% for both marine and war risks. Shipping companies have relied on suspending operations.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Returns to Hankou; Wuhan's Deployment is Meticulous, and Order is Peaceful</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 8th] Commander Bai Chongxi, along with his entourage Yang Shouqiong and others, flew back to Hankou from Guilin at 2:30 PM on the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 8th] After the Wuhan Garrison Command announced late on the 7th that the area had entered a state of war and implemented martial law, the general public was somewhat alarmed. However, due to the meticulous deployment and calm attitude of the authorities, social order remained very peaceful. As of 8 PM tonight, there have been no disturbances.</p>
<h3>National Army Achieves Great Victory in Qingdao Environs; Recovers Lingshan and Advances Rapidly Towards Pingdu; Communist Army Collapses, with 8,000 Deaths</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 8th] The four-day and night battle in the suburbs of Jimo has achieved a complete victory under the personal command of General Zhao Lin. The vanguard of the National Army has crossed Songhuaquan (25 li north of Jimo) and is continuing to pursue the fleeing bandits, who have collapsed and are in a state of panic. As of the time of this dispatch, more than 8,000 bandits have been killed, and one bandit division commander, one political commissar, and one regimental commander have been wounded. In the areas of Xiatuan and Songhuaquan alone, more than 2,300 bandit corpses were abandoned.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 8th] The National Army units that recovered Lingshan are advancing rapidly towards the Pingdu County border, intercepting the fleeing bandit army. [Another dispatch] The bandit army is concentrating all its forces to attack the Xiatuan position. The defending troops bravely counterattacked, inflicting a serious blow on the bandit 94th Division. The National Army's artillery also demonstrated great power, causing heavy casualties to the bandits. They repeatedly reinforced their counterattacks, especially yesterday evening, which was even more fierce. Xiatuan was repeatedly attacked nine times and lost and regained three times.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 8th] Qingdao is now a bandit suppression base in North China. The bandits' large-scale invasion this time seems to be intended to force us to withdraw automatically. The bandit army around Qingdao has a strength of about 18,000 men, with less than 10,000 local bandits, who are poorly equipped.</p>
<h3>British Far East Army and Navy Chiefs Gather in Hong Kong; Hold Emergency Defense Meeting; First Batch of Special Police Force Begins Training Today</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 8th] It is reported that Communist guerrillas and professional bandits have surrounded Kowloon. The British garrison in Hong Kong has been ordered to prepare for action at any time and anywhere. Amidst the tense situation, Lieutenant General Ritchie, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in the Far East, and Admiral Brind, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in the Far East, have arrived from Singapore to attend an emergency defense meeting. At the same time, the first batch of special police force will begin part-time training on Monday. In the event of an emergency, the police reserve and special police force can be mobilized at any time.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] British newspapers unanimously emphasized the need to strengthen Hong Kong's defenses on the 8th. Most Sunday newspapers covered the matter with large headlines and published editorials on the front page. "World News" stated, "British Far East forces have flown to Hong Kong." "The Observer" stated, "Hong Kong is awaiting a strong attack." "The Observer" stated, "Hong Kong's two major weaknesses in defense are its water supply and the sabotage of the Communist Fifth Column." "The Sunday Times" stated, "Military circles in London strongly believed last night that guerrillas would begin to infiltrate Hong Kong within days to disrupt transportation and water supplies."</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Police Launch Search; For Murderers of Patrol Officers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 8th] Hong Kong police have launched a full-scale search for the murderers who killed two British patrol officers and one Chinese patrol officer in Hong Kong waters on Friday. Police believe that the murderers have fled to Danshui in the Communist guerrilla area. Police also believe that after the motive for the incident is fully investigated, it will be important in determining whether the Chinese Communists intend to copy the methods of the Malayan Communists to exert pressure on Hong Kong. Observers believe that similar incidents will follow this one. The Hong Kong authorities have issued a notice offering a reward of HK$20,000 to anyone who provides information leading to the arrest of the real culprits.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Calls For; Change in Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] The New York Herald Tribune said in an editorial on the 7th that the United States' policy towards China has reached a dead end and urgently needs to be changed. Even Chennault's proposal to provide the Nationalist government with $350 million in aid annually is better than the current policy. U.S. policy toward China is weak, wavering, and has reached a dead end. We are witnessing the formation of a great era, and the United States has absolutely no influence on it, nor can it extricate itself. Today, the United States should firmly establish its Far East policy, just as it declared the Monroe Doctrine for the Western Hemisphere and the Truman Doctrine for European Communism.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 7th] The Howard-owned San Francisco News recently wrote in support of Chennault's proposal to immediately allocate $350 million in aid to China, and called on Congress to decide whether this plan is feasible. The newspaper stated: If communism prevails in Asia, its threat to American security will be even greater than the current dangerous situation in Europe. The United States should be as concerned about its beachhead in China as it is about its outposts in Greece, Turkey, North Africa, and against the Chinese Communists.</p>
<h3>Theft in Our Embassy in the Philippines; Thieves Rifled Through Files</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 8th] Unidentified persons broke into our embassy in the Philippines yesterday afternoon (7th), after office hours, and searched the files in the Counselor's Office. Sun Biqi, First Secretary of the embassy, told a Central News Agency reporter this morning that all the files in the Counselor's Office have now been recorded and almost all were rifled through. However, in the preliminary investigation, no important documents have been found to be stolen. Ink pens, watches, and cash in the room were not touched, so the purpose of this act is very clear. Ambassador Chen Zhiping went to Baguio last week to meet with Philippine President Quirino and has now received a report on this matter and will return here on the 10th to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Province Abolishes County Tax Bureaus</h3>
<p>Tax collection to be handled by the Tax Section of the County Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 8th] After the financial division of the province and counties in Xinjiang Province, the tax bureaus originally established in various counties throughout the province will be abolished from this month, except for those in important commercial areas that will be retained.</p>
<p>The laid-off personnel will be given severance pay or introduced to other jobs. The tax collection business in various places will be merged into the tax section established by the county government to be responsible for handling it, and it is stipulated that all tax rates will be collected in silver dollars from May 20th.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Restricts the Export of Gold and Silver</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 8th] The Yunnan Provincial Government recently promulgated temporary measures prohibiting the export of gold and silver. All public and private gold, silver, and silver coins are not allowed to be transported out of the province without approval. Passengers leaving the province are allowed to carry two taels of gold ornaments, twenty taels of silver ornaments, and twenty silver dollars. Anything exceeding the limit will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Qingdao All Sectors Enthusiastic About Boosting Morale</h3>

The people are fleeing because they cannot afford the burden.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 8th] Military News: After a brief contact with the National Army last night, the Communist army advancing westward in Dongxiang has shown no significant activity under the surveillance of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military News at 10 AM on the 8th: (1) Bandits continued to increase last night (7th) in the Zhitang, Shaxi, and Yuewangshi areas of Changshu, and sent more than 100 plainclothes personnel to Liuhe, Tangjiaxiang, and Loutang to raid and cause trouble.

<h3>Air Force Destroys Communist Army Command Post</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Air Force launched extensive attacks on the periphery of Taicang, Liuhe, Kunshan, and Jiashan on the 8th, and also attacked the Communist army's rear supply stations in the Hangzhou and Zhenjiang areas. A total of more than 500 Communist troops were killed or wounded, more than 100 wooden boats were destroyed, and more than 20 vehicles were burned. Near Zhitang in Taicang, a Communist army command post was destroyed. Aerial observation on the 8th showed that the Communist army's actions were not as densely packed as before, but had become scattered marching, seemingly because they had suffered great damage from the air attacks in recent days and had made rapid changes.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of President Chiang</h3>
<p>— Zhou Hongtao</p>
<p>This article is a reply from Mr. Zhou Hongtao, Secretary of the Tax Bureau and attendant to President Chiang, in response to an inquiry from his friends in Fenghua regarding the President's recent situation. Our newspaper has obtained the original letter and is urgently publishing it for our readers.</p>
<p>Mr. ×× and Mr. ××:</p>
<p>After communicating with Mr. ×× in Tongzhou on the evening of April 24th, at dawn the next morning, we bid farewell to our hometown and proceeded to Xidian. From Xiangshan Port, we boarded a warship and left the province with the season. While packing our luggage and after setting off, I felt an infinite sense of attachment to the beloved people and scenery of our hometown. Our departure will surely cause panic and disappointment among the elders, brothers, sisters, and brethren in the locality. Over the past three months, Mr. Chiang's concern for local security, economy, culture, and education, coupled with the local people's respect and affection for Mr. Chiang, has fostered a deeper bond between us. His mood must be very heavy and saddened. He is exceptionally worried and uneasy about issues such as local security, the Tianyi Pavilion's collection of books, and the revision of the Fenghua County Annals. However, Mr. Chiang is the leader of the nation. Although he is currently out of office, the country and the government still need him to call upon the people and support the nation's united struggle to complete the revolution. He cannot remain isolated in a corner, depriving the nation of his encouragement and guidance. Driven by patriotism, a sense of justice, and the urging of various party, government, and military circles, he can no longer enjoy a leisurely life in the countryside. In his "Message to the Compatriots" on April 27th, he said: "Zhongzheng takes full responsibility for the past political and economic shortcomings and the failure of the military campaigns against the bandits, which have resulted in our compatriots suffering the ravages and killings by the Communist bandits… This is due to my personal lack of virtue and ability. Because I have a particularly deep understanding of the Communist Party's conspiracies and atrocities, I feel especially guilty and pained by the nation's plight and the people's suffering. However, I will never waver in my belief in saving the nation and the people, and I am confident that we will be able to rescue our compatriots from the Communist iron curtain and return them to freedom and prosperity… Compatriots! The nation's peril and individual disasters are imminent… Eleven years ago, Nanjing was abandoned, and the government moved west… Today, Nanjing is abandoned, and the government moves south, which will become our only turning point in the anti-Communist struggle… Final success belongs to those who persevere to the end." This fully explains his desire and purpose for leaving his hometown this time. I believe that after reading this, everyone will understand Mr. Chiang's mood and state of mind at this time, and also understand the reason for his swift departure and his failure to bid farewell to everyone.</p>
<p>Since the abandonment of Nanjing, the enemy has launched a fierce offensive along the Jinghu Railway and the Jinghang National Highway, splitting up the attack on Shanghai and Hangzhou. News of defeats at the front lines has been continuous. Shanghai residents have been startled several times a day, with rumors flying everywhere. Business transactions in stores are scarce, and people are panicking. The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route is especially congested, with many dependents of fellow villagers returning to their hometowns. All forms of external transportation are in the same state. Prices are falling rapidly relative to the surging silver dollar. Refugees from all over the country are congregating in the urban areas. Amidst such tense circumstances, we followed Mr. Chiang to Shanghai, precisely at noon on April 26th. The warship anchored in the river near the suburbs. Immediately, local military and political figures boarded the ship to greet Mr. Chiang. The small living room on the ship became a temporary reception room, filled with guests. They were all exceptionally excited and, filled with enthusiasm, reported to Mr. Chiang on the general military and political situation, as if they were seeing a long-separated father or elder brother. Witnessing this tense yet intimate meeting, we on the side were nearly moved to tears. The next day, even more guests came to visit. Therefore, Mr. Chiang decided to move to Shanghai in order to converse with his friends and subordinates. We also took our simple luggage ashore and worked in a small house near the river. The local evening newspapers also carried the news of Mr. Chiang's arrival in Shanghai. Several old colleagues also came to see us. After warmly shaking hands with each other, they all said, "It's rare for you to come to Shanghai. We feel very comforted in our hearts. Today, business in the shops is much better than yesterday and the day before." Under such circumstances, day after day, we have unknowingly stayed for five days. The war situation has stabilized west of Kunshan, and Shanghai is gradually recovering its original prosperity. Under the persuasion of various parties, and because Mr. Chiang himself is reluctant to leave the people of Shanghai, we really do not know how much longer we will stay.</p>
<p>Judging from the fortifications around Shanghai, they have been constructed over a considerable period of time, and the military strength is also quite formidable. The internal food reserves are sufficient for three months. At the same time, according to friends in the municipal government, there is a great hope of obtaining material assistance from the United States. However, based on common sense, the only concern lies in the above-mentioned issues. Because Shanghai's population is too large, and the vast majority are engaged in commerce, if the enemy approaches, fuel and food will be scarce, factories will close, and commerce will cease, then the citizens will have nothing to live on. Therefore, in defending a city, the internal economic problems are as important as the military problems. To overcome this difficulty, cooperation between the government and the people is essential. I hope that Shanghai will overcome the current difficulties and fulfill its mission as an anti-Communist base.</p>
<p>Recently, the provincial government retreated through Ningbo, and Ningbo must be very tense. Looking afar at the Yong River, I cannot help but feel nostalgic. Judging from the current enemy situation, the Yong area is not suitable for military operations, and I believe that local security can be ensured. You, gentlemen, are the voice of the local people, and you should make every effort to promote cooperation between the military and the people, which is essential for the party and the country, and for the local area. All of this should be clearly understood and does not require further explanation from me.</p>
<p>I was born here, grew up here, and received my education here. My feelings for my hometown are therefore especially deep. My heart is filled with emotions that I cannot suppress. Therefore, I am taking advantage of my spare time late at night to write this letter to you, gentlemen, to express my feelings of parting, to extend my greetings to all the elders, brothers, sisters, and brethren, and to express my wish that the people of our hometown will continue to love Mr. Chiang. I wonder if you, gentlemen, agree?</p>
<p>Traveling and working are busy. This letter is written hastily and without proper formality. Please forgive me. I will write again later. I respectfully wish you good health.</p>
<p>Midnight, May 1st, from Shanghai</p>
<h3>Editorial: A Turning Point to Break the German Stalemate</h3>
<p>As the "Cold War" between the East and the West intensifies with the signing of the Atlantic Charter, a message of world peace suddenly emerges internationally: the Berlin blockade, which has been disputed for ten months, and the blockade between East and West Germany will be lifted, and all traffic will return to normal. This is not only a blessing for the German people, who can avoid the painful division of their homeland, but also the most gratifying event internationally. After the German stalemate is broken, other international problems can be easily solved. Looking ahead to the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting to be held in Paris on the 30th of this month, it will surely transform the international tension into harmony, and make further contributions to the creation of world peace.</p>
<p>However, we must not hold excessive expectations for the foreign ministers' meeting to be held at the end of the month; as long as this four-nation foreign ministers' meeting can thoroughly, reasonably, and fairly resolve the German problem, it will be of immense benefit to the future of peace in Europe. Therefore, we urgently hope that the German problem can be thoroughly resolved first. The establishment of the "prototype government" in West Germany, although it can serve as a precursor to the reunification of Germany, the thorough resolution of the German problem still awaits the joint efforts of the four foreign ministers. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on the 6th, the Soviet Union may propose the following three conditions for the German problem: (1) Unify the entire Germany under a central German government; (2) The four powers accelerate the withdrawal of their occupying forces stationed in Germany; (3) Expedite the completion of a peace treaty with Germany. These three conditions, after the Soviet Union lifts the blockade of Berlin, can still be accepted by Britain and the United States as a basis for discussion at the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting, so that this Berlin problem, which has been deadlocked for ten months, will have a turning point. Regardless of one's stance, this turning point should be welcomed. As reported by Reuters' diplomatic correspondent: European capitals, upon hearing the news that the Berlin blockade will be lifted, all expressed their joy: their happy mood exceeded even the joy of hearing the good news of the end of World War II in 1945.</p>
<p>In fact, the Berlin blockade problem should have been resolved long ago. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, the blockade of Berlin was originally a retaliatory measure, and it has now lost its original purpose; continuing it will only increase the suffering of the German people, so why not lift it as soon as possible? This is even more the case for Britain and the United States. The blockade of Berlin increases the cost of the Anglo-American airlift, which is equivalent to increasing the burden on the people of Britain and the United States. As long as the Soviet Union is willing to lift the blockade first, other issues can be discussed at length. On January 30th of this year, Stalin proposed a plan for world peace to American reporter Smith, the main points of which were four: (1) The Soviet Union is willing to issue a joint statement with the United States, guaranteeing that neither country intends to resort to war; (2) The Soviet Union is prepared to cooperate with the United States in taking measures formulated to fulfill this peaceful partnership, such as gradual disarmament; (3) If the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France agree to delay the establishment of a West German government before the foreign ministers' meeting is held to review the entire German problem, then the Soviet Union is prepared to lift the Berlin blockade, but the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France should also lift restrictions on transportation and trade at the same time. (4) Stalin agreed to meet with Truman to review US-Soviet relations. It is obvious that the Soviets intend to lift the Berlin blockade. As long as the United States also has this intention, it could have been lifted long ago.</p>
<p>However, the United States has always doubted the sincerity of the Soviet Union. Truman has repeatedly refused to meet with Stalin, and the State Department has demanded that the Soviet Union demonstrate its sincerity with facts; therefore, the attitude of the United States is also very clear. In short, the United States has three demands for the resolution of the German problem: (1) The United States is unwilling to abandon other countries and conduct direct negotiations with the Soviet Union; (2) International disputes should be resolved through normal diplomatic channels; (3) If the Soviet Union wants to resolve the Berlin problem, it must first lift the Berlin blockade. In this way, the two sides have once again encountered the "issue of precedence", and the situation has remained deadlocked; the hope for a peaceful resolution of the Berlin problem has once again been shattered. It was not until news came from Lake Success last month that Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, suggested to the American representative: "If the Western countries can set a date acceptable to the Soviet Union for holding a four-nation foreign ministers' meeting, then the Soviet Union will lift the Berlin blockade before the foreign ministers' meeting." This is exactly the ideal that the Western countries have been seeking. Therefore, after a brief contact between the two sides, an agreement was immediately reached, giving the Berlin problem a turning point.</p>
<p>The turning point in the German problem is also a turning point in world peace, which is worth cherishing by all countries in the world. In particular, the politicians and diplomats of Western countries should seize this fleeting opportunity. Not only should they take this opportunity to break the stalemate in the German problem, but they should also use this as a turning point in the creation of world peace. Even with regard to the three conditions proposed by the Soviet Union, whether it is unifying Germany, withdrawing occupying forces, or negotiating a peace treaty with Germany, none of them are things that Western countries are not seeking. The politicians and diplomats of Western countries bear the heavy responsibility of world peace and security, and they should broaden their vision, use their wisdom, seize the opportunity, dispel the dark clouds and gloom in the international arena, shed the sunshine of peace, and allow hundreds of millions of people around the world to feel the warmth of peace.</p>

<h3>Western Three Nations to Hold Preparatory Meeting to Review Common Policy Towards Germany; Palace in Western Suburbs of Paris Selected as Meeting Place for Four Foreign Ministers; US Opposes Withdrawal of Occupying Forces from Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 8th] The United States, Britain, and France quietly revealed today that before the opening of the Paris four-nation foreign ministers' meeting, the three countries will hold a preliminary meeting to review their common policies toward the West and Germany, but not to jointly deal with the Soviet Union. Secretary of State Acheson announced that he will dispatch Jessup, the monitor for Europe, and Bohlen, an advisor to the State Department, to Paris at the end of next week to meet with representatives of the United States and France. Acheson himself will depart for Paris a week later to formally meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 7th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that when the four powers' foreign ministers meet in Paris on May 23rd to discuss the German problem, they will use the luxurious Rose Marble Palace in western Paris as the meeting place.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 7th] A senior US diplomatic official revealed on the 7th that the United States will frankly reject any Soviet proposals for the rapid withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany. He said that the State Department is drafting a counter-proposal so that it can be immediately put forward when the Soviet Union raises this demand at the four powers' foreign ministers' meeting. He said that the United States is still pursuing a long-term occupation policy. Since this person is a confidential advisor to Secretary of State Acheson, and has recently participated in drafting the US military strategy to be adopted at the four powers' meeting, and will certainly be a member of the US delegation, this view can be regarded as authoritative. Although signs behind the Iron Curtain indicate that the Soviet Union's military strategy will be to win the support of German nationalists, the Soviet Union will obviously undermine the Western plan to establish a West German state, and this military strategy relies on the proposal for the rapid withdrawal of all Allied occupying forces. This official said that the United States is firmly convinced that all such Soviet plans will fail. First, this move is opposed by the Western countries, especially France, because they are worried about the resurgence of German aggression; second, many Germans do not want the US military to withdraw. Finally, he warned, "We cannot hope to completely resolve the German problem at the Paris meeting."</p>
<h3>East German Leaders Propose to West Germany to Discuss Steps to Unify Germany; Preparations for Lifting Blockade Almost Completed</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 7th] As Soviet and Western transportation personnel were negotiating the timetable for lifting the blockade last night, the "German People's Council," which claims to represent the entire Germany, suddenly suggested that representatives from West Germany meet in Brunswick in the British zone to draft a plan for the political, economic, and cultural unification of Germany, so as to submit it to the four powers' foreign ministers' meeting in Paris on May 23rd.</p>
<p>The proposal also called for the swift conclusion of a peace treaty and the withdrawal of occupying forces. The proposal was signed by Noske, Kastner, and Grotewohl, representatives of the East German Christian Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, and the Socialist Unity Party, respectively. It pointed out that any attempt to create a fait accompli by establishing a West German government before the foreign ministers' meeting would deepen the division between East and West Germany. According to the Western powers, they have repeatedly stated that the agreement reached by the four powers in New York should not interfere with the plan to establish a West German republic, which is scheduled for this summer, but the manner in which the West German constitution is formulated can be applied to the entire Germany after an agreement is reached by the four powers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 7th] Authoritative sources said that the Western countries and the Soviet authorities have made the first contact in Berlin to discuss the details of lifting the blockade, but the content of the discussion is kept extremely secret. At the same time, the British and American representatives of the military transportation agency in the Frankfurt dual occupation zone have also arrived here to discuss the details of lifting the blockade.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 7th] A British spokesman claimed that British and American transportation officials have informed the German railway authorities that they are preparing to resume train service to Berlin at midnight on May 11th. They also instructed the railway authorities to collect as many train cars as possible in order to transport coal, food, raw materials, and consumer goods to Berlin.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 7th] The Soviet zone government in Berlin announced tonight that it is willing to immediately restore the supply of electricity to West Berlin after the Berlin blockade is lifted.</p>
<h3>Clay to Leave Berlin for US on the 15th</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 7th] Clay, the outgoing US military governor of Germany, is scheduled to leave Berlin by plane on May 15th, the third day after the Berlin blockade is lifted. He told reporters today that he was very happy to see the Berlin blockade lifted before he left office. He believes that there is a great possibility that the Paris four powers' foreign ministers' meeting will reach an agreement. Clay also said that he did not expect to have the opportunity to say goodbye to the senior officials of the Soviet military government before his departure. If he were to meet them, he would only say goodbye and did not intend to hold any talks. He also revealed that he had never met Marshal Chuikov, who replaced General Sokolovsky as the commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces after the latter was transferred. When talking about his personal plans for the future, he said that he would go fishing after retiring on June 1st and had no other plans. He is scheduled to leave Berlin by plane on May 15th, the day he retires, and will stay in Washington for two weeks to wait for the day of his retirement. Then he will take his wife to spend the summer by a mountain stream. He has no house in the United States, so his address is uncertain. He also stated that he has no intention of writing any memoirs at this time.</p>
<h3>Candidates for President and Vice President of West German Provisional Government</h3>
<p>[United Press Bonn, 7th] Well-informed political circles here said that Adenauer of the Christian Democratic Party will be the president of the West German provisional government, and Schmid will be the vice president. Manscher of the Socialist Party will be the interior minister, Kaiser will be the labor minister, and Aschoff of the Free Democratic Party will be the finance minister. The Bonn Constitutional Assembly elected an 18-member "executive committee" of non-Communist parties on the evening of the 6th to temporarily carry out West German political affairs until a government elected by universal suffrage is established. It is generally expected that the executive committee will submit a proposal for the conclusion of a German peace treaty, so that it can be discussed at the peace conference to be convened in Paris.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Actively Mines Uranium in the Czechoslovak-German Border Area</h3>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 7th] Jan Papanek, the former Czechoslovak representative to the United Nations, who resigned after the Communist coup and became the secretary of the newly organized Free Czech Council, declared here today that he had received secret reports from home that the Soviet Union is now intensifying the mining of uranium in the Joachimsthal uranium mine. The mine is located on the Czech-German border, and the richness of the ore vein is the best in Europe.</p>
<h3>Greek Government Urges Communists to Surrender Unconditionally</h3>
<p>US to Provide Additional $200 Million in Aid to Greece and Turkey</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Athens, 7th] The Athens News Agency today published the Greek government's first comment on the guerrilla's attempt to ask the United Nations to intervene in the Greek civil war. The news agency said, "The work of pacification in Greece is a clear and simple problem, that is, the unconditional surrender of the bandit party and the cessation of destructive Communist rebellion. This view has been reiterated today by the Greek government when commenting on the Slavic Communist attempts to send so-called representatives of the democratic government to New York to discuss the Greek pacification problem. The same sources have also said that if the bandit party wants to end the war, it can only contact the Athens government directly. The Slavic representatives' attempt at the United Nations to make the United Nations intervene in Greek internal affairs was already rejected at the last UN General Assembly in Paris."</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 7th] Senior government officials said that the government will ask Congress to approve at least $200 million in appropriations for the next fiscal year to strengthen the combat capabilities of Greece and Turkey. The request will be made at the same time as the government formally submits its $1.45 billion plan for military assistance to foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Pearl Buck Opposes War</h3>
<p>Indicates That the American People Are Entering a Dangerous Path, Mainly Opposing Accepting the Orders of Warmongers</p>
<p>[United Press Hartford, Connecticut, 8th] Famous female writer Pearl Buck said today that the Asian people are the most ideal object for world peace. Only the people of China, Thailand, Indonesia, Burma, and India have a philosophical awareness of the world's great unity. The Western world is still in its infancy and cannot make the idea of great unity. American military leaders are leading us on a path of hypocrisy and danger. We must oppose accepting the orders of warmongers. If the government is determined to promote militarism, we should openly oppose it. When mothers openly advocate that their sons join the army, there must be shortcomings in our country's family system.</p>
<h3>Member States Should Have Absolute Freedom to Restore Diplomatic Relations with Spain; UN Political Committee Passes Brazilian Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 8th] The UN Political Committee passed the proposal submitted by Brazil, supported by Bolivia, Colombia, and the Secretary-General, on the 7th by a vote of 25 to 16, granting UN member states the absolute freedom to restore diplomatic relations with Spain. Sixteen countries abstained during the vote. Both the United States and Britain were among those who abstained (the Soviet bloc and India opposed). However, when the proposal is submitted to the UN General Assembly next week, it does not appear to be able to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. At the same time, the committee immediately rejected Poland's proposal to strengthen the United Nations' 1946 resolution on breaking off diplomatic relations with Spain, as well as declaring a ban on the shipment of arms into Spain.</p>
<h3>Hyderabad Problem Serious and Already Threatening Peace</h3>

He has confidence in the future situation, but said, "There are still many difficulties to overcome." Republic delegation leader Mr. Roem stated: The issue of Dutch troop withdrawal from Yogyakarta will be one of the main issues when both parties discuss how to implement the agreement in the future. Mr. Roem stated that he was unaware of the news from Singapore stating that the leader of the Republic's provisional government exiled in Sumatra, Mr. Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, said that he would refuse to accept the ceasefire order until the Dutch troops had completely withdrawn from the Republic's territory. And he said he "believed" that Mr. Sjafruddin Prawiranegara also agreed to the agreement reached today.

<h3>Burma Strengthens Border Guards to Prevent Collaboration Between Chinese and Burmese Communist Forces, Small Groups of Chinese Communists Have Infiltrated Burmese Territory and Then Returned</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rangoon, 7th] A Burmese government spokesperson announced today that Burma has doubled its border guards with China to prevent the collaboration of Chinese and Burmese communist forces. Small groups of Chinese communists have detoured through French Vietnam and infiltrated Burmese territory near Gangdong. After being suppressed by the Burmese army, it is claimed that although communism has recently emerged here, it is not believed that the Burmese Communist Party's actions are in accordance with Chinese Communist instructions, and no important figures from the Burmese Communist Party have left the country recently. The Chinese Communist Party may have contacted its minor groups, but these groups have no power in Burma and are not recognized by the important leaders of the Burmese Communist Party. Burma, governed by Prime Minister Thakin Nu, is not in danger of communization. The Burmese Communist Party is currently divided into two major parties, the Red Flag Party (Trotskyist) led by Thakin Soe and the White Flag Party (Stalinist) led by Than Tun. The Red Flag Party was banned in January 1947, and the White Flag Party was banned in March 1948, becoming underground groups, each fighting against the government. Recently, it was reported that the two parties planned to unite in Prome, a transportation hub, but it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 8th] The Burmese government gazette stated that the Burmese government army has recovered two villages occupied by the Communist Party in the Sandoway District on both sides of Burma. Near Bassein in the Irrawaddy River, the government army and the Karen rebels fought fiercely for two hours.</p>

<h3>Rumor of Stalin's Secret Telegram to Washington, Willing to Meet with Truman, The United States Says British and French Leaders Should Also Participate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] The Labour Party's "People's Daily" reported that Marshal Stalin had sent a secret telegram to Truman suggesting that they hold a face-to-face meeting to resolve world problems. The newspaper published this news in a very prominent position, and said that although President Truman did not say yes or no, he had informed Moscow that if the next Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference could have good results, and could simultaneously invite British Prime Minister Attlee and French Prime Minister Queuille to participate, then he could also agree to talk to Stalin. The newspaper said that Truman was very cautious and did not want to give the impression that he was bypassing Britain and France to contact the Soviet Union alone, but that Berlin and Washington were only directly negotiating between the United States and the Soviet Union, dividing the world into two blocs, respectively ruled by Washington and Moscow.</p>
<h3>A Discussion of the American Democratic Party (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Song Guihuang</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>Wilson completely revived the Jacksonian Democratic Party of the past. This former President of Princeton University has always maintained a stern attitude, and he has indeed proved to be a political leader with the courage to speak boldly, act with fearless spirit, and educate this generation of Democrats, making them believe that the government should overcome all difficulties to protect civilians.</p>
<p>After the end of World War I, Wilson's domestic reform plan stopped, and the post-war reactionary situation created the Republican atmosphere era under Harding and Coolidge. The collapse in 1929 proved that the prosperity in the 1930s was not sustainable. When the depression descended on the American people from 1930 to 1931, the long lines of people waiting for bread lengthened, and the homeless people built shacks in urban landfills, the two-party system encountered its most terrible test since the Civil War. In 1932, the situation showed that the nation would produce a great president from the Democratic Party. However, if the Democratic Party wanted to solve economic problems, and its ability was no better than the Republican Party, then the people who had survived a narrow escape would seek solutions outside the two-party system.</p>
<p>However, the Democratic Party did produce a leader who could solve the economic crisis. Franklin Roosevelt was able to combine Jefferson's political acumen, Jackson's fighting spirit, and Wilson's ability to inspire people to move forward. The so-called "New Deal" was not without its illogical and contradictory aspects. Since Jackson, no president has been as hated by the people as Franklin Roosevelt, and the remnants of this hatred still exist today. However, the "New Deal" did cure the nervous breakdown that paralyzed the American people in the 1940s. For many years, Roosevelt's shortcomings disappeared in the panorama of his success, because at that time, the American people's fighting hearts and democratic way of life had been restored.</p>
<p>As the leader of the party, Roosevelt strengthened the policies established by Jefferson and Jackson and restored by Bryan and Wilson, as the main policy of the Democratic Party. The liberals of the north, the giants of industry and commerce in the city, and the labor movement, which were originally supported by the farmers of the north, at this time returned to the south as their base, forming the vanguard of the "New Deal" forces. However, the "New Deal's" headlong rush also had a damaging effect on the Democratic Party. During the Civil War, people in the south (including industry and commerce) all obeyed the Democratic Party, but during Roosevelt's administration, the conservatives in the south increasingly expressed displeasure. Only his personal genius could keep them from defecting, but this success was also increasingly diminished. President Truman had no success in this regard.</p>
<p>In short, traditionally, the Democratic Party has been a combination of different elements from the north and south, with internal strife occurring from time to time. Only when a strong leader emerges can it become an effective tool. This political party is also characterized by having strong leaders. Whether the tradition from Lincoln to Roosevelt can win again in the Republican Party can only be seen in the future.</p>
<p>Generally, people believe that the two parties in the United States do not represent any ideology or policy, but looking at the history of the two parties, it is known that this is not the case. The two parties have very different attitudes towards bourgeois rule and the way the president leads. However, in reality, the two parties do not represent completely different and mutually incompatible interests, and this is obviously the source of the strength of the American two-party system. Some people hope that the members of the two parties can still be strictly divided into free and conservative directions, thinking that this is the only way to be logical. Looking back to the time of the 1860 election, the two parties once strictly represented different interests, but after the Republican Party's election failure, the members saw that the party had no hope of seizing power, and as a result, there was no other way but to leave the party. The American two-party system has always maintained a delicate relationship, because the policies of the two parties can be changed, and the members can also advance and retreat, but they will never be greatly hostile to each other, creating an insoluble situation. Compromise is needed within and between the two parties at all times. This is an advantage in the American party system, because in the final analysis, the so-called democratic government is a political system that uses compromise and consent.</p>
<p>Needless to say, political parties are essential for political freedom. A single voting system, as manifested in the totalitarian politics of Nazism and communism, is just a pleasant name for dictatorship. In the past, the American flexible two-party system has always met the needs of American democratic politics, and it is not unreasonable for us to hope that this system can continue to meet the needs of the American people.

<h3>The Origins and Development of the Karen Rebellion in Burma</h3>
<p>— Xu Siren</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Yangon] It was on the afternoon of November 19th last year that Mr. U Tun Pa, Minister of Propaganda of the Burmese Government, held a press conference at the Burmese Press Association. At the meeting, the host, U Tun Pa, said to the reporters present with a nervous face: "...Everyone, the purpose of today's reception is to report to you the occurrence of an extremely regrettable thing. The manufacturer of this thing should not only not, but also be too unintelligent, so the Burmese government has disregarded everything to announce this thing." After Mr. U finished this short speech, he continued to send each reporter a printed picture speech. The written speech wrote: "...What I want to tell everyone here is that Mr. Campbell, the Myanmar correspondent of the London Daily Mail, was arrested by the Myanmar government the day before yesterday based on the National Defense Ordinance. The reason why the Myanmar government arrested Mr. Campbell was because Mr. Kang had incited the rebellion of ethnic minorities in Myanmar, and caused the conflict between the ethnic groups in Myanmar. The Myanmar government has obtained solid evidence of Mr. Kang's behavior. The reason is that in August of this year, Mr. Kang once entrusted Mr. Simon, a pilot of British Overseas Airways Corporation, to bring a letter sealed with fire paint to Colonel Darrel, a British soldier in Calcutta, India. The content of that letter contained the following sentences: "...The letter entrusted by Mr. has been sent to Mr. SS yesterday because the recipient is not here. Mr. M is waiting for Mr. to send arms and ammunition at No. 1. Regarding the news of the two ships opened by Mr. Boris's friend, Mr. Q has been notified. According to Mr. SS, the situation is not good. If no foreign aid is received, it may be difficult to support it for another fifteen days. I have been to his headquarters and learned that ethnic minorities are capable of providing full assistance. The friends on the mountain are not only not developing southward, but are making trouble for themselves. Now it is impossible to hope that they will assist. It may not be possible to enter Yangon. K and others are now only consolidating the towns they occupy. They may use the occupied areas as a base to negotiate with the government. They feel the lack of weapons, and the government confiscated many of their previous weapons before their rebellion, thus weakening their power..." The reason why the secret of this letter was leaked was because Mr. Simon, who Mr. Campbell entrusted him to bring the letter, was a member of the British Progressive Socialist Party and firmly opposed British interference in Myanmar's internal affairs. Colonel Darrel, the recipient, was considered to be in charge of the rebellion of the Lun people in Myanmar. Therefore, Mr. Simon secretly opened Mr. Campbell's letter to read. When he discovered Mr. Campbell's secret, he immediately copied down the content of Mr. Kang's original letter and reported it to Mr. U Pa Ken, the Burmese ambassador to Pakistan. After receiving the report, Mr. U Pa Ken quickly notified the Burmese government to take action to detain Mr. Campbell. When Mr. Campbell was arrested, another document addressed to Colonel Darrel was found on him, which stated: "...I recently met with Mr. Oliver at the Karen General Assembly, and submitted the letter you sent to him requesting money. He has promised to send the money to you. I haven't seen him for seven or eight days since that day. It wasn't until yesterday morning that he brought the news to be published in the newspaper. They have now occupied areas from Mao Shijiadang to Boda, etc. (Editor's note: Mao Shijiadang is a market area in Burmese-Siamese)</p>
<p>They are also repairing the Japanese-built airport. Also, they have recently occupied the surroundings of Zhitang, Mao Luomian, Basen and other places, and have organized administrative institutions in Mao Luomian. Yesterday, a government plane was detained by them, and they can expect to occupy Dan Lao and Browm within days. Oliver said: They need arms very urgently, and are hoping that you will send them to Mao Luomian by sea or air. Your friends are also looking forward to sending money. To be honest, the current situation is not very satisfactory. Our friends have not taken thorough action. My actions in Yangon are being monitored, and it is very difficult to send news to Calcutta. The Red Karen do not help the Karen in the plains because of conflicts in Guan religion. Smithon, who joined the Burmese government and was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Burmese Army, does not cooperate with us as we expected. He was simply bought by the Burmese government. In short, if Fubert cannot provide all the tools that the city needs, I am afraid our plan will fail..." After Mr. Campbell was arrested, everyone focused their attention on the development of the matter. Everyone had long expected that the development of the matter would be nothing more than the British government issuing a solemn statement saying that Mr. Campbell's actions were personal and had absolutely nothing to do with the British government.</p>
<p>As expected, the statement from the British Embassy in Myanmar came the day after Mr. Kang was arrested. Needless to say, what he said was what everyone had expected, saying that Mr. Kang's incident was entirely a personal action by Mr. Kang and Colonel Darrel. The British ordered that they did not know anything, and the Burmese government could punish Mr. Kang with the punishment he deserved. It also said that Mr. Kang was captured and handed over to the Burmese government by the British Embassy in Myanmar itself. Some people say that this is Britain's "sacrificing the small self to take care of the big self." Otherwise, the matter has already been exposed, and the clear and accurate physical evidence that the British are helping the Karen people to resist the Burmese government has fallen into the hands of the Burmese government. If the British had not sacrificed a "small self" Campbell, and made such a 180-degree turn, how would the British face the world?</p>
<p>Implementing the Rebellion</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the British instigated the Karen to resist the Burmese government, it is true that the Burmese Karen are using force to fight for self-government. As early as a few days after Myanmar's independence last year, the Myanmar government suddenly received a petition from the Karen demanding that Yong Sheng County, Khan Da Fuli County, and Bosheng County in the Delta, and the Dana Shao Ling District in southern Myanmar, etc., be designated as the Karen State. This sudden request really made the Myanmar government unable to figure it out. Because in the process of Myanmar striving for independence, although the Karen did not make every effort, they did not openly oppose it. When Myanmar gained independence and formed a government, the Karen also sent people to participate. It was really unexpected that the Karen would come up with such a sudden change. Afterwards, although the government used a pacification policy to temporarily suppress this problem, the Karen's demand for division has been brewing. In August of last year, the Karen in the Delta, taking advantage of the government's busy response to the rebellion of the Burmese Communist Party and the White Armband Volunteer Army, took advantage of the fire to rob, and used force to drive away the government administrative officials in several Karen areas in the Delta, and organized administrative institutions by the Karen people themselves, implementing regional autonomy, and at the same time using force to defend these places, not allowing the government army to invade. At that time, the government was too busy to cope with the Burmese Communist Party and the White Volunteer Army, so it had to yield and comply. Later, although the government established a investigation committee and set out to investigate the public opinion in the areas that the Karen requested to be divided, and announced the government's policy towards the Karen, saying that as long as the Karen's demands were reasonable, within the possible scope, the government would allow the Karen's demands as much as possible. However, this promise, which was similar to a blank check, failed to satisfy the Karen, and therefore the Karen unrest continued to spread; however, at first it was just a local disturbance, and they did not dare to openly raise the Karen flag. It was not until after the Campbell incident occurred that they slowly changed from semi-covered to public. First, on January 10 of this year, the Karen near Mao Luomian in southern Myanmar began to formally demand the establishment of a state and division of governance by force. The Burmese government naturally refused to do so. Therefore, the ethnic war between the Karen and Burmese ethnic groups also broke out. Mao Luomian was occupied when the incident occurred. Following this, the important town of Barlin in the Delta also fell. More than a thousand Karen troops in Baulum (an important town in western Myanmar) also rebelled. The Karen in Mandalay, the Burmese capital, also joined forces with the Burmese Communists to occupy the Burmese summer resort of Miao, which is 43 miles away from the Burmese capital, and Dong Gua, Min Sala, Renwei Shen... and other places below the Burmese capital. Even the Karen people in Dama (five miles from Yangon), Yin Sheng (thirteen miles from Yangon), and Liju (twenty-five miles from Yangon) in the suburbs of Yangon rebelled. The port of Duandi in the Delta had long been occupied by the Karen station, causing all maritime transportation in the Delta to be unable to navigate. The Karen agitators in the suburbs of Yangon originally wanted to occupy Yangon, but fortunately the government discovered it early and was able to intercept it at Dama. The fighting in the suburbs of Yangon has been going on for almost a month since the reporter wrote this manuscript, but the government army has still not been able to recapture Yin Sheng. The unrest in the Mandalay area is also intensifying, and Prime Minister Thakin Nu insists that this war is a war between good people and bad people, not a war between the Karen and Burmese ethnic groups, and is absolutely unwilling to resolve it peacefully. Based on this situation, the war may still have to continue. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Street Vendors Spring Up Everywhere; Everything for Sale Available; Actual Business Hours 15 Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In recent days, the number of people setting up "street stalls" to sell goods along the roads of this city has increased unprecedentedly. This type of "street stall" market was originally limited to a few locations in the city, such as Qiujiang Road, Wuding Road, Laoximen, and the Central Market on Nanjing Road, but currently, they are springing up everywhere like mushrooms after rain. In particular, the section of Xizang Road from Nicheng Bridge in the north to Nanyang Bridge in the south, and the section of Jinji East Road from Baxian Bridge to Dongxin Bridge are connected to each other, with almost no space left on the sidewalks, making it difficult for pedestrians to move. Its grand scale is even more lively than the "glass cabinet stalls" that swept the city after the victory. The goods displayed for sale on these street stalls are of various kinds and have everything, including various daily necessities, woolen and silk fabrics, leather shoes, medicines, books, cosmetics, mechanical parts, clothing, etc., almost like an open-air department store.</p>
<p>There are four types of stall vendors</p>
<p>According to a brief survey by reporters, among the people engaged in setting up these street stalls, those who sell family treasures because they cannot make a living due to the dissolution of the service organization account for 10%; current employees of various factories and firms who set up stalls to sell some of the in-kind goods they receive when they are paid account for 30%; those who originally regarded this type of street stall as a fixed occupation, or who have only moved to the central district from other places, account for 20%; and those who were originally mobile "scalpers" buying and selling silver dollars but switched to street stalls due to restrictions of the official orders account for 40%.</p>
<p>Sweatshirts and socks sell the best</p>
<p>Because the sources of goods for sale by these four types of people are different, the price difference is very large. On average, summer supplies are the most expensive, and items such as sweatshirts and socks sell the best. Most of the customers are housewives and military and government personnel. As for the location of their stalls, it is impossible to fix every day. Because there are many people and the place is narrow, they must rush out to occupy a site after the end of martial law in the early morning, and those who arrive later cannot find a place. The time for setting up stalls is mostly from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM, with actual business hours of 15 hours, which is the longest business hours of all businesses in Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>Disturbance at the Golden Theater; Gunshot Fired, Fortunately No One Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At the Golden Theater at the intersection of Jinling Road and Xizang South Road, at around 10:00 AM yesterday, a special morning show was screened because it was a Sunday. Unexpectedly, at around 10:35 AM, more than a dozen people wearing golden uniforms demanded to enter without tickets. After the theater staff's advice was ineffective, six people in golden uniforms rushed into the cashier's room, and without asking why, they used leather belts on their bodies to violently beat staff members Chen Fukui, Pei Xiaoping, and Zhao Yanghua. Later, the manager of the theater, Tang Rong, stood up and fired a gun, but he was slapped twice. Before leaving, he fired a shot, fortunately without injuring anyone. After the Songshan Police Branch Bureau received the report, a large number of police officers rushed to the scene, but the troublemakers had all fled.</p>
<h3>HMS London Arrives in Hong Kong; Journalists Invited for Tour</h3>
<p>Official Reports Details of Attack</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 7th] The British warship HMS London arrived in Hong Kong at 9:30 AM on the 7th and invited reporters on board for a tour at 10:00 AM. Responsible personnel from various departments of the warship reported to the reporters on the incident of being shelled by the Communist army on the Yangtze River, stating that the warship had more than four artillery battles with the Communist army, firing 477 shells. At that time, in addition to returning fire to the Communist army, the warship had to rescue injured personnel from other ships sailing downstream.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Lujiabang on the Edge of the Flames of War; Refugees Flee in Droves; Schools Continue to Teach</h3>
<p>Since the Jinghu train terminates near Lujiabang, this remote town has become a vital transit point on the edge of the flames of war. The town is a little way from the Shanghai-Suzhou Road (the bridges at Anting, etc., are damaged and cannot be used. We hope that the people there will quickly find a convenient way for pedestrians). From the Lujiabang station six miles away, tens of thousands of refugees walk or cross the border by train every day, supporting the old and carrying the young, some are wearing suits and leather shoes, and some are in cheongsams with permed hair. It takes about two days to reach Suzhou via Qiandunjiao from Lujiabang. The local civil defense association and philanthropists are providing tea and porridge, and increasing the number of ferries. Temples and public places are used as refugee shelters, with almost no space left, accepting refugees day and night based on human mutual aid and sympathy. However, there are also a few dim sum shops that cut corners, reduce materials, and raise prices. It is said that profit makes people lose their minds.</p>
<p>The population of Shanghai is being evacuated westward, but there are also several cases of people traveling long distances from Nanjing, Changzhou, and Wuxi, taking a train at the town to go to Shanghai, every day, and the number is not small. Many of them do not have ID cards, leading to hesitation and helplessness on the wrong road.</p>
<p>Every time a train arrives, there are hundreds of workers going to the town to buy food, or exchanging it for real objects such as cigarettes, causing the price of rice to jump several times a day. Whole slaughtered sheep and pork are transported out in large quantities. The local township office and civil defense association have set restrictions due to the increasing number of shoppers.</p>
<p>Hongjun Middle School and Lujia National Elementary School continue to have classes as usual. However, the public grain for elementary school teachers has long been nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Twelve miles away in the direction of Qiandunjiao, there was inhumane behavior of people impersonating soldiers robbing refugees, causing some refugees to sadly turn back, wanting to cry but having no tears. After the security team leader Xu heard about it, he was furious and sent a team to investigate and capture them. Therefore, it has been safe recently, and the act of bullying refugees has slightly diminished.</p>
<h3>Two Notorious Robbers Executed for Continuous Gang Robbery; Three Accomplices Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>

<h3>Gold Industry to Concurrently Engage in Silver Dollar Trading; Doubtful that it Will Start as Scheduled Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is learned that in order to bring the price of silver dollars back on track, the competent authorities, including the Central Bank and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, separately convened responsible persons from the Gold Industry Association of this city last week for talks, ordering the association to prepare to concurrently engage in silver dollar trading, and scheduled to start trading in the gold market today at the same time as gold. Yesterday afternoon, reporters inquired about the details from the association. It was reported that the association authorities did have informal contact with the competent authorities regarding the opening of silver dollar trading. However, whether or not it can be listed for trading on Monday at the same time as gold still depends on whether the official documents from the competent authorities are issued. As of Sunday afternoon, the official documents had not been issued, so it is doubtful that it will be listed for trading as scheduled today. It was also reported that the silver dollar traders in the gold market are still limited to the 107 members currently affiliated with the Gold Industry Association. Whether other stores with silver dollar exchange permits issued by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau can simultaneously enter the market for trading is currently not being considered.</p>
<h3>National Banks to Improve Silver Dollar Issuance Method</h3>
<p>[Huadong News Agency] In recent days, the Central Bank has been issuing silver dollars as much as possible to commercial banks and firms for withdrawals. Each day, silver dollars, fixed-amount banknotes, and silver dollars are issued in three types according to the overnight deposit balance of each bank and firm. Since the issuance began on the 5th, more than 600,000 silver dollars have been issued in the past three days. However, commercial banks and firms have only been issuing banknotes or fixed-amount banknotes to customers for withdrawals in recent days, and rarely issuing silver dollars, so most of the silver dollars issued by the National Bank are still piled up in the warehouses of the banks and firms and have not circulated in the market. The lack of bargaining chips in the market affects the market price. It is heard that the financial authorities are paying close attention to this and have decided to improve the method of issuing silver dollars in order to increase market supply, suppress market prices, and avoid being used by people to hoard and profiteer.</p>
<h3>Passenger Sales Completely Stalled; Unprecedented Difficulties for Industries; Department Store Retail Sales Barely Sufficient to Pay Electricity Bills</h3>
<p>[Huadong News Agency] After the flames of war approached Shanghai, the transportation of this city to the outside world has become increasingly blocked, and industry and commerce have been greatly affected. Not only have passenger sales in North China and the Yangtze River completely stalled, but also nine out of ten of the routes along the two roads have also stalled. Although shipping to South China is still smooth, it is difficult to transport goods to the south due to the lack of berths. Under the current situation of being surrounded on all sides, industry and commerce are facing unprecedented difficulties, and trade in various industries is almost zero. Industries such as customs declaration and transportation are almost on the verge of collapse. At the same time, retail sales in various industries in this city have also seen sales failing because purchasing power is so low. The total retail income of some large companies is not enough to pay the electricity bill. The situation is almost identical to that during the "August 13th" Shanghai War.</p>
<h3>Jeep and Truck Collide; Police Officer Severely Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At around 7:00 AM yesterday, a jeep police car of the Huangpu Police Branch Bureau, driven by driver Sun Keqiang (25 years old, from Northern Jiangsu), was passing Linsen Road and Shaanxi Road when a giant truck, driven by Han Jingxuan (35 years old, from Ningbo), a driver of the Motor Vehicle Brigade of the Ordnance Command of the Jinghu-Hang Garrison Headquarters, suddenly came from the south to the north. Because it was too late to avoid it, it collided with the jeep. Sun Shaoran, a police officer from the Huangpu Branch Bureau, was knocked down after being hit and fell unconscious. Afterwards, the guards at the scene rushed to bring the two drivers back to the Branch Bureau for verification. The injured person was rushed to nearby Yihua Hospital for treatment. It is learned that he was severely shaken, and was still in a coma until dusk.</p>

<h3>Drunkenness Leads to Wife Murder; Three Knife Wounds, One Fatality; Worker Xu Zhengqiu Flees After the Incident</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Worker Xu Zhengqiu, from Hubei, lived at No. 28 Xuanchang Lane, Guihua Road, Shanghai West, i.e. Tokyo Road, and married Dong Tianxiu (36 years old, from Anhui). The couple often quarreled. Yesterday was a Sunday holiday. At around 2:30 PM, Xu was drinking alone and became slightly drunk. Suddenly, he was touched by something on his mind and brought up old matters to Dong. Dong retorted, and a conflict broke out, followed by mutual beatings. Then Xu grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Dong fiercely three times in the chest, abdomen, and ears, half an inch deep, with blood splattering on his clothes. Dong collapsed, barely breathing. Xu knew that he had committed a serious crime and fled without a trace. After someone reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Branch Bureau, Section Chief Zhu ordered the police to rush to the scene to investigate. However, the perpetrator was nowhere to be found. The police urgently hired a car to transport Dong to the Labor Hospital on Xikang Road, but she died on the way because her injuries were too severe. The police bureau has dispatched personnel to track down the fugitive perpetrator.</p>
<h3>Military Accident on Nanjing West Road; Two Pedestrians Suffer Broken Legs and Facial Injuries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Cheng (23 years old, from Henan), a driver of the 17th Motor Transport Regiment, was driving a giant truck of the regiment at around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, traveling east to west on Nanjing West Road when he reached the intersection of Xikang Road. In order to avoid other vehicles, he carelessly overturned Zhao Linggen (45 years old, local) and Wang Changmao (39 years old, from Zhejiang), who were riding bicycles. Zhao's legs were broken, and Wang's face was injured. The wall of the Hardoon Garden also collapsed. Afterwards, the nearby sentry police arrived and took the driver Zhang Cheng, who caused the accident, to the Jing'an Temple Branch Bureau. After interrogation, he was transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3>Football Game in the South City; Kyushu and Samsung Fail to Score</h3>
<p>Kyushu and Samsung played the main match of the Democratic Cup yesterday in the South City. More than 3,000 people came to visit the field, (2,065 tickets were actually sold) and the situation was extremely warm. Kyushu took the offensive as soon as the ball was kicked off. After holding on for 20 minutes, Samsung got four corner kicks, all of which were safely defused by Huang Shijie one by one. The first half ended with no gains for either side. After changing sides, the situation was still tense, only creating highlights for Huang Shijie and Liao Xiong. Until the end, there was no harvest, and the two sides shook hands and made peace.</p>

<h3>China Aviation Wins Narrowly Against Qunli; 4-3, a One-Goal Difference</h3>
<p>The A Division football league is nearing its end. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, China Aviation and Qunli met in Yiyuan. There were few spectators, only about one or two hundred. Both sides were unenthusiastic. China Aviation's strength has dissipated, and Qunli's host Pan Shijie has also gone to Hong Kong. In a fierce battle, China Aviation defeated Qunli by a one-goal difference of 4-3.</p>
<p>The whistle blew to start the match, and China Aviation's five forwards advanced. Gao Xiuqing forced a shot and scored first. Not long after, Qunli counterattacked, and Lin Shaojun took a corner kick, which was well-placed. Chen Longquan scored a low shot, tying the score. After fighting fiercely for 27 minutes, Shang Huajun intercepted the ball and passed it forward. Gao Xiuqing single-handedly raided the camp, and Xian Boming charged into the formation. Gao flipped the ball towards the empty goal, and Zhao Yongfang hooked it out with a big kick, defusing the danger. In an instant, Chen Longquan sang and acted by himself, scoring a goal, taking the lead 2-1. The first half ended soon after.</p>
<p>After a short break, the two armies engaged in battle. China Aviation remained in its original formation, while Qunli Yu Musen entered the lineup, replacing Lu Fangkui. China Aviation fought hard, Xu Zuguochuan passed the ball, Xian Boming pounced out, and Li Shunsheng pushed the ball into the goal near the door, tying the score again. After that, Zheng Simin hung a pass in front of the goal, and Xu Zuguochuan soared into the sky. China Aviation continued to work hard, and Li Shunsheng passed the ball to the middle, Gao Xiuqing single-handedly entered the door, taking the lead again 3-2. China Aviation's morale was boosted, and they were even more successful. Zheng Simin marched quickly, hooked the ball along the bottom line, and Xu Zuguochuan made a cut shot, making the score 4-2, giving them an overwhelming advantage. Qunli's anger soared, vowing to recover their lost ground. Lin Shaojun cut down a goal in the chaos. After that, although the two armies worked hard, they failed to achieve anything. Time ran out, and China Aviation won by a one-goal difference of 4-3.</p>

<h3>Exciting Games at the Gymnasium: Two Friendly Matches End in Draws</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were two exciting friendly basketball games at the gymnasium. Coinciding with the holiday, there were many fans. These games were also the first exciting matches after the gymnasium was lent to the hospital. The Green Forest team fought the Shanghai Police team to a draw. The Green Forest team played wonderfully, but unfortunately, their initial shots were not accurate enough to secure a victory. However, their ability to draw with the Shanghai Police team shows their fighting spirit. Ren Yu and Er Yu focused on team cooperation, but their shooting and free-throw percentages were lower than usual, which was a slight disappointment. Jiu Er made the most of his individual strengths and high-speed attacks, which were very effective. Both teams ended the game with a score of 43.</p>
<h3>Today's Grade A Table Tennis League: Postal Service B and Postal Affairs to Battle Huamei</h3>
<p>The previous match saw Quanlv defeat Postal Service B by three matches to two.</p>
<p>The fourth Table Tennis League has already entered its fifth week of competition today. Today (9th), starting from 5:30 PM, there will be two Grade A matches and four Grade B matches. In Grade A, Huamei will face both Postal Service B and the Postal Affairs team. Huamei has won all three of its matches and has a strong lineup. It still appears to be a strong contender for the championship this year. Except for the defending champion Jingwu team, the other teams are not their opponents. In this match against two strong teams, Huamei should be able to easily defeat Postal Service B in the first game. However, in the second game against Postal Affairs, they must field their best players. Most of the players on the Green Huamei team were players from the Shanghai Star team, the champion of the second league. Back then, they were careless and only six players attended, resulting in them losing three consecutive matches after winning the first three, and ultimately losing to Postal Affairs by a score of three to four. If they are still careless this time, they may be taught another lesson. Although Postal Affairs has lost twice, it was partly due to incomplete personnel and partly due to bad luck. This time, facing a strong team, they will definitely give it their all. It is not impossible for the old story to be repeated. The schedule for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Huamei vs. Postal Service B (Grade A) 5:30 PM Postal Affairs</p>
<p>Huamei vs. Postal Affairs (Grade A) 7:00 PM Postal Affairs</p>
<p>Dagong vs. Lulian (Grade B1) 7:00 PM Jinmen</p>
<p>Zhaoshang vs. Postal Service 18 (Grade B2) 7:00 PM Yousi</p>
<p>Lianqing vs. Xinyi (Grade B2) 7:00 PM Xinyi</p>
<p>Xinxing vs. Chouhong (Grade B3) 7:00 PM Chouye</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Quanlv played against Postal Service B at the Postal Affairs' gymnasium. The competition between the two sides was fierce. Unfortunately, in the second match, Zhu Qingji of Postal Service B committed two touch-the-table faults due to extreme tension, resulting in a two-point penalty. His psychology suddenly changed, and he was out of sorts, allowing Lu Yongkang of the opposing team to take the opportunity to attack fiercely, turning defeat into victory and winning by two matches to one, creating an absolute advantage. Postal Service B had a strong comeback, winning the fourth and fifth matches, but ultimately lost to Quanlv by a score of two to three.</p>
<p>(Quanlv) Score (Postal Service B)</p>
<p>Dai Xing 21-15 21-18 Dai Yongquan</p>
<p>Lu Yongkang 21-13 12-21 22-20 Zhu Qingji</p>
<p>Ma Gengyao 21-16 21-19 Zhu Zhongsun</p>
<p>Fan Liangji 22-21 14-21 16-21 Yu Chunrong</p>
<p>Wang Yishan 22-20 15-21 13-21 Zhu Jinhai</p>
<p>Grade B Results</p>
<p>Tianxiang defeated Tiema (Grade B2) 4-1</p>
<p>Zhaoshang defeated Zhongnong (Grade B2) 4-1</p>
<p>Postal Service 18 defeated Xinghuo (Grade B2) 3-2</p>
<p>Lingyun defeated Yousi (Grade B1) 4-1</p>
<p>Yucai defeated Postal Service 3 (Grade B3) 4-1</p>
<p>Haiguang defeated Zhongji (Grade B1) 5-0</p>
<p>Haiguang defeated Zhongji</p>
<p>In the match between Haiguang and Zhongji, the latter's skills were also quite good, but after Haiguang unfortunately lost to Shanbao by two matches to three, they practiced diligently under the encouragement of Wang Zongzao and Li Peide, making rapid progress. In a one-sided situation, they won all five matches by two games to zero, which is commendable. Currently, there are no undefeated teams in Grade B1, and four teams have only lost once. Haiguang is one of the four teams, and their future is promising.</p>
<p>(Haiguang) Score (Zhongji)</p>
<p>Sun Zhaohong 21-14 21-13 Hong Chaoqun</p>
<p>Yang Yongkang 21-18 21-19 Xu Yonghai</p>
<p>Lu Jixing 21-8 21-11 Shen Baosheng</p>
<p>Yu Qingwu 21-15 21-11 Shi Genfu</p>
<p>Ling Kecheng 21-14 21-14 Wang Tingsun</p>
<h3>Short-Distance Prodigy Paden Sets Two World Records in a Row</h3>
<p>[United Press Los Angeles, 7th] South California University short-distance prodigy, Paden, set two world records in a row at this track and field meet today. Paden's 220-yard dash time was 20.21 seconds, and his 100-yard dash time was 9.1 seconds. The International Amateur Athletic Federation just recognized Paden's 9.3-second 100-yard world record yesterday. However, today's new 100-yard record may not be included in the world record due to the favorable wind. The new 220-yard record will be included in the official record.</p>

<h3>Establishing Civilian Medical Relief Institutions: Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross Seeks Housing</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In view of the needs of the times, our association plans to establish civilian medical relief institutions to provide universal services to all sectors of society. We have made considerable preparations for all medical supplies, personnel, and other items; however, we still lack suitable housing for use, which makes it impossible to start work.

There is no shortage of enthusiastic public-spirited people in Shanghai. At this time, we hope to cooperate with them. We have always appreciated your newspaper's support, and we hope that you will publish this letter to broaden the scope of our request. We would be extremely grateful! Sincerely,</p>
