<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕致院廿四日已推定和平代表，並促中共卽派代表開始和談。政府代表五人中，邵力子·張治中·李蒸三氏均在京，黃紹竑卽可自港飛京，章士劍亦已定廿四日夜車來京。後等將在李代總統及何院長會同之研討下，預擬和談之根據與步驟，並蒐集各項資料，準備開始和談。政院發言人于會議未散前，首先向記者宣佈：「政府深感早日實現和平為全國人民最迫切之要求，因此，何院長於本日視事之始，卽召開院會，討論有關促進和平各項問題，經決議派邵力子·張治中·黃紹竑·章士劍·李蒸五先生為政府和談代表，希望中共方面亦迅速派定代表，並就舉行和談之地點，及開始和談之日期，提出意見，以利和談進行，並慰全國人民之渴望」。</p>
<p>邵力子　張治中　黃紹竑　章士釗　李蒸</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府和談代表經政務會議通過後，廿五日晨九時將在京舉行一重要會商，討論和談之和序問題。留滬之章士劍氏，昨接獲何院長通知，當夜晉京與會。會畢仍將返滬，俟代表團行期決定，再赴指定地點會齊啓行。章氏離滬前表示：此次何院長邀請黨外人士担任和談代表，具見國民黨之雅量，深可欽佩。深信以此種公平態度求取和平，成功之希望甚大。本人願藉此良機，為全民服務，於國共代表之間，盡疏導排解之責，使和議有成。和談之地點，迄未決定，前在平瀲中商時，中共代表提及北平·島·石家莊三處。政府和談代表集中南京後，將就和談之地點及程序與平方洽商，再作決定，預計十日內可望成行。記者詢以此次和談中第三方面人士是否參加？章氏稱：此為國共間之直接洽商，其他黨派及民意代表不致參加，和平如能實現，可能重開包括其他派之政治協商。章氏強調此次和談雙方均有誠意，中共在江北雖有軍事行動，但亦屬備戰求和之性質，與江南無殊，而在和談進行期內，個人之看法，認為共軍不致渡江，因如有此舉，影響中共之信用太大也。關於吳副長鐵城在穗透露之中共要求內容，章氏不作負責之證實，但謂提是提到，但相當籠統。</p>

<h3 id="c21">社論　工業界的呼聲 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>本市工業會於二十三日電呈何院長，痛陳工業界的危機，並對於政府當前之工彙措施，提了四項建議。：（一）恢復僑匯與外匯移轉證的分別掛牌辦法，並維持輸了入聯鎖制；（二）充法抑平高利貸；（三）取銷貨物稅征實辦扶；　對於輸出入品應嚴加限制。當此全國工業生產陷於停頓狀態之際，政府當局早就應該設法補救，使其從呆滯的狀態中逐漸活潑起來，現在旣由本市工業會提出四項建議，政府當局自應格外重視，立即採行。姑將經濟學的原則原理，置而不輪，即以現實而言，這四項建議不僅是全國工業生產的命脈所擊，也是挽救全國經濟危機的關鍵所在。</p>
<p>這種生產事業所遭遇的危機，不獨政府轄區如此，中共區域亦同樣感到，中共在石家莊舉行七屆　中全會結束時，發出對中共黨員的警告，說中共的中心工作由鄉村發展到城市，如果不能使城市的生產工作得到恢復和發展，那麼共黨就會站不住腳百宜告失敗。即此，更可瞪明城市生產工作之重要。假使我們的政府所規劃的財經政策，不顧到工業界迫切的呼籲而使生產受到打擊，則政府亦必然要遇到失敗的命運。今天政府就該努力和中共作一番扶助工業生產的競賽。</p>
<p>我們研究今日一般工業生產陷於呆滯狀態的原因，除了政局動　不定的大環境而外，尚有下列幾項因素：</p>
<p>第一是生產成本太大。因為我國工業所需的原料，大半仰給外國，而最近外匯移轉瞪的價格猛漲不已，使生產成本也隨之增加。凡是注意商情的人，無不知道外匯證價格上漲的情形。去年十二月＋二日外楓瞪每－美元合金圓券廿五元，至今年－月廿六日升匯一百七十元，在七＋天內漲起七倍，漲勢尚屬和緩；但至三月＋六日却漲至六千八百七十五元，於五＋天內漲起四＋倍。這種漲風如火如荼，實在太驚人了！而且從三月＋六日起，漲風並未停止，＋七日的價格是七千四百二＋五元，＋八日是八千五百元，＋九日是八千六百七＋五元，廿－日是九千八百三十五元，廿二日是－萬零二百五十元，廿三日是－萬零七百元，咋日竟漲至一萬－千五百元。從這幾個統計數字裹可以看出，外匯證的價格上漲，較任何物價為快，確有領導物價上漲的蓄意?換句話說，就是原料漲得快，遠在製成品之上，照常是說，本有所謂「水漲船高」的話，工為生產是不怕原料上漲的；但在今日，因為客觀環境的特殊，如銷區縮小，購買力減低等等，永漲了船却並未能升高，試想這種賠本生意，誰願意去做？因此，已開辦的工廠，為了少賠本起見，不得不減工或停上生產，新辦而尚未開工的工廠，更要中途停止進行，暫抱觀望態度了。</p>
<p>第二是製成品的實銷淸淡。在目前的環境之下，除了食·衣·住·行日常持活所必需的用品而外，其他一切裂成品的實銷，都非常清淡?一則由於金圓券的膨脹過速，使－般人的購貿力劇降至極小的限度，除了日常生活的必需品不得不買而外，對於其他製成品，都是無錢購買的了。再則由於時局的和戰未定，即使有錢購得起貨物，也望商品而止步，加以「賭風」市楊由當局倡導，大家改向金融性的商品進攻，金·銀·外幣，都成了有購買能力奢搶購的對象。因此，金融性的商品每天都在漲，此外惟食糧也跟着漲，其他－般商品却不能亦步亦趨，落在後面，否則就乏人問章。誠然，在通貨膨脹的時期，襲成品實銷淸淡，本不足以虐殺工商，甚至反有利於工商，但在今日高利代的情況之下，却完全不問了。行莊放款的官息每大六＋元，增市利息有時逾每天百元者，故以每日複利計，貸款一元，每日利息六分，－個月的本息台計釣為六倍，倘長此不變，全年十二個月竟可達二＋－億餘倍之鉅！如此情形，足使工廠進退兩難，如果要計算成本，不肯廉價傾銷，借債度日，則將不勝高利貸的負担，反之，如果忍痛貶價斬售，則其所得，又決不足以再生產。我們從前說過，一二月以的，上海州有的工廠＋之八九恐怕都要宜告「關門大吉」，現在看來，或竟等候不到一二月以後了吧！</p>
<p>要之，上海市工業會向政府提了建議，都是政府挽救工商業危機的當務之亟，尤其對於今日工業陷於「求生不能求死不得」的困境之下的情形，更不能等閑視之。工業是國家生存的命脈，工業破產了，還講什磨國計民生！我們念切地盼望何內閣體察民意，從速決定挽救工業之對策。</p>

<p>〔美國新開處本市訊〕美國駐滬總領事葛柏德廿四日晚宣稱：美國對華政策之「最高目標」，必須為「保持我兩國人民歷史性之友誼」。</p>
<p>葛柏德係在武裝部隊靑年會中發表演說。</p>
<p>渠稱：「吾人對於解決此一問題（卽美國對舉政策）所有無限價值之資產為中國人民對吾人之友誼與信任．吾人擁有此種資產，乃因中國人民一世紀以來深知吾人之行動，已顯示吾人為誠實而比較無利害關係之友人，在目前此種局勢中，吾人應協助中國人擬成其自己解決之辦法，但切勿以吾人之辦法強施於中國，以致擲去此種資產。</p>
<p>葛柏德斷然駁斥共黨所指在華「美帝國主義」之罪名，認為此種指摘「不合理與前後矛盾」渠指出：共黨之慣技往往卽以「其本人所做之事，指摘他人」。關於比點，渠引澄蘇聯在中國所造成帝國生義之紀錄。</p>
<p>葛氏稱：「吾人屢圖協助中國，但若干中國人士竟以為吾人意國剝削並統治彼綜，此誠大惑不解者。蘇聯曾有一長串之帝國主義之紀錄，先後掠奪唐努吐瓦，外蒙古及旅順，佔據大連，獲得在滿洲內之甚多特權，目前並圖在新疆取得特殊地位，然彼等竟認為蘇聯為渠等之至友，是亦令人費解」。</p>
<p>葛氏對中共指責國民黨領袖完全聽命於美國一節加以答復。據謂；「由於過去其他國家之驕矜，中國人民乃發生一種敏感心理，此種心理固在情理之中」，但鑒於此點，美國對其他友國所毫無躊躇提出之意見，乃未敢向中國提出。「中國政府常依據其獨立主權，拒絕吾人之要求一節，亦屬事實。如彼等時常未能採擇吾人基於友誼之建議，例如吾人建議彼等卽使在戰時亦可對聯合國憲章所揭豬木之　自由，予以更大之尊重，但此一意見卽未曾建議彼等卽使在戰時亦可對聯合國憲章所揭豬木之　自由，予以更大之尊重，但此一意見卽未蒙採納。</p>
<p>共黨認為美國對筆援助之目的，在擴張美國之經濟利益，葛柏德對於此點亦如駁斥。葛氏稱：吾人在中國有一億二千萬元之投資，其中之四千六百萬元乃投資於醫院，大學及類似之非營利團體，共黨是否認為吾人在一年中支出援款四億元卽所以保護此項投資」？</p>
<p>「事實上吾人協助中國抵禦外來專制之肆脅，當然並不計及吾人方在之經濟利益。吾人不欲剝削中國，吾人即使欲剝削中國，亦不能行之。」</p>
<p>葛氏力言中國人可以解決中國問題，並謂「獨裁主義之精義——不論其為共產主義或其他形式——為暴力，百民主政治之精義則勸導」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據中共電台石家莊廿四日消息稱：中國共產黨第七屆第二次中央委員會全體會議在石家莊附近舉行，會期先後八日，業已圓滿給束。出席共黨中委卅四人，候補中委十九人，缺席者廿人，大會由毛澤東主席，並向全會報告工作。大會批准該黨－九四五年六月一中全會以來中央政治局工作報告，並批准各民主黨派，人民團體及民主人士召開新的政治協商會議以成立民主聯合政府的建議。全會又追認毛澤東一月十四日聲明及其所提八項和平條件，與南京國民政府及其他任何地方政府與軍事集團舉行和平談判的基礎。此次中共七屆二中全會之議題中心，着重於當前形勢下，共黨由鄕村移至城市的工作重心問題。該黨指出自一九二七年以還，其革命鬥爭重點在鄉村，在鄕村舉集力量，用鄉村包圍城市，然後奪取城市；惟時至今日，共產黨之任務，已重新開始了由城市到鄉村，由城市領導鄉村的時期。共黨的決策，認為現今城市與鄉村必須緊密聯繫，決不可丟掉鄉村而僅顧城市，認今後共黨必須建築於城市之上。中共指出今後該黨之工作必須用極大的努力去壓會領導城市人民進行其鬥爭，同時並應學習管理城市與建設城市的方法。該黨認為欲領導城市人民鬥爭，須依靠工人階級，團結其他勞動羣衆，爭取知識份子，爭取能夠與共黨合作的小資產階級，自由資產階級及其代表人物，站在一條戰綫上，向席國主義，國民黨以及官僚資產階級從事堅快鬥爭。該黨又認為管理與建設城市之中心關鍵乃在恢復並發展工業生產，包括公營，私營及手工業生產。此外並應注意共產黨的組織工作，政權要關的建設工作，工會工作與各種民衆團體的組訓工作，治安工作，文化敎育工作導，而以恢復並發展工業生產為其中心工作。該會又號召其黨員應竭盡全力學習工業生產之技術及管理方法及與生產有密切聯繫的商業工作。該黨宣言中並明確警告其黨中，謂共產黨如在生產工作上不能太得迅速發展，不能恢復及獲得成績，首先使工人生活有所改善，共產黨興全國人民即不能維特其共產政權，而遭覆滅無疑。該黨在宜言中迫切要求工濃附級友知識份子，作為這個專政的領導力量及基礎力量，同時並要求與小資產階級及自由資產階級的代表人物共同合作，來推翻國民黨及帝國主義勢力，使中國由農業國轉變為工業國，由新民主主義國家轉變為社會主義國家。</p>

<h3 id="c68">本報提供碎屍案重要綫索　發現女襖袖裏紙條來歷　警局揣測案情含有桃色成份 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自謹記路碎屍案發生從，因案情曲折離奇，各方人士均深予注視。本報為求報導該案正確消息，亦動員採訪室全體人員。協助警寮當局尋覓綫索。昨深夜本報記者在一極偶然之機會下。發現壁上日曆中有績條格言「人之有仇與我，可忘而不可念」一句，其語句，字體，排列，順序，字條長度，竟與該案包裹墊屍女襖袖內所藏之一鉛印字條完全相同。該日曆為海寗路九九七弄華新日曆廠今年出品，在全年三百餘頁中，僅二月十一日及十月廿一日刋有上項格言，其字句之位置，係在日期之下，由右向左排列，以六號鉛字印成，日曆紙質為白報紙，長度約一寸半左右。本報記者發現此奧秘後，於今晨二時卽以電話就詢常熟路警分局長程義寬，程氏於聆得後至為驚訝，渠認為此種發現，對偵查工作將有莫大帮助，渠並肯定該案包裹內之紙條，確卽係自此種日曆上裁下者，因此紙條除上半頁之日期等全部被裁去外，其他一切完全相同。程氏表示：「此句格言旣係刊載於二月十一日日曆之上，則可能凶手於是日目觀此格言後，必感與其殺人動機隱合符節，因而保留，自該日起即具體考慮謀殺及移屍之方法，嗣後乃決定實施」。據記者觀察：由二月十一日起至三月廿一日止，當完全包　凶手起意，動手，以迄滅跡之過程。</p>
<h3 id="c69">四次検騐黃毛轉黑　斷定死者確係國人 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕謹記路無頭碎屍案，昨又有一「翻案」發現，卽根據死者屍體上第四次詳細檢驗結果，證明被害人並非外僑，而確係國人。</p>
<p>前日第三次檢驗時，認定屍身毛色之略帶黃白，昨經發覺，係受防腐藥劑搽抹所致，因此項毛色現已在逐漸轉黑。更兼屍身全部毛管細膩均勻，胸部奶頭並不粗大，雖肌肉堅實與足部較闊，但國人中亦不乏有體格頗好者，故法醫昨在拼湊屍塊詳加騐查後，對死者已肯定其決非外僑。</p>
<p>至於死者因何被殺？在何地被殺？負實偵查該案之警員認為：因屍身被支解處異常整潔，且毫無血跡，可證凶手處理該屍至少費有七入小時以上之時閒，如此長時問內進行此種工作，必係在室內無疑。再根據包裹屍身之女　及小兒開襠褲等視察，此一室內必有婦女居住。該案發生後並未見有任何家屬或婦女出面報告或有同時被害之跡象，則此婦女必與凶手有同謀嫌疑。無論此婦女與死者關係較深或與凶手關係較密，總之此案內含一段桃色糾紛，凶手由情妬而出此，當屬極有可能。但殺害地點究在本市抑在外埠，迄尚無法加以確定。</p>
<p>謹記路工人　曾見携包客</p>
<p>此外承辦警員昨績又發現一新綫索：據齊魯別　（該案之碎最初發現處卽在別　後門）門房「老王」稱，十九日黃昏後，謹記路修路工人，曾見有一三輪車載客在別歇旁下車，拿包裹　匆循土路（見附圖）向　地走去，嗣後情形則未注意。按十九日至廿一日均陰雨，該案發現在廿一日清晨，因包屍糊索尚未全濕，故斷定凶手棄屍工作係於當日黎明前所做。則此十九日　包裹之客是否與該案有關？現警局亦已進行偵查。</p>
<p>兇手市區來　取道謹記路</p>
<p>依照警局目前推斷，該案由殺害起以移屍，至少曾有二人以上參與其事。發現秦屍處之原來形狀，係包裹半倚於齊魯別　後門上，另一旅行包則秦置於小浜中。此點警局指為係二人同時參與佈置之跡象。且鄰近該地附郊，大半幾均為荒地，田野，或塚地，兇手常時專擇別馱後之隱蔽地棄屍，足設其對該地情形早已然悉。再就交通方面言，能華機場檢查頗嚴，兇手由航空携屍來滬之機會極少，果兇手係自滬杭綫新能華站下車，則為避免注意，可隨處將包裹拋棄，不必特來別馱附近。空陸二路俱無較大可能，故警局斷定兇手係來自市區，而其取道必為謹記路。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市工業會昨日下午三時，召集有關各業討論汽柴油分配間題，輸管會副主委李　某及該會汽柴油分配組組長董定鳳繚均到會列席。首由李副主委報告辦理分配原則及經過情形，繼由各業代表發表意見，歸納之約可得四點：（一）各廠汽柴油分酊額配定後，得在規定時問內分期出油，分期付款，以誠少各工廠經濟負担。（二）市上黑市油日多，而輸管會對各業汽柴抽分配量極少，請該管當局查明黑市油來源及配油減少之原因。（三）請求政府取消汽柴油進口限額，以裕油源，而平油價。（四）過去一部份工廠燃料採用煤斤，目前煤荒嚴重，不得不改用柴油，此種工廠應給于申請配油機會。結果率副生委對第一點分期出油分期付款已表同意外，其餘允轉輸管會及主瞥當局參考。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕理髮：沐浴價格基數，前經該兩業公會擬訂呈送社會局審核後，社會局定今日上午召集該兩業公會代表會商決定，以便送請市府核准公布。昨據社局負責人稱：刻正審核該兩業戰前之賬簿，以與目前之價目對照，務尋求一比較合理之基數。此兩業中，理髮業較浴室業之問題易於解決。此兩業之共通困難問題，卽為生活指數每月發表兩次，價目亦調整兩次，然物價則無日無時不在波動。在生活指數發表後一二日內，價目驟然增高，營業必然淸淡，在生活指數發表前一二日內，因與其他物價此較低秉，則顧客必又擁擠不堪。該兩業不希望有此現象，最好能逐步上漲，使每日營業保特一定水準。聞公用事業有一假定指數，依此假定指數逐步調整，談兩業亦希望定一公式，將各項成本計算在內，依此公式逐步調整，與物價之上漲率保特均衡，不致距離太遠。社局對談項辦法正在考慮中，今日會議中將獲決定。</p>

<h3 id="c96">浙江農民學校展望 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 本報時派員儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿二日訊〕在舉國增產盤中，浙江省的農民學校，經過了四個多月的籌備，在杭郊松木場開始了師資訓練。這是前浙江省主席陳公洽氏的兩大農業政策。土地改革與農民學校的一部份。晨民學校是在卅七年八月十九日浙省府委會第一五七〇次會議席上通過的；設立了籌備委員會，聘任浙省建設廳長，敎育廳長，農改所長，浙大農學院長，英大農學院長，金陵大學農學院長，浙省鄉湖師範學校校長，杭市政府園林管理處長，浙省府農民問題顧問二人並省府委員兼浙省墾務委會主任委員節為籌備委員，在籌備會中，設幹事五人，辦事員三人，承辦日常事務。經過了章早的草擬與師資訓練場合的確定，各縣農校校址的勘定，同時招考師資訓練，該班就在三十八年一月起開始講習。</p>
<p>授農民以實惠民</p>
<p>依浙江的地理形勢講，所謂富庶乏區係僅指地面的生產而言，因為浙境礦藏貧乏，煤鐵缺少，所以將來的前途也要看地面生產的改良如何而定?今天農村中耕力離散，農具陳舊，農屋傾圯，農民生活不堪問聞，如何來談堵加生產？如何來談生產改良？所謂給予濃民實惠的農村敎育，合作農貸等，也僅是隔靴搔癢，摸不着癢處。因為授與農民實惠的人根本與農民脫了節，不諳他們的需要，更不懂他們的心情，不能和他們生活在一起，了解他們的痛苦。</p>
<p>師資甲乙兩系</p>
<p>浙江省的農民學校，是針對這個前題而創設的。他的師資分甲乙兩系，甲系為專門農業為主，乙系為語文常識為主，甲系要大學農學院畢業，從事農業工作有一年以上者或是高級農業職業學校畢茉，從事農業工作三年以上者。乙系要師範或高中以上學校畢業，從事農業或社政文敎工作。有三年以上服務者，他們招老了甲系六十人，乙系四十人，上午上學科，下午大家赤腳下田操作，精習各種增產的新技衛，如耕作灌漑，施肥，使用機器等新式方法。同時研習去種循着現實濃村環境而改造的方法，如衛生，治病，敎育子女，起居飲食，待人接物等。師資訓練六個月後就算畢業，分發各縣農民學校為校長或教師，這許多師資到農民學校去以後，要實際從事操作，與農民學校的農民共同操作，在做中讓農民學，學中去敎農民，這當然司以比較知道他們的需要，心情，同時和他們生活在一起，也可以了解他們的痛苦，進而為之解決了。</p>
<p>農民受訓條件</p>
<p>農民學校本身受訓的農民，是不拘費格的，只要有實際耕作的經驗，身體強健，品性端正而略識文字，年齡在二十歲到三十五歲者，每校以六十人為主，他們在受訓期內，除膳宿作業各費一律由校供給外，每名並就農場共伺勞作收穫總額內分配三畝至五畝的收獲量，以資津貼，他們每名操作，也是分配三畝至五畝的耕熟田地，合作利用，他們是以操作為課程，田地為教室，校舍宿舍都要利用公共房屋，或改良原有的農舍，如須另建，亦要和普通農舍相仿，而加以改進，以為新農村建設的示範，校址必須擇交通便利，地址適中者，他們畢業以後，就回到自已的家園，他們在農村社會中就成了改進農村的核心，政府以後合作發貸與一切給予實惠農村的地方，都經過農民學校畢業的農民之手，再貸與廣大的農村。政府有所法令，也可由畢業後的農民傳授給廣大的農民，他們將受訓的心得，也教給其他的農民，如此，則浙江的農符，當可改觀了。我們自很佩服這佣遠見的。</p>
<p>師訓班的學員</p>
<p>記者農前受日民學校師資訓練誑之邀，對全體受訓的學員作特約演講，得着這一機會，便順便參觀了師訓班的一切師訓班學員一百人，個個都是年靑力壯，穿着發下來的絳靑色的棉襖褲，每個人都迅速地在整理他們的功課，在講堂上，都勤懇的作着筆記，下午大家胼手胝足的耕耘田地，我曾訪問過幾位學員，他們都以改造農村為職志，他們認今日中國的農地，還未「充分就業」，所以用新的技術新的機械去耕耘，可以獲得大量的生產，生產增加，農民的生活也可改善。他們並不想發財，也不想做官，他們願以復興中國農村事業為終身事業。</p>
<p>新機械新技術</p>
<p>我曾參觀他們的機械，有曳引機好幾架，打穀機一架，耙與鋤犁，鏟很多，據班主任局進三氏告訴我：「中央病虫害研究委負會願與師訓班合作，常駐在班中，又獸醫學校中的家畜系，也願與師訓班合作，駐在班中。所以師訓班前途是很光明的」。問氏是台灣農業中心台中的農學院院長，他對農民學校抱着無限的希望。我們兩人曾瞻望浙省甚至全國農業的美麗遠景，農村有了組織，新的機械新的技術每個農人都會利用，曳引要每個農民也會行施，在幾個農村之間有了要械的修現廠，機械的加油站。農舍也已改良，農民生活很舒適，一切新中國的工業都配合着最大多數的農民生活與農業生產而發展，而在農村中矗立清一個個的烟囪。</p>
<p>入學年齡問題</p>
<p>記者從農校師訓班歸來，深覺這種農民壓校農民的入學年齡還可以降低到廿歲以下，因為提倡到今天的農村國民學校，刻板的上課，與城市中一樣的書本，已使農民對之亳不感到興趣。所以記者走過不少的中國各省農村，保國民學校僅掛一槐空招牌，雙扉緊掩，紘歌始終是不能運續的，如果我們以浙江省這種農民農校的方法來敎育廿歲以下的農民，那麼農民一定會表示熟烈擁護的。由此，我們想到農民學校不妨分成數級，假定初級班為十歲以下的農民求學，中級班為十二歲以上的農民求學，高級班為二十歲以上三十五歲以下的農民求學，高級班可卽為現在之師訓班，中級班的師資即為高級班的畢業生，初級班的師資即為中級班的畢業生，在初級班中，只要加入國民學校的一般敎材內容，仍舊注重生產，實踐，很據敎育上最高的原則「做，學，敎」，這樣下去，即知即傳，非但農村可迅獲復蘇，而且農民的受益也不少了。</p>
<p>歸入敎育系統</p>
<p>不久以前，浙江省參議會一屆五次大會的召開，適是陳公洽離浙，周奉璋繼之主浙之時，省參會的討論會中，以為農民學校糜費公帑過鉅，故議決請省府撤銷，惟據記者所知，局主席現正躊躇着，因參議會代表民意主張撇銷，而前主席辦此學校，自也有一番苦心。日前敎廳長李季谷氏對敎廳同人訓話，大意說農民學校還是要辦，不過減少幾班。因原規定本年下期起即先選定三十縣，各設一校。道樣看來，農民學校當仍要辦的。這當然周主席也看到了今天農村的實際情形所致。記者覺得如果採納我上面這一們意見，把農民學校明顯的歸入敎育系統，而把有名無實在農村中的國民學校取銷，改辦農民學校，豈不更好？</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕黃金昨日市勢，晨開因攝於在行拋壓，場內交易形成僵持，各經紀人於九時三十分開市後一片空喊，未曾交易，緣隔夜行局鉅額差出，昨日銀根走勢鬆濫，因之人心向昂，吸意濃郁，故做價不易喊開。嗣後大德成先以五九五萬賣出，交易始行做開。惟大德成係代央行拋售，喊價一出，人心即歡，場上脫售慚衆，於是做價回落至五九〇萬邊。但挫跌有日，多頭負息過甚，更因銀根尚鬆，暗息亦廉，執戶不願在壓力控制下賤價斬殺，瞬間納胃又盛，喊價重復回升至五九五萬買進，但賣出仍少。</p>
<p>嗣後央行以五九五萬無限拋售，人心始穩，而隔夜浮多逢高吐售，行情略見回低，做價為五九三萬。嗣後場外走勢高俏，人心又復趨堅，喊五九四萬有進，盤旋甚久，最後浮散戶鑒於漲勢有限，好面不多，了售頻繁，市祝稍疲，而以五九三萬午收。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕央行為平抑物價，昨日起分在黃金棉紗等市場大量拋售物資，黃金市場上午批售一萬二千七百兩，收回通貨七十五億五千六百五十萬元，又棉紗市場由紡建公司代拋，計二〇支竇船紗三二四件，每件－八八萬。二〇又神虎二一二件，每件一八四萬，總共收回通貨十億另七千餘萬元。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕黃金昨日下午市勢走勢仍軟，因央行在前市大量拋售，各帮納胃已呈飽和，而在前市購進之執戶，頭寸已感緊急，下午急於張羅，部份執戶則又紛紛軋單，市呈供多求少，晚收再告回落。初開五八七萬，一度高至五八八萬，多頭拉高後再起吐售，卽挫至五八〇萬。嗣後散戶吸納，市勢低後回升，晚收為五八六萬，以上成交均為當天頭寸，隔日交割則須另行加息云。</p>

<p>香港開放金禁說　恐有搶購的傾向</p>
<p>香港方面，過去答允中國政府的要求，禁止黃金進口。雖只是公式化的禁止，實際上，大陸上流去的仍不在少數。不過流入時，都是走私，而不無小費浪費</p>
<p>港方這項答允，是表示協助中國穩定幣值的。</p>
<p>這個紳士協定，聽說現在港方當局的重新考慮中。本來是禁止自由進口的，那末現在之重新考慮，當然是考慮恢復自由進口了。</p>
<p>這個消息，昨天起，已經反映到香港金市場上。</p>
<p>本週以來，港地金價，原自三〇四元，直跳出三一四元以上，一度高達三一六元，因為道一消息的傳出，港地金價，就急速降至三一〇元邊上。</p>
<p>我們別看輕港方的這一消息，要是不確，果然一切不變。要是確的，動機當然在吸取大陸上的黃金了。</p>
<p>於是，大陸與港地的爭取黃金，金價前途，更有看好的理由。</p>
<p>從最近英鎊有貶值訊，港幣有發行過分膨眼，而遭紳士們攻擊的許多新事件來看，港地恢復黃金自由淮口的消息，可能性是很多的。</p>
<p>在大環境方面，正臨風兩滿樓的關頭。</p>
<p>股市一蹶不振，表示着許多最基本的暗流。司以指出的：本來規規矩矩當做投資的人，都在趁高甩出。甚至老根上的貨色，也在局部的甩出。貼息這麼高，散戶當然都樂得抱長空萬利的方針。聽說：亭鼠們雖然多數是多頸，但如此高利息之下，能夠拼得住。眞把亨鼠們看成便大頭了。</p>
<p>至於一般商品市場，已有逐漸向高處看齊的趨勢。不論對大局是樂興或悲觀，凡有外匯關係又有必城進口性質的，似乎希望最好。沒有實銷，是暫時局面。一旦局面改觀，則就唯恐貨少了。</p>
<p>據各業中人分析：就商品範圍內劃算，化工原料及生要西藥，凡國內無法替代的，背着長　無妨。譬如凡士林，石炭酸等，國內絕無可以替代，所以要從無可替代，而又用途廣泛的範圍內去掘寶的。至於成藥，他們以為：（一）國外的發明，日新月異，（二）國慘內也儘可能想仿製；所以，牌子好的也不壞。</p>
<p>紙張，原是好東西。但近來歐美正在貶價傾銷，而且運港數量甚鉅，一時沒有多大苗頭。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨晚甲一組兩場，回力勝滬警四十八比三十，培斐爾勝恩卡斯四十比卅九。第一循環勝的，都變了負的。甲二B無名勝合衆卅六比三十二，觀衆二千左右，與高采烈。</p>
<p>回力最近數戰，殊見長足進步，籃下球控制得法，投籃亦異常順手，昨晚演出，愈使觀衆滿意。田福海的投籃，魏戍的籃下坐鎭，都相當引人入勝。滬警上半時已像吃着辣手，下半時更無能為力矣。</p>
<p>和對滬警，回力五人為魏戌·田福海·葉云山·王永芳·曹志吉，對手以史久全·王蓉生·何增·王伯文·傳其俠五個靑年軍應戰。開賽後何增邊陲建殊勳，回力魏戌報以一球，九比四，回力聲勢大盛，三比二領前。老曹與田王三人，各中一球，九比四，回力聲勢大盛。滬警永標　久全，依然四面楚歌。回力連鄰帶罰，俄頃更增至十四分，對方還祇四分，對方還祇四分。伯文有神射之名，也在那裡零碎動。十八比士後，滬警永標其俠找着了幾個空擋，稍為打一些氣。不過向力田魏等俯拾卽是，上半時廿六比十七，滬警為之氣沮。</p>
<p>滬警下半時陣綫為伯文·久全·何增·永標·金貴·回力原封不動，伯文開下半時紀錄，田福海「福如東海」單手轉進去，再加上一只罰球，平添生分，回力有「紅得發紫」的形勢。曹志吉運翻帶滾，又見得意傑作，滬警似成強弩之末，四十比廿二時，相差已十八分。不料金貴的連中三元，伯文的添色，一氣呵成八分，希望未絕。然奈尚餘短短的五分鐘，蓉生五次犯規，梁代戰，主將一走，滬警愈慘，四十八比三十，回力報復第一媚環敗辱之仇。</p>

<p>甲二B無名勝合衆，結果卅六比卅二，無名之嚴雙陵，合衆之熊元忠，均出人頭地。合衆中第一球，以後無名連獲十一分，不久又成廿一比六，上半時廿二比十四。下半時合衆李振邦熊元忠等悉力反攻，面目全非，曾成卅比廿八，僅一球落後，無名鍾信順最後努力，卒以卅六比卅二小勝。</p>
<h3 id="c120">恩卡斯一分叫屈　培斐爾喜出望外 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>甲一第一場恩卡斯再戰培斐爾，上場時候培斐爾克勒與派克司兩人各中一球，恩卡斯泊透中籃，曾連得九分，丙軍遂彼此上下不定，上半時培斐爾廿三比廿一，春風滿面，小勝二分。下半時不久又成廿六平手，恩隊凱捷密洛夫蓄奧柴遼出，比數復告撲朔迷離，同時大家釘得很緊。恩卡斯的客將泊透（原隸氣象隊）表演殊佳，單手投籃，姿勢自然，最後一瞬間，恩卡斯尚領前一分，不料培斐爾專球殺入，格萊奇一篁球，四十比卅九，使恩卡斯叫屈不止。第一循環恩卡斯以四十二比廿六大勝，昨晚的結果竟了人意外。</p>

<p>跳槽的故事，在世界各地的球壇裡，那總是少不免的怪現象。可是，其間最使球迷感驚訝的，那自是要算發源地的英國。由於當地足球聯賽條俐規定：每年在斤三十六日以後，所有各隊球員登記效力，須受嚴厲的限制。簡單地說：總會接納與否？一槪須由總會予以決定。為了這原故，在每屆足球季節開始前，尤以三月十六日以前的一週，球壇裡就無形中變了驚人的市場，跳槽活動萬人注目。就目前觀察：本季醞釀的巨浪，要算足球史裏罕有的紀錄。究竟最後一日（五一日）的代價數字幾許？那是在誰也不能預言；但據權威界的觀察，最高的教字，可能超過原有紀錄數千鎊，那是無可否認的。根據起落無常的情形觀察︰就本季開始拉人迄今，跳糟已達三十宗，其代價已達五個數字（按：卽萬位字（。其中已被認創世界紀錄的，要算「德比省」隊以二萬四千鎊的代價，向「曼撤斯特聯隊」購得一尊尼摩利士」一宗。此外，超出二萬鎊的，有「愛迪基路疏」之由「比利隊」跳過「些路菲特隊」；和「佐治羅保度」之由「賓士利隊」跳「紐萬紫隘隊」兩宗。</p>
<p>除了上述前鋒跳槽代價不弱者還有多名，他們的代價約在一萬八千鎊之譜。姓名如下：</p>
<p>（一）「安地常奴臣」由「紐嘉麥聯隊」跳過「夫度布綠」，（二）「安地當奴臣」由「紐嘉麥聯隊」跳過「辛特蘭隊」，（鹼）「尊尼度利」由白籃福特隊」跳過「曼撤斯特聯隊」·此外，中衛跳精代價最主的也達一萬七千五百鎊，跳槽者是威爾殊國際選手「愛華保華路」，他由Queen's　Pkar　Ranger跳過「亞斯屯威尋那」；其次的，要算「白蘭福特隊」的隊長和正中衛「積芝斯摩斯」，他為了一萬六千鎊的代價跳過「些略菲特聯隊」；再次的是「北明罕隊」的「法籃米開曹」，北明罕為了一萬五千鎊的代價，就把傳的中衛　了給「東利士隊」。</p>
<p>說到後衛跳槽的事，代價也頗驚人。其中，目前紀錄量高的要算阿蕭蘭國際選手「譯昻士亞顯」，他為了一萬鎊的代價，綏然由「此路花士東特隊」跳過「盧屯市隊」。</p>
<p>綜以本季跳槽的市場，各隊活動最感積極的要算「北明罕隊」，糨為了購買新球員六名，總共耗了五萬八千鎊；反之，它為了讓出隊中聲明遼　的球員三名，也獲取了相當的厚利。此外，球隊因跳槽活動而付出代價最主者要算「紐嘉素聯隊」，數字也達五萬鎊之譜；不過，它為了讓了球中多名，獲利也總算相抵。其次，付出最高代價者，是「亞斯屯威斯」隊，總數達四萬四千鎊。</p>

<h3 id="c130">褒廉吏 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>張契渠</p>
<p>最近，我在某報上讀到一篇「廉吏外傳」，引起了無限感慨。</p>
<p>所記廉吏，係指前財政部國稅署署長姜書閣君。據云，此公自孫科出長行政院時辭官來滬後，整居逆旅，窘困異常，海上工商界，最近正在爲他籌維生之計。我和此公既無一面之緣，便是他的大名也還是第一次聽到，決沒有代他鼓吹宣傳的理由。但，假使該報所載無偽，我想站在一個老百姓立塲，我是有理由爲他鼓吹一番的。</p>
<p>在一班人——尤其是年輕人——的心目中，「廉吏」二字早已成爲歷史上的名辭了。誠然，我們日常所聽到所見到的貪汚新聞，貪汚談吐，貪汚行爲太多了，不免令人有「有吏皆汚，無官不貪」之感。其實，十步之內，常有芳草，何况偌大一個政府，豈可一概而論。就我所知，僅稅務方面，便曾有二位絕對廉潔的好官，一位是洛陽直接稅局長李君，係在抗戰中期病逝任所，死後遺產，祗有法幣二十多元，按當時市價，足够買一尺白布。後來由大家捐錢埋殮的；一位是貴陽稅務局長，在抗戰末期死去，身後蕭條，無以善後，曾載陪都各報。當他們活着的時候，誰相信稅務人員會沒錢的？即使身裝差些，也必以爲是馬二先生之流，裝窮罷了！可是人能裝假，直裝到死，甚至裝到死後嗎？</p>
<p>在目前的上海政府機關中，就我所知，也不乏淸廉之士。因爲他們正在馬上，免被誤會起見，恕我不提他們的大名了。</p>
<p>假使我們對於貪汚份于口誅筆伐，認爲非澈度肅淸不可，而對於廉潔之士却祗報之以一聲微喟，那不僅是不公平，而且是不應該的，同時也是無補於事的。因爲今日貪汚之多，固由於經濟，社會，政治等制度的不良，而風氣之壤，顯然亦爲重要因素之一。若干今日痛駡貪汚的靑年，明日厠身社會竟是貪汚的能手，這是什麼道理？社會風氣在獎勵貪汚，在培養貪汚。</p>
<p>所以，我認爲要消滅貪汚，與其大聲的喊「殺」，母寗有效的褒揚廉吏。褒廉吏，在社會意義上是直接安慰好人，間接打擊敗類；在敎育意義上是褒揚善良，一示範靑年。</p>
<p>當然，假使整們經濟，政治，社會制度有澈底與合理的改革，使廉吏們得到更有力的合怯保障，自屬最好；否則，若聽那班私挪公帑，利用職權爲姨太太說情之輩，無法無天，而任令公忠爲民的廉潔之士窮途潦倒，無人過問，我敢斷言，其後果是更加要不堪設想的。</p>
<h3 id="c131">怪法律 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>

<h3 id="c132">「春雷」再評價 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 王冊</p>
<p>表面上「風花雲月」「妖艷嫵媚」的「春雷」，骨子里却是一張有霉素，有問題的影片。</p>
<p>且看看「春雷」的主題，如若劇作者强調的部份，是所謂「敎育第二代」，但在「春雷」里，李含芬那篇漂亮動人的說敎，却只是爲封建社會張目，爲他丈夫個人的傳種接代來說服沈曼麗而已。</p>
<p>李含芬聞丈夫落海而死以後，她的不惜分出一半家產，不惜對沈曼麗委曲求全，忍氣吞聲，總括的說，祇是想爲她傳聞失踪的丈夫，留下這一門香火與後裔；這種狹小的自私的封建觀念的毒素，居然今天還能公開地傳布，眞是咄咄怪事。而劇作者以「敎育第二代」的糖衣，來掩護他這種不健康的細菌，我們眞爲今日的中國影壇憂慮。</p>
<p>其次，在人物性格方面，劇作者與導演完全無法控制。尤其是沈曼麗這一個角色，在個性的刻劃上，分不淸她是何等樣人物·她在衆目昭彰之下，誘惑潘叔明的傷面，即使一個娼妓，也當有所顧忌的；說她是「名媛」與「交際花」吧，而在與潘叔明發生肉體關係以後，却又純潔得像個聖女，表示不願意接受潘叔明一個錢。若說沈曼麗是眞心戀愛潘叔明，但我們看見兩人在上飛機之前，又完全是陌路人，不當「一見傾心」如此。</p>
<p>最後，讓我們來看看「春雷」的藍本敵偽影片「桃李爭春」的情形吧。</p>
<p>「桃李爭春」是敵偽時代攝製的影片，我們不能不承認，在敵偽監製之下，它們是一支散布毒素，麻醉人民的可怕的細菌隊。「桃李爭春」應該禁映，那麼，套取「桃李爭春」故事而仍然充滿麻醉意味的「春雷」，又應該怎樣呢？</p>
<h3 id="c133">古代的藝術展覽室 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>在南美秘魯境內，靠近納茲克古城地方，美國科學家包爾·攷索克敎授，新近發現了世界上最大的藝術展覽室。</p>
<p>這個古代的巨型藝術展覺室，是一個廣達兩百平方哩的露天沙漢，上面佈滿了鳥類。蜘蛛·植物和多頭蛇的龐然巨像。它也是巳知的天文圖中的最大者。依據精確數學所繪成的無數直綫和幾何圖形，標註出太陽的運動，其中有許多是用成排的圓石子嵌在沙中來標註的，從地平面上望去不大容易看出來。攷索克敎授是從空中攝影中，發現了這個業已消失的文化的偉蹟。「美國自然歷史博物院」估計這些圖形，約有兩千年的歷史了。攷索克敎授認爲，那些綫之中，有些是表示星球的運動的。許多巨大的圖畫的秘密，迄今仍無人能解。蜘蛛的圖形淸晰的表現出蜘蛛的身體各部份，和它的八條腿。蒼鷹的像有喙，有爪，有尾，雙翼奮張，長達一百五十碼。它們是部落民族的圖騰嗎？是宗敎的標記嗎？抑或是企圖向太陽或者星球打信號嗎？這些都是未解之謎，有待近代的科學家們作更進一步的探索研究。</p>
<h3 id="c134">奇疾頌 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>宋莊季裕「鷄肋篇」有云：「參知政事孟庾夫人徐氏，有奇疾，每發於聞見，即舉身戰慄，至於幾絕。……又惡聞徐姓及打銀打鐵聲。買物不得見有餘錢，亦不欲留一文。嘗有一婢使之十餘年，甚得力，極喜之。一日，偶聞其家所爲業，婢云：「打銀」。疾亦遂作，更不可見，竟逐去之。……</p>
<p>這種毛病，確是奇疾。女人厭聞母家之姓，郤亦奇突。至於銀和鐵這兩樣東西，也實在是可惡。世界上如果沒有鐵，那戰爭就決不會發生；就是發生，也決不至十分慘酷。至於銀子這東西，更是可惡，古今多少人受到它的大害。那位夫人所聽打銀打鐵的聲音，其實不但不能稱爲奇疾，更宜稱爲美德。如果世界上的人都怕聽打銀打鐵的聲音，天下豈不太平？無奈現在的人，上也者在爲爭煤鐵的資源而發動戰爭；一般人呢，「洋錢一響，眼目淸亮。」烏眼珠看見白洋錢，無不高興萬分。銀洋愈多愈妙，大頭最好，小頭也不壞，決不會如那位夫人「不欲留一文」，就是杜甫也還要「留得一錢看」呢。王夷甫平生口不言錢，惟稱「阿堵」，其實他講的還是錢。——不過，現在到處是眞刀眞槍，滿街銀洋可可作響，那位夫人倘使生在今日，那就一天也活不了。</p>
<p>我祈禱上帝使天下的夫人們都遘此「奇疾」，那麼老爺們一定都肯兩袖淸風，禮讓爲國，從此天下太平，豈不漪歟盛哉！因作「寄疾頌」。</p>
<p>那位相國夫人徐氏惡聞徐姓，我在初寫此文時還感到莫明其妙，其實也是美德。因爲由此證明她決不會有要求她的老爺任用大小舅子等情。我疑心莊季裕此文是寓言，倘使在宋朝眞有此奇疾，那我眞表遺憾，爲什麼這種可以治國平天下的好病，竟沒有流傳到今天呢？——附記·</p>
<h3 id="c135">美術與人類文化 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>——為美術節作</p>
<p>葛羅賽著「藝術之起源」說人類的內心衝動，便產生直覺的美感作用；賴那克著「亞波羅藝術史」說，藝術品是人類勞動的結晶；前者重在精神而言，後者重在物質而言。總之，美術品的產生，總不外乎人類的精神活動與物質活動的結果。</p>
<p>人類既然產生了美術作品，反過來再看美術品對於人類生活又有什麼效用呢？最初原始民族的美術，大多以當時的禽獸爲題材，用來裝飾身體和武器，誇耀自身的勇武，和發揮工具的效力；一方面又置諸洞穴，祈禱出獵的勝利，這是他們把美術品逐漸寄託於日常生活中了。埃及和兩河流域的民族，留下不少偉大的墳墓藝術，因爲那時那些民族，信仰永生，重視死後的人生，才是快樂的生活，那些「金字塔」和「高毫塔」，便是他們畢生的經營，同時也使他們的精神有所依歸。希臘民族的神廟，羅馬民族的宮殿，中世紀的敎堂建築，在在都是當時人人所必需要的東西。至於近代文化之開始，卽歐洲文藝復興時期，各方面藝藝術，無論建築，雕刻，繪畫，工藝，光輝燦爛，遂使整個的歡洲，甚至世界的人類生活，因爲美術之發達，而一切文化從此突飛猛晋，科學也漸漸發展，商業也漸漸發達，人類的生活和享受，都增加了不少的幸福。所以「文藝復興」這一個劃時代的運動，使至今一般人士還在懷想道個美麗的世紀，是何等偉大！</p>
<p>再論我中華民族，與埃及·美索不達米亞及印度，並稱爲世界最古的民族文化，而今只有我中華民族可稱爲獨立完整，仍在生生不息地繼續，承繼祖先的文化和創造未來的新興文化。祖先的美術品，已散佈到世界各國大美術館中，被他們頂禮崇拜。即如世界藝術中心巴黎畫派，所謂後期印象主義，野獸主義，以及最近的抽象主義，無非在吸收我國繪畫的綫條美的結果，抽象主義更涉獵於我國寫意與書法之抽象性的道理。於是一片秦博，一角漢瓦，亦被視爲至寶；唐宋之繪畫在國際上巳爲價値連城，地位之崇高，且有日盛一日之趨勢焉。</p>
<p>因此說到今後我們應如何承繼祖先的煇煌遺產？和如何創造出新中國的美術新路？在今天美術節，我們全美術界的人士，不可不深深管惕與嚴格檢討的了。我們今天站在戰禍迷漫，人民生活極度苦難之中，看到美術之被摧殘，以致形將不能生存的地步，我們要拯救這種危難，其意義是更加深遠。因爲若果推究國家紛擾至如此地步，其主要原因在於文化上之劇烈衝突，固有文化，自明淸以來衰落至極，一蹶不振，而又羼入了西方文化的不協調之破壞，乃至於從事文化工作者各執一是，相互摒斥。其緩和者，彼此詆譭而不合作；其激烈者，訴之火拼動武，忽視了固有文化的眞價値，盲自地輸運不適用的外來文化，在我們美術界既不能有超越前人的作品，亦缺乏具有個性的，代表民族性的西洋美術的一類作品之產生，馴至徬徨歧途，無所適從。我們懲前毖後，應該從今以後，每個作家能够盡力接受本國美術的精英，同時努力吸收西洋美術的長處，目標集中，步調一致，則不難走上和平統一和美麗燦爛的境地了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Government Peace Talk Representatives Determined; Immediate Consultation to Discuss Peace Talk Procedures; Hoping the CCP Will Also Quickly Send Representatives; Opinions on Location and Date to Be Provided Promptly <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Executive Yuan has, on the 24th, appointed peace representatives and urged the CCP to immediately send representatives to begin peace talks. Of the five government representatives, Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Li Zheng are all in Nanjing; Huang Shaohong can fly to Nanjing from Hong Kong immediately; and Zhang Shizhao is also scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the night train of the 24th. Afterwards, they will, under the joint deliberation of Acting President Li and Premier He, prepare the basis and steps for peace talks, collect various data, and prepare to begin peace talks. Before the adjournment of the Executive Yuan meeting, the spokesperson first announced to reporters: "The government deeply feels that the early realization of peace is the most urgent requirement of the people of the whole country. Therefore, Premier He, at the beginning of his duties today, convened an Executive Yuan meeting to discuss various issues related to promoting peace. It was resolved to appoint Mr. Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Shizhao, and Li Zheng as government peace talk representatives. It is hoped that the CCP will also quickly appoint representatives and propose opinions on the location of the peace talks and the date of the start of the peace talks, in order to facilitate the peace talks and appease the desires of the people of the whole country."</p>
<p>Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Shizhao, Li Zheng</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the government's peace talk representatives were approved by the Executive Yuan meeting, an important consultation will be held in Nanjing at 9:00 a.m. on the 25th to discuss the order of the peace talks. Mr. Zhang Shizhao, who was staying in Shanghai, received a notice from Premier He yesterday and went to Nanjing by night train to attend the meeting. After the meeting, he will return to Shanghai and wait for the decision of the delegation's departure date before going to the designated location to meet and set off. Before leaving Shanghai, Mr. Zhang said: "Premier He's invitation to non-Party members to serve as peace talk representatives shows the magnanimity of the Kuomintang, which is deeply admirable. I firmly believe that seeking peace with this fair attitude has a great hope of success. I am willing to take this good opportunity to serve the people of the whole country and do my best to mediate between the KMT and CCP representatives, so that the peace talks can be successful." The location of the peace talks has not yet been decided. During the previous negotiations in Peiping, the CCP representatives mentioned three places: Beiping, Qingdao, and Shijiazhuang. After the government's peace talk representatives gather in Nanjing, they will consult with the CCP on the location and procedures of the peace talks before making a decision. It is expected that the departure can be made within ten days. When asked by reporters whether third-party figures will participate in the peace talks, Mr. Zhang said: "This is a direct consultation between the KMT and the CCP. Other parties and public representatives will not participate. If peace can be achieved, it is possible to reopen political consultations including other factions." Mr. Zhang emphasized that both sides have sincerity in this peace talk. Although the CCP has military actions in Jiangbei, it is also a nature of preparing for war and seeking peace, which is no different from Jiangnan. During the peace talks, he personally believes that the Communist army will not cross the river, because such a move would greatly affect the CCP's credibility. Regarding the content of the CCP's demands revealed by Deputy Director Wu Tiecheng in Guangzhou, Mr. Zhang did not provide responsible confirmation, but said that it was mentioned, but it was quite general.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] He Yingqin, the premier of the cabinet, and ten cabinet members who had already arrived in Nanjing, took office and commenced their duties at the Presidential Palace at 10:00 a.m. this morning, and immediately held their first Executive Yuan meeting. Those in attendance included He Yingqin, Jia Jingde, Zhang Zhizhong, He Yaozu, Li Hanhun, Sun Yueqi, Xu Yongchang, Liu Gongyun, Duanmu Jie, Zhang Zhiben, Bai Yunti, and Chuan Bingchang (Ye Gongchao substituting). Those present in an observer capacity included Gu Zhutong, Huang Shaoju, Pang Songzhou, and Ni Jiongcheng. The meeting began at 10:30 a.m. First, Premier He invited the Acting President to say a few words. Li briefly explained his expectations for the new cabinet and hoped that the new cabinet could unite and work hard to achieve the goal of seeking peace. Li then withdrew. Then the formal meeting began. He immediately delivered a speech, announcing the cabinet's four major goals for the current period. Subsequently, Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Ye Gongchao, Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang, and Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong reported on foreign affairs and military affairs, respectively. At the end of the meeting, the following cases were discussed: (1) The appointment of peace talk representatives: Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, Zhang Shizhao, and Li Zheng were appointed. At the same time, it was hoped that the CCP would quickly send representatives to explain the time and location of the peace talks, so that they could proceed quickly. (2) Drafting of policy guidelines: Based on the four goals proposed by He on the 24th: striving for peace, reforming the military, reforming politics, and stabilizing people's livelihood, and referring to the policies of the previous cabinet led by Sun Ke, taking the strengths and discarding the weaknesses, the heads of each ministry and commission were instructed to provide opinions. A temporary Executive Yuan meeting will be convened on the 28th to gather and discuss the opinions, and a concrete plan will be drafted and reported to the Legislative Yuan on the 30th. (3) Draft Organic Law of the Ministry of Economic Affairs: First, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was instructed to trial it, and then submit it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The organization of the draft law is that the Ministry of Economic Affairs would set up two directorates: Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, as well as the Resources Committee and three departments: General Affairs, etc. (4) Reorganization of the Anhui Provincial Government. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 p.m., and a photo was taken for commemoration.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] He Yingqin said in his speech at the first Executive Yuan meeting on the 24th: "I have repeatedly declined the appointment of President of the Executive Yuan, but I have not been allowed to do so. I can only try my best to live up to the important trust. However, at this difficult time, I rely on everyone's efforts to overcome difficulties together. The new cabinet has already been formed, and I am deeply grateful and appreciative to all gentlemen for their willingness to participate and take on arduous tasks. I have always been in charge of military affairs and have rarely asked about politics. However, observing the current situation, the government's primary goals are fourfold: (1) Striving for peace. Years of war and flames are everywhere, and the people's suffering has reached its extreme. Therefore, seeking peace should be the unanimous wish of the people of the whole country. I believe that only by broadening our horizons and maintaining the greatest tolerance and sincerity can we achieve peace at an early date. (2) Reforming the military. In order to rectify military discipline and reduce the burden on the people, we must first reform the military. In the past, the number of National Army quotas was not completely accurate, and military discipline was not completely rectified. We should actively rectify, verify, and reorganize them, and improve the conscription system and the treatment of palace soldiers, so as to ensure that the military quota is not false, military discipline is strict, and a strong national defense force is truly formed. (3) Reforming politics. If we want to rise up, revitalize our abuses, and reverse the atmosphere, there is no other way to follow except to reform politics. Such things as simplifying administrative agencies at all levels, improving administrative efficiency, cutting redundant staff, eradicating corruption, implementing local autonomy, and strengthening democratic constitutionalism are all important things that we should properly plan and actively implement, wash away the old dirt, and start anew with the people. (4) Stabilizing the people's livelihood. Today, the country's finances and finance have been exhausted, and the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. It is urgent to correct the source and make repairs to remedy the situation. In terms of symptomatic treatment, we must reform the military, cut agencies, and tighten all unnecessary expenditures to reduce their outflow, rectify taxation, prohibit floating abuses, levy property taxes to unblock their source, raise funds widely, contract currency, and maintain currency confidence. In terms of radical cure, we must implement planned economy, strive for public-private balance, national wealth, reorganize state-owned enterprises, strictly prohibit competing with the people for profit, reward private enterprises, and prosper industry and commerce, so as to achieve economic socialization and the people's livelihood will become increasingly stable. The above-mentioned points have either been clearly instructed by the Acting President or have been discussed and studied by the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans. They are all urgent matters. I deeply feel that the burden is heavy, and I will do my best to serve with loyalty and sincerity. I hope that all gentlemen will cooperate and assist more, so that the above-mentioned points can be realized one by one. This is not only my sincere prayer."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The problem of whether the Executive Yuan should stay in Nanjing or Guangzhou has been resolved at the first Executive Yuan meeting on the 24th. The decision is that the political center of the Executive Yuan is in Nanjing. The heads of various ministries and commissions and one of their political vice ministers will handle political affairs in Nanjing. All political committee members are also in Nanjing. The Joint Office of the Executive Yuan will be cancelled from today. The liaison offices of various ministries and commissions in Nanjing will be renamed as the Nanjing Office of each ministry and commission. Permanent vice ministers of various ministries and commissions, and directors and section chiefs who have already arrived in Guangzhou will remain in Guangzhou to handle affairs. Those who have been dispatched to work in places other than Nanjing and Guangzhou or in affiliated agencies will remain at their original locations. After this method is determined, the powers and responsibilities will be clear, and the administration can enter the right track from now on. At the Executive Yuan meeting on the 24th, the issue of handling the employees who were dispersed and left their jobs by the previous Executive Yuan was also discussed for a long time. Because there is now a saying that the Executive Yuan will resume working in Nanjing, the employees who have been dispersed have successively requested reinstatement. Whether they can be approved was studied at the meeting, and the Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun, Minister of Interior Li Hanhun, Secretary-General Huang Shaoju, and Director of Budget Pang Songzhou were appointed to jointly propose a method, which will be decided at the temporary Executive Yuan meeting on the 28th.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The military innovation plan, under the leadership of President He Yingqin, has been drafted and is nearing completion after holding many meetings. Some of the troop reorganizations have already begun to be implemented. As far as is currently known, the plan mainly includes three parts: (1) Verifying troop quotas and reducing them to the target of 4 million people. According to recent statistics, there are approximately 4.2 million officers and soldiers in military agencies and troops nationwide. If some numbers are no longer replenished, the goal of 4 million can be achieved quickly. (2) Abolishing and merging agencies and reducing personnel. This part has been gradually implemented. (3) Improving the treatment of officers and soldiers. The plan to pay salaries in silver dollars has been drafted. After the new salaries are approved, it is hoped that it can be implemented starting in April. The new treatment stipulates that, including food allowances, the monthly salaries of soldiers are: Private 4 yuan, Private First Class 4.5 yuan, Lance Corporal 5 yuan, Corporal 7 yuan, Sergeant 8 yuan, Staff Sergeant 9 yuan. Officers are discounted according to the "National Crisis Salary": Lieutenants 70%, Captains 60%, Generals (unreadable)%.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] After completing the reorganization, the Communist forces in Jiangbei have now officially begun to gradually increase pressure on the National Army's bridgehead positions. Among them, from the border of Hubei and Anhui, Yuxikou (opposite Wuhu), Jiangpu, and the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, and Dahekou (southeast of Liuhe) continue to remain calm. There are still minor contacts in Yizheng, Shierxu, Guazhou, and Shijiaqiao. In Kouan (south of Taixian), Qianshan, Taihu, and Wangjiang, etc., limited by terrain, the outposts were automatically abandoned on the 21st. In Anqing, starting on the night of the 22nd, more than 10,000 Communist troops began to move south from Gaohebu, Qianshan, in two routes, and on the evening of the 23rd, they engaged in fierce fighting with the defending forces on the outskirts of Anqing on the line of Jixianguan-Xilu Wanshankouzhen (more than ten miles from Anqing City).</p>

(2) Lin Biao's troops have indeed moved south from Xuzhou, but he cannot confirm that three armies have arrived at Zhulong Bridge, west of Dixian.

<h3 id="e21">Editorial: A Plea from the Industrial Sector <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Industrial Association telegraphed President He on the 23rd, lamenting the crisis in the industrial sector and offering four suggestions regarding the government's current industrial policies: (1) Reinstate separate listings for overseas remittances and foreign exchange transfer certificates, and maintain the import-export linkage system; (2) Effectively suppress usurious interest rates; (3) Abolish the practice of collecting commodity taxes in kind; and (4) Strictly control imports and exports. At a time when national industrial production is in a state of stagnation, the government authorities should have already been seeking ways to remedy the situation and gradually revitalize it from its sluggish state. Now that the Municipal Industrial Association has put forward four suggestions, the government authorities should pay special attention and immediately adopt them. Leaving aside the principles and theories of economics, these four suggestions, in reality, are not only the lifeline of national industrial production but also the key to rescuing the national economic crisis.</p>
<p>The crisis faced by such productive enterprises is not unique to government-controlled areas; the communist areas are also feeling it. At the conclusion of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held in Shijiazhuang, a warning was issued to CPC members, stating that the central work of the CPC has shifted from rural areas to cities. If the production work in cities cannot be restored and developed, then the Communist Party will not be able to stand firm and will inevitably fail. This further clarifies the importance of urban production work. If the financial and economic policies planned by our government disregard the urgent appeals of the industrial sector and cause production to suffer, then the government will inevitably face a fate of failure. Today, the government should strive to compete with the CPC in supporting industrial production.</p>
<p>We believe that the reasons for the current stagnation of general industrial production, in addition to the unstable overall environment of the political situation, include the following factors:</p>
<p>First, production costs are too high. Because most of the raw materials required by our country's industries are imported from abroad, and the prices of foreign exchange transfers have recently soared, production costs have also increased accordingly. Anyone who pays attention to market conditions knows the situation of rising foreign exchange certificate prices. On December 12th of last year, the foreign exchange certificate was priced at 25 gold yuan per US dollar, and by January 26th of this year, it had risen to 170 yuan, an increase of seven times in seventy days, a relatively moderate increase. However, by March 16th, it had soared to 6,875 yuan, an increase of forty times in fifty days. This kind of surge is really too alarming! Moreover, since March 16th, the surge has not stopped. The price on the 17th was 7,425 yuan, on the 18th it was 8,500 yuan, on the 19th it was 8,675 yuan, on the 21st it was 9,835 yuan, on the 22nd it was 10,250 yuan, on the 23rd it was 10,700 yuan, and yesterday it even rose to 11,500 yuan. From these statistics, it can be seen that the price of foreign exchange certificates is rising faster than any commodity price, and there is indeed a deliberate intention to lead the rise in prices. In other words, raw materials are rising faster, far exceeding the increase in finished products. Normally, there is a saying that "when the water rises, the boat rises," and industrial production is not afraid of rising raw material costs. However, in today's situation, due to the special objective environment, such as shrinking sales areas and reduced purchasing power, the boat has risen, but it has not been able to elevate. Who would be willing to do this kind of loss-making business? Therefore, factories that have already been established have had to reduce or suspend production in order to reduce losses, and newly established factories that have not yet started operations have had to stop halfway and temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Second, sales of finished products are sluggish. Under the current circumstances, apart from the daily necessities of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, the sales of all other finished products are very weak. On the one hand, the rapid inflation of the gold yuan has drastically reduced the purchasing power of the general public to a very small extent. Apart from the necessities of daily life, which they have to buy, they have no money to buy other finished products. On the other hand, due to the uncertainty of the situation, whether it will be peace or war, even those who can afford to buy goods stop at the sight of them. In addition, the "gambling trend" is promoted by the authorities, and everyone is turning to financial commodities. Gold, silver, and foreign currencies have become the targets of those with purchasing power. Therefore, financial commodities are rising every day, and only food is also rising along with them. Other general commodities cannot follow suit and lag behind; otherwise, no one will be interested. Indeed, in a period of inflation, the sluggish sales of finished products are not enough to abuse industry and commerce; they may even be beneficial to industry and commerce. However, under today's high-interest rate situation, everything is completely different. The official interest rate for bank loans is 60 yuan per day, and the interest rate on the black market sometimes exceeds 100 yuan per day. Therefore, calculated with daily compound interest, the interest on a loan of one yuan is six cents per day, and the total principal and interest in one month amount to six times. If this remains unchanged for a long time, the total for twelve months of the year can reach over 21 billion times! This situation is making it difficult for factories to advance or retreat. If they want to calculate costs and refuse to sell at low prices, borrowing money to survive, they will not be able to bear the burden of high-interest rates. Conversely, if they painfully cut prices and sell off, then the income they receive will definitely not be enough for reproduction. We said before that 80 to 90 percent of the factories in Shanghai in December and January may have to declare "closed for good." Now it seems that they may not even have to wait until after December and January!</p>
<p>In short, the suggestions made by the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association to the government are the urgent priorities for the government to save the crisis of industry and commerce. Especially in the current situation where industry is in a predicament of "wanting to live but not being able to live, wanting to die but not being able to die," it cannot be taken lightly. Industry is the lifeline of national survival. If industry goes bankrupt, what else is there to talk about national economy and people's livelihood! We earnestly hope that the He Cabinet will understand public opinion and quickly decide on countermeasures to save industry.</p>
<h3 id="e22">US Aid Gains New Momentum: US Government Notifies China to Prepare a Formal Plan; Government Designates Personnel to Draft Short-Term Plan for Completion <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] US aid funds have recently made new progress. The US government has notified our country to immediately prepare a formal plan to be sent to the US for reference and for use during Congressional discussions. It is reported that the government has designated personnel to draft the plan starting today, and it is expected to be completed in the short term and sent to the United States. Foreign Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao mentioned this matter briefly during the political affairs meeting on the 24th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Secretary of State Acheson declared today that, regarding aid to China, the US government currently supports limiting it to the remaining funds under the existing legislation, and hopes that Congress will approve the proposal by Representative Judd, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to allow the use of these remaining funds until June 30th. The current aid to China legislation expires on April 3rd. Apart from this, the US government cannot consider a more far-reaching aid to China plan for the time being.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Representative Judd introduced a bill in Congress today advocating that the current economic aid to China plan be extended from April 3rd to June 30th, but with no new appropriations. The only difference between Mr. Judd's bill and Mr. Chi's bill is the length of the extension. Mr. Judd told a Central News Agency reporter that Mr. Chi's bill advocates extending the plan to the end of the year, while he advocates extending it for ninety days because the US government and Congress must re-examine the situation in China during these three months. Mr. Judd stated: Mr. Chi's bill represents the government's policy towards China, intending to distribute the unspent funds from the economic aid to China plan in September to delay the State Department's further consideration of aid to China.</p>
<p>Rowing Against the Current: Double the Effort by Duanmu Feng</p>
<h3 id="e23">US Consul General Cabot's Speech: Policy Goal Toward China: Maintain the Historical Friendship Between the Two Peoples <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, this city] US Consul General to Shanghai, Cabot, stated on the evening of the 24th that the "highest goal" of US policy toward China must be to "maintain the historical friendship between our two peoples."</p>
<p>Cabot delivered his speech at the Armed Forces YMCA.</p>
<p>He stated: "The asset of unlimited value that we have for solving this problem (i.e., US policy toward China) is the friendship and trust of the Chinese people in us. We possess this asset because the Chinese people have known for a century that our actions have shown us to be honest and relatively disinterested friends. In the current situation, we should help the Chinese people formulate their own solutions, but we must not impose our solutions on China in such a way as to discard this asset."</p>
<p>Cabot vehemently refuted the Communist Party's accusation of "American imperialism" in China, calling this accusation "unreasonable and contradictory." He pointed out that the Communist Party's common tactic is often to "accuse others of what they themselves are doing." Regarding this point, he cited the record of imperialist acts committed by the Soviet Union in China.</p>
<p>Cabot stated: "We have repeatedly tried to help China, but some Chinese people mistakenly believe that we intend to exploit and rule them, which is truly perplexing. The Soviet Union has a long record of imperialism, successively plundering Tannu Tuva, Outer Mongolia, and Lushun, occupying Dalian, obtaining many privileges in Manchuria, and currently attempting to gain a special position in Xinjiang. Yet they believe that the Soviet Union is their closest friend, which is also puzzling."</p>
<p>Cabot responded to the CCP’s accusation that Nationalist leaders were completely subservient to the United States. He said, "Due to the past arrogance of other countries, the Chinese people have developed a kind of sensitivity, which is reasonable," but in view of this, the United States has not dared to offer advice to China that it would not hesitate to offer to other friendly countries. "It is also a fact that the Chinese government often rejects our requests based on its independent sovereignty. For example, they often fail to adopt our friendly suggestions, such as our suggestion that they give greater respect to the freedoms enshrined in the United Nations Charter, even in wartime." This opinion was not adopted.</p>
<p>Cabot also refuted the Communist Party's claim that the purpose of US aid was to expand US economic interests. Cabot stated: "We have $120 million invested in China, of which $46 million is invested in hospitals, universities, and similar non-profit organizations. Does the Communist Party believe that we are spending $400 million a year in aid to protect this investment?"</p>
<p>"In fact, we are helping China resist the threats of foreign tyranny, and of course, we are not considering our economic interests in doing so. We do not want to exploit China, and even if we wanted to exploit China, we could not do it."</p>
<p>Cabot emphasized that the Chinese people can solve China's problems and said that "the essence of dictatorship - whether it is communism or other forms - is violence, while the essence of democracy is persuasion."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 24th] More than ten people's organizations, including the Guazhou Chamber of Commerce, stated that the deployment of the National Army in the area would require cutting off the dike for military purposes.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Capital Garrison Commander-in-Chief Zhang Yaoming broadcast to the citizens of Nanjing at 6:15 PM on the 24th, explaining that the recent increase in robberies has led him to order the responsible agencies to step up their efforts to solve the cases and to formulate methods to prevent bandits. He also ordered each police precinct to thoroughly implement these measures. He also hoped that the news media would assist by publishing fewer destructive articles and more constructive news. Although the capital is facing the front line today, with the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, as long as we are united internally, strive for progress, train and organize the people, and establish a people's defense line, the Communist army will never be able to cross or sneak across.

<h3 id="e33">The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Congress Emphasizes the Importance of Cities, Believing That the Communist Party Must Be Built on Cities in the Future <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to a report from the CPC radio station in Shijiazhuang on the 24th, the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held near Shijiazhuang. The session lasted for eight days and has ended successfully. Thirty-four members of the CPC Central Committee and nineteen alternate members attended the session, and twenty members were absent. Chairman Mao Zedong presided over the meeting and reported on the work to the entire session. The congress approved the work report of the Central Political Bureau since the First Plenary Session of the Party in June 1945 and approved the proposal of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democrats to convene a new political consultative conference to establish a democratic coalition government. The plenary session also ratified Mao Zedong's statement on January 14 and the eight peace conditions he proposed as the basis for holding peace negotiations with the Nanjing National Government and any other local governments and military groups. The central issue of this Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Congress focused on the shift in the focus of the Communist Party's work from rural areas to cities under the current situation. The party pointed out that since 1927, the focus of its revolutionary struggle has been in rural areas, gathering strength in rural areas, using rural areas to surround cities, and then seizing cities. However, today, the task of the Communist Party has restarted the period of going from cities to rural areas and from cities leading rural areas. The Communist Party's decision believes that cities and villages must be closely linked, and it is not permissible to abandon rural areas and only care about cities. It believes that the Communist Party must be built on cities in the future. The CPC pointed out that the Party's future work must use great efforts to lead the urban people to carry out their struggles, and at the same time, it should learn how to manage and build cities. The party believes that the key to managing and building cities is to restore and develop industrial production, including public, private, and handicraft production. In addition, attention should be paid to the organizational work of the Communist Party, the construction of political organs, trade union work, the organization and training of various mass organizations, public security work, and cultural and educational guidance, with restoring and developing industrial production as the central work. The meeting also called on its members to do their utmost to learn industrial production technology and management methods, as well as commercial work closely related to production. The party's declaration clearly warned its party that if the Communist Party fails to achieve rapid development in production work and cannot restore and achieve results, and first improve the lives of workers, the Communist Party and the people of the whole country will not be able to maintain their communist regime and will inevitably be overthrown. The Party earnestly calls on the working class, the peasantry, and intellectuals to serve as the leading and fundamental forces of this dictatorship, and at the same time, it calls for cooperation with the representatives of the petty bourgeoisie and the liberal bourgeoisie to overthrow the Kuomintang and the imperialist forces and transform China from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and from a new democratic country to a socialist country.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 24th] According to the Japanese publication "Zhejiang-Jiangxi Battle Record," the Japanese army's aim in attacking the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway during the war, capturing Wuyi, and seizing Xiangshan, was to steal fluorite, an important industrial raw material in the area. When Chen Yi was in charge of Zhejiang, he devoted himself to mining fluorite and exchanging it with Japan for rails, planning local construction, which was progressing smoothly. However, the Enemy Property Administration and the Assets Committee contended with the Zhejiang Provincial Government for the benefits of fluorite, leading to the fluorite being left to weather and decay. The Zhejiang Provincial Chamber of Commerce, considering that the production of this item was the price of the blood and sweat of the people of Zhejiang, specifically telegraphed the Provincial Government, stating that the proceeds must be allocated for local construction to demonstrate fairness and impartiality.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The authorities here announced today that representatives of the six nations of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg this morning reached an agreement: on the German border, involving approximately 58 square miles of land with a population of 12,000, there are nearly 30 minor revisions. The agreement is scheduled to be announced on the 6th. The rights of residents in the ceded areas will be protected, and there will be no need to change nationality. The border modification includes a village incorporated into the Saar region. It was also stated that, according to the principles recently stipulated by the French Foreign Ministry, French experts are not making annexation demands but are only separating the territory from Germany so that the small area where the water source is located can be used by nearby French villages.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Experts from the six nations of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, after studying the issue of German-Western border adjustments here for a week, decided today to cede 58 square miles of former German territory to the four nations of France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. This proposal will be submitted to the six governments for approval. This discussion only involved small-scale border adjustments. Large-scale adjustments demanded by the Netherlands, including demanding that Germany cede territory to compensate for Dutch land flooded by German troops during the war, will be discussed further.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] Foreign Secretary Bevin, concluding the overall debate on European issues in the House of Commons tonight, stated that we have not yet given up hope for the unity of Germany.

<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Under-Secretary of State Mayhew assured the House of Commons today that Britain and the United States are determined to continue supporting the Greek government in its anti-communist war. Mayhew stated that the House can rest assured that military actions within Greece against rebels supported by foreign countries will not be weakened and will not be limited to the methods used in the past.

<p>Previously, Conservative MP Macmillan pointed out that if the Greek civil war cannot be ended this summer, the morale and public spirit of Greece will tend to collapse. If Greece falls into the Iron Curtain, there will be two immediate consequences: one is that Yugoslavia will become a major accomplice of the Soviet Union due to Tito's downfall, and the other is that the entire Eastern Mediterranean region will become a line hostile to Britain, making the Suez Canal impossible to defend, and Iran will also inevitably fall into the Iron Curtain. Strategically speaking, the British-American group will revert to its original position in the summer of 1940.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] During today's debate in the House of Commons on Germany and Eastern Europe, Conservative MP Macmillan believed that the Soviet Union may be promoting a false appeasement policy in Germany, such as suggesting concluding a treaty with Germany stipulating the end of the four-power occupation of Germany. Macmillan pointed out that this is tantamount to Germany's kiss of death, and the result will be that the "bandit army" formed in East Germany over the past year will carry out a task similar to that carried out in Czechoslovakia, bringing communism to the banks of the Rhine in one fell swoop, destroying all the war gains that the Allied countries have achieved after six years of war. He believes that the only remedy to deal with Moscow's policies is to form a grand alliance to counter it.</p>

<p>Sophoulis stated that the establishment of the United Nations Balkan Committee and the resolutions of the last UN General Assembly both prove the international nature of the Greek situation.

In addition to Shostakovich, the delegation also includes Fadeyev, Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union, and film distributor Chirili.</p>
<h3 id="e58">On the Eve of the Peace Congress: U.S. Releases White Paper: Soviet Refusal to Exchange U.S.-Soviet Culture <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] The State Department released a 36-page white paper on the 24th, detailing the United States' failed attempts to establish cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges with the Soviet Union over the past 15 years. The release of the white paper comes on the eve of the "World Congress of Workers in the Cultural and Scientific Fields for Peace" being held in New York, which Soviet representatives are also attending. The State Department accused the Soviet government of being afraid to let the Soviet people understand the truth about the United States, stating that the department believes that Soviet leaders know that the free exchange of news will "weaken their iron grip on the Soviet people." The white paper further stated that the United States has tried to send scientists, technicians, educators, and artists to the Soviet Union, but "rarely succeeded." In the "few exceptions," Americans who were allowed to enter the Soviet Union were those whom the Soviet authorities deemed "politically acceptable." Conversely, the United States allows "any famous Soviet figures in the arts and sciences to enter the country, regardless of their political views."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 24th Broadcast: Four-power foreign ministers' representatives discussed the Austrian Peace Treaty, and failed to reach an agreement on Yugoslavia's demands for compensation and territory from Austria. Upon the proposal of Soviet representative Zarubin and the agreement of other countries, it was decided to abandon the discussion and instead study the clauses concerning the handling of refugee issues. Zarubin will leave here next week for New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, and it is widely feared that the four-power foreign ministers' representatives' meeting on the Austrian Peace Treaty may not make any progress in this short period of time. After Zarubin leaves, the four-power representatives will face a difficult issue: whether to adjourn or suspend discussions, or to continue discussions with other Soviet representatives.</p>

<p>[United Press, Spartanburg, 23rd] Former Secretary of State Byrnes urged immediate ratification of the Atlantic Pact on the 23rd because the Soviet Union "obviously intends to control the world." Byrnes, at a gathering of veterans of foreign wars, strongly condemned the Soviet Union's post-war policies, stating: "The Soviet Union has used political infiltration and oppression to seize one government after another, until they have controlled half of Europe and obviously intend to control the world." Byrnes stated: Because the Soviet Union only understands the word "force," the United States must continue to rearm and manufacture atomic bombs. He stated: The Atlantic Pact "will help prevent another war and should be ratified without delay."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 24th Broadcast: Churchill left here today by train for Washington to meet with Truman, whom he has not seen in three years. Mrs. Churchill, his daughter, and a retainer accompanied him.</p>

<h3 id="e65">New Commonwealth Structure: Will Include Defense Region: South Africa and Ceylon to Become Defense Centers <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] It has been learned here that after the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference is convened here on April 23, the Commonwealth Defense Ministers' Conference will follow before the end of the year in Colombo. The Commonwealth Prime Ministers will review the three plans for including "republic units" in the Commonwealth organization. The first plan was formulated by Sir Stafford Cripps, with King George as the nominal ruler of the United Kingdom. The core of the United Kingdom is the dominion, which maintains loyalty to the King. The outer dominion does not recognize the throne. The second plan was proposed by India, with the president of the republic as the constitutional representative of the monarch, avoiding using King George as the emperor of all overseas dominions. The third plan is a "regional organization," with the United Kingdom as the center and the dominion as the periphery. The King still maintains the position of dominion emperor. The dominion and the republic unit form a regional organization based on the Commonwealth. For example, the Republic of India will unite with Australia on a regional basis, thereby maintaining direct contact with the Commonwealth. Under this plan, Myanmar may also be allowed to join. It is generally believed that regardless of the outcome of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' meeting, the new Commonwealth structure will prepare for regional defense. The importance of South Africa and Ceylon is ranked first, as the two locations have been selected as defense centers. According to well-informed sources, Lieutenant General Mountbatten may reassume his position at the Kandy headquarters in Ceylon.</p>

<h3 id="e68">This Newspaper Provides Important Clues to the Dismemberment Case; Discovery of the Origin of the Note Inside the Sleeve of the Woman's Jacket; Police Speculate the Case Contains Erotic Elements <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the occurrence of the dismemberment case on Jinkee Road, the bizarre and intricate nature of the case has attracted widespread attention. To ensure accurate reporting of the case, this newspaper has mobilized all staff in the newsroom to assist the police in seeking clues. Late last night, a reporter from this newspaper, in a very accidental opportunity, discovered a calendar hanging on the wall with a strip of adage that read, "Enmity between others and me should be forgotten, not remembered." The wording, font, arrangement, sequence, and length of the note were exactly the same as a lead-printed note found inside the sleeve of the woman's jacket used to pad the corpse in the case. This calendar is a 1949 product of the Huaxin Calendar Factory at 997 Haining Road. In the entire 300-plus pages, only February 11th and October 21st contain the aforementioned adage. The position of the sentence is below the date, arranged from right to left, printed in six-point type. The calendar paper is white newsprint, approximately one and a half inches in length. After discovering this mystery, the reporter from this newspaper immediately inquired by phone with Cheng Yi-kuan, the chief of the Changshu Road police precinct, at 2:00 AM this morning. Cheng was extremely surprised upon hearing this, believing that this discovery would greatly assist the investigation work. He also confirmed that the note inside the package was indeed cut from this type of calendar. This is because, other than the top half of the page, including the date, being completely cut off, everything else is exactly the same. Cheng stated: "Since this adage was printed on the February 11th calendar, it is possible that the murderer, upon seeing this adage on that day, felt it coincided with their motive for killing and therefore retained it. From that day on, they concretely considered methods of murder and corpse disposal, and subsequently decided to implement them." According to the reporter's observation: the entire process, from the murderer's initial intention, to the act, to the cover-up, likely spanned from February 11th to March 21st.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Four Examinations Confirm Hair Turning Black; Determines the Deceased Was Indeed a Chinese National <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Another "reversal" has been discovered in the Jinkee Road headless dismemberment case: based on the results of the fourth detailed examination of the deceased's body, it has been proven that the victim was not a foreigner, but definitely a Chinese national.</p>
<p>During the third examination the day before yesterday, it was determined that the slightly yellowish-white color of the corpse's hair was discovered yesterday to be due to the application of preservatives. Therefore, the color of the hair is now gradually turning black. Furthermore, the entire body's hair follicles are delicate and even, and the nipples on the chest are not large. Although the muscles are firm and the feet are relatively wide, there are also many Chinese people with good physiques. Therefore, after piecing together the body parts and conducting a detailed examination yesterday, the forensic examiners affirmed that the deceased was definitely not a foreigner.</p>
<p>As for why the deceased was killed? And where was the deceased killed? The police officers responsible for investigating the case believe that because the dismemberment of the body was exceptionally clean and without any bloodstains, it can be proven that the murderer spent at least seven hours dealing with the body. Carrying out this kind of work for such a long time must have been done indoors without a doubt. Furthermore, based on the woman's jacket and the child's open-crotch pants used to wrap the body, a woman must have lived in this room. Since no family members or women have come forward to report or show signs of also being victimized since the case occurred, this woman must be suspected of conspiring with the murderer. Regardless of whether this woman had a deeper relationship with the deceased or a closer relationship with the murderer, in short, this case contains a story of erotic entanglements, and it is highly possible that the murderer committed this act out of jealousy. However, it is still impossible to determine whether the murder site was in this city or in another city.</p>
<p>A Worker on Jinkee Road Saw a Passenger Carrying Packages</p>
<p>In addition, the investigating police officers yesterday discovered another new lead: according to "Old Wang," the gatekeeper of the Qilu Villas (the site where the dismembered remains were first discovered was behind the villas), a road worker on Jinkee Road saw a pedicab carrying a passenger get out next to the villas after dusk on the 19th, take a package, and hurriedly follow the dirt road (see attached diagram) towards the field. The situation afterwards was not noticed. Considering that it rained on both the 19th and 20th, and the case was discovered on the morning of the 21st, because the paste on the package was not completely wet, it is determined that the murderer's corpse disposal work was done before dawn on that day. Then, is this passenger carrying packages on the 19th related to this case? The police are currently conducting an investigation.</p>
<p>The Murderer Came from the City; Took Jinkee Road</p>
<p>According to the police's current deduction, at least two or more people participated in the case, from the murder to the corpse disposal. The original shape of the discovered remains was that the package was leaning against the back door of the Qilu Villas, and another travel bag was placed in a small pit. The police point to this as a sign that two people participated in the arrangement at the same time. Furthermore, the nearby area is mostly wasteland, fields, or tomb sites. The murderer often specifically chose a hidden place behind the villas to dispose of the corpse, which shows that they were already familiar with the situation in that area. In terms of transportation, inspections at Hongqiao Airport are quite strict, and the chance of the murderer bringing the corpse to Shanghai by air is very small. If the murderer got off at the Xinhongqiao station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, they could throw away the package anywhere to avoid attention, without having to come specifically near the villas. Since both air and land routes are less likely, the police determined that the murderer came from the city, and that they necessarily took Jinkee Road.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mayor Wu Guozhen has repeatedly telegraphed his resignation due to physical and political exhaustion. The city councilors, in view of Mayor Wu's many achievements over the years, believe that it is not appropriate to change the head of the city hastily at this time of turbulent situation.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yue Tiankai, also known as Tong Wei, altered a Shanghai Municipal Bank draft with the serial number 357716, valued at 500 gold yuan, to 50,000 gold yuan and exchanged it for cash from Zhu Defu. The draft was returned to the municipal bank and discovered on December 3rd of last year. After a tortuous investigation, it was learned that Yue had used it. Later, Zhu Bao and Xu Zhenxiang, agents of the bank, mediated the situation, and Yue admitted to paying in installments. However, the checks he issued were all returned due to insufficient funds. Therefore, the case was brought to the court. After investigation and prosecution by the prosecutor, Ruan Qin, the judge of the district court, pronounced the verdict yesterday: Yue Tiankai used altered valuable securities and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Municipal Industrial Association Convened Various Industries Yesterday; Discussing the Allocation of Gasoline and Diesel <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Industrial Association convened relevant industries at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of gasoline and diesel allocation. Li, the vice chairman of the Transportation Control Committee, and Dong Dingfeng, the group leader of the gasoline and diesel allocation group of the association, attended the meeting. First, Vice Chairman Li reported on the principles and procedures of allocation. Then, representatives from various industries expressed their opinions, which can be summarized into four points: (1) After the allocation quotas of gasoline and diesel for each factory are set, they should be allowed to withdraw oil and pay in installments within the specified time, in order to reduce the economic burden of each factory. (2) There is an increasing number of black market oil on the market, while the Transportation Control Committee allocates very little gasoline and diesel to various industries. Please ask the competent authorities to investigate the source of the black market oil and the reason for the reduction in oil allocation. (3) Request the government to abolish the import limit of gasoline and diesel in order to increase the oil source and stabilize the oil price. (4) In the past, some factories used coal as fuel. Currently, there is a serious coal shortage, and they have to switch to diesel. These factories should be given the opportunity to apply for oil allocation. As a result, Vice Chairman Li agreed with the first point of withdrawing oil and paying in installments. The remaining points will be forwarded to the Transportation Control Committee and the competent authorities for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Base Prices for Hairdressing and Bathing; Social Bureau to Confer and Decide Today; Both Industries Hope to Set a Formula for Gradual Adjustment <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The base prices for hairdressing and bathing, which were previously drafted by the two industry associations and submitted to the Social Bureau for review, will be decided by the Social Bureau in consultation with representatives of the two industry associations this morning, so that they can be submitted to the municipal government for approval and announcement. According to the person in charge of the Social Bureau yesterday: they are currently reviewing the pre-war account books of the two industries to compare them with the current prices in order to seek a more reasonable base price. Among these two industries, the hairdressing industry is easier to solve than the bathing industry. The common difficult problem for these two industries is that the cost-of-living index is published twice a month, and the prices are also adjusted twice. However, prices fluctuate every day and every hour. Within one or two days after the cost-of-living index is released, the prices suddenly increase, and business will inevitably be slow. Within one or two days before the cost-of-living index is released, because it is lower than other prices, customers will be extremely crowded. These two industries do not want this phenomenon to occur. It is best to increase prices gradually so that daily business maintains a certain level. It is heard that public utilities have a hypothetical index, and they gradually adjust according to this hypothetical index. These two industries also hope to set a formula that includes the calculation of various costs and gradually adjust according to this formula to maintain equilibrium with the rate of price increase so that the distance is not too far. The Social Bureau is considering this method, and a decision will be made at today's meeting.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The three drafts of rent standards in this city drafted by the Land Administration Bureau were submitted to the Municipal Affairs Conference for discussion. At the last Municipal Affairs Conference, because this matter is related to the housing problem of six million citizens in this city, it was inconvenient to pass it hastily and submitted it to the Municipal Government Council Chamber for review and modification. Yesterday morning, Zhu Zhaoquan, the director of the Municipal Government Council Chamber, invited representatives from the Land Administration Bureau, the Real Estate Association, and the Tenants' Association to confer and decide on a more concrete method, which will be submitted to the Municipal Affairs Conference for discussion today.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yang Chunlin, a 23-year-old pedicab driver from Jiangbei, lived at No. 10, Lane 111, Caohejing. Because he had just recovered from an illness, he could not drive a pedicab to make a living. In view of his early illiteracy, he was extremely resentful. Recently, he went to Jianghuai Elementary School on Caoxi Road to study. At around 9:40 AM yesterday morning, Yang was writing in the school (because the teacher had not arrived yet), sitting in the teacher's seat. Unexpectedly, a military unit stationed there was conducting live ammunition exercises in Caohejing. Suddenly, a bullet flew over and hit Yang in the throat, piercing through both sides, and blood spurted out. Later, someone carried him to the nearby Municipal Eighth Hospital, but because the injury was in a critical area, needles and medicine were ineffective, and he died in just over an hour. Afterwards, the Longhua Police Precinct sent personnel to investigate the scene and transferred the body to the Changde Road morgue for examination. The details of the case were reported to the Municipal Police Bureau for approval.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Unoccupied Land in Hartung Garden - Sale Delayed, No Transaction Completed - Ji Juemi Accused of Fraud - Brought to Court Ill, Trial Concluded, Awaiting Verdict - Female Relatives Beside, Constantly Checking Pulse <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Ji Juemi, the elderly chief accountant of Hartung, a Buddhist convert, was accompanied by his female relatives and brought to court ill yesterday in response to a summons from Huang Guangyu, Presiding Judge of the First Criminal Court of the District Court, regarding the lawsuit filed by Huang Sizhao accusing him of fraud in connection with the sale of land in the Hartung Garden. Ji wore Buddhist yellow shoes and carried a cane. The plaintiff in the case, Huang Kezhao, stated in court: On September 15th of last year, Ji entrusted Fan Yunzhan, the manager of the Juemi Trading Company, as his authorized representative, along with staff members Zhang Haitong and Tan Boya, with a letter of authorization personally signed by Ji, to sell five mu, four fen, six ya, and seven hao of unoccupied land within the Hartung Garden on Middle Zhengzheng Road. A sales contract was signed, with a total price of 480,000 Gold Yuan, and an initial deposit of 50,000 Gold Yuan, equivalent to 250 taels of gold at the then current value, was paid. By the seventh day of the following month, the defendant's three representatives sent him a letter demanding payment of the outstanding amount, along with a photograph of a letter from Ji to the representatives, stating that there was no intention to renege on the agreement. He agreed and replied to Fan and others, scheduling the completion of the transaction for the ninth day of the same month. However, when the date arrived, Fan and others avoided meeting. He sent two letters on the 19th and 29th of the same month urging them to proceed, but they were returned on the grounds that they were not in Shanghai. On November 2nd, he sent another letter to the Juemi Trading Company, requesting that it be forwarded to the defendant. He then received a reply from Ji on the 6th of the same month, stating that he was not aware of the above transaction before or after it occurred. Given the actions of the defendant's three representatives, Ji clearly had the suspicion of committing fraud. The civil portion of the case is being litigated separately. The defendant, granted a seat by the court, argued: It is true that he entrusted Fan and the other three to handle the sale of the unoccupied land. However, at the time, he was receiving medical treatment in Hong Kong due to illness. The telegrams from the three did not specify that the price was in Gold Yuan. He believed that the price should be in gold bars due to the devaluation of the Gold Yuan at the time, and there were many unfair terms in the contract, so the transaction was not completed. Ji's answers were given in a low voice, and he frequently spat. His female relatives were beside him taking care of him, constantly checking his pulse, and often interjected on his behalf, all of which were stopped by the court. Next, Fan Yunzhan and the other three were summoned to testify. They all stated that they were unaware of Ji's reply letter on October 6th. Fan also stated: At the time, they were indeed entrusted by Ji to calculate the price in gold units. However, when they signed the contract with Huang, it coincided with the currency system reform, so they calculated the price in Gold Yuan. The defendant had no intention to defraud. The court instructed the lawyers of both sides to present their final arguments, and the verdict was scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Prospects for Zhejiang Farmers' Schools <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng from This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 22nd] Amidst the nationwide drive to increase production, farmers' schools in Zhejiang Province, after more than four months of preparation, have begun teacher training in Songmucheng, a suburb of Hangzhou. This is part of former Zhejiang Province Chairman Chen Gongqia's two major agricultural policies: land reform and farmers' schools. The farmers' school was approved at the 1570th meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee on August 19, 1948. A preparatory committee was established, appointing the directors of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department and Education Department, the director of the Agricultural Improvement Institute, the presidents of the Agricultural Colleges of Zhejiang University, Ying University, and Jinling University, the principal of the Zhejiang Provincial Rural Normal School, the director of the Hangzhou Municipal Garden Management Office, two agricultural problem consultants to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the provincial government member concurrently serving as the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Reclamation Committee as preparatory committee members. The preparatory committee established five secretaries and three clerks to handle daily affairs. After drafting regulations, determining the teacher training venue, and surveying the locations of farmers' schools in various counties, teacher training recruitment began. The training course commenced in January 1949.</p>
<p>Empowering Farmers with Practical Benefits</p>
<p>From Zhejiang's geographical perspective, the so-called prosperous but lacking area refers only to surface production. Because Zhejiang is poor in mineral resources and lacks coal and iron, its future prospects depend on improving surface production. Today, in rural areas, farming power is scattered, agricultural tools are outdated, farmhouses are dilapidated, and the lives of farmers are unbearable. How can we talk about increasing production? How can we talk about improving production? The so-called rural education that provides practical benefits to farmers, cooperative agricultural loans, etc., are merely scratching the surface, not addressing the root of the problem. Because those who provide practical benefits to farmers are disconnected from them, unaware of their needs, and unable to understand their feelings, they cannot live with them and understand their suffering.</p>
<p>Teacher Training: Series A and B</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's farmers' schools were created to address this premise. Their teachers are divided into two series, A and B. Series A focuses on specialized agriculture, while Series B focuses on language and general knowledge. Series A requires a degree from an agricultural college and at least one year of agricultural work experience, or graduation from a senior agricultural vocational school and at least three years of agricultural work experience. Series B requires graduation from a normal school or high school and at least three years of service in agriculture or social administration and cultural education. They recruited 60 people for Series A and 40 people for Series B. In the morning, they attend academic classes, and in the afternoon, everyone goes barefoot to the fields to practice, mastering various new techniques for increasing production, such as cultivation, irrigation, fertilization, and the use of new methods such as machinery. At the same time, they study methods for transforming the impoverished rural environment, such as hygiene, medical treatment, educating children, daily life, and social interaction. Teacher training lasts for six months, after which they graduate and are assigned to farmers' schools in various counties as principals or teachers. After these many teachers go to the farmers' schools, they will actually engage in operations and cooperate with the farmers in the farmers' schools. They will let the farmers learn in doing, and teach the farmers in learning. This of course can better understand their needs and feelings, and at the same time live with them, which can also understand their suffering, and then solve them.</p>
<p>Training Conditions for Farmers</p>
<p>The farmers who receive training in the farmers' schools themselves are not subject to any restrictions, as long as they have practical farming experience, are physically strong, have good character, and are slightly literate, and are between the ages of twenty and thirty-five. Each school mainly has 60 people. During their training period, in addition to all the costs of food, accommodation, and operations being provided by the school, each person is also allocated three to five mu of harvest from the total amount of labor harvested on the farm as a subsidy. Each of them also allocates three to five mu of cultivated land for operation and cooperation. They take operation as a course, fields as classrooms, and school buildings and dormitories use public houses or improved existing farmhouses. If it is necessary to build another one, it must be similar to ordinary farmhouses, and improved to serve as a model for new rural construction. The school site must be chosen to be convenient for transportation and moderately located. After they graduate, they return to their own homes. They become the core of rural improvement in rural society. In the future, all places where the government cooperatively lends and gives practical benefits to the countryside will be handled by farmers who have graduated from farmers' schools, and then lent to the vast countryside. The government can also pass on any laws and regulations to the vast number of farmers through the farmers after graduation. They will also teach the experience they have learned to other farmers. In this way, Zhejiang's rural symbols can be changed. We are very admired by this foresight.</p>
<p>Students in the Teacher Training Class</p>
<p>The reporter was invited to give a special lecture to all the students receiving training in the farmers' school teacher training, and took this opportunity to visit everything in the teacher training class. The 100 students in the teacher training class were all young and strong, wearing the crimson-cyan cotton-padded jackets and trousers that were issued to them. Everyone was quickly sorting out their homework, diligently taking notes in the lecture hall. In the afternoon, everyone worked hard to cultivate the fields. I have visited several students, and they all take transforming the countryside as their duty. They believe that today's farmland in China is not yet "fully employed", so using new technologies and new machinery to cultivate can obtain a large amount of production, and the increase in production can also improve the lives of farmers. They don't want to get rich, nor do they want to become officials. They are willing to take the revitalization of China's rural cause as their lifelong career.</p>
<p>New Machinery and New Technology</p>
<p>I have visited their machinery, including several tractors, a rice threshing machine, harrows, plows, and many shovels. According to the head teacher, Ju Jinsan, "The Central Pest and Disease Research Committee is willing to cooperate with the teacher training class and will be stationed in the class. In addition, the livestock department in the veterinary school is also willing to cooperate with the teacher training class and will be stationed in the class. Therefore, the future of the teacher training class is very bright." Wen is the Dean of the Agricultural College in Taichung, the agricultural center of Taiwan. He has unlimited hope for farmers' schools. The two of us have looked forward to the beautiful prospects of agriculture in Zhejiang Province and even the whole country. With rural areas organized, every farmer will be able to use new machinery and new technologies, and every farmer will be able to operate tractors. There will be machinery repair shops and machinery gas stations between several rural areas. Farmhouses have also been improved, and farmers live very comfortably. All new Chinese industries are developing in coordination with the lives of the vast majority of farmers and agricultural production, and chimneys are erected one by one in the countryside.</p>
<p>Problem of Enrollment Age</p>
<p>After returning from the farmer's school teacher training class, the reporter deeply felt that the enrollment age of this kind of farmer's school for farmers can also be lowered to below 20 years old, because the national primary schools in the countryside that have been promoted to this day, with their rigid classes and the same books as in the cities, have made farmers feel no interest in them at all. Therefore, the reporter has traveled to many rural areas in various provinces of China, and the national primary schools only hang an empty sign, the double doors are tightly closed, and the songs are never able to continue. If we use this method of farmer's schools in Zhejiang Province to educate farmers under the age of 20, then farmers will definitely express their strong support. From this, we think that farmer's schools may be divided into several grades, assuming that the primary class is for farmers under 10 years old to study, the intermediate class is for farmers over 12 years old to study, and the senior class is for farmers over 20 and under 35 years old to study. The senior class can be the current teacher training class, the teachers of the intermediate class are the graduates of the senior class, and the teachers of the primary class are the graduates of the intermediate class. In the primary class, as long as the general teaching materials of the national primary school are added, the emphasis is still on production and practice, according to the highest principle of education "do, learn, teach". In this way, know and transmit immediately, not only will the countryside quickly recover, but the benefits to farmers will also be considerable.</p>
<p>Included in the Education System</p>
<p>Not long ago, the first session of the fifth session of the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly was held, just when Chen Gongqia left Zhejiang and Zhou Fengzhang succeeded him as the head of Zhejiang. In the discussion of the Provincial Assembly, it was believed that the farmers' school spent too much public funds, so it was resolved to request the Provincial Government to abolish it. However, according to the reporter's knowledge, Chairman Ju is currently hesitating, because the representatives of the Provincial Assembly advocate abolishing the school based on public opinion, while the former chairman runs this school and has his own painstaking efforts. The other day, Director of Education Li Jigu gave instructions to his colleagues in the Department of Education, saying that the farmers' school still has to be run, but a few classes should be reduced, because the original regulations stipulated that one school should be established in each of the 30 selected counties starting from the next semester of this year. From this point of view, the farmers' school will still have to be run. Of course, Chairman Zhou also saw the actual situation in the countryside today. The reporter feels that if my opinion above is adopted, and the farmer's school is clearly included in the education system, and the national primary schools in the countryside that are famous but not actually used are abolished and farmer's schools are run instead, wouldn't that be better?</p>
<h3 id="e97">Murder Case in Jianhu Township, Qishuyan - Criminals Li Zijin and Others Detained <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Wujin, 23rd] The village of Shijiatang in Jianhu Township, Qishuyan District, has only seven or eight households. Villager Shi Xilin, over 30 years old, has been a widower for quite some time. Last year, he was introduced to work as a waiter in a theater on the coal cinder beach of the Qishuyan Machine Factory. At the same time, Yang Aren, the wife of Sun Heshang from the same village, a middle-aged woman, also worked in the theater from time to time. Soon, they began living together. However, Yang Aren recently became involved with Li Zijin, a villager from a nearby village, and often secretly met for romantic encounters, which soon led to murder. On the clean night of the 10th, as Xilin and Aren were sleeping together, Sun Heshang suddenly arrived. Li Zijin and three others called Shi Xilin out, never to return. On the 19th, villagers found Xilin's clothes in a mud puddle in Huangni Gou, but no body was found. Later, after dredging, the body of Yang Er was found. The district government immediately arrested Li Zijin, who confessed to the murder of Shi Xilin. The Qishuyan District has now escorted the criminal Li Zijin to the city for interrogation, and Sun Heshang has also been arrested and is on his way to be escorted.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Shanghai and North China Remittance: Xinhua, China Industrial, and Other Banks Begin Trial Operations <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The total amount of remittance for each bank per day is temporarily limited to one million Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Several banks in this city have started handling North-South remittances in recent days. However, the amount of remittance is not large, and it is mostly limited to those who have funds available for transfer in both regions. It is understood that the banks handling remittances between Shanghai and Peiping include Xinhua, China Industrial Enterprise, Salt &amp; Pharmaceutical, Jincheng, and Shanghai. In addition to the above five, the banks handling remittances between Tianjin and Shanghai include Da Mu, Ju Xingcheng, and China General Chamber of Commerce. Yesterday, this reporter inquired about the remittance situation at various banks and confirmed that this remittance is still in the trial stage. Remittances between Tianjin and Shanghai have been suspended for a relatively long time, and there are still technical difficulties to be overcome before they can be resumed. Remittances between Peiping and Shanghai have begun to resume. The following is an account of the remittance operations of several banks: (1) Currently, the targets of remittance are mostly small remittances from public employees, teachers, and students' families. Large commercial remittances have not yet been seen. (2) The remittance rate is 20% according to the regulations of the People's Bank of China, regardless of direction. Most remittances are telegraphic transfers, and funds remitted today can arrive the next day. The telegraphic transfer fee for each remittance from Shanghai to Peiping is 6,000 Gold Yuan. (3) Currently, each remittance from Shanghai to Peiping is approximately 100,000 Gold Yuan, which is converted into Renminbi at the exchange rate of Peiping Renminbi to Gold Yuan on the date of arrival. For example, yesterday's rate was 23 to 1, meaning that 23 Gold Yuan would be converted into 1 Renminbi. (4) It is said that remittances from Peiping to Shanghai must first be applied for to the Communist People's Bank of China and approved before the remittance can be made. Currently, most remittances from Peiping are 3,000 Renminbi. Large commercial remittances can generally reach 5 million Gold Yuan per remittance, with no special restrictions, but such remittances have not yet been handled. (5) The China Industrial Bank of this city has been handling remittances for several days. The maximum amount remitted each day is temporarily set at 1 million Gold Yuan, with each remittance being 100,000 Gold Yuan. There were four or five such remittances yesterday. Xinhua Bank started handling remittances yesterday, with a total of four remittances, amounting to approximately 300,000 Gold Yuan. Many other banks are still observing and have not yet started. (6) These North-South remittances are limited to commercial banks with branches in both North and South China, and those specifically approved by the Communist People's Bank of China to handle remittance business. The financial authorities and banking associations here are not involved in this matter. The banks, from a purely commercial standpoint and adhering to the principle of serving customers, are handling remittance business that is within their original business scope.</p>
<h3 id="e104">National Banks Massively Sell Off, Gold Market Still Strong <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's gold market opened in the morning with a stalemate in trading due to pressure from bank sell-offs. After the market opened at 9:30 am, brokers were shouting offers but no transactions occurred, due to the substantial overnight differences by the banks. Yesterday, the silver market was loose and abundant, and thus people were eager to buy, making it difficult to open the market. Subsequently, Da De Cheng first sold at 5.95 million, and trading began. However, Da De Cheng was selling on behalf of the central bank, and as soon as the price was announced, people were pleased, and there were many sales in the market, so the price fell back to around 5.90 million. However, the decline was limited, the bulls had excessive interest, and the silver market was still loose, and the implicit interest rate was also low, so the holders were unwilling to sell at low prices under pressure, and the market was quickly bought up again, and the price rebounded to 5.95 million, but there were still few sales.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the central bank sold unlimited amounts at 5.95 million, and people's minds stabilized, and the overnight floating bulls sold off at high prices, and the market slightly lowered, and the price was 5.93 million. Subsequently, the off-market trend was high, and people's minds were again firm, and there were buy orders at 5.94 million, and the market fluctuated for a long time. Finally, the floating retail investors considered that the rise was limited, and there were not many buyers, and the sales were frequent, and the market was slightly tired, and closed at 5.93 million at noon.</p>
<p>[Another News] In order to stabilize prices, the central bank massively sold off materials in the gold and cotton yarn markets starting yesterday. In the gold market, 12,700 taels were sold in the morning, recovering 7.55665 billion yuan in currency. In the cotton yarn market, the Textile Construction Company sold 324 pieces of 20-count Dou Chuan yarn, each piece at 1.88 million, and 212 pieces of 20-count Shenhu yarn, each piece at 1.84 million, recovering a total of 1.07 billion yuan in currency.</p>
<p>[Another News] The gold market trend was still soft in the afternoon, because the central bank sold off a large amount in the morning market, and the buying power of the banks had been saturated. The holders who bought in the morning market felt the pressure on their positions, and they were anxious to arrange for it in the afternoon. Some holders also rushed to close their positions, and the market had more supply than demand, and the closing price fell back again. It opened at 5.87 million, and once rose to 5.88 million. After the bulls pulled up the price, they began to sell off again, and the price fell to 5.8 million. Subsequently, retail investors bought in, and the market rose after falling. The closing price was 5.86 million. The above transactions were all for same-day positions, and overnight delivery would require additional interest.</p>
<p>The US dollar market turned around due to the impact of gold sales. The market opened slightly quietly in the morning, the middle trend was stable, and the noon closing price returned. The opening price was 12,200 yuan, 12,300 yuan, and the noon closing price was 12,000 yuan, 12,000 yuan. The opening price for noon support was 11,900 yuan, 1800 yuan, and the closing price was the same.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The money market trend was still loose yesterday. In the morning, due to the large overnight differences by national banks, most industries recorded more buy orders. The overnight interest rate opened at 60 yuan, but it was still difficult to lend out. Later, it fell to 40 or 50 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the large gold sales by national banks, the money market slightly stabilized, and finally the overnight interest rate returned to around 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, national banks had a continued outflow of more than 5.4 billion yuan, foreign merchants' banks had an inflow of more than 800 million yuan, major exchanges had an inflow of more than 1.5 billion yuan, and minor exchanges had an inflow of more than 3 billion yuan.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market continued to make progress, opening higher in the morning. Because the silver market was still loose, all grades rose except for 10-count yarn, which remained unchanged.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fell from 4.25 million yuan to 4.13 million yuan at the close, an increase of 160,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 110,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon rose from 2.8 million yuan to a high of 2.82 million yuan, eventually closing at 2.76 million yuan, an increase of 100,500 yuan.</p>

<p>The cloth market rose and then fell. The initial opening was smooth and people were in good spirits. Various cloths gradually rose. Then, it was heard that the Textile Construction Company was distributing a large amount of cloth, and both Longtou fine cloth and Four Gentlemen poplin were available, so the holders immediately began to sell, and the selling pressure became strong, and the price fell back and forth.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth opened at 18,000 yuan, and then broke through the 90,000 yuan mark, reaching a new high of 90,500 yuan, and then fell back to 83,300 yuan before the close, eventually closing at 84,500 yuan, an increase of 700 yuan.

<h3 id="e109">Market Ramblings: Spectators <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong's Opening of Gold Import Ban Says: Fear of a Buying Spree</p>
<p>Hong Kong, in the past, agreed to the Chinese government's request to ban gold imports. Although it was only a formal ban, in reality, not a small amount still flowed from the mainland. However, when it flowed in, it was all smuggling, and there were inevitably small expenses.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's promise was to help China stabilize its currency value.</p>
<p>It is said that the Hong Kong authorities are now reconsidering this gentleman's agreement. Originally, free import was prohibited, so the current reconsideration is of course considering restoring free import.</p>
<p>This news has already been reflected in the Hong Kong gold market since yesterday.</p>
<p>Since this week, the price of gold in Hong Kong has jumped from 304 yuan to over 314 yuan, once reaching as high as 316 yuan. Because of the news, the price of gold in Hong Kong quickly fell to around 310 yuan.</p>
<p>Let's not underestimate this news from Hong Kong. If it is not true, then everything will remain unchanged. If it is true, the motive is of course to absorb gold from the mainland.</p>
<p>Therefore, the competition for gold between the mainland and Hong Kong, and the future of gold prices, have more reasons to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Judging from the recent news of the devaluation of the pound, the excessive expansion of the issuance of Hong Kong dollars, and the many new events that have been attacked by gentlemen, the possibility of Hong Kong restoring free gold imports is very high.</p>
<p>In the macro environment, we are facing a critical moment.</p>
<p>The stock market's slump indicates many underlying currents. What can be pointed out is that people who were originally investing in a proper manner are selling out at high prices. Even old holdings are being sold off in part. With such high interest rates, retail investors are of course happy to adopt a long-term and profitable strategy. It is said that although most "rats" are multi-necked, they can withstand such high interest rates. They really treat "kings" as fools.</p>
<p>As for the general commodity market, there is a gradual trend towards higher prices. Regardless of whether one is optimistic or pessimistic about the overall situation, those who have foreign exchange relationships and need to import goods seem to hope for the best. The lack of real sales is a temporary situation. Once the situation changes, there will be a fear of a shortage of goods.</p>
<p>According to analysts in various industries, within the scope of commodities, chemical raw materials and essential Western medicines that cannot be replaced domestically can be stockpiled. For example, petroleum jelly and carbolic acid cannot be replaced domestically, so one should look for treasures within the scope of irreplaceable and widely used products. As for prepared medicines, they believe that: (1) foreign inventions are constantly changing, (2) domestic products are also trying to imitate them as much as possible; therefore, good brands are not bad.</p>
<p>Paper was originally a good product. However, recently Europe and the United States have been devaluing and dumping paper, and the quantity shipped to Hong Kong is very large, so there is not much potential in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Loose Money, Rising Production Prices, Rice Market Slightly Firm, Flour Rises and Then Weakens, Oil Prices Remain Firm <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Rice prices have slightly increased because the silver market is loose, and the price of tin has risen. The owners have raised their prices. The prices of various japonica and indica rice in the northern market have increased by 3,000 yuan. White japonica rice is 65,500 yuan, and special japonica rice is 68,000 yuan. The southern market opened with an increase of 3,000 yuan, but later weakened slightly due to sluggish sales. The final increase was 2,000 yuan. White japonica rice is 62,000 yuan, and glutinous rice sales are good, and the market trend is quieter. A total of 7,250 stones arrived in the two markets.</p>
<p>Edible oil has continued to rise. Yesterday, because the silver market was still loose, people were quite firm. Soybean oil opened at 285,000 and closed at 290,000, and it was impossible to buy it. It is estimated to have risen by 22,000. Rapeseed oil rose by 15,000 yuan. Jilong rapeseed oil was 380,000 yuan, an increase of 20,000. The closing was very firm. Soybean cake dealers were buying, an increase of 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour rose and then weakened. At the beginning, the prices of various goods outside the circle were high, and the factory supply was not large, so the owners strongly increased their prices. The old cars rose by more than 1,000 yuan, and the warship once reached a high of 23,100 yuan. In the middle, it was heard that the central bank was selling again, and the funds were reported to be small, and the market turned weak. The later market finally fell sharply. The old cars retreated to 23,800 yuan, and the warship was traded at 22,950 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse grains were still firm. The later market expected the silver market to tighten, and various goods were mostly reluctant to sell. Only soybeans were still popular due to the oil cake, and the factory sauce shops were all buying. The market trend continued to be firm, the supply of raw peanuts was extremely rare, and it rose again by 10,000 yuan. Yangzhou Tizhuang broke the 200,000 yuan mark. Sesame was firm, and corn rose first and then fell back.</p>

<p>The opening price is 10,000 yuan per catty.</p>
<p>It is understood that Mingqian New Longjing tea is made from the buds of tea plants that have just sprouted before the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar, which are picked and baked, and sold domestically in large quantities. It is heard that the new goods this year have been priced in Shanghai from the Wenzhou production area, but the amount is very small, only about 10 catties. After hearing the news, the tea shops in this city rushed to buy them. As a result, Dacheng Long, Ding Juntai, and Da Shanghai tea shops were the first to obtain them. The opening price is 10,000 yuan per catty.</p>
<p>According to people in the industry, although the market atmosphere is quite激昂, the quality aspect is not as good as previous years, because the weather is out of order, affecting the development of tea plants.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Heavy Pressure from Short Positions: Chinese Stocks Crash <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Chinese stock market was firm first and then weak yesterday. Because the central bank sold gold and yarn, starting a killing spree, the domestic short positions were strong, and the market turned from rising to falling.</p>
<p>At first, it was heard that the overnight differences by the banks were huge, and the silver market was loose, which caused a buying spree. After the opening of the market, all stocks showed an uptrend. Later, the news of gold and yarn sales spread, and people were panicked. The market was full of sell orders, and the market crashed.</p>
<p>Yongsheng Yarn opened at 7.8 jiao. Outside the market, there were offers as high as 7.9 jiao. The feeling of the winter market was strong, and the banks were absorbing the stock. It rose to 7.92 jiao, and then continued to be firm, with a very good trend, continuing to reach a peak of 7.98 jiao.</p>
<p>After 10 o'clock, the news of gold sales spread, and the four-way storm rose. The gold gang, the banking gang, and the securities gang all sold off. The market suddenly weakened and fell to 7.55 jiao. The major players in the middle raised the price again and rose to 7.73 jiao.</p>
<p>After 11 o'clock, the Textile Construction Company sold cotton yarn again. The yarn gang all came to sell, and the decline was even more violent. Until the close of the market, because of the prosperity of the short positions, the trading desk had no strength to struggle, and the afternoon closed at a low price of 7.22 jiao, which was 6 fen lower than the previous day's afternoon close.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks all rose at the beginning, and eventually turned weak. Xinguang fell from a peak of 8.7 jiao to 7.75 jiao at the noon close. Meiya fell from 2.5 yuan to 2.16 yuan.

<p>Since the transit transportation of tung oil has evolved, the market yesterday was still like a prairie fire, spreading repeatedly. Considering the abundance of positions in the industry, the repeated breaking of records for items outside the industry, and the adjustments in public utilities, the holders felt that the cost was forced to increase, and the offer price soared. The increase still reached more than 10,000 yuan, but the actual sales were still unchanged. Transactions were still very sluggish due to only inter-industry transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Huili Rides on Victory: Again Defeats Formidable Shanghai Police; Encas Loses to Pfeiffer by One Point <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In the basketball league last night, in the two games of the A Division, Huili defeated Shanghai Police by 48 to 30, and Pfeiffer defeated Encas by 40 to 39. The winners of the first round have all become losers. In A Division 2B, Wuming defeated Hezhong by 36 to 32. Around 2,000 spectators were present and were very excited.</p>
<p>Huili has made considerable progress in recent games. They have effectively controlled the ball under the basket, and their shooting has also been exceptionally smooth. Last night's performance made the audience even more satisfied. Tian Fuhai's shooting and Wei Xu's presence under the basket were both quite fascinating. Shanghai Police seemed to be in trouble in the first half, and were even more powerless in the second half.</p>
<p>Huili's five players against Shanghai Police were Wei Xu, Tian Fuhai, Ye Yunshan, Wang Yongfang, and Cao Zhiji. The opponent responded with five young players: Shi Jiuquan, Wang Rongsheng, He Zeng, Wang Bowen, and Chuan Qixia. After the start of the game, He Zeng made special contributions on the edge. Huili Wei Xu responded with a goal, 9 to 4, and Huili's momentum was strong, leading 3 to 2. Lao Cao and Tian Wang scored a goal each, 9 to 4, and Huili's momentum was strong. Shanghai Police Yongbiao and Jiuquan were still surrounded on all sides. Huili continued to score with free throws, and soon increased to 14 points, while the opponent only had four points. Bowen, who had a reputation for accurate shooting, was also making sporadic moves there. After 18 to 4, Shanghai Police Yongbiao and Qixia found a few openings and added some energy. However, Huili Tian Wei and others were easy to get, and Shanghai Police was discouraged in the first half with a score of 26 to 17.</p>
<p>In the second half, Shanghai Police's lineup was Bowen, Jiuquan, He Zeng, Yongbiao, and Jin Gui. Huili remained unchanged. Bowen started the second half's record. Tian Fuhai's "Blessings as vast as the East Sea" single-handedly turned in, plus a free throw, adding vitality. Huili had a "red and purple" situation. Cao Zhiji's dribbling and rolling was another proud masterpiece. Shanghai Police seemed to be at the end of their strength. When the score was 40 to 22, the difference was already 18 points. Unexpectedly, Jin Gui scored three consecutive goals, and Bowen added color, completing eight points in one go, and hope was not lost. However, with only five minutes remaining, Rongsheng committed five fouls, and Liang replaced him. With the main player leaving, Shanghai Police became even more miserable. At 48 to 30, Huili avenged the first loss.</p>

<p>In A Division 2B, Wuming defeated Hezhong, with a score of 36 to 32. Yan Shuangling of Wuming and Xiong Yuanzhong of Hezhong both excelled. Hezhong scored the first goal. Afterwards, Wuming scored eleven consecutive points, and soon the score was 21 to 6. The score was 22 to 14 in the first half. In the second half, Hezhong's Li Zhenbang and Xiong Yuanzhong made every effort to counterattack and the team was completely different. The score was once 30 to 28, only one goal behind. Wuming's Zhong Xinshun made a final effort, and finally won by a small margin of 36 to 32.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Encas Protests One Point Loss: Pfeiffer Pleasantly Surprised <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>In the first game of Division A, Encas played Pfeiffer again. In the last game, Pfeiffer's Keller and Parks each scored a goal. Encas's Barto scored a basket and scored nine consecutive points. The teams went back and forth. In the first half, Pfeiffer was in a good mood, winning by two points with a score of 23 to 21. Soon afterwards, the score was tied at 26. Encas's Kejie, Mi Luo Fuxu, and Ao Chai Liao were out, and the score was confusing again. At the same time, everyone was guarding closely. Encas's guest player Barto (originally from the Meteorological Team) performed very well, with a natural shooting posture. In the last moment, Encas was still leading by one point. Unexpectedly, Pfeiffer broke through and Graych scored a goal, 40 to 39, causing Encas to protest endlessly. In the first round, Encas won by a large margin of 42 to 26. Last night's result was unexpected.</p>

<p>Shanghai College has always emphasized sports. Every spring, it holds a sports meet to increase students' interest in physical education and select athletes for the intercollegiate games. This spring's sports meet is scheduled for Saturday, the 26th. Preparations are complete, and both male and female athletes are fully prepared. If the weather permits, there will be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>In addition, since the school launched a fundraising campaign last year to build the Zhanen Library, it has received more than its original target through the efforts of alumni, faculty, and students. Construction began last summer simultaneously with the new women's dormitory (named Fuzhe Hall), and it has now been completed first. A dedication ceremony is scheduled for 10 a.m. on the morning of the spring sports meet. However, to economize during this period, only invited friends, school board members, alumni representatives, and other friends will participate. The ceremony will be extremely simple and solemn to align with the principle of frugality.</p>

<p>The final of the Democracy Cup intermediate group football match between Yingguang and Daxia was kicked off on time yesterday in the South City. A few minutes into the game, Chen Yifei of Daxia scored the first goal. In the last minute of the second half, Tang Wenhong of Yingguang equalized. Therefore, the game was extended for 20 minutes, but the result was still a 1-1 draw. Due to time constraints, both parties agreed to share the trophy equally and not replay the match. However, this decision meant that the runner-up could not be determined. To comply with the resolutions of the representatives of each team and to provide more opportunities for observation and learning, in addition to promoting these two teams to the senior group, the winner of the consolation match will also be promoted to the senior group. The schedule for the first week will be announced tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e125">British Footballer Transfers for a Hefty Price of Tens of Thousands of Pounds <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The story of transfers is an unavoidable phenomenon in the football world around the globe. However, the most surprising part for the fans must be in Britain, where it originated. According to local football league regulations: After June 36th each year, the registration of players for all teams is subject to strict restrictions. Simply put: Will the General Association accept it? Everything must be decided by the General Association. For this reason, before the start of each football season, especially the week before March 16th, the football world invisibly becomes a stunning market, and the transfer activity attracts much attention. From the current observation: The huge wave brewing this season is a rare record in football history. What will be the final price figure on the last day (June 1st)? No one can predict that. But according to the observation of authoritative circles, the highest figure may exceed the original record by thousands of pounds, which is undeniable. Based on the fluctuating situation: Since the start of poaching this season, there have been 30 transfers, and the price has reached five figures (Note: that is, tens of thousands). Among them, the one recognized as setting a world record is the "Derby County" team's purchase of "Zunni Morris" from the "Manchester United" team for £24,000. In addition, those exceeding £20,000 include "Eddie Kilsu" transferring from the "Bili Team" to the "Sheffield Team"; and "George Robado" transferring from the "Binsley Team" to the "New Wann Ziai Team."</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned forwards with high transfer prices, there are also many others whose prices are around £18,000. Their names are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Anti Chang Nuo Shen" transferred from "Newcastle United" to "Fudu Bull Green," (2) "Anti Dang Nuo Shen" transferred from "Newcastle United" to "Sunderland," (salt) "Johnny Duoli" transferred from "Bailan Ford Team" to "Manchester United." In addition, the highest price for a center-back transfer also reached £17,500. The transfer was Welsh international player "Aihua Baohua Lu," who transferred from Queen's Pkar Ranger to "Aston Weixun Na"; the next highest was "Bailan Ford Team"'s captain and center-back "Ji Zhismos," who transferred to "Sheffield United" for £16,000; after that was "Birmingham Team"'s "Falan Mikecao," Birmingham gave the legendary center-back to "Dong Li Shi Team" for £15,000.</p>
<p>Speaking of defenders' transfers, the price is also quite surprising. Among them, the current record high is "Yi Yang Si Yaxian," an A Xiao Lan international player, who transferred from "Ci Lu Hua Shi Dong Te Team" to "Lutun City Team" for £10,000.</p>
<p>In summary, in this season's transfer market, the "Birmingham Team" is the most active. It spent a total of £58,000 to purchase six new players; conversely, it also earned considerable profits by letting go of three well-known players. In addition, the team that paid the highest price for transfer activities was the "Newcastle United Team," with a figure of £50,000; however, the profits from letting go of many players offset the cost. Secondly, the team that paid the highest price was the "Aston Wess" team, totaling £44,000.</p>

<p>(1) The fourth Mayor's Cup Basketball Championship will be divided into men's and women's groups and will still be co-organized with the Municipal Gymnasium. (2) Teams participating in the men's group must have the same level of skill as Group A1, but those in Group A2 with particularly strong strength may also apply to join, but must pass the review. (3) Group A2 will not be set up separately due to the league ranking elimination round, which does not allow time. (4) The men's group will adopt the method of the 7th National Games. The elimination round will be held first, and finally, a single round-robin system will be adopted to produce the top four. Those who are eliminated in the preliminary round will hold a consolation round using the elimination system to determine the consolation championship.

<p>[Reuters Paris, 23rd] The International Football Association Referee Committee met here today and reached new resolutions on several football rules as follows:</p>
<p>Players can be sent off for fighting on the field, and then a coin is tossed at the location where the ball stopped to determine which side kicks off.</p>
<p>After the kickoff, players must report to the referee when the ball is in the field or when they re-enter.</p>
<p>Obstruction shall only be penalized when the obstructed person is not carrying the ball or intending to grab the ball.</p>
<p>The Fourth Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament is scheduled to open on April 11th.</p>
<p>Each side must have at least seven and no more than eleven players when playing.</p>
<p>Another Scottish suggestion: changing the penalty area in front of the goal from the existing rectangle to a semicircle, and that there must be three instead of two people behind the ball to be considered offside, will be discussed at the next meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Praising Honest Officials <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Qiqu</p>
<p>Recently, I read an article in a certain newspaper titled "Anecdotes of Honest Officials," which aroused infinite emotion.</p>
<p>The honest official mentioned refers to Mr. Jiang Shuge, the former director of the National Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. It is said that since this gentleman resigned from his official position and came to Shanghai when Sun Ke was the head of the Executive Yuan, he has been living in a humble inn, extremely poor. The business community in Shanghai is currently planning to help him make a living. I have never met this gentleman, and I heard his name for the first time, so there is no reason for me to promote him. However, if what the newspaper says is true, I think I have reason to promote him from the standpoint of an ordinary citizen.</p>
<p>In the minds of a group of people—especially young people—the words "honest official" have long become a historical term. Indeed, we hear and see too much news, talk, and behavior about corruption every day, which inevitably makes people feel that "all officials are corrupt, and no official is not greedy." In fact, there are often fragrant grasses within ten steps, let alone such a large government, it cannot be generalized. As far as I know, in the tax department alone, there have been two good officials who were absolutely honest. One was Director Li of the Luoyang Direct Tax Bureau, who died in office in the middle of the Anti-Japanese War. After his death, his inheritance was only more than 20 yuan in legal tender, which was enough to buy a foot of white cloth at the market price at that time. Later, everyone donated money for his burial; the other was the Director of the Guiyang Tax Bureau, who died at the end of the Anti-Japanese War. After his death, he was desolate and had no means to make arrangements, which was reported in the newspapers of the accompanying capital. When they were alive, who would believe that tax officials would have no money? Even if they dressed poorly, people would think that they were like Mr. Ma Er, pretending to be poor! But can people pretend, even to death, or even after death?</p>
<p>In the current government agencies in Shanghai, as far as I know, there are also many honest people. Because they are currently in office, I will not mention their names to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>If we criticize corrupt elements with words and pens and think that they must be thoroughly purged, but only respond to honest people with a sigh, it is not only unfair, but also inappropriate, and it is also useless. Because today's corruption is due to the defects of economic, social, and political systems, and the deterioration of the atmosphere is obviously also an important factor. Some young people who scold corruption today will become experts in corruption when they enter society tomorrow. What is the reason for this? The social atmosphere is rewarding corruption and cultivating corruption.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that to eliminate corruption, it is better to praise honest officials effectively than to shout "kill" loudly. Praising honest officials is directly comforting good people and indirectly attacking bad people in a social sense; in an educational sense, it is praising goodness and setting an example for young people.</p>
<p>Of course, if our economic, political, and social systems are thoroughly and reasonably reformed so that honest officials can get more powerful and legitimate protection, it would be best; otherwise, if we listen to those who privately embezzle public funds and use their powers to intercede for their concubines, and let honest and public-spirited people be impoverished and neglected, I dare say that the consequences will be even more unimaginable.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Re-evaluating "Spring Thunder" <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ce</p>
<p>On the surface, "Spring Thunder" is a "romantic" and "charming" film, but at its core, it is a film with toxins and problems.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the theme of "Spring Thunder." If the playwright emphasized the so-called "educating the second generation," in "Spring Thunder," Li Hanfen's beautiful and moving sermon is only to advocate for feudal society and to persuade Shen Manli for her husband's personal reproduction.</p>
<p>After Li Hanfen heard that her husband had died at sea, she did not hesitate to divide half of her family property, and she did not hesitate to condescend and endure humiliation to Shen Manli. In summary, she only wanted to leave this lineage and descendants for her rumored missing husband; such a narrow and selfish feudal concept's poison can still be spread publicly today, which is truly surprising. And the playwright uses the sugar coating of "educating the second generation" to cover up this unhealthy bacterium, and we are truly worried about today's Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of character personalities, the playwright and director were completely unable to control it. Especially the role of Shen Manli, it is not clear what kind of person she is in terms of personality depiction. She seduced Pan Shuming's wound in public, even a prostitute should have some scruples; if she is a "socialite" and "social butterfly," after having physical relations with Pan Shuming, she is as pure as a saint, expressing that she does not want to accept any money from Pan Shuming. If Shen Manli is truly in love with Pan Shuming, but we see that the two are completely strangers before boarding the plane, it is not as "love at first sight" at all.</p>
<p>Finally, let's take a look at the situation of "Spring Thunder"'s blueprint, the enemy-puppet film "Competing for Spring."</p>
<p>"Competing for Spring" is a film produced during the enemy-puppet era. We cannot but admit that under the supervision of the enemy and puppets, they were a terrible bacterial team that spread poison and anesthetized the people. "Competing for Spring" should be banned, so what should be done with "Spring Thunder," which takes the story of "Competing for Spring" and is still full of anesthesia?</p>
<h3 id="e133">Ancient Art Exhibition Room <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>In Peru, South America, near the ancient city of Nazca, American scientist Professor Paul Kosok recently discovered the world's largest art exhibition room.</p>
<p>This ancient giant art exhibition room is a 200-square-mile open-air sand desert, covered with huge statues of birds, spiders, plants, and multi-headed snakes. It is also the largest of the known astronomical charts. Countless straight lines and geometric figures drawn according to precise mathematics mark the movement of the sun, many of which are marked by rows of round pebbles embedded in the sand, which are not easily visible from the ground. Professor Kosok discovered this great achievement of the already vanished culture through aerial photography. The American Museum of Natural History estimates that these figures are about two thousand years old. Professor Kosok believes that some of those lines represent the movement of the stars. The secrets of many huge paintings remain unsolved to this day. The spider's figure clearly shows the various parts of the spider's body and its eight legs. The eagle's statue has a beak, claws, and tail, with its wings spread out, reaching 150 yards in length. Are they the totems of tribal nations? Are they religious symbols? Or are they trying to signal to the sun or the stars? These are all unsolved mysteries, waiting for modern scientists to conduct further exploration and research.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Ode to a Strange Disease <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Song Zhuang Jiyu's "Chicken Rib Chapter" says: "Xu, the wife of Meng Yu, the Participating Political Affairs Officer, had a strange disease. Every time it occurred upon hearing or seeing something, her whole body would tremble to the point of almost dying... She also hated hearing the surname Xu and the sound of silver and iron being struck. She could not bear to see any leftover money when buying things, nor did she want to keep a single penny. She once had a maid who had served her for more than ten years and was very capable, and she liked her very much. One day, she accidentally heard what the maid's family did for a living, and the maid said, 'Striking silver.' The disease also occurred, and she could no longer see her, and eventually drove her away..."</p>
<p>This kind of problem is indeed a strange disease. It is also strange for a woman to hate hearing her mother's surname. As for silver and iron, these two things are really hateful. If there were no iron in the world, wars would never happen; even if they did, they would not be so cruel. As for silver, it is even more hateful. How many people in ancient and modern times have suffered greatly from it. The sound of striking silver and iron that the lady heard, in fact, should not only be called a strange disease, but also a virtue. If everyone in the world was afraid of hearing the sound of striking silver and iron, wouldn't the world be peaceful? Unfortunately, now people, especially those in high positions, are launching wars to compete for coal and iron resources; and ordinary people, "when foreign money rings, their eyes become clear." When black eyeballs see silver coins, they are all extremely happy. The more silver coins, the better. The big heads are the best, and the small heads are not bad either. They will never be like that lady who "does not want to keep a single penny." Even Du Fu still had to "keep a penny to see." Wang Yifu never spoke of money in his life, only calling it "A Du," but in fact, he was still talking about money. However, now there are real knives and guns everywhere, and silver coins ring all over the street. If that lady lived today, she would not be able to live for a day.</p>
<p>I pray to God that all the ladies in the world are afflicted with this "strange disease," then the gentlemen will definitely be willing to be honest and selfless and yield to the country, and the world will be peaceful from now on! Therefore, I wrote "Ode to a Strange Disease."</p>
<p>That Prime Minister's wife, Xu, hated hearing the surname Xu, which I felt inexplicable when I first wrote this article, but it is actually a virtue. Because it proves that she will never ask her lord to employ her older or younger brothers. I suspect that Zhuang Jiyu's article is a fable. If there really was such a strange disease in the Song Dynasty, then I really regret why this good disease that can govern the country and make the world peaceful has not been passed down to this day! - Postscript.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Art and Human Culture <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>— For the Art Festival</p>
<p>Grosse's "The Origins of Art" says that the inner impulses of mankind produce intuitive aesthetic effects; Reinach's "Apollo's Art History" says that art is the crystallization of human labor; the former focuses on the spiritual, and the latter focuses on the material. In short, the creation of works of art is nothing more than the result of human spiritual and material activities.</p>
<p>Since mankind has produced works of art, let us look back at what benefits works of art have for human life? In the beginning, the art of primitive peoples mostly used the birds and animals of the time as themes, which were used to decorate the body and weapons, to boast of their own bravery, and to exert the effectiveness of tools; on the one hand, they were placed in caves to pray for the victory of hunting, which is how they gradually placed works of art in daily life. The people of Egypt and Mesopotamia left behind many great tomb arts, because at that time those people believed in eternal life and valued life after death as a happy life, and those "pyramids" and "high towers" were their lifelong endeavors, and at the same time, they gave their spirits something to rely on. The temples of the Greek people, the palaces of the Roman people, and the church buildings of the Middle Ages were all things that everyone needed at that time. As for the beginning of modern culture, that is, the European Renaissance, the arts in all aspects, whether architecture, sculpture, painting, or crafts, were brilliant, and the entire Huanzhou, and even the human life of the world, became more and more prosperous because of the development of art, and all cultures suddenly leapt forward, science gradually developed, commerce gradually developed, and human life and enjoyment have added a lot of happiness. Therefore, the "Renaissance," an epoch-making movement, has made the general public still miss this beautiful century, which is so great!</p>
<p>Let's talk about our Chinese nation again. It is one of the oldest national cultures in the world, along with Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India, and now only our Chinese nation can be called independent and complete, and is still continuing to thrive, inheriting the culture of its ancestors and creating a new culture for the future. The works of art of our ancestors have been scattered in major art museums around the world and are worshipped by them. That is, the Paris School, the world art center, the so-called post-impressionism, fauvism, and the recent abstract expressionism, are nothing more than the result of absorbing the line beauty of our country's painting, and abstract expressionism is even more involved in the abstract nature of our country's freehand brushwork and calligraphy. As a result, a chip of Qin brick and a corner of Han tile are also regarded as treasures; the paintings of the Tang and Song Dynasties have become priceless on the international market, and their position is becoming more and more prominent.</p>
<p>Therefore, when it comes to how we should inherit the glorious legacy of our ancestors in the future? And how to create a new road for the art of New China? On today's Art Festival, all of us in the art world must deeply reflect and strictly review. Today, we are standing in the midst of the chaos of war, and the lives of the people are extremely difficult. Seeing that art has been devastated, to the point where it is about to be unable to survive, we must save this crisis, and its significance is even more profound. Because if we investigate why the country has become so troubled, the main reason is the severe conflict in culture. The inherent culture has declined to the extreme since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and it has never recovered. Moreover, it has been mixed with the uncoordinated destruction of Western culture, so that those who are engaged in cultural work each insist on their own views and reject each other. Those who are mild, criticize each other without cooperation; those who are fierce, resort to fighting and violence, ignoring the true value of inherent culture, and blindly importing unsuitable foreign cultures. In our art world, there are neither works that can surpass our predecessors, nor are there any works that have personality and represent the national Western art, so we are confused and do not know where to go. Learning from the past, we should, from now on, each writer be able to do his best to accept the elites of our country's art, and at the same time strive to absorb the strengths of Western art, concentrate our goals, and march in unison, then it will not be difficult to embark on a path of peace, unity, beauty, and brilliance.</p>
