<h3>政府今續縝密討論　可能要求延展數日　俾提修正案與中共磋商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕政府對中共所提八條廿四款之答覆，在十九日舉行竟日之重要會議中，商未獲得全部結論，定廿日繼續集會討論，作最後決定。十九日晨九時李代總統及何應欽院長在國防部召集和談指導委會，除由何氏作簡單說明外，並邀自平返京之代表黃紹竑報告和談接觸經過，顧問屈武則作補充說明，報告內容係包括：（一）四月一日抵平時開始至十二日之個別交換意見，及與包澤東數次晤面之談話記錄；（二）十三日·十五日兩次大會情況及詳細記錄；（三）中共提出條件及討論經過；（四）與第三方面人士之接觸清醒劑第三方面人士之意見；（五）中共重要人士之態度與做法。黃·屈兩氏之報考極為詳盡，歷三小時許始畢，旋卽休會。午後續舉行會議，當由何氏將中共之廿四條款提出討論，並由自溪口返京之居正，朱家驊，吳鐵城，分別就在溪口與蔣總統研究和平問題所獲之結論予以報告，至晚始散。午後會中係逐條討論者，故凡有認爲須重大變更之條款，均可統一，性質重大者，則未獲結論。記者曾於會後分訪與會人士，彼等均不透漏任何意見，所可知者，爲廿四條款中之普通各款並非不可商量，雖在時間上及做法上容有不容，但衆信在修正案向中共提出後，不致毫無考慮之餘也。至重要問題如渡江鄧，則尚待縝密研究，故該會勢將于廿日晨再度集會。本日出席會議者，有李宗仁，何應欽，于右任，童冠賢，張翠，居正，主機啊哈，吳忠信，徐永昌，吳鐵城·列席者有黃昭竑，屈武，黃少谷，黃雲邨，白崇禧，閻錫山，劉建羣鄧。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕政府對中共之答覆　，可能於廿日午夜以電達北平，且爲將和談經過情形昭示國人，現正考慮與答覆中共同時發表聲明，上述兩事，均將於廿日夜九時舉行之政務會議中作最後決定。李代總統十九日召開之和談知道委會，係黨內之決策，政院爲責任內閣，所有決定必須經財務會議通過。廿日上午將續開和談指導委會，下午因何應欽出席立院報告，故政院例會改於晚九時舉行，俾於限期之前獲得決定，轉知中共。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕赴溪口請示和談問題之居正，吳鐵城，朱家驊三氏，十八日返滬後，十九日晨九時許白滬飛京，下機後卽赴國防部，參加李代總統召集之和談指導委員會議。</p>
<h3>何院長今赴立院　作和談綜合報告　包括中共要求內容及政府對策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕立委要求了解和談進行情形及和平協定草案之內容，吳延環鄧四十八人於十九日院會中曾提出臨時動議，同時行政院長何應欽亦已決定，於廿日下午出席立院臨時會，就和談進行情況，中共要求內容及政府決定之對策作綜合之報告。吳延環鄧之動議，爲咨請政院於和談簽字前，將和平條款送交本院審議，各委員紛紛發言，多數認爲在明瞭和談經過及中共要求之前，應先請行政院長報告，且立院已授權政府進行和談，如在和談尚未決定前卽進行本案，在程序上顯有矛盾，然部份委員並不反對審議之舉，對請何院長報告及請委員紹竑出席交換意見，均無異議，最後決定請何院長列席本源報告後，再作決定</p>
<h3>童冠賢劉健羣　邀宴全體立委　報告知道委會經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕立法院長童冠賢，副院長劉健羣，十九日午十二時在國際聯歡社宴請全體立委，到二百餘人，童氏因參加和談知道委會會議，遲至一時始到，卽席簡略報告和談經過及十九日上午開會情形，並稱：自未開會討論，十九日始爲第一次正式會商，報載李代總統已致電中共，請求延期說不確。末稱：立院應在政府所在地支持政府，不論今後如何演變，政府五院當將共同行動，　　至下午二時始散。</p>
<h3>黃旭初返桂　李品仙自京抵漢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕桂主席黃旭初，奉李代總統召來京述職，事畢，十九日下午五時許，由京專機飛返桂，總統府第二局長黃雲邨夫人及立委程思遠夫人等均同機返桂。另悉，李代總統夫人郭德潔亦將於三數日內由京返桂。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十九日電〕李品仙十九日午自京飛抵漢，據稱，和談前途尚未至絕望階段。</p>
<h3>京要員眷屬　已紛紛他往</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京十九日電〕南京今日外表安定，未因中共期限之將屆而呈紛亂，各業照常進行，與三個月前共軍初抵長江北岸時之情形迥不相同。惟有力離京者，均已他往。李代總統若干顧問之家屬，亦於今日離京，惟火車運輸情形正常，飛機亦未加班。謠傳政府已開始遷往上海之說，尚不能證實。</p>
<h3>于右任昨表示　已無赴平必要</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕于右任赴平期，經再延緩後，十九日晚于氏對記者表示，渠已無赴平之必要。</p>
<h3>和談波折意中事　雖屆限期尚不致即破裂</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕廿日爲共方要求政府簽訂和平協定之期，政府態度如何，至遲須於廿日午夜以前作一決定，俾儘速通知在平之政府代表團，轉達中共。權威人士十九日晚透露，政府決定，將爲下述兩點：第一，於廿日午後以前致電政府代表轉告中共，說明種種實際上之困難，請將簽字日期延展（可能延展五天改廿五簽字）。第二，在延展旗艦，由政府提出修正意見，俾與中共從容磋商。該人士並稱：和平協定之簽訂，關係至鉅，政府方面必須縝密商討，統一黨內各方意見，則此和平協定始能具有整個性，中共條款中之最困難部份，政府方面之意見爲俟聯合政府成立後，一切由聯合政府決定。聯合政府中各方所佔比例，應有詳盡規定，國民黨當由其應有之地位。至渡江及改編軍隊等問題，可留待聯合政府設法解決，不必於此兵戎將停未停之際提出，以免發生枝節問題，如政府之修正意見能獲得中共考慮採納，則和談前途尚大有可焉。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕權威觀察家十九日晚談稱：廿日雖未中共限定和平協定簽字之日期，但此並非如不能簽字，共軍卽將渡江之謂。該觀察家認爲：共軍是否渡江，須視其實力如何，如和談尚未完全結束，共軍卽　然渡江，政府軍必予抵抗，屆時共軍能否能如其所願，尚成問題。現廿日已屆，和平協定之簽字將延期，不論政府提延期之請與否，或中國同意與否，亦必不致廿日未及簽字，共軍卽於廿一日渡江。況和談開始時，卽已預見困難重重，和談期間，必有若干波折，成功自非易事，亦不致一遇波折，卽告破裂也。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>美國還可觀望嗎？</h3>
<p>在美國朝對要求加緊援華聲派高漲中，國務卿艾契遜致康納萊議員的函件發表了，不管對主張援華的人士澆了一盆冷水，但也機器了參議員的憤慨，在參議院內充滿了譴責和指摘的言論，使國務院中人也不得不以「亞洲民族主義的高潮將使蘇聯不能空中中國」（各衆社華府十七日電）自嘲自解了。美國應否加緊援華？雖是美國自己的事情，在接受援助的國家本不便有所表示；但這個問題已不是一個單純的「是非」問題，而是有關整個世界和平的問題。我們不忍聽任艾契遜國務卿爲錯誤的情報所迷惑，引導美國步入歧途，再在遠東中國鑄成歷史的錯誤。所以，我們不能不撰文，糾正這個存在中美國之間的一個可怕的錯誤觀念。</p>
<p>艾氏致康納萊議員的　，是三月十五日發出的，因其意義重大，發表後足以削弱中國政府在和談中的低位，所以一直沒有公佈；但維持島民主黨參議院格林，卻要求將該函發表，因此便在四月十六日對外發表了。這封信的內容，說明了國務院對於麥卡蘭十五億美元援華議案的意見，全文由美國新聞處翻譯，上海各報均已刊載。</p>
<p>我們綜合該函的大意，可得下列幾點：（一）自大戰勝利後，美國已給予中國二十億美元以上的援助；但中國政府的經濟及軍事局勢依然惡化到如此的程度，在華南也無力抵抗中共的繼積南進。（二）中國政府軍隊的失敗，並非敗於彈藥及配備的缺乏，今後美國即便再予以軍事援助，也不能改變中國目前一切發展的狀態。（三）美國如若繼續援華，僅能延長中國的內戰，徒增中國人民的痛苦，其結果勢將加深中國人民的反美情緒。（四）美國如欲挽回中國政府目前惡化的局勢，必需運用大批武裝部隊實際作戰，而這種行動實違反美國的傳統對華政策及其本國的利益。因此，艾契遜便作一結論，他說：「國務院的意見認爲，這個議案所建議的援華，不問其範圍及其性質，均不是中國目前的環境所能保證的。」但是艾氏深恐這種過分消極的對華政策，會引起輿情的不滿，又在結論的後面，開了一個小小的「方便之門」。他說：「政府已考慮請求國會延長一九四八年援華法案的期限，以便在一九四九廿四月二日該法案終止後的一定時期內，撥發尚未支付的剩餘援款（約五千四百萬美元）。如果在這個時期內，中國局勢能獲得澄清，則可能提出更進一步的建議。」這封信充分暴露出美國對華政策的矛盾，艾契遜對於中國局勢，至今猶抱著觀望態度，一方面爲錯誤的情報所迷惑，認爲繼續援華無補實際，徒然加深中國人民的反美精神；另一方面又恐怕輿情的指摘，仍將「援華之門」，開著不關閉。這種優柔寡斷，患得患失，躊躇不前的態度，不要說中國人民看了要表示無限的感慨，就是美國人民也要表示深惡痛絕的。所以，子啊參議院內充滿了一片反對艾契遜的呼聲，共和黨議員勃里奇要求國會澈查國務院的對華政策；原提案人麥卡蘭指斥艾氏向國會提出錯誤及不實之情報，不管對中共示弱。紐約泰晤士報業認爲政府對於於中國問題不能遲疑不決。艾契遜雖未直接答覆，但其左右的人士則已爲其辯護，「及時中共在內戰中獲得完全勝利，但亞洲民族主義仍將阻止蘇聯控制中國。故一俟內戰結束，中國必將一切外來勢力摒除於門外，政府對華所以採取「袖手旁觀」的政策，其故即在此。」這種聊以自解自嘲的說法，徒見其請詞奪理而已。我們祗要提出下面兩個問題，艾契遜就無法答覆了。</p>
<p>第一，戰後美國的對外政策，一直以「杜魯門主義」和「馬歇爾計劃」爲其基調的，一言以蔽之，乃在「防共反蘇」四個大字。過去因盼於蘇聯妥協，合力締造和平，尚不顧作露骨的表示；但至今日，大西洋公約已簽字，包圍蘇聯的形勢也已形成，甚至杜魯門總統警告各國說：美國爲了世界和平，不惜使用原子彈，美國在歐洲，如此反共，這般反蘇；但在遠東，艾契遜對於反共最烈的中國政府，卻另眼相看，採取觀望態度，艾契遜究將如何自圓其說呢？史泰遜說：「對亞洲未克實行馬歇爾計劃，實爲吾人最悲慘之失敗。」艾契遜聽了不知作何感想？</p>
<p>第二，美國本有不少人對於中國存著許多幻想，認爲中國並無國際性，不過是一種主張土地改革的政黨而已；甚至還有人以爲毛澤東可以做中國的狄托，不受莫斯科的支配。過去抱著這種幻想，尚有理由可說；但至今日，仍以此自解自嘲，豈非盲目的外交家？到今日還沒有看到毛澤東反對大西洋公約的通電嗎？還沒有聽到毛澤東的八項條件之一－－取消一切賣國條約（中美貿易條約，中美互相協定，中美救濟協定曁一九四七年的中美協定）嗎？辦理外交，如不正規現實，無異於盲人瞎騎馬，豈不要闖出滔天大禍來！</p>
<p>要之，中國局勢將急轉直下，遠東所受共產勢力的威脅益見嚴重，美國還可抱著觀望態度嗎？前國務卿馬歇爾已自認錯誤而去職，艾契遜國務卿豈可再蹈覆轍！共產勢力刻正向世界的「真空地帶」——亞洲發展，中共的成功，九時共產勢力控制珍整個亞洲的開始，艾契遜豈可一味逃避現實，而仍採取「觀望」態度？參議院的指摘固不足憂，但是歷史家的批判是殘酷的，是不能不重視的。</p>

<h3>西方堅持解除柏林封鎖　四強談判門戶洞開　建立西德政府計劃不放棄　蘇專使銜命赴美業經證實</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十九日電〕外交界十九日稱：西方已拒蘇聯關於終止柏林封鎖之試探，但仍敞開更行談判之門戶。黨通方面稱，蘇聯代表會被鄭重告知，西方可接受：（一）同時終止蘇聯之封鎖柏林及盟方之反對。（二）在封鎖解除後舉行四強外長會議，討論整個德國問題。但據稱，西方會表示，不顧蘇聯之反對，建立西德政府之計劃仍將繼續進行。東西間關於柏林問題之談判，傳經由聯合國蘇代表馬立克而進行者。聞馬氏最初曾建議，西方中止其設立西德政府之計劃，以換得封鎖之解除。馬氏暗示此點將導成討論德國問題之外長會議。此間外交界稱，蘇聯此議係提交　當時在華府集會之西方三強外長，艾契遜·具文·及許曼三氏曾討論蘇聯此一試探。彼等顯曾決定不能接受欲使彼等放棄西德計劃值任何建議，但彼等願再集議。答覆之交予馬立克，與馬氏當初提出此議時係同標非正式者。外交界幷謂，次一行動現需由蘇聯方面決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林十八日電〕與蘇軍總部接近之德國可靠方面報告稱，蘇官員一人已於昨日徵服離柏林前往華盛頓，對該地蘇大使館傳遞某種重要使命。據云，該人並將在美獲取關於大西洋公約的詳確情報，及其對於西歐尤其是西德的後果。該使者與另一蘇人同行，姓名雖未宣佈，但相信渠乃蘇財政專家共黨政治局之親信馬里甯將軍。馬氏爲索科洛夫斯基實施柏林封鎖時之財政顧問，但馬氏此去，並部以柏林封鎖爲主要討論題目。蘇軍政府人士不願透露該使者是否將美國務卿艾契遜解除。據悉，馬里甯離柏林前，會與蘇駐德軍事總督邱柯夫將軍及其政治顧問謝米諾夫詳談。另悉，另一蘇聯德國問題專家戰前蘇聯末任駐德大使狄卡諾柯夫於復活節時亦在柏林。按馬里甯常隨前蘇軍總督索帥出席西強盟管會議。馬氏化名甚多，喬其埃夫爲其化名之一。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕外交界方面稱，德國東西港口間所存無幾之貿易關係，可能成為蘇聯提議終止柏林封鎖之路徑。蘇聯如能進行一二次試運，通過反對封鎖綫而成功，結果或可使雙方逐漸放寬限制，而毋需經過任何「正式」協議。美國迄今所荷空運費用之巨，將使國會及納稅人均樂於結束，但如讓柏林完全落入蘇聯掌握，則毋甯繼續空運。</p>

<h3>中泰遜重申「麥帥計劃」　籲請美廣泛援亞　撥款十億元支持華南與整個亞洲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社費城十八日電〕共和黨上屆總統候選人卽　　　凡尼亞大學校史泰遜今日致函費城晚報，重申擬訂「麥克阿宓援亞計劃」之主張，俾與馬歇爾援歐計劃並行。史氏宣稱，本月一日余在波士頓發表之演說引起許多人士誤解，茲有補充闡明之必要。余並非要求單獨援助中國，而係要求統盤援助亞洲。</p>
<p>美國政府戰後在亞洲之行動違反全世界大多數公正學者之判斷與忠告。前國務院長馬歇爾擬訂之援歐復興計劃，雖爲戰後吾人最重要之作焉，但對亞洲未克實行同樣基本辦法，則爲吾人最悲慘之失敗。亞洲與歐洲不同，不能视作直接對象處理，故余建議借用偉大英雄之令名，稱之爲「麥克亞瑟計劃」，象徵美國將對世界比一廣大部份許多民族與土地展開進一步援助。依照該項計劃，美國應每年撥款十億元，以支持華南與整個亞洲，阻遏共產主義。爲取消有利於共產黨統治中國之援助計，此舉實屬必要。美國務院須立卽採取行動，支持華南。新計劃不僅援助日本，中國或緬甸，而係泛亞洲性質。援助方式有下列數端，卽改善中國與緬甸之交通，發展印度內河水電工程，及促成菲律賓與日本之復興。此外，並應規定亞洲各國間之貿易方法。美國現對亞洲「毫無政策與計劃」，政府應早日擬訂此種計劃，並交予熟悉亞洲局勢者辦理。</p>

<h3>財長劉攻蕓出席報告　新財金改革方案內容</h3>
<p>昨日當經濟會報舉行之前，首由陳秘書長邀請財政部長劉攻蕓報告中央此次修正通過之新財政金融改革方案內容，略稱：財政金融改革方案，經根據何院長施政方針予以修正，送立法院經修正通過，其內容較重要者爲：（一）原案中規定關元必須以黃金外匯向央行購買，經改爲可以金圓券購買。（二）貨物稅仍不以實物徵收。（三）鹽稅徵實制度，暫緩辦理。（四）直接稅所利得稅採取分配制度。（五）舉辦財產稅。（六）貨物稅仍不以數計算，逾期不繳者，罰金以保值爲原則，辦法請央行另訂。（七）維持工商業儘予結匯便利，舉辦定貨貸款及保值存款。（八）舉辦保值存款及保值保險。（九）貿易方面限制進口，立法院所提出之黃金白銀進口免稅問題，財政部正在考慮中。保值存款已積極籌辦，保值保險將與保險業會商後擬訂。關稅制度刻正由直接稅局等漏夜擬訂實施辦法公佈實施之。</p>
<p>劉氏對本市物價狂漲清醒，加以分析，略謂：政府實施銀元發餉後，使政府支出突告增加，致影響物價上漲，惟本人敢保證整個經濟不致陷於崩潰，因政府迄未使用實力，現尚有充分力量足以應變。吾等應以絕大信心實施新財政金融改革方案。凡擾亂金融者決予嚴懲，盼各界共同襄助，渡此難關。</p>
<h3>湯總司令三點意見</h3>
<p>劉部長詞畢，由湯總司令發表數點意見如下：（一）新財政金融方案，係根據實際情形需要修正訂定者，希望各界一致擁護看，共同解決當前經濟難題。央行之拋售金銀外幣，不能解決問題，應著重於鼓勵生產，使貨物運銷暢通，俾工商業得以維持，並應大量購儲日用必需品。（二）工人生活應予確切保障。（三）現時鄉村居戶均以食米爲交易單位，本市似亦可以實物或銀元爲計價單位，可協助安定金融。</p>
<h3>鈔荒可不再發生</h3>
<p>對於總工會及工業會所提之以銀元爲通貨銀元買賣，鈔荒，票據抵用等問題，劉部長之解答爲（一）銀元不能作爲貨幣，惟准其自由買賣者，因銀元與金圓同時流通後，對金圓之打擊太大。又軍隊副食費改發銀元後，當須准其自由買賣。至于將來是否將採銀本位問題，現財政部正考慮政府之實力，將等待時機再作決定。（二）銀元買賣本可由央行逐日掛牌，現需考慮者，亦爲實力問題，因政府尚無足夠銀元也。（三）鈔荒之形成，由於央行來不及印製大鈔而發生脫節現象，現經日夜趕印，保證今後可不再發生此種情形。（四）票據能否當日抵用，乃技術問題，加以研究後，必可改善云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕邇來物價漲勢驚人，本市水電煤氣電話及公用交通機構，均深受影響，瀕陷絕境，紛向主管當局要求迅予改善收費辦法，以應付一日數變之物價。據上海自來水公司方面統計，自三月五日至四月五日止，該公司依發出帳單所列收入依照各該發出日外匯率計算，均可想相等於七萬七千餘英鎊至幣值，迨依款項收到時外匯率折算，僅合四萬七千餘鎊公司方面受收款遲緩之損失，實屬不貲，其他各公司亦復相同，上　　力公司及法商水電公司等，每月受幣制貶值，虧損約在總收入半數以上。煤氣公司以經常保留一個月以上之存煤，，目下因無力補充，僅剩七天存量。至交通部份，市公共汽車，每日全部首日，尚不敷汽油一項支出，目下存油，不足半月之用，個公司面臨絕大難關，僉以爲非改善收費辦法，實有陷於完全停頓之處，環請迅卽予以補救。主管當局以公共事業關係本市工業生產曁社會安定，至深且鉅，對各公司所提要求，正要縝密研討對策中云。</p>

<h3>物價上漲如癡如狂　蔬菜魚肉騰踴最烈　春季時裝實銷銳減　大公司內多用銀元折價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近週來各物漲風，如癡如狂，一般薪水階級已至無法支持階段。據某研究物價之學術團體調查報告：近半月中各物上漲速度以蔬菜魚肉類最烈，平均較八一九時高出十萬倍以上。其次則爲豆油，再次爲米糧，金鈔袁頭上漲率實際尚不及物價。因物價變動過速，目前市面上又重見過去法幣急劇貶值時之情景，上下午時價不同，各區內售價互異，如油條一根在中區定價三千元，但南市一帶有高至六千元者。普通市民購買力因日趨薄弱，各商店實銷亦呆滯不堪，過去每屆春季營業鼎盛之時裝店，今年實銷約激減十分之六七，故門庭異常慘淡。至較大值公司內，買賣雙方均已默契以銀元折價，各公司亦多添用退休多年之老式帳房，專事鑒別顧客交付之銀元，廿年前交易方式重呈目前，實令人感觸萬端。</p>

<h3>美援物資食米　第三百次運到　海宿輸上舉行儀式　接受美方誠摯友誼</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第三百次美援物資食米九千零五十長噸，由招商局海宿輸裝運，於前日抵滬，停泊招商局第一碼頭。昨晨十日在輸上舉行接受儀式，由美援運用委員會委員張肇元主持，到經合分署副署長葛里芬，市政府秘書長陳良，糧食購儲會主席委員楊綽庵，美駐滬總領事葛博德及各機關代表等三十餘人。儀式開始後，首由張肇元氏致詞，略稱此次海宿輸運米來滬，係裝運美援物資來華之第三百艘輪船，值得紀念，對於美國人民與政府所給及我人之幫助甚爲感謝。截止目前爲止，援華物資運來我國價值已達一億五千萬美元，其中有食米九千餘長噸爲數雖不甚鉅，但對於充裕滬市民食配售及安定市民心理，效果殊宏。至於棉花之供給紗廠紡製，直接維持一百萬以上工人不致失業，而間接受益者爲數更多。汽油及其其他油料幫助交通及公共失業之維持與發展，肥料直接助我國農業之　產，煤則攻擊電廠及一般工廠急需之燃料，凡此種種物資之接濟，均有極大幫助。最近美參衆兩院通過美援撥款期限延長之法案，使本屆美援計劃所餘五千四百萬美援繼續配供我需要之物資及農村復興計劃之推行，深表欣慰，希望能以自助之精神接受美國人民與政府誠摯之友誼。張氏詞畢，繼由葛里芬致詞，闡述美國援華之意義，並希望中國和平成功，，使人民不再遭受內戰之痛苦，並稱杜魯門總統對於日戰爭勝利後，特派馬歇爾將軍來華努力促進中國政黨之協調，雖未成功，但美國盼望中國能早息干戈復興繁榮之初衷，始終不渝云。嗣由市府陳秘書長致詞，引用我國古諺語「錦上添花易，雪中送炭難。」比喻美國在我國艱困萬分之際，給予有效之援助。對於此種純潔而可貴之友誼，代表滬市六百萬市民深表感謝之意。儀式於十一時告成，旋舉行酒會，賓主盡歡而散。</p>

<h3>參會等團體聯電呼籲　盼共方放屁苛酷條件</h3>
<p>本市參議會，總工會，教育會，農會，婦女會等各團體，鑒於中共所提出之二十四條款庶多苛酷，有礙和談，各報館幷轉全國同胞，茲錄其原文如下：當茲政府赤誠謀和，全國人民渴望和平，　求弭戰之際，中共以二十四條款通知政府，限於二十日答覆，一面幷正調集部隊，食言停戰，猛攻江北國軍橋頭堡，積極作南渡之舉，實予全國矚目之下和談，不啻給與一當頭之棒擊。查中共所提廿四條款及其夫款殊多苛酷之處，如聯合政府之參加份子及其決策委員會主席委員，須由中共遴選，是則名爲聯合，實爲包辦。次如中華民國國體之須變更，法統須取消，其欲將吾國數千年傳統之光榮歷史以及文物制度之摧毀於一旦，當爲吾人所不取。此外中共逼令國軍按北平之方式改編，制定江陰·鎮江·蕪湖·安慶·九江等處爲和平渡江地點，並接收海空軍等，企圖兵不血刃而渡江，迫政府於投降。至沒收私人資本，更顯見中共絲毫不願放棄放棄鬥爭清算之暴力政策，良深遣憾。至盼中共能幡然覺悟，以民命爲重，以民意爲重，立即就地停止一切軍事行動，以覆前次諾言，並閒誠相見，維護人民生活之自由，協定雙方軍隊，能在平等條件下，各在防區自行整編，庶和談得以　續，全面合理合情之和平賴以實現，否則十手所指，十目所視，破壞和平之責任誰屬，故彰彰明甚。本會等憂國心切，在此和談已瀕千鈞一髮之時，不忍緘默，爰特聯名通電全國各團體各同胞共同奮起，一致呼籲，俾在吾全國真正公平之民意督促下，使雙方實施停戰，相忍相讓，挽和談於破裂，救國運於垂危，則國家幸甚，人民幸甚矣。</p>

<h3>兩路局節省煤斤　停駛非必要客車　回覆金陵錢塘號京杭連運車　行車列表亦將有重大變動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路局爲節省煤斤，便利旅客，將停駛若干次必要客車，而恢復金陵號·錢塘號京杭連運車，同時兩路行車時刻表亦將有重大變動，新行車時刻至昨日晚已完全排定，惟實施日期尚未決定，因須待京粵直達車行畢全程，交部連運處排定時刻，然後將此次客車時刻編入後，方可實施。茲將已決定增減車次及預定變動之行車時刻探錄如次：</p>
<p>（一）停駛：京滬綫第八十五次，八十六次，八十七次，八十八次京鎮區間車。七十八次，七十九次錫滬區間車。八十一次，八十二次常滬區間車。第十七次，十八次京滬特快車。滬杭綫第二十七次，二十八次滬杭夜車。</p>

<h3>全滬漁輸漁船　大部出港捕撈</h3>
<p>在此黃花魚汛旺盛時期，警備部爲顧及江防安全，幷體念漁民魚商生計起見，特將漁船編組登記，出港捕販，此項登記手續，幷規定儘量採取迅速與便利，以不耽誤魚汛爲原則。茲悉：上海市漁會爲遵照警備部指示，經江全滬漁輸漁船，漁管處，海產運銷會，蘇北七縣漁聯會等四處負責趕辦，現在大部已經出港捕販。再各報前載福山·滸浦兩港開放事，據悉係屬誤傳，該處漁船已經掃數移駛瀏河口，就近出海捕撈，以便檢查。</p>
<h3>向犯人家屬詐財　王金明判刑死刑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕無業遊民王金明，今年一，二月間一名張國華者勾結，以能設法保　羈押於地院第一看守所之人犯蘇友富，陸根生等爲詞，連續向犯人家屬蘇馮桂英，陸阿四，陳楊愛蘭，劉曉亞，吳小妹，黃賬杏賓等十餘人騙取活動費用及衣物甚夥，及至二月廿八日中午十二時許在東長治路被劉曉亞撞見，乃卽批報黃浦豢分局，經偵查起訴，昨經地院審結，庭上以王雖因謀生乏術，出此下策，但其對象卻爲犯人家屬，若輩因夫兄子弟身繫縲絏，亟望恢復自由，故對被告百般依順，任其予取予求，而被告卻專在若輩可憐蟲身上施行詐欺，實屬可惡，故情雖可憫，心實可誅，著判處有期徒刑四年示儆。</p>
<h3>京粵直達通車　昨進入折幹路　正式通車困難尚多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京粵直達車已順利行畢京滬·滬杭兩路，昨日進入浙贛路，過南昌並準點到達樟樹鎮，旅客渡贛江，換粵漢路車繼續前進，京滬區路局所配置之列車今日可返還杭州，交通部聯運處對直達通車雖頗寄予熱望，然困難極多，經此次試車後，是否卽可正式通車，現尚不能確定。最大之難題有二：（一）浙贛近來軍運繁忙，軌道時被軍車擁塞，粵漢路客運增加，京粵直達車在該兩路上恐不能準點開到。（二）三路客運票價不同，且時時調整，聯運票價無法規定，如此次列車第一日開出京滬，兩路卽增加票價十倍，浙贛路於前天起亦已調整運價，且公佈以後每隔五天調整一次。粵漢路運價更以銀元計費，「大頭」行情早晚不同，票價雖不如「大頭」市價之時刻變化，然隨時均可能調整，如此次試車已發生不同票價，昨日旅客渡贛江沒人收渡費一萬元，行李渡費九萬元（限五十公斤，超過加倍），卽係以浙贛路新調整之標準計算，而未在原定費用內。</p>

<p>關於在滬之調查技術，各委員表示將機動運用，因地制宜，故難昨具體說明。財物清查之地點不限於上海一市，因此爲全國性之問題。調查之重點，不在國家財物之數目，而重在揭發陳弊，進一步予以懲戒彈劾。清理會已開始接受人民之控訴，截至今日爲止，已由若干訴狀收到。惟監院對人民訴狀，依法概不答覆，亦不能予以獎勵。</p>

<h3>禾預幹團學院出走歸來　痛恨賈亦斌　臨風雪涕淚</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉劍雄</p>
<p>〔本報嘉興十七日訊〕國防部預幹局駐嘉興的第一總隊，部份學員在本月六日的晚上自由出走，這不但使嘉興人民引爲驚　，同時亦引起全國人民的　驚。誰都曉得，預幹總隊的前身，卽勢戰時響應元首「十萬青年十萬軍」所號召的愛國智識青年們，他們曾經在抗戰時期，在緬甸公路有過不可磨滅的「光榮歷史」，勝利復員後，在蔣經國先生的領導下，鍜錬得更堅強，更敢果。因爲他們駐在嘉興四年有餘，在人民的目光中，認爲是中國唯一的「模範軍人」。這次突然的發生此一不幸事件，確爲全國人民所關懷，目前事變雖已順利解決，不過讀者對此事件之發生前因後果，恐尚不十分瞭解，記者爲此會分別往訪預幹局局長徐思賢將軍及脫離歸來之總隊長黎天鐸和學員，茲將經過後目前情況報導與後：</p>
<p>發動事變原因</p>
<p>學員完全受騙，沒有責任，賈亦斌是脫不了責任的」。當徐局長和黎總隊長與記者談話時首先就是這樣說。由此我們可以明白造成這次的事變，祗有賈亦斌一個人，那末賈亦斌是這樣一個人呢？他就是前任的預幹局長兼第一總隊的總隊長，湖北人，四十左右的年齡，此人雖有小聰明，而無大智慧。當他在任之日。利用青年人的熱情和苦悶，以「民主」作幌，朦騙學生，企圖以學生作爲個人的工具。平時言行偏激，每以迎合青年之口號來煽惑，博取學員的好感。自徐蚌戰事以後，深中了失敗主義的流毒，態度言行更明顯，調任爲國防部覺察，予以免職，調任部員派在南京衛戍司令部服務，何如彼不加反省，卻因而惱羞成怒，懷恨在心，乃秘密佈置心腹，希圖待機而動。最近共黨陳兵江岸，以爲時機成熟，冀希據地稱雄，卽潛來嘉興匿居鄉間，策劃叛變。</p>
<p>潛禾策劃叛變</p>
<p>賈是二日便服潛來嘉興，暗地吸引心腹集會，原定計劃在十六日發動。那末他爲什麽酒在六日的晚上匆促行動呢？這裏有著二種原因他無法照原定計劃從容地做。第一，預幹總隊已奉命調駐福州，一切都在積極準備了。第二，六日下午他的行動已爲現任的黎總隊長天鐸所發覺。黎氏因秉性仁厚，認爲與賈相處多年，且私人感情頗篤。故著人通知欲往勸說，曉以大義及利害。何如賈知事已敗露，一方面回覆說：「不必來看我，由我來看他」。所以不待黎氏往見，，卽臨時決定提前發動，這是六日晚上六點鐘的時候。</p>
<p>脅迫出走之夕</p>
<p>這個時候，黎總隊長正與潘副總隊長及祁總隊附等在辦公室商討隊部遷赴福州之一切問題，何和賈以賦的心腹，已武裝在四週密佈嚴戒，首先一二所謂「代表」者，向黎總隊長詢問：「我們總隊前途怎樣？」不一刻賈亦入室，同時室外嚴備更形加強，形勢頓現緊張，賈下坐後，卽與黎氏談話，僅述及風花雪月之事，後卽闖入學員十餘人，卽向黎氏報告稱：「現在我們準備做，聽聽總隊長副總隊長的意見。」黎卽問「你們究竟想做什麽？」他們的答覆是「只有上山」！黎復問：「除了上山難道沒有第二條路可走嗎？現在政府要我們到福州，這不是正當的路嗎？應該請你們研究。」斯時賈聲色俱厲的說：「祗有這樣做，非如此做不可。」當時黎等均表示不贊同，賈卽袖出原定計劃行軍圖，一面卽監視黎等，一面假傳黎總隊長命令「實施戰備行軍」，飭各中隊攜帶所有槍彈被服裝具，聽候出發。</p>
<p>當時因時近午夜大部學員都從朦朧中醒來，不明真相，竟受其愚。然十五，十六兩隊（卽政工與交通隊）以命令來自突然，頓起疑竇，不肯隨行，賈聞訊後正挾黎總隊長前往勸導，至中途復以時間不及折回，倉皇脅迫黎總隊長率領學員一千六百餘人向烏鎮方向前進。潘祁等就在此時乘機脫逃。</p>
<p>學員大起騷動</p>
<p>他們的隊伍七日抵達桐鄉境內，大部學員因長途跋涉，且又未進餐，倍感疲乏，已有怨言，同時被監視之黎總隊長，隨時相機透露消息，　學員歸隊，因此部份已故意落伍偷返，乃晚隊伍抵達湖屬烏鎮，賈乃集會學員講話，言辭中隱約道出此去目的地，乃已脫離一切羈絆，以爲藉此可鼓勵士氣，不意適得其反，悶葫蘆一經打開，各學員頓起騷動，賈見形勢不妙，復以威脅利誘之手段恫嚇說：「再回去就要殺」。於是學員等內心憤恨與恐怖交織，弄得進退維谷。部隊繼續前進中，爲地方團隊攔住了去路，繞道而行復走錯了途徑，與與阻隊發生衝突，又因學員衆多，行列冗長，隊伍顯現得極度紊亂，賈知必將有危，卽獨自下舟而行，監視黎總隊長之學員，爲顧個人安全亦放棄了任務，所以黎氏就乘這個機會，脫險歸來了。同時八日晚歸來之學員亦達五百人左右。賈亦斌在這個時候註定了失敗的命運。</p>
<p>叛變順利解決</p>
<p>至於總部隊方面，潘副隊長及祁總隊附等於脫險后卽與駐禾之交警十一總隊連絡派員追剿，同時電呈國防部請示，與浙省警備部，青年救國團等機關商討辦法。預幹局局長徐思賢將軍亦於八日來禾坐鎮總隊部，與各縣電話連咯以私人感情分請協助撫剿。政府當局因深知此次出走學員，多係受騙，除一面派兵追剿阻攔外，並派飛機散發傳單，闡明真象，曉以大義，青年救國團亦派重要人員，前往莫千山附近喊話，說明政府意旨，此時上山之學員七百餘人，於真象大白後，卽下山聽候政府處置。所以這次能獲得順利解決，除了徐局長的不辭勞瘁日以繼夜的指揮和省縣團隊撫剿得力外，歸功於飛機散發傳單，和青年救國團人員喊話的實在不少。</p>
<p>賈亦斌的命運</p>
<p>被賈亦斌騙走的學員，大部已歸來了，至目前爲止，該總隊的現有學員，已達二二三九人，照原來的人數二四九三人（除以前病傷送院一三三人外）相差僅一三一人，其中因此次事變而死傷的約有五十人左右，又有一部份學員因受此遭遇後灰心歸家者亦有多人。據最近歸來之學員談：「賈亦斌所帶著的僅一二十人，都已改換便衣，賈並向此一二十人前表示自己的命運謂：（一）你們將我打死。（二）我祗有自殺。（三）你們不把我送警備部去。由此可見，賈亦斌短期內將不難捕獲。</p>
<p>整編完成復課</p>
<p>黎總隊長歸來以後，因爲這次受了極大的刺激，神經失常，正在休養中，關於部隊的整編工作及善後處置問題，暫由預幹局長徐思賢將軍代爲主持，據徐氏告：整編工作初步已告完成，原有四個大隊，十六個中隊，目前已編就三大隊，不日亦可編程。惟此次事變槍枝及被服散失頗多，除訂定獎金辦法請各縣協助收集外，並派員分赴吳興，德清·桐鄉等縣，調查傷亡及武器散失情形，分別妥善處理外，並電呈國防部請求補救中。故自２十五日起開始復課，依照原定計劃實施訓練。此次出走後歸來之各位學員，均感悔恨交集，甚至痛哭流涕。」</p>

<h3>百米千石·黃金卅兩　常州國稅局被控貪污</h3>
<p>〔本報武進十八日訊〕邑國稅局長孫銘修，原任貨物稅局局長，平時恃其背景硬著，（傳係某黨國元老之外甥）經常奔走京滬之間，當年國大開會，伊攢謀得充會塲職員，襟縣紅綾缎條，搖擺回常，周旋酒肆，炫耀人前，宛似國大代表之一。無聊之狀，令人噴飯。厥後直接稅局與貨物稅局合併爲國稅局，損夤錄得法，取得局長，濫置私人，排除異己，一度引起重大糾紛。最近被本縣公民劉樹年羅列貪污瀆職罪行四點，向蘇浙監署控訴，事實約爲（一）去年十月孫局長風聞酒稅得徒漲十倍，乃於十月一日派該局秘書韓金琨去鎮打聽，二日反常復命，孫卽電召宜興分所米主人等面授機宜，卽日連絡各酒商提前完納預稅，互相勾結，獲私利二萬金圓（合米一千石）。旋經告發財部派觀察局可鳴來常澈查。孫銘修乃給周可鳴二千金圓券卒告無事。（二）該局職員萬安根本不到局辦公在外另有職務。在局掛名支薪。（三）去年九月廿五，孫局長大做其壽，全局停止辦公兩日，赴錫暢遊，事以祝　。（四）辦理卅七年上半年度營利事業所得稅，串通商會秘書予以勤浮收副稅卅六萬金圓，合黃金卅兩。緣武進商會素來跟照無錫收稅，無錫是次按卅六年二百倍計稅，常州乃按六十倍計稅，從中營私舞弊，全局上下均知。……控文指摘姓名年月，十分清楚。當可信徵。現監署電令武進縣就近查復核辦。縣府派財科朱科長進行調查，內情風雨雨，流言載道，據一般熟悉情形者談國稅局方面對於煙酒稅毛病亦頗大。</p>
<h3>論用人藝術</h3>
<p>— 徐道鄰</p>
<p>前年我從台灣回來，遇見陳光甫先生，我告訴他台灣遊覽事業之大有可爲，而勸他趕快著手去作。他說，他不是不知道作，也不是不想作，祗是他還沒有適當的人。這一句話充份表現了他是事業中人，而使我格外明瞭他的事業之何以成功</p>
<p>我認識幾位當代鉅公，他們確是公忠體國，宵旰勤勞。他們都是身兼數要職，整天到處的開會，訓話，講演，參加典禮，招待外賓，已經忙了個不休，而辦公桌上卻堆滿了一堆一堆的公事，要等他們一件一件的親手去批，有時還要等他們一字一字的親手去改，客廳裏坐滿了求見的客人，一個個帶了書報雜誌在那裏忍耐地等。最苦的事他們的一羣高幾僚屬，一個個皮包裏裝滿了所謂「最要件」的公事，從公事房追到會塲，從會塲追到公館，來等候他們的批示。有時這樣的苦追等待，一連三五天，還是湊不上這些大人先生們比較空閒的時候，候原來他們正在某某塲合上高談他們的　經濟理想和他們的哲學概念。</p>
<p>說他們不想好吧，他們是主義的信徒，是熱誠的愛國者。說他們不努力吧，他們是食少事煩，一個個都是高度的操勞過度。然而他們爲什麽還是作不出來什麽成績呢？這就是因為他們祗知道作事而不知道用人的緣故。古人所說「明君以求賢爲業」這一句話，不是他們的頭腦所能領悟的。</p>
<p>有的比較高明些的達官貴人們，他們似乎了解「求賢」的重要。他們確實是在周咨博訪，廣求賢才，他們會慕你的高名，不惜折節屈尊的前來拜訪。你來了他們會倒展相迎，吃飯時請你上座，殷殷勤勤的敬酒上榮。他們會給你高高的位置，尊崇的名義，和豐富的餽與．他們甚至於也可以託付你一個重要的職務，而付予你充份的權實．但是他們之所以用你，不是爲國家的事業求人．而是爲個人的地位著想，他們不是想給你機會去發展抱負，而是想拉你來裝飾門面．時間不久，他們不是覺著你不夠聽話，有些礙手礙腳，就是怕你羽翼漸豐，駕馭不住，於是由疏遠而歧視，由歧視而排擠，結果總不脫一個不歡而散．古書上說非成榮難得賢難，非得賢難用之難，非用之難任之難，正式這個道理．</p>
<p>所以歷史上人物的成功，第一個要素，就是知人善任，知是能知人，任長能用人．可是知人者未必能用人，而能用人者卻必定　知人，善用人的，他能發現每個人的長處而會找機會給他去發揮－天底下沒有一個全無長處的人，也沒有一個不　發揮長處的人。善用人的，知道怎樣的去提高每個人的工作興趣，知道怎樣的去增加每個人的工作能力，更知道怎樣的去增加整個集團的合羣性，所以靠更動人事以求整頓業務的人，固然是不錯，而能運用原有的人事，不添新人，不去轟人，祗靠工作的分配，賞罰的運用，而能使壞的變成好的，無用變成有用，所謂兼收並蓄，人盡其才，遂能轉移風氣，提高效能的，這樣才真正能算是會用的人。</p>
<p>會用人的人，必定有知人之明。知人談何容易！但是內中也有一個訣嚴，就是要鍛煉知人之明，必力求打破固有成見，而一個人的固有成見，必定是基於自私的立塲。換句話說，自私的必不能知人，，要知人必先求克己。一個真正的人才，對人未有不知者，而有時竟不知者，不肯知也，故不知也。此其一。再則人才之優劣，絕對的固不易知，而相對的則極易知。俗語說，不怕不識貨，就怕貨比貨。而一般用人者，就在這一個「比」字上，也不肯下功夫，還說人才難得，豈不可嘆！此其二。還有，一個人的才具如何，口說無憑，一試便知，所謂真金不怕火煉。一個知道爲事業求賢的人，必不吝嗇給人以一試身手的機會。堯以天下試蟬，況其餘哉！此其三。</p>
<p>會用人的人，必定還有一個美德，就是成人成物的觀念。我們用一個人，目的是在造就他，不是在幫助我。教他去作一件事，目的爲的是事情的本身，而不是爲對我之利害。以這樣的出發點去用人，人們焉得不努力效命？伯樂看見監車下的千里馬而扶轅大哭，千里馬亦悲痛長鳴，就是因爲伯樂是愛馬的，而不是一個從馬身上剝削利益的馬販子。</p>
<p>最後，能成大事業的人，就是說最會用人的人，必須還具備一個條件，就是容人之量，容他人盡量發展而自己不起戒心的雅量。（就是楊明所說的無不容之量，無所競人之心）。這個雅量，也就是澹泊的另一面。不過真正的澹泊，不但對名利，利祿，權利，看的淡，對事功也要看的淡，還是有所蔽，還將爲物所蔽。不過澹泊，並非消極之謂，澹泊的反面是熱中，三月不見其君則皇皇然無所之的，不能稱澹泊。澹泊也不是冷酷，因爲澹泊既無礙於抱負，更絕對有是非。不過好大喜功，嫉惡如仇的，不能稱澹泊，因為「好」「喜」「如仇」，皆動了意氣，便不成爲澹泊了。不管事勢環境如何變化，成功也好，失敗也好，順境也好，逆境也好，不得意忘形，不懊惱沮喪，內心裏的情緒意志，始終甯靜如一，這方是真澹泊。</p>
<p>人的類型是多種的，有機警的，有厚重的，有勇敢的，有謹慎的，有有德的，有有能的，長於此者，必短於彼。交朋友多半必須氣味相投，而用人時則決不可固立界限，有所偏好。必須認清環境，針對事實，必須真作到「爲事求人」，方能作得到「人盡其用」。</p>
<p>人們的長處不同，環境的需要也不同。現在用人的標準，我認爲居高位者必以氣節爲重。至於治事之才，我認爲應具備四個條件，一·見解，二·辦法，三·操守，四·魄力。最好四個條件皆能其備。不能具備，我認爲見解重於辦法，辦法重於操守，操守重於魄力。四者皆具備而更能知道提攜後進，樂育人才，從事樹人樹木的功夫，則更不愧爲人中上選了。</p>
<p>有些人作事努力而能力甚差，有些人雖有能力而不肯努力作事，二者之間，我們當然應當獎勵努力而罷免不努力的，不過善用人的人，在這個塲合，必定會下一番功夫，研究他爲何不努力的原因，而設法予以糾正。因為他知道；一個人的求用求知，是他的良能，和一個人的求生存，初無二致也。（完）</p>
<h3>青島破獲販毒機關案演變離奇複雜　黃公如致函本報記者措辭沉痛　稱此案涉及道德理智良心問題</h3>
<p>〔本報青島十五日航訊〕前青市警備部參謀長現調綏區高參黃公如，就本報本月二·五兩日所載青警備部人員貪污一事，致函本報記者，有所說明，措辭極為沉痛。函內略稱「查小港檢查站三月十二日舞弊案，本極單純，發覺後依法懲處，罪有攸歸，逎中經一再演變，最後竟有人利用穩（原文）密手段，顛倒是非，爲排斥異己，掩護親私，陷害忠良，便利營私之借口，致造成離奇複雜之情形，而無以善其後。」函中並直接指出記者所發消息，已「造成重大訛誤，與報導失實的責任·惟案情曲折，變化奇突，當事者且甚少能洞悉全盤經過。閣下採訪新聞，自難獲得充分材料，故亦不應苛責。我是對該案由懷疑而下令檢查源豐號，獲得證據，首先舉發這件貪污舞弊案子的黃參謀長，因爲受到壓力，又奉命本大事化小的原則，進行處理，最後，我不同意這種因私誤公的苟且了事的辦法，觸怒了一羣貪私小人，竟陰謀詭計，勾串網織，指誣我有嫌疑，由副司令項傳遠（記者按：警備部副司令）給我一個意外打擊，逼我離職，而結果毫無證據，毫無道理，我雖是離開了，然而苟且了事，仍難辦到，祗是保守秘密，可是不能解決問題。」函中又稱：「該案演變至今日，已不僅是法的問題，並涉及人們的道德離職天理良心的問題，亦卽現社會是否還有真理正義惡善是非的存在？作一考騐。我是在多種矛盾中，首遭犧牲者。我正在沉默地注視該案的後果。」該函中復作如下三點更正稱：「（一）五日報載黃參謀長手令檢查源豐號，確是對的，因爲該號是匪的運毒機關，就是接運該項匪區來款的商號，小港檢查站的貪污舞弊，也是由此揭露的，那麼就此可知道，我是該案的舉發人而不是嫌疑人了。……（二）該案發生於小港，舞弊機關爲檢查站，主犯爲站長于敬誠，案子本身實與警備司令部內官佐無關，與于站長夥同犯罪的事警備部以外的人，現因本末倒置，好像張通的責任嚴重，實則並不如此。（三）我辭職已三次了，字二月九日就簽呈求去，雖經項副司令同意轉請，但主官未准。這次的教訓，是甯死也不再幹了，劉司令官頒令調回綏區仍供原職，雖時間巧合，但任何長官絕不會從兼職機會裏調一個犯貪污嫌疑的官佐到主管機關裏作高級幹部的。至所謂「實已予看管」，則不客氣的說，有點記載荒謬了。（記者按：記者係根據關係方面透露消息記載，該案發生迄今，已逾一月，當局迄無正式消息發表，茲據原函發表如上。）</p>

<h3>國行在場外無限制拋售　金價昨明堅暗平　場內交易與場外脫節無法做開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市場，風平浪靜，市勢明堅暗平。場內交易依然停頓，照例掛八七一萬漲停板不動。場外現貨交易，因央行壓力重重，大戶蜷伏不動；買氣閑散。委託大德成兆豐昌金號，開盤卽以一二八〇萬限制拋售，因乏人問津，甩低到一二二〇萬，賣出二百條左右，人心安定。晨開平擊，爲一一八〇萬，一二三〇萬，徵高至一二四〇萬，一二七〇萬。瀕午因暗息不低，港金續有大量倒流，　碼充裕，各方面攝於財經改革方案，頻有了售，步低至一一七〇萬，一二〇〇萬午收。午後因隔日交易，加息二〇〇元至二五〇元，開盤一四五〇萬，一五〇〇萬，高至一四七〇萬，一五〇〇萬。中途央行續以一四八〇萬，低至一四五〇萬，大量拋金，買戶稀少，僅出十餘條，一路小至一四三〇萬，一四六〇萬，終以一四四〇萬，一四七〇萬晚收。結果較上日反軋跌一〇萬。</p>
<p>場外期貨交易，晨開一三〇〇萬，一三五〇萬，高至一三九〇萬，一四二〇萬，低至一二七〇萬，一三二〇萬，午收一三三〇萬，一三六〇萬。午後當日交易，開盤一三〇〇萬，一三五〇萬，高至一三三〇萬，一三六〇萬，低至一二七〇萬，一三〇〇萬，終以一三〇〇萬，一三三〇萬收盤，較上日回漲二六〇萬。隔日多空貼息，開低二〇元，爲二六〇元，二八〇元，差金以一六〇〇萬結價。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕開設未久之黃金市場，日來場內因有二成漲限約束，與場外價格，脫節日見遠大，更以在暗息高昂下每日漲限二成，僅合日息二百元，故漲停板乃爲必然之趨勢。如此市場停頓，將近一週。改善市場規則，目前央行業已同意，但財部至今　尚未有批示，故場內交易名存實亡。</p>
<p>日來各方對於央行在場外委託大德成，兆豐昌二家金號，大量拋金，頗有懷疑，記者特爲此事，叩詢兆豐昌金號負責人。該號與大德成代理央行拋金·每天央行有常駐監督員，會同辦理。價格方面，隨時向央行業務局請示，隨拋隨報，絕無流弊·僅取一厘佣金云·</p>
<h3>新空乘勢反攻　華股漲風已戢</h3>
<p>由於和談希望驟趨黯淡，華股數日之漲潮已漸見消退。況葉中銀根緊勢未解，暗息每千元一元左右，尚難拆進，人心已見委頓。「空」方大戶乘機抗壓，故前市市勢難見堅穩，後市且呈不振。</p>
<p>永紗以一百二十元高檔開出，開後一度高至一百二十三元，然曇花一現，未幾卽仍呈下游，徘徊約一時許，數度曾見脫疲上升，然仍被空方巨力壓下。十一時三十分，利息開出，高做一三五元，一四五元，人心頓呈糜疲，大戶十三號首開殺戒，一三五號一四五號，一六九號，亦集體湧惰，市勢直綫下退，最低曾做一百〇六元。蒞收十三號補空翻多，被拉高至一百十一元收盤，黃金公債臨登漲限，見四百十七萬七千二百元之最高格，餘股市勢均見先堅後疲狀態。</p>
<h3>外股高峯迭出</h3>
<p>外股高峯層出不窮，昨日市勢高見新高價，怡紗二十七萬進，二十九萬出，較上日軋升三萬五千元。</p>
<p>英聯三十一萬進，三十三萬出，較上日揚起五萬元，怡啤五萬元進，五萬三千元出，較上日挺起四千元，業廣九萬元，單面買進，與上日買價軋平。鋼業公司四萬九千元進，五萬二千元出，較上日騰起四千元。</p>
<p>中國紙版七萬元賣出，較上日升起二萬一千元，亞洲航業二萬九千元進，三萬元出，會德曁衝破百萬元大關，做一百十萬元進，一百三十萬出，計軋升十萬元</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日美鈔場外趨勢彈硬，因港地價格大漲，各帮搜求頗烈，業已與大頭分道揚鑣·晨開二五萬，二六萬，高至二六萬，二七萬，午收二四萬五，二五萬五，午後隔日交易，加息二〇〇元至二五〇元，開盤二九萬，三〇萬，較上日軋漲五萬之多。物物交換，美鈔九元五角，換大頭十元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元套匯，漸趨旺盛，天津帮有四·五家做出，大多爲茶款，套出款約十五萬，匯水每百元三元。又青島套出銀元匯款，見票遲二天交現，每百元匯水六元。漢口套匯，做出四十餘萬，每百元升水五元至八元不等·萬縣套匯袁洋升二元，滬匯出爲十天板期，交付現洋，成交額五萬至十五萬不等。貴陽袁頭套出，每百元升水十五元至十八元。滬帮有做出，數小而多，共達四萬左右·北平袁洋套匯無開，僅聞有五百元美金票套出，匯水頗高，每百元八元。江西帮套出大頭七筆，亦有升水，自一元至二元不等，因該地價格低廉，但多係土產商販運款，數頗微細。米帮款套無頭寸·湘帮長沙有若干筆套出，數甚龐大，聞係特種土產款，爲×部收購物資總數達卅八萬之鉅，除部份現運抵解外，該地多以折付當日價之金圓頭寸·經記者多處探詢，其套做方式及匯率，堅不吐實·</p>
<p>馬路交易起伏狹隘，晨間因央行金銀兌換比例不變，仍爲一兩黃金對五十二塊大頭，連日流出籌碼頗湧，人心治爲安定，大頭自二二萬，二三萬五，呆小至一萬五，午後喊價仍爲二二萬，二三萬五。小頭喊十七萬五，十九萬。鷹龍洋喊十三萬，十五萬·本票交易，大頭喊二三萬，二四萬，隔日交割·錢兌業大頭做高至二六萬，二八萬，交易不多。較上日微加一萬至二萬·</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日證交大樓，金銀交換比例，無甚榮辱，上午大頭初做四七，五〇，瀕午小至四六，四九，午後仍爲四七，五〇·小頭做五八，六一。鷹龍洋無市。</p>
<h3>中央造幣廠　每日鑄船洋</h3>
<p>中央造幣廠自開始鑄造銀元以來，產量逐漸增加，現每日鑄船洋廿萬枚，短時期內可增至五十萬枚·昨據該廠章廠長向華東社記者談稱，（一）中央銀行新向英國訂購白銀一百廿萬盎司，業已運到，鑄造船洋。（二）央行過去收兌之雜色銀元頗多，均將絡續改鑄船洋。上週六又有雜色銀洋三百六十萬枚運到。（該批雜洋聞多係由澳洲運來）（三）中央造幣廠在廣州昆明二地尚有造幣機械數架，卽將運滬·俟運到後，每日鑄幣量卽可增至五十萬枚·（四）該廠除鑄銀元外，十兩廠條黃金，亦仍繼續鑄造·</p>
<h3>保·値·存·款　實施細則擬妥</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財部保値存款原則經立院通過後，日前已由劉財長携滬，昨由各國家行局庫負責人集會商討實施細則，結果已將全部細則擬妥，卽交劉財長携京，一俟立院通過，卽交政院頒佈施行云。</p>
<p>又訊：據悉：國庫保値存款之存款證，現已由國行趕印中，係統一式樣，一俟就緒，卽由國行聯合行局庫在滬舉辦。其利息定爲最低三厘，最高一分，行局庫經辨手續費，擬訂爲千分之二，俟請示財部核定。</p>
<h3>限價昨再經放寬　米市交易漸正常</h3>
<p>米市限價昨再放寬至一百三十萬，市場交易已恢復正常，因銀根緊，各物均平，人心平穩，各貨均能在限價以內做開，貨主出樣甚多。米店以銀根緊，納胃呆，價反見疲軟。</p>
<p>自粳薄稻南北二市均以限價開出，中次貨價稍減，早稻一百二十八萬及一百二十五萬，二米市場到貨共計二四四三石。</p>
<p>食油市勢平穩，因銀根緊，出戶尚多，散戶不耐高利，亦均不納，價根少有上落。豆油開市七百九十萬，最高至八百十萬，收市八百萬，略升二三十萬。生菜油收市七百萬，吉桶生油七百七十萬，較前收市價漲七十萬，小車蔴油開七十六萬元。豆餅貨稀價挺，漲五六萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉漲風，前曾稍戢，昨復烈火重燃，緣因利買消息傳來，散戶力吸，持主乘機扳高，銀根雖緊，人心仍昂，市勢在百物平定聲中，獨挺二成餘。</p>
<p>老車晨開四十九萬五千元，中市步步上揚，收市創五十六萬新價。兵船臨收晋做五十三萬，收市後貨主逢高有吐，回站五十萬關，麩皮砌高一成，大包阜豐做四十二萬八千元。</p>
<p>雜糧市勢參差，黃豆以豆餅仍秀，市價堅定，多豆做百廿五萬，車豆喊做百廿萬元，苞米先堅後疲，生仁實銷極呆，回挫廿萬元。臨淮關生仁退守三百萬大關，芝蔴交易依然稀少，紅糧略見下游。</p>
<h3>棉紗起伏靡定　在市上落狹隘</h3>
<p>棉紗續趨高翔，因市拆高昂，故握貨者以成本關係，售出須加上拆息。昨日市勢起伏不大，圈外大多平定，人心亦告穩定，結果各紗所漲之幅度，僅夠一天利息。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由七八〇〇萬一路俏至八三〇〇萬爲最高，收市站住八〇〇萬大關，較前升一三〇〇萬。三二支銀月軋漲九〇〇萬，以五三〇〇萬結局。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨甫開卽竄出大關，創四一〇〇萬新高，一度曾哄抬至四四五〇萬，最後回鬆至四三〇〇萬，終挺九〇〇萬。二〇支雙馬接近四〇〇〇萬，爲三漲起二成至二成半。</p>
<p>昨日布市上落狹隘，晨初因銀根緊俏依然，價由低檔開出，嗣後逢低搜購仍見踴躍，市乃復趨堅穩，結果比隔日後市微有參差。</p>
<p>龍頭細布自一四二萬步退至一三九萬，近午客帮頻吸，遂創五一萬新高。臨收浮多獲利吐售，市勢又告帶小，終以一四五萬午收，軋跌二萬。</p>
<p>四君子嗶磯除以一三二萬開出，旋做小至一二八萬，中途最高達一四一萬，終爲一三八萬，較前挫四萬。</p>
<p>餘布均皆鬆落，僅跳鯉元光斜漲起七萬。後市龍頭一六五萬。四君子嗶嘰一六〇萬，中途曾各見進展，最後又告回小，晚收前者一六二萬，後者一五九萬。</p>
<h3>食糖買氣未衰</h3>
<p>食糖市況，昨日同業銀根雖緊，暗息高達二〇〇至二五〇元，但以買氣未衰，故上漲仍鉅，二四號粗砂，晨市一六八萬元，最高一八六萬元，最低一七六萬元，中午以一八四萬元收市，較昨軋漲三——二萬元，本廠冰糖二六〇萬，較前漲三十萬，賑記片冰三五〇萬元，較前漲七十萬元·</p>
<h3>黃金掉購銀元　國行昨起停辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行黃金掉購袁大頭銀元之辦法，昨起已暫行停辦故昨已停止公告黃金與袁大頭銀元之比率。</p>
<p>據該當局解釋：黃金掉購銀元之辦法，原爲便利工商各界發薪而臨時訂定之權宜措置，故掉購時必須通過銀錢行莊及金業公會會員之媒介，證明須爲發薪之用，方得掉購。茲月中發薪之時期已過，故該項掉購之辦法，當亦暫時停辦云·</p>
<h3>市場散步</h3>
<p>— 看台客</p>
<p>銀元向央行回籠　職工們貼息二天</p>
<p>兩天來，央行對於銀元，積極進行回籠工作。</p>
<p>發薪期吐出的銀元，兩天來，暗中積極搜羅進去。</p>
<p>今後指數每週公佈一次，廠商發薪，別頭寸的工作，更要繁忙。因此，央行準備銀元頭寸，也變成了例行公事了。</p>
<p>央行須要準備銀元這樁工作，是各種公事中最難幹的一樁。因爲發軍餉，爲數之大，可以想像的。本市掉給廠商行莊的，不過是九牛一毛的。</p>
<p>央行需要的銀元數量尤大，央行搜羅銀元的工作，尤艱鉅。因爲搜羅銀元，而銀元價不漲，才是本領。</p>
<p>兩天來，央行的本領，表現得很好。</p>
<p>消息源源而來：過去，盛稱財部向美購進大量黃金，且已運滬了。昨天，又盛稱財部向英國購進大量白銀，已經運到。</p>
<p>央行能取得新聞界合作，替他宣佈有利於控制市場的消息，無論是眞是假，總是好的。</p>
<p>所以，讓我也來努力一番：［央行運到大批黃金，央行運到大批白銀。黃金是要拋出的，白銀是要鑄造銀元的。特別是要鑄造袁頭的］。但必須聲明，我只做傳聲筒，絕對不能負責的，因爲我自己都不相信。</p>
<p>我們的努力，是有效果的。不觀夫最近二天，一般物價不漲，終也漲個利息來。銀元呢，倒貼了二天利息。</p>
<p>買銀元的人，不要焦急。每週發薪一次，每週就至少有一天，可以把倒貼的利息，全部漲出來，而且還有得賺。不過，必須把銀元捏着等這個機會。</p>
<p>假使隨用隨賣，當然會被暗中壓住了殺價收進去。</p>
<p>可是，拿了薪資買銀元的人們，都是非隨用隨賣不可的，所以，壓住收買，才有絕對把握·</p>
<p>過去，央行　小金價，便把動搖行莊的條子，殺價收進去。被行莊界痛駡一頓，現已識相得多，公然聲明「下不爲例」了！</p>
<p>然而，軟的不能變硬，央行的存在，也就失去其意義。</p>
<p>薪資階級手裹得銀元，現已成爲被進攻的對象。兩天來的演出，頗爲成功。</p>
<p>薪資階級是弱者，一盤散沙，不比亨裹亨，欺不得！</p>
<p>你看：工界在要求用銀元發薪。現在的辦法，却改爲每週公佈一次指數，這就是說：拿金圓券去。所以，今後金圓券的發行速率，已安排得好好的了。</p>
<p>眞的，軍餉搭發銀元之後，無法中途變更的。否則，「他媽的」一聲，頭都打碎了。</p>
<p>我很佩服央行二天來控制銀元市場的成功。但是，我總替央行道付擔子，捏把汗。因爲「無米爲炊」的巧婦，總不容易維持得久。央行賽過巧婦很能無米爲炊</p>

<h3>羽王費禮門遇勁敵　黃德福有驚人演出　比數接近緊張熱烈爲丹麥大賽所僅見　馬華雙打依然舉世無匹敵</h3>
<p>〔路透社哥本哈根十八日電〕丹麥國際羽球錦標賽經五日劇戰，於今日結束。美國費禮門獲單打冠軍，馬華冠軍黃德福血戰三局敗于費禮門，比數爲十五比十一，十四比十七，十七比十五，爲費禮門從來未曾經歷之劇戰。據丹麥專家稱：此場比賽，恐爲所有歐洲比賽中最精彩者。費禮門賽後告記者稱：馬華選手再經數次比賽，可能將其擊敗。費氏之弱點已爲馬華選手所發覺，開始向此點進攻。其正手抽擊最弱，手足之長度佔得矮小馬華選手之便宜。費氏已兩敗黃德福，一次在湯麥斯杯中，一次在英國錦標賽中。今日第一局，費先以三比〇，四比三居先，黃以六比五追出，費連得六分成十一比六，黃力趕成十二比十一，費又得三分，十五比十一勝第一局。第二局苦戰不己，黃先以二比一佔先，費來勢凶猛，一下成十二比三，黃連得八分，追成十二比十一，又打成各十三平手，黃以十七比十四奪回第二局，第三局費以六比〇佔優勢，黃大爲奮發，亦連得五分。費又以十四比十一居前，黃再拼成各十四平手，費卒以十七比十五獲最後一局。</p>
<p>馬華選手包辦之雙打決賽黃德福張成坤勝曾官良楊德才，十五比七，十八比十六。</p>
<p>女子單打決賽丹麥湯納恩勝桑台爾，亦爲丹人，十一比四，十一比三。</p>
<p>女子雙打決賽，由丹麥女子包辦，湯納恩與桑台爾勝史交遜與尼爾遜十五比八，十五比一。</p>
<p>混合雙打決賽，馬華曾官良與湯納恩勝梅特生與桑台爾，九比十五，十五比十二，十五比二</p>
<h3>大公挑戰麥令　今晚籃球有勁</h3>
<p>本市體育記者聯誼會爲大公籃球隊於去歲遠征南洋港菲班師後，尚未公開漏臉，爰徵得市委員會贊助，邀請該隊與美海軍第三麥令斯隊作表演賓，於今日下午七時在市體育館交鞖，賽前五時一刻起另增插曲二幕，首仗女子雅隊戰力隊，繼爲約翰對大同，門票售樓上一萬，樓下二萬，及場內對號座四萬元，爲防止擁擠起見，門票一律於午後一時起開始預售，大門一律四時開放，長期贈券照常通用，惟球員證不憑，屆時請四維童子軍到場維持秩序，三場節目先錄於下：</p>
<p>雅隊—力　隊（女子）五時一刻</p>
<p>約翰—大　同（男子）下午六時</p>
<p>大公—麥令斯（男子）下午七時</p>
<p>雅隊新軍成立以來，今日尚屬處女演出，麾下諸女將俱是久經沙場之流，朱家珍·黃如玉·孫鳳竹，以及錢夢月·汪澤綸輩，能征慣戰，蜚聲全壇，而王珊·朱敏·吳兆瑞·朱蘭貞乃本市全運代表，球藝尤為優越，是以全隊攻守俱佳，門力雄厚，力隊參加聯賽女組三年，雖名列末座，但奮鬥不懈，本屆市長盃中日前對黎隊僅輪十分，足見大有進境，今與雅咋逢，勢有一番火併。</p>
<p>繼為男子兩大學隊約翰戰大同，自大學專科以上學校籃球賽結束後，校隊比賽殊不多見，約翰執大學牛耳有年，擁甲組名手孫國政·陶瑩石·黃天烈·孫摩西·胡惠昭五虎，饒勇善門，技術超羣。大同有徐仲巳·樂嘉洲·李漢亭三劍客，爲甲一組華聯與仁餘隊之名將，身手不凡，球藝純熟，餘如董其文等亦爲個中能手，勝負難卜。</p>
<p>主力戰大公迎戰麥令斯，前者於客歲出征馬來亞·新加坡·馬尼刺·香港等處，大小四十戰，計勝卅四仗，和三次，負三場，戰績輝煌，聲震遐邇，隊長蔡文華，副隊長屠文龍，世運選手蔡忠強，球藝各有千秋，黃柏齡·詹琛·王存忠·葉雲山亦均具矯捷身手，自月前歸來後，猛練不聽，氣力充沛，今日初度正式漏臉，士別三日括目相看，當有刺激與熱烈之演出。</p>
<p>麥令斯自青島調滬，屢在聯賽友賽中出馬，頗具戰績，市長盃中原與警機相逢，後者窠權，乃改友戰綠林，當時殺得難解難分，兩度延長時間，仍未分勝負，足見其戰力雄厚之一斑。屆時強敵當前，番將精銳齊出，拼個你死我活，一場惡戰，必有如火如荼之精彩鏡頭也。</p>
<h3>中體聯籃球賽　民立雙喜臨門</h3>

<h3>港埠際足球在菲　再度大勝混合隊</h3>
<p>［合衆社馬尼拉十九日電］港埠際足球隊昨晚第二賽以八比一大勝馬尼刺混合隊。比賽爲一面倒，上半時後，列柴運動場觀衆，興趣大減。港埠前鋒郭英祺鄒文治及柴維爾聯合行動，將菲隊防綫粉碎。郭中三球，鄒文治與柴維爾各中二球，何應芬射中第八球。</p>
<h3>四屆乒乓甲組聯賽　聯星逞威破綢白　今晚六幕·甲組中行戰郵乙</h3>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，前晚八時甲組聯星出戰綢白，於綢業球室，到觀眾三百餘人，聯星鑒於青聯敗於綢白，故傾全力上陣，戰來不敢大意，尤以胡祚昌，胡一萍，馮浩三將，抽擊凶猛，勇不可當，綢白珠江楊昌熙力戰陳興權，二人惡門三局，興權防守有術，昌熙力竭，以一對二敗陣。末組聯星張善達演出鬆懈，綢白老將翁叔恒則加倍努力，以直落二輕取張善達，爲綢白打破鴨蛋記錄，結果聯星以四對一大勝綢白。其餘均爲乙組秩序，分在各球室交鋒，七場結果均如預料，未有差池，厥惟集後起之秀之優聯，竟以二對三之比，慘遭新運帆聲之毒手，堪稱冷門爆出，帆聲五將之經騐與球藝，咸不及優聯，但賴全隊之沉着抗戰，決不氣餒，終能克敵致果，奪得勝利，可謂不易。茲錄甲組兩隊戰績，及乙組各場結果如下？甲組戰績</p>
<p>乙組結果</p>
<p>紡四勝凌隊（乙一）四—一</p>

<p>星火—信誼（乙二）七時正信誼</p>
<p>中機—郵思（乙一）八時正郵思</p>
<p>甲組郵乙，亦屬沙場久戰之師，除朱仲孫朱慶基演出非常火爆外，他如削手戴永泉，顧鶴華，及抽手沈愛仁等三將，擊球姿態，殊見儒雅，全隊球藝平均，此次尚係初次出馬，將有良好之表演。中行不幸於首仗中見挫於郵務，今晚再遇郵家兵馬，爲報復敗於郵務一箭之仇，必出全力赴，鏖戰難免。茲錄兩隊名單如下：（郵務）朱仲孫（隊長），戴永泉，朱慶基，沈愛仁，朱錦海，戚文苑。　（中行）竺永康（隊長），王紹曾，朱國楨。蔣孝湜，謝國才，高鐘麟，屠光榮，梁文彥。</p>

<h3>乒乓須知</h3>
<p>— 工心昴書　陳霖笙校</p>
<p>（九）乒乓的基本練習</p>
<p>上面說明拍乒乓先要練「近擋」。在練習的時候，應該注意高低和方向的節制，高低和方向有節制的把握，是拍乒乓頂基本的練習。對於這兩種拍法練習以後，再進而練習個中拍法，是很容易的，在這兩種拍法沒有練「到家」，先摹做名手拍球的姿勢和方法，反會油腔滑調，勞而無功的。</p>
<p>高低的節制，除習乒乓的人，爲了各種動作都不熟習，拍出的球，往往不能得心應手，這是一定要經過的階段，練習勤的進步快，對於理論方法有相當的研究的，進步更快，有些人到了拍球雖有相當的成績，但對於拍出的球，只能心領神會，而不能知其所以然的，就是在理論方面沒有深切研究的緣故。　拍出的乒乓球的高低，要有節制的方法，是基本的技能。乒乓球在拍時的有高低，其理由大約不外下列幾點：</p>
<p>球員與球的距離關係　在球來往的時候，自己離開乒乓檯很遠，而對於拍來的球，離網很近，球勢又很弱，向檯前去接已來不及，不得不把手臂儘量往前伸，以補萬一，球拍也愈成扁平式，拍出的球就愈高。要是自己離檯很近，拍出的球正在擺幅的中端，球的高低就很適當，就是要球極高或極低，也很容易，不像離檯遠的心有餘而力不足了。爲什麽球拍愈扁平，拍出的球就愈高呢？這完全從乒乓拍與球所成的角度，上發生的，所成的角度愈小，拍出的球愈低，角度愈大，拍出的球就愈高。</p>
<h3>民主盃足球主力戰·　·今日九洲相逢華光</h3>

<p>和安·柏樂戴　桃霍絲·蕙絲　雅蓮·彭絲</p>
<p>美國三位女子籃球國手，身長都在五呎十吋以上</p>
<h3>美國女籃三傑</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕雅蓮·彭絲，桃麗·蕙斯，和安·柏樂戴是全美女子業餘籃球選手隊的三鋒。也是美洲女籃常勝軍藍隊的台柱。自從一九四二年起，藍隊一直是籃壇祭酒。上季大小四十戰，更是所向披靡。</p>
<p>構成藍隊這條攻無不克的鋒綫的這三位女將，都有着不比我國男子球員短的身長。</p>
<p>雅蓮·彭絲（見鉅圖左首，球褲上有六顆星者）是藍隊和全美選手隊的隊長。這位廿六歲的紅髮女郎身長五呎十一吋，體重一百五十磅。自一九三八年中學畢業後，前後參加過十餘隊，每次都必被推爲隊長。一九四〇年應選爲全美代表後，每年必登金榜，今年已經是第九次入選了。彭絲小姐球藝驚人，左右單雙手俱有百發百中的妙技。去季與某隊決賽時，彭絲恰在前一天傷了右膀，但仍勉力出場。結果以左手獨得三十三分，力克強敵。彭絲又能虛心下人，與同隊親愛如姊妹，待受傷及年幼者如慈母。非重要戰役，更往往退讓賢路，讓後起者常有出場機會。但去年一季，却仍獨得五百九十六分。</p>
<p>桃麗絲·蕙斯，廿五歲，身長五呎十吋。是進能攻退能守的鋒衛全材。作風殺辣，打衛時往往使敵鋒望而卻步，金髮的溫斯也常常以此自豪。球場外，溫斯待人接物，和藹可親，與打球時判若二人。是大西洋城某石油公司的秘書。</p>
<p>「豹女郎」安柏樂戴，有和蕙斯一樣的身長，體重五十四磅。「豹女郎」是一位芳齡廿三，嬌生慣養的富室千金。除了打籃球外便是整天坐汽車在公路上風馳電掣地兜圈子；晚上却最喜歡施展另一套地板功夫——倫攞和水手舞·「豹女郎」又最愛打棒球，是勒盛頓男子棒球隊的一壘手（曉星）</p>

<h3>不要「假定」</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>「假定」，本不是什麽怕人的名詞。因為它不但含有很大的問號，而且更具有絕大的伸縮性，——可以如此，但不一定如此；還使人存有「並不如此」的一綫希望。</p>
<p>然而現在，假定是一個可怕的名詞了。其威脅的力量，並不下於代替漲價的調整，以及數字後面一連串的圈圈·因為現在的「假定」，在假定的當時，固然還使人含有一點也許不致如此的憧憬；而其實，待到價的事實宣佈時，則所謂「假定」，每每膛乎其後。美麗的憧憬全給粉碎了。</p>
<p>舉例來說：如三月上半月的生活指數，是一千三百多倍；三月下旬的公用事業假定指數，是二千二百多倍；「假定」的增價數字，是百分之七十弱。然而三月下半月的生活指數，則是三千六百多倍，實際增長了百分之一百八十弱。這一事實的表現，等於公開地告訴市民，這「假定」，還是最低的估計。如果你不是白痴，便該從「上」看。於是乎「假定」一「定」，便百物先看齊！</p>
<p>又如四月八日所發表的公用事業假定指數，是六千九百餘倍，較之三千六百多倍的指數，又增加了百分之九十強。如果仍照上月成例，則我們四月上半月的生活指數，至少要過一萬一千多倍。這却並不是「假定」了。</p>
<p>因為「解決鈔荒建議，小組委員會」十一日開會時，以一萬倍作本月上期生活指數的「假定」，來籌措發放工人薪水的現鈔。由此看，早知將「不幸而言中」了。</p>
<p>當然，指數的規定，是以物價的升降作標準的，它的猛昇並不是它的本身的罪惡。「假定指數」也是一樣，只不過是新舊指數交替中的一個「假定」，也並沒有它本身的罪惡。</p>
<p>然而不知怎樣，我總覺得一月兩次的生活指數的發表，已確够人心驚肉跳了。而今又憑空添上了兩次「假定指數」，眞使人有屋漏偏遭連夜雨的感覺。因為「假定」一「定」，雖不是眞「定」，而百物看漲，則是百試不爽的。</p>
<p>小民早給生活壓迫得喘不過氣了，當局能不能發點善心，取消了這個「假定」，給市民减輕一點痛苦呢？</p>
<h3>有所感</h3>
<p>— 覺者</p>
<p>革命成功者被稱為「英雄」，不成功者却往往被稱為「叛徒」。誰都說金錢是萬惡的東西，但無人肯把自己的金錢白白送給別人。</p>
<p>「科學造福於人類」，許多人都這麼附和說。但沒有想到，像炸彈，大砲等殺人利器，也是科學的產品。</p>
<p>有人說：「人生若夢」。那末希望豈不是「夢中之夢」嗎？</p>
<p>使人煩惱的事「慾望」，使人興奮的也是「慾望」。</p>
<p>過一個生日，就是離墳墓的距離更近一點；這樣看來，生日不但不値得慶祝，反而很値得悲傷。</p>
<p>人生的目的，似乎專為了來撕幾十份日曆似的。</p>
<h3>談改善指數</h3>
<p>— 黎杰</p>
<p>利以後的採用生活指數計薪，的確替上海社會尤其是勞資糾紛上减少了不少麻煩。指數這東西，幾年來有其不可抹煞的功績。但近一二月來，由於金圓券的急劇貶値，物價每日間會漲上五成甚至一倍，致使以生活指數計算的薪津，與實際需要大大脫節，工人們弄得啼笑皆非，生活朝不保夕。指數間題，至此似乎又須考慮改善一下了。</p>
<p>生活指數的數字，本身是絕對科學化的。而且，就它的計算方法說，也是十分準確的。有人看見生活指數與眞正物價脫節，疑心每半月的指數審議會上，必有討價還價之舉，把眞正的指數打個七折或八折。這話我不相信。因為當局如果要做手脚出花樣，在調查時便可做，何必愚至於此，在指數算出後再打折扣，致給人拿着把柄？生活指數的本身是沒有毛病的；那麼毛病是在什麽地方呢？在調查的次數上。</p>
<p>指數原是過去半個月間物價的大體記錄。而今日，因為工人與指數計薪階級都是以上半月發表的指數，折合薪津，來過下半月的未來的日子。所以這「歷史的記錄」似已成了是「事先的標準」。生活指數每半月要調查好幾次，物價還相當穩定的時候，第一次和末一次的調查相差不多，則平均數自然也差不多；但在物價急劇上漲的時候，情形就大大不同了。譬如半個月中，第一次調查米每石是一百萬元，第二次調查一百四十萬元，第三次調查一百八十萬元，第四次調查二百四十萬元。四次的平均，即上半月中米價的平均價格，是一百六十五萬元。這第四次調查，是在生活指數發表的前一天，即廿九號。等到指數發表，錢拿到手時最早也已一號。隔了兩天，米已經漲到二百八十萬元了。這個平均數那裏能買得到一石米？只能買五六斗！</p>
<p>由此，可是在物價劇烈波動的時候，用平均計算的方法是絕對不行的。因為工人職員拿來的工資或薪津，本是應付指數發表以後的生活，不能倒退幾天回去，補買一百六十萬元一石時候的米。所以，指數自然以愈接近發表日的物價，也愈合理。</p>
<p>今日見報載，總工會已要求當局改變辦法。總工會不知是否已有辦法提出，我覺得，目前救急，只須取消每半月中前幾次的調查，而改為每期只調查一次，即每月十四日和廿九日（月大為三十日）調查一次，次日立即公佈。如此，則指數與物價就可不致脫節太大了（編者按：現已決定改為週薪制。）</p>
<h3>貢獻財金改革意見</h3>
<p>— 克雲</p>
<p>近來財政金融當局的幾位　　諸公，雖然很懂得做生意的技巧，高吐低收，利用拋金賺錢；然而對於窮的見底的國庫，恐怕也仍無濟於事。敝人忝屬國民一份子，熟思之餘，倒研究出幾點辦法，謹此獻給財政當局。如能採及，保證賺錢，富國裕庫，綽綽有餘。爰陳述如后：</p>
<p>第一點，不妨照以前加値郵票的辦法，將收回的法幣和小額金圓券，加藎「暫作金圓×萬元」的字樣，當然可以省去一大筆印刷費和大批精良的紙張。至於鈔票的破爛呢，那倒無妨於事，只要明令公佈：所發鈔票一律不再收回。鈔票既本已破爛，又流經衆人之手，一旦到不堪使用時，只好焚却或送入垃圾桶內，自然通貨也就不再會膨脹起來。等到廢鈔用罄時，便可以採用國產的連史紙或毛邊紙等來印，效果相同。對於提倡國產紙張的增產，更大有裨益。</p>
<p>第二點，關於現在拋金的辦法，實在不够澈底。似可以選定一日，將金條以低於市價之半的價格，拋得乾乾淨淨。如果人民頭寸不够，可以將房地產或銀元折算金圓券，同樣收受如此，大衆自定趨之若鶩。不過有一件事要注意，就是請購者的住址必須記下。拋光之後數小時，突然發表緊急命令，宣布黃金國有。反正請購者的住址現成，立刻發動大批人馬，按圖索驥，弚回原物。這樣憑空可收回流出的金圓券，又可賺進房地產和銀元等等。隔了幾天，又宣布人民可以持有黃金，以後一而再，再而三試行這個辦法，當然大得其利。</p>
<p>第三點，宣布以後公教人員及軍人的發薪發餉，一律照當地生活指數不折不扣計算，並且提高其底薪。但是發給的只一小部份是現鈔，其他大部份是「國庫股票」。幾次下來，股票發完，就來一套增資的辦法，每一股必須認繳幾股。如果有願意認繳的，又可收回許多通貨；不能認繳的，股票宣布作廢，且不足之數由「董事會」負責募足之，將來又可發出。如此，就不愁有發不出薪津的事情發生了。</p>
<p>以上三點，不論採取一種或全部採取，對於財政均可大有帮助。惟最好再請醫藥或化學界人士，發明一種麻醉藥品，散在空氣中，使全國人民都神經麻木，則行使起來自然更為容易了。</p>
<h3>法寶又破了</h3>
<p>— 朽木</p>
<h3>公教人員</h3>
<p>— 顯微生</p>
<p>筆者　恨爹娘不該替我讀書，害我終生跌入「公教人員」之門。在行政機關裏，足足當過十年差使；在教育機關裏，比較還要長一點。橫來豎去，始終沒有跨出這道「金戶限」。</p>
<p>惟其如此，一生命運休矣。所以每聽到「公教人員」四字，簡直要頭痛起來。</p>
<p>有人說：公是「公職」，教是「教員」，不能混為一談，何況還有「省級」「縣級」之分。譬如每一次調整薪給，那省級的，何等直接爽快，鈔票就拿到手了；而縣級的，却遠可以好好打個瞌睡再說。</p>
<p>還有人說：不但如此，此中更有奧妙。就是依照薪給標準發放以後，也有不同的遭遇。譬如你與會計先生是同鄉，或你是貴上司帶來的人，那麼，平日逢到青黃不接之時，借支薪水起來，就比較有把握一點；否則，自然不必開口。</p>
<p>總之，最倒霉的，當然是「教」；尤其是縣級的「教」，最沒有生路。像最近上海的市立教員，還有二千七百倍的到手，而咱們貴縣——太倉呢，開學以來，却一倍也沒有發過。聒得當局腦經靈敏，在開學的時候，先來一個「籌集教育臨時基金」運動，小學食米三至五斗，才得苟延殘喘至今。但杯水車薪，就是全部動用，每人每月尚不及「折腰之數」，——所以我那得不要怨我的爹娘呢！</p>

<h3>Government to Continue Thorough Discussion Today; May Request a Few Days' Extension to Consult with the CCP on Proposed Amendments</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The government's response to the eight articles and twenty-four clauses proposed by the CCP was not fully concluded in the day-long important meeting held on the 19th. It was decided that the meeting would continue on the 20th for a final decision. At 9:00 AM on the 19th, Acting President Li and Premier He Yingqin convened the Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee at the Ministry of National Defense. In addition to a brief explanation by He, Huang Shaohong, the representative who returned from Peiping, was invited to report on the progress of the peace negotiations, and advisor Qu Wu provided supplementary explanations. The report included: (1) the individual exchange of views from the beginning of April 1st to the 12th, and the records of several meetings with Bao Zhedong; (2) the situation and detailed records of the two general meetings on the 13th and 15th; (3) the conditions proposed by the CCP and the process of discussion; (4) the contacts with third-party figures and the opinions of the third-party figures; (5) the attitude and practices of important figures of the CCP. Huang and Qu's reports were extremely detailed, lasting for more than three hours before adjourning. The meeting continued in the afternoon, during which He presented the CCP's twenty-four clauses for discussion. Ju Zheng, Zhu Jiahua, and Wu Tiecheng, who had returned from Xikou, reported on the conclusions reached in Xikou with President Chiang on the peace issue. The meeting adjourned late in the evening. The afternoon session involved clause-by-clause discussions, so any clauses deemed to require significant changes could be unified. Those of a major nature did not reach a conclusion. This reporter interviewed participants after the meeting, but they did not disclose any opinions. What is known is that the ordinary clauses of the twenty-four clauses are not non-negotiable. Although there may be disagreements in terms of timing and implementation, it is widely believed that after the amended proposal is presented to the CCP, it will not be dismissed without consideration. As for important issues such as the crossing of the Yangtze River, they still require thorough research. Therefore, the meeting will likely reconvene on the morning of the 20th. Those attending the meeting today were Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, Zhang Cui, Ju Zheng, Zhu Jiahua, Wu Zhongxin, Xu Yongchang, Wu Tiecheng; those attending as observers were Huang Shaohong, Qu Wu, Huang Shaogu, Huang Yunchun, Bai Chongxi, Yan Xishan, and Liu Jianqun.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The government's response to the CCP may be telegraphed to Peiping by midnight on the 20th. In order to make the progress of the peace talks known to the people, it is currently considering issuing a statement simultaneously with its response to the CCP. Both of these matters will be finalized at the political affairs meeting to be held at 9:00 PM on the 20th. The Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee convened by Acting President Li on the 19th is a party internal decision-making body. The Executive Yuan is the responsible cabinet, and all decisions must be approved by the political affairs meeting. The Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee will reconvene on the morning of the 20th. In the afternoon, He Yingqin will attend the Legislative Yuan to report, so the Executive Yuan's routine meeting will be changed to 9:00 PM to reach a decision before the deadline and inform the CCP.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Ju Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhu Jiahua, who went to Xikou to request instructions on the peace negotiations, returned to Shanghai on the 18th. On the morning of the 19th, they flew to Nanjing at around 9:00 AM. After getting off the plane, they went to the Ministry of National Defense to attend the Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee meeting convened by Acting President Li.</p>
<h3>Premier He to Visit the Legislative Yuan Today to Give a Comprehensive Report on Peace Negotiations, Including the CCP's Demands and the Government's Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Legislators requested to understand the progress of the peace negotiations and the content of the draft peace agreement. Wu Yanhuan and 47 others proposed a temporary motion at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 19th. At the same time, Premier He Yingqin also decided to attend the Legislative Yuan's special meeting on the afternoon of the 20th to give a comprehensive report on the progress of the peace negotiations, the CCP's demands, and the government's determined countermeasures. Wu Yanhuan's motion was to request the Executive Yuan to submit the peace terms to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation before the peace agreement is signed. The legislators spoke one after another, and most believed that before understanding the progress of the peace negotiations and the CCP's demands, the Premier of the Executive Yuan should be asked to report first. Moreover, the Legislative Yuan has already authorized the government to conduct peace negotiations. If this case is carried out before the peace negotiations are finalized, there is an obvious contradiction in the procedure. However, some legislators did not oppose the deliberation. There was no objection to inviting Premier He to report and inviting committee member Shao Hong to attend to exchange views. In the end, it was decided to ask Premier He to attend the Legislative Yuan to report before making a decision.</p>
<h3>Tong Guanxian and Liu Jianqun Invite All Legislators to a Banquet to Report on the Progress of the Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian and Vice President Liu Jianqun hosted a banquet for all legislators at the International Fellowship Club at 12:00 noon on the 19th, with more than 200 people attending. Tong arrived late at 1:00 PM due to attending the Peace Negotiation Guidance Committee meeting. He briefly reported on the progress of the peace negotiations and the situation of the meeting on the morning of the 19th, and said: "There has been no meeting for discussion. The 19th was the first formal consultation. The report that Acting President Li has telegraphed the CCP requesting a postponement is not accurate." He concluded: "The Legislative Yuan should support the government in the location of the government. No matter how it evolves in the future, the five branches of the government will act together." The banquet ended at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Huang Xuchu Returns to Guangxi; Li Pinsian Arrives in Hankou from Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Guangxi Chairman Huang Xuchu was summoned to Nanjing by Acting President Li to report on his duties. After completing his business, he flew back to Guangxi from Nanjing by special plane at around 5:00 PM on the 19th. Mrs. Huang Yunchun, Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Palace, and Mrs. Cheng Siyuan, wife of a legislator, also returned to Guangxi on the same plane. It is also learned that Mrs. Guo Dejie, wife of Acting President Li, will also return to Guangxi from Nanjing within a few days.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 19th] Li Pinsian arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing at noon on the 19th. It is said that the future of the peace negotiations has not yet reached a state of hopelessness.</p>
<h3>Relatives of Important Officials in Nanjing Are Departing</h3>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Nanjing is outwardly stable today, and there is no chaos due to the approaching CCP deadline. All industries are proceeding as usual, which is very different from the situation three months ago when the communist army first arrived on the north bank of the Yangtze River. However, those who have the means to leave Nanjing have already departed. The families of some advisors to Acting President Li also left Nanjing today. However, train transportation is normal, and there are no extra flights. Rumors that the government has begun to move to Shanghai cannot be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Stated Yesterday That There is No Need to Go to Peiping</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] After his trip to Peiping was postponed again, Yu Youren told reporters on the evening of the 19th that he no longer needed to go to Peiping.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Peace Negotiations Expected; Even if the Deadline is Reached, They Will Not Immediately Break Down</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The 20th is the date set by the Communist side for the government to sign the peace agreement. The government's attitude must be decided by midnight on the 20th at the latest, so that the government delegation in Peiping can be notified as soon as possible to convey it to the CCP. Authoritative sources revealed on the evening of the 19th that the government has decided on the following two points: First, before noon on the 20th, the government will telegraph its representatives to inform the CCP, explaining the various practical difficulties, and request an extension of the signing date (possibly extending it by five days to sign on the 25th). Second, during the extended period, the government will propose amendments to facilitate consultations with the CCP. The source also stated that the signing of the peace agreement is of great importance, and the government must thoroughly discuss and unify the opinions of all parties within the party, so that this peace agreement can have integrity. The government's opinion on the most difficult part of the CCP's terms is that everything should be decided by the coalition government after it is established. The proportion of each party in the coalition government should be clearly stipulated, and the Kuomintang should have its due position. As for issues such as the crossing of the Yangtze River and the reorganization of the army, they can be left to the coalition government to find a solution, and there is no need to raise them during this period when the fighting has not stopped, so as to avoid complications. If the government's amendments can be considered and adopted by the CCP, then the future of the peace negotiations will be promising.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] An authoritative observer said on the evening of the 19th: "Although the 20th is the deadline set by the CCP for signing the peace agreement, it does not mean that if the agreement cannot be signed, the communist army will cross the Yangtze River." The observer believes that whether the communist army crosses the Yangtze River depends on its strength. If the peace negotiations have not completely ended and the communist army crosses the Yangtze River, the government army will resist. Whether the communist army can achieve its goals at that time is still a question. Now that the 20th has arrived, the signing of the peace agreement will be postponed. Regardless of whether the government requests a postponement or whether China agrees, the communist army will not cross the Yangtze River on the 21st if the agreement is not signed by the 20th. Moreover, when the peace negotiations began, it was foreseen that there would be many difficulties. There will inevitably be some twists and turns during the peace negotiations. Success is not easy, and it will not break down with the first setback.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaohong's Sentiments</h3>
<p>Wrote "Good Things Approaching" in Peiping</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Huang Shaohong, the government's peace negotiation representative, wrote two poems to express his sentiments in Peiping. The original poems are as follows:</p>
<p>"Good Things Approaching"</p>
<p>First</p>
<p>"Looking up at the long sky, people are settled, light smoke envelops the blue, waiting for a new moon to be full, wanting to ask when it will be round. Last night I took a nap and dreamed of Jiangnan, wild fire burned the Cold Food Festival. Fortunately, a sail sent wind, reporting news from Yan and Yun."</p>
<p>Second</p>
<p>"The north country is blooming, and the flowers in Jiangnan have fallen, only the red apricot by the wall remains, lonely and melancholy in the guest's quarters. At this time, for this enemy, I have given up my spring tour appointment, but I urge the god of spring to be careful, and not let it drift away."</p>
<h3>Non-Combatants in Wuhan Ordered to Evacuate Southward</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 19th] Relatives of staff and non-combatants of a certain high-level agency here have been ordered to evacuate southward. A team has taken a car to Hunan, and the rest will depart in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Draft Organizational Law of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Amended and Passed by the Legislative Yuan; Name of Affiliated Resources Committee Decided to Remain Unchanged; Re-Examination of the Proposal to Improve the Treatment of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The 16th meeting of the Third Session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 AM on the 19th. Tong Guanxian participated in the eleven-member committee and amended and passed the draft organizational law of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Article 8 of the original draft, "The Ministry of Economic Affairs may add, merge, or abolish various departments and affiliated agencies with the resolution of the Executive Yuan Council and the Legislative Yuan," was deleted by resolution, so the organization of the Ministry of Economic Affairs no longer has room for flexibility. In addition, at the request of Minister Sun Yueqi, after repeated discussions, it was decided to rename the Resources Bureau attached to the Ministry of Economic Affairs as the Resources Committee to avoid modifying the names on domestic and foreign contracts. At the same time, it also saves the waste of changing signboards, seals, and public funds paper due to the name change. In addition, all were passed without objection. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 4:00 PM. Liu Jianqun was also unable to attend due to official business. Zou Shuwen was elected as the chairman to discuss: (1) The proposal to quickly and reasonably adjust the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants nationwide was resolved to be re-examined and submitted for discussion at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 22nd. (2) The proposal by Zhou Shusheng and others to abolish military agencies, strictly prohibit vacant military positions, establish a military expenditure budget, and increase the treatment of soldiers was resolved to be jointly reviewed by the National Defense Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Finance and Banking Committee. (3) The proposal by Zhou Shusheng to establish special articles to sanction market monopolies in order to avoid unreasonable price fluctuations and ensure people's livelihood was resolved to be jointly reviewed by the Economic and Resources Committee, the Civil Law Committee, the Commercial Law Committee, and the Criminal Law Committee. (4) The proposal by Rong Zhao and others to request the government to protect industries throughout the country, not to damage them due to war, to maintain national vitality, and to benefit production was resolved to be jointly reviewed by the National Defense Committee and the Economic and Resources Committee. (5) The Finance and Banking Committee and the Civil Law Committee reported on the joint review of the proposal by Kong Geng and others to request the re-revision of the standards for clearing bank deposits and housing loans before the war to show fairness and convince people. It was resolved that due to lack of time, it would be left for discussion at the next Legislative Yuan meeting. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee met at 6:00 PM on the evening of the 19th and decided on the agenda for the 17th Legislative Yuan meeting. In addition to the cases that were not discussed at the 16th meeting, the following reporting items were added: (1) The Executive Yuan's request to review the draft organizational regulations of the Hainan Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Office. (2) The Executive Yuan's request to review the abolition of the Tungsten and Antimony Purchase Regulations. Discussion items: (1) Review of the amendment to the organizational law of the Examination Yuan, abolishing the Ministry of Examinations, with its business directly handled by the Examination Yuan, and shrinking the Ministry of Personnel into the Bureau of Personnel to simplify and save public funds. (2) Review of the draft provincial and county autonomy general rules and the Executive Yuan's draft legislative principles for provincial and county autonomy general rules.</p>

<h3>CCP's Northeast Political Council Establishes "General Accounting Bureau"</h3>

<h3>Peiping Peace Talks Temporarily Adjourned; Government Representatives Awaiting Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] After the CCP announced the eight articles and twenty-four clauses and stipulated the 20th as the signing date, the peace talks in Peiping have obviously been temporarily adjourned. According to related sources, the government's peace negotiation delegation is currently awaiting instructions from the government to continue further consultations with the CCP representatives. In recent days, they have only been in private contact with the CCP and third-party figures. According to relevant sources, the government delegation encountered many difficulties after contacting the CCP representatives at the beginning of their arrival in Peiping. Later, after Zhang Zhizhong and all the representatives met with Bao Zhedong one after another, the situation gradually improved. The eight articles and twenty-four clauses proposed by the CCP represent only a very small part of their opinions, but the main ones are all CCP demands. The full text was proposed by the CCP representatives at a formal meeting, stating that the draft has been adopted by the government and third-party figures. In addition, it is difficult to make any further concessions. At the same time, the deadline of the 20th was announced, hoping that the government would express its attitude before the 20th so that it could be signed on the 20th. Huang Shaohong's delay in returning to Nanjing for three days was due to the CCP proposing the eight articles and twenty-four clauses. After the second formal meeting at midnight on the 15th, the government representatives decided that because the deadline was approaching, they decided to ask Huang Shaohong and Qu Wu to take the entire plan back to Nanjing on the morning of the 16th to request instructions.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Fiercely Bombards Taiyuan City; 1,200 Shells Land in the City; Eastern Battlefield Only a Li Away from the City</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] In the past 24 hours, in addition to fiercely besieging Taiyuan City with a crowd of more than 100,000, the communist army also launched all its artillery and bombarded the Kuomintang army positions inside and outside the city. According to a preliminary report obtained by the military here at 8:00 PM on the 19th through a wireless phone call with Taiyuan, more than 1,200 shells landed in the city, and more than 5,000 shells landed near the Taiyuan Pacification Office and the Drum Tower. Residents relied on bomb shelters, so although there were casualties, the damage to residential houses was incalculable. The only airport in the west of the city that could still land yesterday is now becoming increasingly difficult to use due to the approaching front line and the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The battle to defend Taiyuan has entered its fifth day, and the war is gradually entering its climax. The two armies of Nie Rongzhen and Xu Xiangqian, totaling 20 armies, plus an artillery division, launched a full-scale attack on the four suburbs of the city from the night of the 18th. In the eastern direction, after a night of fighting, the battlefield has shifted from Sanjian Tree to the Machang and Wohushan areas, which are only a li away from the city. In the northern direction, due to the higher terrain, fighting continued on the line about three or four li away from the city on the 19th. In the southern and southeastern directions, the battle line had shifted to the Qinxiandian, Yangjiabao, 123 Barracks, Black Camel Village, and Zhaobi Tomb, which are more than ten li away from the city, by 6:00 PM on the 19th.

More than 200 shells had landed by noon, causing heavy casualties and losses to merchants and residents.

There were over nine rounds of contention in this area, and the battle situation was extremely fierce. Residents of the provincial capital were awakened by the sound of cannons and machine guns. The fighting continued until dawn on the 19th. Shiye Island is currently being steadfastly defended by the defending troops. Furthermore, around 1 a.m. on the morning of the 19th, over 10,000 Communist troops from Dongxincheng in Yizheng attempted to capture the bridgehead of Shierwei in one fell swoop, but were suppressed and forced to retreat after the defending troops coordinated with the navy to launch artillery bombardment. In addition, a large number of Communist vessels have been concentrated near Sanjiangying. The National Army is currently closely watching the next move of the Communist forces. There have been constant small-scale encounters in the Guazhou and Liuzhou areas.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] The situation on the Guazhou side across from Zhenjiang has not calmed down, and fierce fighting is still taking place near Shierwei. Lisi Island (Shiye Island) in the river south of Shierwei is still being firmly defended by the National Army. Rumors that it has been attacked and landed on by Communist forces are inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 19th] After Communist forces seized Yongan Island, follow-up troops continued to land on the 19th, and approximately 6,000 troops have now arrived. Furthermore, according to a well-informed military source, the Communist forces facing Zhenjiang will not be able to threaten the southern bank but will only be able to carry out attempted crossings or artillery bombardment on the southern bank from the northeast and northwest.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 19th] Communist forces in Xinzhou, Gaoqiao, and Sanjiangying on the north bank of Zhenjiang attempted to cross the river on the evening of the 18th but were repelled by our troops.

By 3 a.m., the Communist forces, unable to withstand the pressure of our intense artillery fire, retreated. The battle situation then subsided. At 4 a.m., Communist reinforcements, along with three mountain guns, launched a fierce attack on the direct north of Shierwei, and fighting continued into the evening. Over a hundred Communist troops were discovered at the Shatou River estuary between Sanjiangying and Guazhou across from Zhenjiang. They were dispersed after naval artillery fire.</p>
<p>[Reuters Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] A shocking cable this morning stated that the Communist forces made their first large-scale attempt to cross the Yangtze River last night, 55 miles east of Nanjing. An entire division or more of Communist troops, at around 10 p.m. last night, divided into over 1,000 small boats from Lotus Island in the Yangtze River, 12 miles northeast of Zhenjiang, and began to attack the southern bank. At midnight, National Army gunboats and cannons on the southern bank opened fire fiercely on the attacking Communist forces. The Communist forces have not been able to gain a foothold. Lotus Island was occupied by Communist forces 24 hours ago.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 19th] Amid the tense atmosphere along the entire northern bank of the Yangtze River, the Liangpu area on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway also remained in a state of suspense.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Can the United States Still Afford to Wait and See?</h3>
<p>Amid the rising demands in the United States for increased aid to China, Secretary of State Acheson's letter to Congressman Connally has been released. This letter has dampened the spirits of those advocating for aid to China, but it has also provoked the indignation of senators, filling the Senate with condemnation and accusations. This has forced officials in the State Department to resort to self-deprecating explanations, such as "the rising tide of Asian nationalism will prevent the Soviet Union from controlling China" (Special Dispatch from Washington by various news agencies, 17th). Whether the United States should increase aid to China is, of course, a matter for the United States itself, and it is not appropriate for the recipient country to express an opinion. However, this issue is no longer a simple question of "right" or "wrong," but rather a question concerning the peace of the entire world. We cannot bear to see Secretary of State Acheson misled by erroneous intelligence, leading the United States astray and repeating historical mistakes in the Far East, in China. Therefore, we cannot help but write this article to correct this terrible misconception that exists between the United States and China.</p>
<p>Acheson's letter to Congressman Connally was issued on March 15th. Because of its significant implications, its release could weaken the Chinese government's position in peace talks, so it was not made public for some time. However, Senator Green, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, requested that the letter be released, and it was therefore released to the public on April 16th. The contents of this letter explain the State Department's views on the McCarran $1.5 billion aid-to-China bill. The full text has been translated by the United States Information Service and published in various newspapers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Summarizing the main points of the letter, we can identify the following: (1) Since the victory in the war, the United States has provided China with over $2 billion in aid; however, the economic and military situation of the Chinese government has still deteriorated to such an extent that it is unable to resist the continued southward advance of the Chinese Communists in South China. (2) The failure of the Chinese government's troops is not due to a lack of ammunition and equipment; even if the United States provides further military aid, it will not be able to change the current state of affairs in China. (3) If the United States continues to aid China, it will only prolong the Chinese civil war, increase the suffering of the Chinese people, and ultimately deepen anti-American sentiment among the Chinese people. (4) If the United States wants to reverse the current deterioration of the Chinese government's situation, it would need to deploy a large number of armed forces for actual combat, which would violate the United States' traditional policy toward China and its own national interests. Therefore, Acheson concludes, "The State Department believes that the aid to China proposed in this bill, regardless of its scope or nature, cannot be guaranteed by the current environment in China." However, fearing that this overly passive policy toward China would provoke public discontent, Acheson opened a small "door of convenience" at the end of his conclusion. He said, "The government has considered requesting Congress to extend the term of the 1948 China Aid Act, so that the remaining unpaid funds (approximately $54 million) can be allocated for a certain period of time after the act expires on April 2, 1949. If the situation in China can be clarified during this period, further suggestions may be made." This letter fully exposes the contradictions in the US policy toward China. Acheson still adopts a wait-and-see attitude toward the situation in China, on the one hand being misled by erroneous information, believing that continued aid to China would not be helpful and would only deepen anti-American sentiment among the Chinese people; on the other hand, he is afraid of public criticism and still keeps the "door of aid to China" open. This indecisive, hesitant, and procrastinating attitude will undoubtedly cause endless sighs among the Chinese people, and even the American people will express deep disgust. Therefore, the Senate is filled with voices of opposition to Acheson. Republican Senator Bridges demanded that Congress investigate the State Department's policy toward China; the original proponent of the bill, McCarran, accused Acheson of providing Congress with erroneous and false information and showing weakness to the Chinese Communists. The New York Times believes that the government cannot hesitate on the China issue. Although Acheson did not respond directly, his aides have defended him, saying, "Even if the Chinese Communists achieve complete victory in the civil war, Asian nationalism will still prevent the Soviet Union from controlling China. Therefore, once the civil war is over, China will inevitably exclude all foreign forces. The government's policy of 'hands-off' toward China is for this reason." This self-justifying and self-deprecating statement only reveals its far-fetched arguments. We only need to raise the following two questions, and Acheson will be unable to answer them.</p>
<p>First, the postwar US foreign policy has been based on the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan." In a nutshell, it is based on the four words "anti-communism and anti-Soviet Union." In the past, in the hope of compromising with the Soviet Union and jointly building peace, it did not even care about making blatant expressions. But today, the Atlantic Pact has been signed, and the encirclement of the Soviet Union has been formed. Even President Truman warned all countries that the United States would not hesitate to use atomic bombs for world peace. The United States is so anti-communist and anti-Soviet in Europe, but in the Far East, Acheson takes a different view of the Chinese government, which is the most anti-communist, and adopts a wait-and-see attitude. How will Acheson justify this? Stetson said, "The failure to implement the Marshall Plan in Asia is our most tragic failure." What does Acheson think about this?</p>
<p>Second, there are many people in the United States who have many illusions about China, believing that China has no international character and is just a political party advocating land reform. Some even think that Mao Zedong can be China's Tito, not subject to Moscow's control. There was reason to hold this illusion in the past, but today, it is nothing but a blind diplomat who still uses this to justify and mock himself. Haven't you seen Mao Zedong's telegram opposing the Atlantic Pact yet? Haven't you heard that one of Mao Zedong's eight conditions is to abolish all traitorous treaties (the Sino-US Trade Treaty, the Sino-US Mutual Agreement, the Sino-US Relief Agreement, and the 1947 Sino-US Agreement)? Conducting diplomacy without being realistic is like a blind man riding a blind horse, and won't it cause a catastrophe!</p>
<p>In short, the situation in China is about to take a turn for the worse, and the threat of communist forces in the Far East is becoming more serious. Can the United States still afford to wait and see? Former Secretary of State Marshall has admitted his mistakes and resigned. How can Secretary of State Acheson repeat the same mistakes? Communist forces are now developing towards the world's "vacuum zone" - Asia. The success of the Chinese Communists is the beginning of communist forces controlling the entire Asia. How can Acheson blindly evade reality and still adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude? The accusations of the Senate are not enough to worry about, but the criticism of historians is cruel and cannot be ignored.</p>

<h3>Continued Operation of Gold Trading Regulations Approved by Hong Kong Financial Authorities; General Expectation that Black Market Will Still Exist</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] The Gold and Silver Exchange's regulations for the continued operation of gold trading were approved by the financial authorities this morning. They will be implemented after being discussed and passed by the Exchange's members' meeting tonight. It is understood that the principles stipulated in the regulations allow Exchange members to continue trading an appropriate amount of industrial gold (95 gold) to supply jewelers and dentists. The Gold and Silver Exchange will no longer engage in speculative gold trading in the future. However, it is generally expected that the black market will still exist. For example, the Exchange has stopped reporting telegraphic transactions to Guangzhou, but there are still so-called "outside market" transactions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] Although there are no official gold prices, black market trading is quite active. Today is the second day of resumption of business for the jewelry industry. Both buyers and sellers conduct semi-public transactions through jewelry stores. The buying price is HK$330 per tael, and the selling price is HK$345 per tael.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] Regarding the Hong Kong government's ban on buying and selling and private storage of gold, a Hong Kong government spokesman made further supplementary explanations this morning, stating that the ordinance only targets future gold trading and does not affect the existing gold holdings of Hong Kong merchants and residents. From a legal point of view, those currently holding gold cannot sell it, and the government has no intention of acquiring gold from the public. The rumors circulating in the market that the government intends to freeze gold stored in bank safety deposit boxes are unfounded. Regarding the banks or legal entities authorized to engage in gold trading, the government will announce them publicly. According to financial circles, although the government has no intention of acquiring gold stored by the public, the public's gold holdings are legally frozen before authorized banks begin buying and selling gold. However, black market sales are expected to flourish, and the public's gold holdings will be smuggled out, shifting Hong Kong's gold market, which has long been the most active in the Far East, to Macau.</p>
<p>[Finally News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] According to Deputy Financial Secretary Yandell's explanation to the chairman of the Jewelry Industry Association this morning, the gold ordinance only regulates pure gold and 95% gold, while 22-karat gold, i.e., anything below 22 karats, can still be freely bought and sold. Regarding the management of jewelry sales, jewelry stores must register the names and addresses of buyers for authorities to check at any time. Each buyer is limited to buying three taels per day. All existing jewelry stocks in jewelry stores must be reported to the authorities within the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>The West Insists on Lifting the Berlin Blockade; Door Open for Four-Power Negotiations; Plan to Establish West German Government Not Abandoned; Soviet Envoy's Mission to the US Confirmed</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] Diplomatic circles said on the 19th that the West has rejected the Soviet Union's tentative proposal to end the Berlin blockade but has kept the door open for further negotiations. Sources said that the Soviet representatives have been solemnly informed that the West can accept: (1) simultaneous termination of the Soviet blockade of Berlin and the Allied opposition; (2) a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference after the blockade is lifted to discuss the entire German question. However, it is claimed that the West will indicate that the plan to establish a West German government will continue regardless of Soviet opposition. Negotiations between East and West on the Berlin issue are reportedly being conducted through the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik. It is reported that Malik initially suggested that the West suspend its plan to establish a West German government in exchange for lifting the blockade. Malik implied that this would lead to a Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the German question. Diplomatic circles here said that this proposal was submitted to the Western Big Three Foreign Ministers - Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman - who were meeting in Washington at the time. They apparently decided that they could not accept any suggestion that would make them abandon the West German plan, but they were willing to reconvene. The reply was given to Malik, and was as informal as when Malik initially raised the suggestion. Diplomatic circles also said that the next action now needs to be decided by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Reliable German sources close to the Soviet military headquarters report that a Soviet official left Berlin for Washington yesterday on a secret mission to the Soviet Embassy there. It is said that the person will also obtain detailed information on the Atlantic Pact in the United States, and its consequences for Western Europe, especially West Germany. The envoy is accompanied by another Soviet person. Although his name has not been announced, it is believed that he is General Malinin, a financial expert and confidant of the Communist Party Politburo. Malinin was Sokolovsky's financial advisor when he implemented the Berlin blockade. However, Malinin's main topic of discussion is not the Berlin blockade. People in the Soviet military government are reluctant to reveal whether the envoy will be received by US Secretary of State Acheson. It is understood that before leaving Berlin, Malinin had detailed talks with General Chuikov, the Soviet military governor in Germany, and his political advisor, Semionov. It is also learned that Dikanokov, another Soviet expert on German issues and the last Soviet ambassador to Germany before the war, was also in Berlin during Easter. Malinin often accompanied former Soviet military governor Sokolovsky to Allied Control Council meetings. Malinin has many aliases, one of which is Georgiev.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Diplomatic circles say the few remaining trade relations between East and West German ports may become a path for the Soviet Union to propose an end to the Berlin blockade. If the Soviet Union can conduct one or two trial shipments successfully through the anti-blockade line, the result may be a gradual relaxation of restrictions on both sides without any "formal" agreement. The huge cost of the airlift to the United States so far will make Congress and taxpayers happy to end it, but rather than let Berlin fall completely into Soviet hands, the airlift will continue.</p>

<h3>Second Day of US Military Exercises; Air Force Regains Air Superiority by Defeating a Larger Force</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 19th] In the largest exercise in Germany since the war, two advancing units of the simulated enemy army invaded Germany from the Czech border on the 19th. "Enemy aircraft passed through the American defense" and "attacked two important occupied headquarters." The US Air Force was ordered to retake air superiority in Germany. About 100 American aircraft took off. The enemy aircraft was able to control the airspace based on the assumption that the number of aircraft was three times that of the American aircraft, but the American aircraft fought hard from the supply line 300 miles from the Atlantic coast to the front line 95 miles from the Czech border. "The enemy" continued to cause unrest in the American rear during the day, "damaging" important railway equipment in Mannheim. Communication was cut off this morning when "enemy aircraft" attacked. Ten officers and a repair team tried their best to repair it, intending to restore communication as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Stettinius Re-emphasizes the "MacArthur Plan" Urging the US to Broadly Aid Asia, Allocating $1 Billion to Support South China and the Entire Asian Continent</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 18th] The last Republican presidential candidate, Stettinius, the history professor at the University of Pennsylvania, sent a letter to the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin today, re-emphasizing the proposal to formulate a "MacArthur Aid Asia Plan" to go hand-in-hand with the Marshall European Aid Plan. Stettinius declared that many people misunderstood his speech delivered in Boston on the first of this month, and it is necessary to supplement and clarify it. He is not asking for aid to China alone, but for aid to Asia as a whole.</p>
<p>The US government's actions in Asia after the war violated the judgments and advice of most fair scholars around the world. Although the European Recovery Plan formulated by former Secretary of State Marshall was the most important achievement after the war, the failure to implement the same basic method for Asia was our most tragic failure. Asia is different from Europe and cannot be treated as a direct object, so he suggested borrowing the name of a great hero and calling it the "MacArthur Plan" to symbolize that the United States will expand further assistance to many peoples and lands in a vast part of the world. According to the plan, the United States should allocate $1 billion annually to support South China and the entire Asia, in order to prevent communism. This measure is necessary to counteract aid that is conducive to the Communist Party's rule in China. The US State Department must take action immediately to support South China. The new plan is not only to aid Japan, China, or Myanmar, but is a pan-Asian nature. The aid methods include improving transportation in China and Myanmar, developing inland river hydropower projects in India, and promoting the revival of the Philippines and Japan. In addition, the trade methods between Asian countries should be stipulated. The United States currently has "no policy and plan" for Asia, and the government should formulate this plan as soon as possible and hand it over to those who are familiar with the Asian situation.</p>

Mr. Mondale said that the United States is building higher, wider, and more expensive embankments on one side of the river in an attempt to contain the tide of communism, while on the other side, allowing the red flood to flood the blue Asian plains is the most harmful and frustrating thing.</p>

<h3>Second Economic Conference; Silver Dollar Problem Becomes the Focus of Discussion; Four Resolutions Passed, Meeting Continues Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The second economic conference of this city was held at 3:00 p.m. yesterday in the City Hall Conference Room, presided over by Secretary-General Chen Liang. The attendees included Minister of Finance Liu Kung-yun, Commander of the Garrison of Jinghu-Hangzhou Tang Enbo, Garrison Commander Chen Daqing, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs Cao Peizi, Fang Zhi of the City Party Headquarters, Deputy Speaker of the City Council Xu Qiwei, Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Bi Delin of the Economic Control Bureau, Pan Shihao and Ouyang Lun of the Industrial Association, Tian Heqing, and Wang Xiaolai, and more than 40 representatives from relevant agencies. The discussions on the shortage of banknotes, the use of promissory notes, the buying and selling of silver dollars, and the use of silver dollars as the unit of pricing for wages and commodities were very heated. The conference adjourned at 6:30 p.m., and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the solution of the banknote shortage and the use of promissory notes on the same day, the Central Bank and the Gold Control Bureau are requested to consult on detailed measures before the end of this month and notify relevant agencies for their reference. (2) Whether silver dollars can be used as currency and whether silver dollars should be used as the standard for prices and wages should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review. (3) Regarding the management of silver dollar transactions: A. Banks, pawnshops, commercial firms, and post offices licensed by the government may buy and sell silver dollars, but they must first register and obtain a license. B. Mobile vendors should be concentrated in designated areas for management, and detailed measures should be formulated by the municipal government's competent authorities in consultation with the Central Bank and the Gold Control Bureau. C. Whether pawn shops should be allowed to resume business should be considered and decided by the Ministry of Finance. (4) Due to time constraints, the issue of wages being denominated in silver dollars will be discussed again at 2:00 p.m. today in the City Hall Conference Room by the relevant agencies.</p>
<h3>Minister of Finance Liu Kung-yun Attends to Report on the Contents of the New Financial Reform Plan</h3>
<p>Before the economic conference was held yesterday, Secretary-General Chen first invited Minister of Finance Liu Kung-yun to report on the contents of the new financial and financial reform plan that had been revised and passed by the central government. He briefly stated: The financial and financial reform plan has been revised according to President He's administrative guidelines and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for revision and approval. The more important contents are: (1) The original provision that customs yuan must be purchased from the Central Bank with gold and foreign exchange has been changed to allow purchase with gold yuan notes. (2) Commodity tax will still not be collected in kind. (3) The system of collecting salt tax in kind will be postponed. (4) Direct tax and profit tax will adopt a distribution system. (5) Property tax will be implemented. (6) Commodity tax will still not be calculated by quantity, and fines for overdue payments will be based on the principle of preserving value. The Central Bank will formulate separate measures. (7) Maintain foreign exchange settlement convenience for industry and commerce as much as possible, and implement fixed-order loans and value-preserving deposits. (8) Implement value-preserving deposits and value-preserving insurance. (9) In terms of trade, imports will be restricted. The Ministry of Finance is considering the issue of tax exemption for gold and silver imports proposed by the Legislative Yuan. Value-preserving deposits are being actively prepared, and value-preserving insurance will be formulated after consultation with the insurance industry. The customs system is currently being drafted overnight by the Direct Tax Bureau and other agencies for implementation and public announcement.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu analyzed the city's soaring prices, stating: The government's implementation of silver dollar payments has led to a sudden increase in government expenditures, which has affected price increases. However, I dare to guarantee that the entire economy will not collapse, because the government has not yet used its strength and still has sufficient power to respond. We should implement the new financial and financial reform plan with great confidence. Anyone who disrupts finance will be severely punished. We hope that all sectors will help us overcome this difficult situation together.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Tang's Three Points</h3>
<p>After Minister Liu finished speaking, Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo expressed several points: (1) The new financial and financial plan was revised and formulated based on actual needs. It is hoped that all sectors will unanimously support it and jointly solve the current economic difficulties. The Central Bank's sale of gold, silver, and foreign currency cannot solve the problem. Emphasis should be placed on encouraging production, making the transportation of goods smooth, so that industry and commerce can be maintained, and a large amount of daily necessities should be purchased and stored. (2) The lives of workers should be effectively guaranteed. (3) At present, rural residents use rice as the unit of transaction. It seems that the city can also use in-kind or silver dollars as the unit of pricing, which can help stabilize finance.</p>
<h3>Banknote Shortage Will Not Happen Again</h3>
<p>Minister Liu's answers to the issues raised by the General Labor Union and the Industrial Association regarding the use of silver dollars as currency, silver dollar transactions, banknote shortage, and the use of promissory notes are as follows: (1) Silver dollars cannot be used as currency, but they are allowed to be freely traded, because the circulation of silver dollars and gold yuan at the same time would have too much impact on the gold yuan. Moreover, after the military's non-staple food expenses are changed to silver dollars, they must be allowed to be freely traded. As for whether the silver standard will be adopted in the future, the Ministry of Finance is currently considering the government's strength and will wait for the opportunity to make a decision. (2) Silver dollar transactions can be listed by the Central Bank every day. What needs to be considered now is also the issue of strength, because the government does not have enough silver dollars. (3) The formation of the banknote shortage is due to the Central Bank's inability to print large banknotes in time, resulting in a disconnect. Now, after printing day and night, it is guaranteed that this situation will not happen again in the future. (4) Whether promissory notes can be used on the same day is a technical issue, and it will definitely be improved after research.</p>
<h3>Garrison Headquarters Proposes 12 Recommendations</h3>
<p>In addition, the twelve recommendations on economic measures proposed by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters were resolved yesterday to be distributed to the competent authorities for review. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In order to fundamentally achieve a balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, reduce issuance, or a sound monetary system, and increase production and smooth the flow of goods, in a wartime economy, it is almost impossible. Here, nine people make recommendations for adverse causes and industries and what should be improved and what can be done as follows: (1) Reduce speculative firms - there are too many firms in Shanghai, too little capital. Except for their signs and facades, there is almost no capital to speak of, and all are credit speculation. The amount of silver dollars in each firm's pre-war capital should be converted into gold yuan notes, and the existing capital and the percentage of its reserve funds should be checked. Those who are short in the above two items should have their licenses revoked or merged. (3) Implement silver dollar value-preserving deposits and loans - the former requires no fixed deposit period, fair calculation, and convenient remittance and allocation, which can be achieved. The latter can provide an outlet for the government's stored funds and prevent the national treasury from suffering losses. (3) Allow the use of silver dollars - on the one hand, salaries are paid in silver dollars, and on the other hand, they are not allowed to be used. Isn't this self-contradictory and intentionally creating silver dollar traffickers? The Central Bank should list prices every day and allow them to be converted into gold yuan notes for use. (4) Reduce credit expansion - except for the Central Bank, no one is allowed to issue promissory notes, and those who are far away should be closed down. (5) Reduce the currency circulation rate - while the Central Bank sells gold, it allows gold notes to be mortgaged, so a large amount of currency still falls into the hands of speculators and accelerates circulation. It should be absolutely forbidden to mortgage gold notes. (6) There are restrictions on industrial and commercial loans - based on purchase orders, payment for goods, and verification of goods. (The above six items should be strictly implemented by the Gold Control Bureau, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance) (7) The price increase of public utilities should be limited - the subsidy policy should be reconsidered. (Please ask the Municipal Government to forward it to the relevant central authorities for prompt action) (8) The prices of important daily necessities should be subject to review. (9) Monitor the market, remove intercom telephones, and prohibit price gouging. (10) Crack down on the silver dollar market, express riders, and silver dollar peddlers. (10)(1) Inspect the business account books of firms and shops, and close down those that specialize in speculation outside of their business. (10)(2) Practice thrift - electricity, gasoline, banquets, etc. should all be economized. (The above five items should be strictly handled by the Municipal Government in conjunction with the relevant authorities) Today's problem requires recognizing the seriousness of the situation, preventing economic collapse, ensuring order, and stabilizing people's livelihood. It is impossible not to break through relationships and sacrifice the extra benefits of some people, and strictly handle it. I hope that some measures will be taken, which would be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee for North-South Barter Joint Management Office to Be Established</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Shipping Association recently held a symposium on the North-South barter issue. It was unanimously agreed that the government has, in principle, agreed to the North-South barter issue, and the industrial and commercial sectors should quickly establish a preparatory committee for the North-South barter joint management office. It is learned that the preparatory committee has tentatively designated 17 executive committee members, 7 from the Industrial Association, and 5 each from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shipping Association. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Municipal Industrial Association, will serve as the Chairman, and Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the National Federation of Industrial Associations, and Xu Jiwei, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, will serve as the Vice Chairmen. The organization will be submitted at tomorrow's North-South Barter Design Committee meeting. If it is approved, it can be formally established.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Request Improvement of Fee Collection Methods</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Recently, the rise in prices has been alarming. The city's water, electricity, gas, telephone, and public transportation agencies have been deeply affected and are on the verge of collapse. They have requested the competent authorities to quickly improve the fee collection methods to cope with the prices that change several times a day. According to statistics from the Shanghai Waterworks Company, from March 5 to April 5, the company's income listed on the issued bills, calculated according to the exchange rate on the date of issuance, can be considered equivalent to over 77,000 British pounds in currency value. When converted according to the exchange rate when the funds were received, it only amounted to over 47,000 pounds. The company's losses due to slow collection of funds are considerable. Other companies are also in the same situation. The Shangli Power Company and the French Water and Electricity Company, etc., suffer losses of about half of their total income each month due to currency depreciation. The gas company regularly maintains more than one month of coal reserves, but it currently has only seven days' worth of reserves due to its inability to replenish them. As for the transportation sector, the city's public buses' total income each day is not enough to cover the cost of gasoline alone. The current oil reserves are not enough for half a month. The companies are facing great difficulties. It is believed that without improving the fee collection methods, they will be completely shut down. They have urgently requested immediate remedies. The competent authorities believe that public utilities are deeply and significantly related to the city's industrial production and social stability, and they are carefully studying countermeasures to the requests made by the companies.</p>
<h3>Citizens Who Have Not Received ID Cards Should Apply for Them as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government announced that during this period of martial law, citizens, whether at home or abroad, must carry their ID cards with them for inspection by military police and Baojia personnel at any time. Those who do not carry their ID cards will be severely punished. Citizens of all ages who have registered their households but have not yet applied for ID cards must apply for ID cards from their local district offices as soon as possible, and have ordered Baojia personnel to strictly enforce compliance.</p>
<h3>Prices Soar Like Crazy; Vegetable, Fish and Meat Prices Rise the Most; Actual Sales of Spring Fashion Greatly Reduced; Many Large Companies Use Silver Dollars for Pricing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In recent weeks, the price increases have been like crazy, and the general salaried class has reached a stage where they cannot afford it. According to a research report by an academic group studying prices: In the past half month, the prices of vegetables, fish, and meat have risen the most rapidly, averaging more than 100,000 times higher than on August 19th. Next is soybean oil, and then rice and grain. The actual increase rate of gold bills and Yuan silver dollars is not as high as that of commodities. Because commodity prices fluctuate too quickly, the scene of the past when the legal tender depreciated sharply is reappearing on the market. Prices are different in the morning and afternoon, and prices vary from district to district. For example, a fried dough stick is priced at 3,000 yuan in the Central District, but in the Nanshi area, it is as high as 6,000 yuan. Because the purchasing power of ordinary citizens is becoming increasingly weak, actual sales in various stores are sluggish. In the past, fashion stores were booming every spring, but this year's actual sales have been reduced by about 60-70%, so the doors are unusually bleak. In the larger companies, both buyers and sellers have tacitly agreed to use silver dollars for pricing. Many companies have also added old-fashioned accountants who have been retired for many years to specialize in identifying the silver dollars delivered by customers. The trading methods of twenty years ago have reappeared, which is truly touching.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Route 3 Will Be Rerouted Starting Tomorrow; The Transportation Company Has Less Than Half a Month's Worth of Oil Reserves</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Due to the soaring gasoline prices, the income from fares is not enough to purchase the required amount of oil, and the current oil reserves are decreasing day by day and are not enough for half a month. In order to avoid affecting the entire route, the city's public transportation company has decided to temporarily reroute the three routes starting tomorrow (the 21st): (1) Route 12, which originally detoured through Haining Road around North Henan Road, Tianmu Road, and North Zhejiang Road, turning into a section of Xinzhapu Road, will be rerouted to run straight along Haining Road to Xinzhapu Road. (2) The southern end of Route 13 will be changed to start from the Lujiabang Road Daxing Street bus terminal, with a temporary shuttle bus between Daxing Street and the original starting station, Nanmatou. The northern end, which originally ran from North Tibet Road through Xinjiang Road turning into North Zhejiang Road to the North Station, will be rerouted to turn from Central Tibet Road into East Beijing Road, Central Zhejiang Road, and North Zhejiang Road to reach the North Station. (3) Route 14, which originally ran from Zhabei Road through Jiangning Road to Yichang Road, will be rerouted to turn from Jiangning Road into Kangding Road, running west along the original Route 6 line to Caojiadu, with a temporary shuttle bus on the section from the intersection of Jiangning Road and Kangding Road to Yichang Road.</p>
<h3>The Index Review Committee Passes Recommendations; Compile and Use Weekly Index; Name of Institution to Be Determined; May Be Implemented as Early as the 27th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Compilation Review Committee, according to a request from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, convened an emergency meeting. The original text briefly stated: "The indices published in recent times are very accurate and cannot be criticized. However, this kind of index is quite effective when applied to a time when the situation is peaceful and prices are stable. However, at a time when the gold yuan notes are depreciating and prices are jumping several times a day, doubling in a few days, and the currency value is gradually falling miserably and going in the opposite direction, even women and children know that if the average index is used as the standard for issuing salaries, it has lost its balance function. Now, in order to take into account the lives of workers and to ensure that monthly wage income can be maintained, it is necessary to establish a special institution to study how to link prices and wages. A separate Wage Index Compilation Review Committee should be organized as soon as possible so that prices and wages can be balanced, the lives of workers can be maintained, society can be stabilized, and production can be increased, benefiting both sides." After receiving the report, the meeting was held in the City Hall Conference Room yesterday morning, attended by Zhou Xuexiang and Sun Wenyuan of the General Labor Union, Tian Heqing, Liu Qingyi, and Cai Xintao of the Industrial Association, Yan E-sheng and Chu Shangyi of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Cao Peizi and Shen Ding of the Bureau of Social Affairs, and Zhang Chuyi, Chairman of the Municipal Statistics Office. First, the General Labor Union proposed two points: (1) Reorganize the Cost of Living Index Review Committee into a Wage and Price Review Committee. (2) The salary system and salary payment methods should be closely coordinated with the cost of living index to protect the lives of employees. After heated discussions among labor and management representatives, recommendations were passed, which will be submitted to the Economic Conference for discussion and then reported to the Municipal Government for final decision. The recommendations are recorded as follows: (1) Regarding the name of the review committee, the Municipal Government is requested to approve one of the three names: the original name of the Municipal Cost of Living Index Review Committee, the Wage and Price Review Committee, and the Salary Index Review Committee. (2) Regarding the index matters: (A) The index compilation will be changed to a weekly index, which will be published every Wednesday morning. (B) The weekly index price survey period is stipulated to be surveyed three times every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. (C) The salary index may refer to the cost of living index on each survey date and the price increases during the week, and the review committee will discuss and decide on it. The standard for the salary index will be determined separately. (D) If the Economic Conference approves the implementation of the salary index and reports it to the Municipal Government for approval, it will be implemented from April 27th.</p>
<h3>The General Labor Union's Emergency Meeting Requests Early Wage Payment; Workers of Major Bookstores Petition</h3>
<p>Because of the soaring prices and the serious threat to the lives of workers, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened an emergency executive council meeting at 5:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss this issue. In addition to requiring the government to strictly control prices, it was also proposed that workers' wages in various factories should be advanced by 50%, and that the Bureau of Social Affairs should be notified to inform all manufacturers to comply. Also, at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, representatives from the six industrial unions of the Central Printing Factory 1 and 2, Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, and Zhongzheng Bookstore petitioned the General Labor Union, requesting that future salary payments must be made by converting the base salary into silver dollars, that is, every base salary of 2 gold yuan should be converted into 1 silver yuan, in order to maintain the minimum living standards of the workers. The General Labor Union agreed to forward the request to the Bureau of Social Affairs for adoption.</p>

<h3>US Aid Rice - 300th Shipment Arrives - Ceremony Held on the Hai Su Transport Ship - Receiving the Sincere Friendship of the United States</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The 300th shipment of US aid rice, totaling 9,050 long tons, arrived in Shanghai on the Hai Su Transport Ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company the day before yesterday and docked at Pier 1 of the China Merchants Bureau. A reception ceremony was held on the ship at 10:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Zhang Zhaoyuan, a member of the US Aid Utilization Committee. Attendees included Griffin, the Deputy Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Chen Liang, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Yang Chuo'an, the Chairman of the Food Procurement and Storage Committee, Cabot, the US Consul General in Shanghai, and more than 30 representatives from various agencies. After the ceremony began, Zhang Zhaoyuan delivered a speech, stating that the Hai Su Transport Ship's arrival in Shanghai with rice was the 300th ship to transport US aid to China, which was worth commemorating. He expressed great gratitude for the help given to the Chinese people by the American people and government. To date, the value of aid materials transported to China has reached 150 million US dollars, including over 9,000 long tons of rice, which, although not a large amount, has had a significant effect on enriching the supply of food for Shanghai residents and stabilizing their psychology. As for the supply of cotton for textile mills, it directly maintains the employment of over one million workers, and the number of indirectly benefited people is even greater. Gasoline and other oil products help maintain and develop transportation and public services. Fertilizer directly helps China's agricultural production, and coal supplies urgently needed fuel for power plants and general factories. All these kinds of material assistance have been of great help. Recently, the US Senate and House of Representatives passed a bill to extend the period of US aid appropriations, allowing the remaining 54 million US aid from this US aid program to continue to be allocated to materials needed by China and the implementation of rural reconstruction plans. He expressed his deep pleasure and hoped to accept the sincere friendship of the American people and government with a spirit of self-reliance. After Zhang's speech, Griffin delivered a speech, elaborating on the significance of US aid to China, and expressed his hope that China would achieve peace and success, so that the people would no longer suffer from the pain of civil war. He also said that after the victory of the war against Japan, President Truman specially sent General Marshall to China to work hard to promote the coordination of Chinese political parties. Although it was not successful, the original intention of the United States to hope that China could end the war and restore prosperity has never changed. Subsequently, Municipal Secretary-General Chen delivered a speech, quoting the ancient Chinese saying "It is easy to add flowers to brocade, but difficult to provide charcoal in the snow," comparing the effective assistance given by the United States to China in times of great difficulty. He expressed his deep gratitude on behalf of the six million citizens of Shanghai for this pure and precious friendship. The ceremony ended at 11:00 AM, and a reception was held, with guests and hosts enjoying themselves.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Council and Other Groups Jointly Telegraph, Calling on the Communist Party to Abandon Harsh Conditions</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the 24 articles proposed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are mostly harsh and detrimental to peace talks, the Shanghai Council, General Labor Union, Educational Association, Farmers' Association, Women's Association, and other groups, for the benefit of all newspapers and fellow countrymen, hereby record the original text as follows: At a time when the government is sincerely seeking peace and the people of the whole country are eager for peace and seeking to end the war, the CCP notified the government with 24 articles, limiting the reply to the 20th. At the same time, it is also gathering troops, going back on its promise of a ceasefire, fiercely attacking the bridgehead of the National Army north of the Yangtze River, and actively preparing to cross the river to the south. The peace talks under the attention of the whole country are no less than a blow to the head. The 24 articles proposed by the CCP and its husbands are mostly harsh. For example, the members of the united government and the chairman of its decision-making committee must be selected by the CCP, which is nominally united but actually monopolized. Secondly, the national system of the Republic of China must be changed and the legal system must be abolished, which is an attempt to destroy the glorious history and cultural system of our country for thousands of years in one fell swoop, which we cannot accept. In addition, the CCP forced the National Army to reorganize according to the model of Beiping, designated Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang and other places as places for peaceful crossing of the Yangtze River, and took over the navy and air force, etc., in an attempt to cross the river without bloodshed and force the government to surrender. As for the confiscation of private capital, it clearly shows that the CCP is unwilling to abandon the violent policy of struggle and liquidation, which is deeply regrettable. It is hoped that the CCP can suddenly realize that it values the lives of the people and public opinion, immediately stop all military operations on the spot to fulfill its previous promises, and meet with sincerity to maintain the freedom of the people's lives. Both parties should agree that their troops can reorganize themselves in their respective defense zones under equal conditions, so that peace talks can continue and a comprehensive, reasonable and emotional peace can be realized. Otherwise, the responsibility for destroying peace, which is pointed out by ten fingers and watched by ten eyes, is very clear. This association and other groups are deeply concerned about the country and cannot remain silent at this critical moment of peace talks. Therefore, we specially jointly telegraph all groups and compatriots across the country to rise up together and call for a unified voice, so that under the supervision of the truly fair public opinion of our country, both parties can implement a ceasefire, tolerate each other, and save the peace talks from breaking down and the national destiny from being in danger. Then the country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate.</p>

Anyone willing to help can contact the China Welfare Fund at No. 988A, Lin Sen Middle Road, or call 70006, extension number 7.</p>

At the same time, there will be major changes to the train schedule for both lines. The new train schedule was completely finalized last night, but the implementation date has not yet been determined, because it must wait for the through train from Beijing to Guangzhou to complete its full journey and the Ministry of Transportation's Joint Transportation Office to finalize the schedule, and then incorporate the current passenger train schedule before it can be implemented.

<h3>Most of Shanghai's Fishing Transport and Fishing Boats Set Out to Sea to Fish</h3>
<p>During this peak season for yellow croaker, the garrison headquarters, in consideration of the safety of the river defense and the livelihoods of fishermen and fish merchants, has specially organized and registered fishing boats to go out to sea to catch and sell fish. The registration procedures are also stipulated to be as fast and convenient as possible, so as not to delay the fishing season. It is learned that: the Shanghai Fisheries Association, in accordance with the instructions of the garrison headquarters, is rushing to handle the matter in charge of four places, including the Jiangquan Shanghai Fisheries Transport and Fishing Boat Management Office, the Marine Product Marketing Association, and the Fisheries Association of the seven counties in northern Jiangsu. Most of them have now set out to sea to catch and sell fish. Furthermore, it is learned that the previous reports in various newspapers about the opening of the ports of Fushan and Hupu were misreported. The fishing boats there have all been moved to Liuhekou for nearby fishing in order to facilitate inspection.</p>
<h3>Wang Jinming Sentenced to Death for Defrauding the Families of Criminals</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Jinming, an unemployed vagrant, colluded with a person named Zhang Guohua between January and February this year, using the pretext of being able to find ways to bail out criminal suspects Su Youfu, Lu Gengsheng, and others detained at the First Detention Center of the District Court. He continuously defrauded the family members of the criminals, including Su Feng Guiying, Lu Asi, Chen Yang Ailan, Liu Xiaoya, Wu Xiaomei, and Huang Zhang Xingbin, of a large amount of activity fees and clothing. On February 28, at around 12:00 noon, he was encountered by Liu Xiaoya on East Changzhi Road, and she immediately reported him to the Huangpu Branch Bureau. After investigation and prosecution, the District Court concluded the trial yesterday. The court stated that although Wang took this approach due to lack of means to make a living, his targets were the families of criminals. These people relied on the fact that their husbands, brothers, and sons were in prison and eagerly hoped to regain their freedom, so they were obedient to the defendant in every possible way, allowing him to take whatever he wanted. However, the defendant specifically carried out fraud on these pitiful worms, which was truly heinous. Therefore, although the situation was pitiful, the heart was truly punishable, and he was sentenced to four years of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Through Train from Beijing to Guangzhou Enters the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Yesterday, Many Difficulties Remain for Formal Operation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The through train from Beijing to Guangzhou has successfully completed the journeys on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways and entered the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway yesterday. After passing Nanchang, it arrived at Zhangshu Town on schedule. Passengers crossed the Gan River and changed to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway train to continue their journey. The trains allocated by the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau can return to Hangzhou today. Although the Joint Transportation Office of the Ministry of Transportation has high hopes for through train service, there are many difficulties. After this trial run, it is not yet certain whether formal service can begin immediately. There are two major difficulties: (1) The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been busy with military transport recently, and the tracks are often congested by military vehicles. With the increase in passenger transport on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the through train from Beijing to Guangzhou may not be able to arrive on schedule on these two lines. (2) The passenger fares on the three lines are different and adjusted from time to time, making it impossible to set joint transportation fares. For example, on the first day the train departed from Beijing and Shanghai, the two lines immediately increased fares tenfold. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also adjusted fares the day before yesterday, and announced that they would be adjusted every five days after publication. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway's fares are even calculated in silver dollars, and the market prices of "big heads" change from morning to night. Although fares do not change as frequently as the market prices of "big heads," they may be adjusted at any time. For example, different fares have already occurred during this trial run. Yesterday, passengers crossing the Gan River were charged 10,000 yuan for the crossing fee and 90,000 yuan for the luggage fee (limited to 50 kilograms, doubled for exceeding), which was calculated according to the newly adjusted standards of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and was not included in the original fee.</p>
<h3>National Property Inventory Commission Begins Accepting People's Accusations - The Commission is Internally Divided into Five Groups</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The members of the Supervisory Yuan's National Property Inventory Commission stationed in Shanghai hosted a press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday. Members in attendance included Xiong Zaiwei, Tang Honglie, Liang Shangdong, and nine others, chaired by Xiong Zaiwei, the convener, who explained the commission's position of "striving to work with a completely fair and selfless attitude, so that the country's property can truly be taken from the people and used for the people, and not allowing anyone or any kind of power to deceive, manipulate, or control it for personal gain under the guise of public interest."</p>
<p>The internal organization of the commission is based on work objectives and is divided into five groups, with the following allocation of personnel: Commission Convener: Xiong Zaiwei. Group 1 (National Treasury Bank): Tang Honglie, Xiong Zaiwei, Hu Wenhui. Group 2 (Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange): Liang Shangdong, Chen Yunge, Ren Bingjun. Group 3 (State-Run Enterprises): Sun Yulin, Yu Zhenzhou, Wang Xiangchen. Group 4 (Enemy Puppet Property): Liu Pingjiang, Jin Yueguang, Yu Peihou. Group 5 (US Aid Materials): Gu Huangxiang, Huang Huangshi, Guo Zhongkui. (The first person in each group above is the convener of that group).</p>
<p>Regarding the investigation techniques in Shanghai, the members stated that they would be used flexibly and adapted to local conditions, so it is difficult to provide a concrete explanation. The location of the property inventory is not limited to the city of Shanghai, as this is a national issue. The focus of the investigation is not on the amount of national property, but on exposing old abuses and further imposing penalties and impeachments. The commission has begun accepting people's accusations, and as of today, a number of complaints have been received. However, the Supervisory Yuan does not respond to people's complaints in accordance with the law, nor can it provide rewards.</p>
<h3>Zhao Changgen Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment for Attempted Murder of His Brother</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhao Changgen was sentenced to five years imprisonment yesterday by Judge Zhu Chanping of the District Court for attempted murder of his brother.

Neighbors Cao Bingrong and others heard the noise and rushed over. Changgen directly admitted to the crime.

<h3>Another Anonymous Letter Received in the Decapitated Dismemberment Case, Police of District Attorney's Office Arrested People Without Success</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] During the secret investigation by the District Attorney's Office into the decapitated dismemberment case on Jinji Road, the Police Office of the District Attorney's Office suddenly received another anonymous letter yesterday morning, stating that the cruel murderer in the dismemberment case is currently hiding in a certain place on West Nanjing Road in the city, and hoping that police officers would be dispatched quickly to arrest him. After receiving the report, the Police Office of the District Attorney's Office reported to the prosecuting attorney in charge and dispatched multiple police officers to the address for inquiry. However, the address is the Zhongyuan Electrical Materials Factory, and no murderer in the case was hiding there. The prosecuting attorney now intends to list the allegations in the letter as one of the investigation clues and will periodically summon the person in charge of the factory to court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Principal Offender Arrested and Handed Over to the Garrison Headquarters in the Attempted Murder Case on Tibet Road</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On February 22 of this year, an attempted murder case occurred in front of the Oriental Hotel on Tibet Road. At that time, the victim Zhu Gengsheng was kidnapped by Qin Shibin, an acquaintance, and a group of people to Qunyu Lane nearby. They first took away his weapons and then repeatedly stabbed his hands and feet with sharp blades, and fired several shots as a warning before dispersing. After the incident, the police station immediately sent personnel to investigate and successively arrested three suspects, Xu Jinshan, Chen Genlin, and Lin Amao, who have been sent to the District Attorney's Office for interrogation. As for the principal offender Qin Shibin, the police station did not receive a tip-off until the 7th of this month and arrested him at No. 4, Lane 224, Qufu Road. After interrogation, he directly admitted to the murder. However, due to the seriousness of the circumstances, the police station will transfer him to the garrison headquarters for punishment in accordance with military law.</p>
<h3>Three Defendants Given Lighter Sentences in the Case of Attempting to Embezzle Enemy and Puppet Ironware</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Song Zhen was a plainclothes police officer at the Xinshi Street Police Branch in the city, Zuo Dihua was the police chief of the branch, and Xu Ruyun was the head of the first unit of the twelfth district in the branch's jurisdiction. There were many scrap iron shovels, iron bars, etc. near Xu's residence when the enemy and puppets surrendered. Later, Xu gathered the scrap iron in a thatched shed without a house number at No. 470 Lane on the road, which was kept by resident Zhuang Jinlong. However, it was not reported to the主管機關(zhuguan jiguan, roughly translated to authorities in charge), and was later learned by Zuo, who introduced Li Rujin to Xu to negotiate the sale, but it was unsuccessful. On April 10 of last year, Xin Yuekang, a small contractor, needed iron shovels for organizing the venue for the National Games and attempted to buy them, so Zuo introduced Xu to bring a number of workers to carry them. Local residents tried to stop them, but Zhuang went to report to Xu, who arrived on the scene and explained Song's identity, claiming that the iron shovels were being transported by the police bureau's car. The onlookers dispersed, and Xin transported the iron shovels away by truck. On the third day, Xu invited Song and Zuo to Xin's place. Xin first gave Song 500 法幣(Fabii, currency at the time), which Song转交(zhuanjiao, handed over) to Xu. After Xu left, Song and Zuo took another 3,500 yuan from Xin. The incident was later discovered by the Municipal Police Bureau, which transferred the case to the District Court for trial in accordance with the Special Cases Litigation Regulations. They were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Later, the defendants applied for retrial, and the Supreme Court of Shanghai sent the case back for retrial. The District Court has now concluded the trial again, stating that their crime of embezzlement is extremely clear. 自主財物(zizhu caiwu, independently managed properties/belongings), the greed for small profits, and the occasional violation of criminal law, after reviewing the circumstances of the crime, it is still excusable. The court has specially reduced their sentences by one-half, each reducing their sentences to three years and six months of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>The Fundraising Results of the Poor Children's Work-Study Institute are Very Good</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute held an all-day radio fundraising campaign on Children's Day, and the results were very good. The collection of donations has now been completed, but it is regrettable that the addresses of some donors are unknown, or the names and addresses match but they did not call to donate. This type of situation is probably due to miscommunication over the phone. The institute hopes that donors can send their donations to the institute's office at No. 354 West Nanjing Road, Daguan Society, or call 37646. It is also learned that the biggest gain from this fundraising campaign was that the Lu Genji Construction Factory generously donated all the tiles for building houses.</p>
<h3>Two Criminals Arrested for Specializing in Stealing Bicycles - Confessed to More Than Ten Cases</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Songshan Road Police Branch recently received a report that two habitual thieves known as "Killer Quick Horse," Zhu Youwei and Sun Xinglong, lived at No. 5 Daren Lane, Fuxing Middle Road. Section Chief Zhong ordered police officers to rush to the location, and they arrested the two criminals and brought them to the bureau. According to their confessions, they committed 11 bicycle thefts in Shanghai between August of last year and January of this year. In addition, they also stole four bicycles in Hangzhou. Based on the confessions of the two criminals, they recovered six stolen bicycles and a large number of parts from four locations, including Zhang Bonan's home at No. 4 Tangjia Lane, Jinji Road, the Kuaili Bicycle Shop at No. 150 Fuxing Middle Road, Wu Fusheng's home at No. 246 Jianguo West Road, and Yang Tailong's residence at No. 26, Lane 478, Xie Xu Road.</p>

<h3>He Yugan Military Academy Cadre Returns After Desertion, Bitterly Hates Jia Yibin, Tears Flowing in the Wind and Snow</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Jianxiong</p>
<p>[Our Paper, Jiaxing, 17th Dispatch] The First Corps of the Pre-cadre Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, stationed in Jiaxing, had some cadets who deserted freely on the evening of the 6th of this month. This not only caused alarm among the people of Jiaxing, but also aroused concern throughout the country. Everyone knows that the predecessor of the Pre-cadre Corps was the patriotic and intellectual youth who responded to the call of the leader "100,000 Youth to Join the Army" during the war. They had an indelible "glorious history" on the Burma Road during the War of Resistance. After the victory and return, under the leadership of Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo, they were forged to be stronger and more decisive. Because they have been stationed in Jiaxing for more than four years, they are regarded by the people as the only "model soldiers" in China. This sudden and unfortunate incident has indeed been of concern to the people of the whole country. Although the incident has now been successfully resolved, readers may not fully understand the causes and consequences of this incident. For this reason, our reporter visited General Xu Sixian, Director of the Pre-cadre Bureau, and Li Tianduo, the Corps Commander who returned after deserting, and the cadets, respectively. The process and current situation are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Launching the Incident</p>
<p>"The cadets were completely deceived and have no responsibility. Jia Yibin cannot shirk his responsibility." This is what Director Xu and Corps Commander Li said first when talking to reporters. From this, we can understand that the cause of this incident was only Jia Yibin. So, who is Jia Yibin? He is the former Director of the Pre-cadre Bureau and concurrently the Corps Commander of the First Corps, a native of Hubei, about forty years old. This person has petty cleverness but no great wisdom. During his tenure, he used the enthusiasm and frustration of young people, used "democracy" as a cover to deceive students, and attempted to use students as personal tools. He was usually extreme in his words and deeds, and used slogans to cater to the youth to incite and win the favor of the cadets. Since the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, he has been deeply poisoned by defeatism, and his attitude and words and deeds have become more obvious. He was transferred to the Ministry of National Defense for review and dismissed from his post, and transferred to serve in the Nanjing Garrison Command. Instead of reflecting on his mistakes, he became angry and resentful, and secretly arranged for his confidants, hoping to wait for an opportunity to act. Recently, when the Communist Party deployed troops on the banks of the Yangtze River, he thought the time was ripe and hoped to dominate the area. He sneaked into Jiaxing and hid in the countryside to plan a rebellion.</p>
<p>Secretly Planning a Rebellion in Jiaxing</p>
<p>Jia came to Jiaxing in plain clothes on the 2nd and secretly gathered his confidants. The original plan was to launch the rebellion on the 16th. So why did he act hastily on the evening of the 6th? There are two reasons why he could not carry out the original plan calmly. First, the Pre-cadre Corps had been ordered to be stationed in Fuzhou, and everything was being actively prepared. Second, his actions on the afternoon of the 6th had been discovered by the current Corps Commander Li Tianduo. Because Li was kind-hearted, he believed that he had been with Jia for many years and had a deep personal relationship. Therefore, he asked someone to inform him that he wanted to persuade him and tell him the righteousness and the stakes. However, Jia knew that the matter had been exposed and replied, "There is no need to come to see me, I will come to see him." Therefore, without waiting for Li to meet him, he decided to launch the rebellion ahead of schedule. This was at six o'clock on the evening of the 6th.</p>
<p>The Evening of Coercing the Desertion</p>
<p>At this time, Corps Commander Li was discussing all matters concerning the relocation of the corps to Fuzhou with Deputy Corps Commander Pan and Corps Adjutant Qi in the office. Jia's confidants had secretly deployed armed guards around the office. First, one or two so-called "representatives" asked Corps Commander Li, "What is the future of our corps?" Soon, Jia also entered the room, and the external security was further strengthened, and the situation suddenly became tense. After Jia sat down, he talked to Li about trivial matters. Then, more than a dozen cadets broke into the room and reported to Li, "Now we are ready to do it, listen to the opinions of the Corps Commander and Deputy Corps Commander." Li asked, "What exactly do you want to do?" Their answer was, "Only go to the mountains!" Li asked again, "Is there no other way to go besides going to the mountains? Now the government wants us to go to Fuzhou, isn't this the right way? You should study it." At that time, Jia said sternly, "Only do this, it must be done this way." At that time, Li and others all expressed their disapproval. Jia then pulled out the original planned marching map, and while monitoring Li and others, he falsely issued Corps Commander Li's order to "implement combat readiness march," ordering each company to carry all guns, ammunition, bedding and equipment and wait for departure.</p>
<p>At that time, it was close to midnight, and most of the cadets woke up in a daze, not knowing the truth, and were deceived by him. However, the 15th and 16th teams (i.e., the political work team and the transportation team) became suspicious because the order came suddenly and refused to follow. When Jia heard the news, he was taking Corps Commander Li to persuade them. Halfway there, he turned back because of lack of time and hurriedly coerced Corps Commander Li to lead more than 1,600 cadets to Wuzhen. Pan and Qi took the opportunity to escape at this time.</p>
<p>Major Riot Among Cadets</p>
<p>Their team arrived in Tongxiang on the 7th. Most of the cadets were exhausted from the long journey and had not eaten, so they complained. At the same time, Corps Commander Li, who was being monitored, took the opportunity to reveal the news and persuaded the cadets to return to the team. Therefore, some deliberately fell behind and sneaked back. In the evening, the team arrived in Wuzhen, which belongs to Huzhou. Jia then gathered the cadets to speak, vaguely revealing that the destination was to break away from all fetters. He thought this would encourage morale, but it backfired. Once the secret was revealed, the cadets immediately rioted. Seeing that the situation was not good, Jia threatened and intimidated them, saying, "You will be killed if you go back." Therefore, the cadets were filled with resentment and terror, and they were in a dilemma. The troops continued to advance, but were blocked by the local team. They detoured and took the wrong route, and clashed with the blocking team. Also, because there were many cadets and the line was long, the team was extremely chaotic. Jia knew that there would be danger, so he went on a boat alone. The cadets who were monitoring Corps Commander Li also abandoned their mission for the sake of their own safety. So Li took this opportunity to escape and return. At the same time, about 500 cadets returned on the evening of the 8th. At this time, Jia Yibin was doomed to failure.</p>
<p>The Rebellion Was Successfully Resolved</p>
<p>As for the headquarters, Deputy Corps Commander Pan and Corps Adjutant Qi contacted the 11th Traffic Police Corps stationed in Jiaxing after escaping and sent personnel to pursue and suppress them. At the same time, they telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense for instructions and discussed solutions with the Zhejiang Provincial Garrison Headquarters and the China Youth Corps and other agencies. General Xu Sixian, Director of the Pre-cadre Bureau, also came to Jiaxing on the 8th to sit in the Corps Headquarters and contacted the counties by telephone to personally request assistance in comforting and suppressing the rebellion. The government authorities knew that most of the cadets who deserted this time were deceived. In addition to sending troops to pursue and intercept them, they also sent planes to distribute leaflets to clarify the truth and explain the righteousness. The China Youth Corps also sent important personnel to shout near Mount Mogan, explaining the government's intentions. At this time, more than 700 cadets who went to the mountains, after the truth was revealed, went down the mountains to await the government's disposal. Therefore, the successful resolution of this incident was not only due to Director Xu's tireless day and night command and the effective comfort and suppression of the provincial and county teams, but also due to the fact that the leaflets distributed by the planes and the shouts of the China Youth Corps personnel were really helpful.</p>
<p>The Fate of Jia Yibin</p>
<p>Most of the cadets who were deceived by Jia Yibin have returned. As of now, the corps has 2,239 cadets, only 131 less than the original number of 2,493 (excluding 133 who were sent to the hospital due to illness or injury). About 50 people were killed or injured in this incident, and some cadets were discouraged and returned home after this encounter. According to the recent return of the cadets, "Jia Yibin only brought a dozen or twenty people, all of whom have changed into plain clothes. Jia also told these dozen or twenty people about his fate, saying: (1) You will beat me to death. (2) I can only commit suicide. (3) You will not send me to the garrison headquarters." From this, it can be seen that it will not be difficult to capture Jia Yibin in the short term.</p>
<p>Reorganization Completed and Classes Resume</p>
<p>After Corps Commander Li returned, he suffered great stimulation this time and suffered a nervous breakdown. He is currently recuperating. The reorganization of the troops and the handling of the aftermath are temporarily presided over by General Xu Sixian, Director of the Pre-cadre Bureau. According to Xu, the initial reorganization has been completed. There were originally four battalions and sixteen companies. Currently, three battalions have been formed, and the reorganization will be completed soon. However, many guns and bedding were lost in this incident. In addition to setting up a bonus system to ask the counties to help collect them, personnel were sent to Wuxing, Deqing, Tongxiang and other counties to investigate the casualties and the loss of weapons, and to properly handle them separately. The Ministry of National Defense was also telegraphed to request remedy. Therefore, classes will resume from the 25th and training will be carried out according to the original plan. The cadets who returned after deserting this time all felt remorse and even cried bitterly."</p>

<h3>Chicken with Four Feet Moves Quickly</h3>
<p>Will be sent to Jinshan People's Education Center</p>
<p>[Our Paper, Jinshan, 17th Dispatch] Hu Hengchang, the owner of the Hu Qiangyi fish shop in Dongshi Town, Songyin, Jinshan County, raised a hen. On the afternoon of the 16th, it hatched fifteen chicks. It was found that one of the chicks was yellow in color and had four feet, resembling a frog. The anus was located on the abdomen, and it moved very quickly. Food excretion was normal. It caused a sensation in the town, and the audience was amazed. Now, the Songyin Town Office has been informed to raise it properly and will purchase it and send it to the Jinshan County People's Education Center for exhibition for biologists to study.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Levies Self-Defense Donations</h3>
<p>[Our Paper, Zhenjiang, 18th Dispatch] The counties in the First Pacification District were previously ordered to levy special self-defense donations. Commander Ding Zhipan recently sent an urgent telegram to the jurisdiction, limiting all to be completed before April 25. In addition, supplementary measures were formulated based on the previously promulgated detailed rules for fundraising and expenditure, and distributed to the counties for compliance. The main points of these supplementary measures are as follows: (1) The special self-defense donations payable by natural persons may be paid in kind (rice) according to the actual situation of the donor. Corporations and legally adjusted tax rates shall still be converted into gold yuan coupons in principle. (2) The collection of in-kind payments shall designate a proxy treasury (Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank) to receive, set up warehouses for storage. (3) The counties shall notify donors to pay directly to the treasury, whether in-kind or in gold yuan coupons. (4) If the donor pays in silver dollars, the proxy treasury shall convert it at the current exchange rate.</p>
<h3>100 Meters of Land, 1,000 Piculs of Rice, 30 Taels of Gold Changzhou National Taxation Bureau Accused of Corruption</h3>
<p>[Our Paper, Wujin, 18th Dispatch] Sun Mingshu, Director of the County National Taxation Bureau, was originally the Director of the Goods Tax Bureau. He usually relied on his strong background (rumored to be the nephew of a certain party elder) and often traveled between Beijing and Shanghai. When the National Assembly was held that year, he conspired to become a staff member of the meeting place, swayed back to Changzhou with a red satin strip from the county, and frequented restaurants, flaunting himself in front of people, looking like a delegate of the National Assembly. His boring appearance made people laugh. Later, the Direct Tax Bureau and the Goods Tax Bureau were merged into the National Taxation Bureau, and Sun took advantage of the opportunity to become the Director, arbitrarily placed his cronies, and excluded dissidents, which once caused major disputes. Recently, he was accused by Liu Shounian, a citizen of this county, of four points of corruption and dereliction of duty and sued to the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Office. The facts are approximately as follows: (1) In October of last year, Director Sun heard that the liquor tax would increase tenfold, so on October 1, he sent Han Jinkun, the Secretary of the Bureau, to Zhenjiang to inquire. On the 2nd, he returned and reported. Sun immediately summoned the rice merchants of the Yixing branch to give face-to-face instructions. On the same day, he contacted the liquor merchants to pay the prepaid tax in advance, colluding with each other to obtain private profit of 20,000 gold yuan (equivalent to 1,000 piculs of rice). After being reported, the Ministry of Finance sent the inspector Zhou Keming to Changzhou to investigate thoroughly. Sun Mingshu gave Zhou Keming 2,000 gold yuan coupons, and the matter ended uneventfully. (2) Wan An, an employee of the Bureau, never came to the office to work and had another job outside. He was paid a salary in the Bureau in name only. (3) On September 25 of last year, Director Sun celebrated his birthday in a big way. The entire Bureau stopped working for two days and went to Wuxi for fun, under the pretext of congratulating him. (4) In handling the profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the first half of the 37th year, he colluded with the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce to fraudulently collect an additional tax of 360,000 gold yuan, equivalent to 30 taels of gold. Because the Wujin Chamber of Commerce has always followed the tax collection in Wuxi, Wuxi calculated the tax at 200 times the 36th year, while Changzhou calculated the tax at 60 times, seeking private gain and engaging in malpractice, which was known to everyone in the entire Bureau. ... The indictment clearly points out the names, dates, and months, which are very credible. The Supervisory Office has telegraphed Wujin County to investigate and verify the case nearby. The county government sent Section Chief Zhu of the Finance Section to conduct the investigation. The inside story is turbulent, and rumors are rife. According to people familiar with the situation, the National Taxation Bureau also has many problems with tobacco and alcohol taxes.</p>
<h3>On the Art of Employing People</h3>
<p>— Xu Daolin</p>
<p>The year before last, when I returned from Taiwan, I met Mr. Chen Guangfu. I told him that there was great potential for tourism in Taiwan, and advised him to start working on it quickly. He said that it was not that he did not know how to do it, nor that he did not want to do it, but that he did not have the right people yet. This sentence fully expressed that he was a person in the business, and made me even more clear why his business was successful.</p>
<p>I know a few contemporary giants. They are indeed loyal to the country and work hard day and night. They all hold several important positions and spend the whole day attending meetings, giving instructions, giving speeches, attending ceremonies, and receiving foreign guests. They are already very busy, but their desks are piled with piles of official documents, waiting for them to approve them one by one, and sometimes they even have to revise them word by word. The waiting room is full of guests waiting to see them, each patiently waiting there with newspapers and magazines. The most difficult thing is their group of high-ranking subordinates, each with their briefcases full of so-called "most important" official documents, chasing from the office to the meeting place, and from the meeting place to the residence, waiting for their approval. Sometimes, such a hard chase and wait lasts for three or five days, but still cannot catch these adults in a relatively free time, because they are at some venue talking about their great economic ideals and their philosophical concepts.</p>
<p>To say that they do not want to do well, they are followers of ideology and ardent patriots. To say that they are not working hard, they eat little and do many things, and each of them is highly overworked. But why are they still unable to achieve anything? This is because they only know how to do things but do not know how to employ people. The ancient saying "A wise ruler makes seeking talent his business" is not something their brains can comprehend.</p>
<p>Some more enlightened dignitaries seem to understand the importance of "seeking talent." They are indeed consulting widely and seeking talent everywhere. They will admire your high reputation and will not hesitate to condescend to visit you. When you come, they will greet you with open arms, give you the seat of honor at dinner, and offer you wine diligently. They will give you high positions, honorable titles, and rich gifts. They may even entrust you with an important position and give you full power. But their reason for employing you is not to seek talent for the country's cause, but to consider their personal status. They do not want to give you the opportunity to develop your ambitions, but to bring you in to decorate their facade. Before long, they will either feel that you are not obedient enough, somewhat obstructive, or fear that your wings are gradually growing and you cannot be controlled. As a result, they will become estranged and discriminatory, and then discriminate and exclude you. In the end, it will always end in an unhappy breakup. The ancient books say that it is difficult to become prosperous and difficult to obtain talent, it is difficult to use talent, and it is difficult to entrust talent. This is exactly the reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first element of the success of historical figures is to know people and make good use of them. Knowing means being able to know people, and making good use of them means being able to employ people. But those who know people may not be able to employ people, and those who can employ people must know people. Those who are good at employing people can discover the strengths of each person and will find opportunities for them to发挥 them—there is no one in the world who is completely without strengths, and there is no one who does not want to发挥 their strengths. Those who are good at employing people know how to increase the work interest of each person, know how to increase the work ability of each person, and know how to increase the cohesiveness of the entire group. Therefore, those who rely on changing personnel to reorganize their business are certainly correct, but those who can use the original personnel, without adding new people, without expelling people, only relying on the allocation of work and the application of rewards and punishments, and can turn the bad into good and the useless into useful, so-called embracing everything and making the best use of talent, and can change the atmosphere and improve efficiency, this can truly be considered someone who knows how to employ people.</p>
<p>People who know how to employ people must have the wisdom to know people. How easy is it to know people! But there is also a secret, which is to cultivate the wisdom to know people, and must strive to break inherent prejudices. And one's inherent prejudices must be based on selfish interests. In other words, the selfish cannot know people, and to know people, one must first restrain oneself. A truly talented person knows everyone, but sometimes does not know, because they are unwilling to know, so they do not know. This is one point. Furthermore, it is absolutely not easy to know the quality of talent, but it is extremely easy to know it relatively. As the saying goes, "One is not afraid of not knowing the goods, but of being afraid that the goods cannot be compared." But in general, those who employ people are unwilling to put in the effort in this one word "compare," and still say that talent is hard to come by. How can one not sigh! This is the second point. Also, how is a person's talent? Words are not proof, and one test will reveal it. The so-called "true gold is not afraid of fire." A person who knows how to seek talent for the cause will not be stingy in giving people a chance to show their skills. Yao tested Shun with the world, let alone the rest! This is the third point.</p>
<p>People who know how to employ people must also have a virtue, which is the concept of helping others to succeed. Our purpose in employing a person is to cultivate him, not to help me. Our purpose in teaching him to do something is for the sake of the thing itself, not for the sake of my interests. If we employ people with such a starting point, how can people not work hard and devote their lives? Bo Le saw the thousand-mile horse under the salt cart and cried bitterly, and the thousand-mile horse also wailed in pain, because Bo Le loved the horse, and was not a horse dealer who exploited the horse for profit.</p>
<p>Finally, those who can achieve great things, that is, those who are best at employing people, must also possess one condition, which is the ability to tolerate others, and the magnanimity to allow others to develop as much as possible without feeling wary. (That is, what Yangming said, "the ability to tolerate everything, and the heart to compete with no one"). This magnanimity is also another side of indifference. However, true indifference not only sees fame, wealth, and power as dim, but also sees achievements as dim, and it is still obscured, and will still be obscured by things. However, indifference is not negativity. The opposite of indifference is enthusiasm. Those who are distraught when they do not see their ruler for three months cannot be called indifferent. Indifference is also not coldness, because indifference does not hinder ambition, and it has absolute right and wrong. However, those who love great achievements and hate evil like an enemy cannot be called indifferent, because "love," "like," and "hate like an enemy" all move one's spirit and will, and therefore cannot become indifferent. Regardless of how the situation and environment change, whether it is success or failure, good times or bad times, one does not forget oneself when one is successful, and does not become frustrated when one is unsuccessful. The emotions and will in one's heart are always as calm as ever. This is true indifference.</p>
<p>There are many types of people, some are witty, some are steady, some are brave, some are cautious, some are virtuous, and some are capable. Those who are strong in this must be weak in that. Making friends mostly requires that one's personalities are compatible, but when employing people, one must never stubbornly establish boundaries and be partial. One must clearly recognize the environment and be practical. One must truly "seek people for the sake of things" in order to achieve "making the best use of people."</p>
<p>People's strengths are different, and the needs of the environment are also different. Regarding the standards for employing people now, I believe that those in high positions must value integrity. As for the talent for governing affairs, I believe that one should possess four conditions: 1. Insight, 2. Method, 3. Integrity, and 4.魄力(Po Li: courage and decisiveness). It is best if all four conditions can be met. If one cannot meet all four, I believe that insight is more important than method, method is more important than integrity, and integrity is more important than魄力(Po Li). Those who possess all four and can also know how to support the younger generation and nurture talent, and engage in the work of cultivating people and trees, are even more worthy of being the best among people.</p>
<p>Some people work hard but have very poor abilities, and some people have abilities but are unwilling to work hard. Between the two, we should of course reward those who work hard and dismiss those who are unwilling to work hard. However, those who are good at employing people will definitely put in effort in this situation, research the reasons why he is unwilling to work hard, and try to correct them. Because he knows that a person's desire to seek use and seek knowledge is his good ability, and there is no difference between it and a person's desire to survive. (End)</p>
<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>— Observer from the Stands</p>
<p>Silver Dollars Flow Back to the Central Bank; Employees Subsidize Interest for Two Days</p>
<p>For the past two days, the Central Bank has been actively working to recall silver dollars.</p>
<p>The silver dollars that flowed out during the pay period have been secretly and actively collected back in the past two days.</p>
<p>In the future, the index will be announced weekly, making it even more hectic for manufacturers to secure funds for payroll. Therefore, the Central Bank preparing silver dollar reserves has also become a routine matter.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's task of preparing silver dollars is the most difficult of all its official duties. This is because the amount required for military salaries is unimaginably large. What is released to commercial firms in this city is just a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>The quantity of silver dollars needed by the Central Bank is particularly large, making its task of collecting them especially arduous. The skill lies in collecting silver dollars without causing their price to rise.</p>
<p>Over the past two days, the Central Bank has demonstrated its skill very well.</p>
<p>News keeps coming in: Previously, it was widely claimed that the Ministry of Finance had purchased a large amount of gold from the United States, which had already been shipped to Shanghai. Yesterday, it was again widely claimed that the Ministry of Finance had purchased a large amount of silver from the United Kingdom, which had already arrived.</p>
<p>The Central Bank has been able to secure cooperation from the press to announce news favorable to controlling the market, whether true or false, which is always good.</p>
<p>Therefore, let me also make an effort: [The Central Bank has received a large shipment of gold; the Central Bank has received a large shipment of silver. The gold is to be released into the market, and the silver is to be minted into silver dollars. Specifically, it is to mint Yuan Shikai-head dollars]. But I must declare that I am only acting as a mouthpiece and cannot be held responsible, because I myself do not believe it.</p>
<p>Our efforts are having an effect. Not only have general commodity prices not risen in the past two days, but interest rates have even increased. Silver dollars, on the other hand, have had their interest subsidized for two days.</p>
<p>Those buying silver dollars should not be anxious. With weekly pay periods, there will be at least one day each week when the subsidized interest can be fully recovered, with some profit to be made. However, you must hold onto the silver dollars and wait for this opportunity.</p>
<p>If you sell them as soon as you get them, of course, you will be secretly suppressed and forced to sell at a lower price.</p>
<p>However, those who buy silver dollars with their wages have no choice but to sell them as soon as they get them, so suppressing and buying them up is a sure thing.</p>
<p>In the past, when the Central Bank squeezed small merchants, it would buy up the IOUs of shaky firms at discounted prices. It was severely criticized by the business community and has now become much more sensible, openly declaring "this will not happen again"!</p>
<p>However, if soft tactics cannot be turned into hard ones, the existence of the Central Bank loses its meaning.</p>
<p>The silver dollars in the hands of wage earners have now become the target of attack. The performance of the past two days has been quite successful.</p>
<p>Wage earners are the weak, a scattered bunch, not comparable to wealthy merchants who cannot be bullied!</p>
<p>You see: The labor sector is demanding to be paid in silver dollars. However, the current approach is to announce the index weekly, which means: take gold yuan. Therefore, the issuance rate of gold yuan has been well-arranged.</p>
<p>Indeed, once military salaries are paid in silver dollars, it is impossible to change course midway. Otherwise, there would be an uproar.</p>
<p>I greatly admire the Central Bank's success in controlling the silver dollar market over the past two days. However, I always feel concerned for the Central Bank, holding my breath. Because it is not easy for a clever housewife to maintain things for long without rice to cook. The Central Bank is more skilled than a clever housewife and can cook without rice.</p>

<h3>The Strange and Complicated Evolution of the Case of Drug Trafficking Ring Cracked in Qingdao: Huang Gongru Sends a Letter to Our Newspaper's Reporter Expressing Profound Grief, Stating This Case Involves Issues of Morality, Reason, and Conscience</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Qingdao Correspondent on the 15th] Huang Gongru, formerly the Chief of Staff of the Qingdao Garrison Headquarters, currently a Senior Advisor in the Sui Region, sent a letter to our newspaper's reporter regarding the corruption of personnel in the Qingdao Garrison Headquarters as reported by our newspaper on the 2nd and 5th of this month, offering explanations in extremely mournful language. The letter roughly stated, "The case of fraud at the Xiaogang Inspection Station on March 12th was initially very simple. Upon discovery, punishments were carried out according to the law, and guilt was assigned where it belonged. However, after repeated evolutions, some people ultimately used clandestine (original) means to distort right and wrong, to exclude dissidents, to shield relatives and personal interests, and to use it as an excuse to harm the loyal and good, thus creating a bizarre and complicated situation that cannot be properly resolved." The letter also directly pointed out that the news released by the reporter had "caused significant errors and responsibility for inaccurate reporting. However, the case's circumstances are tortuous and changes are strange and sudden, and even those involved can scarcely understand the entire process. It is difficult for you to obtain sufficient materials when interviewing for news, so you should not be overly blamed. I am the Chief of Staff Huang who, out of suspicion, ordered the inspection of the Yuan Feng Company, obtained evidence, and was the first to expose this case of corruption and fraud. Because of pressure, and under orders to handle the matter in a way that minimizes its impact, I proceeded with the handling. In the end, I disagreed with this method of prioritizing private interests over public duty and angered a group of selfish petty people. They then conspired, fabricated schemes, and falsely accused me of being a suspect. The Deputy Commander Xiang Chuan Yuan (Reporter's Note: Deputy Commander of the Garrison Headquarters) dealt me an unexpected blow, forcing me to leave my post. In the end, there was no evidence, no reason. Although I have left, a perfunctory resolution is still difficult to achieve; only keeping the matter secret will not solve the problem." The letter further stated, "The evolution of this case to this day is not merely a matter of law, but also involves issues of people's morality, reason, natural justice, and conscience, that is, whether there is still truth, justice, good, evil, right, and wrong in this society? It is a test. I am the first to be sacrificed in this multitude of contradictions. I am silently watching the consequences of this case." The letter also made the following three corrections: "(1) The report on the 5th stating that Chief of Staff Huang's order to inspect the Yuan Feng Company was indeed correct, because that company was a drug trafficking organization for bandits, and it was the firm receiving funds from the bandit region. The corruption and fraud at the Xiaogang Inspection Station was also exposed because of this. So, from this, it can be known that I am the whistleblower of the case, not a suspect. ... (2) The case occurred in Xiaogang, the corrupt organization was the inspection station, and the main culprit was the station chief, Yu Jingcheng. The case itself has nothing to do with the officers in the Garrison Headquarters. Those outside the Garrison Headquarters who colluded with Station Chief Yu in committing the crime are now reversing the priorities, as if Zhang Tong's responsibility is serious, but in reality, it is not. (3) I have resigned three times already. I submitted my resignation request as early as February 9th. Although Deputy Commander Xiang agreed to forward it, the commanding officer did not approve it. The lesson this time is that I would rather die than continue to do this. Commander Liu issued an order to transfer me back to the Sui Region to continue in my original position. Although the timing is coincidental, no superior would ever transfer an officer suspected of corruption to a senior management position in a governing department during a concurrent job opportunity. As for the so-called 'has already been placed under surveillance,' frankly speaking, there is some absurd recording." (Reporter's Note: The reporter's report was based on information disclosed by relevant parties. More than a month has passed since the case occurred, and the authorities have not yet issued any official statements. The original letter is published above.)</p>

Xue Mingjian and Sun Xiangfeng, members of the Legislative Yuan from Wuxi, have sent a letter to Premier He of the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters be ordered to transfer the case to the judiciary for handling as soon as possible to uphold the protection of human rights, as the case has not been publicly processed.</p>

<h3>Introducing the Medical Aid Society for Acute Illnesses (3)</h3>
<p>Answering Reader Inquiries and Requesting Enthusiastic Donations from Caring Individuals</p>
<p>(4) Application Procedures</p>
<p>If a citizen suddenly suffers from one of the acute illnesses listed above, they can be directly taken to the society's designated hospitals for treatment. If, after diagnosis, it is deemed necessary to provide emergency treatment and the case meets the society's regulations, the hospital should provide treatment regardless of whether the patient's family is able to afford the treatment costs. Therefore, the patient's family can, upon admission, ask the hospital to fill out the society's printed form within the prescribed time limit of 24 hours and notify the society by phone. Whether applying for aid or applying for a guarantee, the same procedure must be followed.</p>
<p>(5) Aid Levels</p>
<p>The level of aid is determined by the society based on the patient's actual circumstances. If the family is impoverished and truly unable to pay, full aid will be provided. If they are able to afford part of the cost, the society will provide partial aid to supplement the shortfall. If the patient's family does not wish to accept aid but only a temporary loan, the society also has loan provisions. No interest is charged on the loan, and it can be paid in installments.</p>

<h3>National Banks Unrestrictedly Selling Gold Off-Market, Gold Prices Fluctuating Between Solid and Flat Yesterday, On-Market Trading Disconnected from Off-Market, Unable to Conduct Business</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The gold market was calm yesterday, with prices fluctuating between solid and flat. On-market trading remained stagnant, still stuck at the 8.71 million upper limit as usual. Off-market spot trading was subdued due to heavy pressure from the Central Bank, with large dealers remaining inactive and buying interest tepid. Entrusted to Da Desheng and Zhao Fengchang Gold Shops, trading opened with a restrictive sale at 12.8 million, but due to lack of interest, prices were dropped to 12.2 million, selling approximately 200 bars, stabilizing sentiment. The morning opened flat, at 11.8 million and 12.3 million, reaching as high as 12.4 million and 12.7 million. Near noon, due to high after-hours interest rates and continued large-scale reverse flow of Hong Kong gold, supply was ample. Fearing the financial reform plan, various parties frequently sold, dropping to 11.7 million and 12 million at the noon close. In the afternoon, due to overnight trading, interest rates increased by 200 to 250 yuan, opening at 14.5 million and 15 million, reaching as high as 14.7 million and 15 million. Midway, the Central Bank continued to sell gold in large quantities at 14.8 million, dropping to 14.5 million, with few buyers, only selling a dozen or so bars, gradually dropping to 14.3 million and 14.6 million, eventually closing at 14.4 million and 14.7 million in the evening. As a result, prices fell back by 100,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Off-market futures trading opened in the morning at 13 million and 13.5 million, reaching as high as 13.9 million and 14.2 million, dropping to as low as 12.7 million and 13.2 million, closing at 13.3 million and 13.6 million at noon. In the afternoon, intraday trading opened at 13 million and 13.5 million, reaching as high as 13.3 million and 13.6 million, dropping to as low as 12.7 million and 13 million, eventually closing at 13 million and 13.3 million, rebounding by 2.6 million compared to the previous day. Interest rates for overnight long and short positions opened low by 20 yuan, at 260 yuan and 280 yuan, with the settlement price for the difference money at 16 million.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The gold market, which opened not long ago, has seen an increasingly wide gap between on-market and off-market prices in recent days due to the constraint of a 20% upper limit on on-market price increases. Furthermore, with high after-hours interest rates, a 20% daily increase limit only equates to a daily interest rate of 200 yuan, making an upper limit an inevitable trend. As a result, the market has been stagnant for nearly a week. The Central Bank has currently agreed to improve market rules, but the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued approval, so on-market trading exists in name only.</p>
<p>Recently, various parties have expressed suspicion regarding the Central Bank's large-scale gold sales off-market through Da Desheng and Zhao Fengchang Gold Shops. This reporter specifically inquired about this matter with the person in charge of Zhao Fengchang Gold Shop. The shop and Da Desheng act as agents for the Central Bank's gold sales. The Central Bank has a permanent supervisor every day who handles the matter together. Regarding prices, they consult with the Central Bank's Operations Bureau at any time, reporting sales as they occur, with absolutely no irregularities, and only taking a commission of one-thousandth, he said.</p>
<h3>The Shorts Launch a Counterattack, the Bullish Sentiment on Chinese Stocks Has Subsided</h3>
<p>Due to the sudden dimming of hopes for peace talks, the bullish trend in Chinese stocks over the past few days has gradually subsided. Moreover, Ye Zhong's tight monetary policy has not eased, with after-hours interest rates at approximately 1 yuan per 1,000 yuan, making it difficult to borrow money, and sentiment has weakened. Large "short" sellers seized the opportunity to resist pressure, so the morning market was difficult to stabilize, and the afternoon market showed weakness.</p>
<p>Yong Yarn opened high at 120 yuan, once reaching as high as 123 yuan after opening, but it was short-lived and soon returned to a downward trend, hovering for about an hour. It repeatedly showed signs of fatigue and rising, but was still suppressed by the strong force of the shorts. At 11:30, interest rates were released, reaching as high as 135 yuan and 145 yuan, and sentiment suddenly became weak. Large dealer No. 13 took the lead in initiating selling, and Nos. 135, 145, and 169 also collectively followed, with the market retreating in a straight line, reaching as low as 106 yuan. Near the close, No. 13 covered shorts and went long, pulling the price up to close at 111 yuan. The government gold bonds reached the upper limit, seeing the highest price of 4,177,200 yuan. The remaining stock markets all showed a trend of solid at first but then weak.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Reaching Repeated Peaks</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks reached repeated peaks. Yesterday, the market saw new highs, with Ewo Yarns bought at 270,000 and sold at 290,000, a gain of 35,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>British American Tobacco was bought at 310,000 and sold at 330,000, a rise of 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Ewo Brewery was bought at 50,000 and sold at 53,000, a gain of 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Yip Kee was bought unilaterally at 90,000, matching the buying price from the previous day. Steel Corporation was bought at 49,000 and sold at 52,000, a rise of 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>China Paper Board was sold for 70,000, a rise of 21,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Asia Navigation was bought at 29,000 and sold at 30,000. Wheelock Marden broke through the million-yuan mark, trading at 1.1 million for buying and 1.3 million for selling, an increase of 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Market Firm</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The US dollar off-market trend hardened yesterday. Due to the sharp price increase in Hong Kong, various gangs searched fiercely, already diverging from the Big Head dollars. The morning opened at 250,000 and 260,000, reaching as high as 260,000 and 270,000, closing at 245,000 and 255,000 at noon. In the afternoon, due to overnight trading, interest rates increased by 200 to 250 yuan, opening at 290,000 and 300,000, a surge of more than 50,000 compared to the previous day. In barter transactions, 9.5 yuan in US dollars exchanged for 10 yuan in Big Head dollars.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage gradually became more active. Four or five Tianjin gangs were doing it, mostly for tea payments, arbitraging out approximately 150,000 yuan, with an exchange rate of 3 yuan per 100 yuan. Qingdao also arbitraged out silver dollar remittances, with payment in cash two days after sight, an exchange rate of 6 yuan per 100 yuan.

Jiangxi gangs arbitraged out Big Head dollars in seven transactions, also with a premium, ranging from 1 to 2 yuan, because prices are low in that area, but most are remittances from local product merchants, with very small amounts. Rice gangs did not have funds for arbitrage. Several trades were arbitraged out in Changsha by Hunan gangs, with very large amounts, said to be funds for special local products, with the × Department purchasing materials totaling a huge sum of 380,000 yuan. Apart from some cash already shipped to Shanghai, most of it was paid in gold yuan at the day's price. After inquiries from reporters in various places, the method of arbitrage and the exchange rate were kept strictly confidential.</p>
<p>Street trading fluctuated narrowly. In the morning, because the Central Bank's gold and silver exchange rate remained unchanged, still one tael of gold for 52 Big Head dollars, the outflow of funds in recent days was quite large, and sentiment was stable.

<h3>Price Limits Further Relaxed Yesterday, Rice Market Trading Gradually Returning to Normal</h3>
<p>The price limit for rice was further relaxed to 1.3 million yesterday, and market trading has returned to normal. Due to tight credit, all goods are flat, sentiment is stable, and all goods can be traded within the price limit. Rice shops are weak because of tight credit and poor appetite.</p>
<p>Since the early and late japonica rice markets both opened at the price limit, the price of secondary goods was slightly reduced, with 1.28 million and 1.25 million for early rice. The total arrival of rice in the two rice markets was 2,443 stones.</p>
<p>The edible oil market was stable. Due to tight credit, many households were selling, and scattered households were unable to withstand high interest rates, so prices had little fluctuation. Soybean oil opened at 7.9 million, reaching a maximum of 8.1 million, and closed at 8 million, slightly rising by 200,000 to 300,000. Raw vegetable oil closed at 7 million, and Jiton raw oil closed at 7.7 million, an increase of 700,000 compared to the previous closing price. Small cart sesame oil opened at 760,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were scarce and prices were firm, rising by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The rising trend of flour, which had previously subsided slightly, was reignited yesterday. The reason was that news of interest rate purchases spread, and scattered households strongly absorbed it, and holders took the opportunity to raise prices. Although credit was tight, sentiment remained high, and the market stood out by rising more than 20% amidst the stabilization of the prices of hundreds of goods.</p>
<p>Old car brand opened at 495,000 yuan in the morning, gradually rising in the mid-market, and the closing price created a new high of 560,000. The Army Ship brand temporarily rose to 530,000 near the close. After the close, holders took the opportunity to sell at a high price, and returned to the 500,000 mark. Bran was raised by 10%, and Dafeng brand was priced at 428,000 yuan for large packages.</p>
<p>The prices in the miscellaneous grains market varied. Soybeans were still performing well, and market prices were firm. Soybean paste was priced at 1.25 million, and Car beans were quoted at 1.2 million yuan. Corn was firm at first and then weak. Raw peanuts were extremely sluggish in sales, falling back by 200,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Linhuai Pass retreated to the 3 million mark. Sesame trading remained scarce, and red sorghum showed a slight downward trend.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Fluctuating Unsteadily, Narrow Price Movements in the Market</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn continued to trend higher. Because market financing was expensive, holders had to add financing costs when selling. The market fluctuated little yesterday. Most prices outside the exchange were stable, and sentiment was also stabilizing. As a result, the increase in the price of each yarn was only enough for one day's interest.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix went all the way from 78 million to a high of 83 million, closing at the 8 million mark, an increase of 13 million compared to the previous day. 32-count Silver Moon rose by 9 million, ending at 53 million.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods immediately soared through the mark upon opening, creating a new high of 41 million, once surging to 44.5 million, and finally falling back to 43 million, an increase of 9 million. 20-count Double Horse approached 40 million, an increase of 20% to 25%.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market moved narrowly. In the morning, prices opened low due to the still tight money market. Afterwards, buying on dips was still enthusiastic, and the market then returned to a firm state. As a result, the market showed only slight differences compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Dragon Head Fine Cloth retreated from 1.42 million to 1.39 million. Near noon, customers frequently bought, creating a new high of 1.51 million. Near the close, there were gains and profit-taking sales, and the market showed a slight decline, finally closing at 1.45 million, a fall of 20,000.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Twill opened at 1.32 million, briefly falling to 1.28 million, reaching a high of 1.41 million mid-session, and finally closing at 1.38 million, a drop of 40,000.</p>
<p>The remaining cloths generally fell. Only Jumping Carp Yuan Guang Twill rose by 70,000. In the afternoon, the dragon head was at 1.65 million, and the Four Gentlemen Twill was at 1.6 million. There was some progress in the middle session, but in the end they fell back again, closing at 1.62 million and 1.59 million respectively in the evening.</p>
<h3>Sugar Buying Interest Undiminished</h3>
<p>The sugar market saw tight money among operators yesterday, with after-hours interest rates as high as 200 to 250 yuan. However, since buying interest had not waned, prices still rose significantly. No. 24 raw sugar was at 1.68 million in the morning, with a high of 1.86 million, a low of 1.76 million, and closed at 1.84 million at noon, rising by 30-20,000 yuan compared to yesterday.

<h3>National Banks Temporarily Suspending the Gold-for-Silver Dollar Exchange Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank's method of exchanging gold for Yuan Big Head silver dollars was temporarily suspended yesterday, so the announcement of the ratio of gold to Yuan Big Head silver dollars was stopped yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the authorities, the method of exchanging gold for silver dollars was originally a temporary expedient measure to facilitate the payment of salaries to various industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, the exchange must be done through the mediation of members of silver houses and gold guilds, proving that it is for the purpose of paying salaries. Now that the period for paying salaries in the middle of the month has passed, the method of exchanging has also been temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Feather King Ferryman Meets a Formidable Opponent; Huang Defu Delivers a Stunning Performance; Close Scores and Intense Competition as Seen Only in the Danish Open; The Malaysian-Chinese Doubles Remain Unmatched in the World</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Copenhagen, 18th] The Danish International Badminton Championships concluded today after five days of intense competition. Ferryman of the United States won the singles title. Malaysian-Chinese champion Huang Defu lost to Ferryman in a three-game bloodbath, with scores of 15-11, 14-17, and 17-15. This was the most intense battle Ferryman had ever experienced. According to Danish experts, this match was likely the most exciting of all European competitions. Ferryman told reporters after the match that the Malaysian-Chinese player might defeat him after a few more matches. Ferryman's weaknesses have been discovered by the Malaysian-Chinese players, who are beginning to attack them. His forehand smash is the weakest, and his arm and leg length give him an advantage over the shorter Malaysian-Chinese players. Ferryman had defeated Huang Defu twice before, once in the Thomas Cup and once in the British Championships. In today's first game, Ferryman took an early lead of 3-0, then 4-3. Huang caught up at 6-5, but Ferryman scored six consecutive points to lead 11-6. Huang fought back to 12-11, but Ferryman scored three more points to win the first game 15-11. The second game was a hard-fought battle. Huang took an early lead of 2-1, but Ferryman came on strong, quickly reaching 12-3. Huang scored eight consecutive points to catch up at 12-11 and then tied at 13-13. Huang won the second game 17-14. In the third game, Ferryman took a strong lead of 6-0, but Huang rallied and scored five consecutive points. Ferryman then led 14-11, but Huang tied again at 14-14. Ferryman finally won the final game 17-15.</p>
<p>In the doubles final, an all-Malaysian-Chinese affair, Huang Defu and Zhang Chengkun defeated Zeng Guanliang and Yang Decai 15-7, 18-16.</p>
<p>In the women's singles final, Tonny Ahm of Denmark defeated Sonja Rasmussen, also of Denmark, 11-4, 11-3.</p>
<p>In the women's doubles final, the Danish women took the title, with Tonny Ahm and Sonja Rasmussen defeating Skovgaard and Nielsen 15-8, 15-1.</p>
<p>In the mixed doubles final, Zeng Guanliang of Malaysia-China and Tonny Ahm defeated Martensen and Sonja Rasmussen 9-15, 15-12, 15-2.</p>
<h3>Da Gong Challenges McKinley; Exciting Basketball Tonight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sports Reporters Association, recognizing that the Da Gong basketball team had not made a public appearance since its victorious expedition to Southeast Asia (including ports in the Philippines) last year, secured sponsorship from the Municipal Committee to invite the team to perform against the U.S. Navy's Third McKinley team. The game will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium at 7:00 PM tonight. Before the main event, starting at 5:15 PM, there will be two additional matches: first, the Women's Ya Team against the Li Team, followed by John's Team against Da Tong. Tickets will be sold for 10,000 upstairs, 20,000 downstairs, and 40,000 for reserved seats inside the court. To prevent overcrowding, tickets will be pre-sold starting at 1:00 PM this afternoon, and the doors will open at 4:00 PM. Long-term passes will be valid as usual, but player IDs will not be accepted. The Siwei Boy Scouts will be present to maintain order. The schedule for the three events is listed below:</p>
<p>Ya Team – Li Team (Women) 5:15 PM</p>
<p>John – Da Tong (Men) 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Da Gong – McKinley (Men) 7:00 PM</p>
<p>The Ya Team is making its debut performance since its formation. All the female players are seasoned veterans, including Zhu Jiazhen, Huang Ruyu, Sun Fengzhu, Qian Mengyue, and Wang Zhelun, known for their experience and fame throughout the league. Wang Shan, Zhu Min, Wu Zhaorui, and Zhu Lanzhen are representatives of the city's National Games team and are particularly skilled. Therefore, the entire team has excellent offense and defense and a strong lineup. The Li Team has participated in the league's women's division for three years. Although they are ranked at the bottom, they have been persistent. In the recent Mayor's Cup, they only lost by ten points to the Li Team, showing significant improvement. They are expected to put up a good fight against Ya.</p>
<p>Following the women's game, there will be a match between the two major university teams, John and Da Tong. Since the conclusion of the university and college basketball tournament, school team matches have been rare. John has been a dominant force in university basketball for years, boasting five top players from Group A: Sun Guozheng, Tao Yingshi, Huang Tianlie, Sun Moses, and Hu Huizhao, known for their bravery, skillful defense, and superior technique. Da Tong has the three musketeers, Xu Zhongsi, Le Jiazhou, and Li Hanting, renowned players from the Hua Lian and Ren Yu teams in Group A1, known for their excellent skills and refined technique. Other players, such as Dong Qiwen, are also accomplished players, making the outcome uncertain.</p>
<p>The main event will be Da Gong against McKinley. Da Gong toured Malaya, Singapore, Manila, Hong Kong, and other places last year, playing forty games, winning thirty-four, drawing three, and losing three, achieving remarkable results and making a name for themselves. Team captain Cai Wenhua, vice-captain Tu Wenlong, and National Games athlete Cai Zhongqi each possess unique skills. Huang Bailing, Zhan Chen, Wang Cunzhong, and Ye Yunshan are also agile players. Since returning last month, they have been training hard and are full of energy. Today is their first official appearance, and they are expected to deliver an exciting and intense performance.</p>
<p>McKinley was transferred to Shanghai from Qingdao and has participated in numerous league and friendly matches, achieving considerable success. In the Mayor's Cup, they originally faced the Police Machine Team, but the latter withdrew. They then played a friendly match against the Green Forest Team, which was a closely contested battle. The game went into overtime twice without a winner, demonstrating the team's strength. It is expected that they will bring out their best players for tonight's game and fight tooth and nail, promising a thrilling and intense match.</p>

Hu Zuochang, Hu Yiping, and Feng Hao in particular, with their fierce smashes, were unstoppable. In the Silk White team, Zhu Jiang and Yang Changxi fought hard against Chen Xingquan. The two fought fiercely for three games, but Xingquan's defense proved too much for Changxi, who lost 1-2.

As a result, Lianxing defeated Silk White 4-1. The remaining matches were Group B matches, which took place in various halls. The results of all seven matches were as expected, except for Youlian, a team of rising stars, which suffered a crushing 2-3 defeat at the hands of Xin Yun Fansheng, a major upset.

<h3>Table Tennis Must-Knows</h3>
<p>— Gong Xinmao, Edited by Chen Linsheng</p>
<p>(9) Basic Table Tennis Practice</p>
<p>The above explained that playing table tennis should start with practicing "close blocking." When practicing, attention should be paid to controlling the height and direction. Controlling the height and direction is the most basic practice for playing table tennis. After practicing these two techniques, it is easy to practice other techniques. If these two techniques are not mastered, imitating the posture and methods of famous players will only lead to superficiality and wasted effort.</p>
<p>Controlling the height, except for people who are learning table tennis, because they are not familiar with various movements, the balls they hit often cannot be controlled as desired. This is a stage that must be gone through. Diligent practice will lead to faster progress, and a considerable understanding of the theoretical methods will lead to even faster progress. Some people, although they have achieved considerable success in playing table tennis, can only understand the balls they hit intuitively and cannot know the reason why. This is because they have not deeply studied the theory. The method of controlling the height of the table tennis ball when hitting it is a basic skill. The reasons why the table tennis ball is hit high or low are roughly no more than the following points:</p>
<p>The Relationship between the Player and the Distance to the Ball When the ball is coming and going, if you are far away from the table and the ball is very close to the net, and the momentum of the ball is very weak, it is too late to reach forward to receive it. You have to stretch your arm as far as possible to make up for it, and the racket becomes flatter, and the ball hit will be higher. If you are very close to the table, the ball you hit is in the middle of the swing, and the height of the ball will be very appropriate. Even if you want the ball to be very high or very low, it will be very easy, unlike being far away from the table where you have the will but not the strength. Why does the flatter the racket, the higher the ball hit? This is entirely due to the angle formed between the table tennis racket and the ball. The smaller the angle, the lower the ball hit, and the larger the angle, the higher the ball hit.</p>
<h3>Democratic Cup Football Main Match; Kyushu Faces Huaguang Today</h3>

<p>He An Boleda Tao Huosi Huisi Yalian Pengsi</p>
<p>Three American female basketball national team players, all over five feet ten inches tall</p>
<h3>Three Outstanding American Female Basketball Players</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] Yalian Pengsi, Tao Lisi Huisi, and He An Boleda are the three forwards of the U.S. Women's Amateur Basketball Team. They are also the mainstays of the American women's basketball champion Blue Team. Since 1942, the Blue Team has been a leader in the basketball world. Last season, they were invincible in forty games, large and small.</p>
<p>These three female players, who make up the Blue Team's invincible frontline, are all taller than our country's male players.</p>
<p>Yalian Pengsi (see the photo on the left, with six stars on her shorts) is the captain of the Blue Team and the All-American Team. This 26-year-old redhead is five feet eleven inches tall and weighs 150 pounds. Since graduating from middle school in 1938, she has participated in more than ten teams and has always been elected as the captain. Since being selected as an All-American representative in 1940, she has always been on the list, and this year is her ninth selection. Ms. Pengsi's basketball skills are amazing, and she has the superb skill of hitting the basket with both her left and right hands. Last season, in the final against a certain team, Pengsi injured her right arm the day before, but she still勉力出場. As a result, she scored 33 points with her left hand alone, defeating a strong opponent. Pengsi is also humble and treats her teammates like sisters and cares for the injured and young like a慈母. In non-important battles, she often steps aside to give younger players a chance to play. However, last season she still scored 596 points alone.</p>
<p>Taolisi Huisi, 25 years old, five feet ten inches tall. She is a versatile player who can attack and defend. Her style is fierce, and when she plays defense, she often makes the enemy forwards shrink back. The golden-haired Wins is also often proud of this. Off the court, Wins treats people kindly and is a secretary at an Atlantic City oil company.</p>
<p>"Leopard Girl" An Boleda, has the same height as Huisi and weighs 54 pounds. "Leopard Girl" is a 23-year-old, pampered daughter of a wealthy family. In addition to playing basketball, she spends all day driving around on the highway; at night, she likes to show off another set of floor skills - London dance and sailor dance. "Leopard Girl" also loves to play baseball and is a first baseman for the Lexington men's baseball team (Xiaoxing).</p>

<p>"Assume" is not a scary word in itself. Because it not only contains a big question mark, but also has great flexibility - it can be so, but not necessarily so; it also leaves people with a glimmer of hope that "it is not so."</p>
<p>However, now, assuming is a terrible word. Its threatening power is no less than adjusting prices instead of raising them, and the long string of circles behind the numbers. Because now's "assumption," at the time of assuming, does still leave people with a bit of hope that maybe it won't be so; but in fact, when the fact of the price increase is announced, the so-called "assumption" is often after the fact. The beautiful anticipation is all shattered.</p>
<p>For example: the cost of living index for the first half of March was more than 1,300 times; the assumed index for public utilities in late March was more than 2,200 times; the "assumed" price increase was slightly less than 70 percent. However, the cost of living index for the second half of March was more than 3,600 times, an actual increase of slightly less than 180 percent. The expression of this fact is equivalent to telling the citizens publicly that this "assumption" is still the lowest estimate. If you are not an idiot, you should look "up." Therefore, as soon as the "assumption" is "certain," everything first lines up to increase prices!</p>
<p>For another example, the assumed index for public utilities announced on April 8 was more than 6,900 times, an increase of more than 90 percent compared to the index of more than 3,600 times. If we still follow the example of last month, then our cost of living index for the first half of April should be at least more than 11,000 times. But this is not "assumed."</p>
<p>Because the "Committee on Suggestions for Solving the Cash Shortage" used 10,000 times as the "assumption" for the cost of living index for the first period of this month when meeting on the 11th to raise cash to pay workers' salaries. From this point of view, it was known early on that "unfortunately, it will be hit."</p>
<p>Of course, the index is determined based on the rise and fall of prices, and its sharp rise is not its own crime. The "assumed index" is the same, it is just an "assumption" in the transition between the old and new indexes, and it does not have its own crime.</p>
<p>However, I always feel that the publication of the cost of living index twice a month is already enough to make people panic. Now, two more "assumed indexes" have been added out of thin air, which really gives people the feeling of a leaky house being hit by continuous rain. Because as soon as the "assumption" is "certain," although it is not really "certain," everything will increase in price, which is always the case.</p>
<p>The common people are already so overwhelmed by life that they can't breathe. Can the authorities have a little kindness, cancel this "assumption," and reduce a little suffering for the citizens?</p>
<h3>Some Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Awakener</p>
<p>Successful revolutionaries are called "heroes," but unsuccessful ones are often called "traitors." Everyone says that money is the root of all evil, but no one is willing to give their money away to others for nothing.</p>
<p>"Science benefits mankind," many people echo. But they don't realize that weapons of mass destruction like bombs and cannons are also products of science.</p>
<p>Some say: "Life is like a dream." Then isn't hope a "dream within a dream"?</p>
<p>What makes people worried is "desire," and what makes people excited is also "desire."</p>
<p>Passing a birthday means getting closer to the grave; from this point of view, birthdays are not only not worth celebrating, but are actually very worth grieving.</p>
<p>The purpose of life seems to be just to tear off dozens of calendars.</p>
<h3>Discussing Improving the Index</h3>
<p>— Li Jie</p>
<p>Since Li, the adoption of the cost of living index to calculate wages has indeed reduced a lot of trouble for Shanghai society, especially in labor-management disputes. The index is something that has made undeniable contributions over the years. However, in the past one or two months, due to the sharp devaluation of the Gold Yuan, prices have risen by 50 percent or even doubled every day, causing the salaries calculated based on the cost of living index to be greatly out of touch with actual needs, leaving workers in a state of helplessness and living from hand to mouth. At this point, the index issue seems to need to be reconsidered and improved.</p>
<p>The numbers of the cost of living index themselves are absolutely scientific. Moreover, in terms of its calculation method, it is also very accurate. Some people see that the cost of living index is out of touch with real prices and suspect that there must be bargaining in the semi-monthly index review meeting to discount the real index by 30 percent or 20 percent. I don't believe this. Because if the authorities want to play tricks, they can do it during the investigation, why be so foolish as to discount it after the index is calculated, so as to give people something to grab? The cost of living index itself is not flawed; so where is the flaw? In the number of investigations.</p>
<p>The index was originally a general record of prices in the past half month. But today, because workers and salary earners who are paid according to the index use the index published in the first half of the month to convert salaries and live through the future days of the second half of the month. So this "historical record" seems to have become a "prior standard." The cost of living index is investigated several times every half month. When prices are relatively stable, the first and last investigations are not much different, so the average number is naturally similar; but when prices rise sharply, the situation is very different. For example, in half a month, the first investigation shows that the price of rice is one million yuan per stone, the second investigation is 1.4 million yuan, the third investigation is 1.8 million yuan, and the fourth investigation is 2.4 million yuan. The average of the four times, that is, the average price of rice in the first half of the month, is 1.65 million yuan. This fourth investigation was on the 29th, the day before the cost of living index was published. By the time the index is published and the money is received, it is already the 1st at the earliest. After two days, the price of rice has risen to 2.8 million yuan. Where can you buy a stone of rice with this average number? You can only buy five or six斗!</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that when prices fluctuate sharply, the method of using averages is absolutely not feasible. Because the wages or salaries received by workers and staff are intended to cover the cost of living after the index is published, and they cannot go back a few days to buy rice at a price of 1.6 million yuan per stone. Therefore, the index should naturally be based on prices closer to the date of publication, and it should also be more reasonable.</p>
<p>Today, I saw in the newspaper that the General Labor Union has asked the authorities to change the method. I don't know if the General Labor Union has already proposed a method. I think that to solve the urgent problem, it is only necessary to cancel the first few investigations in each half month and change to investigating only once per period, that is, on the 14th and 29th of each month (the big month is thirty days), and announce it immediately the next day. In this way, the index and prices will not be too far out of touch. (Editor's note: It has now been decided to change to a weekly salary system.)</p>
<h3>Contributing Financial Reform Ideas</h3>
<p>— Keyun</p>
<p>Recently, several gentlemen of the financial authorities, although very adept at business tactics, buying high and selling low, using gold to make money, I fear it will still be of no avail to the empty national treasury. I, as a member of the people, after much thought, have come up with a few solutions, which I hereby offer to the financial authorities. If adopted, I guarantee they will make money, enrich the country, and replenish the treasury with ease. I respectfully present them as follows:</p>
<p>Firstly, one might follow the previous method of adding value to postage stamps by imprinting the recovered legal tender and small-denomination gold yuan notes with the words "Temporarily used as × ten thousand gold yuan." This would, of course, save a significant amount of printing costs and a large quantity of fine paper. As for the worn-out condition of the banknotes, that would not matter. Just issue a clear announcement: that none of the issued banknotes will be recalled. Since the banknotes are already worn out and have passed through the hands of many people, once they become unusable, they can only be burned or thrown into the trash, naturally preventing further currency inflation. When the supply of discarded banknotes is exhausted, domestically produced Lian Shi paper or Mao Bian paper, etc., can be used for printing, with the same effect. This would be even more beneficial for promoting the increased production of domestic paper.</p>
<p>Secondly, the current method of selling gold is not thorough enough. It seems one could select a day and sell all the gold bars at half the market price, completely selling them out. If the people do not have enough cash, they can convert real estate or silver dollars into gold yuan notes, which will be accepted in the same way. The public will naturally flock to it. However, one thing must be noted: the addresses of the purchasers must be recorded. A few hours after the sale, suddenly issue an emergency order announcing that gold is nationalized. Anyway, the addresses of the purchasers are readily available. Immediately mobilize a large number of people to track them down and confiscate the original items. In this way, gold yuan notes that have been released can be recovered out of thin air, and real estate and silver dollars, etc., can be earned. After a few days, announce that the people can hold gold again. Repeat this method again and again, and of course, great profits will be made.</p>
<p>Thirdly, announce that the salaries of government employees, educators, and soldiers will be calculated in full according to the local cost of living index, and their base salaries will be increased. However, only a small portion is paid in cash, and the majority is paid in "national treasury stock." After a few rounds, when the stock is exhausted, a capital increase can be implemented, requiring each share to be subscribed for with several shares. If people are willing to subscribe, more currency can be recovered; if they cannot subscribe, the stock will be declared invalid, and the "board of directors" will be responsible for raising the shortfall, which can then be issued later. In this way, there will be no worry about being unable to pay salaries.</p>
<p>The above three points, whether one or all are adopted, can greatly help the finances. However, it would be best to ask medical or chemical professionals to invent a kind of anesthetic drug to be dispersed in the air, so that the people of the whole country are numb, making it naturally easier to implement these measures.</p>
<h3>The Magic Weapon is Broken Again</h3>
<p>— Xiumu</p>
<h3>Government Employees and Educators</h3>
<p>— Xianweisheng</p>
<p>I, the writer, resent my parents for making me study, which has condemned me to a life within the "government employees and educators" realm. I have been working in administrative agencies for a full ten years; in educational institutions, even longer. No matter how I try, I have never been able to escape this "golden cage."</p>
<p>Because of this, my life is over. Therefore, whenever I hear the words "government employees and educators," I simply get a headache.</p>
<p>Some people say: "Government" is "government employees," and "education" is "teachers." They cannot be lumped together, not to mention the distinction between "provincial" and "county" levels. For example, every time salaries are adjusted, those at the provincial level are so direct and swift, the money is in their hands; while those at the county level can take a good nap and wait.</p>
<p>Some people also say: Not only that, but there are even more mysteries in this. Even after salaries are issued according to the salary standards, there are different experiences. For example, if you and the accounting clerk are from the same hometown, or you were brought in by a superior, then it is easier to borrow salary during lean times; otherwise, there is no need to even ask.</p>
<p>In short, the most unfortunate ones are, of course, those in "education," especially those in "county-level education," who have the least chance of survival. For example, recently, municipal teachers in Shanghai received 2700 times their salary, but in our noble county - Taicang, since the beginning of the school year, not even one times salary has been issued. To make matters worse, the authorities, with their quick minds, launched a "raising temporary education funds" campaign at the beginning of the school year, with elementary school teachers receiving three to five dou of rice, barely enough to survive until now. But it's like a drop in the bucket, even if all the funds are used, each person still receives less than the "bowing salary," - so how can I not resent my parents!</p>

<h3>Two Post-War Japanese Matters</h3>
<p>— Yanling</p>
<p>Madame Butterfly</p>
<p>The famous Japanese actress Michi Sunahara has been invited by the Teatro Colón in Argentina, South America, this spring to perform in the opera "Madame Butterfly." This is the first time a Japanese actress has appeared on an international stage since the war. When Sunahara received the invitation, she told reporters, "I would be lonely going alone. If I don't have a companion, I am..." When she set off, she finally took a singer named Suzuki with her.</p>
<p>Commemorative Holidays</p>
<p>Before the war, Japan had more than twenty commemorative holidays, but after the war, due to being forced to "embark on the path of democracy," some feudal commemorative holidays were gradually eliminated. Currently, there are only nine left. Namely: New Year's Day, Coming-of-Age Day, Children's Day, Emperor's Birthday, Constitution Memorial Day, Culture Day, Labor Thanksgiving Day, Vernal Equinox, and Autumnal Equinox. Holidays like Meiji Day and the Spring and Autumn Festivals at Yasukuni Shrine no longer exist.</p>
