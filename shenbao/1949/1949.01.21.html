<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕英外交部十九日正式否認英政府準備承認中共政府之說。據消息靈通方面稱：今日測英國對中共獲最後勝利時將作何決議，尙屬過早，英政府目前之遠東政策爲「靜觀時變」，此際大局混沌，無從捉摸，甚至豫測，亦非其時。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕行政院新聞局長沈昌煥，廿日對記者正式否認所有關於蔣總統行動之傳說。沈氏出席記者招待會時，係甫自總統官邸歸來，但旋卽爲各方詢問總統行動之電話所困擾，因就此項問題在招待會上發表聲明，某記者曾詢以蔣總統何日赴粵，沈氏稱：本人向未聞及關於此事之消息，沈氏並否認外間所傳總統出遊及中政會討論總統進退問題之謠言。蓋此項謠言廿日下午二時起卽散布首都，少數報紙且曾據以發布號外，而使市民略感惶惑，惟此項謠言旋卽證明其不確。沈氏就若干記者詢及十九日政院聲明與廿日中政會有關時局之討論提出答覆稱：「自總統發表示旦文吿，表示和平願望以後，舉國反響至爲良好，各省市參議會等人民團體，籲請政府及中共先行停戰，然後開始和平談判，行政院爲遵從人民之願望起見，特於十九日發表聲明，表示政府願與中共雙方立卽無條件停戰，並各指定代表開始和談，此舉充分顯示政府業已進一步的蘄求和平，且再度證明政府願早日恢復和平之誠意。廿日晨中政會會議廣泛討論時局，並追認政院昨日之決議案，此外無其他決定，外傳種種，純係謠言」。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿日下午四時半電〕華北人民和平促進會十代表，前日出城赴西郊海甸（燕京大學所在地）與共方洽商特別是平，獲有相當結果。據悉：渠等到達海甸之夕，卽將七省市議長致毛澤東籲請與傅作義合作電正式面交共方代表，共方代表表示卽行轉交；翌晨繼續談判停戰問題，共方表示日來根本沒打，已等於「休戰」，至於不向城內發射「冷砲」問題，共方允轉達共軍部隊長注意。至於休戰日期，亦未肯定以十日爲限。休戰後北平和談如何繼續進行，並未具體討論，惟衆信當別有途徑可尋。此外，十代表曾就傅總司令政治民主，經濟平等，生活自由之主張，與其勤苦淸廉，不貪汚腐化作風多所闡述，引起激辯亦多，代表團中以何思源發言最多。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日下午七時半電〕昨夜今晨平郊偶聞砲聲，但已無正式接觸，和平使者昨由西郊歸來後，曾顯示局部和平正循另一途徑進行，若干奔走和平人士正埋頭爲此事努力，已距成熟期不遠，平戰氛漸减，四郊民房傳將停拆，城門檢查亦決定放寬，惟展修機塲爆除障碍物之夜半斷繼巨響，仍難令人安眠。</p>
<p>〔聯合社上海廿日訊〕聯合社駐平記者今晨通過新聞檢查，傳到北平停戰協定大綱如下：（一）北平與歸綏移交共軍；（二）傅作義辭職，由鄧寳珊繼任，傅氏不復視爲華北戰爭罪犯，其他將領去留悉聽自由；（三）傅部軍隊改稱「民主自衛軍」，不受共軍直接指揮，最後或將予以解散；（四）協定於一月二十日或廿一日實施，俾共軍得及時開入北平，籌備於陰層新年舉行慶祝。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿日電〕北平的和平或破壞，二十日因和平代表團的返城，謠諑紛起，到達了紛擾的最高峯。雖然代表團拒絕正式添露與共方商談之結果，但個人則均自由對報界發表談話，以致本日的報紙上，充滿各種甚至相互矛盾的消息，幾令人相信代表團代表係各個人分別出席不同的會議者。某代表稱：共軍同意休戰十天，以待和平談判；另一代表以後又稱：共軍指出，事實上北平現已休戰，因爲共軍現未　中攻城，並有許多機會可以談和。</p>
<p>根據各代表發表之談話，及各報所載消息，和談經過之情形當如下述：此項會議並非最高級者，共軍司令員葉劍英及高級共軍將領均未出席，據稱彼等已赴天津，雖然若干代表宣稱參與會談者爲「高級共軍官員」，但某一代表私人承認，共軍與會代表不過爲不級軍官而已。會議繼續至下午十一時，翌晨再開，至上午十一時結束，共方在第一次會議中盛宴款待，在第二次會議中態度亦大爲改善。</p>
<p>一般認爲，共軍與會人員並無決定允許休戰之櫂。某代表稱：共軍同意停止轟城，但另一代表則又稱：共方曾指出「在戰爭繼續中，城內落彈若干係無法避免者」。</p>
<p>十九日晚城內仍有落彈，二十日晨則無，但城郊傳來的機槍聲則顯出並未全面休戰。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕國防部發言人鄧文儀廿日宣稱：天津戰事告一段落後，塘沽守軍已登艦安全撤至指定地點，撤退時僅損失一個營，天津守軍兩個軍大部損失，匪林彪所部在攻津之役中，至少損失六萬五千人，現林匪已有四個縱隊由津調平，北平附近該地區之匪現有十二個縱隊。</p>

<h3 id="c17">共黨雖不顧人民和平願望　國國則採取防禦應戰方策　——國防部政工局發表一週戰况—— <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕國防部政工局頃發表十三日至十九日一週戰局稱：本週初，共黨雖提出回答總統元旦文吿的條件，但軍事方面仍不顧全國人民的和平願望，不斷向我天津猛攻，惟國軍在各戰塲均能遵照統帥部之指示，採取防禦應戰方策，不作主動攻略，一面積極調整部署，鞏固新陣地，以防共黨不顧全國人民和平之願望時，爲全國人民之願望，不惜繼續作持久戰，直至共方覺悟，或完全勝利爲止。</p>
<p>（一）華北戰塲：天津方面，林彪全部主力集中進攻天津，自本月六日起發動攻勢，於十四，十五兩日，向天津國軍陣地發動猛烈攻勢，雙方在西營門一帶激戰甚烈，國軍以兵力單薄，被迫一改守內綫防禦，與匪繼續作戰，當面林彪主力所部第一·二·三·七·八·九·十二等縱隊，約四倍於天津守軍，共匪死傷甚爲慘重，戰事持續至十五日晚間，方吿結束，統計天津防禦戰歷時廿九日，雙方主力作戰亦歷十日，匪軍死傷仕六萬五千人以上，國軍以天津爲華北工商業精華所在，不忍過度毀壞，一面盡力與匪作戰，一面仍盡力保護市民的生命財產，故在戰略上頗受影響，國軍在天津的忍辱負重，以致蒙受損失。由於天津戰局的變化，塘大地區國軍爲了適應新戰略，已安全撤退乘海軍船艦向指定地區轉進。北平四週，連日僅有小接觸，各方人士雖在竭力呼籲保存這文化故都，但是共黨能否約束其部隊，以順應人民的要求，却還大有問題，因爲近日共軍似仍在積極準備攻城，林彪在天津附近之隊伍，已有四個縱隊向平郊集中。</p>
<p>（二）華東戰塲：自蕭永地區戰鬥結束後，國軍當卽重新展開新部署，以防共軍一面談和一面進攻之陰謀，於略得整補後，繼續南犯。現國軍已自淮河北岸地區各據點，主動撤至淮河以南，長江以北之新防棧，改取防禦姿態，佈置重兵，隨時機動，以爲長江防棧的前衛基地。截至十八日止，蚌埠臨淮關一帶仍在國軍手中，共軍有小部隊進行偸渡，會發生局部戰鬥。淮河北岸，共軍以數月來主力傷損失大，補給困難，最短期內似無大規模蠢動模樣。至於淮河南岸，則國軍正從事肅淸散匪，部署防綫，以現勢論，江北地區防務甚爲鞏固。政府與全國人民，目前所渴望和平實現，但是作戰凖備仍未稍懈，採取備戰謀和，而不求和忘戰之原則。本月初，共黨曾發佈緊急「征兵令」，限本年二月十五日以前，華北各地須將十六歲以上四十八歲以下之壯丁，儘量征集一百萬，迫令送至河北鄲邯集中訓練，以備作今後人海戰術之犧牲工具，其他各地，共黨亦仍在積極使用恐怖政策，謠言攻勢，作爲其野戰部隊的前哨，故和平並非單方面所能獲得，共黨如不顧國家民族前途，不顧全國人民願望，繼續作其軍事投機，政府爲爭取國家民族之獨立自由，與保障人民之自由生活方式，當不惜長期作戰。</p>

<h3 id="c18">展望美蘇關係的好轉 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>杜魯門總統已於昨日就任第三十三屆總統之職，並發表就職演說，謂今後將盡力推行民主黨之政綱，爲人類覓致世界和平；同時又强調全人類之親睦應與人生行爲之其他神聖厚則並進。演辭簡短，歷十五分鍊始畢，曾用無綫電轉播全世界。在世界局勢動盪不定的今日，世界各國的人民聽到了杜魯門總統致力和平的呼聲，莫不視爲國際陰霾中透射出的一綫陽光，而寄以無限的希望。</p>
<p>回顧第二次大戰結束以來的國際政治，不難證明今日國際問題的寗結，厥在美蘇兩國的積不相容，這世界的兩强假如能有一天釋嫌修好，恢復戰時兩國駢肩作戰爭取勝利的精神，則目前的一切國際問題就不難迎刃而解。世人基於這個正確的看法，故一致認爲：如欲世界能獲致眞正的和平，必先謀得美蘇間的協調，杜魯門總統旣以締造世界和平爲己任，其首須努力的，應該是力求美蘇間的諒解。而蘇聯在杜魯門總統就職之前夕，早就由蘇聯駐美大使館所發行的「新聞報道」發表一文，主張「雙方諒解以促進美蘇間的友誼」。此文雖可目爲蘇聯的「和平攻勢」，但未嘗不可爲美蘇關係轉變的契機，値得世人的重視。代理國務卿羅凡特也於十九日發表談話，表示美國歡迎蘇聯以具有建設性的合作熊度來證明其對於和平的誠意，並希望蘇聯對於柏林封鎖問題及對奧和約問題，能抱比較合作之態度。</p>
<p>從羅凡特的談話看來，在美蘇之間尙有相當遙遠的距離，欲求兩國關係的改善，固非一蹴可成；但杜魯門總統在競選時，會向選民提供諾言，謂在今後四年之內，將致力於對蘇聯各領袖獲致諒解，以確保世界和平；現在就任伊始，就應該在這一方面努力，庶可履行其諾言，不負選民的期望；否則在野黨必將以此爲攻擊杜魯門政府的藉口，何况美國進步黨執行委員會早已發表宣言，要求杜魯門總統實踐其「我們都需要和平」的聲明，與史丹林直接會晤，談判美蘇間的基本衝突。所以看大勢，今後美國政府必將盡力設法打開美蘇間的僵局。最近馬歇爾國務卿的辭職，遺缺由艾契遜繼任，實可目爲美國外交指向信一個方向的前奏。</p>
<p>在目前美國的朝野，雖然仍充滿了反共防蘇的論調，足以阻滯改善美蘇關係運動的發展；但是檢討美國兩年來的對蘇外交，却不能不承認美國外交的運用，確實未能盡如人意。平心而論，所謂杜魯鬥主義，以至所謂馬歇爾計劃，站在美國反共防蘇的立塲上看，固不大爲一種强硬的辦法；但若以整憫的世界和平而論，其後果如何？是値得深切研究的；何况國務院在執行的時候，往往徘徊瞻顧，而不能雷厲風行，貫澈其目的；甚至有時不能普遍推行，忘了世界的整個性，對於歐亞竟有先後之分，在歐洲雖獲有若干成就，但因在亞洲的落後，也减少其意義。所以今日美國，除非不顧一切蠻幹到底，否則就得考慮如何改善對蘇關係了。</p>
<p>要之，美蘇合作是世界和平的先決條件，不論是世界各國的人民，就是美蘇兩國自已的人民，只要是愛好和平厭棄戰爭的，也無不盼望美蘇兩國釋嫌修好，均能拿出誠意與好感來促進兩國的友誼。不過改善美蘇關係的機會，和其他的機會一樣，也是稍縱即逝的；現在國際間旣已有此新的醞釀，有利於兩國關係好轉的發展，我們自當希望美蘇雙方都能特別珍重此一良機，大家正視現實，抓住機會，立即改善美蘇關係，扭轉國際間的逆流，使普天之下均能化戾氣爲祥和。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十日合衆電〕杜魯門總統今日競職，築宣稱，吾人對民主之信心，可戰勝共產主義，以及共產主義之一切罪惡，且可爭取他日之和平。杜魯門今日在此間莊嚴之儀式中，宣誓就職，爲美國第卅三屆總統，此後渠卽發表就職演說，　請全國人民抱定信心，以不流血之鬥爭爭取勝利。渠幷謂，此項鬥爭應由吾人發動。總統今日發表四項外交政策之原則，而謂此四原則，將使各自由國家强大興盛，而使共黨國家放梁其幻想，與吾人和平共處。今午巴克萊在李特法官監視下，宣誓就任副總統，而杜魯門在最高法院院長文生監視之下，宣誓就任大總統之職。千百萬人民今日　集五光十色之此間廣塲上，參觀此一歷史性之一幕，及街頭之遊行。當杜魯門以其左手置於兩本聖經上，宣誓「余決支持及保障憲法」之時，羣衆報以熱烈歡呼。總統就職演說幾未提及內政問題，而强調爭取冷戰之勝利，不使其演變爲眞正之戰爭。杜魯門總統今日未直接提及蘇聯，但渠對共產主義作冗長犀利及詳盡之抨斥。渠逐條比較共產主義與民主主義，而將共產主義之　僞哲學之劣點，與美國民主生活方式之優點，作鮮明之比較。渠幷强調謂，美國希望和平高於一切，但渠立稱，和平不能以「取悅共黨」以獲致，而祗能自增强自由國家在經濟軍事及社會方面之力量以獲致。渠幷稱，全球其他各國人民，包括共黨領導下各國之人民，俱以緊張不安之態度，靜候未來之演變，而以過去從未有之焦灼態度，等待美國之友情協助，以及賢明之領導。獎繼又聲明「和平及自由」計劃之四項原則，而謂此後四年之美國外交政策卽將以此四原則爲依歸。此四原則爲：（一）繼續支持聯合國：（二）盡吾人之全力支持歐洲復興計劃，（三）藉集體防禦公約，及軍事援助西歐，使自由國家加强力量，而使侵略者不敢覬覦命，　以强大力量協助落後國家，使其成爲與盛之民主國家。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十日電〕社魯門總統的誓辭如下；「我鄭重地宣誓：我願忠實執行美國總統的職務，並願盡我的能力支持保陣美國的憲法。」杜魯門宣誓時用聖經兩部，調和宗敎情操及鄉土愛護心，，渠之左手不時觸及兩書，小本聖純置於翻開的大太聖經之上。此一小本聖經，卽渠在一九四五年四月十二日羅斯福逝世後宣誓就職總統時所用。大本聖經則爲已具有四百九十三年歷史的古頓堡聖經原版。</p>
<h3 id="c48">杜魯門演辭要點　增強民主力量為政策目標　願於和平協調中共同生活 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十日合衆電〕杜魯門總統就職演說要點如下：今日不僅爲一新政府執政之開始，且爲一段終或將決定吾人及世界前途之時期開始。吾人今日之最高需要，乃世人面臨未來之嚴重局勢，今後發展如何，茫然不可知。在此猜疑叢生之時，世人之股股期待美國之善意。實力。及明智之領導，莫逾於今日。因此吾人宜於此一時際，宣佈吾人所信賴之主要原則，以及吾人之目標。</p>
<p>主義衝突</p>
<p>最重要者，我人希望公允而永久之和平，我人決竭盡努力，冀其實現。而此種和平，則應基於平等地位，自由討論而獲得之眞誠協議。爲追求此一目標，美國及其他志同道合之國家，察及本身直接面臨一與吾人目標相抵觸之政權，其生活觀念與吾人完全相異。此一虛假之哲學，卽爲共產主義。共產主義認爲世界分裂而成敵對之階級乃不可免者，而民主主義則認爲自由國家可以公正解決歧見，而維　永久和平。一年之前，吾人與歐洲十六自由國家發動歷史上規模最宏偉之經濟合作計劃，此種工作之目的，爲加强民主歐洲之力量，以使大陸上之自由人民可以其在文明中之正確地位，而對世界之安全與福利有所貢獻。吾人之努力，使人類重獲希望，吾人擊退失敗主義，吾人使若干國家得免於喪失自由。世界上千萬人民均與吾人具有同一之見解，卽吾人不需要戰爭，吾人可以獲得和平·吾人具有發動之力量·此後數年中吾人之和平自由計劃，將着重以下四點：</p>
<p>四項原則</p>
<p>卽（一）繼續堅決支持聯合國，覓取途徑，加强其威信，增加共力量。（二）繼續世界經濟復興計劃，是卽吾人首先必須充分支持援歐計劃，吾人深信此世界復興之重大嘗試，必可成功，而與吾人合作之國家亦可恢復其自給自足地位。（三）吾人將加强愛好和平之國家，以抵制侵略危機。吾人現與若干國家訂立協議，以求加强北大西洋之安全，此種協議之型態，卽聯合國憲章範圍內之集體防衛辦法。吾人已於里約熱內盧條約中，爲西半球成立此種防衛協定，此種協定之基本目的乃在表明自由國家共同抵制武裝攻擊之共同決心。余盼不久能向參院提出。關於北大西洋安全計劃之條約，（四）吾人必須發動勇敢之新計劃利用科學進步工業發邊，使落後之地區發展，吾人之目的應爲協助自由之人民，以本身之努力增產。</p>
<p>繁榮自由</p>
<p>往日之帝國主義剝削行為，於吾人之計劃中並無地位，世界資源之適當利用，世界國家包括美國均受其利，根據過去之經騐，其他國家於工業及經濟方面進步，則美國與此種國家之貿易亦益形增加，增加生產爲繁熒與和平之基本條件。根據上述四種途徑，吾人希望能有助於全人類之獲取目由與幸福。凡追求自由生活眞理與安全，及希望言論宗敎自由者，均可支持吾人。世界以百萬計之急求正義者，亦卽吾人之盟友，余深信世界國家明瞭民主政治之利益後，目前反對吾人之國家，卽將與自由世界携手，而解決國際間之一切紛爭。</p>

<p>據輸管會息：新年後半月間，因時局關係，出口情况並未隨新歲而有進展。兩週來上海物價勁升，內地如昆榕漢口等埠，遂亦紛紛報漲，外銷品較上年年杪增價一倍至二倍左右。同時內匯掛高，以致影響一般出口貿易。</p>
<p>外匯移轉證價上半月內節節報高，對出。頗有鼓勵，但影響進口商買氣，故央行於十日發出第一七〇號外匯通函，規定外匯移轉證購買者身份，除持有輸入許可證者，或已在申請輸入而可望核准者外，一般人民均不得購買，俾符進出口連鎖制原則，而防業外人士競購套匯。於是十四日後外匯移轉證價卽吿下落，竟跌至僑匯牌價以下。出口商方面，均認爲外匯移轉證價至少應維持僑匯水凖，不然出口便將疲英能興。</p>

<p>由於戰後世界各國漸次復興，去年物產較前年顯有增加，因而一般國家對輸出貿易咸表重視。日本尤見活躍，我當局對轍出向極注意，本年度除已開放私人對日之現金貿易，以增加中日商務外，其他各項推廣措施，亦在分別加强及研議中。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Central Political Council Held an Extraordinary Meeting Yesterday: Ratified the Executive Yuan's Resolution on Peace, Discussed Representative Candidates, Modalities, and Locations, and Determined the Relocation of the Navy, Army, and Air Force Headquarters to Taiwan and Guangzhou <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Executive Yuan's resolution on the peace issue on the 19th was presented to the Kuomintang Central Political Council at an extraordinary meeting on the morning of the 20th. Sun Ke attended and reported, and after discussion, it was resolved to ratify and approve it. The meeting was chaired by Sun Ke, who reported on the circumstances of the passage of the Executive Yuan's resolution on the 19th. Then, Wu Tiecheng, concurrently the Minister of Foreign Affairs, reported on the attitudes and contents of the replies from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France regarding mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Next, Xu Yongchang, the Minister of National Defense, reported on the enemy and our troop strengths in various war zones, as well as the defense forces and deployments in Nanjing and Shanghai. Immediately afterward, the discussion of the Executive Yuan's resolution commenced, with many committee members making speeches. Gu Zhenggang, Pan Gongzhan, Shao Hua, and Li Zonghuang, among others, expressed their opinions successively. They generally agreed with the proposal, but all believed that peace or war was the most important issue at present, and that the reform of politics, party affairs, and the military was particularly important. Although reform plans had been repeatedly proposed in the past, they lacked the spirit of vigorous implementation. Now that the policy direction of the responsible cabinet of the Executive Yuan had not yet been formulated, the essential task of reform could begin with the policy direction. As for the reform of party affairs, it could be formulated based on the policy direction. Some participants believed that reform lies in determination, and it is never too late to start reforming from tomorrow. Subsequently, relevant issues regarding peace talks, such as the selection of representatives, the modalities of negotiations, locations, and scope, were discussed in detail, but no conclusions were reached. Only the ratification of the Executive Yuan's resolution was passed. Finally, several personnel appointments and removals were approved, and the meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Wu Tiecheng, concurrently the Minister of Foreign Affairs, reported at the Kuomintang Central Political Council on the government's inquiry to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union regarding the possibility of negotiating peace with the Chinese Communist Party and exploring the possibility of mediation by each country. At the same time, Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Information Department and spokesperson for the ministry, issued a statement at a press conference as follows: "Chairman's New Year's Day message demonstrates his determination to restore peace. In order to explain the sincerity of our government and people in restoring peace, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent identical memoranda to the governments of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union on the 8th of this month, expressing our government's willingness to hear the opinions of the governments concerned regarding our government's sincerity for peace, and willing to start peace negotiations with the Communist Party through their mediation. The four governments have now replied successively, all stating that they sincerely wish China to restore peace as soon as possible, but under the current circumstances, it is difficult to serve as mediators."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of Transportation's evacuation plan will be implemented on the 21st. Special trains, planes, and transport ships will be prepared to carry government personnel and documents to Taiwan, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and various cities in South China. Each ministry may retain 10% or 20% of its staff to work, and they will evacuate at the last moment. The first batch of evacuees from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will leave Nanjing on the 21st. Formal orders for the relocation of the Navy and Air Force Headquarters to Taiwan and the Army Headquarters to Guangzhou have been issued.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 20th] The Taiwan Office of the Air Force Headquarters has now been established, with Hao Zhonghe concurrently serving as the Director. The Air Force Training Command has also been relocated to Tainan, and other Air Force hospitals and repair facilities have been moved to Taiwan.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 20th] Guangdong Chairman Soong Tzu-wen was summoned by the President and flew to Nanjing on a special plane at 10:00 AM today, and is expected to return to Guangzhou in about three days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Soong Tzu-wen arrived in Nanjing at 3:00 PM on the 20th. After resting briefly at his private residence, he paid a visit to the President at 7:00 PM and also visited ambassadors, with whom he spoke at length. When Soong arrived in Nanjing, Zhu Shaoliang and others went to the airport to welcome him.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, Daily] Fang Tian, upon learning of the Executive Yuan's passage of his appointment as Chairman of Jiangxi Province last night, stated that the current situation in Jiangxi is fraught with difficulties, especially in terms of funding. He also stated that he has telegraphed the Central Government to resign. Hu Jiafeng will remain in Nanjing as Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidential Office. However, when Hu spoke to the Provincial Government on the phone on the morning of the 20th, he indicated that he was still considering and would return to Jiangxi in the coming days. Hong Gui, Director of the Department of Finance, flew to Shanghai this afternoon and then to Nanjing to discuss the budget for the 38th year of the Republic (1949) in Jiangxi and how to resolve Jiangxi's financial difficulties in the future with the Ministry of Finance. According to one observer, Fang Tian's resignation is indeed his true intention. If the Central Government telegraphed him again to retain him, he might still take office, and the candidates for provincial committee members and department heads might be able to continue in their positions.</p>

<p>Washington Receives Report from the U.S. Embassy</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Under Secretary of State Lovett said: "The State Department received a telegram from the U.S. Embassy in China this morning, but the contents were not explained." When asked about the rumor that the Chinese government had requested all embassies to relocate south with them, Lovett replied that if this were the case, Ambassador Stuart would consult with other foreign envoys in China nearby, while the State Department would seek the opinions of the relevant governments. According to informed sources, foreign envoys in Nanjing have already begun discussing the matter, but it is not yet known whether the United States will accept the Chinese government's suggestion and instruct the U.S. Embassy in China to relocate south with them. Diplomatic authorities believe that the U.S. Embassy may send a portion of its staff to relocate south with them, while the rest will remain in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The State Department said on the 19th that 240 Americans, including military personnel, are currently residing in Nanjing. Among them, 154 are U.S. officials and their families. If the U.S. Embassy relocates, they will also evacuate to Guangzhou, but there are some indications that at least some officials will remain there even after Nanjing falls to the Communists.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 20th] It is reported that the National troops in Gaoyou have taken the initiative to withdraw, and public school teachers are arriving in Yangzhou one after another. It is rumored that the National troops are still firmly defending Lujin Town on the Grand Canal line, and the Communist bandits have not dared to enter the city. The situation in Yangzhou is very tranquil, but many non-combatant organizations have already dispersed, and wealthy citizens are moving south one after another. Prices have generally fallen for days, and the special train chartered by the banking sector to the town is ridiculously expensive at 50,000 yuan. Cinemas and theaters in the city are operating as usual, and newspapers are also being published as usual. Water and land transportation between Zhenjiang and Yangzhou is smooth, and military and political leaders are still stationed in Yangzhou, occasionally patrolling the streets, giving people extreme excitement.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 20th] As the situation in northern Jiangsu becomes tense, military and political organs, banks, and post offices in Yangzhou, Taixian, and Gaoyou have been relocating south to Zhenjiang one after another. Ships and automobiles have been requisitioned, and thousands of refugees are gathered at Liuwei. When reporters went there on the 20th, they witnessed them eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, unable to board ships to come south, and the situation was extremely tragic. It is hoped that the shipping administration authorities will dispatch ships to rush to transport them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 20th] The garrison forces in Hai'an Town on the Tongyu Line took the initiative to withdraw today, and the National troops protected the people along the way as they evacuated south. The area between Tongzhou and Rugao is still peaceful.</p>

Various agencies have begun to disperse their families, and national banks and bureaus have suspended most of their operations due to staff shortages.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] In order to adapt to the current situation, the Nantong County Government has ordered the self-defense forces in various districts to concentrate and establish two self-defense district headquarters to facilitate flexible deployment.</p>

They launched five ferocious attacks against the highlands north of Qiugou using human wave tactics, and suffered another miserable defeat before dawn on the 20th. According to preliminary estimates, the bandits suffered more than 1,500 casualties. The bandits harassing the area south of Zhaobi Tomb and south of Songzhuang in the southeast of the city, and the area east of San'er Tree in the east of the city, were all ambushed by the National troops and fled in defeat.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] The British Foreign Office officially denied on the 19th the claim that the British government is preparing to recognize the CCP government. According to informed sources, it is too early to predict what decisions the British government will make when the CCP achieves final victory. The British government's current Far East policy is to "wait and see". The current situation is chaotic and unpredictable, and it is not yet time to make predictions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th, United Press] It is reported that the units of the British Commonwealth agree with Britain's strict neutral attitude towards China.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Shen Changhuan, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, formally denied all rumors about President Chiang's movements to reporters on the 20th. Shen had just returned from the President's residence when he attended the press conference, but he was immediately troubled by telephone inquiries from various parties about the President's movements. Therefore, he made a statement on this issue at the press conference. A reporter asked when President Chiang would go to Guangzhou. Shen said: "I have never heard of any news about this matter." Shen also denied rumors that the President was traveling and that the Central Political Council was discussing the President's advance or retreat. These rumors had been spreading in the capital since 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th, and a few newspapers had even published extra editions based on them, which caused the citizens to feel slightly bewildered. However, these rumors were soon proven to be inaccurate. When some reporters inquired about the relationship between the Executive Yuan's statement on the 19th and the Central Political Council's discussion of the current situation on the 20th, Shen replied: "Since the President issued a New Year's Day message expressing his desire for peace, the national response has been very good. People's organizations such as provincial and municipal councils have appealed to the government and the CCP to cease fire first, and then begin peace talks. In order to comply with the wishes of the people, the Executive Yuan issued a statement on the 19th, expressing the government's willingness to immediately and unconditionally cease fire with the CCP and to appoint representatives to begin peace talks. This move fully demonstrates that the government has taken a further step towards seeking peace, and once again proves the government's sincerity in restoring peace as soon as possible. The Central Political Council meeting on the morning of the 20th discussed the current situation extensively and ratified the Executive Yuan's resolution yesterday. There were no other decisions, and all other rumors are purely false."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] President Chiang summoned Wu Tiecheng, Zheng Yanfen, Huang Shaogu, and others on the afternoon of the 20th. At 4:00 PM, he summoned Guan Linzheng. At 7:00 PM in the evening, he hosted a banquet for Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing and officials above the rank of director of the Navy Headquarters to show his concern. He also scheduled to meet with Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and others on the morning of the 21st.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Situation in Beiping Regarding Peace or War is Confused and Uncertain: Foreign Wire Reports Say That the Outline of a Ceasefire Agreement Has Been Agreed Upon, But the Communist Army Still Fires Cold Shots into the City from Time to Time <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4:30 PM, 20th] Ten representatives of the North China People's Peace Promotion Association went out of the city to the western suburbs of Haidian (where Yenching University is located) the day before yesterday to negotiate with the Communist side, especially on the Beiping issue, and obtained considerable results. It is reported that on the evening of their arrival in Haidian, they formally handed over to the Communist representatives the telegram from the speakers of the seven provinces and cities to Mao Zedong, appealing for cooperation with Fu Zuoyi. The Communist representatives said that they would forward it immediately. The next morning, they continued to negotiate on the ceasefire issue. The Communist side said that there had been no fighting in recent days, which was equivalent to a "truce". As for the issue of not firing "cold shots" into the city, the Communist side promised to convey it to the commanders of the Communist army units for attention. The date of the ceasefire was not definitely limited to ten days. How the Beiping peace talks would continue after the ceasefire was not discussed in detail, but many believe that there must be other ways to explore. In addition, the ten representatives elaborated on Commander-in-Chief Fu's advocacy of political democracy, economic equality, and freedom of life, as well as his diligence, hard work, integrity, and non-corruption style, which aroused much heated debate. He Siyuan spoke the most among the delegation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7:30 PM, 20th] There were occasional sounds of artillery in the suburbs of Beiping last night and this morning, but there was no formal contact. After the peace envoys returned from the western suburbs yesterday, they showed that local peace was proceeding through another channel. Some people working for peace are working hard on this matter, and it is not far from maturity. The atmosphere of peace or war is gradually decreasing. It is said that the demolition of civilian houses in the suburbs will be stopped, and the inspection of city gates will also be relaxed. However, the intermittent loud noises of explosions at midnight to repair the airport and remove obstacles still make it difficult for people to sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shanghai, News, 20th] The United Press correspondent in Beiping passed through news censorship this morning and sent the following outline of the Beiping ceasefire agreement: (1) Beiping and Gui Sui are handed over to the Communist army; (2) Fu Zuoyi resigns and is succeeded by Deng Baoshan. Fu is no longer regarded as a war criminal in North China. Other generals are free to stay or leave; (3) Fu's troops are renamed the "Democratic Self-Defense Army", which is not directly commanded by the Communist army, and may eventually be disbanded; (4) The agreement will be implemented on January 20 or 21, so that the Communist army can enter Beiping in time to prepare for celebrations during the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 20th] The peace or destruction of Beiping reached its peak of disturbance on the 20th due to the return of the peace delegation, and rumors abounded. Although the delegation refused to formally disclose the results of its negotiations with the Communist side, individuals were free to make statements to the press, so that today's newspapers are full of various and even contradictory news, which almost makes people believe that the delegates of the delegation attended different meetings separately. One representative said: "The Communist army agreed to a ceasefire of ten days to wait for peace talks." Another representative later said: "The Communist army pointed out that Beiping is actually on ceasefire because the Communist army is not attacking the city and there are many opportunities for peace talks."</p>
<p>According to the statements made by the representatives and the news published in the newspapers, the situation of the peace talks should be as follows: This meeting was not the highest-level one. Communist Commander Ye Jianying and senior Communist generals did not attend. It is said that they have gone to Tianjin. Although some representatives claimed that the participants in the talks were "senior Communist army officers", one representative privately admitted that the Communist representatives who attended the meeting were only non-commissioned officers. The meeting continued until 11:00 PM, and resumed the next morning and ended at 11:00 AM. The Communist side hosted a grand banquet at the first meeting and the attitude was greatly improved at the second meeting.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the Communist army participants do not have the authority to allow a ceasefire. One representative said: "The Communist army agreed to stop bombing the city." But another representative said: "The Communist side pointed out that 'in the continuation of the war, some stray bullets inside the city are inevitable'."</p>
<p>There were still stray bullets falling in the city on the evening of the 19th, but none on the morning of the 20th, but the sounds of machine guns from the suburbs showed that there was no full ceasefire.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Deng Wenyi, spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, declared on the 20th: "After the end of the Battle of Tianjin, the garrison troops in Tanggu have safely withdrawn to designated locations by ship. Only one battalion was lost during the withdrawal. Most of the two armies of the Tianjin garrison were lost. The bandits under Lin Biao suffered at least 65,000 casualties in the Battle of Tianjin. Now, Lin Biao has transferred four columns from Tianjin to Beiping. There are currently twelve columns of bandits in the area near Beiping."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 20th] The suburbs of Beiping were quiet all day today. There was no contact between the two sides, but the Communist army still fired cold shots into the city from time to time.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chuxian, 20th] The Mingguang front section of the southern Jinpu Railway has been calm in recent days. The train between Mingguang and Pukou is still running smoothly. The two regiments of the Jianghuai Independent Brigade of bandits, which had previously fled to the old home mountain area 30 miles northeast of Zhangbaling Station, have been completely driven away by the National troops. Since the regular troops of the National Army withdrew from Bengbu, officials now acknowledge that a local Communist force has entered the city area. In addition, Li Yannian, commander of the Army Corps, is still stationed here.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] According to aerial reconnaissance: The Communist troops crossing the Huai River entered the Bengbu city area in succession from both the east and west sides today, and the number is close to one column. Hefei is as peaceful as usual.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Deng Wenyi, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, announced on the 20th in response to reporters' inquiries that the National troops in Bengbu had completely withdrawn on the evening of the 19th, and the main force of the bandits has not yet entered Bengbu. The Xuzhou Bandit Suppression General Headquarters was also abolished on the 19th. Currently, the military affairs north of the Yangtze River are commanded by Li Yannian, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison and Commander of the Sixth Army Corps.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chuxian, 20th] After the Capital Garrison General Headquarters' Command Post in Chuzhou withdrew to Nanjing to await orders, the department recently established another command post in the Liangpu (Pukou and Puzhen) area north of the Yangtze River, with Commander Liu Bingzhe concurrently serving as commander, responsible for maintaining security and transportation in the area.</p>

<p>A Platoon Attached Escaped from the Bandit Area and Reported</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chuxian, 20th] According to Feng Yuwen, a platoon attached of the former National Army Armored Corps who escaped from the bandit area: He was originally a subordinate of Lieutenant Colonel Chiang Wei-kuo. After being captured by the bandits, he was later assigned to be the driver of Liu Bocheng's private car. Liu always wears dark glasses when going out. He did not know at first that the owner of his car was the bandit Liu until he was told by others more than a month later. Feng also said that Liu Bocheng was indeed blown to death by the National Air Force while directing the battle on a car near Taoyuanji, Suxian County, a month ago. Chen Yi also suffered minor injuries to his leg. Although this news has not been formally announced in the bandit army, all bandit armies know this fact. On January 10, when the National Army broke through at Qinglongji, after the Deputy Commander of the Xuzhou Bandit Suppression General Headquarters, Du Yuming, was captured, according to unconfirmed news (the news of Liu's death has been confirmed), the bandits executed Du to vent their anger in retaliation for the death of Liu Bocheng.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 20th] Military News: (1) The bandit troops in southern Henan, northern Hubei, and central Hubei have been moving frequently recently.

(2) More than 10,000 unidentified bandit troops were found near Luohe and Runan on the 18th, with intentions of invading south. In addition: 30,000 wounded bandit troops are gathered along the Shahe (Yingshui River) coast in Huaidian, Jieshou, and other places, and some have moved south.

<h3 id="e17">Although the Communists Disregard the People's Desire for Peace, the Nationalists Adopt a Defensive and Responsive Strategy - The Ministry of National Defense Political Warfare Bureau Releases a Weekly War Situation Report - <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of National Defense Political Warfare Bureau recently released a weekly war situation report from the 13th to the 19th, stating: At the beginning of the week, although the Communist Party put forward conditions for responding to the President's New Year's Day message, it continued to fiercely attack Tianjin, disregarding the peace wishes of the people across the country. However, the National Army was able to follow the instructions of the General Headquarters in all battlefields, adopting a defensive and responsive strategy, not taking the initiative in offensives, while actively adjusting deployments and consolidating new positions. In case the Communist Party disregards the peace wishes of the people across the country, for the sake of the people's wishes, we will not hesitate to continue a protracted war until the Communist side realizes its errors or achieves complete victory.</p>
<p>(1) North China Battlefield: In the Tianjin area, Lin Biao concentrated all his main forces to attack Tianjin, launching an offensive on the 6th of this month. On the 14th and 15th, he launched a fierce offensive against the National Army's positions in Tianjin. Fierce fighting took place in the Xiyingmen area. Due to the National Army's limited strength, it was forced to switch to an inner-line defense and continue fighting the bandits. The main forces of Lin Biao's units, including the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 12th Columns, were about four times the size of the Tianjin garrison. The Communist bandits suffered extremely heavy casualties. The fighting continued until the evening of the 15th before it ended. Statistics show that the Tianjin defense battle lasted 29 days, and the main forces of both sides fought for 10 days. The bandit army suffered more than 65,000 casualties. The National Army regarded Tianjin as the essence of industry and commerce in North China and could not bear excessive damage. While doing its best to fight the bandits, it also did its best to protect the lives and property of the citizens, so it was greatly affected strategically. The National Army's forbearance and burden-bearing in Tianjin resulted in losses. Due to the changes in the Tianjin battle situation, the National Army in the Tanggu area has safely withdrawn and transferred to designated areas by naval vessels in order to adapt to the new strategy. Around Beiping, there have only been minor contacts in recent days. Although people from all walks of life are doing their best to call for the preservation of this cultural capital, it is still a big question whether the Communist Party can restrain its troops to comply with the people's demands, because the Communist army seems to still be actively preparing to attack the city in recent days. Four columns of Lin Biao's troops near Tianjin have concentrated in the suburbs of Beiping.</p>
<p>(2) East China Battlefield: Since the end of the Xiaoyong area battle, the National Army immediately redeployed to prevent the Communist army's conspiracy of negotiating peace on one hand and attacking on the other. After a slight reorganization, it continued to invade southward. Now the National Army has actively withdrawn from various strongholds on the north bank of the Huai River to the new defensive positions south of the Huai River and north of the Yangtze River, adopting a defensive posture, deploying heavy troops, and maneuvering at any time as a vanguard base for the Yangtze River defense line. As of the 18th, the Bengbu Linhuaiguan area was still in the hands of the National Army. Small units of the Communist army carried out sneak crossings, and local battles occurred. On the north bank of the Huai River, the Communist army has suffered heavy losses to its main forces in recent months, and supply is difficult. In the short term, it seems unlikely to make large-scale movements. As for the south bank of the Huai River, the National Army is clearing out scattered bandits and deploying defense lines. Judging from the current situation, the defense of the Jiangbei area is very solid. The government and the people across the country currently desire the realization of peace, but preparations for war have not been relaxed in the slightest, adopting the principle of preparing for war while seeking peace, rather than seeking peace and forgetting war. Earlier this month, the Communist Party issued an emergency "conscription order," limiting the time to before February 15 of this year, requiring all areas in North China to conscript as many able-bodied men aged 16 to 48 as possible, totaling one million, forcing them to be sent to Handan, Hebei, for centralized training in preparation for becoming sacrificial tools for future human-wave tactics. In other areas, the Communist Party is still actively using terrorist policies and rumor offensives as the vanguard of its field troops. Therefore, peace cannot be achieved by one side alone. If the Communist Party disregards the future of the country and the nation, and disregards the wishes of the people across the country, continuing its military speculation, the government, in order to strive for the independence and freedom of the country and the nation, and to protect the people's free way of life, will not hesitate to engage in long-term warfare.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Looking Forward to the Improvement of US-Soviet Relations <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>President Truman was inaugurated as the 33rd President yesterday and delivered an inaugural address, saying that he will do his best to promote the Democratic Party's platform and seek world peace for mankind; at the same time, he also emphasized that the friendship of all mankind should go hand in hand with other sacred virtues of human behavior. The speech was short, lasting only fifteen minutes, and was broadcast worldwide via radio. In today's turbulent world situation, people from all countries around the world have heard President Truman's call for peace and regard it as a ray of sunshine piercing through the international haze, and place infinite hope in it.</p>
<p>Looking back at international politics since the end of World War II, it is not difficult to prove that the crux of today's international problems lies in the irreconcilable differences between the United States and the Soviet Union. If the two world powers can one day resolve their suspicions and restore the spirit of fighting side by side during the war to win victory, then all current international problems will be easily solved. Based on this correct understanding, people unanimously believe that if the world is to achieve true peace, it is necessary to first seek coordination between the United States and the Soviet Union. Since President Truman has taken the creation of world peace as his own responsibility, what he must first strive for is to seek understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union. On the eve of President Truman's inauguration, the Soviet Union had already published an article in the "News Report" issued by the Soviet Embassy in the United States, advocating "mutual understanding to promote friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union." Although this article can be regarded as the Soviet Union's "peace offensive," it may not be impossible as an opportunity for the transformation of US-Soviet relations, which is worthy of the world's attention. Acting Secretary of State Lovett also made a statement on the 19th, saying that the United States welcomes the Soviet Union to prove its sincerity for peace with a constructive cooperative attitude, and hopes that the Soviet Union can adopt a more cooperative attitude on the Berlin blockade issue and the Austrian peace treaty issue.</p>
<p>Judging from Lovett's remarks, there is still a considerable distance between the United States and the Soviet Union, and it is not possible to improve relations between the two countries overnight; but President Truman promised voters during the election that he would strive to achieve understanding with Soviet leaders in the next four years to ensure world peace; now that he has just taken office, he should work hard in this direction in order to fulfill his promises and live up to the expectations of voters; otherwise, the opposition party will definitely use this as an excuse to attack the Truman government, not to mention that the Executive Committee of the American Progressive Party has already issued a declaration demanding that President Truman implement his statement of "we all need peace" and meet directly with Stalin to negotiate the basic conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, looking at the general trend, the US government will definitely try its best to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union in the future. Recently, Secretary of State Marshall's resignation, with the vacancy filled by Acheson, can indeed be regarded as a prelude to American diplomacy pointing in a new direction.</p>
<p>At present, although the US government and the public are still full of anti-communist and anti-Soviet rhetoric, which is enough to hinder the development of the movement to improve US-Soviet relations; however, reviewing the US's two-year-long diplomacy towards the Soviet Union, one cannot but admit that the use of American diplomacy has indeed failed to be completely satisfactory. To be fair, the so-called Truman Doctrine and the so-called Marshall Plan, from the perspective of the US's anti-communist and anti-Soviet stance, are indeed a tough method; but in terms of the peace of the whole world, what are the consequences? It is worthy of in-depth study; moreover, the State Department often hesitates when implementing it, and cannot act vigorously and thoroughly achieve its goals; it cannot even be universally promoted, forgetting the integrity of the world, and distinguishing between Europe and Asia, achieving some achievements in Europe, but reducing its significance due to the backwardness in Asia. Therefore, today's America, unless it ignores everything and acts recklessly to the end, it must consider how to improve relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In short, US-Soviet cooperation is a prerequisite for world peace. Whether it is the people of all countries in the world, or the people of the United States and the Soviet Union themselves, as long as they love peace and hate war, they all hope that the United States and the Soviet Union can resolve their suspicions and promote friendship between the two countries with sincerity and goodwill. However, the opportunity to improve US-Soviet relations, like other opportunities, is fleeting; now that there is this new brewing in the international community, which is conducive to the development of good relations between the two countries, we should naturally hope that both the United States and the Soviet Union can especially cherish this good opportunity, face reality squarely, seize the opportunity, immediately improve US-Soviet relations, reverse the international trend, and make the whole world turn hostility into peace and harmony.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Truman Delivers Inaugural Address, Unveils Four Diplomatic Principles, Emphasizing Winning Through Bloodless Struggle <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] President Truman, taking office today, declared that our faith in democracy can defeat communism and all its evils, and win peace in the future. Truman was sworn in as the 33rd President of the United States today in a solemn ceremony here. After that, he delivered an inaugural address, urging the nation to have faith and strive for victory through a bloodless struggle. He also said that this struggle should be initiated by us. The President announced four principles of foreign policy today, saying that these four principles will make all free countries strong and prosperous, dispel the illusions of communist countries, and coexist peacefully with us. This afternoon, Barkley was sworn in as Vice President under the supervision of Judge Lee, and Truman was sworn in as President under the supervision of Chief Justice Vinson of the Supreme Court. Millions of people gathered in this colorful square today to witness this historic scene and the street parade. When Truman placed his left hand on two Bibles and swore "I will support and protect the Constitution," the crowd cheered enthusiastically. The President's inaugural address barely mentioned domestic issues, but emphasized winning the Cold War without letting it evolve into a real war. President Truman did not directly mention the Soviet Union today, but he made lengthy, sharp, and detailed criticisms of communism. He compared communism and democracy point by point, making a clear comparison between the shortcomings of communism's false philosophy and the advantages of the American democratic way of life. He also emphasized that the United States hopes for peace above all else, but he immediately stated that peace cannot be achieved by "appeasing the Communist Party," but only by strengthening the strength of free countries in economic, military, and social aspects. He also said that people in other countries around the world, including those under communist leadership, are waiting anxiously for future developments, and waiting for the friendship and assistance of the United States, as well as wise leadership, with an anxiety never seen before. He then declared the four principles of the "Peace and Freedom" plan, saying that the US foreign policy for the next four years will be based on these four principles. The four principles are: (1) Continue to support the United Nations; (2) Do our best to support the European Recovery Program; (3) Strengthen the strength of free countries through collective defense treaties and military assistance to Western Europe, so that aggressors dare not covet life; (4) Assist backward countries with strong forces, so that they become prosperous democratic countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] President Truman's oath is as follows: "I solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." When Truman took the oath, he used two Bibles, harmonizing religious sentiments and love for his homeland. His left hand touched the two books from time to time. The small Bible was placed on top of the opened large Bible. This small Bible was the one he used when he was sworn in as President after Roosevelt's death on April 12, 1945. The large Bible is the original Gutenberg Bible, which has a history of 493 years.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Key Points of Truman's Speech: Strengthening Democratic Forces as Policy Goal, Willing to Live Together in Peaceful Coordination <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] The key points of President Truman's inaugural address are as follows: Today is not only the beginning of a new government taking office, but also the beginning of a period that will ultimately determine the future of us and the world. The most important need for us today is that the world faces a serious situation in the future, and how it will develop is unknown. At this time of rampant suspicion, the world's expectations for America's goodwill, strength, and wise leadership are greater than ever. Therefore, we should declare the main principles we trust and our goals at this time.</p>
<p>Conflict of Ideologies</p>
<p>Most importantly, we hope for a fair and lasting peace, and we will do our best to achieve it. And this kind of peace should be based on equal status, free discussion, and genuine agreement. In pursuit of this goal, the United States and other like-minded countries have noticed that they are directly facing a regime that is contrary to our goals, and whose life concepts are completely different from ours. This false philosophy is communism. Communism believes that the division of the world into hostile classes is inevitable, while democracy believes that free countries can fairly resolve differences and maintain lasting peace. A year ago, we and sixteen free European countries launched the most ambitious economic cooperation plan in history. The purpose of this work is to strengthen the strength of democratic Europe, so that the free people on the continent can contribute to the safety and well-being of the world in their correct position in civilization. Our efforts have restored hope to mankind, we have repelled defeatism, and we have spared some countries from losing their freedom. Millions of people around the world share the same view with us, that is, we do not need war, we can achieve peace, and we have the power to initiate it. In the next few years, our peace and freedom plan will focus on the following four points:</p>
<p>Four Principles</p>
<p>That is (1) continue to firmly support the United Nations, seek ways to strengthen its prestige and increase its power. (2) Continue the world economic recovery plan, that is, we must first fully support the aid-to-Europe plan. We firmly believe that this major attempt at world recovery will be successful, and countries cooperating with us can restore their self-sufficiency. (3) We will strengthen peace-loving countries to resist the crisis of aggression. We are now entering into agreements with several countries to strengthen the security of the North Atlantic. This type of agreement is a collective defense measure within the scope of the United Nations Charter. We have already established this defense agreement for the Western Hemisphere in the Rio de Janeiro Treaty. The basic purpose of this agreement is to express the common determination of free countries to jointly resist armed attacks. I hope to submit it to the Senate soon. Regarding the treaty on the North Atlantic Security Plan, (4) We must launch a bold new plan to use scientific progress and industrial development to develop backward areas. Our purpose should be to assist free people to increase production through their own efforts.</p>
<p>Prosperity and Freedom</p>
<p>The exploitative behavior of imperialism in the past has no place in our plans. The proper utilization of world resources will benefit all countries in the world, including the United States. According to past experience, as other countries progress in industry and economy, the trade between the United States and these countries will also increase. Increasing production is a basic condition for prosperity and peace. Based on the above four ways, we hope to help all mankind to obtain freedom and happiness.

About one-quarter of the rice that all rice merchants should hand over to the government has also been allocated and paid, totaling 500 city shi (bushels).

The Social Affairs Bureau will send a letter to the Central Bank to notify the China Textile Company to allocate it accordingly.

After the meeting, he met with the President and reported on the situation in Shanghai. In order to prepare for emergencies, the President agreed to keep the rice supply in Shanghai at a sufficient level at all times. There will be no problem with food supply in the city for three months. Another three months of grain will be stored. The Central Bank can allocate 500 million yuan for grain storage. In addition, fuel, cooking oil, and other items must also be fully prepared. Regarding the policy of high-priced rice allocation, Mayor Wu said that in order to enrich the source, the principle of adjusting the allocation price according to the market price will not be changed. However, the technical problems of rice allocation still need to be discussed and improved. The rice should be delivered as quickly as possible, and the retail rice shops will also be strictly managed. When asked by reporters whether the issue of evacuating civil servants in the city had been discussed by the central government, the mayor said that this was absolutely not the case, saying that it was not yet time to talk about it. If the situation suddenly becomes tense, the city government will be responsible for finding temporary relief measures for employees. The Executive Yuan has agreed that the Central Bank can allocate funds for evacuation at that time. As for the rumors of the government moving the capital, Wu said that he had not heard of it.</p>

<h3 id="e79">The Material Supply Committee Announces the Reasons for the Delayed Allocation of Coal Briquettes and Cooking Oil to Civil Servants and Teachers, Allocation Can Be Made Around the Lunar New Year <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the reasons for the delayed allocation of coal briquettes and cooking oil to civil servants and teachers, Zeng Gangfu, the chief secretary of the Municipal Civil Servants and Teachers Material Supply Committee, issued a statement yesterday, explaining that the delay was due to: (1) The supply of cooking oil for civil servants and teachers was previously designated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to be the responsibility of the China Vegetable Oil Factory. Due to the continuous rise in prices, the factory stipulated that transactions must be made in cash, which delayed the process of allocating funds. The factory, in view of the urgent need for oil by civil servants and teachers, is preparing to first allocate one month's worth of oil for November to meet the urgent need. After repeated negotiations, it was decided to start selling it on February 2. (2) After the end of the Public Utility Coal Allocation Committee, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce designated the Shanghai Office of the Anthracite Coal Adjustment Committee to be responsible for handling the allocation of coal. The committee entrusted the joint management office of the Kailuan, East China, Huainan, and Taiwan mines to handle the supply business. However, the coal briquettes and the difference in price were all advanced by the joint management office of the four mines and have not yet been allocated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. After submitting separate letters urging payment, it is now learned that the Executive Yuan has already allocated the funds. Once they arrive in Shanghai, the allocation can be carried out within a week, around the Lunar New Year. (3) Before November of last year, civil servant and teacher in-kind purchase certificates were issued at the end of each month, and the shopping period ended on the 20th of the following month. Since December, the committee has issued them earlier at the beginning of the month, and the shopping period ends at the end of the month, which has resulted in another month's delay in the allocation of coal briquettes and cooking oil. (4) The committee is only responsible for verifying the number of people, checking the reimbursement, and issuing purchase certificates. The actual supply of materials is handled separately by the relevant ministries and commissions designated by the Executive Yuan. Rice is supplied by the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. Coal briquettes, cooking oil, and cloth are supplied by the Shanghai Office of the Anthracite Coal Adjustment Committee, the China Vegetable Oil Factory, and the China Textile Company. Sugar is supplied by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation of the Resources Committee. Salt is supplied by the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance. The prices of all allocated materials are also directly allocated by the Executive Yuan to various ministries and commissions and then distributed to the various supply agencies.</p>

<p>Du Zhisheng, a native of Huaiyin living at 465 Jiangyin Street in this city, was previously arrested by Pan Yunlong, a member of the 3rd Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, for committing an assault case. Therefore, Du harbored hatred for Pan and planned to retaliate. On June 2 last year, Pan was riding in a pedicab with his wife when he was suddenly seen by Du in front of the Dafugui Restaurant on Zhonghua Road. He gathered a crowd to beat Pan, causing Pan to suffer serious injuries. Pan reported the incident to the police bureau. On December 16 last year, Du secretly returned home, thinking that the matter had passed, but was caught by the police bureau who arrived after hearing the news. He was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office and prosecuted for attempted murder. The case was publicly tried for the first time yesterday by Judge Hua of the District Court. As a result, the court ordered the case to be adjourned for further investigation due to the need for further investigation of the case.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Xin Xianlin and Qunli Equally Share the Nanshi Championship, Extended Time Resulted in a 2-2 Tie <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's Nanshi football final, Xin Xianlin faced Qunli. In the first half, Xue Peiran of Xin Xianlin scored two goals. In the second half, Xin Xianlin was saving a dangerous ball in front of the goal, and Gao Baozheng accidentally scored an own goal. Then, Chen Longquan of Qunli took a free kick and directly hit the target, tying the score at 2-2. At the end of the time, the score was tied, so the time was extended for 30 minutes to determine the final outcome. As a result, there were no gains, and the original record was maintained. Since the Lunar New Year is approaching, it was decided to divide the championship equally and no longer replay the game. The sports venue also added a silver cup and presented it to both sides for encouragement. More than 1,200 people watched yesterday's game, and their generosity was commendable.</p>
<p>Gao Baozheng of Xin Xianlin performed the best. Wu Kaimin and Xue Peiran were also very colorful. In terms of the front line, Xiao Ziwen, Lu Qingxiang, and Chen Qin were all very dedicated. It is a pity that center Fei Chunlin was weak, and goalkeeper Zhu Xinzhang was also poor, otherwise, they might have won the championship. Everyone in Qunli worked hard. The counterattack in the second half showed the strength of the group. Xi Boming's goalkeeping was obviously superior to the opponent, and it was not in vain to share the championship.</p>
<p>After the start of the game, Xin Xianlin's offensive was quite strong. After eleven minutes, Xue Peiran took a long shot in front of the goal, opening the scoring. After twenty-eight minutes, Xiao Ziwen took two corner kicks, and the second time he crossed, Xue Peiran headed in with his back, "Great."</p>
<p>Changing positions and fighting again, Qunli changed from defense to offense. In less than three minutes, a group of people were squeezed in front of Xin Xianlin's goal. The ball was only two yards away from the goal. In this critical situation, Gao Baozheng stepped forward to rescue, but his toe touched it and it turned into an own goal. Twenty-nine minutes Chen Longquan opened a free kick at 30 yards in front of the Xin Xianlin gate and entered the net from the air. This has become a 2-2 tie, and the victory is undecided at the end of the time. Extend for 30 minutes, the record is as usual, both parties are happy and scattered.</p>

<p>As the Lunar New Year is approaching, the Municipal Postal Bureau, Telegraph Bureau, and International Radio Station, in order to strictly prohibit postmen and messengers or criminals from impersonating them to solicit holiday tips from all walks of life, are appealing to all sectors to cooperate in refusing to give tips. If it is discovered that postmen or messengers are soliciting tips while delivering mail or newspapers, the number and appearance of the postman or messenger can be noted and reported to the radio station in writing or by telephone. Once verified, in addition to being punished according to regulations, the informant will be rewarded with considerable remuneration. If, outside of delivery hours, someone in plain clothes impersonating a postman or messenger without delivering mail or telegrams attempts to swindle holiday tips from all walks of life, it is obviously a criminal impersonating them for extortion. The bureau and station hope that all sectors will send them directly to the police for handling.</p>

<h3 id="e102">No Progress in Export Situation After New Year Due to the Influence of the Current Situation; Export Control Committee Releases Semi-Monthly Export Overview <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>According to the Export Control Committee, the export situation in the second half of the New Year has not progressed with the New Year due to the current situation. In the past two weeks, prices in Shanghai have risen sharply, and inland ports such as Kunming, Rong, and Hankou have also reported price increases, with export goods increasing in price by one to two times compared to the end of last year. At the same time, domestic exchange rates have risen, which has affected general export trade.</p>
<p>The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates rose steadily in the first half of the month, which was quite encouraging for exports but affected the buying interest of importers. Therefore, the Central Bank issued Foreign Exchange Circular No. 170 on the 10th, stipulating the identity of buyers of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Except for those who hold import permits or those who have applied for import and are expected to be approved, ordinary people are not allowed to purchase them, in order to comply with the principle of import and export linkage and to prevent non-industry people from competing to purchase and arbitrage. As a result, after the 14th, the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates fell, even falling below the overseas remittance exchange rate. Exporters generally believe that the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates should at least maintain the level of overseas remittances; otherwise, exports will be sluggish.</p>
<p>As for foreign market conditions, most are stable. Pig bristles are showing promise in the UK. According to the latest telegram from the Bank of China in London, on the 7th, the import prices there were 24 shillings per pound for Chongqing No. 27 long bristles, 13.5 shillings for short bristles, 27.5 shillings for Hankou long bristles, 12 shillings for short bristles, 23 shillings for Shanghai No. 27 long bristles, 12 shillings for short bristles, 60 shillings for Tianjin No. 55 long bristles, 45 shillings for short bristles, and 40 shillings for No. 26 short bristles.</p>
<p>Due to the gradual recovery of various countries around the world after the war, the output of goods last year has increased significantly compared to the previous year, and therefore general countries attach importance to export trade. Japan is particularly active. Our authorities are paying close attention to exports. In addition to opening up private cash trade with Japan this year to increase Sino-Japanese commerce, other promotional measures are also being strengthened and discussed separately.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Discount and Loan Committee Passed 20 Loan Applications Yesterday <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>

<p>In addition, the Production and Export Business Loan Review Committee of the committee also held its ninth meeting on the same day, chaired by Lin Chongyong, to discuss 69 emergency industrial loan applications. Except for six rejections, 63 were approved. As for cases involving the purchase of finished products in emergency industrial loans, the committee has stopped processing them from today because the number of applications has been decreasing.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the National Bank Discount and Loan Committee has been handling emergency industrial loans, the number of applications approved has reached more than 230, with an amount exceeding 100 million yuan.

The overnight interest rate in the market fell to four cents, with few takers, and the prices in various commodity markets began to rise again.

In the afternoon market, due to a small decline in gold prices, public sentiment suddenly weakened. Furthermore, due to the strong atmosphere of peace, asking prices gradually declined, and the market became soft and chaotic. However, there were not many transactions.</p>
<p>Raw silk, because the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates was not good, foreign firms' appetite was not strong. However, due to the abundance of money supply, there was little willingness to sell. Moreover, because the artificial silk market improved, public sentiment was not small. Although transactions were sluggish, asking prices were unwilling to decline. Superior grade spot goods rose from 92,000 yuan to 96,000 yuan, still showing gains. The remaining Jili Gan Jing and others also showed gains.</p>

<p>The rice market was slightly weaker yesterday because Wuxi prices were soft, public sentiment was not strong, and rice stores' appetite was weak and sales were very dull. The market still quoted the original price of the previous day at the opening yesterday, but because it was not easy to sell, prices declined. Although superior white japonica rice in the Nanshi market still stood at the original price of 1,500 yuan, Bo Dao fell by 50 yuan, and early rice fell slightly by 20 to 30 yuan. Yin Yuan and Bai Yuan fell by 100 yuan because sales were out of season.

Peanuts were slightly replenished on the street, rising by more than 10%, with corn showing a firm hidden strength and green beans slightly rising.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The rising trend continued because the money supply continued to be loose, retail investors' appetite was very strong, and sellers maintained high prices.
