<h3>鐵路郵電運價資費　自下月起農月調整　立院通過照成本指數計算</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕鐵路郵電運價資費調整辦法，廿五日在立院經激烈之爭辯後，始吿通過，規定鐵路郵電運價資費得按成本指數調整，每一個月調整一次，自四月一日起實行，各事業機構且須於本年五月內切實裁汰冗員，緊縮開支，其人負編制應恢復戰前標準。至郵費因各地物價差異甚大，得按分區辦法規定。該案原爲政院咨送之「鐵路郵電按照成本指數調整運價資費辦法與相關實施辦法及試辦情形」而審議者。初步審查時，正値鐵路郵電當局依照該辦法逕行調整，引起立委之普遍憤怒，故審查時將原辦法完全撤銷，改爲照公敎人員生活指數調整。提交大會討論時，若干委員認爲應顧及各該畢業之成本，決定加派委員會同審查。第二次審查又將照公敎生活指數調整辦法推翻，恢復依成本指數計算，惟在成本指數之編製上較政院原案大打折扣。據審查委員之意見，修正公式較原提公式在價格上减低甚多，如鐵路係减低百分之廿，郵政係减低百分之卅一，電信减低百分之卅九。各委員並認爲欲减低成本，應切實裁汰各交通事業機構之冗員，緊縮開支，而西南西北生活程度較低物價較廉郵資則當分區比例規定，以减輕人民負擔。廿五日下午提出院會討論時，曾引起熱烈討論爭執，各委員對交通事業機關之腐化人員之冗濫特別注意。據稱，以京滬路爲例，戰前平均每公里僅有員工十八人，交部規定每公里應有廿四人，兩路局全長共四八二公里，依戰前標準只須八六七八人，即照交部規定亦只須一一五六八人，但該路現有員工達二三五八人，多出一萬餘人，員工開支佔成本百分之五十以上，故只有栽汰冗員，緊縮開支，不能减低成本减輕運價，故交通事業機構應裁汰冗員，緊縮開支，並限於本年五月內恢復戰前標準之決議，遂順利通過。會中經逐條討論，二讀通過後，即省略三讀手續，將該項鐵路郵電運價資費調整辦怯及有關本案應行改進事項全部通過</p>
<h3>調整辦法全文</h3>

<h3>陳誠自溪口抵台　朱紹良同行稍留再返榕</h3>
<p>〔本報台北廿五日電〕陳誠·朱紹良·嚴家淦等一行，廿五日午後四時三乘天雄號專機返抵台北。陳·朱兩氏係廿四日飛寗波轉溪口中謁蔣總統，俾留一宵，廿王日午後二時飛台。朱氏則因福州機塲正修理不能降落，故來台小住二三天再返榕。陳氏定廿六日接見記才，發表此行經過。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北廿五日電〕陳誠廿五日下午自溪口飛台北後，以書面答笑星各報記者稱：「余係廿三日自京抵滬，廿四日下午抵達溪口，在溪口住宿一宵，看見蔣總裁，身體精神都好，蔣總裁對於台灣並無任何指示，但希望力求後方安定，努力增加生產，俾人民生活得以改善」。陳氏於其書面談話中又稱：「在此困難期間，新閣能迅速組成，并將機構簡化，各方觀感均極良好，和談尚未開始，今後進展情形如何，此時尚難奉告」關於省級簡化問題，陳氏稱：「台省以業務機構為多，其無必要者，已經自動栽撤」。</p>
<h3>王世杰論台灣</h3>
<p>法理性質與日德不同　屬於我國已絕無問題</p>
<p>〔聯合社台北廿五日電〕前外長王世杰昨在扶輪社演說，力言中國政府有統治台灣之全部主權與自由。王氏此言顯在駁斥最近盛傳台灣命運將在未來對日和會中決定之說·王氏指出，台灣之法理性質，與日本·德國不同，其理由有三：（一）一九四一年十二月中國對日宣戰時，聲明意欲廢除台灣割讓日本之條約。（二）開羅會議，美·英·蘇同意於戰後將台灣交還中國。（三）一九四五年日本戰敗，簽訂無條件投降書，故合灣屬於中國，已絕無問題。合灣受日本帝國主義奴役歷五十年，故愛好和平之中國人必須集中力量，保衛該區，以防受另一次帝國主義浪潮襲擊。台灣人倘不防備第三國際指揮之中共攻擊，則將陷入另一黑暗時期，失去自由獨立。中共佔領區域並無自由，事實俱在，一部份自稱自由主義人物，對於北平與東北情况，巳緘口不提。</p>
<h3>白告爾抵港　作六日友好訪問</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港廿五日電〕美西太平洋艦隊總司令白吉爾少將，廿五日晨乘巡洋艦愛朶雷多號抵此，作六日之友好訪問，驅逐艦鄧肯號亦同來。白吉爾將訪問港督及英遠東艦隊司令布蘭德少將，並擬於三月廿九日赴上海。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州廿五日電〕宋子文廿五日晨乘佛山輪抵穗，同行者有宋夫人及許世璿，陸文瀾等·據接近宋氏人士稱，渠此來爲拜訪各友好。</p>
<h3>和談代表竟日商討　軍事首長與會談整軍問題　中共如定時地即兼程前往</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕政府和談代表，廿五日竟日集會，商討籌備有關和談各項問題，李代總統並參加討論。其內容頗廣泛，政府代表五人，除黄紹竑尙滯港外，章士剣亦已於廿四日夜車趕來晨十時卽應何應欽之邀，在國防部集會，除和談四代表外，並有徐永昌，桂永淸，周至柔，顧祝同等參加。何應欽主持，迄行後始畢。聞會議主題，可能題問與整軍問題有關。午後各代表略事休息後，至晚七時，復至門鷄閘何氏官邸晚餐，並績討論各項問題。九時，代總統亦涖臨與會，討論至午夜始散。據官方人主稱：政府和談代表指定每張，目前僅在聽候中共之消息，一俟中共指定地點及時間，與代表後，我代表團卽可兼程前往。和談之開始已指日可望，而政府方面，對和談之意見，李代總統及何院長均係一致，目前商討者，爲若干細節問題之準備。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿五日電〕此間盛傳和談代表十天內可啓程赴平，但官方尙不能證實。</p>

<h3>穩定安慶！</h3>
<p>正當和談聲浪不絕如縷的時候，長江中游的烽火復·又燃燒起來，這是萬分令人焦灼和憂悶的事。牘本報昨日南京專電說；江北共軍於整補究成後，頃已正式開始對國軍各橋頭陣地遂漸加深壓力，其中計自鄂皖邊境起，除裕溪口（蕪湖對岸），江浦，津浦南段兩浦地區，大河口（六合東南）尚機續保持平靜狀態，儀徵，十二圩，爪洲，施家橋仍有小接觸，口岸（泰縣南），潛山，太湖，望江等地以限於地形，於廿一日自動放棄外，其他安慶方面於廿二石起，發現有共軍萬餘開始由潛山高河埠分兩路南下，國軍且戰且退，現集結於安慶外圍集賢關西路灣山口鎮之綫（距安慶城各十餘里），展開激戰中。同時，本來在安慶辦公的皖省政府人員，也於此際開始取道蕪湖撤往屯溪，原任皖主席夏威將軍，因為要專管軍事，主席一職且經行政院發表張養純擔任。這些跡象，都說明皖中形勢確已至緊張階段，長江北岸的烽火已因共軍的積極進逼而很難避免的了。</p>
<p>皖償介於長江中游南北兩面，而地現形勝則　在北岸。皖省為長江的腹都，安慶乃其省會，面臨長江，它在地理的價值，是依長江淮河互為屏陣的。自從去歲徐蚌會戰，桐城合肥陷於共軍之手後，安慶形勢日孤，位置上有表無裹，成為長江中游的一庫橋頭堡陣地，控扼着首都的外圍。是故安慶的得失，關係首都地位及長江交通，極偽重大。明人顧詛禹在「讀史方與紀要」書中，會指出安慶地位的重要說：「安慶府淮服之屏障，江介之要衡。徐錯曰：皖之為地，中國（按，即中國）得之，可以制江表，江表得之，亦可惠中國。而小孤出舊為大江控扼處。蓋安慶者，金陵之門戶；小孤者，安慶之門戶」。顧祖禹根據金人入寇南爾下的歷史經騐，道破安慶與金陵的關係。清代太平夭國在軍事的失敗，亦由於失去安慶之險，在洪楊以為長江天塹，可保令陵無憂，實未能深切明瞭顧祖禹的警語。會國藩率領攻打太平天國的湘軍，團攻金陵，先取安慶為大營，結果則波江成功，而牧表裏之効，這是會國藩熱　歷史明瞭地理的成功。由上述的地理形勝與歷史演變看來，可知安慶之得失，決非安慶一隅之得失，是關保金陵命運和長江安全很大的。</p>
<p>我馴近代軍事政治家，尤其目前只知憑恃堅甲利兵的統將，相當忽路地理形勝和歷史經騐，往往鑄成大錯。去歲徐蚌之戰，棄淮而守江，陷安慶形勞於孤立，可說已鑄成大錯。昔人趙范有言：「有淮則有江，無淮則長江以北港汶蘆葦之處，敵人皆可潛師以濟，江面數千里，伺從而防載？「這說明秦淮守江，江已相當難守。現在共軍利用和談聲響的時機，利用過去兩三個月政府議論未定的時機，從淮河之交，準備輕取水陸衛　的安慶，深熟歷史事實，而首都軍政權要似乎未予軍視共軍的部署與企圖，可能再度鑄成大錯，以致不可收拾的。昔金兵分道入寇皖中甫渡，江淮危在旦夕，時丘崈為兩淮宜撫，有人勸崈棄廬和為守江計，密曰：「棄淮則與敵共長江之險，吾當與淮南俱存亡耳。」雖然大勢所趨，丘崈鏖戰失敗，但丘將軍之有見識，在戰史上寫下了他的光榮事蹟。這是足供後人深切猛省的。</p>
<p>看目下共軍態勢，在軍事上是打算各個　破上起武漢下迄南通北岸一綫的橋頭堡，為次一步的渡江東進關一條經便之路，在政治上以軍力作和談的後盾，意圍獲取絕亂優勢的和談條件，以收城下之盟的實效‘此極雙管齊下的攻勢，似乎現已以安慶的攻擊為起點。因而安慶的得失，不僅關係北岸所有橋頭堡陣地的存亡得失，並且關係和談可能談判時的條件商討者甚大。為了確保眞正和平的獲致，我們一方面希望共軍在和談進行中，勿以軍事攻勞壓境，另方面希望政府記取歷史經騐敎訓，要在爭取和平的努力，不可輕易放棄了安慶！</p>
<p>要之，安慶的放棄，長江水上交通將有斷絕之虞，甚而首都失全的威脅亦可立至。這情勢是不堪設想的！因此，在今天穩定安慶與謀取和平，有同樣的重要價值。我們對於李代總統致力和平的準備，以及何內閣成立以後致力江防的準備，同樣認為不可缺一的車之兩輸，而他們能否密切配合以達成其任務，則安慶的保衛戰應該可以作一測騐。</p>
<h3>行駛港穗綫「和平輪」觸水雷爆炸沉沒　搭審五百餘人生還者不及半數</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿五日電〕行駛穗港綫之和平輪（原名利航）外電稱「東方小姐號」頃又繼石門輸後在珠江內河觸雷，緣該輪於廿四日下午九時由穗開港，十時許駛經滬　河面，突然觸雷，在船身左邊爆炸，全船卽告傾側，當時搭客共五百餘人，現生還者僅二二五人，其餘均炸斃或失蹤，有八名傷者則已運返本市救治。此間航政局，海員公會及有關機關均派員前赴施救中。又該輪屬英商，最近始航行港穗綫，載重約千餘噸，船上有舞廳，素以華麗見稱。</p>
<p>〔路透社香港廿五日電〕往來香港廣州閒之汽輪「東方小姐號」昨夜在距離廣州六哩處觸雷，水雷想係土匪所置，因最折數月，輪船曾迭接恐嚇信索取「保護費」。</p>
<h3>監委曹宣在監院報告　重慶艦出走原因　主要為海軍派系之摩擦</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕赴滬調查重慶艦出走案之監委曹德宣，盧鳳開兩氏，廿五日晨自滬返京，廿五日上午監院大會中，曹氏並曾報告調查經過。據曹氏稱：重慶號之出走，最重要之原因，為海軍派系摩擦。原艦長鄧兆祥為馬尾系，而新易之艦長盧東閣，則屬於靑島系，易艦長之命令發表，遂激起鄧兆祥及艦上馬尾系官兵之不滿，因而氣憤出走，旣非由於待遇之太差亦非由於共產黨之陰謀煽動。蓋據桂總司令及趙參謀長所告，重慶艦官兵之待遇，向較他艦為優，同時事先亦並無任何不陷之現象也。惟重慶號之出走，可能係鄧兆祥之臨時預謀。上月廿一日海總在滬開會，鄧卽命非馬尾系之副艦長前往參加，並命其他四十餘非馬尾系之船員上岸。及廿一日新艦長之任命發表，重慶號即於廿二日以試航為藉口出走，當日開出十七海視，旋復折回。根據此項材料判斷，卽可知重慶號係有意出走，因如試航，只須開出十三海涅，且其折回，亦係因大霧之故也。重慶號出走以後，直至烟合，並無共軍上船，至葫蘆島時，始有共軍二百餘人登般，並調換原艦上之砲手。空軍轟炸時之所以未迴遇猛烈抵抗，卽以此故。曹氏報告畢，曾有若干委員發言，認桂不能辭其咎，但亦有部分委員，認為戀再詳細調查，並主對於糾舉桂永淸案，應經眞重考慮。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕監委曹德宜在監院議席上報告調查重慶艦事件時稱：外傳艦上存有鉅額金銀，並非事實，艘上僅有官兵福利金銀元卅萬枚。曹委員並透露海軍體隻出走者，除重慶號外，尚有黃安·長白艦及二〇一號登陸艇。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕立委李雅仙等所提為重慶艦出走事，請國防部長徐永昌，參謀總長顧祝同，海軍總司令桂永清，列席說明原因及責任，並查究失踪之第十三綏靖區司令官王凌雲案。廿五日晨復提山立院院會，當以新任行政院長已三十日上午列席院會作施政報告，是日下午可請軍事當局列席報告，屆時再提出質詢，會衆無異議通過。</p>

<h3>美對華政策聲明　杜魯門不欲發表　衆議員海爾斥美對華緘默政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕社魯門總統廿四日告記者招待會稱，渠不以為應發表對華政策聲明，故在最近將來，將無對華政策之聲明。總統回答詢問在最近將來發表對華政策聲明之可能性時，作此項談話。渠之回答與國務院不發表美對華政策聲明之政策似相符合。同時，共和黨衆議員海爾前在衆院演說時，曾痛斥美國對華之緘默政策。渠之演詞副稿由郵局在華盛頓傳佈。海爾稱，「當國務卿不得不以秘密會議討論吾人對華政策時，顯然定有不對之處。如吾人對華政策為淸楚而有理智者，則吾人在信中向總統所提之問題應公開並淸晰地予以答覆」，海函構，「國務院不只是失敗，在使共黨進展無阻方面已成功。吾人正如政府之行政部門相同，應負責中國之安全與光榮」。</p>

<h3>開放西江航行權　何內閣將予糾正</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕據權威方面息：前政院規定梧州為對外通商口岸，開敖西江內河航行權事，何內閣成立後卽將查明後加以糾正。據政府某負責人員解釋，梧州開放為對外通商口岸與重慶及漢口相同，可以設關結匯，但並非開放西江之內河航行權，過去誤會西江可以外輸自由通航，今後將經由外交途徑加以糾正</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕最近行政院規定梧州為對外通商口岸，開放西江內河航行權。認者訪晤一向努力維護航權之立委李雲良及叩詢意見，李氏談稱西江為我國之錦繍內河，在經濟及國防上之重要性不亞於長江，自前清光緒二十八年中英訂立馬凱條約，經由英人主特之海關頒行西江通商章程，開放省城，江門，三水，梧州四處為通商口岸，白土口等六處為暫停口岸，馬寗等十處為旅客上下處所，西江之內河航行權遂告喪失，而成為英籍輪船之勢力範圍，歷半世紀之久，直至抗戰勝利英美等國始放棄在華所享之各種特權，其中最主要之一項卽內河及沿海航行權。例如中英新約卽規定（一）英王陛下效棄關於在中國「通商口岸」制度下之一切現行條約櫂利。（二）放棄給予其船舶在中國領水內關於沿海貿易及內河航行之特權。喪失多年之航權於焉收回‘西江內河航行權亦震回祖國懷抱，四年來兩粵航業界努力經營之成果，已有國籍輪船大小共八百五十四艘計五萬六千六百十五噸定期行駛於珠江域，自香港廣州以至梧州一帶貨客運輪極為便利，目前噸位已供過於求，常不足半載，無論就主權或事實而論，收回不久之內河胞行權斷無重行開放之理。</p>

<h3>首批離華北外僑稱　天津成商業鬼城　照目前情形發展下去將淪為村莊</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城廿四日電〕據第一批准允離開中共所控制華北區之外僑廿四日告合衆社稱：天津已成一座商業「鬼城」，外僑十六人及華人十四人，於二天前乘「漢陽輪」自天津抵達南韓。據外僑稱：在天津之外僑皆未受到共黨之侵擾，包括白俄在內，外僑在城內之行動並未受有限制。</p>
<p>旅客引述共方官員之言稱：彼等希望對外貿易，並希望中外所有商業再度蓬勃繁榮，藍天津之商業現完全停滯中，天津若干外僑僉信，若共黨能夠使天津恢復繁榮，不依靠外援保持對外貿易時，共黨將排擠洋商。另一旅客稱：共產鐵官員迄未與外國領事館接觸，彼等僉信共產黨在實行「你們政府不承認我，我亦不承認你」的政策。</p>
<p>另一旅客表示：共產黨現仍在「黑暗中摸索」。共方顯然缺乏國外貿易，銀行，市政管理及經營港口設備等基本原則之學識。渠認為共產黨的確地在努力使天律繁榮，但照目下情形下去，天津將變成一「村莊」。共黨領袖亦自承管理城市失敗，共黨雖未與任何外國領事有所接觸，但曾與各外商洽商，仝時，天津各外商曾聯合致面中共華北政府主席董必武，陳述有關天津商業蕭條之情形。</p>

<h3>蘇聯國防部長易人　布加寗免職仍留任副總理　伐西萊夫斯基繼長國防部</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫數廿四日電〕莫斯科電台廿四日廣播稱：國防部長布加蜜元帥已免職，遺缺由副部長伐西萊夫斯基繼任。該廣播指出布加寗仍留任部長會議副主席之職。布氏之免去國防部長與莫洛托夫及米高揚被免去外長及對外貿易部長如同一轍。彼等三人被免去經常行政職責後，諒將致力於較高級之政治策略，蓋上述三人仍為政治局委員。</p>
<p>莫斯科電台宜布此項消息前廣播稱，靑年共黨聯合會之全國大會即將召開。參加該會之代表名單，首為政治局十二個委負，包括史達林·米高揚·莫洛托夫及布加寗等，惟加一政治局委員伏茲尼森斯基在該名單上獨付闕如。按伏茲尼森斯基於三月十四日免去部長會議副主席兼國家設計委員會主席之職。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕蘇聯地上部隊領導權的轉移，使官方對最近蘇聯政治上的更迭，更加上一重神秘。權成人土對此種更迭，是否表示蘇聯領袖的升遷，抑包含若干「淸算」的因素在內，仍感眩惑。此間最主要之觀感為蘇聯正使其高級政洽局委員，將更多的時間致力於蘇聯內部問題，同時對外交則稍予忽視，此舉或表示蘇聯可能決定停止進一步擴展，而在鐵慕致力於穩固其職後的收穫。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社〕布加寗生於八九五年，在二次世界大職前渠係雷機工廠之總經理，隨後任國家銀行之行長。在大戰期間，渠被任命為朱柯夫元帥之政治委員。渠隨後出任莫斯科副市長。人民委員會副主席，隨後又担任民族議會主席。一九四四年十二月繼伏羅希洛夫任國防委員會副主席。在布加寗被任命為共黨組織局之委員後，一九四六年三月又被任命為最高條維挨之第一副主席及聯鄰議會之副主席，同年並晉升元帥級。</p>
<p>繼布加寗任國防部長之伐西萊夫斯基，今年四十七歲。渠為貧農之子。渠在革命前不久，剛滿十八歲時，卽加入軍隊。一九四〇年渠巳晉級至中將，一九四三年一月晉級上將，下一月卽晉級元帥。卽在此時，代替查彼奇尼柯夫為紅軍參謀總長。在渠就任後，渠指揮對德軍發動大反攻，將德軍自頓訶驅逐至蘇聯國境以外。一九四四年渠率領蘇聯代表團赴英。一九四七年五月五日渠被任命為國防部第一副部長。</p>

<h3>市警局全力偵查碎屍案　懸賞黃金五條緝凶　要證菜園長工言詞閃爍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕謹記路無頭案碎屍案發生後，昨為第五日，案情日有進展，緊張萬分。警局自毛局長以下全體對該案異常注意，為求迅速破案，集中全部精力，分頭偵查，堅信定可迅加破獲。昨深夜記者獲知：警局已懸賞金條五根，徵求通風報信因而破案者，並公告，如凶手能卽日投局自首，可予減刑一半。再據警局負責人對記者表示：該案兩日來已獲一極有價值之新綫索，惟為便利偵查，暫時將禁止任何人對外透露。</p>
<p>綜計五日來各方偵查結果，在有關之「人」與「物」兩方面，已出現五項重要綫索。</p>
<p>首言人證：最初發現碎屍之李長安（見圖、本報攝），在其口中尙有無數資料可資發掘。據記者調查：李係齊魯別墅所雇之菜園長工，渠每日之固定工作為灌溉菜蔬，看守菜蔬。在別墅側有一小屋（距騎士處約五十公尺），渠經常食宿其中，因最近常有人竊菜，渠每夜必起身數次，往菜畦附近巡視。按謹記路為通龍華機場及龍華兵營必經之路，故軍車來往澈夜不停，但宵禁時間內則決無人跡。警局現已根據極可靠之證據，證明棄屍工作係廿一日黎明前（亦卽宵禁時間內）所做，則在李長安警覺有人竊菜之心理下，一聞足步聲，自無不起身加以察看之理，惟渠言詞閃爍，堅稱絕無所聞見。</p>
<p>其次為謹記路上舖修路面之工人。據齊魯別墅門房「老王」稱，渠曾聞彼等談及十九日見過三輪車載客携包裏向出事地點方向走去。經記者調查：該批工人為工務局第二區第八工務段所屬，在謹記路上工作已達兩週，工段主任為陳紹龍。記者昨晚復曾向渠等追詢，渠等否認曾談過此事，並謂該工段工作時間係自上午七時半至下午五時。此中情形，似頗有深入偵查比必要。</p>
<p>尙有一度在浦江渡輪上被人發現之丟包婦人，值得偵訪，因目前死者之頭顱，手指，足趾，內臟等仍無蹤跡，若知悉該婦人之住址進而獲悉當日包內果屬何物，則此案不難立轉明朗。</p>
<p>證物</p>
<p>方面言：除昨日本報發現日曆上之格言，足以約略測得凶手犯罪動機及日程外，包裏屍體之油布及旅行包亦係重要資料。該物質地因不能留下指紋，故僅可憑其外面有無附着泥土以覘其携來時之路由。前年青滬路上却利謀殺余盛孝案之破獲，卽賴當時汽車上少數泥土判定出事地點。據警局初步檢騐結果謂並無泥土，但此事值得再加詳密騐查。</p>
<p>記者昨復曾分訪接壤當熟分局之龍華，徐家匯等分局，渠等對該案有另一看法：卽北站箱屍案與碎屍案發生日期相隔僅三週，包裹內同樣有婦女衣物，兩死者迄今又俱無家屬出面，凡此皆可視為前後兩案不無關聯，或竟係某一組織有計劃之行動，或係箱屍案發生後凶手中因分臟，衝突等關係對同伴再下毒手，致有此碎屍案之出現。渠等更認為該案發生於本市市區內之可能性極大。同時因發現地點在南郊，屍體支解洗淨工作之澈底，凶手動手場所尤可能在西南區各大建築物中。渠等建議，目前可與法商水電公司合作，進行調查各大公寓近來之用水量。因洗淨屍體及冲沉內臟需水必多，如某處某日用水量特別超越其常年平均用量過鉅，則再檢查其污水管及附近陰溝，必獲驚人發見。</p>
<p>至於碎屍全部重量，昨經警局再度詳核，計重九十七磅。包裹內之婦女頭髮一根，亦予妥密保存。惟為積極追覓死者頭顱及內臟等起見，警局已決於今日起出動大批訓練有素之警犬，分驅各地找尋，期能藉此再獲一重要綫索。</p>
<h3>地檢處檢騐碎屍論普善山莊領埋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕謹記路碎屍案發現後之次日，地檢處檢察官汪優峯，偕法醫鄭廷聘，率同檢騐員邵國俊等，前往同仁輔元堂檢騐，當諭知普善山莊領埋。昨日該處發表檢騐報告書稱：該屍體缺少頭，頸，内臟（因肚腹被挖去，僅留小臟及半個腰子），兩乳頭扁平，微顯褐色，生殖器被割，根部留有陰毛，軀幹分成上中下三段，下肢戳成數段塊，大腿甚肥大，全身共截為三十二塊，各肌肉無血液粘着，係被謀死後文解。至其致死原因，因頭，頸，內臟缺如僅餘肌肉，無法證明。</p>
<h3>火車箱屍案杭州無眉目</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿五日電〕火車箱屍案，警務處呈請浙省會警局偵查，本報記者昨與局長周康暢談此項偵查情形，周氏對兩路提供之杭一市民函件內云在湧金檸下發現人藏一箱，謂已調查不確，又赴湧金門附近偵查，均稱無其人。</p>
<h3>女襖袖裏紙條發現來歷經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕碎屍案中最引人深思之證物，為装盛屍塊包裹中女襖袖裏之紙條，揆其文字語意，頗似格言，可能為案中重要綫索之一。故本報記者曾就「古今中外格言集成」六百多頁中遍索亦無此類語句。此外並詳查印有格言之日記本及各種日曆亦無所獲。迨至廿四日午夜，突在本館日曆內發现十月廿一日以頁下端，載有格言一則，全文為，人之有仇於我可忘而不可念」，較之碎屍案中之紙條，僅多一「而」字。急取是項未用過之日曆逐頁檢視，赫然發現二月十一日之日曆上，卽有「人之有仇於我可忘不可念」十一字之格言，與案中紙條完全相同。嗣又查明該項日曆為華新日曆廠所出。</p>
<p>昨日記者卽往訪華新日曆廠，向該廠編輯此項日曆格言之人員探詢，據稱，類此格言共有四語，其排列之順序，首為「人之有恩於我可念不可忘」，次為「人之有仇於我可忘不可念」，再次為「人之謗我也能辯不如能容」，末為「人之侮我也能防不如能化」。至編排日期為二月十日至十三日及十月廿日至廿三日，關於十月廿一日多一「而」字一點，據解釋實係無意出此，惟此四句格言以往從未採用，尙為本年度所列入者。至格言之出處及來源，則未能道其詳。但據記者查考古籍中與此語意相近者，為戰國策唐且語信陵君：「事有不可忘者，有不可不忘者，人之有德於我也，不可忘也，吾有德於人也，不可不忘也」。</p>
<p>按華新日曆本年共有十種大小，橫豎不一，且均印有格言，惟僅在排列時，空隙稍有不同，本案中所發現之紙條，昨經常熟分局承辦警員逐一與該廠出品二月十一日日曆核對結果，適與本報昨日刊出者相同，誠可謂巧合。</p>
<h3>常州古墓似曾被盜　專家探訪歸來談話　認為仍有發掘價值</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市博物館館長楊寬暨藝術科主任蔣大沂，日前赴常州查訪南門外發現之古墓，昨已事畢返滬。據渠等觀察，該古基可能早已被人盜過，因當初城防部隊發現該墓時，係就泥土最厚　處挖掘戰壕，始則發現一洞，繼續下掘，乃露出第一室之墻壁，但並無墓頂。由此種跡象推測，該墓什九早經盜過矣。惟盗墓者之目的在於金銀寶物，而考古之目的則在求其女獻，故該墓卽使已被盜過，仍有發掘研究的價值。該墓所在地之高邱，雖佔地七八畝之廣，但就已發現的墓室大小來觀察，該墓決無七八畝之大。高邱之下可能有幾個古墓，亦可能僅邊緣上有目前所發現的一個墓而已。在古時厚葬風俗之下，普通人死後的墳墓均有重門疊戶，故該墓大抵並非帝王公侯之墓。至其年代仍以三國孫權時為最可能。現所發現之墓磚上古錢圖案，除「五」字較為清晰端正外，其餘三字之形狀為前所未見者。但細加觀察，可看出與「大」「泉」「百」四字有近似之處，可能係當時匠人臨摹時信筆變化所致。磚上花紋雖有三種，但無論如何，其最早朝代不越東漢之末，最遲止於西晋。該墓發掘工作現尙未繼續進行，楊蔣兩氏此次赴常，曾就發掘方法貢獻意見，俾可於進行時不致損毁而保存文獻價值云。</p>
<h3>議長參議員踵府懇留市長流淚力言不得已　非為畏難實因病體難以支持</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市參議會以吳市長任職三年來，精心　劃，勞績卓著，近以健康關係提出辭職，而當此時局動盪之際，正賴賢者繼續努力，昨特在該會舉行茶會商討挽留。會後，潘議長暨參議員四十四人，齊赴市政府謁見吳市長，面致懇切挽留之至意。當由吳市長在市府會議室接見，首由潘議長代表參議會致慰留之意，望市長能為全市六百萬市民着想，打消辭意。吳市長當表示此番因體力不支而堅請辭職，實出於萬不得已，對參議會同人之高誼盛情，愧感交倂，但望能獲得諒解云云。吳市長昨因參議員羣趨懇留，深受感動，致情緒極度不安，且因一時感情衝動，竟至熱淚盈眶，當塲黯然淚下。渠稱：人都是情感的動物，三年來承各參議員惠予協助，使本市危難局面得以維持。際此臨走前夕，不勝依依之感。今天在各位面前實覺難以說話，因為本人至今已經不得不走。</p>
<p>三大問題解決後來者不困難</p>
<p>唯須聲明者，本人絕非困難而退，相反的，本市已有三大問題獲得結果，可使後來者不致為難，比乃：（一）經濟問題——美援米之供應，可延長至六月底為止，早經宣佈在前，現經本人力爭後，其他經濟部份如棉花麺粉、石油、肥料等，均可延長至六月底為止，是則已予工商業以相當維護，本市之經濟暫時可告無處。（二）軍隊紀律問題——目下土兵待遇業經提高，副食費亦已有辦法，則郊區市民負担可望減輕，本市治安已可確保。（三）市府收支問題——下月份乃附加税之旺月；至提高市府公敎人員之待遇問題，現每人每月已增加食米二斗，且水電津貼亦予設法繼續，務求其最低生活可以維持。觀此種種，本人決非一走了事，致對市民無法交待。且二個月來本人病體確實難以支持，尤以近數日為甚，幾乎每晨發作，致影響工作精神。至於暂時請假絕非澈底解決辦法，因本人辦事素具責任心，非完全擺脫不可，且代理者辦事亦極困難。故經考慮再三，決定堅辭。對各位好意，銘感五中，無法接受，只得把眼淚往肚子裏吞云云。吳市長言畢，參議員王先青，姜懷素相機起立發言，再予挽留，謂際此局勢緊張之時，市民不能放吳市長離滬，決電請行政院下令不准辭職。</p>
<p>市長淚痕滿面咽哽不能成聲</p>
<p>市長聞言後，當決左右為難，無法應付，神情頗為緊張，以斷續之語調稱：我的話已經說完，身體不行，不能勉强。力疾從公不是毀滅自己，便是耽誤公事……市長言至此，竟已淚痕縱橫，咽哽不能成聲。其時全塲默然無聲。當由潘議長發言稱：市長病體日壞，乃屬事實，上海需要吳氏亦屬事實，為公私兼顧計，可卽請病假俾資休養，一面電中央挽留，並請市長自今日起勿再提辭呈。今日為時已甚晚，至此卽可告一段落。散後，記者當詢吳市長，參議會同人如此至誠相挽，市長辭意是否可告打消？吳氏搖頭答稱：仍將堅辭，因身體不許可也。</p>
<p>茶會上一致通過電政院挽留市長</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參會茶會於昨日下午三時四十分，假該會大禮堂舉行，到潘議長，徐副議長，及參議員五十六人。由潘議長主席，首先闡明茶會目的，在商討如何挽留市長。吳市長在上海政績斐然，遽爾請辭，各界無不懇切挽留。本人曾屢請其打消辭意，然迄未經渠接受。上海目前情勢日緊一日，決不容市長雖辭，望參會同人發揮力量，懇請慰留云云。繼由徐副議長，參議員唐世昌、金潤庠、姜懷素、陳保泰、費樹聲、虞舜、趙仰雄、瞿銊、王延松、朱文德等相繼致詞，大多對市長表示慰留之意，並議決由參議會請行政院挽留，並於會後同赴市府親見吳市長，面致懇切慰留之意。</p>
<p>潘議長（左）等赴市府挽留吳市長，市長（右）痛哭流涕，表明態度時神情。（本報攝）</p>
<h3>對美僑民眷屬返滬美總領館發表聲明　認為猶難斷言緊急狀態已成過去</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處本市廿五日訊〕關於已撤退之美人眷屬返歸上海一事，美總領事館本日發表聲明如下：</p>
<p>關於美國人眷屬返歸上海一事，總領事館曾接到許多詢問，要求闡明態度，此等詢問，一部份係由於已有少數眷屬返歸上海之故而提出者。</p>
<p>目下之局勢雖暫入平靜狀態，惟總領事館認為欲言緊急狀態確已過去，猶嫌過早。十一月間發出撤退警告之基本原因，仍未改變。吾人固望上海能避免中國許多地區在悲慘衝突中所遭遇之意外，惟此點猶難斷言。不論和談之結果如何，上海方面之美國人在未來數月中可能面臨種種意外與困難。在現行情形下，自附近安全地區，暂時前來上海，可能不致有意外危險。惟欲言眷屬——尤其是兒童——能安全返歸此一地區，猶嫌過早。因迫切理由而仍留此間之美國人之地位，可能因眷屬之返歸此間而更形困難。</p>
<p>總領事館深信美國人在使其眷屬返歸之前，對上述各點將予以審慎之考慮。有關眷屬返歸之事，其決定責任猶如原光之撤退工作然，仍須屬儲有關之個人與家庭。俟局勢成為相當明顯可以准許眷屬之時，總領事館將發表更明確之聲明。有關眷屬返歸事宜之詢問，均已按照上述意見予以答覆。</p>

<h3>租房標準重加審查　參事室所訂方案市政會議未通過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市房租標準問題，經參事室研究後，昨經再度提出市政會議討論，惟仍未獲通過。據悉：參事室所訂之標準，仍以地政局擬具之三項辦法為根據，並將本市房屋分成六種等級，而房租標準之高低，卽與房屋建築之優劣成正比，原則上房租仍按生活指數倍數調整，底數按照戰前租金酌打折扣。而其折扣之大小，與原租額成反比。例如戰前租金為一百元者，以原額之百分之二十五乘當期生活指數，卽為現時應付之租金。而戰前租金較一百元低者，則以原額之百分之二十乘當期生活指數。上項辦法，經昨日市政會議提出討論後，認為如經實施，將來房東及房客間之糾紛必多。因房屋好壞，雖有一定標準，而房東房客協議不成時，必將請由地政局協調，如是地政局將不勝其煩矣。故認為有重加審查之必要，昨日仍未商定具體結果。據市府參事室消息：房租標準，攸關全滬市民，市府必將訂定公正合理辦法，並於最近數天中卽可議決並公佈之。</p>

<h3>港商心目中的華北貿易　載去的是希望帶回的是失望</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港廿二日航訊〕第一艘從華北共區開返的船隻，昨已返抵香港，這兩三週來，一艘又一艘的船隻載了貨物，也載了港商無限的希望，駛往華北·就在這個期間，中共頒佈最對外貿易用管理暫行辦法，「在商言商」的港商，對此更感興奮。但是希望越大而失望越大，昨天「商華利」貨輸所帶回的「」事實，却使港商搭然若失。大家對這一方面的生意，不禁頓轉悲觀而滿懷感慨了！</p>
<p>高華利輪載往天津的貨物，計有糖精十箱，約一千磅，樹膠一百噸，硫化元青二百担，以港方行情計算，港商滿以爲儘可換得花生三千件回來，但結果祇換得花生一百件，其他山貨（包括合桃，杏仕，栗子，瓜京等京菓類）和藥材七百多件，真是迎面澆來一盤冷水，而大賠老本猶其餘事。</p>
<p>港商到了現在，才恍然大悟以「保護工商政策」爲標榜的中共，原來他們那一套手法，似比政府過去的留易管制還厲害！中共把一般商人所「夢寐求之」的貨物，不是列爲專賣如（花生，大豆，豬鬃，油類和煤炭）就是禁止出口，（如糧食，豆餅，生麵等），而准許他們自由交換的，只有銷路狹窄的山貨和藥材。港商運去的東西，僅有軍用品和機器獲得歡迎，至於工業原料，紗布，糧食等，雖可輸入，但受歧視，交換不到有價值的東西。港商開始看到中共「貿易局」的威權了。</p>
<p>據說，中共征收的入口稅，與政府過去的稅率相同。出口的山貨和藥材，則征稅百分之五。爲了繳稅和申請物物交換，貨物出入都　要經過兩次估價。一次是海關，一次是貿易局，兩次估價互有出入，且與當地貨價不同。港商對中共估價人員的「缺稼經騐和能力」，都　留下權深刻的印象而表示大大的失望。高華利輪帶回來「寳貴的教訓」，已使港商對中共的政策最後發生懷升級版，而對中共的真面目也有了一個新認識。</p>
<p>港府昨天公佈二月份對華的留易數字，計進口值三四·〇〇八·一三二港元，其中華南佔二三·三三〇，四三五元，華北佔八·二八四，二一四元，華中佔二·三九三，四八三元，出口值二三·〇二九·二七一元，其中華南佔一一·七七八·九四一元，華北佔七·九一五·二六九元，華中佔三·三三五·〇六一元。（在港府的眼裏，中國祇有一個政府，沒有國民黨與共黨政府之分，華北爲中國一部份，所以現在香港和華北貿易仍屬對華貿易，而不當作對共區貿易的）由此可見，就在二月份，華北對香港的貿易計達一千六百萬元以上，比華中尤多。這些數字洩露了一個大秘密：除港商外，中共或與中共有關的也在香港大做特做對華北的生意。他們僱了專輪，一批一批把急需的物資運往華北，也一批一批把華北的原料運來香港，一個商人氣憤憤的說：「我而今可懂得中共的經濟政策了，賺錢的生意祇好由他們去做，厚利的貨物只好由他們去專賣。他們祇知道有貿易局而不知道有商人，國民黨過去的政策也沒有這樣自私而兒裁啊！」</p>
<p>據汽車商人表示：現在香港市塲上，卡車已告雞雞市，不論新的舊的，都給中共有關人士搜購凈盡，連帶關係，汽車零件，輪胎和汽油也斷檔，洋紙運往華北，最近也有飛躍進展。據有關方面稱，本月份運往華北的，僅登陸書紙一項，已有五百噸，如包括書紙一項，已有五百噸，如包括捲筒紙，拷貝紙，鷄皮紙等，總至少在一千噸以上。就事實上的需要，今後臨江對華北的貿易當將續有增加，但「在商言商」，商人們對此只好「改弦易轍」或另眼相看」了。</p>

<h3>到底是否世界最高峯？　積石山再受考驗　美探險家克拉克等由陸路前往探測</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州十七日航訊〕積石山（阿尼瑪卿）是否世界最高峯之謎，自上年央航副理陳文寬駕駛專機前往探沒後，已證明是騙子雷諾的一片謊言，後來事過境遷，積石山在人的腦子裏，已漸漸被時間沖淡了。最近又有人舊事重提：一個美籍探險　家名叫克拉克的，上北平經包頭，寗夏來蘭，同行的還有一個輔仕大學教授。他們抵蘭後，卽訪問國立科學教育館盧館長壽枬，表示對積石山很感興趣，要由陸路前往一遊；因爲他在一本美國雜誌上，讀到一篇雷諾所寫關於積石山的報道，上面描寫積石山仍舊是世界第一高峯。這次旅行西北，特別要到積石山去探測它的高度，以明究竟，並欣賞冰雪中積石山的風光。克拉克又極喜打獵，他希望能在積石山狩獵到珍奇的鳥獸。他們商得青海省當局的同意後，卽刻出發，兩三個月後仍要回到蘭州來。</p>
<p>流亡到蘭州談古城北平</p>
<p>自北平和談成功後，化裝逃出來的公血人員和大學生很多，他們大都　經包頭·寗夏或陜西北來。張家口市長王德厚和他的參事高玉田，北平自衛總隊少將副總隊長高金蘭及董泊生，另外還有十幾個大學生，都先後到了蘭州。據他們說，他們這次從北平搭火車到張家口，乘汽車到平地泉，再從火車到卓資山，這是一個真空地帶，中共每站都盤查得很嚴，因爲他們北裝成正當商民，還携有妥當的證件，所以一路都未遭留難。從卓資山步行到綏遠後，搭火車到包頭，然後往寗夏到這裏。聽說逃出來的燕大，北大以及師大學生絡繹於途及滯留寗夏的還很多。他們談起北平的近況說，共軍進入北平，秩序總未能恢復，經濟金融尤覺得混亂。人民票，地方流通券和許多小票同時行使，通貨也顯得異常膨脹。共軍曾登記人民的財產。傳作義的若干幹部，有的已自殺，如卅五軍郭軍長，有的已化裝逃出，如暫編第三軍安軍長春山。高金蘭隊長說他曾看到吳裕後的所謂南京人民和平代表團。「解放」後的故都新聞界，中共有約法三章：（一）要多登新華社的消息。（二）不正確的消息不准登載。（三）稿件要經過核准才許登。以後的各報，已很少「本報訊」，變成清一色的「新華社訊」了。一個師大學生李燕俠笑着說：「北平的笑話很多，中共軍隊進入北平後，都市的過度豪華，真使共軍像」「劉佬佬進大觀園」似的，有「受寵若驚」之感了。</p>
<p>空衛爾六架由美將抵蘭</p>
<p>據中央航空公司蘭州辦事處主任趙文彬談，該公司在美訂製的「空衛爾」新型客機六架，已自美經歐洲飛流，日內卽可抵達。「空衛爾」又名「空中皇宮號」，最宜長途飛行，如普通客機由滬飛迪化，往返需時四天，若以「空衛爾」型機飛行，一日即可抵迪，故該型機將來加入此一國內最長航綫之可能性甚大。「空衛爾」型機可搭客四十人，有八個特點：（一）機艙內裝有自動氣溫調節器，不受寒暑之苦。（二）飛行速率每小時三百哩，較目前任何客機爲快。（三）引擎馬力特強，起落自如。（四）機內有氣壓調節器，乘客不感暈旋·疲倦等不快。（五）機冀內裝有發熱設備，冰雪在機冀上即刻溶解，無結冰之真。（六）瞭望孔頗大，乘客可賞心悅目。（八）油箱加迪簡捷，機艙內有雙重保險，安全設備齊全。</p>

<p>甘肅省政府去看十月間，令饚各縣市局，開始調查人民財富，其最高標準「特等富戶」的不動產或動產是五萬銀幣，已快半年了，各縣受到很多的阻碍。截至最近止，呈報到省的只有夏河·肅北·卓尼·會川·和政等幾個縣局，其他六十多縣，還是查元信息。據報的幾縣局，夏河縣有四五戶，肅北和卓尼兩設治局只有兩三戶，會川偌大一個縣，連够得上戊等標準（有動產或不動產一萬銀幣）的富戶都沒有·這種報告，無論任何人都不會相信，　可是會川縣參議會甚至函省府加以證實。所以省府昨天又令知該縣，不得藉詞推諉，要切實澈底調查。這些事實證明了革新運動的前途，確是有點困難。</p>

<h3>桂參議會堅決擁護開放梧州</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　梁雨山</p>
<p>〔本報桂林十七日航訊〕梧州口岸是廣西第一生命綫，桂省一致籲請政府立卽實行開放，理由是：（一）交通方面，穗梧航綫四一八公里，港梧航綫四三二公里，以前梧州設海關時，經此出口直達港澳，行程僅兩三天，後梧關改組，出口貨須繞道廣州·江門等地輸出，行程延至一星期，貨運增加，成本加重，商賈裏足，貨不能暢其流。（二）金融方面，梧州開放後，在結匯方面有不少便宜，因爲梧州不開放，中央銀行在此不設置辦理外匯機構，凡由梧州輸出入的結匯事宜，指定其他銀行代辦，再轉到上海央行收賬，出口商因爲港匯人見值的不同和調款匯費及時日的損失，無形中增加負担。（三）外匯損失，廣東河道縱橫，容易走私，由梧州江的物資轉口到粵境，未必能够按照規定結匯，對國家外匯損失極大，梧州出口貨數字頗鉅，如果規定凡由梧州輸出的外銷物資，必須在此結匯輸出，因家收入可望增加。</p>
<p>桂省參議會現力主從速恢復梧州海關，該會第廿三次駐委會就此問題研討，亦認爲開放梧州爲對外口岸，桂·黔·滇等地土產及港·澳外貨能直接自梧州進出，於國計民生裨益甚大。現不平等條約，早經取銷，開稅自主，實非遜清被迫訂約開放通商口岸可比。內河航權，國家主權所在，政府自能慎重考慮，故認爲梧州開放對外貿易，實可便利商民，繁榮內地經濟，促進生產，與廣州·漢口等地設關之意義一致。</p>
<p>梧州開放以後，轉口稅和轉運費減省，輸出方面，因成本減輕，可以增加土產外銷數量，對繁榮商業發展經濟自屬有利。輸入方面，因成本減低，無形中增強消費者的購買力。不過，因爲這一來，內地的手工業和航業跟着也就會有問題，如何增加生產，穩定經濟，控制航權，實在還值得研究。</p>

<h3>新財長劉攻芸答記者問　財金改革在議擬中　昨晚招待金融界謂係普通酬酢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新任財政部部長劉攻芸，昨日在京公畢，來於下午四時半乘機飛返滬，劉氏於五時許，卽　車起點央銀行辦公。劉氏深恐記者羣擬集體訪問，先透過該行新聞聯絡委員會，向外界宣稱：渠雖已由何內閣發表擔任財長一職，惟迄未正式就職。故一切以財長地位發表之談話，須俟就職後方能公布。</p>
<p>惟記者羣仍提書面問題多則，送請劉氏作答，茲探誌劉氏有答覆之各項問答如次：（一）財金改革新方案，是否尚有新補充辦法？答：現正議擬中。（二）現行幣制是否有新改革，外傳將發銀元券之說確否？對問題前半截未有答覆，惟稱發行銀元券之說，絕對不確。（三）現有之輸管政策，是否將有修改？答：正與經濟部商討中。（四）鈔荒何時方可切實解決，有無具體解決辦法？答：現正設法逐步改善中。（五）銀元是否將在金業市塲拋售？答：運用銀元，隨時斟酌辦理。</p>
<p>其他關於白銀貸款，財部政次常次，國行副總裁之新人選，財部對南北通匯之態度等問題，劉氏並未作任何答覆。</p>
<p>又劉氏於昨晚七時，假中行四樓邀宴本市金融界各領袖人士，劉氏昨雖對記者聲稱，該項邀宴，不過係屬普通之酬酢而已。然衆信劉氏就任財長後，必將針對當前財金改革新方案實施後之各種現實問題，另有一套更機動更切實收效的新辦法，以補老案之不足。觀乎劉氏昨日答覆記者之第一個問題，卽足證劉氏不但有決心另擬補充辦法，且現已在議擬中。惟劉氏初任財長，爲表示集思廣益起見，特再聽取本市金融界各領袖之意見，以爭取財金各界之合作，而利新補充辦法之推行。</p>
<h3>國行昨未售黃金市況俏利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕黃金昨日前市走勢平穩，後市激升。晨初因銀根尚濫，更傳聞國行連續大量拋壓後，昨日已有暫停之意。而隔夜行局又鉅額差出，業中預料認爲暫時未能抽緊，故趨勢呈堅，　面吸意亦濃。晨開在人心堅俏聲中，初喊六〇五萬買進，但賣出無人響應，未有成交。瞬息喊高至六一二萬，始有成交。大戶逢高吐售，市勢稍平，低至六一一萬。但業外游資不斷侵襲，塲外走勢已較塲內喊高，因之執戶高扳，納者尤衆，市勢直升至六一九萬。中間一路盤堅，走勢未見疲色。至十一時許，恐國行再施壓力，浮多心理趨軟，空方活躍，塲內塲外脫意濃厚，行情步小，低見六一二萬與六一三萬。嗣後未見拋售，人心轉穩，而新空補納，喊價乃又回升，終以六一四五〇〇〇元收市。</p>
<p>午後承前市俏勢，銀根鬆濫如故，大戶暗中吸收，市勢再見俏升。初開六一八萬，一路昂升至六二五萬，晚收。塲外前市午收爲六一二萬，六一五萬，後市晚收爲六一八萬，六二一萬。又當日頭寸隔日交割，加息二九萬元</p>
<p>美銷鈔晨開一二七〇〇元，一二八〇〇元，收一二三〇〇元，一二四〇〇元。午後開一二四〇〇元，一二五〇〇元。晚收一二五〇〇元，一二六〇〇元。隔日頭寸利息外加。</p>
<h3>拋金舞弊並非事實</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨報載中央銀行業務局主持之拋金工作，又發生舞弊安一訊，茲據該行發言人聲明：該行拋金，有帳可稽，所傳各節，並非事實，該行並將去函登載該訊之報章更正云。</p>
<h3>銀根寬鬆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根，續呈鬆平。晨開承隔日鬆勢，日拆做開五六十元光景，業內外供單仍多。而國庫支撥及外埠匯款經常有到，幸隔日有紗布結款約卅億之譜，不無相互抵銷之作用。旋各業市塲，以時近週末，對拆單頗具戒心，銀根一度有轉穩之勢，惟下午國家行局續差出四十億元，故頭寸供應，仍呈鬆平之勢，日拆最後在五十元光景。</p>
<p>國家行局庫昨續差出四十億餘元，大交換各行差入十一億餘元，洋商各行差入約九億元，小交換各行差入約廿億元。</p>
<h3>北平小額匯款昨日續有做開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南北通匯，新華及中國實業兩銀行昨仍有小額做開，情形與日前相仿。各行櫃前能接受匯平款項之多寡，須視平行有若干頭寸可以解付而定。故目前申請匯款者雖多，惟經匯各行，以格於在平解款能力問題，一時無法大額接受。北款南匯，亦僅限於小額之家用匯款。至大額之商業匯款，做開尚有待。其他經匯銀行如上海，金城，監業等，昨仍聞有交易做開。</p>
<h3>收購梧州外匯證央行已電飭照辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會息：自政府決定將梧州開放爲對外口岸後，該地出口商人以央行梧州分行，尚未開辦外匯移轉證收購業務，頗影響該地移轉證價，對今後該地出口不無阻　。曾兩輸管會洽請央行在梧辦理此項收購業務，該會認爲此舉確屬需要，經轉函央行洽商，並已獲得該選購意，聞該行業務局已電飭梧州分行照辦。</p>
<h3>央行將設立金銀業務科</h3>
<p>中央銀行以金銀市塲成立後，業務擴充，勢須成立一專管機構，負責一切事宜。據悉：卽日將成立金銀業務科，由業務局副局長周舜莘任云。</p>
<h3>南北市米價平定　食油又起猛烈漲風　雜糧升沉不一麵粉緩步上揚</h3>
<p>南市米價上漲，北市米價平定。因上日南市低於北市，故貨主扳高，加之銀根仍鬆，無錫價漲，開市卽升二三千元。後以實銷胃口不佳，略見回落。白粳六萬五千，薄稻六萬六千，各漲二千元。北市塲價格無上落，與昨相平。二市到貨五九九九石。</p>
<p>食油　昨又起猛烈漲風，因貨稀，貨主居奇，在投機哄抬下，豆油最高至三十五萬元，收市稍回，終漲一成半。生油出四十萬大關，漲三萬五千元，生散佈油等俱漲二萬元，豆餅亦升千元。</p>
<p>麵粉　緩步上揚，晨開以頭寸鬆動，實銷權暢，老車兵船一律挺秀千元。後聞黃金報跌，人心轉疲，老車回做二萬四千七百元，兵船退站二萬三千六百八十元較前仍軋漲六七百元不等。</p>
<p>雜糧　參差不齊，黃豆因銀根鬆動，實銷極暢，且油餅激升，貨主扳高甚力。車豆挺一成，後市喊價破六關。生仕新帮依然沉寂，去化呆滯，挫落萬元。芝蔴本待納進甚多，市價挺一成。紅糧微秀，苞米先漲後回，市勢終告軋平。</p>
<h3>市塲賣氯甚濃華股被迫續降</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市況昨日續趨疲軟，國外各物，滯困鮮生，業中人心，無以刺激，自央行拋金以來，一班物價，漲跌趨勢恍惚無定，投機心理，大爲減少，而予股市打撃尤甚。因之游資趨向拆放，更因昨爲週五，舊多雙重負息，故賣氣益濱，永紗晨開七元二五，空方見納，一度升至七元三六，爲開盤後全程之最高峯，高後聞銀根走勢仍濫，　面頗欲拉抬，惟多頭深感連續挫跌，受創甚濃，故雄心已灰，於是塲上空方見活，金業帮證券帮又起而拋售，市程陷入瘟局，破七元關，而至六元九四低盤，臨收聞央行來拋黃金，浮散略有補納，步升至七元一角，最後散空再放市勢依然無望，近午以六元九五收束。中小型股，一致疲軟，各股均以低價開出，信和由二元二角小至二元收盤，新光七角七五低至六角七午收，美亞二元二角挫至二元〇三分景福勤與景綸均見低價結束，台糖低開高收走勢尚堅，華豐開收平均，無甚上落，其餘雜牌一致普跌，全日成交四一億八千九百六十五尤收。</p>
<h3>外股徵俏</h3>
<p>外股市勢微俏，進戶鑒於頭寸尚鬆，徵有點綴。但浮散戶則又逢高吐售，臨收又見疲色，怡紗做一五五〇〇元一五七〇〇元升三百元，英聯二一〇〇〇元，獨俏一〇〇〇元，業廣六五〇〇元有出，未聞成交，亞洲一五三〇元一五六〇元升三〇〇元，會德豐六五〇〇〇元六七〇〇〇元挺升二〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>黃金公債市勢尚穩，晨開三九萬，一路升至四十五萬，午收四十萬。午後初做三九萬，後市仍爲四十萬。</p>
<h3>票據交換延長時間金管局已查明責任</h3>
<p>關於前數日票據交換所違法延長票據交換時間事，經金融管理局澈查後，已將其責任問題報請財政部，分別予以處方。據記者獲悉：，此項責任可分向二方面追究：（一）票據交換所擅自延長所規定之票據交換時間，已屬違法。該所經理曹吉如慮負相當責任·並其中是否另有舞弊情事，需繼續澈查。（二）銀錢業各行莊規定每日需於下午一時，將應交換之票據送往票據交換所。而事實上各行莊較常延至下午四時或四時以後，送往交換所交抽象，有碍交換業務。各該銀錢業行莊方面，亦應負相當責任云。</p>
<h3>絲綢平疲</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市勢平軟，業外物價均平，拆放風氣流行，散戶吐　頻繁，多頭籌碼減少，本街銷路滯呆，皮球交易殊見沉悶。120號有光新貨晨開二六〇萬，開後卽見低回，爲二五七萬，午收市無起色，仍以二五七萬了結，隔日交割爲二六八萬·</p>
<p>生絲因金鈔漲勢被阻，人心已見淡薄。銀根雖鬆，納胃未烈，業外囤戶減少，高級另担初做三八五萬，嗣後微步盤小，挫至三七〇萬。D　級78勻度白　絲初做二八二萬，嗣亦回小至三七一萬</p>
<p>綢緞市勢平軟，納胃中滯，塲上交易日見清淡，　面人心甚軟，大誠晨開一八七萬，微升至一八八萬，高後散多出籠，低至一八四萬。行收回升五千元，美亞爲一八五萬午收。</p>
<h3>新龍井挫軟</h3>
<p>本年溫州新龍井，自日前登塲後，昨市仍有到滬，共約四十餘斤，到數比前雖增，惟目前尚係報信茶，故乏　額裝運，大致下週起，可望步砌。而價格方面，則與到貨背道而馳，一路降低。聞同業拆價，每斤八千元左右，較前削落二千元。揆其原因，首批應市之貨，係甫生之萌芽，且又物稀爲貴，行情哄抬直上。嗣後來貨旣多，品質亦稍遜前者，市氣卒告下游，照此情形，今後賡續看跌，然趨勢則明軟暗堅。</p>
<p>又據業中人去：今年因天時關係，雨水未能調勻，致各地新茶收成與出品，均不及往年，至於陳貨茶色，昨日市上，在業外物資平穩中，遂亦跟隨緩和，行情幾與隔日相爲伯仲。</p>
<h3>桐油漲勢已戢</h3>
<p>桐油趨勢，自接連狂騰後，昨日市上，業由顯寸雖仍泛濫，惟因實銷奇狹，買戶不感興趣，加以業外各物大都轉平，致同業心思隨之帶定，漲風頓被阻遇，臨收結果，紅白桐油，均維原盤，油青亦然。</p>
<h3>台省久旱不雨影響台糖產量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台省久旱不雨，水源大減，日月　發雷廠能量，遭受　脅。我國所恃以外銷之台糖，其產量是否將受影響，頗爲一設人士所關心。頃據經濟觀察家近由台省返滬稱：該省去年底迄今無雨，全省東部較好外，餘如南北西中，普遍發生水荒。日月潭之蓄水庫，存量不多，已實行節電運動，規定不滿一千　之工廠，每天一律供給四小時半（下午六時後開始）。居民用電，亦受限制。長此以往，農工業將蒙嚴重打撃。所幸台糖總產量，截至目前，已達四十餘萬噸。產品中以中砂爲最多。若天降甘霖，電力充足，截至五月中旬，台南屏東各廠，可再有九萬六千餘噸收穫。是則在製糖季節終了前，約共獲六十萬噸，當可超過預計五十萬噸之上。關於外銷方面，台糖在國際市塲，極爲活潑。截至本月中旬止，日本已訂購十萬噸，英國爲五萬噸，充裕國庫匪淺。至於國外暢銷原因，乃係成本較低，其關鍵在於台省經濟穩定，員酬報不豐，工潮不起。按世界著名之產糖廠，員工薪給約佔產量三分之一。目前台糖員工每月所費，僅合食糖兩千五百噸，相差不可以道里計。又如台滬限制匯款，卽員工低徼，待遇時虞不　，甚盼當局予以儘量改善。最後該觀察家并申述台糖工廠接收後，努力向增產途中邁進，成績斐然。現擁有員工蔗農，共約二萬五千人，直接間接賴以生活者，約一百萬人。其逐年工廠器材之補充，肥料之供應，及週轉金之運用等，在在仰給於央行及台省政府之去助，并不假借於美援部份耳。</p>
<h3>工廠領用配煤　展期下週一截止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市工業會息：關於本市各工廠領用配煤事宜，因工業會體念各工廠資金週轉困難起見，特與烟煤調節會商洽延展購煤日期，業經該會應允展期至下星期一（三月廿八日）。在此期間內，各工廠均可購買，惟須依照當日價格付款云。</p>
<h3>貼放工礦顧問昨日舉行例會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會工礦顧問委員會第卅五次例會，於昨日下午三時半舉行，出席朱迪九等十四人，共提出審查案件十四件，計通過十件，供下週貼放委員會提出審核。會後繼續召開生產及出口事業貸款審查委員會，共提出案件二十八件，迄發稿時，會議仍未結束。</p>
<h3>國慶細布暢銷</h3>
<p>本市安樂紡織廠出品英雄牌·金錢牌絨綫，各地均售，該廠近又大量生產十二磅國慶細布，品質精良，爲各界所樂用，行銷殊廣。</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>— 看臺客</p>
<p>原是利多因素現竟不起作用</p>
<p>大家覺得奇怪：現在銀根很鬆，拆息又高，可是物價好不起來，股價更其消沉，寗非怪事？</p>
<p>財金當局聽了笑迷迷：暗地裏忖着現行辦法，有道理。</p>
<p>難道現行高利息政策，真是阻制了囤貨活動嗎？假使現在「物價好不起」，是現行施策的收效；那才是怪事呢！</p>
<p>但是有一點是毫無肄問的：每天市價軋漲一成多，有貨的人人，都不以爲漲，這種不以日漲一成爲滿足的巨大欲望，確實是現在高利政策唯一造成的功蹟。</p>
<p>這種功蹟，值得不值得稱道？值得不值得恭維？請央行當局自省自省罷！</p>
<p>銀根鬆，利息高，貨物漲不起也者，乃指漲不出利息之謂。是何道理？道理很簡單，不是怕央行壓力，也不是怕高利太重，拆穿了講，尚在大環境情勢不對。</p>
<p>大環境之下，生命能否確保，尚成問題。若然再背了一大堆貨物，絆手脚，不是自討苦吃嗎？</p>
<p>過云，不背貨，太吃虧。現在收收利息也不壞；那就覺得比囤貨活靈得多了。因爲隨時可以應變，單講這一點，高利似有看台客效果了。但是大環境不如今天這般局勢，那末旣有利息做底盤，囤貨條件更優越了。所以問題，還在大環境，不在高利息。</p>
<p>然而，高利息政策，在當局的應變方針而論，那是絕對正確的。</p>
<p>因爲人人放利渡日，只做以紙　紙的生意，發出來的鈔票，於是銷路大好。此其一。</p>
<p>大家在以紙賺紙，因此沒有人云和發鈔當局搶購貨物。當局之以軟變硬，便可隨心所欲了。此其二。</p>
<p>現銷荒，妙到迄未輕減。因而沖淡了膨脹發行的罪過。同時加重了膨脹信用的責任。</p>
<p>「膨脹信用」云云，向來是當局用着一副正經面孔，把通貨膨脹責任轉嫁給商人身上的籍口。</p>
<p>現在大環境影響若干商品在瘟檔裏，照理信用膨脹不起來，但現銷拉緊，作用就非膨脹不可了，又有高利息的引誘，放不出時也想椏出了。</p>
<p>這就可以揭開一個奧秘了。現鈔荒加高利貸，是製造並且加速信用膨脹的二大原料。信用，發行膨脹的罪愆，便可以沖淡了。</p>
<p>當今金融措策奧妙實在無窮</p>
<h3>紗市交易清淡棉布走勢疲挫</h3>
<p>紗市前途難以業觀，市上銀根購乏人，因一般對國行拋售棉紗及金我銀及金銀等，咸具戒尺，故沉北之局面，難於打開，納戶踟躕不前，塲中交易清閒。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由四百二十五萬元，一路盤至四百十二萬元收市，較前挫一萬元。四〇支藍鳳則高二萬元，三二支銀月晨開二百七十九萬，旋晋至二百八十一萬元爲最高，收市復退至二百七十五萬元，終降一萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨自二百十萬元高檔開出後，卽鬆落至二百〇五萬元，臨收浮空稍有抵補，價乃回至二百〇六萬五千元結束，終升一萬五千元，廠單最後做二百〇五萬元，二〇支雙馬衙昂一萬元，其他各紗起伏範圍俱狹，結果略有升沉。</p>
<p>棉布市勢疲莫能興，綠因本街納胃平庸，客帮則無意動辦所致，昨日塲內賣氣濃厚，疲　之局面，一晨難望好振。</p>
<p>龍頭細布晨初以隔日八萬四千五百元之午收價開出，中途　面帮曾起拉提，一度晋至八萬七千元，臨收聞業外物品均皆平疲，人心渙散，漲勢終告不繼，乃退至八萬四千元結局，較前挫五百元。</p>
<p>中檔細布如喇叭童與五福等，皆各降二千元左右。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰自八萬二千元一路盤旋至八萬二千五百元爲最高，終爲八萬〇四百元，微挫一百元，四君子元直貢獨挺五百元，士林布及其他色布等，本客去化俱狹，民營廠營業大有一落千丈之勢。</p>

<h3>爲哀軍仁餘獻計今夕如何抗盟主</h3>
<p>要是前夕仁餘不爲回力所挫，則今晚對華聯之役，將是一塲頗關進出之比賽，蓋仁餘如能制華聯，將與華聯同一兩敗之戰績稱雄，自敗於回力之後，又顧得這塲球不够刺激，皍仁餘諸將，一定是已把高潮的情緒，降落一段的。</p>
<p>不過－我倒以爲仁餘今旺夫臉還該重視這一塲球，如能壓倒盟主，雖與錦標無綠，也該是件美事，何況本屆仁餘自得洋教練訓練，復得蔡金典助陣，徐仲已返歸，早潛伏着這雄心，豈能以此而消沉？</p>
<p>事實上，仁餘本屆要想打退你給的聯，尚非其時，茍能長此以往戮力同心，下屆今日，也許可有希望，卽以今日假定我是華聯軍師，也有必破仁餘的錦囊妙計。然而－現在我想趁仁餘受　回力之餘，更不爲華聯所忌的機會，爲仁餘一謀，則哀師夫使不可創一奇績。</p>
<p>以今日華聯之戰策論，必然攻以穩，守緊逼爲主。綠華聯之攻守，素以慢穩稱，而今日對仁餘之守，將取緊逼之道，使擅用方法之仁餘無從發揮也。如是，仁餘應取對症下藥之攻守。反其道而行之，取攻利用速度，守可迂緩對付，攻速是避其緊逼，冀能在長力方面爭取勝利，守迂緩是不所操之過急，而造成無謂犯規，亦可由迂緩中減少對手射籃機會，失分亦可隨之減少也。仁餘如能做到這一點言微意重的工作，華聯必感頭痛。</p>
<p>在各方面講，華聯決不止於遭仁餘覆師，但筆者爲示弱者的呼聲，也同時壯一壯仁餘健兒失敗於回力後的紛亂情緒，爰作此文。亦所以增迷兄之興趣耳。（必賢）</p>
<h3>另塲甲組海青對麥令女子比賽約翰會星華</h3>
<p>四屆籃球聯賽，今日下午五時半起計有甲女組三塲，在體育館逐鹿，門票照舊，樓上五百元，樓下一千元，及塲內對號座一千五百元。今賽甲一組佔二塲，其中華聯對仁餘一仗，精彩可期，故勢有一番盛沉，球迷欲睹好球，自應早去爲妙。對號座上午十時開始預售，普通座下午一時發售，大門四時半開放，並請四維童子軍維持秩序。</p>
<p>聯賽當局通告：最近內塲秩序混亂殊屬非是，今日一律憑票進塲，並請嚴守秩序，以免妨礙球賽進行。今日秩序與裁判名單如下：</p>
<p>約翰－星華（女組）五時卅分</p>
<p>海青－麥令斯（甲一）六時一刻</p>
<p>華聯－仁餘（甲一）七時一刻</p>
<p>女子組約翰再逢星華，首先上塲，第一循環星華以四十對卅三奏捷，該隊上週戰和黎隊，且一路前導，足證已恢復其雄厚之戰鬥力，約翰雖有朱敏，張羅羅，林靜怡三位好手，但欲報復一箭之仇，恐非易事。</p>
<p>繼爲甲一組兩番同室操戈，前戰麥令斯曾以四十三對卅九獲勝，此次當謀再造勝利，該隊近部彌佳，愈戰愈勇，銳不可當，海青今日將有却爾敦艦替代作戰聞實力頗厚，決非阿蒙之流，則屆時兩支美軍會師，緊張刺激鏡頭必多。</p>

<h3>今日甲組足球　龍頭遇戰青白　幼級盃螢光對磐隊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕沉寂了多時之足球聯賽，本週又轉入密鑼鼓緊階段，今天甲組一塲，下午三時卅分龍頭再逢青白於逸園。明晨精武戰羣力，下午則舉行市長盃決賽。　今天下午一時一刻有幼級盃複賽一塲，螢光曾撃敗公交而膺丙組總錦標，磐隊乃乙組錦標隊，在市長盃僅以一零比負於中航，此塲複賽勢秘有劇戰。</p>
<p>聯賽第一週時龍頭曾慘敗於青白之手，邇來兩隊狀態均不佳，致在市長盃時，龍頭負於志超，青白負於中航；經兩週來之休息，兩強養精蓄銳，磨勵以須，青白在新敗之後，能否保持在聯賽中之長勝榮譽，撃於此戰。</p>
<p>青白自瞿永福傷足息影後，前鋒乏理想之中鋒與右翼，陣容不及第一週時完整，全隊守勝於攻，羅壽福爲前綫　之靈魂，彼若能與金祿生有默契之合作，仍足予龍頭後防以威脅，不過小羅是前鋒綫之「活脈」，苞被監視，則全綫之進攻力將受影響，故龍頭抑制青白之攻勢，則必須掣肘此綠耳也。孟義良是中流砥柱，薛與姜之技與時日俱進，仁義勉任左內衛，非其本職，商蚷馳河難以及遠，故在此路較有可乘，茍若從中路力衝青白之堅壁，則不啻事倍而功半耳。</p>
<p>龍頭之硬派作風，具有特長，其攻勢之急峻有如排山倒海而來，勇則有餘，智尚未足，蓋過於勇剛者欠謀亦極易於摧折，龍頭似殊乎近之。其比賽時一鼓作氣挾其全力以赴，攻堅不下，致再而衰三而竭，精神受挫折，形勢大爲逆轉，在第一週負於青白時，雖操着優勢而竟召致慘敗者，卽此理也。前事不忘，後事之師，龍頭諸將當不致再蹈往昔之覆轍，進攻時當注意運用兩翼之夾撃，內鋒宜運用冷靜之頭腦，誘其左而襲其右，避其實而蹈其虛，勿過度耗費氣力，故在位置上應有聯撃之聯絡，不作瞎跑以浪費氣力。</p>
<p>後防王寳山有大刀闊斧之踢法，前內衛俱有堅脆之脚之穩健可靠，在防衛方面要設法箍制着青白之小羅與金祿生之聯絡綫，蓋小羅與小金在得到有隙可乘時，就有提腿破關之本領，所謂「驚鳥將撃，卑飛歛曾獲，猛獸將搏，弭俯伏，」羅與金敲關，必先有動靜，任衛者應知所應付也。雙方陣容如下：</p>
<p>青白</p>
<p>黃仕傑</p>
<p>錢長榮　姜閣清</p>
<p>伏酒堂　張仁義　孟義良　薛沛然</p>
<p>生　羅壽福　劉隆馨　經靈桂　顧以撒　劉體寅</p>
<p>龍頭</p>
<p>閻承賓　高維辰</p>
<p>鄭秉彝　李承先</p>
<p>吳顗敏　王寳山　史大法</p>
<p>張金根　姜琨　王步榮　陳勤　夏樹福　姚慶昇</p>
<h3>民主盃足球　第一週秩序排出</h3>
<p>民主盃足球中級組已成尾聲，僅剩磐隊與公和祥之落選　決賽一塲，將於明日上午十時舉行，裁判員方榮富，巡邊員王琳瞿錫根，勝者亦准予升格。高級組於下週揭幕，並定每星期二，三，五，日四天爲固定比賽日期，每週至少踢四塲，如遇天雨則以一，四，六等空晶補賽。除星期六與星期日之比賽於下午三時開始外，其餘均下午四時開始，一俟白天較長，則開賽時間將再酌量延遲，俾盡量顧到球員之本位工作，茲將第一週秩序錄下：</p>

<h3>央航小球克金康</h3>
<p>央航小型足球隊昨應戰勁旅金康隊於龍華機塲，由姚　華担任裁判，央航舊部陳龍泉來歸，實力陡增，雙方劇戰下，由陳龍泉初破紅心，下半時金康隊欲　舊恨，奈央航後防堅固，難以得得　而守門董錦才猶似神助，挽救險球不秒，結果一比零中航初傳捷報。該隊歡迎界函約比賽，通讀處龍華機塲中央航空公司越</p>
<h3>美豐籃球隊成立</h3>
<p>美豐籃球隊係熱心體育之陳海生與心隊方璉等組織，業於昨日假起士林宣告成立，該隊　迎約賽，通訊處體育館對園美心酒家，名單如下：</p>
<p>（領隊）陳海生，（顧問）張葆奎，黃漢，（幹事）徐健華，（管理）岑耀垣，葉雲洲，葉雲青，劉康，林忠華，蕭穆，　士元，陸榮，王正。</p>
<h3>蘭州運動塲地苦乏經費建築</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州訊〕春回陸都，一切體育活動將及時展開。蘭州市體育館的建立，又舊事重提，可是市體協兩三次集議，迄無一個結果。它的困難第一是地址問題，過去想利用關園的空地，塲地够了，可是觀衆却無法押足；紅山根的公共體育塲面積大，但又離市區較遠，在交通不便的情況下，還不適宜。其次是工程費的問題，郭主席郭市長雖然都提倡建立，可是這一筆錢的數目相當大，西北又無售門票舉辦比賽的習慣，恐怕籌募起來很費力。</p>
<p>去年冬天警備司令部爲募集冬賬款建立的滑冰塲，成績很不環，現在憶凍解冰消，圓滿結束了。這塊冰塲的地皮，是中山林的公產，過去設有綱球塲，因爲綱球這項運動，在西北人眼裏看來，是貴族化的玩意兒，現在有很多人呼籲在這塊地皮上開闢一個小型游泳池，市體協憶接受這個建議，並考慮過水源，經費等問題，大致沒有什麽困難，可是陸都的夏天很短暫，天氣炎熱得並不長久，這項運動怕也難得引起大衆的興趣。</p>
<h3>女籃球圈</h3>
<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>談大學學生軍約翰隊</p>
<p>照理，今天我該寫星華，但是爲了照片關係，我想下週再寫星華了。且來先寫約翰隊。</p>
<p>這是一去大學學生軍，而且本屆大學聯賽中與滬江並列首席，成績應該不惡，可是她在聯賽中略勝於殿軍力隊一籌而已，這是頗使人失望的。</p>
<p>在條件方面講：該隊是比任何隊要優越，好像年齡方面的適當於運動，以及從羣衆揀選　出來的精粹。更甚者，她舞每天相處在一起，有好的塲所，有現成的指導，這些比人家便宜的條件，不知該隊是不是在利用？</p>
<p>再看現實方面，她舞的幾位隊員，像張羅羅的高度，周志芬的活躍，朱敏李淼的分健碩，姚惠娟的聰明，林靜怡的頭腦，在各個分析起來，多是上駟之材，這肅說，再加上條件的好，約翰無論如何不該沒有較好的成績，可是－要是你冷眼一看，她舞的確有着極明顯的缺點，第一是林靜怡朱敏基本動作都還嫌不够，所以她舞的後衛有出手雖快，缺少目標，前鋒則不是失之於太慢，便是一快便沒有繩凖，浪擲之多，可爲各隊之冠，更是不能利用跟進，因此獲分叉無由了。其次；該隊有一個普遍的隨便心理，從服裝上看，是一個明證，從遲到上看，又是一個例子，這雖然是以運動爲主，不以勝負爲先提，也不是一件壞事體。唯是在求球藝進步增加水凖及興趣，也是要緊，不知幾位學生軍以爲何如？</p>
<p>講到教練一節，最初是吳新運，現在是戚公兄了，她無雖然有着教練，演出則好像始終沒有一點方法，完全不像一個有組織的隊伍，流露出烏合之衆，各自爲政的成績，據悉戚公兄擔任教練，爲時未久，以後在他指導之下，這一個改進是應無肄問的。</p>
<p>旣難於在她無一隊戰術中作研討，還不是對她無個人方面的優劣作一小評。</p>
<p>林靜怡－是該隊的獲分之論，一記過頂擲籃頗有道理，可惜因爲比較矮小，就容易被人家關煞，要是她能進一步研究避人工作，則大佳矣。</p>
<p>張羅羅－有着與王珊一肅好的身材，要是她能有籃下跟進的本領，腕跳繩，也許有裨益的</p>
<p>吳漢運－她的中短投射不壞，唯有二個毛病，有時她出手太慢，被人攔阻，有時則失之太快，距離籃圈太遠，她要能折中些，便能成一個理想鋒將。</p>
<p>朱敏－確是一個好鋒，就是因爲她已脫離母校，難得來出席乃是該隊的損失。</p>
<p>李淼－她是凖後衛的典型，有強壯的體格，及有力的腕力。奔跑也够，就是對於籃球的基本動作還未到把，於是事倍功半，難能討好了。</p>
<p>姚惠娟－後衛中最出色的一員，能搶奪，及利用地位阻人，頗有可取，由於經騐未足，未能爐炎純青，假以時日，自有厚望。</p>
<p>周志芬－前大軍女子鑒於隊的健將，亦老將也，但似乎缺乏練決，無頗峯演出，成績衹有退化，不見進步。</p>
<p>以上，筆者對於該隊下了不少的評語，不免過於主觀，唯確具有一番誠意，祝該隊，在優良的條件中，得戚公史的指導後能竿頭日上，一日千里，勉旋健兒</p>

<h3>別笑得太早</h3>
<p>— 司徒勺</p>
<p>——讀書偶記</p>
<p>看了蕭伯納的書，總覺得說真話也不容易。</p>
<p>說真話必須要有慧眼，有卓識，能够從華麗的外表下發掘出卑汚，從卑汚的深處發掘出真實的高貴來。但爲難的還不在此。最叫人心灰意懶的是：你說了真話，別人却以爲是諧謔。正如馬戲塲失火，小丑在台上發急，喊：「失火了，救命呀！」而台下却拍手叫好，以爲小丑在演滑稽插曲一肅。</p>
<p>對於人類未來的悲劇性，蕭伯納幾次提出了警告，可是獲得的反應只是台下的拍手叫好。</p>
<p>看到了一點皮相而來不及地鼓掌，却忘記了事實的悲劇意味，這肅的人，不曉得是他在笑蕭翁的戲曲呢，還是蕭翁的戲曲在無形中批他無的面頰。</p>
<p>多一點思索，就會多一分理解。</p>
<p>看蕭翁的書，千萬不要笑得太早了。「哲人笑在最後」。有時候，你所看到的事實的滑稽性，遠不如你「笑得太早」的那付嘴臉更滑稽。</p>
<p>我無習慣於卑汚，因此當我無看到了較高貴的事物，就會覺得可笑。同理，我無習慣於說謊，忽然聽到了哲人說的真話，倒會以爲是批謔了。</p>
<p>這是蕭翁的軼事：</p>
<p>有一天，蕭翁到眼科醫生那里，去檢查眼睛，醫生說他的眼睛很正常。最初，他以爲所謂正常，卽與普通一般人一肅。後經醫生說明：正常的眼睛並不與普通人一肅，正是與一般人不一肅。有像他的這種正常眼睛的人，在全倫敦找不到十個。</p>
<p>這對他是一個啓示：普通人的所謂反常，才真是正常。</p>
<p>多一分思索，就多一分理解。多理解了，他就會羞慚於笑得太早了。</p>
<h3>新式的留聲機</h3>
<p>— 毓</p>
<p>經過多少年的實騐以後，一種新式的留聲機，已在美國上市了，而且價錢並不比一架無綫電收音機貴。它可以代你聽電話，記錄無綫電節目，留下你的小寳寳初出世時的那一聲呱呱之音，還可以用來記錄法庭上的辯論，或者會議上的演講。</p>
<p>那種聲音記錄，可以保持永遠不壞，不論你重開多少次。它又可以很容易+地消除而反覆重用。它可以保存在任何氣候或任何狀況之下，不致損壞。</p>
<p>這種新式留聲機，是根據磁化原則造成的，它的形式雖有許多種，却以留聲機的大小，與一架桌上收音機差不多。留聲機的內部，有兩個炸麵卷那肅大小的綫圈。綫圈之間，繞着兩哩長像頭髪般的電綫，可供連貫錄音一百三十五分鐘之用。這條電綫　的錄音原理，正如普通留聲機片一樣。</p>
<p>當電綫經過磁性的錄音機頭時，它便按照頻率和聲音，把聲音錄了下來。只是電綫上所留下的，並不是點或綫，而是磁性的印象，憑肉眼觀看，那條電綫與未錄音前並無二致，因爲它並沒有發生物理的變化。</p>
<p>錄音完畢後，電綫便繞到第一個綫圈上，因爲錄音與播音，電綫必須順着同一的方向進行，錄間機同時便是播音機，只是當播音的時候，機頭便作爲發音機同，其作用正如唱針在留聲機片上的移動一樣。</p>
<p>這種新式留聲機，可以附裝在無綫電收音杣，有些附有自動開關，能在某一節目開始的時候自動錄音，而在節止終了時自動關閉。這就是說，當你要在晚上去看一個非看不可的電影，而同時又不願意錯過一個非聽不可的無綫電節目時，你只要調節好自動開關，回家的時候便可從留聲機補聽到那個無綫電節目了。</p>
<p>它又可以附裝在電話機上，當你出外的時候，它會記錄下朋友無留下的言語，你回家時，把它一開，便可聽到報告。</p>
<h3>一九四九型的汽車</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>與其說一九四九型的汽車爲「車」，倒不如稱之爲「陸上游艇」更合式。它不像是爲適合車主的需要，倒更像是專爲攬在櫉窗中或彩色廣告上來煊耀的。</p>
<p>一九四九型的新車是龐大的，定價美金二千元。有人把一九四一年的車子賣掉，換了一部一九四九型的，但開到家裏就遇到了難題，因爲沒法把它駛進車間去，——車子太寬，太長。</p>
<p>這種寬而長的車子，是爲了適合「流綫型」的目標，同時也更是對那些買了一九四七年型車子的人一種心理上的脅迫，使他無覺得自己駕駛的是老古董。</p>
<p>一位專家說，這種車子價格貴，不經用，不適用。然而，無論如何，它是一九四九年型的。車廂後面的行李倉，足够你擺一架鋼琴在裏面。</p>
<h3>百無一用是書生</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>生活的威脅在一天天的加重。然而看看別人，依然是優哉遊者的享受，眼前便又浮上了「百無一用是書生」的感想。</p>
<p>其實，「文章誤我」，只是無用書生的遁詞。文章何曾誤過了他？「咄咄書空」，倒是不敢面對現實的書呆子的寫照，說明他只有「書空」的本領。這是我失業以後的心得。</p>
<p>偶然借到一部「飄」，本來是拿來消閑的，然而却使我發現了自己之所以會感覺生活壓迫的　結。白瑞德不是這部小說裏最有錢的一個嗎？他的有錢是因爲有辦法，而他的有辦法則在於看得到「一個制度的興起，或一個制度的崩潰，都是發財的好機會。」他不但面對現實，且又看清了事實。至於這是否有背於書呆子的道德和良心，那又是另一回事了。</p>
<p>其實，自從抗戰直到現在，我無何嘗缺乏白瑞德型的英雄？例如發國難財的，發勝利財的，發接收財的，真是多如過江之鯽；就是發和平財的，恐怕現在和將來，都不敢說沒有口誅。筆伐，澈查，懲處，在他無看來，只是說「酸葡萄」的把戲而已國。</p>
<p>又如爲大衆所看不起的黃牛黨吧，他無又何嘗不是白瑞德型的英雄？他無搶戲票，搶車票船票，搶配給米，配給油，搶黃金，直到現在的販賣銀元，又何嘗不是把現實看得清，拿得凖？</p>
<p>上面所說的英雄，雖有大小強戌之不同，但他無的能把握時機，利用時機，則是如出一轍的。根據優勝劣敗的自然律，並不能說這是社會的不公允。</p>
<p>現在不是有人在感嘆一位大學教授的收入，遠不及一個三輪車夫；一個公教人員的生活，還趕不上一個小販嗎？這是事實，但也是自然律的自然現象。誰叫你脫不下長衫，攞不脫書生觀念的羈絆，誰實爲之？孰令致之？</p>
<p>我承認，我自己也是深由長衫觀念流毒的一份子；我也相售，如果一旦能脫下長衫，我一定比較的有辦法。然而直到現在，還沒有脫下長衫的勇氣，則又是實情。</p>
<p>怨天尤人，多餘的的舉動。所以「百無一用是書生」，也只不過是自欺欺人的烟幕罷了。</p>

<h3>再記「生死恨」</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>三月十八日本談所登的「生死恨」試片參觀記，僅寫其輪廓，茲再分唱，做，及導演手術三點言之。</p>
<p>第一，唱：全劇中元板，快板，搖板，南梆子，二六各腔，都好；尤動人者，如「夜訴」中之倒板起，「耳邊廂又聽得初更鼓響」一段，配以王少卿的胡琴，真是纏綿悲凉得未曾有。「尼庵夜遁」起西皮快板之唱，「番奴爲人太可恨」一段，及「訣別」一塲，一面掩門，一面起哭頭散板，「屋漏雨，雪上霜」一段，同時以水袖表情，可謂酣暢淋漓。</p>
<p>第二，做：梅博士的水袖功夫最深，一舉一動，美極，如「夜訴」織布時的手姿，唱「只落得，對孤燈，獨守空房」，兩手皆出水袖外，以兩指指燈，各種姿勢，真是美到極點。西洋人的舞藝，有腰的宛轉美，有腿的動作美，梅博士的水袖表情，可稱之爲手的舞美。又如「拷打」時的躱棍，（舊劇有一專門術語，余偶忘之）。其身段及水袖，皆合於舞姿，乃是東方藝術的美，非有真功夫者，不能到此地步。「夢幻」中的面部嬌羞，及初見程鵬舉時的眼神，真如費穆先生所言：「他把婦女的角色演到婦女舞的靈魂深處了」。</p>
<p>第三；關於導演手術，全體無懈可撃。如「尼閹夜遁」時之景色澄明，一派幽雅情緒，其繞樹之圓塲，以舞台之技術，融合於電影，可謂天衣無縫，譬如繪畫，在方寸之內，居然有尋丈之勢，又如韓玉娘之死，導演者並不演出屍倒的惡象，只於韓玉娘唱最後一句「月冷泉台」，幕上現出窗外一丸月色，人口不見而歌聲仍裊裊不絕如縷，卽此收塲，真有留餘不盡之意。導演費穆先生言：「我沒在平淡中做到絢爛」。但我則以爲此片淡雅而彩色，正是他的成功。</p>
<p>總之，此片優點太多，以上不過就我參觀時所得一知半解，舉出一點，以爲看此片者之一助。</p>
<p>再此成果原本爲齊如山所編之易鞋記，其故事出於陶宗儀之輟耕錄，經許姬傳君整理重編，始改爲生死恨今名，並誌於此。</p>
<h3>請醫生記</h3>
<p>— 俆卓之</p>
<p>我舞鄉下有句話說：「窮人不生病，好比交大運」。自已因爲從來很少生病，所以雖是一直交着大運，總不甚清楚了然。真至上星期，生了一點小病，雖只躺了四天，但却化去了我這半月的薪水，方知窮人生病之不幸。</p>
<p>病是突然來的。前一天下午從寫字間回來，因爲淋了雨，入夜有點發熱，到早晨則頭昏頭腦脹，臉也燒得發紅。原想多喝點開水，硬挺過去，但到第二天，情形竟更糟了，熱度憶高到一百〇三度左右，才有點急起來了。想想，這回可非請教醫生不可了，醫院去掛號門診吧，實在掐扎不起床來；而且天又下雨，恐怕冒雨一淋，病反弄糟。想來想去，只好請一位醫生來出診了。</p>
<p>請的是一位中等的醫生，因爲有名的醫生請不起，而太　脚的又怕醫不即，白糟蹋了錢。下午，醫生來了，坐着一部開動時嘩啦作響的舊吉普卡。妻自然很着急，囑囑囌囌地把起病的原因以及這兩天的情形等等說給他聽，還問他：這是什麽病要不要緊。但醫生似乎對此種種絲毫不發生興趣，「唔唔」了兩下，拿出聽筒來聽了一聽，看了看舌頭，坐下來開了一張龍飛鳳舞的藥方，關好皮包凖備要走了。前後不到一刻鐘。</p>
<p>「請問，多少診費？」</p>
<p>「唔唔，兩萬六千，另加車費八千塊。」</p>
<p>我在床上聽了，嚇了一跳，好像微微出了身冷汗。三萬四千！家裏一共才三萬五千塊錢。</p>
<p>沒有辦法，只好把鈔票點給了他。至於藥方呢，妻立刻帶了兩只大頭出去配，幸好藥倒只要五千多，所以只賣了一只大頭。擾藥房裏的夥計說，只是些阿司匹靈之類的發散的藥。我深悔不該小題大做，請這趟醫生。</p>
<p>病是好了，也許是這一身冷汗嚇好的。想想，醫生何以要如些好　頭，而拿了人家那麼多錢，又仍是那副愛理不理的神氣，真是令人百思不得其解。難道非如此，不足表示其醫道的高明麼？</p>
<p>一切生意都有成本，利潤和再生產等等因素，其定價，多少要根據這幾種。公用事業就是一例。則醫生何以一次出診要收到兩三萬呢？至於車費，那是另收的，儘够其汽油費而有餘，醫院難不能說是公用事業，但至少和小民的性命息息相關，我覺得當局倒是不可不注意一下的。因爲理髪，洗浴，客飯等等都要由社會局來規定，則醫生的診費，尤其是醫院的門診費，何以竟能不聞不問，聽其自然？這是乘人之危，社會局更加就能該挺身出來制止的事呀。</p>
<p>寫到此，一位朋友來談，看了一笑說：「你何必騷呢？這還算好的哩。我有一個朋友，去牙醫生那裏拔牙齒，醫生沒有說要多少錢，只說：便宜的，便宜的。不料等鉗子夾從頭再來　了牙齒，醫生氫鉗子很命搖了兩搖，害得我那位朋友痛得眼前發黑，幾製乎暈去，却見那位醫站在前面，斤擒鉗子，惡狠狠地瞪着我那位朋友道：你說！你出多少錢？」</p>
<p>我聽了，倒抽了一口冷氣</p>
<p>自已的牢騷也就不敢發下去了。</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 25th] It is reported that the Communist troops who left Qishui, eastern Hubei, are moving towards Anqing. In addition, Zhang Zhen, Chairman of Henan Province, arrived in Hankou by special train on the evening of the 24th to report to Chief Bai on certain matters and will return to Xinyang within days.</p>
<p>[Our Xiaogan Dispatch, 25th] The military confirms that the Communist army's Chen Geng Corps simultaneously entered Yingshan and Luotian in eastern Hubei on the 21st, declaring that they would soon cross the Yangtze River between Tianjiazhen and Wuxue and go to Jiangxi.

<h3>Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight and Tariff Adjustments to be Made Monthly Starting Next Month; Legislative Yuan Passes Calculation Based on Cost Index</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The method for adjusting railway, postal, and telecommunications freight and tariffs was passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 25th after intense debate. It stipulates that railway, postal, and telecommunications freight and tariffs can be adjusted according to the cost index, once a month, starting from April 1st. Each operating entity must also effectively reduce redundant personnel and tighten expenditures within May of this year, and the staffing levels should be restored to pre-war standards. Given the significant price differences in postage across regions, zonal regulations may be implemented. The case was originally a "Method for Adjusting Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight and Tariffs According to the Cost Index, Related Implementation Measures, and Trial Operation Conditions" submitted by the Executive Yuan for review. During the preliminary review, the railway, postal, and telecommunications authorities directly adjusted rates according to the method, causing widespread anger among legislators. Therefore, the original method was completely revoked during the review and changed to adjusting rates according to the cost of living index for public educators. When submitted to the general assembly for discussion, some committee members believed that the costs of various graduates should be considered, and it was decided to appoint a committee for joint review. The second review overturned the method of adjusting according to the cost of living index for public educators and restored calculation based on the cost index. However, the compilation of the cost index was significantly reduced compared to the original plan of the Executive Yuan. According to the opinions of the review committee, the revised formula significantly reduced prices compared to the original formula. For example, the reduction for railways was 20%, for postal services 31%, and for telecommunications 39%. Committee members also believed that to reduce costs, redundant personnel in various transportation operating entities should be effectively reduced, and expenditures should be tightened. In addition, postal rates should be proportionally regulated in southwestern and northwestern regions, where living standards are lower and prices are cheaper, to reduce the burden on the people. When the matter was raised for discussion at the Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 25th, it sparked heated debate and controversy. Committee members paid particular attention to the corruption and redundancy of personnel in transportation operating agencies. It was claimed that, taking the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway as an example, before the war, there was an average of only 18 employees per kilometer. The Ministry of Communications stipulated that there should be 24 employees per kilometer. The two railway bureaus have a total length of 482 kilometers. According to pre-war standards, only 8,678 people were needed, or 11,568 people according to the Ministry of Communications regulations. However, the road currently has 23,588 employees, more than 10,000 extra. Employee expenses account for more than 50% of costs. Therefore, only by reducing redundant personnel and tightening expenditures can costs be reduced and freight rates be lowered. Therefore, the resolution that transportation operating entities should reduce redundant personnel and tighten expenditures, and that staffing levels should be restored to pre-war standards by May of this year, was passed smoothly. After item-by-item discussion and a second reading during the meeting, the third reading was omitted, and the method for adjusting railway, postal, and telecommunications freight and tariffs and all related matters for improvement were passed.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Adjustment Method</h3>
<p>The full text is recorded as follows: "Method for Adjusting Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight and Tariffs"</p>
<p>(1) This method is formulated in accordance with Article 20 of the State-Owned Enterprise Management Law.</p>
<p>(2) Railway and postal rates may be based on pre-war freight rates and adjusted separately with reference to the current cost index after being submitted to the Executive Yuan for resolution by the competent authority. (3) The method for compiling the cost index is as follows: (A) The cost index for railway freight is based on the following items: (A1) Labor costs account for 45%, which is calculated by multiplying the average rice price index of designated stations along each route by 63% (the average monthly income of current employees is 63% of the average pre-war income). (A2) Coal and fuel costs account for 40%, which is calculated according to the different sources of prices and the proportion of their usage. (A3) Foreign equipment costs account for 6%, which is calculated by multiplying the certificate exchange rate of the US dollar by one-third. (A4) Domestic equipment costs account for 3%, which is calculated using the average cement price index. (A5) Office expenses and other expenses account for 6%, which is calculated using the average rice price index. (B) The cost index for postal rates is based on the following items: (B1) Labor costs account for 50%, which is calculated by multiplying the average rice price index of designated regions by 63% (the average monthly income of current employees is 63% of the average pre-war income). (B2) Transportation costs account for 22%, of which 12% is calculated using the railway freight index, and 10% is calculated by multiplying the certificate exchange rate of the US dollar by one-third. (B3) Business expenses and other expenses account for 28%, of which 16% is calculated using the average newsprint price index, and 12% is calculated using the average coarse cloth price index. (C) The cost index for telecommunications rates is based on the following items: (C1) Labor costs account for 47%, which is calculated by multiplying the average rice price index of designated regions by 63% (the average monthly income of current employees is 63% of the average pre-war income). (C2) Business expenses account for 28%, which is calculated using the average newsprint price index. (C3) Material costs account for 25%, which is calculated by multiplying the certificate exchange rate of the US dollar by one-third.</p>
<p>(4) The cost index multiplied by the pre-war railway and postal rates is the freight and tariff to be adjusted. However, adjustments should be appropriately reduced, at least by 5-6%, and may be adjusted once a month. If the index increase rate does not exceed 20% of the previous adjustment amount, no adjustment will be made.</p>
<p>(5) Price survey areas: (A) Railways: Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway; Hangzhou, Nanchang, Pingxiang, or Zhuzhou on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway; Guangzhou, Hengyang, and Wuchang on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway; Hengyang, Liuzhou, and Guiyang on the Hunan-Guizhou Railway; Kunming and Qujing on the Kunming area Railway; Hankou and Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway; Xi'an, Baoji, and Tianshui on the Longhai Railway; other routes are not listed temporarily due to military reasons. (B) Post and Telecommunications: Guangzhou, Kunming, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Guilin, Chengdu, Fuzhou, and Taipei.</p>
<p>(6) Investigating authorities: The previous prices were verified by railway, postal, and telecommunications agencies in conjunction with the local governments and chambers of commerce or trade associations in the above-mentioned locations, and then reported to the Ministry of Communications for approval.</p>
<p>(7) The calculation formula for railway, postal, and telecommunications freight and tariffs is as follows: (See attached table)</p>
<p>(8) The implementing rules of this method shall be formulated by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>"Matters for Improvement Related to this Case"</p>
<p>(1) The railway and postal subsidies approved by the government shall be allocated in one lump sum before the 5th of each month according to the subsidy amount for the previous month, and any shortfall shall be made up before the 5th of the following month.</p>
<p>(2) Military transportation and telecommunications expenses shall be paid monthly in cash.</p>
<p>(3) State-owned transportation operating entities shall reduce redundant personnel and tighten expenditures, and their staffing levels shall be restored to pre-war standards by May of this year.</p>
<p>(4) Article 4 of the Postal Law should be revised so that it can be applied to Article 20 of the State-Owned Enterprise Management Law and the provisions of this method.</p>
<p>(5) Postal rates in each region may be proportionally regulated based on price differences.</p>

<h3>Calculation Formulas for Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight and Tariffs</h3>
<p>Calculation formula for railway freight: (A) Adjusted freight rate: Pre-war freight rate base × cost index × discount</p>
<p>(B) Cost index = 45% (63% × rice price index) + 40% × coal price index + 6% (% × US dollar exchange rate) + 3% × cement price index + 6% × rice price index</p>
<p>Calculation formula for postal rates:</p>
<p>(A) Adjusted postal rate = Pre-war postal rate base × cost index × discount</p>
<p>(B) Cost index = 50% (63% × rice price index) + 10% (% × US dollar exchange rate) + 12% × railway freight index + 16% × newsprint price index + 12% × coarse cloth price index</p>
<p>Calculation formula for telecommunications and telephone charges:</p>
<p>(A) Adjusted telecommunications and telephone charges = Pre-war telecommunications and telephone charge base × cost index × discount</p>
<p>(B) Cost index = 47% (63% × rice price index) + 28% × newsprint price index + 25% (% × US dollar exchange rate)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan to Hold Ninth Meeting on the 30th; New Cabinet to Deliver Policy Report; Three Financial and Economic Bills Resolved Yesterday to be Reviewed Together</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The ninth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 30th, at which the policy report of the new cabinet will be heard and questioned. The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee met on the 25th and only added the case proposed by Wang Yisheng and others, "The Postal Law contradicts the State-Owned Enterprise Management Law, proposing to amend the Postal Law," to the agenda of the next Yuan meeting for discussion along with the seven bills not discussed at the eighth meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The ninth meeting of the Legislative Yuan was originally scheduled for March 29th, but that day is the Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs, and all agencies are closed for one day. Tong Guanxian proposed at the Yuan meeting on the morning of the 25th to hold it on the 30th, which was passed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The eighth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 25th, chaired by Tong Guanxian. After reporting on matters, the following were discussed: (1) Yang Buping and others proposed that the Yuan should consult the government and negotiate with the CCP to agree on a time and place to start peace talks. The case had been passed by the previous Yuan meeting and only needed to be organized. The government has now appointed representatives and notified the Communist side, and there is no need to submit this case. It was resolved to retain it. (2) Yang Baodong and others proposed to issue special national salvation bonds to stabilize the currency and prices, establish economic credit, and stabilize social life in order to save the national crisis. It was resolved to submit the case to the Finance and Economics Committee for review. (3) The President consulted the Executive Yuan and requested that the financial and economic reform plan be promulgated in accordance with the provisional clauses of the Constitution. It has been clearly ordered by the government to promulgate it for reference. (4) Zhu Huqing and others proposed that the current economic situation is extremely critical, and the government's financial measures are chaotic, the policies are unclear, there is no budget for revenue and expenditure, and the issuance is endless. The recently promulgated financial and economic reform plan is even more of a mess. The Yuan should, in accordance with Article 59 and Article 57, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, resolve to request the government to change and correct it as soon as possible in order to save the situation. (5) Qiu Hanping and others proposed that in order to unify the currency system and implement the silver standard, the gold yuan notes should be recovered, silver dollars should be re-minted, and silver dollar notes should be issued to stabilize prices and benefit the people's livelihood. The above three cases were discussed together and resolved to be submitted to the Finance and Economics Committee and the Budget Committee for joint review. The meeting continued at 4:00 PM, and the chairman announced a change to the agenda, advancing the review of the "Method for Adjusting Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight and Tariffs." After being revised and passed (see separate article), the revision of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law and the Legislative Yuan Committee Organization Method continued to be discussed. Due to time constraints, it was decided to move it to the next meeting for discussion, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Arrives in Taiwan from Xikou; Zhu Shaoliang Accompanies Him and Will Stay Briefly Before Returning to Fuzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 25th] Chen Cheng, Zhu Shaoliang, Yan Jiagan, and others returned to Taipei on the 25th at 4:00 PM on a special Tianxiong aircraft. Chen and Zhu flew to Ningbo on the 24th and then went to Xikou to see President Jiang and stayed overnight. They flew to Taiwan at 2:00 PM on the 25th. Because the Fuzhou airport is under repair and cannot land, Zhu will stay in Taiwan for a few days and then return to Fuzhou. Chen is scheduled to meet with reporters on the 26th to announce the progress of this trip.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Taipei Dispatch, 25th] After Chen Cheng flew from Xikou to Taipei on the afternoon of the 25th, he replied in writing to reporters from various newspapers, saying: "I arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 23rd and arrived in Xikou on the afternoon of the 24th. I stayed overnight in Xikou and saw President Jiang. He is in good health and spirits. President Jiang did not give any instructions regarding Taiwan, but hopes to strive for stability in the rear and work hard to increase production so that the people's lives can be improved." Chen also said in his written statement: "During this difficult period, the new cabinet was able to be quickly formed and the agency was simplified, which is very well received by all parties. Peace talks have not yet begun, and it is still difficult to report on the future progress." Regarding the simplification of provincial agencies, Chen said: "Taiwan province has many business agencies, and those that are unnecessary have been automatically reduced."</p>
<h3>Wang Shijie on Taiwan</h3>
<p>The Legal Nature is Different from Japan and Germany; There is Absolutely No Question that It Belongs to Our Country</p>
<p>[United Press Taipei Dispatch, 25th] Former Foreign Minister Wang Shijie stated in a speech at the Rotary Club yesterday that the Chinese government has full sovereignty and freedom to rule Taiwan. Wang's remarks were obviously to refute the recent widespread speculation that the fate of Taiwan will be decided in the future peace treaty with Japan. Wang pointed out that the legal nature of Taiwan is different from that of Japan and Germany for three reasons: (1) When China declared war on Japan in December 1941, it stated its intention to abolish the treaty in which Taiwan was ceded to Japan. (2) At the Cairo Conference, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union agreed to return Taiwan to China after the war. (3) In 1945, Japan was defeated and signed an unconditional surrender document, so there is absolutely no question that Taiwan belongs to China. Taiwan has been enslaved by Japanese imperialism for 50 years, so peace-loving Chinese people must concentrate their efforts to defend the region to prevent another wave of imperialism. If the people of Taiwan do not guard against the CCP's attack under the command of the Third International, they will fall into another dark period and lose their freedom and independence. There is no freedom in the areas occupied by the CCP, the facts are all there. Some so-called liberal figures have remained silent about the situation in Peiping and the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Baeger Arrives in Hong Kong for a Six-Day Goodwill Visit</h3>

<h3>Song Ziwen Arrives in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 25th] Song Ziwen arrived in Guangzhou on the Foshan steamer on the morning of the 25th. Those traveling with him included Mrs. Song, Xu Shixuan, Lu Wenlan, and others. According to people close to Song, he came here to visit various friends.</p>
<h3>Peace Talk Representatives Discuss All Day; Military Chiefs Participate in Discussions on Troop Reorganization; Will Travel Immediately Once the CCP Sets Time and Place</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Government peace talk representatives met all day on the 25th to discuss preparations for various issues related to the peace talks. Acting President Li also participated in the discussion. The content was quite extensive. In addition to Huang Shaohong, who is still in Hong Kong, Zhang Shizhao also rushed to Nanjing on the night train of the 24th. In addition to the four peace talk representatives, Xu Yongchang, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, Gu Zhutong, and others also attended the meeting at the Ministry of National Defense at the invitation of He Yingqin at 10:00 AM. He Yingqin presided over the meeting, which did not end until after the meal. It is heard that the theme of the meeting may be related to the issue of troop reorganization. After the representatives took a short rest in the afternoon, they went to He's official residence in Menjizha for dinner at 7:00 PM and continued to discuss various issues. At 9:00 PM, Acting President Li also attended the meeting, which did not end until midnight. According to official sources: The government's peace talk representatives are only waiting for news from the CCP. Once the CCP specifies the location and time and representatives, our delegation can travel immediately. The start of peace talks can be expected soon, and the government's opinions on peace talks, Acting President Li and President He are consistent. The current discussions are preparations for some detailed issues.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] It is widely rumored here that the peace talk representatives may depart for Peiping within ten days, but officials cannot yet confirm this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Shao Lizi was re-appointed as the government's peace talk representative with the CCP after a resolution by the Executive Yuan today. However, Shao expressed that he is not optimistic about the future of the peace talks. He said: He had already requested the government to resign from his position as a representative, but it was not approved, so he had to reluctantly take on this important task again. He believes that there are many practical difficulties in the peace talks. If the CCP insists on the eight conditions, the future of the peace talks is not optimistic. However, he will reluctantly take on the role of representative and do his best, taking one step at a time.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Li Zheng told reporters: He is not optimistic about the future of the peace talks, but at the same time, he also emphasized that he is not pessimistic. He said: Because peace is now the demand of all the people, we must make sincere efforts to achieve it.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Legislative Yuan members Chen Ruxuan and 34 others, and Huang Jianzhong and 23 others, proposed two identically-worded motions in the Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 25th, requesting that before the government's peace talk representatives depart, they be invited to attend a plenary meeting of the Yuan to exchange views on the peace issue, which was passed unanimously.</p>
<h3>Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Others Arrive in Peiping; CCP Party and Military Headquarters Move to Peiping to Work</h3>
<p>[Associated Press San Francisco Dispatch, 25th] On the 25th, the CCP broadcast still referred to Peiping as the former capital and has not officially named it the capital.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The CCP's Peiping Radio broadcast that the CCP Central Committee and the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army moved to Peiping to work on the 25th. Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, Lin Boqu, and others flew to Peiping at around 4:00 PM on the 25th. Lin Biao, Ye Jianying, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo, and others went to the Xiyuan Airport to welcome them.</p>
<p>[Associated Press San Francisco Dispatch, 25th] Political observers here believe that the relocation of the Communist Party headquarters to Peiping indicates that the Communist Party is preparing to start peace talks, as Communist leaders hinted earlier this year that they were prepared to start peace talks after completely occupying Peiping. The fact that the Communist Party headquarters has now moved to Peiping means that the date of peace talks is not far away.</p>
<h3>North-South Navigation and Exchange of Materials; Shipping Industry Formulates Plan; President He Orders Submission to Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] National shipping industry representatives Wei Wenhan, Li Yunliang, Hu Shiyuan, Shen Qi, Zhong Shandao, and Shanghai Maritime Bureau Director Hong Ruitao, along with eight others, arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 25th for the issue of North-South navigation and maintaining shipping rights. Wei and others visited President He at Doujizha at 8:00 AM, Sun Yueqi at 10:00 AM, Duanmu Jie and Guo Chan at 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM respectively, and Shao Lizi at 5:00 PM. They are scheduled to visit Acting President Li on the morning of the 26th. Wei and others carried a detailed report on negotiating navigation issues in Peiping and a plan formulated in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan. In addition to navigation, they also put forward concrete suggestions for the exchange of materials between the North and the South, and are scheduled to return to Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 26th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] After the shipping industry formulated a concrete plan for North-South navigation and the exchange of materials in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan, President He has appointed Ministers of Transportation Duanmu Jie, Minister of Economic Affairs Sun Yueqi, and Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun to convene a meeting for review in the short term. Once the official plan has been reviewed and completed, it can be submitted to the Administrative Yuan meeting for approval and implementation. The content of the plan stipulates that the navigation locations include the Qinhuangdao-Shanghai and Tianjin-Shanghai lines. The categories of materials to be exchanged also extend to items other than coal and flour. The North can exchange coal, caustic soda, soybeans, and other items for tea, sugar, and light industrial products from the South. As for the technical issues of passenger travel incidental to navigation, they remain to be further negotiated. It is widely believed that both the government and the CCP are actively promoting the early realization of navigation for the convenience of the people of the North and the South, and navigation is expected to officially begin next month.</p>
<h3>Huang Shao-gu's Hasty Trip</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Returned to Beijing the Same Night</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Executive Yuan Secretary-General Huang Shao-gu arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. In the morning, he visited General Tang Enbo with a friend, and he took a train back to Beijing that night. According to Huang, his trip to Shanghai was purely for personal matters and there were no other missions involved. The rumor that he was searching for senior personnel to join the Executive Yuan is unreasonable. When asked if the Executive Yuan was preparing to move back to Nanjing, Huang said that in the future, political affairs would be handled in Nanjing and administrative affairs would be handled in Guangzhou. How to connect them is a technical issue, and he himself is prepared to run between the two places. Premier He will visit Guangzhou, with the date set after he gives a policy report to the Legislative Yuan. Regarding the peace talks, Huang said that it would be better to say less. The government's peace plan has not yet been completed. Whether there are differences of opinion between Nanjing and Guangzhou, he did not know the details because he had only attended one meeting in the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Hang Liwu's Remarks in Taiwan: Seeking to Improve Professors' Salaries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Taipei, 25th Dispatch] Minister of Education Hang Liwu stated that the universality of national education in Taiwan Province is the best in the country. Building on this foundation to develop education is indeed promising. He expressed great concern about the salaries of professors in universities and colleges in the mainland, saying that he would do his best to improve them, but due to limited funds, it is still difficult to say how much practical benefit can be achieved. He will be flying to Beijing soon.</p>
<h3>Ma Hongkui to Fly to Beijing in a Few Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Lanzhou, 25th Dispatch] Ningxia Chairman Ma Hongkui, in response to a telegram from Acting President Li, will fly to Beijing in a few days. However, due to the spring thaw at the Ningxia airport, aircraft cannot take off or land. The runway is currently being reinforced. If this is still unsuccessful, Ma will come to Lanzhou and take a plane east.</p>

<h3>Stabilize Anqing!</h3>
<p>Just as the calls for peace talks were hanging by a thread, the flames of war in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have rekindled, which is extremely worrying and distressing. According to a special dispatch from Nanjing in yesterday's edition of this newspaper, after completing their reorganization and replenishment, the communist forces north of the Yangtze River have formally begun to gradually increase pressure on the Nationalist army's bridgehead positions. Among them, starting from the border of Hubei and Anhui, with the exception of Yuxikou (opposite Wuhu), Jiangpu, the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, and Dahekou (southeast of Luhe), which remain relatively calm, there are still small-scale skirmishes in Yizheng, Shierwei, Guazhou, and Shijiaqiao. The Nationalist forces, limited by the terrain, had to automatically abandon Kouan (south of Taixian), Qianshan, Taihu, Wangjiang and other places on the 21st. In the Anqing area, starting on the 22nd, more than ten thousand communist troops were discovered marching south in two routes from Qianshan's Gaohebu. The Nationalist forces fought and retreated, and are now concentrated on the line of Jixianguan West Road Wanshankou Town on the outskirts of Anqing (more than ten miles from Anqing City), engaged in fierce fighting. At the same time, the personnel of the Anhui Provincial Government, who were originally working in Anqing, also began to evacuate to Tunxi via Wuhu at this time. General Xia Wei, the former chairman of Anhui Province, will be in charge of military affairs exclusively, and the position of chairman has been announced by the Executive Yuan to be filled by Zhang Yangchun. These signs all indicate that the situation in central Anhui has indeed reached a critical stage, and the flames of war on the north bank of the Yangtze River will be difficult to avoid due to the active advance of the communist forces.</p>
<p>Anhui is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, both north and south, and the terrain advantage lies on the north bank. Anhui Province is the abdomen of the Yangtze River, and Anqing is its provincial capital, facing the Yangtze River. Its geographical value lies in its reliance on the Yangtze and Huai rivers as mutual defensive barriers. Since the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign last year, when Tongcheng and Hefei fell into the hands of the communist forces, Anqing's situation has become increasingly isolated, with a superficial rather than substantial defense, becoming a bridgehead on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, controlling the outer perimeter of the capital. Therefore, the gain or loss of Anqing is extremely important, relating to the status of the capital and the traffic on the Yangtze River. Gu Zuyu of the Ming Dynasty pointed out the importance of Anqing's position in his book "Essentials of Historical Geography": "Anqing Prefecture is the barrier of the Huai River and the pivotal point of the Yangtze River. Xu Cong said: 'Anhui's territory, if China (note, meaning central China) obtains it, can control the area south of the Yangtze River; if the area south of the Yangtze River obtains it, it can also benefit China. And Xiaogu has always been a place controlling the Yangtze River.' Thus, Anqing is the gateway to Jinling; Xiaogu is the gateway to Anqing." Gu Zuyu revealed the relationship between Anqing and Jinling based on the historical experience of the Jin people invading south. The military failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the Qing Dynasty was also due to the loss of Anqing's strategic advantage. Hong Yang believed that the Yangtze River was a natural barrier, which could ensure the safety of Jinling, but they failed to deeply understand Gu Zuyu's warning. Zeng Guofan led the Xiang Army to attack the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and besiege Jinling, first taking Anqing as the main camp. As a result, the Yangtze River was pacified successfully, and the effect of controlling both the inner and outer regions was achieved. This was Zeng Guofan's success in understanding history and geography. From the above geographical advantages and historical evolution, it can be seen that the gain or loss of Anqing is by no means just a gain or loss of Anqing alone, but is greatly related to the fate of Nanjing and the safety of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Our modern military and political strategists, especially the generals who currently only rely on strong armor and sharp weapons, often neglect geographical advantages and historical experience, which often leads to major mistakes. In the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign last year, abandoning the Huai River to defend the Yangtze River, making Anqing's situation isolated, can be said to have already led to a major mistake. Zhao Fan of the past said, "With the Huai River, there is the Yangtze River; without the Huai River, the area north of the Yangtze River is full of reeds and rushes, where the enemy can all secretly cross the river. With thousands of miles of the Yangtze River, how can we defend it from all directions?" This shows that with the Qin and Huai rivers defending the Yangtze River, it is already quite difficult to defend. Now, the communist forces are taking advantage of the opportunity of peace talks and the government's indecision over the past two or three months to prepare to lightly take Anqing, a water and land defense area, from the junction of the Huai River, well-versed in historical facts. However, the military and political leaders of the capital seem to have failed to pay attention to the deployment and intentions of the communist forces, and may repeat major mistakes, leading to an irreversible situation. In the past, when the Jin soldiers divided their forces to invade Anhui Province, the Yangtze and Huai rivers were in imminent danger. At that time, Qiu Chong was the pacifier of the two Huai rivers. Someone advised Chong to abandon Luhe to defend the Yangtze River. Chong secretly said, "Abandoning the Huai River is to share the danger of the Yangtze River with the enemy. I will coexist and perish with Huainan." Although the general trend was unfavorable and Qiu Chong's hard fighting failed, General Qiu's insight wrote his glorious deeds in the history of war. This is sufficient for later generations to deeply reflect upon.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation of the communist forces, militarily, they intend to break through the bridgehead line from Wuhan to Nantong on the north bank one by one, as a convenient route for the next step of crossing the river eastward. Politically, they are using military force as a backing for peace talks, intending to obtain an overwhelmingly advantageous negotiating condition to achieve the practical effect of a surrender under the city walls. This two-pronged offensive seems to have already started with the attack on Anqing. Therefore, the gain or loss of Anqing is not only related to the survival of all the bridgehead positions on the north bank, but also greatly related to the conditions discussed during possible peace talks. In order to ensure the attainment of genuine peace, on the one hand, we hope that the communist forces will not use military attacks to exert pressure during the peace talks; on the other hand, we hope that the government will learn from historical experience and lessons, and should not easily give up Anqing in its efforts to strive for peace!</p>
<p>In short, the abandonment of Anqing will lead to the risk of the severance of water transportation on the Yangtze River, and even the threat of the loss of the capital's safety may immediately arise. This situation is unbearable to imagine! Therefore, stabilizing Anqing and seeking peace have the same important value today. We believe that Acting President Li's efforts to prepare for peace and Premier He's cabinet's efforts to prepare for the defense of the Yangtze River are equally indispensable, like the two wheels of a cart. Whether they can closely coordinate to achieve their tasks should be tested by the defense of Anqing.</p>
<h3>The "Heping" (Peace) Steamer on the Hong Kong-Guangzhou Route Exploded and Sank After Hitting a Mine; Less Than Half of the More Than 500 Passengers Survived</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou, 25th Dispatch] The "Heping" steamer (formerly known as "Lihang"), sailing on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route, known in foreign dispatches as the "Miss Orient," recently hit a mine in the Pearl River after the Shimen steamer. The steamer departed from Guangzhou for Hong Kong at 9:00 p.m. on the 24th. At about 10:00 p.m., while sailing through the waters of Humen, it suddenly hit a mine, which exploded on the left side of the ship. The entire ship immediately capsized. At that time, there were more than 500 passengers on board. Currently, only 225 people have survived. The rest were either killed by the explosion or are missing. Eight injured have been transported back to this city for treatment. The local maritime administration, seafarers' union, and relevant authorities have dispatched personnel to provide rescue. In addition, the steamer belongs to a British company and recently began sailing on the Hong Kong-Guangzhou route. It weighs about a thousand tons and has a dance hall, and is known for its splendor.</p>
<p>[Reuters Hong Kong, 25th Dispatch] The steamer "Miss Orient," traveling between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, hit a mine about six miles from Guangzhou last night. It is suspected that the mine was planted by bandits, as the ship had received threatening letters demanding "protection money" for several months.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Member Cao Xuan Reports to the Control Yuan: The Main Reason for the Departure of the Chongqing Warship Was Friction Between Naval Factions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] Supervisory Committee members Cao Dexuan and Lu Fengkai, who went to Shanghai to investigate the case of the departure of the Chongqing warship, returned to Beijing on the morning of the 25th. At the Control Yuan meeting on the morning of the 25th, Cao reported on the investigation process. According to Cao, the most important reason for the departure of the Chongqing warship was friction between naval factions. The original captain, Deng Zhaoxiang, belonged to the Mawei faction, while the newly appointed captain, Lu Dongge, belonged to the Qingdao faction. The issuance of the order to change the captain aroused dissatisfaction from Deng Zhaoxiang and the Mawei faction officers and soldiers on the ship, and therefore they left in anger. It was neither due to excessively poor treatment nor due to the conspiracy and instigation of the Communist Party. According to General Commander Gui and Chief of Staff Zhao, the treatment of the officers and soldiers of the Chongqing warship has always been better than that of other warships, and there were no signs of dissatisfaction beforehand. However, the departure of the Chongqing warship may have been a temporary premeditated act by Deng Zhaoxiang. On the 21st of last month, when the Naval Headquarters held a meeting in Shanghai, Deng ordered the deputy captain, who was not from the Mawei faction, to attend, and ordered more than forty other sailors who were not from the Mawei faction to go ashore. When the appointment of the new captain was announced on the 21st, the Chongqing warship left on the 22nd under the pretext of a sea trial, sailing seventeen nautical miles that day and then turning back. Based on this information, it can be known that the Chongqing warship intended to leave. Because if it was a sea trial, it only needed to sail thirteen nautical miles, and its return was also due to heavy fog. After the Chongqing warship left, no communist soldiers boarded the ship until Yantai. When it reached Huludao, more than two hundred communist soldiers boarded the ship and replaced the original gunners on the ship. The reason why there was no fierce resistance when the air force bombed was because of this. After Cao's report, several committee members spoke, believing that Gui could not shirk his responsibility, but some committee members also believed that further detailed investigation should be conducted, and advocated that the case of impeaching Gui Yongqing should be seriously considered.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] Supervisory Committee member Cao Deyi stated during his report on the investigation of the Chongqing warship incident at the Control Yuan meeting: The rumor that a large amount of gold and silver was stored on the ship was not true. There were only 300,000 silver dollars for the welfare of the officers and soldiers on board. Committee member Cao also revealed that in addition to the Chongqing warship, the Huang'an and Changbai warships and Landing Craft No. 201 also defected from the naval system.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] Regarding the departure of the Chongqing warship, Legislative Yuan members Li Yaxian and others proposed that Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang, Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, and Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing attend the meeting to explain the reasons and responsibilities, and investigate the case of the missing Commander of the Thirteenth Pacification Zone, Wang Lingyun. The proposal was resubmitted to the Legislative Yuan meeting on the morning of the 25th, and it was decided that the new Premier of the Executive Yuan would attend the Legislative Yuan meeting on the morning of the 30th to deliver a policy report, and the military authorities could be invited to attend the report that afternoon, at which time questions would be raised. The meeting passed without dissent.</p>

<h3>Ganoderma Lucidum</h3>
<p>Discovered in Baokang, Hubei Province</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hankou, 25th Dispatch] According to a certain news agency: Zou Kun'gang, a resident of Linsen Street in Baokang County, Hubei Province, recently discovered "Yunzhi Grass" in a mountain valley.

<h3>US Policy Statement on China: Truman Unwilling to Issue; Congressman Herter Criticizes US Policy of Silence on China</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 24th Dispatch] President Truman told a press conference on the 24th that he did not think a statement on China policy should be issued, so there would be no statement on China policy in the near future. The President made this statement when answering a question about the possibility of issuing a statement on China policy in the near future. His answer seemed to be consistent with the State Department's policy of not issuing a US statement on China policy. At the same time, Republican Congressman Herter had previously denounced the US policy of silence on China in a speech to the House of Representatives. A copy of his speech was distributed by the post office in Washington. Herter said, "When the Secretary of State has to discuss our China policy in a closed meeting, there is obviously something wrong. If our China policy is clear and rational, then the questions we raised to the President in the letter should be answered publicly and clearly." Herter said, "The State Department has not only failed, but has succeeded in making communist progress unhindered. We, like the executive branch of the government, should be responsible for the security and glory of China."</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 24th Dispatch] Democratic Senator McCarran announced today that the State Department has submitted a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, deciding to no longer support the Chinese government.

Connally has received a reply from the Secretary of State.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Replaces Six County Magistrates</h3>
<p>Strengthening the County Magistrates' Conscription Performance</p>
<p>[Taibao Hangzhou, 25th Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Government today replaced six county magistrates.

<h3>Opening Up Navigation Rights on the West River: He Cabinet to Correct</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] According to authoritative sources: Regarding the former Executive Yuan's decision to designate Wuzhou as a foreign trade port and open up navigation rights on the West River, the He Cabinet will investigate and correct it after its establishment. According to an explanation from a responsible government official, opening Wuzhou as a foreign trade port is the same as Chongqing and Hankou, where customs can be established for settlement, but it does not mean opening up the navigation rights on the West River. In the past, it was misunderstood that the West River could freely navigate foreign vessels. In the future, corrections will be made through diplomatic channels.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] Regarding the recent decision by the Executive Yuan to designate Wuzhou as a foreign trade port and open up navigation rights on the West River, this reporter visited Legislative Yuan member Li Yunliang, who has always strived to protect navigation rights, and asked for his opinion. Li said that the West River is a beautiful inland river of our country, and its importance in terms of economy and national defense is no less than that of the Yangtze River. Since the signing of the Mackay Treaty between China and Britain in the 28th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the Maritime Customs, led by the British, promulgated the West River Trade Regulations, opening up Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Sanshui, and Wuzhou as trade ports, Baitukou and other six places as temporary ports, and Maning and other ten places as passenger landing places. The navigation rights on the West River were lost and became the sphere of influence of British ships for half a century. It was not until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War that Britain, the United States, and other countries abandoned various privileges they enjoyed in China, the most important of which was the right of inland and coastal navigation. For example, the Sino-British New Treaty stipulated (1) His Britannic Majesty abandoned all existing treaty rights under the "Treaty Port" system in China. (2) Abandon the privileges granted to its ships in Chinese territorial waters regarding coastal trade and inland navigation. The navigation rights lost for many years have thus been recovered. The inland navigation rights of the West River have also returned to the embrace of the motherland. In the past four years, the results of the efforts of the shipping industry in Guangdong and Guangxi have resulted in a total of 854 national ships of various sizes, totaling 56,615 tons, regularly sailing in the Pearl River Basin. The freight and passenger transport to and from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Wuzhou is extremely convenient. Currently, the tonnage already exceeds demand and is often less than half full. Whether in terms of sovereignty or facts, there is no reason to reopen the inland navigation rights that were recently recovered.</p>

<h3>First Group of Foreigners Leaving North China Says Tianjin Has Become a Commercial Ghost Town; If the Current Situation Continues to Develop, It Will Be Reduced to a Village</h3>
<p>[United Press Seoul, 24th Dispatch] The first group of foreigners allowed to leave the communist-controlled North China area told the United Press on the 24th that Tianjin has become a commercial "ghost town." Sixteen foreigners and fourteen Chinese arrived in South Korea from Tianjin two days ago on the "Hanyang" steamer. According to the foreigners, the foreigners in Tianjin have not been harassed by the communists, including the White Russians. The movement of foreigners in the city has not been restricted.</p>
<p>Travelers quoted communist officials as saying that they hope for foreign trade and that all businesses at home and abroad will flourish again. However, business in Tianjin is now completely stagnant. Some foreigners in Tianjin believe that if the communists can restore prosperity to Tianjin without relying on foreign aid to maintain foreign trade, the communists will squeeze out foreign merchants. Another traveler said that communist officials have not contacted foreign consulates. They believe that the Communist Party is implementing the policy of "Your government does not recognize me, and I do not recognize you."</p>
<p>Another traveler said that the Communist Party is still "groping in the dark." The Communist Party obviously lacks knowledge of basic principles such as foreign trade, banking, municipal management, and operating port facilities. He believes that the Communist Party is indeed working hard to make Tianjin prosperous, but if the current situation continues, Tianjin will become a "village." Communist leaders also admitted that they had failed to manage the city. Although the Communist Party has not had any contact with any foreign consulates, it has negotiated with foreign merchants. At the same time, foreign merchants in Tianjin jointly sent a letter to Dong Biwu, chairman of the North China Government of the Chinese Communist Party, stating the situation of the commercial depression in Tianjin.</p>
<h3>News from the Former Capital</h3>
<p>Shops Lack Patrons, Unemployment Increases Daily; Americans Are Hated, but American Dollars Are Loved and Valued</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from This City] A certain gentleman who once worked in the press circles of Beiping, in a letter to a friend in Shanghai this month, the 14th, briefly described the situation in Beiping, saying: Beiping under the rule of the Chinese Communists has both bright and dark sides. Society has been completely renewed, and the performers on stage are beyond our imagination. The line between special people and ordinary people is extremely clear, but I admit that the new authorities are superior to the old forms in certain respects. However, poverty is visible everywhere, shops have no customers, waiters in restaurants are drowsy all day long, ordinary people are selling their belongings to maintain their livelihoods, and unemployment is increasing daily. The new authorities need manpower in every kind of enterprise, but they express suspicion towards those outside their circle. Their training period in universities is four to six months, and the level of university graduates can be imagined. Old newspaper and magazine editors are considered reactionaries, villains, enslaved, and stubborn. You often pride yourself on having friends on the other side; I advise you not to expect too much. Friends on the other side are useless. Prejudice cannot be shaken, and there is no real friendship between them and people from the outside world. We now do not know the situation outside, only the local situation (Note: In Beiping, except for two Communist Party newspapers, all other newspapers have been closed), and all foreign reporters have stopped their activities. Americans are hated, but American dollars are valued. The exchange rate between American dollars and silver dollars is one dollar to two dollars and twenty cents, and each silver dollar is worth 300 yuan in People's Currency.</p>

<p>Atlantic Pact Signing Date Approaching; British and Belgian Foreign Ministers Travel to America by Ship; Soviet Delegation to the UN General Assembly Travels with Them; Pacific and Mediterranean Regional Pacts Not Likely to Be Realized in the Near Future</p>
<p>[Reuters dispatch from Southampton, 25th] Foreign Secretary Bevin and British Minister of State Hector McNeil departed from here today aboard the Queen Mary bound for New York. When the ship arrives at Cherbourg, France, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko will board for America. Before departing, Bevin stated that he was going to America with a very important mission. In addition to signing the Atlantic Pact, he will discuss important international issues with Secretary of State Acheson. McNeil is going as the chief British representative to the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse dispatch from London, 4th] The British Foreign Office announced that during Foreign Secretary Bevin's absence, Prime Minister Attlee will also manage the affairs of the ministry.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris, 24th] French Foreign Minister Schuman is scheduled to leave here on the 30th for Washington to participate in the signing ceremony of the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters dispatch from Washington, 24th] It was announced here that only officially invited guests and journalists will be allowed to attend the signing of the Atlantic Pact on April 4. The signing ceremony is tentatively scheduled to be held in the State Department Auditorium, which can accommodate 1,300 people, so no one else will be allowed to enter without an invitation to attend.</p>
<p>[Reuters dispatch from Washington, 24th] Authoritative sources here say that the United States does not intend to participate in any regional pacts other than the Atlantic Pact in the foreseeable future. Diplomats from the North Atlantic Treaty nations also solemnly stated that there are currently no other regional pacts supplementing the Atlantic Pact under discussion or planned. They generally believe that because of the broad implications of the North Atlantic Treaty, there is currently no need to conclude other regional pacts. For example, Article 4 of the Atlantic Pact stipulates that the scope of discussion among the North Atlantic Treaty nations may extend to the entire world. For example, developments in Southeast Asia, Burma, Siam, Vietnam, and other places, if deemed by Britain, France, and the United States to have affected their security in those regions, can convene a meeting of the treaty nations under Article 4 of the Atlantic Pact. This discussion does not necessarily give rise to an obligation to take action, but military action is not impossible.

<p>[United Press dispatch from London, 24th] Moscow Radio broadcast on the 24th that Minister of Defense Marshal Bulganin has been dismissed, and his vacancy will be filled by Deputy Minister Vasilevsky. The broadcast pointed out that Bulganin will remain as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Bulganin's dismissal as Minister of Defense is the same as Molotov and Mikoyan being dismissed as Foreign Minister and Minister of Foreign Trade. After being relieved of their regular administrative responsibilities, the three are expected to devote themselves to higher-level political strategies, as all three are still members of the Politburo.</p>
<p>Before announcing this news, Moscow Radio broadcast that the National Congress of the Young Communist League is about to be held. The list of delegates attending the conference begins with the twelve members of the Politburo, including Stalin, Mikoyan, Molotov, and Bulganin, but one Politburo member, Voznesensky, is conspicuously absent from the list. Voznesensky was dismissed as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Planning Commission on March 14.</p>
<p>[United Press dispatch from Washington, 24th] The transfer of leadership of the Soviet ground forces adds a further layer of mystery to the recent Soviet political changes. Officials are still puzzled as to whether this kind of change represents the promotion of Soviet leaders or contains some "cleansing" factors. The most important perception here is that the Soviet Union is having its senior Politburo members devote more time to Soviet internal problems, while neglecting foreign affairs somewhat. This move may indicate that the Soviet Union may decide to stop further expansion and focus its efforts on consolidating the gains after its post.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse] Bulganin was born in 1895. Before World War II, he was the general manager of the Lenin factory, and later served as the president of the National Bank. During the war, he was appointed as the political commissar of Marshal Zhukov. He then served as the Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee, and then as Chairman of the National Assembly. In December 1944, he succeeded Voroshilov as Deputy Chairman of the Defense Committee. After Bulganin was appointed as a member of the Communist Party Organization Bureau, he was appointed as the First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and Deputy Chairman of the Union Council in March 1946. In the same year, he was promoted to the rank of Marshal.</p>
<p>Vasilevsky, who succeeded Bulganin as Minister of Defense, is 47 years old this year. He is the son of a poor peasant. He joined the army shortly before the revolution, just after turning eighteen. In 1940, he had been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General, and in January 1943, he was promoted to General. The following month, he was promoted to Marshal. At this time, he replaced Shaposhnikov as the Chief of the General Staff of the Red Army. After taking office, he commanded a major counter-offensive against the German army, driving the German army from the Don River beyond the borders of the Soviet Union. In 1944, he led the Soviet delegation to England. On May 5, 1947, he was appointed as the First Deputy Minister of Defense.</p>

<h3>Second Phase of European Recovery Appropriation Bill; U.S. Senate Begins Fierce Debate; Republican Senators Attack Britain for Trading with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters dispatch from Washington, 24th] During today's Senate debate on the $3.58 billion appropriation bill for the Marshall Plan over the next fifteen months, some senators firmly demanded that Britain guarantee not to supply military supplies to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. They expressed deep anger over a recent speech by British Minister of Commerce Wilson.</p>
<p>Wilson said that Britain will never allow trade agreements with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to be affected by political issues in the future. One senator requested that the Economic Cooperation Administration investigate Britain's trade agreements with the Soviet Union and Poland. Illinois Democratic Senator Douglas hoped that the next European aid appropriation bill could be submitted for a final vote tomorrow, pointing out that the bill must be passed by both houses of Congress before April 300, otherwise the Economic Cooperation Administration's funding will be problematic. Republican Senator Taft said that he supports reducing the bill's appropriations, but does not intend to propose reductions. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally strongly urged that the total amount of $5.58 billion be maintained, especially pointing out that the amount of aid to Britain of $640 million should not be reduced, otherwise it will delay Britain's and Europe's recovery. Republican Senator Knowland raised Wilson's speech and demanded an investigation into Britain's trade relations with Eastern Europe. Senator Vandenberg then suggested that when signing the Atlantic Pact, Britain must sign a special memorandum proving that its trade agreements with foreign countries do not contradict the purpose of the Atlantic Alliance.</p>

<h3>City Police Bureau Fully Investigates Dismemberment Case; Offers Reward of Five Gold Bars for Arrest of Culprit; Gardener's Evasive Words Raise Suspicion</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the occurrence of the headless dismemberment case on Jinyi Road, yesterday marked the fifth day, and the case's details continued to develop, causing great tension. The entire police bureau, from Director Mao downwards, paid exceptional attention to the case. To swiftly solve it, they concentrated all their efforts, investigated separately, and firmly believed that a breakthrough could be made quickly. Late last night, this reporter learned that the police bureau had offered a reward of five gold bars to anyone who provided information leading to the case's resolution. A public announcement was made that if the perpetrator surrendered to the bureau immediately, the sentence could be reduced by half. Furthermore, a person in charge at the police bureau told this reporter that in the past two days, they had obtained a highly valuable new lead in the case. However, to facilitate the investigation, they would temporarily prohibit anyone from disclosing it to the outside world.</p>
<p>In summary, the results of various investigations over the past five days have revealed five important leads in both the "person" and "thing" aspects related to the case.</p>
<p>First, regarding witness testimony: Li Chang'an, who initially discovered the dismembered body (pictured, photographed by our newspaper), may still have countless details to uncover. According to this reporter's investigation, Li is the head gardener employed by the Qilu Villa. His daily routine involves irrigating and guarding the vegetables. He regularly eats and sleeps in a small hut next to the villa (about 50 meters from the knights' office). Due to recent vegetable thefts, he gets up several times every night to patrol the vicinity of the vegetable plots. According to regulations, Jinyi Road is the only way to get to Longhua Airport and the Longhua Barracks. Therefore, military vehicles pass by all night long, but during curfew hours, there is definitely no one to be seen. The police bureau has now, based on highly reliable evidence, proven that the act of abandoning the body was done before dawn on the 21st (i.e., during curfew hours). Given Li Chang'an's awareness of potential vegetable theft, he would undoubtedly get up to investigate any footsteps he heard. However, his words were evasive, and he insisted that he heard or saw nothing.</p>
<p>Secondly, the workers repairing the road surface on Jinyi Road. According to "Old Wang," the gatekeeper of Qilu Villa, he heard them mention that on the 19th, they saw a pedicab carrying a passenger with a package heading in the direction of the crime scene. After this reporter investigated, it was found that these workers belonged to the Eighth Public Works Section of the Second District of the Public Works Bureau. They had been working on Jinyi Road for two weeks, and the section chief was Chen Shaolong. Last night, this reporter questioned them again, but they denied ever talking about this matter and said that the working hours of the section were from 7:30 AM to 5:00 PM. This situation seems to warrant further in-depth investigation.</p>
<p>There is also the woman who was once seen dumping a package on the Pujiang Ferry, who is worth investigating. Because the victim's head, fingers, toes, and internal organs are still missing, if we could find out the woman's address and further ascertain what was actually inside the package that day, then this case could easily become clear.</p>
<p>In terms of physical evidence: In addition to the saying on the calendar discovered in yesterday's newspaper, which is sufficient to roughly gauge the perpetrator's criminal motive and schedule, the oilcloth and travel bag containing the body are also important information. Due to the texture of these materials, it is impossible to leave fingerprints. Therefore, one can only use the presence or absence of soil adhering to the outside to discern the route it took when it was brought here. The detection of the Yu Shengxiao murder case on Qinghu Road in the previous year relied on a small amount of soil on the car to determine the location of the crime. According to the police bureau's preliminary examination, there was no soil, but this matter warrants further detailed examination.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter also visited the Longhua and Xujiahui sub-bureaus, which border the local branch. They have another view of the case: namely, that the box corpse case at the North Station and the dismemberment case occurred only three weeks apart, and the packages contained women's clothing. Both victims have not had any family members come forward. All of this can be seen as the two cases being related, or even a planned action by a certain organization. Or it could be that after the box corpse case occurred, the perpetrators turned on their accomplice due to distribution of spoils, conflict, and other reasons, leading to the dismemberment case. They further believe that the case most likely occurred within the urban area of the city. At the same time, due to the location of the discovery in the southern suburbs and the thorough washing of the dismembered body, the place where the perpetrator acted is especially likely to be in the major buildings of the southwest district. They suggested that they could cooperate with the French Water and Electricity Company to investigate the recent water consumption of major apartments. Because washing the body and flushing away the internal organs would require a lot of water, if the water consumption in a certain place on a certain day greatly exceeds its usual average consumption, then inspecting its sewage pipes and nearby sewers would certainly yield a shocking discovery.</p>
<p>As for the total weight of the dismembered body, the police bureau re-verified it yesterday, weighing it at 97 pounds. The woman's hair found inside the package was also properly preserved. However, in order to actively search for the victim's head and internal organs, the police bureau has decided to dispatch a large number of well-trained police dogs starting today, dividing them to search in various places, hoping to obtain another important clue from this.</p>
<h3>District Prosecutor's Office Examines Dismembered Body and Orders Burial at Pushan Villa</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The day after the dismemberment case on Jinyi Road was discovered, District Prosecutor Wang Youfeng, accompanied by forensic doctor Zheng Tingpin and inspector Shao Guojun, went to Tongren Fuyuan Hall to examine the body, and instructed Pushan Villa to arrange the burial. Yesterday, the office issued an examination report stating: The corpse is missing the head, neck, and internal organs (because the abdomen was cut open, leaving only small organs and half a kidney). The nipples are flat, slightly brown, and the genitals were cut off, with pubic hair remaining at the root. The torso was divided into upper, middle, and lower sections, and the lower limbs were cut into several pieces. The thighs were very fat. The whole body was cut into 32 pieces, and each muscle had no blood adhering to it, indicating that the victim was murdered and then dissected. As for the cause of death, it is impossible to prove because the head, neck, and internal organs are missing, leaving only muscles.</p>
<h3>No Progress in Hangzhou Regarding Train Box Corpse Case</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Hangzhou on the 25th] Regarding the train box corpse case, the police department has requested the Zhejiang Provincial Police Bureau to investigate. This reporter spoke with Director Zhou Kang yesterday about the investigation. Zhou said that the letter from a Hangzhou resident, which stated that a box containing a person was found under the Yongjin Ning, had been investigated and found to be inaccurate. They also went to the area near Yongjin Gate to investigate, and everyone claimed that no such person exists.</p>
<h3>Paper Strip Found Inside Woman's Jacket Sleeve Reveals Origin and Background</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The most thought-provoking piece of evidence in the dismemberment case is the paper strip found inside the sleeve of the woman's jacket in the package containing the body parts. Judging from its words and meaning, it seems like a maxim and may be an important clue in the case. Therefore, this reporter searched through more than 600 pages of the "Collection of Ancient and Modern Chinese and Foreign Maxims" but found no such statement. In addition, we thoroughly examined diaries and various calendars printed with maxims, but also found nothing. Then, at midnight on the 24th, we suddenly discovered a maxim at the bottom of the page for October 21st in this newspaper's calendar, the full text of which is "人之有仇於我可忘而不可念" ("One should forget rather than dwell on the grudges others hold against me"). Compared to the paper strip in the dismemberment case, it only has one extra "而" ("and") character. We quickly took this unused calendar and inspected it page by page, and were shocked to discover that the calendar for February 11th had the eleven-character maxim "人之有仇於我可忘不可念" ("One should forget, not dwell on the grudges others hold against me"), which is exactly the same as the paper strip in the case. Subsequently, it was determined that the calendar was produced by the Hua Xin Calendar Factory.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter visited the Hua Xin Calendar Factory and inquired with the personnel who edited the maxims for this calendar. According to them, there are a total of four similar maxims, and their order is as follows: first, "人之有恩於我可念不可忘" ("One should remember and not forget the kindness others have shown me"), second, "人之有仇於我可忘不可念" ("One should forget rather than dwell on the grudges others hold against me"), third, "人之謗我也能辯不如能容" ("When others slander me, it is better to tolerate than to argue"), and last, "人之侮我也能防不如能化" ("When others insult me, it is better to transform than to defend"). The arrangement dates were February 10th to 13th and October 20th to 23rd. Regarding the extra "而" ("and") character on October 21st, it was explained that it was an unintentional addition. However, these four maxims had never been used before and were included for this year only. The source and origin of the maxims could not be stated in detail. However, according to this reporter's research, a similar meaning can be found in the words of Tang Ju to Lord Xinling in the Strategies of the Warring States: "There are things that cannot be forgotten, and there are things that cannot be forgotten. The kindness others have shown me should not be forgotten. The kindness I have shown to others should not be forgotten."</p>
<p>Hua Xin Calendars this year come in ten different sizes, horizontal and vertical, and all are printed with maxims. The only difference is the slight variation in spacing during the arrangement. The paper strip found in this case was checked page by page against the February 11th calendar produced by the factory by the police officer in charge of the Changshu Branch, and the results matched the one published in this newspaper yesterday, which can truly be called a coincidence.</p>
<h3>Ancient Tomb in Changzhou Seems to Have Been Robbed; Expert Returns from Visit and Discusses; Believes It Still Has Excavation Value</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Kuan, director of the Municipal Museum, and Jiang Dayi, director of the Art Department, went to Changzhou a few days ago to investigate the ancient tomb discovered outside the South Gate, and have now returned to Shanghai after completing their task. According to their observations, the tomb may have already been robbed, because when the city defense troops discovered the tomb, they were digging trenches in the thickest part of the soil and first discovered a hole. Continuing to dig down, they exposed the wall of the first chamber, but there was no tomb roof. From this kind of sign, it is speculated that the tomb has been robbed eight or nine times already. However, the purpose of tomb robbers is to obtain gold, silver, and treasures, while the purpose of archaeology is to seek its contributions, so even if the tomb has already been robbed, it still has value for excavation and research. The Gaoqiu where the tomb is located occupies an area of seven or eight acres, but judging from the size of the tomb chamber that has already been discovered, the tomb is definitely not seven or eight acres large. There may be several ancient tombs under Gaoqiu, or it may only be one tomb, currently discovered, on the edge. Under the ancient custom of elaborate burials, the tombs of ordinary people after death would have multiple doors and layers, so the tomb is most likely not the tomb of an emperor or duke. As for its era, the Three Kingdoms period of Sun Quan is still the most likely. Among the ancient coin patterns on the tomb bricks that have been discovered, the character "五" ("five") is relatively clear and upright, while the shapes of the other three characters are unprecedented. But upon closer observation, it can be seen that they are similar to the characters "大" ("big"), "泉" ("spring"), and "百" ("hundred"), which may have been the result of the artisans' impromptu changes when copying them at the time. Although there are three types of patterns on the bricks, no matter what, their earliest dynasty does not exceed the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, and the latest is limited to the Western Jin Dynasty. The excavation work of the tomb has not yet continued. Yang and Jiang contributed opinions on the excavation methods during their trip to Changzhou, so that the artifacts will not be damaged during the excavation and their documentary value will be preserved.</p>
<h3>Speaker and Senators Plead with Mayor to Stay; Mayor Sheds Tears, Stating Force Majeure; Not Out of Fear of Difficulty but Due to Ill Health Making It Difficult to Endure</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Senate believes that Mayor Wu has been meticulously planning and working diligently for the past three years, and has made outstanding achievements. Recently, due to health reasons, he submitted his resignation. However, at this time of turbulent situation, it is precisely when wise people are needed to continue their efforts. Yesterday, a tea party was specially held at the Senate to discuss retaining him. After the meeting, Speaker Pan and 44 senators went to the Municipal Government to meet Mayor Wu, conveying their sincere intention to retain him in person. Mayor Wu received them in the conference room of the Municipal Government. Speaker Pan first expressed the Senate's intention to console and retain him, hoping that the mayor could think of the city's six million citizens and dismiss the idea of resigning. Mayor Wu then stated that he had insisted on resigning this time due to physical exhaustion, which was truly a last resort. He felt ashamed and grateful for the high regard and kindness of the Senate colleagues, but hoped to gain their understanding. Yesterday, Mayor Wu was deeply moved by the senators' plea for him to stay, causing extreme emotional distress. Due to a momentary surge of emotion, he even burst into tears on the spot. He said: People are all emotional animals. For the past three years, I have been able to maintain the city's difficult situation thanks to the assistance of the senators. On the eve of my departure, I cannot bear the feeling of reluctance. Today, it is difficult for me to speak in front of you all, because I have no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>Three Major Problems Solved, Making It Easier for Successor</p>
<p>However, it must be stated that I am definitely not retreating due to difficulties. On the contrary, three major problems in the city have been resolved, which will make it easier for my successor and will not cause them difficulties: (1) Economic problems: The supply of US aid rice can be extended to the end of June. This was announced earlier, and now, after my efforts, other economic parts, such as cotton, flour, oil, and fertilizer, can also be extended to the end of June. This has provided considerable protection to industry and commerce, and the city's economy can be said to be temporarily free of problems. (2) Military discipline problems: Currently, the treatment of soldiers has been improved, and there is also a solution for non-staple food expenses. It is hoped that the burden on suburban residents can be reduced, and the city's security can be ensured. (3) Municipal government revenue and expenditure problems: Next month is the peak month for surcharges. As for the issue of increasing the salaries of municipal government employees, each person has now received an additional two dou of rice per month, and efforts are being made to continue the water and electricity subsidies to ensure that their minimum living standards can be maintained. Seeing all of this, I am definitely not leaving without taking responsibility, leaving the citizens with no explanation. Moreover, my illness has indeed been difficult to bear for the past two months, especially in recent days. It has been recurring almost every morning, affecting my work spirit. As for temporarily taking leave, it is definitely not a thorough solution, because I am inherently responsible in my work and must be completely free from it. It is also extremely difficult for the acting mayor to handle affairs. Therefore, after repeated consideration, I have decided to firmly resign. I am deeply grateful for everyone's good intentions, but I cannot accept them and can only swallow my tears. After Mayor Wu finished speaking, Senators Wang Xianqing and Jiang Huaishu stood up and spoke in succession, pleading with him to stay, saying that at this time of tense situation, the citizens cannot let Mayor Wu leave Shanghai and decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan to order him not to resign.</p>
<p>Mayor's Face Covered in Tears, Choking Unable to Speak</p>
<p>After hearing this, the mayor was at a loss, unable to cope, and looked quite nervous, saying in a discontinuous tone: I have already said what I needed to say, my body cannot do it, I cannot force it. Serving the public while sick is either destroying myself or delaying public affairs... At this point, the mayor's face was covered in tears, and he was choking, unable to speak. At that time, the entire room was silent. Speaker Pan then spoke, saying: It is a fact that the mayor's health is deteriorating, and it is also a fact that Shanghai needs Mayor Wu. For the sake of both public and private affairs, we can immediately request sick leave for him to recuperate, while also telegraphing the central government to retain him, and asking the mayor not to submit his resignation again from today. It is already very late today, so we can conclude here. After the meeting, the reporter asked Mayor Wu whether the senators' sincere plea to stay would lead the mayor to dismiss the idea of resigning. Wu shook his head and replied: I will still firmly resign, because my body does not permit it.</p>
<p>Unanimous Passing at Tea Party to Telegraph Executive Yuan to Retain Mayor</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Senate Tea Party was held yesterday afternoon at 3:40 PM in the Assembly Hall of the Senate, attended by Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and 56 senators. Speaker Pan chaired the meeting, first explaining the purpose of the tea party, which was to discuss how to retain the mayor. Mayor Wu's achievements in Shanghai are outstanding, and his sudden resignation has prompted people from all walks of life to sincerely plead with him to stay. I have repeatedly asked him to dismiss the idea of resigning, but he has not accepted. The current situation in Shanghai is becoming increasingly tense, and the mayor must not be allowed to resign. I hope that the Senate colleagues will exert their strength and sincerely request his retention. Deputy Speaker Xu and Senators Tang Shichang, Jin Runxiang, Jiang Huaishu, Chen Baotai, Fei Shusheng, Yu Shun, Zhao Yangxiong, Qu Yue, Wang Yansong, Zhu Wende, and others then spoke in succession, mostly expressing their intention to retain the mayor, and resolved that the Senate should ask the Executive Yuan to retain him, and after the meeting, they went to the Municipal Government to see Mayor Wu in person, conveying their sincere intention to retain him.</p>

<h3>US Consulate General Issues Statement Regarding Return of American Civilians and Families to Shanghai; Believes It Is Still Difficult to Say That the Emergency Has Passed</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, City Dispatch on the 25th] Regarding the return of evacuated American families to Shanghai, the US Consul General issued the following statement today:</p>
<p>The Consulate General has received numerous inquiries regarding the return of American families to Shanghai, requesting clarification of its position. Some of these inquiries have been made because a small number of families have already returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Although the current situation has temporarily entered a state of calm, the Consulate General believes it is still too early to say that the emergency has indeed passed. The fundamental reasons for issuing the evacuation warning in November remain unchanged. We certainly hope that Shanghai can avoid the accidents encountered by many regions of China in the tragic conflict, but this is still difficult to say. Regardless of the outcome of the peace talks, Americans in Shanghai may face various accidents and difficulties in the coming months. Under the current circumstances, it may not be unexpectedly dangerous to come to Shanghai temporarily from nearby safe areas. However, it is still too early to say that families—especially children—can safely return to this area. The situation of Americans who remain here for pressing reasons may become more difficult due to the return of families here.</p>
<p>The Consulate General firmly believes that Americans will give careful consideration to the above points before allowing their families to return. The responsibility for deciding on the return of families, as with the original evacuation efforts, still rests with the individuals and families involved. When the situation becomes sufficiently clear to permit families to return, the Consulate General will issue a clearer statement. Inquiries regarding family returns have been answered in accordance with the above opinion.</p>

<h3>Municipal Meeting Passes Opening of Non-Exclusive Public Utility Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Government held a municipal meeting yesterday, chaired by Mayor Wu, and resolved the following two items: (1) The prices of non-exclusive public utilities (such as taxi cabs, dock handling fees, barge freight rates, warehouse rentals, and dock berthing fees) were resolved to be completely opened, and monthly reports must still be submitted to the bureau for record.

<h3>Re-examination of Rent Standards; Plan Drafted by Councilors' Office Not Passed by Municipal Meeting</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The issue of rent standards in the city was discussed again at the Municipal Government meeting yesterday after being researched by the Councilors' Office, but it still did not pass. It is understood that the standard drafted by the Councilors' Office is still based on the three methods proposed by the Land Administration Bureau, and the city's houses are divided into six grades. The high or low rent standard is directly proportional to the quality of the house construction. In principle, the rent is still adjusted according to the multiple of the cost of living index, and the base number is discounted appropriately according to the pre-war rent. The size of the discount is inversely proportional to the original rent amount. For example, for a pre-war rent of 100 yuan, the current rent payable is 25 percent of the original amount multiplied by the current cost of living index. For pre-war rents lower than 100 yuan, it is 20 percent of the original amount multiplied by the current cost of living index. After the above method was presented for discussion at yesterday's municipal meeting, it was believed that if implemented, there would be many disputes between landlords and tenants in the future. Although there is a certain standard for the quality of houses, if the landlord and tenant cannot reach an agreement, they will inevitably ask the Land Administration Bureau to coordinate, and the Land Administration Bureau will be overwhelmed. Therefore, it was deemed necessary to re-examine it, and no concrete results were agreed upon yesterday. According to news from the Municipal Government Councilors' Office: Rent standards are related to all Shanghai citizens, and the Municipal Government will definitely formulate fair and reasonable methods, which will be discussed, decided, and announced in the next few days.</p>

<h3>The Yang Zhong-sheng Family Murder Case in Chuansha Shuyingfang Cracked; Five Heinous Robbers Who Murdered for Loot Will Be Sent to the Garrison Headquarters for Investigation and Punishment</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Zhong-sheng, 39 years old, from Chuansha, resided in Xiaoyingfang, Chuansha County. He previously opened the Shengli Hardware and Piano Store in Beijing, married two wives, one named Zhu and the other named Gu. He had a daughter named Rongfang, only five years old. At the end of last year, Yang took his family back to his hometown in Chuansha to live together. Unexpectedly, on the midnight of January 7th, the Yang residence was suddenly robbed. One robber climbed in from the roof into the kitchen, opened the door, and led three robbers into the bedroom in the west wing. At that time, Yang was sleeping with his wife and daughter. Hearing the sound, he woke up and was immediately tied up. The robbers then bound and strangled Yang's wife, concubine, and daughter, a total of four people, large and small, to death. Yang's concubine, Gu, was pregnant at the time, and the baby in her womb was also suffocated to death. Afterwards, the robbers looted everything and fled. It was not until the next morning that neighbors discovered the Yang family's tragedy and reported it to the Chuansha County Police Bureau. After investigation, there were no results until recently, when it was discovered that the group of robbers was hiding in the Shanghai West area. Officers were dispatched to Shanghai to cooperate with the Criminal Investigation Section of the Municipal Police Bureau and rushed to the Ji Jia Ku in Zhongshan Park, where they captured the suspects Shen Xusheng and Qin Jialu.

<h3>Deliberation on the Base Price of Hairdressing Reaches a Decision; Divided into Five Grades and Ten Levels, Calculated by Multiplying by the Cost of Living Index; Base Price for Bathhouses Still Undetermined</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The base prices for hairdressing and bathing, after being drafted by the two industry associations, were submitted to the Social Bureau for review. The Social Bureau convened the responsible persons of the two industry associations yesterday morning to study the matter. The base price for bathhouses could not be determined due to the soaring price of fuel.

The above base prices are doubled and then multiplied by the cost of living index. Taking the cost of living index of 1339.36 times on the 15th of this month as an example, the Special First Grade price is 4553.824 yuan, the Special Second Grade price is 3482.336 yuan, the Grade A First Grade price is 2678.72 yuan, the Grade A Second Grade price is 2142.976 yuan, the Grade B First Grade price is 1741.1868 yuan, the Grade B Second Grade price is 1473.296 yuan, the Grade C First Grade price is 1205.424 yuan, the Grade C Second Grade price is 937.552 yuan, the Grade D First Grade price is 669.68 yuan, and the Grade D Second Grade price is 401.8 yuan.

In the future, the prices for the hairdressing industry for each of the four weeks of the month will be adjusted according to the above formula.

<h3>Police and Robbers Fight Fiercely on Hartung Road; Owner of Shirt Factory Robbed at Home; Patrol Officer Almost Suffers Fatal Attack; Three Criminals Captured Successively, Weapons Seized</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] No. 35, Lane 240, Tongren Road (i.e., Hartung Road), is the residence of Shui Mingde, the owner of the Shuimeida Shirt Factory. At about 8:30 PM the night before, seven robbers suddenly arrived, all carrying weapons such as Mauser pistols and automatic rifles, threatening the female owner, Shui Fan Yueying, and others, and arbitrarily looting. They were robbed of two diamond rings, six US dollars, one gold thread ring, and 15,000 yuan in cash. At that time, the victim Shui Mingde took the opportunity to jump over the wall and ran to a neighbor to borrow a telephone to report to the Jing'an Temple Police Branch. Wang Huachen and Yan Xianghu, the chief and deputy chiefs of the branch, ordered Yu Ding, the chief of the criminal section, to lead patrol officer Meng Ruisheng, police officers Yang Zhenzhong, Zheng Wangwen, Lu Changjiang, Xia Yongchao, Chen Jue, and others to rush to the scene in a police car. Meng Ruisheng bravely broke through the door first. At that time, the robbers were rushing out from the darkness. Meng immediately ordered them to stop and raise their hands. Unexpectedly, the robbers aimed their automatic rifles at his head and fired three shots. Fortunately, Meng was alert and immediately fell to the ground to dodge. The robbers fled past him in different directions, and Meng also drew his gun and fired three shots in return, but none of them hit. Two robbers at the rear turned back and ran into Lane 250. Patrol officer Meng led police officer Xia Yongchao to pursue them. When they reached West Beijing Road, because there were many passengers near the tram station, the two robbers escaped into the crowd. Two other robbers turned from Tongren Road to Nanyang Road. Police officers Yang Zhenzhong and Lu Changjiang pursued them closely. The robbers opened fire with their Mauser pistols to resist arrest, and the police also fired many shots, but none of them hit. The police and robbers exchanged fire more than 20 times. When two robbers turned from Nanyang Road to West Kangding Road, one of them secretly discarded a revolver with four bullets next to a pancake stall. Police officer Yang saw that he had no weapons in his hand and rushed forward, capturing him. He recovered the firearms, bullets, and other items, and took him to the station for interrogation. According to his confession, his name was Chen Hengbiao. A gold ring was also found in his sock. Based on his confession, the investigating police officer led the suspect to Wuzhen Road and other places and arrested two accomplices, Li Wu and Dai Youshan, that night, and seized two pistols. The fleeing robbers are currently being pursued.</p>

<h3>The North China Trade in the Eyes of Hong Kong Merchants: Taking Hope, Bringing Back Disappointment</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zi Jian</p>
<p>[Hong Kong, 22nd (Shipping Report from Our Newspaper)] The first ship returning from the Communist-controlled area of North China arrived in Hong Kong yesterday. Over the past two or three weeks, ships, one after another, have carried goods and the boundless hopes of Hong Kong merchants to North China. During this period, the Chinese Communists promulgated the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Foreign Trade," which further excited the Hong Kong merchants, who were focused on "business for business' sake." However, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. The "facts" brought back by the "Shanghuali" cargo ship yesterday caused the Hong Kong merchants to be suddenly lost. Everyone couldn't help but turn pessimistic and filled with emotion about this business!</p>
<p>The goods carried by the Huawali to Tianjin included ten boxes of saccharin, about 1,000 pounds, 100 tons of rubber, and 200 dan of Yuanqing sulfide. Based on Hong Kong market prices, Hong Kong merchants were confident that they could exchange them for 3,000 pieces of peanuts. However, they only exchanged them for 100 pieces of peanuts and more than 700 pieces of other mountain products (including walnuts, apricot kernels, chestnuts, melon seeds, and other Beijing candied fruits) and medicinal materials. It was truly like a bucket of cold water poured over them, and losing a lot of money was the least of their worries.</p>
<p>Now, Hong Kong merchants have suddenly realized that the Chinese Communists, who tout a "policy of protecting industry and commerce," have a set of methods that seem even more severe than the government's previous trade controls! The Chinese Communists have either listed goods that ordinary merchants "dream of" as monopoly products (such as peanuts, soybeans, pig bristles, oils, and coal) or prohibited their export (such as grain, bean cake, and raw cotton), and the only things they allow to be freely exchanged are mountain products and medicinal materials with limited sales. The only things welcomed by the Chinese Communists are military supplies and machinery. As for industrial raw materials, cotton cloth, grain, etc., although they can be imported, they are subject to discrimination and cannot be exchanged for valuable goods. Hong Kong merchants are beginning to see the authority of the Chinese Communist's "Trade Bureau."</p>
<p>It is said that the import tax levied by the Chinese Communists is the same as the government's previous tax rate. Exported mountain products and medicinal materials are taxed at 5%. In order to pay taxes and apply for barter, goods must undergo two appraisals: one by customs and one by the trade bureau. The two appraisals differ from each other and from local prices. Hong Kong merchants have left a deep impression on the "lack of experience and ability" of the Chinese Communist appraisers and expressed great disappointment. The "valuable lessons" brought back by the Huawali have caused Hong Kong merchants to finally question the policies of the Chinese Communists and have a new understanding of the true face of the Chinese Communists.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government announced yesterday the trade figures with China for February, with imports valued at 34,008,132 Hong Kong dollars, of which South China accounted for 23,330,435 dollars, North China accounted for 8,284,214 dollars, and Central China accounted for 2,393,483 dollars. Exports were valued at 23,029,271 dollars, of which South China accounted for 11,778,941 dollars, North China accounted for 7,915,269 dollars, and Central China accounted for 3,335,061 dollars. (In the eyes of the Hong Kong government, there is only one government in China, with no distinction between the Nationalist and Communist governments. North China is part of China, so trade between Hong Kong and North China is still considered trade with China and not trade with the Communist area.) It can be seen from this that in February alone, trade between North China and Hong Kong reached more than 16 million yuan, even more than Central China. These figures reveal a big secret: in addition to Hong Kong merchants, the Chinese Communists or those related to them are also doing a lot of business with North China in Hong Kong. They hire special ships to transport urgently needed materials to North China in batches and also transport raw materials from North China to Hong Kong in batches. One merchant said angrily: "Now I understand the economic policies of the Chinese Communists. They only allow themselves to make money on profitable businesses and monopolize high-profit goods. They only know that there is a Trade Bureau and do not know that there are merchants. The policies of the Nationalist Party in the past were not so selfish and arbitrary!"</p>
<p>According to automobile merchants, the Hong Kong market is now lacking trucks. Whether new or old, they have all been bought up by people related to the Chinese Communists. As a result, automobile parts, tires, and gasoline are also in short supply. The transportation of printing paper to North China has also made rapid progress recently. According to relevant sources, in this month alone, the amount of imported book paper to North China is already 500 tons. Including roll paper, copy paper, kraft paper, etc., the total is at least over 1,000 tons. Due to the actual needs, trade between Linjiang and North China will continue to increase in the future, but for merchants who are focused on "business for business' sake," they will have to "change course" or "look at it differently."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Seventeenth Dispatch] Whether Jishi Mountain (Amne Machin) is the world's highest peak has been a mystery since last year when Central Air Transport Deputy Manager Chen Wenkuan flew in a special plane to explore it, proving it was a lie by the conman Reynaud. Later, as time passed, Jishi Mountain gradually faded from people's minds. Recently, someone brought up the old story again: An American explorer named Clark, went via Beiping, Baotou, Ningxia to Lanzhou, accompanied by a professor from Fu Jen Catholic University. After arriving in Lanzhou, they visited Lu Shounan, the curator of the National Science Education Hall, expressing great interest in Jishi Mountain and wanting to visit it by land; because he had read an article written by Reynaud about Jishi Mountain in an American magazine, which described Jishi Mountain as still being the world's highest peak. This trip to the Northwest is especially to explore its height to clarify the situation and appreciate the scenery of Jishi Mountain in the snow and ice. Clark also loves hunting and hopes to hunt rare birds and animals in Jishi Mountain. After obtaining the consent of the Qinghai Provincial Authorities, they set off immediately and will return to Lanzhou in two or three months.</p>
<p>Fleeing to Lanzhou to talk about the ancient city of Beiping.</p>
<p>Since the success of the Beiping peace talks, many public officials and university students who had disguised themselves and fled have come via Baotou, Ningxia, or northern Shaanxi. Wang Dehou, the mayor of Zhangjiakou, and his advisor Gao Yutian, Gao Jinlan, the major general and deputy commander of the Beiping Self-Defense Force, and Dong Bosheng, as well as a dozen or so university students, have all arrived in Lanzhou one after another. According to them, they took a train from Beiping to Zhangjiakou, a car to Pingdiquan, and then a train to Zhuozishan. This is a vacuum zone, and the Chinese Communists check very strictly at each station. Because they were disguised as legitimate merchants and carried proper documents, they were not hindered along the way. After walking from Zhuozishan to Suiyuan, they took a train to Baotou, then went to Ningxia and arrived here. It is said that students who fled from Yenching University, Peking University, and Normal University are constantly on the road, and many are stranded in Ningxia. When they talked about the recent situation in Beiping, they said that after the Communist army entered Beiping, order had not been restored, and the economy and finance were particularly chaotic. People's currency, local circulating coupons, and many small notes were used at the same time, and inflation was abnormally high. The Communist army registered people's property. It is rumored that some of Fu Zuoyi's cadres have committed suicide, such as Guo, the commander of the 35th Army, and some have fled in disguise, such as An Chunshan, the commander of the Provisional 3rd Army. Captain Gao Jinlan said that he had seen Wu Yuzhang's so-called Nanjing People's Peace Delegation. The Communist Party has about three rules for the news media in the "liberated" ancient capital: (1) Publish more news from the New China News Agency. (2) Incorrect news is not allowed to be published. (3) Manuscripts must be approved before they can be published. Afterwards, the newspapers rarely had "Our Newspaper News" and became a uniform "New China News Agency News." A Normal University student, Li Yanxia, ​​said with a smile: "There are many jokes in Beiping. After the Chinese Communist army entered Beiping, the excessive luxury of the city really made the Communist army feel like 'Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden,' with a feeling of being 'overwhelmed by favor.'"</p>
<p>Six "Convair" planes ordered from the United States will arrive in Lanzhou.</p>
<p>According to Zhao Wenbin, director of the Lanzhou office of Central Air Transport, six new "Convair" passenger planes ordered by the company in the United States have flown from the United States via Europe and will arrive in the next few days. The "Convair," also known as the "Flying Palace," is most suitable for long-distance flights. For example, if an ordinary passenger plane flies from Shanghai to Dihua, it takes four days for a round trip. If the "Convair" type plane flies, it can reach Dihua in one day, so this type of plane is very likely to join this longest domestic route in the future. The "Convair" type plane can carry 40 passengers and has eight characteristics: (1) The cabin is equipped with an automatic temperature regulator, so you don't have to suffer from the cold or heat. (2) The flying speed is 300 miles per hour, which is faster than any current passenger plane. (3) The engine horsepower is very strong, and the take-off and landing are easy. (4) There is a pressure regulator in the plane, so passengers do not feel dizzy or tired. (5) The wings are equipped with heating equipment, and ice and snow will melt immediately on the wings, without any real icing. (6) The observation holes are quite large, so passengers can enjoy the scenery. (8) The refueling is simple and quick, and there is double insurance in the cabin, and the safety equipment is complete.</p>
<p>The calligrapher Zhao Wangyun disappeared in Xi'an.</p>
<p>According to news from Xi'an, Zhao Wangyun, a famous painter known for drawing from life, was suddenly kidnapped around 8 pm on the 7th of this month, and his whereabouts are unknown. Note: Mr. Zhao came to Lanzhou last year to exhibit his works and went to Xinjiang to draw from life at the invitation of General Zhang Wenbai, with great success. Friends in Lanzhou were very concerned when they heard the news.</p>
<p>A two-foot-long horseshoe crab is on display in Landu.</p>
<p>Aquatic animals are very rare in the Northwest. Recently, someone brought a horseshoe crab from the south, more than two feet long and nearly one foot wide, which is unusually large. It has been made into a specimen and presented to Chairman Guo Jijiao. Mr. Guo considered this object to be quite rare and specially sent it to the National Gansu Science Education Hall, where it will be open to the public for exhibition in the next few days.</p>
<p>There are many obstacles to investigating wealthy households in Gansu.</p>
<p>In October, the Gansu Provincial Government ordered the counties and cities to start investigating people's wealth. The highest standard for "special wealthy households" is real estate or movable property worth 50,000 silver coins. It has been almost half a year, and the counties have encountered many obstacles. As of recently, only a few counties and bureaus, such as Xiahe, Subei, Zhuoni, Huichuan, and Hezheng, have reported to the province. More than 60 other counties have no information at all. According to reports from several counties and bureaus, there are four or five households in Xiahe County, and only two or three households in the two administrative bureaus of Subei and Zhuoni. Huichuan, a large county, does not even have wealthy households that meet the fifth-class standard (with movable or immovable property worth 10,000 silver coins). No one would believe this kind of report, but the Huichuan County Council even sent a letter to the provincial government to confirm it. Therefore, the provincial government yesterday ordered the county to stop making excuses and conduct a thorough investigation. These facts prove that the future of the renovation movement is indeed a bit difficult.</p>

<h3>The Reader Scholarship of Shen Bao for the Spring of the 38th Year of the Republic of China has been successfully completed.</h3>
<p>Six points on assisted students, handling of aid funds, submission of academic works, and statements.</p>
<p>The list of approved junior high, high school, university and college students for the Spring Semester of the 38th year of the Reader Scholarship of this newspaper, has been published in this column from the 12th to the 16th of this month, and the aid funds have also been fully distributed. At the end of this period, we would like to report a few points to the readers: (1) Recently, eleven late applications, including Wang Chengwei's second batch of applications, could not be processed, but considering the student's poverty and excellence, and because of the school's signature procedures and other reasons, they could not be completed on time, so a special exception was made. However, the amount of aid can only remain the same, and the students will be responsible for the losses caused by the devaluation of the currency, to show fairness. (2) This newspaper stipulates that those who receive aid from other places shall not receive aid from this newspaper. If there is such a situation, it must be returned voluntarily within this month. Once found out after the deadline, or reported by other readers, in addition to recovering the principal and interest of the aid, the name and school of study will be published in the newspaper as a warning. (3) Schools should not recommend students who have already been granted free tuition within their stipulated free quota; however, it has recently been found that some schools have violated this regulation and collected the aid funds of the assisted students on behalf of them, thereby reducing the burden of free tuition, which is very regrettable! We hope that the authorities of these schools will still return the aid funds automatically, otherwise this newspaper will announce it when necessary. (4) The donations for this session were used to purchase and store rice at any time, so although prices have soared, the aid received by the students has been less affected. The purchased rice and jewelry gold must be settled in total in order to average the amount of money that more than 300 university and college students should receive, so they were all sold at market prices on the 9th of this month. (The detailed accounts have been published yesterday). (5) At that time, St. John's University and Shanghai University sent letters stating that due to winter vacation and holidays, they gave up the 16 aid quotas they should have received, and several other people who voluntarily gave up or resubmitted their applications, so the 26 shi of rice donated under the Chifeng aid project were not sold, and the physical objects were kept by the scholarship committee for the next aid session. (6) All students who received aid this session must submit theses, vocabularies, or the most insightful academic works before the summer vacation, in order to show their gratitude to the enthusiastic donors, and the joint submission method will be announced in two months. The specially approved list of second batches is now published as follows:</p>
<p>(Shanghai Law School) Wang Chengwei, (China New College) Shi Pinquan, (China Industrial and Commercial) Jia Zhenzhong, (Guanghua High School Attached) Yan Lanyu, Lao Guoying, (Daren Middle School) Wang Ziji, Zhao Zhizhong, (Minli Middle School) Xu Jiyu, (Chuneng Middle School) Lin Yimin, (Guanghua High School Attached) Yue Changnian, (Chuneng Middle School) Xu Zhiying.</p>

<h3>The Guilin Provincial Council Firmly Supports Opening Wuzhou</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Liang Yushan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guilin Seventeenth Dispatch] The port of Wuzhou is the lifeline of Guangxi Province, and the province unanimously calls on the government to implement its opening immediately. The reasons are: (1) In terms of transportation, the Sui-Wu route is 418 kilometers, and the Hong Kong-Wu route is 432 kilometers. When Wuzhou had customs, exports could go directly to Hong Kong and Macau, taking only two or three days. After the Wuzhou Customs was reorganized, exports had to be detoured through Guangzhou, Jiangmen, and other places, extending the journey to a week, increasing freight and cost, and causing merchants to suffer losses, and goods cannot flow smoothly. (2) In terms of finance, there are many advantages in foreign exchange settlement after Wuzhou is opened. Because Wuzhou is not opened, the Central Bank does not set up a foreign exchange agency here, and all foreign exchange settlement matters for imports and exports from Wuzhou are handled by other banks on behalf of them, and then transferred to the Shanghai Central Bank for collection, which invisibly increases the burden on exporters due to the different values of Hong Kong exchange rates and the loss of transfer fees and time. (3) Loss of foreign exchange. Guangdong has many rivers and is prone to smuggling. Materials transferred from the Wuzhou River to Guangdong may not be able to settle foreign exchange in accordance with regulations, resulting in a huge loss of national foreign exchange. The number of exports from Wuzhou is quite large. If it is stipulated that all export materials from Wuzhou must be settled and exported here, it is expected that the income of the family will increase.</p>
<p>The Guilin Provincial Council is now strongly advocating the speedy restoration of the Wuzhou Customs. The 23rd Standing Committee of the Council also discussed this issue and believes that opening Wuzhou as a foreign port, so that native products from Guizhou, Yunnan, and other places, as well as foreign goods from Hong Kong and Macau, can directly enter and exit from Wuzhou, will be of great benefit to the national economy and people's livelihood. Unequal treaties have long been abolished, and tax autonomy is not comparable to the forced signing of treaties to open commercial ports by the decadent Qing Dynasty. Internal river navigation rights are where national sovereignty lies, and the government can carefully consider them. Therefore, it is believed that opening Wuzhou to foreign trade can facilitate merchants and people, promote the prosperity of the inland economy, and promote production, which is consistent with the significance of setting up customs in Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places.</p>
<p>After Wuzhou is opened, transit taxes and freight costs will be reduced. In terms of exports, the reduction in costs can increase the quantity of native products for export, which will naturally be beneficial to the prosperity of commerce and the development of the economy. In terms of imports, the reduction in costs will invisibly enhance consumers' purchasing power. However, because of this, the inland handicrafts and shipping industries will also have problems. How to increase production, stabilize the economy, and control navigation rights is really worth studying.</p>

<h3>New Finance Minister Liu Gongyun Answers Reporters' Questions: Financial Reform is Under Discussion; Last Night's Reception for the Financial Community was Said to be Ordinary Entertainment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The newly appointed Minister of Finance, Liu Gongyun, completed his official duties in Nanjing yesterday and flew back to Shanghai by plane at half past four in the afternoon. Mr. Liu went directly to the Central Bank office at the starting point by car at about five o'clock. Fearing that a group of reporters would gather for a collective interview, Mr. Liu first declared to the outside world through the News Liaison Committee of the bank: Although he has been appointed as Minister of Finance by the He Cabinet, he has not yet officially taken office. Therefore, all statements made in the position of Minister of Finance must be announced after taking office.</p>
<p>However, the group of reporters still submitted many written questions, requesting Mr. Liu to answer them. The following are the questions and answers that Mr. Liu has answered: (1) Are there any new supplementary measures for the new financial reform plan? Answer: It is currently under discussion. (2) Is there any new reform of the current monetary system? Is it true that silver dollar notes will be issued? He did not answer the first half of the question, but said that the issuance of silver dollar notes is absolutely not true. (3) Will there be any changes to the existing import and export control policies? Answer: It is being discussed with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (4) When can the cash shortage be effectively resolved, and are there any concrete solutions? Answer: We are currently trying to gradually improve it. (5) Will silver dollars be sold in the gold market? Answer: The use of silver dollars will be handled at any time as appropriate.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu did not give any answers to other questions regarding silver loans, the new candidates for the political and permanent vice ministers of the Ministry of Finance, the deputy governor of the National Bank, and the attitude of the Ministry of Finance towards the north-south money transfer.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Liu hosted a banquet for the leaders of the financial community in the city on the fourth floor of the Bank of China at 7:00 p.m. last night. Although Mr. Liu told reporters yesterday that the invitation was just ordinary entertainment, it is generally believed that after Mr. Liu takes office as Minister of Finance, he will have a new set of more mobile and more effective new methods to address the various realistic problems after the implementation of the current new financial reform plan, in order to supplement the shortcomings of the old plan. Judging from Mr. Liu's answer to the first question from reporters yesterday, it is sufficient to prove that Mr. Liu not only has the determination to formulate supplementary measures, but is already under discussion. However, Mr. Liu, as the newly appointed Minister of Finance, in order to express the desire to gather ideas and benefits, specially listened to the opinions of the leaders of the financial community in the city again in order to win the cooperation of the financial community and facilitate the implementation of the new supplementary measures.</p>
<h3>The National Bank did not sell gold yesterday, and the market was brisk and profitable.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The gold market trend was stable in the morning yesterday and soared in the afternoon. In the early morning, because the money supply was still abundant, it was rumored that after the National Bank continued to put a lot of pressure on the market, it had the intention to temporarily stop yesterday. Moreover, the overnight banks had a huge difference, and the industry predicted that it would not be possible to tighten it temporarily, so the trend was strong, and the intention to absorb the surface was also strong. The morning opened with a firm tone, and the initial call was to buy at 6.05 million, but no one responded to sell, and there was no transaction. In an instant, the call rose to 6.12 million before a transaction was made. Large households sold at high prices, and the market calmed down slightly, falling to 6.11 million. However, idle funds outside the industry continued to attack, and the trend outside the market was already higher than the call in the market. Therefore, the brokers raised the price, and there were many who paid the price. The market rose directly to 6.19 million. The trend was firm all the way in the middle, and there was no sign of fatigue. At about 11 o'clock, fearing that the National Bank would exert pressure again, the psychology of floating more tended to soften, and the short side was active. The intention to get out of the market was strong inside and outside the market, and the market took small steps, falling to 6.12 million and 6.13 million. Afterwards, no sales were seen, the market turned stable, and the new shorts were replenished, and the call price rose again, finally closing at 6,145,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, following the brisk trend of the previous market, the money supply was still loose, and large households absorbed secretly, and the market saw another brisk rise. The initial opening was 6.18 million, and it rose all the way to 6.25 million, closing late. The midday closing price outside the market in the morning was 6.12 million, 6.15 million, and the late closing price in the afternoon was 6.18 million, 6.21 million. In addition, the spot position was settled the next day, with an interest rate of 290,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The US sales bill opened at 12,700 yuan, 12,800 yuan in the morning and closed at 12,300 yuan, 12,400 yuan. The afternoon opened at 12,400 yuan, 12,500 yuan. The late closing was 12,500 yuan, 12,600 yuan. Interest will be added to the next day's position.</p>
<h3>The gold sale fraud is not a fact.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday's report said that another fraud case occurred in the gold sale work presided over by the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. According to a statement from the spokesman of the bank: The bank's gold sale has accounts to be checked, and the reports are not factual. The bank will also send a letter to the newspaper that published the news to correct it.</p>
<h3>Money supply is loose.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday's money supply continued to be loose and flat. The morning opening continued the loose trend of the previous day. The daily dismantling was about 50 to 60 yuan, and there were still many supply orders inside and outside the industry. Fortunately, the disbursement of the national treasury and remittances from other ports often arrive, and fortunately, there is a yarn settlement of about 3 billion the next day, which has a mutual offset effect. In turn, the various industries were cautious about dismantling orders due to the approaching weekend, and the money supply once showed a stabilizing trend, but the national banks continued to dispatch 4 billion yuan in the afternoon, so the supply of spot funds was still loose and flat. The daily dismantling was finally around 50 yuan.</p>
<p>The National Banks continued to dispatch more than 4 billion yuan yesterday, the large exchange banks dispatched more than 1.1 billion yuan, the foreign merchant banks dispatched about 900 million yuan, and the small exchange banks dispatched about 2 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Small remittances to Beiping continued to be opened yesterday.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] North-south money transfer, Xinhua and China Industrial and Commercial Banks still opened small amounts yesterday, the situation is similar to the previous day. The amount of funds that each bank counter can accept for remittance depends on how much spot funds are available for payment in Beiping. Therefore, although there are many applicants for remittance, the banks remitting are unable to accept large amounts for the time being due to the problem of settlement capacity in Beiping. South remittances to the north are also limited to small household remittances. As for large commercial remittances, it remains to be seen when they will be opened. Other transshipment banks such as Shanghai, Jin Cheng, and Jianye were also heard to have transactions yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Central Bank has telegraphed and ordered to purchase foreign exchange certificates in Wuzhou.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to the Import and Export Control Commission, since the government decided to open Wuzhou as a foreign port, the export merchants there believe that the Wuzhou branch of the Central Bank has not yet opened the foreign exchange transfer certificate purchase business, which has greatly affected the price of transfer certificates in the area, which will hinder the exports in the area in the future. The two Import and Export Control Commissions have contacted the Central Bank to handle this purchase business in Wuzhou. The Commission believes that this move is indeed necessary and has forwarded a letter to the Central Bank for consultation, and has obtained the intention to purchase. It is heard that the Business Bureau of the Bank has telegraphed and ordered the Wuzhou branch to handle it accordingly.</p>
<h3>The Central Bank will set up a Gold and Silver Business Section.</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the gold and silver market, the Central Bank believes that the business will expand, and it is necessary to establish a special management agency to be responsible for all matters. It is reported that the Gold and Silver Business Section will be established immediately, and Zhou Shunxin, the deputy director of the Business Bureau, will be appointed.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Rice Prices Stabilize, Cooking Oil Experiences a Sharp Price Increase, Miscellaneous Grains Fluctuate, Flour Slowly Rises</h3>
<p>Rice prices in the southern market rose, while rice prices in the northern market remained stable. Because the southern market price was lower than the northern market price the previous day, suppliers raised prices. Coupled with continued loose credit and rising prices in Wuxi, prices increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan immediately after the market opened. Later, due to poor actual sales demand, prices slightly declined. White japonica rice was 65,000 yuan, and thin indica rice was 66,000 yuan, each rising by 2,000 yuan. There were no price changes in the northern market, remaining the same as yesterday. Total arrivals in the two markets were 5,999 shi (石, a unit of dry measure).</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: Yesterday, another sharp price increase occurred due to scarce supply and suppliers hoarding goods. Under speculative manipulation, soybean oil reached a high of 350,000 yuan. Prices slightly declined at the close, but ultimately rose by 15%. Raw oil exceeded the 400,000 yuan mark, rising by 35,000 yuan. Raw bulk oil and other types all increased by 20,000 yuan, and soybean cake also rose by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour: Slowly rising. The market opened in the morning with easy credit and smooth actual sales. Old "Car" and "Warship" brands all rose by 1,000 yuan. Later, upon hearing that gold prices had fallen, market sentiment weakened. Old "Car" brand retreated to 24,700 yuan, and "Warship" brand retreated to 23,680 yuan, still increasing by 600 to 700 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Prices were mixed. Due to loose credit and strong actual sales, and with oil cake prices surging, suppliers were pushing prices up vigorously for soybeans. "Car" soybeans rose by 10%, and the asking price for the afternoon market exceeded 60,000 yuan. Raw Sichuan and newly arrived goods remained sluggish, with slow sales, falling by 10,000 yuan. Sesame, with a large quantity awaiting delivery, saw prices rise by 10%. Red sorghum rose slightly, and corn prices initially increased and then declined, with the market ultimately closing flat.</p>
<h3>Strong Selling Pressure in the Stock Market Forces Continued Decline in Chinese Shares</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Chinese stock market continued to weaken yesterday. Various foreign goods remained stagnant, and business sentiment lacked any stimulus. Since the Central Bank began selling gold, the price trends of a range of goods have been uncertain, greatly reducing speculative psychology, which has had a particularly severe impact on the stock market. Consequently, speculative funds have shifted to interbank lending. Moreover, yesterday being Friday, the double burden of interest on old positions further intensified selling pressure. Yong Xin Yarn opened at 7.25 yuan. Short sellers took profits, pushing the price up to 7.36 yuan, the highest point of the entire trading session after the opening. Later, upon hearing that credit conditions remained loose, some parties attempted to push prices up. However, the bulls felt deeply scarred by consecutive declines, and their ambition had waned. Therefore, short sellers became active in the market. Gold merchants and securities firms also began selling, plunging the market into a sluggish state, breaking the 7 yuan level and reaching a low of 6.94 yuan. Near the close, upon hearing that the Central Bank was selling gold, some floating short positions were covered, pushing the price up to 7.10 yuan. Ultimately, short sellers released more positions, and the market outlook remained hopeless, closing near noon at 6.95 yuan. Small and medium-sized stocks were uniformly weak. All stocks opened at lower prices. Xinhe fell from 2.20 yuan to close at 2.00 yuan. Xinguang fell from 0.775 yuan to close at 0.675 yuan. Meiya fell from 2.20 yuan to 2.03 yuan. Jingfuqin and Jinglun both closed at lower prices. Taiwan Sugar opened lower but closed higher, maintaining a strong trend. Huafeng opened and closed at average levels, with little change. The remaining miscellaneous brands all fell across the board. Total trading volume for the day was 4,189,665 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Shares Show Slight Gains</h3>
<p>The foreign stock market showed slight gains. Institutional investors, seeing that credit conditions were still loose, showed some interest in window dressing. However, floating short-term investors sold on the highs. Near the close, signs of weakness reappeared. Yisha traded at 15,500 yuan to 15,700 yuan, up 300 yuan. British Union traded at 21,000 yuan, uniquely rising by 1,000 yuan. Yeguang had offers at 6,500 yuan, but no transactions were reported. Asia traded at 1,530 yuan to 1,560 yuan, up 300 yuan. Jardine Matheson traded at 65,000 yuan to 67,000 yuan, surging up 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The gold and government bond market remained stable. The market opened at 390,000 yuan, rising all the way to 450,000 yuan, and closed at noon at 400,000 yuan. The afternoon market initially traded at 390,000 yuan, and later remained at 400,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Extension of Check Clearing Time; Financial Management Bureau Has Ascertained Responsibility</h3>
<p>Regarding the illegal extension of check clearing time by the check clearinghouse in recent days, after thorough investigation by the Financial Management Bureau, the issue of responsibility has been reported to the Ministry of Finance for appropriate action. According to reporters, the responsibility can be pursued in two aspects: (1) The check clearinghouse's unauthorized extension of the prescribed check clearing time is illegal. The manager of the clearinghouse, Cao Jiru, should bear considerable responsibility. Furthermore, whether there are other instances of corruption needs to be further investigated. (2) Banks and financial institutions are required to submit checks for clearing to the clearinghouse by 1:00 PM every day. However, in reality, banks and financial institutions often delay until 4:00 PM or later to submit checks, which hinders the clearing process. The respective banks and financial institutions should also bear considerable responsibility.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>The raw silk market was flat and soft yesterday. Prices of external goods were stable. Interbank lending was prevalent. Short-term investors frequently liquidated positions. Bullish sentiment decreased. Sales in the local market were sluggish. Speculative trading appeared particularly dull. No. 120 Guangxin new goods opened in the morning at 2.6 million yuan, immediately declining to 2.57 million yuan. There was no improvement at the noon close, still ending at 2.57 million yuan. Next-day settlement was 2.68 million yuan.</p>
<p>Raw silk market sentiment has weakened as gold and currency price surges have been halted. Although credit conditions were loose, purchasing demand was not strong. There were fewer external hoarders. High-grade Lingdan initially traded at 3.85 million yuan, then declined slightly to 3.7 million yuan. D-grade 78-uniformity white silk initially traded at 2.82 million yuan, then also retreated slightly to 3.71 million yuan.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market was flat and soft. Purchasing demand was moderate. Trading in the market was increasingly quiet. Market sentiment was very weak. Dacheng opened in the morning at 1.87 million yuan, rising slightly to 1.88 million yuan. After the high, many short positions were released, falling to 1.84 million yuan. The trade recovered by 5,000 yuan, and Meiya closed at noon at 1.85 million yuan.</p>
<h3>New Longjing Tea Prices Fall</h3>
<p>This year's Wenzhou new Longjing tea, since its arrival in the market some days ago, had further arrivals in Shanghai yesterday, totaling about 40-odd catties. Although the arrival quantity increased compared to before, at present it is still considered news teas, hence lacking substantial shipment volume. It is generally expected that it may gradually pick up starting next week. As for prices, they have moved in the opposite direction of the arrivals, steadily declining. It is heard that colleagues are offering prices around 8,000 yuan per catty, a decrease of 2,000 yuan compared to before. The reason for this is that the initial batches to market were newly sprouted buds, and scarcity made them expensive, driving prices up. Subsequently, as more goods arrived, the quality was slightly inferior to the earlier ones, and market sentiment ultimately declined. According to this situation, further declines are expected in the future, but the trend will be softly weak and strongly firm.</p>
<p>Also, according to people in the trade, this year, due to weather conditions, rainfall was not evenly distributed, resulting in harvests and output of new tea in various regions that were lower than in previous years. As for the color of aged tea, in the market yesterday, with stable external material prices, it also eased along with the trend, with prices almost on par with the previous day.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Price Increases Halted</h3>
<p>Following a series of frantic surges, the tung oil trend in the market yesterday, although speculative positions were still abundant, actual sales were extremely narrow, buyers showed no interest, and external goods generally turned flat. As a result, colleagues' thinking stabilized, and the rising trend was suddenly blocked. As a result, white and red tung oil both maintained their original levels, as did light green oil.</p>
<h3>Prolonged Drought in Taiwan Affects Taiwan Sugar Production</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The prolonged drought in Taiwan has significantly reduced water resources, threatening the power generation capacity of the Sun Moon Lake power plant. There is concern among some that the production of Taiwan Sugar, which the nation relies on for export, may be affected. According to economic observers who recently returned to Shanghai from Taiwan, the province has not had rain since the end of last year. With the exception of the eastern part of the province, there is a widespread water shortage in the north, south, west, and central regions. The water storage in the Sun Moon Lake reservoir is low, and electricity conservation measures have been implemented, stipulating that factories with less than 1,000 kilowatts are only supplied with four and a half hours of electricity per day (starting after 6:00 PM). Residential electricity use is also restricted. If this situation continues, agriculture and industry will suffer severely. Fortunately, the total production of Taiwan Sugar has reached over 400,000 tons to date. Medium-grained sugar accounts for the largest portion of the products. If it rains and electricity is sufficient, factories in Tainan and Pingtung can harvest another 96,000-plus tons by mid-May. Then, before the end of the sugar production season, approximately 600,000 tons will be harvested in total, exceeding the estimated 500,000 tons. Regarding exports, Taiwan Sugar is very active in the international market. As of mid-May, Japan has ordered 100,000 tons, and the United Kingdom has ordered 50,000 tons, significantly enriching the national treasury. As for the reasons for strong sales abroad, the cost is lower, which is due to the economic stability of Taiwan, low wages, and no labor unrest. According to world-renowned sugar factories, employee salaries account for about one-third of the output. Currently, the monthly expenses for Taiwan Sugar employees are only equivalent to 2,500 tons of sugar, a difference that cannot be overstated. Also, such as the restrictions on remittances between Taiwan and Shanghai, which results in low employee compensation, and treatment that is sometimes unreliable, the authorities are strongly encouraged to improve this as much as possible. Finally, the observer stated that Taiwan Sugar factories have been working hard towards increased production since their takeover, and the results have been remarkable. Currently, it has approximately 25,000 employees and cane farmers, and approximately one million people rely on it directly and indirectly for their livelihoods. The annual replenishment of factory equipment, supply of fertilizers, and use of working capital are all provided by the Central Bank and the Taiwan Provincial Government, and does not rely on any U.S. aid.</p>
<h3>Deadline Extended for Factories to Collect Allocated Coal to Next Monday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Industry Association announces: Regarding the collection of allocated coal by various factories in the city, the Industry Association, in consideration of the difficulties faced by various factories in circulating funds, specially consulted with the Coal Adjustment Association to extend the coal purchase date. The Association has agreed to extend the date to next Monday (March 28th). During this period, all factories can purchase coal, but they must pay according to the daily price.</p>
<h3>Discount and Lending Industry and Mining Advisor Held Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The 35th regular meeting of the Industry and Mining Advisor Committee of the Central Bank Discount and Lending Committee was held at 3:30 PM yesterday. Fourteen people, including Zhu Dijiujiu, attended. A total of 14 cases were submitted for review, of which 10 were approved and submitted to the Discount and Lending Committee for review next week. After the meeting, the Production and Export Business Loan Review Committee continued to meet. A total of 28 cases were submitted. As of press time, the meeting was still in progress.</p>
<h3>National Day Fine Cloth Sells Well</h3>
<p>The Hero and Golden Coin brand velvet produced by the Anle Textile Factory in this city is sold throughout the country. The factory has recently produced a large quantity of 12-pound National Day fine cloth, which is of excellent quality and is popular with all sectors, and its sales are very extensive.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>— The Spectator</p>
<p>The Beneficial Factors Are Not Working Anymore</p>
<p>Everyone finds it strange: now that credit is very loose and interest rates are high, prices are not improving, and stock prices are even more depressed. Isn't that odd?</p>
<p>Financial authorities listen and smile: secretly thinking that the current methods make sense.</p>
<p>Could it be that the current high-interest-rate policy is really preventing hoarding activities? If the fact that "prices are not improving" now is a result of the current policies, then that would be strange!</p>
<p>But one thing is certain: every day, the market price rises by more than 10%, and no one with goods thinks that it has risen. This huge desire that is not satisfied with a daily increase of 10% is indeed the only achievement of the current high-interest policy.</p>
<p>Is this achievement worthy of praise? Is it worthy of flattery? Please let the Central Bank authorities reflect on themselves!</p>
<p>Loose credit, high-interest rates, and the inability of goods to rise in price refer to the inability to generate enough profit to offset the interest. What is the reason for this? The reason is very simple: it's not fear of pressure from the Central Bank, nor fear of high interest rates. To put it bluntly, it's because the overall environment is not right.</p>
<p>In this environment, the ability to ensure one's own life is still a problem. If one were to carry a large pile of goods, wouldn't that be asking for trouble?</p>
<p>In the past, not hoarding goods was a big loss. Now, earning interest is not bad. It feels more flexible than hoarding goods. Because one can adapt to changes at any time, this point alone makes high-interest rates seem to have a spectator effect. But if the overall environment were not like today, then with interest as a base, the conditions for hoarding goods would be even better. So the problem lies in the overall environment, not in high-interest rates.</p>
<p>However, the high-interest-rate policy is absolutely correct from the perspective of the authorities' response strategy.</p>
<p>Because everyone is making a living by lending money, only doing paper-based business, the banknotes issued have great sales. This is the first reason.</p>
<p>Everyone is making money with paper, so no one is competing with the issuing authorities to purchase goods. The authorities can turn soft into hard as they wish. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>The shortage of spot sales is wonderfully effective in reducing inflation. At the same time, it increases the responsibility of inflated credit.</p>
<p>"Inflated credit" has always been a pretext used by the authorities with a straight face to shift the responsibility for inflation onto merchants.</p>
<p>Now, the overall environment affects some commodities in a sluggish state. In theory, credit expansion should not be possible. But tight spot sales mean that the effect is inevitable. There is also the temptation of high-interest rates, so one tries to force out loans even when they cannot be made.</p>
<p>This reveals a secret: the cash shortage and high-interest loans are the two major ingredients for creating and accelerating credit expansion. The sins of credit and inflation can then be diluted.</p>
<p>The current financial measures are truly infinitely subtle.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Trading Sluggish, Cotton Cloth Prices Weak and Declining</h3>
<p>The prospects for the yarn market are difficult to view optimistically. There are few buyers in the market due to a lack of funds. Generally, there is vigilance against the state bank selling cotton yarn and gold, silver, etc., so it is difficult to break the stagnant situation. Buyers are hesitant, and trading in the market is quiet.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix yarn declined from 4.25 million yuan all the way to 4.12 million yuan at the close, a decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to before. 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn was higher by 20,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened in the morning at 2.79 million yuan, then rose to a high of 2.81 million yuan, and then retreated to 2.75 million yuan at the close, ultimately falling by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at a high of 2.1 million yuan, immediately falling to 2.05 million yuan. Near the close, short positions were slightly covered, and the price returned to 2.065 million yuan, ultimately rising by 15,000 yuan. Factory orders ultimately traded at 2.05 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse was higher by 10,000 yuan. Price fluctuations for other yarns were narrow, with slight increases and decreases as a result.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was weak and unable to recover. This was due to the mediocre purchasing demand in the local market and the lack of intent to act on the part of merchant groups. There was strong selling pressure in the market yesterday, and it was difficult to expect any good recovery in the tired situation of the morning.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth opened in the morning at the noon closing price of 84,500 yuan from the previous day. Halfway through, surface groups had risen to push sales, once rising to 87,000 yuan. However, upon hearing near the close that external goods were all flat and tired, morale was scattered, and the rising trend ultimately failed to continue, retreating to a conclusion of 84,000 yuan, a decrease of 500 yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>Mid-range fine cloth such as Trumpet Boy and Five Blessings all fell by about 2,000 yuan each.</p>
<p>Sizijun yuan twill spun from 82,000 yuan all the way to 82,500 yuan for the highest, ended at 80,400 yuan, down slightly 100 yuan, Sizijun yuan zhigong remained high at 500 yuan, shilin cloth and other color cloth, the sales was narrow, privately owned factories operational there is a plummeting trend.</p>

<h3>Offering a Plan for Jen Yu in Mourning for His Troops: How to Resist the League Leader Tonight?</h3>
<p>If Jen Yu had not been defeated by Huili the previous evening, then tonight's game against Hualian would be a match of great importance, for if Jen Yu could defeat Hualian, it would be a show of strength with the same record of two losses. After being defeated by Huili, considering that this game is not stimulating enough, the Jen Yu generals must have lowered their high spirits.</p>
<p>However - I think Jen Yu should still value this game tonight. If they can defeat the league leader, even if they have no chance for the championship, it should still be a good thing. What's more, Jen Yu has had foreign coaches this year, and has the help of Cai Jindian, and Xu Zhong has returned. They had long been harboring this ambition, how could they become depressed because of this?</p>
<p>In fact, it is not yet time for Jen Yu to defeat Hualian this year. If they can continue to work together in the long run, there may be hope for the day in the next session. Even today, if I were Hualian's military advisor, I would have a brilliant plan to defeat Jen Yu. However - now I want to take advantage of Jen Yu being defeated by Huili and not being wary of Hualian to come up with a plan for Jen Yu, and to create a miracle of using a sad team.</p>
<p>Based on the strategies for today's game against Hualian, they will surely emphasize stability in offense and tight pressing in defense. Hualian's offense and defense are known for being slow and steady. Today, they will take a tight pressing approach against Jen Yu's defense, preventing Jen Yu, who are good at using methods, from playing their game. Therefore, Jen Yu should take a counteracting approach in offense and defense. Do the opposite. Take speed in offense, and a more relaxed approach in defense. Speed in offense avoids the tight pressing, hoping to gain a victory in stamina. A relaxed defense is not over-anxious, thus avoiding unnecessary fouls, and also reducing the opponent's chances of shooting, thus reducing points lost. If Jen Yu can do this, which I state lightly, Hualian will definitely have a headache.</p>
<p>In all respects, Hualian will definitely not just be defeated by Jen Yu, but the author wants to show the voice of the weak, and at the same time boost the morale of Jen Yu's athletes after their loss to Huili, and thus wrote this article. It is also to increase the interest of the enthusiasts. (Bi Xian)</p>

<h3>Today's A-League Soccer: Longtou Meets Qingbai; Youth Cup: Yingguang vs. Pan Team</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The soccer league, which has been dormant for a long time, has entered a tight and intense stage this week. Today there will be an A-League game at 3:30 PM at the Yiyuan Garden between Longtou and Qingbai. Tomorrow morning, Jingwu will fight Qunli, and in the afternoon, the Mayor's Cup final will be held. At 1:15 PM this afternoon, there will be a Youth Cup semi-final. Yingguang has defeated the Public Transportation team and won the Group C championship. Pan Team is the Group B championship team. In the Mayor's Cup, they lost to China Aviation by only 1-0. This semi-final is sure to be a great battle.</p>
<p>Longtou was defeated miserably by Qingbai in the first week of the league. Since then, both teams have been in poor condition, resulting in Longtou losing to Zhichao and Qingbai losing to China Aviation in the Mayor's Cup. After two weeks of rest, the two powerhouses have been recuperating and preparing for battle. After the new defeat, can Qingbai maintain its winning streak in the league? This will be determined in this battle.</p>
<p>Since Qu Yongfu injured his foot and retired, Qingbai has lacked an ideal center and right-wing forward. The lineup is not as complete as it was in the first week. The whole team emphasizes defense over offense. Luo Shoufu is the soul of the front line. If he can have tacit cooperation with Jin Lusheng, he will still pose a threat to Longtou's defense. However, Xiao Luo is the "lifeblood" of the forward line. If he is monitored, the attacking power of the entire line will be affected. Therefore, Longtou must restrain this to suppress Qingbai's offensive. Meng Yiliang is the mainstay in the middle. Xue and Jiang's skills have improved with time. Ren Yi reluctantly serves as left inside defender, which is not his original position. It is difficult for merchants to gallop across rivers and reach far. Therefore, there is more room for opportunity in this area. If you try to storm Qingbai's solid wall from the center, it will only be a waste of effort.</p>
<p>Longtou's tough style has its advantages. Its offensive is as rapid as a landslide, with courage to spare, but wisdom is insufficient. Those who are too brave and strong lack planning and are easily broken. Longtou seems to be approaching this situation. During the game, it charges forward with all its strength. If it cannot break through, its spirit will be frustrated, and the situation will be greatly reversed. The reason why they suffered a crushing defeat in the first week against Qingbai, despite having the upper hand, is the same. Learn from the past, Longtou generals should not repeat the mistakes of the past. During the attack, they should pay attention to the use of pincer attacks on both wings. The inside forwards should use a calm mind to lure them to the left and attack them from the right, avoiding their strengths and attacking their weaknesses, and do not expend too much energy. Therefore, there should be contact in position for joint attacks, and do not run blindly to waste energy.</p>
<p>The rear defender Wang Baoshan has a sweeping kicking style. The former inner defenders have steady and reliable feet. In defense, they must find a way to restrain the connection between Qingbai's Xiao Luo and Jin Lusheng. This is because Xiao Luo and Xiao Jin have the ability to kick and break through when they see an opportunity. The so-called "startled birds will strike, flying lowly and concealing their treasures, fierce beasts will fight, bowing down and prostrating." Luo and Jin will make noise before attacking, and the defender should know how to respond. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Huang Shijie</p>
<p>Qian Changrong, Jiang Geqing</p>
<p>Fu Jiutang, Zhang Renyi, Meng Yiliang, Xue Peiran</p>
<p>Luo Shoufu, Liu Longxin, Jing Linggui, Gu Yisa, Liu Tiyin</p>
<p>Longtou</p>
<p>Yan Chengbing, Gao Weichen</p>
<p>Zheng Bingyi, Li Chengxian</p>
<p>Wu Yi Min, Wang Baoshan, Shi Dafa</p>
<p>Zhang Jingen, Jiang Kun, Wang Burong, Chen Qin, Xia Shufu, Yao Qingsheng</p>

<h3>Central Aviation's Small Football Team Defeats Jin Kang</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Aviation Small Football Team faced the strong Jin Kang team at Longhua Airport. Yao Hua served as the referee. Chen Longquan, formerly of Central Aviation, returned to the team, greatly increasing its strength. After a fierce battle, Chen Longquan scored the first goal. In the second half, the Jin Kang team wanted to avenge past grievances, but Central Aviation's defense was solid, making it difficult for them to score. Goalkeeper Dong Jincai was particularly helpful, saving many dangerous shots. As a result, Central Aviation won the match 1-0. The team welcomes invitations to play from all sectors. Correspondence should be sent to the Central Aviation Company at Longhua Airport.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Meifeng Basketball Team</h3>
<p>The Meifeng Basketball Team was organized by Chen Haisheng and Fang Lian, who are enthusiastic about sports. Its establishment was announced yesterday at the Qishilin. The team welcomes invitations to play. Correspondence should be sent to the Meifeng Restaurant at the Stadium. The team roster is as follows:</p>
<p>(Leader) Chen Haisheng, (Advisors) Zhang Baokui, Huang Han, (Executive) Xu Jianhua, (Managers) Cen Yaoyuan, Ye Yunzhou, Ye Yunqing, Liu Kang, Lin Zhonghua, Xiao Mu, Shi Yuan, Lu Rong, Wang Zheng.</p>
<h3>Lanzhou Sports Venue Lacks Funds for Construction</h3>
<p>[Report from Lanzhou by our newspaper] As spring returns to the capital of Gansu, all sports activities are about to begin. The establishment of a sports stadium in Lanzhou has been brought up again, but after two or three meetings of the Municipal Sports Association, no resolution has been reached. The first difficulty is the location. In the past, there were plans to use the open space in Guan Garden. The site was large enough, but there would be no way to secure spectators. The public sports field in Hongshangen has a large area, but it is far from the city center, making it unsuitable due to inconvenient transportation. The second difficulty is the cost of construction. Although Chairman Guo and Mayor Guo have both advocated for its establishment, the amount of money required is considerable, and there is no tradition of selling tickets to events in the Northwest, so raising funds would be very difficult.</p>
<p>Last winter, the garrison headquarters established an ice skating rink to raise money for winter relief. The results were not ideal, and now that the ice has thawed, it has come to a satisfactory end. The land for the ice rink is public property of Zhongshan Forest. In the past, there was a tennis court there, but because tennis is seen as an aristocratic sport in the eyes of the people of the Northwest, many people are now calling for a small swimming pool to be built on this land. The Municipal Sports Association has accepted this suggestion and considered issues such as water sources and funding, and there are generally no major difficulties. However, the summer in the capital of Gansu is very short, and the hot weather does not last long, so this sport may not be able to attract much public interest.</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball Circle</h3>
<p>— Mei Jie</p>
<p>Talking About the University Student Army John Team</p>
<p>In principle, I should be writing about Xinghua today, but because of the photos, I think I'll write about Xinghua next week instead. Let's write about the John Team first.</p>
<p>This is a university student army team, and it is tied for first place with Shanghai University in this year's university league, so their performance should be good, but they only slightly beat the last-place Li team in the league, which is quite disappointing.</p>
<p>In terms of conditions: the team is superior to any other team, with appropriate age for sports and the essence selected from the masses. What's more, they are together every day, have good venues, and have ready-made guidance. I wonder if the team is taking advantage of these more favorable conditions?</p>
<p>Looking at the reality, several of her team members, such as Zhang Luoluo's height, Zhou Zhifen's activity, Zhu Min Li Miao's strong fitness, Yao Huijuan's intelligence, and Lin Jingyi's mind, are all top-notch materials in various analyses. If we add the good conditions, John should have achieved better results no matter what, but - if you take a cold look, she does have very obvious shortcomings. First, Lin Jingyi Zhu Min's basic movements are not good enough, so the guards have quick shots but lack a target, and the forwards are either too slow, or they are too fast and have no accuracy, wasting so much that they are the champions of each team, and they can't take advantage of following up, so they can't get points. Second; the team has a common casual mentality, which is evidenced by their clothing, and another example is their lateness. Although the focus is on sports and not on winning or losing, it is not a bad thing. However, it is also important to improve ball skills, increase standards and interest. I wonder what a few student soldiers think?</p>
<p>Speaking of coaching, it was Wu Xinyun at first, and now it's Qi Gongxiong. Although she has a coach, the performance seems to have no method at all, and she doesn't look like an organized team at all. The impression is of a rabble, each doing his own thing. It is said that Qi Gongxiong has not been a coach for a long time, and improvements under his guidance are undoubtedly expected.</p>
<p>Since it is difficult to discuss her team tactics, it is better to make a small comment on her personal strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Lin Jingyi - is the theory of the team's scoring, and the top-down shot has some truth, but because she is relatively short, she is easily blocked. If she can further study how to avoid people, it would be great.</p>
<p>Zhang Luoluo - has a good body like Wang Shan, if she can have the ability to follow up under the basket, wrist jump rope may be helpful.</p>
<p>Wu Hanyun - her medium and short shots are not bad, but there are two problems. Sometimes her shots are too slow and she is blocked, and sometimes she is too fast and too far away from the basket. If she can compromise a little, she can become an ideal front general.</p>
<p>Zhu Min - is indeed a good striker, but it is a loss to the team because she has left her alma mater and it is difficult for her to attend.</p>
<p>Li Miao - She is a typical forward guard, with a strong physique and strong wrist strength. She runs enough, but she hasn't grasped the basic movements of basketball, so she gets twice the result with half the effort, and it's hard to please.</p>
<p>Yao Huijuan - the most outstanding member of the guards, who can grab and use her position to block people, is quite commendable. Because of her lack of experience, she has not yet reached the peak of perfection, but she is highly expected in the future.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhifen - is a veteran and a former athlete of the Greater China Women's Jianyu Team, but it seems that she lacks training and her performance is quite poor, and her results are only deteriorating, not improving.</p>
<p>Above, the author has made many comments on her team, which may be too subjective, but it is indeed with sincerity, and I wish the team, with good conditions, can get the guidance of Qi Gongshi and make progress day by day, and cheer on the athletes.</p>

<h3>Don't Laugh Too Soon</h3>
<p>— Situ Shao</p>
<p>——Occasional Notes on Reading</p>
<p>After reading Bernard Shaw's books, I always feel that telling the truth is not easy.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, one must have keen eyes and outstanding knowledge, capable of discovering baseness beneath a gorgeous exterior and genuine nobility from the depths of baseness. But the difficulty does not lie here. What is most disheartening is that when you tell the truth, others mistake it for jest. Just as a fire breaks out in a circus, and the clown rushes onto the stage, shouting, "Fire! Help!" but the audience applauds and cheers, thinking the clown is performing a humorous interlude.</p>
<p>Bernard Shaw repeatedly warned of the tragic nature of humanity's future, but the response was only applause from the audience.</p>
<p>Applauding hastily upon seeing a superficial appearance, while forgetting the tragic implications of the facts, such people do not know whether they are laughing at Shaw's comedy or whether Shaw's comedy is silently slapping their faces.</p>
<p>More reflection will bring more understanding.</p>
<p>When reading Shaw's books, never laugh too soon. "The philosopher laughs last." Sometimes, the comicality of the facts you see is far less comical than the face you make when you "laugh too soon."</p>
<p>We are accustomed to baseness, so when we see something more noble, we find it laughable. Similarly, we are accustomed to lying, so when we suddenly hear a philosopher telling the truth, we mistake it for mockery.</p>
<p>Here is an anecdote about Shaw:</p>
<p>One day, Shaw went to an ophthalmologist to have his eyes checked. The doctor said his eyes were very normal. Initially, he assumed that "normal" meant like everyone else's. However, the doctor explained that normal eyes are not like ordinary people's; they are precisely unlike ordinary people's. There were fewer than ten people in all of London with normal eyes like his.</p>
<p>This was an epiphany for him: what ordinary people consider abnormal is, in fact, normal.</p>
<p>More reflection will bring more understanding. With more understanding, he will be ashamed of laughing too soon.</p>
<h3>New Type of Gramophone</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>After many years of experimentation, a new type of gramophone has been launched in the United States, and the price is not more expensive than a wireless radio. It can listen to phone calls for you, record wireless radio programs, leave your baby's first sound of crying when he was born, and can also be used to record debates in court or speeches at meetings.</p>
<p>The sound recording can be kept forever without damage, no matter how many times you reopen it. It can also be easily eliminated + and reused repeatedly. It can be stored in any climate or condition without damage.</p>
<p>This new type of gramophone is made according to the principle of magnetization. Although it has many forms, the size of the gramophone is about the same as a desktop radio. Inside the gramophone, there are two coils the size of fried dough twists. Between the coils, there is a two-mile-long wire like hair, which can be used to record continuously for 135 minutes. The recording principle of this wire is the same as that of ordinary gramophone records.</p>
<p>When the wire passes through the magnetic recording head, it records the sound according to the frequency and sound. It's just that what is left on the wire is not dots or lines, but magnetic impressions. To the naked eye, the wire is no different from before recording, because it has not undergone any physical changes.</p>
<p>After the recording is completed, the wire is wound onto the first coil, because the wire must proceed in the same direction for recording and playback. The recorder is also a player at the same time. It's just that when playing, the head acts as a speaker, and its function is the same as that of a stylus moving on a gramophone record.</p>
<p>This new type of gramophone can be attached to a wireless radio. Some have automatic switches that can automatically record when a certain program starts and automatically turn off when the program ends. That is to say, when you want to go to see a must-see movie at night, and at the same time you don't want to miss a must-hear wireless radio program, you only need to adjust the automatic switch, and you can hear the wireless radio program from the gramophone when you get home.</p>
<p>It can also be attached to a telephone. When you are out, it will record the words left by your friends. When you get home, you can turn it on and hear the report.</p>
<h3>The 1949 Model Car</h3>
<p>— Oriental Jing</p>
<p>Rather than calling the 1949 model car a "car," it would be more appropriate to call it a "land yacht." It seems less designed to suit the needs of the car owner and more designed to be flaunted in shop windows or color advertisements.</p>
<p>The 1949 model new car is huge and priced at US$2,000. Someone sold their 1941 car and replaced it with a 1949 model, but ran into problems when they drove it home because they couldn't drive it into the garage - the car was too wide and too long.</p>
<p>This wide and long car is designed to fit the "streamlined" goal, and it is also a psychological coercion for those who bought the 1947 model car, making them feel that they are driving an antique.</p>
<p>An expert said that this car is expensive, not durable, and not applicable. However, in any case, it is the 1949 model. The luggage compartment in the back of the car is large enough for you to put a piano inside.</p>
<h3>The Scholar is Useless</h3>
<p>— Thunder</p>
<p>The threat to life is increasing day by day. However, when I look at others, they are still enjoying themselves leisurely, and the feeling that "the scholar is useless" floats into my mind again.</p>
<p>In fact, "writing has misled me" is just an excuse for useless scholars. When has writing ever misled him? "Dudu writing in the air" is a portrayal of bookworms who dare not face reality, indicating that he only has the ability to "write in the air." This is my experience after being unemployed.</p>
<p>I happened to borrow a copy of "Gone with the Wind," which was originally for leisure, but it made me discover the crux of why I felt pressured by life. Isn't Rhett Butler the richest person in this novel? His wealth is because he has a way, and his way is to see that "the rise of a system, or the collapse of a system, is a good opportunity to make money." He not only faces reality, but also sees the facts clearly. As for whether this is contrary to the morality and conscience of a bookworm, that is another matter.</p>
<p>In fact, since the War of Resistance against Japan until now, when have we lacked Rhett Butler-type heroes? For example, those who made money from the national crisis, those who made money from victory, and those who made money from reception are as numerous as the carps crossing the river; even those who made money from peace, I am afraid that now and in the future, no one dares to say that there is no verbal criticism. Condemnation, investigation, and punishment, in their eyes, are just "sour grapes" tricks.</p>
<p>Another example is the scalpers who are looked down upon by the public. Aren't they also Rhett Butler-type heroes? They grabbed theater tickets, train tickets, boat tickets, allocated rice, allocated oil, and gold, until now, they are selling silver dollars. Aren't they also seeing reality clearly and getting it right?</p>
<p>The heroes mentioned above, although there are differences in size and strength, all have the same ability to seize opportunities and use opportunities. According to the natural law of the survival of the fittest, it cannot be said that this is social injustice.</p>
<p>Now, aren't there people lamenting that the income of a university professor is far less than that of a rickshaw driver, and that the life of a public official is not as good as that of a hawker? This is a fact, but it is also a natural phenomenon of natural law. Who told you not to take off your gown and break free from the shackles of the scholar's ideas? Who did it for you? Who caused it?</p>
<p>I admit that I am also deeply affected by the gown concept; I also believe that if I can take off my gown, I will definitely be more capable. However, the truth is that I still don't have the courage to take off my gown.</p>
<p>Complaining about heaven and blaming others is a superfluous act. So, "the scholar is useless" is just a self-deceiving smokescreen.</p>

<h3>More Notes on "Hate to See You Alive"</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>The "Hate to See You Alive" test screening notes published in this journal on March 18 only wrote about its outline. Now, I will divide it into singing, acting, and director's surgery to elaborate on it.</p>
<p>First, singing: In the whole play, the Yuanban, Kuaiban, Yaoban, Nanbangzi, and Erliu tunes are all good; what is especially moving is the Daoban in "Night Complaint," "I hear the first watch of the drum again," accompanied by Wang Shaoqing's huqin, which is really lingering and sad. The singing of the Xipi Kuaiban starting from "Escape from the Nunnery at Night," "The barbarian is too hateful," and the "Farewell" scene, closing the door while starting to cry Sanban, "The house leaks rain, snow adds frost," and expressing emotions with the water sleeves at the same time, can be said to be hearty and vivid.</p>
<p>Second, acting: Dr. Mei's water sleeve kung fu is the deepest. Every move is extremely beautiful. For example, the hand gestures when weaving in "Night Complaint," singing "Only I, facing the lonely lamp, guarding the empty room," both hands are out of the water sleeves, pointing at the lamp with two fingers, all kinds of postures, are really beautiful to the extreme. Western dance has the beauty of the waist's flexibility and the beauty of the legs' movements. Dr. Mei's water sleeve expression can be called the dance beauty of the hands. Also, such as the dodged stick during the "Torture" (there is a special term in the old drama, I accidentally forgot it). His figure and water sleeves are all in line with the dance posture. It is the beauty of Eastern art, and those who do not have real kung fu cannot reach this point. The shy expression on the face in "Dream" and the eyes when I first saw Cheng Pengju are really as Mr. Fei Mu said: "He played the role of women to the depths of women's dance souls."</p>
<p>Third; regarding the director's surgery, the whole is impeccable. Such as the clear scenery of "Nunnery Night Escape," a school of elegant emotions, the round field around the tree, using the technology of the stage, integrated into the film, can be described as seamless. For example, painting, within the inch, actually has the momentum of Xunzhang. Also, such as the death of Han Yuniang, the director did not perform the evil image of the corpse falling, only Han Yuniang sang the last sentence "The moon is cold on the Quantai," and the outside of the window showed a round moon, the population was not seen, and the singing was still lingering and endless, that is, the closing scene, which really has the meaning of leaving room for endless meaning. Director Fei Mu said: "I didn't do splendor in plainness." But I think that this film is elegant and colorful, which is his success.</p>
<p>In short, there are too many advantages in this film. The above is just a little understanding I got during my visit, and I put it forward as an aid for those who watch this film.</p>
<p>In addition, this achievement was originally compiled by Qi Rushan's Yixie Ji, and its story comes from Tao Zongyi's Zhui Geng Lu. After Mr. Xu Jichuan reorganized and recompiled it, it was changed to the current name of Shengsi Hen, and it is also recorded here.</p>
<h3>Please Doctor Remember</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuozhi</p>
<p>We have a saying in our hometown: "Poor people don't get sick, it's like having good luck." Because I have rarely been sick, although I have always had good luck, I am not very clear. It wasn't until last week, when I had a little illness, that although I only lay down for four days, it spent half a month's salary, and I realized the misfortune of poor people getting sick.</p>
<p>The disease came suddenly. The day before, I came back from the writing room in the afternoon, because I was caught in the rain, and I had a little fever at night. In the morning, I felt dizzy and my head was swollen, and my face was also red from the burning. I originally wanted to drink more boiled water and get through it, but by the next day, the situation was even worse, and the temperature had risen to about 103 degrees, so I was a little anxious. Thinking about it, I had to ask a doctor this time. Let's go to the hospital to register for an outpatient clinic, but I really can't afford to get out of bed; and it's raining again, I'm afraid that if I get wet in the rain, the disease will get worse. After thinking about it, I had to ask a doctor to come for a visit.</p>
<p>I asked a middle-class doctor, because I couldn't afford a famous doctor, and I was afraid that a too superficial doctor would not be able to treat me properly, and I would waste money in vain. In the afternoon, the doctor came, sitting in an old jeep card that rattled when it started. My wife was naturally very anxious, and repeatedly told him the cause of the disease and the situation in the past two days, and asked him: What kind of disease is this, and is it serious? But the doctor seemed to have no interest in these things, "ummed" twice, took out the stethoscope to listen, looked at his tongue, sat down and wrote a dragon-flying-phoenix-dancing prescription, and prepared to leave after closing his briefcase. Less than a quarter of an hour before and after.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, how much is the consultation fee?"</p>
<p>"Um, 26,000, plus 8,000 for the car fare."</p>
<p>I heard it on the bed and was taken aback, as if I was slightly sweating from the cold. 34,000! There are only 35,000 yuan in the family.</p>
<p>There was no way, so I had to count the banknotes and give them to him. As for the prescription, my wife immediately took two big heads out to fill it. Fortunately, the medicine only cost more than 5,000, so I only sold one big head. The clerk in the pharmacy said that it was just some aspirin-like medicine. I deeply regret that I shouldn't have made a fuss and asked the doctor this time.</p>
<p>The disease is cured, maybe it was cured by this cold sweat. Thinking about it, why should the doctor be so good-headed and take so much money from others, and still have that indifferent expression, which is really incomprehensible. Is it necessary to do so to show his high medical skills?</p>
<p>All businesses have costs, profits, and reproduction, etc. factors, and their pricing should be based on these factors to some extent. Public utilities are one example. Then why does a doctor charge two or three thousand for a single visit? As for the car fare, it is collected separately, which is enough for his gasoline fee and more. The hospital cannot be said to be a public utility, but at least it is closely related to the lives of ordinary people. I feel that the authorities must pay attention to it. Because hairdressing, bathing, and guest meals, etc. are all stipulated by the Social Affairs Bureau, then why can the doctor's consultation fee, especially the hospital's outpatient fee, be ignored and left to nature? This is taking advantage of people's danger, and the Social Affairs Bureau should come forward to stop it.</p>
<p>While writing this, a friend came to talk, took a look and smiled and said: "Why are you so upset? This is still good. I have a friend who went to a dentist to have his teeth pulled. The doctor didn't say how much money he wanted, he just said: Cheap, cheap. Unexpectedly, after the pliers clamped the tooth from the beginning, the doctor shook the pliers very vigorously twice, which made my friend so painful that his eyes turned black, and he almost fainted, but he saw the doctor standing in front, holding the pliers, glaring at my friend fiercely and said: You say! How much money do you give?"</p>
<p>I took a breath of cold air after hearing this.</p>
<p>I didn't dare to complain anymore.</p>
