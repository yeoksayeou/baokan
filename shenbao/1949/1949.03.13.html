<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕李代總統提名何應欽氏繼任行政院長，十二日下午經立法院投票同意後，此間政界人士反應甚佳，咸認何氏爲當前最適當之閣揆人選。立法院中絕對多數同意，亦可視爲今後立法行政兩院可望合作之象徵。彼等咸願早觀何氏新閣之組成。關於副院長及各部會首長人選，十二日復成各方揣測之對象。副院長之傳說人選，除顧孟餘黃紹竑外，尙有邵力子張治中。至各部會長則多認爲變動甚大，可望蟬聯者，僅三數人而已。惟一般相信：邵力子入閣之可能性甚大。某政界人士十二日晚語記者：行政院爲責任內閣，各部會首長係向院長負責，何應欽氏允任院長時，且曾表示主張確實建立責任內閣制度，此項意見李代總統亦表同意，故何氏之副院長及各部會首長人選，均須由何氏考慮，卽李代總統所擬推薦之人選亦須先與何氏商洽。該人士透露一部份部會首長人選，在何氏應允組閣時已有機會間接交換李代總統與何氏本人之意見。雙方之間並無過大之出入，一俟何氏由杭返京向李代總統請示後，即可作最後決定。</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京十二日電〕中共現正圖在孫科內閣之倒台中，找出最大之宣傳價値，共黨認爲孫科辭職，乃其「光榮和平」運動之「未成功」，並將此事與美國干涉中國內政之題目相聯繫。共黨電台謂美大使司徒雷登及四軍事參贊與白崇禧會談，以派遣代表至華盛頓，「成立與軍事人士之直接聯絡」。目前形勢在新政院視事前，對正式順從共黨條件各事，皆不能進行，而在三月十五日可進行實際談判之希望，現已消失。卽使李宗仁可立刻有一新閣，新內閣亦不得不在開始時重行審查已經採取之步驟也。共黨電台除對南京政府之一貫攻擊外，每日報告共黨努力使婦女學生工人及商人附合共黨之故事，幾乎每次廣播皆有民衆集會遊行之長篇描述。密切注意共黨廣播者及分析家，認爲此事之重要性乃透露共黨對獲得彼等佔領區民衆支持之努力。</p>

<p>〔本報杭州十二日電〕據悉：新閣首長人選，何氏係以「用新人，行新政」爲原則，將起用一部份新人，以革新中國走馬燈式政治。十二日本報記者曾趨訪何氏，渠表示新閣任務首在順應人民需要，謀取和平，並致力於改革政治，整編軍隊及整頓經濟現狀。何氏且已接受浙省地方人士之建議，今後當提高士兵之伙食費。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕何應欽氏受命組閣後，已決定以建立政治制度化，力求眞正做到責任內閣制爲努力之目標，此項目標並已獲得李代總統與中樞各要員之一致支持，認爲與團結·和平·革新等項政策同等重要。何氏此項努力之目標，係張治中氏於十二日午自杭返京後在李代總統宴在京國民黨中常委席上報告者。張氏稱：渠在杭勸何氏組閣時，何氏曾特別指出，過去政治之缺點爲政治制度化未建立，權責不明，職掌不分，希望今後能建立制度化，實行責任內閣，採取分層負責制度。張氏報告畢，各委員發言時，咸對此點予以支持。李代總統亦發言稱，渠提名何先生爲行政院長，卽完全相信何先生，決根據憲法之規定，使何先生能做到責任內閣制。十二日午李代總統宴在京國民黨中常委及中政委時，首先報告孫科辭職獲准，已提名何應欽氏爲行政院長，依據憲法規定，總統提名行政院長，爲憲法上賦予之職權，惟依政黨政治及國民黨之慣例，應先提請中常會通過，惟現以中央黨部遷穗，中常會無法舉行，爲權宜計，除已於十二日晨電穗中央黨部，請完成通過程序外，特於今午邀請各中常委徵求意見，希望予以同意，旋由甫自杭返抵京之吳忠信，張治中兩氏報告與白崇禧，顧祝同在杭勸促何氏組閣之經過。據吳·張二氏稱，何先生以目前局勢艱危，財政經濟難關重重，深恐難以勝任，曾一再堅辭，但經四氏責以大義，白崇禧氏並向何氏表示，在目前情勢之下，只有何先生始可担此重任，各方也絕對一致支持何先生，最後何氏始允勉爲其難。吳·張報告畢，各委員起立發言，一致同意何氏出任行政院長，接受李代總統之提任，並一致主張今後應求團結，求和平，求革新，裁軍，裁員，裁併機構。程潛亦應邀與會，渠起立發言謂，以地方官之立塲，決支持何先生。張羣發言謂，目前局勢雖甚艱難，但並非不可挽救，以飛機飛行爲例，逆風飛行，才可以飛得高，何先生在困難之局勢下，組閣才可以愈表現其貢獻。于右任氏並起立謂，今日爲何先生之生日，渠並已受命組閣，同時又爲程頌雲先生生日，故特舉杯爲祝，會中情緒融洽，與會之委員廿餘人，咸爲內閣組成而欣慰，熱烈發言，迄下午三時始散。十二日應邀與宴之中常委計有于右任，居正，張羣，吳鐵城，張治中，白崇禧，吳忠信，朱家驊，邵力子等。</p>
<h3 id="c8">孫科偕夫人抵滬　三四日後赴穗小作休養　謂欲安定物價有賴和平實現 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕孫科偕夫人於國父逝世紀念日—十二—之晨，由京抵滬。旋孫氏接見記者，表示除以沉默表達哀思外，家中別無其他舉動。次孫氏答覆有關時局問題，要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）本人三四日後可能赴廣州。今後將小作休養，並利用空餘時間，閱讀與世界問題有關之書籍，但不打算寫回憶錄，代理中政會主席之職，本人無意接受。（二）和談困難甚多，正式開始尙有待，個人之看法，基本之困難在國共之間諒解程度太淺，猜疑之心亦未消除。談到整軍問題，在財政上有此需要，至於和談過程中整軍之實際困難，只能請新行政院長答覆。（三）外傳中共要求以控制京·滬作爲和談先決條件，此乃將來之問題，很難實現。關於和平方案之內容，孫氏堅決拒絕透露，認爲將有碍和談之進行，與國家不利。（四）中共控制中國後，我國自不免傾向蘇聯集團，但站在人民立塲上，中國旣不應反美，亦不應反蘇，如此，將來世界上卽使不宰有新衝突，我國亦可置身事外，否則我國將重遭戰禍，其犧牲之重，恐一世紀尙難於恢復。中國今後除抵抗外國之武力侵略外，不應捲入其他紛爭之漩渦。（五）國民政府過去之外交政策，尙無大錯，但未收成效，此則由於戰後各國爭覇世界局面惡化所致，我們無能爲力，亦不能負此責任。就美國對華政策而言，過去之援華，乃利用我國作工具，個人並不贊成。（六）改革政治，須待和平實現，方能切實辦理。至於國民黨本身，實應檢討錯誤，痛改前非，方有復興希望。（七）當前物價及財政問題，唯有和平實現，方能安定。因和平後方可談到縮軍，撙節國庫開支，以我國之富力，平時至少能維特一百萬常備軍，但目前雙方之武力，何止六七百萬？本人過去主張縮軍至二百五十萬人，但軍事當局認爲無法做到。以美國之富，在冷戰中維持之海陸空全軍人數，亦不過一百五十萬人而已。</p>

<h3 id="c13">北平型 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>作者，是北平一家日報兼晚報的社長，在北平「局部和平」進行期中，他的日晚報都停刊了，他原來打算在北平住下去的。上月二十日他毅然地離開了北平，沿津浦綫到濟南，再由濟南到靑島，於本月初搭船抵滬。他寫下本文，一方面是記念這一段經過的日子，一方面在使大衆眞正明瞭現在的北平。</p>
<p>「局部和平便是投降」。閻錫山曾說這樣一句話。北平現在已經實現局部和平了。從北平的和平事實上證明，這句話是說對了，傅作義動下這一着棋，也許今日要有些後悔，不過他當時下這着棋，也有當時的環境條件和大勢。如果不暸解北平和談的前後經過，是不會明白北平爲什麼實現局部和平的眞相的。</p>
<p>當政府撤守長潘，在東北失敗以後，傅作義在他的高級幹部會議中，曾經檢討東北戰局的失敗，公開批評東北國軍是「不戰而敗」。他很自信的告訴他的幹部，如果林彪以十個縱隊進關，他是可以抵當得住，並將在華北的原野上，給共軍予以嚴重的打擊的·從他的軍事部署上，先後自動撤退秦皇島，葫蘆烏，承德，保定，涿縣，通縣，縮短戰綫，集結兵力來看，也都是配合着這個計劃，在努力期望固守平津的。</p>
<p>據傳的估計，林彪進關後，將在冀東方面有一次大會戰·所以從唐山到塘沽天津一帶的兵力，都大大地加强了。同時，把石覺的第九兵團，集結在密雲，通縣一帶應付這個局面。可是林彪部隊的行動並沒有合着他的如意算盤。在密雲吃去了石覺的四個團以後，便竄擾到平綏路和察北地區，用一部分兵力截斷平綏路，包圍平津佯攻，一部兵力却佔領北平西郊的制高點——南口，向西進與聶榮臻部分會合，在察北進攻傅作義的基本部隊三十五軍及暫三軍，首先將三十五軍包圍了，暫三軍爲援救三十五軍，來了一個反包圍，雖然使三十五軍鬆了一口氣，然而暫三軍又被共軍包圍了。幸而暫三軍軍長安春山是一個聰明幹練的將領，衝出了重圍，部隊却有些潰不成軍。安春山自己也被俘，化裝一個伙伕，沒有被發現而逃出來了。後來安春山陸續收容舊部，大約逃出約三分之二，便改編爲現在在北平城內，協同擔任警備任務的一〇四軍。安春山是個由士兵出身的將領，富有革命思想，傅作義倚之爲左右手。當安行踪不明之時，傅非常焦急！後來安逃到北平，傳見了非常　　，握着他的手，表示出無法形容的愉快</p>
<p>這是傅作義一着最大的錯棋！這一着棋不僅關係傅作義個人的成敗至大，而且影饗華北局面的發展，以至中國的前途，都非常重大！原來傅作義本已決定了撤退張家口，把他自己的基本部隊集中到平津來，參加平津保衛戰的。可是因爲傅作義曾親自回張家口去了一趟，接見了察哈爾省參議會的議長，長談了三小時之久，這位議長當然列舉了許多充分的理由，說明了張家口不可撤退，並懇切地要求不要把張家口撤守。人是一個感情動物，傅作義是從察綏起家的，受着這種感情的衝激，便應允了不撤守張家口。這一個錯誤的決定，不僅毀了張家口，毀了傅作義本人，而且毀了華北的大局！張家口旣不撤守，所以傅的基本部隊，如三十五軍，暫三軍，暫四軍，以及幾個騎兵旅，便都駐留在張家口及察北一帶，沒有調回平津。聶榮臻的部隊原來完全集結在察北，再加上林彪從關外調進來的新式砲兵和精銳部隊，便聯合向駐守新保安的三十五軍進攻。三十五軍固然是勇敢善戰的勁旅，在華北久負盛名。然而因行動上遲誤了兩個小時，同時共軍的砲火猛烈得使人抬不起頭來，因此死亡堆積，戰况慘烈！三十五軍軍長郭景雲也戰死在陣上。新保安失守後，張家口失了屏障，於是張家口便馬上騷動起來，入於混亂狀態中，那天下午三四點鐘新保安失守，張家口便決定於當晚撤退，然而察哈爾省這麼多的機關，還有暫四軍的部隊，一時下令撤退，當然是混亂不堪的！何况張家口的地形，是四面由山包圍的一塊盆地，西去的大道是兩山間的夾道，共軍據山加以攻擊，便更不用說了！報紙上所傳張家口各機關工廠是造册移交的報導，並非事實！</p>
<p>張家口結果還是失守了，傅作義的基本部隊也爲他而犧牲完了！這一個錯誤的決定，在後來還發生更大的影響，便是對於平津保衛戰的發展。傅作義曾爲此事，繞室而行，焦急萬狀，並且自己打自己的耳光。</p>
<p>張家口及察北的問題解決了，共軍便將張家口一帶的兵力轉移平津。聶榮臻部六個縱隊，編爲兩個兵團，林彪部留三個縱隊編爲一個兵團，這三個兵團困攻北平。其餘林彪部下原來在北平郊外的部隊，則調到天津外圍，開始向天津進攻，約計有八個縱隊之多。共軍向天津的攻擊，主力集中向西門，戰况最爲慘烈！前仆後繼，死亡在十數萬人；然而終於突破一點，攻進城區。在警備司令部的地下室，俘獲了正在指揮作戰的防守司令陳長捷，逼着他下令停戰，於是天津的砲火便告結束了。（待續）</p>

<h3 id="c14">星期論壇　運用合作組織穏定物價芻議 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 壽勉成</p>
<p>政府在最近半年以來，雖一再作財經改革，但物價終於不能穩定，此誠莫大憾事。如何使物價趨勢得以稍形平穩，並使生產運銷不致停頓，甚或發生物資逃避及倒流之現象。亟應補充制度化合理化之措施。現當中樞政局更新，何應欽將軍受命組閣，力讚英國工黨社會政策之際，本人以爲目下之經濟制度不能不有相當的改革，而合作組織實可對平價工作發揮極大功能。茲特擬具要點十則，以就敎於當世賢達。</p>
<p>（一）普設消費合作社，配給生活必需品。此種配給品之種類與數量可覜各地物產供求情形，分別規定。惟原則上應暫先從都市開始，並應限於少數物品，如糧食，布匹，食鹽，食油，燃料等五種。其中布疋，可以一二種爲限。是凡實行配給之物品，必須完全交由各城市綜合性之消費合作社，負責憑證配給，不能同時交商店參加配銷。無合作社地點，應卽促其組設，並予以房屋及設備上之補助。政府之目的，旣在爲人民穩定物價，並建立新經濟制度，此項一時之開支，不必計較。人口政府與合作社共同議定。如因事實需要，此項配給價格必須規定在成本以下時，其損失由政府補貼之。務使議定價格，不致隨時動搖。至現行拋售物資辦法，每爲投機商所利用，與平價之眞正目的未能盡符，實有改進之必要。</p>
<p>（二）並設產銷合作社，集中物資。配給之前提為物資。以往政府收購物資政策，或定價太低，生產者無法收回成本，使生產減少。或因大量物資在短期內利用廠商集中收購，物價每，而產地則朱加管制，致產地價格高於銷地，貨物遂絕流於都，從生產控制起；同時使合作社聯合設立倉庫，或由政府設立倉庫，儲藏各社產品。各社產品數量及其所存倉庫均應向政府報告登記，由政府派員抽查各倉所存物品，非經政府同意，不得移轉。政府向各社收購產品價格，由政府與合作社代表，依成本及合法利潤原則，共同議定，并應推行工業品及農產品交換制度。例如：收購糧食，可以布疋償付，以促農民之勇於納糧。上述五種配給品，現已各有機構負責專管，如再能於基層建立合作組織，與政府機構配合推進，使生產運銷及分配，建立一完整之體制，必可收平價實效。</p>
<p>（三）管制配給品工廠，統籌支配。　大規模紗廠布廠，現已有一部份受政府管制，應再擴大管制範團，以裕物資來源。此外榨油廠中之規模較大者，亦應由政府管制之。煤礦已有部份在政府管制中，亦應擴大管制範團，以利配給業務。凡由政府管制之塲廠，政府胞保障塲廠合理權益，并可以契約訂明管制年限·其原有負責人員，仍應留塲廠工作，而由政府指派大員俗察之。各塲廠出品，可分別指定其交付某地某合作社，你配給之用，或先送遠指定倉庫後，再由政府撥交各合作社。，</p>
<p>（四）實行節約消費，間接增加物資。爲使配給物資無虞匱乏，除增加生產外，應再節約消費，以濟其窮。以往提倡節約，每鮮大效。如能運用合作方式，當較易推行。例如：推行合作食堂，必可節省糧食及燃料。推行住宅合作，必可節省房屋及建築材料與用具。推行車輛合作，必可節省汽油。其理至明。</p>
<p>（五）加强出口貿易，平衡外匯收支。爲增加生產，平抑物價，自不能完全不用舶來議器原料及貨物。惟爲保特外匯平衡，此項進口貨，必以出口貨與之交換。目前我國出口貨大多爲農產品，農產品之能否增加出口，全視其產量之能否增加，品質之能否提高，及運銷技術之能否改進。爲達到此目的，必須有出口農產品之產銷及加工合作組織，且宜採取大規模合作組織，方能發生具體功效。至達到出口地後，或由政府統收統銷，或鼓勵合作社辦理出口，均可。惟如統收統銷，必不可限價過低，以保障人民應得利益。至現時出口農產，已有不少合作產品，如茶葉桐油花生苧蔴等是。此外尙有若千手工藝品，亦可獎勵合作出口，且已具相當基礎。以往獎勵出口，側重外匯價格，實亦應從生產運銷做起，方是根本辦法。故合作組織，極爲重要。（下接第四版）</p>

<p>〔合眾社羅馬十二日電〕義總理加斯貝利明日尋集國會特別會議，呼圓　覆共黨煽動民意以反對義加入大西洋公久之企圖。共黨領袖十二日下令罷工，並於廿三日舉行示威，以抗議政府之「戰爭政策」。在此舉數小時後，加氏遂決提前辯論，促議會對該問題及早作最後表決。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬十一日電〕義國會今日討論大西洋公約事，辯論甚烈。反對黨卽親共之多數社會黨領袖南尼提出之動議，經三一一對一六五票否決，政府安然獲得勝利。南尼動議中請政府向國會外委會詳細釋明義國對該約所負之任務。總理加斯貝利竭力主張加入該約先起發言，謂該約乃防杜戰爭之另一保障，未請義國担任超越其保衛可能性之任何事務。義國之戰略地位，不幸具有國際價値，故將竭其全力以求和平。加氏繼略述義國外交政策大綱，謂義國現甚注意與法國之關稅同盟，並創立歐洲議會二事。關於和約事，喀氏謂義國未請加以修正，今唯待義國之要求於和平氣氛中得償其願，喀氏結語稱揚政府在內國所樹之各種成績。總理致辭畢，南尼繼起發言，謂政府之主張加入大西洋公約，其嚴重實勝於墨索里尼政府於一九三九年決議加入軸心公約。共黨領袖陶格里亞蒂亦竭力抨擊該公約，謂將使全世界分裂爲二，該約實置義國於達到慘禍之道路，願政府續予釋明。於是外長史福薩起而作答，謂該約中並不附有秘密文件，亦無任何陰謀，談判皆公開爲之。外長作答畢，總理復登壇聲明擬將該約一切內容告知國會議員，並强調按諸憲法，政府可先商訂條約，而後提交國會辯論。今先請國會予政府以信任，而後談判條約，此在義國歷史上猶屬第一次。至是乃將南尼之動議付表決，而遭多數否決。</p>

<h3 id="c43">公用事業價格基數　今午開會審定發表　參會代表昨曾與各公司負責人力爭　股息問題成為爭執焦點 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公用事業價格經參議會議決依生活指數倍數調整後，其各項單位之基數，已決於今日下午發表。審定基數之原則，昨日業經決定，參議會公用小組委員會定於今日下午三時，假參會會議室召開臨時會議，討論決定公用事業之基數後發表之。新辦法於後日（十五日）本市職工生活費指數發表後，卽開始　行。</p>
<p>昨日市參議會公用小組委員會審定基數之代表江浩然·李文杰·朱扶九·虞舜·何元明等，會同本市各大公用事業公司負責人，假市銀行四樓竟日進行審定基數工作。會議自上午十時起，迄下午五時餘始散。據悉：昨日會議始終緊張熱烈，速午膳亦未能有休息時間。參會代表與公司當局爭執頗烈，相持不下者數次，因而基數昨未能順利審定。據記者探悉：爭執焦點在於股息問題，按上次公用小組會議業已決定，際此危難時期，任何事業應以服務爲前提，各公司之股息一項，應暫予剔除，而公司方面則堅持爲維護事業計，股息必須列入。至於基數一項，雙方同意以『八一九」價格爲根據，亦卽爲前次各公用事業以關元計價時所發表之基價，而所以相持不下者，參會認爲剔除股息後，其基數應按原來基價予以核减，而公司方面除對剔除股息一項堅持不肯接受外，表示其基數尙須較原定基價酌予增加，渠等認爲如公用事業價格以關元計價，則每天可按美金調整，現改由按生活指數調整後，公司每月只能漲價二次，爲彌補損失計，堅特基數必須提高，致雙方對審定基數之距離甚大，終於使昨日會議未能有具體結果。</p>
<p>參議會公用小組委員會爲顧全市民負擔計，對公用事業之基數，將堅持予以儘量抑低，故決定今午召開臨時會議，再予研究後，作最後之決定。全市市民所最爲關注之公用事業價格調整問題，今日當可有具體之結果矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市地價稅經地政局徵收以來，因物價波動太烈，而稅收係按法定數字征收，不能隨時調整，以致收入銳减，影響市庫，一般市市民對繳納地價稅，尙稱踴躍，惟少數大戶，反而意存觀望，延不繳納。彼等所持之理由，爲業主收入太少，無力負担。昨據地政局謝處長與錢秘書告記者稱：以哈同房地產之多，地價稅總數亦不過三百萬元，如謂無力繳納，殊難令人置信。依士地法第二百條之規定，逾期不繳稅款者增加罰款百分之二，因此數太小，嗣又經市政會議通過加催征費百分之十五，及加征百分之三十，惟數額仍屬甚少，中央有鑒於此，地政局昨接奉行政院命令，以通知書發出之日算起，如逾期遲延不繳者，按照中央銀行經濟研究處編製之當地物價指數乘應繳稅額，以此作爲罰款，每十天物價指數變動一次，將來　價稅稅收或可較有起色。該項新辦法，將於明日起實行云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕吉安路義業里卅八號啓新棉織廠，八日下午三時許，有百貨掮客王君康（甬人）來廠，選購男女汗衫，當由該廠經理胡進元招待，當時擇定五〇五號圓領衫一百五十打，六〇〇號女汗衫四十打，共値一百九十六萬五千元，卽命學徒方育林，張春鴻兩人，偕王將貨送至湖北路安東旅社，由該旅社二〇四號室客人殷才寳，孫斌賢至樓下將貨點收，並由王君康簽付福昌商業銀行支票一紙，票面爲一百九十六萬五千元，十一日期。豈知此支票到期竟遭退回，該廠追尋王君康無着，再尋殷孫兩人，據云五〇五號圓領衫一五〇打當夜轉售與南市方浜路永祥襪廠，由伊等三人送去，尙有女汗衫十打，藏在殷才寳家中。當將殷孫兩人扭交老閘警分局，報告經過情形，乃由股長張魁棟飭巡官王安邦率警孫志明馳往永祥襪廠，吊出大部份男女汗衫，一面並偵捕在逃之王君康歸案究辦。</p>

<p>（六）藝用美援，加强平價力量。吾人主張美援中之布匹糧貪，均應交由消費合作社，憑授配銷，並應優待貧苦人民及公敎人員之應得數量。肥料則交由農業合作社使用，亦應優待貧農及自耕農。此項配給品，應以收獲所得實物償還。其收回之農產，仍應分別性質，配鎖於消費合作社或工業合作社。</p>
<p>（七）消滅游資，試行劃帳制度。政府爲消滅游資來源，如能實行劃帳制度，旣可使每筆開支或貸款之來去，均可查考，並可减少貨幣流通之需要。例如：每一廠商或合作社，均向銀行開列帳戶，任何收支，均用票據，向銀行劃帳。各個人均以合作社爲樞紐，各銀行則合設劃帳所，則游資當不易產生。</p>
<p>改善金融設施，擴大平價產銷貸款。現今最進步之貨幣理論，卽爲管理本位。管理本位下流通之貨幣，卽如今日之金圓券。故通貨本身原無問題，其問題在通貨管理之技術。吾人如因恐通貨膨脹，不敢放款，一方面爲增加生產，又不敢不放款，結果必形成金融之矛盾現象。此種矛盾，必使生產旣不能增加，而通貨仍不免於膨脹。吾人以爲有幾種放款，可有補於物價之平定，不應認爲通貨之膨脹。第一，消費合作放款，可採購平價物品，實行平價配銷。第二，配給品生產放款，可收回實物，實行平價配銷。第三，農產品運銷合作放款，可使農民以農產品聯合運往市塲。依政府統制價格出售，免受中間剝削。第四，綏靖區各種合作放款，可以安定民生，收拾人心，並可用以搶購物資，封鎖物資。第五，出口物資產銷合作放款，可使出口貨不經商人之手，集中政府專設機構。此種放款，應充分作有計劃有統制之貸放，並應由中央銀行轉抵押，以宏成效。</p>
<p>（九）加强管理合作，促進健全發展。觀乎上述，必有人以爲此項計劃，惟有在合作社確實健全時，始可推行。其實不然，良以合作事業爲國人所辦各種事業中之一部門，人民品德能力，不能無優劣，卽各種事業之成績不能無差別。各種事業旣均不能無差別，合作事業自亦不能無優劣。吾人對合作組織，只問其在本質上及制度上是否比較合於理想要求，及其是否可能健全，不應超社會超時代而對合作予以苛求。吾人應以各種力量，在共同運用與共同獎助中，求其健全，方能謂爲公理。抑尤有進者，合作制度在港行中間，以其與旣得利益衝突，定當遭遇有力反抗，此爲任何社會化運動所不能免。如因有人反抗，卽輕於接受，不能堅定不變，則經濟制度將永遠無法改革！</p>
<p>（十）嚴行獎懲辦法，樹立風紀。平抑物價，旣以產銷及消費合作社與生產配給品之塲廠爲主體，則凡不屬於此項任務之私人事業，均應加以種種節制。其故意破壞平價政策，治以應得之罪，而對於此項合作社及塲廠，則應予以各種鼓勵。各合作社與塲廠間，可實行增產及平價競賽，其成績優異者，予以極榮譽之嘉獎。如此項合作社及平價塲廠中，有工作不力，或從中舞弊，與投機商人以相同之懲處。（三八，三，一二，）</p>

<p>砍伐樹木希速嚴禁</p>
<p>繼由潘議長致詞略稱：因果關係是互相循環的我們今天辛勤地把樹一棵棵種植，十年百年以後，必將綠樹成林，所謂種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆，不論爲人，求學，辦事，都不外乎這個原則。嗣由警察局長毛森致詞略稱：今天在公園裏看到一片綠色，象徵冬天業已過去，春天早已來臨，予人以興奮的熱情。目今的時局，猶如沉悶嚴冬，深信它瞬將過去，欣欣向榮之春天卽可到來。繼由萬理事長表示樹木種植後須善爲保護，最近時有發現軍人非法砍伐樹木情事，希當局速予嚴禁。參議員張中原則表示樹人樹木同屬重要，植樹節應顧到本市無數失學兒童。</p>

<p>— 本報特維記者　梁雨山　章蒙</p>
<p>〔本報桂林十日航訊〕李代總統夫人到塲的「三八節〕慶祝大會，較往年更爲熱鬧，到會千多人，祇有七個是男性。郭德潔講「家齊而後國治」的道理，並提出了兩句口號：「社會是我們的，廚房也是我們的。」</p>
<p>主席團一負的尹羲（桂劇皇后小金鳳）也演說，她說「今天婦女在社會上的地位非常痛苦，這種痛苦，是男人加給我們的。我是一個最痛苦的女人，我的生活經騐也很豐富。我以爲我們婦女自己應該設法翻身。嫁了不好的老公，是一件不好的事，我們就應該離婚。如果不離婚，痛苦就更深。我是過來人呢！」這位受知於馬君武的風流人物的這番話，引起了聽衆很大興趣。</p>
<p>這塲沒有「家庭婦女」參加的大會，在省府禮堂費了點半鐘方散。中午，榕城桂劇院招待婦女界，演出「怕老婆」，『三請梨花』，「三娘敎子」等齣。</p>
<p>婦女節便這樣過去了。</p>
<p>九日，發生一件男人欺負女人的事，成爲桂林市今年第一條花邊消息。女主角周競輝，中等身材，架上近視眼鏡，在大夏大學唸過中國文學。男主角秦書驥，是市府第一科科長，年紀與女的相差不遠，看去約卅二三歲模樣，這對「歡喜寃家」相識於六年前的夏天，不久周便做了秦的『抗戰夫人。」秦原有妻子，棄周不顧後，又姘上一個姓熊的。復員後第二年，周競輝千里尋夫，由浙携其將近四歲的女孩子來此。相見不歡，爭吵得無法再有和好的希望，市長調解也沒有多大效果。玩弄女人的秦某，惱怒得無所不爲，毆打之外，並唆使女友誘周改嫁。改嫁不成，秦以「紅帽子」給周，說：「有人說你是特務，現在你正在被監視之中。」周忍無可忍，祗好投訴報紙，向社會呼籲援助。、</p>
<p>「弱者，你的各字是女人。』在這個社會裏，周競輝的遭遇也許是很平凡的吧。</p>
<p>這裏再拖一條婦女新聞：西南紡織廠女工，於「三八節」向廠方請求放假一天，未獲結果，致引起全體罷工。廠方乃請各保人將工人領回，謂「女工等借口「三八」節，擅自停工，並煽惑其他女工採取同一行動，嗣經廠長領班勸導上班，竟拒不服從，請担保人領回』云，事後廠方開除女工三名，餘皆具悔過書復工。</p>

<p>又據徐輔蓀氏語記者，該公會會員原有一六八家，現在究有若干願意準備復業，尙待登記後方知。渠將明白指出，此次復業，係指金商業同業公會會員復業，並非金業交易所之復業，而金交之復業，目前顯不可能。金商業公會會員上次復業，尙係自卅五年三月迄卅六年二月八日之一短短階段，迄今已將兩年云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕財長徐堪昨在國行接見記者，據告：金銀公開市塲，遲至下週內（即本週）即可成立。現正由中央銀行研究具體方案，並已令上海金商業同業公會擬具黃金買賣辦法。將來買賣以現貨爲限。至該公會理事長，將由該公會自行推定，財部並不加以干涉。渠旋以堅決之口脗稱：此次頒布之財金新方案，決使貫澈到底，相信投機份子之力量，決無法與政府對敵。最後記者詢以在何應欽之新閣中，是否將蟬連財長一職，渠又堅決答稱：「這次決不願意再幹了！」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華股市况，昨日波動甚劇，走勢恍惚。晨間各股均以高盤開出，中間市勢堅穩，臨收突起回風，結果仍見軋升。晨初承隔夜銀根鬆象，頭寸供源較旺，業內暗息步低，人心好轉，於是買氣轉旺。嗣後金價暴落，人心廠軟，市勢直落。永紗晨開時在大戶欲擒故縱手腕下，卽以六元〇一分高盤登塲，多頭逢高吐售，曾小至五元七·八角，旋因貼息開低，黃金市勢盤升，紗布帮證券帮並有扒吸，升達漲限。中間數開數停，趨勢堅挺。十二時左右傳聞央行大量拋金，黃金慘瀉，業外人絲紗布一致暴落，浮多翻空，市勢跟軟，低至五·五二—五·四八。低後金融帮逢小有吸，市勢稍挺。惟因大量配金，臨收銀根繁俏，大勢已完，終以五·五六收市。升一成。</p>
<p>中小型股晨開在同一走勢下，風頭均健。美亞·信和·景福·上聯。永公五種一度漲停，故在低盤結束略升外，其餘均庸。</p>
<p>洋股盤升</p>
<p>洋股昨日市勢先高後低，初因外匯市價挺升，黃金走勢尙佳，更因週六關係，多空吐納不絕。怡紗先見一二三〇〇元，後瀉至一一·一〇〇元，一·一四〇〇元。亞洲一一二〇元，英聯一二五〇〇元，一三五〇〇元。會德豐三三〇〇〇元，三六〇〇〇元，各股均升半成左右。</p>
<p>金債向榮</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕黃金公債昨日晨開時檯面走勢看好，人心向榮。初喊十六萬有求，喊後證券帮卽納，市勢盤升。高至十七萬站住，最後以十七萬五千萬收盤，後市因週六無市。</p>

<p>在金融管理局嚴厲澈查之下，十一日之退票情况，已較前大爲减少。據票據交換所發表，十一日交換之票據，共有卅三萬餘張。其中退票佔二千三百四十一張，較前减少二千張左右。退票之總金額爲二億三千一百七十萬元，較前减少達十八億左右。惟至晚間九時始淸算完畢。據金管局表示，此番退票增多，全係各行莊中之客戶濫開空頭支票之故。故此次澈查時，將以檢查嫌疑客戶之賬目爲主，行莊本身之賬目爲次云。</p>
<p>又金管局自昨日起，同時澈查國家行局，今日仍在繼續詳查中。據記者獲悉，四行二局一庫中，果有非法放款或多付不應付之款項，其經管及主管人員將由該局檢舉，呈請財政部嚴辦云。</p>

<p>咋日米市又起猛烈漲風，以銀根轉鬆，人心頓堅，一致看高，况金價等均已比上日上漲，貨主力扳，市勢奔騰。北米市塲白粳及薄稻，均高達三萬七千元，前者漲七千元，後者升七千五百元，特粳迫近三關，開二萬九千元。南米市塲白粳及早薄稻各狂漲七千元，南京糙秈開三萬三千元，門售白粳已至四萬大關，均漲二成多，二市到貨共計五一五八石。</p>
<p>食油　漲勢益發狂烈，在銀根轉鬆下，貨主力扳，散戶急進，價狂竄二成，豆油最高曾至十五萬四千元，生菜油曾到十四萬七千元，收市浮多了售，價稍回落，豆油收市十四萬七千，生菜油爲十四萬三千元，各軋升二萬二三千元，漲有二成光景。大生凈生油達十九萬二千元之高價，豆餅漲二千元。</p>
<p>麵粉　市勢奔騰，開市以兩日拆息關係，在銀根鬆動下，北帮大量收進，貨主乘機竭力扳高，且有米價領導在先，人心罪常堅昻。兵船高做一萬五千零八十元，老車一度高做一萬五千七百元，麩皮去銷亦暢，跟挺二成左右，大包今做一萬二千三百元。</p>
<p>雜糧　展開熾烈漲風，生仁在來源瀕絕下，貨主扳持不放，市塲供不應求，揚州生仁猛挺三成，高做九萬五千元，提莊喊破十萬關，黃豆激挺二成，後市以油餅轉疲，回挫千元，乍豆退守三萬關，苞米挺升二成，白蔴急叩七關。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國行昨續配售黃金予銀樓業，上午十時許報出配價每兩爲卅二萬五千元，各銀樓申請共達一千九百餘兩，全部照配，惟申請時間因昨係週末，提早至中午十二時截止。各銀樓飾金上午掛卅四萬元，中午十二時後，金價步降，飾金亦掛小爲卅三萬元，條塊牌價爲卅三萬一千五百元。</p>
<p>金鈔昨日市勢初因銀根竟鬆，買氣尙旺，惟浮多懼有反響，逢高卽脫，空頭頗具戒心，稍低卽補。前市交易尙旺，晨開卽高，高後堅檔盤旋。正午央行力拋，市勢壓軟，結果低盤收市，隔夜多頭虧蝕至鉅。晨開承隔昨俏勢兼之銀根尙鬆，散多並納初盤爲三三三〇〇〇元，三三八〇〇〇元，開後市勢盤旋，未分榮辱，十一時半以後，央行力拋，小至二九五〇〇〇元，二九八〇〇〇元，小後散空抵補，臨收回好一盤，前市以三〇五〇〇〇元，三〇八〇〇〇元了結。午後銀根轉俏，但週六無正式交易，加兩天息，下週一頭寸喊三四八〇〇〇元，三五三〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>美鈔晨開六六五〇元，六七五〇元，中間微盤，近午隨黃金慘瀉。市勢亦小，爲五九〇〇元，五九五〇元。午收回升爲六一〇〇元，六一五〇元，午後未聞喊價。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕港匯昨日再縮，晨開每千元六角九分，前收六角七分半，金圓券每千咋晨開一元二角半，前收一元二角。港金每兩昨晨開三〇五元，前收三〇五元二角五分，美金電匯昨晨開五元二角二分，前收同價。</p>

<p>五拋齊下戰果赫赫　「放火救火」同為一人</p>
<p>昨晚金融街上，風聲鶴唳，不少行莊，頭寸軋不攏，搖搖動。　中央銀行負起銀行之銀行的責任來了，開門做夜市，接受這批動搖中的行莊們，摔了金條上門，照三百萬元一條，兌予頭寸。雖則昨天上午央行的配金價是三百二十五萬元。</p>
<p>近幾週，週六午後的市面，多數狂昇的。昨天却例外的出現了狂跌。傍晚六時以後，暗息竟高出二元五角，可謂空前之至　更妙的是，昨晨開盤之後，各市都欣欣然。當然囉，央行配金價首先從二十九萬元，提高爲三十二萬五千元，結匯證也提高到五千六百元，人心那能不興奮？</p>
<p>豈知，誰都自投羅網了。</p>
<p>午前十點鐘敲過不久，各市塲裏都突傳當局拋售實貨的消息。</p>
<p>拋金，拋美鈔，拋紗，拋糖，拋結匯證，五拋齊下，聲勢浩大，竟使人人嚇傷。股市狂升疾瀉，金鈔勁跌不已，從此直至深宵，全在陰風慘雨中。</p>
<p>反法西斯戰爭中，「予打擊者以打擊」</p>
<p>反投機戰爭中嗎？果來個「予投機者以投機」罷！</p>
<p>不是嗎？掛高牌價在前，迎頭棒喝於後，雖則跡近投機，但對付投機者，實在也不必講禮貌。</p>
<p>這一打擊中，投機商果有軋倒，自不會有人同情他們。問題是：對於穩定民生，究有若何貢獻？</p>
<p>卽拿風緊雨急的昨天市面來看，民生密切有關的米糧，油·粉·紗布·煤斤·五洋等主要商品市塲，無一受此打擊影響，仍是無不激漲。</p>
<p>商品市塲，本來不若投機性金融品市塲靈敏，打擊投機性金融品市塲時，一時未能影響於商品市塲，實亦情理中事。唯其如此，這種攻勢，不應有取快一時的態度，而宜作長期抵抗的打算。那末所傳金銀市塲之籌備等等，豈僅看不出有根絕投機的準備，反有放任投機的傾向。那末，昨天這種措置，能不令人有「放火救火，同爲一人」之感了。</p>

<p>昨日紗市續告秀挺，蓋市上銀根走勢略鬆，人心浮動，粵帮零星交易活潑，複製業對於細紗亦殊垂靑，各紗初開卽昻，是以烚赤及業外物品均皆報漲，本街搜吸尤暢，新高峯層出不窮。近午聞國行無限拋售黃金，且圈外一致迫跌，漲勢乃告不繼，急轉直下，終以軟檔收市，但較前仍多軋升</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由二百六十五萬元直叩二百八十萬元，臨收浮戶了結甚衆，價卽回小至二百五十七萬元，終挺二十八萬元·四〇支與三二支各升二十萬元至二十五萬元不等，二一支雙馬現貨自一百三十萬元喊俏至一百三十六萬元，終爲一百二十六萬五千元，軋漲十二萬元，二〇支以下各級俱昻十五萬元左右。</p>
<p>棉布一致回漲，良以銀根轉鬆，買風重告展開，本客伸手甚繁，晨初在握貨者扳持之下，各布站立高檔，繼以散多仍有脫手，臨收稍見鬆弛。</p>
<p>龍頭細布由四萬六千七百元開出，一度曾高見四萬七千六百元後。午後塲外雖見喊高至五萬元（週一出），但較之午收尙不够二天拆息，喇叭童細布漲起五千四百元，他若銀月與寳貝細布等亦告帶俏。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰開市四萬五千五百元，最高達四萬五千七百元，終爲四萬四千九百元，軋升四千四百元。下午聞四萬九千元略有成交，四君子白印元嗶嘰做三萬九千八百元，一九〇高檔士林叩十萬元大關，花嗶嘰漲達五萬元</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國行業務局負責人昨語記者，自國行陸續拋配黃金後，本市金融性之物品價格，已較平定。相信下週起，情形將更見好轉。惟目前單獨控制金融性物品之價格，尙不足抑平一般物價。故當局現已擬就另一部辦法，使與國行之拋配黃金物資等配合後，必能子投機商以嚴厲之打擊云。</p>

<h3 id="c86">鐵路中航今日決戰　市長盃究是誰家天下？　貢獻兩隊攻守之策 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四届市長杯足球賽，鐵路對中航，定今日下午三時起，在逸園球場作奪標決賽。足球委員會特請昊市長蒞場行開球證，並親自給獎，授予市長杯。比賽情形，上海廣播電台將派員在場，自下午三時起播送當時戰情，球場秩序由四維童子軍維持。今日門劵價目照舊，仍為六百元及四百元兩種。市長杯足球賽開賽以來業已三週，將於今日圓滿閉幕。今日裁判員張樂，巡邊員倪孝本陸順總。</p>
<p>鐵路本有問鼎聯賽錦標之雄心，奈以受挫於青白，壯志難酬，今者青白已遭淘汰，大敵已去，本是千戰一時之良機，勢必以全力爭取此盃，以鐵路之最近狀態而言，有染指錦標之希望。鐵路之唯一特點是擁有高保正之穩健第三內衛，全隊採用嫻熟的小派司，張傑之衝射與陸慶祥之頭攻；後防　高保正獨力支持，仁孝位買好而没有堅硬之腳頭，嘉邦勇而行動迂緩，前衛善於供而不精於掠奪，兩翼鋒不能飛翔，苟中航之攻勢是避實而繫處，取兩翼切入而　之以中央突破之戰略，使保正被動而誘離腹地，則鐵路可能遭受到嚴重之威脅，若要擎肘中航前鋒之活動應拒之於中場，蓋諸小將夠勇和富有速度，一旦擺脱則有如溜韁之馬，長驅直馳，則禡構矣。鐵路之短傳，誠屬可愛，故兩翼應增加速度與機智以彌補前鋒迂緩之弱點，射門患在於猶豫，此為弱點，要知握機貴在乘時，使守者措手不及，才有攻破福生鐵門之機會，所以；鐵路要看前鋒之狀態而定勝負，因後防有保正在，尚有可為，「進攻為最佳之防守」能加强攻勢，可減低守衛所遭受之威脅，若能先拔頭籌，首樹以威，則可操勝券也。</p>
<p>中航若往港借將，可破鐵路，若以原班人馬上陣，亦能予以威脅，小將在兩週來苦練不倦，壯志如虹，有人說：「小將擎走青白，不過是替人作嫁衣裳，徒勞而已」，但小將說得好，他們非為人謀而是希望將這件黄袍穿在自家人身上，這是小將的野心，與鐵路當應有激戰。</p>
<p>中航之排陣，當要番慎，要兩翼齊飛，非用徐祖國充翼鋒不可；既要齊飛則中央突破來完成最後突擊之一腳責任應由高秀清担，而以殷慶炳，陳宇偉分任內鋒，秀清善射，近況甚佳，中鋒之位置突出而射門之機會亦較多，前衛平平，是靠拼的精神，若掠得球時須大腳送出前鋒，蓋鐵路運用短傳遞，前衛亦須離防推進，協助進攻，務使其前衛不及返防而中航始能把握着主動之攻勢，故必須有遠送前鋒而以實擎處，若祗靠盤球來輸送，則迂緩而鐵路之前衛已返防，可從容佈陣以迎擎也。</p>
<p>精於頭球者祗謝錫川一人，效平須看牢蕭子文，商華均當不易抑制陸慶祥之頭攻，川瀚亦不易阻撓張傑之竄進，倘要減少頭攻之威脅，必須阻撓兩翼之傳中，擎肘張傑之竄進，須釘牢蕭陸兩內鋒之活動，首要抵禦鐵路之攻勢，然後可以攻破其守勢，中航更須拿出奮鬥精神來應付此場大戰，球運亦是獲勝之因素，中航兩次大難不死，其有厚福歟？（戚公）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽，昨晚華聯「一路順風」，五十五比四十二戰勝海青，上半時三十八比十八。觀眾人聲鼎沸，異常興奮。上半時華聯的瘋狂攻勢，五將收獲平均，打來乾淨清楚，各個表演，令人滿意，華聯佔足上風。下半時普遍卜場，海青始有競爭可能。女子組星華三十八比十四勝力隊，上半時十八比九。甲二B郵電五五比三十勝合衆，上半時二十四比十九。</p>
<p>華聯昨晚以傳金聲，昊成章，劉福善，李震中，包松圓五將，對付海青。開賽後，金聲没有罰中，凱克爾立報一球，震中從這邊籃下獲球，送進那邊籃內。傳包再添兩球，六比二聲勢煊赫。包及派克斯凱克爾復各增一球，此際海青已三個黑人，二個白人，陣容變動。</p>
<p>震中的遠投，吉勃遜的暗箭，吴傳劉的不絕進攻，十分鐘時對方又成二黑三白，成章的偷「冷飯」劉傳包的狂襲姿態，四座叫好。</p>
<p>小黑炭潘諾克擲中時，摇頭不止，勃倫霍獲中調出，他們中間頂黑的派克斯，也望凖籃圈投去，該隊連中三元，不久成三十三比十八，華聯的威風稍挫。可是松圓的大步子探籃，復增加着海青的負担，上半時華聯三十八，海青十八，勝負之數，業已大定</p>
<p>休息再戰，略有調動，華聯由樂嘉洲，張良雄代震中金聲，華聯在下半時方首次犯規，足見他們心理的並不緊張。海青勃倫霍吉勃蓀的不中不休精神，和三個黑炭團的跟着敵人，影形不離。四六比廿五，海青漸入佳境，不久漢庭替福善出，五十比廿五，華聯第二次犯規，海青的不罷不休，華聯最後以五五比四二勝，並不相差太多。</p>

<p>范妮對練習確肯下苦功，除了前後兩次生產時不得暫停數月外，這些年來，從未間斷過。戰爭期間，没有國際好手供她攻錯，而荷闌國內所有的女運動員，又都不願和這位跑起來像脱韁之馬一樣的急先鋒賽跑；一氣之下，范妮決定和鬚眉們一決雌雄。一九四三年一次運動會中，范妮真的報名加入男子組，結果以十一秒五跑畢百公尺，列第四，居然打倒了其他兩位紏紏武夫。</p>
<p>直至一九四六年，范妮才有機會畫展所長。在挪威奧斯羅城的全歐運動會中，以產後不足七月休養之身，再加上一雙在百公尺決賽中已經扭傷了的膝踝，范妮非但在八十公尺欄賽中壓倒羣雌，並且還替荷闌的接力隊爭得了第一名。</p>
<p>去年十四届世運大會中，范妮經歷了一次最警險緊張的場面；這次，連一向鎮靜過人的詹恩—他仍然榮任荷闌代表團的總教練—也有點不能自持。是八月四日午後三時的八十公尺跨欄決賽，兩天前已經以十一秒九得了百米錦標的范妮，現在要和「英國的希望」茄特娜小姐量短長了。美麗的茄特娜小姐才十九歲，是牛津大學的舞蹈教師。那是英國的報紙都說「范妮柯恩没有希望勝利，她太老了。」</p>
<p>正當其他五員選手在跑道上聚精會神，等候着出發的信號時，范妮忽然呆住了，連槍聲都没有聽見，直到其他五人都已經跑近第一欄時才本能地驚醒起步，瘋狂地向前衝，但她那捷逾野兔的步子卻仍能追上其他賽員，和茄特娜同時到達終點。</p>
<p>范妮和茄特娜孰先孰後，簡直非肉眼所能分辨。在白綫處用電動機攝就的影片還未沖出，突然，樂隊奏起了英國國歌，看臺上歡聲雷動，場內性急的記者和賽員，都爭向茄特娜道賀，連茄特娜本人也在為能替祖國奪得第一塊金牌而沾沾自喜。那邊，嗒然若喪的范妮正在找尋詹恩預備向他認錯，突然，正式結果公佈了，范妮和茄特娜雖然同以十一秒二打破世界紀錄，影片上卻顯出首達終點的范妮，茄特娜以一鼻之差，只好屈居第二。范妮這才明白，剛才樂隊的演奏和觀衆的呐喊，原來歡迎英皇英後御駕親臨，來作大會的不速客。</p>
<p>為責任心所驅使，范妮還是向詹恩道歉；因為年初在阿姆斯達丹練習時曾有過十一秒正的紀錄，要不是起步太慢，可能跑進十一秒，更不必慮詹恩和她自己一場乾急了。</p>
<p>兩天後，范妮又以廿四秒的紀錄得二百米冠軍，使一九三二年洛杉磯大會中連得標槍，跳欄兩項第一和另一項第二的狄德蓀黯然失色。女子獨得三塊金塊，也替奧林匹克歷史寫下新的一頁。</p>
<p>大會結束前，范妮又像火車頭一樣拉着已經落後了的荷闌接力隊，超出其他五路娘子軍。和一九三六年在柏林為大會創連得四項榮譽獎的紀錄的怪傑歐文思後先輝映。</p>
<p>邀請范妮前往表演的請柬自世界各大都市如雪片般飛來，白蘭克斯闔家也都樂於接受，去年九月，范妮在芬京以十一秒二平她自己的八十米跨欄紀錄。今年春天，范妮·詹恩，還有兩個小孩，又踏上飛機，作第一次歐洲以外的長征，飛到澳洲去了。</p>
<p>范妮在家，很少有二分鐘以上的安閒。她的時間，差不多都花在在廚房與飯廳間奔來撲去。此外，便是服待詹恩和兩個孩子了。她早上七點半起床，早餐預備好了以後，便要替孩子們梳洗了。單是騙他們刷牙齒，這位荷闌式的母親就有好一會要弄得手忙腳亂。送了大孩子上學校，收拾床被，洗掃房屋，然後帶着那個兩歲的小女兒上菜場，買配給證准她買的東西——每人每二星期一雙雞蛋，一個月一磅乳酪，和只有週末才買得着的肉——幸虧青菜和洋山芋已經不再統制配給了。（德軍佔領期間，每天早上五時便要排隊擠麺包呢！）</p>
<p>午後是洗滌和釘補，而大部份時間則花在編織絨綫衣服上。兩個孩子和她自己身上的衣服，大都是她一雙手的製成品。</p>
<p>晚上七時左右進餐，飯後有朋友來便打打「橋牌」，聊聊天。否則便以閱讀為消遣。他們這家過的便是這樣平凡的生活。</p>
<p>詹恩在警察局的年薪是五千銀幣（約合一千八百五十美元）。另外替幾家報紙寫稿每年也有二千銀幣以上收入。他還是一個好記者呢！倫敦大會時他替荷闌某大報發電寫通訊。范妮戰勝茄特娜時，他報導說：「世界最優良之跳欄家於千鈞一發中獲得勝利，情況之緊張險恶，使記者之脈搏，至今尚未恢复正常」。</p>
<p>像時鐘一樣準確，范妮每週二次每次二小時在奧林匹克運動場練習，以保持水凖。「她的姿勢」，詹恩說：「除了手指還略嫌不夠鬆弛外，（參閱十一日所刊銅圖百米終點時所攝對手指之特寫）。可說是無暇可擊了」。但是實際上，范妮僵硬的手指正和她每賽前必有的怯懦一樣不足為病。到目前為止，范妮·柯恩是五項世界紀錄的保持人，——百公尺，百碼，八十公尺跨欄，跳高（一·米·七一）和跳遠（六米二五）。〔全文完〕</p>

<h3 id="c91">談書的索引工作 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 江宇</p>
<p>讀西文書，特別是社會科學方面的書，有一點最使我欽似，發生深刻印象的，就是他們索引工作的精確完備，使人讀過以後，只要隨時利用後面的索引，就可一翻卽得，永為我用。據說，卷帙浩繁如莎士比亞全集者，也有人做極詳細的索引，連某字常用，某字不常用，某字用過幾次，也都有精確的統計與詮註。這種專致的精神，眞是令人驚歎。文化本是數千年來人類心力的累積，因為有這種人的貢獻，文化的基礎才得堅固不拔。</p>
<p>當然，對於某種學問或某部著作的深入的研究，我國也古已有之，且並不比外國差，所謂「皓首窮經」，就是這種精神的表現。不過，其結果，常不是鑽了牛角尖，就是只形成了自己思想的反映；對於後來人的研究，常不能達到其舖路架橋的任務。這，原因固然有許多方面，但索引工作的不被重視，不科學化與系統化，當亦是主要的癥結之一。</p>
<p>我國過去長時期的以科舉取士，四書五經不知弄白了多少讀書人的頭髮。但卽使是這幾部當時士子所必讀的經典，詮釋之作雖多，而就事論事的，系統的索引工作，也從未見有人做過，近數十年來，中文的自然科學和社會科學的著作也出了不少，由於事實需要，索引工作已有人肯認眞地做，但離合用的標準，還是甚遠。我們讀了一部書，要完備地利用這裏面所有的材料，總覺力不從心，這是一個亟需彌補的缺陷。</p>
<p>由於文字的關係，外國書的索引容易做，也容易查檢，這是事實。但這困難也不是不可能克服的，問題只是在如何覓取適當的字眼，來代表某種意念或者思想；而這種代表的方法，又須為一般人所共同瞭解與接受。要硬性制定是很難的，我覺得不妨聽其自然，如果每一部書，每一位著作者，都向這個方向努力，起初固然不免大有歧異，但慢慢地也必可融和出一條路來，使人人都能利用的。</p>

<p>— 施家豪</p>
<p>世界上最苦惱的人，莫過於啞子和盲人了。</p>
<p>歐美各文明國家，為了這二種可憐人，特地抽出大宗款項，辦理盲啞學校，施行特種敎育，非但使啞子也能和常人一般能看能寫，卽使盲人，用凸字形的特種書籍，也能摸讀文字，刺寫書信。</p>
<p>但盲人所用的書籍，必須特製，至於普通平板的書籍，則不能應用，這是一個很大的缺點。於是，美國有一科學家名諾姆白克的，最近發明了盲人讀書機，補救這個缺點，為全世界盲人造福。</p>
<p>靠了這機器，無論何種雀籍，不消多久，便能轉化成凸字，並且加以擴大，盲人卽可隨意摸讀了。</p>
<p>這機器，是由播送與印刷兩部分合成的。播送機專使照射書籍上的文字，使其形象傳射於印刷機。印刷機中的印刷車，卽在薄鉛板上左右橫行，穿成點綫，成為浮凸的文字。</p>
<p>欲保留鉛板上的文字，可將鉛板留存，否則，可將鉛板通過二個轉動的圓筒，則浮凸的文字，卽被壓去，鉛板又可供下次使用。</p>
<p>盲人們對於這架機器，祗要有一個月的練習，就能應用自如，任何書籍，都可摸讀了。</p>

<p>筆者自慚文不能安邦，武不能定國，在此亂世，只得學古人的「興來寫幅幽蘭賣，不使人間造孽錢」，聊以餬口。現在春蘭正值盛開，小庭園中數盆蘭花的淸氣幽香，由風先生的介紹，一陣陣地撲到我的鼻中，透入心肺，使我愁眉大展，煩惱頓消。走近了去觀賞，更覺得如對故人，似逢君子，歡慰之情，不可言喻。</p>
<p>古人說：「蘭以比君子，蕙比士大夫，人物雖云異，氣味乃不殊」，誠非虛語。</p>
<p>植蘭很難，先務及時，度地居之，順其陰陽，遂其天性，淡灌除虫，尤宜注意。</p>
<p>畫蘭亦大非易事。寫蘭之玅，氣韵為先；墨須精品，水必淸泉；硯去宿垢，筆純忌堅；手如掣電，不容緩延；紙上飛動，神龍活現。</p>

<p>— 翼羣</p>
<p>薛福成「庸　筆記」裏，有一篇記淸道光時淸江浦（今江蘇淸河縣）一般治河官吏的奢侈糜爛生活的文字，看了眞是叫人驚心動魄。</p>
<p>單講吃一件事，一次宴席，因為千奇百怪的山珍海味太豐盛了，三天三夜，還不能終席，所以沒有一個客人能够吃到底的。總是吃到酒闌人倦的時候，就離了席。</p>
<p>吃的是些什麼東西呢？那是千奇百怪，而慘絕人寰的，虧得他們異想天開，想得出這許多妙法。譬如一碗所謂「隊脯」，是取幾十條肥豬背脊上的肉做成的（別的部位的肉都拋掉不要）。而這幾十條倒霉的猪，也並不是痛痛快快，「白刀子進，紅刀子出」，把生命結束了的，却是用竹棍子活活打死。因為據說這樣打死的猪，全體精華，都集於背部，所以背肉甘脆無比云。</p>
<p>如所謂「鵝掌」，每不席需數十百鵝。做法是把羣鵝趕到燒紅的鐵皮上，叫它們走頭無路，活活燙死，每鵝僅取二掌，其餘部分都不要。理由也是一樣，因為這樣「炮烙」而死的鵝，精華集中在脚掌，別的部分是不堪入口的。</p>
<p>如所謂「駝峯」，是把壯健的駱駝栓在柱子上，用開水淋背，直到淋死，精華集於駝峯了，便割取一峯而棄全駝。這樣三四隻駱駝才凑得成一席駝峯。</p>
<p>如「猴腦」，是在食桌中央開一圓孔，置一隻猴於桌子底下，頭從孔內伸出，用木頭固定，使不得脫出。先給可憐的猴兒剃個光頭，再把頭皮剝開，隨卽用熱湯澆淋，同時用鐵椎擊破頭骨。於是，在哀嘯聲中？客人可用銀匙舀腦漿吃了。</p>
<p>又如「魚羹」，是用大活鯉，倒懸在樑上，敲破它的頭，鮮血滴落，下用一鍋沸水盛受，魚在蒸氣中痛苦萬狀，疾首縮尾，直到蒸死；然後另換一魚·這樣幾十條魚，可做成一碗血糊糊的魚羹。</p>
<p>你看這够多麼奢侈，又是多麼殘忍！正因為是這麼奢侈，自然要靠貪汚以歛財，才够他們揮霍了。正因為是這麼殘忍，所以殘民以自肥，自然也便沒有甚麼不忍心的了。</p>
<h3 id="c95">「海之戀」觀後 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 喬龍</p>
<p>目前上海，在舞台劇也如此凋零的時候，居然有一個大歌劇在蘭心演出，的確是很令人興奮的事。</p>
<p>記得純粹的中國歌劇，在上海以前也很少演出。抗戰時，在重慶有過一個「秋子」的演出，但成績不很好。樂藝社以前也有過一個小型的歌劇「上海之歌」演出，但結果因為開支太大而賠了本。本來，一個成形的歌劇的演出，是要動員很大的人力和物力的，在目前中國的這種社會經濟中，的確是一件難事。</p>
<p>「海之戀」的演出，據筆者所知，也可說是一個奇蹟。他們在經濟上根本毫無可靠的支持，光是憑了許多年靑藝人們為藝術而努力的合作和苦幹，來克服了這經濟上的困難。</p>
<p>他們的交饗樂團，是由剛從東北來的淸華交響樂團担任的，且是純盡義務。</p>
<p>「海之戀」的故事，是由羅蒂的「冰島漁夫」改編成的，因此連許多人名都還保留着西洋風味。全劇的演出，也完全仿照意大利歌劇的方式。因為格於物力，所以全劇始終採用一景；每幕的換景只是靠了燈光和音響來爭取效果。燈光設計很成功，可說已是儘了爭取效果的能事；月夜和日出的變換，都有卓絕的技巧表演。</p>
<p>音響，在歌劇的演出上，是佔着很重要的部分的。在這裏，全劇的伴奏，最大的缺點，是缺乏高潮性的表演。全部伴奏，始終保持着那一分平穩性。因為太平穩了，就沒有高與低的對比，因此在劇情緊張時，也不容易使人感到窒息。</p>
<p>樂團的伴奏方面，大體上很不差。但單獨的鋼琴部分似乎用得太多了，當然在處理方面是要簡單不少，但在效果上，除了在伴奏獨白時可以單獨一用外，其他的部分，都宜以交響的和聲來伴奏，比較容易收效。</p>
<p>女主角葉如珍小姐的歌喉很好，音色和音量都足够運用。男主角臧玉琰的聲昔也不差。第二男主角李夢熊的獨唱部分，似乎要差一點，許是詞句的不太適合。扮父親的楊化堂，在定音時，好像太高了一點，跟低音部分不很配合，常使人聽得很累。</p>
<p>不太嚴格的講起來，這是很值得一看的一部歌劇，尤其假如我們能原諒他們經濟情形的限制的話。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Voting Results in the Legislative Yuan: He Yingqin Approved as Premier, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, etc. Return to the Capital <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] The Legislative Yuan successfully passed the motion to approve He Yingqin's succession as Premier of the Executive Yuan during a 75-minute meeting on the afternoon of the 12th. Among the 240 members of the Legislative Yuan who participated in the vote, only 30 voted against. He Yingqin obtained approval from the Legislative Yuan with a majority of 209 votes, with only one invalid ballot. Acting President Li nominated He Yingqin as Premier of the Executive Yuan, and the official letter requesting the Legislative Yuan's approval was delivered to the Legislative Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 12th by a special envoy. At 11:00 AM, Acting President Li hosted a tea party to explain his intentions to all members of the Legislative Yuan, and most legislators expressed their agreement. At 3:35 PM, the Legislative Yuan held its first temporary meeting of the third session to exercise the right of consent. President Tong Guanxian presided over the meeting, read the presidential letter, and then changed the meeting into a plenary review meeting, with Tong Guanxian still serving as chairman. Many members requested to speak. After expressing his agreement, Liang Dong hoped that the new cabinet would carefully select true talent and that the new cabinet members should have a democratic style, a determination to reform, and be thorough in implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. He also hoped that He Yingqin would have a policy direction that conforms to the Principle of People's Livelihood and Democracy in the future. Pan Lianfang believed that in extraordinary times, extraordinary measures should be taken to complete extraordinary tasks. He hoped to abolish personnel relations and idolatry, unite to endure hardship, and reform politics. The assembly believed that the speeches at this time should state the reasons for agreeing or disagreeing, and it was inappropriate to discuss the personnel and policies of the new cabinet. Therefore, it was decided to stop the discussion and reopen the plenary session for voting. Lou Yiwen and 14 others were elected as supervisory committee members. Voting began at 4:10 PM and ended at 4:35 PM. Ballots were counted on the spot, and at 4:50 PM, President Tong announced the voting results. He Yingqin received a total of 209 votes of approval, and the meeting adjourned immediately.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 12th] After celebrating their sixtieth birthday in Hangzhou today, He Yingqin and his wife are scheduled to return to Nanjing tomorrow on the Zhuiyun, a special plane dispatched by Acting President Li, to officially begin forming the cabinet. He Yingqin reported his travel schedule to Acting President Li via long-distance telephone at 9:30 PM tonight. He Yingqin's entourage and relatives are scheduled to return to Nanjing on a special train at 10:30 AM on the 14th.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 12th] Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, Gu Zhutong, and Wei Yongcheng departed from Jianqiao Airport at 11:40 AM this morning on the Meiling special plane to return to Nanjing to report for duty. They carried with them a draft list of the new cabinet, which was compiled after four discussions with He Yingqin, and will first be submitted to Acting President Li.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Bai Chongxi, Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Zhizhong, and Gu Zhutong, who were dispatched by Acting President Li to Hangzhou to urge He Yingqin to return to Nanjing to form a cabinet, returned to Nanjing by plane from Hangzhou at 12:30 PM on the 12th. After disembarking, Bai Chongxi and others went to the Presidential Palace to attend a luncheon hosted by Acting President Li and reported on the process of persuading He Yingqin to form the cabinet. At 6:00 PM, Bai Chongxi visited Cheng Qian and had discussions.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] After Acting President Li's nomination of He Yingqin as the successor to the Premier of the Executive Yuan was approved by the Legislative Yuan by vote on the afternoon of the 12th, people in political circles here reacted very positively. They all believed that He Yingqin was the most suitable candidate for Premier in the current situation. The absolute majority agreement in the Legislative Yuan can also be seen as a symbol of the expected cooperation between the Legislative and Executive branches in the future. They all wish to see the formation of He Yingqin's new cabinet as soon as possible. Regarding the candidates for Vice Premier and heads of various departments, they became the object of speculation from all parties on the 12th. In addition to Gu Mengyu and Huang Shaohong, Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong were also rumored to be candidates for Vice Premier. As for the heads of various departments, it is generally believed that there will be many changes, and only a few people are expected to remain in their positions. However, it is generally believed that Shao Lizi has a high probability of joining the cabinet. A political figure told reporters on the evening of the 12th: The Executive Yuan is a responsible cabinet, and the heads of various departments are responsible to the Premier. When He Yingqin agreed to serve as Premier, he also expressed his advocacy for truly establishing a responsible cabinet system. Acting President Li also expressed his agreement with this view. Therefore, the candidates for Vice Premier and heads of various departments under He Yingqin must be considered by He Yingqin. Even the candidates recommended by Acting President Li must first be discussed with He Yingqin. The person revealed that some of the candidates for the heads of departments had the opportunity to indirectly exchange opinions between Acting President Li and He Yingqin himself when He Yingqin agreed to form the cabinet. There was no excessive discrepancy between the two sides. Once He Yingqin returns to Nanjing from Hangzhou to ask for instructions from Acting President Li, a final decision can be made.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Acting President Li hosted a tea party at the International Friendship Club at noon on the 12th to entertain more than 300 legislators in Nanjing. When he announced that he had invited He Yingqin to serve as Premier of the Executive Yuan and that he would come to Nanjing on the 13th, the entire audience responded with warm applause, which was well received. Acting President Li, accompanied by Chief of Staff Li Hanhun and Adjutant Li Yuqing, first expressed his admiration for the legislators' demands for unity, democracy, and progress. He then explained Sun Ke's firm resignation and retirement, as well as the process of entrusting He Yingqin to form a new cabinet. He said that the most important tasks of the new cabinet were to reorganize the army, reform politics, and strive for peace. He also said that He Yingqin was the most suitable candidate to complete these three tasks. He believed that He Yingqin would respect the Legislative Yuan in the performance of his duties and hoped that the legislators would support him. Finally, he expressed his emotion and gratitude for the legislators' perseverance in coming to Nanjing to attend the meeting despite their hard work and dangers. After the speech, legislator Yang Gongda hoped that the new cabinet would respect the legislature. Zheng Zhenyu said that the most important task at present should be army reorganization and hoped that He Yingqin would thoroughly implement the purpose of army reorganization and pay attention to the selection of the heads of the new cabinet to share the Premier's burden and be responsible for success. Niu Jianchu hoped that the new cabinet could be formed quickly within five days and that it would contact local people more in the future to understand the people's suffering. Zou Shuwen asked the new cabinet to pay attention to the people's livelihood so that the people could live and work in peace and should clearly define responsibilities and powers to facilitate the implementation of government affairs. Finally, Tong Guanxian delivered a reply on behalf of all the legislators, expressing satisfaction with Acting President Li's invitation to He Yingqin to form the cabinet, and hoped that He Yingqin would move forward based on the three major goals of seeking peace, seeking progress, and seeking unity.</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 12th] Today is the sixtieth birthday of General He Yingqin and his wife, Ms. Wang Wenxiang. The Tang Mansion was filled with distinguished guests, and important central officials came to congratulate them. On the eve of He Yingqin's formation of the new cabinet, President Chiang specially wrote the eight characters "Sharing Peace and Danger, Tasting Bitterness Together" as a blessing. Acting President Li, Gu Zhutong, Bai Chongxi. Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Zhizhong, Gu Zhenggang, Tang Enbo, Chen Liang, Zhou Zhirou, and others all sent birthday banners.

<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] When interviewed by a reporter from the French News Agency today, Acting President Li declared: He has great confidence in restoring peace. Acting President Li stressed: The political situation is very good, and the hope of peace is also very high. He said that He Yingqin's cabinet will benefit the unity within the Kuomintang camp. He also said that the members of He's cabinet will stay in Nanjing for a long time in the future, while the subordinate organs of the Executive Yuan will still stay in Guangzhou. Acting President Li refused to comment on US aid.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] The CCP is currently trying to find the greatest propaganda value in the downfall of Sun Ke's cabinet. The Communist Party believes that Sun Ke's resignation is the "failure" of its "Glorious Peace" movement and links this matter with the topic of US interference in China's internal affairs. The Communist Party radio said that US Ambassador Stuart Leiden and four military attachés met with Bai Chongxi to send representatives to Washington to "establish direct contact with military personnel." The current situation is that before the new Executive Yuan is in place, no action can be taken on formally complying with the Communist Party's conditions, and the hope of conducting actual negotiations on March 15 has now disappeared. Even if Li Zongren can immediately have a new cabinet, the new cabinet will have to re-examine the steps already taken at the beginning. In addition to the consistent attacks on the Nanjing government, the Communist Party radio also reports daily on the stories of the Communist Party's efforts to make women, students, workers, and businessmen comply with the Communist Party, and almost every broadcast has a lengthy description of mass rallies and parades. Analysts who pay close attention to the Communist Party's broadcasts believe that the importance of this matter is that it reveals the Communist Party's efforts to gain the support of the people in their occupied areas.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] Liu Luyin flew from Chengdu to Beijing on the 11th and visited Acting President Li Kun that night. It was rumored that Liu might join He Yingqin's new cabinet. Reporters interviewed Liu on the evening of the 12th. According to his statement: He will convey the opinions of the people as an opposition figure. Regarding joining the cabinet, he repeatedly stated that there was no such thing. Liu then strongly emphasized the nationwide people's desire for peace and the importance of peace today, and believed that if open and honest discussions can be carried out, peace will eventually be hopeful. Also, Liu's trip was in response to Acting President Li's call for inquiries and will visit old friends who have been separated for more than ten years and stay in Beijing for a while. Liu's demeanor was graceful, his conversation was humble, and he showed a slight sense of distance from today's political affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e7">He Yingqin Announces Commitment Goals: Establish Political Institutionalization, Seek Peace in Accordance with People's Needs, KMT Central Standing Committee and Political Committee Support He's Cabinet Formation <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 12th] It is reported that He's principle for the selection of the heads of the new cabinet is "using new people and implementing new policies." He will start using some new people to reform China's revolving-door style of politics. On the 12th, reporters from this newspaper visited He Yingqin. He said that the new cabinet's mission is to first meet the needs of the people, seek peace, and devote itself to reforming politics, reorganizing the army, and rectifying the current economic situation. He also accepted the suggestions of local people in Zhejiang Province and will increase the food expenses for soldiers in the future.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 12th] After He Yingqin was ordered to form a cabinet, he decided to make the establishment of political institutionalization and strive to truly achieve the responsible cabinet system as the goal of his efforts. This goal has been unanimously supported by Acting President Li and the central officials, who believe that it is as important as the policies of unity, peace, and reform. He's goal of this effort was reported by Zhang Zhizhong at a banquet held by Acting President Li for the KMT Central Standing Committee members in Nanjing after returning to Nanjing from Hangzhou on the 12th. Zhang said: When he persuaded He Yingqin to form the cabinet in Hangzhou, He Yingqin specifically pointed out that the shortcomings of past politics were that political institutionalization had not been established, powers and responsibilities were unclear, and duties were not separated. He hoped that institutionalization could be established in the future, a responsible cabinet system would be implemented, and a layered responsibility system would be adopted. After Zhang's report, the members spoke and expressed their support for this point. Acting President Li also said that he nominated Mr. He as Premier of the Executive Yuan because he completely trusted Mr. He and decided to enable Mr. He to achieve the responsible cabinet system in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. At noon on the 12th, Acting President Li hosted a banquet for the KMT Central Standing Committee members and the Political Committee members in Nanjing. He first reported that Sun Ke's resignation had been approved and that he had nominated He Yingqin as Premier of the Executive Yuan. According to the Constitution, the President's nomination of the Premier of the Executive Yuan is a power granted by the Constitution, but in accordance with the political parties and the KMT's practice, it should first be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for approval. However, since the Central Party Headquarters has moved to Guangzhou, the Central Standing Committee cannot be held. As an expedient measure, in addition to having telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters in Guangzhou on the morning of the 12th to request the completion of the approval procedures, he specially invited the Central Standing Committee members to solicit opinions this afternoon, hoping to give their consent. Subsequently, Wu Zhongxin and Zhang Zhizhong, who had just returned to Beijing from Hangzhou, reported on the process of persuading He Yingqin to form a cabinet in Hangzhou with Bai Chongxi and Gu Zhutong. According to Wu and Zhang, He Yingqin repeatedly declined, saying that the current situation was difficult and the financial and economic difficulties were heavy, and he was deeply afraid that he would not be able to do the job. However, after being held accountable by the four on the grounds of righteousness, Bai Chongxi also expressed to He Yingqin that under the current circumstances, only He could bear this important task, and all parties absolutely unanimously supported He. Finally, He reluctantly agreed to do his best. After Wu and Zhang finished their reports, the members stood up and spoke, unanimously agreeing that He should take office as Premier of the Executive Yuan and accept Acting President Li's nomination. They also unanimously advocated that unity, peace, and reform should be sought in the future, and that the army, personnel, and agencies should be streamlined. Cheng Qian was also invited to attend the meeting. He stood up and said that as a local official, he would support Mr. He. Zhang Qun said that although the current situation is very difficult, it is not irredeemable. Taking the flight of an airplane as an example, flying against the wind can fly higher. Mr. He's formation of the cabinet in a difficult situation can better show his contribution. Yu Youren also stood up and said that today is Mr. He's birthday, and he has also been ordered to form a cabinet. At the same time, it is also Mr. Cheng Songyun's birthday, so he specially raised his glass to celebrate. The atmosphere at the meeting was harmonious. More than 20 members who attended the meeting were pleased with the formation of the cabinet and spoke enthusiastically until the meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM. The Central Standing Committee members who were invited to the banquet on the 12th included Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Zhizhong, Bai Chongxi, Wu Zhongxin, Zhu Jiahua, and Shao Lizi.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Sun Ke and His Wife Arrive in Shanghai, Will Go to Guangzhou for a Short Rest in Three or Four Days, Said Stabilizing Prices Depends on the Realization of Peace <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Sun Ke and his wife arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death—the 12th. Later, Sun met with reporters and said that apart from expressing his grief in silence, there were no other actions at home. Next, Sun answered questions about the current situation. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) I may go to Guangzhou in three or four days. In the future, I will take a short rest and use my spare time to read books related to world affairs, but I do not plan to write a memoir. I have no intention of accepting the position of acting chairman of the Political Council. (2) There are many difficulties in the peace talks, and the formal start is still to be determined. In my personal view, the basic difficulty is that the degree of understanding between the KMT and the Communist Party is too shallow, and the suspicion has not been eliminated. When talking about the issue of army reorganization, there is a need for this in terms of finance. As for the actual difficulties of army reorganization in the process of peace talks, I can only ask the new Premier of the Executive Yuan to answer. (3) It is rumored that the CCP requires control of Beijing and Shanghai as a prerequisite for peace talks. This is a matter for the future and is difficult to achieve. Regarding the content of the peace plan, Sun firmly refused to disclose it, believing that it would hinder the peace talks and be detrimental to the country. (4) After the CCP controls China, our country will inevitably tend to the Soviet Union bloc, but from the perspective of the people, China should not be anti-American or anti-Soviet. In this way, even if there are no new conflicts in the world in the future, our country can stay out of it. Otherwise, our country will suffer war again, and the sacrifices will be so heavy that they will be difficult to recover in a century. In the future, China should not be drawn into other disputes, except to resist foreign military aggression. (5) There are no major mistakes in the past foreign policy of the National Government, but it has not been effective. This is due to the deterioration of the post-war world situation in which countries are competing for hegemony. We cannot do anything about it and cannot bear this responsibility. As far as the US policy towards China is concerned, the past aid to China was to use our country as a tool, and I personally do not agree with it. (6) Political reform must wait for the realization of peace before it can be effectively carried out. As for the Kuomintang itself, it should review its mistakes and resolutely correct its past mistakes before there is hope of revival. (7) The current problems of prices and finance can only be stabilized if peace is realized. Because only after peace can we talk about reducing the army and economizing on government expenditures. With our country's wealth, we can at least maintain one million regular troops in peacetime, but at present, the armed forces of both sides are more than six or seven million? In the past, I advocated reducing the army to 2.5 million, but the military authorities believed that it was impossible to do so. Even the United States, with its wealth, maintains only 1.5 million soldiers in the army, navy, and air force during the Cold War.</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Type of Peiping <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>The author is the president of a newspaper and an evening paper in Peiping. During the "localized peace" period in Peiping, both his daily and evening papers were suspended. He originally planned to stay in Peiping. On the 20th of last month, he resolutely left Peiping, traveled along the Jinpu Railway to Jinan, then from Jinan to Qingdao, and arrived in Shanghai by ship at the beginning of this month. He wrote this article partly to commemorate the days he spent and partly to make the public truly understand Peiping as it is now.</p>
<p>"Localized peace means surrender." Yan Xishan once said this. Peiping has now achieved localized peace. The facts of the peace in Peiping prove that this statement is correct. Fu Zuoyi may regret making this move today, but the environment and general situation at the time he made this move also played a part. Without understanding the events before and after the peace talks in Peiping, one cannot understand the truth behind Peiping's achievement of localized peace.</p>
<p>After the government retreated from Changpan and failed in the Northeast, Fu Zuoyi, in his senior cadre meeting, reviewed the failure of the Northeast war and openly criticized the Northeast National Army for "losing without a fight." He confidently told his cadres that if Lin Biao entered the Pass with ten columns, he could withstand it and would give the Communist army a severe blow on the plains of North China. From his military deployments, successively and automatically withdrawing from Qinhuangdao, Huludao, Chengde, Baoding, Zhuozhou, and Tongzhou, shortening the front lines, and concentrating forces, it can be seen that he was working to coordinate with this plan and earnestly hoping to defend Peiping and Tianjin.</p>
<p>According to rumored estimates, after Lin Biao entered the Pass, there would be a major battle in eastern Hebei. Therefore, the forces from Tangshan to Tanggu and Tianjin were greatly strengthened. At the same time, Shi Jue's Ninth Army Group was concentrated in the Miyun and Tongzhou areas to deal with this situation. However, the actions of Lin Biao's troops did not conform to his wishful thinking. After eating up four regiments of Shi Jue's troops in Miyun, they scurried to the Ping-Sui Railway and the northern Chahar area, using a portion of their forces to cut off the Ping-Sui Railway, surround Peiping and Tianjin in a feigned attack, while another portion of their forces occupied the commanding heights of the western suburbs of Peiping - Nankou, advancing westward to join with Nie Rongzhen's forces, and attacking Fu Zuoyi's basic 35th Army and Provisional 3rd Army in northern Chahar. First, they surrounded the 35th Army. The Provisional 3rd Army, in order to rescue the 35th Army, launched a counter-encirclement, which gave the 35th Army a breather, but the Provisional 3rd Army was surrounded by the Communist army. Fortunately, An Chunshan, the commander of the Provisional 3rd Army, was a clever and capable general who broke through the encirclement, but the troops were somewhat routed. An Chunshan himself was captured, disguised as a cook, and escaped without being discovered. Later, An Chunshan successively gathered his old troops, and about two-thirds of them escaped, and they were reorganized into the 104th Army, which is now in Peiping City, jointly responsible for security duties. An Chunshan was a general who rose from the ranks, rich in revolutionary ideas, and Fu Zuoyi relied on him as his right-hand man. When An's whereabouts were unknown, Fu was very anxious! Later, when An escaped to Peiping, Fu met with him and held his hand, expressing indescribable joy.</p>
<p>This was Fu Zuoyi's biggest misstep! This move not only had a great impact on Fu Zuoyi's personal success or failure, but also had a very significant impact on the development of the situation in North China, and even on China's future! Originally, Fu Zuoyi had already decided to withdraw from Zhangjiakou and concentrate his own basic troops in Peiping and Tianjin to participate in the defense of Peiping and Tianjin. However, because Fu Zuoyi had personally returned to Zhangjiakou and met with the speaker of the Chahar Provincial Council for a long talk of three hours, the speaker naturally listed many sufficient reasons, explaining that Zhangjiakou should not be withdrawn from and earnestly requested that Zhangjiakou not be abandoned. Man is an emotional animal, and Fu Zuoyi, who started his career in Chahar and Suiyuan, was affected by this emotional impulse and agreed not to withdraw from Zhangjiakou. This wrong decision not only destroyed Zhangjiakou, destroyed Fu Zuoyi himself, but also destroyed the overall situation in North China! Since Zhangjiakou was not withdrawn from, Fu's basic troops, such as the 35th Army, the Provisional 3rd Army, the Provisional 4th Army, and several cavalry brigades, were stationed in Zhangjiakou and the northern Chahar area and were not transferred back to Peiping and Tianjin. Nie Rongzhen's troops were originally completely concentrated in northern Chahar, plus the new artillery and elite troops that Lin Biao had transferred from outside the Pass, they jointly attacked the 35th Army stationed in Xinbaoan. The 35th Army was indeed a brave and well-trained elite force, with a long-standing reputation in North China. However, due to a delay of two hours in action, and the Communist army's artillery fire was so fierce that people could not lift their heads, the deaths piled up, and the battle situation was tragic! Guo Jingyun, the commander of the 35th Army, was also killed in action. After the fall of Xinbaoan, Zhangjiakou lost its barrier, so Zhangjiakou immediately became agitated and entered a state of chaos. Xinbaoan fell at three or four o'clock that afternoon, and Zhangjiakou decided to withdraw that evening. However, with so many agencies in Chahar Province, as well as the troops of the Provisional 4th Army, it was naturally chaotic to order a retreat at once! Moreover, the terrain of Zhangjiakou is a basin surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the main road to the west is a passage between two mountains. If the Communist army occupied the mountains and attacked, it goes without saying! The reports in the newspapers that the agencies and factories in Zhangjiakou were registered and handed over were not true!</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou was eventually lost, and Fu Zuoyi's basic troops were sacrificed for him! This wrong decision had an even greater impact later, which was on the development of the defense of Peiping and Tianjin. Fu Zuoyi walked around the room in anxiety over this matter and slapped himself in the face.</p>
<p>After the problems of Zhangjiakou and northern Chahar were resolved, the Communist army transferred the forces from the Zhangjiakou area to Peiping and Tianjin. Nie Rongzhen's six columns were reorganized into two army groups, and Lin Biao's three columns were left to form one army group. These three army groups besieged Peiping. The remaining troops under Lin Biao originally in the suburbs of Peiping were transferred to the outskirts of Tianjin and began to attack Tianjin, estimated to be more than eight columns. The main force of the Communist army's attack on Tianjin was concentrated on the west gate, and the battle situation was extremely tragic! They fell one after another, and the deaths numbered in the tens of thousands; however, they finally broke through one point and entered the urban area. In the basement of the garrison headquarters, they captured Chen Changjie, the defending commander who was directing the battle, and forced him to order a ceasefire, thus ending the artillery fire in Tianjin.

<h3 id="e14">Weekly Forum: A Humble Proposal for Stabilizing Prices Through Cooperative Organizations <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Miancheng</p>
<p>The government has repeatedly carried out financial and economic reforms in the past six months, but prices have ultimately failed to stabilize, which is truly regrettable. How to make price trends slightly more stable and prevent production and sales from stagnating, or even causing the phenomenon of material flight and reverse flow, urgently requires supplementary institutionalized and rationalized measures. Now that the central political situation is being renewed, and General He Yingqin has been ordered to form a cabinet and strongly praises the social policies of the British Labour Party, I believe that the current economic system must undergo considerable reform, and cooperative organizations can exert a great function in price stabilization work. Now, I specially propose ten key points, to seek advice from the wise men of the world.</p>
<p>(1) Universally establish consumer cooperatives to allocate daily necessities. The types and quantities of these allocated goods can be stipulated separately according to the local production and supply and demand situation. However, in principle, it should start with cities first and should be limited to a small number of items, such as five types: grain, cloth, edible salt, cooking oil, and fuel. Among them, cloth can be limited to one or two types. All items that are subject to allocation must be completely handed over to the comprehensive consumer cooperatives in each city, which are responsible for allocation with vouchers, and cannot be distributed by stores at the same time. Where there are no cooperatives, they should be urged to be established immediately, and subsidies should be provided for housing and equipment. Since the government's purpose is to stabilize prices for the people and establish a new economic system, this temporary expenditure should not be haggled over. The population should be jointly agreed upon by the government and the cooperative. If, due to factual needs, this allocation price must be set below cost, the losses will be subsidized by the government. Efforts should be made to ensure that the agreed price does not fluctuate at any time. As for the current method of selling off materials, it is often used by speculators, and the true purpose of price stabilization is not fully achieved, so it is necessary to improve it.</p>
<p>(2) Simultaneously establish production and marketing cooperatives to centralize materials. The premise of allocation is materials. In the past, the government's policy of purchasing materials either set prices too low, making it impossible for producers to recover costs and reducing production, or concentrated purchases by manufacturers in a short period of time, causing prices to rise, while production areas were subject to controls, resulting in higher prices in production areas than in sales areas, and goods flowed exclusively to the capital. Start with production control; at the same time, cooperative societies shall jointly establish warehouses, or the government shall establish warehouses, to store the products of each society. The quantity of products of each society and the warehouse where they are stored shall be reported and registered with the government, and the government shall send personnel to check the items stored in each warehouse, and shall not be transferred without the consent of the government. The prices at which the government purchases products from the societies shall be jointly agreed upon by the government and representatives of the cooperative societies, based on the principles of cost and legitimate profit, and the exchange system of industrial and agricultural products shall be promoted. For example: the purchase of grain can be paid with cloth, in order to promote the farmers' willingness to pay grain. The above five types of allocated goods now have their own institutions responsible for special management. If cooperative organizations can be established at the grassroots level to coordinate and promote with government agencies, and a complete system of production, marketing and distribution can be established, it will surely achieve effective price stabilization.</p>
<p>(3) Control the factories that produce allocated goods and统筹manage them. Large-scale yarn mills and cloth factories are now partly controlled by the government. The scope of control should be further expanded to increase the source of materials. In addition, the larger-scale oil mills should also be controlled by the government. Some coal mines are already under government control, and the scope of control should also be expanded to facilitate allocation business. For factories under government control, the government shall protect the reasonable rights and interests of the factories, and the term of control may be specified in the contract. The original responsible personnel should still stay in the factory to work, and the government should appoint senior officials to supervise them. The products of each factory can be designated to be delivered to a certain cooperative society in a certain place for allocation, or sent to a designated warehouse first, and then allocated to each cooperative society by the government.</p>
<p>(4) Implement thrifty consumption to indirectly increase materials. In order to ensure that there is no shortage of allocated materials, in addition to increasing production, consumption should also be saved to alleviate poverty. In the past, advocating thrift often had little effect. If cooperative methods can be used, it will be easier to promote. For example, promoting cooperative canteens will definitely save grain and fuel. Promoting housing cooperatives will definitely save housing and building materials and appliances. Promoting vehicle cooperation will definitely save gasoline. The principle is very clear.</p>
<p>(5) Strengthen export trade to balance foreign exchange revenue and expenditure. In order to increase production and stabilize prices, it is impossible not to use imported equipment, raw materials and goods at all. However, in order to maintain the foreign exchange balance, these imported goods must be exchanged with export goods. At present, most of China's export goods are agricultural products. Whether the export of agricultural products can be increased depends entirely on whether their production can be increased, whether their quality can be improved, and whether their marketing technology can be improved. In order to achieve this goal, there must be production, marketing and processing cooperative organizations for exporting agricultural products, and large-scale cooperative organizations should be adopted in order to generate concrete effects. After reaching the export destination, either the government can collect and sell them uniformly, or encourage cooperative societies to handle exports. However, if the collection and sales are unified, the price must not be limited too low to protect the legitimate interests of the people. At present, there are already many cooperative products for exporting agricultural products, such as tea, tung oil, peanuts, ramie, etc. In addition, there are some handicrafts that can also be encouraged to be exported through cooperation, and they already have a considerable foundation. In the past, encouraging exports focused on foreign exchange prices, but it should actually start from production and marketing, which is the fundamental solution. Therefore, cooperative organizations are extremely important. (Continued on page 4)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Prelude to a Large-Scale Crossing-the-Yangtze Offensive? The Communist Army in Southern Henan Points Towards Eastern Hubei. The National Army Along the River Has Adopted Strict Precautions. <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Xinyang on the 12th] Military news: (1) According to air force reconnaissance reports: About five regiments of Liu Bocheng's troops of the Communist army, which marched north from Xincai, crossed Huangchuan on the 11th and marched towards eastern Hubei. The National Army's strong troops stationed along the Yangtze River line in Qichun and its periphery have adopted strict precautions. The two regiments of the Communist army stationed inside and outside Huangchuan city and the more than 1,000 local Communists who have scurried to the south bank of the Huai River and are constantly providing reinforcements to Luoshan may be attempting to cover their subsequent troops to continue south. According to a certain military authority who told reporters: The Communist army is now actively preparing to cross the Yangtze River in the upper and lower reaches. At this time, it is noteworthy that it is using a part of its troops in southeastern Henan to meander south, concentrating its forces on both sides of the Huai River on the east side of the Ping-Han Railway, in order to test the strength of the National Army in eastern Hubei along the Yangtze River in the hinterland of southern Henan. However, this action by the Communist army has just begun, and the military here has already anticipated it and prepared for it. From this point of view, it seems impossible for the Communist army to take the lead in launching a large-scale crossing-the-Yangtze offensive in the Central China theater. (2) The actions of the Communist army on the east side of the Ping-Han Railway, and the "anti-persecution" movement launched by 100,000 Red Spear Society members (i.e., the Red Spear Society) west of the railway against the Communist army in various parts of the Tongbai Mountain area, have aroused great attention from the military and civilians here. Local people in Henan Province have now launched a fundraising campaign to provide relief and condolences to the Red Spear Society members and refugees who were killed and injured in Xinyang and Tongbai counties. Many people have spontaneously donated money. (3) Chairman Zhang Zhen told reporters today that he is very concerned about the fact that the people of southern Henan have clashed with the Communist army in various places in order to protect their own interests, resulting in continuous bloodshed. In addition to issuing a notice to all counties to exempt those who participate in the people's self-defense training from military service, and to exempt them from some of their ancestral obligations, he also issued a handwritten order to the military and political responsible agencies in his jurisdiction to be strictly on guard, because in this "people's century," it is difficult for those who violate the interests of the people to survive.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Xinyang on the 12th] (1) More than 10,000 people from the Second Column of Liu Bocheng's troops continued to forcibly cross the Huai River north of Huangchuan and invaded south. The National Army's air force had no choice but to dispatch bombing raids, but the Communist army still ventured to attack. At the moment, its vanguard troops have scurried to the south of Huangchuan. Also, a part of the Communist army of about 200 people north of Luoshan has been surrounded by the National Army and can be completely wiped out immediately. (2) More than 2,000 Communist troops were discovered near Xingzhaiji, east of Zhengyang, and were repelled by the National Army, and many puppet county heads and officials were captured.

<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Xinyang on the 10th] (Delayed) The Red Spear Society (also known as the People's Self-Defense Force), which was launched by the people of 28 counties in southern Henan to "demand peace through armed struggle," has become increasingly powerful since it captured Tongbai County on the morning of the 9th. According to news on the morning of the 10th: The Red Spear Society members in Tanghe, Nanyang, Dengxian, Zhenping, Biyang, Zhengyang, Runan, and Suixian and Zao yang in northern Hubei have responded in large numbers. Its armed members have exceeded 100,000. When they march, they still use a large red silk flag or a red cloth flag as a guide, followed by a copper incense burner filled with sandalwood, carried by two or four people, mixed in the ranks. Behind them, they also carry ancient-style instruments of torture, such as the copper guillotine used by Bao Wencheng in the Song Dynasty, in order to be able to pronounce sentences from time to time when capturing elements who violate the interests of the people. Some armed people carrying rifles and holding red-tasseled spears sang loudly and rushed forward,簇拥crowding the copper furnace with its lingering smoke. This monotheistic people's armed force is giving a boost to the local Communists in various parts of southern Henan.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Financial Difficulties in Jiangxi <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Export of Rice Has Not Yet Been Lifted; The Central Cooperative's Plan to Purchase Grain in Shanghai Has Been Shelved.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Nanchang on the 12th] The provincial finances after the promulgation of the new financial reform plan must be implemented from July. For the provincial expenses in March and June, the central government will still subsidize 70%. However, at present, Jiangxi's finances are feeling very difficult due to the lack of funds in the Central Bank, and the central government's payment orders cannot be allocated on time due to the vast expenditures of the national treasury. For example, the 60-fold increase in the new treatment for Jiangxi's public educators in February has not yet been issued, and a portion must be raised and issued again in March to maintain their livelihood. At present, the provincial-level staff's salaries for March may be advanced in part next week. In addition to explaining the recent provincial administration at a press conference on the 12th, Chairman Fang Tian also stated that Jiangxi rice has not yet been decontrolled. The Central Cooperative's plan to purchase grain on behalf of the Shanghai People's Food Association, more than 30,000 dans, cannot be shipped out.</p>

<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 12th] The Provincial Security Department released the battle situation in northern Jiangsu for the past week on the 12th: The main force of the Communist army's field army in northern Jiangsu is actively pressing close to the edge of the Yangtze River, and the rear transportation is frequent. It is estimated that the Tenth Column, originally stationed in the Shaobo-Xiannü Temple area, has begun to move east in recent days. The Eleventh Column is still stationed in the Rugao-Nantong area, and the Twelfth Column is stationed in the Taixing-Jingjiang area. In the past week, it has been discovered that its Fourth, Ninth, and Thirteenth Columns seem to have also transferred to the Taixian-Taixing-Jingjiang area. Whether this is the case is currently being urgently investigated to collect materials to confirm it. In total, the field army and local teams of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu do not number less than 100,000. Chen Yi's inspection of various places in Jiangbei and Su Yu's quasi-residence in Taixing seem to be clear evidence of their intention to reorganize and cross the Yangtze River.</p>

<h3 id="e21">A Sudden Increase in Outbound Passengers from Taiwan. The Joint Statement of the Speakers of All Counties and Cities States that the Request to Limit Population and Entry Is Not Xenophobic. <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] A sudden increase in outbound passengers from Taiwan Province. The more than 2,000 cabins of the Zhongxing Wheel sailing to Shanghai on the 12th have recently been completely sold out. Due to overcrowding, the China Aviation Company's Taiwan-Shanghai flights have suspended registration since the 11th. Tickets for the Central Aviation Company's flights to Shanghai also need to be purchased after a week. This batch of departing passengers will not return to the mainland in the short term. Since the mainland Province implemented the entry permit on March 1, only more than 400 people have been approved to enter the country after passing the review. Therefore, this batch of departing passengers from Taiwan Province has almost no intention of returning to Taiwan. According to statistics, in the past two or three months, there have been more inbound passengers than outbound passengers to Taiwan Province, and housing and prices have been directly affected. Since the implementation of the entry registration certificate, the number of inbound passengers has decreased sharply, with only more than 100 or even more than 10 people per ship. Recently, some people have been brewing to abolish the entry permit method. However, the speakers of all county and city councils in Taiwan Province have jointly issued a written statement, saying, "Limiting the entry of population is the demand of the people of Taiwan. Since the restoration, everyone has been very welcome to people from the motherland to Taiwan to guide the work of reviving and building the country. In the past few years, Taiwan has made progress as a result of the assistance of many people. However, in recent years, due to the instability on the mainland, we should welcome people coming to Taiwan in large numbers. All people within the four seas are brothers. Moreover, the people of the mainland Province and the people of Taiwan share the same bloodline. What is the difference between them? However, due to the sharp increase in population, a food and housing panic has occurred, which is quite easy to cause social chaos and stimulate prices. Nowadays, the price of rice in Taiwan, which produces rice, is still higher than on the mainland. In order to maintain the stability of the country, we have to ask the government to take temporary expedient measures. It is a matter of utmost importance and is not xenophobic or has any other meaning."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The financial reform plan stipulates that people are allowed to freely trade gold and silver. The Central Bank may also buy and sell gold and silver to stabilize the market price. However, if general silver and money firms are allowed to purchase and sell gold and silver in large quantities, whether for value preservation or profit-making purposes, it is not in line with the proper course of business operations. In order to implement the policy of stabilizing finance, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that banks, except those with special permits, are still not allowed to sell raw gold and silver. Those who violate this regulation will be punished according to the relevant provisions of the Banking Law. As for the short-term gold public bonds issued by the government in the 38th year, which are valuable securities, silver and money firms, within the scope of their approved business by the Ministry, can buy and sell valuable securities, and they are naturally allowed to buy and sell gold public bonds. However, after winning the lottery at maturity, they should report the gold obtained from the repayment of principal and interest, as well as subsequent transfers, to the Ministry of Finance for record.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The State Department announced that as a result of Secretary of State Acheson's meeting with the ambassadors of seven countries yesterday, some details of the North Atlantic Treaty have been clarified. The ambassadors of the seven countries will continue to visit Acheson next week to discuss the signing ceremony and notify the US government of the ratification by their respective governments.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] Well-informed sources confirmed tonight that the foreign ministers of the five Western Union nations are scheduled to travel to the United States on the "Queen Mary" from Southampton on the 26th of this month to attend the signing ceremony of the Atlantic Treaty, which is expected to take place around April 4th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] At the request of the French government, the full text of the Atlantic Treaty has been postponed until next Friday. Another meeting will be held next week, at which the Italian ambassador to the United States may also attend. It is also learned that another issue most valued by the negotiators of the treaty is the declaration to be issued by Britain, the United States, and France regarding Turkey, Greece, and Iran. Although these countries are not participating in the Atlantic Treaty, they have all received US military assistance, the nature of which is equivalent to the military assistance that the United States will provide to the countries of the Atlantic Treaty. Therefore, it is necessary to issue a declaration to clarify the nature of military assistance to Greece, Turkey, and other countries. At the same time, the representatives of Greece, Turkey, and other countries also believe that any security system that does not take into account the status of the Eastern Mediterranean countries is incomplete.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen met with Acheson for more than an hour today to discuss the details of the Atlantic Treaty. Afterwards, Rasmussen told reporters that the talks were only preliminary in nature and that he would need to continue talks with Acheson before leaving the United States.

Rasmussen also revealed that he had explained the political situation in Denmark to Acheson in detail, and also discussed relations with Norway.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Debate on Participation in the Western Treaty in the Italian Parliament is Fierce; Special Meeting Convened Today for Final Vote; Communists Incite Strikes to Protest Government Decisions <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 12th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi will convene a special meeting of Congress tomorrow, attempting to counter the Communist Party's efforts to incite public opinion against Italy's participation in the Atlantic Pact. Communist leaders ordered a strike on the 12th and will hold a demonstration on the 23rd to protest the government's "war policy." Within hours of this move, De Gasperi decided to bring forward the debate and urge Parliament to vote on the issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 11th] The Italian Parliament discussed the Atlantic Treaty today, and the debate was fierce. A motion proposed by Nenni, the leader of the majority Socialist Party who is pro-Communist, was rejected by a vote of 311 to 165, and the government won safely. Nenni's motion requested the government to explain in detail to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Congress the tasks undertaken by Italy under the treaty. Prime Minister De Gasperi spoke first, arguing that joining the treaty was another guarantee against war and did not ask Italy to undertake any matters beyond its defense capabilities. Italy's strategic position unfortunately has international value, so it will do its best to seek peace. De Gasperi then briefly outlined Italy's foreign policy, saying that Italy is now paying close attention to the customs union with France and the creation of a European parliament. Regarding the peace treaty, De Gasperi said that Italy has not asked for it to be revised, and now it is only waiting for Italy's requests to be fulfilled in a peaceful atmosphere. De Gasperi concluded by praising the various achievements made by the government in the country. After the Prime Minister's speech, Nenni took the floor, saying that the government's proposal to join the Atlantic Treaty was even more serious than the Mussolini government's decision to join the Axis Pact in 1939. Communist leader Togliatti also strongly criticized the treaty, saying that it would divide the world into two, and that the treaty would put Italy on the road to disaster, and hoped that the government would continue to clarify it. Then Foreign Minister Sforza rose to answer, saying that there were no secret documents attached to the treaty, nor were there any conspiracies, and that the negotiations were conducted openly. After the Foreign Minister's reply, the Prime Minister returned to the podium to declare his intention to inform the members of Congress of all the contents of the treaty, and emphasized that according to the Constitution, the government can negotiate the treaty first, and then submit it to Congress for debate. Now, for the first time in Italian history, the Congress is asked to give the government its trust before negotiating the treaty. At this point, Nenni's motion was put to a vote and rejected by a majority.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] French General Giraud, who had experienced two world wars, passed away in the Army Hospital of Dijon tonight at the age of seventy.

<h3 id="e42">Despair in Resolving the Dispute Between the Four Powers; New Currency to Be Issued in West Berlin <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 11th] Responsible authorities have announced that the United States, Britain, and France have decided to adopt a new financial plan in West Berlin in order to drive the East German Mark issued by the Soviet Union out of West Berlin. This move will clarify the financial chaos caused by the competition between the two Marks in West Berlin and can promote industrial production. The new monetary system can be announced immediately, stipulating that the "Clay Mark" is the only currency in West Berlin. The currency issue was originally the main dispute in the Soviet blockade of Berlin, and the announcement of this move by the West is sufficient to indicate that the path to a negotiated solution has been declared hopeless.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Public Utilities Price Base to be Reviewed and Announced This Afternoon; Representatives at the Meeting Vigorously Argued with the Heads of Various Companies Yesterday; Dividend Issue Becomes Focus of Dispute <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the Municipal Council decided to adjust the prices of public utilities based on the multiple of the cost of living index, the base of each item will be announced this afternoon. The principle for reviewing and finalizing the base was decided yesterday. The Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Municipal Council is scheduled to hold a temporary meeting at 3:00 PM today in the Council Meeting Room to discuss and decide on the base of public utilities before announcing it. The new method will be implemented after the cost of living index for employees in the city is released the day after tomorrow (the 15th).</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiang Haoran, Li Wenjie, Zhu Fuju, Yu Shun, He Yuanming and other representatives of the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Municipal Council, together with the heads of major public utilities companies in the city, spent the entire day conducting the work of reviewing and finalizing the base on the fourth floor of the Municipal Bank. The meeting started at 10:00 AM and did not end until after 5:00 PM. It is reported that the meeting was tense and heated throughout, and there was no time to rest even for lunch. The representatives of the Council and the company authorities argued fiercely, and there were several times when they could not agree, so the base could not be finalized smoothly yesterday. According to reporter's inquiries: The focus of the dispute is on the dividend issue. According to the decision of the previous Public Utilities Subcommittee meeting, in this time of crisis, any enterprise should prioritize service. The dividend item of each company should be temporarily removed, while the company insisted that dividends must be included in order to maintain the enterprise. As for the base item, both parties agreed to use the "August 19" price as the basis, which is the base price announced by each public utility when priced in Customs Gold Units for the previous time. The reason why they could not agree is that the Council believes that after the dividend is removed, the base should be reduced according to the original base price, while the company, in addition to insisting on not accepting the removal of dividends, stated that its base should be appropriately increased compared to the original base price. They believe that if the prices of public utilities are priced in Customs Gold Units, they can be adjusted daily according to the US dollar. Now that the method has been changed to adjust according to the cost of living index, the company can only increase prices twice a month. In order to compensate for the loss, they firmly insist that the base must be increased, which has resulted in a large gap between the two parties on reviewing and finalizing the base, which ultimately prevented the meeting from having concrete results yesterday.</p>
<p>In order to take care of the burden on citizens, the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Municipal Council will insist on minimizing the base of public utilities as much as possible, so it has decided to convene a temporary meeting this afternoon to study it again and make a final decision. The issue of adjusting the prices of public utilities, which is of most concern to citizens throughout the city, should have concrete results today.</p>

<p>Citizens Feel Very Confused About This</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the method of pricing public utilities in Customs Gold Units was cancelled by the Municipal Council, most stores and households in the city have received water, electricity, and telephone bills from various companies one after another, which list the prices calculated in Customs Gold Units, and require payment within a time limit. Otherwise, the overdue difference will be recovered or the electricity will be cut off. Citizens feel very confused about this and do not know whether to pay immediately or refuse to pay. They hope that the Municipal Council and the public utilities authorities will provide clear instructions.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the case of Hao Mengru, a female employee of the Central Trust Bureau, being defrauded of 220 piculs of white japonica rice by Zhou Zheng, who falsely set up a "China Engineering Company," Judge Ye Guiling of the District Court sentenced the defendant to seven months in prison yesterday. The other two defendants, Pan Yu and He Ruitang, were both declared not guilty. The plaintiff in the case, Hao Mengru, intended to build a three-story western-style house on Bao'an Road on September 17 last year. The defendant fabricated the name of a "China Engineering Company" and contracted to Hao, with the total price set at 390 piculs of superior white japonica rice, with 220 piculs paid in advance, equivalent to 4,400 Customs Gold Units.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Xujiahui Police Sub-Bureau received a report the day before yesterday that unscrupulous discharged soldiers were using "proof" documents with inscriptions from important people to forcibly sell crude paintings and calligraphy to manufacturers and residents in the area under its jurisdiction and extort money. After Chen, the sub-bureau chief, sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts, he arrested eight current offenders who were forcibly selling and extorting money in the Shanghai Marble Factory at No. 554, Hongqiao Road, Xujiahui yesterday afternoon. On the spot, they seized a note that read, "Limit five minutes to send all the things, otherwise it will be unfavorable to you." In addition, there was a "proof paper" with inscriptions from Li Zongren, Shao Lizi, Hong Lanyou, Bai Yunti, Xu Kan, Pan Gongzhan, and others. Among the offenders, two were wearing Army Major General uniforms, one named Zhang Hongbin, claiming to be a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and the other named Dai Qian. One was a Lieutenant Colonel, named Huang Wende. One was a Major, named Huang Hua. One was a Lieutenant, named Zhang Miaocheng. One was wearing an Air Force uniform, named Ye Yucheng, claiming to be the flying pilot of the third detachment of the first squadron of the Taiwan Air Force. One was wearing a police uniform, named Mei Guangzheng, claiming to be a patrol officer of the Suzhou North District Sub-Bureau. Another person was wearing plain clothes, named Jiang Xinhou. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, they confessed that they had gone to the Shanghai Marble Factory on the 11th to sell paintings and calligraphy worth 40,000 yuan. Later, because they felt that the money was not enough to cover the cost, they went again today (the 12th) to ask the factory to increase the amount appropriately. Later, after a detailed investigation by the bureau, it was discovered that Dai Qian and Jiang Xinshi had committed many theft cases before and had been sentenced to imprisonment by the Garrison Command and the court. Chen, the sub-bureau chief, reported to Director Mao of the General Bureau and requested instructions on how to deal with them. After Mao received the report, he was furious and immediately ordered Gan Jue, the chief of the Detective Section, to transfer the above-mentioned offenders to the General Bureau for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Instigator of the Plane Hijacking to the Communists Turns Out to Be a Civil Aviation Administration Employee: Xing Guozheng, Former Deputy Director of the Control Tower at Longhua Airport <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The inside story of China Airlines flight 135, a Shanghai-Qingdao flight that mysteriously landed in Jinan, a Communist-controlled area, has gradually come to light since the return of the three crew members to Shanghai. The plane was forced to change course mid-flight by a group of passengers with guns. There were five male hijackers, one female, and one infant. According to confirmations gathered by our reporters from various sources, these individuals were not Communist personnel, but a group instigated by an employee of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation. The leader was named Xing Guozheng, formerly the deputy director of the air traffic control station at Longhua Airport, who had served in the Air Force for a considerable time. He was later sent to the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration to study air traffic control and returned to China to assume the position of deputy director of the control station at Longhua.</p>
<p>Impression of Xing Guozheng</p>
<p>On December 15, 1947, the local edition of this newspaper published a feature story about the air traffic control station, the material for which was provided by Xing. He was quite young, estimated to be under thirty years old. The reporter recalls the conversations with him at Longhua, finding him quite energetic, though he seemed somewhat impatient. At that time, he was assisting Xu Bingxie, the head of the station, and even introduced the reporter to him. A few months later, it was heard that he had been transferred to Guangzhou, and no further news was heard of him since. More than a year later, it is unexpected that he would hijack a plane to join the Communists.</p>
<p>Names of the Six People</p>
<p>It is reported that on the day of the incident, after placing the pilot, co-pilot, and radio operator under surveillance, Xing took over the controls. However, due to unfamiliarity with the performance of the C47 aircraft, he was unable to land it. In the end, he forced the co-pilot to land the plane safely. In addition to Xing Guozheng, the names of the others who participated in the hijacking and are currently staying in Jinan, as discovered by our reporter, are as follows: Chen Tiesheng, Hua Xinghang, Mou Huanhai, Liu Shurong, Liu Jiying (female), and Liu Didi (infant). As for the reasons why they took such a drastic step, the Civil Aviation Administration office here remains tight-lipped, even refusing to confirm or deny whether they are indeed employees of the Civil Aviation Administration.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Late Payment of Land Value Tax: New Penalty Rules Implemented, Based on the Price Index Multiplied by the Tax Amount Due <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Land Administration Bureau began collecting land value tax in this city, the violent fluctuations in prices and the fixed legal tax rate, have resulted in sharp revenue decline, affecting the city treasury. Most citizens are willing to pay the land value tax, but a few large property owners are holding back, delaying payment, because their income is too low to afford it. According to Director Xie and Secretary Qian of the Land Administration Bureau, the land value tax of Hartong Real Estate, which owns so much property, is only three million yuan, so the claim of not being able to afford it is hard to believe. According to Article 200 of the Land Law, a late fee of 2% is added for overdue tax payments, but this amount is too small. A municipal council meeting has passed an additional late fee of 15% and an additional tax of 30%, but the amounts are still small. In view of this, the central government ordered the Land Administration Bureau yesterday to calculate overdue payments by multiplying the tax amount due by the local price index compiled by the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, starting from the date the notice is issued, changing every ten days, which could result in a significant increase in land value tax revenue. The new method will be implemented tomorrow.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xiong Xingyu, the accountant of the Hand-Knitted Cotton Weaving Union in this city, was also in charge of cotton yarn allocation. On September 28 of last year, when the union distributed the 61st installment of cotton yarn, there was an excess of 81 bales, which were temporarily stored with Xi Jianwu, the representative of the 4th district, who issued a receipt for the union's records. In November of the same year, when the 62nd installment of yarn was distributed, the 4th district received 47 bales less than the allotted amount. Xiong instructed Xi to make up for the shortage from the 81 bales stored from the 61st installment. Later, Xiong was involved in another case, and the union investigated old accounts, demanding that Xi return the 81 small bales of stored yarn. Xi truthfully explained the situation. The union reported Xiong's shortage of 47 bales of yarn from the 62nd installment to the District Procuratorate, and yesterday, Judge Ge Jiannong of the District Court sentenced Xiong Xingyu to three months in prison for using fraudulent means to cause another person to deliver property belonging to a third party.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 3 PM on the 8th, a Wang (from Ningbo), a peddler of general merchandise, came to Qixin Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 38 Yiye Lane, Ji'an Road, to buy men's and women's undershirts.

He ordered apprentices Fang Yulin and Zhang Chunhong to accompany Wang to Andong Inn on Hubei Road. Yin Caibao and Sun Binxian, guests in room 204 of the inn, counted the goods downstairs and Wang Kang signed a check from Fuchang Commercial Bank for 1,965,000 yuan, dated the 11th. However, when the check was presented, it was returned. The factory couldn't find Wang Kang. Yin and Sun said that they had sold 150 dozen of No. 505 round-neck shirts to Yongxiang Socks Factory on Fangbang Road in Nanshi the same night, and that they had delivered them with the three of them, there were still ten dozens of women's undershirts, hidden in Yin Caibao's home. He turned Yin and Sun over to the Lao Zha Police Precinct, reporting the circumstances. Section Chief Zhang Kuidong instructed patrol officer Wang Anbang and police officer Sun Zhiming to rush to Yongxiang Socks Factory to retrieve most of the men's and women's undershirts, and also to arrest Wang Kang, who was at large.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Feng, a young woman living at No. 15, Lane 63, Dalin Road, Nanshi, was originally living with a peddler. Later, the woman was arrested and sent to court for selling heroin and sentenced to imprisonment. While in prison, she developed a love affair with Qiu Changlin, a plasterer sentenced for rape. Recently, the two were released on parole and began cohabiting. However, after only a few days, the woman, dissatisfied with Qiu's lack of legitimate income, broke up with him and resumed living with the peddler. Qiu, in a fit of jealousy, suddenly invited the woman out yesterday afternoon. When they passed the French School at Ba Xian Bridge, Qiu took out a bag of lime he had prepared and threw it in the woman's face. The woman's eyes were blinded and she screamed for help. The police and passersby who heard the screams arrested Qiu and sent him to the police station. The woman was taken to Si Ming Hospital for emergency treatment, but because the lime was highly corrosive, she was already blind in both eyes when she arrived at the hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Preliminary Discussion on Stabilizing Prices Through Cooperative Organizations (Continued from Page Two) <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(6) Using US Aid to Strengthen Price Stabilization Efforts: We propose that textiles and grains from US aid should be allocated to consumer cooperatives for distribution at fair prices, with preferential treatment for the poor and public employees. Fertilizers should be allocated to agricultural cooperatives, with preferential treatment for poor farmers and owner-cultivators. These allocated goods should be repaid with harvested produce. The recovered agricultural products should be distributed to consumer cooperatives or industrial cooperatives, according to their nature.</p>
<p>(7) Eliminating Idle Capital and Implementing a Transfer Accounting System: If the government can implement a transfer accounting system to eliminate sources of idle capital, every expenditure or loan can be tracked, reducing the need for currency circulation. For example, every manufacturer or cooperative should open an account with a bank, and all receipts and payments should be made through the bank using checks. Individuals should use cooperatives as a hub, and banks should establish a clearinghouse, which would make it difficult for idle capital to arise.</p>
<p>Improving Financial Facilities and Expanding Fair-Price Production and Sales Loans: The most advanced monetary theory today is managed standard. Under a managed standard, the circulating currency is like today's gold yuan. Therefore, the currency itself is not the problem; the problem is the technique of currency management. If we are afraid of inflation and dare not lend, but on the other hand, we dare not not lend in order to increase production, the result will be a contradictory financial phenomenon. This contradiction will inevitably prevent production from increasing and inflation from being avoided. We believe that there are several types of loans that can help stabilize prices and should not be considered inflationary. First, consumer cooperative loans can purchase fair-priced goods and implement fair-price distribution. Second, allocated goods production loans can recover physical goods and implement fair-price distribution. Third, agricultural product transportation and sales cooperative loans can enable farmers to jointly transport agricultural products to the market. Sold at government-controlled prices, avoiding middleman exploitation. Fourth, various cooperative loans in pacified areas can stabilize people's livelihoods, win hearts and minds, and can be used to seize materials and block materials. Fifth, export material production and sales cooperative loans can enable export goods to bypass the hands of merchants and be concentrated in government-dedicated institutions. These loans should be fully planned and controlled, and should be re-mortgaged by the Central Bank to achieve effective results.</p>
<p>(9) Strengthening Cooperative Management and Promoting Sound Development: Judging from the above, some may think that this plan can only be implemented when cooperatives are truly sound. This is not the case. After all, cooperative enterprises are one sector of various enterprises run by the people. People's morality and ability cannot be without merits and demerits, that is, the results of various enterprises cannot be without differences. Since various enterprises cannot be without differences, cooperative enterprises cannot be without merits and demerits. When we look at cooperative organizations, we only ask whether they are more in line with ideal requirements in nature and system, and whether they are likely to be sound. We should not make harsh demands on cooperation beyond society and beyond the times. We should use various forces to seek sound development in common application and common assistance, which can be called justice. Moreover, the cooperative system is bound to encounter strong resistance because it conflicts with vested interests, which is inevitable for any socialization movement. If we lightly accept because someone resists and cannot remain steadfast, the economic system will never be reformed!</p>
<p>(10) Strictly Implementing Reward and Punishment Measures to Establish Discipline: Stabilizing prices should focus on production, sales, and consumer cooperatives, as well as factories that produce allocated goods. All private enterprises that do not belong to these tasks should be subject to various restrictions. Those who deliberately undermine the fair-price policy should be punished accordingly, while the cooperatives and factories should be given various incentives. Cooperatives and factories can carry out production increase and fair-price competitions, and those with outstanding achievements should be given highly honored awards. If there is poor performance or embezzlement in these cooperatives and fair-price factories, they should be subject to the same punishments as speculative merchants. (March 8, March 12)</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the 38th Arbor Day, and the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Social Affairs held a commemorative meeting at Zhongshan Park yesterday morning at 9:30 AM. The presidium was composed of military and police leaders of this city, with Mayor Wu Guozhen, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Director of Public Works Zhao Zukang, Director of Social Affairs Cao Peizi, Director of Education Li Ximou, Police Chief Mao Sen, Chairman of the General Labor Union Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Rice Industry Association Wan Molin, Senators Zhang Zhongyuan, Yu Shun, and others attending. At the beginning of the meeting, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating: "Today is Arbor Day, and it is also the anniversary of the death of the Founding Father. Every year, we think of an ancient saying, 'It takes ten years to grow a tree, and a hundred years to cultivate a person.' Whether it is planting trees or cultivating people, we must strive to nurture and support them, and regardless of how harsh the environment, there will be excellent results."</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Cutting Down Trees is Hoped For</p>
<p>Speaker Pan gave a speech, stating: "Cause and effect are mutually cyclical. Today, we diligently plant trees one by one, and in ten or a hundred years, there will be forests of trees. As the saying goes, 'You reap what you sow.' Whether it is being a person, studying, or doing things, this principle applies." Then, Police Chief Mao Sen gave a speech, stating: "Today, seeing a green expanse in the park symbolizes that winter has passed and spring has arrived, giving people a feeling of excitement. The current situation is like a dull winter, and I believe it will pass soon, and a thriving spring will arrive." Chairman Wan Molin expressed that trees must be protected after planting. Recently, there have been cases of soldiers illegally cutting down trees, and he hoped that the authorities would strictly prohibit this. Senator Zhang Zhongyuan stated that both cultivating people and planting trees are important, and that Arbor Day should consider the countless out-of-school children in this city.</p>
<p>Greening of Qingdao is a Model to Learn From</p>
<p>Director of Social Affairs Cao Peizi encouraged everyone with the story of planting trees in Qingdao. He said: "Thirty years ago, Qingdao was a barren island, but now it has become a green garden. The Germans did well to develop this area. At that time, the Germans planted trees to find fresh water sources, and to protect the trees, they issued a strict order that anyone who removed a tree would have one finger cut off. Since then, Qingdao has been covered with green leaves, ensuring water sources. Therefore, protecting trees is very important." Finally, Director of Public Works Zhao Zukang reported that there are more than 20,000 trees in this city, an increase of more than 8,000 since the takeover. Cases of soldiers randomly cutting down trees do occur, and he hoped that the relevant authorities would provide assistance. After the presidium finished speaking, the music team led the way to the earthen mound on the west side of Zhongshan Park, where Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and others personally planted a tree each. The commemorative meeting concluded at 10:30 AM.</p>

<p>Fang Zhi Gave a Speech Encouraging Party Members to Work Hard</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Kuomintang Municipal Party Department held a meeting at the Shanghai Club at 9 AM yesterday to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the death of Premier Sun Yat-sen. More than 500 cadres and comrades from various district party branches attended, as well as Central Committee members Zhang Zhiben and Pan Gongzhan, and Shen Zonglian, representative of Mayor Wu. Chairman Fang Zhi reported that the Kuomintang had too much compromise, did not value talent, and did not study the doctrine. In addition to the various defects of vigorously implementing the doctrine, he pointed out how to unite in the future, loyal to the party and patriotic followers of the Prime Minister, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the Prime Minister, address past mistakes, and strive for innovation to save the party and the country from danger. Next, Committee Member Zhang Zhiben elaborated on the true meaning of the Prime Minister's advocacy of peace and struggle to save China, and said that in order to realize true and lasting peace, we must follow the principles of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, and righteousness advocated by the Prime Minister. Committee Member Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, saying: "Today, when we commemorate the death of the Prime Minister, we must recall the history of the Prime Minister's northward journey for peace in 1924. At that time, the Prime Minister was for true peace, while the Beiyang warlords were for false peace. Today, the whole country is eager for peace, but we must be able to distinguish the true from the false. President Chiang's withdrawal and the withdrawal of the National Army north of the Yangtze River show our sincerity in seeking peace, while the Communist Party is mobilizing troops everywhere, gathering troops, and encroaching step by step. Those who do not understand the situation or have ulterior motives are still criticizing the government, which is extremely unfair." The audience shouted slogans in a mood of enthusiasm and indignation and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Women's Day in Guilin <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Yushan and Zhang Meng of This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper in Guilin on the 10th] The "March 8th Festival" celebration, with the attendance of the wife of Acting President Li, was even more lively than in previous years, with more than a thousand people attending, only seven of whom were men. Guo Dejie spoke about the principle of "ordering the family and then governing the country," and put forward two slogans: "Society is ours, and the kitchen is also ours."</p>
<p>Yin Xi (Queen of Guiju Opera Xiao Jinfeng), a member of the presidium, also gave a speech. She said, "Today, women's status in society is very painful, and this pain is inflicted on us by men. I am the most miserable woman, and my life experience is also very rich. I think we women should find ways to turn ourselves over. Marrying a bad husband is a bad thing, and we should get a divorce. If you don't get a divorce, the pain will be even deeper. I have been through it!" This statement by this famous person, who was known by Ma Junwu, aroused great interest from the audience.</p>
<p>The conference, which was not attended by "homemakers," lasted half an hour in the Provincial Government Auditorium before it ended. At noon, the Rongcheng Guiju Opera Troupe hosted the women and performed "Afraid of His Wife," "Three Pleas for Lihua," "Mother Meng Teaches Her Son," and other excerpts.</p>
<p>Women's Day passed like this.</p>
<p>On the 9th, an incident of a man bullying a woman occurred, becoming the first gossip news in Guilin this year. The female protagonist, Zhou Jinghui, is of medium build, wears glasses, and studied Chinese literature at the Great China University. The male protagonist, Qin Shuji, is the head of the First Section of the Municipal Government, not much different in age from the woman, looking about 32 or 33 years old. This pair of "happy enemies" met in the summer six years ago, and soon Zhou became Qin's "Anti-Japanese War wife." Qin had a wife and ignored Zhou, and then had an affair with a woman surnamed Xiong. The second year after the restoration, Zhou Jinghui traveled thousands of miles to find her husband, bringing her nearly four-year-old daughter from Zhejiang. They met with displeasure, and the quarrel was so intense that there was no hope of reconciliation. The mayor's mediation did not have much effect either. Qin, who played with women, was so angry that he did everything he could, in addition to beating him, and instigated his girlfriend to seduce Zhou into remarrying. When remarriage failed, Qin gave Zhou a "red hat," saying: "Some people say you are a spy, and now you are being watched." Zhou could not bear it any longer and had to complain to the newspaper and appeal to society for help.</p>
<p>"Weak, your name is woman." In this society, Zhou Jinghui's experience may be very ordinary.</p>
<p>Here is another piece of women's news: The female workers of the Southwest Textile Factory requested a day off from the factory on "March 8th," but the result was that the entire factory went on strike. The factory asked the guarantors to take the workers back, saying that "the female workers took the excuse of the "March 8th" Festival, stopped work without authorization, and instigated other female workers to take the same action. After the factory director and foreman persuaded them to go to work, they refused to obey. Please ask the guarantor to take them back." Afterwards, the factory fired three female workers, and the rest submitted letters of repentance and resumed work.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Ministry of Finance Instructions Arrived: Gold Trade Association Prepares to Resume Business, Association Notifies Members to Register Immediately <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance's instructions allowing members of the Shanghai Gold Trade Association to resume business were delivered to Xu Fusun, a leader of the industry, by the Ministry of Finance at around 5:00 PM on the 11th. He was instructed to promptly notify fellow members to handle the resumption of business as soon as possible, so that formal operations could be restored within the next week.</p>
<p>The Gold Trade Association held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, chaired by Acting Chairman Zhao Zhongying. More than ten directors and supervisors attended. After discussion, it was generally agreed that before the number of members and the situation were fully understood, it would be inappropriate to rush into resuming business. It was decided to draft a notice to members to register for resumption of business immediately, to be published in various newspapers. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"According to the Ministry of Finance's order to investigate and open up the financial reform case, the trading of gold is now permitted. To facilitate trading and ensure normal prices, the original members of the association should be allowed to resume business. The association is hereby ordered to promptly convene all member businesses to properly plan a sound organization, and to submit a plan for spot gold trading to the Ministry for approval, so that an order can be issued for the resumption of business on a fixed date." The association will comply accordingly. From today onwards, member gold businesses are required to register for resumption of business, so that the report can be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for review and approval as soon as possible.</p>
<p>According to Xu Fusun, the association originally had 168 members. It remains to be seen how many are willing to prepare to resume business after registration. He made it clear that this resumption of business refers to the resumption of business by members of the Gold Trade Association, not the resumption of business of the Gold Exchange, and the latter is currently impossible. The last time the Gold Trade Association members resumed business was a short period from March 1946 to February 8, 1947, almost two years ago.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Finance Minister Xu Kan met with reporters at the National Bank yesterday and stated that the open gold and silver market will be established as soon as next week (i.e., this week). The Central Bank is currently studying concrete plans and has ordered the Shanghai Gold Trade Association to draft gold trading regulations. In the future, trading will be limited to spot transactions. As for the chairman of the association, he will be elected by the association itself, and the Ministry of Finance will not interfere. He then stated firmly that the new financial plan promulgated this time will be implemented to the end, and he believes that the power of speculators will never be able to oppose the government. Finally, when reporters asked whether he would continue to serve as finance minister in He Yingqin's new cabinet, he firmly replied, "I definitely don't want to do it again this time!"</p>
<h3 id="e73">Fluctuating Trend of Chinese Stocks, Market Starts High and Ends Low <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Chinese stock market experienced significant volatility and a fluctuating trend yesterday. In the morning, all stocks opened at a high level, and the market was firm in the middle. However, a sudden reversal occurred near the close, resulting in a rise. Initially, benefiting from the easing of overnight credit conditions, the supply of funds was relatively strong, and the implicit interest rates within the industry declined, improving market sentiment and boosting buying interest. Subsequently, the price of gold plummeted, weakening market sentiment, and the market fell sharply. Yong Yarn opened at a high of 6.01 yuan due to the large traders' deliberate manipulation. The bulls took the opportunity to sell at a high price, briefly falling to 5.78 yuan. However, due to lower interest rates and rising gold prices, yarn, cloth, and securities were actively bought, reaching the limit. Trading was suspended and reopened several times, with a firm trend. Around noon, rumors spread that the Central Bank was selling gold in large quantities, causing a sharp decline in gold prices. Outside investors in silk yarn and cloth unanimously plunged, and floating longs turned short, weakening the market, falling to 5.52-5.48. After the decline, financial stocks were slightly bought, and the market slightly recovered. However, due to the large allocation of gold, credit became scarce near the close, and the overall trend was completed, closing at 5.56, up 10%.</p>
<p>Under the same trend at the morning opening, small and medium-sized stocks were generally healthy. Meiya, Xinyi, Jingfu, Shanglian, and Yonggong once hit their limit. Therefore, except for a slight increase at the end of the low, the rest were mediocre.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Rise</p>
<p>The foreign stock market started high and ended low yesterday. Initially, the foreign exchange market price rose, and the gold trend was still good. Furthermore, due to Saturday, there was constant give and take between bulls and bears. E-Silk first reached 12,300 yuan, then fell to 11,100 yuan, 11,400 yuan. Asia 1120 yuan, British Union 12,500 yuan, 13,500 yuan. Jardine Matheson 33,000 yuan, 36,000 yuan. Each stock rose by about half a percentage point.</p>
<p>Gold Bonds Prosper</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The spot market for gold public bonds looked good at the opening yesterday, and market sentiment was prosperous. Initially, there was a demand for 160,000, and the securities helped to accept it, and the market rose. It stood at a high of 170,000, and finally closed at 175 million. The market is closed due to Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Under Strict Investigation by the Gold Control Bureau, the Situation of Returned Checks Improves <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Under the strict investigation by the Financial Control Bureau, the situation of returned checks on the 11th has been greatly reduced compared to the past. According to the Clearing House, more than 330,000 checks were exchanged on the 11th. Among them, there were 2,341 returned checks, a decrease of about 2,000 compared to the past. The total amount of returned checks was 231.7 million yuan, a decrease of about 1.8 billion compared to the past. However, the settlement was not completed until 9:00 PM. According to the Financial Control Bureau, the increase in returned checks was entirely due to the abuse of overdraft checks by customers in various banks and financial institutions. Therefore, the focus of this investigation will be on checking the accounts of suspected customers, followed by the accounts of the banks and financial institutions themselves.</p>
<p>In addition, the Financial Control Bureau has also been investigating state-owned banks and bureaus since yesterday and is continuing to investigate in detail today. According to reporters, if there are illegal loans or overpayments in the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury, the managers and supervisors will be reported by the bureau and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for strict handling.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Rice Prices Rose Madly Yesterday, White Rice Called as High as 30,000 Yuan, Flour Rose Sharply by 20%, and Cooking Oil Prices Soared <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market experienced another sharp rise. With the easing of credit, market sentiment suddenly became firm, and everyone was bullish. Moreover, the price of gold and other items had risen compared to the previous day, and the cargo owners strongly pulled up the price, causing the market to surge. In the northern rice market, white rice and thin rice both reached 37,000 yuan, with the former rising by 7,000 yuan and the latter rising by 7,500 yuan. Special rice approached the 30,000 mark, opening at 29,000 yuan. In the southern rice market, white rice and early thin rice each rose sharply by 7,000 yuan, and Nanjing glutinous rice opened at 33,000 yuan. Retail white rice had reached the 40,000 mark, all rising by more than 20%. The total arrival of goods in the two markets was 5,158 shi.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil The rising trend became even more intense. With the easing of credit, cargo owners strongly pulled up the price, and retail investors rushed in, causing prices to soar by 20%. Soybean oil once reached a high of 154,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil once reached 147,000 yuan. At the close, floating longs sold, and prices slightly fell. Soybean oil closed at 147,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil closed at 143,000 yuan, each rising by 22,000 to 23,000 yuan, a rise of about 20%. Dasheng and Jingsheng oil reached a high price of 192,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose by 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour The market surged. At the opening, due to the two-day interest rate, the northern gang bought in large quantities with the easing of credit, and the cargo owners took the opportunity to try their best to pull up the price. Moreover, with the leadership of rice prices, market sentiment was unusually firm. Bingchuan reached a high of 15,080 yuan, and Laoche once reached a high of 15,700 yuan. Bran sales were also smooth, rising by about 20%. Large bags are now trading at 12,300 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains The market unleashed a fierce rising trend. With the source of peanuts nearing depletion, cargo owners held on tightly, and the market supply could not meet demand. Yangzhou peanuts rose sharply by 30%, reaching a high of 95,000 yuan, and the delivery price broke the 100,000 mark. Soybeans rose sharply by 20%. Later, due to the weakening of oilseed cakes, they fell back by 1,000 yuan. Green beans retreated to the 30,000 mark. Corn rose by 20%, and white sesame seeds quickly knocked on the 70,000 mark.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The National Bank Continued to Allocate and Sell Gold Yesterday, at 325,000 per tael <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The National Bank continued to allocate and sell gold to the silver shop industry yesterday. At around 10:00 AM, the allocation price was announced at 325,000 yuan per tael. The total application from various silver shops reached more than 1,900 taels, and all were allocated. However, the application time was brought forward to 12:00 PM due to yesterday being a weekend. The price of gold jewelry quoted by various silver shops in the morning was 340,000 yuan. After 12:00 PM, the price of gold gradually decreased, and the price of gold jewelry was also quoted slightly lower at 330,000 yuan. The listed price of gold bars was 331,500 yuan.</p>
<p>The gold note market initially looked good yesterday morning due to the unexpected easing of credit, and buying interest was still strong. However, the floating longs were afraid of a rebound and immediately sold at a high price, and the shorts were very cautious and made up for it at a slightly lower price. Trading in the morning was still strong, opening high and then holding firm. At noon, the Central Bank strongly sold, softening the market, resulting in a low closing. The overnight longs suffered huge losses. The morning opening continued the bullish momentum of the previous day and the still-easing credit. Retail longs bought, and the initial price was 333,000 yuan, 338,000 yuan. After the opening, the market hovered, without showing prosperity or decline. After 11:30, the Central Bank strongly sold, falling to 295,000 yuan, 298,000 yuan. After the fall, retail shorts made up for it, and the morning market ended with a good rebound at 305,000 yuan, 308,000 yuan. In the afternoon, credit turned scarce, but there was no formal trading on Saturday, and with two days of interest, the Monday position was quoted at 348,000 yuan, 353,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar opened at 6,650 yuan, 6,750 yuan in the morning. It hovered slightly in the middle, and near noon, it plunged with the collapse of gold. The market was also small, at 5,900 yuan, 5,950 yuan. The afternoon closing rebounded to 6,100 yuan, 6,150 yuan. There was no quotation heard in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The Five Throws Down Achieve Great Results "Setting Fire to Save Fire" is the Same Person</p>
<p>Last night on Financial Street, the atmosphere was tense, and many banks and financial institutions had liquidity problems and were teetering. The Central Bank took on the responsibility of the bank of banks, opened the door for a night market, accepted these shaky banks and financial institutions, and exchanged them for liquidity at 3 million yuan per gold bar, even though the Central Bank's gold allocation price yesterday morning was 3.25 million yuan.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the market on Saturday afternoons has mostly risen sharply. Yesterday, however, there was an exceptional sharp drop. After 6:00 PM, the implicit interest rate was as high as 2 yuan 5 jiao, which can be said to be unprecedented. More wonderfully, after the market opened yesterday morning, all markets were rejoicing. Of course, the Central Bank's gold allocation price first rose from 290,000 yuan to 325,000 yuan, and the exchange certificate also rose to 5,600 yuan, so how could market sentiment not be excited?</p>
<p>Who knew, everyone had thrown themselves into the net.</p>
<p>Not long after 10:00 AM, news suddenly spread in all markets that the authorities were selling off real goods.</p>
<p>Selling gold, selling U.S. dollars, selling yarn, selling sugar, selling exchange certificates, five throws down, the momentum was huge, and everyone was frightened. The stock market rose sharply and fell quickly, the gold note fell sharply, and from then until late at night, it was all in a gloomy storm.</p>
<p>In the anti-fascist war, "strike the striker"</p>
<p>In the anti-speculation war? Come and "speculate on the speculator"!</p>
<p>Isn't that right? Hang up a high price first, then hit it head-on, although it's close to speculation, there's really no need to be polite to speculators.</p>
<p>In this blow, if speculators are crushed, no one will sympathize with them. The question is: What contribution does it make to stabilizing people's livelihood?</p>
<p>Take yesterday's tight and stormy market as an example, the major commodities closely related to people's livelihood, such as rice, oil, flour, cloth, coal, and imported goods, were not affected by this blow and still rose sharply.</p>
<p>The commodity market is originally not as sensitive as the speculative financial market. It is reasonable that when hitting the speculative financial market, it may not affect the commodity market for a while. Because of this, this offensive should not be a temporary gratification but should be a long-term resistance plan. Then the rumored preparations for the gold and silver market not only do not show any preparation to eradicate speculation but also have a tendency to indulge speculation. Then, can this kind of measure yesterday not make people feel that "setting fire to save fire is the same person"?</p>
<h3 id="e78">Cotton Yarn Initially Firm and Then Pulled Back, Cloth Market Slightly Relaxed Near the Close <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to report a show of strength. The credit situation in the market was slightly looser, market sentiment was floating, and Cantonese transactions were lively. The finishing industry was also particularly interested in fine yarn. All yarns opened high, so boiled red and other goods also reported gains. The street was particularly smooth in its search and absorption, and new peaks emerged one after another. Near noon, news came that the National Bank was selling gold indefinitely, and the circle of people forced the price down unanimously, so the rising trend was not sustained, and it turned sharply downwards, finally closing with a soft position, but still rising more than before.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix was called directly from 2.65 million yuan to 2.8 million yuan. Near the close, there were many floating households selling out, and the price immediately returned to 2.57 million yuan, finally rising by 280,000 yuan. 40-count and 32-count each rose by 200,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan. The spot price of 21-count Double Horse was shouted from 1.3 million yuan to 1.36 million yuan, and finally it was 1.265 million yuan, rising by 120,000 yuan. All grades below 20-count rose by about 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of cotton cloth rose back unanimously, which was a good thing. With the easing of credit, the buying wind restarted, and local customers reached out frequently. In the morning, under the holding of those who held the goods, each cloth station stood at a high level. Then, there were still loose hands, and it was slightly relaxed near the close.</p>
<p>Fine cloth opened at 46,700 yuan and once reached a high of 47,600 yuan. In the afternoon, although the outside market saw a high of 50,000 yuan (delivery on Monday), it was still not enough for two days' interest compared to the afternoon closing. The price of loudspeaker fine cloth rose by 5,400 yuan, and other fine cloths such as Yinyue and Baobei also showed a rising trend.</p>
<p>Sijunzi plain serge opened at 45,500 yuan, reached a high of 45,700 yuan, and finally was 44,900 yuan, rising by 4,400 yuan. In the afternoon, there were slight transactions at 49,000 yuan. Sijunzi white-printed plain serge was priced at 39,800 yuan, and 190 high-end Shilin knocked on the 100,000 yuan mark. Floral serge rose to 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Financial Control Bureau continued to receive more than 50 applications from banks and financial institutions to use the transferred increase in capital cash. The bureau held its 19th review meeting with the Business Bureau and Audit Office of the National Bank on the morning of the day before yesterday, reviewed each case, and approved the use of funds by three new banks and financial institutions, totaling about 200,000 yuan. The rest were applications for renewal.</p>

<p>Cooperate with the Sale Policy</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The person in charge of the National Bank's Business Bureau told reporters yesterday that since the National Bank has successively sold and allocated gold, the prices of financial goods in the city have been relatively stable. It is believed that the situation will be even better starting next week. However, it is not enough to suppress general prices by controlling the prices of financial goods alone. Therefore, the authorities have now drafted another method, which, after being coordinated with the National Bank's sale and allocation of gold and materials, will be able to severely crack down on speculators.</p>

<p>Since the free buying and selling of gold and silver has been permitted, silver dollar vendors have gathered on various roads in the city, which not only affects the appearance of the city but also hinders traffic. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters specially ordered the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday to designate locations and order silver dollar vendors to concentrate their business. The bureau has instructed its subordinate departments to comply and has limited the number of vendors in the Huangpu and Lao Zha districts due to heavy traffic.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money market opened rather calmly, with interbank rates ranging between seventy and eighty yuan. Although there were over twenty billion yuan in settlements for cotton cloth and sugar, remittances from other locations and disbursements from the national treasury flowed out successively, offsetting the former, resulting in a deceptively tight money market that appeared relaxed. Around noon, ten minutes before the gold market closed, news suddenly broke that the National Bank had entrusted a certain gold firm to dump a large quantity of gold, reportedly numbering in the thousands of bars, with one account mentioning four to five hundred large bars. The money market immediately tightened. After 3:00 PM, an unprecedented tightness was observed, with interbank rates soaring to one hundred and fifty yuan. Around 4:00 or 5:00 PM, fellow traders were withdrawing orders in droves, with interbank rates remaining stubbornly around one hundred and forty yuan. Finally, it was heard that financial authorities, in order to regulate the head positions of fellow traders, were using gold priced at 300,000 yuan per tael, US dollars at 6,000 yuan, and foreign exchange certificates at 5,400 yuan, to offset the missing orders. Therefore, after 6:00 PM, the money market began to loosen, and interbank rates retreated to the 100 yuan level. Yesterday, the National Bank's frequent settlements of overnight cotton cloth, sugar, and foreign exchange transfer certificates resulted in an unprecedentedly large deficit of 32,655,000,000+ yuan. Foreign merchants and banks had a surplus of over 190,000,000 yuan, large clearing houses had a deficit of over 10,140,000,000 yuan, and small clearing houses also had an unprecedented surplus of over 40,880,000,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Railway vs. China Aviation: Decisive Battle Today; Whose Will Be the Mayor's Cup? Contributions on Attacking and Defending Strategies for Both Teams <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The fourth Mayor's Cup football match, Railway versus China Aviation, is scheduled for the championship final today at 3:00 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium. The Football Committee has specially invited Mayor Wu to the venue to kick off the match and personally award the Mayor's Cup. A reporter from Shanghai Broadcasting Station will be present to broadcast the battle situation live starting at 3:00 PM. Order at the stadium will be maintained by the Siwei Boy Scouts. Ticket prices for today's match remain the same, at 600 yuan and 400 yuan. The Mayor's Cup football match, which began three weeks ago, will conclude successfully today. Today's referee is Zhang Le, and the linesmen are Ni Xiaoben and Lu Shunzong.</p>
<p>Railway originally harbored ambitions to win the league championship, but their aspirations were thwarted by Qingbai. Now that Qingbai has been eliminated, and their major enemy is gone, this is a golden opportunity. They will inevitably do their best to win this cup. Judging from Railway's recent form, there is hope of touching the championship trophy. Railway's only special feature is the stable and reliable third inner guard, Gao Baozheng. The whole team adopts skillful short passes, with Zhang Jie's charges and Lu Qingxiang's headers. In defense, Gao Baozheng supports it all alone. Ren Xiaowei buys up a good position but lacks hard feet. Jiabang is brave but moves slowly. The midfielders are good at supplying but not good at stealing. The wingers cannot fly. If China Aviation's offense avoids strength and seeks weakness, focusing on cutting in on both wings, combined with a central breakthrough strategy, forcing Baozheng into passivity and luring him away from his home ground, Railway may suffer a serious threat. To restrain the activities of China Aviation's forwards, they should be resisted in the midfield. The young players are brave and fast enough. Once they break free, they are like a runaway horse, charging straight ahead, which will be terrifying. Railway's short passes are indeed lovely, so both wings should increase speed and intelligence to make up for the forwards' slow weaknesses. Hesitation in shooting is a flaw. It is important to seize the opportunity and catch the goalkeeper off guard to have a chance to break through Fu Sheng's iron gate. Therefore, Railway's victory or defeat depends on the form of its forwards. Because there is Baozheng in the defense, there is still hope. "Attack is the best defense." Strengthening the attack can reduce the threat to the defense. If they can score the first goal and establish their authority, they can be confident of victory.</p>
<p>If China Aviation borrows players from Hong Kong, they can defeat Railway. If they field the original team, they can also threaten them. The young players have been training hard for the past two weeks, with soaring ambitions. Some people say, "The young players beating Qingbai is just doing the work for someone else, it's all in vain." But the young players say it well, they are not working for others, but hoping to wear this yellow robe themselves. This is the young players' ambition, and there should be a fierce battle with Railway.</p>
<p>China Aviation's lineup should be very cautious. Both wings must fly together, so Xu Zuguog must be used as a winger. Since both wings must fly together, Gao Xiuqing should take the responsibility of completing the final breakthrough with a central breakthrough, while Yin Qingbing and Chen Yuwei serve as inner forwards. Xiuqing is good at shooting and is in very good shape. The center forward's position is prominent, and there are more opportunities to shoot. The midfielders are average, relying on their fighting spirit. If they steal the ball, they must send it out to the forwards with a long kick. Railway uses short passes, and the midfielders must also advance away from defense to assist the attack, so that their midfielders cannot return to defense, and China Aviation can grasp the initiative of the attack. Therefore, there must be long kicks to send the forwards to a firm place. If relying solely on dribbling to deliver the ball, then it will be slow, and Railway's midfielders will have returned to defense, and can calmly deploy to meet the attack.</p>
<p>Xie Xichuan is the only one who is good at headers. Xiao Ziping must keep a close eye on Xiao Ziwen. Shang Huajun will not easily suppress Lu Qingxiang's headers. Chuan Han also will not easily block Zhang Jie's movements. If you want to reduce the threat of headers, you must prevent crosses from both wings. To restrain Zhang Jie's movements, you must firmly nail Xiao and Lu's inner forward activities. The first priority is to resist Railway's offensive, then you can break through its defense. China Aviation must also show a fighting spirit to deal with this great battle. Luck is also a factor in winning. China Aviation has narrowly survived twice, is it blessed? (Qi Gong)</p>

<h3 id="e87">China United Defeats Sea Green; Leads All the Way; Intense Enthusiasm in the Indoor Basketball Court <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the basketball league, China United "Smooth Sailing" defeated Sea Green 55-42 last night. The score was 38-18 in the first half. The audience roared with excitement. In the first half, China United's crazy offensive, with five players scoring evenly, was clean and clear. Each performance was satisfying, and China United had a clear advantage. In the second half, there were widespread substitutions, and Sea Green began to have a chance to compete. In the women's group, Xinghua defeated Li Team 38-14, with the score being 18-9 in the first half. In Grade 2B, Post and Telecommunications defeated Hezhong 55-30, with the score being 24-19 in the first half.</p>
<p>Last night, China United used Fu Jinsheng, Wu Chengzhang, Liu Fushan, Li Zhenzhong, and Bao Songyuan to deal with Sea Green. After the game started, Jin Sheng missed a free throw, and Kirkel immediately reported a goal. Zhenzhong received the ball under the basket on this side and sent it into the basket on the other side. Chuan Bao added two more goals, and the momentum was magnificent at 6-2. Bao and Paikes Keikel each added one goal. At this time, Sea Green already had three blacks and two whites, and the lineup changed.</p>
<p>Zhenzhong's long shot, Gibson's secret arrow, and Wu Chuanliu's endless attacks. After ten minutes, the other side became two blacks and three whites. Chengzhang's stealing "leftovers" and Liu Chuanbao's crazy attacks were cheered by the audience.</p>
<p>Little black carbon Pannock scored a goal and shook his head. Bulunhuo scored and was called out. Paikes, the darkest among them, also aimed at the basket and threw it. The team scored three goals in a row, and soon the score became 33-18, and China United's prestige was slightly frustrated. However, Songyuan's long strides increased Sea Green's burden. In the first half, China United was 38, and Sea Green was 18, and the number of wins and losses was already determined.</p>
<p>After the break, there were slight adjustments. China United replaced Zhenzhong and Jinsheng with Le Jiazhou and Zhang Liangxiong. China United committed its first foul in the second half, which shows that their psychology was not nervous. Sea Green's spirit of not giving up for Bulunhuo Gibson, and the three black carbon balls following the enemy, were inseparable. 46-25, Sea Green gradually improved, and soon Hanting replaced Fushan. 50-25, China United committed its second foul. Sea Green's never giving up, China United finally won 55-42, not much difference.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Olympic Female Champion (3): Biography of Mrs. Koen, the Flying General of Holland <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ding Xin</p>
<p>Mrs. Koen is teaching her son "Little Jan" and her daughter "Little Fanny" to brush their teeth.</p>
<p>Fanny is indeed working hard on her practice. Except for a few months of suspension during her two pregnancies, she has never interrupted her training over the years. During the war, there were no international masters for her to compete with. The female athletes from Holland were unwilling to race with her as she ran like a wild, unbridled horse. In anger, Fanny decided to compete with the men. At a sports meet in 1943, Fanny actually signed up to join the men's group and finished the 100 meters in 11.5 seconds, ranking fourth, actually beating two other muscular men.</p>
<p>It was not until 1946 that Fanny had a chance to show her strengths. At the European Championships in Oslo, Norway, despite being less than seven months postpartum and having a sprained ankle in the 100-meter final, Fanny not only overwhelmed the women in the 80-meter hurdles, but also won first place for the Dutch relay team.</p>
<p>At the 14th World Games last year, Fanny experienced the most dangerous and tense scene. This time, even Jan, who has always been calm, and still serves as the head coach of the Dutch delegation, was a little beside himself. It was the 80-meter hurdles final at 3:00 PM on August 4th. Fanny, who had won the 100-meter title two days earlier with 11.9 seconds, was now going to compete against Miss Katerina, "Britain's hope." The beautiful Miss Katerina is only 19 years old and is a dance teacher at Oxford University. British newspapers were saying, "Fanny Koen has no hope of winning, she is too old."</p>
<p>Just as the other five athletes were concentrating on the track, waiting for the starting signal, Fanny suddenly froze and did not even hear the gunshot. By the time the other five had run close to the first hurdle, she instinctively woke up and started running frantically forward. But her steps, faster than a wild hare, were still able to catch up with the other racers, and she reached the finish line at the same time as Katerina.</p>
<p>It was impossible to distinguish with the naked eye who was ahead, Fanny or Katerina. Before the film taken by the electric camera at the white line was developed, suddenly, the band played the British national anthem, and the stands erupted in cheers. Impatient reporters and racers in the arena rushed to congratulate Katerina. Even Katerina herself was gloating over being able to win the first gold medal for her country. Over there, Fanny, crestfallen, was looking for Jan, preparing to apologize to him. Suddenly, the official results were announced: Although Fanny and Katerina broke the world record with 11.2 seconds, the film showed that Fanny was the first to reach the finish line. Katerina had to settle for second place by a nose. Only then did Fanny realize that the band's performance and the audience's shouts were originally welcoming the British Emperor and Empress, who had come uninvited to the conference.</p>
<p>Driven by a sense of responsibility, Fanny still apologized to Jan. Because she had a record of 11 seconds flat in practice in Amsterdam earlier in the year, if she hadn't started too slowly, she might have run under 11 seconds, so there would have been no need for Jan and herself to worry.</p>
<p>Two days later, Fanny won the 200-meter title with a record of 24 seconds, eclipsing Mildred "Babe" Didrikson Zaharias, who won the javelin and hurdles events in the 1932 Los Angeles Games and another second place. Winning three gold nuggets alone also wrote a new page in Olympic history.</p>
<p>Before the end of the conference, Fanny, like a locomotive, pulled the already lagging Dutch relay team, surpassing the other five women's teams. She and the oddball Jesse Owens, who created a record of winning four honorary awards in the 1936 Berlin Games, shined successively.</p>
<p>Invitations for Fanny to perform flew in like snowflakes from major cities around the world. The Blankers family was also happy to accept. Last September, Fanny tied her own 80-meter hurdles record in Finland with 11.2 seconds. This spring, Fanny, Jan, and their two children boarded a plane again for their first long journey outside of Europe, flying to Australia.</p>
<p>Fanny rarely has more than two minutes of free time at home. Almost all of her time is spent running back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room. In addition, she serves Jan and her two children. She gets up at 7:30 in the morning. After preparing breakfast, she has to wash and dress the children. Just coaxing them to brush their teeth, this Dutch mother has to mess around for a while. After sending the older children to school, tidying up the beds and sweeping the house, she takes her two-year-old daughter to the vegetable market to buy what she is allowed to buy with ration coupons - one pair of eggs every two weeks per person, one pound of cheese a month, and meat that is only available on weekends. Fortunately, green vegetables and onions are no longer rationed. (During the German occupation, you had to queue up for bread at 5:00 AM every morning!)</p>
<p>The afternoon is for washing and mending, and most of the time is spent knitting wool clothes. Most of the clothes for the two children and herself are handmade by her.</p>
<p>Dinner is around 7:00 PM, and after dinner, if friends come, they play bridge and chat. Otherwise, they use reading for recreation. They live such an ordinary life.</p>
<p>Jan's annual salary at the police station is 5,000 guilders (approximately $1,850). He also earns more than 2,000 guilders a year for writing for several newspapers. He is also a good reporter! During the London Games, he sent telegraphs and wrote dispatches for a major Dutch newspaper. When Fanny defeated Katerina, he reported: "The world's best hurdler won a victory by a hair's breadth. The tension and danger of the situation have not yet allowed the reporter's pulse to return to normal."</p>
<p>As punctual as a clock, Fanny practices twice a week for two hours each time at the Olympic Stadium to maintain her level. "Her posture," Jan said, "is impeccable, except that her fingers are slightly stiff (see the close-up of her fingers at the end of the 100 meters published on the 11th). But in fact, Fanny's stiff fingers and her pre-competition timidity are not a problem.

<h3 id="e91">On Indexing Books <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Yu</p>
<p>When reading Western books, especially those in the social sciences, one thing that impresses me the most is the accuracy and completeness of their indexing work. After reading, one can always use the index at the back to quickly find information and use it forever. It is said that even for voluminous works such as the complete works of Shakespeare, someone has created extremely detailed indexes, with accurate statistics and annotations on how often a certain word is used, how often it is not used, and how many times a certain word is used. This kind of dedication is truly amazing. Culture is the accumulation of thousands of years of human effort, and it is because of the contributions of these people that the foundation of culture is strong and unshakable.</p>
<p>Of course, in-depth research on certain knowledge or certain works has also existed in our country since ancient times, and it is no worse than in foreign countries. The so-called "studying the classics until one's hair turns white" is an expression of this spirit. However, the result is often either drilling into the horns of a dilemma or just forming a reflection of one's own thoughts. It often fails to achieve the task of paving the way and building bridges for later researchers. There are many reasons for this, but the lack of importance, unscientific nature, and unsystematic nature of indexing work is one of the main problems.</p>
<p>In the past, our country had a long period of selecting scholars through imperial examinations, and the Four Books and Five Classics unknowingly turned the hair of many scholars white. But even for these classics that were required reading for scholars at the time, although there were many interpretations, there has never been any systematic indexing work that focuses on the matter at hand. In recent decades, many Chinese works on natural sciences and social sciences have also been published. Due to practical needs, some people have been willing to seriously do indexing work, but it is still far from the standard of usability. When we read a book, we always feel powerless to fully utilize all the material in it, which is a defect that urgently needs to be remedied.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the language, it is easier to index and check foreign books, which is a fact. But this difficulty is not impossible to overcome. The problem is just how to find appropriate words to represent a certain idea or thought, and this method of representation must be commonly understood and accepted by the general public. It is difficult to enforce this rigidly. I think it is better to let it happen naturally. If every book and every author makes efforts in this direction, although there will inevitably be great differences at first, it will slowly merge into a path that everyone can use.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Reading Machine for the Blind <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Jiahao</p>
<p>The most distressed people in the world are deaf-mutes and the blind.</p>
<p>In various civilized countries in Europe and America, large sums of money have been specially allocated for these two kinds of pitiful people to run schools for the deaf-mute and the blind, and to implement special education, so that not only can deaf-mutes see and write like ordinary people, but even the blind can touch and read words and write letters using special books in Braille.</p>
<p>However, the books used by the blind must be specially made. Ordinary flat books cannot be used, which is a major shortcoming. Therefore, an American scientist named Nuom Baike recently invented a reading machine for the blind to remedy this shortcoming and benefit the blind all over the world.</p>
<p>With this machine, any bird book can be transformed into Braille and enlarged in a short period of time, so that the blind can touch and read it at will.</p>
<p>This machine is composed of two parts: broadcasting and printing. The broadcasting machine is specially used to irradiate the text on the book and transmit its image to the printing machine. The printing car in the printing machine travels horizontally from side to side on a thin lead plate, piercing dotted lines to form embossed text.</p>
<p>To preserve the text on the lead plate, the lead plate can be stored. Otherwise, the lead plate can be passed through two rotating cylinders, and the embossed text will be pressed off, and the lead plate can be used again next time.</p>
<p>The blind can use this machine freely after only one month of practice, and can touch and read any book.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Orchid <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Song Renying</p>
<p>The author shamefully admits that he cannot secure the country with his writing or pacify the nation with his martial arts. In this chaotic world, he has to learn from the ancients and "write a painting of secluded orchids when the mood strikes, so as not to use money that creates sin in the world" to barely make a living. Now that spring orchids are in full bloom, the fresh and fragrant scent of several pots of orchids in the small garden, introduced by Mr. Feng, rushes into my nose in waves and penetrates my heart and lungs, making my worried brows relax and my troubles disappear. Walking closer to admire them, I feel like I am facing an old friend, like I am meeting a gentleman, and my feelings of joy and comfort are indescribable.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Orchids are likened to gentlemen, and orchids are likened to scholars. Although the characters are different, the flavors are not different," which is certainly not a false statement.</p>
<p>Planting orchids is very difficult. The first task is to be timely, to measure the land and live in it, to follow its yin and yang, to fulfill its nature, to water and remove insects lightly, and to pay special attention.</p>
<p>Painting orchids is also very difficult. The beauty of writing orchids lies in the breath and charm first. The ink must be of fine quality, and the water must be clear spring water. The inkstone must be free of old dirt, and the brush must be pure and not hard. The hand must be like lightning, and there must be no delay. Flying on the paper, the dragon comes to life.</p>
<p>Zheng Suonan painted orchids without painting soil, because he was grieving over the loss of his country's territory. He was truly a patriotic man. He painted a scroll of orchids, more than a foot long and five or six inches high, with the inscription "Purely gentlemen, no villains at all," with profound intentions.</p>
<p>My humble work, "A Hundred Orchids", has already been inscribed with poems by dozens of famous people. Now, in order to reach a hundred, it will be printed into a book, and I am specifically soliciting inscriptions from major poetry circles at home and abroad. If you are willing to form an ink relationship and bestow your masterpieces, I would be very grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Extravagance, Cruelty, Corruption <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qun</p>
<p>In Xue Fucheng’s "Yong'an Notes," there is a passage recording the extravagant and decadent lives of the river management officials in Qingjiangpu (now Qinghe County, Jiangsu) during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. Reading it truly makes one’s heart tremble.</p>
<p>Just talking about eating, one banquet was so lavish with bizarre and exotic delicacies that it lasted three days and three nights without ending, so no guest could eat until the end. They would always leave the table when the wine was low and the people were weary.</p>
<p>What kind of things did they eat? They were bizarre and utterly inhumane. It’s a wonder they could think of so many wonderful methods. For example, a bowl of so-called "team jerky" was made from the meat on the backs of dozens of fat pigs (discarding meat from other parts of the body). And these dozens of unlucky pigs were not dispatched quickly with a "white knife in, red knife out" ending their lives, but were beaten to death alive with bamboo sticks. Because it was said that pigs killed in this way had all their essence concentrated in their backs, making the back meat incomparably sweet and crisp.</p>
<p>For example, the so-called "goose palms" required dozens or hundreds of geese per banquet. The method was to drive flocks of geese onto red-hot iron sheets, forcing them to have nowhere to run and scalding them to death alive. Only the two palms of each goose were taken, and the rest was discarded. The reason was the same: geese killed by this "branding iron" method had their essence concentrated in their feet, and other parts were unfit for consumption.</p>
<p>For example, the so-called "camel hump" involved tethering healthy camels to pillars, pouring boiling water on their backs until they died. The essence was concentrated in the hump, so only the hump was cut off, and the entire camel was discarded. Three or four such camels were needed to make one banquet of camel hump.</p>
<p>For "monkey brains," a round hole was cut in the center of the dining table, and a monkey was placed under the table, its head protruding through the hole and secured with wood so it could not escape. The poor monkey's head was first shaved, then the scalp was peeled open, immediately followed by pouring hot soup over it, and simultaneously breaking the skull with an iron pestle. Thus, amidst cries of sorrow, guests could use silver spoons to scoop out and eat the brain matter.</p>
<p>Another example is "fish soup," made with large, live carp suspended upside down from the rafters, their heads smashed, and fresh blood dripping into a pot of boiling water below. The fish writhed in agony in the steam, twitching its head and tail until it died. Then, another fish was exchanged in. Dozens of fish were used to make one bowl of bloody fish soup.</p>
<p>See how extravagant and cruel this is! Precisely because it was so extravagant, they naturally had to rely on corruption to amass wealth in order to squander it. Precisely because it was so cruel, they fattened themselves at the expense of the people, and naturally, they were unscrupulous.</p>
<h3 id="e95">After Watching "Love of the Sea" <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Long</p>
<p>At a time when Shanghai's stage plays are so desolate, it is indeed exciting to see a grand opera performed at the Lyceum Theatre.</p>
<p>I recall that purely Chinese operas have rarely been performed in Shanghai before. During the War of Resistance, there was a performance of "Qiu Zi" in Chongqing, but it was not very successful. The Yue Yi Society also previously performed a small opera, "Song of Shanghai," but it resulted in losses due to excessive expenses. Originally, the performance of a well-formed opera requires mobilizing significant manpower and resources, which is indeed a difficult matter in the current social economy of China.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the performance of "Love of the Sea" can also be described as a miracle. They had no reliable financial support at all. They overcame these economic difficulties solely through the cooperative efforts and hard work of many young artists dedicated to art.</p>
<p>Their symphony orchestra was performed by the Tsinghua Symphony Orchestra, which had just arrived from the Northeast, and purely on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>The story of "Love of the Sea" is adapted from Loti's "An Iceland Fisherman", so even many of the names retain their Western flavor. The entire performance is also entirely modeled after the Italian opera style. Due to material constraints, the entire play uses only one set; changes in each act rely solely on lighting and sound effects to achieve the desired impact. The lighting design is very successful and can be said to have exhausted all possibilities in striving for the best effect. The transformation of the moonlit night and sunrise both exhibit superb techniques.</p>
<p>Sound is a very important part of opera performances. Here, the biggest shortcoming of the entire accompaniment is the lack of climactic performance. The entire accompaniment maintains a consistent level of stability. Because it is too stable, there is no contrast between high and low, so it is not easy to make people feel suffocated during tense moments in the plot.</p>
<p>The orchestra's accompaniment is generally not bad. However, the solo piano parts seem to be used too much. Of course, it is much simpler in terms of processing, but in terms of effect, apart from being used alone when accompanying monologues, other parts should be accompanied by symphonic harmonies, which are easier to produce results.</p>
<p>Miss Ye Ruzhen, the female lead, has a very good singing voice, with sufficient tone and volume to utilize. Zang Yuyan, the male lead, also has a decent voice. The solo parts of the second male lead, Li Mengxiong, seem to be a little worse, perhaps due to the unsuitable lyrics. Yang Huatang, who plays the father, seems to be a little too high in pitch, which doesn't coordinate well with the lower parts and often makes the listener feel tired.</p>
<p>Speaking not too strictly, this is a very worthwhile opera to see, especially if we can forgive the limitations of their economic situation.</p>

<p>— Joke</p>
<p>A boss returned from a banquet, having heard a few jokes. Feeling very pleased with himself, he gathered all his subordinates in the office to tell them. All the subordinates laughed heartily after hearing them, except for one female typist who didn't laugh at all.</p>
<p>"What?" the boss asked. "Do you have no sense of humor at all?"</p>
<p>"I don't need to laugh," the female typist replied. "I've already resigned and I'm leaving tomorrow."</p>

<p>A small civil servant, worried about the soaring prices of goods these days, confided to his colleague:</p>
