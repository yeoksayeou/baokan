<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍息：蘇州方面現有我勁旅防守，甚為安謐，蘇滬車暢通無阻。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕軍息：無錫我軍於廿三日晚十時主動撤移後，卽為共軍千餘佔領，一部續沿京滬鐵路向東南竄犯，其先頭部隊百餘竄至新安鎭附近騷擾，刻我軍為防堵匪軍沿路南下，已將滸墅關以北鐵軌予以破壞。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>靑年的苦惱與警惕</h3>
<p>我們今日正面臨着一個互古未有的大時代，國際情勢瞬息萬變，新舊思潮衝擊劇烈。第二次大戰以後，我們原期望國際間能奠定一個長治久安的和平基礎，然而全世界人民的心理上仍舊籠罩着戰爭的陰影。反觀國內，勝利的興奮情緒，沒有保持多久，而人們重又身受戰亂的慘痛經騐。靑年是最敏感的，看到舉世一片混亂，烽火遍地，到處窮愁，心中怎能不感覺極度的苦悶！鬰結於中，發為對現實的不滿，再表現於外，因此思想龐雜，行動激越，造成社會不安的嚴重現象。</p>
<p>目前靑年最大的苦悶，乃在缺乏一個正確的生活目標，一個一貫的生活理想。羅素說：「人生的痛苦，不在衣食的匱乏，而在思想的漂泊無依」。此時靑年的苦悶，實由於他們思想彷徨而無所歸趨。處于這樣一個大時代，而缺乏對於這個大時代本質的正確認識，不能選擇自己應走的道路，那自然會感到苦悶的。</p>
<p>靑年們對現實不滿，當然有客觀的社會因素的。我認為能對現實表示不滿的，還是好靑年。至少他有理性，情感和熱忱·一個醉生夢死茍且偸生的靑年，他只知物質生活的享受，根本就想不到國家社會的問題，能計慮到個人或民族的前途倒是有心人了。有心人才有希冀和理想，才會發生「滿」與「不滿」之感。實在，民族國家的希望倒是寄託在這些感覺苦悶的靑年身上。</p>
<p>生當二十世紀五十年代的靑年，心頭的苦悶要比已往任何時間為多；但是他們的幸運也是過去的靑年所夢想不到的。經騐就是教育，生活是一面鏡子。正因這個大時代的變幻多端，奇觀偉蹟，盡呈眼前，我們可以獲得許多經騐。現在生活又是最有力的教訓，人類爭取生存的一幅幅偉大塲面，也只有今日才會展開。如果說人類靠學習才能進步，那麼今日正是學習的絕好機會，我們可以斷定未來人類文化的進展一定很驚人。我們今日面臨的這一段艱難困苦的歷史，亦卽是走入一個新的理想的社會所必經的過程。為人類的前途，靑年不該逃避自身應盡的責任，時代愈艱苦，愈要加緊努力，愈要增強接受困難的勇氣。</p>
<p>一味對現實表示不滿，是無濟於事的。我們應以客觀的態度和高度的理智去分析造成令人不滿的種種因素。靑年富正義感和熱情，但有時感情不免掩沒理智，分辨事物也常憑直覺，希望心過切，徒然是感覺上一時的衝動。卽如心想發行社會，動機原是很好的，但是發行社會總不能一蹴而幾。社會各種病態的形成，有着遠的·近的·內在的·外來的種種原因。欲言改造，首在明瞭癥結之所在，按縝密的計劃，確切的步驟，適當的方法，逐步着手，決不能盲動，決不能操之過急，期之過切。我們的理想不怕高，但工作却須脚踏實地。世間的事沒有倖獲的。靑年眼看今日國家社會的杌隍不安，發為深長的感歡和憤慨，恨不能立刻把頹局挽回，但有誰想到中國的問題根本就受世界局勢的影響，為了解決當前的問題，我們的目光要放得遠些。我們今日最大的要求，固在力謀國家的和平與統一，集全力以完成建國的任務，但是目前的世界是利害相連休戚相關的，我們希望自己的國家能久安下去，就得進一步促進世界的和年。</p>
<p>美國政治家威爾遜說：「靑年們處動亂的時代，更應持以鎭定的態度應付那變動。」我們覺得愈是紊亂的時代愈應沉着鎭靜，以客觀的態度處理問題。靑年血氣方剛，遇事激越躁急，這是由於沒有明瞭在安定中求進步的道理。卽以在學的大中學生而論，在人力物力如此艱難的時候，還能有讀書的機會，自身卽應知所檢束，力圖奮勉。知識靑年為國家命脈之所寄，應為民衆樹立良好的楷模，使自己能形成一種轉移習尚安定人心的力量。</p>
<p>我們中華民族到今日已漸漸衰微了，靑年立志報國，應從自身發奮圖強，力爭上流。除了刻苦力學，充實知能，鍜鍊體魄，砥礪人格，沒有其他可以報國之道。二次大戰中，歐美有不少科學家埋首實騐室，進行科學硏究，他們的求知精神値得效法。靑年更應培養道德的勇氣，才能負擔建國的艱巨任務。先哲有言：「時窮節乃見，一一垂丹靑！」我們沒有殉國成仁的果敢精神，怎樣從事開基的偉業？怎樣貫澈「為萬世開太平」的理想？靑年為國家社會安危之所繫，應勉為大時代巨浪中一員肯負責任的柁手。曾子說：「士不可以不弘毅，任重而道遠。」身為知識份子的靑年學生，應該深自警惕，努力學習，切實硏究，勤勉於分內的工作，為學術為文化荷負知識的責任。</p>
<p>易卜生有句名言：「你要把這塊材料陶鑄成器。」靑年學生除去在校內接受教育以外，還得注意自我修養，要把自己鍜鍊成一個有用的人。眞金在火裏鍊出來的。靑年如果要希望自己能有所成，有所為，那就得經過一番千錘百鍊的功夫。語云：「精誠所至，金石為開，」處于目前的大時代，靑年正好把握砥礪鍊的機會，願各自珍重！</p>

<h3>英美法照會波恩議會　西德憲法放寬限制　關於聯邦財政暨立法權　德兩大政黨獲一般協議</h3>
<p>〔路透社波恩城廿四日電〕西德制憲議會之各黨領袖，關於起草憲法事已就各重要點獲致協議，僅餘一點尚待磋商，卽關於國立學校中教授宗教科目之點。社會民主黨與基督民主黨就此點意見尚有距離，在各黨領袖獲致一般協議前之四十八小時，盟國曾向德國領袖提出措辭緩和的照會，放寬起草西德憲法的限制。關於聯邦政府與邦政府財政及立法權分配之點，已由各黨領袖擬具協議的公式，其細則已呈交三強軍事總督，以便於明日由三督與各德國領袖開會檢討。在財政方面已接受三強之建議，同意由每邦設立稅務局，惟聯邦政府亦得徴收若干種捐稅，以維持其本身之開支。關於立法權的新建議，規定將聯邦議會的權限略事減少，但較社民黨所主張削減者為少。凡有關各邦地方稅之法律，由聯邦在財政上補貼，各邦之法律以及有關各邦疆界及建立聯邦新當局之法律，仍須經聯邦議會之同意。除有關財政及立法之建議外，其他各黨已準備在原則上同意社民黨之要求，縮短憲草內容，惟關於宗教教育之點，基督民主黨尚不願通過由父母決定子女宗教教育之條文。社民黨今日建議此事由各邦自定，蓋教育權通常係採諸各邦政府之手。制憲議會領袖希望此一關於宗教教育之問題得以早日解決，俾於五月初通過最後憲章而於五月中旬交付全體大會最後表決，果爾則可望於收穫以前舉行選舉，俾於夏季成立政府。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿五日電〕美英法三國對德國基本法律表示意見之新備忘錄一件，已送達波恩之德議會委員會，內稱，目前三國外長不能同意將柏林包括在德聯邦共和國之初步組織內。該備忘錄並透露，盟國對於任何規定，凡足以促成省政府及聯邦政府之「財政獨立與適當實力」者，均將加以「同情之考慮」。西德憲法之僵局由於波恩制憲議會中兩大黨意見不一致，其一為有勢力之社會民主黨，另一為比較保守之基督教民主黨。社會黨在議會中所控制之票數，約佔三分之一，曾要求在西德設立一強有力之中央政府。基督教民主黨則主張一漫散之聯邦，着重各省之權利，此一計劃比較符合三國外長一般之意見。</p>
<h3>擁護世界和平大會　巴黎十萬人示威　手持反戰旗幟高唱國際歌</h3>

<h3>房租標準修正草案　房客總聯會表異議</h3>
<p>本市房租標準，業經市府最後修正，待送參議會討論通過後實施。本市房客總聯合會聞悉後卽行緊急集議，經一致公決，認為市府所提草案與參議會上次大會決議重訂房租最高限額案內容頗多出入，堅決表示反對，請求參議會為顧念市民生活疾苦，安定社會秩序起見，鄭重予以修正，其所持反對之理由如下：</p>
<p>（一）參議會原案為重訂房租最高限額，今該辦法第一條規定租額由租賃當事人自行協定，未能成立協議時，始適用該辦法之規定，其用意適與規定限額案相反，蓋規定限額係硬性法案，而該辦法過富彈性，自難發生法律上之效力。（二）依據參議會去年三月間通過之七千倍九千倍法案，追加自去年三月至八月底之生活費漲率，假定於去年九月初以法幣折合金圓券計算，則戰前租金一元，調整為金圓券時，僅為四分及五分二釐（卽等於百分之四及百分之五點二），今該辦法中調整為百分之十五，及二十五三種，自屬過高。（三）房租旣依戰前租金多寡分數級，而營業用房屋在戰前原較住宅為高，今於基數上再行提高百分比，顯屬不合。</p>

<h3>現鈔缺乏今日可望好轉　各業市塲蕭條　多半只做了結</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕時局急轉，昨日各業交易，多抱自掃門前雪姿態，加以票據當日不抵用，又告舊調重彈，行莊有頭寸拆出在外者，均紛紛收回，以應付可能襲來之風潮。致造成昨日業內鬆業外緊之現象，惟日拆每千元已回跌至二三百元間。一般市價，除小菜塲之菜蔬外，大多慘落。</p>
<p>昨日一般商塲，對本票交易，多不歡迎。零售方面，頗多拒收次，致又造成現鈔空前短絀之現象，本票貼現率又高至三成以上。中央銀行以政府各級機關均過滬他遷，加以軍政支撥頻繁，需要現鈔額尤倍蓰於往日，故對一般商業行莊之提現額，僅為隔日存款之一成。惟據國行某負責人語記者，今起為國庫各項臨時支撥較少，則對一般現鈔之供應量可望增加。昨日上午因各行莊候領現鈔未得，故上午現鈔頭寸特緊，傍晚時各方所領現鈔部份出籠，卽告鬆動，各項金融性物品行市亦見回堅。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨日各業市塲交易寥寥。各主要市塲，大多係料理未了業務，新交易一律暫停。所有行市僅屬作價性質。金融市塲，亦同告不利。塲內拆放銳減，各方均抱審慎態度。工商業向行莊以黃金作抵，晨初四億五千萬元，後以投機商紛紛將金鈔拋出抵債，行市再降為三億五千萬元，仍以賣出居多。除一般有多餘頭寸之行莊，乘低收購外，買戶幾無。而工商業及投機商則以頭寸關係，莫不將金鈔低價作抵，放款拆借，大都進行淸理，利息喊價混亂。</p>
<h3>金市交易寥寥　銀元先疲後堅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲，塲內照例以二一六七萬二千漲停板不動。塲外期貨，客戶與字號之交易，均以六三〇〇萬結價了淸。現貨票交，喊價混亂，在三億至四億之間，交易亦寥寥可數。塲外美鈔交易，亦混亂不一。馬路交易，六元五角美鈔交換十元大頭。僅合三〇萬左右，當日票交喊七十萬至八十萬之間，亦　正式市面。</p>
<p>昨日銀元套匯，全部停頓。馬路交易先疲後堅，上午因時局急轉直下，各路單　均紛紛倒流入滬，人心安定，供多求少，呈一片賣出聲。大頭一度跌進三關。小至二七萬，三二萬，瀕午稍升至三〇萬，三五萬。午後因各方應變費，有大量頭寸流出，銀行公司等，傾力　收，傍晚升達四〇萬。小頭喊三〇萬，三五·鷹龍洋喊二二萬，二七萬。本票交易，因一般心理恐慌，價格與現鈔拔開五成之多。大頭上午做四〇萬，五〇萬，下午升至六〇萬，六五萬。較上週末無甚上落。</p>
<p>昨日銀樓飾金，因市況混亂，均告暫停營業，整日未見掛牌。錢兌業亦無掛牌。</p>
<p>紗布交易　無形停頓</p>
<p>昨日紗布市塲因時局驟變，故赴市者無幾。各方疑神疑鬼，均不敢貿然下手，交易無形停頓。至於廠方開貨，大多以袁頭計算，但問津者寥若晨星。門市批發商售價甚為紊亂，計四君子嗶嘰由五元至五元八角，一九〇士林十一元至十五元，營業亦頗蕭條。蓋鄰近鄉鎮接近戰區，無意辦貨，「單幫」受交通影響，亦告絕跡。</p>
<p>華股冷落</p>
<p>證券交易所昨日規定上下午為一計算區域，並定今起徴收當日軋存交易餘額交割準備金五成，業已公告實行。市況因多存觀望，乃見冷落。永紗初做三〇〇元，旋卽在漲限告停，他股亦少呌價。台糖榮豐則告漲停，景福於十一點〇五分降落至限，華豐亦於是時低至四元四角二分，美亞先做六元二角，曾漲至六元八角四分，最後計落至五元，恒豐亦低站跌限收市。結果比上日升降互見。</p>
<p>後市人心益見冷淡，市氣寂寞，多無開價。永紗初做二九〇元，卽升至三〇〇元，嗣後逐步冷落，低至二七五元收市，比午價落廿元，較上週六尚升廿四元。美亞初做五元二角，曾降至四元八角，最後為五元八角。華豐新光各異其趨，新光比午計跌八角，華豐比午計升五角八分。麗安國貨榮豐均在漲限收市，全日成交共計四億一六六〇萬股。內永紗計三〇三〇萬股。</p>
<p>黃金公債，上下午均無成交。</p>
<p>米價傾瀉</p>
<p>昨日糧食市塲，因行莊票據，當日絕對不准抵用，買賣均抱觀望，交易大多停頓，各方均在趕辦了結事宜。惟食米照常交易，因時局劇變，各方紛紛出籠，白粳直瀉至二三〇萬，折合大頭五元五角。其他麵粉，食油，雜糧塲外喊價均一致傾瀉。以大頭折算，兵船喊一元五元，老車喊一元八角，乏人問津。豆油喊二七元，生油喊二六元，生菜油喊二四元，桑園黃豆喊四元，漢口黃蔴喊八元，一致猛落三成至四成。</p>
<h3>梵皇渡路發現無頭女屍　光明理髪舖主　舉家潛逃可疑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬西梵皇渡路金家巷內一臭河浜泥漿內，於昨晨六時許，發現一無頭女屍一具，年可三旬，遍體赤裸，上蓋麻袋一只。經人報告江寗路警分局，派員調查後，獲悉附近一木房棚戶內，設有光明理髪舖一所，前晚該舖主因家庭瑣事，與妻妾發生劇烈爭吵，迨黎明後，卽舉家棄逃，似有可疑，經員警在其房內偵查後，發現血漬斑斑，足印淩亂，大致被害者或係其小妾。現承辦員警正四出跴緝該舖主歸案究辦。</p>
<h3>現鈔荒再起　央行塌便宜</h3>
<p>商店拒用本票支票後，現鈔荒重告嚴重。</p>
<p>商店防行莊突然休息。</p>
<p>金管局昨分令各業，禁止拒用票據。但各業依然拒收。怎麽辦？</p>
<p>唯一辦法，就是　吐現鈔，據傳，昨午後已有大批現鈔頭寸應市。今天可能鬆動鬆動。</p>
<p>上週五起，央行不取主動收銀元，改取被動收銀元。</p>
<p>銀元市價慘落了，央行被動收到大批廉價銀元。這味道很好，所以雖是軍需銀元頗亟，央行仍採被動收銀元的方針。而銀元巨販需要現鈔頭寸，都非主動售與央行不可。</p>
<p>重的笨的東西，市價連天跌落。原因當然是大局關係，近因是為了現鈔緊，又都拒收票據。所以雖是跌，仍鮮成交，幾成有行無市的僵局。</p>
<p>因為現鈔奇缺，烚赤交易，不僅分出現鈔價及票據價二種，而且票據價，大過現鈔價五六倍之多。</p>
<p>真是駭人聽聞的了。</p>
<p>市價一覽</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Youth's Worries and Vigilance</h3>
<p>Today, we are facing a great era unprecedented in history, with international situations changing rapidly and new and old thoughts clashing intensely. After the Second World War, we originally hoped that a long-term peace would be established internationally, but the shadow of war still looms over the minds of people all over the world. Looking back at our own country, the excitement of victory did not last long, and people once again suffered the pain of war. Young people are the most sensitive, and how can they not feel extremely depressed when they see the world in chaos, with the flames of war everywhere and poverty everywhere! This depression festers inside and manifests as dissatisfaction with reality, which is then expressed externally, thus creating serious phenomena of complex thoughts,激烈的actions, and social unrest.</p>
<p>The biggest worry of young people at present is the lack of a correct life goal and a consistent life ideal. Russell said: "The pain of life lies not in the lack of food and clothing, but in the wandering and rootlessness of thought." The current worry of young people is actually due to their wavering thoughts and lack of direction. Being in such a great era without a correct understanding of the essence of this great era and without being able to choose the path they should take, they will naturally feel worried.</p>
<p>Young people's dissatisfaction with reality certainly has objective social factors. I think it is good for young people to be able to express dissatisfaction with reality. At least they have reason, emotion, and enthusiasm. A young person who lives a drunken, dreamy, and complacent life only knows the enjoyment of material life and does not think about the problems of the country and society at all. It is a thoughtful person who can consider the future of individuals or the nation. Only thoughtful people have hope and ideals, and only then will they have feelings of "satisfaction" and "dissatisfaction". In fact, the hope of the nation and the country rests on these young people who feel worried.</p>
<p>The youth who were born in the 1950s have more worries in their hearts than at any time in the past, but their luck is also something that the youth of the past could not have dreamed of. Experience is education, and life is a mirror. Precisely because this great era is full of changes and wonders, we can gain a lot of experience. Present life is also the most powerful lesson. Only today can the great scenes of human struggle for survival unfold. If it is said that mankind progresses through learning, then today is an excellent opportunity to learn, and we can conclude that the progress of human culture in the future will be amazing. The period of hardship and difficulty we are facing today is the necessary process for entering a new and ideal society. For the sake of the future of mankind, young people should not shirk their responsibilities. The more difficult the times, the more they must step up their efforts and strengthen their courage to accept difficulties.</p>
<p>It is useless to simply express dissatisfaction with reality. We should analyze the various factors that cause dissatisfaction with an objective attitude and a high degree of reason. Young people are full of a sense of justice and enthusiasm, but sometimes emotions inevitably obscure reason, and they often judge things by intuition. They hope too much, which is merely a temporary impulse in feeling. For example, the original motive for wanting to reform society is very good, but reforming society cannot be accomplished overnight. The formation of various social ills has various causes, far and near, internal and external. To talk about transformation, one must first understand the crux of the problem, and proceed step by step according to a meticulous plan, definite steps, and appropriate methods. One must not act blindly, one must not be too hasty, and one must not expect too much. Our ideals are not afraid of being high, but our work must be down-to-earth. There is no shortcut to success in the world. Young people see the precariousness of the country and society today, and express deep feelings of sadness and indignation, wishing they could immediately reverse the decline, but who has thought that China's problems are fundamentally affected by the world situation? In order to solve the current problems, we must broaden our horizons. Our greatest demand today is to strive for the peace and unity of the country and to concentrate all our efforts to complete the task of nation-building, but the current world is interdependent and closely related. If we hope that our country can be peaceful for a long time, we must further promote world peace.</p>
<p>The American politician Wilson said: "Young people in turbulent times should be calm and deal with changes." We feel that the more chaotic the times, the more we should be calm and deal with problems with an objective attitude. Young people are full of energy, and they are激烈的and impatient when they encounter things. This is because they do not understand the principle of seeking progress in stability. Even for middle school and college students who are still in school, they should know how to restrain themselves and strive to improve themselves when human and material resources are so scarce and they still have the opportunity to study. Intellectual youth are the hope of the nation, and they should set a good example for the people so that they can form a force that shifts customs and stabilizes people's hearts.</p>
<p>Our Chinese nation has gradually declined to this day. Young people who are determined to serve the country should strive to strengthen themselves and strive for excellence. There is no other way to serve the country other than to study hard, enrich their knowledge and skills,鍛鍊 their bodies, and temper their personality. During the Second World War, many scientists in Europe and the United States devoted themselves to laboratories to conduct scientific research. Their spirit of seeking knowledge is worth emulating. Young people should also cultivate moral courage in order to shoulder the arduous task of nation-building. Sages have said: "One's integrity is revealed in times of distress, leaving a lasting impression on history!" Without the courage to die for one's country, how can we engage in the great cause of founding a nation? How can we implement the ideal of "creating peace for all generations"? Young people are the key to the safety of the country and society, and they should strive to be a responsible helmsman in the great waves of the times. Zeng Zi said: "A scholar cannot be without breadth of mind and firm resolve, for his burden is heavy and his road is long." As young students who are intellectuals, they should be deeply vigilant, study hard, conduct thorough research, and diligently work within their duties, and bear the responsibility of knowledge for academics and culture.</p>
<p>Ibsen has a famous saying: "You must mold this material into a useful tool." In addition to receiving education at school, young students must also pay attention to self-cultivation and鍛鍊 themselves into useful people. True gold is refined in fire. If young people want to hope to achieve something and do something, then they must go through a lot of鍛鍊. As the saying goes, "Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone." Being in the current great era, young people have a good opportunity to grasp the opportunity to砥礪鍊, and I hope everyone cherishes it!</p>

<h3>Anglo-American-French Note to the Bonn Council: West German Constitution Relaxes Restrictions; General Agreement Reached Between Two Major German Parties on Federal Finances and Legislative Powers</h3>
<p>[Reuter, Bonn, 24th] Leaders of the parties in the West German Constituent Assembly have reached agreement on key points in drafting the constitution, with only one point remaining to be negotiated, namely the teaching of religious subjects in national schools. The Social Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Party still have different opinions on this point. In the 48 hours before the party leaders reached a general agreement, the Allies had submitted a softened note to the German leaders, relaxing the restrictions on drafting the West German constitution. Regarding the distribution of financial and legislative powers between the federal and state governments, the party leaders have drafted an agreed formula, the details of which have been submitted to the three military governors for review at a meeting with the German leaders tomorrow. On the financial side, the Allies' recommendation has been accepted, agreeing that each state will establish a tax bureau, but the federal government may also collect certain types of taxes to maintain its own expenditures. The new proposal on legislative powers stipulates that the powers of the federal parliament will be slightly reduced, but less than what the Social Democrats had advocated. Laws relating to local taxes in each state will be subsidized by the federal government in terms of finance. The laws of each state and those relating to state borders and the establishment of new federal authorities must still be approved by the federal parliament. In addition to the financial and legislative proposals, the other parties are prepared to agree in principle to the Social Democrats' request to shorten the content of the draft constitution, but on the point of religious education, the Christian Democrats are still unwilling to pass a provision that parents decide on their children's religious education. The Social Democrats suggested today that this matter be determined by each state, as the right to education is usually in the hands of the state governments. The leaders of the Constituent Assembly hope that this issue of religious education can be resolved as soon as possible so that the final constitution can be passed in early May and submitted to the general assembly for a final vote in mid-May. If this is the case, elections can be expected to be held before the harvest, so that a government can be established in the summer.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 25th] A new memorandum expressing the views of the United States, Britain, and France on German basic law has been sent to the German parliamentary committee in Bonn. It states that the three foreign ministers cannot currently agree to include Berlin in the initial organization of the German Federal Republic. The memorandum also reveals that the Allies will give "sympathetic consideration" to any provision that promotes the "financial independence and proper strength" of the state and federal governments. The stalemate in the West German constitution is due to disagreements between the two major parties in the Bonn Constituent Assembly, one being the powerful Social Democratic Party and the other being the more conservative Christian Democratic Party. The Socialist Party, which controls about one-third of the votes in parliament, has called for the establishment of a strong central government in West Germany. The Christian Democratic Party advocates a loose federation that emphasizes the rights of the provinces, a plan that is more in line with the general views of the three foreign ministers.</p>
<h3>Congress in Support of World Peace: 100,000 People Demonstrate in Paris, Holding Anti-War Banners and Singing the Internationale</h3>
<p>[Reuter, Paris, 24th] More than 100,000 people in support of peace gathered from cities in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands to demonstrate in support of the World Peace Congress. They held banners and olive branches. Some came by bus or train, some by car, and others by foot or bicycle, gathering in the stadium, and traffic in the vicinity was cut off.</p>
<p>For more than an hour, when buses from Fontainebleau, the headquarters of Marshal Montgomery, arrived, the crowd shouted "Monty, go home!" "Monty, get out!" (Monty is the short name for Marshal Montgomery) When delegates to the Peace Congress, including Bishop Johnson of Canterbury, French atomic scientist Joliot-Curie, Italian Socialist leader Nenni, and Soviet representatives, arrived, the crowd cheered. The slogans held by the crowd included "Long live the Franco-Soviet alliance," "Peace in Indonesia," "Peace in Viet Minh," "The Atlantic Pact is a death pact," and "French mothers will never allow their sons to participate in a war against the Soviet Union." Three Greek girls dressed as farmers held a banner that read "The Greek people are fighting for peace." The representatives of the 50 countries of the Peace Congress and the demonstrators marched around the track in the stadium.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] Today, the crowd marched and sang "La Marseillaise" and Communist youth songs. Curie, the host of French atomic energy research, declared to the crowd, "We will resolutely resist those who commit the heinous crime of inciting war in the name of democracy, freedom, and peace. We declare here that our entire responsibility is peace. We will surely win." American writer Howard Fast said, "Freedom of opinion in the United States is often only an illusion. American prisons are often full of political prisoners. I wish I could say that my people will refuse war, but I only know that millions of American workers want peace."</p>

<h3>Tenants' General Federation Expresses Dissent to Draft Amendments to Housing Rent Standards</h3>
<p>The city government has finalized the amendments to the housing rent standards in this city, which will be implemented after being discussed and approved by the City Council. Upon hearing this news, the Tenants' General Federation of this city held an emergency meeting and unanimously resolved that the draft proposed by the city government differs greatly from the content of the City Council's previous resolution to revise the maximum rent limit. They firmly expressed their opposition and requested that the City Council seriously revise it for the sake of the livelihood of citizens and the stability of social order. Their reasons for opposition are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The original proposal of the City Council was to revise the maximum rent limit. However, Article 1 of the current method stipulates that the rental amount should be agreed upon by the landlord and tenant. Only when an agreement cannot be reached will the provisions of the method apply. The intention of this is the opposite of the provision for a maximum limit. The provision for a maximum limit is a rigid law, while the current method is too flexible and will hardly have legal effect. (2) According to the 7,000-fold and 9,000-fold method passed by the City Council in March of last year, the increase in living expenses from March to the end of August of last year was added. Assuming that the calculation was made at the beginning of September of last year using legal tender converted to gold yuan certificates, then one yuan of pre-war rent, when adjusted to gold yuan certificates, would only be 4.2 to 5.2 fen (equivalent to 4% and 5.2%). However, the current method adjusts it to 15% or 25%, which is too high. (3) Since housing rent is divided into several grades according to the amount of pre-war rent, and commercial housing was originally higher than residential housing before the war, it is inappropriate to further increase the percentage on the base number.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Pays Salaries in Silver Dollars: Ministry of Finance Orders Recall</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Premier He of the Executive Yuan recently informed various agencies in Shanghai that they are not allowed to issue so-called contingency funds. It was also stipulated that except for combat troops who may be paid in silver dollars, no other agency may pay salaries in silver dollars to avoid disturbing public morale and affecting social order. It is now reported that the Bank of China, without authorization, paid its employees in silver dollars as contingency evacuation funds. Upon learning of this news, the Ministry of Finance considered it a violation of government regulations and has ordered the bank to recall the funds by a certain date to comply with the law.</p>
<h3>Cash Shortage Expected to Improve Today: Business Market Sluggish, Mostly Just Settling Accounts</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] As the situation changes rapidly, transactions in various industries yesterday mostly took a "sweep before your own door" attitude. In addition, negotiable instruments are not valid for same-day use, which has been repeated. Firms with capital lent out have withdrawn it to cope with possible storms. This has created a phenomenon of tightness outside the industry while it's loose inside the industry. However, the daily interest rate has fallen back to between 200 and 300 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Market prices in general, except for vegetables in the small vegetable market, have fallen drastically.</p>
<p>Yesterday, most commercial markets were not receptive to promissory note transactions. On the retail side, many refused to accept them, which created an unprecedented cash shortage. The discount rate for promissory notes has risen to over 30%. The Central Bank stated that since government agencies at all levels have relocated to Shanghai, coupled with frequent military and government disbursements, the need for cash is even more than in the past. Therefore, the withdrawal amount for general commercial firms is only 10% of the previous day's deposits. However, according to a person in charge of the National Bank who spoke to reporters, the amount of temporary disbursements from the national treasury will be less starting today, so the supply of general cash is expected to increase. Because various firms were unable to collect cash yesterday morning, the cash position was particularly tight in the morning. In the evening, as part of the cash collected by various parties came out, it became looser, and the market for various financial items also rebounded.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Yesterday, transactions in various markets were few. Most major markets were mostly dealing with unfinished business, and new transactions were temporarily suspended. All market prices were only nominal. The financial market also reported losses. Interbank lending decreased sharply, and all parties adopted a cautious attitude. Industrial and commercial firms used gold as collateral to banks. In the early morning, the price was 450 million yuan, but later, as speculators dumped gold and banknotes to pay off debts, the market price fell again to 350 million yuan, with more selling than buying. Except for banks with surplus capital who took the opportunity to buy at low prices, there were few buyers. Industrial and commercial firms and speculators, due to capital constraints, had no choice but to use gold and banknotes as collateral at low prices for loans and borrowing. Most of the transactions involved liquidation, and interest rates were chaotic.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Transactions Few, Silver Dollars Initially Weak but Later Firm</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday in the gold market, the price inside the market remained unchanged at the upper limit of 21.672 million yuan. In the off-exchange futures market, customer and company transactions were settled at 63 million yuan. Spot transactions were chaotic, between 300 million and 400 million yuan, and transactions were few. Off-exchange US dollar transactions were also chaotic. In street transactions, 6.5 yuan in US dollars exchanged for 10 yuan in silver dollars, only about 300,000 yuan. Same-day spot transactions were quoted between 700,000 and 800,000 yuan, also informal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage was completely suspended. Street transactions were initially weak but later firm. In the morning, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation, various orders flowed back to Shanghai. With public morale stabilizing, supply exceeded demand, and there was a wave of selling. Silver dollars once fell below 300,000 yuan, down to 270,000 and 320,000 yuan. It rose slightly to 300,000 and 350,000 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, due to a large amount of contingency funds flowing out, banks and companies tried their best to collect them, and the price rose to 400,000 yuan in the evening. Small silver dollars were quoted at 300,000 and 350,000 yuan, and foreign silver dollars were quoted at 220,000 and 270,000 yuan. Due to general panic, the price of promissory notes was 50% higher than the price of cash. Silver dollars traded at 400,000 and 500,000 yuan in the morning and rose to 600,000 and 650,000 yuan in the afternoon, not much different from last weekend.</p>
<p>Yesterday, jewelry stores selling gold jewelry suspended business due to the chaotic market conditions and did not post prices all day. Money exchange shops also did not post prices.</p>
<p>Cloth Trading: Suspended</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was deserted due to the sudden change in the situation. Everyone was suspicious and dared not act rashly, and trading was suspended. As for the factories opening for business, most of them calculated prices using silver dollars, but there were few inquiries. Wholesale prices were very chaotic, with Four Gentlemen poplin ranging from 5 yuan to 5.8 yuan, and 190 Prussian Blue ranging from 11 yuan to 15 yuan. Business was also quite sluggish. The nearby towns were close to the war zone and had no intention of buying goods, and "single runners" had disappeared due to transportation problems.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks Neglected</p>
<p>The stock exchange yesterday stipulated that the morning and afternoon sessions would be calculated as one trading area and announced that starting today, 50% of the clearing deposit will be collected for the remaining balance of the day's clearing transactions. Due to the wait-and-see attitude, the market was neglected. Yongsha initially traded at 300 yuan, then immediately stopped rising. Other stocks were also rarely priced. Taiwan Sugar and Rongfeng both stopped rising, Jingfu fell to the limit at 11:05, and Huafeng also fell to 4.42 yuan at that time. Meiya initially traded at 6.2 yuan, once rose to 6.84 yuan, and finally fell to 5 yuan. Hengfeng also closed at the lower limit. As a result, there were mixed increases and decreases compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The market's mood became increasingly cold, and the market atmosphere was deserted, with few offers. Yongsha initially traded at 290 yuan and then rose to 300 yuan. Later, it gradually cooled down and closed at 275 yuan, down 20 yuan from the afternoon price, but still up 24 yuan from last Saturday. Meiya initially traded at 5.2 yuan, once fell to 4.8 yuan, and finally traded at 5.8 yuan. Huafeng and Xinguang moved in different directions, with Xinguang falling 8 jiao compared to the afternoon, and Huafeng rising 5.8 jiao compared to the afternoon. Lianan, Guohuo, and Rongfeng all closed at the upper limit. The total trading volume for the day was 416.6 million shares, including 30.3 million shares of Yongsha.</p>
<p>There were no transactions in gold bonds in the morning or afternoon.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Plummet</p>
<p>Yesterday in the grain market, because bank notes were absolutely not allowed to be used on the same day, buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see approach, and most transactions were suspended. All parties were rushing to settle matters. However, rice was still traded. Due to the drastic changes in the situation, various parties sold, and white rice plummeted to 2.3 million yuan, equivalent to 5.5 silver dollars. The off-exchange prices of other flour, cooking oil, and grains all plummeted in unison. When converted to silver dollars, bingchuan was quoted at 1.5 yuan, and lao che was quoted at 1.8 yuan, but there were few inquiries. Soybean oil was quoted at 27 yuan, crude oil was quoted at 26 yuan, crude rapeseed oil was quoted at 24 yuan, Sangyuan soybeans were quoted at 4 yuan, and Hankou yellow sesame was quoted at 8 yuan, all plummeting by 30% to 40%.</p>
<h3>Headless Female Corpse Found on Fanhangdu Road: Suspected Owner of Guangming Barber Shop Flees with Entire Family</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A headless female corpse was discovered in the mud of a stinking river in Jinjia Lane, Fanhangdu Road, West Shanghai, at around 6:00 AM yesterday. The deceased was about thirty years old, completely naked, and covered with a burlap sack. After someone reported it to the Jiangning Road Police Substation, officers were dispatched to investigate and learned that the Guangming Barber Shop was located in a wooden shed nearby. The shop owner had a violent argument with his wife and concubines the night before over family matters. After dawn, the entire family abandoned the shop and fled, which seemed suspicious. After officers investigated the shop, they found blood stains and messy footprints, indicating that the victim was likely his concubine. The officers in charge are now searching for the shop owner to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Cash Shortage Returns: Central Bank Cashes in Cheaply</h3>
<p>After shops refused to accept bank notes and checks, the cash shortage has become severe again.</p>
<p>Shops are guarding against the sudden closing of banks.</p>
<p>The Gold Management Bureau yesterday ordered all industries to prohibit the refusal of accepting notes. But all industries still refuse to accept them. What to do?</p>
<p>The only solution is to release cash. It is reported that a large amount of cash was released into the market yesterday afternoon. It may ease today.</p>
<p>Starting last Friday, the Central Bank stopped actively collecting silver dollars and instead passively collected silver dollars.</p>
<p>The market price of silver dollars plummeted, and the Central Bank passively collected a large number of cheap silver dollars. This is a good strategy, so even though there is an urgent need for military silver dollars, the Central Bank is still adopting a passive silver dollar collection policy. And silver dollar merchants who need cash must actively sell to the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Heavy, cumbersome things, market prices are falling day by day. The reason, of course, is the overall situation. The immediate reason is the tight cash and the refusal to accept notes. So even though it's falling, there are still few transactions, and it has almost become a deadlock with prices but no market.</p>
<p>Because of the extreme shortage of cash, bare trading not only has two prices, cash price and note price, but also the note price is five or six times higher than the cash price.</p>
<p>It's truly shocking.</p>
