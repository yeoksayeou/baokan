<h3>上海爲全國精華所在　共軍不致襲攻　今後生活或有相當改變顏等昨應潘公展等邀宴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市參議會議長潘公展，副議長徐寄廎，地方協會會長杜月笙，交通銀行董事長錢新之，全國商會聯合會主席王曉籟五氏，昨日中午在杜公館爲甫由京飛滬之顏惠慶·章士釗·江庸三和平老人洗塵，代表上海市民致其慰勞之誠·杜氏昨雖抱病，但仍親與長談。席間再無他人，彼此互相交換意見，對和平均抱持堅强之信心，日昨和平使團三氏蒞滬後，對和平消息雖堅守緘默，不輕外洩，但據本報記者從各人談話口吻中間，似已略可窺見其未來和談之輸廓。其可注意者，爲：（一）政府與中共之和談代表人數當可相同，爲集思廣益，俾雙方得充分討論，或可多於每方四人以上·（二）張羣抵京後，迭次參與重要會商，可能乃政府或將推派張氏爲和談代表之一的一種象徵。（三）政府必須先求內部團結，成爲一個整體，則和談自可較易進行。（四）和談之條件，當然須待和談開始以後，由彼此磋商進行之，而此次和平代表團之任務爲敲門工作，當不涉及此範圍。（五）上海爲全國工商業精華之所在，破壞上海，必致損及全國元氣，此點大概爲雙方共有之認識；且中共領袖似亦未有想到用武力襲攻上海。（六）無論如何，今後人民生活方式或有相當改變；但共方於其佔領較大都市如濟南，北平，天津後，其作風似較從前在內地城鄉時有所差別。</p>
<h3>平等基礎進行和談　本月中旬卽可開始　政府指定十人起草方案　孫院長招待記者解說當前各問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕行政院長孫科三日晨正式宣布：政府與中共之和平談判，將於本月十五日以後開始進行，政府現正加緊研究和談方案。孫氏稱：上海人民和平代表團顏惠慶·江庸·章士釗·邵力子四氏自北平歸來，轉達共方意見，謂中共已願與政府在平等基礎上進行和談，舉例言之，如雙方和談代表人數，中共願與政府相等，中共負責人並表示最好能於三月十五日以後開始和談。李代總統爲此，特於本月一日下午四時召集中樞及地方首要會談，並指定十人，負責硏究起草政府方面之和談方案，研究工作現已開始，希望於十日內完成。此十位要員爲：邵力子·張治中·張羣·何應欽·吳忠信·朱家驊·劉斐·吳鐵城·鍾天心·孫科，由孫科任主席。孫氏强調稱：此項方案正硏究中，內容如何，尙未決定。惟爲避免誤會，影響和談，在向中共提出並經正式同意以前，不便公開發表。</p>
<p>孫氏係應首都各報記者之請，於三日上午十時半在國際聯歡社舉行長達一小時半之記者招待會，就當前若千重要問題加以解說，尤特別注重和平問題，此外並答覆各記者之詢問。招待會舉行時，副院長吳鐵城，外部次長葉公超等均參加。出席之中外記者達四十餘人。孫氏之報吿包括（一）和平進行問題，（二）革新政治問題。關於革新政治，孫氏列舉役政·糧政·幣値·土地改革等項，一一加以說明。</p>
<p>和平進行問題爲當前人民所最重視之問題，孫氏首就此點詳述其經過。孫氏稱：上月中，李代總統赴滬邀請顏惠慶·江庸·章士釗三氏，及政府方面之邵力子氏赴北平後，業經返扺首都。本人自廣州來京，已與四氏會面，聽到報吿，其內容未便由本人發表，蓋以諸事均在商討準備中，未到公開之時期。顏等四氏在北平·石家莊二地曾與中共主要負責人接談，所得資料極爲寳貴，並帶來新希望，和平前途困難雖多，但希望甚大。雙方現巳理解，今後將以對和平之努力程度決定今後國家之命運及前途。本人於兩個月前主持政院時，卽主張應進行和平，抗戰八年，內戰三年，兵連禍結，民不堪命，今後最大問題為如何設法達到實現和平之目標。在政院與諸同仁在蔣總統領導下，曾磋商若干次，其後蔣總統根據大家意見及其本人之考慮，認爲中國需要和平，乃發表元且文吿，倡導和平。蔣總統之元旦文吿，表示政府已有以政治方法謀取和平之準備與決心，半月後獲悉中共主席毛澤東氏之對時局聲明，其中曾提及八項條件。當時政府方面所躊躇顧慮者，卽政府方面爲軍事失敗，中共方面爲軍事勝利，吾人憂慮中共以戰勝者自居，以戰敗者視政府，採取國際慣例，和平條件均由戰勝國提出，戰敗國只能俯首聽命，而無提出意見之權利。若然，則和平之困難殊多，且不易克服，故本人當時提出簡單主張，應取得光榮和平，卽雙方以平等地位來談和，均可提出條件，無限制交換意見，辯論，俾獲一結果。根據平等談和，所獲結果始能公平合理，雙方始能心悅誠服，共同接受。此次和平代表團自平歸來，說明中共確有謀和誠意，亦有此諒解，卽雙方以平等地位商談和平，中共表示，現在雙方均正準備中，希望能於本月十五日以後開始商談，政府方面因亦根據此點加緊準備。</p>

<h3>立法院會今舉行　將研討促進全國和平案　孫科吳鐵城邀宴到京全體立委</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三“電〕立法院第三會期第二次會議，定四日晨九時舉行，討論事項中僅列張匯文等提請舉行全院談話會，硏討如何促請全國和平案。又蕭覺天等十二人提議，請提前確認政府保護人民基本自由及釋放政治犯等四項文吿爲必要措置，內稱：政府於一月廿三日頒有四項文吿，卽取消戒嚴令，保護人民身體自由，不准非法逮捕拘禁，保護言論自由，不准濫封報社，取消特務組織及特別法庭，釋放學生及政治犯，恢復民盟地位以及釋放張學良·楊虎城等，是皆本院之所期求，亦卽全國人民之所願望者，乃迄今並未切實執行，或因程序問題，减低行政效率，甚至自由行動，特工外繼續捕人，藐法違令，莫此爲甚，値茲本院復會伊始，爲民衆爭取自由，對於政府四項文吿，認爲必要措　應由院會提前加以確認，責成政院負責切實執行，各軍政首長如再故違，應予撤懲，以平民怨，而眾法令。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕孫科，吳鐵城三日午在國際聯歡社邀宴全體到京立委，到二百餘人，孫氏曾就政院遷穗事有所聲明，並重申爭取和平之信心，謂人民亟需和平，政府爲順應民意，對和平將盡最大之努力，只要能有眞正的光榮的和平，個人及黨派利益之犧牲，均在所不計。爲達成此一目的，必須舉國團結，以期爭取光榮和平之實現，立法院長童冠賢亦應邀參加，渠卽席發言，對孫氏努力爭取和平之決心，表示贊同，並謂，和平須有建設性，而改革政治，應與和平同時進行，宴會至下午二時始散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕立法委員中反對孫科之空氣仍極濃厚，三日下午三時舉行立委第二次談話會時，已有充分表現。此次談話會係由黃宇人，甘家馨，江一平，陳博生，范予遂，費俠，劉伯閔，湯如炎，陳顧遠等廿四人聯名邀集者，出席立委達二百人，由江一平主席，有人主張致函孫科，請其「光榮辭職」，然此議因各委員意見不盡相同，並未能作決定，大抵仍將循「合法手續」，于院會中孫氏報吿施政方針時以質詢之方式爲之。三日談話會之情緒頗呈激昂，發言者有廿四人，分析和談及政治革新兩問題，唯均未獲結論。最後僅決定由四日院會中決議通電全國擁護李代總統之和平主張。關於和平問題，決定廣泛交換意見後，再作提案，此項提案須先交付審查，至和平細則，則待和談開始後再作商討，至六時散會。</p>
<h3>蘇浙區監委行署　對衛總提抗議　謂抵觸憲法規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕企圖顚覆政府大陰謀案經本報揭發後，各方人士頗爲重視，並表震驚，惟監院蘇浙區監委行署對於執法機關處置經過，在手續上容有不合，引爲遺憾。據稱該署已向首都衛戍部備文提出嚴重抗議。據該署監委倪弼稱：首都衛總稽查處長逮捕許志遠時，係深夜率領軍警翻牆入署挾持而去，並搜去該署公文三宗，旣未出示拘票，又未吿知該署主管人以拘捕理由及給付收據，亦未於法定時間內移送有審判權之機關審理。倪氏稱：此點「顯與憲法提審法刑事訴訟法之規定不合。」至許志遠本人係於去年九月該署成立時，經人介紹到署，並依法取得保證書始派任薦任調查專員，平日言行尙無異狀，究是否參加「顚覆政府陰謀」，應基於證據依法判定。該署除正進行調查眞象外，暫不置詞。同時倪氏對外傳該案有關人士之一之孟士衡係該署職員一點，聲明該署並無其人。</p>

<h3>賴樸翰的援華建議</h3>
<p>美國經濟合作總署中國分署署長賴樸翰，於上月十五日返美述職，向經合總署署長霍夫曼報吿中國分署之工作情形。此舉雖屬尋常事件，惟因美國在中國政局動盪不定的今日是否繼續援助中國，却爲我全國人民最關切的問題，故對於賴氏返國述職之行，吾人自懷無限的期望。再加以現行援華計劃的期限，即將屆滿，所剩餘的援華基金，亦爲數不多，賴氏返國轉瞬將及半月，迄未見賴氏有何具體表示，更增加中國人民對於美援是否繼續的迫切關懷。</p>
<p>但至日昨，賴樸翰著長終於打破了沉默，提出他繼續援華的建議了。據美國合衆社華府一日電稱：賴樸翰署長巳在華府向經合總署建議，立即向國會提出給予中國人民兩億四千萬美元經濟合作貸款的請求，此項援華計劃的期限仍定爲一年，以每月二千萬美元計算，自今年六月三十日起至明年六月三十日爲止，共需經費二億四千萬美元。同時，賴氏本人也向報界談稱：「余亟願出席國會，要求繼續援華；但此項經濟合作計劃，並非軍事援助，吾人在目前所在的地區，只要該區域不淪入中共之手，吾人就應該繼續進行援華工作。目前中國的救濟費用，每月約二千萬美元，如吾人决定採取不在任何中共佔領區內繼續辦下去的政策，則於一年之內恐無需二億四千萬美元之鉅·」</p>
<p>我們雖沒有看到賴氏繼續援華計劃的詳細內容，但聽到賴氏道一番談括，充滿了友邦人士對於中國人民的珍貴同情，實在不能不有所感。中國是一個產業落後的國家，過去雖然也號稱「以農立國」，但因生產方式的故步自封，不求改進，連日夜辛苦耕耘的農民，竟不免於凍餒，根本談不到工業化的問題。近復以八年抗戰與三年內爭，早巳把全國人民衣食所依的農村，毀壞得支離破碎，比到十年前的面目，更加完全改觀了。在這種情况之下，中國人民自然希望友邦能够授手援溺，其動機並非依靠外援，以解決戰後的民生問題，其眞正的目的乃在以此爲復興經濟的資本。可是戰後三年以來，中國人民又做了塲惡夢，聯合國善後救濟總署的來華工作，美國政府在經濟上源源援華，均未能拯救中國人民出於水火。中國人民對於自己本身未能善用外援，將外來的援助化爲自己的血和肉，作爲將來復興的張本，固然感到無限的內疚和慚愧；但對於外援的忽冷忽熱，援助的分量旣嫌不足，而援助的物資又往往與需要不合，也不能不表示遺憾。所以中國人民雖巳深切了解自身努力的重要，沒有不把一自力更生」「自求多福」，奉爲金科玉律，但至今猶盼望友邦的全力援助。我們在賴氏返國之際，曾表示此願望，現在聽到賴氏的談話，沒有使我們失望。但我們研究此一援華計劃的性質，純屬慈善救濟性質，充其量不過是一種「零碎」援助而已。</p>
<p>二千萬美元一月的經濟合作經費，在我國國計民生搞到山窮水盡的今日，固然不能認爲是一筆微小不足道的款項，但若欲以此作爲我國經濟復興的資本，仍不免有杯水車薪之感，義援和僅以此爲限，不再另外有其他方面的援助，則此一年以內二億四千萬美元的經濟合作經費，祗能視爲美國對於多苦多難的中國人民的一種佈施而已，仍未必即能發生起死回生的作用。所以我們希望美國朝野眞能放大眼光，對於援華千萬不可再抱一忽冷忽然」的態度，要援助就該全力援助，軍事經濟雙管齊下，始能達成其援華的目的，否則零零碎碎，仍不能使中國有復興經濟的打算，將來還不免於貽誤大局。</p>
<p>談到美國援華問題，無不承認在今日中美之間，有着一個普遍的錯覺，就是在美國人看來，終覺得中國自身的努力不夠，而誤會中國人專門癡心妄想美國的全力援助。杜魯門總統就曾警吿中國過，他說。。「美援不能代替你們本身的努力」。但在中國人民看來，則覺得零零碎碎的美援，好比杯水車薪，無濟於事，而希望美國實事求是，予以有效的援助。這兩種相左的意見，都不免太主觀了一些，我們希望中國本身的努力能配合得上美國的援助，美國的援助也能配合得上中國自身的努力。</p>
<p>要之，美國繼續並擴大援助中國的動向，已在賴樸翰氏的建議中見其端倪。但我們切望美國全力援華早日見諸事實。勿使中國人民再生冷熱之感，而我們也更要自備自惕，埋頭苦幹，不問外援之有無多少，但救自身的刻苦努力！</p>

<h3>古都情調編入樂曲　舊金山管弦樂隊上海「北平胡同」</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處舊金山二日電〕北平市街自晨至幕之音樂情調。由阿符夏洛莫夫編爲樂曲，最近由舊金山管弦樂隊在音樂會中加以演奏</p>
<p>此一作品題各「北平胡同」。阿符夏洛莫夫將北平小販，理髮者，賣麵者，以及其他小商人所作具有音樂節奏之叫賣聲，改編爲樂曲。按比等叫賣聲，係用以吸引顧客者。</p>
<p>阿符夏洛莫夫在晤見記者時謂：「中國爲世界上最具有音樂趣味國家之一，本人居留於中國之許多年中·從未遇見一無音樂情味之人物。」渠以北平挑水者之叫喊聲爲例，以證明此點。</p>
<p>阿符夏洛莫夫之興味，完全休中於中國音樂，渠曾在中國過其大部份生活。渠生於西伯利亞東部之一小村中，接近中國邊境，渠早年卽對其隣國之音樂發生興趣。</p>

<p>關於役政，孫氏指出此爲對人民之最大苛，抗戰前政府爲充實國防，制定兵役法，實行征兵，對抗戰勝利，其功不小。然抗戰後仍繼續征兵，因事實上未能完成理想，兵役法規之施行變質，成爲苛擾，農村人民痛苦尤甚，因之，同人等主張取消征兵，改爲募兵制。募兵制可使人民有願否當兵之自由，故征兵制極應取消，孫氏於論及役政時，並提及政府軍費支出之浩大，謂，我政府預算中，軍費支出比例之高，爲全世界各國冠，人民負担以是亦最重。渠提及初到政院時，聽說全國有官兵六百三十萬人，嚇了一跳，渠認爲抗戰最高潮時，官兵亦不過此數，然現在不論實際有無此數，所有軍餉給養均照此數發給，政府無法負担。當時主張减至五百八十萬人，財糧當局認爲仍須核减，兩週前財長·糧長·主計長曾擬核减爲四百二十萬人，本人認爲四百二十萬人仍太多，故於一星期前提出兵額應縮至二百五十萬人·當時討論未獲結果，國防部認爲困難太多，兵額减至四百二十萬，已减無可減。財政。糧食當局則認爲，最多不能超過三百萬人，否則卽無法負担，現在此事尙未解決。李代總統日前蒞穗，會談及此事，李代總統有此同感，認爲非減縮不可，故有整軍之議，軍事改革爲政府當前急務，否則財政無辦法，人民負担不能減輕，物價無法穩定，通貨膨脹無法停止。</p>
<p>廢止征糧制度民選地方首長</p>
<p>土地法應徹底施行</p>
<p>除征兵外，尙有兩事爲人民所苦：一爲糧土地法應澈底施行政，一爲幣値，孫氏稱：抗戰時爲充實軍食，實行征糧，並附帶徵借，實行迄今，弊端百出，農村負担　重，且憑空養出「糧官」十數萬人，但所微者不足軍食之半，仍須政府出資購買，此種制度，不僅苛擾人民，政府亦覺浪費，故決予廢止。目前幣值日貶，物價波動至鉅，人民生活均受威脅，根本解決之策爲恢復和平，停止軍事行動，大量裁軍，减少軍費支出。現僅就治標着手，卽最近政院通過之財政金融改革案，准許金銀自由買賣流通，鼓鑄銀元，兵餉改發銀元等。關稅改收關元，目的爲確保稅收價値，俾政府收支能漸趨於平衡。孫氏復承認政府過去　若干過錯，如國民政府成立廿餘年，地方自治基礎迄未建立，中央過份集權，使地方政治形成麻木狀態。憲法中規定中央地方分權，姑不論此憲法將來如何，目前仍應澈底實行，權責分明，權限分淸，地方首長亦應實行民選。關於土地改革，孫氏稱：立法院在胡漢民院長時代卽制定土地法，但迄未澈底實行，中央僅實行抽土地稅一部分，今後仍應根據治法精神，簡化條文，予以施行。土地法係根據民生主義精神而制定，非因中共實行土地改革，而吾人始效法也。</p>
<p>政院遷穗辦公經代總統同意</p>
<p>外間誤會實屬遺憾</p>
<p>孫院長並稱：近來外間對於行政院遷穗辦公，頗有誤會·實則政府南移，遠在本人接長行政院之前，京中軍政機關卽已有此準備與行動，　以江北戰事日緊，共軍前鋒已抵距浦口不及十五公里之地，首都感受威脅，行政院各部會經李代總統核可後，始行遷往廣州辦公，總統府秘書處及其他院會機關，大部份人員亦紛紛遷離南京，以策安全，本人因行政院遷穗辦公，經於一月廿六日正式通吿友邦使節，隨同遷應。嗣經李代總統同意，本人並於二月四日偕吳副院長赴廣州一行，不料外間不明眞相之人士，對此頗多揣測，殊屬遺憾。本人此次回京，得與然君重聚一堂，至感愉快。所深切希望者，諸君亟應與政府密切合作，使政府謀取和平與改革政治之願望，得以早日實現，全國廣大之民衆，實利賴之。</p>
<p>即席答覆記者十項重要問題</p>
<p>在京事畢卽返廣州</p>
<p>孫氏之說明歷四十五分鐘始畢，其後卽席答覆各記者提出之問題，其重要者有：（一）外傳府院間對和平問題意見未盡相同，確否？孫氏稱，並無不同意見。（二）孫院長是否返穩，抑仍留京？孫氏稱：當然要回廣州，廣州是政府所在地，南京爲和談中心，不能不兩面兼顧。一俟此間事辦了，卽返廣州。（三）此次疏散，政院若干部會未能妥善處理，致影響省市公務及職員工作情緒，是否將有所處理？孫氏稱：當查明情形，分別研究決定。（四）聞行政院將局部改組，人事有無決定？孫氏稱：尙朱決定，故不能作具體報吿。（五）由聯合國調停中共問題是否有效？孫氏稱：本人認爲聯合國調停效力甚微，不若直接談商爲妥。中國政府爲貫激企求和平之初衷，當然歡迎各方面之協助，惟聯合國以憲章之規定所限，不容易參加調停某一國之國內問題。（六）伊瓦特發表請聯合國調停時，孫院長曾表示歡迎，現在又謂不容易調停，是否兩次之間局勢業已不同？孫氏稱：調停應爲雙方接受始能有效，伊瓦特發言後，中共曾表示反對，故聯合國之調停不會有效。（七）李代總統宣布之七項措施，政府當局何以未能實行？孫氏稱：此七項措施，行政院曾予討論決定，其中一二項因技術問題，交國防部硏究，所謂朱施行者，卽係在國防部硏究中。（八）台費省政府限制人民入境，是否爲行政院之命令？孫氏稱：政院無此命令，想係地方當局之措施。（九）報載工商部長劉維熾有貪汚情事，孫院長有所聞否？孫氏稱：此事已見報載，未知詳情。聞監察院正進行調查。（十）孫院長對齊步　同之長函有何批評？孫氏稱：本人尚未見到此函，此係出自私人誤會，爲一法律問題。</p>

<p>認爲蘇聯·保加利亞·匈牙利·波蘭·羅馬尼亞及捷克六國組成軍事同盟，以對抗北大西洋聯盟，一如一月前蘇聯宣布組織經濟同盟以對抗馬歇爾計劃，不無可能。華沙可靠方面今日報吿稱，東歐軍事會議或將於月中在匈牙利特白勒森地方舉行，東歐各國軍事將領均將出席·此間某國觀察家謂此種會議早已舉行過幾次，但匈官方則否認東歐各國將領會在該國境內舉行過任何談話。</p>

<h3>美B.50型巨機利用空中加油　可轟炸蘇任何基地　「幸運夫人第二號」在美空軍史上，已獲得驚人成果。</h3>
<p>〔聯合社德克撒斯州華茲堡二日電〕美國空軍今日完成有史以來初次環球不着陸飛行，波音式B-50型中轟炸機「幸運夫人第二」號，廿六日載同機員十四人自此間卡斯威爾空軍基地秘密向東起飛後，已於今日標準時間下午三時廿二分（上海時間下午十一時廿二分）安然返防，費時九十四小時零一分，全程共計飛行二萬三千四百廿五哩，平均時速爲二三九哩，沿途利用油機在空中加油四次。卒能完成該項驚人創舉。降落時空軍都要員均到機塲熱烈歡迎，當局認爲試飛結果已獲得若干戰略上之重要教訓。據駕駛該機之正機師加拉格上校在記者招待會報吿，謂此事證明B-50型機可隨時轟炸全世界任何地區。或問空軍戰略部長李梅利用空軍加油方法是否能對蘇聯境內各地投擲原子彈，李氏略一鑄躇後答稱，「不如說可對需要原子彈之各地投彈」。此次飛行路綫事前曾商得沿途各國同意，惟小心避免飛臨蘇聯上空，其與蘇聯最接近之處在喀剌蚩一段，尙與蘇境相距數百哩。戰時以原子彈轟炸廣島與長崎者爲B-29型超級堡壘，戰後則由B-50型取而代有其地位。該機飛過亞速爾羣島，B-29型機接到無綫電通知，卽自拉根斯機塲升空等候，爲之加油。第二次加油在沙地阿刺伯之達蘭奇，較預定計劃早二小時五十五分。第三次加油在菲列賓，較預定早一小時廿五分，第四次加油在夏威夷，早五十八分鐘。最後返抵此間管制塔上空，與預定計劃幾乎分毫不爽。另據李氏宣稱，此次秘密飛行之一目的，在探測空中四次加油之軍事安全程度與能否完成飛行而不洩漏秘密。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社舊金山二日電〕「幸運夫人第二號」曾利用油機兩架爲輔，在空中添油，利用此種油機，使蘇聯任何基地，均在美國轟炸機羣航程之內。</p>
<p>〔合衆社德克薩斯州華茲堡二日電〕美新式B-50型轟炸機「幸運夫人第二」號，巳於二日返回至原來機塲上。航空部長薛敏頓，空軍總參謀長樊登堡將軍，空軍戰略司令李梅中將，及第八航空大隊總司令雷密少將皆在塲向該機人員道賀。</p>
<p>〔聯合計華盛頓三日電〕國會議員今日鑒於B-50型轟炸機完成不着陸環球飛行壯舉，重新主張擴充空軍鞏固國防。參院軍事委員會主席泰丁斯宣稱，該項飛行已相當說明第三次世界大戰牽連全人類之程度，空軍對於整個國防益見重要。參院軍事委員會委員均認議會核准添撥空軍經費之希望，巳大爲增强。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市駐防軍隊之副食費，因政府所撥之經費受物價高漲影響後，不敷甚鉅，當經地方當局負責籌劃。市府業已担保其最低限度之實物（卽每人每天柴一斤半，及蔬菜一斤），由軍民合作委員會負責籌劃。據記者昨向有關當局探悉：二月份總計籌得三億元之譜，均係各業同業公會攤派，業經由軍民合作委員會分別撥發各區公所完竣。至於三月份之副副食費總數，迄昨尙未決定，據悉因物價高漲之程度無法預加估計，一且幣制貶値後，必將不敷分配，故當局準備擬具一較澈底之辦法，或將以實物作根據。吳市長定今日下午三時，在市付會議室召集軍民合作委員會，及本市各同業公會代表舉行會議，商討具體辦法。</p>
<h3>市府領到疏散費所傳完全係誤會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於外傳市政府已領到鉅額疏散費消息，昨經市府發言人向記者鄭重加以否認，渠稱絕無此事，純係誤會。蓋本市日前趕築城防工事時，因經費遲遲未見中央撥下，曾由市府向中央銀行請先墊借數億元應急，並以本市目衛特捐作爲抵押。此項費用，日前業經中央撥還市府，故而引起外界誤會，致產生此種謠言云。渠又稱：中央確曾核准軍事吃緊時，負責撥費作疏散之用，惟非至兵臨城下時決不至預撥，故上項傳說，實言之過早云云。</p>
<h3>關元課徵關稅海關尚未奉令</h3>
<p>二月份進口稅收增加</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據江海關稅務司張勇年昨語記者稱，以關元課征稅事，雖財金改革方案巳有明文規定，惟該關尙未接奉正式訓令，故實實尙有待，在未奉令改制前，一切仍照舊有規定辦理。</p>
<p>又據悉：江海關進口稅收，自本年一二兩月份共達十五億元之譜。此中一月份約佔五億，一一月份約佔十億元。二月份稅收之增加，一因貨價步漲，稅收亦隨之膨脹。二因二月份進口校一月份稍見增加。</p>
<p>又外界對金圓劵與關元之結算問題，頗多不明。茲據國行負責方面表示：當日關元對金圓券之比率，係根據隔日（卽上一日）外匯移轉證之收盤價，照每關元合美金四角之比率推算卽得。</p>

<h3>滬杭等地國立大專校長　晉京請願後返滬　調整待遇及經費解決辦法正研議先撥付三月份各校費用及儲糧費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬·杭·蘇·鎭等地十六國立專科以上院校長王之卓·竺可楨。章益。夏堅白等，爲經費待遇及應變費問題，於上月二十七日晚晋京請願，在京曾面謁李代總統，行政院孫院長及教部陳代部長，提出各項請求，關於今後按當地生活指數調整待遇及經費之根本解決辦法，政院正在統盤研議中，卽可獲有決定。爲顧及目前各校經費拮据及教職員工之生活困苦情形，政院先按五百倍標準緊急撥付三月份各校費用共七億六千四百零五萬元，此外並發給各校三個月儲糧費用共四億三千另三十八萬九千元，各校長於獲得成果後於前晚離京，本市各校校長已於昨晨返抵此間。</p>
<p>待遇問題</p>
<p>此次各校長在京向陳代部長提出之具體要求共有九項，詳見前報。陳代部長認爲待遇問題欲依照現有原薪不予折扣，乘當地生活指數計算一點，恐甚難辦到，各校長經考慮後，認爲基數可仍按現有折扣辦法，但倍數堅持須按當地生活指數計算，政院當卽囑各校長造具一大槪預算表，是時滬地二月份下期生活指數六四三倍尙未發表，十六校校長按五百倍估計就各校名額造就二月份應予補發及三月份之經費，學生公費，教授研究費等共計十五億二千八百十萬元，陳代部長認爲數字過鉅，批准一半，按五百倍暫發三月份經費共七億六千四百另五萬元，各校按名額分配，並卽照五百倍發放教職員之薪金，學術硏究費與學生公費。此外學生副食費基數，已自四元二角增至十元，學術研究費提高至正教授二百元，副教授一百五十元，講師一百元，助教五十元。工友底薪平均四十元，技工六十元。</p>
<p>應變費用</p>
<p>應變費問題各校長原要求按所請各費之新標準，一次發給三倍，經孫院長提出折衷辦法，按照各校人口每月每人需米二斗，三個月共六斗算，撥付十六校儲糧費共四億三千另三十八萬九千元。此款孫院長規定祗限供集體儲糧之用，並至緊急時方得動用，購糧及動用情形必須呈報行政院。</p>
<p>此外，各校長因公費生名額日减，而各校貧苦學生日多，要求教部准各校於學生總數中劃定十分之二爲工讀生。陳代部長認爲自前欲增加不可能，但華北各校之公費空額可撥予此間各校，如有需要，各校可就自費生數十分之二之範圍內，自行斟酌情形辦理。</p>
<p>請願各校</p>
<p>此次參加赴京請願領得經費之學校，爲國立交通大學，復旦大學，同濟大學，曁南大學，上海醫學院，上海商學院，吳淞商船專科學校，音樂專科學校，高級機械職業學校，幼稚師範專科學校，浙江大學，河南大學，社會教育學院，江蘇醫學院，藝術專科學校，唐山工學院等十六單位。</p>
<h3>國軍的待遇　一頁將士薪餉表　列兵月入三百金圓祗夠買十五隻燒餅　國防部正籌劃改善辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在備戰謀和的狀態下，上海開到了很多部隊，除去過境軍隊不算外，駐防淞滬的究竟有多少兵力呢？番號和駐紮地點如何呢？這是關乎軍事機密，不能發表，惟整個淞滬警備區總兵力大約在二十萬人左右，分駐在本市四郊。據某軍事機關負責人稱：以現有兵力而論，確保淞滬治安，是不成問題的。因爲駐防和過境的軍隊太多了，營房有限，大部份駐入工廠學校，影響工廠的開工和學校的開學，警備部對此至爲注意，已分別令飭不必要部隊離開上海，駐防部隊儘可能遷出工廠學校，移駐四郊，選擇祠堂廟宇公共塲所駐兵，必要時在郊外建搭帳篷，儘量與市民减少接觸，以整飭軍風紀。過去因過境部隊太多，如經過上海開往台灣·浙·閩的部隊，以及由東北華北撤退來滬的部隊，人數太多，份子複雜，有少數軍人侵入民房，不免有擾民的舉動，經警備部嚴厲整頓後，今後此種現象可望减少。現在部隊的最大問題是待遇太薄，營養不良，影響士氣甚大，據記者探悉最近國軍的待遇，每月所得的薪餉如次：</p>
<p>下等兵三〇〇元</p>
<p>中等兵三三八元</p>
<p>上等兵四五〇元</p>
<p>下士六〇〇元</p>
<p>中士七五〇元</p>
<p>上士一〇五〇元</p>
<p>准尉四五六〇元</p>
<p>少尉五一九〇元</p>
<p>中尉六一五〇元</p>
<p>上尉七八〇〇元</p>
<p>少校九六〇〇元</p>
<p>中校一二四五〇元</p>
<p>上校一四一〇〇元</p>
<p>少將一五六〇〇元</p>
<p>中將一七一〇〇元</p>
<p>上將一九〇〇〇元</p>
<p>以上面的薪餉表看來，下等兵每月三百元，現在只好買燒餅十五隻，上將一萬九千元，只够買一擔多米，這就是國軍的待遇！副食費（菜金）每人每月一二〇〇元，官兵一律，每人每天只合四十元，採辦士兵到菜塲採購時，因與市塲物價距離太遠，不能不强迫菜販照所謂「官價」購買，菜販損失太鉅，不免發生怨言，這也是造成軍民不能合作的一種原因，部隊中菜金不敷，或需添菜，另外要靠主食軍米來補助，照國防部的規定，每人每天的食米是二十五兩，大槪吃不完，將剩餘的米出售，略可貼補菜金。國防部對此亦甚爲關切，將予改善，頃聞正籌劃發放實物，不過實施時技術方面問題尚多。</p>

<h3>公用事業關元計價本市各界羣表不滿　各綫公共汽車電車乘客廖落營業清淡</h3>
<p>本市公用事業經當局核准以單位關元計價後，公用交通車輛，昨日開始實行，於車中張貼單位牌價，較原票價最高上漲達百分之一百五十强，該項牌價，將來隨時根據外匯價格自由更動，此實爲公用交通劃時代售票之奇跡，一般市民因票價改爲關元單位計算後，均不敢搭乘，致昨日全市各綫公共汽車及有無軌電車之乘客頓見寥落，業務大爲淸淡，本市各界對公用事業此次以關元單位計價辦法，羣表憤懣。又悉：公用交通公司出售之本市公共汽車及有無軌電車月季票價，公共汽車普通每月一萬元，公教人員五千元，電車每月八千元，公教人員四千元，係爲暫定性質，原擬半個月調整一次，未獲市政當局核准，三月份月季票售價，決定不再更動。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨日公共汽車及電車售票價，業已正式按照關元基數（單位）價折合金圓券計算，電車頭等分七十元，一百元，一百二十元，一百五十元，一百七十元，五種。三等分七十元，八十元，一百元，一百十元四種。公共汽車分八十元，一百十元，一百六十元，一百八十元，二百元，二百三十元六種。嗣後各項票價由於單位價格之波動，將隨時由公用局核算調整。</p>

<h3>廿年浮沉銀海出賣青春健康　嚴月傷心說往事吸毒上癮都爲拍戲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕老牌電影明星曾演過五十張影片的「黑玫瑰」嚴月閒出獄後，依其老父嚴工上與兄妹同居，白來靜極思動，有再度獻身銀幕之想。</p>
<p>記者昨天到她寓所去訪問，餒月開談起以往大有不堪回首之感。她因吸食鴉片而三度入獄，頗爲人所不齒，認爲她自甘墮落，但據她自述吸毒上癮的經過，却是另有一番傷心史，而且可反映出一般電影從業員的痛苦。</p>
<p>她說從十二歲開始拍電影，因爲常常通宵工作，寒暖無常，身體一天天的壞了。在「火燒紅蓮寺」一片中担任女俠的角色，爲要拍攝屋頂上飛行的鏡頭，她穿上笨重緊密的鋼絲馬甲，在高處跳躍奔跑，從此種下心臟衰弱之病根。又在「三個父親」一片中與王獻齋龔稼農合演，她担任翼妻的角色。劇中龔被槍決，她抱了孩子趕到，跪在雪地裏撫屍痛哭，一條腿因此凍壞了，常常酸痛。</p>
<p>當時電影從業員的生活大都很腐化，化粧室裏往往備有幾套煙具，演員吸食鴉片的極多，如王獻齋王次龍等後來都死於煙毒。她因心臟袞弱發展爲氣喘病，在別人的勸誘之下，開始以吸鴉片來治療，慢慢地就吸上癮了。</p>
<p>第一次入獄後，繼之以二次三次，她解釋說這都是因爲氣喘病復發而再吸的·直到現在她說心臟仍舊很衰弱，雖然鴉片是不再吸了。</p>
<p>嚴月閒現在的確已沒有了煙容。她今年三十二歲，雖然經過了三度牢獄生涯，神情依舊很樂觀愉快·她說很希望能與從前的老明星再來合演一片，但是經過十幾年的人事滄桑，這希望恐怕很不容易實現吧。</p>
<p>嚴月閒的父親嚴工上是電影界老前輩，曾拍過整整一百部影片，今年已七十六歲，從去年春天起，他患了半身不遂的癱病，家計賴他的兩個兒子維持，雖然還過得去，却很淸苦。記者替他攝影，他慨歎地說：「電影演員出賣的是靑春與健康，這一張照片恐怕是我的最後一張了」。</p>

<h3>箱屍案兇犯必不止一人　騐屍發現女子內褲警局今起參加偵查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕火車箱屍案，經路局警務人員二日來之努力，已陸續發現有價値之綫索甚多，承辦警探現正設法使各項綫索連貫，構成「假定事實」，然後再循此「假定」進行偵查。至於在崑山尋獲之可疑男子，僅悉曾經一度訊問，其他一切，鐵路當局均拒絕透露。</p>
<p>「箱屍」昨日下午二時由地檢處丁同峻檢察官往常德路騐屍所檢驗，騐得屍塊頭顱下連頸部處有繩索勒痕，頭骨粉碎，左眼上下有大小刀痕五處，由此可證死者在被害時，曾經與兇手發生激烈毆鬥，並知兇犯必非一人。箱中除昨日本報所載之軍毯，女大衣，報紙等物外，驗屍時又發現染有血跡之白色女子內褲一條·各項證物及皮箱於驗屍後，仍交兩路警務處帶回硏究·承辦便警今將携此兩裝盛屍塊之皮箱，赴滬杭路某站，使該站行李佚認看，因案發後，警務處曾分電滬杭綫各站，吿以裝屍塊之兩皮箱式樣，俾先查明「箱屍」之來處，據聞：某站一行李伕自稱曾於一日爲旅客提送此兩皮箱，若此點能够證實，則已向破案途徑跨進一大步矣。</p>
<p>市警察局對此案亦十分注意，昨日騐屍時曾派員前往參加工作，路局亦以該案最先發覺雖在火車上，而兇案發生地點及兇犯癮匿處，未必在車站或鐵路沿綫附近，路警職權則限於車站及兩路沿綫，故今日起路局將會同市警局進行偵查云。</p>

<p>乘吉普卡車向辛豐鎭急駛，費五十分鐘時間，卽到達省訓團軍幹班本部，這時起，耳鼓裏就灌上了乓乓乒乒的槍彈聲，呼吸着緊張的軍營氣息，經過了沙科長約介紹認識了該班的總隊長董繼陶，他是山東人，方面大耳，身材肥碩，充滿了一臉的和靄表情，互相寒喧以後；他就帶着總隊附周時豫，副總隊長宋敬銘，陪同記者往操塲上去參觀。</p>
<p>首先看他們學生第二大隊的</p>
<p>步兵連攻擊，展開內衝鋒陣內戰，眞槍實彈，轟砲，幾關槍連珠似的掃射，手溜彈的爆炸聲，演來逼真活像一幅作戰圖，使記者看了不禁油然而有投筆從戎之感，全部的演習有半個多鐘點，董總隊長還解釋說，像這樣的訓練，當我國的留日學生，做到衝鋒陣內戰最後一步動作的時候，日本的教官就不教我們中國人了，以致中日事變，我們就都吃着這個虧。</p>
<p>以後繼續參觀學校第二中隊第一二區隊，第一中隊第一區隊等內務，這些隊址，原來是些祠堂廟宇，稍加修飾後，卽</p>
<p>成爲軍事化了，他們睡的是地舖，白被單疊得非常整潔，各樣用物的陳設也井井有條，第五中隊第二三區隊等，完全是戰備內務，被單都裹成一個小捲，槍上也裝着刺刀，另外還有什麼室外沙盤，識字沙盤等的教育設置。</p>
<p>據周總隊附對記者說：現在本班</p>
<p>共兩千多人第一期學生班一千多人，是去年十二月開課的，三個月畢業，還有二十多天就要結束了，第二期學生班現在已經開始報到，有一千多人，學生的來源大都是各縣保安團及省保安團的班長調訓，及招考來的流亡學生，年齡都在二三十歲之間，軍官班已經畢業兩期，四星期畢業，第三期現已開始報到，他們的來源大都是各縣保安團及省保安團各縣警察局等的官佐及投効的軍官，學生現在編爲四大隊，一大隊四中隊，一中隊三區隊，一區隊三班，一班十三人，約有兩千人，軍官班編爲一大隊三中隊約有五百人。</p>
<p>整個軍幹班所佔的面積有四五華里，週圍有山有水，天然是個訓練陶冶身心的好地方，他們平常的生活都是：早晨六時起身，六時半升旗，早操，七時上野操，九時早餐，九時半上講堂，下午二時又上操，四時晚餐，生活非常緊張。</p>
<p>馬燕平敎官對記者說：因爲團隊的生活不合軍人標準，不合軍人要求，使人民見了痛恨，所以丁主席才設立軍幹班，着重生活訓練，要做成秋毫無犯，叫人民歡迎，才達到我們的目的，訓練方式分生活，紀律，技術，三種。我們的口號是：（一）戰教合一，講堂卽操塲，操塲卽戰塲，（二）學做一致，不講表面，不重形式，學了就做，養成吃苦耐勞的精神，（三）毋廢毋縱，苦幹實幹，例如修理公路，種植菜園，都是我們積極的表現，我們平時幷常常</p>
<p>舉行小組會談論的中心都是生活紀律，完全自由發揮，康樂活動方面，籃球，足球，排球，網球均有，每週還舉行一次晚會，有平劇，歌唱，滑稽，雜耍等，新鋒週刋，是本班的軍中文化，上面都刋載有關軍隊生活情况，軍人活動等文字，總而言之，我們是要做到軍民眞心合作，相親相愛。</p>
<p>經過三四小時的觀覽，收獲的材料這麼多，記者感到本滿意了，軍人假使都有這樣樸實的精神，誰說中國不會富强康樂，我衷誠的祈禱着-江蘇戰士們的搖籃－軍幹班－能够發揚光大。</p>

<h3>爲地方·爲人民·爲下一代　推動基本敎育示範區　蘇省敎廳長洪鈞培舉行講演</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員　朱向高</p>
<p>〔本報宜興一日訊〕現任江蘇教育廳廳長洪鈞培，赴錫視導社教事業及解決本縣省立農林科職校校長問題，於上月廿一日來縣，適値本縣縣參議會第一屆第七次大會揭幕，乃於是日假縣立中學大禮堂招待全體縣參議員，卽席發表演說「現社會下推行基本教育示範區之重要性」一文，一再提示議員本身職責，領導本縣教育人員堅守崗位，渡過當前艱苦難關，強調介率農村，增加生產，協助推動基本教育示範區之開展，促使本縣走上富強康樂之光明坦途，意深語重。記者忝列該會紀錄，茲將</p>
<p>講詞原文錄下，以供參考或借鑑：</p>
<p>關於基本教育，首先要說明的計兩點：（一）在座諸位，乃人民代表，民間疾苦，端賴諸位先生向政府轉達，以求謀改進，現在民間疾苦已達極點，政府爲要解決人民痛苦，則必須先得完全熟知民間眞實之情况，否則紙上談兵，徒然隔靴搔癢，這些便是諸位今日肩上之重大職責，議會乃政府與人民間之橋樑督促政府解除人民痛苦，實施善政，則議會當首先須謀與政府配合，方能發揮效用，不僅於議會本身須要團結，與政府實極須通誠合作發揮力量，則人民幸福將不期至而自至矣。</p>
<p>（二）時局動盪，人心極度不安，往往將促使社會不亂自亂，這種情形，乃爲過渡時期所難免，安危往往在一轉念間，鑄成大錯，故今日誠爲最艱險之時期，諸位平日在鄉實應曉諭民衆認淸時代，領導人民，力持鎮靜，各自堅守崗位，勿爲外來阻力所動搖，則社會秩序當可不安自安，一如風雨孤舟，未來命運刻已瀕於禍福之邊緣，僅倚同舟者，能同心合力，愈是鎭靜，則方能謀得解決辦法，安度難關，愈是環境趨勢險惡，愈須按照常軌做事，臨難鎭靜，我以爲欲安定社會秩序，固須鎭靜，尤貴在</p>
<p>領導得人這個提倡的責任，卽在地方上諸位議員先生及執行教育人員肩上，並非諱言，全國教育，江蘇第一，江蘇教育，宜興第一，本縣文化，教育，素以發達見稱，本有常軌可循，然際此非常時期，乃因種種人爲原因，不無發生脫離理想情事，務祈諸位全力協助，俾得納入正軌，易言之，現在社會之騷擾過去教育人員，實應負責，根本係對本身業務已純失責，若能將教育辦理成功，決不會再有混沌不安現象，我們現代盡責，卽爲替下一代布緒常軌，如今的教育成敗，不僅影響現社會，實種因於下一代也，故頗望諸位能協同教育人員勸諭民衆鎭靜，安定社會秩序，安渡當前難關</p>
<p>本人還要向諸（二）</p>
<p>請救兩點　（一）希望各位倡導人民增加農村生產，現社會之動盪不安，其最大原因在「貧」物資稀少社會不敷分配，欲增加物資，則非先增加生產不爲功，安定社會先決條件之一，如宜興耕地一項，卽有一百廿九餘萬畝，按每畝田能增加五十斤至百斤收穀，卽可增加生產六十萬担至百萬祖左右，其實每畝增加這些數目決非難事，再加增加副產品，財產乃安大增，民間卽大富裕，社會乃無故謀社會安定，增加生產實爲根本問題，亟待仰賴諸位加以倡導及鼓勵，該項事業方能順利進行。</p>
<p>（二）中國過去的教育，依了「學而優則仕」的說法，乃成了培養少數人的教育，並非爲生活而讀書，至此階段教育已失本來意義，完全變質矣，社會之進化遲緩，乃因人權不能平等，謀人權平等，實須從教育入手，知識平等，多數人才不被少數人支配操縱，少數人進步，決不能被稱爲社會的進步，基本教育，不僅使人識字是指導人類如何做人，如何生產如何生活，如何做一個現代公民之方法，易言之，卽指示人類如何求生存，將整個教育與做人道理與政治，與生產，與公民，與生活配合，如能將基本教育推行完成，乃已步入富强康樂之新環境矣，推動此項工作，固須謀充沛經費，際此縣財政倍覺竭蹶之時，當然不能再加重人民之負祖，非在該項工作之重要性上說，實決不能稱爲龐大，好在取之地方，亦用之地方。此外，本人並請求美援會農村復興委員會劃出</p>
<p>一部經濟移用於基本教育，實在亦卽充裕了地方財政，以後時局如不過份惡化，對該項方案之推動，中央與省方將均予補助，實施該項工作，須廣大人力，能對基本教育稍有經騐者，本人均將延攬，諸祈各位廣予推薦墾荒前途，備多艱困均盼諸位爲地方，爲人民，爲下一代，協力推動基本教育示範區，以底於成，實爲本人馨香祝禱着的一件工作。</p>
<h3>隴上春回</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州廿八日航訊〕大地春回，寗靜而乏生氣，不過，記者於兩週前去靑海訪問時，一個瑞雪初霽的晴朗天氣，登十世班禪所駐錫的昂　院，在院前的草坪上，發現一片生殖力極强的馬蘭草，已由雪對的泥土下，茁生起粗壯的幼芽，不禁怦然心動。待回程馳過遼闊的庫庫諾爾大草原時，從樹校，從草尖，都漾起一片嫩黃的色調，春神已悄悄地降臨西北了。</p>
<p>今天的蘭州，由於治中將軍的活躍，甘·寗·責·新·四省軍政首長的雲集會商，名符其實的成了西北的神經中樞。年靑的蘭州市長孫汝楠說，西北軍政首長在蘭坦聚首而像這次整齊的，還是空前第一遭。徧徧蘭州市自己不爭氣，不時停電，水的供應也不方便，言下十分抱歉。</p>
<p>團結安定進步生存</p>
<p>以張治中長官爲中心，大員們舉行過十幾個座談會和無數的私人交換意見，終於決定了西北最近未來的動向：「從團結中求安定，從安定中求進步」，「從進步中求生存。」爲和平宣勤數月的張治中將軍，曾偸閑幾天，獨居離蘭州五十多公里的興隆山，熟思整個大局，考慮西北決策，於是有一些人，對張氏不免抱過神經過敏的臆斷，但現在是被事實所轟毁了。張氏返蘭時一再强調：」謀取和平要理智，要冷靜，」眞的和戰未決，自己先亂哄哄地鬧成一團，　非自取滅亡？</p>
<p>回春之曲序曲譜成</p>
<p>儘管春寒如何料峭，時局如何變幻，西北各省的當局，已爲「回春之由」譜出了「序曲」，團結，團結，團結，融融洩洩，才能使安定西北的工作順利的展開。在安定這課題下，第一個答案便是挽救行將崩潰的西北經濟，在西北軍政畏官的主持下，經濟委員會於九日宣吿成立，接着聘遴許多專家學者，分財政·金融·土地·物價等小組，研究當前的各項嚴重問題，再作澈底加强及改善辦法。</p>
<p>物價上揚懷念橢橢</p>
<p>據市府最近的統計，蘭州物價上漲頗猛，公教人員每月所領的薪津，只値一兩個銀元不等，大家認爲歸根結蒂，都是金圓劵坑了人，不禁　念起　　（西北人對銀幣的　稱）來·早在半年之前，甘省府會都再三向中樞要求過恢復甘肅造幣廠的事，朱經獲准，自各省醞　發行地方貨幣後，甘省府又舊事重提，終蒙中樞核准，預備恢復銀幣的鑄造·當局派人檢查前造幣廠的機件，主要的工具軋花機不見了，省府目前是否決定恢復鼓鑄，當在機器的本身能力上加以深長的考慮。</p>
<p>西北地區經濟單元</p>
<p>在改革西北經濟具體方案還未產生公佈之前，政府爲穩定幣値，消弭漲風，將有幾項應急措置卽付實施。據記者獲悉的，有禁止銀幣出境，黃金白銀及銀幣出入價格，均由央行每日掛牌爲準。至於解決整個西北經濟問題的方案，據說對於西北的金融體系，財政收支，通貨運用諸方面，以組成西北區經濟單元爲重心，都有一個整套的計劃，不僅可以安定民生，而且還可抉助生產。</p>
<h3>常州劫獄巨案　要犯費國祥等被緝拿</h3>
<p>〔本報武進二日訊〕常州刧獄巨案發生後，所長黃維翰，看守主任郭履福，看守王慶廻·曹繼京·吳恩澤五名，經城防部拘送警局先行偵訊一過，發覺嫌疑之點甚多，內情曲折處，一時未便發表。警局已將各人口供，送城防部核示，一面令屬加緊緝拿劫獄及被劫人犯計：費國祥，廿五歲，浙吳興人，作吳江盛澤鎭鮑家弄當房，四方臉，皮色白淨。倪德芳，武進湖塘橋人，曾犯盜案。黃明，廿八歲，金壇二區添閱人，小圓臉。吳健，卅歲，丹陽四區西濮鄕人，小尖臉。孫小海，廿五歲，丹陽李莊橋人。葉才堂，卅二歲，束橫林崔橋人，烟毒犯。勒芳，卅六歲，廣東人。犯漢奸罪。陳品章，廿二歲，烟毒犯。曹理青，四十三歲，無錫仲仁路同益里一號，會汚犯判三年六月，近視眼。又曹理青曾監撰請保釋狀一通，於出事後一天，着人送呈地院，該院收發馮某竟照例收下，嗣經張院長面加申斥。關於曹現青又有一插曲，渠與蔣世孝均犯稅捐舞弊貪汚案。現蔣世孝尙在　押中，曾於出　連名投稿向吳縣蘇報民衆呼聲欄公開呼籲，原文略謂金潮案主角楊安仁，兩路局舞弊主角張鴻圖等大貪汚官巳獲自由，小食汚官仍在樊籠，請當局援例，准予保釋，讀者咸感啼笑皆非。</p>
<h3>明港印象</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　房滄浪</p>
<p>記者團一談，乃決定下車訪候。不意車停後，月台上鞭砲之聲，劈劈拍拍，巳響個不停。在各界排隊相迎的行列中，且多鬚髮俱白之長者，鎭上七一高齡之李潔鄉老先生，亦肅立在行列之中，含笑爲禮。如此塲面，如此景象，諸同業當之，莫不感愧莫名。但以盛情難却，不能繞過月台而逃，只好以抱拳，打拱，作揖，舉手，各種方式一邊行，一邊答禮，一溜烟跑過，那知進得明港寨後，街上爆竹聲又是此起彼落，響遍全寨。到了某軍師部，會見當地父老，我們逐一請教，連聲道謝道歉而後，記者與諸同業不禁相顧赧然一笑。</p>
<p>我們與當地父老，在師部同進晚餐，飯後，舉行座談會，聰到若干軍民合作的動人故事，並且傾聽了諸父老若干寳賣意見，他們從明港以東，天目山的土共活動情形，談到桐柏山土共在鐵路</p>
<p>〔本報信陽廿六日航訊〕駐馬店防務之重要，有如上述，記者團爲了减少駐軍對於招待保護我們的辛勞。當天下午三時半，吿別各界，仍乘原車，返回信陽·四時五十分，車過明港，因午前已接軍方電話，得知明港父老渴欲與西邊，給予這地方的威脅，但很信賴李本一軍長安定信賜四周的軍事威力，對於李軍×師的軍風紀，更是贊不絕口。明港屬信陽，距城廂約有九十華里，東距正陽約有八十五華里，全鎭居民約有二萬餘，出產以糧食·猪隻·豆油·高粱酒·牛羊皮爲大宗。民風很淳樸，在農曆春節後一日，該鎭第五保馬樓等地，因爲應付不了由北南下的泌陽地方團隊，軍民由誤會發生衝突。被燒燬了十餘個村莊，死亡鄉民卅餘人。</p>
<p>事後，據官方說，這些沒穿沒吃的團隊，也委實可憐又可怕。現在已着手整頓了，可是明港被害的鄉民，已死而不可復生‘我們希望當局趕快將這些不良團隊，予以淘汰，別再害人。我們一行，離開明港時，每個人都懷着一腔惶愧的心情，吿別鎭上父老和各界，當晚九時回到了信陽。</p>
<h3>西南交通大動脈　成渝鐵路工程復活</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　周學端</p>
<p>〔本報成都廿六日航訊〕烽火連天，强顏渡歲，在春節忍受物價苦難的兩川人民，最近意外地聰到與奮消息：西南交通大動脈的成渝鐵路，經中樞明令復甦工程，經費列入國家總預算，並趕修渝內段輕軌工程，限年內通車。這作爲四川交通基幹的唯一鐵路，擾鑲近四十年，波潾起伏，時輟時修，到今天樂觀厥成，美景在望，實在使烽火十年的四川老百姓，感到無限溫暖與慰安。</p>
<p>全部工程多災多難</p>
<p>一部成渝鐵路工程史，正代表四十年四川興繁衰弊的滄桑變化，鼎革以前，路議初創，不期年集款二千七百餘萬圓；比及國有議起，四川人爲了保護交通主權，灑血拋顱，奮身保路，促成了辛亥革命。民國以還，軍閥爭權，大小內戰三百八十餘次，路款盡被瓜分，工程整個停頓。廿七年，川局粗定，中樞始建興條計劃，並與法銀團訂立合同，組川黔鐵路公司主持。興工不久，抗戰發生，器材無法內運，工程又形頓挫，勝利復員，國府爲酬謝四川對抗戰殊勳，交部復訂兩年完成全路計劃，但又以國庫匱乏，路款不濟，興修工程，若斷若續。這條天府之國交通心臟的唯一鐵路，從創議到興修，亘四十年，眞可謂波折頓挫，多災多難。此一次中樞對成渝路工程，提前實施三年通車計劃，當不啻爲西南交通劃一新紀元。</p>
<p>提前興築限期通車</p>
<p>根據政院撥款提前興築計到，已經院務會議通過四點：（一）卅七年下年度墊撥工款一千零六十萬金圓已撥。（二）運雜費三千萬金圓照撥。（三）本年每月工程費二千萬金圓，先撥三個月。（四）第一年計劃所需外匯四百萬美元，由中央銀行至少先撥一百萬美元。又據交通部計劃，以成渝路作爲構通西北及西南鐵路大幹綫，目前工程進展，由重慶至內江段二百八十三公里路基，巳大部完成，距鋪軌狀態已無幾，爲適應早日通車，特儘先利用重慶各鋼鐵廠可能自製之輕軌及川省可能供給之材料，於渝內段暫時先用輕軌通車。同時積極籌購國外材料，俟運到後，陸續更換，而以拆下輕便軌料，逐步前移，最後作爲鋪設全綫支路之用。在此輕便鐵路通車初期，每日運輸量，可達八百噸，對目前川省交通運輸困難，解除不少問題，這無異是久困戰亂的四川人民和平建設福音。</p>
<p>渝內輕軌一年計劃</p>
<p>開始施工的渝內段輕軌一年通車計劃，計：（一）暫行改鋪輕軌路綫，目重慶至內江長二百八十三公里。（二）路綫標準，全綫路基橋涵燧道等建築，仍按國有鐵路寬　標準興築。鋼軌先用三〇磅輕軌鋪設通車，俟外洋重軌運到，卽行更換，而以卸下輕軌鋪設支綫。（三）需要機車車輛機器等件，僅量由各路調撥輕便機車及自造客車，特需鋼料，國內不能供給者，儘先向國外購運。（四）工料款估計，按一月份單價預算，共需一億九千六百萬金圓，包括：1完成渝內段未完工程，2鋪軌架橋及自造客貨車，3枕木五十萬根，4卅磅輕軌一萬噸，5鋼橋樑八百噸，6滬渝貨運三百噸等。這一計劃實行，一年內四川第一條正式鐵路，固然通車可卜，全川人民四十年來的美夢，也可實現了。</p>
<p>配合工程經建動態</p>
<p>配合一年通車，川省府同時計劃展開經濟建設，沿成渝路全綫，正從事發動地方資力，趕修支綫或公路以與幹道銜接。支綫部份，如成樂·成彭·井（自責）內（江）等綫，已分別由地方人士籌組公司，募集款項，進行工程。公路部份，如資（中）威（遠）·內（江）安（岳）等綫，工程並已開始實施·準備一年內使川省特產，如資中內江的糖，自貢的鹽，威遠的煤，藉這一條交通大動脈運輸通暢。而根據全綫完成後的運輸計劃，每年估計運輸貨品一百五十萬噸，包括米·煤各五十萬噸，鹽·糖·桐油猪鬃藥材·五金布疋百貨，其他雜貨各十萬噸，省府也擬訂配合運輸需要的發展特產計劃，作爲川今年建設計劃中心·成渝鐵路工程，今年展開新的復甦，這不特是川省交通好消息，對整個四川經濟建設，可以說也成了推動的原動力。</p>
<h3>蘇省全民組訓達五百餘萬人</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江二日訊〕據蘇省保安司令部發表，各縣民衆組訓工作巳經普及全民，該項工作係參照行政院頒佈之組訓規程，按照蘇省之實况另訂「江蘇省加强民衆組訓實施綱要』一種，經省府一九八次會議通過，頒發各縣實施。將保以下之全民，均納入組織，編爲保莊隊，少年隊，兒童隊，敬老會，婦女會等，予以訓練運用，期達自衛與自治境地。爲健全基層幹部加强領導，最近省府決定保長保隊長改爲有給職，一律照委任十六級支薪。據各縣報吿：進行組訓中之民衆，已達五百餘萬人。</p>
<h3>懷抱着嚴肅複雜心情面包黔政改革　切實推行不難自求多福</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔本報貴陽廿五日航訊〕貴州由於政治上自來是秉承中央，經濟上自來是依賴鄰省，造成她在生理上與心理上的種種痺弱，這在國家承平時代當無所謂，際此狼烟烽火逐漸燃燒到眉梢心頭的時候，她再痺弱也不能不强自撑持，設法自力更生，以度過這艱難困苦的歲月。</p>
<p>黔省政府於客歲十二月，擬訂調整縣各級機構調整方案，不特本省各縣行之已見績效，鄰省如川·湘·桂等省亦紛紛函請檢寄該項方案作爲改革基層政治之藍本，足見行政機構，並非一成不變，時勢演進，必須力求因應得宜。本省政費開支，百分之九十五均仰賴中央補助，目前國庫支絀，倍於往昔，京穗貴陽間交通運輸，均較鄰省任何省會艱難，全面和平固爲人人所渴望，萬一戰爭繼續，一切發生變化，以遠處邊地而又十分貧困之貴州，似不能不早爲準備。谷正倫主席基於此種需要，特飭各主管部門草擬「貴州省政治改革方案，」，經時月餘，幾番修正，乃於今（廿五）日省府常會正式通過，並卽飭切實施行。這方案，在</p>
<p>制度方面要將專員縣長職權酌爲提高，駐區縣的省屬機關學校，授權專員代表省府監督考核，各縣田糧處長，稅捐稽征處長，警察局長，民衛隊副總隊長得由縣長遴保，縣府各科室主管人員如有重大過失，無論其爲省派抑係縣長遴保任用者，均准由縣長先行停職並遴員代理。爲儲備縣長人選，並規定現任縣府佐治人員著有成績者，得爲縣長任用標準之一。縣長曁各科室主管人員准予支給特別辦公費，縣長比照省府委員，各科室主管人員比照省府科長，並隨同省級人員調整，不得另支養廉金或養廉穀，以省地方財力。</p>
<p>法令方面力求簡化易行，規定一切法令宜帶彈性，如與各該縣實情不合，准由縣擬具變通辦法呈奉核准實施，中央法令倘已失時效或與本省實情不合，必須呈請廢止或修正，本省單行法規須切實檢討分別廢止歸併，以期簡明，爲加强</p>
<p>應變措施屬於省級機構者，力行合署辦公原則，凡關於總務·會計·統計·人事·視察。督導等事宜，決統一辦理，以節開支而增效率。其屬於縣級機構者，當照本省前頒縣各級機構調整方案，不許遽予變更。配合此項機構調整，關於</p>
<p>人事方面之決定，省級部份在合署辦公後，省府總員額（學校除外）以保留三分之二爲原則，其餘派遺區縣工作，以免人才上浮，派往區縣工作人員一律保留原薪原級，但被派人員如不願前往者卽以辭職論·縣級部份之縣府職員須嚴格甄別，凡不稱職者均予停職，遺缺卽以省級派遣人員繼任，鄕鎭長暫行停止民選，由縣長遴選合格人員充任，鄕鎭主任幹事及保幹事迅卽開始訓練，由縣長切實掌握運用。財政爲</p>
<p>庶政之母關於省級財政方面有如下規定，爲達安富濟貧目的。自衛特捐應從重課征，商業及投機事業之過份利得，必要時得以富戶爲對象，舉辦救濟特捐。爲使負担公平，將以淸田均賦爲本年度主要中心工作之一。關係縣級財政方面着重切實整理現有各項稅收，嚴禁地方公教人員及參議員承投襟征稅款，提高滯納處罰標準並試辦鄉鎭代征稅款。嚴格執行從價征稅，隨時調整以增加稅收，必要時一律以實物爲征收對象。各縣積穀貸放，得另加息穀一成以作保管開支。鄕鎮造產如用攤派形式必須嚴加制止·至各縣輔幣缺乏，應速向央行交涉運濟，如有自行製發雜色輔幣或代用券者，應於央行輔幣運到時卽嚴禁流通使用。黔省本年度</p>
<p>中心工作之首要爲治安第一，各縣縣長以辦理民衛組調成績爲攷核去留之依據，民衛隊副總隊長以避免本籍爲原則，總隊附一律裁撤，改設督練員，分赴各鄉鎭督辦訓練，訓練以採機動訓練爲原則，已經實施組訓之人民，宜給予經濟上之協助如計口授鹽，優先農貸，配給美菸種子等。裝備以「有額必有人，有人必有槍，有槍必有彈」爲理想，隊丁主副食餉，須合併爲士兵伙餉，一律發給稻穀，其數量最低以足够一兵必需伙食爲準。</p>
<p>貴州經濟建設方針，採農業工業並重，農業先求增加地面生產，工業先求發展陸上交通，故本年努力重點，仍爲「交通第一」，「生產第一」，爲求抵補鹽布漏巵，今後將繼續倡導推廣美菸，油菜，桐油及木油，惟應加强技術指導，以免徒勞無功，公有荒山，決獎勵人民植樹造林，長成樹後，歸人民所有，公地亦隨之歸其所有，以示獎勵，並嚴禁放火燒山，藉以保護林木。關於修築縣道，應由建設廳統一設計及技術指導，各縣不得各自爲政，以免重蹈過去徒耗人力物力，不切實際之覆轍。</p>
<p>他如禁政之嚴格執行，衛生之力求普及，社會風氣之銳意革新，均有詳細論列，總以辦到一切公教人員</p>
<p>厲行廉能兩字爲要求準繩，「廉」以官不貪，吏不擾，軍警不作咸作福爲最低限度，「能」以打破「不求有坊但求無過」之消極心理爲先決條件。</p>

<h3>贛省土地改革推行實施方案</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌廿六日航訊〕耕者有其田，是國民黨實施民生主義的一貫政策，亦是今年江西省政府的施政中心工作之一。方天逸主席到任伊始，就宣佈重視土地改革問題，並且希望用快速的方法，以求實效。</p>
<p>現在省府參照廣西·浙江推行土地改革的成例，擬訂「江西省土地改革實施方案」，卽將公佈實施。此一方案的內容，據省府新聞處長劉家樹談，計分四點：</p>
<p>（一）限制私有耕地：卽規定每戶十口之家的私有耕地，不得超過上等水田五十畝，或中等七十畝，或下等一百畝，旱地比照加倍，其超過此限額的耕地，概限於六個月內出賣，逾期不賣者，由縣（市）政府征收，配售給原佃農或自耕農。出賣的地價，照原租額的七成，自卅九年起分十四年以實物交付·荒地無主耕地，或超額耕地，除由原耕作農民承買者外，應由現役軍人家屬優先承買，這就是耕者有其田，和戰士授田兩大政策的中心，政府直接配售於自耕農的土地，其地價按原租額之五倍，分十年償付。其他關於耕地等級的標準，和租額等，在方案內亦有詳細規定。</p>
<p>（一）扶植自耕農：（一）征收放領私有耕地，　禁止非自耕農承買耕地，（三）辦理自耕農貸款，（四）創設自耕農塲。</p>
<p>（三　)保障佃農：（一）登記租約，（二）限制地租，（三）保障佃權，業主取回自耕時，應於一年前通知佃農，佃農自請退耕時，應於三個月前通知業主。</p>
<p>（四）健全農民組織：（一）各級農會應於兩個月內，完成組織，協助辦理土改。（二）絕對禁止自耕農參加農會爲會員，以防止土豪劣紳的混入，倘違犯此項規定，則該管指導的政府負責人，應受嚴重處分。</p>
<p>省府擬訂的土改方案，不僅是計劃，而且訂有實施和完成的限期。依據規定，將舉辦：（二）耕地總歸戶，或總調查，自卅八年四月開始，十月完成超額耕地，限於卅九年一月以前出賣。（二）耕地征收及扶植自耕農等項工作，自卅九年三月開始，同年十二月完成。（三）契約登記，限卅九年二月以前辦竣。（四）自耕農塲，示範期限，於兩年內辦竣。</p>
<p>江西的「土改方案」，方主席是下有最大的決心，予以澈底施行，並且準備以對敵作戰的精神，對推行此一新政過程上發生的土劣橫覇等方面的阻碍，決予淸除，來完成歷史上，經濟上劃時代的重大改革。</p>

<h3>籌設金銀公開市塲　國行仍在研究中　一說將採用官督民營方式</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外界疊傳國行當局，爲配合財金改革方案，正在籌劃開闢金銀市塲，俾國行能經由正當途徑，隨時察酌市塲情形，拋售金銀，以達穩定金融市塲之目的。惟根據種種（二）象以觀，國行當局對此一計劃，目前仍在硏究策劃之階段。至謂組織一專門委員會之機構，專司拋售金銀之事，顯然尙未成熟。國行當局對此事亦保持緘默。惟就該行劉總裁迭邀金業領袖徐輔蓀及銀樓公會理事長吳彭年兩氏洽談之事觀之，顯見當局對此事確在積極推進中。</p>
<p>又據徐輔蓀吳彭年兩氏表示，此次受金融當局邀談，純係備當局諮詢而巳，渠等對當局籌劃開放金銀市塲之事，毫無成見，蓋決策純由政府擬劃，當局僅對金業及銀樓兩業所屬會員家數，經營方式，買賣習慣，及貨物成色標準等等，有所詢問而已。此外，並未請渠等對未來之金銀市塲，供獻任何意見。</p>
<p>（又訊）財金新方案公佈後，金銀已恢復自由買賣，當局爲使金銀交易入於正軌起見，促成金銀業商人籌設金銀公開市塲。國行總裁劉攻芸連日迭召前金業公會及銀樓業公會負責人談話，商洽金銀公開市塲籌設步驟。新市塲將在官督民營方式下，從事交易。管制辦法正由財政部草擬中，卽可公佈。新市塲預計本月中旬前可望成立。</p>
<p>按金銀公開市塲，停頓已歷數年，此次當局突決定籌劃恢復，各方均頗注意。衆信當局之目的似在疏導游資，减少物價方面之壓力云。</p>
<h3>收兌收幣技術當局考慮改善　或將變爲外幣存款</h3>
<p>存單准許自由買賣</p>
<p>關於外幣收兌工作，自中央銀行根據財金改革方案於日前開始掛牌收兌後，因掛牌價格與實際不無距離，致使收兌工作無法順利展開。記者頃目財政當局獲悉，是項收兌辦法，當局巳在考慮作技術上之改善。惟收兌原則，則不予變更。另據中央銀行方面透露，是項技術上之變更，可能係將目前之現金收兌，改變爲外幣存款性質。持有人將外幣交與中央銀行後，由該行付給類似外匯移轉證之存單。是項存單，並將准許其自由買賣，並抵充進口外匯之用云。</p>
<h3>貿易協會請收購梧商外匯移轉證</h3>
<p>據悉梧州雖經行政院會議通過爲對外貿易口岸，但當地國行對梧出口商所持外匯移轉證尙拒不收購。廣州國行亦祇限於收購廣州所發移轉證，致梧州出口商所持之移轉證無處可售。在資金調度上，深感窒息之苦。此間國際貿易協會據報前情，已予轉請國行飭知梧分行收購移轉證，幷電知滬穗行代收。同時對於梧證在滬售出時所得金額，准予免費匯梧云。</p>
<h3>各地行莊增資現金財部指示繳存手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於各地行莊，已將增資現金繳存者，財政部頃通知國行，可先照規定手續，派員查驗報部，茲錄財部電文如次：「查各地行莊，凡巳依照規定，將增資現金繳存者，應卽由當地貴行或委託驗資之銀行，先照規定手續，派員前往各該行莊查帳核對，其傳票及收股存根，經驗明增資現金及估價增値之資產屬實，飭依照規定格式，出具切結後，卽給予驗資證明書，並將各該行莊所送調整資本報吿表，由負責人簽章通同切結及資負表，一併報轉本部核辦，以資迅捷，又信託公司爲銀行之一種，凡經呈准本部設立之信託公司，均應依照規定，調整資本，將增資現金繳存。」</p>
<h3>國家行局差出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨有六五三三四萬頭寸差出，洋商銀行差八七五六三萬元，大交換各行亦差入二五七三〇萬元，小交換各行則差出三六〇三二萬元。</p>
<h3>金管局決從嚴取締　商貨以銀元標價　銀元雖許流通並非無限法償</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自財金改革方案公布後，據悉：本市有少數商店，竟以銀元標價，出售貨品，頃滬金管局負責人語記者，政府准許銀元流通，原爲安定金融，便利人民之措施，並非以銀元代替金圓券作爲通貨之謂·易言之，金圓券仍爲無限法償之本位幣，銀元雖得自由流通，但債權人或債務人均不能强迫對方以之爲收付工具·故一切交易行爲，仍以金圓券爲法定收付工具。商號以銀元標價，不僅有强迫顧客以銀元爲收付之嫌，且足妨碍幣制，擾亂金融，應予從嚴取締云。</p>
<h3>物價波動期間走私無利可圖</h3>
<p>海關走私案件减少甚多</p>
<p>據江海關消息，近來本市走私案件較前减少甚多，數量亦較前减少。因在物價波動甚大之時，走私者無利可圖，遂紛紛停止活動。現海關抄獲者均爲少數由港來滬之單帮客，於行率中夾帶少數之玻璃絲襪口紅等奢侈品，無大宗之走私品云。</p>
<h3>已付貨款許可證　發出一五七四張</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會息：上月十九日至廿六日一週中所發放已付貨款之許可證進口貨値，共達美金六五八，八五一一·八四元。商品種類共計廿二種，許可證共發出一三二張。各貨進口値，以羊毛條所佔最鉅，計美金一四九，二四〇·五六元。次爲捲菸紙，計九七，七九五·三一元。三爲機器及另件，計七三，六九六·八四元。藥品及醫藥用具佔四，計七三，三二一·一二元。而佔發給許可證張數最多者爲染料，計共卅張。</p>
<p>又據統計，自去年十一月一日，至本年二月廿六日之十七個星期中，該會所發已付貨款之輸入許可證共達一五七四張，進口貨値共達美金一一，四二八，一四三·一八元。</p>
<h3>上月份關稅收入　總額達十億金圓</h3>
<p>目前尙未按關元征稅</p>
<p>據江海關稅務司張勇年談稱近夾海關關稅收入，日有增加。上（二）月份之關償稅收入總額爲十億金圓，較之一月份上漲達四億元。其稅收增加之原因，爲（一）外匯移轉證時有提高，（二）近來進出口貿易略有增加之故云。</p>
<p>又據張氏表示，財金改革方案中，規定海關此後征收關稅，槪以關元計算事，海關方面尙未接獲財部命令實施。迄目前止，海關仍按照舊辦法征收關稅云。</p>
<h3>茶市成交不多</h3>
<p>茶市連綿飛晋以來，昨市並不小休，變本加厲。良以紅綠茶，到存兩稀，同時自金融性各物，與圈外商品，以及公用事業等，一致狂騰後，影響成本至鉅，因此亦爲激起漲風之主要因素。以迄收市，各檔行情步履秀跡，而查交易，吐納談判雖熾，惟雙方喊價，形成倒懸，咸僅少數成就</p>
<h3>華股市勢轉疲台糖再見新價</h3>
<p>昨日華股全面止漲轉跌，市勢先堅後疲，一路下瀉，良以前漲過暴，銀根仍緊，大戶多頭反空，止進轉退所致。永紗初開高盤四元三角，開盤後行情始終在二角左右盤旋。十一時許一度曾高至四元二角五分，行情似有振作之勢，至十一時十五分，風聞央行大拋結匯證，人心又軟，市勢再見下落。最低曾降入四元關內，做三元九角三分。近收盤時，業外黃金喊好，行情被抬高至四元收盤。美亞走向下坡，開盤一元八角五分，最高一元八角七分，最低一元六角八分，收盤爲一元七角一分。合糖再見新價格，做二萬八千五百二十元，第十度掛紅。小型股漲停者，僅新亞藥廠一元二角四分，振華油漆一元七角四分，恒豐紗廠一元〇三分，華新水泥三角等四種。</p>
<h3>外股仍俏</h3>
<p>外股市勢仍趨堅穩，圈內銀根不如外間之緊，僅做六角左右，故昨日行情仍屬高俏。惟交易淸淡，會德豐銀行帮納胃甚健，高做二萬三千元，較上日軋升一千元。英聯做七千七百元，八千元，亦較上日稍爲高價。鋼業公司漲浪稍低，較上日升起僅五十元左右。其他各股差參，榮辱互見。</p>
<h3>黃金公債今晨上市</h3>
<p>黃金短期公債，今日開始上市買賣。證券交易所已出示公吿，定今晨開拍。每日上午九時半至十二時半，下午二時至三時爲開拍期間。星期六下午停市，交易期限分現貨及一日期貨二種，成交單位暫定爲票面黃金一兩。叫價單價以黃金一兩合金圓券之數叫價。價格升降單位暫定爲五十元，漲跌限度暫定爲百分之十。交割準備金一日期交易，徵收準備金百分之四十。概以現金繳納。</p>
<h3>港匯再縮</h3>
<p>〔商品調查所三日香港專電〕港申電匯今日晨開每千元一元三角，昨日晚收一元四角二分，金圓券每千元晨開二元六角，昨收同價。港金（每港兩）晨開三〇四元七角五，昨收三〇五元五角，美金電匯晨開五元一角，昨收五元一角九分。美金期票晨開五元一角七，昨收五元一角六分，美鈔晨開五元一角五，昨收同價。</p>
<h3>桐油邁進</h3>
<p>桐油昨市，一因漢口各路仍無到貨，一因業外物品漲勢猖獗，業中銀根鬆弛，故人心亢奮，持者向天喊價，是以昂風汹湧，頗難遏止，收市結果，一致軋升五千至萬元不等，交易頗多。</p>
<h3>基降煤價調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕台秈再度調整後，四礦聯營處之基隆煤昨亦隨以調整，新價爲六二二五〇元。外煤仍屬無貨無市，白煤塊及納子等價不動。</p>
<h3>台糖激升</h3>
<p>食糖昨市客帮買氣極旺，業內銀根略見寬鬆，開盤後聞食米激漲，人心向昂，買風甚盛。</p>
<p>45號車白精晨開以三七九〇〇元高盤喊做，故上趨勢猶挺，高見三八二〇〇元·嗣後多頭逢高吐售，圈外金鈔紗布高後猛回，銀根微見俏勢，市勢轉虛，午收時漲勢頓挫，回降一一〇〇元，以三七二〇〇元收市，升六〇〇〇元·粗砂市勢獨俏升七八〇〇元，其餘與白赤綿赤海赤提靑等，各檔一致普升二成至二成半。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕台糖公司昨開售第五十三期食糖，計一四〇斤裝大埔紅糖一種，價每担一四五〇〇元，共配出二千餘包。</p>
<h3>台糖市塲日狹</h3>
<p>華北銷路業巳受影響</p>
<p>〔合衆社台北三日電〕每年外銷食糖五十萬噸的台糖公司，現正面臨覓取市塲的問題。由於中共的佔領華北，台糖的外銷去路受了影響。中國全年的食糖消費，估計約爲八十萬噸，其中約及一半之數量，係由四川·福建·及廣東等省份所供給，其餘則仰給於台灣。在國外，日本爲台糖的主要輸入國之一，在本年度台糖之出口中，已有五分之一係運往日本。此外，朝鮮亦爲台糖市塲之一，惟容納不多，而香港。星加坡及暹羅等地，則無台糖的顧客。</p>
<h3>絲綢盤旋</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况晋入盤檔，初因圈外黃金高盤開做，人心尙堅，繼因銀根先鬆後緊，暗息不低，多頭負息過重，了售甚濃。</p>
<p>一二〇天橋先做九五萬元，開後略見盤升，市勢尙穩，嗣聞棉紗高後轉回，黃金走勢尤軟，人心頗淡，檯面觀此，行情轉盤，十一時後成交多爲隔日頭寸，一天利息關係，價格明升暗降，瀕午以九九萬元收市，午後聞業外各物均無好面，市况續軟，天橋喊九六萬，續小三萬元、</p>
<p>生絲昨市初因移轉證走勢鋒猛，喊價上挺，洋商頗有納意，人心看價，嗣後移轉證被壓回瀉，黃金市况又軟，趨勢止漲轉盤。優級初喊一二〇萬，其時外匯適跌，黃金報小，執戶不肯再扳，一度回小四萬元，小後本街帮徵納，市勢站穩，（二）升於一一八萬，最後移轉證低後回升，市勢總揚，午收市以一二三萬了結。午後市况無甚波動，喊小一二萬元。</p>
<p>綢緞昨市初開時人心頗堅，美亞初喊六六萬，中間微步盤升，高見六八萬元，嗣後圈外價均先高後回，市勢轉軟，終以六五萬收市。</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>看台客　拋移轉證能抽銀根就難能撳住市氣</p>
<p>近來財金方面種種措施，除開貨物稅徵實一事，其他都充分迎合市塲心理。譬如開放金銀交易，開放自備外匯，金公債上市並可以做一天期的現期套做等等，假使銀元計算軍餉的制度，也准人民採行。外幣買賣，也准人民自由，我想一定更獲好評。</p>
<p>經過十多年投機生活的上海市塲，歷來當局唯覺管不好，却也放不得。所以管管放放，弄成過去那付局面。現在步步開，處處放，情形也還不很壞，這不是奇蹟嗎？非也！個中自有原委，請聰分解。</p>
<p>過去走着逆水行舟的路，行政效率落後，當然一籌莫展。現在以爲迎合市塲投機心理，而以央行力量，決成敗在市塲鬥爭，則以集中的攻擊，對付散兵綫，收效一時，自是可能。蓋在當局眼中，認歷來市塲動盪，均非大局關係，而係市塲投機毒氣，而今卽取以毒攻毒方法來對付。</p>
<p>然則以毒攻毒，則當局用何種毒質爲兵器呢？一言以蔽之，目前爲止，只有一種，卽結匯證的拋賣和扒吸。金債券上市開拍後，又可能多一武器。</p>
<p>就第一種武器分析，我深覺不久卽將失效。</p>
<p>拋收外匯證，乃係利用市塲供辯法則，用以操縱美鈔市價，間接操縱黃金市價。金鈔二價，素爲一切物價變動的神經中樞。外匯移轉證，非實貨，取得移轉證，還有進口許可證揑在手裏。所以金鈔狂漲時，央行可無限制推川，把漲風壓住。如拋出量超過已發許可證時，卽暗中收回移轉證。等市塲再起反動時，卽可停吸或再吐。</p>
<p>這個手法的關鍵，就在以有限的進口許可證，而要無限制拋售轉移證，故勢非立卽收回溢拋之數不可。所以市塲中人，現巳知應付方法，卽：（一）當拋售移轉證時，大家並不套出金鈔，如有實力，反而乘低吐進，或去拉抬證劵和商品。（二）一待明拋停止，卽可捲土來歸。央行暗吸，正好助成其利。</p>
<p>這種拋吸外匯證，同時也發生抽銀根的副作用。其實二者互爲矛盾。假使拋售外匯證而能把銀根抽緊的，必有人拖進移轉證，則市價不能有力壓小。如猛拋而無人吸收，則銀根也就抽不過來。所以今日大家把二事併爲一談，認爲拋外匯證及抽銀根，所以市價看小，其實是不通的。</p>
<h3>圈外暴漲人心堅俏　食米價狂跳出兩萬元關</h3>
<p>米市昨展開猛烈漲風，因銀根寬鬆，圈外物價均漲，人心緊俏異常，早市猛漲最鉅，粳薄稻均曾出過二萬元外，中市漸見回疲，收市復堅。南市塲白粳一萬九千五百元，漲三千元。北市塲各米亦漲二千六七百元，特高粳高達二萬〇六百元，二市塲登記到貨六千一百五十七石。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市商會昨函直接稅局，請准許將卅七年下期營利事業所得展期申報，並將包繳實施辦法，迅予核復。原函云：敝會前准貴局公函，以三十七年度下半年營利事業所得，自卽日起，至二月二十八日止，爲申報期間。函請將飭各商一律遵辦，經函知各業遵令查報去後。茲據各業來會聲稱，自營利事業資本額折算金圓變更登記辦法頒布以後，未幾卽因金圓貶値，工商部又另擬變更登記補充辦法，以便實施。但守候至今，上述補充辦法，迄未奉公布頒發，以致工商業之資本計算，及財產伸算折舊，均屬無法依據辦理，決算旣因此待遲，所得自亦未能申報。應請轉商稅局，顧全現實，予以展期等語。核其情形，所稱未能依限申請之原因，旣不在於工商業方面，自屬無從設法趕辦，應請貴局一面據情轉呈，一面通知各稽征所，暫勿催報。又查二月廿三日行政院會議通過財政金融改革方案，有「直接稅中之營利事業所得稅，儘量採取同業分攤包繳辦法，就各地各業營業情况，估定稅額，實成各業公會限期催收繳納，以資簡捷」等語·其實施辦法，究屬如何，事關工商業切身利害，應請貴局轉呈財政部，迅予核定頒布，以便工商業事前研究，有所準備。</p>

<h3>喬路易自傳</h3>
<p>據喬路易的家人說：喬在這篇裏所講的話，怕是他有生以來最多的一次：他童年時代的佃戶生活（六）他成名爲拳擊家的经過（六）在他的許多對手中，他爲什麼最恨許墨林（六）他怎樣跟美陸軍裏的勁敵金克勞（Jim　Crow）對壘（六）他靠拳繫購來的錢，是怎樣化去的。（蒼龍譯）</p>
<p>人家問我：「喬，當你還一個小孩子的時侯，你可曾做過百萬富翁的夢，坐汽車，穿考究的衣服，口袋裏塞滿了錢？」我對他們說：「我不能做這樣豪華的夢。」的確，我小時候從來沒有夢想過這些東西，腦筋裏根本不轉這種念頭。</p>
<p>當我從拳擊一道裏竄出來時，報紙上寫了許許多多關於我的資料。有些事體因爲被一遍又一遍的煊染着，所以看來簡直像眞有其事。其實有一大部份是錯的。有些人說我生下來就生龍活虎似的，也有人說我天生一副殺相。其實我生下來就是一副呆手呆脚的樣子。我母親說我小時候常常摔交。她說當她出去工作的時候，常不放心留下我獨個兒在家裏，因爲我常常搗壞東西。</p>
<p>我是在一九一四年五月十三日，出生於美國阿拉巴瑪州的。我出生的那間棚　，看起來簡直一陣風就可以把它括倒。房子旣沒有漆，四週板壁鬆動，一副搖搖欲倒的樣子。我的爸爸叫孟祿巴羅（Munroe　Barrow）。他身長六呎三吋，體重巳近兩百磅。他死的時候，我才兩歲。</p>
<p>我母親現在已經六十二歲了。她是個好女人，永生做了浸禮敎會信徒，所以兒女們養大了，也都成爲該會的信從。在我還沒有靠拳擊賺錢之前，她爲我們這一羣操勞做生活。</p>
<p>我的母親做了兩次寡婦。她第二個丈夫名叫潘白羅（Pat　Brooks），也就是我的繼父。在兄弟的排行中，我僅次於最小的一位。潘跟我母親結婚時，自已也帶來了五個小孩子。</p>
<p>我母親說：在所有的兄弟中，我是個歡喜哭的壞孩子。哭起來是那麽長而響，非等到她動手打才會停。我不常生病，食量很大。當我還是個小孩子的時候，人家常問我是不是一個打手。其實我是不大跟人打架的，因爲我自制力很强，對任何事情，都是一笑置之。</p>
<p>但當我得了拳擊冠軍的時候，報館記者常說，要我講兩句話眞是難於登天。我母親說，她應該吿訴這些記者，我現在的樣子跟我小時孩子的時候差不多。我不像我的兄弟姊妹們一樣，把話說得淸淸楚楚。我上學的時候，先生常把同樣的字，叫我唸了一（二）又一遍。我喜歡獨個子玩。那時，我上難園工作還嫌小，我就帮着喂喂小雞和小猪，有時候也帮着檢棉花。那時候，我們連鞋子都不常穿，好衣服留着週日穿，棚屋裏晚上祇點煤油燈</p>
<p>有人想我現在大部份時間消耗在享受中，這也許是對的。但是回憶起我小時候過的日子，實在很少有機會享受。在阿拉巴瑪的那些年代中，我從未不懂得什麼叫做種族的事。那時候，我跟白種小孩子一起玩，我們從未談起過種族的色別。我明知道他們有我所沒有的東西－白色，但我把這些事情看得很天然。（未完）</p>

<h3>藍球聯賽出冷門恩卡斯大勝滬警</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晚籃球聯賽第二循環，滬警再戰恩卡斯，滿以爲滬警必可得勝，豈知大失所望，出了冷門，滬警以卅六比六十分遭遇空前慘敗，上半時十六比廿五滬警落後九分。賽前甲二組兩塲：（一）海豚勝晨友（甲二D），五十五比廿二，上半時廿六比八分。（二）美氣象勝平平（甲二C），六十比四十，上半時廿五此十五。</p>
<p>恩卡斯連敗數仗，每况愈下，大家看不起，昨晚生力軍上陣，美氣象隊之主持派德，被拉入作戰，頓時生氣蓬勃，派德爲一九四五－六年美全國海軍錦標隊隊負，大將風度，確屬不凡。投籃傳球，無論攻守，功夫相當細腻美觀。昨晚獨得廿四分，益以老將却利勃脫，恩卡斯遂如虎添翼</p>
<p>滬警上塲有些輕敵，迨番軍扶搖直上，欲趕已吿不及。恩卡斯高大身材，昨守衛嚴密，把滬警看管得動彈不得，梁永標何增何金貴人短都顯得無用，籃下球全在番軍手中，無從跟進。再進攻時，無從打破鐵幕，進不得籃下。力氣奔跑不如人，顧此失彼，滬警遂敗矣。</p>

<h3>Shanghai is the Essence of the Whole Country: The Communist Army Will Not Attack. Future Life May Have Considerable Changes. Yan and Others Responded to a Banquet Invited by Pan Gongzhan and Others Yesterday.</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday noon, Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Xu Jiliu, Deputy Speaker, Du Yuesheng, President of the Local Association, Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Communications, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, hosted a luncheon at Du's residence to welcome the three peace elders, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, who had just flown from Beijing to Shanghai. They represented the citizens of Shanghai in expressing their sincere appreciation. Although Mr. Du was ill yesterday, he still personally engaged in a lengthy conversation. There were no other people present, and they exchanged opinions with each other, all holding a strong belief in peaceful resolution. Although the three members of the peace delegation have maintained silence and refrained from divulging information since arriving in Shanghai, this newspaper's reporter has gleaned from their conversations a rough outline of future peace talks. The noteworthy points are: (1) The number of representatives for peace talks between the government and the CCP should be the same, in order to brainstorm ideas and allow both sides to fully discuss matters. It may even exceed four people per side. (2) Zhang Qun's repeated participation in important consultations after arriving in Beijing may be a symbolic indication that the government will appoint Mr. Zhang as one of the peace talk representatives. (3) The government must first seek internal unity and become a cohesive whole, which will make peace talks easier to conduct. (4) The terms of the peace talks will naturally have to wait until the talks begin and be negotiated between the two sides. The task of this peace delegation is to "knock on the door" and will not involve this scope. (5) Shanghai is the location of the nation's industrial and commercial essence. Destroying Shanghai will inevitably harm the nation's vitality, a point that both sides generally recognize. Furthermore, it appears that the CCP leaders have not considered attacking Shanghai by force. (6) Regardless, the way of life for the people will likely undergo considerable changes in the future. However, the CCP's conduct in larger cities they have occupied, such as Jinan, Beiping, and Tianjin, appears to differ from their previous conduct in inland cities and rural areas.</p>
<h3>Peace Talks to Proceed on an Equal Footing, May Begin in Mid-Month, Government Designates Ten People to Draft Plan, President Sun Receives Reporters and Explains Current Issues</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Day] President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, formally announced on the morning of the 3rd that peace negotiations between the government and the CCP would begin after the 15th of this month, and that the government is currently stepping up its efforts to study a peace plan. Mr. Sun stated that the Shanghai People's Peace Delegation, Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, Zhang Shizhao, and Shao Lizi, returned from Beiping and conveyed the CCP's view that they are willing to conduct peace talks with the government on an equal footing. For example, the CCP is willing to have an equal number of representatives for peace talks as the government. CCP officials have also indicated that it would be best to begin peace talks after March 15th. For this reason, Acting President Li specially convened a meeting of central and local leaders at 4 PM on the 1st of this month and designated ten people to be responsible for studying and drafting the government's peace plan. The research is currently underway and is expected to be completed within ten days. These ten key members are: Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, He Yingqin, Wu Zhongxin, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Fei, Wu Tiecheng, Zhong Tianxin, and Sun Ke, with Sun Ke serving as chairman. Mr. Sun emphasized that this plan is still under research and its contents have not yet been determined. However, to avoid misunderstandings and affecting peace talks, it is not convenient to publicly disclose it until it has been presented to the CCP and formally agreed upon.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun, at the request of reporters from various newspapers in the capital, held a press conference lasting one and a half hours at the International Recreation Club at 10:30 AM on the 3rd, explaining several important current issues, with particular emphasis on the peace issue. He also answered questions from the reporters. Vice President Wu Tiecheng, Deputy Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao, and others participated in the press conference. More than forty Chinese and foreign reporters attended. Mr. Sun's report included (1) the peace process and (2) the issue of political reform. Regarding political reform, Mr. Sun listed military service, grain administration, currency value, land reform, and other items, explaining each in detail.</p>
<p>The peace process is the issue of greatest concern to the people at present, and Mr. Sun first described its progress in detail. Mr. Sun stated that last month, Acting President Li went to Shanghai to invite Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, and Zhang Shizhao, as well as Shao Lizi from the government side, to go to Beiping. They have now returned to the capital. I have come to Beijing from Guangzhou and have met with the four and heard their reports. I am not at liberty to disclose the contents, as everything is still under discussion and preparation and has not yet reached the stage for public disclosure. Yan and the other three met with key CCP officials in Beiping and Shijiazhuang and obtained extremely valuable information and brought new hope. Although there are many difficulties in the future of peace, there is great hope. Both sides now understand that the fate and future of the country will be determined by the extent of their efforts towards peace. When I presided over the Executive Yuan two months ago, I advocated for peace negotiations. Eight years of resistance war and three years of civil war have led to continuous warfare, and the people cannot bear their suffering. The biggest issue going forward is how to find ways to achieve the goal of peace. In the Executive Yuan, my colleagues and I, under the leadership of President Chiang, consulted several times. Later, President Chiang, based on everyone's opinions and his own considerations, believed that China needed peace and issued a New Year's Day message advocating for peace. President Chiang's New Year's Day message indicated that the government was prepared and determined to seek peace through political means. Half a month later, we learned of CCP Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation, in which he mentioned eight conditions. At that time, the government's hesitation and concerns were that the government side was experiencing military defeats and the CCP side was experiencing military victories. We were concerned that the CCP would see itself as the victor and the government as the defeated party, adopting international practice, where peace terms are proposed by the victorious country and the defeated country can only obey without the right to offer opinions. If that were the case, there would be many difficulties in peace, and it would not be easy to overcome. Therefore, I proposed a simple idea at the time: we should achieve a glorious peace, meaning that both sides should negotiate on an equal footing and be able to propose conditions and exchange opinions and debate without limitations, so as to achieve a result. Only by negotiating on an equal footing can the results be fair and reasonable, and both sides can be convinced and accept them together. This time, the peace delegation returned from Beiping and explained that the CCP truly has the sincerity to seek peace and also has this understanding, that is, both sides will negotiate peace on an equal footing. The CCP stated that both sides are currently preparing and hope to begin negotiations after the 15th of this month. The government is also stepping up its preparations based on this point.</p>

<h3>Prince De Visits Ningxia</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Lanzhou, 3rd Day] Prince De, who had been staying in Lanzhou for a short time, took a special train to Ningxia on the morning of the 3rd for a visit, accompanied by Mongolian legislator Zhao Nasutu and others.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting to Be Held Today to Discuss Promoting National Peace Proposal, Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng Invite All Legislators in Beijing to Banquet</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Day] The second meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9 AM on the morning of the 4th. The items for discussion include a proposal by Zhang Huiwen and others to hold a plenary talk to discuss how to promote national peace. In addition, Xiao Juetian and twelve others proposed that the government's four declarations on protecting the people's basic freedoms and releasing political prisoners, etc., be confirmed in advance as necessary measures. They stated that the government issued four declarations on January 23rd, namely, the lifting of martial law, protecting the people's personal freedom, prohibiting illegal arrests and detentions, protecting freedom of speech, prohibiting the arbitrary closure of newspapers, abolishing special organizations and special courts, releasing students and political prisoners, restoring the status of the China Democratic League, and releasing Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, etc. These are all things that the Legislative Yuan has been seeking and that the people of the whole country desire. However, they have not been effectively implemented to date, or because of procedural issues, administrative efficiency has been reduced, and even special agents continue to arrest people outside of legal procedures, disregarding laws and orders to the extreme. As the Legislative Yuan resumes its sessions, in order to fight for freedom for the people, the Legislative Yuan should confirm in advance the four declarations of the government as necessary measures and order the Executive Yuan to be responsible for their effective implementation. If any military or political leaders violate these orders again, they should be dismissed and punished in order to appease the public's grievances and make the laws respected.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Day] Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet for all the legislators in Beijing at the International Recreation Club at noon on the 3rd, with more than two hundred people attending. Mr. Sun made a statement on the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou and reiterated his confidence in striving for peace, saying that the people urgently need peace, and the government will make its greatest efforts towards peace in order to comply with public opinion. As long as there can be a genuine and glorious peace, the sacrifice of individual and party interests will not be considered. In order to achieve this goal, the whole country must unite in order to strive for the realization of glorious peace. Tong Guanxian, Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, was also invited to attend. He made a speech on the spot, expressing his agreement with Mr. Sun's determination to strive for peace, and said that peace must be constructive, and political reform should be carried out simultaneously with peace. The banquet did not end until 2 PM.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Day] The anti-Sun Ke sentiment among the legislators is still very strong, and it was fully expressed at the second talk held by the legislators at 3 PM on the 3rd. This talk was jointly convened by Huang Yuren, Gan Jiaxin, Jiang Yiping, Chen Bosheng, Fan Yusui, Fei Xia, Liu Bomin, Tang Ruyan, Chen Guyuan, and others. Two hundred legislators attended, and Jiang Yiping chaired the meeting. Some people advocated sending a letter to Sun Ke, asking him to "resign honorably," but this motion failed to pass because the legislators' opinions were not entirely the same. It is generally expected that they will still follow "legal procedures" and question him in the Legislative Yuan when Mr. Sun reports on the government's policies. The mood at the talk on the 3rd was quite heated, with twenty-four people speaking, analyzing the two issues of peace talks and political reform, but no conclusions were reached. In the end, it was only decided to have the Legislative Yuan pass a resolution on the 4th to send a telegram to the whole country to support Acting President Li's peace proposal. Regarding the peace issue, it was decided to exchange opinions extensively before making a proposal. This proposal must first be submitted for review, and the details of the peace will be discussed after the peace talks begin. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Protests to the Garrison Headquarters, Stating That It Violates Constitutional Provisions</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] After this newspaper exposed the major conspiracy to subvert the government, people from all walks of life have paid great attention to it and expressed shock. However, the Supervisory Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces regrets that the handling of the case by law enforcement agencies in terms of procedures may be inappropriate. It is reported that the Supervisory Committee has submitted a formal protest to the Capital Garrison Headquarters. According to Ni Bi, a supervisor of the Supervisory Committee, when the chief of the investigation department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters arrested Xu Zhiyuan, he led military police into the Supervisory Committee's office at night, scaling the walls, and took him away. He also searched and took away three official documents of the Supervisory Committee. He did not produce an arrest warrant, nor did he inform the person in charge of the Supervisory Committee of the reasons for the arrest and provide a receipt, nor did he transfer him to a court with jurisdiction for trial within the statutory time limit. Mr. Ni stated that this "clearly violates the provisions of the Constitution, the Habeas Corpus Act, and the Criminal Procedure Law." As for Xu Zhiyuan himself, he was introduced to the Supervisory Committee when it was established last September, and he was appointed as a recommended investigator only after he obtained a guarantee in accordance with the law. His words and deeds were normal on weekdays, and whether he participated in the "conspiracy to subvert the government" should be determined based on evidence in accordance with the law. In addition to conducting an investigation into the truth, the Supervisory Committee will not comment for the time being. At the same time, Mr. Ni stated that the Supervisory Committee does not have a person named Meng Shiheng, who is one of the people involved in the case, as has been rumored.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The CCP radio station continued to criticize the United States yesterday, saying that Commander Badger's visit to Xiamen, Kaohsiung, and Keelung after leaving Qingdao was another conspiratorial activity by U.S. imperialism to support the Kuomintang government in continuing to launch a civil war. It also said that the U.S. Military Joint Advisory Group in China was ordered to retain its name and not return to the United States, but to work temporarily in Tokyo, as another clear proof of aid to the Kuomintang.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Aid to China Suggestions of Mr. Lapham</h3>
<p>Mr. Lapham, Director of the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, returned to the United States on the 15th of last month to report on the work of the China Branch to the Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Mr. Hoffman. Although this is a normal event, the question of whether the United States will continue to aid China in today's turbulent political situation is of the utmost concern to the people of the whole country. Therefore, we have unlimited expectations for Mr. Lapham's return to his country to report on his work. In addition, the term of the current aid-to-China program is about to expire, and the remaining aid-to-China funds are also small. Mr. Lapham's return to his country is now almost half a month, and no concrete indications have been seen from Mr. Lapham, which has increased the urgent concern of the Chinese people about whether US aid will continue.</p>
<p>But until yesterday, Mr. Lapham finally broke his silence and put forward his suggestions for continuing aid to China. According to a United Press report from Washington on the 1st, Mr. Lapham has suggested to the Economic Cooperation Administration in Washington that it immediately submit a request to Congress for an economic cooperation loan of US$240 million to the Chinese people. The term of this aid-to-China program is still set at one year, calculated at US$20 million per month, from June 30 this year to June 30 next year, requiring a total expenditure of US$240 million. At the same time, Mr. Lapham himself also told the press: "I am eager to attend Congress and ask for continued aid to China; but this economic cooperation program is not military aid. As long as the region where we are currently located does not fall into the hands of the CCP, we should continue to carry out aid to China. The current relief expenses in China are about US$20 million per month. If we decide to adopt a policy of not continuing to operate in any CCP-occupied areas, then we may not need as much as US$240 million in one year."</p>
<p>Although we have not seen the details of Mr. Lapham's continued aid-to-China program, we cannot help but be moved by Mr. Lapham's remarks, which are full of the valuable sympathy of friendly people for the Chinese people. China is a country with a backward industry. Although it has been called "an agricultural country" in the past, it has failed to improve due to its outdated production methods. Even farmers who work hard day and night cannot avoid freezing and starvation, and there is no question of industrialization. In recent years, the eight-year war of resistance and the three-year internal strife have devastated the rural areas, on which the people of the whole country depend for food and clothing, to the point of disrepair, completely changing its appearance compared to ten years ago. Under such circumstances, the Chinese people naturally hope that friendly countries can lend a helping hand. The motive is not to rely on foreign aid to solve the post-war livelihood problems, but its real purpose is to use this as capital for economic revival. However, in the three years after the war, the Chinese people have had another nightmare. The work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in China and the continuous economic aid to China by the US government have failed to save the Chinese people from fire and water. The Chinese people are naturally infinitely guilty and ashamed of their failure to make good use of foreign aid and to turn foreign aid into their own flesh and blood as a basis for future revival. However, they cannot help but express regret for the erratic nature of foreign aid, the insufficient amount of aid, and the fact that the aid goods often do not meet the needs. Therefore, although the Chinese people deeply understand the importance of their own efforts and regard "self-reliance" and "self-help" as golden rules, they still hope for the full assistance of friendly countries. We expressed this wish when Mr. Lapham returned to his country, and we were not disappointed to hear Mr. Lapham's remarks now. But when we study the nature of this aid-to-China program, it is purely a charitable relief program, and at best it is only a kind of "piecemeal" aid.</p>
<p>An economic cooperation fund of US$20 million a month is certainly not a small amount that can be ignored in today's situation where the national economy and people's livelihood are exhausted. However, if we want to use this as capital for our country's economic revival, it still feels like a drop in the bucket. If the aid is limited to this and there is no other assistance, then the economic cooperation fund of US$240 million in this year can only be regarded as a kind of alms from the United States to the suffering Chinese people, and it may not be able to play a role in reviving them. Therefore, we hope that the United States can truly broaden its horizons and never again take a "hot and cold" attitude towards aid to China. If it wants to provide assistance, it should provide full assistance, with both military and economic measures, so as to achieve the purpose of aiding China. Otherwise, piecemeal assistance will still not allow China to plan for economic revival, and it will inevitably delay the overall situation in the future.</p>
<p>When it comes to the issue of US aid to China, everyone admits that there is a common misconception between China and the United States today, that is, in the eyes of Americans, they always feel that China's own efforts are not enough, and they misunderstand that the Chinese people are solely daydreaming about the full assistance of the United States. President Truman once warned China, saying, "US aid cannot replace your own efforts." But in the eyes of the Chinese people, the piecemeal US aid is like a drop in the bucket, and they hope that the United States will be realistic and provide effective assistance. These two opposing views are both too subjective. We hope that China's own efforts can match US aid, and that US aid can also match China's own efforts.</p>
<p>In short, the trend of the United States continuing and expanding aid to China can be seen in Mr. Lapham's suggestions. But we earnestly hope that the full US aid to China will be realized as soon as possible. Do not let the Chinese people feel hot and cold again, and we must also prepare ourselves, work hard, and not ask about the existence or amount of foreign aid, but only save ourselves through hard work!</p>
<h3>Disruption of Traffic on the Yuehan Railway: Wounded Soldiers Cause Trouble at Chenxian Station, Engage in Fierce Fighting with Traffic Police, Resulting in Deaths on Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd] Traffic on the Yuehan Railway was announced to be disrupted after 6:00 PM on the 2nd. Southbound trains from Wuchang could only reach north of Chenxian, Hunan, while northbound trains from Guangzhou could only reach the northern border of Yuebei Lechang County (i.e., south of the county). The entire section of the Yuehan Railway within Chenxian is currently blocked by wounded soldiers, preventing trains from passing. According to a responsible person from the Yuehan Railway Bureau, the incident of wounded soldiers attacking the train was due to a freight train carrying commercial goods and livestock, which departed from Wuchang at the end of last month. When it passed through Chenxian on the 1st, it was intercepted by dozens of wounded soldiers who demanded to purchase the oxen on board. The train staff explained that the goods were being transported by the railway bureau on behalf of merchants and that they had no right to sell them. After repeated polite refusals proved ineffective, an argument ensued. However, the train staff outnumbered the wounded soldiers at the time, so the wounded soldiers did not resort to violence, and the train finally arrived in Guangzhou safely on the 2nd. However, the wounded soldiers later gathered more than a hundred wounded soldiers from various wounded soldier hospitals stationed in Chenxian, carrying light machine guns and other weapons, and ambushed near Chenxian Station on the Yuehan Railway on the afternoon of the 2nd. Coincidentally, another passenger train southbound from Wuchang passed through Chenxian at 6:00 PM that day and was surrounded by the ambushing wounded soldiers. The traffic police protecting the passenger train came forward to mediate, but due to some misunderstanding, a shootout broke out. Both sides exchanged machine gun fire and fought fiercely for a long time before gradually subsiding. After the incident, it was found that several passengers on the train had been killed by gunshots, one traffic policeman was killed, and one wounded soldier was killed. The entire Chenxian engineering section of the Yuehan Railway was destroyed, and most of a passenger train was damaged. The Railway Bureau has reported the attack to the authorities. It is reported that the authorities have telegraphed the garrison in Hengyang to go to Chenxian to suppress the situation, and it is expected that north-south rail traffic will be restored by the 4th.</p>
<h3>Situation in Northern Jiangsu Gradually Tightening: Communist Army Attempts to Seize Guazhou, National Army Crosses the River to Reinforce</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 3rd] A telegram from Zhenjiang states: 10,000 Communist troops began attacking Sanchahe, south of Yangzhou, today, in an attempt to seize Guazhou, the National Army's bridgehead north of the Yangtze River. A division of the National Army originally stationed in Zhenjiang has crossed the river to reinforce the Guazhou garrison, and the navy has also dispatched ships to the Guazhou river to assist in defense. In another telegram, National Army reconnaissance planes strafed Communist troops concentrated in the triangle between Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Zhenjiang today. (Another telegram) A naval patrol boat was shot at by 100 guerrillas near the port last night.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] At around 8:00 PM last night, a unit of over a hundred men from the Huaihai Independent Brigade of the Communist Army, carrying a mortar and several light and heavy machine guns, launched a surprise attack on the National Army's position in the area between Shijiaqiao and Sanchahe. The garrison, led by Wang Zuohua, counterattacked, and after a fierce battle of 30 minutes, the Communist troops fled north.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] According to the Communist People's Daily published in Yangzhou: "In order to open up the Grand Canal line, the People's Liberation Army must liberate various strongholds near the Yangtze River entrance of the canal, including Liuxu and Guazhou, which are under the control of the Kuomintang army."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] It is reported that around Yangzhou, a total of 40,000 Communist troops have gathered in recent days.

<h3>Suzhou City Defense Plan to Divide the City into Five Garrison Districts</h3>
<p>Responsibility Assigned to Baojia System to Implement Duty System</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] Commander Li Baichuan and Chief of Staff Wu Zhenya of the City Defense Headquarters hosted reporters yesterday, stating that since taking over on the 15th of last month, due to the lack of funds and equipment, they have only recently begun to formally carry out the work of maintaining order and security.

It is reported that the city will be divided into five garrison districts, and the Baojia heads under the administrative organs will be responsible for implementing the duty system. Every evening, each garrison district will control several key roads, allowing pedestrians to enter and exit freely, while the rest will be sealed off. During curfew hours, the curfew laws will be thoroughly enforced, so that incidents can be dealt with quickly. In addition, the practice of indiscriminately posting notices of government and family residences will be strictly prohibited. Military dependents must register their housing with the headquarters and await allocation. Furthermore, all documents issued by the previous City Defense Department are invalidated, and those who falsely claim to be officials or spread rumors will be severely punished. Finally, Commander Li called on the press to maintain close contact with the headquarters to achieve good cooperation between the military and civilians.</p>

<h3>Naval Headquarters in Contact with Chongqing Warship via Telegram: Central Bank Has No Gold Stored on the Ship</h3>
<p>Statement from the Director of the Political Warfare Department of the Naval Headquarters</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] News about the Chongqing warship has attracted much attention recently. Major General Tao Diya, Director of the Political Warfare Department of the Naval Headquarters, is currently in Shanghai on business. According to him, the Naval Headquarters is still trying to contact the ship via telegram. The truth will only be known after contact is made. However, many of the reports are inaccurate. For example, the Director of the Operations Department of the headquarters is currently in Nanjing and is not on the ship, and the Central Bank has no gold stored on the ship. Tao also denied the United Press report of a statement by a government naval spokesman in this city, saying that he had never met with reporters from the United Press or made any statements. Regarding the Reuters report of a statement by a crew member of the ship, claiming that he had asked Captain Zheng Tianjie of the Lingfu warship about this news, the captain stated that there were no crew members of the ship currently working as department store clerks in Shanghai. The statement is likely to have been fabricated by someone impersonating a crew member. The warship is currently inquiring with Reuters about this matter.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday's report contained a news item about the "Chongqing" warship being related to the transport of gold, stating: "Contact has been lost with the naval transport warship Chongqing, and there is much speculation. Some say that the warship is carrying gold and silver dollars from the National Treasury, but the relevant authorities have not acknowledged this. This morning, Ma Deji, director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and Dong Mu, commander of the First Naval District, jointly visited President Liu of the National Treasury, indicating that the disappearance of the warship is still closely related to the National Treasury," and so on. Yesterday, a spokesman for the National Treasury stated: "All the reported details are untrue. The transport of gold and silver to the south was stopped by the treasury a long time ago in compliance with orders. This morning, Director Ma of the Jiangnan Shipyard and Commander Dong came to the treasury to discuss business related to the shipyard and had no connection with the disappearance of the 'Chongqing' warship."</p>

<h3>Japanese Businesses Eager to Establish Trade Relations with Communist Areas: American Authorities in Tokyo Request Instructions from Washington</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 3rd] An American military headquarters spokesman told Agence France-Presse today that the American military authorities here are currently seeking instructions from Washington on the possibility of establishing trade relations with Communist areas. It is reported that several Japanese businessmen who have already contacted Japanese Communist leaders here, requesting that they write introductions to Shanghai in exchange for economic aid to the Japanese Communist Party, are now eagerly awaiting the resumption of trade with China. According to a spokesman for the Allied General Headquarters, this matter can only be decided by the Department of State. A spokesman for the Japanese Trade Agency stated that the Japanese government is not eager to urge the American authorities to expedite the establishment of trade relations with China under the current circumstances, but we still remember that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida has repeatedly stated that Japan is willing to trade with the Chinese Communist Party. According to Japanese official sources, several Chinese companies with general offices in Hong Kong and branches in the Northeast have already proposed to the Allied General Headquarters to conduct some form of barter trade between the Communist areas and Japan. It is reported that these companies are willing to exchange soybeans, coal, and salt for Japanese train carriages, textiles, and cement. However, business circles here are deeply afraid that the materials needed by the Communist Party may be rejected by the American authorities for strategic reasons. They believe that resuming trade with China will increase Japan's trade by 30% and greatly contribute to the early completion of Japan's economic recovery plan. They regret that trade between Japan and the areas ruled by the Chinese National Government after the war has been almost non-existent due to the civil war and the unwillingness of the Chinese authorities to engage in this trade. At the same time, they are also afraid that the prices of materials from the Communist side may be too high and doubt what impact the Communist occupation will have on the interests of foreigners in North China, such as mines. They also wonder if there will be any changes in prices.</p>

<h3>Building Hainan Island Must First Ensure Stability</h3>

Hainan has abundant resources, and the benefits of fishing, salt, forestry, and mining are also very rich. In the past, the prototypes of factories, mines, salt fields, and roads were roughly in place, but unfortunately, due to poor security, they were all abandoned. If they can be restored and expanded, the prospects for construction are limitless. Chen said that whether Hainan can be established as a province depends on how everything progresses. He will take office after all preparations are completed. In response to inquiries, Chen sincerely expressed his welcome to overseas Chinese to invest in and develop Hainan, and he will do his best to protect them.</p>

<h3>Old Capital Atmosphere Incorporated into Musical Composition: San Francisco Orchestra Performs "Beiping Hutong" in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service San Francisco, 2nd] The musical atmosphere of Beiping city streets from dawn to dusk. Arranged into a musical composition by Avshalomov, it was recently performed by the San Francisco Orchestra in a concert.</p>
<p>This work is titled "Beiping Hutong." Avshalomov rearranged the musical rhythms of the calls of Beiping vendors, barbers, noodle sellers, and other small merchants into a musical composition. These calls are used to attract customers.</p>
<p>Avshalomov said in an interview with reporters: "China is one of the most musically inclined countries in the world. During my many years of residence in China, I have never encountered a person without musical sensibility." He cited the calls of Beiping water carriers as an example to prove this point.</p>
<p>Avshalomov's interest is entirely focused on Chinese music. He spent most of his life in China. He was born in a small village in eastern Siberia, close to the Chinese border, and developed an interest in the music of his neighboring country early in life.</p>
<p>He said: "I am a composer whose life's work is to familiarize Westerners with the extremely varied and rich traditions of Chinese music, a tradition that was established long ago when Europeans were still living in caves."</p>
<p>When performing Avshalomov's musical composition, the San Francisco Orchestra used Chinese musical instruments for the first time.</p>
<h3>President Sun Explains Current Issues (Continued from Page One)</h3>
<p>Sun discussed the importance of the nation's difficulties, mainly due to military actions. If peace can be achieved smoothly, other difficulties can be resolved easily. Although the problem is difficult, some difficulties must be solved even before peace is achieved. This solution is the innovation of politics.</p>
<p>Changing Conscription to Voluntary Military Service is Imminent</p>
<p>Otherwise, there is no way to handle finances.</p>
<p>Regarding conscription, Sun pointed out that this is the greatest imposition on the people. Before the War of Resistance, the government, in order to strengthen national defense, formulated the Conscription Law and implemented conscription, which contributed greatly to the victory of the War of Resistance. However, conscription continued after the War of Resistance because it failed to achieve the ideal in reality. The implementation of conscription laws and regulations deteriorated and became oppressive, especially for the rural people. Therefore, colleagues and others advocate abolishing conscription and changing to a voluntary military system. The voluntary system can give people the freedom to choose whether or not to serve in the military, so the conscription system should be abolished. When discussing conscription, Sun also mentioned the huge military expenditure of the government, saying that the proportion of military expenditure in the government budget is the highest in the world, and the burden on the people is also the heaviest. He mentioned that when he first arrived at the Executive Yuan, he was shocked to hear that there were 6.3 million officers and soldiers in the country. He believed that even at the height of the War of Resistance, there were not that many officers and soldiers. However, regardless of whether there are actually this many now, all military pay and provisions are issued according to this number, which the government cannot afford. At that time, he advocated reducing it to 5.8 million people, but the financial and food authorities believed that it still needed to be reduced. Two weeks ago, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Food, and the Chief Accountant planned to reduce it to 4.2 million people. I personally believe that 4.2 million people is still too many, so a week ago, I proposed that the troop strength should be reduced to 2.5 million people. At that time, the discussion did not yield results. The Ministry of National Defense believed that there were too many difficulties, and reducing the troop strength to 4.2 million had already reduced as much as possible. The financial and food authorities believe that it cannot exceed 3 million people at most, otherwise, they will not be able to afford it. This matter has not yet been resolved. Acting President Li recently came to Guangzhou and discussed this matter. Acting President Li felt the same way and believed that it must be reduced, so there was a discussion of military reorganization. Military reform is an urgent task for the government, otherwise, there is no way to handle finances, the burden on the people cannot be reduced, prices cannot be stabilized, and inflation cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>Abolish the Grain Levy System, Elect Local Leaders</p>
<p>The Land Law should be thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>In addition to conscription, there are two other things that plague the people: one is the Grain Land Law should be thoroughly implemented, and the other is the value of currency. Sun said: During the War of Resistance, in order to replenish military food, grain was levied and borrowed, and the malpractices have been endless since then. The burden on rural areas is heavy, and tens of thousands of "grain officials" have been created out of thin air, but the amount is less than half of the military food, and the government still needs to pay for it. This system not only oppresses the people, but also makes the government feel wasteful, so it is decided to abolish it. At present, the value of currency is depreciating day by day, and price fluctuations are huge, threatening the lives of the people. The fundamental solution is to restore peace, stop military actions, massively reduce the military, and reduce military expenditure. At present, we are only starting with temporary measures, that is, the financial and monetary reform plan recently passed by the Executive Yuan, allowing free buying and selling of gold and silver, minting silver dollars, and paying military salaries in silver dollars. Customs duties are changed to collect customs gold units, the purpose is to ensure the value of tax revenue so that the government's revenue and expenditure can gradually move towards balance. Sun further admitted some past mistakes of the government, such as the fact that the foundation of local autonomy has not been established even after the establishment of the National Government for more than 20 years. Excessive centralization of power has made local politics numb. The constitution stipulates the separation of powers between the central and local governments. Regardless of how this constitution will be in the future, it should still be thoroughly implemented at present, with clear division of powers and responsibilities, and local leaders should also be elected by the people. Regarding land reform, Sun said: The Legislative Yuan formulated the Land Law during the time of President Hu Hanmin, but it has not been thoroughly implemented. The central government only implemented a part of the land tax collection. In the future, it should still be implemented according to the spirit of the law, simplifying the provisions. The Land Law was formulated based on the spirit of the Principle of People's Livelihood, not because the Chinese Communists implemented land reform and we began to imitate it.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Move to Guangzhou for Office Work Was Approved by the Acting President.</p>
<p>Misunderstandings from the outside world are regrettable.</p>
<p>President Sun also said: Recently, there have been many misunderstandings from the outside world regarding the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou for office work. In fact, the government's move to the south was prepared and acted upon by military and political organs in Beijing long before I took over as head of the Executive Yuan. With the war north of the Yangtze River becoming increasingly tense, and the Communist forces' vanguard having reached a place less than 15 kilometers from Pukou, the capital felt threatened. The ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, with the approval of Acting President Li, moved to Guangzhou for office work. The Secretariat of the Presidential Office and other Yuan and Council organs also moved away from Nanjing one after another to ensure safety. I formally notified friendly envoys on January 26 that the Executive Yuan was moving to Guangzhou for office work and requested them to move with it. Later, with the approval of Acting President Li, I went to Guangzhou with Vice President Wu on February 4. Unexpectedly, people who did not know the truth speculated a lot about this, which is very regrettable. I am very happy to be able to reunite with you here. What I deeply hope is that you will closely cooperate with the government so that the government's desire to seek peace and reform politics can be realized as soon as possible, which the vast majority of the people in the country rely on.</p>
<p>Immediately Responding to Ten Important Questions from Reporters</p>
<p>Returning to Guangzhou After Finishing Business in Beijing</p>
<p>Sun's explanation lasted 45 minutes before it ended. Afterwards, he immediately responded to questions raised by reporters. The important ones were: (1) Is it true that there are differences of opinion between the government and the Yuan on the peace issue, as rumored? Sun said that there were no differences of opinion. (2) Will President Sun return to stability or stay in Beijing? Sun said: Of course, I have to return to Guangzhou. Guangzhou is the seat of the government, and Nanjing is the center of peace talks, so both sides must be taken care of. Once the matters here are finished, I will return to Guangzhou. (3) During this evacuation, some ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan failed to handle matters properly, which affected the work mood of provincial and municipal government affairs and staff. Will there be any handling of this? Sun said: We will investigate the situation and study and decide separately. (4) It is said that the Executive Yuan will be partially reorganized. Has a decision been made on personnel? Sun said: It has not been decided yet, so I cannot give a specific report. (5) Will mediation by the United Nations on the Chinese Communist issue be effective? Sun said: I believe that the effectiveness of mediation by the United Nations is very small. It is better to have direct negotiations. In order to consistently seek peace, the Chinese government certainly welcomes assistance from all parties, but the United Nations is limited by the provisions of the Charter and cannot easily participate in mediating a country's domestic problems. (6) When Evatt announced the request for the United Nations to mediate, President Sun expressed welcome. Now, he says that mediation is not easy. Has the situation changed between the two times? Sun said: Mediation must be accepted by both parties to be effective. After Evatt's speech, the Chinese Communists expressed their opposition, so mediation by the United Nations will not be effective. (7) Why have the government authorities failed to implement the seven measures announced by Acting President Li? Sun said: The Executive Yuan has discussed and decided on these seven measures. One or two of them have been handed over to the Ministry of National Defense for research due to technical problems. The so-called Zhu Shi Xing Zhe is in the research of the Ministry of National Defense. (8) Is the Taiwan Provincial Government's restriction on people entering the country an order from the Executive Yuan? Sun said: The Executive Yuan has no such order. I think it is a measure by the local authorities. (9) Has President Sun heard that Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi has engaged in corruption? Sun said: I have seen this matter reported in the newspapers, but I do not know the details. I heard that the Control Yuan is conducting an investigation. (10) What criticism does President Sun have of Qi Butong's long letter? Sun said: I have not seen this letter. This is a private misunderstanding and a legal issue.</p>

<h3>North Atlantic Treaty Draft Negotiations Approaching Final Stage Britain and France Support Italy's Participation in the Treaty</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Washington, 3rd Broadcasting: Norwegian Ambassador to the United States, Morgenstierne, visited Deputy Secretary of State Acheson today for 20 minutes. (2) He said, "I have not yet received instructions from the Norwegian government regarding the North Atlantic Treaty. If the government orders me to request to participate in the discussion of the treaty and can obtain a formal invitation, then Norway will participate in the discussion."</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Acheson said today that the countries negotiating the North Atlantic Treaty do not have major differences. This process, which has been negotiated for six months, is now entering the final stage. Ambassadors from Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg are consulting their own countries on some new proposals. It is hoped that another meeting can be held on Thursday to complete the draft treaty. It is hoped that the full text can be published before the formal signing. Acheson also revealed that participants in the negotiations are currently discussing the possibility of other countries joining the treaty.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 2nd] According to reliable sources, the British Foreign Office has received seven of the ten articles contained in the Atlantic Treaty. Experts are currently studying them closely.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 2nd] It is learned that the negotiators of the North Atlantic Security Treaty can decide this week whether to invite Italy to participate. It is heard that Italy has expressed that if it wants to invite Italy to participate, Italy is willing to become a fundamental country of the treaty. Representatives from the countries currently participating in the negotiations here deny that they oppose Italy's participation in the treaty. Britain's attitude is that if the United States decides to invite Italy to participate, Britain will support the United States' proposal. The United States once advocated Italy's joining the treaty, but some senators strongly opposed this move. As for France, due to its close economic, geographical, and strategic ties with Italy, it advocates Italy's participation in the treaty. In addition, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, and Iceland are generally also on the list of countries to be invited to participate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press Copenhagen, 2nd] Well-informed sources said that Denmark may formally accept the invitation from the seven countries of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Canada tomorrow to participate in negotiations on the North Atlantic Joint Defense Treaty.</p>
<h3>Rumor that the Soviet Bloc Intends to Negotiate a Military Alliance to Counter the West Under the Mutual Assistance Treaty, the Soviet Union Will Pressure Finland</h3>
<p>[United Press Prague, 2nd] It is said that the Comintern countries in Eastern Europe are planning to formulate a military alliance to supplement political and economic ties. According to news from Poland today, the Comintern intends to convene a military conference in Hungary around the 15th of this month. Although this information has not yet been confirmed here, foreign observers do not find it surprising.</p>
<p>It is believed that the six countries of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia may form a military alliance to counter the North Atlantic Alliance, just as the Soviet Union announced the formation of an economic alliance a month ago to counter the Marshall Plan. Reliable sources in Warsaw reported today that the Eastern European military conference may be held in Teberlesen, Hungary, in the middle of the month, and military generals from various Eastern European countries will attend. An observer from a certain country here said that such meetings have been held several times before, but Hungarian officials denied that military generals from various Eastern European countries have held any talks within the country.</p>
<p>[United Press Helsinki, 3rd] According to a Social Democratic Party spokesman close to the government, it is expected that negotiations will begin next week to invite the Communist Party to join the cabinet, because if the Soviet Union invokes the Finnish-Soviet Friendship Treaty, the Fagerholm Cabinet may not be the best cabinet to negotiate with the Soviet Union. According to this treaty, the Soviet Union has the right to ask Finland for new bases when it feels that its national security is threatened. Non-Communist parties in Finland are afraid that if Norway and Denmark join the North Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet Union may take this action.</p>
<h3>Communist Leaders in Europe and the United States Unanimously Support the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters Oslo, 2nd] The Chairman of the Norwegian Communist Party, Lovlien, gave a speech here today, stating that the Norwegian Communist Party should maintain a consistent position with the Soviet Union in both peacetime and wartime, and must also be in step with the Communist parties in France, Italy, and Britain. According to reports, the leaders of the British, French, and Italian Communist parties have recently made similar remarks, expressing their support for the will of the Soviet Union under any circumstances.</p>
<p>[Reuters Vienna, 3rd] Following the leaders of the Communist parties in France, Britain, and Italy, the Austrian Communist Party's organ, the People's Times, published an editorial today, stating that if a war breaks out, the Austrian Communist Party will stand on the same front as the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 2nd] Two senior American Communist Party members declared today that if a war breaks out between the United States and the Soviet Union, they will cooperate with the democratic armies to defeat the predatory war goals of American imperialism." This statement was issued by Communist Party Chairman Foster and Secretary-General Dennis, following the recent pro-Soviet military declarations by the leaders of the French and Italian Communist parties. Dennis and ten others are accused of conspiring to advocate the overthrow of the American government by force, but Foster is temporarily exempt from trial due to a serious heart condition.</p>
<h3>Rumors of a U.S.-British-Egyptian Alliance The British Side Says They Know Nothing</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 3rd] A British Foreign Office spokesman recently denied the Cairo rumors that the United States had suggested signing a tripartite alliance with Britain and Egypt, stating that they knew nothing about this suggestion. Diplomats also believe that the report is unlikely, as the U.S. Constitution does not allow the United States to participate in foreign alliances.</p>
<h3>West German Constitution Draft Not Approved Returned to the Constitutional Assembly for Revision</h3>
<p>[Reuters Frankfurt, 3rd] After studying the constitution drafted by the West German Constitutional Assembly for two days, the military commanders of the three Western occupying powers in West Germany, the American Clay, the British Robertson, and the French Koenig, jointly notified the assembly today that the draft constitution was not acceptable to the occupying authorities and severely criticized the assembly for its poor performance. The three commanders' main criticisms of the constitution are roughly divided into the following points: (1) The powers of the federal government are still vaguely defined. In order to ensure that the powers of the democratic government can be exercised smoothly after the end of the occupation, its powers still need to be more specifically defined. (2) The articles on authorizing the central parliament to promulgate civil and criminal laws still need to be revised, as the existing articles may create a highly centralized system again. (3) The central government should only have partial power to collect taxes, and local governments should share a portion of the power and participate in the decision-making of tax distribution. (4) The taxes collected by the central authorities should only be limited to maintaining the expenses of the central administrative organs. There are eight other minor revisions. This constitution, which contains a total of 139 articles, has now been returned to the West Constitution Assembly of Bonn for new revisions.</p>
<h3>Soviet Refugee Group Will Be Enforced to Evacuate if They Do Not Withdraw</h3>
<p>The American Military Authorities in Germany Stated</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 3rd] The Soviet refugee group trapped in Falkensee is still guarding its office today, refusing to withdraw from the American military zone. The deadline for the American occupation authorities to order their withdrawal is approaching and preparations are being made for enforcement. The water, electricity, gas, telephone, and food supply of the port have been cut off for 36 hours. According to authoritative sources, the American side has prepared to enter the office, escort the people inside onto trucks, and send them to the border between the American and Soviet occupation zones for entry into the Soviet zone. Soviet Commander Sokolovsky made a statement on the matter yesterday, calling Clay's action a "shameful police action," proving that the Soviet side was tearing up its goodwill.</p>
<h3>Southeast Asian Regional Conference to be Held in India in Early April The Commonwealth Conference Will Form an Anti-Communist Alliance</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 2nd] The State Department announced on the 2nd that the Southeast Asian Regional Conference will be held in New Delhi in the first week of April so that representatives from various agencies of the Washington government and representatives from the State Department will have the opportunity to exchange views informally. The State Department said that this is a type of diplomatic conference that is often held in other parts of the world. The region for this conference is Southeast Asia, from Iran to the Philippines.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 2nd] The governments of the British Commonwealth are planning to take a "new approach" to the problem of Southeast Asia in order to stop the expansion of communism. A senior Commonwealth government source said on the 2nd that the main result of the New Delhi Burma Conference on the 28th was the decision to "reach an understanding with genuine nationalists." They said that the formation of this policy will be discussed at the Commonwealth Conference to be held in Ottawa or Colombo. Commonwealth government sources said that the decisions made at the planned Commonwealth Conference "will make China's transformation into communism even more important than India." They agreed that the development of events pointed to the ultimate establishment of a center for a "united government" to resist the expansion of communism in Southeast Asia. In Burma, the main effort will be to separate the Karen rebellion from communist activities. In Malaya, efforts will be made to cultivate the established Malayan Chinese Federation movement. Commonwealth government sources believe that the planned Commonwealth talks are consistent with the Western alliance and the Atlantic Treaty.</p>

<h3>Another Soviet Soldier Who Escaped to Japan Believes That the United States and the Soviet Union Will Conflict</h3>
<p>He Predicts That Capitalism Will Win</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 3rd] Soviet Army soldier Chiyanov, who escaped to Japan last autumn, told reporters here today, "The Soviet Union intends to build an airport on the Kuril Islands, only 20 miles from Japan. I don't believe that the Soviet Union already has atomic bombs, but it is said that it will have one in the future, because Molotov said so." Chiyanov said that he saw three Soviet four-engine bombers in southern Kuye Island in 1946. Chiyanov believed that a war between the United States and the Soviet Union would break out soon, initiated by the Soviet Union, but predicted that capitalism would win. The Soviet army made two moves to the Far East last year, and its internal propaganda said that the Soviet Union must always be prepared for war. Chiyanov intends to go to the United States, but the American military has not yet expressed its position.</p>
<h3>Thai King Nu's Statement No Longer Joining the British Commonwealth</h3>

<p>[Reuters Rangoon, 3rd] Burmese Prime Minister Thai King Nu issued a written statement today, solemnly stating that he will not consider rejoining the British Commonwealth, and even if he does join, it will not solve Burma's internal problems. The Burmese have been struggling for goose independence for a long time. Even if there is internal unrest, they are determined not to reconnect with Britain in the old relationship.

<p>[Central News Agency Rangoon, 2nd] Burmese government officials revealed today that the war launched by the Karen tribe in the areas of Mantschule and the Delta is in cooperation with the Communist Party, but in the Pegu area, the Karen and the Communist Party have not yet reached an agreement.

<h3>Continued Negotiations of the Four Powers on the Austrian State Treaty - U.S. Representative Proposes Suggestions - Advocates for the Protection of Slovak Rights in Austria</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, 3rd Broadcast: During today's discussion of the Austrian State Treaty by the representatives of the four foreign ministers, the U.S. representative, Lee Bo, proposed that in responding to Yugoslavia's demands, the representatives of the four foreign ministers should advocate for greater rights for the Slovak minority in Austria, namely: (1) the establishment of Slovak schools; (2) the use of the Slovak language in all official and commercial documents; (3) the freedom of association for Slovaks; and (4) equality for Slovaks in political and civil rights. The United States argues that all signatory countries should guarantee the realization of the above points. The Soviet representative, Chailupin, believes that these points are still far from meeting Yugoslavia's demands, but did not discuss the details. Today, the representatives received a lengthy memorandum from Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber, denying Yugoslavia's accusation that Austrian authorities are oppressing the Slovak people.</p>

<h3>Sweden Refutes Soviet Note - Accuses the Soviet Union of Interfering in Swedish Internal Affairs - Declares Absolutely No Intention to Prevent Foreign Nationals from Returning Home</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 2nd] It is officially announced here that after the Soviet Union sent a note to Sweden on February 28th accusing Sweden of excluding Latvian, Estonian, and Lithuanian nationals within its borders, the Swedish government presented a reply to the Soviet Embassy here tonight, directly rejecting the Soviet accusations.</p>
<p>The reply stated that the Swedish Foreign Ministry was extremely surprised to receive the Soviet note accusing Sweden of using improper methods to prevent nationals of the Baltic countries from returning to their home countries. The Swedish police, like the Swedish authorities, have absolutely no intention of preventing any foreign nationals residing in Sweden from going to the Soviet Union. The note continued, stating that according to Swedish law, every individual, whether Swedish or foreign, enjoys full protection against unwarranted interference or arbitrary treatment. At the same time, Swedish legal experts believe that the Soviet Union's note to Sweden is a direct interference in Sweden's internal affairs. They also pointed out that of the 26,000 Baltic nationals in Sweden, less than one percent have returned to their home countries in the past two years. Swedish newspapers believe that the Soviet note is part of a psychological war being waged in Scandinavia.</p>

<h3>The Netherlands Disregards the Security Council Resolution, Showing the Extreme Seriousness of the Indonesian Issue - U.S. Representative Supports the Mediation Committee Report</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 2nd] The report of the United Nations Indonesian Mediation Committee to the Security Council regarding the situation in Indonesia concludes that the Dutch government has not complied with the Security Council's resolution passed on January 29th requesting an immediate ceasefire, the release of the Republican leaders, and the restoration of the Yogyakarta government.

<h3>U.S. B-50 Superfortress Uses Aerial Refueling - Can Bomb Any Soviet Base - "Lucky Lady II" Has Achieved Amazing Results in U.S. Air Force History</h3>
<p>[United Press, Fort Worth, Texas, 2nd] The U.S. Air Force today completed the first non-stop round-the-world flight in history. The Boeing B-50 mid-bomber "Lucky Lady II", carrying a crew of fourteen, secretly took off eastward from Carswell Air Force Base here on the 26th. It safely returned to base today at 3:22 PM standard time (11:22 PM Shanghai time), taking 94 hours and 1 minute. The entire journey covered 23,425 miles, with an average speed of 239 miles per hour, refueling in the air four times along the way. The air force's top officials came to the airfield to warmly welcome them. The authorities believe that the test flight has yielded some important strategic lessons. According to the pilot of the aircraft, Colonel Galagher, at a press conference, this event proves that the B-50 can bomb any region in the world at any time. When asked if Air Force Strategic Commander LeMay could use the air refueling method to drop atomic bombs on various parts of the Soviet Union, Lee hesitated slightly before answering, "It's better to say that it can drop bombs wherever atomic bombs are needed." The flight route had been agreed upon in advance with the countries along the way, but carefully avoided flying over the Soviet Union. Its closest point to the Soviet Union was near Karachi, still hundreds of miles from the Soviet border. During the war, the B-29 Superfortress was used to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs, but after the war, the B-50 took its place. The plane flew over the Azores, and a B-29 received a radio message and took off from Lajes Field to refuel it. The second refueling was in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, two hours and fifty-five minutes earlier than planned. The third refueling was in the Philippines, one hour and twenty-five minutes earlier than planned, and the fourth refueling was in Hawaii, fifty-eight minutes earlier. Finally, it returned to the control tower here, almost exactly as planned. According to Lee, one of the purposes of this secret flight was to test the military safety of four aerial refuelings and whether the flight could be completed without leaking secrets.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, San Francisco, 2nd] "Lucky Lady II" used two tanker planes to refuel in the air. Using this type of tanker plane puts any Soviet base within range of American bomber formations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Fort Worth, Texas, 2nd] The U.S. new-style B-50 bomber "Lucky Lady II" returned to its original airfield on the 2nd. Secretary of the Air Force Symington, Air Force Chief of Staff General Vandenberg, Air Force Strategic Commander Lieutenant General LeMay, and Commander of the Eighth Air Force Division Rear Admiral Remey were all on the scene to congratulate the crew.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Members of Congress, in light of the B-50 bomber's feat of completing a non-stop round-the-world flight, are once again advocating for expanding the air force and strengthening national defense. Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Tydings declared that the flight has adequately demonstrated the extent to which World War III would involve all of humanity, and the air force is becoming increasingly important to the entire national defense. Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee all believe that the hope of Congress approving additional funding for the air force has been greatly enhanced.</p>

Agreements have been reached on the principles and specific measures related to navigation. Shipping between Tianjin and Shanghai will soon be unimpeded. Representatives from the Shanghai shipping industry, such as Wei Wenhan, went to Tianjin on the 2nd to participate in the preparation for the establishment of a unified ship allocation organization and other related navigation work. The radio station also stated that the North China People's Government, in order to facilitate the movement of merchants and people and restore navigation between Tianjin and Shanghai and other places, issued "Temporary Measures for Wartime Ship Management in the North China Region" on the 1st. The main provisions of the temporary measures are: (1) Chinese ships applying to the Navigation Administration Bureau of this region and receiving a permit after approval are allowed to sail between ports in this region and other ports.

<h3>Tangshan Ship to Head North Again Tomorrow - Yongxing and Eight Other Ships Permitted to Participate</h3>

<h3>Postmaster General Visits Yan Huiqing - Inquires About North-South Postal Communication</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Postmaster General Gu Chunfan visited Yan Huiqing yesterday morning to inquire about the results of negotiations on North-South postal communication. Due to Mr. Yan having many guests, the discussions were brief and he left. It is said that the Communist Party has expressed its agreement in principle to navigation and postal communication, but requires the post office and shipping industry to formally send representatives to Peiping to discuss the details of implementation. It is also said that Mr. Yan Huiqing said that although communication and navigation between Shanghai and the Communist-controlled areas of North China have now begun, they are not ideal due to various conditions and restrictions. In recent days, he has been in close contact with the ambassador and shipping leader Du Yuesheng and Postmaster General Gu Chunfan. It is generally expected that this issue will have further development soon.</p>
<h3>Through Train to Southern Guangdong - Can Be Realized with Accelerated Preparation</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Ministry of Communications, in order to connect transportation between South China and Central China, instructed the Shanghai-Nanjing, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureaus in January of this year to formulate a through train plan to southern Guangdong, and decided to start through train service on January 11th, scheduled to run once a week. However, due to the ordered evacuation along the Shanghai-Nanjing line and insufficient allocation of trains, this plan could not be realized. It has been learned that the Ministry of Communications has not abandoned its ideal of realizing the through train to southern Guangdong. The Railway Joint Transportation Office has recently notified the Shanghai-Nanjing, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou Bureaus to accelerate the preparation for through train service. It is said that the bureaus are actively proceeding, and once the technical problems are resolved, the through train service to southern Guangdong can be realized.</p>
<h3>Mayor to Convene Meeting Today to Discuss Subsidy for Garrison Troops' Non-Staple Food</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The subsidy for the non-staple food of the garrison troops in this city is far from sufficient due to the impact of rising prices on the funds allocated by the government. The local authorities have been responsible for planning. The municipal government has guaranteed the minimum amount of physical goods (i.e., one and a half pounds of firewood and one pound of vegetables per person per day), which will be planned by the Military-Civilian Cooperation Committee. According to the reporter's inquiry to the relevant authorities yesterday: a total of 300 million yuan was raised in February, all of which were apportioned by the various industry trade associations and allocated by the Military-Civilian Cooperation Committee to the various district offices. As for the total amount of the non-staple food subsidy for March, it has not yet been decided as of yesterday. It is said that it is impossible to estimate the extent of the rise in prices in advance, and once the currency system depreciates, it will be insufficient for distribution. Therefore, the authorities are preparing to formulate a more thorough method, or base it on physical objects. Mayor Wu is scheduled to convene a meeting of the Military-Civilian Cooperation Committee and representatives of various trade associations in this city in the municipal office conference room at 3:00 PM today to discuss specific measures.</p>
<h3>Rumor That the Municipal Government Received Evacuation Funds is Completely a Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Regarding the rumor that the municipal government has received a huge amount of evacuation funds, the municipal government spokesperson solemnly denied this to reporters yesterday, saying that there is absolutely no such thing and it is purely a misunderstanding. When the city was rushing to build defense works some time ago, because the funds had not been allocated by the central government, the municipal government requested the Central Bank to advance several hundred million yuan for emergency use, and used the city's special defense donation as collateral. This expense has now been returned to the municipal government by the central government, which caused outside misunderstandings and led to this rumor. The spokesperson also said: The central government did approve the allocation of funds for evacuation when the military situation is tight, but will not pre-allocate them until the enemy is at the gates, so the above rumor is too early to say.</p>
<h3>Customs Has Not Yet Received Order to Levy Tariffs in Customs Gold Units</h3>
<p>Increased Import Tax Revenue in February</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] According to Zhang Yongnian, Director of the Jianghai Customs, when speaking to reporters yesterday, although the financial reform plan has explicit provisions for levying taxes in customs gold units, the customs has not yet received formal instructions, so implementation is still pending. Before receiving an order to change the system, everything will still be handled according to the existing regulations.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the import tax revenue of the Jianghai Customs totaled 1.5 billion yuan from January and February of this year. Of this, January accounted for about 500 million, and February accounted for about 1 billion yuan. The increase in tax revenue in February was due to the fact that commodity prices rose and tax revenue increased accordingly, and secondly, imports in February were slightly higher than in January.</p>
<p>Also, there is much misunderstanding about the settlement of gold yuan and customs gold units. According to the responsible person of the National Bank, the ratio of customs gold units to gold yuan on that day was calculated based on the closing price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate on the previous day, at a ratio of four jiao (cents) in US currency per customs gold unit.</p>
<h3>Council Completes Deliberation on Motor Vehicle License Tax Rate</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Bureau of Public Works has drafted an adjustment to the construction donation rate for motor vehicles in the city for the 38th year, which has been approved by the municipal government and sent to the Municipal Council. It will begin collecting in mid-March after the Council's reply is received. In addition, the Council has completed deliberation on the license plate tax rate for motor vehicles in the 38th year and has replied to the Municipal Finance Bureau for implementation.</p>
<h3>Director Urges Collection of Land Value Tax - Director Inspects Various Units</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Shen Zhenjia, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, in order to improve the work efficiency of the bureau's personnel and urge the accelerated collection of land value tax, inspected the various units under the bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday, accompanied by Chief of the Third Section Xie Juntao, Secretary Qian Ying, and reporters. He first went to the Huangpu District Land Value Tax Calculation Office, then to the Fahua District Land Value Tax Calculation Office, then to the Zhabei Yinxiang District Land Value Tax Calculation Office, and finally to the fifth, eighth, ninth, and third sections, and the technical office and the statistics office, the second section drawing group, in the Ziyuan Building on Sichuan Road Bridge. The inspection was completed at about 5:00 PM. All of the units were working intensely. According to Director Shen, there are a total of 170,000 plots of land in the city, and the land value tax is estimated to be 230 million yuan. In the past, it accounted for one-third of the city government's total revenue. Now, due to the continuous fluctuation of prices and the inability to adjust the land value tax at any time, the land value tax revenue has been reduced. The municipal bank sends personnel to collect the taxes at each collection office and remits them into the city treasury at any time. The Land Administration Bureau is only responsible for calculation, notification, and collection.</p>

<h3>National University Presidents from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Other Regions Return to Shanghai After Petitioning in Beijing; Solution for Adjusting Salaries and Funding Being Studied, Advance Payment for March Expenses and Food Storage Fees</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Zhizhuo, Zhu Kezhen, Zhang Yi, Xia Jianbai, and other presidents of sixteen national universities and colleges from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places, went to Beijing to petition on the evening of the 27th of last month regarding funding, salaries, and contingency funds. In Beijing, they met with Acting President Li, Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan, and Acting Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, presenting various requests. Regarding the fundamental solution for adjusting salaries and funding according to the local cost of living index in the future, the Executive Yuan is currently studying it comprehensively and a decision is expected soon. In consideration of the current financial difficulties of the schools and the difficult living conditions of faculty and staff, the Executive Yuan has made an emergency allocation of 764,005,000 yuan for the March expenses of each school based on a standard of 500 times the original amount. In addition, 430,038,900 yuan has been issued to each school for three months of food storage expenses. After achieving these results, the university presidents left Beijing the night before last, and the presidents of the schools in this city arrived back here yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Salary Issues</p>
<p>The specific requests made by the university presidents to Acting Minister Chen in Beijing totaled nine items, as detailed in previous reports. Acting Minister Chen believed that it would be difficult to calculate salaries based on the current original salary without discounts, multiplied by the local cost of living index. After considering this, the university presidents agreed that the base amount could still be calculated using the existing discount method, but insisted that the multiplier must be based on the local cost of living index. The Executive Yuan immediately instructed the university presidents to prepare a rough budget. At that time, the lower-period cost of living index for Shanghai in February (643 times) had not yet been released. The sixteen university presidents estimated 500 times the original amount and prepared a budget for the additional payments due for February and the expenses for March, including student stipends, professor research funds, etc., totaling 1,528,810,000 yuan. Acting Minister Chen considered the figure too large and approved half of it, temporarily issuing 764,005,000 yuan for March expenses based on 500 times the original amount. Each school received an allocation based on its enrollment and immediately distributed salaries to faculty and staff, as well as academic research funds and student stipends, based on 500 times the original amount. In addition, the base amount for student food allowances has been increased from 4.20 yuan to 10 yuan, and academic research funds have been increased to 200 yuan for full professors, 150 yuan for associate professors, 100 yuan for lecturers, and 50 yuan for teaching assistants. The average base salary for laborers is 40 yuan, and for technicians, 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Contingency Funds</p>
<p>Regarding the contingency fund issue, the university presidents originally requested a one-time issuance of three times the new standard for each requested expense. Premier Sun proposed a compromise solution, allocating food storage fees to the sixteen schools based on a calculation of two dou of rice per person per month, totaling six dou for three months, amounting to 430,038,900 yuan. Premier Sun stipulated that this amount could only be used for collective food storage and could only be used in emergencies, and that the purchase and use of grain must be reported to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the decreasing number of government-funded students and the increasing number of poor students at each school, the university presidents requested the Ministry of Education to allow each school to designate two-tenths of the total student population as work-study students. Acting Minister Chen believed that it was impossible to increase the number of government-funded students for now, but the vacant government-funded slots at schools in North China could be allocated to the schools here. If necessary, each school could handle this within the range of two-tenths of the number of self-funded students, at its own discretion.</p>
<p>Petitioning Schools</p>
<p>The schools that participated in the petition in Beijing and received funding were National Chiao Tung University, Fudan University, Tongji University, Jinan University, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai College of Commerce, Wusong Merchant Marine College, Music College, Senior Mechanical Vocational School, Kindergarten Teacher Training College, Zhejiang University, Henan University, College of Social Education, Jiangsu Medical College, Arts College, Tangshan Institute of Technology, and sixteen other units.</p>
<h3>Treatment of National Army: A Soldier's Salary Table – Private's Monthly Income of 300 Gold Yuan Only Enough to Buy Fifteen Pancakes; Ministry of National Defense Planning to Improve Conditions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Under the state of preparing for war and seeking peace, many troops have been stationed in Shanghai. Not counting the troops passing through, what is the exact strength of the troops stationed in Songhu? What are the unit designations and locations? This concerns military secrets and cannot be published. However, the total strength of the entire Songhu Garrison Area is approximately 200,000 troops, stationed in the four suburbs of the city. According to a person in charge of a certain military organization, with the current troop strength, ensuring the security of Songhu is not a problem. Because there are too many troops stationed and passing through, and the barracks are limited, most are stationed in factories and schools, affecting the start of factory operations and school openings. The Garrison Command is paying close attention to this and has ordered unnecessary troops to leave Shanghai separately. Stationed troops are being moved out of factories and schools as much as possible and relocated to the suburbs, choosing ancestral halls, temples, and public places to station troops. When necessary, tents will be built in the suburbs to minimize contact with civilians and rectify military discipline. In the past, due to the large number of troops passing through, such as those passing through Shanghai to Taiwan, Zhejiang, and Fujian, as well as those retreating from Northeast and North China to Shanghai, the numbers were too large and the composition was complex. A small number of soldiers invaded civilian houses, inevitably causing disturbances to the people. After strict rectification by the Garrison Command, such phenomena are expected to decrease in the future. The biggest problem for the troops now is that the treatment is too poor and the nutrition is inadequate, which greatly affects morale. According to the reporter's investigation, the current treatment of the National Army is as follows:</p>
<p>Private 300 yuan</p>
<p>Private First Class 338 yuan</p>
<p>Corporal 450 yuan</p>
<p>Sergeant 600 yuan</p>
<p>Staff Sergeant 750 yuan</p>
<p>Sergeant First Class 1,050 yuan</p>
<p>Warrant Officer 4,560 yuan</p>
<p>Second Lieutenant 5,190 yuan</p>
<p>First Lieutenant 6,150 yuan</p>
<p>Captain 7,800 yuan</p>
<p>Major 9,600 yuan</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel 12,450 yuan</p>
<p>Colonel 14,100 yuan</p>
<p>Brigadier General 15,600 yuan</p>
<p>Major General 17,100 yuan</p>
<p>General 19,000 yuan</p>
<p>Looking at the above salary table, a private's 300 yuan per month can only buy fifteen pancakes now, and a general's 19,000 yuan is only enough to buy a dan (approx. 100 lbs) of rice. This is the treatment of the National Army! The food allowance (vegetable money) is 1,200 yuan per person per month for officers and soldiers, which is only 40 yuan per person per day. When purchasing soldiers go to the vegetable market to buy food, because the prices are too far from the market prices, they have to force vegetable vendors to buy at the so-called "official price". Vegetable vendors suffer too much loss, inevitably causing complaints. This is also one of the reasons why the military and civilians cannot cooperate. If the vegetable money in the troops is not enough, or if more vegetables are needed, it is necessary to supplement it with the staple food of military rice. According to the regulations of the Ministry of National Defense, each person's daily rice ration is 25 taels (approx. 31 oz), which is probably not finished, and the remaining rice is sold to slightly subsidize the vegetable money. The Ministry of National Defense is also very concerned about this and will improve it. It is recently heard that they are planning to distribute goods in kind, but there are still many technical problems in implementation.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Xiguan, a worker at Yonggu Paint Company and resident of No. 7, Lane 579, Changshou Road, i.e., Sanyuanfang Lane, from Taixing, accidentally started a fire around 12:35 pm yesterday while using a stove.

After the fire broke out, the Shanghai West District Private Fire Relief Association, Fahua District, Caojiadu, Zhenru District, Huashan Road, and Yichang Road Fire Districts dispatched seven or eight pump trucks. Despite their best efforts, the fire was too strong and the houses were old. The fire was not brought under control until 3:45 pm. It is estimated that more than forty houses were destroyed, and the affected residents were generally displaced, which was a tragic sight. Fortunately, it was during the day, and there were no deaths or injuries.

<h3>Public Utility Pricing in Customs Gold Units Causes Dissatisfaction Among All Sectors in the City; Passenger Traffic on Public Buses and Trams Declines, Business Slack</h3>
<p>After the authorities approved the pricing of public utilities in Customs Gold Units, public transportation vehicles in the city began to implement it yesterday. Unit prices were posted in the vehicles, with the highest price increase reaching over 150% compared to the original fare. The price will be freely adjusted at any time according to the exchange rate in the future. This is truly a landmark miracle in public transportation ticketing. Because the fare has been changed to the Customs Gold Unit, the general public is afraid to take it, resulting in a sharp decline in passenger traffic on all public bus and tram lines in the city yesterday, and business is very slack. All sectors of the city have expressed indignation at the pricing method of public utilities in Customs Gold Units. It is also learned that the monthly and seasonal ticket prices for public buses and trams in the city sold by the Public Transportation Company are 10,000 yuan per month for ordinary public buses and 5,000 yuan for public school teachers, and 8,000 yuan per month for trams and 4,000 yuan for public school teachers, which are provisional. It was originally planned to adjust it every half month, but it was not approved by the municipal authorities. The sale price of monthly and seasonal tickets for March will not be changed.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Yesterday, the ticket prices for public buses and trams were officially calculated based on the Customs Gold Unit base (unit) price converted to gold yuan coupons. Tram first class is divided into 70 yuan, 100 yuan, 120 yuan, 150 yuan, and 170 yuan, five types. Third class is divided into 70 yuan, 80 yuan, 100 yuan, and 110 yuan, four types. Public buses are divided into 80 yuan, 110 yuan, 160 yuan, 180 yuan, 200 yuan, and 230 yuan, six types. Subsequently, the various ticket prices will be adjusted at any time by the Public Utility Bureau according to the fluctuation of the unit price.</p>
<h3>Taking a Prostitute on a Tour with Sinister Motives; Dining in a Restaurant Leads to Deception of Silver Dollars, Scalper Heavily Fooled</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A prostitute named Cen Yuzhen (25 years old) from Guangdong Province in a brothel at No. 4, Love Block, Lane 135, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei District, was led in by a pimp on the evening of the 1st of this month. The client wore a black woolen Zhongshan suit and a gray tweed overcoat, was about 30 years old, and had an elegant demeanor. He was entertained by Cen Yuzhen, a Cantonese prostitute, and paid 3,500 yuan for the night. The two spent a pleasant night together. The client claimed to have just arrived from Chengdu and was unfamiliar with the area, so he strongly invited the prostitute to accompany him on a tour. Cen agreed. The next morning at 8:30 am, after getting up, they hired a car from Donghua Motor Company, driven by driver Hua Junyue, and went on a tour. They visited parks such as Zhongshan and Fuxing. Around 12:00 noon, the client asked Cen if she had any other girlfriends to join them for lunch. Cen, without thinking, ordered the driver to drive to No. 9, Lane 59, Yangjiabang, Qimei Road, to call her close friend Yang Feifei to come out and join them. The client first ordered the driver to drive to the entrance of the International Hotel, went upstairs alone, and came out more than ten minutes later. They got into the car and drove to Meilongzhen Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road for lunch. He invited the driver to sit down, ordered dishes and wine, and was in high spirits. After the meal, the waiter brought the bill, which cost 19,000 gold yuan. The client calmly claimed that he would take Cen to a nearby place to buy some small items and then return, and told Yang to wait. Yang did not suspect anything and allowed him to leave. The client took Cen by car to two jewelry stores on Nanjing Road, trying to swindle gold rings but failed. He then ordered the driver to drive to Huashan Road in western Shanghai, where he selected thirty large and small head silver dollars from silver dollar vendors, falsely claiming that he had no cash on hand. He ordered the vendors Shi Jinyuan and Sa Pinggeng to get into the car and drove straight to a certain lane entrance on Beihai Road. He ordered the car to stop and pointed to Cen, saying to Shi and others: "This is my wife, please wait a moment while I go inside to get the money." Shi and others trusted him, but after a long time they did not see him come out and realized they had been deceived. They questioned Cen, who explained that she was a prostitute and this man was a client. At this point, the driver Hua Junyue was also shocked. They quarreled with each other and went to the police station with the silver dollar vendors to report the incident. Afterwards, it was learned that Yang Feifei had waited for Cen and others for a long time at Meilongzhen, and had no choice but to pawn her coat to return home, where her husband (a postman from the Telecommunications Bureau) redeemed it with money. Yang, in her resentment, could only lament her misfortune.</p>
<h3>Partial Telephone Obstructions in Kubei District Being Repaired</h3>

<h3>Merchant Ship Misreported as Detained Passing Through Jiangyin; Shipping Association Requests Simplified Inspection Procedures</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the 1st of this month, twelve passenger ships of various private shipping companies that successively sailed from Shanghai to Hankou were supposed to be inspected by the fortress headquarters when passing through Jiangyin. However, because the inspection took a long time, it was mistakenly reported by various parties in the city that they had been detained. The relevant parties yesterday specifically and solemnly denied this. According to the authorities, with the importance of Jiang defense, ships traveling to and from the Yangtze River must be inspected in detail to ensure safety. As for the suspension of navigation between Shanghai and Hankou, no announcement or regulation has been heard from any party, so it proves to be absolutely inaccurate. It is learned that of the twelve passenger ships, the "Longda" and "Jiangchang" belonging to Deda and Datong Companies have already left Cheng yesterday. The remaining "Yifeng," "Anyu," "Minjiang," "Fujiang," "Fenglong," "Lixing," "Qingchang," "Zhongqiang," and two tugboats are still under inspection and will be able to depart in the next few days. The Shipping Association has submitted a request to the authorities, requesting that the inspection procedures for inland waterway ships and imported ships be simplified in the future to facilitate travel.</p>
<h3>Twenty Years of Ups and Downs in the Silver Screen, Selling Youth and Health; Yan Yue Sadly Talks About the Past, Drug Addiction All for Filming</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The old film star "Black Rose" Yan Yuexian, who has starred in 50 films, lives with her father Yan Gongshang and her siblings after being released from prison. After a long period of quiet, she wants to dedicate herself to the silver screen again.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited her residence yesterday, Yan Yuexian talked about the past with a great sense of reluctance. She has been imprisoned three times for smoking opium, which is quite despised by people, who believe that she has voluntarily degenerated. However, according to her own account of the process of drug addiction, there is another sad story, which can reflect the pain of ordinary film practitioners.</p>
<p>She said that she started filming at the age of twelve. Because she often worked all night and the weather was unpredictable, her body deteriorated day by day. In the film "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple," she played the role of a female knight. In order to shoot the scene of flying on the roof, she wore a heavy and tight steel wire corset and jumped and ran at a high altitude, which planted the root of heart failure. In the film "Three Fathers," she co-starred with Wang Xianzai and Gong Jianong, and she played the role of the wife. In the play, Gong was executed by shooting, and she rushed over with her child, knelt in the snow, and mourned over the corpse, which froze her leg and often ached.</p>
<p>At that time, the lives of film practitioners were mostly corrupt. Dressing rooms were often equipped with several sets of smoking equipment, and many actors smoked opium, such as Wang Xianzai and Wang Cilong, who later died of drug addiction. Because her heart was weak and developed into asthma, she began to use opium to treat it at the persuasion of others, and slowly became addicted.</p>
<p>After the first imprisonment, it was followed by a second and third. She explained that it was because the asthma relapsed and she smoked again. Until now, she says that her heart is still very weak, although she no longer smokes opium.</p>
<p>Yan Yuexian certainly no longer has a smoker's face. She is thirty-two years old this year. Although she has gone through three prison lives, she is still very optimistic and cheerful. She said that she hopes to co-star in a film with the old stars from the past, but after more than ten years of ups and downs, this hope is probably not easy to realize.</p>
<p>Yan Yuexian's father, Yan Gongshang, is a veteran of the film industry and has filmed a full hundred films. He is seventy-six years old this year. Since the spring of last year, he has suffered from hemiplegia and paralysis, and the family relies on his two sons to maintain it. Although they are still doing well, they are very poor. The reporter took a photo of him, and he sighed: "What film actors sell is youth and health. This photo is probably my last one."</p>

<h3>The Murderer of the Corpse in a Box Must Be More Than One Person; Autopsy Finds Woman's Underpants, Police Station to Participate in the Investigation Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The railway police have been working hard on the train corpse in a box case for the past two days, and have successively discovered many valuable clues. The investigating detectives are now trying to connect the various clues to form a "hypothetical fact," and then conduct the investigation along this "hypothesis." As for the suspicious man found in Kunshan, it is only known that he was interrogated once. The railway authorities have refused to disclose anything else.</p>
<p>The "corpse in a box" was examined by Prosecutor Ding Tongjun of the District Prosecutor's Office at the mortuary on Changde Road at 2:00 pm yesterday. The examination revealed that there were rope marks on the skull and neck of the corpse, the skull was shattered, and there were five large and small knife marks on the upper and lower left eyes. This proves that the deceased had a fierce fight with the murderer at the time of the murder, and it is known that the murderer must not be alone. In addition to the military blanket, women's coat, newspaper, and other items published in this newspaper yesterday, a white woman's pair of underwear stained with blood was also found during the autopsy. All the evidence and the suitcase were returned to the two railway police departments for research after the autopsy. The investigating police will take the two suitcases containing the corpse parts to a certain station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway today to have the luggage handlers at the station identify them, because after the case occurred, the police department sent telegrams to each station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, informing them of the style of the two suitcases containing the corpse parts, in order to first find out the origin of the "corpse in a box". It is heard that a luggage handler at a certain station claimed that he had carried these two suitcases for passengers on the first of the month. If this point can be confirmed, it will be a big step towards solving the case.</p>
<p>The city police station is also paying close attention to this case. They sent personnel to participate in the work during yesterday's autopsy. The railway bureau also believes that although the case was first discovered on the train, the location of the murder and the hiding place of the murderer may not be near the station or along the railway line. The authority of the railway police is limited to the station and along the two railway lines. Therefore, starting today, the railway bureau will conduct an investigation together with the city police station.</p>

<h3>The Cradle of Jiangsu Soldiers: Military Cadre Class</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter He Xianglin</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 28th dispatch] Xinfeng—located southeast of Zhenjiang, 45 li from Zhenjiang, was not highly valued in people's eyes in the past. Who knew that this poor and remote Xinfeng town has become the cradle of military cadres in Jiangsu, constantly creating batches of new forces for the country.</p>
<p>Recently, at the invitation of Sha Yongxiang, section chief of the Second Section of the Provincial Government,</p>
<p>the reporter sped towards Xinfeng Town in a jeep, taking 50 minutes, and arrived at the headquarters of the Military Cadre Class of the Provincial Training Corps. From this moment on, the sound of gunfire filled my ears, and I breathed the tense atmosphere of the military camp. After Section Chief Sha introduced me to Dong Jitao, the chief captain of the class, who was from Shandong with a square face, large ears, and a plump figure, full of a kind expression, we exchanged pleasantries; then he led the deputy captain Zhou Shiyu and deputy chief captain Song Jingming to accompany the reporter to the parade ground for a visit.</p>
<p>First, we watched the attack of the infantry company of their second student battalion,</p>
<p>launching an assault formation in close combat with live ammunition, artillery fire, and machine guns firing like a string of pearls, the sound of hand grenades exploding, the performance was so realistic that it looked like a battle map, making the reporter feel an irresistible urge to abandon the pen and join the army. The entire exercise lasted for more than half an hour. Chief Captain Dong also explained that when our students studying in Japan reached the last step of the assault formation in close combat, the Japanese instructors would no longer teach us Chinese, which resulted in us suffering losses during the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Afterward, we continued to visit the internal affairs of the First and Second Squads of the Second Company of the school, and the First Squad of the First Company. These team sites were originally ancestral halls and temples, which, after slight renovations,</p>
<p>were militarized. They slept on the floor, the white sheets were folded very neatly, and the arrangement of various items was also in good order. The Fifth Company, Second and Third Squads, etc., were completely in combat readiness internal affairs, the sheets were wrapped into small rolls, and the guns were equipped with bayonets. In addition, there were educational facilities such as outdoor sand tables and literacy sand tables.</p>
<p>According to Deputy Captain Zhou, there are now</p>
<p>more than 2,000 people in this class. The first student class of more than 1,000 people started in December last year, and they will graduate in three months. There are only more than 20 days left. The second student class has already started reporting, with more than 1,000 people. The students mainly come from the platoon leaders of the security regiments of various counties and the provincial security regiment, and the exiled students who were recruited. They are all between 20 and 30 years old. The officer class has already graduated two terms, graduating in four weeks. The third term has now started reporting. Their sources are mainly officers from the security regiments of various counties and the provincial security regiment, and officers who have volunteered to join. The students are now divided into four battalions, one battalion with four companies, one company with three squads, one squad with three classes, and one class with thirteen people, totaling about 2,000 people. The officer class is divided into one battalion with three companies, totaling about 500 people.</p>
<p>The entire military cadre class occupies an area of four or five li, surrounded by mountains and water, which is naturally a good place to train and cultivate the mind and body. Their usual life is: get up at 6:00 in the morning, raise the flag at 6:30, do morning exercises, 7:00 go to field exercises, 9:00 breakfast, 9:30 go to the lecture hall, 2:00 in the afternoon go to exercises again, 4:00 dinner, life is very tense.</p>
<p>Instructor Ma Yanping told the reporter: Because the life of the team is not up to military standards and does not meet military requirements, causing people to hate it, Chairman Ding established the military cadre class, focusing on life training, to be impeccable and welcomed by the people, to achieve our goal. The training methods are divided into three types: life, discipline, and technology. Our slogans are: (1) Integration of war and teaching, the lecture hall is the training ground, and the training ground is the battlefield, (2) Consistency of learning and doing, not talking about appearances, not focusing on formality, learning and doing, cultivating a spirit of hard work and endurance, (3) Never abandon, never indulge, work hard and do practical work, such as repairing roads and planting vegetable gardens, are our active manifestations. We usually often</p>
<p>hold small group discussions, and the center of the discussion is life discipline, giving full freedom to express opinions. In terms of recreational activities, there are basketball, football, volleyball, and tennis. A party is also held once a week, with Peking opera, singing, comedy, juggling, etc. "Xinfeng Weekly" is the military culture of this class, which publishes articles about military life, military activities, etc. In short, we want to achieve sincere cooperation and love between the military and the people.</p>
<p>After three or four hours of observation, with so much material gained, the reporter felt very satisfied. If soldiers all have such a simple spirit, who says China will not be prosperous and happy? I sincerely pray that—the cradle of Jiangsu soldiers—the military cadre class—can be carried forward.</p>

<h3>For the Locality, for the People, for the Next Generation: Promoting the Basic Education Demonstration Zone, Jiangsu Provincial Director of Education Hong Junpei Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Zhu Xianggao</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Yixing, 1st dispatch] Hong Junpei, the current Director of Education of Jiangsu Province, went to Wuxi to inspect social education undertakings and resolve the problem of the principal of the provincial agricultural and forestry vocational school in this county. He came to the county on the 21st of last month, just in time for the opening of the seventh session of the first county council of this county. Therefore, on that day, he invited all the county councilors to the auditorium of the county high school and delivered a speech on "The Importance of Promoting the Basic Education Demonstration Zone in the Current Society," repeatedly reminding the councilors of their own responsibilities, leading the education staff of this county to stick to their posts and overcome the current difficult situation, emphasizing the guidance of agriculture, increasing production, assisting in promoting the development of the basic education demonstration zone, and promoting this county to embark on a bright and prosperous path of happiness. The reporter was fortunate enough to be listed in the records of the meeting, and now</p>
<p>the full text of the speech is recorded for reference or learning:</p>
<p>Regarding basic education, there are two points that must be explained first: (1) All of you present are representatives of the people. The suffering of the people depends on you gentlemen to convey to the government in order to seek improvement. Now the suffering of the people has reached its extreme. In order to solve the suffering of the people, the government must first fully understand the true situation of the people. Otherwise, talking on paper will only be scratching an itch. These are the important responsibilities on your shoulders today. The council is a bridge between the government and the people. To urge the government to relieve the suffering of the people and implement good governance, the council must first seek to cooperate with the government in order to exert its effect. Not only must the council itself be united, but it is also extremely important to cooperate with the government sincerely to exert strength, then the happiness of the people will come naturally.</p>
<p>(2) The situation is turbulent, and people's hearts are extremely uneasy, which often leads to social unrest. This situation is inevitable in the transitional period. Safety and danger are often in a flash of thought, leading to great mistakes. Therefore, today is truly the most difficult period. You should usually inform the people in the countryside to recognize the times, lead the people, maintain calmness, and stick to their posts, and not be shaken by external resistance, then social order can be stabilized. It is like a lonely boat in the wind and rain, and the future fate is already on the edge of misfortune and blessing. It only depends on the fellow travelers to work together with one heart and mind. The more calm, the more we can find a solution and overcome the difficulties. The more the environment and trend are treacherous, the more we must do things according to the normal track, and be calm in the face of difficulties. I believe that to stabilize social order, it is necessary to be calm, and it is especially important to</p>
<p>have a leader who knows how to get people to take responsibility, which lies on the shoulders of the councilors and education personnel in the local area. It is not denied that Jiangsu is the first in national education, and Yixing is the first in Jiangsu education. The culture and education of this county have always been known for their development and have a normal track to follow. However, in this extraordinary period, due to various human reasons, there are inevitably situations that deviate from the ideal. I hope that you will fully assist in order to bring it back to the right track. In other words, the harassment of the current society is the responsibility of the past education personnel. The fundamental problem is that they have completely failed in their own business. If education can be successfully carried out, there will never be a chaotic and uneasy phenomenon again. Our modern responsibility is to lay the groundwork for the next generation. The success or failure of today's education not only affects the current society, but also sows the seeds for the next generation. Therefore, I hope that you can assist education personnel in persuading the people to be calm, stabilize social order, and safely overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<p>I also want to ask you (2)</p>
<p>for two favors (1) I hope that you will advocate that the people increase agricultural production in the countryside. The biggest reason for the current social unrest is "poverty." There is a shortage of materials and society is not sufficiently distributed. If you want to increase materials, it will not be effective unless you first increase production. One of the prerequisites for stabilizing society is that, for example, Yixing has more than 1.29 million acres of cultivated land. If each acre of land can increase the yield of grain by 50 to 100 catties, it can increase production by about 600,000 dan to 1 million dan. In fact, it is not difficult to increase these numbers per acre. In addition, increasing by-products will greatly increase wealth, and the people will be greatly enriched, and society will have no reason to seek social stability. Increasing production is a fundamental problem, and it is urgent to rely on you to advocate and encourage it so that this undertaking can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>(2) In the past, Chinese education followed the saying "He who excels in learning will become an official," and it became an education for cultivating a few people, not for reading for life. At this stage, education has lost its original meaning and has completely deteriorated. The slow evolution of society is because human rights cannot be equal. To seek equality of human rights, we must start with education. Equality of knowledge means that the majority of people will not be controlled by the minority. The progress of the minority cannot be called the progress of society. Basic education is not only to make people literate, but also to guide people on how to be a person, how to produce, how to live, and how to be a modern citizen. In other words, it is to instruct human beings on how to survive, and to integrate the entire education with the principles of being a person, with politics, with production, with citizenship, and with life. If basic education can be successfully promoted, we will have entered a new environment of prosperity and happiness. To promote this work, it is necessary to seek sufficient funds. At this time when the county's finances are particularly exhausted, of course, the burden on the people cannot be increased. If the importance of this work is mentioned, it cannot be called huge. Fortunately, it is taken from the locality and used for the locality. In addition, I also request the US Aid Rural Rehabilitation Committee to allocate</p>
<p>a part of the economy to be used for basic education, which is actually enriching local finances. If the situation does not deteriorate excessively in the future, the central government and the province will provide subsidies for the promotion of this program. The implementation of this work requires a large amount of manpower. I will recruit anyone who has some experience in basic education. I hope that you will widely recommend a vast and difficult future. I hope that you will work together to promote the basic education demonstration zone for the locality, for the people, and for the next generation, so that it can be successful. This is a task that I sincerely pray for.</p>
<h3>Spring Returns to Longshang</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 28th aviation dispatch] The earth returns to spring, quiet and lacking vitality. However, when the reporter visited Qinghai two weeks ago, on a clear day after a fresh snowfall, I climbed the Angben Monastery, where the Tenth Panchen Lama was stationed. On the lawn in front of the monastery, I found a piece of strong reproductive vitality. The Malan grass had already sprouted thick young shoots from the muddy soil on the snow. I couldn't help but feel excited. When I drove back across the vast Kukunor grassland, a tender yellow tone was rippling from the tree branches and the tips of the grass. The spring god had quietly descended on the Northwest.</p>
<p>Today's Lanzhou, thanks to the activity of General Zhang Zhizhong, and the gathering and consultation of the military and political leaders of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces, has truly become the nerve center of the Northwest. The young Mayor of Lanzhou, Sun Runan, said that it was the first time that the military and political leaders of the Northwest had gathered in Lanzhou so neatly. It is a pity that Lanzhou itself is not up to par, with frequent power outages and inconvenient water supply, and he was very sorry.</p>
<p>Unity, Stability, Progress, Survival</p>
<p>With Chief Zhang Zhizhong as the center, the dignitaries held more than a dozen symposiums and countless private exchanges of views, and finally decided on the recent future direction of the Northwest: "Seeking stability from unity, seeking progress from stability," and "Seeking survival from progress." General Zhang Zhizhong, who had been working hard for peace for several months, stole a few days of leisure, lived alone in Xinglong Mountain, more than 50 kilometers from Lanzhou, and thought deeply about the overall situation and considered the Northwest decision-making. As a result, some people inevitably held over-sensitive speculations about Zhang's actions, but now they have been shattered by the facts. Zhang repeatedly emphasized when he returned to Lanzhou: "Seeking peace requires reason and calmness." If the decision of war or peace is not yet made, and we first create chaos and make a mess, isn't that asking for our own destruction?</p>
<p>Overture to the Song of Spring's Return Composed</p>
<p>No matter how harsh the spring cold is, or how the situation changes, the authorities of the Northwest provinces have composed the "overture" for the "reason for the return of spring." Only unity, unity, and unity can smoothly unfold the work of stabilizing the Northwest. Under the subject of stability, the first answer is to save the Northwest economy, which is about to collapse. Under the leadership of the Northwest military and political officials, the Economic Commission announced its establishment on the 9th, followed by the appointment of many experts and scholars to divide into financial, financial, land, and price groups to study the current serious problems and then make thorough strengthening and improvement measures.</p>
<p>Rising Prices, Nostalgia for Ingots</p>
<p>According to the recent statistics of the municipal government, the prices in Lanzhou have risen sharply, and the monthly salary of public and education personnel is only worth one or two silver dollars. Everyone believes that, in the final analysis, the gold yuan coupons have harmed people, and they cannot help but feel nostalgic for ingots (Northwesterners call silver coins ingots). As early as half a year ago, the Gansu Provincial Government and the Provincial Council had repeatedly requested the central government to restore the Gansu Mint. Zhu Jing was approved, and after the provinces brewed and issued local currencies, the Gansu Provincial Government brought up the old matter again, and finally received approval from the central government to prepare to restore the minting of silver coins. The authorities sent people to inspect the machinery of the former mint. The main tool, the rolling machine, was missing. Whether the provincial government has decided to resume minting is subject to deep consideration based on the machine's own capabilities.</p>
<p>Northwest Regional Economic Unit</p>
<p>Before the concrete plan for reforming the Northwest economy is produced and announced, the government will implement several emergency measures to stabilize the currency value and eliminate the rising trend. According to the reporter, there are prohibitions on the export of silver coins, and the prices of gold, silver, and silver coins will be determined by the Central Bank's daily listing. As for the plan to solve the entire Northwest economic problem, it is said that a complete plan has been made for the Northwest's financial system, financial revenue and expenditure, and currency use, with the focus on forming a Northwest regional economic unit, which can not only stabilize people's livelihood, but also help production.</p>
<h3>Giant Prison Break Case in Changzhou: Major Criminals Fei Guoxiang and Others Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Wujin, 2nd dispatch] After the giant prison break case in Changzhou occurred, the warden Huang Weihan, the guard director Guo Lufu, and the five guards Wang Qinghui, Cao Jijing, and Wu Enze were first detained by the city defense department and sent to the police station for interrogation. It was discovered that there were many suspicious points and twists and turns, which were not convenient to publish for a while. The police station has sent the confessions of each person to the city defense department for verification, and at the same time ordered its subordinates to step up the arrest of prison breakers and the prisoners who were broken out of prison, including: Fei Guoxiang, 25 years old, from Wuxing, Zhejiang, worked in Baojialong, Shengze Town, Wujiang, with a square face and fair skin. Ni Defang, from Hutangqiao, Wujin, had committed theft. Huang Ming, 28 years old, from Tianyue, Second District, Jintan, with a small round face. Wu Jian, 30 years old, from Xipu Township, Fourth District, Danyang, with a small pointed face. Sun Xiaohai, 25 years old, from Lizhuangqiao, Danyang. Ye Caitang, 32 years old, from Cuibqiao, Henglin, a opium addict. Le Fang, 36 years old, from Guangdong. Committed the crime of treason. Chen Pinzhang, 22 years old, a opium addict. Cao Liqing, 43 years old, No. 1, Tongyi Lane, Zhongren Road, Wuxi, a repeat offender sentenced to three years and six months, with nearsightedness. Also, Cao Liqing had compiled a bail application, which was sent to the district court by someone one day after the incident. The clerk Feng of the court's dispatch department received it as usual, and was later severely reprimanded by President Zhang. There is also an episode about Cao Xianqing, who and Jiang Shixiao both committed tax evasion and corruption. Currently, Jiang Shixiao is still in custody. Zeng Yu came out and jointly contributed to the public appeal column of the Wuxian Subao, the voice of the people. The original text roughly stated that Yang Anren, the protagonist of the Jin Chao case, and Zhang Hongtu, the protagonist of the corruption in the two-way bureau, etc., had been freed, and the small corruption officials were still in the cage. Please ask the authorities to follow the example and approve bail. The readers felt both funny and absurd.</p>
<h3>Impression of Minggang</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Fang Canglang</p>
<p>After a discussion, the reporter group decided to get off the train to visit. Unexpectedly, after the train stopped, the sound of firecrackers on the platform was deafening. In the line of people from all walks of life welcoming them, there were many elders with white hair and beards. Mr. Li Jiexiang, an old man of 71 years old in the town, also stood respectfully in the line, smiling to greet them. Such a scene and such a sight made all the colleagues feel extremely ashamed. However, because of the warm invitation, they could not bypass the platform and escape. They had to cup their fists, salute, bow, and wave their hands to return the salute while walking quickly. After entering Minggang Village, the sound of firecrackers on the street was rising and falling one after another, resounding throughout the village. When they arrived at a certain military division headquarters, they met the local elders. They asked for advice one by one and thanked and apologized repeatedly. Then the reporter and his colleagues could not help but smile embarrassedly at each other.</p>
<p>We had dinner with the local elders in the division headquarters. After dinner, we held a symposium and listened to some touching stories of military-civilian cooperation, and listened to some valuable opinions from the elders. They talked about the activities of the local communists in Tianmu Mountain, east of Minggang, and the local communists in Tongbai Mountain on the railway</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xinyang, 26th aviation dispatch] The importance of the defense of Zhumadian is as mentioned above. In order to reduce the hard work of the garrison in receiving and protecting us, the reporter group said goodbye to all circles at 3:30 pm on the same day and returned to Xinyang in the original car. At 4:50, the car passed Minggang. Because the military had already called in the morning, it was learned that the elders of Minggang were eager to give the threat to the west, but very trusted in the military power of General Li Benyi to stabilize the surrounding areas, and praised the military discipline of Li's military division. Minggang belongs to Xinyang, about 90 li from the town, and about 85 li from Zhengyang in the east. The entire town has a population of more than 20,000, and its main products are grain, pigs, soybean oil, sorghum wine, and cow and sheep skins. The folk customs are very simple. On the first day after the Lunar New Year, Ma Lou and other places in the fifth pao of the town had conflicts with the local team from Biyang, which came south from the north, due to misunderstandings between the military and the people. More than a dozen villages were burned down, and more than 30 villagers were killed.</p>
<p>After the incident, according to the official, these teams without clothes and food were indeed pitiful and terrible. They are now starting to rectify them, but the villagers in Minggang who were victimized are already dead and cannot be resurrected. We hope that the authorities will quickly eliminate these bad teams and stop harming people. When we left Minggang, everyone was filled with a sense of guilt and said goodbye to the elders and all circles in the town, and returned to Xinyang at 9 pm that night.</p>
<h3>Southwest Transportation Artery: Reviving the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Project</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>[Chengdu Report from Our Newspaper, 26th] Amidst the raging war and forced endurance of the New Year, the people of Sichuan and Chongqing recently received an unexpected piece of encouraging news: the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, a major artery of transportation in the Southwest, has been revived by order of the central government. Funding has been included in the national budget, and the construction of the light rail section within Chongqing is being expedited, with a deadline for completion within the year. As the only railway serving as the backbone of Sichuan's transportation, it has been plagued for nearly forty years, with ups and downs, frequent stops and starts in construction. Today, there is optimism about its eventual completion, with a bright future in sight, which brings immense warmth and comfort to the people of Sichuan who have endured a decade of war.</p>
<p>Full Project Filled with Hardship</p>
<p>The history of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project represents the vicissitudes of forty years of Sichuan's prosperity and decline. Before the change of government, when the railway was first proposed, more than 27 million yuan was raised. When nationalization was proposed, the people of Sichuan shed blood and risked their lives to protect their transportation sovereignty, which led to the Xinhai Revolution. Since the founding of the Republic, warlords fought for power, with over 380 large and small civil wars, and the railway funds were completely divided up, causing the entire project to come to a standstill. In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], when Sichuan's situation had somewhat stabilized, the central government initiated a construction plan and signed a contract with a French banking group to form the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to manage the project. However, shortly after construction began, the War of Resistance broke out, and materials could not be transported inland, causing the project to suffer another setback. After the victory and restoration, the National Government, to reward Sichuan for its special contributions during the War of Resistance, instructed the Ministry to revise the plan to complete the entire railway within two years. However, due to the depleted national treasury and insufficient funding, the construction work was intermittent. This only railway, the transportation heart of the Land of Abundance, has faced twists and turns and numerous hardships from its initial proposal to its construction, spanning forty years. This time, the central government's early implementation of the three-year completion plan for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project will undoubtedly usher in a new era for transportation in the Southwest.</p>
<p>Expedited Construction with a Deadline</p>
<p>According to the plan for expedited construction with funds allocated by the Executive Yuan, the following four points have been approved by the Yuan's meeting: (1) 10.06 million gold yuan has been allocated as an advance for the second half of the 37th year [1948]. (2) 30 million gold yuan for transportation and miscellaneous expenses will be allocated as planned. (3) An initial three months' worth of construction funds at 20 million gold yuan per month will be allocated first. (4) The Central Bank will allocate at least one million US dollars out of the four million US dollars in foreign exchange needed for the first year's plan. According to the Ministry of Transportation's plan, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway will serve as a major trunk line connecting the Northwest and Southwest railways. Currently, the roadbed of the 283-kilometer section from Chongqing to Neijiang is mostly completed and is almost ready for track laying. To facilitate early traffic, light rails that can be manufactured by Chongqing's steel mills and materials that can be supplied by Sichuan Province will be used for temporary operation on the Chongqing section. At the same time, foreign materials will be actively procured, and upon arrival, they will be replaced gradually. The dismantled light rails will be moved forward step by step and eventually used to lay branch lines along the entire route. In the early stages of this light railway's operation, the daily transportation volume can reach 800 tons, greatly alleviating the current transportation difficulties in Sichuan Province. This is undoubtedly good news for the people of Sichuan, who have been suffering from prolonged warfare, and will promote peaceful construction.</p>
<p>One-Year Light Rail Plan for Chongqing Section</p>
<p>The one-year plan for the Chongqing section light rail construction, which has already commenced, includes: (1) Temporarily modifying the route to lay light rails, with a length of 283 kilometers from Chongqing to Neijiang. (2) The route standard, including the roadbed, bridges, culverts, and tunnels, will still be constructed according to the national railway gauge standard. Steel rails will initially be laid using 30-pound light rails for operation. Once foreign heavy rails arrive, they will be replaced immediately, and the removed light rails will be used to lay branch lines. (3) Locomotives, vehicles, and machinery will be allocated from various railways as much as possible, using light locomotives and self-made passenger cars. Steel materials that cannot be supplied domestically will be purchased from abroad as soon as possible. (4) The cost of labor and materials is estimated at 196 million gold yuan, based on January prices, including: 1. Completing the unfinished projects on the Chongqing section; 2. Laying tracks, building bridges, and manufacturing passenger and freight cars; 3. 500,000 sleepers; 4. 10,000 tons of 30-pound light rails; 5. 800 tons of steel bridges; 6. 300 tons of cargo from Shanghai to Chongqing, etc. With the implementation of this plan, Sichuan's first formal railway is expected to be open to traffic within a year, and the 40-year dream of the people of Sichuan will be realized.</p>
<p>Coordinating Engineering and Economic Development</p>
<p>To coordinate with the one-year opening to traffic, the Sichuan Provincial Government is also planning to expand economic construction. Along the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway line, it is actively mobilizing local resources to expedite the construction of branch lines or highways to connect with the main line. For the branch line portion, such as the Chengdu-Leshan, Chengdu-Pengxian, Jing (Zigong)-Nei (Jiang) lines, local people have separately formed companies, raised funds, and started construction. For the highway portion, such as the Zi (Zhong)-Wei (Yuan), Nei (Jiang)-An (Yue) lines, construction has also begun. The aim is to ensure that within a year, Sichuan's special products, such as the sugar from Zizhong and Neijiang, the salt from Zigong, and the coal from Weiyuan, can be transported smoothly through this major transportation artery. According to the transportation plan after the entire line is completed, it is estimated that 1.5 million tons of goods will be transported annually, including 500,000 tons each of rice and coal, and 100,000 tons each of salt, sugar, tung oil, bristles, medicinal materials, hardware, cloth, general merchandise, and other miscellaneous goods. The Provincial Government has also formulated a plan to develop special products to meet the transportation needs, as the central focus of Sichuan's construction plan for this year. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, which is starting a new revival this year, is not only good news for transportation in Sichuan Province but can also be said to have become the driving force for the entire economic construction of Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province's Universal Training Reaches Over 5 Million People</h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang Report from Our Newspaper, 2nd] According to the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command, the work of organizing and training the people in various counties has been universally implemented. This work is based on the "Regulations for Strengthening the Organization and Training of the People in Jiangsu Province," which was formulated with reference to the training regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan and in accordance with the actual situation of Jiangsu Province. It was approved by the 198th meeting of the Provincial Government and issued to various counties for implementation. All people below the Bao level are included in the organization, organized into Bao Zhuang Teams, Youth Teams, Children's Teams, Respect for the Elderly Associations, Women's Associations, etc., and given training for self-defense and self-government. To strengthen the leadership of grassroots cadres, the Provincial Government recently decided to make Bao Chiefs and Bao Team Leaders salaried positions, paid at the 16th level of delegated positions. According to reports from various counties, the number of people undergoing training has reached over 5 million.</p>
<h3>Embracing Qian Politics Reform with a Serious and Complex Mood: Diligent Implementation Makes Self-Reliance Not Difficult</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Guiyang Report from Our Newspaper, 25th] Guizhou has always followed the central government politically and relied on neighboring provinces economically, resulting in various physical and psychological weaknesses. This did not matter during times of national peace, but now that the flames of war are gradually burning closer, it can no longer remain weak and must strive to support itself and find ways to be self-reliant to survive these difficult years.</p>
<p>In December of last year, the Guizhou Provincial Government formulated a plan to adjust the structures of county-level organizations. Not only has this been effective in the province's counties, but neighboring provinces such as Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi have also requested copies of the plan to use as a blueprint for reforming grassroots politics, indicating that administrative structures are not immutable and must be adapted to changing circumstances. Ninety-five percent of the province's expenses rely on central government subsidies. Currently, the national treasury is more depleted than ever before, and transportation between Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Guiyang is more difficult than in any neighboring provincial capital. While comprehensive peace is desired by everyone, if the war continues and everything changes, Guizhou, being a remote and impoverished province, must prepare early. Based on this need, Chairman Gu Zheng-lun instructed the relevant departments to draft a "Guizhou Provincial Political Reform Plan," which, after more than a month and several revisions, was formally approved at today's (25th) Provincial Government Standing Committee meeting and ordered for immediate implementation. This plan aims to</p>
<p>raise the authority of Commissioners and County Magistrates in terms of regulations. The Provincial organs and schools stationed in the counties are authorized to supervise and assess on behalf of the Provincial Government. The chiefs of the Land and Food Administration, Tax Collection Administration, Police Bureau, and Deputy Commander of the People's Defense Corps in each county may be nominated and guaranteed by the County Magistrate. If the heads of various departments in the county government commit serious misconduct, whether they are appointed by the Provincial Government or nominated by the County Magistrate, the County Magistrate is allowed to suspend them first and nominate someone to act as their replacement. To reserve candidates for County Magistrates, it is stipulated that current administrative staff in the county government with outstanding performance may be considered one of the standards for appointing County Magistrates. County Magistrates and heads of various departments are allowed to receive special office expenses, with County Magistrates receiving the same as Provincial Government committee members and heads of departments receiving the same as Provincial Government section chiefs. They will be adjusted along with Provincial-level personnel and will not receive separate allowances for integrity or integrity grain, in order to save local finances.</p>
<p>In terms of laws and regulations, the plan strives for simplification and ease of implementation. It is stipulated that all laws and regulations should be flexible. If they do not conform to the actual situation in the respective counties, the counties are allowed to draft alternative methods and submit them for approval and implementation. If central government laws and regulations are outdated or do not conform to the actual situation in the province, they must be submitted for repeal or amendment. Provincial single-line regulations must be thoroughly reviewed and repealed or merged to achieve clarity. To strengthen</p>
<p>contingency measures, provincial-level organs will implement the principle of joint offices. All matters relating to general affairs, accounting, statistics, personnel, inspection, and supervision will be handled uniformly to reduce expenses and increase efficiency. County-level organs will follow the previously issued "County-Level Organization Adjustment Plan" and will not be allowed to change it rashly. Coordinating with this organizational adjustment, the</p>
<p>personnel decisions are as follows: In the provincial-level part, after the joint office, the total number of provincial government staff (excluding schools) will be retained at two-thirds, and the rest will be dispatched to work in districts and counties to avoid the over-concentration of talent. Staff sent to districts and counties will retain their original salaries and levels. However, those who are unwilling to go will be considered to have resigned. In the county-level part, county government staff must be strictly screened, and those who are incompetent will be dismissed. Vacancies will be filled by staff dispatched from the provincial level. Township and town chiefs will be temporarily suspended from popular election and will be appointed by the county magistrate from qualified candidates. Township and town chief officers and Bao officers will begin training immediately and will be firmly controlled and utilized by the county magistrate. Finance is the</p>
<p>mother of all government affairs. The following regulations apply to provincial-level finances: To achieve the goal of wealth and poverty alleviation, self-defense special taxes should be heavily levied, and excessive profits from commercial and speculative activities may be targeted at wealthy households for special relief taxes when necessary. To ensure fair burden, land survey and equal taxation will be one of the main central tasks this year. Regarding county-level finances, the plan emphasizes the effective consolidation of existing tax revenues, strictly prohibiting local government employees, educators, and senators from contracting to collect taxes, raising the standards for penalties for late payments, and piloting township and town tax collection. The plan also calls for strict implementation of ad valorem taxation, adjusting it at any time to increase tax revenue, and using in-kind collections whenever necessary. Counties may add 10% interest grain to accumulated grain loans to cover storage expenses. The use of apportionment to generate production in townships and towns must be strictly prohibited. Due to the shortage of auxiliary currency in various counties, efforts should be made to negotiate with the Central Bank for transportation. If miscellaneous auxiliary currency or substitutes are issued on their own, their circulation should be strictly prohibited when the Central Bank's auxiliary currency arrives.</p>
<p>The primary central task for Guizhou Province this year is public security. County magistrates' performance in organizing and training the People's Defense Corps will be the basis for their evaluation and retention. The Deputy Commander of the People's Defense Corps should avoid being from the same locality. All general team attachments will be abolished and replaced with training supervisors who will be sent to various townships and towns to oversee training. Training will be conducted using a mobile training approach. People who have already undergone organization and training should be given economic assistance, such as providing salt based on population, prioritizing agricultural loans, and distributing American tobacco seeds. The ideal equipment is "everyone on the roster must have a gun, and everyone with a gun must have ammunition." The main and side food allowances for team members must be merged into the soldier's mess allowance and issued in rice, with the minimum amount sufficient for a soldier's necessary food.</p>
<p>Guizhou's economic development policy emphasizes both agriculture and industry, with agriculture focusing on increasing land production and industry focusing on developing land transportation. Therefore, the focus this year remains on "transportation first" and "production first." To compensate for the leakage of salt and cloth, the province will continue to promote American tobacco, rapeseed, tung oil, and wood oil, but technical guidance should be strengthened to avoid fruitless efforts. The province will reward people for planting trees on public barren mountains. After the trees mature, they will belong to the people, and the public land will also belong to them as a reward. Burning mountains will be strictly prohibited to protect the forests. The construction of county roads should be uniformly designed and technically guided by the Construction Department, and counties should not act independently to avoid repeating the past mistakes of wasting manpower and resources on impractical projects.</p>
<p>Other aspects, such as the strict implementation of the ban on opium, the effort to popularize health, and the determination to reform social customs, are discussed in detail. The general standard is to ensure that all public employees</p>
<p>practice honesty and competence. "Honesty" means that officials are not corrupt, clerks do not harass, and soldiers and police do not act like local bullies. "Competence" means breaking the negative mentality of "seeking no merit but avoiding mistakes."</p>
<p>More than 5,000 people in Guizhou and current employees of the provincial government are facing this new reform plan with serious and complex emotions. If it is diligently implemented, then 11 million people in Guizhou should be able to provide for themselves and the whole territory should be blessed. However, the degree of success will still depend on the extent to which it is implemented.</p>

<h3>Implementation Plan for Land Reform in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Nanchang Report from Our Newspaper, 26th] "Land to the tiller" is a consistent policy of the Kuomintang's implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood and is also one of the central tasks of the Jiangxi Provincial Government this year. Upon taking office, Chairman Fang Tianyi declared that he attached great importance to the issue of land reform and hoped to achieve practical results through rapid methods.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government, with reference to the successful examples of land reform in Guangxi and Zhejiang, has drafted the "Implementation Plan for Land Reform in Jiangxi Province," which will be promulgated and implemented soon. According to Mr. Liu Jiashu, the director of the Provincial Government Information Office, the contents of this plan are divided into four points:</p>
<p>(1) Limiting Private Cultivated Land: It stipulates that the private cultivated land of each household of ten people shall not exceed 50 mu of superior paddy field, 70 mu of medium paddy field, or 100 mu of inferior paddy field. Dry land is doubled in comparison. The cultivated land exceeding this limit shall be sold within six months. If it is not sold after the deadline, it will be requisitioned by the county (city) government and distributed to the original tenant farmers or owner-cultivators. The selling price of the land shall be 70% of the original rent, and the payment shall be made in kind over 14 years starting from the 39th year [1950]. Barren land, ownerless cultivated land, or surplus cultivated land, except for those purchased by the original cultivating farmers, shall be given priority to be purchased by the families of active servicemen. This is the center of the two major policies of "land to the tiller" and "land to the soldiers." The land directly distributed to owner-cultivators by the government shall be priced at five times the original rent and repaid over ten years. Other standards regarding the grading of cultivated land and rent are also specified in detail in the plan.</p>
<p>(2) Supporting Owner-Cultivators: (1) Requisitioning and distributing private cultivated land; (2) Prohibiting non-owner-cultivators from purchasing cultivated land; (3) Providing loans for owner-cultivators; (4) Establishing owner-cultivator farms.</p>
<p>(3) Protecting Tenant Farmers: (1) Registering leases; (2) Limiting rent; (3) Protecting tenancy rights. When landlords take back the land for self-cultivation, they shall notify the tenant farmers one year in advance. When tenant farmers request to withdraw from cultivation, they shall notify the landlord three months in advance.</p>
<p>(4) Strengthening Farmers' Organizations: (1) Farmers' associations at all levels shall complete their organization within two months and assist in handling land reform. (2) Owner-cultivators are absolutely prohibited from participating in farmers' associations as members to prevent the intrusion of local bullies and gentry. If this regulation is violated, the responsible government official in charge shall be severely punished.</p>
<p>The land reform plan drafted by the Provincial Government is not only a plan but also has specific deadlines for implementation and completion. According to the regulations, the following will be carried out: (1) Total registration or general investigation of cultivated land will begin in April of the 38th year [1949] and be completed in October. Surplus cultivated land shall be sold before January of the 39th year [1950]. (2) The work of requisitioning cultivated land and supporting owner-cultivators will begin in March of the 39th year [1950] and be completed in December of the same year. (3) Lease registration shall be completed before February of the 39th year [1950]. (4) The demonstration period for owner-cultivator farms shall be completed within two years.</p>
<p>Chairman Fang has the greatest determination to thoroughly implement Jiangxi's "Land Reform Plan" and is prepared to use the spirit of fighting the enemy to remove obstacles such as local tyrants and bullies encountered in the process of promoting this new policy to complete this major epoch-making reform in history and economy.</p>

<h3>Preparations for Establishing a Public Gold and Silver Market: The National Bank is Still Studying the Matter; One Theory is That it Will Adopt a Government-Supervised, Privately-Operated Model</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] External sources have repeatedly reported that the National Bank authorities, to cooperate with the financial and monetary reform plan, are planning to open a gold and silver market so that the National Bank can, through legitimate channels, observe the market conditions at any time and sell gold and silver to achieve the goal of stabilizing the financial market. However, based on various (two) indications, the National Bank authorities are currently still in the stage of researching and planning this project. As for the organization of a specialized committee to be responsible for selling gold and silver, it is clearly not yet mature. The National Bank authorities are also remaining silent on this matter. However, judging from the fact that the bank's President Liu has repeatedly invited Xu Fusun, a leader in the gold industry, and Wu Pengnian, chairman of the Silversmiths' Association, for discussions, it is clear that the authorities are actively promoting this matter.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Xu Fusun and Wu Pengnian, this time they were invited by the financial authorities purely for consultation purposes. They have no preconceived notions about the authorities' plans to open a gold and silver market, as the decision-making is purely the government's plan, and the authorities only inquired about the number of members in the gold industry and silversmithing industries, their business methods, buying and selling habits, and the standards for the quality of goods. In addition, they were not asked to contribute any opinions on the future gold and silver market.</p>
<p>(Another Report) After the announcement of the new financial and monetary plan, the free trading of gold and silver has been restored. To ensure that gold and silver transactions are on the right track, the authorities are promoting the establishment of a public gold and silver market by gold and silver merchants. Liu Gongyun, president of the National Bank, has repeatedly summoned the persons in charge of the former Gold Industry Association and the Silversmiths' Association to discuss the steps for establishing a public gold and silver market. The new market will operate under a government-supervised, privately-operated model and will engage in transactions. The control measures are currently being drafted by the Ministry of Finance and will be announced soon. The new market is expected to be established before mid-month.</p>
<p>The public gold and silver market has been suspended for several years, and the authorities' sudden decision to plan for its restoration has attracted much attention from all parties. It is widely believed that the authorities' aim is to divert idle funds and reduce the pressure on prices.</p>
<h3>Technical Authorities Consider Improving the Foreign Exchange Purchase Method: May Change to Foreign Currency Deposits; Deposit Certificates Allowed for Free Trading</h3>
<p>Regarding the foreign exchange purchase work, since the Central Bank began posting purchase prices a few days ago based on the financial and monetary reform plan, the purchase work has not been able to proceed smoothly due to the discrepancy between the posted prices and the actual prices. A reporter recently learned from financial authorities that the authorities are considering making technical improvements to this purchase method. However, the purchase principle will not be changed. According to sources at the Central Bank, the technical change may involve changing the current cash purchase to a foreign currency deposit. After handing over the foreign currency to the Central Bank, the bank will issue a deposit certificate similar to a foreign exchange transfer certificate. This deposit certificate will be allowed to be freely traded and used to offset import foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Trade Association Requests Purchase of Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates from Wuzhou Merchants</h3>
<p>It is reported that although Wuzhou has been approved by the Executive Yuan as a foreign trade port, the local National Bank still refuses to purchase foreign exchange transfer certificates held by Wuzhou exporters. The Guangzhou National Bank is also limited to purchasing transfer certificates issued in Guangzhou, leaving Wuzhou exporters with nowhere to sell their transfer certificates. In terms of capital deployment, they are experiencing the pain of suffocation. The International Trade Association here has reported the situation and has transferred the request to the National Bank to order its Wuzhou branch to purchase transfer certificates, and has also telegraphed the Shanghai and Guangzhou branches to purchase them on their behalf. At the same time, it has been decided that the amount obtained from the sale of Wuzhou certificates in Shanghai will be allowed to be remitted to Wuzhou free of charge.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Instructs Procedures for Depositing Cash for Capital Increase by Banks and庄s in Various Regions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding those banks and庄s in various regions that have deposited cash for capital increase, the Ministry of Finance recently notified the National Bank that it can first send personnel to inspect and report to the ministry according to the prescribed procedures. The Ministry of Finance's telegram is as follows: "Upon investigation, for those banks and庄s in various regions that have deposited cash for capital increase in accordance with the regulations, your bank or the bank entrusted with the verification of capital should immediately send personnel to the relevant banks and庄s to check the accounts and verify that the vouchers and stock subscription stubs prove that the increased capital and the revalued assets are genuine. After issuing a guarantee in accordance with the prescribed format, issue a certificate of capital verification and forward the adjustment of capital report submitted by each bank and庄, along with the signatures of the responsible persons and the asset-liability statement, to this ministry for verification, in order to expedite the process. Furthermore, trust companies are a type of bank, and all trust companies that have been approved by this ministry to establish should adjust their capital and deposit cash for capital increase in accordance with the regulations."</p>
<h3>Balance of National Banks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the balance of national banks showed an outflow of 65,334,000 yuan. Foreign banks showed an inflow of 87,563,000 yuan. Banks in the large clearing house showed an inflow of 25,730,000 yuan, while banks in the small clearing house showed an outflow of 36,032,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Gold Control Bureau Decides to Strictly Crack Down On Pricing of Goods in Silver Dollars; Although Silver Dollars are Allowed to Circulate, They are Not Unlimited Legal Tender</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is reported that since the financial and monetary reform plan was announced, a small number of stores in this city have been pricing their goods in silver dollars. A responsible person from the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau told reporters that the government's permission for silver dollars to circulate was originally a measure to stabilize the financial system and facilitate the people, and it does not mean that silver dollars will replace gold yuan as currency. In other words, the gold yuan is still the standard currency with unlimited legal tender status. Although silver dollars can circulate freely, neither creditors nor debtors can force the other party to use them as a means of payment. Therefore, all transactions are still legally made using gold yuan. Merchants pricing in silver dollars not only have the suspicion of forcing customers to use silver dollars as a means of payment, but also hinder the currency system and disrupt the financial system, and should be strictly cracked down on.</p>
<h3>No Profit in Smuggling During Price Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Smuggling Cases at Customs Decrease Significantly</p>
<p>According to news from the Jianghai Customs, smuggling cases in this city have decreased significantly recently, and the quantity has also decreased. Because smugglers have no profit to be made when prices fluctuate greatly, they have stopped their activities. Currently, those seized by customs are mostly single peddlers from Hong Kong to Shanghai, carrying a small number of luxury goods such as nylon stockings and lipstick in their luggage. There are no large-scale smuggled goods.</p>
<h3>Paid-for Goods Licenses: 1,574 Issued</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the Export-Import Control Commission, the value of import goods for which paid-for goods licenses were issued during the week of the 19th to the 26th of last month reached US$6,588,511.84. There were a total of 22 types of goods, and 132 licenses were issued. The value of imported goods was greatest for wool tops, totaling US$1,492,40.56. Second was cigarette paper, totaling US$97,795.31. Third was machinery and parts, totaling US$73,696.84. Pharmaceuticals and medical supplies ranked fourth, totaling US$73,321.12. The most licenses issued were for dyes, totaling 30.</p>
<p>According to statistics, during the 17 weeks from November 1 of last year to February 26 of this year, the association issued a total of 1,574 import licenses for paid-for goods, with a total value of US$11,428,143.18.</p>
<h3>Customs Revenue for Last Month: Totaled 1 Billion Gold Yuan</h3>
<p>Currently, Taxes are Not Yet Assessed in Customs Gold Units</p>
<p>According to Zhang Yongnian, the Jianghai Customs Commissioner, the recent customs revenue has been increasing daily. The total amount of customs duty revenue for last (two) month was 1 billion gold yuan, an increase of 400 million yuan compared to January. The reasons for the increase in tax revenue are (1) the exchange rate of foreign exchange transfer certificates has been increasing from time to time, (2) there has been a slight increase in import and export trade recently.</p>
<p>According to Zhang, in the financial and monetary reform plan, it is stipulated that customs duties will be calculated in customs gold units. The customs has not yet received an order from the Ministry of Finance to implement this. To date, the customs is still collecting customs duties according to the old methods.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Not Numerous</h3>
<p>Since the continuous surge in tea prices, the market yesterday did not rest, but intensified. The main reason is that the supply of both black and green tea is scarce. At the same time, the surge in financial assets, non-market commodities, and public utilities has had a significant impact on costs, thus becoming the main factor driving up prices. By the close of the market, the prices of all grades were rising, but in terms of transactions, although negotiations were heated, the prices offered by both sides were far apart, and only a few deals were concluded.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Stock Market Turned Weak; Taiwan Sugar Saw New Prices Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks stopped rising across the board and turned to decline. The market started strong but ended weak, falling all the way down. The main reasons are that the previous gains were too rapid, credit was still tight, and large institutional investors turned from long to short, stopping their advances and retreating. Yong Yarn initially opened high at 4.30 yuan, and after the opening, the price fluctuated around 2 jiao. At around 11 o'clock, it once rose as high as 4.25 yuan, and the price seemed to be rebounding. But at 11:15, news spread that the Central Bank was selling a large amount of exchange settlement certificates, and sentiment softened again, and the market fell again. The lowest price was below 4 yuan, at 3.93 yuan. Near the close, off-market gold was said to be doing well, and the price was raised to close at 4 yuan. Meiya fell, opening at 1.85 yuan, with a high of 1.87 yuan, a low of 1.68 yuan, and closing at 1.71 yuan. Hetang saw new prices again, trading at 28,520 yuan, its tenth time going up. Among the small-cap stocks, only four hit their daily limit: Xinya Pharmaceutical at 1.24 yuan, Zhenhua Paint at 1.74 yuan, Hengfeng Yarn at 1.03 yuan, and Huaxin Cement at 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Still in Demand</h3>
<p>The foreign stock market is still trending steadily. Credit within the market is not as tight as outside, only around 6 jiao, so yesterday's prices were still high. However, trading was light. Wheelock Marden was very strong, trading as high as 23,000 yuan, an increase of 1,000 yuan from the previous day. Jardine Matheson traded at 7,700 yuan and 8,000 yuan, also slightly higher than the previous day. Shanghai Dockyards saw a slightly lower increase, only about 50 yuan higher than the previous day. Other stocks varied, with both gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Gold Bonds to be Listed This Morning</h3>
<p>Short-term gold bonds will begin trading on the market today. The stock exchange has issued a public announcement, setting the opening auction for this morning. The auction period is from 9:30 am to 12:30 pm and from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm every day. The market is closed on Saturday afternoons. The trading period is divided into spot and one-day futures. The transaction unit is tentatively set at one tael of gold face value. The asking price is the amount of gold yuan per tael of gold. The price increase/decrease unit is tentatively set at 50 yuan, and the daily limit is tentatively set at 10%. The margin for one-day trading is 40%, payable in cash.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Shrinks Again</h3>
<p>[Commodities Research Institute, Hong Kong, 3rd Telegram] Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraphic transfer opened this morning at 1.30 yuan per thousand yuan. The closing rate last night was 1.42 yuan. Gold yuan opened this morning at 2.60 yuan per thousand yuan, the same as the closing price yesterday.

US dollar telegraphic transfer opened this morning at 5.10 yuan, the closing price yesterday was 5.19 yuan. US dollar forward opened this morning at 5.17 yuan, the closing price yesterday was 5.16 yuan. US dollar banknotes opened this morning at 5.15 yuan, the same as the closing price yesterday.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Advances</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tung oil market surged because goods from Hankou had not yet arrived, prices of goods outside the industry were soaring, and credit in the industry was easing. As a result, sentiment was high, and holders were asking for sky-high prices, making it difficult to curb the surge. By the close of the market, prices had risen uniformly by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan, and there were many transactions.</p>
<h3>Price Adjustment of Coal in Keelung</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the latest adjustment of Taiwanese indica rice, the price of Keelung coal from the Four Mines Joint Operations Office was also adjusted yesterday to 62,250 yuan. Imported coal remained unavailable, and the prices of white coal lumps and briquettes remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Soars</h3>
<p>In yesterday's sugar market, buyers were extremely active, and credit within the industry was slightly loose. After the opening, news of soaring rice prices raised sentiment, and buying was very strong.</p>
<p>Grade 45 white refined sugar opened strong at 37,900 yuan, and the upward trend continued, reaching as high as 38,200 yuan. Subsequently, bulls sold at high prices, and the prices of gold, banknotes, and cloth outside the market declined sharply, and credit became slightly tight. Market sentiment turned weak, and the gains were suddenly stalled at noon, falling back 1,100 yuan to close at 37,200 yuan, an increase of 6,000 yuan. Coarse sand sugar saw a unique increase of 7,800 yuan. The prices of other grades, such as white, red, cotton red, sea red, and tea green, all increased by 20% to 25%.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation began selling the 53rd batch of sugar, including one type of Dapu brown sugar in 140-jin bags, priced at 14,500 yuan per dan, with a total of more than 2,000 bags allocated.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar's Market Shrinking</h3>
<p>Sales in North China Already Affected</p>
<p>[United Press, Taipei, 3rd] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which exports 500,000 tons of sugar annually, is now facing the problem of finding a market. Due to the CCP's occupation of North China, Taiwan Sugar's export route has been affected. China's total annual sugar consumption is estimated at about 800,000 tons, of which about half is supplied by provinces such as Sichuan, Fujian, and Guangdong, and the rest is supplied by Taiwan. Overseas, Japan is one of Taiwan Sugar's main importing countries. In this year's Taiwan Sugar exports, one-fifth has been shipped to Japan. In addition, Korea is also one of Taiwan Sugar's markets, but it does not absorb much. Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand have no customers for Taiwan Sugar.</p>
<h3>Silk Spinning</h3>
<p>The silk market entered a spinning pattern yesterday. Initially, the high opening price of off-market gold boosted sentiment, but then credit turned from loose to tight, and the overnight interest rate was not low. Bulls were heavily burdened by interest, and selling was very strong.</p>
<p>120 Tianqiao initially traded at 950,000 yuan. After the opening, it saw a slight rise and the market was still stable. Later, news that cotton yarn had risen sharply and then fallen back, and that gold prices were also softening, made sentiment weak. After observing this, the market turned to spinning. After 11 o'clock, most transactions were for next-day positions. Due to the overnight interest rate, the price rose nominally but fell in reality. It closed near noon at 990,000 yuan. In the afternoon, news that all items outside the industry were not doing well continued to weaken the market. Tianqiao was quoted at 960,000 yuan, a further small decrease of 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw silk yesterday's market initially saw a sharp rise in exchange transfer certificates, and quotations rose accordingly. Foreign merchants showed considerable interest, and sentiment was bullish. Later, exchange transfer certificates were suppressed and fell back, and the gold market also softened, and the trend stopped rising and turned to spinning. Superior grade was initially quoted at 1.2 million yuan. At that time, foreign exchange was falling and gold was quoted low, and holders were unwilling to raise the price again. It once fell back 40,000 yuan. After that, local merchants began to purchase, and the market stabilized (two) to 1.18 million yuan. Finally, exchange transfer certificates rose after falling low, and the market rose overall. It closed at 1.23 million yuan at noon. The market did not fluctuate much in the afternoon, and it was quoted at 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The silk satin market opened yesterday with a firm sentiment. Meiya was initially quoted at 660,000 yuan. It gradually rose slightly in the middle, reaching a high of 680,000 yuan. Afterwards, prices outside the market all rose first and then fell back, and the market turned soft, finally closing at 650,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Stroll</h3>
<p>Spectator: Selling Exchange Transfer Certificates Can Withdraw Credit, but it is Difficult to Suppress Market Sentiment</p>
<p>Recent financial and monetary measures, except for the collection of commodity tax in kind, all cater to market psychology. For example, the opening of gold and silver trading, the opening of self-provided foreign exchange, the listing of gold bonds, and the ability to conduct one-day spot arbitrage, etc. If the system of calculating military pay in silver dollars is also allowed for the people, and people are allowed to freely buy and sell foreign currency, I think it will be even more well-received.</p>
<p>The Shanghai market, which has experienced more than ten years of speculative life, has always been felt by the authorities to be difficult to manage, but they cannot let it go. So, managing and letting go has created the situation of the past. Now, things are opening up step by step, and letting go everywhere, and the situation is not too bad. Isn't this a miracle? Not really! There are reasons for this. Please analyze them intelligently.</p>
<p>In the past, walking the road of sailing against the current, with administrative efficiency lagging behind, of course, nothing could be done. Now, it is believed that catering to the speculative psychology of the market and using the power of the Central Bank to determine success or failure in market struggles, using concentrated attacks to deal with scattered troops, can achieve results for a time. In the eyes of the authorities, the market turmoil has never been related to the overall situation, but to the toxic gas of market speculation. Now, they are taking a method of using poison to fight poison to deal with it.</p>
<p>So, what kind of toxic substance is the authorities using as a weapon to fight poison with poison? In a word, so far, there is only one: the selling and absorbing of exchange settlement certificates. After the gold bonds are listed and auctioned, there may be one more weapon.</p>
<p>Analyzing the first weapon, I deeply feel that it will soon become ineffective.</p>
<p>Selling and absorbing foreign exchange certificates uses the law of supply and demand in the market to manipulate the market price of US dollars, and indirectly manipulate the market price of gold. The prices of gold and banknotes have always been the nerve center of all price changes. Foreign exchange transfer certificates are not real goods. Obtaining a transfer certificate means also holding an import license in hand. Therefore, when gold banknotes are rising sharply, the Central Bank can push them out without limit to suppress the rise. If the amount thrown exceeds the number of licenses issued, the transfer certificates will be secretly withdrawn. When the market rebounds again, it can stop absorbing or release them again.</p>
<p>The key to this method is that with a limited number of import licenses, it wants to sell an unlimited number of transfer certificates, so it must immediately withdraw the amount of excess thrown. Therefore, people in the market now know how to deal with it, namely: (1) When transfer certificates are sold, everyone does not sell gold banknotes. If they have the strength, they will buy them at low prices or try to raise the prices of securities and commodities. (2) Once the clear selling stops, they can return with a vengeance. The Central Bank's secret absorption only helps their profits.</p>
<p>This kind of throwing and absorbing of foreign exchange certificates also has the side effect of withdrawing credit. In fact, the two are mutually contradictory. If selling foreign exchange certificates can tighten credit, someone must drag in the transfer certificates, and the market price cannot be effectively suppressed. If they are thrown out heavily and no one absorbs them, then credit cannot be withdrawn. Therefore, today everyone puts the two things together and thinks that selling foreign exchange certificates and withdrawing credit cause the market price to fall. In reality, this does not make sense.</p>
<h3>Off-Market Soaring Prices Boost Sentiment; Rice Prices Jump Out of the 20,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The rice market unfolded a fierce rising trend yesterday. Due to easing credit and rising prices of goods outside the industry, sentiment was extremely tight. The morning market saw the greatest gains, with japonica and indica rice both exceeding 20,000 yuan. The mid-market saw a gradual decline, and the market strengthened again at the close. In the southern market, white japonica rice was 19,500 yuan, an increase of 3,000 yuan. In the northern market, all rice prices also rose by 2,600 to 2,700 yuan, with special high-grade japonica rice reaching 20,600 yuan. A total of 6,157 shi of goods were registered as arriving in the two markets.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>The rising trend is alarming. Sentiment is high, and holders are trying their best to raise prices. At the opening of the market, soybean oil rose by 10,000 yuan, opening at 78,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil opened at 75,000 yuan. The market was slightly weaker in the later part of the day, with soybean oil closing at 76,000 yuan and rapeseed oil at 74,000 yuan, each rising by 8,000 yuan. A 吉桶 barrel of unrefined oil opened at 92,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 14,000 yuan. Soybean cake had no customers and the price could not rise. 長字 cake was 7,500 yuan, and the market was stable.</p>
<p>Flour rose sharply by 1,000 yuan. The opening of the market saw a sharp rise in gold, banknotes, and rice prices, and credit was stable. Sentiment was extremely bullish, and northern buyers were buying aggressively. Old brands broke the 9,000 yuan mark, setting a new price of 9,200 yuan. 兵船 flour was as high as 8,700 yuan. Midway through the day, news of rice prices falling below the 20,000 yuan mark softened sentiment. Holders were worried about the high prices and were keen to sell, and the market saw a temporary decline. The close of the market saw a rebound of 200 yuan due to continued smooth sales. Old brands were 9,100 yuan and 兵船 flour was 8,550 yuan. Bran followed with a 10% increase. Large packages once hit 7,000 yuan, and closed at 6,750 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Continued to rise sharply. Soybeans initially opened with a sharp increase of 20%. 车豆 was initially quoted at 19,000 yuan, but later news that soybean cake was stable softened sentiment. The official closing price was 17,000 yuan. 乍豆 rose by 10%, and 生仁 factories were keen to buy, pushing the price up by more than 20%. Yangzhou 生仁 reached a peak of 48,000 yuan. Corn rose sharply by 40%. Red sorghum once hit 10,000 yuan. Sesame sales remained smooth and continued to rise.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Slightly Higher, Cloth Market Eagerly Buys</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation is such that all members of the association can apply for yarn and cloth shipments to various ports in South China, hence the confidence of the people. The initial prices of various yarns were set at high levels, and all of them rose further during the session. By the close, due to a slight tightening of credit, the market reversed downwards, resulting in a slightly higher close compared to the previous day.</p>

Jin Cheng and Tian Nu and other yarns also rose by about 30,000 yuan, while other yarns generally showed a firm and stable trend.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market surged again, with no end in sight for the rising trend. This was due to the continued strong interest in buying air, leading all parties to adhere to the principle of holding goods and eagerly buying, causing prices to soar directly. By the close, due to tightening credit within the industry, excessive speculative buying weakened, and the market showed a slight decline.</p>
<p>Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at a new high of 31,700 yuan, then gradually eased, falling to a low of 29,500 yuan.

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests Tax Bureau to Extend Deadline for Filing Profit Income</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Direct Tax Bureau, requesting permission to extend the deadline for filing profit income for the second half of the 37th year, and to promptly approve the implementation measures for contracted tax payments. The original letter stated: Our Chamber previously received your Bureau's official letter stating that the period for filing profit income for the second half of the 37th year of the Republic, from the date of the letter to February 28th, would be the filing period. We were instructed to order all merchants to comply, and we have informed all businesses to investigate and report accordingly. However, according to reports from various businesses, since the promulgation of the Measures for Changing the Registration of Operating Capital Amount Converted to Gold Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has also drafted supplementary measures for changing registration due to the devaluation of the Gold Yuan, in order to implement them. However, to date, the aforementioned supplementary measures have not been promulgated, making it impossible to calculate the capital of industry and commerce and to estimate and depreciate property, which delays the final accounts and prevents the declaration of income. We request that you consult with the Tax Bureau, take into account the reality, and grant an extension, among other things. Considering the circumstances, the reason for the inability to apply within the deadline is not due to industry and commerce, so it is impossible to rush the process. We request that your Bureau report the situation while notifying all tax collection offices to temporarily suspend reminders. In addition, the Executive Yuan meeting on February 23rd passed a financial reform plan, which included "Adopting the method of industry-wide apportionment and contracted payment as much as possible for profit income tax in direct taxes, estimating the tax amount based on the business situation of various industries in various regions, and having the industry associations collect and pay within a time limit to simplify the process." The implementation measures are related to the vital interests of industry and commerce, and we request that your Bureau submit them to the Ministry of Finance for prompt approval and promulgation, so that industry and commerce can conduct prior research and prepare accordingly.</p>

<h3>Autobiography of Joe Louis</h3>
<p>According to Joe Louis's family, what Joe said in this article was probably the most he had ever said in his life: his tenant farmer life in childhood (6), his experience as a famous boxer (6), why he hated Schmelling the most among his many opponents (6), how he confronted his formidable opponent Jim Crow in the U.S. Army (6), and how the money he earned from boxing was spent. (Translated by Cang Long)</p>
<p>People ask me, "Joe, when you were a kid, did you ever dream of being a millionaire, riding in cars, wearing fancy clothes, and having your pockets full of money?" I tell them, "I couldn't dream such luxurious dreams." Indeed, I never dreamed of such things when I was a child; such thoughts never crossed my mind.</p>
<p>When I emerged from boxing, the newspapers wrote a lot of information about me. Some things seemed almost true because they were publicized over and over again. In fact, a large part of it was wrong. Some people said that I was born vigorous, and some people said that I was born with a murderous look. In fact, I was born clumsy. My mother said that I often fell when I was a child. She said that when she went out to work, she was often worried about leaving me alone at home because I often broke things.</p>
<p>I was born in Alabama, USA, on May 13, 1914. The shack where I was born looked like a gust of wind could blow it down. The house was unpainted, and the wallboards around it were loose and about to collapse. My father was named Munroe Barrow. He was six feet three inches tall and weighed nearly two hundred pounds. I was only two years old when he died.</p>
<p>My mother is now sixty-two years old. She is a good woman and has always been a Baptist, so her children have grown up to be followers of the church. Before I made money from boxing, she worked hard to make a living for our group.</p>
<p>My mother was widowed twice. Her second husband was named Pat Brooks, who was also my stepfather. I am second to the youngest of my siblings. When Pan married my mother, he brought five children of his own.</p>
<p>My mother said that among all my siblings, I was a bad child who liked to cry. When I cried, it was so long and loud that it wouldn't stop until she hit me. I wasn't often sick, and I had a big appetite. When I was a child, people often asked me if I was a fighter. In fact, I didn't fight much because I had a strong sense of self-control and took everything with a smile.</p>
<p>But when I became the boxing champion, newspaper reporters often said that it was difficult to get me to say a few words. My mother said that she should tell these reporters that I am almost the same as when I was a child. I didn't speak as clearly as my siblings. When I was in school, the teacher often asked me to read the same words over and over again. I liked to play alone. At that time, I was too young to work in the garden, so I helped feed the chickens and piglets, and sometimes I helped pick cotton. At that time, we didn't often wear shoes, and we saved our good clothes for Sunday. We only lit kerosene lamps in the shack at night.</p>
<p>Some people think that I spend most of my time enjoying myself now, which may be true. But recalling the days when I was a child, there were very few opportunities to enjoy myself. In those years in Alabama, I never didn't understand what race was. At that time, I played with white children, and we never talked about racial differences. I knew that they had things that I didn't have - whiteness, but I saw these things as natural. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Basketball League Upset: Encas Thoroughly Defeats Shanghai Police</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Last night in the second round of the basketball league, Shanghai Police played against Encas again. Everyone thought that Shanghai Police would definitely win, but they were greatly disappointed and an upset occurred. Shanghai Police suffered an unprecedented defeat of 36-60. In the first half, Shanghai Police trailed by nine points, 16-25. Before the match, there were two matches in Group B2: (1) Dolphin defeated Chenyou (Group B2D), 55-22, first half 26-8. (2) US Meteorology defeated Pingping (Group B2C), 60-40, first half 25-15.</p>
<p>Encas had been losing for several games and was getting worse. Everyone looked down on them. Last night, fresh troops were deployed, and Peter, the host of the US Meteorology team, was pulled in to fight, and suddenly became energetic. Peter was the captain of the 1945-6 US National Navy Championship team. His demeanor was truly extraordinary. His shooting and passing, whether on offense or defense, were quite delicate and beautiful. He scored 24 points alone last night, and with the addition of veteran Ke Liboto, Encas was like a tiger with wings.</p>
<p>Shanghai Police were somewhat careless on the court. When the foreign troops rose sharply, it was too late to catch up. Encas had tall figures, and their defense was tight last night, keeping the Shanghai Police from moving. Liang Yongbiao, He Zeng, and He Jingui were all useless because of their short stature. All the balls under the basket were in the hands of the foreign troops, and there was no way to follow up. When attacking again, there was no way to break through the iron curtain, and they could not get under the basket. Their strength and running were not as good as others, and they could not take care of both ends, so Shanghai Police lost.</p>

<p>When the basketball league opened this year, Zhengtai Rubber Factory of this city and ABC Candy Factory jointly donated an electric timer and scorer designed by Qian Xucang, chairman of the Basketball Committee, which was novel and unique. Now, Zhengtai Factory has independently donated a 42-inch round competition standard large electric clock with the Earth brand to the Municipal Gymnasium. A 16-inch square art electric clock is placed inside the gate, which is convenient for the audience and players. Their enthusiasm for sports is commendable.</p>

<h3>High Artillery Basketball Team Debuts in Shanghai, to Battle Shanghai Police Today</h3>
