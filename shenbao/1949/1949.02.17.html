<p>〔合衆社北平十六日電〕自上海人民和平代表團顏惠慶等十四日抵平以來，葉劍英市長及中共其他領袖曾往訪晤，但一切嚴守秘密。顏等現住六國飯店四樓，外籍記者曾於十六日下午寄送代表團一函，但未達到而退回。中國靈通人士間，一般認爲代表團此行甚爲重要，可能成爲國共間之公開橋樑。</p>

<h3>立院復會地點未定　陳克文稱須視時局發展　留穗立委主張投票決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立院秘書長陳克文，赴滬穗桂林等地，與各立委交換關於立院復會日期地點意見，於十六日下午四時許自桂林乘空運隊飛機飛返京。據陳氏語記者，此次在穗·桂等地與各該地立委交換意見結果，對立委對於立院復會之日期及地點，均已作詳盡商討與考慮，留穗立委約八十人，多主在穗復會，留桂立委共四十一人，主張在穗復會者亦在多數，此大多數立委多係於首都緊張混亂時難京，對於首都之情况咸認爲已不適宜於立院集會，惟將來復會地點，仍當視首都之情况及時局之演變決定。現廣州方面對於立院之地址及立委住址，均已有妥當安排，隨時可供立院集會之用，至將來立院復會時之交通工具，立院秘書處亦將設法供應，無論在京在穗，均將由秘書處負責。關於立院復會之日期，陳氏稱，依法必須在二月廿八日以前復會，地點則須俟童院長返京後，綜合各地立委之意見，始能決定。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京十六日電〕立法院秘書處現王在作該院下屆全體大會在京召集會議之凖備。秘書處事務科正在進行租借勵志社各招待所，作爲立委之宿舍。該處並在檢點舊公共汽車，並購備汽油，供立委等往返之需。現在事實上立院已必然仍將在京復會，而非在穗召集。粵立委抵此參加者已有七人，傳不久復有晋京者。此點打破以前所傳粵立委一致主張在穗復會之說。此外，湖南亦有若干立委返此出席。據在滬立委暗示，會期爲本月廿五日。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十六日電〕據悉：孫科昨與留穗立委座談結果，決請由留穗立委推派代表二人，將於短期內分赴桂·台·川·豫等地，邀請各地立委來穗商討在穗復會問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十六日電〕留穗立法委員十五日午在穗市迎賓館集會，商討復會地點問題，通過致電南京童院長冠賢，主張投票決定。原電云：南京立法院童院長冠賢並轉南京各委員勛鑒：關於本院第三曾期集會地點，報載各地同人意見不一，有主張在穗復會者，有主張在京者，亦有主張在京復會然後休會考慮遷穗舉行者；在穗同人爲此問題，於十五日集議，僉以政院遷穗辦公之初，本院留京留滬同人曾舉行座談會，當亦決定南遷，並由劉副院長，延副秘書長來穗籌備復會事宜，現職員均已抵穗，鑒於目前時局之嚴重，和談仍待努力，在穗集會至爲適宜，惟各地同人意見旣然紛歧，實有從長商討之必要，以表示本院團結精神，倘商討未能一致，則應由各地委員投票表示取決於全體之會，若某一地區以超過五分之一遽然集會，勢將引起糾紛，不唯無補時艱，甚致貽誤國事，區區之見，尙請向本院同人代爲轉達。旬前先生蒞穗促進團結之精神，同人等咸深敬佩，相信對此問題，必能溝通各方獲取一致意見，尤盼大駕與留京滬同人共同商決，早日聯袂南來。謹電佈達，並盼示覆。留穗立法委員叩。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十六日電〕立院秘書處職員二百餘抵穗後，頃已正式開始辦公，積極開展工作，並特設服務科，招待到穗立委，對立委之食宿已吿解決，政院特撥借交通銀行與農民銀行宿舍，並包括鳳凰，粵東，西濠三旅館爲立委住所，計可住有眷委員三百家（每家兩房），單身委員五百人（每兩人一房），膳食亦已包定專廚負責，日來各地立委陸續來穗，昨復有侯庭督，彭醇大，虞示濂等由南昌飛抵此間。</p>
<h3>首者戒嚴時間　昨晚開始縮短</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕李代總統十五日午在傅厚崗官邸宴首都各治安機關負責人，到張耀明·單異之·陳沛·張鎭·萬建藩·黃珍吾等，席間李代總統面諭張總司令等，以首都治安鞏固，國軍江防堅强，江北共軍主力後撤，可將戒嚴時間後移一小時，卽每晚自十二時起開始戒嚴，至翌晨五時爲止，張等奉命後，已於十六日晚開始執行。</p>
<h3>華南民防司令部　在廣州正式成立</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十六日電〕華南區民防司令部於十六日正式成立，由綏署余主任漢謀兼任司令，陳獨其·黄國樑·吳禮三氏任副司令·該部主要工作：（一）加強粵；桂三省防空工作；（二）搜集情報，供海陸空軍使用；（三）增進市民防空常識，將來在粵·閩·海南島等地區設立防空辦事處。</p>
<h3>銀圓將准許流通　黃金外洪可能自由買賣　徐財長在滬昨竟日主持重要會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財長徐堪昨竟日在愚園路官邸主持重要會議，聞國行負責人員及本市金融界首要均參加，央行總裁劉攻芸並抽睱與美籍友人會商，內容均嚴守秘密。官方對發行銀圓之說，完全否認，但財政當局為維持全國幣制之統一，阻止各種地方貨弊之出現起見，可能准許民間之銀圓合法流通，由央行逐日掛牌。規定與金圓券之聯緊，並准許銀行收受存放。此外，黃金·外匯亦將公開自由買賣，由於「八一九」幣制改革之失敗，當局已不敢輕率從事幣制改革，而庫存之銀圓又該不足以供應全國之需要，故可能採取此項折喪辦法，以維持金圓劵之信用。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十五日電〕財畏徐堪親携財政經濟改革方案赴滬，運日在滬與金融界作廣泛交換意見，並俟晋京作最後決定，約十八日可返穗。</p>
<h3>探討美對我國局勢見解　顧維鈞訪晤艾契遜　並談及援華問題但無決議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞十五日談稱：中國政府「不要危害自由之和平」。顧氏在與國務卿艾契遜舉行一簡短之會議後吿記者稱：此次會晤，係欲「探取美國政府對中國局勢之意見」。</p>
<p>顧氏又稱：當所有人民大部份皆急欲看到和平之際，渠明白表明，彼等所欲之和平，乃爲自由及維護國家獨立之和平，在此種和平下，彼等之政治權利得以保護，並不是任何條件下之和平及妨害自由之和平。</p>
<p>顧氏並坦白聲稱：渠並未「見到國共間和談之任何決定性進展」。</p>
<p>顧大使末稱：渠興艾氏曾談中，曾談及美國軍新對華援助之問題，但未有決議」。</p>
<h3>美共和黨議員要求重行檢討對華政策　共黨在華勝利即美國之失敗</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十五日電〕共和黨衆議員五十一人頃提出要求，主要由一髙級軍事政治及經濟顧問組成之委員會準備一項關於中國局勢之報吿。各衆議員稱：共黨在中國之勝利卽係美國之永久性與歷史性的失敗，幷爲對國家安全之嚴重威脅。在今晚公布之致杜魯門總統函中，各議員建議設立此一委員會幷提出七項問題，以澄淸美國之對華政策。簽名者中，七人爲衆院外交事務委會委員，其他數人在過去衆院考慮外交關係時亦多建樹。自去年競選運動迄今，若干共和黨發言人曾不斷要求美國增加對中國國民政府之援助。外委會委員簽名於函中者計看洛琪，史密斯，傑克遜，墨魯，周以德，鮑爾頓。其他簽名者計有第八十屆國會衆院外援特別委員會主席赫德，威茨華斯，安德遜，基飛。</p>
<p>該函激烈批許美國對華政策，稱美國曾圖覓致國民黨與共產黨間之聯合，而結果則「貽害無窮」。函中指出捷克業已「戲劇性的顯示」此種政策之危險，捷克通過其聯合政府，而被「拖入鐵幕之後」。</p>
<p>函中幷進一步聲明：中國共產黨似已抵達勝利之邊緣。簽名者認爲：中共之勝利不僅將形成對美國嚴重之危脅，亦且意味「自由力量之失敗」。該函繼向總統提出有關目前美國對華政策之間題，幷詢問是否已計劃變更對華政策。此外，該函幷詢政府擬否支持中國反共份子（如國民黨）將共黨侵略問題當作對和平之威脅而提出聯合國時，則美國將採何種立塲。函中幷間：如美國已盡其開羅及雅爾達協議中對中國之義務，則美國將採何種步驟以導引蘇聯遵守其與中國在雅爾達會議後所締結條約之義務。該函繼建議成立委會以重新撿討整個局勢，幷將調査所得向總總統及國會提出報吿。</p>
<h3>許惠東已被捕</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平十六日電〕此間今日發起一種運動，要求槍斃前北平市參議會議長許惠東，學生方面認許應負七五慘案死學生九名，傷三十七名之責。據新民報載稱：許已被捕。</p>
<h3>曾澤生都被改編</h3>
<p>正加緊「政治整訓」</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十三日廣播：據中共廣播稱：前在長春戰役中被俘之國軍曾澤生部六十二軍，已於二月一日經「人民解放軍總部」改編爲第五十軍，並於十六日在潘陽舉行授名典禮。廣播中指出，中共軍方面對於俘降之國軍「正加緊政治整訓，改造思」想，以期早日開赴前綫，與國軍作戰，並驅逐美帝國主義出中國」。</p>

<h3>革新政治必須兌現！</h3>
<p>李代總統前晚廣播：謀取和平，革新政治，尤其者重於革新政治，　肅官常和軍紀。這實在是目前人人所要說的話！</p>
<p>自蔣總統發表元旦文吿開誠謀和以來，和平希望雖若明若暗，若斷若續，但總算還有一些希望。然而說到政治，則此一個半月以來的官塲情形，實在太不像樣了！長江北岸的戰事尙未移至江邊，而南京的達官貴人早已爭先恐後，忙着遷移。不要說火車站，輪船碼頭，或飛機傷的秩序，紊亂不堪，就是各部會的辦公室，也搞得一團糟。這個樣子的政府，難怪要遭受到共產黨廣播的譏笑！倘再不下大決心，痛快改革，不要說不能再戰，就是想謀和也恐有所不能。我們感傷於國事的日非，早就指出，政府大員如不能大澈大悟，洗心革面，那只有投降受審判而已，何能侈談和平，更何能幻想戰爭？到前晚，李代總統也忍不住要說出切中時弊的老實話了。</p>
<p>李代總統說：「我們政府必須完成兩項爲全國人民所迫切要求的任務：第一是謀取和平，第二是革新政治。關於後者，就是在整肅官常和軍紀，換言之，就是要先從全國軍政人員的心理上和行爲上的革新做起。」最後又說：「政府之謀取和平與革新政治這兩項決策，雖然對象不同，可是兩者的目的則一，都是基於遵循人民意志和解除人民痛苦這個最髙原則而來的。」這一番話，不僅說出了全國人民壓在心頭要說而未能盡說的話，而且也是政府本身的當前要圖。不論對中共謀和或繼續作戰，革新政治以减輕人民的痛苦，都是成功的先決條件。不過政府當局高叫「革新」的口號，由來已久，不論調子唱得如何的髙，政治的貪汚無能依然如故，而且有每况愈下之感。所以我們希望李代總統不要止於廣播，徒然空口髙談革新政治，而應該一改過去黨人慣做「新八股」的作風，切實的進一步做到說話的兌現。國人如能看到李代總統的改革政治，決非空頭支票，而眞能做到「不顧一切困難，排除一切障礙，務必達到目的而後已」，然後政府方可重建威信，然後方可以言其他。</p>
<p>論及我國近年來的政治，中外一致認爲弊在貪汚無能，即身負重責的最髙黨局也不能否認，且也曾幾次三番想要加以革新。可是革來革去，始終不見面目一新。其廠結何在呢？很明顯的，乃在政府與人民的脫節。政府的握權者，始終只在幾個新舊官僚圈子中找人，始終只在敷衍搪塞，因循　預地求辦法，而沒有看到人民，沒有想到人民，沒有在廣大的人民繁中選拔眞才！老實說，中等以下的公務員，大半都能奉公守法，廉潔自好，雖在髙物價的壓迫之下，衣食不週，但仍能枵腹從公。固然，也有許多點卯不做事的，徒耗國帑，但大多數公務員的艱苦生活，不僅値得我們的同情，而且非常値得讀佩的，他們決不是革新政治的對象。這一大羣的公務員，如果有好人在上領導，是可以努力的。至所謂貪汚無能的官吏，僅是一小部份涵跡其間，爲非作惡，利用職務上的便利，假公濟私，無所不爲。只要能淸除這一小部份的敗類，這一小部份的寄生份子，政治立即可望淸明。</p>
<p>然而這些營私舞弊的貪官汚史，都有其有恃無恐的靠山，如果政府當局不能痛下決心，破除情面，大公無私的去幹，這些政府中的敗類，必定依然無法淸除。不但無法淸除，而且一人得道，鷄犬昇天，勢必愈來愈多。儘管你髙叫革新政治，政治貪汚無能如故也。所以我們希望李代總統革新政治，第一要看淸對象，而且還要用「擒賊擒王」「殺一儆百」的辦法，先從嚴辦幾個有權勢做靠山的貪官汚吏做去，揭聞政府的「絨幕」，歡迎人民檢舉貪汚，使他們無法再溷跡於政府之中。第二要有大公無私的精神。「法之不行，自上犯之。」「刑于寡妻，以至於家邦。」這些話都是古聖賢的明訓。李代總統如要肅淸一切貪汚腐化份子，如能先從他的左右親信開始，以創始他鐵面無情的新政作風，那必定能使中外耳目一新，即中共之對於政府，也必要另換一副眼光來估價了。</p>
<p>抗戰八年，內爭三年，中國人民已够苦的了，再加受了貪官汚吏的刺削與魚肉，到現在實在有活不下去之苦。棄戰言和自爲人人所渴望，然就近來情勢看法，和平當非一蹴可成，在其過渡期內，我們老百姓只有希望政府趕快革新政治，以解除人民的痛苦。李代總統今旣決心革新政治，可以說是了解人民的；但願其大刀闊斧，身體力行，以事實來使他革新政治的支票能够兌現。</p>

<h3>看華中新形勢</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　房滄浪</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十二日訊〕該是春天了，但在華中各地還很難聽到一點春消息，如果將春天象徵和平，這季節顯然反常，加之最近這三四天，這裏又下了二塲大雪，益覺使人有「春行冬令」之感，意識可愛的春天還在那和戰最後關頭徘徊，人們的心頭不免有點兒苦悶！</p>
<p>癬疥小病　不足為患</p>
<p>稍有軍事地理常識的人們，都曾經爲華華中捏了一把汗，但在徐蚌撤守戰火遜近長江下游北岸邊沿的今天，由於國軍制空權，制海權，極可能在上游三百里，下游五百里的長江封鎖綫上，配合江防第一綫的陸軍，發揮應有的威力，由於華東華中各地的共軍的兵力，工具，和應付天空水上打擊的辦法，尙覺不够，說明在現代立體戰爭中，這一個地區，在時間上，空間上，已經討着極大便宜，使古老的宜攻地理形勢，一變而成爲攻守兩宜的活絡陣地。今日之華中，是頭枕巴蜀，脚跨皖贛，左扼陜豫，右倚三湘，而且在牠頭部所在的沙（市）宜（昌），脚部所在的安慶·九江，左右兩臂所控制的平漢·粵漢兩綫，乃至心藏所在的武漢三鎭核心及其外圍，保育了六十萬足以應付來自豫南·鄂東·鄂中·鄂北或皖北的任何襲擊。十天以前，豫南的轉危爲安，以及最近一週當局從容穩定江北岸沙宜的戰局，都可證明共軍若不能在江（長江北岸）漢（漢水兩岸）河（襄河兩岸）豫南平原，與夫大別·大洪·桐柏·三山，集中卅萬大軍，休想在上述任何一區得手，所以我說：華中現在幾點之擾人的癬疥，尙不足爲大患。</p>
<p>各地軍民　提高警覺</p>
<p>華中局勢，雖日改觀，但人爲的因素，亦値一談。華中軍事當局白健生上將，這一位富有機智的天才軍事專家，也的心思非常細密，他到了華中以後，確實做了幾件事。大如限田授田的土地問題，小至渙口碼頭的風氣，他都能以一種高瞻遠矚的眼光，命令有司，督促改善。最近漢定自二月份起捕助兵警副食費銀元一枚，尤合時宜，因爲過去每個士兵的副食費，每天只有一元五角金圓劵，還不够買一兩白菜，實在苦得不成話。漢口最近槍決了一個搶米犯，一個販賣銀元的擾亂金融犯，對於穩定華中幣値發生預期效果，也極得人心。這是在進步中求安定的絕妙良方。現在華中各地的軍民，對於未來局勢的發展，似乎都已提高了警覺，尤其是軍中的官兵，他們每個人過去都曾以一種哀傷的心情，盼望和平，希冀解甲歸田，做一個太平老百姓，想不到對方竟如此　預，在咄咄逼人的局勢下，他們已感覺失望，似乎已經變怯爲恨，恨出勁兒來了。這是人類的一種本能。武漢耆紳中有人曰：爲中共計，也是以和爲貴，因爲民廿四五年間，共軍的二萬五千里長征，那股腿勁，就是恨出來的。</p>
<p>豫南鄂中　哀鴻遍野</p>
<p>華中國軍部隊中，哀兵特多，戰鬥意志，日見堅强，哀兵必滕，見諸古訓，何况這裏的軍官，大多已經窮得沒錢洗衣服，這現象和東綫的情况，也顯然有別。試舉一例，當廢曆除夕，豫南確山·信陽等地大換防的時候，由確信南移的軍人，雖然像大搬塲，但塲面並不太富麗，可是轉瞬間，北上的大軍如張淦兵團，官兵們都是輕裝减累的結成一個戰鬥體，向前直奔，豫南人民看到這股勁兒，方才安了心，而那些來自東北兩面，冒充陳劉兩記的土共，終於在幾個慣於投機的會官劣紳嚮導下，聞風而逃，於是豫南轉危爲安，大家忙復員，此外，在鄂中的荆門與當陽，以及沙市和宜昌的附近，最近都曾發現類此的現象。國軍在處理情報方面，似乎還需要作更大的努力，因爲華中的癬疥雖不足爲大患，可是豫南。鄂中多處地方的人民，已經在流寇型的土共滋擾時哀哀欲絕了。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕外交人士及國會人士頃指出，關於北大西洋公約談判，業已進入最嚴重階段。此等消息靈通人士暗示本來預定於下月初卽可完成談判，由於對美國應允許負祖協助西歐國家抵抗侵略至何種程度的爭持，可能延遲。</p>
<p>若干國會議員表示，他們担心目前草約中的措辭，在解釋時將被引過遠。但另一方面，若干歐洲外交家則宣稱，目前的草約在保證參與國家迎擊武裝侵略，尙感不足。</p>
<p>國務卿又與遜在招待記者會中，遭遇一項詢問，卽關於參院外委會主席康納利主張美國本身在決定是否當援助任何被攻擊的歡洲國家時，應不受約束。外交家祖心任何對北大西洋公約進一步的削弱，可能使其不能爲若干歐洲國家所接受。如康納利建議被採納，則該公約顯將較美洲國家於一九四七年在里約鷙內慮簽訂的東半球公約更爲軟弱，在里約熱內盧公約中，參與國家認爲對任何一國的攻擊，卽爲對全體的攻擊，而規定每一國家應有「協助迎擊」的義務，施用武力以下的行動，在參與國家三分之二通過時，卽可執行。</p>
<h3>康納利二次聲明</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕參院外委會主席康納利昨日聲明反對北大西洋盟約使美國負有自動參戰之養務一舉，已引起外國方面軒然大波。康氏今日特發表二次聲明，謂盟約雖不必規定歐洲方面如有一簽約國被攻，美國須自動出兵相助，但美國可保證「採取某種必要指施，以維持北大西洋區安全」，如此則與美國憲法可不抵觸，歐洲各國亦可安心。參院現定於下星期一討論此事</p>
<h3>獲得英方諒解　挪外長返國</h3>
<p>挪將拒與蘇締不侵條約</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十六日電〕挪威外長闌淇今晨乘機返國，最近數日蘭淇與英當局之談判，證明極爲滿意。蘭淇於離英前談稱，「予敢斷言英挪兩國目前頗能互相訪解。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十五日電〕據消息靈通方面聲稱，挪威政府俟外長返國後，大約將在本週末前答覆蘇聯所致之盟會，拒絕與之締結互不侵犯條約。</p>
<h3>美藝術協會公布　全世界十大美人</h3>

<h3>安理會討論南韓入會案　蘇代表堅決反對　最後決議交會籍小組重行審查</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十五日電〕聯合國安理會十五日在蘇聯强烈反對中，將南韓申請人會事，交與會籍委員會審査。蘇代表馬立克反對考慮南韓之申請，指責南韓政府「僅爲美國佔領當局之一地方支部」，並認爲申請入會「等於對韓國人民的侮辱」。安理會九對二票壓倒馬立克之反對，將申請交與安理會十一國代表所組之會籍委員會審查、照馬立克坦白攻擊美國所支持之南韓政府看，當會籍委員會在將來提出建議時，蘇聯將使用第三十次否決權。美代表奧斯丁反對蘇聯支持的北韓政府申請入會。</p>

<h3>鐵路工潮擴大　六千工人來請願　軍警赴眞如堵截　工人代表抵滬談判尚無結果</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路管理局工潮，昨日突又擴大，京滬，滬杭兩綫火車竟日停頓。路局戚　　機車廠，常州車傷，及無錫，蘇州等站工人約六千人，專車來滬請願。本市治安當局聞訊，特派大隊軍警沿鐵路前往攔阻，並臨時炸毀路軌一小段，工人請願列車卒被阻於眞如楊家橋附近（離眞如站三公里半）。經多方勸導結果，工人推出各單位負責人四十餘人，來滬與局方談判待遇問題，請願車退回南翔站，至深夜十一時許尙未聞有談判結果，今日上午兩路火車仍難望恢復正常。</p>
<p>兩路局本市工人於前日下午因不滿局方十四日新公布之新待遇，曾一度罷工請願，經王局長答應今後員工待遇依電信局同樣辦理，並即日起先發每人五千元後，工人已於當晚恢復工作。惟本市工人在請願時，曾電話通知戚廠工人，戚廠得訊響應，於當日（十五日）下午五時，開出專車，擬來滬加入請願。路局得訊，一面命沿途各站站長勸阻列車前進，一面由副局長兼機務處長陳福海前往勸導。陳於昨日上午到達無錫站後，請願車亦已抵錫。工人羣衆立將陳氏包圍，提出要求三項：（一）立即發給疏散費每人食米二石，（二）補發行政院新公布之正月份雙薪，（三）最低薪給工人食米二石，工頭四石，技工三石半。雖經陳解釋上海方面工人已經恢復工作，王局長已允許照電信局待遇及先發五千元，但毫無效果，羣衆仍堅持必須來滬。</p>
<h3>刧持沿綫各站長　權充「人質路籤」</h3>
<p>下午一時許，羣衆將陳副局長及無錫站站長張慕陶刦持上車，權充路籤。（按火車不得站長發給路籤，列車不得前進）。其他常州站站長林孝錦，南翔站站長何志華等均被邀上車，充當「人質路籤」。京滬杭警備總司令湯恩伯聞報，大爲震怒，認爲工人如有改善待遇等項要求，儘可推派代表與局方談判，聚衆請願，有違戒嚴法令，遂通令沿綫軍警阻止列車來滬。駐防於常州·石塘灣·無錫·蘇州·外跨塘·崑山等處交警，雖經嗚槍警吿，仍不能阻止列車前進。</p>
<p>官兵出動　沿路佈防</p>
<p>列車過蘇州時，情勢越趨緊張。本市治安當局調集大批軍警保護北火車站及管理局，虬江路一帶宣佈臨時戒嚴，同時調五二軍二營官兵携帶全部作戰配備，開往眞如以西楊家橋附近，沿鐵道布防。湯總司令並派參謀長曹汝珍坐鎭管理局負責處理因工潮所引起之治安上問題。淞滬警備司令部稽査處處長何龍慶，統一稽査所所長黄志遠，路局警務處處長錢鶴皋，會同路局員工福利會專員張雲鶴，兩路特別黨部主任委員李達三，工會理事高其福·袁巧福等，曁大隊路警·機動大隊·警衛營等軍警人員，於下午三時半趕往眞如。</p>
<p>炸斷路軌　阻車前往</p>
<p>記者等隨同前往，過眞如站西行一公里許，遠望鐵道盡處，白烟滾滾，請願列車已可望見。何龍慶處長因鑒於情勢緊急，已不及尋找道工拆除鋼軌，乃命用手榴彈二枚，將道軌一小段炸毀。五二軍士兵分散撲臥戰壕，凖備於工人不受命令時，實彈射擊。警備部特務營裝甲車五輛，亦於此時由副營長黄榮武率領趕到。列車司機望見紅旗及軍隊戒備情形，乃不得不停車待命。五二軍李副團長卽派兵上機車監視，並將被工人置放於車頭上作「避彈盾」之陳副局長解救下車。</p>
<p>接受勸導　退回南翔</p>
<p>何龍慶·錢鶴皐，李主委及工會理事等，卽於車旁召集工人代表訓話，勸導以社會秩序及交通爲重，請全體工人暫退南翔，由各單位所推出之負責人來滬與各局長談判待遇問題。經反覆勸導後，於七時十五分，工人允由一輛機車推所附掛之二十八輛蓬車退回南翔，另一機車來滬加煤，（工人列車中掛有救險車，炸斷之路軌由其搶修）。上海方面工人於聞悉常州戚廠工人來滬消息後，亦曾緊集工人一千四百餘人，乘專車前往歡迎，該列車被軍隊圍阻於眞如站，及後聞來滬工人退回，亦開回上海。路局總務處因得悉來滬請願工人已一晝夜未得飲食，臨時凑集現款卅萬元，收購油條大餅饅頭餅乾等食物送往南翔，分送請願員工充饑。工人代表四十餘人由路局招待晚餐。車站及管理局四週仍有大批軍隊及裝甲車保衛，至十夜未撤。</p>

<h3>警備司令談話　分析工潮種類原因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕淞滬警備司令陳大慶昨在每月招待記者例會上對最近本市工潮迭起發表談話稱：分析工潮種類，有怠工·罷工·聚衆要挾·暴動破壞等四種。其原因或由於經濟性，或屬於政治性搗亂及派系鬥爭。對於怠工及罷工，渠認爲工會應與社會局切實合作，最好能消弭於事前，否則亦應妥謀解決於事後。至若聚衆要挾及暴動破壞者，則警備部將嚴厲取締，其爲首者逮捕後就地檢決。政治性工潮之幕後操縱陰謀份于査獲後亦決嚴懲不貸云。</p>

<h3>晨友杯有主　回力三分遭慘敗　晨友劇戰獲冠軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕晨及盃籃球甲組錦標重決賽最後一塲，晨友對回力，昨晚七時，在市體育館火拼。觀衆千餘人，熱烈緊張，結果晨友苦戰以四十五比四十二擊敗回力，榮膺冠軍，上半時廿三比十六，回力落後七分。晨友昨以柔克剛，各個演出以王伯文最爲得體，王蓉生何增亦不惡。回力求勝心切，未免過於緊張，曹志吉威風不减，王永芳田福海亦各顯神射，但以整個比賽言，確無第二戰好，遂以三分慘敗。友誼賽健樂對康隊，上半時廿四比廿二，康隊領前二分，比賽局勢緊湊，結果健樂四十二比三十八反敗爲勝。</p>
<p>上場接觸　難分勝負</p>
<p>晨友對回力兩隊，晨友盃甲組錦標生死之戰，七時零五分開始，接觸後王永芳傅其俠先後命中，田福油加一罰球，回力三比二居前。晨友叫停，老曹亦罰中，仁餘王伯文擲罰雙收，田再罰中成五平，允全何增立添三分，晨友八比五追出。魏戍伯文各爲其主，十一比七，回力亦重商戰略。回力數次罰球未中，永芳遂試用遠投，居然命中，十一比九漸形接近，曹志吉翻身一怪球，十一分平手。梁雄標入替史允全，分敷遂上下不定，伯文苦爭，晨友二十比十三重佔優勢，上半時廿三比十六，晨友領前七分。</p>
<p>雙方混戰　晨友佔先</p>
<p>休息時間中給獎，由康際文夫人發給，冠軍隊莫不笑逐顏開。比賽再起，更形緊張，志吉其俠何增福海各顯威風，廿七比廿晨友暫停，從此雙方各顯穿楊妙技，分數狂增，尙存十分鐘時，爲三十三比廿七。不久回力張浦替魏戍出，雙方混戰，俱難進展，晨友仍佔先鞭，回力球運亦不佳，常在籃圈盤旋，迨志吉保康得手，漸吿接近，三十八比三十四尙差兩球。回力犯規較多，予對方罰球機會，影響士氣，亦屬失策，分數又復脫離，四三比三十六，晨友第五次暫停。魏戍遠中，保康犯規，以尙崇嶽代之，志吉亦中籃，但晨友仍以四十五比四十二得冠軍。</p>

<h3>黃金公債牌價再高　正式上市開拍須至下月初</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黄金公債牌價爲六萬六千二百五十元，較前日掛髙三千八百五十元，零星傷出數量不多，惟證交經紀人集體認購，爲數可達一億。至於黄金公價之上市日期，外界傳說不一，頃自國行方面獲悉，證交市塲雖定二月廿一日復業，但黄金公債之正式上市，恐需在下月份始能成爲事實，因證交停業已久，一旦復業，頭緒紛紜，解決需時。且黄金公債目前發行者，爲預約劵而非正式債劵，上市開拍，將來在調換時亦多困難，故黄金公債之上市開拍，尙需時日。</p>
<h3>銀根緊勢已懈　現鈔籌碼仍枯</h3>
<p>昨日市問銀根，因外埠匯款有到，加以工商發薪，游資外供甚多，緊勢漸懈。唯業外各帮，因週轉關係，勢仍逞斂。市拆在每千元日拆七十元至九十元間，大致爲八十元左右。瀕午業內頭寸流出，日拆低至七十元。現鈔籌碼，昨日仍匱，本票大事流行，貼水昻於百分之四。業內行莊最髙限領一萬元云。</p>
<p>中央銀行，爲緊縮市塲信用，各行莊交換餘額，十六日起限制取現爲百分之三十。如有特殊情行，須經總裁親自核准，始能取用。頃悉：日來市塲現鈔奇缺，已發生貼水現象，最大原因，由於匯水過高。如重慶成都等地，由滬匯往之匯款，每千爲四　百元。大多商家均携運現鈔套取匯水，以致大批現鈔外流。</p>
<h3>經紀人保證金　大部份已繳納</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市證劵交易所已定廿一日正式復業，各經紀人保證金經規定分股票與債券兩種，各爲卅萬元，以百分之四十爲現金，必須於十六日中午十二時以前繳納。其餘百分之六十，以上市之債劵或國營股票抵充之，定十九日中午十二時以前繳齊。昨爲繳納現款截止日期，據證交統計，繳納股票部份之經紀人，已達一九九家。繳納債券部份者有一四〇家。其中單獨經營股票者有六十家，債券者一家，兼營者一三九家，共計二百家，共收保證金現金四〇六八萬元。</p>
<h3>呢絨需供有限</h3>
<p>毛絨品呢羢，邇來已形成需供有限之局而，廠方對種種環境關係，雖迎續漲價，尙難獲利。店方鑒於售出後難以補進，手貨步翻步劣，且多减缺，大半俱抱一動不如一靜熊度。需銷方面，客路因時局關係，範圍縮狹。本街則以髙物價下售價昻貴，兼以天氣尙未轉暖，春銷未能發動，以致邇日零躉生意，寥寥無幾，標凖行情因比無甚大上落。</p>
<h3>絲綢俏利</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况繼續上漲，圈外金價疾升，業內銀根先鬆後濫，人心初昻後平。一二〇號天橋晨開四四萬元，中間銀根尙鬆，買氣濃厚，市勢再見盤升，惟因開盤已髙，升勢不動，近午因圈外紗布再好，但銀根稍緊，納胃似稍遜色，隔日頭寸做四八五〇〇〇元了結。午後銀根轉緊，暗息又髙升至九十元百元問，散戶脫手，價見回軟，天橋喊四十六萬元四十七萬元。</p>
<p>生絲昨日以外匯市價猛升，金融黑市疾升，人心奇揚，優級另担晨開四九萬元，開後納胃仍殷，喊價續升，午收五一萬，升十萬元。</p>
<p>無緞昨市初開卽停，漲勢銳勵，塲外交易繼續上升。華强被面初開三十萬，塲內交易卽吿停止，塲外喊升三十一萬，美亞先做三〇五〇〇〇元，嗣後亦升一萬元，升後微盤微升，迨至午收，因銀根稍緊，買氣轉平，喊價亦見站住。</p>
<p>桐油猛晉</p>
<p>甫吿平定之桐油趨勢，昨日市上晨初漲風，卽若死灰復燃，迨後竟一路上升，喊價比前爲挺。人心告秀，居奇高扳者四起，市氣飛晋，全日交易亦頗活躍。</p>
<p>國行少突然停止</p>
<p>美援會及央行委託中紡在市塲拋紗抑平物價一事，進行頗久。昨日是項工作，突吿停止，此中原因，央行拒不發表。因此消息傳出，引起紗價飛漲。至於今日是否繼續拋售，中紡央行不得而知。</p>
<h3>紗布激漲</h3>
<p>紗市以外埠匯款源源湧至，市上銀根略感鬆象，且金融性物品報漲，執有者心理振作，扳持殊刀，在貨主不思出下，漲風再接再厲。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳自五十七萬元步昻至六十一萬元收市，終挺十二萬元。他若天女與寳光等，亦各髙十萬元左右。三二支銀月漲八萬元，以四十六萬五千元結局。二一支雙馬現貨，初以三十七萬元開出，中途曾哄抬至三十九萬元，最後又回至三十七萬二千元，較前昻四萬七千元。二〇支雙馬以三十三萬元收市，軋升四萬五千元。一六支以下粗紗漲勢較熾，漲達三成左右。</p>

<h3>業外各物狂漲　食米猛烈升騰　北市場白粳出萬元大關</h3>
<p>米市猛騰，因黑市金價狂漲，業外各物，莫不一致上升，人心振動，故亦追踪猛升。北市塲漲勢較南市尤烈。北市塲白粳初開越出萬元，曾做一萬〇五百元，後因金價回低，人心亦平，况南市價格上漲較少，收市乃漸回軟，白粳終以一萬元收市，薄稻亦做萬元，早稻九千七百元，各狂漲一千七八百元，白元一萬〇二百元。南市塲白粳曾喊萬元，終開九千五百元，其他各米均漲千元，南北市到貨共計四三一〇石</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Decides Not to Move Back to Nanjing; Sun Ke Officially Denies Resigning; Wu Yuhou and Others Fly to Guangzhou to Report on Their Trip to Beiping; Ye Jianying Visits Yan Huiqing and Others for Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 16th] Executive Yuan President Sun Ke recently told reporters: Rumors that he had submitted his resignation to Acting President Li are purely unfounded. He absolutely denies any talk of resignation, and stated that he has no intention of returning to Zhongshan or going to Macau, and that the date of his return to Nanjing has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] According to an important responsible person at the Presidential Office, rumors that Executive Yuan President Sun Ke has submitted his resignation to Acting President Li, or that Sun entrusted Presidents Yu and Tong of the two legislative bodies to submit his resignation on his behalf, and various rumors that Huang Shaohong, He Yingqin, and others would form a cabinet, are not true.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The Jing Evening News reported that Sun Ke had resigned to Acting President Li, and that Li Hanhun came to Nanjing to submit the resignation on behalf of President Sun. When Li met with reporters on the 16th, he denied this and officially stated that the above news was absolutely untrue.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Guangzhou, 16th] The Executive Yuan passed a resolution in today's political affairs meeting not to move back to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Wu Yuhou, Wu Zhesheng, Wang Hun, and other members of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation flew from Nanjing to Guangzhou on the Executive Yuan's special plane at 7 a.m. on the 16th, arriving at 2 p.m. that day. They immediately went to the Executive Yuan to visit Secretary-General Duanmu. Due to fatigue from the long flight, they plan to rest briefly and then pay their respects to President Sun and Vice President Wu Tiecheng within the next few days. These first peace envoys to depart obtained President Sun's consent before going to Beiping and flew on the Executive Yuan's special plane. This time, in addition to visiting President Sun, they will also publicly meet with reporters to report on their negotiations with the Chinese Communists in Beiping, the Communist attitude towards peace talks, and the current situation in Beiping.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 17th] Professor Xia Yuanzhi, a member of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation who returned from Beiping, revealed on the 17th that Ye Jianying had agreed in principle that if current peace efforts failed, Nanjing and its people would not be subjected to artillery fire or other war damage. Xia said that Ye Jianying had told him that he would recommend to the Communist high command that Nanjing be spared from war damage under any circumstances. A response may be given in a later broadcast. He said that Ye Jianying suggested that Nanjing should follow the example of the peaceful resolution in Beiping. To this, he replied, "This is impossible because Nanjing's position is different from that of Beiping. It is the capital of China."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 16th] Since the Shanghai People's Peace Delegation, led by Yan Huiqing and others, arrived in Beiping on the 14th, Mayor Ye Jianying and other Communist leaders have visited them, but everything has been kept strictly secret. Yan and his party are currently staying on the fourth floor of the Six Nations Hotel. Foreign reporters sent a letter to the delegation on the afternoon of the 16th, but it was returned undelivered. Insiders in China generally believe that this trip by the delegation is very important and may become an open bridge between the Nationalists and the Communists.</p>

According to Li's remarks to reporters on the 16th, the government is indeed sincere in its desire for peace talks. Whether the Chinese Communists are sincere or not will be clear within a few days. Although the government's failure is manifested in the military, the real failure lies in politics. In the future, it must compete with the Communist Party politically in order to reverse the current precarious situation. He believes that if the government can truly realize the Three Principles of the People, the result of the competition will definitely be the victory of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<h3>Xue Yue Hires Chen Jitang and Others as Senior Advisors to Guangdong Province</h3>

After the banquet, Yan had another conversation with Acting President Li to exchange opinions on the current situation. Then, Yan left Nanjing by plane, with few knowing beforehand. It is difficult to ascertain whether he flew back to Taiyuan or went elsewhere. Since arriving in Nanjing, Yan has been in frequent contact with various senior officials. He returned late on the 15th and had a long talk with Xu Yongchang for two hours, only going to bed at 3 a.m. on the 16th.

<h3>Location of the Legislative Yuan Resuming Session Undetermined; Chen Kewen Says It Depends on the Development of the Situation; Legislators Remaining in Guangzhou Advocate Voting to Decide</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Chen Kewen, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, went to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guilin, and other places to exchange opinions with legislators on the date and location of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of session, and flew back to Nanjing from Guilin on an Air Transport Team plane at about 4 p.m. on the 16th. According to Chen's statement to reporters, as a result of exchanging opinions with legislators in Guangzhou, Guilin, and other places, the legislators have made detailed discussions and considerations regarding the date and location of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of session. About 80 legislators remaining in Guangzhou mostly advocate resuming the session in Guangzhou, and the majority of the 41 legislators remaining in Guilin also advocate resuming the session in Guangzhou. These majority of legislators fled Nanjing during the tense and chaotic situation in the capital and generally believe that the situation in the capital is no longer suitable for the Legislative Yuan to convene. However, the future location of the resumption of session will still depend on the situation in the capital and the evolution of the current situation. The Guangzhou side has made appropriate arrangements for the address of the Legislative Yuan and the residences of the legislators and can be used for the Legislative Yuan to convene at any time. As for the means of transportation for the Legislative Yuan's resumption of session in the future, the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan will also find ways to provide it. Whether in Nanjing or Guangzhou, the Secretariat will be responsible. Regarding the date of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of session, Chen said that it must resume before February 28th according to law, and the location will be determined after President Tong of the Yuan returns to Nanjing and synthesizes the opinions of legislators from various regions.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 16th] The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan is currently preparing for the next plenary session of the Yuan to be held in Nanjing. The Administrative Affairs Section of the Secretariat is in the process of renting various guest houses of the Lishi Society as dormitories for legislators. The section is also inspecting old public buses and purchasing gasoline for the needs of legislators traveling back and forth. In fact, the Legislative Yuan will inevitably resume its session in Nanjing, rather than convening in Guangzhou. Seven legislators from Guangdong have arrived here to participate, and it is said that more will come to Nanjing soon. This breaks the previous rumor that the Guangdong legislators unanimously advocated resuming the session in Guangzhou. In addition, some legislators from Hunan have also returned here to attend. According to legislators in Shanghai, the session is scheduled for the 25th of this month.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 16th] It is reported that as a result of Sun Ke's discussion with the legislators remaining in Guangzhou yesterday, it was decided to ask the legislators remaining in Guangzhou to send two representatives to Guangzhou in the short term to invite legislators from Guilin, Taiwan, Sichuan, Henan, and other places to discuss the issue of resuming the session in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] The legislators remaining in Guangzhou held a meeting at the Guangzhou City Guest House on the afternoon of the 15th to discuss the location of the resumption of session and passed a telegram to President Tong Guanxian of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, advocating a vote to decide. The original telegram read: Tong Guanxian, President of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, and all members in Nanjing: Regarding the location of the third session of the Yuan, reports indicate that the opinions of colleagues in various places are inconsistent, with some advocating resuming the session in Guangzhou, some advocating in Nanjing, and some advocating resuming in Nanjing and then adjourning to consider moving to Guangzhou. For this issue, colleagues in Guangzhou convened a meeting on the 15th and agreed that at the beginning of the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou, colleagues remaining in Nanjing and Shanghai held a symposium and also decided to move south, and Vice President Liu and Deputy Secretary-General Yan came to Guangzhou to prepare for the resumption of session. Currently, the staff have arrived in Guangzhou. In view of the seriousness of the current situation and the need for continued efforts in peace talks, convening in Guangzhou is most appropriate. However, since the opinions of colleagues in various places are divergent, it is necessary to discuss it at length in order to show the spirit of unity of the Yuan. If the discussions fail to reach a consensus, then the members in various places should vote to express the decision of the whole body. If a certain region convenes a meeting abruptly with more than one-fifth of the members, it will inevitably cause disputes, which will not only not help the current difficulties but even delay national affairs. This is our humble opinion, and we ask you to convey it to the colleagues of the Yuan on our behalf. The spirit of unity that you promoted when you visited Guangzhou a decade ago is deeply admired by our colleagues, and we believe that you will be able to communicate with all parties to obtain a unanimous opinion on this issue. We especially hope that you and your colleagues in Nanjing and Shanghai will jointly decide and come south together as soon as possible. We respectfully send this telegram and hope for a reply. The legislators remaining in Guangzhou bow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] After more than 200 staff members of the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan arrived in Guangzhou, they have formally started working and are actively carrying out their work. They have also specially established a service section to receive legislators arriving in Guangzhou. The food and lodging of the legislators have been resolved. The Executive Yuan has specially allocated the dormitories of the Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank, as well as the Phoenix, Guangdong East, and West Hao Hotels as residences for legislators, which can accommodate 300 legislators with families (two rooms per family) and 500 single legislators (one room for two people). Meals have also been contracted with a special chef responsible for them. Legislators from various places have been arriving in Guangzhou one after another in recent days. Yesterday, Hou Tingdu, Peng Chunda, Yu Shilian, and others flew from Nanchang.</p>
<h3>The Capital's Curfew Time Shortened Starting Last Night</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Acting President Li hosted a banquet for the heads of the capital's security agencies at the Fuhougang residence at noon on the 15th. Zhang Yaoming, Shan Yizhi, Chen Pei, Zhang Zhen, Wan Jianfan, Huang Zhenwu, and others attended. During the banquet, Acting President Li personally instructed Commander-in-Chief Zhang and others that, due to the consolidation of the capital's security, the strength of the national army's river defense, and the retreat of the main Communist forces north of the Yangtze River, the curfew time could be moved back one hour, that is, the curfew would start at 12 midnight every night and end at 5 a.m. the next morning. Zhang and others, after receiving the order, began to implement it on the evening of the 16th.</p>
<h3>The South China Civil Defense Headquarters Officially Established in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 16th] The South China Civil Defense Headquarters was officially established on the 16th, with Director Yu Hanmou of the Pacification Headquarters concurrently serving as the commander, and Chen Duqi, Huang Guoliang, and Wu Lisan serving as deputy commanders. The main tasks of the headquarters are: (1) to strengthen air defense work in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces; (2) to collect intelligence for use by the army, navy, and air force; (3) to increase citizens' knowledge of air defense; and to establish air defense offices in Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan Island, and other regions in the future.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollars Will Be Allowed to Circulate; Gold and Foreign Exchange May Be Freely Traded; Finance Minister Xu Presided Over Important Meetings in Shanghai All Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Finance Minister Xu Kan presided over important meetings at his residence on Yuyuan Road all day yesterday. It is said that responsible persons from national banks and leading figures in the city's financial circles participated. Liu Gongyun, Governor of the Central Bank, also took time to meet with American friends. The contents were kept strictly secret. Officials completely deny the talk of issuing silver dollars, but in order to maintain the unity of the national currency system and prevent the emergence of various local currencies, the financial authorities may allow the legal circulation of silver dollars among the people, with the Central Bank posting the price daily, stipulating the linkage with the gold yuan, and allowing banks to accept deposits and withdrawals. In addition, gold and foreign exchange will also be publicly and freely traded. Due to the failure of the "August 19" currency reform, the authorities no longer dare to engage in currency reform rashly, and the silver dollars in stock may be insufficient to meet the needs of the whole country. Therefore, this method of devaluation may be adopted to maintain the credit of the gold yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 15th] Finance Minister Xu Kan personally took the financial and economic reform plan to Shanghai and has been extensively exchanging views with the financial community in Shanghai in recent days. He will make a final decision after going to Nanjing and is expected to return to Guangzhou around the 18th.</p>
<h3>Exploring American Views on the Situation in China; Gu Weijun Meets with Acheson; Also Discusses the Issue of Aid to China, but No Resolution</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said on the 15th that the Chinese government "does not want a peace that endangers freedom." After holding a brief meeting with Secretary of State Acheson, Gu told reporters that the meeting was intended to "explore the American government's views on the situation in China."</p>
<p>Gu also said that when the vast majority of people are eager to see peace, he made it clear that the peace they want is a peace of freedom and the preservation of national independence, under which their political rights can be protected, and not a peace under any conditions or a peace that endangers freedom.</p>
<p>Gu also frankly stated that he had not "seen any decisive progress in the peace talks between the Nationalists and the Communists."</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu concluded by saying that he and Acheson had discussed the issue of new American military aid to China, but there was "no resolution."</p>
<h3>American Republican Congressmen Demand a Re-examination of China Policy; Communist Victory in China is a Failure for the United States</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 15th] Fifty-one Republican Congressmen have recently requested that a committee composed mainly of senior military, political, and economic advisors prepare a report on the situation in China. The Congressmen stated that a Communist victory in China would be a permanent and historical failure for the United States and a serious threat to national security. In a letter to President Truman released tonight, the Congressmen recommended the establishment of such a committee and raised seven questions to clarify the US policy toward China. Of the signatories, seven are members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and several others have made many contributions in the past when the House considered foreign relations. Since last year's election campaign, several Republican spokesmen have repeatedly called for the United States to increase aid to the Nationalist government in China. Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee who signed the letter included Locke, Smith, Jackson, Moor, Jude, and Bolton. Other signatories included Hurd, Chairman of the House Special Committee on Foreign Aid of the 80th Congress, Witzworth, Anderson, and Keeffe.</p>
<p>The letter strongly criticized the US policy toward China, stating that the United States had tried to seek a union between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the result was "extremely harmful." The letter pointed out that Czechoslovakia had "dramatically demonstrated" the danger of this policy, with Czechoslovakia being "dragged behind the Iron Curtain" through its coalition government.</p>
<p>The letter further stated: The Chinese Communist Party seems to have reached the verge of victory. The signatories believe that the CCP's victory will not only pose a serious threat to the United States but also mean "the failure of the forces of freedom." The letter then asked the President questions about the current US policy toward China and asked whether there were plans to change the policy toward China. In addition, the letter asked what stance the United States would take if the government planned to support Chinese anti-communists (such as the Kuomintang) when they raise the issue of Communist aggression as a threat to peace at the United Nations. The letter also asked: If the United States has fulfilled its obligations to China under the Cairo and Yalta agreements, what steps will the United States take to guide the Soviet Union to comply with its obligations to China under the treaties concluded after the Yalta Conference? The letter then recommended the establishment of a committee to re-examine the entire situation and report its findings to the President and Congress.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Communist Radio Station in Northern Shaanxi Broadcasts the List of "War Criminals" and Will Increase to More Than 100</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 16th Broadcasting: Hopes for peace talks in China among Americans here have gradually diminished. It is reported that the Chinese Communist radio station in northern Shaanxi has recently emphasized that Li Zongren's call for peace is a hypocritical peace offensive and accused the National Army of actively preparing for war. It is generally believed that this propaganda offensive by the Chinese Communists, combined with the frequent mobilization of Communist troops in various places, may become a prelude to military action. In today's broadcast, the Chinese Communist radio station in northern Shaanxi vehemently criticized the Kuomintang for having changed from calling for peace to calling for war. The Chinese Communists cited a special official propaganda instruction from the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department and rebutted it, emphasizing the importance of arresting war criminals and declaring that "the Chinese Communist Party is still soliciting opinions from various democratic parties and people's organizations regarding the list of war criminals." The 43 war criminals announced on December 25th last year are still insufficient and will be increased to one hundred and several tens.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Political Reform Must Be Delivered!</h3>
<p>Acting President Li, in his broadcast the night before last, said: strive for peace, reform politics, especially focusing on the reform of politics, and rectify officialdom and military discipline. This is truly what everyone wants to say at this moment!</p>
<p>Since President Chiang issued his New Year's Day message to sincerely seek peace, the hope for peace has been dim and bright, intermittent, but still, there is some hope. However, speaking of politics, the situation in officialdom in the past month and a half has been truly outrageous! The war on the north bank of the Yangtze River has not yet moved to the riverbank, but the high-ranking officials in Nanjing have already been scrambling to move. Not to mention the chaotic order at train stations, wharves, and airports, even the offices of various ministries are in a mess. It is no wonder that a government like this is subject to ridicule from the Communist Party's broadcasts! If a major decision is not made immediately to thoroughly reform, not to mention being unable to fight again, even the attempt to seek peace may be impossible. Grieving over the daily deterioration of national affairs, we have long pointed out that if high-ranking government officials cannot have a profound awakening, wash their hearts and reform, then they can only surrender and be tried. How can they speak extravagantly of peace, let alone fantasize about war? Until the night before last, Acting President Li could not help but speak the honest words that hit the current ills.</p>
<p>Acting President Li said: "Our government must complete two tasks that are urgently demanded by the people of the whole country: the first is to seek peace, and the second is to reform politics. Regarding the latter, it is to rectify officialdom and military discipline, in other words, to start with the reform of the mentality and behavior of military and government personnel throughout the country." Finally, he also said: "Although the two decisions of the government to seek peace and reform politics have different targets, their purpose is the same, which is based on the supreme principle of following the will of the people and relieving the suffering of the people." This statement not only expresses what the people of the whole country have been pressing in their hearts to say but have not been able to fully say, but also is the current goal of the government itself. Whether to seek peace with the CCP or continue to fight, reforming politics to alleviate the suffering of the people is a prerequisite for success. However, the government authorities have been shouting the slogan of "reform" for a long time. No matter how high the tune is sung, the corruption and incompetence of politics remain the same, and there is a feeling that it is getting worse. Therefore, we hope that Acting President Li will not stop at broadcasting, merely talking emptily about political reform, but should change the past style of "new eight-legged essays" that Party members are accustomed to doing, and earnestly take further steps to deliver on what he says. If the people of the country can see that Acting President Li's political reforms are not empty promises, but can truly achieve "disregarding all difficulties, eliminating all obstacles, and striving to achieve the goal," then the government can rebuild its prestige, and then it can talk about other things.</p>
<p>Regarding our country's politics in recent years, there is a consensus at home and abroad that the malady lies in corruption and incompetence. Even the highest Party authorities bearing heavy responsibilities cannot deny it, and they have also repeatedly tried to reform it. However, after reforming and reforming, there is still no sign of a new look. Where is the crux? Obviously, it lies in the disconnection between the government and the people. Those in power in the government have always been looking for people only in a few circles of new and old bureaucrats, always only trying to perfunctorily cope with the situation and seek solutions in a routine manner, without seeing the people, without thinking of the people, and without selecting true talent from the vast number of people! To be honest, most of the civil servants below the middle level can be law-abiding, honest, and self-respecting. Even under the pressure of high prices, they do not have enough food and clothing, but they can still work on an empty stomach. Of course, there are also many who punch the clock and do nothing, wasting the national treasury, but the arduous lives of most civil servants are not only worthy of our sympathy but also very worthy of admiration. They are definitely not the targets of political reform. If there are good people leading this large group of civil servants, they can work hard. As for the so-called corrupt and incompetent officials, only a small part of them are mixed in, doing evil, using the convenience of their positions, engaging in private interests at public expense, and doing everything. As long as this small portion of scum, this small portion of parasitic elements can be cleared away, politics can be expected to be clear immediately.</p>
<p>However, these corrupt officials who engage in private interests and fraud all have backers who they rely on without fear. If the government authorities cannot make a painful decision, break through personal relationships, and do things impartially, these scum in the government will definitely still be impossible to clear away. Not only will they be impossible to clear away, but one person will attain enlightenment, and even his dogs and chickens will ascend to heaven. There will inevitably be more and more of them. Even if you shout loudly for political reform, political corruption and incompetence will remain the same. Therefore, we hope that when Acting President Li reforms politics, first, he must see the targets clearly, and also use the methods of "capturing the bandits capture the king" and "killing one to warn a hundred," and start by severely punishing a few corrupt officials who have powerful backers. Expose the government's "velvet curtain," welcome people to report corruption, and make it impossible for them to mix in the government again. Second, he must have a spirit of impartiality. "If the law is not enforced, it is because those above violate it." "Execute justice on your own wife, and then extend it to the state." These words are all the clear instructions of ancient sages. If Acting President Li wants to eliminate all corrupt elements and can start with his close confidants to create a new political style of iron-faced ruthlessness, that will surely give people a new look at home and abroad. Even the CCP will have to re-evaluate the government with a different eye.</p>
<p>After eight years of resistance war and three years of internal strife, the Chinese people have suffered enough. In addition, they have been exploited and plundered by corrupt officials. Now, they are truly suffering from a life that cannot be lived. Abandoning war and seeking peace is what everyone desires, but judging from the recent situation, peace will not be achieved overnight. During the transition period, we ordinary people can only hope that the government will quickly reform politics to alleviate the suffering of the people. Now that Acting President Li is determined to reform politics, it can be said that he understands the people. We hope that he will be decisive, practice what he preaches, and use facts to make his check for political reform able to be cashed.</p>

<h3>Looking at the New Situation in Central China</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 12th dispatch] It should be spring, but it is difficult to hear any news of spring in various parts of Central China. If spring symbolizes peace, this season is clearly abnormal. In addition, in the past three or four days, there have been two heavy snowfalls here, which makes people feel like "traveling in winter during spring," realizing that the lovely spring is still lingering at the final moment of war and peace, and people can't help but feel a bit depressed!</p>
<p>Minor Ailments Are Not a Cause for Concern</p>
<p>People with a little military geography knowledge have all sweated for Central China, but today, with the withdrawal from Xuzhou-Bengbu and the flames of war approaching the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, because the National Army's air and sea control may exert due power on the Yangtze River blockade line 300 miles upstream and 500 miles downstream, in coordination with the land army on the front line of the river defense, because the Communist army's strength, tools, and methods of dealing with sky and water attacks in various parts of East and Central China are still insufficient, it shows that in modern three-dimensional warfare, this area has gained extremely large advantages in time and space, turning the ancient geographically advantageous situation for attack into a flexible position suitable for both attack and defense. Today's Central China has its head resting on Sichuan and Chongqing, its feet straddling Anhui and Jiangxi, its left arm controlling Shaanxi and Henan, and its right arm relying on Hunan. Moreover, in the core of the three towns of Wuhan and its surroundings, where its head is located in Shashi and Yichang, its feet are located in Anqing and Jiujiang, and its left and right arms control the Ping-Han and Yue-Han lines, it has preserved 600,000 troops sufficient to cope with any attacks from southern Henan, eastern Hubei, central Hubei, northern Hubei, or northern Anhui. Ten days ago, the turnaround in southern Henan, as well as the authorities' recent calm stabilization of the battle situation in Shashi and Yichang on the north bank of the Yangtze River, can prove that if the Communist army cannot concentrate 300,000 troops in the plains of Jiang (north bank of the Yangtze River), Han (both banks of the Han River), He (both banks of the Xiang River) and southern Henan, as well as Dabie, Dahong, Tongbai, and the Three Mountains, it cannot expect to succeed in any of the above areas. So I say: The few annoying minor ailments in Central China now are not a cause for concern.</p>
<p>Military and Civilians in Various Places Are Raising Their Vigilance</p>
<p>Although the situation in Central China is changing day by day, human factors are also worth discussing. Bai Jiansheng, a general of the Central China military authorities, this brilliant military expert with a wealth of intelligence, is also very meticulous in his thinking. Since he arrived in Central China, he has indeed done several things. As large as the land problem of limiting land and granting land, as small as the atmosphere of Hankou Wharf, he can order the relevant departments to supervise and improve with a far-sighted vision. The recent Hankou decision to subsidize soldiers and police with one silver yuan for non-staple food expenses starting in February is particularly timely because in the past, each soldier's non-staple food expenses were only 1.5 yuan in Gold Yuan currency per day, which was not enough to buy even two ounces of cabbage, which was really miserable. The recent execution in Hankou of a rice robber and a financial disturber who sold silver yuan has had the expected effect of stabilizing the value of Central China's currency and is also very popular. This is an excellent remedy for seeking stability in progress. Now the military and civilians in various parts of Central China seem to have raised their vigilance regarding the future development of the situation, especially the officers and soldiers in the military. Each of them had hoped for peace with a sad heart, hoping to disarm and return to their hometown to be a peaceful civilian. Unexpectedly, the other side is so aggressive. Under the pressing situation, they have felt disappointed, and it seems that they have turned fear into hatred, and hatred has given them strength. This is a human instinct. Some gentry in Wuhan said: For the CCP's sake, peace is also the most valuable thing, because during the Long March of 25,000 li by the Communist army in the 24th and 25th years of the Republic, that leg strength was fueled by hatred.</p>
<p>Southern Henan and Central Hubei Are Full of Woe</p>
<p>There are especially many grieving soldiers in the Central China National Army units, and their fighting will is becoming stronger day by day. A grieving army is bound to win, as seen in ancient precepts. Moreover, most of the officers here are so poor that they have no money to wash their clothes. This phenomenon is also clearly different from the situation on the eastern front. To give an example, when Que mountain and Xinyang in Southern Henan were undergoing a major change of defense during the old lunar New Year's Eve, although the soldiers moving south from Que mountain and Xin yang were like a big moving yard, the scene was not too gorgeous. However, in an instant, the large army moving north, such as Zhang Gan's corps, formed a fighting body with officers and soldiers lightly loaded and rushed straight forward. When the people of Southern Henan saw this momentum, they were relieved, and those local Communists from the Northeast, posing as Chen and Liu's forces, finally fled at the first sign of trouble under the guidance of some speculative meeting officials and inferior gentry. As a result, Southern Henan turned from danger to safety, and everyone was busy with rehabilitation. In addition, similar phenomena have recently been discovered near Jingmen and Dangyang in Central Hubei, as well as in Shashi and Yichang. It seems that the National Army still needs to make greater efforts in handling intelligence, because although the minor ailments in Central China are not a major concern, the people in many places in Southern Henan and Central Hubei have been dying in despair during the harassment of the rogue-type local Communists.</p>

<h3>Acheson Dismisses Rumors Circulating in Tokyo About the United States Withdrawing from Japan as Absurd; Australian United Press Claims the Information Was Actually Disclosed by Royall Himself</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Washington, 16th (Broadcast): Acheson stated at a press conference that the rumors circulating in Tokyo regarding US policy toward Japan were completely unfounded and that the United States had not considered changing its Far East policy. When reporters pressed Acheson to explain the rumors circulating in Tokyo and the specific policies the United States would adopt, Acheson replied that such matters were very annoying. He stated that reporters were forcing officials to make denials while continuing to discuss the issue. He was unwilling to discuss the matter at that time.</p>
<p>Before the press conference concluded, Acheson asked reporters to specify the rumors to which they were referring. The reporters replied that they were referring to the following three points: (1) The United States would withdraw from Japan in the event of war; (2) Japan was indefensible; (3) The United States had no moral obligation to Japan other than to cover occupation costs. Acheson stated that he would only address the first two points but declined to comment on the third.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 16th (Broadcast): Sydney Dispatch: Today, Australian newspapers published a dispatch from the Australian United Press stating that the remarks made by a certain American dignitary in Tokyo, reported by American journalists stationed there, regarding the potential withdrawal of US troops from Japan in the event of a US-Soviet war, were actually made by US Secretary of the Army Royall. Royall held a secret press conference at the US Embassy in Japan. The bureau chiefs of the Associated Press, United Press, International News Service, and reporters from the New York Times, Chicago Daily News, and Christian Science Monitor were all present. Royall stated in the most candid terms that if this decision were known to Australia or the Philippines, "they would be screaming." He instructed reporters not to disclose that the information came from him. The director of the Allied General Headquarters' press department was not invited to the press conference, which was considered unusual by the reporters. Royall also revealed that the withdrawal of US troops from Japan was under consideration by the military.</p>
<h3>Austrian Peace Treaty Negotiations at a Stalemate</h3>
<p>Four Powers Hold Behind-the-Scenes Meetings</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th] Representatives of the four powers hastily held several behind-the-scenes meetings on the 16th in an attempt to break the deadlock between the East and West regarding the Austrian peace treaty. The representatives refused to disclose the details of the meetings, stating only that these meetings were more crucial than the formal exchanges of views in the four-power meetings. US Representative Reber consulted with Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber last night and planned to hold a second meeting with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Bebler within the next 36 hours. Yugoslavia's demands on Austria are the main obstacle in the Austrian peace treaty conference. Reber declined to comment on the possibility of mediating the differences between Yugoslavia and Austria.</p>
<h3>Nine Countries to Participate in European Parliament</h3>
<p>Headquarters to be Located in Strasbourg</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th] Nine countries agreed on the 16th to participate in the proposed European Parliament, with its "capital" located in Strasbourg, France, near the German border. A spokesman for the Danish Foreign Ministry declared in Copenhagen that Denmark was prepared to accept the invitation and join the parliament. The other participating countries will be Sweden, Italy, Northern Ireland, and the five countries of the Western European Union. According to informed sources, the Western European Union countries have agreed that Strasbourg should be the headquarters of the European Parliament.</p>
<h3>British Defense Budget</h3>
<p>Totaling £759.86 Million; Radar Network to be Built in Western Europe</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th] The plan for a joint radar defense wall in Western Europe is included in the British defense budget of £759.86 million for 1949-1950. A British government white paper revealed on the 16th that Marshal Montgomery, Chief of Staff of Western European Union Defense, had drafted a specific plan for an air raid warning network for Western European Union members. No further details were released. Although British defense spending increased by £107.5 million, the number of men and women in the army, navy, and air force will be reduced by 43,000 this year. The plan advocates for a total military force of 750,000 personnel.</p>
<h3>Churchill Calls for Military Recruitment to Strengthen the Army's Strength</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 15th] Churchill called for military recruitment on the 15th to strengthen the British Army's strength "in these dangerous times." In a broadcast on the London Broadcasting Company, Churchill endorsed the government's military recruitment plan. He urged every British citizen to "do their job and do a little more" by voluntarily participating in part-time service in the local military.</p>
<h3>North Atlantic Security Treaty Negotiations Reach Critical Stage; US Unwillingness to Assume Military Obligations is the Biggest Obstacle</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] Diplomatic and congressional figures recently pointed out that negotiations on the North Atlantic Treaty have entered the most critical stage. These well-informed sources suggested that negotiations, originally scheduled to be completed by the beginning of next month, may be delayed due to disagreements over the extent to which the United States should be obligated to assist Western European countries in resisting aggression.</p>
<p>Some congressmen expressed concern that the wording of the current draft could be interpreted too broadly. However, some European diplomats claimed that the current draft was insufficient in guaranteeing that participating countries would resist armed aggression.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Acheson was asked at a press conference about Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally's assertion that the United States should not be bound when deciding whether to aid any attacked European country. Diplomats fear that any further weakening of the North Atlantic Treaty could make it unacceptable to some European countries. If Connally's suggestion is adopted, the treaty would be weaker than the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1947. In the Rio Treaty, participating countries recognized an attack on any one country as an attack on all and stipulated that each country has the obligation to "assist in meeting the attack," with actions short of the use of force executable upon a two-thirds vote of the participating countries.</p>
<h3>Connally Issues Second Statement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally's statement yesterday opposing the North Atlantic Treaty's imposition of an automatic obligation on the United States to enter the war has caused an uproar in foreign countries. Connally issued a second statement today stating that while the treaty need not stipulate that the United States must automatically send troops to assist if a signatory country in Europe is attacked, the United States can guarantee to "take certain necessary measures to maintain the security of the North Atlantic area," so as not to conflict with the US Constitution and reassure European countries. The Senate is scheduled to discuss the matter next Monday.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Foreign Minister Returns Home After Gaining British Understanding</h3>
<p>Norway to Reject Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 16th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange returned home by plane this morning. His negotiations with British authorities in recent days have proven very satisfactory. Before leaving Britain, Lange stated, "I can confidently say that Britain and Norway now understand each other quite well."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] According to informed sources, the Norwegian government, after the Foreign Minister's return, will likely respond to the Soviet Union's proposal by the end of this weekend, rejecting the conclusion of a non-aggression pact.</p>
<h3>US Art Association Announces World's Top Ten Beauties</h3>
<p>Soong Mei-ling Selected for Her Well-Proportioned Nose</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 16th] The American Art Association today announced the list of "World's Top Ten Beauties" as follows: Forehead - Duchess of Windsor, Nose - Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Soong Mei-ling), Eyes - Princess Margaret of Great Britain, Lips - Movie Star Rita Hayworth, Ears - Margaret Truman, daughter of President Truman, Cheekbones - Movie Star Ginger Rogers, Jaw - Model Candy Jones, Shoulders - Singer Marguerite Piazza, Thighs - Actress Esther Williams, Calves - Actress Linda Darnell. According to the association's secretary-general, Kona, the election was conducted by member voting, including many famous American artists. The more even the nose, the more beautiful. Madame Chiang's nose is in perfect harmony with the rest of her face, hence her selection.</p>
<h3>Security Council Discusses South Korea's Membership Application; Soviet Representative Strongly Opposes; Final Resolution Refers it Back to the Membership Committee for Re-Examination</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 15th] The United Nations Security Council, amidst strong Soviet opposition on the 15th, referred South Korea's application for membership to the Membership Committee for review. Soviet Representative Malik opposed considering South Korea's application, accusing the South Korean government of being "merely a local branch of the US occupation authorities" and claiming that the application for membership "amounts to an insult to the Korean people." The Security Council voted nine to two to overrule Malik's objection and referred the application to the Membership Committee, composed of representatives from the eleven Security Council members. Given Malik's open attacks on the US-backed South Korean government, the Soviet Union will likely use its thirtieth veto when the Membership Committee makes its recommendation in the future. US Representative Austin opposed the application for membership from the Soviet-backed North Korean government.</p>

<h3>Railway Workers' Strike Expands; Six Thousand Workers Petition; Military Police Blockade Zhenru; Worker Representatives Arrive in Shanghai for Negotiations, But No Results Yet</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The railway workers' strike in the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) region suddenly expanded yesterday, causing trains on both the Jinghu and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) lines to be suspended throughout the day. Approximately six thousand workers from the Qichang Locomotive Factory, Changzhou Carriage Repair Shop, and stations in Wuxi, Suzhou, and other locations took special trains to Shanghai to petition. Upon hearing the news, the city's public security authorities dispatched a large number of military police to intercept them along the railway and temporarily detonated a small section of the tracks. The workers' petition train was ultimately blocked near Yangjiaqiao in Zhenru (3.5 kilometers from Zhenru Station). After much persuasion, the workers sent over forty representatives from various units to Shanghai to negotiate with the railway bureau on the issue of compensation. The petition train returned to Nanxiang Station. As of 11:00 PM, there were still no results from the negotiations. It is unlikely that trains on both lines will return to normal today.</p>
<p>The local workers from the two railway bureaus had previously gone on strike to petition on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (14th) due to dissatisfaction with the new compensation announced by the railway bureau. After Director Wang promised that the compensation for employees would be handled the same way as the telecommunications bureau and immediately issued 5,000 yuan per person, the workers resumed work that evening. However, while petitioning, the local workers in Shanghai had notified the Qichang factory workers by telephone. Upon receiving the news, the Qichang factory responded by dispatching a special train at 5:00 PM on that day (15th) to join the petition in Shanghai. Upon receiving the news, the railway bureau ordered station masters along the route to dissuade the train from proceeding and dispatched Deputy Director and Chief of the Mechanical Department Chen Fuhai to persuade them. Chen arrived at Wuxi Station yesterday morning, and the petition train had already arrived in Wuxi. The crowd of workers immediately surrounded Chen and made three demands: (1) Immediately issue evacuation expenses of two shi (a unit of dry measure) of rice per person, (2) Supplement the double salary for January as newly announced by the Executive Yuan, (3) The minimum salary should be two shi of rice for workers, four shi for foremen, and three and a half shi for technicians. Although Chen explained that the workers in Shanghai had already resumed work, and Director Wang had agreed to handle compensation in the same way as the telecommunications bureau and immediately issue 5,000 yuan, it was to no avail. The crowd still insisted on coming to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hijacking Station Masters Along the Route to Serve as "Human Hostage Passes"</h3>
<p>At approximately 1:00 PM, the crowd hijacked Deputy Director Chen and Wuxi Station Master Zhang Mutao onto the train to serve as passes. (According to regulations, trains cannot proceed without a pass issued by the station master). Other station masters, such as Lin Xiaojin from Changzhou Station and He Zhihua from Nanxiang Station, were also invited onto the train to serve as "human hostage passes." Upon receiving the report, Tang Enbo, Commander of the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, was furious. He believed that if workers had demands for improved compensation, they could send representatives to negotiate with the railway bureau. He considered gathering a crowd to petition a violation of martial law and ordered the military police along the route to prevent the train from coming to Shanghai. The traffic police stationed in Changzhou, Shitouwan, Wuxi, Suzhou, Waikuatang, Kunshan, and other locations were unable to prevent the train from proceeding, even after firing warning shots.</p>
<p>Troops Mobilized; Deploying Defense Along the Route</p>
<p>The situation became increasingly tense as the train passed through Suzhou. The city's public security authorities mobilized a large number of military police to protect the North Railway Station and the Railway Bureau. Temporary martial law was declared in the Qiujiang Road area. At the same time, officers and soldiers from the 2nd Battalion of the 52nd Army, carrying all combat equipment, were dispatched to the vicinity of Yangjiaqiao, west of Zhenru, to deploy defense along the railway. Commander Tang also sent Chief of Staff Cao Ruzhen to be stationed at the Railway Bureau to be responsible for handling security issues caused by the labor unrest. He Longqing, Director of the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Huang Zhiyuan, Director of the Unified Investigation Office, Qian Hegao, Director of the Police Department of the Railway Bureau, Zhang Yunhe, Commissioner of the Employee Welfare Association of the Railway Bureau, Li Dasan, Chairman of the Special Branch of the Two Lines, Gao Qifu and Yuan Qiaofu, Directors of the Labor Union, and other military police personnel, along with a large number of railway police, mobile units, and guard battalions, rushed to Zhenru at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Detonating Railway Tracks to Stop the Train</p>
<p>Reporters and others accompanied them. After passing Zhenru Station and traveling about one kilometer westward, billowing white smoke could be seen in the distance at the end of the railway. The petition train could already be seen. Director He Longqing, considering the urgency of the situation, did not have time to find track workers to remove the rails, so he ordered two grenades to be used to detonate a small section of the tracks. Soldiers from the 52nd Army dispersed and lay prone in the trenches, preparing to fire live ammunition if the workers disobeyed orders. Five armored vehicles from the Special Operations Battalion of the Garrison Headquarters, led by Deputy Battalion Commander Huang Rongwu, also arrived at this time. The train driver, seeing the red flags and the military's defensive posture, had no choice but to stop the train and await orders. Deputy Regiment Commander Li of the 52nd Army immediately sent troops to the locomotive to monitor it and rescued Deputy Director Chen, who had been placed on the front of the train as a "bulletproof shield" by the workers.</p>
<p>Accepting Persuasion and Returning to Nanxiang</p>
<p>He Longqing, Qian Hegao, Chairman Li, and the Labor Union Directors gathered the worker representatives next to the train to give a speech, persuading them to prioritize social order and transportation. They asked all the workers to temporarily return to Nanxiang and have the representatives from each unit come to Shanghai to negotiate compensation with the railway bureau directors. After repeated persuasion, at 7:15 PM, the workers agreed to have a locomotive push the attached twenty-eight covered freight cars back to Nanxiang. Another locomotive came to Shanghai to refuel (the workers' train had a rescue vehicle attached, which was used to repair the detonated tracks). After hearing the news of the arrival of the workers from the Changzhou Qichang factory in Shanghai, the workers in Shanghai also urgently gathered over one thousand four hundred workers and took a special train to welcome them. The train was surrounded by the military at Zhenru Station. After hearing that the workers coming to Shanghai had returned, they also returned to Shanghai. Upon learning that the workers who had come to Shanghai to petition had not eaten for a day and a night, the General Affairs Office of the Railway Bureau temporarily collected 300,000 yuan and purchased fried dough sticks, large flatbreads, steamed buns, biscuits, and other food items to send to Nanxiang to distribute to the petitioning employees to fill their stomachs. The railway bureau hosted a dinner for the forty-odd worker representatives. A large number of troops and armored vehicles remained stationed around the station and the Railway Bureau, and had not been withdrawn as of late night.</p>
<h3>Passenger Trains Detained</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The overnight sleeper express train from Shanghai to Nanjing on the evening of the 15th and the express train that departed on the morning of the 16th were both detained after arriving at Qichang Station.

<h3>Garrison Commander's Remarks Analyzing the Types and Causes of Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Chen Daqing, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, commented on the recent frequent labor unrest in the city at his monthly press briefing yesterday, stating that labor unrest can be divided into four types: work slowdowns, strikes, gathering crowds to coerce, and riots and destruction. The causes are either economic, politically motivated disruptions, or factional struggles. Regarding work slowdowns and strikes, he believes that the labor union should cooperate with the Social Affairs Bureau to eliminate them before they occur or to properly resolve them after they occur. As for those who gather crowds to coerce and engage in riots and destruction, the Garrison Headquarters will severely crack down on them, and the leaders will be arrested and summarily executed on the spot. Those who are found to be masterminding politically motivated labor unrest behind the scenes will also be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Extortion Letters, Murder of Accomplice, Repeated Robberies – A Gang of Master Thieves Arrested One After Another</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] On the 6th of this month, the Xin Cheng Police Precinct received a tip-off that a gang of bandits was hiding in the Chedaijiao area of Huai'an Road, planning to carry out a robbery that evening. Section Chief Hao Jingyi instructed officers Liu Zhufeng, Dai Wende, Gong Shimin, Gao Changbiao, Gu Zhongyi, Wang Jizeng, and others to disguise themselves and go to the address. As expected, they captured bandits Zhang Agou and Cao Jiacheng in front of the No. 640 gate of the Fourth Textile Factory on that road. Two pistols were found on Zhang. After strict interrogation, they confessed that they were waiting for their accomplices to carry out a robbery. The officers then used a trick, ordering them to wait nearby. However, no accomplices appeared that night, so the two criminals were taken to the precinct for interrogation.</p>
<p>According to Zhang Agou's confession, the two pistols were given to him by his friend Chen Defa. He also revealed that Chen lived in Panjiawan, Zhabei. Detectives Jiao Guorui, Lu Yuheng, Wang Defu, Wang Wenxiang, and others were dispatched to escort the criminal to the address, and Chen was captured. He confessed that he had an accomplice named Zhu Jinquan, who lived in Kangjiaqiao, Kangding Road. The officers went to the Jiangning District Office to check the household registration, but only found Zhu Jingen, not Zhu Jinquan. Chen was then taken to the Household Registration Section of the General Bureau to identify the photograph on the household registration card, and he confirmed that Zhu Jingen was the same person as his accomplice Zhu Jinquan. Zhu was immediately arrested at No. 31, east of Jinsitu Temple, Kangding Road. Based on their confessions, bandit Huang Xianyi was captured at No. 826, Tokyo Road. The remaining fugitives are still at large. Combining the confessions of the various defendants, it was learned that they had committed nine crimes, including several robberies, the murder of their accomplice Ni Jianfu, and sending extortion letters to Mei Shaotang. The investigation of all the criminals has been completed and they will be handed over to the court for trial.</p>

They reiterated that the China Union Company should be fully responsible for the tragedy and appealed for several points: (1) Demand that the China Union Company promptly begin salvage operations. Even if it is believed that the time has passed for the bodies to be identifiable, they should be transported and buried in a common cemetery as a memorial and to alert the shipping industry. (2) Promptly allocate compensation of 100 shi of white rice per deceased passenger. (3) Retain the right to demand compensation for all losses in accordance with the law. (4) The China Union Company should currently provide each survivor with a temporary loan of 100,000 yuan for living expenses, which will be deducted from the loss compensation in the future. (5) Request the government to pay attention to the responsibility for this incident and to thoroughly investigate the corruption in maritime administration. The thousands of lives lost in the Jiangya and Taiping disasters should at least be exchanged for the authorities' determination to quickly reform maritime administration.</p>
<h3>City Buses Completely Cease Operations Yesterday – Mayor Orders Resumption of Service Today – Five Out of Six Demands Agreed To</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, employees of all bus routes of the Municipal Public Transportation Company went on strike because the company refused their request for each person to be given 6 shi of white rice as emergency expenses. Initially, employees at Fenglin Bridge learned that the company authorities had rejected their request and collectively did not dispatch any buses after breakfast. At the Fair Road maintenance yard, some buses initially departed, but they soon returned to the yard after learning the news, leading to a complete cessation of operations that continued into the evening without resumption. Mayor Wu was furious upon hearing the news and issued a handwritten order yesterday afternoon, demanding that all employees immediately resume work starting today. Those who failed to resume work would be dismissed. Wu also notified the Garrison Department and the Police Bureau to dispatch personnel to protect the company's two maintenance yards at Fenglin Bridge and Fair Road. However, the company's employees do not have a labor union organization, so there was no formal contact between the two sides after the strike began yesterday. According to the company, the workers' demands were: (1) Improve the salary payment method. (2) Improve the rotating rest system. (3) Request educational loans for children. (4) The same welfare benefits as the employees of the British and French tram companies. (5) The same food allowance as the employees of the British and French tram companies. (6) Issue 6 shi of rice as emergency expenses. It is now reported that the company has agreed to all except the sixth point.</p>
<h3>French Tram and Bus Services All Cease Operations at One Point</h3>
<p>Workers of Five Public Utilities Fight for Allowances</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Workers of the five major public utility companies in this city – the French-owned Water and Electricity, the American-owned Electricity, the British-owned Tram, Gas, and Waterworks – have been demanding additional welfare allowances for employee transportation and meals, but the matter has been delayed and unresolved. Yesterday morning, Shen Ding, the director of the Labor Department of the Bureau of Social Affairs, convened representatives of labor and management of the respective public utility companies for mediation. While discussions were still underway at noon, employees of the French Tram and Bus services misunderstood the delayed return of their representatives to report on the negotiations. At around 11:00 AM, trams and buses on various routes gradually returned to the depot or stopped operating after reaching their destinations. By afternoon, all transportation on the lines had completely ceased. After the Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Labor, Lu Jingshi, convened a joint mediation session, an agreement was reached in the evening, and operations resumed after 6:30 PM. However, because most of the employees had already returned home, very few vehicles were running. It is expected that operations will return to normal today.</p>
<h3>Agreements Reached with Three Companies, Negotiations Continue with Others</h3>
<p>Telephone company employees previously had poorer welfare benefits than other public utility companies. After negotiations, the company increased welfare allowances, with workers earning a base salary of 26 yuan receiving an allowance of 7 jiao 5 fen per day, and those with higher wages receiving progressively smaller allowances. After negotiations, the electricity company agreed to a maximum welfare allowance of 4 jiao 5 fen. After yesterday's mediation, the French Water and Electricity company also decided that those with a base salary of 30 yuan would receive a daily allowance of 7 jiao 1 fen, with the allowance decreasing by 1 fen for each additional yuan of base salary, up to a maximum of 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Welfare allowances for employees of the British-owned Gas, Waterworks, Tram, and other companies are also being studied and negotiated separately, and solutions are expected to be reached soon.</p>

<h3>Fire and Explosion at Jiangwan Armory – Extinguished the Same Evening; Fortunately No Casualties Among Officers and Soldiers – Deputy Depot Chief Detained for Investigation into Cause</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The second depot of the Fifth Armory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters on Guohua Road, Jiangwan, suddenly caught fire and exploded at 5:00 PM yesterday. The Fire Department and others rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which was quickly extinguished. However, the ammunition stored inside continued to explode sporadically late into the night. Details of casualties and losses were not yet available last night. The depot was originally a Japanese military barracks, built with wooden boards and lead sheets, and consisted of nine warehouses storing old and discarded ammunition seized from the Japanese army. In addition, there were several dormitories and offices. According to the depot chief, Duan Youkai, the fire started in the latrine next to the office, which housed a company of maintenance troops repairing artillery shells. After the fire broke out, it spread to the military supplies warehouse and nearby civilian residences and shacks. The general depot chief, Li Ruojun, immediately led personnel to rescue the situation, while simultaneously sending urgent telegrams to the Fire Department, Police Bureau, Garrison Department, and others. By the time the fire trucks arrived to put out the fire, it had already spread to the ammunition storage area and caused explosions. Fortunately, seven of the nine warehouses were a considerable distance from the fire source, so the losses were not significant after strenuous rescue efforts. One military supplies warehouse, one office, one kitchen, and over ten nearby civilian residences and shacks were destroyed. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, and the depot chief, Duan Youkai, has been detained by Chen Qian, the director of the Shanghai Supply Bureau, who is in charge of the armory. General Depot Chief Li Ruojun has been tasked with handling the aftermath. There are also 15 officers and 50 soldiers in the depot. The bureau was still investigating late at night whether there were any missing or injured personnel.</p>
<p>[Additional report] Director Chen of the Fire Department stated late last night that it has been confirmed that there were no casualties among the officers and soldiers at the armory. (Attached image shows firefighters holding torches and shining lights to spray water to extinguish the fire. Photographed by our newspaper.)</p>

<h3>Morning Friends Win the Cup – Hui Li Suffers Crushing Defeat by Three Points – Morning Friends Win the Championship in Thrilling Battle</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The final match of the Morning Friends Cup Basketball Championship, Morning Friends versus Hui Li, took place at the Municipal Gymnasium last night at 7:00 PM. Over a thousand spectators were present, creating a passionate and tense atmosphere. In the end, Morning Friends defeated Hui Li 45-42 in a hard-fought battle, winning the championship. Hui Li trailed by seven points at halftime, 23-16. Morning Friends used a strategy of using softness to overcome strength, with Wang Bowen putting on the most outstanding performance. Wang Rongsheng and He Zeng also played well. Hui Li was too eager to win, resulting in excessive tension. Cao Zhiji's prowess was undiminished, and Wang Yongfang and Tian Fuhai also displayed their shooting skills, but the overall performance was not as good as in the second game, leading to a crushing defeat by three points. In the friendly match, Jian Le faced the Kang team. The Kang team led by two points at halftime, 24-22, with a tight game situation. In the end, Jian Le reversed the defeat and won 42-38.</p>
<p>Close Contact on the Court – Difficult to Determine the Winner</p>
<p>The life-or-death battle of the Morning Friends Cup Group A Championship between the Morning Friends and Hui Li teams began at 7:05 PM. After contact, Wang Yongfang and Fu Qixia scored in succession, and Tian Fu added a free throw, putting Hui Li ahead 3-2. Morning Friends called a timeout. Lao Cao also made a free throw, and Ren Yu and Wang Bowen scored on free throws, tying the score at 5-5. Yun Quan and He Zeng added three points, putting Morning Friends ahead 8-5. Wei Xu and Bowen each scored for their respective teams, making it 11-7. Hui Li then reconsidered its strategy. Hui Li missed several free throws. Yongfang then tried a long shot and scored, closing the gap to 11-9. Cao Zhiji scored with a turnaround shot, tying the score at 11-11. Liang Xiong exchanged in for Shi Yunquan, causing the score to fluctuate. Bowen fought hard, giving Morning Friends a 20-13 advantage again. At halftime, Morning Friends led by seven points, 23-16.</p>
<p>Mixed Battle – Morning Friends Take the Lead</p>
<p>Prizes were awarded during the halftime break, presented by Mrs. Kang Jiwen. The championship team beamed with joy. The game restarted, becoming even more intense.

From then on, both sides showed their shooting skills, with the score increasing rapidly. With ten minutes remaining, the score was 33-27. Soon after, Zhang Pu replaced Wei Xu for Hui Li. Both sides fought in a mixed battle, making it difficult to make progress. Morning Friends still took the lead, but Hui Li also had poor ball luck, with the ball often circling around the basket. When Zhiji and Baokang scored, the score gradually closed to 38-34, still two points behind. Hui Li committed more fouls, giving the opponent opportunities to score free throws, which affected their morale and was a miscalculation. The score then separated again, 43-36. Morning Friends called its fifth timeout. Wei Xu scored from a distance, and Baokang committed a foul, replaced by Shang Chongyue. Zhiji also scored, but Morning Friends still won the championship 45-42.</p>

<h3>Gold Bond Prices Rise Again – Formal Listing and Trading Must Wait Until Early Next Month</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the quoted price for gold bonds was 66,250 yuan, an increase of 3,850 yuan compared to the previous day. Few retail sales were made, but securities exchange brokers collectively subscribed for a quantity that could reach 100 million yuan. As for the listing date for gold public bonds, external rumors vary. It has been learned from the National Bank that although the Securities Exchange Market is scheduled to reopen on February 21, the formal listing of gold public bonds will likely not become a reality until next month. This is because the Securities Exchange has been closed for a long time, and once it reopens, there will be many complex issues that will take time to resolve. Moreover, the current issuers of gold public bonds are reservation vouchers rather than formal bonds, which will cause difficulties when exchanging them in the future. Therefore, the listing and trading of gold public bonds will still take time.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit Situation Eases – Cash Remains Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city's credit situation eased as remittances from other ports arrived and wages were paid by industrial and commercial enterprises, providing a large supply of floating capital. However, due to turnover issues, the lending groups outside the industry still displayed a tendency to restrict lending. The city's interbank overnight lending rate was between 70 and 90 yuan per 1,000 yuan, generally around 80 yuan. Before noon, funds flowed out of the industry, and the overnight lending rate fell to 70 yuan. Cash remained scarce yesterday, and cashier's checks were widely used, with a discount rate higher than 4%. Industry firms limited the maximum withdrawal to 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In order to tighten market credit, the Central Bank restricted cash withdrawals for exchange balances for all firms starting from the 16th to 30%. In special circumstances, approval from the president is required for withdrawals. It is understood that the recent shortage of cash in the market, which has led to the emergence of discount rates, is mainly due to excessively high remittance rates. For example, remittances from Shanghai to Chongqing and Chengdu are 400 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Many merchants are carrying cash to arbitrage remittance rates, resulting in a large outflow of cash.</p>
<h3>Most Brokerage Guarantee Deposits Have Been Paid</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The city's Securities Exchange is scheduled to formally reopen on the 21st. The required guarantee deposits for each broker are 300,000 yuan for stocks and bonds, with 40% to be paid in cash before noon on the 16th. The remaining 60% can be satisfied with listed bonds or state-owned shares before noon on the 19th. Yesterday was the deadline for paying cash deposits. According to Securities Exchange statistics, 199 stock brokers have paid, and 140 bond brokers have paid. Among them, 60 exclusively deal in stocks, one exclusively deals in bonds, and 139 deal in both, totaling 200 firms. A total of 40.68 million yuan in cash has been collected as guarantee deposits.</p>
<h3>Limited Supply and Demand for Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market has recently formed a situation of limited supply and demand. Although manufacturers continue to raise prices due to various environmental factors, it is still difficult to make a profit. Stores, aware that it is difficult to replenish stock after selling, that the quality of goods is gradually deteriorating, and that there are many shortages, mostly adopt a cautious attitude of preferring inaction to action. On the demand side, the customer base has narrowed due to the current situation. In this street, sales prices are high due to high prices of goods, and the weather has not yet warmed up, so spring sales have not yet started, resulting in very few retail and wholesale transactions in recent days. Therefore, the standard market prices have not fluctuated significantly.</p>
<h3>Silk Sales Are Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market continued to rise. The gold price outside the circle rose sharply, and credit within the industry went from loose to flooded, with market sentiment initially rising and then stabilizing.

However, because the opening price was already high, the rise stalled. Near noon, the yarn and cloth markets outside the circle were doing better, but credit tightened slightly, and the appetite seemed slightly weaker. The next-day settlement was done at 485,000 yuan. In the afternoon, credit tightened, and overnight interest rates rose to 90 or 100 yuan. Retail investors sold off, and prices fell. Tianqiao was quoted at 460,000 to 470,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the crepe market was suspended immediately after the opening, and the upward trend was sharp and encouraging. Off-exchange trading continued to rise. Huaqiang quilt covers opened at 300,000 yuan, and exchange trading was immediately suspended. Off-exchange prices rose to 310,000 yuan. Meiya initially traded at 305,000 yuan, then also rose by 10,000 yuan. After the increase, the market rose slightly. By noon, credit had tightened slightly, buying interest had weakened, and quotations had also stabilized.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Rises Sharply</p>
<p>The tung oil trend, which had just stabilized, saw the rise rekindle like dying embers yesterday morning. The market rose all the way up, and quotations were more firm than before. Market sentiment was bullish, and speculation was rampant, causing the market to soar. Trading activity throughout the day was also quite active.</p>
<p>National Bank Suddenly Stops</p>
<p>The US Aid Association and the Central Bank's entrusted China Textile to dump yarn on the market to suppress prices has been going on for quite some time. Yesterday, this work suddenly stopped, and the Central Bank refused to disclose the reason. The news caused yarn prices to skyrocket. It is not known whether sales will continue today, China Textile and the Central Bank could not be reached for comment.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Soar</h3>

<p>The cotton cloth market rose uniformly under the influence of the black market and off-exchange prices. Market sentiment was generally invigorated, and stores were eager to replenish their stock. Customers also showed interest, and buying interest suddenly became strong. All cloths advanced to new highs, resulting in a rise of about 20%. Leading fine cloth was quoted at 14,000 yuan off-exchange, up 2,000 yuan.

<h3>Extraneous Goods Soar, Rice Prices Skyrocket, North Market White Rice Exceeds 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Rice market surges, due to the soaring black market gold price, extraneous goods are all rising in unison, people's hearts are shaken, so they also follow the surge. The rising momentum in the North City Market is even more intense than in the South City Market. In the North City Market, white rice initially opened above 10,000 yuan, once reaching 10,500 yuan. Later, because the gold price dropped, people's hearts also calmed down. Moreover, the price increase in the South City Market was less, so the market gradually softened at the close. White rice ultimately closed at 10,000 yuan, thin rice also reached 10,000 yuan, early rice 9,700 yuan, each soaring by 1,700 to 1,800 yuan, white yuan 10,200 yuan.

The central market paid even more. Retail investors and local dealers scrambled to buy. Soybean oil once exceeded the 50,000 yuan mark, reaching 51,000 yuan.
