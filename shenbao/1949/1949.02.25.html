<p>〔中央社廣州廿四日電〕廿三日行政院會議通過之「財政金融改革案」全文如下：</p>
<p>（甲）關於財政者：（一）切實估計本年內軍事上必需之一切費用及物資，以便通盤核計，作切實可靠之籌劃，預為準備，並特別注意左列各項：一·薪餉數額以銀元為標準計算之；二·副秣費數額以銀元為標進計算之；三·軍糧所需米麵數量，四·軍服所需花紗布數量，五·兵工燃料，電信工程等所需外國器材及外匯數額。（二）從速確定本年度施政方針，編訂預算，使一切政治設施有所依據，一切經費開支有所範圍。（三）改訂財政收支系統，中央現所保留之田賦三成，自卅八年糧食年度起歸還地方，原屬中央之土菸·土酒稅，特種營業稅，劃歸地方，並在不妨碳中央稅原則之下，放寬地方征課稅捐之限制，使多數省市縣財政能自給自足，不再仰賴國庫之補助。（四）隨賦征借糧食施行多年，民負已重，應自卅八年糧食年度起停止（按糧食年度係自十月一日起至次年九月卅日止），其已借應還之本息展緩兩年償付。（五）海關進口稅仿照從前海關金單位制，以關元計算繳納，每關元一元等於美金四角，人民得以黃金·白銀·外國幣劵或外匯移轉證向中央銀行換購關元，專充繳納關稅之用，不在市面流通。（六）貨物稅中棉紗，火柴，水泥，捲烟，食糖等集中生產，就廠征稅者照規定我率征收實物，其不便征收實物者，照規定稅率，以實物計數，並依繳稅日當地同等貨品之躉售價格折算金圓繳納。（七）鹽稅之征收，得昭前條貨物稅之規定辦理，必要時政府得辦理一部份官收官運，以維持產銷之均衡。（八）直接稅中之營利事業所得稅，儘量採取同業分攤包繳辦法，就各地各業營業情况估定稅額，責成各同業公會限期催收繳納，以資簡捷。</p>
<p>（乙）關於金融幣制者：（一）黃金，白銀准許人民買賣，中央銀行為平準市價亦得為金。銀之買賣。（二）銀元准許流通買賣，政府籌購白銀敲鑄銀元。（三）外國幣券仍禁止流通，中央銀行收兌外幣應參照黃金市價及外匯移轉證價格計算。（四）黃金·白銀·銀元及外國幣券，除中央銀行外，非經財政部特許不得運送或携帶出國，其旅客携帶金飾總量不超過二市兩銀飾不超過二十市兩，外國幣劵總値不超過美金五百元者不在此限。（五）黃金·白銀·銀元及外國幣劵之運入國境者，除中央銀行外，黃金·白銀應征進口稅，其總率另定之，至旅客携帶金飾總量不超過二市兩，銀飾不超過二十市兩，外國幣券總値不超過美金五百元者免予征稅。</p>
<h3 id="c2">出口外匯及僑匯　全部換取圍移證 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（丙）關於進出口貿易者：（一）凡出口貨品所得之外匯及華僑匯入匯款，均應全部交由中央銀行或其指定銀行換取等値之外匯移轉證，以備自行或轉讓與他人向國外輸入貨品或抵付經核准之非進口外匯需要。（二）中央銀行應維持外匯移轉證之合理市價，以鼓勉出口及僑匯。（三）烟草，石油及石油產品之輸入，仍維持限額分配辦法，糧食，棉花，肥料之輸入，由政府另行規定辦法辦理，其他准許進口之貨品，商人於取得外匯移轉證後，在規定期限內，均得報運進口，至禁止進口及暫停進口貨品之品類，由政府隨時規定公佈。（四）凡由國外以自備外匯輸入貨品屬於前條規定准許進口之品類，得逕向海關報運進口，其屬於限額分配及政府統籌辦理者，須先報經輸出入管理機關之核准。</p>
<h3 id="c3">行使銀元非施行新幣制　金圓券結束發行　向美貨借白銀已有相當成就 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>徐堪答記者問</p>
<p>〔本報廣州廿四日電〕徐堪部長今在記者招待會中答覆記者詢問如下：（一）政府如能保有長江以南地區完整，則每年關稅收入尙可獲美金三千萬元，出口所値亦可有美金兩億元以上，此可對財政支持發生最大力量。（二）徵收貨稅以實物計算，對金圓劵行使並無影響，所收實物仍將全部用於調節市塲。（三）行使銀元並非施行新幣制，而為除行使舊有銀元外，幷以同等重量成色大量造新銀元，以穩定金劵信用。（四）徐氏證實向美貸白銀消息，幷謂已有相當成就。（五）黃金白銀銀元與金圓券無固定比率，由市塲自行訂定，中央銀行不擬掛牌。（六）新方案實施後，金圓券卽結束發行。（七）金融管制機構將於最近撤銷。（八）政府將舉辦黃金外幣存款。（九）地方稅收將另訂收支系統法以杜流弊。（十）公敎待遇決設法恢復戰前待遇。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕「最近有關靑島秩序混亂及恐慌之消息，悉屬無稽」。此為此間方於前晚自青返滬之經合分署糧食組長韓脫之談話。韓氏留青一週，深覺靑島環境安謐而優美，渠特携渠之新婚妻，同赴該地補行一週之密月旅行。據稱：靑島現有充份之糧食，棉花及煤斤，足以維持相當時期之消耗，預計煤斤可維持至四月中旬，棉花可再供一月之需，單以經合分署之麵粉而言，足够維持全市計口配糧（每口廿斤）以迄於六月。渠又證實青島市龔學遂仍在職，渠且曾與龔共餐。惟現以中央已發表秦德純氏兼長靑市，故龔氏可能於近期離靑。又，政府軍刻仍有五萬人左右留駐靑島，該批人馬，紀律頗為嚴明，給養亦佳，有自動武器等精良配備，似足以抗禦外來强力之攻擊。靑地一般觀感，認為共軍在若干時期內，對靑島不致採取行動，而駐靑之美海軍，刻亦無撤退之跡象。韓氏復否認經合分署之麵粉曾由登陸艇運離靑島，惟國際難民組織確曾將屬於該組織之麵粉數百袋，於撤退難民時同時運走。</p>

<h3 id="c18">精誠團結　共撑危局 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>立法院第一屆第三會期到了，秘書處即通吿分散在全國各地的立法委員，自二月二十一日起開始報到；並由京滬滬杭兩路局添掛專用臥車，以便利京杭兩地立委赴京報到。在和戰未定局勢日趨嚴重的今日，立法院自有早日復會的必要；尤其當前的國是與金融經濟等項重要問題，更有待於立法院的復會解決。</p>
<p>惟在立法院第二次會議休會之際，因爲軍事形勢的突變，徐蚌戰事南移至江邊之後，幾將威脅京滬的安全，在京立委爲了民意機關不能在砲火之下從容開會，乃紛紛離京他適，近的分散到滬·杭·漢·湘，遠的則走合灣·福州·廣州·桂林·昆明·重慶。此際立法院欲於短期內在京復會，在事實上似不無困難。留穗的立委乃有聯名致電童冠賢院長，對於該院在京復會表示異議之舉。他們同時推派代表鄒志奮·陳紫楓·潘朝英等來滬，對於立院復會地點問題，正與滬上立委交換意見。可知立法院能否於月内在京復會，恐怕還是問題。</p>
<p>我們對於道個問題的看法，非常簡單。第一，立法委員應該發揮精誠團結的精神。第二，立法院應該趕快做到合法的開會。對於當前的和平問題，改革財政經濟，以及刷新政治等等，不能不拿出切實有效的辦法行政院假使有辦法，又不能不經立法院的通過。故院的復會，不僅是全國人民的殷切期望，而且也是立法委員的職責所在。站在人民的立塲，對於立院復會的地點問題，不論在京復會也好，或在穗復會也好，均可置之不論，但最要緊的，乃在從速復會，而復會却不能閙雙包案的笑話！</p>
<p>和平是全國人民所一致渴盼的，而且也是政府與中共所同時高唱的，但此兩月以來，客觀的事實證明，和平道路依然唱崎不平。政府當局雖已充分表現出「盡其在我」的忍讓精神，但在中共方面，似仍　著「革命到底」的口號，軍事行動仍在繼續進行中，並未表示願即派定代表，亦不肯就地停戰媾和。在這種情况之下，政府當局究將如何「獲致和平」？這個有關國家民族生死存亡的問題，自要全體立法委員以人民代表的立塲，爲周詳的考慮。</p>
<p>其次是金融經濟問題，自去年八月間改革幣制以來，一則因戰亂未定，財政支出浩繁，國家預算無法平衡，再則因金圓劵的膨脹未已，僅僅六七個月的時候，而　　　　手快　變成了老法幣，使金融經濟的危機，日益　　，長此下去，不僅使老百姓活不下去，軍公敎人員鄒不能安於廝守，而且也要使國家的基礎發生動搖。財經措施的再改革，也就刻不容緩。然而改革亦談何容易？老百姓經金圓券創制時的一番剝削，已經創鉅痛深聽見改革，不免談虎色變。據報賊稱，政府當局早已制定了一個財政經濟改革方案，只待李代總統簽字，就可以公佈實施。但這有關國計民生的大事，在實行之前，最好先送經文法院的討論和同意。否則再來一次憲法上「緊急條款」的引用，像前任王雲五財長的糊搞，毛手毛脚的幹，幹出了大毛病，加重老百姓的痛苦，實在吃不消了。立法院袞袞諸公，旣素以人民代表自任，在此緊急時期，豈可因復會地點問題再閙意見，聽人民生活於水深火熱之中，而一任行政官吏的搬弄政策作試騐？</p>
<p>要之，和平不成功，人民將活不下去；物價的漲風不停止，人民也不能生活，共他的一切，更談不到。所以今日實爲國家最嚴重的時候，全國上下若能一本「風雨同舟」的精神，共撑目前的危局，或許還有「化險爲夷」的一綫希望。反之，假使内部仍不能團結致，仍要互鬧意見，讓政客們上了間諜的當，極盡共分崩離析的拆台能事，則國家還有什麽光明，人民還有什麽指望？人民代表諸公！千萬不要忘了諸公背後的人民啊！</p>

<p>〔本報厦門廿日航訊〕厦前市長陳榮芳任內批准發還漢奸黃世金產業，計樓屋百餘座，得賄款計美鈔十二萬，造成厦市空前集團大舞弊案。緣漢奸黃世金，台灣籍，抗戰前充敵特務工作，利用職權，在厦搶奪業產甚多，就房屋一項，據統計卽達一百廿四座，旋一五七師黃濤部駐廈，黃世金卽經人檢舉受捕，解省槍決，全部業產標封。厦市光復後，該部財產由政府撥充市庫，唯黃之弟黃世銘，不服政府此種處理，托人向前市長黃天爵說項，爲時三年，仍未見效。近省府改組，李良榮接長閩政後，黃又向省活動，一月前，省常局卽訓令厦市稱：「黃世金公產，准予會同地籍整理處檢據發還。」市長陳榮芳接到此項訓令後，卽派員向黃世銘接洽，結果黃世銘答應願將坐在普佑街四十四號價値十二萬美元之樓屋奉贈。詎料該事正在進行中，省府主席朱紹良發表更動厦市長消息，舊市長爲達到目的計，卽加緊進行，令黃世銘卽交美鈔十二萬元，在渠任内允將全部業產發還。至太月十六日新舊市長移接之際，市府發還之全部指令，計九十九張，由陳榮芳交收發室發出，爲新市長李怡星獲悉，將全部發還書扣留，惟前數日經發出者十餘張無法收回，（内係批准發還樓屋十座），致此賄放逆產鉅案，轟動厦市。近據新市長表示：渠對此案決澈查到底，聞內部牽涉陳市長任內人員頗多，決報省府解決。此鉅大舞弊案，牽涉約有前市府收發郭國楨，主任秘書黃榮民，及秘書科長數人。</p>

<p>〔中央社廣州廿四日電〕財政部長徐堪，爲行政院廿三日通過財政金融改革方案，特於甘四日下午四時，在中央銀行舉行記者招待會，就財政金融改革案加以說明如下：「數月以來，政府倡導和平，期以政治方法，解決國內糾紛，同時積極籌謀軍事，政治，經濟上之改革，以期休養生息，從事和平建設。現在政府南遷，部署粗定，關於軍事，政治方面之改革，正在各主管機關研究擬議中。經濟問題，自以財政爲樞紐，本人忝長財政，硏究改進，責無旁貸，因與有關方面多方會商，詳加硏討，以爲當前財政上最電之病態，爲國庫支出龐大，收入短少，而通貨繼續膨脹。經濟上最大之危機爲生產萎縮，物資缺乏。補救之道，首在確定開源節流之方針，並運用其他資源，以抑止通貨之膨脹。次爲運用金融力量，貿易政策，以促進生產，爭取物資，調節市塲，安定生活。經本上述意旨，擬具財政經濟改革方案，於昨日提經國民黨中央政治會議及行政院務會議修正通過。原案計分財政·金融幣制·進出口貿易，物資調節，及增加生產等五章。其中物資調節及增加生產兩章，均爲各主管機關應行辦理之事，且無變更現行法之處，經決議由行政院分令各主管機關，切實籌劃辦理。其餘財政·金融幣制及進出口貿易三章，改稱財政金融改革案，由院呈請總統命令公佈實施，並授權行政院修訂有關法令，補充立法程序。茲就該案内重要各點，說明於次：</p>
<p>第一章　關於財政者，計分八項。其中第一，二兩項，意在確定軍政各費之支出限度，一方面配合軍事政洽之改革，使支出能有所縮减，一方面使軍警公敎人員待遇有所改善，以安定其生活，提高其工作效率。至關於文職人員改善得遇，已另案解決，故在本案內未列專條。第二·三兩項意在充將地方財政，减輕人民負担，其中關於田賦之歸還地方，徵借糧食之停止，政府早有此意，祗以軍糧需量頗大，一時難籌抵補，故尙未實行，此次決心予以貫澈。第四至第八各項，意在使國稅收入確實可靠，并杜遲延取巧之弊。其中關稅征收關元，係恢復從前海關金單位舊制，惟以關金劵曾一度作爲貨幣流通，現經廢止，爲免誤會起見，故稱爲關元。貨物稅中如棉紗。火柴·水泥等集中生產者，改征實物，祗須以實物計數，於移成若干數量後提取應用，或在市塲出售，手續上極爲便利，幷不如征糧之零星瑣碎，與輾轉收運之糜費困難，而政府得藉此掌握一部份物資，以供軍公之用。至於食鹽辦理一部份官收官運，以比來市塲利率過高，鹽商資金缺乏，生產運銷均受打擊，若干地區已有停產斷運之現象，亟須政府協力以資補救故也。</p>
<p>第二章　關於金融幣制者，計分五項。其主要意旨在開放黃金白銀自由買賣，銀元自由流通，政府籌劃大量鼓鑄銀元，增加其流通數量，隨時以金銀平凖市價，以穩定金圓券之價値。一方面，對於外國幣券，爲維持國家體制，仍禁止流通，而由中央銀行以合理價格收換。同時放寬黃金白銀銀元及外國幣劵輸入之限制，以增加金銀等之儲藏量，逐漸鞏固幣制之基礎。</p>
<p>第三章　關於進出口貿易者，計分四項。其主要改進爲放寬輸入之限制，除烟草，石袖等消費品，基於經濟上之觀點，不能不維持限額分配制度外，其餘准許進口之貨品，均可搬運進口，不須請領輸入許可證。而出口商辦理進口，亦可不受限制，出口所得外匯，及華僑匯款之外匯移轉證價格，使其與外匯市價不生差別，以鼓勵出口及僑匯。同時幷開放自備外匯輸入貨品，以增加進口物資之來源。上述各節，爲此次財政金融方面改革之要點，及其主要意義之所在，其各項實施辦法，及應行修訂之法令，正在分別草擬中。經濟問題極端複雜，本人才力有限，所見容有未了，而政令之推行，尤賴輿論界與社會人士之贊助，深望諸位先生不吝指敎，幷予協助推行，以宏實效，實所感幸。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿四日電〕南斯拉夫外次貝勃勒今日向四外長代表會議要求將斯拉夫人居多數之奧國加林西亞省，在奧國範圍內成爲一自治省。貝勃勒稱：自洽省應有其獨立之行政，包括擁有保安隊在內，並有單獨之省政府議會及司法權。貝勃勒又提出四點妥協辦法，（一）修改有利於南國之現有邊界。（二）斯拉夫人之加林西亞省在奧國之下，有政治經濟及文化自主權。（三）奧對南作充分之賠償。（四）在上述自治區外居住於奧國之斯拉夫人，應予以少數民族權利之保障</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿三日電〕據悉：南斯拉夫廿三日已決定放棄割讓七二八方哩奧領土之要求，此乃對奧和約中最主要隙礙之一。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨有一七十二高齡之美籍牧師勃朋，自徐州抵滬。勃朗牧師在徐州佈道已三十七年，並設有醫院一所，此次乃爲藥品缺乏而來滬設法。渠自徐州乘卡車至運河區，然後坐民船沿運河南下，全程僅費時三日。據談自共軍進佔徐州後，敎會工作並未受到阻礙，醫院照常開設，學校適在寒假期間，一部份敎師則須受訓。共軍有若干部隊駐紮於小學校內，亦有進入天主敎堂者，惟並未强佔有人居住之民房。宗敎目由顯然未受侵犯，勃朗之敎堂內仍有中國人來做禮拜，其他敎堂雖有共軍駐紮，亦仍可公然申述信仰。惟渠曾聽聞在鐵路綫以外之兩荒僻小城內，宗敎活動確被禁止。</p>
<p>共軍對於渠之行動並無限制，渠離徐時曾擬取「派司」，但共軍謂「日本人要派司，國民黨亦要派司，我人則不需此種麻煩」。</p>
<p>關於徐州現狀，渠稱大部份商店尙未開門，惟街頭小販活躍。銀元每元合北海銀行鈔二萬四千元，價甚穩定，金圓券尙可流通一兩月，價則波動甚劇。城內電力供應較國軍守駐時期爲佳。土地重分配，迄今並未實行，共軍曾吿渠稱，關於土地改革母須强迫實行。火車亦已恢復，西至鄭州二五〇哩，南至宿縣七十哩，北至濟南一二〇哩，東向海州七十五哩，均可通車，惟均於夜間行駛。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Announcement of Financial and Monetary Reform Plan: Customs Import Duties Calculated in Customs Gold Units; People Allowed to Buy and Sell Gold and Silver <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] The full text of the "Financial and Monetary Reform Plan" passed by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Finance: (1) Accurately estimate all necessary military expenses and materials for this year to comprehensively calculate and make realistic and reliable plans for preparation, and pay special attention to the following items: 1. Salary amounts calculated in silver dollars; 2. Allowance amounts calculated in silver dollars; 3. The quantity of rice and flour needed for military provisions; 4. The quantity of cotton cloth needed for military uniforms; 5. The amount of foreign equipment and foreign exchange needed for ordnance fuel, telecommunications engineering, etc. (2) Promptly determine the policy direction for this year, compile a budget, so that all political facilities have a basis, and all financial expenditures have a scope. (3) Revise the financial revenue and expenditure system. The 30% of land tax currently retained by the central government will be returned to local governments starting from the 38th grain year. The local tobacco and alcohol taxes, and special business taxes originally belonging to the central government will be assigned to local governments. While not hindering the principle of central taxation, restrictions on local tax levies will be relaxed, so that the finances of most provinces, cities, and counties can be self-sufficient and no longer rely on subsidies from the national treasury. (4) The collection of food grains through forced levies has been implemented for many years, and the people's burden has become heavy. It should be stopped starting from the 38th grain year (the grain year is from October 1st to September 30th of the following year), and the principal and interest of borrowed items that should be returned will be extended for two years. (5) Customs import duties will be calculated and paid in Customs Gold Units, following the former Customs Gold Unit system, with each Customs Gold Unit equal to 40 US cents. People can purchase Customs Gold Units from the Central Bank with gold, silver, foreign currency, or foreign exchange transfer certificates solely for the purpose of paying customs duties and will not be circulated in the market. (6) For goods subject to commodity tax, such as cotton yarn, matches, cement, cigarettes, and sugar, which are produced centrally and taxed at the factory, physical goods will be collected according to the prescribed rates. For those that are inconvenient to collect in physical goods, the amount will be calculated based on the prescribed tax rates and converted into gold yuan based on the wholesale price of the same goods in the local area on the day of tax payment. (7) The collection of salt tax shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article on commodity tax. When necessary, the government may operate a portion of official collection and transportation to maintain a balance between production and sales. (8) In the direct tax of business income tax, as far as possible, adopt the method of sharing and contracting payments by the same industry, estimate the tax amount based on the business conditions of each industry in various regions, and entrust the respective trade associations to urge and collect the payments within a time limit to simplify the process.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Finance and Currency System: (1) People are allowed to buy and sell gold and silver, and the Central Bank may also buy and sell gold and silver to stabilize market prices. (2) Silver dollars are allowed to circulate and be traded. The government plans to purchase silver and mint silver dollars. (3) Foreign currency is still prohibited from circulation. The Central Bank's exchange of foreign currency should be calculated with reference to the market price of gold and the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. (4) Gold, silver, silver dollars, and foreign currency may not be transported or carried out of the country without special permission from the Ministry of Finance, except for the Central Bank. This restriction does not apply to travelers carrying gold jewelry totaling no more than two market ounces, silver jewelry totaling no more than twenty market ounces, or foreign currency totaling no more than US$500. (5) Those transporting gold, silver, silver dollars, and foreign currency into the country, except for the Central Bank, gold and silver should be subject to import duties, and the overall rate will be determined separately. Travelers carrying gold jewelry totaling no more than two market ounces, silver jewelry totaling no more than twenty market ounces, or foreign currency totaling no more than US$500 are exempt from taxation.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Export Foreign Exchange and Overseas Remittances: All to be Exchanged for Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(C) Regarding Import and Export Trade: (1) All foreign exchange earned from exporting goods and remittances from overseas Chinese should be handed over to the Central Bank or its designated bank in exchange for foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value, to be used by oneself or transferred to others for importing goods from abroad or paying for approved non-import foreign exchange needs. (2) The Central Bank should maintain a reasonable market price for foreign exchange transfer certificates to encourage exports and overseas remittances. (3) The import of tobacco, petroleum, and petroleum products will continue to maintain the quota allocation method. The import of food, cotton, and fertilizers will be handled according to the government's separate regulations. For other goods allowed to be imported, merchants can report for import within the prescribed time limit after obtaining foreign exchange transfer certificates. The types of goods prohibited from import and temporarily suspended from import will be determined and announced by the government at any time. (4) For goods imported from abroad with self-provided foreign exchange that fall into the categories allowed to be imported under the preceding article, they can be directly reported to the customs for import. Those belonging to quota allocation and government-coordinated handling must first be approved by the import and export management agency.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Exercising Silver Dollars Does Not Mean Implementing a New Monetary System; Gold Yuan Notes Cease Issuance; Borrowing Silver from the United States Has Achieved Considerable Success <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Xu Kan Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] Minister Xu Kan answered reporters' questions at a press conference today as follows: (1) If the government can maintain the integrity of the area south of the Yangtze River, the annual customs revenue can still reach US$30 million, and the value of exports can also exceed US$200 million, which can have the greatest impact on financial support. (2) Collecting commodity taxes in kind will not affect the circulation of gold yuan notes. The collected physical goods will still be used entirely to regulate the market. (3) Exercising silver dollars does not mean implementing a new monetary system, but in addition to exercising existing silver dollars, a large number of new silver dollars of the same weight and fineness will be minted to stabilize the credit of gold yuan notes. (4) Xu confirmed the news of borrowing silver from the United States, saying that considerable success has been achieved. (5) There is no fixed ratio between gold, silver, silver dollars, and gold yuan notes. It is determined by the market itself, and the Central Bank does not intend to list prices. (6) After the implementation of the new plan, the issuance of gold yuan notes will cease immediately. (7) Financial control agencies will be abolished soon. (8) The government will launch gold and foreign currency deposits. (9) A separate law on the revenue and expenditure system for local taxes will be formulated to prevent abuses. (10) Efforts will be made to restore the pre-war treatment of public education and religious personnel.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] The new financial and monetary reform plan was announced by Minister of Finance Xu Kan at a press conference on the second floor of the Central Bank's head office in this city at 4:00 PM on the 24th.

After the reading, Minister Xu stood up and explained the reasons and rationale for the reform plan one by one (the original text is published on page two). According to the Minister of Finance, the weight and fineness of the new silver dollars will be the same as the old silver dollars.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Li Shucheng Reports on Impressions of Visiting Communist Areas <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 24th] Li Shucheng, a respected elder of Hubei Province, reported to people from the Hubei Provincial Peace Promotion Association on the afternoon of the 24th on his impressions of visiting the Communist areas, stating that the prospects for peace are very promising. The Communists have no room for compromise on the issue of war criminals. In view of the heavy sacrifices made by the people in the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, they do have a sincere desire for peace. However, it is feared that it will not be easy to compromise on the reorganization of the army. They are somewhat suspicious of the government's pursuit of peace and the peace movement in Shanghai and Hankou. General observations suggest that the Communist Party's attitude also adopts the principle of "preparing for war while seeking peace." We can only continue to appeal from the people's standpoint to dispel suspicion, communicate emotions, and achieve genuine peace, and must not be biased, increasing unnecessary disputes. Speaking of the situation in the Communist areas, Li said: The Communist Party has three slogans: (1) The chief culprits will not be taught. (2) Those who are coerced will not be investigated. (3) Those who have meritorious service will be rewarded. Currently, all schools and employees of industrial and commercial groups in the Communist areas spend two hours a day studying the eight conditions and the issue of crossing the river. Li also said that the reason why the Communist army is not crossing the river now may be that they need rest and replenishment. It is heard that some of the Communist army are still at home for the New Year.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] The Executive Yuan's appointment of Chen Jitang as the Chief Executive of the Hainan Special Region has attracted widespread attention. Reporters visited Chen on the 24th and inquired about his opinions on governing Hainan. According to him, he had not considered this position beforehand, and the date of taking office has not been decided. However, after taking office, all measures will be based on the instructions of the central government and will go all out. Chen also stated that he had inspected Hainan in 1932 and intended to formulate a plan, namely, to complete the island's ring railway, establish port terminals, build roads, connect the Wuzhi Mountains, and establish an arsenal. If he takes office in the future, he may proceed along these lines.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Vice President of the Executive Yuan Wu Tiecheng arrived in Nanjing by special plane from Guangzhou at 2:20 PM on the 24th. This is the first time that an important leader of the Executive Yuan has returned to Nanjing since the Executive Yuan moved to Guangzhou. Those who came with him included Minister of the Interior Hong Lanyou, Vice Minister of the Interior Zhang Shouxian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao, Legislative Members Chen Bosheng, Jiang Yiping, Zheng Zhenyu, Liu Xiaoyi, and the Chairman of the Guangdong and Hong Kong General Branch of the Kuomintang Li Dachao, and more than ten others. The plane took off from Guangzhou at 10:15 AM and briefly stopped at Nanchang Airport due to the weather in Nanjing. Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, Chen Kewen, Ni Jiongheng, Huang Bodu, and others who had heard the news went to the airport to welcome them. After the special plane landed, Wu first got off the plane and shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers. Then, at the request of the reporters present, he met with reporters from various newspapers in the airport lounge and answered questions. Wu first emphasized that the opinions between Nanjing and Guangzhou were completely consistent. When reporters asked if there was hope for peace, Wu replied in an optimistic tone: Of course there is hope, as long as everyone works hard. When reporters asked what symbols he hoped for, Wu said: Because the people want peace, everyone wants peace, peace will definitely be achieved. When reporters asked if there was any new contact regarding US aid, Wu smiled and said: The 1948 Economic Aid to China Program should expire in March of this year, and the 1949 Foreign Aid Act should begin in July. During the transition period from April to June of this year, we have exchanged opinions with Lai Parke on the economic assistance plan. Lai Parke has now returned to the United States, but as far as I know, there is nothing related to military aid. When reporters asked about the opinions of the legislative members in Guangzhou on the restoration of the Legislative Yuan, Wu replied: The legislative members in Guangzhou do not oppose the restoration of the meeting in Nanjing, nor do they insist on the restoration of the meeting in Guangzhou. However, they feel that in this turbulent autumn of the country, unity should be the priority. Wu also said: The government is determined to reform politics and is determined to start with itself. The practices and styles will be changed. Wu then got into the car and returned to the residence to rest.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] It is learned that President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke is scheduled to come to Nanjing from Guangzhou in three or four days. Important leaders of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan in Guangzhou will also come with him. Vice President of the Executive Yuan Wu Tiecheng declared this definite news to reporters in the airport lounge after arriving in Nanjing from Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 24th. Wu also told reporters in a solemn tone: The rumors that Acting President Li and President Sun have not fully agreed on certain issues are not true. Acting President Li exchanged opinions with President Sun several times during this southern tour, and there was no disagreement. In the future, the Executive Yuan meetings will still be held in Guangzhou. If the minister is not present, the vice minister can represent him. All important political officials will travel back and forth between Nanjing and Guangzhou. There is no contradiction with Acting President Li's idea that the center of affairs is in Guangzhou and the center of politics is in Nanjing. Wu also said that President Sun and other important leaders of the Executive Yuan will travel to and from Nanjing and Guangzhou in the future to assist Acting President Li in presiding over the great plan for peace. President Sun has already reassured Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng, who have submitted their resignations.</p>

<p>Branch Bureaus Set Up in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to a broadcast by the Shaanbei Chinese Communist Radio, the Chinese Communists have established a unified organization for railway transportation in North China, called the "Pingjin Railway Administration," which was established in Beiping on the 22nd. This is a new facility of the Ministry of Transportation after the Chinese Communist "People's Government" of Shijiazhuang moved to Beiping. The Chinese Communists appointed Guo Hongtao as the Director of the Administration, Liu Jianzhang as the First Deputy Director, and Guo Weicheng as the First Deputy Director. The headquarters is located in Beiping, with branch bureaus set up in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang. The bureau manages: (1) the entire PingSui Railway, (2) the section of the BeiNing Road within the customs (including Shanhaiguan), (3) the section of the PingHan Road north of Shijiazhuang (excluding Shijiazhuang), and (4) the section of the Jinpu Road north of Dezhou (including Dezhou).</p>

<p>Flying Round-Trip Twice from Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Taiyuan is in dire need of food. Recently, Yan Xishan came south mainly to discuss sources of food supply and assistance. It is reported that three airline companies, China, Central, and Civil Aviation Corps, have been entrusted by the government to transport food from Shanghai to Taiyuan for airdrop assistance. China and the Civil Aviation Corps have each sent 10 aircraft to participate, and China has more than 10 aircraft. These special grain transport planes take off before dawn every day. Because Shanghai is far away, they can only make two round trips at most each day. On average, each plane can transport more than three tons of grain each day. The three companies' planes can transport more than 100 tons per day in total. The airline companies also transported grain to Taiyuan for assistance once a month ago, using Qingdao as a base. However, it was suspended due to the shortage of gasoline in Qingdao. This time, it takes off from Shanghai, but the distance is longer, and the transportation rate is greatly affected. It is reported that the airline companies are trying to solve the gasoline supply in Qingdao so that Qingdao can still be used as the departure point.</p>
<h3 id="e15">No Signs of Panic in Qingdao; Ample Reserves of Grain, Coal, and Cotton; Head of the Food Group of the Economic Cooperation Administration Talks About His Return to Shanghai from Qingdao <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] "Recent news about the chaos and panic in Qingdao is all baseless." This is what Han Tuo, the head of the food group of the Economic Cooperation Administration, who returned to Shanghai from Qingdao the night before last, said. Han stayed in Qingdao for a week and felt that Qingdao's environment was peaceful and beautiful. He specially took his newlywed wife to the area for a week-long honeymoon trip. According to reports, Qingdao currently has sufficient grain, cotton, and coal to maintain consumption for a considerable period. It is estimated that coal can last until mid-April, and cotton can supply another month's needs. In terms of flour from the Economic Cooperation Administration alone, it is enough to maintain rationed food for the entire city (20 catties per person) until June. He also confirmed that Gong Xuesui is still in office in Qingdao, and he even dined with Gong. However, now that the central government has announced that Qin Dechun will also serve as the mayor of Qingdao, Gong may leave Qingdao in the near future. In addition, there are still about 50,000 government troops stationed in Qingdao. These troops have strict discipline, good supplies, and sophisticated equipment such as automatic weapons, which seems to be enough to resist attacks from external forces. The general feeling in Qingdao is that the Communist army will not take action against Qingdao within a certain period. There are also no signs that the US Navy stationed in Qingdao is withdrawing. Han also denied that the flour of the Economic Cooperation Administration had been transported away from Qingdao by landing craft. However, the International Refugee Organization did transport several hundred bags of flour belonging to the organization at the same time when evacuating refugees.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony on the morning of the 28th. Formal deliberations will be postponed to early March to allow legislators from distant locations to arrive and participate, ensuring that most legislators can express their opinions when discussing important issues, thereby achieving the goals of respecting the majority opinion and complete unity. Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian is scheduled to hold a tea party on the 27th to welcome the arriving legislators and exchange views beforehand. All legislators who have arrived in Nanjing and reported are also scheduled to hold a symposium before the meeting, possibly on the afternoon of the 25th if time permits, or otherwise on the afternoon of the 26th.</p>
<p>Liu Jianqun Writes to Tong Guanxian, Expressing His Imminent Departure for Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The dispute over whether the Legislative Yuan should reconvene in Nanjing or Guangzhou is likely to be resolved. Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian received a letter on the 24th from Vice President Liu Jianqun stating that he would be coming to Nanjing soon. His family had just arrived in Guangzhou, and as soon as they were settled, he would depart.</p>
<p>In addition, the Legislative Yuan Secretariat has arranged for a special plane to fly from Nanjing to Hankou on the 24th to pick up over forty legislators in Hankou and bring them to Nanjing on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Legislator registration continued on the 24th. Because a portion of the Shanghai legislators arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 24th, the number of registrations for the day reached twenty-nine, bringing the total to fifteen.</p>
<p>It was learned on the 24th that the legislators in Guangzhou will soon be coming to Nanjing and are awaiting their departure by plane. Furthermore, it is expected that the forty legislators in Guilin will also arrive in Nanjing within two or three days.</p>
<p>Chen Bosheng and Others Return to Nanjing</p>
<p>Report on the Opinions of Legislators in Guangzhou</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian hosted a banquet at his official residence at 7:00 p.m. on the 24th for legislators Chen Bosheng, Jiang Yiping, Zheng Zhenyu, and Liu Xiaoyi, who arrived in Nanjing from Guangzhou that day. Jiang and Zheng were representatives of the Shanghai legislators who went to Guangzhou to exchange views with the legislators there. During the banquet, they reported the opinions of the legislators in Guangzhou to Tong. According to Mr. Zheng Zhenyu, most of the legislators in Guangzhou, with very few exceptions, had no preconceived notions about the location of the reconvening. Based on safety considerations, they advocated reconvening in Guangzhou and believed that many others would support this. However, they were not insistent on reconvening in Guangzhou. They expressed considerable dissatisfaction with the Legislative Yuan's issuance of the notice that registration for the reconvening in Nanjing would begin on the 21st without prior consultation with the legislators in Guangzhou. They felt that President Tong had stated that the location of the reconvening should respect the opinion of the majority, but without a vote, how could it be proven that those advocating reconvening in Nanjing were in the majority? However, after Mr. Zheng and other committee members explained on behalf of President Tong, they were largely understanding and believed that after the Legislative Yuan convened, they would come to Nanjing to participate.</p>
<p>Chen Zifeng and Six Others Host Legislators Remaining in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Legislators Chen Zifeng and six others, who came to Shanghai from Guangzhou to solicit opinions, held a tea party at the New Life Club at 3:00 p.m. on the 24th to welcome legislators remaining in Shanghai and exchange views on the issue of the reconvening location. Chen Zifeng first explained the purpose of the trip and emphasized the importance of unity. Lin Dong then reported, stating that the colleagues remaining in Guangzhou were not insisting that the meeting had to be held in Guangzhou, but that the initial decision to reconvene in Guangzhou was made by the legislators' talk session, and that the opinions of the colleagues should also be respected and a vote taken. Lin also stated that the report that legislators in Guangzhou could receive 300 Hong Kong dollars per month was inaccurate and believed that the person who published the news should be held legally responsible. Subsequently, Wu Yunpeng, Zhang Qianhua, Niu Jianchu, and others spoke, all advocating that the opinion of unity should be valued. Niu also suggested that they could first report to Nanjing, but that the opening time should be considered cautiously. Cheng Cangbi explained that the legislators remaining in Shanghai had met several times and wanted to seek a win-win solution. Their final decision was to first go to Nanjing to reconvene, and then immediately resolve to relocate, which was a legal procedure that the Legislative Yuan had to go through. Duan Jianmin loudly exclaimed, "I will not be someone else's tool." Fang Zhichao advocated first holding the meeting in Nanjing, and then relocating when the military situation in Jiangnan changed. Pan Chaoying said, "If the Executive Yuan says it is relocating its office, it should be approved by the Legislative Yuan. Why did President Tong abruptly move the Legislative Yuan's seal to Guangzhou?" Finally, Zou Zhifen, Chen Zifeng, and others spoke, stating that the legislators remaining in Guangzhou had no preconceived notions and hoped that everyone would unite and consider carefully. Cheng Cangbo then warmly invited six representatives to go to Nanjing on the night train from Shanghai to discuss the matter, because the focus was on Nanjing, not Shanghai. Zou then said that he had sent a telegram to President Tong on the 23rd and would make a decision after receiving a reply. The talk session ended at around 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Over fifty legislators remaining in Shanghai, including Zhang Zhizhi, jointly telegraphed President Tong on the 24th, requesting that the meeting be postponed until a consensus was reached among all parties.</p>
<p>Preparations for Reconvening in Guangzhou; Legislative Yuan Spokesperson Denies</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 24th] The Legislative Yuan's spokesperson told our reporter on the 24th, "Our Guangzhou office has indeed received a telegram from Secretary-General Chen informing us that the third session of the Yuan will be held in Nanjing this month. Before receiving President Tong's telegram, the Guangzhou office could not possibly proceed with 'preparations for reconvening in Guangzhou.' Various reports are absolutely unfounded. As for entertaining legislators coming to Guangzhou, it is a responsibility that should be fulfilled in terms of affairs and cannot be confused with the reconvening issue. Regarding the entertainment method, there are unified regulations for each session, which are planned and handled by the Yuan."</p>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Assembly to Discuss the Legislative Yuan's Reconvening Issue Today</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 24th] The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly will discuss the Legislative Yuan's reconvening issue on the 25th. The Assembly will telegraph Acting President Li, stating that it should reconvene in Nanjing, and also telegraph the legislators in Guangzhou and Taiwan to report quickly.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e18">Sincere Unity, Jointly Supporting the Perilous Situation <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The first session of the third term of the Legislative Yuan has arrived, and the Secretariat has issued a notice to the legislators scattered throughout the country to begin registering from February 21st. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus have added special sleeping cars to facilitate the legislators from Beijing and Hangzhou to travel to Nanjing to register. In today's increasingly serious situation where peace and war have not been decided, the Legislative Yuan has the necessity to reconvene as soon as possible. In particular, current national affairs and important issues such as finance and economy need to be resolved by the reconvening of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>However, at the time of the adjournment of the second session of the Legislative Yuan, due to the sudden change in the military situation, the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign moved south to the banks of the Yangtze River, almost threatening the safety of Nanjing and Shanghai. Legislators in Nanjing, because the representative body should not be able to calmly convene under the gunfire, left Nanjing for other suitable locations. Some dispersed to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hankou, and Hunan, while others went to Taiwan, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Guilin, Kunming, and Chongqing. At this time, it seems to be difficult in fact for the Legislative Yuan to reconvene in Nanjing in the short term. The legislators remaining in Guangzhou jointly telegraphed President Tong Guanxian, expressing their opposition to the Yuan reconvening in Nanjing. At the same time, they sent representatives Zou Zhifen, Chen Zifeng, Pan Chaoying, and others to Shanghai to exchange views with the legislators in Shanghai on the issue of the reconvening location of the Legislative Yuan. It can be seen that whether the Legislative Yuan can reconvene in Nanjing this month is still a problem.</p>
<p>Our view on this issue is very simple. First, the legislators should display a spirit of sincere unity. Second, the Legislative Yuan should quickly achieve legal convening. For the current peace issue, reforming finance and economy, and reforming politics, we must come up with practical and effective measures. If the Executive Yuan has a way, it must be approved by the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the reconvening of the Yuan is not only the earnest expectation of the people of the country, but also the duty of the legislators. Standing on the people's position, for the issue of the reconvening location of the Legislative Yuan, whether it is reconvening in Nanjing or reconvening in Guangzhou, it can be put aside, but the most important thing is to reconvene as soon as possible, and the reconvening cannot make a joke of a double-track case!</p>
<p>Peace is what the people of the country unanimously yearn for, and it is also what the government and the CCP are singing at the same time. However, objective facts in the past two months have proven that the road to peace is still rugged and uneven. Although the government authorities have fully demonstrated the spirit of "doing their best," the CCP seems to be clinging to the slogan of "revolution to the end," and military actions are still continuing, and they have not expressed their willingness to send representatives to negotiate or to cease fire and make peace on the spot. Under this situation, how will the government authorities "achieve peace"? This issue related to the life and death of the nation and the people must be carefully considered by all legislators from the position of representatives of the people.</p>
<p>The second is the financial and economic problem. Since the reform of the currency system in August last year, on the one hand, due to the uncertainty of the war and the huge financial expenditure, the national budget cannot be balanced. On the other hand, due to the continued expansion of the gold yuan, in just six or seven months, the [unable to read] quickly turned into the old legal tender, making the financial and economic crisis increasingly [unable to read]. If this continues, not only will the people not be able to survive, but the military, government, and teachers will not be able to live in peace, and it will also shake the foundation of the country. The reform of financial and economic measures is also imminent. However, how easy is it to talk about reform? The people have already suffered greatly from the exploitation when the gold yuan was created. Hearing about reform, they cannot help but be frightened. According to reports, the government authorities have already formulated a financial and economic reform plan, waiting only for Acting President Li to sign it before it can be announced and implemented. However, it is best to send this major issue related to the national economy and the people's livelihood to the Literary Yuan for discussion and approval before implementation. Otherwise, another application of the "emergency clause" in the Constitution, like the former Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu's muddle-headedness, doing things clumsily, and causing big problems, increasing the suffering of the people, is really unbearable. The legislators of the Legislative Yuan, who have always regarded themselves as representatives of the people, in this emergency period, how can they continue to have opinions on the issue of the reconvening location, listen to the people living in deep water, and allow the administrative officials to manipulate policies as experiments?</p>
<p>In short, if peace is not achieved, the people will not be able to survive; if the price increases do not stop, the people will not be able to live, and everything else is out of the question. Therefore, today is the most serious time for the country. If the whole country can maintain the spirit of "sharing weal and woe" and jointly support the current perilous situation, there may still be a glimmer of hope of "turning danger into safety." On the contrary, if the internal still cannot be united, and still want to make trouble with each other, let the politicians fall into the trap of spies, and do everything they can to split up the country, then what hope does the country have, and what hope do the people have? People's representatives, please don't forget the people behind you!</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Fifty-one Republican congressmen concerned about the China issue will meet with Secretary of State Acheson on the 24th. Previously, the congressmen jointly wrote to President Truman, stating that the CCP's victory would be a failure for the United States and a threat to the security of the United States.

(2) What is the current U.S. policy toward China? (3) Will this policy change, and how will it change? Today's meeting is the result of this letter.

<p>[United Press, Beiping, 24th] CCP soldiers stationed outside foreign consulates occasionally prevent people from entering. Today, several people tried to enter the French consulate but were turned back. However, other visitors were allowed to enter for unknown reasons. Guards stationed outside the U.S. consulate require all people in cars to get out and walk in. Sometimes, those carrying packages out are required to leave the packages behind, but others are allowed to carry packages out without being stopped. It is heard that the Soviet consulate has received instructions from Moscow to cease operations, but Soviet Consul Techevinski has made no statement. Most consular officials and most other foreigners no longer use cars for fear of requisition. The CCP has required all cars in Beiping to obtain new licenses, but has not yet found a way to facilitate foreigners to obtain licenses. The North China People's Government, which has moved here from Shijiazhuang, has no foreign affairs bureau.</p>

The focus of work is to ensure security, so the work related to enriching security teams, rectifying local armed forces, organizing and training the masses, and cultivating civil power must be strengthened.

<h3 id="e33">Former Xiamen Mayor Chen Rongfang's Unprecedented Group Corruption; Received Bribes and Returned Over 100 Buildings of Enemy Property <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Our Xiamen Shipping News, 20th] Former Xiamen Mayor Chen Rongfang approved the return of the property of traitor Huang Shijin during his term, totaling more than 100 buildings, and received bribes totaling 120,000 US dollars, creating an unprecedented group corruption case in Xiamen. The traitor Huang Shijin, a native of Taiwan, was engaged in enemy espionage work before the War of Resistance. He used his power to seize a lot of industrial property in Xiamen. According to statistics, there were as many as 124 houses. Later, Huang Tao's 157th Division was stationed in Xiamen, and Huang Shijin was arrested after being reported and executed by the province, and all of his property was sealed. After the restoration of Xiamen, the property was allocated by the government to the municipal treasury. However, Huang's younger brother, Huang Shiming, did not agree with the government's handling of the matter and asked former Mayor Huang Tianjue to speak on his behalf. After three years, it was still ineffective. Recently, after the reorganization of the provincial government and Li Liangrong took over the Fujian government, Huang turned to the province. A month ago, the Provincial Standing Committee instructed Xiamen that "Huang Shijin's public property shall be returned after checking the evidence together with the Land Registration Office." After Mayor Chen Rongfang received this instruction, he sent personnel to contact Huang Shiming. As a result, Huang Shiming agreed to donate the building at No. 44 Puyou Street, valued at 120,000 US dollars. Unexpectedly, while the matter was in progress, Provincial Government Chairman Zhu Shaoliang announced the news of the change of mayor of Xiamen. In order to achieve his goal, the old mayor accelerated the process, ordering Huang Shiming to hand over 120,000 US dollars, promising to return all of the property during his term. On the 16th of the month, when the old and new mayors transferred, the municipal government issued a total of 99 instructions for return, which were issued by Chen Rongfang to the dispatch and reception room. The new mayor, Li Yixing, learned about it and detained all the return documents. However, more than ten copies (including the approval for the return of ten buildings) that had been issued in the previous few days could not be recovered, causing this huge bribery and release of enemy property case to shock Xiamen. According to the new mayor, he is determined to investigate the case thoroughly. It is heard that many people in Chen's mayoral office are involved, and he has decided to report to the provincial government for resolution. This huge corruption case involves Guo Guozhen, the former municipal government's receiver, Chief Secretary Huang Rongmin, and several section chiefs.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Xu Kan's Explanation of Financial Reform <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] Minister of Finance Xu Kan, in light of the Executive Yuan's passage of the Financial Reform Plan on the 23rd, held a press conference at the Central Bank at 4 p.m. on the 24th to explain the Financial Reform Plan as follows: "For several months, the government has advocated peace, hoping to resolve domestic disputes through political means, while actively preparing for military, political, and economic reforms, in order to recuperate and engage in peaceful reconstruction. Now that the government has moved south and the arrangements are roughly in place, reforms in the military and political areas are being studied and planned by the relevant authorities. Economic problems are centered on finance, and I, as head of finance, have an unshirkable responsibility to study and improve them. Therefore, after consulting extensively with relevant parties and conducting detailed discussions, I believe that the most pressing financial issues are the huge national treasury expenditures, shortfalls in revenue, and continued currency inflation. The biggest economic crises are shrinking production and shortages of materials. The way to remedy this is, first, to determine the principles of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, and to use other resources to curb currency inflation. Second, it is to use financial strength and trade policies to promote production, secure materials, regulate markets, and stabilize livelihoods. Based on the above intentions, a financial and economic reform plan was drafted and passed yesterday by the Kuomintang Central Political Committee and the Executive Yuan's executive meeting after revisions. The original plan was divided into five chapters: Finance, Monetary System, Import and Export Trade, Material Regulation, and Increased Production. Among them, the two chapters on Material Regulation and Increased Production are matters that should be handled by the various competent authorities, and there are no changes to existing laws. It was decided that the Executive Yuan should order the various competent authorities to earnestly plan and implement them. The remaining three chapters, Finance, Monetary System, and Import and Export Trade, were renamed the Financial Reform Plan, and the Executive Yuan requested the President to order their promulgation and implementation, and authorized the Executive Yuan to revise relevant laws and supplement legislative procedures. The important points of the plan are explained below:</p>
<p>Chapter One, Regarding Finance, is divided into eight items. Among them, the first two items are intended to determine the expenditure limits of military and political expenses. On the one hand, it will cooperate with the reform of military affairs and politics to reduce expenditures. On the other hand, it will improve the treatment of military, police, and public education personnel to stabilize their lives and improve their work efficiency. As for the improvement of the treatment of civil servants, it has been resolved in a separate case, so no special article is listed in this case. The second and third items are intended to enrich local finances and reduce the burden on the people. The government has long intended to return the land tax to the local governments and stop the requisition of grain. However, the demand for military grain is quite large, and it is difficult to find a replacement in a short period of time, so it has not been implemented. This time, we are determined to implement it thoroughly. Items four to eight are intended to make national tax revenue reliable and to prevent delays and opportunistic practices. Among them, the customs duty collection is to restore the old system of the previous customs gold unit. However, because customs gold notes were once used as currency in circulation and have now been abolished, they are referred to as customs yuan to avoid misunderstandings. For consumer goods tax such as cotton yarn, matches, and cement, which are produced centrally, we will switch to collecting in kind. We only need to count the goods in kind and extract them for application after a certain quantity is transferred, or sell them on the market. The procedures are extremely convenient, and it is not as piecemeal and trivial as collecting grain, or as wasteful and difficult as transferring and transporting it. The government can use this to control a portion of the materials for military and public use. As for the part of the official collection and transportation of salt, this is because the market interest rate has been too high recently, salt merchants lack funds, and production and sales have been hit hard. Some areas have already experienced production stoppages and transportation disruptions, and the government urgently needs to cooperate to remedy this.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, Regarding the Financial and Monetary System, is divided into five items. The main intention is to open up the free trading of gold and silver, and the free circulation of silver dollars. The government plans to mint a large number of silver dollars and increase their circulation, and use gold and silver to equalize market prices at any time to stabilize the value of gold yuan notes. On the one hand, in order to maintain the national system, foreign currency notes are still prohibited from circulation and are exchanged by the Central Bank at reasonable prices. At the same time, restrictions on the import of gold, silver, silver dollars, and foreign currency notes are relaxed to increase the reserves of gold and silver and gradually consolidate the foundation of the monetary system.</p>
<p>Chapter Three, Regarding Import and Export Trade, is divided into four items. The main improvement is to relax import restrictions. Except for consumer goods such as tobacco and asbestos, which cannot but maintain the quota allocation system from an economic point of view, other goods that are allowed to be imported can be transported and imported without applying for an import permit. Exporters who handle imports are also not restricted. The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates for foreign exchange earned from exports and remittances from overseas Chinese should not differ from the market price of foreign exchange to encourage exports and overseas remittances. At the same time, it also opens up the import of goods with self-provided foreign exchange to increase the source of imported materials. The above points are the main points of this financial reform and its main significance. The implementation methods and the laws to be revised are being drafted separately. Economic problems are extremely complex, and my talents are limited. What I see may not be complete, and the implementation of government orders depends on the support of the press and the public. I sincerely hope that you gentlemen will not hesitate to give your advice and assist in the implementation to achieve practical results. I would be very grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Main Obstacles to the Austrian Peace Treaty Removed; Yugoslavia Abandons Demand for Territorial Cession; Suggests Part of Galicia Province Be Changed to Autonomous; Room for Compromise Remains on Reparations Issue <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] Yugoslavia indicated on the 24th that it was willing to compromise on its territorial and compensation demands to Austria. Thus, two major obstacles to the signing of a peace treaty with Austria have been partially eliminated. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Bebler stated at the meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers that Yugoslavia still wanted reparations and territory, but Bebler did not emphasize the previous specific demands. Bebler had been trying for at least two years to obtain reparations of $150 million and 728 square miles of Austrian territory. Today, he requested the following four items: (1) Modify the Austrian border in favor of Yugoslavia, with the exact demarcation to be determined in the future. (2) Grant political, economic and cultural autonomy to a part of Galicia, but not immediately to Yugoslavia. The residents of that area are mostly Slavic. (3) Huge reparations. (4) Guarantee the rights of the Slavic minority in Austria. This request is much more lenient than before. Yugoslavia had previously insisted that all areas in Austria where the Slavic population was in the majority should be transferred to Yugoslavia. The so-called areas where the Slavic population is in the majority are the 728 square mile area in southern Austria. The United States, Britain, and France had bluntly refused to change Austria's borders or force Austria to pay reparations, but Bebler's proposal has a strong hope of reaching a compromise.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Bebler today asked the meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers to make the Austrian province of Galicia, where Slavs are in the majority, an autonomous province within the scope of Austria. Bebler said: The Self-Governing Province should have its own independent administration, including having a security team, and a separate provincial government, parliament, and judicial power. Bebler also put forward four compromise methods: (1) Modify the existing border in favor of Yugoslavia. (2) The Slavic province of Galicia has political, economic, and cultural autonomy under Austria. (3) Austria shall make full compensation to Yugoslavia. (4) Slavs living in Austria outside the aforementioned autonomous region should be given protection of minority rights.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] It is reported that Yugoslavia has decided on the 23rd to abandon its demand for the cession of 728 square miles of Austrian territory. This is one of the most important gaps in the Austrian peace treaty.</p>

(4) Exchange prisoners of war, starting ten days after the signing of the armistice agreement, and completing no later than twenty-one days after the signing. (5) Demarcate the Ogja on the Palestinian side of the Egyptian border as a demilitarized zone. The Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Committee, headed by UN Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Lee Lai, will work in the city. (6) No military or political advantage should be gained under the armistice. (7) Neither side will resort to force in resolving the Palestinian issue. (8) Both sides will not advance forward from their current occupied positions. (9) Issues concerning non-military demands and rights will be discussed later. (10) The coastal land from the Rafa front line on the border between Egypt and the Holy Land to Gaza, 20 miles within the Holy Land, will be guarded by Egyptian troops. Other troops must withdraw eastward to the areas of Al-Arish and Auja. (11) The Israeli invading troops will withdraw to the positions they occupied before the attack began on October 14 of last year, and the defense forces will continue to be stationed under special agreements. (12) Neither side shall take any warlike or hostile actions against the other side's military or paramilitary forces, or the people under their control. (13) The front line between the two countries should not be destroyed. Aircraft from one side should not cross the airspace of the other side, and ships from one side must not enter areas within three miles of the other side's coast.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] New York, 24th Broadcast: Austin, the chief representative of the United States at the United Nations, said in a speech to a joint meeting of the lower house of the Vermont State Assembly that any attempt to establish a world government at present would inevitably divide the world into the American bloc, the Soviet bloc, and other national blocs that have not joined the above-mentioned blocs. Austin said that the only hope for a world government is to gradually develop work through the existing United Nations mechanism. Austin pointed out that some people who are enthusiastic about supporting world government are sarcastic about the United Nations and belittle efforts to strive for peace. Austin said that those who are currently talking about world government believe that all countries in the world except the Soviet bloc will join. In fact, Sweden, India, Iran, Turkey, and China, which are adjacent to the Soviet Union, are probably unlikely to join.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Washington, 24th Broadcast: President Truman said at a press conference today that the Marshall Plan will continue until Europe can be restored. When reporters cited British Undersecretary of State Mayhew's report to the United Nations Economic and Social Council yesterday, asking for Mr. Du's opinion (Mayhew said at the time that the economic recovery of the United Kingdom was almost complete), Mr. Du said that he was very happy to hear about the improvement in the British economic situation. The Marshall Plan will take four years. If the above news is true, then it may not be necessary to use all of it. However, if the full recovery of the United Kingdom will only be successful after four years, then the Marshall Plan must continue until that time. The President also announced today that he would transfer the current Undersecretary of Aviation, Whitey, to the position of Undersecretary of Commerce to succeed Foster, who had been transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration last spring.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] When the House Foreign Affairs Committee discussed extending the Marshall Plan for another year today, Wallace attended and made a statement, predicting that if the United States and the Soviet Union could not resolve their disputes, it would cause another "Thirty Years' War," and advocating that Truman and Stalin immediately hold a meeting to discuss the problems between the two countries for a permanent solution. Wallace believes that the Marshall Plan has gone bankrupt, and he vehemently criticized the Atlantic Treaty. He suggested that the United States should abandon the "Cold War" policy.</p>

<p>[United Press, Prague, 23rd] Reliable sources said that about 150 foreign officials have been fired in order to make the foreign ministry closely cooperate with the Soviet Union's activities system.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] Well-informed sources reported that the Soviet plan to send thousands of German workers to Czechoslovakia caused a political crisis in Prague. It is reported that Czech President Gottwald rejected the plan, while Prime Minister Zapotocky was prepared to accept it.

<p>The Czech Communists are patrolling the streets of Prague, and identity cards are often checked. This measure can be considered as the anniversary of the Czech Communist coup.

People with access to information said that Moscow wants to have 200,000 to 400,000 Germans live in the Sudetenland, and that when the German army attacked the Czech Republic, it used the excuse of mistreating the German minority. After the war, the Czech Republic expelled the Germans from the Sudetenland, and since then, there has been a lack of technical workers. The Sudetenland has coal mines, chemical factories, and glass factories, etc.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The issue of postal communication between the Nationalists and Communists has been promoted by the postal authorities and all sectors, and it has now achieved good results. The local post office has decided to fully restore the acceptance and delivery of ordinary mail to various parts of the Communist area starting today. Registered mail, express mail, and small parcels of clothing for private use in Tianjin will also be restored at the same time. When the local peace delegation and shipping industry representatives went to Tianjin, the postal authorities entrusted them to consult the Communist side on postal matters. According to a telegram from Peiping the night before, the negotiations on north-south navigation have entered a decisive stage, and the postal issue has also been resolved. It is also heard that the Communist side has appointed Director Feng of the Tianjin Post Office to contact the shipping industry representatives on postal matters. In the future, the ten ships under the jurisdiction of the Shipping Association will regularly travel north and south, and the mail can be entrusted for transportation according to the schedule. The delivery of letters should be completely normalized. The post office is currently planning to transfer mail to the Communist area in North China and other places, except for mail to northern Jiangsu and Anhui, which will be transferred separately. At present, the local post office has three thousand bags of mail accumulated in the Communist area, of which 1,500 bags of pure letters will be transported to Qinhuangdao by the "Nanqiang" ship, which will sail north on the 28th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e51">The First American Ship to Enter the Communist Area, the Fillmore, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; It Is Reported That the City of Tianjin Is as Quiet as Usual <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Following the return of the "Greater Shanghai" ship to Shanghai, the American President Lines' "Fillmore" ship returned to port from Tianjin at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. This is the first foreign ship to sail from the Communist area to Shanghai after the opening of national ships to North China. The ship previously sailed from San Francisco, carrying 1,400 tons of orders before the evacuation of Tianjin, including steel plates, western wax, pigments, etc. It arrived in Tianjin on the 19th of this month. It stayed in Tianjin for three days. Except for unloading the goods, all ship personnel were refused to land. According to Captain Pike of the ship: After the ship docked, representatives of the Tianjin People's Production Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, together with customs officials from Tianjin, boarded the ship for inspection. He tried to persuade them with coffee and cigarettes, but they refused. The inspectors were serious, but quite polite. According to his own eyes: the customs officials still wear the same uniforms as here, and the clothing of the Chinese Communist soldiers on the dock is similar to that of the national army. Even the barges used for unloading the goods are owned by the China Merchants Bureau. The manager of the Tianjin branch of the American President Company was specially permitted to board the ship when the ship arrived. According to him: The city of Tianjin is as quiet as usual, and all the personnel of the American consulate are still safe. On the ship, Chinese Communist Party personnel told him: If he is willing to go south with the ship, he can, but he will not be allowed to come to Tianjin again in the future. When the ship was about to leave, it was originally planned to load a batch of specialties from North China for export. This move had been approved by the Chinese Communist Party, but it failed due to unresolved issues such as exchange settlement. When the ship was about to leave, the Chinese Communist Party personnel told the crew: "If you come again next time, you may be able to go ashore and visit."</p>
<p>Also, according to a United Press dispatch from this city: Chinese Communist Party personnel who boarded the Fillmore avoided discussing politics, but one of them solemnly denied that the Chinese Communist Party "has any connection with Moscow." The Chinese Communist Party representative, Cao Yuanquan, spoke fluent American English and said: "Yes, we are communists, but we are not Soviet communists."</p>

<h3 id="e52">Presidents of National Universities to Petition in Beijing Tomorrow Night, Requesting Rational Adjustment of Regular Expenses Based on Index-Linked Salaries <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, presidents of major national universities in the city gathered at Shanghai Medical College to discuss issues such as improving the salaries of faculty and staff and funding. As a result of the discussions, it was decided that all the presidents would travel to Beijing on the evening of the 27th to petition the central government in person, presenting their difficulties and requesting three points: (1) The adjustment of faculty and staff salaries by 75 times is still far from the original request and makes it impossible to live. It is requested that it be calculated by multiplying the current base salary by the Shanghai cost of living index. (2) The Ministry of Education telegraphed that the regular expenses for each school for February would be issued at ten times the standard for January. Taking Jiaotong University as an example, for a large school with thousands of people, the regular expenses for January were only over ten thousand yuan, which was not enough to cover even the odd expenses such as water and electricity. Therefore, it is requested that future regular expenses be adjusted in line with the current price level. (3) Regarding the issuance of contingency funds, it is requested that each school be given the same treatment as Central University's 1,000 dan of rice and 40 million yuan.</p>
<p>The presidents who will travel to Beijing on the evening of the 27th include Wang Zhizhuo of Jiaotong University, Zhang Yi of Fudan University, Xia Jianbai of Tongji University, Li Yong of Jinan University, Zhu Hengbi of Shanghai Medical College, Zhu Guozhang of Shanghai Business College, Zhou Junshi of Wusong Merchant Marine Vocational School, Dai Cuilun of Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Zhu Kezhen of Zhejiang University, Xia Shuyu of Senior Mechanical Vocational School, Chen Heqin of Kindergarten Normal School, and Qing Zhenxu, acting president of Tangshan Institute of Technology, a total of twelve people.</p>

At the same time, the port headquarters will definitely be deeply moved by the emotions of the seven hundred teachers and students of the college who are looking forward to the start of classes.</p>

<p>Investigation Steps Determined</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Met Yesterday to Discuss</p>
<p>Investigation to Begin on the 26th</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The committee organized by Supervisor Liu Zhe and others to investigate the handling of Northeast materials held a group meeting on the morning of the 24th to discuss the steps of the investigation. It was also decided at the meeting to first invite relevant people such as Wu Guozhen, Wu Huanzhang, and Yang Chuo'an on the 26th to begin a preliminary investigation. According to the news that the meeting was held on the morning of the 24th, about one hundred Northeast compatriots in Shanghai knew about it in advance and gathered at the Supervision Committee's Jiangsu and Zhejiang District Office on Bixun Road, intending to make some requests. After obtaining the consent of Liu Zhe and others, they sent five representatives to attend the meeting to report on the distribution of Northeast materials and the situation of corruption, such as the fact that genuine Northeast people had not received relief and Feng Yun's receipt of funds. The supervisors comforted them and asked them to leave their contact addresses. Because they were busy registering and mistakenly believed that they were likely to receive relief funds, after the first batch of over one hundred people left, people continued to come one after another. It is said that soldiers and monks accounted for a considerable number of them. The Supervision Committee's office was in a state of chaos for a time, as if it was surrounded. Fortunately, the office handled it properly and no accidents occurred, and people were still going to register until late at night.

<p>Three Days for the Whole Trip</p>
<p>American Pastor Talks About the Current Situation in the Communist Area</p>
<p>Religious Freedom Has Not Been Violated</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, an American pastor, Bo Peng, 72 years old, arrived in Shanghai from Xuzhou. Pastor Brown has been preaching in Xuzhou for 37 years and has a hospital. This time, he came to Shanghai to find a way to deal with the lack of medicine. He took a truck from Xuzhou to the canal area, and then took a civilian boat south along the canal, which only took three days for the whole trip. According to him, after the Communist army occupied Xuzhou, the work of the church was not hindered, the hospital was still open as usual, and the school was on winter vacation, and some teachers had to receive training. Some Communist troops were stationed in primary schools, and some entered Catholic churches, but they did not forcibly occupy civilian houses. Religious freedom has obviously not been violated. Chinese people still come to Brown's church to worship. Although there are Communist troops stationed in other churches, they can still openly state their beliefs. However, he had heard that religious activities were indeed banned in two remote small towns outside the railway line.</p>
<p>The Communist army did not restrict his actions. When he left Xuzhou, he planned to get a "pass", but the Communist army said, "The Japanese wanted a pass, and the Kuomintang also wanted a pass, but we don't need this kind of trouble."</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation in Xuzhou, he said that most of the shops have not opened, but street vendors are active. Silver dollars are worth 24,000 yuan in banknotes from the Beihai Bank, and the price is very stable. Gold yuan coupons can still be circulated for one or two months, but the price fluctuates greatly. The city's power supply is better than during the Kuomintang's occupation. The redistribution of land has not yet been implemented. The Communist army told him that there is no need to forcibly implement land reform. Trains have also been restored. They can travel west to Zhengzhou for 250 miles, south to Suxian for 70 miles, north to Jinan for 120 miles, and east to Haizhou for 75 miles, but they all run at night.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] A robbery occurred yesterday at 4:00 PM at the home of Chen Zhao Guiying, resident of No. 42, Italian Lane, Changyang Road. Three robbers, all speaking the Ningbo dialect, one wielding a handgun, entered the house and immediately forced the homeowner to a corner. They removed a gold-inlaid rattan bracelet and two gold rings from her hand. As they were searching, the homeowner's daughter, Chen Maomao, returned home. Realizing the situation, she slipped out and ran to the intersection of Dalian Road to report to traffic police officer Zhao Jinshan, No. 3092, for assistance. Zhao immediately drew his gun and went with her. At the entrance of the lane, the three robbers were emerging in single file after the robbery. The leading robber immediately opened fire to resist arrest. Zhao, caught off guard, was the first to be hit and injured. However, he persevered and bravely pursued, returning fire. A total of more than ten shots were exchanged, resulting in one of the robbers being hit by three bullets and falling to the ground. The uninjured robbers then picked him up and continued to flee north along Changyang Road, while the injured police officer, wounded in the leg, collapsed after pursuing them for dozens of steps. The Tilanqiao Police Sub-bureau received a report and immediately dispatched Sub-bureau Chief Huang Yinglong, Judicial Section Chief Zhang Zhaosu, Section Member Wang Zhi, Patrol Officer Ju Junde, and others to the scene to conduct a blockade and search. The injured police officer was sent to the hospital. At about 5:00 PM, the bureau received a report that a man with a gunshot wound, accompanied by a young woman, had gone to Gongji Hospital for treatment. Officers were dispatched, and the man tried to escape at the Zhabu Road Bridge but was apprehended. He identified himself as Zhu Yunzhang, 27, from Yuyao. The young woman was identified as his niece, Ge Zhufeng. When questioned about the origin of the gunshot wound, he was evasive. The police, suspecting his involvement, took both of them to the bureau for interrogation. Zhu confessed to robbing Chen Zhao Guiying's house, but refused to reveal the names of his accomplices. Finally, the police learned from his niece's statement that Zhu lived at No. 32 Yuqing Lane, East Changzhi Road. They immediately rushed there and confiscated a handgun with five bullets in the chamber, another thirty bullets, and some of the stolen goods. A man feigning illness, Ge Zongxiang, was also apprehended in the room. After investigation at the bureau, it was revealed that Ge was also one of the accomplices. Ge then revealed that another accomplice was Zhu's younger brother, Zhu Shouying, who lived at No. 1 Tongsheng Lane, Xi'an Road. He was arrested and more stolen goods were recovered.

<h3 id="e93">City Chamber of Commerce Again Cables the Executive Yuan: Requests the Opening of Yarn and Cloth Transportation to the South <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Transshipment Commercial Association, regarding the ban on yarn and cloth transportation to the south, which affects people's livelihoods and industrial and commercial affairs, requests assistance in negotiating the lifting of the ban. They sent a cable to the Executive Yuan yesterday stating: "Investigating the measures restricting yarn and cloth transportation to the south hinders industrial and commercial development, increases the difficulty of clothing for the people of South China, and is more harmful than beneficial. After repeated appeals, it was ordered to be abolished in November 1937. Unexpectedly, after only two months of free transportation, the previous order was suddenly reinstated, making people feel at a loss. Since the turning point in the overall situation, it has been difficult to sell Shanghai yarn and cloth in the vast areas of North China. Only the corner of South China has a small amount of room for maneuver, but now even this path has been blocked, causing the entire textile industry to suffocate. This cannot be explained. Government agencies are evacuating south, but the transportation of daily necessities such as yarn and cloth is restricted to the south, which is contradictory. Moreover, the scope of transportation to the south includes Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. Guangdong and Yunnan only have one or two yarn factories, while Guizhou and Guangxi have no yarn factories. The disparity between supply and demand will further exacerbate the difficulty of clothing in those provinces. To say that this is suppressing prices is a complete contradiction. This cannot be explained. The number of troops stationed in the city has increased, and the cost of non-staple food is enormous. Recently, it was proposed that various industries share the burden, with the textile industry bearing the most. In addition to taxes, a large burden has been added. However, on the one hand, its vitality is stifled, and its sales are restricted. This cannot be explained. Therefore, we do not hesitate to sell out our assets and telegraphically submit this to your esteemed court for review. We respectfully request that you examine the above-mentioned sections of the previous telegram and abolish the measures of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce restricting yarn and cloth transportation to the south, which would be for the public convenience, etc."</p>
