<h3>國是會談在京舉行對團結革新已獲有結論　和談大計正在詳細研討</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕李代總統爲硏商和談大計，促進團結，全面革新政治，而邀集之重要會商，因中樞要員，各地方百長均已先後齊集首都，遂於一日下午四時在傅厚崗官邸正式開始舉行，被邀參加者計有孫科·吳鐵城·于右任·童冠賢。居正·邵力子·何應欽·張治中·徐永昌·顧祝同·吳忠信·白崇禧及重要部會首長等廿餘人，張羣亦於下機後卽趕往參加。會中，李代總統晋說明政府談和之誠意與決心，而目前之內部團結與革新政治，尤有必要。與會各要員亦就當前大局各項問題提出意見，詳加硏討，李代總統並在官邸請與會各要員晚餐，迄九時始畢，連日李代總統與各要員個別會談，對和談及對內團結，政治革新等問題，均已獲致若干結論。一日下午之會，使此項意見已更臻具體化，聞此項會談可能繼續舉行二三次，程潛二日抵京後，亦將參加商討。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕立法院長童冠賢一日參加李代總統官邸會商後，復于晚九時半左右晉謁李代總統，談一刻鐘辭出。又資委會委員長孫越崎，亦于一日晚晋謁李代總統，有所報吿。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京一日電〕消息靈通方面稱，共方遲不指派代表，因有若干細則尙待處理，一俟就緒，卽可在北平開始正式談判。大約在一月內當可採取積極步驟。又悉：上海和平代表園已在原則上獲致下列協議：（一）談判在北平舉行，（二）國共兩方各派代表四人，（三）如欲增派代表，雙方應同等增加。李代總統是否將保留目前之「正式代表」四人，尙不可知，惟邵力子將任代表團長似已確定，此外則爲張治中，黃紹竑，鍾天心三人。聞共方願意考慮三三三方案，由國共及無黨派領袖以同等名額參加新政府，惟李濟琛領導之國民黨革命委員會是否列入國民黨名額內，現尙未知。</p>
<p>盛傳中共任命和談代表四人</p>
<p>〔路透社南京一日電〕此間盛傳中共業已任命周恩來，董必武，葉劍英，林彪四人爲和談代表。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於和談之展望，據某關係人士表示：由上海和平代表團所携回之條件中，可看出中共對懲辦戰犯，並不過於重視；反之，對於整軍問題，則絲毫不肯放鬆。三年前政協整軍方案中，規定國共之軍力比例爲五比一，今日雖不致完全倒轉，但中共要求佔有大部份軍力</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京一日電〕接近上海和平代表團者稱（十）共方已不再堅特懲辦戰犯爲恢復和談之一條件，且對整編軍隊方面亦願作若干讓步。另悉：中共領袖間現有「赦免」戰犯名單中一部份要員之傾向，但堅持必須懲辦宋，孔，陳，蔣等所謂「四大豪門」。同時，此間消息靈通人士稱：蔣總統之親信現正力謀勸渠出國遊歷，藉以消除和平壁壘，或者重新執政，親自媾和，但均遭蔣氏冷待。前浙江省主席陳儀，卽因此而被拘禁於上海。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京一日電〕據傳：一九四六年馬歇爾使華時，國共會談之各記錄業已找出，並正仔細硏究，俾尋求一方式，使在現在可以接受。據報吿，在馬歇爾使華時國共兩方部份或全部達成協議之各點，正在列表，中同時，最不同意的及終使馬歇爾失敗之各主要問題，亦正同樣列表，以爲在將來會談中應予避免之障碍。此等報吿尙未經官方證實。</p>
<h3>政院將局部改組　孫科辭職之說已成過去　各部會首長人選將有設動或補實</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕據政府某高級人士透露：行政院之局部改組，勢在必行，孫科院長由穗返京，參與李代總統所召集之重要會商，討論當前時局問題外，政院局部改組問題，亦爲孫氏向李代總統請示之主題。此事如能在京作一決定，仍將循過去慣例，經在橞之中政會通過後再行發表，惟發表日期恐不及在本週以內。據稱：孫科辭職之說已成過去，李代總統苦心孤詣促成政府內部之團結，並竭力疏通各委負，對富前問題之一致意見，已獲相當成就。孫科繼續主持政院，卽屬共中之一例。至立院方面對孫科之不滿，因吳鐵城孫科兩氏之先後北返，數度個別洽談，情形已不若外傳之嚴重。兩氏之施政方針，因秘書長端本愷尙在廣州，本週內或不能向立院提出報吿，而須延至下週。政院局部改組原因，亦現各方對政院一二首長表示不滿有關。此外已表示堅決辭職之部會首長，如社會部長谷正綱，交通部長兪大維及由次長代理部務之代理敎育部長陳雪屛，司法行政部長趙琛等，均有提出繼任人選或補實之必要。該高級人士相信局部改組實行時，可能有較多之更動，現政院首長之在首都者，除院長孫科外，有副院長兼外長吳鐵城，內長洪蘭友（在滬卽返），工商劉維熾，財長徐堪（已由穗赴滬），地政吳尙鷹，水利鍾天心，國防徐永昌，敎育陳雪屛，糧食關吉王，資源孫越崎等，廣州方面則由秘書長端木愷主持，惟端木愷亦將於短期內來京一行。二日應舉行之政院例會，因院長副院長均不在穗將停開一次。至外傳政務會議將移京舉行說，經記者向有關方面探詢，似尙無此決定。今後是否有此必要，尙須視時局發展如何而定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京一日電〕和平討論頻繁聲中，京中一般注意力仍集中於行政院長孫科的是否將辭職，抑服從公意將行政院遷回南京，以及立法委員是否仍堅持反孫。某接近孫氏的人士稱：孫院長原擬在南京逗留一周，但現在可能改變其原定計劃。最近數日來，吳鐵城幾乎無日不在招待具有影響力量的立委，顯然地，其旨在爲孫科緩頰。但據一日探悉：許多立法委員，至今仍堅持對政府提出不信任投票。</p>
<h3>平津週圍國軍經共軍改編竣事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中共電臺北平消息：平津週圍之國軍，二月廿一日已結束其原有的指揮系統，正式隸屬人民解放軍平津前綫司令部指揮。移接手續係由郭宗汾代表傳作義辦理，國軍師級以上軍官，均被召參加此一會議。共軍改編方案中規定：（一）結束原屬華北剿總之第四·第九兩個兵團部與八個軍部的三級指揮機構，官員編入共軍平津前綫司令部與各兵團部及各軍部，其所屬的廿五個師，則改編爲人民解放軍獨立師，各特種部隊與共軍特種部隊合編，（二）國軍政工人員，訓練後可錄用。（三）凡分配於共軍工作之本人及家屬，得與共軍享同樣待遇。（四）願意學習深造之國軍軍官，按其工作職位與程度，分班組織學習。（五）凡願回籍之國軍軍官，按原薪發給三月薪餉及乘車車票，准許移帶私人財物家爲及一二名護兵同行；凡在共區居住之軍官，回籍後，可分得應有的一份土地，依照其土地法大綱之規定處理，但今後需遵守民主政府法令。至其過去對於農民的行爲如何，一槪不加追究。此外，並一律發給「參加北平和平解放證明書」一份，以資證明。</p>
<h3>重慶號軍艦由長江下游駛煙台</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京一日電〕中國最大軍艦重慶號，數日前由長江下游防地，開往山東中共控制口岸煙台，今日已由此間可靠華人方面護實，此次離防，顯係有人偽造命令，據此間海軍司令部稱：不知該艦脫逃之事，桂永淸現在上海調查，詳情無可發表。</p>
<h3>軍餉發銀元</h3>
<p>兵士二元五角　上將爲十二元</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京一日電〕自本月開始，軍餉將改發銀元。餉級自二元五角至十二元不等，士兵每人每月二元五角，上將每人每月十二元。</p>
<h3>張羣由渝抵首都　謂胡宗南調防入川無其事　地方經濟改革方案商討中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕重慶綏靖主任張舉偕副主任兼參謀長蕭毅肅等一行，於一暮色蒼茫中，自渝乘追雲號專機經衛陽抵京。政府各要員因多已參加李代德統下午四時召集之重要會議，僅白崇禧等十餘人，到塲歡迎，張氏座機係一日晨九時半自渝起飛，下午二時許降落極陽，候迎自長沙赴衡之湘主席程潛同機飛京，因程氏未能如時趕到，旋復於下午三時一刻繼續飛京，於六時抵達，張氏在機塲稱：西南各省及四川現均甚爲安定，外傳胡宗南部已調防入川，絕無其事。劉文輝部調至成都事，渠本人已有聲明，並無外傳嚴重之意義。至四川主席卽將更動之說，尤非事實。本人就任重慶綏靖主任。今僅十日，日前召集之西南軍政會議，僅係就西南軍政情形加以檢討，並計劃今後西南政治經濟應如何改革，惟就職不到十天，一切還說不上。此次應召而來，係應中央諮詢，述述職亦談不到。記者詢以西南有無經濟等新方案携來，張氏稱現尙在商討中。渝綏署擬倣效華中成立一政務委員會，以指導轄區之政務。張氏並稱：西南各省並未考慮發行地方幣劵，現中央財政改革方案業已公佈，希望實行後能有良好效果，使地方財政收支趨於平衡，談及和平問題時，張氏强調西南各省對和戰均聽命於中央，記者詢以和平有無希望，張氏稱：和平爲老百姓和我們所需要，大家都要和平，和平自有希望。記者再詢以和平如何始能實現時，張氏特別指出：必須全面努力，如僅局部努力或我勞力你不努力，則和平仍難望實現。張氏下榻外部宿舍，晚九時半張治中，白祟禧兩氏會往訪長談。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶一日電〕張羣此行將在京逗留二星期。</p>
<h3>程潛今飛京</h3>
<p>〔本報長沙一日電〕迎程潛專機，一日下午降落衡陽，程氏於晚十二時乘粵漢車赴衡，二日上午可起飛。唐鴻烈·楊繼榮·劉遠柔等隨行。</p>
<h3>天津大公報停刊被改為進步日報</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中共廣播稱：天津大公報已由該報同人改爲「進步日報」向津市軍事管制委負會登記後，於二月廿七日創刋。該電台廣播中指陳，該報「在北洋軍閥時代，爲依附軍閥，官僚，賣辦統制集團，蔣匪介石當政後，又為國民黨政學系之機關報。念年來，大公報所表現之基本立塲，爲反人民，反民主，」故該報同人「由於認識大公報之反動失聯」，決定停辦，「棄此臭名，改用新名」。按：大公報爲中國大報中歷史悠久者之一，在津創刋，迄今三十餘年，目前該報在國內發刋者，除上海版外，尙有電慶版及海外之香港版，至天津進步日報之主持人，據聞爲前大公報之女職員楊剛。又該廣播電台稱：天津新生報博民報及漢英報三家報紙已分別獲得該市軍事管制委負會之允許，暫行出版博民報已於十二日前復刋，新生·漢英兩報乃在最近出版。</p>

<h3>自由平等同樣需要！</h3>
<p>—人民和平的主要原則—</p>
<p>顏惠慶氏一行的上海和平代表團今天上午回上海了。上海人民自必表示衷誠的感慰，並寄以深切的期望。我們人民所渴求的和平是人民和平，而其中要原則應該是：自由平等同樣需要。</p>
<p>我們人民之所以要和平，當然爲的是要生存。然而生存要有生存的意義。生存的意義，就是在於自由與平等，二者缺一不可。近來常聽到人說：「政府轄區內有自由而無平等，中共區域內有平等而無自由」。其實道些觀察，也不過是籠統的皮相之談，所謂「有」，所謂「無」，究竟到了什麼界限，也都很難說。然而就從這一句浮雕的批判，可以看出一般人實在感覺自由與平等是同樣需要的。惟其他們感覺自由平等彷彿魚與熊掌，欲得血兼之，所以對這兩個區域內的現實生活，似乎都有些不滿。惟其如此，所以希望有一個和平的政治環境，纔可使大家得到自由平等。</p>
<p>在今天的中國，在戰亂未已的中國，老實說，不論在什麼地方，自由與平等，恐怕都未必能爲人民所完全享有。這並非我們要求過奢之談，當和平沒有完全實現以前，此亦勢所不免。甚而至於在世界上兩大集團主角冷戰未已之際，世界人類要全都享受到自由與平等，恐怕也還是奢望。</p>
<p>姑且不談他國，只就我們自己的實情來看一看吧。</p>
<p>先說平等：政府轄區內，民生主義至今還沒有認眞實行，過去或且在有意無意間向着相反的道路走，以致十年以來，富者愈富，貧者愈貧，中產一級幾被完全摧毀，這當然是經濟生活不平等的社會病態；「無平等」三字的批判，不能不說是中肯的。照理，中共區域內，不管他們實行共產主義或新民主主義，應該如宣傳所說確有其平等了。我們暫不必列舉因淸算鬥爭而被迫由共區裏逃出來的難胞，他們當時怎樣過着不平等的生活，痛苦之至，而至於離鄉背井，啼飢號寒。即使最近從北平傳來一鱗半爪的消息裏，我們也彷彿可以瞭望到若干不甚平等的景象。六國飯店的豪華，東興樓六十席的盛宴，誠如某報所描寫，「酒酣耳熱時，却也忘記了漫天的烽火！」歡呼豪飲之餘，不知街頭野外，還有得不到小米　　頭的同胞否耶？假使再與天津某些工人要求加工資减工時，反而得到工資打八折，工時加兩小時的結果，兩相對照，平等又在哪裏？</p>
<p>中共區域內，沒有自由，幾乎盡人所知。儘管有人想用種種方法捧塲，天花亂墜的說那裏怎樣的自由自在，但終究遮掩不住事實，道聽途說的不必舉，只要看美國記者一概被禁採訪發電，成舍我君的世界日報世界晚報被封，（益世報和其他各報更不必說，）就連天津的大公報也受着「反動報紙」的封號，而被迫改爲「進步報」，應該可以知道言論自由新聞自由這一類名詞，在中共區域內是絕對用不到的了。其他居住自由，信仰自由，通信自由……等等，是否毫無干涉，當可有事實的證明。政府轄區內，雖還有人喊着要爭自由，至少在言論自由這一點上，要比共區裏自由得多。但是，在戰爭狀態沒有終止，和平尙未眞正實現以前，牽於事實，的確也有許多限制人民自由的法令與行動。戒嚴令的不能停止執行，軍事間諜的繼續逮捕，未曾登記的報紙刊物不許出版，諸如此類，我們也不能不認爲人民還沒有完全自由。</p>
<p>因此，我們以爲和談開始的時候，雙方當局應該多多體察人民的願望，與其致力於爭論如何分配地盤，分配政權，不如注意於如何決定政策，使人民能够享有充分的自由與眞正的平等。</p>

<p>〔本報台北一日電」陳主席今於行政會議開幕詞中，述及停止報館業配紙之理由稱：紙業公司因此項配紙年虧七十億元以上，以致無法增產，渠爲顧及紙業公司成本，及避免借此操縱與論及舞弊之嫌，曁現正需大量紙張印刷敎科書之三項理由，故斷然採此措施。陳氏今午招待省垣各報負責人便餐，介紹新任新聞處長吳錫澤，並對停止配紙問題再作解釋。</p>

<p>〔合衆社曼谷一日電〕暹羅政府一日宣佈：週末叛變已完全敉平，在廿七日晚卽佔據皇官的叛民中，三十人業已被捕。據非官方估計，在戰鬥中至少已死傷五十人。政府公報中稱：被捕之人數共達七十人，但並未列出叛變領袖的姓氏。</p>

<p>同時孫氏與今日其他就該計劃發言者相同，表示願意與渠所稱之「對聯合國之挑戰」合作。英代表梅修保證支持美國之計劃，並稱，美國可供給技術協助，以參加該計劃之實施，然美國由於其自身之財政困難，故不能作財政上之援助。比代表蘭琴霍夫呼籲一致之國際行動，以資助落後區域之經濟開發。蘇聯集團預料必將批抨此項計劃爲美帝國主義之又一行動。</p>

<h3>北站火车上两怪箱分藏支解七段男屍　押还人举止豪华由杭抵沪自称擬转赴常州　路局正派警随车侦缉凶犯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市北火車站昨日發生一恐怖離奇之箱屍案，屍體支解成七段，分藏兩皮箱內·該「箱屍」係從杭州來，擬往常州去，負責運送「箱屍』來滬之恐怖人物，爲一舉止豪華之中裝客。兩路警務處於發覺後，立卽動員全體便衣刑警四出偵査，入晚聞已獲得重要綫索，不難立刻破案，全案詳情日內亦卽可大白。</p>
<p>昨日下午二時許，滬杭綫由杭州來滬之第二十四次特快車，駛抵上北站，列車進久月台後，旅客紛紛下車。其第二節客車中，有一身穿黑呢翠袍，足登黃紋皮皮鞋，手提公事皮包之中年男性乘客，於停車後卽招××號行李伕入車中搬取卅八吋之黃色軟胎大皮箱兩隻。下車後，該旅客並不出站，自稱急須轉車去常州。該行李伕吿以此時離開車尚早，不妨先往票房購票。而該客復稱：先送行李上車佔好座位，願在車中等候開車。行李伕乃順從該客意思，將渠領至甫停靠月台之京滬綫第七十四次滬常區間車上，並將兩皮箱在行李架上安置妥當，然後離去。此時距開車尚有二小時餘，且車上未標明車次，故車中並無其他乘客。至三時四十分，淸潔伕上車打掃，見車中闐無一人，而行李架上留置有兩大型黃皮箱，淸潔伕以爲旅客遺忘之物，循例報吿在站值勤路警，該路警卽偕同清潔伕入車察看，見兩皮箱甚新，皮料亦屬上等，但未上鎖，因啓疑竇。但彼無權開箱啓視，當卽報吿第八分駐所郭巡官。郭偕往，亦以如此皮箱，內必藏貴重衣物，何不上鎖，更不應無人看守，亦絕不類旅客遺忘之物，遂令淸潔伕搬下第一隻皮箱，推起箱蓋，見箱中上覆白布，棉花。郭巡官以手探之，軟綿而有彈性，中一圓形物較硬，拉去白布，赫然竟爲一男性頭頗·淸潔伕在旁不禁失聲駭叫，郭巡官禁其聲張，囑嚴守秘密，並繼續翻視，頭顱之下爲胸脯及二臂。第二箱爲下體及兩脚。屍體共分七段，完全赤裸。郭檢視完畢，不動聲色，仍將兩箱置放原處，令路警暗中監視，一面回所報吿。金所長得報，立卽傳報上級，警務處卽動員全體便衣人負，分別出發偵査，並另派幹員隨乘七十四次車秘密監視兩箱，杭州，常州兩處亦均已佈置完密之偵査網。晚七時許，警務處接獲出勤刑警報吿，謂已尋得重要綫索，現正循此綫索努力追査中。</p>
<p>據路局警務方面推測箱中男屍年約卅餘，此案可能爲桃色兇殺案或綁票案，兇犯決非一人，因檢得屍體支解處，光滑平整，顯係以極鋒利之刀斧砍下，且屍塊血汚甚少，可能曾用水冲洗。根據種種跡象，可斷定爲一有嚴密計劃之預謀兇殺案，兇手亦必爲異常精細陰險之人云。</p>

<h3>公敎二月份待遇七五倍尚未發齊</h3>
<p>公敎人員二月份待遇，於二月九日經在廣州召開之政務會議決定調整爲七十五倍，迄今已歷兼旬，仍未發下。在滬各機關均僅袛領到十五倍，且有僅按六倍領到者，員工窘迫萬分，甚於往昔。昨有若干機關收到國庫署之支付書通知聯，經分別向中央銀行國庫局洽領，但國庫局負責人表示，以尚未收到國庫署簽發之支付書，不允支付，　候已久僅敷維持數日之七十五倍，竟儘可望而不可卽，以致各機關員工，羣情惶惶，頗爲憤慨。嗣經中央各機關員工聯誼會推派代表向國庫局交涉，結果對於原在上海之中央機關已收到七十五倍之支付書者，可備具公函附支付書，送經國庫局長批准，卽可先行領支。</p>

<h3>章乃器胞妹索婚約糾紛　自相戀至感情破裂過程僅短短三個月　雙方表示決依法提出控訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕女醫師章雪琴與其同業李銘醫師因戀愛決裂而至衝突，互投靜安寺警分局申訴後，現雖經人出面調解，但雙方表示，決依法提出控訴，俾求公正解決，故此一曲折之糾紛可能於日內另有發展。</p>
<p>章係章乃器之胞妹，畢業日本東京帝大醫科，曾任寗波市府衛生科長，現設有新生醫院一所。雖已三十六歲，尚屬獨身。去年十一月初，渠因高血壓症常赴市立第六醫院撿查身體，得識李姓護士小姐，某日李邀章散步公園，途經長樂路六七二弄廿五號李寓，復又邀其入內休息，此時章突感不適，李謂其樓下卽係李銘醫師診所，當卽請李登樓爲章施行注射，章李自此相識。自該日起李銘遂逐日往章宅代其診疾，噓寒問暖之餘，更自購藥品贈章服用，備極殷勤，至十一月十四日止，章共注射四十二針，病已漸見痊可，十四日爲章生辰，李卽購備香燭禮物</p>
<p>前來祝嘏</p>
<p>章留共晚宴，酒酣耳熱，李遂吐露愛慕之意，此後兩相往還，感情日增，至十二月廿八日章母忌辰時，李親携楮儀致祭，當晚正式向章求婚，同時更要求先行同居，章頗不謂然，吿以相愛期在白首，婚禮必須舉行，李沉吟良久，復提議於陰歷年歲首先行訂婚，儀式不妨廢除，章表示首肯。陰歷新年中李曾坦白吿章，謂其經濟情况欠佳，並力言卜者謂章「帮夫運」好，故促早日締約，同時更囑章擬一婚書，俾簽署後卽可了事。正月十一日李來，章將其寫就之婚約示李，上有「我倆志同道合，願永矢愛好，共赴國難，爲祖國効命，將來如有一方背約，他方應將其全部財產作爲賠償」等語。李</p>
<p>閱後笑稱</p>
<p>：「此中可再加一句，女方准許男方自由納妾」。言訖遂將約據收藏，其時已屆宵禁時間，李出門後適逢雨雪，翌日卽以臥病聞。十二日章以不便探恙，遂遺其表姪曾任虹口警分局長之廖公劭之妻妹代往慰視，並帶去函件寄語珍攝，廖之妻妹年華二九，秀麗不俗，方在某產科學校讀書，詎渠與李謀面後，李竟一見鍾情，着意溫存，嗣復經數度接談，渠竟亦墮入情網。此時章舊疾復發，榻上聞傭人私議李與廖之妻妹親暱情狀，</p>
<p>大啓疑</p>
<p>因廖曾有納其妻妹爲妾之議，乃召廖之妻妹嚴詢究竟，渠亦不表否認，並謂；李先生說你偌大年紀，還寫情書，怎不害羞？同時更自陳：廖·李均已四十許人，與其嫁廖爲妾，寗作李之正室。章聞語一憤幾絕，嗣卽多方探聽李之經歷，得知李鄕間已有妻室，並已娶媳，李勝利前原名李明，後改李銘等等，渠認爲李行爲不檢，遂決意往李寓索還函扎及婚約，至則因李拒絕交出，致起衝突，紛亂中章又爲李之鄰舍陳祥能等毆傷，結果乃扭入靜安寺警局。</p>

<h3>「建設杭州」聲中莫辜負大好春光</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿七日訊〕西子湖邊的楊柳已經途上了嫩綠色，臘梅謝了，春梅開了，黃龍洞的一枝桃花，居然搶先地滿滿的開着。野鴨羣嬉戲在西子湖中，牠們已經知道這是個溫暖醉人的季節。雖然大自然沒有辜負了這杭州，但是住居在杭州的人們，已經戳破了寗靜的心境，那樣不安地關心着時事。是的，浙江已成了江南的第一道防綫，杭州已是僅差於最前綫的前綫，共軍已在長江的北岸，而浙江各縣，也現着不安的情態，天台不久前被土共政佔了二天，三門也一度被土共攻佔。杭州隣近的富陽，臨安都時常有土共出沒，傳言流　，不免有風聲鶴唳的景象。</p>
<p>特殊份子　隨處皆是</p>
<p>以杭州來講穿着不整齊軍裝與制服的人到處皆是，這許多人是不是隸屬於正式部隊和學校，也無從辦別。杭州的各報無以名之，名之爲「特殊份子」，這許多特殊份子終日無所事事，看電影，坐酒菜館茶館，乘公共汽車兜風，洗澡，理髮，都一概免費，甚至吃用了以後還要店主人給些錢他們。在這種情形之下，理髮店一度停了市，洗澡堂請求保障，電影院大有不能支持之槪，公共汽車公司也想停止營業。</p>
<p>隨着這亂烘烘的景色市內的盜案也不斷的發生，應橋附近的吳牙巷，惠興路的平安坊，松木塲，兩天以前的長壽里，都先先後後的發生了搜刦搶掠的情形，尤其後兩次是蒙面盜，他們都有木壳槍。這幾件案子，都發生在二月份內，警察當局雖然嚴令破案，但到底還要費一些功夫。</p>
<p>路上瘡疤　路旁汚水</p>
<p>本來，春天到了，杭州的商家正是抖擻起精神的時候，霓虹燈日夜點燃着，一切土產都堆得滿滿的，每家幾乎都有一具無綫電擴音機，裏邊放送着紹興戲的唱詞，愉快，興奮，充溢在枕州市上。今年的春天確有些特殊，店家沒有舖張，卽是特有的清潔而闊寬的湖濱路，英士路，延齡路，也是一塊塊瘡疤，一個個窟窿，路兩旁的　　汚水流溢着。原來轆轆的軍車和「〇〇」號的小轎車，吉普車，都要到這幾條馬路上來施勁的開駛着，不久以前湖濱路靠湖的一邊停滿了十輪大卡車，東裏邊一切飲食起居竟成了臨時的宿舍，現在終算開走了。但是湖濱路的破爛，已是不能避免。各個名勝區因着目前的一切情形，所以也沒有再加以修茸點綴。到杭州來玩的人並不是沒有，有的是逃難，經過杭州，順便遊一遊山水，有的是特殊份子遊覽山水，也有的是從上海來遊山玩水的，不過這已經是少數了。「三冬靠一春」的杭州，今年的春季恐怕比往常的淡月還不如了。</p>
<p>復常以後　建設杭州</p>
<p>在這亂烘烘的時候，文化活動倒也沒有落後，例如戲劇節的演出展覽，以及不斷的話劇演出，又有音樂會，舞蹈會，各種座談會，還有子民藝術研究所，這個藝術研究所聽說內有音樂·戲劇·美術·雕塑·舞蹈等部門。這許多文化活動，也就是配合着建社文化城的呼籲。聽說裏西湖大禮堂舊址的地主，願意把地皮捐出來建造藝術館，同時還願意捐出全部房屋的鐵窗。湖濱民衆敎育館的禮堂，已經任市長指定爲永久話劇塲。不過所有的演出都沒有賺到錢，原因看白戲的人太多。</p>
<p>八十天內　工作可觀</p>
<p>杭州的行政官任顯羣走了以後，交給秘書長徐雄飛代理。徐氏曾對記者說：「我不過是過渡，將來還是想去學校敎書·」徐氏這樣說，自然不致長此做下去的，繼起何人？到今天記者寫稿時止，尚未知道。不過任氏任內，雖然只有短短的八十天，但確然做了一些事，例如調整公敎人員待遇，與老百姓接近，修整平民區街道等，本來聽說非但把舊有的柏油路要舖整一新，而且還要增舖柏油路，現在任氏走了，我們企望着新市長能够來整理。自然新市長其他的實任也很重大，比如秩序的維持和平民生活的顧及等等。</p>
<p>我們相信，這亂烘烘的情景不過是暫時的狀態，不久以後，一定會趨於正常的。我們希望在恢復正常狀態以後，好好地來建設杭州，莫辜負了這大好的春光，大好的自然，大好的環境！</p>
<h3>驚心動魄的一幕　華覮山事件　幾個地主鄉長反叛經過</h3>
<p>— 張錫端</p>
<p>四川是一般人所謂的安樂土，不想在這安樂土上，尤其是在抗戰的燈塔旁邊的重慶附近，也會禍起蕭墻發生了變亂——華　山之亂。華鎣山這個地方，初無藉藉名，在今日是重慶人驚心動魄的一個名詞。</p>
<p>川東寶庫</p>
<p>華鎣山是個頗爲生疏的地方，因爲那是幾個縣份的邊界和幾條河川的發源地和分水嶺；這山是大巴山在四川東北邊境分出的一條支脈，從巴河南岸越過渠縣，大竹·廣安·岳池·鄰水·合川等縣境，一直斜伸到和重慶一水之隔的江北近郊山峽地方，長度共六百多華里，海拔一千五百多公尺，山厚四十至八十華里，山中全是高崖深壑野樹荒林，可耕地除捲洞門一帶山谷外，其餘就很少了。從前山中寺廟很多，現在因爲地面不靖，香火零落，僧人星散，（只有寶頂一地尚如故。）山中物產豐富，被開採的祗有煤和造紙用的竹子，因爲祗有小規模的土法開採，產量也就微不足道。而山上木材深厚，礦產豐富，以經濟的觀點看，華鎣山是川東的「寶庫」，是四川的「福地」。</p>
<p>但是，連年不斷地土共出沒，再加上今年政治性的叛亂，這片福地，竟成了川東的「蘭尾」了</p>
<p>攻守兩難</p>
<p>華　山旣有如此的深邃，荒凉，險惡，而嘉陵江·渠江·涪江扇形的在山西南面展開，更增加山的複雜性。各縣的政治轄區，犬牙交錯，聯繫管理困難，形成化外，山區若干年來總是亡命者的樂園，再加濱河及平原地帶的富庶，給以宵小無上的便利。但是山中山高林密，又有大霧，是個攻守兩難的地方，進剿者攻擊連絡都極困難，而捕給又是不易，絕不適宜長時間的屯駐，而士共如無良好的根據地，藏身亦非易事。</p>
<p>富紳起事</p>
<p>這次華鎣山變亂的領導人物，全是資產階級或地方行政幹部，這班人在理論上應是共黨的淸算目標，而居然會由他們舉事，寗非怪事！</p>
<p>現在我們來叙述這些人物吧。</p>
<p>最先起事的是岳池河東伏龍鄕的現任鄕長張蜀駿，年二十二歲，是個擁田二千多畝的富紳，曾任三民主義靑年團的區隊長，他的父親被土共慘殺，因此他家築有堅固的砦寨，並養有家丁，備有槍砲（有機槍衝鋒槍）。據說張在起事不久前還親率家丁捕殺土共，但他忽在八月廿一日晚間召集佃戶，當面燒去全部田契和大批衣物，以示土地公有，和同甘共苦，藉以取得佃戶的擁戴，次日卽正式起事，慫恿他起事的是他的妻弟合川人陳正（曾任重慶大學自治會主席），參與起事的有附近的部份保長，小學校長，敎員，和農民等三百餘人外，還有一個是楊奚勤，楊是岳池新三中學校的校長，這個學校是于右任爲紀念他父親在岳池經商而創立，他們的番號是民主聯軍華鎣山縱隊第七支隊，指導員楊奚勤，張是支隊司令員。</p>
<p>金子鄉長</p>
<p>第二個變亂的是合川金子鄉長陳伯純，他年二十六，曾在金陵大學肄業，他之加入共黨是因他的愛人和他的妹夫羅又新（陝北大學畢業）。他在鄉時就以抗兵拒糧爲號召，博得鄕民的擁戴。後來合川縣長懷疑他時，令該鄉重選鄕長四次仍都是他當選，後因他到重慶領無綫電敗露，遂於八月二十五日起事。隨他起事的有鼓樓，繩溪，錢塘三鄕，人槍共四百多，編成三個步槍中隊，一個手槍中隊和一個機槍組，自稱民主聯軍華　山縱隊第四支隊，陳自任支隊司令員。</p>
<p>議員參加</p>
<p>第三個是武勝縣的參議員王屛藩，王是該縣石盤鄕的前任鄉長，年三十二，有田五六百畝，當陳伯純率領人槍由嘉陵江東岸北上會合時，他也在八月二十七日起事，人槍共三百多，番號是民主聯軍川東縱隊第三支隊，王是支隊司令員。</p>
<p>根據俘獲的人的口供和別的情報，證實他們預定同時發動，當時估計至少可發動五六千人，預備在華鎣山合城山武合山之間建立三個遊擊根據地，再向四外擴張，後因被政府覺察而迫不及待倉促舉事。另有一個由一化名老田的共黨親自指揮，原定去年中秋在渠縣，龍潭，捲洞，匯東等鄉發動，預計人槍一千八百餘，企圖進攻大竹或渠縣縣城，以獲取械彈，結果如期起事，二十日晚在鄧家灣的晚會，僅到三百多人，參與的幹部是附近的保長，保隊附，小學校長，敎員等，晚會中的口號是「分田」「廢借」「不當兵」「不納糧」，並有五六個鄕村婦女唱歜，唱特製的歌詞。番號是四川人民解放軍第六縱隊，老田是支隊司令員，參謀長何尚，老范是第三支隊司令員</p>
<p>裹槍脅人</p>
<p>開始舉事時，張蜀駿西渡渠河，陳伯純與王屛藩合股沿南充岳池的邊境北上，一路裏槍脅人，地方交通阻絕，各縣城築起巷戰工事，入晚時，家家關門閉戶，南充警察局長被打死了，好幾個縣長因此被記過。那時對其兵力無法估計，恐怖與謠言密佈民間，人民不是怕共黨，而是怕戰禍，對政府的力量，完全失去信心，甚至在重慶，也有山雨欲來風滿樓之勢。</p>
<p>一片恐怖</p>
<p>那時在合川南充武勝渠縣廣安大竹這一片區域，都充滿了恐怖與騷亂，各縣政府也出動了警察隊和自衛隊，大都因爲缺乏械彈及適宜的統一指揮而處於被動·重慶派來的內警總隊袛有二中隊，其中閔中隊在武勝的黑耳鄕和張蜀駿的一般，激戰了二小時，當塲擊斃其指導員楊奚勤和張的褒弟陳正，在大雨滂沱中，他們遺秦了十餘具屍首，一部份携武器狼狽逃去，這一戰成爲安定局面的鎭靜劑。</p>
<p>隱憂未弭</p>
<p>以後綏署朱主任又派來了內警第二總隊總隊長彭斌担任合川武勝等十一區華鎣山區淸剿指揮官，和一部份大兵，彭在九月八日趕到華　山區，他發佈了簡單的佈吿——「陣前拿獲者殺，投誠者准予自新」，一面嚴密部署指揮部隊圍剿。不到三十天，召降投降了七百多，生擒三百多，槍斃四十多人，繳獲各種槍支三百多支。陳伯純張蜀駿部全部瓦解，陳張潛逃未獲，王屛藩雙目失明自殺，袛有數十人尚散匿山中。</p>
<p>華鎣山的變亂平定了，而這塊土地仍是個不安的所在，以後禍患仍不能說完全消滅。西南各省民槍很多，每縣至少以千萬計，這些武器如能好好運用，未始不是强壯的力量，不然也是無窮的隱憂，因爲天災人禍政治不良各種原因，使人民鋌而走險，如再加上政治活動，那就一觸卽發，卽使幸而平定，而生命財產的損失，已是無法補救。</p>

<p>王啓昌問　胞弟王其明，廿一歲，服務於國防部人民服務總隊第一中隊。本年九月間，因鼻孔時常流血，請假返淮陰休養。不料於十二月二日淮陰又遭撤退，隻身流亡南下。在途十日，風霜饑寒飽受，又遭擠跌受踏，於十一日下午抵鎮。身體甚爲衰弱，胸部微痛，但仍行坐，幷未臥床。在親戚處住宿一夜，中二日又進稀飯，葡萄糖，於下午乘人力車投鎭恩沛醫院醫治，該院高恩沛醫師僅用聽筒，而幷朱詳加檢査身體各部情形，亦未測量體溫，卽斷云肺大葉炎，卽侖服以藥水，藥片，而注射一針，（不知何藥）又卽注射配尼西林一針。及至返回途中，已目光失神，前後約一小時而故。（一）該醫生未能詳細診斷，亦未索親屬保單，可見病勢幷不危險，而竟冒昧用藥致死，是否應負法律責任？（二）該醫生於其故後之次晨，尚索取手續費九十六元，只知要錢，玩忽人命，且本年內因過失殺人已五六次之多，歷受控吿在案，若此醫生，應受如何之懲處？</p>
<p>〔姜屛藩律師答〕（一）擊生有無過失致人於死資任，應以其診斷之結果是否與其所用之藥相符爲斷。（二）醫生索取醫藥費或手續費，爲其業務上應得之報酬，要與其有無過失致人於死之責任無關。如果該醫生確有過失致人於死情事，儘可依法吿訴，請求檢察官加以偵查。</p>

<h3>四種新鈔發行發後　國行全力帛緊銀根　拋售金匯紗布等在六億元以上</h3>
<p>中央銀行爲適應事實需要，昨日（一日）日開始發行一千元及五百元之大鈔。惟發行數額不多，故市面缺鈔現象，仍未解除。據悉：中央銀行爲緊縮信用，不擬將大鈔大量流出。昨（一日）日各行莊存款餘額，仍予百分之三十之限制。</p>
<p>當局宣佈緊縮金圓劵發行後，央行已於昨日發出大鈔四種。其中計千元劵二種，一係中央印製廠承印，一係中華書局承印。五百元券二種，一爲中央印製廠，一爲中華書局。在四種大鈔發行之同時，央行爲鎭壓大鈔發行後之物價狂漲，昨日曾全力抽緊銀根，並曾拋出鉅額外匯移轉證和黃金。於是銀根緊勢益甚，暗息升至九角。一切物價都被迫停留原狀。金融市塲如黃金外匯等等，亦滯在前日原價盤旋。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕大鈔發行後，各方人心振奮，對物價一致看漲。各市塲晨起均吿挺秀，惟金融當局預作準備，在各市拋售黃金證券紗布及外匯移轉證數額極夥，達六億餘元之鉅，物價乃吿回削，與前大致軋平。兩日來常局抽緊銀根已達十二億元光景，昨日市塲銀根奇緊，暗息最初見七八十元，近午又升至九十元，由於各方均感缺單，物價漲勢爲之所扼。據市塲人士觀感，日內銀根當難回鬆，物價不致大漲云。</p>
<h3>黃金短期公債今日首次抽籤</h3>
<p>基金保管會已成立</p>
<p>四日起在設交上市</p>
<p>卅八年黃金短期公債基金保管委員會，昨（一日）下午四時在國行舉行成立會。財長徐堪亦由穗飛滬參加。到委員兼政府各代表傅汝霖劉攻芸陳炳章全國商聯會朱惠淸，全國銀聯會徐國懋，全國錢聯會關能創，工業協會莊智煥等。由財部公債司司長陳炳章，任臨時主席，報吿籌備經過。繼由徐部長致詞：略稱黃金短期公債兩旬以來，售出四千餘兩，第一期債票第一次還本，已定本月二日上午十時舉行抽籤。三日由各經理銀行開始兌付本息。第一次應付本息基金，已由中央銀行分撥各經理行局備付，幷已核定自本月四日起，准於上市開拍云云。</p>
<p>詞畢，接開第一次委員會。通過（一）推選常務委員，議定由傳汝霖劉攻芸徐國懋陳炳章擔任。（二）公推主委，推定傅汝霖擔任。（三）委員會規則及辦事細則等，由常務委負共同擬定後，提下次開會時討論。該會辦公地點定爲銀行公會二樓。又悉關於第一期債票本息基金應如何保管及接收問題，該會幷決推定常委四人接收之。其總數計黃金一百零四萬八千四百兩，至第一期第一次應付本息，計黃金五萬零二百兩，決於二日由該會撥交中中交農及中信局開始償付。會議至六時一刻結束。</p>
<h3>金價起伏甚大　銀樓營業困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金市昨走勢由衰而盛。初開徘徊在十四萬九千至十五萬一關口，旋因大鈔仍未發出，而銀根緊勢仍舊，暗息一度哄高至九角，最低盤見十三萬七至十三萬九。中午以十四萬至十四萬二收盤。下午行市波譎雲瀾，起伏殊大，惟以銀根略呈鬆弛，故趨勢堅挺，最高曾至十六萬至十六萬二，終以十五萬八十六萬收盤。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀樓業公會各會員銀樓，昨起全體恢復正式營業，全體會員，分三組聯繫行市。惟以昨日金市起伏頗大，故影響掛牌價次數亦多。統計以上午每兩十五萬五千元售出及十四萬五千元收進之行市，屹立較久。全日最低盤爲十四萬六千元出，十三萬六千元進。下午金市步高，牌價亦節節上翔。最後以全日最高盤掛牌，出爲十六萬五千元，進爲十五萬三千元。昨日舊金飾掉換新金飾之耗費，每兩定爲五千元。一般銀樓，營業頗稱鼎盛，營業宗旨，多以買賣軋平爲原則。惟亦有多家以見銀根緊勢未弛，稍有賣空者。據業內某權威吿記者，以昨日金市之走勢而論，銀樓業營業頗感爲難。牌價往往無法與兎起落落之行市相呼應。故昨日上午之進出牌價，每兩相差不過一萬元，惟下午以行市波動過劇，進出價遂不得不拔開爲一萬二千元云。</p>
<h3>銀根突趨緊銷暗息喊價混亂</h3>
<p>最高百元有成交</p>
<p>昨晨本市銀根走勢，因受隔夜行局鉅額差進之影響，且市上盛傳外埠匯款被扣，且國行大拋外匯證，以致各業銀根突呈緊俏。一般日拆利息，晨起叫價，至爲混亂。最低做價，六十元有供，最高亦有以九十元與一百元做開者。至十時許，日拆利息始漸趨統一，平均在七十至八十元間。各業因聞央行大鈔出籠之訊，莫不搜求頭寸，掌握貨物，故市上缺單情形，至爲嚴重。各市塲中日拆暗息，平均在八九十元左右。其中麵粉絲綢等市塲，因缺單無供，暗息做價，高達九十元。棉紗市塲做價，先低後昂，晨起做價在七十至八十元間，至十一時後，因拆借困難，暗息亦步升至九十元左右。證交塲外貼息，開七十五元至八十元。</p>
<h3>國行決擴大組絹公開市塲委員會</h3>
<p>中央銀行爲遏止物價上漲，決盡量拋售物資，金，銀，證劵，外匯證等，並另設機構專負拋售之責。劉總裁返滬後，頻與各主管會商，及與金融界交換意見，結果已決定擴大公開市塲委員會之組織。國家行局負責人均參加，以期加强力量。頃悉：該委員會本週內卽可成立，在未成立以前，中央銀行隨時視市塲情形採取行動。</p>
<h3>中紡大量拋售布疋收進金圓近三億元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售布，共開布十五種，計售布一三七六〇疋，零頭布一五〇〇〇磅，又二四八〇〇碼，計金圓二八二，二一，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>棉紗上落狹隘</p>
<p>昨日棉紗大部醞釀，變化甚微，初開因受大鈔發行影響，執戶一致喊高，旋以銀根吿緊，且各方胃量平庸，臨收復吿鬆弛。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳晨開九十二萬元，較前高二萬元，收市低至九十萬元大關站定，與上日軋平。四〇支藍鳳終挫三萬元，三二支銀月軋小一萬元。</p>
<p>廿一支雙馬現貨一度曾破六十萬元大關，最後又回落至五十七萬元收市，廠單微昇五千元，爲五十三萬五千元。二〇支雙馬仍站住上日五十三萬元之原檔未動，其餘各檔則吿軟化，一六支變動殊鮮。</p>
<p>布市趨勢轉軟</p>
<p>布市略趨疲軟，晨初因報載發行五百元及一千元大鈔，一般心理振奮，但以業內銀根轉緊，需單者紛紛出籠，致勢不支，市價節節下游。近午聞紡建僅開售二等品細布與元嗶嘰等，欲跌之局而乃復吿回振，結果較前微見軋小。</p>
<p>龍頭細布初以二萬二千二百元開出，旋高見二萬二千五百元後，卽喊低至二萬一千三百元，午收爲二萬二千元，終降一千元。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰自二萬〇五百元至二萬〇九百元爲最高，收前曾小至二萬〇三百元，終爲二萬〇六百元，微挫四百元。四君子元直貢僅低五十元，午後塲外喊價轉昇，聞四君子元嗶嘰二萬二千五百元。</p>
<h3>本年輸日食鹽已定五十萬噸</h3>
<p>本月份可運出三萬噸</p>
<p>中日易貨貿易，食鹽部份，業已談判成功。本年度輸日食鹽，已定爲五十萬噸。二月份業已簽定合同，出四千噸。太月份可運出三萬噸。五十萬噸中，財部鹽務總局負責三十四萬噸，中信局負責十六萬噸。鹽務總局負責部份，係收取現金。中信局負責部份，則爲易貨方式。目前究係換取何市種物資，尚未具體決定。但人造絲等爲已決定者。</p>
<h3>國棉職購會決定　積極儲購原棉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國棉聯購委員會昨下午召開例會，討論要案四點：（一）該會爲扶助棉農，充實原棉存底起見，決請中央銀行於最近期內，陸續調撥足以購儲原棉十八萬担之資金，（約合二百億元之譜），以便積極購棉，委托紡建公司代紡棉紗。</p>
<p>（二）最近漢口及西安等地所存棉花，已可陸續運滬。（三）西安一帶存棉五六十萬祖，決由川陝公路順長江東下，已可大量運滬。（四）收購原棉現鈔問題，現因國行已發行大鈔，故已迎刃而解。</p>
<h3>國行掛牌收兌美鈔　每元合金圓券二千六百五十圓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕按照財金新方案規定，外國幣券仍禁止流通。中央銀行收兌外幣，應參照黃金市價及外匯移轉證價格計算。茲悉：中央銀行昨（一日）已開始掛牌，收兌美鈔，牌價定爲美鈔一元，合金圓券二千六百五十元。該項價格，袛收不出。其他各國貨幣，照比例推算。</p>
<h3>負息過重買風難振華股走勢疲軟未已</h3>
<p>昨日央行發出五百元及一千元之新金圓劵，華股市塲之反應，不但未見上漲，反普呈軟勢。各股初開，因受銀根緊　，開盤均卽平疲。惟國營股台糖續見新高峯，做二萬三千五百七十元，登第八度漲限。以後趨勢，因一路起伏不定，多空頭均不敢輕易下手，故市勢愈見下游。永紗開盤三元二角五分，一路跟隨塲外黃金起伏，最高做三元四角一分。十一時三十分，塲外黃金喊價漸低，圈內浮空又逢高加壓，散戶又咸抱觀望，行情愈盤愈低，最小曾做三元一角七分。收盤時因圈外黃金稍高，人心稍振，市趨回至三元二角二分收住。美亞初開一元三角五分，散戶因永紗市呈盤檔，大多集中美亞交易，市勢卽被拉起，高做一元五角。然終因暗息高昂，散戶不堪負擔，紛紛轉吸爲吐。十二時半，終瀉至一元三角六分收盤。小型股登漲限者，僅永業地產七十四元三角，新亞八角六分，振華一元二角一分等三種</p>
<h3>外股續見高峯</h3>
<p>塲外外股，市勢續展高昂。業中銀根雖緊，然人心仍極振作，各帮買意殷厚，其中尤以洋行帮納胃最健，故各股高峯續見，怡紗做六千三百元，六千四百元，英聯做六千七百元，怡啤做九百五十元，一千〇五十元。鋼業公司做一千四百五十元，中國紙版做一千二百元，會德豐做一萬八千元，較上日軋升一千元之譜。</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>— 看客台</p>
<p>銀樓復業笑笑搖搖</p>
<p>銀樓業全體復業了，興冲冲都想把停菜期的損失，拉回來。</p>
<p>然而，我問過幾家當局，有什麽生意好做？回答有的笑笑，有的把頭搖搖，有的一聲長歎說：「得過且過，不得過，也得過。」</p>
<p>事實擺在大家限前，儘管牌上掛着收進兌出兩價，上門交易，什九都是兌出。試問拿什麼來應市？</p>
<p>當然，開了門，電話筒裏可以敲敲；空來空去，碰碰運氣，可以堂而皇之，這就是笑笑人之所以盡在不言中。</p>
<p>其實，開門又可再做一個夢。那就是無貨應市，便可集體要求央行配供實貨。一旦夢醒之日，恐怕又是準備打烊之時了。</p>
<p>美國白銀市價，每盎司美金七角左右，所以袁頭市價，低於美鈔價七折之下時，拖進不吃虧，高出七折時，出籠總有補得進的機會。</p>
<p>譬如，昨天美鈔市價，最高到三千一百五十元，七折袁頭價爲二千一百多元。又如美鈔最低價是二千七百五十元，折袁頭價是一千九百元左右。而昨袁頭市價，最高爲二千元，最低一千八百元。如以央行掛牌價計算，倒又相近了。</p>
<p>昨央行美鈔首次掛牌二千六百五十元，但加計日拆一百元，也要二千八九百元。</p>
<p>美鈔釘住金價，本市幾都以五十元合一兩爲習慣折算率。因以此套彼，以彼套此，只要在這三角關係厮混，誰願意再幹正經事？</p>
<p>鑽進金鈔袁頭三角間有誰願意再幹正經事</p>
<p>受大鈔發行影響　食米一度堅挺　後市銀根緊俏價見回低麵粉止漲轉疲油市微挫</p>
<p>米市因大票問世，人心激昂，貨主乘機扳價，早開曾漲一千餘元，後市終以銀根緊信，暗息高昂，出戶踴躍，價乃回低。北市塲白粳一萬六千元，漲二百元，早薄稻各微挫一百元。南市塲白粳薄稻各做一萬六千元，略升二三百元。昨日南北二市塲共計到貨七二六六行石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>交易雖因大票發行，而人心甚堅，但亦因銀根奇緊。市氣疲軟，價格徘徊微挫。初開豆菜油均平定，收市豆油降二千元，生菜油略疲千元，江北老桶生油七萬二千元，後七萬元。熟菜油小車蔴油均挫二千元，豆餅猛降千元。</p>
<p>麵面</p>
<p>上漲回疲，因銀根轉緊，暗息高昂，進戶拘觀望，實銷頗呆。老車退守七千關，兵船跌落四百元，臨收低做六千六百三十元。收市後，銀根更趨緊　，拆息高達九角，執戶脫售心切，市塲一片賣出聲，市勢再小·紅蜂·孔雀·今做六千六百元，建成六千五百元，大發六千六百五十元。麩皮供求兩稀，市勢略見上漲，大包福新今做五千六百五十元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>漲跌不一，緣因銀根緊信，執戶求售頗切，黃豆普挫成餘，油廠胃口懈淡，乍豆暗挫二千元，車豆降落一成，生仁芝蔴本街胃口獨暢，且聞大票發行，人心亦堅，市勢續見挺堅。漢口白蔴猛漲近二成，臨淮關生仁再挺二千元，苞米靑帮觀望，實銷轉呆，市價各挫三五百元不等。紅糧普挫五百元，菉豆亦見下游。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局鴻章輪，昨目曼谷返滬，運來美援米九百六十三噸，計一萬包，泊中棧起卸。又海川輪，自蕪湖運食米雜糧二千一百噸，昨晨抵滬，現泊第三碼頭起卸。</p>
<h3>台糖大量到埠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局仲愷，敎仁兩輪，前昨相繼自高雄到滬。仲愷輪運來食糖二千二百噸，敎仁輪運來食糖一千八百噸，均泊金利源碼頭起卸。上項食糖均爲台灣糖業公司之貨。</p>
<h3>茶市做開不多</h3>
<p>本市茶存空虛，趨勢在喘息中，尚圖掙扎，價格方面一致高峯盤旋。據一般目光，茶葉成本勢必砌增，故前途誠有易漲難降之象，至査昨市交易，依然賣買失調，咸僅寥寥做開。</p>
<h3>絲綢盤旋</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况盤旋，漲跌甚微，初因銀根緊急，暗息高至八九十元，散戶脫手求現，市勢見軟。繼而盛傳大鈔發行在卽，各地匯款被壓，銀根緊勢卽可解除，於是　面仍多拉抬，惟以銀根緊勢有加，部份執戶了結頻繁，臨收轉入盤檔。　一二〇號有光新貨，初以低盤開做，開後聞黃金步步報跌，人心虛軟，市勢欲振乏力，喊價仍在低檔待徊，嗣又傳外埠匯款被壓，人心轉堅，多頭心理又趨活躍，喊價卽由七〇萬元邊回升至七六萬元了結。午後聞銀根稍鬆，金鈔亦見回升，人心轉好，一度高喊至八〇萬，最後以七八萬結束。　生絲昨因銀根緊急，外匯移轉證走勢平穩，圈外物價尚平，人心見虛，優級零擔晨開九二萬，九三萬，中間黃金步跌，市勢跟軟，一度低至八九萬，低後傳說大鈔發行在卽，銀根緊勢卽將解除，於是人心振奮，市價回升，近午以九一萬了結，微小萬元。　綢縀昨日市勢平穩，市上銀根承上日行局鉅額差進，各業週轉，頓見窘急，惟傳說大鈔發行，人心看好，但因開盤後，銀根愈抽愈緊，暗息由七十元昂升至九十元，散戶不堪、負，脫意較濃，市勢先平後軟。美亞初開爲五一萬，繼因圈外黃金步步低游，市勢無力支持，卽退入五十萬關，中間低檔盤旋甚久，待至臨收，缺單多已按排舒齊，生氣微轉，市勢略見轉機，終以五〇八千元午收。</p>
<h3>四礦聯營處又調整煤價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四礦聯營處煤價昨又調整，特價如次：基隆煤五六六〇〇元，白煤納子五五〇〇〇元，白煤塊八三〇〇〇元，白煤屑五萬元，外國烟煤無貨無市。</p>
<h3>濼煤陸貫南來　供應可望好轉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據烟煤調配處某負責人語記者，二月份各地到煤情形，尚勉可敷衍。計到開灤煤一一七〇〇噸，蘇聯煤一五七六〇噸，合煤五二七一三噸。以上共計八〇一七三噸。而事實上本市月需九萬噸，而南京區亦賴本市供應，月需三萬噸，短缺之數，猶待彌補。惟目本月份起，以樂煤已可陸續南來，預計月可到六萬噸，再加上台煤，供應情形可望好轉。現四礦聯營處已與本市輪船業公會洽租輪船十艘，俾輪流運輸濼煤南下。其中大上海及唐山兩輪業已開始運輪。尚餘粤東，海天，華新，南强，永興，天平，福祥，台安等八輪，亦可陸續開航云。</p>
<h3>俄煤到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕俄煤昨有到滬，茂泰公司代理之俄輪巴洛諾號，由海參崴運來煤斤八千餘噸，昨日下午三時許抵埠，現泊董家渡中棧碼頭起卸。</p>
<h3>桐油先堅後回</h3>
<p>桐油昨市，晨開卽以俏利姿態出現，行情一致勁跳，綠因自指數猛砌後，八大公用事業亦在醞釀漲價中。同時更聞漢口各地，桐油來源已吿窒息，目前僅恃溫州蘭谿少數供應，故人心進展，喊價漫無止境，惟迄午後受銀根報緊，圈外物資下赴之刺激，遂亦不支，驟轉軟化，而與隔日相較，則乏榮辱。</p>

<h3>慶馬華·羽毛球·稱霸全球</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕這是中國體育史上光榮的一頁，馬來亞華僑隊獲得了世界羽毛球錦標賽湯姆斯杯的冠軍，從蘇格蘭把這世界冠軍的銀杯捧回來，要保持到一九五二年，再與世界各强角逐。中國體育在世界競賽上是什麽都輪不到，這幾位馬華僑胞居然把世界錦標奪了來，是何等光榮的事。</p>
<p>羽球運動，老少男女咸宜，四季皆可，網球家可作爲寒季室內的活動。羽球尤風行南洋各地，華僑嗜之如狂，人材鼎盛。馬來健將早有世界水準，名震全球，這次榮登世界首座，早是意料中之事。記得七屆全運去年五月在上海舉行時，馬華代表團曾帶來了三位羽球健將，也就是這次得湯姆斯杯的功臣。這三位是：黃德福，黃炳順，楊廣才。僑胞是預備請他們來，把絕技表演給國人看，來提高國內羽球的水準，惜乎那時大家都忙着全運會中其他的節目，沒有充份注意到這三位世界健將，各報的宣傳也不够，讓他們靜悄悄在體育館內表演後溜去了。那時表演的精彩，造就的高超，眞吧爲觀止，殺得上海幾位代表洪德全，侯樹基，李國璠等片甲不歸，招架都不得。</p>
<p>湯姆斯杯是英國上屆羽球冠軍湯姆斯爵士贈杯發起，每四年舉行一次，全世界各國參加的，分區比賽，和台維斯杯同一制度，共寶五單打四雙打，九賽五勝者勝。馬華隊參加比賽以來，一路打盡敵手，各國望風拜倒，最後與美國複賽，在格拉斯哥舉行，觀衆三千餘人，湯姆斯爵士親自到塲主持，門票在幾個星期前都預售完了，盛况空前，結果，馬華以六比三打倒美國，獲得與丹麥決賽權。其中美國主將費禮門。也是世界羽球單打冠軍連勝了黃德福與黃炳順，激戰最烈。費禮門十年來從未失敗一盤，這回全馬華冠軍黃德福居然勝他一盤，難能可貴。廿六日，馬華在蘭開夏與丹麥決冠軍，又以八比一大勝，痛擊荷軍，使全球側目。賽前因爲第二單打黃炳順手臂受傷，不能出塲，荷軍小覷馬華，居然宣言允許任何人替代，以示寬大。但馬華隊仍由第三單打羅德福起代，竟然將荷蘭第一名選手史加洛普打倒，實爲一大收穫。荷軍幾至全軍覆沒。</p>
<p>馬華隊在海外替祖國爭榮，我們在這裏遙遠祝賀他們的勝利。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽第二循環　仁餘再克麥令　數度平手相差三球表演精美賽情緊張</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽甲一組第二循環昨晚開始，仁餘再遇麥令斯，四十分鐘劇戰，難解難分，仁餘卒以五十二比四十六再勝麥令。上半時廿五比廿一仁餘多四分。雙方均表演極淸晰美觀之籃球技術，仁餘射籃，昨晚尤爲順手，隨手揮來，皆能妙中。吳新運徐仲已孫國政三劍客出人頭地，得分最多。麥令人材衆多，按術平均，身材高大，其高球傳送得分甚多，仁餘能在此種環境下，以低球克服難關，洵屬不易。麥令一次進步一次，雖敗打來却甚可觀。甲二組兩塲：（一）回力B大勝華南，六十三比三十五，上半時廿四比廿二。（二）西靑籃勝暴風雨，卅二比三十分，上半時十八比十三。</p>
<p>上半時二十分鐘之局勢，前十分鐘麥令以一二分二三分領前，再成各十二之平手，比賽極度緊張，迨第二個十分鐘麥令以正式陣容上塲，依舊難分彼此，又見各十六·十九·共計六次之平手。仁餘開始穿出，上半時廿五比廿一佔先。大戰開始時，仁餘以姚文彝。沈鵬舉。蔡金典。李肇和·徐仲已上塲，麥令勃拉曼開紀錄，仁餘仲已金典報以三分，古地華而夫增添二球，蔡徐打成各六平手。朋克期東又顯顏色，八比六麥隊又領前。肇和鵬一罰一擲，九比八後來居上。仲已罰中，歐納斯造成十平，仁餘傳遞精彩，繼又十二平。麥令斯開始以正式好手上塲，萊姆賽·利斯·哥芬斯·茀勞特·喬克生魚貫而入，仁餘尚能紮住陣脚。俄成十六平手，萊姆山利斯方中籃，孫國政拉十九平（此時已六度平手）。國政籃下見功夫，新運依樣葫蘆，仁餘諸將紛紛建功，始能透氣，上半時仁餘廿五比廿一領前四分。</p>
<p>下半時上塲麥令來勢汹汹，連連中的，頓時打成各廿七之平手，分數此上彼落，極度緊張，幸新運國政投籃連中，仁餘又見抬頭，麥令力追，比數爲卅八比卅六，四十二比四十，僅落後二分。此時雙方求勝心切，麥令一味進攻，後防大爲鬆弛，漏洞大開，仁餘之球紛紛進網。麥令大勢已去，無法挽回，最後比數爲五十二比四十六，仁餘再度克麥令</p>

<h3>「氣囊」陳震南應邀赴菲賽泳　今啓程參加四百千五兩項目</h3>
<p>〔本報香港一日電〕水國英雄陳震南日前接得菲律賓游泳界來函，邀請赴菲比賽，除陳震南外被邀請者尚有梁愛梅，S晏打臣，H晏打臣，但以上三人因事未能應約，只得陳震南一人於二日啓程。香港華人游泳界特於廿八日晚爲之大排盛宴，預祝成功。</p>
<p>〔香港廿八日航訊〕「勵進泳團之寶」，號稱「氣囊」的長距離游泳名將陳震南，這次被菲體育總會看中，特別邀他往參加下月五日六日舉行的全菲公開泳賽。這是公開國際性的，無論何國何地的水怪，均可報名參加，一顯身手；袛是各運動員們參加所耗的旅費，照規定是各人本身自已負責的。但，陳震南却例外，一切膳宿來回機票，全由菲方負責開消。</p>
<p>日本本來是遠東的「游泳王國」成績可媲尖美國一流好手；但這次菲島的比賽，由於和約的未簽訂，日本在國際體壇的資格仍未恢復，菲方也沒有邀約他們來參加，雖然日本的靑年古橋曾經迭次打破四百和千五公尺世界的紀錄。</p>
<p>據說世界游泳協會的主幹份子美人金巴秘書長，已設法替日本游泳界恢復國際賽的資格，並打算請古橋赴美表演；然而這祇是金巴個人的一個計劃，仍得要他的奔走疏通，目前言之尚嫌過乎，但，這個世界游泳協會的秘書，却很有自信的對澳洲的西報記者說：「在來屆世運前，日本定可恢復國際體育競技的資格」。</p>
<p>且說震南和他的敎練黃少雄，前幾天的午後，應約到域多利會，和該會秘書商量出發赴菲事，肥南對他說：「在嚴寒的冬天，雖然仍經常的習泳，但池水太冷，自然不及游泳季時的這末好成績；而且，此番袛得他個人遠渡重洋，參與大賽，而且敎練也未克隨行，誠恐名落孫山，有失港菲華僑的面子」。他對這次的赴非競技，絕對沒有什麼勝利的自信，而表示着躊躇的樣子。</p>
<p>經過那位域多利秘書和黃敎練的勸勉，震南終於在赴菲的合約上，正式的簽名，並決定下月二日乘汎美機出發，五日六日出賽，項目也已確知爲四百及一千五百兩項。賽完後，預定八日乘汎美機返港。關於赴菲的入境照種種手續，是相當麻煩的。據域多利會中人說：這件事他們已聽得上海銀行大班摩士設法替陳帮忙了。</p>
<p>比賽無疑的將在菲國立黎剎的游泳塲館舉行。這是個五十公尺長的白瓷泳池，和域多利與中青的長短有別，因爲在香港所有的泳賽是根據英泳協會所訂定以「碼制」爲標準的，但在菲律濱的所有泳賽，則係根據美國人主持下的世運游泳則例，而以「公尺制度」爲標準，公尺自較碼制爲長，就是一千五百公尺也要比一千穴百碼爲多，陳震南是被稱爲「氣袋」的。</p>
<p>肥仔陳震南</p>
<h3>菲選手馬巴爲肥南勁敵</h3>
<p>上次港菲埠際游泳競賽，肥南與菲選手馬巴決鬥八百八十碼時，陳雖以一掌之微，不幸屈居亞軍，但他後勁的游刃有餘底實力，是衆所驚異的。所以這次赴菲，我們對于陳的四百公尺，雖然沒有甚麼奢望，如果能題名位置，便如願以足；但在一千五百公尺運項　，我舞認爲他是可以戰勝那位菲島「長途泳之王」的馬巴氏，而一　在港八百八十僅敗敗之恥的。一</p>
<p>不過菲律賓是四季常春的海島，那裏的天氣，似乎要比香港爲更適合於訓練水上運動的。馬巴在近幾個月來，或者已有了長足的進步。然而誠如黃少雄兄所說：「震南的一千五百公尺，如能保持廿一分二十二秒二的最佳紀錄，他是大可以榮膺這一次國際賽的冠軍，而揚威異域，爲港僑爭光的。</p>
<p>査「肥仔南」身重一百八十磅，蟬聯三屆渡海冠軍，去年度曾獲全港公開賽之二百二十，四百四十，八百八十三項冠軍錦標，港菲埠際賽時曾建下不少汗馬功勞。</p>
<h3>裝甲兵籃球賽今日決奪錦標</h3>
<p>陸軍裝甲兵司令部舉辦之籃球錦標賽經多日角逐，已臨最後階段，昨賽兩塲裝甲兵學校以四五比十八大勝獨戰二營，戰一團以廿七對廿五，一球之差力挫戰二團，同獲決賽權，將於今日下午二時起決奪錦標。</p>
<h3>中華工商專校　易長糾紛解決　四日開始上課</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市中華工商專科學校易長糾紛，連日因沈嗣莊校長與校董會楊衛玉各在報端刋佈啓事，引起各方之注意，而敎授與學生亦有被捲入漩渦情形，一部份學生至中華職敎社繳費註册，另有一部份學生則仍向原校繳費註册，學校有分裂爲二趨勢。該校校董不忍手創之學校陷此境地，乃居間調解，昨日下午校董會在中華職敎社開會，會商達三小時以上，該一糾紛日內卽可獲得解決。</p>
<p>現決定學生自四日（星期五）起全部在永嘉路蓉園原址開始上課。校董會所推之校董兼代校長顧樹森將於今日赴校與沈嗣莊校長洽商一切。</p>
<h3>馬華繼續參加全英羽球賽　咸信五項錦標中祗少可得其二</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廣播：據此間羽毛球界人士觀察：認本年度之全英羽毛球賽，將因最近以長勝軍姿態攫得湯姆斯盃之馬來亞華僑之參加而發生重大變化。咸信五項錦標中，至少將有兩項，爲馬華奪得。按全英羽毛球賽之重要性，可與網球之溫布爾頓年賽比擬，今年比賽，將在哈靈蓋舉行。</p>
<p>馬來亞女將，尚未正式露面，故實力無從揣測。但此間羽球觀察家認爲：倘馬華女子技術水準與男子成正比例，則混合雙打中，其他各地球員，俱將難逃敗辱。</p>
<p>男子單打方面，「星期快報」推黃炳順（秉璇）爲最傑出之球員。</p>
<p>馬來之各雙打組，根據渠等在國際賽中痛擊美國與丹麥諸隊之演出，冠軍頭銜，迨已如彼等囊中之物。</p>
<p>今年大賽，參加者空前衆多，達一百七十六人。美國·丹麥·印度·南非·瑞典諸國好手，均全部參加。</p>
<h3>建議全國運動會羽球應列爲錦標</h3>
<p>馬華羽毛球隊，這次在海外以優異卓越的表演，榮膺了第一屆湯姆斯盃，雖然他們此番代表的是英屬馬來亞，然而他們全隊從領隊到預備員，無一不是中華選手。這該是我國體育界前所未有的榮譽。</p>
<p>路透社體育編者摩根，在他的一篇電文裏說：「沒有一個人會否認，馬來亞是這羽毛球界值得稱讚的世界霸主，這也予贈送此盃者的湯姆斯爵士，某種程度的安慰。</p>
<p>馬華隊從遠途而來，化費了許多金錢，然而他們終於成功了，建樹着無可推翻的榮譽——他們是整個宇宙間最佳的羽毛球員。</p>
<p>馬華隊不但在球藝上有驚人的演出，其在塲上所表演的體育精神，和在堪外的禮貌，都可作爲模範。凡捐款給他們的應該自認爲滿意——他們的錢並沒有白化。</p>
<p>馬來亞的華僑們應該爲這一班羽毛球大使們而驕傲，他們的格言是：「我們要贏，但要贏得够體育家風度，倘若我們輸了，我們也要輸得漂亮，最低限度我們盡了我們的本領和力量。」</p>
<p>記得在全運會期間，這幾位馬華的彗星在體育館中表演的時候，上海第一流的羽毛球家李國璠比喻得好：「他（指黃炳順）在塲上踱方步，而對方則在那裏拚命奔跑呢！」</p>
<p>羽毛球不是中國人所發明，但是第一屆湯姆斯盃賽却落在中國人手裏，這不僅是中國人的榮譽，却由此體會得這是中國人有打羽毛球的天賦。吾人建議全國運動會中應該正式列入羽毛球一項，不該再爲表演賽了。</p>
<p>好在羽毛球設備麗單，費用便宜，爲國人一般經濟力量所能負担。——願從今以後，天下羽毛球錦標，盡來歸我。（艾戀）</p>

<h3>National Affairs Conference Held in Beijing Reaching Conclusions on Unity and Reform; Major Peace Talks Being Studied in Detail</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] In order to discuss major peace talks, promote unity, and comprehensively reform politics, Acting President Li invited important consultations. As central dignitaries and local officials had gathered in the capital one after another, the consultations officially began at 4:00 PM on the 1st at the Fu Hou Gang official residence. Those invited to participate included Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, Ju Zheng, Shao Lizi, He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Wu Zhongxin, Bai Chongxi, and more than 20 important ministers and heads of departments. Zhang Qun also rushed to participate immediately after disembarking from his plane. During the meeting, Acting President Li explained the government's sincerity and determination for peace talks, and emphasized the necessity of internal unity and political reform. The participating dignitaries also put forward their opinions on the current overall situation and various issues, and discussed them in detail. Acting President Li also hosted a dinner for the participating dignitaries at the official residence, which ended at 9:00 PM. In recent days, Acting President Li has held individual talks with various dignitaries, and has reached some conclusions on peace talks, internal unity, and political reform. The meeting on the afternoon of the 1st made these opinions more concrete. It is said that this series of talks may continue for two or three more sessions. After Cheng Qian arrives in Beijing on the 2nd, he will also participate in the discussions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] After participating in the consultations at Acting President Li's official residence on the 1st, President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian paid another visit to Acting President Li at around 9:30 PM, and left after talking for a quarter of an hour. In addition, Chairman of the National Resources Commission Sun Yueqi also paid a visit to Acting President Li on the evening of the 1st to report on matters.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Well-informed sources say that the Communist side is delaying the appointment of representatives because some details are still being processed. Once everything is in place, formal negotiations can begin in Beiping. It is estimated that positive steps can be taken within a month. It is also learned that the Shanghai Peace Delegation has reached the following agreement in principle: (1) Negotiations will be held in Beiping; (2) Each side, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, will send four representatives; (3) If there is a desire to increase the number of representatives, both sides should increase equally. It is not yet known whether Acting President Li will retain the current four "official representatives," but it seems certain that Shao Lizi will serve as the head of the delegation, with Zhang Zhizhong, Huang Shaohong, and Zhong Tianxin as the other three. It is heard that the Communist side is willing to consider the "three-thirds" plan, in which the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and non-partisan leaders participate in the new government with an equal number of representatives. However, it is currently unknown whether the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee led by Li Jishen will be included in the Kuomintang quota.</p>
<p>It is Widely Rumored that the CCP Has Appointed Four Peace Talk Representatives</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] It is widely rumored here that the CCP has already appointed Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, and Lin Biao as peace talk representatives.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Regarding the prospects for peace talks, according to a certain person involved: From the conditions brought back by the Shanghai Peace Delegation, it can be seen that the CCP does not overemphasize the punishment of war criminals; on the contrary, they are unwilling to relax on the issue of military reorganization. In the military reorganization plan of the Political Consultative Conference three years ago, the ratio of military strength between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was stipulated as five to one. Although it may not be completely reversed today, the CCP demands to occupy the majority of the military strength.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Those close to the Shanghai Peace Delegation say (10) that the Communist side no longer insists on punishing war criminals as a condition for resuming peace talks, and is also willing to make some concessions on the reorganization of the army. It is also learned that there is a tendency among the CCP leaders to "pardon" some of the important officials on the list of war criminals, but they insist that Song, Kong, Chen, Jiang, and the so-called "Four Big Families" must be punished. At the same time, well-informed sources here say that President Chiang's confidants are currently trying to persuade him to travel abroad in order to eliminate the barriers to peace or to resume power and personally make peace, but all have been coldly received by Chiang. Chen Yi, the former chairman of Zhejiang Province, was therefore detained in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] It is reported that the records of the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations during Marshall's mission to China in 1946 have been found and are being carefully studied to find a way to make them acceptable now. It is reported that all points on which the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached a partial or full agreement during Marshall's mission to China are being listed. At the same time, the major issues on which they most disagreed and which ultimately led to Marshall's failure are also being listed in the same way, so as to avoid obstacles in future talks. These reports have not been officially confirmed.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Will Undergo Partial Restructuring; Rumors of Sun Ke's Resignation Are a Thing of the Past; Personnel Changes or Replacements Will Be Made to the Heads of Various Departments and Commissions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] According to a senior government official, a partial restructuring of the Executive Yuan is inevitable. Premier Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Guangzhou to participate in the important consultations convened by Acting President Li to discuss the current situation. In addition to this, the issue of the partial restructuring of the Executive Yuan was also the main topic that Sun raised to Acting President Li. If a decision can be made on this matter in Beijing, it will still follow past practice, and will be announced after being approved by the Central Political Committee. However, the date of the announcement may not be within this week. It is said that the rumors of Sun Ke's resignation are a thing of the past. Acting President Li has painstakingly promoted unity within the government and has made every effort to communicate with various committee members. He has achieved considerable success in reaching a consensus on the current problems. Sun Ke's continued chairmanship of the Executive Yuan is one example of this. As for the Legislative Yuan's dissatisfaction with Sun Ke, due to Wu Tiecheng and Sun Ke's successive returns north and their several individual consultations, the situation is not as serious as rumored. Because Secretary-General Duanmu Kai is still in Guangzhou, the two men's policy directions may not be reported to the Legislative Yuan this week, but must be postponed to next week. The reason for the partial restructuring of the Executive Yuan is also related to the fact that all parties are dissatisfied with the top leaders of the Executive Yuan. In addition, there are heads of departments and commissions who have expressed their firm intention to resign, such as Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Communications Yu Dawei, and Acting Minister of Education Chen Xubing and Minister of Judicial Administration Zhao Chen, who are represented by vice-ministers, it is necessary to nominate successors or replace them. The senior official believes that when a partial restructuring is implemented, there may be more changes. Among the current heads of the Executive Yuan who are in the capital, in addition to Premier Sun Ke, there are Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng, Minister of the Interior Hong Lanyou (returning from Shanghai), Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi, Minister of Finance Xu Kan (having gone to Shanghai from Guangzhou), Minister of Land Administration Wu Shangying, Minister of Water Conservancy Zhong Tianxin, Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang, Minister of Education Chen Xubing, Minister of Food Guan Jiwang, Minister of Resources Sun Yueqi, etc. In Guangzhou, Secretary-General Duanmu Kai is in charge, but Duanmu Kai will also come to Beijing for a trip in the short term. The regular meeting of the Executive Yuan scheduled for the 2nd will be suspended once because the Premier and Vice Premier are not in Guangzhou. As for the rumors that the Political Affairs Conference will be moved to Beijing, the reporter inquired with relevant parties and it seems that there is no such decision yet. Whether this will be necessary in the future depends on how the situation develops.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Amid frequent peace discussions, general attention in Beijing remains focused on whether Executive Yuan Premier Sun Ke will resign, obey public opinion and move the Executive Yuan back to Nanjing, and whether the legislators will still insist on opposing Sun. Someone close to Sun said that Premier Sun originally planned to stay in Nanjing for a week, but he may now change his original plan. In recent days, Wu Tiecheng has been entertaining influential legislators almost every day, apparently with the aim of speaking up for Sun Ke. However, according to a survey on the 1st, many legislators still insist on putting forward a vote of no confidence in the government.</p>
<h3>National Army Around Tianjin and Beiping Has Been Reorganized by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the CCP radio station in Beiping, the National Army around Tianjin and Beiping ended its original command system on February 21 and was officially under the command of the People's Liberation Army's Tianjin and Beiping Front Command. The transfer procedures were handled by Guo Zongfen on behalf of Fu Zuoyi. Officers of the National Army at the division level and above were summoned to attend this meeting. The Communist Army's reorganization plan stipulates: (1) The three-level command organizations of the Fourth and Ninth Army Corps and eight army headquarters originally under the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters will be terminated, and officers will be incorporated into the Communist Army's Tianjin and Beiping Front Command, various army corps headquarters, and various army headquarters. The 25 divisions under their command will be reorganized into independent divisions of the People's Liberation Army, and various special forces will be merged with the Communist Army's special forces. (2) National Army political workers can be employed after training. (3) Those assigned to work in the Communist Army and their families will enjoy the same treatment as the Communist Army. (4) National Army officers who are willing to study further will be organized into classes according to their work positions and levels. (5) National Army officers who wish to return to their hometowns will be paid three months' salary and train tickets according to their original salary, and will be allowed to take private property, family members, and one or two escort soldiers with them; officers residing in the Communist area can be divided into a share of land to which they are entitled after returning to their hometowns, and will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of their Land Law Outline, but they must abide by the laws and decrees of the democratic government in the future. As for their past behavior towards farmers, no further investigation will be made. In addition, a "Certificate of Participation in the Peaceful Liberation of Beiping" will be issued uniformly to prove this.</p>
<h3>The Cruiser "Chongqing" Sailed from the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River to Yantai</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] China's largest warship, the cruiser "Chongqing," sailed from its defensive position in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to Yantai, a port controlled by the Chinese Communists in Shandong, a few days ago. This has now been confirmed by reliable Chinese sources here. The departure from the defense line was apparently due to someone forging orders. According to the Navy Headquarters here, they were unaware of the ship's escape. Gui Yongqing is now investigating in Shanghai, and no details can be released.</p>
<h3>Military Pay is Paid in Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Soldiers Receive Two Dollars and Fifty Cents; Generals Receive Twelve Dollars</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Starting this month, military pay will be paid in silver dollars. Pay grades range from two dollars and fifty cents to twelve dollars, with soldiers receiving two dollars and fifty cents per month and generals receiving twelve dollars per month.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Arrives in the Capital from Chongqing; Says There is No Truth to the Transfer of Hu Zongnan's Troops to Sichuan; Local Economic Reform Plan is Being Discussed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Zhang Qun, the Chongqing Pacification Director, along with Deputy Director and Chief of Staff Xiao Yisu and his party, arrived in Beijing on a special "Chasing Clouds" plane via Weiyang in the fading light. Because many government officials had already participated in the important meeting convened by Acting President Li at 4:00 PM, only a dozen or so people, including Bai Chongxi, were at the scene to welcome them. Zhang's plane took off from Chongqing at 9:30 AM on the 1st and landed at Jiyang at around 2:00 PM, waiting to pick up Xiang Chairman Cheng Qian, who was going to Hengyang from Changsha, on the same plane to Beijing. Because Cheng was unable to arrive on time, they continued to fly to Beijing at 3:15 PM and arrived at 6:00 PM. At the airport, Zhang said that the southwestern provinces and Sichuan are now very stable. The rumor that Hu Zongnan's troops have been transferred to Sichuan is completely false. Liu Wenhui's transfer to Chengdu has been stated by himself and does not have the serious meaning that is rumored. As for the saying that the chairman of Sichuan is about to be changed, it is even more untrue. He has only been the Chongqing Pacification Director for ten days. The Southwest Military and Political Conference convened a few days ago was only to review the military and political situation in the Southwest and to plan how to reform the Southwest's politics and economy in the future. However, having only been in office for less than ten days, everything is still up in the air. He was summoned to come this time to consult with the Central Government, and there is no question of reporting on his work. When asked by reporters whether he had brought any new economic plans, Zhang said that they were still under discussion. The Chongqing Pacification Headquarters intends to imitate Central China and establish a political affairs committee to guide the political affairs of its jurisdiction. Zhang also said that the southwestern provinces have not considered issuing local currency. The Central Government's financial reform plan has now been announced, and he hopes that it will have good results after implementation and balance local financial revenues and expenditures. When talking about the peace issue, Zhang emphasized that the southwestern provinces obey the Central Government on both peace and war. When asked by reporters whether there was any hope for peace, Zhang said: "Peace is needed by the people and us. Everyone wants peace, so there is hope for peace." When asked again how peace could be realized, Zhang particularly pointed out: "We must make comprehensive efforts. If only partial efforts are made, or if I work hard and you don't, then peace is still difficult to achieve." Zhang stayed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dormitory. Zhang Zhizhong and Bai Chongxi visited and talked for a long time at 9:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 1st] Zhang Qun will stay in Beijing for two weeks on this trip.</p>
<h3>Cheng Qian Will Fly to Beijing Today</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch on the 1st] The special plane to welcome Cheng Qian landed in Hengyang on the afternoon of the 1st. Cheng took the Yuehan train to Hengyang at 12:00 PM and can take off on the morning of the 2nd. Tang Honglie, Yang Jirong, Liu Yuanrou, and others accompanied him.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Ta Kung Pao Suspended and Changed to Progressive Daily</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the CCP broadcast, the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao has been changed to the "Progressive Daily" by the newspaper's colleagues. After registering with the Tianjin Military Control Committee, it was first published on February 27. The radio station broadcast stated that the newspaper "was a mouthpiece for warlords, bureaucrats, and comprador control groups during the Beiyang warlord era, and after Chiang Kai-shek came to power, it became an organ of the Kuomintang political science system. Over the years, the basic position expressed by Ta Kung Pao has been anti-people and anti-democratic." Therefore, the newspaper's colleagues "recognized the reactionary association of Ta Kung Pao" and decided to suspend publication and "abandon this bad name and use a new name." Note: Ta Kung Pao is one of the oldest major newspapers in China. It was first published in Tianjin and has been published for more than 30 years. At present, in addition to the Shanghai version, the newspaper also publishes the Chongqing version and the overseas Hong Kong version domestically. It is said that the host of the Tianjin Progressive Daily is Yang Gang, a former female employee of Ta Kung Pao. The radio station also said that the Tianjin Xin Sheng Bao, Bo Min Bao, and Han Ying Bao have been granted permission by the city's Military Control Committee to temporarily publish. The Bo Min Bao has been republished since the 12th, and the Xin Sheng Bao and Han Ying Bao were recently published.</p>
<h3>Zhang Fakui Goes to Shaoguan to Take Office</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 1st] The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army Zhang Fakui went to Shaoguan on the 1st to take office. Yu Hanmou, the director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, went with him to handle the handover, and returned to Guangzhou after the matter was completed.</p>
<h3>Presidents of Twelve Universities in Shanghai and Hangzhou Arrive in Beijing to Petition; Request that All Expenses Be Paid According to the Index; Acting President Li Personally Receives Them and Listens to Their Reports</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Wang Zhizhuo, Zhang Yi, Li Shouyong, and other presidents of twelve universities in Shanghai, including Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, Tongji, and Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 28th to petition. Acting President Li received them at the official residence at 11:30 AM at noon and listened to the reports on the situation of each school. Wang and others put forward two main points: (1) Please pay all school expenses according to the index. (2) Please allocate emergency funds as soon as possible. Acting President Li expressed his agreement to this and promised to hand it over to the Executive Yuan for handling. In the evening, Wang and others also discussed with Acting Minister of Education Chen Xubing and put forward nine requests: (1) The salaries of teachers and staff in each school will be paid in full from February according to the original amount, multiplied by the local cost of living index for employees.

<h3>Cases Discussed in This Legislative Yuan Session: More Political Than Legal; Procedural Committee Suggests Holding Plenary Talks to Exchange Views on Reform and Peace Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] It is possible that no legal cases will be proposed for discussion during the second meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan on the 4th. The Legislative Yuan's Procedural Committee held its second meeting on the 1st, and no final decision has been made on this matter. However, there are currently two important issues that must be resolved first. One is the handling of various cases. In the past, after reporting to the Yuan's plenary session, they were assigned to relevant committees for review, draft review reports, and then submitted to the Yuan's plenary session for a decision. The Yuan has twenty-one committees, requiring a large number of staff. To simplify matters, the Procedural Committee has drafted five measures on the 1st to implement classified and combined offices. Each committee will be established as usual, but its staff will be divided into political, economic, military, cultural, and social groups, according to their respective natures, and will work together. The other is that this Yuan session is more political than legal. The members are brewing discussions on important issues related to the current situation. General ordinary legal cases have therefore lost importance, and important issues related to the current situation cannot be handled in the general manner of cases. Therefore, the Procedural Committee decided to suggest holding a plenary talk for all members to exchange views on political reform plans and issues related to peace negotiations, and then decide on concrete measures. The Procedural Committee will submit the above two matters to the Yuan's plenary session for a decision on the 4th.</p>

According to the Legislative Yuan Office, Secretary-General Zhen Guwen of the Legislative Yuan recently sent a telegram to Deputy Secretary-General Yan Guofu here, instructing him to continue handling the resumption of the meeting in Guangzhou to meet the needs of the current situation.</p>

I hope that my colleagues will be aware of the difficulties of the times, make calm decisions on tactics and interests, save the critical situation late, not be petty on small matters, or be anxious about emotions, lest we suffer the criticism of the Song people who could not make a decision and the enemy had already crossed the river."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Freedom and Equality Are Equally Needed!</h3>
<p>—The Main Principles of People's Peace—</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Huiqing's Shanghai Peace Delegation returned to Shanghai this morning. The people of Shanghai will surely express their sincere condolences and place deep expectations on them. The peace we, the people, desire is people's peace, and the main principles of which should be: freedom and equality are equally needed.</p>
<p>The reason why we, the people, want peace is, of course, for survival. However, survival must have meaning. The meaning of survival lies in freedom and equality, neither of which is dispensable. Recently, I often hear people say: "There is freedom but no equality in the government's jurisdiction, and there is equality but no freedom in the CCP's area." In fact, these observations are just general superficial talks. It is difficult to say exactly what boundaries the so-called "have" and the so-called "have not" have reached. However, even from this relief-like critique, it can be seen that ordinary people really feel that freedom and equality are equally needed. However, they feel that freedom and equality are like fish and bear's paws, and they want to have both. Therefore, they seem to be somewhat dissatisfied with the real life in these two regions. Because of this, they hope for a peaceful political environment so that everyone can have freedom and equality.</p>
<p>In today's China, in China where the war has not yet ended, to be honest, no matter where, freedom and equality may not be fully enjoyed by the people. This is not an extravagant demand on our part. Before peace is fully realized, this is inevitable. Even in the world where the two major groups are still engaged in the Cold War, it is probably still wishful thinking for all of humanity to enjoy freedom and equality.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about other countries for the time being, let's just take a look at our own real situation.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about equality: In the government's jurisdiction, the Principle of People's Livelihood has not yet been seriously implemented. In the past, it may have been intentionally or unintentionally moving in the opposite direction, so that in the past ten years, the rich have become richer, the poor have become poorer, and the middle class has been almost completely destroyed. This is of course an unequal social pathology of economic life; the criticism of the three words "no equality" cannot but be said to be pertinent. In theory, in the CCP's area, regardless of whether they are practicing communism or New Democracy, it should be as advertised, with true equality. We don't need to list the refugees who were forced to flee from the CCP area because of liquidation struggles, how they lived an unequal life at that time, suffering to the extreme, and even leaving their hometowns, crying for hunger and cold. Even in the bits and pieces of news recently transmitted from Peiping, we can seem to glimpse some not-so-equal scenes. The luxury of the Six Nations Hotel, the grand banquet of sixty tables at Dongxinglou, is as described by a certain newspaper, "When the wine is drunk and the ears are hot, they forget the endless flames of war!" After the cheers and drinking, I wonder if there are still compatriots on the streets and in the fields who cannot get millet bran? If we compare this with the result of some workers in Tianjin demanding higher wages and shorter working hours, but instead getting an 80% wage cut and two more working hours, where is the equality?</p>
<p>It is almost universally known that there is no freedom in the CCP area. Although some people want to support the scene in various ways, saying how free and comfortable it is there, they can't hide the facts after all. There is no need to cite hearsay. Just look at the fact that American reporters are generally prohibited from interviewing and sending telegrams, and Mr. Cheng Shewo's World Daily and World Evening News have been sealed up (not to mention Yishibao and other newspapers). Even Tianjin's Ta Kung Pao is being subjected to the title of "reactionary newspaper" and forced to change to "progressive newspaper." It should be known that terms such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press are absolutely unusable in the CCP area. As for other freedoms, such as freedom of residence, freedom of belief, freedom of communication, etc., whether there is no interference can be proved by facts. In the government's jurisdiction, although there are still people shouting to fight for freedom, at least in terms of freedom of speech, it is much freer than in the CCP area. However, before the state of war has ended and peace has not been truly realized, due to the facts, there are indeed many laws and actions that restrict people's freedom. The inability to stop the implementation of martial law, the continued arrest of military spies, and the prohibition of the publication of unregistered newspapers and periodicals, etc., we cannot but admit that the people are not completely free.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that when peace talks begin, both parties should pay more attention to the wishes of the people. Instead of focusing on arguing about how to distribute territory and political power, it is better to pay attention to how to determine policies so that the people can enjoy full freedom and true equality.</p>

The Communist Army and the Independent Regiment, which were originally on that line, have withdrawn to Daijiazhuang and Loufengzhuang. In addition, the 101st, 102nd, and 103rd Regiments of the Changjiang Column of the Communist Army, which had previously scurried to the Kou'an National Army bridgehead, were transferred to Jingjiang Huangqiao on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 1st] Military news: In northern Jiangsu, the Communist troops are not only stepping up shipbuilding, but also actively controlling civilian ships. It is reported that in Jiangyan alone, more than 1,000 civilian ships are being used as standbys. In addition, more than 300 civilian ships in the Hewen area northwest of Kou'an have been requisitioned by the Communist Army.</p>
<p>[Our Pukou Dispatch, 1st] The Communist troops continued to mobilize incessantly in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the surrounding areas of Quanjiao, Lai'an, Tianchang, and Liuhe yesterday and today. On the night of the 28th, various units of the local Communist Jianghuai Independent Brigade and the Southeast Detachment of the 1st Military Sub-district, each divided into several small groups of 200 to 500 people, continued to scurry towards the forward positions of the National Army in Xige, Wenshanji, and Getangji. Guandimiao and other places all withdrew after being counterattacked by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 1st] After the National Army detected signs of a large-scale southward movement of Communist troops in northern Jiangsu, the military authorities in Zhenjiang ordered a special curfew today. The Communist troops were very busy mobilizing between Liuhe and Kou'an north of the Yangtze River, and 2,000 Communist troops were moving south in Yizheng.

<h3>Opening of the Taiwan Administrative Meeting; Chen Cheng Delivers a Speech Explaining the Principles of Provincial Governance; Training the People to Exercise the Four Powers Decided in Five Steps</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 1st] The opening ceremony of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Meeting and the Provincial Government's monthly meeting for March were held in the Zhongshan Hall at 9:00 AM this morning. More than 4,000 people participated. Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng attended in military uniform and said in his speech: Since Taiwan's restoration, although various production and construction projects have made progress every year, they have still failed to catch up with the highest records during the Japanese rule. We still need to work together in the future. Now, I will explain the main points of the provincial government's policies: Regarding politics, based on the demands of the people of the province, they unanimously hope to implement constitutional government and reorganize the public opinion organs. However, this matter requires considerable time for preparation. First, we must train the people to exercise the four powers, so we have decided on five steps: (1) Promote local autonomy, (2) Improve administrative efficiency, (3) Strengthen organizations at all levels, (4) Establish a personnel system, and (5) Promote land reform policies. Regarding the economy, increase production to implement the food industry as the center. This year, it is planned to produce 1.2 million tons of food, and strictly implement the "37.5%" rent reduction, which will be used as the standard for evaluating county magistrates. Secondly, it is necessary to improve the transportation adjustment mechanism, and at the same time, it is decided to fully supply production loans to public utility agencies, but they must be repaid at the actual price of the goods. The foreign exchange earned from exports, except for the needs of the agency itself to enrich its equipment, the rest will be turned over to the provincial government for overall distribution and must not be spilled out. Regarding culture: The first is to popularize national education and fully provide funding, and the second is to equalize education so that outstanding young people have as many opportunities as possible to go to school. Chen said at the end: Governing does not require much talk, it should be expressed with facts. This administrative meeting especially hopes that all participants will be frank and review the advantages and disadvantages. Then Fu Sinian, Huang Chaoqin, Chen Zhiming, and Ge Zhizhong gave speeches respectively before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>A preparatory meeting was held in the afternoon. More than 220 members attended and passed the rules of procedure and agenda, and assigned personnel to the review小组. The大会 received a total of 407 proposals.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Newspaper Paper Allocation Stopped</h3>
<p>Chen Cheng Explains Three Reasons</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 1st] Taiwan's newspaper industry is about to face the most difficult environment. Chairman Chen has recently issued a hand order to the Paper Industry Company to stop all paper allocation to the newspaper industry from March. According to reports, 90% of the dozens of newspapers in the province rely on paper allocation for survival. Each order has an allocated price of only 50,000 yuan. If they seek it on the black market, it will cost more than 200,000 yuan. The Newspaper Association has held a meeting and decided to seek a way to survive on its own.</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 1st] Chairman Chen stated in his opening speech at the administrative meeting today that the reasons for stopping the paper allocation to newspapers are: the Paper Industry Company has been losing more than 7 billion yuan annually due to this paper allocation, which has made it impossible to increase production. He took this measure decisively in order to take into account the cost of the Paper Industry Company, avoid the suspicion of manipulating public opinion and engaging in corruption, and the current need for a large amount of paper to print textbooks. Chairman Chen hosted a luncheon for the heads of newspapers in the provincial capital this afternoon, introducing the new Director of the News Bureau, Wu Xize, and further explaining the issue of stopping paper allocation.</p>
<h3>Taipei Guest House</h3>
<p>Allocated as Library Site</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 1st] Chairman Chen recently issued a hand order to allocate the Taipei Guest House, the former residence of Chairman Wei, as the site of the Provincial Library.

<h3>Central Bank's Gold and Silver Transportation to the South; Supervisory Committee Investigation Comes to an End; The Amount Cannot Be Disclosed Due to Financial Secrets</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Regarding the Central Bank's gold and silver transportation to the south, Ni Bi and other supervisory committee members of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Supervisory District Office of the Supervisory Yuan conducted a full-day investigation at the Central Bank on the 28th. They first held talks with President Liu, and then went to various departments to conduct detailed investigations on the accounts. It has now come to an end. It is learned that the amount of gold and silver transported to the south cannot be disclosed due to government financial secrets. However, the amount currently stored in Shanghai is still very considerable, enough to control the market and stabilize finance. The location of the transportation to the south is still the Central Bank in various parts of the country, such as Fuzhou and Guangzhou. The transportation was completely stopped in early February, and the order from Acting President Li to stop the transportation was issued on February 17th, so the rumors from the outside world are mostly untrustworthy. Regarding the loan to the Central Bank in the name of Sun Ke, it is said that it was borrowed by Sun Ke on behalf of the agencies under the Executive Yuan due to relocation needs, so the various rumors about Sun are confirmed to be inaccurate. In addition, regarding the sale of Sun Ke's Shanghai residence to the Central Bank, it has also been confirmed to be inaccurate after investigation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Our City News] Liu Gongyun, President of the Central Bank, issued a statement today denying the reports in some newspapers in Hong Kong and Shanghai that he went to Hong Kong to visit Song Ziwen to discuss the transportation of gold and silver from Shanghai to the south to support the policy of free gold and silver trading.

It is understood that at least forty-three rebels have been arrested, and the number of casualties has not yet been released, but witnesses have seen two trucks full of wounded. The clashes between the army and navy in the streets of Bangkok were likely an aftershock of the open rebellion against Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkhram's military reforms. The rebels were likely followers of former Prime Minister Panomyong, who is currently in exile abroad. Panomyong is accused of involvement in the assassination of the former Siamese king and is still wanted.</p>

<h3>Hoover Commission Advocates Unifying Military Institutions</h3>
<p>Enhancing the Power of Civilians in the Department of Defense</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The government reform committee chaired by former President Hoover submitted a report today advocating the unification of military institutions and enhancing the power of civilians in the Department of Defense to control the military. The report stated that the President and the Secretary of Defense lack civilian control over the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military body. There are disagreements within the Department of Defense, leading to multiple conflicting orders and wasting national treasury. The authority of the Department of Defense should be concentrated in the Secretary. The Joint Chiefs of Staff should not act unilaterally and should be controlled by a chairman. National security depends on the cooperation and balance of the Navy, Army, and Air Force. If there is infighting, it will be extremely harmful. The Joint Chiefs of Staff is composed of the chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the President's Chief of Staff. President Truman recently appointed Eisenhower as the temporary chairman.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] Chairman Singh of the United Nations Commission on Korea stated today that the group recently requested the Soviet Union's assistance in contacting North Korean leaders to seek their views on the merger of the North and South. If the Soviet Union cannot assist, the committee may choose a location in China to contact North Korean representatives to promote North-South Korean unification. Although the work is difficult, it is not impossible. I do not hope for a miracle, but I hope to find some way to reduce the current economic, cultural, and social barriers to division. South and North Korean leaders must cooperate before they can unify. There is currently no sign of cooperation, and the situation is even more difficult than a year ago. There is little commercial or other exchange between South and North Korea.</p>
<h3>Strength of Soviet Air Force in the Far East Revealed by Soviet Pilot Who Fled to Japan</h3>

The Soviet Union has no aircraft carriers in the Far East.

<h3>United States Refuses to Extradite Soviet Pilot, Turns Him Over to Refugee Organization</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 1st] The U.S. Army Department revealed today that Soviet Army pilot Balashkov stole an aircraft and fled to Japan on November 10th last year, making an emergency landing on Raichish Island north of Hokkaido. After requesting asylum from the U.S. authorities, he has been released by the U.S. authorities and turned over to the International Refugee Organization for resettlement. Balashkov, 26 years old, fled from Vakanai on the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk in Siberia. He originally planned to fly directly to Hokkaido, but ran out of fuel and made an emergency landing on Raichish Island. At the time, he told the U.S. authorities that he was Lieutenant Masazhrov and that he was determined not to return to the Soviet Union. During the Great War in 1945, he attempted to fly to Finland to escape from the Soviet Union, but the plane crashed near a Soviet hospital and he was sent to a rear hospital. The Soviet authorities did not notice his escape plan. After he fled to Japan last year, the U.S. Far East Command immediately notified Trivianko, head of the Soviet delegation in Japan, and allowed the Soviet side to question Balashkov. Unexpectedly, the Soviet side rejected this suggestion twice, and at the same time requested that the fugitive be extradited to the Soviet delegation. The U.S. authorities pointed out that forced extradition against the will of the escapee is contrary to U.S. traditions and policies and cannot be permitted. Balashkov was finally handed over to the International Refugee Organization by the U.S. authorities for resettlement today.</p>

Committee Chairman Connally told reporters that he was "generally" satisfied with ECA Administrator Hoffman's statement that any major reduction in the $940 million earmarked for Britain would be unfortunate.</p>
<h3>Insisting on Territorial and Reparations Demands, Yugoslavia's Attitude Turns Strong Again, the Path to an Austrian Peace Treaty Remains Bleak</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 1st] Yugoslavia warned on the 1st that unless Austria is willing to make territorial concessions, further negotiations on an Austrian peace treaty would be impossible. Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Bibergle told representatives of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference that "the current border is unfair and needs to be changed." Bibergle said, "If there is no agreement on this point, all negotiations will be impossible." Bibergle said that Yugoslavia had reduced its previous demands and "sacrificed a lot." This refers to the compromise proposal put forward by Yugoslavia, which requires the four powers to accept a principle that Yugoslavia should receive territorial and reparations, and that the Slavic minority in Austria should have civil rights guarantees, some of which should be granted autonomy. Bibergle put forward this proposal last week, but Britain, the United States, and France have refused to change the borders of Austria. Representatives of Western countries believed that they were making progress in resolving the disputes between Yugoslavia and Austria, and they were very surprised by Yugoslavia's strong stance today.</p>

<h3>United Nations Reacts Coolly to Development Plans for Underdeveloped Countries, Suggests Establishing a Committee to Investigate World Labor Conditions</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 8th] After U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Thorp recently explained President Truman's plan to develop the world's underdeveloped countries to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, some representatives expressed disappointment. Indian representative Sundaram declared that the United States' draft of the Truman plan seemed to have changed the President's "brave new plan" into the "Holy Roman Empire," but it was neither "holy," nor "Roman," nor an "empire."</p>
<p>At the same time, Sundaram, like others who spoke on the plan today, expressed willingness to cooperate with what he called the "challenge to the United Nations." British representative Mayhew pledged support for the U.S. plan and said that the United States could provide technical assistance to participate in the implementation of the plan, but the United States could not provide financial assistance due to its own financial difficulties. Belgian representative Langenhove called for unanimous international action to help the economic development of underdeveloped regions. The Soviet bloc is expected to criticize the plan as another action of U.S. imperialism.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 28th] Soviet representative Tsarapkin suggested today in the Economic and Social Council to establish an investigation committee to investigate the living conditions of workers in various countries around the world. According to the Soviet proposal, the committee will also investigate allegations regarding the existence of forced labor camps in the Soviet Union and people's democracies. The committee will include representatives from the Soviet Trade Unions, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the British Trades Union Congress, and the trade unions of China, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, India, and other countries. The committee's task is to submit reports on the unemployment and working conditions of the countries it has investigated, paying particular attention to the working conditions of workers in colonial and trust territories. The Soviet Union's above proposal shows that the Soviet Union's attitude has changed greatly.</p>

In the second carriage, a middle-aged male passenger wearing a black wool overcoat, yellow leather shoes, and carrying a briefcase beckoned baggage porter No. ×× into the carriage to retrieve two 38-inch yellow soft-tire large suitcases. After getting off the train, the passenger did not exit the station, claiming that he urgently needed to transfer to Changzhou. The baggage porter told him that there was still plenty of time before departure, so he could purchase a ticket first. However, the passenger replied, "First, send the luggage onto the train to secure a good seat, I am willing to wait on the train until departure." The baggage porter complied with the passenger's wishes, leading him to the 74th Shanghai-Changzhou local train on the Beijing-Shanghai line that had just pulled into the platform, placing the two suitcases on the luggage rack, and then departed. At this time, there were still more than two hours before departure, and the train had not been marked with a train number, so there were no other passengers on the train. At 3:40 PM, a cleaner boarded the train to clean and found no one on board, but two large yellow suitcases were left on the luggage rack. The cleaner, assuming that the luggage had been forgotten by a passenger, reported it to the on-duty road police as a matter of routine. The road police officer then accompanied the cleaner onto the train to inspect the suitcases. They saw that the two suitcases were very new, and the leather material was also of high quality, but they were not locked, which raised suspicions. However, they had no authority to open the suitcases for inspection and immediately reported to Inspector Guo of the Eighth Police Station. Guo accompanied them to the train and also thought that such suitcases must contain valuable items, why not lock them, and why should they be left unattended, and it absolutely did not seem like items forgotten by a passenger, so he ordered the cleaner to move the first suitcase down, push open the suitcase lid, and saw that the suitcase was covered with white cloth and cotton. Inspector Guo probed it with his hand, soft and elastic, with a harder circular object in the middle. He pulled away the white cloth and was shocked to find that it was actually a male head. The cleaner could not help but scream in horror beside him. Inspector Guo forbade him from making noise, instructed him to keep the secret, and continued to investigate. Below the head were the chest and two arms. The second suitcase contained the lower body and two legs. The corpse was divided into seven pieces and was completely naked. After Guo completed the inspection, without showing any expression, he still placed the two suitcases in their original positions and ordered the road police to secretly monitor them. He then returned to the police station to report. After receiving the report, Police Chief Jin immediately reported to his superiors. The Police Department immediately mobilized all plainclothes officers and dispatched them separately to investigate, and also sent other officers to secretly monitor the two suitcases on the 74th train. Detectives were also deployed to Hangzhou and Changzhou. At approximately 7 PM, the Police Department received a report from the on-duty criminal police officers, stating that they had found important clues and were currently working hard to pursue them.</p>
<p>According to the railway police department's speculation, the male corpse in the suitcase was approximately 30 years old. This case may be a love triangle murder or a kidnapping case. The murderer was definitely not alone because the cut marks on the dismembered corpse were smooth and even, obviously cut with an extremely sharp knife or axe, and there was very little blood on the corpse pieces, possibly washed with water. Based on various signs, it can be concluded that this was a premeditated murder with a strict plan. The murderer must also be an exceptionally meticulous and sinister person.</p>

<h3>Three-Day Deadline to Complete Investigation of Troop Housing Occupation</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Garrison Headquarters investigation into the occupation of schools and factories by troops has only been half completed as of yesterday, and the remainder must be completed within three days. The issue of withdrawing non-essential troops is still under investigation. The rumor that more than one hundred units will be withdrawn by the 10th of this month is not accurate.

<h3>Government and Education Personnel's February Salary at 75 Times Not Yet Fully Paid</h3>
<p>The February salary for government and education personnel, which was decided to be adjusted to 75 times the original amount at the political affairs meeting held in Guangzhou on February 9th, has still not been paid out after more than ten days. In Shanghai, various agencies have only received 15 times the original amount, and some have only received 6 times, leaving employees in dire straits, even worse than before. Yesterday, some agencies received payment notification slips from the National Treasury, and after consulting with the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, they were told that payment would not be made because the payment slip issued by the National Treasury had not yet been received. The 75 times increase, which has been awaited for so long and is only enough to sustain them for a few days, is so near yet so far, causing great panic and indignation among the employees of various agencies. Subsequently, representatives from the Liaison Association of Employees of Central Agencies negotiated with the National Treasury Bureau, and as a result, central agencies originally located in Shanghai that have received the 75 times payment slip can prepare an official letter with the payment slip and submit it to the Director of the National Treasury Bureau for approval, so that they can receive payment in advance.</p>

<h3>Public Education Allowance Announced for This Month: Officials 12,000, Technicians 11,000, Laborers 6,500</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The commodity allowance and differential allowance for public education personnel for March have been approved by the Municipal Public Education Personnel Commodity Supply Committee yesterday as follows: Officials: Total of 12,000 yuan, including 3 dou of rice, 30 yuan rice allowance. 2 dan of coal briquettes, 7,200 yuan differential allowance. 3 catties of cooking oil, 1,800 yuan differential allowance. Technicians: Total of 11,000 yuan, with rice provided according to the laborers' standard, 2 dou per person, and the rest is the same as officials. Laborers: Total of 6,500 yuan, including 2 dou of rice, and the rest of the items are half of that of officials.</p>
<p>The committee also resolved the following matters yesterday: (1) In order to expedite the supplementary distribution of overdue coal briquettes to public education personnel, it was decided to appoint Zeng Gangfu, Director of the Municipal Commodity Supply Committee, Xiong Daji, Director of the Coal Briquette Adjustment Office, and Zhuang Zhixuan, representative of the Municipal Audit Office, to form a task force to plan and find ways to advance the distribution.</p>
<p>Request to the Executive Yuan for Prompt Allocation of Oil Funds</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the cooking oil for the four months from December last year to March this year, a request was submitted to the Executive Yuan and a letter was sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting the prompt allocation of oil funds. The China Vegetable Oil Factory should continue to distribute physical goods uniformly. Otherwise, the differential allowance will be re-assessed and issued according to the market price. (3) The prices of various in-kind distributions for public education personnel are odd numbers, making it impossible for the retailers to make change. Starting from March, all fractions will be waived. A request will also be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (4) In addition to the original scheduled supplementary distribution dates, public education purchase certificates will be supplemented on the 14th and 15th of each month after each distribution is completed. (5) The kerosene supply method for January and February will remain the same. If various agencies wish to purchase more than the prescribed quantity, they may also contact the oil company to purchase bulk kerosene after the first supply is completed. The quantity shall not exceed the prescribed supply quantity for each agency for one or two days. (6) Lost purchase certificates cannot be reported as lost. However, if the purchase certificate is stained with water and the writing is unclear, but the number is complete and still distinguishable, making it impossible to receive the allocated items, the service agency may issue an official letter of certification. After verification by the committee, a certificate will be issued to allow the recipient to receive the physical goods.</p>
<p>Distribution of This Month's Purchase Certificates Starts on the 3rd</p>
<p>(7) In the future, the dates for the supplementary distribution of various physical goods will not only be announced by the committee but will also be officially announced by the various supplying agencies in the Shenbao and Central News, two newspapers. (8) The distribution of March purchase certificates will start on March 3rd and will be completed by the 9th, along with the distribution of the key rice distribution certificate (distributed by the Education Bureau).</p>

<h3>Yang Chuo'an Hosts Reporters, Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yang Chuo'an, Chairman of the Emergency Procurement and Storage Committee of the Ministry of Food, yesterday afternoon hosted reporters regarding the case in which the Control Yuan impeached him and Di Zhaolin, head of the Industrial Management Section of the committee, for corruption in grain procurement during their tenure at the Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee and transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office of this city for investigation. He issued a written statement as follows: This case occurred in November of the 36th year (1947) when I was ordered by the Northeast Headquarters to purchase southern grain during my tenure at the Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee. Now that the case has been transferred to the court for investigation by the Control Yuan, I am not in a position to express my opinion during this period. Fortunately, all relevant documents relating to the handling of this case have been transferred to the court for reference. I believe that the truth will come out in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Dispute over Marriage Contract Involving Zhang Naiqi's Sister: Process from Falling in Love to Broken Relationship Only Lasts Three Months: Both Parties Express Determination to File Lawsuits</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The conflict between female doctor Zhang Xueqin and her colleague, Dr. Li Ming, due to a breakup in their relationship, has resulted in complaints being filed with the Jing'an Temple Police Precinct. Although mediation has been attempted, both parties have stated that they are determined to file lawsuits in accordance with the law in order to seek a fair resolution. Therefore, this convoluted dispute may have further developments in the coming days.</p>
<p>Zhang is the sister of Zhang Naiqi. She graduated from the Medical Department of Tokyo Imperial University in Japan and served as the Director of the Health Department of the Ningbo Municipal Government. She currently runs a hospital called New Life Hospital. Although she is 36 years old, she is still single. In early November of last year, she frequently visited the Sixth Municipal Hospital for checkups due to high blood pressure and met a Miss Li, a nurse. One day, Li invited Zhang to take a walk in the park. They passed by Li's residence at No. 25, Lane 672, Changle Road, and Li invited her in for a rest. At this time, Zhang suddenly felt unwell. Li said that there was Dr. Li Ming's clinic downstairs and immediately asked Li to come upstairs to give Zhang an injection. Zhang and Li met from then on. From that day on, Li Ming visited Zhang's home every day to treat her illness, showing great concern and warmth, and even buying medicines for Zhang to take, showing extreme diligence. By November 14th, Zhang had received a total of 42 injections, and her illness gradually improved. The 14th was Zhang's birthday, and Li immediately bought incense and gifts</p>
<p>to come and offer congratulations.</p>
<p>Zhang kept him for dinner. After a few drinks, Li expressed his love. After that, they visited each other more often, and their feelings grew stronger. On December 28th, the anniversary of Zhang's mother's death, Li personally brought funerary offerings to pay his respects. That night, he formally proposed marriage to Zhang, and at the same time, he also requested to cohabitate first. Zhang was not in favor of this and told him that love should last a lifetime and the wedding must be held. Li hesitated for a long time and then suggested that they get engaged first during the Lunar New Year, and the ceremony could be dispensed with. Zhang agreed. During the Lunar New Year, Li frankly told Zhang that his economic situation was not good and strongly stated that a fortune teller said that Zhang had "good luck for helping her husband," so he urged her to make an agreement as soon as possible. At the same time, he asked Zhang to draft a marriage contract so that it could be signed and finalized. On the 11th day of the first month, Li came, and Zhang showed him the marriage contract she had written, which included the following words: "We two have the same aspirations and are willing to love each other forever, face national difficulties together, and serve the motherland. If one party breaks the agreement in the future, the other party shall use all of its property as compensation." Li</p>
<p>laughed after reading it</p>
<p>and said: "A sentence can be added to this, that the woman allows the man to freely take concubines." After speaking, he collected the agreement. By this time, it was curfew time. After Li left, it rained and snowed. The next day, he was reported to be bedridden. On the 12th, Zhang, finding it inconvenient to inquire about his illness, sent her cousin, the wife of Liao Gongshao, the former director of the Hongkou Police Precinct, to visit and bring a letter, telling him to take care. Liao's cousin was 29 years old, beautiful and elegant, and studying at a maternity school. Unexpectedly, after she and Li met, Li fell in love with her at first sight, showing her great warmth. After several meetings, she also fell in love. At this time, Zhang's old illness relapsed. In bed, she heard the servant privately discussing the intimacy between Li and Liao's cousin.</p>
<p>This aroused suspicion.</p>
<p>Because Liao had proposed to take his cousin as a concubine, Zhang summoned Liao's cousin to question her strictly. She did not deny it and said: "Mr. Li said that you are so old, why are you still writing love letters? Aren't you ashamed?" At the same time, she said: Liao and Li are both over 40 years old. Instead of marrying Liao as a concubine, it is better to be Li's legal wife. Zhang was almost in despair after hearing this. Afterwards, she tried to find out about Li's past and learned that Li had a wife in his hometown and had already married a daughter-in-law. Li's original name before the victory was Li Ming, and he later changed his name to Li Ming, etc. She believed that Li's behavior was improper, so she decided to go to Li's residence to demand the return of the letter and the marriage contract. When she arrived, Li refused to hand them over, resulting in a conflict. In the chaos, Zhang was also injured by Li's neighbors, Chen Xiangneng and others, and as a result, she was brought to the Jing'an Temple Police Station.</p>
<p>According to Zhang, Li intentionally deceived her and his behavior was despicable. Li, on the other hand, said that Zhang had been engaged to Zhang Tianzhong, the Deputy Director of the Zhabei Police Precinct, before, but the engagement was terminated for some reason. However, Li said that he had told her in detail about his past when they met and had not concealed anything.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau's Economic Section Streamlined to Adapt to New Economic Plan</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Since the announcement of the new economic plan, some of the original organizations of the Economic Section of the Municipal Police Bureau are no longer necessary in fact. Therefore, the section will be streamlined based on current needs. In addition to merging the gold, currency, food, daily necessities, and fuel groups, the peddlers, special business groups, and economic police team will be retained. The original economic police officers will also be assigned to various precinct stations.</p>
<h3>Jewelers Encounter Pickpockets: Recovered Five Diamond and Emerald Rings</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhou Zhaozhen, a jeweler residing at No. 9, Lane 646, Nanjing West Road, boarded the No. 22 bus in front of the Jindu Grand Theatre on the morning of February 21st. Unexpectedly, a silk bag containing five diamond rings and one emerald ring, worth approximately 2 million yuan, was pickpocketed from his pocket. Zhou reported the case to the Xincheng Police Precinct for investigation. On the 28th, Section Chief Hao of the precinct received a tip that the thief in this case was attending a soup dumpling feast at the home of a Mr. Lu at No. 3, Xingye Li, Linsen West Road. He then ordered officer Wang Xiaofeng to lead the police to the location. As expected, the thief, Shen Qiusheng (age 30, from Zhenjiang), was arrested. Under strict interrogation, he confessed to his accomplices and said that he had sold three large and small diamond rings to Shao Youfang, a watch repair stall owner at the intersection of Linsen Middle Road and Zhongzheng 1st South Road, for 300,000 yuan. The rest were hidden at his home at No. 22, Zhongxian Bridge, Dongfahua Town, and given to an accomplice, etc. Subsequently, the police continued to arrest accomplices Qin Sibao and Li Huizhong, along with the receiver of stolen goods, Shao Youfang. Most of the stolen goods have been recovered, but only four diamond rings and one ring are still being tracked down.</p>
<h3>More US Aid Rice Arrives</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) in this area had another 1,000 tons of Siamese rice transported from Bangkok by the "Hongzhang" vessel yesterday. According to statistics from the ECA, the total amount of US aid rice delivered to China has now reached 181,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Relief Society Strained: Eight Soup Kitchens Reduced</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Relief Committee of this city operated 19 soup kitchens in various districts of the city during the winter to provide congee, benefiting many poor people in the suburbs. According to past practice, winter congee distribution only lasts until the end of the Lunar New Year. The committee now believes that transportation in the suburbs is inconvenient and difficult, and that some of the staff have been working hard for several months and are physically and mentally exhausted. Furthermore, the monthly requirement of rice is as much as 3,600 stones, and the committee also feels it is difficult to manage. Therefore, it has been decided to close eight of the original soup kitchens from yesterday, adopting a focus approach. The eleven soup kitchens with the most poor people will continue to distribute congee, including five in Zhabei and three each in Nanshi and Yangshupu, with a daily benefit of 43,000 people. These eleven soup kitchens are scheduled to operate for another half month. If there are no problems with the food source, it is hoped that it can be extended to one month.</p>
<h3>Decision to Establish Advisory Committee to Dredge Suzhou Creek Traffic</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The municipal authorities held a meeting yesterday in the Municipal Government meeting room to dredge the Suzhou Creek. More than 50 representatives from the Health Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and various industry associations attended, chaired by Mayor Wu. During the meeting, a resolution was passed to establish the Suzhou Creek Traffic Advisory Committee, with the chairmen of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and relevant industry associations serving as advisors, to address the issue of dredging Suzhou Creek traffic.</p>
<h3>Passengers Flying to Taiwan Before the 10th Do Not Need to Apply for Entry Permits</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Taiwan Provincial authorities have implemented measures to restrict passenger entry from yesterday, requiring all those going to Taiwan to apply for approval in advance and obtain a permit before they can enter. However, before the 10th of this month, military personnel, government employees, and general passengers traveling to Taiwan on China Airlines flights can still do so without prior application, and only need to have their identification cards. This is because the company, in order to facilitate passengers, instructed the Taipei station to negotiate with the provincial authorities and was granted a special extension of ten days. After the 10th, the company is also working with the authorities to discuss how to simplify the application procedures. In the future, the company may be able to handle entry applications on behalf of passengers at various stations in the country, in order to expedite the process.</p>
<h3>Prices of Eight Public Utilities: Implement Base Number Calculation Method: First Unit Equals 6.25 Cents Customs Gold Unit: Converted to Gold Yuan Based on Previous Day's Customs Gold Unit Price for Payment</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] After the announcement of the financial and economic reform plan, in order to cooperate with the plan to stabilize the prices of various public utilities and to seek fairness in the burden on citizens, the Municipal Government, led by Mayor Wu, Director Zhao, and Zeng Jue, exchanged views with President Liu of the National Bank several times. Based on the principles of the plan, an appropriate pricing method was found. It was decided to set a "Public Utility Calculation Unit," with each unit equivalent to 6.25 cents of the Customs Gold Unit. From now on, the prices of various public utilities in this city will be calculated according to this unit, and the payment will be converted to Gold Yuan coupons based on the Customs Gold Unit price of the previous day. Consumers who wish to prepay can pay the public utility company in advance, but only up to the amount consumed in one month. A few days ago, the Municipal Public Utility Bureau invited representatives from various public utility companies to set the price base numbers. Fang Shangui, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, attended the meeting on behalf of President Liu of the Central Bank. After careful review by all parties, the base numbers of various prices were approved and submitted to the mayor for approval. The calculation for water, electricity, gas, and telephone will start from the meter reading on the 1st of this month, and for public transportation, it will be implemented from the 3rd of this month. The various base numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Public Utility Price List Based on Public Utility Calculation Unit</p>

<p>Small Railway (per person kilometer) 〇·〇六三</p>
<p>Tram monthly and quarterly tickets for March are temporarily sold at 8,000 yuan for ordinary tickets and 4,000 yuan for public education preferential tickets.</p>
<p>Bus monthly and quarterly tickets for March are temporarily sold at 10,000 yuan in Gold Yuan for ordinary tickets and 5,000 yuan for public education preferential tickets.</p>
<p>Calculation Based on the Above Table:</p>
<p>User's Payment = Consumption × Base Number of Each Limit × Gold Yuan Conversion Rate of Public Utility Unit Price.</p>
<p>If the Customs Gold Unit price yesterday was 1120 Gold Yuan coupons, the Public Utility Unit Price would be 700 Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>Multiplying the base number published in the table above by this unit will result in the user's payment. For example, the base price of electricity for the Shanghai Electric Power Company below 10 degrees is 〇·二一一. Multiplying this by 700 is 147.7 Gold Yuan coupons. This 147.7 Gold Yuan coupon is the Gold Yuan coupon price for each degree of electricity within 10 degrees.</p>
<h3>Landlords and Tenants Unite, Making Landlords Retreat: Gu Lin Agrees to Forgo U.S. Dollars and Resolves Dispute with Revised Terms</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Over twenty households, including the Phoenix Silk Company located at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Gordon Road, were renting properties from the Russian businessman Gu Lin's real estate company. Due to Gu Lin's demand to raise the rent to US$400 per month per household, the tenants, unable to afford it, petitioned the Land Bureau for intervention. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Secretary Qian of the Land Bureau convened both the landlord and tenant representatives for mediation. Lawyer Gao Qisun represented Gu Lin, while Lawyer Ma Junshuo represented the tenants. According to Lawyer Gao, the landlord and tenants have reached a settlement: Gu Lin will no longer insist on collecting rent in U.S. dollars. The revised terms are as follows: RMB 8,000 per month for each storefront room, RMB 1,400 per month for each room on the second and third floors, and RMB 1,280 per month for each room on the fourth floor. These amounts will be calculated from last September until the Municipal Government announces new rent standards, after which the new standards will be used. The tenants generally agreed to consider these terms. However, because Lawyer Gao Qisun did not bring Gu Lin's letter of authorization, a written settlement was not reached yesterday. Secretary Qian instructed that another meeting be scheduled to allow both parties to finalize the agreement.</p>
<h3>This Month's Rice Ration Coupons Have Been Distributed to Each District; Certificate No. 7 Must Be Submitted When Claiming Shopping Coupons</h3>
<p>According to information from the People's Survey Committee: This office distributed the March household rice ration coupons to each district on February 28, to be fully distributed by March 5. All citizens who registered their household in January of this year and received an ID card should receive this rice ration coupon. Those who have not received it by March 5 should apply for a replacement from their neighborhood leader before March 8. Furthermore, due to the large population movements in the city recently, to ensure accurate distribution, it is now stipulated that when claiming the coupon, the applicant must present their national ID card for verification and submit the attached Certificate No. 7. If citizens have lost their ID card due to fire or other reasons, they can be exempted from submitting Certificate No. 7 upon providing proof from the Bao Office or publishing a lost document notice in the newspaper, and the rice coupon will still be issued.</p>
<h3>A Golden Dream Shattered: Female Employee of the Central Trust Bureau Defrauded</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of Zhou Zheng, Pan Yu, He Ruitang, and others being sued for colluding to defraud through contracting for building construction concluded after Judge Ye Guilin of the District Court held the fourth hearing yesterday morning. The verdict is scheduled for the 8th of this month. According to the plaintiff Hao Mengru (female), she was transferred from the Jinan Central Trust Bureau to the Shanghai Central Trust Bureau's Accounting Department in August of last year. She used her accumulated savings of gold, converted entirely into gold yuan, and, unfamiliar with commercial matters, decided to build a house. She entrusted the defendant Zhou Zheng to build a three-story house on Bao'an Road, agreeing on a price of 390 shih of top-quality white japonica rice. A contract was signed on September 17, with Pan Yu and He Ruitang acting as guarantors. Subsequently, she paid the defendant 220 shih in two installments (equivalent to 4,400 gold yuan at the time). However, months passed, and the defendant had not built the house, nor had he obtained the required building permit or purchased the necessary materials. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the defendant Zhou Zheng was not a construction businessman, and the "China Engineering Company" listed on the receipt was fictitious. Despite repeated inquiries to the defendants, they were evasive and ignored her, even resorting to threats and bullying a vulnerable woman. On January 9, she reported the matter to the Xincheng Police Station, which detained Zhou Zheng. She is suing the defendants for their due punishment and is also filing a civil suit.</p>
<h3>Due to Jealousy, Wang Zhongyu Indicted for Arson Twice</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Huang Xiaomei, the wife of businessman Huang Wanren, began a romantic relationship with Wang Zhongyu shortly after her husband's death. Recently, Huang became infatuated with someone else, greatly upsetting Wang.

<h3>In the Midst of Calls to "Build Hangzhou," Do Not Waste the Great Springtime</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Report from Hangzhou, 27th] The willows by West Lake are already tinged with light green. The wintersweet has faded, and the spring plums are in bloom. A peach blossom in Yellow Dragon Cave has prematurely bloomed in full. Flocks of wild ducks frolic in West Lake, knowing that this is a warm and intoxicating season. Although nature has not failed Hangzhou, the people living in Hangzhou have shattered their peaceful state of mind, anxiously concerned about current affairs. Indeed, Zhejiang has become the first line of defense in Jiangnan, and Hangzhou is only one step away from the front line. The Communist forces are on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and various counties in Zhejiang are showing signs of unrest. Tiantai was briefly occupied by local communists two days ago, and Sanmen was also once captured. Fuyang and Lin'an, near Hangzhou, often see the appearance of local communists. Rumors spread, inevitably creating a sense of alarm.</p>
<p>Special Elements Everywhere</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, people wearing disheveled military uniforms and civilian clothes are everywhere. It is impossible to determine whether these people belong to formal units or schools. The Hangzhou newspapers call them "special elements." These special elements do nothing all day long, watching movies, sitting in restaurants and teahouses, riding public buses for pleasure, bathing, and getting haircuts, all for free. They even demand money from shop owners after consuming their goods and services. Under these circumstances, barbershops once closed down, bathhouses requested protection, cinemas struggled to survive, and the public bus company considered ceasing operations.</p>
<p>Along with this chaotic scene, theft cases in the city are constantly occurring. Wuya Lane near Ying Bridge, Ping'anfang on Huixing Road, Songmuchang, and Changshouli two days ago have all experienced looting. The latter two cases involved masked thieves armed with wooden-cased guns. All of these cases occurred in February. Although the police authorities have issued strict orders to solve the cases, it will still take some effort.</p>
<p>Scars on the Roads, Dirty Water by the Side</p>
<p>Originally, with the arrival of spring, Hangzhou's merchants should have been revitalizing their businesses. Neon lights would have been lit day and night, and all local products would have been piled high. Almost every store would have had a wireless loudspeaker broadcasting excerpts from Shaoxing opera, filling the city with joy, excitement, and abundance. This spring is indeed somewhat unusual. Stores are not lavishly decorated, and even the uniquely clean and wide Hubin Road, Yingshi Road, and Yanling Road are marred by scars and potholes, with sewage overflowing along the sides of the roads. The rumbling military vehicles and "00" number sedans and jeeps have to drive forcefully on these roads. Not long ago, the lakeside of Hubin Road was full of ten-wheel trucks, with all the food and lodging inside becoming temporary dormitories. Now, they have finally driven away. However, the damage to Hubin Road is unavoidable. Various scenic spots have not been repaired and embellished due to the current situation. There are people coming to Hangzhou to play, some are fleeing and passing through Hangzhou, taking the opportunity to visit the mountains and waters, some are special elements visiting the mountains and waters, and some are coming from Shanghai to enjoy the scenery, but this is a minority. For Hangzhou, which "relies on one spring for three winters," this spring is probably worse than the usual slow season.</p>
<p>Build Hangzhou After Normalcy Returns</p>
<p>In this chaotic time, cultural activities have not fallen behind, such as the performances and exhibitions of the Drama Festival, as well as constant drama performances, music concerts, dance concerts, and various forums. There is also the Zimin Art Institute, which reportedly has departments of music, drama, fine arts, sculpture, and dance. These many cultural activities are in line with the call to build a cultural city. It is said that the landowner of the old site of the West Lake Auditorium is willing to donate the land to build an art gallery and is also willing to donate all the iron window frames of the buildings. The auditorium of the Hubin Public Education Center has been designated by the mayor as a permanent drama theater. However, all the performances have not made money because too many people watch free shows.</p>
<p>Remarkable Work in Eighty Days</p>
<p>After Hangzhou's administrative official Ren Xianqun left, he handed it over to Secretary-General Xu Xiongfei to act as his agent. Xu said to reporters, "I'm just transitional. I still want to go to school to teach in the future." Xu said this, so naturally he won't continue doing this for a long time. Who will succeed him? As of the time this reporter wrote this draft, it is not yet known. However, during Ren's tenure, although it was only a short eighty days, he did do some things, such as adjusting the salaries of public servants and teachers, getting closer to the common people, and repairing streets in the common areas. It was originally heard that not only would the old asphalt roads be paved and renewed, but asphalt roads would also be added. Now that Ren has left, we hope that the new mayor can come and tidy up. Naturally, the new mayor also has other important responsibilities, such as maintaining order and taking care of the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>We believe that this chaotic scene is only a temporary state, and it will definitely return to normal soon. We hope that after returning to a normal state, we can build Hangzhou well, and not waste this great springtime, great nature, and great environment!</p>
<h3>A Thrilling Scene: The Hua鎣 Mountain Incident—The Revolt of Several Landlords and Village Chiefs</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiduan</p>
<p>Sichuan is generally regarded as a land of peace and happiness. Unexpectedly, in this land of peace and happiness, especially near Chongqing, the lighthouse of the Anti-Japanese War, internal strife would break out – the Hua鎣 Mountain Rebellion. The name Hua鎣 Mountain initially had no significance, but today it is a term that sends chills down the spines of the people of Chongqing.</p>
<p>The Treasure Trove of Eastern Sichuan</p>
<p>Hua鎣 Mountain is a relatively unfamiliar place because it is located on the borders of several counties and is the source and watershed of several rivers. This mountain is a branch of the Daba Mountains that extends from the northeast border of Sichuan, crossing Quxian, Dazhu, Guang'an, Yuechi, Linshui, Hechuan, and other counties, all the way to the suburbs of Jiangbei, which is separated from Chongqing by water. The mountains are over 600 li long, over 1,500 meters above sea level, and 40 to 80 li thick. The mountains are full of high cliffs, deep ravines, wild trees, and barren forests. Other than the valleys around Juandongmen, there is very little arable land. In the past, there were many temples in the mountains, but now, due to the unstable situation, incense has dwindled, and monks have scattered (only Baoding remains as before). The mountains are rich in resources, but only coal and bamboo for papermaking have been exploited. Because of the small-scale traditional mining methods, production is insignificant. However, the mountains have thick forests and abundant minerals. From an economic point of view, Hua鎣 Mountain is the "treasure trove" of eastern Sichuan and the "blessed land" of Sichuan.</p>
<p>However, the continuous presence of local communists, coupled with this year's political rebellion, has turned this blessed land into a "drag" on eastern Sichuan.</p>
<p>Difficult to Attack and Defend</p>
<p>Hua鎣 Mountain is so deep, barren, and dangerous. The fan-shaped spread of the Jialing River, Qu River, and Fu River in the southwest further increases the complexity of the mountains. The political jurisdictions of various counties are intertwined, making contact and management difficult, forming a lawless zone. For many years, the mountain area has been a paradise for fugitives. In addition, the richness of the riverside and plains provides unparalleled convenience to petty criminals. However, the mountains are high, the forests are dense, and there is a lot of fog, making it difficult to attack and defend. It is extremely difficult for suppressors to attack and communicate, and supplies are not easy to obtain, making it unsuitable for long-term stationing. For local communists, without a good base, hiding is also not easy.</p>
<p>Wealthy Gentry Rising Up</p>
<p>The leading figures in this Hua鎣 Mountain rebellion were all from the bourgeoisie or local administrative cadres. In theory, these people should be the targets of the Communist Party's liquidation, but they actually initiated the uprising. Isn't that strange!</p>
<p>Now let's describe these characters.</p>
<p>The first to rise up was Zhang Shujun, the current village chief of Fulong Township in Hedong, Yuechi County. He is 22 years old and a wealthy gentry with over 2,000 mu of land. He once served as the district leader of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. His father was brutally murdered by the local communists, so his family built a strong fortress and hired guards, equipped with guns and cannons (including machine guns and submachine guns). It is said that Zhang personally led his guards to capture and kill local communists not long before the uprising. However, on the evening of August 21, he suddenly gathered his tenants and publicly burned all the land deeds and a large amount of clothing to show that the land was collectively owned and to share weal and woe, thereby gaining the support of the tenants. The next day, he formally started the uprising. The person who incited him to revolt was his brother-in-law, Chen Zheng from Hechuan (formerly the chairman of the Chongqing University Student Union). Participants in the uprising included some nearby village heads, elementary school principals, teachers, and over 300 farmers. There was also Yang Xiqin. Yang was the principal of Yuechi New Third Middle School. This school was founded by Yu Youren to commemorate his father's business in Yuechi. Their unit designation was the Seventh Detachment of the Democratic Allied Army Hua鎣 Mountain Column, with Yang Xiqin as the political instructor and Zhang as the detachment commander.</p>
<p>Village Chief Jinzi</p>
<p>The second revolt was Chen Bochun, the village chief of Jinzi Township in Hechuan. He was 26 years old and had studied at Jinling University. He joined the Communist Party because of his lover and his brother-in-law Luo Youxin (a graduate of Shanbei University). During his time in the village, he used the slogan of resisting soldiers and refusing grain, winning the support of the villagers. Later, when the Hechuan County Chief suspected him, he ordered the village to re-elect the village chief four times, but he was still elected. Later, because he was exposed for going to Chongqing to collect a wireless radio, he started the uprising on August 25. With him were the three townships of Gulou, Shengxi, and Qiantang, with a total of over 400 people and guns, organized into three rifle companies, one pistol company, and one machine gun squad, calling themselves the Fourth Detachment of the Democratic Allied Army Hua鎣 Mountain Column. Chen served as the detachment commander.</p>
<p>Councilors Participate</p>
<p>The third was Wang Pingfan, a councilor from Wusheng County. Wang was the former village chief of Shipan Township in the county. He was 32 years old and had 500 to 600 mu of land. When Chen Bochun led people and guns north along the border between Nanchong and Yuechi to meet him, he also started an uprising on August 27, with a total of over 300 people and guns. The unit designation was the Third Detachment of the Democratic Allied Army East Sichuan Column, with Wang as the detachment commander.</p>
<p>According to the confessions of the captured people and other intelligence, it was confirmed that they had planned to launch simultaneously. It was estimated that at least 5,000 to 6,000 people could be mobilized, preparing to establish three guerrilla bases between Hua鎣 Mountain, Hecheng Mountain, and Wuhe Mountain, and then expand outwards. Later, because they were detected by the government, they were forced to act hastily. There was also another Communist Party member using the alias Lao Tian who personally commanded, originally scheduled to launch in Quxian, Longtan, Juandong, Huidong, and other villages during last year's Mid-Autumn Festival, expecting 1,800 people and guns, attempting to attack Dazhu or Quxian County to obtain weapons and ammunition. As a result, the uprising was launched as scheduled. On the evening of the 20th, only 300 people attended the evening party in Dengjiawan. The participating cadres were nearby village heads, deputy village team leaders, elementary school principals, teachers, etc. The slogans at the evening party were "Divide the land," "Abolish debts," "No conscription," "No grain tax," and five or six village women sang songs and sang specially made lyrics. The unit designation was the Sixth Column of the Sichuan People's Liberation Army, with Lao Tian as the detachment commander, He Shang as the chief of staff, and Lao Fan as the commander of the Third Detachment.</p>
<p>Coercion with Guns</p>
<p>When the uprising began, Zhang Shujun crossed the Qu River to the west, and Chen Bochun and Wang Pingfan joined forces and went north along the border between Nanchong and Yuechi, coercing people with guns along the way. Local transportation was blocked, and various county towns built street-fighting fortifications. At night, every household closed their doors. The Nanchong Police Chief was beaten to death, and several county chiefs were reprimanded as a result. At that time, it was impossible to estimate their military strength, and terror and rumors spread among the people. The people were not afraid of the Communist Party, but of the war. They completely lost confidence in the strength of the government. Even in Chongqing, there was a sense of impending doom.</p>
<p>A Terrorized Area</p>
<p>At that time, the area of Hechuan, Nanchong, Wusheng, Quxian, Guang'an, and Dazhu was filled with terror and riots. The county governments also dispatched police teams and militia forces, but they were mostly passive due to the lack of ammunition and appropriate unified command. The Second Corps of the Internal Police General Team sent by Chongqing had only two companies. The Min Company engaged Zhang Shujun's troops in a fierce battle in Heier Township, Wusheng, for two hours, killing their political instructor Yang Xiqin and Zhang's brother Chen Zheng on the spot. In the pouring rain, they abandoned more than ten corpses, and a part of them fled in a panic with weapons. This battle became a sedative for stabilizing the situation.</p>
<p>Hidden Worries Have Not Disappeared</p>
<p>Afterwards, Director Zhu of the Pacification Office also sent the commander of the Second Corps of the Internal Police General Team, Peng Bin, to serve as the commander of the Hua鎣 Mountain area in Hechuan, Wusheng, and other eleven districts, and a part of the large army. Peng arrived in the Hua鎣 Mountain area on September 8. He issued a simple proclamation: "Those captured in front of the battle will be killed, and those who surrender will be allowed to reform." On one hand, he closely deployed and commanded the troops to encircle and suppress. In less than thirty days, he summoned and surrendered more than 700 people, captured more than 300 alive, shot more than 40 people, and seized more than 300 various guns. The Chen Bochun and Zhang Shujun troops were completely disintegrated. Chen and Zhang fled without being captured. Wang Pingfan committed suicide after going blind. Only a few dozen people are still hiding in the mountains.</p>
<p>The Hua鎣 Mountain rebellion has been quelled, but this land is still an uneasy place. The future troubles cannot be said to be completely eliminated. There are many civilian guns in the southwestern provinces, at least tens of millions in each county. If these weapons can be used well, they may be a strong force, otherwise they are also endless hidden worries, because natural disasters, political misfortunes, poor politics, and various other reasons cause the people to take risks. If political activities are added, it will be triggered immediately. Even if it is fortunately quelled, the loss of life and property is irreparable.</p>

<h3>Reader Consulting Legal Interpretation: A Wandering Traveler Is Exhausted; Random Medicine Casting Kills a Person</h3>
<p>Wang Qichang asks: My younger brother, Wang Qiming, 21 years old, serves in the First Company of the People's Service Corps of the Ministry of National Defense. In September of this year, because his nostrils often bled, he asked for leave to return to Huaiyin for recuperation. Unexpectedly, Huaiyin was evacuated again on December 2. He traveled alone south. He suffered from wind, frost, hunger, and cold for ten days on the road and was also pushed down and trampled. He arrived in Zhen on the afternoon of the 11th. His body was very weak, and he had slight chest pain, but he was still able to sit and walk and was not bedridden. After staying at a relative's house for one night, he ate thin rice porridge and glucose on the 2nd. In the afternoon, he took a rickshaw to Zhen Enpei Hospital for treatment. Dr. Gao Enpei of the hospital only used a stethoscope and did not examine the various parts of his body in detail, nor did he measure his temperature. He immediately concluded that it was lobar pneumonia and immediately prescribed medicine, tablets, and an injection (the type of medicine is unknown), and then immediately injected penicillin. When he was returning, his eyes were already dim. He died after about an hour. (1) The doctor failed to diagnose in detail, nor did he ask for a relative's insurance policy. It can be seen that the condition was not dangerous, but he recklessly used the medicine, causing death. Should he be held legally responsible? (2) The doctor demanded a handling fee of ninety-six yuan the morning after his death, only knowing how to get money and neglecting human life. Moreover, there have been five or six cases of negligent homicide this year, and he has been accused in the record. What punishment should this doctor receive?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) Whether the doctor is liable for negligent death should be determined by whether the result of his diagnosis is consistent with the medicine he used. (2) The doctor's request for medical expenses or handling fees is the remuneration he should receive for his business and has nothing to do with his liability for negligent death. If the doctor is indeed guilty of negligent death, you can sue him according to law and ask the prosecutor to investigate.</p>

<h3>After the Issuance of Four New Banknotes, the National Bank Fully Implements Tight Monetary Policies, Selling Gold, Foreign Exchange, Gauze, etc., Exceeding 600 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>To adapt to the actual needs, the Central Bank yesterday (the 1st) began issuing large banknotes of 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan denominations. However, the number issued was not large, so the shortage of banknotes in the market has not been resolved. It is reported that the Central Bank does not intend to release large amounts of large banknotes in order to tighten credit. As of yesterday (the 1st), the deposit balances of various banks and firms were still subject to a 30% limit.</p>
<p>After the authorities announced the tightening of the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates, the Central Bank issued four types of large banknotes yesterday. Among them, there are two types of 1,000-yuan notes, one printed by the Central Printing Plant and the other printed by the Chung Hwa Book Company. There are two types of 500-yuan notes, one from the Central Printing Plant and the other from the Chung Hwa Book Company. At the same time as the issuance of the four types of large banknotes, the Central Bank made every effort to tighten monetary policy yesterday in order to suppress the skyrocketing of prices after the issuance of the large banknotes, and also sold huge amounts of foreign exchange transfer certificates and gold. As a result, the tight monetary situation became even more severe, and the black market interest rate rose to 90%. All commodity prices were forced to remain the same. The financial market, such as gold and foreign exchange, also hovered at the original price of the previous day.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the issuance of the large banknotes, morale in all sectors was boosted, and there was a unanimous expectation for price increases. All markets showed strength in the morning, but the financial authorities made preparations in advance and sold large quantities of gold, securities, gauze, and foreign exchange transfer certificates in various markets, amounting to more than 600 million yuan. Commodity prices then declined and were roughly equal to the previous level. In the past two days, the monetary authorities have tightened monetary policy by as much as 1.2 billion yuan. The money market was extremely tight yesterday. Black market interest rates initially appeared at 70 to 80 yuan, and rose to 90 yuan near noon. Due to the lack of funds in all sectors, the momentum of price increases was suppressed. According to market observers, it will be difficult for monetary conditions to ease within the day, and prices will not rise significantly.</p>
<h3>First Lottery Draw for Short-Term Gold Bonds Today</h3>
<p>Fund Custody Committee Established</p>
<p>Listed for Trading Starting on the 4th</p>
<p>The Fund Custody Committee for the 38th Year Short-Term Gold Bonds held its inaugural meeting at the National Bank yesterday (the 1st) at 4 p.m. Finance Minister Xu Kan also flew from Guangzhou to Shanghai to attend. Committee members and government representatives Fu Rulin, Liu Gongyun, Chen Bingzhang, Zhu Huiqing of the National Federation of Commercial Associations, Xu Guomao of the National Federation of Banking Associations, Guan Nengchuang of the National Federation of Money Shops, and Zhuang Zhihuan of the Industrial Association were present. Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, served as temporary chairman and reported on the preparations. Minister Xu then delivered a speech, stating briefly that more than 4,000 taels of short-term gold bonds had been sold in the past two weeks, and the first redemption of principal for the first issue of bonds was scheduled for 10 a.m. on the 2nd of this month. The principal and interest will be paid out by the managing banks starting on the 3rd. The first payment of principal and interest funds has been allocated by the Central Bank to the managing banks for payment, and it has been approved to be listed for trading starting on the 4th of this month.</p>
<p>After the speech, the first committee meeting was held. The following were approved: (1) Election of standing committee members, with Fu Rulin, Liu Gongyun, Xu Guomao, and Chen Bingzhang to serve. (2) Public election of the chairman, with Fu Rulin elected as chairman. (3) The committee rules and operating procedures will be jointly drafted by the standing committee members and submitted for discussion at the next meeting.

It was also learned that regarding the issue of how to safeguard and receive the principal and interest funds for the first issue of bonds, the committee also decided to appoint four standing committee members to receive them. The total amount is 1,048,400 taels of gold. The first payment of principal and interest for the first issue is 50,200 taels of gold, which will be allocated by the committee to the Bank of China, Central Trust of China, the Bank of Communications and the Agricultural Bank of China on the 2nd to begin repayment. The meeting ended at 6:15 p.m.</p>
<h3>Large Fluctuations in Gold Prices Make Business Difficult for Gold Shops</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The gold market's trend yesterday went from decline to prosperity. At the initial opening, it hovered around the 149,000 to 151,000 mark. Then, because large banknotes had not yet been issued, and the tight monetary situation remained, the black market interest rate once soared to 90%. The lowest price was seen at 137,000 to 139,000. At noon, it closed at 140,000 to 142,000. In the afternoon, the market was volatile, with large fluctuations. However, as monetary conditions eased slightly, the trend was firm. The highest price was once 160,000 to 162,000, and it finally closed at 158,000 to 160,000.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The member gold shops of the Shanghai Gold Shop Association resumed formal business operations yesterday, with all members divided into three groups to coordinate market prices. However, because the gold market fluctuated greatly yesterday, the number of times the listed price changed was also high. It is estimated that the market price of 155,000 yuan per tael for selling and 145,000 yuan per tael for buying in the morning lasted longer. The lowest price for the whole day was 146,000 yuan for selling and 136,000 yuan for buying. In the afternoon, the gold market rose, and the listed price also rose step by step. Finally, the highest price of the day was listed, with 165,000 yuan for selling and 153,000 yuan for buying. The cost of exchanging old gold jewelry for new gold jewelry yesterday was set at 5,000 yuan per tael. Generally, gold shops' business was quite prosperous, and the business principle was mostly to balance buying and selling. However, many also sold short, seeing that the tight monetary situation had not eased. According to a certain authority in the industry who told reporters, given the trend of the gold market yesterday, gold shops found it quite difficult to do business. The listed price often could not correspond to the rapidly changing market price. Therefore, the difference between the buying and selling prices in the morning was only 10,000 yuan per tael, but in the afternoon, because the market fluctuated too violently, the buying and selling prices had to be raised to 12,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sudden Tightening of Monetary Conditions Leads to Chaotic Bidding for Black Market Interest Rates</h3>
<p>Transactions Made at as High as 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Due to the impact of large overnight differences in bank and firm positions and widespread rumors in the market that remittances from other cities were being withheld and that the National Bank was selling large amounts of foreign exchange certificates, the money market suddenly tightened yesterday morning. The asking prices for general overnight lending rates were extremely chaotic in the morning. The lowest price was 60 yuan, but the highest was 90 to 100 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, the overnight lending rate gradually became uniform, averaging between 70 and 80 yuan. Because all sectors heard the news of the Central Bank's large banknote issuance, everyone was searching for funds and hoarding goods, so the shortage of funds in the market was very serious. The average black market overnight interest rate in each market was around 80 to 90 yuan. Among them, the black market interest rate in the noodle, flour, silk, and other markets was as high as 90 yuan due to the lack of supply. The asking price in the cotton yarn market was low at first and then high. The asking price in the morning was between 70 and 80 yuan, but after 11 o'clock, due to the difficulty of borrowing and lending, the black market interest rate also rose to around 90 yuan. Off-exchange interest in the securities exchange was 75 to 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>The National Bank Decides to Expand the Organization of the Open Market Committee</h3>
<p>In order to curb rising prices, the Central Bank has decided to sell as much material as possible, including gold, silver, securities, and foreign exchange certificates, and to set up a separate organization to be responsible for the sales. After President Liu returned to Shanghai, he frequently consulted with the heads of various departments and exchanged views with the financial community. As a result, it has been decided to expand the organization of the Open Market Committee. The heads of national banks and bureaus will all participate in order to strengthen the force. It is reported that the committee can be established within this week. Before its establishment, the Central Bank will take action at any time depending on the market situation.</p>
<h3>The China Textile Construction Corporation Sells a Large Amount of Cloth and Receives Nearly 300 Million Yuan in Gold Yuan Certificates</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Corporation sold cloth yesterday as usual, with a total of 15 types of cloth. A total of 13,760 bolts of cloth, 15,000 pounds of leftover cloth, and 24,800 yards were sold, totaling 282,210,000 yuan in Gold Yuan Certificates.</p>
<p>Narrow Fluctuations in Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market was mostly brewing yesterday, with very little change. At the initial opening, due to the impact of the large banknote issuance, traders unanimously called for higher prices. Then, because monetary conditions tightened and demand from all parties was mediocre, the market relaxed near the close.</p>
<p>The 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 920,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan higher than before. The closing price fell to 900,000 yuan, the same as the previous day. The 40-count Blue Phoenix closed down 30,000 yuan, and the 32-count Silver Moon closed down 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The 21-count Double Horse spot goods once broke the 600,000 yuan mark, but finally fell back to 570,000 yuan at the close. The factory order rose slightly by 5,000 yuan to 535,000 yuan. The 20-count Double Horse remained at the original level of 530,000 yuan from the previous day. The other grades softened, and the 16-count changed very little.</p>
<p>The Cloth Market Trend Turns Soft</p>
<p>The cloth market trend turned slightly soft. In the early morning, due to reports of the issuance of 500-yuan and 1,000-yuan banknotes, the general psychology was boosted, but because monetary conditions in the industry tightened, those in need of funds came out one after another, leading to a decline in the market price. Near noon, it was heard that the Textile Construction Corporation was only selling second-class fine cloth and Yuan Bijin, and the situation of falling prices recovered and rebounded. As a result, it was slightly lower than before.</p>
<p>The Longtou fine cloth opened at 22,200 yuan, and then rose to 22,500 yuan, then fell to 21,300 yuan, and closed at 22,000 yuan at noon, down 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The highest price for the Sijunzi Yuan Bijin was from 20,500 yuan to 20,900 yuan. Before the close, it was slightly lower to 20,300 yuan, and finally 20,600 yuan, down 400 yuan. The Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong was only down 50 yuan. In the afternoon, off-exchange asking prices rose, and it was heard that the Sijunzi Yuan Bijin was 22,500 yuan.</p>

<h3>The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee Decides to Actively Store and Purchase Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee held a routine meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss four important matters: (1) In order to support cotton farmers and replenish raw cotton reserves, the committee decided to request the Central Bank to allocate funds sufficient to purchase and store 180,000 dan of raw cotton (approximately 20 billion yuan) in the near future in order to actively purchase cotton and entrust the Textile Construction Corporation to spin cotton yarn.</p>
<p>(2) The cotton stored in Hankou and Xi'an can be shipped to Shanghai one after another. (3) The 500,000 to 600,000 bales of cotton stored in the Xi'an area will be transported eastward along the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway and the Yangtze River and can be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities. (4) The issue of purchasing raw cotton with cash has been solved because the National Bank has issued large banknotes.</p>
<h3>The National Bank Posts Exchange Rate for US Dollars: 2,650 Gold Yuan Certificates per Dollar</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the new financial plan, foreign currency notes are still prohibited from circulation. The Central Bank should calculate the exchange rate for foreign currency based on the market price of gold and the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. It is learned that the Central Bank began posting exchange rates yesterday (the 1st) for the purchase of US dollars, with the rate set at 2,650 Gold Yuan Certificates per US dollar. This price is only for buying, not selling. The exchange rates for other countries' currencies are calculated proportionally.</p>
<h3>Excessive Negative Interest Rates Make it Difficult to Boost Buying Sentiment, and A-Shares Continue to Show Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank issued new Gold Yuan Certificates of 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan denominations. The response of the Shanghai A-share market not only did not show an increase, but generally showed a soft trend. At the initial opening, due to tight monetary conditions, all stocks opened weakly. However, the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corporation continued to reach new highs, trading at 23,570 yuan, reaching the eighth daily limit increase. Thereafter, because the trend fluctuated, both bulls and bears dared not take action easily, so the market trend became more and more downward. Yongxin Spinning opened at 3.25 yuan, following the fluctuations of off-exchange gold. The highest price was 3.41 yuan. At 11:30, the asking price for off-exchange gold gradually decreased, and the speculators in the ring increased the pressure at a high level, and retail investors generally held a wait-and-see attitude. The market became lower and lower, and the smallest price was once 3.17 yuan. At the close, because off-exchange gold was slightly higher, people's morale was slightly boosted, and the market trend returned to 3.22 yuan. The initial opening price of Meiya was 1.35 yuan. Because the Yongxin Spinning market showed a sideways trend, most retail investors concentrated on Meiya transactions, and the market trend was pulled up, with a high price of 1.50 yuan. However, because the black market interest rate was high, retail investors could not afford it, and they turned from buying to selling one after another. At 12:30, it finally fell to 1.36 yuan at the close. Among the small stocks that reached the daily limit increase, there were only three types: Yongye Real Estate at 74.3 yuan, Xinya at 0.86 yuan, and Zhenhua at 1.21 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Shares Continue to Reach New Highs</h3>
<p>The off-exchange foreign shares market continued to show a high trend. Although monetary conditions in the industry were tight, people's morale was still very boosted, and the buying intention of all groups was strong. Among them, the foreign firm group had the strongest buying appetite, so new highs continued to be seen in various stocks. Yisha traded at 6,300 yuan and 6,400 yuan. British Union traded at 6,700 yuan. Yipi traded at 950 yuan and 1,050 yuan. The Steel Industry Corporation traded at 1,450 yuan. China Paperboard traded at 1,200 yuan. Jardine Matheson traded at 18,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Market Strolls</h3>
<p>— From the Balcony of an Observer</p>
<p>Gold Shops Reopen with Smiles and Shakes of the Head</p>
<p>The gold shop industry has fully reopened, and everyone is excitedly trying to make up for the losses during the shutdown.</p>
<p>However, I asked several shopkeepers, "What good business is there to do?" Some replied with a smile, some shook their heads, and some sighed and said, "Just get by; if we can't get by, we still have to get by."</p>
<p>The reality is right in front of everyone. Although the listed prices for buying and selling are posted, most of the transactions are selling. May I ask what to use to respond to the market?</p>
<p>Of course, with the door open, you can tap on the telephone; you can go back and forth with nothing, and try your luck. This is what people who smile mean without saying a word.</p>
<p>In fact, opening the door can create another dream. That is, if there are no goods to respond to the market, you can collectively request the Central Bank to allocate real goods. Once the dream is over, I am afraid it will be time to prepare to close the shop again.</p>
<p>The market price of American silver is about 70 cents per ounce, so it is not a loss to buy the Yuan head silver coin when the market price is below 70% of the US dollar price. When it is above 70%, there is always a chance to make up for it by selling.</p>
<p>For example, yesterday the highest market price of a US dollar was 3,150 yuan, and the Yuan head price at 70% discount was 2,100 yuan. Also, the lowest price of a US dollar was 2,750 yuan, and the equivalent Yuan head price was about 1,900 yuan. If calculated according to the Central Bank's posted price, it is close.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank posted the exchange rate for the first time at 2,650 yuan per US dollar, but with the addition of the daily interest rate of 100 yuan, it was 2,890 yuan.</p>
<p>The US dollar is pegged to the price of gold, and Shanghai is used to calculating 50 yuan to one tael. Because they use this to calculate that, as long as they mess around in this triangular relationship, who is willing to do serious business?</p>
<p>Who Is Willing to Do Serious Business While Getting into the Triangle of Gold, Banknotes, and Yuan Head Silver Coins?</p>
<p>Affected by the Issuance of Large Banknotes, Rice Prices Once Strengthened. Subsequent Tight Monetary Conditions Led to a Fall in Prices. Flour Prices Stopped Rising and Turned Weak. The Oil Market Declined Slightly</p>
<p>The rice market was boosted by the introduction of large banknotes, and people's morale was high. The owners took the opportunity to raise prices, and the early opening rose by more than 1,000 yuan. In the subsequent market, due to tight monetary conditions and high black market interest rates, sellers were eager to sell, and prices fell back. The North City market's white rice was 16,000 yuan, up 200 yuan, and early Bo rice was down slightly by 100 yuan. The South City market's white rice and Bo rice were each 16,000 yuan, up slightly by 200 to 300 yuan. A total of 7,266 dan of goods arrived at the North and South markets yesterday.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>Although transactions were very firm due to the issuance of large banknotes, the market atmosphere was weak due to tight monetary conditions, and prices hovered and declined slightly. At the initial opening, soybean oil and rapeseed oil were both stable. At the close, soybean oil fell by 2,000 yuan, raw rapeseed oil was slightly weaker by 1,000 yuan, and Jiangbei old barrel raw oil was 72,000 yuan, and then 70,000 yuan. Refined rapeseed oil and small cart sesame oil both fell by 2,000 yuan, and soybean cake fell sharply by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour</p>
<p>The upward trend turned weak due to tight monetary conditions and high black market interest rates. Buyers were cautious, and actual sales were quite sluggish. The old truck retreated to the 7,000 mark, and the Warship fell by 400 yuan, closing low at 6,630 yuan. After the close, monetary conditions became even tighter, and the interest rate reached 90%. The sellers were eager to sell, and the market was full of selling voices. The market trend was again slightly lower: Hongfeng and Peacock are now at 6,600 yuan, Jiancheng at 6,500 yuan, and Dafa at 6,650 yuan. Bran supply and demand were scarce, and the market trend was slightly up. Daxin brand is now at 5,650 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Prices rose and fell differently. Due to tight monetary conditions, owners were eager to sell. Yellow soybeans generally fell by 10%, and oil mills' appetite was weak. Zha soybeans fell by 2,000 yuan, and Che soybeans fell by 10%. Raw kernels and sesame seeds were the only ones that had a strong appetite, and it was heard that large banknotes were being issued, and people's morale was firm, and the market trend continued to be firm. Hankou white sesame rose sharply by nearly 20%, and Linhuai Pass raw kernels rose again by 2,000 yuan. Corn and Green Gang were watching, and actual sales turned sluggish. Market prices fell by 300 to 500 yuan each. Red grains generally fell by 500 yuan, and green beans also saw a downward trend.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hongzhang ship returned to Shanghai from Bangkok yesterday, carrying 963 tons of US aid rice, a total of 10,000 bags, and docked at Zhongzhan Wharf for unloading. Also, the Haichuan ship transported 2,100 tons of rice and miscellaneous grains from Wuhu, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning and is now docked at the Third Pier for unloading.</p>
<h3>Large Amounts of Taiwan Sugar Arrive</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhongkai and Jiaoren ships arrived in Shanghai from Kaohsiung one after another the day before yesterday and yesterday. The Zhongkai ship carried 2,200 tons of sugar, and the Jiaoren ship carried 1,800 tons of sugar, all docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf for unloading. All of the above sugar is from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation.</p>
<h3>Not Much Tea Trading</h3>
<p>The tea reserves in this city are empty, and the trend is struggling in gasps, and is still trying to struggle. Prices are consistently hovering at peak levels. According to general opinion, the cost of tea will inevitably increase, so the future has a tendency to rise easily and difficult to fall. As for yesterday's market transactions, there is still an imbalance between sales and purchases, and only a few transactions are made.</p>
<h3>Silk Hovers</h3>
<p>The silk market situation hovered yesterday, with very little rise and fall. Initially, due to the tight monetary conditions and the black market interest rate rising to 80 or 90 yuan, retail investors sold to realize cash, and the market trend weakened. Then, it was rumored that the issuance of large banknotes was imminent, remittances from various places were being suppressed, and the tight monetary situation could be resolved, so there were still many pull-ups. However, as the tight monetary situation intensified, some traders frequently closed their positions, and the market turned into a sideways trend near the close. No. 120 Youguang new goods opened at a low price. After the opening, it was heard that the price of gold was falling step by step, and people's hearts were weak, so the market trend was unable to rise. The asking price was still waiting at a low level. Then, it was rumored that remittances from other places were being suppressed, and people's hearts turned firm, and the bullish psychology became active again. The asking price immediately rose from the 700,000 yuan range to 760,000 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, it was heard that monetary conditions eased slightly, and the price of gold also rebounded, and people's morale improved. At one point, the asking price rose to 800,000 yuan, but finally closed at 780,000 yuan. Raw silk yesterday was due to tight monetary conditions, the foreign exchange transfer certificate trend was stable, off-exchange prices were still flat, and people's hearts were weak. Superior grade zero-load opened at 920,000 and 930,000 yuan. In the middle, the price of gold fell step by step, and the market trend softened, once as low as 890,000 yuan. After the low, it was rumored that the issuance of large banknotes was imminent, and the tight monetary situation would be resolved, so people's morale was boosted, and the market price rebounded. Near noon, it closed at 910,000 yuan, slightly down 10,000 yuan. The silk market trend was stable yesterday. The city's monetary conditions carried on the huge difference in the positions of the banks and bureaus the day before, and the turnover of various industries suddenly became tight. However, it was rumored that the issuance of large banknotes made people optimistic, but because after the opening, the monetary conditions became tighter and tighter, and the black market interest rate rose from 70 yuan to 90 yuan, retail investors were unable to bear the burden, and the intention to sell was stronger, so the market trend was flat first and then weak. The initial opening price of Meiya was 510,000 yuan. Then, because the off-exchange gold price was step by step low, the market trend was unable to support it, and it immediately retreated to the 500,000 mark, and hovered at a low level for a long time. Until near the close, most of the fund shortages had been arranged smoothly, and the vitality turned slightly, and the market trend slightly improved, and finally closed at 508,000 yuan at noon.</p>
<h3>The Four Mines Joint Operating Office Adjusts Coal Prices Again</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Four Mines Joint Operating Office adjusted coal prices again yesterday. The special prices are as follows: Keelung coal 56,600 yuan, white coal nuggets 55,000 yuan, white coal lumps 83,000 yuan, white coal dust 50,000 yuan, foreign bituminous coal no goods, no market.</p>
<h3>Leping Coal Arrives One After Another, and the Supply is Expected to Improve</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of the bituminous coal allocation office who told reporters, the arrival of coal from various places in February was barely enough. A total of 11,700 tons of Kailuan coal, 15,760 tons of Soviet coal, and 52,713 tons of coal were received. The above totals 80,173 tons. In fact, the city needs 90,000 tons per month, and the Nanjing area also relies on the city for supply, needing 30,000 tons per month. The shortage still needs to be made up. However, starting from this month, Leping coal can arrive one after another, and it is estimated that 60,000 tons can arrive per month. In addition to Taiwan coal, the supply situation is expected to improve. The Four Mines Joint Operating Office has negotiated with the city's Shipping Association to lease 10 ships to transport Leping coal south in rotation. Among them, the Greater Shanghai and Tangshan ships have already begun transportation. The remaining eight ships, including Guangdong Dong, Haitian, Huaxin, Nanquang, Yongxing, Tianping, Fuxiang, and Taian, can also set sail one after another.</p>
<h3>Russian Coal Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Russian coal arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Russian ship Baronono, represented by Maotai Company, transported more than 8,000 tons of coal from Vladivostok and arrived at the port at around 3 p.m. yesterday, and is now berthed at Dongjiadu Zhongzhan Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Was Firm First and Then Returned</h3>
<p>The tung oil market yesterday appeared with a firm and profitable attitude from the morning opening, and the market rose sharply. Because after the index rose sharply, the eight major public utilities are also brewing price increases. At the same time, it was heard that the source of tung oil in Hankou and other places has been blocked, and at present it only relies on a small number of supplies from Wenzhou and Lanxi, so people's morale has progressed, and the asking price is endless. However, until the afternoon, stimulated by tight monetary conditions and the arrival of off-exchange materials, it was unable to support it and turned soft, and compared with the previous day, it was lacking in glory.</p>
<h3>The Glory of Malayan Chinese: Badminton Champions of the World</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] This is a glorious page in the history of Chinese sports. The Malayan Chinese team has won the Thomas Cup, the world badminton championship, bringing the world champion silver cup back from Scotland to keep until 1952, when they will compete with the world's strongest teams again. Chinese sports have never been able to compete in world competitions, but these few Malayan Chinese compatriots have actually won the world championship, which is a truly glorious achievement.</p>
<p>Badminton is suitable for people of all ages and genders, and can be played in all seasons. Tennis players can use it as an indoor activity in the cold season. Badminton is especially popular in Southeast Asia, where the Chinese are so passionate about it that they have produced many outstanding players. Malayan players have long had world-class standards and are famous around the world. It was expected that they would reach the top this time. I remember when the Seventh National Games were held in Shanghai last May, the Malayan Chinese delegation brought three badminton stars, who were also the heroes of this Thomas Cup victory. These three were: Huang Defu, Huang Bingshun, and Yang Guangcai. The overseas Chinese were preparing to invite them to perform their skills for the people of the country to improve the level of badminton in the country. Unfortunately, at that time, everyone was busy with other programs in the National Games and did not pay enough attention to these three world-class players. The publicity in various newspapers was also insufficient, so they quietly performed in the gymnasium and then left. The brilliance of the performance at that time, the superb skills, were truly breathtaking, defeating several Shanghai representatives such as Hong Dequan, Hou Shuji, and Li Guofan, leaving them unable to resist.</p>
<p>The Thomas Cup was initiated by Sir Thomas, the previous British badminton champion, who donated the cup. It is held every four years, with countries from all over the world participating in regional competitions, similar to the Davis Cup system. It consists of five singles and four doubles matches, with the team that wins five out of nine matches winning. Since the Malayan Chinese team participated in the competition, they have defeated all their opponents along the way, with countries bowing down in admiration. In the end, they replayed the match with the United States, which was held in Glasgow with more than 3,000 spectators. Sir Thomas personally attended the event, and tickets were sold out weeks in advance, creating an unprecedentedly grand scene. As a result, the Malayan Chinese team defeated the United States with a score of 6-3, gaining the right to compete in the final with Denmark. Among them, the American main player Freeman, who was also the world badminton singles champion, defeated Huang Defu and Huang Bingshun in fierce battles. Freeman had never lost a set in ten years, and this time, the Malayan Chinese champion Huang Defu actually won a set against him, which was a remarkable feat. On the 26th, the Malayan Chinese team competed for the championship with Denmark in Lancashire, and again won with a score of 8-1, severely defeating the Dutch army, causing global attention. Before the game, because the second singles player Huang Bingshun injured his arm and could not play, the Dutch army underestimated the Malayan Chinese team and even declared that anyone could replace him, to show their generosity. However, the Malayan Chinese team still had the third singles player Luo Defu replace him, and he actually defeated the Dutch first-ranked player Sgaropp, which was a great achievement. The Dutch army was almost completely wiped out.</p>

<h3>Basketball League Second Round: Ren Yu Defeats Mai Lings Again, Several Ties, Difference of Three Goals, Exquisite Performance, Tense Game</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The second round of the Division A Basketball League began last night. Ren Yu met Mai Lings again. After 40 minutes of fierce battle, it was difficult to determine the winner. Ren Yu finally defeated Mai Lings again with a score of 52-46. In the first half, Ren Yu was ahead by four points with a score of 25-21. Both sides demonstrated extremely clear and beautiful basketball skills. Ren Yu's shooting was particularly smooth last night, and they were able to score with ease. Wu Xinyun, Xu Zhongyi, and Sun Guozheng, the three musketeers, stood out and scored the most points. Mai Lings has many talents and is well-rounded, with tall players who scored many points through high-ball passes. It was not easy for Ren Yu to overcome the difficulties in this environment with low-ball tactics. Mai Lings improved each time, and although they lost, their performance was quite remarkable. Two games in Division B: (1) Hui Li B defeated Hua Nan by a large margin, 63-35, with the first half score being 24-22. (2) Xi Qing Basketball defeated Typhoon, 32-30, with the first half score being 18-13.</p>
<p>In the first 20 minutes, Mai Lings led by 1-2 points and 2-3 points in the first 10 minutes, before the score tied at 12 each, making the game extremely tense. In the second 10 minutes, Mai Lings played with their formal lineup, but it was still difficult to distinguish the winner, and there were ties at 16, 19, and a total of six times. Ren Yu started to break through, taking the lead with 25-21 in the first half. At the start of the battle, Ren Yu sent Yao Wenyi, Shen Pengju, Cai Jindian, Li Zhaohe, and Xu Zhongyi onto the court. Mai Lings' Brahman opened the scoring, and Ren Yu's Zhongyi and Jindian responded with three points. Gu Dihuaerfu added two goals, and Cai and Xu tied the score at 6 each. Punk Kiddong showed his color again, and Mai Lings led again with 8-6. Zhaohe and Peng made one free throw each, surpassing the score with 9-8. Zhongyi made a free throw, and Ounas tied the score at 10. Ren Yu's passing was brilliant, and they continued to tie the score at 12.

Russia tied the score at 16, and Remsay and Lees scored, with Sun Guozheng pulling the score to 19 each (this was the sixth tie). Guozheng showed his skills under the basket, and Xinyun followed suit. Ren Yu's players made contributions one after another, finally allowing them to breathe. In the first half, Ren Yu led by four points with a score of 25-21.</p>
<p>In the second half, Mai Lings came on strong, scoring continuously and immediately tying the score at 27 each. The scores went up and down, making the game extremely tense. Fortunately, Xinyun and Guozheng made consecutive shots, and Ren Yu saw the opportunity to raise their heads again. Mai Lings chased hard, and the score was 38-36, 42-40, only two points behind. At this time, both sides were eager to win, and Mai Lings focused on attacking, which greatly relaxed their defense, leaving many loopholes. Ren Yu's balls entered the net one after another. Mai Lings' situation was over, and they could not recover. The final score was 52-46, and Ren Yu defeated Mai Lings again.</p>

<h3>"Airbag" Chen Zhennan Invited to Swim in the Philippines: Departs Today to Participate in the 400m and 1500m Events</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hong Kong, 1st] Water hero Chen Zhennan recently received a letter from the Philippine swimming community, inviting him to compete in the Philippines. In addition to Chen Zhennan, Liang Aimei, S. Anderson, and H. Anderson were also invited, but the above three were unable to accept the invitation due to circumstances. Only Chen Zhennan departed on the 2nd. The Hong Kong Chinese swimming community held a grand banquet for him on the evening of the 28th, wishing him success.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong Aviation News, 28th] Chen Zhennan, a long-distance swimming star known as the "Airbag" and the "treasure of the Lijing Swimming Team," has been specially invited by the Philippine Sports Federation to participate in the All-Philippine Open Swimming Competition held on the 5th and 6th of next month. This is an open international competition, and water monsters from any country or region can sign up to participate and show their skills. However, according to regulations, each athlete is responsible for their own travel expenses. Chen Zhennan is an exception, and all expenses for meals, accommodation, and round-trip air tickets are covered by the Philippines.</p>
<p>Japan was originally the "Swimming Kingdom" of the Far East, with results comparable to those of top American players. However, due to the non-signing of the treaty, Japan's qualifications in the international sports arena have not yet been restored, and the Philippines did not invite them to participate in this competition. Although the Japanese youth Furuhashi has repeatedly broken the world records for 400m and 1500m.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Kimba, the secretary-general of the World Swimming Association, a key figure, has been trying to restore the qualifications of the Japanese swimming community for international competitions and plans to invite Furuhashi to perform in the United States. However, this is just a personal plan of Kimba, and he still needs to work hard to clear the way. It is too early to say at the moment. However, this secretary of the World Swimming Association confidently told a reporter from a Western newspaper in Australia: "Before the next World Games, Japan will definitely be able to restore its qualifications for international sports competitions."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhennan and his coach Huang Shaoxiong went to Victoria Club a few days ago by appointment and discussed the departure to the Philippines with the club secretary. Fatty Nan said to him: "Although I still swim regularly in the cold winter, the pool water is too cold, so the results are naturally not as good as during the swimming season. Moreover, this time I am going to a major competition overseas alone, and the coach cannot accompany me. I am afraid that I will fail and lose face for the Hong Kong and Philippine Chinese communities." He showed hesitation about this trip to the Philippines, without any confidence of victory.</p>
<p>After the encouragement of the Victoria Secretary and Coach Huang, Zhennan finally formally signed the contract to go to the Philippines and decided to depart on the Pan American plane on the 2nd of next month and participate in the competition on the 5th and 6th. The events have also been confirmed as 400m and 1500m. After the competition, he is scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the Pan American plane on the 8th. The entry procedures for going to the Philippines are quite troublesome. According to people in the Victoria Club, they have heard that Morse, the manager of the Shanghai Bank, has been helping Chen with this matter.</p>
<p>The competition will undoubtedly be held at the Philippine National Rizal Swimming Stadium. This is a 50-meter-long white porcelain swimming pool, which is different in length from Victoria and Chung Ching. Because all swimming competitions in Hong Kong are based on the "yard system" set by the British Swimming Association, while all swimming competitions in the Philippines are based on the "meter system" of the World Games swimming rules under the leadership of the Americans. Meters are longer than yards, so 1500 meters is also longer than 1600 yards. Chen Zhennan is known as the "Airbag."</p>
<p>Fatty Chen Zhennan</p>
<h3>Philippine Athlete Maba is Fatty Nan's Strongest Rival</h3>
<p>In the last Hong Kong-Philippine inter-city swimming competition, Chen competed with Philippine athlete Maba in the 880-yard race. Although Chen unfortunately finished as the runner-up by a narrow margin, his inexhaustible strength in the later stages surprised everyone. Therefore, this time when he goes to the Philippines, we don't have much expectation for Chen's 400 meters, but we would be satisfied if he can be nominated. However, in the 1500-meter event, I believe that he can defeat the Philippine "long-distance swimming king" Mr. Maba, and wash away the shame of losing by a narrow margin in the 880-yard race in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>However, the Philippines is a sea island with eternal spring, and the weather there seems to be more suitable for training water sports than Hong Kong. Maba may have made great progress in the past few months. However, as my brother Huang Shaoxiong said, "If Zhennan can maintain his best record of 21 minutes and 22.2 seconds in the 1500 meters, he can definitely win the championship in this international competition and make a name for himself overseas, bringing glory to the Hong Kong overseas Chinese."</p>
<p>It is found that "Fatty Nan" weighs 180 pounds and has won the cross-sea championship for three consecutive times. Last year, he won the championships in the 220, 440, and 883 open competitions in Hong Kong. He made many contributions in the Hong Kong-Philippine inter-city competition.</p>
<h3>Armored Forces Basketball Tournament Decides Champion Today</h3>
<p>The basketball tournament organized by the Army Armored Forces Command has reached the final stage after several days of competition. In yesterday's two games, the Armored Forces School defeated the Second Independent Battalion 45-18, and the First Regiment defeated the Second Regiment 27-25 by one point, both winning the right to the final and will compete for the championship at 2:00 pm today.</p>
<h3>China Industrial and Commercial College: Principal Change Dispute Resolved, Classes Start on the 4th</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The dispute over the change of principal at China Industrial and Commercial College in this city has attracted attention from all parties in recent days due to the publication of announcements by Principal Shen Sizhuang and the school board Yang Weiyu in the newspapers, and professors and students have also been involved in the vortex. Some students paid fees and registered at the China Vocational Education Society, while others paid fees and registered at the original school, and the school has a tendency to split into two. The school board members could not bear to see the school they founded fall into this situation, so they mediated the dispute. Yesterday afternoon, the school board held a meeting at the China Vocational Education Society, discussing for more than three hours, and the dispute will be resolved soon.</p>
<p>It has now been decided that all students will start classes at the original site of Rongyuan on Yongjia Road from the 4th (Friday). Gu Shusen, the school board member and acting principal recommended by the school board, will go to the school today to discuss everything with Principal Shen Sizhuang.</p>
<h3>Malayan Chinese Continue to Participate in the All-England Badminton Championships: Believe that at Least Two of the Five Championships Can Be Won</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London Broadcasting: According to observations by badminton professionals here, the All-England Badminton Championships this year will undergo major changes due to the participation of the Malayan Chinese team, which recently won the Thomas Cup in a winning streak. It is believed that at least two of the five championships will be won by Malayan Chinese. The importance of the All-England Badminton Championships can be compared with the Wimbledon Annual Tennis Championships. This year's competition will be held in Haringey.</p>
<p>The strength of the Malayan female players has not yet been speculated as they have not yet formally appeared. However, badminton observers here believe that if the technical level of the Malayan Chinese women is proportional to that of the men, then in mixed doubles, players from other countries will be difficult to avoid defeat and humiliation.</p>
<p>In men's singles, the "Sunday Express" nominated Huang Bingshun as the most outstanding player.</p>
<p>Based on their performance in defeating the United States and Danish teams in international competitions, the Malayan doubles teams have already secured the championship title.</p>
<p>This year's competition has an unprecedented number of participants, reaching 176. Players from the United States, Denmark, India, South Africa, Sweden, and other countries have all participated.</p>
<h3>Suggest that Badminton Should be Included as a Championship Event in the National Games</h3>
<p>The Malayan Chinese badminton team won the first Thomas Cup overseas with excellent and outstanding performances. Although they represented British Malaya this time, all the team members from the leader to the reserve members were Chinese players. This should be an unprecedented honor for the sports community in our country.</p>
<p>Reuters sports editor Morgan said in a dispatch: "No one will deny that Malaya is a commendable world hegemon in the badminton world, which also gives some comfort to Sir Thomas, who donated the cup."</p>
<p>The Malayan Chinese team came from afar and spent a lot of money, but they finally succeeded, establishing an irrefutable honor - they are the best badminton players in the entire universe.</p>
<p>The Malayan Chinese team not only had amazing performances in their skills, but their sportsmanship on the court and their politeness off the court can be used as models. Anyone who donates to them should consider themselves satisfied - their money has not been wasted.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in Malaya should be proud of this group of badminton ambassadors. Their motto is: "We want to win, but we want to win with enough sportsmanlike demeanor. If we lose, we also want to lose beautifully. At the very least, we have done our best and strength."</p>
<p>I remember during the National Games, when these Malayan Chinese comets performed in the gymnasium, Li Guofan, the top badminton player in Shanghai, made a good analogy: "He (referring to Huang Bingshun) paced on the court, while the opponent was running desperately there!"</p>
<p>Badminton was not invented by the Chinese, but the first Thomas Cup fell into the hands of the Chinese. This is not only an honor for the Chinese, but it also makes us realize that the Chinese have the talent to play badminton. We suggest that badminton should be officially included as an event in the National Games, and should no longer be a demonstration match.</p>
<p>Fortunately, badminton equipment is simple and the cost is cheap, which can be afforded by the general economic strength of the people of the country. - May all the badminton championships in the world come to us from now on. (Ai Lian)</p>
