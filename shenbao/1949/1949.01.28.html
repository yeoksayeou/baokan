<h3>李宗仁致電毛澤東　促派代表開始談判　說明今日之事已非一黨一人之榮辱　盼能迅消兵召革致祥和</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕李代總統廿七日致電毛澤東，促其派遺代表商定地點，開始和談，原電云：潤之先生勛鑒，自政協破裂，繼八年對外抗戰之後，內戰達三年有餘，國家元氣大傷，人民痛苦萬狀，弭戰謀和，已成為今日全國一致之呼聲，故自弟主政之日起，卽決心以最高之誠意，盡最大之努力，務期促成和平之實現。弟於廿二日所發出之聲明及所致任潮，衡山，伯鈞，東蓀諸先生之電，計均已早邀亮督，國家今日殘破如此之甚，人民痛苦如此之深，田園城市之摧毀，無辜人民之死傷，不可勝計，而妻離子散，啼饑號寒者，復隨處皆是，此悉由於戰爭所招致，以往國共兩黨在孫中山先生領導下，曾共同致力中國革命，不幸終因政見紛歧，鬩牆鬥起，致使國家人民遭此慘禍，撫今追昔，能不痛心，吾人果認為革命之目的在於增進人民與國家之利益，革命之動機基於大多數人民之意旨，則無論國共兩黨所持之主張與政見如何不同，在今日之情勢下，決無繼續訴諸武力，互相廝殺，以加重人民與國家痛苦之理由，亦除遵循全國民意，弭戰謀和，從事政治解決之外，別無其他途徑可循。否則吾人之罪誠將百身莫贖，先生以往曾一再宣示，願意尋求和平解決，現政府方面已從言論與行動上表明和平之誠意，所有以往全國各方人士所要求者，如釋放政治犯，開放言論，保障人民自由等均在逐步實施，事實俱在，何得謂虛，務望先生號召貴黨同志，共同迅速促成和談，卽日派遣代表，商定地點，開始談判，戰爭能阜一日停止，卽保存萬千之國民生命，减少萬千之孤兒寡婦，果能共體時艱，開誠相見，一切當可獲得解決。貴方所提八項條件，政府方面已承認可以此作為基礎，進行和談，各項問題，自均可在談判中商討決定。在雙方商討尙未開始以前，郎要求對方必須先行執行某項條件，則何能謂之為和談，以往恩怨是非倘加過分重視，則仇仇相報，寗有已時，哀吾同胞，恐無唯類，先生與弟將同為民族千古之罪人矣。抑尤有進者，貴方廣播屢謂政府此次倡導和平，為政府與某國勾結之陰謀，此種觀點，顯係某於某種成見而來，弟自抗戰迄今，對外政策，夙主親仁善鄰，無所軒輊，凡有助於我國之和平建設，均應與之密切合作，今後亦惟有循此原則，以確保東亞和平與我國之獨立自主。先生明達，當引為然，總之，今日之事，非一黨一人之榮辱，而為國家命脈，人民生死之所繫，弟個人亦決無絲毫成見與得失之心，如能迅消兵革，召致祥和，俾得早卸仔肩，遂我初服，固听時刻聲香禱祝者，掬誠佈悃，希卓栽見復為幸，弟李宗仁一月廿七日京秘印。</p>
<h3>國防部各首長　舉行重要會議　張治中今晨飛漢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕李代總統廿七日上午在國防部召集國防部各首長舉行會議，到徐永昌，顧祝同，湯恩伯，周至柔，桂永淸等數人，聞有重要會商。午間幷邀宴立委尹述賢，黃宇人，邱昌渭等，席間交換對當前時局之意見甚多，尤對中共連日之廣播內容有所研討。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕政府誠意謀和之決心，並未因中共連日之廣播有所動搖，接近李代總統人士表示，代總統仍持盡其在我之能度，繼續為和平而努力。政府之謀和係具有最高誠意，故目前仍靜待中共推派代表，指定代表人選，傳立卽能進行為人民謀福利之和平工作，惟很據記者廿七日竟日分訪各方所獲之觀感，均因中共之廣播而有感於和平前途之黯淡，若干人士且已表示消極之意。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕張治中將於廿八日晨專機飛返西北，李品仙同行赴漢，張氏過漢時，可能小停，然後逕飛蘭州。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿七日電〕邵力子吿中國記者稱，政府代表團已準備就緒，隨時可飛北平。此間推測紛紜，有謂代表團或將不待中共首肯卽擬赴平者，然靈通人士認此訊不確。</p>
<h3>京敎授組人民代表團　定明日飛赴北平　傳達眞正民意俾促成全面和平</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕中國和平策進會，中國各大學敎授國策研究會合組之人民和平代表團吳裕後等七敎授，向政府借用交通工具，遄赴北平，呼籲和平，聞政院已允撥借飛機一架，該團為立即拯救人民免於戰禍，不辭勞瘁，擬於廿九日（農曆元旦）飛赴北平，轉達人民眞正期望，俾能促成全面和平，茲分誌其致葉劍英，鄧寳珊，周炳琳諸氏原電如次：</p>
<p>（一）北平聯合辦事處葉劍英先生並轉毛澤東先生勛鑒，八年抗戰，元氣已傷，三載內爭，國脈垂絕，人民塗炭，亟需和平，本會一月以來奔走呼籲，諒蒙洞鑒，近日各方傳聞和平前途轉趨黯淡，而人民祈求和平之情，益形迫切，本會為傳達眞正民意，特組織人民和平代表團，計代表及記者共為十人，於本月廿九日晨十時由南京飛赴北平，約於同日午後二時抵達，敬希轉知治安人員，惠予照料，至所企幸，先此電達，諸維察照，中國人民和平策進會，中國各大學國策研究會同叩。廿七日印。</p>

<h3>美國務院令司使　留京採觀望政策</h3>
<p>克拉克率小批職員赴穗</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿七日電〕今夜確悉，美國務院已訓令駐華大使司徒雷登，繼續留京採取「觀望」政策，一面由公使銜參事克拉克率領小批職員隨同中國政府遷往廣州。預料美方此舉將對此間西方各國外交使節之行動有決定性影響。北大西洋集團各國使節在最近十八小時來曾舉行三次會議，討論是否南遷問題。多數使館現仍等待本國政府訓令行事。至於蘇聯大使館與捷克及彼蘭等國使館或將恪遵國書規定，隨同南遷。</p>
<h3>童冠賢在滬　招待立委</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕立法院長童冠賢氏由京抵滬，昨日下午三時假新生活俱樂部舉行茶會，招待在滬立委到七十餘人，首由童氏致詞，謂茶會目的在報吿政府遷移情形，行政院現決定二月五日在穗辦公，立院大會原定二月一日召開，因目前局勢關係在京開會困難，故決定於二月中旬在穗復會，現在必須立卽作遷移準備，廣州會址已由副院長劉健羣負責設法中，將來立委赴穗開會旅費，已治准政院，由政府給付。立院職員大部自動遺散，留京辦公者巳不足一百人。繼由陳顧遠，方志超發言，主張立院為促成和平實現，應在京滬附近覓地復會，不宜南遷，張慶楨等多人則認立院應設於首都所在地，且如不遷移，易滋流弊，但主遷穗後應卽切實檢討立院過去所有決議建議，是否均已為政府接受實行，並對公敎人員待遇遲不調整，存兌之辦法出爾反爾，各地當局對釋放被拘學生置之不理等加以指責，咸主今後立院應充分發揮其作用。繼由童氏答復：立法行政兩院關係密切，故立院非遷不可，目前問題在如何解決各項遷移困難，俾於二月份內如期在穗開會，立院已決定在滬·穗·桂林三地分設辦事處，辦理遷移事宜，上海方面請馬樹禮氏負責聯系登記，旋卽於六時散會。又悉：童氏定今日返京。</p>
<h3>美援戰鬥機　卅架運抵台</h3>
<p>〔本報台北廿七日電〕野馬式戰鬥機約三十架，三日前由美運到基隆港卸下，此批飛機乃為美軍事援華撥款所購，雖未免對於援華太晚，據悉：今後將續有運來。</p>
<h3>釋放張學良命令　陳誠稱尙未到達</h3>
<p>鄧錫侯飭淸查楊虎城案</p>
<p>〔本報台北廿七日電〕陳誠主席今午三時接見往訪記者，對釋放張學良問題之詢問答稱，命令尙未到達，張氏所居之井上溫泉，刻仍拒絕訪問。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿七日電〕鄧錫侯廿七日下午四時邀劉雨卿·晏玉琮·李寳密商，與會人員對有關楊虎城事仍拒透露，李氏且表示不淸楚，晏氏則稱今晨確有二軍機由京來渝，內一架任務不明，惟絕非載楊虎城飛京。鄧錫侯整日避見記者，下午四時派曾文先稱，正飭屬淸查楊虎城案。</p>
<h3>澳艦一艘將駛京</h3>
<p>接替英艦黑天鵝號任務</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿七日電〕澳洲驅逐艦「　拉蒙」號，將於二十九日自日本抵此，代替英艦「黑天鵝」號，留駐江中，以備萬一，預定三星期後駛返澳洲。</p>
<h3>美使館郵機一架　飛平後當日返京</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿七日電〕美大使館郵機一架今日飛北平，在天壇機塲降落，旋卽　歸來，沿途並無意外，此為共黨接收北平以來訪問該地之第一架外國飛機。</p>
<h3>孫科吳鐵城來滬　日內飛穗主持行政院務</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕政府決定遷都後，除政院各部會於下月五日在穗辦公外，各部會首長則定一日起赴穗，行政院長孫科，副院長吳鐵城已於廿七日飛滬，卽可轉穗。政治中心卽將自京移華南，惟等待中共反應而進行和談之人士，則仍留京。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院副院長吳鐵城昨日上午十一時由京飛抵滬，午後在望廬私邸接見賓客甚多。吳氏日內卽搭機飛穗，主持政務，在滬不致有重要政治活動，但亦可能以私人資格，便晤此間第三方面人士，交換時局意見，院長孫科聞亦於昨日抵滬，但孫寓堅稱院長尙在京。又政院自二月份起，即在穗辦公，芷副院長自將親往主持，兩氏來滬，當為過路性質。</p>
<h3>駐華美海軍陸戰隊　一部份即將撤退　訓練國軍計劃宣各終止</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕美國西太平洋海軍司令白吉爾廿七日招待記者稱：一部份美海軍陸戰隊卽將由中國撤退，但擬保留充份實力，以應付任何意外。現駐中國之陸戰隊，計靑島約三千，上海六百，人數已超過需要。靑島陸戰隊一部份正由岸上營房移至兵艦，惟在艦上留駐多人，未免無謂，其不需要者，不如遺往關島等處。白氏對駐華陸戰隊將减去多少及是否影響到駐滬陸戰隊，並未發表，但認為陸戰隊留居艦上，按照國際公法，並不侵犯駐在國主權，美國在華維持充份兵力，以防發生暴動與保護美僑及其他外僑之海軍政策，將無變動。白氏希望，中國各地之易手均如北平之安謐。美海軍及陸　隊對中國內戰並不參加，　將嚴格遵守不干涉政策。或問共產黨統治中國後，如要求美海軍撤退則如何，白氏答稱，予或將予以撤退，但此應由政府決定，予祇知奉命行事，並視防止暴動及保護僑民之需要而定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社珍珠港廿六日電〕美國太平洋艦隊　令部今日宣布，驅逐艦「鄧肯」號，「潘金斯」號，「羅傑斯」號與「杜克」號四艘，昨日開往青島，入西太平洋艦隊服務，此舉乃「該區例行調防性質」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿七日電〕美國正式終止其為國民黨中國之軍事訓練計劃。此舉可除去國共和平路上之另一障碍。中共曾指斥美一軍事團體積極協助政府作戰，而美國則加以否認。除幾個美國軍事人員外，彼等已於廿七日自上海盡數搭輪赴日返美。</p>
<h3>北平聯合辦事機構　共方代表已決定　國軍移駐城外事尙有小問題</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕北平聯合辦事機構共方代表人選巳決定為葉劍英·徐冰·陶鑄·戎十和等四人，聞已有一部入城，姓名未悉。李副總統及白崇禧所遺之私人代表，刻仍在平為全面和平奔走，然活動情形則無所悉。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕共軍仍未入城，相當數目之國軍仍留駐城內，街頭崗哨密佈，市上百物飛漲，故都凋年殘景，和平中難掩緊張之情。據聞，關於國軍移駐城外事仍有小問題，待雙方商決，春節前共軍殊少入城可能。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿七日電〕共方仍居幕後策動，所有各公共機關如公用及電訊事業等均由政府原任人員管理，使人不易相信北平已歸共方統治。報載共方負責人員宣布，凡未經准許而企圖接收以上各機關者，將予懲處。惟一俟過渡時期終了後，共方必將公開管理北平。北大學生籌備作大規模遊行，慶祝解放軍隊之到來，及得脫精神牢獄之禁錮。北大及師大敎授三十二人亦聯名發表宣言，擁護毛澤東所提入項條件為眞正和平之惟一根據。</p>
<h3>共軍自動向北撤退　國軍進入揚州城　儀徴並未撤守昨已解圍</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿七日電〕侵入揚州城內之共軍　毅部十三縱隊一個連，廿七日晨九時已由便益門自動向北撤退，駐防施家橋之國軍第四軍王作華部五十九師聞訊，當卽向揚州推進，沿途并未遭遇任何抵抗，安然入城。聞國軍另一部已由鎭　綫之龍窩口向泰縣方面推進。刻國軍正加派勁旅，星夜渡江北工，留於瓜州待命之江都縣長周德霖，定廿八日率同工作人員赴揚，鎭（江）圩（六圩）鎭（江）口（岸）班輪亦將恢復。現鎭江廿萬市民，正以一顆愉快的心情，來迎接新春。又：儀徴方面廿七日晨經援軍趕到，業已解圍（前傳撤守說不確），縣城仍在駐軍堅守中。</p>
<p>〔中央社鎭江廿七日電〕江北情况今日全部安靜，靖江方面我有力部隊增援，情况極佳，口岸方面我亦有增援，六圩，瓜州一帶昨今兩次增援，今下午四時已向施家橋土共搜索前進，儀徴今日雙言無活動，總計在蘇北之共軍，幷無正式主力，裝備極劣，無進攻能力。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕汪陰對岸靖江城已於廿六日黎明前被共軍千餘侵入。又，入駐揚州共軍，據報為顧維衡部之高揚獨立團，揚州以南瓜州古渡頭廿六日起連絡亦中斷。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕江南防綫東起崇明，西迄蕪湖，國軍不僅早就崗位，完成佈置，且已於共黨延遲和談加速軍事攻勢下，抽精銳部隊，如傘兵等，完成機動師之編組，此項機動師均以十輸卡運送，每一戰士皆為輕電機槍手，俾於漫長江防綫上任何一處被共軍小股偷渡後，得迅速趕至，將其殲滅。此外，長江民船業已大多召至南岸。據悉；陳毅雖已陳兵江北，但大舉渡江則尙待林彪部之南下與增援。</p>

<h3>共軍如仍節節進攻　國軍決作自衛抵抗　鄧文儀在記者招待會談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕國防部發言人鄧文儀，廿七日下午在記者招待會上談稱：自政府號召和平後，國軍為遵照政府決策，卽採取退守策略，現國軍已撤至畏江防綫，惟共軍仍飭節進攻，國軍爲自衛計，在長江防綫決予抵抗。現共軍集中於蘇北及津浦綫兩側者共發現有十個縱隊，泰縣及揚州一帶約有四個縱隊，係陝毅主力，津浦正面及兩側尙有六個縱隊，惟每一縱隊不過一萬人，合計約二十萬人左右，國軍之兵力則在三十萬人以上，加之有海空軍配合，相信如共軍來犯，定將遭受嚴重打擊。據鄧氏稱：津浦正面共軍現抵達浦鎮以北三十華里之鳥衣，預料下週內共軍可能發動攻勢。</p>
<h3>國防部發表　一週戰況</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕國防部今日發表一月廿日至廿六日止一週戰局如次：道一週，為了遵循政院無條件停戰的決議，與促進舉國上下一致熱望的和平早日實現，各地國軍曾先後主動撤離若干地區，以示和平的誠意，故除了少數地區由於共軍進犯，國軍有小規模抵抗與前哨接觸外，大體很平靜，但亦有部份共軍不斷回國軍進犯，國軍一再忍讓之餘，也曾予以還擊。茲分述於後：</p>
<p>（一）江淮地區　共軍連日正不顧全國人民對和平的熱望，着着向南進逼，已有數處迫近長江北岸；國軍為遵從政府決策，並表示對謀和確具誠意，津浦綫國軍於十九日自動撤離蚌埠，廿三日撤離滁縣，蘇北國軍於廿二日撤離如皐，廿四日撤出揚州，皖北國軍廿一撤離合肥，廿四日撤離葉縣，並分別自明光·嘉山·張八嶺·全椒以及蘇北泰縣等地忍讓，共軍沿　浦綫南下的先頭部隊，為陳毅所部第十二縱隊及江淮獨立旅第三十四旅，曾與國軍發生接觸，其後續部隊為陳毅所部九個縱隊，其中四個縱隊已到達揚州·高郵及六合·天長縣境，另五個縱隊亦正沿津浦綫南下，到達渝縣附近。共軍雖着着逼人，大有最近發動更大攻勢模樣，然其實力有限，每一總隊僅萬餘人，且我長江防務早經嚴密部署，故如共軍偷渡長江，絕難得逞。國軍現在長江北岸泰縣·揚州以南儀徵·江浦等地，仍確保若干重要前衛基地，長江攻防戰萬一不能避免，則共軍應付之代價必比徐蚌會戰更重，國軍可收天時地利人和之效，戰局前途定可改觀。</p>
<p>（二）華北方面　為了縮短戰爭，獲致和平，藉以保全北平故都基礎與文物古蹟，傅總司令作義，曾於二十二日發表文吿，宣佈自二十二日上午十時起休戰，平市國軍大部當卽遵從總部指示，先後撤離市區，開入指定地點，共軍已有小部開進市區，綏遠大同兩地亦將實施休戰。</p>
<p>（三）隴東方面　枸邑一帶有共軍一千六百餘人，二十一日共軍不斷向國軍進攻，我隴東兵團為自衛起見，當卽予以反擊，激戰僅四小時，當將該部共軍新二十一團全部殲滅，計打死共軍七百餘，生俘四百餘。由於隴東之捷，足證共軍如仍執迷不悟，將必在全國人民之憎恨下，遭致命之打擊。</p>
<p>（四）蘇北方面　國軍刻扼守揚州以南迄儀徵之綫，二十二夜有共軍一部向儀徵進襲，戰事持續，至二十三晚守軍當將來犯共軍擊退。六合方面，二十二晚亦有共軍二千餘來犯，守軍當卽猛力予以還擊，戰爭刻尙在附近繼續中。</p>
<p>總之，鑒於過去一月及最近一週之事實，共軍奄無和平誠意，仍然迷信武力，繼續侵擾，長此以往，我陸海空軍在忍無可忍及全國人民之支持下，憑藉長江天嶄，必將羣起殲滅共軍之進犯，今後究竟誰是好戰，誰願誠意言和平，全國人民當可根據事實，從事正義的評判。</p>

<h3>上海市民當心火災</h3>
<p>殘臘將盡，冬防吃緊，上海市社會的安全與秩序的安定，已為當局和民間最關心的問題。社會秩序安定的維持，市警備當局已作各項措施，至社會安全的保陣，則有賴當局和民間共同努力。以最近一月來的事實來說，上海市民的生命財產，工商業的物資器材，公私的建築設備，最感受安全威脅的，除了戰亂的蔓延這個因素以外，要算火災的威脅了。此乃都市社會嚴重的問題，而來日方長，禍福難卜，我們不能不向市當局和市民，作「當心火災」的緊急呼聲。</p>
<p>上海為東方的大都市，我國東南最大的吞吐港，貨殖往來，工商繁榮，人口集中近六百萬，房屋居住密集，加以建築不良，消防窳敗，以及一般人自治精神，責任觀念的缺乏，這對於公共福利的推行，公共安全的維護，障礙和困難是很多的。前年春武定路的大火，延燒至十三小時，半條馬路的房屋物產，悉化灰燼；南潯路茂昌堆棧的大火，燃燒至三十小時，行總大批物資，付之一炬，均為上海空前的大火災，公私的損失，市民的創痛，迄今依然存在，難予補償。過去這兩次大火災，為消防行政的考勝，幷且是市民缺少道德觀念，建築設備尙欠合理的考騐。經過如此重大創傷之後，積極消防與消極消防，年來有了很大的改良，祇是一般市民缺乏戒懼心理，不愼起居，以致時有火警發生，愈益增加社會不安定的因素。</p>
<p>以本年一月的事實來說，六日閘北中興路止園路一塲大火，焚燬住戶五六百家；八日南市多稼路新街一塲大火，焚燬住戶二百餘家；十二日閘北廣肇路發生火災，罹難住戶約一千餘家；這些被燬住戶，多係貧苦市民，以棚木為家，巨災之後即露宿街頭，饑寒交迫，困苦萬狀，頓成椿嚴軍的社會問題。南市閘北火災的慘痛敎訓，毫未喚起市民的警覺，因是一月以來，日有火災發生，廿五日一天之中，竟有六處火災發生，其對於社會安全的威脅，及為社會增加貧窮問題，當是一椿値得注意的事。現在時局不靖，社會紛亂，一般市民為了社會安全和自身安全，都應養成戒懼心理，藉以减少或消滅火災的發生。大都市的生活，是一種共同的生活，為了公共福利的推行，為了公共安全的維護，非常時期當心火災，當是都市共同生活中的人羣中應持的一種非常態度。</p>
<p>現在時令舊歲，用火取暖，點放花爆，在行為上均易發生更多的火災，實不可不愼！凡事豫則立，不豫則廢，為了上海市民生命財產的安全，工商業物資器材的安全，甚且為了社會秩序的安定，我們都希望當局和市民，共同豫謀火災之發生。要之，當心火災，人人有責，必須人人警惕，人人負責，才能化火害為祥和，去禍息於無形。在市當局方面，除了積極充實消防設備，改良消防人員待遇，喚起消防人員責任感外，幷需要實行戶口安全的檢查，應限制使用火油，禁止點放花爆，必要時作人口疏散，亦屬必要。在市民方面，希望人人有責任感，養成自治精神。非常時期的應變熊度，需要培植自治精神，進而發皇為都市社會共同生活的精神。我們相信一十室之內必有忠信」，上海市民不乏明智之人，如果人人能抱謹愼心理，父以敎子，夫以敎妻，主婦以敎僕傭，家家為公共安全着想，戶戶為家庭利益着想，處處小心，時時警惕，在心理上行為上，從事防止火災，則火災自可防止於未燃了。</p>
<h3>潘公展談和平前途　能否實現擊於中共一念</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕記者昨訪市參議會潘議長公展，詢其對於和談前途之觀感及上海局部和平之看法。潘議長當答稱：和平為人民所渴望，亦為政府所蔪求，已無疑義。但和平究為雙方之事，能否實現，確已繫於中共之一念。蔣總統毅然以引退謀和，李代總統更願就毛澤東先生之八項條件商談，並先作釋放政治犯等種種誠意表示，當然均全為人民着想，惟中共近日廣播，尙未指定代表及地點，且一再擴充其「戰犯」名單，不知中共究將與誰談和？例如本人，站在滬市參議會立塲，與北平市參議會許惠東議長相同，幾無日不代人民哀求和平，而兩人均榮膺中共所賜「戰犯」之嘉名，不知中共方面主持戰爭諸公，在人民面前是否亦將稱為「戰犯」？深惜中共此種廣播，或將關閉和平之門，總之今日吾人切懇雙方純粹為减少人民痛苦設想，摒除成見相忍相讓，罷戰謀和絕不能着一毫「我」相，尤不可有傲慢習氣，方能期其有成。猶憶卅五年冬，國共商談時，國民黨不但從未提出所謂「戰犯」名單以阻塞和平之門，且歡迎毛澤東先生等到陪都晤商，今之視昔能無感慨！至於和戰原是整個問題，假使因中共之節節進迫，戰火愈復蔓延，則是非曲直更可瞭然，吾上海市民愛和平，同時亦愛自由，愛正義，大義所在，自由所關，一二八與八一三之往事記憶猶新，吾人深願中共諸君同為中國人民，苟不欲使中國元氣大傷，願為人民保留一綫生機者，則其南下部隊在長江北岸當能懸崖勒馬，適可而止，就地停戰，以利和談之重開，否則「覆巢之下寗有完卵」？局部和平恐亦徒成黃粱一夢，但無論如何，敢信上海市民必願出其全力，以爭取眞正的，民主的，永久的和平也。</p>

<h3>美衆院軍委會聽取　世界軍事局勢報告　陸長羅雅爾強調美應有備無患</h3>

<h3>車轔轔　馬蕭蕭　鎭江一瞥</h3>
<p>— 本報記者和香林　陳鍾麟</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿五日訊〕在舉國和談接近聲中，江蘇省會所在地之鎭江，已面臨最前綫，一江之隔的蘇北重鎭揚州，已在駐軍有計劃的轉移下，於廿四日夜十時撤完。到記者寫稿時止，尙有最後一部份軍政機關人員絡繹渡江南來。廿五日晨起，鎭江至六圩間的輪渡也吿中斷，江邊碼頭，塞滿了來自揚州·泰縣·高郵的成千難民，所幸他們沒有遭遇到砲火的摧殘，心情之濃厚的渴望着和平早日實現，重返家園。江邊的東頭與西頭，車轔轔，馬蕭蕭，裝甲車不斷的來往，充滿一片戰時狀態。各馬路口沙包堆積，工兵們正加緊的赶築防禦工事，許多敏感的鎮江人這樣悠閑的說：這些都是和平的外圍，看樣子，雙方都不會打下去了。</p>
<p>風帆滿載難民</p>
<p>江流中突出一座焦山寺，一向隱逸在翛然的世界裏，於今已不同於往昔了，四周逡巡的，是海軍江防的巡艦和無數的砲艇，而不是游客的畫舫。一向慣於水面生涯的漁舟，更失却了憑籍焦山的生活力量，現在，只是一片片風帆，載着那浪跡天涯的難民羣，由這江流湍急的山下過去，向那比較安全的江面靠岸。</p>
<p>掃空拍賣標幟</p>
<p>舊曆年，在鎭江人們心底深處，有極深的榮迥，商人們正在結算盈虧，家家戶戶，都為這個結束的歲尾與迎接來年的新春，焦慮和籌劃。馬路上賣年糕，鞭砲，門神，春聯，以及其他有關年節備用的什物，滿街觸目皆是。商店裏仿照京滬，也高懸着「掃空大拍賣」，减價的標幟，兜攬生意，食品舖中，滿掛着「金華火腿」，「廣東香腸」，「南京板鴨」，各式各樣的臘味。在這舊曆年節中小孩子們玩的要貨，也陳設在街頭，只是價錢高貴，收入微薄的省縣級公敎人員，他和他的孩子們也不過是「臨淵羨魚」，欣賞一番了事。從昨天起，街頭巷尾又多了新奇的點綴，「賣揚州花哪」，「賣揚州花哪」，不由的令人有「隔江猶賣揚州花」之感喟。一向安居在溫暖的江南人們的心坎裏，激盪着異樣的心情。</p>
<p>列車空前忙碌</p>
<p>這半個月來，京滬間列車，因為南京各機關的大疏散，造成了空前絕後的忙碌，擁擠。當每次車由南京開往上海停靠鎭江站時，車內已是滿坑滿谷，站立月台橋上之大批候車旅客，及單帮客，均紛紛冒險由天橋上爭先躍至車頂，或攀登車廂玻窗而進，致遭墜車跌傷或慘死者，時有所聞。又近日來，因軍運頻繁，列車時有延誤，滬地之申·新·大公等報，亦常脫班到鎭。甚望京滬路當局，速為設法調度車輛行次，以策行旅之安全。</p>
<p>丁治磐勗同人</p>
<p>省屬各廳處公敎人員，現正聯合要求省府援照中央的例子，發下遣散費，以作安家打算。丁治磐主席，廿四日在紀念週上曾對同仁這樣說：「處此國家局勢動盪之際，我們必須自己安定，不自相驚擾，方能使社會安定。和平為人人所希望，當聽候中央決定。至於同仁生活問題，時刻關懷，一月份薪餉已提前發放，二月份薪金也正撥墊，務望精神團結，共體時艱」。最後丁氏並以「正其誼不謀其利」，「明其道不計其功」相勗。</p>
<p>江防的第一綫</p>
<p>〔又二十六日訊〕自廿四夜揚州棄守後，鎭江已臨長江邊防之第一棧。廿五日一天內，此間與對江六圩輪渡加班來往撤渡揚州南退之軍隊與難民，而共軍亦僅南進至施家橋，（距揚城南十一華里）一天內麕集於六圩之軍民，均已安全抵達鎭江。自廿六日起，鎭六（圩）輪渡乃宣吿中斷。此次由揚南撤之軍民估計在兩萬人以上，鎭江江邊一帶難民羣躑躅街頭，益增此間急景凋年中之凄其景象。</p>
<p>春節期盼佳訊</p>
<p>對江據點放棄之後，海軍配合江南陸地防守部隊執行江防任務，江防砲艇已正密切注視江北共軍行動。此間雖面臨前綫，但市民均以沉靜之心情注視今後時局之發展，尤盼春節帶來和平佳訊。此問五家報紙春節休刊期中，將以聯合版逐日供給市民消息。省府遷動已準備就緒，各廳處局十分之七人負先行離鎭，眷屬隨同撤退，由省府發給免費乘車票，撤退人員及眷屬均待丁主席之命令，隨時登車離鎭，丁氏則率領十分之三人員暫時駐鎭留守。</p>
<p>煤斤足供需用</p>
<p>此間因煤斤缺乏，水電廠實行分區停電，已歷兩月，現屆春節，又値時局動盪期中，水電供應尤不可缺，省府廿五日實行緊急措施，徵用過境煤斤，以維持省會水電供應，計扣留一千七百噸，由鎭江水電廠以每噸三千五百元給價。此項煤斤足供水電廠一個月之用，春節期間，全市水電決無停頓之虞。</p>

<h3>Li Zongren Telephones Mao Zedong Urging Him to Send Representatives to Start Negotiations; Explains That Today's Matter is Not About the Honor or Disgrace of One Party or One Person; Hopes for Swift Cessation of Hostilities, Bringing About Peace and Harmony</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Acting President Li telegraphed Mao Zedong on the 27th, urging him to send representatives to agree on a location and begin peace talks. The original telegram read: "Brother Runzhi: Since the breakdown of the Political Consultative Conference and following the eight years of war against foreign aggression, the civil war has lasted for more than three years. The nation's vitality is greatly damaged, and the people suffer immensely. Ceasing hostilities and seeking peace has become the unanimous call of the nation today. Therefore, from the day I took office, I resolved to use the utmost sincerity and make the greatest efforts to promote the realization of peace. The statement I issued on the 22nd and the telegrams I sent to Mr. Ren Chao, Mr. Hengshan, Mr. Bojun, and Mr. Dongshen, I believe have all been received. The country is now in such a state of ruin, and the people are suffering so deeply. The destruction of fields and cities, the deaths and injuries of innocent people, are countless. Wives separated from husbands, children separated from parents, crying from hunger and cold, are everywhere. All this is caused by the war. In the past, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, under the leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, jointly devoted themselves to the Chinese revolution. Unfortunately, due to differences in political views, internal strife arose, causing such a catastrophe for the country and the people. Looking back on the past, how can we not feel heartbroken? If we truly believe that the purpose of the revolution is to increase the interests of the people and the nation, and that the motivation of the revolution is based on the will of the majority of the people, then no matter how different the propositions and political views of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party may be, in today's situation, there is absolutely no reason to continue resorting to force, killing each other, to increase the suffering of the people and the nation. There is no other way to follow except to follow the national will, cease hostilities and seek peace, and engage in a political solution. Otherwise, our crimes will truly be unpardonable even if we die a hundred times. In the past, you, sir, have repeatedly declared your willingness to seek a peaceful solution. The current government has expressed its sincerity for peace through words and actions. All the demands previously made by people from all walks of life across the country, such as the release of political prisoners, freedom of speech, and protection of people's freedom, are being gradually implemented. The facts are there for all to see; how can they be called false? I hope you, sir, will call upon your comrades in the Party to jointly and quickly promote peace talks, immediately dispatch representatives, agree on a location, and begin negotiations. If the war can be stopped for one day, thousands of national lives will be saved, and thousands of orphans and widows will be reduced. If we can all understand the difficulties of the time and meet each other with sincerity, everything can be resolved. The eight conditions proposed by your side, the government has recognized that they can be used as a basis for peace talks. All issues can be discussed and decided during the negotiations. Before the discussions between the two sides have even begun, to demand that the other party must first implement certain conditions, how can this be called peace talks? If past grievances and rights and wrongs are given too much importance, then revenge will beget revenge, and there will be no end to it. Alas, my compatriots, I fear there will be no hope. You, sir, and I will both become eternal sinners of the nation. Furthermore, your broadcasts have repeatedly stated that the government's advocacy of peace this time is a conspiracy of the government colluding with a certain country. This view is obviously derived from a certain prejudice. Since the War of Resistance against Japan, my foreign policy has always been based on being friendly to neighbors and treating them with kindness, without any favoritism. All that is helpful to the peaceful construction of our country should be closely cooperated with. In the future, we can only follow this principle to ensure peace in East Asia and the independence and autonomy of our country. You, sir, are wise and will certainly agree. In short, today's matter is not about the honor or disgrace of one party or one person, but about the lifeline of the nation and the life and death of the people. I personally have no selfish motives or concerns about gains or losses. If we can quickly eliminate the war and bring about peace and harmony, allowing me to relinquish my responsibilities early and return to my original position, it is what I pray for every moment. I sincerely express my intentions, hoping for your wise consideration and a reply. Your brother, Li Zongren, January 27th, Secret Seal of the Capital."</p>
<h3>Key Leaders of the Ministry of National Defense Hold Important Meeting; Zhang Zhizhong Flies to Wuhan This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Acting President Li convened a meeting of key leaders of the Ministry of National Defense at the Ministry of National Defense on the morning of the 27th. Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Tang Enbo, Zhou Zhirou, Gui Yongqing, and others attended. It is reported that important discussions were held. At noon, he also invited Legislative Yuan members Yin Shuxian, Huang Yuren, Qiu Changwei, and others to a banquet, during which they exchanged many opinions on the current situation, especially discussing the content of the CCP's broadcasts in recent days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The government's determination to sincerely seek peace has not been shaken by the CCP's broadcasts in recent days. People close to Acting President Li said that the Acting President still holds the attitude of doing his best and continues to work for peace. The government's pursuit of peace is with the utmost sincerity, so it is still quietly waiting for the CCP to send representatives and designate representatives so that peace work for the benefit of the people can be carried out immediately. However, according to the feelings obtained by our reporter from various parties throughout the day on the 27th, they all feel that the prospects for peace are dim due to the CCP's broadcasts, and some people have even expressed negative intentions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Zhang Zhizhong will fly back to the Northwest by special plane on the morning of the 28th. Li Pinsian will accompany him to Wuhan. Mr. Zhang may make a short stop in Wuhan and then fly directly to Lanzhou.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Shao Lizi told Chinese reporters that the government delegation is ready and can fly to Beiping at any time. There is much speculation here, with some saying that the delegation may plan to go to Beiping without waiting for the CCP's consent, but well-informed sources believe this news is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Professors Form People's Delegation to Fly to Beiping Tomorrow to Convey True Public Opinion and Promote Comprehensive Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The People's Peace Delegation, jointly formed by the China Peace Promotion Association and the National Policy Research Association of Professors from Various Universities in China, consisting of seven professors including Wu Yuhou, has borrowed transportation from the government and will travel to Beiping to appeal for peace. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has agreed to allocate a plane. In order to immediately save the people from the scourge of war, they will not spare their efforts and plan to fly to Beiping on the 29th (Lunar New Year's Day) to convey the true expectations of the people, so as to promote comprehensive peace. The original telegrams sent to Ye Jianying, Deng Baoshan, and Zhou Binglin are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Ye Jianying of the Beiping Joint Office, and forwarded to Mr. Mao Zedong: After eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the nation's vitality has been damaged. After three years of internal strife, the country's pulse is about to break. The people are suffering and urgently need peace. Our association has been running around and appealing for it for a month, which I believe you have seen. Recently, rumors from various parties indicate that the prospects for peace are turning dim, while the people's desire for peace is becoming more urgent. In order to convey the true public opinion, our association has specially organized a People's Peace Delegation, with a total of ten representatives and reporters. It will fly from Nanjing to Beiping at 10:00 a.m. on the 29th of this month, arriving around 2:00 p.m. on the same day. We respectfully hope that you will inform the security personnel and provide assistance. We look forward to it, and this telegram is sent in advance. Please note. China People's Peace Promotion Association, National Policy Research Association of Professors from Various Universities in China, respectfully. Printed on the 27th.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Deng Baoshan of the Beiping Joint Office, and forwarded to Mr. Fu Zuoyi: Recently, the prospects for peace talks have turned dim. In order to convey the true public opinion, our association has specially organized a People's Peace Delegation, consisting of seven members and three accompanying reporters. It will fly from Nanjing to Beiping at 10:00 a.m. on the 29th of this month. This telegram is sent in advance. We respectfully hope that you will inform the security personnel and provide assistance. We look forward to it. China People's Peace Promotion Association, National Policy Research Association of Professors from Various Universities in China, respectfully. Printed on January 27th.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Zhou Binglin of the Faculty of Law of Peking University, and forwarded to professors from various universities in Beiping, newspaper offices, and people's organizations: As the civil war continues, the prospects for peace are dim. The wealthy officials have all fled far away, and the victims will inevitably be innocent civilians. In order to convey the true public opinion, our association has specially organized a People's Peace Delegation, with a total of about ten members and reporters. It will fly from Nanjing to Beiping at 10:00 a.m. on the 29th of this month. We will seek a good meeting at that time to jointly plan for comprehensive peace. This telegram is sent in advance. Please note. China People's Peace Promotion Association, National Policy Research Association of Professors from Various Universities in China, respectfully. Printed on January 27th.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Orders Minister to Remain in Nanjing and Adopt a Wait-and-See Policy; Clark Leads a Small Group of Staff to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] It is now confirmed tonight that the U.S. State Department has instructed U.S. Ambassador to China Stuart, Leiden to continue to stay in Beijing and adopt a "wait-and-see" policy, while Minister-Counselor Clark leads a small group of staff to move to Guangzhou with the Chinese government. It is expected that this move by the U.S. will have a decisive impact on the actions of diplomatic envoys from various Western countries here. Envoys from the North Atlantic Group countries have held three meetings in the past eighteen hours to discuss whether to move south. Most embassies are still waiting for instructions from their governments to act. As for the Soviet Embassy and the embassies of Czech and Poland, they will abide by the provisions of their credentials and move south with the government.</p>
<h3>Tong Guanxian Entertains Legislators in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., he held a tea party at the New Life Club to entertain more than 70 legislators in Shanghai. Mr. Tong delivered a speech first, saying that the purpose of the tea party was to report on the government's relocation situation. The Executive Yuan has now decided to work in Guangzhou on February 5th. The Legislative Yuan plenary session was originally scheduled to be held on February 1st, but due to the current situation, it is difficult to hold a meeting in Nanjing, so it has been decided to reconvene in Guangzhou in mid-February. It is now necessary to make relocation preparations immediately. Vice President Liu Jianqun is responsible for finding a venue in Guangzhou. The travel expenses for legislators to go to Guangzhou for the meeting have been approved by the Executive Yuan and will be paid by the government. Most of the Legislative Yuan staff have voluntarily dispersed, and there are less than 100 people left in Nanjing to work. Chen Guyuan and Fang Zhichao then spoke, advocating that the Legislative Yuan should find a place near Nanjing and Shanghai to reconvene in order to promote the realization of peace and should not move south. Zhang Qingzhen and others believed that the Legislative Yuan should be located in the capital, and that if it does not move, it is easy to breed abuses. However, they emphasized that after moving to Guangzhou, there should be a thorough review of all the resolutions and suggestions made by the Legislative Yuan in the past, whether they have all been accepted and implemented by the government, and criticized the long delay in adjusting the treatment of public school teachers and staff, the changing policies on exchange deposits, and the failure of local authorities to release detained students. They all advocated that the Legislative Yuan should fully play its role in the future. Mr. Tong then replied: The Legislative and Executive Yuans have a close relationship, so the Legislative Yuan must move. The current problem is how to solve the various relocation difficulties so that the meeting can be held in Guangzhou as scheduled in February. The Legislative Yuan has decided to set up offices in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Guilin to handle relocation matters. In Shanghai, Mr. Ma Shuli is responsible for liaison and registration. The meeting then adjourned at 6:00 p.m. It is also learned that Mr. Tong is scheduled to return to Nanjing today.</p>
<h3>30 U.S.-Supplied Fighter Planes Arrive in Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 27th] About 30 Mustang fighter planes were shipped from the United States three days ago and unloaded at Keelung Port.

<h3>Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng Arrive in Shanghai to Fly to Guangzhou in a Few Days to Preside Over the Affairs of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] After the government decided to move the capital, in addition to the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan working in Guangzhou on the 5th of next month, the heads of the various ministries and commissions are scheduled to go to Guangzhou starting on the 1st. Executive Yuan President Sun Ke and Vice President Wu Tiecheng flew to Shanghai on the 27th and can transfer to Guangzhou immediately.

<h3>Part of U.S. Marine Corps in China to Withdraw Soon; Plan to Train National Army Announced to End</h3>
<p>[United Press, Our City News] U.S. Western Pacific Naval Commander Badger told reporters on the 27th that a portion of the U.S. Marine Corps will withdraw from China soon, but plans to retain sufficient strength to deal with any emergencies. The Marine Corps currently stationed in China has about 3,000 in Qingdao and 600 in Shanghai, which exceeds the need. Part of the Qingdao Marine Corps is being moved from shore barracks to warships. However, it is pointless to keep too many people on the ships, and those who are not needed are better off being sent to Guam and other places. Mr. Badger did not disclose how many Marine Corps stationed in China will be reduced or whether it will affect the Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, but he believes that the Marine Corps staying on ships does not violate the sovereignty of the host country according to international law. The U.S. policy of maintaining sufficient troops in China to prevent riots and protect U.S. citizens and other foreigners will not change. Mr. Badger hopes that the handover of various places in China will be as peaceful as Beiping. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps do not participate in the Chinese civil war and will strictly abide by the non-interference policy. When asked what would happen if the Communist Party demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. Navy after taking control of China, Mr. Badger replied that he might withdraw, but this should be decided by the government. He only knows how to follow orders and it depends on the need to prevent riots and protect overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>[United Press, Pearl Harbor, 26th] The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced today that the four destroyers "Duncan," "Perkins," "Rodgers," and "Duke" sailed to Qingdao yesterday to serve in the Western Pacific Fleet. This move is "routine redeployment in the area."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 27th] The United States has officially terminated its military training program for Nationalist China. This move can remove another obstacle on the road to peace between the KMT and the Communists. The CCP had accused a U.S. military group of actively assisting the government in combat, which the United States denied. Except for a few U.S. military personnel, they all took a ship to Japan and returned to the United States on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Communist Representatives for Beiping Joint Office Determined; Minor Problems Remain Regarding National Army Moving Outside the City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] The candidates for the Communist representatives for the Beiping Joint Office have been determined to be Ye Jianying, Xu Bing, Tao Zhu, and Rong Shihe. It is reported that some of them have entered the city, but the names are unknown. The personal representatives left behind by Vice President Li and Bai Chongxi are still in Beiping working for comprehensive peace, but the details of their activities are unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] The Communist army has not yet entered the city, and a considerable number of National Army troops are still stationed in the city. Street posts are densely distributed, and prices in the city are soaring. The old capital is in a desolate state at the end of the year, and the tension cannot be concealed in the midst of peace. It is heard that there are still minor problems regarding the National Army moving outside the city, which are waiting for the two sides to discuss and decide. It is unlikely that the Communist army will enter the city before the Spring Festival.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 27th] The Communist Party is still operating behind the scenes. All public institutions, such as public utilities and telecommunications, are managed by the original government personnel, making it difficult to believe that Beiping has been ruled by the Communist Party. It is reported that the Communist Party officials in charge announced that anyone who attempts to take over the above-mentioned institutions without permission will be punished. However, once the transition period is over, the Communist Party will openly manage Beiping. Peking University students are preparing to hold a large-scale parade to celebrate the arrival of the Liberation Army and to break free from the spiritual prison. Thirty-two professors from Peking University and Normal University also jointly issued a declaration supporting the eight conditions proposed by Mao Zedong as the only basis for true peace.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Automatically Withdraws Northward; National Army Enters Yangzhou City; Yizheng Has Not Been Abandoned and Was Relieved Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 27th] A company of the 13th Column of the Communist Army's Yi Department, which had invaded Yangzhou City, automatically withdrew northward from Bianyi Gate at 9:00 a.m. on the 27th. The 59th Division of the 4th Army, Wang Zuohua's Department, stationed in Shijiaqiao, heard the news and immediately advanced towards Yangzhou, entering the city safely without encountering any resistance along the way. It is heard that another unit of the National Army has advanced towards Taixian from Longwokou on the Zhen (Jiang) Xu (Liu Xu) line. At this moment, the National Army is adding elite troops to cross the Yangtze River north to work overnight. Zhou Delin, the magistrate of Jiangdu County who was left in Guazhou waiting for orders, is scheduled to lead the staff to Yangzhou on the 28th. The Zhen (Jiang) Wei (Liu Wei) Zhen (Jiang) Kou (Bank) ferry will also be restored. At present, 200,000 citizens of Zhenjiang are welcoming the New Year with a happy mood. Also: Yizheng was relieved on the morning of the 27th after reinforcements arrived (the previous report of withdrawal was inaccurate), and the county town is still firmly defended by the stationed troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 27th] The situation north of the Yangtze River is completely quiet today. In Jingjiang, our powerful troops have been reinforced, and the situation is excellent. We have also reinforced the port area. We have reinforced Liuxu and Guazhou twice yesterday and today. At 4:00 p.m. this afternoon, we advanced towards Shijiaqiao to search for the local Communists. There has been no activity in Yizheng today. In general, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has no formal main force, has extremely poor equipment, and has no offensive capability.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Jingjiang City, across the river from Wangyin, was invaded by more than a thousand Communist troops before dawn on the 26th. Also, the Communist army stationed in Yangzhou is reported to be the Gaoyang Independent Regiment of Gu Weihang's department. The connection with Guazhou Gudutou, south of Yangzhou, was also interrupted starting on the 26th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The National Army, from Chongming in the east to Wuhu in the west of the southern bank of the Yangtze River, has not only taken up its positions and completed the deployment, but also drawn elite troops, such as paratroopers, to complete the organization of mobile divisions under the CCP's delayed peace talks and accelerated military offensive. These mobile divisions are transported by ten trucks, and each soldier is a light machine gunner, so that if a small group of the Communist army steals across any part of the long Yangtze River defense line, they can quickly rush to annihilate them. In addition, most of the Yangtze River civilian ships have been summoned to the south bank. It is reported that although Chen Yi has deployed troops north of the Yangtze River, he is still waiting for Lin Biao's troops to move south and reinforce before launching a large-scale crossing of the river.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Puzhen, 27th] The KMT and Communist armies on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway are still in a stalemate between Dongge, Xige, and Wuyi. On the 27th, there were only local small contacts all day long. The Communist army's front-line forces are Chen Yi's 12th and New 1st Columns, the former stationed on the railway side and east of the railway, and the latter stationed in Quanjiao and its northern Shizilu. Because the National Army controls a strong force of four armies in the two Pu areas, the military judges that people in the capital may not have to replace firecrackers with artillery fire to embellish this upcoming Lunar New Year. [Our Newspaper, Puzhen, 27th] It is reported that about 3,000 local Communists have sneaked into Kongcheng, east of Tongcheng in central Anhui, and are advancing towards Tongcheng to invade and harass.</p>
<h3>If the Communist Army Continues to Attack, the National Army is Determined to Resist in Self-Defense; Deng Wenyi Speaks at a Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Ministry of National Defense Spokesman Deng Wenyi said at a press conference on the afternoon of the 27th that since the government called for peace, the National Army has adopted a defensive strategy in order to comply with the government's decision. The National Army has now withdrawn to the Weijiang defense line, but the Communist Army is still attacking. For self-defense, the National Army is determined to resist on the Yangtze River defense line. At present, ten columns of the Communist Army have been found concentrated in northern Jiangsu and on both sides of the Jinpu Line. About four columns are in the Taixian and Yangzhou area, which is the main force of Shanxi and Henan. There are still six columns on the Jinpu front and on both sides, but each column has no more than 10,000 people, totaling about 200,000 people. The National Army has more than 300,000 people, plus the cooperation of the navy and air force. It is believed that if the Communist Army invades, it will suffer a serious blow. According to Mr. Deng, the Communist Army on the Jinpu front has now reached Wuyi, 30 miles north of Puzhen. It is expected that the Communist Army may launch an offensive within the next week.</p>
<h3>Defense Ministry Announces One Week of War Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of National Defense today announced the war situation for the week from January 20th to 26th as follows: For the past week, in order to comply with the Executive Yuan's decision for an unconditional ceasefire and to promote the early realization of peace, which is the unanimous desire of the entire nation, the national army in various regions has proactively withdrawn from certain areas to show sincerity for peace. Therefore, except for a few areas where the communist army invaded and the national army had small-scale resistance and outpost contact, it was generally peaceful. However, some communist troops constantly attacked the national army. After repeated tolerance, the national army also counterattacked. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Jianghuai Area: Disregarding the national people's ardent desire for peace, the communist army has been pressing southward day after day, and has approached the north bank of the Yangtze River in several places. In order to comply with the government's decision and to show sincere intent for peace negotiations, the national army on the Jinpu Railway line voluntarily withdrew from Bengbu on the 19th, Chuxian on the 23rd, the national army in northern Jiangsu withdrew from Rugao on the 22nd, Yangzhou on the 24th, the national army in northern Anhui withdrew from Hefei on the 21st, Yexian on the 24th, and tolerated the communist army in areas such as Mingguang, Jiashan, Zhangbaling, Quanjiao, and Taixian in northern Jiangsu. The vanguard of the communist army under Chen Yi's 12th Column and the 34th Brigade of the Jianghuai Independent Brigade, moving south along the Jinpu Railway line, had contact with the national army. The follow-up troops are Chen Yi's nine columns, four of which have reached the counties of Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Liuhe, and Tianchang. The other five columns are also moving south along the Jinpu Railway line, reaching the vicinity of Yuxian. Although the communist army is pressing hard, appearing to launch a larger offensive soon, its strength is limited. Each column has only over ten thousand men. Moreover, our Yangtze River defense has been tightly deployed. Therefore, if the communist army attempts to cross the Yangtze River by stealth, it will be difficult to succeed. The national army now secures several important forward bases on the north bank of the Yangtze River, such as Taixian, Yangzhou, Yizheng south of Yangzhou, and Jiangpu. If the Yangtze River defense war is unavoidable, the price the communist army pays will be heavier than the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign. The national army can achieve the effect of favorable timing, geographical advantages, and popular support, and the future of the war situation can be changed.</p>
<p>(2) North China Area: In order to shorten the war, achieve peace, and preserve the ancient capital of Beiping and its cultural relics, General Commander Fu Zuoyi issued a proclamation on the 22nd, announcing a ceasefire starting from 10:00 AM on the 22nd. Most of the national army in Beiping immediately followed the headquarters' instructions, successively withdrawing from the urban area and entering designated locations. A small part of the communist army has entered the urban area, and ceasefire will also be implemented in Suiyuan and Datong.</p>
<p>(3) Eastern Gansu Area: There are more than 1,600 communist troops in the Guyi area. On the 21st, the communist army continuously attacked the national army. For self-defense, our Eastern Gansu Corps immediately counterattacked. After only four hours of fierce fighting, the entire 21st Regiment of the communist army was annihilated. It is estimated that more than 700 communist troops were killed and more than 400 were captured alive. The victory in Eastern Gansu proves that if the communist army remains obsessed with its course, it will inevitably suffer a fatal blow under the hatred of the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>(4) Northern Jiangsu Area: The national army is currently holding the line from south of Yangzhou to Yizheng. On the 22nd night, a part of the communist army attacked Yizheng. The battle continued until the evening of the 23rd, when the defending troops repelled the invading communist army. In the Liuhe area, more than 2,000 communist troops attacked on the 22nd night. The defending troops immediately launched a fierce counterattack, and the war is still continuing nearby.</p>
<p>In summary, given the facts of the past month and the recent week, the communist army has no sincere intention for peace, still believes in force, and continues to harass. If this continues, with the support of the army, navy, and air force, and the support of the people of the whole country, relying on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, we will surely rise up and annihilate the communist army's invasion. In the future, who is a warmonger and who sincerely wants peace talks, the people of the whole country can make a righteous judgment based on the facts.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Citizens Beware of Fire</h3>
<p>As the end of the year approaches and winter fire prevention becomes crucial, the safety and order of Shanghai society, as well as the stability of its society, have become the most concerning issues for both the authorities and the people. While the maintenance of social order is being addressed by the municipal police authorities with various measures, ensuring social safety relies on the joint efforts of the authorities and the people. Considering the facts of the past month, the most significant threat to the lives and properties of Shanghai citizens, the materials and equipment of industries and businesses, and the public and private building facilities, aside from the spread of war, is the threat of fire. This is a serious problem for urban society, and as the days ahead are long and fortune is unpredictable, we must urgently call on the municipal authorities and the citizens to "Beware of Fire."</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major city in the East and the largest port of import and export in Southeast China. Commerce and industry are prosperous, and the population is concentrated at nearly six million. Housing is densely packed, buildings are poorly constructed, fire protection is inadequate, and the general public lacks a spirit of self-governance and a sense of responsibility. This poses many obstacles and difficulties to the promotion of public welfare and the maintenance of public safety. The major fire on Wuding Road in the spring of the year before last burned for thirteen hours, turning the houses and properties on half a street into ashes. The major fire in the Maochang warehouse on Nanxun Road burned for thirty hours, destroying a large amount of supplies from the Executive Yuan for Relief and Rehabilitation Affairs. These were unprecedented major fires in Shanghai. The public and private losses, and the trauma of the citizens, still exist and are difficult to compensate for. These two major fires in the past served as a test of fire protection administration, and also a test of the citizens' lack of moral awareness and the lack of reasonable building facilities. After such major traumas, active and passive fire prevention have greatly improved in recent years, but the general public lacks a sense of vigilance and is careless in their daily lives, resulting in frequent fire alarms, which further increases the factors of social instability.</p>
<p>Considering the facts of this January, a major fire on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei on the 6th destroyed five to six hundred households; a major fire on Duojia Road, Nanshi on the 8th destroyed more than two hundred households; a fire occurred on Guangzhao Road, Zhabei on the 12th, claiming the lives of approximately one thousand households. Most of these destroyed households are poor citizens who live in makeshift shelters. After the disaster, they are exposed on the streets, suffering from hunger and cold, and in extreme distress, turning into a severe social problem. The painful lessons of the fires in Nanshi and Zhabei have not awakened the vigilance of the citizens. As a result, there have been fires every day since January. On the 25th alone, there were six fires, which threatened social safety and increased the poverty problem, which is a matter worthy of attention. Now that the situation is unstable and society is chaotic, the general public should cultivate a sense of vigilance for social safety and personal safety, in order to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of fires. Life in a big city is a common life. For the promotion of public welfare and the maintenance of public safety, being careful about fire in extraordinary times should be an extraordinary attitude held by the people in the common life of the city.</p>
<p>Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, using fire for heating and setting off firecrackers can easily cause more fires, so caution is essential! Preparation prevents problems; lack of preparation causes failure. For the safety of Shanghai citizens' lives and properties, the safety of industrial and commercial materials and equipment, and even for the stability of social order, we hope that the authorities and the people will jointly plan to prevent the occurrence of fires. In short, being careful about fire is everyone's responsibility. Everyone must be vigilant and responsible to turn fire hazards into harmony and eliminate disasters in the invisible. On the part of the municipal authorities, in addition to actively replenishing fire protection equipment, improving the treatment of fire protection personnel, and arousing the sense of responsibility of fire protection personnel, it is also necessary to implement household safety inspections, restrict the use of kerosene, prohibit setting off firecrackers, and, if necessary, evacuate the population. On the part of the citizens, it is hoped that everyone will have a sense of responsibility and cultivate a spirit of self-governance. The ability to respond in extraordinary times requires cultivating a spirit of self-governance, which can then be developed into a spirit of common life in urban society. We believe that "there must be loyal and trustworthy people within ten households." Shanghai citizens are not lacking in wisdom. If everyone can maintain a cautious attitude, fathers teach their sons, husbands teach their wives, and housewives teach their servants, with every family thinking about public safety, and every household thinking about family interests, being careful everywhere, and being vigilant at all times, and engaging in fire prevention in psychology and behavior, then fire can be prevented before it ignites.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan Talks About the Future of Peace: Whether It Can Be Realized Depends on the Thoughts of the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday, a reporter visited Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Council to inquire about his views on the future of peace talks and the possibility of local peace in Shanghai. Speaker Pan replied: Peace is desired by the people and sought by the government, which is beyond doubt. However, peace is a matter for both sides, and whether it can be realized truly depends on the thoughts of the Chinese Communists. President Chiang resigned resolutely to seek peace, and Acting President Li is even willing to discuss Mr. Mao Zedong's eight conditions and has first made various sincere gestures such as releasing political prisoners. Naturally, all are for the sake of the people. However, the Chinese Communists have recently broadcasted that they have not yet designated representatives and locations, and have repeatedly expanded their list of "war criminals." It is unknown who the Chinese Communists will negotiate peace with? For example, myself, standing in the position of the Shanghai Municipal Council, am the same as Speaker Xu Huidong of the Beiping Municipal Council. Almost every day we beg for peace on behalf of the people, but both of us have been honored with the title of "war criminal" by the Chinese Communists. I wonder if the generals in charge of the war on the side of the Chinese Communists will also be called "war criminals" in front of the people? It is deeply regrettable that this kind of broadcast by the Chinese Communists may close the door to peace. In short, today we sincerely hope that both sides will purely consider reducing the suffering of the people, put aside prejudices, and tolerate each other. Ceasefire and seek peace must not involve a single "I" thought, and there must be no arrogance, only then can we hope for success. I still remember that when the Kuomintang and the Communist Party negotiated in the winter of 1946, the Kuomintang not only never put forward a so-called list of "war criminals" to block the door to peace, but also welcomed Mr. Mao Zedong and others to visit the capital for consultations. How can we not feel emotional when we look at the past! As for war and peace, it is originally a whole question. If the flames of war continue to spread due to the Chinese Communist's continuous advance, then right and wrong will be even clearer. We Shanghai citizens love peace, but also love freedom and justice. Where the great righteousness lies and freedom is concerned, the past events of January 28th and August 13th are still fresh in our minds. We sincerely hope that the gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party, as fellow Chinese people, if they do not want to greatly damage China's vitality and are willing to preserve a glimmer of hope for the people, then their southward troops on the north bank of the Yangtze River should be able to rein in their horses and stop at the right time, cease fighting on the spot, in order to facilitate the reopening of peace talks. Otherwise, "when the nest is overturned, will there be any intact eggs"? Local peace may also become a dream. But no matter what, I dare to believe that Shanghai citizens will be willing to do their best to strive for genuine, democratic, and lasting peace.</p>

Mr. Zhang is an honest official, and the family's livelihood depends entirely on Mr. Zhang's salary. At a time when prices are skyrocketing, Mr. Zhang only remits several thousand yuan for household expenses each month, which is not enough to cover expenses. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, Mrs. Zhang is sighing with her face to the ceiling. The family's life is far from being like that of a middle-class family, which is a world of difference compared to the lives of the families of high-ranking officials who have flown to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States, causing people to sigh in dismay.</p>

<h3>US House Military Committee Hears Report on World Military Situation, Secretary of the Army Royall Emphasizes US Should Be Prepared</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Washington, 27th Broadcast: The US House Armed Services Committee today reviewed the government's request to determine the number of army personnel and expand the air force to seventy groups. Secretary of the Army Royall attended the briefing and declared: "According to our estimates, war is unlikely to occur in the near future, but at least the possibility of war still exists. We should take appropriate measures to be prepared."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The highest-ranking military leaders of the government presented an overview of the world military situation to the House Armed Services Committee on the 26th. They also analyzed President Truman's defense request for the 1950 fiscal year, including the proposed air force reduction. Committee Chairman Vinson said that this would waste a lot of money and could endanger national security. This general report was presented by Secretary of Defense Forrestal and the responsible generals of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Retired General Eisenhower also attended as Forrestal's special advisor.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal reiterated his opinion to the House Military Committee on the night of the 26th that there is no immediate danger of war. But he also said that in the long run, the danger of war is difficult to eliminate. Forrestal declared that the peacetime organization of the Soviet Red Army and the tense international situation are justified reasons for the United States to propose a military budget of 15 billion US dollars for the construction of the army, navy, and air force. It is heard that Forrestal told the committee that the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union may continue for another ten years. It is also heard that Forrestal and Eisenhower both insisted on the special importance of the European region, and strongly advocated that the United States must not allow France and Italy to fall under the influence of the Soviet Union. It is reported that the US House Military Committee is now trying to eliminate the differences between the US Navy and Air Force regarding the request for more military appropriations.</p>
<h3>US Foreign Aid Program, Congressional Leaders Express Support</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Prominent senators on the 27th believed that the Soviet Union would challenge the United States' attempt to use the Marshall Plan as a promoter of Truman's massive foreign aid program. They claimed that the Soviet Union had just formed an "Eastern European Alliance" to resist the United States' efforts to revive foreign countries. These prominent senators also stated that Congress should support Truman's "world cooperation" plan and his request for 6.7 billion yuan in foreign aid appropriations. Congressional leaders said that from the US point of view, the Soviet Union's offensive timing was quite clever. It is reported that Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally and Senator Vandenberg are worried that the Soviet Union's "peace offensive" may deprive the government of votes on its foreign policy. Former Undersecretary of State Lovett also felt the same way. He said that if you want to be convincing, any peace gesture must come from actual performance. Regarding the Soviet Union's announcement of the establishment of the Economic Mutual Assistance Council with five Eastern European satellite countries, Senator Smith said that this move could prompt Congress to pass a huge foreign aid agenda.</p>
<h3>President Truman Talks to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Washington, 27th Broadcast: President Truman declared at a press conference today that he had not heard of the message from Philippine President Quirino to the United States.

<h3>British House of Commons Debates Holy Land Policy, Bevin Narrowly Wins Vote of Confidence, Government Prestige Weakened, Unease Revealed</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] Foreign Secretary Bevin told the House of Commons on the 26th that the United Kingdom was prepared to recognize Israel, but there should be no more war in Palestine. After that, he won a vote of confidence of 283 to 193. However, more than 50 Labor Party members abstained, which shocked the party.</p>
<p>Since the Labor Party came to power, the majority vote obtained on major issues has been the smallest this time, and the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party unanimously opposed it. Congressional sources believe that Bevin's weakened position is mostly due to the Labor Party's failure to provide significant support. Bevin tried his best to defend his Palestine policy, and told the House of Commons during the debate that the United Kingdom and the United States are conducting "frank and open" discussions on their basic policies in the Middle East. Conservative Party leader Churchill condemned Bevin for being prejudiced against Israel, which was extremely clumsy, and said that the United States and the Soviet Union were both opposed to the United Kingdom on the Palestine issue. Churchill forced a vote of confidence, which was the first vote of confidence that the Conservative Party had requested on foreign policy since the Labor government came to power in July 1945.</p>

Indonesian representative Bella claimed that the four-power proposal may not be acceptable to the Netherlands, and since this proposal does not stipulate a mechanism to strictly order the Netherlands to implement it, it is tantamount to leaving a "political time bomb."

He emphasized that one event is very important for Poland's economic future, that is, to try to change the bilateral agreements signed between Poland and certain countries into multilateral agreements. The spokesperson pointed out that Poland does not intend to restrict trade relations with Western countries, and the Polish government does not have to consult with the Economic Mutual Assistance Council before signing a trade agreement with another country. He continued, "The new agreement respects the sovereignty of the participating countries, and does not restrict them from only having economic interests with a certain power, which is different from the Marshall Plan."

<h3>Reorganization of Old Public Debt Treasury Bonds Approved and Implemented by Political Affairs Council</h3>
<p>According to news, the "Measures for the Ministry of Finance to promptly formulate reorganization measures for public debt treasury bonds issued by the previous government and submit them for approval and implementation" passed by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Council on the 16th of this month have been formulated by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Political Affairs Council on the 26th for approval and implementation. The principles are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The previously determined graded addition multiple for legal currency public bonds will be multiplied by 50 based on the previously determined multiple and cleared at once in advance. (2) Public bonds issued in 1949 to reorganize US dollar bonds and old foreign currency bonds will be converted into the above public bonds at face value. The principal and interest due in the future will be paid in US dollars.</p>
<p>The newly revised measures and the key points of the 1949 reorganization of US dollar public bonds are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Regarding the revised measures for the clearing of legal currency public bonds:</p>
<p>For the portion of the 17 types of legal currency public bonds issued in the past that had not yet matured and been repaid on August 20, 1948, the previous regulations stipulated that the addition multiple should be determined based on the market price of general legal currency public bonds on August 19, 1948, according to the order in which the bonds were issued, with the highest being 27,000 times and the lowest being 1,000 times, converted into gold yuan coupons, and cleared once in advance before the end of March 1949. It is now revised to increase the number of legal currency payable based on the face value of the old bonds, and then increase it to 1.35 million times for the highest and 50,000 times for the lowest, converted into gold yuan coupons, and cleared once in advance. The procedure must be completed within one month from the date of implementation of these measures in order to end it (attached revised multiple standard table).</p>
<p>2.  Regarding the revised measures for the exchange of foreign currency bonds for new bonds:</p>
<p>For the portion of the principal and interest of the four types of foreign currency bonds issued in the past, namely the 1938 Gold Public Bonds, the 1940 Construction Gold Public Bonds, the 1942 Allied Victory US Dollar Public Bonds, and the 1947 (US Dollar) Short-Term Treasury Bonds, that were actually sold and had not yet matured and been repaid on August 20, 1948, the previous regulations stipulated that they should be converted into the 1948 Reorganization Gold Yuan Public Bonds at the original exchange rate (i.e., 4 gold yuan per US dollar and 12 gold yuan per British pound). It is now revised to replace them with the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds at the original face value. All of them will be denominated in US dollars, and the principal and interest due in the future will be paid in US dollars. As for the two most recent interest coupons of the above four types of foreign currency bonds that were due after August 20, 1948, all of them will be cut off by the end of March 1949, and the amount of the deferred interest coupons will be calculated together with the outstanding principal of the bonds and replaced with the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds separately. The remaining fractions will be paid separately according to other measures in order to facilitate and clear the procedures.</p>

<h3>Austrian National Day Celebration - Ambassador Holds Reception</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday was Austria's National Day, and the Austrian Ambassador to China, Mr. Affes, held a grand reception at the Country Club on Nanjing West Road from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM, inviting leaders from all circles, both Chinese and foreign, in the city.

<h3>Elimination of Restrictions on Foreign Exchange Certificates Benefits Industrial Goods Imports</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The issue of the transfer of foreign exchange certificates has recently become a focus of research for industrial and commercial circles, and all those concerned about the economy are paying attention to it. Our reporter, considering that this issue is also related to the interests of the industrial sector, interviewed those in charge of import and export businesses yesterday. According to them, some people believe that the removal of restrictions on the transfer of foreign exchange certificates will increase costs for the industrial sector. In reality, the interests of the industrial sector are not entirely the same as those of the import and export sector. Currently, the country lacks foreign exchange, and all imports depend on the injection of foreign exchange from exports. Without exports, there would be no imports, and industrial raw materials would inevitably face a crisis. Therefore, both the industrial and import sectors deeply hope for the prosperity of exports. Because restrictions on the transfer price of foreign exchange certificates have led to a decline, verification has stalled, and imports have been hindered. Industrial raw materials will be insufficient. Therefore, the demand to eliminate restrictions on the transfer of foreign exchange certificates is a unified step that should be taken by both the industrial and import/export sectors.</p>

<p>The private Shanghai Women's Elementary School previously experienced internal disputes, and the Municipal Education Bureau, upon the order of the Municipal Government, sent personnel to take charge. Liu Xun, the chief of the responsible section, was assigned to temporarily take over and serve as acting principal.

After several summons by the court, the court concluded the hearing yesterday morning and declared Liu Xun not guilty. After the verdict, Mr. Liu stated that the school had been embroiled in long-term disputes, and he had been ordered to temporarily take over and found it very difficult to manage school affairs.

<h3>Citizen Uses Two Identity Cards - District Attorney's Office Files Indictment for Forgery</h3>

<h3>To Maintain the Value of Student Aid Grants - Entrusting Taishan Rice Store to Purchase 18 Dan of Rice</h3>

<h3>車轔轔　馬蕭蕭　A Glimpse of Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporters He Xianglin and Chen Zhonglin</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 25th] As the nationwide peace talks approach a climax, Zhenjiang, the capital of Jiangsu Province, is now facing the front lines. Yangzhou, an important town in northern Jiangsu across the river, has been completely evacuated by the garrison in a planned withdrawal by 10 PM on the 24th. As of this writing, the last of the military and government personnel are still crossing the river to the south in a continuous stream. The ferry service between Zhenjiang and Liuhe was suspended starting the morning of the 25th. The riverside docks are packed with thousands of refugees from Yangzhou, Taixian, and Gaoyou. Fortunately, they have not been ravaged by gunfire and fervently hope for an early realization of peace so that they can return home. On the east and west sides of the riverbank, the sound of vehicles rumble and horses neigh, armored vehicles constantly coming and going, creating a wartime atmosphere. Sandbags are piled up at various intersections, and engineers are working hard to build fortifications. Many sensitive Zhenjiang residents are leisurely saying: "These are the outer defenses of peace. It seems that neither side will continue fighting."</p>
<p>Sails Fully Loaded with Refugees</p>
<p>The Jiaoshan Temple, protruding from the river, which has always been secluded in a tranquil world, is now different from the past. Cruising around are naval patrol ships and countless gunboats, instead of tourists' painted boats. The fishing boats, which have always been accustomed to life on the water, have lost the means to rely on Jiaoshan for their livelihood. Now, there are only sails carrying groups of homeless refugees, passing by under the turbulent mountain waters, heading for safer shores on the river.</p>
<p>Sweeping Clearance Sale Signs</p>
<p>During the lunar New Year, people in Zhenjiang experienced deep emotions. Merchants were settling their profits and losses. Every household was anxious and planning for the end of the year and the arrival of the New Year. On the streets, vendors sold New Year cakes, firecrackers, door gods, Spring Festival couplets, and other items related to the New Year preparations. The shops, imitating Beijing and Shanghai, also hung up signs for "Sweeping Clearance Sales" and price reductions to attract business. Food shops were filled with "Jinhua Ham," "Guangdong Sausages," and "Nanjing Salted Duck," all kinds of preserved meats. The toys that children played with during the lunar New Year were also displayed on the streets, but the prices were high, and the provincial and county-level civil servants with meager incomes could only "covet the fish from the edge of the pond," admiring them for a while. Since yesterday, the streets and alleys have been adorned with new sights, "Selling Yangzhou Flowers," "Selling Yangzhou Flowers," evoking the feeling of "still selling Yangzhou flowers across the river." The hearts of people who have always lived in the warmth of Jiangnan are stirred by different emotions.</p>
<p>Trains Unprecedentedly Busy</p>
<p>In the past half month, the trains between Nanjing and Shanghai have been unprecedentedly busy and crowded due to the large-scale evacuation of various agencies in Nanjing. Every time a train from Nanjing arrives at the Zhenjiang station, it is already packed. Large numbers of passengers waiting for the train on the platform bridge, as well as carriers, risk jumping from the overpass onto the roofs of the cars or climbing in through the carriage windows, resulting in falls, injuries, or even deaths. In recent days, due to frequent military transport, trains have been delayed. The Shen Bao, Xin Bao, and Da Gong Bao in Shanghai also often miss their arrival in Zhenjiang. It is hoped that the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway authorities will quickly find a way to dispatch vehicles and schedules to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<p>Ding Zhi-pan Encourages Colleagues</p>
<p>The civil servants of various departments and offices under the province are now jointly requesting the provincial government to follow the example of the central government and issue severance pay to make arrangements for settling down. Chairman Ding Zhi-pan said to his colleagues at the memorial week meeting on the 24th: "At this time of national turmoil, we must stabilize ourselves and not disturb each other in order to stabilize society. Peace is what everyone hopes for, and we should await the decision of the central government. As for the livelihood of our colleagues, we are always concerned. The salary for January has been paid in advance, and the salary for February is also being advanced. We hope that we can unite in spirit and overcome the difficulties together." Finally, Ding encouraged them with "Righteousness should be upheld, not personal gain pursued," and "The Way should be understood, not personal merit calculated."</p>
<p>The First Line of River Defense</p>
<p>[Dispatch of 26th] Since the abandonment of Yangzhou on the night of the 24th, Zhenjiang has been the first line of defense along the Yangtze River. On the 25th alone, ferries between here and Liuhe across the river made extra trips to evacuate troops and refugees retreating from Yangzhou. The Communist troops only advanced to Shijiaqiao (11 li south of Yangzhou City). The troops and civilians who gathered at Liuhe on the 25th have all safely arrived in Zhenjiang. From the 26th, the Zhenjiang-Liuhe ferry was announced to be suspended. It is estimated that more than 20,000 troops and civilians retreated from southern Yangzhou. The refugee crowds wandering the streets along the Zhenjiang River further increased the bleakness of this end-of-year scene.</p>
<p>Hoping for Good News during the Spring Festival</p>
<p>After the abandonment of the outposts across the river, the Navy is cooperating with the Jiangnan land defense forces to carry out river defense tasks. River defense gunboats are closely monitoring the actions of the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu. Although this place faces the front lines, the citizens are calmly watching the development of the situation and especially hope that the Spring Festival will bring good news of peace. The five newspapers here will suspend publication during the Spring Festival and will provide news to the citizens daily in a joint edition. The provincial government has completed its preparations for relocation. Seventy percent of the personnel from various departments and bureaus will leave Zhenjiang first, with their families following them. The provincial government will issue free train tickets. The evacuating personnel and their families will await Chairman Ding's order and board the train to leave Zhenjiang at any time. Ding will lead the remaining 30 percent of the personnel to temporarily stay in Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Sufficient Coal Supply</p>
<p>Here, due to the lack of coal, the water and electricity plant has been implementing power outages by region for two months. Now that the Spring Festival is approaching, and at a time of turmoil, the supply of water and electricity is especially indispensable. The provincial government implemented emergency measures on the 25th, requisitioning coal passing through to maintain the water and electricity supply in the provincial capital, impounding 1,700 tons, which the Zhenjiang water and electricity plant will pay for at 3,500 yuan per ton. This amount of coal is sufficient for the water and electricity plant for one month. During the Spring Festival, there will be no interruption of water and electricity throughout the city.</p>
<h3>Xilin Garden Residence in Xiamen Refurbished and Newly Decorated</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Xiamen, 26th] A few days ago, Reuters and Associated Press in Nanjing speculated that President Chiang might stay briefly on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen via Fuzhou in the near future. The news has been quite uplifting to the various circles here. According to some current indications, the rumors are not without basis. A month ago, the post of director of the Xiamen Police Bureau was assigned by the Presidential Office to Liu Shuzi, who was President Chiang's deputy adjutant. Since taking office, he has paid special attention to public security in Xiamen. At the same time, Xilin, the private garden of overseas Chinese Huang Zhonghuan, formerly the office of the Southern Fujian Division on Gulangyu Island, was taken over by Director Li sent by the Presidential Office for repairs. It is located under Zheng Chenggong's training platform on Sunlight Rock, with a spacious and towering area. Previously, it was quite dilapidated due to disrepair. Recently, after being repaired by personnel from the Presidential Office, it has been refurbished and newly decorated, and the layout is quite gorgeous. Police Chief Liu Shuzi has personally supervised the repairs.</p>
