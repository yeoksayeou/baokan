<h3>月浦等區轉趨沉寂　浦東戰事全面展開</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部發布戰況：（一）匪一部二千餘人，十九日晨九時向我劉行陣地猛撲，我守軍奮勇還擊，戰至兩小時，匪終不支潰退，是役計斃傷匪一千餘人，生俘百餘人，鹵獲戰利品甚夥，現劉行·月浦等地區寂靜異常，為上海保衛戰開始以來各戰塲所未有之沉寂。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部十九日上午十一時消息：</p>
<p>（一）十八日黃昏後，細雨迷濛，月浦·楊行地區戰事轉趨沉寂，犯罪連日雖裹脅多數民兵，拼死來攻，但在堅強國軍嚴重打擊之下，實力損失將盡，殘部刻正竄至距月浦·楊行外圍甚遠之地區，喘息整補。</p>
<p>（二）十八日晚八時許，由南翔北竄之匪軍一部，向我劉行附近國際電台國軍陣地進犯，守軍憑藉堅強工事，沉着奮戰，匪傷亡慘重，我方陣地始終屹立無恙，迄十九日晨止雙方仍對峙中。</p>
<p>（三）浦東方面戰事已全面展開，十八日深夜，錢郎中橋，金家橋及東三林塘等地國軍，同時對來犯匪軍，主動出擊，我神勇空軍亦黑夜出希，臨空助戰，匪軍首尾不顧，斃傷甚夥，詳細戰果正淸查中。</p>
<p>（四）匪七百餘名昨竄抵浦東東溝吳家宅一帶，經我派隊往剿，全部被殲滅。（五）劉家行正面之匪約一萬餘名，於十九日晨二時向我陣地連續猛撲，戰鬥異常激烈，我砲兵集中火力猛射，故昨晚該地區隆隆之聲從未間歇，匪以人海投我火海，死傷甚重，我陣地屹立無恙，戰事至十九日晨十時，猶在激烈進行中。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部發布戰況：</p>
<p>（一）十八日下午六時匪某部約一營兵力，由劉行西南渡河，企圖偷襲我某師陣地，經我發現後，由砲兵猛烈轟擊，被殲大半，其餘狼狽竄逃。</p>
<p>（二）十八日晚國際電台以西，匪約五六百人向我陣地攻擊，我守軍沉着狙擊，戰鬥異常激烈，匪傷亡過半，其殘部企圖潰逃，我官兵乘戰勝餘威，施行反擊，匪望風披靡，四處竄逃，被我殲滅殆盡。</p>
<p>（三）十九日一時許，顧家宅西北一帶，匪約兩個營向我陣地反復攻擊七八次，我守軍官兵沉着迎擊，至拂曉匪負創潰退。</p>
<p>（四）劉行匪正面約五百餘人，十九日拂曉前偷向我陣地蠢動，我官兵發覺後並不發槍，待其接近我碉堡外圍鐵絲網，我守軍官兵見殲匪機會已到，一湧二出，一齊以手榴彈猛烈投擲，炸斃匪大半，餘匪見來勢兇猛，未及應戰，狼狽而逃。</p>
<h3>淞滬防衛總部　發布綜合戰況　莘莊七寶等區國軍嚴密部署</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部發布綜合戰況：</p>
<p>（一）淞滬西北全綫，匪一週來連續分頭向我各個據點守軍陣地猛犯，經我陸海空協力配合奮擊，迄前日晚止，匪軍至少有兩個軍以上之兵力被我大部消滅，殘部亦向原路潰竄，至十七日晚八時起，我獅子林，月浦，楊行，國際電台，劉行，顧家宅等地守軍，復對新近連續抽調增援企圖挽回頹勢之另部匪軍（共計三個軍以上的番號）主動展開反擊，匪再三藉劣勢之砲火作掩護，一夜間對我更番作六七次以上人海衝鋒，戰鬥慘烈空前，匪終未得逞，激戰至十八日晨，我軍陣地前匪潰屍達兩千餘具，其一度突入月浦以南陣地之匪，亦告全數被殲，現該綫戰事已趨沉寂。（二）莘莊七寶及虹橋機塲地區國軍防綫，刻正重新完成嚴密部署，駐守有雄厚之優秀兵力，沿滬杭綫企圖迫近滬郊之匪軍各部，因懾於國軍之砲火威力，趦趄不前，一般相信，該綫我軍防務，絕對確保無虞，匪如再冒昧來犯，將遭受到月浦楊行一綫之同樣嚴重打擊。</p>
<p>（三）浦東方面匪三萬餘，十七日晚十時曾分股向我王家灣，高行鎮及新陸鎮等地大舉進犯，我軍以逸待勞，在神鷹助戰下，士氣極為旺盛，激戰延展至十八日晨，我生力軍源源開到增援之擊，卒將匪完全擊潰，其另部鑽隙到達南橋以南，八字橋附近之匪，刻正在我步兵及裝甲部隊包圍聚殲中。</p>
<h3>守衛吳淞區作戰中　新海軍發揮威力　奠定保衛上海勝利基礎</h3>
<p>大上海保衛戰，已經獲得第一個勝利，而且這個勝利是澈底的，共產黨匪軍足足損失了二萬人，兩個軍已經潰不成軍，在堅強的陸空守備下，我新海軍屬於馬紀壯司令統率的這一艦隊，用無情的砲火，摧毀了敵人的攻擊。</p>
<p>共產黨匪徒，開始在進攻上海這個迷夢上遭遇到堅強的抵抗，而宣告失敗了，這對於我們保衛大上海，只是一個開始，接着將是無數個勝利，和無量　無情的海軍砲火加諸共產黨——那些殘害中國人民自由生活的野獸。</p>
<p>砲火正如鞭炮熱烈的響着，在這個星期第二天，我陸海軍進入吳淞區作戰的晚上，共產黨用兩個軍拼命的渡過瀏河，沿獅子林，月浦，用滲透戰術，繼以人海戰法，集中火力，摧毀陸上守軍碉堡，向寶山，楊行等地進攻，馬紀壯司令的艦隊，就在這種緊急情況下，在預定的海軍戰鬥據點上，和共軍接手。</p>
<p>五月十三日晚上，馬紀壯司令，得到情報，共軍的廿九和廿八軍，傾全力向獅子林和月浦進攻，想在兩天內攻到吳淞，摧毀並突破上海外圍工事據點，打斷上海對外的水上交通，馬司令根據這個情況，在七點光景下作戰命令，指揮原在白茆沙一帶巡弋的軍艦向獅子林，瀏河出擊，同時從吳淞調派艦艇向往瀏河，獅子林作戰的軍艦會師，以密結的砲火壓制敵人，使進攻的共軍，完全在海軍的強烈的火力封鎖下，無法進展，並用主砲，阻擊共軍后援。戰事一直進行到十二點鍾，共產黨不顧生死，仍圖利用黑夜，以人海戰術向獅子林月浦等地前進，當他進攻愈烈，我們的砲火便益加兇猛，十四號拂曉，匪再結集一個師，附大小砲四十餘門，作第三度猛攻，賴陸上守軍艱苦奮戰，我海軍以撲滅性的火力猛烈掃射，天亮后，共軍的鬥志，完全消沉。</p>
<p>我們，我到桂永淸將軍總部，綜合陸海軍戰報，昨晚一夜激烈戰鬥，敵人傷亡了六千餘人，在海軍強烈的砲火壓制下，田都宅一帶，匪軍卽有二千餘人，完全殲滅殆盡。</p>
<p>海軍不但砲火猛烈，而且射擊的彈着點，百分之百，都是準確的。</p>
<p>「這是第一個勝利的序幕，」馬紀壯告訴我，這個序幕，揭開了上海保衛戰勝利的基礎，從十二日到十七日，共軍反復的向月浦，楊行，牛角尖，石洞口不斷的進攻，我海軍便不斷的輪番的支援陸軍，用無情的砲火，壓制敵人，一直使共軍抬不起頭來，一直保持着強烈的火攻記錄。</p>
<p>馬紀壯司令告訴我，對於上海保衛戰的信心，出於桂永淸總司令堅強的領導，「祇准成功，不許失敗」，馬紀壯將軍就在這範疇裏，率領他的艦隊，埋頭奮鬥，十四日晚上，匪軍另一個瘋狂攻勢又來了，月浦第一綫壘堡完全用「死人」的最高記錄攻佔，海軍在這個緊急情況下，沒有考慮到這個守備區戰鬥的後果，桂總司令命令，馬司令立刻親率「太和」「永靖」兩艦出擊，對唐灣，新鎮，牛角尖等地匪軍，作澈底毀滅性的轟擊，幾小時內，使陸軍完全恢復了那些失去的碉堡，保持守備區原有態勢，當他們進行轟擊正酣的時候，敵人的砲，有幾十發，落在軍艦附近，「但是幸運得很，一砲也沒有擊中」，馬紀壯司令事後，這樣對我說。</p>
<p>接着湯恩伯總司令來了電話，對他們——海軍的攻擊精神和獲致輝煌的戰果，表示嘉獎，下午，湯將軍親自到馬紀壯將軍的旗艦上慰問，當面並犒賞馬紀壯艦隊全體官兵二萬銀元。</p>
<p>馬紀壯司令，海軍代將，結實的個子，靑島海校三期畢業，典型北方人，四十來歲，是一個具有堅強意志的海軍靑年將領，他對於這次統率艦隊保衛上海，充滿了勝利信心，也感覺着無比光榮。</p>
<p>馬紀壯司令告訴我，這次共軍採取的攻擊方式，完全在他的預料之中，所以，他是那樣沉着的安閑的寫下了這個第一個勝利的記錄。「你怎樣對付敵人的？」我問馬紀壯司令，在沒有担任這個艦隊司令前，他是這一艦隊的參謀長。</p>
<p>「簡單的很，」他說，「敵人的攻勢是不斷的，每天照例是晚上八點，十二點，第二天拂曉，」他繼續的指出他的對策，「我的艦隊使用原則，是在安全地帶控制，集中猛烈出擊。」這也就是他所採取的戰術原則，這個戰術，在陸軍上，稱為短火射擊，是屬於閃電類的突擊戰術，第二次世界大戰，美國人用這種戰術，擊敗了希特勒。</p>
<p>海軍在上海保衛戰上，比起長江守衛戰，兩面受敵的那個惡劣環境，是不可同日而語的，在上海，這個接近海洋的開闊江面，足以更進一步的發揮海軍威力，可以表現他更多的長處，劉廣凱上校，對這方面的寶貴的意見發揮了很多，劉上校是一支以主力砲聞名的艦長，他在馬紀壯艦隊裏，是一員大將。</p>
<p>由於上面這些因素，海軍的士氣是如火如茶！</p>
<p>在海陸空軍密切攜手下，在海軍的連珠砲火下，共產黨已經在吳淞守備區，遭遇到堅強的抵抗而失敗，匪廿八·廿九兩軍已潰不成軍，五天來激烈的戰事，已近尾聲，月浦楊行，這個區域，共產黨完全宣告失敗。</p>
<p>共產黨，正在企圖躲避海軍的砲火，覓取另一個攻擊目標，到了五月十六日，他集中三萬人，轉移目標，向月浦進攻，用一貫的人海戰術，突擊深入，將我×部納入他的包圍中，不幸，又為我海軍密結而猛烈的砲火，給他毀滅了，祇要海軍砲火威力所及，共產匪黨對上海的攻勢，將永遠沉浸在死亡和失敗中。（謝永炎）</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據淞滬防衛司令部發言人談稱：「昨日上午我裝甲戰車某部，又有四位戰鬥英雄，被車送國際飯店英雄館，接受榮譽而又優厚的招待，第一位是上士班長邵明福，他在本月十二日西巷戰役中，以機關砲斃匪數十名。第二位是上士班長趙長餘，在同一次戰役中，用衝鋒槍連續擊斃，並單手投擲手榴彈，炸死匪多名。第三位是上士班長徐文喜，該士操縱重機槍，猛烈向頑匪掃射，擊斃匪甚夥，且負傷不退。第四位是三級路工孫禎洲，於該役晚十時許，有匪十餘名，向我戰車猛撲，該兵不懼危險，投擲手榴彈多枚，將襲擊之匪擊斃，致使該戰車倖免於難，以上這四位勇敢善戰的英雄，實為我保衛大上海將士中之模範，我每位戰士應向這四位英雄看齊，如果每位鬥士都能同這四位英雄一樣，充分發揮戰鬥威力，大上海的保衛戰決萬無一失，這四位戰鬥英雄，京滬杭警備總部除招待三日膳宿外，並發給豐盛的慰勞品。」</p>
<h3>吳淞浦東兩綫　空軍終日助戰</h3>

<h3>國軍源源抵滬　加強保衛力量</h3>
<p>市警局毛局長談話</p>

<h3>李桂良通敵謀叛　在吳淞執行槍決</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕海軍部息：共匪叛亂以來，感受我海軍打擊甚大，乃運用種種卑劣手段，企圖分化海軍力量，兩週以前，我××軍艦在某地航行時，發現帆纜軍士李桂良為匪誘騙，通敵謀叛，當被捕獲，經本部嚴密審詢，調查屬實，於十九日上午九時，交由第一軍區在吳淞砲台灣執行槍決，以昭烱戒。</p>
<h3>宋子文離印飛比</h3>
<p>〔聯合社加爾各答十八日電〕中國前行政院長宋子文十八日偕夫人離此飛往不魯塞爾，轉赴巴黎，據隨員稱，宋氏此次出國為休養起見。</p>
<h3>香港天津恢復交通</h3>
<p>〔聯合社香港十九日電〕港政府宣布，香港與天津間已恢復交通。</p>
<h3>國民黨某負責人士稱　政府決作戰到底　再倡議中途妥協者以叛逆論罪</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十九日電〕據國民黨某負責人士談，自四月廿一日共匪悍然不顧全國人民公意，破壞和談，發動渡江軍事後，政府為實行其衛國保民之天職計，卽決定對共匪作戰到底，不再妥協之國策，此於蔣總裁·李代總統·何院長等在杭州晤商決定之四點及總裁與中國國民黨中央執行委員會先後發表之文告，均可見之。惟近來匪諜在後方仍不斷散布謠言，謂政府官吏中仍有主張再度言和者，尤其最近一週，因匪軍在贛·閩等省於我方軍事正在部署之際，伺隙進展，致謠諑亦盛，謂政府正考慮自廣州撤退，遷都西南某地，一時滿城風雨，人心惶惶，上項傳說，中央亦有所聞，故最近針對此種匪諜宣傳有兩項決議，一為國策旣已確定，任何人不得再倡和談，已由中央執行委員會通令全體黨員，政府通令各級文武官吏及人民，再有倡議中途妥協或妄發表求和言論者，以叛逆論罪。二為政府守土有責，現由政府控制之地區，均應加強保衛。華南為政府所在地，軍事當局尤應加緊部署，以求確保，此兩項決議均可表示政府對共匪作戰到底之決心，絕無中途妥協或放棄後方根據地之意，惟戰禍日益蔓延，戰事日益緊張，後方非作戰人員令其特與作戰到底之決心不相違背，且相輔相成。</p>

<h3>月浦前綫行（續）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　式之</p>
<p>依據國內新聞工作者　戰地的慣例，除在戰事沉寂期間，偶有赴第一綫視察者外，就本次旅行論，應以到吳淞卽已圓滿完成其任務，因為一則到這裏已可獲得詳確的戰報，二則從這裏循公路到月浦為十八華里，到楊行為十二華里，如循小路，則前者僅十五華里，後者僅十華里，俱在共軍山砲有效射程內，更毋論野砲及重砲，但在當時，一種好奇心及對劉玉章部堅強戰力的信心竟驅策着我們冒着生命的危險，完成了生命歷程上前所未歷的艱險旅程。</p>
<p>在由吳淞出發時，我們的配備卽已加強，除掉王科長的自衛左輪手槍外，並增加了某師政工處長戴龍山的勃郎林及另一政工人員的卡　槍。　普由吳淞循吳寶（山）公路向北行進，約廿餘分鍾，卽西向轉入一古大道，泥路崎嶇，顛簸殊甚，車行輾轉至某地，戴處長指着前面的瓦房三間告訴我，這就是某師師司令部了。</p>
<p>這時正是午後零時五十分，郭永師長已親赴團部指揮戰事，由參謀長楊敬斌扼要報告了當面戰況並攝影後卽繼續前進，當吉普剛駛至師部前面一瓦房時，遇一正在裝載砲彈卡車，車上的弟兄知道我們要到團部，就向戴處長報告原先經飛機塲附近的公路由於共軍砲彈過於密集，危險殊多，最好等他們的車子把彈藥裝好後同時由另一條路繞道前進，藉策安全。我們為了　路心且，乃建議戴處長請該部輜重部隊派一兵作　導，我們就在該　導指揮下再輾轉向西北駛進，果然，不久，車子就踏上了一條堆滿細石亂磚同時也蔓生着野草擬修但尚未正式鋪路面的公路。一路上，我們只聽到密集的機關槍聲和從車後國軍砲兵陣地所發射的陣陣砲聲。</p>
<p>突然地，公路前復展開了一條指向西北的岔道，那位擔任　導的弟兄迅卽下令司機要他循岔道並以「最高速率」前進，這時由前綫傳來的機關槍聲和砲聲更為密集，由於道途的崎嶇及車行過速，不僅我的腦袋幾次被撞上車頂發生劇痛，並且幾次幾乎被摔出車來。這時，大家的神經都已被提到緊張的最高度，只希望車子趕快把我們送到目的地。焉知也就在車子駛進岔道後不久，車子的後面突然傳來許多砲聲，而這砲聲似乎只在車後五六公尺處發出，並且始終是與車子保持相等距離發出的，這是我情知不妙，詢問戴處長這是那一方面發的砲？戴答：「是。我們自己向敵方發的砲！」大家也就放了心，車子繼續向前疾進，後面的砲聲也迄未間斷。突然地，車子的右前側約三四公尺處落了一個砲彈，接着左前側約五六公尺處又掉下一顆砲彈，由於昨日大雨，彈落在潮濕的麥田裏只是冒出高及直徑各約丈餘的一團濃密的黑煙，這時大家才恍然當初的砲聲並非國軍自己所發，而係共軍誤認我們這吉普所載係高級指揮人員而予以有計劃追擊的砲聲，匆遽間，立卽煞車，也顧不得泥濘，大家就分散匍伏在麥田裏，接着左右前後各約三至六七公尺部不等，又連續落了四顆砲彈，那時我伏在麥田裏，我吟思着：我只有「聽天由命」了！</p>
<p>大約十分鍾後，慢慢地由遠而近傳來了軋軋機聲，並正在我們的正西方數百公尺處上空往返盤旋，共軍的砲聲隨之休止，我也趕快爬起來走到路北廿餘公尺處的機槍陣地附近，發現正有一班弟兄若無其事繼續在挖土加泥，修築工事，這時我們除立卽命司機將車子調頭，東駛至安全地區相等外，我們本已再無勇氣繼續前進，但經不起戴處長和王科長的鼓勵：「前面不過兩百公尺處就是團部，我們還是到那裏去休息休息再說」。（未完）</p>
<h3>社論　今日之上海市政</h3>
<p>戰火逐漸東移，已燃及上海的四郊，砲聲隆隆，日夜不停，市民雖能力持鎮靜，一切生活如常；但內心的焦急與憂慮，終是無法隱瞞的。此時此地，已非往昔的上海可比，因此言及今日的上海市政，頗有千頭萬緒無從談起之感。陳市長曾於十七日發表「告上海市民書」，提出八項意見：（一）生活至上，民食第一；（二）治安至上，安定第一；（三）支持作戰，軍民聯合；（四）維護生產，勞資互助；（五）革興政治，肅淸貪汚；（六）穩定經濟，消滅投機；（七）世界一家，中外合作；（八）專家政治，建設上海。凡此要點，確為今日上海的當務之亟，但需要市府當局切實推行。</p>
<p>本來，上海市政府，自吳前市長離滬之後，各局負責人員亦多相繼去職，於是紛紛代行，甚至於一代再代，可說早已負責無人，只在勉強應付，敷衍門面吧了。陳市長於月初就任之際，第一就感到人事不定，政務停滯。其次就是社會動盪，民生艱困。的確，這是上海當的市政上的兩個嚴重問題。所以在本月十日以前，各局人事次第調整，社會·財政·教育·公用·民政等局新任局長均已到職視事。一方面為了解決煤荒·決定麵粉紗布換台煤。另一方面為了預防糧荒，計劃徴借民間物資，換購國外食糧。經過半個月的期間，已使市政逐漸恢復常規了。</p>
<p>所謂「吏治以得人為先」，陳市長接事後，即以市民的副食品豬隻蔬菜來源減少，提倡魚鮮代替肉類，園圃屋頂推廣種菜。又為集思廣益起見，於原有民意機關市參議會外，更將聘請大學校長專家等設立市政顧問團，參加研究設計工作。凡此都可見當局的顧慮周詳，求治心切。</p>
<p>不過，今日之上海已在動盪之中，到處是一片混亂，法令亂，金融亂，社會秩序亂，正是千頭萬緒，有待提　挈領，以簡馭繁。固不可能好整以暇，紛飾太　；也不需要盡餅充飢，徙尚空談；時間上更不容許再作從容打算。當前市民所仰望於市政當局者很簡單，只在實事求是的安定社會，穩定經濟，鎮定人心，藉以維持生活，保障生存而已。管子牧民篇有曰：「知時者可立以為長，無私者可置以為政」。今日當局果能在積極方面做到「知時」，在消極方面做到「無私」，則一切困難問題，都不難迎刃而解。</p>
<p>安定社會首在維持社會秩序，四郊正砲聲隆隆，人心自然不免浮動恐慌，此時此地，不但千萬不能亂，而且要秩序井然，安定如常；水電交通無論如何要保護週密，維持正常；學校要照常上課；機關要照常辦公；醫院要照常開診；餘如街道市容的整飭，攤販的管理，奸宄的緝拿，以及盜匪火災的防範，處處都要加強注意。</p>
<p>穩定經濟首在維持生產，目前市區停工的工廠應即協助復工，閉歇的商店應即勸導復業，停頓的市塲應即恢復交易。而幣值的穩定，猶為首要之圖。至於鎮定人心，首在革新政治，陳市長暨各局新任局長都是「奉命於危難之際」，勇於負責，臨難不苟，已使面臨着砲火的上海市政走向革新之路。於此果能一本大仁大智大勇的精神，且作團棋賭墅之謝安，領導全市公教人員鎮定工作，「子帥以正，孰敢不正」，市民心理上自然也會跟着鎮定起來。</p>
<p>此外如救濟難民，撫輯流亡，以及提高公教待遇，澈底肅淸貪汚；裁併駢枝機構，增強行政效率；都是當務之急。時急矣，現在的施政要迅速，要確實；所謂快，要說做就做；所謂有辦法，要說做到就做到；沒有因循，不許洩杳。當局者不僅要為廉吏，還要為能吏，因為最迫切的工作是在安定，在穩定，在鎮定；至於魚鮮代肉，屋頂種菜，與設立顧問團之類，倒在其次。</p>

<h3>聯合國大會閉幕　關於義大利舊屬地問題　決展至九月間大會討論</h3>
<p>〔合眾社富勒興十八日電〕聯合國大會於今日午後六時十七分休會。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞社富勒興十八日電〕聯合國第三屆大會今晚閉幕，將於秋季重開。際此本屆會議結束之時，秘書長賴伊告代表稱：「和平之希望已趨光明，對於聯合國之堅強信念亦為長時期來所僅見。」印尼問題已決定展期討論，以免影響在聯合國主持下目前在巴達維亞舉行之印荷談判。此外新聞自由公約草案亦議決展期至秋季會議，蓋本屆會議中幷無充份時間加以討論。第四屆聯大定於九月二十日揭幕。</p>
<p>〔合眾社富勒興十八日電〕聯合國十八日結束其第三屆大會。五十九國大會今晨否決貝文及史福薩所提分配前義大利殖民地之建議，頃以五十一對零票，義決將殖民問題之再行討論事宜，展期至九月間第四屆大會進行。當大會主席伊伐特準備閉會時，波蘭代表要求辯論德共艾斯勒一案，圖促聯合國干涉艾氏之逃亡事。伊伐特未予許可，認為在大會正將休會之際，事實上無討論此案之可能。此事付諸表決，維持大會主席原則。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬十八日電〕聯合國大會之拒絕貝文·史福薩處理義國前殖民地計劃，使此間人士極感失望。政界人士雖希望在下屆大會討論此問題時或可獲得較有利於義國之解決，但此間權威人士認為大會中一部份會員國對於歸還義國殖民地所取之仇視態度，極為嚴重。義國各報對此事則未作任何評論。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕此間英政府官方人士對聯合國大會之拒絕貝文·史福薩計劃表示扼腕，但外交部發言人則謂：英國準備接受聯合國通過之任何處理辦法。</p>
<h3>巴黎四外長會議　可望獲臨時協定　美英法正從事秘密會商</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十九日電〕消息靈通人士今日稱，未來巴黎四外長會議時，美英法將與蘇聯成立德國問題之臨時協定，而不奢望一勞永逸之解決。</p>
<p>依照預定計劃，將設立德人委員會，作為西德政府與東德人民議會間之聯絡機關，俾使德國象徴的統一，以待東西間真正合作。美特使傑塞普與國務部顧問波倫，英外部專家季爾巴德立克，法外部秘書長巴洛第，日來正就此事作秘密會商。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十八日電〕三強代表今日繼續在此舉行外長會議召開前之會談，以謀統一西方三國在外長會中之步驟。英駐德總司令羅勃森中將，暨法駐德總司令之顧問彭塞，亦參與會談。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科十九日電〕參加巴黎四國外長會議之蘇聯代表，將包括外長維辛斯基，德境蘇軍總司令邱可夫元帥，及蘇聯外交部之高級官員斯米爾諾夫與鮑德賽洛夫。斯米爾諾夫曾參加一九四七年之莫斯科會議及去年之柏林問題談判代表團中，尚有顧問七人專家二人，外交家十三人及其他人員四十六人，故總數共達七十人以上。外長維辛斯基之夫人及新聞記者二人，亦將同時前往巴黎，秘書十二人則已離此飛往巴黎。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕此間今日宣佈，外長貝文將於星期五離此前往巴黎，與法外長許曼及美國務卿艾契遜在外長會議召開前舉行預備談話。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十八日電〕英美法三國代表及對德問題專家，今日午後繼續在法國外交部舉行預備會議，但對討論經過則未發表。</p>
<h3>加承認以色列</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社渥太華十八日電〕此間今日宣佈，加拿大政府已正式承認以色列。按加拿大在去年十二月時，卽對以色列作事實上之承認。</p>
<h3>蘇限制汽車　駛入柏林蘇軍區</h3>
<p>美方認為又一間接封鎖</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十八日電〕蘇聯今日限制汽車駛入柏林與蘇軍區。西德人士認為此乃蘇軍區馬克貶值之故，美方且認此為間接封鎖。同時，四國關於寬放貿易與運輸之談判似已破裂，凡此情形均發生於柏林封鎖解除一星期後，美國軍政府運輸專家狄克斯已趨往海姆斯丹特，調查西德卡車一五〇輛被阻於蘇聯邊界真相。據官方報告蘇聯戌兵突然要求各車出示東德經濟委員會所發許可證，蘇方並要求管制西柏林之一切出口，美方人士稱，此乃微妙封鎖重新開始之表現，目的在使美英法僅在柏林留駐軍事代表團，一切原料均仰給蘇聯。</p>
<h3>蘇將重新參加　柏林盟軍政府</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十八日電〕此間英方官員相信，蘇聯不久或將重返柏林之四強盟國軍政府。蘇聯係於去夏退出該部。英官方預料蘇聯第一步將先派觀察察員一名列席，但柏林區蘇軍司令柯的柯夫少將之親自出席亦未始不可能</p>
<h3>蘇報強調四國善意合作　為和平主要條件　此一合作路徑將由外長會中獲得</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十九日電〕莫斯科新時代週報評稱：諸強國之合作為持久和平主要的條件，而重建此一合作的路徑，現已十分明顯，如欲下屆討論德國問題之外長會議獲得成功，則西方國家，必須放棄其恐嚇武斷的方法。所謂波恩憲法之迅速草成及西德臨時政府之匆遽設立，頗足使人懷疑，須知類似的製造旣成事實的企圖，對其作者決不有何裨益，因為世界人士莫不皆知任何政治或國際問題，決非戰爭所能解決，在下屆外長會中雙方務必出以善意。柏林問題為德國問題完整的一部，雅爾達及波茨坦協定為解決德國問題的基礎。蘇聯始終相信，柏林以及德國問題，須用四國談判的方式始能獲得解決。</p>
<h3>亞洲現行局勢之發展　嚴重威脅世界和平　艾契遜對記者宣布極為關切中國</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十八日電〕艾契遜國務卿今日在每週記者招待例會上，聲明美國目前並未考慮參加太平洋防務公約。但渠承認，在亞洲的局勢中，存在着對於世界和平嚴重的危險。記者請其對嚴重危險之點詳家聲明。艾氏表示，渠所關切者多圍繞於目前中國惱人局勢的週圍。</p>
<p>談及太平洋公約問題時，渠謂，余以為提出此項建議者，殆未研究北大西洋公約演變與進化，大西洋公約之產生，乃由於歐洲及大西洋公約國家所特有的一連串環境，故該約乃為一連串發展會乎邏輯的結果。渠有曰，亞洲局勢中雖已有對於世界和平嚴重的危險存在，但誠如尼赫魯氏所云，在亞洲內部現有的糾紛，獲得解決以前，太平洋公約亦難以形成，由於此等內部糾紛。故依照大西洋公約的路綫，以組織太平洋公約的時機尚未成熟，艾契遜表示，尼赫魯氏此等意見，乃為以客觀的立塲，估計當前實際的可能性。</p>
<h3>對西德問題　決不作讓步</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕國務卿艾契遜今日在此招待記者時宣稱：西方各國在巴黎外長會議中，對西德問題決不作讓步。國務卿堅稱：英美法三國之對德協定，決不成為四國外長會議中之爭論目標。彼對克萊將軍昨日發表之聲明表示同意，亦主張佔領軍應繼續留駐於德國。且謂，蘇方之表示願意談判，僅圖使冷戰暫時平息。艾氏證實稱：彼在抵達巴黎後，立卽將與英法二外長會商，俾在四國外長會議召開前，對各項問題作一綜覽。</p>
<h3>韓外交國防部發表聲明　要求美軍事援助　指蘇聯武裝北韓陸空軍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城十九日電〕南韓外交部與國防部今日發表聯合聲明，要求美國積極軍事援助。據稱：蘇聯已同意武裝北韓軍隊九師，並借給北韓飛機二百二十架與巡邏艇二十艘。目前北韓軍隊實力約為二十萬名，南韓則僅五萬人，美國給予南韓之援助，至少應與蘇聯給予北韓者相等。美軍自南韓撤退前應使南韓獲得適當之保護。</p>
<p>〔合眾社漢城十九日電〕朝鮮共和國外長十九日在特別記者招待會中，公開要求聯合國朝鮮委員會，對盛傳該委會在計劃與北韓人民政府談判朝鮮統一之說，聲明其立塲。</p>
<h3>日財政困難　二千餘市長辭職</h3>
<p>村長二人竟致自殺</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京十九日電〕每日新聞載稱：據調查所得結果，日本一萬六千個地方自治政府之市長及首領二千餘人，均已因財政極度困難而先後辭職。據稱，此係由地方政府自給自足之新財政措施所造成，對於麥帥總部所推行之發展地方自治政府以配合日本民主化之政府，不啻一嚴重打擊。該報稱：本州西部岡山縣有二村長因無法執行職務而自殺。又稱：地方政府首長紛紛辭職之顯著原因之一，係因不能應公眾之要求，建立小學六年中學三年及三年高等學校之新學制。</p>
<h3>美遺失鈾塊　一部份已發見</h3>
<p>此一神秘事件已漸平息</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕原子能委員會今日發表聲明稱：被認為遺失之三十二克鈾二三五。已在試騐室之廢物堆中發現一部份，故此項使人民感覺極度緊張之「神秘事件」，已逐漸平息。聲明中稱：遺失之三十二克鈾中，已有二十五克在廢物堆中發現，尚有七克或已被竊或遺失，聯邦警察目下仍在廢物堆內繼續搜尋中。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十九日電〕參院原子能委員會主席民主黨員麥克瑪洪聲稱：原子實騐室所失小量之鈾，對於製造原子武器，並無價值，美國保安人員不信此事含有任何間諜問題。</p>
<h3>南指匈挑釁　槍傷邊界衛兵</h3>
<p>〔路透社貝爾格萊特十九日電〕南斯拉夫政府今日發表正式聲明，指匈牙利企圖對一社會主義國家挑釁的引起事故。聲明中指出南國邊界衛兵一名，上週六被匈兵開槍受傷，匈政府故意引起事件，迫使南斯拉夫採取不負責的步驟。</p>
<h3>緬總理泰金諾　廿八日赴英倫</h3>
<p>接洽請英貸款事宜</p>
<p>〔路透社仰光十九日電〕權威方面息，緬甸泰金諾總理，特於廿八日啓程赴倫敦，與英政府接洽復興邊防等計劃，及請求英國貸款與緬以助其輸出米糧。</p>
<h3>哈里法克斯促英政府　再考慮西班牙問題　上院一致批准大西洋公約</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕英下議院批准大西洋公約，上議院亦於今日一致批准該約。辯論時，前外　戰時駐美大使哈里法克斯勳爵，促請政府再就西班牙問題審慎三思，俾與美國共同誘使西班牙及世界重返更切實際的途徑。海軍大臣霍爾代表政府答覆，表示如聯合國機構承認弗朗哥政權，或議決派大使駐在馬德里，則英國自當遵從。</p>

<h3>三強足球冒雨舉行　東華靑白又成平手</h3>
<p>三強邀請足球賽第二幕，東華對靑白之戰，昨日下午四時半在逸園展開，午后天不作美，細雨濛濛，浙瀝不止，惟球迷冒雨作壁上觀者，仍達二千人，比賽照常舉行，但因塲地潮濕，東華復僅到十人，仍由雙方同意改作友誼賽，結果各一和局，該賽決定展延至本週末下午四時交鋒。茲先錄兩隊陣綫如次：</p>
<p>東華</p>
<p>張邦倫</p>
<p>謝錫川　吳祺祥</p>
<p>韓尼波　關永常</p>
<p>李垚　高秀淸　韓龍海　錢久慶　陳明哲</p>
<p>靑白</p>
<p>黃仕傑</p>
<p>嚴士鑫　強智遠</p>
<p>錢長榮　孟義良　伏逎堂</p>
<p>金祿生　羅壽福　劉隆馨　劉體寅　費春華</p>
<p>比賽在霏霏細雨中展開，東華開球，韓龍海撥動皮球，高秀淸越關斬將，靑白伏逎堂阻截不力，漏個大洞，惜龍海出腳太軟，未能如願。相持至七分鍾，靑白全師挺進，金祿生沿邊直入，高高挑中，劉隆馨橫掃千軍，靑白首開紀錄。斯時雨勢益大，雙方水戰劇烈，東華力圖掙紮扎，韓龍海曾兩次奇襲，均為嚴士鑫解圍。廿七分鍾際，東華重採攻勢，吳祺祥越前探關，孟義良捨身搶救，阻成角球。未幾靑白強遠智入伍，湊足法定人數，聲勢突見旺盛，費春華偷襲，一腳行中，羅壽福不能及時感到，坐失良機，上半時暫告一段落，靑白領先。</p>
<p>再戰聲中，東華依舊十人應戰，但聲勢未衰，在三分鍾時，東華李垚妙傳高秀淸，搶步竄入，孟義良在禁區手吻球體，罰十二碼球，由高秀淸操刀，竟告落荒。靑白乘機襲擊，劉體寅劉隆馨雙管齊下，東華韓尼波一鏟化險。至十九分鍾，東華捲土重來，李垚高秀淸緊逼靑白，強遠智心猿意馬，手球犯規，由韓龍海主罰十二碼，一蹴命中，報成各一平手。此後雙方展開惡戰，你爭我奪，東華不甘示弱，吳祺祥一度以砲彈式拉射，僅差門柱寸許，但黃仕傑已飽受一塲虛驚。至終塲前三分鍾，靑白金祿生費春華兩翼齊飛，東華腹地突告緊急，金祿生超越關永常近門力叩，張邦倫撲救解除重圍，未幾時間告終，各獲一球，皆大歡喜。</p>

<h3>北平和平真像</h3>
<p>（接五月十七日第一版）</p>
<p>（七）慶祝「解放」</p>
<p>和平十三條是廿二日公布的，當天北平人正南把北的狂歡了一天，已如上述，由廿四日起，物價的重壓一天一天的加重，搶案陸續不斷的發生，各機關職工成羣索餉，流氓地痞亂肆敲詐，政府秘書長高文伯被打了，市長劉瑤章家裏被搶得僅以身免，電車公司的工人提出限三天要五萬大頭的條件了，否則將縱火燒房，一連串威脅人的事實筆不勝書。由此北平人的笑臉歛了，一般人多恢復了原有的世故，在這段期間，街頭巷尾雖然隨時隨地的有藝工隊的男女們在進三步退一步的扭秧歌，高一陣低一陣的唱「東方紅，太陽升，中國出了個毛澤東」，但人們多以耍猴的心情去欣賞，絲毫沒影響感情。二月一日終於降臨，聯合機構宣佈成立，但是無聲無臭，絲毫沒有作用，一部份人如夢初醒，一般人仍是失望，詳情俟後在述。</p>
<p>二月二日北平市人民政府接收人民日報所謂的「偽市政府」，葉劍英訓話雖然一再強調這是人民自己政府的創立，絕不同於兩次之交給何思源，何思源之交給劉瑤章，但北平人則以為二百多萬市民並沒有一個人選，葉劍英當市長，而今紛說是他們自己的政府，實在有點不敢高攀，尤其是各項威脅，因他們自己的政府創立而日增，故市政府職員在聽訓當中雖曾報以勉強的微笑，但那是苦笑，那是應酬的笑，而不是真笑。</p>
<p>二月三日解放軍舉行解放北平的入城式前一天晚上，各保傳令各戶每家必須出一個人，到前門內廣塲去集合，準備歡迎，屆時還要點名，槍桿在人家手裏，還有誰敢不去呢！加以北平人從來沒有見過解放軍究竟什麽樣，姞令你拉一條南方的水牛在街上走，也必有多少人圍觀，又何況久仰大名的解放軍呢？故那天真是人山人海，塞滿了街頭，美記者穆　，季昂認為北平人是以被征服者的心情去歡迎解放軍，確是侮辱了北平人，實則北平自遼見都，業歷千載，改朝換代幾有十次，由於歷史的陶鎔，居民飽經世故，有過於英倫紳士，除到生死關頭，他們從沒把自己看作舞台上的人物，故此次歡迎解放軍，與其說是歡迎，不如說是旁觀，與其說他們自己跑了一次龍套，不如說他們看了一次　北平。但這話只是指着真正的老百姓說的，至於各部份共黨所組的藝工隊，那就另當別論了。</p>
<p>這次戲是這樣唱的，主角解放軍於上午十時分兩路入城，一路從豐台來，由永安門入城，另一路從海甸來，由西直門入城，會合之後，轉向南走，由西長安街經和平門向西出廣安門，浩浩蕩蕩由上午十時到下午四時，前隊已走出了和平門，後隊還在向永定門及西直門擁進，林彪·羅榮桓·聶榮臻·葉劍英於上午九時半就含着勝利者的微笑，出現在前門箭樓上了。這次入城式進西直門的是所謂塔山英勇隊領頭，進永定門的是所謂暴風雨隊領頭，我是到前門外去參觀的，約十一時領頭的所謂暴風雨隊到珠市口了，帶隊的是一輛裝甲車，上面一人搖着黃斧黃鐮滿地紅的蘇旗作前導，後隨高懸毛澤東·朱德畫像，遍掛蘇旗的四輛紅卡車，卡車上滿載音樂隊，很刺耳的吹奏着國際歌曲，後面是裝甲車隊，砲隊，坦克車隊，每輛車上都　着一面鮮艶奪目的大蘇旗，此後就是騎兵步兵了，官兵的服裝一律草黃色，全跟國軍一樣，惟帽上缺着一個國徽。（未完待續）</p>
<h3>南飛客機　日有廿架　猶難應付旅客需要</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市保衛戰已進入高潮，連日離滬者又形激增，尤以兩航空公司旅客極為擁擠。龍華機塲自晨迄晚人頭擠擠，箱籠包裹堆滿於候機室內，一片雜亂景色。疏散客機均自華南飛來，隨到隨看，並無定時。若干旅客自淸晨車抵機塲後，往往須候至傍晚始能啓飛，焦急之情，露於形色，有人攜帶銀元出境者，因重量限制，亟於向人掉換美鈔，以大頭十一枚掉換美鈔十元。中國航空公司昨日飛出客機十四架，中央航空公司飛出六架，兩公司此數日來經常飛行每日二十架左右，平均每日可載客約六百人至八百人。惟尚不足應付需要。因此黑市飛機票極為猖獗，較正常票價高出約三倍至四倍。例如自滬至香港票價為三億八千萬元，黑市票竟需美金一百數十元云。</p>
<p>〔路透社喀喇蚩十八日電〕英國海外航空公司東南亞總公司今日在此宣佈，該公司暨香港航空公司之滬港航綫，已於今日起無限期停航。</p>
<h3>西北航空公司　特別班機取消</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據西北航空公司宣佈；該公司原定今日自馬尼拉來滬載客飛東京轉美國之特別班機，已予取消。其原因乃由於戰事發展，顧及旅客安全之故。</p>
<h3>工人生活維持費　社局擬定辦法五項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局查非常時期上海職工薪資計算暫行辦法實施準則第七條之規定，在工廠停工或減工期內，工人最低限度生活維持費另訂之。社局認為本市各廠情形各殊，如劃一規定，恐反滋紛擾，該局昨擬定一較有彈性之辦法五項：（一）停工減工期內，工人最低生活維持，以勞資自行協議為原則。（二）前條參照勞資評斷會工廠暫時停工工人發給維持費辦法第一款，（工廠因不可抗力突然停工，在十天以內者維持費照原有工資折半發給，在十天以上不足一月者，維持費照原有工資四分之一比例發給）之規定。（三）維持費之計算，應依照非常時期上海職工薪資計算暫行辦法第一款之規定。維持費並應比照同辦法實施準則第四·第五·第六各款規定辦理。（四）件工如無規定之底薪者，應照其最後三個月實際工作所得之照數平均計算，比照第二類規定辦理。（五）如勞資雙方協議不成，再行呈請本局核辦。以上辦法由社會局呈報市政府暨警備部政務委員會備案，並通知市商會·工業會·總工會轉令實施。</p>
<h3>黃金公債　停止發行</h3>
<p>央行所發行之黃金公債，自證交停拍後，市上交易呆滯異常。各業人士，用以週轉資金之便利已失。且價格與金市走勢相較，實瞠乎其後，故央行於昨日已決定黃金公債自卽日起停發。同時基金會亦在辦理結束中。</p>
<h3>救濟郊區難民　決撥糧食千石　社局召郊區區長談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自保衛大上海戰爭展開以來，郊區市民因受戰事影響。流離失所食宿無着者至眾。昨晨十時社會局特召集郊區區長舉行急救郊區遭受災難市民談話會，到新涇區龍浴淵，大塲區李伯高，新市區段建功，斯盛區盛璞聲，龍華區楊濟時，真如區泰鑑淸，及警備部，臨時救濟會，警察局，民政局代表。由社會局第二處皮處長，第九科孫科長主持。席間各區區長陳述郊區區民受災情形，一部份居民住所，因軍事關係拆除，或因移入市區而食糧用品，無法帶入，生活至為困苦。其在本區以外者，本月份戶口米亦無法領得。受災情形，各區正儘量設法調查中。當卽決定撥緊急救濟食糧一千石，發給郊區受災市民。嗣就分發技術問題交換意見，至十二時散會。</p>
<p>又決定由臨時救濟委員會撥米二百石，救濟浦東難民。</p>
<h3>紅十字會籌劃救濟工作　陳市長覆函致謝並歡迎</h3>
<p>日內瓦國際紅十字會，鑒於上海市郊發生戰事，廣大羣眾所受危險與威脅，至為關懷。該會駐港代表皮利，曾在廣州訪晤行政院長何應欽將軍及外交部有關人士，建議該會在滬如何展開救濟工作事宜。皮利氏曾於五月八日至滬拜會陳市長，正式表達此意。紅十字會駐滬代表埃格利於本月十七日致函陳市長，申述該會已向我政府當局及共黨接洽，俟有回音，當卽轉告，該會駐港代表積極在規定範圍內協助進行。陳市長對於國際紅十字會此項道義慈善建議，極為感激，業於前（十八）日覆函表示誠摯謝意與歡迎。</p>
<h3>國內國際郵資　今起調整</h3>

<h3>銀元價格　國行昨日掛牌　每枚合金圓券九百六十萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀圓價格，業由中央銀行於昨晨十時許正式掛牌，每枚合金圓券九百六十萬元。</p>
<p>中央銀行昨為銀元掛牌事，復發表新聞如次：茲經京滬杭警備總司令部政務委員會決定，每日由中央銀行掛牌，凡持有銀元兌換執照之兌換店，應一律根據中央銀行牌價營業。交易手續費約合牌價百分之二。兌出價格不得牌價高出二十萬圓以上。收進價格不得比牌價低出二十萬圓以外，例如：中央銀行三十八年五月十九日掛牌價每枚銀元合金圓券九百六十萬圓，則兌換店兌出銀元一枚之價格，不得超過九百八十萬元，收進銀元一枚之價格，不得少於九百四十萬圓，手續費將來必須變動時，得再行規定。此項辦法，已由京滬杭警備總司令部通令警察局社會局及金管局嚴格執行。</p>
<p>昨日銀元市況，央行牌價距離黑市仍遠，故一般商號，買賣仍在停頓之中。有少數幾家，掛九〇萬進，一〇五〇萬出，如向其買，則回說並無收進。馬路銀牛行蹤飄忽，行情混亂不一。</p>
<p>昨日金銀交換行市轉平，對搭做四四，四七，一種貨做四三，四六，二種貨做四五，四八，雜洋做四八，五三，亦有做四七，五二。金鈔交換，仍做五十元，五十三元。鈔銀交換又縮二角，美鈔已步步落後，一種貨做八元三，八元八，二種貨做八元七，九元二，對搭做八元五，九元，惟雜洋尚平，仍做九元五，十元。飾金掉銀元，市況平定，商號掛牌，雜洋仍為四八，五三，廠條另加二元，為五十元，五五元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀幣市勢仍俏，因金鈔價格不低，各方進多出少，廿分高至四十萬，五十萬，十分漲至二〇萬，二五萬。五分亦喊高至十萬，十五萬，較上日又漲五萬。</p>
<h3>國行支付行莊存款　搭發銀元比例確定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨日對各行莊之提取存款者，已恢複搭發銀元辦法。搭發比例，計銀元一成，銀角二成，定額本票一成，現鈔六成。</p>
<p>中央銀行最近對於各行局庫及商業行莊隔日存款餘額，除儘量供應現鈔外，並搭發定額本票及銀幣，以應實際需要。惟各行局庫及商業行莊應付存款，除以現鈔及定額本票支付外，對於所領得之銀幣，因其存款總額較存放央行之款為巨，未能比照央行所發銀幣成數付給存戶，外界頗多誤解。</p>
<p>庫存銀幣　列報備杳</p>
<p>茲悉：中央銀行撥款委員會為兼顧事實起見，業經規定，自卽日起，應由各行局庫及商業行莊，於每日營業終了時，隨將存款總額及其庫存銀幣數額，列報央行備查，次日支付存款，卽以前一日庫存銀幣，連同當日可向央行領取之銀幣數，與存款總額之比例，作為搭發銀幣之成份。不滿銀幣一元者，照給金圓券，並在營業櫃外公開揭示，俾眾週知。此項辦法，央行已通知銀錢業公會轉知各行莊照辦。並悉：上項辦法，行莊不得有任何藉口故違，所有由中央銀行搭發各行莊銀元如何支配，刻正由上海金管局隨時嚴密查報，如有不法套取情事，除勒令照數配發外，並由京滬杭警備總司令部究辦云。</p>
<h3>公教發薪津　准搭發銀元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：公教人員發給薪津，准照當日牌價，搭發一部份銀圓，其比例由中央銀行按實際情形核定。</p>
<h3>金市益形活躍</h3>
<p>銀樓飾金仍未掛牌</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲因外埠金價紛紛報漲，與本市脫節甚遠，人心殊堅，在各種優良環境下，在在利多，去化益形活躍。塲內照例漲停版，再度掛高至六六億三千六百萬，有行無市。塲外氣燄萬丈，高峯迭出，各方買氣瀰漫，晨開六三億，六六億，一路再出七十億大關，高至七二億，七五億。瀕午因央行未有拋售，漲勢更上一層，最高曾至七四億，七七億。午收稍低至七一億，七四億。午後因當局壓力重重，人心轉軟，一度回低至六八億，七一億，終以七十億七三億收盤，較上日結果又漲十億。</p>
<p>塲外美鈔亦步步上升，晨開一二二〇萬，一二七〇萬，一度高至一四八〇萬，一五三〇萬，午收一四〇〇萬，一四五〇萬，午後因浮多有了，曾低至一三三〇萬，一三八〇萬，終以一三五〇萬，一四〇〇萬收盤，再漲一百萬。</p>
<p>昨日銀樓飾金，仍無掛牌，據銀樓業公會理事長吳彭年對記者稱，該業會員，因生意淸淡，每天進出僅四五兩左右，不敷開支仍鉅，更以金價日漲夜大，營業困難，惟一俟情況好轉以後，隨時仍可恢復掛牌買賣。</p>
<h3>米價上漲過烈　經警到場監視　食油僵持未做開</h3>
<p>米市在黃金漲風之領導下，價格再見上揚，加以來源隔斷，存貨日少，故漲勢殊烈。北市塲白粳薄稻及羊秈齊叩九千萬大關，較二日狂漲一千六百萬元，達二成之多。南市塲白粳八千八百萬，薄稻八千九百萬，亦各漲一千六百萬。因連日上漲過烈，昨有經濟警員在塲暗中監視交易。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>交易淸淡，黃豆因小菜價貴，本街銷路奇佳。平湖豆漲一千萬多，菉豆亦倘，浦東菜菉六千萬。苞米雖漲不多，芝麻生仁均無開出。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>市勢盤旋，若以金銀較之，則平中帶堅。老車今做千八百萬，兵船晨開曾見上揚，中途進戶納胃懈淡，一度跌做千五百萬，收市散戶逢低有吸，回做千五百六十萬。紅蜂·大發平定，利朗洋粉午開二千七百六十萬元。</p>
<h3>棉紗喊價昂挺　布市交易停頓</h3>
<p>棉紗昨市平凡，人心散漫，聞貴州等處市價跌落，故南運去化轉呆，惟因業外金融性物品續見挺升，粗細紗雖在買意闌珊下，價格依然喊升。四十二支藍鳳，見二五五〇〇〇萬，升四八〇〇〇萬。四十支三十二支各升四億左右，廿一支雙馬現貨，做一六一〇〇〇萬，升三二〇〇〇萬。廿支各檔升一億五至三億不等，十六支以下，各升一億五至三億不等。</p>
<p>棉布市況陷於停頓狀態。</p>

<p>（四）救濟難胞：此次淞滬保衛戰之展開，砲火所及，首當其衝者，卽為吾郊區之同胞，彼等無家可歸，流落街頭，無衣無食，情狀至為淒慘。吾人除應熱烈寄予同情外，並應積極發動勸募，設法救濟，以示本黨同志，服務精神之所在。</p>
<p>上述數端，乃舉其亟切待舉者二言，至於其他配合軍事應行動員之工作，如響導·偵察·運輸等戰時任務，在在均需本黨同志從速身體力行，策東舉辦，並堅定必勝之信念，忍受目前之艱苦，全力以赴，以爭取保衛戰之最後勝利。事急矣，時迫矣，吾全市同志應如何體念黨國之艱危，速起為救黨救國救民救己而努力，此其時矣，願共勉之。中國國民黨上海特別市執行委員會印。</p>

<h3>The Yuepu and Other Areas Turn Quiet; The Pudong Battle Fully Unfolds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters released battle situation reports: (1) A bandit force of over two thousand men launched a fierce attack on our Liuhang positions at 9:00 AM on the 19th. Our defending troops fought back bravely. After two hours of battle, the bandits were finally unable to withstand the attack and collapsed in retreat. In this battle, over one thousand bandits were killed or wounded, over one hundred were captured alive, and a large number of spoils of war were seized. Currently, the Liuhang and Yuepu areas are unusually quiet, an unprecedented calm since the beginning of the Shanghai defense battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, 11:00 AM on the 19th, reported:</p>
<p>(1) After dusk on the 18th, fine rain blurred the scene, and the battles in the Yuepu and Yanghang areas turned quiet. Although the bandits had coerced a large number of militiamen in the past few days, attacking desperately, under the severe blows of the strong national army, their strength has been almost completely depleted. The remnants are now fleeing to areas far from the outskirts of Yuepu and Yanghang, taking a breather and reorganizing.</p>
<p>(2) At about 8:00 PM on the 18th, a portion of the bandit army that had fled north from Nanxiang advanced towards the national army positions of the International Radio Station near Liuhang. The defending troops, relying on strong fortifications, fought calmly and bravely. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, but our positions remained unshaken. As of the morning of the 19th, the two sides were still facing off.</p>
<p>(3) The battle in Pudong has fully unfolded. Late at night on the 18th, the national army at Qianlangzhong Bridge, Jinjia Bridge, and Dongsanlintang and other places simultaneously launched an active attack on the invading bandit army. Our brave air force also made a night appearance, providing aerial assistance in the battle. The bandit army was caught off guard, with many killed and wounded. Detailed battle results are still being investigated.</p>
<p>(4) Yesterday, over seven hundred bandits fled to the Donggou Wujiazhai area of Pudong. After we dispatched a team to suppress them, all were annihilated. (5) Over ten thousand bandits on the front line of Liujiahang launched continuous fierce attacks on our positions at 2:00 AM on the 19th. The battle was extremely fierce. Our artillery concentrated its firepower and fired fiercely, so the rumbling sound in the area never ceased last night. The bandits used human waves to throw themselves into our sea of fire, suffering heavy casualties, but our positions remained unshaken. The battle was still fiercely underway as of 10:00 AM on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters released battle situation reports:</p>
<p>(1) At 6:00 PM on the 18th, a bandit unit of about one company strength crossed the river southwest of Liuhang, attempting to sneak attack a certain division of our army. After we discovered them, our artillery bombarded them fiercely, annihilating most of them, with the rest fleeing in panic.</p>
<p>(2) On the evening of the 18th, about five or six hundred bandits attacked our positions west of the International Radio Station. Our defending troops calmly sniped at them, and the battle was extremely fierce. The bandits suffered more than half their casualties, and the remnants attempted to flee. Our officers and soldiers took advantage of the remaining power of victory to launch a counterattack. The bandits were routed at the sight of the attack and fled in all directions, but were completely annihilated by us.</p>
<p>(3) At around 1:00 AM on the 19th, about two bandit battalions in the northwest area of Gujiazhai repeatedly attacked our positions seven or eight times. Our defending officers and soldiers calmly countered, and the bandits, suffering casualties, retreated at dawn.</p>
<p>(4) About five hundred bandits on the front line of Liuhang secretly moved towards our positions before dawn on the 19th. After our officers and soldiers discovered them, they did not fire their guns, waiting for them to approach the barbed wire surrounding our bunkers. When our defending officers and soldiers saw that the opportunity to annihilate the bandits had arrived, they rushed out in two waves, throwing grenades fiercely, blasting and killing most of the bandits. The remaining bandits, seeing the fierce attack, had no time to respond and fled in panic.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters released comprehensive battle situation reports:</p>
<p>(1) On the entire northwest line of Shanghai, the bandits have continuously launched separate fierce attacks on the positions of our defending troops at various strongholds for the past week. After our land, sea, and air forces cooperated and fought bravely, at least two armies of bandits have been largely annihilated by us by the evening of the previous day. The remnants also fled in the original direction. From 8:00 PM on the 17th, our defending troops in Shizilin, Yuepu, Yanghang, the International Radio Station, Liuhang, Gujiazhai, and other places launched a counterattack on another bandit army (totaling more than three army designations) that had recently been continuously drawn in as reinforcements in an attempt to reverse the decline. The bandits repeatedly used their inferior artillery fire as cover and launched more than six or seven human wave attacks on us overnight. The battle was unprecedentedly fierce, but the bandits ultimately did not succeed. In the fierce fighting until the morning of the 18th, the bodies of more than two thousand bandits were scattered in front of our army's positions. The bandits who had once broken into the positions south of Yuepu were also completely annihilated. Currently, the battles on that line have become quiet. (2) The national army defense lines in the Xinzhuang, Qibao, and Hongqiao Airport areas are now being reorganized to complete a close deployment. A strong force of excellent troops is stationed there. The bandit armies along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, attempting to approach the suburbs of Shanghai, are hesitant to move forward due to fear of the national army's artillery firepower. It is generally believed that our army's defense on that line is absolutely guaranteed to be safe. If the bandits dare to invade again, they will suffer the same severe blow as on the Yuepu-Yanghang line.</p>
<p>(3) Over thirty thousand bandits in the Pudong area launched a large-scale attack on Wangjiawan, Gaoxingzhen, and Xinluzhen and other places in separate groups at 10:00 PM on the 17th. Our army waited at leisure, and with the assistance of the Divine Eagles, their morale was extremely high. The fierce battle extended to the morning of the 18th. Our fresh troops continued to arrive to reinforce the attack, and finally completely defeated the bandits. Another group of bandits who slipped through and reached the vicinity of Nanqiao and Baziqiao south of the river is currently being surrounded and annihilated by our infantry and armored units.</p>
<h3>In the Battle to Defend the Wusong District, the New Navy Displays its Power, Laying the Foundation for the Victory of Defending Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Great Shanghai Defense Battle has already achieved its first victory, and this victory is thorough. The Communist bandit army has suffered a loss of as many as twenty thousand people, and two armies have been routed. Under the strong land and air defense, our new navy, belonging to the fleet commanded by Commander Ma Jizhuang, used relentless artillery fire to destroy the enemy's attack.</p>
<p>The Communist bandits have begun to encounter strong resistance in their dream of attacking Shanghai, and have declared their failure. This is only a beginning for us in defending Greater Shanghai. What will follow will be countless victories, and immeasurable, ruthless naval artillery fire will be brought to bear on the Communists – those beasts who harm the free lives of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The artillery fire rang out as enthusiastically as firecrackers on the evening of the second day of this week when our land and sea forces entered the Wusong District to fight. The Communists used two armies to desperately cross the Liu River, and along Shizilin and Yuepu, used infiltration tactics, followed by human wave tactics, concentrating their firepower to destroy the land-based defending troops' bunkers and attacking Baoshan, Yanghang, and other places. Commander Ma Jizhuang's fleet, under these urgent circumstances, engaged the Communist army at the predetermined naval combat strongholds.</p>
<p>On the evening of May 13, Commander Ma Jizhuang received intelligence that the Communist army's 29th and 28th Armies were launching an all-out attack on Shizilin and Yuepu, wanting to capture Wusong within two days, destroy and break through the Shanghai outer defense fortifications, and cut off Shanghai's external water transportation. Commander Ma, based on this situation, issued combat orders at around 7:00, commanding warships that were originally patrolling the Baimaisha area to attack Shizilin and Liu River, while simultaneously dispatching warships from Wusong to join the warships operating at Liu River and Shizilin, using a dense barrage of artillery fire to suppress the enemy, so that the attacking Communist army was completely unable to advance under the strong naval firepower blockade, and using the main guns to intercept Communist reinforcements. The battle continued until 12:00 AM. The Communists, regardless of life and death, still attempted to take advantage of the darkness, using human wave tactics to advance towards Shizilin and Yuepu. As their attack became more intense, our artillery fire became even more fierce. At dawn on the 14th, the bandits regrouped a division, with more than forty large and small artillery pieces attached, and launched a third fierce attack. Relying on the hard fighting of the land-based defending troops, our navy used annihilating firepower to sweep the area fiercely. After dawn, the Communist army's fighting spirit completely declined.</p>
<p>I went to General Gui Yongqing's headquarters. According to combined land and sea military reports, in the fierce battle last night, the enemy suffered more than six thousand casualties. Under the strong artillery suppression of the navy, in the Tianduzhai area, more than two thousand bandits were completely annihilated.</p>
<p>The navy's artillery fire was not only fierce, but the impact points of the shells were also 100% accurate.</p>
<p>"This is the prelude to the first victory," Ma Jizhuang told me. This prelude opened up the foundation for the victory of the Shanghai Defense Battle. From the 12th to the 17th, the Communist army repeatedly attacked Yuepu, Yanghang, Niujiaojian, and Shidongkou continuously, and our navy continuously supported the army in turn, using relentless artillery fire to suppress the enemy, constantly keeping the Communist army from raising its head, and maintaining a strong fire attack record.</p>
<p>Commander Ma Jizhuang told me that his confidence in the Shanghai Defense Battle came from the strong leadership of Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, "Only success is allowed, failure is not." General Ma Jizhuang led his fleet in this realm, burying himself in the struggle. On the evening of the 14th, another crazy offensive by the bandit army came. The first-line bunkers in Yuepu were completely captured using the highest record of "dead men." Under these urgent circumstances, the navy did not consider the consequences of the battle in this defense zone. Commander Gui ordered Commander Ma to personally lead the "Taihe" and "Yongjing" warships to attack, launching a thorough, devastating bombardment of the bandit army in Tangwan, Xinzhen, Niujiaojian, and other places. Within a few hours, the army completely restored those lost bunkers, maintaining the original situation of the defense zone. When they were bombarding fiercely, dozens of enemy shells landed near the warships, "But fortunately, not a single shell hit," Commander Ma Jizhuang told me afterwards.</p>
<p>Then Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo called, expressing his commendation for their – the navy's – attacking spirit and the brilliant results they had achieved. In the afternoon, General Tang personally went to Commander Ma Jizhuang's flagship to offer his condolences, and in person rewarded all the officers and soldiers of the Ma Jizhuang fleet with twenty thousand silver dollars.</p>
<p>Commander Ma Jizhuang, a naval major general, a sturdy man, a graduate of the third class of the Qingdao Naval Academy, a typical northerner, in his forties, is a young naval general with a strong will. He was full of confidence in leading the fleet to defend Shanghai this time, and also felt incomparably honored.</p>
<p>Commander Ma Jizhuang told me that the Communist army's attacking methods this time were completely within his expectations, so he calmly and leisurely wrote down the record of this first victory. "How did you deal with the enemy?" I asked Commander Ma Jizhuang, who was the chief of staff of this fleet before taking on the role of commander.</p>
<p>"Very simple," he said. "The enemy's offensive is constant, and it is usually at 8:00 PM, 12:00 AM, and dawn the next day." He continued to point out his countermeasures: "My fleet's principle of use is to control in a safe zone, concentrate and launch fierce attacks." This is also the tactical principle he adopted. This tactic, in the army, is called short-range fire, and it belongs to the category of lightning-like assault tactics. In World War II, the Americans used this tactic to defeat Hitler.</p>
<p>The Navy's position in the Shanghai Defense Battle, compared to the severe environment of the Yangtze River Defense Battle, where they were attacked on both sides, is not comparable. In Shanghai, this open river surface close to the sea is sufficient to further demonstrate the navy's power and allow it to express its strengths even more. Colonel Liu Guangkai gave many valuable opinions in this regard. Colonel Liu is a fleet captain famous for his main guns, and he is a major general in the Ma Jizhuang fleet.</p>
<p>Due to these factors above, the navy's morale is soaring!</p>
<p>Under the close cooperation of the land, sea, and air forces, and under the navy's continuous artillery fire, the Communists have encountered strong resistance and failed in the Wusong defense zone. The bandit's 28th and 29th Armies have been routed. The fierce battles of the past five days are coming to an end. In the Yuepu and Yanghang area, the Communist Party has completely declared its failure.</p>
<p>The Communist Party is trying to avoid the navy's artillery fire and find another attack target. On May 16, they concentrated 30,000 people, shifted their target, and attacked Yuepu, using their consistent human wave tactics to launch a deep assault, bringing our × unit into his encirclement. Unfortunately, they were destroyed again by our navy's dense and fierce artillery fire. As long as the navy's artillery firepower can reach it, the Communist bandits' offensive against Shanghai will forever be immersed in death and failure. (Xie Yongyan)</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 19th] Bai Chongxi flew to Guangzhou by plane at 3:00 PM on the 19th to report the new military deployment in Central China to Acting President Li.</p>
<h3>Four Battle Heroes Receive Honorary Treatment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, "Yesterday morning, four more battle heroes from a certain unit of our armored vehicles were driven to the Hero Hall of the International Hotel to receive honorary and generous treatment. The first was Sergeant Squad Leader Shao Mingfu, who killed dozens of bandits with machine gun fire in the West Lane Battle on the 12th of this month. The second was Sergeant Squad Leader Zhao Changyu, who continuously shot and killed bandits with a submachine gun in the same battle, and threw grenades with one hand, killing many bandits. The third was Sergeant Squad Leader Xu Wenxi, who operated a heavy machine gun and swept fiercely at the stubborn bandits, killing many bandits and refusing to retreat despite being wounded. The fourth was Third-Class Road Worker Sun Zhenzhou, who, at about 10:00 PM during the battle, had more than ten bandits rush towards our tank. The soldier was not afraid of danger and threw many grenades, killing the attacking bandits, causing the tank to escape disaster. The above four brave and skilled heroes are the models for our soldiers defending Greater Shanghai. Every one of our soldiers should follow the example of these four heroes. If every fighter can fully display their combat power like these four heroes, the defense of Greater Shanghai will definitely be foolproof. In addition to providing three days of accommodation and meals, the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters will also issue generous慰勞品 (consolation items)."</p>
<h3>Air Force Assists in Battles All Day on Wusong and Pudong Lines</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Shanghai Defense Battle entered its eighth day on the 19th. Fierce battles unfolded throughout the day on the Wusong District and Pudong District lines. The weather was bad on the 19th, with rain clouds hanging low over the four suburbs of Shanghai. To support the army, the air force risked flying all day,穿雲上下(going up and down through the clouds) in the Wusong and Pudong districts, searching for the Communist army's positions and the Communist army units fighting against our army to bomb and strafe them. The battle results were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Bombed and strafed several Communist army artillery positions in Linjiazhai, Wangjiawan, southwest of Gaoqiao in the Pudong District, and Gujiazhai, southeast of Gaoqiao, killing and wounding over one hundred Communist army soldiers, supporting the army's battle in Donggouzhen, killing and wounding hundreds of Communist army soldiers.</p>
<p>(2) Destroyed several artillery positions in Wujiazhai, southeast of Yuepu, Qiaobanqiao, north of Liuhang, and northwest of Yanghang, supporting the army's battle in Yijiaqiao and Jinjiaqiao near Liuhang, killing and wounding over one hundred Communist army soldiers.</p>
<p>(3) Bombed and killed over one hundred Communist army soldiers in Chenjiazhai, west of Liu River, and destroyed a total of forty Communist army wooden boats in the rivers from Kunshan to Luodian and near Luodian.</p>
<p>(4) Sniped at over one thousand Communist army troops traveling along the railway from Jiaxing and Hangzhou.</p>
<p>(5) On the 18th, the Communist army in the Pudong District used many anti-aircraft guns to fire into the air. Our planes flew low all day for combat. A few planes were hit, but fortunately there were no losses.</p>
<h3>National Army Arrives in Shanghai in a Steady Stream to Strengthen Defense Forces</h3>
<p>Remarks by Director Mao of the Municipal Police Bureau</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Since the Shanghai Defense Battle began, in order to cooperate with wartime necessities, Director Mao Sen of the Municipal Police Bureau has been working more than eighteen hours every day, only returning to his residence to rest at 2:00 AM at night. Mao told reporters last night that, according to what he knew, strong national army forces are now arriving in Shanghai from a certain place in a steady stream to strengthen the defense battle force. This is enough to show the government's determination to defend Shanghai, and to fight until the final victory.</p>
<h3>Li Guiliang Executed by Firing Squad in Wusong for Colluding with the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Naval Headquarters dispatch] Since the Communist bandits' rebellion, they have felt the great impact of our navy and have used various despicable means to try to divide the naval force. Two weeks ago, when our ×× warship was sailing in a certain area, it was discovered that Petty Officer Li Guiliang had been enticed by the bandits to collude with the enemy and rebel. He was arrested and, after a rigorous interrogation and investigation by this headquarters, the facts were verified. At 9:00 AM on the 19th, he was handed over to the First Military Region and executed by firing squad at Paotaiwan in Wusong, in order to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Leaves India for Belgium</h3>
<p>[United Press, Calcutta, 18th] Song Ziwen, former President of the Executive Yuan of China, left here with his wife on the 18th to fly to Brussels, and then to Paris. According to an attendant, Song's trip abroad is for rest.</p>
<h3>Transportation between Hong Kong and Tianjin Restored</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 19th] The Hong Kong government announced that transportation between Hong Kong and Tianjin has been restored.</p>
<h3>Responsible Person of the Kuomintang Said: The Government Is Determined to Fight to the End; Those Who Advocate Compromise Midway Will Be Punished as Rebels</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th] According to a responsible person of the Kuomintang, since the Communist bandits brazenly disregarded the public opinion of the whole country on April 21, broke the peace talks, and launched a military operation to cross the river, the government, in order to fulfill its duty to defend the country and protect the people, decided to fight the Communist bandits to the end and never compromise again. This can be seen from the four points decided by President Chiang, Acting President Li, and President He in Hangzhou, and from the announcements issued successively by President Chiang and the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. However, recently, spies in the rear have continued to spread rumors, saying that there are still government officials who advocate reopening peace talks. Especially in the past week, because the Communist army in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces took the opportunity to advance while our military was deploying, the rumors have become more prevalent, saying that the government is considering withdrawing from Guangzhou and moving the capital to a certain place in the southwest. For a time, there was風雨(wind and rain) throughout the city, and people were panicked. The Central Committee has also heard of the above rumors, so recently there have been two resolutions aimed at this kind of spy propaganda: First, since the national policy has been determined, no one is allowed to advocate peace talks again. The Central Executive Committee has issued an order to all party members, and the government has issued an order to all levels of civil and military officials and the people, that anyone who advocates compromise midway or妄發表(rashly publishes)求和(peace-seeking)言論 will be punished as a rebel. Second, the government has a responsibility to defend the territory, and all areas currently controlled by the government should strengthen their defenses. Southern China is where the government is located, and the military authorities should step up deployments to ensure it. These two resolutions can show the government's determination to fight the Communist bandits to the end and that there is absolutely no intention of compromising midway or abandoning the rear base. However, as the war is spreading more and more and the situation is becoming increasingly tense, the people in the rear who are not fighting should order them to not contradict their determination to fight to the end, but rather to complement each other.</p>

<h3>Forward Line at Yuepu (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shi Zhi</p>
<p>According to the custom among domestic journalists on the front lines, except during periods of quiet in the fighting when there might be occasional visits to the front lines, based on this trip, reaching Wusong should have been considered a complete fulfillment of the task. This is because, firstly, accurate war reports could be obtained here, and secondly, from here to Yuepu via the main road is eighteen Chinese miles, and to Yanghang is twelve Chinese miles. If taking the small roads, the former is only fifteen Chinese miles, and the latter is only ten Chinese miles, all within the effective range of the Communist army's mountain artillery, not to mention field artillery and heavy artillery. However, at that time, a sense of curiosity and confidence in the strong fighting power of Liu Yuzhang's troops drove us to risk our lives, completing a perilous journey unprecedented in our lives.</p>
<p>When we departed from Wusong, our equipment was strengthened. In addition to Chief Wang's self-defense revolver, we added a Browning pistol from the Political Warfare Department Chief Dai Longshan of a certain division, and a carbine from another political warfare officer. We proceeded north from Wusong along the Wubao (Mountain) Highway. After about twenty minutes, we turned west onto an ancient road. The mud road was rugged and extremely bumpy. As the jeep twisted and turned to a certain place, Chief Dai pointed to three tiled houses ahead and told me that this was the division headquarters of a certain division.</p>
<p>It was exactly 12:50 PM. Division Commander Guo Yong had already gone to the regimental headquarters to direct the battle. After Staff Officer Yang Jingbin gave a brief report on the situation and we took photos, we continued to move forward. Just as the jeep drove in front of a tiled house in front of the division headquarters, we encountered a truck loading artillery shells. The brothers on the truck knew that we were going to the regimental headquarters and reported to Chief Dai that the public road near the airfield was too dangerous due to the density of the Communist artillery shells, and it would be best to wait until their truck had finished loading the ammunition and then take another route to bypass it for safety. Because we were anxious to get on the road quickly, we suggested that Chief Dai ask the division's transport unit to send a soldier as a guide. Under the direction of the guide, we twisted and turned northwest again. Sure enough, soon, the vehicle drove onto a highway filled with fine stones and broken bricks, overgrown with weeds, intended for repair but not yet officially paved. All along the way, we only heard dense machine gun fire and bursts of artillery fire from the Nationalist artillery positions behind us.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the road ahead opened into a fork pointing northwest. The brother acting as a guide immediately ordered the driver to take the fork and proceed at "maximum speed." At this time, the machine gun and artillery fire from the front line became even more intense. Due to the rugged terrain and excessive speed, not only did my head hit the roof of the vehicle several times, causing severe pain, but I was also nearly thrown out of the vehicle several times. By this point, everyone's nerves had been stretched to the highest level, hoping the vehicle would quickly take us to our destination. Little did we know that shortly after the vehicle entered the fork, many artillery sounds suddenly came from behind the vehicle. These sounds seemed to originate only five or six meters behind the vehicle and consistently maintained the same distance from the vehicle. I knew this was bad and asked Chief Dai which side was firing the artillery. Dai replied, "Yes, we are firing our own artillery at the enemy!" Everyone felt relieved, and the vehicle continued to speed forward, with the artillery sounds never ceasing behind us. Suddenly, an artillery shell landed about three or four meters to the right front of the vehicle, followed by another shell dropping about five or six meters to the left front. Due to the heavy rain yesterday, the shells landed in the wet wheat field, only creating dense black smoke plumes reaching about ten feet high and wide. At this time, everyone realized that the initial artillery sounds were not from our own Nationalist army but were from the Communist army, which had mistakenly identified our jeep as carrying high-ranking commanders and was carrying out a planned pursuit of it. In a hasty moment, we immediately braked, and regardless of the mud, everyone scattered and crawled into the wheat field. Subsequently, about three to six or seven meters apart, four more artillery shells landed around us, to the left, right, front, and back. As I lay in the wheat field, I thought: I can only "leave it to fate"!</p>
<p>About ten minutes later, the sound of an engine slowly approached from afar and was circling back and forth hundreds of meters above us to the due west. The Communist army's artillery fire then ceased. I quickly got up and walked to the vicinity of the machine gun position about twenty meters north of the road, where I saw a squad of brothers calmly continuing to dig soil and add mud, building fortifications. At this time, in addition to immediately ordering the driver to turn the vehicle around and drive east to a safe area, we no longer had the courage to continue forward. However, we couldn't resist the encouragement of Chief Dai and Chief Wang: "The regimental headquarters is only two hundred meters ahead. Let's go there to rest before we talk about it." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Editorial: Today's Shanghai Municipal Administration</h3>
<p>The flames of war are gradually shifting eastward, already burning on the outskirts of Shanghai. The sound of artillery roars day and night. Although the citizens are able to maintain calm and continue their lives as usual, the anxiety and worry in their hearts are ultimately impossible to conceal. This place and time are no longer comparable to the Shanghai of the past. Therefore, when speaking of today's Shanghai municipal administration, one feels a sense of being overwhelmed with countless strands and unable to know where to begin. Mayor Chen issued a "Letter to the Citizens of Shanghai" on the 17th, putting forward eight points: (1) Life first, food for the people first; (2) Security first, stability first; (3) Support the war effort, military-civilian unity; (4) Maintain production, labor-management cooperation; (5) Reform politics, eliminate corruption; (6) Stabilize the economy, eliminate speculation; (7) The world as one family, Chinese-foreign cooperation; (8) Expert politics, build Shanghai. All these key points are indeed the urgent priorities for Shanghai today, but they require the municipal government to implement them effectively.</p>
<p>Originally, after former Mayor Wu left Shanghai, many of the responsible personnel in each bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government also successively resigned. As a result, there were many acting officials, even acting after acting, which can be said to have meant no one truly responsible, merely勉强应对,敷衍门面吧了. When Mayor Chen took office at the beginning of the month, the first thing he felt was that personnel were unstable and government affairs were stagnant. The second was social unrest and the people's livelihood was difficult. Indeed, these are two serious problems in Shanghai's current municipal administration. Therefore, before the 10th of this month, personnel in each bureau were gradually adjusted, and the newly appointed directors of the social, financial, educational, public utilities, and civil affairs bureaus had all taken office. On the one hand, in order to solve the coal shortage, it was decided to exchange flour and cloth for Taiwanese coal. On the other hand, in order to prevent a food shortage, it was planned to requisition civilian supplies and purchase foreign food. After half a month, the municipal administration has gradually returned to normal.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "To govern well, one must first obtain good people." After Mayor Chen took office, he immediately addressed the problem of the reduced supply of non-staple foods such as pork and vegetables for the citizens, advocating the substitution of fish for meat and promoting vegetable cultivation on gardens and rooftops. Furthermore, to gather wisdom and expand ideas, in addition to the existing people's representative body, the Municipal Council, he will also hire university presidents, experts, and others to establish a municipal advisory group to participate in research and design work. All of this shows the government's thorough consideration and eagerness to govern well.</p>
<p>However, today's Shanghai is in the midst of turmoil, with chaos everywhere: chaotic laws, chaotic finances, chaotic social order. It is indeed a situation of countless strands, requiring提纲挈领,以简驭繁. It is certainly impossible to relax and leisurely decorate things太　; nor is it necessary to盡饼充饥,徙尚空谈; time does not allow for leisurely plans. What the citizens are currently hoping for from the municipal government is very simple: simply to seek truth from facts in stabilizing society, stabilizing the economy, and calming people's hearts, in order to maintain their lives and ensure their survival. The "Shepherd's People" chapter of Guanzi says: "Those who know the times can be established as leaders, and those who are selfless can be placed in government." If the current government can actively "know the times" and passively "be selfless," then all difficult problems can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Stabilizing society begins with maintaining social order. With the sound of artillery roaring in the suburbs, people's hearts will naturally be restless and fearful. At this time and in this place, not only must there be no chaos, but there must also be order and stability as usual. Water, electricity, and transportation must be protected thoroughly and maintained normally. Schools must continue to hold classes as usual; government offices must continue to operate as usual; hospitals must continue to provide medical services as usual. Other matters, such as the tidiness of streets and city appearance, the management of vendors, the apprehension of criminals, and the prevention of bandits and fires, must be given increased attention everywhere.</p>
<p>Stabilizing the economy begins with maintaining production. Factories in the urban area that have suspended work should be assisted in resuming work immediately. Shops that have closed should be persuaded to reopen immediately. Markets that have stagnated should resume trading immediately. The stability of currency value is the most important task. As for calming people's hearts, it begins with reforming politics. Mayor Chen and the newly appointed directors of each bureau are all "taking orders in times of crisis," bravely taking responsibility and not being perfunctory in the face of difficulties, which has led Shanghai's municipal administration, facing artillery fire, on the road to reform. If they can act with great benevolence, wisdom, and courage, and act as Xie An, who remained calm while playing chess during the battle, leading all public servants and teachers in the city to work calmly, "If the leader is upright, who would dare to be corrupt?" The citizens' minds will naturally follow suit and become calm.</p>
<p>In addition, matters such as providing relief to refugees, comforting displaced persons, raising the salaries of public servants and teachers, thoroughly eliminating corruption, cutting redundant organizations, and enhancing administrative efficiency are all urgent priorities. Time is pressing. Current policies must be implemented quickly and effectively. What is meant by "fast" is to do what is said. What is meant by "having a solution" is to do what is said. There must be no procrastination and no leaks. Those in power must not only be incorruptible officials but also capable officials, because the most pressing tasks are stability, stabilization, and tranquility. As for substituting fish for meat, planting vegetables on rooftops, and establishing advisory groups, those are secondary.</p>

<h3>United Nations General Assembly Adjourns: Issue of Former Italian Colonies to be Discussed at September Session</h3>
<p>[United Press Fuller's Xing, 18th] The United Nations General Assembly adjourned at 6:17 PM today.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, Fuller's Xing, 18th] The Third United Nations General Assembly adjourned tonight and will reconvene in the fall. At the close of this session, Secretary-General Trygve Lie told delegates: "The hope for peace has become brighter, and the strong belief in the United Nations is the strongest it has been in a long time." The Indonesian issue has been postponed for discussion to avoid affecting the ongoing Dutch-Indonesian negotiations in Batavia under the auspices of the United Nations. In addition, the draft convention on freedom of information was also postponed until the fall session, as there was insufficient time to discuss it during this session. The Fourth UN General Assembly is scheduled to open on September 20th.</p>
<p>[United Press Fuller's Xing, 18th] The United Nations concluded its Third General Assembly on the 18th. The 59-nation assembly today rejected the Bevin-Sforza proposal for the disposition of former Italian colonies. By a vote of 51 to zero, it resolved to postpone further discussion of the colonial issue to the Fourth General Assembly in September. As Assembly President Evatt prepared to adjourn the meeting, the Polish representative requested a debate on the case of German Communist Eisler, seeking UN intervention in his escape. Evatt denied permission, arguing that with the General Assembly about to adjourn, it was not practically possible to discuss the matter. The matter was put to a vote, upholding the Assembly President's ruling.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Rome, 18th] The United Nations General Assembly's rejection of the Bevin-Sforza plan for handling the former Italian colonies has greatly disappointed people here. While political figures hope for a more favorable solution for Italy when the issue is discussed at the next General Assembly, authorities here believe that the hostile attitude of some member states of the Assembly towards returning colonies to Italy is extremely serious. Italian newspapers have not commented on the matter.</p>
<p>[French News Agency London, 18th] British government officials here expressed regret over the United Nations General Assembly's rejection of the Bevin-Sforza plan, but a Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain is prepared to accept any solution passed by the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference: Tentative Agreement Expected; US, UK, and France Engaged in Secret Consultations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 19th] Well-informed sources said today that at the upcoming Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the US, UK, and France will establish a tentative agreement with the Soviet Union on the German question, without hoping for a permanent solution.</p>
<p>According to the planned proposal, a German Committee will be established as a liaison mechanism between the West German government and the East German People's Council to symbolize German unification, pending genuine cooperation between East and West. US Envoy Jessup and State Department Advisor Bohlen, British Foreign Office expert Sir Gilbert Laithwaite, and French Foreign Office Secretary-General Parodi have been engaged in secret consultations on this matter in recent days.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 18th] The representatives of the three powers continued their talks here today before the convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference to seek to unify the steps of the three Western countries in the Foreign Ministers' Conference. British Commander-in-Chief in Germany General Robertson and the advisor to the French Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Poncet, also participated in the talks.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Moscow, 19th] The Soviet delegation to the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference will include Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Forces in Germany Marshal Chuikov, and senior officials of the Soviet Foreign Ministry Smirnov and Podtserobov. Smirnov participated in the 1947 Moscow Conference and last year's Berlin problem delegation. There are also seven advisors, two experts, thirteen diplomats, and forty-six other personnel, for a total of more than seventy people. Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's wife and two journalists will also travel to Paris at the same time, and twelve secretaries have already flown from here to Paris.</p>
<p>[French News Agency London, 18th] It was announced here today that Foreign Minister Bevin will leave here on Friday for Paris to hold preliminary talks with French Foreign Minister Schuman and US Secretary of State Acheson before the convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Paris, 18th] Representatives and experts on German affairs from the UK, US, and France continued their preparatory meetings at the French Foreign Ministry this afternoon, but no information was released on the discussions.</p>
<h3>Canada Recognizes Israel</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Ottawa, 18th] It was announced here today that the Canadian government has formally recognized Israel. Canada had already given de facto recognition to Israel in December last year.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Restricts Cars from Entering Soviet Zone of Berlin</h3>
<p>US Believes It's Another Indirect Blockade</p>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 18th] The Soviet Union today restricted cars from entering Berlin and the Soviet zone. West Germans believe this is due to the devaluation of the Soviet zone Mark, and the US also believes this is an indirect blockade. At the same time, the four-power negotiations on easing trade and transportation seem to have broken down. All of this has occurred one week after the lifting of the Berlin Blockade. US Military Government transportation expert Dix has gone to Helmstedt to investigate the truth about 150 West German trucks being blocked at the Soviet border. According to official reports, Soviet soldiers suddenly demanded that all vehicles present permits issued by the East German Economic Commission, and the Soviets also demanded control over all exports from West Berlin. US officials say this is a sign that a subtle blockade has restarted, aimed at forcing the US, UK, and France to only maintain military delegations in Berlin, with all raw materials supplied by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union to Rejoin Allied Government of Berlin</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 18th] British officials here believe that the Soviet Union may soon return to the four-power Allied Military Government of Berlin. The Soviet Union withdrew from that body last summer. British officials expect that the first step the Soviet Union will take will be to send an observer to attend, but the personal attendance of Major General Kotikov, the Soviet Commander of the Berlin District, is also not impossible.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Emphasizes That Goodwill Cooperation Among Four Nations Is a Primary Condition for Peace; This Path of Cooperation Will Be Obtained at the Foreign Ministers Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters Moscow, 19th] The Moscow New Times weekly commented: Cooperation among the great powers is the primary condition for lasting peace, and the path to rebuilding this cooperation is now very clear. If the upcoming Foreign Ministers Conference on the German issue is to be successful, the Western countries must abandon their methods of intimidation and arbitrariness. The rapid drafting of the Bonn Constitution and the hasty establishment of a provisional West German government are quite suspicious. It should be known that similar attempts to create a fait accompli will not benefit their authors, because everyone in the world knows that no political or international problem can be solved by war. At the upcoming Foreign Ministers Conference, both sides must act in good faith. The Berlin problem is an integral part of the German problem, and the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements are the foundation for resolving the German problem. The Soviet Union has always believed that the Berlin and German problems must be resolved through four-power negotiations.</p>
<h3>Developments in the Current Situation in Asia Seriously Threaten World Peace; Acheson Tells Reporters That He Is Extremely Concerned About China</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Acheson stated at his weekly press briefing today that the United States is not currently considering joining a Pacific defense pact. However, he acknowledged that in the situation in Asia, there exists a serious danger to world peace. When reporters asked him to elaborate on the points of serious danger, Acheson said that his concerns were mainly centered around the troublesome situation in China.</p>
<p>Regarding the Pacific pact issue, he said, "I believe that those who have put forward this suggestion have probably not studied the evolution and development of the North Atlantic Treaty. The creation of the Atlantic Treaty was due to a series of circumstances unique to Europe and the Atlantic Treaty countries, so the treaty was a logical result of a series of developments." He said, "Although there is a serious danger to world peace existing in the situation in Asia, as Nehru said, a Pacific pact will be difficult to form until the existing disputes within Asia are resolved, due to these internal disputes. Therefore, the time is not yet ripe to organize a Pacific pact along the lines of the Atlantic Treaty." Acheson said that Nehru's views were an objective assessment of current practical possibilities.</p>
<h3>No Concessions Will Be Made on the West German Issue</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Acheson told reporters here today that the Western countries will not make any concessions on the West German issue at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. The Secretary of State insisted that the agreement between the UK, US, and France on Germany will not be the subject of dispute at the four-power Foreign Ministers Conference. He agreed with General Clay's statement yesterday, also advocating that the occupying forces should continue to be stationed in Germany. He said that the Soviet Union's willingness to negotiate is only intended to temporarily calm the Cold War. Acheson confirmed that he will immediately meet with the Foreign Ministers of the UK and France upon arriving in Paris to provide a comprehensive overview of various issues before the convening of the four-power Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>Korean Foreign and Defense Ministries Issue Statement Requesting US Military Aid, Alleging Soviet Union Is Arming North Korean Army and Air Force</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Seoul, 19th] The South Korean Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry issued a joint statement today, requesting active military aid from the United States. It is claimed that the Soviet Union has agreed to arm nine divisions of the North Korean army and loan North Korea 220 aircraft and 20 patrol boats. Currently, the strength of the North Korean army is approximately 200,000, while South Korea only has 50,000. The aid provided by the United States to South Korea should be at least equal to that provided by the Soviet Union to North Korea. South Korea should be adequately protected before US troops withdraw from South Korea.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Seoul, 19th] The Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea openly requested the United Nations Commission on Korea at a special press conference on the 19th to clarify its position on rumors that the commission was planning to negotiate Korean unification with the North Korean People's Government.</p>
<h3>Japanese Financial Difficulties Lead to Resignation of Over Two Thousand Mayors</h3>
<p>Two Village Chiefs Commit Suicide</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 19th] The Mainichi Shimbun reports that according to investigations, over two thousand mayors and leaders of Japan's 16,000 local governments have resigned one after another due to extreme financial difficulties. It is claimed that this is caused by the new financial measures for local governments to be self-sufficient, which is a serious blow to MacArthur Headquarters' promotion of developing local self-governing bodies to match Japan's democratization. The newspaper claims that two village chiefs in Okayama Prefecture in western Honshu committed suicide because they were unable to perform their duties. It also claims that one of the prominent reasons for the widespread resignation of local government leaders is their inability to meet public demands to establish a new school system with six years of elementary school, three years of middle school, and three years of high school.</p>
<h3>US Loses Uranium Block; Part of It Has Been Found</h3>
<p>This Mysterious Incident Is Gradually Subsiding</p>
<p>[French News Agency Washington, 18th] The Atomic Energy Commission issued a statement today stating that part of the thirty-two grams of Uranium-235 that was considered lost has been found in the laboratory's waste pile, so this "mysterious incident" that has caused people to feel extremely tense is gradually subsiding. The statement said that of the thirty-two grams of uranium that were lost, twenty-five grams have been found in the waste pile. The remaining seven grams may have been stolen or lost, and the federal police are continuing to search the waste pile.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Washington, 19th] Senator McMahon, Chairman of the Senate Atomic Energy Committee and a Democrat, claimed that the small amount of uranium lost from the atomic laboratory is of no value for manufacturing atomic weapons, and US security personnel do not believe this matter involves any espionage issues.</p>

<p>[Reuters London, 18th] The British House of Commons approved the Atlantic Pact, and the House of Lords also unanimously approved the pact today. During the debate, former Foreign Secretary and wartime Ambassador to the US, Lord Halifax, urged the government to carefully reconsider the Spanish question so as to jointly induce Spain and the world to return to a more realistic path with the United States. First Lord of the Admiralty Hall replied on behalf of the government, stating that if the United Nations organization recognizes the Franco regime or resolves to send an ambassador to Madrid, then Britain will certainly comply.</p>

<h3>Three-Team Soccer Game Held in the Rain: Tung Wah and Tsing Pak Draw Again</h3>
<p>The second act of the Three-Team Invitational Soccer Tournament, the match between Tung Wah and Tsing Pak, took place at Yi Garden yesterday at 4:30 PM. The weather was not cooperative in the afternoon, with drizzling rain, but about 2,000 fans still braved the rain to watch. The match proceeded as scheduled, but because the field was damp and Tung Wah only had ten players again, both sides agreed to change it to a friendly match. The result was a 1-1 draw. The match has been rescheduled for this weekend at 4:00 PM. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Xie Xichuan, Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Hannibal, Guan Yongchang</p>
<p>Li Yao, Gao Xiuqing, Han Longhai, Qian Jiuqing, Chen Mingzhe</p>
<p>Tsing Pak</p>
<p>Huang Shijie</p>
<p>Yan Shixin, Qiang Zhiyuan</p>
<p>Qian Changrong, Meng Yiliang, Fu Naidang</p>
<p>Jin Lusheng, Luo Shoufu, Liu Longxin, Liu Tiyin, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>The match began in the drizzling rain. Tung Wah kicked off, with Han Longhai passing the ball. Gao Xiuqing advanced past defenders, but Tsing Pak's Fu Naidang failed to intercept properly, leaving a big gap. Unfortunately, Longhai's shot was too weak and did not succeed. The game remained even until the seventh minute when Tsing Pak launched a full attack. Jin Lusheng went straight in along the side and lofted a high ball into the box. Liu Longxin swept across the field, and Tsing Pak opened the scoring. At that time, the rain intensified, and the water battle between the two sides became fierce. Tung Wah struggled to break through, and Han Longhai made two surprise attacks, but both were cleared by Yan Shixin. In the 27th minute, Tung Wah launched another attack. Wu Qixiang advanced, but Meng Yiliang made a desperate save, resulting in a corner kick. Soon after, Qiang Zhiyuan joined Tsing Pak, bringing the team to the full complement of players, and their momentum increased. Fei Chunhua launched a sneak attack, but Luo Shoufu was unable to react in time, missing a good opportunity. The first half ended with Tsing Pak in the lead.</p>
<p>In the second half, Tung Wah still had only ten players, but their morale was not diminished. In the third minute, Tung Wah's Li Yao made a clever pass to Gao Xiuqing, who sprinted forward. Meng Yiliang handled the ball in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Gao Xiuqing took the penalty, but missed. Tsing Pak seized the opportunity to attack, with Liu Tiyin and Liu Longxin attacking together, but Tung Wah's Hannibal cleared the danger. In the 19th minute, Tung Wah launched a comeback, with Li Yao and Gao Xiuqing pressing Tsing Pak closely. Qiang Zhiyuan became distracted and committed a handball foul, resulting in a penalty kick for Tung Wah. Han Longhai took the penalty and scored, tying the game at 1-1. After that, the two sides engaged in a fierce battle, with each team fighting for possession. Tung Wah was unwilling to be outdone, and Wu Qixiang once unleashed a powerful shot that was only inches from the post, giving Huang Shijie a scare. In the final three minutes, Tsing Pak's Jin Lusheng and Fei Chunhua attacked on both wings, and Tung Wah's defense suddenly became critical. Jin Lusheng went past Guan Yongchang and fired a powerful shot from close range, but Zhang Banglun made a save to clear the danger. Shortly afterward, time ran out, and each team had scored one goal, resulting in a satisfactory draw for both sides.</p>

<h3>The True Picture of Peace in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Continued from the first page of May 17)</p>
<p>(7) Celebrating "Liberation"</p>
<p>The Thirteen Articles of Peace were announced on the 22nd. On that day, the people of Beiping celebrated wildly from south to north, as mentioned above. Starting from the 24th, the pressure of prices increased day by day, robberies continued to occur, workers of various agencies demanded wages in groups, gangsters extorted money, the Secretary-General of the government Gao Wenbo was beaten, and Mayor Liu Yaozhang's home was robbed, barely escaping with his life. Workers of the tram company demanded 50,000 big heads within three days, otherwise they would set fire to the building. A series of threatening facts are too numerous to mention. As a result, the smiles of the people of Beiping disappeared, and most people returned to their original sophistication. During this period, although art troupes with men and women were always dancing the Yangko with three steps forward and one step back, singing "The East is Red, the sun rises, China produced Mao Zedong" at any time and place on the streets, most people appreciated it with the mood of watching monkeys, and it did not affect their emotions at all. February 1 finally arrived, and the joint organization announced its establishment, but it was silent and had no effect. Some people woke up from their dreams, and most people were still disappointed. Details will be described later.</p>
<p>On February 2, the Beiping Municipal People's Government received the "pseudo-municipal government" according to the People's Daily. Although Ye Jianying repeatedly emphasized in his speech that this was the establishment of the people's own government, which was completely different from the two previous transfers to He Siyuan and Liu Yaozhang, the people of Beiping believed that not a single person was elected by more than 2 million citizens, and Ye Jianying was the mayor. Now they say it is their own government, which is really a bit beyond their reach, especially since various threats have increased day by day due to the establishment of their own government. Therefore, although the municipal government staff gave a reluctant smile during the hearing, it was a bitter smile, a perfunctory smile, not a real smile.</p>
<p>On February 3, the night before the People's Liberation Army held the ceremony for entering Beiping, the Baojia chiefs ordered each household to send one person to gather at the Guangchang inside Qianmen to prepare for the welcome. Roll call would also be taken at that time. With guns in their hands, who would dare not go! Moreover, the people of Beiping had never seen what the People's Liberation Army was like. If you pulled a southern water buffalo on the street, many people would watch, let alone the People's Liberation Army who had been admired for a long time? Therefore, that day was really crowded with people, filling the streets. The American journalist Mu _, Ji Ang believed that the people of Beiping welcomed the People's Liberation Army with the mood of being conquered, which was indeed an insult to the people of Beiping. In fact, Beiping has been the capital since the Liao Dynasty, with thousands of years of history and nearly ten dynastic changes. Due to the tempering of history, the residents are sophisticated and more like British gentlemen. Except for the moment of life and death, they have never regarded themselves as characters on the stage. Therefore, this time welcoming the People's Liberation Army is more like watching than welcoming. It is better to say that they ran a cameo role themselves than to say that they watched a ceremony. However, this only refers to the real people. As for the art troupes formed by various communist parties, that is another matter.</p>
<p>This drama was performed as follows: The protagonist, the People's Liberation Army, entered the city in two ways at 10:00 AM. One way came from Fengtai and entered the city through Yong'anmen, and the other way came from Haidian and entered the city through Xizhimen. After converging, they turned south and went west from West Chang'an Street through Hepingmen to Guang'anmen. The grand procession lasted from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The front team had already exited Hepingmen, and the rear team was still crowding towards Yongdingmen and Xizhimen. Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan, Nie Rongzhen, and Ye Jianying appeared on the Qianmen arrow tower at 9:30 AM with the smiles of victors. In this entry ceremony, the so-called Tower Hill Heroic Team led the way into Xizhimen, and the so-called Storm Team led the way into Yongdingmen. I went to visit outside Qianmen. At about 11:00 AM, the so-called Storm Team leading the way arrived at Zhushikou. The team was led by an armored vehicle, with one person waving a yellow axe and sickle and a red Soviet flag as a guide, followed by four red trucks with portraits of Mao Zedong and Zhu De and Soviet flags everywhere. The trucks were full of music teams, playing international songs very harshly. Behind them were armored vehicle teams, artillery teams, and tank teams. Each vehicle was decorated with a bright and eye-catching large Soviet flag, followed by cavalry and infantry. The uniforms of the officers and soldiers were all khaki, the same as the National Army, except that there was a missing national emblem on the hat. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Twenty Passenger Planes Fly South Daily: Still Difficult to Meet Passenger Needs</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The battle to defend Shanghai has entered a climax, and the number of people leaving Shanghai has increased sharply in recent days, especially with extremely crowded passengers in the two airlines. From morning to night, Longhua Airport is crowded with people, and boxes and luggage are piled up in the waiting room, creating a chaotic scene. Evacuation passenger planes all fly in from South China, arriving and departing at any time, with no fixed schedule. Some passengers, after arriving at the airport in the early morning, often have to wait until evening before they can take off, and their anxiety is evident in their expressions. Some people who carry silver dollars out of the country are eager to exchange them for US dollars due to weight restrictions, exchanging eleven big heads for ten US dollars. Yesterday, China Airlines flew out 14 passenger planes, and Central Airlines flew out 6 passenger planes. The two companies have been flying about 20 flights a day for the past few days, carrying an average of about 600 to 800 passengers per day, which is still not enough to meet the needs. Therefore, the black market for plane tickets is extremely rampant, about three to four times higher than the normal fare. For example, the fare from Shanghai to Hong Kong is 380 million yuan, but a black market ticket costs more than 100 US dollars.</p>
<p>[Reuters Karachi, 18th] British Overseas Airways Corporation Southeast Asia Headquarters announced here today that the company's Hong Kong Airlines Shanghai-Hong Kong route has been suspended indefinitely from today.</p>
<h3>Northwest Airlines Special Flight Canceled</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to Northwest Airlines, the company's special flight originally scheduled to come to Shanghai from Manila today to pick up passengers to fly to Tokyo and transfer to the United States has been canceled. The reason is due to the development of the war and concerns for the safety of passengers.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Formulates Five Measures for Workers' Living Expenses</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau is checking the provisions of Article 7 of the "Provisional Guidelines for the Calculation of Salaries of Shanghai Employees in Extraordinary Times," and the minimum living expenses for workers during factory shutdowns or reduced work hours will be determined separately. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the situation in various factories in the city is different. If uniform regulations are made, it may cause disputes. The bureau yesterday formulated five more flexible measures: (1) The minimum living expenses for workers during shutdowns or reduced work hours should be based on self-negotiation between labor and management. (2) Refer to Article 1 of the "Measures for the Payment of Living Expenses to Workers During Temporary Factory Shutdowns" of the Labor-Management Assessment Committee (if the factory is suddenly shut down due to force majeure, the living expenses for up to ten days will be paid at half of the original wages, and for more than ten days but less than one month, the living expenses will be paid at one-quarter of the original wages). (3) The calculation of living expenses should be in accordance with Article 1 of the "Provisional Guidelines for the Calculation of Salaries of Shanghai Employees in Extraordinary Times." The payment of living expenses should also be handled in accordance with Articles 4, 5, and 6 of the "Implementation Guidelines" of the same measures. (4) If there is no fixed basic salary for piecework, it should be calculated based on the average of the actual work income for the last three months and handled in accordance with the second type of regulations. (5) If labor and management fail to reach an agreement, they should submit it to the bureau for approval. The above measures will be reported by the Social Affairs Bureau to the Municipal Government and the Political Affairs Committee of the Garrison Headquarters for record and notified to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, and the General Labor Union for implementation.</p>
<h3>Gold Bonds: Issuance Suspended</h3>
<p>After the suspension of trading on the exchange, the gold bonds issued by the Central Bank have been extremely sluggish in the market. The convenience for people in various industries to use them for circulating funds has been lost. Moreover, compared with the trend of the gold market, the price is far behind. Therefore, the Central Bank decided yesterday to suspend the issuance of gold bonds from now on. At the same time, the Foundation is also in the process of closing down.</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Price: National Bank Posted Yesterday; 9.6 Million Gold Yuan Coupons per Coin</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The price of silver dollars was officially posted by the Central Bank at about 10:00 AM yesterday at 9.6 million gold yuan coupons per coin.</p>
<p>The Central Bank also issued the following news release for the silver dollar posting: It has been decided by the Political Affairs Committee of the Jing-Hu-Hang Garrison Headquarters that the Central Bank will post the price every day, and all exchange shops holding silver dollar exchange licenses should operate according to the Central Bank's posted price. The transaction fee is approximately 2% of the posted price. The selling price should not be more than 200,000 yuan higher than the posted price. The buying price should not be more than 200,000 yuan lower than the posted price. For example, if the Central Bank's posted price on May 19, 1938, is 9.6 million gold yuan coupons per silver dollar, the price for an exchange shop to sell one silver dollar should not exceed 9.8 million yuan, and the price for buying one silver dollar should not be less than 9.4 million yuan. The fee will be re-regulated when it must be changed in the future. This measure has been strictly implemented by the Police Department, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Gold Control Bureau by order of the Jing-Hu-Hang Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank's posted price was still far from the black market, so the buying and selling of general stores was still at a standstill. A few shops posted 9.0 million to buy and 10.5 million to sell, but when asked to buy from them, they replied that there was no incoming inventory. The whereabouts of silver dollar dealers on the road were erratic, and the market was chaotic and inconsistent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rate of gold and silver was stable, with the exchange of different types of goods at 44/47, the exchange of one type of goods at 43/46, the exchange of two types of goods at 45/48, and the exchange of foreign silver dollars at 48/53, with some at 47/52. The exchange of gold and banknotes was still at 50 yuan and 53 yuan. The exchange of banknotes and silver shrank by another 20%, and the US dollar has been gradually lagging behind, with the exchange of one type of goods at 8.3 yuan and 8.8 yuan, the exchange of two types of goods at 8.7 yuan and 9.2 yuan, and the exchange of different types of goods at 8.5 yuan and 9.0 yuan. However, foreign silver dollars were still stable, still at 9.5 yuan and 10 yuan. The market for exchanging jewelry gold for silver dollars was stable, and stores posted foreign silver dollars at 48 and 53, and factory bars plus 2 yuan, at 50 yuan and 55 yuan.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the silver coin market was still popular. Because the price of gold and banknotes was not low, more people were buying than selling. The 20-cent coin rose to 400,000 to 500,000, the 10-cent coin rose to 200,000 to 250,000, and the 5-cent coin was also quoted as high as 100,000 to 150,000, an increase of 50,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>National Bank Determines Proportional Distribution of Silver Dollars for Deposits in Banks and Money Shops</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank yesterday resumed the method of distributing silver dollars for depositors who withdrew deposits from various banks and money shops. The distribution ratio is 10% silver dollars, 20% silver coins, 10% fixed-amount promissory notes, and 60% cash.</p>
<p>Recently, the Central Bank has been supplying as much cash as possible to various banks, bureaus, and commercial firms for the balance of deposits every other day, and also distributing fixed-amount promissory notes and silver coins to meet actual needs. However, the total amount of deposits that various banks, bureaus, and commercial firms have to pay is much larger than the funds deposited in the Central Bank, so they cannot pay depositors according to the percentage of silver coins issued by the Central Bank, which has caused many misunderstandings in the outside world.</p>
<p>Inventory of Silver Coins to be Reported for Record</p>
<p>It is learned that in order to take into account the facts, the Appropriation Committee of the Central Bank has stipulated that from now on, various banks, bureaus, and commercial firms should report the total amount of deposits and the amount of silver coins in their inventory to the Central Bank for record at the end of each business day. The payment of deposits on the next day will be based on the ratio of the silver coins in the inventory on the previous day, plus the number of silver coins that can be obtained from the Central Bank on the same day, to the total amount of deposits as the composition of the distribution of silver coins. If it is less than one silver coin, it will be paid in gold yuan coupons, and it will be publicly displayed outside the business counter for public knowledge. The Central Bank has notified the Silver Industry Association to inform various banks and money shops to follow this measure. It is also learned that banks and money shops must not violate the above measures under any pretext. The Shanghai Gold Control Bureau is closely monitoring the distribution of silver dollars to various banks and money shops by the Central Bank at any time. If there is any illegal profiteering, in addition to being ordered to allocate the full amount, the Jing-Hu-Hang Garrison Headquarters will also investigate.</p>
<h3>Public and Education Salaries and Allowances: Approved to Distribute Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that public and education personnel are allowed to distribute a portion of silver dollars based on the market price of the day when paying salaries and allowances. The ratio will be determined by the Central Bank based on the actual situation.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Increasingly Active</h3>
<p>Silver Shops Still Not Posting Gold Prices</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market was extremely active due to rising gold prices reported from other cities, diverging greatly from the local market. People's confidence was strong, and with various favorable conditions, there was much positive sentiment. As usual, prices hit the upper limit, rising again to 6.636 billion, but with transactions scarce. Outside the exchange, the atmosphere was fervent, with peaks appearing one after another, and buying enthusiasm pervading. The morning opened at 6.3 billion, then 6.6 billion, and then surpassed the 7 billion mark, reaching as high as 7.2 billion and 7.5 billion. Around noon, due to the central bank not selling, the upward trend intensified, reaching a peak of 7.4 billion and 7.7 billion. The noon close was slightly lower at 7.1 billion and 7.4 billion. In the afternoon, due to heavy pressure from the authorities, sentiment softened, and prices once fell back to 6.8 billion and 7.1 billion, finally closing at 7 billion and 7.3 billion, an increase of another 1 billion compared to the previous day's result.</p>
<p>The off-exchange US dollar also rose step by step. The morning opened at 12.2 million and 12.7 million, once reaching as high as 14.8 million and 15.3 million. The noon close was 14 million and 14.5 million. In the afternoon, due to more floating supply, prices fell to 13.3 million and 13.8 million, finally closing at 13.5 million and 14 million, a further increase of 1 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silver shops still did not post prices for gold jewelry. According to Wu Pengnian, Chairman of the Silver Shops Association, the members of the association are experiencing sluggish business, with daily transactions of only about four or five taels, which is not enough to cover the large overhead expenses. Moreover, with gold prices rising daily, business is difficult. However, once the situation improves, they will be able to resume posting prices and trading at any time.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Excessively, Police Monitor the Market, Cooking Oil Stagnant</h3>
<p>Under the leadership of the gold price surge, rice prices rose again. Furthermore, with the supply cut off and inventory dwindling, the price increase was particularly intense. In the North City market, white japonica rice, thin-husk rice, and Xiang rice all approached the 90 million mark, a sharp increase of 16 million, or more than 20%, compared to two days ago. In the South City market, white japonica rice was 88 million and thin-husk rice was 89 million, also an increase of 16 million each. Due to the excessive price increases in recent days, economic police officers were secretly monitoring transactions in the market yesterday.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Transactions were sluggish. Due to the high price of side dishes, soybeans sold exceptionally well on this street. Pinghu soybeans rose more than 10 million, and mung beans were also selling. Pudong vegetable mung beans were at 60 million. Although corn did not rise much, sesame seeds and peeled peanuts did not open for trading.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Market sentiment fluctuated, but compared to gold and silver, it was generally firm. Old vehicle flour was trading at 18 million today. The warship flour opened higher in the morning, but buying interest weakened midway, and it fell to 15 million at one point. At the close, retail investors bought on the dip, bringing it back to 15.56 million. Red Bee and Dafa were stable. Lilang foreign flour opened at 27.6 million in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices High, Fabric Market Stalls</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was ordinary yesterday, and sentiment was scattered. It was heard that prices in Guizhou and other places had fallen, so sales to the south became sluggish. However, due to the continued rise of financial assets outside the industry, although buying interest in coarse and fine yarn was weak, prices still rose. 42-count Blue Phoenix saw 255 million, up 48 million. 40-count and 32-count yarns each rose by about 400 million. 21-count Double Horse spot goods were trading at 161 million, up 32 million. 20-count yarns of various grades rose by 15 million to 30 million each. 16-count and below rose by 15 million to 30 million each.</p>
<p>The cotton fabric market was in a state of stagnation.</p>

<h3>The Battle to Defend Shanghai Unfolds, Kuomintang Members Rise Up in Time, Chairman Fang Issues Letter to All City Party Members</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] In view of the unfolding battle to defend Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang believes that party members should rise up in time and strive to defend Shanghai. Chairman Fang has issued a letter to all city party members, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>To all comrades in the city: Since the communists have used all their strength to invade this city, the Battle of Shanghai has entered its climax. Due to the strong morale of our front-line soldiers and the dedication of the three armies, the communists have suffered a serious blow over the past week and have achieved initial victories. This association, considering that our party comrades have always been influenced by the Three Principles of the People and take saving the country and the people as their responsibility, should take this extraordinary period as an opportunity to strengthen themselves, strive to be the first to go to the front lines, set an example for the people, and work together to defend Shanghai. Therefore, the following points are presented to all comrades in the city:</p>
<p>(1) Rescuing the Wounded: At the front lines, the war is fierce, and our brave soldiers are fighting valiantly and fearlessly. We should organize comrades and mobilize the people to quickly launch rescue work for those brave soldiers who are wounded or become ill while defending the country, so that the wounded soldiers can receive medical treatment as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Eliminating Traitors and Clearing Out Spies: At a time when the front-line defense war is becoming increasingly fierce, it is inevitable that there are criminals and communist spies hiding in our city's suburbs, plotting to create disturbances and seizing opportunities for mischief in order to cooperate with the communist military offensive. In order to consolidate public security and resolutely defend Shanghai, all our comrades should secretly investigate and strictly report them, and be sure to thoroughly eliminate them in order to quell the source of the chaos and ensure safety.</p>
<p>(3) Consoling the Soldiers: Our front-line soldiers are fighting bloody battles, not only working hard for the country, but also enduring all kinds of hardships. Therefore, how to comfort the soldiers is an urgent matter. All our comrades should mobilize the citizens of the city to launch a large-scale and widespread fundraising campaign to comfort the soldiers, thereby encouraging morale and increasing the soldiers' determination to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>(4) Relieving Refugees: The outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai has directly affected our compatriots in the suburbs, who have been rendered homeless, stranded on the streets, without clothing or food, and in a very miserable situation. In addition to extending our warm sympathy to them, we should also actively launch fundraising efforts and find ways to provide relief to demonstrate the spirit of service of our party comrades.</p>
<p>The above points are just a few of the most urgent matters to be addressed. As for other actions to be coordinated with the military, such as wartime tasks such as guides, reconnaissance, and transportation, all require party comrades to promptly implement them, take action, adhere to the belief of certain victory, endure the current hardships, and go all out to win the final victory in the defense war. The matter is urgent, and time is pressing. All our comrades in the city should consider the difficulties of the party and the country, quickly rise up and work to save the party, save the country, save the people, and save themselves. This is the time! Let us encourage each other. Printed by the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China.</p>
<h3>Anti-Communist and Bandit Suppression Slogans to Save the Nation</h3>
<p>Made by the Political Affairs Committee of the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>(1) The Communist bandits are lackeys of red imperialism</p>
<p>(2) The Communist bandits are traitors selling out the country</p>
<p>(3) The anti-communist war is a war for survival against coercion and enslavement</p>
<p>(4) The anti-communist war is a war of self-defense against robbery and invasion</p>
<p>(5) The anti-communist war is a patriotic war to fight for national independence and people's freedom</p>
<p>(6) Everyone is responsible for suppressing communist bandits</p>
<p>(7) Eliminate communist spies</p>
<p>(8) Comfort the national army and rescue the sick and wounded</p>
<p>(9) Only fighting desperately can save your life</p>
<p>(10) Shanghai's six million citizens mobilize to defend greater Shanghai</p>
