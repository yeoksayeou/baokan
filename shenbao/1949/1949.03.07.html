<h3>南京救國日報　被罰停刊三天　龔德柏受嚴重警告後開釋</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕南京救國日報以兩篇社論幾罹大禍，五日午夜該報被治安機關查封，社長龔德柏亦被傳訊，但至六日晚復經決定啓封，其處分僅爲停刊三天，龔本人則於受「嚴重警告」後釋出。救國日報爲龔德柏所主辦，其言論向以「大砲」著名，四日·五日接連兩日發表社論，題爲「人民要求政局明朗了」，及「蔣公不出國中國無救」，內容激烈，當局頗爲不滿，五日晚十一時，首都衛戌總部會同警憲當局，派員查封該報，先赴龔之住宅說明當局傳訊襲氏之理由，龔氏當卽遵命隨往，旋赴救國日報社查封，執行時極爲客氣，對該報社同仁秋亳無犯，僅將機器房，排字房等部門封訖，至六日上午三時始執行竣事。查封時，該報編輯部正照常工作，至是乃告停頓，六日該報遂未出版。按救國日報四日社論「人民要求政局明朗了」一文中，係指責造成今日嚴重局面之責任爲蔣總統，而引退後復「在幕後操縱政治軍事」。五日社論「蔣公不出國，中國無救」一文中，更謂與共黨談和，非蔣總統出國不可，若繼續作戰，亦只有蔣總統出國，始可獲得美援。兩文中並涉及東北·徐州兩役失利，限價政策失敗及李代總統僅負虛名等問題。衛戌總部以該報此種言論不知何所根據，故將龔氏傳訊，六日晚經向上峯請示後，決定該報以言論失檢，應予停刋三天，社長龔德柏則受嚴重警告，龔氏在衛戍總部中羈留不及廿小時，當晚巳返寓所。</p>
<h3>首都衛戌總司令　張耀明發表談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕首都衛戍總司令張耀明氏對五日晚奉諭處分救國日報並傳詢該報發行人龔德柏事，特發表談話如下：（一）救國日報本月四日社論，「人民要求政局明朗了」及五日社論「蔣公不出國·中國無救」兩文中，誣蔑領導完成北伐·領導抗戰勝利，並爲謀取和平而身先引退的蔣總統，侮辱臨危受命爲和平作最大努力的李代總統，誣責殉國與現役高級將領，更製造謠言，挑撥引退的蔣總統與李代總統間的感情，陰謀破壞團結，鼓動政潮，增添政府西難，阻碍和平進行，並以危言聲聽，企圖以人心紛亂，上下解體，陷於和戰兩難之局，此種毒辣陰謀，實屬危害整個國家民族。該報兩日社論發表後，首都軍民羣情憤激，本部迭據報告，有多人欲直接對該報採取行動，本部負責首都治安，不能坐視該報肆意鼓煽挑撥，而使首都引起騷動，故遵諭依照嚴法第十一條予該報以暫行封閉之處分。（二）該報四日社論蔣總統「違反東北將領全體之意見，使整個精銳軍全軍覆沒」，「他仍然發號施令」，並且要對付桂系。「在南京城內亦有一敵人」，「漢口又有一敵人，各省之敵，又不知若干人」。又說李代總統是「這種傀儡」以及五日社論「但蔣氏則躱在幕後支配一切」，「這兩個月的大好光陰，給我們凖備者皆爲蔣氏之勾心鬥角完全消失了」，凡此種種，究竟何所根據，有何憑證，均有詢問該社發行人龔德穩柏之必要，故予傳詢，俾明究竟，一俟詢明，卽行請示上峯核辦。</p>

<h3>港商與華北貿易</h3>
<p>— 本報駐港記者　子健</p>
<p>香港商人有一句很漂亮的口號，叫做「在商言商」。在這個口號的前提下，他們當前最急迫的一着棋，就是進行恢復香港與華北方面的商務。經過兩二三個月的凖備和籌劃，這一着棋現在已由理想而變成事實了。</p>
<p>港府發言人三月一日正式宣佈港府並不阻止船隻開往中國共黨治下的港口後，原定三日開往南韓仁川的太古輪「漢陽」號，便開始接儎運往天津的貨物，改期五日出發，打算先駛塘沽，然後轉赴南韓，這是港津正式試航的第一艘船隻。這個消息傳出後，該輪立刻收到二千噸左右的貨物，每噸運費港幣一百五十元。該船公司聲明，假如那些貨物不能在塘沽起卸，便改在仁川起卸，商人也無異議。</p>
<p>據記者調查所得：漢陽輸所載的，以新聞紙，樹膠，西藥，五金，顏料爲最多，另有一部份交通器材。聽說新聞紙的項目內，包括有最近中共派人在港搜購一空的八十磅桃林紙，那是趕運到北平去作印製「華北人民」鈔票之用的。最近駛往北韓去的巴拿馬旗商輪格林拿號也載去這種紙張一大批。</p>
<p>這兩天，港報上刊出了一個廣告說：「茲有中立國新輪定於三月十日開往天津，承裝客貨」，那些「在商言商」的人物，竟高舉「中立國」的招牌，他們的「邏輯」眞是不可思議！</p>
<p>香港和中共治下的區域通商，不自今日始，而香港對北韓的貿易，實已開其端。香港與北韓的鎭南浦間，經常有蘇輸葡輸和巴拿馬輪往來。據葡輸「華中號」的船長說，他的輸船到北韓去甚有所獲，最近載去西藥，紙張和工業器材三百噸，交換得到一千多噸的鬃毛和大豆（那都是東北的名產）。去冬有一艘蘇輸，載了三千多，噸的東北大豆來香港，交換汽車零件膠輪等等剛剛進入港口，却給一艘較大的英國貨輪撞沉海底去。據一位商人告訴記者：三個月前，有人租了一艘只重六七百噸的貨輪，載了一批貨物，冒險駛到靠近北韓的東北安東，換回大批大豆和猪鬃馬鬃，獲利四倍，有一個商人說：儘管香港與華北恢復通商的間題還有若千政治上外交上的葛藤，尚待解決，但中共需要香港供給的物資比香港需要東北華北的原料尤甚，這個生意的前途，無論如何，總是有希望的。</p>
<p>除了華北市塲外，港商的眼光，最近又注射到港口，港台，港梧的「新大陸」，試分別略說幾句：自一九四七年起，「日本貨」已捲土重來，充斥本港市塲。但那是由港府官方和東京盟軍。部洽辦的，最近麥克阿瑟將軍爲獎勵日貨找尋海外市塲，歡迎各國商人直接來日採購。港商認爲時機已至，紛作東遊之想。中國航空公司看中他們的需要，及時組織訪日旅行團，第一批載去了廿多人，第二批又將束裝就道了。</p>
<p>正當港商赴日的途中，合灣鑛業放察團翩然蒞港，商談促進台港貿易的道理。他們打算以合煤交換英國工開鑛器材及其他工業原料，港商也很高興。</p>
<p>行政院最近在廣州宣佈開放梧州，准許外國商船上溯西江，恢復廣西的對外貿易。戰後收回的內河航權，現又輕輕的退讓出來。港商藉外國船隻的便利，快要開拓一個市塲。梧州土產過去須經廣州出口，將可省了這個轉折。這在港商看來是「利」，在粵商看來却是「害」，利害衝突，因此粵商通電反對政府開放珠江，指摘那是重蹈「淸廷糧轍」！</p>
<p>港商乘滬商陷入內戰的泥淖中，不特有囊括遠東貿易的企圖，還想爭取歐洲市塲。去年看幾個單位參加英國工業，頗有「苗頭」。今年又抱很大雄心，再去倫敦「敲門」。這一點，在商言商，倒是不錯的。</p>

<h3>社論　蘇聯外交將轉變乎？</h3>
<p>莫斯科廣播電台四日宣佈：外長莫洛托夫巳被免職，遺缺由外次維辛斯基繼任；對外貿易部長米高揚亦同時免職，遺缺由孟許柯夫繼任。同時，蘇聯駐美大使葛羅米柯，則升任外次，以補維辛斯基之缺。這個蘇聯內閣人事重大更迭的消息傳出之後，不啻向世界各國投出一個炸彈，撼動了整個地球，使每一個人的心中，都發生了一連串的嚴重問題：「克林姆宮現在究將如何？」「蘇聯的對外政策會不會變更？」倫教華府迄今還抱着靜觀的態度，一般觀察家也不敢輕下斷語。但由我們看來，莫洛托夫自一九三九繼李維諾夫出任外長以還，巳逾十年之久，現今一旦去職，無論如何，當有其深刻的意義。蘇聯今後的對外政策，其勢或將有所改變乎？</p>
<p>凡是研究蘇聯外交政策的人，都承認蘇聯在最近三十年來所採取的外交政策，可以分爲三個階段。從蘇聯社會革命成功建立蘇維埃政府之日起，到一九三〇年齊吉林外長辭職之日爲止，這是蘇聯外交的第一個階段。那時的蘇聯是被遺棄在國際社會之外的，一方面資本主義國家視新興的蘇聯爲洪水猛默，到處要防範她，赤化全世界的企圖，甚至列强聯合進攻蘇聯之說，也會盛傳於一時。另一方面，蘇聯也高唱着「世界革命」的理諭，企圖領導全世界被壓迫的弱小民族一致起來反對帝國主義。當時列寗也會說過這樣的一句話：「社會主義國家與資本生義國家，是絕對不能同時並存的，不是我們赤化全世界，競是社會主義國家被資本主義國家所瓜分。」</p>
<p>但至一九三〇年李維諾夫繼齊吉林爲外長之後，蘇聯的對外政策，就發生一百八十度的轉變，不僅放棄世界革命的主張，而且公然以「和平外交政策」相號召，李維諾夫運用其靈活的外交手腕，在數年之間，就獲得驚人的成功，不但與資本主義各國先後恢復邦交，而且與法國·捷克·波蘭·芬蘭暨波羅的海沿岸各國，締結互不侵犯條約及互助公約。一九三四年九月蘇聯加入國際聯盟，李維諾夫踏入國聯的大會堂，曾獲得世界各國代表的熱烈歡迎，儼然成「和平天使」。他首先提出「和平不可分割」的口號，至今猶爲一般人頌爲金科玉律。但至一九三九年李維諾夫突然免職，由莫洛托夫繼任，使蘇聯外交步入了第三階段。</p>
<p>在英洛托夫出任外長之初，蘇聯當局雖也一再矢口否認對外政策將有所變更；但客觀的事實却證明蘇聯已放棄了和平外交政策，而改採「現實主義」的外交政策了。一九三九年八月二十四日德蘇互不侵犯條約的簽訂，就是一個絕好的證明。後來第二次大戰爆發，莫洛托夫報告國際局勢，曾謂「現行大戰具有帝國生義者混戰的性質」，而認爲有利於蘇聯所領導的社會革命，直到德軍移師東征，由波蘭侵入蘇聯境內，才恍然大悟，第二次大戰是侵略者與反侵略者的戰爭，蘇聯只有與聯合國通力合作駢肩作戰爭取勝利，始能打倒侵略者。莫洛托夫在大戰期，對於加强聯合國之間的團結與合作，雖然也有很大的貢獻，但至大戰勝利結束之後，對於一個世界的分裂及美蘇的分道揚鑣而去，也不能不負相當的責任。時至今日，美蘇從事冷戰，愈演愈烈，使國際間充滿了戾氣，一步步走向新的國際戰爭。第三次大戰的危機旣迫於眉睫，美國自不得不在外交上採取主動。援歐計劃的積極實施，區域安全機構的竭力鼓吹，以及最近大西洋公約的商訂，表面上是爲了和平，實際上還不是針對蘇聯？再加以挪威的拒不與蘇聯締結互不侵犯條約，而堅欲加入大西洋公約，丹麥也有同樣的傾向。此更足以說明莫洛托未在歐洲的失敗。在此情况之下，蘇聯外交將有改變，似乎也就成了勢所必至的趨向。莫洛托夫的免職，或即是蘇聯外交改弦易轍的預兆。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫去職的傳設，由來已久，且時有所聞；莫氏與史太林氏意見的相左，也爲一般傳述之詞。惟因我們在鐵幕之外，不十分詳細知道蘇聯的政情，所以也不敢妄加猜測。現在莫氏去職，自有充分理由可以相信，蘇聯外交在維辛斯基就任之後，就更可以在史太林氏大權獨攬之下一元化了。維辛斯基是莫洛托夫的有力助手，在聯合國會議中時常「舌戰羣儒」，鋒鋩畢露，連西方各國的人士也欽佩他的本領；但是他對於蘇聯的外交政策，沒有主見，更沒有抱負，今後唯有以史太林氏的意見爲意見了。史太林氏的和平攻勢雖沒有成功，但今後在某一時期以內仍將由維辛斯基去加强發動，是可以推測而知的。</p>
<h3>海軍總部派飛機　沿海偵察重慶艦　官兵待遇低爲出走主因</h3>
<p>桂永清氏談話</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕重慶號軍艦失蹤後，海軍總部方面已獲得部份資料，現正派出飛機飛往沿海上空巡察。六日晨，桂永淸總司令對記者談：該艦出走時，艦上裝戰官兵約四五百人；出走原因之一，爲艦上官兵不滿過低之待過，蓋渠等在英受訓時，均支取英鎊，返國照公敎軍人待過，生活艱苦，該艦出走消息傳出時，渠正在安慶，原擬卽返上海，因公務覊身，未克返滬，最近渠曾利用無綫電向該艦官兵以英語廣播，請渠等莫作歷史上莫大之錯誤，以貽笑中外，一切間題均可予商量。廣播後，迄未接獲該鑑之答覆。渠並稱：一切軍艦無海總之命令，原不准自由移動者，該艦艦長可能假借命令，或藉訓練軍隊爲理由，離去吳淞口。記者詢以該艦有無回來可能時，桂氏答稱：現尚未陷於絕望之境。記者復以「因該艦之出走所能引起之後果如何」爲詢，桂氏未予置答。</p>
<p>傳已駛抵大連</p>
<p>〔路透社南京六日電〕海軍第二艦隊發言人在鎭江告本社稱：重慶號巡洋艦出走後，於在烟台添加燃料後，刻已抵達大連。同時，海軍總司令桂永淸在京向記者稱：重慶號於一週前潛逃出長江口時，故意來往駛行，似在試驗引擎然者，以避免海岸砲台之注意，迨駛抵砲台射程以外時，卽加速北駛，逃入公海</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京六日電〕海軍巡洋艦重慶號失蹤之迷，六日仍在撲朔迷離之中，前傳該艦已北駛烟台，投降中共之語，殊難證實，因政府偵察機曾兩度赴烟台上空偵察，但均未發現該艦。</p>

<h3>蘇最高決策操於政治局　基本政策不致變更　葛羅米哥昇任首席外次</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科五日電〕莫斯科電台宣布：蘇聯部長會議今日任命葛羅米柯爲外交部首席次長，以繼維辛斯基昇任外長後所遺之職務。按蘇聯其他外次現爲佐寗·戈賽夫及馬立克等。葛羅米柯亦如維辛斯基之端賴其在聯合國會議中發表之演說，而引起世人之注意。葛羅米柯於一九四三年入月繼李維諾夫後出任駐美大使，直至一九四六年四月爲止。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕此間人土金信蘇聯外交部長之更易，不過爲蘇政府內部的單純改組，不足被視爲驚人的免職事件。外交部發言人拒絕發表任何官方意見，然據本社外交記者稱，英官方對於此事尙不欲遠而斷定莫洛托夫之係遭革職，或蘇聯的外交政策卽將有基本的改變。就對我貿易部長米高揚之於同時雲職觀，可見此兩蘇聯前輩政治家今後將集中全力，襄助史達林參加蘇共黨政治同之決策。職是之故，彼等乃不得不擺脫內閣中之日常政務。熟悉蘇聯事務之英國人士僉認莫洛托夫與米高揚之卸除內閣職務，不過爲行政上的改組，故兩氏與其被認爲革職，母寗稱之爲升職。彼等於卸除內閣職務後，卽可以全副精力參加最高水準的決策，同時亦可分担已有七十高齡的史達林元帥的重担。維辛斯基於調任新職時不在莫斯科而在捷克，故絕無排擠莫洛托夫而取其職位的可能。維氏之出任外長，實際上等於外交部的降級而並非維辛斯基的升級。國外貿易部長之易人，情形亦正如是。</p>

<h3>蘇今後外交政策　將控制亞洲大陸　美國務院正擬具反措施</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓六日電〕維辛斯基出任蘇聯外長後，美國務部於今日週末照常辦公，以擬具美國方面的適當反措施。莫斯科報告傳來維辛斯基以外長身份欣然參加招待北韓代表閱宴會之消息後，使美國對於此次蘇外長之更易，加添不少注意。華盛頓方面已漸信此次外長之更易，殆係由於蘇聯在西歐外交失敗，今後將移轉陣地於亞洲之表示。</p>
<p>國務部官員指稱：莫洛托失之免職，必係出於蘇聯政府深知必須對北大西洋公約這一張王牌，立卽覓取對策之故。莫洛托夫之全力拉攏西歐的政策，至今日已證明爲勞而無功，故維辛斯基之崛起，表示今後蘇聯的外交政策將一反過去作風，而重視亞洲方面，將歐洲置於次要地位。因此，維辛斯基出任外長之初卽以盛大宴會招待北韓代表團；實具有相當的重要性。此間一官員率直預料，維辛斯基今後必將使共產主義在歐洲方面的損失，能在亞洲獲得補償。華盛頓方面，相信蘇聯今後必將加緊在亞洲及遠東的主義戰爭，以平衡被北大西洋公約所推翻的均勢。克林姆宮方面預料，至今春中國問題必可因共產黨之勝利而解決；而緬甸政府屆時亦必近於崩潰，此兩重大改變，將使亞洲的政治局勢完全改變，而使蘇聯不費吹灰之力安然取得亞洲大陸的控制權。就戰略上言，此兩大發展之成爲事實，將使英美在亞洲方而的經營爲之一筆勾消。</p>

<h3>港電存棉枯竭說　棉紡業權威剖視</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最折港電傳稱，本市各紗廠存棉，僅敷消耗至本月底左右，卽將全部用罄。記者昨曾向本市棉紡業某權成徵詢對該訊之意見。據談：此訊或係指本市若干民聲之現狀而言，營本市若干民營紗廠，前此曾因京滬局勢危急，頗多將資金陸續外劃者，致補充原棉之資金無形减少。遷者大局仍在和戰未定之天，故各廠營業方針，多未能顯明確定，大多抱需要時卽陸續添購原料，不需時卽行停頓，影響所及，遂使各廠原棉存底大告削减。照一般估計，各民營廠在滬之存棉，大致尙敷繼續開工一個半月之需。國營紡建公司所屬各廠，原棉存底較裕，除自身之存底外，再加紗布外銷後所易得之原棉，美援棉花委負會所託紡棉紗之原棉，及國棉聯購處等所託購之原棉，故估計存棉足敷繼續開工三月之需。最近該公司卽可獲得第三批美援棉花約有二萬八千包之諧（每包五百磅），故原棉供應暫時不致感到恐慌。該公司近因原棉來源充裕，所規各廠之一般開工奪，自本月份起，　為每週五日六夜制，以便充裕紗布供應而收平穩紗布市價之效。</p>

<p>茅以昇演講「科學期刊的使命」，對科學期刊同人提出四點希望：（一）每一期刊至少有一人終身從事其業。（二）每一期刊有其努力之重點。（三）出版期彼此配合，同類者不同時出版。（四）應用統一的名詞。並希望藉中國科學期刊之努力，使中國政治經濟各方面均有科學的精神。</p>
<p>來賓許君遠致詞，認為科學刊物應走向農間，而敎育不普及，亦為科學刊物銷路不暢原因之一，希望今後報紙能與刊物取得聯繫。趙視康亦強調科學應深入農村，使農村工業化。裘維裕認為普及科學敎育方法應多多舉辦流動科學講演和放映科學電影。各來賓致詞完畢後，繼以選舉並攝影，由印刷業招待午餐。下午二時年會復假迪化中路中國紡織學會舉行專題討論，由裘維裕陳聘丞主持，討論題目為「中國科學期刊的今後任務」。繼由張孟聞主持會務討論。晚七時紡織業招待晚餐，並有抽獎餘興。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕矗立在江西路漢口路尖角的市府大廈，是上海市的心臟。一切有關市政建設的公文，每天在這裏川流不息，猶如動靜脈裏的血液，循環流通。藉着心臟有規律的跳動，維繫了這國際都市的繁榮。而今天，它也患了極嚴重的貧血症，如不及時醫治，細胞卽將死亡。心臟停止工作以後，上海市會有怎樣的惡果，是不難想像得到的。　生活在這座巍峨大廈裏的，市長吳國楨之下，總計一千餘人。每天從早到晚，他們坐定在這座大廈裏，不管生活指數已經跳到六百四十三倍；新經濟方案公布後，物價又告飛漲，公用事業正在跟着美金奔跑，而到今天為止，他們的酬給，還是依政府所公布的公務員生活指數七十五倍計薪的。記者曾特地加以統計，吳市長每月薪給是金圓券一萬七千四百元，市長以下小公務員的待遇，以不上萬的佔大多數，而拿六十元底薪的工友呢？今天所得的是金圖四千五百元正。</p>
<p>吳市長薪金　僅夠買雙襪</p>
<p>記得記者有一次曾經問過吳市長：「你拿了這幾個錢怎麼化呢？」市長笑着答：「統統交給太太。」事實上市長的薪金僅够讓夫人買雙絲襪，然而，誰都不會替市長生活發愁的。但是市長之下，那些拿幾千元一月的小公務員是怎樣生活的呢？換句話，就是冷宮裏面坐着冷板櫈的一羣究竟是如何活着的？這豈不是成了「奇蹟」。我相信好奇的人們，一定都願意得知「奇蹟」是如何產生的……</p>
<p>一年以前，市政府新聞處有一個科長呌魏孝剛的，也許當時就很少人知道他，現在更難得有人記得了，因為他早已成為「奇蹟」下的犧牲者。魏科長高高的個兒，架着一副玳瑁邊的深度近視眼鏡整天坐在寫字桌旁搖着筆桿兒，擅長公文，還寫得一手好字。他實際年齡四十來歲，但蒼老的樣子讓人覺得他至少是五十以上的人，而依然是光棍兒一個。魏科畏決不是一個興趣索然令人見而生厭的老頑固，他是個正常的人，應該有合理的需求，只是不合理的現實剝奪了他。接近他的人就常常可以聽到他的一番戀愛大道理，到處宣傳說是要組織追求同盟，他自任盟主，並廣交盟友。</p>
<p>白天辦公桌　入晚便是床</p>
<p>記得那時候跑市府消息的新聞記者，都愛他的那份風趣，常喜鞦跟他聊天。有時候我們在新聞處談天談晚了，就發起上館子「蜻蜓咬尾巴」，也就是所謂自己吃自己的，每屆這當兒，他必定先溜，因為他付不出這一份錢，他是偷偷地溜到二馬路牛肉攤上去吃他的陽春大麵的，這就是他經常的晚餐。吃完了以後，就重回市府，摸着漆黑的樓梯，爬在他白天辦公的寫字檯上睡覺。這就是他的家。新聞室壁櫥裏，有一條二年來從沒洗過的破棉絮，就是每天陪他睡覺給他溫暖的恩物。第二天淸早，他起身了，用冷水擦把臉，照例坐在寫字檯旁做那些刻板的工作，像一架機器似的，從不脫班。有一天，魏科長突然不見了，聽說是生了病，沒多天，就傳來了死訊。這噩耗當然未曾轟動市府，因為他僅是一個平凡的小科長。雖然你要是到人事處去查一查，你就會知道科長也不是容易當的。他要大學畢業，而且還須在公務機關當過高級辦事員等等資歷。　現在魏科長是死了，他是讓地獄似的生活所吞噬的。要是他還活着，他不正是「奇蹟」之一例？</p>
<p>上月拿七百　本月還未領</p>
<p>魏孝剛是個科長，在今天，一個科長還可以拿到一萬元左右，那麼比科長更不如的下級職工又該怎麼活下去呢？記者為了發掘這個「奇蹟」的根源，又曾訪問了市府的一個工友。他今年三十四歲，原籍河北，抗戰時曾報名入伍，在閘北上過前綫兩次。勝利以後，就經人介紹入市府當工友。他白天打掃公事房，夜間就睡在地板上。每天一粥二飯，都是在市府飯堂裏吃的，因為這是員工福利委員會所辦，價格比較便宜得多。但是每月領來的錢，付了飯錢後，所剩無幾，有時候連理髮洗澡的都付不出，總是向同伴東借西湊，月月虧空。他說他上個月拿到的工錢是七百多元，這個月到現在還沒有領到他又嘆口氣說：「只好過一天算一天，但求不餓死」。　幸而魏科長和這位工友都沒有成家，（雖然他們都已經到了結婚年齡），所以還只須混飽一個兒的肚子。但是那些已經有了家而且兒女成羣的公務員呢？他們又會有何等樣的「奇蹟」呢？</p>
<p>月薪四五千　吃麵都不夠</p>
<p>打開兩天以前的報紙，本埠版上有這麼一條觸目驚心的記載：「昨日本市有一公務員，因生活不能維特，忍痛將兒女四人送往泰興路婦女敎養所請求救濟，情况至為悲慘。綠有黃某曾受高等敎育，服務本市公務機關有年，現住市府職員宿舍，每月薪津四五千元及配給米三斗，區區此數，一家幾口連買白水煮麵吃都不够，小孩上學以米論學費，更不能負担，這位公務員乃毅然決然帶了他的女兒黃笑睛（現年七歲二年級），黃冬嬋（現年十一歲五年級），黃玲珠（現年十二歲），黃素珍（現年十四歲六年級），送到敎養所去。孩子們哭哭啼啼，並且對人說：「媽媽帶了二個小弟弟被疏散到杭州鄉下去，讓爸爸好在上海生活」。這位爸爸忍着眼淚與女兒分別。出門的時候，敎養所所長對他說：「這兒沒有高級班，大孩子讀書成問題」。那位公務員苦笑了一聲，回答說：「現在不能談讀書不讀書，祇要把肚子混飽」。</p>
<p>太慘了，不必再企求有奇蹟的出現了，這種生活，已經是人類史上的「奇蹟」了！誰無天性？天下做父母的誰又忍心與親生骨肉生別？在今天，公務員生活確已陷於絕境，是到了運束緊腰帶都活不下去的關頭，如再不及時謀合理改善，預料慘絕人寰的種種「奇蹟」更會層出不窮，其惡果恐將不堪設想。</p>
<p>如今，巍峨的市府大廈已成為陰暗的人間地獄，成羣的公務員在死亡綫上掙扎，願執政大員的垂憐！</p>

<h3>全英羽大戰告終　馬華雙采舉世無匹　費禮門再勝黃德福　依然保持單打皇座</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播：全英羽毛球大賽之五項錦標得主，經四日來一百七十八名選手之劇烈競爭，業巳產生。計馬華得男子雙打，美國獲得男子單打及混合變打兩項；丹麥得女子單打，英國得女子雙打。</p>
<p>今日哈靈蓋球塲內觀衆達七千人。第一項女子單打決賽，丹麥　谷笙小姐經三局苦戰，以八比十一，十一比八，十一比四反敗為勝，擊敗其雙打搭檔史紋小姐，獲得冠軍。</p>
<p>費禮門雖以十五比一，十五比六擊敗黃德福，稱霸男子單打，但戰情之劇烈，則為此十八歲起卽未逢敵手之年青醫生全英比賽中未之前遇。</p>
<p>黃德福賽初仍然失常，被費禮門輕易連得九分，此後黃氏始較見順手，迫使費氏一球得失，必經畏期鬥爭。後黃德福以一下極美妙準確之猛壓，扳回一分時，費禮門拍長莫及，竟至失聲大呌</p>
<p>第二局黃德福福有優異演出，曾一度以五比四迫使費禮門屆居下風，惜此後卽漸露疲態，費禮門乘機反攻，連下七城。黃德福雖力圖掙扎，但曇花一現，扳回一分後，卽以六比十五敗續。費禮門於焉踏上世界羽壇覇座。按此次全英大賽，包羅代表馬華，美國，丹麥，印度等地參加湯瑪斯盃國際賽之全部選手，故大賽冠軍，亦卽全世界冠軍。</p>
<p>女子雙打決賽，英國之尤葩夫人與雅倫小姐以十五比八，十五比十力克上屆錦標保持者丹麥之安姆夫人及桑達兒小姐。</p>
<p>男子雙打錦標為黃德一福與張成琨所獲。對手為湯瑪斯盃中手下敗將費禮門與羅傑士。初上塲時，美國組曾以四對〇佔先，但馬華之黃張立卽奮起，追成各四，此後更避重就輕，顱定羅傑士防衛上之弱點進攻，果然戰略奏効，不旋踵卽以十五比五勝第一局</p>
<p>第二局馬華組一仍奮貫，不使費禮門有施展身手之機會，遂又以十五對四獲得勝利。</p>
<p>按男雙半決賽時，楊德才曾官良組係以十五比五，五比十五，十五比四被費禮門羅傑士淘汰。馬華另組林其芳·王保林則係於同室操戈中被黃張以二比一擊敗</p>
<p>最後一項混合雙打為美國史蒂芬夫婦所獲。史蒂芬伉儷賴過人之默契以十五比五，五比十五，十五比十二壓倒羅傑士與稚倫小姐之美英聯軍。</p>
<h3>一分之差　華聯敗於番將</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽甲一組昨晚霸主華聯竟以一分慘敗於美海軍培斐　，比數為四四比四三，上半時廿三比廿一華聯前導二分。勝敗的主要原因，在乎「氣」「力』兩字，華聯初戰時似乎有些看輕對方的樣子，迨培斐爾得勢，為時已晚，這足予華聯一次敎訓，對方黑人勃郎表演殊為動人。</p>

<h3>鐵路全軍用命　三比一克志超　本週末與中航奪冠軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市長杯足球賽複賽又一塲，鐵路人材平均，前後呼應靈活，力戰九十分鐘，卒以三比一淘汰志超，獲得決賽權，上半時鐵路先勝一球。鐵路在高保正領導之下，前鋒後衛確實較勝一籌，志超雖有吳祺祥坐鎭中堅，奈孤棠難鳴，力不從心，全軍後勁缺乏，無力平反。昨日天氣睛和，春意盎然，球迷三千餘人，興緻彌佳。裁判員張樂，巡邊員吳守衡陸順德。鐵路中航將於本週末決奪市長杯冠軍。</p>
<p>鐵路先攻，陸慶祥直迫門前，吳祺祥當頭一砲，擊退敵兵。志超反擊，錢元慶朱家錚自左進攻，無功而返。朱成九高球遠送，於洽與向鐵路大門直撲，廖雄衝出，高保正軌住，許大爲一拉，球飛出界·鐵路進攻，曹禮明送球，吳炳浩迎頭一頂，盛彼得抱個滿懷。鐵路還擊，陸炳生傳前，蕭子文頭頂，亦未成功。此來我往，相持卅六分鐘，林典義沿邊直襲，一脚勿中，張傑脚起球落，上半時鐵路一比零佔先。</p>
<p>下半時鐵路攻勢益盛，上半時之拉鋸局面，逐漸改觀，半小時過去，蕭子文得後來球，吳祺祥竟被騙過，又建一功，鐵路以二比零佔得優勢。吳祺祥發奮圖強，御駕親征，開上前綫，與徐國平互易位置。但麾下小將，已精疲力盡，　於用命，　子文乘機又至，一脚中柱彈出，陸慶祥趕上蹴入，比數成直落三。大勞已去，志超背城借一，進攻不巳。在鐵路門外，曹禮明手觸皮球，判罰任憲球。志超陸義德送去，急而且遠，尙世琪挑過岳仁孝，吳祺祥近門一鍊，球進白綫，志超扳回一球，朱吃鴨蛋，三比一結局。</p>

<h3>運動世界　鐵志戰後評</h3>
<p>看鐵路與志超對壘，好比看吳棋祥與高保正鬥法，但保正便宜在搭配較為齊整，而祺祥則獨木難支汰廈，前前後後，都要靠他一人支撑，牡丹難好，尙須綠葉扶持，有人說志超要是有兩個吳祺祥，一個在前，一個在後就好了</p>
<p>志起雖係新軍，在吳祺祥薰陶下，較季初已進步多多，此祺祥功之不可沒。</p>
<p>全盛時期之靑白，現已健將星散，保正領導鐵路，祺祥支撑志超，高秀淸為中航台柱，吳凱敏亦為龍頭主將，祗剩孟義良在靑白，提掖後進。到下季假使嚴士鑫來組織一個銀行同人隊，阿福亦改投他隊，則每一隊有靑白舊友作主腦，倒也有趣。</p>
<p>志超右翼尙世洪上半時演出不弱，有速度有腦子，但病在位置太落後，不肯深入，下半時氣力用盡，活動因之大打折扣。</p>
<p>江雷亦是可見，但在敵鋒得球時，後退太速，因之防區被迫縮小，敵鋒如有擅遠射者，因而建功豈非罪有應得。</p>
<p>鐵路中間本鋒聯絡默契，合作有素，相當具有咸力，張傑有速度，蕭陸二人協助推進，，形成中間一小三角形。左翼吳炳浩傳中有路，但速度够不上，右翼林典羲有速度，但是祇能直綫上前，老遠就傳中，所以有人說鐵路之進攻為維形進攻，或中央突破</p>
<p>市長盃靑白慘遭意外毒手，鐵路飛來鴻福，染指此盃，希望甚濃，但據說中航有向香島借將訊，如此則強敵當前，尙難高枕無憂也。</p>

<h3>精神療法醫治賭癖</h3>
<p>— 竹溪</p>
<p>美國有一位大心靈學家呌做哈來佐拉的，具有驚人的心靈觀測能力。他對於數字的記憶力特別靈敏，你可以在一張大格子板上，每行十五格，每格中塡寫一個數字，哈萊只須略一過目，便能把那些數字一一依次背誦出來，絲毫不爽。他還能用心算，把每一橫行或直行的數字加起來。有幾個好事的數學家有一天特地帶來一架計算機，來和他比資計算的速度，結果是：計算機比不上他。</p>
<p>哈萊在遊藝會中表演幻術，每星期可以收入二千美元，可是他還不滿足，他想：為什麼不可以把他的腦力用到獲利更大的塲合呢？於是他便開始賭博。</p>
<p>賭博還不是機會法則底科學的運用嗎？這些機會法則誰能比一位大數學家推算得更精確些呢？當一粒骰子擲出四點的時候，再度擲出的機會究竟如何？哈萊是知道的，他可以推算到幾位小數點。可是美中不足，贏家總是不屬於哈萊。他的解釋是：「假如我能够再下一次注，一定可以獲勝，可惜我手頭的錢巳轍光了。」</p>
<p>哈萊靠他的數學天才賺來的錢，都送到了賭檯上去。他計算一下，前前後後巳一共輸去了十六萬七千四百三十八元五角美金</p>
<p>心理學家們研究他的記憶方法和數學本領，起初很不了解，像這樣一個智力優異的人，為什麼那樣容易受騙。但是後來明白，賭博對於哈萊，已經變成一種像嗜好一樣的痼疾了。</p>
<p>紐約一位精神病學家布格勒博士，對此曾經下過一番研究，得到一個結論：嗜賭成癖的賭徒，是不能控制他行為的神經病患者，到後來，他以痛苦為享受，以損失為痛快。</p>
<p>某權威學者曾經說過，嗜賭者是一個不知悔改不可救藥的過失者。但是精神病學者大都不以為然。他們認為嗜賭者可以用精神病療法來醫治好，不過醫治一個酗酒者或麻醉劑嗜好者，往往比較勸化一個嗜賭者改過目新為容易。照布格勒的解說，嗜睹者有下列六種特徵：</p>
<p>一，嗜賭者有冒險投機的習慣性；</p>
<p>二，賭博的趣味高於其他一切趣味，他的念頭已全部貫注在賭博上；</p>
<p>三，嗜賭者常抱樂觀，不因失敗而氣餒；</p>
<p>四，嗜賭者贏錢時不肯歇手，輸錢時也不肯罷休。</p>
<p>五，開頭雖然小心翼翼，到後來不惜孤注一擲，不管是應付的房租，下月份的伙食費，別人交託的款項，或是經手的公款，都可以下注了。</p>
<p>六，在下注以後和勝負摘曉以前這一段時間，賭博者有一種快樂而又痛苦的緊張興奮情緒。賭博者可以說是為了想贏錢而入局，或者為了「詡本」而入局，可是實際上往往並非如此，而是一種追求精神刺激的慾望。</p>
<p>醫治賭博者的唯一方法，祇有精神病療法。如果有機會能够尋出病根所在，用精神病治療法去醫治賭博病，往往可以發生效騐。當病家發覺賭博是一種想損害他人或損害自己的嗜好時，他就開始覺悟，而終必有毅然戒絕賭　的一天了。</p>
<h3>原來如此</h3>
<p>夜舞會上，一位漂亮女郎頸上團着一根金練，下面掛一只小巧精緻的金質飛機。一位少年盯住它望着。</p>
<p>「你很欣賞這架小飛機嗎？」女郎問。「不，小姐，」少年回答。「我是欣賞這片停機塲呢。」（利）</p>
<h3>關於女人的傳說</h3>
<p>— 藍寗</p>
<p>梵文經典上有段古老的神話，說當初開天關地的時候，世界是大神創造的。他用各種原素創造了太陽，”亮和星星，山谷和森林，最後創造了男人。</p>
<p>所有堅固的物質都已在造男人時用完了，因此，當他要觀造女人的時候，巳一無所有。大神便綴拾了月亮的圓潤，水蛇的顫動，葛蘿的纏繞，玫瑰藤的窈窕，鮮花的嬌艷，綠葉的輕盈，小鹿的驚捷，陽光的晶　，迷霧的細淚，微風的　忽，野兔的畏怯，孔省的虛榮，天鵝絨的柔軟，金剛鑚的堅硬，蜂蜜的甜瀾，猛虎的殘忍，火的溫暖，雪的寒冷，　鳥的饒舌，斑鳩的婉轉，……把所有道些混和起來，造成了女人。他將女人給男人作為伴侶。</p>
<p>於是男人的生活中充滿了快樂，因為他現在有了個與他共同領受世間樂趣的人了。他們一起在松林草氈上漫步，傾聽羣鳥的歌唱，手挽着手看旭日上升。黃昏時分，一同遙對着日落後天邊變幻的雲彩驚嘆。</p>
<p>可是，隔了些時，那男人去見大神了，說：</p>
<p>「把她帶回去吧，把你賜給我的那個女人帶走吧，因為她毒害了我的生存。她終日不斷的嘮叨，侵蝕了我的時間，使我不能完成我所企冀完成的更光榮神聖的事業。她常常無可理喻地哭泣，而且也常常害病。」</p>
<p>於是大神把她帶了回去。但是八天以後，那男人又在大神面前出現了。</p>
<p>「神啊，」他說，「從那女人走後，我的生活是多麼孤寂啊。把她給還我吧！因為我記起了她在我面前舞蹈時輕盈的倩影，記起了她甜甜的笑聲，在我心中充滿了快樂。我記起了她怎樣依偎着我，而當日落以後，天工作完畢，黑暗環繞着我的時候，她的存在又是何等的甜蜜與安慰。」</p>
<p>於是大神把女人送還給她。然而，只過了一月，那男人又來懇求他了。</p>
<p>「神啊，」他說道，「我不知道這是怎樣的。我不瞭解，但我確實知道那女人給我的騷擾興煩惱多於快樂。我請求你，大神，再把她帶回去吧。」</p>
<p>大神答道：「回去，盡你的力量與她好好相處吧。」</p>
<p>「但我實在不能再與她一起生活了。」</p>
<p>「然而，沒有了她，你也是同樣不能生活的。」上帝如此下了結論。</p>
<p>這個結論據說到現在還沒有改變。</p>
<h3>談「森林之曲」</h3>
<p>— 王冊</p>
<p>在介紹「森林之曲」以前，先約略一提題材相似的「英獅」發行的「紅菱艷」。「紅菱艷」寫一個表演舞劇的舞孃，墮入戀愛後，無法兼顧事業，終致跳樓自殺。全劇充滿悒怨，迷離，它逗人眼淚，也使人慨嘆藝人的下塲。加之全片色彩，燈光，塲景的變幻，也極盡瑰麗。在英美影片中，它是惹人喜愛的。</p>
<p>但是，故事與「紅菱艷」相仿的蘇聯新片「森林之曲」，它在主題上，顯然與「紅菱艷」有着極大的分野。「紅菱艷」所代表的，是個人主義的，頹廢的。一切音樂，藝術，舞蹈家，對於藝術與愛戀的衡量，個人的「法碼」要比別種因素強得多。「紅菱艷」的女主角，為人捨不得戀人，拋不開舞蹈，終致自殺。她的下塲固然可悲，但祇限於個人主義的哀傷。</p>
<p>而「森林之曲」的音樂家，它沒有把愛戀置於第一位，他雖然因戰爭手部受傷，致無法彈奏鋼琴，但他毅然拿起了手風琴，遠遠地躲到西伯利亞的森林里，為廣大的人民歌唱，為眞正愛妤音樂的人們，寫下更多更有意義的樂曲。</p>
<p>正如劇中女歌唱家娜達沙譴責另一位鍋琴手一樣：</p>
<p>「你們只曉得自己，是自私自利，你雖然是一個鋼琴的名家，但與人民有什麼關係？」（大意）</p>
<p>中國不乏許多躱在象牙之塔里自我陶醉的學院派音樂家，你們且聽！</p>
<p>「森林之曲」里的民歌風的合唱，是全片精華所在，值得讚美。</p>
<p>華語對白，總覺得不合適。以一個紅髮藍眼睛的人，卽使國語說得再好，在許多嚴肅的塲面里，觀衆會嘩然大笑。這種配音方法，我個人認為是不可取的。</p>
<h3>鄙人鄭重建議</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>

<h3>「月亮與六便士」</h3>

<p>上海的空氣委實太沉悶了，讓我們谈談別的吧。</p>
<p>一金門」已自上週六起放映由英作家主罕姆小說改編攝製的「　聖情痴」。毛罕姆，在中國是個並不陌生的名字。他的作品經好萊塢攝成影片的，像「香箋淚」，「雨來」，「孽債」，及尙未運滬的「剃刀邊　」等都是「画聖情痴」係根據「月亮與六便士」所改编，是毛罕姆的成名作（一九一九）。小說中主角斯屈立克偷，原是倫敦一個股票掮客，因為醉心藝術，棄家到巴黎拉丁區　　，其間經歷了　番顛沛曲折的羅曼史，終於在南海一個珊瑚島上，找到了他所迫求的自然美。　故事與法國近代大畫家谷近Aaugin之一生頗有相似處，因此頗有人說毛罕姆寫「月亮與六便士」時，腦中存着个谷近的影子的。可是毛罕姆旣不承認，當然誰也無法證實。毛罕姆最新的著作是去年出版的一本宗敎小說“Catalina”曾在哈伯雜　上通載。</p>

<h3>The Beijing-Shanghai Control Issue to Become a Key Topic in Peace Talks; Yu Hanmou and Other Leaders from Southern China Scheduled to Fly to Beijing Today; Zhang Zhizhong Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Peace Negotiation Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Executive Yuan Vice President Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and remained in Shanghai yesterday. He spent the entire day attending to important official matters and did not return to his residence until late at night. General Zhang Zhizhong, who is on a special mission to Xikou for negotiations, also stopped in Shanghai yesterday on his way back to Beijing. Wu and Zhang held important consultations here yesterday with key government officials to discuss the peace negotiation plan and strive to bridge the opinions of relevant parties. In the past, due to the lack of suitable individuals to mediate between various related parties, there were inevitable gaps in understanding the current situation. Furthermore, busybodies engaged in speculation, leading to numerous rumors that significantly impacted the overall situation. The current efforts of Wu and Zhang are aimed at serving as a bridge, ensuring that the peace plan is formulated with broad input and without omissions, and that all parties can agree on the plan once it is finalized. It is rumored that Vice President Wu may travel to eastern Zhejiang in the next few days to ensure the thorough implementation of his mission. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] It is reported that the Chinese Communists may not insist on their original demands regarding the issue of war criminals, but those on the blacklist will not be allowed to participate in the future coalition government. The organization of the coalition government will still be based on the decisions made at the former Political Consultative Conference. Regarding the issue of jurisdiction over the Beijing-Shanghai area, it is likely to become one of the key topics of discussion during negotiations. The government hopes that the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai will remain under government control, while the Chinese Communists believe that Beijing and Shanghai are political, industrial, commercial, and cultural centers, and therefore should be controlled by the Chinese Communists to achieve the goal of controlling the entire country politically and financially. However, the lack of urban technical talent among the Chinese Communists will undoubtedly be a difficult challenge. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Zhang Zhizhong and Wu Zhongxin, who went to eastern Zhejiang a few days ago, have not yet returned to Beijing as of the 6th. They are currently engaged in discussions in Shanghai and are expected to return to Beijing soon to report to Acting President Li and others. The Ten-Member Committee will reconvene within days to conduct a thorough discussion on the content of the peace negotiation plan. Zhang Qun visited Cheng Qian at the Capital Hotel at approximately 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th and departed after an hour of conversation. Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, and Chen Jitang may fly to Beijing from Guangdong today at the invitation of Acting President Li.

<h3>Nanjing Salvation Daily Penalized with Three-Day Suspension; Gong Debai Released After Severe Warning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Nanjing Salvation Daily almost suffered a major disaster due to two editorials. The newspaper was sealed by security agencies at midnight on the 5th, and the president, Gong Debai, was also summoned for questioning. However, by the evening of the 6th, it was decided to lift the seal, and the penalty was only a three-day suspension. Gong himself was released after receiving a "severe warning." The Salvation Daily is managed by Gong Debai, whose comments are known for their "artillery fire." For two consecutive days, the 4th and 5th, the newspaper published editorials titled "The People Demand Clarity in the Political Situation" and "China Cannot Be Saved Unless Chiang Kai-shek Leaves the Country," respectively. The content was intense, and the authorities were quite dissatisfied. At 11:00 PM on the evening of the 5th, the Capital Garrison Headquarters, in conjunction with the police and security authorities, sent personnel to seal the newspaper. They first went to Gong's residence to explain the authorities' reasons for summoning him. Gong immediately complied and went with them. Then, they went to the Salvation Daily to seal it. The execution was very polite, and the newspaper's colleagues were not offended in the slightest. Only the machine room, typesetting room, and other departments were sealed. The execution was completed at 3:00 AM on the morning of the 6th. At the time of the sealing, the newspaper's editorial department was working as usual, and then stopped. The newspaper was not published on the 6th. According to the editorial in the Salvation Daily on the 4th, "The People Demand Clarity in the Political Situation," the responsibility for creating today's serious situation rests with President Chiang, and that even after his retirement, he is still "manipulating politics and military affairs behind the scenes." The editorial on the 5th, "China Cannot Be Saved Unless Chiang Kai-shek Leaves the Country," stated that peace talks with the Communist Party were impossible unless President Chiang leaves the country. If the war continues, only President Chiang's departure can secure American aid. The two articles also touched on the failures of the Northeast and Xuzhou campaigns, the failure of the price control policy, and the fact that Acting President Li only holds a nominal title. The Garrison Headquarters considered that the newspaper's comments had no basis and summoned Gong for questioning. After asking higher authorities for instructions on the evening of the 6th, it was decided that the newspaper should be suspended for three days for failing to exercise proper editorial control, and President Gong Debai received a severe warning. Gong was detained in the Garrison Headquarters for less than 20 hours and returned to his residence that night.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Yaoming, Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Commander of the Capital Garrison Headquarters Zhang Yaoming issued the following statement regarding the punishment of the Salvation Daily and the questioning of its publisher, Gong Debai, on the evening of the 5th: (1) In the Salvation Daily's editorials on the 4th of this month, "The People Demand Clarity in the Political Situation," and the 5th, "China Cannot Be Saved Unless Chiang Kai-shek Leaves the Country," the paper slandered President Chiang, who led the completion of the Northern Expedition and the victory in the War of Resistance, and who took the lead in retiring to seek peace; insulted Acting President Li, who took office in a time of crisis and made the greatest efforts for peace; falsely accused high-ranking generals who died in battle and those currently serving; and fabricated rumors to provoke the relationship between the retired President Chiang and Acting President Li, conspired to undermine unity, instigated political unrest, added to the government's difficulties, and hindered the progress of peace. It also used alarmist language in an attempt to create chaos in people's minds and disintegration from top to bottom, leading to a situation of being caught between war and peace. This vicious conspiracy is truly harmful to the entire nation. After the newspaper's two editorials were published, the military and civilians of the capital were filled with anger. This headquarters has repeatedly received reports that many people wanted to take direct action against the newspaper. This headquarters is responsible for the security of the capital and cannot sit idly by while the newspaper wantonly incites provocation and causes unrest in the capital. Therefore, in accordance with Article 11 of the Strict Laws, this headquarters temporarily closed the newspaper. (2) The newspaper's editorial on the 4th stated that President Chiang "violated the opinions of all the generals in the Northeast, causing the entire elite army to be wiped out," "he is still issuing orders," and he wants to deal with the Gui clique. "There is also an enemy in the city of Nanjing," "There is another enemy in Hankou, and I don't know how many enemies there are in each province." It also said that Acting President Li is "this kind of puppet" and that in the editorial on the 5th, "But Chiang is hiding behind the scenes and controlling everything," "The good time of these two months has completely disappeared due to Chiang's infighting." What is the basis for all of this? What evidence is there? It is necessary to question the publisher of the newspaper, Gong Debai, in order to clarify the truth, and then ask higher authorities for instructions.</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Speaks in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Says This Trip is Unrelated to Politics; Will Go to Hong Kong for Recuperation Soon</p>

He arrived in Guangzhou a few days ago. When reporters interviewed him and asked about the purpose of this trip, he said: "Mainly for the Guangzhou distribution of the Central China Daily. I am the chairman of the newspaper's board of directors, so I came here to preside over everything. Military and political leaders here, such as Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, and Zhang Fakui, are all old friends of mine for many years. Since I have come to Guangzhou, I will naturally visit them separately. This is purely personal in nature and has nothing to do with politics at all." He will be staying in Hong Kong temporarily in the near future and will return to Hubei once his condition improves.</p>
<h3>Nationalist Army Recaptures Beichao Dam Near Taiyuan; Municipal Council Cables Executive Yuan to Allocate Civilian Food</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] Small-scale skirmishes have been frequent around Taiyuan in recent days. The Communist army on the southwest line of the city has been very active recently, constantly harassing the Nationalist army's positions. In order to eliminate the threat, the Nationalist army launched a mop-up operation on the 5th against Beichao Dam, about 20 miles away from the city on the west bank of the Fen River. After a battle, Beichao Dam was captured. In the evening, small skirmishes occurred on the line from the southeast to the northeast of the city. In the southeast, the Nationalist army launched a search and suppression operation against the Communist army in the northwest area of the mountains north of Qianjiazhai. After being hit hard, the Communist army fled in a panic. In the northeast of the city, Guo Zhao destroyed three Communist army concealed fortifications and two bunkers east of Xialing, seizing a large amount of supplies.

<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] In order to solve the grain shortage problem, the Taiyuan Municipal Council recently pleaded with the central government on behalf of more than 300,000 citizens to allocate civilian food. The original telegram stated: "To Premier Sun Ke of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, greetings. Taiyuan has been besieged for a long time, and there is a shortage of food. It is now spring, and the old crops have been exhausted before the new crops are ready. Nine out of ten households in the city are empty-handed and have nothing to cook. It is difficult to find even grass roots and tree bark to satisfy their hunger. We sincerely request that the Executive Yuan allocate food, strengthen air transport, enrich civilian food, and save those who are in danger, in order to enhance the strength to defend Taiyuan. The telegram is urgent and we cannot wait any longer."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Considers Replacing Commercial Representative to Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The government's commercial representative to Tokyo is about to be replaced. The incumbent Tang Jusheng will be transferred to another position. The successor is currently being considered by the responsible Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's proposal is related to the report made by the representative to Japan, Shang Wang Zhuoran and seven others, who returned to the country from Tokyo to report to the authorities on trade with Japan. Since January of last year, the government has sent four batches of commercial representatives to Japan, totaling ten people. Recently, eight of them returned to the country and submitted three opinions to the authorities: (1) reduce control over trade with Japan, (2) abolish quotas for exports to Japan, (3) carefully select commercial representatives to Japan. The main figures had come to Beijing a few days ago to pay respects to the relevant authorities, and Da Niu had returned to Shanghai one after another, but Wang Zhuoran was still staying in Beijing. According to the statement, if the government attaches importance to the development of trade with Japan, this matter has great prospects. Not only can agricultural products be exported, but also cotton textiles can be exported to Japan for the use of 30,000 overseas Chinese.</p>

It is said that the more than forty members of the Legislative Yuan who are still here are preparing to attend the Nanjing meeting that will begin this week. The members of the Legislative Yuan held a final meeting here today to persuade the stubborn elements who are still insisting on staying in Guangzhou. Because the members of the Legislative Yuan in Beijing were unable to obtain a quorum and the members of the Legislative Yuan in Guangzhou failed to win enough support to continue their work, this change occurred.

He hopes that the peace talks can proceed smoothly so that peace can be achieved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 6th] Members of the Control Yuan began to register on the 6th and will hold a plenary meeting on the 12th to severely criticize Premier Sun Ke of the Executive Yuan for engaging in illegal trading.

<h3>Hong Kong Merchants and Trade with North China</h3>
<p>— Our Hong Kong Correspondent, Ziji</p>
<p>Hong Kong merchants have a very beautiful slogan, which is "Business is Business." Under the premise of this slogan, their most urgent move at the moment is to restore commerce between Hong Kong and North China. After two to three months of preparation and planning, this move has now transformed from an ideal into a reality.</p>
<p>After the Hong Kong government spokesman officially announced on March 1 that the Hong Kong government would not prevent ships from sailing to ports under the control of the Chinese Communists, the Taikoo liner "Hanyang," originally scheduled to sail to Incheon, South Korea, on the 3rd, began loading goods destined for Tianjin. It was rescheduled to depart on the 5th, planning to sail to Tanggu first, and then proceed to South Korea. This is the first vessel to formally trial sail between Hong Kong and Tianjin. After this news spread, the ship immediately received about 2,000 tons of cargo, with a freight rate of HK$150 per ton. The shipping company stated that if the goods could not be unloaded at Tanggu, they would be unloaded at Incheon instead, to which the merchants had no objection.</p>
<p>According to investigations by this reporter: The Hanyang is carrying mostly newsprint, rubber, Western medicine, hardware, and pigments, as well as some transportation equipment. It is said that the newsprint includes the eighty-pound Taolin paper that the Chinese Communists recently dispatched people to Hong Kong to buy up, which is being rushed to Beiping for printing "North China People's" banknotes. The Panama-flagged merchant ship Greenana, which recently sailed to North Korea, also carried a large quantity of this paper.</p>
<p>In the past two days, an advertisement has appeared in Hong Kong newspapers saying: "A new vessel from a neutral country is scheduled to sail to Tianjin on March 10, carrying passengers and cargo." Those "business is business" figures are actually holding up the banner of a "neutral country." Their "logic" is truly unbelievable!</p>
<p>Trade between Hong Kong and the areas under the control of the Chinese Communists did not begin today, and Hong Kong's trade with North Korea has already begun. There are frequent Soviet, Portuguese, and Panamanian vessels traveling between Hong Kong and Zhennampo in North Korea. According to the captain of the Portuguese vessel "Hua Zhong," his ship has gained considerably from going to North Korea, recently carrying 300 tons of Western medicine, paper, and industrial equipment, in exchange for over 1,000 tons of bristles and soybeans (which are famous products of the Northeast). Last winter, a Soviet vessel loaded with more than 3,000 tons of Northeast soybeans arrived in Hong Kong, exchanging them for auto parts, rubber tires, etc. Just as it was entering the port, it was sunk to the bottom of the sea by a larger British freighter. According to a merchant who told this reporter: Three months ago, someone rented a freighter of only 600 or 700 tons, loaded a batch of goods, and ventured to sail to Andong in Northeast China, near North Korea, exchanging them for a large quantity of soybeans, pig bristles, and horsehair, making a profit of four times. One merchant said: Although there are still some political and diplomatic entanglements to be resolved regarding the restoration of trade between Hong Kong and North China, the Chinese Communists need the supplies that Hong Kong provides even more than Hong Kong needs the raw materials of the Northeast and North China. The future of this business, in any case, is always promising.</p>
<p>In addition to the North China market, Hong Kong merchants have recently set their sights on the "new continents" of Hong Kong's ports, Hong Kong-Taiwan, and Hong Kong-Wuzhou. Let me briefly say a few words about each of them: Since 1947, "Japanese goods" have made a comeback, flooding the Hong Kong market. However, that was handled by the Hong Kong government and the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo. Recently, General MacArthur, in order to reward Japanese goods for finding overseas markets, welcomed merchants from various countries to come directly to Japan for procurement. Hong Kong merchants believe that the time is ripe and are making plans to travel east. China Airlines, seeing their needs, promptly organized a tour group to Japan, taking more than 20 people in the first batch, and the second batch is about to depart.</p>
<p>Just as Hong Kong merchants were on their way to Japan, a mining exploration team from Taiwan arrived in Hong Kong to discuss ways to promote trade between Taiwan and Hong Kong. They plan to exchange Taiwanese coal for British mining equipment and other industrial raw materials, which Hong Kong merchants are also very happy about.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan recently announced in Guangzhou the opening of Wuzhou, allowing foreign merchant ships to sail up the West River and restore foreign trade in Guangxi. The inland river navigation rights that were recovered after the war have now been lightly given back. Hong Kong merchants, taking advantage of foreign ships, are about to open up a market. In the past, Wuzhou products had to be exported through Guangzhou, but now this detour can be avoided. This is seen as a "benefit" by Hong Kong merchants, but as a "harm" by Guangdong merchants. With conflicting interests, Guangdong merchants have sent a telegram opposing the government's opening of the Pearl River, accusing it of repeating the "Qing Dynasty's mistakes"!</p>
<p>Taking advantage of Shanghai merchants being mired in the civil war, Hong Kong merchants not only have the ambition to encompass trade in the Far East, but also want to compete for the European market. Last year, several units participated in British industry and trade fairs, with quite a few promising "buds." This year, they have great ambitions and are going to London again to "knock on the door." This, in terms of business is indeed a good thing.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Will Soviet Diplomacy Undergo a Transformation?</h3>
<p>Moscow Radio announced on the 4th: Foreign Minister Molotov has been dismissed from his post, and his vacancy will be filled by Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky; Minister of Foreign Trade Mikoyan has also been dismissed at the same time, and his vacancy will be filled by Menshikov. At the same time, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gromyko has been promoted to Deputy Foreign Minister to fill Vyshinsky's vacancy. The news of this major personnel change in the Soviet cabinet is tantamount to throwing a bomb at countries around the world, shaking the entire globe, and causing a series of serious questions to arise in everyone's mind: "What will the Kremlin do now?" "Will Soviet foreign policy change?" London and Washington are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and observers generally dare not jump to conclusions. But from our point of view, Molotov has been in office as Foreign Minister for more than ten years since succeeding Litvinov in 1939. Now that he has been dismissed, there must be a profound significance to it. Will the Soviet Union's future foreign policy undergo some changes?</p>
<p>Anyone who studies Soviet foreign policy admits that the foreign policy adopted by the Soviet Union in the past 30 years can be divided into three stages. From the success of the Soviet social revolution and the establishment of the Soviet government to the resignation of Foreign Minister Chicherin in 1930, this was the first stage of Soviet diplomacy. At that time, the Soviet Union was abandoned outside the international community. On the one hand, capitalist countries regarded the emerging Soviet Union as a flood, and they were on guard against its attempts to communize the world. Even the idea of ​​a joint attack on the Soviet Union by the great powers was prevalent for a time. On the other hand, the Soviet Union also chanted the theory of "world revolution," attempting to lead all the oppressed and small nations of the world to unite against imperialism. At that time, Lenin also said such a sentence: "Socialist countries and capitalist countries can never coexist at the same time. Either we communize the whole world, or the socialist country will be divided by capitalist countries."</p>
<p>But after Litvinov succeeded Chicherin as Foreign Minister in 1930, Soviet foreign policy underwent a 180-degree turn, not only abandoning the proposition of world revolution, but also openly calling for a "peaceful diplomatic policy." Litvinov used his flexible diplomatic skills to achieve amazing success in a few years, not only restoring diplomatic relations with capitalist countries one after another, but also concluding non-aggression treaties and mutual assistance treaties with France, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Finland, and the Baltic countries. In September 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations. When Litvinov stepped into the assembly hall of the League of Nations, he was warmly welcomed by representatives of various countries around the world, and he became a "peace angel." He first put forward the slogan of "peace is indivisible," which is still praised by people as the golden rule. But when Litvinov was suddenly dismissed in 1939 and succeeded by Molotov, Soviet diplomacy entered its third stage.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Molotov's tenure as Foreign Minister, the Soviet authorities repeatedly denied that there would be any changes in foreign policy; but objective facts proved that the Soviet Union had abandoned its peaceful diplomatic policy and adopted a "realist" diplomatic policy instead. The signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on August 24, 1939, was an excellent proof. Later, when World War II broke out, Molotov reported on the international situation, saying that "the current war has the nature of a scramble between imperialists" and believed that it was beneficial to the social revolution led by the Soviet Union, until the German army moved east and invaded the Soviet Union from Poland, then it suddenly realized that World War II was a war between aggressors and anti-aggressors, and the Soviet Union could only defeat the aggressors by working together with the United Nations. During the war, Molotov made great contributions to strengthening the unity and cooperation between the United Nations, but after the victory of the war, he could not escape considerable responsibility for the division of the world and the separation of the United States and the Soviet Union. Today, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union is intensifying, filling the international community with hostility and moving step by step towards a new international war. The crisis of World War III is imminent, and the United States has no choice but to take the initiative in diplomacy. The active implementation of the Marshall Plan, the vigorous promotion of regional security mechanisms, and the recent negotiation of the Atlantic Pact are ostensibly for peace, but are they not actually aimed at the Soviet Union? In addition, Norway's refusal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union and its firm desire to join the Atlantic Pact, and Denmark's similar tendency, further illustrate Molotov's failure in Europe. Under these circumstances, a change in Soviet diplomacy seems to be an inevitable trend. Molotov's dismissal may be a harbinger of a change of course in Soviet diplomacy.</p>
<p>Rumors of Molotov's dismissal have been around for a long time, and have been heard from time to time; the differences between Molotov and Stalin are also widely rumored. However, because we are outside the Iron Curtain, we do not know the Soviet political situation in great detail, so we dare not speculate. Now that Molotov has been dismissed, there is sufficient reason to believe that Soviet diplomacy, after Vyshinsky takes office, can be further unified under Stalin's sole authority. Vyshinsky is Molotov's powerful assistant, who often "engaged in verbal battles with the Confucian scholars" at United Nations conferences, showing his sharp edge, and even people in Western countries admired his skills; but he has no opinions on Soviet foreign policy, and even less ambition. In the future, he will only take Stalin's opinions as his own. Although Stalin's peace offensive has not been successful, it is foreseeable that Vyshinsky will continue to strengthen it for a period of time in the future.</p>
<h3>Naval Headquarters Dispatches Aircraft to Reconnoiter the Coast for the Chongqing Warship; Low Pay for Officers and Soldiers is the Main Reason for Defection</h3>
<p>Mr. Gui Yongqing's Remarks</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] After the disappearance of the Chongqing warship, the Naval Headquarters has obtained some information and is now dispatching aircraft to patrol the coast. On the morning of the 6th, Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing told reporters: There were about four or five hundred officers and soldiers on board the ship when it defected; one of the reasons for the defection was the dissatisfaction of the officers and soldiers with the excessively low pay. When they were training in England, they were paid in pounds. When they returned to China, they were treated as public education military personnel, and their lives were difficult. When the news of the ship's defection came out, he was in Anqing. He originally planned to return to Shanghai immediately, but he was unable to return due to official duties. Recently, he used wireless radio to broadcast to the officers and soldiers of the ship in English, asking them not to make the greatest mistake in history and to be ridiculed at home and abroad, and that all issues could be discussed. After the broadcast, he has not received a reply from the ship. He also said that no warship is allowed to move freely without the order of the Naval Headquarters. The ship's captain may have falsely claimed an order or used the excuse of training the army to leave the Wusongkou. When asked by reporters whether the ship had any possibility of returning, Mr. Gui replied: "We have not yet fallen into despair." When reporters asked about "the consequences that the ship's defection could cause," Mr. Gui did not answer.</p>
<p>Rumor is that it has Arrived in Dalian</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Second Fleet of the Navy told this agency in Zhenjiang that after the defection of the Chongqing cruiser, it added fuel in Yantai and has now arrived in Dalian. At the same time, Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing told reporters in Beijing that when the Chongqing sneaked out of the Yangtze River estuary a week ago, it deliberately sailed back and forth, seemingly testing the engine, in order to avoid the attention of the coastal battery. When it sailed outside the range of the battery, it accelerated north and escaped into the high seas.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The mystery of the disappearance of the naval cruiser Chongqing remained elusive on the 6th. The previous rumors that the ship had sailed north to Yantai and surrendered to the Chinese Communists were difficult to confirm, because government reconnaissance planes had twice gone to Yantai to reconnoiter, but had not found the ship.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Xining, 6th Dispatch] Due to the turmoil of the times and the exhaustion of funds, secondary education in Qinghai Province is gradually shrinking. Recently, the provincial government decided to merge the Datong Mutual Aid Normal School and the Guide Middle School into the Xining Normal Vocational School and the Xining Middle School, respectively. The Provincial Women's Normal School has also suspended high school. Elementary schools in the provincial capital have opened one after another, but the funding for the National Xining Normal School has not yet been settled, and all teachers and students are extremely anxious.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong's Imports and Exports Last Year Exceeded All Previous Records; HSBC Bank Manager Speaks at Board of Directors Meeting</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 5th Dispatch] HSBC Bank Manager Mr. Morse said at the bank's annual board meeting that those engaged in foreign trade in China will inevitably face a completely new situation in the coming years. However, Chinese and foreign merchants with experience in trade in China will not give up in disappointment. It is undeniable that China urgently needs to import consumer goods and production equipment, and needs to export goods in exchange for imports. Hong Kong's import and export trade in 1948 exceeded all previous records. In terms of value, it was three times that of 1938; in terms of quantity, it has recovered to pre-war standards. Foreign exchange control and export control have not affected the increase in trade. Last year, the total value of Hong Kong's trade with Japan and Korea was HK$56 million. Air transport has also expanded greatly. Last year, there were 227,000 air passengers, compared with only 28,000 in 1946. HSBC Bank's net profit for last year was HK$16,792,000, an increase of HK$278,000 compared with 1947. The balance under the settlement item was HK$2.665 billion, an increase of HK$244 million compared with 1947. The amount of banknotes in circulation at the end of last year was more than HK$728 million.</p>
<h3>Dazong Mediation Reaches the Outskirts of Yuanling; Negotiations with the Rebel People Begin; External Contact with Chenxi is Interrupted and the Situation is Chaotic</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 6th Dispatch] Yuanling telephone at 8 pm on the 6th: There was no war in Yuanling all day on the 6th. Provincial Security Deputy Commander Wang Jinxi and the Dazong mediation team led by Dai Jitao have arrived at Wangwangpo (3 li from the city). The rebel people sent people across the river to start negotiations with Dai and others. As of 8 pm, the negotiations were still in progress. Also, regarding the previous telegram about the instability of the 10th Regiment Commander Wang Yuanhua, according to accurate information, one battalion of Wang's troops is moving towards Dayong County, surrendering to Dayong County Chief Xu Junhu. Dayong is still peaceful. Another battalion was transferred to Chenxi to fight, while Wang himself is missing.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Huaihua telephone: The people of Chenxi are fleeing to Huaihua. External contact with Chen has been interrupted on the 6th, and the situation is chaotic. It is said that Changsha's evening newspapers and Shupu and Huaihua are all tense, which is completely inaccurate according to investigations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 6th Dispatch] This reporter recently visited Li Moan. He tried his best to avoid giving a positive answer to the Xiangxi incident, only saying that the chaotic situation in Xiangxi was not as serious as the rumors. Also, slogans denouncing Li Moan were posted all over Changde City. Li's return to the 17th Security District of Changde is quite problematic under the current situation.</p>
<h3>Fujian and Taiwan Exchange Materials; A Concrete Decision Has Been Made</h3>
<p>The First Batch is Timber in Exchange for Coal</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 6th Dispatch] A concrete decision has been made on the exchange of materials between Fujian and Taiwan provinces. The first batch of exchange materials is 9,000 tons of Taiwanese coal in exchange for timber of equal value from Fujian Province. This batch of coal can be used for three months, and the exchange can continue in the future. In addition, due to the impact of the times, the sale of timber and tea, which are special products of Fujian Province, to North China has been stagnant for a long time. Recently, a batch was transferred to the Communist area by a Shanghai ship sailing from Shanghai via Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Police Department Supplements Explanation on Entry Methods</h3>
<p>Permit Valid for Three Months</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 6th Dispatch] The temporary measures for the entry of military and public personnel and passengers formulated by the Taiwan Provincial Authorities were implemented on March 1. The Provincial Garrison Headquarters has specially released the following four supplementary points on the measures: (1) The term "and their family members" in Items 1 and 2 of Article 2 refers to direct relatives and must come to Taiwan with the military and public personnel at the same time. If the family members of military and public personnel come to Taiwan alone, they should be handled in accordance with general passengers. (2) The passenger entry permit referred to in Article 1 of Article 2 must be approved and issued by the Provincial Government and should be sent directly to the original applicant by the Police Department to save time. (3) The "document of proof issued by the Special Commissioner's Office of Guangdong and Guangxi for passengers coming to Taiwan from Hong Kong" referred to in Item 7 of Article 3 can only prove the identity of the passenger, and the applicant must still fill in the application form for entry passengers and submit it to the Special Commissioner's Office of Guangdong and Guangxi. The office will send it to the Provincial Police Department at any time, and after obtaining the entry passenger permit in accordance with these measures, they can enter Taiwan. The Special Commissioner's Office of Guangdong and Guangxi has been notified to handle it. (4) The validity period of the entry military and political personnel certificate and the entry passenger permit is three months and can only be used once and will be collected by the entry inspection personnel.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Province is Experiencing a Drought and Water Shortage, Resulting in a Sharp Decrease in Electricity</h3>
<p>If There is No Rain, Electricity Use Will Be Restricted</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 6th Dispatch] According to Sun Yunxuan, Director of the Mechanical and Electrical Department of the Provincial Electric Power Company, Taiwan's power system mostly uses hydropower, and its output depends on the amount of electricity. This year, the amount of electricity in Taiwan is scarce, even more so than the driest year in the past (the great drought in the spring of the 35th year of the Republic, according to statistics, was the first time in 100 years). According to the cumulative flow of the Zhuoshui River, the lowest in the past was 72,000 days (units), and this year it is 55,038 days (units). It is still difficult to predict how long this drought will last. The water stored in Sun Moon Lake is only more than ten feet. If there is no rain this month, from the beginning of April, electricity use throughout the province will be restricted by more than half. In order to cope with this serious situation, the company has begun to slightly reduce the weekly rate and voltage since the 2nd. At the same time, it calls on users throughout the province to avoid using electric stoves, automatically conserve electric lights, suspend advertising neon lights, and factories that can take advantage of this period to repair machines. Factories with automatic generators are encouraged to use them as much as possible to overcome the difficulties together. New factories moving to Taiwan may be affected by this and delay their start.</p>

He did not make a speech but adopted a free-flowing conversation format. The spring sunshine was bright, and the hosts and guests were all delighted. According to Zhou's words to reporters, Hangzhou relies on spring for three seasons' worth of income.

<h3>Soviet Supreme Decisions Controlled by Politburo; Basic Policies Unlikely to Change; Gromyko Promoted to First Deputy Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] Moscow Radio announced today that the Soviet Council of Ministers has appointed Gromyko as First Deputy Foreign Minister to succeed Vyshinsky after his promotion to Foreign Minister. Other Soviet Deputy Foreign Ministers are currently Zorin, Gusev, and Malik. Like Vyshinsky, Gromyko attracted worldwide attention for his speeches at United Nations conferences. Gromyko succeeded Litvinov as Ambassador to the United States in 1943 and served until April 1946.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Sources here believe that the change of Soviet Foreign Minister is merely a simple reorganization within the Soviet government and should not be seen as a surprising dismissal. A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment officially, but according to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, the British government is not yet willing to conclude that Molotov has been dismissed or that Soviet foreign policy is about to undergo a fundamental change. Judging from the simultaneous departure of Trade Minister Mikoyan, it can be seen that these two veteran Soviet politicians will now concentrate their efforts on assisting Stalin in the decision-making of the Soviet Communist Party's political strategy. Therefore, they have to get rid of the daily administrative affairs in the cabinet. British sources familiar with Soviet affairs believe that the dismissal of Molotov and Mikoyan from their cabinet posts is only an administrative reorganization. Therefore, rather than regarding them as dismissals, it would be better to call it promotions. After being relieved of their cabinet duties, they can devote all their energy to participating in top-level decision-making and also share the burden of Marshal Stalin, who is already 70 years old. Vyshinsky was in Czechoslovakia when he was transferred to his new post, so there is absolutely no possibility of him ousting Molotov to take his position. Vyshinsky's appointment as Foreign Minister is actually a demotion of the Foreign Ministry rather than a promotion of Vyshinsky. The change of the Minister of Foreign Trade is also the same.</p>
<p>Gromyko</p>
<h3>Future Soviet Foreign Policy Will Control the Asian Continent; U.S. State Department is Preparing Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] After Vyshinsky took office as Soviet Foreign Minister, the U.S. State Department worked as usual this weekend to prepare appropriate countermeasures on the U.S. side. The news that Vyshinsky happily attended a banquet to entertain North Korean representatives in his capacity as Foreign Minister added to the U.S.'s attention to this change of Soviet Foreign Minister. Washington has gradually come to believe that this change of Foreign Minister is a sign that the Soviet Union is shifting its position to Asia after the failure of its diplomacy in Western Europe.</p>
<p>State Department officials pointed out that Molotov's dismissal must be due to the Soviet government's deep understanding that it must immediately seek countermeasures against the trump card of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Molotov's policy of making every effort to win over Western Europe has proved fruitless to this day. Therefore, Vyshinsky's rise indicates that future Soviet foreign policy will reverse its past style and focus on Asia, placing Europe in a secondary position. Therefore, Vyshinsky's hosting of a grand banquet for the North Korean delegation at the beginning of his tenure as Foreign Minister is of considerable importance. An official here frankly predicted that Vyshinsky will definitely make up for the losses of communism in Europe by gaining ground in Asia in the future. Washington believes that the Soviet Union will intensify the war of ideologies in Asia and the Far East in the future to balance the equilibrium overturned by the North Atlantic Treaty. The Kremlin expects that the China problem will be resolved by the victory of the Communist Party this spring, and the Burmese government will inevitably collapse at that time. These two major changes will completely change the political situation in Asia and allow the Soviet Union to easily gain control of the Asian continent. Strategically speaking, the realization of these two major developments will wipe out the efforts of Britain and the United States in Asia.</p>
<h3>Change of Soviet Foreign Minister: New Wine in Old Bottles</h3>
<p>Vandenberg Issues Criticism</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] White House Secretary Hassett told reporters today that President Truman had no comment on the change of Soviet Foreign Minister. The President also did not mention Molotov's departure at his regular meeting with his aides today. Republican foreign policy leader Vandenberg commented that the change of Soviet Foreign Minister was merely the replacement of a cruel person with a heartless person. Molotov and Vyshinsky were the pair who spoke out the most against efforts to destroy peace.</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Pact Under Discussion; Greek Foreign Minister to Visit Turkey</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Athens Radio reported that Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris will discuss the possibility of establishing a Mediterranean Pact following the Greater Atlantic Pact.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Investigating Arrest of Soviet Engineer</h3>
<p>Pan Youxin Had Requested Release</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin visited U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Webb and Assistant Secretary of State Rusk today to request the release of Soviet engineer Gubichev, who was arrested for allegedly stealing U.S. government secret documents. However, the State Department told Pan that the department still needs to study this issue. Pan declined to comment to reporters after leaving the State Department. The Gubichev case seems to confirm the report of Alexander, Deputy Chief of the Passport Visa Section of the State Department, to a congressional committee last July, that hundreds of undesirable elements entered the United States under United Nations passports.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Moscow Radio today broadcast an editorial from the Red Star newspaper, saying that the recent speeches by Communist leaders from France, Italy, Britain, Germany, Norway, Mexico, and other countries show how strong the strength of peace-loving friends who oppose international reactionary forces has reached.

The ruling classes of Britain and the United States are engaged in uniting various aggressive blocs to find a way out of the economic crisis within capitalist countries.

<h3>Underground Movement Behind the Iron Curtain: Collecting Intelligence and Guiding Refugees to Flee; The "E" Symbol Discovered on the Streets of the Czech and Hungarian Capitals</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 6th] The English letter "E," which has been chalked on walls at night on the streets of Prague and Budapest, shows that the anti-Communist movement behind the Iron Curtain is growing, just like the "V" symbol during the war. The letter "E" represents the newly created "Europe of Unity and Freedom" movement. Refugees who have escaped from behind the Iron Curtain have been spreading the news of the birth of the resistance movement behind the Iron Curtain. Germany has become a distribution center for these refugees. Recently, secret meetings were held on the borders of two Communist countries to unite these refugees, and the participants were all figures who led isolated resistance movements. The "First Column," which is the resistance movement behind the Iron Curtain, was born because of this meeting. Its current strength is still not comparable to the underground movement during the war. Its main work is currently limited to collecting intelligence outside the Iron Curtain, issuing propaganda materials, and organizing the escape of refugees. It is reported that there are at least six secret newspapers in Poland, at least three in Hungary, and at least two in the Czech Republic. Underground workers in Poland have several short-wave radio stations to communicate news with foreign countries, and the "underground railway" in various Communist countries, which is an organization that guides refugees to flee, is also becoming more sophisticated. They use a chain system, with each refugee responsible for guiding a refugee, connecting station by station, until they reach a safe area. It is said that no more than 5% of the people who flee are arrested on the way, which shows the effectiveness of the system.</p>

<h3>Soaring Prices Need to Be Contained Urgently; Governor of the Central Bank Flies to Beijing to Discuss Countermeasures with the Minister of Finance; Will Return to Shanghai Today and Sell Gold, Silver, and Materials Again</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the announcement of the new financial and economic reform plan, the implementation details have not yet been published. At this time when decisions have not been made, speculators are taking the opportunity to manipulate the market. Prices first rose gradually and then soared. According to statistics, the increase rate of general prices in the past week was at least 50% and at most more than 100%. The lives of ordinary citizens are greatly threatened. Liu Gongyun, Governor of the Central Bank, therefore took a flight to Beijing in a hurry at around 8:00 AM yesterday. According to reporters, Liu is scheduled to return to Shanghai by evening train that day, so he should arrive at the North Station this morning. Although Liu did not state his mission on this trip, it is widely believed that he will seek another effective remedy from Finance Minister Xu to address the current situation of price fluctuations in Shanghai. The details are roughly as follows: (1) How to continue to implement the Central Bank's selling policy (including gauze, sugar, rayon, raw silk, gold and silver, foreign exchange transfer certificates, gold bonds, stocks of state-owned enterprises, etc.). (2) How to restore and organize the gold and silver markets that have been closed for a long time. (3) How to overcome the various practical difficulties caused by the actual collection of commodity taxes. (4) How to improve the pricing issues of public utilities. Observing Liu's hurried trip, regardless of whether Finance Minister Xu can immediately grant all the effective remedies, it is widely believed that the Central Bank will have a temporary emergency measure for its movements in the market from today onwards to combat this direct upward surge. At the same time, it is generally believed that Liu's trip will have some remedial and decisive impact on the implementation details of the financial and economic reform plan that will be announced soon.</p>

<h3>Shanghai and Taiwan Have Long Had Arbitrage Transactions; Black Market Exchange Rate is One to Eighteen</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that since Taiwan Province banned the exchange of funds between Taiwan Province and various provinces in the country, the remittance of funds for the industrial and commercial sectors has become very inconvenient. However, those who import materials into Taiwan Province can remit part of the payment through the official exchange rate, but the amount is very limited. Affected by this, the arbitrage transactions between this city and Taiwan Province have emerged. It is said that those who operate in this way, in addition to small banks and shops that have long had connections with Taiwan Province, many companies that have dealings with various places in Taiwan Province also adjust the remittance of funds in both places through account transfers. However, since the funds remitted from Taiwan are more than the funds remitted from Shanghai to Taiwan, the official exchange rate is 10 Taiwan dollars per Gold Yuan, while the black market exchange rate is about 18 Taiwan dollars per Gold Yuan.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Telegram on Cotton Stock Exhaustion, Cotton Textile Industry Authority Analyzes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A Hong Kong telegram reported that the cotton stock of yarn factories in this city is only sufficient for consumption until the end of this month and will be completely used up. Yesterday, the reporter consulted a certain authority in the cotton textile industry in this city for his opinion on the news. According to him, this news may refer to the current situation of some private yarn factories in this city. Some private yarn factories in this city had transferred their funds abroad successively due to the critical situation in the Jinghu area, resulting in a decrease in funds to replenish raw cotton. Moreover, the overall situation is still uncertain, so the business policy of each factory has not been clearly determined. Most factories tend to purchase raw materials in succession when needed and stop when not needed, resulting in a significant reduction in the raw cotton stock of each factory. According to general estimates, the cotton stock of each private factory in Shanghai is roughly sufficient to continue operating for one and a half months. The raw cotton stock of each factory under the State-owned Textile Construction Company is relatively abundant. In addition to its own stock, plus the raw cotton obtained from the export of yarn and cloth, the raw cotton entrusted by the US Aid Cotton Committee to spin cotton yarn, and the raw cotton entrusted by the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office, it is estimated that the cotton stock is sufficient to continue operating for three months. Recently, the company will receive a third batch of approximately 28,000 bales of US aid cotton (500 pounds per bale), so the raw cotton supply will not be panicked for the time being. Recently, due to the abundance of raw cotton sources, the general operating system of each factory under the company has been changed to five days and six nights per week from this month onwards in order to increase the supply of yarn and cloth and stabilize the price of yarn and cloth.</p>

<h3>Shanghai and Changzhou are Conducting Exchanges of Materials between the Nationalist and Communist Areas, Personnel are Now Being Sent to Discuss Technicalities</h3>
<p>[Our Report, Wuxi, 5th] Ever since the peace envoys returned to the south, issues regarding transport and material exchange between the Government-controlled regions and the Communist regions have begun to show signs of progress. Reportedly, after the Shanghai National Products Ten Factories Export Office General Manager Qian Chengxu sent personnel as representatives of the production sector in Jinghu to make contact with the commercial sector in the Communist region, the latest news is that progress has been made with the exchange of materials between Xuhuai and Jiangnan. At the same time, Xu Huai Products Joint Operating Company General Manager Ning Huage, Anhui Enterprise Company Executive Director Lu Yizhai, Bengbu Daming Company General Manager Jiang Yaoxuan and others have successively gone to Shanghai via intermediary routes to meet with Qian, expressing that there are large quantities of cotton, wheat, and coal in Xuhuai and other places that can be exchanged. Qian made a special trip to Nanjing to report to the authorities and, upon returning to Shanghai, proposed discussions with the Wujin County Chamber of Commerce. Reportedly, the Wujin side plans to provide 10,000 bolts of twill white cloth in exchange for cotton, soybeans, and coal, while the Shanghai side plans to provide national product finished goods, such as new medicines, cotton fabrics, dyes, electrical appliances, sugar, and yarn, in exchange for cotton and coal. Combining the amounts from Shanghai and Changzhou, the initial back and forth can barely cope. As for the location of the exchange, Nanjing determined it to be Jingjiang. However, because Jiangyin is closer to Xichang, it is more cost-effective to use Xisha, and it is also more convenient to transport back cotton, so Qian Sunqing, Chairman of the Local County Chamber of Commerce, was sent a special letter yesterday, reviewing the process and hoping that Xichang would take consistent action, because production is currently facing extreme difficulties, and fuel coal and raw cotton are even more scarce. At the same time, Qian was asked to discuss the details with Rong Desheng for an exchange of opinions. As for technical issues, Shanghai has dispatched a special envoy on the 2nd of this month to Xu Huai to formally discuss the matter with commercial representatives from the Communist region, and they will be able to return to Shanghai to report in the next few days. According to the reporter's words from Chairman Qian, due to the fact that there are many factories in the town and all raw materials need to be circulated urgently, they are conducting careful research. As soon as the details of the material exchange are decided, they will be announced publicly.</p>

He believed that the basic mission of scientific periodicals is to popularize scientific knowledge to the public, starting from explaining scientific principles and then promoting it to striving for democracy and freedom. In today's Chinese society, the value of popularizing the true meaning of science is far greater than the popularization of applied scientific achievements. This is: demanding freedom and impartiality, rejecting secrecy and selfishness, recognizing the truth, and not asking about authority and power. Scientific periodicals should shoulder the task of the times by targeting the shortcomings of today's Chinese society, teaching the public to clearly understand the true meaning of science, distinguish right from wrong, not ask about power, demand freedom, and reject autocracy. This task far exceeds the mere popularization of technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Mao Yisheng gave a speech on "The Mission of Scientific Periodicals," and put forward four hopes to the colleagues of scientific periodicals: (1) Each periodical should have at least one person engaged in its industry for life. (2) Each periodical should have its focus of effort. (3) The publication periods should be coordinated with each other, and those of the same type should not be published at the same time. (4) Apply unified terminology. He also hoped that through the efforts of Chinese scientific periodicals, all aspects of Chinese politics and economics would have a scientific spirit.</p>
<p>Guest Xu Junyuan delivered a speech, believing that scientific publications should go to the countryside, and that the lack of popular education is also one of the reasons why scientific publications are not selling well. He hoped that newspapers could establish connections with publications in the future. Zhao Shikang also emphasized that science should penetrate into the countryside and industrialize the countryside. Qiu Weiyu believes that the methods of popularizing science education should include holding more mobile science lectures and screening science films. After the guests finished their speeches, they continued to elect and photograph, and the printing industry hosted a lunch. In the afternoon, the annual meeting was held again at the China Textile Society on Dihua Middle Road for a special discussion, presided over by Qiu Weiyu and Chen Pingcheng, and the topic of discussion was "The Future Mission of Chinese Science Periodicals." Then Zhang Mengwen presided over the discussion of association affairs. In the evening, the textile industry hosted a dinner, with a lottery for extra fun.</p>

<h3>City Hall "Miracle": The Tragic Lives of Low-Level Civil Servants - Section Chief Eats Noodles, Laborers Sleep on the Floor, Unable to Support Children, They Are Sent to Orphanages</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] The City Hall building, standing at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road, is the heart of Shanghai. All official documents related to municipal construction flow through it daily, like blood circulating through arteries and veins. The rhythmic beating of this heart sustains the prosperity of this international city. But today, it is suffering from severe anemia. If not treated promptly, its cells will soon die. One can easily imagine the disastrous consequences for Shanghai if the heart stops working. Living in this magnificent building are over a thousand people under Mayor Wu Guozhen. They sit in this building from morning to night, regardless of the fact that the cost of living has jumped to 643 times its original level. After the announcement of the new economic plan, prices have soared again, and public utilities are chasing after the U.S. dollar. Yet, to this day, their salaries are still calculated based on the government's announced cost-of-living index for civil servants, which is 75 times the base salary. This reporter specifically calculated that Mayor Wu's monthly salary is 17,400 Gold Yuan. The salaries of lower-level civil servants below the mayor are mostly less than 10,000 Yuan, and what about the laborers with a base salary of 60 Yuan? Today, they receive 4,500 Gold Yuan.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Salary - Barely Enough to Buy a Pair of Socks</p>
<p>I remember once asking Mayor Wu, "How do you spend this little money you get?" The mayor replied with a smile, "I give it all to my wife." In fact, the mayor's salary is only enough for his wife to buy a pair of silk stockings. However, no one worries about the mayor's livelihood. But how do those lower-level civil servants who earn a few thousand Yuan a month live? In other words, how does the group sitting on the cold bench in the "cold palace" survive? Isn't this a "miracle"? I believe curious people would certainly like to know how this "miracle" is produced…</p>
<p>A year ago, there was a section chief named Wei Xiaogang in the News Department of the Municipal Government. Perhaps few people knew him then, and it is even harder for anyone to remember him now, because he has long become a victim of this "miracle." Section Chief Wei was tall, wore a pair of thick tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, and sat at his desk all day, wielding his pen. He was skilled in drafting official documents and had beautiful handwriting. He was actually in his forties, but he looked at least fifty due to his aged appearance, and he was still a bachelor. Wei Xiaogang was by no means a dull and repulsive old curmudgeon. He was a normal person with reasonable needs, but the unreasonable reality deprived him of them. Those close to him often heard his theories on love, proclaiming everywhere that he wanted to form an alliance to pursue love, with himself as the leader, and he made many allies.</p>
<p>Office Desk by Day, Bed by Night</p>
<p>I remember that news reporters who covered city hall news at that time loved his sense of humor and often enjoyed chatting with him. Sometimes when we talked late into the night in the news office, we would suggest going to a restaurant for a "dragonfly touching its tail," which meant everyone paid for themselves. At such times, he would always slip away because he couldn't afford it. He would secretly sneak to the beef noodle stall on Erma Road to eat his plain noodles, which was his usual dinner. After finishing, he would return to city hall, feeling his way up the dark stairs, and sleep on the desk where he worked during the day. That was his home. In the newsroom closet, there was a tattered cotton quilt that hadn't been washed in two years, which was the precious item that kept him warm every night. The next morning, he would get up, wash his face with cold water, and sit at his desk as usual, doing those monotonous tasks like a machine, never missing a shift. One day, Section Chief Wei suddenly disappeared. It was said that he was sick. Not long after, news of his death came. Of course, this bad news didn't cause a sensation in city hall, because he was just an ordinary section chief. Although if you went to the personnel department to check, you would know that being a section chief is not easy. One needs a university degree and experience as a senior clerk in a government agency. Now Section Chief Wei is dead. He was swallowed up by a hellish life. If he were still alive, wouldn't he be an example of a "miracle"?</p>
<p>700 Last Month, Haven't Received This Month's Yet</p>
<p>Wei Xiaogang was a section chief. Today, a section chief can still receive about 10,000 Yuan. So how can lower-level employees, who are even worse off than section chiefs, survive? To uncover the root of this "miracle," this reporter also interviewed a city hall laborer. He is 34 years old, originally from Hebei Province. During the Anti-Japanese War, he enlisted in the army and fought on the front lines in Zhabei twice. After the victory, he was introduced to work as a laborer in city hall. He cleans the offices during the day and sleeps on the floor at night. He eats one porridge and two meals a day in the city hall cafeteria, because it is run by the Employee Welfare Committee and the prices are much cheaper. But after paying for his meals, there is very little money left. Sometimes he can't even afford to get a haircut or take a bath, and he always borrows from his colleagues. He said that last month he received a salary of 700 Yuan, and he hasn't received this month's yet. He sighed and said, "I can only live one day at a time, hoping not to starve to death." Fortunately, neither Section Chief Wei nor this laborer had a family (although they were both of marriageable age), so they only had to feed themselves. But what about those civil servants who have families and many children? What kind of "miracle" do they have?</p>
<p>Monthly Salary of 4,000-5,000 - Not Even Enough to Buy Noodles</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper from two days ago, there was a shocking record on the local news page: "Yesterday, a civil servant in this city, unable to make ends meet, reluctantly sent his four children to the Taixing Road Women's Rehabilitation Center, requesting relief. The situation is extremely tragic. Mr. Huang, who received higher education and has served in a government agency in this city for many years, currently lives in the city hall employee dormitory. His monthly salary is 4,000-5,000 Yuan, and he receives three dou of rationed rice. This meager amount is not even enough for a family to buy plain boiled noodles. He cannot afford the tuition, which is calculated in rice per student. This civil servant resolutely took his daughters Huang Xiaoqing (7 years old, second grade), Huang Dongchan (11 years old, fifth grade), Huang Lingzhu (12 years old), and Huang Suzhen (14 years old, sixth grade) to the rehabilitation center. The children cried and told people, 'Mom took two younger brothers and was evacuated to the countryside in Hangzhou, so Dad can live well in Shanghai.' The father separated from his daughters with tears in his eyes. When leaving, the director of the rehabilitation center told him, 'We don't have advanced classes here, so the older children's schooling will be a problem.' The civil servant smiled bitterly and replied, 'Now we can't talk about schooling or not. We just need to fill our stomachs.'"</p>
<p>Too tragic, there is no need to expect any more miracles. This kind of life is already a "miracle" in human history! Who is without natural feelings? What parent in the world can bear to be separated from their own flesh and blood? Today, the lives of civil servants are indeed in dire straits. They have reached the point where they cannot survive even by tightening their belts. If reasonable improvements are not made in time, it is expected that all kinds of tragic "miracles" will continue to emerge, and the consequences will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Now, the magnificent City Hall building has become a dark hell on earth, with groups of civil servants struggling on the brink of death. May the ruling officials have mercy!</p>

<h3>All England Badminton Championships Conclude: Malayan Chinese Doubles Unparalleled in the World, Freeman Defeats Wong Peng Soon Again, Still Maintains Singles Throne</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 5th (Radio): The champions of the five titles of the All England Badminton Championships have been determined after four days of intense competition among 178 players. Malaya and China won the men's doubles, the United States won the men's singles and mixed doubles, Denmark won the women's singles, and England won the women's doubles.</p>
<p>Today, the Haringey Arena was attended by 7,000 spectators. In the first event, the women's singles final, Miss Kirsten Thorndahl of Denmark, after a three-game battle, defeated her doubles partner Miss Tonny Ahm 8-11, 11-8, 11-4, winning the championship.</p>
<p>Although Freeman defeated Wong Peng Soon 15-1, 15-6 to dominate the men's singles, the intensity of the battle was unprecedented for the young doctor who has been undefeated since the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>Wong Peng Soon was still abnormal at the beginning of the game, and Freeman easily scored nine points in a row. After that, Wong Peng Soon began to be smoother, forcing Freeman to go through a period of struggle for every point. Later, when Wong Peng Soon pulled back a point with a very beautiful and accurate smash, Freeman's racket was too long to reach, and he even cried out.</p>
<p>Wong Peng Soon had an excellent performance in the second game, once forcing Freeman to be at a disadvantage with 5-4. Unfortunately, he gradually showed fatigue after that, and Freeman took the opportunity to counterattack, winning seven points in a row. Although Wong Peng Soon tried to struggle, it was only a flash in the pan, and he lost 6-15. Freeman thus stepped onto the throne of the world badminton world. According to this All England Championship, all the players representing Malaya, China, the United States, Denmark, India and other places to participate in the Thomas Cup International Tournament are included, so the champion of the competition is also the world champion.</p>
<p>In the women's doubles final, Mrs. Uvarova and Miss Allen of England defeated the defending champions of the previous tournament, Mrs. Ahm and Miss Sander of Denmark, with 15-8 and 15-10.</p>
<p>The men's doubles championship was won by Wong Peng Soon and Chong Cheng Koon. The opponents were Freeman and Rogers, who were defeated in the Thomas Cup. At the beginning of the game, the American team took a 4-0 lead, but Wong and Chong of Malaya immediately rose up, chasing to 4-4. After that, they avoided the heavy and attacked the weakness of Rogers' defense, and the strategy worked. Soon they won the first game 15-5.</p>
<p>In the second game, the Malayan Chinese team continued to be vigorous, not giving Freeman a chance to show his skills, and won again with 15-4.</p>
<p>According to the men's doubles semi-final, the Yang Teh Tsai and Tseng Kuan Liang team was eliminated by Freeman and Rogers with 15-5, 5-15, 15-4. The Lin Kee Fong and Ong Poh Lim team of Malaya were defeated by Wong and Chong in the same room with 2-1.</p>
<p>The last event, mixed doubles, was won by Mr. and Mrs. Stephens of the United States. The Stephens couple relied on their excellent tacit understanding to overwhelm the American-British Allied Forces of Rogers and Miss Chilver with 15-5, 5-15, 15-12.</p>
<h3>By One Point, Hua Lian Loses to Foreign Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Last night in the A1 group of the basketball league, the overlord Hua Lian was tragically defeated by the U.S. Navy Pfeiffer by one point. The score was 44-43. In the first half, Hua Lian led by two points, 23-21. The main reason for the victory or defeat lies in the words "spirit" and "strength". Hua Lian seemed to underestimate the opponent at the beginning of the battle, but it was too late when Pfeiffer gained the upper hand. This is enough to give Hua Lian a lesson. The performance of the black player Brown of the other side was very moving.</p>
<p>In the women's group, the Green team won the Li team by a large margin with 49-13, and the A2 Fat team won Jian Le with 42-35.</p>

<h3>Railway Uses All Its Might, Defeats Zhi Chao 3-1, Will Compete with China Aviation for the Championship This Weekend</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] In another match of the Mayor's Cup Football Tournament, the railway team, with its average talents and flexible coordination, fought hard for 90 minutes and finally eliminated Zhi Chao 3-1, winning the right to the final. Under the leadership of Gao Baozheng, the railway team's forwards and defenders are indeed better. Although Zhi Chao has Wu Qixiang sitting in the center, it is difficult for him to fight alone. The whole team lacks stamina and is unable to reverse the situation. Yesterday, the weather was sunny and spring was full of vigor. More than 3,000 fans were in high spirits. The referee was Zhang Le, and the linesmen were Wu Shouheng and Lu Shunde. The railway team and China Aviation will compete for the Mayor's Cup championship this weekend.</p>
<p>The railway team attacked first, and Lu Qingxiang approached the door directly. Wu Qixiang fired a cannon head-on, repelling the enemy. Zhi Chao counterattacked, and Qian Yuanqing and Zhu Jiazheng attacked from the left, returning without success. Zhu Chengjiao sent a high ball far away. Yu Qia and Xiang rushed straight to the railway gate. Liao Xiong rushed out, Gao Baozheng restrained them, Xu Dawei pulled, and the ball flew out of bounds. The railway team attacked, Cao Liming sent the ball, Wu Binghao headed it, and Sheng Peter hugged it full. The railway team fought back, Lu Bingsheng passed forward, Xiao Ziwen headed, but it was not successful. This back and forth, stalemate for 36 minutes, Lin Dianyi attacked straight along the side, kicked it accidentally, Zhang Jie kicked and the ball fell, and the railway team took the lead 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, the railway team's offensive became more intense. The tug-of-war situation in the first half gradually changed. Half an hour passed, Xiao Ziwen got the ball later, and Wu Qixiang was actually deceived, making another contribution. The railway team took a 2-0 advantage. Wu Qixiang worked hard to strengthen himself, and personally led the expedition, opening to the front line, and exchanging positions with Xu Guoping. However, the young generals under his command were already exhausted, and Ziwen took the opportunity to come again. One kick hit the post and bounced out, Lu Qingxiang rushed up and kicked it in, and the score became three straight. The big labor has gone, Zhi Chao borrowed a city, attacking endlessly. Outside the railway gate, Cao Liming touched the football with his hand and was sentenced to a free kick. Zhi Chao Lu Yide sent it, urgently and far away, Shang Shiqi picked over Yue Renxiao, Wu Qixiang approached the gate and chained it, the ball entered the white line, Zhi Chao pulled back a goal, Zhu ate a duck egg, 3-1 ending.</p>

<h3>Sports World Post-Railway War Review</h3>
<p>Watching the railway team and Zhi Chao compete is like watching Wu Qixiang and Gao Baozheng fighting. However, Baozheng is cheaper in that the collocation is more complete, while Qixiang is only able to support the building, before and after, he must rely on one person to support it. Peony is difficult to be good, and green leaves are still needed to support it. Some people say that if Zhi Chao had two Wu Qixiang, one in the front and one in the back, it would be good.</p>
<p>Although Zhi Qi is a new army, under the influence of Wu Qixiang, it has improved a lot compared to the beginning of the season. This is due to Qixiang's contribution.</p>
<p>In the heyday of Qingbai, the current strong generals have been scattered. Baozheng leads the railway, Qixiang supports Zhi Chao, Gao Xiuqing is the pillar of China Aviation, and Wu Kaimin is also the main general of the Dragon Head. Only Meng Yiliang is left in Qingbai, and he is promoting his successors. If Yan Shixin comes to organize a bank fellow team next season, and Afu also changes to another team, then it would be interesting to have old friends of Qingbai as the main brain of each team.</p>
<p>Shang Shihong on Zhi Chao's right wing performed well in the first half, with speed and brains, but the disease is that the position is too backward and refuses to go deep. In the second half, his strength was exhausted, and his activities were greatly reduced as a result.</p>
<p>Jiang Lei is also visible, but when the enemy's peak gets the ball, he retreats too quickly, so the defense zone is forced to shrink. If the enemy's peak has a good long shot, then it is not his fault that he has made a contribution.</p>
<p>The intermediate avant-garde of the railway team has a tacit understanding and good cooperation, which is quite salty. Zhang Jie has speed, and Xiao Lu assisted in the promotion, forming a small triangle in the middle. Wu Binghao on the left wing passed with a way, but the speed was not enough. Lin Dianyi on the right wing had speed, but he could only go straight forward. He would pass from a long distance, so some people say that the railway team's attack is a dimensional attack, or a central breakthrough.</p>
<p>The Mayor's Cup Qingbai suffered an unexpected poison, and the railway's fortune came suddenly. It is hoped that this cup will be touched. However, it is said that China Aviation has borrowed generals from Xiangdao, so it is difficult to rest easy when strong enemies are in front of us.</p>
<p>The penalty kick king "Zhang Le" enforced the law, but did not award a penalty kick once, which shows that the two sides kicked very politely. (Qiu Shigong)</p>

<h3>Spiritual Therapy to Cure Gambling Addiction</h3>
<p>— Zhuxi</p>
<p>There is a great mind scientist in the United States named Harre Zola, who has an amazing ability to observe the mind. He has a particularly sensitive memory for numbers. You can write a number in each of the fifteen squares on a large grid, and Harre only needs to glance at it to be able to recite those numbers one by one in order, without any mistakes. He can also use mental arithmetic to add up the numbers in each horizontal or vertical row. Some mathematicians one day brought a calculator specifically to compare the speed of calculation with him, and the result was: the calculator could not keep up with him.</p>
<p>Harre performed magic tricks at amusement fairs, earning $2,000 a week, but he was still not satisfied. He thought: Why can't he use his brainpower in a more profitable setting? So he started gambling.</p>
<p>Isn't gambling just a scientific application of the law of chance? Who can calculate these laws of chance more accurately than a great mathematician? When a die rolls a four, what is the chance of rolling it again? Harre knows this. He can calculate it to several decimal places. But the fly in the ointment is that the winner never belongs to Harre. His explanation is: "If I could bet one more time, I would definitely win, but unfortunately I have run out of money."</p>
<p>The money that Harre earned from his mathematical talent was sent to the gambling table. He calculated that he had lost a total of $167,438.50.</p>
<p>Psychologists studied his memory methods and mathematical abilities, and at first they did not understand why such an intellectually gifted person was so easily deceived. But later they realized that gambling had become a habit for Harre, like an addiction.</p>
<p>Dr. Brugler, a psychiatrist in New York, once did some research on this and came to the conclusion that gamblers who are addicted to gambling are neuropathic patients who cannot control their behavior. Later, they take pleasure in pain and delight in loss.</p>
<p>A certain authoritative scholar once said that a gambler is an unrepentant and incurable offender. But psychiatrists mostly disagree. They believe that gamblers can be cured with psychiatric therapy, but it is often easier to persuade an alcoholic or drug addict to change than it is to persuade a gambler to change his ways. According to Brugler, gamblers have the following six characteristics:</p>
<p>1. Gamblers have a habitual tendency to take risks and speculate;</p>
<p>2. The fun of gambling is higher than all other fun, and his thoughts are all focused on gambling;</p>
<p>3. Gamblers are often optimistic and are not discouraged by failure;</p>
<p>4. Gamblers are reluctant to stop when they win money, and are reluctant to quit when they lose money.</p>
<p>5. Although they start carefully, they later do not hesitate to put all their eggs in one basket, and can bet on the rent they have to pay, the food expenses for next month, the money entrusted to them by others, or the public funds they handle.</p>
<p>6. In the period after betting and before the outcome is revealed, the gambler has a happy and painful tension and excitement. It can be said that gamblers enter the game in order to win money, or in order to "make a profit," but in fact, this is often not the case, but a desire to pursue mental stimulation.</p>
<p>The only way to treat gamblers is with psychiatric therapy. If there is an opportunity to find out where the root of the disease lies, treating the gambling disease with psychiatric treatment can often be effective. When the patient realizes that gambling is a hobby that wants to harm others or harm himself, he will begin to realize it, and will eventually have the perseverance to quit gambling one day.</p>
<h3>That's How It Is</h3>
<p>At a night dance, a beautiful young lady had a gold chain around her neck, from which hung a small, exquisite gold airplane. A young man stared at it.</p>
<p>"Do you admire this little airplane?" the lady asked. "No, miss," the young man replied. "I admire this landing strip." (Li)</p>
<h3>Legends About Women</h3>
<p>— Lan Ning</p>
<p>There is an ancient myth in Sanskrit classics that when the heavens and earth were first created, the world was created by the great god. He used various elements to create the sun, the light and stars, the valleys and forests, and finally man.</p>
<p>All the solid materials had been used up in creating man, so when he wanted to create woman, he had nothing left. The great god then gathered the roundness of the moon, the trembling of the water snake, the winding of the kudzu vine, the slenderness of the rose vine, the delicacy of the flowers, the lightness of the green leaves, the swiftness of the fawn, the brightness of the sunlight, the fine tears of the mist, the fleetingness of the breeze, the timidity of the wild rabbit, the vanity of the peacock, the softness of velvet, the hardness of diamonds, the sweetness of honey, the cruelty of the tiger, the warmth of fire, the cold of snow, the garrulousness of the starling, the melodiousness of the turtledove... He mixed all these together and created woman. He gave woman to man as a companion.</p>
<p>Thus, man's life was filled with joy because he now had someone to share the pleasures of the world with. Together they strolled on the pine-covered meadows, listened to the songs of the birds, and held hands watching the sunrise. At dusk, they marveled together at the ever-changing clouds in the sky after sunset.</p>
<p>But after some time, the man went to see the great god and said:</p>
<p>"Take her back, take back that woman you gave me, because she poisons my existence. She nags constantly all day long, eroding my time, preventing me from completing the more glorious and sacred tasks I aspire to accomplish. She often cries for no reason, and she is often ill."</p>
<p>So the great god took her back. But eight days later, the man appeared before the great god again.</p>
<p>"God," he said, "how lonely my life is since that woman left. Give her back to me! Because I remember her light figure dancing before me, I remember her sweet laughter filling my heart with joy. I remember how she nestled against me, and how sweet and comforting her presence was when the sun set, the day's work was done, and darkness surrounded me."</p>
<p>So the great god sent the woman back to him. However, after only a month, the man came to plead with him again.</p>
<p>"God," he said, "I don't know what it is. I don't understand, but I do know that that woman gives me more harassment and trouble than joy. I beg you, great god, take her back again."</p>
<p>The great god replied, "Go back, do your best to get along with her."</p>
<p>"But I really can't live with her anymore."</p>
<p>"However, you cannot live without her either," God concluded.</p>
<p>This conclusion is said to have not changed to this day.</p>
<h3>On "Song of the Forest"</h3>
<p>— Wang Ce</p>
<p>Before introducing "Song of the Forest", let me briefly mention "The Red Shoes" released by "English Lion", which has a similar theme. "The Red Shoes" tells the story of a ballet dancer who, after falling in love, cannot balance her career, leading to suicide by jumping off a building. The whole play is full of melancholy and dreaminess, it brings tears to the eyes, and also makes people sigh at the fate of artists. In addition, the color, lighting, and scene changes in the film are extremely magnificent. In American and British films, it is well-loved.</p>
<p>However, the new Soviet film "Song of the Forest", which has a similar story to "The Red Shoes", clearly has a great difference in theme from "The Red Shoes". "The Red Shoes" represents individualism and decadence. For all musicians, artists, and dancers, when measuring art and love, the individual's "weight" is much stronger than other factors. The heroine of "The Red Shoes" is reluctant to give up her lover, cannot let go of dancing, and ultimately commits suicide. Her ending is certainly tragic, but limited to individualistic sorrow.</p>
<p>And the musician in "Song of the Forest" does not put love in the first place. Although his hand was injured in the war, making it impossible to play the piano, he resolutely picked up the accordion, hid far away in the Siberian forest, sang for the broad masses of the people, and wrote more meaningful music for people who truly love music.</p>
<p>Just as the female singer Natasha condemns another accordion player in the play:</p>
<p>"You only know yourselves, you are selfish and self-serving. Although you are a famous pianist, what relationship do you have with the people?" (General idea)</p>
<p>China has no shortage of many academic musicians who indulge themselves in ivory towers, listen!</p>
<p>The folk-style chorus in "Song of the Forest" is the essence of the entire film and is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>The Chinese dialogue always feels inappropriate. With a red-haired, blue-eyed person, even if the Mandarin is spoken well, the audience will burst into laughter in many serious scenes. This dubbing method, I personally think, is not advisable.</p>
<h3>My Humble Suggestions</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>In order to implement the "Financial Reform Plan", to suppress prices, stabilize finance, and benefit the people's livelihood, I solemnly put forward a "well-intentioned" and "constructive" proposal. If adopted, the country will be "fortunate" and the people will be "fortunate"!</p>
<p>(1) The market price of gold dollar banknotes is rising very quickly. In order to prevent public utilities from suffering major losses, it is proposed that the "unit pricing" system of "only raising prices once a day" be amended immediately, that is: adjust according to the market price of gold dollar banknotes on the same day, making "dynamic adjustments" at any time.</p>
<p>(2) In order to show that "the common people are also allowed to light lanterns" and to advocate democracy, the fees for all public places (such as cinemas, theaters, game halls, restaurants, bathhouses, hotels...) and the prices of all shops and vendors can be adjusted dynamically at any time according to the "scientific method" adopted by the above-mentioned public utilities. But in any case, it is not allowed to directly price and pay in Guan Yuan, silver dollars, US dollars, or Hong Kong dollars, because the gold yuan coupon "is still the only legal currency." This point must be strictly observed to maintain currency credibility and benefit the people's livelihood. Those who dare to deliberately violate it will be severely punished without leniency.</p>
<p>(3) In order to reduce the burden on the national treasury, take into account the difficulties of manufacturers, and prevent foreign-run electric lights, trams, and water plants from making too little profit, all public teachers and professional workers' salaries shall be discounted according to the original practice, according to the current or previous index, and paid in one lump sum, without supplementation. Those who make excessive demands, take the opportunity to raise treatment, or conspire to riot will be sent to the security organs and severely punished in accordance with martial law to serve as a warning to others!</p>
<h3>Tit for Tat</h3>
<p>When the famous playwright George Bernard Shaw's masterpiece "Man and Superman" was first performed in New York by a famous theater troupe, it was a huge success and attracted a large crowd. The next day, the director received a call from Shaw:</p>
<p>"Wonderful!"</p>
<p>The director replied to Shaw: "You're too kind, not necessarily!"</p>
<p>The next day, the director received another call from Shaw:</p>
<p>"I was talking about the script!"</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Shaw also received a reply from the director:</p>
<p>"I was also talking about the script."</p>
<h3>"The Moon and Sixpence"</h3>
<p>— Xia Lin</p>
<p>The atmosphere in Shanghai is really too depressing, let's talk about something else.</p>
<p>"Golden Gate" has been showing "The Passionate Sinner", a film adapted from the novel by British writer W. Somerset Maugham, since last Saturday. Maugham is not an unfamiliar name in China. His works that have been adapted into films by Hollywood, such as "The Letter", "Rain", "Of Human Bondage", and "The Razor's Edge", which has not yet arrived in Shanghai, are all related to "The Passionate Sinner". It is based on "The Moon and Sixpence", which is Maugham's famous work (1919). The protagonist Strickland in the novel was originally a stockbroker in London. Because he was fascinated by art, he abandoned his family and went to the Latin Quarter of Paris, where he experienced a series of turbulent romances, and finally found the natural beauty he was pursuing on a coral island in the South Seas. The story is quite similar to the life of the modern French painter Gauguin, so some people say that Maugham had a picture of Gauguin in his mind when he wrote "The Moon and Sixpence". But Maugham did not admit it, so of course no one can prove it. Maugham's latest book is a religious novel "Catalina" published last year, which was serialized in Harper's Bazaar.</p>
<p>"Naoxin Jiujiu has become a center for music and dance. The Municipal Symphony Orchestra holds performances here every two weeks, and English ABC plays are performed here. Whether it's a drama, a concert, or even Yue opera, everyone wants to compete for this venue. Half of the reason is, of course, that there are no fixed tasks here, and half is because this art palace with historical significance is most suitable for song, dance, and drama performances. This Thursday (the 10th), the Shancheng Chorus, which has come from afar, will perform the opera "Love of the Sea" here. According to Wang Yunjie, the music director of the troupe, this is a new attempt based on the Italian opera format. "Love of the Sea" is based on Loti's novel "An Iceland Fisherman", composed by Feng Dun and directed by Zhu Chongmao and Jin Ge. The Shancheng Chorus is said to have been an amateur organization in Chongqing during the War of Resistance, a group formed by young people who endured hunger and worked hard for art. The economic foundation of "Love of the Sea" is not solid. With the help of many friends, they managed to put together the money to realize this performance. Hopefully, they will succeed and open up a new field for the barren land of art in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai's music scene is as desolate as the drama scene. It's really difficult to listen to a weighty piece of music to wash away the psychological fatigue of the week. But Shanghai Radio (900KC) has a classical music program every Sunday morning from 10 to 12, with few commercials and very carefully selected music. They have broadcast Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, Bizet's L'Arlésienne Suite, Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite, and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade Symphonic Suite, all of which are familiar pieces. For music lovers, these two hours are a rare enjoyment. This week</p>
