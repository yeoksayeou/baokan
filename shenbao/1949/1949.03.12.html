<h3>白崇禧等四氏赴杭促駕　何應欽明入京組閣　料立院可順利予以同意</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十一日電〕何應欽已允入京組閣，此係白崇禧·張治中·顧祝同·吳忠信四氏代表李代總統今日來杭促駕之結果。白等四人定十二日向何氏祝賀六秩大壽後返京覆命，何氏則定十三日晋京，開始進行組閣。今日白·張·顧·吳四人曾與何氏於上下午及晚間懇談三次。衆料此項商談，可能包括新閣陣容問題。據隨白氏同來之韋永成稱：此次立法院投何氏之同意票，預計當在半數以上，故新閣之得順利成立，殆已不成問題，今午本報記者趨訪湯公館時，李代總統之四代表正與何應欠共進午餐，商談閣事，何氏初時表示當前國勢艱危，經濟困難出任閣揆，深恐力不勝任，經白等四氏一再堅勸後，業憶接受組閣大命。其後記者又以此事叩訪於白崇禧將軍渠以滿臉笑容接見，雖未予肯定作答，但觀其欣慰之言態，透露彼等之此行促駕使命，已告滿圓完成而無疑義。下午記者再訪張洽中於省府招待所，先謂「張先生溪口之行辛苦了」。張氏笑答：「不，不。溪口有山有水，不辛苦。」記者叩以張將軍何時返京，渠答謂「明天就回去。」記者乘此又進而詢其：「何先生是否同行？」張氏答謂：「今晚還要商量一下。」經默思少頃，又告記者，曰：「明天可以走。一定，一定。」語畢，即匆匆登車赴湯公館而去。十二日為何氏六秩籌慶，十一日晚由蔣鼎文設宴，在湯公館為其暖壽，並兼為白·張·顧·吳四代表洗塵。餐畢，再談組閣上之細節問題，入夜始散。白崇禧等四人係十一日上午十時廿五分由京飛抵　橋機塲，同行者尙有隨員七人。浙省府主席周　，航空學校校長胡偉克及其他地方官長均曾往迎。張·吳宿省府招待所，顧祝同則與何氏同下榻湯公餲，何夫人移居新新旅館。</p>
<h3>李代總統咨文晨可送達　立院今下午開會　俾行使同意權後何氏迅速組閣</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕授命何應欽將軍組閣事，經白崇禧·顧祝同·張治中·吳忠信等十一日赴杭敦勸商談結果，十一日晚七時許已正式完全同意。此項結果已由白崇禧於八時以長途電話向李代總統報告，白等以促駕使命元成，定十二日自杭返京復命。李代總統甚盼何氏亦同機返京，惟八時白氏與李代總統通長途電話時，何氏尙未決定卽於十二日同返，但此並不影響立院行使同意權之進行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕李代總統決定提名何應欽出任行政院院長，其提名咨請立院同意之咨文，定十二日上午九時送達立法院。十一日晚九時已先以電話通知立法院長童冠賢及秘書長陳克文；童氏當決定於十二日下午三時召開臨時會議，先舉行全院審查會，予以審查後，卽行行使同意權，俾能迅速決定同意與否，以利新閣之組或。開會通知正連夜趕發中。李代總統原定十一日晨九時將咨文送達立院，嗣因十日晚與在杭之何應欽氏通長途電話，以尙有若千細節須待商討，當晚總統府卽通知立院咨文恐不及於十一日晨送出。十一日晨李代總統復邀請白崇禧·張治中·吳忠信。顧祝同等飛杭，與何應欽氏懇談。十一日晚八時白氏等再度由杭來長途電話，報告李代總統謂若干細節已大致解決。李代總統乃於晚九時命通知立院，準備召開臨時會行使同意權。李代總統提名何應欽任行政院長，各方對此一致表示滿意。預料十二日立院會中，必能順利予以同意。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕李代總統十一日晚九時半在官邸召見立法院長童冠賢，就提名何應欽為行政院長立院行使同意權問題，有所商談。</p>
<h3>以午宴方式　徴黨內意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕李代總統定十二日正午在總統府以便餐招待在京之國民黨中央常務委員及中央政治會議委員，就提名何應欽出任行政院長事，徵求各委員之意見，席間並將對未來新閣中之各部會首長及政務委員等人選交換意見。衆信李代總統此舉，係因依照國民黨慣例，提名黨員任行政院長，須經中常會通過，現中常會不及在京召開，故以午宴方式徵求各委員之意見。據悉：在京之中常委，中政委共有廿餘人，于右任，居正，孫科，吳鐵城，劉健羣，吳忠信，張治中，張羣，邵力子，朱家驊，白崇禧，徐永昌，程潛，洪蘭友，李宗黃，范予遂，黃少谷，鄧文儀，王啓江，程思遠，倪文亞，湯如炎，黃宇人等均被邀請。程潛因此改十三日離京返湘，吳鐵城亦展期赴滬。在杭駕促之白崇禧，張治中，顧祝同三氏，可能於十二日午前由杭趕京參加，報告與何應欽洽談經過。</p>
<h3>孫科將休養　暫時擺脫政治</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十一日電〕前行政院院長孫科十一日對合衆社稱：渠將暫時擺脫政治，稍作休養，因渠自一九三九年自歐洲返國以後，迄未休息。但渠稱：渠將繼續參加起草和平計劃之十人委員會的工作，因此項委員會原屬臨時性者，工作完成後，卽將撤銷。渠稱：和平計劃之一般原則業已草成。渠並未說明渠將赴何處休假。</p>
<h3>重慶艦炸沉又一訊　穗報戴另有兩艦同時炸沉　地點在大連旅順之間某地</h3>
<p>〔合衆社廣　　一日電〕據廣州華文報未證個訊：國軍轟炸機不僅已將一重慶號」巡洋艦炸沉，並且已將其他二艦軍艦同時炸沉。該訊稱：轟炸地點在大連港與旅順港之間之某地。據稱：「重慶號」上全體官兵四百五十人皆被炸斃。政府派遺其他兵艦兩艘前往，企圖將「重慶號』截回，但國軍轟炸機將該三兵艦悉予炸沉。當時「重慶號」曾發高射砲回擊，但轟炸機連續反覆轟射二小時，直至所有脫難者悉被擊斃。該訊又稱：除「重慶號」外，在過去一月中，尙有其他軍艦七艘駛赴中共區。</p>
<h3>巴大維與瓊斯　聯袂抵舊金山</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山十日電〕美駐華軍事顧問團長巴大維，駐菲軍事顧問團長瓊斯，十日聯袂返國抵此，巴氏發表在華感想稱：顧問團之職權如不以僅事提供意見及敎導為限，則對中國作戰之貢獻必更大。顧問團之撤退，殊屬可惜。團員在中國人方面結交為友者良多。瓊斯則稱：菲律賓武裝部隊進步極快，並必能再與吾一人駢肩作戰，對付公敵。</p>
<h3>何應欽六秩大壽　杭顯要舉行慶祝</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十一日電〕十二日為何應欽氏六秩壽辰，張强。張道藩。吳望伋·方靑儒·兪濟民·金潤泉定當日上午八時半在湯公館向何氏敬壽麵，並設簡單禮堂，湯恩伯定十二日晨來杭，韋永成·蔣鼎文·兪叔平。陳武民等已來杭。</p>
<h3>郵電鐵路不合理加價　立院請迅予制止　停止徴兵徴糧案付審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕郵·電·鐵路十一日起加價事，十一日晨在立法院中引起激烈之反對，與會各委員咸一致抨擎此舉之不當，當通過迅速通知行政院，予以制止，對十一日起實行之新價，槪不予承認。十一日晨立院係舉行第三會期第四次會議，出席委負一八一人，童冠賢主席，九時半開會，報告事項後，鄒樹文等卽提出緊急動議，請咨請行政院迅速制止交通事業漲價，在鐵路·郵·電按照成本指數調整運價及資費辦法未審定前，不得隨意漲價，今日所公布之價格，應不予承認。當經會衆同意，宣付討論，各委員紛紛發言，咸認郵政法規定郵資加價必須經過立法程序，鐵路加價雖不必經立法程序，但亦當由政院通過，現加價旣不經立院，亦不經政院通過，顯屬違法，應由監察院提出糾正，且公務員收入係照生活指數，鐵路·郵·電不照生活指數，亦不合理，此種自行漲價辦法，顯有破壞金圓券信用之嫌。討論甚久，經主席徵詢會衆全體無異義通過。旋繼續討論議案。</p>
<p>第一案黃統等卅三人提議迅速停止徵兵徵糧案，決議由內政及地方自治委會，國防委會及糧政委會各推委員五人，會同審查，以內政及地方自治委會委員為召集人，其餘委員得自由參加，並於一星期內提出院會報告。</p>
<h3>簡化行政機構案　十五日以前審竣</h3>
<p>第二案陳顧遠等提議為簡化行政機構，首先修正行政院組織法第三條條文案，原提案人陳顧遠說明理由後，各委員咸就提案中所提議之應予保留及應予改併之部會提出意見，包括水利部應縮小為署，隸屬內政部，地政部亦應縮小為署，將來可能改為地政委會，農林部因業務過少，應改部為司，勞工局不必直隸政院，應隸屬內政部，蒙藏僑務兩委會應改為蒙藏司，僑務司，分隸內政，外交兩部，司法行政部業務可由司法院辦理，不必設部。此外，有人認為簡化機構不應僅限行政院，其他各院亦須簡化，華僑立委則反對縮小僑委會，蒙古立委亦反對蒙藏委會改為蒙藏司，至十二時止，尙有數人未及發言，當經決定下午繼續討論，宣告散會。</p>
<p>午後續會，出席一六五人，仍由童冠賢主席，繼續討論簡化行政院機構案，發言者仍對各部會之保留，改併加以論列，有人則主張消極的意義固為簡化，但為表示積極的建設，則應設者亦當加入，故地政仍應為部，另須加設一「國營企業部」，以符民生主義中發展國營企業之旨。某委員以為，歲入歲出均應由財部編製預算，主計部不必改處，乾脆取消。最後決議照程序委會意見，由該院廿一個委員會委員中各推出一人會同審查，法制委會委員為召集人，其餘委負得自由參加，並請於十五日前審查完竣，提院會討論，當塲推定鄉震宇等廿一人負責審查。</p>
<h3>立法委員續有報到</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立委十日報到者有王秉鈞，臧元駿，劉振東，楊不平，劉廣瑛，李芝亭，劉郁中，羅大愚，莫淡雲，冷彭，王力航，黃少谷，吉佑民等十三人。十一日有李慧民，李琢仁，，邢淑孍，劉明侯，王洽民，朱文德，許孝炎，王澤民，姜伯彰，馮具邦，王德溥，楊思誠，劉慕眞，劉贊同，尹述賢等十五人，連前共三六七人。</p>
<p>〔中央社長沙十一日電〕留湘立委李全理，莫淡雲，駱啓蓮，賀醒漢，楊汝梅，史宗周，蔣肇周，蕭連蔚，余佳，趙炳瑢一行十人，十日取道浙贛路赴滬轉京，餘定十五日首途。昨分晤陳濟棠邵力子</p>
<h3>程潛改明日返湘</h3>
<p>昨分晤陳濟棠邵力子</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕長沙綏署主任兼湘主席程潛，原定十一日晨離京返長，臨時決定延至十三日返任。十一日午陳濟棠·郡力子兩氏曾先後訪晤程氏。</p>
<h3>立法院舉行秘密會議　通過和平意見書　提供談判大原則努力促成和平</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立院十一日院會於下午二時十分改開秘密會議，討論和平問題，仍拒記者旁聽。會議由童冠賢主席，秘書處宣讀黃宇人等廿一人整理和平問題意見報告書，繼由黃宇人，樓憂文說明整理經過，並謂：除報告書外，其他各委員對於和平之意見，將由秘書處隨時彙集，送交政府參考，各委員對意見書文字紛紛提出修正意見，最後將全文無異議通過，六時許散會。</p>
<h3>意見書全文</h3>
<p>茲將立院和平意見書整理委員會草擬之和平意見書全文誌次：</p>
<p>和平為我中華民族固有之最高道德，尤為目前舉國一致之迫切要求，兩月以來，政府倡議和平，中共同聲相應，雖見仁見智，容有異同，而救國救民，初無二致。本院同仁來自全國各地，深知人民之願望在求永絕戰禍，安居樂業，獲取基本人權之切實保障，並集中全國力量，改革現狀，建設統一進步之新中國。現正式和談卽將開始，允宜代表民意，以至誠之呼籲，作有效之支持，務期本互讓合作之精神，謀和平建設之實現，　於箕豆相煎之敎訓，根絕內戰相循之危機，本院同仁責任所在，願盡最大努力，以促其成，爰決議如左：</p>
<p>（一）在本院第二會期休會期間，政府關於和平之各項措施，本院表示贊同，並予支持。</p>
<p>（二）關於各項重大問題，應依雙方一向共同主張之政治民主化，經濟社會化，軍隊國家化，黨派合法化等原則，求得合理之解決</p>
<p>（三）關於今後和談進行事宜，應由根據上述人民對和平之願望及前項原則，妥愼處理。</p>
<h3>童院長談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕立法院長童冠賢，十一日就立院通過之和平意見書語本報記者，此項意見，係就和平之大原則而擬定，目的係使國共雙方均能贊同，立院不擬對具體問題加以討論，因和談係政府之職責，立院僅提供原則希望政府能本此原則進行，以後如有意見，仍當隨時提出。</p>
<h3>中共對和談　尙夫積極表示</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京十一日電〕政府今雖在推進早日開始和談之計劃，但據官方宣布，中共尙無準備談判之積極表示。李代總統正趕緊成立新閣，其主要任務卽為與中共談判和平，惟雙方軍隊仍在改編增援，共軍正在修復鐵路，並作大規模渡江準備。政治觀察家多數對和平前途顯示悲觀，認為雙方雖皆願意和平，但其最低限度之和平條件為彼此所不能接受。</p>
<h3>無錫縣參議會　呼籲停戰談和</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫十一日電〕縣參議會十一日大會決定，上電李代總統，毛澤東先生，呼籲和平，請求立卽停戰，遴派大員速開和談，舉凡足以障礙和平之措施，從速掃除，如有裨益和平之貢獻，悉予採納，庶幾化干戈為玉帛，掃戾氣為祥和。</p>
<h3>共國重兵集南通　原駐揚州之第十縱隊亦東開　六圩國軍南撤說不確</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江十一日電〕此間駐軍某部今日否認國軍自六圩橋頭堡南撤之傳說。軍方發言人稱：本軍駐防江北岸施家橋，三汶河，六圩，瓜洲等地之某師，迄仍在原陣地與共軍對峙中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕軍息：原駐揚州之第十縱隊，現起開始向泰縣方面移動，第九縱隊已證實其調來蘇北，該部刻亦在泰縣附近，並與第十縱隊取同一方向向東移動中。據軍方非正式情報：該兩部調動之目的地，似為南通啓東一帶。按除九·十兩縱隊外，蘇北共軍在如皐尙有第十一縱隊，現可能已南調至靖江如皋以南地區，在泰縣及海泰兩側有第十二縱隊，迄本日止，仍在原處，未有他調跡象。在通榆綫上，週前亦由空軍發現有二萬餘八，沿公路向東台方面行動，其後曾否繼續南下，軍方亦尙未接獲正確情報。至南通方面原駐有共軍長江縱隊之一〇四·一〇五·一〇六·三個團，第九軍分區之司令部亦在該地，南通周圍之共軍。據軍方過去之情報，計東如警衛團駐丁堰，通如支隊駐白蒲，南通警衛團駐餘東，海防團駐掘港，東南警衛團駐聚星鎭。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十一日電〕關於共軍第十兵團許世友部調來蘇北之說，此間軍方根據各方面情報判斷，已極近可靠程度，其司令部位置當在淮陰。據南返之國軍被俘軍官稱：渠等在淮安縣街道中，曾見一指示該部聯絡處所在地之路標，上書「第十兵團聯絡處」字樣。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十一日電〕鎭江來電稱：共軍一萬餘名，在重砲掩護下，猛襲江北岸儀徵迤西十哩處之大河口，該處局勢不明，儀徵可聞淸晰之砲聲及機關槍聲。同時，共軍一大隊向南移動，已抵天長，卽可加入儀徵方面之戰事。</p>

<h3>社論　和平，奮鬥。救濟中國！</h3>
<p>——國父逝世二十四週　年紀念感言——</p>
<p>北望碧雲寺，南瞻紫金山，年年今日，大家向國父孫中山先生致祭，追懷往事，每以奉行三民主義相策勉；而國民黨人眞能深切反省，澈底發憤者，究有幾人？今年今日，碧雲寺旣淪於中共軍隊之手，紫金山亦幾在中共砲火威脅之下，，一衣帶水，萬種愁懷！中國國民黨之在今日，自中央幹部，全黨黨員其必抱愧負疚，而自感其無顏以對孫先生在天之靈。雖李代總統孫科院長等要人今天還能登紫金山以謁孫先生之陵寢，瞻念其遺容，吾知其苟有天良，當不勝其可恥而又可痛。至若一般自稱為奉行國父遺敎的國民黨黨員，上焉者但期潔身自好，或孤憤而佯狂，或引恨以終古，或沈淪於下僚，或隱遯於山林，而不肖之徒，則賣官鬻爵，奪利爭權，捭　縱橫，朝秦暮楚，二十年來，民生中義束諸高閣，坐令國父遺敎，未能發揚光大。回顧孫先生逝世以還，國民黨之盛衰，『雖曰天命，豈非人事哉？」</p>
<p>國父深知建國之不易，所以主張革命建國，並為革命奮鬥了四十年，不屈不撓，直到臨終的一剎那，猶以『革命尙未成功，同志仍須努力』，殷殷告誡他的信徒。而尤其可貴的是：他指示出一條革命建國的康莊大道，『和平，奮鬥，救中國！」僅從字面解釋，這句最後的遺言也是非常淺顯的。這七個字的意思就是說，中國所最迫切需要的是和平，但和平不能自天而降，也不是唾手可得，需要渴望和平的國人共同奮鬥：必奮鬥而後和平才能實現，必和平實現而後中國可以得救。在過去的二十四年內，除了抗戰八年為爭國家民族的生存而外，不論在北伐期間，或抗戰勝利以後的三年內戰期間，我們都沒有體味出這句國父遺言的眞義。但在今日的環境之下，看了國父的遺囑，格外覺得國父遺言含義深長，充滿了無限的眞理。可惜我們以前沒有大智大勇，切實去做，到現在如果我們再不急起直追，把握時機，切實去做，則機會之來，稍縱即逝，大好歲月，倘祗蹉跎於意見紛歧，鈎心鬥角之中，不但無以對國父在天之靈，而且將重為國家之罪人！</p>
<p>三民主義在今天依然應該是革命建國的不二法門·今天國家大局之所以糟，國民黨之所以失敗，決非三民主義之咎，而是國民黨人不能眞實努力以推行三民主義之咎。共產黨今天似乎還不敢公然以共產主義相號召，而美其名曰新民主主義，强令華北人民羣相學習，即此可以證明中國還應當是三民主義的世界。在民族方面：我們對外雖也不惜犧牲一切，以求得民族的自由平等，但決不志在侵略，亦無意强他國以從我；對內則主張國內各民族一律平等，大家和平相處，更不願有少數民族的問題發生，以保持國內的永久和平。在民權方面：國父的目的，乃欲使國人在法律上政治上完全平等，並以政權治權之劉分，使政府與人民可以合作無間，運用自如；而中央與地方則更取均權主義，使歷史上合久必分，分久必合的戰亂不致再演於來日。在民生方面：自始主張勞資協調，遂漸消除階級的存在，而平均地權與節制資本，更可使社會經濟獲得長治久安的基礎。所以國父的一部革命理論，完全是以和平為出發點的；他一生從事革命，可以說完全為了中國的和平，同時也可以說為了世界的和平。在全國渴望和平聲中，紀念國父逝世，我們人民，尤其國民黨人，必須乘此深切反省，今後所須努力奮鬥以爭取的和平，應該是無背於孫先生遺敎的和平，應該是建築在決心實行三民主義的基礎土的和平。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者：我們須知為什麽要求和平，為的是要『救中國』。故救中國是目的，而和平乃為其方法。假定大家只知嚷着和平，而不問和平之如何取得，以及取得怎樣內容的和平”換言之，只求和平的形式完成，而是否能引導中國到得救之路則置之不顧，那又豈是孫先生最後遺言之本意？現在，中共區域內天天在那裏强制人民學習新民主主義，研究毛澤東氏的八條和平條件，彷彿這此已是今後的金科玉律，而末聞國民黨人以及孫中山先生三民主義之信徒，還有一些勇氣認為三民主義之澈底實行為和平的第一義諦，誠令人百思而不得其解。</p>
<p>一個政黨也罷，一種政治改革運動也罷，軍事失敗不足憂，政治失敗不足憂，獨有精神失敗是眞足深憂的。國民黨在今天，無論大局之和得成與否，不能不認為已遭到重大的失敗。但這失敗，不會抹煞國民黨已往對民族國家的偉大貢獻，同時也不致斷絕國民黨未來對民族國家有所努力的途徑，只要國民黨人的精神能够不頽喪不失敗。而今天，國民黨之所要戒愼恐懼，力圖補救而銀作者，恰正是在這一點精神上！我們願在國父逝世紀念之日，能見國民黨黨魂之復蘇！</p>

<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十日電〕蘇聯財長柴維里夫今夜在最高蘇維埃聯邦院與民族院聯席會議提出蘇聯歷史上最龐大之預算案，要求在本年度撥付國防經費七百九十億盧布，較去年增加約百分之二十。新預算案規定本年度國庫總收入計四千四百五十二億另八百萬盧布，總支出四千一百五十三億五千五百萬盧布，盈餘三百億盧布，去年度總收入則為四千另八十四億盧布，總支出三千六百八十億盧布，盈餘三百九十六億盧布，目前雖無自由市塲可決定盧布之國際匯率，但依照官價，每一盧布約合美金一角九分。據此，蘇聯本屆軍事預算相當於一百五十億美元。（按美國本年度總預算為四百十八億五千八百萬元，其中一百四十三億元係國防經費）美蘇兩國軍事預算不能作準確比較，因其項目不同，物價上落，且蘇聯對於上述因素缺乏充分報告。柴氏宣稱，國防經費之增加，大部份係因政府取消津貼後批發價格高漲所致，但蘇聯仍將繼續推行世界和平政策。渠並猛烈抨擊美國，指斥目前國際局勢混亂應由美國負責，謂美國本屆軍事預算超過一九三七年十五倍之多，柴氏對於英國增加國防經費亦有疪瘺。</p>

<p>毛澤東之工商政策有十六個字：「發展生產，繁榮經濟，公私兼顧，勞資兩利，」所有工廠均已開工增產，勞資關係在「兩利」原則下合作甚佳，除天津中紡七廠燬於砲火外，各廠均無重大損失，國營事業之「接收」，僅派少數人員監視而已，對民營工廠很少干預。北平「學習」之風甚盛，不論機關，學校，工廠均熱烈展開「學習」，所謂「學習」，意卽學習中共思想與作風，例如：共軍初進城時，北平市府人員，均脫下西裝革履藏匿不穿，葉劍英得悉後，卽召集全部屬員訓話，告以原有洋服，不必擱置不穿，今後能崇尙儉蹼，少用洋貨就是。故其後北平街頭西裝客重又出現。共區幣制，以人民券爲主，各種邊幣將陸續收回，「袁大頭」與「美鈔」彼時仍舊通用，且交易甚盛，大約「大頭」十五枚，可換美鈔元。</p>
<p>技術人員待遇略高</p>
<p>共黨亦認承三民主義，對民生主義尤其强調，作風相當溫和。通航，通郵談判均極圓滿，航機亦在恢復之例，卽中國航空公司，雖有洋股關係，但亦不予例外。工業方面共黨對技術人員待遇略有提高，其他槪與舊制相仿，薪工以小米爲單位云云。張氏報告畢，該會卽討論與華北易貨問題；田和卿·傅良駿·謝天沙·王國賢·潘士浩·葉茀康·郭永熙等均·熱烈發言，大致田·傅·葉等諸人均認爲與華北易貨刻不容緩，否則上海各工廠在原料缺乏，成品呆滯下無法生存，而潘郭等則認爲目前僅加研究，尙談不到易貨，且未徵得杜理事長同意，不宜操切從事，最後決定先由工業會歐陽崙秘書長，將此項情形報告杜理事長，由杜氏與魏文瀚等先行取得聯絡，俾可明瞭華北情形。同時各業準備資料，以待下次會討論。</p>

<h3>中國的麥加　河州巡禮</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州七日航訊〕在積石山的東麓，大夏河的中下游，有一塊邱陵地帶，遠遠望去，山嶺間，谷壑中，平原上，三五里內，便有或大或小的禮拜寺矗立着，這就是中國的麥加——河州。</p>
<p>河州漢稱鳳林驛，唐稱抱罕郡，明稱河州衛，民國以來，先改名導河縣，現名臨夏縣·臨夏這名稱爲時尙短，多有不知道的，但提起甘肅的河州來，都可說是久仰大名了。</p>
<p>回胞信仰中心</p>
<p>河州雖僅是全國兩千餘縣中的一縣，但是這一縣確有與衆不同之處，它不但產生了一位國府委員（馬麟），六位省主席（馬福祥，馬麒，馬福壽，馬鴻賓，馬步芳，馬鴻逵），四位軍長（馬步靑，馬繼援，馬呈祥，馬敦靜），而且還是一個顯著的回民區域，回胞的信仰中心。過去由於交通閉塞，一般人對它都有夾雜着誘惑恐怖的神秘感，視爲特殊區域。過去或者有好事的人故意渲染，以增加地方與中央之距離，而謀求奔走自重的機會，但至今早已走上精誠團結之途，假如還說有什麼特殊的話，那只有一部份人民的宗敎。習俗上與別地方人不同而已。</p>
<p>河州轄有臨夏·永靖·和政·寗定四縣，（現在一般人所說的河州，却狹義的僅指臨夏一縣而言。）全區人口有四十四萬三千餘人，其中回敎人占半數以上，零星的分佈在四縣的每一個角落裏。在臨夏東部，寗定北邊，一個五十公里的山巒區域，有許多人散居在窰洞裏，過着穴居農耕的簡單生活，他們的性情剛毅，生活艱苦，虔誠的信仰着回敎，但他們却是蒙古人的血統。據考證：元朝蒙古皇族有一支皈依了回敎，因被放逐，一直流亡到地瘠人稀的河州東鄉，方才住定。經過五六百年的繁衍，現在約近十萬人。這一帶的地名，多用蒙音，蒙古文字已完全丟淨了，蒙語則仍有不拔的勢力，其中有許多人只知蒙語，不諳他語，婦女尤甚。研究蒙語的學者，如能來這裏作一普通蒙語與此地蒙語的比較研究，必能發現很多有價値的資料。</p>
<p>禮拜寺數千座</p>
<p>在河州這個小小的區域裏，宗敎的尊敬與神聖，使敎外人大感驚訝。河州廿多萬回敎同胞，不管生活的艱困，環境的窮迫，都很熱烈地虔誠地去擁護宗敎，做忠實的信徒。在河州區域內，三里五里間，只要有回胞居住的地位，就有禮拜寺存在，其數在幾千座之譜。他們不惜鉅資寗使目已住着漏雨迎風的破屋，或暗無天日的窰洞，却集合羣力，把禮拜寺建築得雄奇壯觀，雕樑畫楝，富麗堂皇，一如古代的宮殿。禮拜寺是回敎的中心，在大些的禮拜寺中，都設有經文大學，有幾十個大學生在鑽研宗敎哲理，每年從本省各地及滇，黔，京，滬等地前來攻讀經文的大學生，絡繹不絕，河州在中國回敎學術上的地位，由此可以想見。</p>
<p>阿衡及其敎徒</p>
<p>阿衡是回敎的權威，在每一個禮拜寺中，都有一位阿衡主持着，他們掌管敎儀，敎律，闡揚敎義，敎育學生，並領導着回民社會。每個回敎徒對他們的阿衡，都極其尊從。　這數十萬忠實的敎徒，每天在晨，晌，晡，昏，宵五次，向他們的眞主禮拜。祈禱，每當禮拜的時辰，走路的停下步子，耕作的放下鋤犂，到禮拜寺去，或順便在田野裏，面朝着西方，按着敎儀作禮拜，那種虔誠的舉動，使人不禁聯想起米勒的「晚禱」名畫來。</p>
<p>每年到閉齋的一月，他們把整個的時間，都消費上在宗敎功課。經商的停止營業，種田的收拾起農具——除了軍公敎人員不得自由外，其餘的都專心寺齋，並去做禮拜，所以在這個月裏，宗敎的氣氛尤其濃厚。他們從黎明到日落，不飲不食，甚至一口唾液也不嚥下去。</p>
<p>一年中間，回敎只有兩個盛大的節日，一個是「開齋節」，一個是「宰牲節」。</p>
<p>熱鬧的開齋節</p>
<p>每逢「開齋節」時，家家戶戶都預備了油香，肉食，相互慶祝，熱鬧異常。開齋節第一天，各家破曉卽起，沐浴酒掃衣冠整齊。成年男子頭纏白巾，集中到禮拜地點去，女人們則在家料理一切。平日分散在四方的人，這時都有聚首的機會，在阿衡的領導下，在廣塲中作大規模的禮拜。雖有成千成萬的人，並未受過軍事訓練，然而動作整齊嚴肅，甚爲壯觀，長幼有序，不稍紊亂。三天過後，他們又恢復到平時的生活，辛動的工作了了。</p>
<p>宰牲的習俗</p>
<p>「開齋節」後七十天，又欣然迎接「宰牲節」。這一天各家都要宰牲，富人每家宰羊一隻，也有七家合宰一隻牛或是一隻駱駝的，貧寒人家，至少也要宰一隻鷄·依照習俗，要把宰牲的肉分三分之二餽贈親友中的貧窮人家。所以在這個節日裏，幾乎是萬衆騰歡——這也是回敎仁愛的意思。——吃剩的骨頭，必定愼重的埋在地下，不許有一根爲狗獲得。</p>
<p>回胞的婦女們出門，都要以風帽遮髮，靑年戴綠色，中年戴黑色，老年戴白色，她們的衣服大都用紅·綠·紫·等鮮艷的顏色，在這一片土黃的西北背景裏，看來頗覺醒目。</p>
<p>癿藏馬家花園</p>
<p>臨夏西北六十里的軋藏，是前靑海主席馬勳臣的私邸，雖在嚴冬，依然可以看出春夏間的癿藏，風景一定很秀麗，癿藏山頭的馬家花園，有名貴的牡丹千餘株。馬氏私邸前，有他捐資獨修的大禮拜寺一座。韓家集在臨夏西南五十里，是　夏馬鴻逵主席的故居，花園格局也不小，只是略見荒蕪，想是主人多年在外，無暇顧及的綠故。馬鴻逵爲紀念其先翁馬雲亭先生而創辦的私立雲亭學校，在臨夏是最有生氣的學校。</p>
<p>臨夏城的內外</p>
<p>大夏河繞臨夏城東南流過去，近郊四面環山，西南山勢尤爲險峻。城是長方形，北面無城門，南門外有關名叫「八方」，回民商店集中在這一帶。八方之西爲回民住宅區，城北有明王竑墓及昭忠祠，東門外爲大敎塲。西門外一里許就是山，山頭有萬壽觀，山頂聳立一塔，爲臨夏風景生色不少。此外還有花寺，碧家塲，大供北，白莊，大灣頭，沙溝，虎門等八大供北（卽回敎大賢哲的陵地），也建築得美輪美奐，十分壯觀。</p>
<p>虔信唯一眞主</p>
<p>臨夏的農產豐富，菓木，花卉和菜蔬，都很茂盛·在商業上；是與拉卜楞一帶藏民交易的市塲，日用品大都仰仗於蘭州的輸入。</p>
<p>山川英秀之氣，產生了很多的大阿衡，大學者，和政治家，軍事家，一般的人民，在生活的鞭策下，一代代過着抑鬱而沉默的日子，沒有休息，也沒有埋怨，他們至誠的相信，宇宙間確有一個唯一的眞神—造物者，更相信只有敬信這唯一的眞主，才能從土地上獲得幸福與安樂。</p>

<h3>金銀平準委員決議　加速組設金銀市塲</h3>
<p>徐堪抵滬研討抑平物價方法</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部長徐堪，於昨晨自京來滬，當卽赴中行二樓參加金銀平準委員會每晨九時舉行之例會。</p>
<p>聞徐財長以財金新方案公布後，物價波動並未稍戢，當同與會之人氏，包括劉攻芸·席德懋·李道南·林崇墉·等從詳商討，研究如何機動應付之方。</p>
<p>會中以金銀開放後，其價格之波動，顯然已成一般物價漲落之指標，故尤傾全力以研討。最後決定，仍爲加速促成本市金銀公開市塲之組設，俾使金銀市况，能透過正式之公開市塲，復由官方嚴密之監督下，納於正軌、</p>
<p>據與會之某要員語記者：金銀公開市塲，經昨日會中商談後，已獲進一步之端倪。官方且已正式指示與未來金銀市塲有關之各方面，努力從速籌備，遲至下週內，可望正式成立。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者以金銀公開市塲成立之訊，甚囂塵上，昨特向本市金業領袖徐輔蓀探詢籌備情形，據徐氏告稱；該業迄未接到主管機關任何有關復業之指示，故一切仍陷停頓狀態中。該業今後卽有所準備，亦必須根據官方命令爲依歸，故下週一立卽復業之說，當屬不可能。又該業原有市塲，久已散租予人，卽使立時收回，裝修亦須經年累月，方堪供用，故萬一官方急須金業市塲復業，則可能借用其他市塲交易。</p>
<h3>銀根緊後見馳　暗息退入百元關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根，呈初緊後鬆之態勢，初開順隔日緊勢，日拆每千元開一百元，至一百二十元。後市塲風傳台灣匯款卅五億元，已有局部流出，一說達十億元之譜，銀根緊勢稍弛，日拆亦盤低至八十五元九十元有供。　中午十二時半後，銀根已見鬆動，日拆亦遂步退至八十元關內，嗣後更退至六七十元有供。最後銀根雖有紗布結款廿餘億元，惟未如預期之緊俏，一因外埠匯款流出，二因國庫有款額支出，故昨日行局仍差出一〇九二一三萬元，大交換各行則差八九九一六〇萬元，洋商各行差出九九四七五萬元，小交換各行差入一〇九五二八萬元。</p>
<p>又今日有紗布及食糖結款亦達廿億元之譜，惟聞當局仍將有相當之匯款頭寸流出，故銀根鬆緊有相互抵銷之趨勢，日拆恐將盤檔於七八十元間。</p>
<p>退票增多</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕日前銀根奇緊後，票據交換時行莊缺單奇多，結果退票亦超過空前之數額，計退票張數達四三四二張，金額達廿二億七千七百萬元。昨日情形雖較好轉，惟數額仍相當龐大。現開本市金管當局，對此已密切注視，將加緊對行莊之抽查工作，以明退票責任誰屬。</p>
<p>成立公約</p>
<p>又銀行公會方面，除已通函各會員切實遵守票據交換時間外，並聞各交換行莊約有八十餘家之譜，業於最近成立退票公約。根據該公約，如在交換時間以前，有退票情事者，應先以電話通知退票行莊，以便該行莊另行準備抵補之頭寸，而免臨時缺單云。飾金掛三十萬七千元</p>
<h3>金市初疲後堅　節金掛三十萬七千元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日金市初以卅萬〇五至卅一萬高盤開出，旋聞國行仍照隔日老價廿九萬配售銀樓業，故價亦逐步盤小至廿八萬八千至廿九萬元，最低廿七萬元有成交。</p>
<p>午刻因受銀根轉鬆影響，價回升至廿九萬六至廿九萬八千元。下午三時一刻光景，最高行市叩卅三萬七至卅四萬元，終以卅二萬七至卅三萬收市。</p>
<p>又國行昨照舊價廿九萬元，配售銀樓業黃金約八百兩。各銀樓門市掛牌未動，條塊仍爲廿九萬五千八百元，手飾金爲卅萬〇七千元。營業以金市又盤高，較日前已見熟烈。據某大銀樓中人稱：一種成交約在二十兩之譜。</p>
<p>美鈔</p>
<p>走勢隨金價之上落，前市趨勢亦疲，後市帶息明升暗平，前市收盤爲五八三〇元，五八八〇元，後市收盤爲六五五〇元，六六〇〇元。</p>
<h3>加鑄銀元</h3>
<p>每日增產至十五萬枚</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央造幣廠某負責人昨語記者，該廠自開鑄銀幣迄今，先後已鑄成廿六萬枚，其中十五萬枚業已移送國行發行局，靜候需要時發行。</p>
<p>該廠自今日起，鼓銷銀元之機器，將增爲四架，而銀元之產量，亦將自每日之六萬枚增加至十二萬枚，十五日以後，每日之產量將增至十五萬枚云。</p>
<h3>千元大鈔</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨市上盛傳國行新版千元券，已開始在市上出籠。茲據該行某發言人語記者，新版千元券，早經公告發行在案，惟迄目前爲止，均係運赴外埠急需大宗現鈔之地發行，本市方面，迄未發行。將來當視實際需要，再斟酌發出云</p>
<h3>開盤市況平庸　華股臨收好轉</h3>
<p>華股市况，因受行局連續差進影響，昨日市上銀根劇緊，暗息突高至一元，一元二角間，高利壓迫之下，殊使多頭不勝重負，浮散戶尤望而生畏，故塲內人心奇虛。市勢初甚平庸，繼聞台灣匯款四十億，一部份可能於正午發放，銀根有鬆弛之訊，於是人心略見好轉，市勢中途盤升。</p>
<p>永紗晨初在銀根緊俏聲中，及隔昨低盤收市之狀態下，晨開時疲勢依然不脫，先以四元九角半平盤開出後，隔夜空起補納，市勢略好，升五元〇二五元〇五，高後證券帮一致吐售，卽挫至四元八八，九角一，嗣後圈外黃金走勢微堅，銀根趨鬆，暗息回低，市勢一路盤升，最高見五元一角二，五元一角五，高後多頭紛了，一度疲軟，低盤於五元〇七，五元一角，最後續見盤小，終以五元〇五分收盤。</p>
<p>中小型股晨開時，隨永紗之趨勢，各股先後均以平盤開出，惟因銀根大勢緊急，暗息高昂，多頭頗感乏味，空方亦因塲上謠諑紛紜，傳說不一，隔夜風險過大，故動靜亦呆，美亞新光供求尙平，市况尙堅。信和景福交易沉寂，市勢仍軟，新華百貨因有拉提，走勢獨俏，以一元三角三分漲登限度，其餘雜牌股均多頹唐。</p>
<p>外股上揚</p>
<p>昨日外股市况，因圈中銀根先緊後弛，各檔初開皆見小面，後因台灣匯款放寬，銀根亦稍趨鬆動，人心活躍，故收盤皆告上揚。</p>
<p>怡紗做一〇七〇〇元，較上日升起一千餘元，鍋業公司做二三〇〇元二四〇〇元，較上日軋升四百餘元。亞洲航業昨日初露秀勢，做一〇四〇元，一〇六〇元，會德豐再見新高峯，高做三二〇〇〇元，三五〇〇〇元，校上日有升起五千元之譜，其他各股亦皆告堅挺。</p>
<h3>港匯大縮</h3>
<p>港匯昨日市勢再度狂縮，申電匯每千元昨日晨開七角二分，前日收盤七角九分。　金圓每千元晨開一元一角，前日收一元一角七分五厘。</p>
<p>港金每港兩三〇五元五角，前日收同價。美金電匯五元二角二分，前日收同價。美金期票五元二角，前日收五元一角九分·美鈔五元一角九分，前日收五元一角八分。</p>
<h3>柴油到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴拿馬輪中國油船號，昨自波斯頓到滬，運來柴油一萬七千餘噸（散艙），現泊卅一·卅二號游浮筒起卸，該油爲電力公司所購。又招商局海列輪，由喀爾各答運來煤斤六千八百八十噸，預計下星期六（十九日）到埠。</p>
<h3>市塲散步　看客</h3>
<p>有秩序上漲是政策嗎？　今後的金價米價將要如何漲法？</p>
<p>大家說：當局現在推行的財金政策，從配金掛牌價方面，從提高利息方面，表現出來的，是高物價政策。不過不是讓牠濫漲，而是要牠有秩序的漲。</p>
<p>是的，有秩序確比無秩序，像點髖統。</p>
<p>那末，姑不問當局能否在市塲中建立控制力量？假定確能把無政府狀態的市塲，納入有秩序的軌道。那末我們來算算看，今後物價作有秩序的上漲，便將漲成什麼局面呢？</p>
<p>這種計算是很容易的，因爲是有秩序的原故。譬如現在的銀錢業日拆五角，卽每千元五十元，那末一個月單利一千五百元卽一倍半，複利連本至少每月四倍以上。假定按每半個月加一倍計算，便可假定今後各月物價增漲的趨勢了。</p>
<p>爲簡單起見，我們姑按生活費指數及金價米價爲例，照每半月加一倍推算，到今年中秋節，便成下面那副樣子了。</p>
<p>這就是有秩序的上漲，有秩序的上漲，也就是這樣。</p>
<p>試看現時的金價，確已卅萬多，米價也是三萬多，恰好等於上月底的生活費指數加了一倍。所以本月中的指數，至少不應在一千二百八十六倍之下。不過應不應是一件事，是不是又是一件事。我們關心的是物價，由金米類推，那末這個樣子的財金改策，何能獲致民心呢？</p>
<h3>食米平定　麵粉欲振無力　油市初平後挺</h3>
<p>米市昨市平定，貨主雖欲喊高，但因銀根奇緊，欲漲乏力，南市塲開市小五百，中市米店納取轉挺，白粳漲三百，薄稻漲五百，北市塲白粳及早薄稻各站原價，特粳三萬二千元，到貨南北二市共計五四三四石。</p>

<p>麵粉　市勢，先跌後升，以銀根甚緊，進戶甚稀，初開兵船粉一萬二元，低三百元，旋以開價過低，散戶逢低補進，價乃上揚，臨收因銀根緊勢稍减，價驟漲三百元，收市爲一萬二千五百八十元，老車收市一萬三千〇五十元，漲二百元，麩皮漲三百五十元。</p>
<p>雜糧　多見上揚，因到源稀少，貨主扳持甚力，獨黃豆以油餅轉疲，後市亦見回挫，漢口車豆跌進二萬七千關，乍豆喊二萬四千元，生仁徽秀五千元，苞米靑帮力吸，激升千餘元，紅糧跟挺，揀靑漲二千。</p>

<p>桐油下游　桐油昨市，晨初卽因外匯移轉證軟，趨勢隨之轉虛，俄傾更以銀根仍趨緊俏，聞市塲拆息高，一般同業大都不勝重息負荷，頻有前來吐售，底盤竟呈不支，急遽下游，迨後頭寸雖告微鬆，但市氣尙未抬頭，臨收結果，靑油猛降二萬元，足度白油亦跌五千元，至於正副各脾西洪，在到源窒滯中，跌勢較緩，計小二千元左右。</p>
<h3>茶市穩定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據茶業權威人士告記者：自頭寸緊箍兩日後，壓力雖亦彼及茶葉同業，但因茶存枯澀，兼以鐵路運費陡增二倍左右，影響成本不已，故執貨者心思續圖掙扎，是以趨勢一度在喘息中，又形鎭定。價格方面，仍再掛紅，惟買戶感於旣難隨心所欲，同時暗息高昻，致一時不敢下手，態度猶豫，交易遂猶不多。</p>
<h3>絲綢前疲後升</h3>
<p>人絲昨日因市上銀根突緊，業內週轉較難，暗息升高至一元以上，執戶脫意轉伸展，市勢平疲。</p>
<p>一二〇號東洋晨開一四〇萬，開後抬面吐售不絕，價見回軟，低喊一三八萬，低後納胃甚滯，人心頗虛，市勢在低檔盤旋，嗣後因市上銀根略鬆，納胃微起午收當日頭寸仍以一四〇萬收盤，隔日頭寸做一六〇萬收市，午後銀根略鬆，黃金報升，人心大好，喊價續升。</p>
<p>生絲以外匯證晨開時走勢極挺，人心尙俏，惟因銀根奇緊，執戶負息太重，脫意尙濃，優級初做二一〇萬，徘徊不已，近午聞台灣匯款部份開放，銀根轉鬆，市息低落，執戶反吐爲進，市勢卽高，最後喊二一六萬，午後趨勢平穩，喊價因黃金略升，人心稍定，喊價續俏，惟無正式成交</p>
<p>綢緞先因銀根緊急，各方納胃不暢，市勢疲軟，美亞晨開爲九二五〇〇〇元，一度低落一萬元，近午聞華股好轉，銀根趨鬆，人心轉好，一度高至九八五〇〇〇元，終以九七五〇〇〇元收盤</p>
<h3>工業會請准　廢蠶絲進口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據市工業會技委會息：廢蠶絲係國產絹絲品之主要原料，戰前國內每年產量可達十餘萬担，勝利後年產驟减至三一萬餘担，而外商猶將此項廢蠶絲競購出口，以致絹絲工業之原料供需相差過鉅，影響生產至深。現已由工業會分函行政院。工商部·及輸管會等機構，呈請准許此項廢蠶絲進口，並將國內此項原料嚴禁出口，以利生產云。</p>
<h3>棉紗近收回升　布市趨勢盤旋</h3>
<p>棉紗始平終俏，初開因銀根普告緊俏，各方見情均無買意，嗣後銀根走勢轉鬆，散戶及同業趁低吸收，價乃節節挺升，迄收浮多略有脫手，最後稍見回小。</p>
<p>四二支藍鳳由二百〇六萬元步昻至二百三十三萬元爲最高，收市爲二百二十九萬元，軋升二十三萬元。四〇支藍鳳亦好起二十二萬元，三二支銀月自一百三十七萬元喊俏至一百五十一萬元結束，終挺十四萬元。</p>
<p>二一支雙馬現貨晨開一百〇八萬元，收市一百十五萬元，較前漲十二萬五千元，廠單最後做一百十四萬五千元。二〇支雙馬重破大關，至一百〇八萬元收市。餘如天女及金城等，皆在一百〇五萬元至一百十萬元問成交，一六支光明亦接近一百萬元，其他各紗俱告帶俏。</p>
<p>棉布晨初因銀根緊勢有增無减，同業需單者甚衆，台灣與廣東諸帮亦迫於頭寸，均以脫貨求現爲原則，迨至收市，因受棉紗騰升之故，市始轉露秀色。</p>
<p>開市龍頭細布三萬九千元，四君子元嗶嘰三萬七千五百元，中途盤旋甚久，終以銀根略感鬆象，空方倉皇抵補，價乃微步同俏，收市前者爲四萬一千五百元，軋漲八百元，後者四萬〇五百元，亦挺八百元。喇叭童及銀月細布反告疲乏，四君子元直貢最後站於四萬元大關，終升五百元，色布與花布府綢等，廠方大多仍以隔日之原盤開出，但成交寥寥，午後塲外買氣轉旺，聞龍頭喊高至四萬六千五百元，嗶嘰四萬五千元。</p>

<h3>今晚籃球聯賽　華聯重逢海青　女子組星華戰力隊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽，今晚甲一組主力戰爲華聯對海靑，華聯第一循環中曾獲大勝，今次二度重逢，勝利當無疑問。華聯上週雖出一冷門，一分敗於培斐爾，全爲體力疲憊之意外事變。海靑近日戰績進步，三個黑人選手尤稱兇猛，可能予華聯以威脅，但美軍欲搖撼華聯，恐無此易事。賽前女子組一塲，星華對力隊，亦爲第二循環賽。比賽五時半開始，體育館門券價目照舊。秩序如下：</p>
<p>星華—力隊（女子組）　五時卅分　裁判　聞宗元　俞菊廬</p>
<p>郵電—合衆（甲二B）　六時一刻　裁判　王亦樵　王立鐸</p>
<p>華聯—海靑（甲一組）　七時一刻　裁判　金伯陶　蔣吟僧</p>
<p>女組唱開羅，星華再戰力隊，前者麾下擁有王慧玲，王姗，朱家珍等名將，惟王慧玲因事在第一循環中未免出塲，實力不無影響，所幸該隊人才衆多，王朱之外，若錢夢月姚思源及新人徐秀雲汪澤倫都係個中好手，在女組中頗具希望。首循三次出馬，兩勝一敗，原亦不弱，但自棄權於綠隊後，名次遂落黎隊之後。力隊經驗不足，鬥力較差，致屢戰屢敗，惟該隊精神至佳，不屈不餒，首循以十七比四二遭星華毒手，此番重逢，含仇雖未必能伸，但以全力週旋到底，未嘗不可予星華以相當威脅。</p>
<p>繼之爲甲二B組郵電對合衆，郵電係梁溪冠軍隊，此次參加聯賽，具有雄心，不幸初戰警機，以塲地燈光不熟，乃告敗績，今日再度出馬，當有優異演出。合衆雖非烏合，但在該組兩戰兩北，戰績平庸，惟迭遭挫折，亦謀振作圖强，屆時兩路哀軍相逢，均擬一逞，戰來之緊張劇烈自在意中。</p>
<p>壓軸甲一組華聯再遇番軍海靑，按兩隊初循相逢，華聯以六三對四七大勝，海靑先後八戰六負二勝，僅勝麥令斯一籌，惟　隊頗具潛力，如魯濱遜派克斯等三個黑人，均頗善戰，潘諾克勃倫霍亦見剽悍，徒以種族之見甚深，黑炭被歧視，內部團結不堅，屢爲他隊所乘，苟能同心協力，實對付非易，華聯海壖盟主，咸力之强無待贅述，本屆第一循環中七戰七勝所向披靡，惟上週末二循初戰，重逢培斐爾，竟冷門獨出，以一分之差慘遭滑鐵盧，今日再度對海靑，前車覆轍，殷鑒未遠，自將審愼從事，而予敵以痛擊也。六路人馬名單錄後：</p>
<p>（星華）王慧玲，王姍，朱家珍，朱蘭貞，吳兆瑞，黃如玉，簡志光，注澤倫，錢夢月，王文璉，姚思源，徐秀雲。</p>
<p>（力隊）翁霞雲，王嘉華，梁妙靈，姚文達，梁妙珍，范玉英，陳善寳，劉澹哉，張善福，周猶男。</p>
<p>（郵電）王春元，余堯，李方贗，呂淸寳，吳錦文，唐民生，高保生，戴耀章。</p>
<p>（合衆）態元忠，李嘉植，蔣思寳，李振邦，李培棟，張有瑋，董紹唐，華敬事。</p>
<p>（華聯）任相成，李震中，吳成章，樂嘉洲，傅金聲，包松圓，劉福善，李漢亭，張良雄。</p>

<h3>丹麥產網球慧星　曾連敗歐美各地名手</h3>
<p>〔美聯社哥本哈根訊〕歐洲網一球界最近突產生了一個善殺鉅人一的靑年，他是一個十八歲的丹麥一學生，名喚哥脫尼爾生，他在這個冬季裏，曾速敗美國一流名將派克，勃琪貝蒂，匈牙利之阿司波夫，瑞典之約翰生，捷克之孫匿克，查匈牙利之阿司彼夫，一九一八年在溫勃爾登單打錦標賽中，賽達最後四人之列，在歐洲網球界裏，是高高的第二名好漢，第一名是捷克之杜洛勃尼，約翰生是瑞典第二名好漢，孫匿克也是捷克第二名好漢。</p>
<p>他因了這種奇蹟，已獲得斯堪的尼維亞（北歐大半島包括挪威瑞典兩國）的戶內網球單打冠軍街，他現下擬借此作跳板，再向西方求深造，並決向溫勃爾登及林山一顯身手。</p>
<p>他進入網球界的事實，奋得連空中樓閣的小說家也未必描寫得出，他是個面如冠玉的高個子，是生就的打球奇才，他的父親是哥本哈根的商人，也曾責過足球，哥脫秉有父質，幼年已成爲丹麥乙組足球隊的明星，但他的性情，對愛好網球，比足球還大點，他六年前，在他的士庫尋獲了一個舊網球拍，便用一條繩，一邊轉在一株樹桿，一淡縛着一桿電燈柱，便開始練習打網球，在獲得丹麥綱球單打冠軍後，去年他曾在歐洲小試身手，竟成功了被選作丹麥的台盃第一單打代表，丹麥之在台盃襄能打入歐洲區的第三週，未嘗不予人以小小的驚異，但後來參加溫勃爾登錦標賽，因未有大塲經驗而怯塲，卒敗於英國的莫托林手下，遂未受人注意，他的第一奇蹟是創於一九四八年，那時他居然打垮了美國的單打冠軍派克，便是他扶搖直上的第一個階段。</p>
<p>到今年十一月，哥脫尼爾生纔達十九齡，他現在的希望，是能往美國加洲大學肄業去，因他以爲加洲才有眞的練就好網球的機會，他也性耽哲學和爵士音樂，他每次出外賽網球，除獎品外，也必帶同許多留聲歌片回國，故美國確是他應去的最理想之處。</p>

<h3>奧林匹克婦狀元（二）　荷蘭飛將軍柯恩夫人傳</h3>
<p>— 定鑫譯</p>
<p>英國的報紙都說她年齡大了，決不能獲得女子八十米跳欄的冠軍，結果她壓倒了這位十九歲的英國女郎茄特那。（圖中她左面的一位）</p>
<p>談起范妮，兩老總搶着數說她音年時代的頑皮。「就是因爲長着兩條跑得快些的腿，范妮整天在跟左鄰右里開玩笑。專好偷摘人家蘋果和亂撳人家的電鈴。整天聽見鄰舍們在喊:「別以妳逃得快，要是被我捉住了，不扭斷妳頸骨，哼！」別瞧范妮現在雖然長大了，哼，她現在還不時偷撳門鈴，和別人開玩笑呢！江山易改，本性難移吧！」</p>
<p>范妮·柯恩第一次在跑道上正式露面是一九三五年八月，初次參加女子二百米賽，非但毫無成就，還幾乎跌了一交。但一個月後卽以驚人姿態在八百米賽中超越過當時荷蘭女長跑冠軍卡蘭娜絲。那時詹恩是卡蘭娜絲的敎練，同時也是差不多已經公認了的荷世運團總導。賽後詹恩說：「賽時我還在替卡蘭娜絲打氣，而且我深信卡蘭娜絲一定會贏，因爲范妮的特長是跳高。當時她跑起來姿勢實在難看，起首六百碼她的脚像是在地上拖，但誰又料得到最後關頭卡蘭娜絲氣力不加的時候，柯恩竟會像箭樣自後竄出。我當時就斷定她短跑方面，一定可以造就。」</p>
<p>此後不久，由於詹恩的賞識，范妮被選入了世運代表團。因爲短跑需要至少一年以上的訓練，詹恩勸她暫時先捨徑就田。但柏林之行仍然相當失敗。范妮僅跳到五呎一吋，和澳洲的卡德，美國的羅吉絲並列第六。她本人成績還不及平時練習。</p>
<p>回到荷蘭後，詹恩就專心致力於教練這個年僅十七的金髮小姑娘。詹恩叫她改習短跑，就在他的朝夕薰陶下，范妮作了一個一百八十度的轉變；從一個蹣跚遲鈍的「鄉下妹」——那時城裏時麾的運動小姐們都這樣喊她——，一變而爲彈力足，衝力强的流綫型急先鋒。一年之內，她包辦了所有荷蘭運動會的短跑項目；還在德國拿到了兩次錦標。</p>
<p>一九三八年在維也納舉行的全歐運動會中，范妮以十二秒正跑畢百米，名列第三。成績已經很不錯了，但雄心勃勃的敎練還不以爲足。</p>
<p>此後詹恩致力於使范妮成爲一全能運動員，除了短跑和跳高外，還要練習跳遠。一九四〇年，更進一步，要范妮邊跑邊跳，——跨欄。</p>
<p>這時蘊藏在他師生倆心裏的熱情，終於鎔化了他們表面上的荷蘭式的冷漠，開始作進一步的交遊。談話範圍也不再限於討論手臂移動的正確姿勢和衝刺等的身體重心等等了。</p>
<p>一九四〇年八月，瓜香蒂熟，范妮·柯恩小姐正名爲詹恩白蘭克斯夫人。</p>
<p>納粹的侵略使詹恩加入軍隊。但不久又回到荷京，就任警察體育指導。除了指導警察們在田·徑上爭雄，詹恩還把日本式的防身術柔道傳授給他們。可憐的范妮就常常因爲詹恩目己要練習柔術招式，半夜裏常給他像抓小鷄般抓起來，扔皮球般扔來扔去。（未完）</p>

<h3>聽崑崙晚會</h3>
<p>— 王冊</p>
<p>六日晚七時至九時半許，崑崙影片公司一部份主要演員如藍馬，黃晨，吳茵，黃宗英，上官雲珠等諸人，假中華自由電台，舉行了第二次崑崙晚會。在這個晚會裏，使銀幕上以及舞台上的影人與劇人，與觀衆中間的距離拉得更近一些，說句「萬家燈火」中的台詞，是影人與觀衆更能够「靠得攏一些」。所以，我在收音機旁飽聆精彩節目之餘，也想隨便寫出點自己的意見。</p>
<p>第一，這個廣播晚會，顯然是爲崑崙新片—沈浮繼「萬家燈火」以後的新作—「希望在人間」開路的。換句話說，崑崙想假着這個晚會，能够爲「希望在人間」多做一點宣傳工作，用意雖好，但在整個節目份量上，這次介紹「希望在人間」所佔的時間，實在太長。比如吳茵的介紹故事，不妨只扼要地說出故事的主題，强調全片最突出的部份。在聽衆說，也容易接受，且所佔的時間也可以縮短多了。</p>
<p>第二，介紹演員及担任播音的名單，凡聽衆不很熟悉的人，不妨把名字的寫法特別介紹給聽衆，這樣，除了，幾個熟悉的明星以外，使崑崙的新人也能够更接近聽衆。</p>
<p>全部節目可以說是相當精彩的。</p>
<p>上官雲珠的「影劇人語』，够得上「意識正確」。她說她過去也做過漂亮的明星夢，現在這個夢已經覺醒了。她說，她勝利以後，雖然拍了七八部片子，可是自己的胆子愈來愈小。並說，朋友們的奮鬥精神，給她很大的感動，今後她拍片子，一定將注意如何去選擇劇本。</p>
<p>一般做明星夢的，倒很可以聽聽這個「自白」。</p>
<p>「朗誦詩」是由藍馬担任的，題目是「奴才讀」，是刋在某報文藝版上的一首小詩。</p>
<p>黃晨答覆了『影劇問答」·吳茵介紹了新片『希望在人間」詳細的故事。</p>
<p>「希望在人間」的演員，也卽是「萬家燈火」的全部演員，不過他們都改變了作風，扮演了完全相反的人物。</p>
<p>獨幕劇一共有三個：「賣火柴的女兒』，『有事化無」，和「求仙記」，都是對現實社會的冷雋的刻劃。</p>
<p>本月二十日下午七時，在原來電台，他們將舉行第三次的晚會，希望他們能有更精彩的節目帶給聽衆。在此無綫電中都是一片低級的靡靡之音和滑頭叫賣的時候，要收聽一些値得聽的的東西，實在已是很不容易的事了。</p>
<h3>魚</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>我的住所位於浦江水濱，憑窗遠眺，可以看見不少的漁船飄蕩在水上。因爲接觸多了，也就不免對魚的事情發生了興趣。</p>
<p>「魚是沒有國家性的，倘若我們不捕，它們就游到其他國家的漁網中去了」。這是我國開始注重「漁」的一個原因。</p>
<p>漁管處剛從美方接手時，曾經有一個笑話：</p>
<p>是黃魚應該上市的時候，船長們奉令率領漁船出海捕魚，可是結果沒有找到黃魚的蹤跡，各船長祗好空手繳差。這一來可惹惱了處長，命令再作第二次的出發，並且說：「黃魚一定有，一定在海中」。於是，漁船又在海中搜索了，可是茫茫大海，叫他們那裏去找呢？結果大多的漁船仍舊一無所獲，只有一艘網到了少許。正在這個時候，一艘從靑島公差歸來的漁船，在歸途中無意地遇到了黃魚羣，可惜限於漁網，除了盡力網捕外，只好限看它們北去。</p>
<p>於是，眞相明白了：這實在是因爲國人甫行接手，不熟悉漁塲所在的綠故。</p>
<p>海洋如此廣闊，如果不淸楚各種魚類的棲止習性，簡直是無從下手的。</p>
<p>像小黃魚並不是大黃魚的兒子，它們的習性喜歡到舟山羣島去，所以那邊成爲一個很好的漁塲；又像鰣魚雖在海水中發育，但長大後特別歡喜到長江來，沿上海，鎭江，漢口以至宜禺等地，就在那裏結婚後下卵，所以捕鰣魚一定要到長江來。知道了這些，捕魚就便利不少。</p>
<p>此外，像魚類的食物也應該注意。一般人都說大魚吃小魚，小魚吃蝦，大蝦吃小蝦。但是小蝦吃什麼呢？如果我們知道了它吃什麼，而且在一個地方發現這種東西，一定可能有魚類的蹤跡。現在我們知道它們最終的食物是海中的藻類，事實證明有藻的塲所，往往有魚蝦同在。不過，我們憂慮藻類恐怕也有一天要被吃光，因此，在海中下肥料是很必需的。可是在中國，陸上植物都吝於下肥料，何况海水是流動的呢！事實上，捕魚這件事是要國際合作的，譬如有一種魚，其生長習性是：小時在中國，稍長到日本，長成後到菲列濱。我們雖可捕小魚，不過也有限度，如果把它一網打盡了的話，日本將沒有中魚，菲列濱也無大魚，可是明年的中國呢？問題倒在這裏。這不像陸上飼養鷄鴨，可知確數多少，而且一定在自己園子裏。</p>
<p>水界比陸界大數倍，可利用的深度更大無數倍，這實在是一個寳藏。假使善於利用的話，人類生生活一定可以比現在改善得多。</p>
<h3>夢遊癥</h3>
<p>— 丁乙</p>
<p>患夢遊症的人，往往在熟睡時遽然而起，能和平日一樣地工作，散步，甚至離家外遊。患者於發作一陣後，仍能熟睡如常，醒後更不知自己剛才做了些什麼。</p>
<p>我國人患此症者，雖無統計，但必也不在少數。下面是美國關於此症的報告與統計。</p>
<p>據調查，美國有二百萬人曾患夢遊症，並且患者也會讀書，寫信，從事工作，搭火車汽車，或者甚至開汽車。雖然科學發達如美國，對於睡眠的秘密亦發掘不少，但是對夢遊症卻仍是無法闡述其原因。然而，有一點是很明顯的，卽夢遊者身體是被他的潛意識所控制，這種潛意識就是我們平日的希望，恐懼與困難的隱藏處。於是一旦夢遊時，患者的潛在慾望便在行動上顯露了出來。</p>
<p>夢遊者又往往有一種偷竊狂，常在夢行時携去同房中人的皮夾。</p>
<p>因爲潛意識通常在智慧中僅佔一小部分，且爲理智的思想所控制，所以平日是不易發作的。</p>
<p>美國某著名小說家亦患有此症，某夜醒後竟發覺自己坐在窗檻上—離地數層樓的房間中。於是他爲安全計，第二天晚上把鎖鎖住自己雙足，且把鑰匙藏於地毯下。雖然是這樣周密的防護，可是午夜醒來時却發覺自己仍坐於窗檻上。以後他每夜用盡技巧安藏鑰匙，可是其結果仍是一樣，可見夢遊時是仍可利用其智慧與記憶力的。</p>
<p>英國某醫學月刊上報告一則新聞，一位婦人能在熟睡中從床上起來，在幾乎全黑的地方寫信及編織最細微的東西。但是當醫生驚醒了她，叫她再做時，她便不能辦到了。</p>
<p>普通的夢遊者，常在睡後二小時發作，—卽是睡眠入於最甜的時候。夢遊維持之久暫各人不同，可能延長數分鐘，數小時，據說甚至幾個月。夢遊者可能遠行到某地居留，或者甚至在那邊成家立業。</p>
<p>治療此病雖無一定方法，但因爲這是屬於心理病態方面，所以醫生須探求其內伏的因素，然後再設法移去其病因。當然，將來科學更發達時，或會有更迅速有效的治法發明的。</p>
<h3>怪法律</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>美國密歇根州最高法院，制訂過這樣一條法律：「老處女，寡婦和謹愼的女性，從床底下窺視一個男子，不足爲神經失常之證據」。</p>
<p>一位紐漢姆郡的法官裁決：「一個女子卽使確定她的丈夫生蝨，她也不得將DDT或其他殺虫劑放在他的食物中。」</p>
<p>阿拉巴瑪州的一個法院，訂下這樣一條法律：「丈夫用手杖打他的不服從的妻子，是完全合法的。但是，手杖的粗細不能超過她的結婚戒的直徑」。</p>
<p>田納西州有一位法官，這樣判決過：「丈夫沒有權力把他的妻子踢下床去，卽使她的雙足是冰冷的。在另一方面，妻子則有權力在任何她所選中的時間，將她的配偶踢下床去，並且不需要說明她踢人的理由」。</p>
<p>紐約法院判決：「電影觀衆在戲院內轉過身去，對正在他後面大聲討論劇情的兩個女子發出輕蔑的噓聲，並不違法，因爲這乃是他權力之內的事」。</p>
<p>紐約法院又有一次在判決理由書中，裁決過這樣一點「當一件事情被一個女子知曉的時候，便無秘密可言了」。</p>
<h3>動物珍詣</h3>
<p>— 蒼雨</p>
<p>世界上最奇怪的昆蟲，名叫亞屈圖蟲。牠經過一定時間後，可變成植物。因爲牠身上有一種菌寄生着，當牠生長至六吋或八吋高時，這亞屈圖　便死去，而蟲形的屍體就依賴土壤而生長。</p>
<p>南美洲產的電鱔，是世界上能發電的魚的領袖，身長八呎，身體裏百分之八十的肌肉，由電質細胞所組成，能運續發出六百伏特二百支光的電力。</p>
<p>非洲西部有一種怪蛇，各叫球蟒蛇，身上斑紋很美，縮做一團，好像一塊花石頭。因爲牠身體小又不咬人，所以小孩們常拿它來玩。</p>
<p>昨日智慧小測驗答案：只要在白天上床就行了。</p>
<h3>和沙遊天兄五十書懷用步原韻</h3>

<h3>Bai Chongxi and Three Others Go to Hangzhou to Urge the President to Assume Office; He Yingqin Will Enter Beijing Tomorrow to Form a Cabinet; It Is Expected That the Legislative Yuan Will Smoothly Approve It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 11th] He Yingqin has agreed to enter Beijing to form a cabinet. This is the result of Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, Gu Zhutong, and Wu Zhongxin, representing Acting President Li, coming to Hangzhou today to urge the president to assume office. Bai and the other three are scheduled to return to Beijing on the 12th to report after congratulating He on his 60th birthday. He will enter Beijing on the 13th to begin forming the cabinet. Today, Bai, Zhang, Gu, and Wu had three earnest talks with He, in the morning, afternoon, and evening. It is widely speculated that these discussions may include the composition of the new cabinet. According to Wei Yongcheng, who accompanied Bai, it is expected that He will receive more than half of the votes of approval in the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the smooth establishment of the new cabinet is almost certain. This afternoon, when our reporter visited Tang's residence, the four representatives of Acting President Li were having lunch with He Yingqin, discussing cabinet matters. He initially expressed concern that with the current precarious state of the country and economic difficulties, he feared he would be unable to handle the position of premier. However, after repeated and firm urging from Bai and the other three, he finally accepted the mission to form a cabinet. Later, the reporter inquired about this matter with General Bai Chongxi, who greeted him with a smile. Although he did not give a definite answer, his joyful demeanor revealed that their mission to urge the president to assume office had been successfully completed without a doubt. In the afternoon, the reporter visited Zhang Zhizhong at the Provincial Government Guesthouse, first saying, "Mr. Zhang, your trip to Xikou must have been tiring." Zhang replied with a smile, "No, no. Xikou has mountains and water; it wasn't tiring." The reporter asked when General Zhang would return to Beijing. He replied, "I'll go back tomorrow." The reporter took the opportunity to ask, "Will Mr. He be going with you?" Zhang replied, "We still need to discuss it tonight." After a moment of thought, he told the reporter, "He can leave tomorrow. Definitely, definitely." After speaking, he hurriedly got into a car and left for Tang's residence. The 12th is the celebration of He's 60th birthday. On the evening of the 11th, Jiang Dingwen hosted a banquet at Tang's residence to warm up the birthday celebration and to welcome Bai, Zhang, Gu, and Wu. After the meal, they discussed the details of cabinet formation before dispersing late at night. Bai Chongxi and the other three arrived at Jianqiao Airport at 10:25 a.m. on the 11th, accompanied by seven staff members. Zhou, Chairman of Zhejiang Provincial Government, Hu Weike, Principal of the Aviation School, and other local officials greeted them. Zhang and Wu stayed at the Provincial Government Guesthouse, while Gu Zhutong stayed with He at Tang's residence. Madam He moved to the Xin Xin Hotel.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li's Official Letter Can Be Delivered in the Morning; Legislative Yuan to Meet This Afternoon; To Exercise the Right of Consent So That He Can Form a Cabinet Quickly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the matter of appointing General He Yingqin to form a cabinet, after Bai Chongxi, Gu Zhutong, Zhang Zhizhong, and Wu Zhongxin went to Hangzhou on the 11th to earnestly urge and discuss, a formal agreement was fully reached at about 7 p.m. on the 11th. Bai Chongxi reported this result to Acting President Li by long-distance telephone at 8 p.m. Bai and others, having completed their mission to urge the president to assume office, are scheduled to return to Beijing from Hangzhou on the 12th to report. Acting President Li hoped that He would also return to Beijing on the same flight, but when Bai spoke to Acting President Li by long-distance telephone at 8 p.m., He had not yet decided whether to return on the 12th. However, this will not affect the Legislative Yuan's exercise of the right of consent.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Acting President Li decided to nominate He Yingqin as President of the Executive Yuan. The official letter nominating him and requesting the Legislative Yuan's consent is scheduled to be delivered to the Legislative Yuan at 9 a.m. on the 12th. Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Chen Kewen, Secretary-General, were notified by telephone at 9 p.m. on the 11th. Tong decided to convene a temporary meeting at 3 p.m. on the 12th, first holding a plenary review meeting to review it, and then exercising the right of consent to quickly decide whether or not to agree, in order to facilitate the formation of the new cabinet. The meeting notice is being rushed out overnight. Acting President Li had originally planned to deliver the official letter to the Legislative Yuan at 9 a.m. on the 11th, but because he had a long-distance telephone call with He Yingqin in Hangzhou on the evening of the 10th, as there were still some details to be discussed, the Presidential Office notified the Legislative Yuan that the official letter might not be sent out on the morning of the 11th. On the morning of the 11th, Acting President Li invited Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, and Gu Zhutong to fly to Hangzhou to earnestly talk with He Yingqin. At 8 p.m. on the evening of the 11th, Bai and others made another long-distance telephone call from Hangzhou, reporting to Acting President Li that some details had been largely resolved. Acting President Li then ordered the Legislative Yuan to be notified at 9 p.m. to prepare to convene a temporary meeting to exercise the right of consent. All parties expressed satisfaction with Acting President Li's nomination of He Yingqin as President of the Executive Yuan. It is expected that the Legislative Yuan will be able to smoothly approve it at the meeting on the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Acting President Li summoned Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, at his official residence at 9:30 p.m. on the 11th to discuss the issue of the Legislative Yuan exercising its right of consent on the nomination of He Yingqin as President of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>In the Form of a Luncheon; Soliciting Opinions from Within the Party</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Acting President Li is scheduled to host a luncheon at the Presidential Office at noon on the 12th to entertain members of the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang and members of the Central Political Conference in Beijing, to solicit their opinions on the nomination of He Yingqin as President of the Executive Yuan. During the luncheon, they will also exchange opinions on the candidates for ministers and political committee members in the future new cabinet. It is widely believed that Acting President Li's move is because, according to Kuomintang custom, the nomination of a party member as President of the Executive Yuan must be approved by the Central Standing Committee. Since the Central Standing Committee cannot be convened in Beijing, he is soliciting the opinions of the members in the form of a luncheon. It is understood that there are more than 20 members of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Conference in Beijing. Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Liu Jianqun, Wu Zhongxin, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, Zhu Jiahua, Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, Cheng Qian, Hong Lanyou, Li Zonghuang, Fan Yisui, Huang Shaoqu, Deng Wenyi, Wang Qijiang, Cheng Siyuan, Ni Wenya, Tang Ruyan, and Huang Yuren have all been invited. As a result, Cheng Qian changed his departure from Beijing to Hunan to the 13th, and Wu Tiecheng also postponed his trip to Shanghai. Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Gu Zhutong, who are urging the president to assume office in Hangzhou, may rush to Beijing from Hangzhou before noon on the 12th to participate and report on their discussions with He Yingqin.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Will Rest and Temporarily Get Away from Politics</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing, 11th] Former President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, told the Associated Press on the 11th that he would temporarily get away from politics and take a rest because he had not rested since returning to China from Europe in 1939. However, he said that he would continue to participate in the work of the ten-member committee drafting the peace plan, because the committee was originally temporary and would be dissolved after the work was completed. He said that the general principles of the peace plan had been drafted. He did not specify where he would go on vacation.</p>
<h3>Another Report on the Sinking of the Chongqing Warship; Guangzhou Newspaper Claims Two Other Warships Were Sunk at the Same Time; Location Is Somewhere Between Dalian and Lushun</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Guangzhou, 11th] According to unconfirmed reports in Guangzhou's Chinese newspapers, the Nationalist Air Force not only sank the "Chongqing" cruiser, but also sank two other warships at the same time. The report said that the bombing location was somewhere between Dalian Port and Lushun Port. It is claimed that all 450 officers and soldiers on the "Chongqing" were killed in the bombing. The government dispatched two other warships to attempt to intercept the "Chongqing," but the Nationalist Air Force sank all three warships. At that time, the "Chongqing" fired anti-aircraft guns in retaliation, but the bombers repeatedly bombed for two hours until all the survivors were killed. The report also said that in addition to the "Chongqing," seven other warships had sailed to the Communist area in the past month.</p>
<h3>Barr and Jones Arrive in San Francisco Together</h3>
<p>[United Press San Francisco, 10th] Barr, head of the US Military Advisory Group to China, and Jones, head of the Military Advisory Group to the Philippines, returned to the country together and arrived here on the 10th. Barr said of his impressions in China that if the authority of the advisory group was not limited to providing advice and teaching, its contribution to China's war effort would be greater. It is a pity that the advisory group was withdrawn. Many members made friends with the Chinese. Jones said that the Philippine armed forces had made rapid progress and would certainly be able to fight side by side with us again against the common enemy.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin's 60th Birthday; Dignitaries in Hangzhou Hold Celebrations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 11th] The 12th is He Yingqin's 60th birthday. Zhang Qiang, Zhang Daofan, Wu Wangji, Fang Qingru, Yu Jimin, and Jin Runquan are scheduled to pay their respects to He at Tang's residence at 8:30 a.m. to offer longevity noodles and set up a simple hall. Tang Enbo is scheduled to come to Hangzhou on the morning of the 12th. Wei Yongcheng, Jiang Dingwen, Yu Shuping, and Chen Wumin have already come to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Unreasonable Price Increases in Postal, Telegraph, and Railway Services; Legislative Yuan Asks for Swift Cessation; Draft for Stopping Conscription of Soldiers and Grain Referred to Committee for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] The price increases in postal, telegraph, and railway services, which took effect on the 11th, sparked strong opposition in the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 11th. The attending committee members unanimously criticized the impropriety of this move and passed a motion to quickly notify the Executive Yuan to stop it and not to recognize the new prices that took effect on the 11th. The Legislative Yuan held its fourth meeting of the third session on the morning of the 11th, with 181 committee members in attendance, presided over by Tong Guanxian. The meeting began at 9:30 a.m. After the report items, Zou Shuwen and others immediately proposed an emergency motion, requesting that the Executive Yuan be notified to quickly stop the price increases in the transportation industry, and that the price increases should not be arbitrarily increased before the methods for adjusting transportation prices and fees in the railway, postal, and telegraph services according to the cost index have been reviewed and approved. The prices announced today should not be recognized. The motion was approved by the meeting and declared for discussion. The committee members spoke one after another, unanimously believing that the postal law stipulates that postal rate increases must go through legislative procedures. Although railway price increases do not require legislative procedures, they should also be approved by the Executive Yuan. The current price increases have not been approved by the Legislative Yuan or the Executive Yuan, which is clearly illegal and should be corrected by the Control Yuan. Moreover, the income of civil servants is based on the cost of living index, but the railway, postal, and telegraph services are not based on the cost of living index, which is also unreasonable. This self-raising price method clearly has the suspicion of undermining the credibility of the Gold Yuan. After a long discussion, the chairman sought the opinions of the meeting and the entire meeting passed it without dissent. The discussion of the motions continued.</p>
<p>The first motion, proposed by Huang Tong and 33 others, proposed to quickly stop the conscription of soldiers and grain. It was resolved that the Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee, the National Defense Committee, and the Food Administration Committee should each recommend five committee members to review it together, with the committee member of the Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee as the convener. Other committee members may participate freely, and a report to the plenary session should be submitted within one week.</p>
<h3>The Draft on Simplifying Administrative Institutions Will Be Reviewed by the 15th</h3>
<p>The second motion, proposed by Chen Guyuan and others, proposed to simplify administrative institutions and first amend Article 3 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law. After the original proposer, Chen Guyuan, explained the reasons, the committee members put forward their opinions on the departments and commissions that should be retained and those that should be merged, including the Water Conservancy Department being reduced to a bureau under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Land Administration Department also being reduced to a bureau, which may be changed to a Land Administration Committee in the future. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry should be changed from a ministry to a division due to its small amount of business. The Labor Bureau should not be directly under the Executive Yuan, but should be under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Mongolian-Tibetan and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committees should be changed to the Mongolian-Tibetan Division and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Division, which are under the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, respectively. The Ministry of Judicial Administration can be handled by the Judicial Yuan, so there is no need to set up a ministry. In addition, some people believe that the simplification of institutions should not be limited to the Executive Yuan, and other Yuans should also be simplified. Overseas Chinese legislators opposed the reduction of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, and Mongolian legislators also opposed the Mongolian-Tibetan Committee being changed to the Mongolian-Tibetan Division. As of 12 o'clock, some people had not had time to speak, and it was decided to continue the discussion in the afternoon, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>The afternoon meeting continued, with 165 people in attendance, still presided over by Tong Guanxian. The discussion on the draft on simplifying the institutions of the Executive Yuan continued. The speakers continued to discuss the retention and merger of various ministries and commissions. Some people argued that the passive meaning is simplification, but in order to express active construction, those that should be established should also be added. Therefore, land administration should still be a ministry, and a "State-owned Enterprises Ministry" should be added to meet the purpose of developing state-owned enterprises in the Principle of People's Livelihood. A certain committee member believed that the revenue and expenditure should be prepared by the Ministry of Finance, and the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics need not be changed to a department, and it should be simply abolished. Finally, it was decided to follow the opinion of the Procedures Committee, and each of the 21 committee members of the Yuan should recommend one person to review it together, with the committee member of the Legal System Committee as the convener. Other committee members may participate freely, and the review should be completed before the 15th and submitted to the plenary session for discussion. Xiang Zhenyu and 21 others were elected to be responsible for the review on the spot.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Holds Secret Meeting; Passes Opinion Paper on Peace; Provides General Principles for Negotiation and Strives to Achieve Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] The Legislative Yuan's plenary session on the 11th changed to a secret meeting at 2:10 p.m. to discuss the peace issue, and reporters were still refused to attend. The meeting was presided over by Tong Guanxian. The secretariat read the report on the peace issue opinions prepared by Huang Yuren and 21 others. Then, Huang Yuren and Lou Youwen explained the preparation process and said that in addition to the report, other committee members' opinions on peace will be collected by the secretariat at any time and sent to the government for reference. The committee members made various amendments to the wording of the opinion paper. Finally, the full text was passed unanimously, and the meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Opinion Paper</h3>
<p>The full text of the peace opinion paper drafted by the Peace Opinion Paper Organizing Committee of the Legislative Yuan is as follows:</p>
<p>Peace is the highest inherent morality of our Chinese nation, and it is also the urgent demand of the whole country at present. For two months, the government has advocated peace, and the Chinese Communists have responded in unison. Although there are differences in opinions and understanding, there is no difference in saving the country and the people. The colleagues of this Yuan come from all over the country and know deeply that the people's desire is to seek a permanent end to the scourge of war, to live and work in peace, to obtain a practical guarantee of basic human rights, and to concentrate the strength of the whole country to reform the status quo and build a unified and progressive new China. Now that formal peace talks are about to begin, it is appropriate to represent the public opinion, make an effective support with the utmost sincerity, and strive to realize the spirit of mutual concession and cooperation, seek the realization of peaceful construction, learn from the lessons of fratricide, eradicate the crisis of internal war, and the colleagues of this Yuan are responsible for this, and are willing to make the greatest efforts to promote its success, and hereby resolve as follows:</p>
<p>(1) During the recess of the second session of this Yuan, this Yuan expresses its approval and support for the government's various measures on peace.</p>
<p>(2) On various major issues, a reasonable solution should be sought in accordance with the principles of political democratization, economic socialization, military nationalization, and legalization of parties, which have been consistently advocated by both sides.</p>
<p>(3) The future peace talks should be handled carefully based on the above-mentioned people's desire for peace and the previous principles.</p>
<h3>President Tong's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, told our reporter on the 11th regarding the peace opinion paper passed by the Legislative Yuan, this opinion was formulated on the general principles of peace, and the purpose is to make both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party agree. The Legislative Yuan does not intend to discuss specific issues, because peace talks are the responsibility of the government, and the Legislative Yuan only provides principles and hopes that the government can proceed based on these principles. If there are any opinions in the future, they should be raised at any time.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Communists Still Express Positively on Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 11th] Although the government is now promoting plans to start peace talks as soon as possible, according to official announcements, the Chinese Communists have not yet shown a positive expression of preparedness to negotiate. Acting President Li is rushing to establish a new cabinet, whose main task is to negotiate peace with the Chinese Communists, but the troops of both sides are still being reorganized and reinforced, and the Communist army is repairing the railways and preparing for a large-scale crossing of the Yangtze River. Most political observers show pessimism about the prospects for peace, believing that although both sides are willing to make peace, their minimum conditions for peace are unacceptable to each other.</p>
<h3>The Wuxi County Council Calls for a Ceasefire and Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi, 11th] The County Council decided at its general meeting on the 11th to send a telegram to Acting President Li and Mr. Mao Zedong, calling for peace, requesting an immediate ceasefire, and appointing senior officials to open peace talks as soon as possible. Any measures that hinder peace should be eliminated as soon as possible, and any contributions that are beneficial to peace should be adopted, so that swords can be turned into plowshares and violence can be turned into auspiciousness.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Concentrates Heavy Troops in Nantong; The 10th Column Originally Stationed in Yangzhou Also Moves East; The Rumor That Nationalist Army Withdraws South from Liuwei Is Not Accurate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 11th] A certain unit of the garrison here denied today the rumor that the Nationalist army withdrew south from the Liuwei bridgehead. A military spokesman said that a certain division of our army stationed in Shijiaqiao, Sanwenhe, Liuwei, Guazhou and other places on the north bank of the Yangtze River is still confronting the Communist army in its original position.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] Military news: The 10th Column, originally stationed in Yangzhou, is now beginning to move towards Taixian. The 9th Column has been confirmed to have been transferred to northern Jiangsu, and the unit is currently near Taixian and is moving east in the same direction as the 10th Column. According to unofficial military intelligence, the destination of the transfer of the two units seems to be the Nantong-Qidong area. In addition to the 9th and 10th Columns, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has the 11th Column in Rugao, which may have been transferred south to the area south of Jingjiang and Rugao. On the Taixian and Haitai sides, there is the 12th Column, which is still in its original position and has not shown any signs of being transferred as of today. On the Tongyu Line, the air force also discovered more than 20,000 troops a week ago moving along the highway towards Dongtai. Whether they continued to move south afterwards, the military has not yet received accurate information. As for the Nantong area, the 104th, 105th, and 106th regiments of the Communist Army's Yangtze River Column were originally stationed there, and the headquarters of the 9th Military Sub-district is also located there. According to the military's past intelligence, the Communist army around Nantong included the Dongru Guard Regiment stationed in Dingyan, the Tongru Detachment stationed in Baipu, the Nantong Guard Regiment stationed in Yudong, the Coastal Defense Regiment stationed in Juegang, and the Southeast Guard Regiment stationed in Juxingzhen.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 11th] Regarding the saying that Xu Shiyou's 10th Corps of the Communist Army was transferred to northern Jiangsu, the military here judged that it was very close to reliable based on intelligence from all sides, and the location of its headquarters should be in Huaiyin. According to captured Nationalist officers who returned from the south, they saw a road sign in the streets of Huaian County indicating the location of the liaison office of the unit, which read "Liaison Office of the 10th Corps."</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing, 11th] A dispatch from Zhenjiang said that more than 10,000 Communist troops, under the cover of heavy artillery, launched a fierce attack on Dahekou, ten miles west of Yizheng on the north bank of the Yangtze River. The situation there is unclear, and clear artillery and machine gun fire can be heard in Yizheng. At the same time, a large team of Communist troops moved south and reached Tianchang, which can be added to the battle in Yizheng.</p>

<h3>Fifty U.S. Senators from Both Parties Request $1.5 Billion in Aid to China; Joint Letter Urges Foreign Relations Committee to Take Swift Action</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, D.C., 10th] Nevada Democratic Senator Pat McCarran released on the evening of the 10th a letter signed by himself and forty-nine other senators to the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tom Connally, urging the committee to take prompt action on McCarran's bill to approve $1.5 billion in military and civilian aid to Nationalist China.</p>
<p>The bill allocates $700 million for military aid, $300 million for civilian relief, and $500 million to stabilize the currency. The original letter reads as follows:</p>
<p>"The bill currently before the Foreign Relations Committee, S. 1063, calls for the United States to establish a definite policy toward Asia, providing effective assistance to the Chinese government on a realistic basis.</p>
<p>"Given the Communist successes in China and the Communist threat to control all of Asia, we cannot ignore our current problems for the sake of national security, and our entire nation cannot waver in the course of action we decide to take. We face problems of such magnitude, complexity, and urgency that further procrastination and hesitation are unwise in the extreme.</p>
<p>"Adopting a defeatist policy, taking a passive attitude, and turning a blind eye at a critical moment for nationalism is inconsistent with America's best traditions.</p>
<p>"While we may have deviated from these traditions in practice – and sometimes in principle – the fundamental responsibility for shaping American policy rests with the United States Congress.</p>
<p>"Therefore, we urge the committee responsible for foreign affairs to begin hearing opinions on the general situation in China and on S. 1063 at the earliest possible date, so that amendments deemed appropriate by the committee can be submitted to the Senate as soon as possible for debate and action.</p>
<p>"This matter – if it truly exists – is not one where Congress must wait for the executive branch of government to make a request before taking action. On the contrary, Congress has the supreme responsibility to clarify this matter and ensure its voice is heard."</p>
<p>An announcement released concurrently with McCarran's letter stated that the signatories included twenty-four Democratic senators and twenty-six Republican senators. The letter does not in any way compel the Foreign Relations Committee to take action on McCarran's bill.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Peace, Struggle. Save China!</h3>
<p>— Reflections on the 24th Anniversary of the Passing of the Father of the Nation —</p>
<p>Looking north to Biyun Temple, gazing south at Purple Mountain, every year on this day, we pay tribute to the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, recalling the past, encouraging each other to follow the Three Principles of the People; but how many members of the Kuomintang can truly and deeply reflect and resolutely strive forward? Today, Biyun Temple has fallen into the hands of the Chinese Communist army, and Purple Mountain is almost under the threat of Communist artillery fire. Separated by a narrow strip of water, a myriad of sorrows fill our hearts! The Chinese Kuomintang today, from the central cadres to all party members, must feel ashamed and guilty, feeling that they have no face to face Dr. Sun's spirit in heaven. Although Acting President Li Zongren, President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke, and other important figures can still ascend Purple Mountain today to visit Dr. Sun's mausoleum and gaze upon his remains, I know that if they have any conscience, they will feel ashamed and regretful. As for the general Kuomintang members who claim to follow the teachings of the Father of the Nation, the best among them only seek to preserve their integrity, or feign madness out of indignation, or end their days in sorrow, or sink into the lower ranks, or retreat into the mountains, while the unworthy sell official positions, seize power, engage in deceitful diplomacy, and switch allegiances frequently. For the past twenty years, the Principle of People's Livelihood has been shelved, allowing the teachings of the Father of the Nation to fail to be promoted and developed. Looking back at the rise and fall of the Kuomintang since Dr. Sun's death, "Although it is said to be destiny, is it not also due to human affairs?"</p>
<p>The Father of the Nation deeply understood the difficulty of building a nation, so he advocated revolutionary nation-building and struggled for it for forty years, unyielding until the last moment of his life, when he earnestly admonished his followers, "The revolution has not yet succeeded; comrades must continue to strive." And what is especially valuable is that he pointed out a broad and smooth road for revolutionary nation-building: "Peace, struggle, save China!" Interpreted literally, this last testament is also very simple. These seven characters mean that what China urgently needs most is peace, but peace cannot fall from the sky, nor is it readily available; it requires the joint efforts of the people of the country who yearn for peace: only through struggle can peace be achieved, and only when peace is achieved can China be saved. In the past twenty-four years, except for the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan to fight for the survival of the nation, whether during the Northern Expedition or in the three years of civil war after the victory of the War of Resistance, we have not tasted the true meaning of this last testament of the Father of the Nation. But in today's environment, reading the Father of the Nation's will, we feel especially that the Father of the Nation's last words have profound meaning and are full of infinite truth. Unfortunately, we did not have the great wisdom and courage to do it practically before. If we do not catch up now, seize the opportunity, and do it practically, the opportunity will pass quickly. If we waste the good years in disagreements and infighting, we will not only fail the Father of the Nation's spirit in heaven, but also become a sinner of the nation!</p>
<p>The Three Principles of the People should still be the only way to revolutionary nation-building today. The reason why the overall situation of the country is so bad today and why the Kuomintang has failed is definitely not the fault of the Three Principles of the People, but the fault of the Kuomintang members for not truly striving to promote the Three Principles of the People. The Communist Party seems to be afraid to openly advocate communism today, and calls it New Democracy, forcing the people of North China to learn it together, which proves that China should still be a world of the Three Principles of the People. In terms of nationalism: although we are willing to sacrifice everything to obtain national freedom and equality, we are determined not to invade, nor do we intend to force other countries to follow us; internally, we advocate that all ethnic groups in the country are equal, everyone lives in peace, and we do not want the problem of ethnic minorities to occur, in order to maintain permanent peace in the country. In terms of civil rights: the Father of the Nation's goal was to make the people of the country completely equal in law and politics, and to divide political power and governing power, so that the government and the people can cooperate seamlessly and operate freely; and the central and local governments take the principle of balanced power, so that the historical division and reunification will not be repeated in the future. In terms of people's livelihood: from the beginning, it advocates labor-capital coordination, gradually eliminating the existence of classes, and equalizing land ownership and regulating capital can make the social economy obtain a long-term stable foundation. Therefore, the Father of the Nation's revolutionary theory is completely based on peace; his life engaged in revolution can be said to be completely for the peace of China, and at the same time, it can also be said to be for the peace of the world. In the national desire for peace, commemorating the death of the Father of the Nation, we, the people, especially the Kuomintang members, must take this opportunity to deeply reflect. The peace that we must strive to achieve in the future should be the peace that does not violate Dr. Sun's teachings, and should be the peace built on the foundation of determinedly implementing the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must know why we demand peace, because we want to "save China." Therefore, saving China is the goal, and peace is the method. Assuming that everyone only knows how to shout for peace, but does not ask how to obtain peace and what kind of peace is obtained, in other words, only seeking the completion of the form of peace, and regardless of whether it can lead China to the road of salvation, then is that not the original intention of Dr. Sun's last testament? Now, in the Communist areas, people are forced to learn New Democracy every day and study Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions, as if these are the golden rules for the future. However, I have not heard that Kuomintang members and followers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People still have the courage to believe that the thorough implementation of the Three Principles of the People is the first and foremost meaning of peace, which is really puzzling.</p>
<p>Whether it is a political party or a political reform movement, military failure is not enough to worry about, political failure is not enough to worry about, only spiritual failure is truly worrying. The Kuomintang today, regardless of whether the overall situation is resolved or not, cannot but consider that it has suffered a major failure. But this failure will not erase the Kuomintang's past great contributions to the nation, nor will it cut off the Kuomintang's future path to make efforts for the nation, as long as the Kuomintang members' spirit can be undaunted and undefeated. And today, what the Kuomintang needs to be cautious and fearful of, and strive to remedy, is precisely in this spirit! We hope to see the revival of the Kuomintang's spirit on the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation!</p>

<h3>Eight-Nation Atlantic Treaty Negotiations Concluded; Full Text to be Released Next Wednesday; Acheson-Danish Foreign Minister Talks Begin; Italian Prime Minister Announces Decision to Join the Treaty to Parliament</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 11th (Broadcast): Acheson met with Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen and Danish Ambassador to the United States Kauffmann this afternoon, initiating talks regarding Denmark's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. Hickerson, Director of the Office of European Affairs at the State Department, was also present.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] U.S. Secretary of State Acheson convened the ambassadors of seven countries – Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, and Canada – today for the final meeting regarding the North Atlantic Treaty. Before attending, British Ambassador Franks told reporters that after today's meeting, there would be no further meetings between the participating countries and the U.S. State Department regarding the treaty. Discussions on the treaty have concluded, and it will be ready for signing once approved by the respective governments. Today's meeting at the State Department focused on studying the reactions of European governments to the treaty. The treaty is expected to be released around next Wednesday, with signing scheduled for April 5th. According to dispatches from Rome, Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi announced the decision of Italy to join the treaty in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon. Observers generally believe that De Gasperi's statement will be a strong response to the recent announcement by Italian Communist leader Togliatti supporting the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 11th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi told 400 members of the Christian Democratic Party in both houses of parliament on the 11th that the Atlantic Treaty does not necessarily mean that Italy will participate in an actual war should a global conflict begin. Parliament will debate the Atlantic Treaty issue this afternoon, at which time De Gasperi will deliver a speech. De Gasperi stated that it is not stipulated that "participation in the treaty means Italy automatically enters the war. Even if war unfortunately breaks out, Italy does not need to go to the battlefield but will undertake a special non-combat role."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen arrived here today from Europe to review the possibility of Denmark joining the North Atlantic Treaty. Given Greenland's important strategic position in the Atlantic, Denmark's participation in the treaty is of particular significance. Under the wartime treaty that is still in effect, the United States has the right to use bases in Greenland. It is believed here that if Denmark joins the treaty, the use of Greenland's bases by other countries under the treaty will be handled by the collective security mechanisms established under the treaty. A Danish spokesman here solemnly stated that the establishment of bases on Danish soil has not yet been discussed, except in the event that Denmark is attacked or threatened with attack.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Aid Plan Includes Turkey, Greece, Iran, South Korea, and the Philippines; Acheson Attends Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Explain</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 11th (Broadcast): Acheson conferred with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this afternoon regarding the foreign military aid bill.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Government officials revealed on the 10th that the government's military aid program will be submitted to Congress for consideration in early April. This bill will request appropriations to purchase military equipment for signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty and other countries oppressed by the Communist Party, including Greece, Turkey, the Philippines, South Korea, and Latin American republics.</p>
<p>Officials said that accelerated consideration of aid to Iran is due to increased pressure from the Soviet Union on that oil-rich country. According to current plans, the government will request 1.5 billion in the aid fund to address emergency situations affecting U.S. interests in Atlantic Treaty countries, Iran, and non-communist countries.</p>
<h3>Republican Senator Brewster Advocates Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Republican Senator Brewster of the Senate Armed Services Committee expressed dissent on the 10th regarding the inclusion of the Philippines, Iran, and South Korea in the military aid bill. He stated that if the United States plans to provide military supplies to countries outside Europe, it should also provide them to the "independent government of China." He said, "At this time, the best place to send surplus military supplies to fight for freedom is to the independent government of China, which is fighting against communism. But if surplus military supplies from the European plan are given to China, it will be unsatisfactory because they are unwanted military supplies. This will be too late and too little."</p>
<h3>British-Turkish Talks Held</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Turkish Ambassador to Britain Acikalin today, and they likely discussed regional defense measures. Observers believe that the discussions involved: (1) Soviet activities in the Ankara area and Turkey's ability to join the Mediterranean regional defense pact; (2) a declaration regarding Turkey, Greece, and Iran to be issued by Britain, the United States, and France when the Atlantic Treaty is signed; (3) Turkey's non-invitation to the meeting to be held in London to discuss the establishment of a European Council. It is believed here that Turkey felt disappointed by the invitation extended to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Italy and Ireland to attend the London meeting on establishing a European Council, hence the Turkish ambassador's visit to Bevin.</p>
<h3>Four Powers Discuss Austrian Peace Treaty; Agree to U.S. Proposal</h3>
<p>Each to Draft Proposals for Resolving South Tyrol Dispute</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 11th (Broadcast): After the meeting of the representatives of the four foreign ministers today, U.S. representative Reber immediately proposed that the four powers each submit concrete proposals to resolve the South Tyrol dispute, especially explaining their attitude towards the treatment of ethnic minorities. Britain and France expressed their support. Soviet representative Zarubin clearly wanted to delay the process and proposed that the Western countries first submit a written proposal on the territorial demands of South Tyrol, which the Western countries opposed. The British representative expressed a willingness to submit a written text of the treaty guaranteeing the territorial integrity of Austria after World War I on Monday for the representatives to consider, to which the Soviet representative agreed. Therefore, the Soviet side will have to submit concrete opinions on resolving the stalemate no earlier than next Monday.</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Budget is Huge; Totaling Approximately $15 Billion; Supreme Soviet Begins Review</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 10th] The fifth Supreme Soviet convened at the Kremlin this afternoon. Premier Stalin, First Deputy Premier Molotov, Deputy Premier Mikoyan, new Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, and Politburo members Malenkov, Voroshilov, Shvernik, Suslov, Kaganovich, and Beria were all present. The agenda will include reviewing the 1949 federal budget and reporting on last year's budget. The congress will also approve various decrees issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet since the fourth session.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 10th] Soviet Finance Minister Zverev presented the largest budget in Soviet history at the joint meeting of the Federal Council and the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet tonight, requesting an allocation of 79 billion rubles for national defense expenditures this year, an increase of approximately 20% over last year. The new budget stipulates total national treasury revenue for this year at 445.28 billion rubles and total expenditures at 415.355 billion rubles, with a surplus of 30 billion rubles. Last year's total revenue was 408.4 billion rubles, total expenditures were 368 billion rubles, and the surplus was 39.6 billion rubles. Although there is currently no free market to determine the international exchange rate of the ruble, according to the official rate, one ruble is approximately equal to 19 U.S. cents. Based on this, the current Soviet military budget is equivalent to $15 billion. (Note: The total U.S. budget for this year is $41.858 billion, of which $14.3 billion is for national defense expenditures.) An accurate comparison of the military budgets of the United States and the Soviet Union is not possible due to different items, price fluctuations, and the lack of sufficient reports from the Soviet Union on the above factors. Zverev declared that the increase in national defense expenditures was largely due to the rise in wholesale prices after the government abolished subsidies, but the Soviet Union will continue to pursue a policy of world peace. He also vehemently criticized the United States, accusing the United States of being responsible for the current chaotic international situation, stating that the U.S. military budget this year is more than 15 times that of 1937. Zverev also criticized Britain's increase in defense expenditures.</p>

<p>The report stated: The basic economic goal of the U.S. military government is to "cultivate Korea's economy so that it can be free from the control of Japan or any foreign country in order to ensure political independence." However, due to "economic dislocation and material shortages, agricultural production has decreased." At the same time, "the implementation of basic policies has been restricted due to the obstruction and sabotage of local minority groups."</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 11th] President Syngman Rhee told South Korean journalists on the 11th: He fully supports the "eventual" withdrawal of U.S. troops, but "we all agree that before the U.S. troops withdraw, we must first equip and train the national defense forces. We are not asking U.S. troops to remain to protect us, but we are asking that at least a small number of troops be retained to help us train our troops." He stated that raising the issue of U.S. troop withdrawal at this time is tantamount to supporting Soviet policy.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th] The United Nations Security Council is virtually facing a stalemate regarding the Indonesian issue. Diplomats dare not predict how the case will develop in the future.

Van Royen continued that the Netherlands' proposal is a genuine concession and sacrifice.

He demanded that international authorities investigate the methods used by the Dutch army in Indonesia. A spokesman for the U.S. representative revealed that the United States also intends to take a firm stance towards the Netherlands.

<h3>Britain Hopes India Will Amend Constitution; Maintain Dominion Relationship</h3>
<p>Deeply Concerned About Nehru's Remarks</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 11th (Broadcast): According to official news, after Australian Foreign Minister Evatt came here from New Delhi, the British government immediately dispatched four special envoys to various dominions. It is said that Nehru informed Evatt of the content of India's future constitution, and Evatt immediately relayed it to British Prime Minister Attlee. Evatt repeatedly stated that among the countries in Southeast Asia, only India has the strength to be a bulwark against communism. Therefore, Evatt earnestly requested Prime Minister and Bevin to strive for an agreement with the dominion countries to ensure that India can become an independent republic while still maintaining a dominion relationship. However, the Indian Communist Party strongly opposes this, claiming that Britain and the United States are plotting to launch a "capitalist offensive" in India. The British government is deeply concerned about this pressure on Nehru, and therefore urgently seeks to remedy the situation in the Indian constitution, ensuring that under any political system, India can maintain a consistent pace with other dominions in "preserving the democratic forces in the Far East."</p>

<h3>Loan for Public Utilities; National Bank Promises to Lend in Kind; Quantity of Oil, Coal, etc. Needed to be Determined Every Half Month for Purchase; Council to Review Pricing Basis Today</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Municipal Council, the pricing basis review representatives, together with the Director and Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, conducted a review of the accounts of various public utility companies at the Public Utilities Bureau conference room starting at 10:00 AM yesterday and discussed the amount of the loan to be obtained from the National Bank and the procedures to be followed. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, they went to the National Bank together to consult with President Liu on the loan issue. Those who went together included Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue, Councilors Zhang Zhongyuan, Jiang Hao, Wang Zhuyi, Ma Junshuo, Jiang Haoran, Shi Zongde, etc. According to President Liu: In order to maintain public utilities, the National Bank has an unshirkable duty to lend. However, lending a large amount of money seems inappropriate. At this time, when the National Bank is ordered to suppress prices and tighten credit, if the National Bank lends a large amount of cash, it will inevitably flow into the market and affect price increases. After consulting with Minister of Finance Xu Kan, it was deemed that public utility loans should be handled in two aspects: (1) Each company can submit the minimum quantity of fuel oil, coal, and materials needed every half month to the Public Utilities Bureau for review, and then submit it to the National Bank for purchase and direct lending in kind to the company. When the end of the second half of the month arrives, the payment should be made based on the market price at the time of purchase plus interest. (2) If trolley companies, etc., have economic difficulties in making salary payments, the National Bank can grant cash loans as appropriate. The Municipal Council believes that the method proposed by the National Bank is reasonable in that it avoids affecting the market economy, and that the operations of various companies can continue to be maintained after lending in kind. Therefore, the loan principles have been determined. However, this is a temporary solution. In the future, the adjustment of public utility prices must be based on multiples of the cost of living index. The representatives of the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Municipal Council who reviewed the pricing basis decided to continue to hold a meeting in the Public Utilities Bureau conference room at 10:00 AM today to review and determine the pricing basis of various public utility units.</p>
<h3>Coal Shortage on Two Railway Lines Temporarily Resolved; National Bank Approves Advance Payment of Funds for 5,000 Tons of Coal; Number of Passengers Scarce on First Day of Fare Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The coal shortage problem of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has now been temporarily alleviated. The Central Bank of the city was ordered by the Ministry of Finance yesterday to allow the bureau to raise funds for 5,000 tons of coal. The bureau purchased 1,400 tons of bituminous coal on the same day, and the coal payment was directly allocated by the National Bank to the Four Mines Joint Operations Office and the Bituminous Coal Adjustment Committee. The remaining 3,600 tons are still under negotiation. The bureau hopes to complete this within a few days to avoid rising coal prices. According to a spokesman for the bureau, the coal shortage can be temporarily resolved after all 5,000 tons of coal are purchased. However, efforts still need to be made to reorganize railway revenue to increase the economy and seek self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday was the first day that the bureau adjusted fares. Passengers, unable to afford the high fares, reduced their travel class. Therefore, there were few passengers in first-class carriages. Only about 200 first-class tickets were sold at the North Station throughout the day.</p>

<h3>Director of Public Utilities Bureau Reports on Water Supply Situation in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue reported on the project to solve the water shortage in West Shanghai at the municipal conference yesterday, stating: The project to connect the water supply of West Shanghai to the Nanshi Water Plant is the central task of the Public Utilities Bureau in the 37th year of the Republic (1948), and the purpose is to transport the surplus water from the inland water plant to the pumping station at the Zhongzheng West Road reservoir.

<h3>German Doctor Extorted, Three Defendants Released on Bail for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The three defendants accused of extorting Dr. Stolar, a German overseas Chinese doctor - Barten, former deputy leader of the Economic Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau, Vasilief, a foreign affairs police officer, and Grichnen, a Soviet real estate businessman - appeared in court yesterday afternoon in response to the summons of Judge Wang Kanghou of the District Court. They met the plaintiff, Stolar, for the first time in court, and all denied that they had colluded in extortion. After a patient hearing in court, the judge ordered further trials after important witnesses were summoned. Defendant Barten was ordered to pay a written guarantee of 500,000 yuan, and the other two defendants were each ordered to pay a written guarantee of 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The accusations against the defendants are as follows: Stolar was familiar with Hoven (on the run), a Soviet foreign affairs police officer from the police station. Stolar had a self-defense pistol and had entrusted Hoven to obtain a gun license on his behalf. Unexpectedly, he was later suspected of selling arms and was summoned by the Changshu Branch on December 24th of last year. It happened that Grichnen, who was familiar with Stolar, was at the bureau to renew his residence permit, so he took the opportunity to persuade Stolar to give Barten and Vasilief US$500 to settle the case. Stolar pretended to cooperate, and then Grichnen repeatedly demanded payment and arranged to go to Stolar's residence on Sichuan Road on the 30th of the same month to pay the money. Stolar reported to the police station, who sent officers to wait. As a result, the case was solved on that day, and the defendants were arrested.</p>
<h3>Jue Lu Hotel Shooting Incident, Four Accomplices Continue to be Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the night of February 27th, Zhu Yuanming, a contractor, was shot and wounded in the abdomen next to the escalator on the fourth floor of the Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Middle Road. Duan Zixin and Wang Songlin (soldiers), the perpetrators, were arrested on the spot by the Laozha Police Station. They admitted to the crime and stated that they used to specialize in pickpocketing at the Longhua Airport. Later, Zhu Yuanming found out about it, and they feared that he would report them to the police for wanted status. Therefore, they gathered four soldiers, carrying Type 38 rifles, to negotiate with Zhu. They first met at the entrance of Sanyuanfang on Xizang Road, but Zhu cleverly escaped. They chased him to the fourth floor of the Jue Lu Hotel, intercepted him, and attempted to extort two taels of gold from him without success, so they shot him and injured him. At the same time, they confessed to having committed numerous crimes, including stealing a large sum of money from the travel bag of wood merchant Diao Jinwen, etc. The other day, the Laozha Branch received a tip-off that accomplices in the case were hiding in a room at the Jinshan Hotel. Zhang Kuidong, the director of the squadron, ordered Inspector Pang Yihua to lead police officers Yang Zhongming and others to rush to the address.

<h3>Employees Pre-borrowing Salaries, Social Bureau Does Not Accept, French Electricity Asks Management for Opinions, Director Shen Instructs to Negotiate Independently</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Gotron, the management representative of the French Tram Company, visited the Social Bureau yesterday to discuss the pre-borrowing of salaries for the company's employees. It is said that the employees are requesting to be paid 15 days early each month to cope with the rising prices. The management replied that it could be considered if a loan from the Central Bank was successful, otherwise there was no hope. Director Shen of the Labor Department instructed them to handle the matter through independent negotiation, and the Social Bureau does not intend to participate in this request.</p>
<p>Regarding the pre-borrowing of salaries for employees, the reporter interviewed Director Shen of the Labor Department of the Social Bureau yesterday. According to him: Although he had heard about this matter, neither the labor nor the management has made a formal request so far, so it is not appropriate to consider any measures. As far as the current situation is concerned, the hardship of the workers' lives and the difficulty of the management's production and sales are both true facts. The Social Bureau should take care of both parties. The situations of various industries are different. If there is such a request, it should be negotiated independently by the labor and management. If the management's strength can bear it, it can be handled after consultation. However, this is not a statutory system, and the Social Bureau will not accept or mediate any labor disputes of this kind.</p>

<h3>No Longer Levying Vegetable Supply Fees and Self-Defense Donations Separately from Each District, Report to the Civil Affairs Bureau for Investigation if There is Forced Apportionment</h3>
<p>Regarding the issues of vegetable supply for the garrison troops and the collection of self-defense donations in this city, Director Zhang of the Civil Affairs Bureau stated yesterday: In February, due to the inability of the military-civilian cooperative societies in each district to be established and the failure to raise funds for vegetable supply on schedule, the military-civilian cooperation committee decided to temporarily allow each district to apportion the supply locally, which will be reimbursed by the municipal government in the future. From March 1st, the vegetable supply fees will be allocated by the municipal government, and no longer apportioned by the districts. The funds for the self-defense teams of the people in each district will also be included in the municipal government's budget, and there will be no separate orders for each district to raise donations on its own. It has been reported that some districts are still apportioning vegetable supply fees to citizens and arbitrarily levying self-defense donations.

<h3>Forced Landing in Jinan, CNAC Pilot Continues to Talk About Experience, One Woman Among Those Who "Contributed" to Hijacking, Shot at While Flying Over Jinan Airspace</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After returning safely from being detained for 38 days after being forced to land in Jinan, the American pilot Hershelk of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight 135, from Shanghai to Qingdao, added the following details to the reporter: There were six passengers who hijacked the plane, one of whom was a woman holding a baby. They all spoke fluent English, as if they had been to the United States. He could not determine whether they were communist personnel, because when the plane flew over Jinan airspace, it was shot at by the communist army on the ground, which obviously did not expect the arrival of the plane. However, after landing, these passengers handed him and other passengers over to the communist authorities. Later, during the detention, several of them came to meet him. The leader, wearing military uniform, repeatedly expressed his apology. He was questioned three times by the communist authorities, and what was asked was his personal experience and information about CNAC and the US Air Force. He was deeply puzzled by their reasons for hijacking the plane. According to his guess: their purpose may not have been to obtain the plane, or it may have been because they wanted to go to Jinan, so they took this fastest route.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Qingdao on the 11th] The reporter obtained confirmation from CNAC passengers who disappeared in Jinan (who returned to Qingdao safely on the evening of the 8th) that the hijackers were four officers dismissed from the Air Force, who, in addition to hijacking the plane to the communist area to "contribute", had no other purpose. When they were detained, they were treated like criminals, eating corn buns and pickles, but when they were released, the communists killed chickens and set out wine to entertain them.</p>
<h3>Stories of the Literary World, Fan Xuejun Receives the Most Votes, Not Elected as Queen of Storytelling, Second Place Xu Xueyue, Princess Zhang Lijun</h3>
<p>Crowning Ceremony to be Held at Lido on the 19th</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In 1946, the election of Miss Shanghai and Singing Queen caused a sensation. In the three years since then, there have been no similar grand events. Recently, the storytelling and ballad singing circles are unwilling to be lonely and have launched an election for the Queen of Storytelling. A few days ago, the "Shanghai Literary World Weekly" issued 24,000 ballots commissioned by various storytelling venues in this city. After the "ballad singing fans" voted, famous female ballad singer Fan Xuejun was elected Queen with 2,405 votes. Xu Xueyue, nicknamed "Little Old Lady", was elected Second Place with 1,942 votes. Zhang Lijun, known for singing "Yang Naiwu and Little Cabbage", received 1,368 votes and was elected Princess. For this reason, the literary world in this city has specially formed a "Preparatory Committee for the Crowning Ceremony of the Queen of Storytelling", which is responsible for the preparations by Yang Binkui, Director of Guangyu Society, Chen Zizhen, representative of the storytelling venue, and Zhang Jianfan, Gao Shangde, etc. It has been decided that the crowning ceremony will be officially held at the Lido Garden at 1:30 p.m. on the 19th of this month. Huang Jinrong and Yan Duhe will be invited to attend and preside over the crowning ceremony. The "Queen's Crown" was donated by Ding Baoying, Fan Xuejun's godmother, and is currently being rushed to be made by specialized technicians in the style of the Dutch Queen's crown. The crown is made of pure gold, and the labor costs alone require hundreds of US dollars, so it is extremely valuable. Fan is famous in the literary world for singing "Begonia", and is currently the only popular figure in the storytelling and ballad singing circles. Because of her excellent appearance and skills, she has more than 10,000 fans and listeners. She broadcasts on the radio for one hour every night and requires a basic salary of 1,500 yuan per month, which shows how popular she is. As for the Second Place Xu Xueyue and Princess Zhang Lijun, they are still singing in Changzhou, and those who are captivated by their pipa music are also quite numerous. On the day of the crowning ceremony, all the "Xiangdang" in Jiangnan will gather in Shanghai to attend the ceremony. (Attached is a recent photo of Fan Xuejun, taken by this newspaper)</p>

However, Wei Wenhua and Shen Dongmei did not arrive. It is said that Mr. Wei suffered from a "severe cold" after returning to Shanghai and declined all public gatherings and private visits. After the meeting was opened, Chairman Hong Nianzu reported the purpose of the meeting, and then invited Zhang Feng to talk about his experiences in the North. Mr. Zhang said: This trip to Peiping was far more fruitful than expected. He personally is very optimistic about the prospects for peace. After this visit, all previous doubts about the sincerity of the CCP for peace have been answered affirmatively. Although whether true peace can be achieved still depends on the official dispatch of representatives by both the KMT and the CCP to negotiate, it is beyond doubt that peace talks can be realized. Being able to achieve peace talks is enough to indicate that everything is open to negotiation.</p>
<p>Factories Have No Major Losses</p>
<p>Mao Zedong's industrial and commercial policy has sixteen characters: "Develop production, prosper the economy, consider both public and private, benefit both labor and capital." All factories have started work and increased production. Labor-management relations are very good under the principle of "mutual benefit". Except for the Tianjin Zhong Textile Factory 7, which was destroyed by artillery fire, all factories have no major losses. The "takeover" of state-owned enterprises only involves sending a small number of personnel to supervise, and there is very little interference with private factories. The "learning" trend in Peiping is very strong. Regardless of institutions, schools, or factories, they are enthusiastically engaged in "learning". The so-called "learning" means learning the CCP's ideology and style. For example, when the communist army first entered the city, Peiping municipal government personnel took off their suits and leather shoes and hid them, not wearing them. After learning about this, Ye Jianying immediately summoned all his subordinates and gave them a lecture, telling them that there was no need to put aside their original Western clothes and not wear them. In the future, being able to advocate thrift and use less foreign goods is enough. Therefore, Western-dressed customers reappeared on the streets of Peiping. The currency system in the communist area is based on the Renminbi, and various local currencies will be gradually withdrawn. "Yuan Datou" and "US dollars" were still commonly used at that time, and transactions were very active. Approximately 15 "Datou" could be exchanged for one US dollar.</p>
<p>Technical Personnel Receive Slightly Higher Treatment</p>
<p>The Communist Party also recognizes the Three People's Principles, and especially emphasizes the Principle of People's Livelihood. The style is quite moderate. The negotiations on opening air and postal services were very successful, and flights are also being restored, even including the China National Aviation Corporation, which has foreign shares, but is not made an exception. In terms of industry, the Communist Party has slightly increased the treatment of technical personnel, and everything else is generally the same as the old system. Salaries are based on millet, etc. After Mr. Zhang's report, the association discussed the issue of barter trade with North China; Tian Heqing, Fu Liangjun, Xie Tiansha, Wang Guoxian, Pan Shihao, Ye Fokang, Guo Yongxi and others all spoke enthusiastically. Generally, Tian, Fu, Ye and others believed that barter trade with North China was urgent, otherwise the factories in Shanghai would not be able to survive due to the lack of raw materials and the stagnation of finished products. Pan and Guo and others believed that it was only necessary to conduct research at present, and it was not possible to talk about barter trade, and it was not appropriate to act rashly without obtaining the consent of Director Du. Finally, it was decided that Secretary-General Ouyang Lun of the Industrial Association would report this situation to Director Du, and Du and Wei Wenhuan would first establish contact with them so that they could understand the situation in North China. At the same time, various industries are preparing data for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Tricycles to Sail to North China Immediately, Hong Kong Business Circles Express Optimism About the Prospect of Trade</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Hong Kong, 11th] In order to formally restore trade between Hong Kong and North China, three ships will set sail for the Communist area within 48 hours. Two are ships of the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and one is a Panamanian freighter chartered by Chinese businessmen, for the purpose of exchanging goods between Hong Kong, Tianjin, and Weihaiwei. Another ship belonging to Swire Shipping will also sail from Hong Kong to the North China region for a trial voyage. Business circles here are paying close attention to this and are expressing a rather optimistic attitude towards the matter. They pointed out that the CCP authorities are extremely willing to use the seaports of the Northeast to trade with the outside world.</p>

<h3>China's Mecca: Pilgrimage to Hezhou</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Song Lin</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Lanzhou, July 7] In the eastern foothills of Mount Jishi, in the middle and lower reaches of the Daxia River, lies a hilly region. Looking from afar, one sees temples of various sizes standing every three to five li among the mountains, valleys, plains. This is China's Mecca - Hezhou.</p>
<p>Hezhou was called Fenglin Post Station in the Han Dynasty, Baohan Prefecture in the Tang Dynasty, and Hezhou Guard in the Ming Dynasty. Since the Republic of China, it was first renamed Daohe County, and is now called Linxia County. The name "Linxia" is relatively new, and many people are unfamiliar with it, but when Gansu's Hezhou is mentioned, everyone says they have long admired its name.</p>
<p>Center of Faith for Hui Compatriots</p>
<p>Although Hezhou is just one of more than two thousand counties in the country, this county does have unique characteristics. It not only produced one member of the National Government (Ma Lin), six provincial chairmen (Ma Fuxiang, Ma Qi, Ma Fushou, Ma Hongbin, Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui), and four army commanders (Ma Buqing, Ma Jiyuan, Ma Chengxiang, Ma Dunjing), but it is also a prominent Hui Muslim area, the center of faith for Hui compatriots. In the past, due to poor transportation, people generally had a mystical sense of allure and terror mixed together, regarding it as a special region. In the past, some busybodies may have deliberately exaggerated this to increase the distance between the local area and the central government, seeking opportunities to advance their own interests. But now, they have long embarked on the path of sincere unity. If there is still anything special, it is only that some people have different religions and customs from people in other places.</p>
<p>Hezhou governs four counties: Linxia, Yongjing, Hezheng, and Ningding (now, when people generally speak of Hezhou, they narrowly refer only to Linxia County). The total population of the region is more than 443,000, of which Muslims account for more than half, scattered in every corner of the four counties. In the eastern part of Linxia and the northern part of Ningding, a mountainous area of ​​fifty kilometers has many people scattered in cave dwellings, living a simple life of cave dwelling and farming. They are firm in character, live a hard life, and devoutly believe in Islam, but they are of Mongolian descent. According to research, a branch of the Mongolian royal family of the Yuan Dynasty converted to Islam. Because they were exiled, they wandered to the barren and sparsely populated Dongxiang area of Hezhou before settling down. After five or six hundred years of reproduction, there are now nearly 100,000 people. Many of the place names in this area use Mongolian sounds. The Mongolian script has been completely lost, but the Mongolian language still has an unwavering presence. Many of them only know Mongolian and are not familiar with other languages, especially women. Scholars who study Mongolian, if they can come here to do a comparative study of general Mongolian and the Mongolian language of this place, will surely discover many valuable materials.</p>
<p>Thousands of Mosques</p>
<p>In the small area of ​​Hezhou, the respect and sacredness of religion amaze outsiders. The 200,000 Hui compatriots in Hezhou, regardless of the difficulties of life and the poverty of the environment, enthusiastically and devoutly support religion and become faithful believers. Within the Hezhou area, every three to five li, wherever there are Muslims living, there is a mosque, with the number reaching thousands. They do not hesitate to spend huge sums of money, preferring to live in leaky, wind-blown broken houses, or dark cave dwellings, but they gather their strength to build mosques that are majestic, magnificent, carved with beams and painted rafters, and as luxurious as ancient palaces. The mosque is the center of Islam. In larger mosques, there are theological universities with dozens of university students studying religious philosophy. Every year, university students from all over the province and from Yunnan, Guizhou, Beijing, Shanghai and other places come to study scriptures in an endless stream. The status of Hezhou in Chinese Islamic academics can be imagined from this.</p>
<p>Ahong and His Followers</p>
<p>The Ahong is the authority of Islam. In every mosque, there is an Ahong presiding over it. They are in charge of religious rituals, religious laws, expound religious doctrines, educate students, and lead the Muslim community. Every Muslim is extremely respectful of their Ahong. These hundreds of thousands of faithful followers pray to their true God five times a day: morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night. Whenever it is time for prayer, those walking stop, and those farming put down their hoes and plows and go to the mosque, or simply in the fields, facing west, they pray according to religious rituals. That kind of devout behavior cannot help but remind people of Millet's famous painting "The Angelus."</p>
<p>Every year during the month of Ramadan, they spend all their time on religious studies. Businessmen stop doing business, and farmers put away their farming tools—except for military, government, and educational personnel who do not have freedom, everyone else concentrates on fasting and praying. Therefore, the religious atmosphere is particularly strong during this month. They do not drink or eat from dawn to sunset, and do not even swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>In the year, Islam has only two grand festivals, one is "Eid al-Fitr" and the other is "Eid al-Adha".</p>
<p>Lively Eid al-Fitr</p>
<p>Every time "Eid al-Fitr" comes, every household prepares fried dough twists and meat to celebrate each other, and it is very lively. On the first day of Eid al-Fitr, each family gets up at dawn, takes a bath, sweeps, and dresses neatly. Adult men wrap their heads in white cloths and gather at the place of worship, while the women take care of everything at home. People who are usually scattered in all directions have the opportunity to gather at this time, and under the leadership of the Ahong, perform large-scale worship in the square. Although there are thousands of people who have not received military training, their movements are neat and solemn, which is very spectacular, with young and old in order and without the slightest confusion. After three days, they return to their usual lives and work hard.</p>
<p>Custom of Sacrifice</p>
<p>Seventy days after "Eid al-Fitr", they joyfully welcome "Eid al-Adha". On this day, each family must sacrifice livestock. Rich people slaughter a sheep per household, and some families slaughter a cow or a camel jointly by seven families. Poor families must at least slaughter a chicken. According to custom, two-thirds of the sacrificed meat must be given to poor relatives and friends. Therefore, on this festival, almost everyone is rejoicing—this is also the meaning of Islamic love.—The remaining bones must be carefully buried underground, and not a single one is allowed to be obtained by dogs.</p>
<p>When Muslim women go out, they must cover their hair with bonnets. Young women wear green, middle-aged women wear black, and elderly women wear white. Their clothes are mostly in bright colors such as red, green, and purple. In this loess northwestern background, they look quite eye-catching.</p>
<p>Ma Family Garden in Qiazang</p>
<p>Qiazang, sixty li northwest of Linxia, ​​is the private residence of Ma Xunchen, the former chairman of Qinghai. Even in the severe winter, it can still be seen that the scenery in Qiazang in spring and summer must be very beautiful. The Ma Family Garden on the top of Qiazang Mountain has more than a thousand famous peonies. In front of the Ma family's private residence, there is a large mosque that he donated money to build alone. Hanjiaji, fifty li southwest of Linxia, ​​is the former residence of Chairman Ma Hongkui of Ningxia. The garden layout is also not small, but it looks a little desolate, probably because the owner has been away for many years and has no time to take care of it. The private Yunting School founded by Ma Hongkui in memory of his late father, Mr. Ma Yunting, is the most dynamic school in Linxia.</p>
<p>Inside and Outside Linxia City</p>
<p>The Daxia River flows around the southeast of Linxia City. The suburbs are surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the mountain terrain in the southwest is particularly steep. The city is rectangular, with no city gate on the north side. Outside the south gate is a pass called "Bafang", where Muslim shops are concentrated. West of Bafang is the Muslim residential area. North of the city is the tomb of Ming Wang Hong and the Zhaozhong Shrine. Outside the east gate is the large training ground. About a mile outside the west gate is a mountain, with the Wanshou Temple on the top of the mountain, and a pagoda standing on the top of the mountain, adding a lot of color to the scenery of Linxia. In addition, there are also the eight major Gongbei (ie, the mausoleums of great Islamic sages) such as Huasi, Bijia Field, Dagongbei, Baizhuang, Dawan Tou, Shagou, and Humen, which are also built beautifully and are very spectacular.</p>
<p>Believe Devoutly in the Only True God</p>
<p>Linxia is rich in agricultural products. Fruits, flowers, and vegetables are very abundant. In commerce, it is a market for trading with Tibetan people in the Labrang area. Daily necessities mostly rely on imports from Lanzhou.</p>
<p>The outstanding spirit of the mountains and rivers has produced many great Ahongs, great scholars, and politicians and military strategists. Under the whip of life, ordinary people live a depressed and silent life generation after generation, without rest or complaint. They sincerely believe that there is indeed a unique true God—the Creator—in the universe, and they believe that only by revering this unique true God can they obtain happiness and peace from the land.</p>
<h3>News in Brief</h3>

<h3>Gold and Silver Stabilization Committee Resolves to Accelerate the Establishment of Gold and Silver Markets</h3>
<p>Xu Kan Arrives in Shanghai to Study Methods to Suppress and Stabilize Prices</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Minister of Finance Xu Kan arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and immediately went to the second floor of the Bank of China to attend the daily meeting of the Gold and Silver Stabilization Committee held at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>It is reported that Minister Xu, after the announcement of the new financial plan, the price fluctuations have not been quelled. Together with the attendees, including Liu Gongyun, Xi Demao, Li Daonan, and Lin Chongyong, they discussed in detail and studied how to deal with the situation flexibly.</p>
<p>The meeting focused on the fact that after the opening of gold and silver, their price fluctuations have obviously become an indicator of general price increases and decreases. Therefore, they devoted all their efforts to research and discussion. In the end, it was decided to accelerate the establishment of a public gold and silver market in the city, so that the gold and silver market conditions can be brought back on track through a formal public market and under the strict supervision of the government.</p>
<p>According to a senior official attending the meeting, the establishment of a public gold and silver market has made further progress after yesterday's discussion. The government has also formally instructed all parties related to the future gold and silver market to work hard to prepare as soon as possible, and it is expected to be formally established within next week.</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Regarding the news that the establishment of a public gold and silver market is becoming increasingly popular, the reporter specifically inquired about the preparation situation from Xu Fusun, a leader in the gold industry in the city, yesterday. According to Xu, the industry has not received any instructions from the competent authorities regarding the resumption of business, so everything is still in a state of stagnation. Any preparations that the industry makes in the future must be based on official orders. Therefore, it is impossible for the industry to resume business immediately next week. In addition, the industry's original market has long been leased to others, and even if it is recovered immediately, it will take years of renovation before it can be used. Therefore, if the government urgently needs the gold industry market to resume business, it may borrow other markets for trading.</p>
<h3>After the Tightening of Silver Funds, a Relaxation is Seen: Informal Interest Rates Fall Below the Hundred Yuan Threshold</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday's silver funds showed a trend of tightening first and then loosening. At the beginning, the overnight interest rate was tight, with daily interbank lending opening at 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan, up to 120 yuan. Later, the market rumored that 3.5 billion yuan had been remitted from Taiwan, and some of it had flowed out, with one saying reaching 1 billion yuan. The tightening of silver funds was slightly eased, and the daily interbank lending rate also fell to 85 yuan and 90 yuan. After 12:30 noon, silver funds were seen to be loosening, and the daily interbank lending rate gradually fell below the 80 yuan threshold, and later even fell to 60 or 70 yuan. In the end, although there were more than 2 billion yuan in payments for cotton cloth, the tightness was not as expected, because of the outflow of remittances from other ports and the expenditure of funds from the national treasury. Therefore, the daily outflow of funds from banks was still 109.213 million yuan, the outflow of funds from the general clearing house was 89.916 million yuan, the outflow of funds from foreign banks was 9.9475 million yuan, and the inflow of funds from the small clearing house was 10.9528 million yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be payments for cotton cloth and sugar today, also reaching 2 billion yuan. However, it is heard that the authorities will still have a considerable amount of remittance positions flowing out. Therefore, the tightening and loosening of silver funds have a trend of mutual offset, and the daily interbank lending rate is expected to be maintained between 70 and 80 yuan.</p>
<p>Increase in Bounced Checks</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] After the extreme tightening of silver funds a few days ago, there were a surprisingly large number of missing documents from banks and firms during check clearing. As a result, the number of bounced checks also exceeded the unprecedented amount, with a total of 4,342 bounced checks, amounting to 2.277 billion yuan. Although the situation improved yesterday, the amount was still quite large. It is reported that the local financial authorities are closely monitoring this situation and will intensify inspections of banks and firms to determine the responsibility for the bounced checks.</p>
<p>Formation of a Pact</p>
<p>In addition, in addition to issuing a circular to all members to strictly abide by the check clearing time, the Bankers' Association has also heard that about 80 clearing banks and firms have recently formed a pact on bounced checks. According to the pact, if there is a bounced check before the clearing time, the bank or firm issuing the bounced check should first notify the bank or firm receiving the bounced check by telephone so that the receiving bank or firm can prepare additional funds to offset the amount and avoid temporary missing documents. Gold Jewelry Listed at 307,000 Yuan</p>
<h3>The Gold Market Weakens First, Then Strengthens: Festival Gold Listed at 307,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The gold market yesterday initially opened at a high of 300,500 to 310,000 yuan. Later, it was heard that the National Bank was still allocating gold to silver shops at the old price of 290,000 yuan on alternating days. Therefore, the price gradually fell to 288,000 to 290,000 yuan, with transactions as low as 270,000 yuan.</p>
<p>At noon, influenced by the loosening of silver funds, the price rebounded to 296,000 to 298,000 yuan. At around 3:15 PM, the highest market price reached 337,000 to 340,000 yuan, and the market closed at 327,000 to 330,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the National Bank yesterday allocated about 800 taels of gold to silver shops at the old price of 290,000 yuan. The listed prices in the silver shop stores remained unchanged, with gold bars still at 295,800 yuan and gold jewelry at 300,700 yuan. Business is becoming more active as the gold market rises again, and a single transaction is about 20 taels, according to someone in a large silver shop.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollars</p>
<p>The trend followed the rise and fall of gold prices. The forward market was also weak, and the backward market rose with interest in name and was flat informally. The forward market closed at 5,830 yuan and 5,880 yuan, and the backward market closed at 6,550 yuan and 6,600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Increasing Silver Dollar Minting</h3>
<p>Daily Output Increased to 150,000 Coins</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of the Central Mint, since the start of silver coin minting, the factory has minted a total of 260,000 coins, of which 150,000 coins have been transferred to the Issuing Bureau of the National Bank, awaiting issuance when needed.</p>
<p>Starting today, the factory will increase the number of silver dollar minting machines to four, and the output of silver dollars will also increase from 60,000 coins per day to 120,000 coins. After the 15th, the daily output will increase to 150,000 coins.</p>
<h3>Thousand Yuan Bills</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday, it was rumored on the market that the new version of the National Bank's thousand-yuan bills had begun to be released on the market. According to a spokesman for the bank, the new version of the thousand-yuan bills had already been announced for issuance, but so far, they have all been transported to other ports that urgently need large amounts of cash. They have not been issued in this city yet. They will consider issuing them in the future based on actual needs.</p>
<h3>Opening Market Conditions Mediocre: Chinese Stocks Improved Near Closing</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market was affected by the continuous inflow of funds from banks, and yesterday the silver funds in the market were extremely tight, with informal interest rates suddenly rising to between 1 yuan and 1.20 yuan. Under the pressure of high interest rates, the bulls were unable to bear the burden, and retail investors were especially afraid, so the sentiment in the market was strangely weak. The market situation was initially very mediocre, but then it was heard that 4 billion yuan had been remitted from Taiwan, and some of it might be released at noon, and the silver funds were easing. As a result, the sentiment slightly improved, and the market rose in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>Yong Yarn opened in the morning in the midst of tight silver funds and closed lower yesterday. When it opened in the morning, the weak trend remained. It first opened at a flat price of 4.95 yuan. Overnight short positions were covered, and the market situation slightly improved, rising to 5.025 yuan and 5.05 yuan. After the securities firms unanimously sold, it fell to 4.88 yuan and 4.91 yuan. Later, the gold price outside the ring was slightly firm, silver funds tended to ease, and informal interest rates fell back. The market rose all the way, reaching a maximum of 5.125 yuan and 5.15 yuan. After the highs, the bulls took profits, and the market once weakened, falling to 5.07 yuan and 5.10 yuan. Finally, it continued to decline, and closed at 5.05 yuan.</p>
<p>When the small and medium-sized stocks opened in the morning, they followed the trend of Yong Yarn, and the stocks opened at flat prices one after another. However, due to the emergency situation of silver funds and high informal interest rates, the bulls felt quite uninteresting, and the shorts were also quiet because of the rumors in the market and the different legends, and the overnight risk was too great. Meiya Xinguang's supply and demand were still balanced, and the market situation was still firm. Xinyihe and Jingfu's transactions were quiet, and the market situation was still soft. Xinhua Department Store's trend was uniquely beautiful due to pulling, and it rose to the limit by 1.33 yuan. The other miscellaneous stocks were mostly decadent.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Rising</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign stock market situation, due to the tightening and loosening of silver funds in the ring, all stocks saw small declines when they first opened. Later, due to the relaxation of remittances from Taiwan and the slight easing of silver funds, the sentiment became active, so the closing prices all rose.</p>
<p>Yi Yarn did 10,700 yuan, an increase of more than 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Guo Ye Company did 2,300 yuan and 2,400 yuan, an increase of more than 400 yuan compared to the previous day. Asian Shipping first showed a beautiful trend yesterday, doing 1,040 yuan and 1,060 yuan. Jardine Matheson saw a new peak again, doing 32,000 yuan and 35,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other stocks also strengthened.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Hong Kong Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank sharply again. The Shanghai telegraphic transfer rate opened at 7.2 cents per thousand yuan yesterday morning, and the closing price the day before was 7.9 cents. The gold yuan opened at 1.10 yuan per thousand yuan in the morning, and the closing price the day before was 1.175 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong gold was 305.5 yuan per Hong Kong tael, and the closing price the day before was the same price. The U.S. dollar telegraphic transfer rate was 5.222 yuan, and the closing price the day before was the same price. The U.S. dollar term bill was 5.20 yuan, and the previous day's closing price was 5.19 yuan. The U.S. dollar cash was 5.19 yuan, and the previous day's closing price was 5.18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Diesel Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Panama wheel Chinese oil tanker arrived in Shanghai from Boston yesterday, carrying more than 17,000 tons of diesel oil (bulk cargo). It is now berthed at floating buoys 31 and 32 for unloading. The oil was purchased by the power company. In addition, the China Merchants Bureau Hailie wheel transported 6,880 tons of coal from Calcutta and is expected to arrive at the port next Saturday (the 19th).</p>
<h3>Market Stroll - Spectator</h3>
<p>Is Orderly Rise a Policy? How Will Gold and Rice Prices Rise in the Future?</p>
<p>Everyone says: The financial policy currently being implemented by the authorities, as shown in the allocated gold listed price and the increase in interest rates, is a high price policy. However, it is not allowing it to rise indiscriminately, but to rise in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>Yes, order is indeed better than disorder, it is more like a system.</p>
<p>Then, without asking whether the authorities can establish control in the market, suppose they can indeed bring the anarchic market into an orderly track. Then let's calculate what the price increase in the future will be like.</p>
<p>This calculation is very easy because it is orderly. For example, the current daily interest rate for silver coins is 5 cents, which is 50 yuan per thousand yuan. Then a month's simple interest is 1,500 yuan, which is 1.5 times, and compound interest is at least 4 times the principal per month. Assuming it is calculated at doubling every half month, we can assume the trend of price increases in each month in the future.</p>
<p>For simplicity, let's take the cost of living index and the price of gold and rice as examples, and calculate them at doubling every half month. By the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, it will become the following appearance.</p>
<p>This is an orderly rise, an orderly rise, which is like this.</p>
<p>Looking at the current gold price, which is indeed more than 300,000, and the rice price, which is also more than 30,000, it is exactly equal to the cost of living index at the end of last month plus one time. Therefore, the index in the middle of this month should be at least no less than 1,286 times. However, whether it should be is one thing, and whether it is is another. What we care about is prices. By analogy with gold and rice, how can this kind of financial policy win the hearts of the people?</p>
<h3>Stable Rice Prices, Weak Recovery of Flour, Oil Market Calms then Rises</h3>
<p>The rice market stabilized yesterday. Although sellers wanted to raise prices, they lacked the strength to do so due to the severe credit crunch. The South Market opened with small quantities of 500 units, while rice shops in the Central Market increased their holdings, causing white rice to rise by 300 and thin rice by 500. In the North Market, white rice and early thin rice remained at their original prices, with special rice at 32,000 yuan. Total arrivals in the North and South Markets amounted to 5,434 stones.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil prices initially stabilized, then rose, eventually ending in a squeeze upwards. Due to the severe credit crunch, the morning market was flat, but retail buyers replenished their stocks at lower prices in the Central Market, causing the market to rise. Soybean oil closed at 127,000, up 4,000 yuan, rapeseed oil rose by 7,000, 吉桶 brand raw oil rose by 5,000, and factory-refined raw oil opened as high as 163,000 yuan. Soybean cake handling by 客帮 dealers increased, rising by 600-700 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour prices first fell then rose, due to the tight credit situation and scarce arrivals. The initial price for "Warship" brand flour was 12,000 yuan, down 300 yuan. Subsequently, due to the low opening price, retail buyers replenished their stocks at the lower prices, causing prices to rise. Near closing, the tight credit situation eased slightly, and prices rose sharply by 300 yuan, closing at 12,580 yuan. "Old Car" brand closed at 13,050 yuan, up 200 yuan. Bran rose by 350 yuan.</p>
<p>Various Grains mostly rose in price, due to scarce arrivals, and sellers strongly resisted price drops. However, soybeans declined due to the weakness of oilseed cake, leading to a price pullback later in the market. Hankou car soybeans fell below the 27,000 mark. 乍 soybeans were quoted at 24,000 yuan, 生仁徽秀 at 5,000 yuan. Corn was vigorously bought by 青帮, causing a sharp increase of over 1,000 yuan. Red sorghum followed suit, with selected green rising by 2,000.</p>
<h3>Sugar Dump Sale</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation yesterday sold a batch of special-grade white sugar (200斤 per bag) on behalf of the Central Bank, still using a quotation allocation system. As a result, a total of 8,440 bags were sold at a price of 40,000 yuan per dan, plus a donation tax of 11%, with a total value of 67.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Downturn Yesterday's tung oil market initially showed weakness in the morning due to the softness of foreign exchange transfer certificates. The trend then turned even weaker due to the continued tight credit situation. It was reported that market interest rates were high, and most operators could not bear the heavy interest burden, frequently offering to sell, causing the bottom to become unsustainable and rapidly decline. Although financing conditions eased slightly later, market sentiment did not improve. At the close, green oil fell sharply by 20,000 yuan, and fully-graded white oil also fell by 5,000 yuan. As for 正副各脾西洪, the decline was slower due to the stagnant supply, estimated to be around 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Stable Tea Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to tea industry authorities speaking to our reporter: Although the pressure of the credit squeeze has also affected tea merchants in the past two days, due to the scarcity of tea reserves and the doubling of railway freight rates, which has significantly impacted costs, holders of goods are continuing to struggle. As a result, the trend has stabilized after a brief respite. Prices remain high, but buyers are reluctant to act due to the difficulty in getting what they want and high implicit interest rates, leading to hesitation and limited transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk Market: Weak Early, Strong Later</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the raw silk market experienced tight credit conditions, making turnover difficult and raising implicit interest rates to over one yuan. Holders were eager to sell, leading to a flat and weak market.</p>
<p>No. 120 東洋 opened at 1.4 million in the morning. After opening, sales offers continued, causing prices to soften, with a low quote of 1.38 million. After the drop, demand was sluggish and sentiment was weak, causing the market to hover at the low end. Later, as market credit conditions eased slightly, demand increased slightly, and the closing price for same-day financing was 1.4 million. The closing price for next-day financing was 1.6 million. In the afternoon, credit conditions eased slightly, gold prices rose, and sentiment improved greatly, leading to further price increases.</p>
<p>Raw silk's foreign exchange certificates showed a very strong trend at the morning opening, and sentiment was still good. However, due to extremely tight credit conditions and the heavy interest burden on holders, the desire to sell remained strong. Superior grades initially traded at 2.1 million, hovering without clear direction. Near noon, news that Taiwan remittances were partially opened eased credit conditions, lowered market interest rates, and turned holders from sellers to buyers, causing the market to rise. The final quote was 2.16 million. In the afternoon, the trend was stable, and quotes continued to be strong due to a slight rise in gold prices, which stabilized sentiment, but there were no formal transactions.</p>
<p>Silk fabrics initially experienced weak market sentiment due to tight credit conditions and sluggish demand from all parties. 美亞 opened in the morning at 925,000 yuan, falling to a low of 1 million yuan at one point. Near noon, news of improved Chinese stocks and easing credit conditions improved sentiment, leading to a high of 985,000 yuan at one point. It finally closed at 975,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Industry Association Requests Approval to Ban Waste Silk Imports</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to the Technology Committee of the Municipal Industry Association: Waste silk is the main raw material for domestic silk products. Before the war, domestic production could reach more than 100,000 dan per year. After the victory, annual production dropped sharply to 31,000 dan, while foreign merchants were still competing to export this waste silk, resulting in a significant gap between supply and demand for raw materials for the silk industry, which has deeply affected production. The Industry Association has now sent letters to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Export Control Committee, requesting approval to import this waste silk and strictly prohibit the export of this domestic raw material to facilitate production.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Recovers Near Close, Cloth Market Trend Hovering</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn started flat and ended strong. At the initial opening, due to widespread tight credit conditions, no parties showed any buying interest. Later, as market credit conditions eased, retail buyers and operators took advantage of lower prices to absorb supply, causing prices to rise steadily. Until the close, many floaters slightly disposed of goods, and the final prices showed a slight pullback.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 2.06 million yuan to a high of 2.33 million yuan, closing at 2.29 million yuan, a squeeze up of 230,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix also rose by 220,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon rose from 1.37 million yuan to 1.51 million yuan, ending with a strong increase of 140,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot opened in the morning at 1.08 million yuan and closed at 1.15 million yuan, an increase of 125,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The last price for factory orders was 1.145 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse broke through the million mark again, closing at 1.08 million yuan. Other brands, such as 天女 and 金城, were traded at prices ranging from 1.05 million yuan to 1.1 million yuan. 16-count Guangming also approached 1 million yuan. All other yarns also showed a strong trend.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth initially showed an increasing trend of tight credit conditions in the morning. There were many operators in need of orders, and the Taiwan and Guangdong groups were also forced to prioritize selling goods for cash due to financing pressures. Towards the close, due to the rise in cotton yarn prices, the market began to show signs of recovery.</p>
<p>The opening price for Dragon Head fine cloth was 39,000 yuan, and 四君子 Yuan Biji was 37,500 yuan. After hovering for a long time, the market turned slightly stronger as credit conditions eased somewhat, and short sellers frantically covered their positions. The closing prices were 41,500 yuan for the former, a squeeze up of 800 yuan, and 40,500 yuan for the latter, also up 800 yuan. Trumpet Child and Silver Moon fine cloth declined. 四君子 Yuan Zhigong finally stood at the 40,000 yuan mark, up 500 yuan. For colored cloth, patterned cloth, and 府綢, factories mostly opened with the same prices as the previous day, but transactions were few. In the afternoon, buying interest outside the market increased, with rumors that Dragon Head was quoted as high as 46,500 yuan and Biji at 45,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Tonight's Basketball League:</h3>
<p>Hua Lian Re-Encounters Hai Qing, Women's Division: Xinghua vs. Li Team</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Tonight's key game in the First Division of the basketball league is Hua Lian against Hai Qing. Hua Lian won decisively in the first round, and victory should be certain this time. Although Hua Lian had a surprising loss last week, losing to Pei Feier by one point, it was entirely due to unexpected fatigue. Hai Qing's recent performance has improved, and their three black players are particularly fierce, which may pose a threat to Hua Lian. However, it will not be easy for the American team to shake Hua Lian. Before the game, the women's division will feature Xinghua against the Li team, also a second-round match. The game starts at 5:30 PM, and ticket prices remain the same. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Xinghua vs. Li Team (Women's Division) 5:30 PM Referees: Wen Zongyuan, Yu Julu</p>
<p>Post and Telecommunications vs. Hezhong (Second Division B) 6:15 PM Referees: Wang Yiqiao, Wang Lidu</p>
<p>Hua Lian vs. Hai Qing (First Division) 7:15 PM Referees: Jin Botao, Jiang Yinseng</p>
<p>The women's division will kick off with Xinghua facing the Li team again. Xinghua boasts star players such as Wang Huiling, Wang Shan, and Zhu Jiazhen. However, Wang Huiling was unable to play in the first round due to personal matters, which somewhat affected their strength. Fortunately, the team has a lot of talent, and in addition to Wang and Zhu, Qian Mengyue, Yao Siyuan, and newcomers Xu Xiuyun and Wang Zelen are all good players who have high hopes in the women's division. They won two and lost one in their first three matches, which was not weak, but after forfeiting against the Green team, their ranking fell behind the Li team. The Li team lacks experience and has weaker fighting ability, resulting in repeated defeats. However, the team has excellent spirit and never gives up. They were defeated 17-42 by Xinghua in the first round. This time, although they may not be able to avenge their defeat, they may be able to pose a considerable threat to Xinghua by going all out.</p>
<p>Following the women's game is the Second Division B match between Post and Telecommunications and Hezhong. Post and Telecommunications is the Liangxi champion team and has ambitious goals for participating in this league. Unfortunately, they lost their first game against the Police Machinery team due to unfamiliarity with the lighting at the venue. They will give an excellent performance today. Although Hezhong is not a ragtag team, they have lost both of their two matches in this division, resulting in an average performance. However, after repeated setbacks, they are also seeking to improve and strengthen. When the two defeated armies meet, they will both aim to excel, and the resulting tension and intensity are self-evident.</p>
<p>The final game of the night is the First Division match between Hua Lian and the 番 army, Hai Qing. In the first round, Hua Lian won decisively with a score of 63-47. Hai Qing has had eight matches, with six losses and two wins, only slightly better than the MacLeans. However, the team has a lot of potential, such as the three black players Robinson, Parks, and others, who are quite skilled. Pannock, Bornho also show prowess. However, due to deep-seated racial prejudices and discrimination against black players, internal unity is weak, which has been exploited by other teams. If they can work together, they will be difficult to deal with. Hua Lian is the leader of the league and the strength of all its members need not be stated. They won all seven of their first round matches and were invincible. However, in the first game of the second round last weekend, they suffered a surprising loss to Pei Feier by one point. Today, they will face Hai Qing again, and learning from past mistakes, they will proceed with caution and inflict a painful blow on the enemy. The rosters of the six teams are listed below:</p>
<p>(Xinghua) Wang Huiling, Wang Shan, Zhu Jiazhen, Zhu Lanzhen, Wu Zhaorui, Huang Ruyu, Jian Zhiguang, Zhu Zelen, Qian Mengyue, Wang Wenlian, Yao Siyuan, Xu Xiuyun.</p>
<p>(Li Team) Weng Xiayun, Wang Jiahua, Liang Miaoling, Yao Wenda, Liang Miaozhen, Fan Yuying, Chen Shanbao, Liu Danzai, Zhang Shanfu, Zhou Younan.</p>
<p>(Post and Telecommunications) Wang Chunyuan, Yu Yao, Li Fangzhen, Lü Qingbao, Wu Jinwen, Tang Minsheng, Gao Baosheng, Dai Yaozhang.</p>
<p>(Hezhong) Tai Yuanchong, Li Jiazhi, Jiang Sibao, Li Zhenbang, Li Peidong, Zhang Youwei, Dong Shaotang, Hua Jingshi.</p>
<p>(Hua Lian) Ren Xiangcheng, Li Zhenzhong, Wu Chengzhang, Le Jiazhou, Fu Jinsheng, Bao Songyuan, Liu Fushan, Li Hanting, Zhang Liangxiong.</p>
<p>(Hai Qing) Gibson, Pannock, Bornho, Keckle, Robinson, Parks, 沙亞, Qin Sen, 梅氏海列克, Halai'er.</p>
<h3>Danish Tennis Comet Repeatedly Defeats Famous Players in Europe and America</h3>
<p>(Associated Press, Copenhagen) A young man has recently emerged in the European tennis world who is good at defeating giants. He is an eighteen-year-old Danish student named Gotnirsen. This winter, he quickly defeated the American top players Parker and Burch Betty, Hungary's Aspoff, Sweden's Johansson, and Czech Republic's Sonnick. Cha, Hungary's Aspifu, was among the final four in the Wimbledon singles championship in 1918, and is the second-best player in the European tennis world, the first being Czech Republic's Drobney. Johansson is the second-best player in Sweden, and Sonnick is also the second-best player in Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Because of this miracle, he has won the Scandinavian (Northern European Peninsula, including Norway and Sweden) indoor tennis singles championship. He now plans to use this as a springboard to further his studies in the West and is determined to show his skills at Wimbledon and Linshan.</p>
<p>The fact that he entered the tennis world is something that even fictional novelists may not be able to describe. He is a tall, jade-faced man with a natural talent for playing ball. His father is a merchant in Copenhagen and also used to play football. Got inherited his father's qualities and became a star in the Danish B-team football team at a young age. However, his passion for tennis was greater than for football. Six years ago, he found an old tennis racket in his toolkit and used a rope to tie one end to a tree trunk and the other end to a lamppost and started practicing tennis. After winning the Danish tennis singles championship, he tried his hand in Europe last year and was successfully selected as Denmark's first singles representative for the 台盃. It was a small surprise that Denmark was able to enter the third week of the European zone in the 台盃. However, he participated in the Wimbledon Championships later, but due to lack of experience, he was stage-frightened and lost to England's Motolin, so he did not attract much attention. His first miracle was created in 1948, when he surprisingly defeated the American singles champion Parker, which was the first stage of his rapid rise.</p>
<p>Gotnirsen will be nineteen years old in November this year. His current hope is to study at the University of California in the United States because he believes that California is the only place to truly learn to play good tennis. He is also interested in philosophy and jazz music. Every time he goes out to play tennis, he always brings back many phonograph records to his country in addition to prizes, so the United States is indeed the most ideal place for him to go.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven countries participating in this year's Davis Cup tennis tournament held a draw at the United Nations office in New York, hosted by United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie. The second person from the right in the picture is Trygve Lie, and to his right is Lawrence, the president of the United States Lawn Tennis Association.

<h3>Olympic Women's Champion (2)</h3>
<p>The Biography of Mrs. Koen, the Flying General of the Netherlands</p>
<p>—Translated by Ding Xin</p>
<p>British newspapers said she was too old and could never win the women's 80-meter hurdles championship, but she overwhelmed the 19-year-old British girl, Kettner. (The one to her left in the picture)</p>
<p>Speaking of Fanny, the two old men scrambled to recount her mischievous childhood. "Because of her fast legs, Fanny was always joking with her neighbors. She especially liked to steal people's apples and ring their doorbells. The neighbors were always shouting: 'Don't think you can escape fast, if I catch you, I'll break your neck!' Don't look at Fanny now that she's grown up, hum, she still often rings doorbells and jokes with others! It's hard to change one's nature!"</p>
<p>Fanny Koen made her official debut on the track in August 1935. She participated in the women's 200-meter race for the first time, but not only did she not achieve anything, she almost fell. But a month later, she surprisingly surpassed the then Dutch women's long-distance champion, 卡蘭娜絲, in the 800-meter race. At that time, Jane was 卡蘭娜絲's coach and also the almost-recognized 总导 of the 世运 delegation. After the game, Jane said: "I was cheering for 卡蘭娜絲 during the game, and I was convinced that 卡蘭娜絲 would win, because Fanny's specialty is the high jump. Her running posture was really ugly at the time, and her feet seemed to be dragging on the ground for the first six hundred yards, but who would have expected that at the last moment, when 卡蘭娜絲's strength was not enough, Koen would dart out from behind like an arrow. I determined at the time that she could definitely be made in sprinting."</p>
<p>Soon after, due to Jane's appreciation, Fanny was selected into the 世运 delegation. Because sprinting requires at least one year of training, Jane persuaded her to temporarily abandon the trail and focus on the field. But the trip to Berlin was still quite a failure. Fanny only jumped to five feet one inch, and was tied for sixth with Australia's Card and the United States' Rogers. Her own results were not as good as her usual practice.</p>
<p>After returning to the Netherlands, Jane devoted himself to coaching this seventeen-year-old blonde girl. Jane told her to switch to sprinting. Under his day-and-night influence, Fanny underwent a 180-degree transformation; from a clumsy and slow "country girl"—as the fashionable city sports girls called her at the time—to a streamlined vanguard with strong elasticity and impact. Within a year, she won all the sprint events at the Dutch Games; she also won two championships in Germany.</p>
<p>At the European Games held in Vienna in 1938, Fanny ran the 100 meters in 12 seconds, finishing third. The results were already very good, but the ambitious coach was not satisfied.</p>
<p>After that, Jane devoted himself to making Fanny a versatile athlete, practicing long jump in addition to sprinting and high jump. In 1940, he went a step further, asking Fanny to run and jump—hurdles.</p>
<p>At this time, the passion hidden in the hearts of the teacher and student finally melted their superficial Dutch indifference and began to make further contacts. The scope of the conversation was no longer limited to discussing the correct posture of arm movement and the center of gravity of sprinting, etc.</p>
<p>In August 1940, 瓜香蒂熟, Miss Fanny Koen was officially named Mrs. Jane Blankers.</p>
<p>The Nazi invasion caused Jane to join the army. But he soon returned to 荷京 and became a police sports instructor. In addition to guiding the police to compete in track and field, Jane also taught them Japanese-style self-defense martial arts, Judo. Poor Fanny often had to be grabbed like a chick and thrown around like a ball by him in the middle of the night because Jane wanted to practice Judo moves himself. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Listening to the Kunlun Evening Show</h3>
<p>— Wang Ce</p>
<p>From 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM on the 6th, some of the main actors of the Kunlun Film Company, such as Lan Ma, Huang Chen, Wu Yin, Huang Zongying, and Shangguan Yunzhu, held the second Kunlun Evening Show at the China Free Radio Station. In this evening show, the distance between the film and stage actors and the audience was brought closer. To quote a line from "Lights of Ten Thousand Homes," the actors and the audience were able to "get closer together." Therefore, after listening to the wonderful programs by the radio, I also want to write down some of my own opinions.</p>
<p>First, this radio evening show was obviously paving the way for Kunlun's new film—"Hope in the World," the new work of 沈浮 after "Lights of Ten Thousand Homes." In other words, Kunlun wanted to use this evening show to do more publicity work for "Hope in the World." Although the intention was good, the time spent introducing "Hope in the World" in the entire program was too long. For example, Wu Yin's introduction of the story could just briefly state the theme of the story and emphasize the most prominent parts of the film. This would be easier for listeners to accept, and the time spent could also be shortened.</p>
<p>Second, when introducing the list of actors and announcers, for those who are not very familiar to the listeners, it is recommended to specifically introduce the spelling of their names so that, in addition to a few familiar stars, Kunlun's new faces can also get closer to the listeners.</p>
<p>The entire program can be said to be quite wonderful.</p>
<p>Shangguan Yunzhu's "Words of Film and Theater People" is "ideologically correct." She said that she used to have beautiful star dreams, but now she has awakened from this dream. She said that although she had made seven or eight films after the victory, her courage became smaller and smaller. She also said that the spirit of struggle of her friends gave her a great inspiration, and in the future, she will pay attention to how to choose scripts when making films.</p>
<p>Those who dream of becoming stars can listen to this "confession."</p>
<p>The "Recitation Poem" was performed by Lan Ma, and the title was "Reading by a Slave," which is a short poem published in the literary section of a newspaper.</p>
<p>Huang Chen answered the "Film and Theater Q&amp;A." Wu Yin introduced the detailed story of the new film "Hope in the World."</p>
<p>The actors of "Hope in the World" are also all the actors of "Lights of Ten Thousand Homes," but they have all changed their styles and played completely opposite characters.</p>
<p>There are three one-act plays in total: "The Little Match Girl," "Turning Trouble into Nothing," and "Seeking Immortality," all of which are cold and sharp portrayals of real society.</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM on the 20th of this month, they will hold the third evening show at the original radio station, and I hope they can bring more wonderful programs to the listeners. In this world of radio, where there is a sea of low-level, decadent music and slick sales pitches, it is really not easy to listen to something worthwhile.</p>
<h3>Fish</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>My residence is located on the banks of the Pu River. Leaning on the window, I can see many fishing boats drifting on the water. Because of frequent exposure, I can't help but develop an interest in matters concerning fish.</p>
<p>"Fish have no nationality. If we don't catch them, they will swim into the nets of other countries." This is one of the reasons why our country began to pay attention to "fishing."</p>
<p>When the Fisheries Administration first took over from the Americans, there was a joke:</p>
<p>When it was time for yellow croaker to be on the market, the captains were ordered to lead their fishing boats out to sea to catch them. But the result was that they could not find any trace of yellow croaker. The captains had no choice but to return empty-handed. This infuriated the director, who ordered a second departure, saying, "Yellow croaker must exist, they must be in the sea." So, the fishing boats searched the sea again, but how could they find them in the vast ocean? In the end, most of the fishing boats still gained nothing, with only one boat catching a small amount. At this moment, a fishing boat returning from Qingdao on official business unintentionally encountered a school of yellow croaker on the way back. Unfortunately, limited by the fishing nets, they could only watch them go north after trying their best to catch them.</p>
<p>Thus, the truth became clear: this was really because the Chinese had just taken over and were not familiar with the location of the fishing grounds.</p>
<p>The ocean is so vast that if you are not clear about the habitat and habits of various fish, it is simply impossible to start.</p>
<p>For example, small yellow croaker are not the offspring of large yellow croaker. They like to go to the Zhoushan Islands, so that area has become a good fishing ground. Also, although shad develop in seawater, they especially like to come to the Yangtze River when they grow up. They lay their eggs there, along Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Hankou and even Yiwu, after marrying there. Therefore, to catch shad, you must come to the Yangtze River. Knowing these things makes fishing much easier.</p>
<p>In addition, the food of fish should also be noted. Generally, people say that big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp, and big shrimp eat small shrimp. But what do small shrimp eat? If we know what they eat, and we find it in a place, there must be traces of fish. Now we know that their ultimate food is algae in the sea. Facts have proven that places with algae often have fish and shrimp together. However, we worry that the algae may one day be eaten up. Therefore, it is very necessary to put fertilizer in the sea. But in China, people are reluctant to fertilize even terrestrial plants, let alone the flowing seawater! In fact, fishing requires international cooperation. For example, there is a type of fish whose growing habits are: young in China, slightly older in Japan, and grown in the Philippines. We can catch small fish, but there is a limit. If we catch them all in one net, Japan will have no medium-sized fish, and the Philippines will have no large fish. But what about China next year? The problem lies here. This is not like raising chickens and ducks on land, where you know the exact number and they are always in your own yard.</p>
<p>The aquatic realm is several times larger than the terrestrial realm, and the exploitable depth is countless times greater. This is truly a treasure. If we are good at using it, human life can certainly be improved much more than it is now.</p>
<h3>Somnambulism</h3>
<p>— Ding Yi</p>
<p>People suffering from somnambulism often rise suddenly in their sleep, able to work, walk, and even travel away from home as they do on weekdays. After an episode, the patient can still sleep soundly as usual, and does not know what he has just done after waking up.</p>
<p>Although there are no statistics on the number of people in our country suffering from this disease, it must be considerable. The following is a report and statistics from the United States on this disease.</p>
<p>According to a survey, there are two million people in the United States who have suffered from somnambulism, and patients can also read, write letters, do work, take trains and cars, or even drive cars. Although science is as developed as in the United States, and much of the mystery of sleep has been uncovered, the cause of somnambulism remains unexplained. However, one thing is clear: the somnambulist's body is controlled by his subconscious mind, which is the hiding place of our daily hopes, fears, and difficulties. Once somnambulism occurs, the patient's latent desires are revealed in action.</p>
<p>Somnambulists also often have a stealing mania, often taking the wallets of their roommates while sleepwalking.</p>
<p>Because the subconscious mind usually occupies only a small part of intelligence and is controlled by rational thought, it is not easy to attack on weekdays.</p>
<p>A famous American novelist also suffered from this disease. One night he woke up and found himself sitting on a windowsill—in a room several floors above the ground. So, for safety's sake, he locked both his feet the next night and hid the key under the carpet. Despite such thorough protection, he woke up at midnight to find himself still sitting on the windowsill. Afterwards, he used all his skills to hide the key every night, but the result was still the same, showing that he could still use his intelligence and memory while sleepwalking.</p>
<p>A British medical journal reported a news story about a woman who could get out of bed while sound asleep and write letters and knit the finest things in almost complete darkness. But when the doctor woke her up and asked her to do it again, she couldn't.</p>
<p>Ordinary somnambulists often have an attack two hours after falling asleep—that is, when sleep enters its sweetest state. The duration of somnambulism varies from person to person, possibly lasting several minutes or several hours, and it is said even several months. Somnambulists may travel far away to live, or even start a family and career there.</p>
<p>Although there is no fixed method for treating this disease, because it belongs to the aspect of psychological morbidity, doctors must explore its underlying factors, and then try to remove its cause. Of course, when science becomes more developed in the future, there may be faster and more effective treatments invented.</p>
<h3>Strange Laws</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Michigan in the United States has formulated such a law: "An old maid, a widow, and a prudent woman peering at a man from under the bed is not sufficient evidence of mental disorder."</p>
<p>A judge in New Hampshire ruled: "A woman, even if she is certain that her husband has lice, must not put DDT or other insecticides in his food."</p>
<p>A court in Alabama has enacted such a law: "It is perfectly legal for a husband to beat his disobedient wife with a cane. However, the thickness of the cane cannot exceed the diameter of her wedding ring."</p>
<p>A judge in Tennessee once ruled: "A husband has no right to kick his wife out of bed, even if her feet are cold. On the other hand, the wife has the right to kick her spouse out of bed at any time she chooses, and does not need to state her reasons for kicking him."</p>
<p>A New York court ruled: "It is not illegal for a moviegoer to turn around in a theater and hiss contemptuously at two women behind him who are loudly discussing the plot, because this is within his rights."</p>
<p>The New York court once again ruled in its judgment statement, "When something is known by a woman, there is no secret."</p>
<h3>Curious Facts about Animals</h3>
<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>The strangest insect in the world is called the Artulit worm. After a certain period of time, it can turn into a plant. This is because it has a fungus growing on it. When it grows to six or eight inches tall, the Artulit worm dies, and the worm-shaped corpse relies on the soil to grow.</p>
<p>The electric eel produced in South America is the leader among the world's electricity-generating fish. It is eight feet long, and 80 percent of the muscles in its body are composed of electric cells, which can continuously emit 600 volts of electricity, or 200 units of light.</p>
<p>There is a strange snake in West Africa, called the ball python, with beautiful patterns on its body. It shrinks into a ball, like a piece of flowered stone. Because it is small and does not bite, children often play with it.</p>
<p>Yesterday's intelligence quiz answer: Just go to bed during the day.</p>
<h3>Expressing My Feelings with Fifty Poems, Following the Original Rhyme of遊天兄</h3>
<p>A man of lofty ideals should not pity himself, but pour out the pine wine and get drunk before the flowers. Isn't it a blessing to live in leisure and be proud? Exploring the source of ancient interest is another world. Singing opens the clouds and reveals the moon for thousands of miles, reciting behind the curtains holds a trace of smoke. Knowing that you have been thirsty like Sima Xiangru recently, you have been playing strings in Wenyuan every night for a long time.</p>
<h3>Expressing My Feelings with the Previous Rhyme</h3>
<p>An unyielding spirit doesn't need pity, and the ambition remains as before over the years. The vicissitudes of life are difficult to predict, and I listen to fate while forgetting the machine with poetry and wine. One song ends and sadness flows away like water, a thousand gold are scattered and I laugh at the flying smoke. Across the river, the sound of war drums is urgent, and I play strings in the windy and rainy building myself.</p>
