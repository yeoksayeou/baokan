<h3>留平五日數晤葉劍英等　京肛表團返抵首都　中共對和談態度及條件業已獲知　今謁李代總統報吿經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕京人民和平代表團邱致中，吳裕後，會資生等一行，赴平與中共在平領袖枼劍英，林彪，聶榮臻等晤談，交換和平問題意見，先後在平停留五日，已於十一日下午五時自平乘專機飛返京。邱·吳等在平會數次訪晤葉劍英，林彪，聶榮臻等，一面探詢中共對和平問題之意見及和談進行之技術，一面以第三者身份轉告目前政府對和平之意願及對和談準備情形，現已搜集若干資料，並已獲知中共對和談所持之熊度及中共對政府所要求應切實實行之條件。定十二日晋謁李代總統報告，將中共之意見轉達政府，俟獲得政府之反應後，可望將內容發表。據該團某代表談，渠等與葉·林等晤談結果，葉·林等均表示中共亦願意和平，惟須經過一番準備，至少須在北平完全解放以後，至北平何時始謂完全解放’現北平正從事調查戶口工作，以策安全，完全解放之定義雖無明確解說，但以時問計之，一個月內約可完成，屆時中共當可望派出代表，進行和談·葉·林等諸中共領袖對蔣總統及率代總統個人之看法，雖微有不同，但並無甚多軒輊，渠等對李代總統之和平誠意，仍持慎重之觀望熊度，希望主持和談者能代表整個政府，且具有充分之控制力量者。代表團等會擬於十一日訪晤傳作義，以十一日匆匆返京，故未及與傳晤見，代表團在平活動尙屬自由，惟爲慎重計，中共與代表團商定對於往訪之中外記者均概不接見。又隨代表團赴平之記者六人，以未獲中共允許，抵西苑機塲後，未能入城，在機塲內留住五日，十一日仍隨代表團原機返京。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十一日廣播：今日陝北中共電合廣播時，對南京人民和平代表團邱致中等一行在平洽談和平一事，亦會公開提及，並謂，任務業已「順利完成」·又稱：該團臨行前，會將商談經過發表一書面談話，對葉劍英將軍及中共在北平當局之熟烈招待，表示感謝。該廣播中指出，南京代表團會與葉劍英將軍等先後會談兩次，第二次談話，談了四點多鐘，又謂，葉劍英已允將該代表團意見代爲轉達中共中央。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十一日電〕京人民和平代表團十一日飛返此間，與北平中共領袖會談結束，「頗感激勵」。據透露關於共方要求整編軍隊與懲辦戰犯等已獲進展。傅作義並未被捕。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海和平代表團赴平之事，一波三折。甘介侯前日深夜十二時又接獲北平長途電話，請轉告代表團延期至十三日飛平。甘氏遂於昨晨八時通知顏惠慶轉告各團員，昨日赴平之舉又作罷論。據有資格人士之觀察，認爲最近國際情勢已有轉變，美方東京會議決定援華，國內和談局面之形成，遠不如樂觀人士之預期，在此氣氛之下，代表團飛平之一再延期，乃當然之事，即使顏惠慶等明日又不能成行，亦不足驚異。</p>
<h3>李代癖統孫院長對大局意見一致</h3>
<p>〔合衆社廣州十一日電〕高級政府方面十一日稱：李代總統及其他高級官員業已與孫院長意見一致，卽中共不要和平，不致早日開始終止內戰之談判，唯一可循之途徑，將爲準備最後決戰。該方又稱：李代總統諒即將來廣州，蓋和平希望已崩潰，李代總統來穗，乃與孫院長及內閣合作開始最後之準備。但李總統諒仍留駐南京若干時日，作爲政府願意談和之微象。同時政府將趕緊防止共軍春季渡江攻勢之準備，並希望此一行動可能使共方條件軟化。該方又稱：附有廣泛監督權利之美國援助，可能再度獲得，此項美援將包括軍事及經濟性者。政府已在着手一稅收改革計劃，作爲提出此項要求時之根據，政府主要之努力，將着重於華南之團結，防止諸如北平少局部和平解決。又訊：監察院長于右任及立法院長童冠賢，將於十一日赴滬，勸告該兩院委員來穗履任。孫科及其他官員會公開及秘密地否認粵·桂兩省間之疑義乃政府意見分歧之原因，但彼等承認關於政府移穗一事，會意見分歧。</p>
<h3>廣州各局長安步當車</h3>
<p>因汽車已被征用</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十一日電〕自各部院陸續南遷後，此間汽車大感不敷，市府自歐陽市長以下，各局長之公家汽車幾全被征用，使局長們均安步當車，亦爲政府南遷中之小景。</p>
<h3>賴樸翰月中返美</h3>
<p>經合首批肥料運抵我國</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十一日電〕賴樸輸表示，此次來穗係向孫院長辭行，氏奉命於十六日以前返美，向國會報告在華經濟合作情形，並順道視察此間分處工作及與中國農業復興委會聯絡，至外傳賴氏將在穗與孫院長等舉行會議，商討美援事，氏未予承認。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十一日電〕政院美援物資運用委會暨經濟合作分署昨聯席會議中，行政院長孫科表示希望能獲美政府更廣泛之援助。賴樸輸對實際上已成爲中國新政治重心之粵穗尤深注意。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕經合署肥料第一批業已運抵中國，硫酸錏九百公噸本日已由「阿格文」號輸自加拿大運抵上海。美援肥料將經由中國農民銀行分配予中國農民。</p>
<h3>下屆立法院會將在南京舉行</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十一日電〕根據合衆社調查：此間有資格方面之意見，顯示孫科堅持在廣州設立其內閣，可能付出其職位之代價。根據此一調查之透露稱：當立法院召開下屆全體大會時，對孫院長之日甚一日之譴責，可能成爲一有組織之運動。有資格之立法院方面稱：下屆立法院會議將在南京舉行，不致在廣州舉行。一般認爲：五法院會議在南京召開之決議，無疑地將爲對孫院長政治地位之嚴重打擊·該方面又稱：雖則立法院秘書處已移穗及在穗立法委員要求在華南城市舉行會議，然大部份立委贊成留在南京。彼等又稱：現留在京·滬區之立委，首先決定立院留京，並已獲得在漢口·桂林等三地之立委之支持·傳上海立委已派遺代表赴台灣，以獲取該地立委之支持。同時：高級地位方面人士堅持李代總統與孫院長同對行政院南遷一事，並無意見八歧。該人士又稱：李代總統會勸告孫科內閣留京，李氏對最近立法會議地址之爭執，亦不予過問。</p>
<h3>總統府人員　限月中前至穗</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十一日電〕據悉：總統府主要部份文件已運抵穗，其餘亦陸續在啓運途中，該府人員限於本月十五日前來穗報到。</p>
<h3>定期開中全會說鄭彥棻鄭重否認</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十一日電〕日來港粵若干報紙，載有國民黨將定期三月廿九日在穗召開中央委員全體會議之訊，頃據中央黨部秘書長鄭彥棻鄭重對記者宣稱，中央黨部離京前及遷穗後，迭次中央常會對召開中全會問題，迄未加考慮，更無定期舉行之事，報載定期舉行全會一節，絕非事實。</p>
<h3>程思遠返京</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕立委程思遠氏，自台返滬後，十一日晚乘車晋京。</p>
<h3>國軍馳援宜昌　漢宜間情況轉穩電訊恢復　渝滬航綫仍暢通無阻</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十一日電〕劉參謀長十一日上午十時接前綫長途電話：（一）侵犯宜昌共軍，今晨擊退，刻共軍竄抵距宜四十餘里，國軍第六十師己馳宜增授。（二）孫震刻在三斗坪。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十一日電〕據悉：宜昌軍用電話一度阻塞，十一日以情况轉穩，業已恢復正常。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十一日電〕最近荊門之役，該縣縣長鄒樹聲因率部突圍，不幸負傷殉職。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十一日電〕宜昌秩序仍未恢復，宜民生公司機器廠十日深夜遭搶刦三小時，損失嚴重，泊平善壩黃陵廟三斗坪船舶因無法控制散兵强迫登輸及用煤缺乏，今仍未西上。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十一日電〕武漢記者前綫訪問團一行十四人，十一日晨出發豫南防地視察。</p>
<p>〔本報豫鄂邊境橫店十一日電〕記者今與武漢記者前綫視察團同抵某地，當即訪問華中堡壘之張淦將軍及其所部健兒·張氏於茶話會上宣稱：盤據郾城一帶之劉伯承部一·六·四·三個縱隊，除四縱隊一部外，大部皆已向北竄去，其在新蔡以西之二·三·六。一二個縱隊，亦已先後向西北移動，刻本兵團所屬各部正廣泛佈防豫鄂境內，相機作戰略準備，短期內共軍決無力南犯，即使冒險，深信必能保土衛民云。七時許，張氏復邀記者參加晚會，軍民一體同歡，情緒至爲熱烈</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口十一日電〕長江渝滬航綫現仍暢通無阻，招商局之江漢輪，四日由漢駛滬，九日安全抵達。該局之江和·江順·江泰·及三北公司鴻貞·鴻亨·怡太公司之大達等輪，均由滬駛漢，刻已過安慶，日內卽可到達。又，民生公司之民族輪，昨過宜昌西上，民貴輸今泊沙市，航行均極安全。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十一日電〕十一日悉：大批共軍在河南北部渡過黃河南下，向長江前綫進展。如此項消息屬實，則與長江北岸戰事的繼續沉寂，適成尖說的對照。觀察家認爲：（一）中共將堅持其和平條件，同時準備在和談失敗時，以更多的兵力渡江南攻；（二）此項新的軍力，可能用以增援自長江北岸前綫後撤整補的共軍，（三）繼續對漢口發動神經戰，因白崇禧將軍已訓令其部屬充份備戰，以迎擊可能來到的攻勢。觀察家認爲：此項新的軍力可能係自被圍的山西省城太原附近調來，該地的壓力顯已減輕。</p>
<h3>徐堪等視察黃埔</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州十一日電〕財長徐堪，中央銀行總裁劉攻芸，昨偕粵海關稅務司方度及經濟工程專家十餘人，赴黃埔視察，對開埠工程及今後建設多所規劃。</p>

<p>〔本報蘭州十一日電〕西北長官署發言人，昨深夜以電話發布張治中氏決電中樞懇辭和談代表任務，僉認曩熱心奔走和平之張氏突表消極，益使時局混沌。</p>
<p>〔中央社闌州十一日電〕張治中將軍以西北軍政長官公署諸事待理，且新疆亦咸盼張將軍前往一行，聞已電請中央懇辭和談代表任務。李代總統日前派來迎接張氏之專機自强號，業於昨日返京，張氏俟此間要務料理後，或將赴新一行。</p>
<p>西北長官公署否認反和主戰</p>
<p>〔本報闌州十日電〕西北長官公署發言人十日鄭電闢謠稱：西北一貫擁護中央和平政策，現正力求安定進步，最近某國廣播及國內某種報紙所載西北某高級將領力主與共軍作戰到底，及某高級將領反對和談各節，均係毫無根據之闢言，應予否認。</p>
<h3>美衆院非美活動委會　調查沙奇間諜案　陸海軍情報處長均已被邀出席</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕衆院調查員十日開始調查在珍珠港事變前將日本及德國的計劃的情報供給蘇聯的沙奇間諜團，是否與美國的類似間諜組織，有所聯繫</p>
<p>非美活動委員會尤其希望獲悉此一太平洋區的間諜系統，是否與前共產黨員張伯斯所稱的在美活動的赤色間諜網，有任何聯繫。被陸軍部指控爲沙奇間諜團團員的名作家史沫德萊小姐及斯坦因均已先後否認與該團有關，繼史沫德萊之後，斯坦因亦於本日宣稱：關於他和沙奇問諜團的關係的報導，「荒謬而無稽」。</p>
<p>陸軍部情報處長伊爾溫少將及海軍部情報處長殷格里斯少將，均已被邀出席衆院非美活動委員會，報告戰前日本赤色間諜團的全部報告，以及日本赤色間諜團是否與美國境內的蘇聯間諜團活動有所聯繫，此項宣告與陸軍部的沙奇問諜團報告同時於本日發出·伊·殷二人己預定於十一日出席。聯邦檢察長克拉克亦已接獲邀請。委員會主席胡特對報界稱：克拉克及情報官員將被邀同時出席委員會，以附合委員會與行政部門間的合作的新政策。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕據十一日探悉：前共產黨員張伯斯會在去年十二月甘八日衆院非美活動委員會的秘密會議中，陳述渠在一九三四或三五年前後代蘇聯在日本的間諜團招募美人的經過。渠對衆院調查人員稱：渠爲此等工作人員在美國佈置一活動基地，爲一偽設的企業聯合組織，並由該組織供給工作人員的護照信件及基金，但在一九三六年因誤傳某一工作人員在日本被捕而撤銷。</p>
<p>在當時，此項證辭並未引起多大騷動，在委員會的報告中，僅寫着：「張伯斯稱：間諜團最初在美國招募人員，而在共他國家內展開活動，此等國家包括日本·德國·芬闌及中國」。</p>
<p>某一與當時的衆院非美人活動委員會有關的人仕稱：張伯斯所稱的間諜團，是否即係與陸軍部在十日所發表的「歷史上最大胆和成功的」日本沙奇間諜團有所聯繫，尙不能明白確定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十一日電〕麥帥總部主要情報官員魏洛裴少將十一日暗示：在今日的日本，亦可能有類似沙奇間諜團的間諜組織存在，在反對美國的權益下活動。</p>
<p>在招待記者會上，魏洛裴被詢以是否有反對美國權益的間諜團在今日的日本活動，魏氏承認他將避開正面的答覆，然後稱：沙奇間諜團與蘇聯在加拿大，美國及四南美國家內的問諜，組織出於一型，並繼稱：「吾人並無理由，能相信此種類型的間諜組織，不繼續在其他國家內活動」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕陸軍部十日官稱：蘇聯間諜網中日本首領尾崎的戰後幻夢，對現在的共黨思想實爲「有用的指標」，陸軍部稱：尾崎意想中之共黨新秩序，不但包括日本中國及蘇聯，並包有韓國，馬來亞，蒙古，菲律賓，暹羅，荷屬東印度，越南及印度，他夢想有一天這些國家的人民將依照蘇共的觀點及手段，與蘇聯結成一個全東亞蘇維埃聯邦共和國，日本雖會因以暴力企圖在東亞建立新秩序，而與中國及其他民族發生敵意，但在其泛亞洲宣傳中確有相當的號召力，馬來亞及緬甸所給與日本侵略軍的無數協助，是最近的事，今日吾人將聽取許多中國及印度方面的新秩序及泛亞洲主義，日本原有極好憑藉，但爲其貪婪及暴力所毀壞。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十一日電〕女作家史沫特萊今日向全國發表廣播演說，指斥陸軍部公佈之麥帥報告書對伊侮辱，據稱此種侮辱乃美國企圖全面干涉中國內戰之烟幕彈，本人將以誹謗罪控告麥帥。伊對報告書謂其依然消遙法外一節表示不屑置辯，僅稱全爲職業關係，不得不與官方及一般民衆保持接觸。史女士現在紐約州巴里薩特斯市，着手寫作第五部有關中國之書籍，與自傳「大地女兒」。</p>
<h3>渝綏署定本月十五日　召開西南軍政會　川東萬縣即成立警備部</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明十一日電〕渝綏署定十五日召開西南軍政會議，滇省府決派秘書楊適生參加，楊氏十二日飛渝。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十一日電〕一百零一軍軍長向敏思抵渝，請示川東北防務，十一日專車返達縣坐鎮。綏署爲加强川東自衛力量，決即在萬縣成立警備司令部。</p>

<h3>聯合國調處如有實效　我政府自表歡迎　孫科對外記者發表談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十一日電〕行政院長孫科對於澳洲外長伊瓦特建議聯合國斡旋中國和平一事，十一日晚向外記者發表英文談話，譯文如次：　聯合國調處我國之和平，倘能實際有效，則中國政府自表歡迎，唯對方亦須願意接受聯合國之調處，政府爲邀請第三方面居問斡旋和平計，會於數星期前以同樣之備亡忘錄分別致送英·法·美·蘇四國，聯合國苟能出面調處，自可同樣達成和平之目的。到現在爲止，政府經過一月餘之努力以謀致和平，仍未能與共黨獲得任何共同之諒解，政府雖會呼籲無條件停戰，且會任命和平代表，期與共黨會談，然共黨尙無誠意之表示，故直接談和或少可能，在此情形之下，聯合國之調處或爲獲致我國國內和平之唯一實用途徑，職是之故，政府對澳外長伊瓦特所作之建議，自表歡迎，並希望此項建議能獲接受。</p>
<p>潘議長盼伊瓦特正式向聯大建議</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕市參議會潘議長，昨對本屆聯合國大會主席澳外長伊瓦特建議，由聯合國斡旋中國戰亂一事，表示歡迎之忱。潘氏認爲，中國之和平與安定，根本非僅關係中國一國之事，而中國人民因戰亂所遭受之痛苦，及全國各地生命財產之破壞，以聯合國為謀世界人類和平之機構而言，對此實不容坐視不顧，故中國人民，固當無分東西南北，男女老幼，共同致力於全面和平之促成，但如聯合國此時亦能出面協助中國，以和平方式調解中國內部之戰爭，必能使過東與世界祛除其不安因素之一，而於永久和平必能有所裨益。潘氏以為，伊氏之提議，中國人民對之必均表感激，渠同時深望政府與中共雙方果眞均為人民着想，尙不致坐失此良好機會，自宜速卽接受聯合國之協助，以調停國內之戰亂，且盼澳外長能於最近期間正式向聯合國大會提出此項建議。</p>

<h3>歡迎聯合國的調解</h3>
<p>澳洲外長伊瓦特於本月九日在議會辯論外交時，突然提出由聯合國調解中國戰事的建議。他說：「就中國而言，一個長期而悲慘之戰爭，使全國動盪不定，並使長期受苦之人民有權享受之善後與復興遲遲無法實現。故余認爲聯合國應協助調停，俾獲一致之解決辦決，以拯救無數垂死之生靈；此與聯合國之原則相符。目下因大國間之意見分歧日益增加，且日見嚴重，故由聯合國担任調人與和解之仟務，實已特別需要」。澳外長基於悲天憫人的胸懊，對於長期受戰爭災難的中國人民寄以深切的同情，並盼望中國的戰事能早日得到合理的結束，以免生靈塗炭，乃提出由聯合國調解中國戰事的建議，實在值得我們的重視與感佩。何况伊瓦特外長現任聯合國大會的主席，這一重要而具有意義的建議，由他首先倡導，無疑的，一旦正式提議而後，必能獲得聯合國各國代表良好反應。</p>
<p>據本報南京十日來電稱：關於澳外長伊瓦特所提出由聯合國調解中國戰事的一項建議，此間政界人士對此反應極爲良好。政府某要員語記者云：在政府一再宣示與中共謀和之誠意而一再遭受中共拒絕之後，中國內戰之結束，勢非由國際調解不可。澳外長之建議，無疑將爲聯合國各國代表所重視而予以接受。中國經八年抗戰，而勝利後不久又發生內戰，人民痛苦不堪言狀，因抗禦暴力而產生之聯合國，對其昔日生死相共之中國人民，遭遇今日之嚴重災難，自應不能熱視無睹。上海市參議會潘議長，站在中國最大都市人民代表的立傷，昨天也首先發表歡迎聯合國調解的意見。</p>
<p>本來，站在國家民族的立塲而論，國際調解我國內戰，首先要感到慚愧。在人民世紀的今日，我們老百姓爲什麼還不能解決自己國內的事情而要由國際來調解？除非是自暴自棄的人受了自卑心理的作祟，才會歡迎國際干涉！再從歷史中探索教訓，國際調處內戰的結果，也往往是利少害多，俄德法三國干涉返還遼東半島的一幕，殷鑑不遠。所以，我們一向是對國際干涉有疑義的。但若以現實主義爲出發點，則在某種情勢之下，友邦的善意奔走與公平調處，排難解紛，使全國化干戈爲五帛，也是我們人民所歡迎。按之今日國內實際情形，經過抗戰八年內戰三年之後，人民死於砲火者何止數千萬人，即使僥倖而生存的，不是流離失所，就是饑寒交迫，如果內戰仍不停止，則這些倖存者，不死於砲火，也將無法活下去了。所以停戰媾和巳是全國上下的一致要求。蔣總統的元旦文告旣已宜示國人，政府確願棄戰言和，蔣總統本人又以引退示其求和之誠意，而李代總統更謂願以最高的誠意與最大的努力，以求和平之實現；就是在中共方面，毛澤東先生也不能不說：為減輕人民痛苦，願縮短戰爭時期。論理，雙方停戰和談，已是當前的國是，和平是不難立即實現的了。可是三月來，波折迭起，枝節叢生，和平的前途又似荊棘徧地。在孫內閣赴穗之前，吳外長也會一度暗示英美法蘇四國，願意四國共同調處，後因四國各自單獨答復，以恪守一九四五年莫斯科三國外長宜言爲詞，雅不欲捲入中國內戰漩渦，以致終未實現。國人鑒於四國的本身對於仟何國際事件的利害殊不一致，對此也非常冷淡，並不十分重視。因此，國際調處之說，也就烟銷雲散。一</p>
<p>然而這次澳外長提出由聯合國調解的建議，却不同於往日，引起了全國上下的重大注意。第一，站在法理上說，聯合國的基本原則，端在滄弭戰　，用促進國際間的合作與諒解的方法，確保世界和平與人類幸福，對於任何國際紛爭的須以和平的方法獲致解決。中國的戰事雖非顯然的國際戰爭，但在和平不可分割的原則之下，誰也不能保證中國的戰事不致擴大爲國際的戰爭。所以從這一點看過去，聯合國實負有調解中國內戰的責任與義務。第二，以現實而論，中共已以戰勝者自居，對於和談堅持政府無條件投降，不僅爲政府所不能接受，而且也不是公正人民所能同意，展望和談前途之所以日趨渺茫者以此。假若人民的呼籲還是依舊無力，而又沒有外來的調處，則內戰勢將持續，人民仍將不免於戰爭的浩刧。所以大家希望聯合國能够出面調處，自爲人情之常。第三，以調處的方式而論，聯合國調處比較四强聯合調解，切實易行，旣可以沒有「干涉中國內政」之嫌，又可免除中國人民對於列强調處後果的懷疑。所以，我們仍盼望四强能在聯合國機構的範圍內共同努力，促成中國的戰事早日結束。這不僅是中國人民之幸，而且也是全世界和平之福。各烟須知，中國的安定與和平，對於世界各國人民的幸福也有重大關係，此際聯合國實應把握時機，如果澳外長有正式建議，必當立即採取有效行動！</p>

<h3>中共電台廣播抨擊兩美記者</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十一日廣播：陝北中共電台今日廣播稱，美聯社記者穆沙與合衆社記者季昂所拍發之新聞，係「誹謗北平人民者」，已激起北平人民的憤怒，而予以猛烈的抨擊。據該電合稱：向該兩記者抗議者，有北大教授聞家駟，冀北電力公司工人，燕京學生自治會等要求「應該向北平人民道歉，認爲彼等係美帝國主義之爪牙。現竟聽其繼續活動「應把他們驅遂出境」，該電台並指出此二記者之報道中，「認爲北平人民會經以今天歡迎解放軍的同樣熊度，接待了日本人，美國人和國民黨」致遭共黨之不滿。又因美聯社滬記者漢普森十日報道，會稱上海的「外國記者們都把陝北電台對穆沙和季易的攻擊看得很嚴重」，該電台表示：「漢普森的邏輯是只准誹謗者誹謗別人，而不許被誹謗者知道這種誹謗。」又稱：「用這種侵略者的邏輯，能嚇倒中國人民的時代已經過去了。這就是漢普森，穆沙和季昂之流倒霉的地方。」據謂當共產黨軍隊佔領北平時，會一度公開聲稱：無論何種新聞均可自由拍發，現時平津報紙所發表之新聞極少，多不能饜讀者之望。</p>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕「中共是否准許世界各國記者在其轉境繼續工作」一問題，共方目前答復似爲一「否」字。北平中國報紙抨擊聯合社記者穆沙與合衆社記者季昂，顯因陝北中共電合前夜之中文廣播而起。中共電台昨夜以國際電碼發表長篇廣播，要求驅逐穆沙與季昂二人出境。其理由則爲該二記者報導北平人民歡迎共軍，措詞欠妥。賣則二人僅稱一部份人民歡迎共軍甚爲誠摯，另一部份不過到塲旁觀，尙有一部份之歡迎舉動似非全出本心。共方指斥穆沙以共軍入城與過去日軍，美軍及國民黨軍相比，穆沙並無此種報導，僅聯合社駐南京記者懷特批評北平共軍入城游行時會提及北平過去之歡迎日軍，謂中國人民如同世界各國多數人民參加游行慶祝已成習慣。該案發展如何，足以考騐新聞記者將來是否可在共黨統治之中國境內自由工作。</p>

<h3>美蘇如一旦發生戰爭　美準備退出日本　軍事專家認為遠東無固守價値</h3>

<p>鑒於此項戰略，美國在太平洋及遠東的整個地位，從阿拉斯加以至珍珠港，均將重予慎密檢討。共黨在中國的勝利，進一步加强了歐洲第一的觀念，在許多軍事計劃家的眼裹：日本是否具有任何軍事價值，大有疑問。而且他們認爲：在戰時供養及支持入千萬日本人民的任務，與日本人民所能給予美國的酬報，必然得不償失。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖十日鷺〕北韓政府十日向聯合國申請入會但美國支持的南韓，爲聯合國中大多數國承認爲朝鮮唯一合法政府，早已申請加入。鑒於聯大會不承認朝鮮北部地區，秘書長賴依僅將北韓之申請書轉交安理會各理事國以供參考。北韓外長白洪榮（譯音）申請書中稱，北韓政府「願與其他愛好和平國家合作，維持和平與國際安全」。北韓之申請似將永不會爲理事會議決，而南韓之要求亦必遭蘇聯之否決。</p>

<h3>湯總司令昨宣佈維持治安五準則　江防鞏固市民無庸惶慮</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕京滬杭警備總司令湯恩伯將軍，淤昨（十一）日下午三時，假新生活俱樂部，招待本市各界人土及新聞記者，即席宣佈維持本市治安秩序之五大準則，希望全市市民一致遵守，共同合作，以求上海治安與社會秩序之安定，謀求全面而合理之和平·湯氏並堅決表示：長江防務極爲鞏固，國軍之移守江防，非不能職，而係表示政府對和平之誠意。如共黨置此不顧，仍欲蠻幹到底，企圖渡江進犯京滬，絕非易事。渠聲稱：共軍欲在京滬附近渡江之迷夢，必將被粉碎無遺。渠特別指出國軍保衛上海之力量綽有餘裕，決不致遭遇長瀋平津之命運，故全市市民實無庸惶慮。湯氏致詞時首稱：政府不忍使人民繼續遭受砲火浩刦，自總統於元旦發表文告，身先引退以來，正由李代總絲委曲求全，努力謀求全面和平，本人受命艱危，警衛京滬杭區，傑覺責任之重大，惟軍人以服從侖令，衛國保民爲天職，本人誓當盡全力以保衛人民之生命財產，尤其上海係國際都市，爲我國文化經濟之中心，更不能不加强防衛，鎮定人心，以求安定社會秩序。本人認爲今日之中國，必須人民能獲得真正和平，眞正民主，與真正之自由，李受安居樂業之幸福，然後中國方有復興之望，此本人之所以對李代總統蔪求全面和平之苦心孤詣，竭誠擁護，而與我上海六百萬同胞不謀而同者也。惟今日之上海，爲接近戰區之戒嚴地區，應以肚會安定爲第一，以維持秩序爲最要，但以人口衆多，份子複雄，間有不逞之徒，潛伏活動，對政府種種苦心措施，常作歪曲之宣傳，施盡挑撥離問之詭技，致輿論混淆，謠言百出，人心因之浮動，秩序亦受影響，員工動輒聚衆要挾，作無理之要求，目無法紀，聲勢囂張，或使火車停駛，或使電車罷工，或威脅其主管長官，甚至阻碍交通，影響公用，使數百萬市民之日常生活，均蒙其害，此種現象，不獨本人負有糾正制止之責任，亦爲吾全市市民所深惡痛絕。實則所謂民主，必须人人守法，自由必須不妨害他人自由，和平必须共同遵守秩序。衛國保民，本人責無旁貸，惟任務之達成，實有賴於各界人士及全體袍澤之精誠台作，故特邀請諸位先生，發抒高見，共濟時艱，玆謹提供左列各項，以爲本市各界目前共守之準則：</p>
<p>（一）報紙刊物之言論及紀載，必須根據正確之事實，不得妄載謠言，淆亂視聽，並須以安定人心，維護祆序爲準則。凡停刊之報紙及刊物，非經主管機關之許可，一概不得復刊。（二）工人薪工之支給，應依法律慣例辦理，不得過分作無理之要求，如有任何改善待遇之意見，必須依法申請主管官署處理，不得有聚衆要挾罷工怠工以及類似之暴動行爲。（三）學校學生應體念國事艱難，多用理智，勿作影響社會秩序之行動，以免爲人利用，徒供犧牲。（四）各界人士應知社會秩序之維持，治安之確保，市民人人有責，故一切行動，切勿觸犯戒嚴法令。對於自衛及救濟慰勞等工作，尤盼殷富市民，慷慨輸將，共濟時艱。（五）本市駐軍，必須絕對遵守淞滬警備司令部二月八日公告之整飭上海市軍風紀要令，如有違犯，嚴懲不貸，並盼市民協助檢羅，共維軍紀，而安社會。</p>
<h3>嚴禁罷工等行為為首者就地槍決　駐軍令住問題商獲解決</h3>
<p>湯氏對禁止罷工怠工一點，補充聲稱，渠業已令京滬杭區各地警備司令，今後不論任何機構員工，不論其持何種理由，均不准有罷工怠工，聚衆要挾暴動等行爲，如有此項行爲發生，概依戒嚴法嚴厲處置，其爲首者授權各地警備司令按照軍法就地槍決。</p>
<p>湯氏對軍風紀問題，表示已與吳市長·潘議長·方主委等研究改善，目前影響軍風紀之兩大困難問題爲住房問題與士兵吃的問題，現已漸獲改善。關於住房問題，因上海附近營房缺少，軍隊住民房非僅市民不便，軍隊亦不便，現已決定解決辦法，暫准駐兵者，有下列三種：（一）未開課之學校，（二）己停工之工廠，（三）空餘之倉庫，如此相信可以避免借住民房。關於士兵吃的問題，因士兵副食費菲薄，上海物價高昂，不易維持，自本月份起，京滬區士兵之副食費，已獲提高至一千二百元，此係以每人每月可獲肉二斤油二斤鹽一斤爲標準。此外，柴火與蔬菜，則已由市府決定予以津貼。自本日起開始，以上兩項問題之獲得解決，相信軍風紀之維持，可不成問題。渠提及上海爲全國交通之樞紐，各方疏散人員均須經過上海，其來滬之軍事機關人員，容有管理欠於嚴密，而影響軍民感情者，淞滬警備司令部正設法盡力改善，以期達成秋毫無犯，軍民相安之理想。</p>
<p>吳市長指出市民之希望</p>
<p>出席招待會之各界首長，有吳市長國楨，潘議長公展，方主委治，徐副議長寄庼，及各界人士，各報社記者等約二百人。湯氏報告後，吳市長繼起致詞，指出全市市民目前共同之希望，爲（一）全面和平能够實現。（二）上海能獲安定。前者上海無能爲力，而後者切身利害攸關，應大家一致努力。但其隱置於本市蓄意破壞安定，假機生事之徒，正復不少，此輩實爲全市市民之公敵，故湯總司令宣佈之五項準則，係爲保障大衆之安全與利益，吾人應一致擁護遵從，并要求湯總司令嚴格執行。方主委致詞，提供兩點意見；（一）肅淸陰謀搗亂，挑撥離間份子，（二）全市市民應即有錢出錢，有物資捐輸物資，慰勞武裝將士。</p>
<p>潘議長建議應加強勞軍</p>
<p>潘議長致詞，首發表感想謂，聆湯總司令一席話，可知中央與地方對謀求全面和平，意見完全一致，渠亦建議，應即加强勞軍工作，唯有可以戰，才可以有和，但絕不可以投降。潘氏推祟太原軍民在閻錫山將軍領導之下之堅苦卓絕精神，值得上海市民效法。渠稱：京滬爲全國之心臟，絕不能動搖，故渠主張爲鞏固京滬，應以上海市民所納之稅款，提取數成，作爲鞏固京滬之費用，務使每一分錢用於士兵身上，使士兵獲得最優越之享受，則士氣大振，能戰能和。</p>
<p>答記才問</p>
<p>最後，湯總司令復起立致詞，并答覆記者所提之書面訽問，湯氏謂：（一）軍隊之戰鬥力，須要精神與物質來培養，故今後軍隊待遇，渠將盡力設法，并向中央要求提高。（二）關於穩定物價問題，渠將於最近期內，邀請各有關機關與專家研商辦法。（三）閘北有軍人住民房之事，交由警備部查辦，渠已飭屬於週內對軍人所住房屋，實行總檢查，此類事情當漸可减少。（四）關於建築工事問題，無論爲和爲戰，建築工事，皆屬需要，上海如不設防，將無和之資格。建築工事之經費，皆借自中央銀行，未用地方一文錢，而若干商人對建築工事所需之材料，乘機抬價，實屬不當。湯氏此外又列舉最近東北與北平濟南等地人民遭遇之痛苦，可爲其他各地人士之股鑑。湯氏末以「余決爲上海人服務，爲全上海市民之利益服務，上海必能保持永久之自由與完整」等語，結束此一招待會。</p>

<h3>燃料狂漲</h3>
<p>本市各類烟白煤，自新春以來，瘋狂疾升，各檔均創空前高峯。各大小工廠及公用事業與貧富市民無不遭受嚴重威脅。商業社記者昨向熟諳煤市者探悉，關於此次烟白煤斤之遞爾狂升，純係人爲所造成。蓋有若干大戶，迭施故技，造謠作祟，甚或操縱龍斷，抬價漁利，以致市塲現貨供應籌碼减少，人心堅秀，市價終被非法抬高。記者又向另一方面獲悉，烟白煤斤來源雖稍受阻滯，惟存儲本市者仍尙充沛，未會有短少情事。况各工廠及用戶均因市價高昂，而設法節省用度，故燃料消耗量亦較减削。職是之故，煤價之高易，純係非法抬高，前途實不堪設想云。</p>

<h3>Stay in Beiping for Five Days, Met with Ye Jianying and Others Several Times.  The Beijing Delegation Returns to the Capital.  The CCP's Attitude and Conditions for Peace Talks are Now Known.  Today's Audience with Acting President Li to Report on the Process.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 11th] The Beijing People's Peace Delegation, including Qiu Zhizhong, Wu Yuhao, and Hui Zisheng, went to Beiping to meet with CCP leaders in Beiping, including Ye Jianying, Lin Biao, and Nie Rongzhen, to exchange views on peace issues. They stayed in Beiping for five days and flew back to Beijing from Beiping by special plane at 5:00 PM on the 11th. Qiu, Wu, and others visited Ye Jianying, Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, and others several times in Beiping to inquire about the CCP's opinions on the peace issue and the techniques for conducting peace talks. At the same time, in the capacity of a third party, they conveyed to the current government their willingness for peace and the preparations for peace talks. They have now collected some information and have learned the CCP's attitude towards peace talks and the conditions that the CCP requires the government to earnestly implement. They are scheduled to pay a visit to Acting President Li on the 12th to report and convey the CCP's opinions to the government. After obtaining the government's response, it is hoped that the content will be published. According to a representative of the delegation, the result of their meeting with Ye, Lin, and others was that Ye, Lin, and others all expressed that the CCP is also willing to have peace, but it needs to go through some preparation. At least it must be after the complete liberation of Beiping. As to when Beiping will be considered completely liberated, Beiping is currently engaged in a household registration survey to ensure safety. Although there is no clear explanation of the definition of complete liberation, it is estimated that it can be completed within a month in terms of time. At that time, the CCP can be expected to send representatives to conduct peace talks. Although CCP leaders such as Ye and Lin have slightly different views on President Chiang and Acting President Li individually, there is not much difference. They still hold a cautious wait-and-see attitude towards Acting President Li's sincerity for peace, hoping that the person in charge of the peace talks can represent the entire government and have sufficient control. The delegation had planned to visit Fu Zuoyi on the 11th, but because they hurriedly returned to Beijing on the 11th, they did not have time to meet with Fu. The delegation's activities in Beiping were still relatively free, but for the sake of prudence, the CCP and the delegation agreed not to receive any Chinese or foreign reporters who visited. In addition, the six reporters who accompanied the delegation to Beiping were not allowed by the CCP to enter the city after arriving at the Xiyuan Airport. They stayed in the airport for five days and returned to Beijing on the original plane with the delegation on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 11th Broadcast: When the Shaanbei CCP radio station broadcasted today, it also publicly mentioned the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, including Qiu Zhizhong and others, negotiating peace in Beiping, and said that the mission had been "successfully completed." It also stated: Before the delegation left, it would publish a written conversation on the negotiation process, expressing gratitude for the warm reception of General Ye Jianying and the CCP authorities in Beiping. The broadcast pointed out that the Nanjing delegation had met with General Ye Jianying and others twice. The second conversation lasted more than four hours. It also said that Ye Jianying had promised to convey the delegation's opinions to the CCP Central Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 11th] The Beijing People's Peace Delegation flew back here on the 11th, and the meeting with the CCP leaders in Beiping ended, "quite encouraging." It is revealed that progress has been made on the Communist side's request for reorganizing the army and punishing war criminals. Fu Zuoyi was not arrested.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Shanghai Peace Delegation's trip to Beiping has been full of twists and turns. Gan Jiehou received a long-distance call from Beiping again at 12:00 midnight the day before yesterday, asking him to inform the delegation to postpone the flight to Beiping to the 13th. Gan then informed Yan Huiqing and other members of the delegation at 8:00 AM yesterday, and the trip to Beiping yesterday was cancelled again. According to the observation of qualified people, it is believed that the recent international situation has changed, and the US Tokyo meeting decided to aid China. The formation of a domestic peace negotiation situation is far less optimistic than expected. Under this atmosphere, the repeated postponement of the delegation's flight to Beiping is a matter of course. Even if Yan Huiqing and others cannot make the trip tomorrow, it is not surprising.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li and President Sun Have a Consistent Opinion on the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press Guangzhou, 11th] Senior government officials stated on the 11th: Acting President Li and other senior officials have reached a consensus with President Sun, that is, if the CCP does not want peace and does not start negotiations to end the civil war soon, the only way to follow will be to prepare for the final decisive battle. The official also stated: Acting President Li is expected to come to Guangzhou soon, because the hope of peace has collapsed. Acting President Li's coming to Guangzhou is to cooperate with President Sun and the cabinet to start the final preparations. However, President Li is expected to stay in Nanjing for some time as a sign that the government is willing to negotiate. At the same time, the government will rush to prepare for the Communist army's spring offensive across the Yangtze River, and hope that this action may soften the Communist side's conditions. The official also stated: US aid with extensive supervision rights may be obtained again, and this US aid will include military and economic aid. The government is already working on a tax reform plan as the basis for making this request. The government's main efforts will focus on the unity of South China to prevent partial peace settlements such as Beiping. Also, Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, will go to Shanghai on the 11th to persuade the members of the two houses to come to Guangzhou to take office. Sun Ke and other officials openly and secretly denied that the suspicions between Guangdong and Guangxi provinces were the cause of differences in government opinions, but they admitted that there were differences of opinion regarding the government's move to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Bureau Chiefs Walk to Work</h3>
<p>Because Cars Have Been Requisitioned</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 11th] Since the various ministries and courtyards have moved south one after another, there is a great shortage of cars here. Almost all of the official cars of the bureau chiefs of the municipal government, from Mayor Ouyang down, have been requisitioned, making the bureau chiefs walk to work, which is also a small scene in the government's southward migration.</p>
<h3>Lapham Returns to the United States in the Middle of the Month</h3>
<p>The First Batch of EC Fertilizer Arrives in Our Country</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 11th] Lapham stated that his visit to Guangzhou this time was to bid farewell to President Sun. He was ordered to return to the United States before the 16th to report to Congress on the economic cooperation in China, and to inspect the work of the branch office here and to contact the China Agricultural Rehabilitation Commission. As for the rumors that Lapham will hold a meeting with President Sun and others in Guangzhou to discuss US aid, he did not acknowledge it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 11th] At the joint meeting of the Executive Yuan's US Aid Material Utilization Committee and the Economic Cooperation Sub-Office yesterday, Executive Yuan President Sun Ke expressed his hope to obtain more extensive assistance from the US government. Lapham paid special attention to Guangdong and Guangzhou, which have actually become the new political center of China.</p>
<p>[Our City News] The first batch of EC fertilizer has arrived in China. 900 metric tons of ammonium sulfate were shipped from Canada to Shanghai by the "Agnewen" today. US-aided fertilizer will be distributed to Chinese farmers through the Farmers Bank of China.</p>
<h3>The Next Legislative Yuan Meeting Will Be Held in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 11th] According to United Press investigation: The opinions of qualified parties here show that Sun Ke's insistence on establishing his cabinet in Guangzhou may cost him his position. According to the disclosure of this investigation: When the Legislative Yuan convenes the next plenary session, the increasing condemnation of President Sun may become an organized movement. Qualified Legislative Yuan parties stated: The next Legislative Yuan meeting will be held in Nanjing, not in Guangzhou. It is generally believed that the decision to hold the five-court meeting in Nanjing will undoubtedly be a serious blow to President Sun's political position. The parties also stated: Although the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan has moved to Guangzhou and legislators in Guangzhou have requested that the meeting be held in a South China city, most legislators agree to stay in Nanjing. They also stated: The legislators who are currently staying in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas first decided to keep the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing and have obtained the support of legislators in Hankou, Guilin, and other three places. It is rumored that Shanghai legislators have sent representatives to Taiwan to obtain the support of legislators there. At the same time: People of high standing insist that Acting President Li and President Sun have no differences of opinion regarding the southward relocation of the Executive Yuan. The person also stated: Acting President Li has advised Sun Ke's cabinet to stay in Nanjing, and Li has not interfered in the recent dispute over the location of the Legislative Yuan meeting.</p>
<h3>Presidential Palace Staff Limited to Arriving in Guangzhou Before the Middle of the Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 11th] It is reported that the main part of the documents of the Presidential Palace has arrived in Guangzhou, and the rest are being shipped one after another. The staff of the Palace are required to report to Guangzhou before the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Zheng Yanfen Solemnly Denies the Saying That a Central Committee Plenary Session Will Be Held Regularly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 11th] Several newspapers in Hong Kong and Guangdong have recently reported that the Kuomintang will hold a plenary session of the Central Committee in Guangzhou on March 29th. According to Zheng Yanfen, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, who solemnly declared to reporters, the Central Party Headquarters has not considered the issue of holding a Central Committee Plenary Session after leaving Beijing and moving to Guangzhou. There is no scheduled meeting. The report that a plenary session will be held regularly is absolutely not true.</p>
<h3>Cheng Siyuan Returns to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Legislator Cheng Siyuan took a train to Beijing on the evening of the 11th after returning to Shanghai from Taiwan.</p>
<h3>National Army Rushes to Aid Yichang. The Situation Between Hankou and Yichang Turns Stable. Telecommunications are Restored. The Chongqing-Shanghai Air Route Remains Unobstructed.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 11th] Chief of Staff Liu received a long-distance call from the front line at 10:00 AM on the 11th: (1) The Communist army that invaded Yichang was repelled this morning. The Communist army has now fled to more than 40 miles away from Yichang. The 60th Division of the National Army has rushed to Yichang to increase its strength. (2) Sun Zhen is currently in Santouping.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou, 11th] It is reported that the military telephone in Yichang was once blocked. On the 11th, the situation turned stable, and it has returned to normal.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou, 11th] During the recent battle of Jingmen, the county magistrate of the county, Zou Shusheng, unfortunately died heroically while leading his troops to break through the siege.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 11th] The order in Yichang has not yet been restored. The Yimin Sheng Company's machine factory was robbed for three hours late at night on the 10th, suffering serious losses. Ships berthed at Ping Shanba Huangling Temple Santouping could not control the scattered soldiers who forcibly boarded the ships and lacked coal, and have not yet gone west today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou, 11th] A group of 14 Wuhan reporters from the front-line visiting group set off on the morning of the 11th to inspect the defense area in southern Henan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hengdian, Hubei-Henan Border, 11th] The reporter arrived at a certain place today with the Wuhan reporters' front-line inspection group and immediately interviewed General Zhang Gan and his strong soldiers of the Central China Fortress. Zhang declared at the tea party: The three columns of Liu Bocheng's troops, 1, 6, and 4, stationed in the Yancheng area, except for a part of the 4th column, have mostly fled north. The 2, 3, 6, and 12 columns west of Xincai have also moved northwest one after another. The various units of this corps are currently widely deployed within the borders of Henan and Hubei, preparing for strategic operations according to the opportunity. The Communist army will definitely not be able to invade the south in the short term. Even if they take risks, it is believed that they will be able to protect the land and defend the people. At about 7:00 PM, Zhang invited reporters to participate in the evening party. The army and the people were integrated and rejoiced together, and the atmosphere was very warm.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Hankou, 11th] The Yangtze River Chongqing-Shanghai air route is still unimpeded. The Jianghan ship of the China Merchants Bureau sailed from Hankou to Shanghai on the 4th and arrived safely on the 9th. The Jianghe, Jiangshun, Jiangtai of the bureau and the Hongzhen, Hongheng of the Sanbei Company, and the Dada of the Yitai Company all sailed from Shanghai to Hankou and have passed Anqing and will arrive in the next few days. Also, the Minzu ship of the Minsheng Company passed Yichang yesterday and went west. The Mingui ship is now berthed in Shashi, and the navigation is very safe.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 11th] It was learned on the 11th that a large number of Communist troops crossed the Yellow River in northern Henan and advanced towards the Yangtze River front line. If this news is true, it is in sharp contrast to the continued silence of the war on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Observers believe that: (1) The CCP will insist on its peace conditions while preparing to cross the Yangtze River south with more troops to attack if the peace talks fail; (2) This new military force may be used to reinforce the Communist army that has withdrawn from the front line on the north bank of the Yangtze River for reorganization; (3) Continue to launch a nerve war against Hankou, because General Bai Chongxi has instructed his subordinates to fully prepare for war to meet the possible offensive. Observers believe that this new military force may have been transferred from the vicinity of Taiyuan, the besieged capital of Shanxi Province, where the pressure has apparently been reduced.</p>
<h3>Xu Kan and Others Inspect Huangpu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 11th] Finance Minister Xu Kan, President of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun, accompanied by Fang Du, Customs Commissioner of Guangdong Customs, and more than a dozen economic engineering experts, went to Huangpu yesterday to inspect the port opening project and make plans for future construction.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Resigns as Peace Talk Representative. After Finishing Public Affairs in Lanzhou, He Will Go to Xinjiang.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Lanzhou, 11th] The spokesman of the Northwest Pacification Headquarters released by telephone late last night that Zhang Zhizhong had resolutely telegraphed the central government to resign from the task of peace talk representative. It is generally believed that Zhang, who was enthusiastic about peace, suddenly became negative, which made the situation even more chaotic.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Lanzhou, 11th] General Zhang Zhizhong believed that there were many things to be handled in the Northwest Military and Political Chief's Office, and Xinjiang also hoped that General Zhang would visit there. It was heard that he had telegraphed the Central Government to resign from the task of peace talk representative. The special plane Ziqiang sent by Acting President Li to welcome Zhang had returned to Beijing yesterday. Zhang will probably visit Xinjiang after the important affairs here are taken care of.</p>
<p>Northwest Pacification Headquarters Denies Anti-Peace and War Advocacy</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Lanzhou, 10th] The spokesman of the Northwest Pacification Headquarters Zheng Dian refuted the rumors on the 10th, saying: The Northwest has always supported the central government's peace policy and is now striving for stability and progress. The recent broadcasts of a certain country and certain domestic newspapers that a certain senior general in the Northwest advocated fighting the Communist army to the end, and that a certain senior general opposed peace talks, are all unfounded rumors and should be denied.</p>
<h3>The US House of Representatives Un-American Activities Committee Investigates the Sorge Spy Case. The Directors of the Army and Navy Intelligence Bureaus Have Been Invited to Attend.</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 10th] House investigators began investigating the Sorge spy ring on the 10th, which provided the Soviet Union with intelligence on Japanese and German plans before the Pearl Harbor incident, and whether it was linked to similar spy organizations in the United States.</p>
<p>The Un-American Activities Committee especially hopes to learn whether this Pacific region spy system has any connection with the Red spy network operating in the United States, as claimed by former communist member Chambers. Miss Smedley, a well-known writer and Stein, who were accused by the War Department of being members of the Sorge spy ring, have both denied being involved in the ring. Following Smedley, Stein also declared today that the reports about his relationship with the Sorge spy ring were "absurd and unfounded."</p>
<p>Major General Irwin, Director of the Army Intelligence Bureau, and Major General Inglis, Director of the Navy Intelligence Bureau, have both been invited to attend the House Un-American Activities Committee to report on all reports of the Japanese Red spy ring before the war, and whether the Japanese Red spy ring was linked to the activities of the Soviet spy ring in the United States. This announcement was issued on the same day as the War Department's Sorge spy ring report. Irwin and Inglis are scheduled to attend on the 11th. Federal Prosecutor Clark has also received an invitation. Committee Chairman Hoot told the press that Clark and intelligence officials would be invited to attend the committee at the same time to comply with the committee's new policy of cooperation with the executive branch.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 11th] It was learned on the 11th that former communist member Chambers stated in a secret meeting of the House Un-American Activities Committee on December 28th last year that he had recruited Americans for the Soviet Union's spy ring in Japan around 1934 or 1935. He told House investigators that he set up an activity base in the United States for these workers, which was a fictitious corporate alliance, and the organization provided the workers with passports, letters, and funds, but it was revoked in 1936 due to a false rumor that a worker was arrested in Japan.</p>
<p>At the time, this testimony did not cause much commotion. In the committee's report, it was only written: "Chambers said: The spy ring initially recruited personnel in the United States and launched activities in other countries, including Japan, Germany, Finland, and China."</p>
<p>A person involved with the House Un-American Activities Committee at the time said: It is not clear whether the spy ring mentioned by Chambers is the same as the Japanese Sorge spy ring, which the War Department announced on the 10th as the "most daring and successful in history."</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 11th] Major General Willoughby, the main intelligence officer of MacArthur's headquarters, hinted on the 11th that there may also be spy organizations similar to the Sorge spy ring operating in Japan today, opposing American interests.</p>
<p>At a press conference, Willoughby was asked whether there were spy rings operating in Japan today that opposed American interests. Willoughby admitted that he would avoid a direct answer, and then said: The Sorge spy ring and the Soviet Union's spies in Canada, the United States, and four South American countries were of the same type, and continued: "We have no reason to believe that this type of spy organization will not continue to operate in other countries."</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 10th] The War Department officially stated on the 10th that the post-war fantasy of Ozaki, the Japanese leader of the Soviet spy network, was a "useful indicator" of current communist ideology. The War Department stated: Ozaki's envisioned communist new order not only included Japan, China, and the Soviet Union, but also included South Korea, Malaya, Mongolia, the Philippines, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and India. He dreamed that one day the people of these countries would form an all-East Asian Soviet Federal Republic with the Soviet Union in accordance with the Soviet Communist Party's views and methods. Although Japan would have enmity with China and other nations for trying to establish a new order in East Asia by force, it did have considerable appeal in its Pan-Asian propaganda. The countless assistance given to the Japanese invaders by Malaya and Burma is a recent matter. Today, we will hear many new orders and Pan-Asianism from China and India. Japan originally had excellent resources, but it was destroyed by its greed and violence.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 11th] Female writer Smedley made a radio address to the nation today, denouncing the MacArthur report released by the War Department as an insult to her. It is said that this insult is a smokescreen for the United States' attempt to fully interfere in the Chinese civil war. She disdained to refute the report's statement that she was still at large, only saying that it was entirely a professional relationship and had to maintain contact with officials and the general public. Ms. Smith is now in Palisades, New York, working on her fifth book on China and her autobiography, "Daughter of Earth."</p>

<h3>Our Government Welcomes Effective United Nations Mediation. Sun Ke Issues a Statement to Foreign Reporters.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 11th] Executive Yuan President Sun Ke issued an English statement to foreign reporters on the evening of the 11th regarding the Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's proposal that the United Nations mediate peace in China. The translation is as follows: The Chinese government welcomes the United Nations' mediation of peace in our country if it can be practical and effective. However, the other party must also be willing to accept the United Nations' mediation. In order to invite a third party to mediate peace, the government sent the same memorandum to the four countries of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union several weeks ago. If the United Nations can come forward to mediate, it can achieve the same goal of peace. So far, the government has made efforts for more than a month to achieve peace, but it has not been able to reach any common understanding with the Communist Party. Although the government has called for an unconditional ceasefire and has appointed peace representatives to meet with the Communist Party, the Communist Party has not shown any sincerity. Therefore, direct peace talks are unlikely. Under these circumstances, the United Nations' mediation may be the only practical way to achieve domestic peace in our country. Therefore, the government welcomes the proposal made by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt and hopes that this proposal can be accepted.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan Hopes that Evatt Will Formally Propose to the General Assembly</p>
<p>[Central News Agency This City News] Speaker Pan of the City Council expressed his welcome yesterday to the proposal made by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, the President of the current United Nations General Assembly, that the United Nations mediate the war in China. Pan believes that the peace and stability of China is not just a matter for China alone, and the suffering of the Chinese people due to the war and the destruction of life and property throughout the country, as far as the United Nations is concerned as an organization for the peace of the world, it cannot sit idly by. Therefore, the Chinese people, regardless of east, west, north, south, men, women, old and young, should jointly devote themselves to promoting comprehensive peace, but if the United Nations can also come forward at this time to assist China in mediating the internal war in China in a peaceful way, it will be able to remove one of the destabilizing factors in the Far East and the world, and will be beneficial to lasting peace. Pan believes that the Chinese people will all be grateful for Evatt's proposal. He also deeply hopes that both the government and the CCP are really thinking about the people, and will not miss this good opportunity, and should immediately accept the assistance of the United Nations to mediate the domestic war, and hope that the Australian Foreign Minister can formally propose this proposal to the United Nations General Assembly in the near future.</p>

In response to the reporter's inquiries about the current situation and his meeting with Chairman Chen and the release of Zhang Xueliang, he only said that he could not tell anything except that he would visit Zhang Hanqing as soon as he recovered his strength.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Welcoming the United Nations Mediation</h3>
<p>Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, during a parliamentary debate on foreign affairs on the 9th of this month, suddenly proposed that the United Nations mediate the Chinese war. He said, "As for China, a long and tragic war has destabilized the entire country and delayed the post-war recovery and reconstruction that the long-suffering people have the right to enjoy. Therefore, I believe that the United Nations should assist in mediating to achieve a unanimous solution to save countless dying lives; this is in line with the principles of the United Nations. At present, due to the increasing and serious differences of opinion among the major powers, it is particularly necessary for the United Nations to undertake the task of mediation and reconciliation." Based on his compassion, the Australian Foreign Minister expressed deep sympathy for the Chinese people who have suffered from the disaster of war for a long time, and hoped that the Chinese war could be brought to a reasonable end as soon as possible to avoid the suffering of the people, and proposed the United Nations mediate the Chinese war, which is worthy of our attention and admiration. Moreover, Foreign Minister Evatt is currently the President of the United Nations General Assembly. This important and meaningful proposal, initiated by him, will undoubtedly receive a good response from representatives of various countries in the United Nations once it is formally proposed.</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from our Nanjing on the 10th, regarding the suggestion by the Australian Foreign Minister Evatt that the United Nations mediate the Chinese war, political figures here have reacted very favorably. A certain government official told reporters: After the government repeatedly declared its sincerity in seeking peace with the Communist Party of China (CPC) but was repeatedly rejected by the CPC, the end of the Chinese civil war will inevitably require international mediation. The Australian Foreign Minister's proposal will undoubtedly be valued and accepted by representatives of various countries in the United Nations. After eight years of resistance against Japan, China soon after victory broke into a civil war, causing unspeakable suffering to the people. The United Nations, which was created to resist violence, should not turn a blind eye to the serious disaster that its former ally, the Chinese people, are facing today. Shanghai Municipal Council Speaker Pan, standing on the side of the representatives of the people of China's largest city, also first expressed his welcome to the United Nations mediation yesterday.</p>
<p>Originally, standing on the position of the nation and the race, we should first feel ashamed of the international mediation of our civil war. In today's era of the people, why can't we ordinary people solve our own domestic affairs and have to be mediated by the international community? Unless it is a self-abandoned person who is troubled by inferiority complex, will he welcome international intervention! Furthermore, exploring lessons from history, the result of international mediation of civil wars is often more harmful than beneficial. The scene of Russia, Germany, and France intervening to return the Liaodong Peninsula is not far away. Therefore, we have always had doubts about international intervention. However, if we start from realism, then under certain circumstances, the goodwill efforts and fair mediation of friendly countries to resolve difficulties and turn hostility into peace is also welcomed by our people. According to the actual situation in the country today, after eight years of resistance against Japan and three years of civil war, no less than tens of millions of people have died in the war. Even those who are lucky enough to survive are either displaced or starving and freezing. If the civil war does not stop, then these survivors will either die in the war or will not be able to survive. Therefore, a ceasefire and peace negotiation is the unanimous request of the entire country. President Chiang's New Year's Day message has already declared to the people that the government is indeed willing to abandon war and make peace. President Chiang himself has shown his sincerity in seeking peace by retiring, and Acting President Li has even said that he is willing to use the highest sincerity and the greatest efforts to seek the realization of peace. Even on the CPC side, Mr. Mao Zedong could not but say: To reduce the suffering of the people, we are willing to shorten the war period. Theoretically, a ceasefire and peace talks between the two sides is already the current national policy, and peace is not difficult to realize immediately. However, in the past three months, twists and turns have occurred one after another, and there are many trivial issues, and the prospect of peace seems to be full of thorns. Before the Sun cabinet went to Guangzhou, Foreign Minister Wu once hinted to the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union that they were willing to jointly mediate, but because the four countries each responded individually, citing the need to abide by the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Declaration, they did not want to get involved in the Chinese civil war, so it was never realized. The people of the country, in view of the fact that the four countries themselves have different interests in any international event, are also very indifferent to this and do not pay much attention to it. Therefore, the theory of international mediation has also disappeared.</p>
<p>However, this time the Australian Foreign Minister's proposal for United Nations mediation is different from the past and has aroused great attention from the entire country. First, from a legal point of view, the basic principle of the United Nations lies in eliminating wars and ensuring world peace and human happiness by promoting international cooperation and understanding, and any international dispute must be resolved by peaceful means. Although the Chinese war is not an obvious international war, under the principle that peace is indivisible, no one can guarantee that the Chinese war will not expand into an international war. Therefore, from this point of view, the United Nations has the responsibility and obligation to mediate the Chinese civil war. Second, in reality, the CPC has regarded itself as the victor and insists on the government's unconditional surrender in peace talks, which is not only unacceptable to the government, but also cannot be agreed upon by fair-minded people. This is why the prospect of peace talks is becoming increasingly bleak. If the people's appeal is still powerless, and there is no external mediation, then the civil war will continue, and the people will still be subjected to the ravages of war. Therefore, it is only natural for everyone to hope that the United Nations can come forward to mediate. Third, in terms of the method of mediation, United Nations mediation is more practical and easier to implement than four-power joint mediation. It can not only avoid the suspicion of "interfering in China's internal affairs," but also eliminate the doubts of the Chinese people about the consequences of great power mediation. Therefore, we still hope that the four powers can work together within the framework of the United Nations to promote an early end to the Chinese war. This is not only the fortune of the Chinese people, but also the blessing of world peace. All countries must know that the stability and peace of China are also of great importance to the happiness of the people of all countries in the world. At this moment, the United Nations should seize the opportunity. If the Australian Foreign Minister has a formal proposal, it must immediately take effective action!</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Reports on Provincial Affairs; Economic Issues are the Focus of Governance; Six Principles for Public and Education Treatment are Set</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 11th] Chairman Chen today made a broad report on the governance situation in the past month at a press conference held by the Provincial Information Office, and comprehensively answered inquiries. Chen said: In the past month, economic issues have been the focus of governance. It has been decided to organize an Economic Construction Research Committee, and relevant supervisors and experts will be hired as members. The main task is to study the situation of production supply and demand and the economic changes, so that state-owned and provincial-owned production enterprises can respectively formulate central tasks to cooperate with the national economy and achieve the Principle of People's Livelihood. The existing industrial, mining, agricultural, and forestry enterprises will be reorganized, and those with redundant branches will be cut or merged, which is currently under review. Regarding the issue of public and education treatment, six principles have now been decided: (1) Equal pay for equal work in the same place, regardless of provincial or county level. (2) Consistency between civil and military personnel. (3) Approximation of the difference. (4) Additional grades for technical personnel. (5) Seniority grade increases. (6) In-kind distribution. This new treatment method will be implemented from March, and February will be supplemented with salary loans. Next, answering inquiries: (1) The local self-government has formed a research association, which will actively formulate methods and implement them effectively. (2) The conscription issue is in the preparatory stage, but it will never be conscripted in the 38th year. (3) Taipei City will use vacant land to build 500 houses to solve the housing shortage.</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 11th] Chairman Chen recently agreed with the National Resources Commission to allocate 3,000 tons of sugar, worth about NT$10 billion, as a special fund to improve public and education treatment. The fund will not be used to increase salaries, but will be used to enrich the fund for in-kind distribution.</p>

<h3>Workers Carelessly Disassemble Discarded Bombs; Ammunition Depot in Guangzhou Suburbs Explodes; More Than Forty People Including the Factory Director Die Miserably</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th] The Tenth Depot of the Waste Products Department of the 80th Ordnance Repair Factory of the Joint Logistics Department in Shijing, about 30 kilometers from the urban area of Guangzhou (formerly the Shijing Ordnance Factory), exploded at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th due to workers carelessly disassembling discarded bombs, triggering the hand grenades, mortar shells, small landmines, and ordinary artillery shells left by the former Japanese army stored in the depot. The rumbling sound spread far and wide, and could be heard clearly in Guangzhou. The depot was originally a large bungalow with cement pillars and tile surface, about two zhang high and eight zhang long. The entire building collapsed. Only five of the forty-seven workers escaped, and four of them were injured. The factory director, after hearing the first loud noise, rushed to the depot to inspect it. The second, most powerful ammunition exploded, and he was tragically killed by the blast. As of 4:00 p.m. when the reporter left the area, the ammunition was still exploding continuously. A loud noise occurred almost every few minutes, and the flames shot into the sky. The First Detachment of Yubei Rescue and the Guangzhou Fire Brigade dispatched fire trucks to rescue, but could not get close. Now the authorities have only assigned a large number of soldiers to be on guard on all sides to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Two Soldiers Sentenced for Forcing Donations and Sealing Vehicles</h3>

<h3>Communist Radio Broadcasts Criticisms of Two American Reporters</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] San Francisco, 11th Broadcast: The Shaanxi Communist Radio Station broadcast today that the news sent by Associated Press reporter Musa and United Press reporter Jian were "slanders against the people of Beiping," which aroused the anger of the people of Beiping and gave them fierce criticism. According to the radio station, the protesters against the two reporters included Professor Wen Jiashi of Peking University, workers of Jibei Electric Power Company, and the Student Union of Yenching University, who demanded that "they should apologize to the people of Beiping, and believe that they are pawns of American imperialism. Now that they are allowed to continue their activities, "they should be deported." The radio station also pointed out that in the reports of these two reporters, "they believed that the people of Beiping had welcomed the Japanese, Americans and Kuomintang with the same attitude as they welcome the Liberation Army today," which caused dissatisfaction among the Communists. Furthermore, because Associated Press Shanghai reporter Hampson reported on the 10th that the "foreign reporters in Shanghai took the Shaanxi radio station's attack on Musa and Ji Yi very seriously," the radio station said: "Hampson's logic is that only slanderers are allowed to slander others, and those who are slandered are not allowed to know this kind of slander." It also said: "The era of intimidating the Chinese people with this logic of aggressors is over. This is where Hampson, Musa and Ji Yi and others are unlucky." It is said that when the Communist army occupied Beiping, they once publicly stated that any news can be freely sent, but now the news published in the newspapers in Pingjin is very little, and most of them cannot satisfy the wishes of the readers.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch] The answer from the Communist side on the question of "whether the Communist Party will allow reporters from all over the world to continue working in their territory" seems to be "no" for the time being. The criticism of United Press reporter Musa and United Press reporter Ji Ang by the Chinese newspapers in Beiping was apparently caused by the Chinese broadcast of the Shaanxi Communist Radio Station the night before. The Communist Radio Station issued a lengthy broadcast in international telegraph code last night, demanding the expulsion of Musa and Ji Ang. The reason is that the two reporters reported that the people of Beiping welcomed the Communist army, but the wording was inappropriate. In fact, the two only said that some people welcomed the Communist army very sincerely, another part just went to the venue to watch, and the welcoming actions of another part seemed not entirely from the heart. The Communist side accused Musa of comparing the entry of the Communist army with the past Japanese army, American army and Kuomintang army. Musa did not have this kind of report. Only United Press reporter White stationed in Nanjing criticized the Beiping Communist army's entry parade, mentioning that the people of Beiping had welcomed the Japanese army in the past, saying that it has become a habit for the Chinese people, like most people in the world, to participate in parades and celebrations. How the case develops is enough to test whether news reporters can freely work in the territory of China under Communist rule in the future.</p>

<h3>Shigeru Yoshida Re-Elected as the New Prime Minister of Japan; Plans to Form a Conservative Cabinet of Two Parties; MacArthur Agrees to This Decision</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] After Shigeru Yoshida resigned this morning in accordance with constitutional procedures, he was re-elected as prime minister by an absolute majority of 350 votes in the House of Representatives. The total number of valid votes was 451. When the members voted, Yoshida sat quietly in his seat and never stood up except when it was his turn to vote. His body was short, and his line of sight was obscured by the table, making it difficult to see the voting situation, but he smiled, confident that he was sure to be elected.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] The 77-year-old Kijuro Shidehara, the elder of the Japanese Democratic Party, was unanimously supported by the members of the conservative group, and was elected as the Speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives with a majority of 346 votes. The Socialist Party member Yonekubo, who competed with him, although supported by the left-wing members, only received 91 votes and ultimately failed. It is said that Shidehara will replace Matsuoka of the Socialist Party as the Speaker. As for the seat of Vice Speaker of the House of Representatives, it will be taken by Osamu Osatake of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 11th] Hirokawa, the Secretary-General of the Japanese Liberal Party, announced at its headquarters late on the 10th that "as a result of the second meeting between Yoshida and Inukai, it is believed that in order to overcome the current economic crisis in Japan, a coalition government composed of two conservative parties must be formed in order to obtain long-term stability." Hirokawa also stated that this decision has been agreed by MacArthur. Hirokawa announced this time that the conservative coalition government will be announced in the form of a joint statement by Yoshida and Inukai, the presidents of the two parties. Afterwards, Hirokawa told reporters that this decision is only a decision in principle. As for how the two parties will allocate cabinet positions in the future and whether to formulate a policy agreement, it has not yet been discussed.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Since Inukai and Yoshida's meeting on the 10th decided on the principle of a conservative coalition cabinet, the phenomenon of division within the Democratic Party has become very obvious. The Ashida faction firmly opposes cooperation with Yoshida. As a result, seven or eight members of the Ashida faction will withdraw from the Democratic Party. However, it is not clear whether they will form a new party or join other parties.</p>
<h3>If War Breaks Out Between the US and USSR, the US Plans to Withdraw from Japan; Military Experts Believe the Far East Has No Defensive Value</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 11th] According to several senior US military strategists, if war breaks out between the US and USSR, the US is prepared to withdraw from Japan. They believe that the entire Far East has no defensive value. In a war, the European continent will become the decisive battlefield, and the US must maintain a foothold in Europe, or prepare to fight for fifteen to twenty years to win the final victory.</p>
<p>In view of this strategy, the entire US position in the Pacific and the Far East, from Alaska to Pearl Harbor, will be carefully reviewed. The Communist victory in China has further strengthened the "Europe first" concept. In the eyes of many military planners, whether Japan has any military value is highly questionable. Moreover, they believe that the task of feeding and supporting tens of millions of Japanese people in wartime is bound to outweigh the benefits Japan can provide to the US.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 11th] The Japanese people learned the news on the 11th with shock, horror, and a degree of disbelief, that the US is prepared to withdraw from Japan if the Soviet Union invades.</p>
<h3>US Aid to Europe Aims to Promote Unity</h3>
<p>Aid to China to be Discussed in Secret Later; Acheson Declares to Congress</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 11th (Broadcast): US Secretary of State Dean Acheson stated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that US economic aid cannot be used as a tool to force Western European countries to implement political unity. The US will encourage such unity, but the final decision rests with the Europeans themselves. Regarding inquiries about the North Atlantic Treaty or possible aid to China, Acheson declined to answer publicly, but suggested discussing such issues in secret later. Acheson denied that the US recovery fund hinders economic cooperation between European countries, and said that the Brussels Treaty, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, and the newly organized European Parliament are all important steps in promoting European political, economic, and social unity.</p>
<h3>Lie Expresses His Views; Comments on Regional Treaties</h3>
<p>Should Be Based on Strengthening the United Nations as a Principle</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 11th (Broadcast): Lake Success Dispatch - UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie warned today that any regional treaty that replaces "genuine universal collective security" will ultimately endanger lasting peace. Lie did not specifically point out whether he was referring to the North Atlantic Treaty or other regional treaties, but stated that any regional convention should "strengthen the United Nations organization rather than weaken it." Since the UN organization has failed to achieve results in handling several important international disputes, regional military or economic conventions have greatly increased. This is Lie's first comment on this.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Insists on Including a Ban on Employing Foreign Military Personnel in the Austrian Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 11th (Broadcast): During the Four Powers' discussion of the Austrian peace treaty, Soviet representative Cherubin insisted that Austria be prohibited from employing foreign military advisors and technicians, and that this should be stipulated in the Austrian peace treaty. Western sources said that Cherubin was clearly afraid that the US would send military advisors to Austria, as US Army officers in Greece have made great contributions to the Greek government's fight against communist guerrillas. Cherubin gave a lengthy speech supporting the proposed ban on Austria.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Protestant Leaders Arrested</h3>
<p>Similar to the Mindszenty Case in Substance</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 11th (Broadcast): US State Department officials believe that the arrest of fifteen Protestant leaders in Bulgaria is a trick played by the minority communists in satellite countries, and that the nature of this matter is similar to the case of Bishop Mindszenty in Hungary. Experts believe that the arrest of Christian leaders is a further manifestation of the Bulgarian authorities' suppression of religious freedom.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 11th (Broadcast): A Foreign Office spokesman criticized the arrest of fifteen Protestant leaders in Bulgaria, saying that Eastern European countries are now attacking the church in a unified way, creating a communist monolithic situation. The British government is currently considering further action based on the peace treaty with Bulgaria, which guarantees religious freedom.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Sofia, 10th] The Bulgarian government tonight filed public charges against ten leaders of the United Evangelical Church, accusing them of providing espionage to British and American intelligence, conspiring to overthrow the government, and violating foreign exchange control regulations. The representative of the Church, Chipkov, was listed as a prisoner. The United Evangelical Church is composed of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Baptist Church, and the Pentecostal Church.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's New Proposal Ultimately Vetoed; Security Council Passes US Proposal; Disarmament Issue Assigned to the Armaments Commission for Study</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 10th] The Security Council on the 10th defeated the Soviet Union's recent proposal to reduce the armaments of the five major powers by one-third, and the US proposal to publicly report its atomic bomb stockpile. After listening to Soviet representative Malik's accusation on the afternoon of the 10th that the US was engaged in a "mad arms race" that would drag the world into a new war, the Security Council rejected the Soviet proposal by a vote of two against zero, with another vote abstaining.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Security Council passed the US proposal by a vote of nine against zero, with two abstentions, namely that the Security Council would transfer a resolution passed by the UN General Assembly last autumn to the Permanent Armaments Commission. According to this UN General Assembly resolution, the possibility of disarmament will not be discussed until the tense situation in the world ceases, but the Permanent Armaments Commission should first draft a plan to investigate the military facilities of various countries in order to study the issue of arms limitation.</p>
<h3>North Korea Submits Application Requesting to Join the United Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 10th] The North Korean government applied to join the United Nations on the 10th, but South Korea, supported by the United States, is recognized by most countries in the United Nations as the only legitimate government of Korea, and has already applied to join. In view of the fact that the UN General Assembly does not recognize the northern region of Korea, Secretary-General Lie only forwarded North Korea's application to the members of the Security Council for reference. North Korean Foreign Minister Baik Hong-yong (transliteration) stated in his application that the North Korean government "is willing to cooperate with other peace-loving countries to maintain peace and international security." North Korea's application seems that it will never be resolved by the Council, and South Korea's request will inevitably be vetoed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>North Atlantic Security Treaty Issue; US and Norway Hold Talks Again; US Refuses Military Aid to the Neutral Nordic Alliance</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 11th] Diplomatic authorities announced today that Norway has expressed to the United States its willingness to find a way to mediate the dispute between Sweden and the United States regarding Scandinavia's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty. Secretary of State Acheson held his final meeting with Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange today, and is expected to state the US position, provide facts, and answer Lange's questions regarding Norway's obligations and benefits after joining the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
<p>Regarding Sweden's proposal to establish a Scandinavian "neutral" defense alliance, the Secretary of State has refused and made it clear that such an alliance cannot hope to obtain US military assistance and advisors. However, Lange told Acheson during his visit four days ago that Norway fully sympathizes with the West in the Cold War between Western countries and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Matos Announces Withdrawal; Portuguese Presidential Election</h3>

Hours earlier, Vandenberg announced that he would retire from the political arena after his term in the Senate expires in 1952.</p>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief Tang Announced Five Principles for Maintaining Public Order Yesterday; The Public Should Not Panic Due to the Solidification of River Defenses</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch] General Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, held a reception for local figures and newspaper reporters at the New Life Club yesterday (11th) afternoon at 3:00 PM, where he immediately announced five major principles for maintaining the city's public order. He hoped that all citizens would abide by them and cooperate to ensure the stability of Shanghai's public order and society, and seek comprehensive and reasonable peace. Tang resolutely stated that the Yangtze River defenses are extremely solid. The National Army's shift to defend the river is not due to an inability to perform their duties, but to show the government's sincerity in seeking peace. If the Communist Party disregards this and insists on acting recklessly, attempting to cross the river and invade Beijing and Shanghai, it will be by no means easy. He claimed that the Communist army's pipe dream of crossing the river near Beijing and Shanghai will be shattered without exception. He particularly pointed out that the National Army's strength in defending Shanghai is more than sufficient, and will definitely not encounter the same fate as Changchun, Shenyang, Pingjin. Therefore, the citizens of the whole city really do not need to panic. Tang said in his speech that the government could not bear to see the people continue to suffer from the ravages of artillery fire. Since the President issued a message on New Year's Day and took the lead in retiring, Acting President Li has been striving for comprehensive peace with compromise. He, Tang, was ordered to guard the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, and acutely feels the importance of his responsibility. However, soldiers take obeying orders and defending the country and protecting the people as their duty. He vowed to do his best to protect the lives and property of the people. Especially Shanghai is an international city, and the center of our country's culture and economy, it is all the more important to strengthen defense, calm people's hearts, and seek to stabilize social order. He believes that today's China must ensure that the people can obtain genuine peace, genuine democracy, and genuine freedom, and enjoy the happiness of living and working in peace, and then China will have hope of rejuvenation. This is why he wholeheartedly supports Acting President Li's painstaking efforts to seek comprehensive peace, and his Shanghai compatriots agree with him without prior consultation. However, today's Shanghai is a martial law area close to the war zone, and social stability should be the first priority, and maintaining order is the most important. However, due to the large population and complex elements, there are unscrupulous people lurking and carrying out activities, and they often distort the government's painstaking measures, and use all kinds of tricks to sow discord, resulting in confusion in public opinion, rumors flying everywhere, people's hearts are floating, and order is also affected. Employees often gather crowds to coerce and make unreasonable demands, disregarding the law, and making a loud noise. They may cause trains to stop, streetcars to strike, or threaten their supervisors, and even obstruct traffic and affect public utilities, which harms the daily lives of millions of citizens. This phenomenon is not only his responsibility to correct and stop, but also deeply hated by all citizens of Shanghai. In fact, so-called democracy must require everyone to abide by the law, freedom must not harm the freedom of others, and peace must require jointly observing order. He is duty-bound to defend the country and protect the people, but the completion of the task depends on the sincere cooperation of people from all walks of life and all his comrades. Therefore, he specially invites you gentlemen to express your opinions and work together to overcome difficulties. He hereby provides the following items as the principles for all walks of life in the city to abide by at present:</p>
<p>(1) The statements and records in newspapers and publications must be based on correct facts, and no rumors or misrepresentations shall be made to confuse the public, and they must be based on stabilizing people's hearts and maintaining social order. All newspapers and publications that have been suspended shall not be resumed without the permission of the competent authorities. (2) The payment of workers' wages shall be handled in accordance with laws and customs, and no excessive or unreasonable demands shall be made. If there are any opinions on improving treatment, they must apply to the competent authorities for handling in accordance with the law, and there shall be no gathering of crowds to coerce, strike, slow down, or similar riotous acts. (3) School students should be considerate of the country's difficulties, use more reason, and not take actions that affect social order, so as not to be used by others and serve as a sacrifice. (4) People from all walks of life should know that the maintenance of social order and the security of public order are the responsibility of every citizen. Therefore, all actions must not violate martial law. For self-defense, relief, and condolences, it is hoped that wealthy citizens will generously donate and share the difficulties together. (5) The troops stationed in the city must strictly abide by the order on rectifying military discipline in Shanghai issued by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on February 8. Any violations will be severely punished without leniency, and it is hoped that citizens will assist in the inspection and maintenance of military discipline, so as to maintain social order.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Strikes and Other Behaviors, the Leaders Will Be Executed on the Spot; The Issue of Troop Housing Has Been Resolved Through Discussion</h3>
<p>Tang added to the point of prohibiting strikes and slowdowns, stating that he has ordered the garrison commanders in the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area that from now on, employees of any institution, regardless of the reason, are not allowed to have strikes, slowdowns, gatherings to coerce, or riotous acts. If such acts occur, they will be severely punished in accordance with martial law, and the garrison commanders in various places are authorized to execute the leaders on the spot in accordance with military law.</p>
<p>Tang said that regarding the issue of military discipline, he has studied improvements with Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and Chairman Fang. The two major difficulties currently affecting military discipline are the housing problem and the soldiers' food problem, which have now been gradually improved. Regarding the housing problem, because there is a shortage of barracks near Shanghai, it is inconvenient for the military to live in civilian houses, and it is also inconvenient for the military. A solution has now been decided. Those temporarily allowed to station troops include the following three types: (1) schools that have not yet started classes, (2) factories that have stopped work, and (3) vacant warehouses. In this way, it is believed that borrowing and living in civilian houses can be avoided. Regarding the problem of soldiers' food, because the soldiers' non-staple food expenses are meager and prices in Shanghai are high, it is difficult to maintain. From this month, the non-staple food expenses for soldiers in the Beijing-Shanghai area have been increased to 1,200 yuan, which is based on the standard of each person receiving two pounds of meat, two pounds of oil, and one pound of salt per month. In addition, firewood and vegetables have been decided by the municipal government to subsidize. Starting from today, with the resolution of the above two problems, it is believed that maintaining military discipline will not be a problem. He mentioned that Shanghai is the transportation hub of the country, and personnel evacuated from various places must pass through Shanghai. Military agencies coming to Shanghai may have deficiencies in management, which affect the relationship between the military and civilians. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters is trying to improve it as much as possible in order to achieve the ideal of not violating the slightest and maintaining peace between the military and the people.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Points Out the Hopes of the Citizens</p>
<p>The heads of various circles attending the reception included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Chairman Fang Zhi, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiyi, and about 200 people from various circles and newspaper reporters. After Tang's report, Mayor Wu took the floor and pointed out the common hopes of the citizens of the whole city, which are (1) that comprehensive peace can be realized, and (2) that Shanghai can obtain stability. Shanghai can do nothing about the former, but the latter is closely related to their own interests and should be worked hard together. However, he concealed that there are not a few people in the city who deliberately sabotage stability and take advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble. These people are the public enemy of the citizens of the whole city. Therefore, Commander Tang's announced five principles are to protect the safety and interests of the public, and we should unanimously support and abide by them, and request Commander Tang to strictly enforce them. Chairman Fang delivered a speech, providing two points of view: (1) Eliminate the conspirators who are engaged in sabotage and sow discord, and (2) All citizens should immediately contribute money if they have money, and donate materials if they have materials, to comfort the armed soldiers.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan Suggests Strengthening Comfort to the Troops</p>
<p>Speaker Pan delivered a speech, first expressing his feelings, saying that after listening to Commander Tang's words, it can be seen that the central and local governments have completely consistent views on seeking comprehensive peace. He also suggested that the work of comforting the troops should be strengthened immediately. Only by being able to fight can there be peace, but surrender is absolutely not allowed. Pan praised the hard work and tenacious spirit of the army and people of Taiyuan under the leadership of General Yan Xishan, which is worth emulating by the citizens of Shanghai. He said that Beijing and Shanghai are the heart of the country and must not be shaken. Therefore, he advocated that in order to consolidate Beijing and Shanghai, a certain percentage of the taxes paid by the citizens of Shanghai should be extracted as the cost of consolidating Beijing and Shanghai, and every penny should be used on the soldiers, so that the soldiers can get the best enjoyment, so that morale will be greatly boosted, and they can fight and make peace.</p>
<p>Answer Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>Finally, Commander Tang stood up again to deliver a speech and answered the written questions raised by reporters. Tang said: (1) The combat effectiveness of the army must be cultivated with spirit and material. Therefore, in the future, he will try his best to improve the treatment of the army and ask the central government to increase it. (2) Regarding the issue of stabilizing prices, he will invite relevant agencies and experts to discuss methods in the near future. (3) The matter of soldiers living in civilian houses in Zhabei will be handled by the Garrison Department. He has ordered a general inspection of the houses occupied by soldiers within a week, and such matters will gradually be reduced. (4) Regarding the construction project issue, whether it is for peace or war, the construction project is necessary. If Shanghai is not defended, it will not have the qualifications for peace. The expenses of the construction project are all borrowed from the Central Bank, without using a penny of local money, and some businessmen take the opportunity to raise the prices of the materials needed for the construction project, which is really inappropriate. Tang also cited the suffering of the people in Northeast China and Beiping Jinan and other places recently, which can serve as a lesson for people in other places. Tang concluded this reception with the words "I am determined to serve the people of Shanghai, to serve the interests of all the citizens of Shanghai, and Shanghai will be able to maintain permanent freedom and integrity."</p>

Currently, all local management banks have uniformly started to handle the settlement according to the newly ordered multiples since yesterday, but those who have settled early before the implementation of the amended regulations will no longer be paid in multiples.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Again Set New Prices, Increasing Two and a Half to Three Times</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Lunar New Year, the prices of various commodities have risen sharply, especially the prices of American care oil, materials, and coal, which have increased more than fivefold, making it impossible for various public utility companies to maintain operations. They have successively requested the revision of new prices. The Public Utilities Bureau summoned the persons in charge of various companies for the past two days to conduct a thorough review of each company's income and expenditure situation and actual required costs. The two sides argued fiercely. The Public Utilities Bureau believed that while maintaining the company's operation was important, the burden on citizens must also be taken into consideration. After repeated negotiations, a solution was finally reached. The increase rate was two and a half to three times. After being submitted to the mayor for approval, water, electricity, gas, and telephone charges will be calculated based on meter readings starting today (the 12th), and public transportation will be implemented starting tomorrow (the 13th). The new prices are recorded in the table below:</p>
<p>Tap Water (per cubic meter)</p>
<p>Electricity (per unit)</p>
<p>Gas (per 100 cubic feet)</p>
<p>Within 10 units 190 yuan Above 10 units within the limit 320 yuan</p>
<p>Telephone (per call)</p>
<p>1-150 calls 25 yuan 151-300 calls 30 yuan</p>
<p>Above 301 calls 35 yuan</p>
<p>Public telephone per call 30 yuan</p>
<p>Tram</p>
<p>First class 30 yuan 40 yuan 50 yuan 60 yuan 70 yuan</p>
<p>Third class 20 yuan 30 yuan 35 yuan 40 yuan 45 yuan</p>
<p>Public Bus</p>
<p>30 yuan 45 yuan 60 yuan 70 yuan 80 yuan 90 yuan</p>
<p>Ferry</p>
<p>Across 25 yuan Long ferry 20 yuan per nautical mile</p>
<p>Small Railway</p>
<p>10 yuan per kilometer per person</p>
<p>The method of unit calculation is still under research</p>
<p>[Another Report] Each public utility company calculates the price adjustment each time based on the current cost. However, due to the rapid devaluation of the currency, it quickly becomes inaccurate and suffers greatly. Therefore, a unit calculation method has been proposed to the municipal authorities to reduce the losses caused by the devaluation of the currency. It is reported that this method is being carefully studied by the competent authorities.</p>
<p>Regarding the request of machine workers in the Pudong district to change their wages to rice, the Social Affairs Bureau stated that this matter involves too much and is practically difficult, so it does not intend to mediate.</p>

<h3>Some Schools Adopt Inferior Practices, Rush to Collect Tuition Fees and Collect Rice After the Deadline; The Education Bureau Strictly Prohibits Such Practices; Parents Can Report</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Education Bureau received letters from students' parents reporting that tuition fees are high this semester and parents bear a heavy burden. Some schools are rushing to collect fees, and if parents fail to raise the money in time, the school will collect white japonica rice instead. This practice has never happened before. The person in charge of the Education Bureau said yesterday that this situation is absolutely not allowed. The fee standards for this semester were previously agreed upon by Mayor Wu, senators, and school principals. The Education Bureau has issued an order to all schools to strictly comply. If any overcharging is discovered, parents can report to the Education Bureau, and the Bureau will send personnel to investigate thoroughly. If the report is true, the school will be ordered to dismiss the principal.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Recently, various schools in the city have set deadlines for paying fees, resulting in the situation where the children of employees of various bureaus and offices of the municipal government have been denied enrollment. Li Ximou, Director of the Education Bureau, made a special statement yesterday, saying that the request for free education for the children of municipal government employees should be limited to direct relatives, that is, their own children. If the payment of tuition and miscellaneous fees is delayed due to raising funds, schools should allow them to enroll first and postpone the payment of fees until the end of this month, and should not cancel their places on the pretext of the deadline. Regarding the issue of free education for the children of journalists, the authorities have made careful consideration. The principle of free education is no longer a problem. However, whether it is fully free or half-free has not been decided. In addition, the opening of schools in the garrison area has been scheduled for 3 p.m. on the 12th, when a meeting will be convened with the principals of the schools in the garrison area to discuss and decide.</p>

<h3>National Peace Promotion Association to Open Today at the Senate; President and Vice President Invited Senators Yesterday to Solicit Opinions</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The National Peace Promotion Association is scheduled to open at 2 p.m. today at the Shanghai Municipal Senate Hall on Tanggu Road. As of yesterday, delegates from the Senate of various provinces and cities had reported to Shanghai from sixteen units. More than ten people are still on the way. Other representatives of national professional groups who have reported have also exceeded a dozen units.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan and Xu Jikui, President and Vice President of the Municipal Senate, held a tea party at the Senate at 10 a.m. yesterday to invite all senators in the city. More than 30 people attended. President Pan presided over the meeting and first reported on the government's efforts to seek peace since the New Year and explained the significance of convening the National Peace Promotion Association. He hoped that all senators would express their opinions on the peace talks as much as possible, so that they could be summarized and submitted for reference at today's meeting. Then Senators Yan E'sheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Tong Xiang, Zhou Lianze, Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran, and others successively delivered speeches, speaking enthusiastically about the issue of promoting peace. They unanimously believed that under the current circumstances, peace is the most urgent need of the people of the whole country, and the power of the people must be thoroughly promoted to achieve it as soon as possible. Some senators also expressed that those who participate in the peace movement must abandon their own interests and take striving for the welfare of the entire people as a prerequisite. President Pan also hoped that the people in the territories ruled by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could communicate their opinions and form a truly decisive force for peace. The tea party lasted for more than two hours and did not end until 12:30 p.m. At 6 p.m., Qian Xinzhi, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jikui, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Xiaolai and other six people jointly hosted a banquet at the Lido Garden to entertain representatives from all over the country who came to Shanghai to participate in the National Peace Promotion Association and exchanged preliminary views.</p>
<p>The President's Report: Significance, Tasks, and Opinions Must Be Consistent</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from President Pan's speech: President Pan said: The convening of the National Peace Promotion Association is of great significance and importance. We must seek consistency of opinion from the standpoint of the people. The Senate of seven provinces and cities in Hubei has replied to our Association by telegram, deciding to send the resolutions of the Association to Shanghai for reference. We hope that the senators of our city can also actively express their opinions, and after my colleague, Vice President Xu, and I carefully sort them out, submit them to the conference for discussion. The guests invited to this conference are the presidents and vice presidents of various provinces and representatives of people's organizations, so they can more represent public opinion. At this conference, representatives from all over the country will surely express valuable opinions, and we hope to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>The First Need for Peace Talks is to Uncover the Iron Curtain and Communicate the Opinions of the People in the Two Regions</p>
<p>Peace is, of course, something that everyone hopes to achieve, but the specific methods for seeking peace still need to be discussed by representatives sent by the government and the Chinese Communist Party. I believe that the biggest difficulty in peace talks is that the people in the areas of the central government and the people in the areas of the Communist Party are still unable to make contact. Until now, we have not heard the people in the Communist areas issue a call for peace. Do they not want peace? Therefore, I believe that the first need for peace talks is to find a way to uncover this "iron curtain" so that the people in the two regions can communicate with each other and the people in the Communist areas can truly express their opinions and exert their potential, then peace will naturally come to fruition.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 11th] Regarding the matter of sending representatives to participate in the National Peace Promotion Association convened in Shanghai, the Taiwan Provincial Senate recently resolved that it was too late to receive the notification and could not send personnel to participate. However, the Senate has always supported the promotion of peace and is willing to work together.</p>

<h3>30 Million in Compensation for the Jiangya Case Entrusted to the Ningbo Association for Distribution; Japanese Salvage Expert Returns Home Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] On the ninth day of this month, family members of the passengers who died in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s Jiangya ship went to the company to petition.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The 38-year Short-Term Gold Public Bonds were started to be sold by the Central Bank yesterday. The selling price is based on the foreign exchange transfer certificates and market prices, and the quotations are listed daily by the Open Market Committee. Yesterday's price was 52,252 yuan per tael.

<h3>Overall Loosening of Credit</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange Certificates Once Surpassed the Thousand Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Banking and financial sources revealed that the city's money supply increased significantly yesterday due to the large-scale distribution of military pay, which was supplied to foreign countries. The influx of northern capital was also a contributing factor. At present, the total amount of floating capital in the city has always been maintained above 5 billion yuan, and it is almost impossible to withdraw it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the credit in the city turned loose across the board. Industries were able to circulate easily due to the influx of orders. The transactions in the vegetable and rice industries were particularly frequent. The interbank lending rate fell to 40 to 50 yuan per thousand yuan per day, and the loosening trend became more obvious near noon.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to work as usual, and the withdrawal of cash became normal, and there were fewer restrictions by the banks, so the situation was stable and flat. It is said that a large number of gold yuan currency from the north has been flowing south in recent days, so there is a phenomenon that the cash outside the industry is more abundant than that inside the industry.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the foreign exchange transfer certificate market opened strong, mainly stimulated by the black market price, which has surpassed the thousand yuan mark. Later, the market price softened slightly due to the Central Bank's strong selling at high prices. In addition, the interbank credit turned tighter, and the commercial designated bank in the afternoon market bid 960 yuan and offered 980 yuan, up 90 yuan from yesterday.</p>

<p>The cotton cloth market opened high yesterday morning. Because floating capital from other cities continued to flow in, the credit situation turned loose, and there were frequent rumors of empty positions. People's hearts were unanimously prosperous, the local merchants were very tight, and the foreign customers also took the opportunity to enter, and the prices of various cloths soared.</p>
<p>The price of fine Longtou cloth was raised to 11,000 yuan outside the market.

<h3>Fuel Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the Lunar New Year, various types of local bituminous and anthracite coal have experienced a frenzied surge in prices, with all grades reaching unprecedented peaks. Factories of all sizes, public utilities, and citizens of both rich and poor are all facing severe threats. A reporter from the Commercial Press, after inquiring with those familiar with the coal market yesterday, learned that the soaring prices of bituminous and anthracite coal per catty were purely man-made. It is said that some large households have repeatedly used old tricks, creating rumors and mischief, or even manipulating and monopolizing the market to raise prices and seek profits, resulting in a reduction in the supply of spot goods in the market, causing people to be anxious, and ultimately the market price being illegally raised. The reporter also learned from another source that although the source of bituminous and anthracite coal catty has been slightly blocked, the inventory in this city is still abundant and there has been no shortage. Moreover, factories and users have tried to save on expenses due to high market prices, so the amount of fuel consumption has also been reduced. Therefore, the high cost of coal is purely an illegal price increase, and the future is really unimaginable.</p>
<p>According to the Four Mines Joint Operating Office: yesterday, the price of bituminous coal was adjusted again. The price list is as follows: domestic bituminous coal is 15,500 yuan per ton, and foreign bituminous coal has dropped alone, at 28,593 yuan per ton, a decrease of 953 yuan compared to the previous time. Anthracite coal nuggets and small pieces are both 27,000 yuan per ton. Anthracite coal lumps are 36,000 yuan per ton, and anthracite coal dross is 19,000 yuan per ton. The above are all delivery prices at the Pudong wharf. Delivery at the Puxi Maigen Road coal yard requires an additional 900 yuan per ton.</p>
