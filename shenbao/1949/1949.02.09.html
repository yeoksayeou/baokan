<h3>滬代表團今晨飛古　團員三人預定勾留一週　邵力子抵滬決隨同北上</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市和平代表團定九日上午十時飛平。團員人選經昨日午後四時在顏寓會商後，再度更動，最後決定為顏惠慶·章士釗·江庸三人，歐元懷·凌憲揚·侯德榜均以健康或事務上之理由，臨時取消赴平計劃。和平老人邵力子氏，此次亦以私人資格前往。此外隨機赴平者，有李副總統友人黃啓漢氏，江庸之子江幼甫，秘書五人，醫生一人，隨從一人。代表團一行所乘者為中航專機，今晟自龍華機堪起飛，約定在北平西郊降落，並已獲得中共允許，准與西郊機塲用無綫電聯絡。留平時間預定為一週，可用無綫電話與南京保持聯繫。據有關人士透露：和平代表團赴平，帶有李代總統致中共諸領袖之函件。代表團留平之時間，愈長愈好，因時間越久，斷定收穫愈大。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕邵力子·甘介侯八日上午乘機飛滬，繼續與滬和平代表團顏憲慶，章士劍等交換意見。邵已決定以私人資格與顏等同機飛平，邵之私人秘書張豐胃亦將同往。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕邵力子昨晨與李代總統同機抵滬，定九日與和平代表團飛平。邵氏對北行任務，拒絕發表意見，僅謂，以私人資格與對方交換意見而已，留平日期，約為一週。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平八日電〕南京大學教授和平代表團團員，八日首次與此間共黨領袖接觸，非官方但可靠方面消息稱：南京代表團昨日下午會晤共黨軍事首領葉劍英將軍，葉氏吿此輩大學教授稱，上海代表團已允前來北平，然對華北軍政首領如何或何時接待顏使團或是否願意接受彼等之請求，則不發表任何意見·據稱，葉將軍曾暗示越快越好，但並不說明理由。南京代表團昨日下午曾離開所居住之六國飯店，返寓後，則拒絕與新聞記者討論談話內容。言點，正與葉將軍前所晴示討論內容不得向至少是外國及外界新聞記者論及一點吻合。據所知，與南京代表團同時飛平之中國記者仍滯留西苑機塲。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平八日電〕共方對南京和平代表十一人並不視為解决國事之可能工具。報載：軍事管理委負會主席葉劍英擬分別接見代表，與之純粹作私人談話，換言之，卽並不當作代表團看待。昨日葉氏曾接見該團代表三人，共方對該代表團似不十分重視，預料在顏惠慶率領之代表團未到達以前，整個局勢不致有切實進展。自右至左：邵力子，顏惠慶，章士釗，江庸。（太報攝）</p>
<h3>甘介侯對中共之攻擊　鄭重解釋係誤會　聲明並不灰心盼雙方忍辱負重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕甘介侯氏晨十時再度由京來滬，主持代表團赴平之準備工作。晚問接見記者，表示此來原擬邀請陳光甫，冷禦秋參與代表團北行，但午後四時在顏寓治商後，除顏·章·江三氏外，餘人各有各的困難，不能抽身前往。關於前晚陜北廣播中之攻擊，甘氏鄭重解釋稱：「過去一週內，與北平用長途電話聯絡，赴平本無問題，但因前次招待會中，本人說明和平代表團之任務乃在請中共早日決定和談之地點及時問，致遭受中共之批評。本人對此並不生氣，因為明瞭這是誤會，從而發生疑慮之故。至於和平攻勢之指責，我人有一百分的誠意，而中共亦屢次表示要縮短戰爭，减少人民的痛苦，故擊方之目的相同，我人亦相信中共對和平有誠意，在此情形之下，和平攻勢無從發生。同時，和平乃全民之要求，非美國之事，全民要和，美國憂無法阻撓，無所謂「美國之廉價商品」。本人現雖這受此種攻擊，但對和平之努力，並不灰心，個人雖略受委屈，但和平任務己有達成之可能，代表團之飛平，為時局上一大進展。和平乃全國人民之事，雙方不但應相忍為國，且須忍辱負重，為望中共對此能有諒解」。</p>

<h3>李代總統由京蒞滬　接見金融界請合作安定上海經濟　並與顏惠慶等有所洽商　何應欽今可能同行返京</h3>

<h3>穗房荒嚴重　租金以實物作價　地政局長有解釋</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州八日電〕自政府南移辦公後，穗市居民驟增，房屋租賃問題甚為嚴重，市地政局長李樸生，今對記者稱：自政府局部南移後，本市居民突為增加，除由市府協助各機關覓址辦公之外，而家眷來市者數仍不少，致房荒現象日益嚴重，業主藉此時機，苛索租值固屬不合，但邇來幣值波動急劇，如拘執於房屋租賃條例，則業主損失過大，自難怪業主不肯接受，故為保持業主於訂約時之實物價值，以弭爭端，此為急需解決之問題，故租金有主張用基數，有主張用米，事實上現以米為最多，照米市塲當日之價交付，較為公道，因政府租賃房屋已有用米。用外幣者，而處理人民爭端則打官話，良心亦覺滑稽，故政府必須正式承認此項事實始易處理，否則法律離事實太遠，自行不通。</p>

<h3>上海各學校的收費問題</h3>
<p>冬去春來，上海公私立各級學校屆臨開學的時候了。開學之前，各校呈現兩項嚴重的問題：一是學校駐紮軍隊，影響了開學；一是學校收費以食米為標準，加重了學生家長的負擔。前者屬於軍隊風紀與社會秩序問題，本與學校教育無關，但它可以影響教育。後者屬於教育制度問題，本與社會秩序無關，現在則可以構成社會問題。撤退學校駐軍問題，各學校紛作此項要求，至於現在究竟能否撤退和能否不妨礙開學，實在很難說。眼前橫在教育界的，特別是一般學生家長最感沉重的問題，當是學校收費的問題，頗引人注意；而昨天總算勉强解決了一部分的問題。</p>
<p>關於本學期各級學校收費的問題，大中小學當局已經有了比較具體的決定，而一部份市參議員也參加了意見。關於專科以上學校本學期收費標準，私立專科以上學校校長於一月十日集會時，就有了初步決定：專科學雜費以三石半食米計算，大學以四石半米價折合，均以一次收足為原則。另有一些大學校長，主張根據生活指數倍數收費，如聖約翰大同等則將本學期學程分為三期，聖約翰每期學雜費以底數三十二元乘生活指數，大同每期學雜費以底數三十一二元點三三乘生活指數，東吳則分學程為兩期，每期學雜費基數為四十八元。無論就生活指數，或照食米計算，本期專科以上學校的收費額，數字都很可驚。關於公私立中小學本學期收費標準，從去年底市參議會提供「下學期私立各學校學雜費額以實物折價，於繳淸後不得再有追收」以後，便為中小學以微食米為收費標準的便利，做了塡土舖路的工作。市教育局也不反對這個意見，祇希望收費額不可太高，增加淸寒學生家長的負擔。一個月以來，公私立中小學校長紛紛集會，討論收費標準，未得統一意見，由於開學時期迫切，二月五日市教育局召集的一次會議，纔勉强商定本學期的收費，以食米為標準，規定小學為七斗五升至一石五斗，初中為一石七斗五升至二石五斗，高中為二石二斗五升至三石。這如果成為定案，其數字之高，相差之巨，不僅令學生家長吃驚，甚至連一個研究教育學理的人，也感到這種微妙的運用，不是培植新生代的教育，而是摧殘這一代的教育。</p>
<p>教育是為時代服務，受教育是一種權利，這個最高的準則如有違反或偏差，關係社會的榮枯基重。無疑的，今天的教育，因為政府庫帑支絀，有賴於私立學校之襄助，流風所趨，使受教育幾乎形成了購買教育；這完全是商業社會商業教育的行徑。上海公私立各級學校經費困難，是一件事實問題，而學生家長的勞務所獲，能否負擔此沉重的學雜費，換言之，卽有否此種購買力，頗成疑問。因此，在大局萬分危難的今天，社會經濟情形又如此，在維持學校經費與顧全家長負擔兩方面，希望有一個妥善的救濟辦法，不宜硬性推行各校所擬議的食米收費標準。</p>
<p>何種辦法符合妥當輿救濟的原則，而又兩全其美，實需要教育學家和教育行政當局為教育的光彩着想，為學生家長負擔着想，，面對現實，多運智慧，求得一個公平合理的水準，减輒學費的微收，及放寬一次微收的尺度。昨天上午市政府召集私立中學校長所議定的收費額，規定為（一）小學收費六千五百元，初中一萬一千元，高中一萬五千元。（二）校方得分期收費，學生亦得申請分期繳費，但不得超過三期。（三）分期繳費者，小學以四十元為底數，初中以六十四元為底數，高中以九十元為底數，除所分期之次數，依照當期生活抬數繳納。大體看來，尙屬比較合理。因為（一）微收學雜費得分期繳付，以便利淸寒子弟的家長；（二）不採用食米的價格為標準，不致再牽動其他問題；（三）其所定的平均底數，按諸金圓兩元合戰前法幣一元之準則亦尙不為過高。但我們於此，還要補充三點。。（甲）對淸寒學生應予免費或半費，各校獎金的名額和優待淸寒學生的免費半費名額，應按照向例提升至最高比額。（乙）學校財政要公開，各校經費確實有困難的，市當局應酌予救濟。（丙）眞正歷史悠久成績優異的，市當局得酌許增收之成數，而聲譽不隹者，應核减其費額。（丁）他如富有的學生家長，也應各盡所能，慷慨捐輸，以援助學校與教師渡過當前的難關。</p>

<h3>世界裁減軍備問題　安理會重開辯論　預料蘇代表將提新建議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖八日電〕蘇聯代表馬立克可望在八日安理會會議中接受東西辯論世界裁軍問題。西方代表團正急切等待蘇代表演說，他們認為此項演說可能對史達林「和平攻勢」的次一行動透露端倪。馬立克及其助手並未對其有意發表演說之舉，作進一步的證實，但聯合國官員指出，預定對栽軍問題的討論，已兩度延期，俾馬立克獲有充分準備時間，美英均無意對此項問題發表意見，除非蘇聯提出新的指斥或新建議。鑒于史逹林最近提出美蘇逐步裁軍的建議，若干代表團認為蘇聯可能提出若千新的或修正的裁軍建議。在巴黎聯大會中。蘇聯的五强立卽裁軍三分之一以及同時廢止及摧毀原子武器的建議，以絕大多數的反對被否決。目前安理會中所待處決的問題，，則為西方國家以大多數壓倒蘇聯的抗議而通過的聯大決議，該項決議中認為，在目前國際關係不良的情狀下，裁軍係不可能者，僅規定由聯合國常規軍備委會重新討論理論上的裁軍，以待國際關係好轉時實施。由於最近克林姆宮發出的和平提議，馬立克或將對已被拒絕的裁軍三分之一的計劃，提出若千修正，但其結果，仍不過為雙方唇舌交加，激辯一塲。對裁减軍備軍隊及軍事預測，不致有任何具體步驟，在目前裁軍，顯然與西方武裝西歐聯盟及簽訂北大西洋防衛公約，以防止共產主義侵略的計劃相衝突。</p>
<h3>美繼續援歐復興　要求撥款五十五億八千萬元　艾契遜霍夫曼出席國會作證</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕參院外委會主席康納利七日提出議案，要求對歐洲復興計劃繼續作十五個月的財政援助，自本年四月至一九五〇年六月為止。於此一時期內經合總署之用款，將撥付五十五億八千萬元。但渠警吿稱，「歐洲必須盡其本位努力」，俾使此項計劃成功。衆院外委會主席勃魯姆亦在衆院提出類似議案。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓八日廣播：美國務卿艾契遜本日出席兩院外委會作證稱，歐洲復興計劃成就之一，卽為歐洲方面集體安全之顯著進步</p>
<p>白魯塞爾公約為簽約國決心維護其獨立與自由，以抵抗外來侵略之露骨表不，對於增强復興工作所必需之安全心理，已發生軍大之影響。美國熱烈歡迎此公約，視為復興之重要貢獻。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕經合總對長霍夫曼八日對參衆兩院外委會稱，「雖然經濟援華亦為經合總署責任之一，但在目前聽取歐洲復興計劃之時，吾人不將提出關於中國的建議。」霍夫曼繼稱，「在目前急速動盪的局勢下，在不穩定地區經濟援助，正在逐日進行的基礎上繼續，臨時性的建議，及若干對援華法案本身的修正建犧，將在嗣後提出國會，以待考慮。」渠並稱，關於援韓初步計劃，亦將在四月一日前提出。霍夫曼宣稱，「歐洲已經過經濟復興第一階段，在當前數月中，必須把握住關於推行歐洲在世界中消費其本身金錢的傳統而現在已不適宜的方式的主要調整更困難的問題。」霍夫曼頓促國會繼續執行歐洲經濟復興，渠估計在以後五個月中，將需要五十五億八千萬美元。</p>
<p>兩院外委會顯然表示同情，渠等的批准似己不成問題。霍夫曼稱譽受援國家在經合總署第一年度工作中關於復興方而的進步，並宣稱不必為歐洲經合辦公處最近陰黯的報吿而過份悲觀。渠稱，該項報吿並非對未來失敗的預測，而係對目前的弱點的診斷，俾能在合作的再調整中發現挽救方法。該報吿中僅稱，照目前形式下分開的復興計劃，將不能在四年中使歐洲自給自足。鑒於歐洲經合辦事處此項結論，卽可考慮使分開的國別性的計劃，得以改變及整體化的方式。</p>
<h3>授權杜魯門總統　改組行政機構</h3>

<h3>全國和平促進會　延至十二日舉行　籌備會決議與漢口聨擊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市參議會發起之全國和平促進會，於昨午三時，假塘沽路二九五號舉行籌備會議，商討召開大會之進行步驟。出席議長潘公展，副議長徐寄廣，江蘇省參議會黃森，龐甸材，河南省參鐵會張鴻烈，北平市參議會鄧萃英，遼寗省參議會張偉光，石堅，潘陽市參議會王書麟，張世良，山東省參議會製嗚宇，安徽省參議會徐文彬，全國商聯會王曉籟，籌景偉，趙棣華，全國汽車業宣傳京，中國婦女會莊靜，呂曉道，熊淑衡，王立文，全國糧商會萬墨林，全國西醫師會覃勸，中醫師會金誦盤，中國幼幼協會羅春基，全國會計師公會孔繁枬，何元明等計十八單位代表二十八人。卽將飛北平與中共談和之六代表，因李代總統於昨晨抵滬，邀集彼等交換意見，時間衝突，均未列席，僅凌憲揚一人曾到達會塲，簽名後卽匆匆離去。</p>
<p>昨日籌備會由潘公展主持，主席致詞後，繼由各地代表紛紛發言，一致決議三項如下：（一）迅卽電請漢口七省市和平促進會將該會擬具之和平意見，派代表飛滬提出共同商討，並卽以長途電話與漢口七省市和平促進會取得聯絡。（二）上海之和平促進會，決延遲至本月十二日舉行。（三）公推上海市參議會副議長徐寄廎為大會臨時主席。</p>
<p>茲將昨日籌備會中潘議長及各地代表所發表意見分誌如下：</p>
<h3>潘議長致開會詞　堅守人民立塲　為人民減痛苦</h3>
<p>潘議長致開會詞，並報吿一個月來國共間政治變化之經過略稱：「今年一月八日，上海市參議會發出促進和平之通電，業經全國各省市參議會及全國性職業團體一致熱烈響應，可見全國人民祈求和平之心切，上海市參談會願負起籌備召開和平促進會之責任，各地代表亦已陸續抵滬，迄今恰為一個月。此一月間，中共廣播及中央派遣和談代表等各種措置，千變萬化。惟和平促進會將始終站在人民立塲，謀為人民减少戰事痛苦，本會之召開，實有關全國同胞今後之生活與性命，各位皆係遠道而來，望能儘量發表意見，俾達到和平之目的。」</p>
<p>河南</p>
<p>省參議會副議長張鴻烈致詞略稱：一和平是人人希望的，唯有和平以後，大家才能安居樂業。但是我們需要的是眞正的和平，最低限度要保障身體·職業·和居住的自由。」</p>
<p>北平</p>
<p>市參議會代表鄧萃英致詞略稱：「本人記為中國到現在還不能和平，除了國共雙方必須負資之外，人民也有責任。如果人民平就愛好和平，國共一定打不起來。記得當初兄弟在北平時，接到上海呼籲和平的電報，當卽熱烈響應，曾在中山公園專誠設立辦事處，以待和平工作之進行，惜上海以後就此無聲無臭了。我們總覺得上海接近政府，所以忽視了我們渴望的和平，如果在一年半載之前，上海的先知先覺者早就倡導和平，則北方決不致遭受如此重大損失。這實是人民本身的羞恥，但現在趕緊召開和平促進會，為時尙不算晚，希望國家一天得不到和平，本會就一天不停其促進工作。」</p>
<p>山東</p>
<p>省參議會議長裴鳴宇致詞略稱：「勝利以來，如果國共雙方都在生產建設上競爭，到現在中國已進步到不可思議的地步，可惜內戰發生，致人民精疲力竭，痛苦萬分，現在是人民覺醒時際，願大家共向和平大道上邁進，則中國還有光明燦爛的希望。」</p>
<p>瀋陽</p>
<p>市參議會代表致詞略稱：「兄弟離開潘陽時，潘陽還未淪陷，到現在來參加此和平促進會，不知有沒有做代表的資格，我覺得共軍應先停止軍事行動，這樣和談才能成功。」</p>
<p>熱河</p>
<p>省參議會議長王致雲致詞略稱：「上海有一個全國性的和平促進會，同時湖北也有一個全國性的和平促進會，我們同時接到兩張電報，不知到底參加那一個好，希望雙方先坂得聯緊，不要有分裂的現象。」</p>
<p>和平為目的救命為口號</p>
<p>全國商聯會王曉　致詞略稱：「人民需要和平，已到了喊救命的時候，不管那一個是善政，那一個是惡政，人民都不願自已殘殺目己的，現在我們召開此次和平促進大會。應以和平為目的，救命為口號。」</p>
<p>全國西醫公會覃勤致詞略稱：「三民主義的國民黨政府，自北伐以來，始終沒有達到解決民生問題的目的，如果本身還保持現狀，要求和平是不可能的。」</p>
<p>中國婦女團體聯合會代表莊靜致詞略稱：「人民都愛好和平，尤其是婦女更愛好和平，因為婦女總脫離不了家庭，而和平生活是快樂家庭的基礎。自古以來婦女從來沒有發動過戰爭，不過我們覺得像北平那樣的和平是變相的投降，中共擋駕上海的代表是不民主的表現。」</p>
<p>最後由全國中醫師公會代表金誦盤致詞略稱：「上海有和平促進會，湖北也有和平促進會，可見中國人意見紛歧，精神還不能集中，我們應速電湖北七省市的和平促進會，請他們來開會，否則我們全體飛到湖北去開會。</p>
<h3>渝市參議會　路遠不參加</h3>
<p>〔中央社電慶八日電〕渝市參會各常設委會今舉行聯席會議，決定對於滬漢兩地所發起之和平促進會，以路遠為辭，均不參加。</p>
<p>〔本報蘭州八日電〕省參會已推派正副議長前往參加上海和平會議。</p>
<h3>修理機塲困難多　滬漢班機難復航</h3>
<p>中國中央兩航空公司滬漢棧班機停航，巳逹兩月之久，據兩公司悉。該綫班機短期內仍難望恢復，滬漢綫之停航，並無特殊關係，因用作民航飛機上洛之武昌機場，年久失修，致塲地及跑道高低不平，飛機上落時頗多困難，天雨更屬危險，而修理費用浩大，當地政府又無法籌款修平，雖有小規模之修理工作，但均屬無濟於事，故民航滬漢綫短期內仍難復航。</p>
<h3>公路總局運輸處　添開錫滬直達車</h3>
<p>公路總局為適應旅客需要，自今日起，添開上海無錫間對號直達客車，每日上午九時，由錫滬兩地對開一次，旅客威稱便捷。上海售票處有廣東路八六號第一運輸處，及虬江路八六五號該處上海站兩處，無錫可由該地第一運輸處錫站登記。聞前往登記者已頗踴躍。</p>
<h3>長江航綫復航　江順輪今駛漢</h3>
<p>招商局江順輪定九日下午一時由滬啓椗赴漢口，中途停靠安慶與九江，該局滬漢綫停航已將兩週，故江順輪之開航，是為該局新春以來第一艘長江航輪。蓋自國軍由江北撤退至江南後，航輪對長江綫視為畏途，江順輪若行駛通暢，招商局及其他輪船公司卽可恢復長江綫之航務。</p>
<h3>華南綫正常輪期　廿日後可望恢復</h3>
<p>招商局自華北航綫停頓後，其所有行駛滬津綫之特快客輪元培，秋瑾，及錫麟輪等，卽改航華南綫，並規定班期，行駛滬慶，滬汕，滬穗等專綫。茲悉：目下華南綫特快輪班期，又吿混亂，因政院各部會由京來滬遷穗時，大多租用該三艘特快輪，因此華南各綫正常班期，均無法維持，唯政院遷穗工作，已至最後階段，預料華南各綫在本月廿日之後，可望恢復正常航班。</p>

<h3>敎部同仁聨誼會　舉行首次幹事會</h3>
<p>再電代部長請發救濟費</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕教部在滬同仁聯誼會，於昨日上午十時，在復興中路國立上海高級機械職業學校內，舉行首次幹事會，討論各事如下：（一）決議本部同仁到滬之登記期限，至本月十五日截止，尙未登記者，應速登記。（二）決議除再電穗陳代部長請發在滬同人生活救濟費外，並推舉程時煃，劉英士，鍾道贊，郝更生，黃問歧，滕仰支，李觀高，王萬鐘，東薪吾等訪晤朱前部長，請代電陳代部長，迅予匯款救濟。並請朱前部長設法將中研院之屋，假為同人居住之所。（三）推督學徐達行，鄒湘喬，與市教局李局長接洽安挿到滬同人子弟入學與免費優待事宜，並定卽日起在復興中路一一九五號開始登記，以便彙總申請。（四）決議本月十一日上午十時，續開第二次幹事會。</p>

<h3>市立補習學校　一律收一千四</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市教育局昨日上午召開市立補習學校校長會議，出席李局長，孫科長，及曹鳳山，陸爾强，張使等十餘人，討論本學期收費標準，議決高初中一律收雜費一千元，講義費四百元。各校定於本月十四日招生開學。</p>
<h3>私校收費標準　決照指數計算　小學最高六千五　初中最高一萬一　高中最高一萬五　一次繳付為原則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全滬學生家長關心之私校收費問題，昨日已獲決定。吳市長於昨晨十時在市府會議室召開座談會，出席吳市長·潘議長·教同李局長及參議員與各校校長等九十餘人。首由李局長報吿前次會議經過，繼參議員張中原·陳公達·姜豪等分別發表意見，均主張學費應以職工生活指數為標準，以米折合，殊不合理，否則工人亦欲繼起以米計算工資，整個社會安定將受影饗。經熟烈討論結果，決定私校本學期收費額以生活費指救為標準。依據戰前收費標準，私小二十元，初中卅二元，高中四十五元，折合金圓券基數，為私小四十元，初中六十四元，高中九十元。因二月份上期指數尙未發表，而學校開學在卽，决定就一月份下期指數加八成計算，小學最高不得超過六千五百元，初中最高不得超過一萬一千元，高中最高不得超過一萬五千元，以一次繳付為原則。凡公教人員子弟曁家境確為淸寒之學生，均可申請分期付費，但所以二期或三期為限，不得超出三期，按分期比例以基數二分之一或三分之一乘當時生活指數照繳。</p>
<h3>歸僑顏料廠　鍋爐爆炸　壓死工程師　兩工人重傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閘北宋公園路一三四四號歸僑顏料廠，昨日上午十一時三十分許，因該廠夾層鍋受熱過度，突然爆炸，當塲死傷三人，死者為工程師劉恭杜（蘇州人廿五歲），因劉驟聞轟然一響，知有變故，急奔往將馬達關閉，詎上層屋宇受震後，屋頂坍下，將左脚壓斷，內臟重傷，氣絕身死。傷者為工人何妙章（卅一歲），遍體灼傷殊重，廠房坍下計一間。閘北一二三段救火會據報，卽驅皮帶軍馳往施救，將死者及兩傷人送市立第四醫院，屍體後轉常德路騐屍所候驗。</p>
<h3>鐵路工潮　火車停駛　工人爭待遇包團管理局　當晚協議三點暫告段落　客貨運價十一日起調整應付薪津</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路管理局工人，因要求改善待遇，於昨日下午二時許，突然發生工潮。京滬·滬杭兩綫各班列車完全停駛。路局工務處·機務處·及上北總站等各單位工人千餘人一度包劃管理局，迭成緊張形勢。總務處副處長陳奮克亦於混亂中被毆。後經淞滬警備司令部稽查處處長何龍慶率領警備隊趕到，驅散工人，並居間調解，至傍晚八時許，始吿一段落。龍頭房工人表示願意恢復工作，惟尙待與其他部份員工配合，故復工並未十分順利，僅於八時五十分有京滬綫第五次車到站外，至深夜十時半尙無其他列車進出。如今日不再有新阻碍發生，交通可望恢復正常。至於目前員工待遇之菲薄，王兆槐局畏深表同情，故於昨日局務會議中毅然決定，兩路客貨運售價，於本月十一日起自動調整，（按以前火車漲價須行政院通過），其收入除煤斤費用及必需材料外，一概作為負工薪津，卽今後員工薪給將隨客貨運價同時自動調整。</p>
<p>此次路局工潮係由戚墅堰機廠工人首先發動，綠本月四日局方徇工會要求提前發給本月份米貼，決議照當日市塲三等白粳價加一成折合金圓每石五千三百九十元。當時工方亦感滿意，但翌日米價暴漲，戚墅堰廠工人乃於前日提出異議，並臥軌攔車，提出五項要求：（一）補發一月份雙新。（二）五千三百九十元作借支，再發食米一石。（三）發米二石作為應變費。（四）發米五石作家屬疏散費。（五）以後薪津按米計算。戚廠糾紛昨經蘇州指揮所司令周喦調解，每人暫先發給食米二斗，餘待管理局統一調整辦法之實施。</p>
<h3>搗毀警察所刧出被拘者</h3>
<p>昨日下午二時許，本市路局各單位工人紛紛向路局廣塲集合，謂響應戚廠工人來滬請願，並喊叫停工。兩綫交通立卽陷於停頓。一時工人越緊越多，幾達千人以上。但當時旣無代表，亦無要求，經工會理事及王兆槐局長，處長王雲蓀，副處長陳奮克等竭力勸道無效。其時適有交通部小汽車一輛欲外出，工務處晒圖伕名王忠鄉者，為首擱住汽車，將輪胎放氣。路局警務處認為王有擾亂秩序嫌疑，將染拘逮暫扣局中直轄警所擬加詢問。王被拘後，羣衆大起騷動，竟衝至警所搗毀門窗，將王劫出，並將看守王忠卿之路警韓奎林毆傷。王出警所後，謂彼在警所被用電刑，受傷甚重。羣衆聞言大起衝動，情緒激昂，叫喊衝向大樓。守衛警士見形勢緊張，立卽分散，撲地持槍待發。</p>
<h3>客車午夜恢復行駛</h3>
<p>最後消息：京滬綫八十四次東於昨深夜十一時卅分開出，此為工潮發生以後客車恢復行駛之第一列。</p>
<p>（又訊）昨日京滬綫軍車亦受工潮影響一度停駛，軍人不明原委，誤為路局有意刁難，因而常州，崑山等站均曾發生毆打站長事件。</p>
<p>兩路局發生罷工，警備部何龍慶處長調解時情形（本報攝）</p>
<h3>十餘人團歐陳奮克受傷</h3>
<p>在此千鈞一髮之際，總務處陳　陳奮克受傷副處長奮克，奔下樓梯挺身於兩者之問，以緩和形勢避免發生慘案。混亂中有人呼打，陳副處長卽於此時被十數工人團毆，腰背面部受傷。惟羣衆終於受陳副處長之感動而停止衝向大樓企圖，但此時形勢依然緊張，受傷之路警韓奎林被抬至工人俱樂部「公審」。五時廿分，淞滬警備司令部稽查處何龍慶處長率領警備大隊武裝士兵趕到，驅散廣塲上工人，並赴工人俱樂部制止工人違法行動，解救韓奎林。此時羣衆中盛傳王忠卿因被電刑傷害過重，已死於中美醫院。警務處負責聲明並未用電刑，且警務處根本無此項設備，王之手部流血，實係工人搗毀警所時彼用拳擊玻璃窗所擦破，絕不致死亡。</p>
<h3>待遇問題　直接談判</h3>
<p>經何處長請解後，成立協議三點：（一）雙方各派代表至中美醫院騐看王忠卿是否死亡或曾否受刑。（二）立卽恢復交通。（三）待遇問題推代表與王局長直接商談。當時在塲工人對此三點咸表贊同，工人代表等立卽出發赴中美醫院，當經查明，王曾於西時許自行投院騐傷，騐得左手腕等部受切傷，表皮破損，傷勢甚輕，經包紮後出院，並曾由中美醫院出給傷單證明。一而工會理事晋見王局長，王局長以極誠懇之熊度，吿以局務會議中對自動調整運價及同時調整待遇之決議。惟兩路員工衆多，機構複雜，約需一週後始可算出待遇調整程度，並允今日會同會計，審計查算庫存現金，先發若干，請工會理事轉達各部份工人，囑顧全國家及人民，儘先恢復工作。工會理事等於八時四十分辭出，一塲風波至此始吿一段落。</p>
<h3>市校收費標準　今待市長決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市立中小學收費標準，可於今日決定。昨日下午市立中小學校長在浦東同鄉會集會交換意見，李局長亦出席參加。對市校收費標準，李局長認為以不超過私校半數為原則，校長方面提出之數字則超出甚多，待今晨十時由李局長呈奉吳市長取決</p>

<h3>昨晚籃球聨賽　仁餘勝回力</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨下午五時半一塲回力在甲組賽中，又遭敗陣，仁餘打來極佳，以六十三比三十五擊敗回力，上半時三十四比十五，回力始終格格不入，無從發展，王存忠陳正淼葉雲山昨晚未能出塲，不無影響。開賽後，沈鵬舉托中，首開紀錄。徐仲已王槐庭雙中，仁餘聲勢煊赫，以六比零前領。回力以徐叔源入替魏戍，仍無法打開生路，反見仁餘暢所欲為，上半時完了，仁餘以三十四比十五佔先。休息再戰，回力形勢未見好轉，仁餘則前鋒活躍非常，回力僅賴曹志吉張浦支撑局面，五三比二十七相差一倍時，王永芳曹志吉三元連中，但五十三比三十三，比數仍相差二十分之鉅。回力大勢已去，球運不佳，屢投不入，終塲比數為六十三比三十五，回力慘敗於仁餘。</p>
<h3>江亞罹難者家屬　羣赴招商局請願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江亞輪慘案發生後，罹難者家屬曾組織委員會，數度向招商局要求賠償損害。去年廢歷年底，每一家屬，曾由局方各撥救濟費五千圓，前日該會復推代表赴招商局提出三項條件：（一）每一遇難旅客由局方給付賠償費自米一百石，（二）安葬費白米廿五石，（三）對於未撈獲屍體之家屬，棺木及衣殮費仍應折算照撥，經局方允於昨午四時答覆，各家屬於上午八時，先在林森東路四明公所停屍塲集合，九時許抵達寗波同鄉會二樓等候，直至下午四時，由局方派人答覆，僅允再付救濟費每名五千元，至賠償問題暫不考慮，迨查明責任後，再行磋商云云。經代表向各家屬報吿後，認為數字細微，均表不滿，一致議決前往招商局請願，由寒波同鄉會分批出發，警務當局據報後，除由老閘警分局加派大批員警外，總局方面，亦出動飛行堡壘，隨同保護。</p>
<h3>竊盜犯等疏散出獄　警局曾請從緩釋放　以免妨害社會治安</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海監獄昨日繼續疏散犯人共達一百卅二人，其中以盜匪居多，約六十餘人，其餘烟毒，漢奸，竊盜，殺人各種犯人均有，惟無一知名之士。警局曾函上海監獄，請對於盜匪，竊盜犯人，從緩釋放，以免妨害社會治安，如囚糧缺乏，警局願意貼補，監獄當局對此，認為疏散囚犯係奉司法行政部命令，警局貼補囚糧亦非妥策，仍決繼續疏散，惟對於保釋之盜匪竊盜等犯人，在釋放前均由監獄當局訓話，勉渠等改過自新，重作新民。</p>
<h3>立委販毒案宣判　王者賓處刑七年　被吿表示不服</h3>

<h3>貨物稅已經咯單位　員工要求救濟費</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市貨物稅局所屬各單位，一般職負薪津，自十月份迄今，月入僅數百元至千餘元，而新春以來，物價突飛猛進，戔戔之數，生活已瀕於絕境。最近員工乃聯會向局方提出要求，一次發給救濟金每人五萬元，並準備實行「無力工作，」以達到目的。昨日經該局局長召集代表商討後，允發每人一萬五千元，但職員方面以與要求相去甚逮，故大部份均拒絕領取，尙在僵持中。</p>

<h3>市商會召集同業公會商討　處理特種外幣存單　議決否認每美元合金圓七角九分</h3>
<p>上海市商會為財政部電復對於特種外幣存單處理補充辦法事，於昨日下午四時，召集進出口銅·錫·新藥·鐵業·鋼條·電器·毛紡織·搪瓷等有關十六同業公會討論。到陳貴生陳懋勛華洪濤葉序馨丁惠康傳隡才簫爾駿等二十餘人，嚴諤聲主席。先由主席報吿自輸管會公布特種外幣存單差別處理辦法後，本會曾召集各業詳加研討，結果認為處理辦法與原辦法距離頗遠。惟為顧全國庫困難起見，勉予接受，但對抵用技術，提出四點請求：</p>
<p>（一）請迅發特種外幣存單，（二）抵用自卽季起，不硬性規定為第八季，（三）特種外幣存單，照現行匯率發給金圓公債，應以發給時之現行匯率折換，不當硬性規定為每美元合金圓二十元，（四）金圓公億，印發需時，請援美金短期庫券辦法，先憑存單掉換公債收據。上項四點，由本會於去年十二月二十日分電行政院財政部，請予採納。茲於二月三日，接奉財部電復：（一）特種外幣存單正由央行趕發中，（二）抵用仍照院令，一律自第八季起。惟工業方面進口審核手續，可由輸管會加速辦理。（三）處理辦法第三款乙項，將存單掉發公債，如將來現行匯率變更，可照債票發行日「法定匯率」計算。（四）央行先發公債收據，原則可照辦，惟公債發行需時，收據塡發，技術上頗費斟酌，如原進出口商願折發現款，可由部呈院修正規定，改為一律照每美元等於法幣四七四·〇〇〇元折合金圓券，提高五倍，一次發給現款。部令囑將此點迅予答復，因此召集有關各業，討論如何答復云云。經到會者詳加研究後，卽議決：（一）差別處理辦法第三款乙項，存單換發公債，係明定照「現行匯率」發給，並非「法定匯率」。當時之現行匯率，註明為每美元合金圓二十元。現在此項匯率，早已不行，卽政府對於轍入貨品或輸出貨品之結匯，均照結匯移轉證計算，每美元合金圓券超過八百元，此為目前之「現行匯率」。政府收入外匯旣依此計算，對於淸償債務，何能仍照每美元二十元折合，應請財政部更正「法定匯率」字樣。將來存單換發公債，應照發給時之現行外匯移轉證價格折算。（二）存單折發現款，如照每美元等於法幣四十七萬四千元，再加五倍計算，則每美元僅合金圓券七角九分，計不及現市價一千四百份之一，亦不及現外匯移轉證一千份之一，且尙須由部呈院修正處理辦法，公文旅行，開會通過，均需時日，及至發給，至少尙須三個月，在通貨惡性膨脹之今日，三個月後，七角九分之值價如何，當更難想像。因此各業對於財政部依此折發現款辦法，萬難接受，應請政府仍按照發給金圓公價時之外匯移轉證價格，換回特種外幣存單。（三）查依照施行細則規定，特種外幣存單，應自卅六年十一月份起，分六季抵用，每季三個月，共十八個月，卽可抵用完竣，現距卅六年十一月，已有十六個月，差已抵用元竣，卽照市價匯率兌換國幣亦應兌發半數，不料遷延年半，尙不能有分文抵償，政府信用，喪失殆盡，言之痛心，今日欲以每美元折合金圓券七角九分給現，實出情理以外，務由市商會向財政部剴切陳詞，請財政部徐部長履行一涖任時維持價信之諾言，速發外幣存單，並照發給時之市價匯率’掉發公債，履行政府對契約行為之義務云。</p>
<h3>證交經紀人開會　討論復業辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證交昨已函經紀人公會，通知準於廿一日復業，並着各經紀人如期繳納保證金。經紀人公會當於昨日下午四時起，召開理監事聯席會議，由該公會理事長王乃徐主席。席問除報吿證交復業之通知後，卽開始討論，重要決議案二起：（一）經紀人保證金，現規定分價券股票兩種，各為卅萬金圓，其百分之四十為現金，其餘百分之六十，得以上市之政府債券或國營事業股票抵充。以上統限本月十六日前繳齊。公會意見，擬請將六成代用品之繳齊日期，延至本月底為止，因黃金公債尙無上市確期。又除國營事業股票外，望亦准搭用民營事業股票。關於四成現金，望能改用銀行保證替代。以上各點，擬辦就公函，請理事長王乃徐與證交當局接洽轉陳主管當局變通辦理。（二）經紀人公會，亟望證交今後直隷財工兩部主管，儘量保障證交及經紀人之合法權益，地方機構勿隨意千涉。</p>

<h3>Shanghai Delegation Flies to Gubei This Morning - Three Members Scheduled to Stay for a Week - Shao Lizi Arrives in Shanghai, Decides to Go North</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The city's peace delegation is scheduled to fly to Peiping at 10 a.m. on the 9th. The list of delegation members was changed again after a meeting at Yan's residence yesterday at 4 p.m., and the final decision was Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong. Ou Yuanhuai, Ling Xianyang, and Hou Debang all temporarily canceled their plans to go to Peiping due to health or business reasons. Peace elder Shao Lizi is also going this time in a private capacity. In addition, those who will fly to Peiping on the same plane include Mr. Huang Qihan, a friend of Vice President Li, Jiang Youfu, the son of Jiang Yong, five secretaries, one doctor, and one attendant. The delegation will travel on a China Aviation special plane, which will take off from Longhua Airport this morning and land in the western suburbs of Peiping. Permission has been obtained from the Chinese Communists to use wireless communication with the Xijiao Airport. The stay in Peiping is scheduled for one week, and wireless telephone communication can be maintained with Nanjing. According to relevant sources, the peace delegation is carrying a letter from Acting President Li to the leaders of the Chinese Communists. The longer the delegation stays in Peiping, the better, as the longer the time, the greater the harvest.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Shao Lizi and Gan Jihou flew to Shanghai by plane on the morning of the 8th to continue exchanging views with Yan Xianqing, Zhang Shizhao, and others of the Shanghai Peace Delegation. Shao has decided to fly to Peiping on the same plane as Yan and others in a private capacity, and Shao's personal secretary Zhang Fengwei will also go.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Shao Lizi arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the same plane as Acting President Li, and is scheduled to fly to Peiping with the peace delegation on the 9th. Shao declined to comment on the mission to the north, saying only that he was exchanging views with the other party in a private capacity, and the stay in Peiping would be about one week.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Peiping, 8th] Nanjing University professors, members of the peace delegation, made their first contact with Communist leaders here on the 8th. Unofficial but reliable sources say that the Nanjing delegation met with Communist military leader General Ye Jianying yesterday afternoon. General Ye told these university professors that the Shanghai delegation had agreed to come to Peiping, but did not express any opinion on how or when the military and political leaders of North China would receive the Yan mission or whether they would be willing to accept their request. It is said that General Ye hinted that the sooner the better, but did not explain the reason. The Nanjing delegation left the Six Nations Hotel, where they were staying, yesterday afternoon, and refused to discuss the contents of the talks with reporters after returning to their residence. This point coincides with General Ye's previous clear indication that the contents of the discussion should not be mentioned to at least foreign and outside journalists. It is understood that the Chinese journalists who flew to Peiping at the same time as the Nanjing delegation are still stranded at Xiyuan Airport.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 8th] The Communist Party does not regard the eleven members of the Nanjing Peace Delegation as possible tools for resolving national affairs. It is reported that Ye Jianying, chairman of the Military Control Commission, intends to meet with the representatives separately and have purely private talks with them. In other words, they are not regarded as a delegation. Yesterday, Ye met with three representatives of the delegation. The Communist Party does not seem to attach much importance to the delegation, and it is expected that the overall situation will not make substantial progress until the delegation led by Yan Huiqing arrives.

<h3>Gan Jihou Solemnly Explains the Communist Attack as a Misunderstanding - Declares He Is Not Discouraged, Hopes Both Sides Will Endure Humiliation and Bear Heavy Burdens</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Gan Jihou came to Shanghai from Nanjing again at 10 a.m. to preside over the preparations for the delegation's trip to Peiping. He met with reporters in the evening and said that he originally intended to invite Chen Guangfu and Leng Yuqiu to participate in the delegation's trip to the north, but after negotiations at Yan's residence at 4 p.m., everyone else except Yan, Zhang, and Jiang had their own difficulties and could not spare the time to go. Regarding the attack in the Shaanxi Northern Broadcasting the night before, Gan solemnly explained, "In the past week, we contacted Peiping by long-distance telephone, and there was no problem with going to Peiping, but because I explained at the previous reception that the task of the peace delegation was to ask the Chinese Communists to decide on the location and time of peace talks as soon as possible, I was criticized by the Chinese Communists. I am not angry about this, because I understand that this is a misunderstanding, which led to doubts. As for the accusation of a peace offensive, we have 100% sincerity, and the Chinese Communists have repeatedly stated that they want to shorten the war and reduce the suffering of the people, so the goals of both sides are the same, and we also believe that the Chinese Communists are sincere about peace. Under these circumstances, a peace offensive cannot occur. At the same time, peace is the demand of the whole people, not the business of the United States. If the whole people want peace, the United States cannot stop it, so there is no such thing as 'cheap American goods.' Although I am now being subjected to this kind of attack, I am not discouraged in my efforts for peace. Although I have suffered some grievances personally, the task of peace has the possibility of being accomplished, and the delegation's flight to Peiping is a major progress in the situation. Peace is the business of the whole people, and both sides should not only endure for the country, but also endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, and hope that the Chinese Communists can understand this."</p>
<h3>Huang Xuchu Arrives in Guangzhou</h3>

<h3>Cheng Siyuan and Weng Wenhao Will Fly Back to Nanjing from Taiwan Today</h3>
<p>Chen Cheng Has a Long Letter Entrusted to Cheng to Bring to Nanjing</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Taipei, 8th] Cheng Siyuan was invited to a luncheon by Lin Zigui at noon on the 8th, with many people from the press accompanying him. Mr. Cheng told reporters at the banquet that he had decided to fly to Shanghai and then to Nanjing with Weng Wenhao on a China Aviation plane on the 9th. Sun Lianzhong repeatedly declined and did not intend to return to Nanjing, and had a letter brought to Nanjing by Mr. Cheng to be presented to Acting President Li. The discussions with Chairman Chen have also come to an end. Chairman Chen visited Cheng yesterday morning for a long talk of one hour, and had discussions on the current major plans for peace and war and the reform of politics, economy, and military affairs.</p>
<h3>Fifty Yuan for a Mouthful of Rice</h3>
<p>Liu Jianqun Complains Bitterly</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Guangzhou, 8th] Liu Jianqun, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, complained to reporters today that it was not easy to live in Guangzhou. According to him, after arriving in Guangzhou, he went to the lowest-class restaurant to eat alone, and it cost 50 gold yuan for a mouthful. He ate more than 300 yuan and was still not full. He shook his head and sighed incessantly.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Guangzhou, 8th] About 75 members of the central government and legislators feel that the cost of living in Guangzhou is too high, so a certain female legislator does not advocate that other legislators come to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>The Government's Four Peace Negotiators Still Maintain Close Contact - Zhong Tianxin Will Go to Hong Kong Today and Return to Nanjing Within a Week</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Guangzhou, 8th] A reporter met with Zhong Tianxin, Minister of Water Conservancy and one of the government's peace negotiators, at his private residence on the morning of the 8th. He said that among the five representatives, only Peng Zhaoxian intends not to go, but has not formally resigned. The other four representatives are still maintaining close contact, and all preparations have long been completed. They are looking forward to the results of Yan Huiqing and others' trip. The group will then set off. However, according to reports today, the Communist Party's broadcast stated that they only welcome them to visit Peiping, so whether they can open the door to peace is still a question. He expressed that he was not discouraged about the future of peace, because peace is the demand of the people of the whole country, and the government has long had this determination. In his conversation, he also hinted that at most, the Yangtze River would be used as a boundary in the future to divide the political power. He strongly denied the rumor that Acting President Li and President Sun had different political views, and pointed out that it was an intentional provocation from the outside. In this serious situation, internal division is not allowed. He also said that President Sun and himself would both go to Nanjing within a week, and would frequently travel between Nanjing and Guangzhou in the future. He may go to Hong Kong first on the 9th, but did not say what the mission was.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing - Meets with Financial Circles, Asks for Cooperation to Stabilize Shanghai's Economy - Also Consults with Yan Huiqing and Others - He Yingqin May Return to Nanjing Together Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Acting President Li, accompanied by Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, flew to Shanghai by special plane on the morning of the 8th. Huang Xuecun, Director of the Second Bureau, accompanied him. In addition to meeting with Yan Huiqing and others on this trip, Acting President Li explained the government's sincerity in seeking peace and attended the graduation ceremony of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters People's Self-Defense Force Training Class to give instructions. He was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing on the evening of the 8th, but was unsuccessful due to the adverse weather conditions in the afternoon and will return to Nanjing on the 9th instead.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Acting President Li took the Meiling special plane from Nanjing at 8:30 a.m. yesterday and arrived at around 10 a.m. Shao Lizi, Gan Jihou, Gu Zhutong, Huang Xuecun, and others accompanied him. After disembarking, Mr. Li went to the Shanghai People's Self-Defense Training Class to give instructions, explaining the government's painstaking efforts to sincerely seek peace. At noon, he visited Huang Shaohong to exchange views on the current situation and had lunch together. In the afternoon, he met with Chen Guangfu, Liu Gongyun, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jikui, and other leaders of the city's financial industry separately, and gave very sincere instructions on stabilizing Shanghai's economy, and requested cooperation from all parties. In the evening, he met with Yan Huiqing and other peace representatives to consult on the mission to the north. Acting President Li was originally scheduled to fly back to the capital at 4 p.m. yesterday, but due to the adverse weather conditions in Nanjing, he stayed at Huang Shaohong's residence that night and is scheduled to return to Nanjing by the original plane at 9 a.m. on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 8th] Acting President Li flew to Shanghai on the 8th to continue consultations with the People's Peace Delegation scheduled to go to Peiping to seek ways to start peace talks. Mr. Li knows that the Communist Party has rejected his close advisor Gan Jihou from accompanying the Shanghai delegation to Peiping. It is believed here that the Communist Party's repeated rejection of Mr. Li's efforts to open up peace talks has brought his task of ending the war to the brink of failure. However, Mr. Li's aides firmly insist that he is determined to seek peace and is unwilling to leave Nanjing and go south until he has explored all avenues for peace talks.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is learned that General He Yingqin will go to Nanjing soon and may leave on the 9th. Acting President Li contacted Mr. He after arriving in Shanghai. Representative Will Head To Peiping In Half A Month</p>

<h3>Understanding Reached on Coal-Flour Exchange Between North and South</h3>
<p>Shipping Will Be Initially Restored</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to Mr. Gan Jihou, after contact between the Kailuan Mining Company staff in Shanghai and the Communist Party, an understanding has been reached on the coal-flour exchange.

<h3>Guangzhou Housing Shortage Is Severe - Rent Is Priced in Kind - Director of Land Administration Bureau Explains</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] Since the government moved south to work, the number of residents in Guangzhou has increased sharply, and the housing rental problem is very serious. Li Pusheng, Director of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, told reporters today that since the partial relocation of the government to the south, the number of residents in the city has suddenly increased. In addition to the municipal government assisting various agencies in finding office locations, there are still many family members who have come to the city, resulting in an increasingly serious housing shortage. It is inappropriate for landlords to take this opportunity to demand exorbitant rents, but in recent times, the value of currency has fluctuated sharply. If we adhere to the housing rental regulations, the landlord's losses would be too great, so it is no wonder that landlords are unwilling to accept them. Therefore, in order to maintain the actual value of the landlord at the time of signing the contract and to quell disputes, this is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. Therefore, some advocate using a base number for rent, and some advocate using rice. In fact, rice is the most used now, and it is fairer to pay according to the price of the rice market on that day, because the government has already used rice to rent houses. Using foreign currency, but using official language to handle people's disputes, I feel that my conscience is ridiculous, so the government must formally recognize this fact before it can be easily handled. Otherwise, if the law is too far from the facts, it will not work on its own.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Telegraphed Chongqing - Gave Three Instructions</h3>
<p>Prepare for War, Seek Survival, Respond to War, Seek Peace</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Chongqing, 8th] An important telegram from the highest authorities here stated: (1) In the future, whether there is peace or war, the government can absolutely control the vast areas of the Northwest, Southwest, and Southeast. Historically, "Even with only three households left, Chu could still destroy Qin," and in revolutionary history, "Guangdong alone could send troops north to complete unification." (2) Everything should proceed as usual, in order to prepare for war and seek survival, respond to war and seek peace, not easily believe rumors, and consolidate the revolutionary camp. (3) The significance of the president's retirement should be explained to the officers and soldiers, and unity should be strengthened to eliminate all worries, dangers, doubts, and fears.</p>
<h3>Henan Provincial Government Staff Left in Hankou - Zhang Zhen Orders Immediate Return to Xinyang</h3>

<h3>American President Filmore Sails from New York to Dagu Port</h3>
<p>Hunan Escorting Two Barges to Tanggu</p>
<p>[United Press International, Peiping, 8th] A report received here today stated that the American President Line's "President Filmore" has sailed from New York and will arrive at Dagu Port on the 16th. Stevedoring sources here say that the Communist Party has allowed the American company Taikoo Steamship Company to handle its barging. The Shanghai branch of the President Line has also telegraphed to inquire about the matter, but the Taikoo Company's "Hunan" ship, which recently sailed from Hong Kong to Dagu Port, is still awaiting Communist Party permission and there is no definite news of entry.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 8th] The British Taikoo Steamship Company revealed on the 8th that its "Hunan" ship was the first commercial ship to sail to Tanggu after the Communist army occupied it.

<h3>Communist Army Activities West of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway - Plan to Threaten the Capital's Flank - National Army Seeks to Recover Nantong</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Puzhen, 8th] The Communist Army's activities on the northern bank of the Yangtze River west of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are gradually becoming more active. After the National Army voluntarily evacuated the cities of Quanjiao, Chaoxian, Wuwei, Hanshan, and Hexian, it was recently reported that a large number of Communist troops have entered and stationed in each of these cities. According to a high-ranking military official who told reporters, the Communist Army will change its tactics from facing the National Army head-on, which is concentrated on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway front, and will especially attack from the flanks. It will inevitably use the various sandbars above and below Hexian as a springboard to carry out its landing in places such as Caishezhen on the south bank in an attempt to threaten the capital's flank. However, the National Army is closely monitoring this.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The county towns in the northern part of Jiangsu on the northern bank of the Yangtze River that are still firmly defended by the National Army are Jiangpu and Yiwei.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Shanghai School Tuition Issues</h3>
<p>As winter fades and spring returns, Shanghai's public and private schools at all levels are approaching the start of the school year. Before the term begins, schools face two serious problems: first, the stationing of troops in schools, affecting the start of classes; second, school fees are based on the price of rice, increasing the burden on students' parents. The former pertains to military discipline and social order, essentially unrelated to school education, but it can affect education. The latter pertains to the education system, essentially unrelated to social order, but now it can constitute a social problem. Regarding the withdrawal of troops stationed in schools, various schools have made this request, but it is difficult to say whether the withdrawal can actually occur and whether it will hinder the start of classes. Currently, what weighs heavily on the education sector, especially on the minds of general students' parents, is the issue of school fees, which is attracting considerable attention; and yesterday, a partial solution was reluctantly achieved.</p>
<p>Regarding the tuition fees for schools at all levels this semester, the authorities of universities, middle schools, and elementary schools have made relatively specific decisions, and some city councilors have also participated in the discussion. Regarding the tuition standards for colleges and universities this semester, the principals of private colleges and universities reached a preliminary decision at a meeting on January 10: the tuition and miscellaneous fees for colleges would be calculated based on three and a half piculs of rice, while universities would be calculated based on the price of four and a half piculs of rice, with a principle of collecting the full amount at once. Some university presidents advocated charging fees based on a multiple of the cost of living index. For example, St. John's University and Datong University would divide the semester into three terms, with tuition and fees for each term at St. John's calculated by multiplying a base of 32 yuan by the cost of living index, and at Datong, multiplying a base of 31.33 yuan by the cost of living index. Soochow University would divide the semester into two terms, with a base fee of 48 yuan for each term. Whether based on the cost of living index or calculated with rice, the amount of fees for colleges and universities this semester is alarmingly high. Regarding the tuition standards for public and private primary and secondary schools this semester, since the City Council provided that "the amount of tuition and fees for private schools in the next semester should be converted into the price of commodities, and no additional charges may be levied after full payment" at the end of last year, this provided convenience for primary and secondary schools to use a small amount of rice as the standard for fees, paving the way for this approach. The Municipal Education Bureau did not oppose this idea, but only hoped that the fees would not be too high, increasing the burden on parents of poor students. For a month, the principals of public and private primary and secondary schools held meetings to discuss tuition standards, but they did not reach a unified opinion. Due to the urgency of the start of the school year, a meeting convened by the Municipal Education Bureau on February 5th barely managed to agree on the fees for this semester, using rice as the standard, stipulating that primary schools would charge from 7.5 dou to 1.5 shi, junior high schools from 1.75 shi to 2.5 shi, and senior high schools from 2.25 shi to 3 shi. If this becomes the final decision, the high numbers and the huge differences would not only shock students' parents, but even someone who studies educational theory would feel that this subtle application is not education to cultivate the new generation, but rather to destroy this generation.</p>
<p>Education serves the times, and receiving education is a right. Any violation or deviation from this highest principle is gravely related to the prosperity and decline of society. Undoubtedly, today's education, because of the government's depleted treasury, relies on the assistance of private schools, and the prevailing trend makes receiving education almost like purchasing education; this is entirely the behavior of a commercial society and commercial education. The financial difficulties of public and private schools at all levels in Shanghai are a factual problem, and it is questionable whether the labor income of students' parents can afford these heavy tuition fees, in other words, whether they have this purchasing power. Therefore, in today's extremely difficult situation and such social and economic conditions, it is hoped that there will be a proper relief measure to maintain school funding and take care of parents' burden. The proposed rice-based tuition standards should not be rigidly implemented by the schools.</p>
<p>What kind of measures are in line with the principles of appropriateness and relief, and that are mutually beneficial, truly require educationists and educational administrative authorities to consider the glory of education and the burden on students' parents, face reality, use wisdom, and seek a fair and reasonable level, reducing tuition fees and relaxing the scale of one-time collection. The amount of fees decided by the municipal government yesterday morning in consultation with the principals of private middle schools stipulates: (1) primary school tuition is 6,500 yuan, junior high school is 11,000 yuan, and senior high school is 15,000 yuan. (2) Schools may collect fees in installments, and students may also apply to pay in installments, but not exceeding three installments. (3) For those who pay in installments, primary schools use 40 yuan as the base, junior high schools use 64 yuan as the base, and senior high schools use 90 yuan as the base, dividing by the number of installments and paying according to the cost of living index for that period. Overall, it is considered more reasonable. Because (1) tuition and fees can be paid in installments to facilitate parents of poor children; (2) the price of rice is not used as the standard, so as not to involve other problems; (3) the average base amount set is not too high, according to the principle of two gold yuan equaling one pre-war legal tender yuan. However, here we must add three points. (A) Poor students should be given free or half-price tuition, and the number of scholarship places and the number of free or half-price places for poor students should be increased to the highest proportion as usual. (B) School finances should be made public, and if the finances of each school are indeed difficult, the municipal authorities should provide appropriate relief. (C) For those with truly long histories and outstanding achievements, the municipal authorities may allow an appropriate increase in the percentage of fees, while those with poor reputations should have their fees reduced. (D) Wealthy students' parents should also do their best and donate generously to help schools and teachers overcome the current difficulties.</p>

<h3>Hunan Province's Issuance of Provincial Currency is Shelved; Xiangtan and Other Counties Issue Subsidiary Currency Vouchers, Disrupting the Monetary System; Price Limits in Changsha Reappear Similar to Post-August 19th Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changsha, 8th] The "Silver Dollar Vouchers," which were once widely discussed, have been suddenly shelved due to various practical and technical difficulties in issuance. In order to cope with the current situation, it was decided to issue "Treasury Vouchers" by the Changsha Municipal Bank in another way, still based on silver dollars, with a total amount of 50,000 yuan, adopting a full reserve system. In addition, the Changsha County Government is also planning to issue subsidiary currency vouchers to facilitate grain households in paying grain taxes. As for Xiangtan, Hengshan and other counties, there have long been subsidiary currency vouchers issued by stores circulating automatically, and the chaotic monetary system of twenty years ago has reappeared in Hunan.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changsha, 8th] Changsha City is implementing price limits, and the police department has decided to "borrow heads" from stores that violate the price limits.

<h3>Tang Honglie, Representative of Cheng Qian, Arrives in Guangzhou to Discuss Hunan-Guangdong Economic Cooperation; Liu Jianxu and Liu Fei, on Cheng Qian's Orders, Go to Guangzhou and Hankou Respectively</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] Supervisor Tang Honglie, this time representing Acting Chairman Cheng Qian, arrived in Guangzhou on the 7th to discuss economic cooperation between Hunan and Guangdong provinces with Chairman Xue. That evening, he exchanged preliminary views with Chairman Xue. According to Tang, he told reporters: "The relationship between Hunan and Guangdong provinces has always been close, and economic exchange and cooperation are necessary. When Chairman Wei previously governed Guangdong, the two sides had negotiated a more specific plan as the basis for economic cooperation between the two provinces. Chairman Xue has governed Hunan for many years and has a close relationship with the people of Hunan and has a deep understanding of the situation in Hunan. I am convinced that the economic ties between the two provinces will have further achievements in the future. As for the rumors that Hunan Province has issued silver dollar vouchers, according to what I know in Changsha, Acting Chairman Cheng, based on the need to consolidate the credit and value of the gold yuan vouchers and to facilitate the people who have already widely used silver dollars, has ordered the relevant authorities to release effective measures to issue silver dollar subsidiary currency vouchers, which is one of these measures. As this matter is of great importance, it is still under careful study and deliberation, and whether and when it will be issued has not been decided. Furthermore, the saying that the Hunan Provincial Government withholds national taxes is purely unfounded."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 8th] Liu Jianxu went to Hankou a week ago for official business, returned to Changsha after a brief rest. Liu Jianxu left for Guangzhou on the 7th, and Liu Fei left for Hankou on the 8th. It is reported that both were on Cheng Qian's orders to negotiate with the authorities in Hubei and Guangdong.</p>

<h3>World Disarmament Issue: Security Council Reopens Debate; Expected Soviet Representative to Present New Proposals</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 8th] Soviet Representative Malik is expected to engage in East-West debate on the world disarmament issue at the Security Council meeting on the 8th. Western delegations are eagerly awaiting the Soviet representative's speech, as they believe it may reveal clues about the next move in Stalin's "peace offensive." Malik and his aides have not further confirmed their intention to speak, but United Nations officials point out that the discussions on the disarmament issue have been postponed twice to allow Malik ample preparation time. The United States and Britain have no intention of commenting on this issue unless the Soviet Union puts forward new accusations or new proposals. In view of Stalin's recent proposal for gradual disarmament between the United States and the Soviet Union, some delegations believe that the Soviet Union may propose some new or revised disarmament proposals. At the Paris General Assembly, the Soviet Union's proposal for immediate one-third disarmament by the five major powers and simultaneous abolition and destruction of atomic weapons was rejected by an overwhelming majority. The issue currently pending before the Security Council is the General Assembly resolution passed by the Western countries with a majority vote over Soviet protests. This resolution states that disarmament is impossible under the current poor state of international relations and only stipulates that the United Nations Conventional Armaments Commission should re-discuss theoretical disarmament, pending an improvement in international relations for implementation. Due to the recent peace proposals from the Kremlin, Malik may propose some revisions to the rejected one-third disarmament plan, but the result will still be nothing more than a heated exchange of words. There will be no concrete steps towards reducing armaments, troops, and military spending, as disarmament at present clearly conflicts with Western plans to arm the Western European Union and sign the North Atlantic Treaty to prevent communist aggression.</p>
<h3>United States Continues Aid to European Recovery; Requests Appropriation of $5.58 Billion; Acheson and Hoffman to Testify Before Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 7th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally introduced a bill on the 7th, requesting continued financial assistance for the European Recovery Program for fifteen months, from April of this year to June 1950. During this period, the Economic Cooperation Administration will be allocated $5.58 billion. However, he warned that "Europe must make its own efforts" to make this plan successful. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom also introduced a similar bill in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 8th Broadcast: US Secretary of State Acheson testified before the Foreign Relations Committees of both houses today, stating that one of the achievements of the European Recovery Program is the significant progress in collective security in Europe.</p>
<p>The Brussels Pact is an explicit expression of the signatory countries' determination to maintain their independence and freedom against external aggression, and it has had a major impact on enhancing the sense of security necessary for reconstruction efforts. The United States warmly welcomes this pact and views it as an important contribution to recovery.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 8th] Economic Cooperation Administrator Hoffman told the Foreign Relations Committees of both houses on the 8th, "Although economic aid to China is also one of the responsibilities of the Economic Cooperation Administration, we will not be presenting any recommendations regarding China at this time while listening to the European Recovery Program." Hoffman continued, "In the current rapidly changing situation, economic assistance in unstable regions is continuing on a day-to-day basis. Temporary recommendations and some revisions to the China Aid Act itself will be submitted to Congress for consideration at a later date." He also stated that preliminary plans for aid to Korea would also be submitted before April 1st. Hoffman declared, "Europe has passed the first stage of economic recovery. In the coming months, it must grasp the more difficult issue of making major adjustments to the traditional way of thinking in Europe, which now consumes its own money in the world and is no longer suitable." Hoffman urged Congress to continue implementing European economic recovery, estimating that $5.58 billion would be needed in the next five months.</p>
<p>The Foreign Relations Committees of both houses clearly expressed sympathy, and their approval seems to be a foregone conclusion. Hoffman praised the progress made by recipient countries in the first year of the Economic Cooperation Administration's work on recovery and declared that there was no need to be overly pessimistic about the recent gloomy report from the European Economic Cooperation Office. He stated that the report was not a prediction of future failure but a diagnosis of current weaknesses, so that salvage methods could be found in cooperative readjustments. The report only stated that the current separate recovery programs would not enable Europe to be self-sufficient in four years. In view of this conclusion of the European Economic Cooperation Office, ways to change and integrate the separate national programs can be considered.</p>
<h3>Authorize President Truman to Reorganize Administrative Agencies</h3>
<p>US House Passes Bill to Senate</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 7th] The House of Representatives passed on the evening of the 7th, by a vote of 356 to 9, granting President Truman broad powers to reorganize the executive branch of the government. Republicans attempted to impose some restrictions, but were defeated by the government's strength. This resolution has now been sent to the Senate. The resolution gives the President permanent power to plan changes to administrative agencies. These changes will take effect unless rejected by both houses within sixty days. Prior to the House vote, former President Hoover warned that abolishing some federal agencies due to reorganization could undermine the government's flexible operational plans. He also suggested that Congress thoroughly investigate the propaganda campaign to abolish military engineers. This bill would give the President the power to change, merge, or abolish administrative agencies and transfer their powers to other agencies. This is the first major administrative measure dealt with by the 81st Congress.</p>

<h3>National Peace Promotion Association Postponed to the 12th; Preparatory Committee Decides to Join Forces with Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The preparatory meeting of the National Peace Promotion Association initiated by the Shanghai Municipal Council was held at 3 p.m. yesterday at 295 Tanggu Road to discuss the steps to convene the general assembly. The attendees included Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jigang, Jiangsu Provincial Councilors Huang Sen and Pang Diancai, Henan Provincial Councilors Zhang Honglie, Beiping Municipal Councilor Deng Cuiying, Liaoning Provincial Councilors Zhang Weiguang and Shi Jian, Shenyang Municipal Councilors Wang Shulin and Zhang Shiliang, Shandong Provincial Councilor Pei Mingyu, Anhui Provincial Councilor Xu Wenbin, National Federation of Commerce Wang Xiaolai, Chou Jingwei, and Zhao Dihua, National Automobile Industry Propaganda Jing, China Women's Association Zhuang Jing, Lu Xiaodao, Xiong Shuhang, and Wang Liwen, National Grain Merchants Association Wan Molin, National Association of Western Medicine Physicians Qin Quan, Traditional Chinese Medicine Physicians Association Jin Songpan, China Early Childhood Education Association Luo Chunji, and National Association of Certified Public Accountants Kong Fanxu and He Yuanming, totaling 28 representatives from 18 units. The six representatives who are about to fly to Beiping to negotiate peace with the CCP were invited by Acting President Li yesterday morning to exchange views, which conflicted with the meeting time. None of them attended, except for Ling Xianyang, who arrived at the meeting place, signed in, and left in a hurry.</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting yesterday was presided over by Pan Gongzhan. After the chairman's speech, representatives from various regions spoke one after another, unanimously resolving the following three items: (1) Immediately telegraph the Hankou Seven Provinces and Cities Peace Promotion Association, requesting them to send representatives to Shanghai to present their peace proposals for joint discussion, and immediately contact the Hankou Seven Provinces and Cities Peace Promotion Association by long-distance telephone. (2) The Shanghai Peace Promotion Association decided to postpone the meeting to the 12th of this month. (3) Shanghai Municipal Council Deputy Speaker Xu Jigang was publicly elected as the temporary chairman of the general assembly.</p>
<p>The opinions expressed by Speaker Pan and representatives from various regions at yesterday's preparatory meeting are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Speaker Pan's Opening Remarks: Uphold the People's Stand, Reduce the People's Suffering</h3>
<p>Speaker Pan's opening remarks and report on the political changes between the KMT and the CCP over the past month briefly stated: "On January 8th of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Council issued a telegram promoting peace, which has been enthusiastically responded to by provincial and municipal councils and national professional organizations across the country. This shows the eagerness of the people across the country to seek peace. The Shanghai Municipal Council is willing to take on the responsibility of preparing and convening the Peace Promotion Association. Representatives from various regions have also arrived in Shanghai one after another, and it has been exactly one month since then. During this month, the CCP's broadcasts and the central government's dispatch of peace talk representatives have undergone various changes. However, the Peace Promotion Association will always stand on the people's stand and seek to reduce the suffering of the people from war. The convening of this association is truly related to the future lives and safety of compatriots across the country. All of you have come from afar, and I hope you can express your opinions as much as possible so as to achieve the goal of peace."</p>
<p>Henan</p>
<p>Provincial Councilor Zhang Honglie stated briefly: "Peace is what everyone hopes for. Only with peace can everyone live and work in peace. However, what we need is true peace, which at a minimum must guarantee freedom of body, occupation, and residence."</p>
<p>Beiping</p>
<p>Municipal Council Representative Deng Cuiying stated briefly: "I believe that China has not been able to achieve peace up to now, and the KMT and the CCP must bear responsibility, but the people also have a responsibility. If the people love peace, the KMT and the CCP will definitely not fight. I remember when I was in Beiping, I received a telegram from Shanghai calling for peace and immediately responded enthusiastically. I specifically set up an office in Zhongshan Park to wait for the progress of peace work. Unfortunately, Shanghai has been silent since then. We always feel that Shanghai is close to the government, so it has ignored our longing for peace. If the enlightened people in Shanghai had advocated peace a year and a half ago, the North would not have suffered such a major loss. This is truly a disgrace to the people themselves, but it is not too late to convene the Peace Promotion Association now. I hope that this association will continue its work until the country achieves peace one day."</p>
<p>Shandong</p>
<p>Provincial Council Speaker Pei Mingyu stated briefly: "Since the victory, if both the KMT and the CCP had competed in production and construction, China would have made unimaginable progress by now. Unfortunately, the civil war broke out, causing the people to be exhausted and suffering immensely. Now is the time for the people to awaken. I hope everyone will move forward together on the road to peace, and then China will still have bright and brilliant hope."</p>
<p>Shenyang</p>
<p>Municipal Council Representative stated briefly: "I left Shenyang when Shenyang had not yet fallen. Now I am here to participate in this Peace Promotion Association. I don't know if I am qualified to be a representative. I think the Communist army should first stop military action so that peace talks can succeed."</p>
<p>Jehol</p>
<p>Provincial Council Speaker Wang Zhiyun stated briefly: "There is a national Peace Promotion Association in Shanghai, and there is also a national Peace Promotion Association in Hubei. We received two telegrams at the same time. I don't know which one is better to participate in. I hope the two sides will join forces first and avoid division."</p>
<p>Peace as the Goal, Saving Lives as the Slogan</p>
<p>National Federation of Commerce Wang Xiao stated briefly: "The people need peace, and it has reached the point of crying for help. No matter which is a good government and which is a bad government, the people are unwilling to kill each other. Now we are convening this Peace Promotion Conference. We should take peace as the goal and saving lives as the slogan."</p>
<p>National Association of Western Medicine Physicians Qin Qin stated briefly: "The Kuomintang government of the Three Principles of the People has never achieved the goal of solving the people's livelihood problem since the Northern Expedition. If it maintains the status quo, it is impossible to ask for peace."</p>
<p>China Women's Organization Federation Representative Zhuang Jing stated briefly: "The people love peace, especially women love peace, because women can never break away from the family, and peaceful life is the foundation of a happy family. Since ancient times, women have never launched wars. However, we feel that the peace in Beiping is a disguised surrender, and the CCP's obstruction of Shanghai's representatives is an undemocratic manifestation."</p>
<p>Finally, National Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine Physicians Representative Jin Songpan stated briefly: "There is a Peace Promotion Association in Shanghai, and there is also a Peace Promotion Association in Hubei. This shows that the opinions of the Chinese people are divergent and their spirit cannot be concentrated. We should quickly telegraph the Peace Promotion Association of the seven provinces and cities in Hubei and ask them to come to the meeting, otherwise we will all fly to Hubei to hold the meeting."</p>
<h3>Chongqing Municipal Council: Too Far to Participate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch, Chongqing, 8th] The standing committees of the Chongqing Municipal Council held a joint meeting today and decided not to participate in the Peace Promotion Associations initiated in Shanghai and Hankou, citing the distance as the reason.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch, Lanzhou, 8th] The Provincial Council has dispatched the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to participate in the Shanghai Peace Conference.</p>
<h3>Many Difficulties in Repairing Airports, Difficult to Resume Flights Between Shanghai and Hankou</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hankou flights of China and Central Aviation Companies have been suspended for two months. According to the two companies. It is difficult to expect the flights on this route to resume in the short term. There is no special reason for the suspension of the Shanghai-Hankou route. The Wuchang Airport, which is used for civilian aircraft to take off and land, has been in disrepair for many years, resulting in uneven ground and runways. There are many difficulties for aircraft to take off and land, and it is even more dangerous in rainy weather. The repair costs are huge, and the local government cannot raise funds for repairs. Although there are small-scale repair works, they are of no help. Therefore, it is difficult to resume the Shanghai-Hankou route of civil aviation in the short term.</p>
<h3>Directorate General of Highways Transportation Department Adds Direct Buses Between Shanghai and Wuxi</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of passengers, the Directorate General of Highways has added direct, reserved-seat buses between Shanghai and Wuxi starting today. A bus will depart from both Shanghai and Wuxi at 9 a.m. every day, providing convenience for passengers. The Shanghai ticket offices are located at No. 86 Guangdong Road, First Transportation Department, and No. 865 Qiujiang Road, the Shanghai Station of the Department. It is said that many people have already registered to go.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Route Resumes, Jiangshun Wheel to Sail to Hankou Today</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun Wheel is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 1 p.m. on the 9th for Hankou, stopping at Anqing and Jiujiang along the way. The company's Shanghai-Hankou route has been suspended for two weeks. Therefore, the departure of the Jiangshun Wheel is the first Yangtze River route vessel for the company since the Lunar New Year. Since the National Army withdrew from Jiangbei to Jiangnan, shipping companies regarded the Yangtze River route with fear. If the Jiangshun Wheel runs smoothly, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies can resume shipping on the Yangtze River route.</p>
<h3>Normal Scheduling on South China Routes Expected to Resume After the 20th</h3>
<p>After the suspension of the North China routes, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's express passenger ships Yuanpei, Qiujin, and Xilin, which were all running on the Shanghai-Tianjin route, were changed to South China routes and scheduled to run on the Shanghai-Qingdao, Shanghai-Shantou, and Shanghai-Guangzhou routes. It is now known that the scheduling of express ships on the South China routes is again confused. This is because various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan mostly chartered these three express ships when they moved from Nanjing to Guangzhou. Therefore, normal scheduling on all South China routes cannot be maintained. However, the relocation of the Executive Yuan to Guangzhou is in its final stages, and it is expected that normal scheduling on all South China routes can be resumed after the 20th of this month.</p>

<h3>Municipal Evening Schools to Charge a Uniform 1,400</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Education Bureau convened a meeting of principals of municipal evening schools yesterday morning. The meeting was attended by Bureau Director Li, Section Chief Sun, and more than ten others, including Cao Fengshan, Lu Erqiang, and Zhang Shi. They discussed the tuition standard for the current semester and resolved that both senior and junior high schools would charge a uniform miscellaneous fee of 1,000 yuan and a textbook fee of 400 yuan. Each school is scheduled to begin enrollment on the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>Private School Tuition Standards to be Determined by Index - Elementary School Maximum 6,500 - Junior High Maximum 11,000 - Senior High Maximum 15,000 - Payment in Full Preferred</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The private school tuition issue, which has been a concern for student parents throughout Shanghai, was resolved yesterday. Mayor Wu convened a symposium at 10:00 AM yesterday morning in the Municipal Government conference room. In attendance were Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Education Bureau Director Li, city councilors, and more than ninety school principals. Director Li first reported on the proceedings of the previous meeting, followed by councilors Zhang Zhongyuan, Chen Gongda, Jiang Hao, and others who expressed their opinions. They all argued that tuition should be based on the cost of living index, not converted into rice, as it was unreasonable. Otherwise, workers would also want to calculate wages in rice, which would affect the stability of the entire society. After thorough discussion, it was decided that the tuition fees for private schools this semester would be based on the cost of living index. Based on pre-war tuition standards, private elementary schools charged 20 yuan, junior high schools 32 yuan, and senior high schools 45 yuan, which were converted to a base of 40 yuan for private elementary schools, 64 yuan for junior high schools, and 90 yuan for senior high schools in Gold Yuan Coupons. Since the cost of living index for the upper period of February has not yet been released, and schools are about to open, it was decided to calculate based on the lower period index of January plus 80%. The maximum tuition should not exceed 6,500 yuan for elementary schools, 11,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 15,000 yuan for senior high schools, with payment in full preferred. Children of public educators and students from genuinely impoverished families can apply for installment payments, but only for two or three installments, not exceeding three installments. The amount will be calculated by multiplying the base figure by one-half or one-third of the current cost of living index, according to the installment ratio.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Paint Factory - Boiler Explosion - Kills Engineer - Two Workers Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At around 11:30 AM yesterday, a boiler in the mezzanine of the Guiqiao Paint Factory at 1344 Song Park Road, Zhabei, exploded due to overheating, resulting in three deaths and injuries. The deceased was engineer Liu Gongdu (25 years old, from Suzhou). Upon hearing a sudden loud noise, Liu knew something was wrong and rushed to shut down the motor. However, after the upper-level building shook, the roof collapsed, breaking his left leg and causing severe internal injuries, leading to his death. The injured were worker He Miaozhang (31 years old), who suffered severe burns all over his body, and one factory building collapsed. Upon receiving the report, the Zhabei 123rd Section Fire Brigade dispatched a fire truck to the scene for rescue, sending the deceased and two injured persons to the Fourth Municipal Hospital.

<h3>Railway Workers' Strike - Trains Halted - Workers Demand Better Treatment and Surround the Bureau - Agreement Reached on Three Points That Evening - Passenger and Freight Rates to be Adjusted from the 11th to Cover Salaries</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Workers at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau went on strike suddenly at around 2:00 PM yesterday, demanding better treatment. Trains on both the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines were completely suspended. More than a thousand workers from the Bureau's Engineering Department, Locomotive Department, and the North General Station surrounded the Bureau, creating a tense situation. Chen Fenke, the Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department, was also beaten in the chaos. Later, He Longqing, the Chief of the Investigation Section of the Songhu Garrison Command, arrived with the garrison troops, dispersed the workers, and mediated the situation, which was resolved to some extent by around 8:00 PM. Workers at the locomotive depot expressed their willingness to resume work, but they still need to coordinate with other sections, so the resumption of work was not very smooth. Only the fifth Shanghai-Nanjing train arrived at the station at 8:50 PM, and no other trains entered or left the station until 10:30 PM late at night. If no new obstacles arise today, traffic is expected to return to normal. As for the meager treatment of current employees, Bureau Director Wang Zhaohuai expressed deep sympathy and resolutely decided at yesterday's Bureau meeting to automatically adjust passenger and freight fares on both lines from the 11th of this month (previously, train fare increases had to be approved by the Executive Yuan). The revenue, in addition to coal costs and necessary materials, will be used to cover employee salaries. That is, employee salaries will be automatically adjusted simultaneously with passenger and freight fares from now on.</p>
<p>This railway strike was first initiated by workers at the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory. On the 4th of this month, the Bureau complied with the union's request to advance the rice subsidy for this month, resolving to convert it to 5,390 yuan per stone of Gold Yuan based on the market price of third-grade white japonica rice on that day plus 10%. At that time, the labor side was also satisfied, but the next day, the price of rice soared. The Qishuyan factory workers raised objections the day before yesterday and blocked trains on the tracks, making five demands: (1) Payment of back wages for January. (2) The 5,390 yuan to be treated as an advance, and another stone of rice to be issued. (3) Two stones of rice to be issued as contingency funds. (4) Five stones of rice to be issued as family evacuation funds. (5) Future salaries and subsidies to be calculated in rice. The dispute at the Qishuyan factory was mediated yesterday by Zhou Yan, the commander of the Suzhou Command, with each person temporarily receiving two dou of rice. The rest is to be implemented after the Bureau's unified adjustment measures.</p>
<h3>Police Station Smashed and Detainees Robbed</h3>
<p>At around 2:00 PM yesterday, workers from various units of the Railway Bureau in the city gathered at the Railway Bureau Plaza, claiming to be responding to the petition of the Qishuyan factory workers in Shanghai and shouting for a strike. Traffic on both lines immediately came to a standstill. The number of workers increased rapidly, reaching nearly a thousand or more. However, there were no representatives or demands at the time. Union directors, Bureau Director Wang Zhaohuai, Director Wang Yunxun, and Deputy Director Chen Fenke tried to persuade them without success. At that time, a car from the Ministry of Communications was about to leave, but a blueprint worker from the Engineering Department named Wang Zhongxiang took the lead in blocking the car and deflating the tires. The Railway Bureau Police Department believed that Wang was suspected of disrupting order and arrested him, temporarily detaining him in the direct jurisdiction police station within the Bureau for questioning. After Wang was detained, the crowd rioted, broke into the police station, smashed doors and windows, robbed Wang, and beat Han Kuilin, the Railway Police guarding Wang Zhongqing. After Wang left the police station, he said that he had been electrocuted in the police station and was seriously injured. Upon hearing this, the crowd became agitated, emotions ran high, and they shouted and charged towards the building. The guarding police officers, seeing the tense situation, immediately dispersed, lay on the ground, and held their guns ready to fire.</p>
<h3>Passenger Trains Resume Service at Midnight</h3>
<p>Latest News: The 84th Shanghai-Nanjing train departed at 11:30 PM last night, the first passenger train to resume service after the strike.</p>
<p>(Another Report) Yesterday, military trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line were also affected by the strike and were once suspended. The soldiers were unaware of the reason and mistakenly thought the Bureau was deliberately making things difficult, so incidents of beating stationmasters occurred at Changzhou, Kunshan, and other stations.</p>
<p>The situation when He Longqing, Chief of the Garrison Department, mediated the strike at the two bureaus (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>More Than Ten People Ganged Up to Beat Chen Fenke, Who Was Injured</h3>
<p>At this critical moment, Chen Chen Fenke, injured Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department, rushed down the stairs and stood between the two parties to ease the situation and avoid a tragedy. In the chaos, someone shouted to beat him, and Deputy Director Chen was beaten by a dozen workers, injuring his waist, back, and face. However, the crowd was finally moved by Deputy Director Chen and stopped charging towards the building, but the situation was still tense at this time. The injured Railway Police Officer Han Kuilin was carried to the workers' club for a "public trial." At 5:20 PM, He Longqing, Chief of the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Command, arrived with a large team of armed soldiers, dispersed the workers on the plaza, went to the workers' club to stop the workers' illegal actions, and rescued Han Kuilin. At this time, rumors spread among the crowd that Wang Zhongqing had died at the Sino-American Hospital due to severe injuries from electrocution. The person in charge of the Police Department stated that no electrocution had been used, and the Police Department had no such equipment at all. The blood on Wang's hand was actually caused by him punching the glass window when the workers smashed the police station, and it was absolutely not fatal.</p>
<h3>Treatment Issues - Direct Negotiations</h3>
<p>After Chief He explained the situation, an agreement was reached on three points: (1) Both parties will send representatives to the Sino-American Hospital to examine Wang Zhongqing to determine whether he is dead or has been tortured. (2) Traffic will be restored immediately. (3) Representatives will be sent to negotiate directly with Bureau Director Wang on treatment issues. The workers present at the time agreed with these three points. The workers' representatives immediately set off for the Sino-American Hospital. After investigation, it was found that Wang had voluntarily gone to the hospital for examination at around Xishi, where it was found that his left wrist and other parts had been cut, the epidermis was broken, and the injury was minor. He was discharged after being bandaged, and a certificate of injury was issued by the Sino-American Hospital. Meanwhile, the union directors met with Bureau Director Wang. Bureau Director Wang told them with a very sincere attitude about the decision made at the Bureau meeting to automatically adjust freight rates and adjust treatment at the same time. However, there are many employees and complex organizations in the two bureaus, and it will take about a week to calculate the extent of the treatment adjustment. He also agreed to work with accounting and auditing departments today to check the cash on hand and issue some money in advance. He asked the union directors to convey this to the workers in various departments and urged them to take into account the country and the people and resume work as soon as possible. The union directors left at 8:40 PM, and the storm subsided to this point.</p>

<h3>Basketball League Game Last Night - Renyu Defeats Huili</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In a Group A game in the basketball league yesterday afternoon at 5:30, Huili suffered another defeat. Renyu played extremely well, defeating Huili 63-35. The score was 34-15 in the first half. Huili was out of sync throughout and unable to develop. Wang Cunzhong, Chen Zhengmiao, and Ye Yunshan were unable to play last night, which had an impact. After the game began, Shen Pengju made a layup, opening the scoring. Xu Zhongyi and Wang Huaiting both scored, and Renyu's momentum was strong, leading 6-0. Huili replaced Wei Shu with Xu Shuyuan, but still couldn't find a way to get going. Renyu was able to do whatever it wanted. The first half ended with Renyu leading 34-15. After the break, Huili's situation did not improve. Renyu's forwards were very active. Huili only relied on Cao Zhiji and Zhang Pu to support the situation. When the score was 53-27, Wang Yongfang and Cao Zhiji scored three points in a row, but at 53-33, the score was still a huge difference of 20 points. Huili was finished, and their luck was bad, with many shots missing. The final score was 63-35, and Huili was miserably defeated by Renyu.</p>
<h3>Families of Jiangya Victims - Group Petition at China Merchants Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the Jiangya ferry disaster, the families of the victims organized a committee and repeatedly requested compensation from the China Merchants Bureau. At the end of last year, the Bureau allocated 5,000 yuan in relief funds to each family. The day before yesterday, the committee sent representatives to the China Merchants Bureau to make three demands: (1) The Bureau should pay each deceased passenger compensation equal to 100 stones of rice. (2) Funeral expenses of 25 stones of white rice. (3) For families whose bodies have not been recovered, coffin and burial expenses should still be calculated and allocated. The Bureau promised to respond at 4:00 PM yesterday. The families first gathered at the Limin East Road Siming Cemetery at 8:00 AM and arrived at the second floor of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association at around 9:00 AM to wait. Until 4:00 PM, a representative from the Bureau replied, only agreeing to pay another 5,000 yuan in relief funds per person. The compensation issue will not be considered for the time being and will be discussed after the responsibility is determined. After the representatives reported to the families, they felt that the number was too small and expressed their dissatisfaction. They unanimously decided to go to the China Merchants Bureau to petition. They departed in batches from the Hanbo Fellow Villagers Association. After receiving the report, the police authorities, in addition to dispatching a large number of police officers from the Laoza Gate Police Sub-bureau, also dispatched a flying fortress from the General Bureau to provide protection.</p>
<h3>Thieves and Other Criminals Evacuated from Prison - Police Bureau Requested Delayed Release - To Avoid Endangering Social Security</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Shanghai Prison continued to evacuate a total of 132 prisoners yesterday, mostly bandits, about 60 or more, and the rest were drug addicts, traitors, thieves, and murderers, but none were well-known figures. The Police Bureau sent a letter to Shanghai Prison requesting that the release of bandits and thieves be delayed to avoid endangering social security. If there is a shortage of prison rations, the Police Bureau is willing to subsidize them. The prison authorities believed that the evacuation of prisoners was an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Police Bureau's subsidy of prison rations was also not an appropriate measure, so they decided to continue the evacuation. However, before the release of the bailed bandits and thieves, the prison authorities gave them a lecture, encouraging them to reform and become new citizens.</p>
<h3>Legislator Drug Trafficking Case Announced - Wang Zhibin Sentenced to Seven Years - Defendant Expresses Dissatisfaction</h3>

<h3>Yoshii and Others Suspected of Treason - Transferred to the High Procuratorate for Review - Portion of Bribery Charges Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Luo Jianbai, former director of the Shanghai Branch of the Japanese Culture Committee of the Central Propaganda Department, and his secretary Luo Kedian, were sued for colluding with Japanese Yoshii Mutsumi to evade customs duties, embezzlement, and three major charges of treason. After the District Procuratorate separately investigated and filed a public prosecution, Judge Wang Jiaxuan of the District Court had previously declared all defendants not guilty of smuggling and tax evasion, and Yoshii and others were released on bail. Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court concluded the trial for the bribery charges yesterday morning and also declared them not guilty. The third charge of treason was transferred to the High Procuratorate for review.

He speaks fluent Shanghainese and is a well-known "China expert."</p>
<h3>Commodity Tax Bureau Employees - Demand Relief Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The salaries of general employees in various units of the Municipal Commodity Tax Bureau have been only a few hundred to over a thousand yuan per month since October. Since the Lunar New Year, prices have soared, and the small amount is barely enough to survive. Recently, the employees jointly requested the Bureau to issue a one-time relief fund of 50,000 yuan per person and prepared to implement "inability to work" to achieve their goal. Yesterday, after the Bureau Director convened representatives to discuss the matter, he agreed to issue 15,000 yuan per person, but the employees rejected it because it was far from their request and are still in a stalemate.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Calls on Trade Associations to Discuss - Handling of Special Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit - Resolves to Deny 7.9 Jiao Gold Yuan per US Dollar</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in response to the Ministry of Finance's reply on the supplementary measures for handling special foreign currency certificates of deposit, convened a discussion with 16 relevant trade associations yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, including import-export, copper, tin, new drugs, iron, steel bars, electrical appliances, wool textiles, and enamel. More than 20 people attended, including Chen Guisheng, Chen Maoxun, Hua Hongtao, Ye Xuxin, Ding Huikang, Chuan Shaocai, and Xiao Erjun. Yan E'sheng chaired the meeting. The chairman first reported that after the Import-Export Management Committee announced the differentiated treatment measures for special foreign currency certificates of deposit, the Chamber had convened various industries to discuss them in detail. As a result, it was believed that the treatment measures were quite different from the original measures. However, in consideration of the country's financial difficulties, they were reluctantly accepted, but four requests were made regarding the offset of technology:</p>
<p>(1) Please issue special foreign currency certificates of deposit quickly. (2) The offset should start from the current quarter, not rigidly stipulated as the eighth quarter. (3) Special foreign currency certificates of deposit should be issued Gold Yuan public bonds at the current exchange rate, which should be converted at the current exchange rate at the time of issuance, not rigidly stipulated as 20 Gold Yuan per US dollar. (4) Gold Yuan public bonds take time to print. Please follow the US dollar short-term treasury bill method and exchange the certificate of deposit for a public bond receipt first. The above four points were telegraphed to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance by the Chamber on December 20 last year, requesting adoption. On February 3, a telegram was received from the Ministry of Finance: (1) The Central Bank is rushing to issue special foreign currency certificates of deposit. (2) The offset is still in accordance with the Yuan's order, starting from the eighth quarter. However, the industrial import review procedures can be expedited by the Import-Export Management Committee. (3) In section B of Article 3 of the treatment measures, for the issuance of public bonds in exchange for certificates of deposit, if the current exchange rate changes in the future, it can be calculated according to the "legal exchange rate" on the date of issuance of the bond. (4) The Central Bank's first issuance of public bond receipts can be handled in principle. However, the issuance of public bonds takes time, and the filling and issuance of receipts requires considerable technical consideration. If the original importers and exporters are willing to exchange for cash, the Ministry can submit a request to the Yuan to amend the regulations and change them to a one-time issuance of cash calculated at a rate of 474,000 yuan per US dollar, which is increased fivefold. The Ministry ordered that this point be answered quickly, so relevant industries were convened to discuss how to respond, etc. After careful study by the attendees, it was decided: (1) Section B of Article 3 of the differentiated treatment measures stipulates that public bonds should be issued in exchange for certificates of deposit according to the "current exchange rate," not the "legal exchange rate." The current exchange rate at that time was noted as 20 Gold Yuan per US dollar. This exchange rate is no longer in effect. Even the government's settlement of foreign exchange for imported or exported goods is calculated according to the settlement transfer certificate, with each US dollar equal to more than 800 Gold Yuan. This is the current "current exchange rate." Since the government's foreign exchange income is calculated based on this, how can it still be converted at 20 yuan per US dollar for debt repayment? The Ministry of Finance should be asked to correct the words "legal exchange rate." In the future, the exchange of certificates of deposit for public bonds should be converted according to the price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate at the time of issuance. (2) If the certificates of deposit are exchanged for cash at a rate of 474,000 yuan per US dollar and then multiplied by five, each US dollar would only be equivalent to 7.9 jiao of Gold Yuan Coupons, which is less than one-fourteenth of the current market price and less than one-thousandth of the current foreign exchange transfer certificate. Moreover, the Ministry must submit a request to the Yuan to amend the treatment measures, and official documents must be processed and passed at meetings, which will take time. At least three months will be required for issuance. In today's malignant inflation, it is even harder to imagine what the value of 7.9 jiao will be after three months. Therefore, all industries find it difficult to accept the Ministry of Finance's cash exchange method and request that the government still exchange the special foreign currency certificates of deposit back at the market price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate at the time of issuance. (3) According to the implementing regulations, special foreign currency certificates of deposit should be offset in six quarters, each quarter lasting three months, for a total of 18 months, starting in November of the 36th year. It has now been 16 months since November of the 36th year, and it is about to be offset. Even if the national currency is exchanged at the market price exchange rate, half of it should be exchanged, but after a delay of one and a half years, no repayment has been made. Government credit has been completely lost, which is heartbreaking. Today, it is really unreasonable to give cash at 7.9 jiao of Gold Yuan Coupons per US dollar. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce must make a sincere statement to the Ministry of Finance, asking Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance to fulfill his promise to maintain price confidence when he took office, and quickly issue foreign currency certificates of deposit, and issue public bonds at the market price exchange rate at the time of issuance, fulfilling the government's obligations under the contract.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Stock Exchange Brokers to Discuss Resumption Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Stock Exchange has already sent a letter to the Brokers' Association, notifying them of permission to resume business on the 21st and instructing each broker to pay their margin as scheduled. The Brokers' Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon starting at 4:00 PM, chaired by Wang Naixu, Chairman of the Association. After reporting the Stock Exchange's notice of resumption, discussions began. Two important resolutions were made: (1) The brokers' margin is currently stipulated to be 300,000 Gold Yuan for each of the two categories of price-adjusted bonds and stocks, with 40% in cash and the remaining 60% in listed government bonds or state-owned enterprise stocks. All must be paid in full by the 16th of this month. The Association proposed extending the deadline for paying the 60% in substitutes to the end of this month, as the listing date of gold bonds is not yet certain. In addition to state-owned enterprise stocks, it is hoped that private enterprise stocks will also be allowed. Regarding the 40% cash requirement, it is hoped that bank guarantees can be used as a substitute. Regarding these points, it is planned to prepare an official letter and ask Chairman Wang Naixu to contact the Stock Exchange authorities and forward it to the competent authorities for flexible handling. (2) The Brokers' Association urgently hopes that the Stock Exchange will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministries of Finance and Industry in the future, to fully protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Stock Exchange and brokers, and that local institutions will not interfere arbitrarily.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Slightly Outside the Market</h3>
<p>Rice: The limited price within the market remains without transactions. The government continues to release 5,000 dan (石), priced at 4,500 yuan. Prices outside the market have seen a slight increase, and transactions are also brisk, especially in early trading. White粳 (Japonica rice) was at 7,300 yuan, later slightly retreating to 7,000 yuan due to poor digestion. Thin稻 (thin-husked rice) also closed at 7,000 yuan, each up 300 yuan. Early稻 (early rice) started at 7,000 yuan, closing at 6,600 yuan. 秈米 (Indica rice) trading was light. 糙粳 (unpolished Japonica rice) was at 5,950 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains: The market remains firm. Soybean prices fluctuated. Oil factories purchased 车豆 (car soybeans), slightly increasing by 300 yuan. 乍豆 (sudden soybeans) were stable. 桑園黃豆 (Sangyuan yellow soybeans) decreased by 10%. 生仁 (raw peanuts) were slightly up 500 yuan, influenced by the rising rice prices. Nanjing and Linhuai Pass were both traded at 12,500 yuan. Sesame supply exceeded demand, and 黄蔴 (yellow sesame) quickly retreated by 1,000 yuan. 苟米 (Gou rice) was inquired about by the Qing Gang (gangster organization), and the market initially fell and then rebounded. Red sorghum sales were sluggish, falling nearly 10%.</p>
<p>Flour: Slightly increased. At the beginning of the market, prices were firm and rising due to relaxed monetary policy and rising rice prices. 老车 (Old Vehicle) and 兵船 (Warship) broke the 3,000 yuan mark. In the middle of the market, due to tighter monetary policy, sellers unloaded goods, and the market became unsustainable. Warship once retreated to defend the 3,000 yuan mark. Afterwards, there were not many fluctuations, and the market hovered. Old Vehicle closed at 3,180 yuan, with a high of 3,200 yuan. Warship opened at 3,050 yuan in the afternoon and closed at 3,040 yuan, with transactions occurring. Bran surged sharply, because the previous day's decline was quite large, and buyers took advantage of the low prices.</p>
<p>Edible Oil: Turned upward, because the previous day's decline was too large. Yesterday, rice prices and off-market prices rose, and market sentiment was slightly firmer. Sellers raised prices. Soybean oil initially started at 35,500 yuan, closing slightly lower at 33,500 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil closed at 27,000 yuan, each up 200 yuan. 吉桶 (Lucky Barrel) raw oil closed at 37,000 yuan, with few offers, up 1,500 yuan. Small cart sesame oil had some sporadic transactions, priced at 38,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake also increased by 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Rebounds Firmly</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell but ended firm. Transactions from local customers remained thin, with only retail investors slightly chasing. As a result, except for 42-count slightly weakening, the rest all flourished. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 370,000 yuan to close at 390,000 yuan, down 10,000 yuan from before. 40-count Jincheng rose by 15,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 290,000 yuan and closed at 320,000 yuan, ultimately rising by 25,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at 220,000 yuan, and under the pull of the table, once rose to 255,000 yuan, closing at 245,000 yuan, a gain of 3,000 yuan. Factory orders appeared at 230,000 yuan for immediate delivery and 240,000 yuan for next-day delivery.</p>
<p>20-count Double Horse steadily rose from 200,000 yuan to close at 220,000 yuan. Jincheng slightly rose by 5,000 yuan to close at 225,000 yuan. 16-count Guangming initially traded at 190,000 yuan and closed above the 200,000 yuan mark, up 5,000 yuan from before. 10-count Boy Scouts initially opened at the original price of 170,000 yuan and finally rose to 180,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. The fluctuations in other yarns were very small, making it difficult to be optimistic in the short term.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Hovered and rose slightly. Monetary policy was not too tight. Various cloths initially made progress, but then sensitive parties sold off continuously, and the trend fell again, with a soft state again near closing. Leading fine cloth opened outside the market at 9,500 yuan, fell to 8,900 yuan near noon, and heard that 9,200 yuan had some transactions at noon. Trumpet Boy fine cloth fell all the way from 8,500 yuan to close at 7,550 yuan, a slight increase of 50 yuan from before. B Leading fine cloth still stood at the original level of 7,000 yuan the day before, without moving.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge initially opened at 9,000 yuan, once called for a price of 9,200 yuan, closed loosely at 8,100 yuan, and then rebounded to 8,500 yuan, a gain of 550 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong rose by 200 yuan to close at 7,900 yuan. Dyeing and weaving factories continued to open at the same prices as the previous day, but transactions were not smooth, and the ground situation for various cloths was flat.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Turns Firm and Excellent Again</h3>
<p>Since the trend of tung oil leaned towards the downstream the day before, it opened yesterday with continuous activity. In addition, many off-market materials rebounded, so the mentality of holders also turned firm and excellent, and the process suddenly and rapidly recovered. As a result of the close, there was a consistent gain of more than 1,000 yuan. However, 青油 (green oil) remained in a stalemate, with supply and demand being relatively equal.</p>
<h3>Gold Bonds to Be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] It is reported that gold bonds will be issued by the Central Bank starting from the 11th. When listed on the Stock Exchange, there will be two types: spot and one-day futures.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Ministry of Finance, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and consulted with Liu Gongyun, President of the National Bank, several times. As a result, it was decided that gold bonds will be sold in Shanghai first within a few days. The first phase of the national issuance amount is tentatively set at 100,000 taels, with Shanghai accounting for half. The daily market price will be posted by the National Bank and entrusted to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and China Trust Bureau for sales.</p>
