<h3>分乘百餘船隻企圖登陸　瀏河口共軍被擊退　浙贛路橫峯弋陽鷹潭一帶聯絡中斷　嘉興北王江涇共軍回竄</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕據軍方五日晚九時發佈戰訊：</p>
<p>（一）蕭山附近今晨發現少數士共活動，我守軍正嚴密搜勦中。</p>

<p>（四）嘉興北王江涇竄到匪廿三軍一部千餘人，經國軍阻擊後回竄。</p>
<p>（五）皖南各縣自被匪侵入後，即大肄搜刮，民間糧食即僅存斗米，亦須征繳半數，並强迫青年壯丁參軍，老年男子亦被征集組織担架隊，或輸送隊，迫令分赴前綫，當地士共更變本加厲，實行清算鬥爭，或稍具智識，薄有田產，即被指為頑固份子，或資產階級，皆為清算鬥爭之對象，無一倖免，善良民眾，因不堪匪之殘暴壓迫，甘受流浪之痛苦，紛紛逃亡者不計其數。</p>

<p>（一）四日下午六時，匪千餘，分兩股向太倉以北之直塘及周墅竄擾，我守軍某部即派强力部隊阻擊，發生激戰，當斃傷匪百餘，俘十二名，餘匪不支，向西北潰竄。</p>

<h3>下院展開辯論　英對中國局勢採不干涉政策　保守黨建議簽訂太平洋公約</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播：英下院對中國局勢之辯論，由國防部長亞歷山大揭開，渠謂英政府對華採不干涉政策，不欲被牽入中國內戰漩渦。但保守黨議員要求政府採取若干措置，以遏阻共產主義在遠東擴張勢力。保守黨議員麥美倫建議簽訂太平洋公約，以遏阻共產主義。渠要求政府明白表示：香港所遭遇之任何攻擊，將被視為侵略行為。麥氏提出警告稱：克林姆宮共產黨最高當局可能暫時中止其在西方之擴張勢力，以便在東方覓致更有利之成就。</p>
<p>據亞歷山大謂：英國將派遣陸海空軍增援香港，以防禦共產黨可能的攻擊。此項增援軍隊包括步兵，坦克車，野戰砲，高射砲，戰鬥機，巡洋艦，航空母艦等。亞氏並透露英國已在遠東建立新的防綫。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕下議院五日辯論中國問題時，艾德禮首相預料將向中共提出警告，聲明香港是英國的，英國將不惜代價使其繼續屬於英國，艾德禮並將從紫水晶號事件，談到英國在華的政策，甚至更可能述及英政府與中共所將樹立的關係將為何種性質。倫敦及華盛頓外交方面對放英首相之此一聲明，均以最大興趣在期待中。一般預料艾氏不致有急進性質的意見發表，不過英政府人士未作關於在華政策的聲明，而由於近來遠東局勢的急遽變化，國內外人士紛紛要求英政府速作明確的表示，美國對華新政策亦尚待决定中，故對艾德禮此一聲明，自應予以最密切的注意，關係方面透露，自長江中英艦被砲擊之事件發生後，英美政府間就中國局勢，已有較前更密切的接觸。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕國防大臣亞歷山大宣布，下議院於五日辯論中國局勢及中共砲擊長江英艦之事件時，政府將順便發表關於香港防務的聲明。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫教四日電〕保守黨領袖等在準備本月五日中國問題之辯論，主張與在遠東有權益而受共黨威脅之國家採取一致行動。保守黨人士稱：「國際共黨已在中國贏得顯著勝利，英國政府未完全體會此項勝利之範園」o在五日之辯論中，保守黨將主張「整個遠東如不欲被陷，則應採取積極之政策及一致之行動」。根據保守黨之觀點，安全似將端賴於區域性防禦措置之發展。在危險地帶邊緣之各國均或將加入此項措置，計有澳洲·紐西蘭·馬來亞·香港·菲烈濱·暹羅·印尼·越南·印度及巴基斯坦等。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦四日電〕邱吉爾及保守黨四日準備在下院五日辯論中國局勢時，向工黨政府之遠東政策作猛烈之攻擊，艾德禮首相將主持此次全面辯論，并將為政府發表聲明，邱氏將答覆之。</p>
<p>議員向政府提出各項問題之名單中，最主要者為在共軍席捲中國下香港是否能予防衛。政府拒絕透露英國遠東艦隊之實力，但允許於五日答覆關於香港問題。</p>
<p>當長江衝突事件英海軍死四十二人之後，羣情憤怒要求立即檢討政府之遠東政策，并决定辯論日期，當時政府要求辯論展期至五日。</p>
<p>海軍部駐議會代表德哥德爾已率直拒絕保守黨要求列舉於共軍攻擊紫水晶號時，英國在太平洋中之軍艦。渠并反對政府透露「防衛情報」之政策。在再度要求下，德氏承認自一九四七年十月之後太平詳中無英國航空母艦，邱吉爾及其保守黨下屬將攻擊政府在紫水晶號遭轟擊時未有航空母艦在該地區。</p>

<p>〔巴黎廿七日訊〕在巴黎，一個受薪階級每月不過交一塊錢租金，够六口之家居住房子，每月不過交二塊錢（等於最賤的香烟十包）中等公寓有三個或四個房間的，通常的租錢每月由一元五角至二元五角。高級官員或大人物每月也不過要交三元半至八元或十元房租。</p>
<p>這一種現狀似乎是極好的，可是那又有很壞的地方，因為屋子總是沒有空，沒有人搬出，而業主不能趕走住客，新婚的夫婦因為找不到房子住，所以必定要同父母或太太的外家同住，在巴黎，實際上十二年來都沒有建過新屋了。</p>
<p>唯一得到房子住的機會，就是人們死亡。</p>
<p>有人死，你就可以設法去租那死人的房間。所以，在公園裏晒太陽的龍鐘潦倒的老人，他後面就有青年的太太同他的房東商量準備頂手他的房間。別的則和殯儀館打交道聯絡聯絡。</p>
<p>想租到人死後的寓所的，有兩個法子講法律的一個是：假如你能够履行若干可獲優先的條件，你就可以取到一個徵用機會，但常常有幾個人都能够取得這個徵用機會的，所以此路常常走不通。別一個法子是不講法律的，而且倒是一個最可靠的辦法，那就是叫你和那個死者的承繼人商量商量，當那人死了後你馬上搬幾件傢私進去。你一經踏入那房子，你便是神仙</p>
<p>要找一個公寓房子，大約要你五百元至一千五百元一月。所以受薪階級的人，休作住大屋之想，他們祗能够同家人住在破爛的旅店裏。</p>
<p>巴黎大約有八萬四千間住屋，幾乎百份之九十是第一次世界大戰前建築的，甚至官方也估計有一萬六千間是失修而要拆除的，其餘的也不見得堪稱滿意，巴黎房子有百份之八十二沒有浴室，有半數以上的人要到外間去如厠，有五份一甚至有水喉，六間屋中祇有一間多些是為政府稽查員認為完整的。</p>
<p>業主大都沒有錢去維持他們的生產，改進更談不到，舉一個例來說明一般的情形吧，有一個女人擁有三間屋的，共計有三十四個房間，通通是租給中等家庭住居，除納稅和修葺費，她的租項收入非但無所盈餘，而且一年裏要蝕八十元，他的兒子要負擔養她，要拿出八十元來，替她交稅，但她不能將房屋賣掉，因為根本沒有人願賣屋的。</p>
<p>你想停止修葺而歛回一點錢吧，那又勢不可能，試過有一個業主未如期修葺他的物業，以致漏雨損壞了房客的幾張靠手椅，他被控告了，結果要賠償損失，而且要罰錢，巴黎的屋租，從一九一四年已經加起了六倍，但稅起了十三倍二，而修葺費由一九一四年的價值起了一百二十至一百五十倍。</p>
<p>法國國會，已費了許多時間想法子來解决這個複雜的問題，事實上，法國自從光復後，法律上規定准許業主加租，但零售價起高很多很多，簡單點說，新屋宇（由一九一四年以後建的）准照第二次世界大戰前加租不過十倍，舊房屋（十屋其九是舊屋）則准照一九三九年增租百之十二，或即等於一九一四年的百份之七。</p>
<p>如果今日建築一座新樓的話，業主大概會照現時租值增收十至十三倍，然後能够敷衍。那麽，根據法國經濟局的報告書所載的屋租情形，則一個受薪階級住的房屋有三房一廚房的，現時租值為一年十三元至十六元，將來收一年一百六十六元至二百元，一位法國觀察家說：縱然是如此，也是沒有人願意去建新屋的。</p>
<h3>陳納德在美報業俱樂部演講　美國對華僅有三途可循　淡然處之·對共綏靖·立即援助</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓四日電〕陳納德將軍四日告新聞記者及政府官員稱，美國對中國作一决定之時間，厥為目前，否則將失諸太晚。</p>
<p>今日擁擠在全國報業俱樂部寬敞房間中聆取陳納德發言者，達七百五十人，幾乎打破紀錄，陳氏謂美國對華僅有三途可循，即（一）淡然處之，（二）對共綏靖，（三）立刻援助。</p>
<p>陳氏復重申其昨向參院軍事委負會發表之言，叙述中國西南兩部之廣大，謂如果予以援助，中國必可扼守西南兩部以抗中共。惟陳氏在發表預先擬就之意見後，答覆問話，復建議：（一）予國民政府以直接軍事經濟援助，但由美方在中國政府之上層直接監察此等援助之運用。去年關於一億二千五百萬元軍事援助程序，渠曾作類似之建議，惟當時曾忽略監察一節。（二）美國向國足政府保證予以道義上之援助，俾彼等能「在一個旗幟下組織與作戰。」（三）美國若淡然處之或從事綏靖，僅能產生共產黨征服全中國，最後征服全亞洲之結果。</p>
<p>以往的軍事援助並未能及時運達　陳氏率直否認中國曾在可以利用之美國援助中獲得二十億元，並稱一億二千五百舊元程序下之軍事援助，並無任何部份落入共黨之手。其原因之一厥為軍事援助並未及時到達中國。如果共黨奪獲任何軍事援助，則必係「在太平洋中或舊金山奪獲者，因在徐州陷落前，軍事援助從未到達上海。」（按前傳美國運華軍器，改運台灣。）</p>
<p>或問渠是否得知魏德邁長篇秘密報告之內容，陳氏答渠不知，惟暗中懷疑該報告係建議援助中國。</p>
<p>陳氏竭力頌揚魏德邁，稱魏氏指揮美軍中國戰區時，指揮之行動，極合需要。陳氏曾兩度引起哄堂大笑。渠云：渠「必須商諸律師」，然後答覆渠在刋行其近著「戰士之路」一書以前，曾否得陸軍部審核許可，眾大笑。對於渠今日之言在發表前曾否得國防部長審核許可一節，陳氏作同樣之答覆，眾又大笑。（按國防部長約翰森近暫命令退伍軍官之演說或文字，發表以前須交陸軍部審核。）</p>
<p>太平洋剩餘物資可用者為數頗微</p>
<p>或問自日本投降以來，中國曾否獲得二十億元之援助如國務院報告中所云者，陳氏答曰，中國從未獲得彼等可加運用之任何援助。」美國方面估計價值八億六千萬元，而中國方面試從太平洋各島獲取之剩餘財產，大半不能使用，頗多作為廢鐵重新售予美國。美國給予中國之軍事配備，中國可予使用者，為數頗微，中國不得不向加拿大購買蚊式轟炸機，因彼等不克從美國獲得必要之飛機。再者，中國不能獲得其已有飛機之零件或五〇口徑機關檐彈。珍珠港事變以前，美國一面以廢鐵與油售予日本，一面予中國以道義援助，尚能帮助中國作戰。目今此種道義支持最為有效。</p>
<p>或問如果蔣總裁及國民黨份子工作無效，為何不試用新的領導人物，陳氏答：「如能發現新的領導人物，此或許為良好意見。惟中國曾試圖發現一新的領導人物而未果。就渠所知，美國並無保證協助中共之秘密協定。</p>
<p>政府區數億人民均願對共黨作戰</p>
<p>陳氏一再力言，現有數億人民在非共黨控制之中國，均準備能够且願意對共黨作戰，西北部之回教徒立誓至死與共黨作戰，且已屢次擊敗共軍。中國之「畢茨堡」—太原之守軍，已表現出中國人民戰鬥意志之良好榜樣，太原被圍數月，遭熾烈轟繫凡十日，工事盡毀，守軍全滅，然後陷落。彼等作戰英勇已極，因彼等多年來已成該省府企業之股東。</p>
<p>或請估計中國人作戰之需要如何，陳氏答稱：故史蒂威將軍曾估計二千噸小武器之藥彈，可配備中國軍隊一師作戰六個月。</p>
<p>陳氏認為美國有與中共作事商業之可能性極小，稱：共黨將准許美國出售某數種需要極迫切之貨物，但須受嚴格管制下，直至共黨能在其他地方獲得此等貨物時，將不再准許美國出售。</p>
<p>艾契遜告記者稱國務院態度不變</p>
<p>同時，國務卿艾契遜告新聞記者稱：該院之熊度未變—即繼續援助將為浪費。</p>
<p>又參議員孟德及諾蘭稱：渠等已在準備修正案，以期修正軍火法案，而使中國得到援助。</p>
<p>艾契遜對於陳納德昨日之言論，拒不置評。</p>
<p>諾蘭近曾要求參院外交委員會調查美政府「緩滯」之對華政策，惟該委員會主席康納利稱，歐洲問題居先，「此外，我人對於中國，所聞巳多。」諾蘭稱：委員會對渠之要求未有行動，渠祇得設法將中國包含入軍火法案中，為圖獲得一切有關中國之情勢起見，渠已要求參院軍事委員會邀請魏德邁將軍繼陳納德之後，向軍事委員會發表證言。</p>

<h3>社論　重視生產事業！</h3>
<p>大局動亂，生產事業首受打擊，最為慘重；這種情形，在本市所感受的，更為深切，更為嚴重！因為本市的生產事業，本質上是依賴性的，原物料及燃料，必須仰給於其他生產地帶，而產品的銷路，也必須借重於其他的市場，在交通不便的時候，影響甚大。最近自共軍南波後，本市對外交通，幾陷於完全斷絕的地步，以致物資斷流，產品滯銷，整個生產事業，陷於癱瘓的狀態。</p>
<p>這幾年來，各地遭受戰事的破壞，人民購買力都已低弱到極點，對於工業品的出路，不啻是意外的打擊。現在戰火直接戚脅到上海，果真一旦上海成為戰場，則不但無法從事再生產，即這僅存的一點工業設備，恐怕也不免於無情的破壞。前幾天，中國工程師學會為此特發出緊急　呼籲，請當局愛護生產設備，莫使倖存的生產設備，再被軍事吞沒，替國家民族留　滴元氣，替民生所依的生產事業，留一綫生機；這話充滿了血和淚，是何等的哀怨！又是何等懇切！我們為了千秋萬世的子孫們着想，也要珍視和愛護這全國唯一的生產事業。</p>
<p>我們的主要生產事業，過去大都是操在資力雄厚的外商之手，本國產業界根本無法與之競爭，以致形成殖民地的經濟狀態。抗戰勝利，外人在華特權取消後，遠見熱心的民族工業家們，這才致力於生產事業的建設；殊不料內戰繼起，使生產事業無法抬頭，尤其捐稅的繁重，實使產業界不堪負担。「虛盈實稅」一句話，已寫盡「生產事業在付稅上所受的痛苦。但當時環境雖然相當的惡劣，而產業界仍可作堅苦的奮鬥，如發展南洋貿易，實行南北物資交換等辦法，使生產事業能够苟延殘喘到今天，可是現在連這些小路都被摭斷了，生產事業的前途，縱令不被砲火所毀滅，恐怕也要被窒息而死了。</p>
<p>生產事業另一重的困難，即是資金的籌措問題，如所週知，產業資金所需的是長期資金，可是在當前的情勢下，幣值日夕數變，游資多假手於地下錢莊，成為買空賣空的投機家們的資本，誰肯作為長期的拆放？而且工廠即使能勉强借得到手，則利息的重負，也非從事生產的工廠們所能吃得消的；縱或有之，那都是產業界在週轉不靈時忍痛的飲酖止渴的一種行為而已。過去產業界還仰賴國家銀行的低利貸款，以求維持，但自時局緊張後，這種貸款，便已銷聲匿跡，無形中不啻又打斷了產業界的一條生路。本月二日中央銀行行務委員會舉行會議時，聞該行當局曾對辦理生產事業緊急貸款的問題，有所商討，緊急貸款，型態上雖然是短期資金，但總比從地下錢莊處挪借的高利貸，要好得多，希望當局從速决定，以免生產專業的長期僵化下去。</p>
<p>工資問題，也是當前產業界感覺頭痛的一件事，現在儘管產品推銷不出去，原料補不進來，但是每屆朔·望，工資依然要想法準備起來；而且弄到頭寸不算，還要去忙現鈔，忙本票，忙銀元，在忙現鈔，忙銀元的時候，又非要先張羅到中央銀行的本票不可。總算錢都準備妥當了，勞方還要不滿意生活指數的計算，弄得辦工廠的事業家們都異常灰心；因而停工减產的現象，在在皆是。有時資金弄不上手　如果遇到勞資平時相處融洽，勞方同情資方處境的，還可牽延幾天發工資，或拿成品來作抵；否則，工潮的巨浪，或工廠的停歇，是不可避免的。再說工廠停歇，也不是一件簡單的事，必先準備好了足够的遣散費，和提供停歇的理由，才能應付多方的責難。</p>
<p>毫無疑義的，產業是國家的命脈，今日產業界已面臨了不景氣與極度不安的絕境，要復興民族，必須要珍視這一份的命脈。本市一向為全國工業的中心，本市的與衰，和經濟的榮枯。端賴當局着力扶持生產事業，况且本布六百萬人民中間，直接，間接，依附於工業生存的，確屬不在少數；而工業又是稅收的泉源，對國庫的影響，也屬不可忽視的。</p>
<h3>四强協定正式公布　解除柏林封鎖召開外長會日期確定　英美空運持續至局勢澄清</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林五日電〕官方今日宣布：美英法蘇四國已成立協定，依照規定，蘇聯應於本月十二日解除柏林封鎖，美英法對德境蘇軍佔領區之反封鎖亦同時結束。四國外長定本月廿三日在巴黎開會，討論有關德國各問題，包括柏林幣制問題在內。四國協定乃兩月來緊張談判之結果，協定在華盛頓·巴黎·倫敦·莫斯科與談判所在之紐約同時公布。全文如下：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯政府於一九四八月三月一日以來對柏林與西德間及東德與西德間之一切交通，運輸與貿易限制，當於一九四九年五月十二日解除。（二）美英法三國政府或其中任何一國，於一九四八年三月一日以來對柏林與東德間及西德與東德間所施一切交通運輸與貿易限制，亦於一九四九年五月十二日解除。（三）第一二兩條所述之限制解除後十一日，即一九四九年五月廿三日，四國外長會議應在巴黎召開，考慮有關德國之各問題及柏林局勢所引起之各問題，包括柏林幣制問題在內。協定副本一份於公布同時交與聯合國秘書長賴伊，並附有美英法之公函，要求以此事通告聯合國安理會。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播：貝文在下院中宣講四强對柏林問題之公報後稱，西方跟國之空運將繼續至柏林局勢完全澄清時為止，並謂渠將於週末前往柏林，老察空運情形。貝文繼稱，英政府歡迎此項協議，柏林居民，堅苦卓絕之精神實助成之。此項協議證明吾人向所採取之政策。實屬正當合理，今已收穫良果。英政府將以同樣堅忍之精神參加新外長會議，希望能在未來會議中覓致永久解决德國問題之基礎。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約五日廣播：成功湖訊，聯合國外交家對於粕林問題解决消息表示歡迎。中國駐聯合國代表蔣廷黻謂，此次解决條件與以前中立國委員會所提建議頗相近似，殊可欣慰云。</p>
<p>〔合眾社柏林五日電〕接近蘇聯軍政府之人士稱，蘇聯在解除柏林封鎖方面之第一步驟，將為要求舉行公民投票，以促成設立德國中央政府。據觀察家等談稱，實際上每一德人將贊成統一之德國。由於公民投票，傳蘇聯希望阻止成立西德國，並獲致在管制魯爾工業區之發言權。此說為德共公報所加强。公報籲請所有德人要求設立四佔區之中央政府，締結和約，撤退一切佔領軍。另傳蘇區內鐵路官員已奉命全日值班，理妥鐵道及火車，以備「大量」貨運之需。</p>
<h3>東西冷戰透露溫暖陽光　全歐洲人士騰歡　和平合作有賴今後努力</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕歐洲各國首都聞悉柏林封鎖即可解除之消息後，其歡欣不亞於一九四五年獲知二次世界大戰告終之時。倫敦外交界人士認為此一消息，係表示東西强國已在真正的努力恢復歐洲的和平空氣，己使冷戰最危險的階段為之結束。</p>
<p>蘇聯所控制的柏林電台於宣布該公報後，並作五分鐘短評，指出雙方最後卒獲以妥協的精神來處理柏林問題，此乃三年來最有希望的事件。倫敦巴黎華盛頓各報悉以最顯著地位，刋載此一重要消息，英國大部份報紙皆認蘇聯之同意解除柏林封鎖，决不可認之為一種奸計。美國務院發言人表示，外長會議召開時，蘇聯如能採取同樣願意合作的態度，則德國問題不難獲得解决。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓五日電〕美國會人士對四國解除拍林封鎖之協議表示樂觀，但略取保守態度。參院外委會主席康納利謂，此協議為「國際合作道路上前進之明證，余希望最後能解决德國問題」。民主黨參議員泰定謂，「此為一好消息，至少為一良好之開端」。參議員麥契昂指出解除封鎖將使美國卸去經濟上之重負，然謂「四國外長會議之結果，較此尤為重要，吾人須等待此會議獲得結果後，始可表示歡欣」。</p>
<h3>英美各報評論</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約五日電〕「紐約時報」今日對四國協議解除柏林封鎖事加以評論稱，「柏林封鎖之中止，並非神經戰已中止之謂。中國目下之情形，使人懷疑究竟何人正在獲勝此戰爭」。社論繼謂，「對鎖之解除，無疑證明西方各國在柏林及整個西歐之成功，此成功表示蘇聯對軟弱者雖任意加以阻撓，但在面臨堅决抗拒之意志時，即取因循態度。獲得此勝利，應歸功於西方各國各位創設及順利推行馬歇爾計劃之政治家，西歐之團結大西洋公約，及法義兩國無數抵抗共黨進展之男女，而駐德美軍總司令克莢堅持到底，進行空運工作而能避免不幸事件，亦為重要功臣之一」</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕倫敦各報對於四强同允解除柏林封鎖，一致表示滿意。惟其社評之措詞，頗為謹慎，皆謂解除封鎖僅為第一步驟，而蘇聯之誠意，須在未來之四强外長會議中證明之。</p>
<h3>克萊檢軍臨別致訓</h3>
<p>〔合眾社德國格萊芬震爾四日電〕卸任美駐德軍事總督克萊今日向其將士道別，參加惜別典禮之美軍計一萬一千名。克萊在檢閱臺上，似頗疲憊，作五分鐘之訓詞，語調充滿情感，聲音為之哽咽。詞畢，鳴禮砲十七響致敬。參加檢閱之軍隊中，包括坦克車二百五十五輛，從歐洲其他各地趕來之美軍將領卅六人亦在檢閱臺上，立於克萊之側，旋由繼任德境軍事總督之休伯納中將宣讀白宮接受克萊辭呈之文告，典禮遂告完畢。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓四日電〕關係方面透露：杜魯門總統及艾契遜國務卿正竭力敦勸國際復興銀行總裁麥克勞允諾担任第一任美駐德高級專員之職。</p>
<h3>駐奧蘇軍　司令易人</h3>
<p>〔路透社維也納四日電〕戰爭結束以來任蘇聯駐奧總司令迄今之柯拉索夫上將，不日將離奧，改任某要職。今日渠分訪其他諸强佔領軍總司令辭行。塔斯社謂繼任蘇駐奧總司令者為前駐匈總司令史維里道夫中將。</p>
<h3>英在太平洋區　無航空母艦</h3>
<p>海軍部次官對議員宣布</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕英海軍部拒不答覆議員所詢英艦隊在太平洋區域分佈之情形。保守黨議員卡本特，在下院中要求政府提出一九四九年四月廿日在太平洋區各級英艦之數字，並與一九四七年一月一日之數字相比較，海軍部次官杜格台爾拒不供給，指出如果發表，將與政府之政策不符。但渠告另一保守黨議員稱：自一九四七年十月以後，太平洋區即無英航空母艦在。</p>
<h3>英美正試騐　自動操縱火箭彈</h3>
<p>「路透社巴哈馬島那索五日電」政府方面權威發言人，頃證實美國方面所傳倫敦與華盛頓間正在進行談判，將在巴哈馬島試騐自動操縱火箭彈之報告。該發言人謂，該火箭彈將由一百二十哩外之無綫電台操縱，彈上不裝炸藥，僅裝導炸器，於發見該彈越軌時，即可用無綫電使其自行炸燬。</p>
<h3>柏林空運建殊勳　克萊功成身退值得稱譽　美英耗鉅貲飛行員四十七名捐軀</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林四日電〕美英對柏林之空運，今日已獲得最大勝利，蘇聯同意解除柏林陸地封鎖，此所謂有志竟成。空運當初僅為小規模應變之計，但十個月內竟成一種偉大事功。美國飛行員廿五名與英國飛行員廿二名因空運食物與煤至柏林而捐軀。美國所耗運費共一億五千萬元，英國所費數千萬鎊。</p>
<p>今日空運飛機照常出動，飛行員幾乎毫不介意紐約舉行之解除封鎖談判。下星期起，此輩殆可减少其奇異之冒險行動，而以大部份貨運交與鐵路及卡車，但空運之政治效果將垂諸久遠。一部份人相信共產主義已被阻於史比勒河（此河橫貫柏林市區）。蘇方從未想到美英能單用飛樣給養一個都市，蘇聯强迫美英建立並訓練堪稱歷史上承平時代最大空軍。不僅蘇聯懷疑空運之成功，即美英一部份當局亦然，唯有一人自始信其必能成功，即創議空運之德境美軍司令克萊。克萊已於明日功成身退。空運於去年六月某星期日下午開始，當時蘇聯封鎖柏林西區之水陸交通，並宣布不再給養西區市民。克萊當即呼召駐韋斯巴頓鎮之航空部隊並召見參謀長。克萊提議空運糧食至柏林，參謀長一口答應可運六十噸，但克萊要運五百噸，參謀長為之乍舌。德境當時僅有雙引擎輕運輸機隊，但仍毅然一試。數小時後，戰痕斑斑之奮式C47到運輸機自機場出發飛往柏林，寒暑不停，再接再厲，直至今日。</p>
<h3>南韓開森城北部　突遭北韓軍襲擊</h3>
<p>陸軍部宣布已予以擊退</p>
<p>〔合眾社漢城五日電〕南韓陸軍部五日宣稱：北韓軍隊兩批於四日携有日砲及機槍，越過北緯卅八度之美軍區向漢城西北五十哩之開森城（譯音）之北部襲擊，但皆被南韓軍隊擊退。據稱：第一批北韓軍隊約二百名，自蘇聯控制區出擊，遭南韓軍兩營擊退。第二次又有北韓軍隊三百人，後又增援五百人進攻同一地區，亦被擊退。南韓軍隊死一人，傷十二人。北韓軍隊進攻之初步目的未明。一般僉信，北韓軍隊可能之目的，在奪取俯視開森城之山頭。該山頭位在分隔南北朝鮮之北緯卅八度上。此項戰爭於四日下午六時卅分結束，南韓軍隊「完全控制大局」。</p>
<h3>荷印間談判　將屆結束階段</h3>
<p>深信前途尚有暗礁</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞四日電〕荷蘭與印尼共和國在聯合國主持下，在此進行的非正式談判，將於本週內達到結束的階段。荷首席代表范樂楊，印尼首席代表羅姆，兩星期來曾努力就下列諸點企圖獲致協議：（一）印尼共和國所得行使主權的程度；（二）荷蘭之要求印尼共和國接受停戰令之約束；（三）在海牙召開圓桌會議之時日及條件。印尼代表團代表之一那齊爾今日已辭去代表職。據云，係印尼代表團內部意見分裂之表示，因此有人相信，印荷談判前途可能尚有暗礁。</p>
<h3>美配給荷蘭軍火　將移用對付印尼</h3>
<p>印尼駐美代表主予以防止</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約五日電〕印尼共和國駐美代表蘇米特洛今日宣稱，北大西洋公約配給荷蘭之軍備，荷蘭可移用之以對付印尼，一如其利用經濟合作總署援助之款，進行殖民地戰爭。今後運交荷蘭之美國軍火，雖可嚴密管制其用途，惟已在荷軍手中者將不受管制，荷蘭新近派赴印尼之援軍，决非不帶武裝者。美政府方面前曾宣稱，美國供應北大西洋盟約國家之軍火，將令其祇供本國防禦之用，如荷蘭及法國，不能以此移用於印尼及越南。如有遠反此條件者，美國有權停借軍火。國務部為增强此項政策，傳正嚴重珌慮在軍火合同中加入一條，規定不能利用美國軍火以騰出其本國軍火，轉運他處。</p>
<h3>比眾院批准公約</h3>
<p>〔聯合社白魯塞爾四日電〕比利時眾院今日以一三九對廿二票，批准北大西洋條約，該約尚須由參院批准。</p>
<h3>英聯邦各國贊同　以軍火援助緬甸　印瑞友好條約正式換文</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦五日電〕官方人士今夜稱，英國與不列顛聯邦其他數國，或即將以軍火與現款接濟緬甸，此乃最近聯邦會議中所决定，澳洲，印度，巴基斯坦，紐西蘭等均贊成支援緬甸。</p>
<p>〔路透社伯爾尼四日電〕印度總理尼赫魯與瑞士外長貝蒂比埃，將於五日在此交換兩國友好條約之批准文件，該約計九款，於去年八月十四日在新德里簽字，為印度獨立後與外國所締第一次條約。俟換文後，條約即開始生效。</p>
<h3>杜爾斯出席參院作證　擁護大西洋公約　强說太平洋防禦重要性</h3>
<p>〔聯合就華盛頓五日電〕共和黨要人杜爾斯今日在參院軍委會稱：美國倘不批准北大西洋條約，則戰爭極其可能。杜氏間接暗示太平洋之防禦，與大西洋同樣重要。據稱，史達林曾於廿五年前宣布革命的勝利，繫於殖民地與附庸國家之革命。史氏特別提及中國與印度，謂此種言論一日為蘇聯共黨聖經之主要部份，吾人一日不應忘却。</p>
<h3>法審理法奸工作　已幾告結束</h3>
<p>特別法庭下月將取消</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎五日電〕戰後法國處置法奸之工作，至今日已幾告結束。國民議會已在討論一宗法案，規定於六月一日起廢止解放後所設審理法奸罪之各特別法庭，僅專門審判前維希政府內閣人員及高級官員之高等法庭仍繼續保存。至一九四八年為止，高等法庭審判人犯共五十七名，內缺席審判者十六名，其中被判死刑者十八名，內有十名係缺席判决死刑者，已執行者為維希總理賴伐爾，秘密警察苜領達南，維希駐佔領區代表白里農，其他貝當元帥，及海軍總司令拉鮑特之死刑改為無期徒刑，國務員梅辛，司法部長台拉斯之死刑，均改為終身苦役，維希駐叙利亞司令鄧資，死於獄中。</p>
<h3>匈保羅違反和約　美將採行動</h3>
<p>艾契遜招待記者表示</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓四日電〕國務卿艾契遜今日在每週招待記者例會上發表聲明，添露美國即將就匈牙利保加利亞羅馬尼亞三國遠悖和約中人權條款之事，採取行動。渠透露自匈牙利明真諦樞機主教被判刑及保羅等國排擠教士及反對黨之事件發生後，美國曾發表譴責之聲明，三國竟予拒絕</p>
<h3>「我選擇了自由」　將搬上銀幕</h3>
<p>原作者克拉夫金科宣布</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕「我選擇了自由」一書作者克拉夫金科，今日在此向記者談稱，渠擬將該書內容搬上銀幕，作為一部清脆誠懇具有人性的劇本，不具任何宣傳作用。換言之，即同情俄羅斯而反對蘇維埃。克氏又曰，渠更擬將該書編成無綫電劇本。渠尚擬完成另一著作，然後返歸故鄉，渠特別强調重返故國之點，此事何時始能實現雖不可知，但若一日不實現，其生活即無意議可言。克氏鄭重否認，渠與任何右翼或反動集團有關。渠頗贊成英國之社會主義政府。談及東西間之冷戰時，渠認為未可樂觀，蓋柏林問題的妥協，不過是向正在燃燒中的火焰澆下一滴冷水，今後必將更有驚人的事件發生</p>
<h3>英格麗褒曼　决與夫仳離</h3>
<p>兩人吻別時不禁淚下</p>
<p>〔路透社西西里島巴萊莫四日電〕好萊塢瑞典籍影星英格麗褒曼與其夫林治特隆博士，今日在此間吻別時，兩人均不禁淚下。被稱為英格麗新愛人的義籍導演羅賽里尼，以及許多攝影記者均在場目擊此一幕動人的場面。英格麗等三人，昨夜曾與律師一人，在西西里梅西那之皇家旅舍內舉行談判，今晨英格麗與其夫即在旅舍前含淚吻別。林治特隆為洛杉磯醫院外科主任，乃奢名腦科專家，渠於獲悉英格麗有嫁羅賽里尼之意後，特自洛杉磯趕來，英格麗與其夫別後，即偕羅賽里尼同舟赴史特隆波里島繼續拍攝影片，林醫師則搭機返美。關於昨夜在旅舍中之談判結果，傳說不一，有謂英格麗已與其夫妥協，一說英格麗與林治特隆已决定離婚。然據此間影界人士稱：好來塢影業巨頭休斯，亦即英格麗現在義國所拍影片之主特人，因不滿英格麗與羅賽里尼之戀愛，已决定中止贊助拍攝該片。影界人士又指出，該片原係由好萊塢另一影業巨頭米高梅老闆高爾溫贊助，惟高氏與羅賽里尼一度晤談後，即决定撤銷其贊助。</p>
<h3>英國工黨</h3>
<p>— 勃萊斯福著　宋桂煌譯</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰期內，國際勞工黨因為反對帝國主義之故，吸引了左翼中的許多自由主義者。它既有了這班生力軍！所以它的外貌上便含着自由主義的傳統，即人道精神，願意接受對方的意見，在國際的或帝國的糾紛上尤然。後來自由黨中因阿斯奎斯與路易喬治發生紛歧而頻於瓦解的時候，比較進步的自由分子便紛紛投入工黨方面。其結果之一，便是漢德森的看出了必須修改工黨的憲章。一直到一九一八年，中等階級分子之欲加入工黨者，總還需要先行取得為國際勞工黨或費邊的黨員的資格。結果，担任宣傳及競選的工作者，便是國際勞工黨。但在這一年，在每個選區內，總有一個黨的支部與工會分會相併存。同樣重要的一事，便是不論用手工人或用腦工人均得入黨而無歧視。今日工黨的政治機構即由此而擴大其基礎，並且至一九三二年，國際勞工黨即從其中退出，真是幸事。</p>
<p>全國性的組織</p>
<p>在這些早期的孕育時期，工黨係由一個小團體演變出來，其本來目標是在促進手工工人的特殊利益，使結合成一個政黨，期其以全國為規模，能够參與政治。現在工黨的黨員和選民，大多數仍是手工工人，其經費大部分即係由黨員徵集而來，每次舉行年會，總能號召大多數的黨員。但是全部情形，尤不止此。政治組織與教育工作，係交付於選舉區所管轄的黨部，而中等階級及在這些黨部中頗有勢力。這些黨部領導着國際勞工黨初期所有的一種傳統的社會生活與服務。這些，都是其他政黨中所無者。其中含有反對國教的教徒的作風，其每星期日晚會中，實秉含着宗教與政治的氣味。</p>
<p>在工黨之親密的同志關係中，階級的差別不久便消退了。在一百年以前，馬克思曾說，無產階級除其鐵鍊外，別無他物可失，但是無產階級在英倫三島上已經絕跡了。今日，無產階級都是膚色黝黑，但是你們必須到非洲及仰度去找求他們。前後有六七十年的光景，手工工人賴乎魯斯金學院之助，實行自我教育，俾便擔負其責任。結果是，在以上半世紀中勞工運動的主要物中，能力的水準乃得逐漸提高，在議會中佔第一席。它雖於下一代人士的理想主義，其中不少科學家，詩人，技術家及醫生。今日，它已代表全國半數人民發言。它在下院中的議員，其背景最為複雜。在前列議席中，貝文，倍文與辛式爾，都係出身於手工工人；莫理遜是一個商店僱員，亞歷山大係出身於合作運動中，而艾德禮，達爾頓，及貝格是倫敦經濟學院的講師，克里浦斯則是一個著名律師。（一續）</p>
<h3>歐洲憲章完成簽署　統一歐洲理想漸成事實　准希土參加與否尚待最後决定</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕歐洲十國今日在此簽訂歐洲議會的章程，使數世紀來統一歐洲的美夢向事實更接近了一步。在倫敦聖詹斯宮中，閃爍的燭光之下，歐洲的領袖政治家一一簽字於此一歷史性的歐洲憲章上。英外相貝文於簽字時致辭，表示歐洲對歐洲議會之興趣，不亞於大西洋公約，乃趨向統一歐洲願望最重要的一步。憲章內容今夜即可望公布，其中規定歐洲議會總部設在法國斯特拉斯堡，並明示歐洲議會係屬咨詢性質，其任務以不妨碍聯合國憲章為原則。關於希臘土耳其能否參加歐洲議會之點，將待十外長作最後决定。比利時駐參英大使代表史巴克外長加簽字。</p>
<h3>市長盃女循環决賽　綠隊黎隊先後奏捷　男子落選複賽東華半分洶汰莆田　今夕約翰民立爭奪女組落選錦標</h3>
<p>市長盃籃球女子循環决賽兩場，及男子落選複賽一幕，昨日下午五時起在體育館舉行，觀眾千人，情况尚不寂寞，首場女組黎隊對鷹隊，裁判吳效堤吳子彬，陳文談錢楚屏為黎隊罰開紀錄，鷹隊黃品珍破網各二平等，第一節五比五勝負未分。第二節開始，競爭仍烈，迭造平等，鷹隊以盧金華替黃品珍鑄下大錯，黎隊乘機而起，乃以十七對十三結束前半時。休息後戰成拉鋸，廿比廿五時，鷹隊王燦華五次犯規被黜，不久三節終了，鷹隊廿一，黎隊廿五。最後一節，楚屏順手迭建功勛，鷹隊賴罰球得點，曾追至卅一對卅三，但自蔡明霞投入後，未幾時聞已屆，黎隊以卅六對卅一力取鷹隊。</p>
<p>繼之女組綠隊對雅隊，由吳詩鑑劉荷生執法。綠隊阿媛單臂首開紀錄，孫鳳竹別而未人，明媛再加二只，朱錦芸一罰，綠隊以七比〇遙領，迨錢夢月邊綫建功，第一節終，二比七雅隊落後。第二節綠隊劉珍寶代曹曼麗，氣勢益盛，十五對四時，阿媛足傷小休，曼麓上場，雅隊亦以朱蘭貞調汪澤綸，上半時終結，綠隊以十七對九佔先。易籃後，雙方陣綫均變動，雅隊疲態畢露，綠隊暢所欲為，第三節綠隊廿九，雅隊十分。末節雅隊朱家珍犯規畢業，綠隊調上陸惠君伍美牟，仍能操縱裕如，迨終場鐘聲響處，綠隊以卅七對十一克雅隊。</p>
<p>末場男子落選賽，東華對莆隊，裁判黃存瑞劉荷生。接觸後，陳祥龍先中，莆隊陳文藻，田兆麒兩入，周達　遠進，各四平等。東華達云連入，以十對七前進，莆隊不甘示弱，趙桂泉黃文澄雙管齊下，苒造各十二平手。莆隊發奮，以廿三對十七抬頭，及祥龍托中，前半告終，東華以十九比廿三屈居下風。</p>
<p>休息再戰，東華以賈幼良易下陳祥龍，莆隊仍一路前導，東華李垚調幼良，一度以廿七對卅一接近，惟莆隊不肯放鬆，瞬又以卅六對廿七佔先九分，東華作困獸之鬥，不久果以四八對四五超出，時間完了，東華卒以五十一對五十半球之差險勝莆隊，將與健樂爭取落選錦標。</p>

<h3>乙組乒乓爆出冷門　紅白擊敗種子凌隊</h3>
<p>今日續有乙組五場角逐</p>
<p>四屆乒乓聯賽，前日甲組華美對郵乙，郵務臨時因郵務球室另有應用不克比賽，故雙方同意改期。另幕乙一部紅白出戰凌隊於國貨球室，紅白為聖約翰學生軍，出戰四次，兩勝兩負，已失入選希望，凌隊乃該部種子，五仗皆捷，寶力殊强，此役紅白健兒咸抱置生死於度外，戰來異常努力，凌隊雖以二對一佔先，不幸第四組金士聖以一對二為紅白隊長董紹龍所敗，造成緊張局勢，末組决戰凌隊主將戎文邦劇戰對方健將李傳祺，戎疏於練習擊來野球甚多，傳祺奮戰不懈，終以直落二戰勝戎文邦，結果紅白以三對二擊敗種子凌隊，堪稱一幕冷門爆出之傑作。茲錄兩隊戰績如下：</p>
<p>（紅白）　比　　　（凌隊）</p>
<p>蔡森甫　十一—廿一　廿一—十六　十六—廿一　冀如棠</p>
<p>周知行　廿一—十八　廿一—十九　張岳甫</p>
<p>姚紀梅　十三—廿一　十六—廿一　葉壽昌</p>
<p>董紹龍　廿一—十八　十八—廿一　廿一—十八　金士聖</p>
<p>李傳祺　廿一—十九　廿一—十九　戎文邦</p>
<p>今日（六日）續有乙紙五場角逐，郵務球室已改在樓下近門口之消費合作社內照常比賽，希今日兩場輪值隊注意。主辦當局盼勝隊於翌日速將紀錄表送交聯賽辦事處，以利進行。茲探錄今日秩序如下：</p>
<p>育才—郵三（乙三）五時半郵務</p>
<p>海光—中機（乙一）七時正郵務</p>
<p>凌雲—郵思（乙一）七時正郵思</p>
<p>新星—美並（乙三）七時正金門</p>
<p>健新—凌隊（乙一）七時正國貨</p>
<h3>九洲磐隊足球改期　今日中藝華光交鋒</h3>
<p>昨日九洲與磐隊之民主杯足球賽，因雨絲斷斷續續，米曾舉行，但場地並不泥濘。如今日天氣放晴，則中藝與華光之戰，將於下午四時半在南市球場準時踢出，裁判員馬友于，巡邊員倪世耀嚴有庚。中藝為南市「地頭蛇」，現亦保持不敗紀錄，且曾以三比一壓倒三星，及二比二迫和龍頭，所餘勁敵只九洲與華光二隊，故抱有奪杯雄心。今日與華光一戰，關係十分重大，中鑿如能取勝，則能與該隊一較高低者，僅九洲一隊矣。然華光為一慣戰能征之雄師，前鋒既皆行動快速，衛綫更為堅强，而吳祺祥之一雙大脚，尤足陰遏攻勢，故踢得來勁時，能使任何强隊低頭，實不易對付。這一場球的贏輸，大有苗頭可別。（如天時反常，可電詢〇二—七〇七四六）</p>

<h3>工商各業瀕臨崩潰　呼籟糾正公用指數　參會小組明商討抑平辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公用事業計價指數連日狂漲，市民均已不勝負担，市參議會公用小組會，已定於明日（七日）下午三時，在參議會舉行小組會議，商討合理之抑平辦法。據悉：某數參議員以公用指數之不斷激劇上漲，直接間接對市民已發生最嚴重最惡劣之影響，决將於明日會議席上，仗義執言，為七百萬市民請命，堅决主張取銷公用指數，以解民困，而安定社會秩序。又據聞，三四與各公用事業機關有關係之參議員，（公用局職員及水電機構之主持人）屆時並將自請迴避，以杜社會之指責云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自公用指數不斷狂漲，威脅全滬七百萬市民生計，逼使大小工商各業瀕臨崩潰危機，影響社會安定之後，各界首長無不重視。經濟部簡次長貫三亦深感公用事業指數每日增高，確使全體市民不勝負担，各工廠尤感無法應付，蓋生產既遠遜於前，而運鎖復越趨困難，枯窘之狀與日俱增，長此以往，後果恐將不堪設想，認為此一問題，實屬嚴重萬分，故特函陳市長轉飭公用事業各單位，迅予妥商改善辦法，俾减輕人民與工業界之負担，以維生產而資安定。</p>
<p>市商會，各大麵粉工廠，機器染織業公會，對此一問題，均有迫切之呼籲，市公用局，英商自來水職工亦各來函有所解釋</p>
<p>市商會昨電呈京滬杭警備總司令部，淞滬警備司令部，上海市政府，請迅籌有效處置，力予抑减。電云：據本市旅店商業同業公會支代電內開，公用事業計價指數，日日猛跳，我各會員店，即將營業總收入，亦不堪應付，僅電費一項，已超過總收入數倍，窘困萬狀，（各店被迫為雖實情，均可派員抽查），倘各水電公司因欠費即斷水停電，而發生一切問題，當由各該公司負責，理合電請轉呈軍政各主管當局鑒　，萬急萬感等語到會。查公用事業獨自創造所謂計價指數。每日將價格狂漲，實為任何都市所未有，並為凡頁事業之創格。</p>
<p>一月電費動輒數十億就旅業一業而論，據報戲以揚子飯店為例，上月份全月營業收入，僅十七億元，而應付上月份電費，依七十九萬倍計，即達四十二億元。又就工業而論，報載永豐義記染織廠，應付上月份電費，以七十九萬倍計，即達四十六億元之鉅，電費如是，其他水費電話費，無一不然，此種狂潮，如不力為遏止，則全市工商業，惟有破產，以付公用事業之用，公家捐稅，工人薪給，俱無所出，即此一端，已足使本市立陷於崩潰，此實剝膚之災，萬不容於漠視，應請鑒核，迅作公平有效之處置，力予抑低，萬勿任其竭澤而漁，以全市工商業為殉，曷勝迫切待命之至。</p>
<h3>市總工會呈請當局　制止公用指數上漲</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕本市公用事業公司收費逐日公佈之公用事業指數上漲甚烈，市總工會特呈請市政府市參議會迅予制止。茲錄原呈如下。「查最近一週來日用品等價值已趨平定，本月初發表之指數，結果亦未發生刺激作用，現地方當局正着手研討工資計算標準，以期勞資雙方得以維持，詎公用事榮本（五）日公佈之計價指數為九十五萬倍，全市數十萬工人所得之工資僅三十七萬倍，與之相較，將超出三分之二，公用事業顧名思義攸關社會公眾生活，與一般營利事業不同，竟有如是獨時之指數，顯然剝奪公眾之生存，復查電力·電燈·電話·自來水等公司，所有外籍及本國一部份高級員司薪給，均按美金計算，處於中國境內享受之優厚實超諸達官富賈以上，比來百物價值普跌，獨公用事業價值上漲，若不立即採取有效之制止，則全市公眾無法生活，且社會秩序益難維持，而工商各業亦將迫其早日倒閉。憶前公用事業欲以關元計價，曾蒙市參議會予以制止，公憤始平，茲者又復巧立名目，遺害無窮，為特迫切具文，呈請俯賜迅予制止實為公便。」</p>
<p>自來水公司職工亦深受暴漲影響</p>
<p>署名上海英商自來水公司一羣職工來函略稱：「公用事業職工一般之底薪均較低，上月每人支得工薪不過六百萬元，且公司對於同人所用自來水并無優待，故實際同人等亦深受自來水價格暴漲之嚴重影響，以計薪指數卅七萬倍計算，同人等薪金所得應為二千餘萬元，而水費至少須付一干餘萬元」。查工人工資既低，公司開支節省，公用指數更無逐日上漲之理由，在自來水公司服務之職工尚身受水費過高之影響，一般市民之痛苦更可想而知矣</p>
<h3>汪維恆接長財局　昨舉行交接典禮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政局代局長錢健夫，奉調上海市銀行副總經理，局長一職，由市府遴派汪維恒少將接充。新舊任局長交接典禮，於昨日上午十時半在該局會議室舉行，各科室主管職員等百餘人均參加。儀式簡單隆重，十一時廿分禮成。</p>
<h3>陶一珊昨日蒞新　陳保泰下週接事</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕新任民政局長陶一珊已於昨日下午二時正式蒞局視事，新任社會局長陳保泰則定下週一正式接事。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕新任教育局長趙家麟定今日到市教育局接辦移交。</p>
<h3>按行莊隔夜有款額　中央銀行十足撥現</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀錢信託三業，昨起一律不再開發本票。已發本票，則儘量收回。同時，中央銀行為配合行莊需要週轉之籌碼起見，昨起開始按各行莊隔夜在國行存款額，十足撥現，計分船洋三成（每枚作價四百萬元），現鈔三成半，國行定額本票三成半。故昨起各行莊已能充份應付客戶提現之需要。</p>
<p>保付支票照常發行</p>
<p>又據銀行公會某負責人語記者：昨日各行莊停發本票伊始，因國行已能充份撥現，故各行莊應付客戶需要經過情形頗屬良好。至於銀錢同業間通用之同業保付支票，因僅係在業內週轉之用，與本票性質截然不同，故同業間遇有需要，仍照常發行云。</p>
<h3>四月份三聯配米　展延至十日截止</h3>
<p>據民調會息：四月份第三聯計口配米，因運費過鉅，一時籌措不及，原寫延期至五日截止，茲因該項配米，尚有一部未及出倉啟運，為顧及一部份市民購取配米起見，特再延期至本月十日止。又該處五月份計口配米，米源已大部籌足，五月份第一期計口配米，待四月份第三期配米結束後，即可開始發配。</p>
<h3>每週出口結匯額　不到二百萬美金</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕據悉：上月份上海全月出口結匯總額為美金七百七十一萬五千三百卅五元一角六分，較三月份低落甚多，每週出口數字平均不到二百萬美元。</p>
<h3>强盜殺人　三犯執行槍决</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警局繼槍决圖謀不軌主犯童柏扶後，昨日午後三時復在閘北大通路槍决强盜殺人犯顏金祥（廿八歲鹽城人），夏一飛（廿七歲鹽城人），羅文祥（廿四歲鹽城人）等三名。查顏羅二犯係於上月八日合夥搶刦大統路普慶坊九十號李胡氏家，拒捕開槍，當時率警前住兜捕之閘北分局派出所巡官王傑因此中彈殉職。事後經警局派員　緝，先後拘獲顏金祥等廿四名，經分別偵訊後，得悉內中顏及羅文祥二犯即為當時拒補槍擊五巡官之兇手。至夏一飛則為曾於去年十月八日搶刦大統路八二二號時開槍擊斃事主談世發之要犯。警局以際茲戒嚴時期，自不能容此輩目無法紀胡作妄為。除將嫌疑犯吳金如等廿一名依懲治盜匪條例懈送法院訊辦外，特將為首犯有强盜殺人罪之顏羅夏三犯處以極刑。經由警局呈奉淞滬警備部核准後，綁赴現場執行槍决，以昭烱戒。</p>
<h3>蓮花寺內破獲不法團體　主犯童柏扶槍决　百餘從犯將予從輕發落</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警察總局於上月廿六日根據黃浦警分局長馮文曉之報告，在成都南路蓮花寺破獲冒稱所謂「總統府第一社會監察組」圖謀不軌之非法秘密團體，當場拘獲主犯童柏扶及從犯劉玉崑等一百〇五名，抄出長短槍械廿一支及偽造印信文件多種。經偵查結果，該犯已供認不諱，當經呈准淞滬警備司令部依據上海市緊急治安條例第二條第七條之規定，處以極刑，於昨日上午十時，將童犯騐明正身綁赴蓮花寺前執行槍决。</p>
<p>從犯百餘多係受騙</p>
<p>至從犯劉玉崑等一百餘名，則均係無知青年被騙入局，情有可原，聞毛局長悉將予以從輕發落。按主犯童柏扶，現年卅八歲，湖南人，自冒稱「總統府第一社會監察組」名義成立非法團體後，一般無知人民參加者頗眾，一因該組織以總統府名義頗為動聽，一因該組織發給之所謂「調查證」內列有持證得免費乘坐國營飛機及各種車船，持證得出入娛樂場所戒嚴地區要塞堡壘地帶等荒謬詞語。</p>
<p>實際目的斂財謀反</p>
<p>惟實際其目的在於斂財，及共匪攻滬時謀作策應工作。此外該組織竟膽敢公然向警備部，市政府，警察局等機關行文要求供給調查資料，黃浦警分局長於接獲此項情報後，以該團體名義前所未聞，即據情密報毛局長，經向總統府探詢並無此等組織後，遂由刑事處派第五科姚科長負責偵查，並派員暗中參加該組織擔任組員。四月廿六日獲悉該組織在蓮花寺召開秘密會議，乃派遺大批員警馳往將主從犯一網打盡。</p>
<h3>證交暫行停業</h3>
<p>證交昨起暫行停業，據該所當局透露：此次暫停時間，並不為長，預料一週以後，即可恢復，俾便各種股票市價，能藉此得重約改訂，以便配合市勢。</p>
<h3>棉紗銷呆平　十六支粗紗獨俏</h3>
<p>棉紗昨市平穩，各紗微見上升，惟實銷清淡，四十二支藍鳳價與昨日午收相同，無上落，金城七四〇〇〇萬，微升二千萬，四十支藍鳳七二〇〇〇萬，上升一億元，卅二支各檔，微升一千萬，廿一支雙馬棧單做四七〇〇〇萬，現貨五一〇〇〇萬，均升三千萬。廿支各升二千至三千萬，十六支買氣獨旺，銷路較各紗活絡，升二千萬，十支各檔一致帶俏。</p>
<p>棉布徘徊</p>
<p>棉布因有南運開放之消息，廣帮稍有動辦，市勢在穩檔徘徊，場外喊做，四君子嗶嘰授受轉稀，細布喊做頗為閙忙，低檔細布脚地尤堅，同業以拆放停頓，出貨進現及出現進貨交易絕跡，故大量成交至為稀少。</p>
<h3>食米市勢堅俏</h3>
<p>食米市勢轉挺，到貨日見减少，售樣不多，米店添納尚殷，市勢堅俏，價格上升，南市場白粳二千二百萬，薄稻二千二百八十萬元，各比上日漲一百五六十萬元，早稻漲一成多，做二千二百萬元，秈米便較低，碾秈一千九百萬元，北米市場白粳二千二百萬，漲一成，交易不多。</p>
<p>食油價格上挺，本街續有吸納，銷路甚暢，豆油最高曾達一億元，收市九千二百萬，計漲六百萬元，生菜油最高八千四百萬，收市七千六百萬，軋漲八百萬元，吉桶生油八千四百萬，亦漲八百萬元，小車蔴油七千二百萬元，豆餅仿未開。</p>
<p>麵粉市勢以圈外各物一致報漲，人心轉堅，散戶吸取甚力，價格普跳二成，老車晨開五百四十萬，中市供貨殊稀，成交極少，後市以五百八十萬高價做開，兵船五百二十萬，紅蜂四百八十萬，麩皮亦昂，阜豐大包四百四十萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧全面上升，冬豆乍豆均做千五百萬，較上日跳起二成光景，桑園豆去化極暢，昨市升達千六百萬元，蠶豆再挺二成，斜橋揀青三千七百五十萬，生仁漲勢亦勁，芝蔴苞米紅糧一致上揚。</p>
<p>茶市略軟</p>
<p>茶市自買戶咸懷袖手旁觀後，交易杳然，趨勢久若靜止狀態，昨日市上，更因　雨連綿，市面倍覺凄涼。而向貨方探問行情，則仍維持原價，惟脚地稍形軟化。</p>
<h3>黃金低檔盤旋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市况，仍萎靡不振，盤旋下檔，蓋行莊本票已不能開發，交易無形中已變為現鈔，及定額本票，故實際上已由本票價變為現鈔價，各方對於警備部之緊急條例，咸具戒心，若干字號，均已暫停買賣，改營金銀交換生意。</p>

<h3>建議組織合作社　接辦各公用事業　王曉籟為廠商市民請命</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕水電等項公用事業計價指數日來瘋狂上漲，廠商小市民均感不勝負担。中華國產廠商聯合會理事長王曉籟氏，有鑒於此，特建議組織合作社，予以接辦，俾作合理經營，為人羣謀幸福。茲探錄原函如下；「上海市政府，上海市參議會，上海市商會，上海市工業會公鑒：查地方公用事業尤其是水·電·電話，應由市營為不易之定理。即退一步言，水·電·電話至少應由用戶組織合作社來經營，使個體經濟進為集體經濟。由於公用事業係屬獨佔事業，應為最大多數人謀最大幸福，設任令私人經營，自必以營利為目的，而不能為最大多數人謀最大幸福。例如水電電話像用針管刺入人家作輸血之手術，使人家滿足生活過程之需要，同時作抽血之手術，使人家日漸消瘦，而至於死亡。上海在生產發達經濟繁華之時，雖此種抽去之血，其利益多於輸入之血，但以失之東隅，可以收之桑榆，故多不覺其損害之鉅。而今上梅之生產幾趨於停滯，經濟幾瀕於枯竭，公用事業之費用，尤其是水電電話費用，却依然如以前發達繁華之日，予取予求，宜乎用戶都無力負担。五月五日各報所載之情形僅豹之一斑而已。當然公用事業費用之指數獨立而日長夜大，為原因之一，惟其最根本之原因，則為私營獨佔，無法節省，無法替代之故。因此根本解决祗有收回市營，退求其次，應即由用戶聯合起來，組織合作社接辦，以達到「我為人人人人為我」之目的，庶可為最大多教人謀最大幸福。為特肅電奉陳，諸維亮察進行，全滬市民實深利賴，中華國產廠商聯合會理事長王曉籟。」</p>

<h3>粵省防水與造林</h3>
<p>— 黃晃</p>
<p>〔廣州廿八日訊〕廣東水患嚴重，洪區遼闊，談防水者，多注重築圍，由於築園工程淺明，功效易見，故急功近利，捨疏濬而趨築圍，殊不知築圍固屬重要，蓋因重築而輕疏演，輒因灑流積淤關係，河床日淺，勢必影響河流水位較高，若水拉高則要圍堤隨而較高始能防水，如圍堤愈高，而又積淤水疏，勢必促使河床更淺，如此循環影響年深代遠，常致河底高於圍堤，若遇洪潦汹涌，或堤基稍弱，卽易崩潰，於是圍內人畜，盡成魚鼈，一發不可遏止，抑有進者，河之兩岸，堤圍甚多，何止千數，堤基自必強弱不一，高低不一，基固者，基強者，基高者，固可倖免於難，是時水勢所趨定就其基弱者，基低者，而摧毀之，迫得各圍競相固基修堤，以自保衛，耗財費力，民不寗息，而仍終日惶惶，恐懼水串，故必需同時有計劃的疏濬河道，清掃淤積，使水順流暢，洪潦減威，再加以圍堤相範，則廣東防水問題，自易解決。</p>
<p>復次，粵省河流，因上游多屬崇山峻嶺，下游均屬坦盪平原，而中乏湖沼調節江水，故稍遇山洪暴發，便一瀉千里，洪潦成災，是以廣東防水策略，除上述之疏濬河道，及下游修築堤圍外，應注意在上·中·兩游多多興築閘壩，修塘建湖，以調節洪水，含蓄水量，以稍殺洪潦凶威，應幾水災得以減免。</p>
<p>造林為根本防水法之一，無如森林之利益防水之効果，非一蹴卽見，每為人民所忽視，執政者更無心及之，雖高瞻遠矚之政治家，心知森林之重要，極力提倡，中國且定有植樹節，惜後之執政者，絕少衷心奉行，無非敷衍故事，循例舉辦，并無切實造林，試問定有植樹節凡數十年，年年植樹，空間植有多少？抑不獨植樹數量少得可憐，且植後旣無撫育，又無保護，生者亦僅若絕處逢生，僥倖生矣，未及成材，經已慘受樵蘇之採伐，更受軍隊之摧殘，以故年年植樹。無一成林，試觀全省之公有林場，何者不林相零亂，樹木凋殘？足為明證。縱使人民之私有林場，間有成林者，亦僅純為經濟林，殊少防水林，卽均以經濟為出發點而造林，絕少以防水為出發點而造林，雖則造林為好事，姑不論以何者為出發點，亦均與國計民生有利，與防水防旱有益，但究不若注重防水林，使旣獲木材之利益，亦收調節水旱之功能，又有防水之効果，實為針對本省水災頻盈之對症良方，以故普通造林之學理，已有專章，是以不論，茲只論防水造林如左：</p>
<p>河堤造林</p>
<p>河堤造林與防水，至有密切關係，蓋因河堤林之効果至大，其犖犖大者如（一）涵蓄水源，扞止流沙，使河床淤積減少，（二）調節旱潦，使農作物生產增加，（三）增加河堤覆蓋物，保持水土，避免河堤崩潰，傷害沿岸耕地，（四）調節河流水量，防止河水時溢時竭，免影響一切水利，（五）澄清江水，遏止山洪暴發現象避免潦水災害，（六）調和氣候，增加堤岸風景等，其餘直接間接之利益，不勝枚舉，或謂河堤造林，其利雖普，且廣東常有颶風來襲，恐搖撼堤林，危害堤基，未見其利，反見其害，殊不知河堤造林，若零星栽植，風大林少，或有此弊，設若整個河堤造林，使堤林盤根錯節，相互緊抱，風力雖大，亦無傷害，惟最應注意厥為河堤林之樹種問題，應擇幹靱葉小，根鬚繁密，耐風耐濕者為宜，是以河堤造林若能愼選樹種，普遍栽植，實有百利，而無一害，觀乎蘇聯在伏爾加河，頓河，尼褒河及烏拉河等各流域，均在沿河兩岸造林禁伐，足為證明，反觀本省各江流域，兩岸羣山環繞，大都童山濯濯，各江沿岸，崩山疊見，山土流沙，淤積河床，此所以水患之由來也，故今後應倡導河堤造林，有計劃的在各江沿岸，分站普設苗圃，凡上中游兩岸山野，一里內及下游各基圍普遍造林，以利防水。</p>
<p>水源造林：查本省各江幹支流水源，除西江外，均在本省境內，而各流上游，又多屬崇山峻嶺，面積遼寬，降雨量自大，而又無森林以資含蓄，阻緩雨水奔逸，故稍降大雨卽山洪暴發，釀成水災，民謠之所謂「南雄洒濕石，曲江高三尺，清遠過屋脊」足以充份表示水源毫我含蓄之現象，證諸事實，北江上游大雨，一日抵曲江，又一日抵英德連江口，再兩日達清遠，可知該民謠，非全虛謬，亦卽足以證明水源造林之重要性，故廣東欲根治防範水災必須在各江幹支流水源舉辦水源造林，而原有各水源之天然林，必須加以管理實行封山，嚴禁樵伐，防範焚山，俾能成為各水源之「無形水庫」，以防旱潦，實為廣東防水基本之圖。</p>
<p>沙防造林：廣東之防水造林，除上述之河堤造林，水源造林外，尙須注意，「沙防造林」始能完備，所謂沙防造林者，係指在各江幹支流離岸十里內劃為「防沙區」，在「防沙區」內凡崗嶺荒山，必需完全造林，意者，使沿河兩岸陸上之雨水，必需經過林木澄清沉積作用，然後流入河內，藉避免山土流沙淤積以，利河水流暢，防免水災。</p>
<p>廣東為中國唯一之亞熱帶區域，地味深厚，民豐物阜，獨惜水災頻盈，實為本省天然環境之最大缺憾，故必需防範水災，防災之法，最好防水與造林，兩者并重，標本兼施，互相為用，冀能消彌水災於無形，憶筆者去年考察台灣時，覺台灣之氣候，土質均甚惡劣，且雨水失調，風災劇烈，較諸廣東，廣東可謂天獨厚矣，而能以人工補天然之不足，興建水利，撫育森林，增加生產，改良農業，遂有今日中國寶島之稱，茲以廣東天賦天然環境之優越，而加以為之建設，豈有不能成為完美的南天樂土乎？</p>

<h3>靈甫號在廣州　輪機久未擦油　砲彈已經生銹</h3>
<p>〔廣州三十日訊〕自三月廿七日突然奉海總命令，從上海駛來廣州白鵝潭海面停泊的靈甫號軍艦，她的行蹤，頗使此間人士大惑不解，目前長江防務如此緊張，何以像靈甫這樣的軍艦，也會離開崗位？記者曾在卅一日晨登該艦訪問，由該艦艦長鄧天杰，副長何樹鐸接見。上艦時，記者看到艦上的員兵，散散漫漫的俯伏在欄杆邊，看着海水，態度頗見沉郁。據艦長和副艦長說：靈甫號是去年在英和重慶號贈艦一齊駛回中國的。當時駕駛靈琢軍艦的，就是現任的靈甫艦長，他們對於重慶艦的起義，都感到有難以宣洩的苦悶。他們說：我們和重慶艦的官兵，一齊在英國受訓，私交是很好的，回國以後，我們駐防長江，重慶艦駐防北方，隔別數月，到他們走了以後，我們才曉得，至於他們為什麼走？走了以後怎樣？我們的感想如何？我想這是社會人士一定關心的，可是，從重慶艦走了以後，我們就是有感想也不敢說了，我們只能夠表示：像重慶艦這樣的結果：喪在自己砲火底下，未免可惜而已。艦長又說：來廣州之前，我們原在長江擔任防務，重慶艦走了以後，一席調守上海，後來又調駐廣州。目前我們的任務是擔任訓練華南區的海軍，什麼時候會走，他們也不曉得。現在艦上共有官兵約二百人，百分之九十以上是原來在英國受訓的舊兵，只有二十名新兵是派來艦上訓練的，艦上官兵的籍貫，浙江，江蘇和兩湖的佔最多數，福建，廣東的比較少。艦長是福建人，副艦長是浙江人。關於艦上官兵的待遇問題，艦長說：和一般部隊差不多，總是無法維持目前的實際生活，副艦長還慨歏着廣州的物價太貴了。</p>
<p>記者參觀了艦上一過，看見許多艦上的機器許久沒有擦油了，看得見有些鐵銹在上面。尤其是艦頭艦尾那四門主力砲的砲彈，彈頭也有些生銹了。</p>
<h3>汕頭風　人肉比不上猪肉</h3>
<p>〔汕頭廿八日電〕汕頭的中級公務人員，目前祇拿到一千幾百元的月薪，一月辛勞所得，換到十市斤白米而已，他們道地是「枵腹從公」。國稅稽征局一部份職員，就為了待遇過份菲薄，十四日起開始怠工。</p>
<p>百業蕭條，惟煙酒店的生意卻獨旺盛，洋煙洋酒的銷路甚暢，五十支高夫力，海軍之類的香煙賣一千三百元，抽吸者大不乏人，低級公務員如須應酬，一月薪水，恰好買一包香煙。</p>
<p>理髪店的價格，屢屢更改，自農曆年底到現在，從五十，一百，一百五，二百而漲至五百元，不少人因其突漲得厲害，身邊帶不足五百元，以致當場感到尷尬不堪。市政府社會科雖屢予「申誡」，然該業對於法令一致弁髦藐視，遂使一般市民，俱為三千青絲而困惱。</p>
<p>繼十，十一兩日之後，十六日之市場又見混亂，港幣入晚漲至四四〇元之高峯。永平路，永泰路以及小公園前之「牛」市場，分外熱鬧。</p>
<p>汕頭有電影院四家，目前最高票價一百四十元，由於近來人口的激增，每場各院都告客滿，看霸王戲有槍階級固然不少，但情形不若上海廣州各地的嚴重，這也許是軍隊和傷兵倒尙少之故。</p>
<p>自京滬各地高等難民擁到後，汕頭淳樸的風氣，已受「海派」的影響而漸變為奢華，賣從香港走私而來的洋貨商店或攤頭，有如雨後春筍，西裝革履的紅男，以及着尼龍絲襪披皮大衣的綠女，日見增多。</p>
<p>汕頭雖沒有營業舞廳，但聯誼社與海關俱樂部每逢週末必有舞會舉行，朱門巨室也多有「派對」，衣香鬢影，酣歌抱舞，充溢着一派滅亡前夕的狂歡。</p>
<p>隨着物價高漲，生活維艱，私娼的數目也遽見增多。入夜中山公園羣鶯亂飛，兜攬狎客，一夜消魂之值甚低，人肉的價錢，在汕頭尙比不及猪肉。</p>
<p>港報在汕頭的銷數共五千多份，近因航運抵汕較早，價格也不比汕頭報紙來得貴，故訂閱的人日見增多，眼看着汕頭報的銷路天天走下坡。</p>
<h3>臺灣新軍中的女兵</h3>
<p>〔臺北廿八日訊〕屏東市西北角一片蕉林的前面，新修建起兩列灰色磚瓦的營房，這地方從前是日本空軍的官舍，作戰期間被美機炸毀了，現在陸軍訓練司令部鳩工修整，在一片荒涼的敗磚瓦堆中，重新砌起了兩列簡陋營房。</p>
<p>營房裏面，前幾天來了一百幾十個摩登女郎，她們是陸軍訓練司令部新由京滬杭各地招來的女知識青年，大多數是中學生，也有幾個曾受過大學教育，她們離鄉背井，由遙遠的家鄉，渡海來到這亞熱帶孤島的南部，接受特殊訓練，準備肩負起對國家的新使命。</p>
<p>這羣女孩子，由上海坐船到臺灣，在基隆上岸後：沒有久停就大車載到屏東來，她們分別由學校和家庭自願的跑到兵營來，開始這一種不太自由的團體紀律生活，但是堅強的意志和自信心，終不能完全湮沒原有的天真。當記者通過森嚴衛兵綫的盤查和指引到達營房去訪問她們的時候，她們之中有些沉不住氣，已經在叫苦了，她們帶着幾分嬌羞嬉皮笑臉的告訴記者說：「我們沒有自由，我們看不到報紙，我們不能隨便出門」。</p>
<p>她們到屏東沒有幾天，甚少與外界接觸，她們和記者見面的時候，多以奇異的目光注視着一個好像對她們十分陌生的人，當她們獲悉是記者來訪問的時候，她們更興高彩烈，有些上海來的小姐們，尤其顯得親切，她們爭着用上海話的語調和記者說東道西指天說地。</p>
<p>她們雖然已經穿上淡綠色的制服和短裙，但各式各樣的鞋襪，和各種各式的頭髪，還掩不住她們是從都市來的小姐，她們有的仍然燙着蓬鬆捲髪，有的載着探近視眼鏡，有的是學生姿態，有的像深閨小姐，簡單的營房裏，一切還未佈置就緒，木板地上舖着一條軍毯，就是她們睡覺休息的地方。她們唯一的消遣，就是和同志姐妹們談，記者問她們想不想家，她們說想家就不來了，問她們吃不吃得飽，她們說吃得飽，可惜菜少了些，聽說她們離開上海的時節，她們的不少家長，開着小包車，哭哭笑笑的趕到碼頭來追她們回去，但是這些倔強的小姐們，寗願犧牲她們家庭的溫暖，來接受吃苦的訓練，這種精神實在動人。</p>
<p>她們之中的一個隊長告訴記者說她們都是沒有結過婚的小姐，因為上級規定不收已婚女性，這次在國內各地招考的女生，人數共四百人，將成立一個大隊，集中在屏東訓練，現在到的僅是一個先頭部隊，因為她們剛到沒有幾天，一切還沒有就緒，營房設備，生活管理，都顯得零亂，她們規定十三日起開始受訓，訓練課程除基本軍訓和體育活動外，主要是政工救護和情報工作的技能訓練，訓練期間一切軍事管理。孫立人將軍對這羣女孩子們的生活和訓練非常注意，對教官人選尤其慎重，隊部上下服務官佐，甚至勤務雜役都決定一律雇用女性，總隊長人選，聽說仍在孫立人將軍慎密遴選中。</p>

<h3>Attempted Landing by Over 100 Communist Boats Repelled at Liu River Estuary; Communication Severed on Zhegan Railway Along Hengfeng, Yiyang, and Yingtan; Communist Troops Flee North from Wangjiangjing North of Jiaxing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Military sources released the following war situation at 9:00 PM on the 5th:</p>
<p>(1) A small number of Communist activities were discovered near Xiaoshan this morning. Our defending troops are conducting a strict search and suppression.</p>
<p>(2) More than two thousand bandits on the 4th infiltrated from Leping towards Hengfeng, Yiyang, and Yingtan, disrupting communication by destroying local power lines.</p>
<p>(3) Today at 3:00 AM, over a hundred bandit boats attempted to land at Fanzhai, Liu River Estuary. Upon discovery by our defending troops, they were bombarded with intense artillery fire, sinking over a dozen ships. The remaining vessels retreated northward.</p>
<p>(4) A unit of over one thousand from the 23rd Communist Army, which had infiltrated Wangjiangjing north of Jiaxing, retreated after being intercepted by National troops.</p>
<p>(5) Since being invaded by the bandits, the various counties in southern Anhui have engaged in large-scale plundering. The civilian food supply is almost depleted, with even the last remaining dou of rice being subjected to a 50% levy. Young men are forced into the army, and elderly men are also conscripted to organize stretcher-bearer teams or transport teams, compelled to go to the front lines. Local Communist elements are intensifying their actions, carrying out liquidation struggles. Anyone with even a little knowledge or a small amount of property is labeled a stubborn element or a bourgeois, and becomes the target of liquidation struggles, with no one spared. Good and honest people, unable to bear the bandits' brutal oppression, willingly endure the pain of displacement, with countless numbers fleeing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Military sources reported at 10:00 AM on the 5th:</p>
<p>(1) At 6:00 PM on the 4th, over a thousand bandits, divided into two groups, infiltrated Zhitang and Zhoushu north of Taicang. A strong unit of our defending troops was dispatched to intercept them, resulting in fierce fighting. Over a hundred bandits were killed or wounded, and twelve were captured. The remaining bandits, unable to withstand the assault, fled northwest.</p>
<p>(2) Over a hundred local Communist elements infiltrated Maojiashi north of Taicang on the evening of the 4th, destroying the town's power lines. After a sweep by our defending troops, the bandits fled east towards Ludu.</p>
<p>(3) Tongxiang Chongde, southwest of Jiaxing, was infiltrated by local Communist elements on the evening of the 4th, disrupting communication by destroying the telegraph lines. Our troops are currently searching and suppressing them.</p>
<p>(4) It is reported that Guan Wenwei, the commander of the 10th Communist Army Corps who entered Wuxi, has established a military control committee in Wuxi, with Guan himself serving as the chairman.</p>
<h3>House of Commons Opens Debate; Britain Adopts Non-Intervention Policy on the Situation in China; Conservative Party Suggests Signing a Pacific Pact</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's dispatch] London, 5th (broadcast): The debate in the British House of Commons on the situation in China was opened by Minister of Defence Alexander. He stated that the British government adopts a non-intervention policy towards China and does not wish to be drawn into the vortex of the Chinese civil war. However, Conservative Party members demanded that the government take certain measures to curb the expansion of communism in the Far East. Conservative Party member Macmillan suggested signing a Pacific Pact to curb communism. He demanded that the government make it clear that any attack on Hong Kong would be regarded as an act of aggression. Macmillan warned that the Communist authorities in the Kremlin might temporarily suspend their expansionist efforts in the West in order to seek more favorable achievements in the East.</p>
<p>According to Alexander, Britain will send army, navy, and air force reinforcements to Hong Kong to defend against possible Communist attacks. These reinforcements include infantry, tanks, field artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, fighter planes, cruisers, and aircraft carriers. Alexander also revealed that Britain has established a new defense line in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] When the House of Commons debated the China issue on the 5th, Prime Minister Attlee is expected to issue a warning to the Chinese Communists, stating that Hong Kong is British and that Britain will spare no expense to ensure that it remains British. Attlee will also discuss Britain's policy towards China, even to the extent of describing the nature of the relationship that the British government will establish with the Chinese Communists, stemming from the Amethyst incident. Both London and Washington diplomatic circles are awaiting this statement from the British Prime Minister with great interest. It is generally expected that Attlee will not express radical opinions. However, British government officials have not made a statement regarding their policy in China, and due to the recent rapid changes in the situation in the Far East, domestic and foreign figures have been requesting the British government to make a clear statement as soon as possible. The United States' new policy towards China is also yet to be determined, so Attlee's statement should be given the closest attention. Related sources revealed that since the incident of the British warship being shelled in the Yangtze River, there has been closer contact between the British and American governments regarding the situation in China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] Defence Minister Alexander announced that when the House of Commons debates the situation in China and the incident of the Chinese Communists shelling British warships in the Yangtze River on the 5th, the government will take the opportunity to make a statement on the defense of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th] Conservative Party leaders are preparing for the debate on the China issue on the 5th of this month, advocating for concerted action with countries in the Far East that have interests and are threatened by the Communist Party. Conservative Party figures stated: "The international Communist Party has won a significant victory in China, and the British government has not fully understood the extent of this victory." In the debate on the 5th, the Conservative Party will argue that "if the entire Far East is not to be trapped, an active policy and concerted action should be taken." According to the Conservative Party's view, security seems to depend on the development of regional defense measures. Countries on the edge of the danger zone may join these measures, including Australia, New Zealand, Malaya, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Siam, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th] Churchill and the Conservative Party prepared on the 4th to launch a fierce attack on the Labour government's Far East policy when the House of Commons debates the situation in China on the 5th. Prime Minister Attlee will preside over this comprehensive debate and will make a statement on behalf of the government, which Churchill will respond to.</p>
<p>Among the list of questions that members of parliament have submitted to the government, the most important is whether Hong Kong can be defended as the Communist army sweeps across China. The government has refused to disclose the strength of the British Far East fleet, but has agreed to answer questions about Hong Kong on the 5th.</p>
<p>After 42 British sailors died in the Yangtze River conflict, public anger demanded an immediate review of the government's Far East policy, and a date for the debate was set. At that time, the government requested that the debate be postponed to the 5th.</p>
<p>Naval parliamentary representative Dugdale has bluntly rejected the Conservative Party's request to list the British warships in the Pacific at the time of the Communist attack on the Amethyst. He also opposed the government's policy of disclosing "defence information." Under repeated questioning, Dugdale admitted that there has been no British aircraft carrier in the Pacific since October 1947. Churchill and his Conservative Party subordinates will attack the government for not having an aircraft carrier in the area when the Amethyst was bombed.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Hankou, 5th] Transportation sector sources: Passenger and freight traffic on the Yuehan Railway is showing an abnormal phenomenon.

<h3>Central Government Discharged Employees Request Change to New Standard for Payment of Fees; Executive Yuan Secretary-General Huang Promises Immediate Discussion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] The Executive Yuan passed the measures for discharging surplus personnel from various central government agencies on April 16. It stipulated that the discharge fee should be based on the April index (120,000 times), paid for three months' salary, public expenses, and in-kind compensation, and stipulated that all payments should be cleared before April 30 so that all discharged employees could return to their hometowns as soon as possible. The payments have been delayed until now, and some have not been paid in full, and some have not been paid at all. Calculated at the currency value at that time (April 30), the total discharge fee could be about 100 silver dollars. Now that the authorities have issued large banknotes and state-owned enterprises are charging in silver dollars, causing the gold yuan to depreciate sharply, the discharge fee that the discharged personnel, who are at a loss, should receive is only a few silver dollars at the current market price, which is not enough to cover the cost of the journey home. If used to support a family of several people, it would only be enough for three or four days of food in today's Guangzhou. Therefore, the discharged employees gathered in the afternoon of the 5th to discuss the matter. It was resolved to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to pay the discharge fee in accordance with the method of paying public employees' salaries at the market value of Customs Gold Units passed on the 4th of this month. Representatives of the Social Affairs Department, the News Bureau, the Police Department, the Population Bureau, and the Labor Bureau, Ding Wenan, Luo Luohou, Yang Liezu, Xu Kehuang, and Zhou Wenyuan, went to the Executive Yuan to visit Secretary-General Huang Shaogu, and presented the document. Huang expressed great sympathy for the discharged personnel and promised to convene relevant agencies to discuss improvement measures that day.</p>

<h3>The Peculiar Phenomenon of Housing Shortages in Paris</h3>
<p>— Xi Lan</p>
<p>[Paris, 27th Dispatch] In Paris, a salaried worker pays only one franc per month for rent, enough for a family of six to live in. A moderate apartment with three or four rooms costs only two francs per month (equal to ten packs of the cheapest cigarettes). The usual rent ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 francs per month. High-ranking officials or important figures pay only 3.5 to 8 or 10 francs per month.</p>
<p>This situation seems excellent, but there is a very bad side to it because houses are never vacant, no one moves out, and landlords cannot evict tenants. Newly married couples cannot find houses to live in, so they must live with their parents or their wife's family. In Paris, virtually no new houses have been built in the past twelve years.</p>
<p>The only opportunity to get a house is when people die.</p>
<p>When someone dies, you can try to rent the deceased person's room. Therefore, behind a frail and declining old man basking in the park's sunshine, there is a young wife discussing with his landlord about taking over his room. Others deal with funeral homes to make connections.</p>
<p>There are two ways to rent an apartment after someone dies. One legal way is: if you can meet certain preferential conditions, you can get a chance to requisition it, but often several people can meet these conditions, so this route often doesn't work. The other way is illegal but the most reliable: negotiate with the deceased's heir, and immediately move some furniture in after the person dies. Once you step into that house, you are a god.</p>
<p>To find an apartment, it costs about 500 to 1,500 francs a month. Therefore, salaried workers should abandon the idea of living in large houses; they can only live with their families in dilapidated hotels.</p>
<p>There are about 84,000 houses in Paris, almost 90% of which were built before World War I. Even officials estimate that 16,000 are dilapidated and need to be demolished. The rest are not necessarily satisfactory. 82% of Parisian houses have no bathrooms, and more than half of the people have to go outside to use the toilet. Only slightly more than one in six houses even have running water and are considered complete by government inspectors.</p>
<p>Most landlords don't have the money to maintain their properties, let alone improve them. Here's an example: a woman owns three houses with a total of 34 rooms, all rented to middle-class families. After paying taxes and repair costs, her rental income not only has no surplus, but she loses 80 francs a year. Her son has to support her and take out 80 francs to pay her taxes, but she cannot sell the houses because no one wants to buy them.</p>
<p>If you want to stop repairs and recover some money, that's impossible. An owner once failed to repair his property on time, causing rain to damage some of his tenant's armchairs. He was sued and had to pay compensation and a fine. Rents in Paris have increased sixfold since 1914, but taxes have increased 13.2 times, and repair costs have increased 120 to 150 times from their 1914 value.</p>
<p>The French Parliament has spent much time trying to solve this complex problem. In fact, since the liberation, the law allows landlords to increase rents, but retail prices have risen much more. Simply put, rents for new houses (built after 1914) are allowed to increase only tenfold compared to before World War II, while rents for old houses (nine out of ten houses are old) are allowed to increase by 12% compared to 1939, or 7% compared to 1914.</p>
<p>If a new building were built today, the landlord would probably charge ten to thirteen times the current rental value to break even. Therefore, according to a report by the French Economic Bureau, the current rental value for a house with three rooms and a kitchen for a salaried worker is 13 to 16 francs a year, which would increase to 166 to 200 francs a year in the future. A French observer said: Even so, no one would want to build new houses.</p>
<h3>Chennault's Speech at the U.S. National Press Club: America Has Only Three Paths to Follow Regarding China: Indifference, Appeasement of the Communists, or Immediate Aid</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] General Chennault told reporters and government officials on the 4th that the time for America to make a decision on China is now, or it will be too late.</p>
<p>Today, 750 people crowded into the spacious room of the National Press Club to listen to Chennault's speech, almost breaking a record. Chen said that America has only three paths to follow regarding China: (1) Indifference, (2) Appeasement of the Communists, (3) Immediate Aid.</p>
<p>Chen reiterated his remarks to the Senate Military Affairs Committee yesterday, describing the vastness of southwestern China, saying that if given aid, China could hold the southwest to resist the Communists. However, after delivering his prepared remarks, Chen suggested in response to questions: (1) Provide direct military and economic aid to the Nationalist government, but with direct American supervision over the use of this aid at the upper levels of the Chinese government. He made a similar suggestion last year regarding the $125 million military aid program, but the supervision clause was ignored at that time. (2) The United States should assure the Nationalist government of moral support so that they can "organize and fight under one banner." (3) If the United States remains indifferent or engages in appeasement, it will only result in the Communists conquering all of China and eventually conquering all of Asia.</p>
<p>Previous Military Aid Failed to Arrive in Time Chen explicitly denied that China had received $2 billion in usable American aid, and stated that no part of the military aid under the $125 million program fell into the hands of the Communists. One reason was that the military aid did not arrive in China in time. If the Communists seized any military aid, it must have been "seized in the Pacific or in San Francisco because military aid never arrived in Shanghai before the fall of Xuzhou." (Note: It was previously reported that American military equipment shipped to China was diverted to Taiwan.)</p>
<p>When asked if he knew the contents of General Wedemeyer's long secret report, Chen replied that he did not, but secretly suspected that the report recommended aid to China.</p>
<p>Chen strongly praised Wedemeyer, saying that Wedemeyer's actions while commanding the U.S. China Theater were exactly what was needed. Chen twice caused laughter in the audience. He said that he "had to consult with a lawyer" before answering whether he had obtained the approval of the War Department before publishing his recent book, "Way of a Fighter," and the audience laughed. When asked if his remarks today had been approved by the Secretary of Defense before being delivered, Chen gave the same answer, and the audience laughed again. (Note: Secretary of Defense Johnson recently ordered that speeches or writings by retired military officers must be reviewed by the War Department before publication.)</p>
<p>Very Few Usable Surplus Materials Remain in the Pacific</p>
<p>When asked whether China had received $2 billion in aid since the Japanese surrender, as reported by the State Department, Chen replied that China had never received any aid that they could use. The American side estimated the value at $860 million, but most of the surplus property that the Chinese side tried to obtain from the Pacific islands was unusable and much of it was resold to the United States as scrap metal. Of the military equipment given to China by the United States, very little was usable by China. China had to buy Mosquito bombers from Canada because they could not obtain the necessary aircraft from the United States. Furthermore, China could not obtain spare parts or .50 caliber machine gun bullets for the aircraft they already had. Before the Pearl Harbor incident, the United States sold scrap metal and oil to Japan while giving China moral support, which still helped China fight. Today, this kind of moral support would be most effective.</p>
<p>When asked why, if President Chiang and the Kuomintang members were ineffective, not try new leaders, Chen replied: "If new leaders can be found, this may be a good idea. However, China has tried to find a new leader and failed. As far as he knows, the United States has no secret agreement to assist the Communists.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Millions of People in Government-Controlled Areas Are Willing to Fight the Communists</p>
<p>Chen repeatedly emphasized that hundreds of millions of people in non-Communist-controlled China are prepared, able, and willing to fight the Communists. Muslims in the Northwest have vowed to fight the Communists to the death and have repeatedly defeated the Communist army. The garrison in China's "Pittsburgh"—Taiyuan—has demonstrated a good example of the Chinese people's fighting spirit. Taiyuan was besieged for months, subjected to intense bombardment for ten days, its fortifications were completely destroyed, and the entire garrison was wiped out before it fell. They fought extremely bravely because they had been shareholders in the province's enterprises for many years.</p>
<p>When asked to estimate China's needs for fighting, Chen replied that General Stilwell had estimated that 2,000 tons of small arms ammunition could equip a Chinese division for six months of combat.</p>
<p>Chen believes that the possibility of America doing business with the Communists is very small, saying that the Communists will allow the United States to sell certain urgently needed goods, but under strict control, until the Communists can obtain these goods elsewhere, at which point they will no longer allow the United States to sell them.</p>
<p>Acheson Told Reporters that the State Department's Attitude Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Secretary of State Acheson told reporters that the State Department's attitude remained unchanged—that continuing aid would be a waste.</p>
<p>Senators Mundt and Nolan said they were preparing an amendment to revise the Arms Act to provide aid to China.</p>
<p>Acheson declined to comment on Chennault's remarks yesterday.</p>
<p>Nolan had recently requested that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigate the US government's "delayed" China policy, but Committee Chairman Connally said that European problems came first, "Besides, we have heard a lot about China." Nolan said that the committee had taken no action on his request, so he had to try to include China in the Arms Act. To obtain all relevant information on the situation in China, he had requested that the Senate Military Affairs Committee invite General Wedemeyer to testify before the committee after Chennault.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Value Production Enterprises!</h3>
<p>In a turbulent situation, production enterprises are hit first and suffer the most. This situation is felt more deeply and severely in this city! Because the production enterprises in this city are dependent in nature, raw materials and fuel must rely on other production areas, and the sales of products must also rely on other markets. When transportation is inconvenient, the impact is significant. Recently, since the Communist army moved south, transportation to and from this city has been almost completely cut off, resulting in the disruption of supplies, the stagnation of product sales, and the paralysis of the entire production sector.</p>
<p>In recent years, various regions have suffered the destruction of war, and people's purchasing power has weakened to the extreme, which is an unexpected blow to the outlet of industrial products. Now that the flames of war directly threaten Shanghai, if Shanghai becomes a battlefield, it will not only be impossible to engage in reproduction, but even the little remaining industrial equipment may not escape ruthless destruction. A few days ago, the Chinese Institute of Engineers issued an urgent appeal, asking the authorities to protect production equipment and not allow the surviving production equipment to be swallowed up by military forces again, to leave a bit of vitality for the country and the nation, and to leave a glimmer of hope for the production sector on which people's livelihoods depend. These words are full of blood and tears, how sad and how earnest! For the sake of our descendants for thousands of years, we must also cherish and protect this only production industry in the country.</p>
<p>In the past, our main production enterprises were mostly in the hands of foreign merchants with strong financial resources, and the domestic production industry was根本unable to compete with them, resulting in a colonial economic state. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, when foreigners' special rights in China were cancelled, far-sighted and enthusiastic national industrialists devoted themselves to the construction of the production industry. Unexpectedly, the civil war followed, making it impossible for the production industry to raise its head, especially the heavy taxes, which made the production industry unbearable. The phrase "虚盈实税" (virtual profit, real tax) has exhausted the pain suffered by the production industry in paying taxes. However, although the environment at that time was quite恶劣, the production industry could still struggle hard, such as developing Nanyang trade, implementing north-south material exchanges, and other methods to enable the production industry to barely survive to this day, but now even these small roads have been blocked off, and the future of the production industry, even if it is not destroyed by砲火, I am afraid it will be suffocated to death.</p>
<p>Another major difficulty of the production industry is the problem of raising funds. As is well known, industrial funds require long-term funds, but under the current situation, the value of currency changes daily, and floating funds are mostly entrusted to underground money houses, becoming the capital of speculators who buy and sell short. Who is willing to provide long-term loans? And even if factories can barely borrow money, the heavy burden of interest is not something that factories engaged in production can afford. Even if there are, they are only a kind of behavior in which the production industry drinks poison to quench its thirst when its capital turnover is not灵敏. In the past, the production industry also relied on low-interest loans from national banks to maintain its operations, but since the situation became tense, this kind of loan has disappeared, virtually cutting off another lifeline of the production industry. When the Central Bank's Executive Committee held a meeting on the 2nd of this month, it was reported that the bank authorities had discussed the issue of emergency loans for production enterprises. Emergency loans, although in the form of short-term funds, are still much better than the high-interest loans borrowed from地下钱庄s. It is hoped that the authorities will make a decision as soon as possible to avoid the long-term僵化of production specialization.</p>
<p>The wage problem is also a headache for the current production industry. Now, despite the fact that products cannot be sold and raw materials cannot be replenished, wages still have to be prepared every time朔望 comes; moreover, not only do we have to get到头寸, but we also have to忙cash, 忙bank notes, and 忙silver dollars. When忙cash, 忙silver dollars, we have to first张罗to the Central Bank's bank notes不可. Even if all the money is prepared, the labor side will still be dissatisfied with the calculation of the cost of living index, which makes the entrepreneurs who run factories extremely discouraged; therefore, the phenomenon of停工减产is everywhere. Sometimes funds cannot be raised; if the labor and management have a harmonious relationship and the labor side sympathizes with the capital side's situation, the payment of wages can be delayed for a few days, or finished products can be used as抵; otherwise, the huge wave of labor unrest, or the停歇of factories, is不可避免. Furthermore,停歇of factories is not a simple matter. Sufficient severance pay and reasons for停歇must be prepared first in order to respond to all parties' accusations.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that industry is the lifeblood of the country. Today, the production industry is already facing a绝境of recession and extreme不安. To revive the nation, we must cherish this lifeblood. This city has always been the industrial center of the country. The prosperity or decline of this city is related to the prosperity or decline of the economy. It is up to the authorities to vigorously support the production industry. Moreover, among the six million people in this city, there are indeed quite a few who are directly or indirectly attached to industrial生存; and industry is the source of tax revenue, and its impact on the national treasury should not be ignored.</p>
<h3>The Four-Power Agreement is Officially Announced: The Date for Lifting the Berlin Blockade and Convening the Foreign Ministers' Conference is Confirmed: British and American Airlifts Will Continue Until the Situation is Clarified</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 5th] Officials announced today that the four countries of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement. According to the agreement, the Soviet Union will lift the Berlin blockade on the 12th of this month, and the retaliatory blockade of the Soviet military occupation zone in Germany by the United States, Britain, and France will also end at the same time. The foreign ministers of the four countries will meet in Paris on the 23rd of this month to discuss various issues related to Germany, including the Berlin currency issue. The four-power agreement is the result of two months of tense negotiations. The agreement was announced simultaneously in Washington, Paris, London, Moscow, and New York, where the negotiations were held. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All traffic, transportation, and trade restrictions imposed by the Soviet government since March 1, 1948, between Berlin and West Germany and between East Germany and West Germany shall be lifted on May 12, 1949. (2) All traffic, transportation, and trade restrictions imposed by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, or any one of them, since March 1, 1948, between Berlin and East Germany and between West Germany and East Germany shall also be lifted on May 12, 1949. (3) Eleven days after the restrictions mentioned in Articles 1 and 2 are lifted, namely May 23, 1949, a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries shall be convened in Paris to consider various issues related to Germany and various issues caused by the Berlin situation, including the Berlin currency issue. A copy of the agreement was handed over to UN Secretary-General Lie at the time of publication, along with a letter from the United States, Britain, and France requesting that this matter be communicated to the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: Bevin said in the House of Commons after announcing the four-power公报on the Berlin issue that Western countries' airlifts will continue until the Berlin situation is completely clarified, and said that he will go to Berlin on the weekend to老察the airlift situation. Bevin continued, that the British government welcomes this agreement, and the spirit of柏林residents'坚苦卓绝has really helped it. This agreement proves that the policy we have adopted is正当reasonable and has now收获good results. The British government will participate in the new Foreign Ministers' Conference with the same坚忍spirit, hoping to find the basis for a permanent solution to the German problem at future meetings.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] New York, 5th Broadcast: Lake Success News, UN diplomats welcomed the news of the solution to the粕林problem. Chiang Ting-fu, the Chinese representative to the United Nations, said that the conditions for this solution are very similar to the recommendations made by the previous neutral country committee, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 5th] People close to the Soviet military government said that the first step the Soviet Union will take in lifting the Berlin blockade will be to demand a referendum to promote the establishment of a German central government. According to observers, virtually every German will support a unified Germany. Through a referendum, the Soviet Union hopes to prevent the establishment of West Germany and gain a say in the control of the Ruhr industrial area. This statement was strengthened by the German Communist 公报. The公报called on all Germans to demand the establishment of a central government in the four occupation zones, the conclusion of a peace treaty, and the withdrawal of all occupying forces. It is also reported that railway officials in the Soviet zone have been ordered to be on duty all day to理妥the railways and trains in preparation for "大量" freight transport.</p>
<h3>The Cold War between East and West Reveals Warm Sunshine: All Europeans Are Rejoicing: Peaceful Cooperation Depends on Future Efforts</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The joy in the capitals of European countries upon hearing the news that the Berlin blockade would be lifted was no less than when the end of World War II was learned in 1945. London diplomatic circles believe that this news indicates that the Eastern and Western powers are making real efforts to restore a peaceful atmosphere in Europe and have brought the most dangerous stage of the Cold War to an end.</p>
<p>After announcing the 公报, the Berlin radio station controlled by the Soviet Union also made a five-minute short commentary, pointing out that the two sides finally reached a compromise spirit to deal with the Berlin problem, which is the most hopeful event in three years. The major newspapers in London, Paris, and Washington all刊载this important news in the most prominent position. Most British newspapers believe that the Soviet Union's agreement to lift the Berlin blockade should never be regarded as a conspiracy. A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said that if the Soviet Union could adopt the same willing attitude of cooperation when the Foreign Ministers' Conference is convened, the German problem would not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Members of the US Congress expressed optimism about the four countries' agreement to lift the blockade of拍林, but took a slightly conservative attitude. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally said that this agreement is "clear evidence of progress on the road to international cooperation, and I hope that the German problem can be resolved in the end." Democratic Senator Tydings said, "This is good news, at least a good start." Senator McMahon pointed out that lifting the blockade would relieve the United States of an economic burden, but said, "The results of the four foreign ministers' meetings are even more important than this. We must wait for the results of this meeting before we can express our joy."</p>
<h3>British and American Newspaper Commentary</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 5th] The "New York Times" commented today on the four-country agreement to lift the Berlin blockade, saying, "The cessation of the Berlin blockade does not mean that the war of nerves has ceased. The current situation in China makes people wonder who is winning this war." The editorial continued, "The lifting of the blockade undoubtedly proves the success of the Western countries in Berlin and throughout Western Europe. This success shows that although the Soviet Union arbitrarily obstructs the weak, it takes a循循attitude when faced with the will to resist resolutely. Credit for this victory should be given to the politicians of the Western countries who创设and smoothly implemented the Marshall Plan, the unity of Western Europe, the Atlantic Treaty, and countless men and women in France and Italy who resisted the progress of the Communist Party, and General Clay, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army in Germany, insisted on carrying out airlift work to avoid unfortunate events, which is also an important功臣."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] London newspapers unanimously expressed satisfaction with the four powers' agreement to lift the Berlin blockade. However, the wording of their editorials was quite cautious, all saying that lifting the blockade was only the first step, and the Soviet Union's sincerity must be proved at the future four-power foreign ministers' meeting.</p>
<h3>Clay's Farewell Address</h3>
<p>[United Press, Grafenwöhr, Germany, 4th] Outgoing U.S. Military Governor of Germany Clay bid farewell to his soldiers today. 11,000 American troops participated in the farewell ceremony. Clay, on the review stand, seemed quite疲惫. He gave a five-minute speech in a tone full of emotion, his voice哽咽. After the speech, 17 cannon salutes were fired to pay tribute. The troops participating in the review included 255 tanks. 36 American generals who had rushed over from other parts of Europe were also on the review stand, standing beside Clay. Then, Lieutenant General Huebner, the successor to the military governor of Germany, read out the White House's statement accepting Clay's resignation, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] Related sources revealed that President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson are doing their best to persuade International Bank for Reconstruction and Development President McCloy to promise to serve as the first U.S. High Commissioner to Germany.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Commander in Austria Changes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 4th] General Kurasov, who has served as the Soviet commander-in-chief in Austria since the end of the war, will soon leave Austria to take up an important position. Today, he visited the commanders-in-chief of the other major occupying forces to bid farewell. TASS said that the successor to the Soviet commander-in-chief in Austria is Lieutenant General Sviridov, the former commander-in-chief in Hungary.</p>
<h3>Britain Has No Aircraft Carriers in the Pacific Region</h3>
<p>Navy Undersecretary Announces to Parliament</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th] The British Admiralty declined to answer a parliamentary question regarding the deployment of British naval forces in the Pacific region. Conservative MP Mr. Carpenter, in the House of Commons, requested the government to provide figures for all classes of British warships in the Pacific region as of April 20, 1949, and to compare them with figures from January 1, 1947. Navy Undersecretary Mr. Dugdale refused to provide the information, stating that its publication would be inconsistent with government policy. However, he told another Conservative MP that since October 1947, there have been no British aircraft carriers in the Pacific region.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States are Testing Automatically Controlled Rockets</h3>
<p>"Reuters, Nassau, Bahamas, 5th" A government spokesperson has confirmed reports from the United States that negotiations are underway between London and Washington to test automatically controlled rockets in the Bahamas. The spokesperson said that the rockets will be controlled by a radio station 120 miles away. The rockets will not be loaded with explosives but will only contain guidance detonators which can be used via radio to self-destruct the rocket if it veers off course.</p>
<h3>The Berlin Airlift Creates Special Merits; Clay Retires with Accomplishment and Deserves Praise; the US and UK Spend Vast Sums, 47 Pilots Die.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 4th] The American and British airlift to Berlin has achieved a great victory today, with the Soviet Union agreeing to lift the land blockade of Berlin, thus achieving the will of those determined. The airlift initially began as a small-scale contingency plan, but within ten months, it became a great feat. Twenty-five American pilots and twenty-two British pilots died while airlifting food and coal to Berlin. The United States spent a total of $150 million on transport, and Britain spent tens of millions of pounds.</p>
<p>Today, airlift planes are still operating as usual, and the pilots hardly pay attention to the New York negotiations to lift the blockade. Starting next week, these people can probably reduce their strange adventures and entrust most of the freight to railways and trucks, but the political effect of the airlift will last a long time. Some people believe that communism has been blocked at the Spree River (which runs through Berlin's urban area). The Soviet side never thought that the United States and Britain could supply a city solely by air, and the Soviet Union forced the United States and Britain to build and train what can be called the largest air force in peacetime history. Not only did the Soviet Union doubt the success of the airlift, but also some authorities in the United States and Britain did, but only one person believed from the beginning that it would succeed, namely General Clay, the commander of the US forces in Germany who initiated the airlift. Clay has retired with success tomorrow. The airlift began on a Sunday afternoon in June last year when the Soviet Union blockaded the land and water traffic in West Berlin and announced that it would no longer supply the citizens of West Berlin. Clay immediately summoned the air force stationed in Wiesbaden and summoned the chief of staff. Clay proposed airlifting food to Berlin. The chief of staff readily agreed to transport 60 tons, but Clay wanted to transport 500 tons, which made the chief of staff dumbfounded. At that time, there were only twin-engine light transport aircraft teams in Germany, but they still tried it resolutely. Hours later, battle-scarred C47 transport planes departed from the airport to Berlin, without stopping in the cold and heat, and continued to work hard until today.</p>
<h3>South Korea's Northern Part of Kaesong City is Suddenly Attacked by North Korean Troops</h3>
<p>The Army Department Announces It Has Repelled Them</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 5th] The South Korean Army Department announced on the 5th that two groups of North Korean troops carrying Japanese artillery and machine guns crossed the 38th parallel in the U.S. sector on the 4th and attacked the northern part of Kaesong City (transliteration), which is 50 miles northwest of Seoul, but were all repelled by the South Korean troops. It is said that the first batch of about 200 North Korean troops launched an attack from the Soviet-controlled area and were repelled by two battalions of South Korean troops. The second time, another 300 North Korean troops, later reinforced by 500 troops, attacked the same area and were also repelled. One South Korean soldier died and twelve were injured. The initial purpose of the North Korean troops' attack is unclear. It is generally believed that the possible purpose of the North Korean troops is to seize the mountain overlooking Kaesong City. The mountain is located on the 38th parallel separating North and South Korea. This war ended at 6:30 pm on the 4th, and the South Korean troops "completely controlled the situation."</p>
<h3>Negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia Are Approaching the End Stage</h3>
<p>Deeply Believed That There Are Still Hidden Reefs in the Future</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 4th] The informal negotiations between the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia, chaired by the United Nations, which are being conducted here, will reach the end stage this week. The chief representative of the Netherlands, Mr. Van Royen, and the chief representative of Indonesia, Mr. Rom, have been working hard for two weeks to reach an agreement on the following points: (1) the degree of sovereignty that the Republic of Indonesia can exercise; (2) the Netherlands' requirement that the Republic of Indonesia accept the armistice; (3) the date and conditions for convening a round table conference in The Hague. Mr. Nasir, one of the representatives of the Indonesian delegation, resigned from his position as a representative today. It is said that it is an expression of the division of opinions within the Indonesian delegation. Therefore, some people believe that there may still be hidden reefs in the future of the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations.</p>
<h3>US Military Supplies Allocated to the Netherlands Will Be Used to Deal with Indonesia</h3>
<p>The Indonesian Representative in the United States Mainly Prevents This</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 5th] The representative of the Republic of Indonesia in the United States, Mr. Sumitro, announced today that the military equipment allocated to the Netherlands under the North Atlantic Treaty can be used by the Netherlands to deal with Indonesia, just as it uses funds assisted by the Economic Cooperation Administration to carry out colonial wars. Although the use of American military supplies delivered to the Netherlands in the future can be strictly controlled, those already in the hands of the Dutch army will not be controlled, and the Dutch reinforcements recently sent to Indonesia are by no means unarmed. The US government had previously stated that the military supplies that the United States supplies to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries will only be used for their own national defense. If the Netherlands and France do so, they cannot use this to transfer it to Indonesia and Vietnam. If there is a violation of this condition, the United States has the right to stop lending military supplies. In order to strengthen this policy, the State Department is seriously considering adding a clause to the military supply contract, stipulating that American military supplies cannot be used to free up its own national military supplies and transfer them elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Belgian House of Representatives Approves the Convention</h3>
<p>[United Press, Brussels, 4th] The Belgian House of Representatives today approved the North Atlantic Treaty by a vote of 139 to 22. The treaty still needs to be approved by the Senate.</p>
<h3>Commonwealth Countries Agree to Provide Military Assistance to Myanmar; the Treaty of Friendship between India and Switzerland is Officially Exchanged</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] Officials said tonight that the United Kingdom and other countries of the British Commonwealth may soon provide Myanmar with military supplies and cash, which was decided at the recent Commonwealth Conference. Australia, India, Pakistan, New Zealand, etc. all agree to support Myanmar.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bern, 4th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Swiss Foreign Minister Petitpierre will exchange the instruments of ratification of the Treaty of Friendship between the two countries here on the 5th. The treaty contains nine articles and was signed in New Delhi on August 14 last year. It is the first treaty signed by India with a foreign country after its independence. After the exchange of documents, the treaty will take effect.</p>
<h3>Dulles Attends Senate Testimony and Supports the Atlantic Treaty, Emphasizing the Importance of Pacific Defense</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Republican figure Dulles said to the Senate Military Committee today that war is very possible if the United States does not ratify the North Atlantic Treaty. Mr. Dulles indirectly hinted that the defense of the Pacific is as important as the Atlantic. It is said that Stalin announced 25 years ago that the victory of the revolution depends on the revolution of colonies and dependent countries. Stalin specifically mentioned China and India, saying that this kind of statement is still the main part of the Soviet Communist Party's bible, and we should not forget it for a day.</p>
<h3>The French Trial of French Traitors Is Coming to an End</h3>
<p>Special Court Will Be Abolished Next Month</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The French handling of French traitors after the war has almost come to an end today. The National Assembly is already discussing a bill stipulating that all special courts established after the liberation to try French traitors will be abolished from June 1, and only the higher court specializing in the trial of former Vichy government cabinet members and senior officials will continue to be preserved. By 1948, the Higher Court had tried a total of 57 criminals, including 16 tried in absentia. Among them, 18 were sentenced to death, including 10 who were sentenced to death in absentia. Those executed were Vichy Prime Minister Laval, Secret Police Chief Darnand, Vichy Representative to the occupied areas Brinon. The death sentences of Marshal Petain and Navy Commander-in-Chief Laborde were commuted to life imprisonment. The death sentences of State Councilor Messing and Minister of Justice Tallace were commuted to life imprisonment. Vichy Commander in Syria, Denz, died in prison.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Take Action against Hungary and Paul for Violating the Treaty</h3>
<p>Acheson Indicates at a Reception for Reporters</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] Secretary of State Acheson issued a statement at the weekly reception for reporters today, revealing that the United States is about to take action regarding Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania's violation of the human rights clauses in the peace treaty. He revealed that after the sentencing of Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty and the expulsion of priests and opposition parties in Paul and other countries, the United States issued a statement of condemnation, which the three countries rejected.</p>
<h3>"I Chose Freedom" Will Be Brought to the Screen</h3>
<p>The Original Author Kravchenko Announces</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Kravchenko, the author of "I Chose Freedom," told reporters here today that he intends to put the content of the book on the screen as a crisp, sincere, and humane script without any propaganda effect. In other words, it is sympathetic to Russia and opposed to the Soviets. Mr. Kravchenko also said that he intends to adapt the book into a radio script. He still intends to complete another book and then return to his hometown. He particularly emphasized the point of returning to his country. Although it is unknown when this matter can be realized, his life has no meaning if it is not realized one day. Mr. Kravchenko solemnly denied that he is related to any right-wing or reactionary groups. He quite approves of the British socialist government. When talking about the Cold War between the East and the West, he believes that it is not optimistic, because the compromise on the Berlin issue is just pouring a drop of cold water on the burning flame, and there will be more amazing events in the future.</p>
<h3>Ingrid Bergman Decides to Divorce Her Husband</h3>
<p>The Two Could Not Help But Shed Tears When They Kissed Goodbye</p>
<p>[Reuters, Palermo, Sicily, 4th] Hollywood Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman and her husband, Dr. Lindström, could not help but shed tears when they kissed goodbye here today. Italian director Rossellini, who is known as Ingrid's new lover, and many photographers were present to witness this moving scene. Ingrid and the other three had a negotiation with a lawyer last night at the Royal Hotel in Messina, Sicily. This morning, Ingrid and her husband kissed goodbye in tears in front of the hotel. Lindström, the director of surgery at the Los Angeles Hospital, is a famous brain specialist. After learning that Ingrid intended to marry Rossellini, he rushed over from Los Angeles. After saying goodbye to her husband, Ingrid took a boat with Rossellini to the island of Stromboli to continue filming. Dr. Lin took a plane back to the United States. There are different rumors about the results of the negotiations in the hotel last night. Some say that Ingrid has reached a compromise with her husband, and others say that Ingrid and Lindström have decided to divorce. However, according to film industry sources here, Hollywood film tycoon Hughes, who is also the main investor in the film Ingrid is currently filming in Italy, has decided to stop sponsoring the film because he is dissatisfied with Ingrid's love affair with Rossellini. Film industry sources also pointed out that the film was originally sponsored by Hollywood film tycoon MGM boss Goldwyn, but Mr. Goldwyn decided to withdraw his sponsorship after meeting with Rossellini.</p>
<h3>The British Labour Party</h3>
<p>— By Brailsford, Translated by Song Guihuang</p>
<p>During the First World War, the Independent Labour Party attracted many liberals from the left wing because of its opposition to imperialism. Now that it had these new forces! Therefore, its appearance contained the tradition of liberalism, that is, humanitarianism, willingness to accept the opinions of the other party, especially in international or imperial disputes. Later, when the Liberal Party frequently disintegrated due to the divisions between Asquith and Lloyd George, the more progressive liberals flocked to the Labour Party. One of the results was that Henderson saw that the constitution of the Labour Party must be revised. Until 1918, middle-class members who wanted to join the Labour Party still needed to obtain the qualifications of members of the Independent Labour Party or the Fabians first. As a result, the Independent Labour Party was responsible for publicity and campaigning. But in this year, in each constituency, there was always a party branch coexisting with the trade union branch. Equally important was that both manual workers and brain workers could join the party without discrimination. Today, the political organization of the Labour Party has expanded its foundation from this, and it is fortunate that the Independent Labour Party withdrew from it by 1932.</p>
<p>National Organization</p>
<p>In these early formative periods, the Labour Party evolved from a small group whose original goal was to promote the special interests of manual workers, so as to unite them into a political party, hoping to participate in politics on a national scale. Today, most of the members and voters of the Labour Party are still manual workers, and most of its funds are collected from members. Every annual meeting can always call on the majority of members. But the whole situation is more than that. Political organizations and education work are entrusted to the party branches under the jurisdiction of the electoral districts, and the middle class is quite powerful in these party branches. These party branches lead a kind of traditional social life and service that the Independent Labour Party had in its early days. These are not available in other political parties. It contains the style of believers who oppose the state religion, and its Sunday evening meetings contain the atmosphere of religion and politics.</p>
<p>In the close comradeship of the Labour Party, class differences soon faded. A hundred years ago, Marx said that the proletariat had nothing to lose but their chains, but the proletariat had disappeared in the British Isles. Today, the proletariat are all dark-skinned, but you must go to Africa and India to find them. For six or seventy years, manual workers have relied on the assistance of Ruskin College to carry out self-education in order to bear their responsibilities. As a result, in the main objects of the labor movement in the past half century, the level of ability has gradually increased, occupying the first seat in Parliament. Although it is in the idealism of the next generation, there are many scientists, poets, technicians and doctors. Today, it speaks for half the people in the country.

The first quarter ended with a draw of 5 to 5. At the beginning of the second quarter, the competition was still fierce, creating equals. The Eagle team made a big mistake by replacing Huang Pinzhen with Lu Jinhua. The Li team took the opportunity to rise, and ended the first half with 17 to 13. After the break, the battle became a stalemate. When it was 20 to 25, the Eagle team Wang Canhua was dismissed for five fouls.

The first half ended, and the Green team took the lead with 17 to 9. After changing baskets, both sides changed their formations. The Ya team showed a tired look, and the Green team did whatever they wanted. In the third quarter, the Green team had 29 points and the Ya team had 10 points. In the last quarter, Ya team Zhu Jiazhen graduated from fouling. The Green team transferred Lu Huijun and Wu Meimou, and they could still control it with ease.

<p>In the last match of the men's elimination round, the Tung Wah team played against the Pu team, with referees Huang Cunrui and Liu Hesheng. After contact, Chen Xianglong scored first. Pu team Chen Wenzao and Tian Zhaoqi scored two points, and Zhou Dajun scored from a distance. They were all equal. Tung Wah Da Yun scored in succession and advanced with 10 to 7. The Pu team was unwilling to show weakness, and Zhao Guiquan and Huang Wencheng went hand in hand to create a tie of 12 points each. The Pu team worked hard and raised their heads with 23 to 17. When Xianglong held the ball in, the first half ended, and the Tung Wah team was at a disadvantage with 19 to 23.</p>
<p>After the break, the Tung Wah team replaced Chen Xianglong with Jia Youliang. The Pu team still led the way. Tung Wah team Li Yao transferred Youliang, once approaching with 27 to 31.

<h3>Table Tennis Group B Sees an Upset: Red and White Defeats Top-Seeded Ling Team</h3>
<p>Today Continues with Five Group B Matches</p>
<p>In the fourth session of the Table Tennis League, the other day, the Group A Hua Mei team was scheduled to play against the Group B Postal team, but the Postal team was unable to compete due to other uses of the postal service's table tennis room. Therefore, both sides agreed to reschedule. In another match, the Red and White team of the Group B division one faced the Ling team at the Guohuo Table Tennis Room. The Red and White team, comprised of students from St. John's University, had participated in four matches, with two wins and two losses, and had already lost hope of being selected. The Ling team was the top seed in their division, having won all five of their matches, boasting strong players. In this match, the Red and White players were determined to win at all costs, playing with exceptional effort. Although the Ling team took an early lead of two to one, unfortunately, in the fourth group, Jin Shisheng of the Ling team was defeated one to two by Dong Shaolong, the captain of the Red and White team, creating a tense situation. In the final decisive group match, Rong Wenbang, the main player of the Ling team, battled fiercely against Li Chuanqi, a strong player from the opposing team. Rong, lacking in practice, made many errant shots. Chuanqi fought tirelessly, ultimately winning in straight sets against Rong Wenbang. As a result, the Red and White team defeated the top-seeded Ling team three to two, a true masterpiece of an upset. The match results of the two teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Red and White)　　Score　　　(Ling Team)</p>
<p>Cai Senfu　　11—21　21—16　16—21　　Ji Rutang</p>
<p>Zhou Zhixing　　21—18　21—19　　Zhang Yuefu</p>

<p>Today (the 6th) continues with five Group B matches. The postal service's table tennis room has been relocated to the downstairs consumer cooperative near the entrance, where matches will continue as scheduled. The two teams scheduled for today's matches should take note. The organizers hope that the winning teams will promptly submit the score sheets to the League office the following day to facilitate progress. The schedule for today is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Kyushu Iwa Football Game Postponed, Today Central Art vs. Huaguang Clash</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Democratic Cup football match between Kyushu and Iwa was not held due to intermittent rain, although the field was not muddy. If the weather clears today, the match between Central Art and Huaguang will kick off at 4:30 PM at the Nanshi Stadium, with referee Ma Youyu and linesmen Ni Shiyao and Yan Yougeng. Central Art is the "local bully" of Nanshi, currently holding an undefeated record. They previously overwhelmed Samsung with a score of three to one and forced a draw of two to two with the leading team. Their remaining formidable opponents are only Kyushu and Huaguang, so they harbor ambitions of winning the cup. Today's match against Huaguang is of great significance. If Central Art can win, the only team capable of competing with them would be Kyushu. However, Huaguang is a seasoned and experienced team, with fast-moving forwards and a strong defense. Wu Qixiang's powerful kicks are particularly capable of suppressing attacks, so when they play well, they can make any strong team bow their heads. They are not easy to deal with. The outcome of this match holds great potential. (If the weather is abnormal, inquiries can be made by calling 〇2—7〇746)</p>

<h3>Industry and Commerce on the Brink of Collapse: Calls to Correct Public Utility Index, Committee to Discuss Suppression Measures Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The city's public utility pricing index has been soaring in recent days, and citizens are already overwhelmed by the burden. The City Council's Public Utilities Committee has scheduled a committee meeting for tomorrow (the 7th) at 3:00 PM at the City Council to discuss reasonable suppression measures. It is reported that some councilors believe that the continuous and drastic increase in the public utility index has directly and indirectly had the most serious and worst impact on citizens. They are determined to speak out righteously at tomorrow's meeting, plead for the seven million citizens, and firmly advocate for the abolition of the public utility index to relieve people's difficulties and stabilize social order. It is also rumored that three or four councilors who have relationships with various public utility agencies (employees of the Public Utilities Bureau and heads of water and electricity institutions) will recuse themselves at the time to prevent accusations from society.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the continuous surge in the public utility index threatened the livelihoods of seven million citizens in Shanghai, forcing large and small industrial and commercial businesses to the brink of collapse and affecting social stability, leaders from all walks of life have attached great importance to the matter. Jian Guansan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, also deeply felt that the daily increase in the public utility index was indeed unbearable for all citizens, and factories in particular felt unable to cope. Production was far less than before, and transportation and locking became increasingly difficult. The state of exhaustion was increasing day by day. If this continued, the consequences would be unimaginable. He believed that this issue was extremely serious, so he specially sent a letter to the mayor, instructing various public utility units to promptly discuss and improve measures to reduce the burden on the people and the industrial community, so as to maintain production and promote stability.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, major flour factories, and the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association have all made urgent appeals on this issue. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and employees of the British Waterworks have also sent letters providing explanations.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command, the Songhu Garrison Command, and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting prompt and effective measures to suppress the index. The telegram stated: "According to a telegram from the Municipal Hotel and Commerce Association, the public utility pricing index is leaping wildly day by day. Our member stores are unable to cope even with their total operating income. The electricity bill alone has exceeded the total income by several times, causing extreme distress (the situation in each store can be verified by sending personnel for inspection). If the water and electricity companies cut off water and power due to unpaid fees, they should be responsible for all resulting problems. We hereby request that this be forwarded to the military and political authorities for review, with utmost urgency and gratitude." The telegram further stated that the public utility industry's self-created "pricing index" and daily price increases were unprecedented in any city and a violation of fairness.</p>
<p>Monthly electricity bills often reach billions. Taking the hotel industry as an example, the Yangzi Hotel's total operating income for the entire last month was only 1.7 billion yuan, while the electricity bill for last month, calculated at 790,000 times the base rate, reached 4.2 billion yuan. In industry, the Yongfeng Yiji Dyeing and Weaving Factory's electricity bill for last month, calculated at 790,000 times the base rate, reached a staggering 4.6 billion yuan. The same is true for water and telephone bills. If this frenzy is not curbed, the city's industry and commerce will be forced to go bankrupt to pay for public utilities. There will be no money for public donations, taxes, or worker salaries. This alone is enough to bring this city to the brink of collapse. This is a disaster that strips the skin and should not be ignored. We urge you to investigate and take fair and effective measures to suppress the index, and not allow it to exhaust resources and sacrifice the city's industry and commerce. The matter is extremely urgent and awaiting your command.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Petitions Authorities to Stop Public Utility Index Increase</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The public utility companies in this city are announcing daily increases in the public utility index, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has petitioned the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council to promptly stop this practice. The original petition is recorded below: "It has been observed that the prices of daily necessities have recently tended to stabilize. The index published at the beginning of this month has not had a stimulating effect. The local authorities are working to study wage calculation standards to ensure that both labor and management can be maintained. However, the public utility enterprises announced a pricing index of 950,000 times on the 5th, while the wages earned by hundreds of thousands of workers in the city are only 370,000 times the base rate. Compared to the index, this is exceeded by two-thirds. Public utilities, as the name suggests, are related to the public life of society and are different from general for-profit enterprises. How can there be such a unique index that clearly deprives the public of its livelihood? Furthermore, the salaries of all foreign and some senior Chinese employees of electricity, lighting, telephone, and water companies are calculated in US dollars, and their generous treatment within China exceeds that of wealthy officials. Recently, the prices of all goods have generally fallen, but the prices of public utilities have risen. If effective measures are not taken immediately to stop this, the public in the city will be unable to live, and social order will be difficult to maintain. Furthermore, industry and commerce will be forced to close down sooner rather than later. It is recalled that public utilities previously wanted to price in Customs Gold Units, but this was stopped by the Municipal Council, and public anger subsided. Now, they are creating new names and leaving behind endless harm. We are compelled to urgently submit this document, pleading that you promptly stop this for the benefit of the public."</p>
<p>Water Company Employees Are Also Deeply Affected by the Soaring Prices</p>
<p>A letter from a group of employees of the British Shanghai Waterworks stated: "The base salaries of public utility employees are generally low. Last month, each person received only 6 million yuan in wages, and the company does not offer preferential treatment for water used by employees. Therefore, employees are also deeply affected by the soaring water prices. Calculating the salary index at 370,000 times the base rate, the employees' salaries should be more than 20 million yuan, while the water bill must be at least more than 10 million yuan." Since worker wages are low and company expenses are reduced, there is no reason for the public utility index to rise daily. Even employees of the Waterworks are affected by high water bills, so the suffering of the general public can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Wang Weiheng Takes Over as Head of Finance Bureau: Handover Ceremony Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Qian Jianfu, the acting director of the Finance Bureau, has been transferred to the position of Deputy General Manager of the Bank of Shanghai. The position of director has been filled by Major General Wang Weiheng, appointed by the Municipal Government. The handover ceremony between the new and outgoing directors was held in the bureau's conference room at 10:30 AM yesterday, with the participation of over 100 heads and staff members of various departments. The ceremony was simple and solemn, and concluded at 11:20 AM.</p>
<h3>Tao Yishan Arrives Yesterday, Chen Baotai Takes Office Next Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The new Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, Tao Yishan, officially arrived at the bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday to assume his duties. The new Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chen Baotai, is scheduled to officially take office next Monday.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The new Director of the Education Bureau, Zhao Jialin, is scheduled to arrive at the Municipal Education Bureau today to handle the handover.</p>
<h3>Banks and Financial Institutions Have Overnight Funds: Central Bank Fully Allocates Cash</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] As of yesterday, all banks, financial institutions, and trust companies in this city have stopped issuing banker's drafts. Banker's drafts that have already been issued will be collected as much as possible. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of banks and financial institutions for turnover funds, the Central Bank began yesterday to fully allocate cash according to the amount of each bank and financial institution's overnight deposits in the National Bank. This is divided into 30% in silver dollars (priced at 4 million yuan each), 35% in cash, and 35% in National Bank fixed-amount banker's drafts. Therefore, as of yesterday, each bank and financial institution has been able to fully meet the needs of customers for cash withdrawals.</p>
<p>Certified Checks Continue to Be Issued</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a person in charge of the Bankers Association who spoke to our reporter: Since the issuance of banker's drafts by banks and financial institutions was suspended yesterday, the situation regarding meeting customer needs has been quite good because the National Bank has been able to fully allocate cash. As for interbank certified checks, which are commonly used between financial institutions, because they are only used for turnover within the industry and are fundamentally different in nature from banker's drafts, they will still be issued as usual when needed between financial institutions.</p>
<h3>April's Three-Union Rice Ration Extended to the 10th</h3>
<p>According to the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee: The rice ration for the third union in April has been delayed due to excessive freight costs, which could not be raised in time. The original deadline was extended to the 5th. Because a portion of the rationed rice has not yet been shipped out of the warehouse, the deadline has been extended again to the 10th of this month to accommodate a portion of citizens who have not yet purchased their rationed rice. Furthermore, the committee has largely raised enough rice for the May ration. The first phase of the May ration will begin after the third phase of the April ration is completed.</p>
<h3>Weekly Export Exchange Settlement Amount Less Than Two Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] It has been learned that the total amount of export exchange settlement in Shanghai for the entire last month was US$7,715,335.16, which is much lower than in March. The average weekly export figure is less than US$2 million.</p>
<h3>Robber Murders, Three Criminals Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Following the execution of Tong Bofu, the main culprit in a plot to commit illegal acts, the police station yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM also executed three robbery-murderers by firing squad at the North Datong Road: Yan Jinxiang (28 years old, from Yancheng), Xia Yifei (27 years old, from Yancheng), and Luo Wenxiang (24 years old, from Yancheng). It was found that Yan and Luo colluded to rob the home of Li Hu on the 8th of last month at No. 90 Puqingfang, Datong Road. They opened fire when resisting arrest, and Wang Jie, a patrol officer from the Zhabei Branch Police Station who led the police to encircle and arrest them, was shot and killed. Afterwards, the police station sent personnel to pursue the case and arrested 24 people, including Yan Jinxiang. After separate interrogations, it was learned that Yan and Luo Wenxiang were the culprits who shot and killed the five patrol officers who resisted arrest at the time. Xia Yifei was a major criminal who opened fire and killed the victim, Tan Shifa, during a robbery on October 8th of last year at No. 822 Datong Road. The police station believes that during this period of martial law, they cannot tolerate such people who disregard the law and act recklessly. In addition to sending the 21 suspects, including Wu Jinru, to the court for trial in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Bandits, the police station specially sentenced the three leading criminals, Yan, Luo, and Xia, to the most severe punishment for robbery and murder. After being presented to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for approval by the police station, they were tied up and taken to the scene for execution by firing squad to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Illegal Group Cracked Down in Lotus Temple, Main Culprit Tong Bofu Executed by Firing Squad, Over 100 Accomplices to Be Treated Leniently</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] On the 26th of last month, the Police Headquarters, based on a report from Feng Wenxiao, the chief of the Huangpu Police Branch, cracked down on an illegal secret group posing as the so-called "Presidential Office First Social Supervision Group" at the Lotus Temple on Chengdu South Road. The police arrested the main culprit, Tong Bofu, and over 100 accomplices, including Liu Yukun, and seized 21 long and short firearms and various forged seals and documents. After investigation, the criminals confessed without denying. The case was presented to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for approval, and Tong was sentenced to the most severe punishment in accordance with Articles 2 and 7 of the Shanghai Emergency Security Regulations. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Tong was taken to the front of the Lotus Temple for execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>Over 100 Accomplices Were Mostly Deceived</p>
<p>The 100 accomplices, including Liu Yukun, were mostly ignorant youths who were deceived into joining the group, which is excusable. It is said that Director Mao will treat them leniently. According to the main culprit, Tong Bofu, 38 years old, from Hunan, after establishing an illegal group under the name of the "Presidential Office First Social Supervision Group," many ignorant people joined the group. One reason was that the organization's name of the Presidential Office was quite appealing. Another reason was that the so-called "investigation certificate" issued by the organization listed absurd terms such as holding the certificate entitles the holder to free rides on state-run planes and various vehicles and ships, and the holder is allowed to enter entertainment venues, martial law areas, and fortress areas.</p>
<p>The Real Purpose is to Gather Wealth and Plot Rebellion</p>
<p>However, the real purpose was to collect wealth and plot to support the Communist bandits when they attacked Shanghai. In addition, the organization dared to openly send documents to the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the Police Bureau requesting the supply of investigation materials. After receiving this information, Feng Wenxiao, the chief of the Huangpu Police Branch, immediately secretly reported to Director Mao because the name of the group had never been heard before. After inquiring with the Presidential Office and confirming that there was no such organization, the Criminal Division sent Section Chief Yao of the Fifth Section to be responsible for the investigation and sent personnel to secretly join the organization as members. On April 26th, after learning that the organization was holding a secret meeting at the Lotus Temple, the police sent a large number of officers to rush to the scene and arrest all the main culprits and accomplices in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Temporarily Closed</h3>
<p>The Stock Exchange temporarily closed yesterday. According to authorities at the exchange, the temporary closure will not be long. It is expected that it will resume in a week or so, so that the market prices of various stocks can be renegotiated and revised to match the market situation.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Sales Dull, 16-Count Coarse Yarn Uniquely Popular</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was stable yesterday, and the prices of various yarns saw slight increases, but actual sales were sluggish. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was the same as the closing price yesterday afternoon, with no change. Jincheng yarn was 740 million, a slight increase of 20 million. 40-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 720 million, an increase of 100 million yuan. The prices of 32-count yarns from various mills saw slight increases of 10 million. 21-count Double Horse warehouse-made yarn was 470 million, and spot goods were 510 million, both up 30 million. 20-count yarn increased by 20 to 30 million. 16-count yarn was uniquely popular, with sales more active than other yarns, increasing by 20 million. The prices of 10-count yarns from various mills all increased.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Lingers</p>
<p>Due to news of the opening of southbound transport, the cotton cloth market was slightly stimulated, and the market lingered steadily. There was little trading of Four Gentlemen serge outside the market, and the trading of fine cloth was quite lively. The foothold of low-end fine cloth was particularly firm. Due to the suspension of interbank lending, the trading of shipping out goods to realize funds and shipping out funds to purchase goods disappeared, so large-scale transactions were extremely rare.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Trend Firm and Upward</h3>
<p>The rice market trend turned firm, and arrivals were visibly reduced. There were not many samples for sale, and rice shops continued to increase their stocks. The market trend was firm and upward, and prices increased. White japonica rice at the South Market was 22 million, and thin rice was 22.8 million yuan, each up 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan compared to the previous day. Early rice increased by more than 10%, trading at 22 million yuan. Indica rice was relatively lower, with milled indica at 19 million yuan. White japonica rice at the North Rice Market was 22 million, up 10%, but there were not many transactions.</p>
<p>Edible oil prices rose. Absorption continued on this street, and sales were very smooth. Soybean oil reached a high of 100 million yuan, and the closing price was 92 million, an increase of 6 million yuan. Rapeseed oil reached a high of 84 million, and the closing price was 76 million, a strong increase of 8 million yuan. A cask of rapeseed oil was 84 million, also up 8 million yuan. A small cart of sesame oil was 72 million yuan. Soybean cake has not yet opened.</p>
<p>The flour market trend turned firm as prices for all goods outside the ring generally increased, and sentiment turned firm. Retailers were absorbing strongly, and prices generally jumped by 20%. The opening price for old trucks was 5.4 million, and the supply in the central market was extremely scarce, and there were very few transactions. The market opened at a high price of 5.8 million in the afternoon. Battleship flour was 5.2 million, Red Bee flour was 4.8 million. Bran was also expensive, with Fufeng large bags at 4.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Grains rose across the board. Winter beans and spring beans were both trading at 15 million, up about 20% compared to the previous day. Mulberry garden beans were selling extremely well, and the market rose to 16 million yuan yesterday. Broad beans rose again by 20%, with Xieqiao selected green beans at 37.5 million. Peanut kernels also saw strong increases. Sesame seeds, corn, and sorghum all rose in unison.</p>
<p>Tea Market Slightly Soft</p>
<p>Since buyers all adopted a wait-and-see attitude, transactions were rare, and the trend has long been in a state of stillness. Yesterday's market was even more desolate due to continuous rain. However, inquiries with sellers revealed that prices remained unchanged, although the foothold was slightly softening.</p>
<h3>Gold Hovering at Low Levels</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The gold market situation remained sluggish yesterday, hovering at low levels. Because banks and financial institutions can no longer issue banker's drafts, transactions have invisibly become cash and fixed-amount banker's drafts. Therefore, the actual price has changed from the banker's draft price to the cash price. All parties are wary of the Garrison Headquarters' emergency regulations. Some firms have temporarily suspended trading and switched to gold and silver exchange business.</p>
<p>In the morning, spot goods outside the market were sold off by general banks and financial institutions to make up for the shortage of banker's drafts. Manufacturers also released large quantities of physical goods to pay electricity bills and daily expenses. With both forces acting together, the supply was abundant and there were few buyers.</p>
<p>The opening price was 170 million and 200 million, but then fell to 160 million and 190 million, and the smallest price was 150 million and 180 million. The afternoon closing price returned to 170 million and 200 million.</p>
<p>The afternoon was slightly firmer, rising to 190 million and 220 million, and finally falling again to 180 million and 210 million, a further drop of 10 million compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The exchange rate of US dollars outside the market followed suit. The morning opening price was 3.5 million and 4 million, and it fell to 3 million and 3.5 million. The afternoon closing price remained at 3.5 million and 4 million. It was said to have risen in the afternoon, with an initial price of 3.8 million and 4.3 million, but finally fell again to 3.7 million and 4.2 million, a further drop of 100,000.</p>
<p>Another report: The ratio of US dollars to gold yesterday was 48 and 51, and the ratio to silver dollars was 6.8 and 7.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday's gold jewelry in silver shops remained suspended. Most silver shops were closed all day and were not seen to open.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday's gold and silver exchange market in office buildings saw prices of 34 and 37 in the morning, falling to 33 and 35. The afternoon closing price was 35 and 37. The afternoon was slightly lower to 34.5 and 36.5 yuan. Transactions of factory bars were rare. The morning price was 37 and 39, and the afternoon was slightly lower to 36 and 38. Transactions were quite active.</p>

<h3>Public Utility Index Drops by 880,000 Times</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, the public utility pricing index for May 6th was 880,000 times the base rate. After continuous sharp increases in recent days, it finally decreased slightly yesterday. It is unknown whether this is the result of unanimous criticism and attacks from society.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Change Salary Calculation Methods, Cost of Living Index No Longer Published, Three Principles of Salary Payment Confirmed, to be Implemented Next Week After Decision</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] In recent months, prices have risen significantly. The cost of living index salary calculation method is no longer sufficient to maintain the livelihood of employees. The authorities are currently discussing with relevant parties how to improve the salary calculation method. As a result of the exchange of opinions, three principles have now been determined: (1) the cost of living index will be discontinued; (2) future salary calculation methods must maintain the minimum living standards of workers; (3) salary payments will utilize various means, such as rice, gold yuan notes, silver dollars, and other valuables. This method will be finalized within days and implemented next week. The cost of living index for this month will no longer be published.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] In these extraordinary times, the current practice of using the cost of living index to calculate the salaries of employees in this city is no longer in line with practical needs. The authorities are paying close attention to this issue. After days of research by various parties, a new decision will be made regarding salary payment methods in this city. It is reported that this new method will be implemented as soon as the final decision is made. The details of the method are as follows: (1) the cost of living index salary calculation method will not be adopted; (2) the minimum salary shall not be lower than four dou of rice; (3) the base salary will be converted to silver dollars, but the discount will be extremely low, approximately between 10% and 20%.</p>

<h3>Culprit of the Huge Fire in Western Shanghai Captured, 20,000 Refugees Have Obtained Shelter, Various Circles Send Cakes and Porridge</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A large fire occurred near Zhongshan Park on Changning Road in western Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. The disaster area is approximately 200,000 square meters, and the number of victims reached more than 20,000. The volunteer police of the Old Zha District sent more than 300 catties of large cakes and steamed buns the night before yesterday. The Jing'an District Office sent more than 50 catties of large cakes and steamed buns. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association drove porridge carts to the disaster area to distribute more than three dan of porridge to relieve the fire refugees. More than 20,000 refugees were housed in five or six schools and major factories. The arsonist, a woman named Gao Bian, 28 years old, from northern Jiangsu, was captured by the French Concession police station. According to her confession, the fire was caused by carelessness when cooking at 2 p.m. on the 4th. A spark fell into a pile of straw. Because the surrounding area was full of shantytowns and the wind was strong, the fire became uncontrollable. At 4 p.m. yesterday, the French Concession District Office invited local gentry and relevant groups to meet at the Huierkang Tea Room opposite Zhongshan Park to discuss relief and aftermath arrangements for the refugees, hoping that the local gentry and charitable organizations could provide relief so that more than 20,000 refugees would not be displaced.</p>
<h3>To Facilitate Population Evacuation, the Garrison Headquarters Decided on Six Items</h3>

<h3>Suggestions to Organize Cooperatives to Take Over Public Utilities, Wang Xiaolai Pleads for Manufacturers and Citizens</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The price index for public utilities such as water and electricity has risen wildly in recent days, and manufacturers and small citizens alike feel overwhelmed. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Chinese National Manufacturers Association, in view of this, specially suggested organizing cooperatives to take over and operate them reasonably, so as to seek happiness for the people. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Industrial Association: It is an irrefutable principle that local public utilities, especially water, electricity, and telephone services, should be run by the city. Even if we take a step back, water, electricity, and telephone services should at least be operated by cooperatives organized by users, so that individual economies can become collective economies. Because public utilities are monopolistic undertakings, they should seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. If private individuals are allowed to operate them, they will inevitably aim at making profits and will not be able to seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. For example, water, electricity, and telephone services are like using needles to pierce people for blood transfusions, so that people can meet the needs of their lives, and at the same time perform blood-drawing operations, so that people gradually become thin and even die. When Shanghai is in a period of developed production and economic prosperity, although this kind of blood that is drawn out has more benefits than the blood that is put in, the losses are compensated by gains in other areas, so people are not aware of the magnitude of the damage. But now Shanghai's production is almost stagnant, the economy is on the verge of exhaustion, and the cost of public utilities, especially the cost of water, electricity, and telephone services, is still the same as in the days of previous development and prosperity, and it gives and asks for whatever it wants, so it is appropriate that users are unable to afford it. The situation recorded in the newspapers on May 5 is only the tip of the iceberg. Of course, the index of public utility costs is independent and growing day by day, which is one of the reasons, but the most fundamental reason is that private monopoly makes it impossible to save money and impossible to replace. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to take back the city's operations. As a last resort, users should immediately unite to organize cooperatives to take over, so as to achieve the goal of "I am for everyone and everyone is for me," so that they can seek the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Therefore, I respectfully send this telegram to you, please understand and proceed, and the citizens of Shanghai will be deeply grateful. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chinese National Manufacturers Association."</p>

<h3>Flood Prevention and Afforestation in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>— Huang Huang</p>
<p>[Guangzhou, 28th] Guangdong Province suffers from severe floods, and the flooded area is vast. Those who talk about flood prevention mostly focus on building embankments. Because embankment construction is simple and its effects are easily seen, people are eager for quick success and instant benefits, abandoning dredging and tending towards embankment construction. However, it is not known that while embankment construction is important, the emphasis on building embankments and the neglect of dredging often lead to shallower riverbeds due to accumulated sediment, which inevitably affects higher river water levels. If the water level is raised, the embankment must be correspondingly higher to prevent flooding. If the embankment is higher, and there is still accumulated sediment and no dredging, it will inevitably cause the riverbed to become shallower. This cycle continues year after year, often leading to the riverbed being higher than the embankment. If there are torrential floods or the embankment foundation is slightly weak, it will easily collapse. Then the people and livestock within the embankment will all become fish and turtles, and it will be unstoppable. Furthermore, there are many embankments on both sides of the river, more than a thousand. The embankment foundations must be of varying strength and height. Those with solid foundations, strong foundations, and high foundations can fortunately escape the disaster. At this time, the water势 (the force of the water) will inevitably tend towards those with weak foundations and low foundations and destroy them, forcing each embankment to compete to strengthen its foundation and repair its embankment to protect itself. This consumes wealth and effort, and the people cannot live in peace, but still panic all day long, fearing the water. Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously dredge the river channels in a planned manner, clean up the sediment, so that the water flows smoothly, the floods lose their power, and then add embankments to confine them, then the flood prevention problem in Guangdong will be easily solved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the rivers in Guangdong Province have upstream areas that are mostly high mountains and ridges, and downstream areas that are all open plains, and there is a lack of lakes and marshes to regulate the river water. Therefore, if there is a mountain flood, it will rush thousands of miles, causing floods. Therefore, the flood prevention strategy in Guangdong Province, in addition to the above-mentioned dredging of river channels and the construction of embankments in the downstream areas, should pay attention to building more sluice gates and dams, repairing ponds and building lakes in the upper and middle reaches to regulate floods and contain water, so as to reduce the power of floods and reduce the occurrence of water disasters.</p>
<p>Afforestation is one of the fundamental methods of flood prevention. However, the benefits of forests for flood prevention are not seen overnight, and are often ignored by the people. The rulers have even less intention of addressing it. Although far-sighted politicians know the importance of forests and strongly advocate it, China has even designated a Tree Planting Day. However, the rulers who came after rarely sincerely implemented it, but merely敷衍 story, held it as a routine event, and did not engage in practical afforestation. May I ask how much has been planted in the space after designating Tree Planting Day for several decades and planting trees every year? Not only is the number of trees planted pitifully small, but there is also no tending or protection after planting. The survivors are only like those who have survived in a desperate situation. Even if they are fortunate enough to survive, they have already suffered from the cutting of firewood and from the destruction of the army before they have grown into timber. Therefore, trees are planted every year, but no forests are formed. If you look at the public forest farms throughout the province, which one is not disordered in its forest appearance and withering in its trees? This is sufficient proof. Even if there are some private forest farms of the people that have become forests, they are only purely economic forests, with very few flood prevention forests. That is, they all start from the economic point of view to create forests, and very few start from the flood prevention point of view to create forests. Although afforestation is a good thing, regardless of which starting point is used, it is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and it is beneficial to flood prevention and drought resistance. But it is not as good as focusing on flood prevention forests, so that it can not only obtain the benefits of timber, but also receive the function of regulating water and drought, and also have the effect of flood prevention. It is really a good remedy for the frequent floods in this province. Therefore, there is a special chapter in the theory of ordinary afforestation, so it will not be discussed. Now only discuss flood prevention afforestation as left:</p>
<p>Afforestation of Riverbanks</p>
<p>Afforestation of riverbanks is closely related to flood prevention. The effect of riverbank forests is great. The prominent ones are: (1) Conserving water resources, stopping sand flow, and reducing siltation in the riverbed. (2) Regulating drought and flood, increasing the production of crops. (3) Increasing the riverbank cover, preserving the soil and water, avoiding riverbank collapse and damaging the farmland along the bank. (4) Regulating the river water flow, preventing the river water from overflowing and drying up, and avoiding affecting all water conservancy. (5) Clarifying the river water, curbing the phenomenon of mountain floods and avoiding flood disasters. (6) Harmonizing the climate and increasing the scenery of the embankment, etc. The other direct and indirect benefits are too numerous to mention. Some say that although the benefits of afforestation of riverbanks are universal, and Guangdong often has typhoons that may shake the dike forest and harm the dike foundation. It is not seen its benefits, but its harms are seen. However, it is not known that if the afforestation of riverbanks is planted sporadically, the wind is strong and the forest is small, or there may be this disadvantage. If the entire riverbank is afforested, so that the dike forest is deeply rooted and intertwined, the wind force is great, and there is no damage. However, the most important thing to pay attention to is the problem of tree species in the dike forest. It is appropriate to choose those with tough trunks, small leaves, dense roots, and wind and humidity resistance. Therefore, if the afforestation of riverbanks can carefully select tree species and plant them universally, there are really a hundred benefits and not a single harm. In the Soviet Union, in the Volga River, Don River, Niba River, and Ural River basins, forests are planted and logging is forbidden along the banks of the river. This is sufficient proof. On the other hand, in the river basins of this province, the mountains surround both banks, most of which are bare mountains. On the banks of each river, landslides are seen everywhere, and mountain soil and sand flow and silt up the riverbed. This is why the flood is coming. Therefore, in the future, we should advocate afforestation of riverbanks and plan to set up nurseries in all Jiangyan banks, and universally afforest all mountains and fields within one mile on both sides of the upper and middle reaches and the base areas of the lower reaches to benefit flood prevention.</p>
<p>Afforestation of Water Sources: It is found that the water sources of the main tributaries of each river in this province, except for the Xijiang River, are all within the territory of this province, and the upper reaches of each river mostly belong to high mountains and ridges, with vast areas and large rainfall. However, there are no forests to contain and slow down the rain. The so-called "Nanyong sprinkles wet stones, Qujiang is three feet high, Qingyuan passes the roof ridge" in the folk songs is enough to fully express the phenomenon of my containment of water sources. According to the facts, heavy rain in the upper reaches of the Beijiang River arrives in Qujiang in one day, Yingde Lianjiangkou in another day, and Qingyuan in two days. It can be seen that the folk songs are not completely false, and it is also enough to prove the importance of afforestation of water sources. Therefore, if Guangdong wants to fundamentally prevent and prevent floods, it must carry out afforestation of water sources in the water sources of the main tributaries of each river. The original natural forests in each water source must be managed, closed to mountains, strictly prohibited from logging, and protected against burning mountains, so that they can become the "invisible reservoirs" of each water source, to prevent drought and flood, which is the basic plan for flood prevention in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Sand Prevention Afforestation: In addition to the above-mentioned riverbank afforestation and water source afforestation, flood prevention afforestation in Guangdong must also pay attention to "sand prevention afforestation" in order to be complete. The so-called sand prevention afforestation refers to dividing an area within ten miles of the river bank of each main tributary of each river into a "sand prevention zone". All hills and barren mountains in the "sand prevention zone" must be completely afforested. It is intended to make the rainwater on the land along the banks of the river must be clarified and deposited by the forest before flowing into the river, thereby avoiding mountain soil, sand flow, siltation, and facilitating river water flow and preventing floods.</p>
<p>Guangdong is the only subtropical region in China, with deep soil, abundant people and abundant resources. It is a pity that floods are frequent, which is the biggest shortcoming of the natural environment in this province. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent floods. The best way to prevent disasters is to pay equal attention to flood prevention and afforestation, treat both the symptoms and the root causes, and use them for each other, hoping to eliminate floods invisibly. I remember when I visited Taiwan last year, I felt that the climate and soil quality in Taiwan were very bad, and the rainfall was out of balance, and the wind disasters were severe. Compared with Guangdong, Guangdong can be said to be uniquely endowed by nature. It can make up for the deficiencies of nature by artificial means, build water conservancy, nurture forests, increase production, and improve agriculture, so that it has the name of Taiwan Treasure Island today. Now, with the superiority of the natural environment endowed by Guangdong and the addition of construction, can't it become a perfect Southern Paradise?</p>

<h3>The Lingfu Ship in Guangzhou, the Engine Has Not Been Oiled for a Long Time, the Shells Are Rusty</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou, 30th] Since March 27th, the Lingfu warship suddenly received an order from the Navy Headquarters to sail from Shanghai to the White Swan Lake in Guangzhou and anchor. Her whereabouts have puzzled people here. The Yangtze River defense is so tense now, why would a warship like the Lingfu leave its post? The reporter visited the ship on the morning of the 31st, and was received by Deng Tianjie, the captain of the ship, and He Shuduo, the vice-captain. When the reporter boarded the ship, he saw the soldiers on the ship scattered and scattered, lying on the side of the railing, looking at the sea, with a rather depressed attitude. According to the captain and vice-captain, the Lingfu was returned to China together with the Yinghe and Chongqing ships last year. The current captain of the Lingfu was the one who drove the Lingzhu warship at that time. They all felt a sense of depression that was difficult to vent about the uprising of the Chongqing ship. They said: We and the officers and soldiers of the Chongqing ship received training together in the United Kingdom. We have a good personal relationship. After returning to China, we were stationed in the Yangtze River, and the Chongqing ship was stationed in the north. After a few months of separation, we only knew after they left. As for why they left? What happened after they left? I think this is what the community must care about, but since the Chongqing ship left, we have been afraid to say anything even if we have feelings. We can only say: Such a result of the Chongqing ship: dying under its own artillery fire is a pity. The captain also said: Before coming to Guangzhou, we were originally in the Yangtze River to take charge of the defense. After the Chongqing ship left, we were transferred to Shanghai, and then to Guangzhou. Our current task is to train the navy in the South China region. They don't know when they will leave. There are currently about 200 officers and soldiers on the ship, more than 90% of whom are old soldiers who originally received training in the United Kingdom. Only 20 new recruits were sent to the ship for training. Most of the officers and soldiers on the ship are from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Hubei, and fewer are from Fujian and Guangdong. The captain is from Fujian, and the vice-captain is from Zhejiang. Regarding the treatment of officers and soldiers on the ship, the captain said: It is similar to that of ordinary troops, and it is always impossible to maintain the current actual life. The vice-captain also lamented that the prices in Guangzhou are too expensive.</p>
<p>The reporter visited the ship once and saw that many of the ship's machines had not been oiled for a long time, and some rust could be seen on them. In particular, the shells of the four main guns at the bow and stern of the ship also had some rust on their warheads.</p>
<h3>Shantou Situation: Human Meat Cheaper Than Pork</h3>
<p>[Shantou, 28th dispatch] Mid-level civil servants in Shantou currently receive monthly salaries of only a little over one thousand yuan. A month of hard work translates to only ten "shi jin" (approximately 5 kg) of rice. They are truly "serving the public on empty stomachs." Some employees of the National Tax Collection Bureau, due to excessively meager salaries, have been on strike since the 14th.</p>
<p>While all industries are in decline, the business of tobacco and liquor stores is uniquely prosperous. Sales of foreign cigarettes and liquor are very brisk. Fifty of the "Golfer" brand, or similar Navy brand cigarettes sell for 1,300 yuan, and there is no shortage of smokers. For low-level civil servants who need to socialize, a month's salary is just enough to buy a pack of cigarettes.</p>
<p>Barbershop prices have been repeatedly changed. From the end of the lunar year until now, they have risen from 50, 100, 150, 200, to 500 yuan. Many people, because of the sudden and drastic price increases, do not carry enough cash, leading to great embarrassment on the spot. Although the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Department has repeatedly issued "reprimands," the industry consistently disregards the laws, causing the general public to be troubled by their "three thousand green silk strands" (their hair).</p>
<p>Following the 10th and 11th, the market saw further chaos on the 16th. The Hong Kong dollar rose to a peak of 440 yuan in the evening. The "bull" markets on Yongping Road, Yongtai Road, and in front of the Small Park were particularly lively.</p>
<p>Shantou has four cinemas. Currently, the highest ticket price is 140 yuan. Due to the recent surge in population, each cinema is packed for every show. While there are certainly many with "gun-class" (power and influence) watching movies without paying, the situation is not as serious as in Shanghai and Guangzhou. This may be because there are relatively fewer soldiers and wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Since large numbers of upper-class refugees from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places have arrived, the simple and honest customs of Shantou have been gradually changing to extravagance under the influence of the "Shanghai style." Shops or stalls selling foreign goods smuggled from Hong Kong are springing up like bamboo shoots after the rain. "Red men" in suits and leather shoes, and "green women" wearing nylon stockings and leather coats, are becoming increasingly common.</p>
<p>Although Shantou does not have public dance halls, the Friendship Association and the Customs Club hold dances every weekend. The wealthy families also often have "parties," filled with the scent of clothes and hair, the sound of drunken songs and embraces, overflowing with an atmosphere of revelry on the eve of destruction.</p>
<p>Along with rising prices and the difficulty of life, the number of prostitutes has also increased dramatically. At night, Zhongshan Park is filled with "flying orioles" (prostitutes), soliciting customers. The price for a night of pleasure is very low. The price of human flesh in Shantou is even lower than that of pork.</p>
<p>The sales of Hong Kong newspapers in Shantou total more than 5,000 copies. Recently, because shipping to Shantou is earlier, the price is no more expensive than Shantou newspapers, so the number of subscribers is increasing daily, and the sales of Shantou newspapers are declining day by day.</p>
<h3>Female Soldiers in Taiwan's New Army</h3>
<p>[Taipei, 28th dispatch] In front of a banana grove in the northwest corner of Pingtung City, two rows of newly built gray brick barracks have been erected. This place used to be the residence of the Japanese Air Force officers, which was destroyed by American aircraft during the war. Now, the Army Training Command has hired workers to repair it, and in the midst of a desolate pile of broken bricks and tiles, two rows of simple barracks have been rebuilt.</p>
<p>Inside the barracks, a hundred or so modern girls arrived a few days ago. They are female intellectuals newly recruited by the Army Training Command from Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places. Most of them are middle school students, and a few have even received a university education. Leaving their homes and families, they have traveled from their distant hometowns, crossing the sea to the southern part of this subtropical island, to receive special training and prepare to shoulder a new mission for the country.</p>
<p>This group of girls took a boat from Shanghai to Taiwan. After landing in Keelung, they were quickly taken by bus to Pingtung. They voluntarily came to the barracks from schools and families to begin this less free group discipline life, but their strong will and self-confidence cannot completely bury their original innocence. When reporters, after passing through strict security lines of questioning and guidance, arrived at the barracks to interview them, some of them could not hold back and were already complaining. They told reporters with a bit of shyness and a smiling face: "We have no freedom, we can't see newspapers, we can't go out casually."</p>
<p>They have been in Pingtung for only a few days and have had little contact with the outside world. When they met the reporters, they stared with strange eyes at someone who seemed completely unfamiliar to them. When they learned that reporters had come to interview them, they became even more excited. Some of the young ladies from Shanghai, in particular, seemed very friendly. They competed to speak with the reporters in the Shanghai dialect, talking about everything under the sun.</p>
<p>Although they have already put on light green uniforms and skirts, their various styles of shoes and socks, and various styles of hairstyles, still cannot hide that they are young ladies from the city. Some still have permed and fluffy curly hair, some wear thick glasses, some are in the style of students, and some are like young ladies from secluded chambers. In the simple barracks, everything has not yet been arranged. A military blanket spread on the wooden floor is where they sleep and rest. Their only pastime is to talk with their comrades and sisters. The reporters asked them if they missed home. They said they wouldn't have come if they missed home. When asked if they were getting enough to eat, they said they were getting enough to eat, but the vegetables were a bit scarce. It is said that when they left Shanghai, many of their parents drove small cars, crying and laughing, to the pier to chase them back, but these stubborn young ladies would rather sacrifice the warmth of their families to accept hard training. This spirit is truly moving.</p>
<p>One of their team leaders told reporters that they are all unmarried young ladies, because the superiors stipulated that they would not accept married women. This time, a total of 400 female students were recruited from all over the country, and a large team will be established to concentrate on training in Pingtung. Only an advance unit has arrived now, because they have only been here for a few days, and everything is not yet ready. The barracks facilities and life management all seem disorganized. They are scheduled to begin training on the 13th. In addition to basic military training and physical activities, the training courses mainly include political work, medical assistance, and intelligence work skills training. During the training period, all are under military management. General Sun Li-jen pays close attention to the lives and training of these girls and is particularly cautious about the selection of instructors. Service officers and even service workers in the team headquarters have all been decided to be women. The selection of the team leader, it is said, is still under careful consideration by General Sun Li-jen.</p>
