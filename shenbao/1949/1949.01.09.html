<h3>美國務卿的更迭　——從馬歇爾到艾契遜</h3>
<p>美國務卿馬歇爾因病辭職，業經杜魯門總統批准，遺缺由前國務副卿艾契遜繼任·消息傳出，因馬卿倦勤之說盛傳巳久，故世人對於此次國務卿的更迭，並不驚異。同時杜魯門總統宣佈馬卿辭職的消息之時，首即明白表示美國外交政策，決不因國務卿更迭而有所改變，質言之，即一面支持聯合國機構以維護世界和平，另一面則仍以堅定不移之態度應付蘇聯，絕不軟化。但在世局動盪不定美國遲疑不決之今日，美國更換國務卿，無論如何，終是一九四九年的第一件世界大事，不論對於美國本身或世界各國，均將引起重大的影響，尤其在第八十一屆新國會剛剛開幕對於美國外交政策將作新的決策之際，更有非常深刻的意義。</p>
<p>我們綜合華盛頓·倫敦·巴黎曁世界各大都市的輿論，對於馬歇爾國務卿的辭職，莫不表示惋惜；而對於艾契遜的繼任國務卿，同時莫不表示歡迎。良以馬歇爾元帥，誠如杜魯門總統所稱，實為「美國最偉大的軍人」，對於第二次大戰的獲勝，有無上輝煌的貢獻，當其出任國務卿之初，世人都矚望其能以作戰的毅力與韜略，與其他各聯合國致力於世界和平的締造。無如其就任國務卿二年以來，世局變化莫測，以致力不從心。世界的兩極化，粉碎了世人對於「一個世界」的幻想，美蘇一泠戰」，又因馬歇爾計劃在西歐積極實施而益趨劇烈，柏林危機的惡化，幾使「泠戰」也要流血發熱，變為眞正的國際戰爭。杜魯門總統為打開美蘇兩國間的僵局起見，本有派遣大員前往莫斯科直接談判的計劃，後因馬歇爾自巴黎遄返華府表示異議而打消。惟馬杜二氏對於外交政策乃由此發生意見的分岐，雖經杜魯門總統一再矢口否認，但客觀事實的存在是無法掩飾的。再加以去年大選杜魯門獲勝，民主黨在八十一屆新國會中又恢復多數，杜魯門總統更有統一其外交政策的必要，所以，馬歇爾辭職是勢所必至的事情。</p>
<p>以言新任國務卿艾契遜，為前國務卿赫爾所稱的「傑出人才」，於一九四一年即任助理國務卿，主管世界經濟事務，竭力主張美國應積極援助英蘇兩國，精明能幹，素為赫爾國務卿所器重。後來貝爾納斯為國務卿，於一九四五年八月又將共昇任副國務卿，用了成爲美國外交政策的決定者之一；就是到了馬帥自華返國出任艱鉅，仍留任為副國務卿，至一九四七年五月間始辭職，　出美國的政界，重新執行他的律師職務。艾氏在思想上原有「實際的自由主義者」之稱，因在大戰期聞竭力主張援蘇，又有「親蘇外交家」之稱，但在他去職的前夕，却在國會中宣佈「蘇聯是力求擴張的帝國主義」，世人對於他作一百八十度的大轉變，大半不甚瞭解，其實說來也非常簡單，因為他負美國外交的實際責任，深知蘇聯的阻撓和平與破壞國際協定，乃轉而採取强硬的反蘇政策。他有一句名言，傳誦全球，就是：「莫斯科政策與國際協調及復興基礎，不啻背道而馳。」這次艾契遜出任國務卿，必能大展其才能，故為美國朝野所一致歡迎。</p>
<p>艾契遜對於中國問題，也有其卓越的見解。他曾謂。。「美國之主要目標，乃在輔助中國統一，建立一元化之陸軍；並對於中國各黨派所組成之聯合政府予以經濟的援助。」準此而論，成功湖畔的聯合國人士，認為艾契遜出任國務卿，對於中國問題之發展，將有直接影響，並非毫無根據的言論。美國新國會巳於三日開幕，對於美國今後的外交方針將作新的決策，這次國務卿的更迭，或即為美國外交政策轉變的開端吧。</p>

<h3>物價高漲發行額增加　台秈臨嚴重考騐　省府正以兩種方法防止膨脹</h3>
<p>〔聯合社台北八日電〕台幣一向比較穩定，近已面臨一嚴重考騐。一班富戶及政府人員紛紛來此，物價逐漸高漲，發行數額亦在不斷增加中。一九四五年台灣銀行發行總數為台幣二億八千萬元，一九四六年底已增至五億，一九四八年底當已超過一百億。惟據該行總經理稱，發行額之半數係貸與國營事業，最著者為全國資源委員會經營之台糖公司及電力公司，目的在促進生產事業，故應視為投資。雖形似通貨膨脹，實際為扶助生產，台幣本身亦可藉以維持。如台糖生產，每四萬噸需用資金一千萬元，包括肥料·農貸·修理機器及鐵道運輸在內，但其所獲利潤，亦可得一千萬元。台省政府現以兩種方法防止通貨膨脹，其一為隨時調整台幣對金圓券之匯率，其二為刺激生產，以吸收游資。惟去歲中央改革幣制，及金圓券之貶値，已影饗及於台幣，在八一九後七十二天中，發行額由二十億驟增至八十億，後因前任省主席魏道明之堅持，財部始允隨時調整台幣對金圓券之匯率·惟此舉對於台幣發行額，及市塲購買力之增加，是否足以相抵，尙難預測</p>

<h3>埃猶同意舉行和談　彭契建議羅特島談判地點</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖七日電〕巴勒斯坦調解員彭契七日建議，埃及以色列雙方應於十二日在羅得島開始休戰談判。雙方代表指出，渠等之國家均將同意，但須由開羅及台拉維夫方面作最後決定，彭契在安理會審査尼基夫區撤軍執行情形之特種委會上透露此項迅卽開始休戰談判之建議，渠並對七國委會稱，在休戰會談開始前，安理會實無須考慮新行動。</p>

<h3>艾契遜繼任美國務卿　西歐國家表歡迎　舉世注視症狀今後外交動向</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦七日電〕英外相貝文七日稱，全世界尤其是歐洲，對於美國務卿馬歇爾之辭職，表示扼腕。渠繼稱，「繼任的艾契遜對吾人並不生疏，渠必能獲得吾人間繼續合作之保證」。貝文對馬卿之惜別，代表歐洲對華盛頓宣佈馬卿將於二十日辭退之宣佈的最高反應，西方官方人士顯然對此項改變是否將為馬歇爾限制杜魯門直接參加國際事務之鐵腕之解除深感眩感。</p>
<p>東歐外交家表示渠等之觀點及私人希望，此項轉變將改變美國之冷戰政策，而代以對蘇聯稍趨緩和的態度。柏林蘇區市畏伊伯特稱，渠認為馬歇爾之辭職，可能使美國之外交政策稍趨緩和。東歐及若千不主張美國之冷戰策略之人士對馬卿之辭退表示歡欣。某「鐵幕」外交家稱，「阻止杜魯門派遣大法官文生赴莫斯科者，卽為馬歇爾。」</p>
<p>但在目前，大部份歐洲官員均凖備接受杜魯門之「美國外交政府將無改變」之諾言，但明白說明渠等正採取觀望之政策。</p>
<p>〔合衆肚成功湖七日電〕中國駐聯合國代表蔣廷黻七日對美新國務卿艾　遜之「人格及才幹」，備加頌揚，但對馬歇爾則隻字不提。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓七日電〕華府觀察家對馬歇爾氏之辭職，及艾契遜之繼任國務卿一事，認為美國外交政策或將更傾向於自由主義。美國對外政策大綱雖不致有所更動，艾契遜則可能作一部份修改。但此輩觀察家認為美國之對蘇政策則絕不致有任何改變，仍將採取一貫之强硬態度。然此輩並非謂彼將關閉和平談判之門戶，自今以後，美國之外交政策將完全操於文官之手。經濟專家魏勃之被任為副國務卿，可表示經濟問題將在美國外交政策上佔空前未有之重要地位。</p>
<h3>艾存孫略歷</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓七日電〕美國新任國務卿艾契遜於一八九五年四月十一日生於康湼狄克州之台特鎭，曾在哈佛大學與耶魯大學攻習法律，後操律業。第一次世界大戰時任美海軍軍官，戰後任最高法院法官勃蘭狄斯之私人秘書。一九三三年五月至十一月間任財政次長，一九四一年任助理國務卿，一九四五年代格羅任副國務卿。艾氏以主張自由主義馳譽。</p>
<p>艾契遜現年五十五歲，曾在羅斯福與杜魯門總統任內襄助赫爾·史丹丁紐斯及貝爾納斯等歷屆國務卿約六年之久，直至馬歇爾出任國務卿後六個月始辭去副卿一職。最初，艾氏似乎遵循羅斯福總統之戰後對蘇親善政策，致遭同僚攻訐，旋因力謀樹立「世界眞正和平尙未實現，蘇聯與西方各國齟齬叢生，遂轉而採取强硬防共立塲，其在職時最後一次演說指斥蘇聯阻撓和平與破壞國際重要協定，所謂「莫斯科政策與國際協調及復興基礎背道而馳」一語，迄今播傳人口。馬歇爾任內美對蘇兩大冷戰攻勢，卽軍事援助希土援歐復興計劃，悉出艾氏輔佐　劃。（聯合社）</p>

<h3>Government Efforts to Promote Peace: Invitation to Four Nations to Mediate, Meeting Between Zhang Qun and Bai Chongxi</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] In the days of awaiting the Communist Party's formal response to the President's peace appeal, the government has already begun to invite the four major powers to mediate the issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, so as to promote the early realization of peace. On the 8th, it was confirmed that this formal invitation and the solutions proposed by the government have been sent out. This is the greatest manifestation of the government's efforts for peace. Many people are watching for the appearance of this glimmer of hope, hoping that the Communist Party will announce its agreement to resume peace talks as soon as possible. However, when reporters inquired about the above news from government officials, they all answered with a silent attitude. The reporter also visited a senior official who has made many efforts for peace. He confirmed the authenticity of the above news, but said that he had not yet received a reply from the other party.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] It is confirmed that Wu Tiecheng, concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, invited the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France to meet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the evening of the 8th. However, the Ministry and the embassies declined to comment on the content of the meeting. According to reliable sources, the Chinese government has asked the three ambassadors to ask their governments to mediate for peace. The fact that the Soviet ambassador was not present has aroused speculation. It is said that he was ordered by Moscow to avoid participating in the mediation.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] It was learned today that most of the peace activities are now centered on Vice President Li Zongren. Li has repeatedly met with Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi and others.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Zhang Qun flew to Hankou by special plane on the morning of the 8th at the invitation of Bai Chongxi. Zhang visited the President twice on the evening of the 7th and the morning of the 8th. On the morning of the 8th, Zhang also had breakfast with the President at his official residence on Huangpu Road, and they had a pleasant conversation. Before Zhang took off, Yu Jishi went to the airport to see him off. His entourage included Huang Shaohong and Zhou Junliang. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing in three days. However, it is reported that Zhang may go to Peiping after leaving Hankou.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 8th] Political Commissar Zhang Qun arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing at noon on the 8th. Bai Chongxi, Zhang Dulun, Zhang Zhen, Xu Zuyi and other military and political leaders, as well as Air Force Commander Luo Ji, all went to the airport to welcome him. Zhang's special plane arrived at Wangjiadun Airport at 12:45 pm. After getting off the plane, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers one by one in the warm air, looking very happy. Then he went to the official residence with Bai in the same car for a meeting and lunch together. In the afternoon, he continued to talk with Bai. Those present included Zhang Dulun, Zhang Zhen, and Huang Shaohong. It is confirmed that Zhang came here at the invitation of Commander-in-Chief Bai. He reported to the President before leaving. As for Huang Shaohong, who was traveling with him, he came to Hankou to visit friends on the way.

<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 8th] The Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Area General Headquarters recently sent a telegram to the military and political leaders in its jurisdiction, urging them to strengthen military-political coordination and recognize the stance on peace and war. The original telegram expounded on the President's proclamation of the principle of being able to pursue both peace and war, emphasizing the proposition that peace can only be achieved through strength. The wording was extremely clear, concise, and sincere. The conclusion of the document is recorded below: "Now the people are eager for peace, and the government is willing to realize peace. Public opinion and the government have reached a consensus. The opportunity for peace has been opened. However, the key is that the Chinese Communists can suddenly realize and sincerely accept it. Otherwise, if they continue to engage in military aggression and exploit the people, violating public opinion, it will still be impossible to realize true peace. At this critical turning point, administrative leaders at all levels and all officers and soldiers should be aware of the difficulties of the times, confirm that both war and peace are possible, and especially believe that peace can only be achieved through strength. They should still actively prepare for war, strengthen military-political coordination, hold their posts, and do their best without the slightest slackness, so as not to be taken advantage of by the enemy. It is hoped that everyone will be of one mind, unite and fight hard, and save the country from danger in order to achieve peace. This is what is greatly hoped."</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 8th] According to a senior official close to Zhang Qun, the views of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Area authorities and local figures on the current issues of peace and war are completely in line with those of the central government. The rumor that the reaction from all walks of life in Wuhan after the President's proclamation was quite uneasy is purely speculation. When a public opinion organ discusses a certain issue, there may be differences and intense debates, but its final conclusion is still consistent with the government. Judging from Commander-in-Chief Bai's telegram to his subordinates, it can be seen that the sincerity of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Area in seeking peace through war can be said to be firm and clear.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 8th] Jiangxi Chairman Hu Jiafeng exceptionally received our reporter in his office on the morning of the 8th and spoke freely about Jiangxi's administration and peace talks. After the President's New Year's Day proclamation, Hu believes that the national government has repeatedly sought peace, and whether the peace talks can succeed depends on sincerity and integrity. Today, we should be prepared for war to seek peace, and prepare for war to seek peace talks. Hu believes that the rumor that Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces are making political contacts is unfounded. He solemnly stated that he has not received any letters or contacts of the above-mentioned nature in the past or in the future.</p>
<h3>President Busy Handling Official Affairs After New Year's Day Proclamation</h3>

<p>Both Eagerly Hope for Early Realization</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 8th] Our reporter visited the famous Zhejiang University in Hangzhou on the 8th. Due to financial difficulties, the rooms have not been heated. President Zhu Kezhen received the reporter in the president's office wearing a coat and told him about the difficulties. Zhu modestly said that he does not understand politics, but he is very much in favor of peace. Since both sides claim to be fighting for the people, they should lay down their arms now that the people demand peace. He was very saddened by the loss of China's lofty international status due to the civil war. He said: Now that India is convening an Asian conference, we should reflect and feel ashamed, and then strive to improve. The reporter then visited many professors at the school, and they all eagerly hoped for the early realization of peace. In addition, Zhejiang University will have a big exam next week, and the issue of relocating the school has not been considered, and the Ministry of Education has not given any instructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changsha Dispatch, 8th] Hu Shuhua, President of National Henan University, recently talked to reporters about the issue of peace. Hu said in an extremely painful tone: "Only with peace can China be saved. This is true not only for the people under the rule of the central government, but also for the people under the rule of the Communist Party, because if the fighting continues, the country will really be beyond repair, and the people's suffering will be too deep and too heavy." He continued: "Hunan cannot be ruined again. The losses suffered during the Anti-Japanese War were greater than those of any other province. If it is ravaged by war again, Hunan's vitality will be completely lost." When asked how to achieve peace, Hu hoped that public opinion organs in various provinces would launch and lead the people to expand the movement to call for peace.</p>

After an investigation by the Central Standing Committee of our party, it was proved that Mr. Liang is currently recuperating in a hospital due to eye disease.

General Du Yuming commanded 120,000 elite soldiers and engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat with the remnants of Liu and Chen's bandit troops in the icy and snowy ground on the line of Qinglongji, Lulou, and Suixikou. The battle situation was extremely fierce. The air force also cooperated in the clear sky to assist in the battle. The bandit troops suffered heavy casualties. Therefore, Liu's bandits in Nanping rushed to reinforce them. There are currently no battles in the areas of the Hui, Xie, and Fei rivers. According to the spokesman of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui Border Area General Headquarters, a small number of bandit remnants in Huaibei will never be able to attack Bengbu. As for the scattered bandits such as the Huainan Independent Brigade in eastern Jinpu Road, after being encircled and suppressed by the National Army for days, only 5,000 to 6,000 people are left.

The strong National Army immediately met them head-on and dealt them a heavy blow. The bandits were unable to withstand it and fled back to the mountainous areas on the border between Anhui and Hubei. The National Army successively recovered the three counties of Liuan, Huoshan, and Lihuang on the 6th, and the situation in central Anhui also tended to stabilize.</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Coastal Area Is Peaceful; Command Structure Will Be Adjusted Soon; Zhou Yan Expresses Optimism About the Future of the War</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 8th] The battlefield in northern Jiangsu is generally peaceful. Since the National Army stationed in Gaoyou and Tianchang, Yangzhou has become more stable. The highways of Yangtai, Yangzhen, and Yangyou are all clear. The northern Jiangsu coastal area, including Haimen, Qidong, Nantong, Rugao, Jingjiang, Taixing, Taixian, Yangzhou, Yizheng, and Liuhe counties, is under the control of the National Army. After the East China bandit army was defeated in Xuzhou and Bengbu, it seems that it is still difficult to carry out large-scale operations in northern Jiangsu for a while. The bandits currently in northern Jiangsu are all local communists under the command of the "Military Region," but their strength is quite large. According to Zhou Yan, the bandits can reorganize this local communist army into a column number at any time. The reason why they don't do this is to avoid the attention of the authorities.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 8th] Zhou Yan, Commander of the First Pacification District, told our reporter today that to defend the Yangtze River, we must first protect the Huai River. Otherwise, for the sake of protecting Nanjing and Shanghai, we should at least ensure the three strongholds of Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Tongzhou in northern Jiangsu. Zhou seemed optimistic about the future of the war. He said that if the war were to extend to the Yangtze River, we would have the coordination of the navy in addition to the land and air forces, which would be a more advantageous condition. Zhou was not satisfied with the current connections between all levels of society in northern Jiangsu. He hopes that the local gentry and representatives of public opinion in his jurisdiction can understand the difficulties of the times and not unnecessarily restrain the work of military and political leaders. According to reports, Zhou was summoned to Nanjing by Tang Enbo on the 2nd for consultations and returned to Yangzhou on the evening of the 6th. It is said that it was decided during the talks that the command structure in northern Jiangsu would be adjusted soon.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Washington Dispatch, 7th United Press] Reliable sources say that after Acheson is appointed as the new Secretary of State, the policy toward China may be further considered.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Change of U.S. Secretary of State: From Marshall to Acheson</h3>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marshall resigned due to illness, which has been approved by President Truman. Upon the news, the world was not surprised by this change of Secretary of State, because the rumors about Marshall's fatigue had been circulating for a long time. At the same time, when President Truman announced Marshall's resignation, he made it clear that U.S. foreign policy would not change due to the change of Secretary of State. In other words, it will support the United Nations organization to maintain world peace on the one hand, and deal with the Soviet Union with a firm attitude on the other, without softening. However, in today's turbulent world situation and the indecision of the United States, the change of U.S. Secretary of State is, in any case, the first major world event of 1949. It will have a significant impact on the United States itself and all countries in the world, especially at a time when the Eighty-first New Congress has just opened and is about to make new decisions on U.S. foreign policy, it has a very profound meaning.</p>
<p>We summarize the opinions of Washington, London, Paris, and major cities around the world, and all express regret for the resignation of Secretary of State Marshall; and at the same time, all express welcome for Acheson's succession as Secretary of State. Because Marshal Marshall, as President Truman said, is "the greatest soldier in the United States," and has made unparalleled and brilliant contributions to winning World War II. When he first took office as Secretary of State, the world expected him to work with other United Nations to create world peace with the perseverance and strategy of warfare. However, since he took office as Secretary of State two years ago, the world situation has changed unpredictably, and he has been unable to do what he wants. The polarization of the world shattered the world's illusion of "one world." The U.S.-Soviet "Cold War" has intensified due to the active implementation of the Marshall Plan in Western Europe. The deterioration of the Berlin crisis almost made the "Cold War" also bleed and heat up, turning into a real international war. In order to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union, President Truman originally planned to send senior officials to Moscow for direct negotiations, but this was dismissed because Marshall returned from Paris to Washington to express his disagreement. However, the two men, Marshall and Truman, had differences of opinion on foreign policy. Although President Truman has repeatedly denied it, the existence of objective facts cannot be concealed. In addition, Truman won the general election last year, and the Democratic Party regained its majority in the Eighty-first New Congress. President Truman needs to unify his foreign policy even more, so Marshall's resignation was inevitable.</p>
<p>As for the new Secretary of State Acheson, he was called a "outstanding talent" by former Secretary of State Hull. In 1941, he served as Assistant Secretary of State, in charge of world economic affairs, and vigorously advocated that the United States should actively assist Britain and the Soviet Union. He was intelligent and capable, and was always valued by Secretary of State Hull. Later, when Byrnes was Secretary of State, he was promoted to Under Secretary of State in August 1945, and became one of the decision-makers of American foreign policy. Even when Marshal Marshall returned to China to take on difficult tasks, he remained as Under Secretary of State until he resigned in May 1947 and left American political circles to resume his lawyer duties. Acheson was originally known as a "practical liberal" in his thinking. Because he vigorously advocated aid to the Soviet Union during the war, he was also known as a "pro-Soviet diplomat." However, on the eve of his departure, he announced in Congress that "the Soviet Union is an imperialist seeking expansion." Most people did not understand his 180-degree turn. In fact, it is very simple, because he is actually responsible for American diplomacy and knows that the Soviet Union's obstruction of peace and the destruction of international agreements have turned him to adopt a tough anti-Soviet policy. He has a famous saying that has been recited around the world: "Moscow's policy is contrary to the basis of international coordination and revitalization." Acheson's appointment as Secretary of State this time will surely enable him to display his talents, so he is unanimously welcomed by the American government and the public.</p>
<p>Acheson also has his own unique views on the China issue. He once said, "The main goal of the United States is to assist China in unifying and establishing a unitary army; and to provide economic assistance to the coalition government composed of various Chinese parties." Based on this, United Nations personnel at Lake Success believe that Acheson's appointment as Secretary of State will have a direct impact on the development of the China issue, which is not an unfounded statement. The new U.S. Congress opened on the 3rd, and will make new decisions on the future foreign policy of the United States. This change of Secretary of State may be the beginning of a change in U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Approves Adjustment of Public Education Treatment; Implemented Starting This Month and a Bonus Will Be Issued for One Month; Collective Savings Will Be Abolished and Public Petitions Will Be Prohibited; Yu Hongjun, President of the Central Bank, Dismissed</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, Eighth Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The 34th meeting of the Executive Yuan on the eighth approved the adjustment of public education personnel's salaries starting in January. The areas of Beijing and Shanghai will receive one and a half times their December salaries, which is 15 times the price limit of August 19. At the same time, in order to sympathize with the difficult lives of public education personnel, the government decided to issue an additional month's salary based on the adjusted salary amount for January, called the year-end bonus. The adjustment amounts in various regions of the country are not exactly the same. The principle is that the adjustment amounts are larger for those closer to the war zone. In addition, combat officers and soldiers will each receive two silver dollars as a year-end bonus.</p>

<p>[Nanjing, Eighth Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Yu Hongjun, President of the Central Bank, was dismissed for improper handling of gold and silver dollar savings and exchanges, which caused dissatisfaction from many parties. At the political meeting on the eighth, Finance Minister Xu first reported on the savings and exchanges of gold and silver, stating that the Central Bank had made some changes in the procedures for handling the savings and exchanges, but failed to report to the Ministry of Finance in advance, which seemed to have decided without authorization, and the errors in some procedures had led to today's uncontrollable situation of panic buying and withdrawals. After Xu's report, many committee members also felt it was inappropriate. Someone then suggested summoning Yu Hongjun to Beijing to report on the process of handling the savings and exchanges, but most people were still dissatisfied. It was decided to dismiss him, and Xu, the Finance Minister, will temporarily serve concurrently in his vacant position.</p>
<p>[Nanjing, Eighth Dispatch from the Central News Agency] At the Executive Yuan meeting on the eighth, Finance Minister Xu Kan reported on the request of some civil servants in Beijing to handle collective gold and silver savings and exchanges for military police and public education employees of the Central Bank in Shanghai at the old prices, and submitted a solution for public resolution. The Executive Yuan decided: (1) The Central Bank's handling of collective gold and silver savings and exchanges for military police and public education employees has different methods in Beijing and Shanghai, which is inappropriate. Personnel should be sent to thoroughly investigate and discuss the matter. The original collective gold and silver savings and exchanges method for military police and public education employees in Shanghai should be abolished immediately, and Nanjing should not use it as an example. (2) The lives of military police and public education employees are difficult. Their salaries have been adjusted, and an additional month's salary has been added in another case, which will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>[Further Dispatch] The Executive Yuan resolved on the eighth that, during the current period of martial law, all civil servants should work diligently and not gather to petition, obstructing public affairs. The chiefs of various levels should be responsible for restraining their subordinates and absolutely prohibiting unauthorized actions and violations of laws and regulations. If there are any deliberate violations, the highest commanders in each martial law area should strictly implement the provisions of Article 11, Paragraph 1 of the Martial Law Act. The Executive Yuan has issued notices to all ministries, commissions, and bureaus, and sent letters to other agencies and notified the military police agencies to investigate accordingly.</p>

<h3>Rising Prices and Increased Issuance; the Taiwan Dollar is Facing a Severe Test; the Provincial Government is Using Two Methods to Prevent Inflation</h3>
<p>[Taipei, Eighth Dispatch from the United Press] The New Taiwan dollar, which has always been relatively stable, is now facing a severe test. Wealthy households and government personnel have been flocking here, prices are gradually rising, and the amount of currency in circulation is constantly increasing. In 1945, the total amount of currency issued by the Bank of Taiwan was 280 million New Taiwan dollars. By the end of 1946, it had increased to 500 million. By the end of 1948, it probably exceeded 10 billion. However, according to the general manager of the bank, half of the amount of currency issued is loaned to state-owned enterprises, the most prominent being the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and the Power Company, operated by the National Resources Commission, with the aim of promoting production enterprises, so it should be regarded as investment. Although it looks like inflation, it is actually to support production, and the New Taiwan dollar itself can be maintained by this. For example, for Taiwan Sugar to produce 40,000 tons, it needs 10 million yuan in funds, including fertilizers, agricultural loans, repair of machinery, and railway transportation, but the profits it can obtain can also be 10 million yuan. The Taiwan Provincial Government is currently using two methods to prevent inflation. One is to adjust the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar against the Gold Yuan at any time, and the other is to stimulate production to absorb floating capital. However, last year's central currency reform and the devaluation of the Gold Yuan have already affected the New Taiwan dollar. In the 72 days after August 19, the amount of currency issued suddenly increased from 2 billion to 8 billion. Later, due to the insistence of the former Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming, the Ministry of Finance agreed to adjust the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar against the Gold Yuan at any time. However, it is still difficult to predict whether this measure is sufficient to offset the increase in the amount of New Taiwan dollars issued and the purchasing power of the market.</p>

A British Air Force communiqué released in London confirmed that the fifth aircraft shot down was also British.

At the same time, an Israeli spokesperson accused British aircraft of firing on Israeli positions in Nikif, and said that twelve British aircraft carrying bombs flew in formation to attack four Israeli fighter planes.

The protest was lodged by the British representative to the Israeli representative at a session of the Security Council. The British Foreign Office has already thoroughly reviewed the entire Jewish question.</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] The Philippines denounced the Security Council on the 7th for allowing the Netherlands to crush the Republic of Indonesia. Philippine representative Romulo condemned the positions taken by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands during the Security Council debate. He declared that 100 million people in Asia are being forced to consider non-military action to oppose Dutch actions. Romulo specifically mentioned the upcoming New Delhi Conference as foreshadowing "further united action" on the Indonesian issue, and said that the United Nations must remember that "the only way to democratize Asia is to give Asia freedom and give the people of Asia equal partnership in a better world. I ask the Security Council to consider this event and the human values related to this issue, first for all of Asia, and then for the entire world." In addition to Romulo's speech, during the Security Council debate on the afternoon of the 7th, Dutch representative Van Royen claimed that the Dutch "police action" had been completed, laying the foundation for the Indonesian Federation supported by Queen Juliana and her cabinet. Indonesian representative Palar retorted that the Netherlands was "fooling" the Security Council and that the Indonesian people had only "resistance to aggression and engaged in a war of self-defense." Australian representative Makin told the Security Council that when the Security Council's orders are being defied in Indonesia, "it is impossible to act like an ostrich and bury its head in the sand of Lake Success." Makin argued that the Netherlands should give Indonesian leaders complete freedom, withdraw troops from the conquered areas, and resume negotiations through the Committee of Good Offices. Egyptian representative Fawzi, who has just taken office as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, also joined in condemning Dutch policy, saying that if the Security Council succumbs to "this extremely bad fait accompli," it will endanger the entire future of the United Nations. Indian representative Ramalau accused the Netherlands of using U.S. aid to break Indonesia, which was "undermining the purpose of the European Recovery Program." The Committee of Good Offices reported to the Security Council that the Netherlands had not complied with the Security Council's ceasefire order and the order to release Indonesian leaders. The representatives of the five major powers did not speak at the meeting today. The Security Council adjourned today and will reconvene on the 11th to allow time to consider the report of the Committee of Good Offices.</p>

Bevin's farewell to Secretary Marshall represented the highest reaction in Europe to Washington's announcement that Secretary Marshall would resign on the 20th. Western officials were clearly dizzy as to whether this change would remove the iron hand of Marshall, who restricted Truman's direct participation in international affairs.</p>
<p>Eastern European diplomats expressed their views and personal hopes that this shift would change the US's Cold War policy, replacing it with a slightly more moderate attitude toward the Soviet Union. Berlin Soviet District Mayor Ebert said he believed Marshall's resignation might ease US foreign policy slightly. Eastern Europe and those who did not support the US Cold War strategy expressed joy at Marshall's resignation. One "Iron Curtain" diplomat said, "It was Marshall who prevented Truman from sending Chief Justice Vinson to Moscow."</p>
<p>But for now, most European officials are preparing to accept Truman's promise that "there will be no change in the US diplomatic government," but made it clear that they are adopting a wait-and-see policy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] Chinese representative to the United Nations Jiang Tingfu praised the "personality and talent" of the new US Secretary of State Acheson on the 7th, but did not mention Marshall at all.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] Washington observers believe that Marshall's resignation and Acheson's succession as Secretary of State may lead US foreign policy to be more inclined toward liberalism. Although the overall outline of US foreign policy may not be changed, Acheson may make some modifications. However, these observers believe that the US policy toward the Soviet Union will not change in any way and will continue to adopt a consistently tough stance. However, this does not mean that he will close the door to peace talks. From now on, US foreign policy will be entirely in the hands of civilians. The appointment of economic expert Webb as Deputy Secretary of State may indicate that economic issues will occupy an unprecedentedly important position in US foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Acheson's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] US Secretary of State Acheson was born in Tietown, Connecticut on April 11, 1895. He studied law at Harvard University and Yale University, and then practiced law. During World War I, he served as an officer in the US Navy, and after the war, he served as the private secretary to Supreme Court Justice Brandeis. He served as Undersecretary of the Treasury from May to November 1933, Assistant Secretary of State in 1941, and Acting Undersecretary of State in 1945. Acheson is known for advocating liberalism.</p>
<p>Acheson, 55, served under Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, assisting Secretaries of State Hull, Stettinius, and Byrnes for about six years until he resigned as Deputy Secretary six months after Marshall became Secretary of State. Initially, Acheson seemed to follow President Roosevelt's post-war pro-Soviet policy, leading to criticism from his colleagues. Later, he strived to establish that "a true peace in the world has not been realized, and conflicts between the Soviet Union and Western countries are rampant," and turned to adopting a tough anti-communist stance. His last speech in office accused the Soviet Union of obstructing peace and undermining important international agreements, and the phrase "Moscow's policy runs counter to the foundations of international coordination and reconstruction" has been widely circulated. The two major Cold War offensives of the US during Marshall's tenure, namely military aid to Greece and Turkey and the European Recovery Program, were all planned with Acheson's assistance.

<h3>Representatives of British Dominions Suggest Forming Eastern Anti-Communist Alliance; Urge Britain to Change Attitude Toward Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 8th (Radio): It is reported that representatives of British Dominions have submitted a request to the British government to organize an Eastern anti-aggression alliance in Asia similar to the Western alliance. Senior officials from various countries have presented evidence proving that after World War II, the Soviet Union is exploiting the national concepts of various Southeast Asian countries for other purposes. Official news said that representatives visited the British Foreign Office today, which is clearly related to the British Foreign Secretary Strong's trip to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] The High Commissioners of India, Pakistan, Australia, and New Zealand met with British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the morning of the 8th, strongly arguing that in order to prevent communism from invading from China to the south, it is necessary to obtain the friendship of the Republic of Indonesia, so Britain should show greater sympathy to Indonesia. Officials said that Britain had agreed on the 7th on a strategy to oppose communism in Southeast Asia, and Britain had suggested to the United States that it convene a meeting of relevant countries to strengthen the anti-communist camp of Asian democratic countries. The joint action of the four countries' representatives in London is said to be closely related to the upcoming New Delhi Asian Conference. Authorities pointed out that when the New Delhi Asian Conference was held last year, Asian Soviet countries also participated, but Indian Prime Minister Nehru did not invite Soviet countries to attend this time, which is indeed worth noting. The Foreign Office learned on the morning of the 8th that Indian Commissioner Menon intends to strongly advocate to Bevin the urgency of recognizing the Indonesian national faction and other expectations.</p>
<h3>Japanese General Election Approaching; Various Parties Fighting Fiercely Behind the Scenes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Japan will hold its third post-war House of Representatives election on the 23rd of this month, with the US occupation policy serving as an election gimmick. The extreme parties have long opposed the US economic plan for Japan, and most voters will take a middle course. There are 466 seats in the House of Representatives, with nearly 1,400 candidates, including 43 women. Only 40 of all the candidates are current members, about 900 are newcomers, and the rest are former members of the House of Representatives. Regardless of which party is in power, the Japanese people only hope to live and work in peace, but the parties are fighting fiercely behind the scenes. The recent US economic austerity order for Japan was caused by this. Various political parties are secretly using the name of the new US policy to carry out their own policy propaganda.</p>

<h3>Senate Cables Suggestion; Call National Peace Promotion Assembly; Invite Representatives from All Provinces and Cities to Participate in Shanghai</h3>

Please send the speakers and deputy speakers or responsible representatives of the senates of all provinces and cities, and the directors or standing directors of various national professional organizations to Shanghai as soon as possible to discuss and promote peace. The original cable is as follows:</p>
<p>"To the senates of all provinces and cities, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the National Industrial Association, the National Federation of Trade Unions, the National Banking Association, the National Money Trade Association, the National Cotton Textile Association, the National Flour Milling Association, the National Mining Federation, the National Insurance Association, the National Shipping Association, the National Electrical Industry Federation, the National Lawyers Association, the National Accountants Association, the National Medical Association, the National Journalists Association Federation, and the Ministry of Social Affairs in Nanjing for forwarding to various national professional organizations: The President has issued a New Year's message advocating peace. Within less than ten days, our compatriots across the country have unanimously called for its realization, which shows that peaceful unification is the same in everyone's mind. What Heaven sees and the people see, what Heaven hears and the people hear, the likes and dislikes of the people are already obvious. This association has sent a winter telegram inviting your association to jointly advocate, which I hope has been noted. However, I believe that peace is not something that can be achieved overnight and depends on the collective efforts of the people. This association believes that Shanghai is the location of several peaceful unification meetings since the Xinhai Revolution. The historical facts of success are still fresh in our memory, and the convenient transportation and the attention of China and foreign countries are especially conducive to the peace movement. Therefore, I suggest that the National Peace Promotion Assembly be solemnly convened in Shanghai on "February 10" of this year. I respectfully request that the speakers and deputy speakers of the senates of all provinces and cities or their designated responsible representatives, and the directors of various national professional organizations or mutually elected standing directors, come to Shanghai as soon as possible to discuss and promote peace. This association will do its best to entertain you sincerely. I firmly believe that the President and the government have already revealed peace and will adopt public opinion. The gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party must also be aware of the trend of public opinion, change their plans, stop the war, and make peace so that our people can recuperate and restore their vitality. Moreover, if both parties can reopen peace talks, some methods may not be without controversy along the way. Then, the task of mediating and resolving disputes, our public opinion representatives and professional representatives from all over the country, cannot shirk their responsibilities, and we come from all over the country and know the sufferings of the people better. We can also take advantage of the peace promotion assembly to contribute good plans for the rejuvenation of politics. When things reach their extreme, they will be restored, and new opportunities have emerged. I urge all gentlemen of your association to be happy to come, peace is fortunate, the people are fortunate, and I respectfully await your instructions. Shanghai Municipal Senate Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing respectfully bowed and sealed."</p>

It is now reported that this information is being compiled and sent by the Industrial Association one after another.

<p>More Than 5,000 People Benefited from the Emergency Medical Assistance Society; President Chiang Inscribes a Plaque, Worthy of the Ten Directors [Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Citizens' Emergency Medical Assistance Society has been established for more than two years, and has benefited more than 5,000 poor and sick people. Its work has been remarkable. The President, recognizing its commendable enthusiasm, specially inscribed a plaque with the words "Broadly Aiding Humanity" to commend it. The Municipal Government, in order to reward the directors of the society, specially photographed and reduced the plaque given by the President, cast it in silver, and inlaid it with a rectangular ivory piece, on which Mayor Wu inscribed a poem. The frame was adorned with mahogany, for a total of ten plaques, which were distributed to the ten directors of the society. Mayor Wu also hosted a tea party at the City Hall at 4:00 PM yesterday to entertain people from all walks of life, and held an award ceremony. Attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Zhang Wei, Fan Zhengbo, Yan Duhe, Keswick, President of the British Chamber of Commerce, Edward, representative of the American Relief Administration in China, members of the City Government Advisory Committee, and all the directors of the Emergency Medical Assistance Society: Rong Hongyuan (representing), Tang Yeru, Wang Qin Sun, Wang Tongyuan, Wu Zhongyi, Lu Jusen, Xue Zuheng (representing), Tang Shuming, Fu Liangjun, Gu Qianlin, and representatives of the Shuping Public Scholarship Association, who were responsible for the society's service work, totaling more than 200 people. Mayor Wu first delivered a speech, explaining the significance of the tea party. Then, Director of the Health Bureau Zhang Wei reported on the situation of the society. Immediately afterwards, the award ceremony was held, with Mayor Wu personally presenting the plaques to each director, and the attending guests responded with enthusiastic applause. Subsequently, Pan Gongzhan, Keswick, Edward, and Fan Zhengbo delivered speeches respectively. Finally, Gu Qianlin, director and president of the society, delivered a thank you speech. The tea party adjourned at around 6:00 PM. Excerpts from Mayor Wu and others' speeches are as follows:</p>
<p>The Motivation to Help Others is Most Worthy of Praise Mayor Wu stated: The Municipal Government awarded Zhang Hanting the honorary citizen medal last week, believing that his spirit of great virtue, great benevolence, and great courage was worthy of praise. Today, presenting the plaque inscribed by the President to the Emergency Medical Assistance Society has the same significance and is worthy of commemoration. Some people believe that there are many bad people and bad things in Shanghai, but in fact, there are also many good people and good deeds. The wicked should be punished, and the good should be praised. Therefore, a plaque presentation ceremony was specially held, and a tea party was held to entertain people from all walks of life for encouragement. Director Zhang reported: The society was established on October 1, 1946, and has been in existence for two years and three months. In the first year, more than 1,400 people were assisted, and more than 800 million legal tender was spent on loans. In the second year, more than 11.4 billion legal tender was spent on assistance, benefiting more than 5,000 people. The society's expenses are not raised from external donations, but are entirely determined by the basic directors themselves. Chairman Rong Hongyuan recognizes 50%, and the rest is recognized by the directors. What I think is commendable is not the number of people saved or the money spent, but the motivation to help others. This spirit of charity must be expanded, so that heaven can be established on earth.</p>
<p>A Shortcoming in Society is That it Specializes in Exposing People's Shortcomings Pan Gongzhan said: The relief spirit of the Emergency Medical Assistance Society is truly admirable. For the past two or three years, following the mayor, I have discovered many worthy deeds of praise in Shanghai. We must excavate and commend them. There is a shortcoming in society now, that is, it specializes in exposing people's evil, "exposing darkness" has long become a fashionable term. You must know that suppressing evil and promoting good is a traditional virtue of our country. Because individual behavior originates from thought, and thought is imitated, so there must be good models to guide people into the right track. Promoting good lies in setting an example for others. There is one way in the world, which is to save people and benefit others. In Buddhism, there are the three interconnected words of "faith, vow, and action." Faith is believing that this matter is beneficial to the people and the world, vow is setting a will, and action is seeking its realization. The three are connected, and the result is that those who have a will will succeed. The working spirit of the Emergency Medical Assistance Society is worthy of being promoted. The ten directors are all worthy of becoming role models for humanity. Keswick praised the charitable work of the Emergency Medical Assistance Society and said that all the directors of the society were his personal friends, which he was very proud of. Edward spoke in Chinese, saying: Americans and Chinese are very different in doing charitable work. Americans mostly like to promote and show off when doing relief work, while Chinese do it silently. Emergency loan work is worthy of praise, and it is hoped that similar righteous deeds can emerge like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>Many Frozen Corpses on the Streets; A Request for Relief is Attached Fan Zhengbo said that the work of the Emergency Medical Assistance Society is worthy of being recorded by the news media. And incidentally contribute a point of view, recently more and more people have been frozen to death on the streets, and most of them are children. This phenomenon is a great shame for Shanghai. It is hoped that the mayor will take the lead, and philanthropists will cooperate to provide relief. The mayor replied that the authorities have already paid attention. Four mobile collection vehicles are dispatched every night to transport the refugees on the streets to shelters. Recently, a very tragic sight has been discovered in the city, that is, there are many abandoned babies. Every night, they are found. How can newborns withstand the cold? Therefore, I hope that parents who want to abandon their babies, for whatever reason, can hand them over to the Municipal Relief Association for care.</p>
<p>Helping Others is the Root of Happiness; Society Affairs are Determined to be Promoted for a Long Time Gu Qianlin, on behalf of the society, said: The society is extremely moved by the President's grand gift of a plaque and the Mayor's tea party.

<p>Hot Money Flows In, Price Hikes Become Unstoppable Financial Authorities to Restrict Remittances from Other Areas to Shanghai [Report from Our Newspaper] Price hikes have become unstoppable. Yesterday, white rice exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark, and cotton cloth prices rose by about 40%. Due to the influx of remittances from various regions, the amount of hot money in the market has increased significantly. In addition to the continuous flow from Central and Northern Jiangsu, funds returning from Southern China are no less than 1 billion. Therefore, it is estimated that the amount of hot money in the market is currently close to 2.1 billion. It is only natural that it is stirring up trouble. In order to stabilize the market, financial authorities have begun to restrict remittances from other areas to Shanghai and will continue to sell materials to absorb hot money. However, because the government controls a limited amount of materials, and the power of hot money is endless, a small amount of sales is close to "gift-giving," so only the passive measure of restricting remittances from other areas can be taken.</p>
<p>Production Loan Review Committee Approves Emergency Production Loans [Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Discounting Committee for Production and Export Business Loans Review Committee held its seventh meeting yesterday, discussing a total of 46 cases related to emergency industrial loans and finished product purchases for industries such as machinery, electrical machinery, hardware, dyeing and weaving, hat making, rubber, and flour.

<p>Adjustment of Import Quotas for Southern China: Transportation Control Committee is Planning It The International Trade Association here believes that with the current economic center shifting south, the government should make necessary adjustments to trade measures. According to Chen Junren, Acting Chairman of the Import and Export Control Committee, regarding imports and exports, a comprehensive assessment is currently being made based on the export costs of each region and the export situation at the end of last year, so that close coordination can be achieved between the regions. The National Bank is also being asked to facilitate the use of funds by exporters so that export figures can be increased. As for whether the exchange rate for export settlements in Wuzhou and Guangzhou should be lower than in Shanghai, it must be studied before a decision can be made. Regarding imports, the import quotas allocated to various ports in Southern China in the past may be insufficient. In the seventh and eighth seasons, the committee approved US$2 million in imports beyond the quotas for Southern China in order to remedy the situation. It is indeed necessary to adjust the import quotas for Southern China, but the current trade is a chain of imports and exports, which should be determined according to the export situation and the needs of the various ports in Southern China. However, the existing industries in Central China, Shanghai, and Northern China must be maintained, and exports should also be assisted in order to fulfill the government's responsibilities. As for import and export visa procedures, efforts will be made to expedite and simplify them.</p>

<p>Silk Continues to Rise Yesterday, because it was Saturday, most of the transactions were for payment on Monday next week.

The afternoon closing was at 83,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 21,000 yuan. The rest generally rose together. Because raw material prices jumped sharply yesterday, costs increased, and the cost of living index in the first ten days of this month also rose with the prices of goods, people were optimistic. The Meiya quilt cover was first opened at a high price of 46,500 yuan, and the Huaqiang was at 46,000 yuan. After the shout, the cotton cloth prices jumped, and buying interest was very strong, and the market price rose again.

Until the close, the Meiya was at 43,500 yuan, and the Huaqiang was at 43,000 yuan, each rising by about 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Inventory is Depleted, Sources are Exhausted, Export Goods Will Be Reduced Again According to export industry news, since the beginning of the new year, the export business in the city has not improved. Those in charge of the export industry predict that export materials will be reduced even more in this month than in December last year. The reasons are: (1) The inventory of export materials in the city has been depleted. In order to ensure the safety of materials, exporters have already exported them early in November and December last year. (2) Because the war zone has expanded and transportation is blocked, materials purchased by exporters in the production areas cannot be transported to Shanghai. (3) In recent months, many export companies have moved to Guangzhou and Taiwan. Most of them only have an office in Shanghai, with no business. In the current situation, the future of the export industry in the city is worrying. Export settlement income will also decrease accordingly.</p>

<h3>British Industrial Exhibition Invites Chinese Manufacturers to Participate</h3>
<p>According to information from the International Trade Department of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently received a notice from the British National Industrial Exhibition stating that the exhibition is scheduled to be held simultaneously in London and Birmingham from May 2nd to May 13th of this year.

<h3>Public Education Kerosene Allocation Price Issue</h3>
<p>Petroleum Company Denies Being Unreasonable</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Petroleum Corporation of the Resources Committee has adjusted the allocation price of kerosene for public and educational personnel in this city for November and December of last year to 279.27 yuan per can. Officials from various institutions have expressed strong dissatisfaction and have jointly submitted a petition to the Public and Educational Personnel Material Supply Committee, requesting a reasonable reduction. According to the China Petroleum Corporation, the approved price of kerosene produced by the company was originally 334.75 yuan per can, which is significantly different from the 400 yuan price set by the three foreign petroleum companies in the city. However, since the raw materials for oil refining of the company and the foreign companies both come from the United States, the business has already suffered considerable losses. Furthermore, unlike other directly-administered institutions, the company does not receive government subsidies and relies entirely on the flexibility of exchange rate differences to maintain operations. There is no profit margin in the selling price. The decision on the allocation price for public and educational personnel should, on the one hand, consider the burden on public and educational personnel as much as possible, and on the other hand, it cannot ignore its own costs. Currently, the kerosene produced by the company in the market has risen to 470 yuan per can. Therefore, it is believed that the allocation price of 279 yuan is not unreasonable.</p>

<h3>Wang Renlin Issues Statement on Air Transportation of Refugees: Aircraft Rental is Decided by Headquarters, Companies' Opinions Will Be Forwarded on Their Behalf.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Far East Bureau of the International Refugee Organization is currently stepping up efforts to repatriate refugees and find ways to resettle them in other countries. The Geneva headquarters is also planning to transport refugees by air in emergency situations. The matter has been entrusted to the American Overseas Airlines to rent aircraft. Six airlines designated in China, including Pan American, Northwest, Air France, British Overseas, KLM Royal Dutch, and China National Aviation Corporation, reportedly had a slight misunderstanding after hearing the news. They believe that American Overseas Airlines did not apply to the Civil Aviation Administration for entry procedures in advance according to international civil transport procedures, and that the six companies in China are fully capable of transporting all refugees, and there is no need to recruit other companies. The Civil Aviation Administration sent Xiao Likun, director of the business department, to Shanghai a few days ago to listen to all parties' opinions and mediate the situation. Wang Renlin, director of the Far East Bureau of the International Refugee Organization, met with reporters yesterday and explained the matter. According to Wang, the Geneva headquarters recently rented three DC4 aircraft from American Overseas Airlines to transport refugees by air in order to speed up the completion of the refugee repatriation and resettlement work and to cope with the emergency situation of insufficient shipping space or the inability to obtain shipping. This was entirely decided by the Geneva headquarters, and the Far East Bureau was only ordered to implement it. It is also learned that the freight rates of American Overseas Airlines were decided after competition among various companies in Geneva, and that the company's flights to the Far East are only an extension of European flights. In addition to considering the freight rates, the International Refugee Organization also gave deep consideration to the efficiency and equipment of various companies. Director Wang expressed his gratitude to the six airlines in China for their willingness to participate in the air transportation of refugees. In addition to sending a letter of thanks, he has also forwarded the opinions of the various companies to the Geneva headquarters for approval. Finally, Wang stated that the number of refugees transported by air is extremely limited and must be used in emergency situations. Currently, refugees are still being transported mainly by ship. The Philippines recently approved the entry of 6,000 refugees, and the Bureau has rented three ships to send them there soon. Moreover, three more ships will carry refugees to Europe for transfer to various parts of Palestine.</p>
<h3>Year-End Bonus Payment Method Does Not Include Subsidies in Principle. Decided at the Second Meeting of the Handling Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Social Bureau's Year-End Bonus Handling Committee held its second committee meeting at the Social Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday.

<p>(1) Whether the payment of year-end bonuses should include other subsidies for joint payment. The resolution was that year-end bonuses should not include subsidies in principle, but industries with customary practices should still follow their customs. If there are no past customs to follow, the Social Bureau may handle disputes by considering the nature of the subsidies and the employer's ability to bear them. (2) Approved the year-end bonus payment method for temporary workers promoted to formal workers. It is stipulated that temporary workers who are promoted to formal workers within the statutory period should have their year-end bonus calculated proportionally from the time of their promotion to formal workers. The portion of their temporary employment period exceeding the statutory period should be included in the formal workers' service years for calculation, but only for this year. If there are past agreements, they should still follow their agreements.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Tai City Tricycle Puller Industry Workers' Union previously requested the Social Bureau to instruct employers to exempt vehicle rental for five days before and after the end of the year to serve as year-end bonuses. The Social Bureau believes that the relationship between the workers and the vehicle owners in the industry is a leasing relationship, which is different from the general labor-capital relationship, and there is no precedent to follow. It has approved that it should not be discussed.</p>
