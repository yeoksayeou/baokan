<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕籌組一週之何內閣，廿一日已宣告完成，並經國民黨在京中政。常委談話會全體可同意後，由代總統任命發表，全部閣員：一副院長，八部，二會首長及七政委共十八人，除留民。靑兩黨各一名空額之政委外，餘十六人均一并公布。統觀全部名單十六人中，新人佔九，蟬聨者七，較之已往改組內閣之換湯不換藥作風，已有顯著之進步。但所列新人中，甚少過去未作行政官者，如賈景德，張知本，李漢魂，端木傑，賀耀組，莫德惠，杭立武等七人，卽為走馬燈式之調職。新人僅劉攻芸，傳秉常二人而已。但就全部陣容觀察，保氏缺少體育場人系統，為一良好表現，但新閣中顯然仍乏大刀閽斧作風之新政治家，故就為政之風度言，何氏內閣陣容似有軟弱之感。此項名單係由何氏於廿一日上午二時換呈李代總統，經代總統批准後，於四時在總統府邀請在就國民黨中常委。中政委舉行談話會，分由李代總統及何院長說明組閣籌備之經過，及閣員名單之介紹，於五時半卽獲得出席人員全體之支持與同意，並卽由總統任命，當晚公布。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿一日電〕國民黨中常委於廿一日下午八時在南堤中央黨部會議廳開會，到吳鐵城·田崑山·鄒魯·李文範·蕭同茲·鄭彥棻·谷正鼎·劉文島·狄膺·姚大海·陳慶雲·胡一貫·呂曉道等，推鄒魯主席，通過推賈景德同志為行政院副院長案後卽散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕新閣將於三日內宣誓就職，並舉行首次政務會議，討論當前最切要之問題。聞和談問題卽為首要討論者，尤以和談代表目前僅邵力子。漲治中兩氏，廿三日將首次討論代表人選之增加及和談內容等等。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕傳秉常之被任為外長，並獲國民黨內餐多數人士　之同意，實為新閣作風之一新表現。惟傳以現任駐蘇大命名出任外長，是否表示當前餐交政生之將有變更，頗為政界人士所關切。記者頃曾詢若干人士對此之評論，多數人以下悉何氏政見，拒絕論外，僅某權威人士認為，不至於影響我當前外交政策，更不至於對閏外交有何刺激之處，因閏對我態度甚為明顯，決不至因此而有劇變。至於若干人杞憂之閏援問題，此權威人士則稱：「閏援希望原甚微」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨今晨九時召開中常會，將由張君勱親自主持，就參加新閣問題作最後決定。至於靑年黨之態度，據該黨發言人表示：本月十八日表明態度後，黨夜卽由常委王嵐僧攜李璜函晉京，面陳何應欽將軍，內懇切說明靑年黨支持何內閣之誠意，但說明在目前局勢下，不參加內閣，對何閣反多助力。王氏於昨晨返滬，靑年黨已無要員在京，所傳該黨將在新閣中擔任政委之說，實屬不確。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕顏惠慶昨表示：國共和談前途，誠屬夜長夢多。在四月之前，和談恐無法開始，因政府和談代表迄未推定，將來雙方之代表人選，可能於同一時間宣布。顏博士預測：和談開始後，可能拖延一兩個月而無所成就，惟因雙方對和平均有需要。最後終可獲致諒解。顏氏謂：本人因年高體衰，故不願出任正式代表，但如和談發生波折，仍願從中疏通。顏氏分析和談進行之程序，謂首先須覓取一談判之基礎，然後再就有關之政治·經濟·軍事各項問題依次解決，內中尤以裁軍問題最為複雜困難，似應設立一軍事小組委員會，處理此一機微棘手之課題。</p>

<p>問：張先生從何次會議起參加敵僞產業處理委員會？</p>
<p>答：從廿二次會議起，藍案係討論事項，第廿二次會議討論藍業珍呈請發還陰丹士　林顏料八十四桶，以保產權案，決議准予發還，如不能以種類品質相同之物給付，應照時値估價發還。本案通過，時僅葉公超之代表卽席聲明保留。</p>
<p>問：請將全部卷宗調閱。</p>
<p>答：此項卷宗在政院秘書處第七組，本人已於三月五日呈請辭職，請貴院直接調閱。</p>
<p>問：廿二次會議以後會議有否開過？</p>
<p>答：以後開過二次，廿四次在廣州開，本人未參加，由趙部長琛主持之。</p>
<p>問：藍案在廿二次會會上以何種方式提出？</p>
<p>答：以書面提出。</p>
<p>問：藍案在廿二次會中進行情形如何？</p>
<p>答：廿二次會出席人數連主席共十六人，除葉公超代表張廷錚聲明保留外，餘無異議。</p>
<p>問：藍業珍所有權有何根據？</p>
<p>答：藍業珍執有收據，但本人並未見過。</p>
<p>問：樂潤庭口供上有無說明倉單係藍業珍所有？</p>
<p>答：記不起來。</p>
<p>問：樂潤庭所申請發達之顏料係硫化靛靑，藍妮所申請發還者係陰丹士林靛靑，品質不同，價格亦異，有未硏究？</p>
<p>答：此等顏料種類相同，僅牌子有別，因根據棧單說明，並未研究此種問題。</p>
<p>問：樂潤庭對於顏料聲明獨資經理，並經人證明係其獨資經營，棧單上又無其他人名，處理委會對此有未硏究？</p>
<p>答；記得索卷中答具意見，依照上海商人習慣，可以由代理人出面。</p>
<p>問：代理人有未聲明係代理何人？且棧單交納亦係樂潤庭，而藍業珍申請已有此具有未研究？</p>
<p>答：開會時，委員多臨時到塲，在事實上並未深加研究，僅根據主管人的簽註。</p>
<p>問：張先生有無其他意見？</p>
<p>答：（一）照商人習慣，棧單不一定用本人名字；（二）清理處說藍業珍亦有收條，但收條並未見過；（三）藍業珍曾向清理處提出人證。</p>
<p>問：藍業珍提出人證後，行如何核示？</p>
<p>答：行政院認為人證足採取，以後此案移司法行政部解釋。</p>
<p>問：司法行政部意見如何？</p>
<p>答：司法行政部對藍業珍請求發還因非無很據，可由處理機關再行研究。</p>
<p>問：藍在提出人證後，政院認為不足採取以後，向清理處有未提出新證件？</p>
<p>答：記不清楚，須查案卷。</p>
<p>問：司法行政部對此作何解釋/</p>
<p>答：司法行政部解釋沒收敵僞產業政府應有舉證責任，此係般原則，至於藍業珍與樂潤庭則係另一事件。</p>
<p>問：報載本案經本院調查卽通知中信局停止付款，該項公函何時發出？</p>
<p>答：本人係以電話通知中信局停止付款，未批覆藍案業珍。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕記者頃就京滬各報廿一日所載「江北共軍業已完成渡江凖備工作」一事，叩詢此間某高級軍事負責人。據談：陳毅所部自經徐州週團三大會戰後，損失至重，二月餘來，謂其已完成兵員之補充則可，如謂已完成渡江凖備，則顯與事實不符；蓋江北一帶全係湖沼地區，河汊縱橫，原有公路及其橋棵多破爛不堪，絕非短期所能竣工，在該項工程未完成前，共軍卽無法運用其重砲部隊，重砲部隊如不能使用，卽無從壓制江上游動之國軍艦隻而遂行其敵前登陸之計謀，此其一。陳毅在江北所集結之十八個軍四十餘萬人，所需用于渡江攻勢的彈藥給養，憑目下江北所有運輸綫，共軍所有運輸力量，謂其已完成凖備，其誰置信？此其二。尤有要者，卽關於渡江工具，如船隻等之凖備，據各方調查報告，亦未臻完成階段，此其三。至如謂其已完成江北各橋頭堡之攻擊凖備，則尙有可能，但在和談未正式決裂前，共軍或不致出此，此亦所以連日來江北共軍僅作試探性攻擊，並未發動眞面目功勢之所以然。而不苝國軍亦迄保持各原有陣地。</p>

<p>〔本報靑島廿一日電〕親自率隊指揮轟炸重慶艦之空軍第二軍區陳嘉尙司令，廿一日晨九時由此飛京，報吿　懲叛艦任務吿一段落經過。巴氏行前數分鐘，在四十里外之司令部，與本報諧者通軍用電話，承吿，經最後偵察，該艦大部傾沉，艦底已經翻轉。語調至為果決興奮。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕重慶號叛艦經空軍鐵翼逋連續兩日之猛烈轟炸後，截至廿日上午止，業已迅速下沉。據廿日空軍偵察報吿：此次轟炸係集中該艦艦尾部份，投下炸彈命中者計達八千磅。十九日晚間已見該艦向右側傾斜並並漸吿下沉。廿日發現艦身左舷底三分之二朝天，艦面及指揮塔等部份已浸入海中，艦尾仍有濃烈之黑煙上衝，裊裊不斷。據空軍判斷：因戎蘆島港內深度不高，目前重慶號翻沉狀態恐已達頂點，完全沉沒，事實上絕不可能。惟僅以現在遠東所有各優良港口之設備，包括旅大在內，欲將該艦起出水面，曳往他處，或對其破壞部份加以整補修理，已決無辦法，卽將來戎蘆島港口一部份碼頭之使用，亦將因該艦沉沒關係，數年來當難望恢復。現空軍方面認為重慶號叛艦之機能業已完全喪失，故轟炸任務於廿日起卽全部終止。重慶號艦尾裝甲厚達三時，且防空火力極高，此間國外人士對我空軍能於兩日內順利達成炸沉任務，咸表驚奇。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕據悉：重慶號艦上被炸斃者約廿餘人，傷八十餘人，餘多登陸。海總桂永清總司令，自該艦叛變之消息獲得證實後，卽呈報國防部，並自請處分。</p>

<h3 id="c18">社論　對太平洋公約的看法 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>大西洋公約的內容公佈之後，各國的觀感頗不一致，但在遠東各國莫不盼望美國採取主動，組織類似大西洋公約的太平洋聯盟，其中尤以菲律賓總統季里諾的談話最為露骨。季氏分率直地說：「美國不應該將其全部的注意力集中在歐洲方面，而應該在遠東方面居於領導地位，首先發起組成類似大西洋公約的太平洋聯盟，藉以在遠東方面興共產主義作戰·美國如若將我們遺棄不顧，則美國將喪失其在遠東方面的廣大潛力。歐洲固有其經濟價值，但在亞洲也是一個擁有無限資源的處女地，美國實不應在東方令吾人失望。」因此他的結論是：「太平洋公約是切實可行的，實無反對的理由，正相反的，卻有許多利益。」</p>
<p>季里諾總統對於太平洋公約的熱望，溢於言表；其實，在遠東太平洋擾攘不安的今日，誰不希望有個區域安全機構呢？中國駐美大使顱維鈞博士評論大西洋公約時，也坦白表示：「大西洋公約的訂立，乃和平與安全主義的實貴成就，聯合國憲章的集體安全理想已局部實現；可惜此項公約僅包括世界和平陣綫的一面，世界和平如欲獲得切實保障，則和平陳　的另一面即亞洲，亦應有同樣防備侵略的組織。」顧大使雖未區接言及太平洋公約，但其盼望太平洋公約從早締結的情緒，初不亞於菲律賓總統。</p>
<p>商訂太平洋公約之議，傳說已久，其主要原因，乃在東南亞各國無不感受共產主義勞力的威脅，不得不共謀反共自衛之道，以確保遠東太平洋局部的安全與和平。緣自中國共產黨得勢以來，亞洲共黨勢力乃隨之南侵，日甚一日，不論是印尼·越南·馬萊亞·暹羅·緬甸，就是澳洲·菲律賓·即度，也巳感受到共黨的戚脅。印度總理尼赫魯於三月初發起召開東南亞自治領會議，表面上是為了緬甸的內亂，實際上還不是為了東南亞的區域安全？同時，澳外長伊瓦特為了本身的安全感起見，也極力主張東南亞應該成立一個類似西歐聯盟的組織，以抵抗外來侵略；並自告奮勇，以英國旣忙於歐洲事務無暇束顧，澳洲願意挺身而出，引導東南亞各自治領反共自衛。其實，此在一年以來，我們早有此類推斷，惜乎當世極少具有遠大眼光的政治家能為手揮五絃曰送飛鴻的做法，遂致釀成今日之局。等到中國大局動搖，大家才感覺東南亞的焦急，太平洋的風雲險惡，可脫是已幾近乎焦頭爛額了。</p>
<p>太平洋公約的醞釀，似有數月之久，至最近英國內閣特使李斯杜威爾訪問坎伯拉，與澳洲內閣共商太平洋防務，此項傳說仍益形具體化。澳洲國防部長台德曼也曾在議會中明自宣佈：「在英美澳三國發起之下，太平洋區各國業已開始進行討論，以期成立與大西洋公約類似的太不洋公約，用以防止共產主義的擴張而便復與工作得以順利進行」。惟因英國外務部堅持己見，非俟大西洋公約完成之後，不能開始談判太平洋公約，於是太平洋公約又告擱淺。現在，大西洋公約內容已經公佈，且定於四月西日在華府簽字，當可目為大西洋公約業已完成；以程序而論，太平洋公約自可開始進行談判了。何況太平洋各國受了大西洋公約的鼓勵吏加盼望太平洋公約能早日實現，看趨勢，太平洋公約的商訂，或有「水到渠成」才勢。據合眾社十九日華府訊，美國對於季里諾　流的建議頗感興趣，英方亦將表示贊同，展望外交上的活勸也就要正式開始了。</p>
<p>我們站在第三者的立塲，對於太平洋公約的締結，願提出幾項先決條件：第一，美國現所推行的重歐輕亞的政策，應即改絃易轍，迅速把她外交活動的重心從大西洋移到太平洋。但我們看到美國至今仍有希望英國在遠東方面多負一些責任之　，可知美國迄無改變其政策的傾向．如果美國不願在遠東方面居於領導地位，只知極力鼓吹太平洋公約，即使將來太平洋公約告成，其意議也將大打折扣，或且反而招致意外的惡果。第二，英國對於太平洋公約的看法，仍偏重在她東南亞自治領的安全，而沒有為整個亞洲打算的遠大計劃，尤其是她對於中共的態度，與其倡導太平洋公約企圖，司說是根本矛盾的。第三，中國是太平洋上唯一的安定力，任何性質的區域安全機構，不論是太平洋公約也好，東南亞聯盟也好，如果沒有中國參加在內，可預料其不食發生多大作用的。所以，英閏在亞洲方面的任何安排，必須先行設法穩定中國的局勢，勿使整個中國為中共一黨所統治而控制，從而使整個的亞洲大陸都陷於蘇聯的鐵慕之中。這個先決條件如不能實現，則其他的一切計劃都是徒然的。第四，印度總理尼赫魯對於太平洋公約似乎不十分熱心，而且巳有反對的表示，我們研究尼赫魯的用意，認為尼赫魯的意見，倒是十分值得英美兩國重視。須知今日的時代，已是亞洲世紀，決不可再以過去對待殖民地的眼光來看待亞洲各國，如果英美能以事實來證明尼赫魯的顧慮是多餘的，則印度巴基斯坦也將都他樂於參加太平洋公約的。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕重慶艦之被炸毀，其最致命之一彈，係十八日由機上聶炸員溫光欽所投。此彈使艦重傷，造成無法行動狀態。載該轟炸員執行任務之B-24機，係由楊湧濤少校駕駛。十九日前往執行任務之飛機稍多，所投各彈，率皆在艦上爆炸，最遠者距艦亦在五十公尺以內。此日楊湧濤之械，又由溫光欽投中致命一彈，炸中艦尾油庫，引起全艦火。十九日投彈，命中艦上者，另有黃飛達，王泰雲，李艦倫等所駕之飛機，而經由轟炸負王永熙，紀仁之手炸中艦面部份。此二組機上乘員及比六人，係經判明為造成殊勳之人物。在三天轟炸中，高射砲火，十八日及十九日均甚猛烈，砲彈高度且超越飛機之位置，致王鼎基所駕飛機，第三號發動機滑油管被彈片擊破，雖有礙飛行，但王鼎基仍駛返該機安全降落基地。餘如劉希瑞，侯遠等，三天皆前往轟炸，金治能，俞可盈，宋天信等飛行員，均沉著往返，達成任務，實為該機隊最成功的一次集團行動。此次炸重慶號之役，第九中隊B-25型機，亦曾飛往與炸。C-47空運機第一次往偵察時，曾受地面砲火猛擊，駕駛員江富考，王金篤，為葫蘆島上空景色所迷戀，其飛行幾低及重慶號方返。〔本報南京廿一日電〕此次重慶號背叛原因雖至複雜，然據熟悉海軍內幕人士告記者，其主因不外：（一）眾所週知，由於官兵待遇過低，該艦官兵在英實習時，與返國後之生活，判如天壤。（二）海軍內部官兵，素有馬尾系，北洋系，青島系之分，平日內部明爭暗門，至為激烈，在陳紹寬掌海總時，海單幾悉由馬尾系之閥人所包辦，自桂永清出任後，乃多方打破此地域觀念，因為閩系人士所不滿。此次重慶號之前任艦長鄧兆祥，卽隷馬尾系，而新任艦長（卹見習艦長）盧東閣（冀籍），則屬北洋系。當海總於發表盧繼鄧任重慶號艦長後，即為鄧及艦上一部馬尾系人物所不滿，故重慶號之出走，人事磨擦，應為其最主要因素。（三）截至現在止，關係方面所獲材料，知該艦於出走前，在艦上從事策動背叛之中共潛伏份子，共僅四五人，而此少數人所以能強制該艦北駛，據判斷，當係利用鄧艦長獲悉被調後，對海總之不滿情緒，鼓動鄧氏僑造命令，逕自北駛。蓋艦長乃一艦之最高負責人，所有命令，俱得無條件服從。又據關係方而告記者，新艦長盧東閣，過去於指揮一部海軍參與營口葫蘆島諸役時，頗著功動，海總於獲悉該艦巡自北駛，而並未駛向台灣時，猶認為或係鄧艦長將艦北駛，傳盧見習艦長「見習」。及後海總以　　無綫電命該鄧艦長南駛不從後，始悉已發生叛變情事。</p>

<p>— 鑣</p>
<p>無意地，今日的世界是美國和蘇聯所支配的世界，簡言之，為兩強世界。同時兩強缺演奏着截然不同的曲調；蘇聯已在歐亞兩州滲透其政治勢力，西歐民主集團國家在美國支持下亦正忙於抵制。此情此景，誰也不能不連想到聯合國的生命是否將在兩強角逐中而告壽終正寢，接着而起的是第三次世界大戰的爆發。</p>
<p>由於兩強中之任何一强，目前尚未具有控制整個世界的力量，蘇聯現正權利恢復戰時所蒙損失，因此決不輕易對民主國家引起正面衝突。人們雖深悉美國在軍備上超過任何國家，有原子彈和強大海陸軍，並有龐大工業力量做後盾，但至少在目前民主制度下，不致反抗民意而惹起慘烈大戰。</p>
<p>蘇聯領袖們對世界未來和平雖有不同意見，然有一堅定不變的觀點，認為資本主義本身即有一內在錯誤因素，因此蘇聯在原子彈未製就前，除等候機會外，忍耐等待資本主義末日的來臨。</p>
<p>但少數極端派認為兩種主義絕無共存之理，終究必至衝突。如待原子彈均已製就，在行牽入戰爭，不如早日聽其爆發，可以速戰速決，免致兵連禍結，民不堪命。顯然此種觀念是極端錯誤，其理由歸納之大約有三：</p>
<p>（一）近代戰爭僅恃優勢武器，並不致力操勝算，尚須握有大量訓練有素的軍隊和迅速動員為輔，始可達成人物。藎現代戰爭武器一進步，勝利之操持在與「閃擊」和「出奇」這兩項條件，持有原子彈之美國全付缺如。（二）如果美國一旦發動戰爭，勢必非求得最後勝利不可，而在現代戰爭慘酷過程中，無論敵友難免摧毀，結果無非使兩強變成一強，而此一強世界並非美國和蘇聯所希望，故發動第三次大戰實無意義。（三）苟吾人以原子彈威力，脅使敵人屈服，則在以後國際場合中，吾人決難使友邦在互信中和睦相處，以後之世界仍處於一互相猜疑之不安定狀態中。如一國會二度以原子彈獲勝，以後斷難以互信來贏取友邦，共維世界和平。</p>
<p>基於上項理由，以戰止戰，絕非求取和平之良策，除非兩國有特殊刺激性之事件，或一方有挑戰行為。吾人認為世界和平如措置得宜，仍可設法持久。如美國抱有一種觀念，即目前互相安靜姿態，僅係一時之休戰，時機一旦成熟，吾人將面臨一準備充足之強敵，如此則未來和平斷難持久。</p>
<p>目前問題是美國如單憑充實武力，企圖維持世界和平，那末，美國的備戰適足刺激蘇聯的備戰。美國有原子彈，蘇聯亦可研究及製造，如此無限止的擴張軍實，結果便有一場空前末有的慘烈大戰。在此大戰中，雙方競已最新式武器施諸對方，利用遠程飛機互相轟炸，使繁榮城市一瞬間華為廢墟，即使獲得勝利，而國力和文化斷非段時間所能恢復。於是戰爭後的列強，實際上尚不如未經參戰的落後國家，而不復為雄視全世之一等強國矣。</p>
<p>過去兩次大戰中，美國倖獲勝利之原因，不外下列兩種：（一）美國能順利將平時工業改為戰時工業；（二）利用西歐盟國作前衡及大西洋之距離，贏得充分時間以為動員準備。</p>
<p>但在今後原子戰爭中，欲獲得改變工業之時間已極困難，同事西歐列強已不復如前力能，使大洋之距隔不能作為安全之屏障。除非美國在戰爭爆發前，將戰時工業改裝就諸，美國之戰鬥力量預料將大不如前。在激烈戰爭過程中，如利用原子彈為武器，無論多寡，雙方生命及財產俱遭毀減，同歸於盡。</p>
<p>戰爭既非雙方之福，而和平又為舉世所希望。但欲贏得和平，必先使國際秩序趨於均衡。所謂趨於均衡，意既是蘇聯及西歐民主國家能得共存，而為共同利益努力，從而減少兩強衝突及仇視。</p>
<p>如世界上僅有美蘇兩國，則和平前途殊堪憂慮。蓋兩國相處，必難維持平衡，所幸這個世界除兩強之外，尚有掌握龐大資源及廣大人民之衆多獨立國，可為謀取集體安全之中間人。如此項中間人充實力量，可為維持世界和平之有力份子，造成國際均衡秩序。</p>
<p>如果居間人之衆多國家既弱又亂，則此既弱由亂的國家很容易淪為任何一强之衡星國，其後果將為世界均勢失去平衡，世界動亂乃至不可避免。反之，如居間國家政治能夠穩定，經濟能夠復興，不為任何一強所控制，則不僅兩強可以得到緩衝餘地，而世界和平亦可因此而持久。</p>
<p>贏得國際間的和平，不外有三（一）美國建立一強大無此的武力，強迫各國各守崗位，共維國際和平；（二）美蘇不經其他關係直接訂約，履行國際不干涉政策；（三）扶助居間國家建立一歐亞均衡制度，使不同主義並存於世，承認鬥爭之存在，除戰爭外軍用其他方法以解決兩國間爭端。</p>
<p>吾人認為第一項方法，除蓄心建立一強大武力外，並不能達到國際共存，徒然刺激另一強國之擴軍決心，以武力來維持和平，和平必不永久，故以武力求和平卻是夢想。</p>
<p>第二項美蘇單獨訂約，以不干涉姿態與其他友邦共處，果能實現，則世界和平自無問題，然以近情觀之，至少有下列兩項困難：（一）在目前情況下，美蘇雙方仍互相猜疑，在過去曾各持異見，資助居間各國的不同敵對政策。在此種情況下，即使訂約，還不是名存實亡，又有什麼用處？（二）兩強居間國家中仍多政治腐敗經濟紊亂者，而欲憑著自己革新，殆已無望，如坐視亂源滋長，終必影響世界和平。當此之時，外援自屬需要。如在美蘇不干涉條約下，若輩國家用淪貧弱而不能自拔，弱食放置強鄰之旁，終必發生戰爭，和平逐成泡影。</p>
<p>第三項方式為承認兩種制度之鬥爭的存在，而希望此中鬥爭以和平狀態下存在。此種和平式之鬥爭，既所謂「冷戰」是也。冷戰係包括政治及經濟上互施壓力，思想及心理之攻勢；一級其他如利用宣傳滲透等之策略，貫澈其優勢之目的。一般以為冷戰之所以危險，無非以為冷戰一久，可能惹起熱戰，但此實不可能。須知冷戰之起因，即由於冷戰發動者係避免熱戰之故。</p>
<p>大概冷戰發動者必有甚多目標，須待冷戰中獲得，但全視局勢而定。如彼在冷戰中發掘所遇之抵抗，出於意料之外，則於稍有收貨，既行停止。如進行較為順利，則必變本加厲，得寸進尺，求達更多更大的目標。</p>
<p>冷戰之較熱戰為佳者，非惟方式和平，然可能因稍得利益，一遇阻力既適可而止，而熱戰一旦發動，非至勝負分明，絕不能中途妥協。由於熱戰的慘酷，誰也不敢輕於嘗試，逐有和平式的冷戰。因兩強一件不同容或難免，所以冷戰亦無法消弭。在冷戰場合中，美國正運用其龐大經濟力量和實厚的資源，扶助居間國家之經濟復興，使之獨立繁榮，為世界持久和平的安定力可是美國的經濟力量，並非取之不盡用之不竭，同時居間國家總有龐大財力，亦不復為左右之力量，故如何有效地運用此龐大力量，即為美國和平式之冷戰戰略。冷戰戰略之成敗，即為世界和平之成敗。蘇聯現正運用其唯一之武器進行冷戰，既思想與主義是也。過去古蓮利用此種武器，滲入巴爾幹匈牙利希臘及近東等地，獲得廣泛的支持。</p>
<p>總之，為贏得居間國家的支持，必須勿強迫居间国家採用類似之政治及經濟制度，蓋所謂國際共存，必須建築在容納異見之上，使任何國家都有合乎自己國情的政府，和解決自己的民族命運。此外國際間思想交流，邦交增進，條約協議可以增進互相認識和諒解，使不同制度的國家仍可在和平環境中共存。（莭譯美國耶魯評論「和平戰略」一文）</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕小章，不知何許人也。同事淘裏祗曉得他世居南京，半年前才從南京一家嚴高學府裏捧了一張什麼經濟學學士的文憑出來。他叔叔在上海一家實力難厚的銀行裏當業務部副理，小章憑了這一點關係，就在他叔叔主管的部門裏，當起調查專員來。小章從來沒領會過同事淘裏那股海派氣息，看見問事披開正經公事不管，不談舞女的　勁，就探聽金鈔股票的行市，　忖「這批傢伙眞該死，硬是拿錢不辦公，我得做個榜樣給他們瞧瞧！」</p>
<p>但是一個月兩個月過去了，小章行裏混混，外邊跑跑，那股死硬的京朝派，終亽起了動搖。更何況靠生活指數拿來的那筆錢，能買到的東西一個月比一個月少。他想這年頭確該動動生意腦筯，憑我在學府裏學來的這一套經濟理論，以及各方面的接觸和交遊，還怕不能在生意塲中必操左券。主意打定，小章找人介紹了幾家投機金號，祗須繳二兩證金，可以做到十兩一大條的期貨交易。</p>
<p>得到消息　拋出兩條</p>
<p>這一晚，小章不知從什麼地方得到了千準萬確的消息，說是中央銀行為了收縮通貨，配合財金新方案的實施，決意連續大量拋售黃金·銀元·外匯移轉證·棉紗·食糖等等。他想，自財金新方案公布後，物價已經幾個翻身，看看已都到達了飽和點，而市場的銀根，已逼近七角關。根據貨幣數量學說，一般物價水凖是與通貨之數量及其流通速度成正比例，所以以後幾天中的金價走勢，必跌無欵。明天看準行市，拋空放拆，豈不上算。</p>
<p>第二天大清早，小章到寫字間簽了個到，就借着調查的名義溜出了行門，到了金號裏。離開盤還有十分鐘，可是非正式的金市仍在高檔盤旋。九時半行市開出，行市更上一級以三三五的高盤開出，小章得其所哉的拋出兩大條。卻砥抵押了在同事老馬那裏借來的四條小黃魚。拋空所得的六百七十萬元，就由金號裏替他以七角利息登帳。</p>
<p>金賤息高　兩面進賬</p>
<p>小章的理想沒落空，拋出的當天，金市起初還在高檔盤旋，而正當近午時刻，市場頭寸軋齊的當口，忽聞中央銀行透過某金號，向市場十條廿條的儘敲，行市在一刻鐘間，連小十餘檔，終以二百九十七萬元收盤。小童旗開得勝，好不欣慰，少不得在同事淘裏大次大擂一番，大家盛讚小章有「苗頭」。小章順水推舟說：「再看我兩夭苗頭！」</p>
<p>果眞不錯，以後的二天中，中央銀行除了在金市拋金外，拋紗·拋糖·拋外匯移轉證，數管齊下，一切行市都被壓得透不過氣來。銀根被收斂得空前奇緊，日拆已破一元關外。到了小章拋金的第四天，他想賺的該差不多了，決定補了吧，算算收穫，一天七角息，兩天一元一角息，再加高價拋出低價補進時的差額，共賺金圓二百卅餘萬，以當日三三〇的行市補進了黃金七兩還有幾萬金圓司摸。好個賺頭，怎不羨煞人也，看得同事淘裏個個眼紅。可是，小章仍蔚認為賺得不夠足裏足。因為他補進以後，行市接連二天還是盤檔，日拆亦始終屹立在七角八角之間。</p>
<p>這次以後，小章對投機金市的興趣和自信，驀地的加強了。他跟人說，第一次是小做做，別別小「苗頭」而已，好的做手還在後邊。果然，在之後的幾次多空做手中，小章幾乎是無往而不利，充其量不過是賺得足和賺不足的問題罷了。</p>
<p>又得消息　拋出十條</p>
<p>又一天，小章又不知在什麼消息靈通方面，得到了當局又要大拋特拋的綫索，看看銀根，也着賞鬆濫了有一陣了，祗要一有當局大拋的消息，那怕銀根不轉緊，日拆步高。這下主意打定，非一口氣拋他十條不行。</p>
<p>第二天清早，金市開盤三七五，日拆在六角光景，而金價在半小時內，因銀很續鬆，居然盤高至四關，還不拋更待何時。這下子小章決然毅然的拋空了十大條，當下付了兩大條的保證金。可是這次因銀很盤鬆，市塲又風傳當局有大筆匯款流出，銀根汎濫，日拆開得低，只有五角左右。</p>
<p>令價連跳　連本蝕光</p>
<p>小章逢人便說：這筆交易的「苗頭」在後邊，等着瞧吧，他準備挺上三天。第一天上午金價出了四關不說，下午隔天交易又高至四五〇以上。第二天當局乃無拋售任阿東西的音訊，而外埠匯款卻續有流到，銀根仍鬆，日拆江河日下，祇剩四角半，金價則更上一級至四八〇，第三天，走勢依然，小章有心硬挺到底，冷不防第四天當局忽有一大筆冰蛋結款數十億流出來，市場銀根全而汛濫，金價直破五關，竄至五三五萬元。一向自信的小章，竟至面無人色，以往幾次收獲算算全部吐出之外還要虧損五六兩之多繳在金號裏的二大條證金，此時已僅存一二兩左右，金號老閩是勢利的，看看小章證金已不足規定，除追繳外，還勸小章趁早補進，軋平了吧！小章在此四面楚歌的情況下，最後惟有忍痛一結。</p>
<p>發財幻景消失　宣誓不再投機</p>

<p>〔本報無錫廿日訊〕轟動無錫之「情殺案」兇犯張際明，經稽查隊在滬捕獲，解送城防指揮部後，迭經軍法室審訊，以罪證確屬，依法判處死刑，呈經第一區綏蜻區司令部，轉呈京滬杭警備總司令部核示去後，施即奉令尙須重行補傳證人複審，十九日下午，城防部軍法室遵即粟傳證人張玉事·張小黑·徐阿榮·陳程氏·張錦祥·及大華醫院院長吳文華，宏恩醫院院長李中唐等，到案訊問，由軍法官陳詩民開庭。</p>
<p>臨死高喊際明殺人</p>
<p>據張玉亭供，五十歲，河北人，業唱戲，住中東戲院，係被害人趙罄聲張玉燕夫婦之義父，出事時，我已入睡，突聞槍聲劈拍，經人叫醒，待穿衣下狀時，罄聲突手按右腰，匐伏進房，口嚷「爸爸，張際明打我啦」，說完即伏地，後進王燕房間，她早被打死在牀上，因聽說際明有槍，所以未敢追捕，即將傷人先送宏恩醫院，一面報吿稽查隊，事前際明曾有恐嚇信給我，繼據張小黑供，十四歲，唱戲，與玉燕罄聲同住一房，他們二人同睡一牀，我睡在桌子底下，出事時我在睡夢中聽見玉燕喊叫「爸，張際明打我啦」，我頓時驚醒，抬頭一看，見張際明拿着白亮的手槍，對着姊姊玉燕，，第二聲喊叫時，已不像人喊，好似鬼號，嚇得我不敢再看，後又聽見打槍，際明就逃走了，並指着庭上獲案之手槍稱，就是這枝手槍，繼訊陳程氏，氏係玉亭妻妹，亦住東新旅社，所供與玉亭小黑兩人相同。</p>
<p>行兇情形　茶房目覩</p>
<p>又據大華醫院院長吳文華供稱，和張際明並不認識，趙罄聲是三十八年一月廿五日六時送院救治，人是在宏恩醫院治過後送來，進院時未掛號，就送開刀房，問他時，他說是槍打的，包紮完畢後，再問他，當時趙之神態極爲憤恨，「咬牙喊張小子，，復據宏恩醫院院長李中唐供稱，張玉亭在夜間四時餘，用人力車送趙罄聲來院救治時，趙說：「爸爸你快去提張際明」，我檢查他，他兩大腿中兩槍，肚子上一槍，腿上四個洞，我斷定是曾打二一槍，嗣據徐阿榮供，徐爲東新旅社茶房，他說，並不認識張際明，今天來做證人，一定說實話，趙張二伶人，住東新十二號房間，他們二人被打死情形都知道，即將張際明如何於深夜戒嚴時間進門，如何面貌，穿何衣服，肇禍後如何出門，最後並堅稱，就是用案上之手槍打死二伶人的</p>
<p>三次指認　難圖狡賴</p>
<p>證人中之一張錦祥，係兇犯張際明所提出，據供，四十歲，廣東人，住南京，開戲院，和際明是朋友，陰歷十二月間，在公餘聯歡社曾見一面，當時他並對衆人說：「文化劇團要邀京角，我可去滬設法」，以後就聽說他打死人，從此和他未曾見面，最後陳軍法官簽提兇手張際明到庭，據供湖南醴陵人，首都衛戍司令部少校政工隊長，張王燕在劇團裏認識，和她曾有肉體關係，她要嫁我，我不敢要，僅和趙罄聲見過一次面，我並未打死他，一月廿六日我由京至滬，廿七日就到警備部去看張處長，要求調工作，一面在滬邀角，廿六日出事時，我本人係去上海，最後庭上復傳在塲目覩之張小黑徐阿榮，經陳軍法官連續訊問指證三次，故本案主犯，必係張際明無疑，現該部已將複審情形，呈報第一綏蜻區司令部核示，衆認該『風流車官』，終難逃一死。</p>

<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十九日訊〕杭州的春天是像一幅圖畫，湖光山色的綺麗，參雜着紅男綠女的遊客，尤其那穿着靑布襖背着黄布袋朝山進香的農胞們，她們成羣結隊，走過堤邊岸畔，把她們的影子倒映在湖中，該是多麼的詩情畫意啊！雖然我們站在欣賞的立塲，來看這恬淡安適的天堂春景，但我們進一步滲透畫中人的心情，那裏當也有不少苦辣辛酸的家常。那農胞們，他們來杭州並不是遊山玩水，而是眞正虔誠的燒香拜佛，求取這一年的幸福。所以在江南的農村中，只要一提起赴杭州佛地燒香，莫不摒擋一切勉力以赴的。在承平年間爲了人口太平，爲了蠶花茂盛，爲了收成豐實，沒有一家農家，不推出一二個人到杭州來進香的。今年的情况顯然不同了。松木塲的船隻沒有往年的多，堤邊岸畔僅有三三兩兩背着黄布袋的人。我曾問過幾位老太太，她們吿訴我的確使我們感到辛酸的。</p>
<p>去年收成並不太好，而催糧催兵的命令却異常緊急，糧從田裏收起，打成穀子，挑到鎭上還賦，把秤的人不是說穀子濕了不收，便是把小秤變成大秤，分量不足，還得去拿來補償，從鄕鎭到田間，要一天的路，搖船的人工飯食，都得要自己料理·有些人免得麻煩，只要孝敬孝敬收糧的人，也就可以馬虎過去，你看那收糧爺們的面色，此城隍山守在頭山門口的菩薩還兇！兵，有錢有勢的，一家有五六個壯丁都不得事，像窮困的人家即使是靠着生活的獨子也要抽了去，哀求甲長，甲長說這是公事，哀求保長，保長說這是上頭的命令，苦苦的懇情下總算答應了，但是必得出壯了安家費二三擔穀子不算一回事。</p>
<p>農貸合作她們全不知道，春耕時節，還不是向有勢的人家去借點來維持，有幾次，說是鎭上的官爺們奉到縣裏官爺們的命令來調查視察，大魚大肉要請他們吃，抹抹嘴去了，餘下來一筆賑要攤在貧窮無勢人的身上。</p>
<p>她們的房屋還是祖先蓋起來的，現在也沒有能力再添新居，豬檻內的大猪小猪漸漸的少了，耕田用的水車，犁，鋤頭都已舊了，老牛也已衰弱了，她們唯一的歸咎就是命運中注定，只有虔誠的相信菩薩，方可來生投胎做個鎭上的官爺，或是發大財的人，造起高大的房屋，添起新的家具，猪檻內的豬滿滿的，再不要自己下田去種地，可以安間地享享淸福。過過好的生活。這也就是進香的唯一玄想了。今年家裏藏的米，都光了，進香的香頭到處約人來杭州燒香，但是每人要七斗米，七斗米，在出產糧食的農家，倒不是一個小的數字，加之，出了米去進香，回來又不知怎樣生活，並且聽說時勢不好，所以這回來杭州進香的人沒有此往年多了。</p>
<p>基於以上這許多老太太們的訴說，我們已可了然於我們的農村是在如何的一種情况下？城市中的人們，一切都取之於農村，農村呢？祗有付與，沒有收入，更談不到留給鄕村一些好處，在層層的剝削下，使我們的農村，成了極度的貧血，極度的衰頹，極度的癱瘓。農村，在層層的困縛下，他們的想法也是至爲落後的，他們還是十九世紀的想法，想做官與發財，他們還企求菩薩給予安慰，給予幸福，給予快樂！</p>
<p>農村教育自是不能再緩了，給予他們新的生產技能，給予他們新的智識，給予他們新的農具，給予他們新的方法！</p>
<p>中國到底還是農業的國家，我們的眞正主人沉默不言埋頭忍苦了這末多年，他們快要因癱瘓而瀕於絕境，眞是覆巢之下，焉有完卵，我們要改良一切施政的方法。</p>
<p>春天，在西子湖靜靜地恬淡的氣筑下，許多詩情畫意讓騷人墨客來吟詠執筆，以上這許多事實，當也會引爲這是現實的最好資料吧。</p>

<p>對趁火打刧及地主趕走方式表示反抗</p>
<p>編輯先生：我們是一羣流亡來滬的難民，在二年前因受不了內戰砲火的威脅，相偕來滬，慘談經營，在麗園路上建築些草棚板房以蔽風雨，一家數口，黄口白髮，靠着勞工苦力以維持，平日生活，已足够苦楚的了。不意於本月五日，又發生了火災，我們三百多家棚戶，盡皆付諸一炬。事情是這樣的：那天下午二時許，先是一家棚戶因爐火失愼，延燒起來，當即通知滬南區消防隊前來灌救，但是，麗園路一帶，向無太平龍頭設備，消防人負雖敏捷工作，唯以接水太遠，時又風伯助威，待水通到灌救，火勢已燃燒得很猛烈了。救熄後，我們三百多家已無一幸免，在火災發生時，我們因生活驅使，都在外面工作，不及趕返，所以對於一些家私什物，雖經婦女們搶出少數，但是，竟被一般歹徒，乘火打劫去了。方今我們正在收拾餘燼，但是又有一個足够使我們痛心的消息來了——地主們用各種方式，藉想收回產權，趕我們動身，試問巨刧後的我們，何有餘力另行他遷？我們喊天無救，入地無門，素仰貴報爲民喉舌，爰特借貴報一角，予以披露，祈政府當局，社會人士，予以正義聲援。此頌撰安麗園路全體災民叩上　三月十日　災民代表王鴻飛，徐永年，夏國雲，張洽祥，證明事實者：蓬萊區七二保保長施守動（印）</p>

<p>— 本報記者者　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港十八日航訊〕香港商塲中最近發生了兩種驚人事件：一間經營香港與暹羅貿易的大辦莊，宣佈倒閉，拖欠貨款二百萬元以上。一間頗有規模的織布廠，也因負債廿多萬元而被法院查封，敏感的商人早已喊出「不景氣」那句口頭禪，但就當前香港的情形來看，「淡風已吹到香港」，確是不折不扣的事實。</p>
<p>據港中某大英商銀行的負責人最近表示，當前香港的金融業已面臨四十年來未有的蕭條量象，目前各大銀行的業務，已比去年全盛時期退縮百分之三十以上。本港中外銀行有鑒於不景氣的陰影，現已採取種種緊急步驟，最顯著的有二：提高押匯按金。太港的進口貨物，現已大大超過其實際銷塲的需要量，因此貨價低跌，甚至有跌至低過其押匯按金的此率；商行支持不了，銀行也受損失。所有外商銀行最近已把押匯按金由百份之廿五，提高至百份之五十以上。對信用薄弱的進出口商，更給予種種限制。銀行爲了保障本身的利益，益增加商人的困難。（二）降低按揭貸款並停止所有帶危險性的放款。本年一月間，一般產業押貸，尙可及原値百份之六十，最近已降至百份之五十以下，最低達到百份之三十。銀行方面似已恐懼本港目前實在過高的產業價値，未來將有驚人低跌的可能。貨物按揭此數，也大大抑低。「冷門」貨物甚至拒絕押貸。聽說有若干英商銀行，已奉倫敦總行命令避免押入過多的有價證券和股票，而已到期的，則限令依期淸償，不允展期，此舉已引起股票市價普遍的跌落。</p>
<p>由於進出口貿易的退縮和銀行信用的緊縮，香港商人現已感受極大的壓力，支持不住的祇有關門大吉，而上述兩種倒閉案，就是顯著的例子。據經濟界調查，今年首季內，香港對華貿易已降至戰後的最低度。最近粵省當局在水陸交通棧上嚴厲對付小規模走私的「水客」，致令港中一般零售商的生意也大打折扣，反映在市面的，茶樓酒肆舞堪一片冷落，「大减價「的彩旗又插滿了街頭」香港對南洋的貿易，因爲日貨的競爭，也呈空前的退縮，而織造業尤首當其衝。</p>
<p>根據遠東經濟評論報所載，港中織布廠計有三百二十二家，倒閉的已有一百三十二家。現存一百九十家當中，開工的僅有九十家。其他橋瓷業，膠鞋業，電手筒業，風燈業等，也感銷塲日窄，危機四伏。當前港商對華北，對朝鮮，對台灣，對歐洲等新市塲的期待，只可解釋爲在困苦的環境下一個「另尋出路」的企圖。</p>
<p>但在淡風正夾在薰風中吹蕩香港市塲的當兒，港府提出了一個有史以來最大的下年度預算案，計達一八〇·〇一九·三七〇港元之鉅（比本年度增加三一·〇一四·三六三元），平均每個居民約負担一百兀。根據這個龐大的預算，港府（至少在目前）是不承認香港已陷入不景氣中。港府預算下年度的收入中，祗是直接稅，烟酒化粧品稅和飲食，馬票舞堪娛樂稅三大項，便已超過半數（共計九五·七七五·〇〇〇元）。可見港府的意料，在未來的一年內，香港的市面還是相當繁榮的。</p>
<p>本年度收支對比，港府財政盈餘了二千四百萬元。加上前兩年的盈餘數字，港庫盈餘數字已有六千萬元。據港府財政司霍勞士報吿，「他認爲這個數字未足使到本港渡過其營養不足的時期。」他主張本港建立龐大準備金，以應付不時之需，所謂「不時之需」，未知是否爲「不景氣時期」的暗示？</p>
<p>港府解釋下年度預算的增加，極力强調本港安全問題，故要求支出大量行政費，以擴充警察實力及建立香港防衛軍。財務司說：「預算案的中心，在於安全。」據稱，直接或間接用於安全方面者，將達二千六百萬元之數。港府最高當局也有「準備最壞的希望最好的」的聲明，同是生活在一個小島上，老百姓所顧慮的是不景氣的侵擊，官方所顧慮的却是安全問題。這是够耐人尋朱的！</p>
<h3 id="c106">江西棉產 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>

<p>本從外域入中原，聖賦金聲實源，</p>
<p>兩足淸明方佈種，功資耕織煥黎元。</p>
<p>——乾隆題保定耕織圖——</p>
<p>江西棉產，常年的產額，不過五六百萬斤，如以現有人口一千二百萬，每人每年須用棉花一斤做爲衣被塡充料計算，現有的棉產，尙不足需用量的半數，所以江西每年棉織品的輸入，是超過糧食出口總値，我們到農村放眼看去，有幾人衣能遮體，而不現褸襤百結的窮像！</p>
<p>江西紡織工業，現在是在萌芽時期，九江興中紗廠，有紗錠二萬，南昌有新甡紗廠現有紗錠二千，短期內可能再增加三千錠，二廠年需細絨原棉，約五萬擔，有百分之九十以上皆仰賴漢口，安慶供給，而鄱湖沿岸冲積層的彭澤一帶，所產的綠籽美棉，供應紡織工業者，僅佔百分之十，鄕間衣被塡充料的棉花，除一部份取自省產外，大多數亦由鄂南的黄梅武穴以及湘省的洞庭湖區輸入，另外由京滬輸入的棉織品，當然亦代替了一部份的用棉。</p>
<p>農林部棉產改進處，爲統籌全國棉花增產</p>
<p>現將江西列爲棉產自給省之一，所以江西棉花的增產，是贛省經建事業中的一個大課題，最近兩年來棉產推廣工作，經贛北植棉指導處的努力，已收相當成效，去年在永修彭澤等地的植棉，雖然遭到十餘年來所未有的大水，影響棉收，但是，棉農對優良棉種——岱字棉——的使用與信心，却是提高了，今後江西的棉產，將進入到增產的境地，達成自給的目的。</p>
<p>贛北棉塲在彭澤拓荒開墾與試騐的結果：</p>
<p>美棉區域試驗</p>
<p>包括昔國先後引進的主要美棉品種，暨國內各農事機關選育的品種，以及贛北區本地栽培的退化美棉品種共十八種，試騐結果總平均籽棉產量爲每市畝（一六五·六）市斤，各品種產量以涇斯棉（二〇七·四）市斤爲最高，D.P.L一四（一九一·四）市斤，次之，遂寗七五號（一八八·七）市斤列第三位，華農二號（一八五）市斤，列第四位，岱字棉彭澤推廣種，以（一七八·八）市斤列第五位，彭澤退化美棉Ｄ五三一，及FOSTER，六三品種，依次以每畝（一四四·八）市斤，（一四六·一）市斤，（一四七·四）市斤列倒數第一二三位，而岱字棉衣分特高，成熟期亦較德字棉略早，實爲當前堪資推廣之品種，至涇斯棉與遂寗七五號的早熟豐產，生長整齊，衣分中上，尤爲値得注意的品種，且涇斯棉原係適應黄河流域棉區的斯字棉系統中育成，今竟亦適應於長江下游的棉區，而表現優越的成績，據主持江西棉花增產的人士表示，此一試騐，甚堪研究，而爲甚有趣味的結果。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華股市況，昨日走勢先堅後疲，市上銀根仍鬆，業內暗息回低，初因金鈔市況平疲，業外游資歸來，買氣驟旺，市勢堅盤於前半程。嗣聞央行拋售金銀未見動靜，金鈔市勢挺升，股市人心又趨淡薄，圈中游資入而復出，抬面賣氣轉盛，空方頻施壓力，人心見軟，午收仍以低價結束。</p>

<p>十二年來，金銀交易，幾從未完全停止過一天，所以今天金銀市場的開業，只表示着：（一）黑市變為明市；（二）非法的變為合洗；（三）散在的無組織的，變成集中的有組織的。</p>
<p>這三種意義，可以說是最近財金當局一切措施上的統一精神，也可以說是非常孔孟化的。</p>
<p>冉求問孔老夫子曰：「何謂惠而不費」？</p>
<p>孔老夫子說道：「因民之所利而利之，斯不亦惠而不費乎」？</p>
<p>這就是說：人民認為利的，政府就應該放任他們。人民利了，政府也利了，豈非惠而不費乎？</p>
<p>當今財金當局，深得孔學三昧，地下錢莊，黑市利息，人之所利也；政府故而開放他。金鈔交易，黑市很忙，人民之所利也；政府故也開放他。諸如此類，無一非孔孟哲學之實行，誰曰不宜也！</p>
<p>金銀交易，由非法而合法了；由散在而集中了，此後常有一番遠景。</p>
<p>這還景到什麼程度？首先要明白三百六十行，行行都趨向着利潤的均衡，從道一點來考察，金銀市場今後的進退，最可能把股市救了回來。</p>
<p>過去一週的股市，又謂交了黑運，從今天起，不難互相提攜，此拉彼唱。</p>
<p>或謂：過去有紗布等市塲，股市原非吾道不孤也。然則在實銷尚暢時，紗布確有協進股市之功。週來情勢稍變，而且紗布下本又大，金銀交易以一兩為單位，輕而易舉。故與股市攜平，殊較紗布等為便利</p>
<p>金銀市場和股市提攜，最現成的，該是金債券了。</p>
<p>金債券上市迄今，落魄迄今，今而後，金債券一天套做，可能之實行了。</p>
<p>金債券的一天套做，在當局可有二個念頭：（一）推銷有方了；（二）控制金銀市場，也有一個小辮子司拉住了。</p>
<p>不信，且看今後一二週的新變化罷：（一）金價券，可能代替洩了氣的外匯移轉證，作為拋拋抽抽的工具了。（二）五角錢日拆的底盤，司能在金債券的一天套做中，產生一個「公式」化的市塲利率，來調節一番了。</p>
<p>這些，明眼人不必多說了。</p>
<p>現在，小百姓關心的，是物價和銀元價金銀市場開業將隨而發生何種作用呢？首光，當然是水漲船高，其次，馬路的誤元價格，不致豁得太開。　金債券起作用股市前途轉機</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕今晚籃球聯簧，秩序略有雙更，因美海軍陸戰隊及美艦培斐爾奉令調防，將於本月底離滬，故麥令斯及培斐爾二隊請求將聯賽未了比賽，提前舉行，籃球委員會巳准其所請，除將甲一組所有朱賽秩序，全部重排外，今晚原有甲一組滬警對海青一塲，改為麥令斯對恩卡斯，仁餘對回力一塲照舊。麥令斯球藝突飛猛晉，恩卡斯為西青勁旅，兩隊硬碰硬，功力匹敵，大有可觀。仁餘朝氣蓬勃，回力亦為快速部隊，眞所謂旗鼓相當，難言勝負，門券樓上五百元，樓下一千元，對號一千五百元，秩序如下：</p>
<p>美氣象—培爾（甲二C）五時半　裁判　黃有瑞　問宗元</p>
<p>麥令斯—恩卡斯（甲一補）六時半　栽判　金怕陶　劉荷生</p>
<p>仁餘—回力（甲一組）七時半　裁判　王立鐸　吳詩鑑</p>
<p>甲二C部首先交綏，美氣象逢培爾，番兵在該部中三戰三勝，奪標呼聲最高，雖隊長泊透昇格轉入甲一組恩卡斯，然實力依然強勁。培爾三仗，二勝一負，陣容相當整齊，有沈被章。吳詩鑑。俞爾稼及胡氏昆仲等俱是個中名手，屆時與美氣象當有惡戰。甲一組麥令斯與恩卡斯重逢，此係第二循環補賽，此戰原定前週舉行，嗣兩隊以參加海軍青年會拳擊決賽，同時請救改期者也。麥恩兩隊同屬番兵勁旅，初循相逢，麥隊受挫，者番再度相值，麥隊當全力上塲，以圖報復。惟恩卡斯麾下如部利勃脫，格朋乞谷夫都係能征慣戰，且自泊透助陣後，如虎添翼，益見　悍，故二循中得運破滬警及回力，麥令斯能否逃過刼運，且待塞戰結果如何也。</p>
<p>壓軸仁餘重遇回力，仁餘近況彌佳，鬥志尤為堅強，於二循之中將恩卡斯麥令斯海青三路番兵殺得片甲不留，氣燄高張，不可一世，除華聯外，具攫取王座希望者僅此一隊而已，因是三軍益見精神抖擻，雄心勃勃，惟吳新運傷足能否出場成問題，在實力上不免稍受影響，回力自葉陳歸來，益收牧丹綠葉相得益彰之效，以其「快速」作風時有驚險緊張之演出，永芳福海志吉三劍客均能獲分，魏戍近況尤佳，今為爭取勝利，並雪首循三恥，勢必全力上塲與仁餘一決雌雄也。</p>

<p>〔香港航訊〕上星期六香港足球聯賽，共有三塲，先看結果：</p>
<p>南華南勝東方會　三比〇</p>
<p>傑志會勝聖約瑟　四比一</p>
<p>巴士隊勝光華會　七比二</p>
<p>東方借將　難免鴨蛋</p>
<p>這場「東南」大戰的結果，給我們看出的：（一）東方不惜從澳門調來三員蔔籍名將，和一負勇悍善戰的盧漢臣來加強陣容顯然有一敗「畏勝軍」的野心，最低限度，對此戰是十分重視的。（二）東方戰鬥力顯然加倍強大了，戰意也相當旺盛，且全軍都有水準上的演出，麥錫高的攻守得宜，盧漢臣的瞻前顧後，梁定棠，雖在手傷尚未十分痊愈時期，仍然穩健如昔，都是「可圈可點」的；祇惜葡將與奮將平時絕少合作，所以聯絡未見純熟，屢屢失機。由此可以見到，球賽的勝負雖然要重視們人的技術，但全隊的聯絡及戰略運用的成功與否，也是不能忽視的。（三）東方這塲雖然敗了，但給予觀眾的評價卻高，祇是遭逢南華南全軍也拼力週旋，毫不放鬆，達到水準上的演出，所以不能不敗，看南華守衛前鋒的一氣呵成，好像水銀瀉地，無孔不入，馮二叔的指揮若定，朱永強的活動，在在都是東方後防的致命威脅；而榕生，金海，錦洪，松生的運環包抄，形成一度不可破的金城湯池，使缺乏默契合作的東方前鋒，有寸步難行之感，余耀德兩救險球，更令東方不能打破光蛋，三比〇的結局，實在是技術的成就，不是倖勝的了。</p>
<p>南華南</p>
<p>余耀德　張樹陵　侯榕生　劉松生　謝錦洪　張金海　謝錦河　田協波　朱永強　馮景祥　費春華</p>
<p>東方會</p>
<p>梁定棠　林德譜　江善敬　黎其廣　盧漢臣　陳利　李殿祺　劉福銓　嘉華露　麥錫高　李洪祺</p>
<p>光華小將　先盛後衰</p>
<p>巴士是日演出未達理想，上半場憑順風之利，圍攻達十分鐘，仍夫能打開紀錄，迨被光華諸小將逆風行軍打入一只後，始見巴士士氣振奮，大輝復與春發易位，情況大見好轉，一鼓攻勢，連陷數城，始奠下勝基。</p>
<p>巴士隊</p>
<p>孫實安　譚振輝　麥林福　馮坤勝　孔慶煜　鄧森　李大輝　譚煥章　鄧宜杰　鄒文治　李春發</p>
<p>光華會</p>
<p>譚煥焯　梁柏偉　梁鷗富　伍球廣　鄧汝齊　黃子雲　羅德興　郭文添　劉偉民　羅福松　羅德福</p>
<p>風伯主宰　傑志奏捷</p>
<p>傑志迎戰約瑟，因海風狂吹，雙方均賴之以為獲分的優越條件，上半塲約瑟藉風伯之助以一比零佔先，傑志則以四比零在下半場反敗為勝。</p>
<p>全場比賽即以風神的作祟，劃成兩個階段，也就是說，僅僅是兩個半場的攻守戰而巳。道裏賬見得傑志的一守一攻，平均都較約瑟來得高明一第，上半時在守勢中能步步為營，勉力掙扎，僅負一球，卻替全隊奠下了一個可實貴的基礎，下半塲才得展開全面攻勢。約瑟在絕少反攻聲中，同時因守將的技低一着，終於給郭英祺，姚卓然，予取予求，竟然以四比一的絕大比數克服之。</p>
<p>傑志會</p>

<p>〔香港廿一日航訊〕華聯對西聯之督憲杯賽，開賽時是西聯先取得攻勢，但僅如曇花一現，卽被華聯屢屢攻入。但那時識者早已看出大輝大失水準，他屢次三番，俱是盤近底綫，欲傳中反將球誤踢出界外，第三次欲傳中時，卻因羅差力抵，竟微傷厭足，這或是昨日他全場俱無甚好演出的原因，亦未可定，但看他以後的跑法，則似所傷不重，可是他昨日卻始終下能演出以前的威人</p>
<p>在最初五分鐘之內，華聯雖然攻多守少，但曾被西聯迫成一次角球，八分鐘時，美吾因盲目衝門，竟在靚德抱球在手時，與擠個滿懷，雖然他自己已撞破頭頗，須於離場上膠布止血，仍得被罰自由球，由是可知那人的閱歷本有限，不過恃勇恃快，昨日又適如有幸運之神降監其身，故被幸運地射進兩球罷了，我是看下出他有甚麼超綽之處</p>
<p>美吾逞能</p>
<p>十分鐘時，基亞能曾猛然射中一記，靚德雖救脫大險，卻運續再失兩次角球，一次朱仔在左方吊門具高，一次李大輝突人中央，在廿五碼外怒射中鵠，卻被晏打臣擋成角球，約十五分鐘時，武倫會越付傳中，被侯律衝入一記，武倫越位在先，自不能作算，基亞能忽走左翼位置盤球直上，近底綫橫傳一腳，球在門前橫過時，卻有西維亞接應，急足再傳門前，那時有美吾改走中央空位，剛巧球到人到，由是近門射入，先拔頭籌。</p>
<p>華聯在失此球後，卽使春發與朱永強易位，未幾大輝得機射門，卻又被晏打臣擋成角球，球到文治交春發命射，竟成高射砲，卅六分鐘時，美吾盤球深入，侯榕生力抵，已緾近底綫，那時榕生原欲將球踢彈於美吾腳上，使反彈出界外自踢門球，不道球雖彈中美吾，卻斜滾不逾界，美吾乘機起腳橫　，竟如有神助，射出之球不偏不倚，竟斜彈入華聯門內，球是貼右柱斜飛入網，因角度斜，其來也疾，靚德欲救無從，華聯又輸第二記</p>
<p>華聯變陣</p>
<p>舉聯自知守衞有弱點，急使謝錦洪改當正中衛，由繆仔改東左後衛，更由張金海出前綫領軍進攻，李春發改打左中衛，但因頹勢已成，一時無法平反敗局，至四十二分鐘時，在俟律侵入腹地，橫衝直撞之中，有謝錦洪侯榕生協力向彼糾緾，合力夾其人在中央，以至滾作一團，同倒於地上，球證於是判罰華聯十二碼罰球，球由武倫主踢，因發腳太偏，只中門右柱未人，於是上半時，華聯只負二球，亦算不幸中之幸。</p>
<p>下半時再開賽，西聨陣容一仍舊貫，華聯則另佈成如下陣容︰</p>
<p>余耀德　繆暢榮　侯榕生　劉松生　謝錦洪　李春發　李大輝　鄒文治　張金海　馮景祥　朱永強</p>
<p>此時華聯卽調整陣容，顯見實力此上半塲為優，但見一輪急攻復一輪，賽僅兩分鍗，卽有李大輝怒射中門，晏打臣將球抱住時，張金海已衝至，晏恐有失，卽拍球閃避，然張亦力追，以身障其前，使無法將球踢出，奇歷乞見此，突然目中爆火，竟衝向張背後力撞，張雖倒地，然十二碼罰球已成，此球仍由拚命三郎」充劊子手，一刀見而，華聨遂追回一對二局面。</p>
<p>反勝失機</p>
<p>自得回甜頭，華聯聲威猶見煊赫，一次朱永強吊中，華軍羣向門前進製，但卒被晏打臣推出，可是華聯斯時聲威太盛，至十五分鐘時，有馮景祥妙射建功，遂打成二對二平手，一時觀者歡聲雷動，以為華聨有此，則勝利可期了。</p>
<p>不道再賽三分鐘，卽有西維亞在邊陲得機怒進，繆暢榮雖與賽跑苦纏，無如佔位未得其法，仍被切入認門撇射一腳，球出甚疾，靚德雖探手觸及來球，仍被滑入網內，於是西聯再度領前。此後則有張金海足部受傷，巳失卻衝門之力，由是華聯遂無怯再取勝利。此後猶有兩事足紀的，厥為卅一分鐘時陽爆皮球，及一次侯子遠出吊門，張金海雖足傷仍勉力衝上，威脅得晏打臣只能離門向前，匆忙將球推出，球為馮二叔所獲，立吊空門，可惜去勢略差，不直墜入門內而墜在網項，不然則此記可有反敗為勝之可能，因加時再賽，華聯未必不能終打得勝鼓，殊可惜也。</p>

<p>〔香港廿一日航訊〕本年的督憲盃，昨日已被幾位華人球員，在莫名其妙的演出中，冤枉地斷送與足球總會的西聯隊去了。雖則本季的特別銀牌，已被華隊包辦了決賽權，聯賽的冠軍和亞單獎，俱不啻已穩屬華人，紀念盃也是為吾人听得，但以如許人才的協會華聯隊，竟喪失了督憲盃，眞不祗是美中不足，旣有過第一次以一此六大敗於人，昨日又再輸個尾陣，直可以謂之奇恥大辱。</p>
<p>論我們昨日的陣容，計有國腳八雙，在香港，巳是強絕一時的組織了，何況對方人馬，無論是逐個比較，抑或全隊論技，全都不是我們一眾英雄可比，則我們那有失威的理由，然而在賽去廿三分鐘時，基亞能一下賣弄乖巧，突由左翼位置盤球而上，便搗亂了我方守衛者的步驟，竟被他從容向門前橫傳，而終於被改走中央的美吾拔幟先登了，又在上半塲賽去三十六分鐘時，那最能爽脆地大腳勾銷的侯子，竟如三十老娘倒繃孩兒，在底綫面對着正向他作極端威脅的美吾，猶自在玩弄花巧，結果在那人神出鬼沒的一射中，又失去一關，其後雖然在下半場，在諸將發奮之中，於十五分鐘內，卽已追回二對二平手，不道繆暢榮終輸經騐，那時是西維亞得球疾進，小繆巳猛走猛纏，壓住了陣腳，不道因取位未得其法，仍被西維亞一下撇射，居然中門再獲勝利，於是被人家施施然在港督葛量洪爵士手中，喜氣洋溢地把督憲盃捧走，這眞是有點令中國球迷透不過氣來的一回事。</p>
<p>協會華聨</p>
<p>謝錦洪（南南）　余耀德（南南）　侯榨生（南南）　劉松生（南也）　繆暢榮（中華）　張金海（南南）　李大輝（巴士）　鄒文治（巴士）　朱永強（南南）　李春發（巴士）　馮景祥（南南）</p>
<p>總會西聯</p>
<p>多沙（海軍）晏打臣（陸軍）　羅差（約瑟）　奇歷乞（陸軍）　李安納（約瑟）　羅便臣（陸軍）　美吾（香港）　基亞能（香港）　侯律（警察）　武倫（香港）　西維亞（約瑟）</p>
<p>繆暢榮是個少見過大塲的後起青年，在如此塲合中演不出水準，并不是奇事，最奇的是本港的最好的兩名中衛，前日賽束方時，還自如生龍活虎，可是咋日竟完全走了樣，謝錦洪這次回當左後衛，也不覓得能似在南南常正中衛佳，最可惜的是李大輝太走樣，不獨全沒了切入射門腳頭，便速傳中的力度也不像樣了，我相信是他平時太愛玩小型足殊之故，我常說路小型球，只可作為練習大足球的入門路徑，在大足球圈賽一玩好了，便不應再從事於小型球，不然則會有損無益，原因是小型球和大足球的重量不同，球場大小也不同，踢時施用的力度有異，大足球員分心於小型球，是會令大足球技衞退化的，我鑒於昨日大輝傳中力度的「到喉不到肺」，我敢於認定他是自誤於多賽小型球。</p>
<p>我這坦率之言，自然是春秋責備賢者的方法，這是愛之深，不覺言之切，若在大處着筆，則華聯雖不幸輸了，但有過下半塲的奮鬥精神，和一見事似不濟，卽立行變更陣容的急智，也是值得讀美的。馮老景老當益壯，打來頭頭是道，不僅射成平局，且奮勇作戰，嘆觀止矣。老實說：張金海的中衛打法雖好，但他是打前鋒終究比打中衛好的，昨日如果不是足部在改打中鋒後受了傷，我相信必會憑了他的衝刺力反敗為勝的，下半塲又整條國腳前鋒綫又臨人，還自挽不回敗回，尚有何說。</p>
<p>平心論事，昨日的一場，并不是人家打得好，而是自家打得壞，輸是輸得太不值的，可是我對對方的幾員得力人物，也不能不特別點出，而予以讚揚，李安納的正中衛，因為深知華人的踢法，而他本人又夠勇敢，夠鉅型，的是我華隊的勁敵，基亞能不愧是全港最好的一個左輔，最出人意外的是香港會美吾的捷疾處，眞出乎吾人意料之外，他之射入兩球雖然都似帶點幸運因素，但他之所以能在倖運中建功，卻是因敢作敢為，不輕放過些好機會，還有西維亞與羅差兩葡人的突有水凖又上的演出，是値得讚美的，他們也有其値得取勝之道。</p>

<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>馮諼在孟嘗君家做食客，高歌「長鋏歸來」，第一歌曰食無魚。西餐第二道菜，必定是魚，考究的且有吃魚的銀刀。可見無論中外人，吃飯總是要有魚的。現在桃花始開，刀魚上市，我來講一點刀魚麵。</p>
<p>刀魚是一年魚季最早之魚，其味最鮮而骨亦最多，因此尋常人家不備此菜。去年二月，余以事往揚州，路過鎭江，有友人請吃早茶。揚鎭一帶人吃早點，先泡一壺茶，繼之以酒，肴肉，干絲，再繼之以小籠包餃與麵。肴肉蘸量絲醋吃，自然是鎭江的名產，其刀魚麵尤爲他處所無。主人特囑夥計必須要「寬湯輕麵」，及麵至，但見一碗濃湯，吃到一半，始見有少許之麵，味極鮮美而無一魚骨。友人言吃刀魚麵，必須在二月，到三月淸明前，市上雖仍有此魚，已不爲人所重視。</p>
<p>鷄鴨猪牛肉終年皆有，魚則有其季節。如刀魚在桃化開時，河豚在有柳絮時，土附魚（又名黄　魚）在菜花開時，鰣魚在立夏時，黄鱔在夏初最好，過夏至節則味與質皆差，鱸魚在霜降時。魚又各有其獨特之美，如鱸魚以肝，鰣魚以腹，鲇魚以頭，鯽魚以舌及頭下背部之一塊，　魚以花，　魚以邊，靑魚以划水及其腹中之白，非老饕不能知之。</p>

<p>— 蕭風</p>
<p>在這個年頭，說話眞不容易。左了要被人載上一頂「奸匪」的紅帽子，右了又要被人加上「頑固」「反動」的頭銜。不左不右的中間派吧，似乎應該左右逢源了。然而不然，弄得不好，徒貽「投機」「帮閒」之譏。</p>
<p>讀過梁漱溟先生最近發表的三篇文章，一副公正無私的和事佬面孔，一方面要國民黨負全部戰爭的責任，一方面又要「共產黨應宣布三年作戰，事非得已，對國家人民所遭損害，同深疚歉」。雖然有點矛盾，但不如此，則不成爲「國共以外的公正人士」也。可惜的是梁先生的傑作，不能贏得喝采，反而噓聲四起，左邊的「中建」「新時代」等幾個刊物，以「質梁漱溟」，「斥梁漱溟」「梁漱溟政治的錯覺」……爲題，加以圍剿；而右邊的刊物「新希望」，也提出反對的意見，認爲「似乎這塲戰爭完全是國民黨在唱獨角戲，而共黨並沒有登傷一樣，這種說怯，是難以使人悅服的」。對於梁先生所發明的「封諡法」，一致認爲是一個很滑稽的辦法。以梁先生之善觀風色，面面俱到，猶不免受左右夾攻，無怪自由主義大師「過河卒子」胡適之先生，南飛以後，不聲不饗，誠屬識時務者也。</p>
<p>在政治協商會議時期，因爲國共雙方都爭取中間派人士，所以在夾縫中求生存的小黨派和社會賢達，紅極一時，大有左右逢源之樂。隨着政治形勢的變化，中間派人士已經不入於楊，即入於墨，頗感「左右做人難」，「左右不討好」的痛苦了。</p>
<p>日本已故名敎授河合榮治郎說得好：「右邊跟保守反動相抗爭，而擁護被壓迫思想，左邊跟唯物論的馬克思主義思想相鬥爭的我們，被右派認爲和馬克思主義一樣，被左派認爲和保守主義相同；這樣也許會受到左右兩面的夾擊，但這裏正有自由主義所獨有的使命，有自由主義所應負的寶貴任務。」這幾句話，眞能道出一個中間派份子底悲憤的情　。</p>

<p>— 王德雲</p>
<p>我在一個律師事務所裏服務已多年，因此對於各種訴訟及案子進行等等，也不無接觸。一夭到晚忙着寫被吿呀，原吿呀的，生活也差不多「等因奉此」似的刻板。我對於法律似乎是不大有興趣的，祗是對於光顧的各階層的當事人，常常很注意。當事人的份子頗複雜：工人·商買·學者·官員·車夫……甚麼都應有盡有。他們差不多總是緊張着臉容，不安地，激動地和律師談着。這種印象常使我想到：人與人之間的糾紛眞多呀。</p>
<p>當然，有種案子似乎必須訴諸法律。但也很有些沒甚大不了情事的，儘可和平解決的，人們却往往想不到這條捷徑，祇是一味感情用事。其實，和解的收穫，總比訴訟的結果滿意，這是無可否認的。就是律師，也不希望打官司，常從中勸解，但願息事寗人，「化干戈爲玉帛」。</p>
<p>當然，文明愈進步，社會環境愈複雜，人與人間的糾葛，與利害關係的衝突，也愈增多，似乎是不可免的。但因爭執而引起的不智行爲，却往往使雙方面兩敗俱傷，不可收拾。所以對於爭執的最好緩衝，就是圖謀和平之道。不但私人間和團體間是如此，擴大言之，卽使一國間的戰爭，和國際間的磨擦與冷戰，也何嘗不是如此呢？</p>

<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>在英國，有一種專門代替廣吿公司·廠商或其他人物寄發傳單的公司。規模宏大的「傳單公司」，竟備有世界各地一億人的姓各和住址。其中有一家是愛因斯坦的姪子開設的，他於希特勒攫得政權之日，逃到英倫，身邊僅有一張五鎊的鈔票。但在六年之內，便變成僱用職員二百五十人的大老闆了。</p>
<p>任何一個主顧，都可以委託傳單公司將他們的傳單，寄遞給自己所想接觸而不知姓名地址的人物。傳單公司雖然負責將傳單寄達指定身份的收件人，但是，却不將收件人的姓名住址洩露，因爲姓名住址正是他們的營業秘密。在另一方面，代發的傳單如因投遞無着而遭郵局退回，傳單公司即按比例將所收的代寄費用退回給委託人。</p>
<p>代寄傳單所收的費用，視傅單的份數和收件人的性質而定。普通是每二萬三千六百份收費四十八鎊。一家玻璃雨衣製造廠繳納了四十八鎊錢，但是，傳單剛寄出六千份，他就興奮地打電話給傳單公司，請求停寄。因爲他的存貨在第一批傳單寄出後，就賣完了。</p>
<p>不久以前，一個肥皂商委託傳單公司散發傳單給英國的一千二百萬名主婦，費用是每一千份兩鎊，共約二萬四千鎊。（不用說，郵資和紙張是由委託人自理的，但如果出錢託傳單公司代辦，亦可。）</p>
<p>傅單公司所代寄的傳單，並非僅限於商業性的。英國各政黨，就常利用它們分發政治性的傳單。有一次，蕭伯納想使他的「簡化拼音方案」引起上下院和愛爾蘭議會的每個議員的注意，也是委託傳單公司代寄他的建議書的。</p>
<p>傳單公司如何能探得那麼多的姓名地址呢？自然，電話簿，名人錄，通訊錄等之類的東西，都被利用到。此外，公司還派專人讀報，記載下每一個遲早會被應用到的姓名住址。並且，還搜購各種集會的參加者的名單，摘錄下有用的事項。</p>
<p>姓名住址一到傳單公司的手中，經過分門別類之後，就成了它們的資產。我想，上海民政局的戶籍科如果要兼營副業的話，附設一家英國那樣的傳單公司，倒是一筆好買賣呢。</p>

<p>— 寶珠</p>
<p>提起了羅斯福夫人，差不多沒有一個人不知道她是一位非常精明·能幹·偉大的女子，美國前任總統的好帮手。可是，杜魯鬥的夫人却是相反的默默無名，雖然她已經做了快四年的總統夫人了。不要說中國人不知道她，即美國人自己，對她也不大注意。一般對她的印象，除了「一個普通的家庭主婦」外，可以說沒有什麼其他値得一提的。</p>
<p>然而，和她接近的人，都知道這位美國第一夫人並不是人們想像中那麼平凡。她原來是杜魯門的最高顧問，杜總統在這次競選旅行中，介紹她的太太時，總說是：「我的老闆」。</p>
<p>杜夫人名字叫蓓絲，娘家姓華萊士，出生在米蘇里獨立城一個很富有和出名的家庭中。她自獨立城中學畢業後，並進過甘薩士城著名的巴斯道女子學校。蓓絲雖然是一個當家女兒，她却在女子學校裏敎過書。那時侯，她還未嫁給杜魯門，他們結婚到今年六月已將三十年了。</p>
<p>因爲她生性不喜歡交際和出風頭的緣故，所以更少機會使人們認識她，其實，她不但是個好主婦，還是一個很有見解，有天才有學問的女子。</p>
<p>她雖然從未演說過，可是杜魯門總統的演說詞，沒有一篇不是先經過她仔細閱讀，研究或加以改正的。當杜氏剛任議員的時候，蓓絲做過她的私人秘書，後來因爲女兒瑪格麗小時身體不大好，所以她才停止工作，在家裏看顧小孩和理家。她喜歡看書，尤其是對於歷史和傳記。做了一個偌大國家的總統，杜魯門當然很少時間來看書，可是不要緊，他的太太常常會把有關世界大事的文章看完了，摘要講給總統聽。蓓絲和她的丈夫·女兒一般，也喜歡音樂。此外，她愛好橋脾戲，可惜現在不大有空打。</p>
<p>杜夫人不太上照，因此在新聞照片上看見的第一夫人，是又矮又胖。其實這位六十四歲的老太太並不那麼醜陋，她有一個很小巧的面架子，五管端正，藍灰色的眼睛，銀灰色的頭髪總是梳得非常整齊的。當她剛進白宮的時候，她常常看到報章雜誌上說她像個「管家婆」。有一次，她苦笑著對她的朋友說：「那有什麼不好嗎？」蓓絲也喜歡穿講究的衣服，上等的料子；不過她很節儉，在白天，她總是穿很普通的衣服，晚禮服就要考究點了。</p>
<p>美國的政府官員，議員和太太們，都喜歡參加杜夫人的宴會，因爲蓓絲待人接物是十分親切和藹，使他們覺得似在自已家裏一般。席上的坐位用不到按着職位高低來排，不論有多少客人，總統夫人必須和每一個客人都說話。「她總是談關於你的事，而不把自巳的事搬出來誇耀」，一個客人回來吿訴別人說。她還燒得一手好菜。戰時，她雖已是個副總統夫人，但和其他普通的美國家庭一樣，一個女傭人也沒有。她說：「我的丈夫喜歡吃牛排和煎山芋，祗要我每晚給他做這兩樣菜，他已很高興了」。</p>
<p>不像一般的官太太要到名勝地點去旅行避暑，蓓絲每年夏天喜歡回到她的老家去，和她的母親一起住，把那些衛隊們趕光了，一個人在花園裏掘爛泥，澆花，或是約了她的老朋友們來打橋戲。</p>
<p>杜魯門夫人說不上如何偉大但至少也不笨俗。她對於她的丈夫，女兒和家庭是一個功臣，自然，對於美國也並非無益的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Cabinet Formation: Assembly Tomorrow; Peace Negotiation Issues to be Discussed; Current Foreign Policy Unlikely to Change <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The He cabinet, which has been under formation for a week, was declared complete on the 21st and, after being unanimously approved by the Kuomintang's Central Political Committee and Standing Committee in Nanjing, was appointed and announced by the Acting President. The entire cabinet consists of: one Deputy Premier, eight Ministers, two Heads of Commissions, and seven Political Councilors, totaling eighteen individuals. Except for the positions reserved for one member each from the People's and Youth Parties, the remaining sixteen individuals have been announced. Overall, among the sixteen names, nine are new appointments, and seven are reappointments, indicating a significant improvement compared to the past practice of reorganizing cabinets with mere superficial changes. However, among the newly appointed, very few lack previous administrative experience. For example, Jia Jingde, Zhang Zhiben, Li Hanhun, Duanmu Jie, He Yaozu, Mo Dehui, Hang Liwu, and others are merely being transferred in a carousel-like fashion. Only Liu Gongyun and Chuan Bingchang are truly new faces. Nevertheless, observing the overall lineup, the absence of the CC Clique demonstrates a positive aspect. However, the new cabinet evidently lacks new politicians with a bold and decisive style. Therefore, in terms of governance style, the He cabinet lineup appears to be somewhat weak. This list was submitted by He at 2:00 AM on the 21st to Acting President Li, who approved it. At 4:00 AM, at the Presidential Palace, Acting President Li invited the KMT Central Standing Committee members and Central Political Committee members to a discussion. Acting President Li and Premier He explained the process of forming the cabinet and introduced the list of cabinet members. By 5:30 AM, they had obtained full support and agreement from all attendees, and the President immediately appointed them, announcing it that evening.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held a meeting at 8:00 PM on the 21st at the Central Party Headquarters on Nan Di. Attendees included Wu Tiecheng, Tian Kunshan, Zou Lu, Li Wenfan, Xiao Tongzi, Zheng Yanfen, Gu Zhengding, Liu Wendao, Di Ying, Yao Dahai, Chen Qingyun, Hu Yiguan, and Lü Xiaodao. Zou Lu was elected chairman. After passing the motion to appoint Comrade Jia Jingde as the Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The new cabinet will be sworn in within three days and will hold its first political affairs meeting to discuss the most pressing issues of the moment. It is reported that the peace negotiation issue will be the primary topic of discussion, especially regarding the fact that the current peace negotiation representatives are only Shao Lizi and Zhang Zhizhong. The selection of additional representatives and the content of the peace talks will be discussed for the first time on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The appointment of Chuan Bingchang as Foreign Minister, with the consent of a majority of individuals within the Kuomintang, is indeed a novel manifestation of the new cabinet's style. However, whether Chuan's appointment as Foreign Minister while concurrently serving as the current Ambassador to the Soviet Union indicates a change in the current diplomatic policy is a matter of great concern to political figures. When this reporter inquired about the comments of several individuals on this matter, the majority, not knowing He's political views, declined to comment. Only one authoritative figure believed that it would not affect our current foreign policy, nor would it provoke any significant change in relations with the Soviet Union, as the Soviet attitude towards us is very clear and will not be drastically altered by this. As for the Soviet aid issue that some are worried about, this authoritative figure said: "The hope for Soviet aid was originally very slim."</p>

<h3 id="e4">Executive Yuan to Study Setting Up Propaganda Department <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] After the Legislative Yuan decided to abolish the Executive Yuan Information Office, the new He Yingqin cabinet no longer has an organization to oversee the office's considerable responsibilities. Several units are also located abroad. Since the organization no longer exists, the funding has naturally become a problem. He originally invited Bao Jingan, the former director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Army Headquarters, to serve as the Director of the Information Office. During the period when He was forming the cabinet, Bao assisted as He's spokesperson. It is now learned that He is studying the possibility of establishing a news and propaganda department within the Executive Yuan. Its organization will be much smaller than the Information Office, so as to handle the Information Office's business with the fewest personnel. Bao will still be asked to preside over it. However, since it concerns the organization of the Executive Yuan, it is necessary to amend the Executive Yuan Organization Law, which has not yet been decided.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party will convene a Central Standing Committee meeting at 9:00 AM this morning, personally presided over by Zhang Junmai, to make a final decision on the issue of participating in the new cabinet. As for the attitude of the Youth Party, according to the party spokesperson, after expressing their attitude on the 18th of this month, party Standing Committee member Wang Lanseng immediately took Li Huang's letter to Nanjing to personally present it to General He Yingqin. The letter earnestly explained the Youth Party's sincerity in supporting the He cabinet, but stated that under the current situation, not participating in the cabinet would be more helpful to the He cabinet. Wang returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. There are no key members of the Youth Party in Nanjing. The rumors that the party will take a position as a political councilor in the new cabinet are indeed inaccurate.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the case of the National Bank raising the price of silver dollars, which stimulated price increases, the Control Yuan appointed three supervisors, Hu Wenhui, Tang Honglie, and He Jizhou, to conduct an investigation. Hu and He visited Wu Xingzhou, the director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, on the morning of the 21st to conduct a preliminary inquiry and review the case files. The two intended to visit Liu Gongyun, but Liu returned to Shanghai by overnight train on the 20th. According to Hu Wenhui and Tang Honglie's report at the Control Yuan on the morning of the 21st, today was only a preliminary investigation, and they will need to go to Shanghai in the coming days to conduct a more thorough investigation. However, according to the preliminary investigation results on the 21st, it has already been proven that this approach is not only unhelpful to the national economy and the people's livelihood but is actually a "penny-wise, pound-foolish" move. Tang and Hu went to Shanghai on the night of the 21st.</p>

There are a total of seventeen Grand Justices, of which the Control Yuan has previously approved twelve. There are a total of nineteen Examination Committee Members, of which the Control Yuan has previously approved ten.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Yen Huiqing stated yesterday: The prospects for the Kuomintang-Communist peace negotiations are indeed long and uncertain. Before April, the peace negotiations are unlikely to begin because the government's peace negotiation representatives have not yet been determined. The candidates for representatives from both sides may be announced at the same time in the future. Dr. Yen predicted that the peace negotiations may drag on for one or two months without achieving anything. However, because both sides have a need for peace, an understanding will eventually be reached. Yen said: Because of my age and physical weakness, I am unwilling to serve as an official representative, but if there are twists and turns in the peace negotiations, I am still willing to mediate. Yen analyzed the process of the peace negotiations, saying that first, a basis for negotiation must be found, and then the relevant political, economic, and military issues must be resolved in turn. Among them, the issue of disarmament is the most complicated and difficult and should be handled by a small military committee.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the case of returning Yanliao to Lan Ni, after the former Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Property provided an explanation on this case, the original supervisors in the case, Xiong Zaiwei and Jin Yueguang, because they did not know Zhang Zhaoyuan's current address, could not deliver the official documents. They published a notice in the newspaper, instructing him to bring the relevant case files and personally attend a conversation at 11:00 AM on the 21st. Zhang arrived at the Control Yuan on time, and supervisors Xiong and Jin questioned him in detail on the Committee's handling of the case. The record of their conversation is as follows:</p>
<p>Q: Mr. Zhang, from which meeting did you start participating in the Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Property?</p>
<p>A: From the 22nd meeting. The Lan case was an item for discussion. The 22nd meeting discussed Lan Yezhen's request to return 84 barrels of Indanthrene dyes in order to protect property rights. The resolution was to approve the return. If it could not be paid with goods of the same type and quality, it should be returned at the market price. When this case was passed, only Ye Gongchao's representative made a reservation on the spot.</p>
<p>Q: Please provide all the files for review.</p>
<p>A: These files are in the seventh group of the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan. I resigned on March 5th. Please have your esteemed court directly review the files.</p>
<p>Q: Were there any meetings held after the 22nd meeting?</p>
<p>A: Two meetings were held after that. The 24th meeting was held in Guangzhou, which I did not attend. It was presided over by Minister Zhao Chen.</p>
<p>Q: In what way was the Lan case brought up at the 22nd meeting?</p>
<p>A: It was brought up in writing.</p>
<p>Q: How did the Lan case proceed during the 22nd meeting?</p>
<p>A: The number of attendees at the 22nd meeting, including the chairman, was 16. Except for Ye Gongchao's representative, Zhang Tingzheng, who made a statement reserving his opinion, there were no other objections.</p>
<p>Q: What is the basis for Lan Yezhen's ownership?</p>
<p>A: Lan Yezhen has a receipt, but I have not seen it.</p>
<p>Q: Did Le Runting's testimony explain that the warehouse receipt belonged to Lan Yezhen?</p>
<p>A: I can't remember.</p>
<p>Q: The dyes that Le Runting applied to return were vulcanized indigo, while the dyes that Lan Ni applied to return were Indanthrene indigo. The quality is different, and the price is different. Was this not studied?</p>
<p>A: These dyes are of the same type, only the brand is different. Because it was based on the description on the warehouse receipt, this issue was not studied.</p>
<p>Q: Le Runting stated that he was the sole proprietor of the dyes and had people prove that he was the sole proprietor. There were no other names on the warehouse receipt. Did the Committee study this?</p>
<p>A: I remember that the file contained opinions stating that according to the customs of Shanghai merchants, an agent could come forward.</p>
<p>Q: Did the agent state who he was an agent for? Also, the warehouse receipt was paid by Le Runting, and Lan Yezhen has already applied for it. Has this been studied?</p>
<p>A: At the meeting, many committee members arrived temporarily. In fact, it was not deeply studied, only based on the annotations of the person in charge.</p>
<p>Q: Mr. Zhang, do you have any other comments?</p>
<p>A: (1) According to merchant customs, the warehouse receipt does not necessarily have to be in my name; (2) The Clearing Office said that Lan Yezhen also had a receipt, but I have not seen the receipt; (3) Lan Yezhen submitted a witness to the Clearing Office.</p>
<p>Q: After Lan Yezhen submitted the witness, how did the Executive Yuan instruct?</p>
<p>A: The Executive Yuan believed that the witness was sufficient and then transferred the case to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for interpretation.</p>
<p>Q: What was the opinion of the Ministry of Judicial Administration?</p>
<p>A: The Ministry of Judicial Administration believed that Lan Yezhen's request for return was not without basis and could be studied again by the handling agency.</p>
<p>Q: After Lan submitted the witness, did the Executive Yuan submit new evidence to the Clearing Office after it believed that it was insufficient?</p>
<p>A: I can't remember clearly and need to check the case file.</p>
<p>Q: What explanation did the Ministry of Judicial Administration make on this?</p>
<p>A: The Ministry of Judicial Administration explained that the government should have the burden of proof for confiscating enemy and puppet property. This is a general principle. As for Lan Yezhen and Le Runting, it is another matter.</p>
<p>Q: Reports say that after this court's investigation, it notified the China Trust Bureau to stop payment. When was that official letter sent?</p>
<p>A: I notified the China Trust Bureau by phone to stop payment and did not approve Lan An Yezhen.</p>
<p>Signatures: Xiong Zaiwei, Jin Yueguang, Zhang Zhaoyuan.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The case of former Premier of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke misappropriating 110 million yuan of national funds in the name of "confidential expenses" has been investigated and verified by supervisors Yu Peihou and Ni Bi, who have filed an impeachment. After review and establishment, the impeachment document has been sent by the Control Yuan to the Presidential Palace and the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office on the morning of the 21st to prosecute according to law and recover the funds that have already been spent (the full text of the impeachment document has been published in the first edition of this newspaper on the 19th).</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Control Yuan held its 42nd meeting on the morning of the 20th, chaired by Yu Youren, to broadly review politics. Supervisors spoke enthusiastically and expressed deep concerns about the current issues of political reform. Cao Dexuan, Yu Zhenzhou, Liu Pingjiang, Qiu Niantai, and others all advocated for new policies, new personnel, strict punishment of corruption, strict enforcement of the rule of law, respect for the power of supervision, and reduction of agencies. Ye Duoxiu, Zhang Dinghua, Wang Guanwu, Lu Fengge, Cao Dexuan, and others provided many opinions on military issues. They all believed that the size of the Ministry of National Defense's organization, the phenomenon of phantom soldiers in the army, the corruption of military discipline, and the low treatment of soldiers should be corrected. Wang Xiangchen also pointed out that the only issue in the military is the issue of troop consolidation. If the troops cannot be consolidated, and units of over 100,000 men continue to report 500,000, not only will there be no way to solve the financial problems, the treatment of the troops cannot be improved, and nothing else can be discussed. The afternoon continued with the review. Supervisors spoke on fiscal, economic, and border issues. They strongly criticized inflation, high-interest loans, and banning commercial practices. The meeting adjourned at 5:40 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Jiangbei Still Maintains Original Positions; Communist Army Still Incapable of Crossing the River; Military Official Analyzes Military Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the reports in the Nanjing and Shanghai newspapers of the 21st that "the Communist army in Jiangbei has completed preparations to cross the river," this reporter inquired with a senior military official here. According to him: Chen Yi's troops suffered heavy losses after the Xuzhou campaign. In the past two months, it can be said that they have completed the replenishment of troops, but it is obviously inconsistent with the facts to say that they have completed preparations to cross the river. The Jiangbei area is entirely a region of lakes and swamps, with crisscrossing rivers and streams. The original highways and bridges are mostly dilapidated and cannot be completed in a short period of time. Before the completion of this project, the Communist army cannot use its heavy artillery units. If the heavy artillery units cannot be used, they will not be able to suppress the Nationalist naval vessels moving on the river and carry out their plan to land in front of the enemy. This is one reason. The 18 armies of Chen Yi, totaling more than 400,000 men, need ammunition and supplies for the river-crossing offensive. With the current transportation lines in Jiangbei and the Communist army's transportation capabilities, who would believe that they have completed preparations? This is the second reason. More importantly, regarding the preparation of river-crossing tools such as ships, the investigation reports from all parties have not yet reached the completion stage. This is the third reason. As for the claim that they have completed preparations for attacking the bridgeheads in Jiangbei, this is still possible. However, before the official breakdown of peace negotiations, the Communist army may not do this. This is why the Communist army in Jiangbei has only been conducting probing attacks in recent days and has not launched a full-scale offensive. Furthermore, the Nationalist army has maintained all of its original positions.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Since the Chongqing warship mutiny incident occurred, the Ministry of National Defense has specially dispatched officials to Nanjing and Shanghai to investigate the matter. It is learned that the results have been obtained and will be announced soon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the Chongqing warship mutiny case, the Control Yuan has appointed Cao Dexuan and Lu Fengge to conduct an investigation. Cao and Lu are scheduled to visit Gui Yongqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, at the Naval Headquarters on the afternoon of the 22nd to conduct inquiries.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Commander Who Led the Team; Commander Chen Jiashang; Flew to Nanjing from Qingdao Yesterday to Report on the Process <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 21st] Commander Chen Jiashang of the Second Air Force Region, who personally led the team to direct the bombing of the Chongqing warship, flew to Nanjing from here at 9:00 AM on the 21st to report that the mission of punishing the mutinous warship had come to an end. A few minutes before departing, he spoke to this newspaper's correspondent from the headquarters forty miles away via military telephone. He said that after the final reconnaissance, the warship had mostly sunk and the bottom of the ship had already turned over. His tone was very decisive and excited.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the continuous and fierce bombing of the mutinous Chongqing warship by the air force for two days, as of the morning of the 20th, it has rapidly sunk. According to the air force reconnaissance report on the 20th, the bombing was concentrated on the stern of the ship, and the bombs that hit totaled 8,000 pounds. On the evening of the 19th, the ship was seen to be tilting to the right and gradually sinking. On the 20th, it was discovered that two-thirds of the left side of the ship was facing the sky, and the deck and command tower were submerged in the sea. There was still thick black smoke rising from the stern of the ship. According to the air force's judgment, because the depth of Huludao harbor is not high, the current state of the Chongqing warship capsizing has probably reached its peak, and complete submersion is practically impossible. However, with the equipment of all the excellent ports in the Far East, including Lushun and Dalian, there is no way to lift the ship out of the water, tow it elsewhere, or repair the damaged parts. In the future, the use of part of the Huludao harbor docks will be difficult to restore for several years due to the sinking of the ship. The Air Force now believes that the function of the mutinous Chongqing warship has been completely lost, so the bombing mission was completely terminated on the 20th. The armor on the stern of the Chongqing warship is three inches thick, and its anti-aircraft firepower is extremely high. Foreigners here were surprised that our air force was able to successfully complete the bombing mission in two days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] It is learned that about 20 people were killed and more than 80 were injured on the Chongqing warship. The rest mostly landed ashore. After the news of the ship's mutiny was confirmed, Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing reported to the Ministry of National Defense and requested punishment himself.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] It is reported that after the Chongqing warship was bombed and the oil depot, stern, and many other places on the ship caught fire on the 19th, the 20th Air Force B-24S aircraft, in four batches, led by Lieutenant Colonel Shui Jianpan, flew north over Huludao and discovered that the ship's body had already tilted. They immediately continued to drop 1,000-pound giant bombs, all of which hit the ship. Among them, the fourth batch of B-24 aircraft that entered to drop bombs caused great damage to the broken ship with two out of four bombs directly hitting it. When the last batch flew south from Huludao, they discovered that the ship had already turned over from tilting, with the bottom of the ship facing the sky. At this point, the fate of the Chongqing was completely destroyed.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Editorial: Thoughts on the Pacific Pact <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Following the public announcement of the contents of the Atlantic Pact, opinions in various countries have differed greatly, but all countries in the Far East hope that the United States will take the initiative to organize a Pacific alliance similar to the Atlantic Pact, especially as expressed in the remarks of Philippine President Quirino. Mr. Quirino frankly stated: "The United States should not concentrate all its attention on Europe but should take a leading role in the Far East, first initiating the formation of a Pacific alliance similar to the Atlantic Pact, to combat Communism in the Far East. If the United States abandons us, it will lose its vast potential in the Far East. Europe has its economic value, but Asia is also a virgin land with unlimited resources, and the United States should not disappoint us in the East." Therefore, his conclusion is: "The Pacific Pact is feasible, and there is no reason to oppose it. On the contrary, there are many benefits."</p>
<p>President Quirino's ardent desire for a Pacific Pact is evident in his words. In fact, in today's turbulent Far East Pacific region, who does not hope for a regional security mechanism? When commenting on the Atlantic Pact, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Wellington Koo, also frankly stated: "The conclusion of the Atlantic Pact is a valuable achievement for peace and security, and the collective security ideal of the United Nations Charter has been partially realized. Unfortunately, this pact only includes one side of the world peace front. If world peace is to be effectively guaranteed, the other side of the peace front, Asia, should also have a similar organization to prevent aggression." Although Ambassador Koo did not directly mention the Pacific Pact, his desire for its early conclusion is no less than that of the Philippine President.</p>
<p>Rumors of negotiating a Pacific Pact have been circulating for a long time. The main reason is that all countries in Southeast Asia feel threatened by the strength of Communism and must jointly seek ways to defend themselves against Communism to ensure local security and peace in the Far East Pacific region. Since the rise of the Chinese Communist Party, the power of Asian Communist parties has invaded southward, day by day. Whether it is Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaya, Siam, or Burma, even Australia, the Philippines, and India have felt the threat of Communism. In early March, Indian Prime Minister Nehru initiated the Southeast Asian Dominion Conference, ostensibly for the internal strife in Burma, but in reality, was it not for regional security in Southeast Asia? At the same time, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, for the sake of his own sense of security, also strongly advocated that Southeast Asia should establish an organization similar to the Western European Union to resist foreign aggression. He volunteered to say that since Britain is busy with European affairs and has no time to take care of them, Australia is willing to step forward and guide the Southeast Asian Dominions to defend themselves against Communism. In fact, we have had such predictions for a year, but unfortunately, very few contemporary statesmen with foresight can do what it takes to turn the tide. As a result, today's situation has been created. Only when the overall situation in China is shaken do people feel the anxiety in Southeast Asia and the dangerous situation in the Pacific, but it is almost too late.</p>
<p>The preparation of the Pacific Pact seems to have been going on for several months. Most recently, when British Cabinet Special Envoy Listowel visited Canberra to discuss Pacific defense with the Australian Cabinet, this rumor became even more concrete. Australian Defense Minister Dedman also clearly announced in Parliament: "Under the initiative of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, countries in the Pacific region have already begun discussions to establish a Pacific Pact similar to the Atlantic Pact, to prevent the expansion of Communism and facilitate reconstruction work." However, because the British Foreign Office insisted on its own views, the Pacific Pact could not be negotiated until after the Atlantic Pact was completed, so the Pacific Pact was shelved again. Now, the content of the Atlantic Pact has been announced and is scheduled to be signed in Washington on April 4th, which can be regarded as the completion of the Atlantic Pact. In terms of procedure, negotiations on the Pacific Pact can begin. Moreover, the Pacific countries have been encouraged by the Atlantic Pact and are even more eager for the Pacific Pact to be realized as soon as possible. Looking at the trend, the negotiation of the Pacific Pact may have the momentum of "when the water comes, the canal is formed." According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press on the 19th, the United States is quite interested in the suggestions of Mr. Quirino, and the British side will also express its approval. Prospects for diplomatic activities are about to officially begin.</p>
<p>Standing in the position of a third party, we would like to put forward several prerequisites for the conclusion of the Pacific Pact: First, the US policy of emphasizing Europe and underemphasizing Asia should be changed immediately, and the focus of its diplomatic activities should be quickly shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific. But we see that the United States still hopes that Britain will take more responsibility in the Far East, which shows that the United States has no intention of changing its policy. If the United States is unwilling to take a leading role in the Far East and only knows how to vigorously promote the Pacific Pact, even if the Pacific Pact is concluded in the future, its meaning will be greatly reduced, or it may even lead to unexpected adverse consequences. Second, the United Kingdom's view of the Pacific Pact still focuses on the security of its Southeast Asian Dominions, and there is no long-term plan for the entire Asia. In particular, its attitude towards the Chinese Communist Party is fundamentally contradictory to its attempt to promote the Pacific Pact. Third, China is the only stabilizing force in the Pacific. Any regional security mechanism, whether it is the Pacific Pact or the Southeast Asian League, will not have much effect if China is not included in it. Therefore, any arrangements made by the United Kingdom in Asia must first find a way to stabilize the situation in China and prevent the entire China from being ruled and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party alone, thereby causing the entire Asian continent to fall into the Soviet Iron Curtain. If this prerequisite cannot be achieved, all other plans are in vain. Fourth, Indian Prime Minister Nehru does not seem very enthusiastic about the Pacific Pact and has already expressed his opposition. We have studied Nehru's intentions and believe that Nehru's opinions are very worthy of attention by the United Kingdom and the United States. It must be known that today's era is the Asian century, and Asian countries must not be treated with the past perspective of colonies. If the United Kingdom and the United States can prove with facts that Nehru's concerns are unnecessary, then India and Pakistan will also be happy to join the Pacific Pact.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] The newly established Committee to Aid China issued a statement today, strongly arguing that the United States can still effectively aid China in its anti-communist war, as long as it promptly provides military and economic aid, along with moral support. Committee Chairman McKee said that the purpose of the new committee is to list the current situation in China and its impact on the United States to the American people. As long as the US government issues a clear promise to aid anti-communism, it can give China great moral support. Mr. McKee proposed: 1. Give economic aid, including loans charged with tariff revenue; 2. Send a military delegation to China, with the same nature as the US military delegation to Greece; 3. Provide military supplies, such as light equipment, small arms, and ammunition.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Conditions Differ in Eastern Countries; Communists Do Not Follow the Soviet Union?; Remarks by Nozaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Nozaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, told a United Press reporter today: The Chinese Communist Party will not take the Yangtze River as the boundary and will eventually control the entire country. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the CCP is completely united. Rumors that its policies are inconsistent with those of Li Lisan and others are not true. The first thing the CCP wants is to establish a democratic government, which is the hope of realistic nationalists. The CCP and the JCP cannot replicate Soviet communism because their national conditions are not suitable. Therefore, they can only abide by their own routes and do not need to follow Moscow. The JCP does not need to contact the CCP or other communist parties in the East, nor does it intend to do so. The Eastern Communist International Intelligence Week, there is no such organization now, nor is there a need for it.

<p>[Our Newspaper News] According to a broadcast from the CCP radio station, the Tianjin CCP Bureau is now adopting a method of direct management by employees for state-owned factories and enterprises taken over from the government. It is reported that the CCP adopted this method because of the lack of various technical personnel and to induce the original workers to cooperate with the Communist Party. According to the CCP, the Military Control Commission has approved employees to implement "democratic management" and the original salary system, "without disrupting the original enterprise organization, thereby stabilizing the employees' morale and completing the complete takeover" to achieve the goal of restoring production. It is claimed that the CCP firmly stated that "Kuomintang special agents and certain pseudo-trade union directors, employees, foremen, and guards who oppress workers and rape female workers and still do not repent must be eliminated" as a condition for exchange. At the same time, the "unreasonable system" in terms of wages, material resources, personnel, systems, and organization during the government era must also be reformed. The Tianjin Railway Bureau convened a conference of employee representatives from all its factories, sections, and stations to discuss this matter. In addition, the Public Bus Management Office, the factories of the China Textile Company, and the Pingjin Clothing Factory also experienced the same situation.</p>

<p>An Intelligence Officer Who Lived in Tibet for Eight Years Talks After Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>[United Press, This City] Reliable sources said on the 21st that if the government's military strength in Xikang is further weakened, the Tibetan government is preparing to enter Xikang Province to take over. A Chinese intelligence officer who had lived in Tibet for eight years recently came to Shanghai. He said: If Liu Wenhui further weakens the defense of Xikang, the Tibetan government, with the assistance of the Tusi in Xikang, will quickly occupy Xikang and place it under direct control. He said: Liu is at odds with Wang Lingji, Chairman of Sichuan, and is no longer interested in Xikang, which has a small population and scarce resources. The Tusi of Xikang will sincerely welcome the entry of a total of 150,000 Tibetan troops who share the same religion with them. He said: "The Tibetan government is currently ruled by the 15-year-old Dalai Lama, but in fact it is ruled by the Dalai Lama's teacher, but he is now 70 years old and it is difficult to manage major affairs, so the real power is in the hands of the four major families. Because of their education and personal interests, they tend to be more pro-British than pro-Chinese. The Chinese government only has a branch of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in Tibet, which is responsible for everything from education to diplomacy. There is no branch of the Central Bank in Tibet, and all remittances and transactions are handled by Indian banks. The Tibetan currency system is linked to the British pound sterling group, so the economic situation is more stable than in other parts of China." It is also known that although Tibet is recognized by all countries in the world (including Britain) as part of China, the passport of the Tibetan trade delegation that visited Europe and the United States last year was not obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese government, but from the British government in Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Reasons for the Mutiny of the Chongqing Warship; Air Force Bombing and Recognition of Contributing Personnel <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The most deadly bomb that destroyed the Chongqing warship was dropped on the 18th by bombadier Wen Guangqin from the aircraft. This bomb severely damaged the ship, rendering it immobile. The B-24 aircraft carrying the bombardier on this mission was piloted by Major Yang Yongtao. More aircraft went on missions on the 19th, and all the bombs dropped exploded on the ship, with the furthest being within 50 meters of the ship. On this day, Wen Guangqin again dropped a fatal bomb from Yang Yongtao's plane, hitting the ship's tail oil depot, causing the entire ship to catch fire. On the 19th, other planes piloted by Huang Feida, Wang Taiyun, and Li Jianlun also hit the ship with bombs, while Wang Yongxi and Ji Ren, through bombing, hit parts of the ship's surface. These two groups of crew members, totaling six people, have been identified as figures who made special contributions. During the three days of bombing, the anti-aircraft fire was very intense on the 18th and 19th, and the height of the shells exceeded the position of the aircraft. As a result, the oil pipe of the third engine of the plane piloted by Wang Dingji was broken by shrapnel, which hindered flight, but Wang Dingji still managed to fly the plane back and safely land at the base. Others, such as Liu Xirui and Hou Yuan, went to bomb for three days, and pilots such as Jin Zhineng, Yu Keying, and Song Tianxin all calmly went back and forth, accomplishing their missions. It was truly the most successful group action of the squadron. In this battle to bomb the Chongqing, the B-25 aircraft of the Ninth Squadron also flew to participate in the bombing. When the C-47 transport plane went to scout for the first time, it was heavily attacked by ground artillery fire. The pilots Jiang Fukao and Wang Jindu were captivated by the scenery above Huludao, and their flight was so low and close to the Chongqing before returning. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Although the reasons for the betrayal of the Chongqing warship are very complex, according to insiders familiar with the navy, the main reasons are nothing more than: (1) As everyone knows, the salaries of officers and soldiers are too low, and the life of the officers and soldiers of the ship during their internship in England is worlds apart from their life after returning home. (2) Among the officers and soldiers of the navy, there are always divisions of the Mawei faction, the Beiyang faction, and the Qingdao faction, and the internal struggles are extremely fierce. When Chen Shaokuan was in charge of the Naval Headquarters, the naval orders were almost all monopolized by the people of the Mawei faction. After Gui Yongqing took office, he broke this regional concept in many ways, which was dissatisfactory to the people of the Fujian faction. Deng Zhaoxiang, the former captain of the Chongqing warship, belonged to the Mawei faction, while the new captain (probationary captain) Lu Dongge (from Hebei) belonged to the Beiyang faction. When the Naval Headquarters announced Lu's succession to Deng as the captain of the Chongqing warship, it was met with dissatisfaction from Deng and some Mawei faction figures on the ship. Therefore, the departure of the Chongqing warship, with personnel friction, should be its most important factor. (3) Up to now, the materials obtained by the relevant parties indicate that there were only four or five communist agents lurking on the ship who were engaged in instigating betrayal before the ship's departure. The judgment is that these few people were able to force the ship to sail north by taking advantage of Captain Deng's knowledge that he was being transferred and his dissatisfaction with the Naval Headquarters, inciting Deng to issue a false order and sail north directly. After all, the captain is the highest person in charge of a ship, and all orders must be obeyed unconditionally. According to the relevant parties, the new captain Lu Dongge had been credited for his command of a naval unit in the battles of Yingkou and Huludao in the past. When the Naval Headquarters learned that the ship had sailed north on its own and had not sailed towards Taiwan, it still believed that it might be Captain Deng who had sailed the ship north, telling Probationary Captain Lu to "learn by doing." Later, after the Naval Headquarters ordered Captain Deng to sail south by radio and he did not comply, it became aware of the mutiny.</p>

Because the two National Taiwan University students did not speak the local language, they had an argument with the police officers when they were interfered with, which led to them being beaten and abused.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] The foreign ministers of the countries participating in the Atlantic Pact will gather in Washington around April 1. This meeting will be the last meeting before the signing of the pact on April 4, aimed at discussing practical plans to implement the pact as soon as possible and effectively. According to political circles here, Bevin, Schuman, and Acheson will also discuss the German issue, especially the two issues of reparations and the constitution of the West German Federation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 21st] According to a senior United Nations official, we can guess that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and his first assistant Gromyko will come here next month to attend the United Nations General Assembly, which opens on April 5, and lead the Soviet delegation to fight on the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Soviet Union has not yet notified the United Nations of the lower-level members of the delegation, and has always not notified them until after the delegation has set off. Vyshinsky seized the opportunity last autumn. Vyshinsky is an experienced debater. When the General Assembly discusses the former Italian colonies, the Soviet delegation will take the opportunity to mention the entire policy of the United States in the Mediterranean, and then turn to the North Atlantic Treaty. The Dingfang countries will also be represented by senior personnel. The General Assembly has received notification that French Foreign Minister Schuman will attend in person. British Foreign Secretary Bevin will be in the United States at that time, or he may also attend. Romanin, the former Soviet Consul General in New York and Gromyko's friend, may also come with him. Romanin was ordered to leave the country in August last year due to the Soviet elementary school teacher jumping out of the window. There has been no news of him since then, until last week. He appeared at Vyshinsky's reception in Moscow as the acting director of the news agency. Romanin had attended the United Nations Freedom of Information Committee. Although the United States was unwilling to accept him as the Consul General, Romanin could still attend the General Assembly session as a representative.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] Marshal Sokolovsky, commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in Germany, ordered a strict blockade around the western districts of Berlin this morning to prevent residents of West Berlin from transporting large amounts of East German Marks, which had been discontinued in the Ding district, into the eastern district. However, a large amount still slipped in, and people were rushing to buy goods in the eastern district stores.</p>
<p>Observers predict that the Ding district authorities' order to ban East German Marks will intensify the Cold War between the East and West. The Berlin West District City Council held a meeting in a tense atmosphere today. While welcoming this measure by the Western authorities, they expressed concern about the countermeasures that the Soviet authorities might take. Berlin West District Mayor Reuter stated at a press conference that the measures taken by the Dingfang authorities were in line with our opinions. The German industry in West Berlin can now get rid of the chaos of the two currencies and obtain real assistance.</p>
<p>The Plan to Merge Berlin into West Germany is Gradually Being Realized</p>
<p>Commanders Bourne and Hollar of the British and American Berlin jointly held a press conference, saying that the new measures of the currency system in Ding Berlin had been under consideration for a long time, and this move was tantamount to completely absorbing the currency system of the West Berlin district into the West German currency system. The merger of Berlin into Ding Germany is gradually being realized. Hollar also said that the Soviet authorities can at most take blockade measures, but the Allied authorities have overcome the difficulties caused by the blockade. He thinks that the Soviet side cannot take more cruel retaliatory actions for the time being.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 20th] The British Balkans are skeptical of reports of troop movements in Yugoslavia's neighboring countries, believing it to be "psychological warfare." They believe that the Kremlin will launch an anti-Tito movement within Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Communist International leaders have never recognized Yugoslavia as a simple country in normal events. Yugoslavia is expected to eventually split into different ethnic countries, such as Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia, and Montenegro. From the end of the war until the Stalin-Tito conflict began, the key to the Soviet Union's policy was to form a federal Yugoslav state. The main storm within Yugoslavia in the future will be (1) Macedonia, which has one million residents opposed to Tito, and Communist Party members in Greece and Albania. The supporters of the Communist International in Macedonia advocate the establishment of an independent Macedonian state. (2) Montenegro, which has 300,000 residents, is the province with the most traditional pro-Soviet sentiment in Yugoslavia. (3) Croatia, which has 3.5 million residents, has strong anti-Tito forces, especially due to the influence of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Deeply Hope That Far Eastern Countries Will Strengthen Cooperation</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] London, broadcast on the 21st: Since Philippine President Quirino advocated that the United States should lead the organization of the Pacific Pact, British officials have not commented on it, but it is generally believed that the British greatly approve of it. However, the British government has recently been most concerned about the impact of India's independence on the various autonomous territories. An informed source said: After the establishment of the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Pact, the Pacific Pact has become a natural consequence. If the Ding European countries continue to encounter setbacks in their position in the Far East, the prosperity of Ding Europe will be greatly affected in fact, and the United States will also suffer indirectly. However, the resources of the United States are ultimately limited. Therefore, places in the Far East such as Australia, New Zealand, Malaya, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Korea, Siam, Indonesia, Vietnam, and India must strengthen cooperation to resist the threat of communism.</p>

<p>— Biao</p>
<p>Unintentionally, today's world is a world dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union, or, in short, a bipolar world. At the same time, the two powers are playing distinctly different tunes. The Soviet Union has been infiltrating its political influence in Europe and Asia, while the Western European democratic bloc of countries, with the support of the United States, is also busy resisting. In this situation, one cannot help but wonder whether the life of the United Nations will end in the competition between the two powers, followed by the outbreak of World War III.</p>
<p>Since neither of the two powers currently has the strength to control the entire world, and the Soviet Union is currently entitled to recover the losses suffered during the war, it will not easily provoke a direct conflict with democratic countries. Although people are well aware that the United States surpasses any other country in military strength, possessing atomic bombs and strong land and sea forces, and backed by a large industrial capacity, it is unlikely to provoke a devastating war against public opinion, at least under the current democratic system.</p>
<p>Although Soviet leaders have different opinions on the future peace of the world, they have a firm and unchanging view that capitalism itself has an inherent error factor. Therefore, before the atomic bomb is manufactured, the Soviet Union will patiently wait for the demise of capitalism, except for waiting for opportunities.</p>
<p>However, a small number of extremists believe that the two ideologies have no reason to coexist and will eventually conflict. Instead of waiting until atomic bombs have all been manufactured before engaging in war, it is better to let it break out sooner, which can be resolved quickly and avoid a prolonged war that causes misery to the people. Obviously, this view is extremely wrong. The reasons can be summarized into roughly three points:</p>
<p>(1) Modern warfare relies not only on superior weapons to win, but also on possessing a large number of well-trained troops and rapid mobilization as a supplement to achieve the goal. With the advancement of modern warfare weapons, the key to victory lies in the two conditions of "blitzkrieg" and "surprise." The United States, which possesses atomic bombs, lacks both. (2) If the United States were to launch a war, it would inevitably have to seek a final victory. However, in the brutal process of modern warfare, both enemies and friends would inevitably be destroyed. The result would be nothing more than turning the two powers into one power, and this single-power world is not what the United States and the Soviet Union want. Therefore, launching World War III is meaningless. (3) If we were to use the power of atomic bombs to force the enemy to surrender, then in future international occasions, it would be difficult for us to get friendly countries to get along in mutual trust. The world after that would still be in an unstable state of mutual suspicion. If a country wins twice with atomic bombs, it will be difficult to win over friendly countries with mutual trust to jointly maintain world peace.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, stopping war with war is by no means a good strategy for seeking peace, unless there is a particularly provocative event between the two countries, or one party has a challenging behavior. We believe that world peace can still be achieved if properly managed. If the United States holds a view that the current state of mutual calm is only a temporary truce, and that once the opportunity matures, we will face a well-prepared and powerful enemy, then future peace will be difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>The current problem is that if the United States tries to maintain world peace solely by strengthening its military force, then the United States' preparations for war will be enough to stimulate the Soviet Union's preparations for war. If the United States has atomic bombs, the Soviet Union can also research and manufacture them. Such unlimited expansion of military power will result in an unprecedented and devastating war. In this war, both sides will use the latest weapons against each other, using long-range aircraft to bomb each other, turning prosperous cities into ruins in an instant. Even if victory is achieved, national strength and culture cannot be restored in a short period of time. As a result, the powers after the war will actually be inferior to underdeveloped countries that have not participated in the war, and will no longer be first-class powers that dominate the world.</p>
<p>The reasons why the United States was fortunate enough to win the past two world wars were nothing more than the following two points: (1) The United States was able to smoothly convert peacetime industries into wartime industries; (2) It used Western European allies as a forward base and the distance of the Atlantic Ocean to win sufficient time for mobilization and preparation.</p>
<p>However, in future atomic warfare, it will be extremely difficult to obtain the time to change industries. At the same time, the Western European powers are no longer as capable as before, and the distance of the ocean cannot be used as a security barrier. Unless the United States converts wartime industries before the outbreak of war, the United States' fighting power is expected to be far less than before. In the course of fierce war, if atomic bombs are used as weapons, regardless of the amount, the lives and property of both sides will be destroyed, and everyone will perish together.</p>
<p>Since war is not a blessing for either side, and peace is what the world hopes for, to win peace, the international order must first be balanced. So-called balancing means that the Soviet Union and Western European democratic countries can coexist and work for common interests, thereby reducing conflicts and animosity between the two powers.</p>
<p>If there are only the United States and the Soviet Union in the world, the future of peace will be worrying. It will be difficult for the two countries to maintain a balance. Fortunately, in addition to the two powers, there are many independent countries with vast resources and a large population, which can be intermediaries for collective security. If these intermediaries strengthen their power, they can become a powerful force for maintaining world peace and creating a balanced international order.</p>
<p>If the many intermediary countries are weak and chaotic, then these weak and chaotic countries can easily become satellite states of any one power, and the consequence will be that the balance of the world will be lost, and world turmoil will be unavoidable. On the other hand, if the politics of the intermediary countries can be stable, the economy can be revived, and they are not controlled by any one power, then not only can the two powers have room for buffer, but world peace can also be sustained as a result.</p>
<p>There are three ways to win international peace: (1) The United States establishes a powerful and unparalleled military force to force all countries to abide by their posts and jointly maintain international peace; (2) The United States and the Soviet Union directly conclude a treaty without other relations to implement an international non-interference policy; (3) Assist intermediary countries in establishing a Eurasian balanced system, so that different ideologies can coexist in the world, recognizing the existence of struggle, and using methods other than war to resolve disputes between the two countries.</p>
<p>We believe that the first method, in addition to deliberately building a strong military force, cannot achieve international coexistence, but only stimulates the determination of another power to expand its military. Using military force to maintain peace, peace will not be permanent, so seeking peace with military force is a dream.</p>
<p>The second method, in which the United States and the Soviet Union conclude a treaty alone and coexist with other friendly countries in a non-interfering manner, would certainly pose no problem for world peace if it could be realized. However, judging from the current situation, there are at least the following two difficulties: (1) Under the current circumstances, the United States and the Soviet Union still suspect each other, and in the past, they have held different views and funded different hostile policies of intermediary countries. Under these circumstances, even if a treaty is concluded, is it not dead in name only, and what is the use? (2) Among the two powers, there are still many countries with political corruption and economic disorder, and it is almost hopeless to reform on their own. If we sit idly by and allow the source of chaos to grow, it will eventually affect world peace. At this time, foreign aid is naturally needed. If, under the non-interference treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union, these countries become poor and weak and unable to extricate themselves, and the weak are placed next to strong neighbors, war will inevitably occur, and peace will become a bubble.</p>
<p>The third method is to recognize the existence of the struggle between the two systems and to hope that this struggle exists in a peaceful state. This peaceful struggle is the so-called "cold war." The Cold War includes political and economic pressure on each other, ideological and psychological offensives, and other strategies such as using propaganda and infiltration to achieve the goal of its superiority. It is generally believed that the danger of the Cold War is nothing more than that the Cold War may provoke a hot war in the long run, but this is actually impossible. It must be understood that the Cold War was initiated because the Cold War initiator avoided a hot war.</p>
<p>In general, Cold War initiators must have many goals to be achieved in the Cold War, but it all depends on the situation. If they encounter resistance in the Cold War that is unexpected, they will stop after receiving a slight harvest. If the progress is smoother, they will intensify and demand more and bigger goals.</p>
<p>The reason why the Cold War is better than the Hot War is not only that the method is peaceful, but that it is possible to stop at the slightest benefit once it encounters resistance. However, once a Hot War is launched, it cannot be compromised halfway until victory or defeat is clear. Because of the brutality of the Hot War, no one dares to try it lightly, so there is a peaceful Cold War. Since differences between the two powers are inevitable, the Cold War cannot be eliminated. In the Cold War, the United States is using its huge economic power and solid resources to help the economic recovery of intermediary countries, so that they can become independent and prosperous, and be a stabilizing force for lasting world peace. However, the economic power of the United States is not inexhaustible, and the total wealth of the intermediary countries is no longer a force to be reckoned with. Therefore, how to effectively use this huge power is the US's peaceful Cold War strategy. The success or failure of the Cold War strategy is the success or failure of world peace. The Soviet Union is now using its only weapon to wage the Cold War, namely, thought and ideology. In the past, Gu Lian used this weapon to infiltrate the Balkans, Hungary, Greece, and the Near East, gaining widespread support.</p>
<p>In short, in order to win the support of intermediary countries, it is necessary not to force intermediary countries to adopt similar political and economic systems. The so-called international coexistence must be built on accommodating dissent, so that any country has a government that suits its own national conditions and resolves its own national destiny. In addition, international ideological exchanges, increased diplomatic relations, and treaty agreements can increase mutual understanding and understanding, so that countries with different systems can still coexist in a peaceful environment.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu reported to newspaper reporters in the city government office at 5 pm yesterday that the third ration of rice this month would be replaced by flour across the board. Sales are scheduled to begin today (22nd) and end on March 31st. All citizens of this city can purchase five jin of American flour from the designated rice shops in their respective districts with the third section of their March ration certificate at a price of 2,100 gold yuan. Those with key ration certificates can purchase it for 1,600 gold yuan. The flour being rationed this time is processed in the United States, and its quality is superior to the previously rationed flour.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then reported that the reason for replacing rice with flour was to help the American side clear out their inventory. The flour was originally intended to be transported to North China, but due to the disruption of transportation, it could not be transported. If it was not used in time, it was feared that it would be damaged over time. After the American side requested assistance, Mayor Wu believed that the city should accept the request, so he decided to replace the household rice with American flour across the board. Wu also hoped that citizens would not doubt the source of rice, as the city has sufficient rice reserves and the flour could be rationed in full this period. Next time onwards, white rice will continue to be rationed. In addition, the household rice rationing work in this city can definitely continue to be held after April. It will be decided again after the US Congress passes it in July.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, and other eight groups jointly telegraphed Acting President Li and Premier He of the Executive Yuan yesterday, unanimously requesting that Mayor Wu Guozhen be persuaded to stay. The original telegram stated: "Nanjing Acting President Li, Premier He of the Executive Yuan, Mayor Wu Guozhen of this city has outstanding talents and broad vision. Since taking office in Shanghai, he has been working hard for three years, with meticulous care. He has responded to difficulties and hardships, taken measures based on the people's sentiments, and devoted his spirit to municipal administration. He has been loyal to his oath and is both resolute and brave. He has experienced the elimination of hidden dangers and quelled major changes. Although his mind and body are exhausted, he is working harder. The citizens of the city deeply love and respect him, and international figures also praise him. Now that we hear that he has the intention to retire and has submitted his resignation several times, we are shocked to hear the news. The council members believe that Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country. At this time of turbulent situation, it seems inappropriate to change the head of the local administration. Although Mayor Wu has the intention to retire, it is not the time to take a high position. We unanimously urge Your Excellencies to be concerned about the development of Shanghai, and to grant him warm words of persuasion to stay, so as to comfort the people's hope.

<p>The City Council and other groups also telegraphed Mayor Wu, saying: "Mayor Guozhen, since you have been in charge of Shanghai's administration for three years, working hard and responding to difficulties, we have long admired and respected you. Now that we hear that you have the intention to retire and have submitted your resignation several times, we are shocked to hear the news. We have found that Shanghai relies on virtuous people to make up for omissions and overcome difficulties to have what it has today. However, the people's livelihood is declining and has not yet recovered. You should take care of the people in your arms and not be able to take a high position. In addition to unanimously urging Acting President Li and Premier He to persuade you to stay, we also telegraph to urge you to be concerned about public opinion in Shanghai, cancel your resignation, and reluctantly do your best to comfort the people's hope. The citizens of Shanghai are very fortunate."</p>

<p>It seems that Shanghai Mayor Wu Zhengleng will leave his post. When Wu met with reporters at 5 pm on the 21st, he said: "Whether it is approved or not, I will leave!" This firm attitude is unprecedented in Wu's more than ten resignations. He also said that his health has been deteriorating recently, and he has been suffering from malignant malaria. He is deeply afraid of delaying official duties with a sick body, so he resolutely asks to resign. It is reported that Wu's resignation has been submitted to the Central Government, and it can be decided after the new cabinet is formed. However, he has prepared to take two weeks of leave to rest after Chen Liang, the new Secretary-General of the City Government, takes office on the 23rd, so that he can rest. Chen will temporarily replace all duties of the City Government. After the new mayor takes office, the handover will be carried out.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Following the Case of the Corpse in the Box, Another Horrific Blood Case; Dismembered Male Corpse Found Near Qi Lu Villa on Jinyi Road; Whereabouts of Head and Hands Still Under Investigation <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A horrific and bizarre case of a corpse dismembered into seven pieces in a box occurred at the North Railway Station in this city one afternoon. It shocked the society at that time. It has been more than two weeks since then, and the case has not yet been solved. Unexpectedly, at about 7:30 yesterday morning, another case of a male corpse dismembered into countless pieces was found near the back door of Qi Lu Villa on Jinyi Road in Shanghai West, hidden in yellow tarpaulin packages and travel bags. It can be said that it is not an isolated incident. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>At about 7:30 yesterday morning, Li Changjiu, who was watching the public cemetery, discovered a yellow tarpaulin package shaped like luggage outside the back door of Qi Lu Villa (i.e., Shandong Fellow Association) at No. 465, the intersection of Jinyi Road and Xieshi Road. It was tied with white hemp rope. Then, a large travel bag was found in the nearby creek. Immediately moved by curiosity, he walked to the river bank and bowed his head to open the zipper of the travel bag. He saw many pieces that looked like pig knuckles. Upon closer inspection, they were not meat. Li was greatly suspicious and rushed to report to the accounting room of the Fellow Association, who reported it to the Changshu Road Police Station. The criminal section chief Chen Fenglin was dispatched, leading police officer Zhu Yunlin to investigate. The tarpaulin package was opened again, and it was found to be a dismembered body. It was determined to be a serious assassination case. Section Chief Chen telegraphed the branch director Cheng Yikuan, who personally led the deputy branch director Wang Sizu, the section chief, and several plainclothes police officers to the scene to investigate. It was found that the flesh in the travel bag was slightly discolored due to prolonged immersion in water, while the tarpaulin package contained two packages of limbs, a total of thirty-two pieces. Branch Director Cheng immediately reported to the headquarters and dispatched forensic doctor Dr. Liang Hanfen, together with detectives and police officers from the photography room Fang Meifa, etc., who arrived at the scene one after another.</p>
<p>It Is Presumed That the Deceased Was Definitely Not a Laborer</p>
<p>After repeated examinations by Dr. Liang, it was recorded that one part was chopped with a knife and the other part was sawed off. It was also determined that the dismemberment was after the person was killed. The body had no scars all over, and the cut of the bones and muscles was very neat. It was speculated that the deceased was about thirty-one or two years old, weighed about 160 pounds or more, and was about five feet and four inches tall. It was also inferred from the heels that this person was definitely not a laborer, and it was determined that the death period was no more than two days. The dismembered body includes (1) a section of neck meat, (2) a piece of bone under the neck, (3) a piece in the middle of the back, (4) a piece of hip under the waist, (5) a section of the upper left back, (6) two sections of the right forearm, (7) one section each of the upper part of the left and right thighs, (8) one section each of the center of the left and right knees, (9) one section each of the left and right calves, (10) five pieces of the left and right ankles, (11) one heart, (12) one-quarter of the kidney thief, (13) two pieces of the chest breasts, (14) ten pieces of broken muscles. The missing parts include the head, the left and right eyebrows, the front chest bone, the diaphragm, the internal organs, the upper half of the buttocks, the right front chest, the left and right palms, fingers, one section of the thigh, the left and right toes, half a kidney, and the genitals.</p>
<p>Lead Printed Strips in the Sleeves of a Woman's Jacket</p>
<p>The items placed under the body parts include a woman's cheongsam cotton wool strip, four silk cotton tires of children's open crotch pants, a square cotton tire, a tattered mattress cotton wool strip, a blue-faced and green-bottom cotton woman's short jacket, and a copy of the Ta Kung Pao dated December 14, 1948. A piece of paper with lead-printed characters of No. 6 was placed in the sleeve of the woman's short jacket, which reads "If people have hatred for me, it can be forgotten and not thought of." The paper strip is about one and a half inches long and about three inches wide. In addition, it rained all day the day before yesterday, and it did not stop until midnight, while the hemp rope on the oil bag was still dry. Therefore, it is predicted that the murderer moved the body to the place around five or six o'clock in the morning. After the forensic doctor examined it, the police officers transported the two packages of body parts to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. At the same time, the Tan Branch Bureau issued an arrest warrant for the fleeing murderer to bring him to justice.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhao Changgeng, who attempted to murder his brother, was sentenced to five years in prison by Judge Zhu Huaping of the District Court yesterday. His brother Zhao Jinpei has recovered from his injuries and was discharged from the hospital. He appeared in court yesterday to testify, feeling his brotherly love, and pleaded for leniency for his brother. The court did not grant his request because he violated the national law. The record shows that the defendant Zhao Changgeng was addicted to gambling and often asked his brother for loans, but he was not satisfied and had harbored resentment for a long time. At midnight on the 4th of last month, Changgeng took advantage of his brother Jinpei being asleep at home, sneaked into the bedroom with a knife, and stabbed his brother several times. Jinpei cried for help in pain and was rushed to the hospital by his family for treatment. He recovered his health. Upon hearing the news, the police station arrested Changgeng and transferred him to the district prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] On January 10, cotton cloth broker Wang Xifan colluded with his friend Hua Ziyu to forge several blank cotton cloth bills of lading printed by Beiping Shengshen Tun Zhuang Tutong. They went to the Leyuan Teahouse on Jiujiang Road for a tea party. Wang claimed to be the owner of Shen Zhuang and sold them to Wang Zhibin, Mei Quanyuan, Shen Shulin, Zhou Baohua, Ren Hanchen, Sun Jinde, and other six people, who were defrauded of 520,000 gold yuan. Wang returned 300,000 yuan to Hua Ziyu, and used the other 220,000 to purchase 40 pieces of white fine cloth, which he hid in the home of Xue Wu at No. 6, Lane 82, Beihai. After the incident occurred, Wang fled without a trace. The victims reported to the Laozha Police Station one after another, and the case was put on the wanted list. It was not until about 2:00 am on the 16th that a tip-off was received, saying that the suspect was hiding in No. 119, Zhongshan North Road. The white fine cloth was stored for investigation.</p>

As a result, it is said that important clues have been obtained, and preparations are underway to go to Hangzhou for on-site investigation. It is learned that the deceased was a soldier who married in Hangzhou and then went on an expedition with the army for more than half a year. His wife remained in Hangzhou. This time upon his return, he was dismembered into seven pieces. There must be some clues to be found in this.</p>

<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Little Zhang, it is unknown where he is from. His colleagues in the office only knew that he was a long-time resident of Nanjing and had just received a bachelor's degree in economics from a prestigious university in Nanjing half a year ago. His uncle was the deputy manager of the business department of a powerful bank in Shanghai. With this connection, Little Zhang became an investigation specialist in the department managed by his uncle. Little Zhang never understood the Shanghai style of his colleagues in the office. Seeing them set aside their official duties to inquire about the market prices of gold, paper money, and stocks, he thought, "These guys really deserve to die, just taking money and not working. I must set an example for them!"</p>
<p>But a month or two passed, and Little Zhang mixed in the office and ran around outside. His stubborn Beijing style finally began to waver. Moreover, the money he received based on the cost of living index bought less and less each month. He thought that in this day and age, he should use his business acumen. With the economic theories he learned at the university, as well as his contacts and social interactions, he was not afraid of not being able to win in the business world. Having made up his mind, Little Zhang found several gold speculation firms through introductions. He only needed to pay two taels of margin to trade futures contracts of ten taels per bar.</p>
<p>Receiving News, Selling Two Bars</p>
<p>That night, Little Zhang somehow received absolutely accurate news that the Central Bank, in order to contract the currency supply to cooperate with the implementation of the new financial plan, had decided to continuously sell large quantities of gold, silver dollars, foreign exchange transfer certificates, cotton yarn, sugar, and so on. He thought that since the announcement of the new financial plan, prices had already risen several times and seemed to have reached a saturation point. The market's money supply had approached the seven-corner level. According to the quantity theory of money, the general price level is directly proportional to the quantity of currency and its velocity of circulation. Therefore, the price of gold would definitely fall in the following days. Tomorrow, he would find the right market price to sell short and borrow money, which would be a good deal.</p>
<p>The next morning, Little Zhang signed in at the office and sneaked out under the pretext of conducting an investigation. He arrived at the gold firm. There were still ten minutes before the market opened, but the unofficial gold market was still hovering at a high level. At 9:30 AM, the market opened at a high of 3.35 million, and Little Zhang, feeling that he had found the right opportunity, sold two bars. He mortgaged four small gold bars borrowed from his colleague Old Ma. The 6.7 million yuan he earned from selling short was credited to his account by the gold firm at an interest rate of seven corners.</p>
<p>Gold Becomes Cheap, Interest Rates High: Double Income</p>
<p>Little Zhang's dream did not fail. On the day he sold short, the gold market initially hovered at a high level. Just as the market was evening out near noon, news suddenly came that the Central Bank was selling to the market through a certain gold firm, in lots of ten or twenty bars. The market price fell by more than ten levels in a quarter of an hour, eventually closing at 2.97 million. Little Zhang was overjoyed with his initial victory. He boasted to his colleagues, who praised him for having a "promising start." Little Zhang, following the trend, said, "Watch me make a promising start for two more days!"</p>
<p>Indeed, in the following two days, the Central Bank not only sold gold in the gold market but also sold yarn, sugar, and foreign exchange transfer certificates. All market prices were suppressed. The money supply was tightened to an unprecedented level, and the daily interest rate exceeded one yuan. On the fourth day after Little Zhang sold gold, he thought he had earned enough and decided to cover his position. Calculating his gains, he had earned seven corners of interest per day, one yuan and one corner of interest in two days, plus the difference between selling high and buying low, for a total profit of more than 2.3 million gold yuan. He bought back seven taels of gold at the market price of 3.3 million on that day, with some gold yuan still left over. What a great profit, how could it not make everyone in the office envious? However, Little Zhang still felt that he had not earned enough. Because after he covered his position, the market price continued to hover for two days, and the daily interest rate remained at seven or eight corners.</p>
<p>After this, Little Zhang's interest in and confidence in speculating in the gold market suddenly increased. He told people that the first time was just a small try, a little "promising start," and that the real skill was yet to come. Sure enough, in the subsequent rounds of buying and selling, Little Zhang was almost always successful, at most only having the problem of earning enough versus not earning enough.</p>
<p>Receiving News Again, Selling Ten Bars</p>
<p>One day, Little Zhang again received inside information from some well-informed source that the authorities were going to sell off large quantities. Seeing that the money supply had been loose and excessive for a while, as long as there was news of the authorities selling off large quantities, the money supply would inevitably tighten, and the daily interest rate would rise. Having made up his mind, he decided to sell short ten bars in one go.</p>
<p>The next morning, the gold market opened at 3.75 million, and the daily interest rate was about six corners. Within half an hour, the price of gold actually rose to the four million mark due to the continued loose money supply. When would he sell if not now? This time, Little Zhang resolutely sold short ten bars, immediately paying the margin for two bars. However, this time, because the money supply was loose, and rumors spread in the market that the authorities had a large remittance outflow, the money supply flooded, and the daily interest rate opened low, only about five corners.</p>
<p>Price Plunges, Loses Everything</p>
<p>Little Zhang told everyone he met: "The 'promising start' of this transaction is yet to come. Just wait and see." He planned to hold on for three days. On the first day, not only did the price of gold exceed the four million mark in the morning, but the next day's trading price rose to over 4.5 million. On the second day, the authorities had no news of selling anything, but remittances continued to flow in from other cities, the money supply remained loose, and the daily interest rate plummeted to only four and a half corners. The price of gold rose even further to 4.8 million. On the third day, the trend remained the same. Little Zhang was determined to hold on to the end, but unexpectedly, on the fourth day, the authorities suddenly released a large amount of "ice eggs" (frozen goods) worth tens of billions, the market's money supply completely flooded, and the price of gold broke through the five million mark, soaring to 5.35 million. Little Zhang, who had always been confident, turned pale. His previous gains, after calculation, not only returned everything, but also resulted in a loss of five or six taels. The two taels of margin paid to the gold firm now only had one or two taels left. Old Min, the gold firm owner, was opportunistic. Seeing that Little Zhang's margin was insufficient, he not only demanded additional margin but also advised Little Zhang to cover his position and settle the account as soon as possible! In this situation of being besieged on all sides, Little Zhang finally had no choice but to painfully close his position.</p>
<p>Fantasy of Getting Rich Disappears; Vows Never to Speculate Again</p>
<p>This was a "lost weekend." On the train back to Nanjing, Little Zhang carefully calculated the net loss of this final battle. Not only did it swallow up all his previous speculative gains, but it also dragged him into a debt of five taels to his colleagues. There was no choice but to go home and beg his wife for some of her few pieces of jewelry. He stared blankly at the fleeting suburban scenery outside the train window, and the beautiful fantasy he had envisioned was just as fleeting as the scenery: he couldn't help but grind his teeth and complain: "These damn 'ice eggs,' damn financial authorities!" He vowed that after this lesson, he would wash his hands and never speculate again!</p>

<h3 id="e83">Barber Shop Prices Divided into Five Grades and Ten Levels; Proposed Base Numbers Seem Too High; Social Affairs Bureau Instructs to Wait for Meeting to Discuss <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] The issue of setting the base numbers for barber shop prices and multiplying them by the cost of living index has not yet been resolved. The Barber Shop Trade Association has already submitted a list of base numbers to the Social Affairs Bureau. Several standing directors and directors of the association went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon and jointly studied the matter with Section Chief Xi of the Social Affairs Bureau. They proposed that barber shops should be divided into five grades and ten levels. The special grade was 1.7 yuan before the war (multiplied by 2.5, the same below), and the current proposed base number is 4.25 yuan. The special grade deputy was 1.3 yuan before the war, and the current proposed base number is 3.25 yuan. The Grade A positive was 1 yuan before the war, and the current proposed base number is 2.5 yuan. The Grade A deputy was 8 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 2 yuan. The Grade B positive was 6.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 2.625 yuan. The Grade B deputy was 5.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 1.225 yuan. The Grade C positive was 4.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 1.125 yuan. The Grade C deputy was 3.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 8.75 yuan. The Grade D positive was 2.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 6.25 yuan. The Grade D deputy was 1.5 jiao before the war, and the current proposed base number is 3.75 yuan. They stated that due to increased water and electricity costs and huge expenses, it would not be enough to maintain if the prices were doubled according to the pre-war prices and multiplied by the cost of living index, as approved by the Municipal Council. Therefore, they slightly increased the prices by referring to the regulations of the hotel industry, which stipulate that pre-war room rates should be increased by 2.2 times, and calculated them at 2.5 times. For example, if the base number of Grade A positive is 2.5 yuan, multiplying it by the 1339.36 times on the 15th of this month would result in a charge of 3348.4 yuan per haircut. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the set base numbers are too high and is concerned that it will cause resentment among citizens. It instructed the representatives to go back first and wait for the Social Affairs Bureau to review the matter in detail before convening another meeting for discussion.</p>

<p>[News from Our Newspaper] The case of Qian Xue'an being accused of embezzlement was heard in court yesterday. It is reported that Qian, in September 1946, gathered many shareholders to form Tianli Construction Company, with a capital of 100 million national currency, and a paid-in capital of 89 million. Qian served as the general manager. In May 1947, Qian reorganized Tianxin Chemical Plant. In May 1948, Qian convened a shareholders' meeting of Tianli Company and announced losses. Lin Shishan, one of the shareholders who also served as the accounting director, filed a complaint, believing that Qian used his position to embezzle company assets and enrich himself, such as using Tianli funds to invest in Tianxin Chemical Plant for his personal benefit, and that the equipment of Tianxin was also moved from the soda ash factory attached to Tianli Company. Qian argued in court yesterday that all the accusations were false and that Lin was not a shareholder at all. The court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>[News from Our Newspaper] The case of Zhang Yu being accused of enticement and rape by Huang Lihong was heard in court yesterday. Huang tearfully recounted the details of the rape, stating that on December 24 of last year, she met Zhang at the Weida Dance Hall through her sister Lifen. They began to associate with each other, and on the night of December 31, Zhang lured her to the Wu Palace Hotel and raped her. The next day, they moved to the Dazhongzhang Hotel and spent the night together. She then learned that Zhang was already married and, filled with regret, informed her sister by phone, who told her mother, who brought her home. The defendant Zhang Yu admitted to all of the above, only saying that he was confused and made a big mistake, and that he regretted it endlessly. The court sentenced him to ten months of imprisonment.</p>

<p>Police Chief Sun Keqiang of the Zhabei Branch was detained on the 20th by order of Director Mao Sen of the General Bureau due to suspicion of shielding malfeasance. The Criminal Division of the bureau is now conducting a detailed investigation to deal with the matter according to law. According to Zheng Tingxian, Director of the Criminal Division of the bureau, the secret report letter regarding the case of the monk of the Sun Temple committing adultery, which was received by the branch chief, did not have the address of the informant and had no postmark. It did not constitute a legitimate report. Furthermore, the branch chief did not follow procedures and order the Judicial Section or the police station chief to send police to investigate. Instead, he privately and directly ordered a uniformed policeman from the police station (reportedly Sun's former subordinate) to collude with local hooligans and go together. This administrative procedure was also improper. In addition, when the monk was brought to the bureau, two gold rings weighing more than six qian extorted by the policeman were found on the desk in the branch chief's office, and the policeman hid in the branch chief's inner room and dared not come out. All of this indicates that the branch chief may have shielded his subordinates' corruption and malfeasance. Zheng said: Director Mao was extremely angry after this case occurred. In order to rectify discipline and eradicate corruption, this case will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished to serve as a warning to others.</p>

<p>[News from Our Newspaper] Due to drastic price fluctuations, the price of regular meals has also risen sharply. In order to standardize the price of regular meals, the Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives from the Municipal Council, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Finance Bureau, Police Bureau, and Restaurant Trade Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter.

Grade A will use 2.5 sheng of white japonica rice, Grade B will use 2 sheng of white japonica rice, and Grade C will use 1.5 sheng of white japonica rice. If white japonica rice is calculated at 60,000 yuan per dan, a Grade A regular meal will cost 1,500 yuan, a Grade B regular meal will cost 1,200 yuan, and a Grade C regular meal will cost 900 yuan. In the future, the price of regular meals will be adjusted according to the rise and fall of rice prices.

<h3 id="e99">Wuxi Love Triangle Murder Retrial: Philandering Military Officer Cannot Escape Death <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi correspondent on the 20th] Zhang Jiming, the perpetrator of the sensational "Love Triangle Murder" in Wuxi, was apprehended in Shanghai by the Investigation Team. After being handed over to the City Defense Headquarters, he underwent multiple interrogations by the Military Tribunal. Due to conclusive evidence, he was sentenced to death according to the law. The sentence was submitted to the First Pacification District Headquarters and then to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters for review. However, orders were subsequently issued for a retrial with additional witnesses. On the afternoon of the 19th, the City Defense Headquarters Military Tribunal complied by summoning witnesses Zhang Yuting, Zhang Xiaohei, Xu Arong, Chen Chengshi, Zhang Jinxiang, as well as Wu Wenhua, the director of Dahua Hospital, and Li Zhongtang, the director of Hongen Hospital, for questioning. Military Judge Chen Shimin presided over the hearing.</p>
<p>Shouting "Ji Ming Killed Me" Before Death</p>
<p>According to Zhang Yuting, 50 years old, from Hebei, an opera performer residing at the Zhongdong Theater, and the adoptive father of the deceased couple Zhao Qingsheng and Zhang Yuyan, at the time of the incident, I had already fallen asleep. Suddenly, I heard the sound of gunfire. Someone woke me up, and as I was getting dressed, Qingsheng suddenly pressed his right waist and crawled into the room, shouting, "Dad, Zhang Jiming shot me!" He then collapsed on the ground. Later, I entered Wang Yan's room, where she had already been shot dead in bed. Because I heard that Ji Ming had a gun, I dared not pursue him. I immediately sent the injured man to Hongen Hospital and reported the incident to the Investigation Team. Previously, Ji Ming had sent me a threatening letter. Then, Zhang Xiaohei, 14 years old, an opera performer who lived in the same room with Yuyan and Qingsheng, testified that they two slept in the same bed, I slept under the table. At the time of the incident, I heard Yuyan shout in my sleep, "Dad, Zhang Jiming shot me!" I was immediately startled awake. Looking up, I saw Zhang Jiming holding a bright silver pistol, pointing it at my sister Yuyan. The second shout did not sound like a human voice, but like a ghostly wail. I was so frightened that I dared not look again. Then I heard another gunshot, and Ji Ming fled. He pointed to the pistol presented in court, claiming that it was the same pistol. Following this, Chen Chengshi, Yuting's wife's younger sister, who also lived at the Dongxin Hotel, gave a statement consistent with the statements of Yuting and Xiaohei.</p>
<p>The Murder Scene Witnessed by a Tea Boy</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wu Wenhua, the director of Dahua Hospital, testified that he did not know Zhang Jiming. Zhao Qingsheng was sent to the hospital for treatment at 6:00 AM on January 25, 1938. He was sent over after being treated at Hongen Hospital. He was sent to the operating room without registering. When asked, he said he was shot. After the wound was bandaged, he was asked again, and Zhao's expression was extremely resentful, "gritting his teeth and shouting, 'That Zhang kid!'" Then, Li Zhongtang, the director of Hongen Hospital, testified that Zhang Yuting sent Zhao Qingsheng to the hospital for treatment in a rickshaw around 4:00 AM. Zhao said, "Dad, quickly go and arrest Zhang Jiming." I examined him and found two bullet wounds in each of his thighs and one in his abdomen, with four holes on his legs. I determined that he had been shot two or one times. Subsequently, Xu Arong testified. Xu was a tea boy at the Dongxin Hotel. He said he did not know Zhang Jiming. I am here today to testify, and I will definitely tell the truth. The two actors Zhao and Zhang lived in room 12 of the Dongxin Hotel. I know all about how they were shot dead. He then described how Zhang Jiming entered the hotel late at night during curfew, his appearance, what clothes he was wearing, and how he left after the incident. Finally, he firmly stated that the two actors were killed with the pistol presented in court.</p>
<p>Three Identifications, Difficult to Deny</p>
<p>One of the witnesses, Zhang Jinxiang, was presented by the perpetrator Zhang Jiming. According to his testimony, he is 40 years old, from Guangdong, resides in Nanjing, runs a theater, and is friends with Ji Ming. Around December of the lunar calendar, they met once at the Public Recreation Club. At that time, he told everyone, "The Cultural Troupe wants to invite Peking opera actors. I can go to Shanghai and find them." Later, I heard that he had killed someone, and I have not seen him since. Finally, Military Judge Chen summoned the suspect Zhang Jiming to the court. According to his testimony, he is from Liling, Hunan, and is a major political officer in the Capital Garrison Headquarters. He met Zhang Wangyan in the theater troupe and had a physical relationship with her. She wanted to marry me, but I didn't dare to. I only met Zhao Qingsheng once. I did not kill him. On January 26, I went from Nanjing to Shanghai, and on the 27th, I went to the Garrison Department to see Director Zhang, requesting a transfer. Meanwhile, I was in Shanghai to find actors. On the 26th, when the incident occurred, I was in Shanghai. Finally, Zhang Xiaohei and Xu Arong, who witnessed the scene, were summoned to the court again. After Military Judge Chen interrogated and identified them three times in a row, it was undoubtedly Zhang Jiming who was the principal offender in this case. The department has now submitted the results of the retrial to the First Pacification District Headquarters for review. It is widely believed that the "philandering military officer" will ultimately not escape death.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Hangzhou Incense Pilgrimage: Talking About Sericulture and Farming <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Special correspondent from our newspaper, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou correspondent on the 19th] Spring in Hangzhou is like a painting. The beauty of the lakes and mountains is mixed with tourists, both men and women, especially those farmers who wear blue cotton jackets and carry yellow cloth bags to burn incense and pay homage to the Buddha. They walk in groups along the embankments and shores, reflecting their shadows in the lake. How poetic and picturesque! Although we stand from a position of appreciation to view this tranquil and comfortable paradise scene, if we further penetrate the feelings of the people in the painting, there must be a lot of bitterness and everyday life. Those farmers, they come to Hangzhou not to travel and play, but to sincerely burn incense and worship Buddha, seeking happiness for the year. Therefore, in the rural areas of Jiangnan, as long as one mentions going to Hangzhou to burn incense at the Buddhist temple, everyone will put everything aside and work hard to go. In the years of peace, for the sake of peace and prosperity, for the sake of abundant silkworm cocoons, and for the sake of abundant harvests, no farmer's family would fail to send one or two people to Hangzhou to burn incense. This year's situation is obviously different. There are not as many boats from Songmuchang as in previous years, and there are only a few people carrying yellow cloth bags along the embankments and shores. I asked several old ladies, and what they told me really made us feel sad.</p>
<p>Last year's harvest was not very good, but the orders to collect grain and conscript soldiers were unusually urgent. The grain was harvested from the fields, threshed into rice, and carried to the town to pay taxes. The people weighing the grain would either say that the grain was wet and not accept it, or they would turn the small scale into a large scale, and if the weight was insufficient, they would have to bring more to compensate. From the township to the fields, it takes a day's journey, and the wages and food of the boatmen have to be taken care of by themselves. Some people avoid trouble, as long as they show respect to the grain collectors, they can get away with it. Look at the faces of those grain collectors, they are more fierce than the bodhisattva guarding the entrance of the City God Temple! As for soldiers, those with money and power, even if a family has five or six strong men, will not have problems. But poor families, even if they have only one son to rely on for life, will be drafted. They beg the head of the village, but the head of the village says this is a public matter. They beg the head of the district, but the head of the district says this is an order from above. After bitter pleading, they finally agree, but they must pay two or three dan of rice as a settlement fee for the conscript.</p>
<p>They don't know anything about agricultural loans and cooperatives. During the spring plowing season, they still have to borrow some from the powerful families to make ends meet. Several times, it was said that the officials in the town received orders from the officials in the county to investigate and inspect, and they had to be treated to big fish and big meat. They wiped their mouths and left, and the remaining debt was spread on the poor and powerless.</p>
<p>Their houses are still built by their ancestors, and they don't have the ability to add new homes now. The big pigs and small pigs in the pigsties are gradually decreasing. The waterwheels, plows, and hoes used for plowing are all old, and the old cattle are also weak. Their only blame is that it is destined in fate. Only by sincerely believing in the Bodhisattva can they be reborn in the next life as an official in the town, or as a person who makes a fortune, builds tall houses, adds new furniture, and fills the pigsties with pigs. Then they don't have to go to the fields to farm themselves, and they can comfortably enjoy themselves. This is the only fantasy of burning incense. This year, the rice stored at home is all gone. The incense leader everywhere asks people to come to Hangzhou to burn incense, but each person needs seven dou of rice. Seven dou of rice is not a small number in a farming family that produces food. In addition, after taking the rice out to burn incense, they don't know how to live when they come back, and they also heard that the situation is not good, so there are not as many people coming to Hangzhou to burn incense this time as in previous years.</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned accounts of these old ladies, we can already understand the situation of our countryside. The people in the cities take everything from the countryside. What about the countryside? Only giving, not receiving, let alone leaving some benefits to the countryside. Under layers of exploitation, our countryside has become extremely anemic, extremely declining, and extremely paralyzed. The countryside, under layers of constraints, their ideas are also very backward. They still have the ideas of the 19th century, wanting to be officials and make a fortune. They still ask the Bodhisattva to give comfort, happiness, and joy!</p>
<p>Rural education cannot be delayed any longer, giving them new production skills, giving them new knowledge, giving them new farm tools, giving them new methods!</p>
<p>China is still an agricultural country after all. Our true masters have been silent, enduring hardships for so many years. They are about to be paralyzed and on the verge of desperation. Truly, when the nest is overturned, there are no intact eggs. We must improve all methods of administration.</p>
<p>In the spring, under the quiet and tranquil atmosphere of West Lake, many poetic and picturesque scenes are left for poets and writers to chant and write about. The above-mentioned facts should also be cited as the best material for reality.</p>

<p>Expressing Resistance to Profiteering from the Fire and the Landlords' Eviction Tactics</p>
<p>Dear Editor: We are a group of refugees who fled to Shanghai. Two years ago, unable to withstand the threat of the civil war's artillery fire, we came to Shanghai together. We worked hard and built some thatched sheds and plank houses on Liyuan Road to shield ourselves from the wind and rain. A family of several people, young and old, rely on manual labor to survive. Daily life is already hard enough. Unexpectedly, on the 5th of this month, another fire broke out, and more than 300 of our shacks were all reduced to ashes. The situation was like this: around 2 PM that day, a fire broke out in a shack due to careless use of the stove. The South Shanghai District Fire Brigade was immediately notified to come and put out the fire. However, the Liyuan Road area has always lacked fire hydrants. Although the firefighters were quick to work, the water supply was too far away, and the wind added to the situation. By the time the water reached the fire, the fire had already burned very fiercely. After the fire was extinguished, none of our more than 300 families were spared. When the fire broke out, we were all working outside due to the demands of life and couldn't rush back in time. Therefore, although the women managed to salvage a few household items, they were looted by a group of thugs who took advantage of the fire. Now we are cleaning up the ashes, but there is another message that is enough to make us heartbroken: the landlords are using various means, trying to reclaim the property rights, and drive us away. We ask, after such a great disaster, how can we have the strength to move elsewhere? We cry out for help in vain, and have no way to enter the earth. We have always admired your newspaper as the mouthpiece of the people, so we borrow a corner of your newspaper to reveal this, hoping that the government authorities and the public will give us righteous support.

<h3 id="e105">A Faint Wind Blows Across Hong Kong <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Our reporter, Zijian</p>
<p>[Airmail report from our Hong Kong correspondent on the 18th] Two shocking events have recently occurred in the Hong Kong business community: a major firm engaged in trade between Hong Kong and Siam declared bankruptcy, owing more than two million yuan in payment for goods. A fairly large-scale weaving factory was also seized by the court due to debts of more than 200,000 yuan. Sensitive merchants have already shouted the catchphrase "economic downturn," but judging from the current situation in Hong Kong, "a faint wind has blown to Hong Kong" is indeed an indisputable fact.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of a major British merchant bank in Hong Kong, the financial industry in Hong Kong is currently facing a depression that has not been seen in 40 years. The business of major banks is currently more than 30% lower than at the peak last year. In view of the shadow of the economic downturn, Chinese and foreign banks in Hong Kong have now taken various emergency measures, the most significant of which are two: (1) Increasing the margin for export bills. The imported goods in Hong Kong have now greatly exceeded the needs of the actual market, so the price of goods has fallen, even to a point lower than the margin for export bills. When the merchants cannot support themselves, the banks also suffer losses. All foreign banks have recently raised the margin for export bills from 25% to more than 50%. More restrictions are placed on importers and exporters with weak credit. In order to protect its own interests, the bank further increases the difficulties of merchants. (2) Reducing mortgage loans and stopping all risky loans. In January of this year, general property mortgages could still reach 60% of the original value, but recently it has been reduced to less than 50%, with the lowest reaching 30%. Banks seem to fear that the currently excessively high property values ​​in Hong Kong may decline significantly in the future. The number of goods mortgaged has also been greatly reduced. "Unpopular" goods are even refused mortgages. It is said that some British merchant banks have been ordered by their London headquarters to avoid pledging too many securities and stocks, and those that have expired must be paid off on time, and no extensions are allowed. This has caused a general decline in stock prices.</p>
<p>Due to the decline in import and export trade and the tightening of bank credit, Hong Kong merchants are now feeling great pressure. Those who cannot support themselves can only close down, and the two bankruptcies mentioned above are significant examples. According to an economic survey, Hong Kong's trade with China in the first quarter of this year has fallen to the lowest level since the war. Recently, the Guangdong provincial authorities have severely dealt with small-scale smuggling "water traders" in water and land transportation, which has also greatly reduced the business of general retailers in Hong Kong. Reflected in the market, tea houses, restaurants, and dance halls are desolate, and "sale" flags are planted all over the streets. Hong Kong's trade with Southeast Asia is also shrinking unprecedentedly due to competition from Japanese goods, and the weaving industry is particularly hit hard.</p>
<p>According to the Far Eastern Economic Review, there are 322 weaving factories in Hong Kong, and 132 have gone bankrupt. Of the 190 remaining, only 90 are still in operation. Other industries such as enamelware, rubber shoes, flashlights, and lanterns also feel that the market is narrowing and crises are lurking. The current expectations of Hong Kong merchants for new markets such as North China, Korea, Taiwan, and Europe can only be explained as an attempt to "find another way out" in difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>However, while a faint wind is blowing through the Hong Kong market, the Hong Kong government has proposed the largest budget in history for the next fiscal year, reaching a total of HK$180,019,370 (an increase of HK$31,014,363 from this year), with an average burden of about 100 yuan per resident. According to this huge budget, the Hong Kong government (at least for now) does not admit that Hong Kong has fallen into an economic downturn. The Hong Kong government's estimated revenue for the next fiscal year includes direct taxes, tobacco, alcohol, and cosmetics taxes, as well as food and beverage, lottery, and entertainment taxes, which account for more than half of the total (totaling HK$95,775,000). It can be seen that the Hong Kong government expects the market in Hong Kong to be quite prosperous in the coming year.</p>
<p>Compared with this year's income and expenditure, the Hong Kong government has a fiscal surplus of 24 million yuan. Adding the surplus figures for the previous two years, the surplus figure in the Hong Kong treasury is 60 million yuan. According to Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Huo Laoshi's report, "He believes that this figure is not enough for Hong Kong to get through its period of nutritional deficiency." He advocates that Hong Kong establish a large reserve fund to cope with unexpected needs. It is not known whether the so-called "unexpected needs" is an hint of a "period of economic downturn?"</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government explained the increase in the next fiscal year's budget, and strongly emphasized the issue of Hong Kong's security, so it requested a large amount of administrative expenses to expand the police force and establish the Hong Kong Defense Force. The Financial Secretary said: "The core of the budget is security." It is said that those directly or indirectly used for security will reach 26 million yuan. The highest authorities of the Hong Kong government also have a statement of "preparing for the worst and hoping for the best." Living on a small island, the people are worried about the invasion of the economic downturn, while the officials are worried about the security problem. This is thought provoking!</p>
<h3 id="e106">Jiangxi Cotton Production <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Our reporter, Liu Zao</p>
<p>This came from foreign lands to the Central Plains,</p>
<p>The sacred sound and essence are truly the source,</p>
<p>With clear feet and bright eyes, the seeds are spread,</p>
<p>The merits of cultivation and weaving illuminate the common people.</p>
<p>—— Emperor Qianlong's inscription on the Baoding Cultivation and Weaving Picture ——</p>
<p>Jiangxi's cotton production is usually only five to six million catties per year. Given the current population of 12 million, each person needs one catty of cotton per year to make clothing and bedding fillings. The existing cotton production is not even half of the required amount. Therefore, Jiangxi's annual import of cotton textiles exceeds the total value of grain exports. Looking around the countryside, how many people's clothes can cover their bodies without showing the poor image of tattered clothes!</p>
<p>Jiangxi's textile industry is now in its infancy. The Jiujiang Xingzhong Yarn Factory has 20,000 spindles, and the Nanchang Xinsheng Yarn Factory currently has 2,000 spindles and may add another 3,000 spindles in the short term. The two factories need about 50,000 dan of fine short-staple raw cotton annually, more than 90% of which relies on supplies from Hankou and Anqing. The green-seed American cotton produced in the alluvial layer along the Poyang Lake area, such as Pengze, only accounts for 10% of the supply to the textile industry. The cotton for clothing and bedding fillings in the countryside, in addition to a part taken from the province's production, is mostly imported from Huangmei and Wuxue in southern Hubei and the Dongting Lake area in Hunan Province. In addition, cotton textiles imported from Beijing and Shanghai, of course, also replace part of the cotton consumption.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Cotton Production Improvement Department is coordinating the increase in cotton production nationwide.</p>
<p>Jiangxi is now listed as one of the provinces that are self-sufficient in cotton production. Therefore, increasing cotton production in Jiangxi is a major issue in Jiangxi's economic development. In the past two years, the promotion of cotton production has achieved considerable results through the efforts of the Northern Jiangxi Cotton Planting Guidance Office. Last year, the cotton planting in Yongxiu, Pengze, and other places was affected by the biggest flood in more than ten years, which affected the cotton harvest. However, cotton farmers' use of and confidence in the improved cotton variety - Dai-Character Cotton - has been improved. In the future, Jiangxi's cotton production will enter a stage of increased production to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The results of land reclamation and experimentation by the Northern Jiangxi Cotton Field in Pengze:</p>
<p>American Cotton Regional Experiment</p>
<p>Including the main American cotton varieties introduced by former countries, the varieties selected and bred by domestic agricultural agencies, and the degraded American cotton varieties cultivated locally in the Northern Jiangxi region, a total of 18 varieties. The results of the experiment showed that the average yield of seed cotton was 165.6 catties per mu (Chinese acre). The yield of Jingzhi Cotton (207.4) catties was the highest, followed by D.P.L-14 (191.4) catties, Suining No. 75 (188.7) catties ranked third, and Huanong No. 2 (185) catties ranked fourth. The Pengze promotion species of Dai-Character Cotton ranked fifth with (178.8) catties. The Pengze degraded American cotton D531 and FOSTER 63 varieties ranked first, second, and third from the bottom with (144.8) catties, (146.1) catties, and (147.4) catties per mu, respectively. The Dai-Character Cotton has a particularly high lint percentage and its maturity period is slightly earlier than the De-Character Cotton, which is indeed a variety that can be promoted at present. Jingzhi Cotton and Suining No. 75 are early-maturing and high-yielding, grow neatly, and have a medium-to-high lint percentage, which are particularly noteworthy. Jingzhi Cotton was originally developed in the Si-Character Cotton system adapted to the cotton-growing area of the Yellow River Basin. Now it is also adapted to the cotton-growing area of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and shows excellent results. According to people in charge of increasing cotton production in Jiangxi, this experiment is worth studying and is a very interesting result.</p>

<p>The rice market continues to rise. Due to the easing of the money market, prices in the producing areas are rising, and sentiment is particularly strong. In the North Shanghai market, white rice and Pingdao rice have both risen by 3,000 yuan, with prices at 58,000 yuan. Top-quality rice is priced at over 60,000 yuan, opening at 61,000 yuan.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chinese stock market showed a trend of initial firmness followed by weakness yesterday. The money market remained loose, and hidden interest rates within the industry declined. Initially, due to the flatness and weakness of the gold and currency markets, outside speculative funds returned, and buying interest suddenly increased, causing the market to be firm in the first half of the day. Later, news came that the Central Bank was selling gold and silver without any movement. Market sentiment in gold and currency rose, and stock market sentiment weakened again. Speculative funds within the circle entered and then exited. Selling interest on the surface increased, and short sellers frequently applied pressure, causing sentiment to soften. The afternoon market still closed at a low price.</p>
<p>Yong Yarn's morning opening was buoyed by the favorable trend of gold weakness and stock strength. The initial opening was at 7.3 yuan. There was much profit-taking, falling slightly to 7.28 yuan. Securities firms sold gold and bought stocks, rising again to 7.51 yuan. Later, financial firms turned from long to short, and the market showed weakness again, falling to 7.38 yuan. Guangdong merchants took in goods again, rising to 7.58 yuan. Large investors sold off in unison, falling slightly to 7.33 yuan. Afterwards, it hovered around 7.45 and 7.48 yuan. Near noon, due to the sharp rise in cotton yarn, yarn merchants sold again, and the market surface was filled with selling pressure, causing the market to plunge straight down to a low of 7.15 yuan, eventually closing at 7.28 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks showed a strong opening in the morning. After the opening, retail investors' appetite was still smooth, and the trend was not bad. Meiya rose to a high of 2.17 yuan, Xinyi rose to a high of 1.85 yuan, Tongyi reached 2.70 yuan, Jingfu 0.295 yuan, Lianglun 1.60 yuan. Those that hit the limit up included Qinxing 0.38 yuan, Xinguang 0.67 yuan, Lian 0.18 yuan, NeiYi 0.20 yuan, and Yonggong 1.92 yuan, totaling five types. Cotton yarn was close to the limit, and the afternoon market still declined.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign stock market was affected by the rise in the black market exchange rate of the US dollar. At the same time, the money market tended to ease, Guangdong merchants searched quite earnestly, and foreign merchants' appetite was particularly strong. The morning opening of various stocks was quite quiet. Yisha initially called 15,800 yuan, then rose to 16,300 and 16,500 yuan to close at 16,100 and 16,300 yuan. Jardine Matheson: 60,000, 62,000. British American Tobacco: 22,000, 23,000. Asia: 1,500, 1,550. The average increase was half a percent.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Gold Mediocre <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Gold market conditions were ordinary yesterday. The morning market was weak and hovered. The afternoon market clearly rose and fell while including interest. It was heard that the gold and silver market would officially open today and the Central Bank would strengthen control. Therefore, the sentiment in the industry was quite uneasy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the money market was still loose and the hidden interest rates were also low. However, the bulls were afraid of being suppressed and took a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the quality of buying was light and speculative funds in the industry went elsewhere, causing the transactions to be slow. In the morning, the money market was flexible and each group thought about purchasing, but also worried that the Central Bank would sell halfway through, so the general sentiment was average. The market initially called 533, 538. After the opening, overnight bulls finished selling, and the market went down a level. The shorts took it in and raised it to 540, 543. After the high, the overall sentiment was quite soft and the appetite for taking in goods was not strong, so the market showed a decline, to 538, 541. The market had mild ups and downs and hovered at around 540, and its movements showed no major impact.</p>
<p>After that, the money market became even looser, and the daily interest rate fell to 55 yuan, but no one would take it. Furthermore, because the Hong Kong exchange rate was falling, the overall trend suddenly became firm and the purchase intentions turned strong. The market rose gradually to 551, 554. After the high, the news of the Central Bank’s sale came and the selling momentum started again, and the new shorts became active and it fell back to 543, 546, and even as low as 542.5. After the morning, it decreased slightly to 541.3, and then near noon it started rising and then closed at 545, 548 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the opening was supported by the bulls, with a price of 578, 583. After the opening it fell slightly to 574, 577. After the slight decrease, people were unwilling and the overall scene was then pushed up, and the price then went up again to 580, 583. Afterwards, there were reports of a tight money market, and the hidden virtue pushed up to seven jiao with demand. It was even heard that the Central Bank was secretly throwing gold to tighten the money market, and then sentiment turned weak. New selling on the surface never stopped. The market went all the way low, falling to 571.4, and softening again near the close, closing in the evening at 570, 573.</p>

<p>Solving the Cash Shortage and Suspending the Issuance of Silver Dollars</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The cash panic situation has slightly improved since yesterday, but the trend has not been completely resolved. The Central Bank yesterday changed its policy for banks to issue 10% of their deposit amount as cash every other day. The issuance of silver dollars has been temporarily suspended. In exceptional circumstances, the 10% limit for loosening cash can be negotiated on a case-by-case basis according to actual needs. Yesterday, it was estimated that about 2 billion yuan worth of 500 yuan banknotes were issued. Rumors that a large number of large banknotes were released were untrue.</p>

<h3 id="e119">A Stroll Through the Market: Onlookers <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Gold and Silver Market is Beneficial Without Being Wasteful; Gold Bonds Start to Play a Role; a Turning Point in the Stock Market's Future</p>
<p>For the past twelve years, gold and silver trading has almost never completely stopped for even a day. Therefore, the opening of the gold and silver market today only indicates: (1) the black market becomes the open market; (2) the illegal becomes legal; (3) the scattered and unorganized becomes centralized and organized.</p>
<p>These three meanings can be said to be the unified spirit of all the recent measures taken by the financial authorities, and can also be said to be very Confucian and Mencian.</p>
<p>Ran Qiu asked Confucius, "What is 'beneficial without being wasteful'?"</p>
<p>Confucius said, "To benefit the people according to what they find beneficial, is that not beneficial without being wasteful?"</p>
<p>That is to say, if the people think something is beneficial, the government should allow them to do it. If the people benefit, the government also benefits. Isn't that beneficial without being wasteful?</p>
<p>The current financial authorities have deeply grasped the essence of Confucianism. Underground money houses and black market interest rates are what people find beneficial, so the government opens them up. Gold and currency transactions are busy in the black market, which is what the people find beneficial, so the government opens them up. All such things are the implementation of Confucian and Mencian philosophy, and who can say it is not appropriate!</p>
<p>Gold and silver trading has gone from illegal to legal, and from scattered to centralized. From now on, there will be a bright future.</p>
<p>To what extent will this future be? First of all, it must be understood that all three hundred and sixty industries are trending towards an equilibrium of profits. From this point of view, the future progress and retreat of the gold and silver market is most likely to save the stock market.</p>
<p>The stock market in the past week can be said to have had bad luck. From today onwards, it will be easy to support each other and sing in harmony.</p>
<p>Some say: In the past, there have been markets such as cloth, so the stock market is not alone. However, when actual sales are smooth, cloth does have the function of assisting the stock market. The situation has changed slightly in the past week, and the capital required for cloth is also large, while gold and silver transactions use one tael as a unit, which is easy and convenient. Therefore, it is much more convenient to carry the stock market than with cloth, etc.</p>
<p>The most readily available thing for the gold and silver market and the stock market to support each other is gold bonds.</p>
<p>Gold bonds have been listed for sale until today, and have been in a state of decline. From now on, the daily hedging of gold bonds may be realized.</p>
<p>The authorities may have two thoughts about the daily hedging of gold bonds: (1) Sales are effective; (2) Controlling the gold and silver market also has a handle.</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, let's look at the new changes in the next week or two: (1) Gold bonds may replace the deflated foreign exchange transfer certificates as a tool for buying and selling. (2) The five jiao daily interest rate base may produce a "formula" market interest rate in the daily hedging of gold bonds to adjust the situation.</p>
<p>There is no need to say more to those with discerning eyes.</p>
<p>Now, what ordinary people are concerned about is what role will the opening of the gold and silver market have on prices and the value of silver dollars? First of all, of course, is that the tide will rise with the boat. Secondly, the price of silver dollars on the street will not diverge too much. Gold Bonds Start to Play a Role; a Turning Point in the Stock Market's Future</p>
<h3 id="e120">Cotton Yarn Market Firm and Strong; Cloth Market Inflation Spreads Again <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Cotton yarn is uniformly firm and buoyant, as loose credit is widespread. There are many bullish operators in the same industry. The Guangdong operators are still thinking of making progress, and the reproduction industry is eager to acquire the finer yarn. Retail investors also take in a quantity when prices are low. The market price is trending towards steadiness and strength. As a result, the prices of various yarns have generally increased by about 10%.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix Yarn was traded from 3.7 million yuan to 3.8 million yuan at the closing, up 400,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix was up 360,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon finally closed up 250,000 yuan, ending at 2.63 million yuan.</p>

Factory invoices for spot goods receded by 10,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was 1.86 million yuan, an increase of 180,000 yuan compared to the weekend. 16-count and 10-count also rose steadily, frequently reaching unprecedented highs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market trended towards higher levels across the board, as the money market on the market was still loose, and people's mood was showing excitement. Therefore, local stores were still eager to replenish their stock, and customers also touched the goods slightly. Those speculating in the market also took a bullish view afterwards and adopted a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>The leading fine cloth was quiet and tight, and trading was scarce. It was initially called 77,500 yuan in the morning, and after hearing that the yarn market was reporting an increase, it was raised to 86,000 yuan.

In addition, fine cloths of various grades generally increased by 5,000 to 12,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji opened at 73,300 yuan, then fell to 71,900 yuan, and turned to steadiness near the close, reaching a high of 76,800 yuan, and finally closed at 75,800 yuan, an increase of 11,000 yuan. The afternoon market once rose to 80,500 yuan. Around 2 o'clock, it went down to 79,300 yuan, and the 190 high-grade Ten Forest reached 150,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The 38th Year Gold Short-Term Public Bond Fund Committee held its second committee meeting at the Central Bank at 4:00 PM yesterday. Liu Gongyun, Chen Bingzhang, Wang Yansong, Guan Chuangneng, Zhuang Zhihuan, etc. attended, with Fu Rulin presiding. After discussion, two key cases were passed: (1) Former Standing Committee member Xu Guomao, the representative of the National Silver Union, could not take care of his duties due to his busy schedule.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Discount Committee held its 31st regular meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Liu Gongyun. As a result of the discussion, 21 transportation, public utility, and industrial and mining production business loans were approved.

(2) Those whose original loans have expired and both principal and interest have been paid off may apply for loans again, and the original review standards shall still be used for separate review and actual lending.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the money market for artificial silk showed a trend of loosening, and yarn and cloth outside the circle rose together, and people's mood was excited.</p>
<p>120 Bridge Morning opened at 3.3 million yuan, and after opening, the buying interest was still strong, rising to 3.4 million yuan. After the high, it was heard that the gold price had turned weak, the acceptance became flat, and the market turned soft. Near noon, the circle slightly decreased to 3.36 million yuan, and the next-day position was 2.52 million yuan.</p>
<p>The trend of foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk was sharp, and the public sentiment was excited. Because of the tendency of the monetary machine to loosen, the supply of funds became smooth, and the market rose.</p>
<p>The Morning opened at 3.4 million yuan, and then called 3.5 million yuan. The local market still had a strong appetite, and the market was generally rising. It was found that the high point was 3.83 million yuan, and the market turned weak after hearing that the Foreign Exchange market and the stock market were weakening. The trend of the market decreased and stopped the sell-out in time.</p>
<p>Because raw materials were rising, silk and silk were also in short supply, and the industry saw some fluctuations. The sales from the customers were big, the public sentiment was still active, and a closing was made at 1.65 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Tung Oil Rises at Close <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's tung oil market saw a trend where holders increased their offering price, since they felt that all goods were tending to follow a rise led by gold and the American dollar, and so the costs were forced to increase by degrees. At close, the market had risen from 5,000 to as much as 10,000 yuan per share. The trade was not vigorous, since international trends were still weak. New York oil was selling for only one jiao and six fen, and so the profits did not seem very favorable. Domestic sales are also lackluster, so the buying power is lackluster.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Sales for Export Tea are Low <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Zhen Zhen and Jen Yuan export green teas are very highly regarded by North Africa under French rule. Even though Yongxing and Jinlong Trading Companies tried to increase sales last week, because the merchants fought hard they did not succeed. The market was slow at first, since buying and selling were hard. Because of liquidity issues, trading picked up around noon. It has only been sporadic at most. As for prices, because of the price the transfers and foreign exchange accounts are at the prices are good, domestic trades are normal.</p>

<h3 id="e127">US Troops Ordered to Transfer; Basketball League Ends Early; Two Exciting A Group Games Tonight <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The basketball league schedule tonight has been slightly adjusted. Due to the US Marine Corps and the US ship "Pfeiffer" being ordered to transfer and scheduled to leave Shanghai at the end of this month, the McClains and Pfeiffer teams requested that the remaining league games be held earlier. The Basketball Committee has approved their request. In addition to rescheduling all of the A Group 1 games, the original Shanghai Police vs. Hai Qing game scheduled for tonight has been changed to McClains vs. Encas, while the Ren Yu vs. Hui Li game remains unchanged. The McClains team has made rapid progress in their skills, while Encas is a strong team from the Western Qing area. The two teams will clash head-on with equal strength, making it a very exciting game. Ren Yu is full of vigor, and Hui Li is also a fast-paced team, truly a match of equals, making it difficult to predict the outcome. Tickets are 500 yuan for the balcony, 1,000 yuan for the lower level, and 1,500 yuan for reserved seats. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>US Weather—Peier (Group 2C) 5:30 PM Referee: Huang Yourui, Wen Zongyuan</p>
<p>McClains—Encas (Group 1 Supplementary) 6:30 PM Referee: Jin Patao, Liu Hesheng</p>
<p>Ren Yu—Hui Li (Group 1) 7:30 PM Referee: Wang Lidao, Wu Shijian</p>
<p>The Group 2C section will begin first, with US Weather facing Peier. The foreign soldiers in that section have won all three games, making them the strongest contenders for the championship. Although the team captain, Bo Tousheng, has been promoted to the A Group 1 Encas team, their strength remains formidable. Peier has won two and lost one of their three games, and their lineup is quite complete, with Shen Bizhang, Wu Shijian, Yu Erjia, and the Hu brothers, all of whom are renowned players. There will be a fierce battle with US Weather at that time. In Group 1, McClains and Encas will meet again. This is a supplementary game for the second round. This game was originally scheduled for the previous week, but both teams requested a postponement to participate in the Navy YMCA boxing finals. McClains and Encas are both strong foreign soldier teams. In their first meeting, the McClains team was defeated. This time, the McClains team will go all out to seek revenge. However, Encas has strong players such as Buli Libotuo and Gebeng Qigu Fu, and with Bo Tousheng's assistance, they are even more formidable. Therefore, they were able to defeat the Shanghai Police and Hui Li in the second round. Whether McClains can escape this fate remains to be seen in the outcome of the game.</p>
<p>The final game is between Ren Yu and Hui Li. Ren Yu has been in excellent form recently, and their fighting spirit is particularly strong. In the second round, they defeated the three foreign soldier teams of Encas, McClains, and Hai Qing, leaving them in ruins. Their momentum is high and they are invincible. Apart from the Hua Lian team, they are the only team with a chance to seize the throne. Therefore, the entire army is in high spirits and full of ambition. However, whether Wu Xinyun can play due to his foot injury is a problem, which will inevitably have some impact on their strength. Since the return of Ye Chen, Hui Li has benefited from the complementary effect of the "peony and green leaves". Their "fast-paced" style often leads to thrilling and suspenseful performances. The three musketeers, Yongfang, Fuhai, and Zhiji, are all capable of scoring. Wei Xu has been in particularly good form recently. In order to win and avenge their shame from the first round, they will definitely go all out and fight Ren Yu to the finish.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Hong Kong Football Report <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Last Saturday's Hong Kong Football League had a total of three games. First, let's look at the results:</p>
<p>South China South Defeats Eastern Association 3-0</p>
<p>Kitchee Association Defeats St. Joseph's 4-1</p>
<p>Bus Team Defeats Kwong Wah Association 7-2</p>
<p>Eastern's Loan Players Inevitably Score No Goals</p>
<p>The results of this "Southeast" battle show us: (1) Eastern spared no expense in transferring three famous Portuguese players from Macau and Lu Hanchen, a brave and skilled player, to strengthen their lineup, clearly with the ambition to defeat the "Victory Army". At the very least, they attached great importance to this game. (2) Eastern's combat strength has obviously doubled, their fighting spirit is also quite strong, and the entire army has performed above par. Mai Xigao's defense and offense were appropriate, Lu Hanchen's looking ahead and behind, and Liang Dingtang, even though his hand injury had not fully recovered, was still as steady as ever, all of which were "remarkable". It's a pity that the Portuguese players and the brave players rarely cooperate, so the communication is not very skilled and they often miss opportunities. From this, we can see that although the outcome of a football game requires attention to individual skills, the success of the team's communication and strategic use cannot be ignored. (3) Although Eastern lost this game, the audience's evaluation of them was high. It was only because South China South also went all out to deal with them and did not relax at all, achieving a performance above par, that they had to lose. Seeing South China's defense and offense in one go, like mercury pouring to the ground, seeping in everywhere, Feng Ershu's steady command, and Zhu Yongqiang's activity, all were fatal threats to Eastern's defense. Rong Sheng, Jin Hai, Jin Hong, and Song Sheng's encircling and intercepting formed an unbreakable golden city, making the Eastern forwards, who lacked tacit cooperation, feel like they couldn't move an inch. Yu Yaode's two saves further prevented Eastern from breaking the egg. The 3-0 result was really the achievement of skill, not a lucky win.</p>
<p>South China South</p>
<p>Yu Yaode Zhang Shuling Hou Rongsheng Liu Songsheng Xie Jinhong Zhang Jinhai Xie Jinhe Tian Xiebo Zhu Yongqiang Feng Jingxiang Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Eastern Association</p>
<p>Liang Dingtang Lin Depu Jiang Shan Jing Li Qiguang Lu Hanchen Chen Li Li Dianqi Liu Fuquan Jia Hualu Mai Xigao Li Hongqi</p>
<p>Kwong Wah Youngsters Thrive Before Declining</p>
<p>The Bus team's performance on this day was not ideal. In the first half, they relied on the advantage of the tailwind to besiege for ten minutes, but they still couldn't open the scoring. It was only after the Kwong Wah youngsters marched against the wind and scored one goal that the Bus team's morale was boosted. Dahui and Chunfa switched positions, and the situation improved greatly. A series of offensives led to the capture of several cities, which laid the foundation for victory.</p>
<p>Bus Team</p>
<p>Sun Shian Tan Zhenhui Mai Linfu Feng Kunsheng Kong Qingyu Deng Sen Li Dahui Tan Huanzhang Deng Yijie Zou Wenzhi Li Chunfa</p>
<p>Kwong Wah Association</p>
<p>Tan Huanzhuo Liang Baiwei Liang Ou Fu Wu Qiu Guang Deng Ruqi Huang Ziyun Luo Dexing Guo Wentian Liu Weimin Luo Fusong Luo Defu</p>
<p>The God of Wind Dominates; Kitchee Wins</p>
<p>Kitchee faced St. Joseph's. Due to the strong sea breeze, both sides relied on it as an advantage to score points. In the first half, St. Joseph's took a 1-0 lead with the help of the God of Wind. Kitchee then turned the tables in the second half with a 4-0 victory.</p>
<p>The entire game was divided into two stages by the mischief of the God of Wind, that is, only two halves of offensive and defensive battles. It can be seen that Kitchee's defense and offense were, on average, better than St. Joseph's by one level. In the first half, they were able to operate step by step in a defensive position, struggling hard, and only lost one goal, which laid a valuable foundation for the entire team. In the second half, they were able to launch a full-scale offensive. St. Joseph's rarely launched counterattacks, and at the same time, their defenders were less skilled, so Guo Yingqi and Yao Zhuoran were able to get whatever they wanted and overcome them by a large score of 4-1.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Detailed Report of the Governor's Cup Full Game <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News, 21st] In the Governor's Cup game between Wah Luen and Western, Western took the offensive at the beginning, but it was only a flash in the pan and was repeatedly attacked by Wah Luen. But at that time, connoisseurs had already seen that Dahui was far below par. He repeatedly tried to dribble close to the baseline, wanting to cross but instead kicking the ball out of bounds. When he tried to cross for the third time, he was slightly injured in the foot because of Luo Cha's resistance. This may be the reason why he didn't perform well in the whole game yesterday, and it's not certain, but looking at his running style afterwards, it seems that the injury was not serious, but he was unable to perform his previous skills yesterday.</p>
<p>Within the first five minutes, although Wah Luen attacked more than defended, they were forced into a corner kick by Western once. At eight minutes, Mei Wu blindly charged at the goal and collided with Liang De, who was holding the ball in his hands. Although he himself broke his head and had to leave the field to put on a bandage to stop the bleeding, he was still penalized with a free kick. From this, it can be seen that the person's experience is limited, but he relies on his courage and speed. Yesterday, he happened to have the god of luck descending upon him, so he was lucky enough to score two goals. I don't see anything outstanding about him.</p>
<p>Mei Wu Shows Off His Skills</p>
<p>At ten minutes, Jialing suddenly shot hard, and Liang De saved the danger, but he continued to lose two corner kicks. Once, Zhu Zai headed the ball high on the left. Once, Li Dahui suddenly entered the center and angrily shot from 25 yards, but it was blocked by An Dachen into a corner kick. At about 15 minutes, Wu Lun crossed the ball, and Hou Lu rushed in for a shot, but Wu Lun was offside first, so it couldn't be counted. Jialing suddenly went to the left wing position, dribbled the ball straight up, and crossed it horizontally near the baseline. When the ball crossed in front of the goal, Siweia was there to receive it and quickly passed it to the front of the goal. At that time, Mei Wu changed to the central open position, and the ball just happened to arrive, so he shot into the goal from close range, scoring the first point.</p>
<p>After Wah Luen lost this goal, they immediately switched Chunfa and Zhu Yongqiang's positions. Not long after, Dahui had a chance to shoot, but it was again blocked by An Dachen into a corner kick. The ball came to Wenzhi, who ordered Chunfa to shoot, but it became a high-angle shot. At 36 minutes, Mei Wu dribbled the ball deep, and Hou Rongsheng tried hard to resist, already entangled near the baseline. At that time, Rongsheng originally wanted to kick the ball against Mei Wu's foot to make it bounce out of bounds for a goal kick, but although the ball hit Mei Wu, it rolled diagonally without crossing the boundary. Mei Wu took the opportunity to raise his foot and swipe it horizontally, and it was as if he had divine help. The ball he shot flew diagonally into the Wah Luen goal. The ball flew into the net diagonally along the right post. Because of the oblique angle and the speed of its arrival, Liang De was unable to save it. Wah Luen lost the second goal.</p>
<p>Wah Luen Changes Formation</p>
<p>Seeing that the defense had weaknesses, Wah Luen urgently changed Xie Jinhong to the central defender, Miao Zai to the east left back, and Zhang Jinhai to the front line to lead the attack. Li Chunfa changed to the left center back. However, because the trend had already been established, there was no way to reverse the defeat for a while. At 42 minutes, in the course of Si Lu's intrusion into the hinterland, Xie Jinhong and Hou Rongsheng cooperated to entangle him, joining forces to sandwich him in the center, so that they rolled into a ball and fell to the ground together. The referee then awarded Wah Luen a penalty kick. The ball was kicked by Wu Lun, but because he kicked it too off to the side, it only hit the right post of the goal and did not go in. So in the first half, Wah Luen only lost two goals, which was considered a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>When the second half started again, the Western lineup remained the same. Wah Luen's new lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Yaode Miao Changrong Hou Rongsheng Liu Songsheng Xie Jinhong Li Chunfa Li Dahui Zou Wenzhi Zhang Jinhai Feng Jingxiang Zhu Yongqiang</p>
<p>At this time, Wah Luen adjusted its lineup, which was obviously better than the first half. But after only two minutes of the game, Li Dahui angrily shot into the goal. When An Dachen held the ball, Zhang Jinhai had already rushed to him. An Dachen was afraid of losing the ball, so he patted the ball to avoid it, but Zhang also chased after him, blocking him in front and preventing him from kicking the ball out. Qi Liqi saw this and suddenly burst into anger, rushing behind Zhang and hitting him hard. Although Zhang fell to the ground, the penalty kick had been awarded. This ball was still taken by the "Desperate Saburo," who executed it with one stroke of the knife, and Wah Luen regained a 2-1 situation.</p>
<p>Reversal Missed</p>
<p>Since they had regained a taste of sweetness, Wah Luen's prestige was even more dazzling. Once, Zhu Yongqiang crossed the ball, and the Wah Luen troops advanced towards the goal, but it was finally pushed out by An Dachen. However, Wah Luen's prestige was too great at that time, and at 15 minutes, Feng Jingxiang made a wonderful shot and scored a goal, making it a 2-2 tie. For a moment, the spectators cheered, thinking that Wah Luen had this, then victory was expected.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, three minutes later, Siweia had a chance on the periphery and angrily scored a goal. Although Miao Changrong tried hard to entangle him by running, he was unable to get the position and was still cut in for a shot. The ball was very fast, and although Liang De reached out to touch the ball, it still slid into the net, so Western took the lead again. After that, Zhang Jinhai injured his foot and lost his ability to charge at the goal, so Wah Luen was unable to win again. There were still two things worth recording after that. One was that the football exploded at 31 minutes, and the other was that Hou Ziyuan came out to cross the ball. Although Zhang Jinhai was injured in the foot, he still struggled to rush up, threatening An Dachen so that he could only leave the goal and rush forward, hurriedly pushing the ball out. The ball was obtained by Feng Ershu, who immediately lobbed an empty goal. Unfortunately, the momentum was slightly poor and it did not fall directly into the goal but fell on the top of the net. Otherwise, this could have been a chance to reverse the defeat, because if the game was extended, Wah Luen might not have been able to finally beat the drum of victory, which is a pity.</p>

<p>[Hong Kong 21st Dispatch] In this year's Governor's Cup, the Western League team of the Football Association unjustly defeated several Chinese players yesterday due to their inexplicable performance. Although the Chinese team has already secured the finals for this season's Special Silver Shield, and the league championship and runner-up awards are practically guaranteed for Chinese players, and the Memorial Cup is expected to be ours, the fact that the Chinese League team, with such talented players, lost the Governor's Cup is more than just a minor imperfection. Having suffered a humiliating 6-1 defeat the first time, losing the final match again yesterday can be considered a great disgrace.</p>
<p>Considering our lineup yesterday, we had eight national team players, which is already a formidable organization in Hong Kong. Furthermore, comparing each player individually or assessing the entire team's skills, the opposing team was no match for our heroes. Therefore, we had no reason to lose our prestige. However, after 23 minutes of the game, Chia-neng suddenly showed off his cleverness, dribbling up from the left wing position, disrupting the steps of our defenders and allowing him to calmly pass the ball across the goal, ultimately allowing Meigo, who had moved to the center, to score first. Then, in the 36th minute of the first half, Hou Zi, who is usually so adept at making swift clearances, acted like an old woman trying to act young, fumbling with fancy moves on the baseline while facing the extremely threatening Meigo. As a result, he lost another goal in that person's miraculous shot. Afterwards, although the generals exerted themselves in the second half and managed to tie the score 2-2 within 15 minutes, Miao Changrong ultimately lacked experience. At that time, Silva gained possession and advanced quickly, and Xiao Miao was fiercely chasing and pressing, holding the line. However, because he didn't position himself correctly, Silva managed to flick the ball in, miraculously scoring again. Thus, the opponents leisurely accepted the Governor's Cup from the hands of Governor Sir Alexander Grantham, their faces beaming with joy. This is truly something that makes Chinese fans feel suffocated.</p>
<p>Association Chinese League:</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong (South China), Yu Yaode (South China), Hou Zhasheng (South China), Liu Songsheng (South China), Miao Changrong (Chinese), Zhang Jinhai (South China), Li Dahui (Bus), Zou Wenzhi (Bus), Zhu Yongqiang (South China), Li Chunfa (Bus), Feng Jingxiang (South China)</p>
<p>Association Western League:</p>
<p>Dosha (Navy), Anderson (Army), Luo Cha (Joseph), Qi Liqi (Army), Li Annar (Joseph), Luo Bianchen (Army), Meigo (Hong Kong), Chia-neng (Hong Kong), Hou Lu (Police), Wu Lun (Hong Kong), Silva (Joseph)</p>
<p>Miao Changrong is a rising young player with little experience in big games, so it's not surprising that he didn't perform up to par in such an occasion. The most surprising thing is that the two best center backs in Hong Kong, who were as lively as dragons and tigers after the game against Eastern the other day, were completely out of form yesterday. Xie Jinhong, returning to the left back position this time, couldn't find the same form as he usually has as the center back for South China. The most unfortunate thing is that Li Dahui was too out of form, not only completely lacking the ability to cut in and shoot, but also his powerful crosses were not up to par. I believe it's because he usually plays too much small-sided football. I always say that small-sided football can only be used as an introductory path to practicing big football. Once you play well in the big football circle, you shouldn't engage in small-sided football anymore, otherwise it will be more harmful than beneficial. The reason is that small-sided football and big football have different weights, the fields are different sizes, and the force used when kicking is different. Big football players being distracted by small-sided football will lead to the degradation of big football skills. Considering the "almost there but not quite" nature of Dahui's crosses yesterday, I dare to assert that he is harming himself by playing too much small-sided football.</p>
<p>My frank words are naturally a way of holding the virtuous accountable, which stems from deep love and unintentional bluntness. Looking at the bigger picture, although the Chinese League unfortunately lost, the fighting spirit in the second half and the quick wit to change the lineup when things seemed unfavorable are worthy of praise. The old Feng Jingxiang is still strong and plays with great skill, not only scoring the tying goal but also fighting bravely, which is truly admirable. Honestly speaking, Zhang Jinhai's center back play is good, but he is ultimately better as a striker than a center back. If he hadn't injured his foot after switching to center forward yesterday, I believe he would have turned the tide with his sprinting ability. In the second half, the entire national team forward line was brought on, but they still couldn't salvage the defeat. What else can be said?</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, yesterday's game wasn't that the opponents played well, but that we played badly. The loss was too undeserved. However, I must specially point out and praise some of the opponent's key players. Li Annar, the center back, knows the Chinese style of play well, and he himself is brave and physically imposing, making him a strong opponent for our Chinese team. Chia-neng is undoubtedly the best left winger in Hong Kong. The most unexpected thing was the agility of Hong Kong Club's Meigo, which was truly beyond our expectations. Although both of his goals seemed to have an element of luck, his ability to succeed in luck was due to his daring and willingness to act, and not easily letting go of good opportunities. Also, the sudden improvement in the performance of the two Portuguese players, Silva and Luo Cha, is worthy of praise. They also have their own way of deserving victory.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Knife Fish Noodles <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Feng Xuan, as a retainer in Lord Mengchang's household, sang loudly, "Let's go home with my long sword!" The first verse was about the lack of fish in the diet. The second course of a Western meal is always fish, and sophisticated diners even have silver knives for eating fish. It can be seen that whether Chinese or foreigners, fish is always a necessary part of a meal. Now that the peach blossoms are beginning to bloom, knife fish are on the market, and I will talk a little about knife fish noodles.</p>
<p>Knife fish is the earliest fish of the year, with the freshest taste and the most bones, so ordinary families do not prepare this dish. Last February, I went to Yangzhou on business and passed through Zhenjiang, where a friend invited me to morning tea. People in the Yangzhou and Zhenjiang area start their breakfast with a pot of tea, followed by wine, braised pork, dried bean curd threads, and then steamed buns, dumplings, and noodles. Braised pork is eaten with vinegar-soaked ginger shreds, which is naturally a specialty of Zhenjiang, but their knife fish noodles are unique to this area. The host specifically instructed the waiter to make them "thin noodles with ample soup." When the noodles arrived, there was a bowl of thick soup, and only after eating halfway did I see a small amount of noodles, which tasted extremely fresh and had no fish bones. My friend said that knife fish noodles must be eaten in February, because even though this fish is still available in the market before Qingming in March, it is no longer valued.</p>
<p>Chicken, duck, pork, and beef are available all year round, but fish have their seasons. For example, knife fish are available when peach blossoms bloom, pufferfish when willow catkins are in the air, tu fu fish (also known as yellow croaker) when rapeseed flowers bloom, shad during the beginning of summer, yellow eel is best in early summer, and its taste and quality deteriorate after the Summer Solstice, while perch is best during frost descent. Each fish has its unique beauty, such as the liver of perch, the belly of shad, the head of catfish, the tongue of crucian carp and a piece of the back under the head, the flower of mandarin fish, the fin of pomfret, and the swimming bladder and white flesh in the belly of grass carp, which only gourmets can appreciate.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Tragedy of the Middle Ground <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Feng</p>
<p>In this day and age, it's really not easy to speak. If you lean too far to the left, you'll be labeled a "communist bandit," and if you lean too far to the right, you'll be labeled "stubborn" and "reactionary." Perhaps being a non-leftist, non-rightist centrist should allow you to please both sides. However, that's not the case. If you're not careful, you'll be criticized for being "opportunistic" or "sycophantic."</p>
<p>Having read the three articles recently published by Mr. Liang Shuming, he presents himself as an impartial peacemaker, holding the Nationalist Party fully responsible for the war while also demanding that "the Communist Party should announce that the three years of fighting were a last resort, and express deep remorse for the damage caused to the country and the people." Although it's a bit contradictory, it's necessary to appear as an "impartial person outside the Nationalists and Communists." Unfortunately, Mr. Liang's masterpiece didn't win applause, but rather drew jeers. Several publications on the left, such as "Zhongjian" and "Xin Shidai," launched a siege with titles like "Questioning Liang Shuming," "Reprimanding Liang Shuming," and "Liang Shuming's Political Illusions." The publication on the right, "Xin Xiwang," also expressed opposition, arguing that "it seems as if this war was entirely a one-man show by the Nationalist Party, and the Communist Party didn't even climb onto the stage, which is difficult to accept." They unanimously considered Mr. Liang's invented "posthumous conferment method" to be a very ridiculous approach. Even Mr. Liang, who is skilled at observing the situation and trying to please everyone, couldn't avoid being attacked from both sides. No wonder the great liberal master "crossed the river soldier" Hu Shi has remained silent since flying south, truly a wise man who understands the times.</p>
<p>During the Political Consultative Conference, because both the Nationalists and Communists were vying for the support of centrists, small parties and social elites who sought survival in the cracks enjoyed a moment of great popularity, with the pleasure of pleasing both sides. With the changes in the political situation, centrists have either joined Yang Zhu or Mo Di, and are feeling the pain of "it's difficult to please both sides" and "displeasing everyone."</p>
<p>The late Japanese professor Rongjiro Kawai put it well: "We who fight against conservative reactionaries on the right and support oppressed ideas, and who fight against materialistic Marxist ideas on the left, are considered the same as Marxists by the right and the same as conservatives by the left. We may be attacked from both sides, but this is precisely where the unique mission of liberalism lies, and the valuable task that liberalism should undertake." These words truly express the sorrow and anger of a centrist.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Peaceful Resolution <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Deyun</p>
<p>I have been working in a law firm for many years, so I have some contact with various lawsuits and case proceedings. I am busy all day writing about defendants and plaintiffs, and life is almost as stereotyped as "in accordance with the above." I don't seem to be very interested in law, but I often pay attention to the clients of various levels who patronize the firm. The clients are quite diverse: workers, merchants, scholars, officials, rickshaw pullers... almost everything is included. They almost always talk to the lawyer with tense faces, anxiously and agitatedly. This impression often makes me think: there are so many disputes between people.</p>
<p>Of course, some cases seem to require resorting to law. But there are also some cases that are not a big deal, and can be resolved peacefully, but people often don't think of this shortcut, and just act emotionally. In fact, the gains from reconciliation are always more satisfactory than the outcome of litigation, which is undeniable. Even lawyers do not hope to litigate, and often mediate from the middle, hoping to resolve the matter and "turn swords into plowshares."</p>
<p>Of course, the more advanced civilization is and the more complex the social environment, the more conflicts and conflicts of interest between people increase, which seems to be inevitable. However, unwise behaviors caused by disputes often lead to both sides being injured and irreparable. Therefore, the best buffer for disputes is to seek a peaceful solution. This is true not only for private individuals and groups, but also, in a broader sense, even for wars between countries and friction and cold wars between nations.</p>

<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>In England, there is a company that specializes in distributing flyers on behalf of advertising companies, manufacturers, or other individuals. Large-scale "flyer companies" even have the names and addresses of one hundred million people from all over the world. One of them was founded by Einstein's nephew, who fled to England on the day Hitler seized power, with only a five-pound note in his pocket. Within six years, he became a big boss employing 250 people.</p>
<p>Any client can entrust the flyer company to send their flyers to people they want to reach but whose names and addresses they don't know. Although the flyer company is responsible for delivering the flyers to the designated recipients, they do not disclose the recipients' names and addresses, because names and addresses are their trade secrets. On the other hand, if the flyers are returned by the post office due to unsuccessful delivery, the flyer company will refund the delivery fee to the client proportionally.</p>
<p>The fee for sending flyers depends on the number of flyers and the nature of the recipients. Usually, it costs 48 pounds for every 23,600 copies. A waterproof glass raincoat manufacturer paid 48 pounds, but after only 6,000 flyers were sent out, he excitedly called the flyer company to request that they stop sending them. This is because his inventory was sold out after the first batch of flyers was sent out.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a soap merchant commissioned the flyer company to distribute flyers to 12 million housewives in England, at a cost of two pounds per thousand copies, totaling approximately 24,000 pounds. (Needless to say, postage and paper are the responsibility of the client, but it is also possible to pay the flyer company to handle it.)</p>
<p>The flyers distributed by the flyer company are not limited to commercial purposes. British political parties often use them to distribute political flyers. Once, George Bernard Shaw wanted to draw the attention of every member of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Irish Parliament to his "simplified spelling scheme," so he also entrusted the flyer company to send out his proposal.</p>
<p>How does the flyer company find so many names and addresses? Naturally, telephone books, directories of prominent people, address books, and the like are used. In addition, the company also sends people to read newspapers, recording every name and address that may be used sooner or later. Furthermore, they also purchase lists of participants in various gatherings, extracting useful information.</p>
<p>Once names and addresses are in the hands of the flyer company, they are sorted and classified, becoming their assets. I think if the household registration section of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau were to operate a side business, setting up a flyer company like the one in England would be a good deal.</p>

<h3 id="e144">What Kind of Person is Mrs. Truman? <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Baozhu</p>
<p>When it comes to Mrs. Roosevelt, almost everyone knows that she was a very shrewd, capable, and great woman, and a good helper to the former President of the United States. However, Mrs. Truman is the opposite, remaining silent and unknown, even though she has been the First Lady for almost four years. Not to mention that Chinese people don't know her, even Americans themselves don't pay much attention to her. In general, apart from "an ordinary housewife," there is nothing else worth mentioning about her.</p>
<p>However, people who are close to her know that this American First Lady is not as ordinary as people imagine. She was originally Truman's top advisor. During the presidential campaign, President Truman always introduced his wife as "my boss."</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman's name is Bess, and her maiden name is Wallace. She was born in a very wealthy and famous family in Independence, Missouri. After graduating from Independence High School, she attended the famous Barstow School for Girls in Kansas City. Although Bess was a daughter of a wealthy family, she taught at the girls' school. At that time, she had not yet married Truman. This June will mark their 30th wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>Because she is naturally不喜欢交际和出风头, there are fewer opportunities for people to get to know her. In fact, she is not only a good housewife, but also a woman with great insight, talent, and knowledge.</p>
<p>Although she has never given a speech, every one of President Truman's speeches has been carefully read, studied, and corrected by her first. When Mr. Truman first became a senator, Bess worked as his private secretary. Later, because her daughter Margaret was not in good health when she was young, she stopped working to take care of her child and manage the household. She likes to read, especially history and biographies. As the president of such a large country, Truman naturally has little time to read, but it doesn't matter, his wife often reads articles about world events and summarizes them for the president. Bess, like her husband and daughter, also loves music. In addition, she likes to play bridge, but unfortunately she doesn't have much time now.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman does not photograph well, so the First Lady seen in news photos is short and fat. In fact, this sixty-four-year-old lady is not that ugly. She has a small face, well-proportioned features, blue-gray eyes, and silver-gray hair that is always neatly combed. When she first entered the White House, she often saw newspapers and magazines saying that she looked like a "housekeeper." Once, she said to her friends with a wry smile, "What's wrong with that?" Bess also likes to wear elegant clothes and high-quality fabrics; however, she is very frugal. During the day, she always wears very ordinary clothes, but she is more particular about her evening gowns.</p>
<p>American government officials, senators, and their wives like to attend Mrs. Truman's banquets, because Bess is very kind and amiable, making them feel like they are at home. The seating arrangements do not have to be arranged according to rank. No matter how many guests there are, the First Lady must talk to each one. "She always talks about you, and doesn't brag about herself," one guest told others upon returning. She also cooks very well. During the war, even though she was already the wife of the vice president, she did not have a maid, just like other ordinary American families. She said, "My husband likes to eat steak and fried yams. As long as I make these two dishes for him every night, he is very happy."</p>
<p>Unlike ordinary officials' wives who travel to scenic spots to escape the heat, Bess likes to return to her old home every summer to live with her mother, driving away the guards, digging in the mud in the garden, watering flowers, or inviting her old friends to play bridge.</p>
<p>Mrs. Truman is not exactly great but certainly not stupid or vulgar. She is a meritorious person to her husband, daughter, and family, and naturally, she is not without benefit to the United States.</p>
