<h3>第三方面人士由平抵京全力促使和談成功正式商談展至八日開始</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕和談在北平進行期中，第三方面人士代表已由平抵京，向李代總統轉達第三方面人士之意見，並決全力促成和談之成功。此第三方面人士代表二人偕隨員一人，係五日傍晚由平乘專機飛抵京，彼等由政府方面之劉仲容（非劉仲華。劉仲華爲政府代表團顧問，而劉仲容則爲過去之中蘇文恊秘書，早卽在平，此次始奉命返京）陪同前來，惟爲種種關繫，記者無法宣佈其姓名。該代表等下機後，卽晋謁李代總統，面遞李濟琛，章伯鈞，張　蓀等對李代總統之覆函，並說明第三方面人士贊助和談成功之意見。李代總統當卽電召行政院長何應欽至官邸參加談話，六日午後該二代表曾外出訪問有關人士，並代送李·章·張等函件。據悉：此第三方面人士代表在京將有數日勾留，返平期未定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕據向來可靠方面消息：在平之和談五日晨開始後，雙方代表會談時，以雙方均無方案提出，在商談之技術上頗成問題，當經協議雙方會同擬具和談進行之步驟，改定八日再行正式開始。五日及六日兩日雙方代表仍保持密切接觸，研擬雙方均能同意之商談步驟，俾於八日能正式開始商談。雙方代表接觸時，空氣極爲融洽。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕關於和談在平進行情形之報道，政府方面已密切注意，自政府和談代表飛平後，由北平傳來之消息尠，然此一問題顯爲全國人民最關切者。總統府發言人第二局長黃雪邨及政院發言人鮑靜安六日已議及此事，爲避免影響和談起見，法定卽電吿在平之政府代表，就每日商談進行情形之可發表者，與中共協議後，卽電吿南京發表。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕甫自平返京之黃啓漢，昨午後飛抵漢，卽謁白崇禧，有所報吿。黃氏於六日晨自總部出外訪及，曾被此間各報記者追蹝，惟迄晚尙未獲晤。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕關於外傳中共已提最後通牒要求政府投降一說，經記者向各方探聽結果，均未能獲得官方之否認或證實。一般相信：此項傳說可能係第三方面人士來京或中共六日晚廣播新華社之要求政府向人民投降社論而起。京中官方人士，安靜如常，對和談仍抱信心，並無業已接獲最後通牒後之不安跡象可尋。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京六日電〕權威人士今日聲稱：中共已提出最後通牒，要求政府實際投降。共方主張於本星期六以前，設立聯合委員會，於三日內監督國民黨軍隊移交共軍司令部。此項最後通牒發出後，聞李代總統已通知西方國家外交代表，謂共軍或將於十日內渡江。</p>
<h3>和談代表李蒸將返京　李四一事件眞相　政院否認該案與和談發生影響說羅春波等赴各校隊調查事實眞相</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕聞政府和談代表李蒸卽將由平返京，其任務爲調查四一事件眞相，在京不致久留，仍將赴平。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕政院發言人鮑靜安，六日鄭重向記者否認和談已因南京四一事件發生枝節之說。鮑謂：和談正順利進行，六日京滬部份報紙載稱：和談已生枝節，其原因爲四一事件，使和談無法展開，然據記者獲知，五日和談正式開始後，係以雙方準備尙不够充分，故改期正式開始，此次延期與四一事件無關，官方人士對記者絕對否認四一事件對和談之影響。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕首都衛總政工處長羅春波，敎部敎研會委員沈少倫，奉派調查四一事件眞相，六日一下午特赴金大·中大·政大·劇專等校及軍官收容總隊，一方調查四一事件發生實際情形，一方並慰問各校師生及軍官隊員。據羅處長於調查歸來後吿記者：軍官收容隊隊員八千餘，其中已有百分之八十已被資遣，或分發離隊。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕京市大專學生所組織之四一血案善後處理委會，六日發表「再吿全國同胞書」，要求將血案主謀者，撤職查辦，繳回已死學生校工屍體以及失蹤工人，賠償一切損失，並保障人民自由及安全。</p>
<h3>厦大學生罷課三天</h3>
<p>〔本報厦門六日電〕四一事件發生後，厦大學生決自七日起罷課三天，通電政府嚴辦肇事兇手，並電慰受傷同學。</p>
<h3>中共要政府向「人民」投降</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨夜中共電台繼「南京政府向何處去」之後，另又廣播新華社社論「要求南京政府向人民投降」一篇，該文謂數年來中國人民之遭受內戰災難，應由國民黨政府負其責任，政府一切重要負責黨政軍人員，亦應按情節輕重，分別負担責任。如政府中之文武官員能「認淸是非，幡然悔悟，出於眞心實意，確有事實表現，因而有利於人民解放事業之推進，有利於因和平方法解決國內問題者，不問何人，均所歡迎。」否則，人民就絕對不能寬恕其罪行，彼等亦決逃不出人民之審判與懲罰。評論中指出傅作義以「老實態度」，已在開始採取「立功贖罪」。政府中人雖亦有希望參與和平解決國內問題者，但彼等現今却仍繼續與主戰的蔣氏爲伍，反對共軍向前推進，反對接受中共八項條件，反對投降，鼓吹平等的光榮的和平，此種態度之採取，實乃由於拒絕將戰犯交與人民懲辦，拒絕將軍隊改編，旣政府被人接收，甚且要求恢復舊政協時代地位，要求就地無條件停戰，要求共軍不進入長江以南，解放二億被壓迫同胞，此其目的，旨在期求保全勢力，作爲捲土重來的資本。</p>
<h3>民主派及自由派人士與中共之間已生裂痕　中共人物養尊處優住最佳旅館　李濟琛相形見絀僅得斗室一間</h3>
<p>〔聯合社香港六日電〕中國分裂份子自港赴平參加和談，結果或將不參加。據「中國郵報」載：民主派與自由派領袖自北平來函稱：各該派與中共間已生裂痕，故此輩或不致被邀參加和談。中共已接收最佳之住宅與旅館，而以次等旅館供給民主同盟與國民黨革命委員會各領袖。革命委員會領袖李濟琛僅獲得北平國際飯店房間一間。</p>
<p>論中指陳「反動賣國戰爭罪犯與革命人民之間，根本不允許講什麼平等」，又謂自日本投降以來，國民黨政府在美國支持之下，一再拒絕和平，故此筆血債，雖「萬死不足以蔽其辜」，今中共允許在八項條件下立功自贖，此乃「何等皇恩浩蕩」之寬大政策。該文之結論，謂戰爭罪犯不能要求光榮，應就自動自決在政治立塲上向人民投降，繳出武裝。</p>
<h3>政府本月支出將達八千億元</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕據悉：政府四月份之支出，將達八千億元，其中有交通事業貼補費一千億元，空運太原糧食之費用一千八百億元。</p>
<h3>金市漲跌幅度決放寬爲二成　行莊本票應當日交換</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕財部爲加强管制金融，頃對金管局指令三點：（一）行莊所發本票數額，不得超過其隔日在國行之存款，（二）各行莊之保付支票，不能作本票流通，（三）各行莊本票應在當日送票據交換所轉帳。又黃金市塲之漲跌幅度，財部決定放寬爲二成。</p>
<h3>陶峙岳出巡吐魯番</h3>
<p>〔中央社電化六日電〕新疆警備總司令陶峙岳偕政工處長梁客潯出發吐魯番　馬耆等地巡視。</p>
<h3>立院三委會聯席會　徐永昌顧祝同報吿整軍計劃　國軍員額四百廿萬不能再减　劉攻蕓稱銀元發餉無法負担</h3>
<p>〔本报南京六日电〕立法院国防预算及财政金融三委会，六日上午举行联席会议，讨论委员王广庆等所提「擬请政府速定整军计划，减少軍額，緊縮開支，核實發餉，並將非戰鬥人員裁减，節省國帑」一案，出席委員一百六十餘人，國防部長徐永昌·參謀總長顧祝同·財長劉攻蕓·國防次長蕭毅肅等均應邀列席，由委員王澤民主席，首請徐永昌·顧祝同報吿整軍計劃，徐·顧兩氏除說明整軍要點外，均說明國軍員額最低爲四百廿萬人，不能再减，但爲提高士兵之待遇，振作士氣起見，士兵待遇仍希望按照過去預定之計劃發給銀元，國防部現已確定每一士兵發給銀元二元，餘按照銀元市價折發金元。繼由劉攻蕓報吿財政情形，劉表示如軍人待遇全發銀元，每月需銀元九千萬元，如公務員援例亦要求發給銀元，亦須三千萬元，合計共需銀元一億二千萬元，財部實無法負担，且亦非造幣廠鑄造能力所及，以目前造幣廠之能力每月僅能製造銀元一千萬元，故士兵發銀元事，恐不能全部實現，因士兵發銀元最低限度這數額亦須六千萬元，此點財部頗難辦到。徐·顧·劉等報吿畢，卽由各立委提出質詢，王鴻韶發言，認爲整軍應顧慮財力，並應提高官兵待遇，採取精兵主義。葛敬恩認爲，本院不必討論兵額，應核訂預算。白建民認爲，整軍應合情·合理·合法。鄒樹文質問裁兵與徴兵是否有矛盾。賈成章主張點名發餉，非戰鬥人員應儘量裁减，並主張由國防部會同立·監兩院組織巡察團。余拯謂，整軍不是裁軍，應求精求實。雷殷說，部隊勤務兵太多。于汝洲認爲要整飭軍紀。江一平希望軍事當局會同立·監兩院及其他民意機構做核實工作。其餘尙有包華國等多人發言，並經各首長分別答覆質詢各點，最後決議「請國防部盡量採納各委員意見，將整軍方案整理，連同國防部組織法及陸海空軍編制，於最短期內送院討論」。</p>
<h3>立院經濟委會中孫越崎報吿經濟</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕立法院經濟及資源委會，六日下午三時舉行全體委員會議，出席委員鄒樹文·王力航·吳望伋等六十餘人，李雲良主席，經濟部長孫越崎·次長簡貫三·章李齡，資委會副主委吳兆洪等均列席。會中聽取孫部長作施政方針報吿，孫氏就（一）經濟部施政方針之基本精神，（二）增加國內必要之農工業生產，（三）减輕農工商業不必要限制三點詳作說明。最後，並指出過去以金融政策控制經濟政策今後將予改正。孫氏報吿畢，卽有立委葛敬恩·東雲章·王力航·吳望伋等十餘人發言，對經濟政策提出建議與質詢，東等多主張撤消輸管會，以利工商業之正常發展。孫氏定於七日下午再出席經濟資源委員會時提出答復。</p>

<p>〔本報南京六日電〕立院預算委會六日晨開會，再度商討楊委員一峯等所提「全國公敎人員待遇應迅予合理調整案」，出席委員毛翼虎等十人，袁其烱主席，委員金紹先及袁其烱均有修正案提出討論，各委員僉認本案關係重大，委員主張不一，應俟財部將調整計劃限度提出報吿後，再一併研究，決定本星期六重開審查會議。</p>

<p>〔本報鎭江六日電〕鎭江當面三江營北廿華里之奇家巷，四日有番號不明之共軍砲兵約一個營開到，附砲廿餘門，企圖不明。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕津浦南段正面浦鎭花旗營間，六日尙平靜，惟鐵路西側全椒方面共軍千餘，於五日夜突向江浦城竄犯，國軍爲集結兵力，乃將外圍之馬鞍山·伏龍山·小馬山等據點自動放棄，戰事當移至城郊附近，至六日晨，空軍出動助戰後，共軍卒被迫退去。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕據悉：陳毅所部九·十·十一·十二等四個縱隊主力，確已自江北靖·泰·揚·通·地區開始後撤，並向津浦南段移動，惟其企圖尙無法判明。</p>
<h3>安慶戰事轉沉寂　共軍再度攻勢又吿粉碎平漢綫上花園自動棄守</h3>
<p>〔本報蕪湖六日電〕安慶戰事六日晨起已趨緩和，共軍自四日夜起，所發動之攻勢，經兩夜一晝激戰，於六日拂曉前已被國軍全部粉碎，共軍傷亡達四千餘人，今竟日戰事已漸轉沉寂。據軍方判斷，除非共軍再作增援，決無再犯力量，國軍仍固守原陣地。</p>
<p>〔本報九江六日電〕安慶前綫六日整日沉寂。據關係方面觀察，共軍可能另作部署，國軍在城東郊推進部隊昨下午又推進千公尺，其前哨離城區約十華里，北西南方前綫無變化。據軍方統計：共軍自上月廿三日開始攻擊安慶，迄本月五日傷亡約近二萬人，與國軍傷亡比例爲二與一，雙方兵力則爲五與一，據情報估計：進擾共軍可能保持五萬之衆，國軍僅達其五分之一，由此可證國軍參加此役之部隊士氣旺盛，更收陸海空配合戰果之偉大。至共軍揚言在武穴田家鎭渡江一點，此間軍方判斷共軍目前恐無此企圖。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕軍聞社訊：安慶守軍四日夜在陸海協同下，擊退共軍猛烈攻勢後，一舉收復安慶東五里廟及太湖閘，並斃傷共軍一千餘人，俘共軍百餘人，國軍亦傷亡百餘人。又，共軍一部，分乘木船六隻，於六日晨二時向黑河洲（繁昌北狄港附近）守軍偸擊，戰鬥半小時，共軍不支敗退。</p>
<p>〔本報孝感六日電〕平漢南段國軍爲鞏固武漢外圍之安全，加强沿江防務，日來繼續主動向南轉進，現已撤致孝感北之蕭家店附近。阻擊續向南犯之共軍。</p>
<p>〔本報孝感六日電〕軍息：國軍因孝感兩翼及正面陣地已趨穩固，五日續棄守花園，據六日晨之消息：共軍十縱隊兩團，五日進駐花園鎭東五華里，花園南北兩端鐵路橋　樑均略遭破壞，車站成眞空地帶。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕今平漢沿綫及兩側國共兩軍均無大接觸，路東由羅山南下之共軍，仍以急行軍姿態，向花園以東河口迄張車嶺之綫疾進，路西共軍及第十縱隊大部已退集安陸，在花園西側環河西岸共軍傷亡三千餘人，經三日夜之擔架，已集中安樂城醫治。</p>

<h3>社論　聯合國大會與大西洋公約</h3>
<p>正當東西兩方為了大西洋公約的簽訂發生劇烈的冷戰之際，聯合國大會却又在成功湖畔開幕，企圖以和平方式解決世界當前的重要問題；在渴望世界和平的各國人士看來，總覺得是一件値得欣慰的事，而對於這次聯大仍寄以殷切的期望；就是出席大會的各國代表，看到了美國代表艾契遜與蘇聯代表葛羅米柯握手言歡的鏡頭，也無不報以熱烈的鼓掌，足以證明希望世界和平是世人共同致的心理，所謂人同此心，心同此理：世界和平的前途，似乎選是光明坦直的。可是東西兩方為了大西洋公約的簽訂，蘇聯早巳展開它的宣傳戰，極盡其攻擊英美企圖發動新國際戰爭的能事，並曾分別照會西方七國，斥為違反國際協定，顯具侵略性；甚至其附庸國也甘心做蘇聯的尾巴，站在蘇聯的傍邊，搖旗吶喊，也極力抨擊大西洋公約的具有火藥氣味：現在聯合國大會在成功湖畔開會，蘇聯代表決不會放鬆這個良好的機會，而保持緘默的。所以，我們預料到這次聯合國大會必將大西洋公約是否違背聯合國憲章的問題，提出公開討論，屆時東西兩方之間的冷戰，必將因此更趨白熱化，聯合國能否安然渡過這一重嚴重的考騐，也就成了極大的問題了。</p>
<p>大西洋公約的評價，竟成了今日國際間的是非。粽合蘇聯各報章雜誌與電合的意見，大西洋公約的簽訂，足以招致新的國際戰爭，其理由有三：（一）大西洋公約具有公開之侵略性質，且係針對蘇聯而發：（二）違背聯合國憲章；（三）破壞英蘇·法蘇友好條約，雅爾達協定曁波茨坦協定。此在英美方面，則力言大西洋公約是一種區域安全制，旨在防禦侵略，杜魯門總統在大西洋公約舉行簽字典禮時發表演說稱。「今日之盛典、實具有歷史性，其目的乃在使此項國際條約得以實踐其保衛簽約各國之安全及繁榮之任務。吾人所簽訂者，乃一「睦鄰之公約」，簽約各國均願遵守聯合國機構之和平原則，與各國友好相處，實行經濟互助。將來萬一任何簽約國之領土或獨立遭遇威脅時，則互商應付之道，並對被侵略者予以助力。」</p>
<p>我們站在第第三者的立塲，對於這個國際上的是非，可以說看得最淸楚最透澈不過的了。但從因果關係的角度去觀察，頗有「鷄生蛋，蛋生鷄」之謎。何以言之，大西洋公約的簽訂，足以造成國際上的堡曇，深化東西兩個世界的分裂，領導人類走向戰爭的途徑，確有造成此樓後果的可能；蘇聯方面所提出的指摘，在理論上也有其理由。但是我們要問英美為什麼要締結大西洋公約？在第二次大戰結束之後，誰不憧憬著一個世界的理想，誰不盼望世界和平的締造成功，尤其是英美的外交政策，吏傾其全力向着這個方面邁進，並千方百計，促進國際間的諒解與合作，以謀戰時盟國的合力締造和平，外長會議的一再召開、聯合國大會經常舉行，其目的乃在促進世界的大團結，而以和平的方法解決國際問　。但是三四年以來，事與願遠，國際間的逆流汹湧，因為思想的不同，利害的衝突，不僅一個世界的理想未能實現，而且冷戰愈演愈烈，使戰後的世界離開眞正的和平反而更遙遠了，杜魯門總統與艾德禮首相，雖盡極大的努力，力求對蘇諒解；但冷戰由歐洲而亞洲，幾乎普及全球，使飽嘗戰禍的世界，又到了一數驚的關頭。英美為了確保北大西洋的和平與安全，締結防禦侵略性質的大西洋公約，自有其充分的理由，是誰也不能反對的。蘇聯的抗議不免太主觀了，頗易令人回想起第二次大戰前夕的納粹德國，口口聲聲指責英法對德國採取包圍政策，而今歷史又重演了。</p>
<p>但是我們為確保本身的安全與和平起見，對於這一個國際是非，最好能採取一不介入」的態度，以免被捲入國際是非的漩渦。印度總理尼赫魯對大西洋公約的聲明，表示印度不在北大西洋的區域，故對此項公約不感興趣；同時又鄭重聲明印度具有置身國際政治集團之外的決心。這種態度，可謂最明智的了。我們希望中國輯野也有賢明的認識。</p>
<p>聯合國大會開幕後，即將依照議程進行，公開討論此一問題，蘇聯又可利用此事大駡美國為一戰爭販子」恐將在成功湖上引起軒然大波；我們站在國際和平第一的原則之下，但願東西雙方的代表都能平心靜氣地坐下來，咸以互信互忍互讓的精神，替世界和平探索出　條康莊大道；千萬不要意氣用事，為了大西洋公約而拉破了臉，使誕生不久的聯合國即遭到舊國際聯盟的厄運。</p>

<h3>經合華北主任台維斯稱　平郊糧價高於城內　農村租稅奇重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經合分署華北辦事處主任台維斯，返滬後於昨日招待記者，發表對中共統治下北平之觀感。渠稱：北平城內食糧之供應甚為充分，米價雖在兩個月內漲起七八成，但如以美金計價，反見低落。惟一出郊外二十哩，糧價較之城內竟高出一倍左右，可能由於中共之貿易公司，以火油向農村易進食糧，供給城市，故有此奇特之現象。農村之租稅奇重，稅率平均約在百分之六十左右，故農民漸有怨言。中共當局對國民黨地下活動之可能性，異常憂慮，報端日載對過去國民黨特工人員之勸吿，囑其早日放下武器自首。台維斯並稱，中共接收北平後，渠曾晤見一國軍軍官閒談，始悉此批國軍均移駐城外，編制未有變更，配備全部保持，班以上均設有聯絡官員，軍官均謂渠等乃合作一非投降。而據台維斯個人之觀察，在事實上，國軍之一切行動均不以敗軍自居。</p>
<p>論及北平之一般情形，台氏謂，中共人員紀律優良，勤於學習，但苦於缺乏經騐，有時不免流於愚拙。北平之學生日食小米，配量亦低，但對新政權熱誠擁護，且亦表示頗為快樂。推究其原因，實為中共善於在報紙上討好學生，並使此輩靑年感覺自身之重要。中共在平設有南下工作團分校，擁有學生八百人，自三月份起，原定四個月修業完畢，現則减為兩個月畢業。學生之態度不能代表北平居民之一般情緒，反對之信號巳開始發現，擁護共黨之街頭標語夜間常被塗毀·北平犯罪案尤其是殺人案，最近已有增加，共方戒備因之亦趨嚴密，每崗有三人。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕西方三强外長六日在此會議，預爲西德國之成立奠定基礎。據外交界息，國務卿艾契遜，英外相貝文與法外長許曼將於七日及八日繼續在國務院會議可能更久。靈通方面稱，議程上包括下列二要點：（一）在今後三月以內，德境法佔區與英美佔區作經濟上與行政上之合併；（二）成立和平情形下之協議，規定賦予西德國之權力幾何，行將無定期駐留德境之佔領國所保留之權力幾何。</p>
<p>自三外長於上月卅一日商談以來，已積極着手此會議之準備。國務院對德問題之專家等曾日夜從事於公文及計劃之工作。另有倫敦及巴黎方面之專家等亦被　召來此磋商。英官員談稱，「不顧蘇聯之反對，三强現決進行成立西德國之事」。在此次會議中所將討論之問題之一，卽在決定有關西德之經濟問題方面，美國應有多少權力。英國同意美國旣負担大部份佔領費及復興費，在若干問題上自當有決定性之發言權，但彼等需要對「經濟問題」下確切定義，俾在與英國特別有關之事件上，保留彼等自己之權力。例如英國反對再擴大德商船隊，而若干美官員則贊成此舉，認爲此舉乃使德國自給自足所必需者。又如法國現正圖握有較英美所認爲相稱之範圍更大之佔領軍事管制。</p>

<h3>美國慶祝陸軍節　國外一百六十萬駐軍舉行儀式　約翰遜讚揚美陸軍戰績</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓五日電〕杜魯門總統正式宣布：全世界駐有美軍之地，將於四月六日舉行儀式，以資慶祝陸軍節，使美國人向美國陸軍對本國和平，福利與安全之貢獻，表示敬意。陸軍部官員稱：目下美國陸軍中有一百六十萬軍隊將參加國外之慶祝。</p>
<p>在美國，陸軍部隊，海空軍，宗敎及公民集團將舉行集團慶祝。商店，工廠　及其他工業組織亦將慶祝美陸軍節，此等工商業組織在第二次大戰期內，曾與美陸軍密切合作。國防部長約翰遜在陸軍節特別文吿內稱：美國陸軍「平時對美國之福利，大有貢獻，戰時亦從未有辱使命。」參謀長勃雷特萊保證陸軍將支持目下在國防部長約翰遜領導下正在進行之武裝部隊統一計劃。</p>
<p>勃雷特萊稱：『因吾人承認陸軍所扮演最佳之角色，莫如在統一國防之計劃中，故吾人對於一九四九年陸軍節之主題，愉選擇一種口號如下：「美國陸軍—國防部隊之一部份—爲安全而設」』。勃雷特萊稱：本年雖爲第廿二週紀念之陸軍節，但渠將建議終止此一陸軍節。渠續稱：「蓋吾人若果因取消陸軍節，海軍節與空軍節，而能袪除此等節期所引起之競爭，則吾人不妨携手加入單一之國家安全節」。海軍部長蘇利文與空軍部長史敏頓亦發表聲明，讚揚陸軍在上次大戰中所盡之任務。</p>

<p>勃雷特萊主張　強化西歐邊防　過去保守軍畧應予放棄</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約五日電〕陸軍參謀長勃雷特萊今夜發表重要演說，透露美國陸軍當局軍略策劃之一斑。勃氏主張軍事援助西歐，及早防範侵略2者蹂　歐陸。外間現正流行一種思想，以爲蘇聯如欲佔領歐洲，無人足以阻止之，美國祗有以空軍運擊，然後領導反攻，解決歐洲。勃氏不以爲然，以爲此種軍略足使歐洲方面盟國失望渙散。勃氏茲由國務院授意，對北大西洋盟約之軍事意義，公開發表意見稱，「就軍略言，此項盟約足使歐美自由民族利用美國實力以充實歐洲防綫，對付侵略。現在兵力之均勢則集中在歐洲心臟外三千哩之美國。美國人民必能明白，我國對歐軍略如須先放棄，然後允以解放，則歐洲方面盟國卽不能爲吾助。歐洲方面之兵力均勢如寄於我國之轟炸機，其後備力量存於大西洋北岸，則除此之外，並無其他軍略之可言。此種軍畧在戰時惟有使盟國無鬥志，除非使自由世界之共同防禦計劃保障西歐之安全，則決不能望盟國人民爲共同主義而犧牲生命。據餘所知，及時投資於西歐邊防，以產生一種安全感，最爲上策，勃氏稱，北大西洋盟約爲一種保障和平之文獻。蘇聯指該約爲敵意，徒爲自身受責難之洩憤。該約成立後，冷戰卽不作爲懼。自由國家不虞在抵抗侵略時無人援手。總之該約對於美國安全意義重大與原子炸彈相仿。余以軍人身份，在參議院討論該約前，自不欲多所議論，但有不得不言者，該約與吾國之軍事力量唇齒相輔，美國人民自應聽取公僕之忠直意見。西歐倘不存在，新世界將陷於孤立」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴茲堡五日電〕陸軍參謀總長勃雷特萊之助手柯林斯將軍今夜在此宣稱：美軍之主要目標厥爲儘先編組一個高度機動作戰部隊，以防萬一。該隊將有五千人之衆，一旦發生戰事，卽可用於迅速進佔敵機轟炸美國之基地。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社東京六日電〕駐日美國第八軍司令華克中將，今日在此間陸軍電台向遠東各地廣播時宣稱：下一個「希特勒」將首先進攻美國，而不犯進攻弱國之大錯。華克謂，已往二次大戰中，侵略者先後失敗蓋彼等皆犯一大錯，卽首先進攻弱國是也。此舉不僅消耗其本身之力量，且使美國有時間將民用工業改成軍事工業。華克繼謂，美國一向不採取隨時準備萬一之政策，若早日採此政策，則兩次大戰或皆能避免。又此間之美國佔領軍，今日曾在大街上列隊遊行，慶祝美國陸軍節。</p>

<p>無論假手或假足都是中空的，假足形如長統靴，分過膝殘腿用及膝下殘腿用兩種，其裝置方法說穿了也沒有什麼奧妙，過膝殘腿的將包括大腿小腿的假足套上殘餘的大腿，用連接假足上鋼質關節的特製綁帶，套至頸間，緊縛於上體胸背，在假足膝部中央裝有彈弓，可行坐自如，且可下跪而無痛苦。膝下殘腿的假足大同小異，是用皮帶緊縛於殘廢者的大腿上。假手普通用輕木或皮革製成，亦祝斷臂之情形，如全斷者用肩膀皮帶緊套於上體，半斷者縛於上璧，其大姆指內裝有堅固彈弓，可開合自如，拈取輕小物件。</p>
<p>裝配價格昂貴</p>
<p>製造假手假足時須先使殘廢者坐或平臥於紙上，繪出斷腿之大小粗細，然後以石膏塑型，如此方可度量準確，更須依照各人身段配製吊帶或皮綁帶，在裝置時要有經騐的高明技師，才能服貼而行動自如。</p>
<p>本市靜安寺路上有一家天工洋行，專門製造裝配人造四肢，據說每一假手或假足的制造裝配約需兩星期的時間，過膝殘腿用的金屬假足，每隻約需美金二百二十元，膝下殘腿用的每隻約美金一百五十元，假手每隻約美金二百元。所以雖說是「巧奪天工」，却不是窮人所能望其項背的呢。</p>

<h3>巡視南太湖</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>「太湖週圍八百里」，這一句話與」太湖三萬六千頃」一樣的是描述太湖面積的遼闊，實際講來，太湖確是很寬闊的，她的週遭共有吳興，長興，宜興，無錫，蘇州，吳江六縣，跨江浙兩省，在太湖中瞭望，渺無邊際，猶同海洋，當然因為人的視野有限，但也可算廣闊了。</p>
<p>從吳興去太湖須由內河搭船行二十餘華里至小梅口，或大錢口，此為太湖沿岸的兩個最大缺口，小梅口為一「三家村」，僅十餘戶人家，由小梅駕舟駛往湖中，約二十餘華里而抵一小島，此小島面積不及二方里。名「小瘤山」，空無所有，僅苔蘚，野草生於石頂，野鷗休憩其上，船近「小瘤」，羣烏撲翼而飛，甚為好看。再上五十里為一大島，此島名「西山」，有市肆房舍建築其間，再上二十里又一大島，名「東山」，也為湖中物產聚散商賈交易之處，這兩山盛產枇杷，楊梅，桃子，石榴等。另有「石鼓山」，也是風景之區。如再往上行，則湖中羣峯突起，蒐為壯觀。經此而上，便可直抵無錫。</p>
<p>「小梅」當地人告記者：太湖有三十六名島，七十二暗島，所謂暗島，大概指無名的峯巒而言，其他湖底暗礁很多，一不小心，舟船極易觸礁沉沒，而且「太湖無風三尺浪」，風緊浪高的時候，如不諳太湖水性，難行寸步，據當地人講：小梅港口深度二尺至八尺，湖中深處有二丈以上，湖上交通賴商船行駛，為無錫至吳興往返，西山到吳興往返的。</p>
<p>太湖中的船隻，以船桅分等級：大槪第一級為三道至四道桅，第二級五這桅，第三級七道桅，第一級的船，是進入港內停泊的，第二三級的船停在太湖中不進港的，待巨風大浪來時，隨着這風，這浪，扯起桅帆，順風而去。這種船大半都是捕魚為生，春季捕鱘魚，夏季捕銀魚，秋冬之季捕大魚，這種鱘魚，銀魚和大魚，味甚肥美可口，為國內水產中的特產。每條船大概每天所捕的魚可以換得一担米錢，不過逢下雨，無風的時候不能捕，一個月大概要休息十多天。</p>
<p>漁民全部收入約分三項用途：十分之三用於吃，十分之四用於修船，十分之三用於祭天，他們對「天」至為迷信，以為　流湖中，生命完全交與蒼天，而能獲得溫飽，亦為蒼天所賜。漁民不在烊上留宿，均住於船內，漁民也不與外人（卽非漁民）通婚。相傳在小梅一山　有獨立樹一棵，每値夏季，有巨蟒盤樹而吼，漁民　為神佛，都燒香膜拜。</p>
<p>漁民很少受敎育的機會，因為風至時卽須出發捕魚，不能按日求學，有富裕的漁民，請敎師至船上敎十女的，不過所請的多半為舊熟的老師，不知新的科學與新的知識。</p>
<p>小梅入港漁船有一百六十條，編為一保，由王根福為保長，王自己有船七條，在小梅及大錢一帶，都稱之為王保長，王保長聲名震於南太湖，凡太湖中的舟楫，都要買他幾分賬，他的一句話，大家都相當聽從的，據說像主保長這樣的人，還有一位，在北太湖，南北太湖有這兩位，對於太湖的治安比較要好得多。</p>
<p>據太湖中人說：「太湖中根本沒有強盜，而强盜，他們都散居太湖沿岸，一有機會，就到太湖中擄掠一注，回到岸上來做寓公，擄掠的對象當然是商船之類。從前的「太保阿書」，卽是這樣的。現在南太湖總算很平安的。太湖中雖有時有打着共軍的番號出沒流動，但也沒有到南太湖來。」</p>
<p>如果深入太湖自然也會碰着了他們，他們看你陌生的形狀，也許會使你狼狽而難堪的。記者由小梅乘船駛向南太湖巡禮一番的時候，正是日麗風和，湖平如鏡的一天，據當地的人吿訴我，像這樣的風平浪靜，為兩個月來所罕有，我們由南太湖中返歸小梅，正看見一輪落日，晚霞半天，倒映在湖中一條金光，漸次而日沉西山，夜霧籠罩滿湖，在無際的水平綫上，忽然一條銀色的白色，平橫綫的圈出了廣闊的湖面。</p>
<p>太湖是可愛的由於她，使傍近太湖的各縣獲得了耕耘灌溉的便利，由於她，使數萬漁民賴着生活，我們應該使這些灌漑工程用最科學的方法讓它更趨於有利。我們應該使這許多漁民受到國民應受的敎育，我們更進一步要改善沿太湖邊岸的農村環境和漁民度着的不合理的生活。如果要這樣做，那必須要住在這太湖邊岸或是住在這太湖船上一個時期，熟悉了他們的生活情形，再加以循循善誘的改善它。</p>

<h3>陳珍珊血案　一片追兇聲</h3>
<p>〔本報西安一日訊〕陝西城固縣參議會前秘書陳珍珊被害後，其夫人為反對當地司法當局將陳案移轉西安管轄問題，撰文追兇，其原稿末段，尤為詞嚴義正，錄陳夫人原文如次：</p>
<p>中國人終算還有良心，在慘案發生之初，曾蒙廿萬民衆的支持，及各地公正的有良心有血性的人士的聲援，與各級機關對這慘案的注意，從卅六年十一月起，省府派視察王薌泉與大區保安司令慈德讓會同十個以上的機關六十名證人，經三個月零兩天的調查，把殺人犯找着了，除凶手王文德魏子玉在逃外，餘如主犯孟若侗，余仙洲，帮凶侯林斌，凶手羅天合，連成璧，雷明興等都先後落網，再經過連續的偵察，終以孟若侗，余仙洲為敎唆殺人，各處無期徒刑，褫奪公權終身，羅天合，連成望，雷明興共同殺人，各處死刑，褫奪公權終身，城固的父老們！迫切的希望凶手正法，並進一步的期望，執法當局科主犯以極刑！</p>
<p>最痛心的是判決書宣佈未久，氏夫陳珍珊停棺未葬之際，殺人犯孟若侗等竟朦蔽了最高法院，請准了移轉管轄，而南鄭高分院院長段韶九，竟不顧國法，不卹人民，不憚興論，藉移轉管轄的機會，於本年元月廿八日開釋了孟若侗，二月廿五日開釋了余仙洲，於是凶手們大肆在南鄭活動，終日招搖市上，不滅當年威風，經氏扭向法院鳴寃方使彼等歛跡，這是犯人嗎？這是無期徒刑的殺人犯嗎？這是褫奪公權終身的殺人要犯嗎？</p>
<p>氏夫陳珍珊為檢舉貪汚被害，政府破了案，交法院審訊，政府的責任不能算是終結，應當是監督的開始，不應置之不理，使被害者沉寃不白！</p>
<p>現在對本案所要說的第一不必轉移，被害是城固人南鄭高分院推事及法官均係外籍，（不獨沒有城固人連陝南人也沒的）自無迴避的必要。其次是不能移轉：</p>
<p>（一）西安因戰事影響，各機關紛紛南遷，人犯疏散，當以南鄭為安全，而法院竟把孟若侗余仙洲等要犯轉移西安，戰鬥區域，難通比南鄭更保險嗎？</p>
<p>（二）高等法院也覺西安不安，到南鄭設立辦事處，本身尙覺站不住！怎把犯人向那轉移呢？</p>
<p>（三）本案移轉西安，證人五六十名都有職務在身，在生活鞕策下，自身生活尙不能保，那有時間與經濟去做證呢？</p>
<p>（四）氏夫陳珍珊服務半生，遺下的是孤兒寡婦，是債務與負担生者的生活已瀕於絕境，從何籌備旅費呢！</p>
<p>（五）念慈縱為報仇心切，乞討追凶，而孟若侗余仙洲黨羽甚多，旣能殺害氏夫，則念慈路上安全，誰人負責呢？</p>
<p>（六）西安發生戰事，法院能保證犯人安全嗎？</p>
<p>根據以上各點，本案不惟不能移轉，亦不必移轉，而現在高院竟於移轉，則對犯人寓意包庇與便利解脫，是不難想像的特請貴報為無吿的弱者嗚寃，惠予批露，促使執法當局，為法律留一點尊嚴！把孟余等要犯解回南鄭審訊，俾沉寃早雪，生歿俱感。</p>

<p>立鍾問　友人某甲有女友乙，於三十五年間因職務上之連繫，與甲成為愛侶。嗣後卽發生肉體關係，珠胎暗結。同年夏，乙之家長令乙與丙結婚，乙乃與甲相謀逃婚。但甲以經濟所逼未果，而乙亦不肯將此事實吿其父母，結果乙竟與丙結婚，而甲乙仍以友誼相處。乙與丙結婚後，未及五月卽產一男孩。此時丙方知甲乙之關係。甲亦以實相吿，並提出認領小孩之要求。乙以丙不要該孩，允將小孩於彌月後交甲，但彌月後乙方家長以雙方皆不便留養，竟另給他人。請問：（一）甲是否可以向法院提出認領非婚生子要求？（二）如乙方拒絕甲方提出證據，法院是否受理？（三）如小孩確已另給他人應如何辦理？（四）如乙方反訴甲方强姦，誘奸，能成立否？（五）訴訟於法院他造為何人？　〔答案〕（一）甲可向法院提起認領非婚生子之訴。（二）如乙方否認，甲方應向法院提出證據。至證據是否採取，應由法院認定。（三）如小孩已另給他人，甲亦可提起認領非婚生子之訴。（四）强姦係屬刑事，應由乙出而吿訴。必須證明有强暴脅迫或他法至使不能抗拒而姦淫之情形，始能成立，至認領非婚生子之訴，係屬民事，不能提反訴。（五）訴訟時之對造為乙。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據中央銀行業務局長林崇墉昨語記者，國行確已動用自有之外匯，向美國以官價購進大量黃金，（按美國黃金官介爲每盎斯卅五美元，）現正分批運滬，以充實國行黃金庫存，而作長期穩定金　價之用。記者復詢以外傳國行近已自華南運回大批黃金之說，是否確實，林氏答稱：對此事不願發表任何意見。</p>
<h3>金市塲內擯持塲外交易活躍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日黃金市塲，交易擯持不開。因有上漲限度約束，與塲外價格脫節甚大。上午買賣觀望，迄午收仍無正式做開。午後開盤高至一三二漲停，屹立至收盤，未有動靜，僅有一大條子結交易，較上日上漲二二萬，合息二元。</p>
<p>塲外</p>
<p>塲外交易熱鬧，對敲帮進出繁忙，晨開尙平，喊一五〇萬，一五五萬，證券帮大戶出股進金，買氣蓬勃，一路升至一六〇萬，一六五萬。瀕午央行逢高有吐，暗中拋出二千餘條，散戶亦有出籠，市勢轉軟，午收步小至一四三萬，一四八萬。</p>
<p>午後因銀根緊俏，暗息又昻至三元左右，人心萎靡，欲漲乏力，開盤一四二萬，一四七萬，浮空稍有抵補，微升至一四五萬，一五〇萬，收盤又低至一四一二萬，一四七萬，較上日反跌十二萬。隔日每兩加息二二萬，喊高一六四萬，一六九萬。</p>
<p>飾金</p>
<p>昨日銀樓飾金，上午延至十一時光景，業已恢復掛牌，進一四四萬，出一六〇萬，下午未更，較上次漲十六萬。飾銀亦升三千，高至一萬六，二萬。錢兌業烚赤上午未掛，下午掛一三五萬，一五五萬。</p>
<p>美鈔</p>
<p>昨日美鈔交易仍稀，晨開三萬二，三萬四，高至三萬三，三萬五，低至二萬八，三萬。午收三萬二，三萬四。午後價格平定，開盤三萬二，三萬四，一度升至三萬六千五，三萬四千五，臨收又降至三萬六，三萬四，趨勢硬紥，較上日無甚榮辱。隔日加息四千五，喊高至三萬六千五，三萬八千五，馬路交易混亂，現鈔進出，喊三萬，三萬二。</p>
<p>銀元</p>
<p>昨日銀元套匯交易不多，華南方面，套出約一百萬左右，其他華西·華北方面，亦有一百五十萬套出，匯水每百元高至八元，低至六元。馬路交易旺盛，因時局動盪不定，各方去化活躍，證券帮錢兌帮搜求頗力。大頭上午喊二萬六，二萬七，午後趕至三關，自二萬七，二萬八，步升至二萬八，二萬九。小頭喊二萬二，二萬三，鷹龍洋喊一萬七，一萬八，較上日跳起五千。本票交易大頭晨喊二萬八，二萬九，午後每高至三萬一，三萬二。</p>
<h3>多空再度侵軋　華股平盤微升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華股市况，昨在銀根緊俏聲中，圈內幾全爲空勢所包圍，大戶雖竭力拉抬，終因支票禁止當日抵用，市塲信用緊縮，銀根緊勢雖未如前日之窘，但暗息仍站高盤，而永紗塲外貼息亦開高至一四〇元一四五元，多頭不勝高利壓迫，買氣驟减。永紗晨開二三元四角，大戶繼續烘托，卽升至二五元一角，隔夜浮多續了，塲外空勢籠罩，檯面無法支持，市勢頻軟，終以二三元九角午收。</p>
<p>中小型股趨勢尙堅，信和新光中農行極力哄托，終吿漲停。美亞景福動興開後均升，午收回疲。統益國貨上泥幕後拉抬亦見漲停。振華獨見跌停。其餘各股榮辱不一。</p>
<p>後市永紗初開二三元，塲外已哄高至二五元七，二六元二角，於是人心好轉，檯面套買旺盛，行情升至二五元。臨收塲外做價步跌，短多了售，市勢稍軟，以二四元五角收盤。</p>
<h3>退票打破紀錄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市各行莊仍多停止票據當日抵用，各業市塲仍多陷半停頓狀態中，而日前本市因停止抵用普遍實行伊始，票據交換結果，竟創十票八退之空前紀錄，各處一片退票聲，實亦勝利後本市金融市場僅見之怪現象。</p>
<p>據統計，日前交換結果，退票總金額竟逾七百億　元，佔是日交換總金額三分之一。如將交換票據中本票部份剔除，純以交換之支票計算，則退票金額已佔全部交換支票總金額百分之八十。</p>
<h3>市場散步</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>房租要跟指數走　這個道理在那裏</p>
<p>報載房租可照指數調整，是市政府參事老爺們的建議。這個消息，若果是事實，請參事老爺們站出來發揮發揮高見看，讓社會各界，全體市民，大家來評評理看。房租不應該照指數調整，本人在三月卅日本報上已經講過。本人誠屬人微言輕，可是道理應無分人之大小。</p>
<p>房租不應該照指數調整，因爲房地產是財產，不是商品。工商家出售商品，不能不照補進成本定價。職工階級出售勞力，不能不照補進勞力所需的生活費計算薪資。銀錢業放款，收回時幣値已跌；所以他們不能不把利息酌爲提高，以資補償其幣値跌落的損失。但利息並不照指數走，因爲他放出的款子，仍要還本的原故。</p>
<p>房地產出售，不能不照補進成本定價；所以房地產售價，也在跟着一般物價走；沒有人反對過。</p>
<p>但是，房地產出租；因爲產權仍屬業主，他並不要照市價補進什麼。所以房租不應該照一般物價走。</p>
<p>假使房租也要照指數走，那末他保有的產權跟着物價漲；房租也跟着物價漲。等於賣出貨物不交貨，反源源不斷地照市向買客索取漲價利益，天下那裏有這種道理？請敎市參事老爺們，你們建議房租照指數走，倒底根據什麼道理而來？讓我們來「學習」「學習」看！</p>
<p>假使不談理，只談事實，且作爲理論和事實可以各不相關。那末，就講事實罷！</p>
<p>第一：先講公平不公平。物價高漲中，工商界賣出雖是漲，買進也是漲；漲進同時漲出，所以工商界只有賬面資產好看，並無漲價實利可言。過去的房地產業，和一般工商業一樣，但房租若照指數走，那就大不相同了。非特賬面資產跟着房地產漲價而激增，租金收入也跟着物價比例增收。不啻獨許他們獲得二重利益，容許他們獨特的獲得通貨膨脹中的實在暴利；若謂此係公平，天下寗有此理！</p>
<p>第二：再講房客們負得起負不起。物價漲，工商界漲進也漲出，工資高，利息高，家家活不落。負擔的房租，若然再跟物價走，等於不讓他們苟延殘喘，一舉勒死他們。至於一般市民，收入的薪資雖跟指數走，付出的生活費照物價走。指數比物價落後，所以個個入不敷出，苦不堪言。請敎參事老爺，爲什麼不替全市工商界及市民們想想，爲什麼獨是要替大房東出力呢？上海全市不下五六百萬人口，大房東最多不過二三千人。參事老爺們何樂爲最少數人獻智計？又何樂幹此「損不足而富有餘」的勾當呢？</p>
<p>兩重暴利不該應刦貧濟富嘸良心</p>
<h3>紗布聯合外銷計劃　一俟通過即付實施</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會鑒於日本棉製品，在南洋及印度市塲大量傾銷，致紗布外銷價格，日趨低落，且難於銷售。爲謀挽救目前危機，奠定外銷永久基礎起見，擬聯合國民營大小各廠，組織聯合外銷機構，俾在各廠通力合作，大量製造之原則下，求謀單位成本之消减。同時研求技術上之進步，以其製品能適合國外市塲之需要。並爲求進行順利計，希望政府予以鼓勵與協助。</p>
<p>此項計劃，現僅擬定草案，須待全體同業商討後，始得付諸實施。關於報載一部份，同業認爲有大廠剝奪小廠權利之趨勢，諒係出於臆測之誤會。因聯合發展外銷爲一事，代紡美援棉爲又一事，二者不能混爲一談。</p>
<p>至美援棉如何公平分配，有美援會及經合分署主管其事，絕非外銷機構所能擅作主張。故聯合外銷機構成立後，對於各廠原來所得美援棉之配額，當不受任何影響。據聞該項草案，正由該會國民營會員初步審議中云。</p>
<h3>棉紗無法交易</h3>
<p>棉紗市塲因隔日票據退票及了結貼息糾紛，迄今尙未全部解決，故交易無法展開，惟二一支雙馬畧有喊開，價爲五百五十萬元。</p>
<h3>布市陷於停頓</h3>
<p>昨日布市陷於停頓狀態，該市塲方面晨初通告各同業，對成交貨款一律以現鈔或本票爲限，如以支票收解而引起糾紛，則公會當局不負任何責任，故交易未有做開。至於塲外確有喊開，計龍頭細布二十萬元，四君子元嗶嘰十八萬五千元，但實際成交寥寥，民營廠仍未開貨，門莊批發亦甚淸閒。</p>
<h3>中紡售紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡建公司昨仍循例售紗，結果僅一戶申請，請購四二支雙股紅寳光一件，價九九〇萬元。</p>
<p>又中央銀行本週一委託紡建公司所拋售之棉　紗六百餘件，經雙方洽定於昨日付款者，照週一成交價加一成，惟昨日仍未能全部付訖，再經洽定於今日付款者，則照週一成交價加一成六。</p>
<h3>塲內分三種價格　食米昨買賣淸淡　做價均未超過十七萬限度</h3>
<p>米市春假已過，昨日恢復交易，但因支票不能當日抵用，故賣買雙方均抱觀望，交易淸稀，價未超過十七萬限度，塲內有支票及本票現鈔三種價格，白粳支票價十六萬八千元，薄稻十六萬九千元，早稻十六萬六千元，各較假前漲一萬餘元。本票價較支票低，現鈔價再較本票低。南北二市塲到貨共計一四〇三二石。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>昨開始交易，因支票當日不抵用，故交易大都以本票居多，亦有支票交易者，成交殊少。豆油八十五萬元，生菜油七十五萬元，各較假前漲八九萬元，頡桶生油九十萬及八十八萬，畧漲四萬，豆餅升八九千，出甚少。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>市勢轉疲，緣因票據不能當日抵用，市塲本票不敷應用，且銀根仍緊，貨主無法脫手，市勢由高峯一路下瀉，老車最高六萬五，收市退守六關，兵船一度升做六萬二，後市跌進六關，以五萬七千七百元成交，較上週六雖見上漲，惟較圈外各物，或拆息計算，則跌得慘矣。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>市塲支票本票紛飛，交易凌亂，黃豆約較上週六挺升二成，九江冬豆以十五萬元支票成交，生仁供求兩稀，成交不足百包，價格亦挺二成。苞米微秀一成，全部支票交易，芝麻做開不多，紅糧做七萬三千元。</p>
<h3>配售台糖貨款　處理手續決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第卅六期台糖貨款，以票據不能當日抵用結果，業由台糖公司與糖業公會洽定處理辦法如次：（一）如本票退票，由台糖公司於本月七日，通知中國銀行將原票再行交換，如時間不及，於本月七日將卽期本票解繳中國銀行。（二）如原票於本月七日收到後，由各客戶補繳行莊本票，糖價每市擔二萬金圓。（三）如本月七日再度退票，或未解繳貨款，則以後停止配售。</p>

<h3>女子籃球術</h3>
<p>— 戚公譯述</p>
<p>申論進攻之法</p>
<p>上輯是闡明女子籃球所採用之移動區域防禦制和各種基本陣式，在防禦戰術上之得到有顯著之進步，這是年來外國指導研究的收獲；但有進步之防禦戰術，亦同時有進步之進攻陣式來攻破防禦之陣式的。何况：「進攻就是最佳之防禦，」一隊球隊，縱然是有極堅固之防術堡壘，若前鋒沒有銳利之攻勢，則不易减輕遭受敵鋒進攻之威脅；前鋒雖得分亦不及後防失分之多，致得不膛的，故沒有一隊善守而不善攻失球隊能穩操勝券的。</p>
<p>兵法云：「善攻者，敵不知其所守，又云：攻是守之基，守是攻之策；—微乎微乎，至於無形；神乎神乎，至於無聲，故能爲敵之司命」這是說要保持着全局之主動控制，當然要有穩健之防衛，更須要有精巧之進攻，善攻者能使敵之一合一離，一聚一散，陰其謀，密其機，我得處處採取主動，運籌帷幄於鑰匙孔眼圈之前，決勝負於重要區域籃圈之下，這是一隊成熟的球隊才能够在進攻上採用戰術之打法，倘若一隊未成熟的球隊連簡單之烟幕打法都未能運用到純熟，基本動作還未正確，就妄去作戰術之打法，這無異是畫虎不成反類犬。</p>
<p>環顧滬上諸女隊，祇有綠隊是一隊成熟的隊伍，經有運用戰術的資格，其他數隊若能有純熟的簡單烟幕打法演出，已屬難能可貴；致談戰術之練習，知之非艱而是行之維艱，就以仁餘爲例，練習S.One.的一套戰術經已兩年，仍未能如意地運用，可見得練習一套戰術必須經過長時間的練習，倘若是一曝十寒，其結果是進寸而退尺。</p>
<p>美國美芝根大學的女子籃球指導（MILIDRED　E.AND　ERSON）美爾特烈安徒遜氏對於女子籃球之進攻戰術有深切之研究。他說：近來女子籃球隊在防禦上之區域防禦制有着顯著之進步，故球隊在進攻時必須有更默契之聯絡與各種方式之凖繩投籃技巧才能攻破進步的移動區域防禦制，若果單純靠前鋒來採取攻勢是不是以攻破對方之防守陣式，在進攻時必須要由守衛得球能迅速地傳過中綫去才能配合諸鋒來採取有效之攻勢。</p>
<p>每一隊球隊之球員若果個別沒有精巧之技巧，採用攻勢的絕不易收到良好之效果；球員倘　若是不精控球和搶不到籃下球，無異是削弱本隊之攻勢，沒有純熟的地扳攻夫和守衛者未能迅捷地將球傳過中綫，亦未能使前鋒之攻勢增强的。</p>
<p>安徒遜在文內闡明球隊之基本技巧，球隊倘能運用嫻熟，謹記在心可能使前鋒與守衛者有機巧靈敏地合作來加速着攻勢，下列之基本技巧是無論採用男子規則或女子規則的打法都適用。（未完·A）</p>
<h3>港銀牌足球決賽　驚險動人　延長期內南南搶得冠軍　傑志曾以三比一佔優勢</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕艷陽高照下，衣香鬚影裏，快活谷中又是一番車如流水人似龍的景象，原來是特別銀牌甲乙組決賽的佳日，無怪香港會塲中，竟是萬頭鑽動，座無虛席子。</p>
<p>甲組決賽在四時演出。南南除了宋靈聖仍在養傷中而沒有參戰外，因「和平輪事件」而滯留廣州的朱永强和謝錦河也依時趕來，而佈成最完整的陣容；傑志方面，除了「盲眼老虎」趙富退休，也以極强的人選出戰。比賽的結果，南南雖仍以長勝軍的雄姿在加時再賽中以三比三奪得了本屆銀牌，但是曾經過了一比三的絕對劣勢，和無限驚險的過程；傑志這一敗，是在於缺乏最後掙扎的努力。</p>
<p>說句公道　話，南華這仗勝了，實在沒有良好的演出。前鋒推進遲滯，和射門起脚慢，與缺乏勇於衝刺的人物，都是「長勝軍」的絕大瑕疵，我想來南華如不幸有敗仗的。必是這缺點沒有改進的憾事。</p>
<p>所以，傑志昨天曾在全軍戰意銳盛的初期，以三比一的紀錄佔先，完全是能拚敢衝，把逞空間的戰果，可惜在下半塲將完塲前的十分鐘，給南南兩次在空門得利而迫成了和局，在加時再賽下，又喪失了先前的鬥志，而竟把光榮燦爛的冠軍寳座交臂失之，退居了次席，眞敎觀衆爲之拍「脾」嘆息！</p>
<p>當南南輸了一比三，而在久攻不逞，看看快將完塲的時候，不但看客們以爲傑志可穩保勝利，卽南南全軍也多岌岌自危，而意冷心灰地踢得懶洋洋的，但卒能在最後的十分鐘裏迫成了和局，更在加時的十分鐘前多進二球而奠定勝局，也表現了他們沉着不亂的過人經騐。</p>
<p>我願南南健兒都能緊記華聯隊在紀念盃僅勝陸軍，督憲盃敗於西聯的敎訓，在這一戰，不但不値得因勝利而張狂，而且更當虛心的檢討得「失」，這關乎未來前途的忠吿，希望南南自勉！</p>
<p>爲了加强這一仗的戰鬥力，傑志有退休多時的朱「帮辦」，「黑仔」仍然上陣。請看雙方軍容：</p>
<p>南華南</p>
<p>餘耀德</p>
<p>張樹陵　侯榕生</p>
<p>劉松生　　謝錦洪　張金海</p>
<p>謝錦河　黎兆榮　朱永強　馮景祥　何應芬</p>
<p>傑志會</p>
<p>朱兆恒</p>
<p>莫錦松　震耀華</p>
<p>羅偉權　游華興　李炳照</p>
<p>黃景聰　姚卓然　　郭英祺　張松根　鄧廣森</p>
<p>南南先失十二碼</p>
<p>開賽後，雙方互有攻守，至五分鐘，「阿蟹」得機侵入，樹陵未能拑制他的衝刺，被他切入禁區，錦洪看見情勢危急，從後面絆倒他，被　罰十二碼極刑，「辣椒仔」當劊子手，狠命一脚，「　德」雖以右手擋着，但來勢過　，仍被鑽進網裏，傑志卽以一比〇佔先。</p>
<p>南南不甘損失，大舉反攻，酣戰多時，錦河騙過「大種狗」，一脚交到右邊，看來快要出界了，「二叔」上一頭頂回門前，朱仔衝前再頂，「老朱」雖及時以手拍出，又被朱仔再加一脚，球卽如箭般直進網衣，「帮辦」不是三头六臂的，祗好暂让南南打回一对一和局。</p>
<p>傑志三比一佔先</p>
<p>「阿蟹」杀得性起，又来兴波助澜，树陵那里抵禦得来，祇见他一腳美妙传中，松根欲射漏踢，「靓德」视线还未离开松根，就被英祺以迅雷腳法，猛射中網，至是傑志又以二比一佔先。</p>
<p>下半塲赛去多时，又见卓然得球　，盤上南华腹　地，谢侯两将双双来斗，仍被他从隙空间，衝近射球进網，三比一傑志「狂欢」！</p>
<p>南南越战越乱，看看局势将定了，到完塲前十分鐘，祇见朱仔在中塲夺得阿斗，乘傑志后防空虚，单刀锐进，「老朱」弃城衝出，朱仔机警的看凖去路，等「老朱」衝近时，轻轻的把球　向空门一送，而追回了二对三的比数</p>
<p>黎兆荣追成和局</p>
<p>南南胜回这球，战意才蓬勃过来，祇见又来一阵团攻，锦河妙传中路，朱仔近门猛射，被兆恒２擋出不远，落在佛爷腳下，「佛爷」面对「空门」，不慌不忙，把寳贝送了进去，打成了三比三和局后，九十分鐘的赛事，不久也就完了。</p>
<p>球　证随着鳴笛加時再賽，松根傷足不出，傑志起初祇得十人應戰，南南乘機來襲，朱仔在底綫傳中，金海衝上一撥而入。南華立以四比三反敗爲勝。</p>
<p>傑志負回此球，張松根隨卽復入，但英祺却退守後防，叫金松開上火綫，以爲拑制「二叔」的活動，豈料無濟於事，反今前綫形成「無帥之軍，而南南爲增强衝刺力，却調金海領軍，應芬退守。距離勝這球還不及三分鐘的時間，又見金海衝進傑志心臟地帶，在左方無可發射的角度下，仍以右足踢球，在右邊竄入，完成了五比三的勝局。</p>
<p>下十分鐘換塲再戰，雙方已經疲倦到無可再戰了，祇是來「慢動作」的在拖延時間吧了。</p>
<p>加時賽程完畢，兩面銀牌由足球總會主席　士夫人頒給甲乙組的冠軍隊長，並頒與甲組亞軍白銀盃，及四隊參戰健兒各紀念章一枚，由南南余耀德献回鲜花一束与摩士夫人，及全体健儿三呼后，此本届甲乙组特别银牌决赛，便在暮色苍茫中结束了。（青郞）</p>
<h3>巴士獲乙組銀牌　三比一氣走南華</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕乙組銀牌決賽，巴士與南華之役，雙方都　動員了全力上陣，巴士紅甲耀目，祇見李天生，麥紹漢，卓石金這三雙國脚，宿將楊根保，和孫寳安，譚家駿，黃瑞琪幾員「凖甲組」健兒都掃數臨塲，莫說乙組隊裏是空前僅見，卽以現下甲組各隊中的實力都有許多比不上的。那邊南華也藍衣鮮明，雖然也是人强馬壯，但細看名單，顯然是較遜一籌了。</p>
<p>大戰結果，巴士以三對一擊敗南華，榮奪乙組銀牌，自是意中的事，但以當時的情勢來看，南華的演出，平均也不下于巴士，要不是門將包景賢的低能，巴士實在不易言勝。而巴士能够保持勝局，却反是門將孫寳安穩健赴色的大功。</p>
<p>這一塲決鬥，名稱雖是「乙」組，但賽來的迅捷精彩，在甲組聯賽中也不多見。祇看黎頌賢幾脚凶險的遠射，看幾雙「國脚」的老路縱橫，就够觀眾讚羨不絕。</p>
<p>上半塲的紀錄，是由卓石金遠吊，鍾景生在南華門將慌忙不知所措的時候頂入的。（一比〇）下半塲不及五分鐘，楊根保看中了南華的無能，又是一脚元吊而入。（二比〇）後來南華朱錦成在邊陲起篆，作美妙傳中，黎頌賢也以牙還牙的遠射建功，打成一比二的局勢，最後巴士譚家駿得球傳前由鍾景生在亂軍中衝進射入一球，而完成了三比一的勝局，兩陣如下：</p>
<p>巴士乙</p>
<p>孫寳安</p>
<p>李天生　麥兆漢</p>
<p>譚家駿　羅保善　黃瑞琪</p>
<p>陳錦瑞　卓石金　鍾景生　楊根保　曾銘泉</p>
<p>南華乙</p>
<p>包景賢</p>
<p>簡直恩　阮佩文</p>
<p>馮樹棠　郭　蘇　朱德文</p>
<p>卓　雲　周　杰　何文傑　黎頌賢　朱錦成</p>
<h3>硬地網球表演　香港勝了西貢</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕採台維斯盃制的港越綱球表演賽，在中華游樂會舉行的硬地賽，已圓滿結束，香港以三比二勝了西貢。</p>
<p>第一日的結果是：</p>
<p>文　綏</p>
<p>六比四　四比六　六比二</p>
<p>徐潤培</p>
<p>葉觀雄</p>
<p>六比三　六比〇</p>
<p>阿　龍</p>
<p>第二日的結果是：</p>
<p>阿　龍</p>
<p>六比二　六比一</p>
<p>徐潤培</p>
<p>葉觀雄</p>
<p>八比六　六比三</p>
<p>文綏</p>
<p>葉觀雄　徐煒培</p>
<p>七比五　六比四</p>
<p>文　綏　阿　龍</p>
<p>至於第二幕的對抗賽，據何家　對記者談，需待都北（全法第六手）抵步後，重新抽籤，始可決定賽程，看上去，香港還是贏面佔多，因爲都北必然較文綏爲好，但法國網球家未必嫻於草地，而在木球會舉行的草地賽，第二單打將由徐煒培出席，他也有勝文綏的可能。</p>

<h3>籃球甲一組賽　老番今夕火併</h3>
<p>籃球聯賽甲一組今日兩番火併，恩卡斯迎海靑，下午六時在南京西路西僑靑年會健身房舉行，裁判　劉荷生，陶勃林基。恩卡斯在聯甲中戰績未見理想，然演出至佳，新人泊透尤爲危險人物，况西靑球房該隊係地頭蛇，熟練非凡，故勝利可操左券，海靑乃却爾敦艦隊，爲美海軍中實力較弱之一旅，今晚遭遇能征慣戰之恩卡斯，必然凶多吉少也。</p>

<h3>三星陣綫強大　勝磐隊半打球　明日下午龍頭對抗中藝</h3>
<p>三星足球隊昨日人馬齊備，以六比一大勝磐隊於民主盃，三星踢來人人賣力，個個出色，今後若仍能以此堅強陣綫出塲，則對於民主盃之染指，尙有極大希望，磐隊雖負六球，但實際球勢並非一面倒，各塲演出楚楚可觀，尤其錢銘與孫勇達極多美妙鏡頭，祗守門宋伯壽昨稍大意耳。上半時比數三對〇，翟錫根先聲奪人，張傑與陸慶祥繼續立功。休息後再戰，費春林造成四對〇，磐隊鋒綫力攻，三星門前險象叢生，卒由哈增光扳回一球，經後陸慶祥大施威力，連中兩球，擴大紀錄爲六比一終局，全賽過程動作清晰，雙方盡歡而散。</p>

<h3>兵乓須知</h3>
<p>— 心景着　陈霖校</p>
<p>（五）球拍的握法和手臂的运用</p>
<p>先研究球　拍的握法。球　拍的握法很多，大别可以分为两种：一种是倒执式，手腕与球　拍曲成镰刀形，和执笔的样子差不多。一种是横执式，手腕与球　拍是成一直线，保持水平式的。</p>
<p>横执式的握法，拍的柄和面全受拇指的支配。有时折食指的关节，拇指用力拗拍，也可以变成倒执式的。但握力一经放鬆，就还成横执式了。</p>
<p>这两种握法，倒执式运用比较便利，横执式拗腕等很不自然，所以采用横执式的人是比较的少数。</p>
<p>这是从大体上说。要是詳細的辦認各人的握法，可以說一個人有一個人的樣子。在這裏不想記載各式各樣的握法，多費篇幅，而要提出極有關係的三點，供大家參考：</p>
<p>一，握拍要顧到運用的靈便　運用的靈便和自己的習慣固然很有關係，但實際上也許自己主觀的並不感到不便，而對於發揮球藝有妨礙的確實不少。我有一次看到某君的握法，他的手定握在擊球的部分，食指伏在球拍的邊上，把大指和其餘三指在兩面用力揑住，這種握法，由我們客觀的去批評，當然在運用上比較的欠靈便。</p>
<p>二，握拍要顧到充分的發揮全力　擊球本來用不到每拍都要用全力。但我們握球拍無論如何要能够用全力。有些人只用大指和食指的一部分着拍，充其量能够用得出幾多的力量？這是應該注意的。</p>
<p>三，指力的調劑　拍球時，球拍並不要自始至終用力的緊揑，在一拍和一停之間，用力和不用力也應相間，只要在洞悉來勢，描凖方向，把球擊出的一瞬間緊緊握持，否則手指不免太容易疲乏了。</p>
<p>手臂的運用，最關緊要的是運用全臂。運用全臂有兩點顯而易見的好處：</p>
<p>一，有力　把全臂運用，那麼活動的範圍較大，預備姿勢比較充分，拍球時用力自然也大了。</p>
<p>二，節省體力　運用了全臂，能够顧到的範圍已經很大，全身活動比較自然，對於站立的地位而言，也較能固定，可以避免不少無謂的奔跑，這些都是不至顧分費力，顯而易見的事實。體力節省，方能從事於長久的練習。幷且爲了運用的自然，進步也一定來快了。有些活動的部分只限於手　，那是應該立卽設法更改的。</p>

<h3>今年的「王四酒家」</h3>
<p>— 錢太成</p>
<p>常熟興福寺山門口的王四酒家」，確可以說得上一聲名聞江南了。易君左題過詩，豐子愷作過畫。「黃鷄白酒，山看野　。」本地的老　，遠來的旅客，大家都說：「價錢雖然貴一點，但實是够味。」——於是它門前的一片廣塲上，在春秋佳日，汽車，包車，人力車，自行車總是排得擁擠萬分。跟它衡宇相對的「虞山酒家」，雖同樣也有桂花白酒，油鷄松簟，生意卻並不好。有時「王四酒家」實在太擠了，「虞山酒家」纔得分到它一點餘潤。於是有人說：常熟最能賺錢尤其最能賺外面人的錢的是「王四酒家」，「山景間」和「馬泳齌」還瞠乎其後呢。</p>
<p>今年的「王四酒家」呢酒旗依然挑起，靑靑的虞山，照樣映帶左右。它的門前却沒有一輛汽車，人力車也只有三數輛，猜拳行令的聲音聽不到，更看不到有誰扶得醉人歸。樓下有幾個村農在喝口白酒，樓頭酒客稀少。有人說：「王四酒家風水變了！今年要蝕本了！」有人說：最近治安堪虞，所以上海人也不敢來了」。其實也未必，在淪陷時期，日本人作威作福，一刻兒戒嚴，一刻要檢查「良民證」，「王四酒家」照樣座上客常滿，後來日本人在附近趕築防禦工程的時候，大家還照樣是大喫大喝。江南人對於治安根本不放在心上，最傷他們腦筋的還是錢。最近幾年來，大家的錢，從法幣變為「偽幣」，從「偽幣又變為法幣，法幣更變為「金圓券」，金圓劵又在變了。橫一變，盬一變，變多的人固也有，不過大多數人是變光了。黃鷄白酒自然喫不成了，王四酒家靠着小資產階級而興，當然也隨着小資產階級而沒落了。王四酒家在民國初年是村農們的酒店，在那時，我們可以看到在夕陽西斜的當兒，村農們箕踞跣足，酒酣耳熱，而歌烏烏。嗣後，王四酒家從村農的酒店而變為小資產階級的酒店，最後，更變而為官僚大腹賈的酒店。未來的王四酒家恐怕要反本歸原吧？反本歸原也就是歸眞返樸。到了那時，我們可以看到田家作苦，新穀登塲之後，家家扶得醉人歸了。倘使王四酒家還一味想做上海人的生意，那它是一定要沒落了。</p>
<h3>老頭與新頭</h3>

<p>目前「大　　　　　　之聲，正閙成一片，不論口頭，街頭，市上，報上，無不有此四字。不知是誰首先喊出以頭之大小來區別銀洋，不過我們知道，以頭的不同來區別銀洋，從前也有過的，不過是「新頭『與「老頭」之分罷了</p>
<p>遠在淸季廣州與外洋通商之初，最先流入的外國貨幣，是有克拉魯斯三世（一七五九年卽位）頭像的西班牙銀元；至於墨西哥鷹洋等等，實遠在其後。這種銀元，因較當時流通的銀塊。元寳為方便，旣易藏，又可靠，故大受一般人的歡迎。</p>
<p>克拉魯斯五一世死後，此種銀洋不再鼓鑄，其後流入的，是克拉魯斯四世銀洋。然因舊時銀洋使用已久，習慣及印象上均較深，其價値自亦與新到者不同，所以，克拉魯斯三世的銀洋較四世的為貴。</p>
<p>因為國人不識古怪的西班牙文，於是就稱前者為「老頭」，後者為「新頭」。</p>

<p>這音調，極自然悅耳而鏗鏘動聽，誰都樂於欣賞，喜於傾聽。有人覺得其聲錚錚，如奏笛簫管笛；有人覺得其聲如泣如訴，像一支傷感的哀曲；，一板一眼，正扣動了每人的心弦深處。總之：這聲音太感動了，足令人會心一笑，又足令人勢淚盈眶。</p>
<p>用古語說，這該是「天籟」；用新名詞說，這該是道地的」人民音樂」，最易激起人們的由衷共鳴。它，說不上藝術，也並非什麼精心傑作的「幻想曲」，但却往往引起了各人各異的「幻想」。這幻想，有時是美麗的，敎痛苦憂鬰的人得到安慰，敎萬念俱灰的破涕為笑。他們幻想着「明天，後天，漲漲……」</p>

<h3>Third-Party Representatives Arrive in Beijing from Peiping to Fully Promote the Success of Peace Talks, Formal Negotiations Postponed to Begin on the 8th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] During the peace talks in Peiping, representatives of third-party individuals have arrived in Nanjing from Peiping to convey their opinions to Acting President Li and are determined to do their utmost to promote the success of the peace talks. These two representatives of third-party individuals, accompanied by one staff member, flew from Peiping by special plane to Nanjing on the evening of the 5th. They were accompanied by Liu Zhongrong (not Liu Zhonghua. Liu Zhonghua is an advisor to the government delegation, while Liu Zhongrong was formerly the secretary of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association and had long been in Peiping; this time he was ordered to return to Nanjing) from the government side. However, due to various reasons, reporters are unable to disclose their names. After disembarking, the representatives immediately met with Acting President Li, personally delivering replies from Li Jishen, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Lan, and others to Acting President Li, and explaining the third-party's opinions in support of the success of the peace talks. Acting President Li immediately telegraphed Premier He Yingqin to come to the official residence to participate in the discussions. In the afternoon of the 6th, the two representatives went out to visit relevant individuals and deliver letters from Li, Zhang, Zhang, etc. It is reported that these representatives of third-party individuals will stay in Nanjing for several days, and the date of their return to Peiping is undetermined.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] According to traditionally reliable sources: after the peace talks in Peiping began on the morning of the 5th, because neither side had put forward a plan during the representatives' meeting, there were considerable technical problems in the negotiations. After consultation, the two sides agreed to jointly formulate steps for the peace talks to proceed, and rescheduled the formal commencement to the 8th. On the 5th and 6th, the representatives of both sides maintained close contact and studied negotiation steps that both sides could agree on, so that formal negotiations could begin on the 8th. The atmosphere was extremely harmonious when the representatives of both sides met.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] The government is closely monitoring reports about the progress of the peace talks in Peiping. Since the government's peace delegation flew to Peiping, little news has come from Peiping. However, this issue is clearly of greatest concern to the people of the whole country. Presidential Palace spokesman, Second Bureau Director Huang Xuecun, and Executive Yuan spokesman Bao Jing'an discussed this matter on the 6th. In order to avoid affecting the peace talks, it was immediately decided to telegraph the government representatives in Peiping to agree with the CCP on what could be published regarding the daily progress of negotiations, and then telegraph it to Nanjing for publication.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 6th] Huang Qihan, who had just returned to Beijing from Peiping, flew to Hankou yesterday afternoon and immediately visited Bai Chongxi to report. Huang was visited by reporters from various local newspapers after leaving headquarters on the morning of the 6th, but they have not been able to meet him as of tonight.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] Regarding the rumored "final ultimatum" from the CCP demanding the government surrender, after reporters inquired in all directions, no official denial or confirmation could be obtained. It is generally believed that this rumor may have arisen from the arrival of third-party representatives in Nanjing or the New China News Agency's editorial broadcast on the evening of the 6th demanding the government surrender to the people. Official circles in Nanjing are quiet as usual, still confident in the peace talks, and there are no signs of unease after receiving the "final ultimatum."</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] Authoritative sources claimed today: the CCP has issued a final ultimatum demanding the government's actual surrender. The CCP proposes that a joint committee be established before Saturday of this week to supervise the transfer of Kuomintang troops to the CCP's command within three days. After this final ultimatum was issued, it was heard that Acting President Li had notified diplomatic representatives of Western countries, saying that the CCP army may cross the river within ten days.</p>
<h3>Peace Talk Representative Li Zheng Will Return to Nanjing to Investigate the Truth of the April 1st Incident; The Executive Yuan Denies that the Case Will Impact the Peace Talks; Luo Chunbo and Others Go to Various Schools to Investigate the Facts</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] It is heard that government peace talk representative Li Zheng will soon return to Nanjing from Peiping. His mission is to investigate the truth of the April 1st incident. He will not stay in Nanjing for long and will still go to Peiping.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] Executive Yuan spokesman Bao Jing'an solemnly denied to reporters on the 6th that the peace talks had encountered complications due to the Nanjing April 1st incident. Bao said: the peace talks are progressing smoothly. Some newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai reported on the 6th that the peace talks had encountered complications because of the April 1st incident, making it impossible to start the peace talks. However, according to reporters, after the peace talks officially began on the 5th, the reason for the postponement was that both sides' preparations were not sufficient. This postponement has nothing to do with the April 1st incident. Officials absolutely deny to reporters the impact of the April 1st incident on the peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] Luo Chunbo, director of the Political Warfare Department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, and Shen Shaolun, member of the Ministry of Education's Educational Research Council, were assigned to investigate the truth of the April 1st incident. On the afternoon of the 6th, they went to Jinling University, Central University, National Chengchi University, the Drama College, and the Officers' Reception General Team. On the one hand, they investigated the actual situation of the April 1st incident; on the other hand, they consoled the teachers, students, and officers of each school. According to Director Luo after returning from the investigation: more than 8,000 officers have been discharged from the Officers' Reception Team, and 80 percent of them have already been dismissed or assigned to leave the team.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] The "Aftermath Handling Committee of the April 1st Bloodshed Incident" organized by college students in Nanjing, published a "Letter to the National Compatriots Again" on the 6th, demanding that the masterminds of the bloodshed incident be removed from their posts and investigated, that the bodies of dead students and school employees and missing workers be returned, that all losses be compensated, and that people's freedom and safety be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Xiamen University Students on Strike for Three Days</h3>
<p>[Our Xiamen Dispatch of the 6th] After the April 1st incident, Xiamen University students decided to go on strike for three days starting from the 7th, sending telegrams to the government to severely punish the perpetrators, and sending telegrams to console the injured classmates.</p>
<h3>The CCP Wants the Government to Surrender to the "People"</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Last night, after "Where is the Nanjing Government Going?", the CCP radio broadcast another New China News Agency editorial, "Demanding the Nanjing Government Surrender to the People." The article stated that the Kuomintang government should be held responsible for the war disaster suffered by the Chinese people in recent years, and all important responsible party, government, and military personnel should also bear responsibility according to the severity of the circumstances. If the government's civil and military officials can "recognize right and wrong, repent sincerely, act out of true sincerity, and have concrete actions that are conducive to the advancement of the people's liberation cause and the peaceful resolution of domestic problems, regardless of who they are, they are welcome." Otherwise, the people will absolutely not forgive their crimes, and they will not escape the people's trial and punishment. The commentary pointed out that Fu Zuoyi, with an "honest attitude," has begun to take "meritorious service to redeem his sins." Although there are also those in the government who hope to participate in the peaceful resolution of domestic problems, they are still continuing to associate with the pro-war Jiang and oppose the advancement of the CCP army, oppose accepting the CCP's eight conditions, oppose surrender, and advocate equal and glorious peace. The adoption of this attitude is actually due to the refusal to hand over war criminals to the people for punishment, the refusal to reorganize the army, the refusal to be taken over by the government, and even the demand to restore the status of the old Political Consultative Conference era, demanding an unconditional ceasefire on the spot, and demanding that the CCP army not enter south of the Yangtze River to liberate 200 million oppressed compatriots. Its purpose is to seek to preserve its power as capital for a comeback.</p>
<h3>A Rift Has Developed Between Democrats and Liberals and the CCP; CCP Figures Live in Luxury in the Best Hotels; Li Jishen Is Dwarfed and Only Gets a Small Room</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong Dispatch of the 6th] Chinese separatists went from Hong Kong to Peiping to participate in peace talks, but the result may be that they will not participate. According to the "China Mail": leaders of democratic and liberal factions wrote from Peiping saying: a rift has developed between these factions and the CCP, so they may not be invited to participate in the peace talks. The CCP has taken over the best residences and hotels, while second-class hotels are provided to the leaders of the Democratic League and the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee. Li Jishen, the leader of the Revolutionary Committee, only got one room in the Peiping International Hotel.</p>
<p>The commentary pointed out that "between reactionary war criminals who sell out the country and the revolutionary people, there is absolutely no allowance for equality," and also said that since Japan's surrender, the Kuomintang government, with the support of the United States, has repeatedly rejected peace, so this debt of blood, even if "ten thousand deaths are not enough to atone for their crimes." Now, the CCP allows meritorious service to redeem sins under eight conditions, which is a generous policy of "what great imperial grace." The conclusion of the article is that war criminals cannot demand glory, and should surrender politically to the people, and hand over their weapons.</p>
<h3>Government Expenditures This Month Will Reach 800 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] It is reported that the government's expenditures for April will reach 800 billion yuan, including 100 billion yuan for subsidies for transportation enterprises and 180 billion yuan for the cost of airlifting grain to Taiyuan.</p>
<h3>The Range of Gold Price Fluctuations is Decided to be Widened to 20%; Bank Drafts Should be Exchanged on the Same Day</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] In order to strengthen the control of finance, the Ministry of Finance recently issued three instructions to the Gold Control Bureau: (1) The amount of bank drafts issued by banks should not exceed their deposit in the national bank the next day; (2) Certified checks from various banks should not be circulated as bank drafts; (3) Bank drafts from various banks should be sent to the check clearing house for transfer on the same day. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has decided to widen the range of gold price fluctuations to 20%.</p>
<h3>Tao Zhiyue Tours Turpan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Telecommunication of the 6th] Xinjiang Garrison Commander Tao Zhiyue and Political Work Office Director Liang Kexun departed to tour Turpan, Maqi, and other places.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Three Committees of the Legislative Yuan; Xu Yongchang and Gu Zhutong Report on Military Reorganization Plan; The Number of National Troops Cannot Be Reduced Further from 4.2 Million; Liu Gongyun Says That It Is Impossible to Afford to Pay Salaries in Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] The Legislative Yuan's National Defense Budget and Finance and Banking Three-Committee held a joint meeting on the morning of the 6th to discuss the proposal submitted by committee member Wang Guangqing and others "requesting the government to quickly determine a military reorganization plan, reduce the number of troops, tighten expenditures, verify salary payments, and reduce non-combat personnel to save national funds." More than 160 committee members attended, and Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang, Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun, Vice Minister of National Defense Xiao Yisu, and others were invited to attend. Committee member Wang Zemin presided. First, Xu Yongchang and Gu Zhutong were asked to report on the military reorganization plan. In addition to explaining the main points of the military reorganization, Xu and Gu both stated that the minimum number of national troops was 4.2 million and could not be reduced further, but in order to improve the treatment of soldiers and boost morale, soldiers' treatment was still hoped to be paid in silver dollars according to the previously planned plan. The Ministry of National Defense has now determined that each soldier will be paid two silver dollars, and the remainder will be paid in gold yuan according to the market price of silver dollars. Then, Liu Gongyun reported on the financial situation. Liu said that if the military's treatment was all paid in silver dollars, 90 million silver dollars would be needed each month. If civil servants also requested to be paid in silver dollars as an example, another 30 million silver dollars would be needed, totaling 120 million silver dollars. The Ministry of Finance really cannot afford this, and it is also beyond the mint's manufacturing capacity. The current mint's capacity is only to produce 10 million silver dollars per month, so the matter of paying soldiers in silver dollars may not be fully realized. Because the minimum amount of silver dollars to be paid to soldiers is 60 million, this is quite difficult for the Ministry of Finance to handle. After Xu, Gu, Liu, and others finished their reports, the legislators asked questions. Wang Hongshao spoke, believing that military reorganization should take into account financial resources, and should improve the treatment of officers and soldiers and adopt a policy of elite troops. Ge Jingen believed that the Legislative Yuan did not need to discuss the number of troops, but should approve the budget. Bai Jianmin believed that military reorganization should be reasonable, rational, and legal. Zou Shuwen asked whether the reduction of troops contradicted the conscription. Jia Chengzhang advocated paying salaries by name and reducing non-combat personnel as much as possible, and also advocated that the Ministry of National Defense should join the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans to organize an inspection tour. Yu Zheng said that military reorganization is not troop reduction, and should seek refinement and practicality. Lei Yin said that there were too many service soldiers in the troops. Yu Ruzhou believed that military discipline should be rectified. Jiang Yiping hoped that the military authorities would work with the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans and other public opinion institutions to do verification work. There were also Bao Huaguo and many others who spoke, and the various leaders answered the various questions raised. The final resolution was "please ask the Ministry of National Defense to adopt the opinions of the committee members as much as possible, and to organize the military reorganization plan, together with the Ministry of National Defense's organizational law and the army, navy, and air force establishment, and send it to the Legislative Yuan for discussion in the shortest possible time."</p>
<h3>Sun Yueqi Reports on the Economy at the Legislative Yuan's Economic Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] The Legislative Yuan's Economic and Resources Committee held a full committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 6th. More than 60 committee members attended, including Zou Shuwen, Wang Lihang, Wu Wangji, etc. Li Yunliang presided. Minister of Economic Affairs Sun Yueqi, Vice Ministers Jian Guansan and Zhang Liling, and Vice Chairman of the Resources Committee Wu Zhaohong were all in attendance. At the meeting, Minister Sun was heard to report on the policy direction. Sun explained in detail on three points: (1) the basic spirit of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' policy direction; (2) increasing the necessary domestic agricultural and industrial production; (3) reducing unnecessary restrictions on agriculture, industry, and commerce. Finally, he pointed out that the past policy of controlling economic policy with financial policy will be corrected in the future. After Sun finished his report, more than ten legislators, including Ge Jingen, Dong Yinzhang, Wang Lihang, and Wu Wangji, spoke, making suggestions and raising questions about economic policy. Dong and others mostly advocated abolishing the Transportation Control Committee to facilitate the normal development of industry and commerce. Sun is scheduled to attend the Economic and Resources Committee again on the afternoon of the 7th to give a reply.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan's Budget Committee Discusses the Case of Improving the Treatment of Public and Educational Personnel</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] The Legislative Yuan's Budget Committee met on the morning of the 6th to discuss again the "Case of the Reasonable Adjustment of the Treatment of Public and Educational Personnel Nationwide Should Be Expedited" proposed by Committee Member Yang Yifeng and others. Ten committee members attended, including Mao Yihu and others, with Yuan Qijiong presiding. Committee members Jin Shaoxian and Yuan Qijiong both proposed amendments for discussion. The committee members all believed that this case was of great importance, and the committee members' opinions were inconsistent. It should be decided after the Ministry of Finance submits a report on the limits of the adjustment plan, and then study it together. The review meeting will be reopened this Saturday.</p>

However, the heads of various departments of the Executive Yuan are all in Nanjing, and the Executive Yuan's political affairs meetings are also held in Beijing, so I will only delay for a few days here and must return to Beijing. Guangzhou is the source of the revolution. It has been more than four years since Yingqin came here for the surrender in 1945. Coming here again this time is full of mixed feelings."</p>

<h3>The Situation in Yizheng is Tense Again; The CCP Army on the West Side of the Jinpu Railway Attacks Jiangpu</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 6th] Reliable news: after the situation in Yizheng stabilized on the 5th, it suddenly became tense again on the 6th. At dawn, the CCP's Eighth Column (now reorganized into the 26th Army), led by Zhang Mingchu with more than 3,000 troops, opened to the Xupuqiao Town, an important bridgehead north of the city, via Chuzhou and Liuhe. Its advance troops have approached the Lamyiao stronghold, which was recovered by the garrison on the 5th. The CCP army is now distributed two or three li outside the city to build trenches. A major contact will occur in the area within one or two days. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren has urgently telegraphed the province and the Second Fleet of the Navy stationed in Zhenjiang, asking them to send elite troops and fleets overnight to increase defense in order to ensure this isolated city in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 6th] About one battalion of artillery from an unidentified CCP army, with more than 20 artillery pieces, arrived at Qijiaxiang, 20 li north of Sanjiangying in Zhenjiang on the 4th, with unknown intentions.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] On the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, between Puzhen and Flag Camp, the situation was still calm on the 6th. However, more than 1,000 CCP troops in Quanxiao, on the west side of the railway, suddenly attacked Jiangpu City on the night of the 5th. In order to concentrate their forces, the National Army automatically abandoned outposts such as Ma'anshan, Wolongshan, and Xiaoma Mountain. The war has moved to the vicinity of the city's suburbs. By the morning of the 6th, after the air force was dispatched to assist in the battle, the CCP army was finally forced to retreat.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] It is reported that the main force of Chen Yi's Fourth Columns, including the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th Columns, has indeed begun to withdraw from the Jing, Tai, Yang, and Tong areas north of the Yangtze River and move to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, but its intentions cannot yet be determined.</p>
<h3>The Anqing Battle Turns Quiet; Communist Army's Renewed Offensive Again Smashed; Huayuan on the Pinghan Line Automatically Abandoned</h3>
<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 6th] The Anqing battle has become quieter since the morning of the 6th. The offensive launched by the Communist army since the night of the 4th, after two nights and a day of fierce fighting, was completely crushed by the Nationalist army before dawn on the 6th. The Communist army suffered more than 4,000 casualties. Today, the battle has gradually turned quiet. According to military judgment, unless the Communist army makes further reinforcements, it will have no power to commit further offenses. The Nationalist army is still firmly defending its original position.</p>
<p>[Our Jiujiang Dispatch, 6th] The Anqing front was quiet all day on the 6th. According to observations by relevant parties, the Communist army may be making other deployments. The Nationalist army advanced its troops in the eastern suburbs of the city by another 1,000 meters yesterday afternoon. Its outposts are about ten li from the urban area. There were no changes on the northern, southern, and western fronts. According to military statistics, since the Communist army began attacking Anqing on the 23rd of last month, casualties up to the 5th of this month are close to 20,000. The ratio of Communist to Nationalist army casualties is two to one, and the ratio of troop strength is five to one. According to intelligence estimates, the invading Communist army may maintain a force of 50,000, while the Nationalist army only reaches one-fifth of that number. This proves that the troops participating in this battle are highly morale, and the cooperation between the army, navy, and air force has achieved great results. As for the Communist army's claim to cross the Yangtze River at Wuxue Tianjia Town, the military here judges that the Communist army probably has no such intention at present.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Military News Agency: After the Anqing garrison repelled the Communist army's fierce offensive on the night of the 4th with army-navy coordination, it recovered the Wulimiao area five miles east of Anqing and the Taihu Dam in one fell swoop, killing and wounding more than 1,000 Communist soldiers and capturing more than 100 Communist soldiers. The Nationalist army also suffered more than 100 casualties. In addition, a unit of the Communist army, traveling on six wooden boats, launched a sneak attack on the garrison at Heihe Island (near Digang north of Fanchang) at 2:00 AM on the 6th. After half an hour of fighting, the Communist army was defeated and retreated.</p>
<p>[Our Xiaogan Dispatch, 6th] In order to consolidate the security of the periphery of Wuhan and strengthen the river defense, the Nationalist army in the southern section of Pinghan has continued to actively retreat southward in recent days and has now withdrawn to the vicinity of Xiaojia Village north of Xiaogan to block the Communist army continuing to invade southward.</p>
<p>[Our Xiaogan Dispatch, 6th] Military News: Because the flanks and front of the Xiaogan position have become stable, the Nationalist army continued to abandon Huayuan on the 5th. According to news from the morning of the 6th, two regiments of the Communist 10th Column entered the area five li east of Huayuan Town on the 5th. The railroad bridges and beams at the north and south ends of Huayuan were slightly damaged, and the station became a vacuum zone.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Today, there was no major contact between the Nationalist and Communist armies along the Pinghan Line and on both sides. The Communist army descending south from Luoshan in the east of the line is still advancing rapidly towards the line from Hekou east of Huayuan to Zhangcheling. The Communist army and most of the 10th Column in the west of the line have retreated to Anlu. More than 3,000 casualties from the Communist army on the west bank of the Huan River west of Huayuan have been concentrated in Anle City for treatment after three days and nights of stretcher transport.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The United Nations General Assembly and the Atlantic Pact</h3>
<p>Just as the East and West are engaged in a fierce Cold War over the signing of the Atlantic Pact, the United Nations General Assembly has opened on the shores of Lake Success, attempting to resolve the world's current major problems in a peaceful manner. To people of all countries who yearn for world peace, it is a gratifying event, and they place earnest hopes on this General Assembly. Even the representatives of various countries attending the General Assembly could not help but applaud warmly at the scene of US Representative Acheson and Soviet Representative Gromyko shaking hands and making peace, which is enough to prove that the desire for world peace is a common psychology of people around the world. The future of world peace seems bright and straightforward. However, in order to sign the Atlantic Pact, the Soviet Union had already launched its propaganda war, doing its utmost to attack the United Kingdom and the United States for attempting to launch a new international war, and had separately notified the seven Western countries, denouncing them as violating international agreements and showing aggressiveness. Even its vassal states were willing to be the tail of the Soviet Union, standing beside the Soviet Union, waving flags and shouting, and also strongly criticized the Atlantic Pact for having the smell of gunpowder. Now that the United Nations General Assembly is meeting on the shores of Lake Success, the Soviet representative will not let go of this good opportunity and remain silent. Therefore, we predict that this United Nations General Assembly will publicly discuss whether the Atlantic Pact violates the United Nations Charter. At that time, the Cold War between the East and West will inevitably become more intense, and whether the United Nations can safely overcome this serious test has become a major question.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the Atlantic Pact has become a matter of international right and wrong today. Summarizing the opinions of various Soviet newspapers, magazines, and telegrams, the signing of the Atlantic Pact is sufficient to lead to a new international war. The reasons are three: (1) The Atlantic Pact has an open aggressive nature and is aimed at the Soviet Union; (2) It violates the United Nations Charter; (3) It undermines the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet Treaties of Friendship, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Agreement. On the British and American side, they strongly stated that the Atlantic Pact is a regional security system aimed at defending against aggression. When President Truman gave a speech at the signing ceremony of the Atlantic Pact, he stated that "Today's ceremony is historic, and its purpose is to enable this international treaty to fulfill its task of protecting the security and prosperity of the signatory countries. What we have signed is a "good neighbor agreement." The signatory countries are willing to abide by the peaceful principles of the United Nations organization, live in friendship with all countries, and implement economic mutual assistance. In the future, if the territory or independence of any signatory country is threatened, they will discuss ways to deal with it and provide assistance to the victim of aggression."</p>
<p>Standing from a third-party position, we can say that we see this international right and wrong more clearly than anyone else. But from the perspective of cause and effect, it is quite a "chicken lays an egg, an egg hatches a chicken" mystery. Why do we say this? The signing of the Atlantic Pact is sufficient to create international fortifications, deepen the division of the two worlds in the East and West, and lead mankind to the path of war, and it is indeed possible to create these consequences. The accusations made by the Soviet side also have their reasons in theory. But we want to ask why the United Kingdom and the United States want to conclude the Atlantic Pact? After the end of World War II, who did not yearn for the ideal of one world, who did not hope for the successful creation of world peace? In particular, the diplomatic policies of the United Kingdom and the United States made every effort to move towards this goal, and tried every means to promote international understanding and cooperation in order to seek the joint efforts of the wartime allies to create peace. The repeated convening of foreign ministers' meetings and the regular holding of the United Nations General Assembly were aimed at promoting world unity and resolving international issues through peaceful means. However, for three or four years, things went against expectations. The international undertow surged. Because of differences in ideology and conflicts of interest, not only was the ideal of one world not realized, but the Cold War intensified, making the postwar world even more distant from true peace. President Truman and Prime Minister Atlee, although they made great efforts to seek understanding with the Soviet Union, the Cold War spread from Europe to Asia, almost covering the entire globe, putting the world, which had suffered from war, to a moment of shock again. The United Kingdom and the United States have sufficient reasons to conclude the Atlantic Pact, which is defensive in nature, in order to ensure the peace and security of the North Atlantic, which no one can oppose. The Soviet Union's protest is inevitably too subjective and easily reminds people of Nazi Germany on the eve of World War II, which repeatedly accused the United Kingdom and France of adopting an encirclement policy against Germany, and now history is repeating itself.</p>
<p>However, in order to ensure our own security and peace, we should take a "non-intervention" attitude towards this international right and wrong, so as not to be swept into the vortex of international right and wrong. Indian Prime Minister Nehru's statement on the Atlantic Pact stated that India is not in the North Atlantic region, so it is not interested in this pact; at the same time, he solemnly stated India's determination to stay out of international political groups. This attitude can be described as the most sensible. We hope that China also has a clear understanding.</p>
<p>After the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, it will proceed according to the agenda and publicly discuss this issue. The Soviet Union can once again use this matter to scold the United States as a "warmonger," which may cause a great uproar on Lake Success. Standing on the principle of international peace first, we hope that the representatives of both East and West can sit down calmly, and with a spirit of mutual trust, mutual tolerance, and mutual concession, explore a broad road for world peace. Do not act impulsively and break faces for the sake of the Atlantic Pact, causing the newly born United Nations to suffer the fate of the old League of Nations.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Garrison Command Surrounds NTU Dormitories and Teachers College; Orders Surrender of Twenty Students Conspiring to Disrupt; Fu Sinian Demands Bail for Arrested Students Be Handled by the Court</h3>

Reporters interviewed relevant authorities and NTU President Fu Sinian separately, but they were silent on the matter. According to an official announcement, it was reported that twenty students from NTU and Teachers College were the masterminds behind posting slogans, distributing leaflets, inciting the people, endangering public security, and even smashing public offices and detaining public officials, with ulterior motives. On the evening of the 5th, they gathered to discuss plans to expand the disturbance.

NTU President Fu Sinian led three student representatives to the Garrison Command in the morning to meet with Deputy Commander Peng. The Garrison Command hoped that Fu would voluntarily hand over the NTU students listed on the list, and then martial law could be lifted. Fu stated that he had no authority to do so and requested the Garrison Command for (1) bail for the arrested students by the school, and (2) that the case be transferred to the court for handling. However, when the reporter interviewed Fu, he asked whether the students had been arrested, and Fu replied that he did not know. NTU and Teachers College were suspended. Chen Cheng convened a meeting at the Garrison Command at 4:00 PM, gathering the heads of public security in the city and the presidents of NTU and Teachers College to discuss the matter. It was also learned that more than a hundred students from Teachers College voluntarily accompanied their detained classmates on several large trucks from the Garrison Command, leaving the school on the morning of the 6th. It was also learned that Shi Xi, the editor of the supplement of the Xinsheng Daily, and Dong Peihuang, a reporter for the Chenggong Daily, were also arrested on the morning of the 6th.</p>

<h3>Davis, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration in North China, Said That Grain Prices in the Suburbs of Beiping Are Higher Than in the City; Rural Rents and Taxes Are Extremely Heavy</h3>
<p>[Our News] Davis, Director of the North China Office of the Economic Cooperation Administration, held a reception for reporters yesterday after returning to Shanghai and expressed his views on Beiping under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. He said: The supply of food in Beiping is very sufficient. Although rice prices have risen by 70-80% in two months, they are lower when priced in US dollars. However, just twenty miles outside the suburbs, grain prices are about twice as high as in the city. This may be due to the fact that the Chinese Communist Party's trading companies are exchanging kerosene for food in rural areas to supply cities, hence this peculiar phenomenon. Rural rents and taxes are extremely heavy, with an average tax rate of about 60%, so farmers are gradually complaining. The Chinese Communist Party authorities are extremely worried about the possibility of Kuomintang underground activities. The newspapers publish daily warnings to former Kuomintang secret agents, urging them to lay down their weapons and surrender as soon as possible. Davis also said that after the Chinese Communist Party took over Beiping, he met and chatted with a National Army officer and learned that these National Army troops were stationed outside the city, the organization had not changed, all equipment was maintained, and liaison officers were set up above the squad level. The officers all said that they were cooperating rather than surrendering. According to Davis's personal observations, in fact, the actions of the National Army did not consider themselves as defeated troops.</p>
<p>Regarding the general situation in Beiping, Davis said that the Chinese Communist Party personnel have good discipline and are diligent in learning, but they are suffering from a lack of experience and sometimes cannot help but be foolish. Students in Beiping eat millet every day, and the allocation is also low, but they are enthusiastically supporting the new regime and also express that they are quite happy. The reason is that the Chinese Communist Party is good at pleasing students in the newspapers and making these young people feel their own importance. The Chinese Communist Party has a branch of the Southward Work Corps in Ping, with 800 students. Since March, the original plan was to complete the training in four months, but now it has been reduced to two months. The attitude of the students cannot represent the general mood of the residents of Beiping. Signs of opposition have begun to be discovered. Street slogans supporting the Communist Party are often defaced at night.

<h3>UN General Assembly President Urges Cooperation Among Major Powers to Seek World Peace; General Committee Discusses the Case of Ill-Treatment of Clergy in Hungary and Bulgaria; A Heated Debate Erupts; Acheson and Bevin Returned to Washington Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Agency] Lake Success, New York, Radio Broadcast, 6th: The General Committee of the UN General Assembly, consisting of fourteen nations, met on the 6th to discuss the case of Hungary and Bulgaria's ill-treatment of Cardinal Mindszenty and other church leaders. Representatives from Australia and Bolivia proposed that the General Assembly investigate the truth of the case. The Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, immediately launched a fierce attack, accusing the United Nations of having no right to interfere in Hungary and Bulgaria's internal affairs. He said that if the case were placed on the agenda, it would conflict with the UN Charter. Katz-Suchy said that if Hungary and Bulgaria had violated treaty provisions, this matter should first be considered by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. U.S. Representative Austin suggested that the General Committee examine the actions of Hungary and Bulgaria from the perspective of religious freedom and human rights. Katz-Suchy expressed opposition, saying that although the General Assembly opposed the Netherlands, the committee would be able to overcome the difficulties and decide to submit the case to the General Assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 5th] The second session of the Third UN General Assembly opened yesterday at Flushing Meadow. The President of the Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, said in his opening speech that cooperation among the five major powers was essential. The current difficulties in the world were not caused by the UN organization, but by the discord among the major powers. He endorsed President Truman's call for resolute support of the UN organization. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, in his address, assured that the United States and other signatories to the Atlantic Treaty would fully support the UN organization. Acheson first issued a statement to the press, strongly asserting that the American people firmly believed that the United Nations was the greatest hope for establishing a peaceful world society. When Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko entered the UN General Assembly Hall, he was cleared by police and UN security guards. Gromyko smiled and spoke in Russian to Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin, who followed him. Gromyko shook hands and exchanged greetings with Acheson before the meeting. Gromyko did not speak at the opening of the General Assembly, but it was expected that he would formally attack the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>

<h3>U.S., Britain, and France Continue to Discuss the Establishment of a West German Government; U.S. Military Commander in Germany to Be Succeeded by Clark</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 6th] The foreign ministers of the Western three powers met here on the 6th to lay the foundation for the establishment of West Germany. According to diplomatic sources, Secretary of State Acheson, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman will continue to meet at the State Department on the 7th and 8th, possibly longer. Informed sources say that the agenda includes the following two key points: (1) The economic and administrative merger of the French-occupied zone and the British and American-occupied zones in Germany within the next three months; (2) An agreement on the conditions of peace, specifying the powers to be granted to West Germany and the powers to be retained by the occupying countries, which will remain stationed in Germany indefinitely.</p>
<p>Since the three foreign ministers held discussions on March 31st, preparations for this meeting have been actively underway. Experts on German issues at the State Department have been working on documents and plans day and night. Experts from London and Paris have also been summoned for consultations. British officials said, "Regardless of Soviet opposition, the three powers are now determined to proceed with the establishment of West Germany." One of the issues to be discussed at this meeting is to determine how much power the United States should have in terms of West Germany's economic issues. Britain agrees that since the United States bears the majority of the occupation costs and reconstruction costs, it should have a decisive say on certain issues. However, they need to precisely define "economic issues" in order to retain their own powers in matters of particular concern to Britain. For example, Britain opposes further expansion of the German merchant fleet, while some American officials support this, believing it is necessary to make Germany self-sufficient. Furthermore, France is now trying to hold a greater degree of military control over the occupied zone than Britain and the United States consider appropriate.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Reliable sources confirm that Lieutenant General Clark, commander of the Sixth Army, will be transferred to serve as the U.S. military commander in Germany to succeed Clay.

Italy recently requested to establish several consulates in the Soviet Union, but was rejected by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Communist Rebels Launch New Offensive with Reinforcements from Albania; New "Free Greece" Government Established</h3>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 5th] The Greek Communist Party has announced the formation of a new government, with representatives of the "Free Macedonian Movement" joining the cabinet for the first time.

<h3>United States Celebrates Army Day; 1.6 Million Troops Stationed Abroad Hold Ceremonies; Johnson Praises the Achievements of the U.S. Army</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 5th] President Truman formally announced that ceremonies will be held on April 6th in all places where U.S. troops are stationed around the world to celebrate Army Day, allowing Americans to express their respect for the U.S. Army's contribution to the country's peace, welfare, and security. Army officials said that 1.6 million troops in the U.S. Army will participate in the celebrations abroad.</p>
<p>In the United States, Army units, naval and air forces, religious, and civic groups will hold group celebrations. Stores, factories, and other industrial organizations will also celebrate U.S. Army Day. These industrial and commercial organizations closely cooperated with the U.S. Army during World War II. Secretary of Defense Johnson said in a special Army Day message that the U.S. Army "has made great contributions to the welfare of the United States in peacetime and has never disgraced its mission in wartime." Chief of Staff Bradley assured that the Army will support the ongoing unification plan of the armed forces under the leadership of Secretary of Defense Johnson.</p>
<p>Bradley said: "Because we recognize that the best role played by the Army is in the unified national defense plan, we are pleased to choose the following slogan for the 1949 Army Day: 'The U.S. Army—a part of the Department of Defense—is for security.'" Bradley said that this year is the 22nd week of commemorating Army Day, but he will recommend ending this Army Day. He continued: "If we can eliminate the competition caused by these festivals by canceling Army Day, Navy Day, and Air Force Day, then we may join hands in a single National Security Day." Secretary of the Navy Sullivan and Secretary of the Air Force Symington also issued statements praising the Army's mission in the last war.</p>
<p>General Clay, commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces in Europe, said in a message prepared to be delivered on Army Day that the Berlin Airlift has clearly demonstrated the unity of purpose and spirit of cooperation of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.</p>
<p>Bradley Advocates Strengthening Western European Border Defenses; Past Conservative Military Strategies Should Be Abandoned</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 5th] Army Chief of Staff Bradley delivered an important speech tonight, revealing some of the U.S. Army authorities' military strategy planning. Bradley advocated military assistance to Western Europe to prevent aggression from ravaging the European continent as early as possible. There is a prevailing idea that if the Soviet Union wants to occupy Europe, no one can stop it. The United States can only launch air strikes and then lead a counterattack to resolve the situation in Europe. Bradley does not agree, believing that this kind of military strategy will disappoint and demoralize the allies in Europe. With the authorization of the State Department, Bradley publicly expressed his views on the military significance of the North Atlantic Treaty, saying, "In terms of military strategy, this alliance allows the free nations of Europe and America to use American strength to strengthen the European defense line to deal with aggression. The current balance of power is concentrated 3,000 miles outside the heart of Europe, in the United States. The American people must understand that if our military strategy for Europe requires us to give up first and then allow us to liberate, then the allies in Europe cannot help us. If the balance of power in Europe depends on our bombers, and its reserve strength exists on the north shore of the Atlantic, then there is no other military strategy to speak of. This kind of military strategy will only demoralize the allies in wartime, and unless the common defense plan of the free world guarantees the security of Western Europe, it is impossible to expect the people of the allied countries to sacrifice their lives for communism. As far as I know, it is best to invest in Western European border defenses in a timely manner to create a sense of security." Bradley said that the North Atlantic Treaty is a document to ensure peace. The Soviet Union accused the treaty of being hostile, only to vent its anger for being blamed. After the treaty was established, the Cold War was no longer something to be feared. Free countries need not worry about not having help when resisting aggression. In short, the treaty is as important to American security as the atomic bomb. As a soldier, I do not want to discuss too much before the Senate discusses the treaty, but there is something I must say. The treaty is complementary to our country's military strength, and the American people should listen to the honest opinions of public servants. If Western Europe does not exist, the New World will be isolated."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bad Kreuznach, 5th] General Collins, aide to Army Chief of Staff Bradley, declared here tonight: The main goal of the U.S. military is to organize a highly mobile combat force as soon as possible to prevent any eventuality. The team will consist of 5,000 people and can be used to quickly occupy enemy bases that bomb the United States once a war breaks out.</p>
<p>MacArthur Issues a Message to U.S. Troops in the Far East; U.S. Garrison in Tokyo Holds Review Ceremony</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 6th] Allied forces and U.S. troops held a grand review at the Imperial Palace Plaza in Tokyo on U.S. Army Day. Major General Almond, Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces, accepted the salute of 1,500 people on behalf of MacArthur and read MacArthur's brief message. The planned air force flyover was canceled due to bad weather. Soviet representative to the Allied Council, Derevyanko, did not attend, only sending a minor official.</p>
<p>[New Asia, Tokyo, 6th] April 6th is U.S. Army Day. MacArthur issued a message to all officers and soldiers of the U.S. forces stationed in the Far East on the morning of the 6th, roughly stating: "U.S. officers and soldiers have established a tradition of honor and sacrifice through the history of combat and peace. This tradition has become a part of the American national tradition. I hope that you will further implement this ideal and fulfill your responsibilities. I am confident that you will not shy away from the mission that you are responsible for."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] Lieutenant General Walker, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Japan, said in a broadcast to various parts of the Far East on the Army radio station here today: The next "Hitler" will attack the United States first, and will not make the mistake of attacking weak countries. Walker said that in the past two world wars, the invaders failed because they all made a big mistake, that is, they attacked weak countries first. This not only depleted their own strength but also gave the United States time to convert civilian industries into military industries. Walker continued, saying that the United States has never adopted a policy of being prepared for any eventuality. If this policy had been adopted earlier, both world wars might have been avoided. In addition, the American occupation forces here paraded on the streets today to celebrate U.S. Army Day.</p>

The message continued, stating that the return of these two regions is the opinion of the local people and is related to world peace and the security of East Africa.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza delivered a speech at a luncheon meeting of the American Journalists Association today, stating that in order to grant independence to the various ethnic groups in Africa, Africa should not be managed as a colony, and Italy must be allowed to participate in Africa's economic development. As for the establishment of the Atlantic Pact, the Soviet Union should be satisfied, because if Europe cannot unite for one day, world peace cannot be truly achieved for one day.</p>
<h3>Karen Rebel Army in Burma Surrenders; Ceasefire Agreement Signed with the Government; Rebel Leader U Chit Expresses Willingness to Support Thakin Nu</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Rangoon, 6th] U Chit, chairman of the Karen National Defense Organization, said on the 6th that the Karen rebellion has ended and that he will support the Burmese government. U Chit told reporters that he and Prime Minister Thakin Nu have reached an agreement on "all points," indicating that Thakin Nu may continue to rule the country with non-partisan members of his cabinet, rather than seek the support of the Communist Party. U Chit continued that he called on all front lines to cease fire, and commanders in various places have complied, saying that the Karen rebellion has ended because the Karen people have obtained everything they wanted through war.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rangoon, 6th] Even if the ceasefire between the Burmese government and the Karen rebel army is successful, peace cannot be immediately restored throughout Burma. Communist rebel armies and irregular People's Volunteer Organizations are still opposing the government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 5th] Pro-government reports say that Karen rebel leader U Chit arrived in Rangoon today under protection to sign the surrender agreement.

<h3>Pacific Pact May Be Signed This Autumn</h3>
<p>Commonwealth Conference a Prelude to the Alliance Treaty</p>
<p>[United Press International, Ottawa, 5th] The Canadian government believes that the Commonwealth Conference in London is mainly a prelude to the Southwest Pacific regional security pact. According to reports from London, when Commonwealth politicians meet on April 21, the only issue that will require a major decision is the future national status of India. Diplomats here believe that once this issue is resolved, India will join forces with Australia, New Zealand, and other continental Asian countries to form a regional security pact under the United Nations. Canada's note to the Soviet Union on the 4th bluntly denied that the North Atlantic Treaty was an "aggressive pact," which is believed to be based on the legality of regional pacts under the United Nations Charter. Some suggest that the Pacific Pact may be signed this autumn. They say this will be the first major diplomatic offensive by democratic countries in Asia to prevent the Communist Party from controlling the Asian continent.</p>

<h3>U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Secret Meeting Discusses the North Atlantic Treaty; Truman to Formally Request Congressional Approval</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a 90-minute secret meeting today to discuss the North Atlantic Treaty. Committee Chairman Connally declined to reveal when the treaty would be submitted to the Senate for approval. President Truman is expected to submit both the North Atlantic Treaty and a supplemental military aid bill to Congress simultaneously after the military aid bill is finalized. The North Atlantic Treaty stipulates that it will only take effect after ratification by the seven founding nations: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The U.S. Constitution requires a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to ratify treaties with foreign countries. While the treaty does not require approval from the House of Representatives, the supplemental military aid bill does. Military experts estimate the cost of this military aid to be $2 billion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The U.S. government hopes that the Senate will soon approve the North Atlantic Treaty, allowing it to take effect quickly. The global reaction to the treaty indicates that the division between East and West has become more severe as a result. Radio Moscow has launched further attacks on the treaty, accusing its initiators of attempting to start a new war.</p>

<h3>Two Major Fires Erupt Consecutively on Jiaozhou Road: Conflicts During Rescue Result in Injuries to Many Police Officers; Two Residents Killed, One Injured While Fleeing, More Than Two Hundred Straw Sheds and Wooden Houses Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A major fire broke out in the straw sheds on Yuyao Road, No. 458 Lane, west of Jin'yuan Park on Jiaozhou Road in western Shanghai, at approximately 3:58 PM yesterday. After receiving the news, the Fire Brigade rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. At the same time, the privately run Hu'xi Fire Brigade also dispatched fire trucks to assist. However, the area consisted of straw sheds and wooden houses, the water source was far away, and the order was chaotic, resulting in the burning of about 200 shacks. After receiving the report, the Jiangning Police Sub-bureau, led by the Sub-bureau Chief Li Wenjun, personally led Chief Lin and all the police officers to the scene to suppress the situation. The fire was completely extinguished at approximately 5 PM. When the fire was raging, firefighters were interfered with for no reason by unidentified individuals, and police officers from the Jiangning Police Sub-bureau were assaulted. After Sub-bureau Chief Li of the Sub-bureau tried his best to persuade them, and the Second Squadron of Flying Fortress stationed in the Sub-bureau dispatched two platoons to maintain order, the situation began to ease.</p>
<p>It is reported that the cause of the quarrel was that members of the voluntary fire brigade organized by Yuan Changsheng and Zhao Qingjin, the two Bao chiefs of No. 37 and 38 on Jinjia Lane, Jiaozhou Road, were not wearing uniforms and only wore white steel helmets. They insisted on snatching the fire hose from the fire department to put out the fire, which was rejected by the firefighters, resulting in an argument. Shortly after, Wang Yushu, a tricycle driver from a shack household in the fire scene, was electrocuted and died. When members of the voluntary fire brigade went forward to drag the body, they were seen by two police officers from the Jiangning Sub-bureau, No. 335 and No. 2741, who feared that they would be affected by the current and went forward to dissuade them, which caused another misunderstanding and a conflict occurred. At the scene, Yan Fenglou and Qian 　, the two squad leaders of the Flying Fortress, and police officers Zang Daquan, Tao Chi, Shu Yuewang, and Zhao Chongzhi were seriously injured by wooden sticks. Yan had three front teeth knocked out, and the glass of the red police car was also smashed. At that time, the Jiangning Police Bureau arrested sixteen perpetrators, including Yao Wencai, Wang Qiaolin, Zhou Zhihai, and Song Xiaolan. The main culprit, Zhang Shiyou, is at large. The injured police officers were immediately sent to the police hospital. Subsequently, it was found that the fire starter was Li Guangfu, nicknamed Little Leper, but he had fled with his family of three to avoid punishment. (Li was a worker in the Public Works Bureau). At that time, a citizen, Li Yongyu, was injured after jumping from a building, and an old man of 74 years old, Chen Shuangquan, fainted and died. Unexpectedly, at 7:28 PM, another fire suddenly broke out about 150 feet opposite the west end of the fire scene. The fire was completely extinguished at 9:05 PM after firefighters worked hard to rescue it. Fourteen wooden houses, from No. 61 to No. 75, and about 50 straw sheds were destroyed.</p>

<h3>Artificial Limbs Are Ingenious: Enable People with Disabilities to Move Freely; Whether It Is A Broken Arm Or Leg, It Is As Normal As Ordinary People to Take Things, Walk And Sit</h3>
<p>[Special Feature of Our Newspaper] Broken limbs and disabled legs are a great misfortune in life. Once a person is disabled, it is not only extremely painful for themselves, but also a burden to society. Modern scientists with compassionate hearts have taken this into consideration and studied how to enable people with disabilities to move freely, support themselves without the help of others. Therefore, there are inventions of artificial limbs. After the end of the First European War, there were disabled people all over the European and American continents. Artificial limbs have been widely used and become more and more perfect.</p>
<p>The so-called artificial limb, in layman's terms, is a false hand or foot. Some are made of wood, some are made of leather, and the newest ones are made of an aluminum alloy called Duralurin. This metal is very light and very strong. After it is made, the outside is sprayed with flesh-colored oil paint, and the shape is like the hands and feet of models displayed in the store windows.</p>
<p>There Is A Spring In The Middle</p>
<p>Whether it is a prosthetic hand or a prosthetic foot, they are hollow. The prosthetic foot is shaped like a long boot, divided into types for residual legs above the knee and residual legs below the knee. There is no mystery in the installation method. The prosthetic foot of the residual leg above the knee is put on the remaining thigh, and a special strap connecting the steel joints on the prosthetic foot is put to the neck and tightly tied to the upper body and back. There is a spring in the center of the knee of the prosthetic foot, which can sit and walk freely, and can kneel without pain. The prosthetic foot for the residual leg below the knee is similar, and is tightly tied to the thigh of the disabled person with a leather strap. Prosthetic hands are usually made of light wood or leather. Depending on the situation of the broken arm, if it is completely broken, a shoulder strap is tightly set on the upper body; if it is half-broken, it is tied to the upper arm. A strong spring is installed inside the thumb, which can be opened and closed freely to pick up small objects.</p>
<p>Installation Cost Is Expensive</p>
<p>When making prosthetic hands and feet, the disabled person must first sit or lie flat on the paper, draw the size and thickness of the broken leg, and then use plaster to shape it so that the measurement can be accurate. It is also necessary to match the suspenders or leather straps according to each person's figure. Experienced technicians are required during installation to ensure that they fit well and move freely.</p>
<p>There is a Tiangong Foreign Firm on Jing'an Temple Road in this city, specializing in the manufacture and assembly of artificial limbs. It is said that the manufacture and assembly of each artificial hand or foot takes about two weeks. The metal prosthetic foot for the residual leg above the knee costs about 220 US dollars per piece, the prosthetic foot for the residual leg below the knee costs about 150 US dollars per piece, and the prosthetic hand costs about 200 US dollars per piece. Therefore, although it is said to be "ingenious", it is not something that poor people can afford.</p>

<h3>Outgoing Public Utilities Bureau Director Takes Family to the United States by Ship</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The former Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Zengjue, has taken his family to the United States on the President Cleveland ship yesterday, and the return date has not been determined. Zhao was ordered to preside over the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau after the victory during the tenure of Mayor Qian, until he resigned on the 21st of last month, for a total of three and a half years. During his term, he worked in a down-to-earth manner and fully promoted the public utilities in this city. Except for the price increase problem, which inevitably caused criticism from the citizens, his service spirit was praised by both Chinese and foreign people. However, the shooting of Zhong Quanzhou in the labor dispute of the public bus company caused complaints from the outside world. Although Zhao was not directly responsible, he was inevitably criticized by society because of his position as the supervisor. Surrounded by such an environment, Zhao firmly sought to leave and further went to the United States with his family. It is also learned that the central authorities recently intended to give him a directorship in a certain ministry, but he had no intention of pursuing an official career and wanted to go to the United States for sightseeing, so he did not accept it.</p>

The amount of Kailuan coal arriving in Shanghai in one week has reached 30,000 tons. It is expected that by the 16th of this month, 100,000 tons of coal will be transported to Shanghai. Therefore, there will be no problem with the coal supply in the city this month. Most shipping companies are willing to participate in coal transportation work. The rumor that there is a shortage of coal transportation vessels is not true.</p>

<h3>Inspecting Southern Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>"Taihu Lake is 800 li in circumference," this sentence, like "Taihu Lake is 36,000 hectares," describes the vastness of Taihu Lake's area. In fact, Taihu Lake is indeed very wide. Its surroundings include six counties: Wuxing, Changxing, Yixing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Wujiang, spanning the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Looking out over Taihu Lake, there is no end in sight, like the ocean. Of course, because people's field of vision is limited, it can be considered vast.</p>
<p>From Wuxing to Taihu Lake, you must take a boat on the inner river for more than 20 li to Xiaomeikou or Daqiankou. These are the two largest openings along the coast of Taihu Lake. Xiaomeikou is a "three-family village" with only a dozen households. From Xiaomei, sail into the lake for about 20 li to reach a small island. This small island is less than two square li in area. It is called "Xiaoliumushan" and is empty. Only moss and weeds grow on the top of the stone, and wild gulls rest on it. When the boat approaches "Xiaoliumu," the flock of birds flies away, which is very beautiful. Another 50 li up is a large island. This island is called "Xishan," with markets, shops, houses, and buildings. Another 20 li up is another large island, called "Dongshan," which is also a place for the gathering and dispersal of lake products, and where merchants trade. These two mountains are rich in loquats, bayberries, peaches, pomegranates, etc. There is also "Shigushan," which is also a scenic area. If you go further up, the peaks in the lake rise abruptly, which is spectacular. Passing this, you can go straight to Wuxi.</p>
<p>A local at "Xiaomei" told the reporter: Taihu Lake has 36 famous islands and 72 unnamed islands. The so-called unnamed islands probably refer to unnamed peaks. There are many other hidden reefs at the bottom of the lake. If you are not careful, boats and ships are very likely to hit the reefs and sink. Moreover, "Taihu Lake has three-foot waves without wind." When the wind is strong and the waves are high, if you are not familiar with the waters of Taihu Lake, it is difficult to move an inch. According to locals: the depth of Xiaomei Port is two to eight feet, and the depth in the lake is more than two fathoms. Traffic on the lake relies on merchant ships, which travel back and forth from Wuxi to Wuxing, and from Xishan to Wuxing.</p>
<p>The ships in Taihu Lake are graded by the mast: generally, the first grade has three to four masts, the second grade has five masts, and the third grade has seven masts. The first-grade ships enter the port to berth, while the second and third-grade ships stay in Taihu Lake and do not enter the port. When a strong wind and waves come, they raise the masts and sails and go with the wind. Most of these ships make a living by fishing. In spring, they catch sturgeon, in summer, they catch whitebait, and in autumn and winter, they catch large fish. These sturgeon, whitebait, and large fish are very delicious and are specialties among domestic aquatic products. Each boat can probably exchange the fish caught every day for a dan of rice money, but they cannot fish when it rains or there is no wind. They have to rest for more than ten days a month.</p>
<p>The fishermen's total income is divided into three uses: three-tenths for eating, four-tenths for repairing boats, and three-tenths for offering sacrifices to heaven. They are very superstitious about "heaven," believing that their lives in the lake are completely entrusted to the heavens, and that the warmth and food they receive are also bestowed by the heavens. Fishermen do not stay overnight on the shore but live in boats. Fishermen also do not marry outsiders (i.e., non-fishermen). It is said that there is a lone tree on a hill in Xiaomei. Every summer, a giant python coils around the tree and roars. The fishermen regard it as a god and Buddha and burn incense and worship.</p>
<p>Fishermen rarely have the opportunity to receive education because they must set off to fish when the wind comes and cannot study every day. Wealthy fishermen hire teachers to teach the children on the boats, but most of the teachers they hire are old-fashioned teachers who do not know new science and new knowledge.</p>
<p>There are 160 fishing boats entering the port of Xiaomei, which are organized into one bao, with Wang Genfu as the bao chief. Wang himself has seven boats. In the Xiaomei and Daqian areas, he is known as Bao Chief Wang. Bao Chief Wang's reputation resounds in southern Taihu Lake. All the boats in Taihu Lake have to buy him some credit, and everyone listens to his words. It is said that there is another person like Chief Bao in northern Taihu Lake. With these two in northern and southern Taihu Lake, the security of Taihu Lake is much better.</p>
<p>According to people in Taihu Lake: "There are no bandits in Taihu Lake at all, but bandits live scattered along the coast of Taihu Lake. Whenever they have a chance, they go into Taihu Lake to loot, and then return to the shore to live as gentlemen. The targets of looting are of course merchant ships and the like. The former 'Tai Bao A Shu' was like that. Now southern Taihu Lake is considered very peaceful. Although there are times when people emerge in Taihu Lake flying the flag of the Communist army, they have not come to southern Taihu Lake."</p>
<p>If you go deep into Taihu Lake, you will naturally encounter them. If they see you looking unfamiliar, they may make you embarrassed and uncomfortable. When the reporter sailed from Xiaomei to inspect southern Taihu Lake, it was a day of bright sunshine, gentle breeze, and the lake was as flat as a mirror. According to the locals, such calm weather has been rare in the past two months. As we returned from southern Taihu Lake to Xiaomei, we saw a setting sun, with the evening glow covering half the sky, reflected in the lake as a golden light, gradually as the sun set in the west and the night mist enveloped the entire lake. On the boundless horizon, suddenly a silver-white horizontal line circled the vast lake.</p>
<p>Taihu Lake is lovely because it provides convenient cultivation and irrigation for the counties near Taihu Lake. Because of it, tens of thousands of fishermen rely on their lives. We should make these irrigation projects more advantageous by using the most scientific methods. We should enable these many fishermen to receive the education that citizens should receive, and we should further improve the rural environment along the coast of Taihu Lake and the unreasonable lives of the fishermen. If we want to do this, we must live on the coast of Taihu Lake or on a boat on Taihu Lake for a period of time, become familiar with their living conditions, and then gradually improve it through patient persuasion.</p>

<h3>Chen Zhanshan Blood Case: A Chorus of Demands for the Arrest of the Murderer</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Xi'an on the 1st] After Chen Zhanshan, the former secretary of the Chenggu County Council in Shaanxi Province, was murdered, his wife, in order to oppose the local judicial authorities' transfer of the Chen case to the jurisdiction of Xi'an, wrote an article pursuing the murderer. The last paragraph of her original manuscript was particularly stern and righteous. The text of Mrs. Chen's original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Chinese people still have a conscience. At the beginning of the tragedy, they received the support of 200,000 people and the support of fair, conscientious, and bloody people from all over the world, as well as the attention of all levels of agencies to this tragedy. From November 36, the provincial government sent inspector Wang Xiangquan and the Greater District Security Commander Ci Derang, together with more than ten agencies and sixty witnesses, to investigate for three months and two days, and found the murderer. Except for the fugitives Wang Wende and Wei Ziyu, the rest, such as the principal offender Meng Ruotong, Yu Xianzhou, the accomplice Hou Linbin, and the murderers Luo Tianhe, Lian Chengbi, and Lei Mingxing, have all been arrested one after another. After continuous investigation, Meng Ruotong and Yu Xianzhou were sentenced to life imprisonment for instigating murder and deprived of their political rights for life. Luo Tianhe, Lian Chengwang, and Lei Mingxing were sentenced to death for committing murder together and deprived of their political rights for life. Elders of Chenggu! Urgently hope that the murderer will be brought to justice, and further expect the law enforcement authorities to impose the death penalty on the principal offender!</p>
<p>What is most heartbreaking is that not long after the judgment was announced, when her husband Chen Zhanshan's coffin had not yet been buried, the murderers Meng Ruotong and others deceived the Supreme Court and obtained permission to transfer jurisdiction. Duan Shaojiu, the president of the Nanzheng High Branch Court, disregarded national law, disregarded the people, and was not afraid of public opinion. Taking the opportunity of transferring jurisdiction, he released Meng Ruotong on January 28 of this year and Yu Xianzhou on February 25. As a result, the murderers acted unscrupulously in Nanzheng, flaunting themselves on the market all day long, and did not extinguish their prestige of that year. After she appealed to the court, they restrained themselves. Are these criminals? Are these murderers sentenced to life imprisonment? Are these murderers deprived of their political rights for life?</p>
<p>Her husband Chen Zhanshan was murdered for exposing corruption. The government solved the case and handed it over to the court for trial. The government's responsibility cannot be considered over. It should be the beginning of supervision and should not be ignored, so that the victim's grievances will not be cleared!</p>
<p>Now, the first thing to say about this case is that there is no need to transfer it. The victim is from Chenggu. The judges and judges of the Nanzheng High Branch Court are all foreigners (not only are there no Chenggu people, but there are no people from southern Shaanxi). There is no need for recusal. Secondly, it cannot be transferred:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the impact of the war in Xi'an, various agencies have moved south one after another, and prisoners have been dispersed. Nanzheng should be safer. However, the court transferred the major criminals Meng Ruotong and Yu Xianzhou to Xi'an, a combat zone. Is it more difficult to communicate than Nanzheng to be more insured?</p>
<p>(2) The High Court also feels that Xi'an is unsafe and has set up an office in Nanzheng. It feels that it cannot stand on its own! How can the prisoners be transferred there?</p>
<p>(3) If this case is transferred to Xi'an, the fifty or sixty witnesses all have jobs. Under the whip of life, they cannot even guarantee their own lives. How can they have the time and money to testify?</p>
<p>(4) Her husband Chen Zhanshan has served for half his life and left behind orphans and widows, debts, and the burden of living. The lives of the living are on the verge of despair. How can they raise travel expenses!</p>
<p>(5) Even if Nian Ci is eager to avenge her husband, she begs for food to pursue the murderer. Meng Ruotong and Yu Xianzhou have many accomplices. Since they can kill her husband, who will be responsible for Nian Ci's safety on the road?</p>
<p>(6) If a war breaks out in Xi'an, can the court guarantee the safety of the prisoners?</p>
<p>Based on the above points, this case not only cannot be transferred, but it is also unnecessary to transfer it. However, the High Court is now transferring it, which implies that it is sheltering and facilitating the release of the prisoners. It is not difficult to imagine this. I specifically ask your newspaper to report the grievances of the weak who have no one to appeal to, and to urge the law enforcement authorities to leave a little dignity for the law! Return the major criminals Meng Yu and others to Nanzheng for trial, so that the grievances can be cleared as soon as possible, and both the living and the dead will be grateful.</p>
<h3>A Soldier Strangled to Death Outside the Hanbeimen Gate in Changshu</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Changshu on the 5th] A body of an unknown male wearing a yellow uniform was suddenly found in the river outside the Baishen Nunnery outside the Hanbeimen Gate in Taici Town on the 4th. He was about thirty years old. The town police Li Huanzhang stopped it and reported it to the District Prosecutor's Office for examination. There was a photo of a graduation certificate from the Township Cadre Training Institute of the Executive Yuan Pacification District Political Affairs Committee, an identity card of Miao Wei (with the address of No. 5, Jia 4, Bao 1, Pingqiao Township, Huaian County, military sector), two military symbols (one named Wang Linhua, one named Lin Wei), a leather wallet, in the deceased's pocket, with a page of red wrapping paper from Nantong Lao Tianbao Jewelry Store (with the words "3.52 qian of pure gold Tianyuan ring" written in pen), an envelope (addressed to Mr. Miao Xia, No. 503 Chaoyue Building, Rehe Road, Xiaguan, Nanjing), and on the loose-leaf diary in the leather wallet, there was the handwriting of Miss Fan Suzhen, No. 139 Baota Road, Zhenjiang. In addition, there were two seals made of ox horn and crystal, both engraved with the words Miao Wei. After examining the male corpse in public, there were four rope marks around the neck, surrounding him, and there were no traces of silt in the fingertips. It was determined that he was strangled to death before he died and thrown into the river after his death. The examination report was prepared and attached to the file. The corpse was ordered to be collected and temporarily stored by the town police in charge, with a marker inserted, waiting for the relatives of the corpse to claim it. All the confiscated items were kept in the case.</p>

<p>Shouchang</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] On the early morning of March 25, the county was captured by more than 200 local Communist Jin Xiao detachments from the east, south, and north gates due to the weakness of the military police force. More than ten military police and civilians were killed or injured, and public property losses were heavy. The county government, police bureau, and prison were all burned down. The provincial bank, local court, telecommunications bureau, warehouse, and health center were looted. The losses of shops and homes were relatively light. Several telephones were looted, and items such as rubber shoes and flashlights were borrowed. Fortunately, the national army arrived on the evening of the same day, and the local Communists had already retreated to the countryside an hour earlier.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation Economic Compulsion Leads to Great Mistake Beloved Wife and Son Given Away</h3>
<p>Answered by Lawyer Jiang Pingfan</p>
<p>Li Zhong asks: Friend A has a girlfriend B. In 1946, due to job-related contacts, she and A became lovers. Later, they had a physical relationship, and she became pregnant. In the summer of the same year, B's parents ordered B to marry C. B then conspired with A to elope. However, A failed due to economic constraints, and B refused to tell her parents about this fact. As a result, B married C, and A and B still got along as friends. After B married C, she gave birth to a boy in less than five months. At this time, C learned about the relationship between A and B. A also told the truth and asked to recognize the child. B promised to hand the child over to A after the full month because C did not want the child. However, after the full month, B's parents gave the child to someone else because it was inconvenient for both parties to raise the child. May I ask: (1) Can A file a request with the court to recognize the illegitimate child? (2) If B refuses to provide evidence submitted by A, will the court accept it? (3) If the child has indeed been given to someone else, what should be done? (4) If B counterclaims that A committed rape or enticement, can it be established? (5) Who is the other party in the lawsuit in court? [Answer] (1) A can file a lawsuit with the court to recognize the illegitimate child. (2) If B denies it, A should submit evidence to the court. Whether the evidence is adopted should be determined by the court. (3) If the child has been given to someone else, A can also file a lawsuit to recognize the illegitimate child. (4) Rape is a criminal matter and should be reported by B. It must be proved that there was force, coercion, or other methods to make it impossible to resist and commit adultery before it can be established. The lawsuit to recognize the illegitimate child is a civil matter and cannot be counterclaimed. (5) The opposing party in the lawsuit is B.</p>

<h3>National Action Using Own Foreign Exchange to Purchase Large Amounts of Gold from the US</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] According to Central Bank Business Bureau Director Lin Chongyong's statement to reporters yesterday, the national bank has indeed used its own foreign exchange to purchase a large amount of gold from the United States at the official price (note: the official price of gold in the United States is $35 per ounce). It is now being shipped to Shanghai in batches to replenish the national bank's gold reserves and stabilize gold prices in the long term. When asked by reporters about rumors that the national bank had recently shipped back a large amount of gold from South China, Lin replied, "I do not wish to comment on this matter."</p>
<h3>Gold Market Stagnant Inside, Active Trading Outside</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] Yesterday, trading in the gold market was stagnant. Due to the upper limit restriction, it was greatly disconnected from the off-market price. Buying and selling were in a wait-and-see state in the morning, and no formal trading opened until noon. In the afternoon, the opening price rose to the upper limit of 1.32 million, remaining there until closing. Only one large transaction was concluded, up 220,000 from the previous day, equivalent to 2 yuan in interest.</p>
<p>Off-Market</p>
<p>Off-market trading was lively, with "matching" groups actively buying and selling. The opening price in the morning was relatively stable, quoted at 1.5 million and 1.55 million. Securities firms and large investors bought gold, creating strong buying momentum that pushed prices up to 1.6 million and 1.65 million. Around noon, the Central Bank sold off some gold at high prices, secretly releasing over 2,000 taels. Individual investors also started selling, and the market softened, with the noon closing price falling slightly to 1.43 million and 1.48 million.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, due to tight credit conditions, unofficial interest rates rose again to around 3 yuan, dampening sentiment and weakening the upward momentum. The opening price was 1.42 million and 1.47 million, and short covering slightly boosted prices to 1.45 million and 1.5 million. The closing price then fell again to 1.412 million and 1.47 million, down 120,000 from the previous day. The overnight interest rate increased by 220,000 per tael, with prices quoted as high as 1.64 million and 1.69 million.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry</p>
<p>Yesterday, gold jewelry shops resumed price listings around 11 a.m., with buying prices at 1.44 million and selling prices at 1.6 million. The afternoon prices remained unchanged, up 160,000 from the previous listing. Silver jewelry also rose by 3,000, reaching highs of 16,000 and 20,000. Money exchange shops did not list prices in the morning, but in the afternoon, the buying price was 1.35 million and the selling price was 1.55 million.</p>
<p>US Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading in US dollars remained scarce. The opening price in the morning was 32,000 and 34,000, rising to 33,000 and 35,000, and falling to 28,000 and 30,000. The noon closing price was 32,000 and 34,000. In the afternoon, prices stabilized. The opening price was 32,000 and 34,000, briefly rising to 36,500 and 34,500, before falling again to 36,000 and 34,000 at the close. The trend was firm, with little change from the previous day. The overnight interest rate increased by 4,500, with prices quoted as high as 36,500 and 38,500. Street trading was chaotic, with cash transactions quoted at 30,000 and 32,000.</p>
<p>Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were not many silver dollar arbitrage transactions. Approximately 1 million was arbitrated out of South China, and another 1.5 million was arbitrated out of West China and North China. The exchange rate was as high as 8 yuan and as low as 6 yuan per 100 yuan. Street trading was brisk due to the unstable situation, with active repatriation of funds from various parties. Securities firms and money exchange shops were actively seeking silver dollars. In the morning, "big heads" were quoted at 26,000 and 27,000, and in the afternoon, they rushed to cross the three levels, rising from 27,000 and 28,000 to 28,000 and 29,000. "Small heads" were quoted at 22,000 and 23,000, and "eagle dragon" dollars were quoted at 17,000 and 18,000, a jump of 5,000 from the previous day. Transactions of bank drafts with "big heads" opened in the morning at 28,000 and 29,000, and in the afternoon, each reached as high as 31,000 and 32,000.</p>
<h3>Bulls and Bears Grapple Again, Shanghai Stocks Slightly Up</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] Yesterday's Shanghai stock market was almost entirely surrounded by bearish sentiment amid tight credit conditions. Although major investors tried their best to push prices up, the prohibition of same-day check clearing tightened market credit. Although the tight credit situation was not as dire as the previous day, unofficial interest rates remained high, and off-market interest rates for Yong Yarn also opened high at 140-145 yuan. Bulls could not withstand the pressure of high interest rates, and buying momentum decreased sharply. Yong Yarn opened in the morning at 23.4 yuan, and major investors continued to support it, immediately rising to 25.1 yuan. The overnight floating shorts continued, and off-market bearish sentiment enveloped the market, making it impossible to maintain support on the trading floor. The market softened frequently, closing the morning at 23.9 yuan.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized stocks remained relatively firm. Xinyi, Xinguang, and Zhongnong Bank were vigorously promoted, and ultimately all closed at their upper limits. Meiya, Jingfu, and Dongxing all rose after opening, but weakened at the close. Tongyi and Guohuo also saw their upper limits due to behind-the-scenes support. Zhenhua was the only stock that fell to its lower limit. The performance of other stocks varied.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yong Yarn initially opened at 23 yuan, but off-market prices had already risen to 25.7 yuan and 26.2 yuan, improving sentiment. Strong buying covered on the trading floor, and prices rose to 25 yuan. As the closing approached, off-market prices gradually fell, and short-term bulls sold off, causing the market to soften slightly, closing at 24.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Record Number of Returned Checks</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] Yesterday, most banks and financial institutions in the city continued to suspend same-day check clearing, and most industries and markets remained in a state of semi-paralysis. As the implementation of suspending same-day clearing began a few days ago, the check clearing results broke the unprecedented record of "eight returns out of ten checks." The city was filled with returned check notices, truly a strange phenomenon seen only in the city's financial market after the victory.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the total value of returned checks from the clearing results a few days ago exceeded 70 billion yuan, accounting for one-third of the total clearing value that day. If the bank draft portion of the cleared checks is excluded and only the cleared checks are calculated, the value of returned checks accounted for 80% of the total value of cleared checks.</p>
<h3>Market Ramblings</h3>
<p>---</p>
<p>Rental Rates Should Follow the Index - What's the Logic Behind This?</p>
<p>A news report stated that rental rates can be adjusted according to the index, a suggestion from the city councilor gentlemen. If this news is true, please have the councilor gentlemen come forward and elaborate on their wise opinions so that all sectors of society and all citizens can fairly judge. Rental rates should not be adjusted according to the index, as I already stated in the March 30th issue of this newspaper. I may be insignificant, but reason should not be determined by a person's status.</p>
<p>Rental rates should not be adjusted according to the index because real estate is property, not a commodity. Businesses selling goods must price them based on the replacement cost. Employees selling their labor must calculate wages based on the cost of living needed to sustain that labor. Money lenders must appropriately raise interest rates to compensate for the loss in currency value upon repayment. However, interest rates do not follow the index because the principal of the loan must still be repaid.</p>
<p>The sale of real estate must be priced based on the replacement cost, so real estate prices also follow general price levels, and no one has ever objected to that.</p>
<p>However, when renting out real estate, the property rights still belong to the owner, and they do not need to replace anything at market prices. Therefore, rental rates should not follow general price levels.</p>
<p>If rental rates were to follow the index, then the value of the property they own would increase with prices, and rental rates would also increase with prices. This would be equivalent to selling goods without delivering them, while continuously demanding increased profits from the buyer based on the market price. Where in the world is there such logic? I ask the city councilor gentlemen, what is the basis for your suggestion that rental rates should follow the index? Allow us to "learn" from you!</p>
<p>If we don't talk about reason and just talk about facts, assuming that theory and fact can be unrelated, then let's talk about facts!</p>
<p>First: Let's talk about fairness. During high inflation, businesses see prices increase when they sell, but also when they buy. Prices increase at the same time, so businesses only have attractive-looking paper assets and no real profit from price increases. The real estate industry in the past was the same as general industries, but if rental rates were to follow the index, it would be very different. Not only would paper assets increase dramatically with rising real estate prices, but rental income would also increase proportionally with prices. This would be nothing less than allowing them to obtain double benefits, allowing them to uniquely obtain real windfall profits during inflation. If you call this fair, then there is no justice in the world!</p>
<p>Second: Let's talk about whether tenants can afford it. When prices rise, businesses see prices rise when they buy and when they sell. Wages are high, interest rates are high, and every household is struggling. If rental rates were to follow prices again, it would be the same as not allowing them to barely survive, strangling them in one fell swoop. As for the general public, their income wages follow the index, but their living expenses follow prices. The index lags behind prices, so everyone is spending more than they earn and suffering unspeakable hardships. I ask the councilor gentlemen, why don't you think about the city's businesses and citizens? Why do you only want to help the large landlords? There are no fewer than five or six million people in Shanghai, but large landlords number no more than two or three thousand. Why are the councilor gentlemen eager to offer their wisdom to the smallest number of people? And why are you happy to engage in this "robbing the poor to enrich the rich" activity?</p>
<p>Double Windfall Profits Are Unconscionable; You Shouldn't Rob the Poor to Help the Rich</p>
<h3>Joint Yarn and Cloth Export Plan to Be Implemented Upon Approval</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] The Six District Cotton Textile Association, concerned about the large-scale dumping of Japanese cotton products in the Southeast Asian and Indian markets, which has led to a continuous decline in the export prices of yarn and cloth and difficulties in sales, intends to unite national and private factories of all sizes to organize a joint export organization in order to address the current crisis and lay a permanent foundation for exports. The goal is to reduce unit costs under the principle of cooperation among all factories and large-scale manufacturing. At the same time, they will research technological improvements to ensure that their products meet the needs of foreign markets. To ensure smooth progress, they hope the government will provide encouragement and assistance.</p>
<p>This plan is currently only a draft and will be implemented after discussions with all industry members. Regarding a part of the report, some industry members believe that there is a tendency for large factories to deprive small factories of their rights, which is likely based on speculative misunderstandings. Joint export development is one thing, and the proxy spinning of US aid cotton is another, and the two cannot be confused.</p>
<p>The US Aid Committee and the Economic Cooperation Administration are in charge of how to fairly distribute US aid cotton, and the export organization cannot arbitrarily make decisions. Therefore, the establishment of a joint export organization will not affect the original US aid cotton quotas of each factory. It is heard that the draft is currently being reviewed by the association's national and private members.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Untradeable</h3>
<p>Due to the overnight check returns and the unsettled interest disputes, the cotton yarn market has not yet been fully resolved, so trading cannot be started. However, there were some offers for 21-count double horse yarn, with prices at 5.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Paralyzed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was paralyzed. The market authorities initially announced to all industry members that all payments for transactions must be made in cash or bank drafts. If disputes arise from check payments, the association will not be responsible. Therefore, no trading opened. However, there were indeed off-market offers, with Longtou fine cloth at 200,000 yuan and Sijunzi yuan serge at 185,000 yuan, but actual transactions were scarce. Private factories have not yet started selling, and wholesale door shops are also very idle.</p>
<h3>China Textile Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>[By Our Reporter] Textile Construction Company continued to sell yarn as usual yesterday. Only one household applied to purchase one piece of 42-count double-strand Hongbao light yarn at a price of 9.9 million yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, for the more than 600 pieces of cotton yarn entrusted to Textile Construction Company by the Central Bank to be sold on Monday, both parties agreed that those who paid yesterday would pay at Monday's transaction price plus 10%. However, all payments could not be completed yesterday, and it was agreed that those who pay today would pay at Monday's transaction price plus 16%.</p>
<h3>Three Different Prices in the Market, Rice Trading Was Quiet Yesterday, Prices Did Not Exceed the 170,000 Limit</h3>
<p>The rice market's Spring Festival holiday is over, and trading resumed yesterday. However, because checks cannot be cleared on the same day, both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and trading was scarce. Prices did not exceed the limit of 170,000. There were three types of prices in the market: checks, bank drafts, and cash. The check price for white japonica rice was 168,000 yuan, the price for thin rice was 169,000 yuan, and the price for early rice was 166,000 yuan, each up by more than 10,000 yuan from before the holiday. The bank draft price was lower than the check price, and the cash price was even lower than the bank draft price. The total arrival of goods in the North and South markets was 14,032 shi.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Trading started yesterday. Because checks were not cleared on the same day, most transactions were conducted with bank drafts, and there were also some check transactions, but very few were concluded. Soybean oil was 850,000 yuan, and vegetable oil was 750,000 yuan, each up by 80-90,000 yuan from before the holiday. The price of Jietong vegetable oil was 900,000 and 880,000, up slightly by 40,000. Soybean cake rose by 8-9,000, with very few sales.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market trend turned weak due to the inability to clear checks on the same day. The market lacked bank drafts, and credit conditions remained tight, making it impossible for goods owners to sell. The market trend declined all the way from the peak. The highest price for old car flour was 65,000, retreating to the 60,000 level at the close. The price for "warship" flour once rose to 62,000, but then fell below the 60,000 level, trading at 57,700 yuan. Although it was up from last Saturday, the decline was severe compared to other off-market goods or the interest rates.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The market was filled with checks and bank drafts, and trading was chaotic. Soybeans rose by about 20% compared to last Saturday. Jiujiang winter soybeans traded at 150,000 yuan with checks. The supply and demand for raw peanuts was scarce, with less than 100 bags traded, and prices also rose by 20%. Corn rose slightly by 10%, all traded with checks. Sesame trading was not active, and red sorghum traded at 73,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball Technique</h3>
<p>— Translated and Described by Qi Gong</p>
<p>Discussion on Offensive Methods</p>
<p>The previous issue clarified the moving zone defense system and various basic formations used in women's basketball. Significant progress has been made in defensive tactics, which is the result of foreign guidance and research in recent years. However, advanced defensive tactics also require advanced offensive formations to break through the defense. Moreover, "offense is the best defense." Even if a team has an extremely solid defensive fortress, if the forwards lack sharp offensive momentum, it will be difficult to reduce the threat of enemy attacks. Even if the forwards score, it may not be enough to offset the points lost by the defense, resulting in a net loss. Therefore, no team that is good at defense but not good at offense can be sure of winning.</p>
<p>Military strategy says, "Those who are good at offense make the enemy not know what to defend." It also says, "Offense is the basis of defense, and defense is the strategy of offense - subtle, so subtle, to the point of being formless; mysterious, so mysterious, to the point of being soundless, so one can control the enemy's fate." This means that to maintain control of the overall situation, one must have sound defense and also skillful offense. Those who are good at offense can make the enemy come together and separate, gather and scatter, scheming in secret and planning meticulously, so that one can take the initiative everywhere, strategizing before the keyhole and determining victory and defeat under the important area of the basket. This is the kind of tactical play that a mature team can adopt in offense. If an immature team cannot even use simple screen plays skillfully and has not mastered basic movements correctly, it is futile to attempt tactical play, which is no different from drawing a tiger that ends up looking like a dog.</p>
<p>Looking at the women's teams in Shanghai, only the Green Team is a mature team that has the qualifications to use tactics. If the other teams can perform simple screen plays skillfully, it is already commendable. Discussing the practice of tactics is not difficult to know, but difficult to implement. Taking Renyu as an example, they have been practicing the S.One. set of tactics for two years, but they still cannot use it satisfactorily. This shows that practicing a set of tactics requires a long period of practice. If it is a case of sudden enthusiasm followed by prolonged neglect, the result will be one inch forward and one foot back.</p>
<p>Mildred E. Anderson, a women's basketball coach at the University of Michigan, has done in-depth research on offensive tactics in women's basketball. He said: In recent times, women's basketball teams have made significant progress in zone defense. Therefore, teams must have more coordinated communication and various precise shooting techniques when attacking in order to break through the advanced moving zone defense. If relying solely on the forwards to launch attacks is not enough to break through the opponent's defensive formation, the guards must quickly pass the ball across the center line to coordinate with the forwards in launching effective attacks.</p>
<p>If the players on each team do not individually have sophisticated skills, it will be difficult to achieve good results with offensive plays. If players cannot control the ball well and cannot rebound the ball under the basket, it is no different from weakening the team's offense. Without skilled floor play and if the guards cannot quickly pass the ball across the center line, the forwards' offensive momentum cannot be enhanced.</p>
<p>Anderson explained in the article that if a team can skillfully use and keep in mind the basic techniques, it may enable the forwards and guards to cooperate skillfully and agilely to accelerate the offense. The following basic techniques are applicable regardless of whether men's rules or women's rules are used. (To be continued - A)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Silver Shield Football Final Exciting and Moving; South China Wins the Championship in Extra Time; Kitchee Once Led 3-1</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Air News] Under the bright sun, amidst elegant clothing and handsome figures, Happy Valley once again presented a scene of flowing cars and bustling crowds. It turned out to be the auspicious day for the Special Silver Shield Group A and B finals. No wonder the Hong Kong racecourse was packed with tens of thousands of people, with no empty seats.</p>
<p>The Group A final was performed at 4:00 p.m. In addition to Song Lingsheng still recovering from his injury and not participating, Zhu Yongqiang and Xie Jinhe, who were stranded in Guangzhou due to the "Peace Wheel Incident," also arrived on time, forming the most complete lineup for South China. Kitchee, in addition to the retirement of "Blind Tiger" Zhao Fu, also sent out a very strong team. As a result of the game, South China, with its long-winning record, won the Silver Shield in extra time with a score of 5-3, but they had been in an absolute disadvantage with a score of 1-3 and went through an extremely thrilling process. Kitchee's loss was due to the lack of final efforts.</p>
<p>To be fair, South China did not perform well in this battle. Slow forward progression, slow shooting, and a lack of players who dared to charge forward were all major flaws of the "long-winning army." I think if South China unfortunately loses a battle, it will be a regrettable thing that these shortcomings have not been improved.</p>
<p>Therefore, Kitchee took the lead with a score of 3-1 in the early stage of the game when the entire army was full of fighting spirit, entirely because they dared to fight and dared to charge, achieving the results of using space. Unfortunately, in the ten minutes before the end of the second half, South China scored twice in the open goal to force a tie. In extra time, they lost their previous fighting spirit and handed over the glorious and brilliant championship to the other side, retiring to the second seat, which really made the audience "slap their thighs" and sigh!</p>
<p>When South China was losing 1-3, and after attacking for a long time, they could not achieve their goals. Seeing that the game was about to end, not only did the spectators think that Kitchee could secure the victory, but also the entire South China army was in danger and despondent, kicking lazily. However, they were finally able to force a tie in the last ten minutes, and even scored two more goals in the first ten minutes of extra time to secure the victory, also showing their calm and unperturbed experience.</p>
<p>I hope that all the South China players will remember the lessons of the China United team barely winning the Memorial Cup against the Army and losing to the Western United in the Governor's Cup. In this battle, they should not be arrogant because of victory, but should humbly review their "gains" and "losses." This is a loyal admonition that concerns the future, and I hope South China will encourage themselves!</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the combat effectiveness of this battle, Kitchee had Zhu "Officer," who had been retired for a long time, and "Blackie" still played. Please see the lineup of both sides:</p>
<p>South China</p>
<p>Yu Yaode</p>
<p>Zhang Shuling Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Liu Songsheng Xie Jinhong Zhang Jinhai</p>
<p>Xie Jinhe Li Zhaorong Zhu Yongqiang Feng Jingxiang He Yingfen</p>
<p>Kitchee</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng</p>
<p>Mo Jinsong Zhen Yaohua</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan You Huaxing Li Bingzhao</p>
<p>Huang Jingsong Yao Zhuoran Guo Yingqi Zhang Songgen Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>South China Lost a Penalty Kick First</p>
<p>After the start of the game, both sides attacked and defended each other. After five minutes, "Ah Xie" got the opportunity to invade, and Shuling failed to control his rush, causing him to cut into the penalty area. Jinhong saw that the situation was critical and tripped him from behind, resulting in a penalty kick. "Chili Boy" acted as the executioner, taking a fierce kick. Although "De" blocked it with his right hand, the momentum was too strong and it was still drilled into the net. Kitchee took the lead with a score of 1-0.</p>
<p>South China was unwilling to lose and launched a large-scale counterattack. After a long battle, Jinhe tricked "Big Dog" and passed the ball to the right. It looked like it was about to go out of bounds. "Second Uncle" headed it back in front of the goal. Zhu Tsai rushed forward and headed it again. Although "Old Zhu" managed to slap it out with his hand in time, Zhu Tsai added another kick, and the ball went straight into the net like an arrow. The "Officer" was not three heads and six arms, so he had to temporarily let South China tie the score back to 1-1.</p>
<p>Kitchee Led 3-1</p>
<p>"Ah Xie" got excited and came to stir up trouble again. Shuling could not resist. He just saw him make a wonderful cross, and Songgen wanted to shoot but missed. "Liang De" had not yet taken his eyes off Songgen, when Yingqi kicked the ball into the net with lightning speed. At this point, Kitchee took the lead again with a score of 2-1.</p>
<p>After a long time in the second half, Zhuoran was seen getting the ball and dribbling into South China's hinterland. Xie and Hou came to fight together, but he still broke through the gap and shot the ball into the net, Kitchee "rejoiced" with a score of 3-1!</p>
<p>South China became more and more chaotic as they fought. Seeing that the situation was about to be settled, ten minutes before the end of the game, Zhu Tsai was seen winning the ball in the middle and taking advantage of Kitchee's vacant defense, charging forward alone. "Old Zhu" abandoned the city and rushed out. Zhu Tsai watched the route carefully and, when "Old Zhu" rushed close, gently passed the ball towards the empty goal, chasing back the score to 2-3.</p>
<p>Li Zhaorong Tied the Score</p>
<p>South China's fighting spirit only flourished after winning back this goal. They saw another wave of group attacks, Jinhe made a wonderful pass in the middle, Zhu Tsai shot fiercely near the goal, but it was blocked by Zhaohong and fell not far away, landing at the feet of Buddha. "Buddha" faced the "empty goal," unhurriedly sent the treasure in, making the score a 3-3 tie. The ninety-minute game soon ended.</p>
<p>The referee blew the whistle for extra time. Songgen was injured and could not come out, so Kitchee had to fight with only ten people at first. South China took the opportunity to attack. Zhu Tsai crossed from the baseline, and Jinhai rushed up and flicked it in. South China immediately reversed the defeat into a victory with a score of 4-3.</p>
<p>After Kitchee lost this goal, Zhang Songgen immediately returned, but Yingqi retreated to defend, thinking he could control "Second Uncle's" activity. Unexpectedly, it was of no help, and the front line was formed into a "leaderless army." In order to enhance the charging force, South China transferred Jinhai to lead the army and Yingfen to retreat to defend. Less than three minutes from winning this goal, Jinhai was again seen rushing into Kitchee's heart, and still kicked the ball from the left side with his right foot at an impossible angle, and it entered the right side, completing a 5-3 victory.</p>
<p>In the next ten minutes of the change of direction, both sides were tired and could not fight anymore, they were just delaying time in "slow motion".</p>
<p>After the end of the extra time game, the two silver medals were awarded by the Football Association Chairman Lady Morse to the captains of the Group A and B champion teams, and the silver cup was awarded to the Group A runner-up, and each of the four participating athletes was awarded a commemorative medal. South China's Yu Yaode presented a bouquet of fresh flowers to Mrs. Morse, and after the entire team shouted three cheers, this Special Silver Shield final for Group A and B ended in the twilight. (Qinglang)</p>
<h3>Bus Wins Group B Silver Medal: 3-1 Victory Over South China</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Airmail] In the Group B Silver Shield final match between Bus and South China, both sides mobilized their full strength. Bus’s red jerseys were dazzling, with star players Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, and Zhuo Shijin, along with veterans Yang Genbao, Sun Bao'an, Tan Jiajun, and Huang Ruiqi – all "quasi-Group A" athletes – taking to the field. This was unprecedented in Group B, and even exceeded the strength of many current Group A teams. South China also appeared in vibrant blue, with a strong and robust team, but a closer look at the roster revealed they were clearly less formidable.</p>
<p>As a result, Bus defeated South China 3-1, rightfully claiming the Group B Silver Shield. However, considering the situation at the time, South China's performance was not inferior to Bus on average. Were it not for goalkeeper Bao Jingxian's ineptitude, Bus would have found it difficult to win. Conversely, Bus's ability to maintain their lead was largely thanks to the stable and steadfast performance of their goalkeeper, Sun Bao'an.</p>
<p>Although named a "Group B" match, this duel was swift and exciting, rarely seen even in the Group A league. The dangerous long shots from Li Songxian and the veteran skills of the "national players" were enough to elicit endless praise from the audience.</p>
<p>In the first half, Zhuo Shijin launched a long shot, which Zhong Jingsheng headed into the net while the South China goalkeeper was flustered and at a loss. (1-0) Less than five minutes into the second half, Yang Genbao seized upon South China's ineptitude and scored with another long shot. (2-0) Later, South China's Zhu Jincheng started an attack on the flank, delivering a beautiful cross, and Li Songxian responded in kind with a long shot, making it 2-1. Finally, Bus's Tan Jiajun received the ball and passed it forward, where Zhong Jingsheng charged through the chaotic defense and scored, completing the 3-1 victory. The two lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>Bus B</p>
<p>Sun Bao'an</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng   Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>Tan Jiajun   Luo Baoshan   Huang Ruiqi</p>
<p>Chen Jinrui   Zhuo Shijin   Zhong Jingsheng   Yang Genbao   Zeng Mingquan</p>
<p>South China B</p>
<p>Bao Jingxian</p>
<p>Jian Zhien   Ruan Peiwen</p>
<p>Feng Shutang   Guo Su   Zhu Dewen</p>
<p>Zhuo Yun   Zhou Jie   He Wenjie   Li Songxian   Zhu Jincheng</p>
<h3>Hard-Court Tennis Exhibition: Hong Kong Defeats Saigon</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Airmail] The Hong Kong-Saigon tennis exhibition match, played under the Davis Cup system on hard courts at the Chinese Recreation Club, has concluded successfully, with Hong Kong defeating Saigon 3-2.</p>
<p>The results of the first day were:</p>
<p>Wen Sui</p>
<p>6-4   4-6   6-2</p>
<p>Xu Runpei</p>
<p>Ye Guanxiong</p>
<p>6-3   6-0</p>
<p>A Long</p>
<p>The results of the second day were:</p>
<p>A Long</p>
<p>6-2   6-1</p>
<p>Xu Runpei</p>
<p>Ye Guanxiong</p>
<p>8-6   6-3</p>
<p>Wen Sui</p>
<p>Ye Guanxiong   Xu Weipei</p>
<p>7-5   6-4</p>
<p>Wen Sui   A Long</p>
<p>Regarding the second act of the competition, according to He Jia, the schedule will be decided after Du Bei (ranked sixth in France) arrives and the draw is redone. It seems Hong Kong still has a better chance of winning, as Du Bei is certainly better than Wen Sui. However, French tennis players may not be skilled on grass, and Xu Weipei will participate in the second singles match on grass at the Cricket Club, where he has a chance to defeat Wen Sui.</p>

<h3>Table Tennis Tournament Lacks Venues: Appeal for Local Table Tennis Rooms</h3>
<p>The fourth annual table tennis league, organized by the Shanghai Sports Association Table Tennis Committee, is scheduled to commence on April 11. The league handbook, which includes the names of all 55 team members, the league regulations, and the addresses of the venues, is being printed and will be distributed to each team before the start of the competition for reference. The schedule for the first week is being arranged. According to Secretary-General Chen Linsheng, although there are eight venues, only the Jingwu Athletic Association and the Postal Workers' Union have agreed to host matches four evenings a week. The remaining six venues, including Silk Industry, Hualian, Shanbao, Xinyi, Yousi, and Guohuo, can only be used when their respective teams are playing. Therefore, due to the lack of venues, scheduling is very difficult and affects the progress of the competition. The organizers earnestly appeal to any organizations or individuals with table tennis rooms who are not participating in this year's league to provide assistance. Any number of times per week that a room can be borrowed would be welcome. Those who wish to support the event should contact Chen Linsheng at Hualian Tongle Club, 194 Nanjing East Road, or call Mr. Chen at 16129 in the afternoons.</p>
<h3>St. John's University Track and Field Meet Opens: 400m and Javelin Results Best; Women's Softball Throw to Be Highly Competitive Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The two-day St. John's University Spring Track and Field Meet opened yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the university's athletic field in Fanhuangdu. Among the nine finals on the first day, the 400-meter race was the most exciting. Soccer star Jiang Weiliang burst out of his lane like a rocket, taking the lead after the first turn and running straight for the finish line. Individually, the redhead Lgoe Lee continued the dominance of the already-gone-to-America triathlon champion Balisi in track and field, winning first place in the 110-meter hurdles and third in the 100-meter race, scoring a total of 17 points and virtually guaranteeing first place in the individual standings. Jiang Weiliang is second with 13 points, and Pan Yongyi is third with 10 points.</p>
<p>Yesterday's 100-meter, 200-meter, and 400-meter races were changed to finals due to the number of participants, so the schedule for today has been slightly modified, starting at 3:00 PM:</p>
<p>(1) Women's 60-meter final, Men's discus final; (2) Men's 1500-meter final, Women's shot put final; (3) Women's 100-meter final, Women's softball throw final; (4) Men's long jump final, Women's javelin final; (5) Men's high jump final, Women's discus final; (6) Men's pole vault final, Women's long jump final; (7) Women's 200-meter final, Women's high jump final; (8) Men's 400-meter hurdles final; (11) Men's 5000-meter final; (12) Men's 1600-meter relay.</p>
<p>The women's softball throw will be highly competitive today. St. John's University has always been known as a softball incubator.

<h3>Group A Basketball League: Old Foreigners Clash Tonight</h3>
<p>Two exciting Group A basketball league games will be held today. Encars will face Haiqing at 6:00 PM at the YMCA gymnasium on Nanjing West Road, refereed by Liu Hesheng and Tao Bolinji. Encars's performance in the league has not been ideal, but their play has been excellent. Rookie Bo Tou is especially dangerous. Moreover, the YMCA gymnasium is Encars's home court, and they are very familiar with it, so victory is within their grasp. Haiqing is the Charlton Fleet, one of the weaker teams in the US Navy. Tonight, they face the experienced and battle-hardened Encars, so their chances are slim.</p>
<h3>Group B Schedule: Three Matches</h3>
<p>In addition to the Group A match between Encars and Haiqing at the YMCA, three Group B matches will be held at the gymnasium starting at 5:30 PM today. Ticket prices remain the same. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Tielian vs. Ping Ping (Group B C) 5:30 PM  Youyi vs. Xiqing Blue (Group B A) 6:30 PM  Jingji vs. Huanan (Group B B) 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>Samsung's Strong Lineup Defeats Pan Team by Half a Dozen Goals: Tomorrow Afternoon, Title Contenders Zhongyi Face Longtou</h3>
<p>Samsung Football Team was at full strength yesterday, defeating Pan Team 6-1 in the Democracy Cup. Every Samsung player worked hard and performed well. If they continue to field this strong lineup, they have a great chance of winning the Democracy Cup. Although Pan Team lost by six goals, the actual game was not one-sided. Their overall performance was respectable, especially Qian Ming and Sun Yongda, who had many beautiful moments. Only goalkeeper Song Boshou was slightly careless yesterday. The halftime score was 3-0, with Zhai Xigen scoring the first goal, followed by Zhang Jie and Lu Qingxiang. After the break, Fei Chunlin made it 4-0. Pan Team's forwards attacked strongly, creating dangerous situations in front of the Samsung goal, and Ha Zengguang eventually scored a goal. Afterwards, Lu Qingxiang displayed his power, scoring two more goals and increasing the lead to 6-1, which remained the final score. The entire match was clear and smooth, and both sides left happy.</p>
<p>Tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 PM, Zhongyi will face Longtou. Referee: Wang Lin; Linesmen: Wen Bin and Ma Youyu. Ticket prices have been adjusted to 2,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Table Tennis Tips</h3>
<p>— By Chen Linsheng</p>
<p>(5) Grip and Arm Movement</p>
<p>Let's first study the grip. There are many ways to grip the racket, broadly divided into two types: One is the reverse grip, where the wrist and racket are curved into a sickle shape, similar to holding a pen. The other is the horizontal grip, where the wrist and racket are in a straight line, maintaining a horizontal position.</p>
<p>In the horizontal grip, the handle and face of the racket are entirely controlled by the thumb. Sometimes, by bending the index finger joint and using the thumb to twist the racket, it can be converted into a reverse grip. However, once the grip is relaxed, it returns to the horizontal grip.</p>
<p>Of these two grips, the reverse grip is more convenient to use, while twisting the wrist with the horizontal grip is very unnatural. Therefore, fewer people adopt the horizontal grip.</p>
<p>This is a general overview. To accurately identify each person's grip, it can be said that everyone has their own unique style. I don't want to record all kinds of grips here, wasting space, but I want to present three very important points for everyone's reference:</p>
<p>1.  The grip should consider ease of use. Ease of use is certainly related to one's own habits, but in reality, one may not subjectively feel inconvenience, while it does hinder the development of skills. I once saw someone's grip where their hand was firmly gripping the hitting area, with the index finger lying on the edge of the racket, and the thumb and the other three fingers tightly pinching both sides. Objectively, this grip is less convenient to use.</p>
<p>2.  The grip should consider the full exertion of force. Hitting the ball doesn't necessarily require using full force with every shot. But, regardless of how we grip the racket, we must be able to use full force. Some people only use the thumb and part of the index finger to hold the racket. How much force can they possibly generate? This should be noted.</p>
<p>3.  Finger strength adjustment. When hitting the ball, the racket does not need to be gripped tightly from beginning to end. There should be an alternation between using force and not using force between shots and between stops. Only tightly grip at the moment of impact, when discerning the trajectory, aiming accurately, and hitting the ball. Otherwise, the fingers will easily become fatigued.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of arm movement is using the entire arm. Using the entire arm has two obvious benefits:</p>
<p>1.  More power. By using the entire arm, the range of motion is greater, the preparatory stance is more complete, and the force used when hitting the ball is naturally greater.</p>
<p>2.  Conserving energy. By using the entire arm, a larger range can be covered, the body moves more naturally, and the standing position is more stable. This avoids unnecessary running around, which are all obvious facts that prevent wasting energy. Conserving energy allows for longer practice. Furthermore, for natural movement, progress will definitely be faster. If the movement is limited to the wrist, it should be corrected immediately.</p>

<h3>This Year's "Wang Si Restaurant"</h3>
<p>— Qian Taicheng</p>
<p>The "Wang Si Restaurant" at the entrance of Xingfu Temple in Changshu can truly be said to be famous throughout Jiangnan. Yi Junzu wrote poems about it, and Feng Zikai painted it. "Yellow chicken and white wine, watching the mountains and fields." Local regulars and tourists from afar all say: "Although the price is a bit high, it's truly delicious." Thus, the square in front of it is always crowded with cars, chartered vehicles, rickshaws, and bicycles on beautiful spring and autumn days. The "Yushan Restaurant," directly across from it, also has osmanthus white wine and oiled chicken on bamboo mats, but its business is not as good. Sometimes, when the "Wang Si Restaurant" is too crowded, the "Yushan Restaurant" gets some of the overflow. Therefore, some say: The "Wang Si Restaurant" is the best at making money in Changshu, especially at making money from outsiders. "Shanjingjian" and "Ma Yongzhai" are far behind.</p>
<p>How is "Wang Si Restaurant" this year? The wine flag is still raised, and the verdant Yushan Mountain still surrounds it. However, there are no cars in front of it, and only a few rickshaws. The sounds of guessing games and drinking orders are nowhere to be heard, and you can't see anyone helping a drunk person home. There are a few farmers drinking white wine downstairs, and few diners upstairs. Some say: "The feng shui of Wang Si Restaurant has changed! They will lose money this year!" Others say: "The security situation has been uncertain recently, so people from Shanghai are afraid to come." Actually, that may not be the case. Even during the period of occupation, when the Japanese were overbearing and imposing their will, implementing martial law one moment and checking "good citizen certificates" the next, the "Wang Si Restaurant" was still always full. People in Jiangnan generally don't care much about security. What really worries them is money. In recent years, everyone's money has changed from legal tender to "puppet currency," from "puppet currency" to legal tender, from legal tender to "Gold Yuan notes," and now the Gold Yuan notes are changing again. There are some who have profited from these changes, but most people have lost everything. Yellow chicken and white wine are naturally out of reach. Wang Si Restaurant thrived on the small bourgeoisie, and naturally it will decline along with them. In the early years of the Republic of China, Wang Si Restaurant was a village farmers' tavern. At that time, we could see farmers squatting barefoot, drinking and singing loudly as the sun set. Later, Wang Si Restaurant changed from a village farmers' tavern to a small bourgeoisie tavern, and finally became a tavern for bureaucrats, wealthy merchants. Perhaps the future Wang Si Restaurant will return to its roots? Returning to its roots is returning to truth and simplicity. When that time comes, we will see families helping drunk people home after the farmers have worked hard and the new harvest has been brought in. If Wang Si Restaurant continues to try to do business with people from Shanghai, it will surely decline.</p>
<h3>Old Heads and New Heads</h3>
<p>— Wu Bao'an</p>
<p>Currently, the "Big Ocean" sound is making a commotion. Whether in speech, on the streets, in the markets, or in the newspapers, these four words are everywhere. I don't know who first came up with distinguishing silver dollars by the size of their "heads," but we know that distinguishing silver dollars by different "heads" has happened before, but it was the distinction between "new heads" and "old heads."</p>
<p>Long ago, at the beginning of trade between Guangzhou and foreign countries during the late Qing Dynasty, the first foreign currency to flow in were Spanish silver dollars with the portrait of King Carlos III (who ascended the throne in 1759). Mexican pesos and so on came much later. These silver dollars were more convenient than the silver ingots and taels then in circulation, as they were easy to hide and reliable, so they were very popular.</p>
<p>After Carlos III died, these silver dollars were no longer minted. Later, silver dollars of Carlos IV flowed in. However, because people were already accustomed to and had a deeper impression of the old silver dollars, their value was different from the newly arrived ones. Therefore, the silver dollars of Carlos III were more expensive than those of Carlos IV.</p>
<p>Because Chinese people didn't understand the strange Spanish, they called the former "old heads" and the latter "new heads."</p>
<h3>Change and No Change</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>The workers in this area are asking the boss to issue "Cost of living adjustments."</p>
<p>The old manager said, let all the shareholders consider it. The result of the consideration is: "This factory has decided to respond to all changes with no change. The request for the issuance of a cost of living adjustment should not be discussed."</p>
<h3>Triple Crown</h3>
<p>— Huiling</p>
<h3>"Music in the Office"</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>Recently, a kind of clinking music has become prevalent in the offices of organizations large and small.</p>
<p>This music begins in the middle and at the end of the month, and then gradually fades away. When this strange music can still be heard, everyone generally has a smile on their face; conversely, everyone is silent and looks worried. The influence of music is profound!</p>
<p>This tune is extremely natural, pleasant to the ear, and sonorous. Everyone is happy to appreciate it and happy to listen to it. Some feel that its sound is sonorous, like playing a flute; some feel that its sound is like weeping and complaining, like a sad elegy, beat by beat, hitting the depths of everyone's heart. In short, this sound is too touching, enough to make people smile knowingly, and enough to make people burst into tears.</p>
<p>In ancient terms, this would be "heavenly music"; in new terms, this would be authentic "people's music," most likely to arouse people's heartfelt resonance. It is not art, nor is it any carefully crafted masterpiece of a "fantasy," but it often evokes different "fantasies" in each person. This fantasy is sometimes beautiful, bringing comfort to those who are suffering and depressed, and making those who have given up hope smile through their tears. They fantasize about "tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, rising, rising..."</p>
<p>Music in the office – a fantasy of real life.</p>
