<h3>傳共方定月中　宣布和談代表</h3>
<p>毛澤東函措詞極禮貌</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京二日電〕可靠方面稱：中共主席毛澤東曾通知李代總統，謂將於十五日或十五日前後宣布中共和談代表，幷謂，和談地點在北平或石家莊。傳此說係在上海和平代表國携來之毛氏函內，但未說明何時開始和談。可靠方面幷謂，該函措詞極有禮貌。</p>
<h3>重要會談繼續進行　研討克服和談之困難點　並普遍交換對革新意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕李代總統召集之重要會商，因程　二日趕到，下午七時起復在傅厚崗官邸繼續舉行。至此，李代總統所邀約參與會商之要員，均已到齊，預料二三日內將可獲得重要決定，而爲未來局勢打開新局面。商談之詳細內容如何，參與者均拒絕透露，惟稱，所談者均與當前大局及對中共和談有關。據悉：二日下午七時會商時除就對中共和談及政治革新等問題普遍交換意見外，對於和談中可能遭遇之困難應如何克服問題，研討尤詳，參加者計有程潛，孫科，張羣，何應欽，張治中，白祟禧，邵力子，吳鐵城，翁文灝，吳忠信，實冠賢，于右任，居正，徐永昌，顧祝同等多人，迄十時許始散。又悉：李代總統定三日晚邀在京軍政要員共卅餘人。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江二日電〕蘇主席丁治磐二日奉李代總統電召，定三日晨尃車赴京，出席國是會議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕李代總統二日晚六時親赴首都飯店訪程潛，談約十分鐘返回官邸。又白崇禧晚六時半亦訪程氏。</p>
<h3>程潛由湘飛抵京</h3>
<p>〔太報南京二日電〕長沙綏靖公署主任兼湘主席程潛，應李代總統電邀，二日下午五時一刻乘迎接專機「追雲」號自衡陽飛抵京，同來者有唐縱，唐鴻烈等數人。李代總統私人代表李宇淸，何應欽代表劉士毅，白崇禧，顧祝同，賀耀組，邱昌謂，黃雪邨，程思遠，范予遂，張耀明，滕傑，張鎭，韋永成及湘籍立·監委，國代等數十人均在機塲歡迎。程氏下機後，與歡迎者一一握手，並應記者請，在機塲休息室發表談話。首謂：和平爲全國人民所希望，湖南爲全國之一部份，當然希望和平能以實現。記者詢以目前是否爲和談之時機時，程氏未加任何考慮，答稱：現正是很好的談和時候，惟談及中共之八條件時，程氏則避免批評。據程氏稱：湖南現甚安定，湖西近日來偶有小股土匪滋擾，惟此均係地方土匪，並非共黨。程氏否認湘省曾發行省幣之說，謂此來亦未携任何建議及改革方案。談及團結問題時，程氏謂，早應該團結一致。最後程氏稱，渠上次來京以後，今已相隔甚久，時勢變化，現局勢較之上次來時已好得多矣。談話畢程氏卽赴首都飯店休息。</p>
<p>上海和平代表團全體在北平六國飯店合影，前排中坐者爲四老，右爲黃啓漢左爲傳　蒼。</p>
<h3>政府局部改組即可見諸事實</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府局部改組，卽可見諸事實，因目前政院所屬部會中敎育，司法行政及衛生三部無部長，農林，社會，交通三部長堅辭。尚有辭職或不能視事之政委如張羣，張治中，林可璣等，故改組乃事實上之必要。又聞新任遞補人選，可能以桂系人物佔多數，顧孟餘亦爲其邀請之一，黃紹竑可能出任社會部長，靑年黨之部長政委左舜生，林可璣前已請辭，目前尚未作最後決定，左氏則定三日赴京有所洽晤。</p>
<h3>孫院長今邀宴在京全體立委</h3>
<p>李代總統定後日招待</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕立法院定四日舉行院會，立委盧郁文等卅餘人擬提出動議改開全院委員談話會，討論和平問題。行政院長孫科定三日午邀宴到京全體立委，李代總統則定五日下午三時舉行茶會，招待在京立委，均將交換有關時局意見。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州二日電〕立院副院長劉健羣，二日舉行茶會，招待在穗立委，聲明渠因職責所在，故定日內飛京一行。在穗立委仍堅主不去。</p>
<h3>孫科今對記者說明當前局勢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕行政院長孫科，定三日上午十時半招待記者，就當前局勢有所說明，並答覆詢問。又白崇禧二日上午十一時半謁孫科談數十分鐘辭出。又鍾天心，黃珍吾等二日上午亦往謁孫氏。</p>
<h3>顏惠慶在機塲告吳市長　與他談上海問題　章士釗杜月笙亦有交談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕顏惠慶·章士釗·江庸昨午飛抵龍華機塲時，吳市長亦曾往迎，顏氏下機後，旋向吳市長謂：「我有上海和你的問題同你談」市長笑問：「我有什麽問題？上海怎麼樣」？顏氏答以「這是你的事」。吳氏再詢以「有具體辦法沒有」？顏氏稱：「很好」，至十二時二十分，卽各登車返寓邸。旋吳市長於午後三時，驅車訪顏惠慶長談，歷半小時始出，滬江大學凌憲揚亦相繼訪候。另一和平代表章士釗曾訪杜月笙交換意見，一般推測所談之題材，自以上海之未來爲中心。</p>
<h3>顏章江三老抵滬　謂敲門任務已告完成但不管和談條件　張羣於右任曾與四氏長談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕顏惠慶章士釗江庸三和平老人等一行，二日午自京飛返滬。負推門之責之使者團，今終達成推門吿成之任務，昨至龍華機塲往迎者，有李代總統代表吳國楨市長，議長潘公展，谷春帆及顏·江·章等家屬顏惠慶出機後，對記者稱：「如雙方能開誠布公，一定可以談的，古語云：「已所不欲勿施於人。」本此原則，誠意相對，一定可以成功。顏氏對北平之行，顯感滿意，惟仍强調「困難還多，希望很大」，有詢以關於中共對懲辦戰犯之態度等，顏氏稱：「我們不管這些條件，我們的任務是敲門，現在已達成任務，把門打開了，就等雙方進行和談，詢以顏氏是否將再赴京或平，顏氏答：「否。以後是政府的事了」顏氏並稱人民希望和平，我舞就把人民的意見轉達到中共，中共也很瞭解，有詢以中共對和平之意見是否一致時，顏氏稱：「我不知道。在北平，中共的要人都已見到，他們的意見，我們亦已全部聽到，現在我們把這情形已轉報吿了政府」，其餘在平各節，顏氏等均未肯有所透露。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕顏江章三民二日晨由京返滬，邵力子未同行。張羣二日晨訪和平代表團四氏，交換和平問題意見，長談將近兩小時，此外于右任，甘介侯，成舍我，程滄波等，亦曾往訪。談畢，顏等卽赴機塲。章士釗登機前對邵所稱：「一切請你偏勞」，證實該團與政府間之繼續接洽將由邵負責。顏惠慶臨行時亦頻頻對邵力子稱：「一切偏勞了，拜托！拜托！」顏並答記者稱「我們須慢慢兒的向和平之路走去。政府如需我們來京時，仍隨時可來。」據稱此次顏，江，章，邵四氏返京後，對共方談話內容除向李代總統報吿外，政府要員能獲知者，不過二三人。故外間所傳該團携回共方條件，如、。戰犯問題可讓步而改編軍隊必須堅持等等，大都多屬揣測之詞，而事實上共方亦不致向和平使團提出具體條件也。至其最大收穫爲溝通南北雙方對和平之意見·今後談判時，雙方代表人數相同，共方代表已擬定，政府方面之代表亦正研商中黃紹竑仍在堅辭，且已由京赴港政府將另覓適宜人選遞補，其他三氏可能不予變動。</p>
<h3>民意代表亦可列席</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據接近上海和平代表團人士透露：中共同意在未來和談中，除政府正式代表外，民意代表亦可列席。甘介侯氏爲此將於一二日內來滬，與本市各界人土洽商此事。又顏惠慶氏定二三日內舉行記者招待會，報吿北行經過。</p>
<h3>中共注視台灣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中共電台廣播新聞節目中，對台灣問題近日曾一再提及，足以顯示其注視之動向。昨日廣播稿中，又宣布留平台胞二月廿八日在平舉行「二·二八」革命二週年紀念大會，中共平市宣傳部長趙毅敏及陳其瑗，章乃器。田漢·安娥等均出席，大會通過。向毛·朱致敬，並發表吿全國同胞書，謂國民黨正與美帝國主義訂立密約，企圖將台灣出賣與美國，變台灣爲美國之殖民地，「我人欲粉碎國民黨反動派之最後堡壘的反動統治，袛有在中共領導下，合灣始能得到解放，台湾人民始能獲得眞正之民主自由」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社香港一日電〕「臺湾解放同盟」今日發表文吿，再度籲請台人團結一致，建立「一個民主台灣共和國」。該同盟發言人稱：聯合國大會四月間開會時，該同盟将派代表赴成功湖提出台灣獨立問題，國民政府方面人士稱：該同盟僅代表「極少數前與日本合作之分子。」然消息靈通之觀察家，相信其基礎當較此更爲廣泛。最近麥克阿瑟將軍宣佈謂合灣仍附屬於盟軍最高統帥部，僅在對日和約簽訂以前由中國「佔領」而已一節，對於該同盟之活動，有刺激性之效果，中立人士對於該同盟若干分子最近訪日之行，甚予重視。</p>
<h3>經合總署將向美國會　提出援華新立法　估計每月需二千萬美元</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓一日電〕經濟合作總署中國分署長賴樸翰，一日下午招待記者宣稱：經合總署「不久」將向國會提出經濟援華之新立法，但該總署對於所需之基金，尚未提出任何請求，亦未作成任何估計。</p>
<p>賴樸翰稱：經合總署目前對該署正在執行工作之非共黨佔領之援助計劃，每月需款約二千萬美元，但渠否認外間所傳渠已吿監察委員會稱經合總署继續援華每年需二億四千萬美元，渠解釋此僅爲徇該委員會各會員之請，而根據目前之程度加以估計。渠又稱：「如渠政策規定不在共軍佔領區繼續工作，則吾人無需二億四千萬美元之多。」</p>
<p>渠谓，渠贊成對中國賡續作經濟援助，惟渠相信，目前「最聰明之作爲」，將爲延長立法權力，使現行計劃办理至本年六月底（目前按照國會之核准，此項計劃僅能辦理至四月三日）。</p>
<p>賴樸翰並謂，中國共產黨「至少暫時」似屬停留於上海以北之揚子江北岸，惟「彼等苟眞欲向前推進，則無法予以阻止」。渠稱：彼等苟眞正接管上海，「本人認爲吾人在該區之工作大致將予以停頓」。又謂，經合總署在上海所存之貨物，以原棉爲主，約可供六個星期之用。渠並估計，在共軍接收平津時，該兩地存有價值四百萬美元以上之經合署物資，其中計有價值三百五十萬美元以上之棉紡織品，其餘則係小麥與麵粉。</p>
<p>賴樸翰並稱：救助留美中國學生事，渠離華前已建議在經合署基金項下撥五十萬美元，專作此項用途。此項建議在原則上已得國務院之同意，經合署與國務院現正討論詳細之實施計劃。</p>
<h3>平新民報職工接辦</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕北平新民報已由職工接管，繼續出版，致電該報總管理處及其他各分社，申明脫離關係。內部人事，已大變動。</p>
<h3>國民黨全會期未定</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州二日電〕據國民黨中央黨部秘長鄭彥棻稱；（一）七中全會期仍未定，外傳三月廿九召開，不確。（二）中央黨部遷回南京問題，暫未予考慮。</p>
<h3>陳儀在浙東靜養</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕浙江省政府於上月下旬宣吿改組，消息傳來，若干人士均認爲意外迅速，且更對前浙主席陳儀之行踪，頗多推測及謠傳。頃據記者自可靠方面探悉，陳氏自卸任後，曾一度蒞滬小住後，健康情形仍欠佳，而訪者絡繹，更不勝其繁雜，遂於數日前被邀赴浙東某地靜養，陪與前往者尚有其部屬張延哲·錢宗起·周一鶴等數人。行踪甚秘密，短期內或不至外行。</p>

<p>〔中央社曲江二日電〕新任陸軍總司令張發奎將軍，二日在此接任視事。前總司令余漢謀親自移交。余氏定三日晨專車返穗。</p>

<h3>北平禁銀元流通</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中共電台廣播稱：北平中共軍管委會二月廿八日發出布吿，嚴禁銀元在市面流通及買賣，或貨物以銀元計價，並規定凡公私團體或個人所持銀元，應向人民銀行及所指定之兌換所按牌價兌換。又謂中國人民銀行津分行一日開始辦公，特增設實業·外匯·儲蓄·合作四部。</p>

<p>〔本報南京二日電〕頃據首都衛總發言人政工處長羅春波談稱：（甲）本月前本部確曾破獲首都陰謀暴動案，緣二月五日本部得密報，謂有中國革命委員會中央委員會兼南京分會主任委員孟士衡，於二月六日晚八時在南京大光路大光新村二號吳士文家，與共軍江淮軍區聯絡員舉行秘密會議，陰謀在首都暴動，本部乃將主持該案之重要人員，分別逮捕，並至上海將孟士衡捕獲，解京審訊。據供：所謀屬實；其辦法如下：（一）控制飛機塲，（二）切斷交通幹綫，（三）扣留李代總統及重要軍政首長，（四）成立南京人民解放委員會，（五）成立南京人民市政府，（六）接應共軍過江，一面利用各同鄉會聯誼會等方式，分別進行軍運·憲運·警運工作計劃，勾結五千人，以二千人在市內暴動，三千人接應共軍渡江，並派某人與共軍接洽內應。又詢審其他各犯，亦均承認參加是項組織不諱。如女國代夏琫瑛，卽係該會婦女委員會主任委員。</p>
<p>孟士衡係上海負責人</p>
<p>（乙）根據孟士衡之口供，獲悉上海亦有是項組織。蘇浙監察委負行署專員許志遠係上海組織中之重要負責人。本部乃派員赴滬，會同淞滬警備司令部將許逮捕解京，現正密訊中。（丙）本案係陰謀以軍事暴動顚覆政府之案件，並非政黨或政治犯問題。本部負衛戍首都之責，不能不採取緊急措施，逮捕必要人員，但行動時，極爲審愼，非該組織之重要人員，不願株連。外傳牽連七八十人之多，絕無其事。秦秀卿及其訪友，本部並未拘捕。（與本報前日所載，其經過與事實，頗有出入之處）。（丁）本案現正繼續偵訊中，一俟偵訊完畢，卽報請上峯核示；結案後，如認有必要時，再行公布。</p>
<p>秦秀卿業已恢復自由</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕孟士衡之夫人秦秀卿，二日午後至本報南京辦事處購本報一份，據談：渠僅一度被看管，但不數日卽恢復自由。惟據衛總羅處長稱：並未將伊拘捕。</p>
<p>鎮江陶鴻釗亦已被捕</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江二日電〕前因貪汚案被撤職看管之鎭江城防司令陶鴻釗少將，亦與顚覆政府大陰謀案有關。聞渠曾暗中與蘇北共軍聯緊，圖於共軍發動渡江攻勢時，利用其職權，先行拘扣蘇省黨政首長，使地方秩序陷入混亂狀態，並切斷京滬交通，俾首都大暴動一舉成功，詎以事機不密，致遭逮捕，且影響其全部計劃之進行。</p>

<h3>東南亞聯盟的醞釀</h3>
<p>東南亞洲的危機，日益深刻，幾乎沒有一國不在動亂之中。印尼問題迄未解決，而新生不久的緬甸獨立國，又於最近發生喀倫族的叛雙，刻正以武力進攻緬甸第二大都市瓦城，緬甸中央政府若不能獲得切實有效的外援，則頗難控制全國局勢。同時，暹羅首都也發生所謂「反動份子的叛亂」，曾使曼谷的對外交通全部中斷。從這種情勢的歸趨看來，可知東南亞洲的局勢，每况愈下，如果沒有挽回的方法，或將演變到不可收拾的地步。印度總理尼赫魯有鑒於此，乃於上月廿八日召開東南亞英國自治領會議，共商緬甸問題，欲從解決緬甸問題下手，進而謀整個東南亞的安定。所以，亦新德里舉行的英國自治領會議，不僅要澈底解決緬甸的內部問題，謀得緬甸政治經濟的安定：而且還要進一步，採取具體有效的辦法，例如組織東南亞反共聯盟等，用以自保自衛，低抗外來的侵略，謀得整憫東南亞的安定。</p>
<p>這次英國自治領會　，除了英國代表東南亞高級專員麥唐納與海外貿易部大臣博騰萊出席而外，尚有印度，錫蘭，巴基斯坦，澳洲，紐西蘭等五個自治領的代表，由原發起人印度總理尼赫魯主持其事；至其主要議題，一是緬甸問題，二是東南亞組織反共聯盟問題。</p>
<p>關於緬甸問題，與會的代表對於新生的緬甸獨立之後不久即發生叛變，無不表示扼腕。惟因緬甸的安危，影響英國與印度的利益，至深且鉅，抑且對於東南亞也有重大關係，所以各自治領的代表特別提高緬甸問題對於東南亞的警覺，故一致主　，緬甸問題應即設法覓致和平解決的辦法。但究竟應該採取何種解決步驟！各代表的意見，却又不十分一致。有的主張緬甸應該取消獨立，重行投到英國懷抱裏去；澳洲外長伊瓦特曾公然指出緬甸與英帝國斷絕聯繫，實在是一種錯誤的舉動。但也有人認爲單靠經濟援助是不足以使緬甸恢復和平繁榮的，故主張用某種方式出面調處，辯論到最後，始採取溫和辦法，即以東南亞自治領會議的名義，致電緬甸總理泰金諾，提出尋求和平解決的建諸，並坦白表示：　對緬甸的經濟援助，將以緬甸政府與喀倫族獲致協議爲條件，這個決議，析裏至當，緬甸的內爭自當可望因此獲得和平解決，替安定東南亞增加一重因素。</p>
<p>至關於組織東南亞反共聯盟的問題，因爲內容複雜，自非可一蹴而成。但最堪注意的，就是東南亞各國感受共產黨勢力的威脅，已是彰明昭著的事實。自從中國共產黨得勢以來，亞洲共產勢力的南侵，日甚一日，是誰也不能否認的了。印尼·越南·馬萊亞·暹羅·緬甸，固不必說，就是菲律賓和印度，也已感受其威脅。最近印度總理尼赫魯向議會報吿，也曾嚴詞抨撃共產黨企圖在印度陰謀叛變，他說：「印度共產黨乘中國·馬來亞·緬甸共黨得勢之際，也想在印度破壞秩序，並欲武力推翻政府。幸賴政府採取斷然措置，共黨陰謀均未能得逞，在過去十日內，因有跡近公開叛亂之暴動而被捕者，已達八七〇人之多」。這是印度的實情，也就是東南亞各國動亂情形的寫眞。印度情形尚且如此，其他各國更不必說了。</p>
<p>由上所述，共黨勢力早已潛入東南亞各國，最近又因中國共黨軍事的得勢　益增其氣燄，有如燎原的野火·印度總理　赫魯發起　南亞自治領會議，表面上是爲了緬甸的內亂，實際上還不是爲了東南亞的反共聯盟？同時，漢洲外長伊瓦特爲了本身的安全感起見，也極力主張東南亞應該成立一個類似西歐聯盟的組織，以抵抗外來的侵略，據合衆社倫敦廿八日電稱，成立一個東南亞防禦計劃，是非常可能的，一是大家都相信印度一國已有成爲反共壁壘之實力；二是懊洲外長的當仁不讓，認爲英國旣忙於歐洲事務無暇東顧，澳洲自應出來領導各自治領，反共自衛。準此而論，這次東南亞英國自治領會議決定組織東南亞反共聯盟，當有十分之八九的可能。從前常說中國是東亞的安定力，舉世都應注意使中國這安定力不要搖動，所惜眼光短淺者太多，而今或要漸漸感覺野火也要燒過去了。我們爲東南亞的和平與繁榮計，固然也盼望東南亞各國即能成立這種自衛性質的聯盟，然而我們仍然要促起舉世各國的覺醒，中國一天不安定，中國一天受侵略，則東南亞也就一天不得安定，一天有被侵略的危險。我們遙望東南亞，更不能不反顧中國的大局究竟如何演變。</p>
<h3>核定收支穩定金融　進出口貿易更進一步改善　徐財長在滬闡明封財金新方案希望</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財長徐堪二日自京來滬，下午五時招待記者，徐氏稱：招待目的「在將此次頒布之財金改革方案之用意及將來的希望，對各位坦白的說明」。</p>
<p>徐氏首稱：新方案計分：（一）財政，（二）金融，（三）進出口貿易，（四）物資調節，（五）物資生產各部，（四）（五）兩部非財部主管，故僅對首三部加以解釋。略謂：第一部財政，主旨求收入與支出之核實，藉以减少收支之不平衡。改訂稅收辦法可舉而言者，首爲關稅改用關元繳付，採用關元繳納進口稅，並不减少金圓劵之用途，行使關元後，袛要長江航運維持暢通則估計關稅每年最少可收入美金三千萬元，此對平衡財政收支，助益彌大。貨物稅對棉紗·水泥·火柴·捲菸·食糖五種，均行征實，政府征實後，握有大量物資，可用以調節市塲供需。惟不至增加各廠負担。直接稅中之營利事業所得稅，現決採估價包繳制，以達征稅簡捷之原則。　稅方面，近因若千鹽商及運銷商資金不敷週轉，故決辦一部份食鹽之官收及官運。至於支出方面，亦求核實，現最大之支出卽爲軍費，因國家不勝負担，影響遂及風紀之敗壞，軍費提高後，士氣自可望振作。公敎人員因機關人數兩衆，國庫負祖甚重，故今後決儘量裁併駢枝機關，同時，設法提高公敎待遇，俾使安心工作。又中央爲使地方政府財源充裕起見，自卅八年十月一日起，田賦決劃歸地方。在不妨碍中央稅制之下，地方亦得自行酌定稅制</p>
<p>第二部金融方面，主要係開放金銀自由買賣，准許銀元流通。此舉並非恢復銀本位，而在尊重現實，便利人民。相信金銀自由買賣後，中央銀行卽可以更大之力量，以穩定市塲，，同時卽籌劃白銀，增鑄銀元。</p>
<p>第三部進出口貿易方面，自上年十一月政院公布新辦法後，已較前改善，現則更進一步。（一）出口商可自辦進口，不加限制。（二）輸入方面，除捲菸·石油·製品·糧食·棉花·肥料等六種，仍維持限額制外，餘均儘量放寬。（三）自備外匯之輸入，亦儘量放寬。又今後僑匯亦不致與牌價美金發生差額，僑匯當不致逃避。惟開放黃金·白銀，性質仍爲一種貨物之買賣，故金銀之進口，仍收進口稅。</p>
<p>徐氏結語有云：此次新方案決不唱高調，終望使目前財金情形，得到相當之穩定。然今日要求此案完全收效，主要仍須看和談是否能得到合理之結果，大局是否有一解決之辦法。新方案推行是否有效，此實爲主要之關鍵。關於新方案之實施細則，徐氏稱尚在擬訂中，日內卽可脫稿，待政院核定後公布施行。（請參閱第六版）</p>

<h3>靈甫號一艦員今爲百貨店員　滿腔悲憤揮淚話舊</h3>
<p>〔路透社本市訊〕與巡洋艦重慶號同時由英移贈中國之驅逐艦靈　號之某一艦員，向本社談及重慶號於兩天前失踪之事件時，認爲兩艦優秀海軍靑年在英受訓兩年與英國同伴享受同等優渥待遇後，歸來後待遇菲薄，造成空前的失望，實爲重慶號失踪之主因。當兩艦遠涉重洋自英駛抵上海後，兩艦之半數艦員卽請求上峯准其返鄕探親。提出此等請求者，大多數卽係表示其本人已具有不顧海軍當局指派兩艦之任務而欲脫離中國海軍之決心。兩艦人員離英返國之際，抱有滿腔熱望，但一抵國門，竟不啻迎頭被澆一桶冷水，當初抵　海之際，適值蔣經國氏嚴格執行限　政策之時，待遇問題第一使艦上靑　感覺不滿，在英受訓期間，彼等待　與英海軍人員等，旣抵上海，每人月餉僅得金圓十七元，彼等之技能及經騐竟被完全漠視。當兩艦一入中國領水，英國服裝及紙烟之配給立刻被取消，雖然艦上此等存貨猶極充足。該員又吿本社曰：「當余請求准許赴靑島探親時，竟不許余將英國製之羊毛襪及毛毯携赴岸上，但事後全竟在北京路上有公開發售此等毛襪毛毯者。」該員又曰：當兩艦抵新加坡及香港時，兩地華人熱烈歡迎，迨抵上海，中國海軍之惡劣傳統風氣立卽充分發揮其効力，使人感覺在英國之兩年訓練完全虛擲。該負最後以悲痛之語調吿本社稱：余在英國受訓兩年，專習管理軍艦鍋爐之技能，然而今日竟在一百貨店內担任出售領帶之工作，中國人才之出路竟至於此，可悲孰甚。按該員今已脫離海軍而自行就業矣</p>

<p>〔路透社法蘭克福二日電」美蘇兩強在德之緊張關係，因美軍政府於今晨在此間蘇聯遣僑團總辦事處前派駐武裝警衛，嚴禁尚入而達到嚴重的最高峯。蘇遺僑團人員實際上已陷於封鎖之中。美軍總督克萊以事態嚴重，已電華盛頓請示，以準備萬一。法蘭克福美軍司令伍特今晨曾晤見蘇遣僑團長，再提蘇遣僑團以任務完畢，必須退出美軍區之要求。蘇團長當塲拒絕此一要求，申明除非接奉莫斯科之撤退令，決不撤退。事後，美當局立卽派武裝警衛駐守該團總部前，禁止任何人出入。伍特繼又再向蘇團長建議，表示美方願意護送該團人員至蘇佔區邊界，蘇方再度加以拒絕後，克萊遂下令切斷該團之電流電話煤氣，該團因此乃完完全陷於孤立狀態。此訊傳出以後，法蘭克福街頭頓時聚集德人甚多，預料亂事之將發生。人羣中之親蘇份子躍躍欲試，隨時有發動事變之可能。美軍當局亦採取緊急戒備措施。按該團係根據波茨坦協定而設，以主持德境美區內蘇難民遣返本國之事宜。克萊於上週卽令該團結束，但被拒絕。昨夜莫斯科致牒美大使館抗議克萊之勒令出境事，申明此舉直接違悖波茨坦協定之規定。美軍司令伍特今晨且令蘇遺僑團卸下其辦事處前之蘇聯國旗，然至今午爲止，蘇旗飄飄如故。伍特向記者談及此事時。羅勃森（英）·寇尼許（法）·適齊在柏林，三人對於此事之發展，均予密切注意。羅美）·羅勃森（英）·寇尼許（法）·適齊在柏林，三人對於此事之發展，均予密切注意。羅勃森雖以此事乃美方之事件爲辭，拒不發表意見，但對克萊所持態度表示道義上的支援。寇尼許表示蘇聯如欲發動事端，殊非難事，蓋德人民中固不乏親蘇份子也。</p>
<h3>英首相明日訪德　逗留四日視察空運措施</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕此間今日正式宣布，英首相艾德禮定於本月四日至七日間訪問德國，以視察德境英當局之空運措施。英外部次官專負責德國事務之漢德森將隨行。艾德禮苜相在德期間將下楊於英軍總督羅勃森之官邸。　根據預定行程表，艾德禮首相於星期五午夜至星期日晨，將逗留柏林，星期日晨起將赴英區他處視察。按艾德禮上次柏林之行，係在一九四五年七月，當時係以反對黨領袖之身份，隨邱吉海出席波茨坦會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林二日電〕與蘇軍政府接近之德人透露，英相艾德禮定期訪德之消息，使蘇軍政府深感驚奇。蘇軍總督索柯落夫斯基之政治顧問謝曼諾夫大使得訊以後，立卽赴索帥在波茨坦之官邸密談甚久。</p>
<h3>蘇在奧匈羅境內　駐軍十萬人</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕據可靠報吿，蘇聯在奧·匈·及羅馬尼亞約有軍隊十萬人。傳此一報吿現在國務院高級會議之考慮中。</p>
<h3>克萊提出建議　恢復德造船業</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓一日電〕此間消息：英美不久卽將舉行談判，以決定是否准許德國建造航行海洋之般舶。德境美軍總督克萊最近曾建議恢復德國之造船業及商船隊。傳克萊特別主張准許德國建造一萬噸貨船若干艘及三萬五千噸郵船一艘。美海軍部贊成克萊之建議，惟其他方面則反對殊力。克萊之建議不啻將波茨坦協定禁止德國建造海洋船舶之規定擱置一隅，此間官方亦逐漸相信此項禁止規定，終必放寬，以准許德建造航行海岸及運河之船舶。</p>
<h3>蘇聯擬創立盧布貨幣區　大量存金爲担保品</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦一日電〕此間謠傳蘇聯政府擬使盧布具有國際價值，而將創立盧布貨幣區。在此區域內，匯兌完全自由。盧布兌換之價值，將以蘇聯三十年來所積儲之大批黃金爲祖保品。此項儲備金因蘇聯開發金鑛之結果，日見增多，其數共達美金三十億元，有謂六十億元，一百偉元，甚至更巨於此者。按美國金準備除蘇聯外，佔世界總數百分之八十五，其數約二百二十億元，而金鎊區中僅有二十億元。</p>

<h3>馬錫爾恢復現役已獲杜魯門核准</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓一日電〕美陸軍部宣布前國務卿馬歇爾呈請恢復現役，已由杜魯門批准。按馬歇爾於一九四七年就國務卿　數時，曾列入退役軍官名册中，按照政府創置「五屋上將」之條例，凡受此特榮者，不受其他軍官退役與年限條例之約束，而可終身領取官俸與津貼，並保留其職位。</p>
<h3>印喀邦公民投票史密斯任監督員</h3>
<p>〔路透肚成功湖一日電〕可靠方面息：美駐蘇大使史密斯，或將以私人資格，被任爲聯合國　什米爾公民投票之監督員。史氏最近已向杜魯門請辭駐蘇大使職，惟官方尚未宣在。</p>
<h3>北大西洋安全公約草案　七國談判順利進展　邀義參加各方多表反對</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓二日廣播：國務卿艾契遜頃在記者招待會中聲稱，準備參加北大西洋公約各國，現正討論是否邀請義大利及其他國家加入。艾氏並表示渠希望此事能早獲決定。目前正在討論該公約之國家，已有美加及西歐聯盟五國。傳七國一日會商中，似有將地中海國家排除於該公約之外之傾向。</p>
<p>但艾氏稱，各國對該約文字並無重要之爭議，並謂會議正在和諧空氣中順利進行。艾氏並稱，政府擬以軍火接濟外國，並已由國務院開始草擬計劃，此項費用至少需款十五億元。該案俟參院討論北大西洋公約後卽可提出。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓一日電〕七國代表今日在美國務院內開會，擬具北大西洋公約最後草案，謠傳該約今夜卽可草成，惟尚不獲證實。</p>
<h3>公約增添條款防共勢力滲入</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓一日電〕此間權威方面息：北大西洋公約，除將規定對西歐國家供給援助，以抵抗外來的任何侵略外，並將規定供給西歐國家以援助以抵抗內來的侵略。就此以觀，北大西洋公約，不啻係以西半球之聯防及互助公約爲藍本。西半球公約曾明文規定，根據本約設立之諮議機構，於發生危險的威脅時，得考慮適當的集體措施，而在北大西洋公約亦已包括此項條款。據悉，起草該約立法案之官員，已覺美國不但應供給西歐以抵抗武裝攻擊所必需的物資，且應協助西歐抵抗共產勢力的滲入。當杜魯門首次發起援助希土計劃時，固已確立此項原則。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓二日廣播。美陸軍當局透露，駐日美軍總數不但朱見减少，且將增加一萬二千人。據該發言人稱，自一九五〇年會計年度（按自本年七月一日始）起，駐日美軍總額可達九萬五千人至十萬人之間，而九四八年年底時僅約七萬五千人至八萬人左右·最近軍部招待記者時曾宣布，遠東美軍當局曾要求將駐軍增至十二萬七千人。該軍部發言人並稱：美國防部已將下年度遠東駐軍駐防地區吿知英自治領各國，麥帥旣有四個完整的戰門師，足證前傳駐日美軍將予縮减一说之无稽。</p>
<h3>移民法种族限制美衆院决议取消</h3>

<p>（聯合社海牙一日電〕荷蘭發言人今日暗示，荷蘭或將脫離西歐五國經濟同盟。據稱：印尼問霆之解決與荷蘭參加西歐同盟一事相連繫。荷蘭對印尼成立協定之成敗，將決定其是否爲西歐同盟中一重要份子。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞二日電〕聯合國調解會今日向安理會提出報吿，謂荷蘭政府提議在海牙召開印荷圓卓會議，仍自作主張，漢視安理會一月廿八日之決議。安理會決議要求釋放印尼共和國領袖，恢復印尼共和國，監督印尼聯邦議會之選舉及在一九五〇年七月一日以前以全部主權移前印尼聯邦。荷蘭迄未加以接受。報吿書又稱，各方對於設立聯邦臨時政府尚未成立協議。印荷雙方並未遵照安理會決議進行談判。安理會下令停戰兩月赤，印尼境內戰事未嘗停止，且在擴大中。印尼政治僵局之根本因素，在於荷蘭政府不使印尼共和國政府在日惹恢復行使職權。</p>
<h3>美國防部長與陸長　傳將於五月退休　伏希斯負責管理佔領事務</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕此間預料在此後數月內，繼續有閣員調動事宜，尤以國防部爲甚。國防部長福萊斯特及陸長羅雅爾之任期久暫，在被揣測之列。福氏最近在全國報界俱樂部宴席上曾謂：「當余認爲余在此一程序中（統一三軍計劃）無甚用處時，余擬辭退。」據暗示，五月一日爲福氏可能退休之日</p>

<h3>麥帥告英報記者　蘇如攻日美決助日　但不相信蘇有力量侵佔日本</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京一日電〕麥帥一日吿倫敦每日郵報記者勃雷士稱：如蘇聯攻擊日本，則「我們決應保衛牠。」但渠繼稱：渠不相信蘇聯將攻擊日本。在麥帥總部的會見中，渠方坦白討論日本在太平洋英美戰略中所佔之地位。渠稱：如有另一大戰，「我們不希望日本作戰。」麥帥解釋稱：「日本的地位爲太平洋中之瑞士。」記者問：「假使日本被攻擊則如何？」麥帥稱：「果爾，則我們決將保衛她。」但渠繼稱：「我不相信蘇聯將攻擊日本。卽使蘇聯政府有侵略日本之信念，她亦不能實現，除非她能有制空權，並有蘇聯本國的遠東艦隊或有方法消滅美艦隊之任何行動。」渠稱：「蘇聯不能獲得制空權。戰爭結束時，美國在冲繩島建有機塲二十五處，每日可派出最大之B29型轟炸機三千五百次，整個東亞，自新嘉坡至海參威，全在此稱飛機炸程之內。問及日本在防衛戰略中之功用時，麥帥答稱：「我們向來將日本視爲盟國。我們希望其保持中立，我們助其自給自足，使我們减去供應她的負担。我相信在三四年內日本可在食糧方面以國內出產而自足，或以出口交換進口食糧。」</p>
<p>美國戰略　全爲戰爭改變</p>
<p>雖然共黨最近在中國勝利，麥帥相信英美在太平洋之利益完全平安，並不以日共在普選有所收　而担心。渠稱：渠不認爲日共與莫斯科有何聯繫。但稱：美國戰略已完全爲戰爭所改變。「我們防衛準備乃根據在大陸上，認爲太平洋乃可能敵人進攻之道路。現在太平洋已成爲盎格魯湖，我們之路綫爲通過一串島嶼直至亞洲海岸，該綫自菲律賓起，經過琉球羣島，包括主要堡壘冲繩島在內，又經日本及阿留申羣島至阿拉斯加。雖然共軍在華之勝利，使彼等在該位置之側面，但並未改變此事實，卽我們亞洲大陸上的可能敵人，並未有鄰近的工業基地以補給水隨陸兩棲的攻擊軍。」麥帥稱：「蘇聯之戰爭工業乃在烏拉山地區，彼等大量出產之武器及軍火，須靠長四千哩之鐵路綫始能運至海參威。」</p>
<p>日國防軍　建立尚非其時</p>
<p>問及關於日本應「准許」成立國防軍之建議時，麥帥答稱：「此乃過早之建議，此爲草擬對日和約時始能決定之問題，在和約簽訂前，佔領軍仍將留日，此並非壓制日本－此乃不必要者－乃因戰時爲盟國各强權間之不幸分裂，使我們爲防衛英美利益而應予佔領之前哨。」麥帥稱：如日本被攻，則招募軍隊「與我們合作」事極極易。渠指「日人爲世界上最頑固之步兵」。記者提及蘇聯曾稱日本警察乃未來陸軍之核心時，麥帥不以此爲然。渠稱：「現有十二萬五千元，彼等任務乃維持國內秩序，其中持有手槍者不足百分之二十。」</p>
<p>最近雖然共黨在日議會四六六之席次中自四席增至三十五席，但麥帥不相信共產主義對日本是一危險，渠稱：「此種比例成許表現彼等之實際力量，我不相信日本共黨與莫斯科有直接關係，共產主義在此百分之四十八爲小農之國家中，將不致擴展，使地主田地移交與佃農之土地改革，使更多人民在國內有利害關係。我不認爲共產主義在日本此在英國或美國更可怕。麥帥相信日人對新的社會觀念及盟軍佔領所給予彼等更大之自由，深爲感激。渠稱：「日本工人曾被殘忍剝削，工資之低，僅足糊品，我們已准日本工人成立工會，每日八小時之工作，集體爭議權，及其他利益。我完全盼望日本能有一工黨成立。」</p>
<p>麥帥印象　使人想起福熙</p>
<p>記者雖有訪問世界最奢名人物之經驗，但談話給人印象之深，很少如麥帥者。渠以非常流利及良好詞句，自上次在歐洲戰爭之戰略談至美政府對華政策。麥帥談話之流利，使記者想起福熙蔣軍，渠解說複雜問題之才能實令人羨慕。麥帥着美軍戰服，每一肩章上有五銀星圍成一圈。渠之辦公處，在有大理石柱支持建築物之頂層，以前爲一保險公司之辦事處，面對日本皇宮。如麥帥之父早生數月，則現年六十九之麥帥可要求爲英國國籍。渠稱：「我祖父爲住於格萊斯商之蘇格蘭人，渠在一八四二三十歲時赴美，我父不久卽出生，而我卽在麥克沃瑟族的傳統中長成。我未曾到過蘇格蘭，但如假期够長，我定將一行」。麥帥對英國及澳人表示最溫暖之情感，渠於戰時在澳洲任總司令。渠稱：「自首相至戰士，我不能有更忠誠的支持如彼等所給予我者。」麥帥最崇拜者爲邱吉爾，渠於戰時在澳任司令時，曾與邱氏通信，記者問：「蘇聯對在德之盟國佔領軍橫加干涉，閣下爲何對蘇聯無何麻煩？」麥帥答稱：「或許因爲蘇聯東方人的智力與成吉思汗時代相同，而我對處勝東方又已有多年之經驗。」</p>
<p>訪問記的發表又引起了口舌</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京二日電」麥帥總部新聞室發言人二日稱：麥帥並未授權「倫敦每日郵報」記者勃雷士根據渠等二人間的談話而發表訪問記。該發言人稱：麥帥從未給予聲明性的談話，並一向戒其僅作幕後參考，勿予發表·渠稱：勃　士如非誤解，卽係違背其信約。</p>
<p>但據勃雷士宣稱：渠與麥帥會晤前，麥帥及盟總人員從未吿渠此項會談不能發表。勃氏稱：渠曾特請麥帥總部之新聞部長愛各爾士上校設法，俾渠得與麥帥「會談」，其後遂達到會晤之目的，與麥帥在星期一會談約一小時。</p>

<h3>箱屍原車運滬北站萬人爭觀　車上怪客涉嫌在崑山遭扣押　屍送騐屍所地檢處今日檢騐</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕火車箱屍案，昨日經兩路局警務處努力偵査結果，已扣押嫌疑犯一名。緣前日下午隨七十四次車監視屍箱之便衣探警，在崑山站發現一可疑人物，經一度跟蹤秘密監視後，逕予扣押偵訊。箱屍於昨日上午十一時五十五分由原車從常州運返本市，送常德路騐屍所，地檢處定今晨十時派檢察官前往騐屍。警務當局希被害人家屬讀報後，早日發覺，來滬認領屍體，提供綫索，俾便偵査破案。</p>
<p>「箱屍」自前日下午三時四十分在京滬路第七十四次車上發現後，路局警務處隨卽動員全體便衣員警，在兩綫各站密佈偵緝綱。該兩皮箱仍原樣放置車上，由便探五名化裝旅客，暗中看守。七十四次車於同日下午四時卅分開車，晚九時晚抵常。車中旅客均不悉此兩皮箱中藏有異物，到達常州站後，亦無人取此兩箱。在常站留宿一宵，亦無甚動異，故昨晨六時該列車從常州返滬（第七十三次）時，「箱屍」仍原車帶回。惟隨車便探於七十四次車自化海北站開行時，卽已注意到」可疑人物，因屍箱係放於該車第二節三等客車上，而該車原係由四等車改裝，一切設備較爲簡陋，且接近機車，烟灰甚多，依通常情形，必待其後各節客車滿座後，始有人乘入此車，而當時有一男子，到月台後卽入坐於第二節車中，其時以後各車廂中旅客尚寥落無幾，且該男子在途中頻頻注視兩箱，並不時環顧四週旅客，行動舉止極不自然，車抵崑山卽行下車，便警二名當卽尾隨監視，迄晚因其嫌疑重大，遂予扣押偵訊。</p>
<h3>死者生前體格魁梧足踝留有繩索痕跡</h3>
<p>載有「箱屍」之七十三次車於昨日午刻由常州駛抵上北站，生辦該案之金所長命行李伕二名，搬箱至三四等候車室背後之空地上，細加研究，發現一箱上留有一角殘餘封條，有「×」字隠約可辨。箱內除用以覆蓋屍塊之棉花胎及白布外，尚發現破舊黑呢女大衣一件，黃色軍毯一條，報紙半張（可能爲杭州出版之東南日報）。由屍塊觀察，被害人生前必爲身强力壯，身體高大魁梧人物。頭顧左眼上有深大刀痕一處，足踝部尚有繩索捆綁痕跡。屍體支解後，必經細心洗刷楷抹，故屍塊淨潔異常。金所長以未經檢察官檢驗以前未便多加翻動，卽於午後二時一刻，仍用原箱原樣裝盛，用卡車送驗屍所。</p>
<p>北站交通阻塞</p>
<p>不料卡車開至北站大樓與廣塲相通之鐵門口，突擁到大批好奇市民，將卡車圍住，爭看「箱屍」，雖經護送路警苦勸亦無效，且越聚越多，數逾萬人，北站入口大門亦被人羣阻塞，汽車·三車均無法入站，一時秩序甚亂。據站上人員稱：昨日淸晨附近居民閱報得悉火車上發生此怪案後，卽三三兩兩來站探詢「箱屍」。午刻「箱屍」抵滬，因甚秘密，外間絕鮮得悉者，及裝上卡車擬送騐屍所時，始被人覺察。此種消息</p>

<p>傳播最速，頃刻之間引來如許觀衆，甚至阻塞北站交通達二十多分鐘，此當非警務當局始料所及</p>
<h3>問題一串耐人思索</h3>
<p>路警當局除全力偵緝兇犯外，另由偵探及犯罪學專家數人，根據現有證物推究全案情節。據悉，彼等從屍身及箱中黃軍毯推測，死者可能爲一軍人。至於「箱屍」從何站上車，何以必運往常州，運往常州是否爲烟幕，該携運「箱屍」來滬人物現匿何處，是否卽係兇犯，屍箱中之女大衣有何關係，屍箱上殘餘封條「×」字如何加以利用，……一速串問題，均極耐人尋味，凾待解答也。</p>

<h3>鞭砲鑼鼓交大熱鬧　學生自治會競選白熱化</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕徐家匯交通大學內，這幾天爲了復員後第七屆學生自治會的改選，給浸沉在猛烈的競選熱潮裏。這學期自治會由個入競選改爲班級競選，要從全校八十三班中選出十班來執行自治會的各部門工作，於是各班級間熱烈的展開了競選運動。一進校門，從敎室到飯廳到宿舍，觸眼所及，祗見大大小小花花綠綠的宣傳標語貼滿四壁，走道樹上張掛着大幅的競選布幟，廣播機裏傳送出競選的綱領，連地上亦給貼了一個個競選的美術字。各班競選宣傳的方法五花八門，各有不同。除了普遍的一套外，更有演電影，欣賞唱片音樂等娛人耳目的節目。各班競選經費來源各異，或由同學樂捐，或由系會捐助，或由該班同學平均分攤，其中以採取前二項辦法居多。</p>
<p>昨天中午十二時半，各班在校內聯合舉行了競選大遊行。大家勾心鬥角，各逞其能，行列裏有洋樂隊，大鑼大鼔，結綵汽車，化裝表演，各種各樣的宣傳橫匾和標語。鮮明的交通大學大旗帶領着這五六百人的隊伍走遍了校內各處，鑼鼓聲，鞕砲聲，歌聲，舞蹈，口號，交織成熱烈的塲面，各班都請同學投他們一票。校內敎授，工警和學生擁塞於走道二邊，當行列走過時，轟起了歡笑叫好和鼓掌聲。學生爲了競選遊行，特請准校方，下午第一課全體公假。到晚上六時，又假校內體育館舉行競選晚會，由各班作簡單的競選演講，並演出了特編的競選歌舞等節目。</p>
<p>水利系二年級的宣傳標語說：「水二是水牛，不是黃牛」。而他們競選詞句：「橫眉冷對貪官指，恨他們競選時謊話連篇。俯首甘爲同學牛，勉自己當選後忠誠如一」。「北風早殺，豺狼快死快滾，莫再戀綫誤蒼生。春意漸濃，水牛勤耕勤種，一切幸勞爲大衆」。含意皆殊深刻。</p>
<p>幾天來的競選宣傳，已把交大校內空氣拉入到熱烈的境地，今天分發選票就開始投票，全校已安置了八十隻投票箱，那十班勝利當選，到下星期一總開票時就可知道。</p>
<h3>中紡董事頂屋事監委署調查完畢劉維熾調用公款部份「假公濟公」並無責任</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中紡司新任董事鄧公玄等頂屋事，經監院蘇浙區監委行署調查後，其責任業憶大致確定。根據調査，中紡前任常董陳啓天，，迄至目前止，仍佔住於中紡董事招待所內，且舉凡陳氏所用物件，亦由該公司供應。其夫人且曾向外界聲明因陳氏患病需住該處休養，但因陳氏之佔住該處而釀成新任董事之頂屋則屬實情。其次孫九　董事之頂屋經過，係全部由該公司辦理妥當　孫氏前往居住者，孫氏旣夫親往頂屋，更未經手款項，故並無責任。鄧氏頂屋經過，聞亦非親自辦理，而秘書郭英　則係自己領款，自己辦理，顯屬不當。惟此事經過，與劉維熾均無涉。監委行署調查完畢，其報告不日卽　可公佈。其次關於劉維熾調用公款一千八百萬事，行署調查結果，確定係「假公濟公」，且於短期內已歸還，劉本人無責任。</p>
<h3>中研院京滬各研究所　暫時不考慮遷台計劃　經費困難亟盼設法解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國立中央研究院設有歷史語言，數學，社會科學，地質，動物，植物，化學，心理，醫學，工學，天文，氣象，物理等十三研究所。現除歷史語言，數學二所遷台，社會科學，地質二所尚留京外，其餘九研究所皆集中上海。前於局勢緊張時，當局曾計劃將京滬各研究統所遷台灣，院內各研究員因感長途遷移，將使器材遭受損失，人員星散，工作停頓，多不戈贊同。現局勢暫吿穩定，遷移之說遂提起。</p>
<p>中央研究院一如其他政府學術機關與學校，經費問題最感嚴重。本年度預算立法院尚未通過。各所經常費除公共開支外，至今敎部共撥付二次，第一次每所五千元，第二次五萬元，該一經費與實際開支相差甚遠，各所遂多賴借支維持。最近敎部自廣州來電表示卽可匯出京滬台各研究所經費共五百萬元，但滬地各所單袛三月份水電煤氣電話各項公共開支預算已需八百萬元。前次在滬人負曾決議推派代表去京請願增撥經費，後因朱家驊院長自穗返滬，遂由朱院畏去京與有關方面商討解決辦法。</p>
<p>中央研究院現有研究員及副研究員共百餘人，彼等待遇按七十五倍標準算，每月平均在一萬五千元左右，除宿於院內外膳食目理。在此艱困之情形下，彼等仍不放棄數年來埋首其中之研究工作，以冀有所成就。研究儀器方面，目前尚差够應用，前數年請得外匯陸續向國外訂購補充，去年一年則未有外匯。</p>

<h3>社會局長表示　指數計薪不變　與民生有關各業仍予管制理髮價目將採用指數計算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨日訪晤社會局局長曹沛滋，詢問關於公用事業日前決定按照關元計算價格後，職工方面可能循此原則，向資方要求以關元計算薪金。據曹氏表示：生活指數計算薪金，非常科學，在未有較此更完美之方法前，決不考慮任何變更之要求。繼詢外傳向國家銀行貸款，扶植各民營工廠一節，曹氏稱：此事困難甚多，尚未考　及此。據渠所知，各廠原料三月份內決無問題，目前有關三小廠資方前來請求停工，均予拒絕。至近來物價高漲，與大衆生活發生密切關係者，仍予管制，如理髮業近來漲價太高，頗不合理，已比照戰前價目，分成若干等級，每一等級定一基數，乘每月公佈之生活指數，卽爲理髮之新價目。刻此項辦法已呈送市府核議，如於市政會議獲得通過，浴業及旅館業等，可能亦循此原則去做。</p>
<h3>銀牛聲勢日盛生涯亦苦亦甘　交易基礎建築在廣大薪水階級</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕近年來上海有一件值得注目的事實，那就是銀元販子的聲勢日益壯大。在當局經濟決策一變再變而終至三變的罅隙裏，這些被稱爲「銀元黃牛」的一羣已從老北門基地，擴充到河南路，杏花樓，跑馬廳，靜安寺，徐家匯，同孚路，霞飛路，幾乎分佈了上海所有頗佔重要的地區，和大家睽違十四年的銀洋今日竟仍得東山再起，金圓劵價值的消長從「銀牛」手中直接而深入地吿訴每一個市民。</p>
<p>「銀牛」的陣容雖在日趨壯大，但他們當初的出現却是極其偶然的。遠在中原黃泛區決戰前後，中共控制區內爲了全力吸收政府區物資，鼓勵民衆以單帮方式，進出豫·鄂，皖·湘之間，零星套購，因爲他們對銀元規定折價頗高，所以銀元也就成了套購目標之一·那時武漢三湘蚌蕪附近，地接戰區，一旦銀元大量被高價吸取，上海投機商人豈不知情，於是立刻匯集游資，秘密設號，聯絡上江，在他們的調配號召下，少數「銀牛」遂開始出現在老北門一帶；不過初期露面，絡不免掩掩飾飾，交易未見十分熱閙。</p>
<p>露天市塲分佈各區</p>
<p>直到去年八一九限價開放，湘鄂銀元黑市價格猛騰。這時候各地戰火正熾，實際國共區域間交易已减，倒是滬漢間交易轉盛，漢口帮，長沙帮，蘇北帮，皖南帮，再加上無數單帮都紛紛來滬殷殷覓求，於是「銀牛」的露天市塲也就分展各馬路佔地開業，叮噹響處，規模漸具。</p>
<p>僅僅短短地一個多月，這本輕利重的屬於「銀牛」們的黃金時代就迅速消逝了，長江上游各省市開始施用政治壓力，使銀元黑市價格慘跌，客帮裏足，「銀牛」營業範圍袛得萎縮到純以賣出買進的差額來維持，但使人費解的是他們的「從業」人數反而日見增加。它的對象自然不能不限於兩種人：意在儲蓄，或是等待急用，因爲進出手續便捷，數目也不像黃金龐大，尤其它的交易基礎可以建築在廣大的薪水階級，商店職員，甚至車夫，娘姨等等之上，所以倒相當能保持一個「生涯鼎盛」的局面。生意最忙的時候，銀鈔兩交，在袖底下授受了事，連「夾銅」，「啞板」都無暇細辦。</p>
<p>外來困擾時有發生</p>
<p>脫離了投機商的支持而去「單獨作戰」的「銀牛」，在營業上可說是亦苦亦甘。外來的困擾和警局的捕捉，隨時都會發生。有一次「銀牛」接着一個士兵模樣的顧客，要賣出，價錢敲定了，「銀牛」一疊一疊地數鈔票給他，數着數着「顧客」忽然不見，連忙往人叢裏拉到一個穿制服的，「長官」洋鈿呢？」這位「長官」不大好惹，眼睛一翻，打起上江滬白來：「個佬子，啥子洋鈿？」但平時總還算波瀾不興，因爲他們彼此間的聯擊本身就形成一種價格，所以無需對時局影響，特別關心或確具認識，對市塲和顧客當然也不會絕對忠實。有一次「銀牛」把賣出價格高兩檔，一個顧客買進三塊銀洋後發覺吃了虧，上去理論，「銀牛」竟來個不理不睬，結果顧客祗有向警察訴屈了，誰知這警察答非所問地反向他提出一個問題：「你知道這黃牛姓什麼？</p>
<p>專以低價購進雜洋</p>
<p>銀元的交易價格何以始終以「袁頭」爲首，歷久不衰？這在「銀牛」們也不知其所以然的緣由·按理「袁頭」含銀袛占百分之九十，論價實在不應高過含銀百分九十二至九十五的「鷹洋」和「龍洋」。江南一帶農村中最近不成文地規定銀洋八元換米一石，銀元是指定要「鷹洋」的，這是因爲他們傳統的迷信「鷹洋」成色，上海米商去松嘉一帶採辦食米的，也曾一度在市面搜購「鷹洋」，但是「鷹洋」價格始終並未因此竄越「袁頭」·據「銀牛」們說：也有人專以低價購進「小頭」，「川洋」，「香港銀元」等雜洋，那是對財金改革方案公布後銀元將會同價使用存着幻想。</p>

<h3>春江水暖話「渡江」</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　麗天</p>
<p>〔本報涌口一日訊〕根據軍方所獲各方情報及我所接觸到來自江北各地各階層人民的報吿，關於「解放」後的江北近况，可以槪括的綜合的得到這樣一個結論，就是：儘管大江南岸，尤其是京滬一帶，對和談聽得震天價響，但在這裏是旣聽不到一點和平的聲響，也看不到一些和平的氣息的。在這裏，所聽到的與看到的，只是「儘速大力完成一切渡江準備」，「打到南京去，活捉×××」，「響應上級號召，進行革命到底。」</p>
<p>原來目從永城以東</p>
<p>青龍集會戰結束，國軍邱淸泉·李彌·兩兵團繼黃百韜·黃維·孫元良三兵團被「吃」以後，五十天來，陳毅與劉伯承所受的損失，據報已以驚人速度整補完成。這其中因劉伯承主力早已調回大別山及中原軍區不計外，陳毅部在去年九月濟南會戰時本尚僅有野戰軍十五個縱隊，但五個月來，除原有損失早已補充就緒外，並已擴充至廿五個縱隊達五十餘萬人。這廿五個縱隊，除以八個縱隊駐戌山東及蘇北徐海一帶外，其餘十七個縱隊悉駐江淮之間，計蘇北運河綫淮陰揚州間爲十·十一·十二等三個縱隊，南通靖江一帶爲長江縱隊，天長及高郵湖西南地區揚天公路兩側爲二·三·九·渤海·快速等五個縱隊，津浦南段明光·滁縣全椒一帶爲一·四·新八·兩廣等四個縱隊，淮南鐵路之合肥及其附近爲在濟南「取義」之吳化文部改編之六·新五·新六等三個縱隊及卅七軍，巢縣附近爲七縱隊及卅五軍，另尚有番號待査之二萬五千人駐口岸附近之孔家橋嘶馬鎭一帶·以上十七個縱隊兩個軍再加上士共，其總兵力當在四十萬人以上，其指揮系統爲在運河綫及其兩側地區，由陳毅的副手粟裕負責，在津浦南段及其兩側地區，則由華東野戰軍山東兵團司令員許世友負責而由陳毅總其成。</p>
<p>近一週來，在運河綫上共軍主力全部集結至揚州·仙女廟·宜陵·嘶馬橋一帶，天長附近共軍亦分向天揚公路及六合方面移動，津浦正面共軍亦紛紛南調，據軍方判斷，共軍似在以絕對優勢的兵力，企圖侵佔靖江以南的八圩，泰縣以南的口岸，揚州施家橋以南的十二圩·六圩·瓜州·儀徵及其西南的大河口，津浦南段　河以南兩浦地區，江浦·鳥江及裕溪口等江北國軍橋頭陣地·（安慶及其以西橋頭陣地未列入。）</p>
<p>共軍對於江北國軍橋頭陣地的進攻是</p>
<p>全面的進攻？抑是各別的各個進攻？在最近未來，共軍卽將以事實來答復我們。但有一點這裏可以指出的，就是攻佔江北橋頭堡是「渡江準備」中的一個重要項目，因此，在共軍發動渡江攻勢前必先佔領整個至少大部江北國軍橋頭陣地，因爲這些橋頭陣地，同時也正是各重要河流與長江的銜接點，至少也是大江北岸保有可以停泊較大船舶的港口，共軍如不預爲佔領這些重要港口，他在運河及洪澤，高郵，　應，諸湖所興建的大量戰船就無從獲得適當的出口，這許多橋頭陣地不佔領，他的沿江公路也就無法順利興築，沿江公路無法完成，對於他部隊的運動，尤其是重砲部隊的調動是一個最大的困難，因爲他的重武器就無法靈活運用以掩護其渡江部隊過江，並予國海軍的有效損害。因此，我們在這裏不妨更爲附帶詳細說明的，共軍的渡江準備，除掉必需攻佔江北國軍大部橋頭陣地外，應該包括：（一）完成沿江公路，甚至是平行的或內綫的與外綫的兩條以上公路，（二）完成津浦鐵路：目下津浦路尚係分段行車，濟南以北洛口黃河鐵橋去秋國軍曾撤去兩節，材料仍保存在濟南，共軍正計劃重予裝修，徐州以南鐵路尚僅通到固鎭，蚌埠以北淮河大鐵橋被破壞後正積極修建，另外蚌埠以南的三四較小橋樑亦修建中，假使鐵路不修通，共軍在東北所鹵獲的大量日式美式德式重武器就無法運到江北沿江來；（三）大量渡船的興建：據報陳毅擬建築各式大小渡船一萬艘，其中除少數前在各戰塲上豳去的橡皮艇裝有馬達的舳板及民間船隻外，大部份需要臨時趕造，（四）水戰的訓練：過去的「人海戰術」到了水上可眞「英雄無用武之地」了！舉凡游泳，掌舵，搖槳，如何「敵前登陸」？如何佔領「灘頭陣地」，在在都是新的課題，也在在都需要從頭學習。</p>
<p>儘管葉劍英向南京</p>
<p>和平代表團「吹牛」，說什麽「共軍隨時可以渡江」；儘管陳毅亦自稱「抗日時期在「皖南事變」發生後，率部渡江的不就是我嗎？那時的日本海空軍較今日的國軍要勝一籌，而現在共軍力量的雄厚較之「皖南事變」時豈可同日而語？」但在這許多軍事上的實際技術上的問題沒有獲得適當解決前，如以小規模的零零碎碎的偷渡，藉以增强江南土共的實力，俾於必要時積少成多，預先佔領江南若干橋頭堡，然後策應並迎接江北共軍主力渡江固可以，但如欲在目下卽談「大舉過江」，自然是「言之過早」，何况在中共各級幹部一致認爲聖經，卽毛澤東在「目前形勢和我們的任務」一書中，一再吿試他們「沒有準備的仗不打，沒有把握的仗不打！」陳毅及其部下，在未完成充分準備前，自亦絕不致輕舉妄動的。因此，這裏的結諭是：共軍於月內發動攻佔國軍江北橋頭陣地固大有可能，如談主方過江，則勢非待至本年四五月，春江水暖完成渡江準備以後，那時「和談」的把戲自然也應已獲得結果，中共如認爲「條件滿意」，不妨先實施「政治渡江」，否則如認爲「不够滿意」時，隨着的自然是劉伯承，林彪（近據報：林彪部已有一個縱隊循平漢路南下過了黃河，）陳賡等向華中所發動的再一次主力決戰，而配合着共軍此一攻勢的，自然是陳毅所部在江南土共策應下分若干點的大舉過江了！</p>

<p>〔本報宜興廿八日訊〕縣屬徐舍區芳莊鄉福田庵，孤處村東橋畔，距村約有半里，僅有廟田十二畝零，足維一僧生活，由月坤和尚主持。月坤以該庵年久失修乃商諸地方資助，於去春興工，始回復常年舊觀，綠有蘇省佛敎會理事長靜禪僧，最近由鎭江來宜，寄宿該庵，月坤款待如賓，引爲佛門光榮。二月廿五日上午九時，有該村西埠頭李浩法之媳前往燒香，山門虛掩，推之而入。呼僧不得，自動點火，禮拜甫畢，暼見庵東牆上，挖成一洞。村人李杏九等聞訊，頓起好奇之心，約伴入庵，一探究竟。旋卽直入月坤臥房，步近雲床，乍見月坤死於血泊中，取火視之，見頭部兩刀傷，係菜刀所砍，李杏九等當卽出庵，行抵庵前河畔，瞥見靜禪和尚屍身，拋在河中，遍體鏻傷，似遭木棍擊擊者。至該兩僧死因，一時言人人殊，據開兇手綫索，已由靜觀和尚被縛之麻繩上找獲，現正緝捕中。</p>

<h3>烏瞰駐馬店</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　房滄浪</p>
<p>〔本報信陽廿六日訊〕記者團專車北進的前六小時（上午三時）距離信陽十三公里的彭家灣車站，突被土匪廿餘人洗刦一空·站長脚上的鞋子，也被搶去。消息傳來，信陽車站上的空氣分外緊張，但我們的「派爾」却豪不氣餒，靜待鐵甲車在北巡途中的報吿之後，終於準時出發，李本一軍長爲了關切記者們的安全，特囑隨車護送的突擊部隊，在車頭車尾兩輛摩托車後，都架起機槍，同行的軍部副參謀長富光，也　起美式衝鋒槍，跳上車來。</p>
<p>中原板蕩　盜賊　起</p>
<p>離開信陽向北，我們走向另一領域了，鐵路兩側的印象，是荒蕪，凄凉，陰森，緊張，等景氣交織而成的畫面。由淮河大橋·長台關·明港·確山·以迄駐馬店·在信陽·確山兩縣所屬的鐵路東西兩傍，我們只看到三條瘦弱的耕牛，看到十餘處被飢火燒去的村莊，看到纍纍的新墳，看到那苦難的人民，將野草黑麵煮成一鍋湯，那樣子好像牛尾湯裏加進了香菜，吃得怪有味。吃到一點兒黑麵，便算幸運極了，不然，只好做强盜，搶了吃。十一年的戰禍，在大河以南的土地上，據官方估計，在三千二百八十四萬人口中，打死的和餓死的，無從估計，活着等死的，至少還有三四萬人在挨餓。現在，中原板蕩，盜賊逢起，這責任應該加諸誰呢？那已死的和等死的，到現在顯然還沒弄明白，於是，壯者就挺而走險，點者就乘機模擬土共初期的做法，擁槍而自霸一鄉，向兩邊做出可憐的眉眼，靜觀待變，這現象實無異於漢時黃巾賊起的動亂時代的一張新的「拷貝」。</p>
<p>雲長駐馬·縣長負重</p>
<p>輕快車以騎士的姿態，跨過淮河大橋，掠過明港，勢如奔馬，車廂顚播如搖籃，但我們都沒嚷頭暈。當車停確山時，一位中學校長出身，帶着學生打游擊，從豫南淮北打到蘇北，始終沒有打垮的現任保三旅長兼確山縣長涂景唐，也跳上車來，陪我們北上。在地方武力中，這個旅不啻是張軫的一張王牌，因爲涂部的戰力和紀律，都差强人意，所以置於平漢正面的第一綫，負起了保衛確山和駐馬店的重任。現在張兵團的勁旅增防此間，更顯出這由於關雲長曾經在此駐馬的駐馬店，益發健壯而堅實。車過確山，行四十分鐘，抵達豫南最前綫之駐馬店，時月台上已站滿歡迎記者團之各界代表。我們一行下車，向駐軍孫副旅長賴團長，各界首長，當地士紳慰問後，即應邀步行至天主堂休息。沿途但見五步一崗，十步一哨，而且每一橫街及十字路口，均佈有警戒哨，其保護之周密，氣象之森嚴，爲前所未見。</p>
<p>危險地帶·冷槍猛放</p>
<p>據孫副旅長談：駐馬店土寨周約十華里，寨內人口約有五萬餘，每日南去北往之過客，約有二萬人，大小機關多至五十餘，寄居於此的行政機構，有兩個行政督察專負公署，以及遂平·汝南·泌陽等十九個流亡縣政府。加上駐軍及各縣地方團隊，總數實有十萬人。這慕爾小鎭，距離最前綫的戰壕，最近的只有七華里。我們到達時，在車站鐵路兩側不遠的地方，戰壕內已伏滿了頭戴鋼盔的戰鬥兵，他們須刻刻防備襲擊，並且還要經常防制那潛伏在寨裏的最少在百數以上的便衣土共，任務是非常艱巨，所以他們特將全寨劃爲五個警戒區，而由車站至天主堂長壽街這一地區，却是一個最危險地帶，不時有人放冷槍，這複雜情形，實遠過於抗戰時期的界首。</p>
<p>第二天鎮·市塲流動</p>
<p>我們在天生堂休息片刻，在招待會席上，聽取孫副旅長及商會王理事長報吿當地情况後，旋利用分組會餐之便，分別至寨內外自由採訪，參觀市容。這裏是平漢綫上的豫南第二大鎮，距離第一大鎮的漯河，計五十六公里，北距遂平縣城，僅四十五華里，東距正陽七十華里，西南距泌陽，約有一百十華里，南距確山四十五華里，東南鉅汝南六十五華里東北距上察一百華里，西北距舞陽一百四十華里，爲豫南最低之盆地，大雨季節寨內水深可以及膝，沒有河道，居民均用井水，但街之兩旁的下水溝，做得很好，市容相當整潔。滿街的攤販，說明了這個市塲的流動性。鐵路的站長，經常在車上辦公。到站的機車，必須立刻掉頭，已經成了習慣。商業以雜糧·棉花·紗·布·烟業·紙張·糖·鹽·油·猪肉爲大宗。</p>
<p>漯駐之間·商車驟减</p>
<p>現因共方大軍壓境，北來的烟葉·棉花，南來的紙張·紗布，均不多。來往於漯駐之間的商車，亦由每日百餘輛，减至二三十。包括十二種捐稅的統一徵收所，稅收已大爲减色，而以各色各樣姿態，活躍在這一根蠟燭頭上的雙方情報人員及反間活動，則從未間歇。靠偷運禁品走私發大財的傢伙，又去而復來，信眞是一個冒險家的樂園。物資交換站，情報交易所，祗苦了在糧柴兩荒下，苟延殘喘的當地窮人們，他們幾乎每夜要被那可惡的槍聲驚醒。</p>

<h3>金銀恢復自由買賣後　國行力能穩定市塲　徐財長在招待記者席上表示穩定市塲國行已有一套辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財長徐堪與國行總裁劉攻芸昨於記者招待會中答記者間，强調政府必有力量穩定目前波動之市塲·劉氏稱；國行抽緊銀根之辦法甚多，而此次新方案公布後，國行拋售之工具，更增加至棉紗，食糖，國營事業股票，外匯移轉證及金銀等五種。國行將視實際需要，隨時拋售任何一種物資。而拋售之目的，在吸收金圓券，而並非在抑平物價。目前發行數字，雖保持機密，惟按目前美金牌價，不到二千萬美金，卽可將已發行之金圓劵全部收回。至於如何穩定各項市塲，國行現有一套辦法，正在商討。徐氏亦一再說明金銀恢復自由買賣後，國行必有力穩定市塲。數月來設非國行接連拋售物資，恐各物市價尙不止今日之情形。</p>

<h3>絲綢飛揚</h3>
<p>人絲昨日市况繼續挺秀，行情急遞好轉，市上銀根先鬆後緊，暗息先低後高，午收時一致上揚。</p>
<p>120號天橋晨開八二萬元有供，部份散戶鑒於銀根緊俏，暗息昂升，頗多脫貨放息，塲上初時供售尙多，市勢略見軟弱，後聞外埠游資續有到埠，而金融性物品連日遭受壓制，游資轉向外流，十一時後買風突盛，市勢激揚，終以八八萬高盤午收。午後銀根轉鬆，金鈔低後回升。圈外物價均無小面，故多頭放膽前進，市勢再見高價叩百萬邊關盤旋，而回小至九六〇〇〇〇元了結。</p>
<p>生絲昨市以外匯證走勢尙平，業內人心初尙觀望，市勢尙無波動，繼聞圈外物價齊升，市勢亦見上揚。優級零担先見九五萬元，本帮納胃尙濃，行情逐步高升，中間盤旋於百萬元，最後趨勢未弱，高後續見盤升，結果以一〇三萬午收。</p>
<p>綢縀因原料飛揚，人心亦昇，業中銀根略見鬆弛，但暗息仍高，執戶扳持不已，行情終見軋升，美亞晨開五六萬，開後一度升至五七萬。嗣聞金價又起回風，銀根先弛後緊，浮多乘高吐售，行情卽回見五五萬，低後抬面再進，喊價又升，盤旋於五六萬左右。近午各物大勢均好，人心甚堅，由五六萬升至五六萬八千元收市。</p>
<h3>市塲散步</h3>
<p>看台客　如　開放美國金價美元可能跳漲五成</p>
<p>開放金銀交易，財部已先後核准穗滬設立金銀公開市塲。本市金業交易所，不願背了風險投出復業費，寗把塲地權轉移給證交，舊經紀人跟着轉移過去。</p>
<p>當然囉，金價劵急須上市開拍；金銀市塲的實現，也就急不及待了、</p>
<p>國際金銀交易，也開始從統制傾向開放。連美國方面，也有恢復世界自由金市的主張。</p>
<p>最近，紐約每日論壇報，也有人投文主張建立自由金市。大意美國生產尙未過剩，世界對美國貨的需要正股，所以美國大可放棄每盎司卅五美元的純金官價，在世界需要美匯的結果，純金價可能跌至每盎司廿美元。</p>
<p>這等於說：世界的金價可能對美元跌掉四五成。卽美鈔從而將對金價狂漲四五成</p>
<p>不過，美國是國際貨幣基金會大老板，國際標準貨幣就用美元做單位的。假使美國眞的放棄純金官價，美匯對世界金價的大漲，雖然確有可能；但國際間匯市秩序的騷動不巳，也就大有可能。</p>
<p>昨晨初開時銀根很緊，午後大鬆，行局且有公開的鉅額差出。</p>
<p>股市是最敏感的，開盤後，不以銀根仍緊，就止疲急升，接着就紛紛漲停。影響所及，商品市塲的情勢，也就大變。午後哄動更烈。</p>

<h3>世界拳王「褐色轟炸機」　喬路易退休　十二年來拳賽收入近四百萬美金</h3>
<p>「我巢於退休，退休使我心上綠去重負，我自己覺得不堪再戰，與其在拳壇失去錦標，不如自動退出爲妙。』</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕弗羅列遠州米亞美城一日電：褐色轟炸機喬路易今日正式宣佈退休，此被喬路易覇佔達十二年之世界重量拳王賣座，遂又自今日起虛懸。</p>
<p>喬路易退休後，並非表示從此興拳壇隔絕。渠巳請准全美拳擊協會，主辦新拳王決賽，由二度被渠擊敗之華爾葛與名拳手却爾斯對壘。比賽將於六月間在芝加哥舉行，預定十五回合</p>
<p>喬路易與華爾士，諾里斯組織國際拳擊會，在紐約與芝加哥俱有辦事處。華爾葛-却爾斯之會戰，卽由此新成立之組織主持。路易謂華·却兩人俱已簽字答允出塲，並謂兩人均同意於新拳王產生後九十天內，接受沙華特或李斯納維區之挑戰。</p>
<p>路易之退休申請書，係由渠秘書孟道爾送至全美拳擊協會，經審核後由負責人格林宣佈。格林並稱：路易主辦奪標賽以決定新拳王之計劃，該會巳詳加檢討，「將予以協助」。又謂：「華·却二人決賽後並非卽可穩居寳座。該賽之優勝者必須簽訂合同，保蹬沙華特或李斯納維區於最短時期內有機會向錦標保持人挑戰。</p>
<p>路易之退休，使一向經手主辦拳王大賽之二十世耙體育會負責人喬柯斯爲之嗒然。喬柯斯原尙計劃於今夏爲路易排辦一幕盛大之錦標賽。此項突然傳來之消息，使喬柯斯不得不放棄一切計劃。渠甚至宣稱：「將不得不隨路易退休。」</p>
<p>退休後之路易，仍計劃行進中南美之旅行表演賽。</p>
<p>喬路易今年三十四歲，自一九三七六月廿二日在芝加哥擊倒白道克起，至今日退休止，保持拳王頭銜達十一年八月又七日。爲拳擊史上第一人。</p>
<p>路易同時又爲最年輕之拳王，渠首次奪得拳王寳冕時年才廿三歲，路易出身寒苦，一九一四年五月十三日出生於亞里巴麻州一木棚中。</p>
<p>一九三四年路易第一次在職業拳壇出手時收入僅五十元。自此卽一帆風順，至今年爲止，渠賽拳所得之收入，據「拳壇」雜誌統計，已達三百八十八萬七千三百廿三元。</p>
<p>又喬路易今晚宣稱：渠認華-却會戰在芝加哥體育塲舉行，地位恐嫌狹小，故「尙未正式決定將在何處舉行。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社福羅里達州米亞美一日電〕世界重量級拳王黑人喬路易今日正式致函全國拳擊委員會，聲明自動退休，並要求准其創辦國際拳擊總會，主辦拳撃賽，拳擊委員會已准其所請。</p>
<p>喬路易自一九三七年登王座以來，保持常勝軍榮膺，此次毅然退休，以酬素志，拳迷均爲婉惜</p>
<p>據喬氏稱：「我樂於退休，退休使我心上釋去重負，我自己覺得不堪再戰，與其在拳壇失去錦標，不如自動退出爲妙。」</p>
<h3>巴哈麻島羣衆夾道歡迎拳王</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴哈麻羣島那沙奧一日電〕拳王喬路易今日抵此作表演賽，自機塲驅車入城時夾道歡迎之羣衆達數萬，情况之熱烈，尤在一九四〇年溫莎公爵抵此就任巴哈麻總督時之上。</p>

<p>麥令昨晚攻勢凶猛，海靑開塲中一罰球，從此麥令卽行領前，但七比五後，卽被海靑一氣三隻，局面改變。海靑善用「反彈傳球」，籃下活動，更佔便宜，麥令隊長利斯前後奔波賣力，上半時海靑十八，麥令十六。休息續戰，海靑兩黑炭長力充沛，雙方五度平手，各卅後，麥令發威，高弗來利斯·萊姆山等，進出自由，終塲爲四三比卅九，麥令斯勝。</p>

<h3>港銀牌足球　傑志戰勝警察將與南南決賽</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕香港的特別銀牌足球半決賽，自從上星期六南華南以一比零打敗聖約瑟後，第二天傑志亦以二比一戰勝了警察。今後將要看南南與傑志兩隊爭奪錦標了。</p>
<p>說到傑志對警察的一塲九十分鐘比賽，看得人膽戰心驚，每一分鐘都是狂濤駭浪，警察門前人仰馬翻，前後不下十餘次之多。傑志因受傷而離塲的則有趙富，張松根，黃景聰三人，同時雙方受警吿的球員也有多人，由此可見球賽怎樣在緊張刺激中進行。</p>
<p>這次傑志能勝警察，全憑三軍用命，士氣如虹，各將勇往直前，並無怯塲之病。傑志的中衛綫游華興踢來最好，能把侯律。哥頓看牢，絕不放鬆半步，前鋒各將頗收合作之效。「顚馬」趙富演來稍有頭腦，亞祺與松根分任兩鋒已盡忠職守，姚卓然頗見進步，盤射均有工夫，假以時日，此子大有前途。景聰任左翼也能與中路呼應，整條前鋒由始至終尙能呵成一氣。這次由艱難困苦的塲面中取得勝利，實在難得。</p>

<h3>足球友誼賽　鐵路戰英海軍一比一成和局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中英足球友誼賽，鐵路對英海軍，昨日下午四時在逸園舉行。英水兵爲倫敦號艦球隊，雙方議定採用英國足球規則，不准調人，每隊以十一人爲限，鐵路健將蕭子文因姗姗來遲，卒至不能上塲。英軍攻勢猛烈，上半時先中一球，鐵路直至最後十分鐘才爲吳炳浩連人帶球滾入，才平反戰局，打成各一平手而終，鐵路免於城下之盟。下半時英軍因中堅勃培琪球中眼部受傷，祗剩十人作戰到底。逸園觀衆僅千人左右而已。</p>
<p>鎭路隊</p>
<p>廖雄</p>
<p>岳仁孝　吳嘉邦</p>
<p>陸炳生　高保正　曹於明</p>

<p>葛萊許　費史東</p>
<p>達特萊　勃培琪　麥塞斯</p>
<p>地萊特　西姆斯　赫格斯　傑姆斯　威爾遜</p>
<p>這是一塲力的比賽，英水手個個如牛，身高力大，奔跑迅速，動作又快。鐵路在任何方面都比不上，力氣够不上，身材够不上，上半時處處佔下風，祗見英軍一再攻擊。中鋒赫格斯最佳，惜乎前鋒沒有聯絡沒有組織，否則早獲大勝，祇見滿塲飛奔，高球來往而已。下半時英水手以十人作戰到底，鐵路因上半時用力猛烈，下半時似有疲態，滿以爲翻身無望，吳炳浩喜出望外，鐵路不敗，實爲大幸。</p>
<p>上半時英軍攻擊猛烈，鐵路祇在前後追隨，因英軍採用攻勢，後衛過於挺出，所以數次鐵路突擊，亦頗生效，惜乎林典羲有一次遲到一步，射門太準，適中球門手內，吳炳浩瞿錫根遠射，亦無效果。有一次英軍中堅勃培琪險鬧倒戈。直到半小時後，英中鋒赫格斯盤過三關，一舉成功，先開紀錄，上半時一比零。下半時勃培琪傷眼，英軍十人作戰，全取守勢，精彩全失，鐵路亦露疲態。最後十分鐘張傑得球直　，左傳陸慶祥，陸跳起一頂，泰特曼接得滑落，吳炳浩連人帶馬，滾入網底，於是一比一終局。</p>

When a reporter asked if now was the time for peace talks, Cheng Qian replied without hesitation: "Now is a very good time to talk peace." However, when asked about the Communist Party's eight conditions, Cheng Qian avoided criticism. According to Cheng Qian, Hunan is currently very stable. There have been occasional disturbances by small groups of bandits in western Hunan recently, but these are local bandits and not Communists. Cheng Qian denied the rumor that Hunan Province had issued provincial currency, saying that he had not brought any suggestions or reform plans with him. When asked about the issue of unity, Cheng Qian said that they should have united long ago. Finally, Cheng Qian said that it had been a long time since his last visit to Nanjing, and that the situation had changed and was now much better than the last time he came. After the speech, Cheng Qian went to the Capital Hotel to rest.</p>

<h3>Yan Huiqing Told Mayor Wu at the Airport He Wanted to Discuss the Shanghai Problem With Him. Zhang Shizhao and Du Yuesheng Also Had a Conversation.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] When Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong arrived at Longhua Airport yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu also went to meet them. After Yan got off the plane, he immediately said to Mayor Wu: "I have the Shanghai problem and your problem to discuss with you." The Mayor smiled and asked: "What problem do I have? How is Shanghai?" Yan replied, "That's your business." Wu then asked, "Are there any specific solutions?" Yan said: "Very good." At 12:20 PM, they each got into cars and returned to their residences. Mayor Wu then drove to Yan Huiqing's residence in the afternoon at 3 PM for a long conversation, leaving only after half an hour. Ling Xianyang of Shanghai University also visited in succession. Another peace representative, Zhang Shizhao, visited Du Yuesheng to exchange views. It is generally speculated that the topic of discussion was centered on the future of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Three Elders, Yan, Zhang, and Jiang, Arrive in Shanghai, Saying the Door-Knocking Mission Has Been Completed but They Are Not Concerned with the Peace Negotiation Terms. Zhang Qun and Yu Youren Had Long Conversations With the Four Gentlemen.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The group of three peace elders, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, flew back to Shanghai from Nanjing on the afternoon of the 2nd. The envoys responsible for the door-knocking mission have finally completed their task. Those who went to Longhua Airport to meet them yesterday included Mayor Wu Guozhen, representing Acting President Li, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Gu Chunfan, and the families of Yan, Jiang, and Zhang. After Yan Huiqing got off the plane, he said to reporters: "If both sides can be open and honest, they can definitely talk. As the ancient saying goes: 'Do not do unto others what you would not want done unto yourself.' If we adhere to this principle and treat each other with sincerity, we will definitely succeed." Yan seemed satisfied with his trip to Beiping, but still emphasized that "there are still many difficulties, but there is great hope." When asked about the Communist Party's attitude towards punishing war criminals, Yan said: "We don't care about these conditions. Our mission is to knock on the door. Now we have accomplished our mission and opened the door. It is up to both sides to conduct peace talks." When asked if Yan would go to Nanjing or Beiping again, Yan replied: "No. After this, it's a matter for the government." Yan also said that the people hope for peace, so we conveyed the people's opinions to the Communist Party, and the Communist Party also understands. When asked if the Communist Party's views on peace were consistent, Yan said: "I don't know. In Beiping, we met all the important people of the Communist Party, and we have heard all their opinions. Now we have reported this situation to the government." Yan and others declined to disclose any other details about their time in Beiping.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Yan, Jiang, and Zhang returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 2nd. Shao Lizi did not travel with them. Zhang Qun visited the four members of the peace delegation on the morning of the 2nd to exchange views on the peace issue, engaging in a conversation for almost two hours. In addition, Yu Youren, Gan Jiehou, Cheng Shewo, Cheng Cangbo, and others also visited. After the talks, Yan and others went to the airport. Before boarding the plane, Zhang Shizhao said to Shao: "Please take care of everything." This confirmed that the continued contact between the delegation and the government would be Shao's responsibility. Yan Huiqing also repeatedly said to Shao Lizi before leaving: "Please take care of everything, I beg you! I beg you!" Yan also told reporters that "we must slowly walk towards the road to peace. If the government needs us to come to Nanjing, we can still come at any time." It is said that after Yan, Jiang, Zhang, and Shao returned to Nanjing this time, only two or three government officials were able to learn about the content of their conversations with the Communist Party, in addition to the report to Acting President Li. Therefore, rumors that the delegation brought back the Communist Party's conditions, such as concessions on the issue of war criminals but insistence on reorganizing the army, are mostly speculations. In fact, the Communist Party would not present specific conditions to the peace delegation. Their greatest achievement was to communicate the views of both the North and the South on peace. The number of representatives from both sides will be the same in future negotiations. The Communist Party's representatives have already been determined, and the government's representatives are currently being discussed. Huang Shaohong is still firmly resigning and has already gone from Nanjing to Hong Kong. The government will find a suitable replacement, and the other three may not be changed.</p>
<h3>People's Representatives May Also Be Present</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to sources close to the Shanghai peace delegation: The Communist Party has agreed that in future peace talks, in addition to official government representatives, people's representatives may also be present. Gan Jiehou will come to Shanghai in the next day or two to discuss this matter with people from all walks of life in the city. Yan Huiqing is also scheduled to hold a press conference in the next two to three days to report on his trip to the north.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Monitoring Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In its radio news broadcasts, the Communist Party has repeatedly mentioned the Taiwan issue in recent days, which is enough to show its monitoring trend. Yesterday's broadcast also announced that Taiwanese compatriots in Beiping held a "February 28th" Revolution second anniversary commemoration meeting in Beiping on February 28th. Zhao Yimin, Minister of Propaganda of the Communist Party's Beiping Municipal Committee, as well as Chen Qiyuan, Zhang Naiqi, Tian Han, An E, and others attended. The conference passed a resolution to pay tribute to Mao and Zhu and issued a letter to compatriots across the country, stating that the Kuomintang is signing secret agreements with American imperialism in an attempt to sell Taiwan to the United States and turn Taiwan into an American colony. "If we want to smash the reactionary rule of the last bastion of the Kuomintang reactionaries, only under the leadership of the Communist Party can Taiwan be liberated, and only then can the people of Taiwan obtain true democracy and freedom."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 1st] The "Taiwan Liberation League" issued a statement today, reiterating its appeal to the people of Taiwan to unite and establish "a democratic Republic of Taiwan." A spokesman for the League said: When the United Nations General Assembly meets in April, the League will send representatives to Lake Success to raise the issue of Taiwan's independence. People from the Nationalist government said that the League only represents "a very small number of elements who previously cooperated with Japan." However, well-informed observers believe that its foundation is more extensive. Recently, General MacArthur announced that Taiwan is still subordinate to the Allied Supreme Command and is only "occupied" by China until a peace treaty with Japan is signed, which has a stimulating effect on the League's activities. Neutral parties attach great importance to the recent trip to Japan by some members of the League.</p>
<h3>Economic Cooperation Administration to Submit New Legislation to the US Congress for Aid to China; Estimated Monthly Need is US$20 Million</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 1st] Lapham, Director of the China Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration, told reporters on the afternoon of the 1st: The Economic Cooperation Administration will "soon" submit new legislation for economic aid to China to Congress, but the Administration has not yet made any requests for the necessary funds or made any estimates.</p>
<p>Lapham said: The Economic Cooperation Administration currently needs approximately US$20 million per month for its aid program in non-Communist-occupied areas where the Administration is working, but he denied rumors that he had told the Supervisory Committee that the Economic Cooperation Administration would need US$240 million per year to continue aid to China. He explained that this was only an estimate based on the current level at the request of the members of the Committee. He also said: "If our policy stipulates that we will not continue to work in Communist-occupied areas, we will not need as much as US$240 million."</p>
<p>He said that he supports continuing economic aid to China, but he believes that the "smartest thing to do" at present is to extend the legislative authority to allow the current plan to be implemented until the end of June this year (currently, according to Congress's approval, this plan can only be implemented until April 3rd).</p>
<p>Lapham also said that the Chinese Communist Party "at least for the time being" seems to be staying on the north bank of the Yangtze River north of Shanghai, but "if they really want to move forward, there is no way to stop them." He said: If they really take over Shanghai, "I believe that our work in that area will largely be suspended." He also said that the goods stored by the Economic Cooperation Administration in Shanghai are mainly raw cotton, which can be used for about six weeks. He also estimated that when the Communist army took over Beiping and Tianjin, there were more than US$4 million worth of Economic Cooperation Administration supplies in those two places, including more than US$3.5 million worth of cotton textiles, and the rest was wheat and flour.</p>
<p>Lapham also said that before leaving China, he had suggested allocating US$500,000 from the Economic Cooperation Administration fund specifically for helping Chinese students in the United States. This suggestion has been agreed to in principle by the State Department, and the Economic Cooperation Administration and the State Department are currently discussing detailed implementation plans.</p>

<h3>Garrison Headquarters and Police Headquarters Separately Announce Details of the Conspiracy to Subvert the Government Case; Masterminds Wang Baozhen, Lin Difie, and Wu Rong are Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the Garrison Headquarters announced the details of the shocking case of a conspiracy to incite riots and subvert the government as follows: "The Shen Bao published on March 1st that the Nanjing and Shanghai security agencies cracked a major case of conspiracy to incite riots, attempt to create chaos, and subvert the government. After inquiring with relevant parties, we learned that several key criminals, including Wang Baozhen, Lin Difie, and Wu Rong, were also arrested in Shanghai. Wang Baozhen studied in Japan, participated in the Tongmenghui, and served as a member of the war zone party and government committee during the July 7th Incident. He is the mastermind behind the major case of conspiracy to incite riots and subvert the government. All the criminals arrested in Nanjing, as well as Xu Zhiyuan, Lin Difie, Wu Rong, and others, were under his command. Xu Zhiyuan was responsible for the organization and training of the reactionary organization, Lin Difie was responsible for propaganda, and Wu Rong was the secretary. Other conspirators are still under investigation."</p>
<p>Mastermind Wang Baozhen Travelled Between Hong Kong and Shanghai</p>
<p>The headquarters did not disclose the source of the leads and the circumstances of the case, nor did they reveal the specific plans of the reactionary organization's conspiracy. However, it was learned that during the arrests, the headquarters seized some documentary evidence such as documents and telegrams. The mastermind, Wang Baozhen, is from Shenze, Hebei Province, is 70 years old, and is a graduate of Waseda University in Japan. He joined the Tongmenghui in his early years. In the early years of the Republic of China, he was elected as a senator from Zhili Province. He founded the Minzhu Bao in Tianjin and strongly opposed Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor. In 1928, he served as a member of the Legislative Yuan and resigned soon after. Later, he joined the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee led by Li Jishen and held the title of Military Commissioner. He was also one of the representatives of the New Political Consultative Conference. This person came to Shanghai from Hong Kong in June last year to preside over a secret organization and has since frequently traveled between Hong Kong and Shanghai. After the case broke out, he and Lin Difie were first arrested in a private residence. It is said that the garrison personnel went to great lengths to find their address. In addition to Wang Baozhen, Lin Difie, and Wu Rong, there are two other suspects arrested in Shanghai in this case who are considered more important, but the Garrison Headquarters did not disclose their names yesterday.</p>
<p>Spokesman Luo Chunbo of the Garrison Headquarters Speaks</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Luo Chunbo, Director of the Political Work Department and spokesman for the Capital Garrison Headquarters, said: (A) This headquarters did indeed crack a conspiracy to incite riots in the capital earlier this month. On February 5th, this headquarters received a tip that Meng Shiheng, Director of the Central Committee and Nanjing Branch of the Chinese Revolutionary Committee, was holding a secret meeting with a liaison officer from the Communist Jianghuai Military Region at Wu Shiwen's home at 2 Daguang New Village, Daguang Road, Nanjing, at 8 PM on February 6th, plotting a riot in the capital. This headquarters then arrested the key personnel in charge of the case and captured Meng Shiheng in Shanghai and brought him to Nanjing for interrogation. According to his confession: The plan was real. The methods were as follows: (1) Control the airport, (2) Cut off traffic arteries, (3) Detain Acting President Li and important military and government leaders, (4) Establish the Nanjing People's Liberation Committee, (5) Establish the Nanjing People's Government, (6) Meet the Communist army crossing the river, and use various hometown associations, fraternity associations, and other methods to carry out military transport, constitution transport, and police transport work plans, colluding with 5,000 people, with 2,000 people rioting in the city and 3,000 people meeting the Communist army crossing the river, and sending someone to contact the Communist army for internal support. Other prisoners also admitted to participating in the organization. For example, Xia Benying, a female National Assembly representative, was the director of the organization's women's committee.</p>
<p>Meng Shiheng is the Person in Charge in Shanghai</p>
<p>(B) According to Meng Shiheng's confession, it was learned that there was also such an organization in Shanghai. Xu Zhiyuan, Commissioner of the Supervisory Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, was an important person in charge of the Shanghai organization. This headquarters then sent personnel to Shanghai to arrest Xu and bring him to Nanjing in conjunction with the Songhu Garrison Command. He is currently being secretly interrogated. (C) This case is a case of conspiracy to subvert the government through military riots and is not a political party or political prisoner issue. This headquarters is responsible for defending the capital and had to take emergency measures to arrest the necessary personnel, but it acted very cautiously and did not want to implicate anyone who was not an important member of the organization. The rumor that 70 or 80 people were involved is completely untrue. This headquarters did not arrest Qin Xiuqing and her friends. (There are some discrepancies between the report in our newspaper the day before and the facts). (D) This case is still under investigation. Once the investigation is completed, it will be reported to the higher authorities for approval. After the case is closed, if it is deemed necessary, it will be announced.</p>
<p>Qin Xiuqing Has Already Regained Her Freedom</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Meng Shiheng's wife, Qin Xiuqing, bought a copy of our newspaper at our Nanjing office on the afternoon of the 2nd. According to her, she was only under surveillance once, but she regained her freedom in a few days. However, according to Director Luo of the Garrison Headquarters, she was not arrested.</p>
<p>Tao Hongzhao of Zhenjiang Has Also Been Arrested</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 2nd] Tao Hongzhao, former Zhenjiang Garrison Commander, who was dismissed and placed under surveillance for corruption, was also involved in the conspiracy to subvert the government. It is said that he had secretly contacted the Communist army in northern Jiangsu, plotting to use his authority to detain the party and government leaders of Jiangsu Province when the Communist army launched a crossing-the-river offensive, causing the local order to fall into chaos and cutting off the Jinghu traffic, so that the capital's riot would succeed in one fell swoop. However, due to the secrecy of the matter, he was arrested, which affected the progress of his entire plan.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Brewing of a Southeast Asian League</h3>
<p>The crisis in Southeast Asia is deepening daily, and there is hardly a country that is not in turmoil. The Indonesian problem remains unresolved, and the newly independent Burma has recently experienced a rebellion by the Karen people, who are currently attacking Mandalay, Burma's second-largest city, with military force. If the central government of Burma cannot obtain substantial and effective foreign aid, it will be difficult to control the national situation. At the same time, a so-called "rebellion by reactionary elements" has also occurred in the capital of Siam, disrupting all external transportation in Bangkok. Judging from the trend of this situation, it can be seen that the situation in Southeast Asia is deteriorating. If there is no way to reverse it, it may develop to an irreversible point. In view of this, Indian Prime Minister Nehru convened a Southeast Asian British Commonwealth Conference on the 28th of last month to discuss the Burmese problem, hoping to start with resolving the Burmese problem and then seek the stability of the entire Southeast Asia. Therefore, the British Commonwealth Conference held in New Delhi will not only thoroughly resolve Burma's internal problems and seek political and economic stability for Burma, but also take concrete and effective measures, such as organizing a Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance, to protect themselves, resist foreign aggression, and seek the stability of the entire Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>In addition to the British representative, Southeast Asian High Commissioner MacDonald, and the Minister of Overseas Trade, Bottomley, attending this British Commonwealth Conference, there were also representatives from five Commonwealth countries: India, Ceylon, Pakistan, Australia, and New Zealand. The conference was chaired by the initiator, Indian Prime Minister Nehru. The main agenda items were: one, the Burmese problem, and two, the issue of organizing a Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance.</p>
<p>Regarding the Burmese problem, the representatives attending the meeting expressed their regret that a rebellion occurred soon after Burma's independence. However, because the safety of Burma has a profound and significant impact on the interests of Britain and India, and also has a major relationship with Southeast Asia, the representatives of the various Commonwealth countries particularly raised awareness of the Burmese problem in Southeast Asia, so they unanimously agreed that a way should be found to achieve a peaceful solution to the Burmese problem. However, the representatives' opinions were not entirely consistent on what steps should be taken to resolve the issue. Some advocated that Burma should cancel its independence and return to the embrace of Britain. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt once publicly pointed out that Burma's severance of ties with the British Empire was a mistake. However, others believed that economic aid alone was not enough to restore peace and prosperity to Burma, so they advocated some form of mediation. After the debate, a moderate approach was adopted, namely, to send a telegram to Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu in the name of the Southeast Asian Commonwealth Conference, proposing to seek a peaceful solution and frankly stating that economic aid to Burma would be conditional on the Burmese government reaching an agreement with the Karen people. This resolution is appropriate, and Burma's internal strife can be expected to be resolved peacefully as a result, adding another factor to the stability of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>As for the issue of organizing a Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance, because the content is complex, it cannot be achieved overnight. But what is most noteworthy is that the threat of communist forces felt by Southeast Asian countries is already a clear and obvious fact. Since the rise of the Chinese Communist Party, the southward invasion of Asian communist forces has intensified day by day, which no one can deny. Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaya, Siam, and Burma need not be mentioned, even the Philippines and India have already felt its threat. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Nehru reported to the parliament, also sternly criticizing the Communist Party for attempting to conspire a rebellion in India, he said: "The Indian Communist Party, taking advantage of the rise of the Chinese, Malayan, and Burmese Communist Parties, also wants to disrupt order in India and wants to overthrow the government by force. Fortunately, the government has taken decisive measures, and the Communist Party's conspiracy has failed. In the past ten days, as many as 870 people have been arrested for riots that were close to open rebellion." This is the real situation in India, and it is also a true reflection of the turbulent situation in Southeast Asian countries. If the situation in India is like this, it goes without saying that the situation in other countries is even worse.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, communist forces have long infiltrated Southeast Asian countries, and recently, due to the military success of the Chinese Communist Party, their arrogance has increased like a prairie fire. Indian Prime Minister Nehru initiated the Southeast Asian Commonwealth Conference, ostensibly for the internal turmoil in Burma, but in reality, wasn't it for the Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance? At the same time, for the sake of its own sense of security, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt also strongly advocated that Southeast Asia should establish an organization similar to the Western European Union to resist foreign aggression. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 28th, it is very likely that a Southeast Asian defense plan will be established. One is that everyone believes that India alone has the strength to become an anti-communist bastion; the other is that the Australian Foreign Minister is not to be outdone, believing that since Britain is busy with European affairs and has no time to look east, Australia should come out to lead the various Commonwealth countries in anti-communist self-defense. Based on this, it is highly probable that this Southeast Asian British Commonwealth Conference will decide to organize a Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance. In the past, it was often said that China was a stabilizing force in East Asia, and the world should pay attention to ensuring that this stabilizing force does not waver. It is a pity that there were too many short-sighted people, and now they may gradually feel that the wildfire is about to burn over. For the sake of peace and prosperity in Southeast Asia, we certainly hope that Southeast Asian countries will be able to establish this kind of self-defense alliance, but we still need to awaken all countries in the world that if China is not stable for a day, and China is invaded for a day, then Southeast Asia will not be stable for a day, and there will be a danger of being invaded for a day. Looking afar at Southeast Asia, we cannot but look back at how China's overall situation will evolve.</p>
<h3>Finalizing Revenue and Expenditure to Stabilize Finance - Further Improvement in Import and Export Trade - Minister of Finance Hsu Clarifies the Hopes for the New Financial Plan in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Minister of Finance Hsu Kan arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 2nd. In the afternoon at 5 o'clock, he received reporters. Mr. Hsu said: The purpose of the reception is "to frankly explain to everyone the intention and future hopes of this promulgated financial reform plan."</p>
<p>Mr. Hsu first stated: The new plan is divided into: (1) Finance, (2) Finance, (3) Import and export trade, (4) Material adjustment, (5) Material production departments. Departments (4) and (5) are not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, so only the first three departments will be explained. Briefly stated: The main purpose of the first department, finance, is to seek the verification of income and expenditure, thereby reducing the imbalance between income and expenditure. The revision of tax collection methods can be exemplified by the fact that tariffs are now paid in Customs Gold Units. The use of Customs Gold Units to pay import taxes does not reduce the use of Gold Yuan Certificates. After the implementation of Customs Gold Units, as long as the Yangtze River shipping remains smooth, it is estimated that tariffs can generate at least US$30 million per year. This greatly helps to balance financial revenue and expenditure. Excise taxes on five items, cotton yarn, cement, matches, cigarettes, and sugar, will all be levied in kind. After the government collects them in kind, it will have a large amount of materials to adjust market supply and demand. However, it will not increase the burden on each factory. Among the direct taxes, the profit-seeking enterprise income tax is now determined to adopt an assessed package payment system to achieve the principle of simple tax collection. Regarding salt tax, recently, due to insufficient capital turnover for some salt merchants and distributors, it has been decided to conduct official collection and transportation of a portion of edible salt. As for the expenditure side, it also seeks verification. The largest expenditure now is military expenditure. Because the country cannot afford it, the impact is on the corruption of discipline. After the military expenditure is increased, the morale can be expected to be boosted. Since there are many public and educational personnel and organizations, the national treasury bears a heavy burden. Therefore, in the future, it is determined to reduce and merge redundant organizations as much as possible. At the same time, efforts will be made to improve the treatment of public and educational personnel so that they can work with peace of mind. Also, in order to make the financial resources of local governments abundant, the central government has decided to assign the land tax to the local governments starting from October 1, 1949. Without hindering the central tax system, local governments can also determine their own tax systems.</p>
<p>The main aspect of the second department, finance, is to open up the free trading of gold and silver and allow silver dollars to circulate. This move is not to restore the silver standard, but to respect reality and facilitate the people. It is believed that after the free trading of gold and silver, the Central Bank can use greater strength to stabilize the market. At the same time, it is planning to increase the casting of silver dollars.</p>
<p>Regarding the third part, import and export trade, it has been improved compared to before since the Executive Yuan announced the new measures in November last year, and now it is further improved. (1) Exporters can handle imports themselves without restrictions. (2) Regarding imports, except for six items, cigarettes, petroleum products, food, cotton, and fertilizers, which still maintain a quota system, all others are relaxed as much as possible. (3) Imports with self-provided foreign exchange are also relaxed as much as possible. In the future, overseas remittances will not have a difference from the listed price of US dollars, and overseas remittances will not be evaded. However, the opening of gold and silver is still a kind of commodity trading, so import duties are still collected on the import of gold and silver.</p>
<p>Mr. Hsu concluded by saying: This new plan will never sing a high tune, and it is hoped that the current financial situation can be relatively stabilized. However, to demand that this plan be fully effective today, we must still see whether the peace talks can achieve reasonable results and whether there is a solution to the overall situation. Whether the implementation of the new plan is effective is the main key. Regarding the detailed rules for the implementation of the new plan, Mr. Hsu said that they are still being drafted and will be completed within days, and will be announced and implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan.

<h3>The Whereabouts of the Cruiser "Chongqing" Are Unknown: It Sailed from the Whangpoo River on the 26th of Last Month, Destination Unknown; Gui Yongqing Claims It Has Reached Bohai Bay</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The whereabouts of the cruiser "Chongqing" remain a mystery. The relevant authorities have yet to determine whether its departure was an escape, a purely political act, or due to other reasons. According to reliable sources, the "Chongqing" sailed from the Whangpoo River on February 26th, likely beginning its action at dusk. February 26th was a Saturday, also a weekend holiday. That afternoon, some officers and soldiers of the ship went ashore to enjoy the weekend, but to their surprise, when they returned to the dock that night, they could not find the ship. The Shanghai office of the Naval Headquarters telegraphed Nanjing on the morning of the 27th to report this. Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing rushed to order the handling of the matter. It is said that the ship carried 500,000 silver dollars prepared by the Naval Headquarters to pay the officers and soldiers and serve as emergency funds. In addition to the ship's captain, Deng Zhaoxiang, there was also a certain head of the Operations Department of the Naval Headquarters on board. The Naval Headquarters is now trying to establish telecommunications contact with the ship. The "Chongqing" is the newest and best-performing warship in our country's navy. The Naval Headquarters authorities are extremely distressed by the ship's disappearance and are now doing everything possible to find it. Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing will also broadcast to the ship's officers and soldiers in the coming days, explaining the importance of national interest and urging them to return soon.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing came to Shanghai on official business. When asked by reporters about the whereabouts of the warship "Chongqing," Gui replied, "The ship has now sailed to Bohai Bay, and I have telegraphed the captain to sail back here immediately." He refused to disclose anything further. In the evening, Gui and the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard visited Liu Gongyun, the president of the National Bank of China, to discuss loan matters for the shipyard.</p>
<p>[United Press Report from This City] A government naval spokesman admitted tonight that the cruiser "Chongqing" had sailed from the mouth of the Yangtze River on the 24th of last month and has not been heard from since. However, he neither confirmed nor denied the rumor that the ship is now under the control of the Chinese Communists in Yantai. The spokesman did not mention that government air force had spotted the ship in the waters of North China.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 2nd] A government spokesman admitted on the 2nd that a naval transport ship had sailed to the Communist area, but he said that he had not learned the name or tonnage of the ship. Regarding the rumor that the 5,000-ton cruiser "Chongqing" had sailed to Yantai to surrender to the Communist army, he said that he had not received such a report.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In recent days, a senior official of the British Far East Fleet has been in frequent contact with Commander-in-Chief Gui, and it is widely believed that the two sides must have discussed the disappearance of the "Chongqing" and may have also touched on the issue of the destroyer "Lingfu." The "Lingfu" was leased to us by the United Kingdom for five years when they gave us the "Chongqing."</p>
<h3>A Former Crew Member of the "Lingfu" Is Now a Department Store Clerk: Recounting the Past with Tears of Resentment</h3>
<p>[Reuters Report from This City] A former crew member of the destroyer "Lingfu," which was transferred from Britain to China at the same time as the cruiser "Chongqing," told this agency about the disappearance of the "Chongqing" two days ago. He believed that the main reason for the disappearance of the "Chongqing" was the immense disappointment caused by the meager treatment after the excellent young naval officers of the two ships received two years of training in England and enjoyed the same preferential treatment as their British counterparts. After the two ships sailed across the ocean from England to Shanghai, half of the crew members of the two ships requested permission from their superiors to return to their hometowns to visit relatives. Most of those who made such requests expressed their determination to leave the Chinese Navy regardless of the tasks assigned to the two ships by the naval authorities. When the personnel of the two ships left England to return home, they were full of enthusiasm, but as soon as they arrived at the country's gate, it was like having a bucket of cold water poured over them. When they arrived in Shanghai, it was during Chiang Ching-kuo's strict enforcement of the currency restriction policy. The issue of treatment was the first thing that made the young officers on the ship feel dissatisfied. During their training in England, their treatment was equal to that of the British naval personnel. After arriving in Shanghai, each person's monthly salary was only 17 gold yuan. Their skills and experience were completely ignored. As soon as the two ships entered Chinese territorial waters, the distribution of British clothing and cigarettes was immediately cancelled, although there was still plenty of such inventory on board. The crew member also told this agency: "When I requested permission to go to Qingdao to visit relatives, I was not allowed to take British-made wool socks and blankets ashore, but afterwards, these wool socks and blankets were sold publicly on Beijing Road." The crew member also said: When the two ships arrived in Singapore and Hong Kong, the local Chinese gave them a warm welcome. When they arrived in Shanghai, the bad traditional atmosphere of the Chinese Navy was immediately brought into full play, making people feel that the two years of training in England were completely wasted. The crew member finally told this agency in a painful tone: I spent two years in England training to manage the boilers of warships, but today I am working in a department store selling ties. Is this where Chinese talent ends up? How sad it is. It is reported that the crew member has now left the navy and found a job on his own.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Orders Soviet Émigré Group to Leave the Country: The Situation in Berlin Suddenly Becomes Tense; The Group Refuses to Comply and Is Trapped in the Blockade; Pro-Soviet Elements Are Active and May Launch an Incident at Any Time</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 1st] U.S. Military Governor Clay announced today that if the Soviet émigré group in the U.S. zone does not leave the country by tomorrow morning, the U.S. authorities will cut off its water, electricity, gas, telephone, and other conveniences. The U.S. authorities believe that the group's work of sending Soviet émigrés back to the Soviet Union has long been completed, so they ordered it to leave the country today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 2nd] The tense relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Germany has reached a serious climax due to the U.S. military government stationing armed guards in front of the general office of the Soviet émigré group here this morning, strictly prohibiting entry. The personnel of the Soviet émigré group are actually trapped in a blockade. U.S. Military Governor Clay, considering the seriousness of the situation, has telegraphed Washington for instructions in preparation for any eventuality. Frankfurt U.S. Commander Wut met with the head of the Soviet émigré group this morning, reiterating the demand that the Soviet émigré group must withdraw from the U.S. zone because its mission has been completed. The head of the Soviet group refused this request on the spot, stating that he would not withdraw unless he received an order to withdraw from Moscow. Afterwards, the U.S. authorities immediately sent armed guards to stand guard in front of the group's headquarters, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. Wut then suggested to the head of the Soviet group that the U.S. was willing to escort the group's personnel to the border of the Soviet zone, but the Soviet side refused again. Clay then ordered the cutting off of the group's electricity, telephone, and gas, thus completely isolating the group. After this news spread, many Germans gathered on the streets of Frankfurt, anticipating the occurrence of chaos. Pro-Soviet elements in the crowd were eager to try and may launch an incident at any time. The U.S. military authorities have also taken emergency precautionary measures. It is reported that the group was established based on the Potsdam Agreement to oversee the repatriation of Soviet refugees in the U.S. zone of Germany. Clay ordered the group to close last week, but was refused. Last night, Moscow sent a note to the U.S. Embassy protesting Clay's order to leave the country, stating that this action directly violated the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. This morning, U.S. Commander Wut also ordered the Soviet émigré group to remove the Soviet flag in front of its office, but as of noon today, the Soviet flag was still flying. When Wut talked to reporters about this matter. Robertson (British), Cornish (French), and Shi Qi in Berlin are all closely watching the development of this matter. Although Robertson refused to comment, citing that this matter was a U.S. affair, he expressed moral support for Clay's attitude. Cornish said that it would not be difficult for the Soviet Union to launch an incident, because there are indeed pro-Soviet elements among the German people.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister to Visit Germany Tomorrow: Four-Day Stay to Inspect Airlift Measures</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] It was officially announced here today that British Prime Minister Attlee is scheduled to visit Germany from the 4th to the 7th of this month to inspect the airlift measures of the British authorities in Germany. Henderson, the Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office responsible for German affairs, will accompany him. During his stay in Germany, Prime Minister Attlee will stay at the residence of British Military Governor Robertson. According to the planned itinerary, Prime Minister Attlee will stay in Berlin from Friday midnight to Sunday morning, and will go to other parts of the British zone to inspect from Sunday morning. It is reported that Attlee's last trip to Berlin was in July 1945, when he attended the Potsdam Conference as the leader of the opposition party, accompanying Churchill.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Germans close to the Soviet military government revealed that the news of British Prime Minister Attlee's scheduled visit to Germany surprised the Soviet military government. Semanov, the political adviser of Soviet Military Governor Sokolovsky, immediately went to Sokolovsky's residence in Potsdam for a long secret talk after receiving the news.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Has 100,000 Troops Stationed in Austria, Hungary, and Romania</h3>

<h3>Clay Proposes Restoring the German Shipbuilding Industry</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] News from here: The United States and Britain will soon hold negotiations to decide whether to allow Germany to build ships that sail the ocean. Clay, the U.S. Military Governor in Germany, recently proposed restoring the German shipbuilding industry and merchant fleet. It is said that Clay specifically advocated allowing Germany to build several 10,000-ton freighters and one 35,000-ton passenger ship. The U.S. Navy Department supports Clay's proposal, but other parties strongly oppose it. Clay's proposal is tantamount to setting aside the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement prohibiting Germany from building ocean-going ships. Officials here also gradually believe that this ban will eventually be relaxed to allow Germany to build ships that sail the coast and canals.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Plans to Create a Ruble Currency Zone: A Large Amount of Gold Reserves as Collateral</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] It is rumored here that the Soviet government intends to give the ruble international value and will create a ruble currency zone. Within this zone, exchange rates will be completely free. The value of the ruble exchange will be guaranteed by a large amount of gold accumulated by the Soviet Union over the past 30 years. This reserve has been increasing as a result of the Soviet Union's development of gold mines, totaling 3 billion U.S. dollars, some say 6 billion U.S. dollars, 100 million U.S. dollars, or even more than that. It is reported that the United States, excluding the Soviet Union, accounts for 85% of the world's total gold reserves, amounting to approximately 22 billion U.S. dollars, while the gold pound zone has only 2 billion U.S. dollars.</p>

<h3>Draft North Atlantic Security Treaty: Negotiations Among Seven Countries Progress Smoothly; Most Parties Oppose Inviting Italy to Participate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Washington, 2nd Broadcast: Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference that the countries preparing to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty are currently discussing whether to invite Italy and other countries to join. Acheson also said that he hopes this matter can be decided soon. The countries currently discussing the treaty include the United States, Canada, and the five countries of the Western European Union. It is said that during the meeting of the seven countries on the 1st, there seemed to be a tendency to exclude Mediterranean countries from the treaty.</p>
<p>However, Acheson said that there were no major disputes among the countries over the wording of the treaty, and said that the meeting was proceeding smoothly in a harmonious atmosphere. Acheson also said that the government plans to provide foreign countries with military supplies and has begun drafting a plan by the State Department.

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Representatives from seven countries met at the U.S. State Department today to prepare the final draft of the North Atlantic Treaty. It is rumored that the treaty can be drafted tonight, but it has not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Treaty Adds Clauses to Prevent Communist Forces from Infiltrating</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Authoritative sources here: In addition to stipulating the provision of assistance to Western European countries to resist any external aggression, the North Atlantic Treaty will also stipulate the provision of assistance to Western European countries to resist internal aggression. From this perspective, the North Atlantic Treaty is nothing more than a blueprint for the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance in the Western Hemisphere. The Western Hemisphere Treaty clearly stipulates that the advisory body established under this treaty may consider appropriate collective measures in the event of a dangerous threat, and this clause has also been included in the North Atlantic Treaty. It is reported that officials drafting the bill of the treaty have realized that the United States should not only supply Western Europe with the materials necessary to resist armed attacks, but also assist Western Europe in resisting the infiltration of communist forces. When Truman first launched the aid plan for Greece and Turkey, this principle had already been established.</p>
<h3>U.S. Army Authorities Reveal That U.S. Troops Stationed in Japan Will Be Increased: The Number Will Increase to 100,000 Starting This July</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Washington, 2nd Broadcast. U.S. Army authorities revealed that the total number of U.S. troops stationed in Japan will not only not decrease, but will also increase by 12,000. According to the spokesman, starting from the 1950 fiscal year (starting on July 1st of this year), the total number of U.S. troops stationed in Japan can reach between 95,000 and 100,000, while at the end of 1948 it was only about 75,000 to 80,000. Recently, the military department announced at a press conference that the U.S. military authorities in the Far East had requested that the number of troops stationed be increased to 127,000. The military department spokesman also said: The U.S. Department of Defense has informed the British Commonwealth countries of the defense areas of the U.S. troops stationed in the Far East in the next year. MacArthur has four complete combat divisions, which proves the absurdity of the previous rumors that the U.S. troops stationed in Japan would be reduced.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Resolution to Abolish Racial Restrictions in Immigration Law</h3>

<h3>If an Agreement Cannot Be Reached with Indonesia, the Netherlands Will Withdraw from the Western European Union: The Mediation Committee Accuses the Netherlands of Disregarding the Security Council's Resolution</h3>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 1st] A Dutch spokesman hinted today that the Netherlands may withdraw from the Western European Five-Nation Economic Alliance. It is said that the solution to the Indonesian question is linked to the Netherlands' participation in the Western European Alliance. The success or failure of the Netherlands' agreement on the establishment of Indonesia will determine whether it is an important member of the Western European Alliance.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 2nd] The United Nations Mediation Committee submitted a report to the Security Council today, stating that the Dutch government's proposal to hold a round table conference between Indonesia and the Netherlands in The Hague still acted on its own accord and disregarded the Security Council's resolution of January 28th. The Security Council resolution demanded the release of the Indonesian Republic leaders, the restoration of the Indonesian Republic, the supervision of the Indonesian Federal Council elections, and the transfer of all sovereignty to the Indonesian Federation before July 1, 1950. The Netherlands has not yet accepted it. The report also stated that no agreement has been reached on the establishment of a federal provisional government. Neither Indonesia nor the Netherlands has conducted negotiations in accordance with the Security Council resolution. Two months after the Security Council ordered a ceasefire, the war in Indonesia has not stopped and is expanding. The fundamental factor in the Indonesian political deadlock is that the Dutch government does not allow the Indonesian Republic government to resume exercising its functions in Yogyakarta.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the Army Reportedly to Retire in May: Voorhees to Be Responsible for Managing Occupation Affairs</h3>

<h3>General MacArthur Sues British Newspaper Reporter: Soviet Union Could Attack Japan, America Determined to Help Japan, But Does Not Believe the Soviets Have the Power to Invade Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] General MacArthur told Mr. Brace, a reporter for the London Daily Mail, on the 1st: "If the Soviet Union attacks Japan, we are determined to defend it." But he continued: "I do not believe the Soviet Union will attack Japan." During the meeting at General MacArthur's headquarters, he frankly discussed Japan's position in the British and American strategy in the Pacific. He said: "If there is another major war, we do not want Japan to fight." MacArthur explained: "Japan's position is like Switzerland in the Pacific." The reporter asked: "What if Japan is attacked?" MacArthur said: "Well, we will certainly defend her." But he continued: "I don't believe the Soviet Union will attack Japan. Even if the Soviet government has the belief to invade Japan, it cannot be realized unless it has air supremacy and the Soviet Far East Fleet or a way to eliminate the American fleet." He said: "The Soviet Union cannot gain air supremacy. At the end of the war, the United States built twenty-five airfields on Okinawa, which can send out a maximum of 3,500 B-29 bombers every day. The entire East Asia, from Singapore to Vladivostok, is within the range of these aircraft." When asked about Japan's role in defense strategy, MacArthur replied: "We have always regarded Japan as an ally. We hope it will remain neutral, and we will help it become self-sufficient, so that we can reduce the burden of supplying it. I believe that in three or four years, Japan can be self-sufficient in food through domestic production or exchange exports for imported food."</p>
<p>American Strategy Entirely Changed by War</p>
<p>Although the Communist Party recently won in China, MacArthur believes that the interests of Britain and the United States in the Pacific are completely safe, and he is not worried about the Japanese Communist Party gaining votes in the general election. He said: "I don't think the Japanese Communist Party has any connection with Moscow." But he said: "American strategy has been completely changed by the war. Our defense preparations are based on the mainland, believing that the Pacific is the road for a possible enemy to attack. Now the Pacific has become an Anglo lake. Our route passes through a series of islands to the Asian coast. This line starts from the Philippines, passes through the Ryukyu Islands, including the main fortress of Okinawa, and then passes through Japan and the Aleutian Islands to Alaska. Although the victory of the Communist army in China has made them on the side of this position, it has not changed the fact that our possible enemy on the Asian continent does not have a nearby industrial base to supply amphibious attacks." MacArthur said: "The Soviet Union's war industry is in the Ural Mountains. Their mass-produced weapons and ammunition must rely on a 4,000-mile railway line to be transported to Vladivostok."</p>
<p>The Time is Not Yet Ripe for Establishing a Japanese Defense Force</p>
<p>When asked about the proposal that Japan should be "allowed" to establish a defense force, MacArthur replied: "This is a premature proposal. This is a question that can only be decided when drafting a peace treaty with Japan. Before the peace treaty is signed, the occupying forces will remain in Japan. This is not to suppress Japan—this is unnecessary—but because of the unfortunate division between the Allied powers during the war, we should give priority to defense of British and American interests." MacArthur said: "If Japan is attacked, recruiting troops to 'cooperate with us' is extremely easy." He pointed out that "the Japanese are the most stubborn infantry in the world." When the reporter mentioned that the Soviet Union once said that the Japanese police are the core of the future army, MacArthur did not agree. He said: "There are now 125,000 people, and their task is to maintain domestic order, and less than 20% of them carry pistols."</p>
<p>Although the Communist Party recently increased from four seats to 35 seats out of the 466 seats in the Japanese parliament, MacArthur does not believe that communism is a danger to Japan. He said: "This proportion may represent their actual strength. I do not believe that the Japanese Communist Party has a direct relationship with Moscow. Communism will not expand in this country where 48% are small farmers. The land reform that transfers the land of landlords to tenant farmers allows more people to have a stake in the country. I don’t think communism is more terrible in Japan than in Britain or the United States. MacArthur believes that the Japanese are deeply grateful for the new social concepts and the greater freedom given to them by the Allied occupation. He said: "Japanese workers have been cruelly exploited. Their wages are so low that they can barely make a living. We have allowed Japanese workers to form trade unions, eight-hour workdays, collective bargaining rights, and other benefits. I fully expect that a Labour Party can be established in Japan."</p>
<p>MacArthur's Impression Reminds People of Foch</p>
<p>Although the reporter has experience interviewing the most luxurious figures in the world, few conversations have made such a deep impression as MacArthur's. He used very fluent and good words to talk about everything from the strategy of the last war in Europe to the US government's policy towards China. MacArthur's fluency reminded the reporter of Foch and Chiang Kai-shek. His ability to explain complex problems is admirable. MacArthur wore a US military battle uniform, with five silver stars in a circle on each epaulet. His office is on the top floor of a building supported by marble pillars, formerly the office of an insurance company, facing the Japanese Imperial Palace. If MacArthur's father had been born a few months earlier, the 69-year-old MacArthur could claim British nationality. He said: "My grandfather was a Scotsman who lived in Glasgow. He went to the United States in 1842 at the age of thirty. My father was born soon after, and I grew up in the tradition of the MacArthur clan. I have never been to Scotland, but if the holiday is long enough, I will definitely go." MacArthur expressed the warmest feelings for the British and Australians. He served as commander-in-chief in Australia during the war. He said: "From the Prime Minister to the soldiers, I could not have more loyal support than they gave me." MacArthur's most admired person is Churchill. He corresponded with Churchill when he was the commander in Australia during the war. The reporter asked: "The Soviet Union has repeatedly interfered with the Allied occupying forces in Germany. Why don't you have any trouble with the Soviet Union?" MacArthur replied: "Perhaps because the Soviet Union's Oriental intelligence is the same as in the era of Genghis Khan, and I have many years of experience dealing with the Orient."</p>
<p>The Publication of the Interview Caused Another Controversy</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] A spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters press office said on the 2nd that MacArthur had not authorized London Daily Mail reporter Brace to publish an interview based on their conversation. The spokesman said that MacArthur had never given a declarative interview and has always forbidden it, only using it for background reference, not for publication. He said that Brace either misunderstood or violated his covenant.</p>
<p>But Brace claimed that before he met with MacArthur, MacArthur and Allied headquarters personnel never told him that the interview could not be published. Brace said that he had specifically asked Colonel Iglehart, the chief of the press department of MacArthur's headquarters, to find a way for him to "meet" with MacArthur, and then he achieved the purpose of meeting with MacArthur for about an hour on Monday.</p>

<h3>The Body in the Box was Transported from its Original Location to the Shanghai North Railway Station, Attracting Thousands of Spectators; a Suspicious Person on the Train was Detained in Kunshan; the Body was Sent to the Coroner's Office, and the Prosecutor's Office will Conduct an Examination Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The train box murder case, as a result of the efforts of the two railway police departments, has detained a suspect. It happened that the plainclothes detective, who was monitoring the corpse box on the 74th train the day before yesterday afternoon, discovered a suspicious person at Kunshan Station. After following and secretly monitoring him for a while, he was directly detained for interrogation. The corpse box was transported back to this city by the original train from Changzhou at 11:55 yesterday morning and sent to the coroner's office on Changde Road. The prosecutor's office has scheduled to send a prosecutor to examine the corpse at ten o'clock this morning. The police authorities hope that the family members of the victim will read the newspaper, discover it as soon as possible, come to Shanghai to identify the body, and provide clues to facilitate the investigation and solving of the case.</p>
<p>After the "body in the box" was discovered on the 74th train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at 3:40 the day before yesterday afternoon, the railway police department immediately mobilized all plainclothes police officers to secretly deploy a detection network at each station on the two lines. The two leather boxes were still placed on the train as they were, and five detectives disguised as passengers secretly guarded them. The 74th train departed at 4:30 pm on the same day and arrived in Changzhou at 9 pm. The passengers in the car did not know that there were foreign objects hidden in these two leather boxes. After arriving at Changzhou Station, no one took these two boxes. There was no disturbance overnight at Changzhou Station, so when the train returned to Shanghai (73rd train) from Changzhou yesterday morning at 6 o'clock, the "body in the box" was still brought back by the original train. However, the plainclothes detective on the 74th train had noticed a suspicious person when the train departed from Shanghai North Station, because the corpse box was placed on the second third-class passenger car, which was originally converted from a fourth-class car. The equipment was relatively simple and close to the locomotive, with a lot of smoke and ash. Under normal circumstances, people would not enter this car until the passenger cars in the later sections were full. At that time, there was a man who sat in the second car after arriving at the platform. At that time, there were still few passengers in the other carriages, and the man frequently stared at the two boxes on the way, and constantly looked around at the passengers. His actions and demeanor were very unnatural. The train arrived at Kunshan and got off the train. Two detectives immediately followed and monitored him. Until the evening, because his suspicion was high, he was detained for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Deceased was Tall and Robust in Life, with Traces of Ropes Remaining on the Ankles</h3>
<p>The 73rd train carrying the "body in the box" arrived at North Shanghai Station at noon yesterday. Director Jin, who was handling the case, ordered two porters to move the box to the open space behind the third and fourth-class waiting rooms for detailed research. It was found that a corner of the remaining seal was left on one box, and the word "×" could be vaguely distinguished. In addition to the cotton batting and white cloth used to cover the corpse blocks in the box, an old black woolen women's coat, a yellow army blanket, and half a newspaper (possibly the Southeast Daily published in Hangzhou) were also found. Judging from the corpse blocks, the deceased must have been a strong, tall and robust person during his lifetime. There was a deep knife mark on the upper left eye of the head, and there were still traces of rope tied on the ankles. After the corpse was dismembered, it must have been carefully scrubbed and wiped, so the corpse blocks were unusually clean. Director Jin said that before the prosecutor's examination, it was inconvenient to move too much, so at 2:10 pm, it was still loaded in the original box in its original state and sent to the coroner's office by truck.</p>
<p>Traffic Congestion at North Railway Station</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when the truck drove to the iron gate connecting the North Railway Station building and the square, a large number of curious citizens suddenly crowded in, surrounding the truck and scrambling to see the "body in the box". Although the escorting railway police tried to dissuade them, it was ineffective, and more and more people gathered, more than 10,000 people. The entrance gate of the North Railway Station was also blocked by the crowd, and cars and three-wheeled vehicles could not enter the station. The order was very chaotic for a while. According to personnel at the station, after residents nearby read the newspaper yesterday morning and learned about the strange case on the train, they came to the station in groups to inquire about the "body in the box". When the "body in the box" arrived in Shanghai at noon, it was very secretive, and the outside world rarely knew about it. It was not noticed until it was loaded on the truck and prepared to be sent to the coroner's office. This kind of news</p>

<h3>Two Major Demands and Seven Proposals Approved by Acting President Li in Reply Telegram</h3>
<p>Representatives of more than 30 units of provincial and municipal councils and national vocational groups convened the "National Peace Promotion Association" in this city from the 10th of last month. After three days of discussion, they put forward two major demands and seven proposals related to promoting comprehensive peace, and telegraphed the government and the Chinese Communist Party authorities for adoption. The association received a reply telegram from Acting President Li yesterday, believing that the above suggestions are indeed the goal sought by the government and the people, and have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for reference and adoption. The original telegram is as follows: "To Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce, and to the Presidium of the National Peace Promotion Association: I have read the Chouchou telegram. Your loyal words and correct arguments are admirable. The two major demands are indeed the key points that those who sincerely seek peace must fulfill, and the seven proposals are also the goals sought by the government and the people. In addition to submitting them to the Executive Yuan for reference and adoption, I specially reply. Li Zongren."</p>
<p>The fastest spread of information attracted so many spectators in a short period of time, even blocking traffic at the North Railway Station for more than 20 minutes, which was unexpected by the police authorities.</p>
<h3>A Series of Questions Worth Considering</h3>
<p>In addition to fully investigating the murderer, the railway police authorities have also assigned several detectives and criminology experts to deduce the entire case based on the existing evidence. It is reported that they speculated from the corpse and the yellow army blanket in the box that the deceased may have been a soldier. As for which station the "body in the box" boarded the train, why it had to be transported to Changzhou, whether transporting it to Changzhou was a smokescreen, where the person who transported the "body in the box" to Shanghai is currently hiding, whether he is the murderer, what is the relationship between the women's coat in the corpse box, how to use the "×" on the remaining seal of the corpse box... a series of questions are very thought-provoking and waiting to be answered.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Wang Zongqing's Death Sentence for Inciting Labor Strikes on Two Railways are Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] It was rumored that Wang Zongqing, Wang Daguang and more than a dozen others who were suspected of inciting labor strikes on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways last time have been arrested and tried by the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters. Wang Zongqing was sentenced to death, and the others were sentenced to imprisonment. It was said that Wang Zongqing had been escorted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Military Law Office for scheduled execution. The reporter visited Sun Chongxia, director of the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters, yesterday, who said that he had not heard of this matter so far. The reporter also inquired about the Shanghai Command Post of the Garrison Headquarters, but was unable to confirm it. However, the authorities have always tried to keep the disposal of important prisoners a secret in advance. It is said that Garrison Commander Chen Daqing ordered his subordinates to investigate the source of the news because the above news was published in yesterday's evening newspaper.</p>
<h3>Curfew Shortened, Night Market Reappears Vigorously, Dance Halls and Restaurants Extend Business Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After the curfew time was shortened by one hour, the nightlife in Shanghai has reappeared vigorously. After learning the news the night before, dance halls, cafes, and tea houses have automatically extended their business hours to 11:00 pm.

<h3>Strongly Invite Doctors to Make House Calls, Thugs Lurk Outside the Lane: Li Ming's Clinic is in Trouble</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At around 10:00 yesterday morning, a woman named Yang Yueying, a neighbor of Dr. Li Ming living at No. 25, Lane 672, Changle Road, went to the Jing'an Temple Police Branch to report that: At around 12:00 noon the day before yesterday, two strangers visited Dr. Li seeking medical treatment and insisted on entering. Yang strictly refused them entry because Dr. Li Ming was having a dispute with Zhang Xueqin and feared that there would be an accident. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 yesterday morning, the people who came the day before yesterday accompanied another man and again invited Dr. Li to make a house call, saying that the patient had a poor appetite and was bedridden. Seeing their fierce appearance, she still refused, saying that Dr. Li had returned to Wuxi. Unexpectedly, they retreated to the back door to wait. It happened that a three-story cohabitant opened the back door without knowing what was going on, and they took the opportunity to rush in and insisted on inviting Dr. Li to make a house call. Mrs. Shu, a neighbor, negotiated with them, but they were unreasonable. When Mrs. Chen stepped forward to hold them, one of the men broke her fingernail and bled. After receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Branch sent personnel to rush to the scene and take the above two people to the station for interrogation. According to their confession: One named Wu Xin and the other named Yang Laoba were instructed by Zhang Jinlong of the Meili Car Company to invite Dr. Li to make a house call, and they knew nothing else. Later, the police station summoned Zhang Jinlong but failed to do so. More than ten minutes later, the branch received a call from residents of the lane, saying that there were 30 to 40 thugs lurking at the entrance of the lane, intending to do something. Yan, the deputy branch director, and Yu, the section chief, personally led a large number of police officers in police vehicles to rush to the scene to round them up, but they had all dispersed. Section Chief Yu detained the suspects for seven days in accordance with the Violation of Police Law as a warning. According to the previous dispute between Zhang and Li, Zhang was released on bail by the Meili Car Company. Whether there is any other inside story in this case is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Forging Bank Drafts: Suspects A and B Apprehended One After Another</h3>

<h3>The Atmosphere at Jiaotong University is Lively with Firecrackers and Drums; Student Union Election Competition is Intense</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The campus of Jiaotong University in Xujiahui has been immersed in a fierce election atmosphere these past few days, all for the seventh student union election since the restoration. This semester, the election method has changed from individual candidates to class-based competition. Ten classes are to be selected from the 83 classes in the entire university to carry out the work of the various departments of the student union. As a result, enthusiastic election campaigns have unfolded among the various classes. Upon entering the school gate, everywhere from classrooms to dining halls to dormitories, one can see propaganda slogans of all sizes and colors plastered on the walls. Large election banners hang from the trees along the walkways, campaign manifestos are broadcast over the loudspeakers, and even the ground is covered with artistic election lettering. The campaign methods of each class are varied and unique. In addition to the common set of tactics, there are even entertaining programs such as showing movies and enjoying record music. The sources of campaign funds for each class also vary, ranging from voluntary donations from students, contributions from department associations, or equal sharing among the students of the class, with the first two methods being the most common.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 12:30 noon, all the classes jointly held a large election parade on campus. Everyone was scheming and showing off their abilities. The procession included foreign music bands, large gongs and drums, decorated cars, costumed performances, and various propaganda banners and slogans. The bright banner of Jiaotong University led the procession of five or six hundred people through all parts of the campus. The sounds of gongs and drums, firecrackers, songs, dances, and slogans intertwined to create a lively scene, as each class asked students to vote for them. Professors, police, and students crowded along both sides of the walkways, and as the procession passed, bursts of laughter, cheers, and applause erupted. The students had obtained permission from the university for a full public holiday for the first class in the afternoon for the election parade. At 6 p.m. in the evening, an election evening party was held at the school gymnasium, where each class gave a brief election speech and performed specially choreographed election songs and dances.</p>
<p>The propaganda slogan of the sophomore class of the Department of Hydraulic Engineering said, "Hydraulic Engineering II are oxen, not scalpers." And their election slogans included, "Scowling coldly at corrupt officials, we hate their lies during elections. Willing to be oxen for our classmates, we pledge to be loyal and consistent after being elected." and "The north wind kills early, jackals quickly die and get out, stop lingering and misleading the people. Spring is gradually thickening, water buffaloes diligently plow and plant, all hard work is for the masses." The meanings are all very profound.</p>
<p>The election propaganda of the past few days has already drawn the atmosphere inside Jiaotong University into a heated state. Today, ballot papers are distributed, and voting begins. Eighty ballot boxes have been set up throughout the university. Which ten classes will be victorious will be known when the ballots are counted next Monday.</p>
<h3>Investigation by the Supervisory Committee on the Matter of Top Housing by Directors of the China Textile Company Completed; Liu Weichi's Use of Public Funds Was "Public Funds for Public Purposes" and There Was No Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Special Report] After an investigation by the Supervisory Committee Branch Office for the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region regarding the matter of top housing by the newly appointed directors of China Textile Company, such as Deng Gongxuan, the responsibilities have been largely determined. According to the investigation, Chen Qitian, the former executive director of China Textile Company, still occupies the China Textile Company's director's guest house, and all of Chen's belongings are supplied by the company. His wife even stated to the outside world that Chen needed to stay there for recuperation due to illness, but it is true that Chen's occupation of the premises led to the top housing of the new directors. Secondly, the process of Director Sun Jiuku's top housing was entirely handled by the company, and Sun went to live there. Since Sun's wife personally went to the top housing and did not handle any funds, Sun has no responsibility. It is said that the process of Deng's top housing was not handled personally either, while Secretary Guo Ying personally received the funds and handled the matter herself, which is obviously inappropriate. However, Liu Weichi was not involved in this matter. The investigation by the Supervisory Committee Branch Office is complete, and the report will be released soon. Secondly, regarding the matter of Liu Weichi's use of 18 million yuan of public funds, the investigation by the Branch Office concluded that it was "public funds for public purposes" and that the funds had been returned in a short period of time, so Liu himself bears no responsibility.</p>
<h3>Research Institutes of Academia Sinica in Beijing and Shanghai Temporarily Not Considering Relocation to Taiwan; Facing Financial Difficulties and Eagerly Hoping for Solutions</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The National Academia Sinica has thirteen research institutes, including History and Language, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Geology, Zoology, Botany, Chemistry, Psychology, Medicine, Engineering, Astronomy, Meteorology, and Physics. Currently, except for the History and Language and Mathematics Institutes, which have been moved to Taiwan, and the Social Sciences and Geology Institutes, which remain in Beijing, the remaining nine institutes are all concentrated in Shanghai. Previously, when the situation was tense, the authorities planned to move all the research institutes in Beijing and Shanghai to Taiwan. The researchers in the institutes felt that a long-distance relocation would cause damage to equipment, dispersal of personnel, and cessation of work, so most did not agree. Now that the situation has temporarily stabilized, the talk of relocation has ceased.</p>
<p>Like other government academic institutions and schools, the most serious problem for Academia Sinica is funding. The Legislative Yuan has not yet approved this year's budget. Apart from public expenses, the Ministry of Education has only allocated funds to each institute twice so far this year. The first time was 5,000 yuan per institute, and the second time was 50,000 yuan. This amount of funding is far from the actual expenses, so most institutes rely on overdrafts to maintain operations. Recently, the Ministry of Education sent a telegram from Guangzhou stating that a total of 5 million yuan could be remitted to the research institutes in Beijing, Shanghai, and Taiwan, but the public expenses budget for the Shanghai institutes alone, including water, electricity, gas, and telephone, requires 8 million yuan for March alone. Previously, the personnel in Shanghai had resolved to send representatives to Beijing to petition for increased funding. Later, because President Zhu Jiahua returned to Shanghai from Guangzhou, he went to Beijing to discuss solutions with relevant parties.</p>
<p>The Academia Sinica currently has over a hundred researchers and associate researchers. Their salaries are calculated according to a standard of 75 times, averaging about 15,000 yuan per month, excluding board and lodging within the institute. Under these difficult circumstances, they still do not give up the research work they have been immersed in for many years, hoping to achieve something. In terms of research equipment, there is still a shortage of equipment. In previous years, foreign exchange was requested to order and replenish equipment from abroad, but there has been no foreign exchange in the past year.</p>
<h3>Scholarships for Poor Students Expected to Reach 40 Million</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The scholarship fund for poor students in this city, after the Bureau of Education requested radio stations and the entertainment industry to raise funds through the airwaves, has raised more than 14 million yuan. However, half of this amount has not yet been received. The Bureau of Education is urging the Boy Scouts to actively collect the funds, with a deadline of the 5th to collect all of them. Other items donated by various sectors of society will be sold at a charity sale, which is expected to raise more than 5 million yuan. Mayor Wu has promised to donate 10 million yuan in the name of the municipal government, and Mayor Wu and Director Li will also solicit 10 million yuan from the National Bank, bringing the total amount to 40 million yuan. This scholarship fund will be distributed according to the student enrollment ratios reported by each school.</p>
<h3>Stranded Students in Yantai are Ill and Urgently Awaiting Relief</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The Shandong Qingdao stranded students who previously came to Shanghai and stayed at the Shandong Provincial Association on Zizhong Road in this city, including more than 200 students from Jinan United Middle School and more than 70 students from Qingdao Middle School, have recently left Shanghai in batches and have all departed as of yesterday. It is reported that the Jinan students went to Hangzhou and then to Jiangxi, and the Qingdao students went to Changsha and Hengyang in Hunan. Currently, there are still 20 students from Yantai Guohua Middle School, including Qiu Shuji, and two students from Yiwen Middle School, including Zhang Jiuke, recuperating in the Shandong Provincial Association. According to Qiu, Zhang, and others, more than 2,000 students from eight middle schools in Yantai fled to Shanghai in November of last year. Later, they all went to Lantian in Hunan, where they established the main school and the first branch of the United Middle School in Lantian, and the second and third branches in Qiaotou City and Sanjia, a few miles away from Lantian. Qiu and the other 22 students suffered from acclimatization, diarrhea, fever, blisters on their bodies, and weak limbs, so they had no choice but to return to Shanghai in December of last year. Currently, seven of them are still ill and have not recovered. Because they have nowhere to seek help, in addition to pawning their clothes and belongings, they can only eat a subsidized bowl of congee at the Pulv Society on Changle Road in this city every day, and there is no other way. Their situation is very pitiful, and it is hoped that the authorities in charge of youth guidance and relief in the Ministry of Education will find a way to provide them with relief.</p>
<h3>More Than Half of the Students at Shanghai Textile College are Receiving Reduced or Waived Tuition; President Zhou Raises Funds Everywhere to Support</h3>
<p>The Private Shanghai Textile Industrial College has dedicated professors and excellent results. Most of the graduates of each class are introduced to jobs by the school. Although the school is in a very difficult situation, it did not increase tuition fees last semester, and senior students continued to attend classes during the winter vacation. Although tuition and miscellaneous fees this semester are calculated based on the price of rice, the price per stone is only 4,100 yuan. Students receiving reduced or waived tuition account for 70% of the entire school, so the tuition fees collected in one semester are far from sufficient to cover expenses. President Zhou Chengyou raises funds from textile factories to make up for the shortfall.</p>
<h3>Yuyou Volunteer School Established</h3>
<p>The Yuyou Volunteer Tutoring School, sponsored by the Yuyou Friendship Association of the St. John's Alumni Association, has been established.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sends Ships to Continue Searching for Floating Corpses from the Jiangya</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is still continuing to salvage the bodies of the victims of the Jiangya ferry disaster. The Huazi No. 208 landing craft was dispatched again, carrying representatives from various hometown associations and 30 empty coffins. Yesterday morning, they left port to search for floating corpses in the waters off eastern Zhejiang, and sailed to Huanglong and Sijiao to investigate. The coffins were brought to be used to collect and bury the bodies whenever they are found.</p>
<h3>Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs States that the Cost-of-Living Index Wage System Remains Unchanged; Industries Related to People's Livelihood Will Still Be Regulated; Hairdressing Prices Will Use the Cost-of-Living Index Calculation</h3>
<p>[Special Report] Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Cao Peizi, the director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, to inquire about the possibility of employees demanding that their salaries be calculated in customs gold units, following the recent decision by public utilities to calculate prices in customs gold units. According to Cao, the cost-of-living index wage system is very scientific, and before a more perfect method is found, any request for change will not be considered. When asked about rumors of loans from the National Bank to support private factories, Cao said that there were many difficulties with this matter and it had not yet been considered. As far as he knows, there will be no problems with raw materials for each factory in March. The requests from the owners of small factories to stop work have been rejected. As for the recent rise in prices, those closely related to the public's livelihood will still be regulated. For example, the recent price increase in the hairdressing industry is too high and unreasonable. The prices have been divided into several levels based on pre-war prices, with each level having a base number, which is multiplied by the monthly published cost-of-living index to arrive at the new hairdressing price. This method has been submitted to the municipal government for review, and if it is approved at the municipal meeting, industries such as bathhouses and hotels may follow this principle.</p>
<h3>The Scalpers are Growing in Strength, Their Livelihood is Both Bitter and Sweet; The Foundation of Their Transactions is Built on the Vast Salaried Class</h3>
<p>[Special Report] In recent years, there has been a noteworthy phenomenon in Shanghai: the increasing strength of silver dollar scalpers. In the gaps between the ever-changing economic policies of the authorities, this group, known as "silver dollar scalpers," has expanded from their base in the Old North Gate to Henan Road, Xinghualou, the racecourse, Jing'an Temple, Xujiahui, Tongfu Road, and Avenue Joffre, almost distributing themselves throughout all the important areas of Shanghai. The silver dollar, which had been absent for fourteen years, has unexpectedly made a comeback, and the rise and fall of the value of the gold yuan tells every citizen directly and deeply through the "silver dollar scalpers."</p>
<p>Although the ranks of the "silver dollar scalpers" are growing, their initial appearance was extremely accidental. Long before the decisive battle in the Yellow River flooded area in the Central Plains, the Communist-controlled areas, in order to fully absorb materials from the government-controlled areas, encouraged the people to enter and exit Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Hunan in "single-gang" style, purchasing in small quantities. Because they stipulated a relatively high discount on silver dollars, silver dollars became one of the purchasing targets. At that time, the areas near Wuhan, Sanxiang, Bangbu, and Wu, which were close to the war zone, saw silver dollars being absorbed in large quantities at high prices. How could Shanghai speculators not know? They immediately gathered floating capital, secretly established shops, and contacted areas up the Yangtze River. Under their coordination and call, a small number of "silver dollar scalpers" began to appear in the Old North Gate area. However, their initial appearance was inevitably masked, and the transactions were not very lively.</p>
<p>Open-Air Markets Distributed in Various Districts</p>
<p>It wasn't until the price controls were lifted on August 19 of last year that black market prices for silver dollars soared in Hunan and Hubei. At this time, the flames of war were raging everywhere, and the actual transactions between the Communist and Nationalist areas decreased, but the transactions between Shanghai and Hankou increased. The Hankou gang, Changsha gang, Subei gang, Anhui gang, and countless "single-gangs" all came to Shanghai to seek silver dollars. Therefore, the "silver dollar scalpers'" open-air markets opened for business, occupying land on various roads, and gradually taking shape.</p>
<p>In just over a month, the golden age for the "silver dollar scalpers," which emphasized light profits, quickly disappeared. Provinces and cities in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River began to exert political pressure, causing silver dollar black market prices to plummet. The number of out-of-town customers decreased. The "silver dollar scalpers'" business scope had to shrink to simply maintaining the difference between buying and selling. But what is puzzling is that the number of people "employed" by them has been increasing. Their targets naturally cannot be limited to two types of people: those who intend to save, or those who are waiting for urgent use. Because the buying and selling procedures are convenient, and the amount is not as large as gold, especially because its transaction foundation can be built on the vast salaried class, shop employees, and even rickshaw pullers, maids, etc., it is quite able to maintain a "prosperous livelihood" situation. When business is busiest, the exchange of silver and banknotes is done under the sleeves, without even taking the time to carefully examine "clipped coins" or "dull coins."</p>
<p>External Disturbances Occur Frequently</p>
<p>Having broken away from the support of speculators and going to "fight alone," the "silver dollar scalpers" can be said to have both bitter and sweet experiences in business. External disturbances and police raids can occur at any time. Once, a "silver dollar scalper" received a customer who looked like a soldier, wanting to sell. The price was settled, and the "silver dollar scalper" was counting the banknotes one stack at a time. While counting, the "customer" suddenly disappeared. The "silver dollar scalper" quickly grabbed a uniformed officer from the crowd and asked, "Officer, where's the money?" This "officer" was not easy to mess with. He rolled his eyes and said in a Shanghai accent, "What money?" But usually, things are relatively calm because the connections between them form a price, so there is no need to pay special attention to the influence of the situation or have a clear understanding. Of course, they are not absolutely loyal to the market or customers. Once, a "silver dollar scalper" raised the selling price by two grades. After a customer bought three silver dollars and discovered that he had been cheated, he went to argue. The "silver dollar scalper" simply ignored him. As a result, the customer had no choice but to complain to the police. Who knew that the police officer would answer irrelevantly and ask him a question: "Do you know what this scalper's surname is?"</p>
<p>Specialize in Buying Miscellaneous Silver Dollars at Low Prices</p>
<p>Why is it that the transaction price of silver dollars has always been led by the "Yuan Head" and has remained strong for so long? The "silver dollar scalpers" themselves do not know the reason. In theory, the silver content of the "Yuan Head" is only 90%, so the price should not be higher than the "Eagle Dollar" and "Dragon Dollar," which have silver contents of 92% to 95%. In rural areas around Jiangnan, it has recently been informally stipulated that eight silver dollars can be exchanged for one stone of rice, and the silver dollar must be the "Eagle Dollar." This is because they traditionally believe in the fineness of the "Eagle Dollar." Shanghai rice merchants who go to Songjiang and Jiaxing to purchase rice have also searched for "Eagle Dollars" on the market at one time. However, the price of the "Eagle Dollar" has never exceeded the "Yuan Head." According to the "silver dollar scalpers," some people specialize in buying miscellaneous silver dollars such as the "Small Head," "Sichuan Dollar," and "Hong Kong Silver Dollar" at low prices, because they have illusions that silver dollars will be used at the same price after the announcement of the financial reform plan.</p>

<h3>Spring River Waters Warm, Talking About "Crossing the River"</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Li Tian</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Yongkou by this Newspaper, 1st] Based on intelligence obtained by the military from various sources, and reports I have come into contact with from people of all walks of life in Jiangbei, regarding the recent situation in Jiangbei after "liberation," the following conclusion can be summarized: Although south of the Yangtze River, especially in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, the sound of peace talks is deafening, here, neither the sound of peace can be heard, nor can any atmosphere of peace be seen. What is heard and seen here is only "speedily and vigorously completing all preparations for crossing the river," "fighting to Nanjing, capturing alive ×××," and "responding to the call of superiors and carrying out the revolution to the end."</p>
<p>Originally From Yongcheng Eastward</p>
<p>Since the end of the Qinglongji battle, after the Nationalist army's Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps, following Huang Baitao, Huang Wei, and Sun Yuanliang's three corps, were "eaten," Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng have, in the past fifty days, reportedly completed their replenishment at an astonishing speed. Among these, excluding Liu Bocheng's main force which had already been transferred back to Dabie Mountain and the Central Plains Military Region, Chen Yi's troops, which had only fifteen field army columns during the Jinan campaign in September of last year, have, in the past five months, not only replenished their original losses, but have also expanded to twenty-five columns, totaling more than 500,000 men. Of these twenty-five columns, except for eight columns stationed in Shandong and the Xuhai area of northern Jiangsu, the remaining seventeen columns are all stationed between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, including three columns, the 10th, 11th, and 12th, along the Grand Canal line in northern Jiangsu between Huaiyin and Yangzhou; the Yangtze River Column in the Nantong-Jingjiang area; five columns, the 2nd, 3rd, 9th, Bohai, and Rapid columns, on both sides of the Tianyang Highway in the Tianchang and southwest Gaoyou Lake area; four columns, the 1st, 4th, New 8th, and Liangguang, in the Mingguang-Chuxian-Quanjiao area of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway; three columns, the 6th, New 5th, and New 6th, and the 37th Army, reorganized from Wu Huawen's unit which "took righteousness" in Jinan, in Hefei and its vicinity on the Huainan Railway; the 7th Column and the 35th Army near Chaoxian; and another 25,000 men with numbers yet to be investigated stationed in the Kongjiaqiao and Sima Town area near the port. The total strength of the above seventeen columns, two armies, plus the local Communists, should be more than 400,000 men. Their command system is as follows: in the area of the Grand Canal and its surrounding regions, it is the responsibility of Chen Yi's deputy Su Yu; in the area of the southern section of Jinpu and its surrounding regions, it is the responsibility of Xu Shiyou, commander of the Shandong Corps of the East China Field Army, with Chen Yi overseeing the whole.</p>
<p>In the past week, the main force of the Communist army on the Grand Canal line has all gathered in the Yangzhou, Xiannvmiao, Yiling, and Simaqiao area. The Communist army near Tianchang has also moved towards the Tianyang Highway and Liuhe. The Communist army on the Jinpu front has also been transferred south one after another. According to the military's judgment, the Communist army seems to be attempting to occupy the Jiangbei bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army with an absolute superiority in forces, attempting to invade Bawu south of Jingjiang, Kou'an south of Taixian, Shijiaqiao, Shierwu, Liuwu, Guazhou, Yizheng, and the Dahekou southwest of Yangzhou, Liangpu area south of the Hehe River, Jiangpu, Niaojiang, and Yuxikou of the southern section of Jinpu. (The Anqing and western bridgehead positions are not included.)</p>
<p>Is the Communist army's attack on the Jiangbei bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army a</p>
<p>full-scale offensive? Or is it a series of individual attacks? In the near future, the Communist army will answer us with facts. But one point that can be pointed out here is that capturing the Jiangbei bridgehead is an important item in the "preparations for crossing the river." Therefore, before the Communist army launches the offensive to cross the river, it must first occupy the entire, or at least the majority, of the Jiangbei bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army, because these bridgehead positions are also the connecting points of important rivers and the Yangtze River, or at least they are ports on the north bank of the Yangtze River that can accommodate larger ships. If the Communist army does not occupy these important ports in advance, the large number of warships it has built in the Grand Canal, Hongze, Gaoyou, Yingtong, and various lakes will have no appropriate outlet. If these many bridgehead positions are not occupied, its coastal highway will not be able to be built smoothly. If the coastal highway cannot be completed, it will be a major difficulty for the movement of its troops, especially the deployment of heavy artillery units, because its heavy weapons cannot be used flexibly to cover its river-crossing troops and inflict effective damage on the Nationalist navy. Therefore, we may as well explain in more detail here that the Communist army's preparations for crossing the river, in addition to the necessary capture of most of the Jiangbei bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army, should include: (1) completing the coastal highway, or even two or more highways, both parallel and inner and outer lines; (2) completing the Jinpu Railway: At present, the Jinpu Railway is still operating in sections. The Nationalist army removed two sections of the Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge north of Jinan last autumn, and the materials are still stored in Jinan. The Communist army is planning to repair it. The railway south of Xuzhou only reaches Guzhen. The large railway bridge over the Huai River north of Bengbu is being actively repaired after being destroyed. In addition, three or four smaller bridges south of Bengbu are also under construction. If the railway is not repaired, the large number of Japanese, American, and German heavy weapons captured by the Communist army in the Northeast will not be able to be transported to the Jiangbei coast; (3) building a large number of ferries: It is reported that Chen Yi plans to build 10,000 various types of ferries, of which, in addition to a few rubber boats with motors and civilian ships that were captured on various battlefields, most need to be built temporarily; (4) water warfare training: The past "human wave tactics" are truly "useless for heroes" on the water! Everything from swimming, steering, rowing, how to "land in front of the enemy"? How to occupy "beachhead positions" are all new topics and all need to be learned from scratch.</p>
<p>Although Ye Jianying is "bragging" to the Nanjing</p>
<p>peace delegation, saying that "the Communist army can cross the river at any time"; although Chen Yi also claims that "wasn't it me who led troops across the river after the "Southern Anhui Incident" during the Anti-Japanese War? At that time, the Japanese navy and air force were better than today's Nationalist army, and now the strength of the Communist army is incomparable to that of the "Southern Anhui Incident"?" But before these many military and technical problems are properly resolved, such as small-scale, piecemeal sneak crossings, to enhance the strength of the local Communists in Jiangnan, so that they can accumulate little by little when necessary, and preemptively occupy some Jiangnan bridgehead, and then respond to and welcome the main force of the Jiangbei Communist army crossing the river, of course, it is possible. But if you want to talk about "crossing the river in a big way" at the moment, it is naturally "too early to say." Moreover, all levels of cadres in the Chinese Communist Party unanimously believe that the Bible, that is, Mao Zedong's book "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," repeatedly tells them, "Do not fight unprepared battles, do not fight battles that are not sure of victory!" Chen Yi and his subordinates will certainly not act rashly before completing sufficient preparations. Therefore, the conclusion here is: it is very likely that the Communist army will launch an attack to capture the Jiangbei bridgehead positions of the Nationalist army within this month. If we talk about the main force crossing the river, it will definitely have to wait until April or May of this year, after the spring river waters have warmed and the preparations for crossing the river have been completed. At that time, the "peace talk" game should naturally have yielded results. If the Chinese Communist Party believes that the "conditions are satisfactory," it may as well implement "political crossing of the river" first. Otherwise, if it believes that it is "not satisfactory enough," what follows is naturally another main force decisive battle launched by Liu Bocheng, Lin Biao (recently reported: one column of Lin Biao's troops has already gone south along the Pinghan Railway and crossed the Yellow River), Chen Geng, etc. towards Central China, and coordinated with this offensive of the Communist army, Chen Yi's troops will, under the response of the local Communists in Jiangnan, launch a large-scale crossing of the river at several points!</p>

<h3>Strict Discipline of Soldiers in Chongming: Soap in Exchange for Stamps, Postal Workers Show Sympathy and Prefer to Give It Away</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Chongming, 10th of this newspaper] According to reliable sources: Commander-in-Chief Gui is preparing to make Chongming one of the naval bases. After Xiao's troops are set up, it will be gradually implemented. There is a saying passed down among the people of Chongming: "When the world is in chaos, Chongming is a good place to hide from disaster!" The current situation is very different. Unless peace is achieved, I am afraid it will be difficult to do so.</p>
<p>The discipline of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in Chongming is strict and they do not commit the slightest offense. Their treatment is extremely low, but they are content with it and never overstep the bounds due to poverty. Once, a reporter met a soldier at a stamp agency to mail a letter. He did not have any money with him, so he took out a cake of government-issued soap that had just been used to pay for the postage. When the agency saw this, they expressed great sympathy and were willing to give it away, returning the soap to him. He was so grateful that tears streamed down his face, and he thanked them repeatedly. Two or three days later, he returned the postage perfectly. From this, we can see how strict their discipline is.

<h3>Two Monks in Yixing Died Miserably and Strangely: Clues to the Murderer Have Been Found</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Yixing, 28th of this newspaper] Futian Nunnery in Fangzhuang Township, Xushe District, under the jurisdiction of the county, is isolated on the bank of a bridge east of the village, about half a mile from the village. It has only twelve mu of temple land, which is enough to support the life of one monk, presided over by the monk Yuekun. Yuekun discussed with the local area to help repair the temple, which had been in disrepair for many years. Construction began last spring and it returned to its former appearance. Zen Buddhist monk Jing, the director of the Buddhist Association of Jiangsu Province, recently came to Yixing from Zhenjiang and stayed at the nunnery. Yuekun treated him like a guest, regarding it as a glory for Buddhism. At 9:00 a.m. on February 25, a daughter-in-law of Li Haofa from Xibutou village in the village went to burn incense. The mountain gate was ajar, so she pushed it open and entered. She called for the monk but could not find him, so she lit the fire herself. After finishing the worship, she glimpsed a hole dug in the east wall of the nunnery. When villagers such as Li Xingjiu heard the news, they became curious and asked a companion to enter the nunnery to investigate. Soon they went straight into Yuekun's bedroom and approached the cloud bed. They suddenly saw Yuekun dead in a pool of blood. They took a fire and saw two knife wounds on his head, which were chopped by a kitchen knife. Li Xingjiu and others immediately left the nunnery and walked to the riverbank in front of the nunnery. They saw the body of the monk Jingchan thrown in the river, with injuries all over his body, apparently caused by wooden sticks. As for the cause of death of the two monks, everyone had different opinions for a while. According to the clue of the murderer, it has been found from the hemp rope with which the monk Jingguan was tied, and it is now being hunted down.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from this newspaper] Huangtiangang is tentatively opening the Jiangjing ferry. The ferry bureau has been closed for a long time and has requested the authorities to resume navigation. Except for the bridgeheads that are blocked, other ports in Jiangbei have applied for navigation.</p>
<h3>Bird's-Eye View of Zhumadian</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Xinyang, 26th of this newspaper] Six hours before the special car of the press corps moved north (3:00 a.m.), Pengjiawan Station, 13 kilometers away from Xinyang, was suddenly looted by more than 20 bandits. Even the shoes on the stationmaster's feet were snatched away. When the news came, the atmosphere at Xinyang Station was particularly tense, but our "Paire" was not discouraged at all. After waiting for the report from the armored car on its patrol, it finally departed on time. Commander Li Benyi, out of concern for the safety of the reporters, specifically instructed the assault troops escorting the car to set up machine guns behind the two motorcycles at the front and rear of the car. Fu Guang, the deputy chief of staff of the military headquarters who accompanied the group, also held an American submachine gun and jumped into the car.</p>
<p>The Central Plains Is in Turmoil, Bandits Rise</p>
<p>Leaving Xinyang and heading north, we are heading into another realm. The impression on both sides of the railway is a picture intertwined with the scenery of desolation, desolation, eeriness, and tension. From the Huaihe Bridge, Changtaiguan, Minggang, Queshan, to Zhumadian, on both sides of the railway belonging to Xinyang and Queshan counties, we only saw three thin plows, more than ten villages burned by starvation, many new graves, and the suffering people who boiled wild grass and black noodles into a pot of soup, which looked like coriander was added to oxtail soup, and they ate it with relish. It is extremely lucky to eat a little black noodles. Otherwise, you have to become a robber and steal to eat. In the eleven years of war, on the land south of the Great River, according to official estimates, it is impossible to estimate how many of the 32.84 million people have been killed and starved to death. At least 30,000 to 40,000 people are still starving to death. Now, the Central Plains is in turmoil and bandits are rising. Who should be held responsible for this? Those who have died and are waiting to die obviously have not figured it out yet. So, the strong take the risk, and the weaker ones take the opportunity to imitate the early practices of the local Communists, holding guns and dominating a village, making pitiful eyes at both sides, and waiting to see what happens. This phenomenon is really no different from a new "copy" of the turbulent era of the Yellow Turban Rebellion in the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>Yun Chang Is Stationed, the County Magistrate Bears the Burden</p>
<p>The light car, in the posture of a knight, crossed the Huaihe Bridge and swept past Minggang, as fast as a galloping horse. The carriage swayed like a cradle, but none of us complained of dizziness. When the car stopped at Queshan, Tu Jingtang, the current brigade commander of the 3rd Security Brigade and the magistrate of Queshan, who came from a middle school principal and led students to fight guerrillas, from southern Henan and northern Huai to northern Jiangsu, and has never been defeated, also jumped into the car and accompanied us north. Among the local armed forces, this brigade is Zhang Zhen's trump card, because the combat power and discipline of Tu's troops are all satisfactory, so they are placed on the front line of the Pinghan Front and bear the important task of defending Queshan and Zhumadian. Now that Zhang's corps has added strong troops to defend here, it shows that Zhumadian, where Guan Yunchang was once stationed, is even stronger and more solid. The car passed Queshan and arrived at Zhumadian, the forefront of southern Henan, in 40 minutes. The platform was already full of representatives from all walks of life welcoming the press corps. After we got out of the car and greeted Deputy Brigade Commander Sun, Regiment Commander Lai of the garrison, and the local gentry, we were invited to walk to the Catholic Church to rest. Along the way, we saw a post every five steps and a sentry every ten steps. Moreover, every cross street and intersection was guarded by sentries. The thoroughness of the protection and the severity of the atmosphere were unprecedented.</p>
<p>Dangerous Zone, Cold Guns Fired</p>
<p>According to Deputy Brigade Commander Sun, Zhumadian Tuzhai is about ten li in circumference, and the population inside the stockade is about 50,000. About 20,000 passengers pass through it every day. There are as many as 50 large and small institutions, and there are two administrative inspectors' offices and 19 exiled county governments, including Suiping, Runan, and Biyang. In addition to the garrison and local teams of various counties, the total number is actually 100,000. This Muir town is only seven li away from the front-line trenches at the closest point. When we arrived, the trenches not far from the railway station on both sides of the railway were already full of combat soldiers wearing steel helmets. They had to guard against attacks at all times and also had to constantly guard against the at least hundreds of plainclothes local Communists lurking in the stockade. The task was very arduous, so they specifically divided the entire stockade into five alert zones. The area from the station to Changshou Street at the Catholic Church was the most dangerous zone. Cold guns were fired from time to time. The complicated situation was far more than Jieshou during the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Second Day Town, Mobile Market</p>
<p>We rested for a while at Tiansheng Hall. At the reception, after listening to Deputy Brigade Commander Sun and President Wang of the Chamber of Commerce report on the local situation, we took advantage of the group meal to freely interview and visit the city within and outside the stockade. This is the second largest town in southern Henan on the Pinghan Line, 56 kilometers away from Luohe, the largest town, only 45 li north of Suiping County, 70 li east of Zhengyang, about 110 li southwest of Biyang, 45 li south of Queshan, 65 li southeast of Runan, 100 li northeast of Shangcha, and 140 li northwest of Wuyang. It is the lowest basin in southern Henan. During the rainy season, the water inside the stockade can be knee-deep. There are no rivers. Residents use well water, but the sewers on both sides of the street are very well made and the city is quite clean. The vendors all over the street illustrate the mobility of this market. The stationmaster of the railway often works on the train. It has become a habit for the locomotive to turn around immediately after arriving at the station. Commerce is dominated by miscellaneous grains, cotton, yarn, cloth, tobacco, paper, sugar, salt, oil, and pork.</p>
<p>Between Luo and Zhu, the Number of Business Vehicles Decreased Sharply</p>
<p>Now that the Communist army is pressing in, there is not much tobacco and cotton coming from the north and paper and cloth coming from the south. The number of business vehicles traveling between Luo and Zhu has also decreased from more than 100 per day to 20 or 30. The unified collection office, which includes twelve kinds of donations and taxes, has greatly reduced its tax revenue. Information personnel and counterintelligence activities from both sides, who are active in various forms on this candle head, have never stopped. The guys who make a fortune by smuggling contraband have come and gone again. It is really an adventurer's paradise. Material exchange stations and information exchanges are only miserable for the local poor who are struggling to survive under the scarcity of food and firewood. They are almost awakened every night by the hateful gunshots.</p>

<h3>After Free Trading of Gold and Silver Is Restored, National Banks Are Able to Stabilize the Market: Finance Minister Xu Said at the Reception for Reporters That National Banks Have a Set of Measures to Stabilize the Market</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from this newspaper] Finance Minister Xu Kan and National Bank President Liu Gongyun emphasized at the press conference yesterday that the government must have the power to stabilize the current volatile market. Liu said: National banks have many ways to tighten credit. After the new plan is announced this time, the tools for National banks to sell have increased to five types: cotton yarn, sugar, state-owned enterprise stocks, foreign exchange transfer certificates, and gold and silver. National banks will sell any kind of materials at any time depending on actual needs. The purpose of selling is to absorb gold yuan, not to suppress prices. Although the number of issuances is kept confidential, according to the current U.S. dollar exchange rate, less than 20 million U.S. dollars can recover all the gold yuan that have been issued. As for how to stabilize various markets, National banks now has a set of measures under discussion. Xu also repeatedly stated that after free trading of gold and silver is restored, National banks will definitely have the power to stabilize the market. If National banks had not successively sold materials in the past few months, I am afraid that the market prices of various commodities would be more than they are today.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) After Finance Minister Xu Kan flew to this city, he immediately met with Central Bank President Liu Gongyun and Bureau Director Lin Chongyong at the Bank of China that night to review the financial and price situation in this city after the announcement of the new financial plan.

<h3>Commodity Prices Are Rising Again, and Gold Notes Are in Good Demand</h3>
<p>On the second day of the issuance of large banknotes, commodity prices rose again. Because funds from various places came again, the tight credit situation eased slightly, and the secret interest rate was 70 to 75 yuan. After public utilities were valued in Guan Yuan, the rise was alarming. Tax collection was changed to the payment of real objects, and production costs doubled. Gold notes outside the market were in good demand. Gold (9) unit price (thousand yuan)</p>
<p>Morning open 157 160</p>
<p>Morning high 162 164</p>
<p>Lowest 154 156</p>

<p>Afternoon closing 3670 3720</p>
<p>Yesterday, the afternoon closing price of gold notes was 20% higher than the morning, and all transactions were for overnight settlements. However, due to excessively high asking prices, there was much speculation, and trading was not smooth.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's US dollar listing was 2,800 yuan, 150 yuan higher than the previous day. Foreign exchange transfer certificates opened at 2,900 yuan in the morning. The Central Bank still released them, as low as 2,850 yuan, and then raised them to 2,960 yuan.

<h3>A Positive Outlook Across the Board Boosts the Shanghai Stock Market</h3>
<p>The trend in Chinese stocks is one of comprehensive strength, with the market showing a momentum of direct upward movement. This is largely due to the reform of public utility prices, which are now calculated on a basic unit of currency, boosting confidence within the industry and creating extreme enthusiasm. Furthermore, the salaries distributed across various industries are flowing back into the market, so while credit remains tight, the shortage of cash is not as severe as it was yesterday. As a result, bullish investors are actively buying, and the market is soaring. At the opening of the Chinese stock market, Taiwan Sugar once again reached its ninth consecutive limit, trading at 25,930 yuan. Following closely behind were Yongye, New Asia, Hengfeng, Commercial Press, and Great China Match, each also reaching their respective daily limits. Yongsha opened at 3.61 yuan, with securities firms eagerly bidding up the price, leading to consistently high market momentum. At one point, it approached the daily limit, trading at 3.85 yuan (3.86 yuan being the daily limit price). However, due to the continued tightness of credit, individual investors were unable to bear the heavy burden and turned from buyers to sellers, causing the market to decline, reaching a low of 3.51 yuan. Near the close, news spread that the listed price of US dollars had been raised to 2,950 yuan, reigniting investor confidence and driving the price up to close at 3.76 yuan. The American-Asiatic Company also reached its daily limit. Other stocks reaching their limits included China-Feng, Sino-Russian, Zhabei, Jingfu, Rongfeng, New Light, and Franco-Chinese, totaling seven.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Soar</h3>
<p>The trend in foreign stocks is one of comprehensive price increases. In the Green sector, this is mainly due to the easing of credit yesterday, leading short sellers to become long buyers. Ewo Yarns traded at 7,400 yuan and 7,600 yuan, a significant increase of over 1,000 yuan from the previous day. Jardine Matheson also jumped by 1,000 yuan, trading high at 7,700 yuan. Wheelock Marden saw robust buying interest, driving the market price consistently higher, reaching a high of 22,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan from the previous day. All other stocks also reported increases ranging from 20% to 30%.</p>
<h3>Salt Industry Production Loans: Four Measures Approved by the Rediscount Committee</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee has approved the following four measures regarding salt industry production loans for the 38th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1949] for various regions: (1) Salt industry production loans for the 38th year are approved based on the distribution plan proposed by the Salt Administration for seven regions (Taiwan, Guangdong-Guangxi, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan-Kangding, Northern Sichuan, and Yunnan), with a total loan amount limited to 845 million yuan. (2) Once this plan is approved, these seven regions will not be allowed to request additional loans during this year. (3) These loans will be distributed by the five banks—Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Industrial and Commercial Bank—in proportions of 35%, 30%, 15%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. The Bank of China will serve as the lead bank. The loan term is three months, with a monthly interest rate of 3.6%, and the loans may be rediscounted with this bank at 90% of their face value, with the rediscount interest rate calculated by deducting 0.3% from the original lending rate. (4) The distribution of these loans should be handled fairly and transparently by a distribution supervision committee jointly formed by the local branch of this bank, the relevant salt administration authority, the relevant bureaus, and representatives from salt producer and merchant associations in each region, to ensure proper disbursement.</p>
<h3>US Aid Cotton to Be Exchanged for Yarn; Consolidated Tax to Be Borne by the Committee</h3>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth Reaching New Highs; Sentiment Unanimously Bullish Due to Price Fluctuations in Goods Outside the Industry</h3>
<p>Due to fluctuations in prices of goods outside the cotton yarn industry, holders are in high spirits, with little intention of selling at low prices. As a result, the market is booming, with average prices for various yarns jumping by about 20%.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened at a high of 1.06 million yuan and closed even higher at 1.09 million yuan, a surge of 190,000 yuan. Other brands such as Bao Guang and Jincheng also opened above the 1 million yuan mark.</p>
<p>40-count Blue Phoenix initially traded at 950,000 yuan, but due to strong demand from the local market, it surged to close at 1.02 million yuan, an increase of 130,000 yuan.</p>
<p>32-count Silver Moon closed strong at 820,000 yuan, also up by 130,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods rose by 85,000 yuan, closing at 655,000 yuan. Factory orders closed at 615,000 yuan and were offered at 650,000 yuan for delivery the following day.</p>
<p>20-count Double Horse opened at 570,000 yuan in the morning and finally settled above the 600,000 yuan mark at noon. Other brands such as Jincheng and Tiannv also opened around 600,000 yuan. Prices for all other yarns reached unprecedented highs.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth prices rose again yesterday, with the market opening strong in the morning. This was due to a slight easing of tight credit within the industry, leading to renewed market optimism and active buying. There was also healthy retail demand from the Nanjing and Hangzhou areas.</p>
<p>Leading fine cloth started at 24,600 yuan and rose to 25,600 yuan. Subsequently, as some investors sold off their positions to realize profits, the market gradually eased, closing at 25,300 yuan at noon, a sharp increase of 3,300 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, buying interest from outside the market grew even stronger, and prices were bid up to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Si Junzi Yuan Bi Ji fluctuated from a high of 23,000 yuan down to a low of 22,850 yuan, before rising again to 24,000 yuan near noon, closing at 23,900 yuan, also up by 3,300 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to rise to 28,700 yuan.</p>
<p>La Ba Tong fine cloth surged by 3,200 yuan, closing at 23,500 yuan. Jin Lian Miao Wu finally rose by 2,500 yuan. Factory prices for other colored and patterned cloths increased by about 30%.</p>

<h3>Silk Soars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market continued its strong upward trend, with prices improving rapidly. Credit in the market went from loose to tight, and interest rates went from low to high, with prices rising across the board at noon.</p>
<p>120-count Tianqiao opened at 820,000 yuan with supply available. Some small investors, recognizing the tight credit and rising interest rates, sold off inventory to lend out money. Initially, there was ample supply on the market, and the market appeared weak. Later, it was rumored that additional capital from other regions had arrived, and financial goods had been suppressed for days, causing capital to flow outward. After 11:00 AM, buying surged, and the market became very active, closing high at 880,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, credit eased, and banknotes rose after falling. Prices of goods outside the industry were all high, so bullish investors moved forward boldly, and the market rose again, hovering near the 1 million yuan mark before settling back down to 960,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the raw silk market saw a relatively stable trend in foreign exchange certificates, and participants initially took a wait-and-see approach, with little market movement. Later, news that prices of goods outside the industry were rising across the board also drove the market upward. Superior grade spot goods first traded at 950,000 yuan, with strong local demand. Prices gradually rose, fluctuating around 1 million yuan. The upward trend did not weaken, and prices continued to rise after reaching a high, ultimately closing at 1.03 million yuan at noon.</p>
<p>Prices for silk fabrics also rose as raw material prices soared, boosting sentiment. Credit in the industry eased slightly, but interest rates remained high. Holders held on tightly, and prices ultimately surged. American-Asiatic opened at 560,000 yuan and briefly rose to 570,000 yuan. Later, news that gold prices were rising again caused the market to shift, and credit tightened after initially easing. Bullish investors took advantage of the high prices to sell, causing the market to fall back to 550,000 yuan. The market then rebounded and prices rose again, fluctuating around 560,000 yuan. Near noon, all goods saw good momentum, and sentiment was strong, with prices rising from 560,000 yuan to close at 568,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Notes</h3>
<p>The Onlooker:</p>
<p>As America Opens Gold Prices, the US Dollar May Jump by 50%</p>
<p>Regarding the opening up of gold and silver trading, the Ministry of Finance has already approved the establishment of public gold and silver markets in Guangzhou and Shanghai. The Shanghai Gold Exchange is unwilling to bear the risk of paying the resumption fee and would rather transfer its site rights to the Securities Exchange, with the old brokers following.</p>
<p>Of course, the urgent need to list and auction gold price bonds and the realization of a gold and silver market are both imminent.</p>
<p>International gold and silver trading has also begun to shift from control towards openness. Even in the United States, there are proposals to restore a free world gold market.</p>
<p>Recently, the New York Daily Tribune also published an article advocating the establishment of a free gold market. The gist of it is that US production has not yet become excessive, and the world's demand for US goods is increasing, so the United States can abandon its official gold price of US$35 per ounce. As a result of the world's need for US dollars, the price of pure gold may fall to US$20 per ounce.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to saying that the world's gold price may fall by 40% to 50% against the US dollar. That is, the US dollar will then rise sharply by 40% to 50% against the price of gold.</p>
<p>However, the United States is the big boss of the International Monetary Fund, and the international standard currency is denominated in US dollars. If the United States really abandons the official gold price, although a large rise in the value of the US dollar against the world's gold prices is certainly possible, a disturbance in the international foreign exchange market order is also highly likely.</p>
<p>When the market opened this morning, credit was very tight, but it eased significantly in the afternoon, with banks making public, large-scale disbursements.</p>
<p>The stock market is the most sensitive. After opening, it rose sharply despite the still-tight credit, followed by numerous limit-ups. This also greatly changed the situation in the commodity market. The excitement was even greater in the afternoon.</p>
<p>According to the recent movements of general speculative capital, it pulled up stocks in the morning and gold banknotes and silver dollars in the afternoon. Yesterday, the price of gold was reported to be 180,000 yuan, the US dollar rose to 3,600-3,700 yuan, and silver dollars also reached 2,300-2,400 yuan. As a result, the Western medicine market, which is most closely related to foreign exchange, also saw great activity. For example, the popular drug Vogan jumped from 850 yuan to 1,400 yuan. It can be said that this was the commodity with the biggest price increase in the market yesterday.</p>
<p>As Banks Disbursed Funds, Gold, Silver, Stocks, and Banknotes All Rose Together</p>
<h3>Credit Tightness Eases Slightly; Rice Prices Rise Again; Flour Prices Soar; Oil Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Rice prices are rising. As the tightness of credit eases slightly, sentiment becomes more optimistic, and owners raise prices. Prices opened 500-600 yuan higher in the morning, and prices continued to rise as demand remained strong. North Market White Geng rose by 900 yuan, trading at 16,900 yuan. Thin-husked rice rose by 1,100 yuan, with special Geng rice trading at a high of 18,500 yuan. Shade-dried white rice rose by 700-800 yuan. In the South Market, white Geng rice was at 16,500 yuan, thin-husked rice and early rice rose by 800-1,000 yuan, special Geng rice was at 17,000 yuan, and Xian rice trading was very sparse. A total of 5,591 shi of rice arrived at the North and South markets yesterday.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Soaring fiercely. As the market opened, credit eased and buying interest from the North increased, leading to price increases for all goods. Lao Che flour traded at 7,950 yuan yesterday, briefly touching the 8,000 yuan mark. Bing Chuan flour jumped above the 7,000 yuan mark at the opening, reaching a high of 7,500 yuan. In the Central Market, as prices of other goods weakened, owners were wary of holding high positions and sold off a lot of inventory, causing the market to decline at one point. However, as actual sales remained strong, prices rose again at the close, trading at 7,450 yuan. Bran rose by 10%, with Da Bao Fuxin trading at 6,150 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Rising across the board. Soybean prices increased by 10% across the board. Che Dou briefly reached 17,000 yuan before falling by 1,000 yuan at the close due to the weakening oilseed cake market. Sentiment softened. Zha Dou rose sharply by 2,000 yuan, trading at 14,000 yuan today. Shelled peanuts sold well, rising by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Yangzhou Ti Zhuang surged past the 40,000 yuan mark. Sesame prices have risen too much in recent days. White sesame has become stable, while yellow sesame has risen rapidly by 10%. Red sorghum increased by 1,000 yuan across the board, and corn saw a slight increase.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The market is rising. As credit has eased slightly, people are bullish. Prices in the morning increased by 4,000-5,000 yuan, and after briefly weakening in the Central Market, prices rose again at the close. Soybean oil was at 68,000 yuan, having fallen to 66,000 yuan in the Central Market before recovering to 68,000 yuan at the close. Rapeseed oil closed at 66,000 yuan, each rising by 5,000 yuan. Jiangbei Ji Tong raw oil opened at 76,000 yuan, and small cart sesame oil all rose by 6,000-7,000 yuan. Oilseed cake buyers from other regions did not accept the prices. Miscellaneous brand oilseed cakes rose by 400-500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wholesale Prices for Ginseng and Bird's Nest Rise</h3>
<p>The ginseng and bird's nest market saw sluggish retail sales, but wholesale sales improved slightly. 60-branch Western ginseng was priced at 160,000 yuan, 80-branch at 140,000 yuan, and 100-branch at 120,000 yuan. Wild top-grade ginseng was at 64,000 yuan, and cultivated top-grade ginseng was at 50,000 yuan. Prices for white fungus and bird's nest varied, but they were rising due to the off-season. However, there was no demand.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Listed Prices Determined</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] At yesterday's China Trust Bureau artificial silk meeting, it was decided that the listed prices for artificial silk for the ninth period of this year (February 28th to March 5th) would be 707,000 yuan per case for Italian 120-count third-grade bright silk.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Surges</h3>
<p>Tung oil soared yesterday. As gold and goods aligned with the surge in prices for goods outside the industry, and with prices of public utilities rising across the board, sentiment soared despite tight credit. Buying interest was sky-high, and sellers were adamant. The upward trend continued to grow, with the market constantly moving towards new peaks. By the close, prices for various brands had surged by 3,000-7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medium-Thick Serge Sells Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend for medium-thick dark serge was upwards, and retail prices rose again. Yihwo 55 and Shanghai Double Cat serge were wholesaled at 12,000 yuan in the market, while 39 was at 10,000 yuan, 5009 was at 8,000 yuan, and mainland products were priced at 9,000 yuan. Merchants from Nanjing and Hangzhou were eager to buy, leading to strong sales. The game of speculative trading has therefore started again. Another reason for the strong sales is that there are many orders for Zhongshan suits and student uniforms.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trends Upwards</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market continued to show its brilliance. Due to the tight credit situation, industry players faced heavy pressure. However, tea stocks were depleted, and apart from limited arrivals from various parts of Zhejiang, other areas such as Wutun had become choked off. Furthermore, stimulated by the soaring prices of everything, holders continued to struggle, unwilling to let go at low prices, and the market trended upwards. However, transactions were limited due to buyers' difficulty in absorbing the high prices, with only sporadic trading.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Taiwan sugar market rose before falling. Initially, due to the influx of outside capital, buying interest was strong, and sentiment was quite bullish. Later, as credit eased before tightening again, sentiment weakened slightly, and prices gradually fell. However, prices were still up significantly at noon.</p>
<p>No. 45 Che Bai Jing initially traded at 315,000 yuan, and coarse sand also reached 307,000 yuan. Prices rose and fell in the middle, ultimately hovering at high levels. Subsequently, as merchants from other regions sold more than they bought, closing out positions one after another, prices fell sharply. No. 4 1/2 closed at 310,000 yuan at noon, and coarse sand closed at 303,000 yuan at noon, each rising by 1,600 yuan. Other types of sugar, such as white, red, and refined, all rose by about 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>City Industrial Association's Import and Export Research Committee Discusses Import Quotas; Advocates Banning Imports of Goods with Sufficient Domestic Production</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Import and Export Research Committee of the City Industrial Association held its second meeting on the 2nd. More than ten people, including Liu Hongsheng, attended. Two resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the two types of goods recently prohibited or temporarily suspended from import by the Export Control Committee, it is hoped that the Industrial Association's Technical Committee will provide key information. Given the time constraints, it should be based on the principle of protecting domestic production. Consult the previous data from the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office and the Technical Committee, providing references from a neutral standpoint. However, it should be revised at any time depending on domestic production conditions. Resolution: Passed. (2) Regarding the government's recently announced financial and economic reform plan, the third item on import and export trade maintains the quota system for tobacco and petroleum. Regarding the categories of goods prohibited and temporarily suspended from import, due to their impact on the survival of domestic industries, it was resolved that luxury goods and those with sufficient domestic production should be prohibited from import. Goods for which domestic production is currently insufficient should still be temporarily suspended from import. It was also recommended that additional categories be added to the list of restricted imports, making appropriate decisions based on domestic production needs. Resolution: Passed.</p>

<h3>World Boxing Champion "Brown Bomber" Joe Louis Retires; Earned Nearly $4 Million from Boxing Matches in Twelve Years</h3>
<p>"I am happy to retire. Retirement relieves me of a heavy burden. I feel I am no longer able to fight. Rather than lose the title in the ring, it is better to retire voluntarily."</p>
<p>[Wire Service Report] Miami, Florida, 1st - Brown Bomber Joe Louis officially announced his retirement today, and the world heavyweight boxing throne, which Joe Louis has occupied for twelve years, has been vacant from today.</p>
<p>Louis' retirement does not mean that he is cutting himself off from the boxing world. He has applied to the National Boxing Association to host a new championship final between Walcott, whom he has defeated twice, and famous boxer Charles. The match will be held in Chicago in June and is scheduled for fifteen rounds.</p>
<p>Louis and Walcott, Norris organize the International Boxing Association, with offices in New York and Chicago. The Walcott-Charles showdown will be hosted by this newly established organization. Louis said that both Walcott and Charles have signed contracts agreeing to compete and that both have agreed to accept the challenge of Saward or Lisnerovich within ninety days of the new champion's emergence.</p>
<p>Louis' retirement application was sent to the National Boxing Association by his secretary, Mengdaoer. After review, it was announced by Green, the person in charge. Green also said that the association has thoroughly reviewed Louis' plan to host a championship to determine the new champion and "will provide assistance." He also said: "The Walcott-Charles final is not a guaranteed seat. The winner of the match must sign a contract guaranteeing Saward or Lisnerovich the opportunity to challenge the title holder in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Louis' retirement has saddened Joe Koerner, the person in charge of the 20th Century Sporting Association, which has always been in charge of hosting the Boxing Championship. Koerner had originally planned to arrange a grand championship for Louis this summer. This sudden news forced Koerner to abandon all plans. He even declared: "I will have to retire with Louis."</p>
<p>After retirement, Louis still plans to travel to Central and South America for exhibition matches.</p>
<p>Joe Louis is 34 years old this year and has held the title of boxing champion for eleven years, eight months and seven days since June 22, 1937, when he knocked down Brad Dock in Chicago. He is the first person in boxing history to do so.</p>
<p>Louis is also the youngest boxing champion. He was only 23 years old when he first won the crown. Louis came from humble beginnings, born in a wooden shed in Alabama on May 13, 1914.</p>
<p>Louis' first professional boxing match in 1934 earned him only $50. Since then, he has had smooth sailing. As of this year, his income from boxing matches, according to "The Ring" magazine, has reached $3,887,323.</p>
<p>Also, Joe Louis announced tonight that he believes the Chicago Stadium venue for the Walcott-Charles fight is too small, so "no formal decision has yet been made as to where it will be held."</p>
<p>[United Press International, Miami, Florida, 1st] World heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis formally wrote to the National Boxing Commission today, declaring his voluntary retirement and requesting permission to create an International Boxing Federation to host boxing matches. The Boxing Commission has granted his request.</p>
<p>Joe Louis has maintained an unbeaten record since ascending to the throne in 1937. His resolute retirement to fulfill his long-cherished ambition has made fans sad.</p>
<p>According to Joe, "I am happy to retire. Retirement relieves me of a heavy burden. I feel I am no longer able to fight. Rather than lose the title in the ring, it is better to retire voluntarily."</p>
<h3>Crowds in the Bahamas Greet the Boxing King</h3>

The enthusiasm was even greater than when the Duke of Windsor arrived here in 1940 to take office as Governor of the Bahamas.</p>

<p>Maclean's offensive was fierce last night. Hai Ching made one free throw at the beginning of the game, and Maclean immediately took the lead.

Continuing the battle after the break, Hai Ching's two dark-skinned players were full of energy. The two sides tied five times. After 30 points each, Maclean unleashed its power.

<h3>HONG KONG SILVER SHIELD SOCCER: KIT CHEE DEFEATS POLICE, WILL FACE SOUTH CHINA IN THE FINAL</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Aviation News] In the Hong Kong Special Silver Shield soccer semi-finals, after South China defeated St. Joseph's 1-0 last Saturday, Kit Chee also defeated the Police 2-1 the next day. Now, the two teams, South China and Kit Chee, will compete for the championship.</p>
<p>The 90-minute match between Kit Chee and the Police was nerve-wracking. Every minute was like a wild storm, with the Police's goal area in chaos more than a dozen times. Zhao Fu, Zhang Songgen, and Huang Jingcong from Kit Chee had to leave the field due to injuries, and several players from both sides received warnings, which shows how tense and exciting the game was.</p>
<p>Kit Chee's victory over the Police was due to the united efforts of the entire team and their high morale. Each player moved forward bravely and showed no fear of the field. Kit Chee's center-back, You Huaxing, played the best, keeping Hou Lu and Gordon under control and not giving them an inch. The forwards cooperated effectively. "Crazy Horse" Zhao Fu played with some brains, and Ya Qi and Songgen did their duty as forwards. Yao Zhuoran has made great progress, and his dribbling and shooting skills are good. Given time, this young man has a great future. Jingcong, as the left-winger, was also able to coordinate with the center. The entire forward line was able to maintain a cohesive flow from beginning to end. It was truly remarkable to achieve victory in such a difficult and challenging match.</p>

(7) If there is a shortfall in the competition expenses, each team will be responsible for raising the funds. (8) Before the start of the game, both sides must fill out the starting lineup form, add the jersey numbers, and submit it to the referee for verification.</p>
<h3>FRIENDLY SOCCER MATCH: RAILWAY TIES BRITISH NAVY 1-1</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In a Sino-British friendly soccer match between the Railway team and the British Navy, held at Yiyuan yesterday at 4:00 PM. The British sailors were from the HMS London team. Both sides agreed to use British soccer rules, with no substitutions allowed and a limit of eleven players per team. Railway player Xiao Ziwen was late, and ultimately could not play. The British army launched fierce offensive, scoring a goal in the first half. The Railway team did not score until the last ten minutes, when Wu Binghao carried the ball into the net, leveling the score, ending the game in a 1-1 draw. The Railway team was spared the humiliation of defeat. In the second half, British center-back Bo Peiqi was injured in the eye by the ball, leaving them with only ten players to fight to the end. Only about a thousand spectators attended at Yiyuan.</p>
<p>Town Railway Team</p>
<p>Liao Xiong</p>
<p>Yue Renxiao, Wu Jiabang</p>
<p>Lu Bingsheng, Gao Baozheng, Cao Yuming</p>
<p>Wu Binghao, Zhai Xigen, Zhang Jie, Lu Qingxiang, Lin Dianyi</p>
<p>British Navy</p>
<p>Tetteman</p>
<p>Glaisch, Feishidong</p>
<p>Datley, Bo Peiqi, McSees</p>
<p>Dileit, Simms, Heggs, James, Wilson</p>
<p>This was a game of strength. The British sailors were as strong as bulls, tall and powerful, running fast, and moving quickly. The Railway team was no match in any respect, lacking the strength and size. They were at a disadvantage in every aspect of the first half, with the British army constantly attacking. Center forward Heggs was the best, but unfortunately the forwards lacked coordination and organization, otherwise they would have won by a large margin. All that was seen was running around the field and high balls being exchanged. In the second half, the British sailors fought to the end with ten players. The Railway team seemed tired in the second half because they had used their strength fiercely in the first half. Thinking that there was no hope of a comeback, they were pleasantly surprised by Wu Binghao's goal. The Railway team's avoidance of defeat was truly fortunate.</p>
<p>The British army attacked fiercely in the first half, with the Railway team only following behind. Because the British army adopted an offensive tactic, the defenders were too far forward, so the Railway team's several counterattacks were also quite effective. Unfortunately, Lin Dianyi was a step late on one occasion, and his shot was too accurate, hitting the goalkeeper in the hands. Wu Binghao and Qu Xigen's long shots were also ineffective. On one occasion, British center-back Bo Peiqi almost scored an own goal. Until half an hour later, British center forward Heggs dribbled past three defenders and scored a goal, opening the scoring. The score was 1-0 in the first half. In the second half, Bo Peiqi injured his eye, and the British army played with ten players, focusing entirely on defense, losing all the excitement. The Railway team also showed signs of fatigue. In the last ten minutes, Zhang Jie got the ball and dribbled straight forward, passing left to Lu Qingxiang. Lu jumped up and headed the ball, but Tetteman caught it and dropped it. Wu Binghao carried the ball and himself into the net, ending the game in a 1-1 tie.</p>
