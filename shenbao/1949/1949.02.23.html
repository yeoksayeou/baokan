<h3>李代總統榮歸故里　桂林懸旗鳴炮歡迎　定今飛長沙邀程潛晉京</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿二日電〕李代總統原定廿二日晨九時飛桂林，嗣以尙有重要政務，延至午十二時始成行，到機塲恭送者有孫科·吳鐵城·吳尙　·余漢謀·薛岳·歐陽駒·張發奎等百餘人·代總統是日所乘爲雙引擎之自强號機，因桂林機塲設備不數降落四引擎之中美號機也。十二時正，代總統由孫院長等陪同步入機堪，各人面上均充滿愉快之色，與代總統蒞臨時各人之肅穆沉默情緒逈然不同。代總統旋被記者包圍，爭詢對和平及經齊新方案等問題，代總統則含笑連稱「沒有定」三字作爲答覆。代總統與恭送者一一握別後，孫院長親送至幾門，並由薛主席攙扶登機，起飛時爲十二時十分，據隨員語記者，代總統定廿三日飛長沙，屆時如白崇禧已返漢，則代總統可能飛漢一行，否則將由長返京。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿二日電〕李代總統廿二日晨八時在綏署官舍約請國大粵穗代表聯誼會全體幹事座談，到香翰屛·羅翼羣·鄧龍光·陸幼剛·蕭次尹·黃範一等十餘人，歡談至九時廿分始辭出，對於當前國是，曾就促進和平，革新政治，穩定經濟諸問題，交換意見。午十二時十三分，李代總統乘自强號專機離穗飛桂。行前，記者詢問以新經濟政策之內容及立院復會問題，李氏均避不作答。</p>
<p>〔本報桂林廿二日電〕李代總統廿二日下午二時專機返桂，李夫人與黃主席率隊至機塲歡迎，代總統乘無篷轎車入城，家家懸旗鳴砲，羣情鼓舞，萬人空巷，咸以一瞻豐采爲快，專車過街時，掌聲如雷，代總統在車中高舉禮階，頻報以歡樂微笑。</p>
<p>〔中央社桂林廿二日電〕本日全市卅萬民衆，以空前熱烈之情緒，歡迎久別桑粹之李代總統榮歸故里，全市遍懸國旗，高搭彩牌，旅桂國大代表，立·監委自省府資黃席以下各界代表二千餘人，先赴機堪恭候，下午二時半自强號機飛臨上空，旋卽平安降落，塲中軍樂齊嗚，各代表鼓掌致敬，先由李夫人偕公子趨前致候，李代總統點首含笑，與歡迎人員依次握手畢，卽乘車入城，入城時鳴禮砲廿一響，民衆夾道歡呼，商店燃放鞭砲，代總梳沿途運帽答謝，當卽驟車至省府大樓休息。下午三時至五時，分別接見旅桂國大代表，立·監委，省市及中央駐桂各機關首長及新聞記者，五時各界假省府舉行公宴，七時舉行遊藝晚會。</p>
<p>〔本報桂林廿二日電〕各界晚六時在省府歡燕李代總統，晚間在大禮堂演出桂劇，歡娛代總統夫婦。</p>
<p>〔中央社桂林廿二日電〕李代總統廿二日下午接見各界首長時，首對各界歡迎盛意表示謝意，繼對中樞有一部份人員移穗辦會，加以說明，謂外間種種傳說全係無稽、最後並徵詢各界有無困難情形，隨時可以當面表達。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿二日電〕此間盛傳李代總統廿二日可自桂飛漢，晏市長卽下令全市市懸旗歡迎，但至午後主時，尚未見代總統蒞臨。</p>
<h3>孫院長定明日返京　代總統職權運用有進步</h3>
<p>〔合衆社廣州廿二日電〕李代總統自來穗進行「團結任務」後在運用代總統職權上已略進一步。曾參與李代總統一連串會議之人士，現一致認爲，李代總統處置局勢之巧妙，殊值得讚美，並獲致各方之擁護，包括以前抱敵對態度之多人在內。孫院長與吳副院長，現定於廿四日返京，力圖挽回以前在華南組織分別單位之宏願。彼等之去留顯已不復電要，不過，彼等如繼續留任，則使政府在未來和談中有團結之象。</p>
<p>李代總統堅申和平有其可能之信念，幷宣布其改革政治之意志，此二點增強李代總統之地位。據參與會談者稱，代總統起初曾遭遇重大困難，但其逗留廣州直至獲致若干解決方止之意志，最後使對方終於軟化，現信孫科將否辭職之最後決定，端賴在京復會時之立法院。傳立委多人不滿孫院長，可能迫其退出。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州廿二日電〕李代總統此行，對政府內部之團結，已獲一致之諒解，孫院長將於廿四日飛京，吳副院長鐵城因尙需參加廿三日之政務會議，故廿二日未離穩，可能與孫院長同行</p>
<h3>新經濟方案即可公布　今提政務會討論　成敗關鍵仍在通貨賑縮</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿二日電〕李代總統今廿二日在官舍召集關於財經改革新方案會議，孫科·吳鐵城·徐堪·劉攻芸·席德懋·丁世祺等均參加。聞已作最後之決定，俟明廿三日政院會議討論通過後卽可公布施行，據有關方面透露：該方案內容將包括：（一）開放黃金外匯自由市塲，（二）將央行所存金銀拋放完全作平抑物價，（三）准許銀元自由流通，（四）發行美金公債。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟新方案公布前夕，各方推測頗多，討論之中心爲銀圓與金圓券之比例以及黃金與銀圓之比例。據悉：此問題徐財長在滬時，亦曾與劉攻芸及央行高級人員作多次討論，當時原擬以改幣時之五角銀輔幣作爲掛牌之銀圓，但最後考慮及五角銀幣之含銀量本少，每枚僅有純銀一錢八分，如將其作價半圓，則目前流通市面之銀圓勢必大漲，進而影饗整個物價，故最後決定改鑄「船洋」並以此作爲掛牌之銀圓。至於牌價，因關係電大，尙待廣州政務會議愼重硏究後決定。將來銀圓發行之方式，亦値得嚴重考慮，以免因黑市之波動，發生類似之存兌風潮。中央造幣廠方面，目前機器及材料已大致準備就緒，接到命令後一星期內，可開始鑄造，惟外傳每日開鑄五十萬，則現有機件尙不能應付，發行局方面表示國行保存之銀圓爲數甚多，新方案實施後，將先拋出庫存銀圓，再行趕鑄「船洋」，以應市面之而求。外界對新方案之看法，認爲成敗之關鍵仍在金圖券是否能不繼續膨脹一點，如能緊縮發行，則物價可能因此而穩定，反之，則銀元之牌價必與黑市脫節，每次掛高適成漲風之指標，銀元重復成爲珍藏之金融性商品，琉通市而者將仍爲價値日减之金圓券。（請參閱第四版）</p>
<p>〔聯合社廣州廿二日電〕機悉，行政院今晨舉行非正式會議時，曾討論規定金圓券與銀幣比率等問題。新經濟方案或將於二十三日公布·</p>

<h3>美國對日政策不會變</h3>
<p>正値美國陸軍部重新檢討日本政策之際，陸次屈拉普突向杜魯門總統呈請辭職，當即批准於本月廿八日爲辭職交卸期。消息傳來，日人極度不安，認爲屈拉普之離去華府，可能影響美國扶日政策，故日人於械度震驚中，僉表悲觀心理。中國人士對於美陸軍部人事變動，亦抱一種懷疑心理，以爲從此美國對日復興計劃將有變更。實則這一連串的推測，都是錯誤的，膚淺的看法。日本人的心理基於患得患失，所以容易發生喜怒：中國人多不明瞭美國的對日政策，所以對於屈拉普之離去，便以爲美國對日政策可能有了轉換的跡象。我們爲了澄淸這種種錯誤的看法，爰就所知，將屈拉普離去華府原因，及華府對日政策之不變，分析如次：</p>
<p>一，屈拉普的辭職，是共和黨在陸軍部失勢的一種事實。美國陸海空軍及參謀機構人事，在故總統羅斯福時代，乃民主共和兩黨合作時代，副總統杜魯門繼承總統後，仍循此項制度不變。今次民主黨杜魯門競選成功，國務卿已易人，戰略決定首腦已移爲艾森豪威爾元帥，杜魯門切的施政，正向勵精圖治，整軍經武的道路邁進，而人事上完全以民主黨人爲主體；因此代表共和黨參加軍界的屈拉普，其退出陸軍部亦爲自然之事。</p>
<p>二，屈拉普之離去陸軍部，今後駐日盟軍統帥麥克阿瑟似乎失去了臂助，而麥克阿瑟元帥管制日本的威望，人事上或將發生一些影響，但政策方面實無影響可言。麥克阿瑟元帥同爲共和黨人，麥帥與華爾街的關係，日本金融實業界與華爾街的關係，屈拉普即爲牽綫人。屈拉普於一九四七年十月就任　次起，對於日德兩國佔領政策，多有　劃，允其對於管制日本政策，陸軍部完全以麥帥的意見爲依據，有人問陸軍部：「你們對日佔領政策的最後決定在那裏」？戲講答稱：「決定在東京」。即指決定在麥帥主持的盟軍總部。月前陸畏羅雅爾偕同魏德邁訪日，主要目的係與麥克阿瑟等會商日本問題，共次便是調合陸軍部與東京盟總在人事上的歧見。羅雅爾退歸華府後的言行，似乎並不利於麥帥，因而屈拉普之與羅雅爾分手，也是一樁人事自然常事，毫無理由可解釋爲美國對日政策有了變更。</p>
<p>三，美國輿論不歡迎屈拉普，年來對屈拉普報吿書允多抨擊。故今次屈拉普之失勢可謂爲反扶日輿論獲得了初步的勝利，但並非完全轉移了美國的對日政策。屈拉普在陸次任內，去歲曾率領規模甚大之調査團，訪問日本南韓，轟動世界的「屈拉普報吿書」，反對日本賠償，主張建立日本高工業水準，完成日本經濟復與，進而控制東亞的市塲，即爲屈拉普的執筆。此項報吿書自公佈以後，普遍引起世界各國的反對，中國朝野的反響允爲重大。華府初擬將「屈拉普報吿書」提交遠東委員會，作爲美國對日政策的具體意見，嗣因國內外反應欠焦，國務院也有審愼提出的表示，始暫時將報吿書置諸高關。可是華府和東京盟總的對日政策，年來依然是循向這個方向走，特別是麥帥若干牴觸連東委員會決議的命令，完全與「屈拉普報吿書」主張，不謀而合。所以在形式上看，「屈拉普報吿書」確米提出，形成法案，但在實際上說，麥克阿瑟元帥早已成爲報吿書的忠實執行人。年來山於美國輿論對報吿書的抨擊。以及麥帥管制日本的失敗，再加上共和黨在政治上失勢的各種內素，可知屈拉普之悄然離去華府，完全是屈拉普及其背後人威望削减的必然結果，但非華府扶日政策根本上發生動搖。看情勢，今後美國扶日政策的全般檢討，將以艾森豪威爾和羅雅爾爲主體，但他們是否將變史根本的原則，此時未易預測。</p>
<p>根據以上所述，我們可以相信美國對日政策，根本上是未必即會變史的。如果眞有變更的話，則下列兩事的發生，可以解释爲對日政策的變更：（一）完全變更單獨管制日本的政策；（二）召開對日和會，維待四國否決權。可是這兩事的實現跡象，目前不僅沒有，而且也不會有的。因此對於屈拉普之辭職，不應抱有幻想，更不必懷疑美國對日復興計劃將有變更。</p>
<h3>中共轄區美領及職員　音訊斷絕已數週　平領館尚能與華府通電</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕國務院宣稱：中共轄境美國領事及職員廿餘人音訊斷絕已數星期，惟截至目前爲止，未聞有受虐待情事。潘陽美領事華德等十三人，自去年十一月十八日後，消息卽吿中斷。天津美領事史密斯等十人，一星期來亦與外界失去連絡。該兩地美領事館一向自設電台，共軍佔領後數日尙准使用，旋遭封閉。國務院現正設法與之恢復通訊。同時，北平美領事館已能與華府通電。館內除領事克魯伯外，共計職員四十六人，另有華文學校學生與美僑多人。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕此間若干外交人士廿二日指出：天津及瀋陽中共當局，拒絕簽發准許美國領事館收發無綫電報的執照，卽爲中共强硬態度的表徵。</p>
<p>據潘陽來客的片斷的可靠談片，雖然中共佔領藩陽，已逾四閱月，但仍漠視外國領事館，領事館官員迄未能與中共當局作任何接觸。渠等稱：美國領事館人員被限於其居所，事實上已與外界隔絕，但英法兩國領事館人員則亨有較大的行動自由。在天津的領事館人員，雖享有行動自由，但其被漠視的情形，則一如潘陽。若干人士認爲：如謂中共在天津對領事館不相往來的熊度表示一種確定的趨向，則尙屬過早。渠等指出：中共佔領天津僅一月，因此渠等可能尙未及時建立適當的官方機構，處理與外國領事館有關的事務。渠等稱：中共在東北及瀋陽的能度，不能與在華北的態度等量齊觀。</p>

<p>曾語記者「將特別着重於治安與生產兩方面。」而在這兩方面，他似對後者特別感覺興趣，他說：「街口水力發電必須促他成功，浙贛路應由金華通往溫州，錢塘江使正式通航，則經濟情形一定可以改觀，今日我們談治安，如果剛以兵力鬥勝，是消極的，我們應該以發展經濟事業充裕入民生計，使人人有飯吃，有衣穿，這才算是積極的治安工作。」陳氏在職期間，羅致專家學者以及其麾下的各主管訂定了十年計劃，到今天爲止，我們可以大膽的說，陳氏的方針沒有錯，他認爲「安定首以民生爲始」的見解是治本的辦法，猶如他毅然決然地實行了土地改革，不管他的土地改革是否澈底？是否合乎人民的需要。但我們認爲他有勇氣提出，他是對的。又如他所舉辦的農民學校，從改良士地爲入手，把增產提到最高度，把農民生活加以改善。我們也不管他的款屬範疇如何，是否可以達成他的目的，不過他</p>
<p>有勇氣這樣做</p>
<p>已經很難能可貴了。我們應該記住，陳氏是六十七歲的高齡，以他這樣的年紀，而他和記者數度傾談中，覺得他的思想，實在超越了一般廿餘齡的年靑人。他是三民主義的信仰者，他認定先要解決民生主義，他認定社會主義是最新的主義（三民主義亦卽是社會主義），他反對以暴力來制服社會的。他愛好和平，他希望世界永沒有戰爭，讓大家從事於理論的鬥爭，來共同努力於新社會，新中國，新世界的建設。</p>
<p>記者曾接觸各省主席甚多，如陳氏之思想者，似不易多得。我們可以這樣講，陳氏相信政治弄好，一切均可迎刃而解，但政治的前提條件在思想，他認爲思想應該自由，而暴力則應予反對。我記得陳氏在未被免職前接見我的一次暢談中，他曾證：「正確的思想可以消滅歪曲的思想。」</p>
<p>記者認爲陳氏治浙的大前提以及一切的設施，大體講來都是對的。不過在陳氏任內，</p>
<p>人事更迭頻繁</p>
<p>。尤允其是各縣縣長方面的更迭最多，不三月一次，不二月一次者多有，我們覺得辦理一件事情，二三月中來能見效者甚多，何况頭緒紛繁的縣長，我們任一縣長總希望他對地方有好處，如果要有好處，二三月內也未能見效，所以我們覺得陳氏對縣長的更迭太易，允其對於縣長的能力似未有相當的考驗。再陳氏思想維新，見解精闢，對其他一切相反的意見不甚易獲信頓，這也是遺憾的一點，因爲雖然人言言殊，但人家談的當有其一部份的理由，未始不能引作參考。</p>
<p>現在，陳氏去矣，我們實不勝依依之感。因爲陳氏之去，並非因爲更迭縣長次數太多與不大考量一般人的評論，陳氏之去，係行政院的決議，中樞的意思。繼來的周奉璋氏，是一位中國</p>
<p>傳統模範軍人，當記者見面時，他持別强調治安的重要。誠然，今天的浙江治安已到了嚴重的邊綠，周氏以百戰之身，治此稍稍不寗之區，自無問題，不過，我們回憶中山先生之言，「建設之首要在民生，」自當於治安之餘，兼及民生的建設。我與周氏傾談中，深覺周氏係一爽期明快之人物，周氏再三稱集軍政於一身，深感艱鉅，我們以爲中樞的意思，如果周氏單有軍權，或未能達成理想，故再假之以政權，使軍政合一，庶幾如臂之使指，利於指揮。我們希望周氏在戎馬倥　之餘，要衡量以往治浙者的得失，進而提高浙省的政治效率。</p>

<h3>美政府當局開始考慮　軍事援助新計劃　西歐方面約需十億左右　我國可能獲得援助端視局勢而定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕據探悉，政府已暫時決定要求國會撥付十二億至二十億美元的「空白支票」，以爲對全世界「自由」國家的軍事援助，包括軍備在內。「自由」國家中，可能將包括中國及韓國。向國會提出單一的軍事援助法案，以爲北大西洋安全公約之輔助計劃，卽將由以助理國務卿葛羅斯爲自的特種委員會擬成。杜魯門總統或將要求十億元左右的對大西洋公約國家的軍事援助，以及二億至十億元對希。土。韓及拉丁美洲的軍事援助，中國亦可能包括在內。政府人士現正存在着一種堅決的情緒，卽要求國會授權總統依照美國戰略家綜合的世界局勢，決定撥出軍事援助若干，此舉將使政府能在中國局勢許可此種援助時，擁嚴新軍事援助至中國。根據政府內部若干官方人士意見，如欲加速軍事援助，則勢將自陸·海·空三軍的目前軍械供應中提出，因二次世界大戰中的剩餘物資，現已絕無僅有，軍事援助物資大部份，必將自軍事部門中可能節省的現有存貨中撥出。因此，最初步的現金支出，將爲包裝及運輸軍械的費用，蓋裝運新軍械至海外，勢將需要較長的時間。政府人員强調，在目前，對每一國家的軍事援助數額尙未加支配，此舉係配合保持軍事援助計劃的「流通性」的「空白支票」原則。但關于對國會提出的北大西洋公約國家的軍事援助計劃數額，大致已確定爲十億元左右。官員稱，對希·土·韓·拉丁美洲的軍事援助問題，尙少決定性，對北大西洋公約國以外的世界自由國家的軍事援助總額的全面估計，則約在二億至十億美元之問。政府希望在三月底或四月初，向國會提出北大西洋公約，官員認爲軍械法案則可望接踵提出，渠　指稱此兩種法案問的關係等于「車輛和拖車」。</p>
<h3>草擬大西洋盟約最後定稿　七國將再度會談　美願保證共同抵抗侵略</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕國務卿艾契遜將於明後日復與英法加荷比盧六國大使商談大西洋公約事。一般相信艾契遜與六國大使因獲美與論與參院外委會之贊助，已增强力量，今益可自由草擬該公約之最後定稿。美國將依守其憲法範圍於一簽字國被攻時允予援助，衆意七國將同意認一簽字國被攻，卽爲簽約國全體彼攻，至於應否取軍事計劃，則任令各有關國家決定之。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕高級官員今日宣稱，美國將在北大西洋聯防條約中，保證任何簽約國如被攻擊，美國決不袖手旁觀。最後措辭雖尙待擬訂，但其中一條將規定美國抵抗侵略之決心，殆無疑問。同時，國務院官員宣稱，艾契遜已與參院外委會對於此項保證之性質，意見已一致，現定一二日內接見加拿大與西歐五國大使舉行最後一次談判。國務院希望在一個月內向議會提出條的草案與軍事援助西歐計劃。軍事援助計劃須經參衆兩院批准始可實行，大致將規定供給西歐以價値三十餘億元之軍備，包括美軍現有剩餘物資在內，第一年度供給十餘億元。該項計劃究由何人負責辦理，尙未決定。盛傳美國政府任命西默最高統帥一人主持其事，但一部份官員則認此舉或將妨害西歐各國之信心</p>
<h3>大西洋防禦協定　不違反英蘇條約</h3>
<p>麥克尼爾答左翼議員問</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿一日電〕英國務大臣麥克尼爾今在下院答覆共黨議員巴勒丁及工黨極左派議員華爾貝之詢問時宣稱，英政府將盡力保證大西洋公約之條文，與聯合國憲章之一般目的相符。麥氏續稱，渠可向國會保證，英政府絕無侵略意圖。與聯合國憲章原則相符之防禦協定，不致遠反英蘇條約。華爾貝要求政府保證決不同意英國須自動參戰，或從事軍事行動之條款，且其他各國亦均未接受上項規定。麥氏答稱，參加討論公約之任何政府，均未祖負軍事義務。華爾貝可獲保證卽政府將牢記其所提出之意見。</p>
<h3>胡佛委員會　責美情報局無能</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕胡佛委員會廿一日稱，國務院情報局是該院「最無能最少效率的一部門」。該局顯然「太着重純研究工作，而研究工作在國務院內並無用處」。委員會並稱，該局與中央情報機關之關係，乃「競爭而非合作」。此種　評係包含於胡佛委員會爲改組國務院而向國會建議之「外交」報吿內。該會建議任命一特別助理國務鄕負責情報活動，渠將負責監督國務院內之研究及情報工作，「指導」海外較小之情報機關，並與中央情報機關保持聯絡。渠並與「計劃顧問」（建議中之國務院新職位）密切工作，以決定在外交政策方面所採行動之效果。委員會稱「情報局之錯誤觀念必須除去」，而負責人「應訓練若干有高超分析及判斷能力的人負，使彼等對院內所有情報皆可審閱」。</p>
<h3>玻內閣總辭</h3>
<p>〔聯合社玻里維亞京城廿一日電〕內閣今日總辭職，此乃一星期來政潮之結果，事前當局宣布曾確獲推翻政府陰謀。</p>
<h3>對蘇聯猶太人會　力主美蘇諒解</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社新澤西州紐蓋克廿一日電〕美進步黨領袖羣萊士廿一日在此間駐蘇聯猶太人委員會發表演說稱，以色列人利用現代農業方法，能使阿拉伯人受益匪漢，正猶蘇聯遠東之猶太自治區利用同一方法，能使東北華人受益然。按在美蘇聯猶太人委會之目的，包括募集基金及移交農業器材與蘇聯猶太自治區之猶太居民。華萊士又認爲在以色列以及在遠東猶太自治區之猶太人，可作爲英美及斯拉夫民族間之聯絡人。又稱，美蘇諒解仍爲急待解決之問題。</p>
<h3>華盛頓誕辰　聯合國休假一天</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿二日電〕聯合國今日因紀念美國國父華盛頓誕辰，休假一天，所屬安理會經社理事會及託管理事會等均未開會。</p>
<h3>盟總改變對日政策　緊縮物資援助促日經濟復興　美當局正草擬具體計劃</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿二日電〕隨美陸次屈拉普之辭職，麥帥總部之對日政策亦開始變更，麥帥總部發表稱：以前美佔領軍方面物資援助日本之政策，今後將變更，將由寬大變爲緊縮</p>
<p>〔中央社東京骨二日電〕權威人士頃吿中央社記者稱，在佔領政策中，盟國可保證必予完成之日本民主化問題刻已降居次要地位，日本是否將成爲民主國，刻已不復爲佔領當局主要關切之問題，其推行日本社會改革熟誠，亦將逐日减弱，目前唯一之重要佔領政策，乃協助日本經濟復原，使日本不再爲美國納稅人之負擔。美國在日本之政策，分爲三階段：（一）日本之非軍事化；（二）日本之民主化；（三）經濟復原。日本之非軍事化，幾已完成，然日本心理上之解除武裝，則無法量度其完成至何種程度。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕權威人士今日稱：美國高級當局正在積極草擬計劃，以便決定日本賠償問題及日本工業限度之最後政策，但尙朱成立決議，故一時不致宣布。同時遠東委員會方面希望美國在該會提出計劃，勿直接訓令麥帥，此類問題集體行動勝於單獨行動。</p>
<h3>麥帥與羅雅爾</h3>
<p>美女作家史沫特萊透露</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿一日電〕麥帥總部之遠東間諜報吿書牽涉女作家史沫特萊，史氏以控訴麥帥誹謗爲威脅，幷稱：「麥師與陸軍部長羅雅爾因整個到日政策意見不合，發生暗鬥，致使余遭殃」</p>
<h3>蘆田與犬養　演唱雙包案</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿二日電〕日民主黨蘆田派曾於廿一日舉行最後委員會及總務會聯席會議，席間北村德太郞談稱：「吾人之主張，殊爲純潔。犬養一派係由不純正之動機出發，現正高呼黨大會無效，而吾人則將於黨大會中再確認吾人之進路」。另一方面犬養派，亦於同日召開總務會議，由幹事長保利說明不承認蘆田派所主唱召開之黨大會稱：「自吉田內閣成立後，民主黨內部已招致參加入閣與反對兩派之對立。而事實上兩派之間並無任何思想上之不同，唯就參加政府之時期，有意見上之差異而已。現惹起然內分裂之危機者，乃出於欲排斥新總裁犬養之陰謀，盧田派將召集之黨大會，應認爲無效，惟有在去年黨大會中一致推戴之犬養總裁，始有召集黨大會之權限，殊爲明顯」。</p>
<h3>菲參議院分裂　議長復職無望</h3>
<p>季里諾總統支持此決議</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺廿二日電〕菲列賓參議院昨日發生分裂，議員動武，議長亞維里諾率自由黨議員十人退席。少數派　自由黨議員十二人單獨開會，一致表決罷免議長亞雜里諾，另選戈恩谷爲議長，並決定澈査亞氏舞弊行爲，季里諾總統已承認此舉爲合法。亞氏則拒絕屈服，擁護亞氏各議員，昨夜聯名宣布不再出席參院會議，以待亞氏復職，但反亞派與擁亞派已成十二對十一之比，亞氏恐無復職之望。此一僵局大約將由最高法陰裁決。參院分裂之背景，乃亞里維諾與季里諾爭取自由黨之控制權，以便獲得該黨總統候選人資格。</p>
<h3>美民主黨領導無方　未能控制新國會　各項立法遭映遇阻力</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕新民主黨國會於廿一日開始進人第八週，而杜魯門總統之立法案已陷於政治泥濘中。除互惠立法已在衆院通過外，立法方案上之主要項目，皆朱制定。主要問題如塔虎脫，哈時萊勞工法之廢除，新稅及較高之最低工資等，杜魯門必須接受折衷辦法，雖然他不願意。國會表決給與杜魯門管制工資及物價權之機會已日趨黯淡。政府之支持農萊品價格之方案仍在硏究中，尙未向國會提出。杜魯門的醫藥保險方案，經詳予解釋後，反對者日多。帮助民主黨於去年選舉獲勝之各張大組織，已開始抱怨參院領導力量之不足。左翼方面對杜魯門本人亦有所攻擊。新共和雜誌稱，如杜魯門不能刺激國會採取行動，以實現民主黨之目標，則渠將規避其這美領袖一之責任。</p>
<h3>美原子彈六百枚　失去一枚說　間諜情報不可靠</h3>
<p>〔合衆社慕尼墨廿一日電〕在廿一日審訊五名間諜時，有一文件中稱，美國共有原子彈六百枚，已在美境內喪失其一。德警察史湯姆稱，渠在波蘭難民斯達羅柴所携之婦女手提包中搜獲廿五張文件中，發現此一文件。現斯達羅柴及其他德人四名，被挫在德境美佔區任某國之間諜，在審詢中，但該五人均供稱無事。美官員稱，該被控五人所携帶之許多「情報一乃錯誤者。</p>
<h3>特港總督蘇提案　安理會擱置</h3>
<p>太平洋代管島下週討論</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿二日電〕聯合國安理會二月份輪値主席中國代表蔣廷戰，昨日將蘇聯提議任命瑞典前駐蘇大使法魯基格爲特港總督一案，予以攜置。據稱若付表決，必無用處，余亦不擬在本月內另訂日期討論該案。安理會現定廿八日開會的論美國代管太平洋島嶼問題。</p>
<h3>聯合國請蘇從旁協助　完成南北韓統一　使朝鮮委會能與北韓政權接觸</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿一日電〕據廿一日透露，聯合國已請蘇聯帮助幹旋，使蘇聯支持之北韓政府與聯合國接觸，以達或全韓之統一。聯合國秘書長李哲之將現在漢城之韓國委員會主席澳代表西敖之通知交與蘇代表馬立克。此韓國委員會乃去年十二月所成立，以「協助斡旋使達成韓國之統一及完全獨立。」西敖於二月九日報吿稱，委員會已成立一小組委員會，以便「立刻與北韓聯絡，使委員會之人員訪問北韓，以設法消除南北韓間之阻碍。小組委負會正用各種方法與北韓之領袖人物接觸，方法之一，卽請求蘇聯政府斡旋，以達到與北韓接觸之目的。」</p>
<h3>希臘外長向英建議　締結地中海聯盟　西班牙及中東國家均應列入</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿二日電〕據廿二日獲悉希外長蔡爾達里斯曾建議一項防禦同盟，使西班牙與西方民主國家聯結。蔡氏曾於廿一日與貝文外相密談二小時，並提出其建議。傳蔡氏提出二點：（一）締結北地中海國家公約，包括法·義·希·土。及西班牙，英國由於其在該區之戰略地位亦在其列。（二）東地中海國家之公約，包括以色列·阿拉伯國家·土耳其·英國，伊朗及巴基斯坦可能亦列入。</p>
<h3>擴張全國警察武力問題　日國會將予討論　傳東京警局準備配備裝甲車</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿二日電〕日本警察力量之加强問題，當吉田首相於其第二次組開時卽已言明其必要性，並已漸次成爲有實現性之問題。而在此次國會中，恐亦將正式予以討論。此一問題之重心在於：關於增加人員有主張將現行定額人員十二萬五千名增加至十五萬名，及應另設置十五萬警察隊之二種意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿二日電〕據日本報紙廿二日刋載東京地區警察武力將大量增加的消息，散佈在京　地區的七十三個警察局，每一個將加配裝甲軍十輛及吉普車一輛。計劃中並主張將東京分成五「防衛」區，每一區中，裝配齊全的自動車警察隊當準備應付「任何緊急事件」，包括羣衆暴動度任何共黨煽動的其他騷動。由於華盛頓誕辰假日，記者不能立卽自盟總負責官員處證實或否認此項消息，在任何情形下，一切關於此種性質的日本計劃，必須送交盟總官員檢討及最後批准</p>
<h3>共黨如控制日本　蘇將席捲太平洋</h3>
<p>艾契堡對記者發表談話</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕前美國駐日佔領軍第八軍軍長艾契堡中將廿一日稱：如共黨控制日本，蘇聯統率的日本軍隊可能在數年內席捲太平洋。艾契堡在接見合衆社記者時稱：「不論其他人仕認日本的戰略價値如何，但共黨對此則充分瞭解，渠等並將付出任何代價以佔領日本。艾契堡在追述日本曾在一九四二年「直叩澳洲大門」時稱：「如共黨一旦控制日本，則此事極可能在數年內電演」。渠繼稱：就渠個人之意見，共黨控制之日本不將爲「立卽」的軍事咸脅，因蘇聯海軍實力薄弱，並無水陸作戰的經騐，但如果蘇聯能使東北之原料及日本之工業潛能配合，則此種障碍可能迅卽克服。</p>
<h3>英自治領外長會議　將改在渥太華舉行</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫教廿二日電〕權咸方面廿二日預料，在建議中之本年五月自治領外長會議地點，將自錫蘭之哥侖布，改爲渥太華。傳自治領諸高級專員，上週與自治領關係部大臣貝格會議時，曾討論此一改變。據指出，參與此一會議之大部份自治領代表，先將出席成功湖之聯大會議，因此，加拿大之渥太華，將爲比較便利之地點。</p>

<h3>德境美佔區　飛來神秘彈</h3>
<p>專家研究均迷惑不解</p>
<p>〔合衆社法蘭克福廿二日電〕德境美當局今日披露，自一九四六年十月以來，有神秘飛彈四枚墮於德境美佔區，顯係火箭或噴射推進物。據按術專家等稱，彼等仍在研究最後一彈之碎片，該彈係上月卅一日墮於巴亞倫省之東北角。據稱，四彈先後均墮於希范福特迤東之同一地區，離蘇佔區約卅五哩。最後一彈之彈穴計深十呎，闊七尺，傳飛彈拖有發光尾巴長達二十呎。官員等指出，火箭等如係由蘇區放射，則其準確性誠不可思議，蓋四彈所墮地區竟如此狹小，因此彼等十分迷惑。</p>

<h3>地政局催繳地價稅　滯納罰率交予提高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市本年度地價稅仍照往年辦法分上下兩期征收，上期自一月二十六日起開征，地政局共發出繳款通知書約十七萬份，規定業戶於收到通知後一月內繳　。全年稅收預算共約四億，編列時原佔市府歲入百分之六十餘，但因幣値變動，至今祗約佔百分之三十。地價稅率爲標準地價千分之十五，本年經市參議會通過另附征千分之五自衛捐，自衛捐於上期一次征足。開征地價稅之區域，除黃浦·滬南·法華·閘北·引劉·漕涇六地籍圖外，今年又增加一塘橋區，其中黃浦區係商萊最繁盛區城，稅收佔全部百分之七十以上。</p>
<p>本年地價稅於初時對業主確爲一頗重之負祖，但因幣値波動劇烈，至今同樣之數字價値與前已不同，現市庫拮据，地政局希望各業戶能體諒市府困難，踴躍繳納。依歷年舊例，各業戶多欲挨延至截止期前數天內繳納，此短短數日爲地價稅收之「旺期」，本年上期之旺期卽屆，地政局爲獎勵市民遵限繳納，並因對滯納者，原辦法規定逾期一月祗加罰百分之十五，較月息猶低，殊不合理，故現正擬訂加强催征及滯納處罰辦法，提高罰率，短期內呈奉市府核准後卽可實施。</p>

<h3>兩綫火車　可能停駛　收入尚難應付煤款　存煤僅夠維持三日</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據自極可靠方面獲悉，京滬·滬杭兩路現有存煤，最多祗能維持到本月廿五日，如在此三日內，無法得到煤斤補充，則兩路火車可能繼浙贛路後，因斷煤而停駛。並悉，煤斤問題亦卽整個路局經濟問題，同時亦爲社會經濟及人民購買力問題，因自本年一月以來，煤價每日高漲，目前外煤每噸達五萬七千八百二十一元，台灣煤每噸三萬九千四百七十元，兩路每日用煤八百噸，平均約需款三千六百萬元，而兩路全日收入僅三千餘萬元（調整運價後之平均收入），尙不足應付煤款，更遑論改善員工待遇。節流旣不可能，開源亦實困難，蓋自本月十二日調整票價後正式旅客驟形减少，運價雖增加五倍，收入尙不足增加二倍，此寳路局當前一大危機也。</p>

<h3>工業會痛陳利弊　呈請裁撤輸管會　實施管制後阻碍重重　使正當工業陷於絕境</h3>
<p>自政府實施轍出入管制辦法後，以執行技術欠妥，弊寳叢生，工商界未蒙其益，反受其害，是以華南等處之工商界，提議撤銷輸管機構，太市工業會亦表贊同，期望尤股，曾於日前舉行輸出入研究委員會，一致響應華南工商界主張，並於昨日分電政院及財政工商兩部，略稱：輸管辦法實施兩年來，其弊端如下：（一）輸管第一類之生產器材及配件管區辦法，規定以三個月運到者發給許可證，事實上國外定貨非半年一年不能運到，致申請擴充設備補充配件者，百不得一，摧殘工業發展。（二）工業原料大都須賴外國輸入，査輸入管制第二類之工業原料，規定限額數量甚少，僅敷實際需要十之一二，且予給居間商者佔其多數，徒供投機者舉利，工業界反受剝削。（三）關於第三類之非限額，申請版捨，浸無規定，狡點者乃肆其神通，成爲黑市之淵藪，投機暴利之捷徑。（四）輸出所得之外匯，須向央行結匯，因官價與黑市之差額，致輸出者寥寥，現香港日本在南洋傾銷，我國輸出品，無法與爭。綜上所述，無論在調整進口，穩定經濟，保護生產，均未收得預期之效果，而實際應限制禁止輸入者，又未能澈底，如新型豪華汽車，冰箱，無綫電各種奢侈品，充塞市塲，至必需輸入者，其審核時儼同施捨，阻得重重，經年不得解決，至今三四五六季配額尙未辦竣，辦事效率之低，於此可見，工業界所受痛苦與損失，實非淺鮮。爰經本會各有關公會詳爲硏究，就事實與利害上之檢討，提供意見五項：（一）應請將輸出入管理委員會立卽裁撤，所有應辦業務，交由海關辦理。（二）爲增加工業生產，必須充分獲得需要之器材原料，輸入方面，規定之第一類生產器材及第二類工業原料之進口，應請不必限制，其規定種類，得由各業提出意見，由工業會呈請修正。（三）第三類附表所列品類繁多，其輸入數量，請交由本會技術委員會詳細硏究，予以規定。（四）奢侈品及國內已能自給之製成品或工業原料，仍應嚴予禁止輸入，勿因貪得高額稅收而弛禁，致國內工業再受打擊。（五）關於工業成品輸出所得之外匯，應請以百分之百，交由工廠自行尙國外購辦機件原料，俾得擴充或改進設備，而增加生產效率。</p>

<h3>馬來華僑羽毛球隊　楊威海外擊敗美國</h3>
<p>馬來亞新加坡華僑對羽球運動，異常普遍，其球藝之高超，世界聞名。去年全運會時，亦派選手來滬表演，大受衆賞。此次華僑選手數人代表馬來出席湯麥斯盃世界羽毛球錦標賽，每戰必勝，已到遠複賽週。昨據格蘭斯哥聯合社電稱，該隊正與美國作複賽，優勝者定於本週杪在英格蘭普勒斯登與丹麥爭奪世界盟主。馬來與美國隊員各六人，將在兩日內比賽九塲，採取九賽五勝制，截至目前爲止，馬來已獲初次勝利。新加坡華僑王本松（譯音）以十五比十一，十一比十五，十五比十一，擊敗加里福尼亞人孟特茲。王君攔網手法淸晰美觀，致使孟特茲抽球頗多觸網目殺。另一塲美國隊長富里曼以十五比十，十比十五，十五比四壓倒檳榔嶼華僑魏泰河（譯音），富星曼擅長進攻，自參加湯麥斯盃賽以來從未敗北，但在第二盤因魏君守網嚴密，失去一盤。</p>

<h3>銀根微轉俏象</h3>
<p>市間銀根，昨日因隔昨行局鉅進，小交換竟出十二億元以上，微轉儅象。頭寸供源轉稀，業內减少供出，週轉復趨頻冗。拆息最高八十元，大致均站七十元。一般觀測，若政府決定拋出金銀，回收金圓通貨，銀根將轉極度緊儅。現鈔籌碼，因前晚行莊搜羅後，解交央行抵單，昨日又陷枯竭，小行莊一律無現交付，本票復吿流行，貼水昂至八元。</p>
<p>本月底前後之銀根，將有一番極緊現象。週六爲廿六日，廿八日爲生活指數發表之期，又値月底，故本週週末，與下週初，可能有猛烈之緊勢。市塲大戶，近均蜷伏。其主要原因，皆以新方案之公布，防有壓力，是以本週物價，可能有下降之勢，至多亦不過呈一盤局。</p>

<h3>紗布均見疲備</h3>
<p>昨日紗布，初開卽見疲檔。良以客帮去化不暢，本街雖有納胃，但數量甚爲微小。且在新經濟方案未公佈之前，買方大多採取觀望姿態。塲內散戶受利息壓迫，咸不主守，逢高脫售，結果各紗步趨軟態。</p>

<h3>新財經方案即將公布　食糧市場漲風暫歛　客戶均存觀望貨主求售甚切</h3>
<p>米市略見下疲，上落甚微，呈盤旋之勢。無錫上日價雖曾報高，但新經濟方案卽將實施，故人心甚疲。價格初開尙平，收市終吿略挫一二百元。南市白粳及薄稻各挫一百元，早稻跌二百元，北市塲白粳降百元，早薄稻各降二百元，秈米亦挫二百元，特高粳一萬一千元。二市塲到貨共計五千四百四十七石。</p>

<h3>呢絨上漲率　較年底高六七倍</h3>
<p>呢絨行情，受種種環境關係，新正開盤以來，全部步步高升。回顯去年底價，平均統扯上漲六至七倍，其與國外其他物價比較，上漲率尙稱有限，大多歌且有背道而馳之情形。章萊花呢西服帮分料，每碼祗售八千七百五十元，支票期須三五天，市塲原定賣買價爲九千二百五十元，進出一律二三天票子，而章華廠廠盤，卽期銀子則開九千五百元，隔日銀子爲一萬元云。</p>

<p>生絲以外匯移轉證市勢盤旋，外銷價略見穩定，惟因新方案卽將頒佈，進戶觀望，更以和謠空氣濃郁，圈外各物均無好面，於是人心平淡，市上暗息雖低，但實銷寥寥，優級另担先喊五三萬五四萬，嗣後買氣不動，金鈔又跌，市勢不大，午收時，隔日頭寸做五一五〇〇〇元。</p>

<h3>四礦聯營處　調整烟煤配價</h3>

<h3>桐油盤旋</h3>
<p>桐油趨勢，自隔日價格晋升以來，昨市因頭寸泛濫，兼以國內去化尙可，故執戶扳抬之念，迭茁不戢，惟買方感於圈外物資，無一不跌，是以亦抱看小，一時不擬急切求取，過程再好無力，臨收結果轉呈盤旋局面，比前並無軒輊。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋疑　垂髫時父母代訂婚約　當事人可申請解除</h3>
<p>對方如無過失可要求賠償損失</p>
<p>張新民問　甲女現年二十六歲，三歲時由家長作主興乙男訂立婚約，甲女成年後對於此項婚約不予承認，現原媒人均已死去，而甲婦女與丙男相戀，而乙男對所訂之婚約不願放棄。請問：（一）甲女如欲與丙男結婚，是否合法？（二）如甲女僅於原籍報紙刊登正式否認之啓事，是否卽可視爲前項婚約已經失效？（三）如甲女憑證人（如律師）正式通知乙男聲明否認，而乙男拒不作答或竟表示不願，則甲女與丙男卽行結婚是否犯法？（四）乙男是否有標向甲女或丙男要求賠償損失？（五）在時間上有無關係？（六）此事丙男在法律上是否負有何種責任？</p>
<p>〔唐鳴時先生答〕（一）甲女如欲與丙男另訂婚約，應須解除與乙男之婚約。（二）解徐婚約之手續，須視陘過淸節而定；本件甲女雖請未承認，却亦謂無否認，是否有其他情節足以證明不否認而等待結婚。故登報果屬一種手續，但並非登報卽可使婚約失效也。（三）聘律師代理辦妥手續，自是正理，應將全部經過情節與律師詳細商酌，解除前約婚約，方可再與他人訂婚，不可造次，自招麻煩。（四）前項婚約之對手方，如無過失，當然可以要求賠償損失。（五）如未成年人爲家長代訂婚約，不能同意者，應於及齡時表示之，及齡以後，無有表示者，則須親情節若何而定。故時問確爲一問題也。（六）丙男如不知情，當不負責任。</p>

<h3>Li, Acting President, Returns Triumphantly to His Hometown; Guilin Welcomes Him with Flags and Cannon Salvos; Scheduled to Fly to Changsha Today to Invite Cheng Qian to the Capital</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 22nd] Acting President Li was originally scheduled to fly to Guilin at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. However, due to important official duties, the departure was delayed until 12:00 PM. Those who came to the airport to see him off included Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Shangying, Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Ouyang Ju, Zhang Fakui, and over a hundred others. The acting president traveled on the "Zi Qiang" (Self-Strengthening) aircraft, a twin-engine plane, as the Guilin airport's facilities were inadequate for the larger four-engine "Zhongmei" (Sino-American) aircraft. At precisely 12:00 PM, the acting president, accompanied by President Sun and others, entered the aircraft cabin. Everyone's faces were filled with joy, a stark contrast to the solemn and silent mood when the acting president arrived. The acting president was immediately surrounded by reporters, who eagerly inquired about peace and new economic plans. The acting president replied with a smile, repeatedly saying "No decision yet." After shaking hands with those seeing him off, President Sun personally escorted him to the aircraft door, and Chairman Xue helped him board. The plane took off at 12:10 PM. According to an aide speaking to reporters, the acting president is scheduled to fly to Changsha on the 23rd. If Bai Chongxi has already returned to Hankou, the acting president may fly to Hankou. Otherwise, he will return to the capital from Changsha.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd] At 8:00 AM on the 22nd, Acting President Li invited all the executive members of the National Assembly Guangdong-Guangzhou Representatives Association for a discussion at the Commandant's Headquarters. Those present included Xiang Hanping, Luo Yiqun, Deng Longguang, Lu Yougang, Xiao Ciyin, Huang Fanyi, and over ten others. They had a pleasant conversation until 9:20 AM before departing. They exchanged views on current national affairs, focusing on promoting peace, reforming politics, and stabilizing the economy. At 12:13 PM, Acting President Li departed from Guangzhou on a special "Zi Qiang" aircraft to fly to Guilin. Before his departure, reporters inquired about the contents of the new economic policy and the resumption of the Legislative Yuan, but Mr. Li avoided answering.</p>
<p>[Our Guilin Dispatch, 22nd] Acting President Li returned to Guilin by special plane at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. Mrs. Li and Chairman Huang led a welcoming party at the airport. The acting president rode in an open-top sedan into the city. Every household hung flags and fired cannons. The public's enthusiasm was high, and the streets were packed with people eager to catch a glimpse of his demeanor. As the motorcade passed through the streets, the applause was thunderous. The acting president raised his hat in the car, responding with joyful smiles.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 22nd] Today, the entire city of 300,000 people welcomed Acting President Li, who had been away from his hometown for a long time, with unprecedented enthusiasm. National flags were hung throughout the city, and colorful arches were erected. Over 2,000 representatives from all walks of life, including National Assembly representatives residing in Guilin, legislative and supervisory committee members, and representatives from the provincial government and below, led by Chairman Huang, went to the airport to await his arrival. At 2:30 PM, the "Zi Qiang" aircraft flew into the sky and landed safely. Military music was played in unison, and the representatives applauded to pay their respects. Mrs. Li and her son stepped forward to greet him first. Acting President Li nodded with a smile and shook hands with the welcoming personnel in order. He then entered the city by car. As he entered the city, a 21-gun salute was fired, and the people cheered along the road. Shops set off firecrackers. The acting president took off his hat along the way to express his thanks. He then drove straight to the provincial government building to rest. From 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, he separately met with National Assembly representatives, legislative and supervisory committee members, heads of provincial and municipal governments, heads of central government agencies stationed in Guilin, and journalists residing in Guilin. At 5:00 PM, all sectors held a public banquet at the provincial government, and at 7:00 PM, a variety show was held in the evening.</p>
<p>[Our Guilin Dispatch, 22nd] At 6:00 PM, all sectors held a banquet for Acting President Li at the provincial government. In the evening, a Guilin opera was performed in the auditorium to entertain the acting president and his wife.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 22nd] When Acting President Li met with leaders from all sectors on the afternoon of the 22nd, he first expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome from all sectors. He then explained the relocation of some central government personnel to Guangzhou to conduct meetings, saying that all kinds of rumors circulating outside were groundless. Finally, he inquired whether all sectors had any difficulties and could express them to him face to face at any time.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 22nd] It is widely rumored here that Acting President Li could fly to Hankou from Guilin on the 22nd. Mayor Yan immediately ordered the entire city to hang flags to welcome him, but as of noon, the acting president had not yet arrived.</p>
<h3>President Sun is Scheduled to Return to the Capital Tomorrow; Acting President's Exercise of Authority Shows Progress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 22nd] Since coming to Guangzhou to carry out the "unity mission," Acting President Li has made some progress in exercising his authority as acting president. People who have participated in a series of meetings with Acting President Li now unanimously believe that Acting President Li's skillful handling of the situation is worthy of praise and has won the support of all parties, including many who previously held hostile attitudes. President Sun and Vice President Wu are now scheduled to return to the capital on the 24th, trying to reverse their previous grand ambition of organizing separate units in South China. Their departure and stay are obviously no longer essential. However, if they continue to serve, it will give the government a united image in future peace talks.</p>
<p>Acting President Li's firm belief that peace is possible and his announcement of his will to reform politics have strengthened Acting President Li's position. According to participants in the talks, the acting president initially encountered significant difficulties, but his willingness to stay in Guangzhou until some solutions were reached finally softened the other party. The final decision on whether Sun Ke will resign now depends on the Legislative Yuan's resumption of meetings in the capital. It is rumored that many legislators are dissatisfied with President Sun and may force him to step down.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 22nd] Acting President Li's trip has achieved a unanimous understanding of the government's internal unity. President Sun will fly to the capital on the 24th. Vice President Wu Tiecheng did not leave Guangzhou on the 22nd because he still needs to attend the political affairs meeting on the 23rd and may travel with President Sun.</p>
<h3>New Economic Plan to be Announced Soon; Submitted for Discussion at Today's Political Affairs Meeting; Success or Failure Hinges on Currency Contraction</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 22nd] Today, the 22nd, Acting President Li convened a meeting at the official residence on the new financial and economic reform plan. Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Xu Kan, Liu Gongyun, Xi Demao, Ding Shiqi, and others participated. It is heard that the final decision has been made and can be announced and implemented after being discussed and approved by the Executive Yuan meeting tomorrow, the 23rd. According to related sources, the content of the plan will include: (1) Opening a free market for gold and foreign exchange, (2) Completely releasing the gold and silver stored by the Central Bank to stabilize prices, (3) Allowing the free circulation of silver dollars, and (4) Issuing US dollar bonds.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] On the eve of the announcement of the new economic plan, there are many speculations from all parties. The center of the discussion is the ratio between silver dollars and gold yuan coupons, as well as the ratio between gold and silver dollars. It is learned that Finance Minister Xu also had multiple discussions with Liu Gongyun and senior Central Bank officials in Shanghai. At that time, it was originally intended to use the five-cent silver auxiliary coins at the time of the currency change as the silver dollar for listing prices. However, after final consideration, the silver content of the five-cent silver coins is inherently low, with each coin containing only 0.18 taels of pure silver. If it is priced at half a yuan, the silver dollars currently circulating in the market will inevitably rise sharply, further affecting overall prices. Therefore, the final decision was made to recast the "ship ocean" [referring to the silver dollar with Sun Yat-sen's image] and use it as the silver dollar for listing prices. As for the listed price, because it is of great importance, it still needs to be carefully studied and decided at the Guangzhou political affairs meeting. The method of issuing silver dollars in the future is also worth serious consideration to avoid similar runs on banks due to fluctuations in the black market. The Central Mint has generally prepared the machinery and materials and can start casting within a week of receiving the order. However, the external rumor that 500,000 coins will be cast daily cannot be met with the existing machinery. The Issuing Bureau stated that the National Bank has a large number of silver dollars in storage. After the new plan is implemented, the stored silver dollars will be released first, and then the "ship ocean" will be rushed to meet the market demand. The outside world believes that the key to the success or failure of the new plan lies in whether the gold yuan coupons can avoid continued expansion. If the issuance can be tightened, prices may stabilize. Otherwise, the listed price of silver dollars will inevitably be divorced from the black market, and each price increase will become an indicator of the rising trend. Silver dollars will repeatedly become collectible financial commodities, and the value of gold yuan coupons, which depreciates daily, will still circulate in the market. (Please see page 4)</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 22nd] It is learned that the Executive Yuan discussed issues such as the ratio of gold yuan coupons to silver coins at an informal meeting this morning. The new economic plan may be announced on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Hubei and Zhejiang Provincial Governments; Presidential Decree Issued for Appointments and Removals</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>US Policy Towards Japan Will Not Change</h3>
<p>Just as the U.S. Department of the Army is re-examining its policy towards Japan, Under Secretary of the Army Draper suddenly submitted his resignation to President Truman, which was immediately approved, with his resignation taking effect on the 28th of this month. When the news arrived, the Japanese were extremely uneasy, believing that Draper's departure from Washington might affect the U.S. policy of supporting Japan, so the Japanese expressed pessimistic feelings in the midst of extreme shock. Chinese people also harbor a kind of suspicion regarding the personnel changes in the U.S. Department of the Army, believing that the U.S. plan for the reconstruction of Japan will change from now on. In fact, this series of speculations are all wrong and superficial views. The psychology of the Japanese is based on fear of gain and loss, so they are prone to joy and anger. Most Chinese people do not understand the U.S. policy towards Japan, so they think that the U.S. policy towards Japan may have changed with Draper's departure. In order to clarify these various erroneous views, we will analyze the reasons for Draper's departure from Washington and the unchanging nature of Washington's policy towards Japan, based on what we know, as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Draper's resignation is a fact that the Republican Party has lost ground in the Department of the Army. During the era of the late President Roosevelt, the personnel of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and staff agencies were in an era of cooperation between the Democratic and Republican parties. After Vice President Truman succeeded the presidency, he still followed this system unchanged. This time, the Democrat Truman was successfully elected, the Secretary of State has been replaced, and the head of strategic decision-making has been transferred to Marshal Eisenhower. Truman's administration is moving towards the road of striving for good governance, consolidating the army, and personnel is completely dominated by Democrats. Therefore, it is natural for Draper, who represents the Republican Party in the military, to withdraw from the Department of the Army.</p>
<p>2.  Draper's departure from the Department of the Army seems to have left General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, without an assistant, and Marshal MacArthur's prestige in controlling Japan may be somewhat affected in terms of personnel, but there is no impact in terms of policy. Marshal MacArthur is also a Republican, and the relationship between MacArthur and Wall Street, and the relationship between the Japanese financial and business circles and Wall Street, with Draper as the link. Since Draper took office as Under Secretary in October 1947, he has made many plans for the occupation policies of Japan and Germany. The Department of the Army completely based its policies on the opinions of MacArthur regarding the control of Japan. Someone asked the Department of the Army: "Where is the final decision on your occupation policy towards Japan?" The joking answer was: "The decision is in Tokyo," referring to the Allied Headquarters presided over by MacArthur. A month ago, Under Secretary Royal, along with Wedemeyer, visited Japan. The main purpose was to discuss the Japanese issue with MacArthur and others, and the second was to reconcile the personnel differences between the Department of the Army and the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo. Royal's words and deeds after returning to Washington seemed to be unfavorable to MacArthur, so Draper's separation from Royal is also a natural personnel matter, and there is no reason to explain it as a change in the U.S. policy towards Japan.</p>
<p>3.  U.S. public opinion does not welcome Draper, and there has been much criticism of Draper's reports over the years. Therefore, Draper's loss of power this time can be said to be a preliminary victory for the anti-Japan support public opinion, but it does not completely shift the U.S. policy towards Japan. During Draper's tenure as Under Secretary, he led a large-scale investigation team to visit Japan and South Korea last year, and the world-shaking "Draper Report," which opposed Japanese reparations, advocated establishing a high industrial level in Japan, completing Japan's economic recovery, and then controlling the East Asian market, was written by Draper. Since the publication of this report, it has generally aroused opposition from countries around the world, and the reaction from China, both in the government and among the people, has been significant. Washington initially planned to submit the "Draper Report" to the Far Eastern Commission as the specific opinion of the United States on its policy towards Japan, but due to the lack of focus of domestic and foreign reactions, the State Department also expressed a cautious proposal, and the report was temporarily put on hold. However, Washington and the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo have been following this direction in their policy towards Japan over the years. In particular, some of MacArthur's orders that contradicted the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission completely coincided with the "Draper Report's" advocacy. Therefore, in terms of form, the "Draper Report" has not been formally proposed to form a bill, but in reality, Marshal MacArthur has long become a faithful executor of the report. Over the years, due to the criticism of the report by American public opinion, and the failure of MacArthur's control of Japan, coupled with various internal factors of the Republican Party's loss of power in politics, it can be seen that Draper's quiet departure from Washington is entirely the inevitable result of the reduction in the prestige of Draper and the people behind him, but it is not a fundamental shift in Washington's policy of supporting Japan. Looking at the situation, the overall review of the U.S. policy of supporting Japan in the future will be mainly based on Eisenhower and Royal, but whether they will change the fundamental principles is not easy to predict at this time.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we can believe that the U.S. policy towards Japan will not necessarily change fundamentally. If there is a real change, the occurrence of the following two things can be interpreted as a change in the policy towards Japan: (1) Completely changing the policy of unilateral control of Japan; (2) Convening a peace conference with Japan, maintaining the veto power of the four countries. However, there are not only no signs of the realization of these two things at present, but also will not be. Therefore, one should not have illusions about Draper's resignation, and there is no need to doubt that the U.S. plan for the reconstruction of Japan will change.</p>
<h3>US Consuls and Staff in Communist-Controlled Areas Have Been Out of Contact for Several Weeks, Beiping Consulate Can Still Communicate with Washington</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] The State Department announced that more than 20 U.S. consuls and staff in Communist-controlled areas have been out of contact for several weeks, but so far, there have been no reports of abuse. Thirteen people, including U.S. Consul Ward in Pan Yang, have been out of contact since November 18th of last year. Ten people, including U.S. Consul Smith in Tianjin, have also lost contact with the outside world for a week. The U.S. consulates in these two places have always had their own radio stations, which were allowed to be used for several days after the Communist army occupied them, but were subsequently closed. The State Department is now trying to restore communication with them. At the same time, the U.S. consulate in Beiping has been able to communicate with Washington. In addition to Consul Clubb, there are a total of 46 staff members in the consulate, as well as students from Chinese language schools and many American expatriates.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Some diplomatic figures here pointed out on the 22nd that the refusal of the Communist authorities in Tianjin and Shenyang to issue licenses allowing the U.S. consulates to send and receive radio telegrams is a manifestation of the Communist Party's tough attitude.</p>
<p>According to fragmentary and reliable talks from visitors to Pan Yang, although the Communists have occupied Pan Yang for more than four months, they still disregard the foreign consulates, and the consulate officials have not been able to make any contact with the Communist authorities. They said that the staff of the U.S. consulate are confined to their residences and are effectively isolated from the outside world, but the staff of the British and French consulates enjoy greater freedom of movement. Although the consulate staff in Tianjin enjoy freedom of movement, they are ignored in the same way as in Pan Yang. Some people believe that it is too early to say that the Communist Party's attitude of non-interaction with the consulates in Tianjin represents a definite trend. They pointed out that the Communists have only occupied Tianjin for a month, so they may not have had time to establish appropriate official institutions to deal with matters related to foreign consulates. They said that the attitude of the Communist Party in the Northeast and Shenyang cannot be equated with the attitude in North China.</p>

<h3>Change of Zhejiang Province Chairman: From Chen Yi to Zhou Yan; Our Special Correspondent Chu Xuanchuan Yusheng</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 20th] I still remember when Shen Chengzhang, the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, was approved to resign in July of the 37th year of the Republic, and Chen Gongqia was appointed to succeed him. At that time, this reporter wrote a report on the gains and losses of Shen's governance of Zhejiang, and placed unlimited expectations on Chen's governance of Zhejiang. Over the years, Chen governed Zhejiang for more than seven months, and the central government once again heard of his dismissal. He was succeeded by Zhou Fengzhang, who had experienced hundreds of battles. This reporter, at the urging of various parties, once again wrote to record the gains and losses of Chen's governance of Zhejiang and Zhou's future approach to governing Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Chen Yi's Beginning of Governing Zhejiang</p>
<p>He once told reporters that he would "especially focus on security and production." In these two areas, he seemed particularly interested in the latter. He said: "The Jiekou Hydropower Station must be promoted to success, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway should extend from Jinhua to Wenzhou, and the Qiantang River should be officially opened to navigation, then the economic situation will definitely improve. Today, when we talk about security, if we only use military force to win, it is passive. We should develop economic undertakings to enrich the people's livelihood, so that everyone has food to eat and clothes to wear. This is considered active security work." During his tenure, Chen recruited experts and scholars and his subordinates to formulate a ten-year plan. To this day, we can boldly say that Chen's direction was not wrong. He believed that "stability begins with people's livelihood" is a fundamental solution, just as he resolutely implemented land reform, regardless of whether his land reform was thorough or met the needs of the people. But we believe he had the courage to propose it, and he was right. For example, the peasant schools he organized started with improving land, putting increased production to the highest degree, and improving farmers' lives. We also don't care about the scope of his funds, whether he can achieve his goals, but he</p>
<p>Had the Courage to Do So</p>
<p>It's already commendable. We should remember that Chen is 67 years old. At his age, and in his several conversations with reporters, it was felt that his thinking really surpassed that of the average young person in their twenties. He is a believer in the Three Principles of the People. He believes that the Principle of People's Livelihood must be solved first. He believes that socialism is the newest doctrine (the Three Principles of the People are also socialism). He opposes using violence to subdue society. He loves peace, he hopes the world will never have war, and that everyone can engage in theoretical struggles to work together for the construction of a new society, a new China, and a new world.</p>
<p>This reporter has come into contact with many provincial chairmen, and it seems difficult to find many with Chen's thinking. We can say that Chen believes that if politics are done well, everything can be solved easily, but the prerequisite for politics is thought. He believes that thought should be free, and violence should be opposed. I remember that in a frank conversation with me before Chen was dismissed, he once said: "Correct thoughts can eliminate distorted thoughts."</p>
<p>This reporter believes that Chen's major premise for governing Zhejiang and all his facilities are generally correct. However, during Chen's tenure,</p>
<p>Personnel Changes Were Frequent</p>
<p>Especially the changes in county magistrates were the most frequent. Many were changed not once in three months, or once in two months. We feel that many things can be effective in two or three months, let alone the county magistrate with complex issues. We always hope that any county magistrate will be good for the local area. If there is to be good, it cannot be effective in two or three months, so we feel that Chen's changes to the county magistrates were too easy, and it seems that there was not enough testing of the abilities of the county magistrates. Furthermore, Chen's thinking is innovative, his views are insightful, and he is not easily convinced by other opposing opinions, which is also a regret, because although people's opinions are different, there must be some part of the reason for what people are talking about, which may not be used as a reference.</p>
<p>Now, Chen is gone, and we really feel reluctant. Because Chen's departure is not because of the excessive number of county magistrates changed or the lack of consideration of general people's comments. Chen's departure is a decision of the Executive Yuan, the meaning of the central government. His successor, Zhou Fengzhang, is a Chinese</p>
<p>Traditional Model Soldier. When the reporter met him, he particularly emphasized the importance of security. Indeed, the security situation in Zhejiang today has reached a serious edge. With Zhou's battle-tested background, governing this slightly uneasy area should not be a problem. However, we recall Mr. Sun Yat-sen's words, "The top priority of construction is the people's livelihood," so in addition to security, we should also consider the construction of people's livelihood. In my conversation with Zhou, I deeply felt that Zhou is a straightforward and decisive person. Zhou repeatedly claimed that he felt the burden of combining military and political power in one body. We believe that the central government's intention is that if Zhou only has military power, he may not be able to achieve his ideals, so he is given political power again, so that the military and politics are united, which is beneficial for command. We hope that in addition to his busy military affairs, Zhou will weigh the gains and losses of previous rulers of Zhejiang and further improve the political efficiency of Zhejiang Province.</p>

<h3>US Government Authorities Begin Considering New Military Aid Plan; Western Europe Needs About One Billion; Whether China Can Receive Aid Depends on the Situation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] It has been learned that the government has tentatively decided to request Congress to allocate a "blank check" of $1.2 billion to $2 billion for military aid, including armaments, to "free" countries around the world. Among the "free" countries, China and South Korea may be included. A single military aid bill to Congress to support the North Atlantic Security Pact is about to be drafted by a special committee headed by Assistant Secretary of State Gross. President Truman may request approximately $1 billion in military aid to countries of the Atlantic Pact, and $200 million to $1 billion in military aid to Greece, Turkey, Korea, and Latin America, and China may also be included. There is now a strong sentiment among government officials to request Congress to authorize the President to decide on the amount of military aid to be allocated based on the overall world situation assessed by American strategists. This will enable the government to provide new military aid to China if the situation in China permits such aid. According to the opinions of some officials within the government, if military aid is to be accelerated, it will have to be drawn from the current ordnance supplies of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, because the surplus materials from World War II are now almost exhausted, and most of the military aid materials will have to be allocated from existing stocks that can be saved by the military departments. Therefore, the initial cash expenditure will be the cost of packaging and transporting ordnance, because shipping new ordnance overseas will take a longer time. Government officials emphasized that, at present, the amount of military aid to each country has not yet been allocated. This measure is in line with the "blank check" principle of maintaining the "fluidity" of the military aid plan. However, the amount of the military aid plan for countries of the North Atlantic Pact to be submitted to Congress has been largely determined to be approximately $1 billion. Officials said that the issue of military aid to Greece, Turkey, Korea, and Latin America is still less decisive, and the overall estimate of the total amount of military aid to free countries of the world outside the North Atlantic Pact is between approximately $200 million and $1 billion. The government hopes to submit the North Atlantic Pact to Congress at the end of March or early April. Officials believe that the ordnance bill can be expected to follow closely, and they pointed out that the relationship between the two bills is equivalent to "vehicles and trailers."</p>
<h3>Seven Countries Will Meet Again to Draft Final Draft of Atlantic Alliance; US Willing to Guarantee Joint Resistance to Aggression</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] Secretary of State Acheson will meet with the ambassadors of the six countries of Britain, France, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg tomorrow and the day after tomorrow to discuss the Atlantic Pact. It is generally believed that Acheson and the ambassadors of the six countries have gained strength because of the support of American public opinion and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and now they can draft the final draft of the pact more freely. The United States will, within the scope of its constitution, agree to provide assistance when a signatory country is attacked. The consensus is that the seven countries will agree that an attack on one signatory country is an attack on all signatory countries. As for whether to adopt a military plan, it will be up to the relevant countries to decide.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Senior officials declared today that the United States will guarantee in the North Atlantic Treaty of Collective Defense that the United States will not stand idly by if any signatory country is attacked. Although the final wording is still to be drafted, one of the clauses will stipulate the United States' determination to resist aggression, which is beyond doubt. At the same time, State Department officials declared that Acheson and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have reached a consensus on the nature of this guarantee, and are now scheduled to meet with the ambassadors of Canada and five Western European countries in the next day or two to hold a final round of negotiations. The State Department hopes to submit the draft of the treaty and the plan for military aid to Western Europe to Congress within a month. The military aid plan must be approved by both houses of Congress before it can be implemented. It will generally stipulate the supply of military equipment worth more than $3 billion to Western Europe, including existing surplus materials of the US military, with more than $1 billion to be supplied in the first year. It has not yet been decided who will be responsible for handling the plan. It is rumored that the US government will appoint a supreme commander to preside over the matter, but some officials believe that this move may harm the confidence of Western European countries.</p>
<h3>Atlantic Defense Agreement Does Not Violate Anglo-Soviet Treaty</h3>
<p>McNeil Answers Questions from Left-Wing Members of Parliament</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] British Minister of State McNeil declared in the House of Commons today in response to inquiries from Communist MP Baradin and far-left Labor MP Walberg that the British government will do its best to ensure that the provisions of the Atlantic Pact are in line with the general purposes of the United Nations Charter. McNeil continued, "I can assure Parliament that the British government has no intention of aggression. A defensive agreement that is in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter will not be far from violating the Anglo-Soviet Treaty." Walberg asked the government to guarantee that it would never agree to clauses that require Britain to automatically enter the war or engage in military action, and that other countries have not accepted the above provisions. McNeil replied that no government participating in the discussion of the pact has undertaken military obligations. Walberg can be assured that the government will keep his views in mind.</p>
<h3>Hoover Commission Blames US Intelligence Agency for Incompetence</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The Hoover Commission said on the 21st that the State Department Intelligence Bureau is the "most incompetent and least efficient department" in the department. The Bureau apparently "places too much emphasis on pure research, and research is of no use within the State Department." The Commission also said that the relationship between the Bureau and the Central Intelligence Agency is "competition rather than cooperation." The above assessment is contained in the "Diplomacy" report, which the Hoover Commission recommended to Congress for the reorganization of the State Department. The Council recommended the appointment of a Special Assistant Secretary of State responsible for intelligence activities, who will be responsible for supervising research and intelligence work within the State Department, "guiding" smaller intelligence agencies overseas, and maintaining liaison with the Central Intelligence Agency. He also works closely with the "Planning Advisor" (a new position in the proposed State Department) to determine the effectiveness of actions taken in foreign policy. The Commission said, "The misconceptions of the Intelligence Bureau must be eliminated," and the person in charge "should train some people with excellent analytical and judgment abilities to be responsible, so that they can review all intelligence within the Bureau."</p>
<h3>Bolivian Cabinet Resigns En Masse</h3>

<h3>Advocates for US-Soviet Understanding at Meeting of Soviet Jews</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Newark, New Jersey, 21st] US Progressive Party leader Henry Wallace gave a speech to the Committee of Soviet Jews in this city on the 21st, saying that Israelis can benefit Arabs by using modern agricultural methods, just as the Jewish Autonomous Region in the Soviet Far East can benefit the Chinese in Northeast China by using the same methods. The purpose of the Committee of Soviet Jews in the United States includes raising funds and transferring agricultural equipment to the Jewish residents of the Jewish Autonomous Region in the Soviet Union. Wallace also believed that Jews in Israel and in the Jewish Autonomous Region in the Far East can serve as liaison between the British, American, and Slavic nations. He also said that US-Soviet understanding is still an urgent problem to be solved.</p>
<h3>Washington's Birthday: United Nations Takes a Day Off</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] The United Nations is closed today in commemoration of the birthday of the Founding Father of the United States, George Washington. The Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and the Trusteeship Council have not met.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters Changes Policy Toward Japan: Tightens Aid to Promote Japan's Economic Recovery; US Authorities Are Drafting Concrete Plans</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] Following the resignation of US Undersecretary of the Army Draper, MacArthur Headquarters' policy toward Japan has also begun to change. MacArthur Headquarters announced that the previous policy of material assistance to Japan by the US occupying forces will be changed from generous to tight.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] An authoritative source recently told a Central News Agency reporter that the issue of Japan's democratization, which the Allied countries can guarantee will be completed in the occupation policy, has now been relegated to a secondary position. Whether Japan will become a democratic country is no longer the main concern of the occupying authorities. Their sincerity in promoting social reform in Japan will also gradually weaken. The only important occupation policy at present is to assist Japan's economic recovery so that Japan is no longer a burden on American taxpayers. The US policy in Japan is divided into three stages: (1) Japan's demilitarization; (2) Japan's democratization; (3) Economic recovery. Japan's demilitarization is almost complete, but the psychological disarmament of Japan cannot be measured to what extent it has been completed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Authoritative sources said today that senior US authorities are actively drafting plans to determine the final policy on Japan's reparations and the limits of Japan's industry, but no resolution has yet been reached, so it will not be announced for the time being. At the same time, the Far Eastern Commission hopes that the United States will submit the plan to the Council and not directly instruct MacArthur. Collective action is better than individual action on such issues.</p>
<h3>MacArthur and Royal: Female Writer Smedley Reveals</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 21st] The Far East spy report of MacArthur Headquarters involved female writer Agnes Smedley. Smedley threatened to sue MacArthur for defamation, and said: "MacArthur and Secretary of the Army Royal disagreed on the entire policy toward Japan, resulting in a secret struggle that caused me to suffer."</p>
<h3>Ashida and Inukai: Singing a Double Act</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The Ashida faction of the Japanese Democratic Party held a joint meeting of the final committee and the general affairs meeting on the 21st. During the meeting, Tokutaro Kitamura said: "Our position is very pure. The Inukai faction is starting from impure motives and is now shouting that the party convention is invalid, while we will reconfirm our path in the party convention." On the other hand, the Inukai faction also convened a general affairs meeting on the same day. Secretary-General Yasuri explained that he did not recognize the party convention convened by the Ashida faction, saying: "Since the establishment of the Yoshida Cabinet, the Democratic Party has invited the opposition between the cabinet and the opposition. In fact, there is no ideological difference between the two factions, only differences of opinion on the timing of joining the government. The crisis that is now causing the split is due to a conspiracy to exclude the new President Inukai. The party convention to be convened by the Ruan faction should be considered invalid. Only President Inukai, who was unanimously elected at last year's party convention, has the authority to convene a party convention. It is very clear."</p>
<h3>Philippine Senate Split: Speaker's Reinstatement Hopeless</h3>
<p>President Quirino Supports the Decision</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 22nd] The Philippine Senate split yesterday, senators used force, and Speaker Averino led ten Liberal Party senators to walk out. A minority of twelve Liberal Party senators met separately, unanimously voted to remove Speaker Azarino, elected Guen Gu as Speaker, and decided to investigate Azarino's fraudulent acts. President Quirino has recognized this move as legal. Azarino refused to give in. The senators who supported Azarino jointly announced last night that they would no longer attend Senate meetings pending Azarino's reinstatement, but the anti-Azarino faction and the pro-Azarino faction have become a ratio of twelve to eleven. Azarino is afraid that there is no hope of reinstatement. This stalemate will probably be decided by the Supreme Court. The background of the Senate split is Averino's and Quirino's competition for control of the Liberal Party in order to obtain the party's presidential candidate qualification.</p>
<h3>US Democratic Party Lacks Leadership: Fails to Control New Congress; Various Legislations Encounter Resistance</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The new Democratic Congress began its eighth week on the 21st, and President Truman's legislative proposals have fallen into a political quagmire. Except for the Reciprocal Trade Act, which has passed the House of Representatives, the main items on the legislative agenda have not been enacted. On major issues such as the abolition of the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, new taxes, and higher minimum wages, Truman must accept compromises, even though he is unwilling. The opportunity for Congress to vote to give Truman the power to control wages and prices is dimming. The government's plan to support agricultural prices is still under study and has not been submitted to Congress. After careful explanation, Truman's medical insurance plan has been met with increasing opposition. Various large organizations that helped the Democratic Party win the election last year have begun to complain about the lack of leadership in the Senate. There have also been attacks on Truman himself from the left. The New Republic magazine said that if Truman fails to stimulate Congress to take action to achieve the goals of the Democratic Party, he will evade his responsibility as the leader of the United States.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Munich, 21st] During the trial of five spies on the 21st, a document stated that the United States has a total of 600 atomic bombs, and one has been lost in the United States. German police officer Storm said that he found the document in 25 documents found in a woman's handbag carried by a Polish refugee, Starozai. Starozai and four other Germans are currently accused of espionage in the US-occupied zone of Germany. During the interrogation, the five people all claimed to be innocent.

<p>Pacific Trust Islands to be Discussed Next Week</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] The United Nations Security Council's rotating chairman for February, Chinese representative Jiang Tingzhen, yesterday shelved the Soviet proposal to appoint Faruki Ge, the former Swedish ambassador to the Soviet Union, as the governor of the Trust Territory.

<h3>The UN Requests Soviet Assistance to Complete the Reunification of North and South Korea so that the Korean Committee Can Contact the North Korean Regime</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 21st] It was revealed on the 21st that the United Nations has requested Soviet assistance to facilitate contact between the North Korean government, supported by the Soviet Union, and the United Nations, to achieve the unification of all of Korea. UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie has delivered to Soviet representative Malik the notification to the chairman of the Korean Committee, Australian representative Hodgson, currently in Seoul. This Korean Committee was established last December to "assist in mediating the achievement of Korean unification and complete independence." Hodgson reported on February 9 that the committee had formed a subcommittee to "immediately contact North Korea, so that the committee's personnel can visit North Korea to find ways to eliminate obstacles between North and South Korea.

Iran and Pakistan may also be included.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Expanding the National Police Force will be Discussed by the Japanese Diet. It is Said that the Tokyo Police Department is Preparing to Equip Armored Vehicles</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The issue of strengthening the Japanese police force, the necessity of which was stated by Prime Minister Yoshida at the time of his second cabinet formation, has gradually become a problem with the possibility of being realized. It is feared that this issue will also be formally discussed in the current Diet session. The focus of this issue lies in: regarding increasing personnel, there are two opinions: one advocating increasing the current fixed number of 125,000 personnel to 150,000, and the other suggesting establishing 150,000 police units separately.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 22nd] According to a Japanese newspaper report on the 22nd, the police force in the Tokyo area will be greatly increased. Each of the 73 police stations scattered in the Tokyo area will be equipped with ten armored vehicles and one jeep. The plan also advocates dividing Tokyo into five "defense" zones, in each of which a fully equipped motorized police unit will be prepared to deal with "any emergency," including mob riots and any Communist-incited disturbances. Due to the Washington's Birthday holiday, reporters could not immediately confirm or deny this news from the responsible officials of the Allied General Headquarters. In any case, any Japanese plans of this nature must be submitted to the Allied General Headquarters for review and final approval.</p>
<h3>If the Communists Control Japan, the Soviets Will Sweep Across the Pacific</h3>
<p>Acheson Expresses Views to Reporters</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Former Commander of the U.S. Occupation Army Eighth Army in Japan, Lieutenant General Eichelberger, said on the 21st: If the Communists control Japan, the Soviet-led Japanese army may sweep across the Pacific in a few years. Eichelberger said in an interview with United Press International reporters: "Regardless of how others see the strategic value of Japan, the Communists fully understand this, and they will pay any price to occupy Japan." Eichelberger, recalling that Japan once "knocked on Australia's door" in 1942, said: "If the Communists once control Japan, then this is very likely to be re-enacted in a few years." He continued: In his personal opinion, a Communist-controlled Japan will not be an "immediate" military threat because the Soviet navy is weak and has no amphibious warfare experience, but if the Soviet Union can coordinate the raw materials of the Northeast and the industrial potential of Japan, then this obstacle can be quickly overcome.</p>
<h3>British Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference Will be Held in Ottawa</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 22nd] Authoritative sources predicted on the 22nd that the location of the proposed Commonwealth Foreign Ministers' Conference in May of this year will be changed from Colombo, Ceylon, to Ottawa. It is said that senior commissioners of the Commonwealth countries discussed this change during a meeting with the Minister of Commonwealth Relations, Bagg, last week. It was pointed out that most of the Commonwealth representatives participating in this conference will first attend the UN General Assembly meeting in Lake Success, so Ottawa, Canada, will be a more convenient location.</p>

<h3>Mysterious Missiles Fly into the US-Occupied Zone of Germany</h3>
<p>Experts are Confused and Cannot Understand</p>
<p>[United Press International, Frankfurt, 22nd] US authorities in Germany disclosed today that since October 1946, four mysterious missiles have fallen in the US-occupied zone of Germany, apparently rockets or jet-propelled objects. According to technical experts, they are still studying the fragments of the last missile, which fell on the northeastern corner of Bavaria on the 31st of last month. It is said that the four missiles all fell in the same area east of Schweinfurt, about 35 miles from the Soviet-occupied zone. The crater of the last missile was ten feet deep and seven feet wide, and it is said that the missile trailed a luminous tail as long as twenty feet. Officials pointed out that if the rockets were launched from the Soviet zone, their accuracy would be incredible, since the area where the four missiles fell was so small, so they are very puzzled.</p>
<h3>United States of Africa Under Planning</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 21st] According to the Colonial Office news on the 21st, which is studying the proposal for a Central African Federation, the United States of Africa, which includes the African territories of the Western European Union, will eventually be established.

<h3>Supervisory Committee Investigates Cases such as the National Bank's Gold and Silver Transfer to the South, Liu Zhe Believes There is Solid Evidence of Embezzlement of Relief Funds for the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Supervisory Committee's Su-Zhe Regional Office of the Control Yuan is currently conducting investigations into the following cases: (1) The case of the Central Bank's transfer of gold and silver to the south. Committee member Ni Bi had previously made a preliminary investigation by visiting President Liu, but due to time constraints, he was unable to read the official documents and could not know the date and quantity of the transfer, so he plans to conduct a further investigation in the near future. (2) The issue of Northeast material disposal is being investigated by Vice President Liu Zhe. (3) The Liu Weichi case is being investigated by Committee members Yu Peihou and He Jiwei. In addition, the sale of Sun Ke's residence on Columbia Road and the Lanny's materials case are also in the planned work schedule.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] When the Northeast Material Clearance Committee distributed relief funds for Northeast refugees in Shanghai earlier this month, it caused serious disturbances. The Control Yuan paid special attention to this. At the 35th meeting of the Yuan on the 15th, Vice President Liu Zhe, Committee members He Jizhou, and Chen Yushan and others raised cases of embezzlement of loans by the committee, looting of funds by rioters, and the committee using outsiders to distribute large sums of money to non-Northeast refugees under false pretenses. A decision was made to send personnel to investigate. Vice President Liu Zhe, Committee members He Jizhou, Chen Yushan, Zhang Jianzhong, Yu Peihou, Liu Xingzhi, Wang Shulin, and Ni Bi were responsible for conducting a thorough investigation. This reporter visited Vice President Liu, who is currently residing in Shanghai, yesterday to inquire about the development of this matter. According to him, the committee members have collected all the information on this case from all aspects. They believe that the embezzlement and looting are well-documented. For example, the committee had announced that Northeast inventor Xi Guanghou had received 450,000 yuan in relief funds, but it was found that Xi did not receive a penny and starved to death in Shanghai, and there was no money for his burial. Furthermore, it was found that a certain leader in Taicang had detained three "representatives," and it was found that these three representatives were not from the Northeast, which proves that the so-called "refugees" who received the relief funds were undoubtedly impostors. They decided to formally start investigating this case at the Supervisory Committee's office at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 24th). The persons in charge of each loan who mishandled the case and the heads of the relevant agencies will be formally summoned at that time. According to Vice President Liu, in addition to focusing on the embezzlement of loans and looting by rioters, the investigation will also deny the rumors that a certain leader in Taicang distributed funds under false pretenses. He expressed deep dissatisfaction with the previous measures taken by a certain leader in Taicang.</p>
<h3>New Silver Coins to be Minted Order Has Not Yet Arrived A Batch of Silver Allocated to the Mint</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the eve of the formal promulgation of the new economic plan, the saying that silver coins would be re-issued has been confirmed by the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank. It is rumored that the new silver coins have already started to be minted. This reporter made a special inquiry to the Central Mint in this city yesterday. According to the person in charge of the mint, the mint has not received any orders regarding the minting of new silver coins to this day. As for the resumption of work in the mint, it has been going on unremittingly for three years. Recently, eight printing machines have been transported from Kunming and are currently being actively installed. Among them, four large machines are specifically used for printing patterns on silver coins. There was originally only one such machine in the mint. Once the four newly arrived machines are installed, tens of thousands of silver coins can be minted every day. It is rumored that the model of the new silver coin is based on the "boat dollar" minted in 1934, but the mint has not heard of this. However, the steel mold for the "boat dollar" is indeed readily available, complete, and preserved in the mint. If the Ministry of Finance sends an order to mint this silver coin, work can begin immediately without the need for further preparation.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Central Bank has allocated a batch of its silver reserves to the Central Mint to mint new silver dollars. The mint has also decided to start smelting and minting next month. This news has been confirmed by the mint director Wei. Wei also said: Based on the mint's current financial and material resources, once minting begins, the daily output can be more than 500,000 coins. According to reliable sources, the Central Bank authorities will put the silver coins minted in 1934 from its current reserves on the market before the new silver coins are minted after the new financial and economic plan is announced.</p>
<h3>Wu Guozhen Appointed Chairman of the Military-Civilian Cooperation Committee</h3>

<h3>Xu Xueyu Appointed Chairman of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Xu Xueyu, General Manager, firmly requested to resign, and the Ministry of Communications has approved their resignations and re-appointed Xu Xueyu as the Chairman of the company. The position of General Manager, which was vacated, is currently being selected by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Food Coupons to be Distributed at the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>According to news from the Civil Affairs Office, the rice distribution coupons for the households in this city for March have all been printed and will be collected and distributed by each district on February 27th and 28th. The rice supply has also been adequately prepared. It is rumored that a portion of flour will also be distributed in March, and the quality of this American flour is quite good.</p>
<h3>Land Administration Bureau Urges Payment of Land Value Tax Penalty for Late Payment to be Increased</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The land value tax for this city this year will still be collected in two installments as in previous years. The first installment started on January 26th. The Land Administration Bureau issued approximately 170,000 payment notices, stipulating that property owners must pay within one month after receiving the notice. The total tax revenue budget is approximately 400 million, which originally accounted for more than 60% of the municipal government's revenue, but due to currency fluctuations, it now only accounts for approximately 30%. The land value tax rate is 15 per thousand of the standard land price. This year, the Municipal Council has approved an additional 5 per thousand for a self-defense donation, which is collected in full in the first installment. The areas where land value tax is collected include the Huangpu, Hunan, Fahua, Zhabei, Yinliu, and Caojing land registries. This year, the Tangqiao district has been added. Among them, the Huangpu district is the most prosperous commercial area, and its tax revenue accounts for more than 70% of the total.</p>
<p>The land value tax this year was initially a heavy burden for property owners, but due to drastic currency fluctuations, the value of the same amount of money is now different from before. The city treasury is currently tight, and the Land Administration Bureau hopes that all property owners can understand the difficulties of the municipal government and pay enthusiastically. According to past practice, most property owners want to delay payment until a few days before the deadline. These short days are the "peak season" for land value tax collection. This year's peak season for the first installment is approaching. In order to encourage citizens to pay on time and because the original regulations stipulated that a late payment penalty of only 15% would be added after one month, which is lower than the monthly interest rate, and is unreasonable, the Land Administration Bureau is currently drafting measures to strengthen the collection and penalties for late payment, increase the penalty rate, and submit them to the municipal government for approval for implementation in the short term.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of Rising Sun Building Drainage Project Progressing Rapidly</h3>
<p>The second phase of the Rising Sun Building relief drainage project in this city has been progressing rapidly since construction began. According to Zhou Shutao, director of the First District Works Management Office of the Engineering and Tax Bureau, the second phase of the project includes 240 meters of pipes, 80 centimeters in diameter, and 3 meters deep. It is being carried out actively by the Works Bureau's regular workers and is the largest self-construction project of the Works Bureau in the past three years. The workers are skilled in the drainage project and the progress is still satisfactory. It is expected to be completed in 60 clear days (approximately early May).</p>
<h3>To Facilitate Legislators Going to Nanjing for Registration, Special Sleeper Cars Will be Provided Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The third session of the Legislative Yuan has been scheduled to begin the registration procedures for legislators in Nanjing from the 21st. In order to facilitate the attendance of legislators from Shanghai and Hangzhou, the Secretariat of the Yuan has arranged with the two railway bureaus to attach special sleeper cars to the 11:00 p.m. trains to Nanjing from the Shanghai North Railway Station on the 23rd and 24th. The special car from Hangzhou to Shanghai will be attached to the West Lake train at 4:05 p.m. on the 24th and will arrive at the Shanghai North Station at 8:05 p.m. on the same evening, and then transfer to the night sleeper car to Nanjing on the same day.

<h3>Silver Dollar Trader Declared Not Guilty Due to Lack of Explicit Punishment in the Law</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Silver dollar trader Chen Xinchang was found by police officers on the morning of December 31 last year at the intersection of Jinling East Road and Henan Road to have purchased 23 silver dollars at the black market price of 70 yuan and 80 yuan in gold yuan notes per silver dollar. He was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecuted on suspicion of harming the national currency. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Yingqiao of the District Court announced that Chen Xinchang was not guilty. The reasons for the judgment stated: The Regulations for the Punishment of Crimes Harming the National Currency do not explicitly stipulate that the act of privately transporting and selling silver coins and copper coins in the inland should be punished, so it cannot be punished according to the regulations. The Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 4052 has a record of this case. The defendant in this case should be found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Silver Dollar Deposit, Cotton Mill Manager Accused</h3>
<p>In February of the 17th year of the Republic of China, a widow, Chen Zuo, deposited 1,513 silver dollars into the Dasheng Cotton Mill for an indefinite period. When the war broke out, the mill was temporarily closed, so Chen was unable to withdraw the money. After the victory, the mill resumed operations, and Zuo negotiated with the mill. The mill initially agreed to repay the money based on the cost of living index at the time, but shortly after the currency system was reformed, the mill suddenly reneged on the agreement. Therefore, Chen Zuo had no choice but to file a lawsuit against Zhang Jingli, the manager of the mill, in the District Court. Yesterday, the case was heard by Judge Zhang Yicai of the District Court. Zuo requested the court to order the defendant to repay 5,500 silver dollars. As a result, the court ordered the case to be adjourned for investigation and then heard again.</p>
<h3>Manager and Deputy Manager of Cooperative Sentenced to Imprisonment for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Tian Yaozhou, the manager of the Hongkou Branch of the Municipal Mortgage Credit Cooperative, and Xie Jiashui, the deputy manager, were engaged in managing deposits and loans for cooperative members. However, due to poor business operations, they also engaged in other businesses, which also failed. Therefore, they withdrew the deposits of cooperative members and closed the branch on the afternoon of December 7, 1948, causing the cooperative members to be unable to withdraw their money. The cooperative member Chen Changzhi and others reported the case to the Hongkou Police Branch, which arrested Tian and others and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Huaping concluded the trial and announced the judgment: Tian Yaozhou and Xie Jiashui colluded and intended to illegally own the items held in their possession in their business, and were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment and a fine of 3,000 yuan. If they are unable to pay the fine, they will be required to perform labor in lieu of payment, with the amount of the fine converted into the number of days of labor at a ratio of six months.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Communist Postal Items Arrive Letters from Xuzhou and Bengbu Received in this City</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It was recently learned from the Municipal Postal Administration that the postal bags sent from Suhu to Nanjing on the 20th of this month contained approximately hundreds of letters originating from Xuzhou, Bengbu, and Suxian, and sent to various places in Nanjing and Shanghai, as well as a small number of letters from North Korea and Northeast China. These letters were all neatly bundled into small bundles and had Communist area stamps affixed to them. The stamps from Central China had an image of a train locomotive, with patterns on both sides and a face value of one yuan, overprinted with "revised to two hundred yuan" and the six characters "Suwan Border Region Post Office," and stamped with "Central China Liberated Area." The Bengbu Post Office stamped the date on the stamps. The back of the letter also had a rectangular rubber stamp with four lines of characters: "Bengbu Liberation Commemoration, Mail Delivery Restored, Build People's Post Office, Rapid, Accurate, and Universal." The post office guessed that these letters seemed to have been sent from Hefei and transferred to Nanjing via Wuhu. They are currently inquiring with the Wuhu Bureau to find out the details. If the guess is correct, then in the future, mail sent from Nanjing and Shanghai to the above-mentioned areas can be tried to be transferred via Wuhu.</p>
<h3>Educational Fellows from Xiangyang Stationed in Shanghai Public Banquet for University Presidents</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Fellowship Association of Educational Fellows Stationed in Shanghai held a public banquet for university presidents and the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau from 6:00 to 9:00 p.m. on the 21st. Those who attended included Zhang Yisan from Fudan University, Ou Yuanhuai from Daxia University, Zhu Guozhang from the Business College, Mao Ruli from Guanghua University, Chen Heqin from the Kindergarten Teachers College, the President of the Music College, Xia Shuyu from the Senior Vocational School, and Li Ximou, the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and more than ten other people. Cheng Shisheng, a representative of the Educational Department fellows, gave a speech, hoping to get assistance with the work of the fellows and find a way to solve the accommodation problem. Wan Shaozhang reported on the situation of the Educational Department fellows being assigned to affiliated agencies in Shanghai. Chen Heqin said that many young students who have moved to Shanghai are out of school. If we can imitate the methods of using space and time in Europe, America, and the Soviet Union to provide more education, for example, if each school only has one class a day, we can open three classes in the morning, afternoon, and evening. This will both accommodate educational personnel and provide relief to those who are out of school, which is a win-win situation. Wang Zhizhuo, the president of Jiaotong University, gave a reply on behalf of the attendees, and promised to help as much as possible with the task of assisting with work and accommodation problems.</p>
<h3>Two Railway Lines May Suspend Operations Revenue Cannot Cover Coal Costs Coal Reserves Only Enough to Last Three Days</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to very reliable sources, the current coal reserves for the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines can only last until the 25th of this month at most. If the coal supply cannot be replenished within these three days, then the trains on the two railway lines may suspend operations due to the lack of coal, following the example of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line. It is understood that the coal problem is also the economic problem of the entire railway bureau, as well as the problem of social economy and people's purchasing power. Since January of this year, the price of coal has been rising every day. Currently, imported coal costs 57,821 yuan per ton, and Taiwanese coal costs 39,470 yuan per ton. The two railway lines use 800 tons of coal per day, requiring an average of approximately 36 million yuan, while the total daily revenue of the two lines is only more than 30 million yuan (the average revenue after adjusting fares), which is not enough to cover the cost of coal, let alone improve the treatment of employees. It is impossible to cut costs, and it is also difficult to increase revenue, because the number of formal passengers has suddenly decreased since the fare adjustment on the 12th of this month. Although the freight rate has increased fivefold, the revenue has not even increased twofold. This is a major crisis facing the railway bureau.</p>
<h3>Dense Fog Still Prevails Yesterday, Sea and Air Traffic Still Obstructed</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The weather in this city remained gloomy and hazy yesterday. In the afternoon, the dense fog increased unabatedly, obstructing sea and air traffic. The Longhua Observatory predicts that the situation may be difficult to improve today. Also, yesterday's temperature: minimum 7.8 degrees Celsius (48.0 degrees Fahrenheit), maximum 10.2 degrees Celsius (50.4 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>According to China National Aviation Corporation: Yesterday, there was heavy fog all day, and Longhua Airport was closed all day. Visibility and cloud height were mostly zero. All CNAC flights departing from Shanghai were grounded. Only the Hong Kong-Guangdong and Hong Kong-Xiamen routes still had flights to and from. One Sino-American flight arrived in Hong Kong from Guam. According to the company's meteorological department's forecast: the weather may improve this morning, but it may also continue for two or three days without clearing up.</p>
<p>Few Ships Entered or Left</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the fog was dense all day, and all ships on the river and sea were suspended. Only the Jiangkang vessel returned to Shanghai from Chongming. In addition, the US Navy cruiser number 66 arrived in Shanghai at noon and docked at the Yangjingbin Pumi. The Jiangjing, a Shanghai-Ningbo liner of the China Merchants Bureau, suspended its departure the day before due to fog.

<h3>Robbery of Shoe Store Fails, Gun Fired Accidentally Injures Accomplice, Police Bureau Captures Three Criminals in Succession</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, two robbers suddenly entered the Wang Wanxing shoe store at No. 433 Zhoujiazui Road, under the pretext of buying shoes. They entered the inner room, pulled out a pistol, and forced the store owner's wife to hand over money and gold rings on her fingers. The store owner's wife screamed for help when she saw this. The robbers, fearing exposure, immediately fired a shot. Unexpectedly, the bullet accidentally hit the leg of another robber. In a panic, the two robbers fled out the door together. The store owner's wife chased after them and reported to the nearby Jing'an Police Sub-bureau, who reported to the Tilanqiao Sub-bureau. The Tilanqiao Sub-bureau immediately dispatched police cars and rushed to the scene, implementing a blockade and searching one by one. As a result, one of the injured robbers, named Cai Xueben, was arrested. After interrogation, he confessed to the robbery and also confessed that another accomplice was named Li Zhengzhong, who lived in a shanty town without a number on Meizhou Road, Pingliang Road.

<h3>Industry Association Bitterly States the Pros and Cons, Petitions for Abolition of the Import-Export Control Committee, Numerous Obstacles After Implementation of Control, Putting Legitimate Industries in Desperate Situation</h3>
<p>Since the government implemented the import-export control measures, due to improper execution and numerous malpractices, the industrial and commercial sectors have not benefited from it but have suffered from it. Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors in South China and other places have proposed abolishing the import-export control agencies. The Shanghai Industry Association also expressed its support and eagerly expects it. The Import-Export Research Committee was held a few days ago and unanimously responded to the proposal of the South China industrial and commercial sectors. Yesterday, telegrams were sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce, stating that the drawbacks of the import-export control measures implemented over the past two years are as follows: (1) The regulations for managing the production equipment and accessories of the first category of import-export control stipulate that permits are issued for goods arriving within three months. In fact, it takes at least six months to a year for foreign orders to arrive, so very few applicants for expanding equipment and replenishing accessories are approved, crippling industrial development. (2) Most industrial raw materials must rely on foreign imports. However, the regulations for the second category of industrial raw materials under import control stipulate very small quotas, only sufficient for one-tenth or one-twentieth of actual needs, and most of them are given to middlemen, only for speculators to profit from, while the industrial sector is exploited. (3) There are no regulations for applying for waivers for the non-quota items in the third category. Cunning people use their connections, making it a hotbed of black market activity and a shortcut to speculative profits. (4) The foreign exchange earned from exports must be settled with the Central Bank. Due to the difference between the official price and the black market price, few exporters exist. Currently, Hong Kong and Japan are dumping goods in Southeast Asia, and our country's exports cannot compete with them. In summary, whether in adjusting imports, stabilizing the economy, or protecting production, the expected results have not been achieved. However, those that should be restricted or prohibited from import have not been thoroughly done, such as new luxury cars, refrigerators, radios, and various luxury goods, which flood the market. However, the examination of those that must be imported is like giving alms, with numerous obstacles and years of unresolved issues. The quotas for the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth quarters have not yet been completed. The low efficiency of handling is evident from this. The pain and losses suffered by the industrial sector are not insignificant. Therefore, after careful research by the relevant associations of this association, and based on a review of the facts and interests, five suggestions are provided: (1) It is requested that the Import-Export Control Committee be abolished immediately, and all related business should be handled by the customs. (2) In order to increase industrial production, it is necessary to fully obtain the necessary equipment and raw materials. For imports, the import of the first category of production equipment and the second category of industrial raw materials should not be restricted. The types of regulations can be proposed by each industry and submitted by the Industrial Association for revision. (3) For the numerous items listed in the third category appendix, please submit the import quantity to the Technical Committee of this association for detailed research and regulations. (4) Luxury goods and finished products or industrial raw materials that can already be self-sufficient in the country should still be strictly prohibited from import. Do not relax the ban in order to obtain high tax revenue, causing the domestic industry to be hit again. (5) For the foreign exchange earned from the export of industrial finished products, it should be requested that 100% be handed over to the factory to purchase machinery and raw materials abroad, so as to expand or improve equipment and increase production efficiency.</p>
<h3>Shenbao "Scholarship Fund" Launches Emergency Fundraising, Continues to Solicit 250 Shi of Rice, Aiming to Complete in a Short Period of Time</h3>
<p>The "Reader Scholarship Fund" sponsored by Taibao, after receiving a generous donation of one million yuan from Mr. "Mo Xuming" the day before, has received donations of about 250 shi of rice before and after. It is estimated that it can help 216 middle and high school students. Although this number is close to the intended goal, it is still far behind the number of poor students who have applied for help in the past few days. The newspaper advocates the scholarship fund, and should provide universal assistance to poor students. Therefore, it has been decided to continue the emergency fundraising, hoping to raise 500 shi of rice. In other words, starting from today, another 250 shi will be raised. In addition to Mr. "Mo Xuming" generously promising to raise funds, the solicitation will be expanded further, hoping that knowledgeable people and industry and commerce giants in this city will actively donate, and strive to complete the goal in the shortest possible time. Not only are countless poor students eagerly waiting, but also the colleagues of this newspaper are very excited.</p>

According to a boatman in the river who witnessed the incident, he caught sight of two soldiers, one running wildly and the other chasing closely, both running towards the river. Then, the former was caught up and held back, and they were twisted into a ball. Because both sides were soldiers, it was inconvenient to step forward to mediate, so he chose to enter the cabin. After a while, he suddenly heard a soldier calling for help, and then there was no sound. Later, he poked his head out to look at the shore and found a corpse on the riverbank, etc. Afterwards, a soldier told someone that the deceased was a deserter who was strangled to death by his superiors after being discovered.

<h3>Soaring Costs and Difficult Distribution, Book Industry Association Holds Emergency Meeting, Decides to Request Relief from Relevant Authorities</h3>
<p>Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the publishing industry in this city has suffered from the impact of the war, blocked transportation, difficult distribution of new books, and soaring printing and binding costs. The price of new books is less than half of the cost, and the weakness of readers' purchasing power is particularly prominent. The book scarcity is even more unforgivable by the society.

Therefore, the Book Industry Association convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday (the 22nd) to discuss countermeasures. Resolutions were made: (1) Please the relevant departments of the government to provide relief quickly. (2) Please the Central Bank provide loans in accordance with the loan regulations for each industry to order raw materials.

<h3>Introducing Modern British Drama, British Cultural Committee's Last Lecture Today</h3>
<p>Professor Wiley of Fudan University gave the second lecture on British drama at the British Cultural Committee lecture held at the Lester Institute of Technology on the evening of the 21st, describing British drama in the 17th and 18th centuries. Professor Wiley said that the atmosphere of protecting the theater during that period was opened by King Charles II of England, because he was very interested in drama.

The biggest change that occurred in the theater at that time was that after artificial lighting was applied to the theater, the theater had become a place for court nobles to feast, and the hobbies of ordinary people were neither understood nor cared about.</p>
<p>The last academic lecture of the English Committee is scheduled to be held at the Lester Institute of Technology tonight (Wednesday) at 7:30 p.m. Mr. Mandy will speak on modern British drama.</p>

The number of people going to the Four Banks and One Bureau to subscribe decreased even further than before, with a total of 246 taels sold.</p>
<h3>Another Eight Firms Approved to Use Funds from the Xie Zi Bank Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Gold Control Bureau continued to receive 53 applications from firms requesting to use the cash deposited for increased capital. Yesterday morning, the bureau held its 14th review meeting with the audit office of the Guohang Business Bureau, reviewing each case one by one. In addition to the first and second batches of applications for rollover, eight new firms were approved to use funds, totaling approximately 2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Slight Improvement in Money Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the money market saw a slight improvement due to significant advances by banks and bureaus the day before, with small exchanges exceeding 1.2 billion yuan. The supply of funds became scarcer, with internal supplies decreasing and turnover becoming more frequent. Interest rates on loans peaked at 80 yuan, but generally stood at 70 yuan. General observations suggest that if the government decides to release gold and silver to recover gold yuan currency, the money market will become extremely tight. Due to the bank's search the night before and the submission to the Central Bank for offsetting, cash funds were exhausted again yesterday. Small banks had no cash for delivery, and promissory notes became popular again, with discounts rising to 8 yuan.</p>
<p>The money market around the end of this month will experience a period of extreme tightness. Saturday is the 26th, and the 28th is the date for the release of the cost of living index, which also coincides with the end of the month. Therefore, this weekend and the beginning of next week may see a sharp tightening. Large market players have recently been lying low. The main reason is that the announcement of the new plan is expected to create pressure. Therefore, prices this week may decline, or at most remain stable.</p>
<h3>Stable Securities Market, Tainan Sugar Rises to Limit Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the stock exchange was calm and sluggish, with a dull appearance and a slight decline. The entire session was initially tight and then softened. The initial openings were all at high prices, but the mid-session was mixed and falling. Before closing, there was a struggle to stabilize. State-owned Taity Sugar consistently reported gains, first reaching the limit and then breaking it before returning to the limit. It rose by 1,210 yuan compared to the previous day, and the transaction volume also doubled, reaching 1,110 shares. Private-sector Yongs yarn rose from 2.17 yuan to 2.38 yuan, then hovered at 2.3 yuan for a long time before falling to 2.1 yuan near noon. It quickly stabilized and rebounded, closing at 2.2 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day, with trading slightly less than the previous day. Other stocks, such as Xin Ya and Rong Feng, both reached their limits in the morning session, with trading volumes of approximately 1-2 million shares each. Zhenqi Datong called for a buy at the limit, but no transactions occurred. China-France first opened at a price of three jiao and five fen, with the asking price in units of one share and the transaction volume in units of 100,000 shares. Compared to the previous day, Datong, Rong Feng, Jing Lun, Qin Xing, and Xin Ya all rose by half a fen to one jiao and two fen, while Xin He, Tong Yi, Xin Guang, Mei Ya, Match, Hua Feng, Business, Zhabei, and Yong Gong all fell by one fen to two jiao. The total trading volume of all stocks reached 2.2 billion shares.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Show Overall Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, yarn and cloth showed weakness from the beginning. The reason for this was that customers were not clearing goods smoothly. Although local merchants were taking deliveries, the quantity was very small. In addition, before the new economic plan is announced, most buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Small investors in the market were pressured by interest rates and were unwilling to hold on, selling at higher prices. As a result, all yarns tended to soften.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fell from 580,000 yuan to close at 570,000 yuan, a drop of 80,000 yuan from the previous day. Other yarns, such as Tiannv and Bao Guang, also loosened. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell by 80,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon was initially at 480,000 yuan, but gradually decreased to 440,000 yuan, a drop of 65,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse appeared, initially opening at 350,000 yuan, falling to 320,000 yuan in the middle, and recovering to 335,000 yuan at noon, a drop of 35,000 yuan from the previous day. Overnight, it was offered at 352,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse fell by a small amount of 25,000 yuan, closing at 315,000 yuan. 16-count Guangming retreated into the 300,000 yuan range, at 280,000 yuan. Other yarns also showed small declines.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market turned weak, because the volume of business from local shops was mediocre, and customers had no intention of making any moves. Trading in the market was slack, and it was difficult to see any improvement in the weary situation in the short term. The leading fine cloth was initially bid at 15,500 yuan outside the market, and at noon it was heard that a small amount was traded at 15,200 yuan, a drop of 1,800 yuan from the previous day. Trumpet Boy fine cloth fell all the way from 13,250 yuan to close at 12,900 yuan, a drop of 1,400 yuan. B-grade leading fine cloth fell by 1,550 yuan, closing at 12,750 yuan. In addition, Big Double Dragon and Three Peach fine cloth also followed the downstream trend. Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 13,700 yuan, once rose to 13,900 yuan, and then retreated to 13,300 yuan, a drop of 1,700 yuan from the previous day. Golden Lotus and Wonderful Dance Serge fell by 1,800 yuan. Although factory prices for other colored cloths and floral cloths did not decline, there were few buyers, and the business of dyeing and weaving factories saw a sharp decline.</p>

<h3>Woolen Fabric Price Increase Six to Seven Times Higher Than at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>Due to various environmental factors, since the New Year's opening, the price of woolen fabrics has been rising step by step. Compared to the price at the end of last year, the average overall increase is six to seven times. Compared with other commodity prices abroad, the rate of increase is still limited, and most of them are even going in the opposite direction.

Although black market interest rates were low, actual sales were minimal.

At noon, next-day cash was trading at 515,000 yuan.</p>

As a result, the market turned into a hovering situation, with no difference from before.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation, Parents Made a Marriage Agreement When the Person Was Young, The Party Can Apply for Rescission</h3>
<p>Compensation for Losses Can Be Claimed if the Other Party is Not at Fault</p>
<p>Zhang Xinmin asks: Miss A is now 26 years old. When she was three years old, her parents made a marriage agreement with Mr. B. After Miss A reached adulthood, she did not recognize this marriage agreement. Now the original matchmaker has died, and Miss A is in love with Mr. C, but Mr. B is unwilling to give up the marriage agreement. Question: (1) Is it legal for Miss A to marry Mr. C? (2) If Miss A only publishes a formal denial notice in her hometown newspaper, can it be regarded that the previous marriage agreement has become invalid? (3) If Miss A formally notifies Mr. B through a witness (such as a lawyer) declaring denial, and Mr. B refuses to answer or even expresses unwillingness, is it illegal for Miss A to marry Mr. C immediately? (4) Does Mr. B have the right to demand compensation for losses from Miss A or Mr. C? (5) Is there a time limit? (6) Does Mr. C bear any legal responsibility in this matter?</p>
<p>[Mr. Tang Mingshi answers] (1) If Miss A wants to make another marriage agreement with Mr. C, she must rescind the marriage agreement with Mr. B. (2) The procedure for rescinding a marriage agreement must be determined according to the circumstances. In this case, although Miss A has not admitted the agreement, it is also said that she has not denied it. Are there other circumstances sufficient to prove that she did not deny it and is waiting for marriage? Therefore, publishing in the newspaper is a procedure, but publishing in the newspaper does not make the marriage agreement invalid. (3) Hiring a lawyer to handle the procedures is the correct approach. The entire circumstances should be discussed in detail with the lawyer, and the previous marriage agreement should be rescinded before another marriage can be made. Do not act rashly to avoid causing trouble. (4) If the other party to the previous marriage agreement is not at fault, they can of course demand compensation for losses. (5) If a marriage agreement is made by parents on behalf of a minor, those who cannot agree should express it when they reach adulthood. After reaching adulthood, if there is no expression, it must be determined according to the circumstances. Therefore, time is indeed a problem. (6) If Mr. C is not aware of the situation, he will not be held responsible.</p>
