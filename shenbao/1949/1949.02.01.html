<p>〔本報南京卅一日電〕李代總統卅一日晨偕邱昌渭。黃雪邨等專機飛滬，邵力子應邀同行，並即於在滬公畢後暮色蒼茫中冒雨霧返京。立法院院長童冠賢等同來，邵老將留滬一日，定一日午後搭民航機返京，傳聞邵老或將先行飛平。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕李代總統昨長十時半自京乘「追雲」號專機飛抵滬，邵力子。邱昌渭·程思遠·黃雪邨等同來。李代總統下機後，即驅車赴外灘中國銀行四縷暫憩。十一時許，召見此間社會賢達及各界名流（多屬無黨無派者），包括顏惠卿·章士釗·冷禦秋·陳光甫·江庸等廿餘人，舉行談話會，李氏即席徵取各人對和平之意見，行政院長孫科。副院長鐵城等均均在座，迄中午十二時許，復與各與會人士共進午膳。膳後，李代總統即與孫科·吳鐵城·及留滬各部會首長舉行談話會，至下午三時半，李代總統先行離席，即驅車分訪孫夫人及何應欽等，至四時四十五分復趕至龍華機塲，乘原機於五時許起飛返京，甘介侯·黃雪邨等同返。赴機塲歡送者有吳鐵城·洪蘭友·何成濬·潘公展·吳國楨·陳大慶·楊虎·俞叔平等。李代總統臨去時語記者：「和平決繼續努力推進，政府則已決定遷穗。」</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院各部會首長昨午起在此間外灘中國銀行四樓有軍要會議，出席者除孫院長·吳副院長及各部會首長洪蘭友·徐堪·朱家驊·劉維熾·左舜生·端才愷等十餘人外，李代總統亦與會，中途早退，而政院會議則延至四時廿分始散。會後各首長對會議內容，均諱莫如深。惟悉：政府對中共發言人一月廿八日晚之廣播，已擬就答覆之正式文吿，携京交中央社於昨晚（卅一日）拍發。李代總統並決定推請此間無黨無派之社會領袖顏惠慶·章士釗·冷禦秋·陳光甫·江庸等五人，以私人資格，即飛北平，與中共方面代表接觸，徵詢中共是否願意談判和平，如屬願意，即請指派代表，指定地點，時問，早日進行和談，此外，復對和談之推進及政府遷穗後之各種措施，詳細交換意見。</p>
<p>昨日會議，邵力子並未參加，邵於走廊中為記者羣發現，卽遭包圍，邵氏僅稱：「你們消息比我多，我現在毫無意見發發表」。孫院長會後匆離去，不願發言。徐堪，朱家驊對去京抑去穗，不作肯定答覆。劉攻芸則乾脆稱：「不知道」。吳鐵城走遲一步，遭記者羣包圍，答記者問略稱：「政府決定五日遷穗，我將於五日前去穗。對和平前途的看法，就中共歷次廣播看來，希望很少，然而尙未至絕望地步」。政院秘書長端木愷於跨進電梯時，對記者羣高喊：「政府決定遷都，和平繼續努力」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕何應欽將軍前患痔疾，來滬診治，日前施行割治後，經過甚屬良好，現已由國防醫院遷回林森路私邸調養，預計不日卽可康復如常。據悉：政府方面刻正敦促何氏出任某項要職，日前中央某要人來滬，曾訪何氏於其私邸，傳述政府意見·又，廢曆元旦，漢口白崇　將軍曾來兩次長途電話，對當前大局與何氏有所洽談。京滬杭警備總司令湯恩伯將軍來滬後，亦曾往謁，昨日李代總統蒞滬後，亦與何氏面談頗久。另據可靠方面消息稱：何氏將於康健恢復後，當可出任某項要職。何氏原定二月一日乘輪離滬赴台灣，易地療義，刻經促勸後，業已取消台灣之行，一俟痔瘡收口，日內可能赴京。按：何應欽將軍民國十六年在國府奠都南京，孫傳芳偷渡長江襲攻龍潭時，主持軍機，一戰扭轉危局，造成輝煌偉績，目前共軍正聲言進攻長江南岸，湯總司令此次晋謁，料與江防問題有關。另據某軍事觀察家稱：依照共軍兵力論，渡江實非易事，且國軍在沿江結集兵力相當雄厚，國防部方面業已明白表示，如共軍渡江侵犯，當予抵抗。京滬沿綫為全國精華所在，上海尤為人力物力財力之最大據點，亦可視之為德蘇戰爭時期的史達林格勒云。</p>

<p>〔聯合社廣州卅一日電〕新任粵主席薛岳今日向記者談稱，華南四省準備作為反共最後防綫，不管華北和談結果如何，太人擬領導粵桂湘閩四省人民自衛抗共，不惜殉身，四省之聯合已在規劃中。記者問華南各省單獨作戰是否係對南京政府分裂？薛氏答稱：「吾人正對封建制度與共產主義雙方作戰。余以省主席資格，今後擬從事過去所疏忽之政治與經濟改革。當前之和平努力倘若失敗，蔣氏當捲土重來」。薛氏强調華南四省之單獨立塲。薛氏最後稱，中國之反共鬥爭與美國在太平洋之反共鬥爭現集中於華南各省。目前粵省國防軍人數雖不敵粵省境內六萬武裝分裂份子，但此種奮鬥乃四省之共同努力，並不孤立。</p>

<p>〔本報漢口卅一日電〕武漢沉悶空氣，卅一日頓轉明朗，白總司令於午後三時舉行春節茶話會，向地方父老及民意代表報吿時局動向，白氏首先申述謀和經過稱：各地人民鑒於八年抗戰與三年內亂之慘痛，普遍發出和平呼籲，政府為順納民意，不惜委屆求全，作最大忍讓，以示謀和之虔誠，諸如總統蔣公之元且文吿，其身先引退，李代總統宣布七項措施，幷派定和談代表，承認以八項條件為和談基礎等，均已仁至義盡，事實俱在，但中共至今非僅尙無誠意談和表示，且對津浦隴海·平漢及鄂北荊門當陽等處繼續軍事進攻，致使和平無從順利開展，造成今日之僵局。至此，白氏復以沉靜而堅定之語調宣稱：處此情况下，政府在和平未到絕望時期，決不放棄和平，必當一本初衷，作最大最善之努力，以期尊重民意，實現眞正和平，但若共軍仍進迫不已，戰禍因之縱續，使和平陷於絕望，則其責任誰屬，國人自有公論。談及武漢和平促進會希望武漢不發生戰事一節，白氏從容日，個人亦同此願望，但和平不能求之於一方，各界人士除向政府督促外，同時更須向中共竭力呼籲，請其立卽停戰，然後和平前途方有希望，武漢安寗方能確保。白氏演詞含蓄而明朗，衆皆報以熱烈掌聲。又白氏詞畢，向極緘默之工商各界代表均相繼發言，語多憤懣，人力車夫工會理事趙世斌主張人民應提出共產然的戰犯名單，讓人民公判，商會理事長程子菊希望政府繼續努力和平，如遇阻礙，則願擁護政府實行全面的「和平戰爭」，中大敎授王孟鄰謂，「委屈而不能求全，亦只有弔民伐罪」。民社黨代表張耀先申述和平不能是局部的，必須改革政治，經濟，澈底謀求全面和平。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕政府發言人卅一日對中共廿八日聲明（內容刊第二版），發表答復聲明於次；據陝北廿八日新華社電，中共發言人對政府所提和平意見發表了一個聲明，在該項聲明中，他們提出的意見，歸納起來，大致是：（一）對日本戰犯岡村寗次宣判無罪，表示不能同意。（二）對他們提出的所謂「戰犯」，應由政府先行逮捕，才足以表示政府和平的誠意。（三）對於北平的局部和平工作，政府表示的態度不够鄭重。對於這一個聲明，我們首先感覺到的，也就是熊度上似乎不够「鄭重」，但是我們仍然願意平心靜氣來加以解答：關於岡村寗次一案，是一個司法問題，這完全與和談無關，更不能作為和談的先決條件，政府每天處理的事務很多，如果中共方面像這樣節外生枝，今天提出一項，明天提出一項，那我們不特無以應付，而且變方將因此而無法接近了。其次說到「戰犯」應先行逮捕一點，我們以為，今天雙方旣是要準備進行和談，同時，政府方面又已承認願意以中共所提八項條件為基礎，舉行談判，那麼所有提出來的條件，當然都應該在會議中求解決，決不能先要求執行，然後才舉行會議，如果說條件不必談，便可以執行，試問又何必需要和談，道樣也許會使人民懷疑到共方對和平是否眞有誠意的問題，對於這點，我們不能不深致惋惜，因為眞正的和平，不應該有先決條件，以前我們曾主張先停戰，再談和，共方不也曾以同樣的理由，批評我們，說我們是沒有誠意嗎？，關於第三點，他們沒有提出具體的內容，我們無從答復，總之，我們覺得我們大家—無論是政府方面或中共方面—都應該先有一個正確的基本觀念，就是今天要求和平，是全國人民共同的意旨，我們是為遵循民意來求到以政治方式解決國內糾紛的辦法，必須彼此尊重，彼此忍讓，才能使和談迅沌開始，順利進行。誰要沒有誠意，誰就會受到人民的責難與反對。同時我們希望中共方面要知道，政府方面今天並不是不能再戰，而是不願再戰，不忍再戰。因為今天的國家和人民，實在已經受不起戰爭的迫害與摧殘，如果我們承認革命的目的是為着人民和國家的利益，革命的動機是基於大冬數人民的意旨，那麼在國家人民痛苦到如此地步的今天，全國人民都在要求和平的今天，我們是決沒有要繼續從事戰爭的理由。同時我們應該瞭解，今夭的戰事形勢，雖然共軍在以往幾個月內，打了幾次勝仗，佔領了幾個城市，但是一時的軍事優勢，決不足以決定最後的勝負，而且戰爭也決不能解決問題，這是歷史的敎訓。惟有用政治方式才能解決一切，也惟有大家相忍為國，開誠相見，才能永弭戰禍，永奠和平。至於該發言人所說，你們激怒了人民，人民一致起來反對你們和你們拚命，人民不喜歡你們，你們才反過來求和平，此點原無答辯之必要。但是據我們所知道的，今天在中共區域內的人民，也依舊過着非常痛苦的生活，而且在中共佔領區中的人民和學生，都紛紛的逃向政府區域來，這是一個鐵的事實，關於這一點，我們在此不過順便提一提，決不願因此惹起論辯，好在事實能給我們言明，人民的心裏自有公平的判斷。歸總一句，我們是為着國家和人民來謀取和平之實現，人民都在渴望着和平的到來，我們惟有誠懇的希望中共方面也以最高的誠意來促成和平會議早日召開，使戰爭早日停止，這不僅是政府方面的願望，也就是全國人民的願望。</p>

<h3 id="c17">新春話和平 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>紡春休假，轉瞬巳過。陽光普照，惠風和暢，令人有冬盡春回之感。親友相見，率由舊章，恭喜之聲，洋溢盈耳。但轉念自問，究竟喜從何來？則人人心頭，又莫不以和平在望作自慰慰人之詞。</p>
<p>「和平」一詞，代表着一團和氣，象　着太平景象，原是人人所渴望。果能化干戈為玉帛，消戾氣為祥和，誰不歡迎？可是蔣總統發表元旦文吿，至今巳滿一月，李代總統主持中樞，亦逾旬日，他們兩人的蔪求和平，不僅見之於卑躬屈節的言詞，且更見之於至誠不息的行動。蔣總統旣毅然引退於前，李代總統昨又來滬徵詢社會賢達的意見，要求顏惠慶氏等赴平，探詢中共的眞意，企圖不使和平之門重復堵塞，這都可以看出政府諸公，確能體念人民痛苦之深，盡其求取和平最大之努力。然而，中共方面的反應如何呢？和平是否依然可望而不可即呢？</p>
<p>中共主席毛澤東先生廣播他的八條和談基礎，其內容如何，本報前已論及，李代總統致電毛氏甚且表示願就此八點開始商談，依情理講，祗須中共派定代表，指定地點，和談即可進行，戰火即可停息。詎知一波未平，一波又起，中共的要求顯在得寸進尺之中。「戰犯」名單旣在一批一批的加多，或將永無終止之時，而其所謂「命令」南京的國民政府先行逮捕「戰犯」送交中共審判的要求也一天一天的加苛。在此種情勢下，縱使李代總統是一個有極端「忍辱一修養的人，恐也很難自己前往，負荊請罪。誠然，一個眞能體念人民痛苦的人，如果能斷定他一身受了罰，就可免去人民再受荼毒，也許可以抱着我佛餵虎的犧牲精神，自投虎穴。但這也至少要知道他投了虎口以後，人民畢竟可免於虎患。而今則如何？假使一批一批的所謂「戰犯」，在中共進兵尙未停止以前，在和平未能實現以前，在人民自山生活的權利尙未獲得保證以前，先自肉袒牽羊的迎上前去，而將來人民還是免不了受宰割，受迫害，受妻離子散啼饑號寒之苦，則這種忍辱投降式的和平究竟能造福人民沒有呢？</p>
<p>何况和平，和平，這兩個字是分不開的。不和固不能平，不平也不能和，和與平，平與和，相輔相成，互為因果。我們人民，固無所袒於黨派，但心目中自有一段至公至公的見地。政府諸公以往誠多不肖，但中共亦未必能使國民人人心悅誠服，否則何來成千成萬的難民？往事不談，今天政府與中共，旣同稱為救國救民，「解放」人民，即目前人民最緊要最迫切的一事，就是立刻不打仗，。立刻停戰。惟有停戰，才是「和」的象徵，「和」的開始。政府今已宣示願即停戰，我們人民只須請敎中共：究竟立刻停戰不停戰？停了戰？一切都好談，雙方都好開誠布公的談，都好披肝瀝膽的談。假使說一面願意談和，一面依然進兵，這就未免滑天下之大稽！目下戰事已到了長江沿岸，此正雙方眞為人民，停戰言和最好的機會。政府在蘇北皖北，節節撤兵，步步後退，至少可以說絕無在長江北岸反攻作戰的企圖了。故只要中共不乘此進兵，不再用砲火開釁，則戰事一停，和談之門就可敝開。然而，今後幾天以內中共方面的反應如何呢？他們能否因顏惠慶等幾位老先生的北飛，而對人民的痛苦有所動於中呢？</p>
<p>其次，和平與戰爭是整個的，是一件事之兩面。如整個大局沒有全面和平，則局部和平也是徒然。這道理，很淺顯。因為目前的戰爭，無所謂前後方，有一天戰爭，就有一天戰爭的痛苦生活。北平縱算簽了局部和平的條款，但假使今後沒有全面和平，彼此依然繼續戰爭，北平人民是否可以超然於戰爭之外而度其安閒的生活呢？開封鄭州的「參軍」（即共區之征兵），濟南天津的「淸算」，……這一類共區人民所受戰時生活的味道，北平人不會不噹到的。京滬一帶，還沒有到圍城之日，居然也就有人瞎唱局部和平之說，這不是眞心謀和平，乃是想利用人民的苟安心理，先為中共舖好「受降」之路而已·這叫做掛羊頭賣狗肉的假和平！其實，如果人民眞願投降中共而犧牲共自由生活，倒也罷了，萬一不然，則濫談局部和平之徒，無異要使我們人民飲酖止渴，渴雖止而命不保，勢將後悔英及。所以，我們決不是主戰，我們決定要和平，但所要的是整個的和平，全面的和平，永久的和平，而決不是一地一隅的局部和平，也不是一月半月的暫時和平。</p>
<p>最後，我們還要提醒目前一般為和平呼聲冲昏了頭腦的人們：和平決不是不付代價而可得的。我們人民必須有力量，必須用出我們的力量，示人以不可欺侮，示人以不可征服，我們纔可以獲得眞正的和平。美國新國務卿艾契遜氏說：「凡欲以武力攻擊戚脅吾國家安全者，必將遭遇壓倒之抵抗力量。」今天史太林元帥所以宜稱願與杜魯門總統會晤，討論美蘇間的和平問題者，就因為美國有這種「力量」。推廣來說，蘇聯人民有保衛史太林格勒的力量，英國人民有保衛英倫三島的力量，而後有二次大戰以後英蘇兩國人民所享的和平。故小而言之，上海市民果眞要享有眞正的和平，永久的和平，必須先有保衛大上海的力量。大而言之，國民政府果眞要為人民謀取眞正的和平，永久的和平，興其求之於中共的誠意，不如求之於自己的力量，尤其不如求之於充實江防的力量。假使有力量而不能用，有長江而不能守，還侈談什麼和平呢！</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕參衆兩院聯合對外經濟合作委員會主席麥克倫（民主黨）稱，美國在亞洲採取反共立塲一如在歐洲之所為，此其時矣。美國應以六億至七億元用於對華直接軍事援助，二億至三億元用於平民日用品援助，另撥若干億供其向美國財政部購買白銀，作為穩定基金，以鞏固中國幣制。此種計劃暫時不致向國會提出，日後或將提出。余欲先觀參院外交委員會與國務院對華有何作為。美國援華有若干先決條件，中國政府之改組卽其一，同時中國軍隊，須澈底受美國軍事監察，大約美國將派軍官六百至七百人留華。有人謂派美國軍官團赴華將引起美國對蘇戰爭，余不以為然，蘇聯將官之支援中共，人所共知。被捕中共將官曾承認奉行克里姆林官之命令。本人計劃之經濟部份可併入參院外交委員會二月八日起所將開始討論之新經濟合作法案，軍事援助則為另一問題。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕一月二十六日，政府發言人就促成和平事發表簡短談話，對中共發言人二十五日談話有所答復，認為中共之不卽時指派代表，約定地點，且不停止軍事行動，旨在拖延時間，延長戰禍，因仍重申政府對和平誠意，盼望中共從速指派代表，進行商談，俾和平得以早日實現。頃據新華社二十八日廣播中共發言人長篇聲明，針對政府發言人二十六日談話而發者，聲明首段，强調反對國防部審判戰犯法庭對岡村寗次之判決，繼就其遲運指派和談代表，約定地點理由，有所答辯，並强調立卽逮捕中共所謂「戰爭罪犯」，為和談先決條件。茲將新華社廣播「中共發言人對國民黨反動政府所提和平要求發表聲明」內容，摘錄如下：首謂：據南京中央社二十六日上海電稱：日本戰犯前中國派遺軍總司令官岡村寗次，二十六日由國防部審判戰犯軍事法庭舉行復審後，於下午四時宣布無罪。中共發言人表示，這一個日本戰犯，是中國派遺軍總司令官岡村寗次大將，為日本侵華派遺軍一切戰爭罪犯中的主要戰爭罪犯，今被國民黨反動政府的戰犯軍事法庭宣判無罪，中國共產黨及中國人民解放軍總部聲明：這是不能承認的，我們現在向南京反動政府警吿：「你們應當迅速將岡村寗次逮捕，不得違誤，因為這和你們現在要求我們共同談判的事有密切關係，我們有權命令你們重新逮捕岡村寗次，並依照我們將要通知你們的時間，地點，由你們負責押送人民解放軍，其他日本戰爭罪犯，暫由你們收押，今後處理，一概不得擅自釋放或縱令逃逸，違者嚴懲不貸。」繼稱：</p>
<p>『從南京反動政府發言人元月廿六日的聲明中，表示南京的先生要求和平談判那樣的緊張熱烈，殷勤迫切，而感到中共方面對於接受你們的願望則是這樣的不緊張，不熱烈，不殷勤，不迫切，若不停止戰爭行動，是拖延時間，「延長戰禍」，我們老實吿訴南京先生們，你們是戰爭罪犯，你們是要受審判的人們，你們言中所謂的「和平」「停戰」，我們是不相信的，你們依賴美國勢力，違反人民意志，撕毀停戰協定和政治協商會的決議，發動這次殘酷無比的反人民，反民主，反革命的國內戰爭，那時你們是那樣的緊張熱烈，股勸迫切，千萬人的勸吿也不聽，如今過了兩年半，你們犯了滔天大罪，這筆帳必得算一算，雖說你們很有些反對淸算鬥爭，但是這一項淸算鬥爭，是事出有因的，必須淸一淸，算一算，鬥一鬥，爭一爭，因此你們反過來求和平，你們提出了五條，我們提出了八條，人民立卽擁護我們的八條，不擁護你們的五條，你們不敢批評我們的八條，不敢堅持你們的五條，你們願以我們的八條的談的基礎，這樣難道還不好嗎，為什麼還不快點談呢，於是乎顯得你們很緊張，很熱烈，很殷勸，很迫切，很主張「無條件停戰」，「縮短戰爭時間」，「减輕人民痛苦」，「以拯救人民為前提」，而我們呢，顯然是不緊張，不熱烈，不殷勤，不迫切，「拖延時間，延長戰禍」。但是且慢，南京的先生們，我們會要緊張起來的，會要熱烈起來，殷勤起來，戰爭時間一定可以縮短，人民的痛苦也可以减輕，你們旣然同意以我們的八個條件為雙方談判的基礎，你們會要一齊忙碌起來的實行這八條，說不定叫你們，我們，一切民主黨派人民團體以及全國各地人民忙上幾個月，半年，一年，五年，恐怕還忙不了。我們有權命令你們重新逮捕岡村呢，南京的先生們聽的八條，不是抽象的條件，又有具體的內容，目前這一個短的時間內，是大家想一想要緊，為此躭擱一段時間，人民總會原諒的·老實說，人民的意見，是要好好地準備，這一次談判，談是一定要談的，誰要中途停了不肯談，那是絕不許可的，因此，你們的代表一定得準備來，但是我們還得一段時間，作準備工作，不容許戰爭罪犯的規定談判的時間。因為現在我們正和北平人民作一件重要工作，和平的解決北平問題，你們在北平的人們，如傳作義將軍等，也參加了這件工作，不過據你們的通訊社的公報，你們已承認的這件工作是做的對的，這工作不但替和平談判指定了地點，而且並為南京，上海，武漢，西安，太原，歸綏，蘭州，成都，昆明，長沙，南昌，抗州，福州，廣州，台灣，海南島的和平問題，樹立了榜樣，因此這件工作是應當受到讚美的，南京的先生們，對此不應該表示不够鄭重的態度。我們正在和各民主黨派，人民團體，及無黨無派民主人士，包括在我們區域的和在你們區域的都在內，商量戰爭罪犯的名單問題，準備第一個條件的具體內容，這個名單，大約不必很久就可公佈出來。親愛的南京先生們，你們知道的事，現在我們各民主黨派人民團體，都還沒有來的及商量和正式公佈這樣一個名單，這是要請先生們原諒的，其原因，在你們的和談要求來的稍微遲了些，如果早一點，也許我們已準備好了。但是你們並不是沒有事作，除了逮捕日戰犯岡村寗次以外，你們必須繼續動手逮捕一批內戰罪犯，首先逮捕去年十二月廿五日中共某權威人士離明中所提四十三個戰犯，你們務必迅速逮捕，勿使逃匿，你們要負完全責任，稍有逃匿，卽以縱匪論，絕不姑寬，我們認為只有逮捕這些戰爭罪犯，才是為了縮短戰爭時間，减輕人民痛苦，戰爭罪犯們存在一天，只會延長戰爭時間，增加人民痛苦的』。末稱：「有關其他幾條工作，另次再通知南京」。</p>

<p>〔塔斯社莫斯科三十日電〕史達林解答一月廿七日接到的美國國際新聞社歐洲總經理史密斯先生所提四項問題如次：（問）蘇聯政府願意準備考慮和美政府發佈聯合聲明，保證兩國政府無意互相訴諸戰爭嗎？（答）蘇聯政府準備考慮發佈此項聲明。（問）蘇聯政府準備和美國政府共同採取為了履行這種和平公約而擬定的措施，如逐漸裁减軍備之類嗎？（答）蘇聯政府在採取為了履行這種和平公約而擬定的率先逐漸裁軍的措施方面，常然可以和美國政府合作。（問）如果美英法政府同意在外長會議開會審議整個德國問題以前，把建立單獨的西德國一事延擱下去，蘇聯政府就準備撤除蘇當局對柏林和德西部各佔區交通的限制嗎？（答）如果美英法遵守第三個問題中所陳述的條件，蘇聯政府認為解除運轍限制不致有陣礙，不過應根據一種默契，卽三國所實施的運輸和貿易限制，也應同時予以解除。（問）閣下準備和杜魯門總統在互相合宜的地點會晤，以便討論締給這一種和平公約的可能性嗎？（答）我以前已經聲明過，對於會晤並無異議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦卅一日電〕大部份非共產之歐州人對史達林之聲明表示懷疑，但瑞典已迅速建議任何史達林杜魯門會議在瑞典京城舉行。據接近瑞外部方面稱，瑞典願意部署史杜會議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅日電〕史達林之聲明，係緊隨蘇聯兩項重要外交行動之後，卽蘇聯政府發表白皮書，指斥北大西洋條約及蘇聯駐挪大使詢問挪威政府是否參加該約。若千人士認為史氏之言論，與法義共黨領袖之言論一致，似為一種和平攻勢，非有事實表現，不足取信。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕參院外委會主席康納利稱，史達林關於美蘇關係的聲明，在國際關係中係一意義重大之事件。渠稱，史達林之聲明願與杜魯門聯合保證避免戰爭，可能指出國際和平及和諧的新趨向。「如此係其目的，則將為一切關切和平及安全以及堅決反對侵略的人士所歡迎」。衆院外委會主席勃魯姆稱，此項聲明不能完全忽視，因此舉將使蘇聯獲得宣傳上的勝利，渠稱：「我不贊成在任何方式下綏靖蘇聯」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦卅日電〕英外交界人士今日對於史達林不反對與杜魯門會晤之談話，表示驚疑。外部發言人認為此種談話之含蓄性，値得研究。其他人士認為史氏欲使杜魯門政府更加直接與莫斯科接觸，而置英法於不顧，否則或者在移轉對於北大西洋明約之視綫。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播莫斯科訊：蘇聯本日發表白皮書，對全世界宣佈北大西洋公約乃英美發動新戰爭計劃之一部份。該白皮書譴責英美企圖控制遠東，對於簽訂對日及對德和約毫無成就，並指出北大西洋公約陰謀推翻聯合國，俾達成英美武力控制世界之目的。</p>
<p>白皮書謂，英·法·荷·比·盧西歐聯盟實為此項英美計劃之一環。又謂，英美企圖使蘇聯陷於孤立，破壞聯合國機構，對蘇聯及其衛星國實行經濟抵制，並企圖發動一新的戰爭。</p>

<p>〔聯合社挪京三十日電〕北歐三國挪威瑞典與丹麥舉行聯防談判今日已結束，發表公報，宣布雖經誠意努力，仍未覓致條約基礎。談判之失敗，乃在蘇聯向挪威行施壓迫之後。三國本來同床異夢，挪威主張參加西方，瑞典主張中立，丹麥態度尙未決定，談判遷延數月·蘇聯大使亞方西夫昨日質問挪威是否有意參加北大西洋聯盟及是否將以軍事基地讓給西方國家意在使挪威在東西兩途中扶擇其一，此舉促成三國談判之失敗據聞蘇聯並未向瑞丹提出同樣交涉。挪威方面之答覆印將提出。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司C-47型XT一三五號滬靑班機，前日（一月三十日）自滬飛靑途中，突然失踪，其後竟在共方佔領下之濟南發現。該機係於上午八時五十分自滬起飛，至中午十一時失去聯絡。公司當局發覺後，乃派XT四二號，三四號，一一四號等三機出發分頭尋覓，直至下午四時始在濟南機場上空發見該機停置於機塲中。自空中下望，機號標誌等淸晰可見，情况似頗完好，四週未見有人。</p>
<p>該機由外籍機師赫雪克（Hassig）駕駛，副機師舒之偷，電訊員汪靑園，戴乘客十七人，其中外籍兩人。乘客名單據該公司發言人稱：因昨日公司休假，各部份無人辦公，故不克發表，惟據渠所知，其中並無重要人物，大多數係赴靑島經商。</p>
<p>公司當局現靜待事態發展，希望濟南方面能有消息到來，俾可接洽一切。至於該機所以降落於濟南之原因，公司發言人拒絕作任何推測。濟南距靑島二百餘里，通常滬靑航綫可沿海直飛，但亦可經過濟南。一般猜測該機可能係途中遇共方飛機或機中雜有共方人員，致被迫降落，至如機件發生故障，航空界人士認為該機與其至濟南降落，母如維持至靑島或折返飛回上海云。</p>
<p>〔本報青島卅日電〕中國航空公司C47XT135客機一架，載客十七人，其中有青島海軍造船所長陳鄰文等，卅日晨七時五十分，由滬飛靑，中途失踪，靑中航當局當卽派機四架分途出發偵察，下午二時五十分在濟南機塲發現該機安全停放機塲東北跑道西部，在五百呎低空盤旋四次，偵悉該機停放位置端正，並無損傷模樣，共軍士兵正以黑色蓆子加以掩蓋，其雙翼及機尾右部業已蓋沒，機塲共軍人數頗多。據中航人員稱，今日華東氣候極佳，該機決不致强迫降落，可信另有內幕。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海市職工生活費指數編製審議委員會，於昨晨十時，在市府會議室舉行，由統計長褚一飛主席。出席總工會·市商會·社會局·及工業會等代表多人。首由主席致詞略稱：本市編製機構甚多，但所用方式與採取價格略有出入，近已取得聯繫。今後編製指數，將以一月份上半月指數為固定基期，因「八一九」物價，僅能作為基價，故今日發表之指數有二：（一）仍以「八一九」物價為基價（卽舊指數），計八八。四七倍。（二）以一月份上半月為基期之指數（卽新指數）計一·八四倍，至二月份起舊指數將不再計算，今後發表之指數有二：甲·以正月份上半月為基期之固定基期指數。乙·環比指數（卽前後兩期之比較）。</p>
<p>職工發薪　三種方式</p>
<p>關於職工發薪辦法，得用下列三種方式計算，其給果對於實際所得薪給，毫無影響。（一）以「八一九」底薪為底薪者，仍乘舊指數發薪，或以新指數乘四八·〇四倍，作為發薪借數。（二）以底薪改變為「八一九」底薪乘四八·〇四倍，作為三十八年正月份上半月之底薪，然後乘新訂固定基期指數發薪（即以三十八年正月上半月為基期者）。（三）自二月份起，得採用環比指數，卽將上期實發薪給，乘以環比指數。</p>
<p>又褚氏鑒於最近物價之波動，職工購買力深受影響，擬建議社會局另發工資物價審議會，俾物價與工資，更能配合適應，並為今後指數更趨合理起見，　自下期起，將指教發表前一天之物價，亦併人計算。每月發表日期，仍定於十五日及月底兩次。褚氏報吿畢，經各委員縝密審議討論，一致通過，簽字於指數單上，十一時三十分散會。</p>
<p>茲將一月份下半月職工生活費總指數及分類指數，計新指數與舊指數兩種，分別誶誌於後：</p>
<p>（甲）以三十七年「八一九」之物價為基價，總指數及分類指數之數値：（試名「舊指數」）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕農曆除夕前夜，卽一月廿七日夜十一時四十五分，本市中聯公司行駛上海基隆間之太平輪，在離滬四十餘浬舟山羣島附近洋面，突與由基隆載貨來滬之益群公司建元輪發生互撞，結果兩船同吿沉沒。建元輸上七十四名船員祗有兩人獲救，太平輪上船員乘客計千餘人，亦祗救起卅六人，實為今年繼江亞輪後又一大慘劇。</p>
<p>據太平輪獲救生還乘客追述：太平輪原定廿七日晨啓椗離滬，因臨時有鋼條一批計六百噸須裝載附運，費時甚久，嗣在裝入一百五十噸後，發現截重已逾船身規定之水平綫，當時各船員曾要求勿再繼續裝入，但該輸業務主任以此項鋼條運費已全部收訖，故卒堅持裝運四百五十噸後始行啓椗，啓椗時間延至下午四時一刻。</p>
<h3 id="c62">海面無霧無風　互撞原因不明 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>該輪因仍欲於預定時間前趕抵基隆，故駛出後開行速度極高，且未依規定航綫駕駛，而改航近路。據該乘客談：太平輪在夜十一時三刻駛抵舟山羣島附近時，海面無霧無風，但究因何故竟與迎面駛來之建元輪互撞，殊覺無法想像。渠憶當時太平輪除速度過高，航綫不符外，桅桿上之信號燈亦未燃點。至建元輪輛之航綫似亦未合規定，故兩船互撞時之位置係成直角，太平之船首猛觸建元船尾左弦五分之二部分，而兩船於事前均朱拉氣笛。建元被撞後曾燈火通明，船員紛紛躍水向太平求救，船則於十五分鐘內全部下沉。太平因急解救生艇不下，卽以　板救起兩人，迨發覺本身艙內亦已進水，乃又以全速向附近一小島回駛，但此時船身巳漸向右側。偏斜並下沉，至傾斜達四十度左右時，船內馬達聲卽吿停止。在太平船身尙未進水前，全部乘客已聞聲驚醒，紛紛搶登頂層，吶喊呼救，迨船首逐漸下沉，海面一華里外突發現有一巨型輪船駛過，可能由於喊聲所吸引，該輪曾用强烈之探照燈向太平輪之方向照射，但旋卽熄滅，並繼續開駛，並未趕來施救。根據生還乘客事後調查，該輪似係由基隆駛滬之中興輪，因當時航行方向及時間適與中興符合。在該輪駛離後，太平傾斜愈甚，未逾半小時，最後終吿翻覆，頂層乘客亦全部被壓入海中，其中有卅六人因略諳泅泳，乃得攀附本板箱籠，隨波飄流，直至廿八日晨六時半始有澳軍艦一艘因曾於事前接獲呼救電，駛來一一撈救。其餘乘客殆已全部葬身海底。</p>
<h3 id="c63">兩輪獲救者名單 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>建元輪上載貨數目，據悉僅煤炭兩千噸，此外船員七十四人。太平輪登記旅客五〇八名，船員一二四名，連無票搭乘之「黃魚」在內，約計千餘名左右。載至昨晚止，經查明太平輪獲救者有船員三人，為張成來·張海鵬·陸阿餘，及乘客卅三人，除一人之姓名不詳，其名單為吳惠康·李榮慶·高毛男·朱大華。薩炳·秦瘦喜·蔡梅華·葉立明·陳金星·徐興道·買子明·湯六子·郭捷克·廖男男·李治文·林世寶·吳子超·郭超生·雷文生·羅文林·羅文炳·曹昌秋·榮小寳·周元祥·胡尙富·孫方在（以上男性），周起秀·王曹蘭·周蘭英·林阿喜（以上女性）。建元輪獲救者為三管車唐阿殊及一火伕。至權難之乘客中，頗多滬台兩地知名之士，或其家屬，惟目前已確實判定者，僅有本市東南日報經理劉子潤之妻女二人，陸軍訓練司令部戰術敎官齊杰臣之妻女兄弟四人。</p>
<p>罹難者家屬　向當局請願</p>
<p>慘劇發生後，太平輪被難家屬卽在台滬兩地各組委員會，辦理善後，台灣方面已登記之家屬已有二四〇人，上海方面已登記者亦有五百餘人。上海方面罹難乘客家屬代表常子春·王義·龔雲彪·周國華·竺鳴鶴·鄧爾謙·吳宗濟·毛趙文娥等，赴市府謁吳市長，未有結果，今日渠等仍將由合滬兩地各推代表四人，分向市府。市參會·及治安當局請願，要求澈查肇事眞相並督促辦理善後。此外中聯公司為應各家屬要求，昨午亦撥派「海川」輪載家屬百餘人赴出事地點勘察。</p>
<p>昨招待各界　報告並呼籲</p>
<p>各被難家屬為使各界明瞭眞相，昨午後復在中聯公司招待記者，報吿數點：（一）根據種種事實，此次互撞係由於太平輪當局玩忽職務，在良好之天氣下肇事，實為我國航海史上所未有。（二）太平與建元兩輪均已逾齡，救生設備亦不完全，建元且近在台出事後尙未修復，即吿行駛。（三）出事後「太平」會發呼救急電，但本市航政當局及中聯公司方面，始終未卽派輸營救。最後渠等表示，決向各方提出呼籲數點：（一）要求兩輪當局卽日進行搶救，搜索生者，打撈死者。（二）公司當局除應負法律上之一切責任外，並應立即救濟被難乘客家屬。（三）公司當局應迅即宣佈兩輪出事之正確地點。（四）航政當局應加强防止失事之措施，並嚴格整飭航業道德。（五）希當局澈查失事眞相，早日公佈。</p>
<p>〔本報台北卅一日電〕太平輪出事後，旅客家屬泰半在台，頃巳組織善後委會，并派代表十人赴滬調查眞相，家屬方面認為此次出事，乃駕駛不愼，公司應負責任，因向警局請願，要求將中聯台分公司財產予以假扣押，經理交保，幷提出賠償之條件。</p>

<h3 id="c77">蛻變中的甘川邊境　藏區卓尼　楊復興司令　招待會側記 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州廿六日航訊〕也許是由於主人和客人年齡的相仿，也許是由於主人是屬於另一個不同的民族，記者對於楊復與司令的招待，感覺着新鮮而有意義，大家隨便的談着那個有着十多萬半農半牧的藏民族區域的一切，好像是談論異域的珍聞似的，婚姻，貨幣，面積，人口，生活，習俗，宗敎，政治，以至於世代相沿的跪拜體，都成了大家詢問的目標。在這種一個接一個的詢問中，大家滿足了好奇心，好像去遊歷了一番似的。最可寳責的還是楊生華先生的那一段有系統的介紹。</p>
<p>楊復興司令　爲什麽姓楊</p>
<p>他首先解釋「車尼」命名的由來，原來卓尼區域森林茂密，更富有馬尾松，馬尾松的藏語是「卓尼」，藏族這樣以「卓尼」作特徵，稱呼這片地方，鄰近的漢人因襲了這一名稱，形成現在盡人皆知的的這個地名。這裏的藏族是由西藏遷入的，第一代祖先名叫謝爾德，他以後成為當地的酋長，世代相襲，到明永樂年間，皇帝召見時，才賜姓楊，這就是楊司令姓楊的來源。</p>
<p>世襲的土司　已歷二十代</p>
<p>到了情朝，楊司令的祖先被封為世襲僉事，在歷次變亂中，始終站在保護人民和維持地方安寗的立塲。到民國二十五年，楊司令的父親被鄰區漢人勾結當地莠民害死，當時中央曾派田崑山先生前往處理，由於當地人民堅決反對外地人統治，一致擁護楊復興司令繼承他父親的職位，中央接納民意，遂委派年輕的楊復興為保安司令。這一世襲土司系統已經歷二十代，楊司令現在常常勉勵自己，尋求怎樣才能保持他們的光榮和業績，一刻也不敢偷懶。隔幾個月，他們便要到蘭州來住一下，以便時時瞭解外邊的情勢和學習一切新的智識，他們在努力設法適應新的時代，在敎育和生活方面，設法改善，雖然目前的情勢已經談不到求取新的幸福，而祗能消極的求取减輕人民的痛苦和負担而已。</p>
<p>卓尼區政教　兩方面運用</p>
<p>最後，他說到卓尼區政敎的關係和不同於夏河藏區的地方，當地的習慣法是這樣的：土司假若有一個兒子，那麼他便同時執掌政敎兩方面的大權，假若有兩個兒子，大兒子就掌政權，二兒子就掌敎權，以下再有兒子就是百戶千戶，至於卓尼和夏河不同的地方就是卓尼是政權大於敎權，而夏河正相反，是敎權至上，政權是在敎權以下的。</p>
<p>共四十八旗　小學十餘所</p>
<p>卓尼區現在有四十八旗，每旗自二三百戶至五六百戶不等，目前一共有十多所小學校，時代總算進步了，那些學校的學生已不再需要像當差一樣的强迫了，但是人民的生活習慣和意識，却還和從前一樣，晋見楊司令的時候，還是跪到地下，假若拒絕這種跪拜，就會被認為是瞧不起他的。</p>
<p>時代大轉變　產生新認識</p>
<p>不管怎樣，剛從南京受訓回來的楊司令，是曉得時代一天天不同，也一天天在進步了。當記者問他的弟弟丹珠呼圖克岡敎主是不是也可以結婚的時候，他笑着說：「現在不行，也許十年以後會行的。」就從這一句話，人們已可以看出這一位年輕的司令，巳經不會甚至也不願守住過去的一切了。在這時代的大轉變中，一個土司的後商能有這種認議，該是多麽難能可貴的事啊！（漢國萃）</p>

<p>— 本報記者　梁雨山</p>
<p>〔太報桂林廿五日訊〕元旦總統文吿發表後，全國同胞欣喜欲狂，大家心裏都有一個共同的願望與信念。靜寂很久的山城頓時活躍起來，東邊呼籲和平，西邊也響應和平，今天舉行和平會議，明天也是和平會議，使這南方的角落好像變了政治重心。留桂的立監委·國代·國民黨·靑年黨·民社黨各黨人士與省市參會等民意機關團體，都一致促進和平。</p>
<p>的確，這幾天的物價很令人滿意，總統引退消息傳出後，僅僅兩天工夫，五百元一担的米慘跌到三百元，黃金由一二關而一一·一〇，節節退守，袁洋自百七十高峯突降至百四十元。商店裏緊着拋左貸，他們相信和平一定會實現，物價也一定下跌。一週來的物價，只有理髮一項例外，廢曆年關將至，「有錢無錢，剪髮過年」，照例是敲一注的。</p>
<p>日來嬌陽炎厲，和風輕拂，氣溫由零度升至五十度以上。行人輕裝，祗穿一領襯衫，好像孟春氣候。商號在忙着粉飾門面，大家合奏一支迎春曲。</p>
<p>總統引退以後，和平空氣益見濃厚，留桂立委林虎等發表意見，盛讃總統引退，實為高瞻遠矚，英明果斷。李副總統出任艱鉅，維持局而，衆望所歸，信必有成。立監委國代一致饗應南京立委·國代·組織和平促進會，同時與本市各機關人民團體交換意見，均認為總統引退對和戰影響甚大，局勢從此有轉機，雙方距離漸接近。時勢所趨，萬民一致要求，和平是要實現的，遲早是時問問題而巳。因此，他們一致電總統副總統與中共毛澤東孫童兩院長，請雙方立卽放下武器，雙方派代表與各在野黨人士，各省市參議會代表，在北平言和，協商一切，以維護國家權利，保障人民自由，實現經濟平等。總之，一切措施，以人民力量為轉移。</p>
<p>由老百姓注意國事，便知道民心的向背，幾天來街上，報館門口都有成軍的讀者在看璧報，圖書館與及凡有報紙的地方，都滲入了企待和平新聞的人，一個個在祈禱和平與自由之神的來臨。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　鄭時渚</p>
<p>〔本報福州廿五日航訊〕福州自卅入年元且後，像一個暴發戶似的，慌忙得手足無措。此次中央機關加緊疏散，以台灣廣州之容量均已飽和，不得不退求東南較為適中的城市，福州在歷史上始終屈居第三四流的地位，有人謂：以上海之文明較之紐約，應差半個世紀，又以福州與上海比，亦落後五十年，此說雖不能十分精確，大體諒已相去不遠。但自台灣收復後，與福建唇齒相依，而台灣之地位日見重要，更使鄰接的大陸產生新的價値。今後和戰重心決非西南，福州塊處京。滬·合北·廣州之間，自應是一個新的據點。共黨曾廣播五月攻取福州，是則英雄所見略同，共軍亦已注意這個正在成長中的小都市在最近將來的重要性。</p>
<p>疏散計劃　如箭離弦</p>
<p>為補救內陸交通的缺點，閩贛鐵路傳卽開工，公路卽將積極改善，惟此緩不濟急，短期內談何容易。政府在能戰始能言和的口號下，疏散計劃如脫弓之矢，而聯勤總部，國防部的前站人員，亦已陸續到達。正値此時，閩·贛·粵·三省主席易人，朱紹良以福州綏靖主任兼攝福建省政，以與台灣之陳誠與廣東之薛岳相配合。</p>
<p>混合家庭　零亂促侷</p>
<p>迄目前為止，福州可封用以及可租用的房屋，由城市以至近郊，殆已佔用無遺。公軍機關的眷屬，用盡一切可能的方法，搬進了但求略能容身的住屋，至今尙有不少的眷屬在疏散站的地板上過着混合家庭的生活，一種零亂不安的情緒普遍地籠罩着每個流徒人們的心中·單身的人，以疏散期中無所事事，終日間散街頭，有家室之累的，則忙着家庭的分工，佈置最起碼的簡陋的堪面，這是一幅尷尬的畫面。</p>
<p>繁榮機會　表示歡迎</p>
<p>在這嚴重的房荒聲中，却另有一個可愛的插曲，在福州城東約七十公里的一個海濱市鎭，竟公開歡迎疏散機關或規模較大學校的移防，他們以風景優美交通便利為辭，可見亦有人珍惜此千載一時的繁榮機會。</p>
<p>和談呼聲　有所期望</p>
<p>福州的人民樸素而古舊，穿着筆挺西裝的男人是不多見的，今日的情形似乎略有改變，連穿西裝褲子的女人都要比過去穿西裝的男人多，雖然她們的數量還遠不及街頭草綠色制服的軍人那慶多，可是她們由京滬帶來衣飾的鮮明顏色，則有過之而無不及。</p>
<p>和談的呼聲很響，人心在期待着新的局面，有人在呼籲福州義序機塲停工，希望機關暫時停止疏散，畸形的繁榮與紛亂的遷徒，只會造成不良的後果。</p>

<p>— 本報記者石武威</p>
<p>〔本報無錫廿六日訊〕人冬以來，錫地雖實施戒嚴，然仍盜刦類聞，且竟連續發生血案，影響社會治安非鮮。昨晨四時戒嚴期中，又有兇殺案兩起，一在南郊，是更夫郭雨林被竊賊殺死一是情殺案，係一靑年軍官，利用身穿戒裝戒嚴時可以通行無阻的關係，得以從容動手，從容逸去。這位軍官名張際明，因為熟戀京劇坤伶張玉燕，以至發生佔有慾，無奈愛情不是單方面所可强迫，該軍官在一再恫嚇並無反應以後，失望之餘，頓萌殺人之動機，用手槍射死了戀人和情敵。</p>
<p>坤伶艷麗　軍官追求</p>
<p>死者張王燕，現年十九歲，是武生張玉亭張少燕夫婦之義女。九歲開始學戱，十一歲卽與玉亭藝徒趙罄聲（兄卽趙松樵）訂婚，惟並不常在一起。勝利後，張氏父女參加五十八軍主辦之「春秋劇團」，在南宿州出演，當時玉燕以色藝俱臻上乘，頗得觀衆歡迎。會有駐宿交警總局政工大隊長，張際明，見張扮相艷麗，驚為天人，卽存染指之念，想盡種種方法，初與玉亭互通款曲，旋踵門獻送紅綉軟區，最後竟不惜金錢，組織「萬國劇團」，委張玉亭為團長，張為名利所誘，乃辭去春秋劇團職務，率領玉燕等，轉返南京在介壽堂勝利廳中央舞台演唱。</p>
<p>噓寒問暖　愛苗滋長</p>
<p>未幾，際明亦辭去宿遷政工隊職務赴京，專心致力為萬國劇團謀發展。演唱月餘，玉燕忽患肺疾，際明認為時機已至，乃慫恿輟演，先勸玉亭將班底帶回無錫，繼送玉燕入院醫治，際明朝夕噓寒問暖，體貼入微，從此發生愛苗。病愈出院後，卽偕往蕪湖作蜜月旅行，實行同居。直至去年三月問，經玉亭一再函催，張始偕玉燕來錫，一度以萬國劇團名義，在惠泉農橋中國戱院演唱，一月後又返蕪湖，玉亭及趙罄聲等仍闔家在錫，因覓屋困難，暫寫東新旅社十一號，趙獨住十二號，嗣玉燕亦於十二月底隻身來錫，與趙同居，旋入中東戱院演唱，懸首席牌。</p>
<p>不見伊人　愛情東流</p>
<p>惟際明從此不再見伊人歸來，望眼欲穿，乃三次蒞錫，促她返蕪，被玉亭托故力阻，張空勞往返，旋又三度函催，亦不之理。迨第四函至，措詞暴露憤慨。玉亭知無法隱瞞，乃復函際明，直吿小女玉燕，自幼卽許婚與趙罄聲為妻，今後請勿再以玉燕為念等語，張接函後，方悟金錢與愛情，業已盡付東流，而殺機亦因此發生。</p>
<p>戲子無義　千里尋仇</p>
<p>數日前，際明由京來錫，住泰山飯店，暗中偵知玉燕夫婦住處，卽於昨晨四時許，身懷六寸白郎林手槍，子彈登膛，在實施戒嚴令下，逕赴東新旅社，敲門入內，但見玉燕與趙，擁衾交頸而眠，不禁妬火中燒。不由分說，舉槍向彼兩放射，各中三槍。一彈中玉燕右乳部，子彈未曾穿出，當塲斃侖。趙之大腸與胃陽，亦各有四個槍傷，生命危殆。迨玉亭聞聲趕出，而際明早已從容下樓逸去。當卽報吿治安機關，一面將傷人送大華醫院救治，延至廿六晨八時亦吿身死。天明後，並具狀由當地岡正偕同投報地檢處，請求相騐。聞兇手現尙服務首都衛戌總部，城防部巴派員跟蹤逍緝。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] Acting President Li, accompanied by Qiu Changwei, Huang Xuecun, and others, flew to Shanghai by special plane on the morning of the 31st. Shao Lizi was invited to join them and returned to Nanjing in the dusky evening amidst rain and fog after completing his official duties in Shanghai. President of the Legislative Yuan, Tong Guanxian, and others came along. Shao Lizi will stay in Shanghai for a day and is scheduled to return to Nanjing by civil aviation plane on the afternoon of the 1st. There are rumors that Shao Lao may fly to Beiping first.</p>
<p>[News from this Newspaper] Acting President Li arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 10:30 AM from Beijing on the "Zhuiyun" special plane, accompanied by Shao Lizi, Qiu Changwei, Cheng Siyuan, Huang Xuecun, and others. After disembarking, Acting President Li immediately drove to the Bank of China building on the Bund for a temporary rest. At around 11:00 AM, he summoned over 20 social figures and celebrities from various circles here (mostly non-partisan), including Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Leng Yuqiu, Chen Guangfu, and Jiang Yong, to hold a discussion. Mr. Li immediately solicited everyone's opinions on peace. Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, and Vice-Premier Tiecheng, were both present. At around 12:00 noon, he had lunch with all the attendees. After the meal, Acting President Li held a discussion with Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and the heads of various ministries and commissions who remained in Shanghai. At 3:30 PM, Acting President Li left first and drove to visit Madam Sun and He Yingqin, etc. At 4:45 PM, he rushed to Longhua Airport and took off on the original plane at around 5:00 PM to return to Beijing, accompanied by Gan Jiehou, Huang Xuecun, and others. Those who went to the airport to see him off included Wu Tiecheng, Hong Lanyou, He Chengjun, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Guozhen, Chen Daqing, Yang Hu, and Yu Shuping, etc. When Acting President Li was leaving, he told reporters: "We will continue to work hard to promote peace, and the government has decided to move to Guangzhou."</p>
<p>[News from this Newspaper] Since noon yesterday, the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan held an important military meeting on the fourth floor of the Bank of China building on the Bund here. In addition to Premier Sun, Vice-Premier Wu, and the heads of various ministries and commissions, Hong Lanyou, Xu Kan, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Weichi, Zuo Shunsheng, and Duan Caihai, etc., more than ten people, Acting President Li also attended the meeting, but left early midway, and the Executive Yuan meeting did not end until 4:20 PM. After the meeting, all the heads remained tight-lipped about the content of the meeting. However, it is understood that the government has drafted a formal statement in response to the broadcast by the CCP spokesperson on the evening of January 28, which was sent to the Central News Agency in Beijing last night (31st) for release. Acting President Li also decided to invite five non-partisan social leaders here, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Leng Yuqiu, Chen Guangfu, and Jiang Yong, to fly to Beiping in a private capacity to contact representatives of the CCP, inquire whether the CCP is willing to negotiate peace, and if they are willing, to ask them to appoint representatives, designate a location and time, and conduct peace talks as soon as possible. In addition, they also exchanged detailed opinions on the promotion of peace talks and various measures after the government moved to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Shao Lizi did not participate in yesterday's meeting. Shao was discovered by reporters in the corridor and immediately surrounded. Shao only said: "You have more information than I do. I have no opinion to express now." Premier Sun left in a hurry after the meeting and was unwilling to speak. Xu Kan and Zhu Jiahua did not give a definite answer on whether to go to Beijing or Guangzhou. Liu Gongyun simply said: "I don't know." Wu Tiecheng left a step late and was surrounded by reporters. He answered reporters' questions, saying: "The government has decided to move to Guangzhou on the 5th, and I will go to Guangzhou before the 5th. Judging from the CCP's previous broadcasts, the hope for the future of peace is very small, but it has not reached the point of despair." Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Duan Mukai, shouted to the reporters as he stepped into the elevator: "The government has decided to move the capital, and we will continue to work hard for peace."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] The government's move to the south will complete its factual and legal significance due to the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting in Guangzhou on the 3rd. The relocation of foreign embassies in China is also gradually being put into action, but since Acting President Li is still stationed in Nanjing, few foreign envoys have gone south. Most have sent staff members to plan everything in advance. Some staff members of the US Embassy, led by Minister Clark, flew to Guangzhou on the 29th. US Ambassador Stuart Lei Deng continued to stay here and handle official business as usual. At 4:30 PM on the 30th, he still went to Jinling University for worship. The embassy and the ambassador's residence were as quiet as ever. A few officials from the Soviet Embassy also flew south on the 30th. Ambassador Luoshen's illness has recovered, and he is scheduled to leave Beijing for Guangzhou on the 2nd, becoming the first among the envoys to take action. However, the embassy spokesperson remained silent on the move to the south. The work in the office is still very busy, as usual. He did not deny the possibility that the ambassador may return to Moscow to report on his duties in the future. The attitude of the British and its autonomous dominion embassies towards the move to the south seems quite indifferent. Apart from the British Embassy sending Counselor Gao Helu to fly to Guangzhou on the 2nd, there is no other action. Indian Ambassador Panigai and French Ambassador Meili Ai both refused to disclose any preparations for the move to the south. Burmese Ambassador Yu Midun said that the embassy secretary, Taiwan Zao, will go to Guangzhou on the 2nd to arrange the premises. Egyptian Ambassador Ismail also said that he would send a secretary south soon. Most other foreign embassies remained silent. According to sources, it is estimated that two-thirds of the national embassies will move to Guangzhou with the government in the short term, and the remaining one-third may stay in Beijing on the orders of their home countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th Dispatch] The State Department announced yesterday that the US Ambassador to China will temporarily be stationed in both Nanjing and Guangzhou. Ambassador Stuart Lei Deng will stay in Nanjing, and the embassy's minister counselor will move to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 30th Dispatch] A British Foreign Office spokesperson announced yesterday that British Ambassador Stephen will remain in Nanjing and will not move to Guangdong with the Chinese government. A senior British diplomat will accompany the government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 30th Dispatch] Philippine Minister to China, Sebastian, was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing today to take up his post, but the government has instructed him to postpone his trip for safety reasons.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 31st Dispatch] It is learned that Sun Ke and Tong Guanxian will come to Guangzhou within days. Dozens of senior officials from the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan have arrived here. It is said that the Presidential Office will be located in Shipai, and the Executive Yuan will work in the Guangdong Reception Office. The Judicial and Supervisory Yuan will be located in Zhongshan County. The location of the Legislative Yuan is being planned. The Ministry of National Defense is in Qujiang, northern Guangdong. The vanguard has arrived here. Minister of Education Chen Xueping and Acting Minister of Justice Zhao Shen have arrived in the city, and the two ministries have begun work. It is reported that the Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold its first political affairs meeting in Guangzhou on February 3.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 31st Dispatch] Vice-President of the Legislative Yuan, Liu Jianqun, led 26 personnel and arrived in Guangzhou by plane on the 30th. The second batch of personnel is on their way to Guangzhou via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Also, Ma Chaojun, Minister of Agriculture and Labor of the Central Party Department, arrived in Guangzhou on the 31st.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 30th Dispatch] According to reliable sources, Admiral Ramsey, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, will come to Qingdao in the near future to inspect his navy. After the Marines' land service ended and they boarded the ships, there have been no changes so far.

<h3 id="e7">He Yingqin Will Take an Important Position; His Hemorrhoids Will Recover Soon and He Will Go to Beijing Within Days <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[News from this Newspaper] General He Yingqin previously suffered from hemorrhoids and came to Shanghai for treatment. After undergoing surgery a few days ago, he recovered very well. He has now moved from the National Defense Hospital back to his private residence on Linsen Road for recuperation and is expected to recover to normal within days. It is learned that the government is urging Mr. He to take up an important position. A certain central figure came to Shanghai a few days ago and visited Mr. He at his private residence to convey the government's opinions. In addition, on New Year's Day of the lunar calendar, General Bai Chongxi from Hankou made two long-distance phone calls to discuss the current situation with Mr. He. General Tang Enbo, Commander of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison, also visited him after arriving in Shanghai. Yesterday, after Acting President Li visited Shanghai, he also had a long discussion with Mr. He. According to reliable sources, Mr. He may take up an important position after his health is restored. Mr. He was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for Taiwan by ship on February 1 to recuperate, but after being persuaded, he has cancelled his trip to Taiwan. As soon as the hemorrhoids heal, he may go to Beijing within days. Note: When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, and Sun Chuanfang secretly crossed the Yangtze River to attack Longtan, General He Yingqin presided over military affairs and reversed the critical situation in one battle, creating brilliant achievements. Currently, the Communist army is declaring an attack on the south bank of the Yangtze River. It is expected that General Tang's visit this time is related to the Yangtze River defense issue. According to a certain military observer, it is not easy for the Communist army to cross the river based on their strength, and the national army has gathered considerable strength along the river. The Ministry of National Defense has made it clear that it will resist if the Communist army crosses the river and invades. The Beijing-Shanghai line is the essence of the country, and Shanghai is the largest base of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. It can also be regarded as the Stalingrad of the German-Soviet War.</p>

<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 31st Dispatch] The newly appointed Chairman of Guangdong, Xue Yue, told reporters today that the four provinces of South China are preparing to be the last line of defense against communism. Regardless of the outcome of the peace talks in North China, I intend to lead the people of the four provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Fujian to defend themselves and resist communism, not hesitating to sacrifice themselves. The alliance of the four provinces is being planned. When asked by reporters whether the independent operations of the provinces in South China were a split from the Nanjing government, Mr. Xue replied: "We are fighting against both the feudal system and communism. As the chairman of the province, I intend to engage in the political and economic reforms that have been neglected in the past. If the current peace efforts fail, Mr. Jiang will make a comeback." Mr. Xue emphasized the independent position of the four provinces in South China. Mr. Xue finally said that China's anti-communist struggle and the United States' anti-communist struggle in the Pacific are now concentrated in the provinces of South China. Although the number of national defense forces in Guangdong Province is no match for the 60,000 armed separatist elements in Guangdong Province, this struggle is a joint effort of the four provinces and is not isolated.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 31st Dispatch] The Communist army entered the city through Xizhimen at 1:00 PM on the 31st, welcomed by students, workers, and the people.</p>
<p>[News from this Newspaper] The CCP radio station in northern Shaanxi broadcasted on the 31st that the Communist army had entered Beiping on the 31st, and called the "liberation" of Beiping "a good example of ending the war by peaceful means by implementing Mao Zedong's eight conditions." The radio station also called on the generals of Qingdao, Taiyuan, Gui Sui, and other cities in North China and other government-controlled areas to "learn from General Fu Zuoyi's example and implement true peace." Regarding Fu himself, the radio station claimed: "Fu Zuoyi once carried out the so-called suppression of the rebellion order, and therefore became one of the war criminals, but since he accepted the peace conditions and drove the troops out of the city to await reorganization, as long as he continues to do work that is beneficial to the people in the future, he may still be forgiven by the people and allowed to show remorse by good deeds."</p>

On the 29th, Zhang rarely discussed the current situation with visitors, except for contacting a few military and political leaders, only saying: "It would be good if we can make peace. If the opinions on peace negotiations are close, we can come out again at any time." Zhang left Hankou and flew to Lanzhou at 10:00 AM on the 30th. Commander-in-Chief Bai and Xu Zuyi, Li Pinxian, Zhang Dulun, Zhang Zhen, and Xu Huizhi, etc., all went to the airport to see him off. According to Zhang's remarks to reporters at the airport, there are no new developments in the peace talks that can be reported. As for the rumors that he will represent the government in signing a commercial agreement with the Soviet Union, Zhang replied that this is a local external commercial agreement in Xinjiang, and its nature is very ordinary.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 31st Dispatch] The dull atmosphere in Wuhan turned bright on the 31st. Commander-in-Chief Bai held a Spring Festival tea party at 3:00 PM to report on the trend of the situation to the local elders and public representatives. Mr. Bai first stated the process of seeking peace, saying: People in various places, in view of the tragic pain of the eight-year war of resistance and the three-year civil war, have universally issued peace calls. In order to comply with public opinion, the government has not hesitated to compromise and seek perfection, making the greatest concessions to show its sincerity in seeking peace, such as President Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's message, his resignation, Acting President Li's announcement of seven measures, and the appointment of peace negotiation representatives, admitting that the eight conditions are the basis for peace talks, etc., all of which have been done to the best of our ability, and the facts are all there. However, the CCP has not only shown no sincerity in peace talks, but also continued its military offensive on Jinpu, Longhai, Pinghan, and Jingmen and Dangyang in northern Hubei, which has prevented peace from developing smoothly, creating today's stalemate. At this point, Mr. Bai declared in a calm and firm tone: Under this situation, the government will never give up peace before the hope of peace is extinguished, and must adhere to its original intention and make the greatest and best efforts in order to respect public opinion and achieve true peace. However, if the Communist army continues to advance and the war continues as a result, making peace hopeless, then the responsibility for this will be judged by the people. When talking about the Wuhan Peace Promotion Association's hope that there will be no war in Wuhan, Mr. Bai calmly said that he personally also has this wish, but peace cannot be sought from one side. In addition to urging the government, people from all walks of life must also earnestly appeal to the CCP, asking it to stop the war immediately, so that there is hope for the future of peace and the safety of Wuhan can be ensured. Mr. Bai's speech was implicit and clear, and everyone responded with warm applause. Also, after Mr. Bai finished his speech, representatives from all walks of life, who had been very silent, spoke one after another, full of indignation. Zhao Shibin, director of the rickshaw drivers' union, advocated that the people should propose a list of communist war criminals and let the people judge them. Cheng Ziju, director of the Chamber of Commerce, hoped that the government would continue to work hard for peace, and if there were obstacles, he would be willing to support the government in implementing a comprehensive "peace war." Professor Wang Menglin of Zhongda University said, "If we are wronged and cannot achieve perfection, we can only comfort the people and punish the criminals." Zhang Yaoxian, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, stated that peace cannot be partial, but must reform politics and economics to seek a thorough and comprehensive peace.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Government Response to CCP Statement, Hoping to Promote Early Opening of Peace Talks with Utmost Sincerity <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The government spokesperson on the 31st issued a response statement to the CCP's statement on the 28th (content published on page 2); according to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from northern Shaanxi on the 28th, the CCP spokesperson issued a statement regarding the peace proposals put forward by the government. The main points of the opinions they raised in that statement can be summarized as follows: (1) They cannot agree with the acquittal of Japanese war criminal Neiji Okamura. (2) The government should first arrest the so-called "war criminals" they have proposed to sufficiently demonstrate the government's sincerity for peace. (3) The government's attitude toward the local peace efforts in Beiping is not serious enough. Our first impression of this statement is that the attitude seems not "serious" enough, but we are still willing to calmly answer it: Regarding the Okamura Neiji case, it is a judicial issue that is completely unrelated to peace talks, and it cannot be used as a prerequisite for peace talks. The government handles many affairs every day. If the CCP side introduces such extraneous issues, raising one issue today and another tomorrow, we will not only be unable to cope with it, but the two parties will become unable to approach each other. Secondly, regarding the point that "war criminals" should be arrested first, we believe that today both sides are preparing to conduct peace talks, and the government has already acknowledged its willingness to hold negotiations based on the eight conditions proposed by the CCP, then all the conditions that have been put forward should of course be resolved in the meeting. It is absolutely impossible to demand execution first and then hold a meeting. If the conditions can be executed without discussion, why would peace talks be necessary? This may make the people suspect whether the Communist side is truly sincere about peace. We cannot help but feel deeply sorry for this, because true peace should not have preconditions. Previously, we advocated a ceasefire first, followed by peace talks, and the Communist side also criticized us for the same reason, saying that we were not sincere. Regarding the third point, they did not raise any specific content, so we have no way to answer it. In short, we feel that everyone – whether on the government side or the CCP side – should first have a correct basic concept, which is that the demand for peace today is the common will of the people of the whole country. We are seeking a way to resolve domestic disputes through political means in order to follow the will of the people. We must respect each other and be tolerant of each other in order to make the peace talks begin quickly and proceed smoothly. Whoever is not sincere will be criticized and opposed by the people. At the same time, we hope that the CCP side will know that the government side today is not unable to fight again, but unwilling to fight again, and cannot bear to fight again. Because today's country and people really cannot withstand the persecution and devastation of war. If we acknowledge that the purpose of the revolution is for the interests of the people and the country, and that the motive of the revolution is based on the will of the majority of the people, then at a time when the country and the people are suffering so much, and when the people of the whole country are demanding peace, we have absolutely no reason to continue engaging in war. At the same time, we should understand that in today's war situation, although the Communist army has won several battles and occupied several cities in the past few months, a temporary military advantage is not enough to determine the final victory or defeat, and war can never solve problems. This is a lesson of history. Only political means can solve everything, and only mutual tolerance for the sake of the country and open and honest dialogue can permanently eliminate the scourge of war and permanently establish peace. As for what the spokesperson said, "You have angered the people, the people have unanimously risen up to oppose you and fight you to the death, the people do not like you, and you have turned around to seek peace," there is no need to respond to this point. However, as far as we know, the people in the CCP areas are still living a very painful life, and the people and students in the CCP-occupied areas are fleeing to the government areas one after another. This is an iron fact. Regarding this point, we will only mention it in passing here and do not want to provoke a debate because of it. Fortunately, the facts can speak for themselves, and the people's hearts have a fair judgment. In short, we are working to achieve peace for the sake of the country and the people. The people are longing for the arrival of peace. We sincerely hope that the CCP side will also use the utmost sincerity to promote the early convening of peace talks and to stop the war as soon as possible. This is not only the wish of the government side, but also the wish of the people of the whole country.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Talking About Peace in the New Year <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The New Year holiday has passed in a flash. The sunshine is shining, the gentle breeze is pleasant, and people have a feeling that winter is over and spring has returned. When relatives and friends meet, they follow the old customs, and sounds of congratulations fill the air. But upon reflection, where does the joy come from? Everyone's mind is filled with words of self-consolation and consolation, based on the hope for peace.</p>
<p>The term "peace" represents harmony and symbolizes a peaceful scene, which is what everyone desires. If weapons can be turned into gifts and the atmosphere of hostility can be turned into auspiciousness, who would not welcome it? However, President Chiang's New Year's Day message was issued a month ago, and Acting President Li has been in charge of the central government for more than ten days. Their pursuit of peace is not only reflected in humble words, but also in sincere and unremitting actions. President Chiang has resolutely retired, and Acting President Li came to Shanghai yesterday to solicit the opinions of social leaders, asking Mr. Yan Huiqing and others to go to Beiping to inquire about the CCP's true intentions, in an attempt to prevent the door to peace from being blocked again. This shows that the government officials can truly understand the depth of the people's suffering and are doing their best to seek peace. However, what is the CCP's response? Is peace still a distant and unattainable prospect?</p>
<p>CCP Chairman Mao Zedong broadcast his eight-point basis for peace talks. The content of which has been discussed in this newspaper before. Acting President Li even telegraphed Mr. Mao expressing his willingness to start negotiations based on these eight points. Logically speaking, as long as the CCP designates representatives and specifies a location, peace talks can proceed, and the flames of war can cease. Unexpectedly, one wave subsides, and another rises. The CCP's demands are clearly increasing inch by inch. The list of "war criminals" has been increasing batch after batch, perhaps without end, and their so-called "order" to the Nanjing National Government to first arrest "war criminals" and send them to the CCP for trial is becoming more and more demanding day by day. Under this circumstance, even if Acting President Li is a person with extreme "patience and self-cultivation," it would be difficult for him to go in person and offer himself for punishment. Indeed, a person who can truly understand the suffering of the people, if he can determine that his own punishment can save the people from being poisoned again, may be able to embrace the sacrificial spirit of Buddha feeding the tiger and throw himself into the tiger's den. But at least he needs to know that after he throws himself into the tiger's mouth, the people will be spared the tiger's scourge after all. But what about now? If batches of so-called "war criminals" are sent forward, naked and leading a goat, before the CCP stops advancing, before peace is achieved, and before the people's right to a free life is guaranteed, and in the future the people will still be slaughtered, persecuted, and suffer the pain of wives and children being separated and crying in hunger, then can this kind of humiliating surrender-style peace really benefit the people?</p>
<p>Moreover, peace, peace, these two words are inseparable. Without harmony, there can be no peace, and without peace, there can be no harmony. Harmony and peace, peace and harmony, complement each other and are mutually causal. We the people, certainly do not favor any party, but in our hearts we have a perfectly fair and just view. The government officials in the past were indeed mostly unworthy, but the CCP may not be able to make all the people sincerely convinced, otherwise, where do tens of thousands of refugees come from? Let's not talk about the past. Today, the government and the CCP both claim to be saving the country and the people, and "liberating" the people. The most important and urgent thing for the people at present is to immediately stop fighting and immediately cease fire. Only a ceasefire is a symbol of "harmony" and the beginning of "harmony." The government has now declared its willingness to cease fire immediately. We the people only need to ask the CCP: Do you want to cease fire immediately or not? If the war is stopped, everything can be discussed, both sides can talk openly and honestly, and both sides can talk frankly. If, on the one hand, they are willing to talk about peace, and on the other hand, they are still advancing, this is simply ridiculous! The war has now reached the Yangtze River. This is the best opportunity for both sides to truly act for the people and stop fighting and make peace. The government is withdrawing its troops step by step in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, and at least it can be said that it has absolutely no intention of launching a counterattack on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Therefore, as long as the CCP does not take advantage of this to advance and no longer provoke war with artillery fire, then once the war stops, the door to peace can be opened. However, what will be the CCP's response in the next few days? Can they be moved by the suffering of the people because of the northward flight of Mr. Yan Huiqing and other elderly gentlemen?</p>
<p>Secondly, peace and war are a whole, two sides of the same coin. If the overall situation does not have comprehensive peace, then local peace is also futile. This is a very simple principle. Because the current war has no so-called front or rear, there is a painful war life as long as there is war for one day. Even if Beiping signs local peace terms, if there is no comprehensive peace in the future and they continue to wage war against each other, can the people of Beiping transcend the war and live a leisurely life? The "joining the army" (i.e., conscription in the Communist areas) in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, the "liquidation" in Jinan and Tianjin... the people of Beiping will not be immune to the taste of wartime life experienced by the people in these Communist areas. The Beijing-Shanghai area has not yet reached the day of encirclement, but some people are already blindly advocating local peace. This is not a sincere attempt to seek peace, but to take advantage of the people's desire for temporary security and pave the way for the CCP to "accept surrender." This is called hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat's false peace! In fact, if the people are really willing to surrender to the CCP and sacrifice their free life, that's fine. If not, then those who talk carelessly about local peace are no different from making us drink poison to quench our thirst. Although the thirst is quenched, life is not guaranteed, and we will inevitably regret it in the future. Therefore, we are definitely not pro-war, we are determined to have peace, but what we want is comprehensive peace, overall peace, permanent peace, and definitely not local peace in one place or corner, nor temporary peace for one month or half a month.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also remind those who are currently overwhelmed by the call for peace: peace cannot be obtained without paying a price. We, the people, must have strength, we must use our strength, show others that we cannot be deceived, show others that we cannot be conquered, and then we can obtain true peace. US Secretary of State Acheson said: "Anyone who attempts to attack or threaten the security of our country with force will encounter overwhelming resistance." The reason why Marshal Stalin declared his willingness to meet with President Truman to discuss the peace issue between the US and the Soviet Union today is because the United States has this kind of "strength." To generalize, the Soviet people have the strength to defend Stalingrad, and the British people have the strength to defend the British Isles, and then there is the peace enjoyed by the people of the two countries, Britain and the Soviet Union, after the Second World War. Therefore, to put it narrowly, if the citizens of Shanghai really want to enjoy true peace and permanent peace, they must first have the strength to defend Greater Shanghai. To put it broadly, if the National Government really wants to seek true peace and permanent peace for the people, it is better to seek it from its own strength, especially from strengthening the defense of the Yangtze River, than from the sincerity of seeking it from the CCP. If you have strength but cannot use it, and you have the Yangtze River but cannot defend it, what are you still talking about peace?</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] Senator McCarran (Democrat), chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation of the Senate and House of Representatives, said that the time has come for the United States to take an anti-communist stance in Asia, as it has done in Europe. The United States should use 600 to 700 million yuan for direct military assistance to China, 200 to 300 million yuan for civilian daily necessities assistance, and allocate several hundred million to allow them to purchase silver from the US Treasury Department as a stabilization fund to consolidate the Chinese monetary system. This plan will not be submitted to Congress for the time being, but may be submitted in the future. I want to first observe what the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department do with China. There are several prerequisites for US aid to China, one of which is the reorganization of the Chinese government. At the same time, the Chinese army must be thoroughly subject to US military supervision. The United States will send about 600 to 700 military officers to stay in China. Some people say that sending a US military officers group to China will cause a war between the US and the Soviet Union. I don't think so. It is well known that Soviet generals support the CCP. Captured CCP generals have admitted to following the orders of the Kremlin officials. The economic part of my plan can be incorporated into the new Economic Cooperation Act, which will be discussed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee starting on February 8, and military assistance is another issue.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Cleveland, director of the China program of the Economic Cooperation Administration, announced on the night of the 27th that supplies worth approximately 50 million yuan in US aid to China would continue to be shipped to China, pending further instructions. These supplies include so-called emergency supplies, such as rice, cotton, fertilizer, kerosene, and some coal. The distribution is as follows: (1) Rice worth approximately 21 million yuan will be supplied to the household rations in Shanghai and other large cities in South China. (2) Cotton is worth 15 million yuan. (3) Fertilizer is worth 9 million yuan and is used for spring plowing. (4) Fuel oil is worth 5 million yuan and is supplied to cities in South China. Mr. Cleveland also reiterated his previous statement that food and daily necessities worth 4 million yuan left in Tianjin and Beiping under the occupation of the Communist army will continue to be distributed, but relief supplies will no longer be shipped to the occupied areas in the future.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 30th] Griffin, Deputy Director of the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration, left yesterday to return to his post in Shanghai. Before leaving, reporters asked whether the handling of relief affairs in the Communist-occupied areas had been discussed during this return to the country to report on his work. Mr. Griffin replied: "This is a matter for the State Department and the President to decide." A reporter asked for his views on the Chinese situation. Mr. Griffin said: "We should rebuild a nationally unified policy on China." Mr. Griffin said that he would not worry about his personal safety after returning to his post. Mrs. Griffin did not accompany him to China.</p>

<p>Huabei Daily Loses Freedom of Speech, Tianjin Minguo Daily Has Been Taken Over</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] A spokesman for the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Kuomintang declared: Since the national army successively withdrew from Beiping and the Communist army entered the city, the Huabei Daily has lost freedom of speech. The president of the newspaper, Zhang Mingwei, was ordered to leave Beiping and come to Nanjing in advance, and he will no longer be responsible for any substantive position in the newspaper. The spokesperson also said: The Tianjin Minguo Daily has now been taken over by the Communist Party, and all employees have been forced to leave the newspaper. The editors and publishers of the Beiping Huabei Daily have lost their freedom. These two events are enough to make journalists realize that there is no such thing as freedom of the press under the control of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] Okamura Neiji, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, and 160 convicted war criminals will be sent back to Japan on the American ship John Weeks to be imprisoned in Sugamo Prison in Tokyo. Although Okamura was acquitted by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, the CCP's broadcast telegram expressed dissatisfaction with this judgment and demanded that he be handed over to the Communist army for retrial. A reporter asked Carpenter, head of the legal section of the Allied Headquarters, on what legal grounds the Japanese war criminals were handed over from China to the United States this time. Carpenter replied that the matter was decided by MacArthur himself, and the reason was presumably based on humanitarian and political reasons. He said that if the Japanese war criminals fell into the hands of the CCP, the CCP might mistreat them or use various bad means such as letting them off lightly for propaganda purposes.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Content of the CCP's 28th Statement <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] On January 26th, the government spokesman issued a brief statement regarding the promotion of peace, responding to the CCP spokesman's statement on the 25th. It was believed that the CCP's failure to promptly appoint representatives, agree on a location, and cease military operations was aimed at delaying time and prolonging the war. Therefore, the government reiterated its sincerity for peace, hoping that the CCP would appoint representatives as soon as possible to conduct negotiations, so that peace could be realized at an early date. According to a Xinhua News Agency broadcast on the 28th, the CCP spokesman issued a lengthy statement in response to the government spokesman's statement on the 26th. The first paragraph of the statement emphasized opposition to the Defense Ministry's war criminal trial court's verdict on Okamura Yasuji. Subsequently, reasons were given for the delay in appointing peace talk representatives and agreeing on a location, and it was emphasized that the immediate arrest of the CCP's so-called "war criminals" was a prerequisite for peace talks. The content of the Xinhua News Agency broadcast "CCP Spokesman's Statement on the Peace Demands Put Forward by the Kuomintang Reactionary Government" is excerpted as follows: First, it stated: According to a Shanghai telegram from the Nanjing Central News Agency on the 26th, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces to China, Yasuji Okamura, was declared innocent at 4 p.m. on the 26th after a retrial by the War Criminal Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. The CCP spokesman stated that this Japanese war criminal, Yasuji Okamura, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces to China, was the main war criminal among all war criminals of the Japanese invasion of China. Now he has been declared innocent by the war criminal military tribunal of the Kuomintang reactionary government. The General Headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army declare: This is unacceptable. We now warn the Nanjing reactionary government: "You should quickly arrest Yasuji Okamura without delay, because this is closely related to the matter of our joint negotiations that you are now requesting. We have the right to order you to re-arrest Yasuji Okamura and, in accordance with the time and location that we will notify you of, you will be responsible for escorting him to the People's Liberation Army. Other Japanese war criminals will be temporarily held by you. Hereafter, you must not release them or allow them to escape without authorization; those who violate this will be severely punished without leniency." Then it said:</p>
<p>"From the statement of the Nanjing reactionary government spokesman on January 26th, it seems that the gentlemen in Nanjing are so nervous, enthusiastic, diligent, and eager for peace talks, while the CCP seems so unconcerned, unenthusiastic, undiligent, and uneager about accepting your wishes. If you do not stop the war, you are delaying time and 'prolonging the war'. We honestly tell you, gentlemen in Nanjing, that you are war criminals, you are people who are to be tried. We do not believe in your so-called 'peace' and 'ceasefire'. Relying on the power of the United States, violating the will of the people, tearing up the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, you launched this extremely cruel anti-people, anti-democratic, anti-revolutionary civil war. At that time, you were so nervous, enthusiastic, and eager, ignoring the advice of millions of people. Now, after two and a half years, you have committed heinous crimes, and this debt must be settled. Although some of you are against liquidation and struggle, this liquidation and struggle is justified and must be liquidated, calculated, struggled, and debated. Therefore, you turn around and seek peace. You have put forward five points, and we have put forward eight points. The people immediately support our eight points and do not support your five points. You dare not criticize our eight points and dare not insist on your five points. You are willing to use our eight points as the basis for negotiation. Is this not good enough? Why are you not negotiating quickly? So, it seems that you are very nervous, very enthusiastic, very diligent, and very eager, advocating 'unconditional ceasefire', 'shortening the war time', 'reducing the people's suffering', and 'taking saving the people as the premise', while we, apparently, are not nervous, not enthusiastic, not diligent, not eager, 'delaying time and prolonging the war'. But wait, gentlemen in Nanjing, we will become nervous, enthusiastic, and diligent. The war time can certainly be shortened, and the people's suffering can also be reduced. Since you have agreed to use our eight conditions as the basis for negotiations, you will all have to work hard to implement these eight points. It may take you, us, all democratic parties, people's organizations, and the people all over the country several months, half a year, a year, or five years to complete. We have the right to order you to re-arrest Okamura. The eight points that the gentlemen in Nanjing are listening to are not abstract conditions, but have concrete content. In this short period of time, it is important for everyone to think about it. The people will forgive the delay for a while. To be honest, the people's opinion is that we must prepare well. This negotiation must be held. Whoever stops in the middle and refuses to talk is absolutely not allowed. Therefore, your representatives must be prepared to come, but we still need some time to prepare. We do not allow the time for negotiation to be determined by war criminals. Because we are now working on an important task with the people of Peiping to peacefully resolve the Peiping issue. People in Peiping, such as General Fu Zuoyi, are also participating in this work. However, according to the communique of your news agency, you have admitted that this work is being done correctly. This work not only designated a location for peace talks, but also set an example for the peace issues of Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Gui Sui, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Changsha, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Taiwan, and Hainan Island. Therefore, this work should be praised. Gentlemen in Nanjing, you should not show an insufficiently solemn attitude towards this. We are consulting with various democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic figures, including those in our region and those in your region, on the list of war criminals, preparing the specific content of the first condition. This list will probably be announced soon. Dear gentlemen in Nanjing, you know that our democratic parties and people's organizations have not yet had time to discuss and officially announce such a list. Please forgive us for this. The reason is that your request for peace talks came a little late. If it had been earlier, perhaps we would have been ready. But you are not without things to do. In addition to arresting the Japanese war criminal Yasuji Okamura, you must continue to arrest a group of civil war criminals. First, arrest the 43 war criminals mentioned by a CCP authoritative figure, Li Ming, on December 25th last year. You must arrest them quickly and prevent them from escaping. You must take full responsibility. If there is any escape, it will be regarded as aiding bandits and will never be tolerated. We believe that only by arresting these war criminals can we shorten the war time and reduce the people's suffering. The existence of war criminals for one day will only prolong the war time and increase the people's suffering." Finally, it stated: "Regarding other conditions, we will notify Nanjing next time."</p>

<h3 id="e33">Stalin is Willing to Meet with Truman to Discuss the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty, Answering Four Questions from American Journalists <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[TASS, Moscow, 30th] Stalin's answers to the four questions raised by Mr. Smith, European General Manager of United Press International, received on January 27th are as follows: (Question) Is the Soviet government willing to consider issuing a joint statement with the US government guaranteeing that the two governments have no intention of resorting to war against each other? (Answer) The Soviet government is prepared to consider issuing such a statement. (Question) Is the Soviet government prepared to jointly adopt measures with the US government designed to implement such a peace treaty, such as gradually reducing armaments? (Answer) The Soviet government can, of course, cooperate with the US government in adopting pioneering measures for gradual disarmament designed to implement such a peace treaty. (Question) If the US, British, and French governments agree to postpone the establishment of a separate West Germany before the Foreign Ministers' Conference is convened to review the entire German question, will the Soviet government be prepared to remove the restrictions imposed by the Soviet authorities on traffic to Berlin and the western occupation zones of Germany? (Answer) If the US, Britain, and France comply with the conditions stated in the third question, the Soviet government believes that the lifting of transportation restrictions will not be hindered, but it should be based on a tacit understanding that the transportation and trade restrictions implemented by the three countries should also be lifted simultaneously. (Question) Are you prepared to meet with President Truman at a mutually convenient location to discuss the possibility of concluding such a peace treaty? (Answer) I have stated before that I have no objection to a meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 31st] Most non-communist Europeans expressed skepticism about Stalin's statement, but Sweden quickly suggested that any Stalin-Truman meeting be held in the Swedish capital. According to sources close to the Swedish Foreign Ministry, Sweden is willing to arrange the Stalin-Truman meeting.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] Stalin's statement closely follows two important Soviet diplomatic actions: the Soviet government's publication of a white paper denouncing the North Atlantic Treaty and the Soviet ambassador to Norway's inquiry into whether the Norwegian government would participate in the treaty. Some people believe that Mr. Shi's remarks, consistent with those of the French and Italian Communist leaders, seem to be a peace offensive and should not be trusted without factual evidence.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally said that Stalin's statement on US-Soviet relations is a significant event in international relations. He said that Stalin's statement of willingness to jointly guarantee with Truman to avoid war may indicate a new trend in international peace and harmony. "If this is his purpose, it will be welcomed by all who are concerned about peace and security and resolutely oppose aggression." House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom said that this statement cannot be completely ignored because this move will give the Soviet Union a propaganda victory. He said: "I do not agree to appease the Soviet Union in any way."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 30th] British diplomatic circles today expressed surprise at Stalin's remarks that he did not object to meeting with Truman. A Foreign Ministry spokesman believed that the implications of this talk were worth studying. Others believed that Mr. Shi wanted to contact the Truman government more directly with Moscow, disregarding Britain and France, or to shift attention from the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 29th broadcast from Moscow: The Soviet Union today released a white paper declaring to the world that the North Atlantic Treaty is part of a new war plan launched by Britain and the United States. The white paper condemned Britain and the United States for attempting to control the Far East, having no success in signing peace treaties with Japan and Germany, and pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty conspired to overthrow the United Nations in order to achieve the goal of Britain and the United States' forceful control of the world.</p>
<p>The white paper said that the British, French, Dutch, Belgian, and Luxembourg Western Union is an integral part of this British and American plan. It also said that Britain and the United States are attempting to isolate the Soviet Union, undermine the United Nations organization, implement economic sanctions against the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, and attempt to launch a new war.</p>
<p>This Soviet white paper was released a few hours after the five Western European countries announced their agreement to establish a European Parliament.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] Although the negotiations on the North Atlantic Treaty have encountered increasing opposition from the Soviet Union, the United States has decided to proceed with all its strength. It is reported that Secretary of State Acheson held a meeting with various advisors yesterday, and it is expected that Mr. Acheson will soon meet with the ambassadors of Canada and the five Western European countries, and the full text of the treaty will be announced soon.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Oslo, 30th] The tripartite defense talks among the three Nordic countries, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, concluded today, and a communique was issued announcing that despite sincere efforts, a treaty basis had not been found. The failure of the negotiations came after the Soviet Union exerted pressure on Norway. The three countries originally had different dreams in the same bed. Norway advocated participating in the West, Sweden advocated neutrality, and Denmark's attitude was undecided. The negotiations dragged on for several months. Soviet Ambassador Afanasyev yesterday questioned Norway's intention to join the North Atlantic Alliance and whether it would allow Western countries to use its military bases, intending to force Norway to choose between the East and the West. This move led to the failure of the three-nation negotiations. It is reported that the Soviet Union did not make the same representations to Sweden and Denmark. Norway's reply will be presented.</p>

The Security Council may convene a meeting within this biweekly period to consider this issue, at which time the Soviet spokesman is expected to speak first.

The Security Council, disregarding Dutch opposition, passed the joint proposal of the four countries, China, the United States, Cuba, and Norway. The Soviet Union suggested supplementing this case, advocating that the Dutch army should immediately withdraw to the positions stipulated in the Renville Truce Agreement, but only obtained four affirmative votes during the vote.</p>

<p>One theory is that his visit to Czechoslovakia has a special mission</p>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 30th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, who was rumored yesterday to be suffering from a severe nervous breakdown in a sanatorium in Carlsbad, was heard today to have recovered slightly and had left the sanatorium for several hours. (Moscow telecommunications did not mention Mr. Wei's arrival in Czechoslovakia or the news of his illness.) The servants in the hospital did not say where Mr. Wei went when he left the hospital today, but only said that he had not seen any guests. The Czech Foreign Ministry still said that it had not officially been informed that Mr. Wei had arrived in Czechoslovakia. It is rumored that Mr. Wei came here with the mission of creating disputes. It is said that Moscow believes that Czech President Gottwald's recent actions have failed to strictly adhere to his policies. One theory is that the Soviet Union asked him to allow some Germans to resettle in the Czech Republic, but Mr. Gao has refused directly. Although all the rumors have not been confirmed, many people believe them. There are also various rumors about Vyshinsky's illness. It is inconceivable what disease he is suffering from and why he came here. Mr. Wei once served as a cleansing prosecutor in the trial of anti-government factions, and his nervous system may have been affected as a result.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's report] The cost of various public utilities in this city has more than doubled due to the increase in the US exchange rate and the price of coal and oil, and the cost of living index has increased fivefold. In order to make up for the cost deficit, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau invited the heads of various companies to re-determine the new prices based on actual costs and submitted them to the mayor for approval.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration received a telegram yesterday from the Ministry of Transportation, ordering that, effective today (February 1st) at 00:00, passenger and freight rates on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines be adjusted, with a general increase of 400%, five times the original rate. The new ticket price for the express train from Nanjing to Shanghai is 960 yuan for first class, 480 yuan for second class, and 240 yuan for third class. The new ticket price for the express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou is 580 yuan for first class, 290 yuan for second class, and 145 yuan for third class.</p>
<p>Passenger transportation on both lines continues to be extremely chaotic due to the government's relocation and military transport. The number of passengers on trains from Shanghai to Nanjing has decreased, while trains going from Nanjing to Shanghai and Shanghai to Hangzhou remain extremely crowded. Train delays have not only failed to improve but have worsened. The train schedule is essentially useless. As train cars are being moved south with the government, there is a temporary lack of circulation and an extreme shortage. The original daily train schedule is often suspended or temporarily reassigned, so in reality, passenger transportation on both lines is currently in a semi-paralyzed state, and it is difficult to expect improvement in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Shipping Industry Association, in view of the recent soaring prices and the allocation of coal also rising by 150%, finds it difficult for shipping companies to maintain operations. The association's directors and supervisors, at a joint meeting last Friday, resolved to increase passenger and freight rates by 60% starting today. Furthermore, according to company representatives, even with the 60% increase today, it will still be difficult to maintain operations given the current price levels, even if we increased another 60%.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The five senior merchant marine crew groups, in order to protect navigation rights and promote navigation in North China to prevent foreign ships from taking advantage of the situation, resolved at a meeting yesterday to issue a declaration. They demanded that the government unconditionally allow national ships to navigate in North China to demonstrate respect for national sovereignty. They requested that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) provide increased protection to national ships upon arrival. They also hoped that both authorities would avoid military transport as much as possible in the future to prevent misunderstandings and damages. They requested that shipping companies rise to the occasion, regardless of cargo availability or other difficulties, to provide ships and promptly initiate navigation to fulfill their undeniable responsibility. All crew members also resolved to contribute their utmost efforts to accomplish the heroic task of escorting the ships. It is reported that shipping companies have also decided to immediately dispatch ships to navigate to various ports in North China, and once customs clearance procedures are completed, the voyages can begin.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] At approximately 0:50 PM on the 30th of last month, a group of soldiers suddenly entered the China Grand Theater on Niuzhuang Road without tickets. When on-site military police officers tried to dissuade them without success, a service handgun of one of the military police officers was stolen.

<h3 id="e55">Forced Landing? Or Other Motives? China National Aviation Corporation Passenger Plane Missing: Found at Jinan Airport <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] A China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) C-47 type XT-135 Shanghai-Qingdao flight disappeared on the 30th of last month while en route from Shanghai to Qingdao. It was later discovered in Jinan, which is under Communist control. The plane took off from Shanghai at 8:50 AM and lost contact at 11:00 AM. After the company authorities discovered this, they dispatched three planes, XT-42, 34, and 114, to search separately. At 4:00 PM, they finally found the plane parked in the Jinan airport. From the air, the plane number and markings were clearly visible, and the situation seemed quite intact with no one around.</p>
<p>The plane was piloted by foreign pilot Hassig, co-pilot Shu Zhitou, and radio operator Wang Qingyuan, with 17 passengers, including two foreigners. According to the company spokesperson, the passenger list could not be released because the company was closed for the holiday yesterday, and no one was working in the relevant departments. However, to his knowledge, there were no important figures among them, and most were going to Qingdao for business.</p>
<p>The company authorities are now waiting for developments and hope to receive news from Jinan so they can negotiate everything. As for the reason why the plane landed in Jinan, the company spokesperson declined to make any speculations. Jinan is more than 200 miles from Qingdao. Usually, the Shanghai-Qingdao route can fly directly along the coast, but it can also pass through Jinan. General speculation is that the plane may have encountered Communist aircraft or had Communist personnel on board, leading to a forced landing. As for mechanical failure, aviation industry insiders believe that if the plane had a problem, it would have been better to maintain course to Qingdao or return to Shanghai rather than landing in Jinan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Qingdao, 30th] A CNAC C47 XT135 passenger plane, carrying 17 passengers, including Chen Linwen, director of the Qingdao Naval Shipyard, departed from Shanghai for Qingdao at 7:50 AM on the 30th and disappeared en route. The Qingdao CNAC authorities immediately dispatched four planes to search separately. At 2:50 PM, the plane was found safely parked on the western part of the northeast runway of Jinan Airport. The search plane circled four times at a low altitude of 500 feet and observed that the plane was parked properly and without damage. Communist soldiers were covering it with black mats. The wings and the right side of the tail had already been covered. There were many Communist soldiers at the airport. According to CNAC personnel, the weather in East China today was excellent, and the plane should not have been forced to land, suggesting that there must be other underlying reasons.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Previous Month's Lower Period Index: 88.47 Times. Two Types of Indices Will Be Compiled and Published in the Future. <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Shanghai Municipal Employee Living Expense Index Compilation and Review Committee held a meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, chaired by Statistics Director Chu Yifei. Representatives from the Federation of Labor Unions, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Industrial Association, among others, attended the meeting. The chairman began by stating that there are many compilation agencies in the city, but the methods used and the prices adopted vary slightly, and coordination has recently been achieved. In the future, the index will use the index from the first half of January as a fixed base period, as the "August 19th" prices can only serve as a base price. Therefore, the index released today has two versions: (1) the old index, which still uses the "August 19th" prices as the base price, is 88.47 times. (2) the new index, which uses the first half of January as the base period, is 1.84 times. Starting in February, the old index will no longer be calculated. In the future, there will be two types of indices published: A. the fixed base period index, which uses the first half of January as the base period. B. the chain index (i.e., the comparison between two consecutive periods).</p>
<p>Employee Salary: Three Methods</p>
<p>Regarding the method of paying employees' salaries, the following three methods can be used, and the results will have no impact on the actual salary received. (1) For those who use the "August 19th" base salary, they will still use the old index to pay salaries, or multiply the new index by 48.04 times as the salary figure. (2) Change the base salary to the "August 19th" base salary multiplied by 48.04 times, as the base salary for the first half of January 1949, and then multiply it by the newly established fixed base period index to pay salaries (i.e., using the first half of January 1949 as the base period). (3) Starting in February, the chain index can be adopted, that is, the actual salary paid in the previous period is multiplied by the chain index.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in view of recent price fluctuations, which have severely affected employees' purchasing power, Chu proposed to the Bureau of Social Affairs to establish a wage-price review committee so that prices and wages can be more appropriately adjusted. To make the index more reasonable in the future, the price of the day before the index is published will also be included in the calculation. The monthly publication date will still be the 15th and the end of the month. After Chu's report, the committee members carefully reviewed and discussed the matter and unanimously approved it, signing on the index sheet. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>The total employee living expense index and classification index for the second half of January, including both the new index and the old index, are listed separately below:</p>
<p>(A) Based on the prices of "August 19th" in 1937, the values of the total index and classification index (provisionally named "Old Index"):</p>
<p>Total Index...88.47</p>
<p>Classification Index:</p>
<p>Food Category...86.98</p>
<p>Clothing Category...75.62</p>
<p>Water, Electricity, Fuel, and Housing Category...96.17</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Category...90.10</p>
<p>(B) Based on the first half of January 1949</p>
<p>as the base period, the values of the total index and classification index (provisionally named "New Index"):</p>
<p>Total Index...1.84</p>
<p>Classification Index:</p>
<p>Food Category...1.98</p>
<p>Clothing Category...1.30</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Regarding the case of revising the pawn interest rate and the request of the Pawnbrokers Association to waive the prohibited handling fee, the Bureau of Social Affairs submitted two resolutions from the previous municipal meeting: (1) forward a letter to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that the capital amount of the pawn industry be re-specified. (2) Regarding whether the handling fee should be prohibited, the Bureau of Social Affairs shall convene representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Pawnbrokers Association to discuss the matter jointly. At yesterday morning's regular municipal meeting, the Bureau of Social Affairs forwarded a telegram from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that all pawnbrokers are willing to allocate a portion of the current pawn interest rate as a handling fee, which should not increase the burden on pawn customers, so it seems feasible. The case has been discussed and approved by the municipal meeting.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The detained students Shi Jiapu, Chen Mingde, and 16 others were all released on bail on the afternoon of January 28th after a hunger strike and appeals, as well as efforts by university presidents and parents. They were released from prison on Lunar New Year's Eve after five months of detention, allowing them to reunite with their families for the New Year. At this point, of the large group of students arrested on August 27th of last year, all have been released except for Duan Ze of Tongji University, who is still in custody due to his six-month sentence not yet being completed.</p>
<p>These eighteen students were detained and interrogated by the Special Criminal Court on August 27th of last year on suspicion of being "Communist spies" and detained at the Penglai Sub-Bureau. Due to insufficient evidence, they were not prosecuted but were also not released. On December 24th of last year, the Special Criminal Court transferred the case to the Garrison Command for handling in accordance with the Martial Law. After five months in prison, they longed for home and, due to the long-term detention, their physical and mental health deteriorated. Therefore, they launched a hunger strike appeal on January 20th. Later, with the guarantee of university presidents and parents, they negotiated with the authorities and, after being persuaded, resumed eating on the 23rd while awaiting orders. After the university presidents and parents made petitions and repeatedly visited Mayor Wu, Mayor Wu agreed to release them immediately on the morning of the 28th. On the afternoon of the same day, all the students were released on bail. The Garrison Command transported them from the Penglai Road Police Bureau to the Garrison Command for release, where their parents picked them up and reunited for the New Year.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Furthermore, three professors representing the Fudan University Faculty Association, Chen Guyuan, Chen Wangdao, and Pan Zhenya, brought a large number of candies to the Penglai Police Bureau on the morning of the 28th to visit the eighteen detained students, and also visited Chen Siwei, a professor at the China Industrial and Commercial Vocational School who was arrested in late November of last year, for a discussion of about half an hour.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Collison Between Taiping and Jian Yuan Ships Sinks Both: Over a Thousand People Drown, Thirty-Eight Rescued <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] On the night before Lunar New Year's Eve, that is, at 11:45 PM on January 27th, the Taiping, a ship of the Zhonglian Company operating between Shanghai and Keelung, suddenly collided with the Jian Yuan, a ship of the Yiqun Company carrying goods from Keelung to Shanghai, in the waters near the Zhoushan Islands, more than 40 nautical miles from Shanghai. As a result, both ships sank. Only two of the 74 crew members on the Jian Yuan were rescued. Only 36 of the more than 1,000 crew members and passengers on the Taiping were rescued. This is another major tragedy this year following the Jiangya ship incident.</p>
<p>According to surviving passengers of the Taiping, the Taiping was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the morning of the 27th. However, a batch of steel bars weighing 600 tons had to be loaded and transported, which took a long time. After loading 150 tons, it was discovered that the deadweight had exceeded the specified waterline of the ship. At that time, the crew members requested that they stop loading, but the ship's business director insisted on loading 450 tons after all of the freight for the steel bars had been collected, and then the ship departed. The departure time was delayed until 4:15 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e62">No Fog or Wind at Sea: Cause of Collision Unknown <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Since the ship still wanted to arrive in Keelung before the scheduled time, it was traveling at a very high speed after leaving port and did not follow the prescribed route, but instead took a shortcut. According to the passenger, the Taiping arrived near the Zhoushan Islands at 11:45 PM. There was no fog or wind at sea, but it is unimaginable why it collided with the Jian Yuan, which was coming from the opposite direction. He recalled that in addition to the Taiping's excessive speed and incorrect route, the signal lights on the mast were also not lit. The Jian Yuan's route also did not seem to comply with the regulations. Therefore, the position of the two ships at the time of the collision was at a right angle. The bow of the Taiping struck the rear port quarter two-fifths portion of the Jian Yuan. Both ships did not sound their whistles prior to the incident. The Jian Yuan was brightly lit after being hit, and the crew members jumped into the water to ask the Taiping for help. The ship sank completely within 15 minutes. The Taiping was unable to quickly release the lifeboats, so it rescued two people with wooden planks. When it was discovered that the ship's own cabins were also taking on water, it turned back to a nearby small island at full speed. However, at this time, the ship was gradually tilting to the right and sinking. When the tilt reached about 40 degrees, the sound of the ship's engine stopped. Before the Taiping's hull took on water, all the passengers heard the noise and woke up, rushing to the top deck and shouting for help. When the bow gradually sank, a large ship was suddenly spotted one Chinese mile away, possibly attracted by the shouting. The ship shone a strong spotlight in the direction of the Taiping, but it quickly extinguished and continued sailing without coming to the rescue. According to the passengers' subsequent investigation, the ship seemed to be the Zhongxing ship sailing from Keelung to Shanghai, as its direction and time of travel matched the Zhongxing. After that ship left, the Taiping tilted even more. In less than half an hour, it finally capsized, and all the passengers on the top deck were crushed into the sea. Thirty-six of them were able to cling to wooden planks and boxes, drifting with the waves until 6:30 AM on the 28th, when an Australian warship arrived and rescued them one by one after receiving a distress call. All the other passengers have likely been buried at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>The number of goods carried on the Jian Yuan was said to be only 2,000 tons of coal, plus 74 crew members. The Taiping registered 508 passengers and 124 crew members, plus about 1,000 people, including those who boarded without tickets ("yellow fish").

<p>Families of the Victims Petition the Authorities</p>
<p>After the tragedy, the families of the victims of the Taiping formed committees in both Taiwan and Shanghai to handle the aftermath. The number of family members registered in Taiwan is already 240, and the number registered in Shanghai is more than 500. Representatives of the families of the victims in Shanghai, Chang Zichun, Wang Yi, Gong Yunbiao, Zhou Guohua, Zhu Minghe, Deng Erqian, Wu Zongji, Mao Zhaowen'e, etc., went to the municipal government to meet with Mayor Wu, but there was no result. Today, they will each send four representatives from both Shanghai and Taiwan to petition the municipal government, the municipal council, and the security authorities, demanding a thorough investigation of the truth of the accident and urging them to handle the aftermath. In addition, in response to the demands of the families, Zhonglian Company also dispatched the "Haichuan" ship yesterday afternoon to carry more than 100 family members to the site of the accident for inspection.</p>
<p>Report and Appeal to All Sectors Yesterday</p>
<p>In order to make the truth clear to all sectors, the bereaved families held a reception for reporters at Zhonglian Company yesterday afternoon and reported several points: (1) According to various facts, the collision was caused by negligence of duty by the Taiping authorities in good weather, which is unprecedented in the history of navigation in our country. (2) Both the Taiping and Jian Yuan ships were overage, and the life-saving equipment was also incomplete. The Jian Yuan had an accident near Taiwan and had not yet been repaired before it sailed. (3) After the accident, the "Taiping" would send a distress call, but the Shanghai maritime authorities and Zhonglian Company never sent ships to rescue them. Finally, they said that they would issue several appeals to all parties: (1) demand that the authorities of the two ships immediately conduct rescue operations, search for survivors, and salvage the dead. (2) In addition to being liable for all legal responsibilities, the company authorities should immediately provide relief to the families of the victims. (3) The company authorities should promptly announce the exact location of the accident of the two ships. (4) The maritime authorities should strengthen measures to prevent accidents and strictly rectify navigation ethics. (5) Hope that the authorities will thoroughly investigate the truth of the accident and publish it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Taipei, 31st] After the Taiping ship accident, most of the passengers' families were in Taiwan. A committee for the aftermath has been organized, and ten representatives have been sent to Shanghai to investigate the truth. The families believe that the accident was caused by careless driving and that the company should be responsible. They have petitioned the police station to request the provisional attachment of the property of Zhonglian's Taiwan branch and that the manager be released on bail and put forward the terms of compensation.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 3:25 PM yesterday, a French-operated tram (car number 106) heading west reached Dongxin Bridge station. A dozen or so soldiers of an unknown unit attempted to board. However, the car was already packed with passengers. As driver number 365, hearing the bell signal to proceed, was about to continue onward, the soldiers became dissatisfied. One of them drew a gun and fired three shots at the tram. Fortunately, the passengers dodged effectively, and only one person was injured. In the chaos, the soldier who fired and his companions took the opportunity to escape. The tram immediately stopped service and reported the incident to the company. Upon hearing this news, all subsequent trams and those heading east halted service in protest, causing a complete transportation disruption. Upon receiving the report, the responsible police precinct dispatched officers to investigate. The injured passenger, identified as Chen Jingyuan, 28, from Chaozhou, residing at 249 Xiangyang South Road, was sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the New Year's charity football match, China United played Western United yesterday afternoon at Yiyuan.

<h3 id="e77">The Transforming Gansu-Sichuan Border: Zhuoni in the Tibetan Region: A Sideline Account of Commander Yang Fuxing's Reception <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 26th (Airmail)] Perhaps it was due to the similar ages of the host and guests, or perhaps it was because the host belonged to a different ethnic group, but this reporter found Commander Yang Fuxing's reception fresh and meaningful. Everyone casually discussed everything about the area of the Tibetan people, who numbered more than one hundred thousand and were engaged in both farming and herding, as if discussing exotic news: marriage, currency, area, population, livelihood, customs, religion, politics, and even the ancestral practice of kneeling in greeting, all became targets of everyone's questions. Through this series of questions, everyone satisfied their curiosity, as if they had taken a trip abroad. Most valuable was Mr. Yang Shenghua's systematic introduction.</p>
<p>Why Commander Yang Fuxing is named Yang</p>
<p>He first explained the origin of the name "Che Ni." Originally, the Zhuoni region was densely forested, and rich in Masson pines. The Tibetan word for Masson pine is "Zhuoni." The Tibetans used "Zhuoni" as a characteristic to refer to this area. The neighboring Han people inherited this name, forming the name of this place that everyone knows today. The Tibetans here migrated from Tibet. Their first ancestor was named Xie'erde. He later became the local chieftain, inheriting the position for generations. It was not until the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty that the emperor summoned him and bestowed the surname Yang. This is the origin of Commander Yang's surname, Yang.</p>
<p>The hereditary chieftain has existed for twenty generations</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, Commander Yang's ancestor was granted the hereditary title of Vice Commissioner. In successive disturbances, he always stood on the side of protecting the people and maintaining local stability. In 1936, Commander Yang's father was killed by local ruffians colluding with Han people from a neighboring area. At that time, the central government sent Mr. Tian Kunshan to handle the matter. Because the local people firmly opposed rule by outsiders, they unanimously supported Commander Yang Fuxing to inherit his father's position. The central government accepted the public opinion and appointed the young Yang Fuxing as Security Commander. This hereditary chieftain system has existed for twenty generations. Commander Yang often encourages himself to seek ways to maintain their glory and achievements, and dares not slack off for a moment. Every few months, they come to Lanzhou to stay for a while in order to understand the external situation and learn all new knowledge. They are working hard to adapt to the new era, and are trying to improve education and life. Although the current situation does not allow them to seek new happiness, they can only passively seek to reduce the suffering and burden of the people.</p>
<p>Zhuoni District uses both political and religious governance</p>
<p>Finally, he talked about the relationship between politics and religion in the Zhuoni district and how it differs from the Tibetan region of Xiahe. The local customary law is this: if the Tusi (chieftain) has one son, then he simultaneously holds the great power of both political and religious affairs. If there are two sons, the elder son will hold political power and the second son will hold religious power. If there are further sons, they become heads of hundreds or thousands of households. As for the difference between Zhuoni and Xiahe, the political power is larger than religious power in Zhuoni, while Xiahe is the opposite, where religious power is supreme, and political power is below religious power.</p>
<p>There are forty-eight banners and more than ten elementary schools</p>
<p>The Zhuoni district now has forty-eight banners, each banner with from two to three hundred to five to six hundred households. There are currently more than ten elementary schools. Times have finally progressed. Students in those schools no longer need to be forced to attend like corvee laborers, but the people's habits and consciousness are still the same as before. When they meet Commander Yang, they still kneel on the ground. If they refuse to kneel, it will be considered that they look down on him.</p>
<p>A major transformation of the era has produced a new understanding</p>
<p>In any case, Commander Yang, who has just returned from training in Nanjing, knows that the times are changing every day, and progressing every day. When the reporter asked if his younger brother, Danzhu Hutukgang, could also get married, he smiled and said, "Not now, maybe in ten years it will be possible." From this one sentence, people can already see that this young commander has no plans and doesn't even want to cling to the past. In this major transformation of the era, it is truly commendable that a descendant of a Tusi can have this kind of understanding! (Han Guocui)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Guilin Spring Welcoming Melody <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Our newspaper reporter Liang Yushan</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Guilin, 25th] After the President's New Year's Day address, the whole country was ecstatic. Everyone had a common wish and belief. The long-silent mountain city suddenly became active. The east called for peace, and the west echoed with peace. Today there was a peace conference, and tomorrow there will be another peace conference, making this southern corner seem like the center of political gravity. The members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, National Assembly members, and members of the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party, as well as representatives from various public opinion organizations such as the provincial and municipal assemblies who are staying in Guilin, all unanimously promote peace.</p>
<p>Indeed, the prices of goods these days are very satisfactory. Only two days after the news of the President's retirement was released, rice, which had been 500 yuan per dan, plummeted to 300 yuan. Gold retreated from 12 to 11.10, retreating steadily. The yuan fell sharply from a high of 170 to 140 yuan. Shops are busy selling goods, believing that peace will be realized and prices will fall. The only exception to the price declines this week is haircuts. As the abolished lunar new year approaches, "rich or poor, get a haircut for the new year," so the price is raised.</p>
<p>The sun has been scorching in recent days, with a gentle breeze, and the temperature has risen from zero degrees to above fifty degrees. Pedestrians are lightly dressed, wearing only shirts, as if it were early spring. Shops are busy decorating their facades, and everyone is playing a melody to welcome spring.</p>
<p>Since the President's retirement, the atmosphere of peace has become stronger. Legislative member Lin Hu and others staying in Guilin expressed their opinions, praising the President's retirement as far-sighted, wise, and decisive. Vice President Li's assumption of the arduous task of maintaining the situation meets popular expectations and is believed to be successful. Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members and National Assembly members responded to the organization of the Peace Promotion Association by Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members and National Assembly members in Nanjing, while at the same time exchanging opinions with various agencies and people's organizations in the city. They all believed that the President's retirement had a great impact on war and peace, and the situation has since turned around, with the distance between the two sides gradually closing. The trend of the times, the unanimous demand of the people, and the desire for peace are bound to be realized; it is only a matter of time. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed President, Vice President, and the two Presidents of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong and Sun Tong, urging both sides to immediately lay down their arms and send representatives to Beijing to negotiate peace with people from the various opposition parties and representatives from the provincial and municipal councils, to negotiate everything in order to safeguard national rights, protect the freedom of the people, and achieve economic equality. In short, all measures should be based on the power of the people.</p>
<p>Paying attention to national affairs by ordinary people shows where the people's hearts lie. In recent days, there have been groups of readers looking at wall newspapers on the streets and at the doors of newspapers. Libraries and all places with newspapers have been filled with people awaiting news of peace, praying for the arrival of the gods of peace and freedom.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Wujin, 26th] Taixiang received an order from the Jiangfang Department last month to requisition ten civilian ships in the territory, each with a load of more than fifteen tons. The ten households whose ships were requisitioned, including Wang Kun Da and others, had all their ships assigned to the river defense chain. As a result, the families of all ten ships have nowhere to live and are in dire straits. On the 25th, they collectively walked from the river defense area to Changzhou and submitted a petition to the county government, requesting relief. The county government deeply sympathized and immediately ordered the Chamber of Commerce to estimate the value of the ships, totaling 815 dan of rice, and ordered them to find ways to raise funds. The person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce agreed to pay off all the funds within the abolished lunar new year. The method of raising funds is to be proposed by all industries.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Amidst the Evacuation: Chatting Casually about Fuzhou <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Zheng Shizhu</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 25th (Airmail)] Since the New Year in 1941, Fuzhou has been like a nouveau riche, panicking and at a loss. This time, the central government has stepped up its evacuation efforts, but the capacity of Taiwan and Guangzhou has already been saturated, so it has to retreat to the more moderate cities in the southeast. In history, Fuzhou has always ranked third or fourth rate. Some people said that Shanghai's civilization is half a century behind New York, and that Fuzhou is fifty years behind Shanghai. Although this statement may not be entirely accurate, it is probably not far off. However, since the recovery of Taiwan, which is closely related to Fujian, Taiwan's position has become increasingly important, giving rise to new value to the adjacent mainland. In the future, the center of gravity of war and peace will definitely not be in the southwest. Fuzhou is located between Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, and Guangzhou, and should be a new stronghold. The Communist Party once broadcast that it would capture Fuzhou in May, which shows that great minds think alike, and the Communist army has also noticed the importance of this growing small city in the near future.</p>
<p>Evacuation plan is like an arrow leaving the bow</p>
<p>To remedy the shortcomings of inland transportation, the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway is said to be starting soon, and highways will be actively improved, but this is not a quick fix, and it is not easy to talk about in the short term. Under the slogan of "being able to fight before talking about peace", the government's evacuation plan is like an arrow leaving the bow, and the advance personnel of the Joint Logistics Headquarters and the Ministry of National Defense have also arrived one after another. At this time, the chairmen of the three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong were replaced. Zhu Shaoliang, as the Pacification Director of Fuzhou, concurrently served as the head of Fujian Province, in coordination with Chen Cheng in Taiwan and Xue Yue in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Mixed families, chaotic and cramped</p>
<p>So far, almost all usable and rentable houses in Fuzhou, from the city to the suburbs, have been occupied. The families of government and military agencies have used every possible means to move into housing that can barely accommodate them. Even now, many families are still living a mixed family life on the floors of evacuation stations. A chaotic and uneasy mood generally envelops the hearts of every displaced person. Single people, with nothing to do during the evacuation period, spend their days wandering the streets, while those burdened with families are busy with the division of labor, arranging the most basic and simple living space. This is an awkward picture.</p>
<p>Prosperity opportunities, expressing welcome</p>
<p>Amidst this severe housing shortage, there is a lovely episode: a coastal town about seventy kilometers east of Fuzhou openly welcomes the relocation of evacuation agencies or larger schools, citing beautiful scenery and convenient transportation, showing that some people cherish this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for prosperity.</p>
<p>Peace talks, hoping for something</p>
<p>The people of Fuzhou are simple and old-fashioned. Not many men wear neat suits. The situation today seems to have changed slightly. Even more women are wearing suit pants than men who used to wear suits, although their number is still far less than that of the soldiers in grass green uniforms on the streets. However, the bright colors of the clothes they brought from Beijing and Shanghai are more than adequate.</p>
<p>The call for peace talks is very loud, and people are looking forward to a new situation. Some people are calling for the suspension of work at the Yixu Airport in Fuzhou, hoping that the agencies will temporarily stop evacuating, as abnormal prosperity and chaotic relocation will only cause adverse consequences.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Detailed Account of the Wuxi Bloodshed: Military Officer's Unrequited Love Leads to Murder of Mistress; Opera Singer Zhang Yuyan and Husband Tragically Killed; Perpetrator Flees to Nanjing, Still at Large <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Shi Wuwei</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi dispatch, 26th] Since winter began, although martial law has been in effect in Wuxi, reports of robbery and theft continue unabated. Furthermore, a series of bloody incidents has occurred, significantly impacting social order. Yesterday morning, at 4:00 AM, during the martial law period, two more homicides occurred. One was in the southern suburbs, where watchman Guo Yulin was killed by thieves. The other was a crime of passion. A young military officer, taking advantage of his ability to move freely while wearing martial law attire during the curfew, was able to act deliberately and escape without hindrance. This officer, named Zhang Jiming, had become deeply infatuated with the Peking Opera actress Zhang Yuyan, to the point of developing possessive desires. Unfortunately, love cannot be forced upon one party. After repeated threats elicited no response, the officer, in despair, conceived the intention to kill, using a handgun to fatally shoot his beloved and her romantic rival.</p>
<p>**Beautiful Actress, Military Officer Pursues**</p>
<p>The deceased Zhang Yuyan was 19 years old and the adopted daughter of martial arts actor Zhang Yuting and Zhang Shaoyan. She began learning opera at the age of nine and was betrothed to Zhao Qingsheng (whose brother is Zhao Songqiao), a student of Yuting, at the age of eleven, although they were not often together. After the victory [end of WWII], Zhang and his daughter joined the "Chunqiu Opera Troupe" sponsored by the 58th Army, performing in Nansuzhou. At the time, Yuyan's beauty and artistic skills were considered top-notch, and she was very popular with audiences. Zhang Jiming, then the head of the Political Affairs Brigade of the Traffic Police Headquarters stationed in Suzhou, saw Zhang dressed up and was struck by her celestial beauty, immediately harboring desires for her. He tried various methods, initially becoming friendly with Yuting, then offering embroidered cushions as gifts, and finally, sparing no expense, he organized the "Universal Opera Troupe," appointing Zhang Yuting as the director. Zhang, lured by fame and fortune, resigned from the Chunqiu Opera Troupe and led Yuyan and others back to Nanjing to perform on the central stage of the Victory Hall in Jieshou Hall.</p>
<p>**Warm Concern, Love Blossoms**</p>
<p>Before long, Jiming also resigned from his position in the Suqian Political Affairs Team and went to Nanjing to dedicate himself to the development of the Universal Opera Troupe. After a month of performances, Yuyan suddenly fell ill with a lung ailment. Jiming felt his opportunity had arrived and encouraged her to stop performing. He first persuaded Yuting to take the troupe back to Wuxi, then sent Yuyan to the hospital for treatment. Jiming showed her thoughtful care day and night, and from this, love blossomed. After recovering from her illness, she went on a honeymoon trip to Wuhu with him, living together as husband and wife. Until March of last year, at Yuting's repeated urging, Zhang and Yuyan came to Wuxi and performed under the name of the Universal Opera Troupe at the China Opera House on Huiquan Nongqiao. A month later, they returned to Wuhu. Yuting and Zhao Qingsheng and their families remained in Wuxi. Due to difficulty finding housing, they temporarily stayed at Room 11 of the Dongxin Hotel, with Zhao living alone in Room 12. Later, Yuyan also came to Wuxi alone at the end of December, living with Zhao, and then performed at the Middle East Opera House, holding the leading role.</p>
<p>**Losing Sight of Her, Love Drifting Away**</p>
<p>However, Jiming never saw his beloved return from then on, longing for her until his eyes were dry. He visited Wuxi three times to urge her to return to Wuhu, but Yuting forcefully prevented him by making excuses. Zhang made fruitless trips back and forth. He then sent three more letters urging her, but they were ignored. By the time the fourth letter arrived, its wording revealed his anger and resentment. Yuting, realizing that it was impossible to hide the truth, replied to Jiming, directly telling him that his young daughter Yuyan had been betrothed to Zhao Qingsheng since childhood, and that he should no longer think of Yuyan in the future. After receiving the letter, Zhang realized that his money and love had all drifted away, and the intention to kill arose from this.</p>
<p>**Actress Faithless, Seeks Revenge from Afar**</p>
<p>Several days ago, Jiming came to Wuxi from Nanjing, staying at the Taishan Hotel. After secretly investigating the location of Yuyan and her husband, at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, carrying a six-inch Browning pistol with a loaded chamber, he went directly to the Dongxin Hotel under the cover of martial law. He knocked on the door and entered, only to find Yuyan and Zhao embracing and sleeping together, which ignited his jealousy. Without a word, he raised his gun and fired at them, each of them being shot three times. One bullet struck Yuyan in her right breast, and the bullet did not exit, killing her instantly. Zhao suffered four gunshot wounds in his large intestine and stomach, and his life was in critical danger. By the time Yuting heard the noise and rushed out, Jiming had already calmly gone downstairs and escaped. He immediately reported to the security authorities and sent the injured to Dahua Hospital for treatment. He was pronounced dead at 8:00 AM on the 26th. After daybreak, he filed a formal report with the local district prosecutor, requesting an autopsy, accompanied by the local neighborhood head. It is reported that the perpetrator is currently serving in the Capital Garrison Headquarters, and the city defense department has dispatched personnel to track him down and arrest him.</p>

<p>**Wuxi**</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] As the lunar year draws to a close and the New Year approaches, local defenses have been strengthened, and the people are spending the Spring Festival in peace. In the city's Chong'an Temple Park, there are throngs of visitors.</p>
<p>[Also reported] The General Headquarters of the Industry and Commerce Self-Defense Corps was established on February 1st. The eastern, western, southern, and northern district brigades have already been established and are implementing defense measures. Also, the joint defense office of the third, fourth, and fifth bao [neighborhood units] of the southern suburbs near Taihu Lake's Xuelangxiang Banqiao was suddenly attacked by local communists at around 2:00 AM on the 28th. Fifteen rifles, three automatic rifles, one pistol, one Mauser pistol, five steel helmets, ten bayonets, and fifteen ammunition belts were seized, and the chief and deputy directors Yang Bo and Zhang Hongxiang were taken away, but were soon released and returned.</p>
<p>**Jiangyin**</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] The river defenses on the southern bank of Cheng [Jiangyin] are solid and well-guarded. Warships are stationed in the river, the market is calm, and the people are spending the Spring Festival peacefully. In addition, refugees are crowding the area. The land around Cheng County is poor, and how to provide relief to these people is a difficult problem.</p>
<p>**Wujin**</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] At around 4:00 PM on the 25th, Wuyi Motor Company's Car No. 11 was returning to Changzhou from Caoqiao when it was suddenly stopped near Fenghuang Bridge by plainclothes agents claiming to be "New Fourth Army" who fired shots and ordered the car to stop. After the car stopped, the plainclothes agents boarded the car, inspected it, and then asked a driver to go with them. There was nothing else. Three passengers were injured by stray bullets, but their injuries were not serious. It is generally speculated that this action was intended to threaten the company and demand public grain. Cars are still running on this route as usual.</p>
<p>**Beiqiao**</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] The Shanghai County Council recently sent a telegram to the whole country responding to Acting President Li's peaceful proclamation, urging the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to immediately cease fire to achieve comprehensive peace.</p>
<p>[Also reported] Shanghai County Councilor Zhang Yi and people from Zhuanqiao, recognizing the importance of vocational education, have obtained approval from the Department of Education to establish a county-run junior vocational middle school in Zhuanqiao Town. It will initially have agricultural and commercial departments and is scheduled to open on February 6th.</p>
<p>**Changde**</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] The six highway lines from Yongshun to Yongshui, Yuanjiang to Yiyang, Hanshou to Taizimiao, Changde to Cili, Lixian to Cili, and Cili to Dayong will be open to traffic in early March. The construction of the lines from Dayong to Sangzhi, Sangzhi to Longshan, Huarong to Nanxian, Nanxian to Anxiang, and Anxiang to Lixian will begin soon.</p>
<p>**Jinhua**</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Transportation Office has noted that the passenger cars on both the up and down trains are extremely crowded, and unscrupulous people are often mixed in, hoping to ride the train without a ticket, causing chaotic station and train conditions. To rectify this and increase revenue, the time for checking tickets on first and second class express trains at Jinhua Station is set at one hour. For other passenger trains, the time can be adjusted depending on the actual situation, and the Jinhua Station will work with the military police joint inspection team to thoroughly enforce this.</p>
