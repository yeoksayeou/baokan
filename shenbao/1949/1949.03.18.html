<h3 id="c1">政院組織法或將覆議　新閣組成可能有待　盧作孚長交通何自兼國防徐堪蟬聯　副院長人選尚在徵約中 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕何應欽新閣閣員人選，正逐步邀約決定中。交長已邀盧作孚出任，國防部長由何氏自兼，財長仍由徐堪蟬聯；惟截至十七日晚盧氏及預定中之外長傅秉常兩氏之答覆，均未抵京，而吳貽芳博士則已於十七日謝絕入閣。目前除司法行政部·內政·國防三部已定外，餘五部二會均未決定，而經濟部以職權龐大，尤影響出任之人選。十七日晚聞立委方面可能就經濟部問題提出覆議，如是則新閣組成日期，顯尚有待。何氏十七日竟日在官邸接見賓客，陳誠·王陵基·朱紹良·楊森等曾先後往訪。若干人士對陳誠能在新閣籌組期中蒞京，表示欣慰，認為有助於新閣之籌組工作。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京十七日電〕何院長應欽十七日繼續與國民黨高級方面討論組閣事宜，新閣之組成諒在下週初，據接近何氏方面消息：迄十七日薄暮止，組閣進行情形如下：（一）張羣·張治中·吳忠信等內定為不管部之政務委員，（二）吳鐵城仍堅拒入閣。（三）何院長邀薛篤弼出任副院長。薛氏尚未接受。（四）黃紹竑被邀出任秘書長，黃氏尚未接受。（五）倪烱聲仍將出任副秘書長。（六）傅秉常及若干其他人士被提及出任外長，但何院長迄未正式邀請傅氏出任此職。（七）何院長擬自兼國防部長。（八）徐堪曾內定為財長，但以監院之反對，最後可能另選他人。（九）盧作孚被邀出任交通部長，盧氏未接受。（十）章士劍接受司法行政部長。（十一）吳貽芳拒絕出任教育部長，另行人選在考慮中。（十二）戴愧生將連任僑務委會主席。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京十七日電〕何應欽十七日已必須改變其組閣之計劃，因立院拒絕重行考慮其減少部會數目之行動。據接近政院人士稱：減裁內閣部會數目為十之法案將延遲何氏完成組閣之努力。何應欽及代總統李宗仁十六日曾采取勸說立院重行考慮彼等之行動。李宗仁十六日夜召集陳顧遠等立委廿二人至其官邸，但未能使立委相信廢除或修改已三讀之法案為妥切之舉。據悉陳顧遠雖對政府表示同情之立場，但認為重行考慮此法案所必要之程序「太為繁複」，因而拒絕采取行動。總統及行政院長是否將再勸說立院修正其決定，現尚在未定之天。如何應欽接受所決定之新法案，則渠可邀請非國民黨人士入閣給予不管部閣員之職藉以實現其原來計劃。</p>
<p>〔本報廣州十七日電〕張羣稱，渠一二天後卽返渝，十六日夜曾接何應欽氏電話，囑其勸吳鐵誠氏就任政院副院長。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕報載章士剑氏將參加何內閣，出任司法行政部長一職，茲據有關方面告記者稱：「日前何院長在滬時，曾面邀章氏入閣，前（十六）晚何院長復以長途電話與章氏通話，請出任司法行政部長，章氏皆婉言辭謝，僅允不居名義，從旁協助，報載章氏已允入閣說，并非事實」。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨定今日召開中常會，商討何院長應欽邀請入閣問題。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕一部份立委劉錫五等十八人，頃聯名致函政院何院長，對新閣閣員人選，鄭重提出四項標準，以期選賢任能，無負民望。原函云：「此次先生出膺閣揆，值非常之時，當艱難之任，匡濟義高，至堪欽佩。方今國是在於促成和平，革新政治；而欲達此任務，惟在得人。茍人事不臧，則一切施政徒託空言，以先生之卓識，諒已知之稔，而籌之熟矣，同人旣同意先生組閣，尤望先生選賢任能，無負民望；爰就管見所及，擬其閣員人選標準，隨函奉塵，幸垂察焉。附閣員人選標準：（一）慎選廉能前進有為人員，不使貪污無能及投機份子入閣。（二）慎選堪任艱鉅努力職守人員，不可崇拜偶像，强拉衰庸及腐敗官僚入閣。（三）慎選一秉大公，為國為民服務之人員，不可引用專為派系利益或附益豪富份子入閣。（四）凡久任閣員或居軍政顯要素無成績表現者及因供職軍政致發大財者，均不應入閣」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕監院全體委員定十八日下午三時在國際聯歡社舉行茶會招待何應欽院長，對何內閣之施政方針及用人等問題將提供意見。十七日下午三時監院政治檢討研究小組舉行會議，各委員會就如何向何院長建議一點，先行交換意見，決定十八日向何建議時，應包括下列各點：（一）加强改革決心，（二）加强團結及進步，（三）用人惟賢，（四）樹立法治，嚴懲貪污，（五）整肅網紀，（六）慎重決策。十八日上午監院舉行政治檢討會時，并將在大會中再行交換意見。</p>

<p>〔合眾社南京十七日電〕消息靈通方面稱：某官方現正在研究中共實施北平局部和平十三條文，認為中共實際上完全破壞一月前所簽訂之北平和平協議。此等官方現正密切注意中共之每日廣播，等待毛澤東之允許開始和談，但對前途日益焦慮。某官方人士稱：北平協議之執行情形，如被認為係中共對未來解決態度之作風，則中國永久和平之希望，似極為渺茫。渠指出中共對北平協議最顯著之破壞，為禁止金圓劵流通及停止若干報紙出版，此舉「顯然不符協議之十三條文」</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕立院第三會期第六次會議，定十八日晨九時舉行，討論事項中共列四案，（一）咨請總統依法宣告動員戡亂時期之終止，即日停止動員戡亂時期臨時條款之適用案。（二）全國公教人員待遇應迅予合理調整案。（三）舉辦金價存款，穩定金融，改善薪餉辦法，保障儲蓄，團結軍民人心案。（四）請政府速定整軍計劃，減少軍額，緊縮開支，核實發餉，并將非戰鬥人員盡量裁減，節省國帑案。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕李代總統及何院長積極推行軍事革新聲中，立委王廣慶等四十六人，頃提出議案，請政府速定整軍計劃，減少軍額，緊縮開支，核實發餉，并將非戰鬥人員盡量裁減，節省國帑，已列入十八日院會議程。該案辦法為請政院迅速召集整軍會議，制定整編計劃，裁減軍隊，核實發餉，務使官兵收入足資維持生活，官兵員額暫以二百五十萬為限，其他非戰鬥人員及不必要之一切浮濫開支，亦宜盡量縮減。提案之理由中，曾列舉當前國軍之開支，內稱：查現有國軍據稱尚有官兵四百廿萬人，除台灣十五萬人薪餉另計外，其開支情形按本年三月份計算，數目如下：（一）薪餉銀元一千九百廿七萬二千四百七十六元，按三月初銀元高價，金圓劵三千三百計，折合金圓劵六百三十五億九千九百十七萬零八百元。（二）副秼費銀元五百萬元，折合金圓劵一百六十五億元，（三）公雜費銀元二百七十八萬一千元，折合金圓劵九十一億七千七百三十萬元。（四）事業費約合金圓劵九十五億元。（五）其他緊急用項約合金圓劵六十一億元。按此數目推算，每年官兵薪餉即須一萬二千五百八十五億一千七百六十四萬九千六百元，將來物價不斷踴躍，其數目更不知增加若干倍。此外，尚有服裝，軍火，飛機油料，軍糯諸大宗用項，每日聞將近二千億元，每年又須二萬億元左右，物價再漲，其激增情形，亦可類推。值此民力凋蔽，稅源枯竭，國庫收入銳減之際，如不確定整軍計劃，從事縮減，則帑藏日以空虛，勢必經濟破產，況官兵人數太多，待遇提高不易，生活不安，紀律蕩然，軍譽日險，徒衍國帑，現在本院主張簡化機構，厲行緊縮政策，對於國軍此項最大開支，首宜提議縮減，且查軍事機構組織龐大，是掌握物資者恣為侵牟，非戰鬥人員又將軍費耗去大部，前方將士不得一飽，軍心渙散，士氣不振，人民以血汗養兵，兵多反以病民，官多又以病民，咨嗟怨恨，戰鬥力失，整軍之計，豈容稍緩。</p>

<h3 id="c10">空軍炸沉黃安艦　重慶號仍停泊渤海海面 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>〔本報青島十七日電〕二月十二日潛逃之黃安軍艦，茲據確息：該艦業被青島空軍炸沉於連雲港口內。據悉：該艦係日本賠償我國的八艦之一，約三千噸，武器尚未裝備齊全，曾編入海軍第一艦隊服役。係於二月十二日晚停泊青島大港六號碼頭，是夜乘其艦長宿於岸上私寓，為其部屬潛開逃投共軍，共黨電台曾以之作為宣傳資料。</p>
<p>〔本報青島十七日電〕黃安軍艦潛逃失踪後，此間海軍第二軍區司令部接獲各種來源之情報，報告該艦行蹤，海軍基地派太平（艦長蔣謙）·固安（艦長安國强）兩艦出海搜索，當時因故未有空軍協助，旋經陸上情報與空軍偵察所得結果，證實該艦已駛抵連雲港口內，艦上人員則已登陸，集居於市內前鹽務局，當局經詳細研究後，卽決派空軍由海基派員隨同觀察，予以轟炸，該艦因係日本接收艦，尚未加裝備毫無抵抗，該艦於十五日中午最後一次轟炸中，完全中彈下沉，自十三日至十五日三日間，空軍每日出動一次或多次，每次在五架以上，記者今晚自此間海軍負責方面完全證實此事。唯該負責人因其他原因，僅發表該艦命中下沉之日期及地點兩事，并拒絕透露該艦確實人數及名單。又黃安艦炸沉後，曾有一趣味性之誤會，某方報稱，黃安號并未潛逃，仍在膠州灣，刻正舶竹岔島裝運軍品中，獲悉之下，頗感驚詫，旋即查明為同名之商船黃安輪，而非黃安艦。由於情報不確所引起之插曲頗多，此亦為其一。</p>
<p>〔本報青島十七日電〕據確悉：重慶號軍艦迄仍在渤海海面，此間空軍曾出發轟炸多次，該艦以猛烈高射砲火抵抗。另一最可靠消息稱：該艦并未至大連，此間空軍飛臨渤海海面，即可遭遇由旅大起飛之蘇聯機羣，相信旅大有極佳之雷達設備，重慶號可在渤海內多處港口補給。</p>

<p>〔本報鎮江十七日電〕記者應儀徵縣長左治人之邀，專輪赴該城一行，十七日返鎮。記者於居此江北孤城中廿四小時內所見所聞，軍事局面之緊張所給予該地政府及軍民間痛苦，遠不若生活上所遭遇之困難為大。該城六七華里以外，即為共軍出沒之所，入夜槍聲幾已成日常生活中之通常點綴。記者十七日晨赴城北據點　蜡廟附近參觀陣地時，於上午七時許即可遙見共軍之活動，自軍事當局決定封鎖江南北岸之交通後，該城日用品顯已大感缺乏，一般物價較鎮江高出數倍，復因控制區過少，軍糧民食亦大成問題。目前該縣保安團隊之糧秣，除向省方呼籲補助外，僅有出城覓奪共軍之公糧，以維持日食兩餐之不輟。</p>

<h3 id="c20">社論　對於和談的準備 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>—對何院長希望之四—</p>
<p>上海和平代表自北平歸來之日，和平空氣一時甚濃；所謂「困難雖多，希望甚大」頗動朝野的聽聞。甚至和談日期當在本月中旬以後，和談地點或在北平的傳說，也彷彿描繪了一幅中共願意和談的圖畫。</p>
<p>但證以此一週來的消息，如共軍在江北集結兵力三十萬人以上，如最近林彪所部十餘萬人已南下抵徐，如江北沿岸的橋頭堡已受威脋，共軍渡江部署幾已完成，如中共廣播詆毀李代總統與何院長依然在串演「假和平」等等，似又無一不與上海代表歸來所傳述者相反。「山雨欲來風滿樓」，就江南地區而言，目前實已到了山雨欲來的前夜，朝野上下應該不能再高枕無憂了吧！</p>
<p>適於此時，政府內部掀起了政潮，孫閣之倒不足論，而新閣又以部會之削減，派系之牽制，遲遲未能組成，更未暇計及如何和談之大計，此真如大火早已燎原，而吾人猶待修理消防機器，徵調消防人員，其危險不難想像。何院長在中共大兵壓境之下，奉李代總統之命，準備和談？</p>
<p>關於和談，姑不論其前途之成敗如何，而在目前政府所不能不亟亟準備者，至少有兩點：</p>
<p>（一）和談的力量　或者以為旣要和談，就不必再顧到力量。殊不知沒有可以和談的力量，就不必侈言和談，只說投降可耳。因為和談之一方，如果已經自問無力，或雖有力而不自信其有力，亦不能善用其力，則所謂和談者，舍唯唯聽命外，豈有他途？或者又以為倘有力量，就不妨一戰而何必言和。此又是大誤。固然，惟能戰，才能和；故和談的力量應該就是戰爭的力量。不過同此力量，不用之於求戰而用之於求和，這就成為和談的力量了。故用此「能戰」的力量以求和，則和談庶幾乎可成；若并此僅存的「能戰」的力量而削弱之，或根本不問此「能戰」的力量尚有若干，以為此均足以妨碍和談，日惟「先意承旨」取悅共黨以為快，我們敢說和談必無成功之望，而投降結果則政府蒙其辱，人民受其困而已。</p>
<p>何院長革命數十年，以有功國家的名將，受艱鉅之任，其最大的課題就在整頓此能戰能和的力量以誠意求和。然則此力量在那裏呢？孟子嘗謂：天時不如地利，地利不如人和。長江天塹，介乎兩軍之間，政府果能使海空軍與陸軍密切配合，不能不說得地利。今天的問題，力量就在於「人和」程度之如何。假使將與將不和，或兵與官不和，或官與軍不和，或兵與兵不和，或軍與民不和，或民與官不如，或民與民不和，或有其一，有其二三，乃至盡有之而不免，則力量之所存者幾何？故欲增加和談的力量，必須充實戰備的力量，此似相反而實相成。</p>
<p>因此之故，何內閣成立後之任務，首在統一中樞與地方當局之意志，消減軍隊派系之鴻溝，其次務須改善軍人之待遇，尤須使將領與士卒共生活，同甘苦。復次，必須不顧一切以整肅軍隊之風紀，使人民樂與士兵相親近，而舉凡軍隊之腐敗習氣，更當一掃而空。最後，今日以前的苛政繁法，應以壯士斷腕的決心，一概廢止，藉示與民更始，而後已失之民心可以重得。只有在內外一致，軍民一體，上下一心的情況下，我們才可以振人心，作士氣，才可以有真正和談的力量。否則自欺欺人的結果，將使無一地不為北平天津之續！</p>
<p>（二）和談的方法。　吾人要希望和談成功，應使在和談的過程中，有人民代表能任調停排解之職責。過去政協之失敗，三人小組會議之所以無成，就壞在雙方沒有把人民放在眼中，一切一切均由雙方代表秘密商談，雖有馬歇爾將軍參與其間，究非國人，痛癢較淺，成就自難。現在懲前毖後，政府應主張由人民代表參加和談，而和談其間的經過，無論條件的提出或磋商，彼此代表的研討與辨難，均應逐日公開，以示天下為公之至意，接受全國人民的隨時批判，庶幾可以減少許多不合情理的無謂爭執，即有爭執亦不難折服於公理正義之下，而收到相忍相讓的善果。</p>
<p>再則和談進行之際，政府必須有進退自如的綢繆，而萬不可實逼處此，不顧一切以訂城下之盟。因為旣云和談，自不免於往返磋商，至再至三，其中情勢變化，誰能預測？假使狃於「和平誠意」之說，以為共軍不妨進薄瓜州采石沿江陣地，而吾政府必始終留在共軍砲火威脋之地，方足以談和，其誤國禍民，終將噬臍無及。須知和談乃和平代表之事，有所請求，儘可電報往返，而不必政府留置於前綫。若謂恐和談無成而再戰，政府不應移其重心，則尤非至當之論。因為果一且而復戰，則前敵指揮乃將帥之事，而非中樞當局之職。昔王夫之論宋徽宗，嘗謂「徽宗南奔以避寇，勢迫而不容弗避；避之尚未足以亡也。以勢言之，頭不剸者命不傾。以理言之，……諸侯棄其國而無國，天子棄都城而固有天下，未喪其世守也，故未大失也。……惟李綱昧此，惜此四面受敵之孤城，仍此議論猥繁之朝廷，率此姦邪怙黨之僉壬，殉此瞻戀穠華之婦稚，虜兵乍退，歌舞仍前。……卒使兩君俘，六宮虜，金帛括盡，凍餓空城，曾不得逸出以謀生，而上下交絕其大命。」我們讀了這段議論，深深覺得李代總統與何院長，應該對和談之際中央政府的所在地問題，迅作妥善的考慮，勿再猶豫徘徊而自貽不測之禍，使後之視今，亦猶今之視昔！</p>
<h3 id="c21">台灣向民生主義之途邁進　改革土地努力生產　陳誠在京暢談主台後設施 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕台灣將在陳誠主席之主政下，以「推行三民主義，實行土地改革，努力生產，以達成民生主義之目的」。此為陳誠主席於十六日午夜在首都飯店旅寓接見本報記者時所談。陳氏稱：吾人欲以此為試驗解決民生問題是不是不流血也可達成？陳氏繼稱：在台省行政會議中，且已決定地主減租千分之三七五辦法，同時獲得全省人士之擁護，此點可作為土地改革之初步實現。陳氏并稱：吾人作此試驗，可使一般人有所評價，究竟實現三民主義與實施其他政策何者為好？陳氏此語實具有以台省為實現三民主義之模範區之決心。陳氏對台省一般情況之說明，認為當前係財政·經濟·金融能求得步調一致，頗可滿意，惟自外省人士前往後，食糧略感缺乏，故目前正自限制入境及糧食增產兩點做起；其次，為住的問題，亦待解決。陳氏旋稱：此次台省行政會議，可謂為全民政治之表現，行政長官及議長均參加，且均能自由發表意見，故收穫至佳，陳氏對此甚表滿意。末記者詢以有關張學良之釋放問題，陳氏稱：此非地方官之事。</p>
<h3 id="c22">美經合署續援華　新議案中規定直至本年底為止　尚餘八千萬美元未動用 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十六日電〕據經合總署援華官員稱：目下在美國參院中之經濟援華議案，將使經合總署能繼續援助，直至本年六月底左右。</p>
<p>此一議案於星期二由眾院外交委員會主席季約翰在眾院內所提出。當時經合中國分署賴樸翰與經合援華計劃組主任史利扶蘭曾稱：該議案為一種行動議案。</p>
<p>賴樸翰與克利扶蘭指此一議案之特點，為補充一九四八年之援華法案，該法案規定自一九四八年四月三日開始對華經濟援助一年。此項補充案將繼續國會經濟援華之權限，直至一九四九年十二月卅一日。但上述兩官員稱：在此種權限之下，所有可以動用之基金，僅能繼續援華三個月之久。</p>
<p>按去年國會撥款二億七千五百萬美元，實行經濟援華，其中約有八千萬美元尚未動用。但經合總署預料在現行法案於四月二日半夜滿期以前，在未經動用之援華基金中尚須提出二千二百萬美元，以供購買復興物資新核準案之需。</p>
<p>因而在建議中之援華法案延長案之下，尚有五千八百萬美元餘款可用以繼續對華帮助。據克賴二氏稱：在目前之消耗率上，該款將在六月底用罄。克里扶蘭稱：經合署不擬在補充案內所規定之全部時期中使用此項少數撥款。按補充法案規定援華延長至一九四九年底為止。</p>
<p>賴樸翰等答覆問題時稱：經合署對新法案所觸及之問題及所延長之時期感到滿意。克里扶蘭及賴樸翰稱：經合總署并未考慮建議新經濟援華計劃，亦不負責提出任何建議。克里扶蘭稱：繼續援華與否，將由國務院·總統·及國會決定。據稱：今後數週內，華南復興用款將改作購買食米棉麥及實施中國農村復興計劃。有人指出國會雖撥款二億七千五百萬美元以實施中國經濟復興計劃，但核準此項計劃之撥發之款額，最高可至三億三千八百萬美元。賴樸翰及克里扶蘭稱：經合署并不要求季約翰法案所撥發額之六千三百萬美元，該項法案之要點，乃在延長有效時期，俾能使用原有二億七千五百萬援款中之餘額。</p>
<p>茍國會於一九四九年四月三日通過季約翰法案，參眾兩院仍須通過新撥款法案，俾使原有二億七千五百萬美元中尚未用罄之餘款，仍能於四月二日後繼續作援華之用。季約翰法案規定在國會未通過此項撥款法案前，建設銀公司可墊付經合總署五千萬元，以作援華之用。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕美國前駐華軍事顧問團長巴大維撤退歸國，今日與記者談國共戰事勝負關鍵，謂中國政府軍之敗，其重大癥結在於軍心渙散，并無一次戰敗可歸咎於兵器軍火之不足。另一重大原因則在於缺乏將才及軍中之貪污腐化。中國政府軍可謂澈上澈下抱着失敗主義，尤以士兵俸給低微，糧秣惡劣，以致更無鬥志。共軍所用兵器一大部份係自國軍方面奪得之美式配備，余絕未見共軍中有何蘇聯配備。共軍方面有蘇聯軍官之說，亦僅見之於傳聞，并無實據。美國軍事援助一億二千五百萬元物資，在國軍崩潰前達到前綫者有限，大部份現由中國政府保存於台灣。即在現在，共軍方面所有飛機不過寥寥數架。國軍方面則最多時有美國戰時所造B—24型及B—25型轟炸機及B—51型戰鬥機約四百六十架，其中二百七十五架可以作戰。巴氏稱：中國政府軍中有貪污情事，余雖無正式報告，但見軍官俸給低微，出入必以華貴汽車，此不能不令人起疑。巴氏估計中國政府軍員額共三四百萬，其中空軍十萬，海軍五萬，巴氏并稱：蔣介石氏之引退，雖已擺脫總統之職，但蔣氏在國內仍有其極大之擁護者。美國軍事顧問團對於中國政府軍適將大有貢獻之際，乃情勢劇變，不得不撤退。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕共產黨控制下之華北經濟，刻正陷於嚴重危機，而迄未獲得解決，連日中共電台廣播新聞中，有若干消息即為反映人民生活之疾苦情形者。目前共產黨對於都市之經濟，仍任其保留舊時代之原來面目。此非中共承認華北經濟形態為合理之發展，而事實乃一時無法澈底執行其預定政策。依據中共電台之廣播而觀，華北經濟之嚴重現象，一為物價問題，另一為工人之工資無法養家活口，紛向共黨當局提出要求。對於前者，中共之對策為積極增加生產，以圖解決此一危機。人民銀行已決定舉辦生產貸款，扶植有益於國計民生的鋼鐵，紡織，交通，公用等民營及國營企業。關於後者，由於工人所得之工資不足以解決其生活，無法達到共黨所倡導之階級利益，獲得切實保障，漸漸趨於怨懣，故已改采「實物工資制」辦法，以事補救。此項「實物工資制」辦法　，原本行於東北，刻亦推及華北，其辦法係由合作社供應職工工資中百分之七十的實物，使其可以不受物價波動的影響。昨日中共電台廣播之天津消息，曾公開承認震中橡膠廠，北洋火柴廠勞資間發生工資問題，震中橡膠廠工人方面表示工資太低，故影響工人生產情緒，經過中共指導下之華北區工會籌委會天津辦事處調解後，業已將工資予以提高。北洋火柴廠為工資過高，影響資方擴大再生產，經該處苦心調解，減低工資，但責成資方切實改進安全設備，負担因工受傷者醫藥費用，以期提高工人生活待遇，進而達到增加生產量，解決物資缺乏及恐慌現象。又據可靠方面消息，東北及華北工人自受共產黨控制後，其工作時間多已由八小時加至十小時，并以「勞動英雄」及「按件計算工資」等方法，獎勵工人中之勤勞者。最近中共電台廣播新聞中，十之三四，均為此類消息，即此一端，亦已足以反映共黨處境之困難。</p>
<p>現中共為欲提高生產，正以迎接解放後的第一個五一勞動節為題，發動「生產大競賽」，鼓勵工人大家都做勞動英雄，提高工作效率，增加生產數量，協助共黨「解放工作」。</p>

<p>〔中央社馬尼剌十六日電〕菲參院過去三週間，因相對兩派在選舉中爭取領導地位，事實上雖休會三星期，今起復又集會矣。首一議案，即為外人獲得地產均被認為破壞菲憲法，當通過一處置法案。此間華僑權威人士認為此案甚影響華僑在菲利益，因該案規定，凡一九三六年後憲法生效時起，外人所購買之土地，必須依法將其轉讓與合法管轄該土地之人士，若在規定期內不自動依法轉讓，則菲政府將代表業主拍賣之。該案刻已交付眾院徵求同意中，又，此舉勢亦將影響此間英·法·西各國僑民，因彼等亦管有巨量地產，惟此案將不致影響美僑，因根據貝爾貿易法案，美僑與菲人同享公民權利也。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十七日廣播：艾契遜與冰島外長貝尼狄森之談判已告順利結束，當即發表聯合公報。艾氏强調北大西洋公約之目的，純為維護世界和平，且係根據聯合國憲章而草訂者。貝氏則力言冰島因無軍隊，情形與眾不同，并稱，冰島決不同意在和平時期由任何國家之軍隊利用冰島之基地。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕大西洋公約之八創立國，即美英法荷比盧挪及加拿大，已於今日聯名柬邀丹麥·冰島·義大利·葡萄牙四國，於四月四日以創立國之身份在華盛頓參加大西洋公約之正式簽字儀式。請柬中專請四國外長於四月第一週內來華盛頓參加簽字儀式，與請柬同時發出者為大西洋公約之草案，其內容將於明日在各參加國首都同時公布。此次八國柬邀丹麥等四國同為大西洋公約之創立國，未將愛爾蘭包括在內，係因愛爾蘭政府對前此之非正式邀請，未作明確答覆之故。愛爾蘭於兩週前曾聲明，在南北愛爾蘭未曾統一以前，愛爾蘭尚無意參加大西洋公約。此間外交界人士預料，義葡丹冰四國接受邀請之答覆，可於週末以前遞達華盛頓。葡國立場已於在里斯本及華盛頓舉行之談判中，作明確之表示。義大利及冰島亦均已在非正式接觸中，表明願意參加公約之意志。丹麥由於格陵蘭基地問題，曾要求保證在除非緊急情形以外，格陵蘭之基地不能被借用。義大利在其政府本身方面對於參加大西洋公約并無問題，而在國會中，共黨及左翼社會黨雖表示反對，但以政府黨在國會中握有多數，故反對黨亦將莫能為力。</p>

<p>〔路透社羅馬十七日電〕義共黨今晨在眾院中，以暴擊場面，力圖阻義參加大西洋公約。該約在眾院中之辯論自昨日下午起，至今午尚在繼續中。議長不耐，曾兩度退出會場，但共黨議員堅持行使其發言權，根據憲法每一議員至少得發言五分黨，而一百餘名議員均要求逐一發言，故料在得以表決以前，辯論或當賡續至深夜甚至明晨。加斯貝利總理竟夜列席眾院參與辯論，成為共黨議員攻擊的主要對象，有斥為說謊者·笨夫，并囑其滾出議場者，加氏三次欲起立發言，均為共黨議員齊歌共產國際之聲所阻止。在辯論最激烈之際，共黨與基督民主黨至拔拳互毆，歷廿分鐘始已。當加斯貝利最後得以起立發言，强調義國蒙受馬歇爾議案之利益，務必參加大西洋公約時，一共黨議員高呼「不再向華爾街屈服」「打倒美帝國主義」。議長以不堪維持秩序，曾退席十五分鐘。政府為恐表決以後，共黨可能發動暴動，故已采取嚴密戒備措施。共黨控制之義全國總工會已聲明於國會批準參加大西洋公約之後，立即發動全國性罷工。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕英國務大臣麥克尼爾今日告下院稱，保羅匈三國在蘇聯支援下，阻止英美之設立監督機構，以保證和約條款之執行。羅保兩國均已破壞和約之軍事條款，而匈牙利亦計劃不願和約限制，擴充其軍力。三國對於和約中關於保障人權及經濟部份之條款，亦均加以破壞。自和約簽訂至本月十五日為止之十八個月內，和約規定於發生執行和約條款之任何爭講時，應由英美蘇駐在該國首都之外交團首長共同行動。一九四七年底英美決定要求羅匈保三國根據和約條款，將其本國軍隊狀況告知，然三國政府均以須由英美蘇三國共同行動為藉口，拒絕英美之要求。英政府因此不得不認此等前敵國政府勾同蘇政府，避不履行和約條款。</p>

<h3 id="c104">北平型（六） <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>關於「局部和平」前後的一個城市的報道</p>
<p>（六）軍隊改編問題</p>
<p>原來駐在北平城內的國軍，共有八個軍，二十五個師，除了一〇四軍還在城內協助担任警備工作，其餘都移駐城外了。依照協議的規定，在一個月要改編為人民解放軍，當然這是一個重大的問題！在這軍事第一的情勢下，軍隊的力量空間是値得人重視的！如果這二十幾萬人一天不改編，中共至少也得在北平附近擺上二十幾萬人監視着，以免發生意外。本來平津戰事結束以後，林彪的部隊便可向南抽調，以救陳毅在江北的損失，並加強渡江的力量。可是因為北平附近的國軍還沒有改編，便無法達成這個任務。所以中共對於這個軍隊改編工作，是非常重視而正在積極進行的。</p>
<p>照原來的協商，是原編制，原人事加以整編，並不是改編。但是現在情勢的發展，中共是否依照協議整編，或大加改革的改編，尚不可知。這一部份國軍的士氣很旺盛，很有意要和中共拼一拼；再加以此次局部和平中，許多侮辱的現象，給他門以莫大的精神刺激，內心憤怒之火，是更熾烈的在燃燒着！如果不依照原議整編，也許可能爆發這座火山。</p>
<p>在筆者離開北平之前，各種謠言是在秘密的廣泛的傳佈着：如陳毅部隊在江北吃了兩次敗仗，損失在四五十萬人以上。馬步芳因不滿傅作義投降的舉動，已經從西北出兵來攻，馬的騎兵已經到了承德一帶。岡村寗次回國以後，日本已經出兵，向秦皇島一帶登陸，北平到山海關的火車已經不通了。……種種沒有事實根據的謠言，普遍的流傳於北平城郊的國軍部隊中，更增強了他們奮鬥的士氣。這並不是說這些謠言可靠，而是說明了他們仍舊在懷念着中央，希望能有一個機會使他們報國。北平城郊的國軍，所積存糧秣，大約尚可供三個月的補給，武器彈藥也相當充足，如果中共應付得不好，可能還是一個發生問題的漏洞。</p>
<p>中共也知道這些謠言的流傳，他們認為這是軍統和中統潛伏在平津的份子散佈出來的。因此北平警備司令部曾嚴令散在民間的憲兵十九團官兵，一律要趕快報到，呈繳武器，否則便要加以懲辦。同時，中共對於軍隊改編工作，也是一面嚴密注意的在運用各個擊破的政策，分散力量，順利解決。一面則由李濟琛運用各種手段及私人關係，與各部隊長用感情聯繫，免生異動。如前六十二軍軍長兼天津防守副司令林偉儔，本來已在天津被俘，現在經李濟琛向中共保證，恢復了自由准其在北平市內自由行動，但不能離開北平。又據筆者此次在途中所聽到的消息，九十二軍軍長黃翔，因愛好跳舞被中共認為不求進步的分子，予以免職扣押，並查封他所置的房產，有的部隊則在分別調動隔離，務使力量分散，無法協同一致，於是予取予奪，各個擊破。可見中共的用計良深！</p>
<p>（七）局面愈來愈緊</p>
<p>政治是具有排他性，控制性的東西。中共治下的政治，尤是控制得很嚴！中共的黨員和幹部，都是特務工作人員。隨時都在監視你，沒有放鬆過。中共是一種組織體，只有黨的決議和集團的意志，沒有私人的情感和關係。有人以為我和中共某人的私交很好，也許他可以看在私人的情面上買買賬。有人以為我沒有罵過中共，他或可以對我表示一些好感，不致與我為難。其實這都是錯誤的觀念，根本不了解中共的本質！他們的一切態度都是根據黨的利害來決定的。譬如在蔣總統在未引退以前，中共極力攻擊蔣，大家以為只要蔣引退，中共便不會再行攻擊了。結果李宗仁代理總統，便將攻擊目標轉移到李身上了。張治中和邵力子是和中共辦交道最多的人，大家目為和平使者，而中共攻擊張邵也是一樣的，不會例外。不了解中共的本質，而決定對中共的辦法，必然會發生很大的偏差和錯誤的。</p>
<p>在北平剛剛實現局部和平的時候，大家因對現實政治太不滿意了，便將希望寄託於中共的統治，以為中共在北平將組織聯合政府，一切政治措施必不同於其他各地的情形，也許大家都可以插足其間。居住北平抱着這種想法的人頗不少。同時，中共初初進城，一切情况茫無頭緒，接收工作也非常迫切地等着去處理，暫時無法顧到政治上的許多問題，名方面都表現一種寬大的作風，藉以收攏人心。可是接收工作慢慢上軌道，情况也了解得比較多一些，於是政治的控制便漸漸加強，局面愈來愈緊，始終是脫不了他們原來的那一套。</p>
<p>慶祝北平解放的大會上，北平市長葉劍英的講話中，最後提到為加強北平軍事管制的任務，將逮捕必須逮捕的戰犯，和反動派的首要份子，這與原來協議中保障公敎人員生命安全一點，顯然是發生抵觸。因為領導與他們作戰的重要「戰犯」傅作義，尚可將功贖罪，難道還有必須逮捕的戰犯嗎？！我聽了葉劍英這一段話後，知道這裏面必有文章，鬥爭，淸算的事實是慢慢地要在各種外貌下，巧妙地實施了。</p>
<p>果不出所料，人民日報以很大的篇幅，刋載了七五事件死亡學生家屬的控訴，高喊着血債要用血來還，請求政府懲辦七五事件的罪魁許惠東。這一段陪襯的前奏曲演過後，過不了幾天，許惠東便被逮捕拘禁起來了。這一篇文章將來是怎樣結局？現在還不知道，當然也不用着去預測了。</p>
<p>接着便是張蔭梧以匪首的罪名被捕了。人民日報將這段新聞是作頭條刋載的；標題是「北平破獲大軍事特務案，匪首張逆蔭梧等落網」。還附刋了好幾張照片，情勢非常嚴重！</p>
<p>筆者因與張蔭梧私交頗好，對於這個案情知道得比較詳細，實在是太冤枉了！去年北平各中學在華北剿總的領導下，設立了冬令營。四存中學也請求設立為冬令營的一個大隊，向剿總請領了一些破舊的槍枝，作為訓練之用。槍枝是這樣來的，至於那部無綫電是一部日本式軍用電台，僅能通二三十里路之遠，根本沒有用過，去年夏間保定四存中這因負債甚多，張曾託我設法轉賣給二〇八師，以便償債，後來因索價太高，沒有賣成。但是這些槍枝和電台便成了張蔭梧反動的鐵證，豈不冤枉嗎！</p>
<p>中共為什麼要逮捕張蔭梧呢？主要的是過去抗日時期，張任河北省民軍總司令，在敵後游擊，沒有與中共合作，而且有過衝突的事實。因之中共非常懷恨他。張是一個廉潔而公正的人，在北平市河北省的聲望很好，頗有一種號召力量。同時各縣的地方武力，也有些人想把他擁起出來的。中共是素來不容許不與他們合作而有辦法的人存在的。張自己旣有一部分潛勢力，又與東北佟壽山馬希援等來往，所以，他們不得不加以逮捕，而用一座特務案的大帽子壓在頭上，使他動彈不得。</p>
<p>總之，共黨的政治本質是一種強力的控制，無論是用那一種的外貌，都脫不出這個本質。中共統治下的北平政治，當然只有日益加強其控制力量，局面日益嚴重的了！只注意現象，忽略問題的本質，是會使你發生錯覺，而對現實處理錯誤。</p>
<p>（八）離開北平，經過解放區</p>
<p>筆者因看到北平的局勢愈來愈緊，不是久居之所。便決定不顧一切旅途的艱險，卽日離開北平。同時也想經過解放區，親身去看看他們的統治情形。</p>
<p>二月十八日的早晨由北平開始登上旅途，火車票是先一天已經買好了，從北平坐火車到天津，票價人民票九十六元。沿途未經檢查盤問，平津鐵路雖已通車多日了，可是車上的秩序非常混亂！後來因改變了漫無限制的購票現象，前一天起才稍微好了一些，不過許多人還是沒有坐位。只有三等車，沒有頭二等，這是平等的表示。車行的時間不甚凖確，沿途等了兩次車，每次都在一小時以上，本來應該下午二時到津，結果弄到當日下午四時後才到達天津，也沒有檢查。</p>
<p>十九日便由天津改乘汽車往濟南，票價一千五百元人民票。離開天津的時候，要經過一道檢查手續，只要沒有特別的情節，經過檢查人員的抽查和訓話後，便准其上車放行。沿途經過村莊，也有二三處地方要停車檢查，並不十分嚴格，多數都是根據中共的寬大政策，予以放行。只要有了通行證，還可以少說許多話。北平當時因未發通行證，筆者無通行證，僅有一紙南京市的國民身份證，盤問起來便要多說幾句話。我們所乘的車子，因開出天津便出了毛病，只好等着另外換一部車子才繼續前進，當天宿在邑縣。第二天早上五時餘便起床，想趁早而行，當日能到達德州。但是經過滄縣附近的橋旁，有一度嚴密的檢查。筆者因無通行證，而身份證上塗改了幾個字，與我的私章不合，於是便遭扣留了，不准繼續前途。經過交涉，將車票退還了一千元人民票，筆者便和另一位同車者，被解送到某地去了，這兒是一個公安局的分駐所，同來的那位朋友，一經詢問之後便釋回去了，而我則拘留在這兒，不讓回去。</p>
<h3 id="c105">台糧恐慌的陰影 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員吳守仁</p>
<p>〔本報台北十一日航訊〕從二月初開始，台灣遭遇了有史以來空前的災難；一向祗籠罩在外省人心頭的白色恐怖的陰影，接踵了　擁而來的高等難民羣，猛襲着這孤懸的海島！我們翻開二月份的報紙，一日紅盤蓬萊白米每百台斤做開台幣壹拾陸萬元，當時匯率是一比六十五元，折合金圓應該是貳仟肆百陸拾元強，再加上二成重量上的差額，那就是說：等於上海一市担的白米，在台灣要賣金圓貳仟玖百伍拾貳元。而回頭看看上海的紅盤做開金圓肆仟三百元，以上兩個數字吿訴我們，台灣的米價要比上海便宜三分之一；這一個比例，在近百年以來，從未給任何力量破壞過。因為台灣非但是一個產米區，並且是一個過剩區，它在糧食供求的統計上，始終保持着大量出超的豐足！卽使拿糧食生產銳减最烈的卅四年來說，它雖然從一·〇六八·一二一噸的產量慘跌到六三八·八二八噸，但除了損失一筆出超的收入之外，對省內的供求問題，仍舊沒有遭遇到什麼困難；對上海糧價的比例，也依然保持着傳統的紀錄。</p>
<p>曾幾何時，台灣維持了近百年傳統的驕傲，已完全給現實摧毁！我們看二月五日的台·滬兩地米市：</p>
<p>台灣蓬萊白米</p>
<p>每百台斤售台幣二十萬元，照那天一比三五的匯率，再加二成重量差額，應該折成金圓七千一百三十元一市担，而同天上海的行情，黑市是七千元，政府拋售價是四千五百元；報紙上已經刋出「吳市長赫然震怒，聲聞室外」的新聞了。從這一天起，台滬米價非惟拉平，甚且後來居上，台灣取得了領導權，極迅速地爬上了全國最貴地區的高峯！我們還記得那是二月廿二日，每百台斤售台幣三十三萬元，匯率是一比十六，加了差重，每市担要折合金圓二萬四千七百四十四元；而上海門售白粳是一萬一千元至一萬二千元。在台灣買一担米，到上海可買二担多，較之廿天以前，上海買一担到台灣可買一担三斗的情形，相去何啻天壤之別？其漲勢之速及貴賤倒掛角度的轉變之烈，又豈是一般人所能想像？台灣一百一十六萬戶中有百分之五十二是本身不事糧食生產的人民，他們處於這開台灣有史以來空前創例的糧價狂飚中，猶如從天堂跌入地獄，憤慨和憂慮的情緒是難以言宣的。</p>
<p>記者不欲抹煞政府在這一個嚴重的事實中，所作的種種努力和措施；譬如擴大拋售區域，和戶口配售，特種配售等，政府正不惜以把握的實物作孤注一擲。同時又廣泛地運用了政治力量，普遍查擠大戶，糧商的存糧限期出售；我們不能不承認政府在抑平糧價的原則上，已然盡其所能。但是，看看效果，在記者執筆的一天（三月九日），台灣糧價雖然在數字上跌到每百台斤卅萬元，而折合市担的金圓價，照匯率一比九，還是要四萬元左右；比較同天上海的市價二萬九千五百元，仍然是貴了百分之四十強。我們無可諱言，目前的情形依舊是不合理的；至少限度必須恢復二月一日以前的比例，纔能算正常！這是全台灣人民一致的要求，也是省政當前重大的攷騐。</p>
<p>要使台灣的米價恢復正常，首先應該明瞭是什麼力量來破壞台灣維繫近百年，已成為傳統的米價比例的？記者曾經就此問題與許多專家分別討論；綜合多數的意見，大致可以歸納為四點：第一是因時局的急轉直下，內地如平·津·京·滬·一帶的人口，大量疏散到台灣來，以致造成消耗量的激增。第二是因人口和消耗量的增加，刺激把握糧食的大戶和糧商心理，不願出售存糧，以致影響市面上糧食流通的數量。第三是台幣本身的貶値。第四是因以上三點所引起的糧價波動，加了八一九限價失敗的前車之鑒，使沒有糧食的人民以及內地疏散來台的高等難民，對政府控制糧價的得喪失了信心，大家不約而同收購糧食存儲；以致供求問題在無形中超出預算，而發生不平衡的現象，更加促成米價愈漲愈烈的趨勢。我們從上述的四點中，可以得到一種結論，就是今日台灣米價之漲得出乎常軌，完全是近乎庸人自擾的人為因素所招致。何以見得呢？姑且看以上的四點，除第三點外，其餘的三點都應該以第一點為最初的原始出發點；沒有第一點也就不會有第二和第四點的現象。因此，記者可以針對這第一點，提供幾種數字來說明：我們首先需要明瞭的是目前台灣加上內地疏散而來的人口總和究竟是多少，根據最近同時也是最凖確的統計，現在台灣的人口總數是六，七九九，一九六人，依照最標準合理計算，每人每年需要糧食一四四公斤；這將近七百萬人口的每年總需要最就是九七九，〇八四，二二四公噸。而我們看今年糧食的收成，照最低的估計是一，〇六八·四二一公噸；那末生產量與消耗量相抵還有八九，三三六·七七六公噸的剩餘。以上的數字，記者敢肯定地說，沒有別種更凖確的統計了；也沒有一個人可以空言來推翻。因此，從這幾種數字中，我們可以知道最近半年來，大家雖然在直覺上感到內地的人口像海潮一樣　擁而來；但對於台灣糧食的供求，還不至於有失去平衡的影響！從而可以見得第一點所說「造成消耗量的激增」，在實際上幷不能發生什麼作用！至於說心理上的刺激，就科學的觀點而言，是根本站不住的；就政治的觀點而言，更不能承認它的存在。</p>
<p>現代經濟學上，有一種公認的學理：就是物價問題是整個的供求問題；糧價是物價中的一種，當然脫離不了這個範疇。而台灣的糧價却超乎這個範疇，它所憑藉的不過是虛渺的人為的心理刺激；這決不是凖確的理論根據。因此，針對這乖張的事實，政治力量是一種最好的考騐！記者認為在糧政當局目前所作的種種措施上，還應該有若干技術上的修正和補充：第一關於戶口配售和特種配售，依照原辦法前者是憑戶口證三人以上每五天配售十斤，三人以下每十天配售十斤，價格為市價的七折，後者是數量與前者相同，而價格提高為市價的九折。我們覺得這一種措施，在原則上果然是非常正確；但在數量價格方面，實在有改善的必要！在量的方面：多寡等級的劃分要加以縝密的計算，最好是以人為單位，幷且要使之獲得不必再購之市塲的充分用量。在價格方面，配價不能跟隨市價，而應該領導市價作有效合理的削减。第二是關於勒令大戶及糧商限期出售存糧，我們認為這一種限期應該改為分期分量出售，譬如政府限定某一大戶或某一糧商在半月內出售他的存糧，就必須就他存糧的多寡，給他規定每三天或每五天一定要出售多少，到半月為止一定要售完。則可以避免大戶和糧商在限期內的拖延，對抑平糧價的效果上也是一種帮助。</p>
<p>陳辭修先生於接長省政之始，不惜在萬機待理之時，把力量傾致在抑平鹽價上，進而頒佈了台灣省食鹽平價配銷方案，將鹽價一下子壓低百分之四十。這是為什麼？因為他瞭解食鹽在人類生活上所佔的重要性。而食米在人類生活史上當然更佔分量，現在米價的超越常軌，陳氏不能說不知道；惟其因為我們瞭解他的觀察力是無微不至的，相信他一定要以雷霆萬鈞之力來約束米價恢復正常。因此，記者在以往廿天內，米價漲勢最烈的時候，沒有從事這白色恐怖在台灣如何囂張跋扈的報導；大家都在以沉重的心情靜待着陳辭修先生的有效對策！然而，一個月過去了，米價雖略呈下跌的趨勢，但距離正常仍遠；我們認為這是一個最好的時機，政府應該乘此機會傾全力導使米價恢復二月一日前的比例；全省的人民都要求陳氏拿出抑平鹽價時的毅力來！因為，萬一米價再在人為的因素下餘鹽再燃，其勢是更不可收拾了。俗語說：「物必兒皇帝腐而後蟲生」，今日的米價問題，正是剛在開始自腐而生蟲的時候，假使政府不此之圖，等到腐爛擴大，蟲的力量培植完成，就未免要悔之晚矣。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　鄭志昂</p>
<p>〔本報香港十四日航訊〕在「解放區」內，一切軍人，資產階級以及知識份子，都有被淸算，被鬥爭的份子，這已經是任何人都認識得淸淸楚楚的事實。不僅如此就連所謂「同路人」也被無情地攻擊。最近，東北方面和香港方面，對於文藝作家蕭軍（一名田軍）又捲起一層淸算的狂潮各地文化人都很希望知道被淸算的內幕情形，因此記者願借本報通訊版的篇幅來給讀者一個翔實的報道。</p>
<p>先來說明蕭軍是怎樣的一個作家。他是左翼作家陣容中的所謂「東北作家」之一，他寫過許多的長短篇小說，其中以「八月的鄕村」為最著名。而他的出山，應該歸功於魯迅，因為在當時，「八月的鄕村」未曾受知於文壇，又無緣在出版界方面找一個出版的機會。蕭軍富於敏感，立刻謀之於魯迅，希望借他的吹噓，爭取出版家的靑睞，結果，魯迅答應了他，給他的「八月的鄕村」做了一篇捧塲的序文，並編入「奴隸　書」，以嶄新的姿態出現了，此書一出，文壇上也就隨和着大捧特捧，而蕭軍之成為名作家從此奠定而不可動搖了。</p>
<p>抗戰期間，蕭軍從上海疏散到重慶，又從重慶轉赴延安，去年到哈爾濱，出版了一種週刋，呌做「文化報」。在「八一五」慶祝東北日寇投降那一天出版的「文化報」，他懷着深刻的自覺，對蘇聯在東北的所作所為，看得比較別人更明晰，於是他拿着如椽的大手筆，旁敲側擊地說明了蘇聯是赤色帝國主義者。這一個呼聲大大的觸怒了東北解放區的當局，認為蕭軍旣已來到解放區，就應該不會說這種「怪話」，他旣然說了「怪話」，就是證明了他和「反蘇反共的國民黨反動派」一鼻孔出氣了，非敎訓他一頓不可，尤其非把他圍剿他一下不可，以為只有這樣做，才可以把蕭軍紏正過來，同時才可以對羣衆施以公開敎育的機會。他們的中心意思，不外乎一個公式化的理論，說：「我們知道，只有反蘇反共的國民黨反動派才欺騙的說帝國主義分『赤』『白』兩色，而誣稱蘇聯為『赤色帝國主義。」</p>
<p>這是同一個理論的另一方式的表現，他們異口同聲地說：「你蕭軍對於蘇聯紅軍為什麼不作任何恭維的表示？蘇聯紅軍是帮助人民解放軍的唯一外國軍隊呵！你不但不恭維，反而諷刺它，是為了什麼？」</p>
<p>蕭軍在同一天的「文化報」上，又發佈了一篇文章，寫幾個中國孩子在一家俄國人的門前，看俄國人喝茶，俄國人不讓他們看，要趕走他們，於是「來而不往，非禮也」，幾個中國孩子就把一塊石頭碰進去，打得俄國老太婆一個勁的呌啊呀。</p>
<p>從實質上，這篇小品，表現了中國孩子的頑強的反抗性，但在「解放區」裏的「同志們」却認為「這是一篇惡毒的挑撥中蘇民族仇恨的文學！」你想：中國小孩子都已變成了「挑撥中蘇民族仇恨」的健將了，這還不够奇怪嗎？</p>
<p>蕭軍是一個具有民族良心的作家，這可以從另一篇雜文「撫今追昔錄」上看得出來。「撫今追昔錄」一文，也是發表在同一天的「文化報」上的，全文包括兩組舊體詩，前面有小序，說明了這一次的國共戰爭是兄弟圍牆式的戰爭，因此，他認為萁豆相煎，實不能無所悸動！」茲錄蕭軍的原文如下：</p>
<p>「我知道中國人民的血，還要大量的流下去，但是撫今追昔，終難免有所愴然！萁豆相煎，實不能無所悸動！」</p>
<p>在「聞勝有感」的「並叙」中，蕭軍說：</p>
<p>「勝訊初傳，渾如夢境，似悲似喜，似懼似憂，萬情交縱，哭笑難成。溯憶八年抗戰以還，費却多少人民英雄鮮血，始獲此「初果」，惜敵氛猶未全戢，而萁豆之煎，却正沸沸也！瞰往瞻來，能無憂懼！」</p>
<p>蕭軍始終是抱着同一的態度，他不願盲從共黨，把萁豆相煎的事實看做什麼「人民反帝反封建反官僚資本的戰爭」，他却把國共兩黨看做一對「同根生」的親兄弟，所以蕭軍聽到「解放軍」勝利的消息，不是歡欣雀躍，却不得不似憂似懼，以致於愴然而又悸動了，這是作家的眞實態度的坦白表現，但他的周圍的「同志們」，却誣之為「裝腔作勢的，虛偽的人道主義的面孔，完全是有利於敵人而有害於人民解放事業的。</p>
<p>宋之的和其他幾個作家主持的「生活報」，成為了圍剿蕭軍的大屠塲。他們堅決的要蕭軍好好學習，改造自己，這一塲鬥爭，持續了兩個月以上，但是蕭軍始終堅持自己的立塲，不為所屈，於是「極端的個人主義者」「托派」「反蘇反人民」的各種帽子，便一一加到了蕭軍的頭上，他們一致攻擊：蕭軍有文人的優越感，有一點不滿意，所以才發牢騷，說怪話似的。其實，照我們看來，蕭軍是抱着一貫的眞實態度，反對任何的幌子和帽子！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕物價循環上漲後，一週來現鈔本已呈不敷週轉之現象。昨日中央銀行現鈔供應有限，市面現鈔更呈空前之緊勢。票據貼水，已做高至百分之十至十五。兩日來中央銀行出納科之櫃內櫃外，幾終日爲各行莊交涉提取現鈔之人員所擠滿。雖至入晚八九時，擁擠情形扔未稍戢。本市銀錢業方面，以各行莊有交換餘額存於國行，次日提取現鈔，本不應有任何限制，故日前曾派代表赴國行交涉，結果國行已首肯行莊如隔日有餘額存國行者，每家每日限提現鈔二百萬元。惟昨日國行因庫存現鈔短絀，而需要則隨物價狂漲而漫無限制，提現額再吿更改，規定凡行莊隔日存有餘額者，每百萬元得提現鈔十萬元。此項限制旣出，各行莊現鈔供源頓减，聞大如交通銀行，昨亦僅領得五十萬元，故各行莊應付客戶，亦大事限制，致市面現鈔週轉，頓呈空前之緊勢。一般急需現鈔者，遂不惜高價以票據貼進，致造成發行金圓劵後空前未有之高貼現率。</p>
<p>據各關係方面分析，現鈔緊勢之造成，不外下述種種原因：（一）物價循環猛漲之趨勢，業已超過印鈔機之產鈔率。特別在物價週期性之漲潮後，現鈔流通數量更相形見絀。（二）國行發行局之實職，供應軍餉支撥第一，而此鉅額之軍餉，例須以鉅額現鈔，經常運赴各地分發。（三）日來爲月中各業發薪之期，現鈔需要殷亟。（四）華南各地匯水差額已近對折，而西南成渝各地現鈔貼水奇高，本市現鈔，不斷遭搜羅外運，套匯圖利。有此數因，現鈔之緊勢，逐日呈尖銳化。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根，終日汎濫。蓋國庫日有鉅額支撥外埠匯款經常有到，而國行棉紗週來未拋，拋配黃金之數，亦屬有限，銀根遂呈收緊無望之勢。日拆始終在六十至六十五元間盤旋。</p>
<p>國家行局庫昨績差出十四億四千餘萬元，洋商各行差出十億四千餘萬元，大交換各行差入十二億一千餘萬元，小交換各行差入十二億七千餘萬元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據國行某關係當局昨語記者：該行發行鈔劵，日來一切照舊例辦理，並未有任何變更。而市面現鈔之短絀，除軍需支撥及適逢週期發薪之因素外，可能尙有人爲套匯，運往外埠圖利之因素在。渠特舉一例以明之，渠肯負責說，國行在本市發行之千元劵，以達數十億元，而市面始終未見有一張流通，顯見必遭人套取外匯圖利。唯渠認爲目前現鈔之緊勢，對物價不無穩定之功。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕華股市况，昨日趨勢甚疲，圈外壓力已弛，業內游資紛紛他移，全市過程走勢頗爲慘淡。各股高峯一從卽逝，行局鉅額差出，銀根由鬆而泛。惟因人心不佳，空旺於多，市勢續呈疲色。永紗晨初因銀根極濫，暗息暴落，市塲</p>

<p>踏破各種市塲，塲塲都在大漲。</p>
<p>小百姓在大漲着的價格前咋舌，但業中人，還是個個搖頭嘆息，只覺得利息都沒有漲出來。</p>
<p>最近幾天，常常會聽到「倒」的噩耗。昨天，什麼百貨公司，什麼橡膠廠，什麼煙號，什麼什麼，都有軋倒的消息出來。細細一打聽原因，家家都是被高利息拖倒的。</p>
<p>高利息：害得小百姓咋舌，害得工商業垮台；如此這般害人，可是財金當局，却正自鳴為得意之作！</p>
<p>各業都鬧現鈔荒，或謂信用膨脹，或謂物價過漲，正因為二者兼而有之，情勢就愈鬧愈烈。</p>
<p>需要大票，又是一致的要求了。</p>
<p>「尊重民意」的財金當局，不久當以事實表現。</p>
<p>這次現鈔荒，實在害煞職工階級，因為薪水多數用支票，也害煞了全市市民，因為每天買小菜，不能不用現鈔。</p>
<p>害人愈大的事，也愈能造成特種人的暴利，現時一百萬的支票，折實現鈔僅八十八萬元，眞是硬傷！</p>
<p>控制現鈔是什麼人，就是獨佔現鈔暴利的特種人。在這種人，眞可謂生財有道。</p>
<p>為了種種原因，金銀市塲，非開門不可，譬如現在，要大量敲進銀元，不很容易</p>
<p>又為了種種原因，要恢復金業交易所市塲，難如登天。譬如，繳證金，商人難；不繳，當局難。</p>
<p>為了這些那些，便因陋就簡，來個茶會化的金銀市塲了。</p>
<p>現在，已是官商協定，積極籌備時期。</p>
<p>籌備工作，對於金銀市塲，會不會發生影響呢？我的答復，當然有的，而且很多很大很重要。</p>
<p>譬如我是有會員資格的，開市後當然要抖擻精神幹它媽的一番。那末手裏總要有點黃貨白貨，這就有趁早多拖一點的必要了。</p>
<p>因這般想，別的會員也這般想，旣是人同此心，心同此理，黃白二物，現時當然看好。</p>
<p>昨天起，傳出許多不利民食的許多消息，什麼菲列賓向中國借米，當局已經答允了；什麼本市配米，勉強可以維持到六月底，不致中斷。</p>
<p>這些消息的當事人，都在同時活動着，無異給人一個信號，米市的大風雨要來了。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽昨晚太市盟主華聯以六十四比三十四大勝回力，繼續其聯賽中領導之地位。上半時廿四比十八，回力落後。華聯一路領先，回力雖在重重壓力之下，仍作艱困之奮鬥。昨晚因恩卡斯對麥令斯之戰改期，第一塲比賽延至六時半開始，康隊大勝西靑藍，五十六比廿九，上半時二十比十六，康隊多四分。體育館昨晚相當熱鬧，球迷二千餘人，都是雙方的捧塲者。</p>
<p>華聯大將，吳成章昨晚沒有出塲，因為他同回力有一些「小關係」他也是回力的指導。最初雙方都是慌張，在那裏「彈琵琶拼雙擋」，回力尤慘，僅靠罰球來撈得九分。可是十分鐘後，竟成另一局面，兩軍一度成膠着狀態，這個局面並不長久，華聯的狂攻猛襲，上半時遂成了相差一倍的結果。休息再戰，回力成了困獸猶鬥的姿態，明知大勢已去，仍繼續努力。昨晚華聯都很賣力，使回力於第二循環仍無雪恥復仇之機會。回力因福海天永芳始終苦戰，曹志吉球運不佳，魏啓琨雖沒有得分，但上半時籃下險球搶救甚多。</p>
<p>回力五人為王永芳，曹志吉，田福海，葉雲山，魏啓琨。華聯登塲者係傳金聲，劉福善，李震中，包松圓，張良雄。華聯阿傳初攻無效，後包傅各中一罰球，二比〇回力暫停，包再獲一分，回力王永芳咬緊牙關，弓開滿月，紀分牌上亦掛着二分。這裏可稱謂「雙慌時代」，華聯的罰球，回力的籃下球，都在彈琵琶。好容易包張添兩球，五比二徐叔源代魏，八分鐘內回力王葉復得二罰球，成七比四。</p>
<p>回力因王永芳發威，瞬息二球，形勢改觀，反以八比七超出，華聯嘉洲替出良雄，金聲的一分，打成八平。回力徐叔沅方以一分領前，但華聯將士用命，屢出怪球，成十五比十一，回力魏徐恢復原狀，不久又見十七比十一，相差三球，從此祗見華聯的世界，一隻隻進去，上半時廿八比十四。</p>
<p>下半時回力福海雲山頗有互相呼應之勢，無奈松圓的「輕描淡寫」，回力終難出頭，四五比廿八良雄代震中，小樂也表演出色，四八比三十李漢庭調傅金聲出，永芳福海還是困獸猶鬥，五十比卅四福海五次犯規，陳正淼入戰，不久叔沅替雲山，回力最後入「人自為戰」之態華聯終以六四比卅四大勝。</p>

<p>— 戚公述</p>
<p>B的方式是用以防禦對方運用特殊之進攻戰術，對方進攻者之中鋒是一位人高脚畏的球員，站在籃下儼如一根高柱，對付這個方式，正中衛必須選一人高脚長者來充當，控制着籃下一個小的區域，同時，要攔截對方之傳遞，看管着對方之擔任「柱」的職務之中鋒，她的任務至為繁重，除上述之職守外，幷須注意着別一個區域的動態，假如對方之鋒是攻破另一個區域而向籃下竄進時，這位正中衛在可能範圍內要迎截敵鋒，更要能够搶先一步，遲緩着該鋒之前進，阻撓着她，不使其有出手投籃和傳球給與中鋒之機會。</p>
<p>前兩項之移動區域防禦制是視對方之前鋒之動向而易形；現在研究的是視球之所在而定所應防守的區域，這是可以指定應防守之區域，每位守衛仍須要够敏捷，與其他兩衛有默契之聯絡，幷要有臨機應變之機警，以下是四個簡單的基本移動區域防禦方式，比較是高易於學習和運用的。這項移動區域防禦區是根據下列原則而成立的—守衛者所站住戰略上之重要區城，是接近籃圈，所有的獲分區域都在守衛所看管之下，這一種防衛制是劃分為三道防綫。進攻者假使能够衝破了第一重防綫，仍須要繼續衝破第二度度防綫，才能够竄到籃下，因為進攻者衝破了前面首重防禦綫時，後面兩條綫上的守衛就立卽予以截住。</p>
<p>在採取防衛時，雖可能指定所應防守之區域但并不是呆扳固定型的，區域之移動是要看球之移動之所在而移動其陣形。</p>
<p>防禦的守衛各站住戰略上的重重區域，有如上述。守衛者當對方中鋒在中圈接球發動攻勢時，守衛者三人之位置應佈的三角陣形，就是正中衛站在罰球界綫之前，左右兩後衛則在尖角之前看管着對方兩位前鋒。</p>
<p>圖一：球塲上之假想點緩是分別守衛出擊截球之區域，假如對方中鋒在中國發動攻勢，將球傳到其左或右鋒，皮球到達那段區域時，則該區域之守衛就出而迎擊該敵鋒，看管着她，直到她已將球傳遞給別人為止。每一員守衛都不必管其他敵鋒之動態，祇要見球在該鋒之手上，就須要上前看管着她。（未完·三）</p>

<p>〔香港航訊〕香港木球會主辦之網球賽，十六日情况熱鬧，球迷爭看單打入員最後的選手爭取準決賽權，四個球塲，都擠有不少的球迷，結果：葉觀雄，徐潤培，梁十驥，徐煒培，奪得準決賽權，將來爭取決賽權時，則由葉觀雄對徐潤培，梁子驥對徐煒培。</p>
<p>這四塲賽事，估不到進入爭奪準決賽權的階段，還是那樣平淡。比賽從五時一刻開始完了，最後一塲比賽（子驥對息格蘭）時間也僅是五時五十五分；換句話說，拖得最長時間的一塲比賽，也只是費了四十分鐘。比賽的戰程如下：</p>
<p>一號塲：葉觀雄對蔡永善，這一塲，在想像中，原有一番搏鬥的；他昨天觀雄打得特別有勁，更會爭取主動，一下長抽，跟着來一記短撇，把水善的氣力，弄得疲了，觀雄能有如此演出，當可奪取本　的錦標無疑。</p>
<p>兩盤的賽程：首盤，觀雄一開始，先勝了五局，這時，永善纔扳回一局，成績變了一比五；跟着，觀雄便以六比一先取第一盤，第二盤，觀雄再順利以六比二得勝。</p>
<p>二號塲：梁子驥對息格蘭，在比賽前，我說過：梁，息的打法，雖有點相似，但子驥常有準確的抽擊和有力的「切球」，息格蘭則只靠靸打，論贏的成數，則子驥稍佔優勢。果然昨天子驥把息格蘭制服了，而且勝球的比數是六比二，六比二，距離拉得那麼長，不能不算是子驥的成功。</p>
<p>三號塲：李文成戰徐煒培，文成的功夫，未到家，給煒培緊握戰果的發展。首盤，「大徐」卽以六比〇淨勝，第二盤，文成曾一度以二比一佔先：但此後又不濟，一口氣，給煒培勝回六局，再以二比六負去第二盤而被淘汰　四號塲：潤培對荷當，荷當在第一盤，還能力支，但一人第二盤，又是一面倒了。兩盤中，「細牛」先以六比四力勝一盤，第二盤又以六比二獲勝。凈勝了。</p>

<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>本市女籃雖並沒有高潮的情緒，也並不在低落中，證之上屆全運會的榮獲冠軍，我們應該加以扶植的。</p>
<p>以隊伍來說，逢聯賽終有五六隊左右參加，頗足以點綴了。至於每屆冠軍多為綠隊所包辦，固然是綠隊努力應有的收獲，而一方面可見新慧星的難產。這原因也因為女子每每為了婚姻的關係，以至中輟球事，這是無可補救的一個缺憾。</p>
<p>本市女籃出征之舉，在我所知道的，近年來就祇有綠隊到過石頭城下，固然轟動一時，其他就沒有過。據說今春菲島很有意思邀本市女籃前往赴征，這件美事，不知究竟有什麼阻撓：到今天無聞無問，以錢旭滄的面面俱到，不信不能斡旋其成功。也許因為本市籃球正值緊張之際，不願意分散精神吧”</p>
<p>談到本屆過程和形勢，大家看得很淸楚，綠隊還是穩坐后座，新軍黎隊極力卯上，可染指亞軍一席，星華人材不壞，似見精神不够，前次棄權於綠隊，實是要不得的。其次當為學生軍約翰，力隊仍難逃殿軍刧數。大勢如此，現在筆者擬對各隊依次來下一個烏瞰，聊表提掖女子籃球的微意。</p>
<p>論緣隊長勝不敗之原因</p>
<p>綠隊不媿女中英雌，據我所曉得，自從成軍以還，除掉賽男子規則敗於菲島黑白隊外，簡直是戰無不克，攻無不勝，保持常勝的榮譽，確是一個了不起的球隊。</p>
<p>過去：我覺得綠隊的長處，還僅僅是靠個人按術比人家高而已，到本屆，我更看到錄隊的優點，除上述原因，在戰拔方面，居然是進步得太快，所以，本屆非但能看到她們贏球，而且有好的表演。予觀衆以更進一步的印象，綠隊該是女籃驕子。</p>
<p>至於綠隊的所以能有如此悠長的歷史和球藝的進步，也許是讀者們想曉得一點理由，依筆者所知，可有下列幾個原因：</p>
<p>（一）人和：所謂人和者，亦卽管理得法，該隊管理謝益欽君對付每個球員是一視同仁，終是慰勉有加，使球員們能得到精神上的快感，自然大家努力了。同時她們終是每戰大勝，賽後自然大家嘻喀笑笑，沒有失敗隊伍必然有彼此怨怪的現象，因此大家的感情，祗有加深，不會渙散，這人和的一點，聽說是一個球隊成功的要素。</p>
<p>（二）動練：綠隊動練的情神令人欽佩，規定了日期，你有事情，必得事前正式請假，否則大家都會趕到的，不論是風霜雨雪，幾年來，沒有間斷過，那麼有今天的成功，當然也不是一件偶然的事了。</p>
<p>（三）指導好：綠隊到現在為止，指導的可分三班，初成立時該人稱第一班，那是錢旭滄，旭滄所敎授的完全是避重就輕，以已之長攻人之短而取勝。後來旭滄倦勸，一時物色不到對象，便由謝管理兼任。他是專與球員們商討研究為進退。到最近所延聘的孔廣益應是第三期了，阿孔的確為了指導綠隊，對女子籃球下了一番功夫，更加上他豐當的經騐，最近更能趕上時代，精益求精，綠隊在指導得人的三期，自然能錦上添花了。</p>
<p>一談到在戰術方面，我的觀感，目下的綠隊前鋒是懂而做得到；假動作阻檔：和運用熟練的方式；再加上準確的投射。於是較弱的守衛力量祇有任她們蹂躪了。守衛方面則應用交换釘人一節，轉變純熟而恰當，決非她隊所能望其項背的。</p>
<p>最後，談到個人方面，老將黃明媛王維珍的經騐，頭腦，功夫高人一等。吳愛蓮出手迅速，伍美矣這人殺辣。新人陸偉君竄勢有勁，更值得介紹的，乃是朱錦芸和石宗蘭兩位，後者齊力足，射籃準，奔有速度，姿勢美觀。至於朱錦芸更是有望，其彈力之足，壓倒羣雌，拿籃下球十九有把握，而出手快，腦筋淸晰，手上功夫靈活，無一不佳，年紀又輕，前途燦爛，筆者對朱石兩位具殷望焉！</p>

<h3 id="c139">南京路漫想 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 江上宇</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>南京路上的小販們，無論是賣「眞正麻紗舞襪」的，賣『香港肥皂』的，賣「海關拍賣下來的衛生衣」的，除了各有其一套驚人的辯才以外，還有，就是每人旁邊必有一二個甚至三四個常川不走的，低頭揀選的「顧客」。</p>
<p>在上海住久的人都知道，這些「顧客」是他們自己人，用來撐撐塲面，以吸引眞正的顧客的，因為人的心理，都是向大家都去的地方去。而且，你若仔細留心，可以發現上午在麻紗襪攤旁邊的假扮顧客，到下午又在賣肥皂的或衛生衣的攤子旁邊出現了。可見他們也是常常在作互惠的交換的。</p>
<p>做小生意是如此，做最大的生意，譬如說做官吧，又何嘗不如此？你如果要鑽出來，第一件事就是得弄一批人為你吹噓吹噓，而這批人最好是看來似乎與你無關的。如此說得多了，則別人自然而然也會相信起來，眞以為你頗有道理了。</p>
<p>謊話說得多了，老百姓就會相信的，這是德國宣傳大王郭培爾的名言。今日台上的袞袞諸公，有那幾個不是如此出身的？而我們老百姓呢，因為謊話聽得多了，而且克見眞有不少人在買，因此也就弄不淸楚，究竟誰在賣眞的麻紗襪，誰在賣一穿上脚就陂兩個大窟窿的斷綫絲襪了。。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>站在新世界喊三輪車，到河南路的都說是「朝東去」，到卡德路的都說是「朝西去」。</p>
<p>但河南路果眞是朝東去，卡德路果眞是朝西去麼？也不見得。如果站在外灘，河南路就是朝西，而如果是在靜安寺，卡德路當然是在極東了。然則，所謂「東」「西」者，也不過是自已站在什麼地方說什麼話罷了。</p>
<p>如果再想得玄一點，那就運「東」「西」這兩種相對的名詞也難存在。地球本來是圓的，這已是人人相信的事了。那末，如果從新世界一直向西，繞過地球的圈子，豈不是仍然可以到外灘；然則，外灘究竟該說是新世界的東面呢，還是極西面呢？</p>
<p>西洋有一句話說：兩極相遇。極西也就是東，極東也就是西。東西如此，左右亦然。</p>
<p>所以，今日天下之斤斤於思想的左右之分，實在也是大可不必的。因為在靜安寺之右者，在外灘之左。而從整個地球的圓形來說，則所謂左左右右，都只不過是人想出來弄得自己糊塗的名詞罷了。</p>
<p>「東」「西」分得愈多，方向也就愈亂；名詞創造得愈多，世界也就愈亂。</p>

<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>荷蘭雖是個小國，但她所屬各地的習俗却各有不同，有的且十分奇特。例如擁有居民近萬的斯達福司台，其地靑年男女的結合方式，還停留在五百年前的時代。若細細比較起來，竟和我國海南島生黎的婚姻習俗差不多。</p>
<p>如果一個斯達福司台的靑年男子，愛上了當地的一個女郎，他就會趁她外出時，奪過了緊在她腰間的布襲，襲中放着她的雨披肩。若是她任他將雨披肩搶去，那就表示她已默許了他的求愛。於是，每當星期一·三·五的晚上，他就可走到她的私室外（那是她父親特為她築在住屋旁的臥室），吹一陣口哨，然後從窗口爬進室內，和她共度良宵。直到她受了胎，兩人就宣佈訂婚。但在女郎未受胎前，訂婚是不允許的。</p>
<p>如果偷情的時間過了三月半載，而女郎尙未能懷孕時，她的父母親友就會鄙視她，懷疑她。而且，她的情郎如一旦對她發生了厭倦，也就可以隨時在她窗前放一個草人，宣佈和她絕交。</p>
<p>反之，如果女郎懷了孕，而她的情郎竟變心而拒絕了和她訂婚時，他便會受到當地居民嚴酷的懲罰。一羣靑年捉住他，鞭笞一番後，就將他縛在馬車頂上，送到女家去，幷關進猪欄中去和猪共眠食，直到他向女郎求情，且答應和她訂婚時，方能重獲自由。否則，他就休想走出猪欄。</p>
<p>訂婚後不久，一對未婚夫婦就在公共禮堂中舉行結婚儀式。結婚後，夫妻必須分室而住，直到新娘產下了第一個嬰孩，他倆才能開始同床而寢。</p>

<p>— 翼羣</p>
<p>前幾天，本談登了一篇關於「魚」的文章，我看過之後，便想起我故鄉湖南平江的魚來了。</p>
<p>我故鄉的池塘很多，有一處易子，屋前或屋後就必有一個塘乃至數個塘。因為池塘數目多，小孩掉下去淹死的事，不說常常發生，也是時有所聞的。要這許多塘有甚麼用呢？除了講究風水外，洗衣服和養魚是兩大主要功用。</p>
<p>養的魚，最普通有兩種二一種是草魚，鱗片大，體渾厚，肉質較粗，吃草；春季小魚下塘，八月中秋時就是二斤多重了。另一種是鰱魚，鱗片織細，體寬扁而色白，吃豬糞及草魚糞；春季小魚下塘，八月中秋，可有三斤多重。塘內如果養了這兩種魚，就得經常割草，倒糞。</p>
<p>放入塘中的魚，如過三年五戰，鰱魚可長大到一二十斤，草魚可長到三四十斤，像扁擔一般長。</p>
<p>除草魚和鰱魚外，比較稀罕一點的有所謂「龐頭」，形狀跟鰱魚一樣，只除了具有一個特別龐大的頭。因此，在我故鄕往往給頭大的人取個混號叫做「龐頭」。另一種所謂「靑豬」，這大穊是屬於草魚一類，形如草魚而色靑黑，據說很補，大病初痊的人吃了最好。</p>
<p>以上是最普通的家魚都是養在池塘裏的。此外，在小河裏到處都有魚蝦。漲大水的時候，就是捉魚的良機到了。在濛濛細雨中，披簑戴笠，河邊撒網，撈上來的都是翻騰眺躍的魚蝦，這種淸趣，我也曾體驗過的。雨止了，小河裏更頓然擠滿了人，有的用網撈，有的探手到石隙中去摸。熱心的人，白天捉了一天，晚上還燃點了多油脂的松柴去捉。</p>
<p>說到點松柴捉魚，我又想起了田裏的泥鰍。泥鰍都是利用晚上點松柴捉的。這種東西，味道之鮮美，我覺得要超過鷄肉多多。內行的人，有一種別緻的烹調法，是先把泥鰍放進菜油罐子裏，讓它喝飽了菜油，然後煮湯。這樣燒好的泥鰍，味道的確更佳</p>
<p>鄕間風俗，陰曆正月裏請客，宴席上照例有一碗魚，但往往是不吃的，只擺着做個樣兒，原因是冷天不便下塘網魚，不易買到。有時甚至不弄熟，擺上一碗生魚，這也許是為了預防那般不懂事或喜開玩笑的客人貿然下筷的綠故吧。</p>

<p>骰子是最古老和最普遍的賭具之一。在埃及和遠東的古墓中，都發現過用兩顆骰子作賭博遊戯的遺蹟。在古希臘，差不多每一次酒宴之後，都是以擲骰子作餘興的。他們的擲法與東方略有不同，用的骰子共三顆，擲出三個六的人「吃統莊」。</p>
<p>當羅為帝國正享受淫逸奢華的生活的時代，天之驕子的羅馬人，特別嗜賭。不過，賭博在民間是被禁的，所以，起初祗有貴族以「州官」的身份大作骰子戯。近來發現的一份記錄上面，記載奧古斯多大帝曾經擲出過一副「至尊實」，吃個統莊。羅馬帝國的另一員大將馬克。安東尼，於駐戍亞力山大港時擲過骰子。羅馬暴君尼羅也喜歡擲骰子。克勞狄一世，有一次居然寫了一本有關擲骰子的賭書。</p>
<p>結果賭風由上而下，民間亦趨盛行。於是，當局不得不制定特殊的法律，禁止任何人賭博，誰的家裏聚衆賭博，就要被不留情地拘入羅馬法院。</p>
<p>羅馬帝國崩潰之後，賭風亦隨之衰敗。後來，在中世紀，擲兩顆骰子的賭風復熾，傳遍歐洲，十字軍都喜歡擲。擲骰子的學校和擲骰子的公會居然紛紛設立起來，實為曠古未聞的怪現象。雖然禁賭的法律嚴厲異常，但是，武士們和他們的淑女依然擲骰如故，賭興毫不减淡。</p>
<p>骰子甚至還幫助過白種人奪佔美洲大陸的土地。十著印地安人很喜歡擲骰子，他們常以大塊的土地為賭注，與白種人作骰子戯。白種人運用他們的數學頭腦和有弊的骰子，總是獲勝，不勞而獲地贏得了大量的土地。</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰時，美軍亦愛作骰子戯。據某一軍事雜誌的估計，美國兵之中至少有百分之九十五酷愛擲骰子，並且時常的擲，雖然官方嚴厲，禁止賭博亦無所用。</p>
<h3 id="c145">黃牛滄桑史 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 景欣</p>
<p>黃牛，已成為三百六十行以外的一行職業了。電影院前是黃牛，銀行存兌金銀的是黃牛，路上賣買銀元的也是黃牛，今日上海，張開眼睛看，已盡是黃牛天下。有人懷疑黃牛是否能算為一種職業？其實那是多餘的。但看現今黃牛為數之多，分佈之廣，估計以做黃牛為生的人，成千成萬，當然能在三百六十行之外，佔一席位子了。雖然他們交易的對象，時常改變，這正像游收民族，逐水草而居一樣，也正是他們，成長過程間的變化而已。</p>
<p>黃牛的事業，是從米和日用必需品起家，賴美軍剩餘物資而發跡。到如今，已是很豐滿了。黃牛的產生，遠在抗戰期間。那時上海淪為孤島，四鄉的東西都不能運入租界，其中最嚴重的，莫過於糧食。前工部局當局為解救糧食恐慌，特運來洋米，發交米店平價出售。那時旣沒有配米證，於是弊端百出，黃牛也應運而生。他們擠在米店門前的長蛇陣隊伍裏，買得了米，轉賣給無法軋米或軋不到米的人家。他們憑着擠軋的能耐，來作為糊口之計。</p>
<p>黃牛之風一開，從此日長夜大。最初祗是軋米，後來油，糖，香烟等日用品發售之處，都有他們的踪跡。不久，工部局發現了他們的秘密，採用配購證的方法，把黃牛的生路斷絕，於是迫着他們不得不轉移陣地。那時出門是一件苦事，買票是第一個難題。黃牛找到了這個空隙，於是開始攒向火車站和輪船碼頭。</p>
<p>戰亂時候，一切都有些反常。在孤島的上海，生活雖很艱苦，但有許多人抱着醉生夢死的態度，過一日是一日，找尋娛樂的享受。一般暴發戶，更是悖入悖出，儘情享樂。所有娛樂塲所，無不客滿。戲院門口買票，也和買戶口米一樣，排着很長的行列。黃牛們銳利的眼光，看見又有機可乘，於是擴充地盤，戲院門前，也成了他們學生的堪所了。</p>
<p>勝利以後，美國剩餘物資大批湧到。這許多貨物，除少數是正式商行進口外，大多數是軍艦或商船私自帶來的。他們要急於脫手，利之所趨，黃牛們當然不會放棄。於是販賣美軍物資，成了他們最大的生路，跑船頭也是他們主要的工作。朱葆三路一帶，密層層的攤子，都是黃牛們豐富的草原。至於「八一九」後限價時期，更是黃牛們最最揚眉吐氣之時，大街小巷，盡是黃牛，此已是有目共賭，不用多說了。</p>
<p>經濟財政方案一改再改，從收兌金銀而有兌金銀，黃牛們更顯得活躍了。銀行要九時開門，但外灘一帶，隔夜已有黃牛在那裏活動了。十二時後戒嚴，他們會埋伏在隔壁的小弄裏，或黃浦中的舢舨上。他們並且採取聯合陣綫，局外人是休想插足。這一回他們收獲最豐，軋到一張申請書，就能享用十天半月。要不是因擠傷軋死，中央銀行仍繼續存兌的話，他們中有許多也許可面團團作當家翁了。如今則入銀元時代，「大頭小頭買進賣出」之聲，從朝至暮，不過這只是拾存兌金銀的一些渣滓，人數雖似浩蕩，獲利其實無多。黃牛們的黃金時代，看是已是過去了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Possible Overthrow of the Political Yuan Organization Law, Formation of New Cabinet May Be Delayed, Lu Zuofu to Head Communications While Concurrently Serving as Minister of Defense, Xu Kan to Remain as Finance Minister, Candidates for Deputy Yuan Chief Still Being Recruited <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The selection of members for He Yingqin's new cabinet is proceeding step by step. Lu Zuofu has been invited to serve as Minister of Communications, He Yingqin himself will concurrently serve as Minister of Defense, and Xu Kan will continue as Minister of Finance. However, as of the evening of the 17th, responses from both Lu Zuofu and Fu Bingchang, the intended Minister of Foreign Affairs, had not arrived in Nanjing. Meanwhile, Dr. Wu Yifang declined to join the cabinet on the 17th. Currently, only the Ministries of Judicial Administration, Interior, and Defense have been decided; the remaining five ministries and two committees have yet to be determined. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in particular, with its extensive powers, is significantly impacting the selection of candidates. News circulated on the evening of the 17th that Legislative Yuan members might propose a review of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issue. If so, the formation of the new cabinet will evidently be further delayed. He Yingqin spent the entire day of the 17th receiving guests at his official residence, with Chen Cheng, Wang Lingji, Zhu Shaoliang, Yang Sen, and others visiting him one after another. Some individuals expressed their pleasure at Chen Cheng's visit to Nanjing during the cabinet formation period, believing it would aid in the cabinet's preparatory work.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] Premier He Yingqin continued discussions with senior Kuomintang figures on the 17th regarding the formation of the cabinet. The new cabinet is expected to be formed early next week. According to sources close to He Yingqin, the progress of the cabinet formation as of dusk on the 17th is as follows: (1) Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Wu Zhongxin are internally designated as Ministers Without Portfolio, (2) Wu Tiecheng continues to firmly decline to join the cabinet, (3) Premier He invited Xue Dubi to serve as Deputy Premier. Xue has not accepted, (4) Huang Shaohong was invited to serve as Secretary-General; Huang has not accepted, (5) Ni Jiongcheng will still serve as Deputy Secretary-General, (6) Fu Bingchang and several other individuals were mentioned for the position of Foreign Minister, but Premier He has not formally invited Fu to take on the post, (7) Premier He intends to concurrently serve as Minister of Defense, (8) Xu Kan was internally designated as Finance Minister, but due to opposition from the Control Yuan, another candidate might eventually be chosen, (9) Lu Zuofu was invited to serve as Minister of Communications. Lu has not accepted, (10) Zhang Shijian accepted the position of Minister of Judicial Administration, (11) Wu Yifang declined to serve as Minister of Education, and other candidates are being considered, and (12) Dai Kuisheng will continue as Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] He Yingqin had to change his cabinet formation plans on the 17th because the Legislative Yuan refused to reconsider its decision to reduce the number of ministries and commissions. According to sources close to the Executive Yuan, the bill to reduce the number of cabinet ministries by ten will delay He's efforts to complete cabinet formation. He Yingqin and Acting President Li Zongren attempted to persuade the Legislative Yuan to reconsider their actions on the 16th. Li Zongren summoned twenty-two Legislative Yuan members, including Chen Guyuan, to his official residence on the night of the 16th, but failed to convince them that abolishing or amending the bill, which had already passed its third reading, was appropriate. It is understood that although Chen Guyuan expressed sympathy for the government's position, he believed that the necessary procedures for reconsidering the bill were "too complicated" and therefore refused to take action. Whether the President and Premier will further persuade the Legislative Yuan to revise its decision remains uncertain. If He Yingqin accepts the newly decided bill, he can invite non-Kuomintang figures into the cabinet by giving them positions as ministers without portfolio, thus realizing his original plan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 17th] Zhang Qun stated that he would return to Chongqing in a day or two. He received a phone call from He Yingqin on the night of the 16th, who instructed him to persuade Wu Tiecheng to accept the position of Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Reports indicate that Zhang Shijian will join He's cabinet as Minister of Judicial Administration. Sources informed our reporter that "Premier He personally invited Zhang to join the cabinet when he was in Shanghai a few days ago. On the evening before last (the 16th), Premier He again spoke to Zhang by long-distance telephone, requesting him to serve as Minister of Judicial Administration. Zhang politely declined both times, only agreeing to assist from the sidelines without holding an official title. The report that Zhang has agreed to join the cabinet is not factual."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to convene a Central Standing Committee meeting today to discuss Premier He Yingqin's invitation to join the cabinet.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th] Xu Fulin, Deputy Chairman of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party, has not finished his affairs in Guangzhou and will change his plans to fly to Shanghai and then to Nanjing on the 19th.</p>

The original letter states: "This time, as you take on the premiership, you face extraordinary times and bear a difficult responsibility.

With your insight, you surely understand this deeply and have planned it thoroughly. We agree to your forming the cabinet and hope that you will select talented and capable individuals who will live up to popular expectations. We humbly submit the following standards for the selection of cabinet members for your consideration." Attached are the standards for the selection of cabinet members: "(1) Carefully select honest, capable, progressive, and promising personnel, and do not allow corrupt, incompetent, or opportunistic individuals to enter the cabinet. (2) Carefully select personnel who can handle difficult tasks and work diligently, and do not worship idols, forcefully bring in the declining and mediocre, or corrupt officials into the cabinet. (3) Carefully select personnel who are impartial, serve the country, and serve the people, and do not appoint individuals solely for factional interests or to benefit the wealthy. (4) Those who have served as cabinet members for a long time or have held important military and political positions without showing any achievements, or those who have become wealthy through their military and political service, should not be included in the cabinet."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The entire membership of the Control Yuan is scheduled to hold a tea party at the International Association at 3:00 PM on the 18th to host Premier He Yingqin and provide opinions on issues such as the He cabinet's policy guidelines and personnel matters. At 3:00 PM on the 17th, the Control Yuan's political review and research group held a meeting, and each committee exchanged views on how to advise Premier He, deciding that the suggestions to He on the 18th should include the following points: (1) Strengthen the determination to reform, (2) Strengthen unity and progress, (3) Employ only the virtuous, (4) Establish the rule of law and severely punish corruption, (5) Rectify discipline and law, (6) Make cautious decisions.

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 17th] Well-informed sources say that an official is now studying the Chinese Communist implementation of the thirteen articles of the local peace in Beiping, believing that the Chinese Communists have actually completely destroyed the Beiping peace agreement signed a month ago. These officials are now closely watching the daily broadcasts of the Chinese Communists, waiting for Mao Zedong's permission to start peace talks, but are increasingly anxious about the future. An official said: If the implementation of the Beiping agreement is considered the Chinese Communists' style of dealing with future solutions, the hope for China's permanent peace seems very slim. He pointed out that the most obvious destruction of the Beiping agreement by the Chinese Communists was the prohibition of the circulation of gold yuan notes and the cessation of the publication of some newspapers, which "obviously does not comply with the thirteen articles of the agreement."</p>
<h3 id="e6">Legislative Yuan to Hold Sixth Meeting Today to Discuss Public Education Compensation Case, Military Reorganization Plan Also on the Agenda <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The sixth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 18th to discuss a total of four cases: (1) Consulting the President to legally declare the end of the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, and immediately cease the application of the temporary provisions of the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion. (2) The compensation of national public education personnel should be rationally adjusted as soon as possible. (3) Organize gold price deposits, stabilize finance, improve salary methods, protect savings, and unite the hearts of soldiers and civilians. (4) Please ask the government to quickly set a military reorganization plan, reduce the number of troops, tighten expenditures, verify the payment of salaries, and reduce non-combat personnel as much as possible to save national funds.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Amidst the active promotion of military reforms by Acting President Li and Premier He, Legislative Yuan members Wang Guangqing and forty-five others have recently proposed a resolution requesting the government to quickly set a military reorganization plan, reduce the number of troops, tighten expenditures, verify the payment of salaries, and reduce non-combat personnel as much as possible to save national funds, which has been included in the agenda of the Yuan meeting on the 18th. The method of this case is to ask the Executive Yuan to quickly convene a military reorganization meeting, formulate a reorganization plan, reduce the army, verify the payment of salaries, and ensure that the income of officers and soldiers is sufficient to maintain their livelihoods. The number of officers and soldiers is temporarily limited to 2.5 million, and other non-combat personnel and all unnecessary extravagant expenditures should also be reduced as much as possible. In the reasons for the proposal, the current expenditures of the National Army were listed, stating: It is found that the existing National Army is said to have 4.2 million officers and soldiers. Excluding the salaries of 150,000 people in Taiwan, the expenditures are calculated according to March of this year as follows: (1) Salary of silver dollars 19,272,476 yuan, calculated at the high price of silver dollars in early March, 3,300 gold yuan notes, equivalent to 63,599,170,800 gold yuan notes. (2) Supplementary cost of silver dollars 5 million yuan, equivalent to 16.5 billion gold yuan notes. (3) Public miscellaneous expenses of silver dollars 2,781,000 yuan, equivalent to 9.1773 billion gold yuan notes. (4) Business expenses are about 9.5 billion gold yuan notes. (5) Other emergency items are about 6.1 billion gold yuan notes. According to this number, the annual salaries of officers and soldiers require 12,585.176496 billion gold yuan notes. In the future, prices will continue to soar, and the number will increase many times. In addition, there are major items such as clothing, military fire, aircraft fuel, and military glutinous rice, which are said to be nearly 200 billion yuan per day, and 2 trillion yuan per year. If prices rise again, the increase can be inferred by analogy. At a time when the people's strength is depleted, tax sources are exhausted, and the national treasury revenue is sharply reduced, if a military reorganization plan is not determined and reductions are not made, the treasury will become empty day by day, and the economy will inevitably go bankrupt. Moreover, there are too many officers and soldiers, it is not easy to increase their compensation, their lives are uneasy, discipline is lost, the military's reputation is in danger, and the national treasury is wasted. Now the Yuan advocates simplifying institutions and implementing austerity policies. The largest expenditure of the National Army should be proposed to be reduced first. Moreover, it is found that the organization of military institutions is huge, and those who control materials arbitrarily embezzle them. Non-combat personnel spend most of the military expenses, and the soldiers in the front cannot eat their fill, the military is scattered, morale is low, the people raise troops with their blood and sweat, and the more soldiers there are, the more they harm the people, and the more officials there are, the more they harm the people. Complaints and grievances, loss of combat power, the plan to reorganize the army, how can it be delayed?</p>

<h3 id="e10">Air Force Sinks Huang'an Warship, Chongqing Still Anchored in Bohai Sea <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 17th] Regarding the Huang'an warship that fled on February 12, according to confirmed information, the ship has been sunk by the Qingdao Air Force inside the port of Lianyungang. It is reported that the ship was one of the eight ships compensated to our country by Japan, about 3,000 tons, and its weapons were not fully equipped. It was once incorporated into the First Fleet of the Navy. On the evening of February 12, it was anchored at Pier 6 of Qingdao Dagang. That night, its captain was staying at a private residence on the shore, and it was secretly opened by his subordinates and fled to the Communist army. The Communist Party radio station used it as propaganda material.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 17th] After the Huang'an warship fled and disappeared, the headquarters of the Second Naval District here received intelligence from various sources reporting the whereabouts of the ship. The naval base sent two ships, Taiping (Captain Jiang Qian) and Gu'an (Captain An Guoqiang), to search the sea. At that time, there was no air force assistance for some reason. Subsequently, after the results obtained from land intelligence and air force reconnaissance, it was confirmed that the ship had arrived inside the port of Lianyungang, and the personnel on board had landed and gathered in the former Salt Affairs Bureau in the city. After detailed research by the authorities, it was decided to send the Air Force to observe and bomb the ship with personnel from the naval base. Because the ship was a Japanese receiving ship, it had not been equipped and had no resistance. The ship was completely hit and sunk in the last bombing at noon on the 15th. From the 13th to the 15th, the Air Force dispatched once or many times every day, with more than five aircraft each time. Tonight, the reporter fully confirmed this matter from the responsible party of the Navy here. However, the responsible person only announced the date and location of the ship's sinking due to other reasons, and refused to disclose the exact number and list of people on board. Also, after the Huang'an warship was sunk, there was an interesting misunderstanding. One party reported that the Huang'an had not fled and was still in Jiaozhou Bay, currently shipping military supplies to Zhucha Island. Upon learning of this, I was quite surprised and immediately found out that it was the Huang'an, a merchant ship with the same name, not the Huang'an warship. There were many episodes caused by inaccurate information, and this was one of them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 17th] According to reliable information, the Chongqing warship is still on the Bohai Sea. The Air Force has dispatched many times to bomb it, and the ship resisted with fierce anti-aircraft fire. Another most reliable source said that the ship did not go to Dalian. When the Air Force here flew over the Bohai Sea, it encountered Soviet aircraft groups taking off from Lushun and Dalian. It is believed that Lushun and Dalian have excellent radar equipment, and the Chongqing can be replenished in many ports in the Bohai Sea.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] The reporter accepted the invitation of Zuo Zhi ren, the magistrate of Yizheng County, and made a special trip to the city, returning to Zhenjiang on the 17th. What the reporter saw and heard in the 24 hours he spent in this isolated city in Jiangbei was that the difficulties encountered in life were far greater than the pain given to the local government and the military and civilians by the tense military situation. The Communist army is active six or seven miles outside the city, and the sound of gunfire at night has almost become a common adornment of daily life. When the reporter went to the fortress near the La Temple in the north of the city to visit the positions on the morning of the 17th, he could see the activities of the Communist army from a distance at about 7:00 AM. Since the military authorities decided to block the traffic on the north bank of Jiangnan, the city has obviously felt a great lack of daily necessities, and the general prices are several times higher than those in Zhenjiang. Moreover, due to the small controlled area, military grain and people's food have also become a major problem. At present, the food and fodder for the security teams in the county, in addition to appealing to the provincial authorities for subsidies, only have the option of going out of the city to seize the Communist army's public grain to maintain two meals a day.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] The situation facing Yizheng is relatively calm. According to reports on the morning of the 17th, a part of the Communist army, about 7,000 people,窜to Donggou Town (about 30 miles east of Yizheng), and another 400 people harassed the National Army's fortress at the La Temple in the north of the city in the afternoon of the 17th. It has not been confirmed that the regular Communist army stationed between Tianchang and Yuyi has signs of moving south. However, the Communist army is actively carrying out the work of repairing the two highways of Yang (zhou) Yi (zheng) and Tian (chang) Yi.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] About 500 Communist troops attacked Shijiaqiao and Laosihui in the Jiangbei area of Zhenjiang on the morning of the 17th, and retreated westward after being counterattacked by the National Army.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The Legislative Yuan's subcommittee for reviewing the case of quickly stopping the conscription of military grain held a preliminary review meeting at 9:00 AM on the 17th, chaired by Yang Yifeng. The members spoke successively, summarizing the opinions into two types: One type believes that conscription of military grain is necessary, and although it has not been handled well in the past, reforms should be sought in the system and should not be abolished. Another opinion is that the malpractices of conscription of military grain are numerous, which is not beneficial to the country and harmful to the people, and should be stopped quickly to alleviate the people's difficulties. The discussion was held until 12:00 noon, and it was decided to continue the review on the 19th and send a letter to the relevant units such as the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Food, and the United Logistics Headquarters to send personnel to attend and explain at that time.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, made a speech on the matter of senators in a few areas requesting to stop conscription and military grain, saying: The Communist area has recently been fully mobilized to expand the army and conscript grain to support the front line. Before peace has not been realized and has not been guaranteed, the government must prepare for war and seek peace in order to protect the lives and property of the people. Therefore, stopping conscription and military grain is unwise and should not be done. However, the institutions and methods of conscription and military grain should be improved. It is also reported that the Communist Party has sent letters to senators in various counties in Jiangnan, forcing them to launch a campaign to stop conscription and military grain, stop military supplies, and stop organizing security teams. This is the Communist Party's biggest conspiracy, and we should be deeply vigilant.</p>

Lin's troops marched from Dexian to Jinan, then traveled by train to Xuzhou. They carried a large number of cannons. The troops arriving in Xuzhou represent approximately one-third of those who entered the pass. They are mostly equipped with Japanese weapons, with some American equipment as well. They are currently stationed near Xuzhou and along the Longhai Railway. Part of the force appears to be moving west toward the Pinghan Railway.

<h3 id="e20">Editorial: Preparing for Peace Talks <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>—Fourth of Our Hopes for President He—</p>
<p>On the day the Shanghai peace delegation returned from Beiping, the atmosphere of peace was momentarily strong. The saying "Although there are many difficulties, there is great hope" stirred public and private circles alike. Even rumors that the date for peace talks would be after the middle of this month and that the location would be in Beiping seemed to paint a picture of the Chinese Communists being willing to negotiate peace.</p>
<p>However, evidence from the news of the past week, such as the communist army concentrating over 300,000 troops north of the Yangtze River, the recent southward movement of over 100,000 men of Lin Biao's forces to Xuzhou, the bridgeheads along the north bank of the Yangtze River being threatened, the communist army's deployment for crossing the river being almost complete, and the Chinese Communist broadcasts denouncing Acting President Li and President He for still staging a "fake peace," all seem to contradict what the Shanghai delegation reported. "The mountain rain is about to come, the wind fills the tower." As far as the Jiangnan region is concerned, it has truly reached the eve of the mountain rain. The government and the people should no longer be able to rest easy!</p>
<p>At this time, a political storm has arisen within the government. The collapse of the Sun cabinet is not worth discussing, and the new cabinet, due to the reduction of ministries and the constraints of factionalism, has been slow to form, and even slower to consider the grand plan of how to negotiate peace. This is truly like a great fire already raging, while we are still waiting to repair the fire engines and mobilize firefighters. The danger is not difficult to imagine. Under the pressure of the Chinese Communist army, Acting President Li ordered President He to prepare for peace talks?</p>
<p>Regarding peace talks, regardless of their future success or failure, there are at least two points that the current government must urgently prepare for:</p>
<p>(1) The Strength for Peace Talks. Some may think that once peace talks are desired, there is no need to consider strength. However, without the strength to negotiate peace, there is no need to talk about peace, only surrender. Because if one side of the peace talks already considers itself powerless, or even if it has power but does not believe in its power, or cannot make good use of its power, then what is called peace talks is nothing but obediently following orders. Others may think that if there is strength, it is better to fight than to talk about peace. This is another great mistake. Of course, only by being able to fight can there be peace. Therefore, the strength for peace talks should be the strength for war. However, using the same strength not to seek war but to seek peace becomes the strength for peace talks. Therefore, using this "able to fight" strength to seek peace, then peace talks may almost succeed. If even this remaining "able to fight" strength is weakened, or if we do not even ask how much of this "able to fight" strength remains, thinking that these are all sufficient to hinder peace talks, and only seek to please the Communist Party by "catering to its wishes," we dare to say that peace talks will have no hope of success, and the result of surrender will be that the government suffers its humiliation and the people suffer its hardship.</p>
<p>President He has been in the revolution for decades. As a famous general who has contributed to the country, he has accepted a difficult task. His greatest task is to consolidate this strength that can both fight and negotiate peace, and to seek peace with sincerity. Where is this strength then? Mencius once said: Heavenly timing is not as good as geographical advantage, and geographical advantage is not as good as human harmony. The Yangtze River is a natural barrier between the two armies, and if the government can closely coordinate the navy, air force, and army, it cannot be said that it does not have geographical advantage. Today's problem is how to achieve "human harmony." If generals and generals do not get along, or soldiers and officers do not get along, or officers and the military do not get along, or soldiers and soldiers do not get along, or the military and the people do not get along, or the people and the officials do not get along, or the people and the people do not get along, or if one, two, or three of these exist, or even if all of them exist, how much strength remains? Therefore, to increase the strength for peace talks, we must strengthen the strength of war preparations. These seem to be contradictory, but in reality, they are complementary.</p>
<p>Therefore, the task of the He cabinet after its formation is first to unify the will of the central and local authorities, and to reduce the gap between military factions. Secondly, it must improve the treatment of soldiers, and especially make generals and soldiers share life and hardship. Furthermore, it must disregard everything to rectify the discipline of the army, so that the people are happy to be close to the soldiers, and all the corrupt habits of the army must be swept away. Finally, the harsh policies and complicated laws of the past should be abolished with the determination of a strong man cutting off his wrist, to show a fresh start with the people, and then the lost popular support can be regained. Only in a situation of internal and external unity, military and civilian integration, and unity of purpose can we boost morale and have the real strength to negotiate peace. Otherwise, the result of deceiving ourselves and others will be that no place will be spared the fate of Beiping and Tianjin!</p>
<p>(2) The Method of Peace Talks. We hope that the peace talks will succeed, and we should allow people's representatives to take on the responsibility of mediation and reconciliation in the process of peace talks. The failure of the past Political Consultative Conference and the lack of success of the Three-Man Committee were due to the fact that neither side put the people in their eyes. Everything was secretly discussed by the representatives of both sides. Although General Marshall participated in it, he was not a Chinese after all, and his pain was shallower, and success was naturally difficult. Now, learning from past mistakes, the government should advocate that people's representatives participate in the peace talks, and the progress of the peace talks, whether it is the proposal or consultation of conditions, or the discussion and debate between the representatives of both sides, should be made public every day, to show the supreme meaning of public interest and accept the constant criticism of the people of the whole country, so that many unreasonable and unnecessary disputes can be reduced, and even if there are disputes, it is not difficult to be convinced by public reason and justice, and receive the good fruit of mutual tolerance and concession.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the peace talks, the government must have a plan for flexible advance and retreat, and must never be forced into a corner, regardless of everything, to sign a treaty under duress. Because since it is called peace talks, there will inevitably be back-and-forth consultations, again and again. Who can predict the changes in the situation? If we cling to the saying "sincere desire for peace" and think that the communist army may as well advance to Guazhou and Caishi along the Yangtze River front, while our government must always remain in the place threatened by the communist artillery fire in order to negotiate peace, then misleading the country and harming the people will eventually be too late to regret. It must be known that peace talks are the business of peace representatives, and if there are any requests, they can be sent by telegram back and forth, and the government does not need to stay on the front line. If it is said that if the peace talks fail and there is another war, the government should not move its center of gravity, then it is even more inappropriate. Because if there is a war again, the command of the front line is the business of the generals, not the duty of the central authorities. Wang Fuzhi once commented on Emperor Huizong of Song: "Emperor Huizong fled south to avoid the bandits. The situation was pressing and he could not avoid it. Avoiding it was not enough to destroy him. In terms of the situation, not cutting off the head does not mean losing the life. In terms of reason... the feudal lords abandon their countries but do not lose their countries, and the emperor abandons the capital but still owns the world, and has not lost his hereditary inheritance, so he has not lost much... Only Li Gang did not understand this, cherishing this isolated city surrounded by enemies on all sides, retaining this court with its trivial discussions, leading these treacherous and partisan officials, sacrificing this attachment to luxurious life, and the soldiers of the captives retreated for a while, and the singing and dancing continued as before... In the end, the two emperors were captured, the six palaces were captured, the gold and silk were exhausted, and the empty city was frozen and starved, and they could not escape to make a living, and the upper and lower levels cut off their fate." After reading this passage, we deeply feel that Acting President Li and President He should make proper considerations about the location of the central government during the peace talks, and should not hesitate and hesitate to bring disaster upon themselves, so that future generations will look at today as today looks at the past!</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Under the leadership of Chairman Chen Cheng, Taiwan will "promote the Three Principles of the People, implement land reform, and strive for production to achieve the goal of people's livelihood." This is what Chairman Chen Cheng said when he met with our reporter at the Capital Hotel residence at midnight on the 16th. Chen said: "We want to use this as an experiment to solve the problem of people's livelihood. Can it be achieved without bloodshed?" Chen continued: "In the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Conference, it has been decided to reduce the rent for landlords by 37.5 per thousand, and it has been supported by people throughout the province. This can be used as the initial realization of land reform." Chen also said: "Our experiment can allow ordinary people to evaluate, which is better, to realize the Three Principles of the People or to implement other policies?" Chen's words truly have the determination to make Taiwan Province a model area for the realization of the Three Principles of the People. Chen's explanation of the general situation in Taiwan Province believes that the current financial, economic, and financial situation can achieve consistency, which is quite satisfactory. However, since people from other provinces have gone there, food is slightly lacking, so we are currently starting from restricting entry and increasing food production. Secondly, the problem of housing needs to be solved. Chen then said: "This Taiwan Provincial Administrative Conference can be said to be a manifestation of the politics of the whole people. The administrative chief and the speaker of the council both participated, and they were able to express their opinions freely, so the harvest was excellent." Chen was very satisfied with this. Finally, when the reporter asked about the release of Zhang Xueliang, Chen said: "This is not a matter for local officials."</p>
<h3 id="e22">US ECA Continues to Aid China: New Bill Stipulates Until the End of This Year, Still $80 Million Unused <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 16th] According to officials of the ECA (Economic Cooperation Administration) in charge of aid to China, the economic aid to China bill currently in the US Senate will enable the ECA to continue aid until about the end of June this year.</p>
<p>This bill was proposed in the House of Representatives on Tuesday by John Kee, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. At that time, John Lapp, head of the ECA's China Division, and S.M. Cleveland, director of the ECA's aid to China program, stated that the bill was an action bill.</p>
<p>Lapp and Cleveland pointed out that the characteristic of this bill is to supplement the Aid to China Act of 1948, which stipulated one year of economic aid to China from April 3, 1948. This supplementary bill will continue Congress's authority for economic aid to China until December 31, 1949. However, the two officials stated that under this authority, all available funds can only continue aid to China for three months.</p>
<p>According to the congressional appropriation of $275 million last year for economic aid to China, approximately $80 million has not yet been used. However, the ECA expects that before the current bill expires at midnight on April 2, $22 million will have to be withdrawn from the unused aid to China funds to purchase new approved cases of reconstruction materials.</p>
<p>Therefore, under the proposed extension of the Aid to China Act, there will be a balance of $58 million available to continue helping China. According to Craig and others, at the current rate of expenditure, the funds will be exhausted by the end of June. Cleveland said that the ECA does not intend to use this small appropriation for the entire period stipulated in the supplementary bill. According to the supplementary bill, aid to China will be extended until the end of 1949.</p>
<p>When answering questions, Lapp and others said that the ECA is satisfied with the issues covered by the new bill and the extended period. Cleveland and Lapp said that the ECA has not considered recommending a new economic aid to China plan, nor is it responsible for making any recommendations. Cleveland said that whether to continue aid to China will be decided by the State Department, the President, and Congress. It is said that in the coming weeks, the funds for the reconstruction of South China will be used to purchase rice, cotton, wheat, and implement the Chinese rural reconstruction plan. It has been pointed out that although Congress has appropriated $275 million to implement the Chinese economic reconstruction plan, the maximum amount of funds approved for this plan can be up to $338 million. Lapp and Cleveland said that the ECA does not require the $63 million appropriated by the John Kee bill. The main point of the bill is to extend the effective period so that the balance of the original $275 million in aid can continue to be used for aid to China after April 2.</p>
<p>If Congress passes the John Kee bill on April 3, 1949, both the House and Senate must pass a new appropriation bill so that the unspent balance of the original $275 million can continue to be used for aid to China after April 2. The John Kee bill stipulates that before Congress passes this appropriation bill, the Reconstruction Bank can advance the ECA $50 million for aid to China.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Stones From Other Hills: General Barr's Remarks in the US, Believes the National Army's Failure Was Due to Lack of Fighting Spirit, Another Reason Was Lack of Talent and Corruption <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] General David Barr, the former head of the US military advisory group in China, who has withdrawn and returned to the United States, spoke with reporters today about the key to the victory or defeat in the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communists. He said that the major problem with the defeat of the Chinese government army was the disintegration of military morale, and no single defeat could be attributed to a lack of weapons and ammunition. Another major reason was the lack of talent and corruption in the military. The Chinese government army can be said to have embraced defeatism from top to bottom, especially since the soldiers' salaries were low and their rations were poor, which led to even less fighting spirit. A large part of the weapons used by the communist army were American equipment seized from the National Army. He had never seen any Soviet equipment in the communist army. The claim that there were Soviet officers in the communist army was only seen in rumors and had no factual basis. The US military aid of $125 million worth of materials reached the front line only to a limited extent before the collapse of the National Army, and most of it is now being preserved by the Chinese government in Taiwan. Even now, the communist army has only a few aircraft. The National Army, at its peak, had about 460 US-made B-24 and B-25 bombers and B-51 fighters during the war, of which 275 could be used in combat. Barr said: "There is corruption in the Chinese government army. Although I have no formal report, I see that officers' salaries are low, but they always travel in expensive cars, which cannot help but arouse suspicion." Barr estimated that the Chinese government army had a total of 3 to 4 million troops, including 100,000 in the air force and 50,000 in the navy. Barr also said that although Chiang Kai-shek has stepped down from the presidency, he still has a great number of supporters in the country. The US military advisory group was about to make a great contribution to the Chinese government army when the situation changed drastically and it had to withdraw.</p>

<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 17th] Xundian in Eastern Yunnan was previously besieged by more than 2,000 bandits. It was repelled by the full force of the security team.

<h3 id="e34">Severe Economic Crisis in North China, Price and Wage Problems, the Communist Party Feels Extremely Troubled, Unable to Thoroughly Implement Planned Policies <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The economy of North China under the control of the Communist Party is currently in a serious crisis, which has not yet been resolved. Some of the news broadcast by the Chinese Communist radio in recent days reflects the suffering of the people's lives. At present, the Communist Party is still allowing the economy of the cities to retain the original appearance of the old era. This is not because the Chinese Communist Party recognizes the economic form of North China as a reasonable development, but the fact is that it is temporarily unable to thoroughly implement its planned policies. According to the broadcasts of the Chinese Communist radio, the serious economic phenomena in North China are one, the price problem, and the other is that the wages of workers cannot support their families, and they are making requests to the Communist Party authorities. For the former, the Communist Party's countermeasure is to actively increase production in order to solve this crisis. The People's Bank has decided to hold production loans to support private and state-owned enterprises such as steel, textiles, transportation, and public utilities that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. Regarding the latter, because the wages earned by workers are not enough to solve their lives, they cannot achieve the class interests advocated by the Communist Party, and they are gradually becoming resentful. Therefore, the "payment in kind system" has been adopted as a remedy. This "payment in kind system" was originally implemented in the Northeast and is now also being extended to North China. The method is that the cooperative supplies 70% of the workers' wages in kind, so that they can be unaffected by price fluctuations. Yesterday, the Tianjin news broadcast by the Chinese Communist radio openly admitted that wage problems occurred between labor and management in the Zhenzhong Rubber Factory and the Beiyang Match Factory. The workers of the Zhenzhong Rubber Factory stated that their wages were too low, which affected the workers' production emotions. After mediation by the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, the wages have been increased. The Beiyang Match Factory's wages were too high, which affected the expansion of reproduction by the capital. After the hard work of the office, the wages were reduced, but the capital was ordered to earnestly improve safety equipment and bear the medical expenses of those injured on the job, in order to improve the workers' living conditions, thereby increasing production and solving the shortage of materials and panic. According to reliable sources, after the workers in the Northeast and North China were controlled by the Communist Party, their working hours have been increased from eight to ten hours, and "labor heroes" and "piece-rate wages" have been used to reward diligent workers. Recently, three or four out of ten of the news broadcasts by the Chinese Communist radio have been of this kind of news, which alone is enough to reflect the difficulties of the Communist Party's situation.</p>
<p>Now, in order to increase production, the Chinese Communist Party is launching a "production competition" with the theme of welcoming the first May Day Labor Day after liberation, encouraging workers to become labor heroes, improving work efficiency, increasing production, and assisting the Communist Party in "liberation work."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Government transferred four county magistrates on the 17th: Zhu Gengsheng of Songyang was dismissed and arrested for colluding with bandits, and Li Hetao was appointed to succeed him.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 17th Dispatch] Zhejiang Chairman Zhou Yan believes that county magistrates and self-defense forces have recently been repeatedly involved in colluding with bandits, dereliction of duty, and loss of firearms. However, those who guaranteed them have never been investigated. In this extraordinary period, it seems that the relevant authorities should earnestly handle the guarantees of the county self-defense forces, commanders, deputy commanders, police chiefs, and other military leaders at all levels to prevent accidents. After careful discussion at the provincial government meeting, the matter was handed over to the Personnel Section of the Civil Affairs Department for review.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 16th Dispatch] The Philippine Senate, which had been in recess for three weeks due to the struggle between opposing factions for leadership in the elections, reconvened today. The first bill to be considered is one that deems all land acquired by foreigners as a violation of the Philippine Constitution and will pass a disposition bill. Authoritative figures among the overseas Chinese here believe that this bill will greatly affect the interests of overseas Chinese in the Philippines. The bill stipulates that all land purchased by foreigners after the effective date of the Constitution in 1936 must be transferred to persons legally authorized to manage the land in accordance with the law. If the transfer is not automatically carried out in accordance with the law within the specified period, the Philippine government will auction it off on behalf of the owners. The bill has now been submitted to the House of Representatives for approval. Furthermore, this measure will also affect the British, French, and Spanish expatriates here, as they also control a large amount of real estate. However, this bill will not affect American expatriates, as they enjoy the same civil rights as Filipinos under the Bell Trade Act.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Washington, 17th Broadcast: Acheson's negotiations with Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson have successfully concluded, and a joint communiqué has been issued. Mr. Acheson emphasized that the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is purely to maintain world peace and that it was drafted based on the United Nations Charter. Mr. Benediktsson emphasized that Iceland's situation is different because it has no army and stated that Iceland will not agree to allow the military forces of any country to use Iceland's bases in peacetime.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th Dispatch] The eight founding nations of the Atlantic Treaty, namely the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, and Canada, have jointly invited Denmark, Iceland, Italy, and Portugal to participate in the formal signing ceremony of the Atlantic Treaty in Washington on April 4 as founding nations. The invitations specifically request the foreign ministers of the four countries to come to Washington in the first week of April to attend the signing ceremony. The draft of the Atlantic Treaty was sent out simultaneously with the invitations, and its contents will be announced simultaneously in the capitals of the participating countries tomorrow. The eight countries invited Denmark and the other three countries to be founding members of the Atlantic Treaty. Ireland was not included because the Irish government did not give a clear response to the previous informal invitation. Ireland stated two weeks ago that it has no intention of participating in the Atlantic Treaty until North and South Ireland are unified. Diplomatic figures here expect that the responses of Italy, Portugal, Denmark, and Iceland accepting the invitation can be delivered to Washington before the weekend. Portugal's position has been clearly stated in negotiations held in Lisbon and Washington. Italy and Iceland have also expressed their willingness to participate in the treaty in informal contacts. Denmark has requested guarantees regarding the Greenland base, requiring that the base in Greenland not be borrowed except in emergency situations. Italy has no problems with participating in the Atlantic Treaty on the part of its government. Although the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party oppose it in the parliament, the ruling party holds a majority in the parliament, so the opposition party will not be able to do anything.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th Dispatch] People here believe that under the current circumstances, Spain will not be invited to participate in the Atlantic Treaty, and Portugal, although it has close relations with Spain, will not object to Spain's failure to participate.</p>

Previously, Sadak declared in Congress that Turkey is in contact with Britain and the United States in order to conclude a Mediterranean alliance. The nature of the alliance is important, but there has not yet been a real decision. This treaty will include Britain, France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Spain may also join in the future.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 17th Broadcast: Rome Report, today the Italian Communist Party has begun action against the Italian government participating in the North Atlantic Treaty. In Congress, Communist Party members are delaying the vote with extremely lengthy speeches, having spoken for 23 consecutive hours, with 80 Communist Party members still prepared to continue speaking. In the city of Terni in central Italy, workers held a large demonstration. Police charged at the workers with jeeps, killing one person and injuring 14. Mass protests were held last night and today in Milan, Genoa, Turin, Naples, and other cities, but no incidents occurred.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 17th Dispatch] The Italian Communist Party violently attempted to prevent Italy from participating in the Atlantic Treaty in the House of Representatives this morning. The debate on the treaty in the House of Representatives has been continuing from yesterday afternoon until noon today. The speaker became impatient and left the chamber twice, but Communist Party members insisted on exercising their right to speak. According to the constitution, each member must be allowed to speak for at least five minutes, and more than 100 members have requested to speak one by one. Therefore, it is expected that the debate may continue until late at night or even tomorrow morning before a vote can be taken. Prime Minister Gasperi attended the debate in the House of Representatives all night, becoming the main target of the Communist Party members' attacks. Some called him a liar, a fool, and told him to get out of the chamber. Mr. Gasperi tried to stand up and speak three times, but was prevented by Communist Party members singing "The Internationale." At the height of the debate, Communist Party members and Christian Democrats began punching each other, which lasted for 20 minutes before stopping. When Gasperi was finally able to stand up and speak, emphasizing that Italy had benefited from the Marshall Plan and must participate in the Atlantic Treaty, a Communist Party member shouted "No more bowing to Wall Street" and "Down with American imperialism." The speaker was unable to maintain order and left the chamber for 15 minutes. The government has taken strict security measures in fear that the Communist Party may launch a riot after the vote. The Italian General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the Communist Party, has declared that it will launch a nationwide strike immediately after Congress approves participation in the Atlantic Treaty.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 17th Dispatch] Swedish Defense Forces Commander-in-Chief Jung stated that in the event of war, Sweden can conduct a delaying defensive war alone for a considerable period of time, but will eventually need foreign assistance. Sweden has a curved coastline, a large area, and treacherous terrain, so even if the enemy has an advantage, it will definitely not be able to occupy all of Sweden in one fell swoop. Mr. Jung said that although Sweden maintains neutrality, the Western countries have invited Denmark and Norway to join the Atlantic Treaty, which shows that they attach importance to the position of Scandinavia. Therefore, once a war breaks out, the Western countries will definitely be able to assist Sweden.</p>

<p>Expanding Military Strength and Suppressing Human Rights</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 16th Dispatch] The State Department issued a statement today explaining that the treaty obligations of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania and the rights of other signatory countries remain unchanged. The statement said that the U.S. government therefore "reserves all rights under the treaty, including the right to invoke appropriate procedures for interpretation and enforcement." The statement accuses the three countries of violating their treaty obligations and accuses the Soviet Union of hindering the implementation of the treaty. The recent trial of religious leaders in Bulgaria and Hungary is cited as an example of these countries violating the treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th Dispatch] British Minister of State McNeil told the House of Commons today that Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, with the support of the Soviet Union, are preventing Britain and the United States from establishing supervisory bodies to ensure the implementation of treaty provisions. Romania and Bulgaria have both violated the military provisions of the treaty, and Hungary is also planning to expand its military strength in disregard of treaty restrictions. The three countries have also violated the provisions of the treaty regarding the protection of human rights and the economic section. In the 18 months from the signing of the treaty to the 15th of this month, the treaty stipulated that any disputes regarding the implementation of treaty provisions should be jointly acted upon by the heads of the diplomatic missions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union stationed in the capital of that country. At the end of 1947, Britain and the United States decided to require Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to inform them of the status of their national troops in accordance with the treaty provisions. However, the governments of the three countries refused the British and American requests on the pretext that the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union must act jointly. The British government therefore had to recognize that these former enemy governments colluded with the Soviet government to avoid fulfilling the treaty provisions.</p>
<h3 id="e53">MacArthur States No Intention of Retiring: Plans to Continue Serving Until the Signing of the Japanese Peace Treaty; Japan Welcomes MacArthur's Statement <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] General MacArthur issued a formal statement at noon today stating that he intends to remain in his position as head of the Allied General Headquarters in Japan until the signing of the peace treaty. He has no intention of relinquishing his current position as long as he is not transferred by the U.S. government to serve elsewhere.</p>
<p>MacArthur issued this statement to deny recent foreign reports speculating that the control work of the occupation of Japan would be taken over by civilians and that MacArthur would retire accordingly. He dismissed these reports as rumors with no basis in fact.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 17th Dispatch] A Japanese government spokesman said on the 17th that he welcomed MacArthur's statement. Cabinet Secretary Masuda represented Prime Minister Yoshida in saying: "We welcome General MacArthur's statement with the greatest gratitude, as the General, who has made great contributions to Japan's reconstruction and democratization, will continue to serve until after the signing of the Japanese peace treaty."

<p>Cuba, Australia, and the Philippines Oppose the Sino-Canadian Compromise Proposal</p>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success, 16th] Norwegian Representative Soht urged the Security Council today during the debate on the Indonesian question to establish some kind of monitoring system to see whether the rules of humanitarian warfare are also being strictly observed in small-scale battles. In the war in Indonesia, both sides had accused each other of inhumane acts. He believed that the United Nations must do its best to prevent atrocities from happening. Regarding the Indonesian question itself, Soht supported the suggestions of the Canadian and Chinese representatives, advocating preliminary talks to determine the status of the Republic, which could make the round-table conference proposed by the Netherlands in The Hague a success. French Representative Chauvel also supported the Canadian proposal. Cuban Representative Alvarez argued that the Netherlands had not implemented the Security Council's resolutions and attempted to solve the problem in its own way. He demanded that the Security Council order the Netherlands to strictly implement the Security Council's resolutions, believing that the leaders of the Indonesian Republic must be completely restored to freedom, the Indonesian Republic must return to Yogyakarta, and military action must be stopped. Only after these prerequisites were met could the Security Council consider various proposals on the Indonesian question. Australian Representative Holt expressed dissatisfaction that some countries that had previously supported the Security Council's resolutions were now asking the Security Council to overturn its resolutions. He hoped that the Security Council would act cautiously on the proposals put forward by China and Canada to avoid violating the Security Council's resolution on the Indonesian question of January 28.</p>

<p>[Reuters Berlin, 16th] The Speaker of the West Berlin City Council, Saul, revealed that currency reform in West Berlin will be implemented soon. It is rumored that after the new currency reform, East German marks will not be allowed to circulate in West Berlin, and the West German mark will be the only currency in West Berlin.

Alvarez hinted that other neutral countries on the Security Council have no plans to reopen the debate on the Berlin issue, unless requested by a major power. Well-informed sources said that the United States, Britain, or France have no intention of bringing up the currency issue again. The US State Department issued a statement saying that Western countries are still prepared to consider a fair solution to the currency issue to protect the legitimate interests of the people in both East and West Berlin. The Currency Committee attempted to resolve this problem technically, but because of the actions of the Soviet Union, this problem has expanded into a technical problem and therefore cannot be resolved.</p>

<p>Business on the South China Line is Picking Up</p>
<p>According to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the passenger and freight transport business on the Yangtze River Line has been very sluggish recently. Passenger transport is only half of what it used to be, and freight transport is even more scarce. The cost of a round trip between Shanghai and Hankou is huge. Although the Shanghai-Hankou Line has been reduced to one flight every ten days, there are still too many empty seats, and the revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced. The company is currently considering reducing it to one flight every half month. The company's passenger and freight transport on the South China Line has improved, especially in passenger transport, which has made great progress. For example, the maintenance of order on board and the crackdown on passengers without tickets have been successful. Currently, important ports on the South China Line, such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou, have regular express ships that operate regularly.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Education Bureau began distributing yesterday to various schools the municipal government's allocated water and electricity subsidies for March.  Teachers and staff received 11,700 yuan per person, and manual laborers received 5,850 yuan per person. Those whose kerosene costs were advanced by the Education Bureau will not receive payment temporarily; a separate notification will be issued regarding supplementary payment of the remaining balance after settlement. The Municipal Elementary School Teachers and Staff Association believes the amount of kerosene costs that each school should pay to the Education Bureau had already been determined and publicly announced.  This time when issuing the funds, deductions could have been calculated based on the actual number of employees at each school. If a separate notification is issued again, the value of the currency will decline during this period of rampant inflation if payment is delayed for one to two weeks, which will have a significant impact on all teachers and staff. After representatives Li Zhanren, Huang Shiping, Mao Wenpei, and others consulted with the Education Bureau, it was discovered that the error was due to a discrepancy in the reconciliation between the petroleum company and the municipal bank.

<h3 id="e80">Wang Xiaolai Sends Telegrams to Government and Communists: Calls for North-South Trade and Currency Exchange; Seek Progress Through Stability, Stability Through Progress; Restore Economic Order, Ensure Minimum Living Standards <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the China National Products Manufacturers Association, yesterday telegraphed Acting President Li, Premier He, and CCP leaders Mao Zedong, Ye Jianying, etc., regarding the issue of North-South trade and currency exchange, putting forward his proposals. The original telegram stated: "(Salutations Omitted) I humbly believe that stability to seek progress and progress to seek stability are mutually beneficial. At present, seeking stability and seeking progress are both subjective and objective needs, and are universally desired. The essential conditions for stability and progress are that people should make the most of their talents, land should be utilized to its fullest, materials should be used efficiently, and trade should flow smoothly. These four factors must be implemented simultaneously, but their order of priority should be determined by the actual situation and changes. The reason why our people cannot fully utilize their talents, the land cannot be fully utilized, and materials cannot be fully utilized is that goods cannot flow smoothly. This is why the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, advocated building 100,000 miles of railways and one million miles of highways to facilitate transportation. However, the current means of transportation are already unable to meet the needs. If artificial obstacles are added, it will inevitably lead to goods not being able to flow smoothly, thereby preventing people from fully utilizing their talents, the land from being fully utilized, and materials from being used efficiently. Our country's agricultural, industrial, and mineral products vary from east to west and north to south. If there is no mutual exchange of goods to make up for deficiencies with surpluses, then not only will the people's living standards inevitably decline further, but also the economic order will be disrupted. Even the government will inevitably expend more effort. It is difficult to achieve progress in instability, and it is difficult to achieve stability without progress. The current resumption of postal, telegraphic, and shipping services between the North and South has brought considerable stability to people's minds and has shown signs of social progress. In the industrial and commercial sectors, it is believed that the next step should be trade and currency exchange, and preparations are being made to increase processing and importing in the hope that the economic order can be restored to normal and the minimum living standards can be ensured. Therefore, I respectfully submit my humble observations in this telegram, hoping that you will review and approve it promptly to implement trade and currency exchange, which will benefit both the public and private sectors. I bow in reverence. Wang Xiaolai, Yinxiao."</p>

Yangshupu Middle School was established last year, with District Chief Wang Guoping concurrently serving as principal. It has three grades in junior high school, with over 100 students. Due to the lack of school buildings, classes were held in the district office building last year. Later, seeing that the school building of Yangshupu Central National School was quite large, it was agreed with the Education Bureau to borrow two classrooms from the school as classrooms for the middle school. However, some of the classrooms of the school were subsequently occupied by transit troops, causing the middle school to be unable to hold classes. They then vented their anger on the school. At 8:30 a.m. yesterday, more than 100 middle school students had a verbal conflict with the teachers and staff of the school, which turned into a full-scale brawl. The school's doors, windows, lights, tables, chairs, and textbooks were all destroyed, leaving a mess on the floor. The clothes of more than ten teachers and staff were splattered with ink. National School teachers Shi Wenda, female teacher Yang Jingzhi, and several elementary school students were injured. The school reported the incident to the Yangshupu Police Station, which sent officers to stop the violence. After hearing the news, Education Bureau Director Li was extremely angry and immediately ordered Inspector Yu from the Supervision Office, Inspector Shen from the Secondary Education Section, and Inspector Zhu from the National Education Section to go to the school together to investigate the damage and consider solutions. The school has temporarily suspended classes and is awaiting a resolution.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Beijing Type (6) <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>A report on a city during and after "Local Peace"</p>
<p>(6) The Reorganization of the Army</p>
<p>The National Army originally stationed in Beijing consisted of eight armies and twenty-five divisions. With the exception of the 104th Army, which is still in the city assisting with security duties, the rest have been moved outside the city. According to the agreement, they are to be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army within a month, which is certainly a major issue! In this situation where military affairs are paramount, the strength of the army is worthy of attention! If these two hundred thousand plus people are not reorganized, the CCP would at least have to station two hundred thousand plus people near Beijing to monitor them to prevent accidents. Originally, after the end of the Pingjin Campaign, Lin Biao's troops could have been transferred south to make up for Chen Yi's losses in Jiangbei and strengthen the forces crossing the Yangtze River. However, because the National Army near Beijing had not yet been reorganized, this task could not be accomplished. Therefore, the CCP attaches great importance to the army reorganization work and is actively carrying it out.</p>
<p>According to the original consultation, the original establishment and personnel would be reorganized. However, the current situation is developing. Whether the CCP will reorganize according to the agreement or carry out a major reform and reorganization is still unknown. The morale of this part of the National Army is very high, and they are very willing to fight with the CCP. In addition, the many humiliating events in this local peace have given them tremendous spiritual stimulation, and the fire of anger in their hearts is burning even more fiercely! If it is not reorganized according to the original agreement, this volcano may erupt.</p>
<p>Before I left Beijing, various rumors were being spread secretly and widely: such as Chen Yi's troops suffered two defeats in Jiangbei, with losses of more than 400,000 to 500,000 people. Ma Bufang, dissatisfied with Fu Zuoyi's surrender, has already sent troops from the northwest to attack, and Ma's cavalry has reached the Chengde area. After Okamura Neiji returned to China, Japan has sent troops to land in the Qinhuangdao area, and the train from Beijing to Shanhaiguan is no longer running. … Various rumors without factual basis are widely circulating among the National Army troops in the suburbs of Beijing, further strengthening their fighting spirit. This does not mean that these rumors are reliable, but it shows that they are still missing the central government and hoping for an opportunity to serve the country. The National Army in the suburbs of Beijing has enough food reserves for about three months, and weapons and ammunition are also quite sufficient. If the CCP does not handle it well, it may still be a loophole that could cause problems.</p>
<p>The CCP also knows about the spread of these rumors. They believe that this is being spread by Kuomintang military intelligence and Central Statistics Bureau agents lurking in Pingjin. Therefore, the Beijing Garrison Command has strictly ordered officers and soldiers of the 19th Regiment of Military Police scattered among the people to quickly report, submit their weapons, or face punishment. At the same time, the CCP is also paying close attention to the army reorganization work and is using a policy of breaking them up one by one, dispersing their strength, and resolving it smoothly. On the other hand, Li Jishen is using various means and personal relationships to connect with the commanders of each unit with emotions to avoid any unexpected changes. For example, Lin Weichou, the former commander of the 62nd Army and deputy commander of Tianjin's defense, was originally captured in Tianjin. Now, with Li Jishen's guarantee to the CCP, he has regained his freedom and is allowed to move freely within Beijing, but he cannot leave Beijing. According to news I heard on the way, Huang Xiang, the commander of the 92nd Army, was dismissed and detained by the CCP for being fond of dancing and considered not progressive enough, and his real estate was seized. Some troops are being transferred and isolated separately, so that their strength is dispersed and they cannot coordinate with each other. Therefore, they are taking whatever they want and destroying them one by one. It can be seen that the CCP is using very good tactics!</p>
<p>(7) The Situation is Getting Tighter and Tighter</p>
<p>Politics is something with exclusivity and control. The politics under the CCP's rule is especially tightly controlled! The CCP's party members and cadres are all special agents. They are watching you at all times and never let up. The CCP is an organizational body with only the party's resolutions and the group's will, and no personal feelings or relationships. Some people think that I have a good personal relationship with someone in the CCP, and maybe he can give me a break out of personal friendship. Some people think that I have never criticized the CCP, and he may show me some goodwill and not make things difficult for me. In fact, these are all wrong ideas. They simply do not understand the nature of the CCP! All their attitudes are based on the interests of the party. For example, before President Chiang Kai-shek retired, the CCP tried its best to attack Chiang. Everyone thought that as long as Chiang retired, the CCP would no longer attack him. As a result, Li Zongren became acting president, and the target of the attack shifted to Li. Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi are the people who have dealt with the CCP the most. Everyone regards them as envoys of peace, but the CCP's attacks on Zhang and Shao are the same and will be no exception. If you do not understand the nature of the CCP and decide on how to deal with the CCP, there will inevitably be great deviations and errors.</p>
<p>When local peace was first achieved in Beijing, everyone was so dissatisfied with the current political situation that they placed their hopes on the CCP's rule, thinking that the CCP would organize a coalition government in Beijing and that all political measures would be different from the situation in other places, and that perhaps everyone could participate in it. There are quite a few people living in Beijing who have this idea. At the same time, when the CCP first entered the city, they had no idea about anything. The takeover work was also very urgent and needed to be dealt with. For the time being, they could not take care of many political issues. All aspects showed a generous style in order to win people's hearts. However, as the takeover work gradually got on track and they understood the situation a little more, the political control gradually strengthened, and the situation became tighter and tighter. In the end, they could not escape their original set of practices.</p>
<p>At the celebration of the liberation of Beijing, Beijing Mayor Ye Jianying mentioned in his speech that in order to strengthen the task of military control in Beijing, he would arrest the war criminals who must be arrested and the key figures of the reactionaries. This is obviously in conflict with the original agreement to ensure the safety of the lives of public and religious personnel. Because Fu Zuoyi, the important "war criminal" who led them in the war, can still make amends for his crimes, are there still war criminals who must be arrested?! After hearing this passage from Ye Jianying, I knew that there must be something going on here. The facts of struggle and liquidation are slowly going to be implemented skillfully under various appearances.</p>
<p>As expected, the People's Daily published a large article containing accusations from the families of the students who died in the July 5th Incident, shouting that blood debts must be paid in blood and asking the government to punish Xu Huidong, the culprit of the July 5th Incident. After this accompanying prelude was played, Xu Huidong was arrested and detained a few days later. What will be the end of this article in the future? I don't know now, and there's no need to predict it either.</p>
<p>Then, Zhang Yinwu was arrested on the charge of being a bandit leader. The People's Daily published this news as a headline; the title was "Beijing Uncovers a Major Military Espionage Case, Bandit Leader Zhang Yinwu and Others Arrested." Several photos were also attached, and the situation was very serious!</p>
<p>Because I have a good personal relationship with Zhang Yinwu, I know the details of this case in more detail, and it's really too unjust! Last year, Beijing's middle schools, under the leadership of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, established winter camps. Si Cun Middle School also requested to be established as a brigade of the winter camp and requested some dilapidated guns from the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for training purposes. That's how the guns came. As for that radio, it was a Japanese-style military radio that could only communicate twenty or thirty miles away and was never used at all. Last summer, because Si Cun Middle School in Baoding was heavily in debt, Zhang asked me to try to sell it to the 208th Division in order to pay off the debt. Later, because the asking price was too high, it was not sold. But these guns and radios became Zhang Yinwu's ironclad evidence of reaction, isn't it unjust!</p>
<p>Why did the CCP arrest Zhang Yinwu? The main reason is that during the anti-Japanese period, Zhang served as the commander-in-chief of the Hebei Provincial People's Army, guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, did not cooperate with the CCP, and had conflicts. Because of this, the CCP hated him very much. Zhang is an honest and fair person with a very good reputation in Beijing and Hebei Province. He has a certain appeal. At the same time, some local armed forces in various counties also wanted to support him. The CCP has never allowed people who do not cooperate with them and have a way to exist. Since Zhang himself had some latent power and was in contact with Tong Shoushan and Ma Xiyuan in the Northeast, they had to arrest him and put the big hat of an espionage case on his head to prevent him from moving.</p>
<p>In short, the political nature of the Communist Party is a strong control. No matter what kind of appearance is used, it cannot escape this nature. The political situation in Beijing under the CCP's rule will of course only strengthen its control and the situation will become increasingly serious! Paying attention only to phenomena and ignoring the essence of the problem will cause you to have illusions and make mistakes in dealing with reality.</p>
<p>(8) Leaving Beijing and Passing Through the Liberated Areas</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation in Beijing was getting tighter and tighter, I decided that it was not a place to stay for long. I decided to leave Beijing immediately, regardless of the difficulties of the journey. At the same time, I also wanted to pass through the liberated areas and see their rule for myself.</p>
<p>On the morning of February 18, I began my journey from Beijing. The train ticket had been bought the day before. The train fare from Beijing to Tianjin was 96 yuan in People's Currency. There were no checks or interrogations along the way. Although the Pingjin Railway has been open for many days, the order on the train is very chaotic! Later, because the unlimited purchase of tickets was changed, it was only slightly better starting the day before, but many people still did not have seats. There are only third-class cars, no first or second class, which is a sign of equality. The train does not run very accurately. I waited for two trains along the way, each time for more than an hour. I was supposed to arrive in Tianjin at 2:00 PM, but it turned out to be after 4:00 PM that afternoon. There were no checks either.</p>
<p>On the 19th, I changed to a bus from Tianjin to Jinan. The fare was 1,500 yuan in People's Currency. When leaving Tianjin, you have to go through a check procedure. As long as there are no special circumstances, after being checked and given a lecture by the inspectors, you are allowed to get on the bus and leave. Passing through villages along the way, there are also two or three places where you have to stop for inspection, but it is not very strict. Most of them are released in accordance with the CCP's lenient policy. As long as you have a pass, you can say a lot less. Because Beijing had not issued a pass at that time, I did not have a pass. I only had a National Identity Card from Nanjing, so I had to say a few more words when questioned. The car we were riding in broke down after leaving Tianjin, so we had to wait for another car to continue our journey. We stayed overnight in Yixian that day. I got up at 5:00 AM the next morning, wanting to leave early and arrive in Dezhou that day. But passing by the bridge near Cangxian, there was a strict check. Because I did not have a pass and there were a few words crossed out on my identity card that did not match my personal seal, I was detained and not allowed to continue my journey. After negotiations, the bus ticket was refunded for 1,000 yuan in People's Currency. I and another person in the car were escorted to a certain place. This is a branch of the Public Security Bureau. The friend who came with me was released after being questioned, but I was detained here and not allowed to go back.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Shadow of Rice Panic in Taiwan <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Wu Shouren</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 11th] Since the beginning of February, Taiwan has encountered unprecedented disasters. The shadow of white terror, which has always only loomed over the hearts of people from the mainland, has been followed by hordes of high-ranking refugees, fiercely attacking this isolated island! When we open the February newspapers, we see that red-plate Penglai rice is selling for NT$160,000 per 100 Taiwanese catties. At that time, the exchange rate was 1:65, which should be equivalent to over 2,460 Gold Yuan. Adding the 20% difference in weight, that means one Shanghai dan of white rice would sell for 2,952 Gold Yuan in Taiwan. Looking back at Shanghai, the red plate is selling for 4,300 Gold Yuan. The above two figures tell us that the price of rice in Taiwan is one-third cheaper than in Shanghai. This ratio has never been broken by any force in the past century. This is because Taiwan is not only a rice-producing area but also a surplus area. In the statistics of food supply and demand, it has always maintained a large surplus! Even in the year 34, when food production fell sharply, although the production volume plummeted from 1,068,121 tons to 638,828 tons, it did not encounter any difficulties in the supply and demand within the province, except for the loss of a surplus income. The ratio of Shanghai rice prices still maintained the traditional record.</p>
<p>How long has it been since Taiwan's pride, maintained for nearly a century, has been completely destroyed by reality! Let's look at the rice markets in Taiwan and Shanghai on February 5:</p>
<p>Taiwan Penglai White Rice</p>
<p>NT$200,000 per 100 Taiwanese catties. According to the exchange rate of 1:35 that day, plus the 20% weight difference, it should be converted into 7,130 Gold Yuan per Shanghai dan. On the same day, the black market price in Shanghai was 7,000 Gold Yuan, and the government's selling price was 4,500 Gold Yuan. The newspaper has already published the news that "Mayor Wu was shocked and furious, his voice heard outside the room." From this day on, the rice prices in Taiwan and Shanghai not only evened out, but even surpassed each other. Taiwan took the lead and quickly climbed to the peak of the most expensive region in the country! We still remember that it was February 22, when the price was NT$330,000 per 100 Taiwanese catties. The exchange rate was 1:16. Adding the weight difference, each Shanghai dan would be converted into 24,744 Gold Yuan. The retail price of white japonica rice in Shanghai was 11,000 to 12,000 Gold Yuan. Buying one dan of rice in Taiwan could buy more than two dan in Shanghai. Compared to the situation twenty days ago when buying one dan in Shanghai could buy one dan and three dou in Taiwan, the difference is like heaven and earth! The speed of the rise and the intensity of the change in the angle of the price inversion are beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Fifty-two percent of Taiwan's 1.16 million households do not produce their own food. They are in the midst of this unprecedented rice price frenzy in Taiwan's history, as if falling from heaven to hell. The feelings of indignation and worry are indescribable.</p>
<p>The reporter does not want to deny the various efforts and measures made by the government in this serious situation. For example, expanding the sales area and household distribution, special distribution, etc. The government is sparing no effort to make a last-ditch effort with the actual goods in its possession. At the same time, it has also widely used political power to extensively investigate and squeeze the grain reserves of large households and grain merchants, and set a deadline for sale. We cannot but admit that the government has done its best in principle to suppress rice prices. However, looking at the effect, on the day the reporter wrote this (March 9), although the price of rice in Taiwan had fallen to NT$300,000 per 100 Taiwanese catties in terms of numbers, the Gold Yuan price converted to the market price was still about 40,000 yuan according to the exchange rate of 1:9. Compared to the market price of 29,500 yuan in Shanghai on the same day, it is still more than 40% more expensive. We cannot deny that the current situation is still unreasonable. At the very least, it must restore the ratio before February 1 in order to be considered normal! This is the unanimous demand of all the people of Taiwan and also a major test for the current provincial administration.</p>
<p>To restore the normal rice price in Taiwan, we must first understand what forces are destroying the rice price ratio that Taiwan has maintained for nearly a century and has become a tradition. The reporter has discussed this issue with many experts separately. Combining the opinions of the majority, it can be roughly summarized into four points: First, due to the rapid turn of events, a large number of people from the mainland, such as Pingjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, have been evacuated to Taiwan, resulting in a sharp increase in consumption. Second, due to the increase in population and consumption, the large households and grain merchants who control the grain are psychologically reluctant to sell their grain reserves, which affects the amount of grain circulating on the market. Third, the devaluation of the Taiwanese dollar itself. Fourth, due to the grain price fluctuations caused by the above three points, coupled with the precedent of the failure of the 819 price limit, people who do not have grain and high-ranking refugees who have been evacuated to Taiwan have lost confidence in the government's control of grain prices. Everyone has unanimously purchased grain for storage, so that the supply and demand problem has invisibly exceeded the budget and an imbalance has occurred, further promoting the trend of rising rice prices. From the above four points, we can draw a conclusion that the abnormal rise in rice prices in Taiwan today is entirely caused by man-made factors that are almost self-inflicted. How can this be seen? Let's look at the above four points. Except for the third point, the remaining three points should take the first point as the initial starting point. Without the first point, there would be no second and fourth points. Therefore, the reporter can provide several figures to illustrate this first point: The first thing we need to understand is how many people there are in Taiwan currently, including those evacuated from the mainland. According to the latest and most accurate statistics, the total population of Taiwan now is 6,799,196 people. According to the most standard and reasonable calculation, each person needs 144 kilograms of grain per year. The total annual need of this nearly 7 million population is 979,084.224 tons. Let's look at this year's grain harvest, which is estimated to be at least 1,068,421 tons. Then the production volume and consumption volume offset each other, leaving a surplus of 89,336.776 tons. The reporter dares to say with certainty that there are no other more accurate statistics; and no one can overthrow it with empty words. Therefore, from these figures, we can know that although everyone has intuitively felt that the population from the mainland has poured in like a tide in the past six months, it has not had an impact on the supply and demand of grain in Taiwan! It can be seen that the "sharp increase in consumption" mentioned in the first point cannot actually play any role! As for psychological stimulation, from a scientific point of view, it is untenable at all; from a political point of view, its existence cannot be recognized.</p>
<p>In modern economics, there is a generally accepted theory: that the price problem is the whole supply and demand problem; the grain price is one of the prices, and of course it cannot be separated from this category. However, the grain price in Taiwan has exceeded this category. What it relies on is nothing but a virtual and man-made psychological stimulation; this is definitely not an accurate theoretical basis. Therefore, in response to this perverse fact, political power is the best test! The reporter believes that there should be some technical revisions and supplements to the various measures currently being taken by the grain administration authorities: First, regarding household distribution and special distribution, according to the original method, the former is to distribute 10 catties every five days for three or more people per household based on the household registration certificate, and 10 catties every ten days for less than three people, at 70% of the market price. The latter is the same quantity as the former, but the price is increased to 90% of the market price. We feel that this measure is indeed very correct in principle; but in terms of quantity and price, there is a real need for improvement! In terms of quantity: the division of grades of quantity should be calculated meticulously, and it is best to take people as the unit, and make them get enough quantity that they do not have to buy it in the market. In terms of price, the distribution price should not follow the market price, but should lead the market price to make effective and reasonable reductions. The second is about ordering large households and grain merchants to sell their grain reserves within a limited time. We believe that this time limit should be changed to selling in installments and in quantities. For example, if the government limits a certain large household or a certain grain merchant to sell his grain reserves within half a month, it must stipulate how much he must sell every three days or every five days based on the amount of his grain reserves, and he must sell it all by the end of half a month. This can avoid delays by large households and grain merchants within the time limit, and it is also a help in suppressing grain prices.</p>
<p>When Mr. Chen Ci-hsiu first took over the provincial administration, he did not hesitate to devote his efforts to suppressing salt prices at a time when there were many things waiting to be done, and then promulgated the Taiwan Provincial Salt Price Parity Distribution Plan, which reduced salt prices by 40% at once. Why is this? Because he understood the importance of salt in human life. And rice certainly occupies more weight in human life history. Chen cannot say that he does not know that the current rice price exceeds the norm; only because we understand that his observation is meticulous, we believe that he must use thunderous force to restrain the rice price and restore it to normal. Therefore, in the past twenty days, when rice prices rose the most fiercely, the reporter did not engage in reports on how rampant and overbearing this white terror was in Taiwan; everyone was waiting with a heavy heart for Mr. Chen Ci-hsiu's effective countermeasures! However, a month has passed, and although rice prices have shown a slight downward trend, they are still far from normal. We believe that this is the best opportunity. The government should take this opportunity to devote all its efforts to guide rice prices back to the ratio before February 1; the people of the whole province are asking Chen to show the perseverance he had when suppressing salt prices! Because, if rice prices rekindle due to man-made factors, the situation will be even more uncontrollable. As the saying goes: "Things must rot from the inside before worms grow." Today's rice price problem is just beginning to rot and grow worms. If the government does not plan for this, it will be too late to regret it when the rot expands and the strength of the worms is cultivated.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Injured Soldiers Assault Shoppers: Zha Pu Shut Down for a Day <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Our Pinghu, 16th Dispatch] All the shops in Zha Pu, a town under the jurisdiction of this county, closed down for one day on the 15th and resumed business on the 16th. The incident occurred around 2 PM on the 14th, when two soldiers from the 98th Hospital went to the Hongyuan Fish Shop in Haitang and bought four and a half catties of jellyfish for 400 yuan. At that time, the market price was 300 yuan per catty, but the shop did not haggle, considering that the soldiers were injured for the sake of the country and the nation. Unexpectedly, the soldiers wanted to buy 100 catties of jellyfish, with payment to be made in Pinghu. The shop staff, acting as agents for the sale, had a misunderstanding in their words. Subsequently, they brutally beat up shop employee Fan Yingnai and apprentice Chen Dahai, causing serious injuries. This aroused resentment among the merchants and residents of the entire town, and they had no choice but to close down all the shops on the 15th. They sent representatives, including Ma Hanliang, Wang Shouyu, Guo Qiaoguan, and over ten others, to the county to petition. At that time, Yu Shuting, the Administrative Inspector of the First District of Zhejiang Province, was in the county for observation. He invited Lu, the director of the 98th Hospital, and others to discuss the matter at the County Council. Furthermore, six or seven hundred merchants and residents arrived in the town by land and water, demanding punishment for the soldiers who caused the trouble, a guarantee that similar incidents would not happen again, and compensation for the damaged furniture of the Hongyuan Shop. Director Lu, having only been in office for three days, was in the process of reorganizing the hospital affairs and expressed deep regret over the incident. He immediately comforted the petitioners and promised to personally visit Zha Pu on the 16th to offer condolences and accept all requests. A satisfactory outcome was reached, and he returned to Zha Pu that evening. Director Lu, together with Commissioner Yu and County Magistrate Lou, went to Zha Pu on the morning of the 16th, and the shops had already resumed business.</p>
<h3 id="e107">First Pacification Zone to Levy Temporary Fees <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang, 16th Dispatch] In the recent Pacification Conference held in Changzhou by the Headquarters of the First Pacification Zone, it was decided that all counties under its jurisdiction should levy temporary Pacification Zone fees to supply various military necessities. All counties will uniformly start levying the fees from April 1st. The Headquarters has already formulated detailed implementation rules and ordered all counties to comply. The main points are as follows: (A) Fundraising: (1) Legal persons and natural persons will be the target. The county magistrate will convene local legal entities to assess the assets, business volume, and income of local banks, factories, companies, firms, and wealthy households based on reasonable principles. They will then be graded and submitted to the tax collection office for separate registration and collection. (2) For special products, the tax rate will be limited to 20% to 30%. (3) Local tax rates will be adjusted, not exceeding the original standard in principle, but not less than half of the original tax rate. (B) Collection: (1) County tax collection offices will collect the fees once every three months based on the assessed grades. (2) Collection procedures will adopt a public treasury system, with the collection agency not directly receiving funds. (3) Revenue from adjusted local tax rates, the portion for the Pacification Zone's temporary fees, will be submitted to the designated public treasury for deposit. (4) The Pacification Zone's temporary fees collected from legal persons and natural persons should be based on silver dollars. If gold yuan are paid, they will be converted according to the government exchange rate. (C) Expenditure: (1) Withdrawals from the designated public treasury will be based on payment orders from the Pacification Zone Management Committee. (2) To cope with emergency needs, two-thirds of the collected amount may be retained by the County Management Committee as working capital. The District Management Committee will issue payment orders to the County Management Committee based on the County's weekly reports, for withdrawal from the County's public treasury. (3) The two-thirds retained by each county should be reviewed by the County Council on a monthly basis, with a list submitted to the District Management Committee for verification. The remaining one-third will be centrally allocated by the District Management Committee for adjustment purposes.</p>

<p>Is it a Qin or Han Tomb? Or a Wei or Jin Burial Mound? Heads of Various Agencies Will Continue Excavation</p>
<p>[Our Wujin, 15th Dispatch] Outside the Xiaonanmen, two or three miles from the city, near Yunjia Village is the Yunjia Mound, originally a high hill. Recently, city defense works were constructed near this area, and during excavation, an ancient tomb was suddenly discovered. Inside, there was a small underground chamber built with huge bricks. There were three arched doorways, resembling three grand residences, indicating a considerable scale. Broken pieces of a treasured sword and figurines of celestial boys and girls were found in the soil at the entrance. The bricks were all one foot and two inches long, and six inches wide, with patterns of Wuzhu coins carved on them. Currently, three tomb doors have not yet been opened, and the coffin has not been found. The news has spread throughout the city, and tens of thousands of people are vying to explore. The City Defense Department and the County Government have specially dispatched teams to protect the site. Today, Vice Pacification Commander Jiao has invited the heads of various agencies to jointly excavate and unravel this mystery.

<p>[Our Dispatch] Hai Ziwen, the 44-year-old section chief of the Third Section of the 14th Logistics Station of the 59th Army stationed in Yi, residing at No. 52 Mashanbu, originally had an adjutant, two children, and a servant. Recently, he was ordered to disperse. Hai left a certain adjutant to take his two children and luggage elsewhere. On the night of the 14th, the servant suddenly entered Hai's bedroom with a kitchen knife, and while Hai was asleep, violently slashed Hai's head more than ten times. Hai struggled briefly before collapsing in a pool of blood. The servant took a gold ring and valuables and fled. As he was dying, Hai suddenly woke up again and struggled to crawl out of the room, screaming for help. His roommates were startled and upon seeing the scene, were greatly alarmed. Hai haltingly explained that he had been attacked by the servant, who had taken the ring. He died shortly after. Emergency treatment was ineffective.</p>

<p>Poor Women in All Districts Where Collaborating Hospitals Are Located Can Apply</p>
<p>The "Readers' Maternity Assistance" movement, jointly organized by this newspaper and hospitals such as Renhe, Shangxian, Baoli, Huisheng, and the Red Cross Society, has been well-received by all parties over the past two years, thanks to the full cooperation of the responsible authorities, doctors, and nurses of each hospital. Although the addresses of these hospitals are distributed in various districts of this city, the Shanghai West area is uniquely lacking, which has caused some regret for the poor pregnant women there. In order to remedy this deficiency, this newspaper has obtained the consent of the authorities of Ren'ai Hospital (west end of Zhongshan Park) at No. 891 Changning Road, and will begin to join the collaboration from today. After that, all poor pregnant women residing in the Shanghai West area can apply to stay in the hospital to give birth. The application method is the same as for the previous hospitals, i.e., first come to this newspaper for an interview to obtain an application form, fill it out according to the format, and then send it to this newspaper for review. Once approved, you can go to the designated collaborating hospital to give birth. Ren'ai Hospital is managed by Dr. Lu Kunhao, with spacious facilities and complete equipment. This participation in maternity assistance cooperation is truly a great boon for the readers of this newspaper.</p>

<p>Your letter has been approved. After investigation, it was found that the driver who caused the accident, Li Shifu, belonged to the 14th Truck Regiment. After the accident, his colleague Mei Changyi was asked to go to the police station of the North Railway Station Branch to inquire. At that time, he also paid 45 yuan for the injured person's medical expenses, and then successively paid 50 yuan and 100 yuan, totaling 195 yuan, before stopping. However, the medical expenses are still quite large. Now that the injured person has recovered, the hospital needs to recover the medical expenses, but the injured person has no money to pay, hence this action. After Yu Shide was injured, the criminal part of the case against the driver who caused the accident has already been withdrawn and not pursued. Furthermore, the driver has paid three times for the medical expenses. Now it only involves the civil part." Correspondingly, please note for your reference!</p>

<h3 id="e114">Writer Xiao Jun Gets a Cold Shoulder: An Exposure of "Freedom of Speech in the News" <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper Zheng Zhiang</p>
<p>[Our Hong Kong, 14th Dispatch] In the "Liberated Areas," all soldiers, members of the bourgeoisie, and intellectuals are liable to be purged and struggled against. This is a fact that everyone clearly recognizes. Not only that, but even so-called "fellow travelers" are ruthlessly attacked. Recently, a wave of purging has risen again in the Northeast and Hong Kong regarding the literary writer Xiao Jun (also known as Tian Jun). Cultural figures everywhere are eager to know the inside story of the purge. Therefore, the reporter is willing to use the space of this newspaper's correspondence section to give readers a detailed report.</p>
<p>First, let's explain what kind of writer Xiao Jun is. He is one of the so-called "Northeast writers" in the ranks of the leftist writers. He has written many short and long stories, of which "Village in August" is the most famous. And his rise to fame should be attributed to Lu Xun, because at that time, "Village in August" had not been recognized by the literary world, nor could it find a publishing opportunity. Xiao Jun, being sensitive, immediately consulted Lu Xun, hoping to gain the favor of publishers through his publicity. As a result, Lu Xun agreed to him, wrote a flattering preface to his "Village in August," and compiled it into the "Slave Series," appearing in a brand new posture. Once the book was published, the literary world followed suit with enthusiastic praise, and Xiao Jun's status as a famous writer was solidified from then on.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Xiao Jun evacuated from Shanghai to Chongqing, and then transferred from Chongqing to Yan'an. Last year, he went to Harbin and published a weekly called "Cultural News." In the "Cultural News" published on the day of the "August 15th" celebration of the surrender of the Japanese invaders in the Northeast, he harbored a deep sense of awareness and saw more clearly than others what the Soviet Union had done in the Northeast. Therefore, he took up his huge writing brush and indirectly stated that the Soviet Union was a red imperialist. This cry greatly angered the authorities in the Northeast Liberated Area, who believed that since Xiao Jun had come to the Liberated Area, he should not say such "strange things." Since he had said "strange things," it proved that he was in league with the "anti-Soviet, anti-communist Kuomintang reactionaries." They had to teach him a lesson, especially by encircling and suppressing him, believing that only by doing so could Xiao Jun be corrected and, at the same time, give the masses an opportunity for public education. Their central idea was nothing more than a formulaic theory, saying: "We know that only the anti-Soviet, anti-communist Kuomintang reactionaries deceitfully say that imperialism has 'red' and 'white' colors, and falsely accuse the Soviet Union of being 'red imperialism.'"</p>
<p>This is another way of expressing the same theory. They said in unison: "Why don't you, Xiao Jun, make any flattering expressions to the Soviet Red Army? The Soviet Red Army is the only foreign army that helps the People's Liberation Army! Not only do you not flatter it, but you also satirize it. What is your purpose?"</p>
<p>On the same day, Xiao Jun published an article in "Cultural News" writing about several Chinese children watching Russians drink tea in front of a Russian's house. The Russians didn't let them watch and wanted to drive them away. So, "It is impolite not to reciprocate," the Chinese children threw a stone in and hit the Russian old woman, who screamed incessantly.</p>
<p>In essence, this sketch shows the tenacious resistance of Chinese children, but the "comrades" in the "Liberated Area" believe that "this is a vicious piece of literature that provokes hatred between the Chinese and Soviet nations!" Just imagine: Chinese children have become champions of "provoking hatred between the Chinese and Soviet nations." Isn't that strange enough?</p>
<p>Xiao Jun is a writer with a national conscience, as can be seen from another essay, "Remembering the Past and Present." "Remembering the Past and Present" was also published in the same day's "Cultural News." The full text includes two sets of old-style poems, with a short preface explaining that this round of the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is a war of brothers fighting within the walls, therefore, he believes that "it is impossible not to be saddened by the fratricide!" The original text of Xiao Jun is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"I know that the blood of the Chinese people will continue to flow in large quantities, but remembering the past and present, it is impossible to avoid feeling sad! It is impossible not to be saddened by the fratricide!"</p>
<p>In the "Preface" to "Feeling After Hearing of Victory," Xiao Jun said:</p>
<p>"The initial transmission of the news of victory was like a dream, as if sad and happy, as if fearful and worried, with all emotions intertwined, making it difficult to laugh or cry. Tracing back to the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, how much blood of the people's heroes was spent to obtain this 'initial fruit.' It is a pity that the enemy's atmosphere is not yet fully quelled, and the fratricide is boiling! Looking to the past and looking to the future, how can one not be worried and fearful!"</p>
<p>Xiao Jun has always maintained the same attitude. He is unwilling to blindly follow the Communist Party and regard the fratricide as a "war of the people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism." Instead, he regards the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as a pair of "brothers from the same root." Therefore, Xiao Jun was not delighted when he heard the news of the "Liberation Army's" victory, but could not help but feel sad, fearful, and even moved to tears. This is an honest expression of the writer's true attitude, but the "comrades" around him falsely accused him of "posing, with a hypocritical humanitarian face, completely beneficial to the enemy and harmful to the people's liberation cause."</p>
<p>The "Life News," hosted by Song Zhi of and several other writers, became the slaughterhouse for encircling and suppressing Xiao Jun. They resolutely wanted Xiao Jun to study hard and transform himself. This struggle lasted for more than two months, but Xiao Jun always insisted on his position and did not yield. Therefore, all kinds of labels such as "extreme individualist," "Trotskyist," "anti-Soviet, anti-people" were added to Xiao Jun's head. They unanimously attacked: Xiao Jun has a sense of superiority as a writer, and he is dissatisfied, so he complains and says strange things. In fact, as we see it, Xiao Jun holds a consistent and honest attitude and opposes any pretense and labels!</p>

<h3 id="e115">National Bank Restricts Withdrawal of Next-Day Deposits by Banks and Firms: Unprecedented Shortage of Cash in the Market, Discount Reaches as High as 10% to 15% <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the cyclical rise in prices, the supply of cash has been insufficient for a week. Yesterday, the supply of cash from the Central Bank was limited, and the cash shortage in the market was unprecedented. The discount on bills of exchange has reached as high as 10% to 15%. For the past two days, the counter and back office of the cashier department of the Central Bank have been crowded with personnel from various banks and firms negotiating the withdrawal of cash. Even as late as 8 or 9 p.m., the congestion had not subsided slightly. The banking and money industry in this city believed that since various banks and firms had surplus funds deposited in the National Bank for next-day withdrawal, there should be no restrictions. Therefore, representatives were sent to the National Bank for negotiations a few days ago. As a result, the National Bank has agreed that if banks and firms have surplus funds deposited in the National Bank for the next day, each bank will be limited to withdrawing 2 million yuan in cash per day. However, yesterday, due to the shortage of cash reserves in the National Bank and the unrestricted demand caused by the soaring prices, the cash withdrawal limit was changed again, stipulating that for every one million yuan in surplus funds deposited by banks and firms for the next day, they can withdraw 100,000 yuan in cash. With the issuance of this restriction, the cash supply of various banks and firms was suddenly reduced. It is said that even large banks such as the Bank of Communications only received 500,000 yuan yesterday. Therefore, the payment to customers by various banks and firms was also greatly restricted, resulting in an unprecedented shortage of cash turnover in the market. Those in urgent need of cash did not hesitate to discount their bills at high prices, resulting in an unprecedentedly high discount rate after the issuance of the gold yuan.</p>
<p>According to analysis by various related parties, the reasons for the cash crunch are nothing more than the following: (1) The trend of cyclical price increases has already exceeded the cash production rate of the printing press. Especially after the cyclical rise in prices, the amount of cash in circulation is even more insufficient. (2) The National Bank's Issuing Bureau prioritizes the supply of military pay and allowances. This huge amount of military pay must be regularly transported to various places in large amounts of cash for distribution. (3) These days are the period for various industries to pay salaries in the middle of the month, and the need for cash is extremely urgent. (4) The exchange rate difference in various parts of South China is close to half, while the cash discount in various parts of Southwest China, such as Chengdu and Chongqing, is surprisingly high. Cash in this city is constantly being collected and transported out for arbitrage. Due to these factors, the cash crunch is becoming increasingly acute.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Easy Money, Tight Cash: Large Denomination Notes Flowing Outward <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the money market was flooded all day long. The National Treasury had a huge amount of disbursements, foreign exchange remittances were constantly arriving, and the National Bank did not sell cotton yarn this week. The amount of gold allocated was also limited, so there was no hope of tightening the money supply. The daily interest rate has hovered between 60 and 65 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the surplus of the National Bank and its branches was over 1.44 billion yuan, the surplus of foreign banks was over 1.04 billion yuan, the net inflow of large exchanges was over 1.21 billion yuan, and the net inflow of small exchanges was over 1.27 billion yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, a related official from the National Bank told reporters: The bank's issuance of banknotes has been handled as usual these days, without any changes. In addition to the factors of military disbursements and cyclical salary payments, the shortage of cash in the market may also be due to artificial arbitrage and transportation to other places for profit. He cited an example to illustrate this, saying that the National Bank has issued several billion yuan of thousand-yuan notes in this city, but none have been seen circulating in the market, which shows that people must be taking them out for arbitrage. However, he believes that the current cash crunch is helpful in stabilizing prices.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Gold Prices Rising Steadily <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Gold prices continued to rise yesterday, both in the morning and afternoon, and the market sentiment was excellent. There was loose money in the market, and dealers were extremely flush with funds. New players were active, and the trend climbed to new peaks. However, most people were still concerned, and the price would pull back after rising, but then rise again after pulling back. The market is still taking a steady upward trend. The morning opening continued the bullish sentiment from the previous night, and people were quite confident. The initial opening was as high as 425 to 430. After opening, it rose to 427 to 430. After the high, sellers who had floated orders overnight sold, and the market immediately softened, with the low at 422 to 425. After the low, people continued to see new highs, and aggressive buying was frequent on the trading floor, pushing the price back up to 427 to 430. After rising, selling pressure started again, continuing down slightly to 423 to 426. The market then hovered between 425 and 428. After 11 o'clock, it broke through the 430 barrier, reaching 432 to 435. However, the bulls did not dare to speculate openly, still wary of the Central Bank's selling. Near noon, it reached as high as 435 to 438, with the highest reaching 436 to 439, then dropping slightly again to 431 to 434. It finally closed at 432 to 435 at noon. The outside market was as high as 437 to 440. In the afternoon, market sentiment became even more bullish. Contrary to expectations, the Central Bank did not take any action in the morning session. It was also heard that the jewelry stores' allocation price was 430,000, which also increased with the market, and people became more bullish. The initial opening was 468 to 471, and then rose to 475 to 478. After the high, it once pulled back slightly to 471 to 474. Finally, it still rose to 473 to 476, closing at 481 to 484 in the evening, with a very strong upward trend.</p>
<p>The morning opening for U.S. dollars was 8,500 yuan to 8,600 yuan, based on the trend of gold. The afternoon closing in the morning session was 8,650 yuan to 8,700 yuan. The opening in the afternoon session was 9,370 yuan to 9,420 yuan, and the evening closing was 9,620 yuan to 9,670 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e119">National Bank Continues to Allocate Original Gold <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The National Bank continued to allocate original gold to the jewelry industry yesterday. However, the application time in the morning was extended to 12 noon. The applications from various jewelry stores reached approximately 1,000 taels. The National Bank's opening price was 430,000 yuan per tael, and all applications were allocated, with a deadline for settlement and clearance by 1 pm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the person in charge of the National Bank's Business Bureau told reporters yesterday that the National Bank had continued to sell original gold to the jewelry industry and had also sold approximately 10,000 taels secretly in the market. However, when asked of the members of the gold industry, they could not confirm this. They all said that small-scale sales by the National Bank might have occurred yesterday, but they had not heard of any sales reaching 10,000 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Silk Prices Rise Again <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the upward trend in the raw silk market continued strongly. The price of gold outside the industry repeatedly reached new peaks. Credit within the industry was loose and abundant, and interest rates offered by floating individual investors were not very attractive, leading to increased demand for raw silk.</p>
<p>In the morning, at the No. 120 Tianqiao (overpass), due to excessive liquidity, brokers supported the market and quoted 2.1 million for spot goods, opening at a high price. After the opening, news arrived that gold prices had fallen from 430 to 425, causing market sentiment to weaken and demand to decrease. Brokers were also hesitant to support the market, and the price gradually decreased to 2.05 million. The market ultimately closed at 2.065 million yuan, with the overnight position at 2.195 million yuan. It is expected that the market will remain strong due to favorable gold prices, but weak sales may cause the market to rise only slightly.</p>
<p>Raw silk foreign exchange certificates continued to rise, and the market was brisk. Credit in the market was extremely loose, and interest rates were low. Brokers, seeing that the cost of holding goods was not as high as in previous days, were less inclined to sell. Premium silk opened at 2.9 million yuan, once reaching a high of 3.05 million, and closed at 3.07 million. In the afternoon, prices were quoted slightly higher, but no official transactions were made.</p>
<p>In the morning, due to the abundance of liquidity, the prices of silk fabrics opened high across the board. New Asia quoted 1,485,000 yuan, and Dazheng quoted 1.48 million. After the quotations, demand was strong, and the market gradually rose, once reaching 1,505,000 yuan and 1.51 million. However, due to the sharp drop in Chinese stocks and news that the cotton cloth market was mediocre, prices slightly decreased. The market closed at 1.49 million and 1,485,000 yuan in the afternoon. No quotations were heard in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Shift of Idle Funds within the Industry, Weak Performance of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Chinese stock market was very weak yesterday. Pressure from outside the industry has eased, and idle funds within the industry have shifted to other sectors. The entire market process was quite bleak. The peak of each stock was fleeting, and large amounts of money were moved out by firms and bureaus, changing credit from loose to excessive. However, due to poor market sentiment, short positions were more numerous than long positions, and the market continued to show weakness. In the morning, Yongsheng Yarn rose because of extremely abundant liquidity and a sharp drop in overnight interest rates. The market had an average daily interest rate of 60 yuan, and many floating short positions were eager to buy, pushing the market up. The market opened at 6.8 yuan, and brokers strongly supported it, covering overnight short positions and pushing the market up to 7.02 yuan. However, banks and gold firms aggressively sold, causing the price to fall to 6.88 yuan. After the fall, retail investors bought again, pushing the price up to 6.96 yuan. Securities firms switched from long to short positions, constantly applying selling pressure, and the price quickly declined, hovering around 6.58 and 6.61 yuan. Afterwards, credit changed from loose to excessive, and the gold market continued to rise, causing brokers to shift their focus, selling stocks and buying gold. The stock market suffered a complete collapse, closing in the afternoon at a low of 6.41 yuan.</p>
<p>The performance of small and medium-sized stocks was still stable in the morning, and retail investors continued to buy, causing each stock to open at a high price. However, due to pressure on Yongsheng Yarn, the market ultimately weakened. Meiya opened at 2.1 yuan, close to the limit. Xinguang secretly supported the market repeatedly, and the trend was initially high but later weak. Xinhe, Jingfu, and Qinxing opened relatively flat in the morning, but all fell back in the afternoon. The remaining stocks were initially flat but later softened. The total daily transaction volume was 4,658 million shares.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks and Gold Prices Rise</p>
<p>Foreign stocks rose yesterday due to the shift of foreign exchange to the securities market and abundant credit in the market. Many industries had numerous long positions, and there were reports of large outflows on the same day, leading to high market sentiment and increased demand. Each stock rose significantly. Jardine Matheson traded at 47,000 yuan and 49,000 yuan, an increase of 20%. Ewo Silk traded at 13,100 yuan and 13,300 yuan, also an increase of 500 yuan. Other stocks rose across the board.</p>
<p>The official price of gold rose, demand in the market increased, and the price of gold outside the industry soared. Market sentiment was high, and the abundance of credit further boosted demand. The market opened at 223,000 yuan, once reaching a high of 237,600 yuan. After the high, there were reports of slightly lower gold prices, causing the market to fall slightly to 223,000 yuan. The market closed in the afternoon at 237,600 yuan, reaching the limit.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Rice Prices Soar, Special Japonica Rice at 46,000 Yuan <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Due to loose credit, rice prices continued to rise. Market sentiment was very strong at the opening, and prices were raised by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. However, rice shops were not eager to buy, and sales were sluggish. Prices gradually fell back in the middle of the day. In the northern market, white rice was 44,000 yuan, up 2,500 yuan, and thin rice was up 2,000 yuan, also at 44,000 yuan. In the southern market, white rice and early thin rice each rose by 1,500 to 2,000 yuan. Sheep indica rice was 44,000 yuan, and high-quality white rice was scarce, with prices opening at 47,500 yuan. Special japonica rice in the northern market reached 46,000 yuan. The total amount of rice arriving in the two markets yesterday was 6,070 shi.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Prices rose without end. Due to loose credit, rice prices rose first, and market sentiment was strong. Sellers raised prices, and each type of oil rose by 10,000 yuan at the opening. Later, retail investors actively bought, and prices rose again. Rapeseed oil opened at 166,000 yuan and later rose to 170,000 yuan. Soybean oil closed at 175,000 yuan, each rising by 15,000 yuan, or about 10%. A barrel of refined rapeseed oil broke the 200,000 yuan mark, reaching 215,000 yuan, an increase of 20,000 yuan. Sesame oil in small carts rose by 10,000 yuan, and soybean cake rose in tandem by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market remained strong. At the opening, with the support of loose credit, old brands continued to rise by 1,000 yuan, and the "warship" brand once closely approached the 18,000 yuan mark. Later, rumors persisted, and northern dealers maintained a wait-and-see attitude. The stock market rose sharply and then plummeted, causing market sentiment to be uneasy. Prices weakened across the board at the close. After the close, gold prices remained high, and market sentiment was quite strong. Dealers strongly supported the market, and the market showed strength again. Old brands quoted 18,400 yuan, and the "warship" brand traded at 17,680 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Prices rose and fell unevenly. Yellow soybeans generally rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Bean sauce and liquor dealers had demand, and oil factories also had an appetite. Vehicle soybeans traded at a high of 35,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had more supply than demand, and prices fell by 5,000 yuan. Sesame and corn had good sales in the local market, and prices rose. Mung beans were viewed with caution by Qinggang, and the market turned flat. Red beans had sluggish sales and were slightly downstream.</p>

<p>The trend in cotton yarn prices did not deviate from a stable pattern, and the range of price fluctuations was very narrow. With no external positive or negative stimulus, speculators had no intention of entering or leaving the market. Sales in the local market and by Guangdong dealers were not sluggish, but there were also many retail sellers, resulting in a balanced supply and demand in the market.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix opened outside the 3 million yuan mark. Many retail investors sold at high prices, and the price fell back to 2.95 million yuan at the close, a rise of 120,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 170,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon gradually fell from 1.96 million yuan to 1.93 million yuan at the close, a final rise of 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 1.55 million yuan. The price was once raised to 1.57 million yuan, but later fell back to 1.555 million yuan at the afternoon close, a rise of 110,000 yuan. Factory orders ultimately leveled with spot goods, and 20-count Double Horse rose by 90,000 yuan. Other brands, such as Golden City and Heavenly Maiden, also rose by 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. All grades of 16-count and below were brisk.</p>
<p>The cloth market continued to reach new highs, the market was very stable, and market sentiment remained firm. Sellers were unwilling to sell at these low prices, so prices rose at the opening. However, buyer's from other regions were cautious and did not step forward, so there were not many transactions.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth gradually rose from 64,000 yuan to 66,000 yuan, and closed at 65,000 yuan in the afternoon, a final rise of 6,000 yuan. Labatong fine cloth was 59,500 yuan, a rise of 5,500 yuan. In addition, Da Shuanglong and Longtou B fine cloth both rose by about 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sijunzi yuan bi ji opened at 62,400 yuan and was immediately sold downstream, falling to a low of 60,900 yuan. The market improved again near noon, and closed at 61,900 yuan, a rise of 5,500 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu yuan bi ji rose to 47,000 yuan. Prices for 190 shilin and poplin fabrics from factories were all increased by more than 10%. The trend was even stronger in the afternoon. It was reported that Longtou fine cloth was quoted at 70,000 yuan and Sijunzi yuan bi ji at 66,000 yuan outside the market.</p>

<p>The Scarcity of Cash Creates a Path to Wealth,</p>
<p>A Storm Brewing Can End Lives,</p>
<p>The Gold Market is Makeshift,</p>
<p>A Tempest Looms for the Rice and Grain Industry.</p>
<p>Treading through various markets, every market is soaring.</p>
<p>Ordinary people are speechless in the face of soaring prices, but those in the industry are still shaking their heads and sighing, feeling that even the interest has not risen.</p>
<p>Recently, one often hears of the bad news of "collapses." Yesterday, what department store, what rubber factory, what cigarette shop, what what, all had news of collapses. Upon detailed inquiry, every one was dragged down by high interest rates.</p>
<p>High interest rates: causing ordinary people to be speechless, causing industry and commerce to collapse; causing harm in this way, yet the financial authorities are congratulating themselves on their accomplishment!</p>
<p>Every industry is experiencing a scarcity of cash, some say due to credit inflation, others say due to excessive price increases. Because both exist simultaneously, the situation becomes increasingly severe.</p>
<p>The need for large banknotes is again a unanimous request.</p>
<p>The financial authorities who "respect public opinion" will soon show it in fact.</p>
<p>This cash scarcity is truly harming the working class, because salaries are mostly paid by check, and it is also harming the city's residents, because one cannot buy vegetables every day without cash.</p>
<p>The greater the harm, the more it creates huge profits for certain individuals. Currently, a one million yuan check can only be converted into 880,000 yuan in cash, truly a hard blow!</p>
<p>Those who control cash are the special individuals who monopolize the huge profits from cash. For these people, it can truly be said that there is a path to wealth.</p>
<p>For various reasons, the gold and silver market must be opened. For example, right now, it is not easy to knock in large quantities of silver dollars.</p>
<p>Again, for various reasons, restoring the gold exchange market is as difficult as climbing to the heavens. For example, paying margin is difficult for merchants; not paying is difficult for the authorities.</p>
<p>For these and other reasons, a makeshift tea party-style gold and silver market has emerged.</p>
<p>Currently, it is already in a period of official-merchant consultation and active preparation.</p>
<p>Will the preparatory work have an impact on the gold and silver market? My answer is, of course, there will be, and it will be many, great, and important.</p>
<p>For example, if I have membership qualifications, I will of course stir up my spirits and work hard at it after the market opens. Then I must have some gold and silver in hand, so there is a need to drag in a little more as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Because I think this way, other members think this way as well. Since people share the same mind and reason, gold and silver are of course viewed favorably at the moment.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, many pieces of news detrimental to the people's food have emerged, such as the Philippines borrowing rice from China, which the authorities have already agreed to; the city's rice rationing can barely be maintained until the end of June, without interruption.</p>
<p>Those involved in these news events are all active at the same time, giving people a signal that a great storm is coming to the rice market.</p>
<p>Damn, the common people are truly doomed!</p>

<h3 id="e128">Hua Lian Dominates, Hui Li Plays the Pipa, 64 to 34 With No Chance to Bargain <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In last night's basketball league, the Tai City champion Hua Lian defeated Hui Li by a score of 64 to 34, continuing its leading position in the league. At halftime, Hui Li trailed 24 to 18. Hua Lian led throughout, and Hui Li struggled under heavy pressure. Because last night's Encars vs. McInnes game was rescheduled, the first game started at 6:30 p.m., with the Kang team winning a big victory over the West Qing Lan team, 56 to 29, with Kang leading by four points at halftime, 20 to 16. The gymnasium was quite lively last night, with over two thousand fans, all supporters of both sides.</p>
<p>Hua Lian's star player, Wu Chengzhang, did not play last night because he had some "small relationship" with Hui Li and was also a coach for Hui Li. Initially, both sides were flustered, "playing the pipa and blocking each other," with Hui Li in a particularly miserable state, only managing to score nine points from free throws. However, after ten minutes, the situation completely changed, and the two teams were once in a stalemate. This stalemate did not last long, and Hua Lian's frenzied attacks led to a score difference of one to two at halftime. After the break, Hui Li took on the posture of a trapped beast, knowing that the overall situation was lost but continuing to work hard. Hua Lian worked hard last night, denying Hui Li any opportunity to avenge their defeat in the second round. Hui Li's Fu Haitang, Yongfang, and others struggled throughout, Cao Zhiji had bad luck with the ball, and although Wei Qikun did not score, he saved many dangerous balls under the basket in the first half.</p>
<p>The five players for Hui Li were Wang Yongfang, Cao Zhiji, Tian Fuhai, Ye Yunshan, and Wei Qikun. The players who took the court for Hua Lian were Chuan Jinsheng, Liu Fushan, Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, and Zhang Liangxiong. Hua Lian's A Chuan's initial attacks were ineffective, and later Bao and Fu each made a free throw, making it 2 to 0. Hui Li then paused. Bao scored another point, and Hui Li's Wang Yongfang gritted his teeth and shot, and the scoreboard also showed two points. This could be called the "era of double panic," with Hua Lian's free throws and Hui Li's under-the-basket shots all "playing the pipa." It was not easy for Bao and Zhang to add two points, making it 5 to 2. Xu Shuyuan replaced Wei, and within eight minutes, Hui Li's Wang Ye scored two free throws again, making it 7 to 4.</p>
<p>Hui Li, with Wang Yongfang's performance, changed the situation in an instant, overtaking with a score of 8 to 7. Hua Lian's Jia Zhou replaced Liangxiong, and Jin Sheng's one point made it 8 all. Hui Li's Xu Shuyuan was leading by one point, but Hua Lian's soldiers used their lives, launching strange balls repeatedly, making it 15 to 11. Hui Li's Wei and Xu returned to their original positions, but soon it was 17 to 11. From then on, it was all Hua Lian's world, and the balls went in one by one, making it 28 to 14 at halftime.</p>
<p>In the second half, Hui Li's Fu Hai and Yunshan seemed to echo each other, but Songyuan's "light touches" made it difficult for Hui Li to stand out. With the score at 45 to 28, Liangxiong replaced Zhenzhong, and Xiaole also performed well, making it 48 to 30. Li Hanting replaced Fu Jinsheng, and Yongfang and Fuhai were still fighting like trapped beasts. At 50 to 34, Fuhai committed his fifth foul, and Chen Zhengmiao entered the battle. Soon after, Shuyuan replaced Yunshan, and Hui Li finally entered a state of "everyone fighting for themselves." Hua Lian ultimately won a great victory by 64 to 34.</p>

<p>In the second division A match between West Qing Lan and Kang Team, the score was 20 to 16 at halftime. The West Qing Lan team's players had gold, brown, gray, and black hair, a riot of colors that showed that they were an international mixed team. In the second half, the small Russian's internal defense was too empty. Constantly changing the line did not have the effect. Kang Team ultimately won by a score of 56 to 29.</p>

<p>— By Qi Gongshu</p>
<p>Method B is used to defend against the opponent's special offensive tactics. The opponent's center is a tall and cumbersome player who stands under the basket like a high pillar. To deal with this method, the center back must select a tall and long-legged player to serve as the defender, controlling a small area under the basket. At the same time, the defender must intercept the opponent's passes and watch over the opponent's center who plays the role of the "pillar." Her task is extremely heavy. In addition to the above duties, she must also pay attention to the dynamics of another area. If the opponent's forward breaks through another area and rushes towards the basket, the center back should intercept the enemy forward within a possible range and be able to take the lead to slow down the forward's advance and prevent her from shooting and passing the ball to the center.</p>
<p>The previous two zone defense systems, which involve movement in zones, are shaped by the opponent's forward's movements. Now, we are studying how to determine the zone that should be defended based on the ball's location. It is possible to designate the zone that should be defended, and each guard still needs to be agile, have a tacit understanding of contact with the other two guards, and have the alertness to adapt to circumstances. Below are four simple basic moving zone defense methods that are relatively easy to learn and use. This moving zone defense zone is established based on the following principles: the area in which the defender stands strategically is close to the basket, and all scoring areas are under the guard's supervision. This defense system is divided into three lines of defense. If an attacker can break through the first line of defense, she still needs to continue to break through the second line of defense before she can rush to the basket, because when the attacker breaks through the front first line of defense, the guards on the rear two lines will immediately intercept her.</p>
<p>When taking defense, although it may be designated to defend the zone should not be a dull fixed, the zone is to see the movement of the ball in the movement of its formation.</p>
<p>Defensive guards each stand in strategically important areas, as mentioned above. When the opponent's center receives the ball in the center circle and launches an offensive, the three guards should be positioned in a triangular formation, with the center back standing in front of the free throw line and the left and right backs watching over the opponent's two forwards in front of the apex.</p>
<p>Figure 1: The imaginary point of the ball field slows down the area where separate guards attack and intercept the ball. If the opponent's center launches an offensive in China and passes the ball to her left or right forward, when the ball reaches that area, the guard in that area will come out to meet the enemy forward, watching over her until she has passed the ball to someone else. Each guard does not need to care about the movements of other enemy forwards, as long as she sees the ball in the forward's hand, she must come forward to watch over her. (To be continued 3)</p>
<h3 id="e131">SPORTS WORLD: Hong Kong Island Lawn Tennis Singles - Chinese Players Dominate the Quarterfinals - Hsu Wei-pei and Yeh Kuan-hsiung Win Easily - Hsu Run-pei and Liang Chih-chi Perform Excellently <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Airmail News] The tennis tournament organized by the Hong Kong Cricket Club saw lively scenes on the 16th, as fans flocked to watch the final players in the singles competition vie for a place in the semifinals. All four courts were packed with spectators. In the end, Yeh Kuan-hsiung, Hsu Run-pei, Liang Chih-chi, and Hsu Wei-pei secured their spots in the semifinals. In the upcoming matches to determine the finalists, Yeh Kuan-hsiung will face Hsu Run-pei, and Liang Chih-chi will compete against Hsu Wei-pei.</p>
<p>These four matches, even at the quarterfinal stage, were unexpectedly uneventful. The competition began at 5:15 PM and concluded with the last match (Chih-chi vs. Sikland) at only 5:55 PM. In other words, the longest match lasted only forty minutes. The match results are as follows:</p>
<p>Court 1: Yeh Kuan-hsiung vs. Tsai Yung-shan. This match was expected to be a battle. Yeh played with exceptional vigor yesterday, consistently taking the initiative with long shots followed by short drop shots, exhausting Tsai. With such a performance, Yeh can undoubtedly capture the championship in this tournament.</p>
<p>The match consisted of two sets. In the first set, Yeh started by winning the first five games. Tsai then managed to win one game, making the score 1-5. Yeh then won the first set 6-1. In the second set, Yeh continued smoothly, winning 6-2.</p>
<p>Court 2: Liang Chih-chi vs. Sikland. Before the match, I noted that while Liang and Sikland's playing styles were somewhat similar, Liang consistently had accurate shots and powerful "cuts," while Sikland relied solely on hard hitting. Therefore, Liang had a slight advantage in terms of winning. Indeed, Liang defeated Sikland yesterday with scores of 6-2, 6-2. Such a significant margin of victory is undoubtedly a success for Liang.</p>
<p>Court 3: Li Wen-cheng vs. Hsu Wei-pei. Li's skills were not yet refined, allowing Hsu to maintain control of the match's outcome. In the first set, Hsu secured a clean sweep with a score of 6-0. In the second set, Li briefly took the lead at 2-1, but then faltered, allowing Hsu to win six consecutive games and ultimately lose the second set with a score of 2-6, resulting in his elimination.</p>
<p>Court 4: Run-pei vs. Ho-tang. Ho-tang managed to put up a fight in the first set, but in the second set, it was a one-sided affair. In the two sets, Run-pei narrowly won the first set 6-4, and then won the second set 6-2. Winning decisively.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Hong Kong Football Association Selects Squad for Interport Match Against the Philippines <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Airmail News] At 5:15 PM on the 16th, the Interport Match Subcommittee of the Hong Kong Football Association convened a meeting to select players for the upcoming Hong Kong-Philippines interport football match in Manila next month. The meeting was chaired by MacAlister Paiwo, and attendees included Huang Chia-chun, Li Han-kan, Captain Cheeseman, Auma, Kingkin, Keller, Honorary Secretary Su Kuo-hsing, Deputy Secretary Hsia Hsien, etc. The reason for selecting the squad so early is twofold: firstly, to ascertain how many of those selected are willing to travel with the team, and secondly, to address the potential delays in obtaining passports for the Chinese players, as the previous direct approach to the diplomatic commissioner in Hong Kong and Guangdong is no longer straightforward. Therefore, it is necessary to finalize the list early to avoid last-minute complications. Consequently, the selection not only includes more reserve players, but also divides them into special reserve players and reserve players. In other words, if a first-choice player is unable to travel, a special reserve player will be substituted first. Even if all the first-choice players are willing to travel, special reserve players will still be considered first. Only if there are still vacancies will other reserve players who have expressed a willingness to travel be considered.

<h3 id="e138">Women's Basketball Circle <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Jie</p>
<p>Although women's basketball in this city isn't experiencing a peak, it's also not in decline. This is evidenced by the championship won at the last National Games, which we should foster.</p>
<p>In terms of teams, there are always around five or six participating in the league, which is quite a lively scene. However, the Green Team consistently wins the championship, which is certainly a result of their hard work, but also indicates a lack of new stars emerging. This is because women often interrupt their playing careers due to marriage, which is an irreparable drawback.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the only recent expedition of a women's basketball team from this city was when the Green Team visited Stone City, which caused quite a sensation. There haven't been any others since. It is said that the Philippines are very interested in inviting our city's women's basketball team this spring. I wonder what obstacles are preventing this wonderful event from happening. To this day, there has been no news or inquiry. With Qian Xuchang's comprehensive abilities, I don't believe he couldn't orchestrate its success. Perhaps it's because basketball in this city is currently in a tense period, and they don't want to divert attention.</p>
<p>Speaking of the current process and situation, everyone can see clearly that the Green Team still firmly holds the top position. The newly formed Li Team is striving to compete and may snatch the second-place spot. The Xinghua team has good talent but seems to lack spirit. Their previous forfeit against the Green Team was unacceptable. Next would be the student army, John's, while the Li Team will likely remain in last place. Given this trend, I will now provide an overview of each team in order to modestly support women's basketball.</p>
<p>Discussing the Reasons for the Green Team's Continuous Victories</p>
<p>The Green Team is undoubtedly a heroine among women. As far as I know, since its formation, except for a defeat under men's rules against the Filipino Black and White team, they have been virtually invincible, maintaining a record of constant victory. They are truly a remarkable team.</p>
<p>In the past, I felt that the Green Team's strength was simply their superior individual skills. However, in this competition, I have seen even greater improvements in their tactics, so not only can we see them winning, but also giving a good performance. They give the audience a more impressive impression, and the Green Team should be seen as the pride of women's basketball.</p>
<p>As for why the Green Team has such a long history and improvement in skill, perhaps readers would like to know some of the reasons. According to what I know, there are several reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Harmony: Harmony means effective management. Xie Yiqin, the team manager, treats each player equally, always offering encouragement, which gives the players a sense of spiritual pleasure, so naturally everyone works hard. At the same time, they always win by a large margin, so after the game, everyone is happy and laughing. There is no blaming each other, as is inevitable with losing teams, so everyone's feelings only deepen and will not dissipate. This point of harmony is said to be a key element of a team's success.</p>
<p>(2) Training: The Green Team's spirit of training is admirable. They have set dates, and if you have something to do, you must formally request leave in advance, otherwise everyone will arrive, regardless of wind, frost, rain, or snow. Over the years, there has been no interruption, so today's success is certainly not accidental.</p>
<p>(3) Good Guidance: The Green Team has had three phases of guidance so far. The first, when the team was first established, was Qian Xuchang. Qian taught them entirely how to avoid the strong and attack the weak, winning by using their strengths against the other team's weaknesses. Later, Qian grew tired, and for a time, no one could be found, so the management, Xie, also took on the role. He specialized in discussing and researching with the players for progress and retreat. Recently, Kong Guangyi, who was hired, should be the third phase. Ah Kong really put in a lot of effort to guide the Green Team, to understand women's basketball, and added his wealth of experience. Recently, he has been able to keep up with the times, striving for excellence, so naturally the Green Team can add icing to the cake in three phases of obtaining guidance.</p>
<p>Speaking of tactics, my impression is that the current Green Team forwards understand and can execute feints, screens, and utilize skilled methods, plus accurate shooting. Therefore, the weaker defending force can only be trampled on. The defenders apply the exchange man-marking to a transformed, skillful, and appropriate level, which no other team can match.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of individuals, the veterans Huang Mingyuan and Wang Weizhen have experience, brains, and skills that are superior. Wu Ailian shoots quickly, and Wu Meiyi is fierce. The newcomer Lu Weijun has momentum, and more worthy of introduction are Zhu Jinyun and Shi Zonglan. The latter has balanced strength, accurate shooting, running speed, and a beautiful posture. As for Zhu Jinyun, she is even more promising, with her elasticity surpassing the others, and she is 19 out of 10 times sure of getting the ball under the basket, and she shoots quickly, has a clear mind, and has flexible hand skills. All are excellent, and she is young, with a brilliant future. I have high hopes for Zhu and Shi!</p>

<h3 id="e139">Musings on Nanjing Road <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Shangyu</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The vendors on Nanjing Road, whether selling "Genuine Mercerized Cotton Dance Socks," "Hong Kong Soap," or "Customs Auction Sanitary Clothing," besides each having their own set of astonishing persuasive skills, also invariably have one or two, or even three or four, "customers" who are constantly picking and choosing.</p>
<p>People who have lived in Shanghai for a long time know that these "customers" are their own people, used to prop up the scene and attract real customers, because people's psychology is always to go where everyone else goes. Moreover, if you pay close attention, you can find that the fake customers who were next to the mercerized cotton sock stall in the morning will appear next to the soap or sanitary clothing stalls in the afternoon. It can be seen that they are also often making mutually beneficial exchanges.</p>
<p>Doing small business is like this, and so is doing the biggest business, like being an official. If you want to stand out, the first thing you have to do is find a group of people to praise you, and these people should preferably seem unrelated to you. If you say this often enough, then others will naturally believe it and truly think that you are quite reasonable.</p>
<p>If you tell a lie often enough, the people will believe it, this is the famous saying of the German propaganda king Goebbels. How many of the eminent gentlemen on the stage today did not come from such origins? And we, the people, because we have heard so many lies, and seen so many people buying them, we can't tell who is selling real mercerized cotton socks, and who is selling silk stockings that tear two big holes as soon as you put them on.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Standing in New World calling for rickshaws, those going to Henan Road all say "going east," and those going to Carter Road all say "going west."</p>
<p>But is Henan Road really going east, and is Carter Road really going west? Not necessarily. If you are standing on the Bund, Henan Road is going west, and if you are at Jing'an Temple, Carter Road is of course in the extreme east. So, the so-called "east" and "west" are just saying what you say from where you are standing.</p>
<p>If you think about it more esoterically, then even the relative nouns of "east" and "west" are difficult to exist. The earth is round, which is something everyone believes. Then, if you go west from New World, around the circle of the earth, wouldn't you still be able to reach the Bund? Then, should the Bund be said to be east of New World, or the extreme west?</p>
<p>There is a Western saying: The two poles meet. The extreme west is also east, and the extreme east is also west. East and west are like this, and so are left and right.</p>
<p>Therefore, today's world is so concerned about the division of left and right in thought, which is actually unnecessary. Because what is right at Jing'an Temple is left at the Bund. And from the perspective of the entire circle of the earth, the so-called left and right are just nouns that people have come up with to confuse themselves.</p>
<p>The more you divide "east" and "west," the more chaotic the direction becomes; the more nouns you create, the more chaotic the world becomes.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Strange Marriage Customs in the Netherlands <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>Although the Netherlands is a small country, the customs of its various regions are different, and some are quite peculiar. For example, in Stavoren, which has a population of nearly 10,000, the way young men and women get together is still stuck in the era of five hundred years ago. Compared carefully, it is almost the same as the marriage customs of the Li people of Hainan Island in our country.</p>
<p>If a young man in Stavoren falls in love with a local girl, he will take advantage of her going out and snatch the cloth sash tightly around her waist, in which her raincoat is placed. If she lets him snatch her raincoat, it means that she has acquiesced to his courtship. Then, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings, he can go to her private room (which her father built for her next to the house), whistle for a while, and then climb through the window into the room and spend the night with her. Until she becomes pregnant, the two announce their engagement. But before the girl becomes pregnant, engagement is not allowed.</p>
<p>If the time for sneaking around passes for three and a half months, and the girl is still unable to get pregnant, her parents and friends will despise her and suspect her. Moreover, her lover, if he becomes tired of her, can put a straw man in front of her window at any time to declare his breakup with her.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if the girl becomes pregnant, and her lover changes his mind and refuses to get engaged to her, he will be severely punished by the local residents. A group of young people will catch him, whip him, and then tie him to the roof of a carriage and send him to the girl's house, and lock him in the pigsty to sleep and eat with the pigs, until he begs the girl for forgiveness and agrees to get engaged to her, then he can regain his freedom. Otherwise, he should not think about getting out of the pigsty.</p>
<p>Soon after the engagement, an engaged couple will hold a wedding ceremony in a public hall. After the wedding, the couple must live in separate rooms until the bride gives birth to her first child, and then they can start sleeping in the same bed.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Spring arrives, busy on both sides of Humen, peach blossoms bright, chrysanthemums yellow, I am now a newcomer to the south, I suspect even the heavens are in disarray. (In early spring, peaches and chrysanthemums bloom in Guangzhou, which Northerners find to be a strange sight.)</p>
<p>The ancient Pagoda of Six Banyan Trees emerges from the clouds, overlooking the southeast, there is still righteousness between heaven and earth, Huanghuagang and Baiyun Mountain. (Huanghuagang is where the seventy-two martyrs are buried, and Baiyun Mountain is where the martyrs of the anti-Japanese war in Guangdong are buried. I once went up the ancient pagoda of the Six Banyan Trees to look far away, and could see them clearly.)</p>
<p>Endless green climbs the window screen, red kapok blossoms fill the trees, don't ask about the news from Shanglin, now business is in the farmers' homes. (In spring, kapok blooms profusely, fiery red and dazzling.)</p>
<p>After drinking, I returned from the Hundred-Foot Tower, drunk, I drifted on a boat on the Lychee Bay, the Pearl River water smiled, the children were busy. (From "Haichiao Red House" on the Pearl River to "Lychee Bay," the boats come and go like weaving.)</p>
<h3 id="e142">Hunan's Fish <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qun</p>
<p>A few days ago, this column published an article about "fish." After reading it, I thought of the fish in my hometown of Pingjiang, Hunan.</p>
<p>There are many ponds in my hometown. In Yizi, there must be one or even several ponds in front of or behind the house. Because there are so many ponds, it is not uncommon for children to fall in and drown. What are so many ponds used for? Besides paying attention to feng shui, washing clothes and raising fish are the two main functions.</p>
<p>The most common types of fish raised are two: one is grass carp, with large scales, thick body, coarse meat, and eats grass; small fish are placed in the pond in spring, and by the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, they weigh more than two catties. The other is silver carp, with fine scales, wide and flat body, and white color, and eats pig manure and grass carp manure; small fish are placed in the pond in spring, and by the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, they can weigh more than three catties. If these two types of fish are raised in the pond, grass and manure must be cut and poured in regularly.</p>
<p>If the fish are put into the pond for three or five years, silver carp can grow to ten or twenty catties, and grass carp can grow to thirty or forty catties, as long as a carrying pole.</p>
<p>In addition to grass carp and silver carp, a slightly rarer variety is the so-called "Pangtou," which is the same shape as silver carp, except that it has a particularly large head. Therefore, in my hometown, people with big heads are often given the nickname "Pangtou." Another type is the so-called "Qingzhu," which is probably a type of grass carp, shaped like grass carp but dark green in color, and is said to be very nourishing, and is best for people who have just recovered from a serious illness.</p>
<p>The above are the most common domestic fish, all raised in ponds. In addition, there are fish and shrimp everywhere in the small rivers. When the water rises, it is a good opportunity to catch fish. In the misty rain, wearing straw raincoats, spreading nets by the river, what is caught are all tumbling and jumping fish and shrimp. I have also experienced this clear interest. When the rain stops, the small river is even more suddenly crowded with people, some using nets to catch, and some reaching out into the cracks in the stones to touch. Enthusiastic people catch fish all day during the day, and also light pine firewood at night to catch.</p>
<p>Speaking of lighting pine firewood to catch fish, I also thought of loach in the rice fields. Loach are all caught using pine firewood at night. This kind of thing, the deliciousness of the taste, I think exceeds chicken meat. Insiders have a unique way of cooking, which is to first put the loach into a vegetable oil jar and let it drink its fill of vegetable oil, and then cook it in soup. The loach cooked in this way tastes indeed better.</p>
<p>According to rural customs, when inviting guests in the first month of the lunar calendar, there is usually a bowl of fish on the banquet, but it is often not eaten, but only placed there as a formality, because it is inconvenient to go to the pond to net fish in cold weather, and it is not easy to buy. Sometimes it is not even cooked, and a bowl of raw fish is placed there, perhaps to prevent those ignorant or joking guests from rashly starting to eat it.</p>

<p>Swimming Pool</p>
<p>A nouveau riche boasted to a friend about how magnificent his newly built villa was and how complete the equipment was. He said:</p>
<p>"Inside, there are three swimming pools, one with cold water, one with hot water, and one without water."</p>
<p>"The cold water and hot water ones don't need to be said," the friend said. "But what does the one without water mean?"</p>
<p>"Because," he replied, "I found that many of the friends who come don't know how to swim."</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Story of Dice <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Dice are one of the oldest and most common gambling tools. Remains of using two dice for gambling games have been found in ancient tombs in Egypt and the Far East. In ancient Greece, almost every banquet ended with a dice game. Their method of throwing was slightly different from that of the East. They used three dice, and the person who threw three sixes "ate the entire pot."</p>
<p>During the era when the Roman Empire was enjoying a life of indulgence and luxury, the favored sons of heaven, the Romans, were particularly fond of gambling. However, gambling was forbidden among the common people, so initially, only nobles used their "official" status to play dice games on a large scale. A recently discovered record shows that Emperor Augustus once threw a "supreme reality," winning the entire pot. Another great Roman general, Mark Antony, threw dice while stationed in Alexandria. The Roman tyrant Nero also liked to throw dice. Claudius I even wrote a book about dice gambling.</p>
<p>As a result, the gambling trend spread from the top down, and it became prevalent among the common people. Therefore, the authorities had to formulate special laws to prohibit anyone from gambling. Anyone whose house was found to be a gathering place for gambling would be mercilessly arrested and brought to the Roman court.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the gambling trend also declined. Later, in the Middle Ages, the gambling trend of throwing two dice revived and spread throughout Europe. Even the Crusaders liked to throw dice. Schools and guilds for throwing dice were even established one after another, a strange phenomenon unprecedented in history. Although the laws prohibiting gambling were extremely strict, the warriors and their ladies still threw dice as usual, and their gambling enthusiasm did not diminish.</p>
<p>Dice even helped white people seize land on the American continent. Native Americans loved to throw dice, and they often used large pieces of land as stakes in dice games with white people. The white people used their mathematical minds and rigged dice to always win, gaining large amounts of land without labor.</p>
<p>During World War II, American soldiers also loved to play dice games. According to an estimate by a certain military magazine, at least 95% of American soldiers were fond of throwing dice and did so frequently, even though the authorities strictly prohibited gambling, it was of no use.</p>
<h3 id="e145">A History of Scalpers <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Xin</p>
<p>Scalpers have become an occupation outside of the traditional 360 trades. There are scalpers in front of movie theaters, scalpers at banks exchanging gold and silver, and scalpers selling silver dollars on the street. Today's Shanghai, open your eyes and look, is entirely a world of scalpers. Some people doubt whether scalping can be considered an occupation? In fact, that is unnecessary. But looking at the current number of scalpers, the breadth of their distribution, it is estimated that there are tens of thousands of people who make a living as scalpers. Of course, they can occupy a place outside of the 360 trades. Although the objects they trade often change, this is just like nomadic peoples, living by water and grass, and it is precisely their changes during their growth process.</p>
<p>The scalper's business started with rice and daily necessities and rose to prominence by relying on surplus American materials. Now, it is very full-fledged. The emergence of scalpers dates back to the War of Resistance. At that time, Shanghai was reduced to an isolated island, and goods from the surrounding countryside could not be transported into the concessions. The most serious of these was food. The former Municipal Council authorities, in order to alleviate the food panic, specially transported foreign rice and distributed it to rice shops for sale at parity prices. At that time, there were no rice ration cards, so abuses abounded, and scalpers emerged in response. They squeezed into the long snake lines in front of the rice shops, bought rice, and resold it to people who could not mill rice or could not get rice. They relied on their ability to squeeze to make a living.</p>
<p>Once the scalper trend started, it grew day by day. Initially, it was only rice milling. Later, oil, sugar, cigarettes and other daily necessities were sold, and their traces could be found everywhere. Soon, the Municipal Council discovered their secrets and adopted the method of rationing certificates, cutting off the scalpers' livelihood, thus forcing them to transfer their positions. At that time, going out was a difficult task, and buying a ticket was the first problem. The scalpers found this gap and began to swarm towards train stations and wharves.</p>
<p>In times of war, everything is somewhat abnormal. In isolated Shanghai, although life was very difficult, many people held a carefree attitude, living one day at a time, seeking entertainment and enjoyment. The general nouveau riche were even more extravagant, indulging in pleasure to their heart's content. All entertainment venues were packed. Buying tickets at the theater door was like buying household rice, with very long lines. The scalpers' sharp eyes saw that there was another opportunity to take advantage of, so they expanded their territory, and the front of the theater also became their students' hangout.</p>
<p>After the victory, large quantities of surplus American materials poured in. These many goods, in addition to a small number being imported by formal commercial firms, were mostly brought in privately by warships or merchant ships. They were eager to dispose of them. Driven by profit, the scalpers would certainly not give up. Thus, selling American military supplies became their greatest livelihood, and running the docks was also their main job. The dense layers of stalls in the Zhu Bao San Road area were all rich grasslands for the scalpers. As for the price-limit period after "August 19th," it was the most glorious time for the scalpers. The streets and alleys were full of scalpers. This was already witnessed by all and need not be said more.</p>
<p>Economic and financial programs were changed again and again. From the collection and exchange of gold and silver to the exchange of gold and silver, the scalpers became even more active. Banks were to open at 9:00 am, but around the Bund, scalpers were already active there the night before. After the midnight curfew, they would ambush in the small alleys next door or on sampans in the Huangpu River. They also adopted a united front, and outsiders could not get a foothold. This time they harvested the most. Getting a registration form could allow them to enjoy ten and a half months. If it were not for the deaths caused by squeezing and trampling, if the Central Bank had continued to accept and exchange, many of them might have become wealthy landowners. Now, it is the era of silver dollars. The sound of "buying and selling big heads and small heads" can be heard from morning to night, but this is just picking up some dregs from the gold and silver exchange. Although the number of people seems vast, the profits are actually small. The golden age of scalpers seems to be over.</p>
