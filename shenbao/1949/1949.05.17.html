<h3>陸海空軍澈夜作戰　月浦共軍全部殲滅　南匯共軍向沙城進犯國軍已馳往圍剿　虹橋以北南園方面肅清</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方十六日午後九時消息：月浦及小顧宅附近殘匪，自十五日晨被我守軍側背夾擊後，已成甕中之龜，至昨午後二時止，月浦方面犯匪業告全部肅清，小顧宅方面犯匪亦傷亡過半，殘部紛紛向西逃竄，入夜匪復分股向我獅子林月浦牛角尖楊行等處我軍陣地蠢犯，激戰澈夜，至本日侵晨，匪軍始終未能越雷池一步。綜計前後我俘匪八十餘人，鹵獲步槍三十餘枝，輕重機槍六挺，步騎槍百餘枝，衝鋒槍一枝，斃傷匪連長以下三百餘名。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方十六日上午九時消息：（一）十五日午夜十二時匪二十八軍廿二軍傾其全力向我月浦楊行等陣地猛撲，反覆衝殺數在七八次以上，但我守軍仍本近幾日來沈着應戰之精神給來匪以迎頭痛擊，戰況繼續至十六日拂曉，匪攻勢頓挫，即向後敗退，檢視棄屍，約三千餘具。是役我陸海空軍協同作戰，發揮威力極大，據確訊匪此次攻擊傷亡至少在六千人以上，傍午戰事轉趨沉寂，我軍將乘戰勝餘威，於有利態勢下，出動有力部隊反擊，陷匪於疲于奔命之中。</p>
<p>（二）匪廿九軍自十二日晚向月浦楊行陣地連續攻擊以來，因守軍奮勇殺敵，屢遭挫敗，且蒙受嚴重之損失，傷亡泰半，自十五日晨向後潰退無蹤，現已不復發現該匪番號，判斷似已無再戰能力，後調整補中。</p>
<p>（三）我某部曾於十五日午間派強大兵力出擊，向劉家行以西之李家樓匪軍據點猛攻，斃傷匪六百餘名，生俘匪百餘名，獲步機槍廿五枝，匪不支，向西逃逸，傍晚戰事告一段落，故是日劉家行一綫竟夜無戰事。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方十六日正午十二時消息：楊行方面我軍，今晨七時在空軍有砲兵協力下，對疲憊之匪作機動性之奇襲，所獲戰果甚大，計得匪重機槍二挺，步槍卅餘枝，并生擒匪政委一名，士兵四址餘名，我無損失。又，竄犯南園之小股匪軍，經我軍反擊後，已向西流竄，刻南園周圍已無匪蹤。另息：由南匯北竄之匪軍一部，曾於十五日下午二時向沙城進犯，我已派出有力部隊馳往圍剿中。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕淞滬防衛司令部發佈戰況：</p>
<p>（一）牛角尖與楊行方面之匪昨（十五日）晚八時起向我軍陣地猛犯，經我正面部隊奮勇迎擊，側翼某部精銳，復奉命出擊，以鉗形攻勢對犯匪猛烈反擊，匪軍卽全綫潰竄，遺屍五百餘具，計是役我俘匪六百餘名，鹵獲步槍九十支，輕機槍九挺。</p>
<p>（二）匪卅七軍警衛團兩營，今晨一時向七寶作試探性攻擊，守軍士氣極盛，集中火力猛轟，匪傷亡慘重，我俘獲匪八十餘名，截至發稿時止，雙方仍對峙中。</p>
<p>（三）沿青滬路東竄之匪，經判明為匪二七軍某部，一度向我南園（虹橋機場北）據點進犯，經當地守軍反擊，旋卽抱頭鼠竄，退至距南園十餘里地帶，刻無動靜。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕空軍總司令部發佈：大上海保衛戰昨（十六）日進入第五日，共軍向上海凶猛攻勢，經四日來陸海空三軍協同喋血抵抗，尤以空軍晝夜出動，炸射其砲陣，襲擊其補給部隊，使共軍損失奇重，致自十五日晚起大上海外圍第一綫除劉行爭奪戰甚烈外，大部共軍均在沉寂狀態。軍方判斷，共軍正作調整部署，昨終日狂風陰雨襲灑上海，空軍依舊冒惡劣天氣，作保衛大上海之第五日戰鬥，計獲得以下戰果：</p>
<p>（一）空車主力支援吳淞要塞區外圍劉行，楊行陸軍戰鬥，月浦，楊行昨整日較為沉寂，共軍集全力爭奪屏障大場機場之劉行，空軍在劉行鎮附近八字橋，顧家宅，堅橋等村落炸斃共軍千餘名，在楊行炸毀其砲陣二處，碉堡工事五處，在支援劉行鎮作戰中，　度劉行鎮被共軍攻入，均經空軍在天空猛炸，將其大部殲滅，但仍有數百名頑據劉行鎮內大樓三處不退，經投下燃燒直接命中起火焚燒，陸軍更進而撲進，始將其全部殲滅。</p>
<p>（二）狙擊崑山南來，松江北上之共軍部隊約千餘名，在唯亭炸爆卡車五輛。</p>
<p>（三）炸斃真如外圍工事內共軍五百餘。</p>
<p>（四）炸毀川沙東南白龍港登陸之共軍木船五十餘只。</p>
<h3>國軍條件極有利　確保上海具把握　淞滬警備部昨招待記者</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕淞滬警備司令部，十六日下午三時舉行記者招待會，該部政工處長張泰祥及副司令周力行氏，先後分析本市保衛戰形勢。據稱，國軍保衛大上海，具有數項有利條件：（一）四郊防禦工事極為堅強，其密度較史太林格勒多約三分之一；閻錫山過滬時，曾謂本市工事較太原猶強。（二）國軍士氣旺盛，作戰意志堅強，共軍則三分之一是俘虜，三分之一是新兵，真能作戰者僅有三分之一。（三）市區治安確保，警備部決以武力壓制暴亂。此外，本市交通便利，物資豐厚，補給方便，糧食燃料可支持半截，地形港灣交叉之有利於守，共方人海戰術及坑道戰術無能為力，故相信如無意外，必能堅守。目前正面共軍兵力約有廿四·廿五·廿六·廿八·九等六個軍，分別自京滬路及滬杭路兩側向本市逼迫，其主力雖已到達，尚未展開。依照軍事正規情形，攻擊準備約需一星期，則共軍之主力進攻應在本月二十日以後。惟共軍對上海之總攻，發動越早，其所犯錯誤越大。目前獅子林月浦一戰，共軍狂妄來犯，遺屍八千餘具即為一例，我軍是役之傷亡數字，僅為廿分之一。并譬喻共軍之攻勢如放風箏，隨時可能為國軍切斷其後路，而遭受覆敗之命運。再者，上海目前水路仍甚暢通，空運則在加強中，故此後軍民生活必需品之供運可不成問題，現在猶為序幕戰，主力大戰尚未揭開，只要各界人士一致支援軍隊，確保上海有絕對把握。</p>
<h3>劉伯中對記者談　淞滬保衛戰前途</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕記者昨訪某高級司令部參謀長劉伯中將軍，當承忙中接見，彼稱：「淞滬保衛戰日來尚屬前奏曲，一切準備，皆早已完成，足可應付匪之任何攻勢，而克服粉碎之」。記者詢及戰略問題，彼以樂觀態度答謂：「戰略乃綜合運用的藝術，當前以陸海空軍的密切配合，對付匪軍片面的地面攻勢，以立體作戰對付匪軍的滲透作戰，并且此次負責指揮作戰的幾位高級將領，都是威望素著的戰略家，各部隊官兵，又都是疆場百戰，英勇奮發之士，當然有剋敵致勝的把握」。記者又詢及月浦楊行方面戰況，彼笑謂：「耗子徘徊鐵籠子外面，能發揮什麼作用，若是竄進鐵籠子，這吃苦頭的後果，還用多說嗎，請留意最近的情勢發展，與事實表現好了」。</p>

<h3>城破巷戰軍民逐戶抵抗　保衛太原壯烈事蹟　齊敬德李幹之上閻錫山函電全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州十六日電〕晋省府視察主任齊敬德，由西安致電行政院賈副院長轉閻主任九日電稱：「敵人於四月九日對太原作第七次總攻時，除原有兵力卅餘萬外，又由河北河南調來大批精銳部隊十餘萬，配有特別堅強砲兵，又大量使用毒氣以致我軍民死傷特重，軍民逐戶抵抗，我英勇軍民死傷枕籍，房屋亦幾盡破壞，以致共匪入城後甚難覓得完整牆壁張貼佈告。我文武高級人員除孫楚·王靖國·薛毓相·英紹之等四人被俘外，其餘人員自殺抑被俘，迄出城時，尚不詳悉，惟確知省府委員代行主席職務之梁化之暨徐處長風；吳隊長福熙等一百二十餘人，均於廿五日城破後集體服毒，壯烈成仁，并縱火自焚。所有城外碉堡截至廿六日，仍有多處繼續抵抗。」閻主任又接第七區行政專員李幹之五月九日由西安來函，敘述太原最後作戰經過稱：五月四日陽曲副縣長張克寒脫險抵陝，對我太原保衛戰情形，陳述頗詳，除囑該同志函陳外，謹將獲悉各節，臚陳於次：（一）攻我太原匪軍主力為彭德懷，聶榮臻，徐向前三部四十萬人左右，而担架隊及抬棺材人民亦在三十萬左右，其指揮官為彭德懷。（二）匪軍所用之武器，大小砲計三四十門，輕重機槍無算，最重要者為十五公分流彈砲及毒瓦斯與催淚性毒親等。（三）此次匪攻我太原，係自四月九日開始，激戰至十九日，匪以「人海」「火海」，及「穿隙滲透」等戰術，一面攻我郊外據點，一面向城猛撲戰況至為慘烈，至廿日匪都屬接近城下外壕，城週戰事慘烈空前，是時匪砲兵復以「冷雹」戰術向城內射擊，每日所落砲彈不下五六萬發，將我城內工事及一切建築物大部火化，我境內預備兵運動困難，續戰至廿一廿二兩日在大北關一帶城墻有兩處被匪以人海火海戰術衝破，均經我守軍奮勇抵抗，擊退敵人，補住破口。至廿四日上午五時許，城西南門外西數火處曾被炮轟決口，匪突入城，遂開展巷戰，至廿五日上午，我軍傷亡殆盡，城陷匪手，而郊外據點戰至廿六日上午始分別被匪佔據。（四）此次我太原保衛戰殲匪廿萬左右，確以我英勇官兵均能一本鈞座「寸土必守」「一屋必爭」之昭示，努力奮鬥犧牲所使然。而我民眾尤能發揮堅決反共之精神，助軍作戰，在槍林彈雨下給官兵送茶飯，抬送傷兵，構築工事，消滅火災，表現偉大之力量。（五）此次保衛戰，除我官兵死傷數字驚人外，我人民傷亡變在五萬左右，城內公私建築物百分之九十已化灰燼，如柳巷·帽兒巷·紅市牌樓等街，幾無一完屋，一片瓦礫，滿目淒然。（六）梁委員化之及徐端·尹遵黨·嵐風·吳福熙·等一百廿餘人聞於匪突進城後，在梁委員公館（即特種警憲指揮所）集　　體壯烈成仁。又聞梁委員成仁後，其公館已成火海，已完成無論平日明告屍體不見敵人之訓示。（七）孫·王·薛·吳均被匪俘，匪對王侮辱百般，臉上被打青紅，解送榆次時，匪兵數人將王由地面抬起摔到車上，狀極淒慘。</p>

<h3>閩西南土地改革　推行後收效良好　農收增加社會秩序大見改善</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處廣州十六日電〕福建省西南部記下接受中美農村復興聯合委會之經濟援助，推行土地改革與農村復興計劃，此係利用美元協助中國農民實行自助之一种實例。</p>
<p>中國農村復興聯合委會，係依照一九四八年之援華法案而成立者，俾協助中國農村推行復興計劃，繼續辦理此項計劃之基金，係包括於國會於上月核准之延長對華經濟援助之基金中者。上述新法案使經合總署及中美農村復興聯合委會在截至一九五〇年二月一日為止之時期內，得以使用五四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，按上述款項係原先之援華法案下猶未用去之基金。</p>
<p>中美晨村復興聯合委會估計該委會將在總額中獲得約一五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，俾在未來一年中協助推行地方性之農村復興計劃。</p>
<p>在此一數額中，九五，九二六美元已分配予福建方面之計劃，俾使土地之所有權移讓予實際從事耕種者，完成四項灌溉計劃以謀增加農產，以及成立一種農村信用貸款。此項基金將分配如下，以三九，〇〇〇美元在福建西南部之六區實行土地改革，以三六，九二六美元在龍岩區完成四個灌溉計劃，以二〇，〇〇〇美元作為對龍岩農民之信用貸款，截至目前，該區地方當局已獲得二〇，〇〇〇美元。</p>
<p>供土地改革用之三九，〇〇〇美元將協助上蛇，永定，武平，連城，漳平與長汀等六區之地方當局獲得土地，俾分配之無土地之農民。此項基金將用以協助地方政府進行必要之土地調查，藉以確定土地分配之基礎。此項土地係由政府依照地產收用權而加以獲得，而於農民以美物付出最近三年中地租之平均數之百分之二百五十後，即將土地移交之。</p>
<p>該委會為灌溉龍岩而撥付之三六，九二六元，將協助完成目前正在唐河·鄧岡·蕭陽·廣壩（譯音）進行之兩項工作，農民於水利設備擴充，穀物收穫增加後，即可償還此款。此種償還資金將用於設立一項週轉金，以實施其他計劃，促進本區農民利益。</p>
<p>為數二萬元之農村信用貸款，將用於購買肥料，水牛并救濟現為高利貸所苦之農民（委會基金係屬贈予款項，不取利息）。該委會資金并將用於購辦改良之種子，殺虫及防植物藥劑，以及更佳品種之猪豕。龍岩當地政府機關亦將籌措等量之資金，以湊成四萬元總數。現在龍岩實施之土地改革計劃，已成為一種範型，附近區域內由該委會所協助發動之計劃皆可循此舉辦。在龍岩僅實際耕者始得分配土地，惟急切依賴土地為生之地主諸如寡婦或老年人者則除外，彼等暫得保留其土地所有權，直到其對於收之需要不再存在為止，屆時土將地移交與佃農，政府利用土地收用權，取得土地，而按照土地價值，賠償業主。</p>
<p>此項土地係根據家庭人數之多少所分配者，四人或四人以下之家庭可獲十二至二十畝，四人以上之家庭，則超過四人之每人可多獲土地百分之廿五，（計算標準為每畝可以每年生產糙米一石者。）耕種者以後不得經由購買而獲得更多之土地。</p>
<p>龍岩之土改革計劃足以實現中美農村復興聯合委會之主要目的之一，此即由此項計劃而獲得之復興將屬諸人民而非屬諸少數人。龍岩約有人口一四〇，〇〇〇人，其中一二〇，〇〇〇人為農民。</p>
<p>中美農村復興聯合委會之調查，顯示此項計劃在改善生活情形上業已產生顯著之利益，農收已見增加，農村之資本亦已加多。簡言之，農民現已有足夠之食物可食而已往則非。目前大多數農民已能穿着現代衣服，而已往曾有一時彼等大多數均穿破衣。破舊簡陋之房屋大部份現已代以新的或業經修葺之房屋，估計統盤之生活水準憶提高百分之廿。</p>
<p>農收亦已有相當於上述百分率之增加。</p>
<p>中美農村復興聯合委會之調查員復報告該區之秩序已大覓改善，該區并無乞丐，盜竊之案件甚少，城鎮之土地爭執前佔訴訟中之百分之四十三，現儘佔百分之八矣。</p>
<p>再者，農民以能耕種自己所有之土地而自傲，因此共產主義已無動聽之作用。調查結果顯示該區全無共產黨之活動—雖共產黨在周圍各區甚為活躍，抑有進者，該項計劃之儘有敵人即為在廣東邊境活動之工黨份子。</p>

<h3>白崇禧主持長沙指揮所　積極完成新部署　武漢有計劃撤退已完畢</h3>
<p>〔中央社長沙十六日電〕華中長官公署發言人稱：華中軍事要衝之武漢三鎮，因戰略關係，我華中最高指揮部奉令將武漢守軍作有計劃撤退，華中軍政長官白崇禧將軍特於本月十三日自穗飛漢，親自督飭，至十五日，我全部守軍及一切軍用物資等均已全部主動按計劃撤離武漢，漢口之少數防守部隊，亦已於昨日渡江抵達武昌，繼續南移，僅有少數不堪使用之破爛戰車·裝甲車·載重汽車共約六十餘輛，殘留該處。白長官於十五日午十二時許始行離漢，率同幕僚人員飛抵長沙，主持該署長沙指揮所，積極完成作戰之新部署。再，白氏離漢前，曾召見武漢耆宿孔庚·耿伯釗諸氏，訓示應責成地方民眾自衛隊協助警察維持地方秩序，嚴防不良份子騷擾。此次國軍撤退武漢時，紀律甚屬良好，所有公用事業一切設備均遵令保存，至前為軍事着眼，將武泰等閘保持相當泛濫，刻已將閘內蓄水放出，藉重民生。</p>
<h3>北平和平真象　（續昨）</h3>
<p>甚至說到傳宜生三字，他也　作未之前聞者，必使必作傳作義，他屢次強調他們所以到那時還沒進城的緣故，並非是他們自己打不下來，而是怕燬了這座文化故都，他更強調的叫大家認清并不是傳作義保住了北平城，而是北平城保護了傅作義，設他仍執迷不悟，那麼燬壞北平的責任，就別寫在共軍的賬上了。他劈頭先說：要談和就必須先答應毛主席所提的八條件，否則那就根本別談，代表們聽了他的高論之後，何思源就首先把八條件答應了九小數點九，認為其他均無問題，只是第一條的戰犯把傅先生的大名摘出來就夠了，其他代表認為他答應得有點過火，羣謂我們是人民代表，任務只是敲開和平之門，至於條件，則希望雙方直接去談談了，幾次所得結論，仍是請雙方直接談判，當晚住下，次日下午返城，被招待了兩頓極豐富的盛餐，并佐以馳名的海淀仁和棧蓮花白酒，代表們在城內一個多月不知肉味了，都樂得過屠門而大嚼，後來盛傳有人喝醉，實無其事，返城之前，共方的條件是不許并談判情形在報紙上透露，故回城後，十代表均守口如瓶，日以如何躲避新聞記者為能事，故上所述種種，知者甚鮮。</p>
<p>至於軍方的和平醞釀，則以傅先生始終守口如瓶，甚至如他左右的河北主席楚晴波及剿總副秘書長　　　，都以他不透半字而常發牢騷，他人更可想而知了，從按事後各種跡象摸索似乎傅先生的私人代表是鄧　珊，郭宗汾，周北峯，秦豐川，崔載之五位，在和約簽字之前，屢次與林彪，葉劍英，聶榮臻等　　，最後於一月廿二日簽訂了協定廿五款，但在報上隻公佈了十三條。</p>
<p>（六）狂歡一日</p>
<p>北平人歷盡滄桑，飽經懮患，世故之深，舉世無匹，故除被迫表演像美國孩子般的真正狂歡，實難遇到，我是蘆溝橋人，距北平很近，在我的記憶裏，可以稱得起舉城狂歡的事件只有三次，第一次是廿五年十二月廿五日，蔣委員長的西安脫險，那時北平人自甲午戰後，已被日本欺侮了四十餘年，尤以九一八後，冀東政府就在眼前，日鮮浪人無理取鬧，把人民壓得透不過氣來，他們唯一的希望，就是抗日，但抗日的中心力量，蔣委員長蒙難了，又還有什麼希望呢！經過了十三日的苦悶，忽聞他脫險了，又怎能不狂歡呢，這是第一次。其次是卅四年的勝利，抗日戰起，北平最先淪陷，經畏族八年的蹂躪，一旦國家勝利，真把人給樂得不知所措了，這是第二次。第三次就要算今年的一月廿三日了，北平自去年十二月十四日圍城起到這天，已整整的被圍四旬，在這四十天裏面，北平人雖然沉得住氣，秩序仍舊，但很像人將死以膠的安祥，空着急又有什麼用呢，新保安的例子，人人都已知道，再來個數十萬發砲彈，北平也必蹈新保安的覆轍，人類到了最危險的時候，本能上希求不死，而今和平條約於一月廿二日簽字了，眼前先可以不死了，恰　一個死裏逃生的人，其狂歡又當用什麼辭句來形容呢，何況既已死裏逃生，又可平平安安的過年，還有什麼事再比這件事值得高興呢，那天的物價狂跌了，狂跌的程度，比勝利那年還利害，頭天的大頭賣三百六十元金圓劵，那天跌到一百八，豬肉原賣現場大頭四斤，今則賣到一塊大頭四斤了，其餘物價都至少跌進一倍，死裏逃生過太平年，失到物價的重壓，直是福壽全來，我想再用作我們這樣的筆下，也描寫不出那天北平人愉快的心情了。</p>
<p>但是最可悲的是好景不常，盛筵難再，北平人究竟還要罪　深重，大難未滿，狂歡的日子只過了一天，僅僅只有一天廿四日就不成了，或許是人們於過度狂歡之餘，又恢復了若干理智，主為和平十三條不是和平而是投降，於是物價重漲了，而且漲得很快，大頭是物價的標準，廿四日漲到二百八，廿五日又漲回三百六，廿六日漲到四百八，較圍城時還貴了，如此大漲，到二月一日已漲到一千出頭，加以社會秩序大亂，搶案每天至少發生五六起，幻想被現實說服了，人又都聽拉起腦袋來了，但人總把希望寄託在未來，今年不好，希望來年能轉眼運，眼運不好，希望走鼻運時能發財，今生不好，希望來生進天堂，這個政府不好，希望那個政府會十全十美，而且永遠把將來或說親臨過的環境幻想得完美無缺，樂觀者謂這是兩個政權交替時應有的現象，等二月一日聯合機構成立，解放軍入城後就好了，然而事實又如何呢？看吧！（未完待續）</p>
<h3>拜訪羅店前綫</h3>
<p>— 趙鶴</p>
<p>自嘉定以北向東至寶山一帶，為上海咽喉之地，形勢衝要。聞守衛該地區的國軍，曾揚威於薄弱戰場的有力部隊。</p>
<p>記者於昨晨九時乘吉普車赴羅店前綫訪問，沿途戰壕縱橫交錯，堡壘星羅棋佈，途中檢查極嚴，幾乎是五步一崗，十步一哨。記者經多次的盤問，至十一時始到達羅店。當向武裝同志探詢担任這一防綫的××部官長住址時，均異口同聲的回稱「不知道」！這使記者非常受窘，隨後有一便衣人員（事後始知為該部政工人員）前來問明記者一切後，又幾經轉折，始得會見該部的馬團長。見面時，團長很親切地握着手連說：「歡迎！」「不過你能來到這地方，可也不容易啊！」記者當問街上的士兵，是否屬於貴部下？為何探問官長住址時均回「不知道」呢？馬氏笑道：『這就是我們「保密」的秘訣！當你在街上問這問那時，我們已經知道了，便衣人員是這裏派去的，老百姓隨時看見面貌陌生的人都會向本部報告的，你今天業的機會太好，即刻有好消息告訴你，現在由劉幹事在隔壁房中陪你談談。</p>
<p>記者即隨劉幹事走到另一房中閑談，劉幹事又告訴了不少是他認為不足奇而為記者所驚異的事實。他說：「本部政工人員地位很高，任務甚重，對於組訓民眾，至為嚴密，士兵教育，亦極澈底。在本月六日，我第六大隊奉命赴瀏河一帶游擊時，因須赴浮橋一帶偵察地形及匪情，該隊副指導員史文杰當自告奮勇，與一同志化裝前往。到達前進鄉六里橋，再向浮橋方面走了約一里多路，突由麥田竄出不少匪軍，押着他倆走向匪巢時，我方神出鬼沒的弟兄們，就在這時截擊匪徒，史文杰在雙方開槍的剎跑回原陣。匪徒經不起我的火力，四散奔逃，我英勇的弟兄們，當活捉匪徒十六名，勝利而歸』。他接着說：「因為我們對軍風紀之整飭非常認真，除便衣政工人員隨時巡視外，并獎勵人民檢舉，更因為我們對人民嚴守信義，因此而獲得人民的協助真是太大。今後的戡亂工作，如能善用人民的力量，一定會加速我們勝利的來臨！」</p>
<p>當記者與劉幹事閑談時，隔壁團長室內情況，似甚緊張而又興奮，電話鈴聲不絕，團長的囑咐語：「要機警！」「痛快的消滅！」「儘量的活捉！……」「好！好！」不時從團長室傳出來，記者的情緒，亦隨之而緊張。</p>
<p>約歷一時許，傳令兵請記者至團長室。團長滿面笑容，以興奮的語調，以本日該團第三連奔襲嘉定北陸渡橋之戰鬥經過告訴記者：「共匪廿八軍八六師，於六日由直塘方面竄來，企圖騷擾嘉定，破壞滬太公塘方面竄來，企圖騷擾嘉定，破壞滬太公路，其搜索連駐在陸渡橋，本團當予以嚴密監視，伺機襲擊，該股匪軍異常機警，以難明我方部署，遲未採取行動，我方洞燭共匪慎於夜間警戒而疎於日間，當派第三連兩排，第二連兩班，由第三連連長韓國均統一指揮，於今日拂曉出發，以一排便衣在前，其餘隨後，齊向陸渡橋奔襲。</p>
<p>「第三連上等兵孟紀蘭由麥田匍匐前進里許，至橋頭近旁，見匪哨正在橋頭持槍大踱其八字步，毫無覺察，趁其轉過身時，，即從田內躍起，神不知鬼不覺的上前將匪哨緊緊抱住，同往之下士副班長柳志清，隨即搶步上前將匪槍繳下，時村內仍漠然不覺，當迫使匪哨供出匪方情況，立即回報連長排長速帶隊伍前來，孟秀蘭當將匪哨交給柳志清看守，親提衝鋒槍進入村內，發現匪十餘人，在隔壁院內開飯，當即擊斃匪徒三人，轉過屋角，又結果了一個，這時第二連少尉排長杜震已率領兩班弟兄神速的衝入陸渡橋，匪部幾疑兵從天降，慌忙無措，倉惶北潰，計匪遺屍十八具，俘匪十餘名，鹵槍三支，手槍一枝，馬兩匹，電報機一部等」。最後，團長以堅決的口吻告記者稱：「這次奔襲，不過是給予弟兄們以練習剿匪技術的機會，同時亦給予共匪一個小小的懲處而已，大的勝利還待以後的爭取，我竭誠歡迎新聞界的同志前來觀戰，將我們弟兄們的英勇精神轉告全國同胞。并希將後方同胞們的溫情帶到前綫來」！</p>
<p>記者告別馬團長後，仍坐吉普車回來。</p>

<h3>美國務卿艾契遜正在研究　對蘇外交攤牌策略　認歐陸仍感受侵略威脅　三強代表賡續秘密會談</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕國務卿艾契遜週末加緊工作，研究未來對蘇外交攤牌之策略。艾氏公開警告稱，蘇聯之侵略仍籠罩於歐洲大陸。此種警告殆為艾契遜對本月廿三日巴黎四外長會議準備之要題目，屆時艾氏將與蘇外長維辛斯基面面相對，藉以證明　蘇聯解除柏林封鎖是否已真正改變態度。艾契遜定週末啓程赴巴黎，將與英外相貝文及法外長許曼會談。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十六日電〕英美法三國外長之代表，卽美國傑塞普，英國寇爾貝屈列克，法國巴洛第，將於十六日在此舉行第二次會議，以謀統一三強在外長會議中之政策。三國代表昨舉行第一次會議時，約定會中所談槪不對外宣布，祗各向本國外長提出報告。在討論時所發生之困難點，亦將交由三國外長決定，例如應否使蘇聯參加魯爾管制之問題，英美法三國之意見尚未趨於一致。又據觀察家稱，蘇聯亦深恐在本屆外長會中，遭遇西方三強堅決的陣線，此可由法共領袖社格洛之言證之。杜氏曾謂西方三強將以在德的「旣成事實」對付蘇聯。</p>
<p>〔路透社廣州新貝特福十五日電〕國務院外交學會會長馬杜克今日在此間發表演說稱，柏林封鎖雖已解除，但並未取消蘇聯之侵略威脅，須待蘇聯以其政策及行動，證明蘇聯永遠放棄各種方式的侵略，並與各聯合國合作時，侵略的威脅始能解除。渠指出蘇聯在聯合國中不合作的態度，蘇聯之脅迫伊朗土耳其及希臘，以及共黨之在匈牙利及捷克攫取政權。並曰，幸美國及聯合國及時採取有力行動，始免伊朗等三國受到侵略，並阻止莫斯科之共產主義侵入中歐及西歐。此非美蘇間的爭執，而為世界愛好和平的自由民族與任何侵略者間的問題。</p>
<h3>葛羅米柯率領隨員　離美飛返莫斯科　途經巴黎將小作勾留</h3>
<p>〔合眾社紐約十五日電〕葛羅米柯及蘇方隨員十一人，今日乘飛機啓程前往莫斯科，隨帶行李一千五百廿二磅及大批香檳酒及酒煮嫩雞。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十六日電〕蘇聯外次葛羅米柯今日飛往巴黎，臨行向記者稱：「美蘇兩國人民如屬有意，儘可合作。」記者問柏林封鎖解除後能否使東西雙方之緊張局勢趨於和緩，葛氏答稱：「將來可以決定。吾人必須為和平而努力。」</p>
<p>葛氏係蘇聯駐聯合國首席代表，此次不待聯大閉幕，卽遄返本國，聞有某項任務。據稱：在巴黎僅擬勾留一二日，不預備留至五月廿三日四國外長會議。蘇聯駐聯合國代表任務現由馬立克次長署理。</p>
<h3>聯大全體會　辯論西班牙問題　波蘭指責美政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十六日電〕聯合國大會今日將舉行額外會議一次，表決對西班牙弗朗哥政權恢復外交關係問題。聯大原定十四日閉幕，但因西班牙問題與殖民地問題引起激烈辯論，以致延長會期。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十六日廣播：弗勒興訊，聯合國十六日對弗朗哥問題展開最後一次辯論時，波蘭代表卡茲索基指責艾契遜上週所發表之反弗朗哥聲明「僅係對民主主義之一種口惠。渠指出美國與弗朗哥訂有秘密軍事同盟。</p>
<h3>英在波輪擅捕人　波蘭提抗議</h3>
<p>指為侵犯波主權國旗</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕波蘭大使館今日發表聲明，謂英當局於昨日派警登波蘭輪「巴托利」號捕去共黨領袖艾思勒，為侵犯波蘭的主權國旗及違背國際公認的法律秩序與人權原則。大使館人士並曰：波蘭政府就此事之抗議書，將於十六日向英外交部提出。同時據英外部發言人聲明，波輪「巴托利」號旣泊在英國領海以內，自屬英國管轄，因此英國自有權逮捕任何人犯。且艾思勒之被捕，並不影響渠應否引渡之問題，此一問題尚待法庭決定，以視是否有充份理由可以援用英美間之引渡條約。同時此間之「德國民主英國委員會」已延聘倫敦名律師莫爾為艾思勒辯護。該委員並發表聲明稱，本會之關切艾思勒，非因艾氏為德國人，乃因渠乃反納粹之德籍難民。華沙電臺今日之廣播指艾氏之被捕為蘇格蘭塲人員殘暴的綁票行為。</p>
<h3>英駐蘇大使　彼得遜返國</h3>
<p>繼任人選尚未發表</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕英國駐蘇大使彼得遜，十五日由莫斯科返抵此間。彼氏在外交界服務已卅五載，任駐蘇大使亦已三年，現將退職，遺缺由何人繼任，尚未發表。</p>
<h3>歐洲社會黨大會　在荷蘭揭幕</h3>
<p>出席十七國代表近百人</p>
<p>〔路透社荷蘭巴恩十五日電〕十七國之代表近一百人，今日起在此舉行為期三天之國際社會黨大會。荷蘭社會黨領袖尼特爾斯蒞會致開幕辭，強調在國際社會主義勇敢戒備期間，戰爭決不致發生。上屆社會黨大會，因義左翼社會黨領袖南尼與共黨合作，曾停止其與會資格，一般預料本屆會議將肯定的取消南尼之出席會議資格。義社會黨右翼領袖沙拉迦特仍照常出席本屆會議，同時據悉過去歷屆大會僅討論各國問題，本屆討論將兼及國際事件，如統一歐洲的組織·工業的國際控制·及共同扶助世界自由國家等。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社海牙十六日電〕歐洲社會黨大會今日通過建議案，主張歐洲主要工業全歸公有，此當為支配經濟劃一的歐洲五基本原則之一。其他四原則為，（一）設立歐洲通貨基金準備實行歐洲統一的通貨。（二）設立合作購買機關，訂立購買糧食與原料之長期合同。（三）調整原料之出售。（四）設立歐洲各國間之投資機關。大會又通過建議案，對義國社會黨決議與共黨合作，表示失望，並籲請義社會會成一單獨社會黨而勿與共黨或共產國際情報局作何聯繋。</p>
<h3>華萊士全國演講　倡導和平運動</h3>
<p>極力反對大西洋盟約</p>
<p>〔聯合社柯洛拉杜州屯孚十五日電〕美國進步黨領袖華萊士在全國作和平運動演講，今夜在此勸告人民起而反對北大西洋盟約。華氏稱，吾人昨夜曾在美國西部之落杉機，發起一種革命運動，反抗最大壓迫者北大西洋盟約。現望屯孚人民響應在洛磯山區發起同樣革命運動。余須向諸君警告，此種革命運動，一如所有革命運動，必須有所犧牲。惟諸君如欲更大之安全，必須推翻此盟約。如耗費金錢，以兵力兵器創造世界不安全，卽無社會安全之餘地。如耗費金錢建造兵營，卽無家室之餘地。華氏並在記者招待會稱，希望巴黎四外長會議能成立一種協定，以代替雅爾達及波茨坦協定。波茨坦及雅爾達會議曾產生不少誤會，四輪代表如以人民之利益為懷，應能成立協議，而不犧牲任何國家安全。柏林封鎖之解除，實為良好　兆</p>
<h3>北大西洋安全公約　西班牙西德被擯　艾契遜將出席國會說明</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十五日電〕國務卿艾契遜本週將向國會說明北大西洋公約中，並無西班牙或西德國之地位。艾氏將在國務院之備忘錄中說明此項意見，而重申其前曾數度發表之聲明，以答覆參院外委會中就大西洋公約向艾氏提出之質問。艾氏在大體上將說明西班牙與德國之加入反共聯盟，在軍事觀點上固有戰略價値，但政治上之考慮使此途不能遵循。</p>
<p>預料艾氏本週晤及撥款小組委會討論西班牙與中國問題，並與外委會商討美國對德政策之後，上項備忘錄將於本週杪公佈。艾氏之會晤撥款及外委會，將為渠週四啓程去巴黎出席四強外長會議以前最後一次出現於國會。艾氏在國會中已遭受堅強壓力，促渠恢復對西班牙之全部外交關係，並使弗朗哥政權過於獨裁，要求各節，不能辦到。此次備忘錄中，除非艾氏臨時再作修改，否則將更進一步聲明弗朗哥不能與公約其他簽字國保持密切友善關係。西德國對於保障西歐安全，雖將有若干助力，但其他國家旣不可能使德國加入公約。</p>
<p>艾氏將切實聲明之其他各點如下：（一）大西洋公約規定設置之大西洋委會及防備委會，將草擬互相配合的軍械生產與防禦程序，但不致有在歐洲使用美國軍隊之約束。（二）如果國會通過以軍器供應歐洲之議案，則美國將控制美方供給公約簽字各國全部軍事配備之分配，美方軍器將依照公約簽字各國擬具之合作計劃而運出，任何配備，均不能改用於殖民地戰事，如荷蘭在印尼之糾紛及法國在越南之僵局是。（三）不問巴黎四外長會議結果如何，美參院必須批準大西洋公約，俾向蘇聯表明美國擬保持冷靜與堅定。外委會主席康納利希望於週三結束聽取各方對公約之意見，然康氏不能確定何時將以此約送請批準。康氏欲對此公約提出有利之報告，庶艾契遜出席巴黎會議將得外委會為後盾而地位因之增強。</p>
<h3>東德舉行普選　要求撤佔領軍統一德國為口號　蘇擬藉此加強在外長會中地位</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林十五日電〕東德共黨領袖今日呼召人民於十五及十六兩日投票，造成所謂德國人民大會。東德一千八百萬人民中，至少有一千萬人將投造成票。東德人民大會提議訂立最後和約，迅速撤退全部佔領軍及德國全境統一，頗能迎合德國國家主義。</p>
<p>〔合眾社柏林十五日電〕蘇聯佔區內德國人民十五日在蘇方控制下進行普選，其目的顯在加強蘇聯在巴黎四強外長會議中討價還價的地位。選民僅能就官方決定的「人民議會」一千五百廿五名共黨及親蘇候選人名單，投贊成票或反對票，並無其他相對的候選人。「人民議會」將批準德共草擬的憲法。西方政治觀察家認為蘇外長維辛斯基顯將在四強會議中，主張「人民議會」及其批準的憲法，代表全德國的真正民意，而指斥波恩制憲會議批準的憲法，係由西方帝國主義者指示者」。反共人士指斥此次選舉為「希特勒式」的選舉，並頓促每一東德選民「如果為個人安全而必須投票時」，絕對投反對票。雖然西德禁止此項選舉，但共黨聯合陣線仍提名五千人為西德三佔區及柏林西區的候選人，而列名候選人名單。共黨宣傳機構號召德人投「贊成票，使你們的聲音傳到巴黎去。」</p>
<h3>日兵工廠造船所　大部可保留</h3>
<p>美太平洋艦司令將訪日</p>
<p>〔路透社東京十五日電〕日本協同通訊社稱，美國上週決定停止自日本移取賠償物資後，日本可保留造船所卅八所，每年可造船舶八十萬噸，此等造船所中約有三分之一，係已經指定拆作賠償者。又政府所有兵工廠九十六家中，有大部份亦可望保留。</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京十六日電〕海軍方面宣佈，美太平洋艦隊總司令藍福特上將，將於廿七日抵東京，與遠東海軍司令波克中將會商。藍福特將在某訪問期間，視察橫須賀海軍基地及美國在日本的主要海軍設備。</p>
<h3>南韓外長主締結　太平洋公約</h3>
<p>對尼赫魯言論予以駁斥</p>
<p>〔合眾社漢城十六日電〕南韓外長朴憲永十六日駁斥印度總理尼赫魯的「在亞洲國家間沒有達到穩定時，事實上不可能締結太平洋安全公約」的聲明。朴氏稱：「吾人需要太平洋公約，正因為目前亞洲國家間並不穩定。如果亞洲局勢安全而和平，則已毋需太平洋公約。」「吾人應號召一切亞洲國家的現政府起而協商，協商並非卽作確定性的義務之謂，但太平洋公約問題在現在應予提出及廓清。」渠繼稱：「現在太平洋不啻是一個中心沼澤，一切南美國家均面臨太平洋，墨西哥·加拿大·紐西蘭·澳洲及日本亦均應對太平洋公約採取行動。」</p>
<h3>伊朗向蘇索債</h3>

<h3>利用最大望遠鏡　天象有新發見</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十五日電〕美國「柯利爾」雜誌刋巴洛瑪山天文臺用世界最大望遠鏡攝取之照片若干幀，內有一幀為遙遠星辰區之霾氣，其光線以每秒鐘十八萬六千哩之速度，自紀元前約一千五百年卽已開始向地球發出。另一照片大小與銀河相等之天河，亦係一重大發見，但未言其距離之遠近。此望遠鏡重五百噸，直徑二百吋，其集中力量至大，能攝取細如針頭之一片天空。天文家希望能助其解答關於宇宙之無數謎團，如宇宙是否在炸裂或飛開，卽其一也。巴洛瑪山天文家係用四十八吋之照相機，攝取三億光年以外之星辰，再將其照片一再放大。</p>

<h3>「向貧窮宣戰」　英工黨海外政策目標</h3>
<p>英國工黨對下屆大選所發表的政策宣言中有極重要的一段，是關於海外—對外國。聯邦和殖民地—政策的，題為「世界進步的先鋒」。這一段在粗枝大葉的原則上和某些細節上表示了工黨對現在的見解並其未來計劃和希望。</p>
<p>工黨政府如獲蟬聯，將在海外追求三個最高目的：（一）和平，使聯合國組織能夠達成其所由創立的崇高目標；（二）英國的經濟獨立，英國將繼續領導他國趨向增高的生活標準和「社會發展的更大膽更自由的機會」；（三）「處處對古老的貧窮禍害作無休的戰鬥」。這三個目的是互相有聯銷關係的。</p>
<p>在工黨政府下，英國正在證明計劃和民主並非怨　，國會制度也能迅速行動以改變社會中的權力關係而仍保有言論結社的自由並保護異端。</p>
<p>這一段宣言中列舉蘇聯及其衛星國如何輕蔑合作，於是造成戰爭恐怖，崇害所有人民的和平願望。蘇聯曾拒絕教師和學生的大規模交換，一貫的不理會或破壞波茨坦協定和拒絕簽訂四強防德再起的條約，排斥美國對歐洲的援助，阻遏·囚禁和毀滅民生的社會主義人士，並顯示她對西方民主公約僅在見有強力保護和勇敢防衛時始加尊重。</p>
<p>英國當「蘇聯政權繼續以如此大部分國家資源供應軍用，並推行現有不合作政策時」，不能恢復國防費用的削減。　求集體安全也是事屬必需。</p>
<p>在工黨看來，英國是三大國家集團的公共聯繋，世界和平主要就靠這些國家的兢兢戒備。政府力圖增強這三個互相依賴·互相關聯的集團，其未來的合作大部分繋於唯一屬於所有三大集團的英國。宣言中強詞說，跟蘇聯合作的門戶依舊開着，祗要蘇聯政府願意合作就是了。</p>
<p>歐洲國家間更密切合作的運動是英國自戰事以來所推行政策的極點。沒有趨向更密切統一的進步，西歐國家未有可以期望富強者。英國對西歐聯盟的價値，其重要部分繋於聯邦的支援。沒有英國的週　，西歐聯盟跟聯邦密切相連的基礎恐永遠不能奠定。</p>
<p>英國追求完全經濟獨立的方式已使其可與美國有新的有利的關係，歐洲復興要是沒有美國的援助，大多工作將不可能。「英政府明示決不接受損害抉擇自由的條件而美政府也並未提出這樣條件」。執持這種「聰穎慷慨的見解」美國工會有着極大功勞。</p>
<p>工黨的第三個目的——撲滅貧窮，失業，與近乎包飢饉——已經促成了以下的成績；就是聯合國救濟總署以及歐洲經濟復興計劃紛紛撥予信用借款並給禮物，中東與遠東方面實施新式援助，英國取消食米並實行麵包配給。工黨對於這種已制止廣大地區之飢荒，疾病與崩潰的努力，深感驥倣，而且要「繼續履行世界良好公民的一份責任。」</p>
<p>在過去四年內，四十處殖民地幾乎沒有一處不曾向自治政府的目標推進。工黨對殖民地的經濟政策便是以殖民地急需的資本貨物向殖民地輸出，因而提高殖民地的生產。工黨在各殖民地所設立的公營事業也不少，包括兩個新的企業公司以及東非落花生種植計劃。</p>
<p>此外工黨自戰後又復竭力改進殖民地的工作環境，對於造屋·教育·醫藥預防與研究，以及促進農工業等方面，均曾有巨大計劃。總而言之，英國與她的殖民地已經攜手合作，準備共同剷除無知·貧窮·疾病，並解決有色人種問題。（英國新聞處稿）</p>

<h3>西康人口之謎</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　徐仁常</p>
<p>〔本報雅安六日航訊〕邊遠的西康，人們對它的一切，總是懷着一個謎，卽以人口來說，有說是五百萬，有說是三百萬，還有說一百五十萬的，以最多數五百萬與最少數一百五十萬相比較，其差為三百五十萬，這種差數大到這個程度的原因，一方面西康人口，向無精確統計，許多都是隨便說的，另一方面，有的就西康全境，不分族別，不管行政力量是否達到，一併估計在內的，有的又是除開邊民，單就可能調查的康族漢族來統計的，這兩種方式，都不正確可靠的，因此西康人口之謎，終竟不能揭開。</p>
<p>現在經有關方面，作了一個初步調查統計，可以說為研究邊疆土地與人口問題的寶貴資料，計全省包含十五種族，合計一，九一七，三九七人，男九九九，〇三七人，女九一八，三六〇人，丙中漢族一，一一〇，一八三人，男五五四，九二五人，女五五五，二三一人，分布在寗，雅，康三屬，寗屬十縣局（普格瀘寗二局除外）約佔百分之五十，雅屬六縣，約佔百分之四十，康屬十九縣約佔百分之十，康族一八五，四七七人，男九三，九七六人，女九一，五〇一人，分佈在康屬各縣，藏族四，一七二人，男一，八三七人，女一，三三五人，倮族（黑夷）一八〇，一四四人，男一〇四，七八八人，女七五，五五六人，（瀘寗兩局未編入，）倮族（白夷）一六九，六三四人，男九一，〇二四人，女七八，六一〇人，此種黑白夷，均散居在寗屬各地，水田族二三，七五〇人，男二，二七〇人，婦女一二，四八三人，摩梭族七四，九四六人，男四六，四六一人，女二八，四八五人，居住寗屬各地屬西南各地及巴安等處，　　族四八三人，男二四二人，女二四一人，居住於德昌縣境，番族七一，四五七人，男二八，〇七四人，女四三，三八三人，滿族八二六人，男四五二人，女三七四人，居住於寶興縣境，苗族五，九二五人，男上，五一〇人，女一，八二一人，呷密族一二，三六三人，男五，二一四人，女七，一四九人，黎蘇族五六，七九二人，男三八，九三一人，女一七，八六一人，古宗族三〇，〇〇〇人，男一七，六四六人，女一二，三五四人，以上各族均散居寗屬各縣局，嘉庸族三，一三六人，男一，六二五人，女一，五一一人，僅散居於康定一隅。</p>
<p>西康人口分佈是相當不均勻，雅屬比較富，寗屬比較次之，康屬又次之，據統計人口的結果是這樣，就憑想像也還是如此，但是依自然環境而論，寗屬的氣候溫和，出產豐富，算是康省得天獨厚的地方，人口密度反不如雅屬之多，這其間是有一個邊務問題所在的關係，從前漢人村舍常常被漢人搶刧，所有的人和物，不得不遷移他往，輾轉逃避，就有良田，也荒蕪了，故寗屬的人口，不但無增，反轉一天一天的減少，自建省後，當局運用這個資料，決定政策——三化政策，與漢夷一律平等的原則做去，使漢夷相處相安，至今確是收了相當效果，這也不能不說一個成功。康屬地廣，反為人口最少，從表面上觀察，以為是地高天寒的關係，實則最主要的原因，是康區佛教盛行，喇嘛為特殊階級，不娶妻室，且因喇嘛掌握政教大權，康民多引以為榮，相率送子弟充當喇嘛，所以人口長期不增，或有減無增的，其他因種族複雜，或因婚姻制度不良，或因疾病求諸於神，不知利用醫藥，這都是人口減少的原因，省政當局，在這種情形下的運用，也就在尊重宗教，轉移風氣，這個大原則下去補救他，也是收了不少的效了。</p>
<h3>茶季談皖茶</h3>
<p>— 本報通訊員　董敏</p>
<p>皖南為茶葉產區，尤以「屯綠」「祁紅」馳名國內外，早些年代獨占外匯大宗，至今仍是有地位的出口特產區。十年來，戰亂頻仍，農村經濟凋敝，商業日漸蕭條，倚茶為生的四十萬茶農，以及茶商茶工，一年生活，全恃茶季採取，但是製運商缺乏資金收購毛茶，茶農無力採摘粗揉，況摘下無有受主，自抗戰期間卽仰賴政府貸放經營，一年不貸，一年荒廢，加之過去施貸期間延宕，款到時過，直接影響了產量品質，同時政府貸款對象以茶商為主，大多未曾直放茶農，形成中間經手人剝削煞價的不良現象。茶市關係皖南經濟金融至大，每年農歷清明節前後，茶汎期於焉開始，中秋節前為結束運銷時期，其間約歷二百天，占全年時間五分之三。麥地翻浪，油菜花盛季節，今年茶季已屆，茶農茶商期待茶葉貸款，猶如大旱之望雲霓，地方官署徇各界請求，電催有關國家銀行，迅卽宣示今年茶貸方案，簡化貸放手續，把握時機，以求產量不因而蒙受影響。</p>
<p>皖南產茶區域甚廣，製運則以屯溪，祁門兩地為樞紐點。內銷各省及外銷歐美茶葉，製造裝璜，各不相同。今年外銷茶總產量及產區數字估計如後：</p>
<p>（一）屯綠區：休寗四萬箱，歙縣二萬箱，婺源二萬箱，績溪四千箱，夥縣二千箱，祁門五千箱，旌德二千箱，太平二千箱，涇縣二千箱，共計十萬〇二千箱，每箱以六十斤計算，合六萬一千二百擔。（二）祁紅區：祁門二萬箱，至德三千箱，貴池二千箱，共計二萬五千箱，每箱以五十斤計算，合一萬二千五百擔。總計外銷紅綠茶七萬三千七百擔。</p>
<p>生產成本</p>
<p>本年紅綠茶生產成本，據茶界估計：（一）綠茶在廠成本估計每擔以銀圓一百五十元累算，共需九百十八萬元。（二）紅茶在廠成本估計每擔銀圓二百元，需二百五十萬元。紅綠茶總成本共需一千一百六十八萬銀元，如以七折貸款，共需八百十七萬六千元。貸款種類與時間，共分「初製」「複製」「運銷」三種。屯綠初製貸款宜在「榖雨」以前貸放，複製在「立夏」前貸放。運銷於複製後半個月後貸放。祁紅應在「清明」前貸初製款項，複製貸款於「谷雨」前貸放，複製貸款後半個月施放運銷貸款。紅綠茶貸初複製占十分之四，運銷占十分之六。據茶業界的請求意見，計（一）本年茶貸，應請中央貼見，計（一）本年茶貸，應請中央貼放委員會曁省政府立卽宣示貸款方案及日期。（二）簡化手續。（三）中央茶貸未放之前，應請省府飭省銀行先舉辦信用貸款。（四）皖西茶區業務已經停止，請省府將上年貸款基金移作本年皖南茶業區擴大貸放之用，（五）請省銀行會同貸款之國家銀行合組茶葉貸款團，爭取時效，共同施放。以上旣為茶業界的意見，不過是代表茶商一方面。雖他們未曾說明應該貸給茶商，照以往的現成例子，貸款銀行因茶商有組織，有固定廠址，又至於影響還債限期，並可派員駐廠坐督。反過來說，茶農分布鄉間，人多散漫，又無健全組織，合作社只有一塊招牌，可是政府貸款本意，原是使茶農茶商均沾其利，貸款一股腦兒交給茶商，表面為提高他們的購買力，其實挑茶上門的茶農，往往因成色，品質的計較，賣錢不夠血本，除了忍痛吃虧，別無辦法。因了這種箝制，茶農憤而改秉荒廢茶園的很多。改善貸款方式，似乎是應該改進的，否則一仍舊貫下去，茶農不種茶，茶商無茶可做，國家銀行縱不必再貸茶款，但在外匯上的損失，總是很大的漏洞。</p>
<p>品茗雜話</p>
<p>皖南出產的茶葉，除了紅綠茶出國外，內銷的清茶，大槪大家都知道它；且可說是人人都需要的吧。不過皖南的地方很大，有高山，有低山，有平原，有肥地，有瘦地，當然出的茶葉有好的，有壞的。現在新茶轉眼卽將上市了，筆者也在本談來談談：皖南的清茶最好的產地，首推，太平縣，涇縣，是地產出的茶葉，列於雨前茶，顏色葱綠，其葉肥厚大而直扁，向太陽光看，內藏有暗毛，用開水泡，其芬芳的香氣遂着熱氣浮起，茶汁色清似湖水一般；第二寗國縣績溪縣的地方所產的雨前茶，葉瘦小，色綠而放黃，根根是尖，其毛峰觸目可見，日久退綠變黃現出黑斑，泡而喝之，香味亦佳，不過以舌舐之，頗覺澀嘴，比較太平涇縣茶，稍次一點；第三青陽縣，所產的雨前茶，葉卷如鐵絲，其形彎曲猴環，毛峰浮於其尖頭，顏色黑裏藏暗綠，泡喝亦甚可口，較寗國產的茶葉又要次點；但是地茶葉很出名，因為「九華山」的和尚，常以此茶贈給朝山接綠的香客，所以外埠賣的青陽茶葉，卽說「九華毛峰」的美名，其實並不是珍貴的茶葉；最次要算宣城邊區產的茶葉，其葉看覺頗嫩，用水泡之清湯寡水，喝進口無味，不但沒有香氣，且青草氣異常難聞，但此處新茶出的最早說不定清明前就會長出來，因為它產於平原，易受到陽光曬暖，和春天雨水調和，再加冀灰肥料，因此算它發芽最早，凡是經營茶商的店家，都不收這種貨，所以新茶一登塲時，這時就是茶販機會到了，於是就到這些邊區平山的茶農家買來，在街頭巷尾喊着：「賣新茶葉，賣新茶葉……往往人們見其葉好看，買回家去，泡了一喝，卽知道不好喝，下次卽不買了。</p>

<h3>Land, Sea, and Air Forces Fight All Night: Communist Troops in Yuepu Annihilated; Communist Troops in Nanhui Advance on Shacheng, National Army Has Rushed to Encircle and Suppress; North of Hongqiao and Nan Yuan Areas Cleared</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military sources at 9:00 PM on the 16th: Remnant bandits in Yuepu and the vicinity of Xiao Gu Zhai, after being attacked from the flanks and rear by our defending troops since the morning of the 15th, have become turtles in a jar. As of 2:00 PM yesterday, the invading bandits in the Yuepu area have been completely eliminated. The invading bandits in the Xiao Gu Zhai area have also suffered more than half casualties, with the remnants fleeing westward in disarray. At night, the bandits divided into groups and foolishly attacked our army positions in Shizi Lin, Yuepu, Niujiaojian, and Yangxing. The fierce battle lasted all night. Until dawn today, the bandit army failed to cross the boundary. In total, we captured more than 80 bandits, seized more than 30 rifles, 6 light and heavy machine guns, more than 100 rifles and carbines, and 1 submachine gun. More than 300 bandits below the rank of company commander were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military sources at 9:00 AM on the 16th: (1) At 12:00 midnight on the 15th, the bandits' 28th and 22nd Armies exerted all their strength to attack our Yuepu, Yangxing, and other positions. They charged and fought repeatedly more than seven or eight times. However, our defending troops, maintaining the calm spirit of the past few days, gave the invading bandits a head-on blow. The battle continued until dawn on the 16th, when the bandits' offensive was frustrated and they retreated. Inspection of the abandoned corpses revealed about 3,000 bodies. In this battle, our land, sea, and air forces cooperated, exerting tremendous power. According to reliable information, the bandits suffered at least 6,000 casualties in this attack. By noon, the battle had become quiet. Our army will take advantage of the remaining power of the victory and, under favorable circumstances, dispatch strong troops to counterattack, putting the bandits in a state of exhaustion.</p>
<p>(2) Since the bandit 29th Army launched continuous attacks on the Yuepu and Yangxing positions on the evening of the 12th, they have suffered repeated setbacks and serious losses due to the defending troops' brave killing of the enemy, with most of the soldiers wounded or killed. Since the morning of the 15th, they have been retreating without a trace. The bandit unit number is no longer found, and it is judged that they no longer have the ability to fight and are being reorganized and replenished.</p>
<p>(3) Our unit dispatched a large force to attack the bandit stronghold of Li Jia Lou, west of Liu Jia Hang, at noon on the 15th, killing and wounding more than 600 bandits, capturing more than 100 bandits alive, and seizing 25 rifles and machine guns. The bandits were unable to hold out and fled westward. The battle ended in the evening, so there was no battle on the Liu Jia Hang line all night that day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military sources at 12:00 noon on the 16th: Our army in the Yangxing area, with the cooperation of the air force and artillery, launched a mobile surprise attack on the exhausted bandits at 7:00 this morning, achieving great results. A total of 2 heavy machine guns and more than 30 rifles were captured, and one bandit political commissar and more than 40 soldiers were captured alive. We suffered no losses. Also, a small group of bandit troops that had infiltrated Nan Yuan fled westward after our army counterattacked. Currently, there is no trace of bandits around Nan Yuan. Another piece of news: A portion of the bandit army that had fled north from Nanhui advanced on Shacheng at 2:00 PM on the 15th. We have dispatched a strong force to encircle and suppress them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Shanghai-Song Defense Headquarters announced the battle situation:</p>
<p>(1) The bandits in the Niujiaojian and Yangxing areas launched a fierce attack on our army positions starting at 8:00 PM last night (the 15th). After our frontal troops bravely resisted, an elite unit on the flank was ordered to attack, launching a pincer offensive to fiercely counterattack the invading bandits. The bandit army collapsed and fled across the board, abandoning more than 500 corpses. In this battle, we captured more than 600 bandits, seized 90 rifles, and 9 light machine guns.</p>
<p>(2) Two battalions of the 37th Bandit Army's Guard Regiment launched a probing attack on Qibao at 1:00 this morning. The morale of the defending troops was extremely high, and they concentrated their firepower to bombard the bandits. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. We captured more than 80 bandits. As of press time, the two sides are still in a standoff.</p>
<p>(3) The bandits who fled east along the Qinghu Road were identified as a unit of the 27th Bandit Army. They once advanced on our Nan Yuan (north of Hongqiao Airport) stronghold. After being counterattacked by the local defending troops, they fled in panic, retreating to an area more than ten miles away from Nan Yuan, and there is no movement at the moment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Air Force Headquarters announced: The Great Shanghai Defense Battle entered its fifth day yesterday (the 16th). The Communist army's fierce offensive against Shanghai has been met with bloody resistance from the land, sea, and air forces for four days. In particular, the air force dispatched sorties day and night to bomb their artillery positions and attack their supply units, causing heavy losses to the Communist army. As a result, since the evening of the 15th, except for the fierce battle for Liu Hang on the outer first line of Great Shanghai, most of the Communist army has been in a state of silence. The military judged that the Communist army was making adjustments to its deployment. Yesterday, Shanghai was hit by strong winds and overcast rain, but the air force still braved the adverse weather to carry out the fifth day of battle to defend Great Shanghai, achieving the following results:</p>
<p>(1) The main force of the air force supported the army in the Liu Hang and Yangxing battles outside the Wusong Fortress area. Yuepu and Yangxing were relatively quiet all day yesterday. The Communist army concentrated its efforts to seize Liu Hang, which shields the Dachang Airport. The air force bombed and killed more than 1,000 Communist troops in the villages of Baziqiao, Gujiazai, and Jianqiao near Liu Hang Town. In Yangxing, two artillery positions and five bunker fortifications were destroyed. In the operation to support Liu Hang Town, Liu Hang Town was once attacked by the Communist army. The air force launched fierce bombings in the sky and annihilated most of them, but hundreds of them stubbornly occupied three buildings in Liu Hang Town and refused to retreat. Incendiary bombs were dropped, directly hitting the buildings and setting them on fire. The army then advanced and wiped them all out.</p>
<p>(2) Ambushed more than 1,000 Communist troops coming from Kunshan and going north to Songjiang, blowing up 5 trucks in Weiting.</p>
<p>(3) Bombed and killed more than 500 Communist troops in the outer fortifications of Zhenru.</p>
<p>(4) Destroyed more than 50 wooden boats of the Communist army landing at Bailonggang in the southeast of Chuansha.</p>
<h3>The National Army Has Extremely Favorable Conditions and Has Confidence in Ensuring Shanghai's Safety; Shanghai-Song Garrison Headquarters Receives Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] The Shanghai-Song Garrison Headquarters held a press conference at 3:00 PM on the 16th. Zhang Taixiang, Director of the Political Work Department of the Headquarters, and Deputy Commander Zhou Lixing, analyzed the situation of the defense battle in this city. It is said that the National Army has several favorable conditions for defending Great Shanghai: (1) The defensive fortifications in the four suburbs are extremely strong, and their density is about one-third greater than that of Stalingrad; When Yan Xishan passed through Shanghai, he said that the fortifications in this city were even stronger than those in Taiyuan. (2) The morale of the National Army is high, and its will to fight is firm. One-third of the Communist army are prisoners of war, one-third are new recruits, and only one-third are truly capable of fighting. (3) Public security in the urban area is ensured, and the Garrison Headquarters is determined to suppress riots with force. In addition, this city has convenient transportation, abundant materials, convenient supplies, and sufficient food and fuel for more than half a year. The terrain is favorable for defense with intersecting harbors. The Communist Party's human wave tactics and tunnel warfare tactics are ineffective, so it is believed that there is a certainty of defending the city unless there is an accident. At present, the Communist army on the front line has about six armies, including the 24th, 25th, 26th, 28th, and 29th, which are pressing towards this city from both sides of the Jinghu Road and the Huhang Road. Although their main force has arrived, it has not yet been deployed. According to regular military practice, about a week is needed for attack preparations, so the Communist army's main offensive should be after the 20th of this month. However, the sooner the Communist army launches its general offensive against Shanghai, the greater the mistake it will make. The battle of Shizi Lin and Yuepu is an example. The Communist army attacked wildly and left behind more than 8,000 corpses. Our army's casualties in this battle were only one-twentieth. It is also likened to the Communist army's offensive being like flying a kite, which may be cut off by the National Army at any time, leading to defeat. Furthermore, the waterways in Shanghai are still very smooth, and air transportation is being strengthened, so the supply and transportation of daily necessities for the military and civilians will not be a problem in the future. The current situation is still a prelude, and the main battle has not yet begun. As long as people from all walks of life support the army, there is absolute certainty of ensuring Shanghai's safety.</p>
<h3>Liu Bozhong Talks to Reporters About the Future of the Shanghai-Song Defense Battle</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Yesterday, a reporter visited General Liu Bozhong, Chief of Staff of a high-level command, who received the reporter despite being busy. He said, "The Shanghai-Song Defense Battle is still in the prelude stage. All preparations have been completed long ago and are sufficient to cope with any offensive by the bandits and overcome and crush it." When the reporter asked about strategic issues, he replied with an optimistic attitude, "Strategy is the art of comprehensive application. At present, the close coordination of the land, sea, and air forces is used to deal with the bandit army's one-sided ground offensive, and three-dimensional operations are used to deal with the bandit army's infiltration operations. Moreover, the senior generals responsible for directing the operations this time are all prestigious strategists, and the officers and soldiers of all units are veterans who have fought hundreds of battles and are brave and motivated. Of course, they are confident of defeating the enemy." When the reporter asked about the battle situation in the Yuepu and Yangxing areas, he smiled and said, "What role can a mouse playing around outside an iron cage play? If it sneaks into the iron cage, does the painful consequence need to be said? Please pay attention to the recent situation development and factual performance."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 16th] The situation in northern Fujian has not changed today. The front line is still more than a hundred miles outside Fuzhou. As of the time of dispatch, no war reports have been received. A strong force of the National Army arrived in Gutian on the night of the 15th and completed its deployment on the Gutian and Gukou lines.

<h3>Penghu Has Excellent Public Security: Warships Patrol and Air Force Stationed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 16th] A person from Penghu reported: (1) Penghu still maintains its consistent excellent public order, with petty thieves disappearing and doors not being locked at night. (2) Recently, naval vessels have been patrolling the islands frequently, and the air force has been stationed, making the defense extremely solid. (3) Ships enter and leave Magong Port frequently. According to statistics for April, 152 ships entered and 165 ships exited, not including warships, which is the first time this has happened since the port was opened. (4) There is still a sense of panic about food on the islands. This year's spring drought has caused severe damage to crops, but the fishing industry is very active.</p>
<h3>After the City Falls, Soldiers and Civilians Resist House by House: The Heroic Deeds of Defending Taiyuan; Full Text of Letters and Telegrams from Qi Jingde, Li Ganzhi, and Yan Xishan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Qi Jingde, Director of Inspection of the Shanxi Provincial Government, telegraphed Deputy Director Jia of the Executive Yuan from Xi'an, forwarding a telegram from Director Yan on the 9th, stating: "When the enemy launched the seventh general offensive against Taiyuan on April 9, in addition to the original force of more than 300,000, they also transferred more than 100,000 elite troops from Hebei and Henan, equipped with particularly strong artillery, and used a large amount of poison gas, resulting in particularly heavy casualties among our soldiers and civilians. Soldiers and civilians resisted house by house. Our heroic soldiers and civilians suffered heavy casualties, and almost all houses were destroyed, making it difficult for the Communist bandits to find complete walls to post notices after entering the city. Except for Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Xue Yuxiang, and Ying Shaozhi, the other senior civil and military officials were either captured or committed suicide. The details are not yet known when leaving the city. However, it is known for certain that Liang Huazhi, Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government Committee, and Xu Feng, Chief of the Department; Wu Fuxi, Captain of the Team, and other 120 people collectively took poison and heroically sacrificed themselves after the city fell on the 25th, and set themselves on fire. As of the 26th, many fortifications outside the city continued to resist." Director Yan also received a letter from Li Ganzhi, Administrative Commissioner of the Seventh District, from Xi'an on May 9, describing the final battle in Taiyuan, stating: On May 4, Zhang Kehan, Deputy County Magistrate of Yangqu, escaped and arrived in Shaanxi. He gave a detailed account of our Taiyuan Defense Battle. In addition to instructing the comrade to report in writing, I hereby list the details I have learned: (1) The main force of the bandit army attacking our Taiyuan was about 400,000 people from the three units of Peng Dehuai, Nie Rongzhen, and Xu Xiangqian, and the stretcher team and people carrying coffins were also about 300,000. Their commander was Peng Dehuai. (2) The weapons used by the bandit army included 30 to 40 artillery pieces of various sizes, countless light and heavy machine guns, and most importantly, 15 cm howitzers, poison gas, and tear gas. (3) The bandits launched their offensive against Taiyuan on April 9. The fierce battle lasted until the 19th. The bandits used "human waves," "fire seas," and "gap penetration" tactics, attacking our suburban strongholds on one side and attacking the city fiercely on the other. The fighting was extremely fierce. By the 20th, the bandits were close to the outer moat of the city, and the fighting around the city was unprecedentedly fierce. At that time, the bandit artillery fired at the city with "cold hail" tactics, dropping no less than 50,000 to 60,000 shells every day, incinerating most of our city's fortifications and all buildings. It was difficult for our reserve troops in the city to move. The fighting continued until the 21st and 22nd, when two sections of the city wall near Dabeiguan were breached by the bandits using human wave and fire sea tactics. However, our defending troops bravely resisted, repelled the enemy, and patched up the breaches. At about 5:00 AM on the 24th, a breach was blown open by artillery fire at the Xishu fire area outside the southwest gate of the city. The bandits rushed into the city, and street fighting began. By the morning of the 25th, our army had suffered heavy casualties, and the city fell into the hands of the bandits. The suburban strongholds were not occupied by the bandits until the morning of the 26th. (4) This Taiyuan Defense Battle annihilated about 200,000 bandits, which was truly due to the fact that our heroic officers and soldiers were able to follow your instructions to "defend every inch of land" and "fight for every house," striving hard and making sacrifices. Moreover, our people were able to display a resolute anti-Communist spirit, assisting the army in combat, delivering tea and meals to the officers and soldiers under the rain of bullets, carrying the wounded, building fortifications, and extinguishing fires, demonstrating great power. (5) In this defense battle, in addition to the alarming number of casualties among our officers and soldiers, about 50,000 of our people were killed or wounded. Ninety percent of the public and private buildings in the city have been reduced to ashes. Streets such as Liuxiang, Mao'erxiang, and Hongshipailou have almost no complete houses, only rubble, a desolate sight. (6) Liang Huazhi, Xu Duan, Yin Zundang, Lan Feng, Wu Fuxi, and more than 120 others, upon hearing that the bandits had broken into the city, collectively sacrificed themselves heroically at Liang's mansion (the Special Police and Gendarmerie Command Post). It was also heard that after Liang sacrificed himself, his mansion had become a sea of fire, fulfilling the instruction to make sure that no corpse would be seen by the enemy. (7) Sun, Wang, Xue, and Wu were all captured by the bandits. The bandits insulted Wang in every way, and his face was beaten black and blue. When he was escorted to Yuci, several bandit soldiers lifted Wang from the ground and threw him onto the car, a very miserable sight."</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Committee Reviews the Simplification of County-Level Organizations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] The Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee and the Legal Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a preliminary joint review meeting on the revision of the County Organization Law, which aims to simplify the county-level administrative organizations, at 9:00 AM on the 16th. Zhang Mingjing presided over the meeting. After review, it was considered that: (1) During this extraordinary period, the existing "Military Section" and "Accounting Office" of the county-level administrative organizations should still be retained in principle; (2) The other sections and offices are not clearly defined in the current County Organization Law, and only the outline of the county-level organization is stipulated, but the outline has not gone through legislative procedures, so how to amend it should be decided after the "General Rules on Provincial and County Autonomy" currently under review by this Yuan are passed.</p>

<h3>Land Reform in Southwestern Fujian Achieves Good Results After Implementation; Increased Agricultural Income and Improved Social Order</h3>
<p>[United States News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th] Southwestern Fujian has recorded the acceptance of economic assistance from the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction and the implementation of land reform and rural reconstruction plans. This is an example of using US dollars to help Chinese farmers practice self-help.</p>
<p>The Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction was established in accordance with the China Aid Act of 1948 to assist the rural areas of China in implementing reconstruction plans. The funds to continue this plan are included in the funds for extending economic aid to China, which Congress approved last month. The new bill allows the Economic Cooperation Administration and the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction to use $54,000,000 until February 1, 1950, according to the above funds, which are the funds that were originally under the China Aid Act but have not yet been used.</p>
<p>The Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction estimates that the commission will receive approximately $15,000,000 of the total amount to assist in the implementation of local rural reconstruction plans in the coming year.</p>
<p>Of this amount, $95,926 has been allocated to projects in Fujian to transfer land ownership to those who actually cultivate it, complete four irrigation projects to increase agricultural production, and establish a rural credit loan. The funds will be allocated as follows: $39,000 to implement land reform in six districts of southwestern Fujian, $36,926 to complete four irrigation projects in the Longyan district, and $20,000 as credit loans to farmers in Longyan. To date, the local authorities in the district have received $20,000.</p>
<p>The $39,000 for land reform will assist local authorities in Shanghang, Yongding, Wuping, Liancheng, Zhangping, and Changting to acquire land for distribution to landless farmers. The funds will be used to assist local governments in conducting necessary land surveys to determine the basis for land distribution. The land is acquired by the government in accordance with the power of eminent domain and transferred to farmers after they pay 250 percent of the average of the land rent for the most recent three years.</p>
<p>The $36,926 allocated by the commission for irrigating Longyan will help complete the two projects currently underway in Tanghe, Denggang, Xiaoyang, and Guangba (transliteration). Farmers will be able to repay the funds after the irrigation facilities are expanded and grain harvests increase. These repaid funds will be used to establish a revolving fund to implement other projects and promote the interests of farmers in the area.</p>
<p>The $20,000 rural credit loan will be used to purchase fertilizer, water buffalo, and provide relief to farmers suffering from high-interest loans (the commission funds are grants and do not bear interest). The commission funds will also be used to purchase improved seeds, insecticides, and plant protectants, as well as better breeds of pigs. Local government agencies in Longyan will also raise an equal amount of funds to make a total of $40,000. The land reform plan currently being implemented in Longyan has become a model that can be followed by projects launched by the commission in nearby areas. In Longyan, only actual cultivators may be allocated land, with the exception of landowners who are urgently dependent on the land for their livelihoods, such as widows or the elderly. They may temporarily retain their land ownership until their need for income no longer exists, at which time the land will be transferred to tenants. The government uses the power of eminent domain to acquire land and compensate the owners according to the land value.</p>
<p>The land is allocated according to the number of people in the family. Families of four or fewer can receive 12 to 20 mu, and families with more than four people can receive 25 percent more land for each person exceeding four (the calculation standard is that each mu can produce one dan of brown rice per year). Cultivators may not acquire more land by purchase in the future.</p>
<p>Longyan's land reform plan is sufficient to achieve one of the main goals of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, that is, the reconstruction obtained from this plan will belong to the people rather than to a few. Longyan has a population of approximately 140,000 people, of whom 120,000 are farmers.</p>
<p>The survey of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction shows that this plan has already produced significant benefits in improving living conditions. Agricultural income has increased, and rural capital has also increased. In short, farmers now have enough food to eat, which was not the case in the past. Most farmers can now wear modern clothes, whereas in the past, most of them wore rags. Most of the dilapidated houses have now been replaced with new or repaired houses, and it is estimated that the overall standard of living has increased by 20 percent.</p>
<p>Agricultural income has also increased by a percentage equivalent to the above.</p>
<p>Investigators from the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction also reported that order in the area has greatly improved, there are no beggars in the area, there are very few cases of theft, and land disputes in towns, which previously accounted for 43 percent of lawsuits, now account for only 8 percent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, farmers are proud to be able to cultivate their own land, so communism has no persuasive effect. The survey results show that there is no Communist Party activity in the area—although the Communist Party is very active in the surrounding areas. Moreover, the only enemies of the plan are the Labour Party members active on the Guangdong border.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li Sends Telegram to Congratulate Norway's National Day</h3>

<h3>Traffic Between Hong Kong and Shanghai May Be Cut Off at Any Time</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 16th] Traffic between Hong Kong and Shanghai may be cut off at any time.

<h3>Song Ziwen Departs for France: Took a Plane from Hong Kong to Bangkok Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 16th] Song Ziwen took a Pan American Airlines plane to Bangkok at 4 PM on the 16th, and will then continue on to Paris. A special police unit was present at the airport to provide strict security. A friend and a servant accompanied him. Before his departure, he met with reporters and denied rumors circulating that this trip was to purchase military supplies. He stated that the sole purpose of his trip was to recuperate, and that he was carrying an ordinary passport, not a diplomatic passport, so he was traveling purely in a private capacity. When reporters asked about the recent proposal passed by the National Government requesting him, Kong Xiangxi, and Zhang Jiaao to lend the government 1 billion US dollars for war expenses, Song replied: "This is merely a suggestion from the Legislative Yuan." Song also confirmed that the National Government only has 500 million US dollars remaining in foreign accounts. According to well-informed sources, after arriving in France, Mr. Song will reside in Aix-les-Bains, and may later travel to Switzerland, but currently does not intend to go to the United States.</p>

<h3>Bai Chongxi Presides Over Changsha Command Post: Actively Completing New Deployments: Planned Withdrawal from Wuhan Completed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 16th] A spokesman for the Central China Commander-in-Chief's Office said: Due to strategic considerations, the Supreme Command of Central China has ordered the Wuhan garrison to make a planned withdrawal from the three towns of Wuhan, a military stronghold in Central China. General Bai Chongxi, Chief of the Central China Military and Political Affairs, flew from Guangzhou to Wuhan on the 13th of this month to personally supervise the withdrawal. By the 15th, all of our defending troops and all military supplies had been proactively withdrawn from Wuhan according to plan. The few defensive troops in Hankou also crossed the river yesterday to reach Wuchang and continue moving south. Only a small number of unusable broken tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles, totaling about sixty, remained there. Chief Bai left Wuhan at about 12:00 noon on the 15th, leading his staff to fly to Changsha, where he presides over the Changsha Command Post of the Office and actively completes new operational deployments. In addition, before leaving Wuhan, Mr. Bai summoned Wuhan elders Kong Geng and Geng Boxiao and instructed them to be responsible for directing local people's self-defense teams to assist the police in maintaining local order and to strictly prevent harassment by unscrupulous elements. The discipline of the National Army during this withdrawal from Wuhan was very good. All public utilities and equipment were preserved in accordance with orders. As for the maintenance of a considerable flood level in the Wutai and other sluices for military purposes, the water stored in the sluices has now been released to benefit people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Peace in Beiping (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>He even pretended not to have heard of the name "Fu Yisheng," insisting that "Chuan" be written as "Yi." He repeatedly emphasized that the reason they had not entered the city yet was not because they could not capture it, but because they feared destroying this ancient cultural capital. He further emphasized that everyone should recognize that it was not Fu Zuoyi who protected the city of Beiping, but the city of Beiping that protected Fu Zuoyi. If he remained obstinate, then the responsibility for destroying Beiping would not be placed on the account of the Communist army. He started by saying: To negotiate peace, you must first agree to the eight conditions proposed by Chairman Mao, otherwise there is no point in talking. After the representatives heard his high opinion, He Siyuan was the first to agree to 9.9 of the eight conditions, believing that there were no problems with the others, except that Fu's name should be removed from the list of war criminals. Other representatives believed that he had agreed too readily, saying that we are people's representatives, and our task is only to open the door to peace. As for the conditions, we hope that the two sides will talk directly. Several times the conclusion was to ask the two sides to negotiate directly. They stayed overnight and returned to the city the next afternoon, having been treated to two extremely rich banquets, accompanied by the famous Hai Dian Ren He Zhan Lotus White wine. The representatives had not tasted meat for more than a month in the city, and they were all happy to overeat. Later, it was rumored that someone got drunk, but that was not the case. Before returning to the city, the Communist side's condition was that the negotiations should not be revealed in the newspapers, so after returning to the city, all ten representatives kept their mouths shut, and their daily task was to avoid journalists. Therefore, very few people know the details mentioned above.</p>
<p>As for the military's peace negotiations, Mr. Fu always kept his mouth shut. Even his close aides, the Hebei Chairman Chu Qingbo and the Deputy Secretary-General of the Pacification Headquarters, often complained that he did not reveal a single word. One can imagine how others felt. From various clues after the fact, it seems that Mr. Fu's private representatives were Deng, Guo Zongfen, Zhou Beifeng, Qin Fengchuan, and Cui Zaizhi. Before the peace treaty was signed, they repeatedly met with Lin Biao, Ye Jianying, Nie Rongzhen, etc., and finally signed an agreement of twenty-five articles on January 22, but only thirteen articles were published in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(6) One Day of Jubilation</p>
<p>The people of Beiping have experienced vicissitudes of life and suffered many sorrows. Their worldliness is unparalleled. Therefore, apart from being forced to perform genuine jubilation like American children, it is difficult to encounter. I am from Lugouqiao, very close to Beiping. In my memory, there have only been three events that can be called city-wide jubilation. The first time was on December 25, 1936, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek escaped from Xi'an. At that time, the people of Beiping had been bullied by Japan for more than forty years since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. Especially after the September 18 Incident, the East Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Council was right in front of them, and the Japanese and Korean hooligans made trouble unreasonably, oppressing the people to the point of suffocation. Their only hope was to resist Japan, but the central force of resistance against Japan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, was in distress. What other hope was there! After thirteen days of depression, they suddenly heard that he had escaped from danger. How could they not rejoice? This was the first time. The second time was the victory in 1945. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, Beiping was the first to fall. After eight years of trampling by the invaders, once the country won victory, people were truly overjoyed. This was the second time. The third time was this year's January 23. Beiping had been besieged for forty days since December 14 of last year. During these forty days, although the people of Beiping remained calm and order was maintained, it was like the tranquility of a person about to die. What was the use of being anxious? Everyone already knew the example of Xinbao'an. If tens of thousands of shells were fired again, Beiping would inevitably follow in the footsteps of Xinbao'an. When humanity reaches its most dangerous moment, it instinctively seeks not to die. Now that the peace treaty has been signed on January 22, at least they can avoid dying for the time being. It is just like a person who has escaped death. What words can be used to describe their jubilation? Moreover, having escaped death, they can also celebrate the New Year in peace. What could be more joyful than this? On that day, prices plummeted, even more drastically than in the year of victory. The price of silver dollars the previous day was 360 yuan in gold certificates, but that day it fell to 180. Pork, which originally sold for four catties of silver dollars on the spot, now sold for four catties for one silver dollar. All other prices dropped by at least half. Escaping death and celebrating a peaceful New Year, relieving the pressure of prices, was truly like having both blessings and longevity. I don't think even a writer like me can describe the happy mood of the people of Beiping that day.</p>
<p>But the most tragic thing is that good times don't last long, and feasts are hard to repeat. The people of Beiping must still have committed grave sins, and their great calamity has not yet been fulfilled. The day of jubilation only lasted for one day. It only lasted for one day, and on the 24th, things went wrong. Perhaps after excessive jubilation, people regained some reason and thought that the thirteen articles of peace were not peace but surrender. As a result, prices rose again, and they rose very quickly. The silver dollar is the standard of prices. On the 24th, it rose to 280, on the 25th, it rose back to 360, and on the 26th, it rose to 480, which was more expensive than during the siege. With such a large increase, it had risen to over 1,000 by February 1. In addition, social order was greatly disrupted, and at least five or six robberies occurred every day. Illusions were persuaded by reality, and people all raised their heads again. But people always place their hopes on the future. If this year is not good, they hope that luck will change next year. If luck is not good, they hope to get rich when they have nasal luck. If this life is not good, they hope to go to heaven in the next life. If this government is not good, they hope that the next government will be perfect, and they always imagine the future or the environment they have experienced as perfect. Optimists say that this is a normal phenomenon during the transition between two regimes, and things will be better after the joint institutions are established on February 1 and the Liberation Army enters the city. But what is the reality? Let's see! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Visiting the Luodian Front Line</h3>
<p>— Zhao He</p>
<p>The area from Jiading northwards to Baoshan in the east is the throat of Shanghai, a vital strategic location. It is said that the National Army guarding this area is a powerful unit that has shown its prowess on weak battlefields.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9 AM, the reporter took a jeep to visit the Luodian front line. Along the way, trenches crisscrossed and bunkers were scattered everywhere. The inspections along the way were extremely strict, almost every five steps there was a post, and every ten steps there was a sentry. After multiple interrogations, the reporter finally arrived at Luodian at 11 AM. When inquiring about the address of the commanding officer of the ×× unit responsible for this defense line from armed comrades, everyone replied in unison, "I don't know!" This made the reporter very embarrassed. Later, a plainclothes person (who later turned out to be a political worker of the unit) came forward, clarified everything to the reporter, and after several turns, finally met the Ma Regiment Commander of the unit. Upon meeting, the Regiment Commander shook hands warmly and repeatedly said: "Welcome!" "But it's not easy for you to come to this place!" The reporter then asked the soldiers on the street if they belonged to his unit, and why they all replied "I don't know" when asked about the address of the commanding officer. Mr. Ma smiled and said: "This is the secret to our 'secrecy'! When you ask this and that on the street, we already know. The plainclothes personnel are sent from here, and the common people will report to this unit whenever they see unfamiliar faces. You have a very good opportunity today, and I have good news to tell you. Now, let Liu, the cadre, talk to you in the next room."</p>
<p>The reporter then followed Cadre Liu to another room to chat. Cadre Liu told many facts that he considered unremarkable but were surprising to the reporter. He said: "The political workers of this unit have a very high status and heavy responsibilities. They are very strict in organizing and training the people, and the education of the soldiers is also extremely thorough. On the 6th of this month, when our 6th Battalion was ordered to go to the Liuhe area for guerrilla warfare, because it was necessary to go to the Fuqiao area to scout the terrain and bandit situation, the deputy instructor of the team, Shi Wenjie, volunteered to disguise himself and go with a comrade. When they arrived at Liuliqiao in Qianjin Township and walked about a mile or so towards Fuqiao, many bandit soldiers suddenly rushed out of the wheat field. When they were escorting the two of them to the bandit's den, our elusive brothers intercepted the bandits at this time. Shi Wenjie ran back to the original formation during the gunfire between the two sides. The bandits could not withstand our firepower and fled in all directions. Our brave brothers captured sixteen bandits alive and returned victoriously." He continued: "Because we are very serious about rectifying military discipline, in addition to plainclothes political workers patrolling at all times, we also reward the people for reporting. Moreover, because we strictly adhere to integrity with the people, the assistance we receive from the people is really too great. If we can make good use of the people's power in future suppression work, it will definitely accelerate the arrival of our victory!"</p>
<p>While the reporter was chatting with Cadre Liu, the situation in the Regiment Commander's office next door seemed very tense and excited. The phone rang constantly, and the Regiment Commander's instructions, "Be vigilant!" "Wipe them out quickly!" "Capture them alive as much as possible!..." "Good! Good!" came out of the Regiment Commander's office from time to time. The reporter's emotions also became tense.</p>
<p>After about an hour, a messenger asked the reporter to go to the Regiment Commander's office. The Regiment Commander had a smile on his face and told the reporter in an excited tone about the battle of the 3rd Company of the Regiment's surprise attack on the Liduqiao north of Jiading today: "The 86th Division of the Communist 28th Army came from the Zhitang area on the 6th, trying to harass Jiading and destroy the Shanghai-Taihang Highway. Its search company was stationed in Liduqiao. This Regiment gave it close surveillance, waiting for an opportunity to attack. The bandit army was extremely alert, making it difficult to understand our deployment. They had not taken action for a long time. This Regiment realized that the bandits were cautious in guarding at night but careless during the day. It sent two platoons of the 3rd Company and two squads of the 2nd Company, under the unified command of Han Guojun, the Company Commander of the 3rd Company, to set off at dawn today. One platoon in plain clothes was in front, and the rest followed, rushing towards Liduqiao.</p>
<p>"Meng Jilan, a private first class of the 3rd Company, crawled forward for about a mile through the wheat field to the vicinity of the bridgehead. He saw the bandit sentry pacing back and forth in a figure-eight pattern at the bridgehead, completely unaware. Taking advantage of when he turned around, he jumped up from the field without being noticed and tightly hugged the bandit sentry. Under Sergeant Liu Zhiqing, the squad leader, immediately rushed forward and disarmed the bandit's gun. At that time, the village was still indifferent. He was forced to reveal the bandit's situation and immediately reported to the company commander and platoon leader to quickly bring the team forward. Meng Xiulan handed the bandit sentry over to Liu Zhiqing to guard, and personally entered the village with a submachine gun. He found more than a dozen bandits eating in the courtyard next door, and immediately shot and killed three bandits. Turning around the corner of the house, he finished off another one. At this time, Du Zhen, the second lieutenant platoon leader of the 2nd Company, had led two squads of brothers to rush into Liduqiao at lightning speed. The bandit unit suspected that soldiers had fallen from the sky, and they were flustered and at a loss, and fled north in panic. It is estimated that the bandits left behind eighteen bodies, captured more than ten bandits, seized three rifles, one pistol, two horses, and one telegraph machine, etc." Finally, the Regiment Commander told the reporter in a firm tone: "This raid was just to give the brothers a chance to practice bandit suppression skills, and it was also a small punishment for the Communist bandits. Bigger victories are still to be won in the future. I sincerely welcome comrades from the press to come and watch the battle and convey the heroic spirit of our brothers to the compatriots of the whole country. I also hope to bring the warmth of the compatriots in the rear to the front line!"</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to the Ma Regiment Commander, the reporter returned in a jeep.</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of State Acheson is Studying Strategies for a Diplomatic Showdown with the Soviet Union: Believes Europe Still Feels the Threat of Aggression: Representatives of the Three Powers Continue Secret Talks</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Acheson worked overtime over the weekend to study future strategies for a diplomatic showdown with the Soviet Union. Acheson publicly warned that Soviet aggression still looms over the European continent. This warning is Acheson's main topic in preparation for the four-power foreign ministers' meeting in Paris on the 23rd of this month, at which time Acheson will face Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky in an attempt to prove whether the Soviet Union's lifting of the Berlin blockade has truly changed its attitude. Acheson is scheduled to depart for Paris over the weekend, where he will meet with British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Schuman.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th] The representatives of the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, namely Jessup of the United States, Colville of the United Kingdom, and Ballot of France, will hold their second meeting here on the 16th to discuss unifying the policies of the three powers in the foreign ministers' meeting. The representatives of the three countries held their first meeting yesterday and agreed that everything discussed in the meeting would not be announced to the outside world, but each would submit a report to their respective foreign ministers. The difficult points that arise in the discussion will also be decided by the foreign ministers of the three countries, such as the question of whether the Soviet Union should participate in the control of the Ruhr, on which the opinions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have not yet converged. According to observers, the Soviet Union is also deeply afraid of encountering a firm front from the Western three powers at this foreign ministers' meeting, as evidenced by the words of French Communist leader Thorez. Thorez said that the Western three powers would use the "fait accompli" in Germany to deal with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Bedford, Guangzhou, 15th] Maddox, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, said here today that although the Berlin blockade has been lifted, it has not eliminated the Soviet Union's threat of aggression. The threat of aggression can only be eliminated when the Soviet Union proves by its policies and actions that it has permanently abandoned all forms of aggression and cooperates with the United Nations. He pointed out the Soviet Union's uncooperative attitude in the United Nations, the Soviet Union's coercion of Iran, Turkey, and Greece, and the Communist Party's seizure of power in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. He also said that fortunately, the United States and the United Nations took timely and forceful action to prevent the three countries, including Iran, from being invaded, and to prevent Moscow's communism from invading Central and Western Europe. This is not a dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union, but a problem between the free nations of the world who love peace and any aggressor.</p>
<h3>Gromyko Leads Entourage: Departs from the United States to Return to Moscow: Will Stay Briefly While Passing Through Paris</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 15th] Gromyko and his eleven-member Soviet entourage departed by plane for Moscow today, carrying 1,522 pounds of luggage and a large quantity of champagne and chicken stewed in wine.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 16th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko flew to Paris today. Before leaving, he told reporters: "If the people of the United States and the Soviet Union are willing, they can cooperate." When reporters asked whether the lifting of the Berlin blockade could ease the tensions between the East and West, Gromyko replied: "The future can decide. We must work for peace."</p>
<p>Gromyko is the chief representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations. This time, he returned to his country without waiting for the end of the General Assembly. It is said that he has a certain mission. It is said that he only plans to stay in Paris for one or two days and does not plan to stay until the four-power foreign ministers' meeting on May 23. The duties of the Soviet representative to the United Nations are now being handled by Deputy Minister Malik.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly: Debates the Spanish Question: Poland Accuses U.S. Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 16th] The United Nations General Assembly will hold an extra meeting today to vote on the question of restoring diplomatic relations with the Franco regime in Spain. The General Assembly was originally scheduled to close on the 14th, but the session has been extended due to heated debates over the Spanish question and colonial issues.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] New York, 16th Broadcast: Flushing News, when the United Nations held a final debate on the Franco question on the 16th, Polish representative Katz Sozai criticized Acheson's anti-Franco statement last week as "merely lip service to democracy." He pointed out that the United States has a secret military alliance with Franco.</p>
<h3>British Authorities Illegally Arrest a Person on a Polish Ship: Poland Lodges a Protest</h3>
<p>Claiming It Violates Polish Sovereignty and the National Flag</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The Polish Embassy issued a statement today stating that the British authorities sent police to board the Polish ship "Batory" yesterday to arrest Communist leader Eisler, which violated Poland's sovereignty, national flag, and the internationally recognized legal order and principles of human rights. Embassy officials also said: The Polish government's protest letter on this matter will be submitted to the British Foreign Office on the 16th. At the same time, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated that since the Polish ship "Batory" was docked within British territorial waters, it was under British jurisdiction. Therefore, Britain has the right to arrest any criminal. Furthermore, Eisler's arrest does not affect the question of whether he should be extradited. This question will be decided by the court to see if there are sufficient reasons to invoke the extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and the United States. At the same time, the "German Democratic British Committee" here has hired London's famous lawyer Moore to defend Eisler. The committee also issued a statement saying that the committee's concern for Eisler is not because Eisler is German, but because he is a German refugee who is anti-Nazi. Warsaw Radio's broadcast today referred to Eisler's arrest as a brutal kidnapping by Scotland Yard personnel.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to the Soviet Union: Peterson Returns Home</h3>
<p>Successor Has Not Yet Been Announced</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson returned here from Moscow on the 15th. Mr. Peterson has served in the diplomatic service for 35 years and has been Ambassador to the Soviet Union for three years. He is now retiring, and who will succeed him has not yet been announced.</p>
<h3>European Socialist Congress Opens in the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Nearly 100 Representatives from 17 Countries Attend</p>
<p>[Reuters, Baarn, Netherlands, 15th] Nearly one hundred representatives from seventeen countries began a three-day International Socialist Congress here today. Dutch Socialist leader Nittelss delivered the opening address, emphasizing that war will never occur during the brave vigilance of international socialism. At the last Socialist Congress, the Italian leftist Socialist leader Nanni was suspended due to his cooperation with the Communist Party, and it is generally expected that this session will definitively revoke Nanni's eligibility to attend. Italian Socialist right-wing leader Saragat is still attending this session as usual. It is also reported that past congresses only discussed national issues, while this session will also cover international events, such as the organization of a unified Europe, international control of industry, and joint assistance to free countries of the world.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 16th] The European Socialist Congress today passed a proposal advocating that the major industries of Europe should all be publicly owned. This should be one of the five basic principles governing a unified European economy. The other four principles are: (1) Establishing a European Monetary Fund to prepare for the implementation of a unified European currency. (2) Establishing a cooperative purchasing agency to establish long-term contracts for the purchase of food and raw materials. (3) Adjusting the sale of raw materials. (4) Establishing an investment agency among European countries. The Congress also passed a proposal expressing disappointment at the Italian Socialist Party's decision to cooperate with the Communist Party, and calling on the Italian Socialist Party to become a separate Socialist Party and not to have any connection with the Communist Party or the Cominform.</p>
<h3>Wallace's National Speech Advocates Peace Movement</h3>
<p>Strongly Opposes the Atlantic Pact</p>
<p>[United Press, Denver, Colorado, 15th] Progressive Party leader Wallace gave a nationwide speech on the peace movement, advising the people tonight to rise up and oppose the North Atlantic Treaty. Wallace stated, "Last night, we launched a revolutionary movement in Los Angeles, in the American West, to resist the greatest oppressor, the North Atlantic Treaty. Now, we hope that the people of Denver will respond and launch a similar revolutionary movement in the Rocky Mountains. I must warn you that this revolutionary movement, like all revolutionary movements, will require some sacrifice. But if you want greater security, you must overthrow this treaty. If money is spent to create insecurity in the world with military force and weapons, there will be no room for social security. If money is spent to build barracks, there will be no room for families." Wallace also stated at a press conference that he hoped the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference could establish an agreement to replace the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. The Potsdam and Yalta conferences produced many misunderstandings. If the four representatives have the interests of the people at heart, they should be able to reach an agreement without sacrificing the security of any country. The lifting of the Berlin blockade is a good sign.</p>
<h3>North Atlantic Security Treaty: Spain and West Germany Excluded; Acheson to Explain to Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] Secretary of State Acheson will explain to Congress this week that Spain or West Germany have no place in the North Atlantic Treaty. Acheson will state this opinion in a memorandum from the State Department, reiterating statements he has made several times before, in response to questions raised by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the Atlantic Treaty. Acheson will generally explain that while the inclusion of Spain and Germany in the anti-communist alliance has strategic value from a military perspective, political considerations make this path impossible to follow.</p>
<p>It is expected that Acheson's memorandum will be released at the end of this week, after he meets with the Appropriations Subcommittee to discuss Spain and China, and with the Foreign Relations Committee to discuss US policy towards Germany. Acheson's meetings with the Appropriations and Foreign Relations Committees will be his last appearance before Congress before he departs for Paris on Thursday to attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Acheson has been under strong pressure in Congress to restore full diplomatic relations with Spain, but the requirements for the Franco regime are too dictatorial to be met. Unless Acheson makes further amendments, this memorandum will further state that Franco cannot maintain close and friendly relations with the other signatories of the treaty. Although West Germany will contribute to the security of Western Europe, it is impossible for other countries to bring Germany into the treaty.</p>
<p>Other points that Acheson will emphatically state are as follows: (1) The Atlantic Committee and the Defense Committee established by the Atlantic Treaty will draft mutually coordinated armament production and defense procedures, but without any obligation to use American troops in Europe. (2) If Congress passes a bill to supply Europe with military equipment, the United States will control the distribution of all military equipment supplied by the US to the signatories of the treaty. US military equipment will be shipped according to the cooperative plans formulated by the signatories of the treaty. No equipment may be diverted for use in colonial wars, such as the conflict in Indonesia with the Netherlands and the stalemate in Vietnam with France. (3) Regardless of the outcome of the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the US Senate must ratify the Atlantic Treaty to show the Soviet Union that the United States intends to remain calm and firm. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally hopes to conclude hearing opinions on the treaty on Wednesday, but Connally cannot determine when the treaty will be submitted for approval. Connally wants to issue a favorable report on this treaty so that Acheson's position will be strengthened by the support of the Foreign Relations Committee when he attends the Paris Conference.</p>
<h3>East Germany Holds General Election: "Withdraw Occupation Forces and Unify Germany" as Slogan; USSR Plans to Strengthen its Position at Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 15th] East German Communist leaders today called on the people to vote on the 15th and 16th to create a so-called German People's Congress. At least ten million of East Germany's eighteen million people will cast ballots. The East German People's Congress proposes to conclude a final peace treaty, quickly withdraw all occupation forces, and unify the entire German territory, which is quite appealing to German nationalism.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 15th] The German people in the Soviet occupation zone are conducting a general election under Soviet control on the 15th, the purpose of which is obviously to strengthen the Soviet Union's bargaining position at the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Voters can only cast a yes or no vote for the official "People's Council" list of 1,525 Communist and pro-Soviet candidates, with no other alternative candidates. The "People's Council" will approve the constitution drafted by the German Communist Party. Western political observers believe that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will clearly argue at the Four-Power Conference that the "People's Council" and the constitution it approves represent the true public opinion of all of Germany, and will denounce the constitution approved by the Bonn Constitutional Assembly as being dictated by Western imperialists. Anti-communists denounce this election as a "Hitler-style" election and urge every East German voter to cast a no vote "if they must vote for personal safety." Although West Germany prohibits this election, the Communist United Front has nominated 5,000 people as candidates for the three occupation zones of West Germany and the western sector of Berlin, and has listed the names of the candidates. The Communist propaganda machine calls on Germans to vote "yes so that your voice can be heard in Paris."</p>
<h3>Most Japanese Ordnance Factories and Shipyards Can Be Retained</h3>
<p>US Pacific Fleet Commander to Visit Japan</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 15th] The Japan Cooperative News Agency stated that after the United States decided last week to stop removing reparations materials from Japan, Japan can retain 38 shipyards, capable of building 800,000 tons of ships annually. About one-third of these shipyards have already been designated for dismantling as reparations. Also, most of the 96 government-owned ordnance factories are expected to be retained.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Naval officials announced that Admiral Radford, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, will arrive in Tokyo on the 27th to meet with Vice Admiral Bogk, Commander of the Far East Naval Forces. During his visit, Radford will inspect the Yokosuka Naval Base and the main US naval facilities in Japan.</p>
<h3>South Korean Foreign Minister Advocates Conclusion of Pacific Pact</h3>
<p>Rejects Nehru's Remarks</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 16th] South Korean Foreign Minister Park Heon-young on the 16th refuted Indian Prime Minister Nehru's statement that "it is practically impossible to conclude a Pacific Security Pact until stability is achieved among Asian countries." Park stated: "We need a Pacific Pact precisely because Asian countries are currently unstable. If the Asian situation were safe and peaceful, there would be no need for a Pacific Pact." "We should call on the current governments of all Asian countries to negotiate. Negotiation does not mean making definite obligations, but the issue of a Pacific Pact should be raised and clarified now." He continued: "The Pacific is now nothing more than a central swamp. All South American countries face the Pacific, and Mexico, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan should also take action on the Pacific Pact."</p>
<h3>Iran Demands Debt from USSR</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 15th] Iranian Foreign Minister Haikmat declared today that Iran has formally requested the Soviet Union to repay 12 tons of gold and nearly $9 million in debt owed to Iran since World War II. This is the cost of wartime Iranian supplies and services to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has never explained its reasons for refusing payment. Haikmat also stated that this attitude of the Soviet Union makes it impossible to conclude a trade agreement between the two countries.</p>
<h3>New Discoveries in the Heavens Using the Largest Telescope</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] The American magazine "Collier's" published several photos taken by the Palomar Mountain Observatory using the world's largest telescope. One photo shows a haze in a distant star region, the light from which began to be emitted to Earth from around 1500 BC at a speed of 186,000 miles per second. Another photo, a galaxy the size of the Milky Way, is also a major discovery, but its distance is not mentioned. This telescope weighs 500 tons and has a diameter of 200 inches. Its focusing power is so great that it can capture a piece of sky as small as the head of a needle. Astronomers hope that it will help them answer countless mysteries about the universe, such as whether the universe is exploding or flying apart. Palomar Mountain astronomers used a 48-inch camera to capture stars 300 million light-years away and then repeatedly enlarged the photos.</p>

<p>[United Press, Seattle, 16th] There is enough gunfire in China, so firecrackers can be exported as much as possible. The American cargo ship "American Mail" arrived here today carrying 99 tons of Chinese firecrackers for use in celebrations on American Independence Day on July 4.</p>
<h3>"War on Poverty": British Labour Party's Overseas Policy Goal</h3>
<p>An extremely important section of the policy statement issued by the British Labour Party for the next general election concerns overseas—foreign, Commonwealth and colonial—policy, entitled "Vanguard of World Progress." This section expresses Labour's current views and future plans and hopes in broad principles and certain details.</p>
<p>If the Labour government is re-elected, it will pursue three supreme goals overseas: (1) Peace, enabling the United Nations Organization to achieve the lofty goals for which it was founded; (2) British economic independence, with Britain continuing to lead other countries towards higher living standards and "bolder and freer opportunities for social development"; (3) "An unremitting battle against the age-old scourge of poverty everywhere." These three goals are interrelated.</p>
<p>Under the Labour government, Britain is proving that planning and democracy are not incompatible, and that the parliamentary system can also act quickly to change power relations in society while still preserving freedom of speech and association and protecting dissent.</p>
<p>This section of the declaration lists how the Soviet Union and its satellite states despise cooperation, thus creating a war terror and harming the peaceful wishes of all people. The Soviet Union has refused large-scale exchanges of teachers and students, consistently ignored or undermined the Potsdam Agreement, refused to sign a Four-Power Treaty to prevent Germany's resurgence, rejected American aid to Europe, obstructed, imprisoned, and destroyed socialists who care about the people's livelihood, and has shown that it only respects Western democratic covenants when they are strongly protected and bravely defended.</p>
<p>Britain cannot restore the reduction of national defense spending "when the Soviet regime continues to supply military use with such a large part of the country's resources and pursue its existing policy of non-cooperation." The pursuit of collective security is also a necessity.</p>
<p>In the Labour Party's view, Britain is the common link between the three major national groups, and world peace mainly depends on the vigilance of these countries. The government is trying to strengthen these three interdependent and interconnected groups, and their future cooperation largely depends on Britain, which is the only one that belongs to all three groups. The declaration strongly states that the door to cooperation with the Soviet Union remains open, as long as the Soviet government is willing to cooperate.</p>
<p>The movement for closer cooperation among European countries is the culmination of Britain's policy since the war. Western European countries cannot expect to prosper without progress towards closer unity. The value of the British to the Western European alliance lies in its support from the Commonwealth. Without Britain's help, the foundation for close links between the Western European alliance and the Commonwealth would probably never be laid.</p>
<p>The way Britain is pursuing complete economic independence has enabled it to have new and favorable relations with the United States. Most of the European recovery would have been impossible without American aid. "The British government has made it clear that it will never accept conditions that compromise freedom of choice, and the American government has not put forward such conditions." American trade unions have made a great contribution in upholding this "intelligent and generous view."</p>
<p>The Labour Party's third goal—eradicating poverty, unemployment, and near-famine—has already contributed to the following achievements: the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the European Economic Recovery Program have allocated credit loans and gifts, new forms of assistance have been implemented in the Middle East and the Far East, and Britain has cancelled rice and implemented bread rationing. The Labour Party is deeply proud of these efforts, which have stopped famine, disease, and collapse in vast areas, and will "continue to fulfill its responsibility as a good citizen of the world."</p>
<p>In the past four years, almost none of the forty colonies have failed to advance towards the goal of self-government. The Labour Party's economic policy towards the colonies is to export capital goods that the colonies urgently need to the colonies, thereby increasing the colonies' production. The Labour Party has also established many public enterprises in various colonies, including two new enterprise companies and the East African peanut planting project.</p>
<p>In addition, the Labour Party has also worked hard to improve the working environment in the colonies since the war, and has had huge plans for housing, education, medical prevention and research, and promoting agriculture and industry. In short, Britain and her colonies have joined hands to prepare to jointly eradicate ignorance, poverty, and disease, and solve the problems of colored peoples. (British News Service Draft)</p>

<h3>Consulates of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia in Spain Bombed; Suspected to Be the Work of Anti-Franco Factions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Madrid, 16th] The consulates of Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru in Barcelona were damaged by bombings this morning. The ambassadors of the three countries in Madrid immediately protested to the Spanish Foreign Ministry. No one was injured in the explosions. Police believe that the case was caused by the fact that the three countries actively advocated the full restoration of diplomatic relations with Spain at the United Nations General Assembly. (This proves that the forces opposing the Franco regime in Spain are still strong). The Governor of Barcelona Province has ordered all detectives to go out to hunt down the perpetrators. The embassies, legations, consulates, and residences of diplomatic personnel of countries that supported the restoration of relations with Spain in the United Nations General Assembly have been assigned additional police to guard them. Those suspected of being Communists, especially those who have been temporarily released, will be arrested immediately. It is expected that one million people will be re-imprisoned.</p>

<h3>Principles for Requisitioning Materials Determined; Jointly Handled by Police Headquarters and Municipal Government; Categories to Be Allocated by Respective Trade Associations</h3>

They demanded silence, ransacked the house, and stole eight gold rings, three watches, a radio, twelve silver dollars, and a raincoat. As they fled, Wang Baoqing, a 35-year-old coppersmith from Huzhou living at No. 8 in the same alley, who had recently suffered losses from stolen firewood stored in the alley, saw the robbers carrying weapons and followed them, shouting "Robbers!" This angered the robbers, who turned around and fired a shot at him, hitting him in the head and causing him to collapse. Seeing that they had caused a major incident, the robbers fled towards North Caojiazhai. At that time, two leather merchants, Zhang Dequan and Luo Shangfa, were passing by. The robbers, on the pretext of enforcing the curfew, stopped them and attempted to search them for valuables. Fortunately, Lu Dongbo, a volunteer police squad leader from the French Concession Branch, was on patrol and noticed the robbers questioning them. Suspecting something was amiss, he immediately notified the French Concession Road Police Station. A patrol officer led police to the scene, and Wei Jinquan, a member of the judicial section of the French Concession Police Station, led 50 plainclothes and uniformed police officers in police vehicles to the scene. The robbers, attempting to strike first, opened fire, resisting arrest. Police officers No. 5710 and 3720, as well as volunteer police officers, returned fire. The robbers fled into the darkness. After a search, it was discovered that two robbers had fled to the residence of Dr. Cao Kaibang at No. 72 North Caojiazhai. Police officers and volunteer police officers followed and apprehended the two robbers, He Baokui and Gu Xianfu, seizing a box gun with seven bullets and a Mauser pistol with four bullets. They confessed that their accomplices, Hou Biao, Li Denggao, Tao Changcai, and Mi Laowu, were still at large. A search was conducted, but they were not found. However, bloodstains were discovered nearby, indicating that a robber may have been wounded. The injured coppersmith, Wang Baoqing, was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for emergency treatment but died from his injuries. The two captured robbers will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for legal punishment.</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Remittances Not Quoted Yesterday; Silver Dollars Used for Temporary Industrial Loans Still Valued at 4 Million Each</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Although it has been widely reported that silver dollar quotations would be implemented starting this week, yesterday's events proved that the authorities have no intention of quoting them. In response to a reporter's inquiry, the Central Bank stated that it had not received an order from the garrison authorities, so the original silver dollar policy remained unchanged. The silver dollars used by the bank for temporary industrial loans yesterday were still valued at 4 million each. In addition, overseas remittances were not quoted yesterday.</p>
<h3>Eight Ships Operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Shanghai-Ningbo line was originally served by the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangjing and Jiangning ships, and the Ping An Company's Dahua ship, and the Taichangxiang Company's Jiangsu ship, serving Haimen, Wenzhou, and Ningbo. Since the situation on the Yangtze River changed and the Yangtze River ships were suspended, the Dada Company's Dada ship, the Datong Company's Hongda ship, and the Minsheng Company's Minzu ship have all switched to the Shanghai-Ningbo line. In addition, the Chuanshan Company's Chuanshan ship, due to changes in the situation in Wenzhou, has also joined the Shanghai-Ningbo line. Currently, there are eight ships operating between Shanghai and Ningbo, but the schedule is uncertain.</p>
<h3>Bullish News Spreads Frequently; Gold Market Begins Rising Trend</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market was buoyant due to frequent bullish news. Furthermore, with 3 trillion (currency unit not specified) flowing out for Central Bank industrial loans, money was loose, and all parties sought to absorb it. The rising trend continued, with the on-market price reaching the upper limit of 3.84 billion, with no one selling, and trading was suspended again. The off-market price opened at 3.9 billion and 4.1 billion. Midway through the day, due to monthly salary payments, manufacturers released some physical gold, briefly lowering the price to 3.8 billion and 4.0 billion. Near noon, with no action from the Central Bank, the price rose again to 4.0 billion and 4.2 billion at the close. Afternoon trading was quiet, with little change in prices, hovering between 4.0 billion and 4.2 billion, an increase of 800 million compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the off-market price of US dollars was active due to enthusiastic purchases by all parties. The opening price was 7.3 million and 7.808 million, falling to 7 million and 7.5 million, and rising to 7.5 million and 8 million. The noon close was 7.3 million and 7.800 million. Afternoon prices stabilized, remaining at 7.3 million and 7.8 million at the close, an increase of 1.3 million compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the price of jewelry in silver shops rose as gold prices continued to rise, and sales turned strong. The listed price rose to 380 million and 450 million, an increase of 80 million. Silver jewelry was popular at 4 million and 5 million, also up 500,000. Labor costs doubled, and the loss for old gold exchanged for new gold was 16 million per tael.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, gold and silver exchanges remained within the original range. The "3-3 system" for currency was trading at 50 yuan and 55 yuan, against a price of 47 and 50. The price for one type of currency was 46 and 49.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, paper currency and silver exchanges narrowed by 2 jiao.

<h3>Silver Dollar Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the silver dollar market was quiet. All transactions were suspended as merchants awaited the Central Bank's official rate. However, street-level silver bulls were rampant, and underground trading increased daily, with off-market prices continuing to rise.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the silver coin market remained weak. Due to an oversupply and insufficient demand, it lacked the power to rise. Twenty-cent coins were quoted at 130,000-170,000 [currency units], ten-cent coins at 60,000-80,000, and five-cent coins at 30,000-50,000, with little fluctuation.</p>
<p>Tea Market Stable</p>
<p>Amidst the spreading flames of war, prospective buyers in the tea market hesitated, causing transactions to nearly cease. Initially, sellers, pressured by cash flow, attempted to unload their stock regardless of cost, leading to a price decline. However, recently, the inflationary trend in non-tea commodities has reignited, and tea reserves are dwindling. As a result, even with few buyers, most sellers prefer to hold onto their stock, leading to a firming trend. Prices have become more stable than before, and the outlook no longer appears precarious.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Rises</p>
<p>After a prolonged period of stagnation, the tung oil market suddenly experienced a surge yesterday. At closing, standard-weight white oil rose to 100 million [currency units] per dan (a unit of weight). Both the standard and premium Xihong brands were trading at 100 million [currency units] beyond customs, equating to 120 million [currency units] and 115 million [currency units] per barrel, respectively. This was due to rising gold prices and renewed confidence. Holders raised prices sharply, but buying interest waned, and overall trading remained lackluster.</p>
<h3>Completion of Pipe Laying on Changshou Branch Road</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] During rainy weather, the Changshou Branch Road in western Shanghai would become muddy. The Jiangning District Office initiated a project funded by special assessments, overseen by the Fourth District Works Management Office of the Public Works Bureau. Construction began at the end of February of this year, including the installation of 199 meters of twelve-inch pipes, ten manholes, and twenty drains. The project was recently completed. The paved street surface, measuring 1330 square meters, is currently being actively repaired and is expected to be fully completed by the end of the month.</p>

<h3>Bandit Xiong Bingnan Executed in Jiangwan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The bandit Xiong Bingnan, originally named Jiang Boqi, committed a kidnapping in 1937 and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. At the end of the same year, he was temporarily released on bail due to the tense situation. Around that time, the Haimen County Judicial Office was ordered to transfer seriously convicted criminals to Chongming. They hired a sailing ship from Qinglong Port for the transport. During the voyage, Jiang Boqi and two others, Chen Jixin, were introduced by the escorting officer Huang Zhenfei. On the high seas, they produced handguns, released all the prisoners from their shackles, and then tied up the escorting officers Lu Tingxi, Huang Nengyu, Li Tingsen, Gu Deqing, Chen Yushan, Ji Dianhua, He Fuxiang, and Xu Jianhao, throwing them into the sea to their deaths. They stole public funds and property and fled to Shanghai, using the alias Xiong Bingnan. On March 18th, along with Wu Hanqing and others who were also at large, they robbed the home of Yu Tongxiu Feng on Guangyuan Road. After a clear investigation, they were sentenced to death according to law. On May 16th, at 3:00 PM, the identity of the criminal was verified, he was bound and taken to the Jiangwan execution ground, and executed by firing squad.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of Xikang's Population</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper Xu Renchang</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Ya'an, 6th via airmail] Remote Xikang has always been shrouded in mystery in the minds of people. When it comes to its population, some say it is 5 million, some say 3 million, and some say only 1.5 million. Comparing the highest estimate of 5 million with the lowest estimate of 1.5 million, the difference is a staggering 3.5 million. This large discrepancy is due to the fact that Xikang has never had an accurate population census. Many figures are just casual estimates. Furthermore, some estimates include the entire territory of Xikang, regardless of ethnicity or whether administrative power reaches there, while others only count the Kang and Han ethnicities that can be investigated, excluding the border populations. Neither of these methods is accurate or reliable, and the mystery of Xikang's population remains unsolved.</p>
<p>Now, relevant departments have conducted a preliminary survey and statistics, which can be said to be valuable data for studying borderland and population issues. The entire province includes fifteen ethnicities, totaling 1,917,397 people, with 999,037 males and 918,360 females. The Han ethnicity numbers 1,110,183, with 554,925 males and 555,231 females. They are distributed in the Ning, Ya, and Kang prefectures. The ten counties and bureaus of Ning Prefecture (excluding Puge and Lunin) account for about 50%, the six counties of Ya Prefecture account for about 40%, and the nineteen counties of Kang Prefecture account for about 10%. The Kang ethnicity numbers 185,477, with 93,976 males and 91,501 females, and are distributed in the counties of Kang Prefecture. The Tibetan ethnicity numbers 4,172, with 1,837 males and 1,335 females. The Lolo ethnicity (Black Yi) numbers 180,144, with 104,788 males and 75,556 females (excluding Lunin). The Lolo ethnicity (White Yi) numbers 169,634, with 91,024 males and 78,610 females. These Black and White Yi people are scattered throughout the Ning Prefecture. The Shuitian ethnicity numbers 23,750, with 2,270 males and 12,483 females. The Mosuo ethnicity numbers 74,946, with 46,461 males and 28,485 females, residing in various parts of Ning Prefecture, in the southwest, and in places like Ba'an. The [blank] ethnicity numbers 483, with 242 males and 241 females, residing in Dechang County. The Fan ethnicity numbers 71,457, with 28,074 males and 43,383 females. The Manchu ethnicity numbers 826, with 452 males and 374 females, residing in Baoxing County. The Miao ethnicity numbers 5,925, with [blank],510 males and 1,821 females. The Gami ethnicity numbers 12,363, with 5,214 males and 7,149 females. The Lisu ethnicity numbers 56,792, with 38,931 males and 17,861 females. The Gucong ethnicity numbers 30,000, with 17,646 males and 12,354 females. All the above ethnicities are scattered throughout the counties and bureaus of Ning Prefecture. The Gayong ethnicity numbers 3,136, with 1,625 males and 1,511 females, residing only in a corner of Kangding.</p>
<p>The population distribution in Xikang is quite uneven. Ya Prefecture is relatively prosperous, Ning Prefecture is second, and Kang Prefecture is last. This is the result of the population statistics, and it is also true based on imagination. However, according to the natural environment, Ning Prefecture has a mild climate and abundant produce. It can be considered a naturally blessed place in Kang Province, but its population density is not as high as that of Ya Prefecture. This is due to the border affairs problem. In the past, Han villages were often robbed by bandits. All the people and their belongings had to be moved elsewhere, and they fled in all directions. Even fertile fields were abandoned. Therefore, the population of Ning Prefecture not only did not increase, but decreased day by day. Since the establishment of the province, the authorities have used this data to determine policies - the Three Transformations Policy, and the principle of equal treatment for Han and Yi people, so that Han and Yi people live in peace with each other. This has indeed achieved considerable success. This can't be denied as a success. Kang Prefecture has a vast territory, but the population is the smallest. From a superficial point of view, it seems to be due to the high altitude and cold weather. In reality, the main reason is that Buddhism is prevalent in the Kang region. Lamas are a special class who do not marry. Because the Lamas control political and religious power, the people of Kang are proud of them and send their children to become Lamas. Therefore, the population has not increased for a long time, and may even be decreasing. Other reasons include the complexity of ethnicities, poor marriage systems, and reliance on gods for healing instead of medicine. These are all reasons for the population decline. The provincial authorities are also trying to remedy this situation by respecting religion and changing customs. This has also achieved some success.</p>
<h3>Talking About Anhui Tea During the Tea Season</h3>
<p>— Correspondent for this Newspaper Dong Min</p>
<p>Southern Anhui is a tea-producing area, especially famous for "Tun Green" and "Qi Red" teas, known both domestically and internationally. In earlier years, it exclusively occupied a large portion of foreign exchange earnings, and it remains a significant export specialty area. Over the past decade, frequent warfare has devastated the rural economy, and commerce has gradually declined. The 400,000 tea farmers, tea merchants, and tea workers who rely on tea for a living depend entirely on the tea season for their annual sustenance. However, manufacturers and transporters lack the capital to purchase raw tea, and tea farmers are unable to pick and roughly process the tea. Moreover, even if they did pick the tea, there would be no buyers. Since the Anti-Japanese War, they have relied on government loans for their operations. If loans are not provided in a year, the tea fields are abandoned in that year. In addition, the delays in loan disbursement in the past have meant that funds arrived too late, directly affecting production and quality. At the same time, government loans have primarily targeted tea merchants and have not been directly disbursed to tea farmers, creating an unfavorable situation in which intermediaries exploit and undercut prices. The tea market is of paramount importance to the economy and finance of southern Anhui. The tea season begins around the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar each year and ends before the Mid-Autumn Festival, lasting approximately 200 days, accounting for three-fifths of the year. As the wheat fields ripple and the rapeseed flowers bloom, this year's tea season has arrived. Tea farmers and tea merchants are anticipating tea loans like a severe drought awaiting clouds. Local authorities, responding to requests from various sectors, have telegraphed the relevant national banks, urging them to promptly announce this year's tea loan plan, simplify loan procedures, seize the opportunity, and prevent production from being adversely affected.</p>
<p>Southern Anhui has a vast tea-producing area, with Tunxi and Qimen serving as the key hubs for processing and transportation. The manufacturing and packaging for tea sold domestically and exported to Europe and the United States vary. The estimated total output and production area of export tea this year are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Tun Green Area: Xiuning 40,000 boxes, She County 20,000 boxes, Wuyuan 20,000 boxes, Jixi 4,000 boxes, Huo County 2,000 boxes, Qimen 5,000 boxes, Jingde 2,000 boxes, Taiping 2,000 boxes, Jing County 2,000 boxes, totaling 100,200 boxes, with each box weighing 60 catties, totaling 61,200 dan. (2) Qi Red Area: Qimen 20,000 boxes, Zhide 3,000 boxes, Guichi 2,000 boxes, totaling 25,000 boxes, with each box weighing 50 catties, totaling 12,500 dan. The total export of red and green tea is 73,700 dan.</p>
<p>Production Costs</p>
<p>According to tea industry estimates, the production costs for red and green tea this year are: (1) The estimated cost of green tea at the factory is 150 silver dollars per dan, totaling 9.18 million silver dollars. (2) The estimated cost of red tea at the factory is 200 silver dollars per dan, totaling 2.5 million silver dollars. The total cost of red and green tea is 11.68 million silver dollars. If 70% of the cost is covered by loans, a total of 8.176 million silver dollars is needed. The types and timing of loans are divided into three categories: "primary processing," "secondary processing," and "transport and sales." Loans for primary processing of Tun Green tea should be disbursed before "Grain Rain," and loans for secondary processing should be disbursed before "Beginning of Summer." Loans for transport and sales should be disbursed half a month after secondary processing. Loans for primary processing of Qi Red tea should be disbursed before "Qingming," and loans for secondary processing should be disbursed before "Grain Rain." Loans for transport and sales should be disbursed half a month after secondary processing. Loans for primary and secondary processing account for 40%, while loans for transport and sales account for 60%. According to the tea industry's suggestions, (1) The Central Relief Committee and the Provincial Government should immediately announce the loan plan and date. (2) Simplify procedures. (3) Before the Central Tea Loan is disbursed, the Provincial Bank should be instructed to provide credit loans first. (4) The tea area business in western Anhui has ceased. The Provincial Government is requested to transfer last year's loan funds to this year's southern Anhui tea area to expand lending. (5) The Provincial Bank should jointly form a tea loan group with the national banks providing loans to improve efficiency and jointly disburse the loans. The above are the opinions of the tea industry and represent the interests of tea merchants. Although they have not stated that loans should be given to tea merchants, according to past examples, loan banks believe that tea merchants have organizations, fixed factory locations, and can influence the repayment deadline, and can send personnel to the factory to supervise. On the other hand, tea farmers are scattered in the countryside, numerous, disorganized, and lack sound organizations. Cooperatives are just a signboard. However, the government's original intention of loans was to benefit both tea farmers and tea merchants. Giving all the loans to tea merchants primarily aims to increase their purchasing power. In reality, tea farmers who bring tea to sell often find that they do not earn enough to cover their costs due to the calculation of color and quality. Besides painfully taking losses, there is no other way. Because of this suppression, many tea farmers are angered and abandon their tea gardens. Improving the loan methods seems to be necessary. Otherwise, if things continue as before, tea farmers will not grow tea, tea merchants will have no tea to process, and the national bank may not need to provide tea loans again, but the loss in foreign exchange is always a significant loophole.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Tea Talk</p>
<p>Besides the red and green teas exported abroad, the domestic Qing tea produced in southern Anhui is probably known to everyone, and it can be said that everyone needs it. However, southern Anhui is very large, with high mountains, low mountains, plains, fertile land, and barren land. Naturally, the tea produced varies in quality. The new tea will soon be on the market, and I will talk about it here. The best Qing tea in southern Anhui is produced in Taiping County and Jing County. The tea produced there is listed as Yuqian tea. It is bright green, and the leaves are thick, large, straight, and flat. When viewed in sunlight, it contains hidden hairs. When brewed with boiling water, its fragrant aroma floats with the heat, and the tea liquid is as clear as lake water. The Yuqian tea produced in Ningguo County and Jixi County has small, thin leaves, green in color with a hint of yellow. Each leaf is pointed, and its white hairs are clearly visible. Over time, it loses its green color and turns yellow with black spots. When brewed and drunk, the fragrance is also good, but it feels astringent on the tongue compared to Taiping and Jing County tea. Yuqian tea produced in Qingyang County has leaves that curl like iron wire, with a curved shape like monkey rings, and white hairs floating at the tip. It is dark green in color with hidden green, and it is also very palatable when brewed. It is slightly inferior to Ningguo tea, but the tea is very famous because the monks of "Jiuhua Mountain" often give this tea to pilgrims. Therefore, Qingyang tea sold in other places is said to have the beautiful name of "Jiuhua Maofeng," but it is not a particularly precious tea. The worst is the tea produced in the border areas of Xuancheng. The leaves look quite tender, but when brewed with water, the liquid is thin and tasteless. It not only lacks fragrance but also has a very unpleasant grassy smell. However, the new tea here comes out the earliest. It may grow before Qingming because it is produced on the plains, which are easily warmed by the sun and blended with spring rain, plus fertilizer. Therefore, it sprouts earliest. Tea merchants do not buy this kind of tea. At this time, the tea peddlers' opportunity arrives. They go to the homes of tea farmers in the border plains to buy it and shout in the streets: "Selling new tea, selling new tea..." People often see that the leaves look good and buy them home, but when they brew and drink it, they immediately know that it does not taste good and will not buy it again next time.</p>

<h3>Tongde Xie Sauce Garden Generously Assists Refugee Children</h3>
<p>Respected Sirs: Having read in your esteemed newspaper about the more than two hundred refugee children from the Jiangsu Orphanage who fled from Xuzhou to Shanghai, I learned that their funding has been cut off, and the children lack food and clothing. They are only provided with thin porridge twice a day, without any side dishes for sustenance, leading to malnutrition and a gaunt appearance. Upon learning of this, our colleagues at the garden were deeply saddened. We visited this morning and confirmed the situation. With the intention of caring for the young, we will, starting today, have our garden and its affiliate, Changde Sauce Garden, deliver more than ten catties of pickles daily for them to eat with their meals, and we will also donate eight hundred bolts of flour to make shorts for the refugee children. Our garden's resources are limited, but we hope to express our shared human compassion and consider the nation's future generations by fulfilling our humble duty. We hope your newspaper will publish this letter, which will encourage the numerous charitable individuals in Shanghai. This is also a way to attract more investment to this cause. Respectfully submitted to the Shen Bao Social Services Column, Tongde Xie Sauce Garden, No. 511 Jiangsu Road, Shanghai.</p>
