<h3>統一德國基本問題　四外長意見分歧　蘇重申恢復盟管制要求　艾契遜提出經濟統一兩項條件</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿五日電〕四強外長今日舉行第三次會議，由蘇聯外長維辛斯基任主席，討論德國統一問題，歷時三小時半，未能有趨向協議的任何發展。英美法及蘇聯的外長各自宜布其對德國統一的一般原則，並攻擊彼此的意見。</p>
<p>今日會談的出發點，是西方三國的拒絕雅辛斯基昨日所提出的恢復四強管制，和蘇聯的參加魯爾工業管制。維辛斯基第一次以本屆會議主席地位發言，根據法律點，答覆西方三強之拒絕接受維氏昨日之建議，並重申渠昨日所提要求恢復四強管制的建議。美國務鄉艾契遜指出經濟統一有兩項條件，即（一）停止自東德取得賠償給付物；（二）就德國東部的蘇聯資金獲得協議。法國許曼外長指出除非規定四強必須意見一致的原則，祗能在例外情形之下使用，則四強共管制度始能行得通，同時必須允許德人得在西德與東德的民主制度內，有廣泛的權限。貝文外相亦強調必須允許德人有選擇其政治及經濟制度的自由。會議最後乃於當地時間晚七時十五分結束。與會之美代表團顧問杜勒斯事後表示，在今日之會中並無新建議提出，惟討論經過至為詳盡複雜，非三言兩語所能概括報告。</p>
<p>造成德國分裂　西方推卸責任</p>
<p>〔新華社北平廿六日電〕據塔斯社巴黎訊：二十四日四國外長會議開始討論第一項議程，卽「德國的統一包括經濟原則政治原則和盟國管制」問題，英外相貝文担任主席，蘇外長維辛斯基在討論時，首先發言，維辛斯基首先闡述德國經濟·政治統一問題的重要性，並回溯雅爾達·渡茨坦會議和一九四七年莫斯科外長會議關於這一問題的重要決定。其後，維辛斯基論及德國管制委員會的活動，德國賠償問題和魯爾問題。他重申蘇聯政府在這些問題上的態度，在列舉事實之後，維辛斯基批評了美英法政府在德國所採取的分裂措施。為了保證德國經濟與政治的統一起見，維辛斯基向會議提出下列具體建議：（一）恢復德國管委會的活動，恢復柏林各盟國聯合司令部，（二）以東西佔領區現存的經濟委員會為基礎，建立全德國的國務會議，恢復柏林市議會。維辛斯某發言之後，美·法·英外長相繼發言。美國務卿又契遜說：當他傾聽維辛斯基的演說時，他發生了這種希望，外長會議或者會在德國統一問題上獲致協議。但是艾契遜進一步的發言，卻反對蘇聯所提的建議，並使人清楚地了解，美國代表團繼續堅持以前的立場，不打算消除它在西德所進行的分裂活動。艾契遜力圖證明西德的所謂肅清納粹和剷除軍國主義業已完成，該地的戰犯業已受到審判與懲處，一切民主自由業已在該地完全實現，因此，在管制初期擺在盟國管制面前的任務，據說業已在西佔區解決了。艾契遜辯稱，西方國家對德國的分裂不負任何責任，他說：德國是自動分裂成單獨部分的，有如由單獨的細胞組成的器官一樣。談到蘇聯代表團的建議時，艾契遜說：建議使他「失望」，他反對在以前的基礎上恢復管制委員會活動的建議。他硬說這種步驟將使「正在康復的病人再度陷入完全麻痹狀態」，艾契遜談及蘇聯關於成立全德國務會議的建議時說：如果這樣做，將是後退一步，而不是前進一步。法外長許曼和英外相貝文關於德國統一問題的發言，某些方面同意艾契遜的意見，某些方面則含糊其詞。</p>
<h3>波蘭展開　生產競賽</h3>

<p>上海過去是帝國主義侵略中國的殖民地，是國民黨反動派殘害人民的屠場。今後將是人民自己的民主重鎮。我們要高度發揚上海的人民革命傳統，使新生的上海成為建設新中國的一支鐵軍。</p>
<p>我捫以異常興奮歡愉的心情迎接革命的新勝利，慶賀本市與各地人民的新生。但我們不只是要在形式上慶祝一番就了事，大家要進一步學習解放軍的堅苦卓絕精神，協助革命事業的推進，為建設新上海新中國而長期努力。在目前，全上海的同胞應當一同進行下面幾樁事情：第一，盡一切可能，給正在戰鬥和休息中的解放軍以物質上精神上的協助。第二，慰勞人民解放軍全體將士。第三，救護並慰問傷病的榮譽將土。第四，悼念戰死的解放軍戰士與為革命犧牲的民主烈士，並捐款濟助他們的遺族。第五，協助人民解放軍與市政接收人員及早恢復上海的秩序與繁榮。第六，檢舉潛伏的戰犯與國民黨特務，防止反動份子的陰謀破壞與搗亂。第七，協助新政府機關救護難胞。第八，協助人民解放軍與政治接收人員推行八大公約。</p>

<p>又本市民主建國會同人，昨為表示歡迎人民解放軍熱忱，亦發表宣言，茲摘錄要點如次</p>
<p>今天是上海初獲解放的光榮日子，上海六百萬市民於狂歡慶祝之餘自應勇敢地一致地站立起來，協助人民解放軍接管大上海的工作，並立即動員全市人民的力量，來完成下列各項最重要的工作：第一，必須保護公私各種生產部門完整無損。第二，必須保全公私各種財產物資完好無缺。第三，必須維持公私各種企業機構機關學校等繼續工作。第四，必須保全賬冊文件，協助接管，準備點交。第五，必須安定社會秩序，維持治安。第六，必須繼續恢復生產，增加產量。第七，必須革除舊習慣，學習新生活，愛惜物資，節約消費。第八，必須竭盡可能貢獻人力物力，支援解放軍事，尤須敬愛人民解放軍的戰士與家族，擴大慰勞與救助。第九，必須擁護民主革命的新政權，遵守人民政府的新法令。第十，必須毫不徇情地檢舉國民黨的間諜分子與地下特務，揭發其陰謀，破壞其組織。</p>

<p>上海的工商企業家們，新民主主義的政策是「發展生產，繫榮經濟，公私兼顧，勞資兩利，」它將幫助你們在有利於國民經濟發展的前提下，發展你們的事業，增進全民和你們的自由和幸福。因此，要求你們維持並恢復生產，協助人民解放的事業，並毫不遲疑的振奮起來，支援民主革命在全國的勝利。</p>
<p>上海的店員職工們，青年學生們，知識份子們，公教人員們，軍警同胞們，及其他各階層的市民們！今天這人民偉大的解放事業，更迫切地需要你們繼續光榮的傳統，勇敢地加入革命隊伍，協助接管，貫徹解放，擔負起新中國建設的任務。</p>

<h3>我們有了報仇的人</h3>
<p>— 高樹棠</p>
<p>〔新華社浙贛前綫廿六日電〕乘勝追擊的解放軍，踏進了十幾年前的閩浙贛老解放區，戰士們顯得格外興奮，再向南走三十里，就是樂平縣城了。大家正在唱着，猛聽得路邊一陣悽厲的哭聲，戰士們不由得停下步來，只見路旁一間露了頂的草房裏，一個披着亂髮的小姑娘，正爬在一具棺材上慟哭着，身旁一個小男孩哭得只在地上打滾，兩人一聲聲地叫喚着死去的母親，聽着就像刀子扎在心頭一樣。人民的戰士忍不住走上前去，安慰這兩個孤兒，村邊土坡後忽然有人喊道：</p>
<p>「出來吧！不是蔣介石的軍隊，還唱着紅軍三大紀律歌呢！」</p>
<p>於是，土坡後擁出來一大羣老百姓，男的女的，老的小的，都圍到解放軍跟前來了，這走在最前頭的一個老太婆，像見了親人似地拉着戰士們說道：「同志們再不來呀，人死光了，房子也要燒光了。」她家姓黃，這村叫塔前村，昨天國民黨匪軍第六十八軍正打從這裡逃過去。黃老太太指棺材上那小姑娘說：「國民黨一排長和七八個兵一起，拉上她就往後屋走，她媽洪大嫂拼命扯住那排長的腿求饒，那狗排長回頭一槍，洪大嫂就這樣給打死了，姑娘才十四歲，叫幾個狗賊兵糟蹋呀，你看她叫糟蹋成什麼樣子了！」</p>
<p>小姑娘爬在棺材上已經哭不出聲了，黃老太太看她兩眼腫得血紅，單薄的身子又黃又瘦，忍不住叫了聲「我這沒人照管的孩子呀！」就一頭伏到棺材上，也放聲大哭起來。地上那小男孩，忽地爬了起來，兩隻小手只管掀着棺材，小腦袋就拼命往裏擠，哭喊得滿頭滿臉通紅。這時黃老太太擦抹着眼淚，過來拉着這兩個孤兒說「小女小兒，紅軍給咱報仇來啦！聽嬸嬸的話，不哭不哭」小孩卻哭得更加傷心起來，更加用力掀着棺材蓋，一聲聲哭喊着媽媽。戰士們眼中滿盈着淚水，不知道怎樣去安慰她們，只是憤怒地捏着武器。訴苦的人越來越多了，一個被匪軍從都昌抓住桃子彈的十二三歲的小孩說，他親眼看見一個匪軍連長，在離這裏四里路的林田村，強姦一個婦女，她不依從，那狗連長就用刺刀挖掉了她的左眼珠，頓時血像噴泉般地從眼裏湧出來，她痛得咬着頭髮滿地打滾，一下子滾到水渠裘，馬上把水渠也染紅了，一頓飯功夫，她便死在渠裏了。一個湖北黃梅縣的青年何力先，大哭着控訴匪軍從他家鄉撇退的時候，把他的妻子強姦死了，他把地賣光了，才把媳婦埋掉，但他又被願徒們抓夫來到這裏。一個湖口人叫翟祖的，兩父子被匪軍抓了挑子彈，走到南邊那村子時，他父親實在挑不動了，匪軍便把他的父親和另外三個老人，一起挑進一間房子裏，放火活活的燒死了。另一個哭訴着和他一起挖野菜的馬家兄弟，回家時路過村南的大木橋，正碰上匪軍的敗兵，匪徒們不問青紅皂白，一刺刀就把他挑下橋去摔死了，現在橋上還有血跡。訴不完的血海深仇，使每一個在場的人都滿眼淚水。「不要難過啦！」戰士們簡短地說：「我們給你們報仇！」</p>
<p>四路縱隊的解放大軍，又從北面開過來了，村民洪明幹說：「大家別難過，我們有了報仇的人！快給同志們弄水吧，我去給同志們弄糧食！」塔前村頓時忙碌起來了，人們燒水，做飯，到處是一片報仇聲。「給咱們報仇的隊伍來啦，快呀！」人們在村裏喊着，「報仇呀，同志們，把那些狗養的國民黨賊軍都抓起來！」人們在路邊喊着，爬在棺材上的小姑娘，現在也提着開水來到路邊，對解放軍指着棺材說：「這是我的娘，同志給我報仇呀！」部隊繼續前進着，每個人的步伐更加緊了，在黃塵滾滾的公路上，響起了憤怒的歌聲：「蔣介石你往那裏逃！」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日午後記者在南碼頭渡口，遇一甫自浦東白龍港附近步行經小灣、張江柵、北蔡等地來滬之鄉民，據云：自解放迄今，鄉間極為安寗，沿途步行便利。在本月中解放軍自南匯沿欽公塘向北進展至小營房時，與國民黨軍稍有接觸，國民黨軍全部沿上川鐵路退至慶寗寺。自白龍港至川沙、龔家路、新港、合慶一帶十餘里週圍內，未遭受重大損失，房屋損毀極微，鄉民死亡者更少。僅川沙城內曾落有炸彈一二枚而已。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕楊家渡已有渡輪，可通浦西，（但不是市輪渡）鎮上市面至為繁榮，董家渡、東昌路一帶秩序均佳，民房亦無破壞，只有在砲位邊房屋，大都被國民黨軍拆去。洋涇、東市梢一帶，戰事比較劇烈，房屋破壞甚多。洋涇鎮後面的七號橋，亦被國民黨軍炸壞。</p>
<h3>夜間槍聲　是信號槍　可毋驚慌</h3>

<h3>市區公共交通　陸續恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨天市區公共交通已經陸續恢復，法商二路，四路，十路有軌電車與廿一，廿二路公共汽車在早晨七時後即出廠行駛，惟開出車輛極少。如有軌電車大約每隔數十分鐘才有一輛，以致每一輛車中都是擁擠不堪。英商二路有軌電車亦已恢復行駛，但因三板廠橋以東蘇州河北岸尚有敵軍負嵎頑抗，南岸自卡德路至外灘間時有流彈，所以僅自靜安寺駛至卡德路站為止。無軌電車二十路及二十四路亦有幾輛行駛。市辦各路公共汽車昨天尚未恢復，但下午有三十多輛空車自東向西駛至楓林橋，今天亦可能恢復行駛。</p>

<h3>滬虞蘇錫交通　今有汽車試行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市區對外之水陸交通雖尚多未及恢復，在此過渡時期內，有中華運輸車行，計劃利用錫滬公路，溝通上海與常熟蘇州無錫間之交通。其行駛路線為自市區出發，經南翔馬陸至嘉定，經外岡葛隆鎮至太倉，再經雙鳳直墉支墉白茆古里村而抵常熟。至常熟後再分成兩路，分別至蘇錫。沿途約需六小時，據云並無危險，但收費甚昂，計常熟銀圓七元，蘇州八元，無錫十元。今日開出第一班，尚為試探性質，因沿公路之橋樑不能載重，故所用之車輛均為出差汽車，每車載客六人。</p>

<p>馬路銀元，交易益趨旺盛，價格稍見下降，因現鈔籌碼缺乏，各方出多進少，市呈一片賣出聲。大頭喊三八〇〇萬，四〇〇〇萬，小頭喊三六〇〇萬，三八〇〇萬，鷹龍洋喊三三〇〇萬，三六〇〇萬，較上日下跌二百萬。</p>

<h3>United States and a Dozen Countries Consult on Common Policy, Discuss Recognizing China's New Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Acting Secretary of State Webb confirmed today that the United States has been consulting with "about a dozen" other countries on the issue of formulating a common policy toward the CCP, but he also stated: "I do not intend to call this consultation a necessary trend toward recognition (recognizing the CCP government). We are all watching this situation carefully and are trying to find the best way to deal with it according to the development of the situation." He revealed that the countries that have consulted with the United States on this issue include the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, India, Pakistan, New Zealand, Ceylon, and South Africa.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 26th] Hong Kong's New Life Evening News said that business and education figures here expect that Britain will soon recognize the Chinese Communist government, noting that this move is "realistic and wise."</p>
<h3>Russell Speech: Supporting the Kuomintang is a Bad Strategy</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 25th] State Department Public Affairs Director Russell said at the "World Trade Week" banquet today that it would be extremely foolish for the United States to support the Chinese Kuomintang government, implying that it should quickly establish relations with the communist regime. Russell said: The Chinese people do not like foreigners, but in any case, they need a large amount of food and industrial cooperation such as machinery. The Kuomintang has collapsed. If you want to support it, you must use American military force and greater financial and economic assistance. This is tantamount to forcing a government that the Chinese people do not trust at all to obey, which will only arouse the resentment of the Chinese people. In the Chinese Civil War, the Kuomintang army had superior firepower in every major battle, and it also had an air force, but they all surrendered without fighting. The only reason is that the Kuomintang government has lost the trust of the Chinese people.</p>

<h3>Fundamental Problems of German Unification: Disagreement Among the Four Foreign Ministers; Soviet Union Reaffirms Demand for Restoration of Allied Control; Acheson Proposes Two Conditions for Economic Unification</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 25th] The four foreign ministers held their third meeting today, chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, to discuss the issue of German unification. The meeting lasted three and a half hours and failed to show any progress toward an agreement. The foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union each declared their general principles on German unification and attacked each other's views.</p>
<p>The starting point of today's meeting was the Western three powers' rejection of Vyshinsky's proposal yesterday to restore four-power control and Soviet participation in the Ruhr industrial control. Vyshinsky, speaking for the first time as chairman of the current meeting, responded to the Western three powers' rejection of his proposal yesterday, based on legal points, and reiterated his proposal to restore four-power control. US Secretary of State Acheson pointed out that there are two conditions for economic unification: (1) cessation of reparations payments from East Germany; and (2) agreement on Soviet funds in East Germany. French Foreign Minister Schuman pointed out that the four-power control system can only work if the principle that the four powers must agree unanimously is stipulated, and can only be used in exceptional circumstances. At the same time, Germans must be allowed to have extensive powers within the democratic systems of West and East Germany. Foreign Secretary Bevin also emphasized that Germans must be allowed the freedom to choose their political and economic systems. The meeting finally ended at 7:15 pm local time. Dulles, an advisor to the US delegation who attended the meeting, said afterwards that no new proposals were put forward at today's meeting, but the discussion was extremely detailed and complex, and could not be summarized in a few words.</p>
<p>Western Powers Shirk Responsibility for Causing German Division</p>
<p>[Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 26th Dispatch] According to TASS, Paris: The four foreign ministers' meeting on the 24th began to discuss the first item on the agenda, namely "the unification of Germany, including economic principles, political principles, and Allied control." British Foreign Secretary Bevin served as chairman. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky spoke first during the discussion. Vyshinsky first elaborated on the importance of the economic and political unification of Germany and reviewed the important decisions on this issue made at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences and the 1947 Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. Subsequently, Vyshinsky discussed the activities of the German Control Commission, the German reparations issue, and the Ruhr issue. He reiterated the Soviet government's position on these issues. After listing the facts, Vyshinsky criticized the divisive measures taken by the US, British, and French governments in Germany. In order to ensure the economic and political unification of Germany, Vyshinsky put forward the following specific suggestions to the meeting: (1) Restore the activities of the German Control Commission and restore the Allied Joint Command in Berlin; (2) Establish an all-German Council of State on the basis of the existing economic commissions in the eastern and western occupied zones and restore the Berlin City Council. After Vyshinsky spoke, the foreign ministers of the United States, France, and Britain spoke in succession. US Secretary of State Acheson said that when he listened to Vyshinsky's speech, he had the hope that the foreign ministers' meeting might reach an agreement on the issue of German unification. However, Acheson's further remarks opposed the Soviet proposals and made it clear that the US delegation continued to adhere to its previous position and did not intend to eliminate the divisive activities it was carrying out in West Germany. Acheson tried to prove that the so-called denazification and elimination of militarism had been completed in West Germany, that war criminals there had been tried and punished, and that all democratic freedoms had been fully realized there. Therefore, the tasks facing Allied control in the early stages were said to have been resolved in the western occupied zone. Acheson argued that the Western countries were not responsible for the division of Germany. He said that Germany was automatically divided into separate parts, like an organ composed of separate cells. Referring to the Soviet delegation's proposals, Acheson said that the proposals "disappointed" him and that he opposed the proposal to restore the activities of the Control Commission on the former basis. He insisted that this step would cause the "recovering patient to fall back into complete paralysis." Acheson said of the Soviet proposal to establish an all-German Council of State that doing so would be a step backward, not a step forward. French Foreign Minister Schuman and British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speeches on the issue of German unification agreed with Acheson's views in some respects and were ambiguous in others.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy Issue a Letter to All Citizens of Shanghai for the Liberation of Shanghai</h3>
<p>To all citizens of Shanghai: The liberation days we have been longing for have arrived. The People's Liberation Army has swept away the reactionary army like a destructive force and entered Shanghai amidst the warm welcome of the citizens. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army is liberating many major cities in the south and northwest with irresistible force, and the time when the remaining reactionary regimes will be wiped out is not far away. A comprehensive revolutionary victory is about to come. We should not only celebrate the liberation of Shanghai, but also rejoice in the victory of the people everywhere. The glorious victory of the People's Liberation Army proves the greatness of the people's power and also proves that the great tide of the New Democratic Revolution cannot be resisted. This liberation war is an unprecedented people's revolution. It will thoroughly eliminate the four major families of warlords, bureaucrats, party thugs who have harmed the country and the people and committed all kinds of evil, and let the people use their own power to build an independent, free, and happy New China.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai was a colony where imperialists invaded China and a slaughterhouse where the Kuomintang reactionaries persecuted the people. In the future, it will be the people's own democratic stronghold. We must highly promote the people's revolutionary tradition of Shanghai and make the newborn Shanghai an iron army for building a new China.</p>
<p>We greet the new victory of the revolution and celebrate the rebirth of the people in this city and everywhere with unusual excitement and joy. However, we should not just celebrate in form and then be done with it. Everyone should further learn from the People's Liberation Army's spirit of perseverance and hard work, assist in the advancement of the revolutionary cause, and make long-term efforts to build a new Shanghai and a new China. At present, all citizens of Shanghai should carry out the following tasks together: First, do everything possible to provide the People's Liberation Army, which is fighting and resting, with material and spiritual assistance. Second, comfort all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Third, rescue and comfort the wounded and sick soldiers. Fourth, mourn the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who died in battle and the democratic martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution, and donate money to help their families. Fifth, assist the People's Liberation Army and municipal receiving personnel to restore order and prosperity in Shanghai as soon as possible. Sixth, report latent war criminals and Kuomintang secret agents, and prevent the conspiracies, sabotage, and disturbances of reactionaries. Seventh, assist the new government agencies in rescuing refugees. Eighth, assist the People's Liberation Army and political receiving personnel in implementing the Eight Main Rules of Discipline.</p>
<p>Let us unite: Pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army that liberated Shanghai and China! Pay tribute to the Communist Party of China and its leaders who led the New Democratic Revolution! Mourn the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who died in battle and the democratic martyrs who were martyred in various places! Eliminate the remnants of reactionaries all over the country! Strive for the comprehensive victory of the Liberation War! (Shanghai Members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy)</p>
<p>In addition, the members of the Shanghai Democratic National Construction Association also issued a declaration yesterday to express their enthusiasm for welcoming the People's Liberation Army. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the glorious day when Shanghai was first liberated. In addition to celebrating wildly, the six million citizens of Shanghai should bravely and unitedly stand up to assist the People's Liberation Army in taking over the work of Greater Shanghai, and immediately mobilize the power of the city's people to complete the following most important tasks: First, we must protect the integrity of all public and private production sectors. Second, we must preserve the integrity of all public and private properties and materials. Third, we must maintain the continued operation of all public and private enterprises, institutions, schools, etc. Fourth, we must preserve accounting books and documents, assist in the takeover, and prepare for handover. Fifth, we must stabilize social order and maintain public security. Sixth, we must continue to restore production and increase output. Seventh, we must eliminate old habits, learn new lives, cherish materials, and save consumption. Eighth, we must do our best to contribute manpower and materials to support the People's Liberation Army's military affairs, and especially respect and love the soldiers and families of the People's Liberation Army, and expand condolences and assistance. Ninth, we must support the new regime of the democratic revolution and abide by the new laws of the People's Government. Tenth, we must impartially report Kuomintang spies and underground secret agents, expose their conspiracies, and destroy their organizations.</p>
<p>In order to effectively implement the above ten important tasks and accelerate the thorough victory of the democratic revolution, we especially call on people from all walks of life in Shanghai to actively unite and act together.</p>
<p>First of all, the labor compatriots of Shanghai! You are the main force of the New Democratic Revolution, and you are the backbone of the new China after liberation. You should stand on the front line without hesitation and lead the people of all classes forward.</p>
<p>Secondly, fellow farmers, today, in the face of the liberation of Shanghai, the revolutionary people ask you to form a strong worker-peasant alliance with the urban working masses, become a model of liberation in Jiangnan, and lay a solid foundation for the new China of New Democracy.</p>
<p>Shanghai's industrial and commercial entrepreneurs, the policy of New Democracy is "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." It will help you develop your business and increase the freedom and happiness of the whole people and you under the premise of being conducive to the development of the national economy. Therefore, you are required to maintain and restore production, assist the People's Liberation Army's cause, and be revitalized without hesitation to support the victory of the democratic revolution across the country.</p>
<p>Shanghai's shop clerks, employees, young students, intellectuals, public teachers, soldiers, police, and citizens of other strata! Today, this great cause of the people's liberation urgently needs you to continue your glorious tradition, bravely join the revolutionary ranks, assist in the takeover, implement liberation, and take on the task of building a new China.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to solemnly inform people from all friendly countries that you must change the superiority of the imperialists and abandon the attitude of bullying the weak.</p>
<p>Compatriots all over China! Elders, uncles, brothers and sisters of Shanghai! We hereby call on you to stand with us, gather together under the banner of the People's Revolution, abide by the leadership of the People's Liberation regime, assist in the takeover of Shanghai, support the military of the pursuing troops advancing into South China, and enable the Chinese democratic revolution to be completed quickly and peaceful construction to be realized as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>We Have People to Avenge Us</h3>
<p>—Gao Shutang</p>
<p>[Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front, 26th Dispatch] The victorious People's Liberation Army stepped into the old liberated areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi more than ten years ago, and the soldiers appeared particularly excited. Thirty miles further south is the county town of Leping. Everyone was singing when they suddenly heard a miserable cry from the roadside. The soldiers couldn't help but stop. They saw a little girl with disheveled hair crying on a coffin in a dilapidated thatched house by the roadside. A little boy next to her was crying and rolling on the ground. The two were calling out to their dead mother, and it sounded like knives were piercing their hearts. The people's soldiers couldn't help but step forward to comfort the two orphans. Suddenly, someone shouted from behind an earthen slope at the edge of the village:</p>
<p>"Come out! It's not Chiang Kai-shek's army. They're still singing the Three Main Rules of Discipline of the Red Army!"</p>
<p>So, a large group of people, men, women, old and young, emerged from behind the earthen slope and surrounded the People's Liberation Army. An old woman leading the way grabbed the soldiers as if she had seen relatives and said, "If you comrades don't come, everyone will die, and the houses will be burned down." Her surname is Huang, and the village is called Taqian Village. Yesterday, the Kuomintang bandit army's 68th Army had just fled past here. Grandma Huang pointed to the little girl on the coffin and said, "A Kuomintang platoon leader and seven or eight soldiers dragged her to the back room. Her mother, Sister Hong, desperately grabbed the platoon leader's leg and begged for mercy. The dog platoon leader turned around and shot her. Sister Hong was killed like that. The girl is only fourteen years old. She was defiled by those dog thief soldiers. Look how defiled she is!"</p>
<p>The little girl on the coffin had already cried herself speechless. Grandma Huang saw that her eyes were swollen and bloodshot, and her thin body was yellow and thin. She couldn't help but cry out, "My child with no one to take care of her!" and she collapsed onto the coffin and burst into tears. The little boy on the ground suddenly got up, using his two small hands to lift the coffin, and his little head pushed desperately inside, crying with a red face. At this time, Grandma Huang wiped away her tears and came over to pull the two orphans and said, "Little girl, little boy, the Red Army is here to avenge us! Listen to your aunt, don't cry, don't cry." The child cried even more sadly and lifted the coffin lid more vigorously, crying out "Mama" over and over again. The soldiers' eyes were filled with tears, and they didn't know how to comfort them, but they clenched their weapons in anger. More and more people were complaining. A twelve or thirteen-year-old child who was shot with a peach pit by the bandit army in Duchang said that he personally saw a bandit army company commander rape a woman in Lintian Village, four miles away. She refused to obey, so the dog company commander used a bayonet to dig out her left eyeball. Immediately, blood gushed out of her eye like a fountain. She was in so much pain that she bit her hair and rolled all over the ground. She rolled into the water channel, and immediately dyed the water channel red. She died in the channel after a meal's time. He Lixian, a young man from Huangmei County, Hubei, cried and accused the bandit army of raping his wife to death when they withdrew from his hometown. He sold all his land to bury his wife, but he was captured here by the conscription officers. A man from Hukou named Zhai Zu and his father were captured by the bandit army to carry ammunition. When they walked to the village to the south, his father was really unable to carry it. The bandit army tied his father and three other old men into a house and burned them alive. Another person cried that the Ma brothers, who were digging wild vegetables with him, were passing the large wooden bridge south of the village on their way home when they ran into the defeated bandit army. The bandits stabbed him off the bridge with a bayonet without asking any questions, and he was killed. There are still bloodstains on the bridge. The endless sea of ​​blood and deep hatred filled everyone present with tears. "Don't be sad!" the soldiers said briefly, "We will avenge you!"</p>
<p>The People's Liberation Army of the Fourth Column came from the north again. Villager Hong Minggan said: "Don't be sad, we have people to avenge us! Hurry up and get water for the comrades. I'll get food for the comrades!" Taqian Village suddenly became busy, with people boiling water, cooking, and revenge cries everywhere. "The team to avenge us is here, hurry up!" people shouted in the village, "Avenge us, comrades, arrest all those Kuomintang bandit army dogs!" People shouted on the roadside. The little girl on the coffin also came to the roadside with boiled water and pointed to the coffin to the People's Liberation Army and said, "This is my mother, comrades, avenge me!" The troops continued to advance, and everyone's pace became tighter. On the dusty road, angry songs rang out: "Chiang Kai-shek, where are you fleeing!"</p>
<p>Suburban residents who had taken refuge in city hotels rushed to rent cars to return home. (Our Newspaper Photo)</p>

<h3>All Towns in Pudong are Peaceful; Yangjing Suffered More Damage; People From Songjiang Said That the City Has Returned to Normal Long Ago</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the reporter met a villager at the Nanmatou ferry crossing who had just walked from near Bailonggang in Pudong, passing through Xiaowan, Zhangjiangzha, Beicai and other places to Shanghai. According to him, the countryside has been extremely peaceful since liberation, and walking along the way is convenient. When the People's Liberation Army advanced north along the Qin Gongtang from Nanhui to Xiaoyingfang in the middle of this month, there was a slight contact with the Kuomintang army, and the entire Kuomintang army retreated along the Shangchuan Railway to Qingning Temple. Within a range of more than ten miles around Bailonggang, Chuansha, Gongjialu, X港, and Heqing, no major losses were suffered, the damage to houses was minimal, and even fewer villagers died. Only one or two bombs fell in Chuansha city.</p>
<p>[Also reported] There are ferries at Yangjiadu that can take you to Puxi (but not the municipal ferry). The market in the town is very prosperous, and the order in Dongjiadu and Dongchang Road is good. There is no damage to civilian houses, but the houses near the artillery positions have mostly been demolished by the Kuomintang army. The battle was more intense around Yangjing and Dongshi, and many houses were damaged. The No. 7 bridge behind Yangjing town was also blown up by the Kuomintang army.</p>
<h3>Nighttime Gunfire: Signal Shots, No Need to Panic</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the liberation of this city, sporadic gunfire has often been heard at night. These are signal shots fired by the People's Liberation Army during nighttime patrols and searches. There are no bullets involved, so citizens need not panic.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, some villagers from Songjiang also came to Shanghai via the highway, passing through Zhuanqiao, Maqiao, Caohejing, and other places on bicycles. They reported that normal conditions in Songjiang city had been restored for several days. Residents were very calm during the war, and losses were minimal. The towns and villages along the way have also been extremely peaceful since liberation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, someone from Zhoupu reported that when the People's Liberation Army advanced to Zhoupu town, they did not encounter strong resistance. Therefore, the damage to the town and surrounding areas was not significant. However, the Pu Jian Company was set on fire and partially destroyed. Most shops have resumed business, and there were no obstacles encountered on the way to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Meteorological Observatory Undamaged, Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's meteorological observatory sustained no damage during the war. It resumed technical work yesterday.

<h3>Urban Public Transportation Gradually Resuming</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Urban public transportation gradually resumed yesterday. Tram lines 2, 4, and 10, operated by French businesses, and bus lines 21 and 22, began operating after 7:00 AM. However, the number of vehicles running was very limited. For example, trams ran approximately every several tens of minutes, resulting in extremely crowded conditions on each vehicle. Tram line 2, operated by a British business, also resumed operation, but because enemy forces were still putting up stubborn resistance on the northern bank of the Suzhou Creek east of the Sanbanqiao Bridge, and stray bullets were occasionally flying between the southern bank from Carter Road to the Bund, it only ran from Jing'an Temple to the Carter Road stop. A few trolleybuses on lines 20 and 24 were also running. City-operated bus lines did not resume yesterday, but more than thirty empty buses traveled from east to west to Fenglin Bridge in the afternoon. It is possible that they will resume operations today.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Changshu-Suzhou-Wuxi Transportation: Bus Trial Runs Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Although land and water transportation between the city and outlying areas have not yet fully recovered, during this transitional period, the Zhonghua Transportation Company plans to utilize the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway to connect Shanghai with Changshu, Suzhou, and Wuxi. The route will depart from the city, pass through Nanxiang and Malu to Jiading, then through Waigang Gelongzhen to Taicang, and then through Shuangfeng Zhiyong Zhiyong Baimao Gulicun to Changshu. After reaching Changshu, the route will divide into two, going to Suzhou and Wuxi respectively. The entire journey will take approximately six hours, and it is said to be safe, but the fare is quite expensive, at seven silver dollars to Changshu, eight to Suzhou, and ten to Wuxi. The first trip will depart today as a trial run. Because the bridges along the highway cannot bear heavy loads, the vehicles used will be business cars, each carrying six passengers.</p>
<p>Additionally, a passenger transport company is being organized within the Huashang Hotel on North Hai Road. Starting today, they will first restore bus transportation on the Minhang-Pinghu line. Yesterday afternoon, many people registered to purchase tickets. Fares are three silver dollars to Minhang and five silver dollars to Pinghu.</p>

<p>At the intersection of Béthune Road and Wenlin Road in western Shanghai, when the reporter passed by around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, it was seen that vehicles were prohibited from passing. The Bund south of Avenue Edward VII was open and unobstructed, but north of it, there were no people or vehicles.

<h3>Yangko Songs Sung Everywhere on the Streets, Enthusiastically Welcoming the People's Liberation Army</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the reporter toured the western part of Shanghai and saw a long column of People's Liberation Army soldiers marching from west to east on Jing'an Temple Road. At that moment, a Yangko team arrived in front of the Guanshengyuan [confectionery] on Jing'an Temple Road. Two people raised the flags, on which was written "Welcome the People's Liberation Army." The People's Liberation Army soldiers walked under the flags, and the Yangko team sang songs, danced the Yangko dance, and shouted slogans, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Going further west, near Zhao Feng Park, there was a large group of captured Kuomintang soldiers, wearing the "Ping" character symbol, escorted by several People's Liberation Army soldiers, marching from west to east. The prisoners looked very dejected. On the way back, passing through Yuyuan Road, I saw a large team of male and female students dancing the Yangko, wearing red stars and red flowers, and beating gongs and drums. Many passers-by were watching. Near the Paramount Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, two large "People's Propaganda Team" trucks were parked. A large Yangko team was dancing, led by two red flags, with neat steps. This is the new people's song and dance. At the corner of Carter Road, a large group of People's Liberation Army soldiers were sitting in the corner resting. Heavy rain was pouring down, but they would rather endure the rain than enter the people's homes to rest. Their iron discipline won the praise of the citizens. When they reached the Dahua Theater, the rain was even heavier, and the students in the Yangko team were all drenched in the rain.</p>
