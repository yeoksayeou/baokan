<h3>和談繼續在平進行　渡江問題仍為商討中心　黃紹竑昨未返京于右任展期北上</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕和談在北平繼續進行中，黃紹竑十五日仍未返京，渠於十五日下午曾電告此間，謂十四·十五·兩日繼續開會，若干問題尚未獲得協議，渠並表示盼于右任候渠返京交換意見後再行飛平，然黃氏是否可於十六日返京，迄十五日晚尚未悉。據聞：黃氏稽遲不返之原因，可能係政府最近携往之意見於提出後即遭遇若干困難，致使業憶開始之和談不能不因而有所阻礙，無法獲致具體之結論，以便携返參考。按黃氏之行止，原已決定十五日返京，張治中十五日晨與此間通電話時，曾說明黃氏於午後來京，但至午後復未能見諸事實，故京中人士對此不無若干憂慮之處。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕于右任及其隨員一行，在其行　業已準備妥定之際，突於十五日晨臨行前接獲張治中電話囑，務祈於黃紹竑抵京見面晤談後再行啓程，因而延緩行期。于氏十五日晨·晚在其官邸兩度與其隨員集會，詩論若干細節，于氏於十五日深夜接見記者時，對其行期尚不能確切說明，惟十七日為其七十一歲生辰，十六日不能成行，可能展至十七日以後。又隨于飛增者，頃又決定增加監委王新令一人。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕消息確實人士，十五日透露有關和談之進展及癥結問題稱：引為基礎之八項條件，已非和談問題之阻礙，反之，蔣總統之出處及共軍渡江問題，乃當前最困難而亟待商決之先決條件。據稱：中共方面認為，蔣總統雖已引退，但期潛在之力量仍很強大，故目前國軍之部署一當局之配合，顯仍有蔣總統參加指揮之嫌，際此和談進行之中，為減免和談之阻礙，對蔣總統之出處，應予研究，以對渡江問題，中共認為如欲保障和談，共軍必須渡江，其意義一為軍事，一為與後方秩序在關，尤其指出「後方特務橫行」一點之條件，曾研究渡江之方式，擬捨武力進攻，而取和平渡江，政府方面對以上兩項困難，頗感棘手，因蔣總統出處早在其宣布引退之時公告，並已退隱其溪口故里，一再表示不過問政治，今日軍政各事自非彼躬親處理指揮，理至明顯。對於渡江一事，政府亦久已認為渡江足以影響和談，如一旦共軍渡江，則解決各項問題時，顯易遭受威脅，政府代表團已根據此種態度，與中共代表商談以來，迄未獲得結論或任何讓步。若干消極人士，對此甚表憂慮，至八項條件經政府代表與中共代表澈底商談後，已放寬甚大之尺度，戰犯問題，共方不再堅持，但在將來和平條款訂立時，必須載明「追究戰爭責任」之字句，對於法統等，則業已確認中華民國為未來合法之名稱。據權威人士稱：中共對八項條件在原則上係不允變更，即條件必須存在，但內容則可有最大限度之伸縮性，以減少困難。據聞：和談會前交換意見階段，以張治中於八日首次與毛澤東四小時之長談為最重要，截至目前為止，中央之態度，仍係八日商談決定之範圍。</p>
<h3>南北通航意見不一　立院定今再討論　經部再擬定南北物資交換方案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立委李雲良所提南北通航案，十五日下午立院院會已提付討論，首由李委員說明提案要旨，謂通航之提出，有救濟民生，維護航權，節省外匯，便利通郵和適應機宜五項理由，而最重要者，本案為解決當前財政經濟危機之一種急要措施，目前北方在多餘之煤·鹽·大豆·花生·食油·肥料·棉花·燒碱·水泥和其他工業原料可以接濟南方，而南方有過剩之茶葉·糖·捲菸·火柴和工業製成品亦需北方之市場，必賴通航以為之溝通。一月以來「大上海」，「唐山」等十艘輪船由秦皇島運煤至滬，並未發生流弊，惟因上海到天津和其他港口的航綫尚未通航一，致甚多外輪喧賓奪主侵犯我之航權，李氏並對於一般人認為「在和平未實現前不宜通航」之說加以辨正，渠並相信中共亦有通航之誠意。李報告畢，陳顧遠·孫桂藉·鄒樹文等發言，均力言通航之必要，支持李之提案，惟亦有人提出書面意見反對，十五日下午時散會時尚無結果，定於十六日再提付討論表決。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕南北物資交換方案，經濟部已再度擬定，決先從少數物資試辦，以麵易煤，以紗易棉，以捲菸易菸葉。俟試辦有良好結果後，再擴大交換範圍。易貨時除商人自辦外，中信局亦可參加辦理。易貨之口岸仍以天津為限，船舶由交部審核，此項辦法將提出政務會議討論後決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕全國商會聯合會及中華國產商聯合會理事長王曉籟，前為南北物資交流曾聯電中央當局，有所主張，昨接北平中央代表郭今吾覆電云，「全國商聯會廠聯會理事長曉籟，船聯會杜理事長月笙，工業總會劉理事長鴻生暨魏文翰先生勛鑒：卯　電敬悉，保護民族工商業，乃解放區之既定政策，津滬往來物資，如能證明確係國產，當局核准免征進出口稅，以利交流，特此佈覆，弟郭今吾叩卯寒」。</p>
<h3>三立委赴平事純係私人前往　童冠賢在立院宣布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立委李曜林等一零二八人致函童院長事，童院長十五日在立院第十四次會中提出答覆，關於立委發言態度問題，童氏稱：我們來京開會，旨在謀求團結，爭取和平，希望各委員本同舟共濟精神，精誠團結。至各委員發言，每人均有自由，無法制止，至於報載立院遴選三人參加和談之說，並非事實，此次于院長之赴平，係以私人資格前往，隨行之立委，亦係由于先生私人邀約，本人並未參加任何意見，三立委亦係以私人資格前往，並非代表立法院。</p>
<h3>立委百餘人致函童院長　請有效維持會場秩序</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立委李曜林·楊公達·吳延環·宋宜山·邵鏡人·劉振東等一百餘人，為本月十二日院會討論許開天·金紹先兩委員被捕事件時，某委員發言，曾被某一二委員厲聲制止，同時會場引起一片噓聲及報載立院遴選同人三人參加和談事，特於十四日致函童院長，有所建議與詢問，該函於十五日面呈童院長，其原文如下：「冠賢院長勛鑒，當國家風雨飄搖，危險萬狀之今日，本院同人為國家，為民族，對於應負之職責，不致有所逃避，觀之本會期報到人數之踴躍，情緒之緊張，以及重要議案之成立，均可為同人切盡職責之明證，允宜和諧雍穆，以竟全功，不料本月十二日十三次院會討論許·金兩委員被捕事件時，諸同人對於咨請當局處分負責人員一點，原則上毫無異議，所不同者，只是文字及語氣上稍有出入，乃有一二委員不許他人發言，態度之傲慢，氣勢之淩人，已覺不可　邇，且更有以惡言相加，迹近侮辱者，以堂堂之人民代表，於神聖之議壇上，竟如此失態，同人等極表惋惜，本擬當時即有所糾正，誠恐於彼此情感激動之時，如因此而招致情誼上之不快，將更為本院之損失，為此函請先生特予注意，倘再有此類情事發生，務須予以有效之制止，否則會場秩序勢將無法維持，而議會之尊嚴亦將掃地無餘矣。又聞十三日本京益世報載，本院遴選同人三人參加和談，即將北上等語，此項消息是否屬實，如有其事，所謂遴選云者，係採何種方式，併希見示為幸，此頌儀祺，李曜林等一百餘人同拜啓」</p>

<h3>艾契遜對華政策　勃里奇要求調查　指為「不智·不友善」這行為</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十五日廣播：共和黨參議員勃里奇致函康納利，要求國會調查艾契遜反對加強軍事援華之政策，指艾氏此舉為「不智，不友善，不利的」行為。渠稱：艾氏所抱之立場可目為蓄意破壞國民黨之反共努力，並謂，國務院之政策，只知對付歐洲之共產主義，而置中國共產主義於不顧，實屬可怪。</p>

<h3>鐵路郵電運價資費每月調整二次　立法院通過修正辦法　數額今由政院討論明起實行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕政院咨請修正鐵路郵電運價及資費調整辦法案，十五日上午立院第三會期第十四次大會中，經激辨後，已照修正通過，自本月份起實行，原調整辦法四，成本指數乘戰前鐵路郵電費率，即為應行調整之運價資費，但在調整時，應酌量核減至少為百分之五十，十五日會中已通過政院之提議，將百分之五十改為百分之廿五。原調整辦法五「每月得調整一次，其指數上漲率，如不超過上次調整數百分之廿時，即不予調整。」十三日會中已通過政院提議，將每月調整一次改為每月得調整二次，討論時各委員之意見共分三張，一張主張根本不予調整，以張之江為代表。一派主張每月調整時，可以多加，但每月只應調整一次，以鄒樹文為代表。一派主張每月調整二次，以江一平為代表，最近經照江等意見通過。十五日會中李公權首先發言，主張可以多加，而不可太早，韓振聲對於政府貼補政策表示反對，認為貼補只有增加發行，徒刺激物價上漲。鄒樹文持相反意見，認為增加發行，固足以抬高物價，但公用事業漲價，尤足以刺激物價上漲，如公用事業十日加價一次，將加速整個經濟之崩潰。張之江更認為，公用事業調整價格不過是隨波逐流，無濟於事，政府應採取成本抑制物價辦法。楊不平亦認為公用事業加價太影響人民生活，主張不能加價。江一平則根據貼補與加價加以分析，謂貼補係由全國人民負担，而加價則僅一部分人受其影響，不如索興改為一月調整二次。喬鴻書·安輔廷·周雍能等均贊成江氏意見，主席提付表決，當獲得多數通過。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕鐵路運價資費調整辦法，經立院通過修正案後，其應調整之數額，業經交部擬定，政院定十六日舉行政務會議討論，一俟通過，即於十七日起實行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立院通過郵電鐵路運價資費每半月得調整一次後，聞電信部份已決定調整為五倍，電報每字由二百元增至一千元，較前增加四倍，俟十六日政務會通過後即實行。</p>
<h3>立院清理積案　定今開臨時會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕立院第三會期第十四次會議，十五日晨九時半舉行，童院長主席，決定十六日加開臨時會，清理積案，並定於下週三再開臨時會議，對總統所提審計長人選，行使同意權。旋討論議案：（一）行政院咨請修正鐵路郵電運價及資費調整辦法案（見另條），決議照原案修正通過。（二）本院財政金融委會報告審查修正財政金融改革案及其修正草案，李雲良·楊德昭·江一平·杜光塤·包華國·黃統等均先後發言，決議由財金委會推定委員重行審查，於十六日立院臨時會提出報告，再行討論，迄十二時散會。下午三時半繼續會議，吳委員延環等卅人提出緊急動議：「咨請政院迅速派飛機向新鄉空投糧食七百五十噸，並於一星期內開始，以振軍心，而維民命案」，經決議照案通過。旋繼續討論提案：（三）預算委會財金楊委員一峯等提議，全國公教人員待遇應迅予合理調整案，決議重付審查，於十六日大會時提出報告，再行決定。（四）法制委會報告審查行政院咨請覆議審計部組織法及審計處室組織條例案，（五）李雲良等提議，為維持全國經濟動脈之循環，擬具全國通航方案，請核議案，以上兩案經討論後，因在場委員不足法定人數，定十六日院會提付表決。</p>

<h3>江北又起局部戰鬬　共軍連續竄犯高橋被擊退　安慶亦有接觸平漢路平靜</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕一度沉寂之江北全綫，頃又展開局部戰鬬。十四日夜，鎮江以江大港對岸高橋頭堡，續遭陳毅部第二軍五千餘人竄犯，守軍在海軍砲艦每小時發砲二千餘發熾盛火網助戰下，激戰至十五日晨七時，國空軍亦經出動後，共軍卒告不支，向北退去，國軍因在和談期間未予追擊。另安慶方面共軍第十軍，於十四日夜再度向城東郊農業學校等國軍陣地發砲轟擊，經國軍還擊後，旋即平息。其餘江北各橋頭堡十五日皆無戰事。</p>
<p>〔本報鎮江十五日電〕鎮江當面各綫無戰事，共軍前哨在六圩以北三里之朱家旗桿，惟人數僅有一連，每至夜間，小股土幹不斷向圩外騷擾，并無接觸。又，在六圩東三里之都天廟，有共軍五百多人，據軍方消息，共軍主力向北撤退後，現在在施家橋以北布置陣綫，并架有山砲十數門，似有伺機向我進擊模樣。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十五日電〕軍息：（一）平漢正而孝感黃陂之綫仍在國軍防守中，連日雙方均無新動態。（二）鄂中鐵路以西頃又發現聶榮臻部共軍數千人活動，企圖未明。（三）鐵路以東林彪陳赓等部共軍，均維持原有態勢，各綫益趨沉寂，惟鄂東黃梅·廣濟間共軍一部，正向東南移動，似尚有聲援安慶模樣。</p>
<p>〔本報黃陂十五日電〕軍息：平漢前綫今平靜無事，惟路東長軒嶺一帶共軍續有增加。又，集結路西雲夢境內之共軍，經判明為聶榮臻部一個師，應山縣境風共軍兩個團，亦屬聶部。據北來旅客談，共軍指揮部現在信陽，該地運輸車輛多至一千餘部，共軍在豫南之部署至為忙碌。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十五日電〕長官公署發表：（一）安慶東面十四日晚六時許共軍砲兵向我農場以北龍獅橋陣地開砲十發，守軍傷亡二名，經予還擊後，砲聲始停。（二）安慶北面十四日深夜二時，共軍三四百向五里墩之綫陣地連續襲擊三次，均被守軍擊退，另股百餘人，同時向青峯嶺（龍王廟西）襲擊，亦被擊退。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕據某權威軍事觀察家語記者，自毛澤東十日下令停止軍事行動，迄今已達五日，期間在江北前綫雖有若干地區共軍已自動後撤，日昨一度亦全綫沉寂，然鑒於昨日入後江北又掀起局部戰事，及對太原復發動前所未有之猛烈攻勢，則此項所謂對政府代表謂業已頒發「停止軍事行動」之命令，實際上係一種「外交詞令」，而局部後撤之目的，亦無非藉此鬆懈國軍防務，消滅國軍鬥志，俾遂行其欲擒故縱虛虛實實而佔領國軍陣地，造成在利態勢之詭技，現國軍對此已提高警覺，嚴密戒備。</p>
<h3>襄河船隻多開回　武漢人心已安定</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口十五日電〕向長江南岸集中之襄河船隻，已有多艘開回襄河。開往蔡甸之班輪今亦照常行駛。當局雖未正式收回襄河船舶集中命令，但由於前綫沉寂，事實上已停止執行，故一度動盪之人心刻已漸趨安定。</p>
<h3>青島十一綏區　招待記者宣佈四事</h3>
<p>〔本報青島十五日電〕十一綏區司令部十四日下午九時招待記者，宣佈：（一）國防部近發國軍將士每人船洋兩元，應照大頭洋價格使用，不准拒用，否則犧牲一二奸商亦所不惜。（二）請各界滿意青島現狀，否則不妨請其赴共區或南方滬漢等地看看，並重申與青市新聞界公約六事。（三）擬組織記者訪問團赴前方訪問。（四）和談聲中，國軍早已停戰，此後如共軍來犯，為自衛計，當予還擊。諸事是綏區馮參謀長所主持宣佈</p>

<h3>社論　拋售政策的檢討</h3>
<p>近幾年來，各國中央銀行在公開市塲上的活動，倍覺活躍，足徵現代中央銀行控制市塲的重要性；最近我國中央銀行雖也曾參預了公開市塲的活動——如拋金銀，拋紗，拋糖，拋外匯移轉證等；但這些活動，與其說是為了完成它的金融使命，母寗說是想要達成它的財政目的，要確切得多。因為那是被動的，而不是主動的，是物資的消耗，而不是物資的運用，所以現階段中的拋售政策，除了加重金融上的紛擾以外，實際上是無裨於政策的本身。</p>
<p>本月四日，中央銀行在市塲上拋售的物資，單以黃金一項而論，就有六萬多兩。因之引起了銀根的突然緊縮，和市塲上空前的混亂現象；這種措施，雖然是「給予了一般投機家的致命打擊」（引用央行負責人談話）；但由是而引起的物價漲勢，顯然是無可抑制的。立法院對於這次漲風，也極為注意，曾於本月十二日院會中，向央行劉總裁提出熱烈的質詢，根據當時劉氏的答覆，認為「拋金目的，在於收縮通貨，抑制物價，且黃金係按市價拋售，買者無利可圖」·這一類的官樣文章，無論說得怎樣動聽，但是我們對於拋售政策的客觀看法，總無可原恕當局決策的錯映。</p>
<p>誠然，劉氏所表示的拋金政策，可以收縮通貨，抑制物價；但在當前非常的情勢下，我們以為決不可曲從理論，而否定現實的環境，我們目前財政的困難，及游資的猖獗，已是任何人感到觸目驚心的一件大事，此時若談到拋售政策，不論有多少的黃金·白銀·紗·糖·和外匯證等，恐怕都不容易收到多大的效果，因為財政和印鈔機不能分離的關係　所以儘管一面在拋售，另一面則在大量的放出資金，結果回籠的通貨，總抵不上放出新鈔的數字，以致在這一進一出之間，迭成了少數特殊份子發財的機會，而喪失了國家的權益。</p>
<p>次說中央銀行的操縱政策，始終不外乎「逢高拋出，逢低補進」的一貫方針，這也是它利用超等大戶的地位，以此所向無敵的姿態，把持市塲的　種方式，但這種覇道式的作風，是否即可使市面安定。物價低落。不無疑問。第一，目前各種物價的漲跌，大都與金融性的商品，發生連帶性的關係，現在金融性　商品，旣然有央行的哄抬，所以物價總是欣欣向榮，造成了普遍的看漲心理，而使投機家們更無忌憚，無往而不利。第二，各國公開市塲的所以成功，因為他們的中央銀行有控制利率，統制銀根的權能，同時他們不受通貨膨脹的牽制。，現在我國通貨惡性的膨脹，一般資金，都游離在金融圈外，對於上列條件，當然一件也不具備，試問政策怎能成功呢？僅以此兩點而論，也就可見當前拋售政策的害多利少了。</p>
<p>再以拋售政策實際運用而論，央行的拋售政策，無異鼓勵人民投機，金鈔的價格雖能抑平於曰時，但拋售一停漲風又起，所謂壓得愈重，反動也就愈烈，尤其對於無股可拋的證劵市塲，更是火上添油，從本月四日起，永安紗廠從每股十八元起，至昨日為止，竟漲至七十六元八角，在十二天內接連漲了八九個停板；甚至在央行拋售的時候，金鈔均小回，股票獨秀，依然漲停，不僅是證劵市塲中空前未有的漲風，而且也是對現行拋售政策的一個諷刺。試問金融當局對於股票投機市塲如火如荼的漲風，能不能也以「拋售」來抑制？</p>
<p>此外，尙有一端，値得當局注意，就是我國的財富因受八年抗戰四年內戰的影饗，早已損耗殆盡，那裏還有實力拋售？據監委熊在渭等調查中央銀行庫存的報告，「從二月二十八日起到現在，先後拋出的金銀等物，為數極鉅」。熊氏等雖沒有說明拋出的數目有多少，但我們確信總佔着一個不小的面額。要知今日中央銀行不斷拋出的金銀外匯物資等，雖有逢低吸進的時候，但仍不免要大部落在投機商人的手中。所以，我們建議當局，應該早日懸崖勒馬，趕快把金銀外匯向國外去掉換民生日用必需品，或生產所需的機器原料等，充實國力，那才是睿智的措施。「亡羊補牢」，時尙未晚，但願金融當局早作賢明的抉擇。</p>

<h3>聯合國全體大會議決　限制使用否決權　蘇聯集團一致投票反對　大西洋公約第一回合舌戰暫告結束</h3>
<p>〔路透社弗魯興草原十五日電〕聯合國大會昨以四十三對六票，決定五強在安理會中，非對某種極度重要之問題，不得使用否決權。蘇聯集團六國投反對票，印度及緬甸棄權。該決議案係由中英美法四國所提，除建議限制否決權之運用外，並規定安理會成立重大決議之前，應由五強先行交換意見。中英美法四國強調指出否決權之使用，必須加以限制，以免因濫用而使安理會陷入麻痺狀態。蘇聯代表則強調否決權為聯合國之基石，不容有所修改。渠提議召集安理會大國諮詢會議，以謀改善各大國一致決議之可能性，卒遭大會否決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十五日電〕蘇聯代表葛羅米柯昨晚在聯大中發表聲明，答覆英代表麥克尼爾及美代表奧斯汀之指責，並斥西方國家為「僞善」。關於北大西洋公約第一回合之舌戰現已結束，一部份代表希望此事在本屆會議中可告一段落。另一部份代表則稱，會期尚有一月，蘇聯代表必將乘機再教育施攻擊。</p>
<p>〔路透社弗魯興十四日電〕英首席代表麥克尼爾答辯葛羅米柯之抨擊，對葛氏之於討論否決權問題之際，以野蠻侵略的態度節外生枝，提出大西洋公約問題，殊令人感覺驚異。麥氏於向葛氏道賀其榮任蘇聯首席外次後，乃曰，葛氏之同僚連本人在內，原期葛氏升級以後，必能採用新的程序與方法，不幸葛氏的職務雖新，而方法仍舊。蘇聯如願發表對大西洋公約之意見，應設法將其列入聯大議程，而不應在討論其他問題之際，插入大西洋公約。葛氏當知大西洋公約祗具純粹的防禦性質，故祗有正在考慮侵略的國家能有反對該約的理由。</p>
<p>〔合眾社弗魯興十四日電〕美代表奧斯汀繼麥克尼爾之後發表演說稱，蘇外次葛羅米柯所控十二國聯盟乃針對蘇聯一節，「無合理根據」。渠繼稱，「公約乃最能保證和平之方法。此並非侵略工具，亦不能作侵略工具用，因為此公約乃根據聯合國憲章之目的及原則」。</p>
<h3>柯斯托夫免職纔旬日　保總理赴蘇養疴　鐵幕內情引起各方揣測　羅保波蘭三國駐南使節返任</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦十四日電〕保加利亞總理狄米特洛夫今日從政府首長及保共領袖兩職引退。西方外交家認為此乃蘇聯之巴洋幹帝國崩裂之徵象。</p>
<p>索菲亞方面官方宣稱，狄米特洛夫已獲准「返家休假」俾赴蘇聯受醫療。此事發生於狄米特洛夫之股肱柯斯托夫被免去副總理及經濟財政委會主席職會僅十天，且南斯拉夫方面秘密消息，盛傳保共已展開全面清黨工作。</p>
<p>宣佈狄米特洛夫「返家休假」之公報，係保共黨中央委員會及部長議會聯名發表。公報對於「返家休假」一詞，未予闡名，惟各方均知狄氏已患病，狄氏年六十有六，亦係蘇聯公民。同時另一公報宣佈柯斯托夫已被任命為保加利亞國立圖書館長。</p>
<p>狄米特洛夫去職之宣佈，已在巴爾幹局勢專家之間引起兩項問題，即（一）是否蘇聯另一衛星國將展翅飛去？（二）是否史達林與狄托之間，爭取以巴爾幹勢力之鬥爭已告擴大？官方公報，照例不說明詳情，亦不予解釋，但較諸去年狄托被逐出國際共産情報局後之任何事件，更能引人注意。狄托被逐出國際共産情報局以前，與狄米特洛夫頗友善，且對巴爾幹之前途，見解相同，均為巴爾幹或東歐聯邦之主要代表人。此項聯邦計劃，蘇方始終反對。狄米特洛夫於戰後試圖重行恢復此聯邦計劃，終不為蘇聯所許可。去年一月十七日，渠再行一次嘗試，於羅京招待新聞記者稱，東歐聯邦之成立，尚屬過早，但「適當時間，終將到來」。今日突然宣佈狄米特洛夫去職，顯係準備由曾在莫斯科受訓之柯拉洛夫暫時繼任代總理，柯拉洛夫現任副總理兼外長。</p>
<p>〔合眾社貝爾格勒十五日電〕據悉，羅保波蘭三國駐南使節，在離開貝爾格勒相當時期後，業已返此，但阿爾巴尼亞公使尚無返任消息，在最近數月中，各國使館幾乎人去樓空。據共情局方面稱，蘇聯大使不將召回，但可能更迭。捷克大使則已有新職務，但在最近將來，並無更迭新人的跡象。渠等稱，匈大使則已離任兩月。</p>
<h3>保人事變動　倫敦頗感驚奇　南國極為注意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十五日廣播：保加利亞共黨元老狄米特洛夫之突然宣布因病「告假」，此間巴爾幹問題專家極表驚奇。克林姆宮與狄托決裂之後，誠以此一發展最為重要。按本年二月間，共黨主持之「保加利亞祖國陣綫」曾發動清算「反人民份子」，三月間狄米特洛夫最親信之學生柯斯托夫突被免除保副總理之職務，而狄氏固早有以柯斯托夫為其繼任人之意。柯氏去職之原因，為有民族主義傾向，其「罪狀」正與狄托相同，而至今乃狄氏本人亦以赴蘇養疴聞。柯斯托夫去職後，狄氏從未在公開場合提及柯氏之名，故此間推測保國領袖或曾指摘狄氏事前未能阻止柯之轉變。目前最堪注意者，為保國是否即組新政府，而以新人代替狄氏，但此事或尚有若干躭擱，因保人早視狄氏為全國之導師，一時似不便更迭也。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十五日廣播：貝爾格勒訊，自保共領袖狄米特洛夫離此前往蘇聯後，南斯拉夫之狄托元帥已成為巴爾幹之唯一「巨頭」。南國方面預料今後共産國際情報局對於狄托及其支持者，將施更猛烈之攻擊。</p>

<h3>石膏神像　居然落淚</h3>
<p>紐約垃圾桶邊拉扮演神話</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約雪辣柯斯十四日電〕此間十一歲女孩安納，昨夜由垃圾桶中拾起一石膏神像聖安之頭親其前額，觀眾數百人，多謂曾見該像眼中一再流淚，他人親之則並無反應。天主教士富法洛自言曾目睹此事，殊覺不可思議。另有教士兩人，亦嘗見之。安納為此間送牛奶者之長女，全家均係天主教徒，昨夜因表演此奇蹟達數小時，幾至精疲力盡。聖安則為聖母馬利亞之母。據紐約阿爾弗萊大學陶器學院院長麥瑪洪，用電話告記者稱，就科學立場言，神像之流淚似屬可能。石膏吸收水份甚易，但除由蒸發外並不放出。</p>

<h3>東柏林建議放鬆封鎖　恢復東西間貿易　西區市長率直予以拒絕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十五日廣播：柏林訊，柏林蘇佔區之市長愛勃脫十四日建議放寬蘇方之封鎖，俾西柏林之工廠得自蘇佔區得到原料，而其製成品亦得運往蘇區。惟西柏林市長路德對此已表拒絕。路德並表示，蘇方封鎖應即全部解除，並在蘇佔區舉行自由選舉，然後始能恢復東西柏林之貿易。柏林共黨報紙對路德之態度痛加指斥，並稱，對西柏林人民而言，東西貿易實屬急需。此間觀察家稱，放鬆蘇方封鎖之議，並非表示蘇方願意和平，而實為蘇方企圖藉此增加東柏林之生産，因西方國家拒絕以原料運往東德後，蘇佔區之生産實已大受影響。</p>

<h3>發薪現鈔部份流入行莊　市工業會理監向國行交涉獲結果　七百億決直接領發　統算各業配額後彙總領現</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市工廠發薪所需現鈔，中央銀行雖允搭發半數，由國行於十五·十六·十八三日內供應現鈔九百億元，但因國行堅持須交由各行莊代領，致昨日國行寬放存款提現三成之現鈔二百億元，雖由各行莊領去，惟各工廠我未領到。而昨日物價飛漲，工人羣向廠方索取現鈔，廠方均感無法應付。</p>
<p>市工業會特於昨下午二時召開臨時理監事會，討論結果，全體理監事由東雲章·洪念祖·歐陽崙等領銜，赴中央銀行請願，鵠候一小時許，該行業務局林局長始出接談。</p>
<p>據林局長報告：本日除發給行莊現鈔二百億元外，並搭有本票二百億元。此外另有現鈔一百億元則發給各國營事業。茲各行莊所領之現鈔二百億元，既不能到達各工廠，唯有望地方當局設法開導銀錢業，並望市社會局曹局長負起責任。至今日（十六日）及十八日應發之現鈔七百億元，因行莊既不守諾言於前，決全部扣下，撥交工業會分配。計十六日三百億元，十八日四百億元。其辦法為先由工業會計算各業配額後，向各關係行莊開發國行支票，由各公會背書後彙總向國行領現。</p>
<p>市工業會各代表獲得此項解決辦法後，即由歐陽崙·洪念祖·田和卿·蔡聽濤·郭永熙等五人連夜依照各業公會所造報發付工資工人名冊計算，每業應攤得現鈔，計平均工人每名可得現鈔十五萬五千二百七十六元，但因國行須分兩天提領（十六日三百億元，十八日四百億元），故十六日僅能提七分之三，十八日提七分之四。取現手續，由各業根據工業會配額，向往來行莊開發國行支票，由各業公會背書證明後，彙齊各該業支票向國行取款。聞今日國行付款辦公時間，將延長至下午五時為止。各業應攤取之現鈔額，由工業會於今晨專函各業公會週知。</p>
<h3>行莊尅扣發薪現鈔　當局決予澈查追究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市府秘書長陳良，以昨日國行籌措發薪之鉅額現鈔，結果未能直達工人之手，表示極為震怒。渠認為若干行莊於撥到現鈔後，加以尅扣，使之流入貼水市場，造成貼現二成之嚴重情形，實足以擾亂金融，危害民生，決加以追究澈查。陳秘書長認為生活指數上漲乃物價暴跳之果，而非因，故謂今日之各種物價因受生活指數影響而上漲，實屬極不合理。一般奸商故意以此抬價，使市民受害，當局決予合理管制。對於本市若干行莊之尅扣現鈔者，當局決採斷然行動，必要時將加以逮捕，並以戒嚴法懲處。</p>

<p>江防戰急劇進行中　訪安慶前線（上）  本報記者　劉蝟　　〔本報安慶十二日訊〕安慶乃長江名城，亦是磐石。宅在國軍海陸空配合作戰下，迄今苦戰二十餘日，依然雄踞大江之濱，安如泰山，屹立未動。　　今日八桂子弟兵，在安慶以「守必堅」粉碎共軍「攻必克」的信心，寫下江防戰之輝煌戰功。它不但可與中外聞名的抗戰時期的長沙會戰及衡陽四十七天保衛戰媲美，更是國軍海陸空配合協調的一次立體戰的成功。　　記者迭次得到八綏區徐啓明副司令官暨黃冠南少將，李興，韓慕軒上校等協助，以三日的行程，由九江進抵國軍橋頭堡的名城—安慶。　　公路泥濘難行　記者這次由九江進入苦戰兼旬的名城，在短短的一百八十公里旅程上，竟費時三天，於十二日下午六時抵達城外，適因已屆禁止行人進城的戒嚴時間，乃商由守軍政工處長鮑士琦上校，派陳幹事出城引接，始克進城。在皓月高懸下，槍砲的交響中，漫遊江畔名城，看到安謐如恒的城內景色，頓使旅途疲勞的我，精神為之一爽。　　自九江到安慶，現在唯一的安全交通綫，全恃一條搶修了的公路，因為共軍進擾華陽後，水上交通遭受阻隔，除海軍艦艇尚能以砲火通過共軍的阻碍外，其他船隻現僅能在九江彭澤間照江防規定航行，但除軍差的船隻外，在九江以東的浩瀚長江，因軍事關係，只有見白浪滾滾，却不見帆輪的影子。　　九江到安慶的公路，全程凡一百八十公里，因係臨時搶修，僅有一條單行道的泥漿路，路面坎坷不平，如遇天雨，更其難行，即技術高明的司機，亦均視為畏途。　　訪守將吳中堅　記者進入安慶城後，第一件事便是拜訪守將吳中堅師長。他住的地方，正是工事核心地帶。經過若干層的街巷堡壘，在一所洋式的院子裏，從窗帘中傳出鋼琴聲，原來我們的安慶守將吳師長正在彈奏「戰爭中求和平」的歌曲。　　吳師長給記者的印象是短小精悍。他對一個陌生的新聞記者，沒有官氣，也不是一個老粗。他對於每件事或一個問題，都能以理智來分析，所以我們從國共和談，安慶守備戰談到最近世界大勢。他堅信要自己有辦法，有力量，才能求得真正和平。就以國共和談而論，假如安慶橋頭堡守備戰，有了逆轉的變化，那末共黨的所謂「和平外衣」早已撤到江南。　　「小諸葛」攻勢　他很滿意於這次海陸空協調作戰的成功與安慶人民的協助，同時他亦滿意於共黨劉伯承的攻勢，能夠使他有更好的機會，以少數的兵力與多至五倍以上的共軍，寫下國軍在安慶橋頭堡守備戰的輝煌戰果。他說：劉伯承「安慶之戰」中共軍的指揮官，是共軍的一位名將，有「獨眼龍」「小諸葛」之稱，而吳師長自己承認是個矮小而尚未成名的國軍師長，以他今日的地位與劉伯承死拼硬打，若是守備安慶成功，打垮劉伯承，那末，我們的矮子師長吳中堅少將，亦就成名了。　　劉伯承在合肥向他的進攻安慶的部隊訓話，說：這次你們去接收安慶吧！又說：若是不能好好的打個勝仗，就不用回來了！就是共軍一一A軍長杜義德本月六日七日給吳師長的信，亦明白說出，是奉命接收安慶。那末今日安慶仍在國軍保衛下平安吉慶，事實告訴我們，是誰打勝仗了。杭州！你該抬頭！　摒除富兒們的憐惜與垂青  本報特派員　儲裕生　　〔本報杭州十三日訊〕天堂中的人們的心情雖是異常的沉重，特價的高漲雖像一塊重鉛似的壓抑得使人喘不過氣來，但是來杭州遊春的人到還不算少。滬杭鐵路雖沒有像去年樣的加駛遊春專車，然而在幾次車後也加掛了車輛。不過盛景已不比往年了，所掛的車輛已不是考究的頭等車，而僅是差強人意的二等車，在這裏可以看出載來的人的經濟景況。上等旅館如西冷，大華，新新等不常客滿，西子湖濱的西湖，湖濱，環湖也不見得擁擠，只是一些三四等的旅館，倒很熱鬧。茶館也是如此，樓外樓，太和園，不如往年樣的排隊候吃，門前雖也有轎車與划子，但並不是擁塞在外西湖的馬路上。　　在各名勝區，坐下來喝茶的很少，僅是溜躂溜躂。　　袁大頭猖獗　京滬一帶的人，都是帶些冒險性的中下級商人，他們雖然也念念念不忘杭州，而仍舊到杭州來玩，但是他們必須要計算自己的行囊。普通一個人到杭州來玩趟，旅館每天總要一個袁大頭，吃飯每頓也要一個袁大頭，黃包車費總要兩個袁大頭，雇划子每天要五個袁大頭，每天共總用去要六七個袁大頭。公務員，文化界，教育界的人士，根本沒有能力到杭州來，即是中下級商人也要考慮考慮，無怪他們變成了一股吝嗇的樣子。　　洋洋乎盈耳　提起袁大頭，它在杭州猖獗已達極點，政府原指定在城站，水漾橋，眾安橋三個地方為銀元市場，但是水漾橋已擴展到整個清泰街，清泰街為交通要道，每天都擠得水洩不通。城站也是如此，眾安橋也是如此，現在銀洋買賣幾發展在每一條的馬路上：延齡路，英士路，湖濱路都有鏘鏘之聲，洋洋乎盈耳。警察有一個時間干涉過，但也干涉不好，只有隨他去做銀洋買賣了。最近，在吃食店中，也有買賣銀洋的人來做交易，名勝區如靈隱，岳墳，甚至九溪十八澗，都有做銀洋買賣的販子。很多來遊春的客人，都帶了銀洋，向他們掉換，因為覺得金圓券的不值錢，銀洋的值錢，所以掉得了金圓券後，自然省吃儉用，以免多多掉去銀洋，這當然是今年春汛欠旺的一個心理因素。　　靠春汛生活　今年的春汛，很顯然的不及往年，很多靠着春汛生活一年的人，都在呌苦失望。他們埋怨着時局的不靖，否則巨商大賈必然齊來，也可以稍稍鬆一口氣。但是杭州有他杭州的價值，杭州不能永遠是一個被人玩賞的消費都市，他應該自己站起身來，抬起頭來，摒棄一切有錢人的憐惜垂青。他應該使人們來到這裏，帶回去無比的「精神食糧」，他應該使人們感覺杭州是不能或缺唯一修養的地方。　　杭州啊！你雖有嬌豔的外表，但必須要有豐富的內容，或可免於陷入被人高興時玩賞與不高興時遺棄的慘境。袖珍新聞　　鎮江　〔本報訊〕省保安司令部為確保鎮市治安，飭有城防指揮部十四日起通知江邊及江南運河內所有船舶，一律退出市區，據悉在市區內之船隻，計在二千隻以上。十四日已由省保安第二團派員監督疏散至辛豐鎮以南三十里之江南運河內。　　蘇州　〔本報訊〕吳江縣嚴墓區南麻鄉，有盛澤柳姓墳堂一所，自民國二十六年起柳姓族中均避難去港，十數年來已無人前往掃墓，墳客許金奎竟異想天開，將柳姓墳墓掘開，發現楠木棺材一口，上有「道光八年勅封一品夫人柳沈氏」字樣，許認為中必有寶物，將其劈開，乃一女屍身御鳳冠霞珮，服裝猶新，屍體尚未腐化，一時轟動全鄉，往觀者不絕，然許金奎早已逃避無踪，當局已派員調查真相。　　〔又訊〕金雞湖沉屍案中之另一妨害風化部份，廿三日已告終結，王兆民宣判無罪。　　崑山　〔本報訊〕崑吳交界角直鎮自衛團負責人謝國安，（淪陷時曾任僞警局長，）因有某項嫌疑，被當局逮捕。帶縣偵訊。　　金壇　〔本報訊〕本邑十二日晚八時許，斷絕交通，突擊抽查戶口，捕獲未辦戶口移動及無身分證者三百餘人，解城防指揮部偵訊中。　　紹興　〔本報訊〕本縣十日及十一日平水車頭及三七開界五百崗漓渚並嵊縣小江及蘭亭鄉，有不明番號之部隊百餘人，或二三百人及四百餘人不等，意圖進犯模樣，並將小江車站焚毀，蘭亭鄉公所公文被焚，情況嚴重。城中戒嚴，現經駐軍吳軍長率勁旅追擊中。　　吳興　〔本報訊〕離北門二里許老娘婆橋曾玉林家，於十二日深夜，突來盜匪十多人，將全家大小綁住，不許聲張，任意搜刦，歷二小時，所有食米以及細軟衣服，洗刧一空，用舟裝載向北面逸去。當局現飭屬協緝。　　海甯　〔本報訊〕本縣各鄉鎮去年度征兵欠額尚夥，縣府十五日起發征集票，限令月底前征足。　　〔又訊〕城廂社會服務處十六日正式成立，內設飲館·公寓·同時開業。社會服務浦東連橋農村托兒所近況　　浦東周浦連橋農村托兒所，自於本年兒童節成立後，初步種痘工作已告完成。現正繼續進行家庭訪問及兒童登記等工作。該所工作目標，為使每一兒童之身心，均得正常發展，為人生建立良好基礎。同時使每一兒童之父母能提高生産情緒，增進生産效能。從而使每一家庭均能健康愉快，和諧向上。該所教導原則為着重生活教育，使理論與實踐打成一片，啓發重於管教，着重個性發展，該所成立後，賴全體仝人通力合作，有力出力，有錢出錢，促成地方全面協調，致力地方建設。　　又該所創立伊始，經費困難，亟需各界協助與指導。（本市通訊處郵箱八八一號）徵求人才　　中華職業教育社上海職業指導所，近受各方委託特色下列人才，凡願應徵者，請往雁蕩路八十號該所面洽。（一）某廠女會計員一人，需大學商學院畢業，擅長成本會計，能英語，懂廣東話者為合格，服務地點在香港。（二）台灣某食品廠製麵包及西點技師數人。（三）本市某診癤所産科學習生一人，以初中畢業，年齡在十七與二十歲間之女性為合格。服務簡報　　家庭教師待聘　（一）許緝平，徐家匯交大肄業，廣元路雲裳邨二號洽。（二）王幻真，福煦路五五三號洽。（三）熊奇侯，浦東楊思中學梅孟林轉洽。　　口琴廉讓　方兆奎君願以全新和來（ECHO）C調口琴一只廉讓，銅仁路文德里五〇號洽。　　讓書　茲有一九四七年美國出版世界交響名曲指南“Concert　Companion”一部（全新），願照定價八折出讓，有意者請函長壽支路三十五弄廿三號陳君洽。　　找尋失物　嚴魯璧君於本月八日在西摩路威海衛路口失落小型白色玻璃包一只，希拾得者擲還圓明路一六九號五二〇室，當致薄酬。</p>

<p>自由談買進賣出記  以是　　二姐是個不夠貪污資格的小公務員，因為沒有家庭負擔，每月的薪水，除了她個人刻苦的午飯與車資外，却總能多餘一些。九個月來，這幾個可憐的一些兒，已漸漸積大了。二姐因鑒于大頭與物價必齊飛，可以保全幣值，買賣又是便利，於是購進了八枚大頭。那是三月中旬的事。　　不久，二姐忽然從局裏聽來一套銀元生意經，就是每逢月之廿九買進，一等月底生活指數發表，然後在三號賣出，放拆息。到十三號，第二次生活指數未發表前再買進，十七號賣出，再放息，如此周而復始，若能代入這公式，就能賺錢。　　於是，二姐召集了個圓桌會議，大哥·大姐和我被邀出席，討論這公式是否合理，並研究其得失。大家發言後，歸納到一點：這公式是黑吃黑，因為指數發表後大家都發着了薪水，薪水又大多數去換銀元，於是銀元漲。以後因為要用，都陸續賣出，銀元不會漲，反而是放息合算。結果，四人都認為這公式是正確可靠，於是會議閉幕，八枚大頭也決定代入公式。　　三四〇二倍的生活指數，由報童口裏宣佈了開來，銀元直綫上昇，一萬五，一萬九，四月二日達二萬一千元。二姐以為高峯已到，即使再漲也漲不了多少，於是立刻拋出，共是十六萬八千元，找熱人拆放。　　人生是個萬花筒，變化萬千。　　四月三日，大頭再晉，二萬二；五日到二萬五，日漲夜大，漫無止境，拆息却徘徊於六七角元間，四月八日，一「頭」當先，入四萬六千元，漲了一倍有餘，二姐的心跳差一點兒與頭跳看齊，眼看着一些一些的蝕下去，實在忍無可忍，只得毅然停止拆放，本息全部收回，共是二十七萬元，買進了六枚大頭，總算心定。　　仔細算一算，鈔票的數字增加了十萬二，與孫悟空的筋斗差不了多少。錢是賺了，可是拿銀元算來，八枚變六枚，短了二枚，又算是蝕了。到底是賺是蝕，公式沒有回答。　　據說二姐已不再有做生意的妄想了。二枚大頭易了手，已很夠個教訓。　　「買進賣出大小頭」，幾人歡樂幾人愁，我不禁為二姐呌屈。指數與崩  立　　四月份上半月的生活指數，昨天發表了，是一五一四〇倍。一五一四在電報明碼裏是個什麼字呢？恰巧是個「崩」字。　　異哉！難道生活指數編製委員會諸公，也都讀過劉伯溫的燒餅歌麼？　　發篋得故徐又錚上將軍舊貽詩軸因念及其公子道鄰兄漫成三絕句示之  瘦鵑　　（一）當年豪氣自縱橫，知汝胸中有甲兵。記否秋風紅葉下，聯翩策寨上天平？　　（二）君登廊廟成英器，我似深山退院僧；歷刦情腸寒已久，空餘酸淚結紅冰。　　（三）盱衡世事　千辛，何處桃源好避秦？建國卅年徒擾擾，九原難慰老成心。蘇聯音樂會　在蘭心行舉  芬　　本星期日（四月十七日）下午五時，蘭心大戲院將舉行一個蘇聯音樂會，有管弦樂隊（二十人）和會唱隊（六十人）參加演奏。樂曲有俄羅斯的民歌，和蘇聯新作家的音樂作品。樂隊和合唱的指揮，都是由女音樂家戈魯比雅特妮珂娃担任。這樂隊和合唱隊，本來經常在蘇聯僑民協民的體育館舉行，雖然演奏的都是業餘音樂家，但由於修養的高深和訓練的良好，成績常常出於意料。這次到蘭心公演，是要使他們的音樂聽眾不限於蘇聯僑民，進而至於擴大到全上海的中外音樂愛好者。吝嗇與貪財  袁和仁　　最有錢的人，也就是最吝嗇的人，這是人類的惡性。現在我說一個最有錢也是最吝嗇的人的故事。　　海蒂葛琳，曾一度為美國最有錢的女人，她的資產可能有一億美金。可是她的生活，不論衣·食·住·行，較一個每星期賺四元薪金的傭婦都還節儉，雖然她每分鐘有五元美金的收入。　　在寒冷的冬天，她常常把自己埋在舊報紙中取暖。她買下了兩條鐵路的全部股票，幾乎美國每條鐵路都有她的份，可是當她出門時，決不肯去享受頭等車的舒適，却情愿在三等車裏。兩分錢買來的一張晨報，在讀完後，她立刻會托賣報的減價轉賣出去。　　某次，她請朋友吃飯，請他們在波士頓最大的飯店大廳中等候她。誰都以為這次總是盛宴了，賓客們都穿了最漂亮的晚禮服去赴會。可是等到主人來了，就立刻領他們走出大飯店，跑進對面一家平民食堂，請他們吃二角五分一客的經濟客飯。她平時常常到平民食堂去吃飯的，化三分錢吃一盤豆子，二分錢吃一碗雜和湯。逢到她的生日，方肯吃一客經濟客飯。　　一八九三年一個熱炎的夏天，太陽晒得像火一般熱，可是海蒂葛琳仍舊躲在從她父親手中繼承過來的貨倉擱樓上工作。工作什麼呢？在從各色各樣的破布堆裏，把白色的檢出來，因為檢出一磅白碎布，就可從舊貨販中取得一分錢的工資。　　她為了逃避收稅員，每天無固定住處，但時常能在小客棧中看到她，穿着破爛的衣服，帶了極少的行李，所以小客棧的老闆娘常常要他先付錢呢！　　她老是怕騙子假冒簽她的名，所以非不得已，她決不簽名。她把所有的舊信封都保存起來，利用舊信封翻面再用。　　她死時年八十一歲。當她命已垂危時，照顧她的看護，醫院不叫她們穿白制服，只穿普通衣服。這樣，海蒂葛琳就會以為她們只是普通女僕。這位老太太如果知道她們是昂價的護士時，那麼她就是死了，也不瞑目的。十萬貫  蕭亢石　　古人詩，有：「腰緾十萬貫，騎鶴上揚州」之句。　　在古時有十萬貫錢，可稱富庶；「騎鶴上揚州」，又如何等快樂！　　可是現在的「十萬金圓」，能值幾何？衹可買半柞大頭！　　「腰緾十萬貫」，在今日之下，何罕之有？半塊大頭，還響不起叮噹之聲呢！最怪的字典  毓　　十六世紀時，維也納有一種最古怪的字典，可謂空前絕後。它的編纂目的是便利外來遊客。其內容包含全市上等妓院的名稱地址。該字典又包括當時全市成年女人五分之一的芳名。姿態美  景欣　　婦女們大都是愛美的。畫眉，傅粉，塗脂，點唇，刷頭髪，修指甲，每天總要費很多時間在這些事情上面。還要穿着漂亮貼身的衣裳，以顯示她苗條的身段。但美國美容專家弗蘭多小姐，却批評這種種都是美容的錯覺。　　弗蘭多小姐是白里遜學院的美容教師，她每星期總要接觸二百以上的女子，她們都想到列入美女之羣的。可是據她評判的結果，能夠及格的，不過廿多個人。大多數的女子，總有些缺點。也許在外貌上是很美了，但在姿態上總嫌嬌揉做作。然則，照弗蘭多小姐的觀點，要如何才能符合美的條件呢？她說：女子能帶一些男性的性格，會增加不少嫵媚。現在一般女子，不論是二三人的談話中，或是數十百人的宴會中，總覺得有些做作。不是過份地多言客套，就是羞答答地訥訥寡言，不像男子們顯示得自然而大方。不過男性化也不能太過份了。太多運動的女子，腿部肌肉特別發達，走起路來傲視闊步，完全像一個大丈夫，這也會失掉她的媚態。　　所謂男性的性格，是指男性的優點而言，像在人前會自然地伸出他的手，從容的談吐，善於應付朋友，顯示他的英俊，寬大，等等。至於男子的魯葬，粗暴，那是男性的缺點，自然不宜於女子模仿的，否則便會成了母夜叉了。　　弗蘭多女士最後的結論是說：現在的小姐們，徒知外貌上的美麗，而忽視態度的自然和大方，這是很大的錯誤。女子在外貌上，天賦比男子強；而姿態上，却有不如男子之處。若能採取男子的優點，來彌補女子的缺陷，在姿態上，向男子學習一點，則不是更盡善盡美了麼？</p>

<h3>Continued Peace Talks in Beiping: River Crossing Issue Remains Central Point of Discussion. Huang Shao-hong Didn't Return to Nanjing Yesterday; Yu Youren Postpones Trip North</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The peace talks continue in Beiping. Huang Shao-hong has not returned to Nanjing as of the 15th. He telegraphed here in the afternoon of the 15th, stating that meetings continued on the 14th and 15th, and several issues have not yet been agreed upon. He also expressed his hope that Yu Youren would wait for his return to Nanjing to exchange views before flying to Beiping. However, it was not known as of the evening of the 15th whether Mr. Huang could return to Nanjing on the 16th. It is rumored that the reason for Mr. Huang's delay may be that the opinions recently brought by the government encountered some difficulties after being presented, causing the peace talks that had already begun to be hindered, making it impossible to reach a concrete conclusion for reference. According to reports, Mr. Huang had originally decided to return to Nanjing on the 15th. When Zhang Zhizhong spoke to this place on the phone on the morning of the 15th, he stated that Mr. Huang would come to Nanjing in the afternoon, but this did not happen. Therefore, people in Nanjing have some concerns about this.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Just as Yu Youren and his entourage were ready to depart, they suddenly received a phone call from Zhang Zhizhong on the morning of the 15th, requesting that they wait until after Huang Shao-hong arrived in Nanjing for a meeting before starting their journey, thus delaying the trip. Mr. Yu held two meetings with his entourage at his official residence on the morning and evening of the 15th, discussing some details. When Mr. Yu met with reporters late at night on the 15th, he could not give a definite statement on his departure date, but since the 17th is his seventy-first birthday, he could not leave on the 16th and might postpone it until after the 17th. Furthermore, it has recently been decided to add Supervisory Committee member Wang Xinling to the list of those flying with Mr. Yu.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Reliable sources revealed on the 15th regarding the progress and key issues of the peace talks, saying that the eight conditions used as the basis are no longer an obstacle to the peace talks. Conversely, the issue of President Chiang's whereabouts and the crossing of the Yangtze River by the communist army are the most difficult and urgent preconditions that need to be resolved. It is said that the communist side believes that although President Chiang has retired, his potential power is still very strong. Therefore, the current deployment of the national army and the cooperation of the authorities still appear to involve President Chiang's participation in command. During the peace talks, in order to reduce obstacles to the peace talks, the issue of President Chiang's whereabouts should be studied. As for the issue of crossing the Yangtze River, the communist side believes that in order to ensure peace talks, the communist army must cross the Yangtze River, which has a military significance and is related to order in the rear, especially pointing out the condition of "rampant secret agents in the rear." They have studied ways of crossing the river, intending to abandon armed attacks and take a peaceful crossing. The government feels quite troubled by the above two difficulties, because President Chiang's whereabouts were announced when he announced his retirement, and he has retired to his hometown of Xikou, repeatedly expressing that he does not interfere in politics. It is now clear that he is not personally handling and commanding military and political affairs. Regarding the crossing of the Yangtze River, the government has long believed that crossing the river would affect the peace talks. If the communist army crosses the river, it will be easily threatened when resolving various issues. The government delegation has been negotiating with the communist representatives based on this attitude, but has not yet reached a conclusion or any concessions. Some pessimistic people are very worried about this. After thorough discussions on the eight conditions between the government representatives and the communist representatives, the standards have been greatly relaxed. The communist side no longer insists on the issue of war criminals, but the phrase "investigate war responsibility" must be included when the peace treaty is established in the future. Regarding legitimacy, the Republic of China has been recognized as the legal name for the future. According to authoritative sources, the communist side in principle does not allow changes to the eight conditions, that is, the conditions must exist, but the content can have the maximum degree of flexibility to reduce difficulties. It is rumored that during the pre-meeting exchange of views, Zhang Zhizhong's first four-hour conversation with Mao Zedong on the 8th was the most important. As of now, the central government's attitude is still within the scope of the decisions made during the negotiations on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Differing Opinions on North-South Navigation; Legislative Yuan to Discuss Again Today; Ministry of Economic Affairs Revises Plan for North-South Exchange of Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The North-South Navigation Proposal submitted by Legislator Li Yunliang was brought up for discussion at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 15th. First, Legislator Li explained the main points of the proposal, stating that the proposal for navigation has five reasons: to relieve people's livelihood, protect navigation rights, save foreign exchange, facilitate postal services, and adapt to the situation. The most important thing is that this proposal is an urgent measure to solve the current financial and economic crisis. Currently, the north has surplus coal, salt, soybeans, peanuts, cooking oil, fertilizer, cotton, caustic soda, cement, and other industrial raw materials that can be supplied to the south, while the south has surplus tea, sugar, cigarettes, matches, and industrial products that also need the northern market. This requires navigation to connect them. Since January, ten ships, including "Da Shanghai" and "Tangshan," have transported coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai without any malfeasance. However, because shipping lines from Shanghai to Tianjin and other ports have not yet opened, many foreign ships are taking over our navigation rights. Mr. Li also clarified the general belief that "navigation should not be opened before peace is achieved," and he believes that the Communist Party also has the sincerity to open navigation. After Mr. Li's report, Chen Guyuan, Sun Guiji, Zou Shuwen, and others spoke, all strongly emphasizing the necessity of navigation and supporting Mr. Li's proposal. However, some people also submitted written opinions against it. The meeting adjourned at 3:15 p.m. without a result and is scheduled to be brought up for discussion and voting again on the 16th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has revised the plan for the exchange of goods between the north and the south again and has decided to start with a small number of goods for trial implementation, exchanging flour for coal, yarn for cotton, and cigarettes for tobacco leaves. After the trial implementation has good results, the scope of exchange will be expanded. In addition to merchants handling it themselves, the China Trust Bureau can also participate. The port for the exchange will still be limited to Tianjin, and ships will be reviewed by the Ministry of Communications. This method will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion and decision.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Chinese National Products Merchants Federation, previously jointly telegraphed the central authorities regarding the exchange of goods between the north and the south, making some suggestions. Yesterday, he received a reply from Guo Jinwu, the central representative in Beiping, which said, "To President Xiaolai of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Factory Federation, Director Du Yuesheng of the Shipowners Association, President Liu Hongsheng of the General Industrial Association, and Mr. Wei Wenhan: I have received your message with respect. Protecting national industry and commerce is the established policy of the liberated areas. If the goods traveling between Tianjin and Shanghai can be proven to be domestic products, the authorities will approve the exemption of import and export taxes to facilitate exchange. I hereby reply, Guo Jinwu bows respectfully."</p>
<h3>The Three Legislators Going to Beiping are Purely a Private Trip; Tong Guanxian Announced at the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Regarding the matter of Legislator Li Yaolin and others sending a letter to President Tong, President Tong replied at the 14th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 15th. Regarding the issue of the attitude of legislators' speeches, Mr. Tong said: We came to Nanjing for a meeting with the aim of seeking unity and striving for peace. I hope that all members will unite in the spirit of sharing the same boat. As for the speeches of each member, everyone has freedom and cannot be stopped. As for the report that the Legislative Yuan selected three people to participate in the peace talks, it is not true. This time, President Yu's trip to Beiping is in a private capacity, and the accompanying legislators were also privately invited by Mr. Yu. I did not participate in any opinions. The three legislators are also going in a private capacity and do not represent the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Legislators Sent a Letter to President Tong, Requesting Effective Maintenance of Order in the Meeting Place</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Legislators Li Yaolin, Yang Gongda, Wu Yanhuan, Song Yishan, Shao Jingren, Liu Zhendong, and more than 100 others, because of the speech of a certain member when the 12th meeting of this month discussed the arrest of members Xu Kaitian and Jin Shaoxian, was sternly stopped by one or two members, and at the same time, a chorus of boos arose in the meeting place, and the newspaper reported that the Legislative Yuan selected three colleagues to participate in the peace talks, specially sent a letter to President Tong on the 14th, making some suggestions and inquiries. The letter was presented to President Tong in person on the 15th. The original text is as follows: "President Guanxian, in today's situation where the country is in turmoil and danger, the colleagues of this Yuan will not evade their responsibilities to the country and the nation. The enthusiasm of the number of people reporting to this session, the tension of the mood, and the establishment of important proposals can all be clear evidence that the colleagues are doing their best to fulfill their responsibilities, and it is appropriate to be harmonious and harmonious to achieve complete success. Unexpectedly, when the 13th meeting of the 12th of this month discussed the arrest of members Xu and Jin, all colleagues had no objection in principle to the point of requesting the authorities to punish the responsible personnel. The only difference was that there were slight differences in the text and tone. However, there were one or two members who did not allow others to speak, and their attitude was arrogant and their momentum was overwhelming, which was already unbearable. Moreover, there were even those who added insults, which was almost insulting. As a dignified representative of the people, on the sacred podium, they were so失态. The colleagues expressed their regret. They originally intended to correct it at the time, fearing that in the emotional excitement of each other, causing emotional unhappiness would be even more of a loss to this Yuan. For this reason, I am writing to ask Mr. to pay special attention. If such incidents occur again, it must be effectively stopped, otherwise the order of the meeting place will be impossible to maintain, and the dignity of the parliament will be swept away. It is also heard that the Yishi Daily in this city reported on the 13th that this Yuan selected three colleagues to participate in the peace talks, and they are about to go north, etc. Whether this news is true, and if so, what method is used for the so-called selection, and I hope to see the instructions for good fortune. Li Yaolin and more than 100 others respectfully initiated"</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 15th] Peng Fuzhong, Huang Keqin, and Xu Shaosheng, who were arrested in Xixian for the Xu Wentian case, were released and returned to Xixi on the 14th due to insufficient suspicion.</p>
<h3>Acheson's China Policy; Bridges Demands Investigation; Calls it "Unwise, Unfriendly" Behavior</h3>
<p>[News Agency] Washington, 15th Broadcast: Republican Senator Bridges sent a letter to Connally, requesting that Congress investigate Acheson's policy of opposing strengthening military aid to China, calling Acheson's move "unwise, unfriendly, and unfavorable." He said: Acheson's position can be seen as deliberately undermining the Kuomintang's anti-communist efforts, and said that the State Department's policy only knows how to deal with communism in Europe and ignores communism in China, which is strange.</p>

<h3>Railway, Postal, and Telecommunications Freight Rates and Fees Adjusted Twice a Month; Legislative Yuan Passes Amendment; Amount to be Discussed by Executive Yuan Today and Implemented Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Executive Yuan's proposal to amend the railway, postal, and telecommunications freight rates and fee adjustment methods was passed as amended after heated debate at the 14th meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 15th and will be implemented from this month. The original adjustment method was 4: the cost index multiplied by the pre-war railway, postal, and telecommunications rates is the freight rate and fee to be adjusted, but the adjustment should be appropriately reduced by at least 50%. The meeting on the 15th passed the Executive Yuan's proposal to change 50% to 25%. The original adjustment method was 5: "It can be adjusted once a month, and the index increase rate will not be adjusted if it does not exceed 20% of the last adjustment amount." The meeting on the 13th passed the Executive Yuan's proposal to change the monthly adjustment to twice a month. During the discussion, the opinions of the members were divided into three categories: one category advocated that no adjustments should be made at all, represented by Zhang Zhijiang; one group advocated that more additions can be made during monthly adjustments, but only one adjustment should be made per month, represented by Zou Shuwen; one group advocated that two adjustments should be made per month, represented by Jiang Yiping. Recently, it was passed according to Jiang's and others' opinions. At the meeting on the 15th, Li Gongquan first spoke, advocating that more additions can be made, but not too early. Han Zhensheng expressed opposition to the government's subsidy policy, believing that subsidies only increase issuance and stimulate price increases. Zou Shuwen held the opposite view, believing that increasing issuance is enough to raise prices, but raising the prices of public utilities is even more enough to stimulate price increases. If public utilities increase prices once every ten days, it will accelerate the collapse of the entire economy. Zhang Zhijiang even believes that adjusting the prices of public utilities is just following the trend and will not help. The government should take measures to suppress prices at cost. Yang Buping also believes that increasing the prices of public utilities has too much impact on people's lives and advocates that prices cannot be increased. Jiang Yiping analyzed subsidies and price increases, saying that subsidies are borne by the people of the whole country, while price increases only affect a small number of people. It is better to change to adjusting twice a month. Qiao Hongshu, An Futing, Zhou Yongneng, and others all agreed with Jiang's opinion, and the chairman put it to a vote, which was passed by a majority.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] After the Legislative Yuan passed the amendment to the railway freight rate and fee adjustment method, the amount to be adjusted has been drafted by the Ministry of Communications. The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold an administrative meeting on the 16th to discuss it. Once it is passed, it will be implemented from the 17th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] After the Legislative Yuan passed the adjustment of postal, telecommunications, and railway freight rates and fees every half month, it is heard that the telecommunications department has decided to adjust it to five times. The telegram fee has increased from 200 yuan per word to 1,000 yuan, an increase of four times compared to before, which will be implemented after being passed by the administrative meeting on the 16th.</p>

<h3>Local Fighting Breaks Out Again in Jiangbei; Communist Army Continues to Invade Gaoqiao and is Repelled; Contact Also Made in Anqing, Pinghan Road is Peaceful</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The Jiangbei line, which had been silent for a while, has now started local fighting again. On the night of the 14th, Gaoqiao, the bridgehead on the opposite bank of Jiangdagang in Zhenjiang, continued to be invaded by more than 5,000 people from Chen Yi's Second Army. The defending army fought fiercely until 7:00 a.m. on the 15th with the help of the navy gunboats firing more than 2,000 rounds per hour to create a fierce fire net. After the national air force was also dispatched, the communist army finally collapsed and retreated to the north. The national army did not pursue it due to the peace talks. In addition, the communist army's Tenth Army in Anqing fired artillery shells at the national army positions such as the agricultural school in the eastern suburbs of the city again on the night of the 14th. After the national army counterattacked, it quickly subsided. There were no battles at the other Jiangbei bridgeheads on the 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 15th] There are no battles on the Zhenjiang front. The communist army outpost is at Zhujia Qigan, three miles north of Liuyu, but there is only one company. Every night, small groups of local bandits constantly harass the outside of the village, but there is no contact. Also, there are more than 500 communist troops at Dutian Temple, three miles east of Liuyu. According to military sources, after the main force of the communist army retreated to the north, they are now setting up a line of defense north of Shijiaqiao and have set up more than a dozen mountain guns, which seems to be preparing to attack us.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th] Military News: (1) The line from Pinghan Zheng to Xiaogan Huangpi is still defended by the national army, and there has been no new movement between the two sides in recent days. (2) Several thousand communist troops from Nie Rongzhen's department have recently been found to be active west of the railway in central Hubei, but their intentions are unclear. (3) The communist troops of Lin Biao, Chen Geng, and other departments east of the railway are maintaining their original positions, and the lines are becoming more and more silent. However, a part of the communist army between Huangmei and Guangji in eastern Hubei is moving southeast, seemingly to support Anqing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Huangpi, 15th] Military News: The Pinghan front is peaceful today, but the number of communist troops continues to increase in the Changxuanling area east of the road. In addition, the communist army gathered in Yunmeng territory west of the road has been identified as a division of Nie Rongzhen's department, and the two regiments of communist army in Yingshan County also belong to Nie's department. According to travelers from the north, the communist army headquarters is now in Xinyang, and there are as many as 1,000 transportation vehicles in the area. The communist army is very busy deploying troops in southern Henan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th] The General Headquarters announced: (1) At about 6:00 p.m. on the 14th, communist artillery fired ten shells at our Longshiqiao position north of the farm east of Anqing. The defending army suffered two casualties. After counterattacking, the shelling stopped. (2) At 2:00 a.m. on the night of the 14th, three or four hundred communist troops launched three consecutive attacks on the line of positions at Wulidun north of Anqing, but they were all repelled by the defending army. Another group of more than one hundred people also attacked Qingfengling (west of Longwang Temple) at the same time, but were also repelled.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] According to a certain authoritative military observer speaking to reporters, since Mao Zedong ordered the cessation of military operations on the 10th, it has been five days. During this period, although the communist army in some areas on the Jiangbei front has automatically withdrawn, and the entire line was once silent yesterday, in view of the fact that local battles broke out again in Jiangbei yesterday and a fierce offensive was launched against Taiyuan, the so-called order to "cease military operations" conveyed to the government representatives is actually a kind of "diplomatic rhetoric." The purpose of the local withdrawal is nothing more than to relax the national army's defenses, eliminate the national army's fighting spirit, and then carry out their deceitful techniques of wanting to capture and let go, to occupy the national army's positions and create a favorable situation. Now the national army has raised its vigilance and is on strict alert.</p>

<h3>Editorial: A Review of the Dispersal Policy</h3>
<p>In recent years, the activities of central banks in various countries in the open market have become increasingly active, which is sufficient to show the importance of modern central banks in controlling the market. Recently, the Central Bank of our country has also participated in open market activities—such as disposing of gold and silver, yarn, sugar, foreign exchange transfer certificates, etc.; but these activities are more for achieving its fiscal goals than for fulfilling its financial mission. Because it is passive, not active, it is the consumption of materials, not the use of materials, so the current dispersal policy, in addition to aggravating financial disturbances, is actually of no benefit to the policy itself.</p>
<p>On the 4th of this month, the materials disposed of by the Central Bank in the market, taking only gold as an example, exceeded 60,000 taels. This caused a sudden contraction of credit and an unprecedented chaotic phenomenon in the market. Although this measure was "a fatal blow to general speculators" (quoted from a speech by a person in charge of the Central Bank); but the price increases caused by this are obviously unstoppable. The Legislative Yuan has also paid close attention to this round of price increases. At the Yuan meeting on the 12th of this month, it raised enthusiastic questions to President Liu of the Central Bank. According to Liu's reply at the time, he believed that "the purpose of dispersing gold is to contract currency and suppress prices, and the gold is dispersed at market prices, so buyers cannot profit." No matter how pleasant this kind of official rhetoric sounds, our objective view of the dispersal policy cannot excuse the authorities' wrong decision-making.</p>
<p>Indeed, the gold dispersal policy expressed by Liu can contract currency and suppress prices; but in the current extraordinary situation, we believe that we must never follow theory and deny the real environment. Our current financial difficulties and the rampant floating capital have become a major event that everyone feels is shocking. At this time, if we talk about the dispersal policy, no matter how much gold, silver, yarn, sugar, and foreign exchange certificates, etc., I am afraid it will not be easy to achieve much effect, because the relationship between finance and the printing press cannot be separated, so despite disposing on one side, large amounts of funds are released on the other. As a result, the currency recovered always cannot offset the number of new banknotes released, so that between this incoming and outgoing, it has repeatedly become an opportunity for a few special people to make a fortune, and the interests of the country have been lost.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Central Bank's manipulation policy has always been nothing more than the consistent policy of "dispersing when high and supplementing when low." This is also a way for it to use the status of a super-large household, with this invincible posture, to control the market. But whether this hegemonic approach can stabilize the market and lower prices is doubtful. First, the rise and fall of various prices are now mostly related to financial commodities. Now that financial commodities are being hyped up by the Central Bank, prices are always booming, creating a general bullish psychology, making speculators even more unscrupulous and invincible. Second, the reason why open markets in various countries are successful is because their central banks have the power to control interest rates and control credit, and at the same time they are not constrained by currency inflation. Now that currency is maliciously inflated in our country, general funds are floating outside the financial circle, and of course none of the above conditions are met. How can the policy succeed? Based on these two points alone, it can be seen that the current dispersal policy does more harm than good.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the actual application of the dispersal policy, the Central Bank's dispersal policy is tantamount to encouraging people to speculate. Although the price of gold and banknotes can be suppressed at a certain time, the rise in prices will resume once the dispersal stops. The so-called heavier the suppression, the more violent the reaction, especially for the securities market where there are no stocks to disperse, it is like adding fuel to the fire. From the 4th of this month, Wing On Textile Factory rose from 18 yuan per share to 76.8 yuan as of yesterday, rising eight or nine limit-up in a row in twelve days; even when the Central Bank dispersed, gold and banknotes rose slightly, while stocks were the only ones that did well, still hitting the limit-up, which is not only an unprecedented rise in the securities market, but also an irony of the current dispersal policy. May I ask whether the financial authorities can also use "dispersal" to suppress the raging stock speculation market?</p>
<p>In addition, there is another point that is worth the attention of the authorities, that is, our country's wealth has long been exhausted due to the influence of the eight-year war of resistance and the four-year civil war. Where is there still the strength to disperse? According to the report of Supervisory Committee member Xiong Zaiwei et al. on the Central Bank's inventory, "the number of gold, silver, and other items dispersed from February 28th to the present is extremely large." Although Xiong et al. did not specify the amount dispersed, we are sure that it accounts for a considerable face value. It should be known that although the gold, silver, foreign exchange, materials, etc. that the Central Bank is constantly disposing of today have times when they are absorbed at low prices, they still inevitably fall into the hands of speculators in large quantities. Therefore, we suggest that the authorities should stop in time as soon as possible, and quickly take the gold and silver foreign exchange to foreign countries to exchange for daily necessities for people's livelihood, or machinery and raw materials needed for production, to replenish national strength. That is a wise measure. "It's not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost," and I hope the financial authorities will make a wise choice as soon as possible.</p>

He accused the government of lacking a consistent policy towards China and the Far East, and said that the policy of passively watching the civil war in China would result in 450 million Chinese people falling behind the Iron Curtain. Nolan's proposal to extend the aid to China program to February next year is that he said that the United States' lack of a policy towards China has harmed the Chinese government and helped the expansion of the communists.

<h3>United Nations General Assembly Resolves to Limit Use of Veto Power; Soviet Bloc Unanimously Votes Against; First Round of Atlantic Pact Verbal Sparring Concludes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 15th] The United Nations General Assembly voted yesterday by a vote of 43 to 6 to decide that the five permanent members of the Security Council should not use their veto power except on extremely important issues. The six countries of the Soviet bloc voted against, while India and Myanmar abstained. The resolution was proposed by China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. In addition to suggesting limitations on the use of the veto power, it also stipulates that the five permanent members should exchange opinions before the Security Council makes major decisions. China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France emphasized that the use of the veto power must be restricted to prevent its abuse from paralyzing the Security Council. The Soviet representative emphasized that the veto power is the cornerstone of the United Nations and should not be modified. He proposed convening a consultative meeting of the major powers of the Security Council to seek ways to improve the possibility of reaching unanimous resolutions among the major powers, but this was ultimately rejected by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] Soviet representative Gromyko issued a statement in the General Assembly last night in response to accusations by British representative McNeil and American representative Austin, and criticized Western countries as "hypocritical." The first round of verbal sparring over the North Atlantic Treaty has now concluded. Some representatives hope that this matter can be concluded at this session. Other representatives say that there is still one month left in the session, and the Soviet representative will definitely take the opportunity to launch further attacks.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 14th] British Chief Representative McNeil responded to Gromyko's attacks, saying that it was surprising that Gromyko, while discussing the veto power issue, brought up the issue of the Atlantic Pact with an attitude of barbaric aggression. After congratulating Gromyko on his appointment as the Soviet Union's first deputy foreign minister, McNeil said that Gromyko's colleagues, including himself, had originally expected that after Gromyko's promotion, he would adopt new procedures and methods, but unfortunately, although Gromyko's position was new, his methods remained the same. If the Soviet Union wishes to express its opinions on the Atlantic Pact, it should find a way to include it on the agenda of the General Assembly, and should not insert the Atlantic Pact while discussing other issues. Gromyko should know that the Atlantic Pact is purely defensive in nature, so only countries that are considering aggression can have reason to oppose the treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Flushing Meadow, 14th] American representative Austin, following McNeil, gave a speech stating that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko's accusation that the alliance of twelve countries was aimed at the Soviet Union "has no reasonable basis." He continued, "The treaty is the best way to guarantee peace. It is not an instrument of aggression, nor can it be used as an instrument of aggression, because this treaty is based on the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter."</p>
<h3>Kostov Dismissed Just Ten Days Ago; Bulgarian Premier Goes to Soviet Union for Treatment; Inside Story of Iron Curtain Arouses Speculation; Ambassadors to Yugoslavia from Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland Return to Posts</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] Bulgarian Premier Dimitrov resigned today from his positions as head of government and leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Western diplomats believe this is a sign of the collapse of the Soviet Union's Balkan empire.</p>
<p>Official sources in Sofia announced that Dimitrov had been granted "home leave" to receive medical treatment in the Soviet Union. This occurred only ten days after Dimitrov's right-hand man, Kostov, was removed from his positions as Deputy Premier and Chairman of the Economic and Financial Committee, and secret sources in Yugoslavia were rumored to have reported that the Bulgarian Communist Party had launched a full-scale purge.</p>
<p>The announcement of Dimitrov's "home leave" was jointly issued by the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers. The announcement did not elaborate on the term "home leave," but it is generally known that Dimitrov is ill. Dimitrov is 66 years old and also a Soviet citizen. At the same time, another announcement stated that Kostov had been appointed as the Director of the Bulgarian National Library.</p>
<p>The announcement of Dimitrov's departure has raised two questions among Balkan experts: (1) Will another Soviet satellite state spread its wings and fly away? (2) Has the struggle between Stalin and Tito for influence in the Balkans expanded? Official announcements, as usual, do not explain the details, but it is more noticeable than any event since Tito was expelled from the Cominform last year. Before Tito was expelled from the Cominform, he was quite friendly with Dimitrov, and they shared the same views on the future of the Balkans, both being major representatives of a Balkan or Eastern European Federation. The Soviet side has always opposed this federation plan. Dimitrov tried to restore this federation plan after the war, but it was ultimately not permitted by the Soviet Union. On January 17th of last year, he made another attempt, telling reporters in Rome that the establishment of an Eastern European Federation was still too early, but "the appropriate time will eventually come." The sudden announcement of Dimitrov's departure today clearly indicates preparations for Kolalov, who was trained in Moscow, to temporarily succeed him as acting premier. Kolalov is currently Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 15th] It is reported that the ambassadors to Yugoslavia from Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland have returned here after leaving Belgrade for a considerable period of time, but there is still no news of the Albanian ambassador returning to his post. In recent months, the embassies of various countries have been almost empty. According to Cominform sources, the Soviet ambassador will not be recalled, but may be replaced. The Czech ambassador already has a new position, but there are no signs of a new person being replaced in the near future. They said that the Hungarian ambassador has been out of office for two months.</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes in Bulgaria Surprise London; Yugoslavia Pays Close Attention</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 15th Broadcast: The sudden announcement by Bulgarian Communist Party veteran Dimitrov that he is "on leave" due to illness has greatly surprised Balkan experts here. This development is the most important since the split between the Kremlin and Tito. According to reports, in February of this year, the Communist Party-led "Bulgarian Fatherland Front" launched a purge of "anti-people elements." In March, Dimitrov's closest student, Kostov, was suddenly removed from his position as Deputy Premier, even though Dimitrov had long intended for Kostov to be his successor. The reason for Kostov's dismissal was his nationalistic tendencies, and his "crimes" were the same as Tito's. Now, Dimitrov himself is also reportedly going to the Soviet Union for treatment. Since Kostov's departure, Dimitrov has never mentioned Kostov's name in public. Therefore, it is speculated here that Bulgarian leaders may have criticized Dimitrov for failing to prevent Kostov's transformation beforehand. The most noteworthy thing at present is whether Bulgaria will form a new government and replace Dimitrov with a new person. However, this matter may be delayed, because Bulgarians have long regarded Dimitrov as the nation's mentor, and it seems inconvenient to replace him at this time.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 15th Broadcast: Belgrade News, since Bulgarian Communist leader Dimitrov left here for the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito has become the only "giant" in the Balkans. Yugoslavia expects that the Cominform will launch even more intense attacks against Tito and his supporters in the future.</p>
<h3>US Congress Completes Action on European Recovery Program Funding Bill</h3>

<h3>Prime Ministers of Australia, New Zealand, and Others Arrive in London Next Tuesday to Attend Commonwealth Conference; Status of India to Be Most Important Topic</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, Pakistani Prime Minister Ali Khan, and Ceylonese Prime Minister Senanayake will arrive in London on the same plane next Tuesday to attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. South African Prime Minister Malan departed from Cape Town today for England and is scheduled to arrive in London next Tuesday.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 14th] Highly reliable sources claimed on the 14th that India will remain in the British Commonwealth and recognize King George as the head of the Commonwealth. Indian Prime Minister Nehru will explain India's position when he attends the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London after Easter. London diplomatic circles say that India's status in the Commonwealth will be the most important topic discussed at the conference. British authorities say that if India remains in the Commonwealth, it must recognize the King, as he is the common bond between Commonwealth countries. Officials of Nehru's National Congress Party say that Prime Minister Nehru will emphasize that Indonesia is no longer a British dominion, but a "sovereign democratic republic," but is still willing to remain in the Commonwealth. These officials continued, "India will retain complete control over defense, foreign affairs, and internal affairs, and India will also demand assurances that Commonwealth member states have no military obligations." National Congress Party sources pointed out that British Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Welkgot, has taken the above formula to British Prime Minister Attlee. It is said that Attlee has stipulated that India must recognize the King.</p>
<h3>US Senator Nolan Urges Government to Arm South Korea and Condemns Wait-and-See Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Senator Nolan urged on the 14th that the plan to arm free nations be expanded to include South Korea. He told the Senate that South Korea "urgently needs" American arms to avoid being "ravaged" by communist troops. He said that South Korea faces the threat of 196,000 communist troops from North Korea. Nolan also warned against a "wait-and-see" policy toward the Chinese civil war. He said that this position will drive China's 450 million people behind the Iron Curtain. Nolan believes that Congress should consider taking similar action in the Far East before completing action on the Atlantic Pact and the arms export program to Europe.</p>

<h3>Door to Four-Power Negotiations on German Problem Not Closed</h3>
<p>Truman tells reporters</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 14th] President Truman said that the door to four-power negotiations on the German problem is still open, the question is whether the Soviet Union is willing to take advantage of it. This question was raised at today's press conference, when someone asked the president if he had heard any news of Soviet "probing" for a possible solution to the Berlin problem. Truman replied that this question had been adequately answered by Acheson on Wednesday.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] It was learned on the 15th that Dodge, the financial advisor to General MacArthur, and most members of his delegation plan to return to the United States at the end of this month.

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Allied General Headquarters Financial Advisor Dodge issued a 2,500-word statement on the 15th regarding the Japanese budget, criticizing the Japanese government and political parties for failing to prepare a balanced budget in the past. Dodge was apparently indirectly criticizing Yoshida's Liberal Party, which had firmly demanded that the Allied General Headquarters maintain its campaign promises to reduce taxes. This effort was the first requirement of the nine-point economic stabilization plan announced by MacArthur in December of last year due to Dodge's insistence and emphasis on creating and implementing a balanced budget.</p>
<h3>Plaster Statue Actually Sheds Tears</h3>
<p>New York Trash Can Side Drama Plays Out as a Miracle</p>
<p>[United Press, Syracuse, New York, 14th] An eleven-year-old girl named Anna here picked up a plaster statue of Saint Anne's head from a trash can last night and kissed its forehead. Hundreds of viewers said they had seen the statue's eyes repeatedly shedding tears. Others who kissed it had no reaction. Catholic priest Fufaro said he had witnessed this and found it incredible. Two other priests have also seen it. Anna is the eldest daughter of a milkman here, and the whole family is Catholic. She almost exhausted herself last night by performing this miracle for several hours. Saint Anne is the mother of the Virgin Mary. According to McMahon, Dean of the Pottery College of Alfred University in New York, speaking by telephone to reporters, it seems possible for the statue to shed tears from a scientific standpoint. Plaster easily absorbs water, but does not release it except through evaporation.</p>
<h3>Old Clam Produces Pearl</h3>

<h3>East Berlin Suggests Relaxing Blockade; Resuming Trade Between East and West; West Berlin Mayor Directly Rejects It</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 15th Broadcast: Berlin News, the Mayor of the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, Ebert, suggested on the 14th to relax the Soviet blockade so that factories in West Berlin could obtain raw materials from the Soviet-occupied zone, and its manufactured goods could also be transported to the Soviet zone. However, the Mayor of West Berlin, Reuter, has rejected this. Reuter also said that the Soviet blockade should be completely lifted immediately, and free elections should be held in the Soviet-occupied zone before trade between East and West Berlin can be restored. Berlin communist newspapers strongly criticized Reuter's attitude, and said that for the people of West Berlin, trade between East and West is urgently needed. Observers here say that the proposal to relax the Soviet blockade does not indicate that the Soviet side is willing to make peace, but is actually an attempt to increase production in East Berlin, because production in the Soviet-occupied zone has been greatly affected after Western countries refused to transport raw materials to East Germany.</p>

<h3>Cash for Salaries Flows into Banks; City Industrial Association Directors and Supervisors Negotiate with National Bank and Obtain Results; 70 Billion to Be Claimed and Distributed Directly; After Calculating Quotas for Each Industry, Cash to Be Collected in Total</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Although the Central Bank has agreed to provide half of the cash needed for factory payrolls in this city, with the National Bank supplying 90 billion yuan in cash on the 15th, 16th, and 18th, the National Bank's insistence on having the cash claimed by banks and firms resulted in yesterday's release of 20 billion yuan in cash, representing 30% of the National Bank's relaxation of cash withdrawals from deposits. Although the banks and firms claimed the cash, the factories did not receive it. Yesterday, prices soared, and workers demanded cash from the factories, which were unable to meet the demand.</p>
<p>The City Industrial Association convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors at 2 p.m. yesterday. As a result of the discussion, all directors and supervisors, led by Dong Yunzhang, Hong Nianzu, and Ouyang Lun, went to the Central Bank to petition. After waiting for more than an hour, Director Lin of the bank's Business Bureau came out to meet them.</p>
<p>According to Director Lin's report, in addition to issuing 20 billion yuan in cash to banks and firms today, 20 billion yuan in bank drafts were also issued. In addition, another 10 billion yuan in cash will be issued to state-owned enterprises. Since the 20 billion yuan in cash claimed by the banks and firms cannot reach the factories, it is hoped that the local authorities will find a way to guide the money industry, and that Director Cao of the City Social Affairs Bureau will take responsibility. As for the 70 billion yuan in cash to be issued today (16th) and on the 18th, because the banks and firms did not keep their promises, it was decided to deduct it all and allocate it to the Industrial Association. 30 billion yuan will be allocated on the 16th, and 40 billion yuan on the 18th. The method is to have the Industrial Association calculate the quotas for each industry, issue National Bank checks to the relevant banks and firms, and have the guilds endorse the checks before collecting the cash from the National Bank.</p>
<p>After the representatives of the City Industrial Association obtained this solution, Ouyang Lun, Hong Nianzu, Tian Heqing, Cai Tingtao, and Guo Yongxi calculated the amount of cash to be distributed to each industry according to the list of workers and wages reported by each industry guild overnight. On average, each worker can receive 155,276 yuan in cash. However, because the National Bank needs to be withdrawn in two days (30 billion yuan on the 16th, and 40 billion yuan on the 18th), only three-sevenths can be withdrawn on the 16th, and four-sevenths on the 18th. For the cash withdrawal procedure, each industry will issue National Bank checks to the banks and firms they deal with based on the Industrial Association's quota, and after the checks are endorsed by the industry guild, they will collect all the checks from the industry and withdraw the money from the National Bank. It is reported that the National Bank's payment office hours today will be extended until 5 p.m. The amount of cash to be allocated to each industry will be notified by the Industrial Association to each industry guild in a special letter this morning.</p>
<h3>Authorities Decide to Thoroughly Investigate and Prosecute Banks and Firms that Deduct Cash for Salaries</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] City Government Secretary-General Chen Liang expressed extreme anger that the huge amount of cash prepared by the National Bank for payrolls yesterday did not reach the hands of the workers. He believes that some banks and firms have deducted the cash after it was allocated, causing it to flow into the discount market, resulting in a serious situation of 20% discount, which is enough to disrupt finance and harm people's livelihood, and decided to investigate and prosecute thoroughly. Secretary-General Chen believes that the rise in the cost of living is the result of soaring prices, not the cause. Therefore, he said that the increase in various prices today due to the impact of the cost of living is very unreasonable. Some unscrupulous merchants deliberately raise prices to harm the citizens, and the authorities will implement reasonable control. The authorities will take decisive action against banks and firms in this city that deduct cash, and will arrest them when necessary and punish them under martial law.</p>

<p>The Jiang Defense Battle Intensifies: A Visit to the Anqing Front (Part 1) By Our Correspondent Liu Wei</p>
<p>[Anqing, This Newspaper, 12th] Anqing is a famous city on the Yangtze River and a stronghold. Under the combined operations of the national army's navy, army, and air force, it has been fighting bitterly for more than twenty days, but it still stands firmly on the banks of the great river, as stable as Mount Tai and unmoved.</p>
<p>Today, the soldiers of Guangxi are writing a glorious chapter in the Jiang Defense Battle by using "resolute defense" to shatter the communist army's belief in "inevitable victory" in Anqing. It is not only comparable to the famous Changsha Battle and the 47-day Defense of Hengyang during the Anti-Japanese War, but it is also a successful example of a three-dimensional war coordinated by the national army's navy, army, and air force.</p>
<p>With the assistance of Xu Qiming, Deputy Commander of the Eighth Pacification Zone, and Major General Huang Guannan, Colonel Li Xing, and Colonel Han Muxuan, the reporter spent three days traveling from Jiujiang to Anqing, the national army's bridgehead.</p>
<p>Difficult Road Conditions</p>
<p>This time, the reporter entered the famous city that has been fighting bitterly for more than ten days from Jiujiang. The journey of only 180 kilometers took three days, and I arrived outside the city at 6:00 PM on the 12th. As it was already curfew time when pedestrians were prohibited from entering the city, Colonel Bao Shiqi, the director of the political work department of the garrison, was consulted to send Clerk Chen out of the city to meet and guide me into the city. Under the bright moon, amidst the symphony of gunfire, wandering around the famous city on the riverbank and seeing the peaceful scenery inside the city, the fatigue of the journey suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>From Jiujiang to Anqing, the only safe transportation line now relies entirely on a hastily repaired highway. Because the communist army's intrusion into Huayang has blocked water transportation, except for naval vessels that can pass through the communist army's obstacles with artillery fire, other ships can only sail between Jiujiang and Pengze according to the Jiang defense regulations. However, except for military ships, in the vast Yangtze River east of Jiujiang, due to military reasons, one can only see rolling white waves but no shadows of sailboats.</p>
<p>The highway from Jiujiang to Anqing is 180 kilometers long. Because it was temporarily repaired, it is only a single-lane muddy road. The road surface is bumpy and uneven. In the event of rain, it is even more difficult to travel. Even highly skilled drivers regard it as a daunting task.</p>
<p>Visiting General Wu Zhongjian</p>
<p>After entering Anqing City, the first thing the reporter did was to visit General Wu Zhongjian, the commander of the garrison. The place where he lived was the core area of the fortifications. After passing through several layers of street and lane fortresses, piano music came from the curtains in a Western-style courtyard. It turned out that our Anqing garrison commander, General Wu, was playing the song "Seeking Peace in War."</p>
<p>General Wu gave the reporter the impression of being short and energetic. He did not have the air of an official or a crude manner towards an unfamiliar news reporter. He could analyze every matter or question with reason. Therefore, we talked about the KMT-CPC peace talks, the Anqing defense battle, and the recent world situation. He firmly believed that only by having one's own methods and strength can one achieve true peace. Taking the KMT-CPC peace talks as an example, if the Anqing bridgehead defense battle had taken a turn for the worse, then the communist party's so-called "peaceful cloak" would have long been removed to Jiangnan.</p>
<p>"Little Zhuge" Offensive</p>
<p>He was very satisfied with the success of this coordinated naval, land, and air operation and the assistance of the people of Anqing. At the same time, he was also satisfied with the communist party's Liu Bocheng's offensive, which enabled him to have a better opportunity to write a brilliant victory for the national army in the Anqing bridgehead defense battle with a small number of troops against the communist army, which was more than five times its size. He said: Liu Bocheng, the commander of the communist army in the "Battle of Anqing," is a famous general in the communist army, known as "One-Eyed Dragon" and "Little Zhuge." General Wu himself admitted that he was a short and as-yet-unnamed national army commander. If he could successfully defend Anqing and defeat Liu Bocheng in a desperate fight, then our short commander, Major General Wu Zhongjian, would also become famous.</p>
<p>Liu Bocheng gave a speech in Hefei to his troops attacking Anqing, saying: This time, you go and take over Anqing! He also said: If you can't fight a good victory, don't come back! Even the letter from Communist Army 11th Army Commander Du Yide to General Wu on the 6th and 7th of this month clearly stated that he was ordered to take over Anqing. Then, Anqing is still under the protection of the national army and is peaceful and auspicious today. The facts tell us who won the battle. Hangzhou! You should hold your head high!</p>
<p>Rejecting the Pity and Favor of the Rich By Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 13th] Although the mood of the people in paradise is unusually heavy, and the soaring prices are like a heavy lead that makes people breathless, there are still quite a few people coming to Hangzhou for spring outings. Although the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway did not add special spring outing trains like last year, it did add carriages after several trains. However, the grand scene is not as good as in previous years. The carriages added are no longer well-equipped first-class carriages, but only barely satisfactory second-class carriages. From this, we can see the economic situation of the people being carried. Top-class hotels such as Xileng, Dahua, and Xinxin are not always full, and the West Lake, Hubin, and Huanhu on the shore of West Lake are not necessarily crowded. Only some third- and fourth-class hotels are very lively. The teahouses are also the same. Louwailou and Taiheyuan are not like in previous years, where people queue up to eat. Although there are also sedans and punts in front of the door, they are not congested on the roads of the Outer West Lake.</p>
<p>In the famous scenic spots, few people sit down to drink tea, they just stroll around.</p>
<p>Yuan Datou Rampant</p>
<p>People from the Beijing-Shanghai area are mostly middle- and lower-level merchants with a sense of adventure. Although they still miss Hangzhou and still come to Hangzhou to play, they must calculate their travel expenses. An average person who comes to Hangzhou for a trip needs at least one Yuan Datou per day for a hotel, one Yuan Datou per meal, two Yuan Datou for rickshaw fare, and five Yuan Datou per day for hiring a punt. In total, it costs six or seven Yuan Datou per day. Civil servants, people in the cultural field, and people in the education field simply do not have the ability to come to Hangzhou. Even middle- and lower-level merchants have to think twice. No wonder they have become a stingy bunch.</p>
<p>A Pleasing Sound</p>
<p>Speaking of Yuan Datou, it has reached its extreme in Hangzhou. The government originally designated three places, namely Chengzhan, Shuiyangqiao, and Zhong'anqiao, as silver dollar markets, but Shuiyangqiao has expanded to the entire Qingtai Street. Qingtai Street is a major transportation route, and it is crowded every day. Chengzhan is also like this, and Zhong'anqiao is also like this. Now, silver dollar trading has almost developed on every street: Yanling Road, Yingshi Road, and Hubin Road all have the sound of clanging silver dollars, a pleasing sound to the ear. The police have intervened at one time, but they could not intervene well, so they had to let the silver dollar trading go. Recently, in food shops, there are also people trading silver dollars. Famous scenic spots such as Lingyin, Yue Tomb, and even Jiuxi Eighteen Ravines all have vendors trading silver dollars. Many tourists who come for spring outings bring silver dollars and exchange them with these vendors because they feel that the gold yuan is worthless and the silver dollar is valuable. Therefore, after exchanging for gold yuan, they naturally save money and use it sparingly to avoid exchanging too many silver dollars. This is certainly a psychological factor for the weak spring season this year.</p>
<p>Relying on the Spring Season</p>
<p>This year's spring season is obviously not as good as in previous years. Many people who rely on the spring season to live for a year are complaining and disappointed. They complain about the unrest in the current situation. Otherwise, wealthy merchants would definitely come together, and they could breathe a little easier. But Hangzhou has its own value. Hangzhou cannot always be a consumer city for people to appreciate. It should stand up, hold its head high, and reject all the pity and favor of the rich. It should make people who come here take back incomparable "spiritual food." It should make people feel that Hangzhou is an indispensable place for cultivation.</p>
<p>Hangzhou! Although you have a beautiful appearance, you must have rich content, or you may avoid falling into the tragic situation of being appreciated when people are happy and abandoned when they are unhappy.</p>

<p>Money Supply Eases, Prices Rise Across the Board: Rice Prices Soar Madly; White粳 and Thin Rice Spot Prices Exceed 600,000 Mark</p>
<p>The rice market has skyrocketed due to the easing of money supply and rising gold and commodity prices, causing extreme bullish sentiment. At the opening, white粳 and early rice opened at 530,000 to 550,000, but the market was extremely tight. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately ordered that transactions be limited to 550,000, advising against exceeding it, but prices continued to rise. White粳 and thin rice were bid at 600,000, and early rice at 580,000, all for spot payments, representing a nearly 50% surge compared to the previous day. Today, banker's draft prices for white粳 and thin rice are 660,000, and early rice is 640,000. Total arrivals in the two markets were 2,426 shi.</p>
<p>Edible Oil Prices Soar Madly</p>
<p>Edible oil prices have risen rapidly due to the easing of money supply and rising commodity prices. Edible oil is in short supply, and prices have risen even more sharply. Rapeseed oil rose from 2.9 million to close at 3.25 million, and soybean oil closed at 3.9 million, each soaring by more than 50%. Crude oil was at 3.85 million, and no one sold it in the after-market. All other commodities rose by 50%. Soybean cake reached the 200,000 mark, and "Li Zi" cake was at 210,000.</p>
<p>Flour Market</p>
<p>Flour market prices fluctuated violently. Transactions were delayed because the Social Affairs Bureau ordered strict prohibition of price gouging, and people were wary and dared not trade openly. However, an undercurrent of activity was surging. "Bing Chuan" flour reached a high of 270,000 but was difficult to buy. Towards the close, it was reported that the Central Bank was dumping again, and gold prices plummeted. Market prices then collapsed, falling from 260,000 to 246,000. Retail investors slightly absorbed the low price, and the last transaction returned to 250,000. "Lao Che" flour closed at 266,000. Wheat bran remained untraded at the opening.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>All-around Surge: Soybean prices surged by more than 50%, with winter beans reaching as high as 650,000. Raw peanuts rose by more than 40%, with Yangzhou raw peanuts reaching a peak of 1.5 million. Sesame prices surpassed 100,000, and sellers were holding firm, resulting in very few transactions. Corn rose by 45%, and red sorghum and mung beans continued to soar.</p>
<p>Gold Market Activity Outside the Exchange: National Bank Dumps Heavily to Suppress Prices</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market was extraordinarily bullish due to the influence of the Hong Kong gold rush. Amidst the competition among buyers, the market opened in the morning at 4.5 million and rose all the way to the 5.04 million upper limit, with demand exceeding supply, resulting in a standstill. In the afternoon, buying and selling were cautious, and activity was sparse. Transactions remained in a holding pattern, rising another 840,000 from the previous day.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the off-exchange spot market opened at 5.8 million and 6.3 million. Midday buying activity was strong, pushing prices up to 6.5 million and 6.8 million. Around 10:00 AM, the Central Bank commissioned Dadecheng and Zhaofengchang Gold Shops to aggressively sell off gold. The initial price was 6.1 million, gradually dropping to 5.8 million. Near noon, it was further reduced to 5.5 million, with a total of over 580 large bars sold. Market sentiment softened slightly, and prices briefly rebounded to 5.6 million and 5.9 million. The noon close was 5.8 million and 6.1 million.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, overnight transactions opened at 6.6 million and 6.8 million. Due to favorable external factors, the market was bullish, and prices once broke through the 7 million mark, reaching as high as 7.1 million and 7.4 million. The Central Bank commissioned Dadecheng and Zhaofengchang to continue dumping large quantities of gold through dual channels, reducing the price of overnight positions from 7.3 million and 6.9 million all the way to 6.5 million, with another 200 large bars sold. The upward trend was slightly curbed, and leveraged buyers sold off positions, causing prices to fall to 6.5 million and 6.7 million at the close.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, off-exchange futures transactions opened in the morning at 6.5 million and 6.8 million, reaching highs of 7.5 million and 7.8 million, and lows of 6.1 million and 6.4 million. The noon close was 7 million and 7.3 million. In the afternoon, there was some profit-taking on high prices. The opening price was low at 6.8 million and 7.1 million, reaching highs of 7.1 million and 7.4 million. Towards the close, influenced by the Central Bank's gold dumping, prices gradually decreased to 6.2 million and 6.5 million, closing at 6.3 million and 6.6 million. Overnight interest on long and short positions remained open at 155 yuan and 165 yuan, with an additional interest of 1.3 million per tael, pushing prices to 7.6 million and 7.9 million. The final price was settled at 8 million.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, gold jewelry prices changed twice. In the morning, they were listed at 5.6 million and 6.2 million, and in the afternoon, they rose to 6 million and 6.7 million, an increase of 6 million from the previous day. Silver jewelry also rose by 5,000, increasing to 50,000 and 70,000. According to Mr. Wu Pengnian, due to a lack of cash, most of the retail transactions in recent days have been conducted with checks. Moreover, the volatile gold prices have made business quite difficult. Therefore, the buying and selling prices yesterday were extended to 700,000.</p>
<p>US Dollar</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the off-exchange US dollar market was tight due to a scarcity of chips, and large transactions were in demand with no supply, resulting in a firm footing. The market opened in the morning at 120,000 and 130,000, reaching highs of 135,000 and 140,000, and lows of 115,000 and 120,000. The noon close was 130,000 and 135,000. In the afternoon, transactions opened at 140,000 and 145,000, reaching highs of 145,000 and 150,000, and closing at 138,000 and 143,000. Spot transactions were relatively thin, with a bid of 120,000 and 125,000, an increase of 10,000 from the previous day.</p>
<p>One Ounce of Gold Equivalent to Fifty "Tai Tou" Silver Dollars</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The exchange rate between the Central Bank's gold and Yuan Datou silver dollars was announced late at noon. One ounce of gold was equivalent to 50 Yuan Datou silver dollars, an increase of two yuan from the previous day. However, because the announcement time was too late, most factories could not directly exchange with the National Bank and still had to go through the hands of various firms. Therefore, the number of silver dollars exchanged yesterday was not large.</p>
<p>Silver Dollars Soar</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage was sluggish because Shanghai prices were turbulent, and participants were uneasy. There were slightly more transactions in North China, and exchange rates went straight up. Transactions in other areas, such as South China and West China, were quiet, with a total of about 150,000 exchanged.</p>
<p>Street Transactions Rise and Fall Suddenly</p>
<p>Street transactions rose and fell suddenly and were volatile. In the middle of the month, due to the payment of salaries, the liquidation of various retail investors was active. Moreover, with gold prices soaring again, market sentiment was strong. "Da Tou" (Big Head) silver dollars initially traded at 100,000 and 110,000, once rising to 125,000 and 135,000 near noon. In the afternoon, due to the high prices, some inventory was cleared, dropping to 110,000 and 120,000. In the evening, they rose again to 120,000 and 130,000. "Xiao Tou" (Small Head) silver dollars were bid at 95,000 and 100,500. "Long Ying Yang" silver dollars were bid at 70,000 and 75,000. Banker's draft transactions once reached highs of 135,000 and 145,000, falling slightly to 130,000 and 140,000 in the afternoon, an increase of 25,000 across the board compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>50,000 and 100,000 Denomination Notes Not Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>Suspended Due to Unfavorable Reactions From All Sides</p>
<p>The "50,000 yuan" and "100,000 yuan" denomination notes were originally scheduled to be released yesterday. However, the Central Bank decided to suspend them again due to unfavorable reactions from all sides, fearing that they would further stimulate prices when the cost of living index was announced. However, in order to solve the cash shortage, the 50,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan denomination notes will definitely be issued in the near future. (China Economic News Agency)</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, the city's money supply was initially loose in the morning, with daily interest rates of about 90 yuan to 100 yuan. Subsequently, due to soaring prices, there was strong demand for capital from all sides. Near noon, the National Bank sold more than 10,000 taels of gold, and money supply tightened slightly, with daily interest rates also rising to 150 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, due to the release of large amounts of cash, the banks also issued a large net outflow of 39.1 billion yuan. The money supply eased, and daily interest rates gradually rose to 70-80 yuan. Yesterday, the total input of various banks in the large exchange was 27.7 billion yuan, the net outflow of foreign firms was 2.9 billion yuan, and the net input of the small exchange was 14.3 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Exchange Certificates Rise: Up 44,000 from Previous Close</p>
<p>The exchange certificate market price rose sharply yesterday. The buying price at the opening in the morning was 70,000 yuan, rising to 88,000 yuan. Certificate holders were still unwilling to sell, and no transactions were made. It was not until nearly 11:00 that some transactions were made at 90,000 yuan. Subsequently, the highest price rose directly to 95,000 yuan, and the closing price decreased slightly to 91,000 yuan. The number of transactions yesterday was extremely small. Customers were watching due to the excessively high bid prices. The National Bank only dumped 100,000 yuan yesterday. It is reported that British HSBC Bank made more purchases. The market price rose sharply by 36,000 yuan compared to the previous noon close.</p>
<p>Tea Market Transactions Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market saw weak transactions because money supply among the industry remained tight. In addition, salaries were about to be issued to employees after the index was announced. Buying activity suddenly decreased, and transactions declined again. However, the trend remained firmly in a quiet manner, and prices rose in a roundabout way. Because the prices of various goods outside the industry were soaring, sellers were reluctant to sell due to the steep increase in costs. The process moved forward repeatedly, but most of it was just empty bidding.</p>
<p>Coal Prices Adjusted</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Four Mines Joint Venture adjusted coal prices yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>Coal: 799,900 yuan, "Kai" Coal: 1,398,300 yuan, Foreign Coal: 1,779,100 yuan.</p>
<p>Cigarettes and Soap Soar</p>
<p>Cigarettes and soap rose across the board. The rise in prices in the previous market was driven by gold and foreign exchange. The sharp increase in the cost of living index made people bullish, and buying activity from all sides became stronger.</p>
<p>White "*" packs immediately broke through the 70,000 mark, soaring by 14,000 yuan. 20-piece "Da Ying" packs were at 27,800 yuan, also soaring by 7,000 yuan. Subsequently, the market gradually rose, and listed prices in the market increased by 3,000-5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The price increase of soap became even more severe. "Gu Ben" soap was above 900,000 yuan, at 930,000 yuan, a surge of 230,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands also rose sharply. "Mei Li" matches broke through the 3 million mark, at 3.8 million yuan, a surge of 1 million yuan. The rest also rose sharply by 500,000 to 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Downstream Copper and Tin</p>
<p>Copper and tin market prices have long been shifting with the rise in gold and foreign exchange. Although the opening prices have recently been increasing, they have only been adding interest. The price chasing has been weak compared to gold and foreign exchange. As a result, local products, such as pure tin, native lead, and "Zi" lead, have become difficult to sell and have been declining. For example, pure tin once reached a high of 34 taels of gold per "*" (unit), native lead was 5.5 taels of gold, and "Zi" lead was 4.5 taels of gold as the pricing standard. Now, they have all fallen to 32 taels for pure tin, 4 taels for native lead, and 3 taels for "Zi" lead. The prices of imported goods are still related to foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Sharply: Cloth Market Buying Activity Surges</p>
<p>Yesterday, cotton yarn prices began to rise sharply. The tight money supply has eased, and with all goods outside the industry soaring, people are alarmed. All parties are holding onto their goods, and buyers have increased even more. Buying activity has surged, and sellers have taken the opportunity to raise prices, with all yarns rising by 50% to 60%.</p>
<p>42-count "Lan Feng" yarn initially broke through the 40 million yuan mark, reaching a new high. It then surged to 43 million yuan, closing at 42 million yuan, a sharp increase of 16 million yuan from before the suspension. 32-count "Yin Yue" yarn rose by 15 million yuan, closing at 28.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>32-count spot "Shuang Ma" yarn opened at 20 million yuan and reached a high of 24 million yuan, finally closing at 23.5 million yuan, a sharp increase of 10.4 million yuan. 20-count "Shuang Ma" yarn went straight to the 20 million mark from 19 million yuan. Finally, under favorable conditions, it broke through the mark and created a peak of 21.5 million yuan, a surge of 9.2 million yuan compared to before. The rise in prices for other yarns was unprecedented, with new highs frequently seen.</p>
<p>The rise in cloth prices was in full swing. Because the trend in money supply has eased and the authorities have admitted that 50,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan notes will be issued, people's hearts have been greatly encouraged. Buying activity in the market has surged, and holders of goods are unanimously bullish. Yesterday, the market fell into a frenzy, and prices jumped wildly.</p>
<p>At the initial opening in the morning, first-grade fine cloth was at 620,000 yuan, and "Si Jun Zi" serge was at 590,000 yuan. After opening, buyers actively sought goods, and sellers insisted on not selling. Buyers voluntarily increased their bids to absorb goods, with the former reaching a maximum of 790,000 yuan and the latter 760,000 yuan. Near noon, due to the excessive surge, people were wary of heights, and retail investors sold off some holdings, causing prices to show signs of fatigue. Finally, they rose again. The noon close was 700,000 yuan for first-grade fine cloth and 670,000 yuan for serge, a sharp increase of 60% each. After the close, prices increased by another 50</p>

<h3>Tongcheng Vessel Returns to Shanghai from Qingdao, Runs Aground Near Sheshan but Averted Danger. Boat Transporting Food Supplies Lost in Wind, Fourteen Employees Rescued and Arrived in Shanghai, One Salvage Worker Tragically Drowned.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Tongcheng Company's Tongcheng vessel returned to Shanghai from Qingdao last Saturday. The next day, it ran aground in the sea off Sheshan, seven nautical miles southwest of the island, due to dense fog and disorientation. The company immediately sent a telegram for help. On the 11th, the company requested the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send the Ji'an vessel towing the iron barge No. 303. Twenty temporary salvage workers led by Captain Fan Lun left port on the morning of the 12th to rush to the scene of the accident to attempt rescue. However, because the water was shallow, the Ji'an vessel could not get close and had to anchor in deep water one nautical mile away. After Captain Fan Lun's study, it was necessary to dispatch a landing craft to assist, so he immediately telegraphed the headquarters. On the morning of the 14th, the landing craft No. 208 was dispatched to assist in the rescue. However, at this time, the Tongcheng vessel was running out of food supplies. On the evening of the 13th, a sampan carrying 14 employees was launched to transport food supplies from the Ji'an vessel. Unexpectedly, the weather suddenly changed, and the wind and waves rose suddenly. The sampan was small and could not be controlled, causing it to drift with the waves and disappear. The Ji'an vessel received the news and quickly weighed anchor and cruised around the area in search, but by the next morning, there was no trace. Fortunately, the landing craft No. 103, returning to Shanghai from Xiamen, spotted them near Litongsha and rescued all 14 people on the sampan and brought them to Shanghai. They arrived safely at the Qiujiang Wharf on the 14th. The Tongcheng vessel was also towed out of danger by No. 208 at 1:00 PM yesterday, and is now being towed back to Shanghai by the craft and is expected to enter the port this morning. The Ji'an vessel and the 303 iron barge completed their mission and returned to Shanghai yesterday. One of the twenty temporary salvage workers on the 303 iron barge, Yan Changgen, was hit by a wire cable and fell into the sea at 10:50 PM on the 13th while stowing the cable due to the high winds and waves. He could not be rescued in time and sank to the bottom of the sea. It is said that the deceased, Yan Changgen, was a local, 26 years old, and had elderly parents and was the only son of three families. His situation is very tragic. Yesterday afternoon, at around 4:00 PM, the family members went to the maritime department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting to forward their request to the Tongcheng Company for compensation, but there has been no result yet.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Apprentice Sentenced to Detention for Reducing Household Rice Rations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Zhurong, an apprentice at the Tianxing Rice Shop in this city, was instigated by the shop owner, Cao Tianyi, to tamper with the scales used for weighing rice to reduce the amount of rice allocated to households. On the 16th of last month, residents of the district, Pan Jinshan, Ying Mingyou, Wu Peiyuan, and others, went to the shop with ration purchase certificates to buy household rice. Chen weighed and delivered the rice, and each was shorted several catties of rice. After the police station in charge found out, the shop owner, Cao Tianyi, fled without a trace. Chen was arrested and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday, the District Court pronounced its verdict: Chen Zhurong was sentenced to twelve days of detention and fined three million yuan for continuously obtaining illegal benefits in property through fraudulent means. If he chooses to perform labor instead of paying the fine, the amount of the fine will be converted into the number of days of labor at a ratio of the total amount of the fine to six months.</p>
<h3>Chaotic Rice Price Bidding, Social Bureau Inquires and Corrects, Instructs Rice Industry Leaders on Two Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of rice in the market reached 550,000 yuan per picul due to the increase in prices in the production areas and the rise in gold and silver yuan. However, the supply was scarce, and all transactions were moved off-site. The retail prices were very chaotic, generally above 700,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Cao, the head of the Social Bureau, specially summoned the managers of the north and south markets and the responsible persons of the Rice Business Association to inquire about the rice price increases. Mr. Cao also gave two instructions: (1) The Social Bureau has received reports that the rice market is exchanging one tael of gold for eight piculs and five pecks of rice, which is extremely illegal. If this continues, small rice shops will not be able to operate. He sternly reprimanded the market managers and ordered them to pay attention to cracking down on this. (2) The retail prices lack any standard and should also be corrected. The retail prices of each rice shop should be restrained.</p>
<h3>Rationed Rice Shops to Hang Signs, Civil Survey Office Standardizes Style</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to facilitate citizens' purchase of household rice, the Civil Survey Office has stipulated that each rationed rice shop must hang a sign indicating the amount and price of rationed rice. Each rice shop has already made its own temporary signs, but they vary in size and are not conspicuous. Now, the office has notified each rice shop to pay a fee, and the supervisory districts will uniformly manufacture the signs from wood and distribute them to each rationed rice shop to hang up to facilitate citizens' purchase. In addition, in order to promote the rationing policy and answer citizens' inquiries, the Civil Survey Office has agreed with Shanghai Radio to hold a "People's Food Lecture" on the radio every Saturday afternoon at 8:00 PM.

<h3>Water Police Bureau Patrol Officer Under Investigation for Demanding Rice from Shipping Companies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Ruren, a patrol officer of the Water Police Bureau from Zhuji, 29 years old, joined the force on January 20th of this year. His duty was to patrol and guide ships traveling to and from the Suzhou Creek. Soon after taking office, Wang ordered his subordinates to "spread the word" to various shipping companies, saying that each company should "show respect" to him with two piculs of white rice. Otherwise, if any ships travel to and from the Suzhou Creek, he would make things difficult for them. Three or four days before the Lunar New Year, Wang invited personnel from Lichuan, Jiangxing, Dada, and other companies to meet at the Bund Park to discuss the matter. At that time, each company was only willing to offer seven pecks of rice as a year-end bonus, so the meeting ended unhappily. Later, several companies paid two piculs of rice to show their accommodation, while others ignored him. He then deliberately created difficulties for them, which led to disputes and police reports. The District Prosecutor's Office investigated and prosecuted him for corruption by abusing his authority. The trial opened yesterday in the District Court, and all shipping companies sent representatives to testify in court. After the court reviewed the evidence, it ordered that the suspect be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

He was in a hurry to catch the train and did not have time to explain to the hospital. He did not intend to steal the item, and he requested that the court find him innocent.
