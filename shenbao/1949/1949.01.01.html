<h3>總統發表元旦日文告　和戰關鍵繫於共黨　憲法不能違反國家必須獨立完整　軍隊應有保障人民維持生活自由</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕蔣總統頃發表卅八年元旦文告，全文如下：</p>
<p>全國同胞：今天是中華民國卅八年開國紀念日，自國父倡導國民革命，創造中華民國，開國至今，整整經過了卅七年，在這一長期間之中，革命先烈，愛國軍民流血犧牲，堅貞奮鬥，飽經挫折，備歷艱辛，憲法纔得實施，憲政纔告成立，我們今日在憲政政府成立之後，第一次舉行開國紀念，深覺歲月蹉跎，建國事業如此遲滯，三民主義未能實現，實在是感愧萬分。溯自抗戰結束之後，政府唯一的方針在和平建設，而政府首要的任務，在收復淪陷了十四年的東北，以期保持我國家領土，主權的完整。但是，三年以來，和平建國的方針遭逢了阻撓，東北接收的工作也竟告失敗，旦在去年一年之中，自濟南失守以後，錦州·長春·瀋陽相繼淪陷，東北九省重演九一八的悲劇。華東·華北工商事業集中的區域，學術文化薈萃的都市，今日皆受匪患的威脅，政府衛國救民的志職，未能達成，而國家民族的危機，更加嚴重，這是中正個人領導無方，措施失當，有負國民付託之重，實不勝其慚惶悚慄，首先應當引咎自責的。</p>
<p>今日戡亂軍事已進入了嚴重的階段，國家的存亡，民族的盛衰，歷史文化的絕績，都要決定於這一階段之中，而我同胞每一個人，每一家族的自由或奴役，生死或存亡。也要在這一階段之中來決定了。怎樣纔能渡過這一難關，克服這一危機，成爲我同胞每一個人異常關懷的問題，而大家對於政府當前的決策，都感覺其利害關係之重大，因爲剿匪軍事加重了人民的負担，加深了人民的痛苦，百萬富翁也都希望戰事及早結束，和平及早實現，所以和戰問題，盤旋於每一同胞的心胸之間，而政府爲戰爲和，亦更爲每一同胞所關注。中正受全民的付託，負國家的重責，對於當前的局勢，自應有詳切的檢討，而對於人民的希望，更不能不作深長的考慮。</p>
<p>只望和平果能實現　個人進退絕不縈懷</p>
<p>國父說：「中華民國之建國，其目的在和平。」中正爲三民主義的信徒，秉承國父的遺教，本不願在對日作戰之後，再繼之以剿匪的軍事，來加重人民的痛苦。所以抗日戰事甫告結束，我們政府立即揭舉和平建國的方針，更進而以政治商談，軍事調處的方法，解決共黨問題。不意經過了一年有半的時間，共黨對於一切協議和方案，都橫加梗阻，使其不能依預期的步驟，見諸實施。而最後更發動其全面武裝叛亂，危害國家的生存。我政府迫不得已，乃忍痛動員，從事戡亂，這是最近的歷史事實，在世人心目中，記憶猶新。共產主義在中國的發展，已歷二十五年，而中正在此二十五年之中，無時不期待共黨以國家民族爲前提，復政黨政治的常軌，共謀和平相處之道，以樹立民主的弘規。三年以來，政治商談之目的，固在於和平，卽動員戡亂之目的，亦在於和平。但是今日時局爲和爲戰，人民爲禍爲福，其關鍵不在於政府，亦非我同胞對政府片面的希望所能達成。須知這個問題的決定，全在於共黨。國家能否轉危爲安，人民能否轉禍爲福，乃在於共黨一轉念之間。所以我們同胞要解決這個問題，先要問明共黨，其對和平的意響究竟如何，只要共黨一有和平的誠意，能作確切的表示，政府必開誠相見，願與商討停止戰事，恢復和平的具體方法。只要和議無害於國家的獨立完整，而有助於人民的休養生息。只要神聖的憲法不由我而違反，民主憲政不因此而破壞，中華民國的國體能夠確保。中華民國的法統不致中斷，軍隊有確實的保障，人民能夠維持其自由的生活方式與目前最低生活水準，則我個人更無復他求。中正畢生革命，早置生死於度外，只望和平果能實現，則個人的進退出處絕不縈懷，而一惟國民的公意是從，如果共黨始終堅持武裝叛亂到底，並無和平誠意，則政府亦惟有盡其衛國救民的職責，自不能不與共黨周旋到底，尤其是京·滬地區，爲政治中樞所在，更不能不全力保衛，實行決戰。我深信政府不僅在此有決勝的把握，而且整個國家轉危爲安和全體人民轉禍爲福的樞機，亦在於此，我同胞須知，今日惟有軍民一致，堅持此自衛戰爭，而在決戰之中獲利勝利，纔能爭取真正的和平，更惟有忍受一時的痛苦犧牲，絻能免鐵幕重重，暗無天日的地獄生活。中正個人自參加革命戰爭以來，迄今幾四十年，我在每一長期戰役之中，都是備歷艱辛，飽經挫折，受盡誣蔑，無論失敗到什麼程度，我始終持有必勝的信念，而最後也必能達到成功的境域。要知道我們所倚恃者爲民族精神，人類正義與世界公理，共黨匪軍的暴力，能劫取我東北，却不能征服我們的民族精神，能侵入我們的腹地，不　　能侮辱我民族的人格。正義就是決勝的力量，公理終必勝過暴力，我們這一代遭逢了中國五千年歷史空前未有的變局，也就要担負着五千年歷史空前未有的使命，我們只有忍受一時的痛苦與犧牲，爲國家民族的生存歷史文化的延續，生活方式的自由和後世子孫的滋長而奮鬥。</p>
<p>同胞們當此歲序更新之際，緬懷國父及先烈締造民國的艱難，體念前綫軍民堅貞奮鬥的痛苦，更覺中正個人責任重大與職務艱鉅，亦深信我愛國同胞決不能忍受共黨的清算，亦不能坐視國家的危亡，只有軍民一體，舉國一致，團結奮鬥，保障我們民主自由的生活，竭盡衛國保種的天職，收獲八年抗戰所得的成果，以告慰我無數軍民先烈在天之靈，國父說「最後成功歸於最後努力者」，願與我全國同胞共勉之。（完）</p>

<h3>徐永昌元旦廣播　勉軍人完成戡亂</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕國防部徐部長，定元旦假軍中廣播電台，向全國陸海空軍官兵，曁在鄉軍人廣播原詞，略稱：目前國家，正陷入危疑震撼的境地，各位同志無論在前方後方，一樣都忍受着困苦和艱難，所以永昌旣痛感我們軍人責任的重大，同時對於各位同志堅毅卓絕的精神，格外關念，雖然戰綫遼闊，交通梗阻，使我們不能一一親自慰問，但是我相信全軍上下，以及我十九萬餘退役退伍的官兵，對於挽救國家的危機，都具有同樣的熱忱，對於國家和國軍的前途，都具有同樣的信念。換言之，永昌和散布在全國各地的袍澤們，在精神上是聯繫的，是一致的，希望都能本着這種最可珍貴的聯繫性，和一致性，精誠團結，努力奮發，達成我們各個人所應盡的任務。</p>
<p>現在我們主要的任務，自然是在戡亂，談到戡亂的成功，自以軍事爲第一，所以我們當前最急要的問題，就是前方的勝利，因此我們現在全體官兵，每個人都身繫國家安危，大家應該在最高統帥領導之下，以成仁取義的決心，來實現戡亂建國的使命。</p>

<h3>三十八年元旦獻辭</h3>
<p>一月一日者，歲序遷嬗之見端，民國肇建之元辰也。年年此日，例有慶集。經雙重意義之鞭策，據幾許感喟與惆悵，輒覺逝晷莫攀，來景可追，而一綫萌動之生機，遂伴淸新之時日以俱臨矣。三十七年歲暮期間，正值低氣壓籠罩全滬；晦霧與愁霖交　，災厄狹殃咎相乘。使人人心頭咸有沉重之感覺，即人人行止咸有旁皇之表現。此沉重，此旁皇，當為一般共有之體騐，而非個人神態之失常。茲當三十八年之精爽式憑，吾人亦欲一祓巳往之不祥。椒花歌頌之作，非所樂承；捭闔縱橫之談，亦姑從免。此時此日，卑無高論，且就小民之觀點，一申戔微之願望：</p>
<p>自日寇肆虐，逋毒遍地，我國經八年神聖之抗戰，亦幾於形憔而神瘁。勝利乍臨，薄海騰歡。肝腦塗地之烈士，雖孤魂溘盡，徼倖得無上之代價。而刦餘殘燼之幸草，亦欣欣有向榮之新機。何意寗宇不久，亂離重逢。砲火之洗禮一起，村落之庭舍為壚。戰事直接所蒙損失，為無限軀命之浪擲，大量流民之蕩柝。間接影響所及，則製成經濟情形之激盪，，般生活之顛連·人民窒息於愁雲慘霧之下者，殆無日不懷剝極而復之望。甚願三十八年以後，烽烟永戢，家戶又安。化戾氣為祥和，登斯民於衽席·俾億萬人咸得致力於產殖之增進，以共謀國族之復與·吾人所馨香禱祝者，此其一。</p>
<p>世界自經二次大戰以後，慘痛酷烈之教訓，固巳深　於人心。今試執歐美人士而詢以戰爭之需要，殆無不示其堅決之反響。然而蘇美間對立之形勢，正隱示未來杌楻之醞釀。柏林泠戰之步調，方且愈演而愈烈。玩火於積薪之側，習泅於不測之淵，焚身滅頂之凶，隨在可以召致。覆轍猶存，來軫罔戒，此中危機，寗待深論？實則美蘇之間，壞地並不毗接，過去，共患難；縱主義出入，懷抱互歧，亦儘可經其他諧弭之術，豈必以戰爭為解決之途？雙方誠能體念黎民，各自反省，，循開誠布公之徑，絕爾詐我虞之念，即不難使現狀煥然改觀，大局轉趨穩定。然後集合各國技術人才，加强原子能之運用，為醫學界創造奇偉之殊績，為人類史特闢燦爛之一葉。吾人所殷切企求者，此其二。</p>
<p>今日國內上下，皆昌言政治鎮敗，而究測紛紜，莫衷，是。茲且置貧汚之弊於勿論，但就通常行政效率言之。施政者非必皆庸闇者流，奉行者未嘗無廉飭之士，然而官民常失　　　上下難期合作，其故何　？論者以為目下官塲之　病，以泄沓為能事，以敷衍為手段，但知回護體面，不暇勸恤民陷，實為造成　劣現象之總因。唯其回護體面，故夸誕矯飾，漫無準則。明明事　難行，偏以口頭示惠；明明施行在即，猶斥謠傳無稽·失民信心，莫此為甚。唯其罔恤民隱，故禁例如毛，苛擾交加，朝令暮改，恍若置棋。民間縱有甚大之損失，亦祇諉為遭遇而不顧。如此，則人心渙散之不遑，又安有合作之可期？及今補救之道，從政者宜矢剔厲圍治之精神，而以收拾人心為亟務。樹官方之信譽，博人民之愛戴。一公告之頒布，一談話之發表，事先務經審滇之考慮，事後確定不拔之意志，以事實爲依歸，母空言而徒託。朝三暮四，狙公之譎拔，掩耳盜鈴，愚人之拙行，尤當懸為厲禁，永弗蹈犯。人民疊遭凋摧，原巳憔悴可念，亦唯飢渴之餘，易為食飲。在位者誠能體及微細，善加撫慰，申其惻隱惓篤之意，多予休養生息之機，則萬衆一貫，寗不知感？愛戴之念既生，聯繫之效斯覩。官民合作之基礎既奠，進而謀全面政治之刷新。吾人所熱烈佇盼者，此其三。</p>
<p>凡上所述，誠嫌籠統。等常談於老生，儘耳熟之能詳。然而事實昭示，舍此曷圖？果能克副吾願，要為慰情有餘。縱未必詢衆謀之僉同，亦庶幾達輿誦於萬一耳</p>
<h3>杜魯門招待記者稱　援華問題考慮中　將於相當時間提交國會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕杜錢門總統卅日在記者招待會中披露，援華問題巳在考慮中，並將於相當時間將此項問題提交國會。同時，總統間接披露，援華問題在政府議程上並非首要問題，不致列於提交國會之第一批要求中。渠稱再予國民政府之美援事將包括於渠致新國會之諮文內。但杜氏指出技術上講來，現行援助計劃直至明年四月一日方告滿期，屆時為經濟合作總署之目前基金用完之時。據一般解釋，總統此言意卽政府認為將此事提交國曾以前尙有許多時日之謂。</p>
<p>杜魯門在宣佈目前中國政府乃全世界所公認之政府時稱，代理國務卿羅維特指中共控制目前中國政府諸領袖，包括蔣總統在內係戰犯一節，實令人不可思議，羅氏此言頗確。</p>
<p>總統在答覆一項問題時稱，渠並未指定再與蔣夫人會談日期，但此點並未抹去蔣夫人如要求再會談一次，渠將加以接見之機會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅一日電〕某高級政府官員卅一日稱：在杜魯門總統之新預算中，將以增加援助中國之規定。</p>
<p>國務院發言人麥克唐特否認美國將中止援華，渠稱：中國政府現仍繼續自八十屆國會通過之四億美元經濟及軍事援助計劃下獲得援助，但國務院之此項解釋，不過係述及業已存在之援助計劃之繼續，四億美元之中，幾乎已動用四分之三。</p>
<p>高級政府官員並未指出杜魯門計劃停止目前正在進行之援助計劃，但渠堅稱：除非中國政府革新其領導權，行政當局不致提出進一步之行動。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅一日電〕杜魯門總統可望要求民主黨新國會增加稅收卅五億元。據稱，杜魯門將在預算咨文中稱，除非加稅，下屆會計年度政府將入不敷出。咨文將於下週提交國會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三十日電〕美國今日着手草擬最後計劃，以便奠定擴大防範蘇聯之新政策，官方希望能迅速加以完成。草案內容將為杜魯門總統新年致國會咨文之基礎。總統已令國務部調整援外計劃之各方面，全部援外方案之初步工作，已由國務部，經合總署與軍事當局擬就。最後方案係集各種個別方案完成之，其內容如下：（一）參加北大西洋聯防條約，簽約國包括美國，加拿大及西歐聯盟五國。（二）給予西歐各國軍事援助，以增强其反蘇力量。（三）給予非共產中國以任何合理的援助。（四）進行馬歇爾計劃第二度度對歡援助。（五）繼續進行對希臘，十耳其軍事援助，以阻止蘇聯在近東擴張。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕當杜魯門今日舉行記者招待會之時，巴克萊與駐蘇大使史密斯已同機返抵華府。史氏證實渠已向總統提出辭呈，史氏稱：「余當然希望總統會接受辭呈，余在國外已達七年之久，現實為返來之時」。巴克萊稱，在渠訪歐期間，從未進入蘇佔區，因此並未會見任何蘇人。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓卅日電〕杜魯門總統今日告新聞記者稱，本週初渠曾在甘塞斯城毅然發表談話，當時渠力言若干蘇聯領袖意欲取得美國之諒解，同時渠並指責蘇聯政府具有一套實非道德之道德，且撕毀波茨坦與雅爾達之協定。渠對於蘇聯政府藐視國際協定一事，表示遺憾，並稱，渠感覺抱歉，因蘇聯人民本身乃一偉大之民族。</p>
<p>今日當新聞記者堅請解釋渠之演辭時，杜魯門答稱，渠所發表者淸晰無隱。渠稱，渠尙未與可認為對美友好之蘇聯領袖保持接觸。記者問，下屆副總統巴克萊在柏林與美軍空運人員共渡聖誕，巴氏是否已晤及蘇聯代表，奠定未來美蘇談判之墓礎。杜氏答稱，此種猜測實屬過份，此項傳聞亦屬無稽。</p>

<h3>蘇責詢麥帥武裝日本　杜魯門發表談話　認爲此說完全毫無根據</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十日電〕國務院發言人三十日指所傳麥克阿瑟元師曾建議美國應採取行動以重新武裝日本之說為「毫無根據」。後來杜魯門總統在記者招待會中答覆一項問題時稱，渠從未聞及麥帥曾下令重建日本軍隊及重築被戰事損毀之日本公路之說。</p>

<p>負債總數逾二千五百億</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅一日電〕美政府於進入一九四九年時之財政情形，大致如下：（一）今後十二個月中，如能收支相抵，係屬幸事，但非加稅恐不易致此。（二）政府所負舊債，幾六倍於其收入，且至少六分之一於一九四九年到期。惟政府為一欠使老手，自有辦法，倘無餘款可以償還，即借新債以償舊債，需款愈多，則所借亦愈多。政府一九四八年之支出捷四百二十億美元，收支相抵不足十億美元以上。負儷之數巳超過二千五百廿億美兀，每年利息需五十三億。最重要者則為政府之財政運用，對於一般商業及就業情形之影響，政府為全國最大之買主雇主及付息者，其所付利率之高下，可使整個經濟為之改觀。若政府提高利率，則將間接增加商業利率，而减少其活動，此為一種反通貨膨脹行動·一九四八年美政府在金融方面採反通貨膨脹政策：（一）將六月底止財政年度內之預算盈餘，償還舊欠達五十億美元。（二）以出售儲蓄公債所得償付聯邦準備銀行等所持有之債券，以减少資金供應或購買力·（三）穩定可以銷售之政府公債利息在週息二厘半，而提高其他短期庫券之利息至一厘以上，但因償還一部份舊債，及以利息較低之新庫券代替舊債券，故其利息支出足以相抵。一九四九年到期之政府債券，均與一九四八年相等，合計約在一千一百億元弱，一部份大約將以發行新儷券儷　之。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎卅日電〕聯合國安理會印尼代表巴拉爾今日向記者稱：「印尼共和國領袖一日被拘及荷軍一日不撤至原防，則印尼對荷蘭，卽一日無談判之可能」。荷蘭蔑視安理會停戰令，迫使印尼軍繼續抵抗直至荷蘭本部與東印度在軍事經濟與財政上筋疲力盡而後已，荷蘭正謀設立片面控制之印尼聯邦臨時政府。荷籣總理狄里斯印尼之行，無非欲張設煙幕，以防外國千涉。荷籣佔計征服印尼之時間，已自三個月擴大至九個月。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕印尼發言人狄傑赫狄谷許莫三十日發表文告稱：亞洲人民對安理會之處置印尼問題，深表失望。渠繼稱：「我希望美國政府將繼續施展壓力，俾在公正及適當之基礎上解決印尼問題，印尼之獨立決不能被阻，全部東南亞之利益均與此項奪鬥有關」。渠稱：印尼將以「游擊戰及焦土政策」對付荷蘭。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕名列本市公教人員物資供應委員會配售十二月份實物之公教機關一百卅四單位，其存兌金銀之許可證，現已全部發訖，其中除抽籤在卅號以前之各公教機關，業已繳款領得黃金外，卅一號起及以後各號，市銀行已定於一月一日起，至四日止，每日上午九時至下午五時，逐日辦理收取證件及現鈔手續。各公教機關每單位可派代表二人，在規定時間內，持回所有許可證，身份證，及現鈔，送交九江路市銀行。市銀行亦即逐日將收到證件及現鈐，送交中央銀行，作為交割之手續。而實際審核及發兌黃金手續，則將延至五日以後開始辦理。倘審核階段發現有手續不合者，仍將退還款項證件，不准存兌。又市銀行一日至四日收取證件及現鈔手績，係按各單位代表到達先後，排隊為序，至將來發兌黃金時，仍按原有抽籤號數為序，辦法另行公告。</p>
<p>國營事業八單位　據理力爭獲解決</p>
<p>又國營事業八單位之存兌事宜，迭經該單位等推派代表與國行副總栽劉攻芸接洽，本因存兌辦法變質而幾擱淺，後經據理力爭，聞亦已獲得解決。辦法係由國行撥出黃金一筆，按八單位平均分派。而各單位職工人數多寡不等，多者如兩路局職工共逾九千人，每人祗能分得約一錢，他如電訊局，每人約可分得兩錢。惟因分割為難，各單位有計劃委託銀樓業鎔製為紀念戒，然後分發各職工佩帶。八單位職工，於聆悉國行當局允准照兌黃金之消息後，雖未能滿足一兩黃金之慾望，惟尚覺聊勝於無云。</p>
<h3>吳司長匆匆來去　商存兌技術問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕存兌金銀新辦法，遲遲未見公佈，財部為昭鄭重計，昨日派遣該部錢幣司司長吳興周來滬，與國行當局洽商各項存兌技術問題。吳氏抵濟後，婁於上午十時許，至外　中央銀行會議室，與國行副總裁劉攻芸，業務局副局長李筱莊，金管局局長畢德林等，進行會商。聞吳氏在席間　詢國行過去辦理存兌情形甚詳。至對新存　辦法技術　　如何改進，如何防止購得者再轉輾牟利各點　與　　雖表示會中並未提及，惟眾信必有一番詳細之檢討，以供財部於草擬新辦法時作為參考。昨日會議，迄十一時許始散，因係探討性質，故外界企盼會後立即公佈存兌新辦法一事，並未實現。而吳司長亦匆匆携具此次會議中所得意見，於昨晚返京覆命。</p>
<h3>本月配米六日發售　十一月未領配米　四日前仍得續購</h3>
<p>吳市長昨在市府召開第三十九次中美糧食會報，到美援運用會，美經濟合作中國分署，糧食部緊急購儲會，民食調配處各代表，會後據民食調配處負責人宣稱：（一）一月份配米現正撥運全市各家米店，決於一月六日開售，至卅一日截止，（二）配價將於三日召開三人小組會譏核定，於四日公告，（三）近因又有碎米積存，一月份仍將仿照過去辦法，每證十五市斤，將搭配碎米三市斤，其餘十二市斤為整米。另據該會消息：此項會議決定，對十二月份計配米，暫停配給，延至將來結束時，再行補配。至本市重點配米，一月份仍繼續舉辦，配給辦法照舊。</p>
<p>又一月份計口配售米證，民調處已於去年年底送發各區公所轉發。並定於一月五日發訖，凡在卅七年十一月份辦好本市戶籍登記並已領得本市國凡身份證者，均應領得一月份配售米證，如有在規定期內未領到者，務希於一月八月以前向所屬甲長處領取，逾期不再補發。各甲長應於一月九日將該甲簽發清單連同米發餘證，送繳保辦公處，十日由各保造具該保分發憑證報告書，連同各甲繳回之餘證及簽發清單，送繳區公所，再由各區公所於十一日彙送調配處核收。市民領到配售米證後，應在證上填明本人身份證字號，及所屬保甲戶次，各配售米店於配售食米時得請購米人出示身份證，以資核對。該處為便利市民購米起見，一月份仍指定慮灣，嵩山，高橋，虹口，江灣等五區辦理指定米店配售。至於去年配米，聞有數區，因市民集中若干米店購買，致有擠售一空者，記者昨以此詢問調配處有何補救之道，據其發言人答稱：凡此少許缺米米店，本處已於卅·卅一兩日內補充竣事，照例應各限於卅一日截止配售，以便各米店照章於翌日向跟行繳款結束賬目，但翌日適逢元旦，銀行須至五日開市收款，因有此特殊情形，市民凡在一月四日以前購米，不影響米店五日晨繳款者，自當樂予接受，而米店亦不致拒絕云。</p>
<h3>公教領實物配給　應一律憑身份證</h3>
<p>本市公教物供會息，卅八年一月份起，各公教機關員工領取配售實物及米麵代金或換發差額金，應先出示國民身份證或機關服務證，俾資慎重。</p>

<h3>從用電數量看工業興衰　三四月產率最高　秋季受限價迫害</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自工業用電之數字上，檢討卅七年各月份之工業生產，除十一月因上海電力公司機器損壞不斷抽電而致激减外，其餘大致保持平穩狀態。本市之工業用電，百分之八十七以上為美商上海電力公司所供應，故該公司之工業用電統計，足以反映本布工業之一般情况。去年一月份該公司之工業用電約為五千二百萬度，內二千九百萬度用於紡織業。二月份用電量减為四千三百萬度，內紡織工業减為二千四百萬度。三月份回昇至五千一百萬度，內二千九百萬度用於紡織業。四月份用電量為五千三百萬度，內紡識業佔二千八百萬度以上。五月份工業用電回降至四千八百萬度，內紡織業佔一千五百萬度。六月份用電數字為五千萬度弱，紡織業為二千六百萬度左右。此外七月份之用電量為四千八百萬度，八月份為四千七百萬度，九月份為四千六百萬度，十月份為四干八百萬度，均無大出入。至十一月份時，因電力廠機器損壞，大量抽電，工業生產乃見减退，但此為不正常之現象，而並非工業本身萎縮之故，此點不容誤解。十二月份之用電量即恢復舊觀，與十月份相接近，甚至可能超過。綜觀全年各月之工業用量，以四月為最高，據業中人解釋，此時期為工業上之旺月，因氣候溫和，不寒不熱，工人精神煥發，生產率特高，故用電量亦特多。秋季九十月份本亦屬　月，但令年因受硬性限價之害，工業用電量才見提高。</p>
<h3>被阻平津航郵　全部到目的地</h3>

<h3>謀害立委案開審　被告供出隱情　叔祖姦其妻　開槍圖洩憤　原告稱係借錢尋釁</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地院孟庭柯庭長，昨午開審立委張鵝齡被某侄孫張光孚槍殺未遂一案，結果諭令改期再審。此案據被告所供，則其內幕為一桃色糾紛引起之血案。緣有桂籍張光孚者，去年九月，　妻由桂赴京，同住於叔祖（現任桂籍立法委員）張鵝齡家中。今年十一月十一日，南京因疏散人口，光孚偕妻來滬，乘輪赴漢，取道粵漢路，轉返廣西原籍，於赴漢途中，光孚抱子小便時，其妻頗受感動，良心發現，始告知其夫，伊於今年二月間，曾被叔祖鵝齡強姦多次，並書就一信，致伊之胞姊（光孚之小姨），說明鵝齡曾囑伊介紹其胞姊，與鵝齡成就好事，促令其胞姊當心，勿蹈伊之覆轍，陷入鵝齡穀中，請伊夫將此信帶付在京之胞姊。光孚聞訊，氣憤填膺，將妻送抵原籍安頓後，書就鵝齡</p>
<p>罪狀一紙，長達六千餘字，連同其妻所交付之信，即乘車返至衡陽，以一萬餘元之代價，購得機票一張，重返京滬。至十二月五日，光孚前往本市林森中路一七七七號張鵝齡家，將所帶之罪狀及信出示，兩人言談間，發生爭吵，鵝齡之妻吳淑英聞聲，由樓上走下，初則斥責鵝齡行為失檢，繼則夫婦間互吵，旋乃遷怒於光孚，淑英大罵光孚為「烏龜·王八」，並迫令光孚立刻離去，否則當以</p>
<p>殺害相加。光孚憤怒之下，遂舉自備手槍，連發四次，傷鵝齡左腋，淑英上前勸阻，左腕亦受微傷。經報警後，案移地檢處偵查，以殺人未遂罪，對光孚提起公訴。地院昨午開審，提到光孚供稱：</p>
<p>現年二十九歲，鵝齡為　五服外之叔祖，自三十一年起，即協助鵝齡經營厚生公司，做土產生意，充任經理等職，以迄於今。今年十一月尚襄助鵝齡，往來各地，經營金條生意，收入頗豐。並稱：我誠心助染經營生意，渠竟強姦我的妻子，使我</p>
<p>非常痛苦。張鵝齡及其妻淑英，均到庭應訊，否認曾有強姦情事，指稱光孚係為借錢不遂，洩憤謀殺云云。唐姓證人稱當日因事至張家，在會客室中，曾聞有借錢爭執之語。庭上以雙方各執一詞，　令調集證件後，改期至元月十日再審，被告還押。至十二時四十分退庭。</p>

<h3>回力意外失常　空校昨晚大捷　遠征軍今晚戰華聯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕枕州空軍軍官學校籃球隊昨晚第三戰，對本市勁旅回力，觀眾五百餘人，回力以廿八比五十慘敗，上半時回力十二，空校三十。空校連戰三晚，表演成績，突飛猛晋，該隊實力，令人括目相看。上半時空校表演特佳，五將有似生龍活虎，朱廖孫三人更覺威風。回力僅賴成章得分，遂成脫節現象。下半時回力孟憲成吳成章二人先後受傷，陳綫愈亂，卒告敗北。昨晚回力演出之失常，實出乎意料，漏洞太多，使空校得暢所欲為。比賽情形如後：</p>
<p>比賽於七時開始，接觸之下，空校廖學文罰中，回力尚崇岳空校孫煥庭互中一球，不久空校即以五比二佔先。回力拼命反攻，戰成七平，吳成章二分追出，不料對方連中三球，依然落後，成十三比九，仍見空校盛勢。動作靈活，猖獗籃下，有投必中，回力為之瞠目。二十比九時，回力田福海易出王永芳，繼又成廿八比十二，空校以袁世銑替李復明，上午時空校三十，回力十二，殊出人意料。</p>
<p>休息過後，兩軍再戰，空校孟憲成代魏戍，吳成章射入，袁世銑罰球得點，田福海又告破籃，形勢有異。官校遂停，果見廖學文探入，斯時兩軍鏖戰，回力孟憲成脚骨受傷下場。尚祟岳入代，戰局進入拉鋸，至卅六比廿一後，官校又見順手。學文煥庭輪流中的，連獲四球，四四比廿一，回力輸在一半以上，時間完畢，空校以五〇比廿八擊退回力，捷報再傳。</p>

<h3>金城歲寒圖</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　宋麟</p>
<p>〔本報蓄州廿六日航訊）騙州自入冬以來，剛零極少，時疫不斷的發現，據省測候所統計：今年冬天的降雪量，是五年來最少的一年·廿二日「冬至」，西伯利亞冷氣壓侵襲全國，黃河上游各地氣溫江寒，西北普降瑞雪，蘭州也鵝毛紛飛，一夜北風，頓成銀裝世界。一連四五夭，都在時陰時雪中，以致本週的航班機一律脫班。本市專科以上的新生，入學不及兩週，便放了寒假。中小學校原來規定在明年元月十五日綫放寒假，但今天因為氣候嚴寒，各校經費有限，冬煤無着，也紛紛提前考試，本月底便將放假了。</p>
<p>攝氏零下九度九</p>
<p>在攝氏零下九度九的氣候中，物價頻頻飛昇，煤斤每百公斤竟賣到一百二十元，猶不易採購到，平民寒窘的景况，可以想像得之。至於一般貧民呢，仍舊由每年一度的冬令救濟委員會籌款賑濟。據一個多月的調查統計：全市貧民是八·四六八戶，但經最後的「覆查」，決定以「非救不活」的貧民為對象，初步核减為七·九二六戶，共一萬四千餘人。該會捐募的冬賑款九千五百餘元，發售冬令救濟獎券盈餘一萬五千一百七十六元，速同省撥救濟款共三萬餘元，已決定購齊麵粉等實物分區發放。從前由西北經京滬還鄉的東北義勇軍及其眷屬們，如今又紛紛重來西北，有的打算仍到新疆去過流浪的艱苦歲月。這次市府也籌到一筆款物，發給他們，共計發出救濟金五千五百卅元，棉衣五十九套。籌集貧民賑款的工作，現在仍在以各種方式繼續辦理，小學生們已自動的舉行兩天音樂演奏會，為苦難的同胞們求取一絲的溫鉋。</p>
<p>掃糧隊三掃大戶</p>
<p>從十月份起，全省發動的冬賑工作，據社會處發言人估計：全省可能募得糧食一萬市石，救濟金十萬兀，比較歷年募得最多之款物，尙超出數倍，有若千縣份，且已發放完竣。據說這是社會一般人士，明瞭此項工作的重要性，而紛起饗應的。不過少數的土豪劣紳，不但對這種救濟工作，顯得吝嗇，就是應行繳納的田賦，也一再頑抗，使原定今年年底征足的田賦，迄今尙未征足九成。尤其是蘭州市，情形更來的特殊，至今僅征足五成。市府為完成功令，近日組成「掃糧隊」到各區去催征，有幾個大戶，如車子權，張子厚，張念祖等，欠糧都在十石以上，任憑「掃糧隊」三「掃」其門，都消極的來個「將軍不見面」，抗不繳納。市府據報後，巳限定日期繳淸，否則卽請省府嚴懲了。</p>
<p>鐘聲舞影共催眠</p>
<p>廿五日的聖誕節，在西北還不大盛行，只有各敎會團體分別舉行接聖嬰禮，大禮彌撒，音樂祟拜晚會，獻詩會等節目，祗因冬防戒嚴關係，原定子夜舉行的接聖嬰典禮，運至天明才舉行。這夜有幾處藉聖誕為名的高等家庭，燈紅酒綠，蓬拆終脊，宏亮的敎堂鐘聲，却做了他（她）們的「催眠曲」。</p>

<h3>桐油趨勢平靜</h3>

<h3>今年我國對外易貨　着重南洋英鎊集團　中信局負責人指出其優點有三</h3>
<p>中央信託局息，該局鑑於過去與法意等國易貨，我國能輸出之商品種類甚少，而易來之商品，亦不足我國之需要。故今（卅八）年度易貨對象，將着重於南洋一帶之英鎊集團。發言人指出南洋一帶，其工業發達之程度，不優於我國。我國之絲綢紡織品搪瓷熱水瓶等工業產品，均可一一輸出。同時並可由南洋一帶輸入棉花橡膠等工業原料，而有助於我國工業之復與。證之去年我國因未與南洋英鎊集團展開易貨，多種原料，如棉花等類，遂不能大量取得。而南洋英鎊集團各邦對外貿易，多以易貨為手段，欲取得其物資，非交換不可。以我國與南洋地位之接近，將來易貨一旦展開，其優點為（一）南洋英鎊集團內華僑甚多，對於我國商品之推銷，大有帮助，進而奠立我國商品在南洋之地位。（二）我國最需要之物齊，南洋均有出產。我國之工農業產品，南洋需用種類及數量亦較他國為多。如此輸出額可以增加，雙方均屬有利。（三）加强與英鎊集團間之貿易連繫，可以緩和我國美元外匯之缺乏。</p>

<h3>中膛決以化肥萬噸　直接與農民換稻榖</h3>

<h3>新年百態</h3>
<p>元旦談往</p>
<p>古代對於新年，有種種習俗。荆楚歲時記云：「正月一日，長幼悉正衣冠，以次拜賀，進椒柏酒，飲桃湯，進屠蘇酒，膠牙　，下五辛盤。」又云：「元旦日，貼畫鷄於戶，懸董索於其上，挿符其旁，百鬼畏之。」現在這些舊例，大都已久不奉行，祗在詩文中，當作故實徵引而已。</p>
<p>翻閱淸同治十二年的本報，中有一段云：「正月朔日為元且有慶賀祝拜等禮。上自天子，下及庶民；上自刺廷，下及鄉里，英不皆然。夏商以前，雖不能考；成周之世，此禮已行，自兩漢以至今日，此禮相沿而未之或改也。漢時元且之日，羣臣於朝賀之際，奉觴獻椒酒以上壽，今則有朝賀之禮，而無獻酒之儀。內則王公大臣，朝賀於殿廷宮闡，外則封疆大吏，以及府廳州縣，各於其地，互相慶賀。民間祀祖先之後，亦其屠蘇之酒，卑者先敬其尊，幼者先進其長，相遞而飲，至最卑幼而止。今則無徧飲屠蘇之禮，猶有慶賀元且之儀。家禮旣畢，互相走賀於宗族親戚僚友鄰里之家，俗則為之拜年。中國定例，文武官員，改歲之時，封印一月，可以少事偸閒，非有緊急要事，均可延至開印以後辦理。封印則以臘月二十日為期，開印則以正月二十日為度，至於小有變通，先後亦不過一日而已。開印以後各官照例辦事，而年事亦畢矣。</p>
<p>春聨紀舊</p>
<p>從前的春聯，有的寫「新年納餘慶，佳節號長春」；或「帝德乾坤大，皇恩雨露深」。民國初年，盛行「事共和幸福，作目由國民」一聯，十六年後為「打倒帝國主義，廢除不平條約」。</p>
<p>元旦書紅</p>
<p>元旦書紅也是一種舊習慣，書房中的牆上粘一條紅紙，寫着「元旦書紅，萬事享通」八個大字，字必正楷，一筆不苟，非常規矩，此紙每年元旦更換一次，無非取吉利之意。</p>
<p>上元燈</p>
<p>上元燈以紙製，淡黃的，大紅的都有，上面畫着各式圖像，或者貼些金字金花，富麗非常，形狀以扁而且圓的為多。這本是正月半的點綴品，然在除夕前市上早已出售了。「上元」亦寫作「狀元」大約祝其利市。兒童對此，最為歡迎，式樣改變一點，便成為獅十燈，兎子燈之類，是最通行的新年玩具。</p>
<p>第一個陽歷元旦</p>
<p>三十七年前的今日，上海軍政府長官陳其美發佈一張吿示：</p>
<p>「為出示曉諭事：本日（陰曆十一月十二日）奉大總統孫諭令，以本月十三日為陽曆元且日，我民國百度維新，亟應及時更用陽曆，期與世界各强國同進文明，一新耳目等因，為此布告軍民。各軍人等知悉：以黃帝紀元四千六百〇九年十一月十三日着改為中華民國元年正月第一日。從前行用陰曆，一律變更。孫大總統卽擇於元年旦就任，發號施令，與天下更始。合亟出示曉諭，咸仰知悉。自明日起，各界一律懸掛國旗，以昭慶賀，而光大典。切切特示！」</p>
<p>國父元旦宣誓文</p>
<p>民國元年元旦下午六時，國父乘雙馬車至元帥府，由黃克强先烈導入休息室，旋登大禮堂就大總統職，徐紹楨司儀，國父宣誓，文曰：「傾覆滿洲專制政府，鞏固中華民國，圖謀民主幸福，國民之公意，文實遵之，以忠於為國服務，至專制政府旣倒，國內無棼亂，民國卓立於世界，為列邦公認，斯時文當解臨時大總統之職，謹以此誓於國民。中華民國元旦，孫文。」</p>
<p>美國人的元旦</p>
<p>美國人在除夕，大都換了入時的衣服，出外游行，手握花紙，隨便擲在任何人的身上，也有帶了樂器，盡情在街頭暢奏一下的。至於有女朋友的，往往携手同行，喁喁情話。大城市中，入夜街上行人，且歌且舞，歡迎新年，至午夜十二時敎堂裏的鐘聲齊嗚。這樣要鬧到四五點鏟，才興盡回家。</p>
<p>日本人的元旦</p>
<p>日本人在元旦，門口須放兩株松樹，與竹梅合紮而成。門框也用稻草撚好，中間放只橘子，再糊些白紙條，這樣妖魔便不敢侵入了。天未明時，闔家的人，都已起身，登高去看日出，默祝一年佳運，有如旭日初升。回家後又面東而立，大家都要喝一口酒，據說可避邪氣云。</p>
<p>跳神打鬼</p>
<p>喇嘛在新年，有跳神打鬼之戲，頭戴面具作鬼形，唱歌跳舞，以胡笳和之，其聲凄厲，云可驅邪。按南美洲土人，新年亦有此俗，謂之賽神會，與會者均戴假面具，跳躍舞蹈，以為歡樂。至所供奉之神，則大小不一，大者高至一丈，小者祗有二三尺而已。</p>
<p>賀年片</p>
<p>自一八七五年發明賀年片以來，美國仕女寄發賀年片的狂熱，一年甚於一年。一九四二年全美國發售的賀年片，共達十二萬萬張，其所耗郵資在美金六千萬元以上。</p>

<h3>President Issues New Year's Day Message: Key to War or Peace Lies with the Communists; Constitution Cannot Be Violated, National Independence and Integrity Must Be Maintained; Army Should Be Guaranteed, People Must Maintain Freedom of Life</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] President Chiang Kai-shek recently issued a New Year's Day message for the 38th year of the Republic of China. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, today is the founding anniversary of the 38th year of the Republic of China. Since the founding of the Republic of China by the Father of the Nation's advocacy of the National Revolution, a full thirty-seven years have passed. During this long period, revolutionary martyrs and patriotic soldiers and civilians shed blood and sacrificed themselves, fought steadfastly, endured setbacks, and experienced hardships before the Constitution could be implemented and constitutional government established. Today, holding the first founding anniversary after the establishment of the constitutional government, we deeply feel that time has been wasted and that the cause of national construction has been so delayed. The Three Principles of the People have not been realized, and we are truly filled with shame and remorse. Tracing back to after the end of the War of Resistance, the government's sole policy was peaceful construction, and the government's primary task was to recover the Northeast, which had been occupied for fourteen years, in order to maintain the integrity of our national territory and sovereignty. However, for three years, the policy of peaceful construction has been obstructed, and the work of receiving the Northeast has failed. In the past year alone, since the loss of Jinan, Jinzhou, Changchun, and Shenyang have fallen successively, and the tragedy of the September 18th Incident has been re-enacted in the nine northeastern provinces. The areas where industry and commerce are concentrated in East China and North China, and the cities where academic culture gathers, are today all threatened by banditry. The government's aspirations to defend the country and save the people have not been achieved, and the crisis of the nation has become more serious. This is due to Chiang Kai-shek's personal lack of leadership and improper measures, which have failed to live up to the trust placed in him by the people. I am truly ashamed and terrified, and should first blame myself.</p>
<p>Today, the military suppression of the rebellion has entered a critical stage. The survival of the nation, the rise and fall of the people, and the continuation of historical culture will all be decided in this stage. The freedom or enslavement, life or death, of every one of our compatriots and every family will also be decided in this stage. How to overcome this difficulty and overcome this crisis has become a matter of great concern to every one of our compatriots, and everyone feels the great importance of the government's current decisions, because the military suppression of bandits has increased the burden on the people and deepened their suffering. Even millionaires hope that the war will end as soon as possible and peace will be realized as soon as possible. Therefore, the question of war or peace lingers in the hearts of every compatriot, and the government's choice of war or peace is even more concerned by every compatriot. Chiang Kai-shek, entrusted by the people and responsible for the country, should conduct a detailed review of the current situation and give deep consideration to the hopes of the people.</p>
<p>Only Hoping Peace Can Be Realized, Personal Advance or Retreat is Absolutely Not a Concern</p>
<p>The Father of the Nation said, "The purpose of the founding of the Republic of China is peace." As a believer in the Three Principles of the People, Chiang Kai-shek, inheriting the teachings of the Father of the Nation, was originally unwilling to follow the war against Japan with the military suppression of bandits, in order to increase the suffering of the people. Therefore, as soon as the War of Resistance ended, our government immediately raised the policy of peaceful construction, and further used political consultations and military mediation methods to solve the Communist Party problem. Unexpectedly, after a year and a half, the Communist Party obstructed all agreements and plans, making them unable to be implemented according to the expected steps. And finally, it launched a full-scale armed rebellion, endangering the survival of the country. Our government was forced to endure the pain and mobilize to engage in suppressing the rebellion. This is the recent historical fact, fresh in the minds of the world. Communism has been developing in China for twenty-five years, and in these twenty-five years, Chiang Kai-shek has always expected the Communist Party to take the nation as the premise, restore the normal course of party politics, and jointly seek ways of peaceful coexistence, in order to establish the grand rules of democracy. For three years, the purpose of political consultations has been peace, and the purpose of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion has also been peace. But today, whether the situation is for war or peace, whether the people are blessed or cursed, the key lies not with the government, nor can it be achieved by the one-sided hopes of our compatriots for the government. It must be known that the decision of this problem rests entirely with the Communist Party. Whether the country can turn danger into safety and whether the people can turn disaster into blessing depends on a change of heart on the part of the Communist Party. Therefore, our compatriots, in order to solve this problem, must first ask the Communist Party what their intentions are for peace. As long as the Communist Party has the sincerity for peace and can make a definite expression, the government will sincerely discuss and be willing to discuss concrete methods for stopping the war and restoring peace. As long as the peace talks do not harm the independence and integrity of the country, but help the people to recuperate and rest. As long as the sacred Constitution is not violated by me, and democratic constitutionalism is not destroyed because of this, the national system of the Republic of China can be ensured. The legal system of the Republic of China will not be interrupted, the army has a real guarantee, and the people can maintain their free way of life and the current minimum living standards, then I personally have no other demands. Chiang Kai-shek has spent his life in revolution and has long put life and death out of consideration. Only hoping that peace can be realized, personal advance or retreat is absolutely not a concern, but only follows the public opinion of the people. If the Communist Party insists on continuing the armed rebellion to the end and has no sincerity for peace, then the government has only to fulfill its duty to defend the country and save the people, and it cannot but deal with the Communist Party to the end, especially in the Jing-Hu area, where the political center is located, and it must do its best to defend it and carry out a decisive battle. I firmly believe that the government not only has the confidence to win here, but also the key to the entire country turning danger into safety and the entire people turning disaster into blessing lies here. Our compatriots must know that today, only by the unity of the military and the people, adhering to this war of self-defense, and winning victory in the decisive battle, can we win true peace, and only by enduring temporary pain and sacrifice can we avoid the heavy iron curtain and the dark and dismal life of hell. Since I, Chiang Kai-shek, participated in the revolutionary war, it has been nearly forty years. In every long-term battle, I have experienced hardships, suffered setbacks, and endured slander. No matter how far I failed, I always held the belief that I would win, and in the end, I would be able to achieve success. It must be known that what we rely on is the national spirit, human justice, and world justice. The violence of the Communist bandits can rob us of the Northeast, but cannot conquer our national spirit, can invade our hinterland, but cannot insult the personality of our nation. Justice is the power to win, and public opinion will eventually overcome violence. Our generation has encountered unprecedented changes in the five thousand years of Chinese history, and we must also shoulder the unprecedented mission in the five thousand years of history. We can only endure temporary pain and sacrifice, and struggle for the survival of the country and nation, the continuation of historical culture, the freedom of lifestyle, and the growth of future generations.</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, at this time of renewal of the year, recalling the hardships of the Father of the Nation and the martyrs in creating the Republic of China, and understanding the pain of the soldiers and civilians on the front line fighting steadfastly, I feel that Chiang Kai-shek's personal responsibility is great and the duties are arduous, and I also firmly believe that my patriotic compatriots will never tolerate the Communist Party's liquidation, nor can they sit idly by and watch the country's peril. Only by the unity of the military and the people, the unity of the whole country, unity and struggle, ensuring our democratic and free life, doing our best to fulfill our duty to defend the country and protect the race, and reaping the fruits of the eight-year War of Resistance, can we comfort the spirits of our countless soldiers, civilians, and martyrs in heaven. The Father of the Nation said, "The final success belongs to the last effort," and I would like to encourage all my compatriots. (End)</p>
<h3>Founding Anniversary of the Republic of China: President Leads Hundreds of Officials to Worship at the Mausoleum; Central Radio Station Invites President Sun Fo to Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Tomorrow (1st) is the founding anniversary of the 38th year of the Republic of China. The President is scheduled to lead hundreds of civil and military officials to respectfully worship at the Father of the Nation's Mausoleum at 10:00 AM. The Presidential Palace will also hold a celebration and New Year's gathering at 11:00 AM. (News of New Year's Day celebrations in various places is published on page 2.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Presidential Palace is scheduled to issue a signature book at the Bureau of Ceremonies at 3:00 PM on New Year's Day to receive congratulations from diplomatic envoys in Beijing. In addition, Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng will hold a cocktail party at the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM to receive the diplomatic corps.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] To celebrate the New Year's Day of the 38th year of the Republic of China, the Central Broadcasting Station will invite Premier Sun Fo of the Executive Yuan to broadcast a speech to the nation on the afternoon of the 1st. The station will broadcast simultaneously to the country on medium wave "660" kHz, "420" meters, and short wave "730" kHz "31" meters, and will be rebroadcast simultaneously by radio stations across the country. In addition, in order to strengthen broadcasting to the bandits, the station has decided to jointly broadcast the anti-bandit broadcasting program organized by the Military Radio Station of the Ministry of National Defense from 5:15 PM to 7:00 PM every day starting from the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Military Radio Station of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, in celebration of New Year's Day, today specially invited Premier Sun Fo of the Executive Yuan (20:50), Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang (19:05), Commander-in-Chief of the Army Yu Hanmou (12:30), Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Gui Yongqing (20:00), and Director of the Political Work Bureau Deng Wenyi to come to the station and broadcast to the military and civilians of the country, as well as military bands, mass harmonica concerts, and experimental drama troupes performing Peking opera and other wonderful programs. The station's short wave is 24.6 meters, 12200 kHz, and the medium wave is 416.6 meters 720 kHz.</p>
<h3>Xu Yongchang's New Year's Broadcast Encourages Soldiers to Complete the Suppression of the Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Minister Xu of the Ministry of National Defense is scheduled to broadcast to officers and soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force across the country on New Year's Day at the military radio station, as well as to veterans in their hometowns. The original text roughly stated: The country is currently in a state of crisis and shock. Comrades, whether in the front or in the rear, are enduring hardship and difficulty. Therefore, Yongchang keenly feels the great responsibility of our soldiers, and at the same time, he is particularly concerned about the steadfast and outstanding spirit of all comrades. Although the battle line is vast and transportation is obstructed, making it impossible for us to personally comfort each and every one of you, I believe that the entire army, as well as our more than 190,000 retired and discharged officers and soldiers, have the same enthusiasm for saving the country from crisis and the same belief in the future of the country and the national army. In other words, Yongchang and the comrades scattered throughout the country are connected and unified in spirit. I hope that we can all base ourselves on this most precious connection and unity, unite sincerely, work hard, and achieve the tasks that each of us should fulfill.</p>
<p>Our main task now is naturally to suppress the rebellion. Talking about the success of suppressing the rebellion, military affairs naturally come first.

Everyone should realize the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country with the determination to become benevolent and take righteousness under the leadership of the Supreme Commander.</p>

<h3>New Year's Message for the Thirty-Eighth Year</h3>
<p>January 1st marks the beginning of a new year and the founding of the Republic. Every year on this day, celebrations are held. Spurred by this dual significance, and with a mix of emotions and melancholy, we feel the fleeting time is hard to grasp, but the future is attainable, and a spark of vitality accompanies the arrival of the new year. The end of the thirty-seventh year was marked by a low-pressure system enveloping Shanghai. Gloom and sorrow intertwined, and disasters multiplied. Everyone felt a sense of heaviness, and their actions showed signs of anxiety. This heaviness and anxiety should be a shared experience, not an individual's abnormality. Now, as we welcome the freshness of the thirty-eighth year, we want to dispel the misfortunes of the past. We do not wish to sing celebratory praises, nor to engage in complex political discussions. At this time, we offer humble wishes from the perspective of ordinary people:</p>
<p>Since the Japanese invaders wreaked havoc and spread poison everywhere, our country has endured eight years of sacred resistance, leaving it exhausted in body and spirit. The sudden arrival of victory brought joy to the world. The martyrs who shed their blood have made the ultimate sacrifice, gaining the ultimate reward. The survivors also hoped for a new opportunity for prosperity. However, peace did not last long, and chaos returned. With the onset of artillery fire, homes were reduced to ashes. The direct losses from the war were the wasteful destruction of countless lives and the displacement of large numbers of refugees. The indirect impact caused economic turmoil, disrupted livelihoods, and left people suffocating under a cloud of sorrow, longing for a return to normalcy. We sincerely hope that after the thirty-eighth year, the smoke of war will be extinguished forever, and families will once again find peace. May hostility be transformed into harmony, and the people be settled in comfort. May hundreds of millions of people be able to devote themselves to increasing production and jointly strive for the rejuvenation of the nation. This is our first sincere prayer.</p>
<p>Since the Second World War, the painful and devastating lessons have been deeply ingrained in people's hearts. If you were to ask Europeans and Americans about the need for war, almost all would express their firm opposition. However, the confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States hints at the brewing of future dangers. The Cold War in Berlin is intensifying. Playing with fire next to a pile of firewood, or practicing swimming in an unpredictable abyss, can easily lead to self-destruction. Lessons of the past remain, but no one heeds the warning. Does this crisis need further discussion? In reality, the United States and the Soviet Union do not share borders. In the past, they shared hardships. Even if they have differing ideologies and harbor mutual suspicions, they can still resolve their differences through other means of reconciliation. Why must they resort to war? If both sides can empathize with the common people, reflect on their own actions, follow the path of openness and sincerity, and abandon deception and suspicion, they can easily transform the current situation and stabilize the overall situation. Then, by gathering technical experts from various countries and strengthening the application of atomic energy, they can create extraordinary achievements for the medical community and open a new chapter in human history. This is our second earnest hope.</p>
<p>Today, people at all levels of our country are calling for political reform, but discussions are varied and inconclusive. Let's put aside the issues of corruption and focus on the efficiency of ordinary administration. Those who govern are not necessarily incompetent, and those who carry out orders are not necessarily corrupt. However, officials and the people often fail to connect, and cooperation between superiors and subordinates is difficult. Why is this so? Some argue that the current problem in officialdom is the emphasis on negligence and perfunctoriness, knowing only how to protect face and neglecting the suffering of the people. This is the root cause of the deterioration. Because of the desire to protect face, they exaggerate and embellish, lacking any standards. They offer empty promises when things are difficult to do, and deny obvious facts as rumors. This severely undermines the people's trust. Because they neglect the people's suffering, they impose strict rules and heavy taxes, changing policies frequently, as if playing a game of chess. Even if the people suffer great losses, they dismiss them as unfortunate circumstances and ignore them. In this situation, there is no hope for the people's unity, let alone cooperation. To remedy this, those in government should show a spirit of reform and prioritize winning back the hearts of the people. They should establish the credibility of the government and earn the love and respect of the people. Before issuing a public notice or making a speech, they should carefully consider it. Afterwards, they should maintain a firm and unwavering will, relying on facts and avoiding empty words. Changing policies frequently, like a monkey trainer deceiving his monkeys, or covering one's ears while stealing a bell, is foolish and should be strictly prohibited. The people have suffered repeated setbacks and are already weary and in need of care. They are easily swayed by food and drink when hungry and thirsty. If those in power can be considerate and show compassion, offering opportunities for rest and recovery, then the people will surely be grateful. Once love and respect are established, the effects of unity will be seen. With a foundation of cooperation between officials and the people, we can then strive for a comprehensive political reform. This is our third ardent expectation.</p>
<p>All of the above may seem general and commonplace. However, facts show that there is no other way. If we can fulfill these wishes, we will be greatly comforted. Even if we cannot achieve unanimous agreement, we hope to at least address a fraction of the public's concerns.</p>
<h3>Truman Tells Reporters That Aid to China Is Under Consideration; Will Submit to Congress in Due Course</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington Dispatch from the 30th] President Truman disclosed at a press conference on the 30th that aid to China is under consideration and that the issue will be submitted to Congress in due course. At the same time, the President indirectly disclosed that aid to China is not a top priority on the government's agenda and will not be among the first requests submitted to Congress. He said that further American aid to the Nationalist government would be included in his message to the new Congress. However, Truman pointed out that, technically, the current aid program will not expire until April 1 next year, when the Economic Cooperation Administration's current funds will be exhausted. It is generally interpreted that the President's statement means the government believes there is still much time before submitting the matter to Congress.</p>
<p>Truman said that while announcing that the current Chinese government is the government recognized by the whole world, it is inconceivable that Acting Secretary of State Lovett would call the leaders of the current Chinese government controlled by the Communists, including President Chiang, war criminals. Lovett's remarks were quite accurate.</p>
<p>Answering a question, the President said that he had not scheduled another meeting with Madame Chiang, but this did not eliminate the possibility of seeing Madame Chiang if she requested another meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington Dispatch from the 31st] A senior government official said on the 31st that Truman's new budget will include provisions for increased aid to China.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman McDermott denied that the United States would suspend aid to China, saying that the Chinese government continues to receive aid under the $400 million economic and military assistance program passed by the 80th Congress. However, the State Department's explanation only refers to the continuation of existing aid programs, and almost three-quarters of the $400 million has already been used.</p>
<p>The senior government official did not indicate that Truman planned to halt the ongoing aid program, but he insisted that the administration would not propose further action unless the Chinese government reformed its leadership.</p>

However, there are more and more people of various countries and nationalities who are realistic and resolutely face the realities of history, knowing that war has never been and can never be a panacea for healing human diseases after repeated trials, and therefore diligently seek other methods to lead mankind towards progress that can only be achieved by abolishing war and peacefully resolving all problems. This is a gratifying point.</p>
<h3>U.S. Financial Situation</h3>
<p>Deficit of $1 Billion Last Year</p>
<p>Total Debt Exceeds $250 Billion</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 31st dispatch] The U.S. government's financial situation at the beginning of 1949 is roughly as follows: (1) It would be fortunate if revenue and expenditure could be balanced in the next 12 months, but it will be difficult to achieve this without raising taxes. (2) The government's outstanding debt is almost six times its revenue, and at least one-sixth of it will mature in 1949. However, the government is a seasoned debtor and has its own ways. If there are no surplus funds to repay, it will borrow new debt to repay old debt. The more funds needed, the more it will borrow. The U.S. government's expenditure in 1948 was nearly $42 billion, with a deficit of more than $1 billion. The amount of debt has exceeded $252 billion, with annual interest of $5.3 billion. The most important thing is the impact of the government's financial management on the general business and employment situation. The government is the nation's largest buyer, employer, and interest payer, and the level of interest rates it pays can change the entire economy. If the government raises interest rates, it will indirectly increase commercial interest rates and reduce its activities, which is an anti-inflationary action. In 1948, the U.S. government adopted an anti-inflationary policy in finance: (1) Repaying $5 billion of old debt with the budget surplus in the fiscal year ending at the end of June. (2) Repaying bonds held by the Federal Reserve Banks and others with the proceeds from the sale of savings bonds to reduce the supply of funds or purchasing power. (3) Stabilizing the interest on government bonds that can be sold at 2.5% per annum while raising the interest on other short-term treasury bills to more than 1%. However, because of the repayment of a portion of old debt and the replacement of old bonds with new treasury bills with lower interest rates, its interest expenditure is sufficient to offset. The government bonds maturing in 1949 are the same as in 1948, totaling approximately slightly less than $110 billion, a portion of which will be repaid with the issuance of new bonds.</p>
<h3>Dutch Newspapers Attack the Arrest of the Indonesian President</h3>
<p>Netherlands Announces the Abolition of Censorship</p>
<p>[United Press Batavia 31st dispatch] Dutch military authorities announced on the 31st that military and political censorship of news in Indonesia has been lifted. At the same time, well-informed Dutch sources accused some domestic newspapers of making unfair attacks on Indonesian High Commissioner Beel, especially regarding Beel's "diplomatic blunders" such as the arrest of Indonesian President Sukarno. They claimed that the imprisonment of Indonesian leaders was decided in The Hague, and Beel was simply acting on orders. Beel was also attacked for allegedly ordering the United Nations military observers to withdraw from the battlefield, but this is not true.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit U.S. Dollar Ring Cracked in Chicago</h3>
<p>Four Japanese Ring Leaders Arrested</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 31st dispatch] According to Special Agent Bowman, Chicago special agents arrested four Japanese counterfeiters on the night of the 29th and seized four copper plates for printing $20 U.S. notes and 13 photographic negatives for printing $20 and $50 notes.

<h3>Indonesian Leaders Condemn the Security Council's Weakness on Dutch Actions; Unable to Make Any Fair Decisions Thus Far</h3>
<p>[United Press Singapore, 30th] A broadcast from the Indonesian Republic radio station "Somewhere in Sumatra" overheard here on the 30th stated that the Republic's army is concentrating in southern Sumatra to prevent Dutch paratroopers from landing. The broadcast said that the Republic's army will implement a scorched earth policy "without hesitation and thoroughly."</p>
<p>[United Press Singapore, 30th] A broadcast from the Indonesian Republic radio station "Somewhere in Sumatra" overheard here today stated that the Indonesian Republic's emergency government, led by Dr. Halim, issued a statement on the 29th condemning the Security Council's "feeble actions" regarding the Indonesian issue. The broadcast stated: "Information received indicates clearly that the Security Council has thus far been unable to make any fair and just decisions. The Indonesian people and government will continue to resist Dutch aggression and fight until they achieve complete independence." The broadcast also stated that the Republic's army "recaptured Pinchi, 18 kilometers from Medan, after fierce fighting."</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 30th] The Indonesian representative to the United Nations Security Council, Palar, told reporters today: "As long as the leaders of the Indonesian Republic are detained and as long as the Dutch troops do not withdraw to their original positions, there will be no possibility of negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands." He said that the Netherlands' disregard for the Security Council's ceasefire order is forcing the Indonesian army to continue to resist until the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies are militarily, economically, and financially exhausted. The Netherlands is plotting to establish a unilaterally controlled provisional Indonesian federal government. Dutch Prime Minister Drees's trip to Indonesia is nothing more than a smokescreen to prevent foreign interference. The Netherlands' estimated time to conquer Indonesia has been extended from three months to nine months.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 30th] Indonesian spokesman Djelaluddine Goegoes Soemoedi Ningrat issued a statement on the 30th stating: "The people of Asia are deeply disappointed with the Security Council's handling of the Indonesian issue." He continued, "I hope the United States government will continue to exert pressure to resolve the Indonesian issue on a fair and appropriate basis. Indonesia's independence must not be hindered; the interests of all of Southeast Asia are related to this struggle." He said that Indonesia will confront the Netherlands with "guerrilla warfare and a scorched earth policy."</p>

<h3>Gaoqiao District Office Urges Improvement of City Ferry Facilities</h3>
<p>Zhong Yuliang, the head of Gaoqiao District in this city, telegraphed the city government, the Maritime Administration Bureau, and the Pudong Association yesterday, as well as various relevant agencies, stating that the restrictions on the number of passengers carried by ships are very strict, and they have been abandoned for a long time. The supervisors have not interfered, and the city ferry company has been reorganized for two years. Old ships from 20 years ago are used, which is already dangerous, and carrying passengers over the limit is regarded as a normal thing. On Sundays, Mondays, and Saturdays, the number of passengers is especially crowded, and the number of passengers exceeds more than half of the capacity. However, every time there is a price increase, they are brave enough to be the pioneer of each ship, and they have never heard of business improvement. Moreover, using a long rectangular wharf without a bow, without a stern, and without a passenger license domino-style, the installation of machinery is used for long-distance passenger transportation, which is a bad precedent for the shipping industry. If this is not changed for a long time, the same mistake as the Jiangya Wheel can be used as a warning. In particular, an appeal is made to telegram the company to quickly improve, and to order all agencies to strictly investigate and protect passenger safety.</p>
<h3>Hotel Industry Requests Price Increase; Social Bureau Decides to Handle it Solemnly</h3>

In addition to the representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and the labor and management of the hotel industry, representatives from the City Council, the Police Bureau, the Civil Affairs Bureau, and the Finance Bureau will also be invited to participate in the detailed review to show solemnity. The adjustment request submitted by the hotel industry this time will be submitted for review at a meeting on January 3rd and 4th.</p>
<h3>Barber Shops Raise Prices by 50% Without Permission; Social Bureau Dissatisfied; Will Punish</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the publication of the lower-term index for December, some barber shops have already automatically increased prices by 50%. The Social Bureau expressed dissatisfaction with the industry's unauthorized price increase before being approved.

<h3>Movie Theaters to Increase Prices Starting Today</h3>

The new prices are: First-run from 10 yuan to 35 yuan, second-run from 8 yuan to 25 yuan, and third-run from 6 yuan to 15 yuan, effective today. The new prices were implemented last night in theaters showing new films last night. Because the two films "For Whom the Bell Tolls" and "Secrets of the Qing Palace" are special, the ticket prices are specially increased to four kinds: 15, 25, 30, and 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Year-end Bonus and Subsidy Issues; The Result of the Handling Meeting is Obtained</h3>

<h3>Public and Private Teachers' Deposit Exchange; All Agencies After the 31st; Payment Starts Today; Review and Exchange Will Be Handled Five Days Later</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The certificates of public and private teachers listed in the Shanghai Public and Private Personnel Material Supply Committee's allocation of in-kind goods for December, 134 units, have now been issued in full. Among them, the public and private agencies that were drawn before the 30th have already paid and received the gold. The City Bank has scheduled to handle the procedures for collecting certificates and cash from the 31st to the 4th of January, from 9 am to 5 pm every day. Each public and private agency can send two representatives to submit all the permits, ID cards, and cash to the City Bank on Jiujiang Road within the specified time. The City Bank will also send the received documents and cash to the Central Bank every day as a handover procedure. The actual review and exchange of gold procedures will be postponed until after the 5th. If any procedures are found to be inconsistent during the review stage, the payment documents will still be returned and the deposit exchange will not be allowed. In addition, the City Bank's collection of documents and cash from the 1st to the 4th is in the order of the arrival of the representatives of each unit. When the gold is exchanged in the future, it will still be in the order of the original draw number. The method will be announced separately.</p>
<p>Eight Units of State-Owned Enterprises Have Achieved Resolution Through Justification</p>
<p>In addition, the deposit exchange matters of eight units of state-owned enterprises have been discussed with Liu Gongyun, the vice president of the State Bank, by representatives sent by the units. Originally, it was almost shelved due to the change in the nature of the deposit exchange method. Later, after justification, it was heard that a solution has been obtained. The method is that the State Bank will allocate a sum of gold and distribute it equally among the eight units. However, the number of employees in each unit varies. For those with more employees, such as the two railway bureaus with more than 9,000 employees, each person can only get about one qian. For other units, such as the telecommunications bureau, each person can get about two qian. However, because it is difficult to divide, each unit plans to entrust a silver shop to melt it into a commemorative ring and then distribute it to each employee to wear. After hearing the news that the State Bank authorities agreed to exchange gold, the employees of the eight units, although they could not satisfy their desire for one tael of gold, still felt that it was better than nothing.</p>
<h3>Director Wu Came and Went in a Hurry; Discussing Technical Issues of Deposit Exchange</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The new method of depositing and exchanging gold and silver has not been announced for a long time. In order to show solemnity, the Ministry of Finance yesterday sent Wu Xingzhou, the director of the Currency Department of the Ministry, to Shanghai to discuss various technical issues of deposit exchange with the authorities of the State Bank. After arriving in Shanghai, Wu Lou met with Liu Gongyun, the vice president of the State Bank, Li Xiaozhuang, the deputy director of the Business Bureau, and Bi Delin, the director of the Gold Management Bureau, in the meeting room of the Central Bank at Wai Tan at around 10 am to conduct a discussion. It was heard that Wu inquired in detail about the past deposit exchange situation of the State Bank. As for how to improve the new deposit exchange method technically and how to prevent purchasers from re-profiting from it, although it was stated that it was not mentioned at the meeting, it is believed that there must be a detailed review for the Ministry of Finance to use as a reference when drafting the new method. The meeting yesterday did not end until around 11 am. Because it was exploratory in nature, the expectation of the outside world that the new deposit exchange method would be announced immediately after the meeting was not realized. And Director Wu also hurriedly took the opinions obtained in this meeting and returned to Beijing last night to report back.</p>
<h3>This Month's Rice Ration to Be Sold on the 6th; Rice Rations Not Received in November; Still Available for Purchase Until the 4th</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu convened the 39th Sino-American Food Conference at the City Hall yesterday. Representatives from the US Aid Application Committee, the US Economic Cooperation China Branch, the Food Department Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee, and the People's Food Allocation Office attended. After the meeting, according to the person in charge of the People's Food Allocation Office, (1) The January rice ration is now being transferred to rice shops throughout the city and will be sold from January 6th to the 31st, (2) The ration price will be approved at a three-person subgroup meeting on the 3rd and announced on the 4th, (3) Recently, there has been an accumulation of broken rice. In January, the old method will still be followed, with each certificate for 15 catties of rice, 3 catties of broken rice will be matched, and the remaining 12 catties will be whole rice. According to the news from the conference, it was decided at this meeting to suspend the allocation of rice for the December plan and postpone it until the end, and then make up for it. As for the key rice allocation in this city, it will continue to be held in January, and the allocation method will remain the same.</p>
<p>In addition, the certificates for the January ration of rice per capita were sent to the district offices at the end of last year for distribution. And it is scheduled to be issued by January 5th. All those who have registered their household registration in this city in November 37 and have obtained the national identity card of this city should receive the January rice ration certificate. If anyone has not received it within the specified period, they should go to the chief of their jia to collect it before January 8th, and no supplementary issuance will be made after the deadline. Each jia chief should submit the signed list of the jia and the remaining rice certificates to the bao office on January 9th. On the 10th, each bao will prepare a report on the distribution certificate of the bao, together with the remaining certificates and signed list returned by each jia, and submit them to the district office, and then each district office will send them to the allocation office for verification and collection on the 11th. After the citizens receive the rice ration certificate, they should fill in their ID card number, bao, jia, and household number on the certificate. Each rice shop may ask the rice purchaser to show their ID card for verification when rationing rice. In order to facilitate the purchase of rice for citizens, the office has still designated five districts, including Luwan, Songshan, Gaoqiao, Hongkou, and Jiangwan, to handle the rationing of designated rice shops in January. As for the rice rationing last year, it was heard that in several districts, because citizens concentrated on buying from certain rice shops, some rice shops were sold out. The reporter asked the allocation office about any remedies for this yesterday. According to the spokesperson, the office has replenished the few rice shops with a shortage of rice on the 30th and 31st, and as usual, each should be limited to the 31st to stop the rationing, so that each rice shop can close the account and pay the money to the tracking line the next day according to regulations. However, the next day happened to be New Year's Day, and the bank had to open for collection until the 5th. Because of this special situation, citizens who buy rice before January 4th will not affect the rice shop's payment on the morning of the 5th, and they will naturally be happy to accept it, and the rice shop will not refuse.</p>
<h3>Public and Private Teachers Receiving In-Kind Allocations; Must All Present ID Cards</h3>
<p>From January of the 38th year, employees of public and private agencies in this city should first show their national ID card or agency service certificate when receiving the allocation of in-kind goods and rice and flour allowances or exchanging the difference in order to be cautious.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] From the figures of industrial electricity consumption, a review of the industrial production of each month in the 37th year reveals that, apart from November when Shanghai Power Company's machinery was continuously damaged, leading to a sharp reduction in electricity supply, the rest generally remained stable. In this city, over 87% of industrial electricity is supplied by the American-owned Shanghai Power Company. Therefore, the company's industrial electricity consumption statistics are sufficient to reflect the general situation of this city's industry. In January last year, the company's industrial electricity consumption was approximately 52 million kilowatt-hours, with 29 million kilowatt-hours used by the textile industry. In February, electricity consumption decreased to 43 million kilowatt-hours, with the textile industry decreasing to 24 million kilowatt-hours. In March, it rebounded to 51 million kilowatt-hours, with 29 million kilowatt-hours used by the textile industry. In April, electricity consumption was 53 million kilowatt-hours, with the textile industry accounting for over 28 million kilowatt-hours. In May, industrial electricity consumption fell back to 48 million kilowatt-hours, with the textile industry accounting for 15 million kilowatt-hours. In June, the electricity consumption figure was slightly less than 50 million kilowatt-hours, with the textile industry around 26 million kilowatt-hours. Furthermore, electricity consumption in July was 48 million kilowatt-hours, in August it was 47 million kilowatt-hours, in September it was 46 million kilowatt-hours, and in October it was 48 million kilowatt-hours, all without significant discrepancies. In November, due to machinery damage at the power plant and massive extraction of electricity, industrial production declined. However, this was an abnormal phenomenon and not due to the shrinking of the industry itself, a point that should not be misunderstood. In December, electricity consumption returned to its previous level, approaching that of October, and may even exceed it. Looking at the industrial consumption of each month throughout the year, April was the highest. According to industry insiders, this period is the peak month for industry because the climate is mild, neither cold nor hot, and workers are in high spirits, resulting in particularly high production rates, hence the higher electricity consumption. September and October in autumn are also normally good months, but this year, due to the harm of rigid price controls, industrial electricity consumption increased.</p>

<h3>Attempted Assassination of Legislator Case Opens: Defendant Confesses Hidden Facts; Paternal Great-Uncle Raped His Wife; Firing to Vent Anger; Plaintiff Claims it was a Pretext for Borrowing Money</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Judge Meng Tingke of the District Court opened the trial yesterday afternoon on the case of the attempted assassination of legislator Zhang Erling by a certain grand-nephew Zhang Guangfu, resulting in an order for a retrial on another date. According to the defendant's confession, the inside story is a blood case caused by a love triangle. Zhang Guangfu, of Guangxi origin, brought his wife from Guangxi to Beijing in September last year, living with his paternal great-uncle (currently a Guangxi legislator) Zhang Erling. On November 11th this year, Nanjing was evacuating the population. Guangfu and his wife came to Shanghai, took a boat to Wuhan, and transferred via the Yuehan Railway to return to their Guangxi hometown. On the way to Wuhan, when Guangfu was holding his son while he urinated, his wife was deeply moved and, feeling a pang of conscience, told her husband that she had been repeatedly raped by her great-uncle Erling in February this year. She also wrote a letter to her elder sister (Guangfu's sister-in-law), stating that Erling had asked her to introduce her elder sister to him, to make good things happen, urging her elder sister to be careful and not to follow in her footsteps, falling into Erling's trap. She asked her husband to take the letter to her elder sister in Beijing. Upon hearing this, Guangfu was filled with anger. After sending his wife back to their hometown, he wrote a paper exposing Erling's crimes, which was over six thousand words long. Together with the letter given to him by his wife, he took a train back to Hengyang and, for a price of over ten thousand yuan, bought an airplane ticket and returned to Beijing and Shanghai. On December 5th, Guangfu went to Zhang Erling's home at 1777 Linsen Middle Road in this city, presented the charges and the letter he had brought with him. During their conversation, an argument broke out. Erling's wife, Wu Shuying, heard the noise and came downstairs. Initially, she scolded Erling for his improper behavior, and then the couple began to argue with each other. They then turned their anger on Guangfu. Shuying cursed Guangfu as a "turtle son-of-a-bitch," and demanded that Guangfu leave immediately, or she would kill him. In a fit of anger, Guangfu raised his own pistol and fired four times in a row, injuring Erling in the left armpit. Shuying stepped forward to stop him, and her left wrist was also slightly injured. After reporting to the police, the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, and Guangfu was prosecuted for attempted murder. The District Court opened the trial yesterday afternoon and brought up Guangfu, who confessed:</p>
<p>He is 29 years old this year. Erling is his great-uncle outside of the five degrees of mourning. Since the 31st year, he has been helping Erling run the Housheng Company, doing native product business, and serving as a manager, etc., until now. This November, he also assisted Erling in traveling around to do gold bar business, which generated a lot of income. He also said: I sincerely helped him run his business, but he raped my wife, which caused me great pain. Zhang Erling and his wife Shuying both appeared in court to answer questions, denying that there was any rape and claiming that Guangfu was seeking revenge for failing to borrow money. A witness surnamed Tang said that he went to Zhang's house that day for some business and heard arguments about borrowing money in the reception room. The court ordered the collection of evidence after both parties held their own arguments, and rescheduled the retrial to January 10th. The defendant was returned to custody. The court adjourned at 12:40 PM.</p>

<h3>Huili Unexpectedly Out of Form: Air School Achieves Great Victory Last Night; Expeditionary Force to Battle Hualian Tonight</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Air Force Officer School basketball team from Zhenzhou played its third match last night against the strong team Huili in this city. There were over 500 spectators. Huili suffered a crushing defeat with a score of 28 to 50. In the first half, Huili had 12 points and Air School had 30. Air School's performance over the three consecutive nights has shown a rapid improvement. The strength of the team is impressive. The performance of the Air School was particularly good in the first half, with the five players resembling lively dragons and tigers. Zhu, Liao, and Sun stood out. Huili relied solely on Cheng Zhang for scoring, resulting in a disjointed phenomenon. In the second half, Huili's Meng Xiancheng and Wu Chengzhang were injured one after the other, and the formation became more chaotic, resulting in a defeat. Huili's performance last night was unexpectedly out of form, with too many loopholes, allowing Air School to do whatever they wanted. The details of the match are as follows:</p>
<p>The match started at 7:00 PM. After contact, Air School's Liao Xuewen made a free throw. Huili's Shang Chongyue and Air School's Sun Huanting each scored a goal. Soon, Air School took the lead with a score of 5 to 2. Huili desperately counterattacked and tied the score at 7. Wu Chengzhang scored two points to chase the score, but the opponent scored three consecutive goals and remained behind, making the score 13 to 9. Air School's momentum was still strong. Their movements were agile, and they were rampant under the basket, scoring every time they shot, leaving Huili speechless. At 20 to 9, Huili substituted Tian Fuhai for Wang Yongfang, and then the score became 28 to 12. Air School substituted Yuan Shixian for Li Fuming. At half time, Air School had 30 points and Huili had 12, which was unexpected.</p>
<p>After the break, the two teams fought again. Air School substituted Meng Xiancheng for Wei Xu. Wu Chengzhang scored a shot, and Yuan Shixian scored a free throw. Tian Fuhai broke through the basket again, and the situation changed. The official school then stopped. As expected, Liao Xuewen probed in. At this time, the two teams fought fiercely, and Huili's Meng Xiancheng injured his foot and left the field. Shang Chongyue entered to replace him, and the game entered a stalemate. After 36 to 21, the official school saw a smooth opportunity again. Xuewen and Huanting took turns scoring, gaining four consecutive goals, making the score 44 to 21. Huili lost by more than half. When time ran out, Air School defeated Huili with a score of 50 to 28, spreading the good news again.</p>
<p>(Air School) Fouls Points (Huili) Fouls Points</p>
<p>Zhu Shengyi 1 15 Tian Fuhai 2 5</p>
<p>Liao Xuewen 3 17 Shang Chongyue 0 2</p>

<h3>Jin Cheng's "Winter Scene"</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Song Lin</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 26th Airmail] Since entering winter, Xuzhou has experienced very little snow, and outbreaks of epidemics have been constantly discovered. According to statistics from the Provincial Meteorological Observatory: The amount of snowfall this winter is the least in five years. On the 22nd, the "Winter Solstice," a Siberian cold air mass invaded the country, and the temperature in various places in the upper reaches of the Yellow River dropped sharply. Heavy snow fell in the northwest, and Lanzhou was also filled with goose feathers, turning into a silver world overnight. For four or five days in a row, it was sometimes cloudy and sometimes snowy, resulting in the delay of all flights this week. New students above the junior college level in this city had their winter vacation less than two weeks after entering school. The original plan for middle and primary schools was to start their winter vacation on January 15th of next year, but today, due to the severe cold weather and limited funds for each school, with no winter coal available, they have also successively moved up the exams, and will begin their vacation at the end of this month.</p>
<p>9.9 Degrees Celsius Below Zero</p>
<p>In a climate of 9.9 degrees Celsius below zero, prices are soaring frequently. Coal is selling for 120 yuan per 100 kilograms, but it is still not easy to purchase. The poverty of the common people can be imagined. As for the general poor, they are still provided for by the annual Winter Relief Committee's fundraising and relief efforts. According to a survey of more than a month, there are 8,468 poor households in the city. However, after the final "re-examination," it was decided to target the poor who are "unable to survive without relief," initially reducing the number to 7,926 households, totaling more than 14,000 people. The Winter Relief Committee's fundraising of more than 9,500 yuan, the surplus of 15,176 yuan from the sale of Winter Relief lottery tickets, and the relief funds allocated by the province, totaling more than 30,000 yuan, have been decided to purchase flour and other supplies for distribution by district. The Northeast Volunteer Army and their families, who used to return to their hometowns from the Northwest via Beijing and Shanghai, are now returning to the Northwest one after another, with some planning to go to Xinjiang to live a wandering and difficult life. This time, the city government also raised a sum of money and materials to distribute to them, totaling 5,530 yuan in relief funds and 59 sets of cotton clothes. The work of collecting relief funds for the poor is still being carried out in various ways. Elementary school students have automatically held two days of music concerts to seek a glimmer of warmth for their suffering compatriots.</p>
<p>Grain Collection Team Sweeps Big Households Three Times</p>
<p>Since October, the winter relief work launched throughout the province, according to a spokesperson from the Department of Social Affairs, is estimated to raise 10,000 shi of grain and 100,000 yuan in relief funds throughout the province, exceeding the funds and materials raised in previous years by several times. Some counties have even completed the distribution. It is said that this is because the general public understands the importance of this work and has responded enthusiastically. However, a small number of local tyrants and evil gentry are not only stingy towards this relief work, but also repeatedly resist the payment of land tax, so that the land tax originally scheduled to be collected by the end of this year has not yet reached 90%. Especially in Lanzhou City, the situation is even more special, with only 50% collected so far. In order to complete the task, the city government has recently formed a "Grain Collection Team" to go to various districts to urge payment. Several large households, such as Che Ziquan, Zhang Zihou, and Zhang Nianzu, owe more than ten shi of grain. No matter how many times the "Grain Collection Team" "sweeps" their doors, they passively adopt a "general does not see face" approach, refusing to pay. After receiving the report, the city government has set a deadline for payment, otherwise it will ask the provincial government to severely punish them.</p>
<p>Church Bells and Dancing Shadows Lull to Sleep Together</p>
<p>Christmas on the 25th is not very popular in the Northwest. Only churches and organizations held programs such as welcoming the Holy Infant, Grand Mass, music worship evenings, and hymn concerts. Due to the winter defense curfew, the ceremony of welcoming the Holy Infant, originally scheduled to be held at midnight, was moved to dawn. On this night, in several high-class families using Christmas as a pretext, lights were bright, wines were flowing, and the magnificent church bells became their "lullaby."</p>
<h3>Allowing Qingdao Refugees into Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Jingdezhen Office, 26th] The Qingdao Municipal Government, in order to evacuate refugees to Jiangxi for resettlement, had Councilor Zhang Xiufeng of the Qingdao Municipal Government liaise with the central authorities in Nanjing to a satisfactory conclusion, and also secured the agreement of relevant Jiangxi provincial government agencies to accommodate as many as possible.  The resettlement areas are mostly in northern and eastern Jiangxi counties. A steering and settlement committee is currently being planned, and it has been decided to designate ten reclamation farms to resettle the refugees, initially with a principle of 30,000 people. 15,000 people will be handled before this year, and another 15,000 people after the new year. The resettlement expenses will be allocated by the Executive Yuan at 20 million yuan, with each family receiving ten months of public grain before production, to maintain their livelihood during the non-productive period. The soil in the resettlement areas is mostly clay, and with the irrigation of the Xiu River and Gan River, it is very beneficial to the growth of crops.</p>

<h3>Increasing Capital in Cash and Transferring it to the Central Bank; All Banks and Firms Complied with Orders Yesterday; Actual Amount Deposited was Only Over 20 Million</h3>
<p>Banks and firms have been ordered to comply with the increase in capital. The cash to be transferred to the Central Bank has also been paid in full as ordered. All procedures were completed yesterday. However, the cash transferred by various banks and firms was the deposit guarantee reserve that had been approved for use by the Ministry of Finance. The required deposit reserve was allowed to be offset by public bonds and treasury bills. The valuation standard for these public bonds and treasury bills has been approved: (1) US dollar treasury bills at a 1:1 ratio, (2) US dollar bonds at a 20:1 ratio, and (3) legal tender bonds discounted by 30%. Various banks and firms have sent the above-mentioned securities to the Central Bank before noon on the 31st to offset the deposit guarantee reserve. It is understood that the deposit reserve of various banks and firms in Shanghai is approximately 40 million, while the cash to be paid for the increased capital is only slightly more than 62 million. After using the offset, the actual cash deposited by various banks and firms for the increased capital was only over 20 million. Therefore, the local money market did not become unusually tight yesterday due to the increase in capital. The issue of using the increased capital in cash is being closely reviewed by the Gold Management Bureau. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, the Bureau will handle the matter in accordance with regulations. Applications can be made for any legitimate and necessary use, and the Bureau will handle them in a very simple manner for speed.

<h3>Tea Market Transactions Become Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market saw transactions decline significantly. Green tea was affected because the Gregorian New Year's Eve had already arrived, and the money market on the market remained tight. Daily interest rates again reached more than 40 yuan per thousand. At the same time, because various financial instruments and commodities consistently fell sharply on the day before, buyers were also pessimistic about red and green tea and were unwilling to rush to buy. Appetite became narrow. However, because tea stocks were dry and depleted, and production costs were still difficult to suppress, sellers' attitudes remained firm. Prices were able to hold steady, and the market situation was no different from before.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Trend Calm</h3>

Customs duty would add interest accordingly.</p>
<h3>Overcoat Fabrics Downstream</h3>
<p>The overcoat fabric market gradually trended downstream yesterday. There were few buyers. Because the time was late, everyone wanted to sell, so sellers lacked the strength to support the price.

<h3>This Year, China's Barter Trade Focuses on the Nanyang Sterling Bloc; Person in Charge of the China Trust Bureau Points Out Three Advantages</h3>
<p>According to the China Trust Bureau, the Bureau has learned from past barter trade with countries such as France and Italy that China can export very few types of goods, and the goods obtained through barter are not sufficient for China's needs. Therefore, the target of barter trade for this (38th) year will focus on the Sterling Bloc in the Nanyang region. A spokesperson pointed out that the degree of industrial development in the Nanyang region is not superior to that of China. China's industrial products such as silk textiles and enamel hot water bottles can all be exported. At the same time, industrial raw materials such as cotton and rubber can be imported from the Nanyang region, which will help China's industrial recovery. It is evidenced by the fact that China did not engage in barter trade with the Nanyang Sterling Bloc last year, so various raw materials such as cotton could not be obtained in large quantities. Moreover, foreign trade in various states of the Nanyang Sterling Bloc mostly uses barter as a means. To obtain their materials, it is necessary to exchange. Given China's proximity to Nanyang, once barter trade is launched, its advantages are: (1) There are many overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Sterling Bloc, which greatly helps the promotion of Chinese goods, thereby establishing the position of Chinese goods in Nanyang. (2) Qi, the items most needed by China, are all produced in Nanyang. The types and quantities of Chinese industrial and agricultural products needed in Nanyang are also more numerous than in other countries. In this way, exports can be increased, which is beneficial to both parties. (3) Strengthening trade ties with the Sterling Bloc can alleviate China's lack of US dollar foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>Farmers Bank Will Directly Exchange 10,000 Tons of Fertilizer for Rice from Farmers</h3>
<p>One Jin of Fertilizer Exchanged for Two Jin of Net Rice</p>
<p>The Trust Department of the Farmers Bank of China, in order to promote chemical fertilizer and increase agricultural production, has reached an agreement with the US Economic Cooperation Administration to allocate approximately 10,000 tons of the fertilizer supplied to China to the bank's agricultural lending institutions in various locations to directly exchange rice with farmers. The method is set as one Jin of fertilizer exchanged for two Jin of net rice from farmers.

The exchange ratio is approximately a 3:1 ratio. The fertilizer is all ammonium sulfate, which is extremely effective in increasing production, so the farmers will benefit greatly, and the acres of farmland that will benefit in the future will be considerable.</p>
<p>It is understood that the first batch of fertilizer totals 10,420 metric tons and is all Elephant Mark and Money Mark ammonium sulfate. Among them, 4,513 metric tons ordered in the United Kingdom will be shipped from London to Shanghai on January 10, 38.

<h3>New Year's Panorama</h3>
<p>Reflections on New Year's Day in the Past</p>
<p>In ancient times, there were various customs for the New Year. The *Chronicle of the Seasons of Jingchu* states: "On the first day of the first month, young and old all put on their best attire and pay New Year's greetings in order of seniority, offering peppercorn wine and drinking peach soup, and then drinking Tusu wine, chewing dates, and partaking of the five pungent herbs." It also states: "On New Year's Day, pictures of chickens are pasted on doors, Dongsuo ropes are hung above them, and talismans are inserted beside them, which frightens away all ghosts." Nowadays, these old customs are mostly no longer practiced and are only cited as historical facts in poetry and prose.</p>
<p>Turning through the copies of this newspaper from the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty, there is a passage that states: "The first day of the first month is New Year's Day, and there are ceremonies such as celebrations and greetings. From the emperor to the common people; from the court to the villages, none are exempt. Although it is impossible to verify before the Xia and Shang dynasties, this custom was already practiced in the Zhou dynasty. From the Han dynasty to today, this custom has been passed down and has not been changed. During the Han dynasty, on New Year's Day, officials at court would offer peppercorn wine to the emperor during New Year's greetings to wish him longevity. Now, there are still New Year's greetings, but without the offering of wine. Inside, princes and high officials offer New Year's greetings in palaces and halls; outside, high-ranking officials of the borders, as well as prefectural and county officials, celebrate each other in their respective jurisdictions. After offering sacrifices to ancestors, common people also drink Tusu wine. Those of lower status first respect those of higher status, and the young first respect the old, drinking in succession until the youngest. Now, there is no longer a custom of drinking Tusu wine in turn, but the ritual of celebrating New Year's Day remains. After family rituals are completed, they visit relatives, friends, colleagues, and neighbors to offer New Year's greetings, which is commonly known as 'paying New Year's respects.' According to Chinese regulations, civil and military officials seal their official seals for one month during the New Year, allowing them to take a break from work. Unless there are urgent matters, everything can be postponed until after the seals are reopened. Sealing the seals is scheduled for the 20th day of the twelfth month, and reopening the seals is scheduled for the 20th day of the first month. There may be minor variations, but the difference is no more than a day or so. After the seals are reopened, officials resume their duties as usual, and the New Year festivities are over."</p>
<p>Remembering the Past with Spring Couplets</p>
<p>Old Spring couplets used to say things like "The New Year ushers in abundant blessings, the auspicious festival is called eternal spring," or "The emperor's virtue is as vast as the universe, the imperial grace is as deep as rain and dew." In the early years of the Republic of China, the couplet "Pursue republican happiness, act as free citizens" was popular. After sixteen years, it became "Overthrow imperialism, abolish unequal treaties."</p>
<p>Writing Auspicious Phrases on Red Paper on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Writing auspicious phrases on red paper on New Year's Day was also an old custom. A strip of red paper would be pasted on the wall in the study, with the eight characters "Write auspicious phrases on New Year's Day, may everything go smoothly" written on it. The characters had to be in regular script, written meticulously, and very proper. This paper would be replaced every New Year's Day, simply to bring good luck.</p>
<p>Lanterns for the Lantern Festival</p>
<p>The lanterns for the Lantern Festival are made of paper, some light yellow and some bright red, with various images painted on them, or with gold characters and gold foil pasted on them, making them very splendid. They are mostly flat and round in shape. These are supposed to be decorations for the Lantern Festival in the middle of the first month, but they are already sold in the market before New Year's Eve. "Lantern Festival" is also written as "Top Scholar," presumably wishing for good fortune. Children welcome these the most. With a slight change in style, they become lion lanterns, rabbit lanterns, and so on, which are the most popular New Year's toys.</p>
<p>The First Solar New Year's Day</p>
<p>Thirty-seven years ago today, Chen Qimei, the head of the Shanghai Military Government, issued a proclamation:</p>
<p>"For the matter of issuing a proclamation: Today (the twelfth day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar), we received an order from President Sun, designating the thirteenth day of this month as Solar New Year's Day. Our Republic of China is undergoing comprehensive reform and should promptly adopt the solar calendar in order to advance civilization alongside the world's great powers, thus refreshing both eyes and ears. Therefore, we hereby proclaim this to the military and the people. Let all military personnel be informed: The thirteenth day of the eleventh month of the 4609th year of the Yellow Emperor's reign is hereby changed to the first day of the first month of the first year of the Republic of China. The lunar calendar, which was previously used, is hereby completely changed. President Sun will assume office and issue orders on New Year's Day of the first year, making a fresh start with the world. This proclamation is hereby urgently issued to inform everyone. Starting tomorrow, all sectors should uniformly hang the national flag to celebrate the grand event. This is a special proclamation!"</p>
<p>The Founding Father's Oath on New Year's Day</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM on New Year's Day of the first year of the Republic of China, the Founding Father arrived at the Marshal's Mansion in a two-horse carriage. He was led into the lounge by the martyr Huang Xing, and then ascended to the presidential office in the grand auditorium. Xu Shaozhen served as the master of ceremonies. The Founding Father swore an oath, which read: "To overthrow the autocratic government of the Manchus, consolidate the Republic of China, and seek democratic happiness, is the public will of the people. I, Wen, will faithfully abide by it and serve the country with utmost loyalty. When the autocratic government has fallen, there is no internal strife, and the Republic of China stands firmly in the world and is recognized by all nations, I, Wen, shall relinquish the position of Provisional President. I hereby swear this to the people. Sun Wen, New Year's Day of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>New Year's Day for Americans</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, Americans mostly put on fashionable clothes and go out for parades, holding flower paper and throwing it at anyone. Some also bring musical instruments and play them to their hearts' content in the streets. As for those who have girlfriends, they often walk hand in hand, whispering sweet nothings. In big cities, at night, people sing and dance in the streets to welcome the New Year. At midnight, the bells in the churches ring in unison. They make noise until four or five in the morning before returning home, having had their fill of fun.</p>
<p>New Year's Day for the Japanese</p>
<p>On New Year's Day, the Japanese must place two pine trees at the entrance, tied together with bamboo and plum blossoms. The door frame is also made of twisted rice straw, with an orange placed in the middle, and some white paper strips pasted on it, so that demons dare not invade. Before dawn, everyone in the family gets up and climbs to a high place to watch the sunrise, silently wishing for good luck in the year, like the rising sun. After returning home, they stand facing east, and everyone must drink a sip of wine, which is said to ward off evil spirits.</p>
<p>Devil-expelling Rituals</p>
<p>Lamas perform rituals of devil-expulsion during the New Year. Wearing masks in the shape of demons, they sing and dance to the accompaniment of the *Hujia*, its sound mournful, said to drive away evil. The natives of South America also have this custom during the New Year, called the "Gods' Assembly," where participants wear masks and jump and dance for joy. The gods they worship vary in size, the larger ones being up to ten feet tall, and the smaller ones only two or three feet.</p>
<p>New Year's Cards</p>
<p>Since the invention of New Year's cards in 1875, the craze among American women for sending New Year's cards has grown year by year. In 1942, a total of 1.2 billion New Year's cards were sold in the United States, and the postage cost more than 60 million US dollars.</p>
