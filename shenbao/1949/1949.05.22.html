<h3>陸海空密切配合作戰　浦東高橋國軍奏捷　共軍損失重攻勢被遏制</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方廿一日十時五十分消息：匪部昨日以四個精銳軍兵力，進犯我浦東高橋陣地，以我陸海空軍將士聯合猛擊，衝鋒肉搏，發揮最大威力，匪傷亡達一萬二千五百餘人，遺屍遍野，并繳獲輕重機槍一百五十餘挺，生俘一千五百餘人，匪部陣容異常慌亂，攻勢漸　，現激戰仍在進行中。</p>

<h3>李代總統發表文告　闡明政府應戰目的　希望全國一致合作達成自救救國任務</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州廿日電〕李代總統廿日發表告全國同胞書，全文如次：</p>
<p>全國同胞們！在四個月以前，政府為不忍使國家人民繼續遭受戰爭的慘禍，爰順從全國人民一致渴望生平的意旨，決心倡導和平，宗仁亦會一再表示願以最高之誠意，個人不惜犧牲一切，以期和平之實現，不料這一切抒誠相見的表示，和委曲求全的苦心，結果均付之流水。由於中共始終不肯放棄其以武力征服全國的企圖，提出了苛刻萬分使政府無法接受的所謂「國內和平協定」，同時在政府覆電請其重新考慮的時候，即悍然不顧，下令總攻，強渡長江，於是全國同胞所殷切期望的和談，遂致無法繼續而終於破裂，戰火重復蔓延擴展。這一次和談破裂與繼續戰爭的責任，究竟誰屬，誰無誠意求取和平，誰使人民重罹戰禍之慘，這一切的一切，全國乃至全世界的人，都可根據鐵一般的事實，作公正的評判，我在此不顧多加說明。但是有一點，我要請全國同胞認識清楚的，即是中國共產黨由於他的國際背景，與他的基本精神所決定，他們必須要以暴力消滅一切非共產黨的力量，必須要以暴力來統治全中國的人民，要摧毀中國數千年來優良傳統的文化與道德，他們不僅是毫無憐惜，要驅使全中國的人民，在今天內戰當中犧牲，而且在將來的國際戰爭中，也將使我們的國家與人民。為共產國際去效忠効死，他們此次所提出的所謂「國內和平協定」，便是充滿了這個精神，充分的暴露了他們的陰謀毒計，也就是說明了他們所謂「解放」工作的內容。同胞們！試問我們是否需要這樣的「解放」，是否應該拿我們的生命與國家，去為另一個國際集團去犧牲，跟着人家去走上殘亡之路，如其不然，我們對這一個暴力的壓迫，便不能不予以抵抗，因為我們要生存，要自由，要民主，要維護我們國家的獨立，政府今天便是基於這一個目的而應戰，全國同胞也就應該瞭解這一個意義，而作最大的努力，來與政府合作，達成自救救國的任務。</p>
<p>誰也知道，戰爭是最殘酷的，而且在對內對外戰爭連續了十餘年之後，民窮財盡，國家元氣大傷，政府決不能忍心非從事戰爭不可，我個人過去也認定兄弟　墻之爭，應該可以用政治方式解決，沒有必以兵戎相見的理由，這是我主張和平的基本觀念。但是中共不僅沒有和平的誠意，而且也不祗是工政府向他們投降，還要全國人民向他們投降，要全中國的人民放在中共暴力統治之下。今天在所謂「解放區」中所表現的事實，更足以證明他們的殘酷與虛偽，若干「解放區」裏的人民和青年，都逃到政府區域裏來，若干貧苦的農工群眾，在他們所謂「參軍」「獻糧」的號召之下，被迫着去當炮灰，被榨取得乾乾淨淨，若干的青年無書可讀，若干他們所標榜的「民主人士」，在嚴格的監視之下，變成了御用品，總之，今天在「解放區」裏的人民，不僅生活上沒有自由，就是思想與精神上，也時時刻刻受着重大的壓迫與恐怖。再如此次和談中，中共之所以故意提出最苛刻的條件，同時毫不考慮我們的答覆如何，但即刻開始渡江，惟恐還有一點斡旋的餘地，使他們陰謀不得逞，這些事實，就是說明了中共決心殘民以逞，來完成他以武力徵服全中國，暴力統治全中國的企圖。因此，在今天我要正告全國同胞們，我站在政府的立場，以及我對國家人民的責任感，我不能在我們手中，將國家獨立自主的主權去犧牲，我不能將全國同胞自由生存的權利去葬送，所以明知道戰爭的延續會加重人民的痛苦，但為抗拒這個暴力的壓迫與摧殘，便不能不忍痛來以戰爭終止戰爭。我希望全國同胞，要進一步的了解，如果我們不能忍受目前的痛苦，共同努力來抗拒中共的暴力，則將來在生活與精神上所受到的痛苦，必將千倍百倍於今日。現在所謂「解放區」裡面同胞所遭受的一切，但是很好的例證。</p>
<p>其次，中共曾公開宣誓，在下一次的世界戰爭中，他們將與蘇聯併肩作戰，這無異在第三次世界戰爭尚未爆發之前，即已由中共將我們全國同胞的生命財產，預先簽訂為人家去犧牲的賣身契，這是我們每一個有國家民族觀念的所決不能容忍的。過去政府接受了美國物資援助，中共一再指責我們是賣國政府，諸位同胞，大家試想，究竟是誰甘心賣國？如果說接受美援便是賣國，則在第二次世界大戰中，那一個國家不接受美援，那不豈不都成了賣國政府嗎？戰後蘇聯及其他各國，也曾向美國要求援助，為甚麼中共又不指責蘇聯為賣國？為甚麼其他各國人民也沒有指責他本國政府為賣國？同胞們！我們再想一想，究竟是接受以平等待我的美國援助為賣國，還是犧牲我國家的獨立自主，去接受共產國際的領導，要將我們的國家與人民為共產國際去効忠効死為賣國。我們要知道，今天中國共產黨是以另一個國家為他們的祖國，他們以另一個國家的國旗作為中國的國旗，所以他們才是喪心病狂的說出要與蘇聯併肩作戰的話，這是凡有國家民族觀念的人所不忍聞的。同胞們！我們更要知道，中共之所以反對美援，是有意加深中國人民的貧困，要在全中國的貧困飢餓中，來發展共產主義的勢力，所以才不惜犧牲我們的國家與人民，去達成他們所謂世界革命的目的。各位同胞！試問我們是否需要這樣的革命，這一革命如果獲得成功，也許中國人民的生命將有二分之一會被犧牲，中國的國家將完全變為另一個國家的附庸，這一個強暴力量的繼續發展，必然會使東南亞乃至全世界的受到威脅。因此，我們為着保障國家獨立，與人民生存，以及世界和平，也不得不為抗拒中共的暴力而戰。</p>
<p>總之，同胞們！我們應該要認識清楚，今天這一個戰爭，我們決不是為政府而戰，而是為人民而戰，為國家而戰，決不是為少數人的利益而戰，而是為全國人民爭取生存與自由而戰，不是為某一黨一派而戰，而是為國家爭取獨立而戰。目前政府的軍事形勢，無疑是相當惡劣，但是我以為如果我們全國同胞能對現實與將來，順逆與禍福，有正確認識與辨別，瞭然於中共禍國殃民的陰謀，則軍事形勢的逆轉，以及一切艱難困苦，都無須過慮。因為在歷史上，惟有正義乃可戰勝武力，迷信武力的終必失敗。在此，我可以負責的告訴全國同胞，從今天以後，我所領導的政府，對於抵抗這個暴力的壓迫，具有堅強的決心，雖至一兵一卒，亦決不放棄我們的責任，同時并要排除任何阻力，來從事政治，經濟，軍事各方面的革新，務必使政府一切措施能適應時代的需要，與人民的要求，以期嚴整政府陣容，充實政府力量，來從事於維護國家與人民利益的反共戰爭。切盼我們全國同胞能認清這個戰爭的意義與目的，為着自救救國，都要自發自動的盡力來協助政府，共同努力於這一個反暴力反欺騙反極權反恐怖反侵略的戰爭，在廣大群眾的支持之下，我相信必然可以獲得最後的勝利，中華民國萬歲。</p>

<h3>主力盡失眾叛親離　吳化文在浦東　被其部屬扣留</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕軍方確息，吳逆化文於濟南戰役中率部叛變後，甘心賣身投靠共匪，此次匪等渡江，吳逆曾被驅作前鋒，在每次人海戰術中充當肉彈，其所部始終在共匪監視控制中，被迫參加作戰，渡江後即被調至滬郊，在浦東方面流竄，連日經國軍陸空協力搜剿轟炸，主力損失殆盡，殘部已無鬥志，吳逆在眾判親離中，仍須執行共方命令，驅部送死，頃據匪俘供稱，吳逆在魯中叛變時，係為共軍以若干金條所收買，其左右重要僚屬咸示不滿，時出怨言，日前經在浦東某地將吳逆扣留，并令其將共方金條交出。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕海軍第一艦隊某部，昨日下午四時於吳淞口外東庫·楊家柵·天主堂一帶江面，秦砲擊進犯高橋之共軍，獲得奇果。據地面部隊報告，東庫·楊家柵·天主堂一帶共軍，因受海軍軍艦猛烈砲擊，自各綫紛向國軍投誠者共達千餘人，傷亡在五百人以上。海軍昨日下午配合地面部隊作戰，達三小時之久，海軍總司令桂永清將軍，第一艦隊司令馬紀壯將軍及劉廣凱艦長，乘旗艦親往前綫指揮，桂總司令曾下令所乘旗艦駛近浦東共軍陣地二千公尺處，以共軍最畏懼之四十糎機關砲密集射擊，記者自望遠鏡中眼見共軍據點十餘處均被擊毀起火。當時除地面部隊與共軍發生陣地戰外，空軍并出動轟炸機三架，指示海軍射擊目標，并行轟射，東庫江岸濃煙蔽天。不少國軍憑藉背水工事，阻擊共軍之種種活動，崇明島漁民張網捕魚，及距離火綫十餘華里以外之農舍漁家與阡陌行人，均能於旗艦中看出。桂氏暨馬司令等高級海軍將領多人，并於旗艦中以無綫電指揮其他軍艦作戰，艦上射擊士兵沉着，細心而不苟。桂氏語記者，現有海軍士兵官佐之戰鬥意志極強，自南京撤退後，海軍已凝成一堅強無隙之堡壘，渠相信浦東出擊勝利，上海最少更可安定三個月。桂將軍認為匪軍實際上之困難亦多，渠以為吾人應以意志第一，堅強之意志配合大砲，必可收勝利之成果。</p>

<h3>社論　鎮靜第一　秩序第一</h3>
<p>戰火愈迫近上海，街頭　就更充滿了戰時景象，最顯著的莫過於人心恐慌與避難者的東奔西走，不僅郊區的人民向市區搬移，就是在市區的人民，也紛紛向着他所憧憬着的安全地區搬移，大家都以為另處終比自己的安全。這是幻覺的存在，不僅要增加市民心理上的恐慌，而且也要增加市民物質上的損失；我們站在輿論界的立場，不得不向全市六百萬市民高呼「鎮靜第一」的口號，這種惶惶然不可終日的情形，徒然增加社會的危險而已，老實說：在今日的上海，命運相共，地區不分東南西北，反正都是一樣的，五十步與百步，究底有什麼差別呢！</p>
<p>論理，獲得安全，不遭危險，是人生基本的需要；它的需要，仔細想想，實比吃飯更迫切，吃飯目的在維持生命，一旦忽略安全，危險　臨，生命喪失於片刻，單講吃飯有什麼用處，安全直接與生命有關，西洋人所倡的「安全第一」，殊可玩味的。</p>
<p>世界變遷，安全問題的本質也隨之變遷，往昔許多的危險如洪水猛獸的溺人吃人，現今已成陳迹；在另一面，近代的文化和機器的時代帶來了一種簇新的更嚴重的危險。生活增多緊張，城市增加擁擠，人民和事物雙方增添流動性，遂產生了以前所沒有的危險。汽車肇禍是一件最顯著的例，美國每年做汽車輪下鬼的，總要二三萬，據統計報告，近來死得頂少的年頭是一九二三年，但也要撞死一八，四〇〇人，一九四一年為三九，九六九，一九四九年為二八，〇七六，其中死亡的都屬年青人，十五到廿四歲間的佔百分之五十二。第一次世界大戰，美國死亡士卒三十萬，同時被汽車軋死的三十二萬五千，差不多每十八分鐘死一人！美國總計各種意外傷害年死約十萬人，最近十二年共死百萬以上，重傷者二千五百萬，損失至少四〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇金元。</p>
<p>今日文明各國死亡率最高死亡原因中佔第一位的倒不是疾病而是意外傷害。美國男性三歲與三十八歲間，女姓三歲至二十一歲間因意外傷害而死亡的比任何病疫為多。平時如此，戰時益甚，上海的四郊砲火連天，以古老頭腦的人民包圍於新式武器的狹小戰鬥場裏，其危險性實在不可想像。十六日空軍機羣，飛往前綫掠過市空時，突有一機急飛失慎，致炸彈受震墮落一枚於塘山路，十八日中興輪開赴台灣時，碼頭秩序紊亂，有不買票登輪者，有臨時在船邊買黑市票，上不到船的，到後來，拔去跳板，人從船上用繩吊上去，此情此景危險性是何等的大。這幾天浦東和郊外逃難的市民深夜經過河浜，前推　軋，擁擠不堪，無往而不可致人死命。時時有逃命送命之虞。</p>
<p>上海市民邇來如坐火藥庫中，心理不免失常，風聲鶴唳，草木皆兵，幻想中亦會無中生有，神經緊張，來一點小刺戟就起大反應，謠言一起，不問青紅皂白，輕信為真。前天十六舖略聞槍聲，以為出了亂子，商店紛紛打烊，行人和車夫們驚慌得四散奔走，各盡最大的氣力，向後飛馳，馬路上亂作一團，行人們一面逃，一面又向人探詢，究竟出了什麼事？但誰也回答不出到底是什麼一回事，然而大家都盲目地隨從別人跟着狼狽地亂跑，整個南市陷入了騷動狀態中，原來沒什麼事，只是浦江守軍鳴槍禁船攏岸。這情形彷彿「一犬吠影，百犬吠聲。」天下本無事，庸人自擾之，可是危險性卻埋伏這亂的場面下。</p>
<p>記得「八一三」之役，十一月七日晚，謠傳浦東失守，民眾夜間爭先渡江，溺斃者不可勝數。十一月九日，楓林橋失陷，濱內屍體纍纍，孩子們面染殷碧的血跡含着母親的僵癟乳頭，倒在岸邊的為數亦不少。戰前上海租界不是安樂窩嗎？可是公共租界有這樣的驚人報告：「自八月十三日至十月十二日止，這二個月中，上海公共租界裏中流彈死亡的非戰鬥員（即市民）二千零五十七人，外籍人士三十六人，此次死亡數較「一二八」時死亡的七十一人，受傷的一百十六人，此次死亡數較「一二八」時多三十三倍。傷亡未報巡捕房的不在其例。」前事不忘後事之師。</p>
<p>要之，在此戰亂危難之際，唯有力持鎮靜，出以不變應萬變的精神，始能轉危為安，我們以此向上海地六百萬市民呼籲，同時，更希望警察當局能以「維持秩序」為天職，以全力維持上海的秩序。</p>

<h3>四强外長會議明日揭幕　艾契遜飛抵巴黎　在法外部與貝文許曼會商共同立場　維辛斯基一行離莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿一日廣播：美國務卿艾文契遜英外相貝文與法外長許曼今日在法外部會談約十五分鐘，商討出席四强會議應采共同立場。蘇外長維辛斯基已於今日離莫斯科飛巴黎。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎廿一日電〕美國務卿艾契遜，乘總統專機「獨立」號，於今晨九時零三分飛機抵此間奧萊機場，俾出席廿三日開幕之四强外長會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二十日電〕英外相貝文今日自倫敦抵此，渠將於外長會議揭幕前，與艾契遜及許曼批準三國外交專家本週內秘密擬具的三强在外長會議中的共同政策。消息靈通方面謂西方三强的意見，現已幾乎趨於一致，預料蘇外長維辛斯基將就下列諸點，面臨三强的一致立場，卽（一）不使蘇聯參加魯爾的管制；（二）保持西德國，（三）決不放棄援助德國。此間蘇聯大使館尚不知維辛斯基可於何時抵達，莫斯科來報告則謂，維氏攜有德國問題專家·政治顧問·及秘書共計七十人之多。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎二十日電〕外交界人士今日聲稱，蘇聯外長維辛斯基諒將於四外長會議之初，披露蘇聯領袖人物之近有更動，是否表示蘇方政策有重大改變。蘇聯領袖人物最近大事更迭，維辛斯基遂繼莫洛托夫出掌外交。預料外長會議週一在此間開幕後，維辛斯基行將發表之言論中，即可對蘇聯領袖人物更迭之意義，供給線索。西方盟國認為蘇聯政策若有任何變更，將向較佳方面轉變，故西方外交家均將觀察蘇聯欲終止其阻礙策略之徵象。過去廿四小時內，蘇聯發表兩項重要宣佈，顯係為外長會議作準備：（一）英美在紐約聯大會中向蘇代表團建議解決希臘內戰，蘇代表葛羅米柯即建議一項可能的解決方案。（二）蘇聯擬將剩餘日戰俘全部遣返日本。眾認蘇方此兩項宣佈，乃蘇聯和平攻勢中之行動，此兩問題殊少在外長會議中提付討論之機會，蓋此次會議之召開，乃專門討論德國問題者，但或將就希臘局勢作非正式談話。英美法三國副代表已擬就關於德國問題之完善計劃，應付維辛斯基。據各方表示外長會議成功之機會，唯蘇方是賴。</p>
<h3>奧地利外長正告四强　佔領狀態應結束　奧和約問題不容拖延不決</h3>
<p>〔路透社維也納廿一日電〕奧外長葛魯勃昨向奧人民黨大會發表演說稱，四强在本屆外長會議中如不能解決奧國問題，奧國必要時將拒絕給付任何佔領費。奧國并將聲明奧國問題，已不復為國際會議討論的題目，然後立卽開始組織聯邦陸軍，使佔領狀態為之結束。</p>
<p>渠强調聲稱，吾人必須正告諸强，目前此一以解放為煙幕的佔領狀態必須結束，吾人同時亦須昭示諸强，奧國人民的忍耐能力業已耗盡。今後奥人民將采取更活躍的政策，使奧國本身的利益，佔在盟國政府要求與命令之先。如四强拒不在巴黎外長會中討論奧國問題，并拒不承認奧國有建軍及要求終止佔領狀態之權，奧將向聯合國控訴該拒絕之强國對奧具有侵略行動。</p>
<h3>真理報論評</h3>
<p>四强外長會議成敗　端視西方態度為斷</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿日電〕「真理報」今日發表，抨擊英美法三國之態度，為不能對德國問題獲得協議之原因。繼謂，德國之分裂，已形成歐洲之分裂。但西方各國之分裂政策，彼等之拒絕與蘇聯合作，且放棄波茨坦所獲之計劃，反促成全世界贊成和平及反戰運動之發展。四國之協議使外長會議得以重開，而能對各基本之德國問題再度會商，但此種會商之成敗，將視西方各國所取之立場而定。</p>
<h3>西柏林鐵路工人　發生罷工潮</h3>
<p>要求以西德馬克給付工資</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿一日電〕西柏林鐵路工人一萬二千名昨午夜起開始罷工，反對蘇聯控制之鐵路管理局，西柏林鐵路運輸綫亦因而受阻。鐵路局派出武裝隊伍干涉工潮，與反共派罷工工人發生衝突，高架鐵路客車一列在混戰中被焚燬。西柏林政府宣布，西德警察將彈壓蘇軍區共產份子進一步干涉工潮，聞已有共產份子對罷工者表示同情，認為工人要求工資發給西德馬克，（價值較東德馬克高四倍）頗為合理。同時，路局已命西德貨車在波茨坦卸貨，再由卡車轉運柏林。蘇軍貨車亦在柏林市外卸貨轉運。</p>
<h3>德境經濟合作　四國談判順利</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林二十日電〕德境四國經濟合作談判，今日較前數日為順利。會議在卡爾旭斯特蘇軍總部舉行，據英方發言人稱，會中對於改組東德與西德貿易已有頭緒。</p>
<h3>希臘終止內戰唯一條件　判軍須放下武器　官方對蘇建議態度冷淡</h3>
<p>〔聯合社雅典廿日電〕希臘內閣今日召開特別閣議，討論蘇聯建議結束內戰條件，惟官方及非官方均表示冷淡。</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典二十日電〕希臘通訊社訊：希公安部長倫第斯今日表示，若要希臘獲得和平，必須由諸强包括蘇聯在內，承認希臘共產黨必須永遠不得參加希臘之政治生活。</p>
<p>諸强應該瞭解希臘遊擊隊領袖的目的，乃在了解希臘，目前彼等無限制的活動已不復可能。另據非正式方面息，希政府對遊擊隊之政策約如下述：（一）遊擊隊須無條件投降；（二）政府準備赦免能「懺悔自新」的共產黨人；（三）希共黨不能被承認亦不能參加任何選舉；（四）希政府可以考慮非共黨左翼份子的參政。英大使諾登·美代辦麥諾今夜訪外長蔡爾達理斯，通知蘇聯建議由三强談判結束希內戰之事。</p>
<p>美英法會談經過</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕蘇聯於解除柏林封鎖之後，又復向英美建議結束三年來之希臘內戰。據塔斯社消息，蘇聯已向美英兩國提出有條件解決希內戰方案，倫敦及華盛頓方面立卽發表非正式接洽經過情形。據國務院稱，此種非正式接洽，係於上月廿六日在紐約聯合國秘書長賴依宅中宴會席上開其端。及至本月四日，美國務副卿魯斯克及英外次麥克尼爾復應蘇外次葛羅米柯之邀前往晤談，上星期六又在聯大會續談。</p>
<p>蘇聯提解決方案</p>
<p>葛氏曾提出數項條件：（一）各國對希臘停止一切軍事援助。（二）關係各國監督希臘重新選舉，蘇聯亦願參加監督事宜。（三）關係各國組織監察團管理希臘北部邊疆。葛氏并轉達游擊隊所提條件：（一）下令停戰；（二）實行大赦；（三）重新選舉。魯斯克當時向葛氏答稱，問題之癥結在希臘隣國非法接濟判軍，聯合國機構實為討論此問題之正式場所。據英外部稱，當時麥克尼爾亦曾告葛氏，希臘北隣各國如停止援助希判軍，則戰事卽可停止。經過數次談話後，葛氏卽遄返莫斯科向政府請示。</p>
<p>美尊重雅典意見</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕英美今日正式通知蘇聯，若不與雅典當局充份交換意見，英美不擬開始結束希臘內戰的談判。同時美國務院已向蘇聲明，美國將繼續援助希臘政府自衛以抗侵略，由於美國認為希臘問題之討論，必須得充份徵求希政府之意見，故美國不能同意在下屆外長會議中討論希臘問題。</p>
<h3>雅典大主教逝世</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典二十日電〕雅典大主教兼希臘正教教宗達瑪斯基諾斯，今日在郊區寓所患心臟病逝世。主教在一九四四年希臘革命後，曾任希臘總督之職。</p>
<h3>狄托演說　譴責蘇聯</h3>
<p>希望矯正已往錯誤</p>
<p>〔路透社貝爾格勒二十日電〕狄托元帥今日在此間向其共產黨衛隊師發表演說，述及南斯拉夫與東方集團的關係時，謂目前緊張關係的造成，應由蘇聯負責。蘇聯應知渠已造成錯誤，故應設法加以彌補。狄托又曰，我們的地位并不壞，我們的目標在建立社會主義。</p>
<h3>美目前不擬考慮　締太平洋公約</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二十日電〕「紐約時報」今日社論稱，國務卿艾契遜明白表示政府目前不擬考慮依照大西洋條約路線，締結太平洋條約。太平洋區域政治性質不同，誠為事實，倘若太平洋條約不能締結，亦應籌劃其他措施及采取其他步驟，以堅守美國之地位。吾人避免并阻止成立太平洋條約之任何嘗試，不應妨碍吾人抵抗共產主義擴張之一貫主張</p>
<h3>世界最大博覽會　在巴黎揭幕</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎二十日電〕自明日起，世界最大之博覽會將在巴黎揭幕。參加者除法國外尚有十六國，此為巴黎舉行之第卅八次博覽會。會場佔地四十三萬五千方公尺，其中四萬方公尺為宮殿大廈及亭閣等。據主持博覽會之人員估計，參觀此盛會者，至少將有二百五十萬人。</p>
<h3>三强足球熱烈演出　東華二比一勝鐵路</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東華對鐵路之三强足球邀請賽第三幕，昨日下午三時在逸園舉行，球迷近萬，開本季足球賽初見之盛況。鐵路為本屆市長杯冠軍，東華為久負盛名之勁旅，果然寶刀不老，經過九十分鐘之緊張劇戰，東華卒以二對一將鐵路擊退。表演相當精彩，尤以上半時為甚。東華連中二球，以二比零佔先，下半時鐵路獲中一十二碼球，張林根犯規，蕭子文罰中，鐵路二比一打破鴨蛋。東華之勝，後衛鞏固，吳祺祥張林根韓尼波三劍客，遂使鐵路前鋒，陷於不靈活，毫不能發揮作用，幸高保正力守中堅，將東華之攻勢阻遏。下半時東華後勁不濟，鐵路反攻猛烈，終未償願。全賽不失為一場相當緊張精彩之表演。</p>
<p>時間旣屆，鐵路下令進攻，中途撤回，東華全師壓境，鐵路腹地，險象叢生，東華諸將，環攻不已，陳明哲邊疆起義，一腳弔中，廖雄躍起接住，韓龍海迎面一撞未進，錢元慶得球妙塞空檔，陳明哲如脫繮之馬，竄入發射，廖雄防救不及，被陷一關，東華以一比零佔先。鐵路經此一失，努力反攻，但東華氣燄更盛，陳明哲邊境燃起烽火，挑向中央，韓龍海近門一射，廖雄撲出。鐵路靜極思動，吳炳浩左躍興兵，高保正勾中，林典義趕到一射，中張邦綸足部彈出。相持至卅六分鐘，李垚得球略盤數武，越過吳嘉邦，傳向門前，韓龍海竄上一頂，又告破關，上半時以二對零結束。休息過後，兩軍再戰，鐵路原陣未動。東華主將謝錫川高秀清趕到，替出李孔晋關元常。鐵路復仇心切，哀師力戰，張林根禁區犯規，蕭子文主罰十二碼，腳起球落，扳回一城。此後東華長力不支，鐵路苦苦進迫，賴有吳祺祥作擎天之柱，迫退攻勢。蕭子文廿碼處力拉，張邦綸救出。此後林典義直入刧營，絕妙機會，竟未奏功。迨銀笛長鳴，東華以一球佔勝。</p>

<h3>市長關懷米價狂漲　掀風作浪決予嚴懲　指定碼頭二處專供米船靠卸　簡化公用事業公司撥油手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕陳市長良於昨晚五時，在市府辦公室接見記者，對本市之物價，米源，及公用事業用油等問題，報吿如下：</p>
<p>（一）本市物價一度平穩後，日來又突吿瘋狂上漲，尤以糧食為甚，菜蔬之上漲，大致為環境所影響，由於戰事逼近，致蔬菜裝運困難，來源受阻後，因而影響價格暴漲。至米價之狂跳，其中不無奸商趁機抬價之跡象，市府已令社會局及警察局加以澈查，湯總司令亦已下令警備司令部作切實抑平，如查獲有奸商掀風作浪加害市民者，立加逮捕，並以戒嚴時期擾亂金融罪處以極刑。</p>
<p>（二）關於米源問題，最近本市因受戰事影響，凡米船運米來滬者，均停泊吳淞口外，不能逕駛浦江各碼頭，致無法起卸。又招商局最近有海列號，海天號，鴻章號米船三艘，滿載美經合總署及政府自香港購得之食米計一萬九千噸，亦因受戰事影響，中途折返香港。本人為解決米源問題，昨晨特親與湯總司令，石副總司令，及海軍總司令桂永淸等商討解救辦法，經決定指派副參謀長胡炘，及海軍第一艦隊司令董沐曾會同負責，令海軍方面在吳淞口讓出軍用碼頭一處，加指定張華浜碼頭，專供停泊米船之用。該兩碼頭均為安全地區，進口米船卽可在該地起卸。凡米船仍不願前往停泊者，可報吿市府，由當局另派船隻赴吳淞口外卸運來滬，同時並派海軍陸軍前往保護，使本市米源不至斷絕。</p>
<p>（三）市政府為解決公用事業用油使其供應不致中斷起見，經決定簡化撥油手續。按原定撥發手續，須經美經合總署滬分署，美援運用委員會，中央銀行，海關，市府等五機構會同核准，茲決定今後僅須由美經合總署滬分署蓋印核定後，卽予撥發，由美經合總署滬分署負責與以上各負責機構會同結算價格，將賬目通知各公用事業公司逕行繳付中央銀行。</p>
<h3>國行銀元牌價掛高　每枚千三百廿萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀元掛牌，中央銀行昨日首次調整，每枚新價為一千三百二十萬元，較舊價提高三百六十萬元。</p>
<p>又該行對各行莊提現之搭配比例，昨為現鈔六成，銀元一成，銀角二成，銀元每枚已作價為一三二〇萬元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀元市况，雖央行掛牌提高至每枚為一三二〇萬，但因黑市亦隨之上升，商號買賣，照常停頓，馬路銀牛，有增無减，喊價極度混亂。</p>
<p>金銀交換又縮三元，對搭做三六，三九。一種貨做三五，三八，二種貨做三七，四十。雜洋四六，四七。</p>
<p>金鈔交換，市勢平靜，仍為四十九元，五十一元。</p>

<h3>Close Coordination of Land, Sea, and Air Forces in Combat: National Army Achieves Victory at Gaoqiao, Pudong; Communist Troops Suffer Heavy Losses and Offensive is Contained</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Military sources at 10:50 AM on the 21st: Yesterday, the bandit forces, with a force of four elite armies, attacked our Gaoqiao position in Pudong. Our army, navy, and air force soldiers and officers launched a fierce joint attack, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, exerting their maximum power. The bandits suffered casualties of over 12,500, with corpses littering the field. Over 150 light and heavy machine guns were seized, and over 1,500 prisoners were captured. The bandit forces' formation was extremely chaotic, and their offensive gradually subsided. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Military news: Yesterday (21st), a large number of bandit troops were discovered near Gaoqiao, attempting to make trouble. Our front-line command immediately contacted the air force. Due to poor weather in the early morning, a large number of aircraft groups were not dispatched. In the afternoon, the weather cleared, and our air force dispatched a large formation of aircraft groups from a certain base, flying over Gaoqiao to bomb in shifts. At the same time, our navy coordinated with infantry and artillery, launching a three-pronged attack on the bandits. The bandits suffered heavy losses, and the bodies of the dead were stacked like pillows. Detailed battle results are still being investigated.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] According to the Air Force Headquarters, after the Communist army's attack on the Wusong District was frustrated, they gathered the 20th, 21st, 25th, 30th, 31st, and 5th Armies in the Pudong District. Last night, they launched a fierce offensive against our Gaoqiao-Gaohang line in Pudong, attempting to capture Gaoqiao and then cross the Huangpu River to attack our Wusong fortress area from the rear. Our military authorities were aware of the Communist army's intentions and made careful preparations. This morning (21st), as soon as the Communist army's offensive began, it was met with a brave counterattack by our army, navy, and air force. This morning (21st), although the area around the city was covered with low, dense clouds, less than 400 feet high, a unit of the air force still bravely took off. From 11:00 AM, as the weather improved, a large number of aircraft were deployed, attacking the Communist army in shifts at ten-minute intervals. Within a few hours, nearly one hundred aircraft were dispatched. Furthermore, due to the close and accurate coordination of the land-air liaison radio, bombing and strafing were all on target. The Communist army's offensive was immediately contained by us. The Communist army's losses in this battle are believed to be very heavy. As of 8:00 PM, our army had generally advanced one thousand meters southeast from Gaoqiao and has already achieved preliminary victory. Our aircraft suffered damage to six aircraft due to anti-aircraft fire from the Communist army during low-altitude bombing. However, each air force soldier became even more emboldened due to the damage to their aircraft and continued to attack during the night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a battle report at 11:00 AM on the 21st: A bandit force of over 300 in Pudong attempted to infiltrate the Zhonghua Wharf from Langli on the evening of the 20th. Our mobile troops immediately rushed to intercept them. The Zhonghua Wharf is still under our army's control and is as peaceful as usual.</p>
<h3>Yuepu Southern War: National Army Attacks, Destroying Nine Communist Army Bunkers in One Go; Fierce Fighting on the Liujiahang International Radio Line</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a battle report: Yesterday (21st) at 6:40 AM, in order to expand the victory, the Tank Situation Headquarters specially dispatched multiple tanks to cooperate with a certain unit of our army, attacking the enemy from the southwest corner of Wujia祠 and Wujia寨 south of Yuepu. A senior tank commander personally directed the operation. Under the cover of powerful artillery fire, our tanks exerted unparalleled power, destroying nine bandit bunkers in one go and recapturing several important strongholds. In this battle, we killed or wounded over 1,300 bandits, captured 263 alive, and seized a large number of spoils of war. This is the first unprecedented and brilliant victory since the tank unit cooperated with infantry in combat.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a battle report at 9:00 PM on the 21st: (1) At approximately 2:00 AM this morning, approximately 300 bandits, accompanied by three mountain guns, attacked our left flank of Yuepu and used trenching operations to approach the barbed wire fence. A certain defending unit immediately counterattacked, and the bandits were defeated and retreated, and we captured many prisoners. (2) Yesterday (21st) afternoon, a certain unit of our army, under the cover of the navy, advanced towards the northwest area of Gujiazhai and is still confronting our army. (3) At dawn yesterday (21st), a bandit force of about several dozen attempted to infiltrate our Shizilin position. Our army was on high alert, calmly responded to the battle, and dispatched another elite force to launch a flanking attack, annihilating most of the invading bandits and seizing a large number of spoils of war.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a battle report at 7:00 AM on the 21st: (1) On the Yuepu-Yanghang line, the bandits on the front have been severely annihilated for days and are in disarray, with no ability to attack again. Currently, they appear to be entirely awaiting reinforcements, so the battles in the past two days have been quiet. (2) The bandits in Liujiahang International Radio Station and other places frequently attacked us yesterday (20th), especially on the International Radio Station line, where the fighting was the fiercest. A certain unit of our loyal and brave officers and soldiers calmly responded to the battle, repelling the invading bandits. The bandits' corpses were piled up, and blood formed ditches. In this battle, over 800 bandits were killed or wounded, 160 were captured alive, and 2 heavy machine guns, 4 light machine guns, and 130 various rifles were seized. The battle stopped slightly at dusk.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a battle report at 11:00 AM on the 21st: (1) The bandits in Qibao southeast of Xin Zhuang Town set fire to local houses all day on the 20th and forcibly abducted many young men and women. Our artillery frequently bombarded the bandits fiercely. Currently, there is no major change in the battle situation in that area. (2) A unit of the bandit army once infiltrated our defending army's position from near Sunjiachi on the left side of the Shanghai-Tai Road. They were completely surrounded by us on the night of the 20th and were completely cleared by the morning of the 21st.</p>

<h3>Chen Cheng Left Guangzhou for Taiwan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] Chen Cheng, Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government, left Guangzhou on the Ziqiang special plane at 10:40 AM on the 21st to return to Taiwan. Jin Yanjiagan, Director of the Department of Finance, accompanied him.</p>
<h3>Acting President Li Publishes a Message, Clarifying the Government's Purpose in Engaging in War, Hoping for National Unity and Cooperation to Achieve the Task of Self-Salvation and National Salvation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th] Acting President Li published a message to the compatriots of the whole country on the 20th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Compatriots across the country! Four months ago, the government, unwilling to allow the country and people to continue suffering the horrors of war, followed the unanimous desire of the people of the whole country for peace and decided to advocate peace. Zongren also repeatedly expressed his willingness to use the highest sincerity, personally sacrificing everything, in order to achieve peace. Unexpectedly, all these sincere expressions and painstaking efforts to compromise have come to naught. Because the Chinese Communists have never given up their attempt to conquer the whole country by force, they put forward a so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" that was extremely harsh and unacceptable to the government. At the same time, when the government replied asking them to reconsider, they disregarded it and ordered a general offensive, forcibly crossing the Yangtze River. As a result, the peace talks that the compatriots of the whole country eagerly hoped for could not continue and finally broke down, and the flames of war spread and expanded again. Who is responsible for this breakdown of peace talks and the continuation of the war, who is not sincere in seeking peace, and who has made the people suffer the misery of war again? All of this, the whole country and even the world, can make a fair judgment based on ironclad facts. I will not explain more here. But there is one point that I want the compatriots of the whole country to clearly understand, that is, the Chinese Communist Party, due to its international background and its basic spirit, must use violence to eliminate all non-Communist forces, must use violence to rule all the people of China, and must destroy China's excellent traditional culture and morality for thousands of years. They are not only without pity, driving all the people of China to sacrifice in today's civil war, but also in future international wars, they will make our country and people loyal to the Communist International and die for it. The so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" they put forward this time is full of this spirit and fully exposes their conspiracy and poisonous plan, which also explains the content of their so-called "liberation" work. Compatriots! I ask you, do we need such "liberation"? Should we take our lives and country to sacrifice for another international group and follow them down the road to destruction? If not, we must resist this violent oppression, because we want to survive, we want freedom, we want democracy, and we want to protect our country's independence. The government is fighting today based on this purpose, and compatriots across the country should understand this meaning and make the greatest effort to cooperate with the government to achieve the task of self-salvation and national salvation.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that war is the most cruel. After more than ten years of continuous internal and external wars, the people are impoverished and the country is devastated. The government cannot bear to engage in war unless it is absolutely necessary. I personally have also believed in the past that the dispute between brothers should be resolved politically, and there is no reason to resort to arms. This is my basic concept of advocating peace. But the Chinese Communists not only have no sincerity for peace, but also want not only the government to surrender to them, but also the people of the whole country to surrender to them, and want all the people of China to be placed under the violent rule of the Chinese Communists. The facts shown today in the so-called "liberated areas" are enough to prove their cruelty and hypocrisy. Some people and young people in the "liberated areas" have fled to government areas. Some poor peasants and workers have been forced to become cannon fodder under their so-called "joining the army" and "offering grain" calls and have been squeezed dry. Some young people have no books to read, and some of the "democratic people" they advocate have become ornaments under strict surveillance. In short, the people in the "liberated areas" today not only have no freedom in life, but also suffer great oppression and terror in their thoughts and spirit all the time. Furthermore, in the peace talks this time, the Chinese Communists deliberately put forward the most harsh conditions and immediately began to cross the river without considering our reply, fearing that there would still be room for mediation and that their conspiracy would not succeed. These facts show that the Chinese Communists are determined to cruelly conquer the people to complete their attempt to conquer all of China by force and rule all of China by violence. Therefore, today I want to tell the compatriots of the whole country that I stand in the position of the government and with my sense of responsibility to the country and people. I cannot sacrifice the sovereign right of national independence in our hands. I cannot bury the right of the compatriots of the whole country to live freely. Therefore, I know that the continuation of the war will increase the suffering of the people, but in order to resist this violent oppression and destruction, I must painfully end the war with war. I hope that the compatriots of the whole country will further understand that if we cannot endure the current pain and work together to resist the violence of the Chinese Communists, the pain we will suffer in life and spirit in the future will be a thousand times greater than today. Everything that the compatriots in the so-called "liberated areas" are suffering is a good example.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Chinese Communists have publicly sworn that they will fight side by side with the Soviet Union in the next world war. This is tantamount to the Chinese Communists having already signed a pre-sale contract to sacrifice the lives and property of our compatriots across the country for others before the outbreak of the Third World War. This is what every person with a national and national concept cannot tolerate. In the past, the government accepted material assistance from the United States. The Chinese Communists have repeatedly accused us of being a traitorous government. Compatriots, everyone thinks about it, who is willing to sell the country? If accepting American aid is selling the country, then which country did not accept American aid in the Second World War? Wouldn't they all become traitorous governments? After the war, the Soviet Union and other countries also asked the United States for assistance. Why did the Chinese Communists not accuse the Soviet Union of being a traitorous country? Why did the people of other countries not accuse their own governments of being traitorous countries? Compatriots! Let us think again, is it selling the country to accept American aid that treats me equally, or is it sacrificing our country's independence and autonomy to accept the leadership of the Communist International and make our country and people loyal to the Communist International and die for it? We must know that the Chinese Communist Party today takes another country as their motherland and uses the national flag of another country as the national flag of China. Therefore, they say with madness that they will fight side by side with the Soviet Union. This is what all people with a national and national concept cannot bear to hear. Compatriots! We must also know that the reason why the Chinese Communists oppose American aid is to deliberately deepen the poverty of the Chinese people and develop the power of communism in the poverty and hunger of the whole of China, so they do not hesitate to sacrifice our country and people to achieve their so-called world revolution. Fellow compatriots! I ask you, do we need such a revolution? If this revolution succeeds, perhaps half of the lives of the Chinese people will be sacrificed, and the country of China will be completely reduced to an appendage of another country. The continued development of this violent force will inevitably threaten Southeast Asia and even the whole world. Therefore, in order to protect national independence, the survival of the people, and world peace, we must fight to resist the violence of the Chinese Communists.</p>
<p>In short, compatriots! We should be clear that today this war is definitely not for the government, but for the people, for the country, and not for the interests of a few, but for the struggle for survival and freedom of the people of the whole country, not for a certain party or faction, but for the struggle for national independence. The government's military situation is undoubtedly quite bad, but I think that if our compatriots across the country can have a correct understanding and distinction of reality and the future, good and bad, and clearly understand the conspiracy of the Chinese Communists to harm the country and people, then the reversal of the military situation and all the difficulties and hardships need not be worried too much. Because in history, only justice can defeat force, and those who believe in force will eventually fail. Here, I can responsibly tell the compatriots of the whole country that from today onwards, the government I lead has a firm determination to resist this violent oppression. Even to the last soldier, we will never give up our responsibility. At the same time, we must eliminate any obstacles and carry out reforms in politics, economy, and military affairs, and ensure that all government measures can adapt to the needs of the times and the demands of the people, in order to rigorously organize the government's line-up and strengthen the government's power to engage in the anti-communist war to protect the interests of the country and people. I sincerely hope that our compatriots across the country can recognize the meaning and purpose of this war. For the sake of self-salvation and national salvation, we must voluntarily and actively do our best to assist the government and work together in this war against violence, anti-deception, anti-totalitarianism, anti-terrorism, and anti-aggression. With the support of the broad masses, I believe that we will inevitably achieve final victory. Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>The Allegation that Hong Kong is for US Use: US Navy Department Claims Ignorance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] A spokesman for the US Navy Department recently stated that the Navy Department has no knowledge of the rumor that Britain is willing to provide Hong Kong as a US naval base for the Chinese side.</p>
<h3>Explosion at Ammunition Depot in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] A warehouse of a certain unit in the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou, which was a wooden house built by the enemy and puppet regime, was dilapidated due to disrepair. The old and discarded shells stored inside were heated by rainwater, causing a chemical reaction. It exploded naturally at 9:00 AM on the 21st, burning down the guard room of the warehouse on the spot. Fortunately, other houses were not affected, and the losses were very small.</p>
<h3>Traffic Police Soldier Solidifying One Requests to be Transferred to the Front Line for Combat</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Gong Guoyi, a soldier of the First Battalion of the Second Traffic Police Unit, sent a letter to Commander-in-Chief Tang asking to be transferred to the front line for combat, stating that since the Battle to Defend Greater Shanghai had begun, he still felt apologetic for staying in the city every day. He was sorry to the country, the people, the teachings of the Father of the Nation, and a group of martyrs and soldiers. He asked to be transferred to the front line to serve, and then asked to be transferred back after the victory in Greater Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Salary Payment Method for Civil and Military Personnel this Month: Shanghai Calculates According to the Local Customs Gold Unit Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 21st] At today's political affairs meeting of the Executive Yuan, the method of paying salaries to civil and military personnel in May was discussed. It was resolved that the payment of salaries and allowances to public servants and teachers in May would be calculated at a rate of one Customs Gold Unit to six Hong Kong dollars in Guangzhou, and according to the local Customs Gold Unit exchange rate in Shanghai. Areas outside Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Huanghai would be divided into three zones according to the method used in April, and it was stipulated that each Customs Gold Unit would be calculated as 1.8 million Gold Yuan in the first zone, 1.4 million Gold Yuan in the second zone, and 1 million Gold Yuan in the third zone to issue Gold Yuan coupons. Military personnel would all be handled according to the standards of the second zone.</p>
<h3>Main Force Lost, Publicly Abandoned, and Relatives Separated: Wu Huawen Detained by His Subordinates in Pudong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Reliable military news, Wu Huawen was willing to sell himself to the Communist bandits after leading his troops to defect in the Jinan campaign. During this time when bandits crossed the river, Wu was driven to the front as a vanguard, serving as cannon fodder in every human wave tactic. His troops were always under the surveillance and control of the Communist bandits, and were forced to participate in combat. After crossing the river, they were transferred to the suburbs of Shanghai and roamed around in the Pudong area. After days of joint suppression and bombing by the national army's land and air forces, the main force was almost completely lost, and the remnants had no fighting spirit. Wu still had to carry out the Communist Party's orders, driving his troops to their deaths. According to a Communist prisoner's confession, Wu was bought by the Communist army with a certain amount of gold bars when he defected in central Shandong. His important aides on the left and right expressed dissatisfaction and often complained. Recently, Wu was detained by them in a certain place in Pudong, and he was ordered to hand over the Communist Party's gold bars.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Gui Inspects the Battle on the Flagship: Machine Guns Heavily Fire on Enemy Positions; Heavy Smoke Covers the Jiang'an Bank Outside Wusongkou East Depot</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] A certain unit of the Navy's First Fleet yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM shelled the Communist army attacking Gaoqiao from the waters of Dongku, Yangjiazha, and Tianzhutang outside Wusongkou, achieving remarkable results. According to reports from ground troops, more than a thousand Communist soldiers in the Dongku, Yangjiazha, and Tianzhutang areas defected to the national army due to the intense shelling by naval warships. There were more than 500 casualties. The navy cooperated with ground troops in combat for three hours yesterday afternoon. Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, First Fleet Commander Ma Jizhuang, and Captain Liu Guangkai took the flagship to the front line to command. Commander-in-Chief Gui ordered the flagship he was on to sail close to the Communist army's position in Pudong at a distance of 2,000 meters, using the 40mm machine guns that the Communist army feared most to fire intensively. The reporter saw through binoculars that more than a dozen Communist strongholds were destroyed and caught fire. At that time, in addition to the ground troops engaging in positional warfare with the Communist army, the air force dispatched three bombers to indicate naval firing targets and carried out bombing and strafing. Heavy smoke covered the Jiang'an bank outside Dongku. Many national army soldiers relied on the back-to-water fortifications to block the Communist army's various activities. Fishermen on Chongming Island fishing with nets, as well as farmhouses and fishing families and pedestrians in fields more than ten miles away from the front line, could be seen from the flagship. Gui and Commander Ma and other senior naval generals commanded other warships to fight by radio on the flagship. The gunners on the ship were calm, careful, and meticulous. Gui told reporters that the fighting will of the naval soldiers and officers is extremely strong. After the retreat from Nanjing, the navy has formed a strong and seamless fortress. He believes that with the victory of the Pudong offensive, Shanghai can be stabilized for at least three months. General Gui believes that the bandit army actually has many difficulties. He believes that we should put will first. A strong will combined with artillery will definitely achieve victory.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Calm First, Order First</h3>
<p>As the flames of war draw closer to Shanghai, the streets become even more filled with wartime scenes. The most obvious are the panic of the people and the eastward and westward movements of refugees. Not only are people from the suburbs moving to the city, but people in the city are also moving to the safe areas they envision, with everyone believing that another place is ultimately safer than their own. This is the existence of illusion, which not only increases the psychological panic of the citizens but also increases their material losses. Standing from the perspective of public opinion, we must shout the slogan "Calm First" to the six million citizens of the city. This state of being restless all day long only increases the danger to society. Frankly speaking, in today's Shanghai, fate is shared, and there is no distinction between the southeast, northwest, east, or west. Anyway, everything is the same. What is the difference between fifty steps and a hundred steps in the end!</p>
<p>Logically, obtaining safety and avoiding danger are basic needs of life. Thinking carefully about it, this need is actually more urgent than eating. The purpose of eating is to maintain life, but once safety is ignored, danger approaches, and life is lost in an instant, what is the use of just talking about eating? Safety is directly related to life. The "Safety First" advocated by Westerners is truly worthy of contemplation.</p>
<p>As the world changes, the essence of the safety issue also changes. Many dangers in the past, such as floods and fierce beasts drowning and eating people, have now become relics. On the other hand, the modern era of culture and machines has brought a brand new and more serious danger. Life has become more stressful, cities have become more crowded, and both people and things have become more mobile, thus creating dangers that did not exist before. Car accidents are the most prominent example. In the United States, the total number of people who die under the wheels of cars every year is twenty to thirty thousand. According to statistical reports, the year with the fewest deaths recently was 1923, but even then, 18,400 people were killed. In 1941, it was 39,969, and in 1949, it was 28,076. Among the deaths, young people aged fifteen to twenty-four accounted for 52%. In World War I, the United States lost 300,000 soldiers, while 325,000 were crushed to death by cars at the same time, almost one person dying every eighteen minutes! In the United States, the total number of accidental injuries and deaths per year is about 100,000. In the past twelve years, more than one million people have died, 25 million have been seriously injured, and the loss is at least 400,000,000 gold dollars.</p>
<p>In today's civilized countries, the leading cause of death is not disease but accidental injuries. In the United States, between the ages of three and thirty-eight for males and three to twenty-one for females, death from accidental injuries is more common than any disease or epidemic. This is the case in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. With artillery fire raging in the suburbs of Shanghai, the danger is truly unimaginable for people with outdated minds surrounded by new weapons in a small battlefield. On the 16th, when a group of air force planes flew over the city on their way to the front lines, one plane suddenly lost control and dropped a bomb due to the vibration on Tangshan Road. On the 18th, when the Zhongxing ship was departing for Taiwan, the order at the pier was chaotic. Some people boarded the ship without buying tickets, and some bought black market tickets near the ship temporarily but could not get on. Later, the gangway was removed, and people were hoisted up from the ship with ropes. How great is the danger in this situation! These past few days, citizens fleeing from Pudong and the suburbs have been passing through rivers and streams late at night, pushing and trampling each other, and the crowds are unbearable, making it possible to cause death everywhere. There is always the danger of escaping for one's life but losing it.</p>
<p>Citizens of Shanghai have been sitting in a powder keg recently, and their psychology is inevitably abnormal. They are startled by the slightest sound and see enemies everywhere. In their imaginations, they will also create something out of nothing. Their nerves are tense, and they react greatly to the slightest stimulus. When rumors start, they believe them to be true without asking questions. The day before yesterday, a slight sound of gunfire was heard at the Sixteenth Wharf, and people thought something was wrong. Stores closed one after another, and pedestrians and rickshaw pullers scattered in panic, running away with all their might. The road was in complete chaos. The pedestrians were running away while asking people what was going on. But no one could answer what was going on. However, everyone blindly followed others and ran away in a mess. The entire Nanshi fell into a commotion. It turned out that nothing had happened. It was just that the guarding troops in the Huangpu River fired their guns to prohibit ships from approaching the shore. This situation is like "one dog barks at a shadow, and a hundred dogs bark in response." There is nothing wrong in the world, but mediocre people trouble themselves. However, the danger lies hidden in this chaotic scene.</p>
<p>I remember during the "August 13th" incident, on the evening of November 7th, there was a rumor that Pudong had fallen, and people rushed to cross the river at night, and countless people drowned. On November 9th, Fenglin Bridge was lost, and corpses piled up along the Binjiang. Many children with faces stained with dark blood sucked on their mothers' stiff nipples and fell on the shore. Before the war, wasn't the Shanghai concession a safe haven? But the Public Concession had such an shocking report: "From August 13th to October 12th, in these two months, 2,057 non-combatants (i.e., citizens) and 36 foreigners died from stray bullets in the Shanghai Public Concession. This number of deaths is 33 times more than the 71 deaths and 116 injuries during the "January 28th" incident. Casualties not reported to the patrol room are not included in this example." Remember the past, and you will be a teacher for the future.</p>
<p>In short, in this time of war and danger, only by maintaining calm and responding to all changes with an unchanging spirit can we turn danger into safety. We appeal to the six million citizens of Shanghai with this, and at the same time, we hope that the police authorities can take "maintaining order" as their sacred duty and maintain the order of Shanghai with all their strength.</p>

<h3>Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to Open Tomorrow; Acheson Arrives in Paris; Confers with Bevin and Schuman at French Foreign Ministry on Common Position; Vyshinsky's Entourage Departs Moscow</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Paris, 21st - A broadcast from Paris states that US Secretary of State Acheson, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman met at the French Foreign Ministry today for about 15 minutes to discuss adopting a common position to attend the Four-Power Conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky left Moscow for Paris today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] US Secretary of State Acheson, aboard the presidential plane "Independence," arrived at Orly Airport here at 9:03 this morning to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which opens on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived here from London today. He will approve, together with Acheson and Schuman, the common policy of the three powers in the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which was secretly drafted by the three countries' diplomatic experts this week, before the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Well-informed sources said that the opinions of the Western three powers have now almost converged, and it is expected that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will face the unanimous position of the three powers on the following points: (1) Not to allow the Soviet Union to participate in the control of the Ruhr; (2) To maintain West Germany; (3) Never to give up aid to Germany. The Soviet Embassy here does not yet know when Vyshinsky will arrive. Reports from Moscow say that Vyshinsky is accompanied by as many as 70 people, including German experts, political advisors, and secretaries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 20th] Diplomatic sources said today that Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will likely reveal a recent change in the Soviet leadership at the beginning of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Whether this indicates a major change in Soviet policy remains to be seen. With Vyshinsky succeeding Molotov as Foreign Minister after the recent major changes in the Soviet leadership, it is expected that his remarks after the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference here on Monday will provide clues to the significance of the Soviet leadership change. Western allies believe that if there is any change in Soviet policy, it will turn for the better, so Western diplomats will observe signs of the Soviet Union wanting to end its obstructionist tactics. In the past 24 hours, the Soviet Union has issued two important announcements, apparently in preparation for the Foreign Ministers' Conference: (1) After the US and Britain suggested to the Soviet delegation at the UN General Assembly in New York to resolve the Greek civil war, Soviet representative Gromyko suggested a possible solution. (2) The Soviet Union intends to repatriate all remaining Japanese prisoners of war to Japan. It is generally believed that these two announcements by the Soviet Union are actions in the Soviet peace offensive. These two issues are unlikely to be submitted for discussion at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, as the purpose of this conference is to specifically discuss the German issue, but there may be informal talks on the Greek situation. Deputy representatives of the UK, US, and France have drafted a comprehensive plan on the German issue to deal with Vyshinsky. According to various sources, the success of the Foreign Ministers' Conference depends solely on the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Austrian Foreign Minister Warns Four Powers: Occupation Must End; Austrian Peace Treaty Cannot Be Delayed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Vienna, 21st] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber said in a speech to the Austrian People's Party Congress yesterday that if the Four Powers cannot resolve the Austrian issue at this Foreign Ministers' Conference, Austria will refuse to pay any occupation fees if necessary. Austria will also declare that the Austrian issue is no longer a topic for international conferences to discuss, and then immediately begin to organize a federal army to end the occupation.</p>
<p>He emphasized that we must tell the powers that the current state of occupation, disguised as liberation, must end. We must also show the powers that the Austrian people's patience has run out. In the future, the Austrian people will adopt a more active policy, with Austria's own interests taking precedence over the demands and orders of the Allied governments. If the Four Powers refuse to discuss the Austrian issue at the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference and refuse to recognize Austria's right to build an army and demand an end to the occupation, Austria will accuse the power that refuses of aggressive actions against Austria in the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Pravda Commentary</h3>
<p>Success or Failure of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference Depends on the Attitude of the West</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 20th] "Pravda" published today, criticizing the attitude of the UK, US, and France as the reason why an agreement on the German issue could not be reached. It continued, saying that the division of Germany has led to the division of Europe. But the Western countries' policy of division, their refusal to cooperate with the Soviet Union, and their abandonment of the plans obtained in Potsdam have promoted the development of a worldwide movement in favor of peace and against war. The agreement of the four countries has allowed the Foreign Ministers' Conference to be reopened and to discuss the basic German issues again, but the success or failure of this discussion will depend on the position taken by the Western countries.</p>
<h3>Railway Workers in West Berlin Stage a Strike</h3>
<p>Demand Wages Paid in West German Marks</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 21st] Twelve thousand railway workers in West Berlin began a strike at noon yesterday in opposition to the Soviet-controlled Railway Administration, and railway transport lines in West Berlin were also blocked as a result. The Railway Administration sent armed forces to interfere with the strike, and clashes occurred with anti-communist striking workers. A row of elevated railway passenger cars was burned down in the melee. The West Berlin government announced that West German police will suppress further interference with the strike by communists in the Soviet zone. It is heard that some communists have expressed sympathy for the strikers, believing that the workers' demand for wages to be paid in West German marks (worth four times more than East German marks) is quite reasonable. At the same time, the Railway Administration has ordered West German freight cars to unload goods in Potsdam and then transfer them to Berlin by truck. Soviet freight cars are also unloading and transferring goods outside the city of Berlin.</p>
<h3>Four-Power Negotiations on German Economic Cooperation Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] Four-power negotiations on German economic cooperation were smoother today than in previous days. The meeting was held at the Soviet headquarters in Karlshorst. According to a British spokesman, the meeting has made headway in reorganizing trade between East and West Germany.</p>
<h3>The Only Condition for Ending the Greek Civil War: The Rebels Must Lay Down Their Arms; Official Attitude Towards Soviet Proposal is Cold</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 20th] The Greek Cabinet held a special cabinet meeting today to discuss the Soviet proposal for ending the civil war, but both official and non-official sources expressed a cold attitude.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 20th] Greek News Agency reported: Greek Minister of Public Security Rentis said today that if Greece is to obtain peace, all powers, including the Soviet Union, must recognize that the Greek Communist Party must never participate in the political life of Greece.</p>
<p>The powers should understand the goal of the Greek guerrilla leaders, which is to understand Greece, and their unrestricted activities are no longer possible. According to informal sources, the Greek government's policy towards the guerrillas is as follows: (1) The guerrillas must surrender unconditionally; (2) The government is prepared to pardon communists who can "repent and reform"; (3) The Greek Communist Party cannot be recognized or participate in any elections; (4) The Greek government may consider the participation of non-communist left-wing elements in politics. British Ambassador Norton and Charge d'Affaires McNair visited Foreign Minister Tsaldaris tonight to inform him of the Soviet proposal for the three powers to negotiate an end to the Greek civil war.</p>
<p>The Course of Negotiations between the US, UK, and France</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] After lifting the Berlin blockade, the Soviet Union again proposed to the UK and US to end the three-year Greek civil war. According to TASS news, the Soviet Union has proposed a conditional solution to the Greek civil war to the US and UK. London and Washington immediately released information on informal contacts. According to the State Department, these informal contacts began at a banquet at the home of UN Secretary-General Lie in New York on the 26th of last month. On the 4th of this month, US Deputy Secretary of State Rusk and British Undersecretary McNeil were invited by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko to meet and talk, and they continued to talk at the UN General Assembly last Saturday.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Proposed a Solution</p>
<p>Gromyko put forward several conditions: (1) All countries should stop all military aid to Greece. (2) The relevant countries should supervise the re-election in Greece, and the Soviet Union is willing to participate in the supervision. (3) The relevant countries should organize a monitoring group to manage the northern border of Greece. Gromyko also conveyed the conditions put forward by the guerrillas: (1) Order a ceasefire; (2) Implement a general amnesty; (3) Re-election. Rusk replied to Gromyko at the time that the crux of the problem was the illegal assistance provided by Greece's neighboring countries to the rebels, and that the United Nations organization was the formal place to discuss this issue. According to the British Foreign Office, McNeil also told Gromyko that if Greece's northern neighbors stopped aiding the Greek rebels, the war could be stopped. After several talks, Gromyko immediately returned to Moscow to ask for instructions from the government.</p>
<p>The US Respects Athens' Opinion</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] The UK and US today officially notified the Soviet Union that they do not intend to begin negotiations to end the Greek civil war without fully exchanging views with the Athens authorities. At the same time, the US State Department has stated to the Soviet Union that the US will continue to assist the Greek government in defending itself against aggression. Because the US believes that the discussion of the Greek issue must fully solicit the opinions of the Greek government, the US cannot agree to discuss the Greek issue at the next Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, New York, 20th] "The New York Times" said in an editorial today that Secretary of State Acheson has made it clear that the government does not intend to consider concluding a Pacific treaty along the lines of the Atlantic Treaty at present. It is true that the political nature of the Pacific region is different.

<h3>Three-Power Football Enthusiastically Performed; Tung Wah Wins 2-1 Against Railway</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The third act of the Tung Wah vs. Railway Three-Power Football Invitational Tournament was held at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday. Nearly 10,000 fans attended, a grand occasion rarely seen in the football season. Railway is the champion of this year's Mayor's Cup, and Tung Wah is a well-known veteran team. As expected, they showed their prowess and defeated Railway by 2 to 1 after 90 minutes of intense battle. The performance was quite wonderful, especially in the first half. Tung Wah scored two goals in a row, taking the lead with a score of 2-0. In the second half, Railway was awarded a penalty kick. Zhang Lingen committed a foul, and Xiao Ziwen scored, breaking the egg for Railway with a score of 2-1. Tung Wah's victory was due to its solid defense. Wu Qixiang, Zhang Lingen, and Han Nibo, the three musketeers, made the Railway forwards inflexible and unable to play their role. Fortunately, Gao Baozheng firmly defended the center and blocked Tung Wah's offensive. In the second half, Tung Wah's stamina was insufficient, and Railway's counterattack was fierce, but they did not achieve their wish. The whole match was a quite intense and wonderful performance.</p>
<p>When the time came, Railway ordered an attack but withdrew midway. Tung Wah pressed forward with all its strength, and the Railway hinterland was in danger. Tung Wah's generals attacked endlessly. Chen Mingzhe started an uprising on the frontier and kicked a ball in the middle. Liao Xiong jumped up to catch it, but Han Longhai crashed into it head-on and failed to score. Qian Yuanqing got the ball and cleverly passed it through the gap. Chen Mingzhe rushed in like a horse freed from its reins and shot. Liao Xiong couldn't defend in time and lost a goal. Tung Wah took the lead with a score of 1-0. After this loss, Railway worked hard to counterattack, but Tung Wah's momentum was even stronger. Chen Mingzhe ignited the flames of war on the border and pointed it towards the center. Han Longhai shot near the goal, but Liao Xiong扑ed it out. Railway moved from silence, Wu Binghao jumped to the left and started an army, Gao Baozheng hooked it in the middle, Lin Dianyi rushed to shoot, hit Zhang Banglun's foot and bounced out. Holding each other until 36 minutes, Li Yao got the ball and circled around a few times, passing Wu Jiabang, and passed it in front of the goal. Han Longhai rushed up and headed it in, and another goal was scored. The first half ended with a score of 2-0. After the break, the two armies fought again, with Railway's original formation unchanged. Tung Wah's main generals Xie Xichuan and Gao Xiuqing arrived and replaced Li Kongjin and Guan Yuanchang. Railway was eager for revenge and fought hard. Zhang Lingen fouled in the penalty area, Xiao Ziwen took the penalty kick, and the ball fell into the net, pulling back a goal. After that, Tung Wah's stamina was insufficient, and Railway pressed hard, relying on Wu Qixiang as a pillar to repel the offensive. Xiao Ziwen pulled hard from 20 yards away, and Zhang Banglun saved it. After that, Lin Dianyi went straight into the camp, a wonderful opportunity, but it did not work. When the silver whistle blew, Tung Wah won by one goal.</p>

<p>The Ya Team is a rising force, having won the third place in the Mayor's Cup women's group. Their strength is quite formidable, with famous players such as Wang Shan, Zhu Jiazhen, Wang Zhelun, Qian Mengyue, and Sun Fengzhu in their lineup. Their defense is solid. John is the elite of the school team, brave and skilled, and their abilities are evenly matched with the Ya Team, making a fierce battle inevitable.</p>
<p>Since winning the League A and Mayor's Cup championships consecutively, Hua Lian has been showcasing their skills in friendly matches, and they have been victorious in every game, not encountering any opponents. This shows that their championship style is truly extraordinary. Old Rain combines the elites of Da Gong and Hui Li, and their lineup is well-organized.

<h3>Mayor Concerned About Soaring Rice Prices, Severe Punishment for Those Stirring Up Trouble, Designating Two Wharf Areas for Rice Ships to Dock, Simplifying Oil Allocation Procedures for Public Utility Companies</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Chen Liang met with reporters at the City Hall office at 5:00 PM yesterday and reported on the city's commodity prices, rice supply, and oil supply for public utilities as follows:</p>
<p>(1) After a period of stability, commodity prices in the city have suddenly risen sharply again recently, especially food. The rise in vegetable prices is largely influenced by the environment. Due to the approaching war, the transportation of vegetables has become difficult, and the source has been blocked, thus affecting the price surge. As for the soaring rice prices, there are signs that unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to raise prices. The city government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Department to thoroughly investigate. Commander-in-Chief Tang has also ordered the Garrison Command to effectively suppress the prices. If any unscrupulous merchants are found to be stirring up trouble and harming citizens, they will be immediately arrested and severely punished with the death penalty for disrupting the financial system during the martial law period.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the rice supply issue, recently, due to the impact of the war, all rice ships transporting rice to Shanghai have been anchored outside the Wusongkou, unable to directly drive to the wharves of the Huangpu River, making it impossible to unload. In addition, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently had three rice ships, Hai Lie, Hai Tian, and Hong Zhang, fully loaded with 19,000 tons of rice purchased by the US Economic Cooperation Administration and the government from Hong Kong, but they had to return to Hong Kong midway due to the impact of the war. In order to solve the rice supply problem, I personally discussed solutions with Commander-in-Chief Tang, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Shi, and Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing yesterday morning, and it was decided to assign Deputy Chief of Staff Hu Xin and Naval First Fleet Commander Dong Muzeng to jointly be responsible. The Navy was ordered to vacate a military wharf in Wusongkou and designate the Zhanghuabang Wharf exclusively for rice ships to dock. Both wharves are safe areas, and imported rice ships can unload there. If any rice ships are still unwilling to go there, they can report to the city government, and the authorities will send other ships to Wusongkou to unload and transport them to Shanghai, and send the Navy and Army to protect them at the same time, so as to prevent the rice supply in the city from being cut off.</p>
<p>(3) In order to solve the problem of oil supply for public utilities and prevent its interruption, the city government has decided to simplify the oil allocation procedures. According to the original allocation procedures, it was necessary to obtain joint approval from five institutions: the Shanghai Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, the US Aid Utilization Committee, the Central Bank, the Customs, and the City Government. It is now decided that in the future, only the seal and approval of the Shanghai Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration will be required for allocation. The Shanghai Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration will be responsible for settling the prices with the above responsible institutions and notifying the public utility companies to directly pay the Central Bank.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Mediates Solution to Substitute Rice Distribution Method, Labor and Management Agreement Reached on Four Points at Private Cotton Textile Factories</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Private cotton textile factories in the city had labor-management disputes due to a reduction in the distribution of substitute rice. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Labor Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the General Labor Union, convened labor and management representatives of the industry to discuss the method and stipulated four points for the distribution of substitute rice: (1) Six dou of substitute rice will still be issued each month (including one dou of special ration rice). In addition to the one dou of special ration rice, which will be calculated according to the government's ration price, and another one dou calculated at 4 jiao and 8 fen and 4 li per dou, the remaining four dou will be calculated according to the following formula, deducting 2 jiao and 4 fen and 2 li of silver yuan from the wages per dou.

<p>0.20 (base salary) × 1.21 × (increase in gold yuan) × 20% (silver yuan conversion) = 0.0242 (silver yuan price per sheng)</p>
<p>Note: (1) Those who provide three meals are deducted 2 jiao at the end of the 34th year of the Republic. (2) Those who provide two meals are equivalent to issuing six dou of rice, of which four dou are deducted according to the first method (2 jiao and 4 fen and 2 li of silver yuan per dou), and the other two dou are handled according to the first item. (3) Those who provide one meal will still receive four dou of substitute rice for the whole month (including one dou of special ration rice), and the deduction method will be in accordance with the first item.

<h3>Robbery on Zhejiang South Road</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Five armed robbers suddenly came to No. 14, Bao'anfang, Zhejiang South Road at noon yesterday. Two spoke with a northern accent and three with a local accent. After entering the room, they drove the residents to a corner and had one robber watch over them. The remaining robbers went upstairs to search through boxes and luggage for an hour. As a result, 75 taels of gold and 300 silver dollars were robbed. By the time the police station in charge received the report and dispatched a police car, the robbers had already escaped.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Still Not Open, Cooking Oil and Flour Soar</h3>
<p>Rice market transactions are still stalled, and neither the North nor South markets opened yesterday. Due to the excessive rise in financial commodity prices, it was difficult for cargo owners to quote prices. Rice shops were also less willing to purchase because door-to-door sales were difficult. Therefore, both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and no transactions were made until the market closed. The market quotation list was not issued. Door-to-door sales prices followed the rise in gold and silver, and the asking prices were chaotic, with white glutinous rice at 400-450 million.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>There were slightly more transactions as door-to-door sales suddenly became brisk. Local businesses increased their purchases, and market sentiment rose. Furthermore, due to the rise in gold and silver prices, the increase was particularly sharp. Raw soybean oil was at 1.1 billion, raw rapeseed oil at 950 million, clear oil at 750 million, and tea oil at 900 million.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Transactions became increasingly light, with only a small amount of soybean and mung bean transactions specializing in local sales. Prices soared, with Pinghu small grains at 225 million and Pudong rapeseed mung beans at 300 million. Lin Huai Guan raw kernels were at 400 million, and others did not open.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market had scattered transactions yesterday, and prices soared to unprecedented heights. This was because gold and silver prices were skyrocketing, factory stocks were depleted, and the market supply was extremely scarce. However, actual sales in this area were extremely brisk, and public confidence was very strong, so the prices continued to rise rapidly. The Lao Che flour opened at 73 million in the morning and reached a peak of 77.5 million at the noon closing. The Bing Chuan flour opened at 65 million and quickly rose to the 70 million mark near noon.</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Passenger Flights Suspended, Airport Peaceful as Usual</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Neither China nor Central Aviation companies had passenger flights yesterday. In the morning, there were still passenger flights from South China, but because no one contacted them on the ground after arriving over the city, they did not land and flew away. In fact, the airport was as peaceful as usual, and yesterday's suspension was "a case of unnecessary worry." It is heard that the flight personnel of the two companies are prepared to continue working today, and civil aviation flights may resume.</p>

<h3>National Bank Sells 154 Gold Bars, Surge in Gold Market Slightly Dampened</h3>
<p>Breaks the 20 Billion Mark Again in the Afternoon</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The gold market was extremely strong yesterday. Due to the abundance of funds and the increasing ease of cash, investors, seeing the recent tense situation, poured into the financial market, making the market even more chaotic. The rise continued to soar, still creating a situation of demand exceeding supply. The exchange continued to raise the price to 9.5552 billion, once again hitting the upper limit, but there was still no market.

<h3>Exorbitant Retail Prices for Cigarettes</h3>
<p>[China News Agency] The cigarette market was very chaotic yesterday due to the skyrocketing price of gold, with those holding floating capital rushing to buy, making the demand strong. In addition, the supply was small due to the reduction in work, and the resale among businesses was very scarce, creating a situation of demand exceeding supply. The exchange was at a standstill, and prices were not listed. However, there were some transactions outside the exchange, and the market was very strong. Retail prices in cigarette stores were shockingly high. Yesterday afternoon, a pack of 20 Qianmen cigarettes was 3.6 million yuan, a pack of 10 Meili cigarettes was 1.5 million yuan, a pack of 20 Yinhang cigarettes was 2.9 million yuan, and a pack of 20 Hong Gaole cigarettes was 2.3 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Residents Near City Suburbs Flee to Central Districts</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] As the Battle for the Defense of Greater Shanghai gradually enters its climax, residents near the edge of the city are again fleeing to the central area. In Nanshi, Zhabei, Yangshupu, and Hongkou, moving vehicles were constantly coming and going throughout yesterday. They had no definite relocation destination, and most of them were temporarily staying with relatives and friends, while a small number were temporarily renting rooms in hotels. Some were also painfully paying huge transfer fees to rent houses in the Western District. A reporter inspected various small hotels last night and found that most of them were full. The hallways were full of boxes and packages, piled up in extreme disarray.</p>
<h3>Desolate Huangpu River Surface</h3>
<p>Since yesterday, all ships in the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek have been moved to designated locations for mooring, so the river surface is extremely desolate except for the occasional dispatch boat or two. As for the tramways of the French Concession leading to the Bund, they have been rerouted to turn around at Dongxin Bridge since yesterday, while the red public buses turn around at the Great World.</p>
