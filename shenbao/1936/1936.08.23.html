<p>時評</p>
<h3>國選與新聞記者資格問題</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>當今我國各界的人士尤其是我們新聞界最所關心的問題除了北方和廣西的局勢以外大約就是國選了</p>
<p>那未來的一千二百名國民大會代表負有制定憲法選舉元首解救國難的重大的任務他們怎樣的產生出來這的確是値得關心的我們從事於新聞業的入們一則在職業本身上就對政治有着濃厚的興味二則只要加入了合法的新聞記者團體就在這次國民大會比其他各界有着較多的參加機會我們對於國選關心得更其深切也是當然的</p>
<p>國民大會代表選舉法第十九條規定着「參加選舉之職業團體及自由職業團體以在本法公布前依法成立者為限」又第二條規定着「各省職業團體由各該團體之機關職員推選候選人」又附表規定着「新聞記者團體選舉代表十一名」現在全國各省市依法成立的新聞記者團體還寥寥可數參加這類團體的人數對代表名額的比例在全國一切職業團體中問不能不說是很大的了</p>
<p>然而這樣的規定却引起新聞記老的資格問題來因為第一我國的新聞記者在資格上並不像會計師和律師那樣有着法定的標準第二我國新聞記者的團體組織還幼稚得很就那些巳經成立的團體來說會員資格都是限於日報和通信社的記者的大家知道我國的通信社多而且濫只消借一具謄寫版來發幾頁不三不四的新聞就儼然是一個通信社了因此團體方面往往無法拒絕任何假冒的新聞記者的加入同時那些對於時事問題很有分析和批判的能力常給各種定期刋物寫稿的眞正優秀的新聞記者却因為章程上的限制無法來參加團體第三大多數省市還沒有新聞記者團體的組織道次選舉法上關於新聞界方面的規定固然在手續上很方便但是因了上述這三種理由却也不能不說是太過褊狹了</p>
<p>最近南京新聞界同人因為當地新聞記者的團體還未成立的緣故呈請中央及選舉事務所就選舉法上關於新閉界的規定設法補救這種請求當然是十分合理的然而要使全國新聞界在這次國選的參加上感覺到相當的公允在中央方而固然應當就新聞記者的資格標準有合理的規定同時在新聞界方面也應常使團體組織儘量的普及起來健全起來這麽辦却不是短促的選舉期間所能允許的因此權宜的補救辦法只有把選舉法第十九條上「在本法公布前」這幾個字變通一下罷了</p>
<p>我們新聞記者是國民的精神糧食的供給者對於國事也同國民代表一樣有着儘量貢獻意見的責任我們較之一般的國民更可以擺脫對於國民代表的虛榮心理因此選舉法上關於新聞記者的選舉權和被選舉權的規定只要有了相常的變通我們的新聞界該不至於再斤斤計較的吧</p>
<h3>豐台中日軍　誤會案已平息</h3>

<h3>蘇俄開始　充實西方防務　歐洲多事英屬地各增防　英海軍應付地中海局勢</h3>

<p>紐絲綸議會辯論防務計畫、歷一全日、頃已吿畢、兩黨皆以為防務今為急不容緩之圖、而宜與澳政府及英政府合作、以進行共同訐畫、國防部長瓊斯氏宣稱、紐絲綸政府所議之國防計畫、含有依長時期之方案鞏固海防、增撥軍費、維持領袖式之巡洋艦、及改善航空站諸端、並稱、紐絲綸今所支出之防務經費、每人攤派十六光令九便士、澳洲為二十先令、南菲聯邦為十四先令云、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>玉斯美　日本代表今日向太平洋學會發表演說、謂日本不欲孤立、數年後日本尚能恢復其前此國際間之地位、吾人現正在調整內政、英國代表維格倫爵士宣稱、各國恐懼日本貿易之膨脹有如魔鬼、但日本出口貿易之增加、並不如各國報紙及政府當局宣傳之甚、美國前陸軍部長貝克對此表示同意、謂日本國際貿易膨脹之數量並不及他國所想像者遠甚、（廿一國民電）</p>

<p>澳洲錫特尼　昆斯蘭省現正試騐建築橡皮路、所用橡皮、係由新基尼亞運來、建造橡皮費用過鉅、惟試騐如能成功、則此項橡皮路卽將推廣至澳洲其他各地、則將來汽車不必用橡皮胎矣、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本財界政黨　反對電力國營　遞信省改提電力統制案</h3>
<p>（南京）代替現行電氣事業法之運用强化案、或存民有民營之形、以特殊公司之統制强化案等、雖被相當有力考慮、然遞相對此代案、是否同意、殊為疑問、又政友會反對遞相案、固可不問、然民政內部亦有採反對論者、此於遞相之立塲、極為不利、萬一民政黨正式反對時、政府當然不能採用遞相之案、是遞相案之運命、當視民政黨之態度如何以為轉移、惟陸軍當初極力支持遞相案、以電力國營之實現、定為軍部所意圖之確立廣泛的統制經濟之一種試金石、若因財界政黨反對而不能成立時、寺內陸相必斷然反對、始終支持國營案之實現、廣田首相此時必左右為難、（二十二日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）廣田首相與賴母木遞相昨日會談之結果、决定將遞信省之電力國營案改名為電力統制案、作為國策、提交二十八日閣議、據遞相謂、電力國營案之名稱雖變更、然其內容無變、首相為緩和反對者意見並避免誤解起見、有此改名之舉、現在統制電力之方法、除此國營案以外無共他方法、故不論有任何要求、絕對不能變更其根本方針、（二十二日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）二十一日閣議散後開第二次四相會議决定國策之範圍、國策問題之預備交涉以此吿一段落、今後四相會議以國防費為中心、討論明年度預算之編製方針、據聞軍部要求之國防費、陸軍八億元、海軍七億七千萬元、超過本年度之國防費五億五千萬元、然馬塲藏相擬以新財源五億元之中、以一億或一億三千萬元、作為新庶政之國策費、故對於軍部要求之軍　費十五億七千萬元、不得不加以削除、其數最少二億元以上、軍部兩相對藏相方針、並無反對意見、然國防之强化、固為第一國策、其所要經費、不應由一般財源支出、應發行公債以求經費、藏相與軍部兩相關於財源問題、意見不同、故今後四相會議、不免發生難局、（二十二日同盟電）</p>

<p>耶路撒冷　一般人對於伊拉克外長紐利氏之來此間、均極注意、因紐氏在巴力斯坦時、曾與阿拉怕領袖多人、有所會議也、據云紐氏此來、已引起外間之謠傳、謂阿拉伯各領袖、企圖出為干涉、俾巴力斯坦之爭端、可獲解决云、（廿一日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）據今日消息英政府關於西班牙政府近所發表之所謂封鎖命令、並未與德國或意思直接磋商對付辦法、且不以為此項命令乃因西艦干涉德船迦姆倫號而引起關於迦姆倫號之被干涉一案、（英政府自始卽切實聲明、列强應從速商妥决議、使不干涉西班牙內戰協定之要項得收實效、蓋若久事延宕、則戔戔意外事件之發生、卽足使妥協更形困難也、英政府具此觀念、故不待各國一致贊同、卽取片面行動、取銷輸往西班牙之軍火與飛機一切護照、並用種種方法、積極運動各國接受法國之建議、再當西班牙內戰發生之初、英政府卽由其駐直布羅陀與西班牙領海之海軍司令一再警吿對抗之雙方、不得干涉英國船隻、如加干涉、則英國將加抵抗、並另發警吿、如飛機飛過直布羅陀天空、則將先向開槍三響以警之、如仍不改方向、則卽將對準轟擊云、此項警吿、為保護國家利益之尋常手續、並未引起爭案、或碍及不干涉之原則、故德國對於迦姆倫號之受西艦干涉、而忿忿不平、英國深予諒解、所可慰者、德政府迄未正式表示、當該案未經滿意解决之際、法國之不干涉建議應展緩進行也、西班牙政府之封鎖命令、現仍為倫敦與瑪德里間之交涉問題、據有權威之法律家意見、西班牙海軍圖在公海實施交戰國之權力、必待先决條件之成立、而後此種權力始可成法律也、先决條伴之一、為應有公認的交戰狀態之存在、但迄今尚無一國承認西班牙叛軍為交戰團、而衆信西班牙政府亦不欲承認叛軍有此資格、其次、國際公法曾規定封鎖必須認眞、以求其有效、今先决條件長此情形、則一國實不能在公海中實施如檢査種種之交戰國權力也、（二十一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>南京市　舉辦抗瘧工作經過</h3>
<p>南京通信、瘧蚊傳染疾病、患者重則致死、輕則傷身、為害人民、影響社會、所關甚鉅、世界各國、大都均先後舉辦抗瘧工作、我國除為外人管轄之香港外、京市為全國首創、查瘧疾一病、行於我國南部、勢極猖厥、茲就京市而言、根據十九二十四兩年間建造總理陵墓工人四百九十八人中、患瘧病者佔三百五十五人、又二十一年二十二年中央醫院報吿共診治瘧疾病人七百九十八人、內夏秋瘧疾佔三百十二人、此三百十二人中、經醫而不治者、計三十三人、佔全數十分之一有奇、由此推想、卽可知其流行狀况之猖獗矣、南京市政府有鑒及此、遂於去歲二月間、召集關係機關、組織抗瘧委員會、專事抗瘧工作乏推進、無如京市地方遼闊、池塘衆多、市民智識低落、弗能予以直接間接之輔助、是故不能一蹴而躋完善之境、因之抗瘧工作之推進、只能標本兼施、徐達於成、茲將京市抗瘧工作實施槪况、及將來計劃、略述如下、</p>
<p>一、實施槪况　由衛生事務所設衛生稽查三人、伕役十四人、共分三組、每組四人、另二人為特務組、衛生稽查三人、先由衛生實驗處予以抗瘧及實地練習之嚴格訓練、其責職徐監督抗瘧伕役工作外、並任測量繪圖及採集蚊之幼虫、與考核各處成續之職務、抗瘧伕役授以一星期之實施抗瘧工作練習訓練、工作區域、以大行宮為中心點、作一半徑三·一七五里之圓圈、工作區內計有池塘共五百二十三個、面積為二百八十萬餘平方市尺、全區內擇定捕蚊所十二所、均設於棚戶光綫黑暗或飼養牲畜等特殊環境之處、並分全區為六小區，每小區分三小組、每小組由各該組伕役前往實施工作、撈幼虫及捕成蚊、滅蚊藥料係選用巴黎綠（路灰）及抗瘧油兩種、滅蚊方法、（甲）噴射巴黎綠灰及抗瘧油、用百分之一巴黎綠與路灰混合、以噴灰器撒佈於產生瘧蚊池塘之水面上、毒死幼虫、每七日輪迴一次、或用滅蚊油同樣以噴油機噴射水面、使各種蚊之幼虫窒息而死、（滅蚊油價較巴黎綠灰的貴四倍、惟人工方面却節省三十倍、但稻田中不宜適用、故二者應分別使用、）（乙）利用魚鵬呑食幼虫浮萍、亦可使幼虫窒息致死、（丙）芟除水草、凡產生蚊幼虫之地溝、其水畔多生水草為幼虫匿居之所、剷除水草、則幼虫易於殺滅、（丁）塡濬溝渠、蚊之幼虫易於滋生於死水塘溝或坑缸之處、故市內溝渠、應分別塡塞或開濬、使縮小產生蚊虫之水面、及易於水之流通、惟此種工作、須有大量之人力、方可收宏效、故均由工務局及淸潔總隊辦理之、京市地方遼闊、抗瘧工作雖經推廣、尙難普遍全市、往往有機關因未在抗瘧區內、請求衛生事務所恊助工作者、該所無不盡力指導、如孝隆衛敎導總隊，經本年實施抗瘧工作後、成效頗為昭著、</p>
<p>二、將來計劃（甲）擴充工作範圍、以城墻為界、預計下關及城南人烟稠密之處、緣城外三公里之內之地帶、為保護地帶、（乙）死水淸除、京市抗瘧區內之秦淮河死水、與各街巷之太平缸、因限於經費人力之薄弱、未能予以實施工作、及逐處檢查、該所以此種工作、非賴全體市民合作、不克以收宏效、故擬擴大宣傳、以期市民自動使產蚊幼虫之水面縮小、或疏通死水、以達完善之境云、</p>

<h3>德國戰鬥力的估計　（上）</h3>
<p>— 法國X將軍作月祺譯</p>
<p>關於德國軍事力量的問題，已因牠遠背羅迦諾條約和駐兵萊茵河區域重又引起世人的注意。尤其是法國人，每天在報紙上列舉德國的軍隊，坦克車，和飛機的種類及數量。他們比較德國的軍備和本國的軍備，藉以判斷未來戰爭的勝負。這是難怪的，因為，除以和平時期的軍事組織為根據外，普通人大概都不知道從什麽着字纔可以估計任何國家的戰鬥力。</p>
<p>可是，為抗敵作戰，所必需的常備軍，只是交戰國的武力中的一微小部分。戰爭發動後過了若干星期，出征的軍隊已全部開拔，藏在倉庫中的彈藥不久將吿盤，精新完整的飛機已大部分損壤，到這時候，假如任何國家事前忽略後備軍的組織與軍需的補充，忽略運輸的籌劃，忽略便於軍隊調動的道路的開關，則選國家未有不終於潰敗的，雖然在戰爭初期牠曾獲得可驚的勝利。</p>
<p>僅以常備軍為根據而佔計任何國家的戰鬥力，是一種會引起危險的嚴重的錯誤。除認識現有軍力外，我們更應考慮這軍力到了戰爭時期具多大價値，什麽內部資源可藉以維持軍隊，有什麽武力的淵源隱匿着。簡括地說，就是：我們應考慮那國家的整個「軍力可能度」。</p>
<p>這樣，為預測未來戰爭的勝敗起見，我們應該明瞭的不是德國的現有軍備狀况而是德國的整個可能戰鬥力</p>
<p>所以，除計算兵士，槍砲，飛機的數量以外，我們已考查過德國的商情報吿，牠的統計表，牠的工廠决算；我們已計算渦牠的後備的軍力；我們已硏究過牠的經濟組織和人力。從這些考察所得的數字，我們纔能估計德國的戰鬥力，除此以外不是猜測便是虛搆。</p>
<p>問題是：在戰爭時期德國能生存嗎？牠能長期作戰嗎？牠的人力和運輸在戰爭時期發生多大效力？我們所要考察的就是這幾個問題。</p>
<p>為生存起見，為能够作戰起見，人民必須進食。德國的土壤能否供給全國的食料？這是一個第一重要的問題。一九一八年，德國的前綫與後方軍隊曾因麵包缺乏而潰敗。受過敎訓的德國在食糧準備方面進步多少？經濟封鎖是否會引起與一九一八年相同的悲劇？我們就從回答這問題着手吧？</p>
<p>讓我們觀看德國的農產統計。從一九三二年以來，麥的生產已超過消費。同時，麥的輸入只略微低落，輸出則逐日减縮。例如：在一九三三年，德國麥輸入達七七〇，〇〇〇噸，輸出只五三六，〇〇〇噸；在一九三四年，麥入超增至四五〇，〇〇〇噸。</p>
<p>這顯然表示德國正在積極貯藏食糧。在一九三五年一月，德國存麥達四百萬噸—足够維持一年。德國人不忘一九一八年的慘劇；他們不願意再餓着肚子打仗！</p>
<p>再脫裸麥。從一九三三年以來，德國的裸麥生產已足與消費相抵。一九三五年初，德國裸麥儲量達五百萬噸，其中大部分是在一九三五年一月由國外輸人的。一九三二年，德國裸麥輸出超過輸入。至一九三四年，輸入比輸出多二五，〇九九噸；一九三五年一月的裸麥輸入比一九三四年一月的裸麥輸入多八十倍，在同一期間輸出逐月减少。</p>
<p>馬鈴薯在德國本屬生產過剩，但輸入仍有增無减。一九三三年，輸入七〇，〇〇〇噸；一九三四年，增至一一〇，〇〇〇噸。甜菜糖也是這樣。一九三五年的甜菜糖輸入比一九三四年增多五倍，而輸出則大量减少。輸入不因生產過剩而縮减，顯然是努力貯藏的證據。</p>
<p>德國的牲畜產量，足够消費而無剩餘。目前，德國並在努力增加牲畜生產；去年，為產生脂肪所特別需要的猪的產量，比前年增加百分之八。至於可供食用的脂肪，生產不够消費。為彌補這缺點起見，德國正在計畫種植大豆。</p>
<p>這樣，假如在戰爭時受封鎖，德國仍可繼續生存。在各種食料中，牠所缺乏的只是脂肪。德國的農業足够瞻養人民與軍隊。</p>

<h3>證券　九六債破綻漸顯露</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市况經一度上漲、旋卽趨於和平、雖交割祇餘一二日、而形勢極為堅定而平穩、多空雙方之存帳數目雖鉅、大數已於外間自行揮妥、故塲上掉期者、祗餘零數而已、九六破綻已　、而多方尙在堅持、昨日經過、祇上午開盤、因隔日晚盤盲從放空者、而環境並無消思，乃起而抵補、市價上漲二角至五角半、此後卽趨於混沌、忽高忽低、參差不齊、浮沉於五元一角左右、多空雙方掉期、亦頗和平、並無若何傾軋、本月交易、祇餘週一一天、恐亦無多大傾軋矣、市價結果、一致回高一二角至六角、成交總數、共計七百八十六萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於後、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　標紗拋賣轉居多數</h3>
<p>紗市甚疲趨勢衰　、良以海外紗花、狀况不振、兼之國內棉產豐收、棉價看跌、棉紗成本輕鬆、市價難漲、投機者拋賣尤烈、故市盤仍處困境中、但現紗銷路尙堪支持耳、</p>
<p>標紗多頭了結不少</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、近月續繼下降、但形勢益呈平定之局、拍至遠月勿動、二盤以後、各月上落三·四角、市態參差不一、因賡豐大批購進、為額殊巨、大孚·瑞大亦來補空、惟長豐明德大昶潤康多頭一齊斬結、市盤未受重大影響、但大阪三品大跌一元八·九角至二元、結果各月比上日收盤價漲跌一·三·四·五角、午後開盤市况轉昂、有一部份空頭抵補而堅、追至收盤、多頭又來了結、檯面驟鬆、忽見下墮、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌三·四·八·九角、查賣出通記八百包、恒益一千七百五十包、緊與一千三百包、明德一千七百五十包、泰昌一千一百五十包、長豐四千一百五十包、潤康三千二百包、大昶二千四百包、大豐一千包、裕大七百五十包、晋康七百五十包、買進大孚一千九百五十包、裕大八百五十包、賡豐五千四百五十包、瑞大二千四百五十包、元一一千一百包、協成二千三百五十包、生源八百包、同和八百包、一日間最高低市盤列左、</p>

<h3>各路新花次第上市　標花挫跌仍厲　新姚花首批到百四十包</h3>
<p>棉市平疲、形勢益挫、實緣國內棉花豐稔、且各路新棉日漸上市、人心愈弱、寗波新姚花首批已到一百四十包、交解八月期、故碼頭上未曾開價、據云顏色身骨殊為鮮明云、</p>
<p>新花跌勢較為猛烈</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉因南方套賣、而跌十一至十二·磅音、印棉停市、大阪三品花跌四·五角、市塲人心高低不一、但有一部份扒空、近月略漲五分至一角半、　至遠期、以多頭出檔、反趨鬆懈、一盤以後、八月陳花仍無相當辦法、形勢尤虛、而遠期因上日跌風劇烈、大都觀望、朮况呆定、賡豐大量購進、恒益永裕賣空、加碼益夥、結果八月比上日收盤價跌三角、遠期漲跌五分至一角、午後開槃、近月市况平庸、遠期帶品、二盤以後、近月仍平、迨至收盤、聞現棉售價不振、多頭又來出籠、新花猛跌二角半至三角半、查賣出通記四千五百擔、恒益四千六百擔、聚興二千五百擔、裕大三千三百擔、振大二千七百擔、合興五千四百擔、永裕三千八百担、泰昌二千八百擔、潤康七千七百擔、森康二千七百担、福康四千擔、永昌一千四百擔、買進同和二千一百擔、大孚三千擔、大豐三千三百擔、賡豐四千四百擔、愼昌一千一百擔、元一四千二百擔、協成　千擔、生源三千六百担、信誠四千三百担、釜康　千　百擔　　長　　　　　　　　　　　百擔、一日間最高價市塲　　產</p>

<h3>木架花所增獨多　—八月十九日調查—</h3>
<h3>美棉漲後發生反動</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、西部繼續乾早、衆意棉收將减、各月漲二至五磅音、旋利物浦帮賣出、棉農套賣、多頭了給、發生反動、惟日商限價買進、又見回上、就市勢論、頗形呆滯、在國外發展及套賣增加以前、同業暫抱觀望態度、現需平靜、脚地尙堅、紡織品堅而呆滯、海斯德估計本週廠用為二一六、〇〇〇包、利物浦存底為二五三、〇〇〇包、收盤時股市不振、大眾賣出、再度跌落、計現貨跌十一磅音、期貨跌十一至十二磅音、英棉現貨漲九點、期貨漲七八點印棉停市、原電錄左（二十一日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十二日開盤預測、七·八月期白羅溪為二百二十二羅比、跌一羅比、四·五月期白羅溪為二百零八羅比半、跌〇·七五羅比、十二·正月期奧姆辣為一百九十羅比、不動、</p>
<p>三品紗花俱小　二十二日大阪電、三品期紗跌七角至一元九角、近月為二百零八元二角、遠月為二百元、期棉跌五角至六角、近月為六十四元五角五分、遠月為六十二元、</p>
<h3>疋頭　新棉豐收聲中　棉布市况亦受影響</h3>
<p>昨棉布市面、因新棉生產佳訉迭播、紗市首受壓迫、跌風猛烈、棉布唇齒相關、亦吿下挫、其勢尙緩、白貨東疋售盤較之週一、每疋價已下降一角左右、染色布亦跌近一角、惟當令整理印染貨·直貢·嗶嘰·線呢·色丁·花絨·因客幫定貨交解尙須時日、新成交亦較白貨為健、因之市象堪稱穩定、昨東貨細布·細斜·市布·八四布·再跌每疋二分半以外、本廠十六磅粗布·鴻福寶星二牌、每疋跌五分、本廠細布缺乏現貨、售價平平、細斜受西南影響、人氣大衰、粵湘等地均乏大批進胃、而連日浙路寗紹帮走勢漸增、怡和廠輕磅粗布銷路逐見開展、售盤如故、北路津·烟等帮採辦不衰、昨進申新新裕等廠十六磅粗布等貨百餘件、恒豐·光中·綸昌·印花嗶嘰·直貢·印花絨·色丁、江西帮及本街亦俱有採辦云、</p>
<h3>秋冬呢絨價均昂騰</h3>
<p>昨呢絨市面仍佳交易依然暢達、秋冬各貨市勢皆優、出路迅活、而行情亦見上漲、因新貨到申缺乏、人心大都堅固、兼滙票關金穩定、成本加貴、且近接國外機戶來電、毛價原料又漲、致近來申市秋冬各貨價、亦均續漲尤以下檔貨漲勢更烈、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋麥報小　遠期麥供過於求　—結果回小四五分—</h3>
<p>昨日期麥、以現貨形勢緊秀、常開盤之始、本月份籌碼、頗有收回、近期局面尙佳、惟洋麥坎拿大利物沛均見報小、一般人心以國外景况庸俗、進取之心漸懈、而遠期交易、遂有供過於求之概、二三盤賣買、尙形熱鬧、然勢力差堪相衡、僅呈平疲之局、迨收盤本月份出籠見旺、而遠近趨勢、一致呈下辦之象矣、較之前日、八月十一月各小二分、九月份小四分、十月份小一分、十二月一月各小五分、現麥盤面定立、廠胃依然不弱、高中關需胃甚佳、中次漸有剔選之意、頴州車麥仍開五元一角五分、瑤灣洋河蚌埠五河正　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　麥四元　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　元　　　四角二分、全市　　二萬二千包　　新進七千包、阜　進五千包云、</p>
<h3>現銷仍少起色　麫粉尙無回蘇之象</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤、續呈平疲之象、以洋麥報訊、芝加哥好一角左右、坎拿大小二三角、利物浦跌一辦士强、故浮多相繼回出、本月份小去一分餘、惟原料勢形穩健、而洋行方面、逐有採收、致引起業外購胃、遠期交易、遂有囤戶問津、惟廠方本月份籌碼略有收回、而遠期不乏套出、　以調劑近買賣之需胃、故二盤以次、均見平定、但現銷方面、暫欠生色、致終成平庸之局耳、較前日收盤價、八月十二月　各小半分、九月份小二厘半、十月十一月各小七厘半、粉所因日來氣候、已轉涼爽、故自下星期一起、開拍上下午兩市、恢復常例云、</p>
<h3>新糙米到銷兩旺</h3>
<p>昨日客秈客化頗活、本街胃口均貪、尤以新糙米為最多、新糙米除粵帮繼續暢辦外、本街去胃亦香、統市成交糙米六千多包、盡由本粵兩分去、其他各檔機米反不及糙米之活潑、貨主本擬喊高扳售、然以到數見旺、行情難以扳俏、故市價仍與前市相似、統市開出灑西米一千零七十三包、湘米二千三百五十包、溫台米九百七十包、漢糙五千五百包、去路除本粤兩帮外、其他均係零星點綴云、</p>
<h3>食米行市平定</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共祇到十二三號、貸共一千四五百石、本街銷塲平常、包胃大連靑島亦僅辦四百餘包、故市况見定、薄稻厚粳價悉榮辱、杜洋尖及陰變元亦皆乏軒輊、東新共到一千餘石、行情定局、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船二十四五艘、市上名貨云胃白粳羊杜埠秈東新粳呆頓、變元新客尖尙化、薄稻平平、市價白粳高貨平定、中次挺立、羊杜埠客尖及東新粳價形定勢、變元價加幾分至近角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　糯米枝漲十二元　金菜瓜子亦回漲</h3>
<p>糯米枝　因到貨軋缺、昨行方復起抬盤、箱莊高貨竟開至一百十二元、比升十二元、金山元枝亦虛抬四五元、普通貨近三十元、但元枝究屬為數尙多、若銷方觀望不服高價、後市恐防回軟、扁枝較為平定、僅漲近元、蘭竹枝號盤呌升二元、惟聞後批來源或可轉旺、亦有不易過漲之象</p>
<p>金針菜　自回跌一二元後、近日銷路略見活動、粤帮亦有採辦、故號盤堅持、大興菜呌一元半、比升元許、聞號貨尙未肯多開、蓋之貨、身份大都乾燥、有久守之可能、</p>
<p>新黑瓜子　徐魁子最高到過十七元半、最低僅十三元許、茲以到貨漸缺、而號方不肯賤卸、正在堅守中、故趨勢遂見轉機、徐魁子已開十四元、其餘中小式貨亦見緊、</p>
<h3>絲茶　橫濱絲價猛跌廿餘元</h3>
<p>昨日紐約絲市、標準絲近遠期均下跌四分、日絲八三及七五勻度各跌二分、上海絲不動、廣東絲跌一分、橫濱現貨跌二十五元、期貨跌二十七元、致巾埠外銷絲愈趨淸疲、除白廠外、洋莊廠吐及索子絲昨續有成交、且賣方情形、頗覺殷切、故價亦微漲、用戶僅山東黃經等絲、略有售開、市氣亦吿淸呆、</p>
<h3>上半月生絲出口統計</h3>
<p>上海商品檢騐局八月上半月生絲出口統計總數、為一六四九包、父廢絲出口一四六〇包、總共三一〇九包、茲將出口類別列表如後、</p>

<h3>週末兩日　綠茶交易最暢</h3>
<p>昨據茶機業公會報吿、本週綠茶市况較上週為活躍、尤以前昨兩日走銷為暢、內以抽珍為最多、恊和約進七百箱、永興進五百箱、錦隆進二百箱、其他華茶同孚均有零星成交、價自九十元至百十元、各路珠眉交易、計保隆約進四百箱、福時華茶同孚各進一百餘箱、價六十二元至六十八元、又計眉日來走動亦旺、恊和約進一千箱、錦隆六百箱、天裕百餘箱、價自十七元至卅八元、統計全週成交抽珍二千一百五十箱、珍眉三千三百箱、計眉二千三百五十箱、其他暇目貢熙等成交亦不少、平水茶大幫交易仍淸、惟零星珠茶交易約一千六百餘箱、小針眉四百箱、及三號針眉一千三百箱云、</p>
<h3>抽芯珍眉外銷復動</h3>
<p>抽芯珍眉綠茶、近數週來、因摩洛哥戰事關係、銷路非常沉寂、華茶商不得不一再讓價求售、最近已得國外來電需要、英商恰和同孚錦隆等洋行、均大量吸收、屯溪莊貨、交易最旺、昨前兩日成交共達一千四百餘箱、價做開一百零二元至一百零五元、較前又跌七八元、針眉秀眉等花色、去路亦繼續活潑、珠茶售價、尚　穩定、惟大幫一項、美銷轉趨呆滯云、</p>
<h3>統計二十五年七月上海物價指數</h3>
<p>據國定稅則委員會報吿、二十五年七月上海躉售·輸出·輸入物價明講生活費指數與上月比較、一致上漲、其中以輸出所漲較鉅、其餘三種指數之漲率皆無逾百分之一者、輸出指數自民國二十一年一月以來、始終在一〇〇以下、最低曾至二十三年四月之六八·二、年來已漸見回漲、而自法幣施行以來、更步趨上升、至本月已達一〇〇·七、揆其原因、泰半由於農產物價之回漲、蓋年來農產指數已自最低之六六·三（二十三年四月）、而步漲至本月之一一五·九、本月輸出指數之上漲、其原因仍不外此、農產中如麥豆等雜糖、本屆收獲雖大率豐稔、米棉亦有豐收之望、惟其中麥·豆·芝麻·菜子·棉子·棉花等、因海外市况看高、外商大批採辦、價格一致勝踴、結果農產指數猝漲百分之七·六、輸出總指數乃隨之上升、此不僅在我國對外貿易上之物物交換條件較為有利、而於疲莫能與之農村經濟亦不無小補也、至於其他各市躉售物價、近數月來變動亦均平穩、惟廣州物價驟見高漲、五月份指數為一〇二·二七、六月份突漲至一一〇·四九、約漲百分之八之多、蓋自粵桂問題發動以來、廣州毫洋劵千元合國幣之上海匯價、五月份平均為國幣七〇七·一元、六月份平均僅六〇五·七元、毫洋劵之價値已跌落百分之一四矣、（未完）</p>

<h3>自重和自傲</h3>
<p>— 蘭删</p>
<p>人不可無自重心，但切不可有自傲心。</p>
<p>自重與自傲之間，很有許多差別之點，今天想和諸位小朋友談談這個。</p>
<p>自重便是自己尊重自己，尊重的意思，不是四你搭架子，來差這別人指揮別人之謂，乃是對於自己的人格言語　勸思想等等方面，時時存着「光明正大」的念頭，幷有光明正大的表現，無論做一點什麽事情，都賽含乎人情道理，不因此而　凟自己，也不要褻凟別人，這便是自重。</p>
<p>我以為，越是會得自己尊重自己的人，越是會得尊重別人的，因為他能夠設身處地的替別人着想，知道別人也是喜歡尊重自己的，所以彼此之間，總是互相尊重，這不是很快活的一件事嗎？及過來說，如果你褻凟人家，人家也就對你不住，要加倍的　凟你了。所以說，自重不難，要尊重人家而使人家同時尊重你，那纔是自重的最高表現，最美好的收穫。</p>
<p>自傲就不同了。根本只知道有自己，不知道有他人的。自傲的人以為天下只有他自己一個人最好，最是了不起的人物。除了他以外，世界上的人全是壞種。他以為什麽事情他都能做。而且做得比誰都好。（但你要知道，自傲的人多是自誇的，不中聽不足信的。）他看不起一切人類，看輕了一切事業。他自己曉得死要面子，但人家的臉面却完全不顧，任意作踐，侮辱。以致弄到後來，人人切齒，沒有一個人和他相好的，成了一個高傲自誇的孤立的人。</p>
<p>小朋友，自重與自傲的分別是顯而易見的。現在請你自己檢點一檢點，看看你究竟是屬於那一類的人？</p>
<h3>兒童掌故隨談</h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>何晏劃地</p>
<p>何晏七歲時，他的父親早已亡故，他的母親給曹操覇佔着，他跟隨着母親就養在曹操家裏，無奈陷在俗稱「拖油瓶兒子」的地位。他的聰明勝過成入，當時他已有神童之譽。曹操是何等識人的，實在心裏喜歡他，特別地待他和厚，要把他收為假子。何晏也識得曹操的心意，便常在地面上劃一個方框形，處身在這狹窄自限的所在。旁人問他“「你在幹什麽玩意啊？」他便回答道：「這裏邊是何家的屋子，我住在何家哪！」曹操聽得了，便知道這個孩子自有存心，是沒法收服的。後來不久，曹操果然讓他和他的母親回到他們的老家去。</p>
<p>權奸挾勢，親娘失節，身處這等惡劣環境之中，任憑怎樣剛强烈性的丈夫也是莫可奈何的。一個小小年紀的苦孩子却能抱定宗旨，不忘他自身的根本，卓然有所表現，終使對方感到「三軍可奪其帥而匹夫不可奪志」的古訓，軟化下來索性成全了他母子二人；他的志氣是何等地偉大啊！一個乳臭未乾的孩子會把理性去感化一個炙手可熱的巨奸，料得非此不能奏效而遂其孝思；他的識見又何等地高遠啊！現在有一班人苟安於覆巢之下，畏首畏尾地不自振作，但知認賊作父，靦顏事仇，對這七歲的何晏不覺得慚愧麽？</p>
<h3>小黑炭！做影戲的秘密</h3>
<p>— 江毓祺作</p>
<p>（一）小黑炭掛起一幅布幕，裏面裝了一盞電燈。</p>
<p>（二）去請小朋友來看他做影戲。</p>
<p>（三）布幕上出現一隻大獅子，很好看。</p>
<p>（四）揭開布幕一看，秘密便拆穿了。</p>
<h3>一個探險的飛行家</h3>
<p>— 沙鷗</p>
<p>米股霍善是瑞士國一個飛行家。他早年便獻身於飛行事業。他參加過北極探險的飛行；他曾經由菲洲沿着尼羅河，穿過菲洲中部，一直飛到極南的好望角。他是飛越過世界上許多火山的第一人。</p>
<p>當他做飛行學徒的時候，立志要尋訪天涯地角的人間秘密之區，曾經受過許多磨折，吃過許多艱辛。</p>
<p>他在一九二三年到柏林參加北極探險。以每小時九十英里的速度，越過了北冰洋，俯視着過去帶着獵狗雪橇，平均一天跋涉十二英里的步行探險家的遺跡。區立着一座座冰山的尖峯，宛似一朶朵白玫瑰花排列在下面。一條條冰河並流到海裏去。種種奇觀，使他忘記了冰天雪地中的焦慮。</p>
<p>在飛行菲洲的時候，衡過了熱帶天空雷電交通的陣雨的靈層，那時飛機噸然變成了一個溶盆，渾身濕得似落湯雞。他衝破了靈層，飛到一萬英尺以上的高空。在飛機上俯視火山的噴火口，宛似一個大烟囱裏黑烟翻舞。又像個極大的圓劇塲，間歇地噴出濃厚的烟火來。動心駭目，得未曾有。</p>
<p>當那飛機在菲洲，森林的原野低飛的時候，那轟轟似吼的機聲，驚動了無數的土人和野獸。那大羣的野象和　魚驚駭奔走。少見多怪的士人駭為天神下降，哧得漢拜念咒，祈兔災難。使他看了，不覺好笑。</p>
<p>在東菲洲的伽諾地方，他帶了那裏的會長，在他的宮殿上低飛數周，囿囿中的獸類，驚駭得幾乎發狂。酋長的宮女們潮湧而出，在宮庭前仰頭觀看，都嚇得戰　流汗，目定口呆。</p>
<p>小朋友！你羨慕飛行家嗎？那眞是二十世紀風頭最　的天之驕子啊</p>
<h3>日本有些什麽？</h3>
<p>— 董遜</p>
<p>日本是太平洋上的一個小小的島國，伊本國的土地眞小得可以，面積一共只有十五萬二千三百餘方哩。和我國一比，正如一隻老鼠站在象旁邊！可是他們進取的毅力却要比我們强得多；這是値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>從前日本的小學敎師曾拿了許多榛子梨等。東西分給他們的學生吃，同時吿訴他們說：「這些東西好吃嗎？你們要吃榛子到東三省去！要吃梨到山東省去！中國那兒除這些東西之外，還有許許多多的好東西！」小學生自小腦中就深印着「要好的東西便要到中國去」的一句話，無怪長大後更要了不得了！</p>
<p>「日本有些什麽？」你也許要這樣的問。</p>
<p>「日本自己有很多的東西！」我這麽吿訴你，可是目的並不是呌你去搶他們的東西，而祇使你認識他們一下而已，因為我們自已的東西很多，何必還要搶別人的呢？</p>
<p>日本以水產立國，北海道一帶所產的魚數額極鉅，很是著名。（一）</p>
<p>羣馬縣與新瀉縣間的淸水隧道，計有九七〇二米之長（二）</p>
<p>東京市的東京驛，交通匯集，為日本最大都市之車站（三）</p>
<p>富士山是日本的名山，山頂終年積雪，非常美麗。（四）</p>
<p>名古屋市的城樓，在日本算是很有名的古蹟。（五）</p>
<p>奔良市的大佛，大得很，可是和我國山西靈崗的一比，還不及我們。（六）</p>
<p>大阪是日本的土業區，烟突高聳，有如竹林，所出的貨物，大多銷入我國。（七）</p>
<p>京都的絹縫物（八）和長野的生絲，（十）也是日本有名的產物。</p>
<p>滋賀縣琵琶湖，形如琵琶，風景美麗宜人。（九）</p>
<p>靑森縣的萍幕，在日本算是有名的。（十）（一）</p>
<p>北海道東北地方所產的馬，日本人算是有名的。（十）（二）</p>
<p>此外朝鮮所產的牛。（十）（三）和台灣所產的樟腦和砂糖（十）（四）也很有名，可是這幾樣東西都是從我們手中搶去的！也許我們東北的大豆，將來也要劃入他們的名產中去了！</p>
<p>希望小朋友們看了這篇東西以後心中有一個感想，就是「日本人因為有進取心，所以能够發達。」我們若要發達，當然是需要進取心的！</p>
<h3>寫信的常識</h3>
<p>— 吳雄劍</p>
<p>暑期已過去好多天，從前天天在一堂師長和同學，你和他們分別了好久，應該大家通信問候，或報吿一些自己的近况，所以現在我特地把寫信的要點來告訴小朋友們——</p>
<p>寫信封要注意的：</p>
<p>（一）地址要詳細　收信人的住址，應該寫得詳細。如某省，某縣，某街，第幾號門牌，都要寫得明白。我國同名的縣份很多，不寫某省便容易誤寄，不寫某街，某號，郵差往往無從投遞，又發信人應該寫明發信地址，萬一收信人遷居他處，郵差無法投遞的時候，可以退還原處，</p>
<p>（二）字體要淸楚　信封上的地址，最好寫正體字，切不可過於潦草，免得郵差不認識。</p>
<p>（三）日期要寫明　信封上應寫明寄信的年月日，以便收信人，和發信人日後的檢查信的內容要注意的：</p>
<p>（一）格式要整齊　信的格式整齊，一方面表示你的尊敬，又可表示你的鄭重和整齊的精神。</p>
<p>（三）客套要减少　寫備應當避免許多沒有意思的客套，把自己要說的話簡明地寫出來就是，在寫者和讀者都可免掉浪費時聞。</p>
<p>貼郵票要注意的：</p>
<p>（一）黏貼要牢固　郵票上原有一種膠汁，貼的時候，可用水去濕透它。（有的人用舌面的唾沫黏貼，這是很不衛生的；因為膠質　常有微生物附着，舌面接近它，不是要受它的害處嗎？）不過這膠汁歷時長久，或太稀少，黏力薄弱，容易說落。郵務局認為還沒有貼郵費，就擱置不寄；或認為欠資，向收信人加倍受罰。所以貼郵票要注意貼得牢固，最好加點漿糊。</p>
<p>（二）位置要注意　貼郵票要在信封正面的左端上角，旣便郵局人員的蓋戳，又便檢查；而月這也是我們應守的規律。</p>
<p>（三）寄費要核準　平信寄到本國境內各地，每信郵票五分，本埠只要二分。不過，有時信件重量，超過規定的二十格蘭姆重量——大約和兩個銅元一樣重——就要加貼郵資。為了免遺失，或向收信人收取郵資，過重的信件，應當核準寄費。</p>
<h3>回文詩歌</h3>
<p>— 承明</p>
<p>小朋友！我偶然憶得一首回文詩歌。「有詩意的歌調」是應時的小品文字，在幼年讀書的時候，到了夏天的晚間，聚集了許多小朋友們，在庭除納凉，大家齊唱着這首詩歌，而且唱得爛熟，什麽呌做回文詩歌呢？就是顚倒成誦，上下字句音韻相同，共計只有「香蓮碧水勤風凉夏日長」十個字，將這十個字來綴成七言四句，成為二十八字，倒讀之，仍是同樣的字句，一字不差，倒也是一首很有趣味的詩歌呢！現在將這首詩歌照錄如後。</p>
<p>香蓮碧水動風凉，水動風凉夏日長，長日夏凉風動水，凉風動水碧蓮香。</p>
<h3>到學校裏去</h3>
<p>— 毛毛作十歲</p>
<h3>小軍歌</h3>
<p>— 金勻</p>
<p>你放槍，我拿刀，</p>
<p>你拿梭標我開砲，</p>
<p>掮面小軍旗，</p>
<p>走上前綫去！</p>
<p>槍林彈雨我不怕，</p>
<p>飛機大砲我不懼；</p>
<p>我們是小軍人，</p>
<p>我們是小軍人，</p>
<p>為國家，為民族，</p>
<p>自願作犧牲！</p>
<p>為自由，為平等，</p>
<p>不做奴隸做主人！</p>
<p>恢復舊山河！</p>
<p>高唱得勝歌！</p>
<p>奮勇，前進！</p>
<p>奮勇，前進！</p>
<h3>高爾基給七歲小友的一封信</h3>
<p>— 王鬥　湯美</p>
<p>一九一〇年十一月，當俄國大文豪托爾斯泰逝世後不久，就有一個年紀祇有七歲的小朋友，各呌E．A。驅倫凱　；寫一封信給瑪克辛，高爾基，信上說：</p>
<p>『親愛的高爾基先生：</p>
<p>現在，俄羅斯的大作家，只死　您一個了。所以，現在我請求您，好不好多寫些有趣味的宜話呀信呀給我們。</p>
<p>您的七歲的小友福倫凱爾敬上』</p>
<p>高爾基收到了這封信以後，便很高興的寫了一對如下的回信：</p>
<p>『新愛的　倫凱爾君：</p>
<p>是呀，托爾斯泰的「人」固然是死了，可是拿「偉大」的作家「精神」說起來，却還是活着的哩！他永遠是跟我們在一塊兒的啊。</p>
<p>再過幾年，您的年紀大了些，您自己便可以讀到托爾斯泰的偉大作品了。這時候，您一定會非常高興，同時您也會知道托爾斯泰的「精神」的確沒有死，而且永遠是跟您在一塊兒的！因為他的藝術會給予您一種力量。</p>
<p>親愛的福倫凱爾君：我再把那優秀的作家呌柯羅倫可的作品推薦給您。請您爸爸把他的那　呌「守鐘樓的老人」的故事讀給您聽。</p>
<p>謝謝您的來信。您所要的童話現在寄給您；還有三張「加下里」畫片也寄給您。</p>
<p>高爾基覆於加卜里』</p>
<h3>國王與牧童（五）</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>「噴嘖嘖！」他很羨慕似的讚嘆着，嘴上好像吃着最甜蜜的糖一樣，嘖嘖有聲，接着又道：「嘖嘖嘖！」</p>
<p>同在這一天晚上，到了上牀安睡的時候，那黃頭髪的華樂，把他的臉貼緊在冰冷的窗極上，神往似的呆望着外面藍黑色的天空。他想到了那獨坐在小山裏的那個牧童，不知不覺的起了一片妒羨的心，因為那小王渴想着要到外面的黑夜中去，瞧那世界是多麽的神秘呀！他心中暗暗地想那平日在白天裏所見的一切東西，不知道到了夜晚是怎麽樣的？</p>
<p>他旣爬到了那溫軟的金牀上去，他的母后進來道一聲晚安，他便投身在伊的兩條玉臂之間說道：「呀，母親，我今天做了好多可怕的功課。」</p>
<p>母后忙和伊的兒子親着嘴，柔聲說道：「可憐的小華樂！」</p>
<p>小王繼續下去說道：『咦，母親，今天我在那邊小山又瞧見了一個很可愛的孩子，你瞧他不是很幸運嗎？母天他什麽功課都不用做，只須陪伴着一羣羊在外面玩。母親，像可能也弄幾頭毛色潔白的好好的羊來玩玩嗎』</p>
<p>他的母后答道：『華樂，那些羊並不是當做玩具一般弄着玩的。看羊實在也是一種責任，正和你做功課一樣。』</p>
<p>小王忙道：『母親，看羊也算是責任嗎？那末我寗願看羊，不願意做功課的，但是那孩子當眞是一個牧羊的嗎？我瞧他正和我一般年紀，母親，我可能不能也做一個牧人呢？』</p>
<p>母后道：『華樂，你實在也是一個牧人，不過你並不看羊，而是看顧百姓的罷了，我願你做一個良好的國王，因為你是我的兒子，連我做母親的也有光榮呢。</p>
<p>小王又道：『母親，我很願意一試，做一個良好的國王，但是我却也願意到外面去做一個合適的牧羊人。母親，我並且要請問你，我可是要常常戴着這一頂王冠嗎？這東西實在太重了，好像在那裏咬我的頭額一樣。』</p>
<p>母后答道：『是的，吾愛，你是要常常戴着這王冠的，你要知道這王冠就是表示你自己做着國王，什麽都不能給你自己作主的。此刻你且去安睡，夢中就當作你在做一個牧人，而在寒冷的風雨中抖顫着，那末你醒回來時瞧見自己躺在金床上，就會快樂而滿足哩。』</p>
<p>但那黃頭髮的小王華樂並不因他母親的勸慰而變動他的心理，放聲嚷着道：『我很願像到外邊的風雨中去，這門內的窒塞的空氣，委實使我厭恨極了。』</p>

<p>小小專著</p>
<h3>報紙與社會倫理</h3>
<p>— 馮有辰</p>
<p>我們展開報紙來一看，就有許多政治的，經濟的，社會的新聞映入我們的眼簾，這些新聞都是我們所生活的現實社會的產生，都與我們的生活有密切關係。我們閱讀報紙，不僅可以使我們知道現今世界發生了些什麼事情，而且能使我們在日常看報中綜合各種新聞，知道一般政治經濟和社會的形勢，因而更可正確地確定自己應該如何生活。有人說：「現代的報紙眞是日常不可缺少的一個生活必需品。」這話並未有絲毫誇大的地方。我們可以說：在保護我們的身體生命的存在上，衣食住是必需的；在智識的獲得和進步上，報紙是必需的。</p>
<p>報紙對於人類旣然是這麼重要，那它的機能又是怎樣的呢？有些人都以為報紙的機能是在於死板地記載新聞；說報紙是照射社會現象的鏡子，它必要常常地將一切社會現象照原狀地照出來；此外它是什麼也不做的。這樣的說法，一看倒好像陽很不錯的樣子，但仔細考究起來却是非常機械的論調。首先，報紙的新聞並非自然地跑到報紙上來的，而是經過了新聞記者的選取，經過了報館的採納，才出現於報端的，換言之，這中間卽有個人的或集團的主觀作用。其次，讀者閱讀報紙並不是讀後就算了事，報紙上的新聞必要在他們的腦舺中活動，因而必要影響到他們個人主觀的意見和生活；如果報紙的讀者是生活於社會中的，他們個人主觀的意見和生活必要對客觀社會生影響，那麼，報紙對一般讀者所起的作秀也就是它的社會作用。這樣，由新聞的採取和刋載到報紙發出後對於個人及社會的影響，都可充分表明報紙實有極大的能動作用，它並不是一面死的鏡子。</p>
<p>亞沙·布里斯本說：「……僅認報紙是單純的印刷反射鏡，是不對而且有危險的。」因為如果只是把報紙認為是一面死的鏡子，那所有一切新聞的記載便都是機械地鏡子的照射，報紙本身卽毫無責任可言，這便消除了報紙的能動作用，取消了它重大的社會任務，當然是很危險的。</p>
<p>在報紙一般的社會作用中，除政治的作用外，最重大的便當是它對於社會道德，倫理的影響。我們看，報紙的社會新聞多半是與社會道德，倫理有密切關係的。如欺詐，盜竊，通姦，謀殺，毀人名譽，違背信用等類的新聞都是，因此，每一個報紙便當積極地担負起它重大的社會任務來，在刋載那一類的新聞時，必要嚴加考慮，必要使刋出的新聞不會對於社會倫理，個人道德起壞的影響，以發揮新聞本身的敎訓的能動作用。就這一點上說，在中國許多報紙中只有申報要算最好。但有些報紙只知道迎合一般社會的不良傾向，對於男女私通情殺一類的事，不僅特別大號紅字刋登出來，而且還加以肉麻的描寫，不正確的評判，以助長不良傾向的發展，把社會引向到墮落，頹廢的方面去。在日本曾發生過這樣的事：當有島武郎情死事件發生時，卽有一些報紙利用他的社會地位，將這事件誇大的刋出，並對情死行為加以讚揚，以圖迎合社會的不良傾向，這結果便引起了許多人的猛烈攻擊，說那是迎合一部分讀者的低給趣味的表現，對於社會風氣是只有惡影響。同時，在中國也有過這一類的事情，如着名電影明星阮玲玉的自殺，在她主觀的感覺中便是為的「人言可畏」；自然，我們不能依據這一點便說她自殺的主要原因，卽是在於一般與論或新聞對他的戀愛糾紛之不正當的宣傳，在於她的畏懼人言；那是應該歸之於社會制度的不良的；但當阮玲玉的戀愛糾紛案發生時，有些報紙的記載確是很誇大而且不正確的，因此，「人言可畏」這話却也並非毫無根據；同時，就在她自殺後，有些與論也不是公平的：這些誇大而不正確的記載，這些不公平的與論，不僅對阮玲玉個人有損害，而且，對於社會道德也起了極不好的影響。——這兩件事情，便可充分證明報紙對於社會道德有積極的作用，而有些報紙却是有意或無意地在它的表現上對社會道德起了壞作用的。</p>
<p>美國前大總統哈定對於新聞道德七法則的實行曾說過這樣的話：「假使我今日起草新聞道德的法則，除對於社會以警戒的塲合外，還要禁止一切不道德事實的報告……」但我們以為：絕對禁止記載一切不道德的事件，也與那些誇大而不正確的記載同樣，是很不對的。因為一切不道德的事件都是現實社會的產物，如果只記載被現實社會認為「道德」的事件，而不記載不道德的事實，那在客觀上便是在為現實社會遮醜，在為它歌功頌德。問題不在於記載或不記載一切不道德的事件，而是在於如何記載法。比如有一位達官貴人的姨太太，因為不願過那種墮落，頹廢的姨太太生活，從那富貴的家庭中逃了出來，甚至去與她的情人同居：對於這樣的事情，我們就不能在記載中亂用什麼「私奔」，「淫婦」一類的字眼，更不應將其個人的戀愛事情當作一般淫亂事件來描寫而斥之為不道德：因為那在客觀上是贊助達官貴人娶大批的姨太太，蹂躪女性，是在擁護姨太太主義，是在實際上反對男女平等，婚姻自由，是在把社會向着黑暗，墮落的方面引去。</p>
<p>現代的新聞事業已經成了資本主義社會中巨大的產業；因此，有許多報紙也和一般產業組合一樣，其第一目的即在營利；至於道德任務，社會作用，那是被放在營利目的之下的。前倫敦「泰晤士報」記者斯基德氏曾說：「製作，販賣近代的報紙所必需的莫大的資本，大工塲，複雜的機械和組織，可說已經把報紙從「職業」發展到了「產業」的地步。新聞記者必須寫出其所不願寫的許多實業家或大股東們的所欲者。今日報紙弊害最壞的徵修之一，實在，就是忽略編輯的方面，重視營業的方面」。這對於資本主義最發達的歐美的一般報紙確是極正確的批評。那些地方的報紙可說都在大金融家和企業家支配之下，只知道去迎合他們的愛好，根本就不管道德不道德；如最近歐美有些報紙，在帝國主義和軍火商支配之下，甚至公然鼓吹擴張軍備，發動戰爭：這就是站在一般人道主義的立塲上說，也是極不道德的，然而它們却是那樣做了。</p>
<p>當然，所謂道德與不道德，並沒有一定的標準：在自由主義者看來，大小姐不得家庭同意而與人戀愛甚至同居，是極正當的，因為大小姐的戀愛原是她自己的事情，用不着家庭來代管；但在富於封建思想的人看來，那却是不孝不貞的淫亂行為。像這一類的足以表現街道觀念的差異的問題，在現今社會中實在多得很。然而，不管怎樣，報紙對於一般的道德問題總當取一定的態度；如果一國的報紙是為國家民族，為多數國民而存在的，不是為少數特權者而存在的，那道德標準的確定便當依據國家民族的利益，依據多數國民的道德觀念。通常所謂報紙是人民的公僕，便應該是這個意義。</p>
<p>斯登曾說：「現代的報紙是正在從機械化時代，報導時代，資本時代向第四時期的社會公僕時代轉移着。就是說，報紙已經不是過去所稱的「社會之木鐸」，是應該用它的龐大的組織和堅強的機械力去給廣汎的社會做公僕……這個公僕的意義就是為社會服務，就是給大眾服務；……」在這個報紙應該做廣汎的人羣的公僕的意義之下，我們希望國內許多頗有希望的報紙都努力去消除低級趣味，放棄不公平的道德批論，盡量反映廣汎的人羣的一般要求，以獲得廣大的讀者。自然，低級趣味是有閒的老爺老太太們所愛好的，但這些人究竟是少數；報紙要增廣銷路，只有與多數人結合，以日益前進，日益改善其內容。我以為中國有些報紙實在是太老氣橫秋了，太商品化了，在各方面都無進步的新氣象；假使在這時有這樣的報紙出現；卽無論內容和形式，無論言論的觀點，記錄新聞的立塲和筆調，排版的形式，……都與那些完全商品化的，老氣橫秋的報紙不同，都能表現出全新的進步傾向，那在中國報界或文化界中便必然會起大的哄動，而它的讀者的質與量方面也就必然會超出那些落後的報紙之上了。</p>

<h3>評「迷途的羔羊」</h3>
<p>— 浣蒲女士</p>
<p>在時髦新鮮的「兒童年」，無論在報紙上或集會的演說中，所見所聞的大多是「歌功頌德」的文字。大家都把「現實」踩在脚下，而熱轟轟地開了什麼「兒童敎育用具展覽會」哪，「兒童玩具展覽會」哪……又特製「兒童電影片」，還說要「開兒童銀行」……由名人提倡在前，唱合者効命於後，浩浩蕩蕩，全中國兒童似乎一步就登上了「天堂」！然而油彩塗不了汚跡，事實勝於雄辯，街頭巷尾的一般兒童，在這熱鬧的「兒童年」中，究竟得了一點什麼「恩惠」？「迷途的羔羊」在編着方面便大胆地把握住了這一不合理的「現實」！</p>
<p>「迷途的羔羊」一揭幕便是大家在「兒童年」中　得最好聽的「兒童敎育」。那蒙童館中老師的昏庸，設備的簡陋，都是大家所認為要不得的吧，然而在全中國農村中的兒童，不都還是在那裏受着所謂「學校敎</p>

<p>談到這裏，大家也許會說城市中的兒童比較地能受到一些較好的敎育。那末，我們且看看小三子罷，他在都市堂皇的學校中字會寫了，書會唸了，然而習染下來的偷竊惡習都不能改。再看看小　子的同學們，在那樣幼小的年紀便刁鑽，古怪，對於貧者弱者沒有絲毫的了解和同情，試問這種敎育對於當今的兒童倒底有什麽用？以「訓誨愚蒙」自居的校長敎師，終於覺到了自己的敎育之無能，然而不加硏究，不求改良，只呌學生自己退學，試間道種校長和敎師對於現時的兒童又有什麽用？…可是，只要我們舉目一看，這樣的學校，這樣的辦敎育的人，却整個地「肩負」了中國兒童敎育的責任」！</p>
<p>「迷途的羔羊」在演出方面以「對比」來顯示了鐵一般的「現實」，這是最巧妙的技術，最有効的方法。一羣無父無母，無衣無食，為社會所唾棄的兒童，他們也和其他的嬌貴孩子們一樣地要求着肉體與精神上的安愚呀！養份又足，形式又美的餅乾和糖果擺在他們的眼前，然而隔了一層透明的玻璃，使他們可望而不可卽！合於兒童心理的玩具，富於兒童敎育意茂的用品，陳列在他們的眼前，山笨兒的口替全體窮孩子們呼喚：「我也要那馬呀！』可是除了大雪夜的寒風之外，誰來聽他們的呼喊？誰來滿足他們的要求？「凡是兒童都應來看」的敎育電影，却把「正是兒童」的他們這一羣擯諸門外，給守門的警察以大棒法威嚇。至於為「兒童敎育儲金的銀行」，當然更不是為他們設立的了！</p>
<p>這一大段對比的地方，將大衆的目光對正了「現實」，不單給人以强烈的刺激，還給人以很深刻的記憶。</p>
<p>除此以外，「迷途的羔羊」還用對比的方法證明了階層的對立。</p>
<p>從沈慈航下鄉放賬後回上海時，不許捎帶流落無依的小三子，而給老僕藏起來帶走起，一直到老僕喊出了：『這個世界上還有公理嗎？』而憤然丟棄了原有的飯碗，　着小三子走出沈慈航的大門，租了一間小茅房，收留了大雨夜的那一羣無吿的孩子止，階層的意識是如升階梯似的，越來越明顯，越來越深刻。沈慈航歸家做壽時，衣香花影，賓客滿堂，但有誰注意到窗外偷立着的那一羣饑餓的孩子？只有窮苦的老僕將剩餚殘羹偷給他們吃。餓昏了的小三子跌倒在貴人的大理石（？）的階下，半天沒有人理，還是由他拾垃圾的同伴「小蹺嘴」來救護起去。小三子在沈慈航家遭了寃枉而被逐時，一般沒良心的走狗都「助紂為虐」，只有又老又窮的老僕激於義憤，發出了：「這個世界上還有公理嗎？」的吶喊，而毅然不顧一切携了小三子出走。大雨夜，家家的門戶都緊閉了，誰來管街頭巷尾那如落湯鷄似的又冷又發抖的窮孩于們？只有又苦又窮的老僕將他們收留起來。一般人也許會說「上天有眼」，倒底有「好人」吧，然而「好人那裏？不是窮人才了解窮人的痛苦，才重視窮人的痛苦，才同情窮人的痛苦。才設法來慰藉窮人的痛苦嗎？有錢的人，吃飽了飯不是「鬧戀愛」，就是「想兒子」，不是鈎心鬥角想敲他人的竹槓，便是設宴辦壽以顯示自己的輝煌，他們不屑於來過問「也是一個人」的窮人們的痛苦，實際上他們住在「天堂上」也不懂得窮人的痛苦，所以他們决不會伸出一隻手來助以一臂之力的！卽使有，那也不過是如沈慈航一樣，將窮人的「屍體」拿去墊高他自己的社會地位罷了！</p>
<p>可是，一部藝術作品，要牠臻於最上乘，完全沒有一點瑕疵，似乎也很難的。「迷途的羔羊」在意識方面有如此的强調，在一些瞭解不够的觀衆看來，不免要陷人一般人激於義憤時所常犯的「英雄主義」的錯誤。如老僕看見小三子遭寃枉，憤然地把他帶了出來，想以僩人的力量去救護他；在大風雨的夜裏，看見窮孩子們無家司歸，激於人類的同情，把他們收留進來，又是想要以個人的力量來救護他們：這在他的本身固然是應該有的舉動，可是事實的本身却毫沒有結果。他敎他們：不要偷竊，不要偷懶，要努力作工，然而，失業的大口却把他們吞歿了！到後來，孩了們雖欲實行他的敎訓：「不要偷竊」向終究不可能，饑餓驅使了他們，終於又「犯偷竊」了！</p>
<p>此外，全劇的　傷氣氛太重，尤以老僕的結局形成了「不過如此」的悲觀的塲面！為「公理」而犧牲了飯碗，為「救救孩子們」而流為乞丐，結果還是只有給凍餓吞蝕了老弱的生命！知道要過「人」的生活，必須奮鬥的人們，當然不會受這一結局的影響，然而意志薄弱的或許竟會因此而灰心也說不定呢。</p>
<p>可是借了孩子們的口，說出了大家欲說而又不敢說的話，欲唱而又不敢唱的歌，這一段悲劇却有了巨大的功效！</p>
<p>在技術方面，幕幕的取材都非常適當，開首的幾幕實在精美，不失為藝術的鉅製。光綫也很調勻，可惜音樂的旋律和劇情的進展不能一致。</p>
<p>主角小三子是很賣力氣的，然而他的性格的表現似乎因了戲劇而破壞了他的一致，最初是個有些怯懦的孩子，中途又帶傻氣，而最後却又成為一個很勇敢健全的孩子了。</p>
<p>鄭君里的老僕，實在覺得可愛。</p>
<p>黎灼灼的沈太太，極盡其都市中姨太太之能事，在暴露都市罪惡的那一段中，因了她的表演而史加有力。</p>
<p>沈白寗的沈慈航和沈太太的姘頭，實在太「蹩脚」了，有些地方因了他們的笨拙而减色不少。</p>
<p>其他的配角都還能恰到好處。</p>
<p>總之，「迷途的羔羊」是値得介紹於大衆之前的。在一九二六年的這「兒童年」的時代，能够以兒實的事來針對「現實」，批論「現實」，並且將「現實」一段一片擺在大衆之前，「迷途的羔羊」的演出，似乎還是創舉。</p>
<p>有人說「迷途的羔羊」沒有故事，沒有結局：但農材的破產，農民的流亡，帝國主義壓迫下所發生的失業，工廠商店倒閉，資本家的陰謀以及他們私生活的腐敗，在現代進展的歷史上不都是最有意義的故事麽？至於「迷途的羔羊」的結局，本來不是劇作者的事，收拾這個塲面的應該是觀戲的我們，躱在危險的髙樓上的孩子們不是正等待着我們去救援嗎？</p>

<h3>奧林匹克運動會小史</h3>
<p>— 體仁</p>
<p>自八月二日以來，我們卽每天在報紙上看到「第十一屆奧林匹克運動會」的字樣，現在這運動會雖已閉幕，但關於它的各種消息却還在報紙上繼續出現。這樣一來，我想只要是看報的人，對於「奧林匹克」這幾個字都必然是有極深刻的印象的；所謂「奧林匹克運動會」大家也必然會知道那就是「世界運動會」的意思。但「世界運動會」為什麽會被稱為「奧林匹克運動會」呢？它過去的歷史又是如何呢？這却不是三言兩語所能說明的。</p>
<p>所謂「奧林匹克」（Olympic），本是希臘一個地方的名稱；以前希臘國民每隔四年卽要在這地方舉行主神大祭，並在神前舉行運動·文學·音樂等各種競技，這便是奧林匹克競賽會的起源。不過，這種競賽會還是古代祭神的一種表示，並沒有近代運動大會的意義。後來隨着資本主義的發展，各國體育運動的進步，這樣的祭神式的奧林匹克競賽會才在近代的意義和形式之下復興起來，成為了世界運動大會。這個發展的事實是這樣的，卽一八九四年六月十六日，世界各資本主義國家在巴黎開會，决定依照希臘古式，每隔四年舉行世界運動大會一次。自這次决定以後，卽於一八九六年在希臘京城雅典開第一次世界運動大會，這便是世界奧林匹克運動大會的起始；至於世界運動大會之被稱為奧林匹克運動大會的依據，那當然就是這個歷史事實了。</p>
<p>近代奧林匹克運動大會的最先發起人是法國人古柏丁。本年第十一屆大會開幕時，奧林匹克國際委員會全體委員曾聯名上書諾貝爾和平獎金委員會，請以本年度和平獎金贈與古氏：同時，古氏自己也說過：「奧林匹克運動會的恢復，在近代生活狀况之下，每四年使世界各國民衆集聚一次，信賴和平與禮讓的競賽，可以組織國際主義的無上形式」；又說：「奧林匹克觀念進至何種程度，常難判斷，但從其發軔的各方面觀之，其定義之深，已很明顯：」，創造並增增强文明國家和平聯絡的友誼關係。二　澄淸並消滅競　運動中之自　與　　的手段，等求人人能得公正判斷的遊技，並使競賽不是以勝利作靑年的歡樂」。這樣，奧林匹克運動大會倒好像是和平的象徵似的。但在實際上，它的起源就已充分表現了資本主義的自由競爭精神的；揭開奧林；匹克運動大會的歷史來看，那一次的天會沒有表現出列强體育競爭的對立呢？至於各國為了在各屆大會中戰敗他人，「為國爭光」，那更是不知道濫費了好多精力和金錢，本年在柏林開的第十一屆大會，是希特勒宣吿開會的；在各種競賽中各國的競爭情形並不亞於它們的政治軍事的鬭爭：而秘魯與奧國足球競賽的糾紛甚至引起了美洲與歐州的對立，表現出了資本主義國家間的矛盾和仇恨。依據這些史實，奧林匹克運動大會實無和平意義可言。至於「競賽不是以勝利作靑年的歡樂」這句話之對於世界運動大會，那更是誰都知道，完全是相反的意義。</p>
<p>奧林匹克運動會卽是隨着資本主義之發展而出現的，它所表現的旣是各國體育運動的競爭，那它各種競賽的成績，當然也是隨着產業之發展，競爭勝利思想之發達而日益進步的。從一八九六年在雅典開的第一次大會起，直到最近在柏林開的大會止，經過了四十年的時間，開過了十一次大會，就中每一次的競賽都有最髙新紀錄發表，各種競技的成績都是一次髙一次的。現在，為使讀者更加明瞭這種發展形勢起見，我們可將四十年前第一次奧林匹克運動會的陸土各重要競技的記錄舉出來—</p>
<p>一百公尺　一二秒　四百公尺　五四秒二</p>
<p>八百公尺　二分一一一秒　千五百公尺　四分三三秒二</p>
<p>髙障得　一七秒六　跳髙　一米八一</p>
<p>撑竿跳髙　　米三〇　跳遠　六米三五</p>
<p>三級跳遠　　米七一</p>
<p>這便是當時陸上各重要競技的最髙成績。但是，如果把它與這次大會的記錄比較起來，那便顯示得非常貧弱了。在這次大會中田徑賽的最髙記錄是：一百公尺—十秒三（美國歐文思）；四百公尺—四六秒五（美國威廉姆）；八百公尺—一分五二秒九（美國伍特羅夫）；千五百公尺—三分四七秒八（紐約夫洛克）；　　　三級跳遠　　　　　　　　　　　人）；由這個此較看來，當可知道世界各項體育競技進步之速了。</p>
<p>拿國家來說，也是資本主義最發達的國家在每屆大會中佔優勢的。如美國，差不多在每次奧林匹克運動會中都獲得了許多競技的冠軍，大有壓倒世界的氣慨；這正如它的資本主義之發展在世界各國之上一樣。</p>
<p>最後還須叙述的是第六次奧林匹克運動會因上次世界大戰而停止了，直到一九二零年大戰年吿終才接著舉行，說者皆謂這是帝國主義的軍事鬬爭代替了它們的體育運動競賽的表現。這次大會决定下屆大會於一九四零年在東京舉行，但就目前國際形勢看來，恐怕它有遭到與六次大會同樣命運的危險。</p>
<p>旅行一週</p>
<h3>太湖之遊</h3>
<p>— 樹蘋</p>
<p>是今年春假的時候，同了五六位朋友在蘇州玩了兩天。那織細柔靡的蘇州，有的是紅桃錄柳，有的是跑得很慢的馬車，有的　嬌小艷麗的女郞，山是那樣低秀，水是那樣迂緩，天氣哩，是懶洋洋的太陽與和風。我們粗野慣了的性情楚不合這粉紅色的桃汁的浸潤的，所以多感到有　疲乏和厭煩，要想開擴開擴胸襟，到那鄙靜草莽中去。可是有勇氣的只有我和季　兩人。我們帶着了很少的用資，憑着手中的一幅地圖，孟浪地出發到太湖去了。</p>
<p>在蘇州胥門外搭了到太湖山下東山鎭的小汽划，上午九時動身。所謂汽划，也不過在普通帆船的前頭加上一個機頭。江南內河的航行多半是　　。船行很慢，每小時不過十餘里，同岸上的人走得差不多一樣慢。我們並不急急地要船走得快，因為兩岸景色是要待慢慢地鑑賞的。有橫塘，西施採蓮的地方：有石湖，就是一石魚湖似洞庭夏水欲滿君山靑」的石湖；有靈　山，吳王建館娃宮和鼓零臺的所在。兩岸都是碧柳桃花，走不多遠又是澄消碧絲的湖沼，恰合「日出江花紅似火，春來江水綠如　」兩句話。小的木船，載着農夫農婦到田裏去作事，種稻，採桑。有名的鴛鴦烏就出產在太湖附近，牠們在岸上的柳蔭中給你唱歌，船上的旅客倒頗不寂寞。在這春的自然的陶醉之中，我們已不知不覺到了東山。</p>
<p>日影西斜了，正是下午四時左右。在東山還看不見太湖，只能看着三四里以外的一座大山。這山呌做莫釐山，上有峯名莫釐峯，田東山到莫釐，要經過山脚下的殿前鎭。我們步行到殿前時，已是五時了。沿着小徑，攀着葛藤，一氣就爬上了莫釐。這是東洞庭山上的最髙峯。一片汪洋呈現於眼前了。剛要消逝的斜陽還殘留着絲絲的紅暈，瀉在廣闊的湖面，映出金黃色的魚鱗，二三漁舟，也漸漸靠着湖邊歸宿了。偌大的湖泊，只剩着偉大，沉默。</p>
<p>腹中感到十分饑餓了，荒野的山是找不着食物的。進莫釐廟去，硬要和尙把鍋裏的冷飯給我們吃。他無奈，只好讓我們狼呑虎嚥了。我們的目的是要連夜渡過太湖，到那湖中的西洞庭山去。那山上有個苞山，上面的和尙是我們的老鄉，在蘇州就打聽好了的。於是把變足並在一塊，順着懶斜的山坡梭下去。坡上有楊梅，有松樹，有桃有李，有枇杷。正是各種果實成熟的時候，可是天色已經傍晚，也無心去摘取　無主的桃李了。</p>
<p>太湖中所有各村莊都是依山傍水地分佈着，上半山是荒寂無人的。我們到了一個鎭，不知呌做甚麽名字。裏面的姑人小孩都出來了，犬更向我們亂吠。他們大驚小怪的指東說西。圍集在我們身邊的人可越來越多了。話是一句不懂，問路也無從問起。他們當我們是漁人，我們却把這兒當作桃花源了。可是他們並不「迎至其家，設酒殺鷄作食」，只是向我們驚訝。一直走到湖邊，想達到我們的目的。招了好久才來一隻小船。要那人載我們到西山，問他要多少錢，他只是搖首，不知是時間太晚他不去呢，抑或夜間湖上根本不能渡給，我們總不明白。看看金黃的太湖，茂密的森林，圍着我</p>
<p>大上海風光</p>
<h3>摩天樓上乘風凉</h3>
<p>— 重</p>
<p>上海第一特區的跑馬廳前，矗立着靜安寺路上的二十二層國際大飯店。為了是東亞唯一的高建築物，所以被稱為「摩天樓」。落成到今，可算是名聞全國的了。只是為了它太高貴華麗，往往使「平民」層的人有些望而却步，不免只成為少數有產者消閒遊樂之地。所以它的無限風光，許多妙處，知者便極少了。前幾天，筆者得到一位朋友的携帶，公然能以布衣而登堂入室，穿房過戶，把摩天樓的內容走馬看花地參覜了一趟，並在二十一層上面，乘了好久的風凉。</p>
<p>現在我先說這二十一層吧。當我剛進了這飯店，和朋友走到電梯裏面，我想，不知道電梯要走多慢呢？誰曉得不到一分鐘，電梯門一開，司機已請我們出去，說是到了。我便悄悄問那位嚮導朋友，他說：『這電梯開得極快的時候，每一秒鐘要走三百尺。二十一層算甚麽？』說着他便領我從二十一層扶梯邊走過去，指着那電梯發動機器問給我看，別的不甚明白，但一眼望去，只那無量數一束束的電綫縈廻繚繞，便已使人嘆為奇觀了。為了地基的關係，二十一層空地並不大，不過二十幾尺見方的一洋台式的瞭望台，上面蓋着二十二層最髙處，據說現由救火會派員駐紮以備瞭望。東南西三面都嵌着厚玻璃，橫闊的二十尺，髙的十尺。上海全市和附近各縣屬都可收入眼底。東邊望去，看得淸楚浦東的林立烟突，川沙縣的大陸以及茫茫的東海；向南望去可看見蜿　的滬杭甬鐵路過松江的大橋和黃浦江上游風景，並可看見著名的中國天主敎聖地，松江余山。向西望去，京滬路同樣歷歷在目，一層層的靑碧田　，蛛網式的河浜港汶，漫無涯際，直　崑山左近，視綫才被擋阻。秋雲朶朶，錦霞片片，令人心曠神怡，知置身嫦娥宮闕。玻璃窗為避免危險起見，却是是嵌呆了的。但在那里並不覺得悶。在北面扶梯旁開着的窗口站一站，便立刻有高處不勝寒之感。</p>
<p>但該飯店因十四層地點適中，便把那里關成宴舞廳和雅座，而自稱之為「摩天廳」。那里的佈置確是雍容華貴。在南首，是一間正方形的敞廳，中間可以跳舞，四面則國着中間的空塲而擺列方形餐桌。北首一間也是正方，但佈置則又不和南首雷同。在這敞廳中間，又闢有一圓形舞塲（表演節目均在那上面舉行）。矗立處又比較髙，恰好十四層又正是該飯店由闊而狹的交界處，所以這摩天廳便有一個特殊的玻璃屋頂，用極美麗的圖案花紋鐵架托着半透明的一大塊玻璃，據說：當星月滿天的夜裏，還可以取開那玻璃，使這摩天廳一變而為露天花園，俾旅客得隨意觀摩蒼天呢。在該廳音樂台之後，兩扇小門在帷幕中隱着，向北走出去便是中西菜廚房。也要算是上海或全中國唯一的大規模燒飯間了吧？附屬於廚房的冷汽間中，可以冷藏三個月的全飯店旅客伙食，因此，新鮮菜不分季節，可以任意保留。又有一個「滌器機」間，洗起盛食物的碗盞來，可以又快又多又潔爭（並有專門洗滌銀器的機器）。並且，廚房內另有電梯專運菜蔬用品，可載一噸左右重的東西，上下極便利。</p>
<p>從十五層到二十層，據說都是常包住客，稱為公寓。內有舍客室，餐室，臥室，浴室，廚房，傭人室等，並有專門私用電梯。惟每月開消則非三千餘元不能問津，但目下五層均客滿，可見中國亦大有闊人也。從五層到十三層都是客房。其佈置大體也如上海其他著名旅館，但新頴別　則多獨出心裁之處。如開門進去　之甬道兩側　　　　　衣厨？邊為浴室，甬道上則有小擱權可置行李。每間呌侍者的電鈴均連帶設有圓形小燈一盞在門外。一掀電鈴，鈴響燈亮，鈴息人不來時燈總在亮着，以此可查出侍者之勤惰與侍應快慢。又有一種規矩，卽凡旅客之房間，均以單人為單位（每間由十數元一日至數十元一日不等），如預先聲明為雙人（尤其是女客非預先聲明眷屬關係，不得逗留至夜間十一時），則為備雙人臥具（床及被褥等），蓋防借此以作幽會之所，有傷風化故也。據傳該飯店為訓練侍應生，曾於開幕前數月特建房屋於大西路，並聘專家講授侍應學，嚴格訓練侍者，費去萬餘元不惜。現任實業部長吳鼎昌先生聞而嘉許，曾題贈主持侍應之盧君張君（兩君合編有侍應學一書，卽以之作訓練講義）。有詩云：『油鹽柴米醬醋茶，洒掃應對事如麻。爛熟一篇新論語，萬方賓至似還家！』第四層為總辦公處，我們去參觀時，正見許多侍者穿梭往來。問何故，知係受訓方畢，各歸執事。應對進退，極彬彬有禮。第三層，則為一極大休息室，西部南部都列有沙發，閱畫報架。該處專備旅客休息，會客，吸烟，閱報之用。大玻窗中望出去，一幅幅美麗的都市圖書映入視綫，精神為之一舒。東部設有美國式最新式之酒吧間，以備旅客飲食茶點，惟坐位則列於櫃台之前，充分使取食自由（此在歐美極為風行，影戲中也所常見）。下至二層，則為又一飯廳，佈置與摩　廳極不相同。南部為圓形，而北部為長方形。可供全飯店二百餘問旅客，數百人集合聚餐之用。筆者和友人在這裏留連了很久。不特炎暑全消，更覺如置身廣寒宮裏。俯視馬路中僕僕人物之汗流浹背，覺世間亦有桃源可避着，所惜者，如此淸福難久享耳。聞該飯店對一切工程如水電機　等特設專部自行管理，此則又儼然一個小規樣的理想國也。</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>們　觀的村人，都漸漸消　　濃霧昏黑之中了，只好拋棄　湖的念頭，在　湖濱尋求一個歸宿。</p>
<p>順着湖邊走，有時進一個灣巷，有時到了一個半島，有時翻山，有時越澗。在這夜色蒼茫中，寂寞沉靜的山空，黑漆無涯的太湖，除了風吹着樹枝，野禽在樹上飛動的響聲，以及西山對岸脚下的半明半暗，一閃一熄的漁火以外，宇宙，大地，都整個睡着了，只有我倆的足步聲和喘息聲合着拍子在那兒彈奏。茫茫大地，何處是我們的歸宿？我們不敢談話，恐怕有强人竊聽；也不敢休息，恐怕野獸出來呑噬；只沉毅地，勇敢地向前直奔，不管寄宿在那兒，不怕一夜都過不着一個盡頭。</p>
<p>大概走了二三十里，走到九點多鐘的時候，遠遠發見了一個人影。他是强盜嗎，怎麽這荒山上這夜間他還布獨行？不管他了，不要說是强盜，就是虎豹，我們也得前去，後退是無路的。幸好他是由太湖到蘇州來往的小販，他繼得蘇州話，同我們說：「照你們這樣走去，就是到明早也找不着宿處的。你們只好靠着左手轉灣，不久還可以回殿前去歇。」臨去時他又說：「山上滿淸靜，沒强盜。」依着他的吩咐，十時左右回到殿前。人也睡靜了，只得敲門求宿。</p>
<p>已經一大淸早了。我們才又循着舊路，照昨夜小販說的話去找湖濱楊灣的渡船。昨夜所經過的山谷，溪徑，令人恐怖的長松，峭石，不知蘊藏着些甚麽的森林，今天在陽光之下都成了絕妙的美景。山烏唱着歌，山花向着我們微笑，牧童也悠閒地在那裏嬉戲，湖濱點點漁船又一字兒出發湖中了。</p>
<p>楊灣的渡船要到下午三時才開行，我們又在湖濱洗脚，跟着淘　菜的村婦到她家裏去嘗有名的蒪菜，又寫了一封寄給朋友的信，託那到蘇州去的小商人交郵，信上寫着「某日於太湖東山下之楊灣。」</p>
<p>渡船開了，爬了一天一夜的東出漸漸與我們達離了。那不是莫釐峯嗎？那是昨夜惹超村人驚異的某鎭，那是船夫不渡我們的那個渡頭，那是灣着小販的那座山崗。呵！原來東山才是這樣，「不識廬山眞面目，只原身在此山中。」三十里寬的湖面不到一點半鐘就過去了。船上只有裁倆才是異方人，其他都是本湖內的小販小工。大家默默無聲，只望着那飄忽無定的春燕與沙鷗。</p>
<p>到了西洞庭山的鎭夏，更是言語不通，風俗各異的所在了。宰好遇着一個四年級的小學生，他粗略地認識幾個字，幷能說幾句蘇州話，他便是我們唯一的翻譯者了。他領我倆到苞山——在那松柏茂密的森林中的一座古刹。叩叩廟門，和尙們都遊山或趕鎭去了。我們便回到鎭夏去，在途旁的一座古墓傍邊，還靠着石板用石子畫了一個圍角棋盤，對了幾角棋才回去。</p>
<p>鎭夏是西山三十六鎭中最熱鬧的了，幾百漁船在斜陽西下時紛紛集在湖邊。山上探桑的老婦女和田間種稻的農人，以及往來於其他村鎭的小販，通回家安歇去了。處處發出炊烟，水上點綴着漁火，濛濛的夜降臨了。夜間住在一個老媼家中，她是這湖中唯一的旅社的主人。床舖是在那水濱架設的凉棚內。呼呼的湖風，淅淅的水聲，伴着那如豆的桐油燈，把衣，鞋，帽，通同作了枕，把僅有的幾張鈔票，幾角小洋，都塞進襪管去，一天的疲乏，夾着不住的蛙聲，把我們催入陲鄉了。做的是這樣的夢；有强盜把我們枕下的衣帽偷去了，並把襪子給我們脫去，撲通一聲把我倆拋進湖裏。待驚醒了轉來，如豆的燈火早已熄滅，鎭上已無人聲了，蛙也不呌了，只聽見呼呼的湖風，淅淅的水聲，宇宙是空虛靜寂。</p>
<p>第三天，遊過石公山，爬到縹緲峯。這是太湖中的最髙峯。三萬六千頃的在洋，七十二小島，西山脚下的三十六偭村鎭，東面的東山，靈嚴，鄧尉，天平，上方諸峯以及姑蘇城，北面的無錫，惠山，西面的宜與，南面的湖州，通統在望。太湖是偉大，是一個內海，是我生平所見的第一大水！據說湖中有漁船數千艘，依打漁為生者以萬計，其蘊藏之富實足驚人！</p>
<p>夜下六時到了舟鎭，無錫到湖州的輪船在這裏上客。在那黑夜，輪船乘風破浪地把我們拖進了湖州河。回過頭來，也看不見三四十里外的西洞庭山了，更看不見百多里外的東洞庭山了，只看見一片漆黑；不知道那是天空，那是湖面，只見着上下的星宿閃爍着。於是我們便離別盤旋三的太湖了。</p>

<p>故宮各門內外之石陛（如熙和，協和，太和…等門），欄杆上各柱頂球形之雕刻物，凡為花頭形者，其臨近門洞處必有數球之頂端穿小孔，不知此物者多疑為石質，年久風雨剝蝕而殘破，無關歷史古蹟也。蓋此物名「警號」，又曰「石哵啦」，又曰「石海哨」，乃為有警耗時，皇宮被包圍，禁兵以口吹石球，則聲嗚嗚如海螺，澈達於內廷，以便預備抗敵，或逃走，或殉焉。警號之名稱，凡旗籍曾充親軍或護軍者，以及一班久値內廷之侍衛太監等皆知之，故京各報之談掌故者，亦有人曾談及此，然此球狀物創於何時及如何吹法，則知者甚尠。</p>
<p>淸順治初至燕京時，命侍衛府（卽末葉之侍衛處）於內廷各門安「石哵啦</p>

<p>酒庫</p>
<p>福州酒肆，統稱作「酒庫」，是否沿宋官酒庫名也？厲樊榭束城雜記云：「宋朝酒醋皆官庫釀造，納緡錢於戶部，臨安有酒庫「醋庫」。按此本宋史，臨安酒庫，皆有官名。「吳自牧夢梁錄」所載如煮界庫，新界庫，南庫，北庫之類。又諸庫皆有官名，角妓設法賣酒。林昌彝射　樓詩話載，薩玉衡閩宮詞云：「酒庫新收醡袋殘」，朱竹垞題洪生對酒圖云：「酒庫京坊六度開」。東城雜記言：宋自王安石設法賣酒，併醋權之，南渡以後，軍興百費浩繁，遂不能革，則酒庫之有官庫，自此始也。「費滾梁溪漫志」云：東坡在齊安，有「春江綠漲葡萄醅」之句。靖康朝，韓子蒼舍人，作守，有旨，就賜郡釀，因名其庫為「葡萄醅」，亦可證也。按白香山有酒庫詩云：「此翁何處富，酒庫不曾空」，或自言藏酒處，非若宋之官庫也。而閩之酒庫究不知何指。</p>

<h3>National Elections and the Issue of Journalist Qualifications</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Among the issues of greatest concern to people from all walks of life in our country today, especially those in the news industry, besides the situations in the North and Guangxi, are probably the national elections.</p>
<p>The 1,200 representatives to the future National Assembly will have the important tasks of drafting a constitution, electing a head of state, and rescuing the country from its difficulties. How they are produced is indeed a matter of concern. Those of us engaged in the news industry are deeply interested in politics, firstly because of our profession itself, and secondly because we have more opportunities to participate in this National Assembly than other sectors, as long as we join a legitimate journalist organization. It is only natural that we are more concerned about the national elections.</p>
<p>Article 19 of the National Assembly Representative Election Law stipulates that "occupational groups and free professional groups participating in the election are limited to those established in accordance with the law before the promulgation of this law." Article 2 stipulates that "candidate representatives of provincial occupational groups are elected by the officials of the organs of each group." The appendix stipulates that "journalists' organizations elect 11 representatives." Currently, there are very few legally established journalists' organizations in provinces and cities across the country. The ratio of the number of people participating in these organizations to the number of representative seats cannot but be said to be very large among all occupational groups in the country.</p>
<p>However, such regulations have raised the issue of journalist qualifications. This is because, firstly, the qualifications of journalists in our country do not have legal standards like those of accountants and lawyers; secondly, the organizational structure of journalist groups in our country is still very immature. For those groups that have already been established, membership is limited to reporters from daily newspapers and news agencies. As everyone knows, there are many and indiscriminate news agencies in our country. Just by borrowing a mimeograph to publish a few pages of questionable news, one can appear to be a news agency. Therefore, organizations often have no way to refuse the inclusion of any fake journalists. At the same time, genuinely excellent journalists who have the ability to analyze and critique current affairs issues and who often write for various periodicals are unable to participate in organizations due to restrictions in the articles of association. Thirdly, most provinces and cities do not yet have journalists' organizations. The regulations on the news industry in the election law are very convenient in terms of procedure, but they cannot but be said to be too narrow due to the above three reasons.</p>
<p>Recently, colleagues in the Nanjing news industry, because the local journalists' organization has not yet been established, have petitioned the central government and the election office to find a way to remedy the regulations on the news industry in the election law. This request is of course very reasonable. However, to make the participation of the national news industry in this national election feel fairly equitable, the central government should have reasonable regulations on the qualification standards of journalists. At the same time, the news industry should also make the organizational structure of groups as widespread and sound as possible. However, this cannot be allowed during the short election period. Therefore, the expedient remedy is only to change the phrase "before the promulgation of this law" in Article 19 of the election law.</p>
<p>We journalists are the providers of spiritual food for the people and have the responsibility to contribute opinions to national affairs as much as the national representatives. We can get rid of the vanity of national representatives more than the general public. Therefore, as long as there is a reasonable change in the regulations on the right to vote and to be elected of journalists in the election law, our news industry should not be too concerned.</p>
<h3>Misunderstanding Between Chinese and Japanese Troops in Fengtai Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Two Koreans were spying near our garrison in Fengtai late on the 21st for a long time. Our troops suspected that their actions were suspicious, so they ordered them to leave. They refused, resulting in a misunderstanding. Our troops captured one of them, and the other fled to the Japanese garrison barracks to report. Soon, several Japanese soldiers went to negotiate, and as a result, captured one of our soldiers. Now, after investigation by the Chinese and Japanese authorities, it is believed that the matter was a misunderstanding, and the captured personnel on both sides were returned to each other, and a storm subsided. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese military authorities investigated the truth of the incident in which a Korean was stabbed in Fengtai. The result was that the sender was Morikawa Dairo (26 years old), an employee of the Japanese trading company Koito Ito, who is Japanese, not Korean. (22nd Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) It is reported that a certain Korean was stabbed in Fengtai last night. Today at noon, a team of Japanese military police, accompanied by Chinese officers, went to investigate. According to sources from the Japanese side, the Korean's shoulder and left chest were stabbed with a bayonet, and the injuries were quite serious. He was immediately sent to the Fengtai Japanese military hospital for surgery, and it is heard that there is hope for recovery. Chen Zhongfu, Director of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hebei and Chahar Political Council, has gone to Tianjin to discuss the case with the Japanese Consul General.

<h3>Soviet Russia Begins Strengthening Western Defenses, European Affairs Increase Defense in British Territories, British Navy Responds to Mediterranean Situation</h3>
<p>Riga According to sources here, after Soviet Russia ordered the conscription age to be reduced to 19, it has begun to build new barracks along the western border to accommodate the million-strong army that will be conscripted this autumn. According to official statistics, the number of aircraft manufactured by Soviet Russia this year has exceeded the total number of the previous year by about 72 percent. Soviet Russia will soon be on par with the combined strength of the air forces of other countries in the world. Now, with the increase in the strength of the army, the national power of Soviet Russia will be absolutely incomparable. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Due to the overall situation in Europe, the British self-governing territories defense plan has caused repercussions. Once something happens in the Mediterranean, the British Navy will focus on dealing with it and will not be able to attend to other things. Therefore, Australia and New Zealand should accelerate their military preparations plans.</p>
<p>The Australian Defense Conference has decided not to wait for its three-year defense plan to be completed in 1937, but to begin implementing a more advanced plan in September of this year. This move will increase the current procedures. It is estimated that the funds required for this fiscal year will reach about 8 million pounds. The Australian Defense Conference is willing to cooperate with the British government to complete its military preparations, and now recommends (1) increasing the recruitment of naval reserves, (2) establishing oil storage stations in the ports of Darwin and Sydney, (3) consolidating coastal defenses, placing nine-inch two and eight-inch caliber cannons and sea searchlights, anti-aircraft guns, etc., (4) making military equipment more mechanized, (5) preparing more aircraft and assisting aircraft manufacturing, (6) increasing the strength of bomber and reconnaissance aircraft squadrons, establishing civil aircraft teams, and creating tank and machine gun manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Parliament debated the defense plan for a whole day and has now ended. Both parties believe that defense is now an urgent matter and should cooperate with the Australian and British governments to carry out a joint plan. Minister of National Defense Jones announced that the national defense plan discussed by the New Zealand government contains measures to consolidate coastal defenses according to a long-term plan, increase military expenditure, maintain flagship-style cruisers, and improve air stations. He also said that the defense expenditure now spent by New Zealand is sixteen shillings and nine pence per person, Australia is twenty shillings, and the Union of South Africa is fourteen shillings.

<h3>Germany Protests to Russia, Newspapers Also Heavily Criticize Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Ambassador to Russia, Nadolny, recently protested to the Soviet government because the Moscow Radio Station broadcasts programs every day that "oppose Germany and are of an inflammatory nature" and requested that it be stopped. At the same time, the German Chargé d'affaires in Spain also protested to the Madrid government because the Spanish "Communist Party's short-wave radio station often slander German overseas Chinese in the country." (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers have recently suddenly launched a major criticism of the Soviet Union, pointing out that the country is sparing no effort in building up its army and preparing its equipment, all of which is aggressive. Today, newspapers all carried reports that the Soviet Union is actively preparing to take aggressive action towards its western border. Some newspapers said that the Soviet Union is now building barracks along the Finnish border, from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Kronstadt naval port in Leningrad City, in preparation for emergencies. Other newspapers said that Moscow is about to instigate a world revolution, and all civilized countries in the world should unite and imitate the Crusaders of the Middle Ages to stop it. Foreigners here are not without surprise at such propaganda, because Germany has only criticized the Communist Party's propaganda movement, and only recently has it turned its criticism to the military. Diplomatic circles said that since Germany abolished the Locarno Treaty on March 7 of this year, it has been actively building forts and other military projects in the Rhineland region every day, and the German Navy is now actively preparing in the Baltic Sea, sparing no effort. The Germanic shipyard belonging to the Krupp Artillery Factory has also stepped up its work recently. All these things are enough to make the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula panic and uneasy. How can building barracks in the border area be used to accuse other countries? This has also been expressed by observers in other countries recently. German diplomacy has always focused on alienating France and its allied countries. The sudden criticism of Soviet Russia by various newspapers is in line with this policy. Germany is now taking advantage of the Spanish incident to make dangerous remarks. Its intention is to stir up the hearing of some public opinion in Britain and France, so that they will be suspicious of the Soviet Union's revolutionary tendencies. Other people said that the anti-Russian movement in various newspapers was launched by the National Socialist Party and has nothing to do with the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The main purpose is to create a favorable environment before the National Socialist Party Congress, which will be held in Nuremberg next month. (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The government recently instructed Nadolny, the ambassador to Russia, to make representations to the Soviet government because the Moscow Radio Station broadcasts anti-German programs every day. Various newspapers have recently commented on this matter with large headlines. Among them, the National Socialist Party's newspaper "People's Observer" stated, "After Germany made this representation, it should make the Soviet Union realize that if their Jewish Bolsheviks continue to provoke and arbitrarily slander Premier Hitler and the German government, then Germany will never remain silent. In short, if the governments of Spain and Soviet Russia cannot treat themselves as civilized countries, then we must give these Jewish Bolsheviks a new lesson." The Berlin Daily News said, "It is hoped that the government's recent representation will serve as a warning so that European countries can understand the meaning of the radio waves broadcast by Soviet Russia. What's more, if this warning is ineffective, then we must use this representation as a basis and take all necessary measures." (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Anti-Government Case: Trotsky's Route to Seize Power: Defeat in War Against Japan or Death of Stalin</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today, as the court continued to hear the cases of the counter-revolutionary criminals, the historically famous communist revolutionary leaders, Zinoviev and Kamenev, upon hearing Prosecutor Vyshinsky demand that the criminals be sentenced to death, immediately sat in their chairs in the courtroom, weeping with the other fourteen defendants. The expressions of all the defendants showed they could not bear it any longer. Prosecutor Vyshinsky declared, "This secret combination of political assassins is no different from beasts. They must pay for the serious crimes they have committed against the motherland with their heads," and so on. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The court opened this morning, and defendant Goltzman was tried. He was an extremely secret member of the Moscow Trotskyist Center, who made contact with Trotsky. Goltzman said that in 1932, he was ordered by Smirnov to take advantage of his opportunity to go abroad, secretly deliver Smirnov's report on the domestic situation in the Soviet Union, as well as communication codes, to Trotsky via Sedov. Goltzman then went from Berlin to Copenhagen to meet Trotsky, with the aim of obtaining Trotsky's orders for secret Trotskyist work in the Soviet Union. During the meeting, Trotsky ordered him to personally inform Smirnov of the need to adopt terrorist means, first assassinating Stalin. Trotsky said that only through this path could the Trotskyists seize power, and advocated selecting a cadre of terrorists. Goltzman said that he did not convey Trotsky's order to Smirnov because he did not approve of the terrorist policy. Goltzman admitted that he had brought back illegal documents of the Trotskyists from abroad.</p>
<p>Next, Natan Lurie was tried, who was sent by Trotsky from abroad to carry out terrorist activities. Lurie confessed that in 1932, he was ordered by Trotsky in New York to come to Moscow from Germany to participate in the terrorist group organized by Franz Weitz. Weitz was then residing in Moscow as a German engineer and was an active member of the German National Socialist Party, deeply trusted by leader Himmler, who is now the leader of the "Gestapo." According to Weitz, the main task of the group was to prepare for the assassination of Stalin, Voroshilov, and Kaganovich. After Weitz left the Soviet Union for Germany in 1932, Lurie became the leader of the group. Lurie confessed that he and the Trotskyists had been preparing to assassinate Voroshilov for half a year. They followed Voroshilov's car, but because the car was moving too fast, they could not shoot. After that, they decided to use bombs to carry out terrorist activities. From 1933 to 1935, Lurie worked as a doctor in "Chelyabinsk," attempting to kill Kaganovich and Ordzhonikidze when they came there. They came many times, but they were never able to get close to them.</p>
<p>In 1936, on the way to Leningrad, Lurie met Mosse Lurie, another terrorist sent by Trotsky to the Soviet Union, who ordered him to assassinate Zhdanov during the May Day parade in Leningrad. This attempt also failed. Natan Lurie was arrested on May 20, and his terrorist activities were thus terminated.</p>
<p>Defendant Mosse Lurie confessed that in March 1933, he was ordered by Rose Fischer and Maslov to bring Trotsky's orders regarding organizing terrorist activities and preparing for armed rebellion in the Soviet Union from Berlin to Moscow. He conveyed this order to Zinoviev through a person trusted by Zinoviev. Afterwards, he was invited by Zinoviev to his apartment. At this time, Zinoviev advised Lurie to agree to contact the "Gestapo," using the latter to fight against the Communist Party leaders, and agreed to use individual assassinations as a method of this struggle. Mosse Lurie admitted that he had directed Natan Lurie's terrorist group, reported the work of the group to Zinoviev, ordered Lurie to assassinate Ordzhonikidze in "Chelyabinsk," and as early as January 1936, ordered him to organize terrorist activities in Leningrad against Zhdanov.</p>
<p>Defendant Ter-Vaganyan, one of the leaders of the Trotskyist organization, also proved Smirnov's leading role in this organization. Vaganyan said, "Smirnov is unwilling to reveal the full truth here, lest he confess in court other personnel whom he does not wish to confess." He continued that Smirnov and Trotsky were acquainted and had contacted Georgian traitors as early as 1928. These betrayals were discussed by Smirnov with the Lominadze group in 1932, introduced by Vaganyan. Vaganyan described his position in the organization, admitted to participating in terrorist plans, and said that he ordered Fleerant to organize a terrorist group in 1934.</p>
<p>After the court trial was completed, the evening session interrogated Trotskyist Fritz David, who was ordered by Trotsky to come to the Soviet Union from Berlin to personally assassinate Stalin. David confessed that after meeting with Trotsky's son Sedov in Berlin, he went to Copenhagen to meet Trotsky. Trotsky ordered him to go to Moscow, not to contact the Soviet Trotskyists, and to carry out terrorist activities against Stalin alone. Trotsky emphatically said that David, to follow his conspiracy, must verbally and actively support the Communist Party's policies in newspapers in the Soviet Union. In his conversation with David, Trotsky pointed out two routes for the Trotskyists to seize power: either defeat in a war with Japan or the death of Stalin. Trotsky pointed out that the latter was closer because Stalin was striving for peace in the East. In 1933, David arrived in the Soviet Union and, with terrorist Baumann Yurin, prepared to assassinate Stalin at the 13th plenary session of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, but because Stalin did not attend this plenary session, they postponed their terrorist activities to await the 7th Congress of the Communist International. David tried to obtain work in the Communist International and attended the Congress, but because he could not get close to Stalin, he failed to carry out terrorist activities. David told the court that the failure of this action was due to the extraordinary and enthusiastic cheers for Stalin at the Congress, which seemed to paralyze his actions. David confessed that after this Congress, Sedov had twice sent special envoys from Berlin to demand the rapid assassination of Stalin. David admitted that he maintained his terrorist tendencies until his arrest. (TASS, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) During today's interrogation of Zinoviev, Kamenev, and the other fourteen counter-revolutionaries, another shocking event occurred. As a result of the confessions of the criminals, the prosecutor announced in court that he would investigate the crimes of Radek, Bukharin, Rykov, Tomsky, and Pyatakov for participating in the Trotskyist alliance. What is strange is that the newspaper Pravda just published two strongly worded essays by Radek. Radek, who was originally a spokesman for Stalin's foreign affairs, had stated in the article that he should sentence a group of brutal assassins to death, and said that the actions of these thugs should have been severely punished long ago. Radek's article also stated, "Those in the nation who want to harm our beloved leader must pay for their unforgivable crimes with their lives. The mastermind of this conspiracy is Trotsky, who will inevitably not escape the punishment of the world proletariat." However, this time, Kamenev implicated Radek in his confession, saying that he had also participated in the conspiracy to overthrow the current government, which is quite contradictory.

<h3>Korean Governor-General Nan Jiro Takes Office</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Korean Governor-General Nan Jiro departed from Tokyo Station at 9:00 a.m. on the 22nd to take office in Korea. Many officials and civilians went to the station to see him off. After visiting the Ise Grand Shrine and Momoyama Mausoleum on the way, he is scheduled to receive the affairs from former Governor-General Ugaki in Kyoto on the 24th. He will enter Seoul on the afternoon of the 26th. Before taking office, Governor-General Nan issued a statement in the form of a talk, the main points of which are as follows: Since he has been entrusted with the great task of being the Governor-General of Korea, he will certainly abide by the edict on the rule of Korea, seek the development of the people's strength and the development of industry and trade, and further promote the integration of Korea and Japan to live up to the principle of treating everyone equally. He believes that the foundation of peace in the East lies in consolidating the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchuria, and that Korea and Manchuria are adjacent to each other, so the two nations must unite to seek coexistence and co-prosperity. We should serve the public with an indomitable spirit and utmost sincerity. (Domei, 22nd)</p>
<h3>At the Pacific Institute Meeting: Soviet Russian Representative's Declaration: Acknowledges Our Sovereignty in Outer Mongolia; U.S. Representative Accuses Soviet Russia of Reddening Outer Mongolia; Japanese Representative Claims Japan Does Not Want to Be Isolated</h3>
<p>Estes Park The Pacific Institute continued its meeting today. The Soviet Russian representative declared that the Soviet Union had no territorial ambitions in Outer Mongolia. The Soviet Union's only act of aggression was to expel the informal troops that the Mongolians could not handle. He also said that the treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia had already guaranteed the security of Outer Mongolia. The treaty is the Mutual Assistance Treaty signed on March 12, stipulating the obligation of mutual assistance when a third party attacks. However, he also stated that once the military operations are over, the mutual assistance troops must withdraw to their original defenses in their home country. The Soviet Union still recognizes China's sovereignty over Outer Mongolia. The U.S. representative then stood up to refute the Soviet Russian representative's remarks, saying that the Soviet Union is now gradually trying to redden Outer Mongolia through industrial aggression and the construction of railways. The Chinese delegation then reiterated that all the treaties signed after 1911 recognized China's sovereignty over Outer Mongolia. Other representatives believed that Japan is currently trying to improve Mongolian wool so that it can supply Japanese industry. (National, 21st)</p>
<p>Estes Park The Japanese representative gave a speech to the Pacific Institute today, saying that Japan does not want to be isolated. In a few years, Japan will be able to restore its previous international status. We are currently adjusting our internal affairs. British representative Sir Wigram claimed that all countries fear Japan's trade expansion as if it were a demon, but the increase in Japan's export trade is not as great as the newspapers and government authorities of various countries have publicized. Former U.S. Secretary of War Baker agreed with this, saying that the amount of Japan's international trade expansion is not as far as other countries imagine. (National, 21st)</p>
<p>Estes Park The Pacific Institute continued its meeting here today. The Soviet representative, Lomov, gave a speech, vehemently attacking Japan's business policies, saying that Japan deliberately suppressed prices to develop its export trade, so that other countries could not compete with it. It is important to know that most modern wars are caused by the unrestricted competition of various countries' export industries. In view of this, the Soviet Union's development of foreign trade will never endanger world peace. He also said that the Soviet army is an element for maintaining world peace. The conclusion was that once the Soviet Union's power in the Far East expands, the commercial route across the Arctic Ocean will be opened up accordingly. If so, the route from the Soviet ports to the U.S. ports along the Pacific coast will inevitably be greatly shortened. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Belgium Captures German Spy</h3>

<h3>Gandhi's Rural Life</h3>
<p>Bombay Mahatma Gandhi is now living a rural life in a thatched cottage in Higaon Village, seven miles from Wardha. His wife and secretary live in Wardha and visit him every day. However, every time it rains, water accumulates along the way, making transportation very inconvenient. There are more than a hundred tiled and thatched houses in the village. Gandhi lives in a tiled house, one of which is his reading room. In addition, there is a kitchen, a storage room, and a bathroom. Next to the house is a small sheep pen. The villagers always follow him in prayer every morning and evening. Gandhi has no specific plans for the future. (National, 20th)</p>
<h3>Australia Experiments with Rubber Road</h3>
<p>Sydney, Australia Queensland is currently experimenting with building rubber roads. The rubber used is transported from New Guinea. The cost of building rubber roads is too high, but if the experiment is successful, this rubber road will be extended to other parts of Australia, so that cars will no longer need rubber tires in the future.

<h3>Japanese Business Circles and Political Parties Oppose Nationalization of Electricity; Ministry of Communications Changes to Propose Electricity Control Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The application of the current Electricity Business Law is being strengthened, or the form of private ownership and private operation is retained, or the control of special companies is strengthened, etc., have been considered with considerable force, but it is questionable whether the Minister of Communications agrees to this alternative plan. Moreover, it is needless to say that the Seiyukai opposes the Minister of Communications' plan, but there are also those within the Minseito who adopt opposition arguments, which is extremely unfavorable to the Minister of Communications' position. In the event that the Minseito formally opposes it, the government will certainly not adopt the Minister of Communications' plan. The fate of the Minister of Communications' plan depends on the attitude of the Minseito. However, the Army initially strongly supported the Minister of Communications' plan, and the realization of the nationalization of electricity was determined to be a touchstone for the establishment of a widespread controlled economy that the military intended. If it cannot be established due to opposition from business circles and political parties, Minister of the Army Terauchi will resolutely oppose it and always support the realization of the nationalization plan. At this time, Prime Minister Hirota must be in a dilemma. (Domei, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the talks between Prime Minister Hirota and Minister of Communications Raigetsu yesterday, it was decided to change the name of the Ministry of Communications' electricity nationalization plan to the electricity control plan and submit it to the Cabinet meeting on the 28th as a national policy. According to the Minister of Communications, although the name of the electricity nationalization plan has been changed, its content has not changed. The Prime Minister made this change of name to ease the opinions of opponents and avoid misunderstandings. At present, there is no other way to control electricity except for this nationalization plan, so no matter what requirements there are, its fundamental policy must not be changed. (Domei, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Cabinet meeting on the 21st, the second meeting of the four ministers decided on the scope of national policy. The preliminary negotiations on the national policy issue came to an end with this. In the future, the four ministers' meeting will focus on defense expenditures and discuss the formulation policy for the next year's budget. It is heard that the defense expenditures requested by the military are 800 million yuan for the Army and 770 million yuan for the Navy, exceeding this year's defense expenditures of 550 million yuan. However, Finance Minister Baba plans to allocate 100 million or 130 million yuan from the new financial resources of 500 million yuan as national policy expenditures for new civil administration, so it is necessary to cut the military expenditures of 1.57 billion yuan requested by the military by at least 200 million yuan or more. The two ministers of the military have no objections to Finance Minister Baba's policy, but the strengthening of national defense is the first national policy, and the necessary expenditures should not be paid from general financial resources, but should be issued public bonds to seek funding. The Finance Minister and the two ministers of the military have different opinions on financial resources, so difficult situations will inevitably occur in future four ministers' meetings.

(Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Jerusalem People in general are paying close attention to the arrival of Iraqi Foreign Minister Nuri in this area, because when Nuri was in Palestine, he had meetings with many Arab leaders.

<p>Trade Conditions in Various Countries Around the World</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to the League of Nations Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, the total value of world trade in June of this year (calculated in gold coins) decreased by 50% compared with May of the same year. This is a seasonal change and is not unusual. As for comparing the total value of trade in the four, five, and six months of this year with the same period last year, it increased by 8%. However, because the price of gold this year has increased by 6% compared to last year, the actual net increase in the total value of trade in the four, five, and six months of this year is only 2% compared to the same period last year. The rise and fall of the price index of various countries in June are briefly described as follows:</p>

<h3>Five Weeks of the Spanish Civil War: Government Forces Take Offensive on All Fronts; Northern Route Digs Trenches to Defend; War Difficult to Resolve in Two Months</h3>
<p>Madrid The revolutionary military has begun its sixth week. Today, government forces have launched strong offensives in eight of the eleven battle zones across the country. Only in the vicinity of and San Sebastian are defensive measures taken. However, both military authorities still believe that the war cannot be resolved within two months. (National, 22nd)</p>
<p>Madrid The Spanish Civil War has reached its fifth week, and the outcome is still difficult to predict. The positions of the major forces on both sides in the four main war zones are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Northern Route: Both sides are digging trenches along long lines of defense around Irún and San Sebastian. Long-range shelling of San Sebastian is currently underway. Oviedo has not yet fallen. More Moroccan troops continue to arrive at the rebel headquarters in Burgos from the south.</p>
<p>Southern Route: The rebels claim that Seville and Granada have been linked. The government claims that the troops loyal to the government are currently advancing towards Granada, and a major decisive battle will take place there within days.</p>
<p>Western Route: The rebels claim to have occupied Alcantara near Badajoz. The government claims that the government troops advancing to the front line to rescue the officers and soldiers in Badajoz have captured Zutlope.</p>
<p>Vicinity of Madrid: The government declares that government troops have won the battle of Guadarrama. The rebels also claim that 20,000 reinforcements will arrive in Sierra de Gaine and prepare to attack the capital.</p>
<p>The situation in the remaining parts of the battle has not changed. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Madrid The Associated Press correspondent accompanying the government army in Guadarrama reported that government forces bombed rebel fortifications with air power today, and large units of infantry followed up with an advance of five and a half miles. (National, 21st)</p>
<p>Hendaye A special dispatch from our reporter: The front-line situation in Irún in northern Spain is quiet. This morning, government troops completed their defenses in strategic locations in the area to block the rebel advance. This afternoon, the rebel cruiser "España" heavily shelled the Guadarlupe battery. It is also reported that it shelled the port of San Sebastian, but this is difficult to confirm. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Hendaye According to news from the border between France and Spain, government troops on the front lines of Guipúzcoa Province in northern Spain are currently building defenses and installing barbed wire to strengthen their defenses. The main road from Irún to San Sebastian is still unobstructed. The battle line is currently only 15 kilometers from San Sebastian, but the situation in the city is calm as usual. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Burgos The headquarters of the Northern Route General Command of the Revolutionary Army, which was originally located in this city, was moved to Valladolid on the 20th of this month for the convenience of supervising the battle (southwest of Burgos, closer to Madrid). (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Madrid The rebels continued to send troops from the south to the northern front lines. Yesterday, a Moroccan rifle brigade arrived in Burgos, where the rebel government is located, from Seville and then set off again, but its destination is unknown. General Estrella, the founder of the Spanish Foreign Legion, inspected 2,000 garrison troops in Burgos before heading to the front lines. It is estimated that there are currently 200,000 such trained troops in northern Spain. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Spanish Civil War: Five Bishops Killed; Appeal from Priests in Madrid</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to Vatican sources, five bishops have already been killed in the Spanish Civil War. They are the bishops of Jaén, Lérida, Segovia, Sigüenza, and Barbastro. Currently, the Cardinal Archbishop in the area of ​​Cádiz and the Archbishop and priests in Madrid are quite safe. However, there is no information about the Bishop of Barcelona. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Madrid: A Catholic priest named García, recently delivered a broadcast speech to Catholics across the country, roughly stating that the working class respects priests who proclaim the true meaning of Christ. It is regrettable that some authorities of the Church, instead of proclaiming the meaning of universal love, have used sacred churches as fortresses to attack the working class. Therefore, they should be held responsible for this incident. Modern civilization, though often carried out in the name of Christ, is not, in reality, a Christian civilization. If it does not know how to lead social disputes, but only stirs up human hatred, then this civilization will inevitably collapse under the oppression of socialism and communism. García then fiercely criticized the rebels, saying that all Catholics must support the legitimate government and not side with the rebels. "What you call desecration of the sacred will surely lead to victory, for these people understand the will of the people, and the will of the people is the will of God." (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Neutrality Towards Spain: Italy Accepts French Proposal; Volunteers Not Allowed</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italy's sudden acceptance of the neutrality agreement initiated by France regarding Spain is, in terms of diplomatic action, quite unexpected. It is reported that Italy had raised several questions to France regarding this matter, but Foreign Minister Ciano, without waiting for France's reply, invited the French ambassador to Rome tonight and presented him with a note stating complete acceptance of France's proposal. He also agreed that the agreement could take effect as soon as the governments of France, Britain, Portugal, the Soviet Union, and Russia accepted it. Ciano also issued a warning, saying that public donations to help both sides of the conflict, and the volunteering of foreign citizens to join the Spanish army, seem likely to harm international relations. (Reuter's dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding France's proposal to conclude an agreement of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, Foreign Minister Count Ciano delivered a reply to the French Ambassador Chambrun this afternoon. While expressing acceptance of the French proposal, it maintained the original position regarding two reservations: (1) prohibiting financial assistance to the two warring factions in Spain; (2) prohibiting people of all countries from voluntarily joining the two warring factions in Spain. The main points of the reply are divided into four items: (1) Italy agrees to prohibit the export of military weapons, ammunition, and various military supplies to Spain and Spanish territories; (2) The current contracts for ordering the above-mentioned war equipment shall also be subject to this prohibition; (3) Italy agrees to maintain constant contact with other governments that adopt the same measures; (4) Once the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Portugal participate in the above-mentioned measures, the Italian government will implement the above declaration. The reply also stated that Italy supports the suggestion of direct non-interference, but believes that all indirect interference, such as private donations and volunteering, should also be prohibited in countries participating in this agreement. The conclusion stated that all European countries manufacturing military equipment should provide the same promises. After the issuance of the above reply, political figures here expressed satisfaction, believing that this is a practical factor that can make France's draft agreement a reality. Not only that, but the restoration of normal international relations, and the preparatory work for the Five-Power Locarno Pact conference, can also be facilitated. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The French Chargé d'Affaires, Cambon, recently sent a copy of the Italian government's reply to the French draft non-interference agreement to the Foreign Office. At the same time, he stated that the French government expressed satisfaction with this reply and had taken various measures to prohibit its citizens from volunteering for the two warring factions in Spain. As for prohibiting loans to the two warring factions in Spain, the French government, although not entirely certain, will find ways to resolve it, so as to satisfy Italy. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Britain Did Not Contact Germany and Italy Regarding the German Ship Search Incident; Spain Declares No Search of British Ships</h3>
<p>(London) According to today's news, the British government has not directly consulted with Germany or Italy regarding the so-called blockade order recently issued by the Spanish government, and does not believe that this order was caused by the interference of Spanish warships with the German ship "Camerun." Regarding the interference with the "Camerun" case, the British government has consistently stated that the major powers should quickly reach a resolution so that the essential points of the non-interference agreement in the Spanish Civil War can be effectively implemented. If the matter is delayed for a long time, the occurrence of minor accidents will make compromise more difficult. With this idea, the British government, without waiting for unanimous agreement from all countries, took unilateral action, canceling all passports for arms and aircraft exports to Spain, and actively promoted various countries to accept France's proposal. At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, the British government repeatedly warned both opposing sides through its naval commander stationed in Gibraltar and Spanish territorial waters that they must not interfere with British ships. If interference occurred, Britain would resist, and issued another warning that if aircraft flew over the skies of Gibraltar, they would first fire three warning shots. If they still did not change direction, they would be bombed. This warning is a normal procedure to protect national interests and has not caused any disputes or hindered the principle of non-interference. Therefore, Britain deeply understands Germany's dissatisfaction with the Spanish warship's interference with the "Camerun". What is comforting is that the German government has not yet formally stated that France's non-interference proposal should be delayed until the case is satisfactorily resolved. The Spanish government's blockade order is still a matter of negotiation between London and Madrid. According to authoritative legal experts, the Spanish navy's attempt to exercise belligerent rights on the high seas must be preceded by the establishment of preconditions before such rights can become legal. One of the preconditions is the existence of a recognized state of belligerency, but so far no country has recognized the Spanish rebels as belligerents, and it is widely believed that the Spanish government does not want to recognize the rebels as having this qualification. Secondly, international law stipulates that a blockade must be serious in order to be effective. Given the lengthy nature of these preconditions, a country cannot exercise such belligerent rights as inspection on the high seas. (Reuter's dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London: According to responsible sources, the Spanish government recently notified the British government that Spanish warships would not inspect British ships sailing outside Spanish territorial waters. Officials feel that because existing international law has never clearly defined the boundaries of territorial waters, although the Spanish government has issued this notice, the issue of the scope of British ship navigation has not been resolved, hence the difficulty. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The United States Strictly Adheres to Neutrality; the State Department Clearly Announces to Arms Dealers</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department recently issued a warning to arms factories across the country, prohibiting them from violating the neutrality policy adopted by the country and selling military supplies, especially aircraft and aircraft engines, to Spain. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department, in response to arms manufacturers' inquiries about the government's attitude towards the Spanish Civil War, stated that selling all military materials to Spain is inconsistent with the United States' declared policy of strict neutrality. (Reuter's dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Socialist Parties of Various Countries Adopt Unified Action to Assist Spanish Workers</h3>
<p>(London) The American Socialist Federation recently held a meeting here, and passed a resolution advocating the immediate convocation of Congress to discuss the situation in Spain, and demanded that trade unions across the country find ways to prevent domestic industry and commerce from providing assistance to Spanish rebels. Conversely, they should provide food to the workers in that country to show their cooperation. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The chairman of the Second International Executive Committee, de Brouckère, the secretary-general, Attlee, the chairman of the International Federation of Trade Unions, Citrine, and the secretary-general, Schevenels, recently held a meeting here. The secretary-general of the French General Confederation of Labor, Stonehouse, and other leaders of trade union organizations from Britain and Belgium also attended. After the meeting, a communiqué was issued stating that today's meeting had decided to take several measures that are in line with the interests of the international labor movement and the Spanish workers, who are now fighting for the republican system and the spirit of democracy.

<h3>British Newspapers Call for Peace: How Can the Civil War Bear So Much Slaughter? Britain and France Should Jointly Advise</h3>
<p>(London) The Liberal Party's Manchester Guardian recently published an article on the Spanish Civil War, urging Britain and France to jointly advise the Spanish government forces and rebels to consider humanitarianism when fighting, in order to turn hostility into friendship. It said, "Civilized nations that wish to live and work in peace and harmony should work together to advise the Spanish belligerent groups not to kill too much. Prisoners of both armies must be exchanged with each other and should not be shot. If this appeal receives an enthusiastic response, then we should further appeal to the Spanish armies to negotiate a ceasefire, and hope that Germany and Italy will also rise up in response and participate in this war cessation movement." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The liberal magazine "The Economist" recently published an article arguing that Britain must assist the Spanish democratic government with utmost urgency, roughly stating that countries' declaration of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War may not be effective. As for Britain, at a time when fascist countries are continuously supplying the Spanish rebels, it is unwise to prohibit the transportation of British arms to Spain. Sooner or later, our country must state its position and clearly declare that, for the sake of Britain's own interests, it has no choice but to provide assistance to the Spanish government. The reasons for this are twofold: (1) Protecting countries with a residential system is a necessary act in principle; (2) Curbing the ambitions of Italy and Germany in the Mediterranean is a matter of military strategy that cannot be delayed. "Those who criticize Britain for only protecting its own interests should be answered, 'How is it that protecting one's own interests, if it does not violate one's duties and conscience, is not to be blamed for hypocrisy?' Our government must now quickly declare that it is prepared to join other countries in upholding the rights enjoyed by the legitimate democratic government internationally. Otherwise, the victory of the four-nation rebels will be the prelude to the victory of the dictatorial system on the entire European continent, and the victory of the dictatorial system will inevitably become uncontrollable.

The floodwaters on the Pearl River were as high as the banks, and all the docks were submerged. The low-lying streets in the Xidi to Huangsha area in Xiguan were flooded. In some sections of Huangsha, the water was as deep as three feet. Pedestrians raised their clothes and walked barefoot through the water, in a very embarrassing situation. As for rooftop structures, such as canopies, cloth tents, and street signs, were all blown down by the wind. There were more than ten fires caused by broken power lines throughout the city, burning two men and women to death. In addition, several houses collapsed, injuring several people. The fire brigade was fully mobilized and rushed to the scene of the accident to rescue. After the power lines were destroyed in the city, the electricity was cut off in various places. After nightfall, some shops and households were plunged into darkness. During the day, the northeast wind made the market desolate. The losses from this typhoon in Guangzhou alone are estimated to be no less than one million yuan. (Evening of August 18)</p>

<h3>Nanjing City's Progress in Conducting Anti-Malaria Work</h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: Malaria mosquitoes transmit diseases. Patients may die in severe cases or be harmed in mild cases, harming the people and affecting society. This is a matter of great concern. Most countries around the world have successively carried out anti-malaria work. In our country, except for Hong Kong, which is under foreign administration, Nanjing is the first in the country to do so. Malaria is prevalent in the southern part of our country. Taking Nanjing as an example, according to the construction of Sun Yat-Sen's Mausoleum between 19 and 24, 355 out of 498 workers suffered from malaria. In addition, the Central Hospital reported that it treated 798 malaria patients in 21 and 22, of which 312 had malaria in summer and autumn. Among these 312 people, 33 died despite medical treatment, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total. From this, we can infer the rampant state of its epidemic. In view of this, the Nanjing Municipal Government convened relevant agencies in February of last year to form an Anti-Malaria Committee to promote anti-malaria work. However, Nanjing has a vast area, many ponds, and the people have low intelligence and cannot provide direct and indirect assistance. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve perfection overnight. Therefore, the promotion of anti-malaria work can only be done by treating both the symptoms and the root causes and gradually achieving success. The implementation and future plans of anti-malaria work in Nanjing are briefly described below.</p>
<p>1. Implementation: The Health Office established three health inspectors and fourteen coolies, divided into three groups, each group of four people, and two people as a special group. The three health inspectors were first given strict training in anti-malaria and field practice by the Health Laboratory. In addition to supervising the anti-malaria coolie work, their responsibilities include measuring, mapping, collecting mosquito larvae, and assessing the achievements in various places. The anti-malaria coolies were given one week of practice training in implementing anti-malaria work. The working area is centered on Daxing Palace, with a circle of 3.175 li as a radius. There are a total of 523 ponds in the working area, with an area of more than 2.8 million square feet. Twelve mosquito catching stations were selected in the whole area, all of which are located in sheds with dark light or special environments such as raising livestock, and the whole area is divided into six small areas, each small area is divided into three small groups, and each small group is sent by the coolies to implement the work, catching larvae and adult mosquitoes. The mosquito killing drugs are Paris green (road gray) and anti-malaria oil. Methods of killing mosquitoes: (A) Spraying Paris green ash and anti-malaria oil, mixing 1% Paris green with road gray, and spreading it on the water surface of ponds that produce malaria mosquitoes with a spraying device to kill the larvae. Repeating every seven days, or spraying the water surface with mosquito-killing oil in the same way to suffocate and kill various mosquito larvae. (Mosquito-killing oil is four times more expensive than Paris green ash, but saves 30 times in labor costs, but it is not suitable for rice fields, so the two should be used separately.) (B) Using fish and penguins to swallow larvae and duckweed can also suffocate and kill the larvae. (C) Removing weeds. Ditches where mosquito larvae are produced often have weeds growing on the banks, which provide a place for the larvae to hide. Removing the weeds makes it easier to kill the larvae. (D) Filling in ditches. Mosquito larvae are prone to breed in stagnant ponds or pits, so the ditches in the city should be filled in or dredged to reduce the water surface where mosquitoes breed and facilitate water circulation. However, this kind of work requires a large amount of manpower to achieve significant results, so it is handled by the Works Bureau and the Cleaning Corps. Nanjing has a vast area. Although anti-malaria work has been promoted, it is difficult to spread it to the whole city. Often, some institutions are not in the anti-malaria area and request assistance from the Health Office. The office does its best to provide guidance. For example, the Xiaolongwei Education Corps has achieved remarkable results after implementing anti-malaria work this year.</p>
<p>2. Future plans (A) Expand the scope of work, with the city wall as the boundary, and it is estimated that the area within three kilometers outside the city in the densely populated areas of Xiaguan and Chengnan will be the protected area. (B) Stagnant water removal. The stagnant water of the Qinhuai River and the Taiping tanks in various streets and alleys in the Nanjing anti-malaria area have not been implemented and checked due to the weakness of funds and manpower. The office believes that this kind of work cannot be effectively implemented without the cooperation of all citizens, so it plans to expand publicity in order to encourage citizens to automatically reduce the water surface where mosquito larvae are produced or dredge stagnant water to achieve perfection.</p>
<h3>Taicang: Please Exempt the Peppermint Oil Distilling Tax</h3>
<p>Taicang's soil is suitable, and the quality of peppermint is better than in other places, and it is famous all over the world. It has repeatedly won medals at domestic and foreign product exhibitions, so the sales are quite broad. In recent years, all industries have been declining, and the social economy has been deteriorating. Farmers still adhere to the old methods and do not make improvements, resulting in the world-renowned peppermint losing its fame. Factories monopolize the market, making it unprofitable for farmers, so they switch to growing other crops. The production of peppermint is decreasing year by year, and the future of agriculture is worrying. In view of this, Wang Jitong and others in Nanjiao Town established a cooperative distillery to distill oil themselves to avoid being controlled by manufacturers. Since it is not a business nature, there is no need to collect business tax. As an example, the drying stoves of silkworm farmers in Xichang have the same nature. If this is advocated, the output will inevitably increase, and farmers can rely on it for profit. Wang Jitong and others have submitted a report to the county magistrate requesting tax exemption and asking for protection to benefit the rural areas.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Boiler Explosion Injured Four People</h3>
<p>The Suzhou Provincial Industrial School in Sanyuanfang has not yet started school after the summer vacation. A part of its workshop is rented to the Aonan Tongsheng Yarn Factory to practice making cloth. Yesterday (21st) at 2:30 p.m., while the cloth was being practiced, the boiler suddenly exploded due to excessive temperature, rushing upwards and piercing the roof. A workshop house collapsed, and four workers, including Sheng Aqi, and workers surnamed Li and Pan, were injured all over their bodies and fainted. They were rushed to the Wuxian County Hospital for treatment, and their lives were in great danger.</p>
<h3>A Misunderstanding Over Grass Cutting Causes a Conflict</h3>
<p>Due to a misunderstanding, farmers from Wu Xiang, Jing, thought that Lu Dingbang, a farmer from the same village, was cutting rice when he went to Donghe Zhaiqiao the other day to cut grass for his cattle. Chen Changfa and others gathered a crowd to drive him away, causing Lu Dingbang to jump into the river and drown, which caused great anger. Therefore, on the 21st, they gathered more than one hundred people, divided into more than thirty agricultural boats, and rushed to Donghe Zhaiqiao. Without asking any questions, they recklessly cut down unripe rice in the fields. As a result, more than one hundred farmers from that village also gathered, each holding wooden sticks and other agricultural tools, intending to fight the farmers from Wu Yang Jing. The local Bao reported it to the police district, and Patrol Officer Yang led the police to rush there to suppress the situation and persuade the farmers to reconcile. Fortunately, a major disaster was averted, and the farmers from Wu Yang Jing immediately left. However, a large amount of rice in the fields had been cut down, resulting in considerable losses. The police district sent the father of the deceased, Lu Wen'an, and the accused Chen Changfa and Chen Ronggen, to the Public Security Bureau. On the 22nd, the Judicial Section interrogated them once and then transferred them to the Procuratorate of the District Court for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Local Self-Government Association</h3>
<p>The Wu County Local Self-Government Research Association was initiated by more than ten people, including Ye Zhongliang, the head of Ganjiang Town, and was approved by the county party headquarters for organization. On the morning of the 22nd, the inaugural meeting was held, attended by more than eighty members. Party and government agencies sent personnel to provide guidance. The presidium consisted of Ye Zhongliang, Fan Junbo, and Lu Yiran. After the opening ceremony, Ye Zhongliang, Fan Junbo, Fan Yunshu, Gu Baiyu, Xi Zhonghong, Lu Yiran, Xu Wenya, Zhang Tianyu, Zhang Zhiming, Ge Peizhi, and Feng Jingkun were elected as eleven executive committee members. Bian Shou, Peng, Zhang Zengxiang, and Shen Jinqing were elected as alternates. The first executive committee meeting was held in the afternoon, and Fan Junbo, Ye Zhongliang, and Fan Yunshu were elected as standing committee members, with Ye Zhongliang elected as chairman by mutual vote. At 3 p.m., a discussion meeting was held with the heads of all townships in the county to discuss matters related to self-government.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: The Inside Story of Yu Lili's Arrest</h3>
<p>Xiao Wawa (i.e., Yu Lili), the leading actress of the Shanghai Beach opera at the Phoenix Hall of the Great World Amusement Park in this city, and her father, Yu Ruixiang, were suddenly arrested by the procuratorate of the court the night before last. They were interrogated overnight, and released on bail the next day. It is now known that the content of the case is murder. On the 14th of this month, a nameless male corpse with knife wounds was found in the river at Bridge No. 152 on the Jinghu Road near the Xi Xun Township in the second district of the county. The upper body was wearing a white vest, and the lower body was wearing foreign gauze pants and black socks. Wu Liping, a male actor of the Shanghai Beach opera at the Great World, suddenly disappeared on the 8th of this month, and his life and death are still unknown. The clothes worn by the male corpse were roughly the same as those worn by Wu Liping. Therefore, the arrest of the Xiao Wawa and her father this time was due to someone accusing them of murder. Prosecutor Shen of the court, for the sake of further investigation, summoned Xiao Wawa, Yu Ruixiang, and related persons Shi Shaoqing (father of Shi Xiangyun), Yan Chungeng, and Yang Liansheng for further questioning. After two hours of questioning, he ordered Yu Ruixiang to provide an additional written guarantee of 5,000 yuan, and Shi Shaoqing and Yan Chungeng to be released on bail. Yang Liansheng was still detained because of a smoking case. Xiao Wawa was temporarily taken back by her mother, Yu Xu. However, Yu Ruixiang was immediately detained because he was unable to find a guarantor.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Crackdown on Gratuities Causes Panic</h3>
<p>The Wuyi New Movement Promotion Association recently received an order from the general association regarding the acceptance of gratuities in hotels, bathhouses, restaurants, theaters, and public entertainment venues. In addition to adding one to the original bill, no extra gratuities may be accepted, and the enforcement measures were promulgated for implementation. The association immediately convened a meeting of the relevant industries and decided that the relevant industries should negotiate their own measures before implementing them separately. However, the hotel industry and other industries were greatly panicked by the crackdown measures. The situation was the same in other counties. The hotel industry also sent members Wu Xitang and Su Zhixiang, along with two tea attendants, to Wuxi to investigate first. On the 21st, they went to Zhenjiang to investigate. It is said that they have not yet been implemented. They also plan to jointly petition the National Government with various counties in Jiangsu and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Fugitive Arrested and Dies by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Xia Shunxiang, a native of Changjing Town in the fifth district, was found in possession of poison pills in September of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. He was arrested and sent to the county by the town's business group and sentenced to two years in prison. On December 9th, Xia colluded with guard Tu Shifeng and escaped under the pretext of going to Renji Hospital for medical treatment. He has been missing for more than two years. The day before yesterday, Xia suddenly returned secretly and was reported to Wang Cuiwu of the militia team, who arrested Xia and hired a boat to transport him to the city. At about 10 p.m. on the 20th, when the boat arrived at Lujiaqiao, Xia suddenly died. According to the circumstances, it seemed that he had died by taking poison. On the 21st, Yuan County Magistrate was reported, and on the morning of the 22nd, Investigator Shen and Coroner Cao went to examine the body.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Sun Lianzhong Inspects Nantong</h3>
<p>Sun Lianzhong, the Commander-in-Chief of the 26th Route Army, came to Nantong on the 20th during his inspection tour from Huaiyang. He inspected and addressed the troops stationed there. Commander-in-Chief Sun stayed at the Wanghailou in Langshan. After completing his official duties in Nantong, he went to Rufou.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Cargo Ship Robbed En Route</h3>
<p>The cargo ship sailing from Jiaxing to Pinghu was jointly operated by Ge Jinshan from Tangwan Street, Beimen, Jiaxing, and the ship owner. On the 19th, the ship sailed from Jiaxing to Pinghu. At about 8 p.m., when the ship passed the Hongmiao River surface of Jiaoshanmen, Hantang, Xinfeng, a Jiangbei boat suddenly came head-on. There were nine bandits on board, all with white towels wrapped around their heads, holding guns and iron bars. They jumped onto the ship and threatened them to be silent. They tied up the five people on the ship with ropes and carried out a large-scale search and robbery. They moved the robbed goods into the bandit ship. Ge Jinshan took the opportunity to swim to the shore and shouted for the arrest of the bandits. The three robbers heard the sound and also went ashore to chase. The bandit ship then sailed away. The ship crew reported to the Xinfeng Public Security Bureau, which sent police to pursue them, but the bandits had disappeared. Ge Jinshan also disappeared. Until the 21st, Ge's body was found in the Taojin River channel, but there was a gunshot wound in his head, which seemed to have been shot by the bandits and fell into the river and died. When the family received the news, they went to collect the body.</p>
<h3>Funing: Continuous Rain Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>Since spring, this county has not had heavy rain and has been unusually dry, causing saltwater to backflow and rice seedlings to dry up. Unexpectedly, in the past month, there have been continuous rains, about one foot in depth. Although the water has receded, the cotton fields in the low-lying areas have been flooded. At 8 a.m. this morning, there was a sudden heavy rain in Qitao, a place in the north of this county, which lasted until 12 noon. The rainfall was more than one foot and two inches. The autumn crops and cotton fields in that area have all become a swamp and have been completely flooded. The disaster is already formed, and the affected people are crying and wailing, which is a very tragic situation.</p>
<h3>An Estimate of Germany's Fighting Strength (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— By French General X, translated by Yue Qi</p>
<p>The question of Germany's military strength has once again attracted the attention of the world due to its violation of the Treaty of Locarno and its re-militarization of the Rhineland. In particular, the French list the types and quantities of German troops, tanks, and aircraft in newspapers every day. They compare German armaments with their own in order to judge the outcome of future wars. This is not surprising, because, in addition to relying on military organizations in peacetime, ordinary people probably do not know what to use to estimate the fighting strength of any country.</p>
<p>However, the standing army necessary for fighting the enemy is only a small part of the belligerent's armed forces. After a few weeks of the outbreak of the war, the expeditionary army has all set off, the ammunition stored in the warehouse will soon be exhausted, and most of the new and complete aircraft have been damaged. At this time, if any country neglects the organization of the reserve army and the replenishment of military supplies, neglects the planning of transportation, and neglects the opening and closing of roads convenient for troop mobilization, then the country will inevitably collapse in the end, although it had achieved amazing victories in the early stages of the war.</p>
<p>It is a dangerous and serious mistake to estimate the fighting strength of any country based solely on the standing army. In addition to recognizing the existing military strength, we should also consider how much value this military strength has in wartime, what internal resources can be used to maintain the army, and what sources of armed forces are hidden. In short, we should consider the country's entire "military potential."</p>
<p>Thus, in order to predict the outcome of future wars, what we should understand is not Germany's current state of armaments but Germany's entire potential fighting strength.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to calculating the number of soldiers, guns, and aircraft, we have examined Germany's commercial intelligence reports, its statistical tables, and its factory accounts; we have calculated its reserve military strength; we have studied its economic organization and human resources. Only from the figures obtained from these examinations can we estimate Germany's fighting strength. Anything else is either speculation or fiction.</p>
<p>The question is: Can Germany survive in wartime? Can it fight for a long time? How effective will its manpower and transportation be in wartime? These are the questions we want to examine.</p>
<p>In order to survive and be able to fight, people must eat. Can Germany's soil supply the country's food? This is a question of primary importance. In 1918, the German front and rear troops collapsed due to a lack of bread. How much progress has Germany made in food preparation since being taught a lesson? Will an economic blockade cause the same tragedy as in 1918? Let's start by answering this question?</p>
<p>Let us look at Germany's agricultural production statistics. Since 1932, wheat production has exceeded consumption. At the same time, wheat imports have only slightly declined, while exports have been shrinking day by day. For example, in 1933, Germany imported 770,000 tons of wheat and exported only 536,000 tons; in 1934, the wheat import surplus increased to 450,000 tons.</p>
<p>This clearly shows that Germany is actively storing food. In January 1935, Germany had 4 million tons of wheat in storage—enough to last a year. The Germans have not forgotten the tragedy of 1918; they do not want to fight hungry again!</p>
<p>Let's talk about rye again. Since 1933, Germany's rye production has been sufficient to offset consumption. In early 1935, Germany's rye reserves reached 5 million tons, most of which were imported from abroad in January 1935. In 1932, Germany's rye exports exceeded imports. By 1934, imports exceeded exports by 25,099 tons; rye imports in January 1935 were 80 times higher than rye imports in January 1934, while exports decreased month by month during the same period.</p>
<p>Potatoes are already overproduced in Germany, but imports are still increasing. In 1933, 70,000 tons were imported; in 1934, it increased to 110,000 tons. The same is true for beet sugar. Beet sugar imports in 1935 were five times higher than in 1934, while exports decreased significantly. The fact that imports are not reduced due to overproduction is clear evidence of efforts to store them.</p>
<p>Germany's livestock production is sufficient for consumption but without surplus. Currently, Germany is also working hard to increase livestock production; last year, the production of pigs, which are particularly needed for producing fat, increased by 8% compared to the previous year. As for edible fat, production is not enough for consumption. To make up for this shortcoming, Germany is planning to grow soybeans.</p>
<p>Thus, if Germany is blockaded in wartime, it can still continue to survive. Of all the foods, it lacks only fat. Germany's agriculture is enough to feed the people and the army.</p>

<h3>National Election Office: Received Explanation from the General Office Yesterday; Specialized Schools Cannot Be Considered the Same as Independent Colleges</h3>
<p>The National Assembly election of representatives of free professional groups includes educational associations, universities, and independent colleges, but there are no clear regulations regarding national or private specialized schools. Whether or not they can also participate in the election has been questioned by various parties to the National Assembly Representative Election Office in this city. Therefore, the National Assembly Free Professional Group Representative Election Office was consulted by letter for clarification. It is now known that the National Election Office in this city received a reply yesterday with the number Zi Zi No. 102, stating that it had been approved by the General Office, "According to the University Organization Law (independent colleges are permitted to use this law, which clearly states in Article 23 that it is distinctly different from the provisions of the Specialized School Organization Law; this is one. Furthermore, there are also many differences in Chapter 2 of the University Faculty Qualification Regulations regarding qualification regulations; this is two. Based on the above two points, since the National or Private Specialized School Election Law is not listed, it cannot be considered an independent college and should not be allowed to participate in the election." The office must have ordered notification.</p>
<h3>Citizens to Re-Register for Citizenship; Multiple Registration Offices to Be Established; Lawyers Association Sworn in Yesterday; People from Four Provinces to Be Sworn in Today</h3>
<p>The city-wide citizen registration for citizenship, since the National Election Office sent personnel to distribute registration forms on the 18th and collected them on the 19th, could have been immediately processed for swearing-in and completion of procedures. However, the Shanghai area is vast and densely populated. Even though the office dispatched all its personnel, there is still concern that there will be some shops and households in various lanes that have not received registration forms. A remedy must be formulated to ensure that nothing is missed. According to news from the National Election Office, the office has decided to establish a number of citizenship re-registration offices based on the density of the population in each area and the distance of the roads. The dates and locations are roughly planned and will be determined and announced in the near future. At that time, anyone who has not obtained a registration form or has filled it out but not submitted it can go to the nearest office to contact them for collection or submission. Before this measure is implemented, citizens who need registration forms can directly request them from the office by letter.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association held a citizenship swearing-in registration at its office on Beile Road yesterday morning, starting at 9:00 a.m., with the participation of about a thousand people, chaired by Jiang Yiping, Qin Liankui, and Chen Tingrui, with Wang Manyun as the police supervisor. People from the four northeastern provinces living in Shanghai will hold a supplementary swearing-in at the Xiaoximen Juvenile Propaganda Group starting at 9:00 a.m. today.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Agricultural Warehouse Loan Successful; China Farmers Bank to Provide Loan</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Wu Tingyang, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction, has come to Shanghai several times to raise funds for the construction of five major agricultural provincial warehouses and discussed borrowing money with Zhu Runsheng, manager of the Shanghai branch of the China Farmers Bank. The reporter learned from the bank yesterday afternoon that the agricultural warehouse loan has been negotiated and finalized. The total amount is 400,000 yuan. The method is that the China Farmers Bank will lend 280,000 yuan to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, with the five major agricultural warehouses in Zhejiang Province as collateral. The Zhejiang Provincial Government will self-subscribe 30%, which is 120,000 yuan, and pledge 200,000 yuan face value of the Zhejiang Provincial Consolidation Public Bonds to the China Farmers Bank at a 60% discount to borrow 120,000 yuan. The draft loan contract has been negotiated and will be signed by the Hangzhou Office of the China Farmers Bank and the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The locations of the five major warehouses have been surveyed and determined as five places including Xiashi, Taizhou, Yueqing, Jinhua, and Haimen. After the Provincial Warehouse Management Committee is established on the 28th of this month, preparations and construction will begin, and it is expected to be completed next spring. The working capital of 3 million yuan for future storage, mortgage, and lending has also been agreed in principle with the China Farmers Bank, and the detailed methods will be negotiated and decided after the warehouse is completed.</p>

<p>Coming to Shanghai to Solicit Opinions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flour Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association have separately requested the Ministry of Industries, one advocating banning exports to maintain the people's food supply, and the other advocating exporting to maintain the rural economy. The two sides have different views. In order to handle the matter carefully, the ministry, in addition to ordering the affiliated Agricultural Production Improvement Institute to conduct a detailed survey of wheat production, also sent Zhou Yichun, Deputy Minister of Industries, to Shanghai yesterday to contact all parties, collect their opinions, and consult the financial community. The results of the consultations will be submitted to the ministry for detailed planning and research and submitted to an expert meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>Investigation Completed</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau has not received a request to aid wheat from the flour and miscellaneous grains industries associations, the matter concerns the people's food supply, which is its responsibility. Therefore, it ordered the Food Supply Section of the Fourth Division to send personnel to various relevant groups for investigation. It has been ten days since the investigation work began, and it is now known that the work has been completed. A report is being drafted and submitted to the director for review before a plan is determined. It is also heard that the bureau will convene a grain committee within days to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Continue to Purchase</p>
<p>Since Japanese merchants began purchasing new wheat from China, the amount has reached 300,000 bags, which have been shipped to Dalian, Korea, and other places. According to the Da Gong News Agency reporter, Japanese merchants continue to entrust inland merchants and brokers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to purchase wheat on their behalf and ship it to Shanghai one after another. However, it has been found that the wheat purchased by Japanese merchants is all second and third-grade inferior goods, so the market price is 4.12 yuan per 100 catties.</p>
<h3>Luo Qinghua Went to Beijing Last Night to Present Opinions on Revising Industrial and Commercial Laws; Representatives of Various Industry Associations Went to the Station to See Him Off</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce members' representative meeting this year resolved to request the revision of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law and the Chamber of Commerce Law to improve the organization of merchants. The Executive Committee of the Chamber of Commerce handed it over to the Business Committee to jointly draft a concrete plan with the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Committee. Luo Qinghua, director of the Business Committee, convened several joint meetings and tentatively drafted 41 articles of the Chamber of Commerce Law, 17 articles of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law, 45 articles of the Chamber of Commerce Law Enforcement Rules, and 14 articles of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law Enforcement Rules, which were sent to the fourth Executive Committee meeting of the Chamber of Commerce for approval. Luo Qinghua was recommended to go to Beijing to present the revision opinions to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Industries. Luo left by train for Beijing at 11 p.m. last night. The various industry associations, considering the matter to be a long-standing issue of great concern to them, which they hoped would be resolved, went to the station to see him off. Those who arrived included Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Tu Kaiwei, Zhou Bangjun, Chen Ziyi, Zhang Yuchi, and Xu Guanqun from the cotton cloth industry, paper industry, chemical raw materials industry, woolen industry, machinery dyeing and weaving industry, mineral ash factory industry, new medicine industry, flosss industry, miscellaneous grain oil cake industry, bean rice industry, national rubber products industry, and pharmaceutical factory industry, and more than 50 other people. Before leaving, Luo told the reporter that since the National Government promulgated the Industrial and Commercial Associations Law in 1929, the establishment of associations and the joining and leaving of members have been purely based on free and laissez-faire principles, resulting in the inability to improve the organization of merchants and the inability to implement industry regulations. Therefore, chambers of commerce in various places have filed requests for revision. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has also had this case at previous congresses. I have been to Beijing several times for this matter to petition the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Industries. Although the Legislative Yuan changed the word "may" to "shall" in Article 7 of the Association Law, which stated that one "may" join an industry association, ultimately, there were no sanctioning measures, making it impossible for the competent authorities to enforce it. Last month, I accompanied representatives of 21 provincial and municipal chambers of commerce to Beijing to reiterate the previous request. At that time, the authorities of the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Industries also realized that it was necessary to revise the industrial and commercial laws and regulations and improve the organization of merchants in light of the international situation. They instructed me to return to Shanghai to draft concrete opinions and submit them for reference. The Business Committee and the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Committee have held a total of eight meetings in the past month and have received the meticulous assistance and discussion of experts and representatives from various industries, which has been quite detailed. There are many changes, additions, and deletions to the original law. In summary: (1) Companies and firms with seven or more businesses in the same industry must establish an industry association. If there are fewer than seven but three or more businesses in the same industry, they may also establish one with the permission of the competent authorities. (2) Chambers of commerce should be established in cities directly under the Executive Yuan and in various cities and counties. However, prosperous areas and towns may also establish them independently or jointly. (3) Companies and firms should join the industry association. If they do not join, they may be fined up to 500 yuan and forced to join. (4) Industry associations should join the chamber of commerce as members. If they do not join or do not fulfill their obligations, they may be reorganized or disciplined. There are many other revisions, and the full text will be published in detail in the next issue of the Commercial Monthly. Yesterday, the Executive Committee of this newspaper believed that it was necessary to present all the drafts and revisions to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Industries in person. Therefore, I was recommended to go to Beijing. Tomorrow is a weekly holiday. After I arrive in Beijing, I plan to visit Zhang, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industries, first and take the opportunity to have a detailed discussion. On Monday, I will present my opinions to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Industries separately. After returning to Shanghai, I will report everything to the Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Korean Independence Party – Plot to Bomb Japanese Consulate</h3>
<p>Translated from the Shanghai Daily News by the Foreign Press: "The Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council discovered the body of a man who died suddenly in the Concession at dawn on the 20th. After a thorough investigation, the body was identified as Korean and the Japanese Consulate General’s Police Department was notified. The Korean section of the second division of the Japanese Consulate General immediately dispatched personnel to examine the body and search the residence. As a result, serious doubts arose regarding the cause of death. Important books and other items were confiscated, and it was determined that an injured person currently hospitalized was related to the deceased. The situation is extremely tense, and detectives have been dispatched to investigate all angles. The shocking facts of the death and injury have been revealed: both were members of a terrorist group within the Korean independence movement, plotting to bomb the Japanese Consulate General. While manufacturing a bomb, it exploded, killing one and injuring the other. Japanese authorities are currently maintaining strict secrecy regarding this incident. On the 21st, Police Inspector Fujii of the Japanese Consulate went to the French Municipal Council to claim the body, which has already been cremated in the Japanese cemetery. The progress of this incident is highly noteworthy, and it is possible that even more terrifying secrets may be revealed."</p>
<h3>Liping Steamer – Telegram Reports Grounding – Shanghai Company Has Sent Telegram for Inquiry</h3>
<p>The Liping Steamer, owned by the Liping Company, has a deadweight of 3,200 tons, a draft of 18 feet, and a speed of 18 knots per hour. It was carrying a full load of salt from Haizhou to the Yangtze River. However, after leaving Haizhou and reaching the Chang Harbor entrance, the tide receded, and the ship was too heavily loaded, causing it to run aground and become deeply embedded in the shallows. The captain tried to reverse with full power but was unable to free the ship. He then telegraphed Shanghai, requesting assistance from the company. Upon receiving the report, the Liping Company informed the insurance company and telegraphed the Haizhou branch manager, instructing them to dispatch a ship to unload the salt in case the ship could not be freed when the tide rose. However, even when the tide rose yesterday afternoon at 8 PM, the ship remained stuck in the shallows. The Shanghai company has sent a telegram to inquire whether the bottom of the ship has been damaged and a diver needs to inspect it. A major loss of the salt cargo will occur if the ship is flooded. Currently, unloading the salt is the only way to dislodge the ship.</p>

<h3>Dutch East Indies Restricting Import Goods – National Trade Bureau Asks All Industries to Take Note</h3>

<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Strictly Investigates Opium Smokers – Issues Household Certificates and Pledges – Landlords or Heads of Households Jointly Liable</h3>
<p>Shen Shi News reports: As the registration of opium smokers by the Municipal Police Bureau is nearing completion, there are bound to be a few opium smokers in the city who have not registered or are even trying to profit by secretly opening opium dens for sale and consumption. To strictly ban the sale and consumption of opium and complete the registration work, it is essential to implement a household guarantee system. The Bureau had previously drafted "Measures for Investigating Opium Smoker Registration Household Pledges and Certificates" and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and record. Several hundred thousand copies of the pledges have now been printed and distributed to each branch and office, with police officers assigned to distribute them door-to-door, requiring them to be filled out and submitted within one week. After this pledge, if opium dens or unregistered opium smokers are discovered again, the opium offenders will be handed over for investigation along with the landlords or heads of households who made the pledge. The aforementioned guarantee measures are recorded below: (2) In order to thoroughly ban opium dens and investigate unregistered opium smokers, this Bureau has specially created Household Certificates and Pledges, which will be delivered by each branch and office, dispatched by police officers to each household, and the households will be earnestly informed to comply with the completion and submission; (1) All households residing within the jurisdiction of this city, upon receiving this certificate and pledge, if there are no unregistered opium smokers within the household, the landlord should immediately fill out and submit the certificate and pledge to the relevant branch office within one week for reporting and filing (if only one family resides in the household, the head of the household should provide the pledge and certificate); (1) All households residing within the jurisdiction of this city, upon receiving this certificate and pledge, should conduct a strict investigation of co-residents. If any unregistered opium smokers are discovered, they should be advised to register in accordance with the regulations. If they refuse to comply, they should be reported to the relevant branch office; (1) If, after a household has filled out and submitted the certificate and pledge, it is subsequently discovered that there are still unregistered opium smokers within the residence, the landlord who issued the pledge shall, in accordance with the provisions of item C of Article 5 of the Measures for the Registration of Opium Smokers within the Prescribed Time Limit, and the persons certifying those receiving pauper's certificates, be held liable for false reporting and shielding and concealing, and shall be fined from five yuan to thirty yuan, depending on the circumstances. Those who are unable to pay the fine may commute it to detention at a rate of two yuan per day; (2) If, after a household has filled out and submitted the certificate and pledge, it is subsequently discovered that opium smokers residing within the household are opening opium dens for sale and consumption, the incriminating evidence should be seized immediately and the landlord who issued the pledge should be handed over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation; (1) If a household that has filled out and submitted the certificate and pledge is found to be smoking opium without registering, they shall be handed over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for punishment; (1) All police officers should faithfully perform their duties. If there is any collusion, shielding, or malpractice, the head of the relevant branch office shall be responsible for reporting and requesting punishment in accordance with the law; (1) If there are any matters not covered by these measures, they may be submitted to the Municipal Government for amendment and supplementation at any time; (1) These measures shall be implemented after being submitted by this Bureau to the Municipal Government for approval, and the same shall apply to any amendments.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Announces Citizen Origin and Religion</h3>
<p>Da Gong News reports: The Second Section of the Municipal Police Bureau announced yesterday the analysis of the origin and religious beliefs of the city's citizens, as follows:</p>
<p>Population Origin: The Second Section of the Public Security Bureau announced yesterday the population analysis of citizens in the city, as follows: Jiangsu Province: 848,560 people, Anhui Province: 91,478 people, Zhejiang Province: 398,710 people, Fujian Province: 12,036 people, Jiangxi Province: 10,310 people, Hubei Province: 33,872 people, Hunan Province: 15,049 people, Guangdong Province: 53,861 people, Guangxi Province: 503 people, Yunnan Province: 215 people, Guizhou Province: 165 people, Sichuan Province: 2,519 people, Gansu Province: 28 people, Shaanxi Province: 205 people, Henan Province: 9,374 people, Hebei Province: 32,012 people, Shandong Province: 33,965 people, Shanxi Province: 404 people, Liaoning Province: 69 people, Jilin Province: 91 people, Heilongjiang Province: 41 people, Suiyuan Province: 5 people, Chahar Province: 2 people, Xinjiang Province: 6 people, Qinghai Province: 1 person, Mongolian Province: 2 people, Tibetan Province: 1 person, Shanghai City: 505,900 people, Nanjing City: 31,976 people, Qingdao City: 521 people, Beijing City: 6,584 people, for a total of 2,089,077 residents in the city.</p>
<p>Religious Denominations: The types of religions and population numbers in the city are as follows: monks: 1,173 people, Taoist priests: 669 people, nuns: 465 people, Taoist priestesses: 110 people, Islam: 7,141 people, Catholicism: 19,129 people, Protestantism: 12,068 people, for a total of 40,845 people.</p>
<p>Explanation: It has been found that among the various religious beliefs of the people in this city, Catholicism and Protestantism are the most popular. The number of monks and Taoist priests is less than two-tenths of the number of Catholics. This is due to the changes in social customs in recent years and the gradual elimination of superstition, which has naturally led to a decrease. The number of Muslims is over 7,000, which is relatively high because Muslims are present in all occupations.</p>
<h3>Northwest Industrial Promotion Association Seeks Participation from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The preparatory office of the Northwest Industrial Promotion Association, in order to actively advance the association's affairs, seek to develop the Northwest and Tibet, and promote the revitalization of industry to consolidate the national foundation, yesterday specially sent letters inviting prominent figures from all sectors of industry, finance, commerce, and others nationwide to participate in the initiation. The original letter stated, "Greetings. At this time of severe national crisis and economic hardship, the necessities of food, clothing, housing, and transportation for the entire country are mostly dependent on foreign countries. The outflow of money is enormous every year. If we do not quickly seek remedies, the branches will wither and the leaves will decay, and collapse will be imminent. However, the provinces of our Northwest are fertile and rich in resources, and the mineral deposits have long been known to be abundant. However, due to successive years of disasters and a lack of development, vast fertile lands are sparsely populated, and barren fields are everywhere. We, the undersigned, recognizing this, have taken the liberty of initiating the establishment of the Northwest Industrial Promotion Association, gathering collective strength to seek development, and uniting the will of the people to promote it. We are willing to contribute our spiritual and material resources to the exploration of mineral deposits and the revitalization of industry, striving to ensure that the treasures of nature are not abandoned to the earth and that the produced raw materials can be fully utilized. This will not only prevent financial leakage and maintain the nation's vitality but also provide a good way to benefit the people's livelihood and consolidate the foundation of the nation. However, we are ashamed of our limited capabilities. The light of a firefly is difficult to illuminate the sky. We sincerely fear that the great plan of developing treasures and revitalizing industry cannot be achieved solely by the wisdom of a few colleagues. We have long admired your reputation in the government and among the people, your love for the country, your service to society, and your contributions to the welfare of the people. We dare to send this letter inviting you to participate in the initiation, so that with a call from above, the people will respond in droves, and the cause of developing the Northwest can be realized. The nation will be fortunate, the people's livelihood will be fortunate. We eagerly await your response."</p>
<h3>National Anti-Smuggling Association Circular to Chambers of Commerce Nationwide: Expedite the Formation of Anti-Smuggling Committees</h3>
<p>The National Anti-Smuggling Association yesterday issued a notice to chambers of commerce in all provinces and cities, instructing them to promptly organize anti-smuggling committees in accordance with the organizational rules for anti-smuggling committees of local chambers of commerce. Those that have already been formed should also correct their names in accordance with the rules to ensure uniformity.

<h3>Daishan Fishing and Salt Workers' Tragedy: Coerced Participants Exempted from Prosecution; Salt Transport Commissioner Cables Yu Qiaqing</h3>
<p>Zhou Zonghua, the Salt Transport Commissioner of Liangzhe, yesterday cabled the Ningbo Fellow Association regarding the Daishan fishing and salt workers' riot, stating that there would be no leniency in the punishment of the instigators, and that those who were coerced would be treated leniently. As for future measures, special attention would be paid. The original telegram stated, "To Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the Shanghai Ningbo Native Association, Greetings. I have received your telegram with respect. Upon investigation of the Daishan fishing and salt workers' riot, they committed murder and arson, and did everything possible. Their cruelty and brutality were even worse than bandits. Upon review of the circumstances, it is clear that there is a reactionary background, and there are many who are instigating from the middle. The commissioner has no leniency for the culprits and instigators and will severely punish them according to the law, but those who blindly follow coercion will be treated leniently, which is in line with the views of all parties. Therefore, since the incident, I have ordered the newly appointed acting Daishan Field Chief to issue a notice to reassure the people, exempt those who were coerced from prosecution, and promptly restore the various bureaus to normal operations to maintain the livelihoods of the salt workers and stabilize local order. The increased police force has also been transferred back. Turning fishermen and salt into different colors, and piles of salt by women, are all essential plans for organizing production and sales, and also preliminary measures for implementing the new salt law. They do not hinder the interests of genuine fishermen and salt workers, and it seems inappropriate to reject food because of choking. However, special attention should be paid to all subsequent measures, and orders have been given to handle them properly. I am sending this telegram in response, and I hope you will investigate and take note of it. Concurrently, Zhou Zonghua, Salt Transport Commissioner of Liangzhe, seal."</p>

<h3>Lü Fangzheng Forges 100,000 Auxiliary Currency Notes, Sentenced; Liu Peiqing's Suspicion Lacks Evidence; Lü Sentenced to Five Years, Printing Plates Confiscated</h3>
<p>Lü Fangzheng, a Hubei native who used to be a doctor, forged a letter of entrustment from Jia Shiyi, the manager of the Hubei Provincial Bank, and commissioned Liu Peiqing, the owner of the Huashu Engraving Company at No. 25 Maoyi Lane, No. 153 Meibaige Road, to print 100,000 auxiliary currency notes of five jiao each for the Hubei Provincial Bank. Lü took them to Hubei, but they were seized in Xiaguan, Nanjing. Lü took the opportunity to escape and returned to Shanghai, intending to retrieve the copperplate model, but was reported to the Xinzha police station by Liu Peiqing, who sent detectives to arrest Lü Fangzheng and hand him over to the First Special Court for prosecution according to law. During the trial, it was discovered that Liu Peiqing was suspected of colluding, and the police station was ordered to detain and investigate him. After investigation by the police station, although Liu Peiqing's suspicion was strong, there was no evidence, so the detention was revoked. As for Lü Fangzheng's part, the debate concluded, and yesterday morning, Judge Tan Xinzhen presided over the Eighth Criminal Court and announced the verdict: Lü Fangzheng intended to use them and forged common banknotes, sentenced to five years of imprisonment, eight engraving plates, two engraving molds, and forged letters were all confiscated.</p>

<h3>Minsheng Industrial Company's New Round of Minben Trial Run</h3>
<p>The two heavy-duty giant ships Minyuan and Minben, which were commissioned by the Shanghai branch of Minsheng Industrial Company to be built by the Navy Dingnan Shipyard, held launching ceremonies separately at the end of June. The deck work has now been completed and is expected to sail between Shanghai and Chongqing at the end of this month.

The ship is 220 feet long and 33 feet wide, with a load of 600 tons. There are special equipment, including a very large cold storage, which can be used for transporting fruits and seafood back and forth. There are also two cranes, each capable of lifting 25 tons of cargo at the same time. As for its speed, after the test run at the Wusongkou, the average speed reached more than 16 nautical miles per hour in four round trips. Moreover, everything on the ship, whether passenger or cargo, ranks first in the Yangtze River shipping industry. Those who know it call it the "Queen Mary of the Inland River," which is not an overstatement.</p>
<h3>Sand Ship Sinks After Hitting Reef, Fifteen Drowned, Loss of 30,000 Gold</h3>
<p>The sand ship Jinxinsheng, loaded with 1,245 bags of brown sugar in Xiamen, was sailing through the Yushan waters outside Wusongkou at about 3 pm the day before yesterday when it suddenly encountered a reef, broke the bottom of the ship, and seawater poured in. At that time, it was impossible to block it, and the entire ship sank. There were a total of 18 people on board, including the shipowner Ding Zhichen and crew member Xu Asheng, all of whom fell into the water. Only Xu Alv, Saisheng, and Shen Chuncheng drifted on the sea for two hours and were rescued by fishing boats, and were fortunate to survive. The shipowner Ding Zhichen and 15 others were tragically drowned, and the loss of the ship and cargo was about 30,000 gold. It is truly a tragic shipping accident.</p>

<h3>Prisoner Repeatedly Sends Letters, Fearing Extortion; Defendant's Name Does Not Match, Rescheduled for Interrogation on the 29th</h3>
<p>Shen Fushou, a native of Ningbo, 50 years old, the manager of the Xiehe Transfer Company at the South Railway Station and chairman of the Transfer Industry Association, had lived with the aunt of Ji Xilin (i.e., Qian Xilin, also known as Qian Yongchun, who is currently arrested and sentenced to prison for theft) in 1920. In 1929, when Ji's aunt died, Ji had been to Shen's house, so he knew Shen Jiefu. Ji's father also worked for Shen. Last year, Ji was sentenced to prison for theft and sent to prison. Since January of this year, he has repeatedly sent letters to Shen, asking for financial assistance. The wording in the letters was initially polite, but because Shen did not pay attention, Ji also sent a letter to Shen threatening, "If you don't know what's good for you, you and Gu Zhuxuan will be the same, and I will bite you and make you go to court." After receiving this letter, Shen hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Special Court Criminal Division, accusing Ji Xilin of extortion and requesting legal investigation. According to the lawsuit, the court was held by Judge Zhang Minsheng in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. The plaintiff was represented by a lawyer, but the defendant in prison used the name Qian Yongchun, which was different from the name in the lawsuit, so he could not be brought to court for interrogation. The court briefly questioned the plaintiff's lawyer and ordered that the defendant's case be interrogated again on the morning of the 29th.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Company Transports Air Cargo on Behalf, Sells Airline Tickets, and Handles Insurance Business</h3>

<h3>Four Groups Preparing to Commemorate Zhang Xiaoliang; Individuals and Groups Participate in Succession; Tonghui Elementary School on the Afternoon of the 29th</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaoliang of Nanhui inherited his predecessor's business and operated the Jiuji Timber Company, and founded the Jiuji Construction Factory. For more than 30 years, he has become a giant in Shanghai's industry and commerce. Throughout his life, he promoted and supported all public welfare undertakings of the country and society, and spared no effort. Almost all institutions and groups were related to him, such as the Shui Mu Industry Office, the Trade Association, the Chinese Red Cross, the Shanghai Local Association, the Architecture Association, the Construction Society, the Women and Children Relief Association, the Jisheng Association, the Pudong Fellow Association, the Timber Industry Trade Association, etc., serving as chairman, director, board member, or chairman. Schools at all levels that have received his assistance are even more difficult to enumerate, and those who personally request assistance are always helped to succeed. Dealing with the world, handling affairs, and treating people are all done with sincerity and purity. In recent years, due to overwork, his physical condition has gradually weakened. He was expecting to take care of himself and recover, but he suddenly suffered from heart disease and died on June 1 of this year. Now, the Shanghai Construction Factory Industry Trade Association, the Construction Association, the Pudong Fellow Association, and the Timber Industry Trade Association and other four groups have initiated preparations for a memorial service. It has been decided to hold the service at Tonghui Elementary School, No. 253 Malang Road, at 2 pm on the 19th (Saturday) of this month, and to publicly solicit the participation of various groups and individuals to express their condolences. Groups that have joined after hearing the news, such as the Shanghai Local Association, the Orphanage, the Vagrant Practice Center, the Greater China Hotel, the Changde Oil Factory, the Shanghai Education Bureau, the Poor Children's Home, and Mr. Zhao Jinqing, have been very enthusiastic, and those who send elegiac couplets and banners are even more on the way. The association's preparation office is located at Room 620, 6th Floor, Nanjing Road Continental Commercial Building. Various circles can send elegiac couplets and other items, or contact the preparation office at the above location or the Pudong Fellow Association on the 9th floor of No. 274 Aiduo Road. The cost of the memorial service will be borne by the four initiating groups, and other participating groups will be charged 20 to 90 yuan at their discretion. Charitable groups will be exempted from fees. It is also heard that a special publication will be issued on the day of the memorial service to commemorate it.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Company Shanghai-Yunnan Line Reduces Round-Trip Fares</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Eurasia Aviation Company Shanghai-Yunnan line has been very smooth since its opening. The company has recently seen that there are a growing number of people in the country who are making short-distance flights, while those who are engaged in long-distance flights are still rare. In order to arouse the interest of Chinese people in making long-distance flights and traveling to the scenic spots of Yunnan Province, the round-trip fare of the Shanghai-Yunnan line has been specially reduced, and Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaoji and others have been invited to promote it. People from all walks of life who are introduced by Du, Zhang, Wang and others, or who are interested in flying to Yunnan Province, can enjoy this special discount. Kunming, Yunnan, is rich in scenic spots, with beautiful scenery, no less than Suzhou and Hangzhou. At this time when the hot summer is fading away and the golden breeze is refreshing, it is the right time to travel to the south. It is thought that people from all walks of life who are interested in making this trip will be very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Xu Wancheng Released on Bail Yesterday After Being Detained for Two and a Half Months</h3>

<h3>Dancer Pan Ayuan Complains to the Police Station, Says Chen Henry Seduces and Abandons Her, Asks to Be Sent to the Hospital for Examination to Prove It</h3>
<p>At about 10 am yesterday morning, a young woman suddenly went to the Laozha Police Station in the Public Concession to complain. She claimed to be Pan Ayuan, a native of Huzhou, 18 years old, and her family lived at No. 18 Qiuji Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession. She had an elderly father. She had studied dance at a dance school in Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road last year. After graduating this spring, she became a dancer at the Vienna and Metropolitan dance halls. At this time, a Chaozhou man named Chen Henry (currently in his thirties) pursued her, claiming that he had studied at Fudan University, and came every night, trying to entice her in every way. He also claimed that he had no wife and wanted to marry her. At that time, I believed it to be true, so I was violated. Unexpectedly, Chen Henry has no sincerity now and intends to abandon me, so I specifically ask for rescue, and I can be sent to the hospital for examination to prove that I am not lying. After getting the confession, the police station thought that if this case was true, it would be related to disrupting public morals, so the detectives were immediately sent to Renji Hospital for examination before making a decision.</p>
<h3>Yu Changqing Catches Adultery, Stabbed Twice by Adulterer, Is Friend's Wife Inviolable? Li Shigeng Escapes</h3>
<p>Yu Changqing, 37 years old, a native of Yuyao, lives at No. 6 Zhonghua Road, Zhabei, and is currently a bookkeeper in Fuhua Company. He married Chen Xiaozhen, a 20-year-old woman from Suzhou, who is slightly attractive. Because of an inextricable bond with Yu's friend Li Shigeng (24 years old), they have been having an affair for several months. After a long time, Yu found out, but he was reluctant to publicize it because of family disgrace, so he endured it. Unexpectedly, the adulterer became more and more egregious, taking the opportunity to go to Yu's house to meet with Chen, and the love affair became more and more heated. As a result, the scandal spread everywhere, and the neighborhood knew about it. Yu could no longer bear it, so he returned home to catch adultery at 6 am yesterday. He broke through the door and entered, and Li was sleeping with Xiaozhen. Just as he was about to step forward to catch them, Li took out a foreign knife and stabbed him twice in the chest, and blood gushed out. The murderer took the opportunity to escape. Yu Changqing and his wife Chen were taken to the police station by the local police and sent to the Xinzha Branch for investigation.</p>
<h3>Reporting Examination of Two Female Corpses</h3>
<p>Shen Xiaohe, the local head of the 27th Bao, 11th Tu, reported to the Local Court that a female corpse was found in the Suzhou River on Guangfu Road today. She was about 17 or 18 years old, with cropped hair, wearing a red striped short shirt, black voile pants, flesh-colored socks, embroidered shoes, and a knife wound on the left side of her neck. Please examine. Another female corpse was also found next to the pier of the West Continental Warehouse on the New Garbage Bridge, about 20 years old, wearing a light bamboo cloth short shirt, black pants, black socks, and black shoes.

<h3>Zhao Jiexiang and Ma Xuezhen Failed to Conciliate Divorce; Self-Prosecution for Biting Left Arm Not Accepted; Claiming New Love and Admonishment Resulted in Beating</h3>
<p>Zhao Jiexiang (42 years old, a native of Ningbo), who lives at No. 57 Puqing Lane, Malang Road, French Concession, and runs a wool business, met Ma Xuezhen (29 years old this year), a woman from the same hometown, in 1923. After living together, their love became stronger. Recently, their love suddenly broke down. Zhao reported to the French police that Ma had bitten his left arm. After interrogation, because the matter was a marital squabble and the injury was very minor, it was not accepted. Later, Zhao filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court Criminal Division, accusing Ma Xuezhen of injury. The court was ordered that injury to each other cannot be self-prosecuted, and the verdict of non-acceptance was given. Therefore, Zhao filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court Civil Division, requesting mediation and divorce from Ma Xuezhen. It was claimed that Ma was a prostitute and had committed adultery with Zhang Guojun, making it impossible to live together. The court accepted the lawsuit and Judge He presided over the interrogation in the Civil Fourth Court yesterday morning. Both parties went to court with their lawyers. First, the petitioner stated the previous situation, and then Ma Xuezhen stated, "When I was 16 years old, I became pregnant after being raped by Zhao. My mother found out, and because it was a fait accompli, she married me to Zhao as his wife. We have been married and living together for more than ten years. In 1932, Zhao had a new love and often went out and did not return at night. Admonishing him resulted in abuse and beatings. Later, because Zhao was unreasonable, I once took poison. After being rescued, I returned to my mother's house to recuperate. After persuasion from relatives and friends, Zhao established an agreement to reconcile. At that time, the woman was illiterate, and Zhao was willing to establish an agreement to reconcile, so of course I was happy to comply. How could I know that Zhao had ulterior motives? The accusations in the lawsuit that I was born in a brothel and had committed adultery with others are all fabricated. Recently, since April, Zhao has only given me 30 yuan for living expenses. On the 27th of this month, I asked for expenses, and without saying a word, I was pushed down. I am eight months pregnant, and Zhao actually said that it was not his and wanted to kill the baby in my belly. Zhao's intentions are sinister. His request for divorce cannot be agreed to." The court reviewed the words and decided that the mediation was unsuccessful because both parties held different views, and ordered a formal lawsuit to be filed.</p>
<h3>Ying Wenbing, a Shop Clerk at a Rice Store, Dies Tragically Under a Tram, Fatally Injured in the Head</h3>
<p>Ying Wenbing, 34 years old, a native of Yuyao, worked as a shop clerk at Shunfeng Rice Store at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Changsha Road. At about 3 pm yesterday, Ying was ordered by the store to carry rice from a rice boat next to the Suzhou River Wharf on Changsha Road. When he was carrying a bag of rice on his shoulder and was about to cross Xinzha Road, a tram No. 37 of the third route was speeding from west to east, and he was unable to avoid it, causing him to be knocked down by the tram and injured in the head. He immediately fell into a coma. The local police officer saw this and copied down the tram number as evidence to report to the police station. He immediately sent Ying Wenbing to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after due to severe head injuries. The body has been sent to the coroner's office.</p>
<h3>Seven People Steal Family Fish, Two Lives Uncertain, Touching Crabs and Catching Fish Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>Bian Fengming, 38 years old, a native of Jingjiang, works as a handyman at the Tongwen Academy on Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai. The day before yesterday afternoon, Bian invited Li Dagou, Li Jinbao (15 years old), Yang Zhou people Gu Arer and other seven people living in nearby sheds to touch crabs and catch fish in the river in front of the Zhujia house in the east of Hongqiao Town. They were spotted by local villagers Zhu Xiaodi and others (because there are family fish in the river), who accused Bian and others of stealing family fish, but Bian and others were not to be outdone, and they insulted each other, followed by fighting. The villagers were no match, so they sounded the gong to warn, and the villagers gathered together, shouting to catch the robbers. Bian and other seven people were all surrounded and beaten severely by the villagers. Later, the police station in charge heard about it and rushed to the scene, arresting Zhu Xiaodi, the culprit, on the spot, and the others fled in all directions. The injured were sent to the Red Cross on Haige Road for treatment. Among them, Li Jinbao and Bian Fengming had the most serious injuries, with bruises all over their bodies. The doctor said that there were also internal injuries, and their lives were in danger. The others were unharmed. After bandaging, they were discharged from the hospital.</p>
<h3>Shen A-si's Use of Counterfeit Coins - Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment - Yang Zhang-xian Acquitted</h3>
<p>Xie Wanfang, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, discovered that Shen A-si, a native of Huzhou, was secretly selling lead-based counterfeit two-cent coins in the market from house number 115 on Yanshan Road for circulation. He obtained a search warrant from the court and, accompanied by a Western detective, proceeded to arrest Shen on his bed the previous afternoon. Six counterfeit coins were seized. Upon interrogation, Shen confessed that he had purchased the counterfeit coins from Zhang A-, a fellow villager at house number 446 on North Shansi Road, for five copper coins each. The detectives went to the address to arrest Zhang A-, but he had already moved elsewhere. However, they found five similar counterfeit coins in the drawer of a table in his bedroom. The suspect, Yang Zhangbao, also from Huzhou, Shen, and the counterfeit coins were all taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, presented the case, stating that Shen A-si had claimed at the police station that he had bought a total of ten such counterfeit coins from the absconded Zhang A-, and had used four of them. He was charged with counterfeiting currency under Article 196, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, and requested that the court impose a severe punishment according to the law. Detective Xie then reported the details of the arrest, and the counterfeit coins were presented for inspection. Judge Xiao Bianfen interrogated the two defendants, who gave clear confessions. After hearing a defense by lawyer Ding Zheming, Shen A-si was sentenced to two years of imprisonment, and the counterfeit coins were confiscated. Yang Zhangbao was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Unmarried Couple - Frequent Lawsuits - Why Former Intimacy Turns to Resentment - The Court Still Moves with Emotion</h3>
<p>Wu Yongkang, a student at Chi Zhi University, is now being sued by his fiancée, Luo Wenmei (daughter of Luo Xueshun, former accountant of the Qing Bureau), in the local court to fulfill the marriage contract. The suit states that Wenmei is twenty years old, a local resident, living at 18 Tan Jia Qiao, Qi Mei Road. In February of the 22nd year, she became engaged to the defendant. In May of the same year, the defendant's parents repeatedly requested that she live in their home to please them. As they spent time together, love gradually developed. On the fourth day of July in the 23rd year, the defendant suddenly developed lustful intentions and raped the plaintiff. At that time, since they were already an unmarried couple, even if a physical relationship occurred, it was only a matter of time before or after the wedding. Therefore, they both tacitly agreed not to publicize the matter. As a result, she contracted a serious illness and suffered greatly. The defendant had originally planned to marry on September 24th of the 24th year, but in July, he sent the plaintiff back to her mother's home. In August, the plaintiff's foot disease flared up, and her father was immediately notified to consult a Western doctor and designate the Hongkou Sanatorium for treatment. However, the root of this disease was transmitted by the defendant, and Guangren Hospital doctors declared it to be syphilis. The plaintiff's heart is broken, her chastity ruined, and she has been infected with a terrible disease. Therefore, she requests the prosecutor to bring charges. Although the forensic examination concluded that it was not syphilis, she was greatly relieved. However, since the defendant had entered into an engagement beforehand, cohabited afterward, had a physical relationship, and set a date for the wedding, but now he not only failed to hold the wedding on time but is now advancing to dissolve the engagement, which is not only not allowed by law but also intolerable by morality. Yesterday, Judge Wang held a court hearing. Luo Wenmei, accompanied by her lawyer, Zuo De, stated in court that she was born to be a member of his family in life and a ghost of his family in death, requesting that the marriage contract be fulfilled. The defendant did not appear and was represented by lawyer Ma Shouhua, who stated that the defendant is twenty-two years old, a Shanghai native, living at 336 Jinji Road. The engagement was arranged by his parents, and the plaintiff had accused him of rape and assault at the prosecutor's office, but the charges were dismissed. On July 14th of the 23rd year, the defendant was on summer vacation and went to Qingdao with his father to escape the summer heat. How could he have committed rape? Therefore, he is unwilling to fulfill the marriage contract. The court, sensing that there was still some affection between them, ordered them to first attempt to reconcile outside of court. The case was postponed for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Liquor and Restaurant Industry Bans on Extra Tips - Objection to the Third Item</h3>
<p>A letter from the Liquor and Restaurant Industry Association to its members states that in order to ban extra tips in the New Life Movement, the association has received a notice from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send representatives to attend a meeting with relevant industry members and police agencies to discuss implementation measures. In the first meeting, Commissioner Cheng Kefan attended the New Life Movement meeting of the Municipal Party Headquarters and requested that the New Life Movement collect effective measures that have been implemented in other provinces and cities for discussion. On August 14th, Commissioner Li Mancun of the Cantonese faction and Commissioner Hu Yuantang of the Anhui faction attended the discussion. The New Life Movement revised the draft measures, which have been reported in the newspapers. However, they seem to conflict with the third principle of the New Life Movement General Association's announcement of implementation measures. On the 16th of this month, the Standing Committee discussed this and expressed support for banning extra tips. After reviewing the fourth and fifth principles of the New Life Movement General Association's announcement of implementation measures, there seem to be some doubts. Extra solicitations should be sanctioned, but whether legitimate gifts should be punished should be studied. Furthermore, the wages of employees in various factions are not consistent, and the selection of personnel is determined by both labor and management. The long-standing practice of taking extra tips from customers should be banned, and the fault lies with the individual. Member companies should not be held accountable. Several assumptions are made and listed as follows: (1) After the announcement of the ban on extra tips is implemented, customers' voluntary and legitimate gifts should not be restricted. (2) If waiters or employees solicit extra tips from customers, they will be investigated and punished, and the store will not be involved. (3) Each company should determine the punishment for taking tips based on existing good customs. The employer and employee should determine the salaries of employees and workers themselves, and it is absolutely forbidden to solicit extra tips from customers; otherwise, they will bear the consequences themselves. (4) The New Life Movement Promotion General Association's measures for banning extra tips must be accompanied by detailed rules for each industry, as each industry has its own customs and different situations. However, the association members do not have the custom of requiring security deposits, so they should not be compared with other industries. The above four items are for members to participate in and provide feedback. Members are also invited to submit their opinions for joint review and announcement. A copy of the New Life Movement General Association's announcement measures is attached. Please submit written suggestions to the association for research within three days.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Enamel Factory - Lawsuit Between Shareholders and Directors - Is There a Breach of Trust? - Both Parties State Their Claims</h3>
<p>Ye Yin-san, chairman and general manager of the Shanghai Enamel Factory, is being sued for breach of trust by shareholders Wang Guo-sheng, Wu Chen-hu, Yang Mao-zhi, Zhang Jin-kui, etc., in the local court. They state that Dahua Paper Factory, Junda Huahang, Yuanxinghang, etc., are also operated by the defendant. They read in the Shen Bao on July 3rd that there was an announcement about the auction of the Shanghai Enamel Factory's property by the above factories and firms. Disregarding the mortgage, the Shanghai Local Court approved the auction of the Shanghai Enamel Factory's factory base, buildings, production machinery, and other real estate for priority compensation. It was discovered that the defendant colluded with Dahua, etc., to deceive the court into mediation, recognizing that the Dahua, etc., which he operated, had priority compensation rights over the factory's property worth more than 100,000 yuan, and auctioned it off himself. Therefore, he violated his duties. It is requested that he be prosecuted for breach of trust under Article 342 of the Criminal Law. Judge Shao Qin-zhi held a court hearing yesterday. The defendant Ye Yin-san argued that the plaintiffs did not deny that the Shanghai Enamel Factory owed Dahua Paper Factory, Junda Huahang, and Yuanxinghang. These debts had been repeatedly reported at shareholder meetings. They only denied the Shanghai Enamel Factory's property mortgage debts out of thin air and slandered him. According to the elements of breach of trust, first, there must be an intention to illegally benefit oneself or a third party or to harm the interests of the principal. Second, there must be an act that violates his duties. Third, the principal's property or other interests must be harmed as a result. In this case, where are the above three acts? The Shanghai Enamel Factory has long been closed, and the debts owed to Dahua, etc., have not been repaid. Shareholder meetings have been convened, but no solution has been found, leading to litigation and an order to pay off the debts within half a month, otherwise the property will be auctioned off. Later, the defendant asked the creditors to publish notices in the newspapers on July 13th and 20th, extending the deadline by one month, first allowing the shareholders to buy the property at the price of 78,300 yuan, as estimated by Mr. Zhou Bingrong. If they did not buy it, then Dahua, etc., would auction it off according to the law. If the plaintiffs truly cared about the factory, they could have quickly repaid the debts and stopped the auction. Moreover, the deficit is very large, and even if it is not based on the mortgage loan account books, it is still not permissible. They only enjoy rights and do not fulfill their debt repayment obligations. There is no reason to accuse him of breach of trust and expose their own ugliness. He also submitted thirteen account books and a shareholder roster as evidence and attacked the plaintiffs as being minority shareholders who are using criminal charges for other purposes. After reviewing the statements of both parties, the judge stated that both parties had presented their arguments and adjourned the hearing to review the evidence again.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Military Band Director - Sayer's First Performance</h3>
<p>Today (Sunday) at 4:30 pm, there will be a military band performance in the Zhaofeng Garden in West Shanghai. This performance is slightly different from usual, because Mr. W.W. Sayer, the newly appointed director of the Shanghai Municipal Council Brass Band, will make his first official appearance before the music-loving public of Shanghai today. Mr. Sayer is British and graduated from the Royal Military School of Music in the United Kingdom. The school has produced many talented people. Graduates of the school hold important positions in the British military band. Mr. Sayer previously held important positions. After the European War, the British Royal Military Band was reorganized, and Mr. Sayer made great contributions to the planning. Therefore, he was highly appreciated by King George V. Recently, he was reappointed as the captain of the British Royal Broadcasting Military Band. He has a wealth of experience in the organization of the military band. Since arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Sayer has first been engaged in the transformation of the band. He feels that it is necessary to change the direction of the arrangement of the program after this. According to what Mr. Sayer has told people, the first principle of music is to make people happy when they hear it. Shanghai is a gathering place for merchants. After a long day of hard work in the office, the best mental adjustment is to walk in the park and listen to a song quietly, which can eliminate people's troubles and make them feel happy and refreshed. Therefore, Mr. Sayer will give priority to light-quality tunes in the program of military band performances in the future, and he will also adopt the dance music popular in Europe and the United States at the moment, which can inspire the spirit. As for the profound tunes of the elegant school, one or two pieces are enough each time, and more will make people feel bored. Mr. Sayer's views on music are like this, which is indeed refreshing. Those who listen to today's elegant performance can get a glimpse of it.</p>

<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, the Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory at 1188 Zhoujiazui Road, Dalian Road, East Shanghai, has 118 workers. It has been open for more than two years.

When the old workers heard the news, they were panicked. They had negotiated with the factory to no avail, and specially elected representatives Shen Qinbo, Gao Afu, Zhang Jiquan, etc., to submit a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning, requesting relief. Zhang Chuqiang, a clerk of the Third Section, received them. The workers made three requests: (1) All original workers should be hired to work and no new workers should be recruited. (2) Otherwise, each person must be paid a dismissal fee of three months. (3) Return the public bond money of each worker. Clerk Zhang said that he would schedule a mediation between the two parties to resolve the matter. He hoped that the workers would wait patiently for a solution.</p>

<h3>The Tiandetang Abortion Case Yesterday's Autopsy of Abortion Corpse, Xi Xiaoquan Explained the Process, Chen Zhou's Family Claimed the Body</h3>
<p>Chen Rui, a native of Ningbo (erroneously reported as Chen Zhi in yesterday's newspaper), 37 years old, currently working as a coach in a certain agency in the capital, married Zhou, 21 years old, the daughter of Zhou Renmao, 41 years old, a businessman residing at 322 Rue Bourgeat in the French Concession, last year. Chen works in Beijing, while Zhou lives with her mother's family in Shanghai and has received considerable education. She is currently studying to be an obstetrician at the Ximen Obstetrics Hospital. Chen travels between Beijing and Shanghai from time to time. Six months ago, Zhou gave birth to a son. Recently, she became pregnant again for over three months. Suddenly, on the 14th of this month, she went to the Beiping Tiandetang Venereal and Obstetrics Hospital at 306 Avenue Joffre and requested an abortion. The medical fee was agreed upon at 16 yuan, paid in full at once. Later, male doctor Xi Dian and female doctor Xi Xiaoquan administered medication for her to swallow. On the 15th and 16th, she went for surgery four times, successfully aborting the fetus. However, the placenta remained inside her abdomen. Zhou then returned to her mother's home to recuperate. It was discovered that the placenta remained in her abdomen, causing it to fester and bleed incessantly. On the afternoon of the 20th, at 3 pm, Zhou's mother, Zhou Li, sent Zhou to the Guangren Hospital on Avenue Edward VII (erroneously reported as Guangci Hospital in yesterday's newspaper) for treatment. The hospital, upon learning that the illness was caused by an abortion, reported it to the Xinzha Police Station as per regulations, which then notified the French Police Station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest the female doctor Xi Xiaoquan of Tiandetang and escort her to the Second Special Court for questioning and detention, rescheduling the hearing for the 25th. Xi Dian fled upon hearing the news. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. Chen Zhou died in Guangren Hospital at 9:30 pm on the 21st due to excessive abdominal festering and ineffective treatment. The hospital notified the French Police Station to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for autopsy. Yesterday, they reported to Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, who, accompanied by forensic doctors, arrived at the morgue for examination. The police sent Xi Xiaoquan to court. According to the interrogation, the deceased came to request an abortion, which was accepted by her husband Xi Dian, who also performed the surgery. Xi Xiaoquan herself was not consulted. The official ruled that Chen Zhou had indeed died from an abortion. The body was claimed by her father, Zhou Renmao, for burial. The defendant Xi Xiaoquan was taken back by the police for continued detention. Yuan Hesong, Zhu Yuquan, Hu Kaitong, etc., are scheduled to come to Zhen on the 25th of this month to plead for relief in person. This is a preliminary telegram. Respectfully, Xu Xiaochu, Chairman of the National Federation of New Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, and Xu Xiangsun, Chairman of the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, respectfully kowtow.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Football Team Arrives in Paris to Compete with the Strong "Red Star" Team of Paris</h3>
<p>Paris, August 22 (Havas) The Chinese football team participating in the Olympic Games has now arrived here and is scheduled to hold a competition with the strong "Olympique Red Star Team" of Paris at the Saint-Ouen football field in the suburbs this afternoon. The Chinese team just defeated the famous "Servette" team in Geneva by a score of 3 to 2 the day before yesterday, so its strength can be seen. The "Red Star" team will fight with its strongest lineup, so the situation of today's competition is very noteworthy. Various newspapers have stated that the Chinese team's performance is excellent. It is difficult to predict who will win or lose the competition today. Among them, "L'Auto" (one of the sports newspapers) stated that the members of the Chinese team are in good health and full of perseverance. A determination to win is visible between their eyebrows. The Red Star team should proceed with caution and respond accordingly.</p>
<h3>A Reporter's Account of the World Games Athlete Delegation (Letter No. 9)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen from the Central News Agency</p>
<p>(4) (7) The Second Day of the Games</p>
<p>August 2nd was the second day of the Games, and also the first day of various competitions. The events held included the modern pentathlon at 9:00 AM, track and field events starting at 10:30 AM, the 100-meter preliminary round, high jump preliminary round, shot put preliminary round, wrestling at 11:00 AM, and starting at 3:00 PM, the track and field high jump final, 100-meter final, women's javelin final, 800-meter preliminary round, shot put final, 10,000-meter final, fencing, field hockey, wrestling, and starting at 8:00 PM, the weightlifting final (lightweight and featherweight), fencing. All the stands were overflowing with people. When the competition reached a critical moment, cheers erupted, and the enthusiasm was extremely high.</p>
<p>German Führer Adolf Hitler, accompanied by General Göring and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, arrived at the track and field venue at 3:30 PM amidst a warm welcome from the entire stadium. He sat in the command platform, observing in detail through binoculars, his face full of smiles, showing great interest. In the women's javelin final, German athletes won first, second, and sixth place. After the awards ceremony, they, along with the Polish athlete who won third place, walked onto the command platform to pay their respects. Hitler stepped forward to shake hands with each of them, expressing deep encouragement, and took a photo with the two German athletes supporting him on either side. The entire stadium responded to this interesting scene with enthusiastic cheers. Hitler didn't leave until 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>There were so many events held today that the reporter couldn't be in multiple places at once. I can only describe the situation at the track and field venue in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Equipment at the Track and Field Venue</p>
<p>The general situation of the Games venue has already been described in the previous section. Now, I will briefly describe what is worth reporting during the competition: (1) There are no idlers in the arena except for referees and a very small number of necessary staff. Even the athletes only enter the arena in a queue from the west gate when the competition is about to begin and leave immediately after the competition is over, so the order is extremely good. (2) The finish line judges sit on trapezoidal chairs on both sides of the track, paying attention to the ranking and the time at the same time, and also using cameras to take pictures, so there is absolutely no chance of disputes over the ranking. The referees all wear uniform uniforms, and their appearance is also very neat. (3) The gun used by the starter and the watches used by the timers are connected by electricity, so the timing is extremely accurate and there is absolutely no error. (4) After each race, the track is rolled with a machine, and the white lines of the track are also drawn with a small machine. If the route is a bit unclear, it is quickly redrawn. (5) A movie camera is installed in the arena, and all the competitions are filmed. They can be shown in the New Village on the third night. (6) During each competition, the progress is reported in detail by radio, so the audience can fully understand everything. After the final is over, the results are also reported by radio, and posted on the announcement board, but only the top three are reported, which is a pity. (7) After the top three winners of the final are announced, they all stand on the winner's platform in the arena, and a woman in uniform places a wreath made of leaves on each person's head. The first-place winner also receives a tree branch. At the same time, the national flags of the three countries are raised on the platform of the east grandstand, and the band plays the national anthem of the first-place athlete's country. This supreme honor is truly admirable and enviable, but this kind of glory is not easy to come by.</p>
<p>100-Meter Preliminary Round</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, the track and field program began with the 100-meter preliminary round, which was divided into twelve groups. Each group had either five or six athletes, and the top two from each group were selected to participate in the final. The most noticed by the entire stadium were of course the two American black athletes, Owens and Metcalfe (another American black sprinter, Peacock, did not come to Germany due to a leg injury). When it was their turn to run, the whole stadium cheered enthusiastically. Owens lived up to expectations, breaking the world record with a time of 10.3 seconds, leaving the second-place Sasaki of his group about seven or eight meters behind. Owens' stride was very relaxed, and it looked like he wasn't using much effort, but his legs moved extraordinarily quickly, and his arm movements were also very powerful, his posture was very beautiful. Metcalfe obviously didn't use his full strength, perhaps because it was a preliminary round. He won by about a shoulder length over the second place, and the time was the same at 10.8 seconds. Another American veteran sprinter, Wykolf, won by about one meter over the first place, with a time of 10.6 seconds. The best time among the other groups was by Dutch athlete Oosendard, with a time of 10.5 seconds. The Chinese athletes who participated were Fu Jincheng, Cheng Jinguan, and Liu Changchun. Fu was in the fifth group, with a total of five people. Fu's start was slow, and he fell behind from the beginning. By the time he reached the finish line, he was five or six meters behind the first place. The times of the first and second place in this group were both 10.8 seconds, and the third place was 11 seconds. Fu's time must have been between 11.1 and 11.3 seconds. I don't know why he regressed so much. Cheng Jinguan was in the eighth group, also with five people. After the start, he was six or seven meters behind the first place and one step behind the third place to get the fourth, but the third place’s result was 11 seconds something, and Cheng's result was also much worse than when he was in China. Liu Changchun was in the eleventh group, also with five people. Liu occupied the innermost lane and started extremely quickly. He was still in second place at 30 meters, but then he was overtaken. He was a step behind the third place when he reached the finish line. The time of the first place in this group was 10.7 seconds, and the second and third places were both 10.8 seconds. Liu's time was about 11 seconds. The results of each group are as follows:</p>

<p>Sasaki (Japan) 11 seconds</p>
<p>100-Meter Semi-Final</p>
<p>When the 100-meter semi-final was held at 3:00 PM, it was drizzling lightly and the weather was quite chilly, like the weather in China at the end of October. The competition was divided into four groups, each with six people, and the top three from each group were selected, for a total of twelve people. In the first group, American star Wykoff had a slow start. Although he tried his best to sprint in the middle, he still finished third by a shoulder length. In the second group, Owens used his swift legs and worked even harder than in the preliminary round, achieving a time of 10.2 seconds, setting a new world record. The entire stadium cheered after hearing the report. The first place was five or six meters behind, and Japanese sprinter Yoshioka Ryuto finished fourth and was also eliminated. In the third group, Metcalf was still behind everyone at 50 meters, but he broke free at 70 meters, sped forward, and reached the finish line first in 10.5 seconds. In the fourth group, the only German athlete jumped to the front from third place at 60 meters, leaving the second place 1 meter behind when he reached the finish line. The audience in the stadium cheered wildly, even more enthusiastically than for Owens. The winners of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>Strandberg (Sweden) 10.5 seconds</p>
<p>Oosendard (Netherlands) 10.6 seconds</p>
<p>Wykoff (USA) 10.6 seconds</p>

<p>Swin (England) 10.6 seconds</p>
<p>Ivey (Canada) 10.7 seconds</p>
<p>800-Meter Preliminary Round</p>
<p>The 800-meter preliminary round was held at 4:00 PM, divided into six groups with nine participants each, and the top four were selected. The black athletes once again stole the show. In the first group, Canadian black athlete Edwards ran very leisurely and led the whole way. American athlete Hornbostel, although he competed hard, still finished second by a shoulder length. Chinese athlete Shan Lianren participated in the third group. He was able to fight hard in the first lap, ranking fourth, but his strength waned in the second lap and he gradually fell behind, 60 meters behind the first place. His strength was not as good, it was not his fault. The competition strength in the other groups was very even, and it is expected that there will be fierce competition in the semi-finals and finals.</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>Edwards (Canada) 1 minute 53.7 seconds</p>
<p>Hornbostel (USA) 1 minute 53.7 seconds</p>

<p>Saurial (France) 1 minute 56.1 seconds</p>
<p>10,000-Meter Final</p>
<p>The 10,000-meter final was held at 5:30 PM. Although Finnish long-distance runners swept the top three spots, Japanese athlete Murakoshi fought fiercely with them, creating a magnificent bloody battle, which also won the enthusiastic sympathy of the entire stadium. A total of 29 athletes participated in the final, starting in two rows. Murakoshi was in the inner circle of the first row, taking a great advantage. He was in the front from the start. Fifty-eight swift legs formed a long snake formation, moving forward step by step, one after another. At the time, the Finnish athletes were mixed in the crowd, not revealing themselves at all. By the end of the fifth lap, Murakoshi had left the last Indian athlete one lap behind. At the same time, Finn Sami Neni had slowly caught up from behind, and England's Pence and Eden were also closely following. By the end of the ninth lap, the three Finnish athletes had crowded together and were closely following behind Murakoshi. By the thirteenth lap, they strode forward, surpassing Murakoshi, with Asgura leading the way, and the other athletes getting farther and farther apart. From the eighteenth lap to the twentieth lap, Murakoshi and the three Finnish athletes competed more fiercely, sometimes moving forward, sometimes retreating, similar to the scene when Wang Zhenglin fought with the Shanxi general at the Chinese National Games. In the tenth lap, Murakoshi once again took the lead, but it was fleeting and he was eventually overtaken by the Finnish athletes. In the last lap, the two Finnish runners opened their strides and sprinted hard. Sami Neni and Asgura competed even more fiercely, advancing side by side, neither giving way. At the finish line, Sami Neni won the top spot by a step, with Iso Haro finishing third by two meters. Murakoshi finished fourth, ten meters behind. The British and American athletes finished fifth and sixth, more than 300 meters apart. Chinese athlete Wang Zhenglin did not participate.</p>
<p>(1) Sami Neni (Finland) 30 minutes 15.4 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Asgura (Finland) 30 minutes 15.6 seconds</p>
<p>(3) Iso Haro (Finland) 30 minutes 20.6 seconds</p>
<p>(4) Murakoshi (Japan)</p>
<p>(5) Pence (England)</p>
<p>(6) Rush (USA)</p>
<p>High Jump Final</p>
<p>A total of 50 athletes from various countries participated in the high jump. The preliminary round was held in two groups at 10:30 AM, starting at 1.70 meters. It was stipulated that they had to jump over 1.85 meters to participate in the final in the afternoon. Chinese athlete Wu Biqing participated in the second group. He was alone and his spirit was slightly affected. When the bar was raised to 1.75 meters and 1.80 meters, Wu jumped over both heights in one attempt. But at 1.85 meters, he failed to clear the bar in two attempts (each person only had two attempts), so he was eliminated and did not qualify to participate in the final. The final in the afternoon was participated in by 24 people, starting at 1.75 meters. Only 11 people cleared 1.90 meters. At 1.94 meters, Germany's Gehmert and Kusse both failed to clear the bar and were eliminated. At 1.97 meters, Japan's Tanaka and Finland's Kaima also failed to clear the bar and were eliminated. When the bar was raised to 2 meters, Johnson and Albritton from the United States (both black athletes), Thurber, and Finland's Kotkas cleared it. Only Johnson cleared 2.03 meters. When the bar was raised again to 1.08 meters, he failed to clear it in three attempts and failed to break the world record of 2.06 meters held by Marty (USA). The competition for second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth place did not end until 7:00 PM. The results of the top four all broke the Games record of 1.98 meters held by American Osborn.</p>
<p>(1) Johnson (USA) 2.03 meters</p>
<p>(2) Albritton (USA) 2 meters</p>
<p>(3) Thurber (USA) 2 meters</p>
<p>(4) Kotkas (Finland) 2 meters</p>
<p>(5) Yada (Japan) 1.97 meters</p>
<p>(6) Kaima (Finland) 1.94 meters</p>
<p>Shot Put Final</p>
<p>The shot put preliminary round was held at 11:00 AM. A total of 38 people participated, divided into two groups. It was stipulated that they had to throw over 14 meters to qualify for the official preliminary round. White lines were drawn in the arena to mark the distances of 14, 15, 16, and 17 meters, and small flags marked the Games record and the world record, which was very clear. Chinese athlete Chen Baoqiu participated in the second group. All three of his throws were far short of the 14-meter white line, so he was eliminated. The official preliminary round was held at 5:30 PM, selecting six people. Polish athlete Barlund ranked first with 16.03 meters, and German athlete Woelke was second with 15.96 meters. Each person had three throws in the final. During his second throw, Woelke exerted his strength and achieved a score of 16.20 meters, winning the top spot. The entire stadium cheered. Barlund advanced to 16.12 meters in his third throw, but he still finished second by a difference of 0.08 meters. The results of the top two both broke the Games record of 16 meters held by Sarton (USA). American Torrance, who holds the world record of 17.40 meters, was not successful. He only achieved 15.38 meters in the preliminary round. He was listless in the three throws of the final, and only finished fifth, more than two meters away from his personal best record.</p>
<p>(1) Woelke (Germany) 16.20 meters</p>
<p>(2) Barlund (Poland) 16.12 meters</p>
<p>(3) Stock (Germany) 15.66 meters</p>
<p>(4) Francis (USA) 15.45 meters</p>
<p>(5) Torrance (USA) 15.48 meters</p>
<p>(6) Chase (USA) 15.32 meters</p>
<p>Women's Javelin Final</p>
<p>The women's javelin final was held at 3:00 PM and was the first final event to be announced that day. German female athletes swept the first, second, and third places, so that the German flag was first raised on the announcement platform flagpole, no wonder the German audience cheered wildly. German Führer Hitler personally met with the three German athletes on the command platform after the award ceremony, and also encouraged the Polish athlete who won third place. German athlete Fleiscker was tall and threw well, achieving an excellent record of 45.18 meters in the second throw of the final, breaking the Games record of 43.69 meters held by American Ms. Didrikson, but compared with the world record of 46.74 meters held by American Ms. Gindele, it was still more than one meter short. The scores of the other athletes were all above 41 meters, which can be called commendable.</p>
<p>(1) Fleiscker (Germany) 43.18 meters</p>
<p>(2) Kroger (Germany) 43.29 meters</p>
<p>(3) Wasniska (Poland) 41.80 meters</p>

<h3>National Higher Education Trends and Number of Graduates Over the Years</h3>
<p>According to statistics from the Ministry of Education on national higher education, before the founding of the Republic of China, there were more than 3,000 graduates from universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools. In the first two years of the Republic of China, the annual number of graduates was only 400 to 900. From the third to the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the annual number was over 1,000. From the twelfth to the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the annual number ranged from 2,000 to 4,000. By the 20th year of the Republic of China, it had increased to more than 7,000. In the last three years, it has further increased to 8,000 to 9,000. Because the annual number of graduates is increasing, but the avenues of employment cannot meet the corresponding demand, unemployment is inevitable. According to recent surveys and statistics for the three years of the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th years, there were a total of 26,959 graduates from vocational schools and above in the country (18,671 in the four categories of arts, law, education, and commerce, and 8,288 in the four categories of science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine). Among them, the unemployed accounted for about 13% of the total. And this 13% is mostly graduates from the arts and law departments, with very few educators and business people, and most science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine graduates have found employment. The Ministry of Education is fundamentally addressing the root causes of this problem. In addition to restricting the enrollment of arts and law departments, it is also revising the curriculum and equipment standards of vocational schools and above, sending personnel to inspect and supervise their implementation, cracking down on substandard private vocational schools and above, and formulating scholarship measures. It is taking both active and passive measures to ensure that learning is practical and can be applied after graduation. As a temporary solution, the Executive Yuan has opened vocational training classes for graduates of vocational schools and above. The first phase will enroll 1,000 students, and classes are scheduled to begin on October 1st. The National Academic Work Consulting Office is currently collecting and organizing the documents of the students being recommended. This is an unprecedented move to help graduates of vocational schools and above. In the future, both long-term and short-term measures will be implemented, and the avenues of employment for university graduates will naturally become less difficult. Here are the total numbers of graduates from national higher education over the years: a total of 52,202 university graduates, 19,931 college graduates, and 9,470 vocational school graduates. The total number of graduates from vocational schools and above is 81,613.</p>

<h3>Securities: Weaknesses in the 96 Bonds Gradually Revealed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange once rose before trending towards peace. Although only one or two days remained for settlement, the situation was extremely firm and stable. Although the number of long and short positions was significant, the majority had already been settled outside the exchange, so there were only a few swap transactions on the exchange. The weaknesses in the 96 bonds were gradually revealed, but long positions were still being maintained. Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, those who blindly sold short in the overnight trading compensated, as the environment was not conducive to selling. The market price rose by 0.2 to 0.55 yuan. Afterwards, the market became chaotic, fluctuating up and down, unevenly floating around 5.1 yuan.

The results of the price fluctuations are compared and listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Sales of Marked Yarn Shift to the Majority</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak and trending downward, due to the poor conditions of overseas yarn and cotton, coupled with the domestic cotton harvest, falling cotton prices, and easing cotton yarn costs. The market price is difficult to rise, and speculators are selling heavily, so the market is still in distress. However, sales of current yarn are still able to maintain.</p>
<p>Many Long Positions in Marked Yarn Liquidated</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened this morning with near-term contracts continuing to decline, but the situation showed signs of stabilization. Far-term contracts were unchanged. After the second round, the price fluctuation of each month was 0.3 to 0.4 jiao, and the market was uneven. Because Genfeng purchased in large quantities, the amount was very large. Dafu and Ruidai also compensated for their short positions. However, Changfeng, Mingde, Dachang, and Runkang simultaneously liquidated their long positions, which did not have a significant impact on the market. However, Osaka Sampin fell sharply by 1.8 to 2 yuan. As a result, the rise and fall of each month compared to the previous day's closing price was 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 jiao. After the market opened in the afternoon, the market situation turned higher. Some short positions were compensated, and the market was firm. As the market closed, the long positions liquidated again, and the market suddenly relaxed and fell sharply. As a result, each month fell by 0.3, 0.4, 0.8, and 0.9 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Tongji sold 800 bales, Hengyi sold 1750 bales, Jin sold 1300 bales, Mingde sold 1750 bales, Taichang sold 1150 bales, Changfeng sold 4150 bales, Runkang sold 3200 bales, Dachang sold 2400 bales, Dafeng sold 1000 bales, Yudai sold 750 bales, and Jinkang sold 750 bales.

<p>Henan 25</p>
<h3>New Cotton From Various Regions Gradually Enters the Market; Sharp Decline in Marked Cotton Continues; First Batch of 140 Bales of New Yao Cotton Arrives</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat and weak, and the situation is increasingly deteriorating, due to the abundant domestic cotton harvest, and the gradual entry of new cotton from various regions into the market, which has weakened confidence. The first batch of 140 bales of new Yao cotton from Ningbo has arrived, for delivery in August. Therefore, no price has been quoted at the dock. It is said that the color and quality are very good.</p>
<p>New Cotton Declines More Sharply</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened this morning, with US cotton falling 11 to 12 points due to selling in the South, Indian cotton suspended, and Osaka Sampin cotton falling 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. Market sentiment was mixed, but some bought on dips, with near-term contracts rising slightly by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. As for far-term contracts, the long positions were unloading, and the market tended to loosen. After the first round, the August old cotton still had no significant solution, and the situation was particularly weak. The far-term contracts were mostly waiting and seeing, because of the sharp decline yesterday. The situation was stagnant. Genfeng bought in large quantities, while Hengyi and Yongyu sold short, increasing their short positions. As a result, August fell by 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the far-term contracts rose and fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. After the market opened in the afternoon, the near-term market was mediocre, and the far-term market brought the prices. After the second round, the near-term was still flat.

<h3>Increased Number of Wooden Frame Sheds—Survey on August 19th—</h3>
<h3>Reaction After US Cotton Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool, with the West continuing to experience drought, and expectations of reduced cotton production. The price of each month rose by 2 to 5 points. Then, the Liverpool traders sold, and the cotton farmers sold, and long positions liquidated, and a reaction occurred. However, Japanese traders bought at limit prices, and prices rose again. Judging from the market situation, it was quite stagnant. Before the foreign development and increased selling, the industry will temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The current market requires calm. The spot market is still firm. Textiles are firm and stagnant. Heth estimates that factory use for this week will be 216,000 bales. Liverpool's inventory is 253,000 bales. At the close of the market, the stock market was weak, and the public sold, falling again. Spot prices fell by 11 points, and futures prices fell by 11 to 12 points. UK spot cotton rose by 9 points, and futures rose by 78 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 21st).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 22nd was that the July-August White Ross would be 222 rupees, down 1 rupee, the April-May White Ross would be 208.5 rupees, down 0.75 rupees, and the December-January Omra would be 190 rupees, unchanged.</p>

<h3>Statistics on Shanghai Commodity Price Index for July of the 25th Year</h3>
<p>According to the report from the National Tariff Commission, compared with last month, the wholesale, export, import commodity price indexes and living expenses index of Shanghai in July of the 25th year have all risen, with the export index rising the most. The increase rate of the other three indexes did not exceed one percent. The export index has been below 100 since January of the 21st year of the Republic of China, and once reached a low of 68.2 in April of the 23rd year. It has gradually rebounded in recent years, and has been rising since the implementation of the legal tender. This month, it reached 100.7. The main reason for this is the rebound in agricultural product prices. In recent years, the agricultural product index has risen from a low of 66.3 (April of the 23rd year) to 115.9 this month. The increase in the export index this month is still due to this reason. Although the harvest of miscellaneous grains such as wheat and beans is generally abundant, and rice and cotton are also expected to have a good harvest, the prices of wheat, beans, sesame, rapeseed, cottonseed, and cotton have increased sharply because of the high overseas market conditions and large-scale purchases by foreign merchants. As a result, the agricultural product index suddenly increased by 7.6 percent, and the total export index rose accordingly. This is not only more favorable to the commodity exchange conditions of our country's foreign trade, but also helps the rural economy, which is unable to keep up. As for the wholesale prices of other cities, the fluctuations have been stable in recent months. However, the price in Guangzhou has suddenly risen sharply. The index in May was 102.27, and it suddenly rose to 110.49 in June, an increase of about 8 percent. Since the outbreak of the Guangdong-Guangxi issue, the average exchange rate of Guangzhou Haoyang notes from 1,000 yuan to national currency in Shanghai was 707.1 yuan in May, and only 605.7 yuan in June. The value of Haoyang notes has fallen by 14 percent. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Market Also Affected Amidst News of Abundant New Cotton Harvest</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, due to repeated news of a good new cotton harvest, the yarn market was the first to be pressured, with prices falling sharply. As cotton cloth is closely related, it also showed a decline, though the trend was still moderate. The selling price of Eastern white cloth was about one dime lower per piece compared to Monday, and dyed cloth also fell by nearly one dime. However, the seasonal finished printed and dyed goods, such as straight tribute cloth, serge, woolen cloth, satin, and figured velvet, maintained stable market conditions because customer orders still required time for delivery, and new transactions were more robust than those for white cloth. Yesterday, Eastern fine cloth, fine twill, market cloth, and "84" cloth fell by an additional 2.5 cents per piece or more. The sixteen-pound coarse cloth from local factories, brands such as "Hongfu" and "Bao Xing," fell by 5 cents per piece. Local fine cloth lacked inventory, and prices remained flat. Fine twill was greatly affected by the Southwest region, and its popularity declined significantly, with no large-scale purchases from Guangdong and Hunan. However, the trend of Ningbo and Shaoxing merchants from Zhejiang Road increased gradually in recent days. The sales of light-weight coarse cloth from Ewo Factory gradually expanded, with selling prices remaining unchanged. Purchases from the Northern route, such as Tianjin and Yantai, remained strong. Yesterday, over a hundred pieces of sixteen-pound coarse cloth and other goods from factories like Shenxin and Xinyu were purchased. Hengfeng, Guangzhong, Luen Chang, printed serge, straight tribute cloth, printed velvet, and satin were also purchased by merchants from Jiangxi and local businesses.</p>
<h3>Autumn and Winter Woolen Fabrics Rise in Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric market remained good, with transactions still active. The market trend for all autumn and winter goods was excellent, with rapid sales and rising prices. Because of the lack of new arrivals in Shanghai, most people remained firm on prices. Stable exchange rates and customs duties increased costs. Recent telegrams from foreign machinery factories indicated that wool prices had also risen, leading to continuous price increases for all autumn and winter goods in the Shanghai market, with lower-end goods experiencing the most significant price increases.</p>
<h3>Grains - Imported Wheat Reports Small - Forward Wheat Supply Exceeds Demand - Resulting in a Decrease of Four or Five Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw some recovery of the current month's contracts at the start of trading due to the tight spot market situation. The near-term situation was still good. However, small reports of imported wheat from Canada and Liverpool led to a gradual decline in enthusiasm among the general public due to the ordinary conditions abroad. As a result, forward transactions had an oversupply. Initial buying and selling activity was lively, but the strength was evenly matched, leading to a flat and sluggish market. By the close of trading, the current month's contracts saw strong selling, and both near-term and long-term trends showed a downward tendency. Compared to the previous day, August and November each fell by 2 cents, September by 4 cents, October by 1 cent, and December and January each by 5 cents. The spot wheat market stabilized, and factory demand remained strong. Demand for high-grade customs wheat was very good, while medium-grade and lower-grade wheat were gradually being screened out. Yingzhou cart wheat still opened at 5.15 yuan. Yaowan, Yanghe, Bengbu, and Wuhe regular wheat was priced at 4.20 yuan. The total market volume was 22,000 bags, with 7,000 bags newly arrived, including 5,000 bags from Fu…</p>
<h3>Spot Sales Still Lack Improvement - Flour Still Shows No Signs of Recovery in Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market continued to show a flat and sluggish trend at the opening. News from imported wheat reported gains of about one dime in Chicago, small gains of two or three dimes in Canada, and a strong decline of one pence in Liverpool. As a result, floating orders successively withdrew, and the current month's contracts fell by a bit over one cent. However, raw material prices remained stable, and foreign firms gradually made purchases, attracting outside investment. Forward transactions saw inquiries from囤户 (speculators), but factories slightly recovered the current month's contracts, while forward contracts were sold to meet near-term trading needs. Therefore, trading beyond the second round was flat, but spot sales temporarily lacked activity, resulting in a mediocre overall market. Compared to the previous day's closing prices, August and December each fell by half a cent, September by 2.5 li (厘), and October and November by 7.5 li. The Flour Exchange, due to the recent cooler weather, will resume both morning and afternoon trading sessions from next week, returning to the regular schedule.</p>
<h3>New Brown Rice Arrives and Sales Are Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 客秈 (Kexian rice) and 客化 (Kehua rice) were quite active, with strong demand from local businesses, especially for new brown rice. In addition to continued strong purchases from Guangdong merchants, local demand was also robust. Total market transactions for brown rice exceeded 6,000 bags, entirely purchased by Guangdong and local merchants. Other grades of milled rice were less active than brown rice. Sellers originally intended to raise prices, but due to the strong arrivals, it was difficult to raise prices, so market prices remained similar to the previous market. The total market offerings included 1,073 bags of Saixi rice, 2,350 bags of Xiang rice, 970 bags of Wentai rice, and 5,500 bags of Han brown rice. In addition to Guangdong and local merchants, other sales were scattered.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the total arrivals from various regions only reached from the 12th and 13th, totaling 1,400 to 1,500 dan (石). Local sales were average, with only 400 bags purchased by Dalian and Qingdao merchants. Therefore, the market stabilized, with prices for both Bo Dao (薄稻) and Hou Geng (厚粳) remaining unchanged. Du Yang Jian (杜洋尖) and Yin Bian Yuan (阴变元) also showed no significant fluctuations. Over 1,000 dan of Dongxin rice arrived, and prices remained stable.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 24 or 25 boats arrived from various routes downriver. The famous goods on the market, such as Yun Wei Bai Geng (云胃白粳), Yang Du Bu Xian (羊杜埠秈), and Dongxin Geng (东新粳), were stagnant, while Bian Yuan (变元) and new Ke Jian Shang Hua (客尖尙化) were average. Bo Dao (薄稻) was flat. Market prices for high-grade Bai Geng (白粳) were stable, while medium-grade and lower-grade were firm. Prices for Yang Du Bu (羊杜埠), Ke Jian (客尖), and Dongxin Geng (东新粳) were stable. The price of Bian Yuan (变元) increased by a few cents, nearing a dime.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods - Glutinous Rice Branches Rise by Twelve Yuan - Golden Vegetable Melon Seeds Also Rebound</h3>
<p>Glutinous Rice Branches - Due to a shortage of arrivals, sellers raised prices yesterday. High-quality goods in boxes and packages opened at 112 yuan, an increase of 12 yuan. Jinshan Yuanzhi also increased artificially by 4 or 5 yuan, with ordinary goods nearing 30 yuan. However, there were still a significant number of Yuanzhi available, and if buyers remained resistant to high prices, the market might soften later. Bianzhi was more stable, only rising by about one yuan. Lanzhuzhi's asking price increased by two yuan, but there were rumors that the source of subsequent shipments might increase, making it unlikely to rise excessively.</p>
<p>Golden Needle Vegetable - After falling back by one or two yuan, sales have been slightly active in recent days, with some purchases from Guangdong merchants. Therefore, asking prices remain firm. Daxing vegetable opened at 1.5 yuan, an increase of about one yuan. It is said that merchants are not willing to sell much because the goods are mostly dry and can be held for a long time.</p>
<p>New Black Melon Seeds - Xu Kui seeds had reached a high of 17.5 yuan and a low of only 13 yuan. Now, with arrivals gradually becoming scarce, sellers are unwilling to sell cheaply and are holding firm. Therefore, the trend has shifted, and Xu Kui seeds are now opening at 14 yuan, with other small and medium-sized goods also becoming tight.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Yokohama Silk Prices Plunge by More Than Twenty Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the New York silk market, standard silk fell by 4 cents for both near-term and forward contracts. Japanese silk 83 and 75 evenness each fell by 2 cents. Shanghai silk remained unchanged, Guangdong silk fell by 1 cent, Yokohama spot goods fell by 25 yuan, and futures fell by 27 yuan, making the export of silk from Jinbu increasingly sluggish. In addition to white factories, foreign firm factories and thread silk saw continued transactions yesterday, and sellers appeared eager, so prices also rose slightly. Users only purchased Shandong yellow warp and other silks in small quantities, and the market atmosphere was also sluggish.</p>
<h3>First Half of August Raw Silk Export Statistics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's raw silk export statistics for the first half of August totaled 1,649 bales, and waste silk exports totaled 1,460 bales, for a total of 3,109 bales. The breakdown of export categories is listed below:</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<h3>Green Tea Transactions Busiest on Weekends</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Machinery Industry Association yesterday, the green tea market this week was more active than last week, especially with brisk sales over the past two days. Chou Zhen (抽珍) was the most popular, with Xiehe importing about 700 boxes, Yongxing importing 500 boxes, Jinlong importing 200 boxes, and other Chinese tea firms like Tongfu also having scattered transactions. Prices ranged from 90 yuan to 110 yuan. Transactions for each route's Zhu Mei (珠眉) totaled about 400 boxes for Baolong, and over 100 boxes each for Fushi, Chinese Tea, and Tongfu, with prices ranging from 62 yuan to 68 yuan. Also, Mei (眉) has been actively traded recently, with Xiehe importing about 1,000 boxes, Jinlong 600 boxes, and Tianyu over 100 boxes, with prices ranging from 17 yuan to 38 yuan. Statistics for the entire week show 2,150 boxes of Chou Zhen (抽珍) traded, 3,300 boxes of Zhen Mei (珍眉), and 2,350 boxes of Ji Mei (計眉). Other odd lots of Gong Xi (貢熙) etc. were also traded. Transactions for Da Bang (大帮) Pingshui tea remained slow, but scattered transactions for Zhu Tea (珠茶) totaled about 1,600 boxes, including 400 boxes of Xiao Zhen Mei (小针眉) and 1,300 boxes of Third-Grade Zhen Mei (三號針眉).</p>
<h3>Revived Exports of Chou Xin Zhen Mei (抽芯珍眉)</h3>
<p>Due to the Moroccan war, the sales of Chou Xin Zhen Mei (抽芯珍眉) green tea have been very sluggish in recent weeks. Chinese tea merchants have had to repeatedly lower prices to seek sales. Recently, they have received overseas orders, and foreign firms such as the British firm Qiahe, Tongfu, and Jinlong have absorbed large quantities of goods from Tunxi, with the busiest transactions. Over the past two days, a total of over 1,400 boxes have been traded, with prices ranging from 102 yuan to 105 yuan, a further drop of 7 or 8 yuan compared to before. Colors like Zhen Mei (針眉) and Xiu Mei (秀眉) also continued to be active. Zhu Tea (珠茶) prices remained stable, but the sales of Da Bang (大帮) have turned sluggish to the Americas.</p>
<h3>Self-Respect and Self-Conceit</h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>One must have self-respect, but never self-conceit.</p>
<p>There are many differences between self-respect and self-conceit. Today, I want to talk to you, little friends, about this.</p>
<p>Self-respect means respecting oneself. The meaning of respect is not putting on airs and bossing others around. It means that in terms of one's personality, speech, and thoughts, one always has the "upright and honorable" thought and expresses it in an upright and honorable manner. Whatever one does, it should be in accordance with human feelings and reason, without disrespecting oneself or others. This is self-respect.</p>
<p>I believe that the more one respects oneself, the more one will respect others. Because one can put oneself in another's shoes and understand that others also like to be respected. Therefore, there is mutual respect between people, which is a happy thing, isn't it? Conversely, if you disrespect others, they will treat you badly and disrespect you even more. Therefore, self-respect is not difficult. The highest expression and most beautiful reward of self-respect is to respect others and have them respect you at the same time.</p>
<p>Self-conceit is different. It only knows about oneself and doesn't know about others at all. A self-conceited person thinks that he is the best and most remarkable person in the world. Everyone else is bad. He thinks he can do anything, and better than anyone else. (But you should know that self-conceited people are mostly boastful, untrustworthy.) He looks down on all mankind and belittles all undertakings. He knows that he needs to save face, but he completely disregards the faces of others, treating them with contempt and insult. As a result, everyone hates him, no one is friendly with him, and he becomes a proud, boastful, and isolated person.</p>
<p>Little friends, the difference between self-respect and self-conceit is obvious. Now, please examine yourself and see which type of person you belong to.</p>
<h3>Casual Talks on Children's Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Yisheng</p>
<p>He Yan Draws a Circle</p>
<p>When He Yan was seven years old, his father had already passed away. His mother was taken by Cao Cao, and he lived with his mother in Cao Cao's house. He was unfortunately in the position of what is commonly known as a "stepchild." His intelligence surpassed adults, and he already had the reputation of a child prodigy at that time. Cao Cao was a person who knew people well and really liked him in his heart. He treated him especially well and wanted to adopt him as his adopted son. He Yan also understood Cao Cao's intentions, so he often drew a square frame on the ground and stayed in this narrow, self-restricted place. When others asked him, "What are you doing?" he replied, "This is the He family's house. I live in the He family!" Cao Cao heard this and knew that this child had his own intentions and could not be subdued. Not long after, Cao Cao indeed allowed him and his mother to return to their old home.</p>
<p>Power-hungry traitors, a mother who lost her chastity, placed in such a harsh environment, even the most strong-willed husband would be helpless. But a young child was able to hold on to his principles, not forgetting his own roots, showing outstanding qualities, and eventually made the other party feel that the ancient saying "The three armies can be deprived of their commander, but a common man cannot be deprived of his will" was true, softening down and simply fulfilling the wishes of the mother and son. How great his ambition was! A child still wet behind the ears was able to use reason to move a powerful and influential villain, knowing that this was the only way to achieve his filial thoughts. How high and far-sighted his insight was! Now there is a group of people who are content with being under a fallen nest, cowering and not striving, only knowing how to recognize the enemy as their father, shamelessly serving the enemy. Do they not feel ashamed when they think of He Yan, who was only seven years old?</p>
<h3>Little Black Coal! The Secret of Making Shadow Plays</h3>
<p>— Written by Jiang Yuqi</p>
<p>(1) Little Black Coal hung up a cloth screen with an electric light inside.</p>
<p>(2) He invited children to watch him put on a shadow play.</p>
<p>(3) A big lion appeared on the screen, which was very beautiful.</p>
<p>(4) When the curtain was lifted, the secret was revealed.</p>
<h3>An Adventurous Aviator</h3>
<p>— Seagull</p>
<p>Mittelholzer was a Swiss aviator. Early in his career, he devoted himself to aviation. He participated in Arctic exploration flights; he flew from Africa along the Nile River, through central Africa, all the way to the Cape of Good Hope in the extreme south. He was the first person to fly over many volcanoes in the world.</p>
<p>When he was an aviation apprentice, he aspired to find the secrets of the human world at the ends of the earth. He endured many hardships and hardships.</p>
<p>In 1923, he went to Berlin to participate in Arctic exploration. At a speed of ninety miles per hour, he crossed the Arctic Ocean, overlooking the remains of walking explorers who used to trudge an average of twelve miles a day with sled dogs. There were towering icebergs, like white roses arranged below. Glaciers flowed in parallel to the sea. All sorts of wonders made him forget the anxiety of the icy world.</p>
<p>While flying over Africa, he crossed through the lightning layer of rainstorms in the tropical sky. At that time, the plane suddenly turned into a pot of water, and his whole body was wet like a drowned chicken. He broke through the rain layer and flew to an altitude of more than 10,000 feet. Looking down at the craters of volcanoes from the plane, they looked like black smoke rolling in a large chimney. It was also like a huge circular theatre, intermittently spewing out thick smoke and fire. It was thrilling and unprecedented.</p>
<p>When the plane flew low over the forests and plains of Africa, the roaring engine sound alarmed countless natives and wild animals. Large groups of elephants and 鳄鱼 (alligators) fled in panic. The 土人 (aborigines), seeing something they had never seen before, were frightened and believed that a heavenly god was descending, so they chanted incantations to pray for the rabbit's disaster. He couldn't help but laugh when he saw it.</p>
<p>In Gano, East Africa, he took the chief there and flew low around his palace for several weeks. The beasts in the zoo were almost driven mad with fright. The chief's palace maids swarmed out and looked up at him in front of the courtyard, all trembling and sweating with fear, their eyes fixed and mouths agape.</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you admire aviators? That is truly the most dazzling darling of the 20th century!</p>
<h3>What Does Japan Have?</h3>
<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>Japan is a small island nation in the Pacific Ocean. Its land is truly small, with an area of only 152,300 square miles. Compared to our country, it is like a mouse standing next to an elephant! However, their enterprising determination is much stronger than ours; this is something we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>In the past, Japanese elementary school teachers took many hazelnuts, pears, etc., and distributed them to their students to eat. At the same time, they told them: "Are these things delicious? If you want to eat hazelnuts, go to the Three Eastern Provinces! If you want to eat pears, go to Shandong Province! There are many other good things besides these in China!" From childhood, the words "If you want good things, you must go to China" were deeply imprinted in the minds of elementary school students, so it is no wonder that they become even more extraordinary when they grow up!</p>
<p>"What does Japan have?" You may want to ask that.</p>
<p>"Japan itself has many things!" I am telling you this, but the purpose is not to ask you to rob them of their things, but just to make you aware of them, because we ourselves have many things, so why should we rob others?</p>
<p>Japan is founded on aquatic products, and the amount of fish produced in the Hokkaido area is extremely large and very famous. (1)</p>
<p>The Shimizu Tunnel between Gunma Prefecture and Niigata Prefecture is 9,702 meters long. (2)</p>
<p>Tokyo Station in Tokyo City is a transportation hub and the largest city station in Japan. (3)</p>
<p>Mount Fuji is a famous mountain in Japan, and the top of the mountain is covered with snow all year round, which is very beautiful. (4)</p>
<p>The castle tower in Nagoya City is a very famous ancient site in Japan. (5)</p>
<p>The Great Buddha in Nara City is very large, but compared to the one in Linggang, Shanxi Province in our country, it is not as good as ours. (6)</p>
<p>Osaka is the industrial area of Japan, and the chimneys are towering like bamboo forests. Most of the goods produced are sold to our country. (7)</p>
<p>Kyoto's silk sewing (8) and Nagano's raw silk (10) are also famous products of Japan.</p>
<p>Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture is shaped like a琵琶 (pipa) and has beautiful and pleasant scenery. (9)</p>
<p>The apples in Aomori Prefecture are considered famous in Japan. (10)(1)</p>
<p>The horses produced in the Tohoku region of Hokkaido are considered famous by the Japanese. (10)(2)</p>
<p>In addition, the cattle produced in Korea (10)(3) and the camphor and sugar produced in Taiwan (10)(4) are also very famous, but these things were all snatched from our hands! Perhaps our soybeans in the Northeast will also be included in their famous products in the future!</p>
<p>I hope that after reading this article, the little friends will have a feeling in their hearts, which is "The Japanese are able to develop because they have an enterprising spirit." If we want to develop, of course we need an enterprising spirit!</p>
<h3>Common Sense for Writing Letters</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiongjian</p>
<p>The summer vacation has passed for many days. In the past, you were with teachers and classmates in the same class every day. You have been separated from them for a long time, and you should communicate with them to send greetings or report on your recent situation. So now I am specially telling the little friends the main points of writing letters—</p>
<p>Things to pay attention to when writing an envelope:</p>
<p>(1) The address must be detailed: The recipient's address should be written in detail. For example, the province, county, street, and house number should all be written clearly. There are many counties with the same name in our country. If you don't write the province, it is easy to be misdirected. If you don't write the street and number, the postman often has no way to deliver it. The sender should also write the return address so that if the recipient moves elsewhere and the postman cannot deliver it, it can be returned to the original location.</p>
<p>(2) The handwriting must be clear: The address on the envelope is best written in standard script, and must not be too scribbled, lest the postman does not recognize it.</p>
<p>(3) The date must be stated: The date of mailing should be written on the envelope so that the recipient and the sender can check the contents of the letter later. Things to pay attention to in the content of the letter:</p>
<p>(1) The format should be neat: A neat letter format shows your respect and also shows your seriousness and neat spirit.</p>
<p>(3) Reduce courtesies: When writing a letter, you should avoid many meaningless courtesies and write down what you want to say in a simple and clear way, so that both the writer and the reader can avoid wasting time.</p>
<p>Things to pay attention to when affixing stamps:</p>
<p>(1) Paste firmly: The stamp originally has a kind of glue. When pasting, you can use water to wet it thoroughly. (Some people use saliva on their tongue to paste it, which is very unhygienic; because the gelatin often has microorganisms attached to it, isn't approaching it with the tongue harmful to you?) However, this glue has been around for a long time, or is too thin, and has weak adhesion, so it is easy to say that it falls off. The post office believes that the postage has not been paid, so it is put aside and not sent; or it is considered to be underpaid, and the recipient is fined double the amount. So pay attention to sticking the stamps firmly, it is best to add some paste.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to the position: Affix the stamp in the upper left corner of the front of the envelope, which is convenient for the post office staff to stamp and check; this is also the rule we should follow.</p>
<p>(3) Verify the postage: The postage for a regular letter to various places within the country is 5 cents per letter, and only 2 cents for the local area. However, sometimes the weight of the letter exceeds the specified 20 grams - about the same weight as two copper coins - and additional postage must be affixed. In order to avoid loss or charge the recipient for postage, the postage for overweight letters should be verified.</p>
<h3>Palindrome Poems</h3>
<p>— Chengming</p>
<p>Little friends! I accidentally recalled a palindrome poem. "A Poetic Song Tune" is a seasonal short piece. When I was studying as a child, I would gather with many little friends on summer evenings in the courtyard to enjoy the cool air. Everyone would sing this poem together, and sing it so well that they knew it by heart. What is called a palindrome poem? It means that reading it backwards, the phrases and sounds are the same. There are only ten characters in total: "香蓮碧水勤風凉夏日長 (Fragrant Lotus, Green Water, Diligent Wind, Cool Summer Day Long)." These ten characters are strung together into four lines of seven characters each, making twenty-eight characters. Reading it backwards is still the same phrase, not a single character is different. It is also a very interesting poem! Now I will transcribe this poem as follows:</p>
<p>香蓮碧水動風凉，Water moving in the wind, cool with fragrant lotus,</p>
<p>水動風凉夏日長，Long summer days, cool with fragrant breeze.</p>
<p>長日夏凉風動水，Breezes move the water, as long summer days cool,</p>
<p>凉風動水碧蓮香。The scent of fragrant lotus, moving in green water.</p>

<h3>Little Soldier Song</h3>
<p>— Jin Yun</p>
<p>You fire a gun, I take a knife,</p>
<p>You take a spear, I fire a cannon,</p>
<p>Shouldering a small military flag,</p>

<p>I'm not afraid of gunfire and bullets,</p>
<p>I'm not afraid of planes and cannons;</p>
<p>We are little soldiers,</p>
<p>We are little soldiers,</p>
<p>For the country, for the nation,</p>
<p>Willing to sacrifice!</p>
<p>For freedom, for equality,</p>
<p>Do not be slaves, be masters!</p>
<p>Restore the old mountains and rivers!</p>

<h3>A Letter from Gorky to a Seven-Year-Old Friend</h3>
<p>— Wang Dou, Tang Mei</p>
<p>In November 1910, shortly after the death of the great Russian writer Tolstoy, a young friend, only seven years old, named E. A. Flunkeel, wrote a letter to Maxim Gorky, saying:</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. Gorky:</p>
<p>Now, you are the only great writer left in Russia. So, now I ask you, would you please write more interesting stories and letters for us?</p>
<p>Sincerely, your seven-year-old friend Flunkeel"</p>
<p>After receiving this letter, Gorky wrote the following reply with great pleasure:</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. Flunkeel:</p>
<p>Yes, Tolstoy's "person" has indeed died, but speaking of the "spirit" of the "great" writer, it is still alive! He will always be with us.</p>
<p>In a few years, when you are older, you will be able to read Tolstoy's great works yourself. At this time, you will definitely be very happy, and you will also know that Tolstoy's "spirit" has indeed not died, and will always be with you! Because his art will give you strength.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Flunkeel: I also recommend the works of that excellent writer Korolenko to you. Please ask your father to read you his story called "The Old Man Who Kept the Bell Tower".</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter. The fairy tale you wanted is now sent to you; and three "Xiajiali" postcards are also sent to you.</p>
<p>Gorky replied in Capri"</p>
<h3>The King and the Shepherd Boy (5)</h3>
<p>— New</p>
<p>"Pfft pfft!" He praised with an envious look, as if eating the sweetest candy, making a pfft sound. Then he continued, "Pfft pfft pfft!"</p>
<p>On the same evening, when it was time to go to bed, the blond-haired Hua Le pressed his face against the cold windowpane, gazing longingly at the blue-black sky outside. He thought of the shepherd boy sitting alone in the small mountain, and unknowingly felt a surge of envy, because the young king longed to go out into the darkness to see how mysterious the world was! He secretly wondered in his heart what all the things he usually saw during the day would look like at night?</p>
<p>As soon as he climbed into the soft, golden bed, his mother, the Queen, came in to say goodnight. He threw himself into her jade arms and said, "Oh, Mother, I did so much terrible homework today."</p>
<p>The Queen busily kissed her son on the lips and said softly, "Poor little Hua Le!"</p>
<p>The young king continued, "Oh, Mother, today I saw a very cute child on that little mountain again. Don't you think he is very lucky? He doesn't have to do any homework all day, he just has to play outside with a flock of sheep. Mother, can't we also get a few good sheep with pure white wool to play with?"</p>
<p>His mother replied, "Hua Le, those sheep are not meant to be played with as toys. Watching sheep is actually a responsibility, just like doing your homework."</p>
<p>The young king hurriedly said, "Mother, is watching sheep considered a responsibility too? Then I would rather watch sheep than do homework, but is that child really a shepherd? I think he is about the same age as me, Mother, can't I be a shepherd too?"</p>
<p>The Queen said, "Hua Le, you are actually a shepherd too, but you don't watch sheep, but rather take care of the people. I want you to be a good king, because you are my son, and it would bring glory even to me as your mother."</p>
<p>The young king said again, "Mother, I am willing to try to be a good king, but I also want to go outside and be a proper shepherd. Mother, and I must ask you, do I have to wear this crown all the time? This thing is really too heavy, it feels like it's biting my forehead."</p>
<p>The Queen replied, "Yes, my love, you must wear this crown all the time. You must know that this crown represents that you are the king, and you cannot make any decisions for yourself. Now go to sleep, and dream that you are a shepherd, shivering in the cold wind and rain. Then when you wake up and see yourself lying in a golden bed, you will be happy and content."</p>
<p>But the blond-haired young king Hua Le did not change his mind because of his mother's persuasion, and shouted loudly, "I really want to go out into the wind and rain. The suffocating air inside this door really makes me hate it!"</p>

<h3>Newspapers and Social Ethics</h3>
<p>— Feng Youchen</p>
<p>When we open a newspaper, many political, economic, and social news items come into our view. These news items are all products of the real society in which we live, and they are closely related to our lives. Reading newspapers not only allows us to know what is happening in the world today, but also enables us to synthesize various news items in our daily reading, understand the general political, economic, and social situation, and thus more accurately determine how we should live. Some people say, "Modern newspapers are truly an indispensable necessity of life." This is not an exaggeration in the slightest. We can say that in protecting our physical existence, food, clothing, and shelter are necessary; and in acquiring and advancing knowledge, newspapers are necessary.</p>
<p>Since newspapers are so important to mankind, what are their functions? Some people think that the function of newspapers is to rigidly record news; they say that newspapers are mirrors that reflect social phenomena, and they must always reflect all social phenomena in their original state; they do nothing else. At first glance, such a statement seems quite good, but upon closer examination, it is a very mechanical argument. First of all, newspaper news does not naturally find its way into newspapers, but is selected by journalists and adopted by newspaper offices before appearing in the press. In other words, there is a personal or group subjective effect in between. Secondly, readers do not simply finish reading the newspaper and that's the end of it. The news in the newspaper must activate in their minds, and thus must affect their personal subjective opinions and lives. If the readers of the newspaper live in society, their personal subjective opinions and lives must have an impact on objective society. Then, the effect of the newspaper on the general readers is also its social function. In this way, from the collection and publication of news to the impact of the newspaper on individuals and society after its publication, it can fully show that the newspaper has a great active role, and it is not a dead mirror.</p>
<p>Asa Brisbane said, "...It is wrong and dangerous to merely regard newspapers as simple printed reflecting mirrors." Because if newspapers are only regarded as dead mirrors, then the recording of all news is merely a mechanical reflection of the mirror, and the newspaper itself has no responsibility to speak of. This eliminates the active role of the newspaper and cancels its important social mission, which is of course very dangerous.</p>
<p>Among the general social functions of newspapers, in addition to the political function, the most important is its influence on social morality and ethics. We see that most of the social news in newspapers is closely related to social morality and ethics. Such as fraud, theft, adultery, murder, defamation, breach of trust and other types of news, therefore, every newspaper should actively take on its important social mission, and when publishing that type of news, it is necessary to carefully consider it, and make sure that the published news will not have a bad impact on social ethics and individual morality, so as to give play to the active role of the news itself in teaching. On this point, among many newspapers in China, only Shen Bao can be considered the best. However, some newspapers only know how to cater to the bad tendencies of the general public, and for matters such as illicit affairs between men and women and love killings, they not only publish them in special large red characters, but also add nauseating descriptions and incorrect judgments to promote the development of bad tendencies and lead society towards decadence and depravity. In Japan, something like this happened: When the Arishima Takeo love-death incident occurred, some newspapers used his social status to exaggerate the incident and praised the act of love-death in order to cater to the bad tendencies of society. As a result, it aroused fierce attacks from many people, saying that it was a manifestation of catering to the low-level tastes of some readers and had only a bad influence on social customs. At the same time, there have been similar things in China. For example, the famous movie star Ruan Lingyu's suicide, in her subjective feeling, was because of "gossip is a fearful thing". Of course, we cannot rely on this point to say that the main reason for her suicide was the improper publicity of her love affair or news about her love affair, and that she feared gossip; it should be attributed to the badness of the social system. However, when Ruan Lingyu's love affair case occurred, some newspapers' records were indeed very exaggerated and incorrect. Therefore, the saying "gossip is a fearful thing" is not without basis. At the same time, some public opinions were not fair even after her suicide: these exaggerated and incorrect records, these unfair public opinions, not only damaged Ruan Lingyu's personal reputation, but also had a very bad impact on social morality. These two things can fully prove that newspapers have a positive effect on social morality, but some newspapers intentionally or unintentionally have had a bad effect on social morality in their performance.</p>
<p>Former US President Harding once said this about the implementation of the Seven Laws of News Ethics: "If I were to draft the laws of news ethics today, I would prohibit the reporting of all immoral facts except in cases of social warning..." But we believe that absolutely prohibiting the recording of all immoral events is just as wrong as those exaggerated and incorrect records. Because all immoral events are products of real society. If only events that are considered "moral" by real society are recorded, and immoral facts are not recorded, then objectively it is concealing the ugliness of real society and praising it. The problem is not whether to record all immoral events, but how to record them. For example, a concubine of a high-ranking official, because she is unwilling to live that decadent and depraved concubine life, escapes from that wealthy family and even lives with her lover: for such a thing, we cannot use words such as "elope" or "adulteress" in the record, and we should not describe her personal love affairs as general licentious events and denounce them as immoral. Because that is objectively supporting high-ranking officials to marry a large number of concubines, trampling on women, supporting concubineism, actually opposing gender equality and freedom of marriage, and leading society towards darkness and depravity.</p>
<p>Modern news media has become a huge industry in capitalist society; therefore, many newspapers are like general industrial combinations, and their first purpose is to make profits; as for moral tasks and social functions, they are placed under the purpose of making profits. Mr. Skidelsky, a former reporter for the London "Times", once said: "The huge capital, large factories, complex machinery and organization necessary to produce and sell modern newspapers can be said to have developed newspapers from a 'profession' to an 'industry'. Journalists must write what many industrialists or large shareholders want, which they do not want to write. One of the worst signs of the evils of newspapers today is the neglect of the editorial side and the emphasis on the business side." This is a very accurate criticism of the general newspapers in Europe and the United States, where capitalism is the most developed. Newspapers in those places can be said to be dominated by big financiers and entrepreneurs, and they only know how to cater to their hobbies and don't care about morality at all. For example, recently some newspapers in Europe and the United States, under the control of imperialists and arms dealers, even openly advocate expanding armaments and launching wars: even from the standpoint of general humanitarianism, this is extremely immoral, but they did it anyway.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no definite standard for what is moral and immoral: in the eyes of liberals, it is very proper for a young lady to fall in love with someone or even live with someone without the consent of her family, because the young lady's love is her own business and does not need to be managed by the family; but in the eyes of people who are rich in feudal ideas, that is an unfilial and unchaste licentious act. There are really many problems like this that can express the differences in street concepts in today's society. However, no matter what, newspapers should always take a certain attitude towards general moral issues; if a country's newspapers exist for the country and the nation, and for the majority of the people, not for a minority of privileged people, then the determination of moral standards should be based on the interests of the country and the nation, and based on the moral concepts of the majority of the people. The commonly called newspaper is the public servant of the people should be this meaning.</p>
<p>Staden once said: "Modern newspapers are shifting from the mechanical age, the reporting age, and the capital age to the fourth era of social public servants. That is to say, newspapers are no longer the so-called 'bellwether of society' in the past, and they should use their huge organization and strong mechanical power to serve the broad society as a public servant... The meaning of this public servant is to serve the society, that is, to serve the public..." Under the meaning that newspapers should be public servants of the broad masses of people, we hope that many promising newspapers in the country will strive to eliminate low-level tastes, abandon unfair moral criticisms, and reflect the general demands of the broad masses of people as much as possible, so as to gain a large number of readers. Of course, low-level tastes are liked by idle old masters and old ladies, but these people are ultimately in the minority; if newspapers want to increase sales, they can only combine with the majority of people to move forward and improve their content day by day. I think some newspapers in China are really too old-fashioned and too commercialized, and there is no new atmosphere of progress in any aspect; if such a newspaper appeared at this time; that is, regardless of content and form, regardless of the viewpoint of speech, the position and tone of recording news, the form of typesetting,... all of which are different from those completely commercialized and old-fashioned newspapers, and can show a completely new progressive trend, then there will inevitably be a big sensation in the Chinese press or cultural circles, and the quality and quantity of its readers will inevitably exceed those backward newspapers.</p>

<h3>Review of "The Lost Lamb"</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huanpu</p>
<p>In the fashionable and fresh "Children's Year", most of what we see and hear in newspapers or speeches at gatherings are words of "praise and praise". Everyone tramples "reality" under their feet, and enthusiastically opens what "Children's Education Equipment Exhibition" or "Children's Toy Exhibition"... and specially makes "Children's Films", and also says they want to "open children's banks"... With celebrities advocating in the front, and singers responding in the back, the whole of China's children seem to have stepped onto "heaven" in one step! However, paint cannot cover up stains, and facts speak louder than eloquence. What "benefits" did the general children on the streets and alleys get in this lively "Children's Year"? "The Lost Lamb" boldly grasps this unreasonable "reality" in terms of its editing!</p>
<p>The opening of "The Lost Lamb" is the best-sounding "children's education" that everyone gets in "Children's Year". The teacher's incompetence and the simplicity of the equipment in that elementary school are what everyone thinks is unacceptable, but aren't children in rural China still receiving the so-called "school education" there?</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Speaking of this, everyone may say that children in cities can receive some better education. Then, let's take a look at Xiao Sanzi. He can write words and read books in the magnificent school in the city, but he cannot change his bad habit of stealing that he has acquired. Let's take a look at Xiao Sanzi's classmates. At such a young age, they are cunning and eccentric, and they have no understanding or sympathy for the poor and the weak. May I ask what is the use of this kind of education for today's children? The principals and teachers who consider themselves to be "teaching the ignorant" finally realize their own educational incompetence, but they do not study or seek improvement, and only call on students to drop out of school themselves. May I ask what is the use of this kind of principal and teacher for today's children?... However, as long as we look around, such schools and such people who run education "shoulder" the responsibility of Chinese children's education"!</p>
<p>"The Lost Lamb" uses "contrast" to show the iron-like "reality" in its performance, which is the most ingenious technique and the most effective method. A group of children without fathers or mothers, without clothes or food, and rejected by society, they also demand physical and mental comfort like other delicate children! Nutritious and beautiful biscuits and candies are placed in front of them, but separated by a layer of transparent glass, making them reachable but unattainable! Toys that conform to children's psychology and supplies that are rich in children's educational meaning are displayed in front of them, and Shan Ben'er's mouth calls out for all the poor children: "I want that horse too!" But who will listen to their calls except for the cold wind on a snowy night? Who will satisfy their demands? The educational film "Everyone should watch it", excludes them, this group of "children", and intimidates them with the big stick of the guarding police. As for the "bank for children's education savings", it is certainly not established for them!</p>
<p>This large section of contrast focuses the public's attention on "reality", not only giving people a strong stimulus, but also giving people a very deep memory.</p>
<p>In addition to this, "The Lost Lamb" also uses the method of contrast to prove the opposition of classes.</p>
<p>From the time when Shen Cihang returned to Shanghai after lending money in the countryside and did not allow Xiao Sanzi, who was homeless and helpless, to be brought along, but hid him for the old servant to take away, until the old servant shouted: "Is there any justice in this world?" and angrily abandoned his original job, took Xiao Sanzi out of Shen Cihang's house, rented a small thatched house, and took in that group of homeless children on the rainy night, the consciousness of class is becoming more and more obvious and more and more profound, like ascending stairs. When Shen Cihang returned home to celebrate his birthday, there was the fragrance of clothes and flowers, and the guests were full of the hall, but who noticed the group of hungry children secretly standing outside the window? Only the poor old servant secretly gave them leftovers. Xiao Sanzi, who was faint from hunger, fell down on the marble (?) steps of the nobleman, and no one paid attention for a long time. It was still his partner "Xiao Qiaozui" who picked up garbage who rescued him. When Xiao Sanzi was wronged and expelled from Shen Cihang's house, the general heartless lackeys were "helping the tyrant to do evil", and only the old and poor old servant was moved by righteousness and shouted: "Is there any justice in this world?" and resolutely took Xiao Sanzi away regardless of everything. On a rainy night, every household's door was tightly closed, who would care about the poor children on the streets and alleys who were as cold and shivering as drowned chickens? Only the old servant, who was both bitter and poor, took them in. Some people may say "God has eyes", there are indeed "good people", but "where are the good people?" Is it not only the poor who understand the pain of the poor, value the pain of the poor, sympathize with the pain of the poor, and try to comfort the pain of the poor? Rich people, after eating their fill, either "have love affairs" or "think about their sons", either try to cheat others, or hold banquets and celebrate birthdays to show their brilliance. They disdain to ask about the pain of the poor who are "also human beings". In fact, they live in "heaven" and do not understand the pain of the poor, so they will never extend a hand to help. Even if there is, it is nothing more than like Shen Cihang, taking the "corpses" of the poor to raise his own social status!</p>
<p>However, it seems difficult for a work of art to reach the highest level and be completely without flaws. "The Lost Lamb" has such emphasis on consciousness, and in the eyes of some audiences who do not understand enough, it is inevitable that they will fall into the "heroism" error that ordinary people often make when they are moved by righteousness. For example, when the old servant saw Xiao Sanzi being wronged, he angrily took him out, wanting to rescue him with his own power; on a night of strong wind and rain, when he saw the poor children who had no home to go to, he was moved by human sympathy and took them in, again wanting to rescue them with his own power: this was certainly the action he should have taken, but the fact itself had no result. He taught them: don't steal, don't be lazy, work hard, but the big mouth of unemployment swallowed them up! Later, although the children wanted to practice his teachings: "don't steal", it was ultimately impossible. Hunger drove them, and they finally "committed theft" again!</p>
<p>In addition, the sad atmosphere of the whole play is too heavy, especially the ending of the old servant forms a pessimistic scene of "nothing more than this"! He sacrificed his job for "justice", and became a beggar for "saving the children", but in the end, the old and weak life was only swallowed up by freezing and starvation! People who know that they must struggle to live a "human" life will certainly not be affected by this ending, but those with weak wills may even be discouraged because of this.</p>
<p>However, borrowing the mouths of the children to say the words that everyone wants to say but dares not say, and to sing the songs that everyone wants to sing but dares not sing, this tragedy has had a huge effect!</p>
<p>In terms of technique, the material taken in each scene is very appropriate, and the first few scenes are really exquisite and can be called a masterpiece of art. The light is also very uniform, but unfortunately the melody of the music and the progress of the plot cannot be consistent.</p>
<p>The protagonist Xiao Sanzi is very energetic, but the expression of his personality seems to have destroyed his consistency because of the drama. At first, he was a somewhat timid child, then he became a bit silly in the middle, and finally he became a very brave and healthy child.</p>
<p>Zheng Junli's old servant is really cute.</p>
<p>Li Zhuozhuo's Mrs. Shen does her best to be a concubine in the city, and in the section that exposes the sins of the city, her performance makes it even more powerful.</p>
<p>Shen Baining's Shen Cihang and Mrs. Shen's lover are really too "clumsy", and some places are diminished by their clumsiness.</p>
<p>The other supporting roles can still be just right.</p>
<p>In short, "The Lost Lamb" is worth introducing to the public. In this "Children's Year" era of 1926, being able to use real facts to target "reality", criticize "reality", and put "reality" piece by piece in front of the public, the performance of "The Lost Lamb" seems to be still a pioneering work.</p>
<p>Some people say that "The Lost Lamb" has no story and no ending: but aren't the bankruptcy of the countryside, the exile of farmers, the unemployment caused by imperialist oppression, the closure of factories and shops, the capitalists' conspiracies, and the corruption of their private lives all the most meaningful stories in the history of modern progress? As for the ending of "The Lost Lamb", it was originally not the playwright's business. It is we who watch the play who should clean up this scene. Aren't the children hiding in dangerous high-rise buildings waiting for us to rescue them?</p>

<h3>Japanese Nearsightedness</h3>
<p>— Tian Dongsheng</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, the number of nearsighted people in Japan is truly astonishing: among the 12 million elementary school children in Japan, nearsightedness accounts for 18.47% (2 million in real numbers): among middle school students, nearsightedness accounts for 35.04% (350,000 people in real numbers): among specialized school students, it accounts for 47.48% (52,000 people); there are even more nearsighted people in universities, accounting for 47.48% of the total number (52,000 people), almost half. In addition, there are certainly many nearsighted people among other Japanese citizens.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of the Olympic Games</h3>
<p>— Ti Ren</p>
<p>Since August 2nd, we have seen the words "Eleventh Olympic Games" in the newspapers every day. Although the games have now closed, various news about them continue to appear in the newspapers. As a result, I think anyone who reads the newspaper must have a very deep impression of the words "Olympic." Everyone must also know that the so-called "Olympic Games" means the "World Games." But why are the "World Games" called the "Olympic Games"? What is its past history? This cannot be explained in a few words.</p>
<p>The so-called "Olympic" is originally the name of a place in Greece. In the past, every four years, the Greek people held a grand festival for the main god in this place, and held various competitions such as sports, literature, and music in front of the god. This was the origin of the Olympic Games. However, this kind of competition was still a kind of ancient expression of worshiping gods, and did not have the meaning of modern sports events. Later, with the development of capitalism and the progress of sports in various countries, this kind of god-worshipping Olympic Games was revived in the modern sense and form, and became the World Games. The fact of this development is this: on June 16, 1894, the capitalist countries of the world held a meeting in Paris and decided to hold the World Games once every four years according to the ancient Greek style. After this decision, the first World Games was held in Athens, the capital of Greece, in 1896. This was the beginning of the World Olympic Games. As for the basis for the World Games being called the Olympic Games, that is of course this historical fact.</p>
<p>The earliest initiator of the modern Olympic Games was the Frenchman Coubertin. At the opening of the 11th Games this year, all the members of the International Olympic Committee jointly wrote to the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, requesting that this year's Peace Prize be awarded to Mr. Coubertin. At the same time, Mr. Coubertin himself said: "The restoration of the Olympic Games, in the modern living conditions, gathers the people of the world once every four years, and competitions based on trust, peace and etiquette, can form the supreme form of internationalism." He also said: "It is often difficult to judge to what extent the Olympic concept has progressed, but judging from all aspects of its inception, its definition is very clear: to create and strengthen the friendly relations of peaceful contact between civilized countries. Two: To clarify and eliminate the self in sports and the means to seek fair judgment for everyone's games, and to make the competition not a victory for the joy of youth." In this way, the Olympic Games seems to be a symbol of peace. But in fact, its origin has fully demonstrated the spirit of free competition of capitalism. Looking at the history of the Olympic Games, which games has not shown the opposition of sports competition among the great powers? As for the fact that various countries have wasted a lot of energy and money in order to defeat others in each game and "win glory for the country," the 11th Games held in Berlin this year was declared open by Hitler. In various competitions, the competition among various countries was no less than their political and military struggles. The dispute between the Peruvian and Austrian football games even caused the opposition between the Americas and Europe, showing the contradictions and hatred between capitalist countries. Based on these historical facts, the Olympic Games has no meaning of peace. As for the sentence "competition is not a victory for the joy of youth" for the World Games, everyone knows that it is completely the opposite meaning.</p>
<p>The Olympic Games appeared with the development of capitalism. What it shows is the competition of sports in various countries, so the results of its various competitions are of course progressing day by day with the development of industry and the development of the idea of ​​winning competition. From the first games held in Athens in 1896 to the recent games held in Berlin, forty years have passed, and eleven games have been held. In each of them, the highest new record has been announced, and the results of various competitions have been higher than once. Now, in order to make readers more aware of this development trend, we can list the records of various important track and field events in the first Olympic Games forty years ago—</p>
<p>100 meters 12 seconds 400 meters 54.2 seconds</p>
<p>800 meters 2 minutes 11.1 seconds 1500 meters 4 minutes 33.2 seconds</p>
<p>High hurdles 17.6 seconds High jump 1.81 meters</p>
<p>Pole vault meters 3.30 meters Long jump 6.35 meters</p>
<p>Triple jump meters 13.71 meters</p>
<p>These were the highest achievements in various important track and field events at that time. However, if you compare it with the records of this Games, it will appear very weak. The highest records in track and field events in this Games are: 100 meters - 10.3 seconds (American Owens); 400 meters - 46.5 seconds (American Williams); 800 meters - 1 minute 52.9 seconds (American Woodruff); 1500 meters - 3 minutes 47.8 seconds (New York Flock); Triple jump person). From this comparison, we can know the speed of progress of various sports competitions in the world.</p>
<p>In terms of countries, the most developed capitalist countries dominate in each Games. For example, the United States has won the championship in many competitions in almost every Olympic Games, with a great momentum to overwhelm the world; this is just like its capitalist development is above all countries in the world.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be stated that the sixth Olympic Games was suspended due to the last World War. It was not held until the end of the Great War in 1920. Speakers all said that this was a manifestation of the imperialist military struggle replacing their sports competitions. This Games decided that the next Games will be held in Tokyo in 1940, but judging from the current international situation, it is feared that it will be in danger of suffering the same fate as the sixth Games.</p>
<p>A Week's Travel</p>
<h3>A Trip to Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>— Shu Ping</p>
<p>It was during the spring break this year that I played in Suzhou for two days with five or six friends. That finely woven and soft Suzhou has red peach green willows, slowly running horse-drawn carriages, and petite and beautiful girls. The mountains are so low and beautiful, the water is so slow and gentle, and the weather is the lazy sun and gentle breeze. Our rough and unruly nature is not in harmony with the pink peach juice, so we feel a little tired and bored, and want to broaden our horizons and go to the quiet and wild places. But only I and Ji had the courage. We took very little money and set off rashly to Taihu Lake with a map in hand.</p>
<p>We took a small motorized boat from outside Xumen in Suzhou to Dongshan Town at the foot of Taihu Mountain, and set off at 9:00 am. The so-called motorized boat is just a motor head added to the front of an ordinary sailboat. The navigation in the inland rivers of Jiangnan is mostly. The boat travels very slowly, only about ten miles per hour, almost as slow as people walking on the shore. We are not in a hurry for the boat to go fast, because the scenery on both sides needs to be appreciated slowly. There is Hengtang, the place where Xi Shi picked lotus flowers: there is Shihulake, that is, "the waters of Dongting in a stone fish lake are about to flood the green of Junshan"; there is Lingyanshan, where the King of Wu built the Guawa Palace and the Guling Terrace. Both sides of the river are covered with green willows and peach blossoms, and not far away there are clear and green lakes, which just fit the two sentences "The Jiang flowers are as red as fire when the sun rises, and the Jiang water is as green as when spring comes". Small wooden boats carry farmers and women to the fields to work, planting rice and picking mulberry. The famous mandarin ducks are produced near Taihu Lake. They sing to you in the shade of the willows on the shore, and the passengers on the boat are not lonely at all. In this intoxication of spring and nature, we unconsciously arrived at Dongshan.</p>
<p>The sun was setting, it was about 4:00 pm. You can't see Taihu Lake in Dongshan, you can only see a big mountain three or four miles away. This mountain is called Molishan, and there is a peak on it called Molifeng. To go from Tiandongshan to Moli, you have to pass through Dianqian Town at the foot of the mountain. It was already five o'clock when we walked to Dianqian. Following the small path and climbing the kudzu vines, we climbed up Moli in one breath. This is the highest peak on Dongting Mountain. A vast expanse of water appeared before our eyes. The setting sun, which was about to disappear, still had traces of red halo, which poured on the vast lake surface, reflecting golden fish scales. Two or three fishing boats were also gradually returning to the lake shore. The huge lake was left with only greatness and silence.</p>
<p>We felt very hungry in our stomachs. We couldn't find any food in the wilderness. We went into the Moli Temple and insisted on the monk giving us the cold rice in the pot to eat. He had no choice but to let us gobble it up. Our purpose was to cross Taihu Lake overnight and go to Xidongting Mountain in the lake. There is a Baoshan on that mountain, and the monks on it are our fellow villagers. We had inquired about it in Suzhou. So we put our legs together and slid down the lazy slope. There are bayberries, pine trees, peaches, plums, and loquats on the slope. It was the time when various fruits were ripe, but it was already dusk, and we had no intention to pick ownerless peaches and plums.</p>
<p>All the villages in Taihu Lake are distributed along the mountains and rivers, and the upper half of the mountain is deserted and uninhabited. We arrived at a town, not knowing what it was called. The women and children inside all came out, and the dogs barked at us even more. They were making a fuss, pointing east and west. More and more people gathered around us. We didn't understand a word, and we couldn't ask for directions. They thought we were fishermen, but we regarded this place as a peach blossom garden. But they did not "welcome us to their homes, set up wine and kill chickens for food," but were just surprised at us. We kept walking to the lake, wanting to achieve our goal. It took a long time to beckon a small boat. We asked the man to take us to Xishan and asked him how much money he wanted, but he just shook his head. We didn't know if it was too late for him to go, or if we couldn't cross the lake at night at all, we didn't understand. Looking at the golden Taihu Lake, the dense forest, surrounding me,</p>
<p>The Scenery of Greater Shanghai</p>
<h3>Enjoying the Cool Breeze Atop a Skyscraper</h3>
<p>— Chong</p>
<p>In front of the racecourse in the First Special District of Shanghai stands the 22-story International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Because it is the only tall building in East Asia, it is called a "skyscraper." It has been famous throughout the country since its completion. However, because it is too noble and gorgeous, it often makes people of the "common people" class feel intimidated, and it inevitably only becomes a place for a few property owners to relax and play. Therefore, its infinite scenery and many wonderful things are known to very few people. A few days ago, I was taken by a friend and was able to openly enter the building as a commoner, walk through the rooms, and take a cursory look at the contents of the skyscraper, and enjoyed the cool breeze for a long time on the twenty-first floor.</p>
<p>Now let me talk about the twenty-first floor first. When I first entered this hotel, and walked into the elevator with my friend, I thought, how slow will the elevator be? Who knew that in less than a minute, the elevator door opened, and the driver asked us to go out, saying that we had arrived. I quietly asked the guide friend, and he said: "This elevator is extremely fast, traveling three hundred feet per second. What is the twenty-first floor?" As he spoke, he led me past the escalator on the twenty-first floor, pointing to the elevator engine and asking me to look at it. I didn't understand much else, but at a glance, the countless bundles of wires winding around already made people sigh in wonder. Due to the foundation, the open space on the twenty-first floor is not very large, but a small twenty-odd-foot-square veranda-style observation deck, with the highest point of the twenty-second floor covered on it. It is said that the fire department is sending people to be stationed there for observation. The east, south, and west sides are all inlaid with thick glass, 20 feet wide and 10 feet high. The entire city of Shanghai and the nearby counties can be seen at a glance. Looking east, you can clearly see the towering chimneys in Pudong, the mainland of Chuansha County, and the vast East China Sea; looking south, you can see the winding Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway passing the bridge over Songjiang and the scenery upstream of the Huangpu River, and you can also see the famous Chinese Catholic shrine, Songjiang Yushan. Looking west, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is also clearly visible, layer upon layer of green fields, cobweb-like river ports, boundless, until near Kunshan, the line of sight is blocked. Autumn clouds in clusters, brocade clouds in pieces, make people feel refreshed and know that they are in the palace of Chang'e. The glass windows are inlaid firmly to avoid danger. But it doesn't feel stuffy there. Standing at the window opened next to the escalator on the north side, you immediately feel the feeling of being in a high place and unable to bear the cold.</p>
<p>However, because the location of the fourteenth floor of the hotel is just right, it is closed into a ballroom and elegant seats, and it is called the "Skyscraper Hall." The layout there is indeed dignified and luxurious. In the south end, there is a square open hall, where you can dance in the middle, and square dining tables are arranged around the middle empty space. The north end is also square, but the layout is not the same as the south end. In the middle of this open hall, there is also a circular dance floor (performances are held on it). The upright place is also relatively high, just right, the fourteenth floor is also the junction of the hotel from wide to narrow, so this Skyscraper Hall has a special glass roof, with a very beautiful pattern and iron frame holding a translucent large piece of glass, it is said that: when the night is full of stars and moons, you can also take off the glass, so that this Skyscraper Hall is transformed into an open-air garden, so that travelers can arbitrarily observe the sky. Behind the music stage in the hall, two small doors are hidden in the curtain, and going north is the Chinese and Western kitchen. It should also be the only large-scale cooking room in Shanghai or even China? In the cold air room attached to the kitchen, the entire hotel's travelers' meals can be refrigerated for three months, so fresh vegetables can be arbitrarily preserved regardless of the season. There is also a "dishwashing machine" room, which can wash the bowls and utensils used to hold food quickly, much, and cleanly (and there are special machines for washing silverware). Moreover, there is another elevator in the kitchen dedicated to transporting vegetables and supplies, which can carry about one ton of things, making it very convenient to go up and down.</p>
<p>From the fifteenth floor to the twentieth floor, it is said that they are all permanent resident guests, called apartments. There are guest rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, servant rooms, etc., and there are dedicated private elevators. However, the monthly expenses cannot be asked for less than three thousand yuan, but at present, all five floors are full of guests, which shows that there are also rich people in China. From the fifth floor to the thirteenth floor are all guest rooms. The layout is generally the same as other famous hotels in Shanghai, but there are many unique ideas in terms of novelty. For example, when you open the door and enter the passage, there are wardrobes on both sides, and bathrooms on the side, and there are small shelves on the passage to place luggage. Each call attendant's doorbell is also equipped with a small round light outside the door. When you press the doorbell, the bell rings and the light lights up. When the bell stops ringing and the person does not come, the light is always on, so you can check the diligence of the attendant and the speed of service. There is also a rule that all guest rooms are based on a single person (each room ranges from a dozen yuan a day to dozens of yuan a day). If it is declared in advance that it is for two people (especially female guests must not stay until 11:00 pm if the family relationship is not declared in advance), then double bedding (beds, bedding, etc.) will be prepared to prevent this from being used as a place for secret meetings, which is harmful to social customs. It is said that the hotel built a special house on Da Xi Road several months before the opening to train attendants, and hired experts to teach attendant studies, strictly training attendants, spending more than 10,000 yuan without hesitation. The current Minister of Industry, Wu Dingchang, heard about it and praised it, and presented a poem to Mr. Lu and Mr. Zhang, who presided over the attendants (the two gentlemen co-authored a book on attendant studies, which is used as training handouts). There is a poem that says: "Oil, salt, firewood, rice, sauce, vinegar and tea, cleaning and response are as numerous as hemp. A new Analects is well-versed, and guests from all over the world are like returning home!" The fourth floor is the general office. When we went to visit, we saw many attendants coming and going. When we asked why, we knew that they had just finished training and were returning to their duties. The response was extremely polite. The third floor is a very large lounge, with sofas and magazine racks in the west and south. This place is specially prepared for travelers to rest, meet guests, smoke, and read newspapers. Looking out from the large glass windows, a beautiful urban picture book is reflected in the line of sight, and the spirit is refreshed. An American-style latest-style bar is set up in the east, for travelers to eat, drink tea, and snacks, but the seats are arranged in front of the counter, fully allowing free access to food (this is extremely popular in Europe and America, and is also commonly seen in shadow plays). Down to the second floor, there is another dining hall, the layout of which is very different from the Skyscraper Hall. The south is circular, while the north is rectangular. It can be used for more than two hundred travelers and hundreds of people to gather for meals in the entire hotel. My friend and I lingered here for a long time. Not only did the heat disappear completely, but I also felt like I was in the Guanghan Palace. Looking down at the sweating figures on the road, I felt that there was also a paradise on earth to escape to, but unfortunately, such happiness is difficult to enjoy for long. I heard that the hotel has a special department to manage all projects such as water and electrical machinery, which is like a small-scale ideal country.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>The villagers who were watching gradually disappeared into the thick fog and darkness. I had to give up the idea of ​​crossing the lake and seek a home on the shore of the lake.</p>
<p>Walking along the lake, sometimes entering a bay lane, sometimes arriving at a peninsula, sometimes climbing mountains, and sometimes crossing streams. In this dim night, in the lonely and quiet mountain sky, and the dark and boundless Taihu Lake, except for the sound of the wind blowing the branches, the wild birds flying in the trees, and the half-bright and half-dark, flickering fishing fire at the foot of the mountain opposite Xishan, the universe and the earth were all asleep. Only the sound of our footsteps and the sound of our gasps kept the rhythm there. Where is our home in this vast land? We didn't dare to talk, for fear of eavesdropping by strongmen; we didn't dare to rest, for fear that wild beasts would come out and devour us; we only marched forward firmly and bravely, no matter where we stayed, we were not afraid that the night would never come to an end.</p>
<p>After walking about twenty or thirty miles, around nine o'clock, we saw a figure in the distance. Is he a robber? How can he still be walking alone on this barren mountain at this night? Never mind him, even if he is a tiger or leopard, we have to go forward, there is no way to retreat. Fortunately, he was a peddler who traveled between Taihu Lake and Suzhou. He continued to speak the Suzhou dialect, and said to us: "If you keep walking like this, you won't be able to find a place to stay until tomorrow morning. You can only turn left, and you can return to Dianqian to rest soon." When he was about to leave, he said again: "The mountain is very quiet, there are no robbers." According to his instructions, we returned to Dianqian around ten o'clock. The people were also sleeping quietly, so we had to knock on the door for lodging.</p>
<p>It was already early in the morning. We then followed the old road again, and looked for the ferry boat in Yangwan on the lake shore according to what the peddler said last night. The valleys and streams we passed last night, the terrifying tall pines and jagged rocks, and the forests that we didn't know what they contained, have all become wonderful scenery under the sunlight today. Mountain birds are singing, mountain flowers are smiling at us, and herdsmen are also leisurely playing there. Dots of fishing boats on the lake shore set off into the lake in a line again.</p>
<p>The Yangwan ferry boat will not depart until 3:00 pm. We washed our feet on the lake shore again, followed the village women who were washing vegetables to her home to taste the famous Bu Cai, and wrote a letter to a friend, entrusting the small merchant who was going to Suzhou to post it. The letter read "Yangwan, under Dongshan, Taihu Lake on a certain day."</p>
<p>The ferry boat departed, and the east, which had been climbing for a day and a night, gradually separated from us. Isn't that Molifeng? That is a certain town that surprised the villagers last night, that is the ferry head that the boatman would not take us to, and that is the hill where the peddler turned. Ah! So that's what Dongshan is like, "I don't know the true face of Mount Lu, just because I am in this mountain." The thirty-mile-wide lake passed in less than an hour and a half. Only the two of us on the boat are strangers, and the others are small vendors and workers in this lake. Everyone was silent, only looking at the erratic spring swallows and sand gulls.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Zhenxia on Xidongting Mountain, it was even more a place where the language was incomprehensible and the customs were different. Fortunately, we met a fourth-grade elementary school student. He knew a few words roughly, and could speak a few words of Suzhou dialect. He was our only translator. He led us to Baoshan—an ancient temple in the pine and cypress forest. We knocked on the temple door, and the monks had all gone to the mountains or to the town. So we returned to Zhenxia. Next to an ancient tomb on the way, we also drew a Go board with stones on the stone slab and played a few corners of Go before going back.</p>
<p>Zhenxia is the most lively of the thirty-six towns in Xishan. Hundreds of fishing boats gathered on the lake shore when the setting sun was setting. Old women exploring mulberry on the mountains, farmers planting rice in the fields, and peddlers traveling to other villages and towns all went home to rest. Smoke rose everywhere, and fishing fire dotted the water. The hazy night descended. We stayed in an old woman's house at night. She was the owner of the only hotel in this lake. The bed was in the awning set up on the water's edge. The whistling lake wind, the rustling sound of the water, accompanied by the bean-sized tung oil lamp, took the clothes, shoes, and hats, all as pillows, and stuffed the only few banknotes and small foreign coins into the socks. The fatigue of the day, mixed with the incessant croaking of frogs, lulled us into sleep. We had a dream like this: robbers stole our clothes and hats from under our pillows, and took off our socks, throwing both of us into the lake with a thud. When we woke up in surprise, the bean-sized lamp had already gone out, and there was no sound of people in the town. The frogs were no longer croaking, and we could only hear the whistling lake wind and the rustling sound of the water. The universe was empty and silent.</p>
<p>On the third day, we visited Shigong Mountain and climbed to Piaomiao Peak. This is the highest peak in Taihu Lake. The 36,000 hectares of ocean, the seventy-two small islands, the thirty-six villages and towns at the foot of Xishan, the east Dongshan, Lingyan, Dengwei, Tianping, Shangfang peaks, and Gusu City, the north Wuxi, Huishan, the west Yi and Yu, and the south Huzhou, are all in sight. Taihu Lake is great, it is an inland sea, and it is the first large body of water I have seen in my life! It is said that there are thousands of fishing boats in the lake, and tens of thousands of people live by fishing. Its rich reserves are truly amazing!</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the evening, we arrived at Zhou Town. The ships from Wuxi to Huzhou take passengers here. In that dark night, the ship broke through the waves and dragged us into the Huzhou River. Looking back, we could no longer see Xidongting Mountain, which was thirty or forty miles away, and we could no longer see Dongdongting Mountain, which was more than a hundred miles away. We only saw a piece of darkness; we didn't know whether it was the sky or the lake surface, only the stars above and below were twinkling. So we left Taihu Lake, which had been circling for three days.</p>
<h3>Assorted Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Ye Yun</p>
<p>Lu Donglai said: "To compete on horses, one turns to Bole for judgment; to compete on right and wrong, one turns to Confucius for judgment. However, to praise a horse simply because Bole praises it, one cannot avoid being ignorant of horses; to praise a person simply because Confucius praises them, one cannot avoid being ignorant of people." How vast is the difference between these two?</p>
<p>Wen Gong rejected Mencius while singularly admiring Yang Xiong; Jing Gong abolished the Spring and Autumn Annals while singularly revering the Rites of Zhou; Dongpo criticized King Wu while instead considering Xun Kuang to be among the sages. People's likes and dislikes can be truly strange.</p>
<p>When Wen Jiao was carrying out Liu Kun's orders, his mother, heading north, tore his hem to stop him. When Deng You was fleeing from the disaster of Shi Le, his son followed him, and he tied him to a tree and left him. Even after a thousand years, it still causes regret. Examining the actions of encouraging advancement at that time, Jiao was not indispensable. Yet Wen Jiao cruelly disobeyed his mother's wishes, causing her to harbor lifelong resentment, and disrupting her funeral arrangements. The pursuit of fame and success was merely a stepping stone to tragedy.</p>
<p>Liu Yi loved righteousness. When Emperor Xian moved west, he scattered all his treasures, keeping only carts and horses, which he used to return east. Seeing scholars and officials dying of illness on the road, Yi used his horses to exchange for coffins and burial shrouds for them. He also encountered acquaintances suffering from hunger and starvation, so he slaughtered an ox to save them. The people stopped him, but Yi said, "To see death and not offer aid is not the act of a man of principle." Consequently, they all died of hunger. The scholars of the Eastern Han were so deceptively agitated, fond of fame, and lacking in weighing the importance of matters.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Writings</p>
<h3>Trivial Records of Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>— A Zhi</p>
<p>Shi Ba La</p>
<p>The spherical carvings atop the pillars of the stone steps inside and outside the gates of the Forbidden City (such as the Xihe, Xiehe, Taihe gates), all those shaped like flower heads, invariably have small holes pierced at the top of several spheres near the gate openings. Those who are unfamiliar with these objects often suspect that they are made of stone and have been weathered and eroded by wind and rain over the years, causing damage unrelated to historical relics. In fact, these objects are called "alarm signals," also known as "Shi Ba La," or "stone sea whistles." In the event of an alarm, the imperial palace would be surrounded, and the imperial guards would blow into the stone spheres, producing a sound like a conch shell, which would clearly reach the inner court, allowing them to prepare for resistance, escape, or martyrdom. The name "alarm signal" is known to all bannermen who served as imperial guards or escorts, as well as to a group of eunuchs and guards who have long served in the inner court. Therefore, some people in the Beijing newspapers who discuss historical anecdotes have also mentioned this. However, when these spherical objects were created and how they were blown is known to very few.</p>
<p>When the Qing Shunzhi Emperor first arrived in Yanjing, he ordered the Imperial Guard Office (i.e., the Imperial Guard Department in later years) to install "Shi Ba La" at all gates in the inner court.</p>
<p>The matter was overseen by the Grand Minister of the Imperial Guard. They were divided into inner, outer, and front three circles: The Shi Ba La in palaces such as Qianqing, Kunning, Ningshou, and Cining were called the "inner circle," also known as the "Great Inner Guard," and were managed by the escort guards stationed in the inner court. The gates of Shenwu, Donghua, and Xihua were called the "outer circle," also known as the "gate guard," and were also managed by the escort guards. The "Shi Ba La" at gates such as Qianqing, Jingyun, Longzong, and Yangxin were managed by the imperial guards, called the "front circle," also known as the "outer circle inner guard." Those at the Three Great Halls and gates such as Taihe and Xiehe were managed by the imperial guard troops, called the "rear circle," also known as the "outer circle outer guard." When an alarm was raised, they would be blown simultaneously. The method of blowing involved first using a "small copper horn," slightly over three inches long, shaped like a bull's horn trumpet. Usually, it was tied to the end of the tobacco pouch string. Today, some still use ox horns as ornaments, which is a legacy of this practice. By inserting it into the stone hole and blowing into the horn, the air inside the stone's cavity would create a sound like a bull's roar. This object was not allowed to be taken outside the palace, nor was it allowed to be imitated, as it was said to be a type of military supply for the imperial guard camp.</p>
<p>Wine Stores</p>
<p>In Fuzhou, wine shops are collectively called "wine stores." Is this a continuation of the name of the official wine store of the Song Dynasty? Li Fanxie's "Miscellaneous Records of Shucheng" states: "In the Song Dynasty, wine and vinegar were all brewed in official stores, and the money was paid to the Ministry of Revenue. In Lin'an, there were wine stores and vinegar stores." According to the "History of the Song Dynasty," the wine stores in Lin'an all had official names. The "Menglianglu" by Wu Zimu records stores such as the Zhujie Store, Xinjie Store, South Store, and North Store. Furthermore, all the stores had official names, and singing girls devised methods to sell wine. Lin Changyi's "Shooting Crane Tower Poetry Talk" records that Sa Yuheng's "Fujian Palace Poems" mentions: "The wine store has newly received the remains of the wine press." Zhu Zhuyi's inscription on the "Hong Sheng Drinking Wine Picture" states: "The wine store in the capital has opened six times." "Miscellaneous Records of Dongcheng" states: "From the time Wang Anshi established methods to sell wine in the Song Dynasty, he also controlled the rights to vinegar. After the Southern Crossing, military expenses were vast and could not be reformed. Thus, the existence of official wine stores began from this point." Fei Gun's "Leisurely Notes from Liangxi" states: "When Dongpo was in Qi'an, there was the line 'Spring River green floods with grape wine.'" During the Jingkang period, Han Zicang, a drafter, was the magistrate and had an imperial edict to brew in the bestowed county, hence he named his store "Grape Wine," which can also be used as evidence. According to Bai Xiangshan's wine store poem: "Where is this old man rich? His wine store is never empty." Perhaps he was referring to his own wine cellar, not the official store of the Song Dynasty. As for what the "wine store" in Fujian refers to, it is ultimately unknown.</p>
