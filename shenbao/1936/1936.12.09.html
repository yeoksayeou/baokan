<h3 id="c42">蘇聯新憲法的實行 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>含有濃厚民主色彩的蘇聯新憲法已於五日由第八屆全蘇大會修正通過加卽日實行了這新憲法的內容不但與以前的大不相同而且更表現出蘇聯社會建設的成功原來蘇聯的現行憲法是在革命後的環境下製成的而這十餘年來因爲社會建設的勝利環境已經完全不同因此舊憲法已不適用於是在去年一月底舉行的第七屆蘇聯大會中就提出修改聯邦憲法的提案通過後卽推定斯丹林等三十人組成憲法修改委員會從事修改憲法經一年餘的工作於今年五月完成而於六月十二日公布草案微求各方面的批評上月底又召集第八屆蘇聯大會討論草案經過若干的修正就於五日全部通過而卽日付諸實行了。</p>
<p>新憲法的特點是很多的其最重要的第一是民主化的傾向法國著名文學家羅曼羅蘭曾經說過「蘇聯的新憲法足以表明民主政治意義之廣此種新憲法的成立更顯示自由平等的眞義」最能表現民主主義的傾向的是新憲法規定各級蘇維埃的代表都由選民依照普遍的平等的直接的和秘密的投票法選舉出來這樣澈底的民主色彩在任何民主國家中也找不出來這種澈底民主化選舉法的採用把以前許多對於人民的選舉限制親定都一筆勾銷而使選舉權的範圍擴大起來這不能不說是蘇聯社會建設的成功。</p>
<p>其决是關於私人資產的規定蘇聯自從採行新經濟政策後就允許私人資本的存在這决新憲法更明文規定私產的法律保護憲草中關於公民個人財產繼承權本沒有規定這决大會中則予以修正規定繼承權受法律的保護這樣一來新憲法對於私人經濟的保護是更明顯了不過我們要認淸的這種私經濟是以「基於個人勞動而不剝削他人勞動爲限」的。</p>
<p>再决是關於宣布戰爭的規定新憲法第四十九條規定「蘇聯最高議院休會期內如蘇聯遭受武力攻擊或遇有執行國際互助抵抗侵略條約義務之必要時由主席團宣布戰爭」這條文中的第三句是憲草中所沒有而在這决大會中加添上去的因爲法蘇互助協定締訂以後卽使蘇聯本國不遭受武力攻擊而法國遭受未挑戰的攻擊時蘇聯也負有宣戰的義務這條約規定顯然是對付德日等向外侵略的國家的。</p>
<p>此外蘇聯新憲法的特點當然根多這裏不及列舉總之這决新憲法的製成實是近十餘年來蘇聯社會建設成功的果實這種民主化新憲法的實行不但對內含有重大的意義而且在對外方面也有很大的作用因爲在這法西斯勢力瀰漫的世界中民主政治已成强弩之末而現在却新添這樣一支生力軍這於世界和平的維持實有極大的貢獻而且蘇聯這决憲法的修正使其同英法美三大民主國家更易接近起來形成民主國的大同盟以應付國際法西斯主幾的侵略行爲這於國際政局的影響也是非常重大的。</p>

<p>（倫敦）國王愛德華所主張之婚姻、雖爲內閣所不能贊成、但此事所引起之憲法危機、尙不致卽須國王出於遜位之一途、現在局勢仍有迥旋餘地、（七日字林西報專電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英皇友人大地主白朗洛勳爵昨夜在法國加納大旅館向新聞記者數十人、宣讀辛浦住夫人所發表之聲明書、旋將原稿交與在塲諸人、並鄭重聲稱、辛夫人並未接見任何訪客、該聲明書曾由辛夫人署名、但辛夫人並未到塲、其言曰、「在過去數週中、辛浦生夫人屢欲避免有損於英皇或其皇位之任何行動或建議、伊之態度、迄未改變、如伊卽此退出、而能解决問題、則伊願卽退出此種雙方不愉快而不能常處之局」云、此項聲明書突如其來、雖宮中人員聞之、亦爲驚訝、初不料辛夫人竟有此堅决之主張也、卽貝爾維德爾行宮英皇左右初亦未知、但此項聲明並不能終止目前之危機、不過爲辛夫人之一種個人意見而已、文中所云「如伊卽此退出、而可解决問題」一語、則殊堪注意、據個中人聲稱、辛夫人此舉純出於本人之决定、今唯英皇之舉動始可終止目前之局勢、其他步驟、無論若何重要、其功效均屬有限、惟辛夫人此舉已引起國會方面較有希望之空氣、一般入以爲此亦未始非困難中一條出路、其他方面則以爲此舉或將促使時局急轉直下云、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（紐約）護送辛柏生夫人赴法之勃朗洛勳爵、今日在法國加納與美社訪員在電話中談話、謂「辛夫人所發表之聲明、表示夫人退出之後、如可使目前之困難完全解决、則夫人决立卽退出、故夫人之態度已明、現在夫人非常困憊、不願他人煩擾」云、勃氏不允表示辛夫人之聲明、是否卽爲實際上業已退出之意、惟稱、一切當由英王决定、記者復詢英王遜位與吾、對於夫人之計劃有何關係、勃氏謂夫人並未與彼論及此事、記者再問、「彼倆將於何時結婚、」爵士云、「奇哉此問、予何得而知之耶、」（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國官塲人士今日宣稱、勃朗洛爵士在法國加納、代辛柏生夫人所發表之聲明書、定係奉英王意志而行、由此可見英王或已决定此時暫不結婚云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>法國加納　美聯社今日自可靠方面得悉、辛柏生夫人所發表之聲明書、某措辭實係倫敦某方由無綫電話授意、（八日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）一般人對於今晨由克勞敦飛行塲前往法國加納神秘飛機、頗多揣測、該機因天氣惡劣、在法境勒蒲石飛機塲停留的一小時許、嗣見風雨一時無停止之望、遂於加油後、繼續起飛、聞該機乘客共爲男子三人、另有一說則謂此三人係英內務部人員、該機預定降落添油之里昂飛行塲、有憲兵一隊警衛、一切閒人皆不准行近該塲（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）新聞紀事報今日對辛柏生夫人之聲明、發表評論稱、『國王個人放棄婚姻之路、今已爲其愛人一言而廓淸矣、伊能爲者、彼亦能爲之、且其職責所在也』云、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>鮑爾溫今晨又與各閣員作非正式之談話、惟在英皇作最後决定之前、似不致有何重大發展、本日近午時、鮑氏尙無在下院發表宣言之徵象、同時外相艾登亦因此事、已决定不出席星期四日在日內瓦召集之國聯行政院會議、英國方面將有外交决官克萊邦子爵爲代表、聚集各衝要地點之民衆、已見今日來往之重要人物、不及往日之衆多、的克公爵夫婦今晨返抵披加狄雷寓邸、英皇幼弟坎特公爵則於今日下午乘黑白色之轎車疾馳比爾維特行宮云、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>—籌設國貨聯營公司</p>
<p>在很艱苦的熱烈的推行國貨運動中，最近來我們的國貨前途，是有了個新的開展。</p>
<p>這個新的開展，那就是最近南京國民經濟建設運動委員會，集合政府銀行和中華國貨產銷協會，進行籌設全國性的國貨聯營公司，資本二百萬元，日前並由滬上國貨鉅子晋京，向吳實長洽商，繼即由該會發表籌委三十九人，積極進行籌辦，道是奠定我國國民經濟建設的基礎，振興民族工業的初步而它在當前的意義，更是表示出政府維護國產的决心，和年來國貨界辛苦經營的收穫！</p>
<p>本來，因爲近幾年來全國國貨運動的勃興，促進了一般實業界的自覺，他們都紛紛從事國貨事業的開拓，不僅國貨工廠的增多，而各地的國貨公司，國貨商店，國貨商塲等，更也像風起雲湧地成立起來，然而，牠唯一的缺陷，那就在因爲沒有一個總的全國性的國貨銷售總機關，能够去有計劃有程序地去統馭他們，改進和擴大他們，所以，現在政府與全國實業界携手，創設這個聯營公司，正是要克服以往散漫，和各自爲政的現象，使國貨前途，有新的開展，促進國家管理全國產銷的主要工作。</p>
<p>雖然，在這時候，我們還要希望國貨界自身的努力，改進出品和增加生產數量，希望政府切實獎勵推銷國貨者，减低運費和稅捐。使國貨更　暢銷，這在實施全國各地國貨產銷網的過程中，更是重要的先决條件。</p>
<p>總之，過去我們國貨運動的中心，是往往在注意空洞的文字和口頭的宣傳上，現在却已進一步努力實際如何確立全國有計劃有糾織的產銷機關的成立，這一種進取的統盤規劃的精神，更反映出我們國貨的前途，是有了新的開展，我們一定要繼續着這種精神，益自勵進，造成更偉大的光榮的國貨前途！</p>
<h3 id="c139">國貨界與工業同業公會法 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>最近實業部已草定同業公會法三種，一曰商業同業公會法，一日工業同業公會法，一曰輸出業同業公會法。經五六月之研討，十餘决之會議，始得脫稿，呈請行政院咨送立法院通過。我國工商同業公會法之周密，與訂立之審愼，當以此次爲最。吾國貨界年來所感受之痛苦，有如下述：</p>
<p>（一）爲同業之無謂競爭，互相殘殺。</p>
<p>（二）爲各廠對於一切原料採集，製造技術，與夫推銷方式，各自爲政，不相聯絡。</p>
<p>（三）同業間之組織，往往呈散漫複雜之狀態，甚至疊床架屋，旁生枝節，失却統制之機能。</p>
<p>（四）同業間以平日之不相聯絡，缺乏業務上之研究，技術上之指導，以及一切統計調査，均付缺如，同業之盈虛消長，不易明晣。</p>
<p>此次工業同業公會法草案，卽針對此項弊病而訂立。力謀工業之改良發展，矯正已往之缺點，處處以合作爲主旨，如原料材料之共同購入，倉庫運輸之合作辦理，均屬工業界今後發展業務之要素。希望國貨界各就實業部所定草案，切實研究，各以經騐所及。儘量陳述，以供政府之參考。蓋立法是一事，事實是一事，法理與事實。能否適應，能否行之而不生困難，俱有待於經騐上之推敲，我工業界與此關係最切，自當急起注意也。</p>

<p>請到一九三期本刊，欣幸上海婦女服用國貨會，早在十一月十一日正式誕生了。婦女界是消費的主宰者，尤其家庭中的主婦，獨握家庭消費支配的權柄，這種提綱挈領的組織，其效力的偉大，當然不可限量。希望入會會員，都能採納兪玉樹先生的貢獻，身體力行，不掛虛名，在交際塲所　會客時間，從事普遍的宣傳，以謀組織的擴大，豈但國貨廠商得到助力，國家經濟命脈，必可挽回不少。</p>
<p>竊以此會的成立？要擇十一月十一日，從事的人，常然下了一番研究，包含着極深廣的意義的，我們不可不加認識，國貨卽是土貨，這是誰都知道的，十一兩個字疊寫，恰是一個土字，十一月十一日，就是「土」「土」，寓有希望入會會員，購買服用貨品的時候，不要忘記「土」貨，希望國貨工廠，購辦原料的時候，先揀「土」貨採辦的兩重重大的意義。好吧，無論是會員非會員，大家牢記着十一月十一日，大家別忘記土產土貨，那麽國貨自然發達，漏巵可以塞住，才不負此會成立的吉日良辰。</p>

<p>— 寅生</p>
<p>朔風已起，寒氣襲人，火爐實家庭中之恩物，中產以上，皆所必備，現在市上火爐，以何者爲最佳，最合於吾人理想中之條件，此亦冬令來臨之際，所必應具之常識也。</p>
<p>最近有廉潔火爐·出現市塲，實可除舊爐之弊，而革舊爐之命，其與舊式爐絕不相同者有數端：</p>
<p>（一）爐門只有一個，—因不須添煤，不須鈎灰，故無須多門，只一氣門已够，生火之後，即此氣門，亦緊閉不開，故終日無烟無灰，室內自然乾凈。（舊式之門或三或四，時時須開，烟灰瀰漫，討厭極矣）</p>
<p>（二）烟通較小—普通火爐，所燒之煤，以養氣不够，大部化爲烟炭，散於空中，則空氣爲之惡濁，積於管中，則烟通爲之淤塞，故烟通非大不可，廉潔爐所用煤品，出自特製，全部皆燃燒凈盡，故絕少烟炱，烟通無須過大，熱力因之不外洩，乃能收省煤省費之效。</p>
<p>（三）特製煤晶—煤晶之優點（甲）一天只用一個，燒後餘燼不碎，仍是整塊，一倒便去，（丙）淸潔，無灰無烟，上巳言之不贅，（丁）煤晶大小三種，欲增熱度，可用大號，欲求經濟，可用中小兩號，悉聽其便，極富彈性，（戊）佔地不多，煤晶大小如一，可以疊置牆角，只二三尺足矣，不如散煤，用量多，佔地大，狼籍滿地也。</p>
<p>（四）可以兩用，—機關或大戶人家，有終日終年，燒煤爐於廚房，以取開水，或煮菜者，如改用此爐，費用不加，而方便多矣。</p>
<p>（五）熱力平均—普通火爐，加煤時，熱度驟降，發火時，熱度太高，以冷熱不均，常致喉痛，或感冒傷風，小兒允易罹疾，廉潔爐，以用煤晶故，一天到晚熱度一律，决無忽高忽低之弊，有益衛生，所關允大。</p>
<p>其他如爐式之雅，價格之廉，尙其餘事，聞此爐係中央大學某敎授，參考外國最新式火爐，更出心裁，幾經改良，始出問世，不日即可應市矣。</p>

<p>— 本報特訊　胡祖蔭調查</p>
<p>二十四年起，學校醫務處特設免費砂眼治療所三處，每週開診十次；每校學生每週可輪流診治二次。寒暑假期內，更將診治砂眼决數增多，可使患砂跟學生多來醫治。綜計去年一年中，五所華童小學學生息輕重砂跟者有一千五百九十八人。全年中診治决數有二萬四于一百四十六决。完全治愈學生有二百七十二人。病狀漸見减輕，堪以滿意者有一百七十九人。一度病愈而重經檢査者有二百五十人。治愈後而重患砂眼者有七十二人；重患砂眼的原因是由於家庭中不重公共衛生所致。</p>
<p>對於已患傳染病，重病，或其他輕微疾病學生，學校醫務處除通知其家長醫治外，並派學校看護婦分赴患病學生家中探望，藉以明瞭學生家長是否已爲兒童醫治疾病。此種探望工作頗有價値；一方面可以明瞭學生在家醫治疾病的狀况，一方面可以勸導和督促家長注重並實行維護兒童健康的工作。現將學校看護婦探望學生家庭的紀錄列表說明，亦可看出此種工作價値的一斑。</p>
<p>第一次探望學生家庭　二五二三人</p>
<p>學生家長已進行各種醫治工作者　一〇七五人</p>
<p>學生家畏未有舉動者　一四四八人</p>
<p>第二次探望學生家庭　二三九五人</p>
<p>學生家長已進行各種醫治工作者　一四二五人</p>
<p>學生家長未有舉動者　九七〇人</p>
<p>第三次探望學生家庭　一九五七人</p>
<p>學生家長已進行各種醫治工作者　一二六八人</p>
<p>學生家長未有舉動者　六八九人</p>
<p>假期內特別探望學生家庭　四五八人</p>
<p>學生家長已進行各種醫治工作者　四〇一人</p>
<p>學生家長未有舉動者　五七人</p>
<p>綜觀上表，可以看出家長對於兒童疾病未有舉動的傾同已經逐漸减少；這也可以證明，因爲學校看護婦探望學生家庭的結果，學生家長對於在學兒童的健康業經重視。</p>
<p>十三·家庭聯絡</p>
<p>工部局小學平時歡迎家長來校談話。每學期中，各校舉行分級招待家長談話會，由各校敎帥輪流招待各級家長來校談話。在此種談話中，敎師與家長可以很開誠地交換關於兒童的個性，生理的心理的狀况以及敎養兒童的各種意見。敎師並可乘此時機將兒童平時的作業成績和十週測騐成績交與家長閱看，可使家長明瞭兒童在學校中的學業狀况。據學校當局的意見，此種分級招待家長談話會對於學校與家庭的溝通和聯絡很有重大的帮助。</p>

<p>鐵血宰相俾士麥一朝躍登相位，便盡力的發揮權力，推行他的獨特的主張。直到德國振作了爲止。當時他曾經對民衆代表說道：一目前的各種問題，只有用鐵和血來才能解决」·　吾們四萬萬七千萬孤苦無吿的人民，被壓在無窮量的國家危難底下，也該異口同聲的下起最大的决心，向着自己的靈魂說道：「目前的各種問題，只有用鐵和血來才能解决」。</p>
<p>倘若這能有眞實表現的話，眼看將在十年以後，吾們老大的中國，也得返老還童，和俾士麥再造下的德國一樣，日漸强盛，成爲一個世界上眞正的一等强國。於是睡獅是醒了，死豬這話眞是不確的。（明心）</p>
<h3 id="c195">不會落淚的女人 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>誰說女人善哭？這話，我就不信。請以我最近所見的三事爲證　第一事，請先述我的同居的李夫人。李夫人，已結婚了七年，而且已是二個孩子的母親了，李先生待伊，也不惡，夫婦的感情，也相當的和好。但最近，李夫人忽然和伊的一位在某　銀行中任科長而新喪偶的表兄愛上了，乃突的向李先生提出離婚的要求。這在李先生，不啻是一個晴天的霹靈，直氣得病倒了。病在牀上，還是每天的淌眼抹淚，但李夫人，却元是逼着伊寫休書，幷不住的恫嚇着。李先生給纏不過，於是只得咬着牙，滴着淚而屈服了。李夫人，便當晚的懷着休書走了。當伊臨走時，三歲的那孩子，是睡着，五歲的那孩子，牽着伊的衣角不放，但伊却終於把手推開了孩子，走了。</p>
<p>第二事，是我的表弟死了。在尙未成殮時，我的表弟婦，却聚精會神的，向伊六十餘歲的翁姑，逼着要一萬元的贍養費。伊振振有詞的，向在塲的親友，訴說着伊的翁姑的不慈，平日的如何冷漠。如今丈夫死了，來日將不堪設想，所以乘着親友們在塲，提出這要求，免得將來發生糾紛。伊的翁姑，痛子之喪，再加着伊的喧擾，直氣得老淚續橫，不能自已。但伊却毫無淚痕，倒反而越說越有勁，終我表弟之喪，就只聽得伊呶呶不休，沒見伊滴過一點淚</p>
<p>還有一件，是我們弄裏的那個所謂阿更嫂。阿更，是一個泥水匠，在二月之前，從屋面上跌下來，當時倒沒傷，後來忽然吐血了。吐血了不上十天，便死了。阿更死了，阿更嫂不哭，倒反樂了，說的跟這窮鬼，是一世不能出頭的。過了一星期，伊的，四歲的女見，忽然失踪了。女兒失踪了，伊不哭，也不找，反而更樂了，說的這麽着，倒淸爽。又過了半月，伊是找得了對手，歡天喜地的搬家了。</p>
<p>誰說女人善哭？這三位，便是我親見的不哭的女人。雖然伊們都是臨到了男子都忍不往要落淚的事件，但是我敢設誓，伊們三個，是絕對的不曾打動過鐵石心腸的。人非木石，孰能無情？然而天下竟有掉在可悲的環境中，而不哭的女子。嘿，眞是了不起。然而我總覺得似乎有些不近人情。</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>日前爲名導演但君　宇四十初度之辰，予往賀之，近來杜字倦於銀燈膠片生活，寓中蓄熱帶魚若干盎以日遺，盎底列雨花台文石，植立熱帶草若干莖，綠色湛然，魚遊泳其問，令人對之如置身濠梁之上，以神仙魚爲最美，體扁而鰭長，緒有條紋，色采可喜，據云：是魚能食蒼蠅，惜未目覩，杜宇固善油畫，寫生張璧，爲狀乃絕肖，有玻璃魚，遍體透明，可見臟腑，有麗麗魚，尾作淺紫色，鳴聲似靑蛙，允爲特殊之品，鬥魚性好鬥爭，以祇一尾故，不能爲敵對行動，杜宇乃驅之至盎邊，示以明鏡，魚見鏡中之幻影，奮緒張吻，有殺敵致果之概，而體色變化，倐而碧，倐而頳，如虹如綺，如蜀錦乍展，如奇花初胎，母怪暹羅人士以鬥魚之戲爲唯一娛樂也。觀賞移時，杜宇復以美酒見餉，飲之其味紳厚，絕無喉乾口燥之弊，詢之，則曰：此我黔之名釀茅台酒也。酒產於懷仁縣茅台村，以運輸困難，捐稅奇重，不易出省，十六年春，族兄懋辛由彼方帶來數罌，飲之芳留齒頰，數日不去，此後每獲佳餚，輒思名釀，不　嘗者十年於茲矣，某日，偶經三馬路某舖，見有寄售茅台酒之禍櫫，奈以阮囊羞澀，未能購致以歸，而事有巧合者，一昨某書局主人見訪，屬畫封面二幅，得酬二十金，常卽市得五瓶，蓋每瓶値四金，厥數恰相當也。十年相思，一朝償願，其快慰也何如，願與君等盡通宵之歡，時同席者，爲蔣子梅康，莊子國鈞，及其姪曾孫但二春，夫人殷明珠女士，都爲之酡然半醉云。</p>
<h3 id="c197">白蘆紅蓼和野鴨之陣 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 德鄰</p>
<p>白的蘆花，紅的蓼花，點綴了初冬的景色，在太湖之邊，洞庭之濱，還有那成千成萬的野鴨陣，好像落葉般的鼓了翅膀，頭那麼昂昂地順着風向，在湖光山色間，織成了一副浩浩蕩蕩的壯麗畫面，如其你身歷太湖的洞庭導處一眼望去，少不掉會使你飄飄然憧憬羽化，但它們永遠會這樣悠然逍遙嗎，不，人類正需要把它們當做應時的美肴了，在這個時候，在太湖裏，不是頻添了許多的艒艒船，在鼓槳來往追着野鴨之陣；運用了熟練的手術，把獵槍瞄準，一彈書然，那一隻隻的野鴨，便應聲而落；落在一叢叢的蘆葦裏，落在湖心的水面上，當你從野味店裏買回來嘗試着這「太湖野珍」，吃的你正高興的當兒；常常會使你發現了彈屑在它身上，這獵槍打鴨的技巧，是洞庭水鄉漁人獨得之秘；任憑你是使槍的能手，任憑你有射擊的妙技；到太湖之濱去嘗試着，竟會使你失望了打不到一隻，漁人們祗要瞄準了，却會百發百中地彈不漏空，手法非常的熟練靈敏。</p>
<p>野鴨捕從的方法，除掉了槍，還可以用「天羅網」去捕捉，漁人划了船，划到野鴨最多的所在，運用了渾身的勁兒，把偌大的「天羅網」扯起，這個網籠罩了天空，向湖心一個磕撲，那些野鴨被張羅了便無法逃避，活活地都被捉住，你走過野味店的門前，不但可以說到有死野鴨一簇簇地掛着，並且在鐵絲籠裏，不是還有着活野鴨的鬧着擁擠和客滿的盛况呢？</p>
<p>在黃昏時候，野味店野鴨兩字的霓紅燈，誘惑了每個過路人的視覺，和每個過路人的食慾。在初冬新寒的天氣，嘗了野鴨味兒的富人們，並且睡了那軟綿綿的野鴨絨褥子，質地那麼輕鬆柔軟，價錢非常高貴，怪舒適的牛活，但是那今朝還在湖光山色間的天空，逍遙飛翔的野鴨，明朝已經被人類寢其毛而食其肉了，觸目鷹心的野鴨呀！富人們不要步了它的後塵。</p>

<p>友梅看到他這分主意的樣子，故意先鎭定了一下，把茶杯放到茶几上，從容的坐，微笑道：表哥和夢蘭通信以來，還不知道他的身世嗎？國器道：我在信上，怎麽能够問人家的身世？友梅點點頭，默然的坐着。國器的臉上，倒有點透出來紅暈了，自己也不解何故，心裏已是有些跳躍。便道：剛才李女士說，他自小就套上了一把銷鍊，這話怎說？友梅道：論起來我是不應當吿訴你的。這也並非是他的什麼陰私，不應當吿訴你。只是吿訴你以後，你心裏頭更會加上一層煩惱的。國器聽說，臉色是更透着頽喪一些。點點頭道：這也無所謂。我老早也就知道，他是一個傷心人。友梅道：我實對表哥說，在他的眼裏，大概只有我，還可以算他牛個知己，聊可談心。此外，他自己認爲這一輩子，我不出一個好伴侶了。所以如此，就是幼年間，父母給　加上了一道鎖鍊的緣故。表哥現在心裏頭明白了嗎？國器道那麽，是他父母，已經將　與別人指腹爲婚了。這是中國社會上一種極惡劣的風俗，不想輪到他頭上，不幸得很，義畢，嘆了一口氣。友梅道：雖不是指腹爲婚，但那訂婚的日子，他年歲是很小的，他是一個世家，很不容易打被舊習慣。他不願意爲了他一個人的事情，讓全家的人不痛快，而他又是知進現代女子，是應當怎樣做人的。在新舊思想衝突之下，他是非常的苦惱。我們做朋友的也沒有法了給他拿主意。說到這裏，友梅把　調壓了一壓，又向門簾子外看了一看，意思是怕讓章老太太聽到了。才接着道：他萬般無奈，才是到書本上我法干消遣。不料表哥的文字，很合他的脾胃，又不想全住在南京城這一個角落一裏……說句迷信的話，也許這是造化小兒故意弄人。我在旁邊看到，是很替他可憐，願在相常的範國以內和他帮點忙的。他說到這裏，又停頓住了，昂頭想了一想，向國器微笑道：對不住我嘴笨得很，有多話是需要我說的，我全說不出來。不過、哥那　有學問的人，用不着我說什麽，你也會明白，我完全是好意。（一〇八）</p>

<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>自從從綏東匪亂爆發以來，國人對國防警衛，已極度的注目。除盡力爲護國健兒，作切實的後援之外，我們對於內蒙古的現狀，應有深刻的認識。</p>
<p>內蒙古在元朝末葉，還不脫遊牧狀態，政治組織，到淸初才確定。淸庭統一蒙古諸王族，改爲盟旗制度。常時以沙漠爲界，漠北稱外蒙古，漠南爲內蒙古。內蒙古計二十四部落四十九旗，成爲六盟。內中三盟如　里木，卓索圖，照烏達等十四部落二十六旗，九一八事變後，被劃在所謂一王道樂土一之內。現在發生叛亂的，乃是錫林郭勒，伊克昭，烏蘭察布三盟、十部落，二十三旗）的一部份。所謂旗者和各省的縣份相等，是行政區的單位，集多數旗而成盟。旗有旗長稱　薩克，盟有盟長及副盟長，行政權採用協講制度。近年以來，世襲的札蘇克，已漸採用選舉制了。民國十七年，正式改爲熱河，察哈爾，綏遠二省。各地亦和內地相同，有縣長及警察兵士等，於是一變其遊牧狀態了。</p>
<p>內蒙古氣候較寒，冬季在零下四十餘度，春秋各一月，夏季兩月，其餘均是冬季氣候了、。土地除南方以外，不宜種植，日畜牧極盛，遍　都是牧草，决不像我們理想的荒凉。內外蒙古人口，大的爲五百萬，外蒙古只有一百萬，內蒙古三省之中，計四百萬，如歸化，包頭一帶，已和內地一樣的熱鬧。漢蒙兩種，和愛不分彼此了。那裏下流階級是一夫一妻制的，中流以上都是多妻制。大婦權力極大，處理家務，髮髻衣服都特殊，非妾婢所能效學。女子較男子爲勤儉，體格强健與男子相埒。</p>
<p>蒙人古來善戰，以射御名於世，七八歲的孩子，亦能騎裸馬馳騁沙塲。喇嘛廟會餘興的競馬和角力是蒙古有名的競技。蒙人信喇嘛極虔誠，醫藥，祈禳，人事調解，非喇嘛不可。家有男子兩三人，必出一人爲喇嘛，故佔全人口三分之一以上。日人注意內蒙非自今日始，滿蒙常聯爲一體。東京有滿蒙學校，授滿蒙文於日人以爲深人內蒙之用。人丹說明書中，有滿蒙文之翻譯，卽可證明日本對蒙文之研究，殊覺可驚。我國內地，習東西文者不尠，而能滿蒙文者，眞是絕無僅有的。</p>
<p>最近日人又在興安嶺山麓的王爺廟，開設了興安軍官學校。專收內蒙的靑年，施以純日本的軍事教育，以恢復成吉思汗雄圖爲號召。訓練之後，便派往內蒙的土着軍隊裏去趕特務工作，此種誘導人家自相殘殺，以求從中取利，是他們始終不變的方針。我們平日高呼保全國土完整的，現在遇到內蒙國防綫的襲擊，應一致作後援，以驅除被人利用的醜類。</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働醫科大學畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>……在歐美各國對於治療淋病已採用霸烈的透膜殺菌方法　……最新可靠的療療法是以溫文有效的剿撫兼施政策根除淋菌</p>
<p>中國由科學的落後，醫學永遠停滯在半途上不能前進。歐洲的許多新奇的醫藥發明，在中國有時竟會全不知道這回事。這雖然症結在於醫藥不發達，但民眾一般文化水準的低落也，實在是一個重大的原因。</p>
<p>像淋病這樣的疾患，在中國還是成為醫學上一個難以解決的問題，可是歐美各國，早已認為好像傷風一流的病癥。淋病難治的說法，已經是過去歷史上的名詞了。淋病的難關早已打破！</p>
<p>原來自從淋病學家Rudolr　M.D博士利用了蛋白體治療淋病後，患淋病的男女，其比率一天天的降低。淋菌的足跡，已逐步減少，深信不久的將來在西半球可以說不會再有淋病的傳播了。</p>
<p>博士經過多次研究，證明蛋白體若摻入那帶有副作用的黃色素裏面，則黃色素因受了蛋白體的混和，便會發生化學作用而消失其毒性。成為性質和平的物質。因為黃色素的質料粗劣，從前拿黃色素作為內服藥，以撲滅淋菌（即尿道的透膜殺菌療法），往往流弊很大，常令病人服後損害胃腸或腎臟。所以歐洲早已不用這種療法。但黃色素實際功效，確有尿道消炎的能力。那末黃色素還是採用好呢？不用它好呢？這問題一直鬧了很久，直到Rudolr博士才把它解決了，就是證實黃色素如果配合蛋白體，就不會有任何副作用。而蛋白體的特效，卻能使患者的血液中產生多量血球及抗淋素，以撲滅淋菌，這方法又經畢道博士進一步的把二者合制為內服聖藥「克淋儂」。當初雖經多次失敗，卒有今日之成功。『克淋儂』的治淋功效是鐵硬的，有力的。但卻沒有副作用，所以又是王道的，軟性的。本劑凡男女急慢性淋濁，攝護腺炎睪丸炎膀胱及婦女白帶，服後即能迅速斷根，如果兼用『抗淋水』依說明書插圖及用法在家洗滌尿道，尤有特效！『克淋儂』內含蛋白體，凡不含蛋白體之合製淋劑，概係混充偽藥，購時認明『克淋儂』三字</p>

<p>……如能積極施以青春線內分泌治療　……則一切惡化的癥象保證一掃而光</p>
<p>文豪巴耐得盛氏說過：『二十世紀是人類神經衰弱症最猖獗的時代。』的確，這是否人不能否認的事實。</p>
<p>現代文明的進步，腦力精神的運用愈為繁複，在這種情況之下，本症的猖獗，為必然的事。同時，醫學界對於本症治療的貢獻，也能隨時代而進展，因此之故，任憑神經衰弱症怎樣劇烈，怎樣廣泛，做工程師的總能保證患者不致絕望，而且能在效果確實的原則下，迅速撲滅！</p>
<p>耳鳴，頭痛，失眠，健忘，及肢體酸軟，精力疲憊。這几種神經衰弱症，比較地患者較多，危害吾人的健康，也比較地劇烈。大凡先天不足，與強度刺激之後，極易亢奮末梢神經，每因此而陷於神經衰弱。此外青年之荒淫無度，及發育時耽溺於過度的手淫者，更易促成本症。關於本症的撲滅對策，以服青春線內分泌製劑『補體康』為最佳，它確具卓絕的效果。假使我們不幸發生了本症，就該早期利用『補體康』以挽救之，自己必須要抱定堅決的信仰,以便充實我們的內分泌，及促進體內各細胞新陳代謝！患者諸君可以毋庸焦燥！『補體康』所含的成分，是非常週密，盈千累萬的服者，幾乎均有絕佳的印象。</p>

<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>……治肺不離乎肺！　……豈可捨本逐末？</p>
<p>肺病的療法，古今來不知道經過多少演變，費盡多少學者的心血，結果幾乎全是失敗。比方是增加病灶的結締細胞吧，他的理論雖然很對，但是一般都想從鈣劑的內服，使患者產生石灰質，而達到結締細胞生成的目的。這是異常愚笨的方法。其實也很不容易收到實效。</p>
<p>此外，又有人想增進患者的體力，使身體抵抗力強健起來，而達到撲滅癆的治效。這說法更是淺薄得可笑呢！真要這麼講起來，世界上的疾患，只須吃幾服補藥就行了，醫藥兩字根本就談不到。</p>
<p>最新的如臟器療法，其實也只是駕雲梯取月，因為病根在肺，治肺當然不離乎肺，怎麼可以離開題目做文章呢？所以臟器療法雖會一度風行於歐洲，但不久就早歸消聲匿跡了！</p>
<p>今日最新的肺病療法，是注重於肺部馳緩療法的。這就是現在各國醫院中所盛行的肺部外科術如氣胸，胸廊形成術等，但是這些方法只限於外科，尚嫌不能普遍。憑籍了科學的萬能，於是把這個手法應用於內服藥的治療上，遂發明了最新的「補肺拿爾」一藥。本藥完全作用於肺部，使患側肺馳緩，而得病灶與空洞收縮，因而咯血口咳痰，咳嗽胸痛，都能於服後逐步消失，并且潮熱清退，盜汗停止，肺癆得以全部根治，永不再發。不過兼患神經衰弱失眠遺精和婦女朋經不調的癆病人，可同時兼服男用「補體康」以治遺精或女用「補女容」以調經，即有良效！</p>

<p>月經為一般女子必降臨之物，然因月經而痛，則是於一般不健全之女性。僅在彼身體上出現種種病癥，而其精神上更覺無上之苦悶，有往往因此而成歇斯的里病者。在臨床的實騐上，更不乏其例、</p>
<p>考女子月經病之成因，不外卵巢機能失常，以及其他之內分泌腺發生障礙之故。故欲防止月經病之再發，須先設法將此等病態矯正之。蓋卵巢與諸內分泌機能之失態，不僅發生月經病，且每發生月經病以外之疾患。如不感症，及不孕等症是也。據餘歷來所用之調經藥，以「補女容」為調經藥中之正宗。因「補女容」，為合女用內分泌等之製劑，。對於卵巢之失常，與其他內分泌機能之障礙。服之均能在根本上予以矯正。故功效迅速而正確也。例如住大林路之丁太平君夫人，成婚已五六年，而恒苦月事不調，從未受姙一次。中西調經催孕之藥，嘗試殆遍。嗣乃來餘所治療，經用科學方法檢查後，始知卵巢機能減弱，大有停止傾向。乃投以「補婦容」未兩月而經漸準。一年後月經忽又停止，知己受孕矣。惟丁夫人平日又有白帶，亦經余用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥。以滌除白帶，在三星期中已告全瘳矣。</p>

<p>因為是早慧而早熟的人，在十三四歲的時候，被一位比我年齡大幾歲的朋友，給我一部類於性史的淫書看，竟使我著了迷；於是我就極力搜求關於這類的書籍。</p>
<p>從此一來，我對於教科書就覺得非常枯燥無味，讀了幾行，便要頭重眼花。這是什麼原因呢？事實是這樣的：因為我自受了邪書的影響，無意中就惹起手淫，此後遂無虛夕，由此遺精，早洩，性器官發育不全的症狀，紛然並作，廣集一身。</p>
<p>此外頭痛眼花，記憶力衰退，心悸亢進等，也跟蹤而來。以致面貌瘦削，形同癆病鬼，那時我會拍下一照，現在還在，（隨函送上）你瞧，瘦得是多麼難看啊！那時的我，運動久了也要滑精，身體還覺得疲勞。有時體面發熱，假使坐在凳上，精液會漸漸滑出，走路也無力氣，視力障礙（眼脹），口乾燥，大便不通，肌瘦無血。夜間如稍用腦，就睡不著。</p>
<p>但是今年六月裏，承蒙陳醫師的指示四我每日進服「補體康」九粒到十二粒。這樣吞服了二個多月，已把上面的症候完全治好了。記憶增加，思想敏捷，面亦豐腴，皮膚白嫩。反比前數年要年青得多。因此我今天又拍了一幀小照，以留紀念（隨函一併送上）</p>

<p>誤認痔疾之淋病</p>
<p>診斷本是一件不容易之事，往往與其他疾患相混。尤其是淋病如此。如不實行詳細正確之診斷，恒難鑑別。如痔疾本為肛門部分之疾患，原與淋疾毫不相干，但有許多淋病患者，多不自知其病之變化，本為淋症之續發症，而誤以為是痔疾，實則直腸淋也。此症多起於淋病分泌液沾染肛門的粘膜，或由攝護腺炎，精囊膿瘍，更有大便時在廁所傳染者，其症狀為肛門周圍發赤，流黃色膿液，後來往往有出血，糜爛。故最易傳染妻子，肛門由潰爛而狹窄，竟至不能大便，積垢愈多，淋菌愈眾，所生之危險愈大。若醫治不得其法，則肛門愈後，多留硬結，致失去肛門之伸縮性而成肛門狹窄。</p>
<p>此等症狀，病家每不注意，故多由痔疾專家介紹余處治療，如住海寗路陸叔雲君，據訴：前雖染淋病，但已告愈，未幾忽又發生痔疾，歷經醫治，而未收效。後經痔科朱醫師診斷，始知淋病，故介紹余處治療云。乃為之用「抗淋水」洗滌及和電療後，同時更進服德國「克淋儂」，以消炎鎮痛防腐，五星期後。即獲全愈。大小便通暢如恒。其夫人亦染淋毒性白帶，腔道糜爛，亦囑其外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，內仍服「克淋儂」亦未五星期，所患盡愈。嗣夫婦又用血清反覆檢騐十數次，交未有一次淋毒反應。此為確獲根治之證明，故偕居迄今，從未有病的變動云。</p>

<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>因性機能喪失而感覺煩惱的人們，實際上超過一般人意料之外。最悲慘者，莫如因手淫而引起的遺精症，原因由於遺精之後，生理上所產生的精液供過於求，結果不僅使生殖器的發育受阻，而且每因此促成早洩與陰萎，惹起極悲慘的性機能障礙症，使你永遠不能享到健康的幸福，抑有進者，結婚生活最甜蜜的一段，無法嘗試，等於鰥居無異，這不是人生大不幸嗎？</p>
<p>在國外最著名的性病學家，他們都說：遺精實為促成一切性病的階梯。所以一般性感的少年，絕對不可捲入自凟的漩渦，這是青年金科玉律。尤其有跨業的青年，應該早期施以有效的治療，切不可徬徨歧途！</p>
<p>治療本症，須適應體質與其癥狀的程度等，若積極的施以「耐而斯遺精片」治之，更呈顯著優良效果。現在我們隨便舉一個實例來看，便可明白一切了。——患者陶　文，年廿三歲，因過度手淫而遺精，結果爆發早洩，陰萎等性機能障礙症，遍服各藥，迄難根治，旋以施行「耐而斯遺精片」以治之。經過五星期，遺精即止，性能之健全，亦無比矣。</p>

<p>前日日本川越大全來滬，在日本申江俱樂部發表談話謂（一）綏遠之事，曾經日當局聲明，與日本無干，（二）中日國交前途，並不悲觀云云。惟綏遠之事，雖經日當局聲明，並無關係，但日本某軍事家，則曾有直認不辭的口吻，所謂事實勝於雄辯，我們現在且不去討論這個，至謂中日國交前途，並不悲觀，則我輩誠百思而不得其解。</p>
<p>日本川越大使赴京，與我國外交當局作調整國交之談判，為期已逾兩月，雙方正式談判，亦有八次之多，其餘兩國外交人員，作非正式之接洽者，更是不可勝數，但是結果毫無，雙方談判之機會，大有無形停頓之姿勢，故以後雙方談判，是否能繼續復開，此尚在猜疑而莫能斷定之問題也。</p>
<p>照這樣情形看來，是兩國間悲觀的形勢居多，而樂觀的形勢殊少，我不知川越大使從怎樣一種觀點上看出有不必悲觀的可能？夫悲觀與不悲觀，本來其權原操之於日方，並不在於我國，蓋日方茍放棄其大陸邁進政策，便可樂觀，假定日方不願放棄此種政策，則雖欲不悲觀而不得也，此次雙方談判，已愈兩月之久，而未獲圓滿之結果者，（一）大抵由於日方之慾望太奢，意氣太甚，只為自己著想，而半點不為人著想，（二）一方作正式外交談判，而另一方則用武力威脅，此種態度，完全錯誤，現在此種方法，非但不能適用，面對於國交談判方面，更發生一種不良的印象，故此次談判停頓之原因，綏遠事件，亦為其一。</p>
<p>其次日方所以抱定此種政策，而不肯改變者，其謬誤的原因，亦有兩種，（一）日方太覺迷信武力為萬病良方，以為有龐大的陸海軍實力，儘可何求不得，何願不從，（一）由於視察我國的錯誤，以為　是滿清時代，軍閥割據時代的中國，儘可威懾利誘，為所欲為，此種觀察，實　認識不足同，如近日發生之綏邊事件，則縱合匪偽蹂躪邊城，在青島則假工潮為名，使陸戰隊登陸，夫中日談判，既因綏事而發生影響，而青島事件，又復概繼續發生，可知日方始終未有半點覺悟之表示也，中日國交前途果能不悲觀乎？</p>
<h3 id="c213">「文學無用」和「文學亡國」 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 阿曇</p>
<p>凡是文人他們都歡喜強調文學的功用。好像杜介捏夫的獵人日記，促成俄羅斯的農奴解放，哥德的浪漫作品先導了狂飇運動。至於羅梭的民約論那更是民主主義的張本了。至於中國那就更不得了，「經天緯地之謂文」更把「文」字捧上了九天。</p>
<p>其實這種說法，在承平之時文人們互相私語是不要緊，一到天下有事那就不得了。因為那時候所謂文　有用只是「亡國亂族」，先舉一個古老的例子罷。</p>
<p>「金主亮頗知書，同柳耆卿西湖之作，欣然有慕於三秋桂子，十裡荷花，遂更投鞭渡江之志，乃密　　工，於奉使中寫臨安山水漫畫之像，　馬吳山第一峯之句」（徐雷　苑　　談）</p>
<p>據此，那末金邦屢犯中原，原因都起於柳老卿「西湖之作」。柳老以詞鳴於北寧，「今夜酒醒何處？楊柳岸曉風殘月」。傳誦一時，至「曉風殘月柳屯田」也。</p>
<p>柳又名柳三變，小詞皆為妓女歌姬所作，所以宛麗非常。袁綺云「柳七曉風殘月，謂可令十七少八女按紅牙檀板歌之」。以這樣一個人，以這樣的作品，而竟使敵國雄君「欣然起鞭渡江之志」，真非夷所思了。趙宋一代，金邦永為大患，岳少保拚死戰爭，還不能「還我河山」，而召寇之因，乃是柳耆卿的幾首小詞，這點有人自然以為當時大臣們的　詞，使「亡國」的責任令一個可憐的文人負之。然而我們就是知道，大臣偏如此說，有什麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>至於　時的例子，那末更多了，某將軍謂哥哥妹妹的文學可以亡國，就下令禁落葉；某　者竟說標點符號也是亡國原因了。</p>
<p>復次，文學亡國雖則有例可舉，而文學救國却不足為訓的，魯迅先生在一篇「文藝與政治的歧途中」，說「孫傳芳所以趕走，是革命家其砲轟掉的，決不是革命文藝家做幾句「孫傳芳呀，我們要趕掉你呀」！的文章趕掉的」這還有什麼話說呢？</p>
<p>周作人先生是最著名的，文學無用論主張，他在中國新文學的源流上說：「從前面我所說的許多話中，大家當可以看出文學是無用的東西，因為我們所說的文學，只是以達出作者的思想感情為滿足，此外，再無目的之可言。裏面沒有大鼓動的力量，也沒有教訓，只能令人聊以快意」。其實我與為與其如此說，不如說一切文學都是無用為妙。因為只有先說明了文學無用，才不致負亡國的罪名，不然即如周作人先生所說的「只是以達出作者的思想感情為滿足的，此外再無目的之可言」。的作品，像柳七的西湖之作，也會引起金主亮的「投鞭渡江之志」其它更有何說！</p>
<p>所以我在這裏高呼著「文學無用」！</p>
<h3 id="c214">瞎子 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 燕汀</p>
<p>連下了幾日雨，天氣聚然變得寒冷起來了。</p>
<p>我沒有出門去，妻從外面進來，說住在亭子間裏的那個瞎子，又在四鬧，摸索著四小虎子。聽了，我便開門出去</p>
<p>亭子間門微微的開著，從扶梯頭可以看清裏面凌亂地堆積著的，破床鋪，板凳，木檯子，飯鍋，煤油燈和馬桶。我推進門時，瞎子已從床上爬起來，邊用乾啞的嗓子，四：「小虎子，小虎子！」邊伸著兩只手在房裏像捉迷藏似的摸索著。</p>
<p>他底年紀怕也有三十二三了，個子出奇地高，滿口山東口腔，從前是跑江湖要把戲的，後來為著病，把兩只眼睛病瞎了。他搬進這兒來，是兩個月前的事，一家共有三個人，女人是一個廿六七年紀的小婦人，五年前據說還會使著一手好槍法，高個子瞎了眼，她就進廠去，嘴裏鑲著金牙，喜歡從眼角看人，另一個就是小虎子，七歲左右，一身油垢衣服，滿面黑油煙，為著一節煙蒂頭，或半個燒餅，他就常常在弄堂裏打拳頭，逗人家樂。</p>
<p>這瞎子，每天背著一個尺把長的長方木匣子，小虎子在前頭也背了一隻小板凳，牽導著上街去賣文王卦。那小婦人却不定什麼時候在家，有時她整天不在家，直到晚上一二點鍾才回來，有時連晚上也不回家。瞎子雖關心著她，可是却也不敢不相信她底話。</p>
<p>有時在晚上九點左右，我從外面回來，看他還坐在板凳上，像賣掛時兩腳排正著，背脊堅得筆直的，用竹棍子連接著在地下敲打，督促小虎子燒飯時，我禁不住總要在他底　前站站，而且低聲的問：</p>
<p>「嫂子還沒回來！」</p>
<p>「怕又上夜工去了，聽說紗價轉漲，廠裏忙著。……」他說著，又連忙去身上掏煙絲匣子，把六寸長的煙筒遞過來：「來一筒，洪先生。……」</p>
<p>我忙向他謙遜了兩句，又說了幾句閒話，便走開。</p>
<p>對於那小女人在整十二時的日工外還連接著做夜工的事，屋子裏的人頗多話說。瞎子不在家時，常有些不尷不尬的女人來走動，而常常在弄堂還有男人在等。這事實幾乎是全弄堂的人都知道了，可是那瞎子還被朦著，他鎮日生活在他底文王卦，等角和板凳之間。</p>
<p>我默默地在門邊站立著，瞎子霎了霎他底盲眼，才憤憤地咬住牙關，低聲罵道：「小虎子，我去臊你娘的！……」揚著兩隻拳頭，摸索過來，像要給他兩隻拳頭挨似的。我知道他弄錯了，忙說道：</p>
<p>「是我，陳先生。……」</p>
<p>他好像吃了一驚似的，忙站住，放下手中的拳頭，抱歉地說道：</p>
<p>「我以謂是小虎子，對不住！是你，洪先生……坐坐，小虎子娘昨晚上夜工，沒回來，屋子裏弄得亂七八糟，不嫌吧！……」說罷又很響的望床上一拍，意思想四我坐下。</p>
<p>我坐著，他也坐著，大家暫時都沉默了。</p>
<p>扶梯響著，小虎子推著門進來了，他底手和面孔，給外頭的風刮得紅紅的</p>
<p>「小虎子你到那兒去？害你爸找。……」我問。</p>
<p>小虎子沒有理我，他喘著氣朝他爸那邊過去。</p>
<p>「爸，媽我看到了，她在一間客店裏跟一個男人在一起，我想進去，那男人便把我趕出來，媽也不見我。……」</p>
<p>瞎子吃驚地睜大了盲眼，有一會才嚴峻的申斥道：</p>
<p>「瞎說！媽去上夜工。……」接著，他就想起現在已經是早上九點左右了，就是上夜工也該回來了。他沉默著，搖了搖頭，而且低聲的嘆息了。</p>
<p>小虎子受了委曲，還想分辨幾句，但他知道爸已經生氣了，便堵住嘴不語，眼睛看著水門汀地板。</p>
<p>快到夜半的時候，我們便給瞎子底啞嗓子，和女人底尖哭聲吵醒了。可是，誰都沒有起床，誰也不想去理睬他。</p>
<p>第二天，在華德路底曠地上，我又碰上他，筆直著背脊坐在那兒，不是默默的捧起木匣子搖著；可是我已看不見他那原有的興奮和得意的神氣了，只是小虎子還在另一角，為著他半邊燒餅，替十幾個路人打拳頭。</p>
<h3 id="c215">海上小唄 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 林吉</p>
<p>海之夜……</p>
<p>船起初像為鹽味的水而醉了似地，搖幌著在行走。簸跛的艙里混著人體的臭味和白漆的臭味，睡在角落里的爪哇女人發出刺耳的鼾聲，那真是攪亂我的離愁的聲音啊。</p>
<p>這是我的第一次，懷著年輕的幻夢踏上這迢遙的旅程。我有的是一顆躍動的心。</p>
<p>我愛海：「浪小的時候要看海去啊」！那樣私語著躺了下來，覺得全身都懸掛在半空中呢，搖盪得那麼利害！旁邊的旅伴也是一個年青人，他用褐色的毛氈蓋在瘦長的身體上，半啟著那細小的眼睛，做夢似地。</p>
<p>「想著什麼呢，你現在」這樣的問了。</p>
<p>「噯，有點眷戀著家呢！」</p>
<p>「真是孩子氣哪！」</p>
<p>「你也是的吧」，他兩隻手撐起半截身子，「人家瞧得見你眼眶眼淚……」</p>
<p>缺乏旅行經騐的人是有著太多的旅愁的，何況我們是離家了，往迢遙的陌生的地方去的呢？</p>
<p>等到夜深，大家都睡了以後，我還清醒著。亂想了一陣，輾轉到天亮……</p>
<p>海最美麗的時候是在黃昏吧，那是船開的第二天，覺得家是遠到只有夢中才能抓到了，便獨自個踏著沉重的腳步，到甲板上去。</p>
<p>船如同從醉裏醒過來的一樣，現在是平穩地行走著了。浪是白的，在船頭濺起一尺多高，真捲往後面去。風吹著，我彷彿聞到椰林的氣息：可是圍繞著我的却是海呵！</p>
<p>太陽掛在天邊，軟弱地灑在海面上，反射出黃金色的光。水平線上有一朵鮮紅的霞彩；對著他會想起那芒果路上踽踽走過，老是一身紅色衣裳的混血女兒來的，而且在我的屋門前她老是喜歡放慢了腳步，唱道—</p>
<p>「芒果是酸的，愛情地甜蜜，</p>
<p>黃色少年呀，你的味覺呢？」</p>
<p>而現在那曼妙的歌聲是遠了，我正漂流於海上。從我的記憶裏邊找出她來的時候，哦，我只能夠憑著欄桿望著黃錯的海……</p>
<p>船距離星洲沒有多遠了，為了渴望看見那新奇的都會歡躍起來；而我那眷戀著家的瘦長的旅伴却把浸濕了的手巾攪在頭上：病了。</p>
<p>我小心地看顧著這年青的遠行人，并且告訴他新的世界和新的日子正在我們的前面。他靜靜地，在那裏，聽著我低低的話——我竟成了一個饒舌的人了</p>
<p>可是，當我的話停止下來，他就翻了一個身，太息起來：</p>
<p>「家呵！」</p>
<p>「為什麼老是太息呀？」</p>
<p>「嗯……」</p>
<p>海上的病對於一個單身的年青人是太苦了；他的臉現出一片蒼白，看上去還呈著憔悴。僅有的兩天，我們的旅程還未走完三分之一就嘗到旅人的滋味了</p>
<p>從心底悄悄地禱告著：「願他康健…」便也躺到艙板上，想靜睡一會了。</p>
<p>海在平靜得如同一面大鏡子的時候，對著牠，人會無端做起夢來的。先是帶了口琴在甲板上吹起了「藍色的天堂」，一顆心像浸在海裏去了一般，有著鹽的味了。</p>
<p>遠行少年底感傷哪！</p>
<p>船終於到了目的地了，我那旅伴也已健康起來，我們一同地跨上了岸，奔向前程…</p>

<h3 id="c218">胡蝶近作 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>「永遠的微笑」改變作風　閩行住宅在興工建築中</p>
<p>胡蝶新作的「永遠的微笑」，在努力緊張的工作下，日內已可竣事，本月內就可與觀衆見面了。</p>
<p>關於「永遠的微笑　的內容與成就，在戲還未公映之前，我們　然木能去作估計，但是有一些工作的實况，確値得報吿的。第一是本片的導演者吳村先生的努力和精細，他是把胡蝶在這戲裏改變了以往的作風，時常以最心理的或最明晰的方法與解述使胡蝶很自然的做出他預期的演藝，因此在每個鏡頭拍竣之後，工作人員都異常欣慰，大家確定「永遠的微笑」是一部超特的作品，尤其是胡蝶在這片中的嶄新的作風，預料是會激起觀衆的驚奇。</p>
<p>另外，胡蝶在閩行自建的住宅，最近已開始興工建築，圖樣是由明星公司置景科替她設計的，完全是中國古典的宮殿的形式，非常美麗壯觀，預計明年的春天可以全部完成。她說：這是她從事水銀燈下十餘年辛苦生活的一點集蓄所建造的，確不能與好萊塢的明星巨富相比，但她已感到很大的滿足了。</p>
<h3 id="c219">南景映「羅愁綺恨」 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>辛克萊魯易的名著Dodsworth，讀者已遍全球。看過該書的人，沒有一個不受感動的。現在好萊塢的製片家高爾特文氏已將這部名著搬上銀幕。由表情深刻，「林肯」一片中的主角華爾德霍斯登担任片中的要角。幾年前紅極一時的露絲蔡德頓，與我們許久沒有在銀幕上相見，這决在「羅愁綺恨」中飾霍斯登的妻子。劇情非常深刻，叙述一個大企業家夫婦間的一段故事，對於兩性的要求，和夫婦間的愛情和難言的隱痛，做得非常透澈。該片在南京大戲院映完「鑄情」之後。卽將在本星期四公映云。</p>
<h3 id="c220">華安廣播 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>孫瑜新作全部對白有聲片「春到人間」中，嵌有唯一字幕，「但是，世界上有多少人會笑？又有多少人能笑？」意義深遠。</p>
<p>「春到人間」中有街道佈景，前街後河，右碼頭，左小弄，四面有戲，建築極堅，據一般建築師之觀察，該項房屋如眞作居住用，至少亦可住二十年。</p>
<p>「春到人間中演員除陳燕燕，梅熹，韓蘭根，劉繼羣，尙冠武，洪警鈴諸大明星外，茲更敦請周文珠加入客串，周爲數年前紅明星。其演技及說白，均極老練。</p>
<p>在「將軍之女」中，李淸爲一不屈不撓之黨人，個性硬極，嘗爲將軍所獲，將軍之女黎灼灼竟不惜屈尊追求之。演來哀艷纏綿，引人入勝。</p>
<p>韓蘭根與白璐拍「天作之合」演至「牽絲攀藤」之際，適其夫　來廠參觀，韓演得愈加精彩，淋漓盡致。韓夫人甚爲艱堪，沈導演甚爲滿意。</p>
<p>殷秀岑大腹便便，常以腹鼓挺人，當者披靡，似得「鐵布衫」眞傳。</p>
<p>總廠近因工作緊張，攝影師已不敷分配，除原有黃紹芬周達民兩攝影師外，更先後添聘陳晨沈勇石二攝影師加入前綫努力。</p>

<p>— 摩</p>
<p>乘坐舒適機力增大</p>
<p>火車的運輸業務。尤其是客運。近來有許多地方已被行駛長途的公共汽車侵入。因之象美國的幾家鐵道公司。在今年夏季裏。曾經拿低减客運費等來號召。同時在設備方面。也竭力改善。如採用流錢型車輛。地塞爾式引擎。和增加冷熱氣的空氣調節等。這都是一種吸引客運的手法。而在公共汽車公司方面呢。也决不示弱。向來祗以票價和便利上面來爭勝的。現在也更變方針。竭力在設備。速率，和舒適等處。大做工夫。我們祗要看美國長途客運汽車業中巨擘之一的「獵犬」綫的「超趨式客車」。就可以明瞭長途汽車的進步。已是十分的長足了。</p>
<p>這　近代　的「趟越式客車」是通用公司所承造的·在外表上和舊式長途汽車頗爲不同·車頭部並不尖銳·引擎的一部份業已袪除·所以樣子非常別緻·全身的流綫型保持着中庸的式子。並不過大·呌人一望上去·就有一個機力彌漫。結構堅實。和輕快流麗的印象。第一批的新車計共三百二十五輛。</p>
<p>車身的外面因爲採用金屬物爲飾。燦爛奪目。異常新頴可喜。車頭部因爲後引擎的緣故。所以從橡皮製的保險槓以上。直到車頂僞止。始漸漸地平斜向後。很爲好看。駕駛人的坐位。正在車子的前端。位置很高。足以淸晰地瞭望來車。和前面的路上情形。比起舊式汽車確要高明多多。這是由於他的地拉優越。和保險玻璃的大風屛的綠故。</p>
<p>乘客的地位也大爲增高。在震搖錢以上。聲息和塵埃多能避免不少。旅客們從保不破碎的窗玻璃中。可以瞭望來往客車的車頂。在舒適方面說。因爲將「輪上坐位」完全取銷。所有的座位一槪舒適。車軸和車輪的震動。就不致擾及乘客了。</p>
<p>雖然乘客的座位提高。但是全車的重心却較前大爲抑低。這樣一來。在安全和載物方面。獲得格外的利便。車身全部的高矗部份也已銷除。車中的坐椅。墊子非常厚軟。椅架係用鎂及鋁的金屬物所造。十分悅目。坐墊深軟。頭部靠依是一種科學的設計。並且有可移動的臂靠。坐椅可自由改換位置。共有四種不同的位置。供客自擇。可以望野境，讀書報，休息，或瞌睡。身子高而腿部長的乘客。他在車中也能獲得相當的舒適。因爲坐椅間的伸足部份。已較往昔增加了不少呢。</p>
<p>車中搭客們的伸足地位雖然增寬。可是全車的地位同時增大。這種「超越式客車」中可搭客三十六人。從前不過二十三人而已。這個較多的地位。是由於將車廂伸展至原來的摩托地位而獲得的。車廂中寬暢無阻。一些沒有障礙物。因爲許多隨手携帶的行李。都置放在下層的車廂中。與客坐截然隔雖。就格外見到暢適。座椅的上面另裝一些櫃架。專備客人們放置零星包紮物件等之用。客人們從平地登車。祗要一舉足之勞。就是一個凹嵌在內通廊。與全車的長度相同。座位處却在這通廊的上一步。車廊內部完全近代化，光亮噴漆的板壁。鑲以金屬物邊綠。燈光也安全採用新式。車項用摩沙玻璃爲飾。燈光由內部照出。柔和而華麗。別有風趣。</p>
<p>「超越式客車」的引擎力量非常鉅大。裝在車的尾部。與後軸並行。這樣裝法。不但增進機力和效用。並具在聲息行動方面。格外的安靜平穩。震動减少。熄滅時氣息也引擎所在地與客坐的車廂。分別隔離。甚爲嚴密。故震動較少。車底層有兩個車廂。建造十分嚴密。水和灰塵一些也不會侵入。這裏專爲安置衣箱行李箱籠及大件包裹之用。原來公共汽車中常見的車項包裹架子。已經完全取消了。存放行李的車間。有門直向外面開啟。可以隨便放入或取出。車子行駛的時候。門是完全封閉的。這種新車子的行李運輸量比較從前舊式的要增加不少。新車全部大半爲堅緻的鋁金屬所造。所以結構上的力量很是偉大可以增多兩噸的重量呢。</p>

<p>美國電影明星購置派卡派卡車雍容華貴。向爲有產階級所樂用，近據美國加利福尼亞派卡汽車銷售商阿桑納氏之調査。在美國之著名電影明星中。其已購置派卡汽車者。在一百人以上。據桑氏稱。好萊塢爲各種漂亮及新式事物之集中所。特開風氣之先。爲各方觀瞻所繫。市上大號派卡及一二〇號型所在都是。足令外來人士。心嚮往之。尤其在著名影星導演等之集合塲所。派卡更爲一時領袖汽車。桑氏又稱好萊塢事物除漂亮之外。又必具有實用及需用之要素。派卡之風格精絕。能與影星相得益彰云云。</p>
<p>車上無綫電收音機　美國之無綫電事業日益發達。據估計本年上半年中之收音機銷數。已超過一九三五年之最高峯。生產方面多出百分之十五至二十五。銷路上漲起百分之十五至三十。其中允以汽車中裝置無綫電收音機者爲更見增進。本年一月至六月份止之六個月中。無綫電收音機之用於車上者。其銷數超出一九三五年自百分之三十至一百五十。一九三五年末汽車之裝有無綫電機註册者祗佔百分之十七。其數目爲客車三·九〇〇·〇〇〇輛。而據估計至本年底止。其數將達五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇輛云。</p>
<p>有興趣的汽車分析　據美國汽車會一一九三六年發行之「汽車事實與數字」一書一內稱。一九三五年美國所製造之汽車與零件等。其批發之總價值為美金三，三一九，九七三元。去年美國所造之汽車其數量爲四，一一九，八一一輛。與汽車製造銷售等直接或問接上所僱用之員工。其總數逾六，六〇〇，〇〇〇人，其中四三九，〇〇〇人。係直接受僱於汽車及其零伴之製造。若輩於一九三五年間所得之工資數爲六五七，三三二，〇〇〇元。一九三五年所產之汽車數量。及其銷售上所得之價値。較之汽車事業最不景氣之一九三二年高出幾達百分之二〇〇。以磅數及馬力計算一九三五年汽車之價値。其結果如下。一九三五年汽車每磅價格平鈞爲美金二角一分。較之一九三五年汽車每磅價格平均爲美金二角一分。較之一九二五年出品廉去一角七分。以馬力計則去年汽車每匹馬力之售價爲美金七元。一九二五年時則爲二十七元五角。</p>

The rumor that Ambassador Kawagoe will return home for a trip is unlikely to be realized for the time being. According to a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, Consul General Suma is scheduled to meet with Gao Zongwu, director of the Asian Department of our Foreign Ministry, at 3:00 PM tomorrow to continue exchanging opinions on Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues. The rumor that Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations have broken down and been interrupted is not accurate. (8th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, since Kawagoe left Beijing for Shanghai, our side's attitude and process on various negotiation issues between China and Japan have been reported in the newspapers. The bleak future of the current negotiations between the city and Japan is indeed a fact. However, after Ambassador Kawagoe left Beijing, the side negotiations of the diplomatic officials of both sides continued to exchange opinions. However, the two sides did not meet on the 8th. Under the current circumstances, whether the negotiations on adjusting relations between China and Japan can make progress will depend on how the Japanese side handles the Suiyuan and Qingdao incidents. Furthermore, the Qingdao incident seemed to have eased slightly yesterday. If the Japanese side can seek a solution in the right way, it is hoped that it will come to an end in the short term. Mayor Shen sent a telegram to the capital on the 8th to report. Foreign telegrams stated that Ambassador Kawagoe intends to return to Japan for a trip, but according to various sources, it seems that this will not be realized for the time being.

<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, after a certain semi-official Italian news agency published a message stating that the Italian government would recognize "Manchukuo," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs copied the original text and questioned the Italian ambassador. On the morning of the 8th, the Italian Embassy sent Secretary Felaire to visit Li Dijun, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Foreign Ministry, saying that the Italian government had no such intention.

<p>(Tokyo) According to news received by this newspaper today, the German government recently requested the Japanese commercial consul in Berlin to reduce Japan's exports to Germany, otherwise it would allow Germany to increase its exports to Japan, predicting that there will be fierce competition in the economic interests of the two countries. It is reported that the current trade agreement between the two countries stipulates that the ratio of Japan's annual exports to Germany to Germany's exports to Japan is one to four, but last year Japan's trade with Germany was actually in surplus, with a ratio of one to three to one to two, which is very different from the originally stipulated one to four, causing deep dissatisfaction on the German side. It is rumored that Japan is preparing to reject Germany's above-mentioned request on the pretext that Japan has indirectly purchased a large number of German machinery products dumped in China.

<p>(Tianjin) Capital is still the prerequisite issue for the economic development of North China. Although the plan approved by the Tianjin Japanese military department to the central leadership has been approved, conflicts with Guanwai are becoming increasingly serious in terms of the political views held. The South Manchuria Railway Xingzhong Corporation is restricted by Guanwai forces and cannot directly invest. The various domestic financial groups are also taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the Suiyuan incident. The Tianjin military department continues to engage in endless superficial contacts, but in reality, they will all come to a standstill. The Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway and Longyan Mine affairs will also be difficult to organize due to the difficulty in finding capital. Staff Officer Wachi flew to Qingdao a few days ago to meet with Commander Oikawa of the fleet to discuss the Qingdao case, hoping not to expand it, so that North China can gradually return to stability and various plans can be implemented. Recently, observing the policy held by this side, the Qingdao case will take a sharp turn and can be resolved peacefully. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Matters for Discussion: (1) A joint report from Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industries and Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Interior regarding the drafting of implementation measures based on the outline of the "Measures for Reorganizing Farmland Water Conservancy Along Rivers and Lakes," requested review and approval.

After consulting with the Huai River Commission and dispatching personnel for joint discussion, it was proposed to change the title of the original charter to "Temporary Charter for the Collection of Sluice Usage Fees in the Huai River Basin by the Ministry of Finance," and the title of the original measures to "Temporary Measures for the Collection of Sluice Usage Fees in the Huai River Basin by the Ministry of Finance."

<p>(Nanjing) National Government Committee Member and former Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Political Reorganization Committee stationed in Beiping, Huang Fu, passed away from illness at his residence in Shanghai. At the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 8th, the method of conferring honors and compensation was largely discussed as follows: (1) Hold a public funeral; (2) Submit a request to the National Government for a commendation order; (3) Allocate funds for funeral expenses.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Sino-British Gengkuan loan borrowed by the Huai River Commission for the construction of the Huaiyin, Shaobo, Liujian, and Gaoyou sluices, the original contract stipulated that the Ministry of Finance would guarantee it. The principal and interest repayment fund was also stipulated to be allocated from the revenue of navigation freight donations collected after the completion of the project. If it was insufficient, the Ministry of Finance, as the guarantor, would make up the difference. Because the Ministry of Finance bore the responsibility of unlimited guarantee for this loan, it established the "Collection Office for Sluice Usage Fees in the Huai River Basin Area" in accordance with the contract to collect usage fees. Su Nehou was appointed as the director of the office. The "Temporary Charter for the Collection Office" and the "Temporary Measures for Collecting Usage Fees" were also submitted to the Executive Yuan and passed at the meeting on the 8th. The rate and level of this usage fee are based on the product of the length and width of the ship's deck in meters, with one grade for every five meters. For passenger and cargo ships under five meters at the Huaiyin Sluice, the fee is one yuan per ship, and one yuan is added for every five meters. Empty ships are charged one-fourth of the fee for loaded ships. The Shaobo and Liujian Sluices charge three-tenths of the Huai rate for loaded ships, and one-third for fixed ships. The Gaoyou Sluice charges one-tenth of the Huai rate for loaded ships, and empty ships are exempt. This will be implemented on a trial basis for six months. If the future income exceeds the amount of principal and interest due, the donation rate should be appropriately reduced to ease the burden on boat owners. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The draft implementation measures for the outline of the "Measures for Reorganizing Farmland Water Conservancy Along Rivers and Lakes" was passed by the Executive Yuan on the 8th.

<h3 id="e42">The Implementation of the New Soviet Constitution <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The new Soviet Constitution, which contains a strong democratic color, was revised and adopted by the Eighth All-Union Congress on the fifth and implemented on the same day. The content of this new constitution is not only very different from the previous one, but also better demonstrates the success of Soviet social construction. The original current Soviet Constitution was made under the environment after the revolution, and because of the victory of social construction in the past ten years, the environment has been completely different. Therefore, the old constitution is no longer applicable. Therefore, the proposal to amend the Federal Constitution was put forward at the Seventh Soviet Congress held at the end of January last year. After passing, Stalin and 30 others were appointed to form a constitutional amendment committee to engage in constitutional amendment work. After more than a year of work, it was completed in May this year and the draft was published on June 12 to seek criticism from all parties. At the end of last month, the Eighth Soviet Congress was convened to discuss the draft. After some revisions, it was fully adopted on the 5th and put into effect on the same day.</p>
<p>There are many characteristics of the new constitution, the most important of which is the tendency of democratization. The famous French writer Romain Rolland once said, "The new Soviet Constitution is enough to show the breadth of the meaning of democratic politics. The establishment of this new constitution shows the true meaning of freedom and equality." The most able to express the tendency of democracy is that the new constitution stipulates that the representatives of the Soviet of all levels are elected by voters in accordance with the universal, equal, direct and secret voting method. Such a thorough democratic color cannot be found in any democratic country. The adoption of this thorough democratization election law cancels many previous restrictions on the people's elections and expands the scope of the right to vote. This cannot but be said to be the success of Soviet social construction.</p>
<p>The second is the provision on private property. Since the adoption of the New Economic Policy in the Soviet Union, private capital has been allowed to exist. This new constitution expressly stipulates the legal protection of private property. The draft constitution did not stipulate the right to inherit citizens' personal property, but it was revised in this congress, stipulating that the right of inheritance is protected by law. In this way, the new constitution is more obvious in protecting private economy. However, we must recognize that this kind of private economy is "limited to being based on individual labor without exploiting the labor of others."</p>
<p>The third is the provision on declaring war. Article 49 of the new constitution stipulates that "During the adjournment of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, if the Soviet Union is subjected to armed attack or if it is necessary to perform the obligations of international mutual assistance to resist aggression, the Presidium shall declare war." The third sentence in this article was not in the constitutional draft, but was added in this congress. Because after the conclusion of the French-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement, even if the Soviet Union itself is not subjected to armed attack, but France is subjected to an unprovoked attack, the Soviet Union also has the obligation to declare war. This treaty provision is obviously aimed at countries such as Germany and Japan that are invading outwards.</p>
<p>In addition, there are certainly many characteristics of the new Soviet constitution, which will not be listed here. In short, the making of this new constitution is really the fruit of the successful social construction of the Soviet Union in the past ten years. The implementation of this democratic new constitution not only has great significance internally, but also has a great effect externally. Because in this world filled with fascist forces, democratic politics has become the end of its rope, but now such a new force has been added. This has a great contribution to the maintenance of world peace. Moreover, the amendment of this constitution in the Soviet Union makes it easier to approach the three major democratic countries of Britain, France and the United States, forming a grand alliance of democratic countries to deal with the aggressive behavior of international fascism. This also has a very important impact on the international political situation.</p>

<p>(London) Although the marriage advocated by King Edward is not approved by the cabinet, the constitutional crisis caused by this matter will not necessarily require the King to abdicate. There is still room for maneuver in the current situation. (Seventh Day Shanghai Evening Post Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Brownlow, a friend of the British King and a major landowner, read a statement issued by Mrs. Simpson to dozens of reporters at the Grand Hotel in Cannes, France, last night. He then handed over the original manuscript to everyone present and solemnly stated that Mrs. Simpson had not received any visitors. The statement was signed by Mrs. Simpson, but Mrs. Simpson did not attend. It said, "In the past few weeks, Mrs. Simpson has repeatedly tried to avoid any actions or suggestions that would be detrimental to the British King or his throne. Her attitude has not changed. If she withdraws now and can solve the problem, then she is willing to withdraw from this unpleasant situation that cannot be sustained by both parties." This statement came suddenly, and even the palace staff were surprised when they heard it. They did not expect Mrs. Simpson to have such a firm position. Even the British King's entourage at Belvedere Palace did not know about it at first. However, this statement cannot end the current crisis, but is only Mrs. Simpson's personal opinion. The phrase "If she withdraws now and can solve the problem" is particularly noteworthy. According to insiders, Mrs. Simpson's move was purely her own decision. Now only the British King's actions can end the current situation. No matter how important other steps are, their effectiveness is limited. However, Mrs. Simpson's move has aroused a more hopeful atmosphere in Parliament. People generally believe that this is also a way out of the difficulty. Others believe that this move may lead to a sudden turn in the situation. (Eighth Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) Lord Brownlow, who escorted Mrs. Simpson to France, spoke with a reporter from the American News Agency on the phone in Cannes, France, today, saying, "The statement issued by Mrs. Simpson shows that if her withdrawal can completely solve the current difficulties, then Mrs. Simpson will definitely withdraw immediately. Therefore, Mrs. Simpson's attitude is clear. Now Mrs. Simpson is very tired and does not want to be disturbed by others." Brownlow refused to indicate whether Mrs. Simpson's statement meant that she had actually withdrawn, but said that everything should be decided by the British King. The reporter then asked what relationship the British King's abdication had with Mrs. Simpson's plan. Brownlow said that Mrs. Simpson had not discussed this matter with him. The reporter asked again, "When will they get married?" The Lord said, "How strange this question is! How would I know?" (Seventh Day National News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British official circles declared today that the statement issued by Sir Brownlow on behalf of Mrs. Simpson in Cannes, France, must have been done at the will of the British King. From this, it can be seen that the British King may have decided not to marry for the time being. (Seventh Day National News Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cannes, France The Associated Press learned from reliable sources today that some of the wording in Mrs. Simpson's statement was actually instructed by a certain party in London via wireless telephone. (Eighth Day National News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Evening Star carried today that before Mrs. Simpson went to Cannes, France, from England, she told the British King that if the King's decision affected his responsibility to the Empire, he should not be troubled by his obligations to her. According to the owner of the Evening Star, who has family ties with Mrs. Simpson, this news is accurate and reliable. (Eighth Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) This morning, a mysterious airplane departed from Gatwick, England, and flew to Cannes, France, via Croydon (near London), Poilloux (near Paris), and Lyon. The airplane was a biplane and belonged to British Airways. When it landed at Croydon Airport, three passengers suddenly boarded the airplane, but even the airline did not know their names. The airplane arrived in Lyon at 2:15 PM and continued to take off at 3:00 PM, heading towards Cannes. (Eighth Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) There is much speculation about the mysterious airplane that flew from Croydon Airport to Cannes, France, this morning. The airplane stopped at Le Bourget Airport in France for more than an hour due to bad weather. Seeing that there was no hope of stopping the wind and rain for a while, it continued to take off after refueling. It is said that there were three men on board. Another saying is that these three people are from the British Home Office. A team of gendarmes guarded the Lyon Airport, where the airplane was scheduled to land for refueling, and all idlers were not allowed to approach the airport. (Eighth Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The News Chronicle published a commentary on Mrs. Simpson's statement today, saying, "The King's personal abandonment of the path to marriage has now been clarified by a word from his lover. What she can do, he can also do, and it is his duty." (Seventh Day National News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Evening Standard reported that Mrs. Simpson not only has a responsibility to her lover, but also to the King of England. Now that Mrs. Simpson has issued a statement, unwilling to put the British King in a difficult situation because of her, the British King should be able to prioritize the country and no longer be persistent. The Daily Express said that Mrs. Simpson's statement can only be regarded as a declaration. The Morning Post carried that whatever final decision the British King makes will inevitably make him unhappy, which is a natural trend. Although the article published by Mrs. Simpson may be able to save the most deteriorated situation, it is enough to prove the above point. If the British King can resolutely sacrifice private feelings and take the right path, then his current pain will be richly rewarded in his future peaceful heart and the general trend of the world.

<p>(London) People from all over the British Empire expressed their support for King Edward's marriage today. However, according to powerful sources, Edward will ultimately not be able to have both beauty and country. It is rumored that the cabinet has passed a draft abdication edict and presented it to the King for his perusal. The King is considering flying to Cannes, France, to discuss with Mrs. Simpson, but it is not certain whether his entourage will allow him to do so. Labour MP Wegwood, a leader who advocates supporting the King, told the press after Prime Minister Baldwin's speech in the House of Commons today, "The current situation has improved slightly. The cabinet will not take any action before the King replies. I really don't understand why the King needs to abdicate. Last Saturday, we all thought that the abdication issue was imminent, but until now, the emotions of the people have gradually changed, and the King does not need to make a decision in a hurry. The government should know the danger of the rise of fascism. The Fascist Party has taken the opportunity to express that they are the King's only supporters. This situation is quite dangerous." (Seventh Day National News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The situation regarding the marriage issue has not changed this morning. The Attorney General of Cornwall, namely the King's confidant Monkton, and the Revenue Director of the county, Peacock, went to the Downing Street Prime Minister's Office yesterday to meet with Prime Minister Baldwin. This morning, at 9:00 AM, they returned to London from Belvedere Palace in the King's official car to conduct official business. This morning, a special airplane flew to Cannes, France, from Croydon Airport in the suburbs, carrying three passengers whose names are unknown. Prime Minister Baldwin received Home Secretary Sir Simon and First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Hoare at 10:45 AM. Someone invited Churchill, the leader of the extremist faction of the Conservative Party, to deliver a broadcast speech to the United States on the constitutional dispute, which Churchill immediately refused. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain and former British High Commissioner to Egypt Lord Lloyd originally planned to travel to Paris today, but they have now canceled their plans. In addition, the stock exchange has improved because of the more hopeful prospect of resolving the marriage issue. The exchange rate of the pound and the market prices of various British securities have all risen. (Eighth Day Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) When the House of Commons discussed the British King's marriage today, former cabinet member and independent MP Wegwood asked Prime Minister Baldwin if he could be given an opportunity to discuss the motion he had proposed on Thursday. (Wegwood's intention was to declare that having previously sworn allegiance to the British King, this oath would not be shaken by any form of coronation ceremony or the absence of any dignitaries at the coronation. The House of Commons would not appoint another person as the monarch of England. He asked the House of Commons to approve this motion.) The Prime Minister replied that he could not. Wegwood continued to speak, but the Speaker stopped him, saying that the Prime Minister had given a clear answer to his question. The diplomatic seats in the House of Commons today were full. Sir Miville, the private secretary of the Duke of York, the heir to the throne, was also in the audience. During the meeting, Churchill was quite eloquent. Those who supported the government said that Churchill's statement that the cabinet had no right to advise the King to abdicate and that the cabinet had no right to predetermine its position without first consulting the will of Parliament was mainly to oppose the Prime Minister. The King still holds the decision. (Seventh Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Home Secretary Sir Simon, on behalf of Prime Minister Baldwin, replied to the question of Labour opposition leader Attlee today, stating that the Prime Minister would not add anything to the declaration made yesterday. (Eighth Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Labour MPs convened a meeting today to discuss the constitutional dispute caused by the British King's intention to marry Mrs. Simpson. The number of attendees was unprecedented, but no decision was made. It is said that the party's current opinion is that the government has the responsibility to deal with the situation. However, when the opportunity is slightly missed, the Prime Minister is afraid of being criticized by all parties. The meeting also believed that there was no need to formulate a special policy at this time. It is heard that at the meeting today, many speakers advocated that the British King should accept the advice of the cabinet when it gives its advice.</p>
<p>Baldwin also had informal talks with cabinet members this morning, but it seems that there will be no major developments before the British King makes a final decision. Around noon today, there was no sign that Baldwin would make a declaration in the House of Commons. At the same time, Foreign Secretary Eden has also decided not to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting convened in Geneva on Thursday because of this matter. The British side will be represented by diplomat Viscount Cranborne. The number of important figures coming and going has not been as large today as in the past. The Duke and Duchess of York returned to Piccadilly Residence this morning. The British King's younger brother, the Duke of Kent, drove to Bielvittier Palace in a black and white car this afternoon. (Seventh Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to general claims within the House of Commons lounge, the House of Commons hopes that the King will announce his final decision before the end of this week, so that the volatile and uncertain situation will quickly disappear, and the relationship between the country and the territories of the Empire will also tend to be stable. In short, the attitude expressed by all members of Parliament has made it impossible for the King to resist on constitutional grounds. Even if the general public expresses sympathy to the King, it will be of no avail. Therefore, the general situation has not changed. As for Churchill's actions and similar fascist demonstrations, they only make members of Parliament fear that a small number of politicians will use the marriage issue to oppose Parliament or constitutional procedures, and therefore have to be vigilant. Moreover, the whole House of Commons applauded Prime Minister Baldwin this afternoon, not entirely for the Prime Minister, but also to express support for the constitutional principles represented by the Prime Minister. What is currently being discussed in the House of Commons lounge is only the question of when the King will abdicate. It is generally expected that if the King does not give up the idea of marrying Mrs. Simpson, he will announce his abdication at the end of this week. According to several people in the inner court, the King has not yet signed the abdication document, and his attitude is still hesitant.</p>
<p>There is also a saying in the House of Commons lounge that before making a final decision, the King will go to Cannes, France, to visit Mrs. Simpson. The official airplane is currently waiting for orders at the Belvedere Palace airport.</p>
<p>In addition, if the King's abdication becomes a fact, who should be the successor? There are various speculations, and opinions differ. Some Conservative Party members support the establishment of the daughter of the current King's second brother, the Duke of York, Princess Elizabeth (currently ten years old) as Queen, and the establishment of a Regency Council to administer state affairs. However, no decision has been made on this matter yet. The King's confidant, namely the Attorney General of Cornwall, Monkton, is currently negotiating with the cabinet to resolve the issue of the King's status after abdication.

Kerp said, "The German study group's trip to the Far East was to study the markets of Asian countries, especially the Chinese market, to what extent they can be expanded. By referring to the commercial policies in Germany's new economic plan, we can promote mutual trade. The Chinese reconstruction plan, especially the military organization, is very important and has been very effective. The Chinese National Government and the Kuomintang have the same goals, and their actions are like arms and fingers working together. Regarding the cooperation between China and other countries and the League of Nations, the industrial relations maintained by Britain, the United States, and Germany are closer than those of other countries. Germany has been supplying China with large quantities of goods in recent years. In terms of financial relations, Britain and the United States occupy a more advantageous position in China. In conclusion, Germany's friendship with China is very sincere. Germany can supply all the industrial products needed for China's reconstruction without limitation. China is rich in natural resources and can supply Germany with various raw materials, the quantity of which may be larger than the industrial products supplied by Germany." (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

Officers from the Fukuya Police Station under their jurisdiction went to investigate and found that it was the Soviet freighter "Typhoon Tyrschikikh Krashing" (4,500 tons, owned by Pippi Airnaer Gut). The area belongs to the 3rd region of the Tsugaru Fortress, and is a key area for military industry, and it is obviously an invasion of territorial waters, so it immediately telegraphed the Army and Navy Ministries and the Foreign Affairs Section of the Hokkaido Government, and cooperated with the Tsugaru Fortress Command, Hakodate Military Police Branch, and Hakodate District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Because the "Four Strong" and "Typina" incidents had occurred successively before, the Foreign Affairs Section of the Hokkaido Government attached great importance to it, and requested the Ominato Naval Base to send aircraft and destroyers.

<h3 id="e68">After Several Counterattacks, the Bandits and Puppets Were Defeated; A Certain Army Assembles to Participate in the Battle; Bandit Troops Now Gathered at Damiaozi and Shangdu; A Certain Army Draws 3,000 Men from Various Units; Ulanqab League’s Prince Pan Wang Also Leads Troops to Attack Bandit Troops <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Suiyuan: After being defeated by our army on the morning of the 3rd, the puppet bandits who counterattacked Bailingmiao, with four to five thousand bandits, launched another counterattack on our army's front lines at around 2 PM that afternoon, under the cover of aircraft from a certain country. Until after dusk, they launched five or six continuous attacks. Under the intense artillery fire, our army calmly fought back and once again repelled the bandit army. The bandits suffered over 500 casualties. Our army captured a great number of spoils of war. In the vicinity of Bailingmiao after the battle, a large number of defeated and fleeing soldiers were found. Our army treated them kindly and provided relief. At dawn on the morning of the 4th, the bandits launched another full-scale attack on Bailingmiao. In addition to gathering forces from nearby mountains, a large number of bandit troops were also transferred from Damiaozi, the bandit headquarters in northern Suiyuan. Under the cover of artillery, aircraft, and armored vehicles from a certain country, they launched a fierce attack on our positions. At this time, the morale of our army was even higher, and they bravely fought back. After several hours of intense fighting, including hand-to-hand combat, our army launched a counterattack at noon, and the bandits were unable to withstand it. They scattered and fled in different directions. Some fled by vehicle under the cover of aircraft from a certain country, some fled in disarray, and some were dying from cold and hunger. The dead and wounded were piled up like pillows, a pitiful sight. One of the bandit army's captains led over 300 men and surrendered to our side. Our side has always been lenient to those who surrender and treated them favorably. The remaining defeated soldiers are also being taken in and relieved. The bandit army suffered heavy losses in this battle and scattered in disarray. Currently, there are no bandit traces within fifty to sixty li of Bailingmiao. Our army is actively setting up defensive works and is looking for opportunities to eliminate the remaining bandits.</p>
<p>According to the surrendering bandits, "The bandit troops have not eaten for two days and are suffering from hunger and cold. The morale of the troops is low, and the bandit troops were either coerced or deceived into coming. Since their arrival was not their wish, who would be willing to die for nothing? Therefore, everyone lacks the will to fight. Moreover, from afar, they heard that compatriots across the country were donating money to save the country. We are all Chinese, and who has no conscience? Therefore, they are determined to uphold the principle that Chinese should not fight Chinese. Therefore, when the national army arrives, they all wish to surrender." Currently, the gathering points of the bandit forces are Damiaozi in northern Suiyuan and Shangdu in northern Chahar. In Damiaozi, there are over 2,000 men from the Shi Ying bandit unit, over 1,000 men from the Prince De bandit unit, and smaller units from Jin Jia, Li Shouxin, and other bandit units, totaling no more than 5,000 men. In Shangdu, there are five to six thousand men from Li Shouxin's bandit army, over 1,000 men from Prince De's bandit army, and a puppet army unit. In addition, the puppet regime has transferred a unit of puppet troops from each military district in Rehe, which has now arrived in Guyuan. It is reported that a certain side has transferred a small portion of men from various units of a certain army, totaling 3,000 men, who will also go to the front lines to participate in the war. However, our army's defenses in both eastern and northern Suiyuan are extremely solid, and the bandit forces will hardly succeed.</p>
<p>The Ulanqab League's Sizi Wang Banner is located in a strategic area. Since the situation in northern Suiyuan became tense, the banner's environment has also become tense. Later, after Bailingmiao was captured by the national army, the fleeing bandit troops were attacked by the banner's security team, and the bandit troops suffered significant losses. Recently, the bandit side prepared to counterattack and infiltrated the banner's border from the Taolin grassland. On the 1st of this month, they engaged in a fierce battle with the security team led by Jasaq Pandegong Chabu of the banner. The fighting continued on the 2nd and 3rd. It is reported that nearby stationed troops have been ordered to go there, hoping to join forces with Prince Pan's cavalry to eliminate the bandit puppets.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers' Enthusiasm</p>
<p>This reporter visited the Fourth Elementary School Wounded Soldiers Hospital on the afternoon of the 5th to comfort the wounded soldiers. Mr. Yun Hanzhang, a military medical officer at the hospital, guided the tour. The hospital is using the facilities of the Fourth Elementary School. The buildings are spacious, well-lit, and the interior is clean. The food and all equipment meet hygiene standards. Mr. Yun also gives regular talks to lightly wounded soldiers, imparting various knowledge. After offering my condolences, I was able to briefly talk with Mr. Wang, who was less severely wounded, about the situation at the front lines. According to Mr. Wang, "We soldiers are indebted to the nation for nurturing us. Our duty is to defend the country and protect the people. Now that the bandits and puppets are invading, it is our duty to eliminate the bandits. The national army soldiers and brothers who participated in this battle all understand this principle. As soon as they hear of the bandit army, they bravely rush forward, with a spirit of advancing without retreating and having me without an enemy, hoping to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Therefore, wherever the national army goes, the bandit army is like withered leaves and rotten branches, collapsing and fleeing. All the soldiers and brothers are honored to be able to go to the front lines and kill the enemy, and they are ashamed of not being sent to the front lines. Even the wounded brothers do not want to retreat. Except for those who are discovered by the medical team and carried to the rear for treatment, many wounded brothers endure the pain and continue to kill the enemy without being willing to go to the rear for recuperation. Once our injuries are slightly better, we are determined to go to the front lines again to kill the bandits and protect the national territory," and so on.</p>
<p>People's Militia's Indignation</p>
<p>After leaving the Wounded Soldiers Hospital, this reporter went to the small school ground to visit the Suiyuan Anti-Communist Self-Defense Corps' Regular Detachment Training Department. The Regular Detachment is composed of people's militia recruited from various counties, with each term lasting four months and consisting of 3,000 people. Upon arriving at the department, the entire Regular Detachment was gathered on the parade ground, listening to a speech by a certain committee member. The training director of the detachment is Mr. Li Dachao. The soldiers stood straight in the cold wind for over an hour, without showing any signs of shivering. It is said that the soldiers in this term have only been training for two months, but their order and spirit are quite good. After the certain committee member's speech ended, this reporter gathered several team members in a corner of the parade ground and spoke for a short while, learning that they all possess patriotic fervor. According to them, after this training, they will use the military knowledge and skills they have learned to teach other villagers upon returning to their hometowns, in order to organize the villagers in each village, so that each village becomes an organized and united unit, to bear the responsibility of defending the local area and eliminating traitorous bandits. In the future, they can also serve as the rear guard for the regular army and perform various necessary tasks in the rear. The current situation in Suiyuan is critical. If the villagers do not unite to defend themselves and the country, they will not even be able to become slaves like the people of Korea and Taiwan. Who does not have parents, wives, and children? Who does not have ancestors' graves? Rather than seeking to be slaves in the future and not being able to obtain it, why not sacrifice everything now to protect the national territory? Therefore, they are now preparing to sacrifice everything to serve as the rear guard for the army, and so on. From this, one can glimpse the flourishing of Suiyuan's public spirit.</p>
<p>Patriotism of Prostitutes</p>
<p>While the Suiyuan soldiers are valiantly and relentlessly suppressing the bandit puppets, the prostitutes in the rear are also filled with patriotic thoughts. Therefore, they have elected representatives to comfort the wounded soldiers and donate money to comfort the soldiers. The prostitutes have declared to the outside world, "We are all Chinese, and each of us has a share in loving the country. If the Suiyuan region is invaded by bandits and puppets, our relatives will be slaughtered by the traitorous bandits and will not be able to survive. Therefore, although the occupation of prostitutes is pitiful and our strength is meager, our hearts for loving the country are the same," and so on.</p>
<p>Soldiers Volunteering</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Suiyuan war, the national army soldiers were deeply indignant and all wished to go to the battlefield to kill the bandits as soon as possible. Soldiers who had not been transferred to the front lines mostly volunteered to their superiors. The following is the original text of the request from the Provisional Cavalry Company to Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, which shows a glimpse of the morale: "To Commander-in-Chief: This is a report from all the soldiers of the Cavalry Company of the Fourth Regiment. Now that the national crisis is at hand, it is extremely urgent. Only because our regiment has already gone to the front lines to resist the enemy, we are determined to pursue and eliminate the puppet bandits. Our company has not gone to the front lines to participate in the battle. We ask the Commander-in-Chief, all the soldiers of our company are willing to go to the front lines to resist the enemy. We are determined that there must be a reason why our company has not departed, but we do not know what kind of responsibility we bear that we have not gone. We soldiers are very ashamed because we eat from the country and wear from the country, but when the time comes, we are not needed. Our public raises us in vain. If there is another opportunity, we hope that the Commander-in-Chief will let our company participate no matter what. It is the wish of all the soldiers in our company to sacrifice for the country without hesitation. Since the mobilization order was issued, we have been preparing day and night, and our hearts are very happy and our spirits are greatly increased. Until now, we have not gone to the front lines to pursue and eliminate the puppet bandits. The soldiers feel unhappy in their hearts. It is not that we are afraid of death, it is just that all the soldiers in our company are also very willing to sacrifice. Even if we sacrifice, it is the duty of a soldier to die on the front lines rather than be a slave to a conquered nation. This is the goal of all the soldiers in our company. Asking the Commander-in-Chief is safe. Written and stamped by Sergeant Tian Puzhen, Liu Baolan, Yang Hanwu, Li Ziwen, and six other people from the Provisional Cavalry Company." (6th)</p>

<p>District Committee Demands Remittance of Funds</p>
<p>The business community of this county purchased donations for pre-birthday celebrations, and were ordered to raise 4,375 yuan. Previously, 2,000 yuan had been collected and remitted to the provincial authorities. The remainder had not been collected immediately due to the depression of commerce. Now, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Second District has sent a committee member, Shi Zipeng, to Kunshan to demand the remittance of these donations. The Chamber of Commerce, considering the importance of the matter, convened an emergency meeting on the 6th and decided to collect another 10% based on the business tax amount, and appointed Xu Chufang and 31 others to go out and vigorously persuade those with limited means to pay the funds to the Chamber of Commerce for remittance before the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>Promoting the Comfort Bag Movement</p>
<p>The Women's Association here has recently decided to promote the "Women's Comfort Bag Movement," advocating the use of items needed on the front lines to comfort the Jin-Sui soldiers, and thereby inspire the patriotic enthusiasm of the Changshu women's community. These comfort bags are made of domestic green cloth, the size of a Boy Scout's dry food bag, containing medicines, first aid supplies, food, and a thermos, etc. The mouth of the bag is sealed by the women themselves, and the bag also contains a letter written by the women to encourage the soldiers, so that the soldiers will be even more courageous in their loyalty upon receiving it. Now, once a sufficient number has been collected, they will be handed over to the county authorities for delivery to the front lines.</p>
<p>Also, Suspicious Deposits Found</p>
<p>Zhu Xingliang, the county's accounting director, recently discovered suspected embezzlement in the county government's local tax collection office. After detaining Bian Zhongtai, the director of collection, a savings book was recently discovered in the county government's general affairs office, with deposits totaling over 18,000 yuan. It is suspected whether it is a legitimate fund, and the funds have been seized and reported to the province for instructions. In addition, two savings books of a certain item in the local Industrial Bank in the city have also been notified by the county authorities to be seized and stopped for payment after the embezzlement case in the local tax collection office was discovered.</p>

<p>Cold Weather, First Snowfall</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, the weather has been dry with no rain, and the cold has been extreme. On the morning of the 7th, thick clouds covered the sky, as if it would rain, and the weather felt even colder. The Fahrenheit thermometer dropped to 43.7 degrees.

At around 7 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, Mao Axing, Mao Ahong, Mao Jinbao, and other families were suddenly careless. At that time, the wind was strong and the fire was fierce. The villagers' houses were mostly made of wood and firewood, which easily caught fire, so it quickly became uncontrollable, spreading to Mao Tingzheng, Mao Sanmazi, Mao Genxing, Mao Er'an, Mao Ronglin, Mao Kun Gen, Mao Quan Gen, and more than twenty other families, with more than ninety houses destroyed, resulting in losses of tens of thousands. Now, the affected families are wailing and crying loudly. The town head, Mao Jinshan, is collecting donations on their behalf to provide relief.</p>

<p>Zhang Jinlian, a farmer in Buliangzhou, Binjiang Township, the eighth district of the county, had some wealth, which attracted the covetousness of bandits. On the night of the 5th, a number of bandits suddenly broke into the house with sharp weapons. At that time, Zhang and her sister were both in the room. The bandits tied them up with ropes and forced them to tell where the hidden silver was. After a slight hesitation, they were whipped. Then, Zhang's sister was burned with fire, causing her to be covered in burns. Zhang and others could not bear the pain and spat out the truth, resulting in more than fifty yuan in cash and various clothes and jewelry being stolen.</p>

<p>No Wheat Sprouts in the Four Townships</p>
<p>In the western townships of Jiangdu, there has been a severe drought since autumn. Most of the wheat planting required waterwheel irrigation. The fields planted on high ground barely planted during the slight rain and muddy softness. Except for the fields near the river, none have sprouted to this day. Even in the Jiuzhong Bridge area around the North Lake, because the lake water has dried up in winter, although the wheat has sprouted, it has now withered. Since the beginning of winter, there has been no rain or snow. Due to the severe cold and drought, farmers have abandoned their homes and gone to Jiangnan to seek food. Farmers from Huaihai have also come to Yangzhou. Seeing that the situation is not good, they have also crossed the river. On the 4th and 5th, various counties in Jiangnan expelled those from Jiangbei returning to their hometowns in an endless stream, all passing through the Dongguan area of this county. They are gathering in groups of three to five, begging for food and heading north together.</p>

<p>Details of Liquor Shop Tax Evasion Case</p>
<p>Chen Sheng Liquor Shop in the western suburbs of this port was found to have evaded donations and taxes by Xiang Pi Zhen, a supervising committee member of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance. He often took the account books of the shop to the Yin-Feng Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau for thorough investigation. It is now known that the owner of the shop, Lou Ruxin, is a local business leader, and the shop is the largest liquor shop in the Ningbo area. The following is the process of the discovery of tax evasion this time: The Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department noted that the collection of tobacco and alcohol taxes in the Ningbo factory was far less than the previous year's quota, so it specially sent Xiang Pi Zhen to Ningbo for thorough investigation. After arriving in Ningbo, the staff went to the Yin-Feng Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Branch Bureau to inquire about the reasons for the shortfall. The branch bureau replied that the market was sluggish and the business was depressed. Xiang then believed that although the sluggish market was one of the reasons for the shortfall, if the person responsible for collecting the taxes did not conduct a thorough inspection, the business community would arbitrarily evade donations and taxes, which was unavoidable. He then secretly investigated and discovered that the shop's production and sales volume were far different from the declared donation amount. The staff then handed over three copies of the shop's incoming and outgoing rolling stock book for the 25th year to the branch bureau for calculation. As a result, it was found that there had been tax evasion every year, and in the 25th year alone, there were 5,622 liters of private liquor, and 135 jars of private liquor were still being brewed and had not been taxed. It is reported that the shop will be punished in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>The cultural relics of the Palace Museum have been stored in the old site of Renji Hospital on Tiantang Street in the French Concession of Shanghai for three years. During this period, relevant agencies such as the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Education have sent personnel to open the boxes to inspect whether the various cultural relics are consistent with the storage list. However, due to the large number of items, the counting has not yet been completed. Now that the preservation warehouse building in Chaotian Palace, Nanjing has been completed, the Executive Yuan has approved the transportation of all the cultural relics stored in Shanghai to the warehouse in Beijing for preservation of the precious products of our country's past dynasties. The cultural relics in Shanghai include historical calligraphy and paintings, bronzes, porcelains, ancient books, jades, cloisonné enamel, lacquerware, silverware, rhinoceros horn ware, and silk tapestries. Most of them are precious products from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Among the bronzes, there are many ancient objects from the Three Dynasties, which are particularly famous and rare. They are all packed in separate boxes, totaling more than 24,000 boxes.</p>

The loading was handled by Mautai &amp; Co., with a total of more than 40 loading trucks. Each time a box was moved out of the warehouse, the porters were given a token, and the staff registered it at the same time. It was not until 4:45 PM that it stopped. A total of 3,151 boxes of cultural relics were transported, including 76 boxes of the "Yi" character, 2,466 boxes of the "Hu" character, 189 boxes of the "Kan" character, and 420 boxes of the "Shang" character.</p>
<p>Strict Security</p>
<p>The special trains for transporting cultural relics consisted of 32 freight cars specially prepared by the Railway Bureau, parked at the Mackenzie Road Station. The station and its surroundings were guarded by police officers from the Public Security Bureau, soldiers from the Security Corps, together with military police and railway police. On the way from the warehouse to the Mackenzie Road Station, Chinese detectives from the French Concession Police Department were dispatched to protect the vehicles. A large number of Chinese and Western detectives were also stationed at the warehouse and Tiantang Street. They waited until 5 PM before withdrawing. The cultural relics special train left for Beijing at 11 PM last night. In addition to sending Xing Zhiliang and others to transport the cultural relics, the office also had military police, police officers, and railway police accompanying and protecting the train. According to the staff of the Shanghai Office of the Palace Museum, due to the large number of boxes of cultural relics stored in Shanghai, it was originally planned to transport 6,000 boxes first today (i.e., yesterday), but only 3,151 boxes could be transported. Among them were porcelain, bronzes, calligraphy, and paintings. The rest will continue to be shipped every three days.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Impact of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Detaining Rice Leads to Panic in Shanghai Grain Market; Representatives Sent to Zhenjiang Yesterday to Petition Jiangsu; Petition Submitted to Zhejiang to Expedite Release of Detained Rice <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Local Associations, Rice Merchants' Guild, Rice Grain Sales Guild, and Bean and Rice Trade Guild, due to the detention of rice shipments to Shanghai by Jiangsu's Jinshan, Qingpu, and other counties, as well as Zhejiang's Yongjia, Zhenhai, and other counties, has led to panic in the Shanghai grain market. Regarding Jiangsu Province, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Local Associations sent Gu Xinyi; the Bean and Rice Trade Guild sent Qiang Zisheng and Lu Jingwen; the Rice Merchants' Guild sent Lu Wenshao; and the Rice Grain Sales Guild's Rice Transport Merchants United Association sent Jiang Shizhi, a total of five people. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, they jointly took the 8:00 AM Nanjing-Shanghai express train to Zhenjiang to petition the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Construction, Department of Finance, and Department of Civil Affairs, requesting them to comply with the Provisional Measures for Food Regulation of the Executive Yuan, to allow free domestic circulation, and to release the detained rice ships destined for Shanghai in order to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens. Regarding Zhejiang Province, a petition was submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: Regarding a petition matter, on the 7th of this month, a letter was received from the Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes, and Related Industries Association, stating that the Yu Deqian Feng Company of the association had jointly ordered 9,700 bags of white rice from the Zhao Chunji Grain Store in Yongjia last month, which was purchased in Yueqing and Pingyang counties. A deposit of 20,000 yuan was paid immediately, with a one-month deadline for delivery. This rice has already been milled, but unexpectedly, the two counties suddenly prohibited its transportation. The small firms reported this to your association, and requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to provide a certificate for them to take to prove the situation, but it was still ineffective. Now, Zhao Chunji is pressing for the remaining payment, but the detained rice has not been released, and there is a risk of spoilage. The circulation of funds is greatly affected. Therefore, we are specially requesting your association to forward a petition to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, ordering Yueqing and Pingyang counties to release the detained white rice as soon as possible. Furthermore, the Da Cheng Company of the association stated that 5,000 shi of rice processed in Zhenhai were detained by the county. We also request that this case be included in the petition to order the county to release the rice. According to the above, the free domestic circulation of food has been decided by the central government. However, Yueqing, Pingyang, Zhenhai, and other counties in Zhejiang Province are obstructing the circulation of rice destined for Shanghai to provide food for the people. How can they obstruct circulation and defy laws and regulations? According to the previous situation, we dare not avoid bothering you with a letter requesting your association to investigate and verify the facts, and to prepare a document based on the facts to petition the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting them to instruct the relevant counties to release the rice purchased by Shanghai merchants immediately, in order to maintain government orders, which is a matter of public convenience. It was reported to the association that the Executive Yuan passed the Provisional Measures for Food Regulation on the 24th of last month, the first item of which states that food should be allowed to circulate freely within the country, and that the measures proposed by various provinces and cities to restrict the export of food are inconsistent with economic principles and the central government's principle of overall food management. All provinces and cities should immediately stop the ban on transportation. Now that rice from various counties in western Zhejiang is allowed to leave the province, Yueqing and Pingyang in southern Zhejiang, and Zhenhai in eastern Zhejiang, are still banning the export of rice, which is clearly inconsistent with the Executive Yuan's intention to stop the ban on transportation uniformly. Therefore, we have prepared a document to petition your government for review, requesting that you instruct the governments of each county to release the rice detained by Shanghai merchants immediately in order to maintain government orders, which is a matter of public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Japanese Shanghai Daily on Errors in Understanding China: Those Who View China with the Mindset of China Twenty or Thirty Years Ago and Consider Themselves China Experts Should Change Quickly <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily published a commentary on the 7th of this month, titled "Understanding China! A Quick Change is Needed." An abridged translation of the main points is as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, the views of China held by so-called "China experts" in Japan are inevitably too outdated. Chinese newspapers often use the term "China expert" with sarcasm. The "China experts" in the so-called "view of China" are indeed something we should change. Why? In the past, our entry into China was based on views of China using terms such as "big country" and "sleeping lion." These terms have now become a thing of the past. Under the rule of the Nanjing government, China is now steadily advancing towards a modern unified nation. From the late Qing Dynasty to the early days of the revolution, the national situation was as chaotic as tangled hemp. Now, things are very different. However, if we introduce the progress of China, those who consider themselves China experts will immediately utter words of contempt for China, saying, "What does China have?" This kind of view is truly inappropriate. How can one hope to achieve cooperation and friendship by despising one's opponent? If one truly wants to cooperate and be friendly, one must recognize the position of the other country. Today, Japan is recognized by everyone as the leader of the East. However, despising the other country will only lead to being despised by the other country. The same is true for Japan's relationship with China. The "China view" of "China experts" is flaunted as the representative view of China in Japan, which is regrettable. The reason is that they are discussing China with the mindset of China twenty or thirty years ago, which is already very outdated. Any view of China that comes from the mouths of "China experts" and any negotiations conducted based on such views will hardly achieve any results. If you want to understand the situation in China, you cannot judge the merits and demerits of China based on the situation in major cities such as Nanjing, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Look at the personnel of the Nanjing government agencies. Whether it is the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or the Ministry of Military Affairs, they can all report to work at 8:00 AM (7:30 AM in summer). This is very different from the public life of the Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. If Japan can be called "Young Japan," then China can be regarded as "Adolescent or Infant" China. China, which has established a central government in recent years, was originally in its infancy and is now moving from adolescence to youth. For example, today's Chinese youth, none of them smoke opium. Opium destroying the country is a story from the Qing Dynasty. Today's Chinese youth carry the nation on their backs, and the cry of opium destroying the country has long become a dream of the past. Today, no matter which country it is, its international relations are subject to a stronger influence than before, which is a major reason. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, China is strengthening its unification, and the youth of the whole country have great faith in Chiang. This is the reality of China's progress. Therefore, if we desire Sino-Japanese cooperation, we must first quickly change Japan's understanding of China based on the aforementioned viewpoints and treat China with a new perspective. Only then can we expect Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Municipal and County Rice Industry Guilds Telegraphed the Executive Yuan <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Request:</p>
<p>Lift the Ban on Rice Grain Exports; Do Not Allow Reduction or Exemption of Taxes on Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Nanjing-Shanghai Municipal and County Rice Industry Guilds, due to news reports that the Guangdong Provincial Government has telegraphed the central government to exempt taxes on imported foreign rice, stated that if this is approved, it would not only affect the rural economy but also lead to the outflow of rights and interests. Therefore, yesterday, they telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting that it not be approved, and further requesting that it order all provinces to quickly lift the ban on rice exports to facilitate domestic circulation. The original telegram is recorded below: To Premier Chiang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing: We have found that the provincial governments, in order to prevent smuggling to the sea, have banned the export of rice grains, which has caused panic among the people in rice-deficient provinces. After repeated appeals from our associations, we were fortunate to have your approval not to do so. However, obstruction under various pretexts is still heard from time to time. The most serious case is that of Jiading County detaining rice ships destined for Shanghai, which has not yet been resolved. If the ban by this province is not lifted, then surpluses cannot make up for shortages, and mutual circulation is not possible. Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Government has submitted a request to the central government to reduce or exempt taxes on imported foreign rice, which has been announced in the newspapers, causing widespread consternation. We have found that the taxation of foreign rice was originally intended to prevent the outflow of rights and interests and to protect farmers. Although Guangdong Province feels a shortage of rice, rice-producing areas can circulate and supply it. Moreover, with the Guangdong-Hankou Railway open, it is no longer difficult to transport from rice-producing provinces in the Yangtze River basin. In addition, this year's grain harvest is abundant everywhere, and the rural economy is expected to recover. Instead of procuring foreign rice, which would lead to the outflow of money, it would be better to purchase it from various provinces to retain rights and interests. If the province's request is approved, the rural economy of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will inevitably be affected, and sales in rice-producing provinces will stagnate. This would be contrary to the central government's intention to manage food overall. Our associations feel a sense of danger and cannot remain silent. We dare to telegram your leader for review, hoping that you will order all provinces to quickly lift the ban on rice exports, and that the Guangdong Province's request to exempt taxes on imported foreign rice will not be approved, in order to protect farmers and merchants. We would be endlessly grateful. Gu Xinyi, Standing Chairman; Zhao Zixin, Zhu Zixiang, Yin Zhongren, and Pang Qinsheng, Standing Committee Members, of the Joint Association of Rice Industry Guilds of Jiangsu Nanjing-Shanghai Municipal and County, respectfully kowtow. Another 50,000 yuan was remitted to the central government.</p>

<p>Another 50,000 Yuan Remitted to the Central Government</p>
<p>The committee for raising funds in Shanghai to purchase and present airplanes to the government as a memorial to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's fiftieth birthday held a meeting of organizers at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the fifth. The following people attended: Chief Organizer Li Dachao, Organizers Zhou Songhe, Lin Puxuan, Zhou Nanjiao, Li Jimin, Lu Zhangyan, Gu Shangrui, Li Huiran, Zhang Xiamin, Chen Shuo, Liu Songtao, and others. Li Dachao chaired the meeting, and Chen Shuo took the minutes. The chairman reported that the city had already remitted 660,000 yuan to the Chiang Kai-shek Birthday Airplane Presentation Memorial Committee. The China Aviation Association previously held over 30,000 yuan of the city's fundraising achievements, as well as other uncounted funds, and the amount recently received by the committee could reach over 720,000 yuan. For the remaining amount, various organizations and groups have already made commitments. Although not all funds have been collected, they are being actively promoted. Today, relevant organizations and groups are invited to discuss solutions so that the funds can be remitted and the matter concluded as soon as possible. The "One-Day Movement" for aviation patriotism and presenting airplanes for birthday celebrations has been enthusiastically supported by all sectors, organizations, groups, and industries, and the results are good. Now, the "One-Day Movement" for the real estate industry is being continued, with all tenants in the city donating one day's rent on behalf of the landlords. The Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Citizens' United Association have been asked to promote this actively, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has approved the forwarding of a letter to the Real Estate Industry Association to lead the promotion. The committee has again made effective efforts to promote this in all relevant aspects, striving to achieve the goal and complete the mission as soon as possible. After each organizer reported on the progress of contacts, multiple proposals for the direction of progress were discussed.</p>
<p>The airplane purchase memorial received 660,000 yuan in donations from the city for the birthday airplane presentation and has repeatedly reported this in previous newspapers. Yesterday, the committee remitted another 50,000 yuan through the Shanghai City Bank, and the remaining amount will be remitted before the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Rongjin Grand Theater on Kangti Road has decided to donate all of its business income today to the "One-Day Movement," which is worthy of admiration for its enthusiasm for support. It is reported that the films are the latest purchases of the Yi Hua Company, starring Xi Limen, Zhou Xuan, Ma Roufen, etc. The times are 2:30 PM, 4:30 PM, 6:30 PM, and 9:00 PM, with four shows. The ticket price is uniformly 2 jiao.</p>

The joint memorial text is recorded below: (1) Memorial text from the Local Association: On December 8, 25th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Local Association, Du Yong, Qian Yongming, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Hede, Xu Xinliu, Zhang Yin, Liu Hongsheng, Mu Xiangyue, Lin Zujin, Zhang Jiaao, Hu Yunqiu, Zhu Qinglan, Qin Zuze, Guo Shun, Xu Jiqing, Wu Yun Chu, Kui Yanfang, Chen Huide, Feng Bingnan, Wang Boyuan, Guo Bingwen, Zou Bingwen, Huang Yanpei, Xu Caicheng, Wang Kui Sheng, Wu Zaizhang, Wang Zhixin, He Dekui, Pan Xulun, Li Zushen, Pan Wenan, Cai Zhengya, Jin Guobao, etc., respectfully offer incense, flowers, and clear wine to the spirit of Mr. Yingbai, saying: The spirit of the world, the five hundred years, accumulated and magnificent, gave birth to a hero. Accomplished in military and civil affairs, deeply rooted. Heart for the country, actions like an orphan. Guangwu restored the Han Dynasty, Lu Lian rejected Qin. The schemes in the tent, no task was not personally involved. Coming out to face the foreign powers, entering to lead the central government. Wherever he went, nothing was not seen. The year was full of difficulties, and strong enemies were rampant. Seizing our borders, spying on our old capital. Throwing off his sleeves and rising up, hurriedly accepting orders. Relying only on his fortitude, not counting gains or losses. Exhausted by labor, worried to the point of death. A great star suddenly fell, leaving endless regrets. Alas, may you enjoy the sacrifice. (2) Memorial text from the New China Construction Society: On December 8, 25th year of the Republic of China, the members of the New China Construction Society respectfully offer clear wine and plain food to the spirit of Chairman Huang Gong Yingbai, saying: Alas, to settle difficulties and revive the nation, wise men are relied upon. Why is Heaven so dark, taking away the wise leader? Thinking of our chairman, since he advocated righteousness in the late Qing Dynasty, enduring great dangers and overcoming great difficulties, shouldering many arduous tasks, and saving this endangered nation, doing what others could not do, and enduring what others could not endure, countless times. But the chairman was exhausted by constant anxiety and became ill, shortening his own life for the sake of our people. His loyalty shines like the sun and moon. The chairman has no regrets in his life. However, the people of the country recite his dying words of concern for the country. How will they be grateful and inspired to fulfill their responsibilities to the dead and comfort the chairman's spirit in heaven? Since the chairman's passing, people far and near are mourning together. Moreover, the members of our society have been working together in scholarship for years, seeking ways to save the country and the people. We rely on the chairman to create it and lead it, and now there are some beginnings. But the work is not yet finished, why did the chairman suddenly pass away? Alas, the national crisis is urgent, who will be the Great Wall? For the great cause of restoration, who will set an example? Alas, may you enjoy the sacrifice. (3) Memorial text from Xu Qingfu and other relatives and friends: On December 8, 25th year of the Republic of China, Qingfu and others respectfully offer plain food and clear wine to the spirit of Huang Gong Yingbai, saying: Alas, our chairman, a divine dragon in the sky, his coming had no signs, and his departure had no trace. Living in the late Qing Dynasty, the country shrank for hundreds of miles. The wild boar and the long snake chose fat to devour. What the chairman saw and what the chairman worried about. With lofty ambitions, he threw away his pen and traveled east. Forming alliances with heroes, seeking each other's voices. Taking oaths of blood, heart to heart. The chairman's learning reached from martial to civil. The chairman's cultivation took the essence and used it extensively. If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you get the tiger's cubs? Returning to the northern court, lowering his body and surrendering his ambition. Viewing the mountains and rivers there, recognizing their heroes. Not counting the harvest, but focusing on cultivation first. The Xinhai Revolution, soaring in Shanghai. Loving and assisting Wu Xing, building a governor's mansion. Entering to participate in the tent, going out to lead the division. Planning and creating systems, with countless warp and weft. Taking Nanjing in the west, supporting Wuhan in the north. Providing equipment and food, with miraculous calculations. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, all followed like the wind. Lifting up on the left and supporting on the right, blending like water and milk. The Duke of Shanghai was the first to recommend the founding meritorious officials. The Duke of Shanghai said to me, no one else but you. The failure of Gui Chou, from the east to the west. A net of heaven and earth, walking on dangerous ground as if it were flat. In the defense of the country, repeating the effort. Success was not held, writing books to explore the truth. The lessons of the European War, shouting loudly. Saving the country and preserving its existence, preparing for the worst. Heard by the central government, the central government praised it. Participating in the Washington Conference, making a name on the international stage. The chairman's knowledge and strategy are unparalleled. The chairman's talent and reputation attract many scholars. The National Revolutionary Army rose up, taking charge of the regent's power. Consolidating the republic, stabilizing the foundation of the country. Quickly retreating with the current, nurturing obscurity and waiting for the opportunity. Acting when the opportunity arose, and being good at hiding his power. Feng Hua's northern expedition, welcoming the Duke to the south. Widely using divine plans, unifying China. Silently extinguishing the red flames, seeing the blue sky again. His功 lies in the party and the country, and his芳 flows in the simple volumes. The enemy's atmosphere came east, invading our territory. The country's door was wide open, the strong and the weak were different. The Duke's resistance to insults, standing in the front line. Enduring humiliation and bearing the heavy burden, three springs and two winters, all for the sake of the country. Uniquely shouldering the difficult task, worrying deeply and using his mind most bitterly. Supporting the endangered, exhausting his strength in his life. Bowing and devoting himself to the task until his death, exhausting his精 and spirit. Alas, our chairman, sacrificing himself for the country. Leaving with black hair, returning with white hair. The liver had no disease at first, but now it has cancer. Cancer cannot be cured, cutting short his natural life. Alas, our chairman, silently going away, Mount Tai is collapsing, what will the people rely on? Alas, our chairman, though dead, is still alive. His spirit will not be extinguished, and his smiling face will always remain. His靈 will be in heaven, coming to格 and享. Alas, may you enjoy the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Cheng Jingyi, General Secretary of the National General Assembly of the Chinese Christian Church in Beiping, came to Shanghai. Zhao Jinqing, Chairman of the War Zone Relief Committee of the Shanghai Christian Association, held a banquet at the Western Restaurant of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at noon yesterday. Wang Wanbai, Huang Hanxin, Lu Ganchen, and twenty other people attended. Zhao Jinqing delivered a welcoming speech. Then, Cheng Jingyi reported that when he left Beiping, according to the report of the Suiyuan War Zone Inspection Team, Pastors Zhang and Gao, after inspecting the Suiyuan War Zone, made the following decisions on the spot: (1) Request the National Christian Council to select the National Church to jointly manage war zone relief efforts; (2) Plead for the people in the war zone: (1) The compatriots in the Suiyuan War Zone are either freezing and starving to death, or dying from gunshot wounds, or even sitting and waiting to die. Can we bear not to save them? (2) We have always said that we love Jesus, love the country, and love our compatriots. Now is the opportunity to put our love into practice. (3) "If anyone does not love his brother, whom he has seen, he cannot love God, whom he has not seen." (4) "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me." (5) Love is not just lip service; it is about practical action. Relieving compatriots in the war zone is serving God. (3) The letter to the national church members is as follows: "Respected Sir/Madam, The bandit-puppet invasion of Suiyuan has aroused public outrage around the world. In view of the fact that the compatriots in the war zone have suffered greatly from the war and the soldiers on the front lines are loyally defending the country, our association has specially organized the War Zone Relief Committee to raise emergency relief funds. We have entrusted Cheng Jingyi, General Secretary of the National General Assembly of the Chinese Christian Church in Beiping, and Professor Mei Yibao of Yenching University to investigate the needs of the disaster areas nearby in order to raise funds. Now, the military and civilians are in urgent need of relief. They are not sure they can even last the day. Therefore, we urgently appeal and seek relief. We hope that the believers of each church will have the heart of Christ's compassion for the world, sympathize with the compatriots who have suffered, pay attention to saving food and clothing, economize on entertainment, and actively contribute and work hard to raise funds. The first phase is scheduled to end at the end of this year. For any items, please hand them over to the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA for forwarding. If it is a donation, you can entrust it to your church pastor to deposit it, or directly entrust it in the name of our association to the Bank of China on Sanma Road Bund, Zhejiang Industrial Bank on Beijing Road, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank Branch on Eight Immortals Bridge, or Jincheng Bank Branch on Eight Immortals Bridge to remit it to the war zone for relief. This matter concerns the survival of the nation and the life and death of our compatriots. All of us believers must do our best to fulfill our great duty. Sincerely requesting peace. Zhao Jinqing, President."</p>
<h3 id="e97">Cotton Order Breach of Contract Litigation <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>You Ju-sun sues Gui Yan-fang</p>
<p>Shouji Company, Yu Jusun, purchased 112,000 dan of Shanghai Chinese Cloth Exchange standard cotton for July from Tongji Company on July 9th of this year. A contract was signed, stating that the price per dan was 45.40 yuan, with delivery at the end of the month. Shouji paid a deposit of 150,000 yuan. If either party violated the contract, a penalty of double the deposit amount would be imposed. Later, due to circumstances, the contract could not be fulfilled on time, so the contract was revised to extend the period by one month. However, when the deadline arrived, the seller still did not send samples, so it was not possible to ship the goods to him. It was not until September that the seller delivered part of the goods. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the quality of the 64,700 bales of cotton stored in the warehouse was very poor and significantly different from the original sample. The buyer requested the seller to terminate the contract, return the deposit, and compensate for the losses. After a long negotiation, no agreement could be reached. Therefore, Yun Jusun hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a lawsuit against Tongji Gui Yanfang in the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment to repay the deposit of 150,000 yuan, the warehouse and insurance fees of 50,000 yuan, the breach of contract penalty of 300,000 yuan, and the annual interest of 5% on each item, as well as litigation costs. After several hearings, no conclusion was reached. Yesterday morning, the Civil Court President Li Hu specially convened a collegiate bench to summon both parties and the giant of the silk and cotton industry, Shen Changgeng, to the case for interrogation. Since further investigation was still needed, it was ordered to postpone the hearing to another date.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Details of the Derailment of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Train the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>A freight train that departed from Beijing on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway the morning before yesterday derailed between Wuxi Zhoujingxiang Station, causing the Beijing-Kai express train to be delayed. This was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, news has come from the bureau that differs slightly from what was reported yesterday. Therefore, it is continued as follows: On the morning of the 7th, freight train No. 505 departed from Beijing. At 4:17 pm, after departing from Wuxi Station, when it reached the 118-kilometer mark between Wuxi and Zhoujingxiang Stations, the axle of the fifth carriage, the Jiangnan Railway freight car No. 2642, suddenly broke, causing the entire train to be unable to move. After receiving the report, the Zhoujingxiang Station Master urgently reported to the Wuxi Station officials, who dispatched the Beijing-Kai midday express train locomotive that had arrived at the station to the scene of the accident to tow the rear carriages of the freight train back to Wuxi Station. The front carriages were taken to Zhoujingxiang Station by the freight train locomotive. The broken axle car was urgently dispatched from Wujin Station with a rescue car and a crane to attempt rescue. Because it was late at night and there was rain and snow, the work was difficult. It was not until 11 pm that it was hoisted and moved off the track. At that time, the special express train that departed from Nanjing at 5 pm had also arrived at Wuxi Station after the midday express train. It was ordered to merge and depart from Wuxi, according to the special express train schedule, a delay of two hours and forty-four minutes. Along the way, because there were more cars attached, the journey was inevitably slow. When it reached Anting, there was a slight delay due to the removal of the broken hook car, so it arrived in Shanghai at 3:07 am on the 8th, a delay of four hours and seventeen minutes, six hours later than the arrival time of the midday express train. The reason for the Jiangnan car's axle breakage is currently being investigated by the railway.</p>

<p>The winter relief matters in this city have always been handled by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau ordering charitable organizations to handle them separately. Now that the severe winter is approaching in an instant, the general public without clothes or food is suffering from hunger and cold. It is said that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to carry out relief as soon as possible, yesterday ordered the Zhabei Charity Group to quickly organize soup kitchens as usual. At the same time, the United Association of Charitable Organizations has also prepared shelters. The Social Affairs Bureau has sent a letter to the Timber Industry Association to borrow 40,000 feet of pine boards as usual so that the shelter located in the Chaozhou Wuyi Guild Hall can be established as soon as possible. It will also be increased as needed in the future.</p>

Unexpectedly, the shop received a letter yesterday with a Chang pawn ticket from Tangjia Ji Zhengda Pawnshop attached, which was for the three robbed sewing machines, worth 75 yuan. Obviously, the thieves were familiar with the business. The shop owner reported it to the police station for investigation. However, according to the detectives, robberies have been occurring frequently recently, and the trend of robbery is probably due to the needs of winter.</p>

<p>Pan Tingdong from Zhenjiang, Wen Heqing from Ningbo, etc., recently opened Jincheng Hardware Store at No. 24, Lane 531, Tangshan Road, with a capital of only 20-30 yuan. At that time, they ordered goods from various merchants. Lida Screw Factory at No. 216 Fujian Road sent goods such as butterfly screws worth 863 yuan. However, not long after opening, Jincheng closed down, and Pan and others disappeared. It was not until 5 pm the day before yesterday that Chinese detectives Wang Guangtian and Zhang Kuidong of the Chengdu Road Police Station learned that Pan and the salesman Wen Baofu from Ningbo were hiding at No. 18, Lane 790, Gongping Road. They immediately went there and arrested Pan and others. After Pan confessed that Wen was hiding in Room 33 of the Aidu Hotel at No. 10 Balili Bridge Road in the French Concession, they went and arrested Wen. Later, after further confession, Zhang Qilong from Ningbo was also involved. Zhang was hiding at No. 140 Tangshan Road. So they went to arrest him. In addition to Pan and Yan confessing to falsely establishing a company to defraud Lida Factory, they also defrauded goods from Huachang, China Universal Factory, Kailang Company, Yongfeng Screw Factory, etc. However, Wen and Zhang only confessed to selling goods on consignment and denied any collusion or fraud. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the situation and requested permission to detain them in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law because the police had not completed the investigation.

<h3 id="e105">Record of the Second Regular Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Engineer Rafalusin Reports on the Situation in Hainan Island</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering held its second regular meeting at the Wuzhou Building at 6 pm on the 6th of this month. President Lu Zhixue announced the opening of the meeting. First, the secretary read the minutes of the previous meeting, which were approved by the members. Then, the chairman introduced Mr. Rafalusin, former engineer of the Muling Coal Mine and current consultant engineer of the Dutch Silver Company, to the colleagues. Mr. Rafalusin summarized the mining survey of Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, and used diagrams and photographs to illustrate. The survey was conducted by Mr. Rafalusin, accompanied by a Chinese geologist and an American miner. The entire process took 82 days, covering a distance of 603 kilometers on foot and by measurement, 60 kilometers on horseback, and 1,260 kilometers by car. The area surveyed in detail was 200 square kilometers, the area inspected was 900 square kilometers, and the area investigated was 1,200 square kilometers. Hainan Island is located between 18 and 20 degrees north latitude and 108 degrees 30 minutes to 111 degrees east longitude. The total population is 400,000. The main seaport is called Haikou, which is 460 kilometers from Hong Kong. The original report was very detailed and interesting. An excerpt of the original text is as follows: In southern Hainan Island, the summer climate is often above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, with an average between 80 and 97 degrees. In July, August, and September, there is heavy rain almost every day. The island's plants have been studied by students of Lingnan University and Chinese and foreign scientists. The most common diseases are malaria and hookworm disease. 85% of the rural population suffers from hookworm disease, and the incidence of malaria is similar. Medical treatment is provided by municipal and American Presbyterian hospitals. Agricultural products include rice, beans, peanuts, sesame seeds, and indigo. Oak, lacquer, sugarcane, pineapple, coffee, cocoa, etc. are all cultivated, but animals are not very reproductive. Three years ago, tin mines were opened in northern Hainan Island. As of September of this year, a total of 270 tons of tin have been produced. There are still about 430 tons of reserves in the same area. It can be seen that the scale of tin mining is not large, but the benefits are still good. The survey team regretted that it could not complete the survey of the central part of the island. According to the report of the Industrial and Commercial Survey Team, in addition to tin mines, there are also outcrops of gold, antimony, lead, sulfur, iron, and copper mines, but they have not been tested and their commercial value is unknown. At 8 pm, there was a dinner. During the dinner, Mr. Cheng Zhongshi, Director of the Mining Bureau, gave a speech on the future trend of China's mining industry and the improvement of government agency administration, explaining that Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry hopes that government agencies will be commercialized to increase efficiency. Director Cheng has been serving in the mining industry for more than 20 years and is well aware of the difficulties of mining merchants. Now that he is the administrative officer, he should be able to solve all the difficulties for mining merchants and benefit the mining industry immensely. Those who attended the meeting that day included Li Zushen, Liu Hongsheng, Cheng Zhongshi, Yu Heyin, Yu Gengshi, Yang Yunyan, Cai Renfu, Gu Zhiyun, Su Jianxun, Rafalusin, Yi Chaogeng, Pan Taomin, Shen Maiqun, Lu Zhixue, Sun Xianhui, Qu Lianke, Zheng Weisan, Guo Chengen, Kang Shiqing, Yu Mingyu, Fang Zizhong, Wang Shengsan, Shen Yuanru, and others, a total of 23 people. The meeting ended happily at 9:30 pm. It is said that the cost of the dinner was borne by Wang Ziven, Yu Ziwei, and Sun Deqing.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Domestic Goods Movement Federation, in order to promote the use of domestic goods by women, previously hired domestic goods female visitors to visit housewives in sections and persuade them to use domestic goods. Yesterday, the federation re-determined the visiting areas, including Shen Wenxian's Xiaoshadu Road, Xu Chengqing's Malang Road, Chen Yingfen's Saposai Road, Xu Songzi's Julai Road, and Lin Wenjin's Shenfu Road. They started visiting yesterday.</p>

<p>Liu Zhonghua from Shaoxing, who lives at No. 8 Guangyuli, Tiantong Road, works in the post office and has a wife and concubine. The wife, Lang, and the concubine, Hu Cuiying (from Shaoxing, 20 years old), all live together. Liu has a nephew, Yao Shoudi, 22 years old, from Zhenhai, who lives at No. 9 Chunyangli, Dongyouheng Road, and works in the real estate department of Tongyuan Bank on Tianjin Road. His family is relatively well-off. On the 2nd of last month, Yao suddenly received a letter from lawyer Ma Leming, commissioned by Liu's Hu Cuiying. The letter stated that on the 26th of last month, Yao invited Hu Cuiying to his home. Hu went the next morning. Yao asked her to wash the quilt and tricked her into the inner room, serving her a cup of tea. Unexpectedly, after drinking the tea, she became confused and was raped by Yao. That night, he even dared to go to the family's house and was reprimanded by her husband, Liu Zhonghua, and his wife, Lang. Yao then invited Yao Gengsheng to come and make trouble. After reporting to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, they were released after being reprimanded. Finally, Yao's actions of insulting his elders and raping others with drugs clearly violated Article 221 of the Criminal Law. He was asked to discuss reconciliation, etc. Liu Zhonghua also repeatedly went to Tongyuan Bank and publicly declared it to Yao's colleague, Le Xiuzhen, etc. Yao believes that Liu Zhonghua and Liu Hu Cuiying are setting up a scheme to falsely accuse him and maliciously defame him. Therefore, he hired lawyer Chen Maoxuan to file a lawsuit for defamation and fraud in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. According to his reasons for the lawsuit, on October 25, Liu Zhonghua's wife borrowed 50 yuan from the plaintiff but failed. Holding a grudge, she colluded to commit fraud to vent her anger. She even maliciously defamed him at the plaintiff's place of work and then commissioned a lawyer to send a letter with threatening words, which clearly violated the Criminal Law's defamation and fraud charges. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan opened the Fifth Criminal Court for interrogation and immediately declared the conclusion, pending sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Second Special Court Continues to Hear the Case of Gu Zhuxuan Each Person Firmly Denies Inciting to Recant Zhao Guangfu's Testimony is Irrelevant The Case Still Needs to be Investigated and Continued to Another Date <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan from Yancheng, the former owner of the Quanchan Stage, was arrested for being suspected of inciting murder in the Tang Jiapeng assassination case. During the period when the Second High Court of Appeal was hearing the case and scheduling a sentencing date, Gu bribed Wu Lu, the head of the guard sent by the Second Special Court's detention center to the Guangci Hospital's external prison ward, and the guard Ma Xianxiang, who in turn entrusted Wang Yushou, the head of the guard of the Second Special Prison, and the guards Ma Xianxiang, Ma Xiancai, Wang Bogang, etc., to buy off the prisoners Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Yangui (also known as Xiao Sizi) to recant their testimony and acquit him. After the case was revealed, the Ma Xianxiang and Ma Xiancai brothers, Wang Yushou, Wang Bogang, etc., abandoned their posts and fled. Wu Lu and Ma Xianxiang were detained. After the prosecutor Wang Ren of the Second Special Court checked with the Daya Bank and confirmed that there was a deposit of 2,000 yuan under the name of Zhang Sen, after investigation, Gu's brother Gu Songmao was also suspected. Therefore, Gu Zhuxuan, Gu Songmao, Wu Lu, Ma Xianxiang, etc. were publicly prosecuted by the prosecutor in the Criminal Court of the same court on charges of inciting to recant and dereliction of duty. At the same time, an order was issued to arrest the escaped guards, the Ma brothers and the two Wangs, in the case. The public prosecution case has been tried several times without a conclusion. Now, Judge Chen Shuoying has taken over the case and opened a new trial, scheduling another hearing at a later date. All the circumstances have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:45 pm, Judge Chen, together with Prosecutor Wang, continued the trial of the defendants in the Second Criminal Court. The defense lawyers selected by the defendants, Jiang Yiping, Cao Shoulin, Gao Wenqi, etc., also arrived on time to await instructions. The court first summoned the defendant Ma Xianxiang, 24 years old, from Anhui. In April of the 22nd year, Judge Xiong introduced him to the detention center of this court as a guard. Although the guards Ma Xianxiang and Ma Xiancai in the prison were his uncles, they did not interact with each other. This time in Shanghai, he only got to know them after his uncle mentioned it. Their duties were different, and they did not often meet and talk. Wu Lu was the head guard in the detention center. I did not worship him as a teacher. He was in the external prison ward, and I served in this office. We did not often talk, and Wu did not entrust me with any matters. Regarding Gu Zhuxuan's case, no one entrusted me to contact Ma Xianxiang to contact the prisoners to recant their testimony. Gu was in the external prison ward, and I was in this office. I have not met Gu, nor have I discussed anything with Gu's family. This is absolutely unjust. After a few months of litigation, I went home after being released on bail. I went to Ma Xianxiang's house to look for him, but he said he had not returned home. I did not know about Gu Zhuxuan's instigation to recant before. I did not know it until the prosecutor asked me when I was detained. I have not wronged Gu. If I had really done this, they would have all run away, and I would not have stayed here to eat litigation. When I was detained, I was still serving. The official said to Ma, according to Zhang Tinggui's confession, Ma Xianxiang said to him that Gu Zhuxuan entrusted Wu Zhongren to entrust you, and then entrusted Ma Xianxiang to contact Zhang. Do you admit this? If Zhang could not go out of the prison, how could he know so much in detail and say that you were involved? There must be a reason. Ma replied that they were talking nonsense. What evidence is there? At this point, Zhang Tinggui was brought to the case. He was asked if he knew Ma. Zhang replied that he did not know him. He asked Ma again, do you know Zhao Guangfu? He replied that he had guarded Zhao before, so he knew him. The official ordered Zhang to confess again how Ma Xianxiang contacted him to recant his testimony (the wording is the same as recorded in the previous newspaper). Ma still flatly denied that this had happened. Zhao Guangfu was then brought to the case and interrogated about the process of contacting him to recant his testimony in prison. Zhao's testimony was flickering and irrelevant, and it seemed quite ridiculous. The official questioned his previous confession and ordered him to confess again. Zhao said that many days had passed, and he had forgotten. Please check the files. The official then ordered Wu Lu to be brought to the case. Wu cried out for injustice and denied that he had been entrusted by Gu Zhuxuan to ask Ma Xianxiang to entrust him to recant his testimony. He also denied that he had been to Gu's house. He also claimed that there was another director surnamed He in the detention center who was a local and whose accent could not be distinguished from Wu. He asked for a detailed investigation. If there was any connection, he was willing to accept the punishment. At this point, Gu Songmao was brought to the case and interrogated about the deposit in the Daya Bank. He replied that he did not know. He asked, according to Zhang Tinggui's confession, Ma Xianxiang and you and Zheng Jianer went to the bank to deposit the money? He replied, please investigate again. If I went to deposit the money, then I cannot deny it. He asked, Gu Zhuxuan is your younger brother. You should find a way for him. If you deny it, is it possible that there are such good people outside who will pay to help your brother? He replied, I really did not go to deposit the money. There are many backgrounds to this case. There are anonymous letters to the court and the lawyers we hired, and Guo Tang Wu Mei, etc., which have been identified by the Third High Prosecutor as having the same handwriting. Please investigate secretly to extend the injustice. Since my brother was arrested, in addition to hiring lawyers to provide legal assistance, although someone called and asked to contact me, some did not say their names, and some set a location to find no one. Finally, Gu Zhuxuan was brought to the case and asked, Gu, you have been asked several times, and you have all denied it, but the bank deposit is real. He replied, I was in the external prison ward with someone guarding me and never left. I did not ask anyone to do it. I don't know who went to deposit this money inside. The Third High Court acquitted me. The verdict did not adopt the recanted words of Zhao and Zhang, but adopted the various evidence presented by my lawyer. I did not commit a crime. I would rather fight a lawsuit than buy their words. If I had listened to them, they would have only wanted a few hundred yuan from me at the beginning. I did not listen to them because there was no such thing. How could I then spend a huge amount of money to buy them? After the questioning, the court believed that the case still needed investigation and could not be closed. Therefore, it announced that it would be heard again at a later date. Gu Songmao and Ma Xianxiang were still released on bail, and the remaining people were still remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Hengli River Has Been Dredged <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai County's dredging of the Hengli River began on the 5th of this month with the construction of a dam. Yesterday, the flow was cut off. Qi Kezhong, the technical director of the county government, together with Zhang Fengshan, the head of the third district, and Wu Shifang, the head of the first district, hired a small boat yesterday to inspect the dam work. The river has not been repaired for 47 years, and the project is huge. The Puji Nursing Home has a water pavilion, and the water source is taken from Hengli. Therefore, two wooden river dams will be temporarily built in that section, and the construction of the Xiyin Port dam will be slowed down to provide for other projects. When the project is completed, it will be reduced and dredged again. The first and third district offices are now preparing for the lottery procedures. It will be divided into sections on the 10th, and excavation can begin on the 12th. As for the water lifting project, bidding has been open for many days, and there are many enthusiastic bidders. The bidding will be opened publicly in the county government auditorium at 1 pm tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Municipal North and North Shanghai Health Centers to Open <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>New Building Completed, Opening Date Selected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government considers health matters of utmost importance to the health of the nation. Passively, it can eliminate epidemics and reduce mortality, while actively, it can extend life and increase production. Therefore, it has established health centers in various districts to plan public health. Centers have already been established in Gaoqiao, Wusong, Jiangwan, and South Shanghai. However, the Zhabei area has been in poor sanitary condition since the January 28th Incident. Given the large population, it is necessary to establish a health institution. Mayor Wu, concerned about the health of the citizens, allocated 50,000 yuan from the municipal treasury to order Li Ting'an, the Director of the Health Bureau, to promptly establish a North Shanghai Health Center to protect the health of the citizens. After engaging Wang Binyan, Chen Bingqian, Wang Yunwu, Wang Peiyuan, Shen Yi, Lu Bohong, and Li Ting'an as preparation committee members, a site was selected on Qingyun Road in Zhabei, and construction began last spring. It is now completed. The health center is scheduled to open on November 1st. In addition to all administrative affairs, it will handle diagnosis and treatment, street cleaning and disinfection, maternal and child health, and infectious disease prevention. Impoverished citizens who seek medical treatment will receive free medication. There are also plans to establish public bathhouses to benefit the public. Once the entire center is completely organized, a formal opening ceremony will be held.</p>

Cao Zhigong then reported on association affairs, and Shen Zhongmou reported on financial matters. Subsequently, Mao Yun, representing the municipal party headquarters, and Lei Kenan, representing the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered speeches of encouragement.

All of the above proposals were passed. It was then decided to hold a vote for the election. As a result, Chu Minyi, Jia Yishan, and Dai Dongling were elected as supervisors, with Wang Fushen as an alternate.

<h3 id="e112">Real Estate Market Decline: Millionaire Becomes Impoverished, All Properties Sealed, Even Residence Cannot Be Preserved <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yang Qingsheng, a local resident and manager of Puyi Real Estate Company, who lived in the Fahua Town west of Shanghai for three years, previously had assets worth nearly ten million yuan. Unexpectedly, due to the collapse of the Meifeng Bank, Yang also collapsed, resulting in a millionaire becoming a penniless person. All of his properties were sealed by creditors. Only a residence in Fahua, valued at twenty to thirty thousand yuan, remained. He relied on renting it out to others for daily expenses. Unexpectedly, yesterday, at the request of creditors, the court sealed this residence as well. Recalling the scene in 1934 when his eldest grandson freely married a famous courtesan, Yifei Laoliu, Yang opposed the marriage and did not allow him to inherit the property, resulting in his grandson and Yifei committing suicide by shooting themselves. The lawsuits in the Chinese and French courts were vastly different from today. The speed of the downfall is truly unimaginable.</p>

All members deeply understand righteousness and enthusiastically contribute. We have now raised over 100,000 kits, exceeding the original target.

<p>And Requests Assistance from Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Association held a joint meeting of its executive directors and supervisors yesterday. Lin Die, Peng Shengtian, Xie Denan, Zhang Xiqi, Wu Yingpei, Wu Jishun, Cui Tongde, and newly returned directors from Southeast Asia Lin Shudeng, Li Weiguang, and others attended. Lin Die chaired the meeting, and Chen Luqin recorded the minutes. After the chairman's report, the issue of assisting Suiyuan was raised. It was generally agreed that the current situation in Suiyuan was more serious than during the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, and that a simple donation would not be sufficient. A large-scale organization and a long-term plan were necessary to achieve the goal of resisting aggression and saving the nation. The discussion lasted for two hours, and it was resolved that, in addition to sending condolences to the frontline soldiers and requesting overseas Chinese to donate funds for assistance, further efforts should be made to ensure that overseas Chinese with military experience or special skills and the determination to sacrifice themselves for the country could fulfill their wishes. However, this matter was of great importance and could not be achieved without a meticulous plan. Therefore, the association was being cautious and would not announce it until the appropriate time. The telegram sent to Yan Xishan and Fu Zuoyi is recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to Yan and Fu: Taiyuan Vice Chairman Yan and Guisui Chairman Fu, Greetings. The puppet troops and Mongolian bandits are acting as accomplices, invading with all their forces, and the flames of war are raging. Fortunately, you have led your troops to fiercely suppress them. Wherever your banners go, the enemy's cavalry is routed. General Fei descended from the sky, and Bailing Temple was recaptured. The news of the victory spread far and wide, and the whole country rejoiced. Sui and Chahar are the throat of North China. The gains and losses of a corner affect the overall situation. It is hoped that you will exert your heroic power, advance with your halberds, annihilate the ugly enemies, and secure our borders. The members of this association vow to be your backup. In addition to sending telegrams to overseas Chinese in various regions, urging them to donate funds for assistance, we hereby send our condolences. Please take note. The Overseas Chinese Association bows.</p>
<p>Telegram to Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>To all General Chambers of Commerce, Guild Halls, Schools, Newspaper Offices, and all Overseas Chinese, Greetings. The puppet troops and Mongolian bandits are acting as accomplices, unleashing their poison flames, and invading the territory of Suiyuan. Our government and soldiers defending the territory are learning from the fall of the Eastern Provinces and Rehe, punishing the past and preventing future occurrences, and have resolved to be jade fragments rather than broken tiles. They have sent troops to meet the enemy and are fighting bloody battles in the Yin Mountains. In recent months, thanks to the command and control of our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, his calm response, the presence of Vice Chairman Yan Xishan in the north, his meticulous planning, the strict military orders of Chairman Fu, his skilled command, and the spirited efforts of the soldiers at the front, the enemy has been intimidated wherever the banners have gone. Within a dozen days of the clash, Bailing Temple, an important location in Inner Mongolia, has been taken back from the enemy. Now the army is still pursuing and driving north, hoping to annihilate the ugly enemies and celebrate a complete victory. Sui and Chahar are the key to the northern part of our country. Historically, the success or failure of the invasion by the Northern barbarians has always depended on the gains and losses of this area. If they win, they will graze their horses southwards. If they lose, they will flee to the desert. The bandits are using the old tricks of the puppet background, attempting to annex North China and sweep across the Central Plains. We cannot simply give it away. However, since the war has begun, it cannot be calmed down overnight, and there is a risk of expansion at any time. For a long-term war of resistance, it is necessary to unite the strength of 450 million compatriots. It will be difficult to preserve the country and the nation. The people of the country are angered by the barbarity of the strong enemy and mourn the destruction of the country. All are of one mind in hatred of the enemy, emptying their pockets and opening their chests. From high officials to prisoners, all are doing their best and showing their sincere patriotism. Our overseas Chinese are concerned about the motherland and have always been enthusiastic. We hope that they will rise up quickly and provide organized and sustained assistance, so that the strong enemy can be crushed, the country can be protected, and our descendants of Yan and Huang will not be cut off by the enemy. How fortunate would that be! Looking south at the sea and sky, we cannot express our feelings enough. We are sending this urgent telegram, and we hope that you will take note. The Overseas Chinese Association bows.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Two New Vessels Purchased by Sanbei Company Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Suitable for Both Flood and Shallow Waters</p>
<p>Due to the improvement of the Yangtze River shipping industry this year, the Sanbei Company found that its original vessels were insufficient to meet demand. Furthermore, as the river level fell, ships with deeper drafts were obstructed. Therefore, the company purchased one Longshan and one Ruian vessel from Hong Kong and Macau Steamboat Company. Another large vessel was also purchased. After the vessels were purchased, Xie Shunmao, Assistant Manager, and Pao Shi, Chief Captain, along with all 86 crew members, were sent to Hong Kong on the 11th of last month to bring the two new vessels to Shanghai. The Longshan was renamed Longxing, and the Ruian was renamed Long'an. Xie Shunmao has transferred to the Yuehan Railway to inspect the Yangtze River shipping industry in Hunan. Pao Shi led the two new vessels from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the Longxing arrived in Shanghai first. The Long'an had to wait until night to reach Wusong and will enter the port this morning. Both vessels have a carrying capacity of 1,500 tons each, and their construction is excellent. They were both completed in 1935, have shallow drafts, and have a large cargo capacity and excellent passenger accommodations. They are most suitable for the Yangtze River and can travel in both flood and shallow waters. Upon arrival in Shanghai, the two vessels will be driven to the Sanbei Machinery Factory for repairs. At the same time, they will be reported to the Maritime Affairs Bureau for registration, obtain navigation licenses, and change the national flag. As soon as the work is completed, they will be assigned to the Yangtze River to operate.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Zhejiang Silk Control Association Borrows Money to Improve Silk Cocoons <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, in order to meet the needs of various regions and develop the silk industry, the Zhejiang Silk Control Association has decided to purchase more spring silkworm seeds and distribute them to various breeding areas. However, the domestic production of spring silkworm seeds in recent years has been insufficient to supply all regions. Therefore, the association has borrowed 400,000 yuan from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to order 800,000 sheets of spring silkworm seeds from abroad to supplement the shortage. The price per sheet is 0.75 yuan, totaling 600,000 yuan. In addition to borrowing 400,000 yuan from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, the remaining 200,000 yuan will be supplemented from the profits of selling spring silkworm silk this year. The seed purchase loan contract has been signed, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications each providing 200,000 yuan at an interest rate of 9%, with the purchased silkworm seeds as collateral, and stipulates that the principal and interest will be repaid in full when the spring cocoons are put on the market next year.</p>
<p>Improving Cocoon-Drying Equipment in Cocoon Shops</p>
<p>The association has recognized that the improved varieties of cocoons raised in recent years are of good quality. In order to further improve and increase production, it has decided to improve the old-fashioned cocoon stoves in various cocoon shops and uniformly adopt new-style cooperative cocoon dryers to save manpower and time. It has agreed with the Bank of China to borrow 600,000 yuan to order 20 new machines and order various cocoon shops to use them. The loan is secured by the machines purchased by the cocoon shops and their income, and the Silk Control Association provides a second guarantee. The cocoon shops in Zhejiang Province have now registered with the association to purchase the machines. It is expected that they will be purchased and distributed to various cocoon shops when the spring cocoons are put on the market next year.</p>
<p>Incentives to Increase Seed Production</p>
<p>The association has also recognized that there has been a shortage of domestic silkworm seeds in recent years. If measures are not taken to increase seed production as soon as possible, not only will there be more panic in the future, but ordering from abroad when there is a shortage of silkworm seeds will result in more losses and outflow of profits. This must be remedied urgently. It is now negotiating with the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Industry to borrow 200,000 yuan to provide to various seed breeding farms for expansion of equipment, so that production can be increased in the future to meet the needs of rural areas in various regions. The Agricultural and Commercial Bureau has agreed in principle to the loan and has sent personnel to Hangzhou for investigation. It is expected that a formal contract will be signed soon, and the matter will be handled.</p>

From February 1, 1937, they will be officially discontinued and will no longer be used. However, if the public has any unused stamps at that time, they will be allowed to exchange them for new-version ordinary stamps of the same value (i.e., stamps with the portraits of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and revolutionary martyrs) at various post offices within six months after the discontinuation (i.e., from February 1, 1937, to July 31, 1937). After the deadline, no exchange will be allowed." According to this order, the list of old-version stamps, postcards, and postal stationery is listed below for public information.

<h3 id="e121">Sun Hengfu Sued for Damaging Creditor Rights by Riding in His Son's Car: Nai Zi Owes Baoshen Bank Debts and Transferred the Car to His Father, Resulting in the Lawsuit <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Sun Xianggui, the former director of the Ningbo Siming Bank, is the son of Sun Hengfu, the former general manager of Siming Bank. In 1931, when Sun was in office, he had dealings with the Yongdi Baoshen Bank. As a result, he owed the bank 27,500 yuan. Because Sun delayed repayment, He Lianguan, the manager of the bank, hired lawyer Xu Jie in Shanghai to file a lawsuit for delay, which has been decided, and Sun has lost the case. He then filed a lawsuit for enforcement. During the enforcement process, Sun repeatedly failed to appear, and the enforcement court issued a warrant for his arrest, but he was not apprehended. Baoshen Bank also published advertisements in various newspapers seeking Sun's whereabouts, offering 500 yuan as a reward, but to no avail. He Lianguan has now learned that Sun Xianggui had a car with license plate number 98, which was suddenly transferred to his father, Sun Hengfu, to ride in. This is a violation of Article 355 of the Criminal Law, damaging creditor rights. Therefore, He hired lawyer Xu to file a criminal lawsuit in the First Special Court, requesting that he be punished as deserved. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan Zhenyang opened the Fifth Criminal Court for interrogation. Sun Xianggui did not appear. His wife hired lawyer Yuan Hanyun to appear in court, stating that Sun had gone blind after his business failed and had gone to Japan for treatment. According to his telegram, he cannot appear in court. He Lianguan then submitted a statement of the case, stating that although the loan was only over 27,000 yuan, it would amount to over 40,000 yuan including interest. Although the defendant has status, it is difficult to ascertain his assets. Even a car has been transferred to his father. And the subpoena from your court to Sun Hengfu was entrusted to the defendant for delivery, but the defendant's family claimed not to know this person. How can a son not know his father? Lawyer Yuan completely acknowledged the loan between the defendant and the plaintiff but stated that the defendant's car was a Dodge and was mortgaged to Hengxun Bank last year. This car is now being ridden by Yu Zuoting, and the license plate has been changed to number 4614, while Sun Hengfu's car license plate was originally number 4271. Because his son's car was sold, he took the 98 license plate back for his own use. Therefore, there was no damage to creditor rights. Plaintiff's lawyer Xu Jie believed that Yuan's claim was inconsistent and submitted a reply from the Vehicle Management Office to the court. Judge Pan checked the report and ordered a postponement for investigation and further interrogation. He also notified lawyer Yuan to order the defendant to appear in court.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day before yesterday, Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession learned that someone was secretly manufacturing the poisonous Qin Xing brand red pills at 171 Thistledew Lane for sale in the city. At 11 o'clock at noon, they went to the address to search and arrested the manufacturers, Min native Yang Mingxuan (25 years old), Yang Alai (28 years old), and Nanjing native Zhou Jinrong (24 years old), among others. They confiscated 117 red pills, over ten pounds of raw materials, and a complete set of handmade red pill equipment and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Sun Pengxian interrogated them.

<p>On the afternoon of August 13, 1931, at 6 p.m., a case of Jiangbei bandits killing their own kind occurred in the Fasheng Inn on Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession. Jiang Zhonghan, Xia Yongsheng, and a man surnamed Xue were killed, and Zhong Ziqing was injured. Later, the French police arrested a suspect named Yan Jinbiao. He was sentenced to death by the Second Special Court, and the verdict was final. The original sentence was carried out according to law. During the interrogation, Yan confessed that the mastermind was Li Guocheng from Funing, also known as Chen Youliang. In January 1933, Li was handed over to the Public Security Bureau by Yan's family in Rihui Port. After the Second Special Court brought him back for trial, he was also sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life. Li refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Third High Court, but the appeal was rejected. Li then appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent the case back for retrial. On July 6 of the previous year, the Third High Court changed the sentence to life imprisonment. Li still refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court again. Now, the Supreme Court has reviewed the case and determined that there has been a general amnesty, but the original trial did not mention it. Therefore, it has revoked the original sentence and sent it back to the Third High Court for another retrial. Yesterday afternoon, presiding judge Wu Tingqi, along with judges Liao and Wang, and prosecutor Dong, presided over the retrial in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Fei Xizhen appeared in court on behalf of the French Police Department. After the court questioned the appellant Li Guocheng about the case and the reasons for the appeal, it ordered the opening of the debate. The debate was concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 2 p.m. on the 12th. The appellant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>At the Xie Tai Grain Store at No. 157 Zhoujiazui Road, four robbers suddenly arrived at around 8 p.m. last night. Two robbers were wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants, and the other two were wearing overcoats. They broke into the store, two robbers guarded the back door, and the other robbers took out pistols, scaring everyone into silence. They robbed more than 70 yuan in legal tender from the counter and fled out the door. The store staff, after the robbers had left, immediately shouted "Robbery!" and frantically blew the police whistle. Two Chinese police officers from Nos. 1231 and 377 nearby heard the sound and rushed over, seeing four robbers running away in front. The two police officers immediately chased after them. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest, and the police officers also returned fire. The chase reached the intersection of Rue Auca, and three more police officers, Nos. 3055, 53, and 1913, joined in the pursuit. They worked together to subdue one of the robbers wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants. He was shot several times and died on the spot. The remaining robbers continued to open fire to resist arrest and fled east. The police officers bravely stepped forward and captured one robber, while the other two robbers escaped without a trace. At the time, a passerby named Zhou Keming from Rugao, who was pulling a rickshaw, was hit in the right leg by a stray bullet and was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by a police car. The captured robber was taken to the police station in charge for investigation. The body of the killed robber was sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

<h3 id="e137">A New Development in the Future of National Products <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>—Planning to Establish a National Products Joint Venture Company</p>
<p>In the midst of the arduous and enthusiastic promotion of the national products movement, there has recently been a new development in the future of our national products.</p>
<p>This new development is that the National Economic Construction Movement Committee in Nanjing recently brought together government banks and the China National Products Production and Sales Association to plan the establishment of a nationwide national products joint venture company with a capital of two million yuan. Recently, national products magnates from Shanghai went to Nanjing to discuss the matter with Director Wu. Subsequently, the association announced the formation of a preparatory committee of 39 people to actively carry out the preparations, laying the foundation for the national economic construction of our country and the initial revitalization of national industry. In the current situation, it also demonstrates the government's determination to maintain domestic products and the achievements of the national products sector over the years!</p>
<p>Originally, due to the rise of the national national products movement in recent years, the self-awareness of the general industrial sector has been promoted, and they have all engaged in the development of the national products industry. Not only has the number of national products factories increased, but also national products companies, national products stores, and national products malls have been established like a rising wind and surging clouds in various places. However, its only defect is that there is no national national products sales headquarters to systematically control, improve, and expand them. Therefore, the government and the national industrial sector have joined hands to establish this joint venture company in order to overcome the past phenomenon of being scattered and acting independently, so that the future of national products will have new developments and promote the national government's main task of managing national production and sales.</p>
<p>Although, at this time, we still hope that the national products sector will make its own efforts to improve its products and increase production quantities, and that the government will effectively reward those who promote the sales of national products, reduce transportation costs and taxes, so that national products will sell better. This is an important prerequisite in the process of implementing the national national products production and sales network.</p>
<p>In short, in the past, the center of our national products movement was often focused on empty words and verbal propaganda, but now we have further strived to practically establish a national planned and organized production and sales mechanism. This spirit of progressive overall planning reflects that the future of our national products has a new development. We must continue this spirit, encourage ourselves to progress, and create a greater and more glorious future for national products!</p>
<h3 id="e138">National Products Sector and the Industrial Association Law <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Industry has drafted three types of association laws: the Commercial Association Law, the Industrial Association Law, and the Export Association Law. After five or six months of discussion and more than ten meetings, the draft was finally completed and submitted to the Executive Yuan for consultation and transmission to the Legislative Yuan for approval. The comprehensiveness and prudence of the formulation of our country's industrial and commercial association laws this time is the greatest. The pain that our national products sector has felt over the years is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Unnecessary competition among the same industry, mutual killing.</p>
<p>(2) Each factory has its own way of collecting raw materials, manufacturing technology, and promotion methods, without contact with each other.</p>
<p>(3) The organization among the same industry often presents a scattered and complex state, even overlapping and creating extra branches, losing the function of control.</p>
<p>(4) Due to the lack of contact among the same industry on weekdays, there is a lack of research on business, guidance on technology, and all statistical surveys are lacking. The prosperity and decline of the same industry is not easy to understand.</p>
<p>This draft of the Industrial Association Law is aimed at these drawbacks. It strives for the improvement and development of industry, corrects past shortcomings, and takes cooperation as its main purpose. Common purchase of raw materials and cooperative management of warehouses and transportation are all essential elements for the future development of the industrial sector. It is hoped that the national products sector will earnestly study the draft formulated by the Ministry of Industry, and make statements as far as experience allows, for the government's reference. Legislation is one thing, and facts are another. Whether legal principles and facts can adapt and whether they can be implemented without creating difficulties all require empirical consideration. Our industrial sector is most closely related to this and should pay attention to it urgently.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Remember November 11th <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Ru</p>
<p>Please refer to issue 193 of this publication. I am pleased to learn that the Shanghai Women's National Products Consumption Association was officially established on November 11th. The women's sector is the master of consumption, especially the housewives in the family, who have sole control over family consumption. The great power of such a leading organization is of course immeasurable. It is hoped that the members who join the association will adopt Mr. Yu Yushu's contribution, practice what they preach, and engage in widespread publicity in social gatherings to expand the organization. Not only will national products manufacturers receive assistance, but the country's economic lifeline can be saved a lot.</p>
<p>I secretly believe that the establishment of this association? Those who engaged in choosing November 11th certainly did some research, containing extremely profound meaning, which we must recognize. National products are local products, this is known to everyone. The two characters "eleven" stacked on top of each other are exactly the character "soil" [土]. November 11th is "soil" "soil", implying that members who join the association, when purchasing and using goods, should not forget "soil" goods, and hope that national products factories, when purchasing raw materials, should first choose "soil" goods for procurement, a double major meaning. Okay, whether you are a member or not, everyone remember November 11th, everyone don't forget local products and soil goods, then national products will naturally develop, and the leak can be plugged, so that we will not fail the auspicious day and time of the establishment of this association.</p>

<p>The Nanyang Commercial Investigation Group plans to establish a joint office in Singapore, which will be organized by the two group leaders, Gao and Hu.</p>
<p>Li Xinpu and others from the Family Industry Cooperative went to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Industry, requesting that the organization be expanded for the joint venture company and that candidates be widely selected for the preparatory committee. After the Changsha National Products Company resumed business, its business volume reached more than 440,000 yuan in January.</p>
<p>Dong Shaosheng, chairman of the Sichuan National Products Company, came to Shanghai to discuss expanding business.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Clean and Inexpensive National Product Stoves <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Sheng</p>
<p>The north wind has risen and the cold has struck. Stoves are truly a blessing in the home, and are essential for those above the middle class. What kind of stove is the best and most suitable for our ideal conditions on the market now? This is also a common sense that should be possessed when winter comes.</p>
<p>Recently, clean and inexpensive stoves have appeared on the market, which can eliminate the drawbacks of old stoves and revolutionize the fate of old stoves. There are several ways in which they are completely different from old-style stoves:</p>
<p>(1) The stove door has only one - because there is no need to add coal or hook out ashes, there is no need for multiple doors, only one air door is enough. After the fire is lit, this air door is also tightly closed, so there is no smoke or ash all day long, and the room is naturally clean. (Old-style doors have three or four, and must be opened from time to time, with smoke and ash filling the air, which is extremely annoying)</p>
<p>(2) The flue is smaller - the coal burned in ordinary stoves does not provide enough air, and most of it turns into smoke and carbon, which is scattered in the air, making the air turbid, and accumulating in the pipe, causing the flue to become clogged. Therefore, the flue must be large. The coal used in clean stoves is specially made and burns completely, so there is very little soot. The flue does not need to be too large, and the heat is not leaked outwards, which can save coal and expenses.</p>
<p>(3) Specially made coal crystals - the advantages of coal crystals are (A) only one is used per day, and the remaining ash does not break after burning, but remains in one piece and can be easily removed, (B) clean, with no ash or smoke, as mentioned above, (C) there are three sizes of coal crystals. If you want to increase the heat, you can use the large size. If you want to save money, you can use the medium and small sizes, which are very flexible, (D) they do not take up much space. The coal crystals are the same size and can be stacked in the corner of the wall, only two or three feet is enough, unlike loose coal, which requires a large amount, takes up a lot of space, and is messy all over the ground.</p>
<p>(4) Can be used for two purposes - institutions or large families who burn coal stoves in the kitchen all day and all year round to get boiling water or cook dishes can use this stove instead, with no added cost and more convenience.</p>
<p>(5) Even heat - ordinary stoves, when adding coal, the heat drops sharply, and when the fire is lit, the heat is too high. Uneven cold and heat often leads to sore throats or colds, and children are prone to getting sick. Clean stoves use coal crystals, so the heat is uniform all day long, and there is no sudden rise or fall in heat, which is beneficial to health and is very important.</p>
<p>Other things such as the elegance of the stove style and the low price are secondary matters. It is heard that this stove was designed by a professor at Central University, referring to the latest foreign-style stoves, and after several improvements, it was finally launched on the market and will soon be available.</p>

<p>— Special Report by This Newspaper, Investigation by Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>Starting in 1935, the school medical office specially set up three free trachoma treatment centers, with ten consultation sessions per week. Students in each school can take turns to receive treatment twice a week. During the winter and summer vacations, the number of consultations for trachoma treatment is increased to allow more students with trachoma to receive treatment. In total, last year, 1,598 students in the five Chinese children's elementary schools suffered from mild to severe trachoma. The total number of consultations throughout the year was 24,146. 272 students were completely cured. The condition of 179 students gradually improved, which is satisfactory. 250 students who had recovered were re-examined. 72 students relapsed after being cured. The reason for the relapse is due to the lack of emphasis on public health in the family.</p>
<p>For students who have contracted infectious diseases, serious illnesses, or other minor illnesses, in addition to notifying their parents to seek medical treatment, the school medical office also sends school nurses to visit the sick students' homes to find out whether the students' parents have sought medical treatment for their children. This kind of visiting work is quite valuable; on the one hand, it can clarify the situation of students receiving medical treatment at home, and on the other hand, it can persuade and urge parents to pay attention to and implement the work of maintaining children's health. The following table shows the records of school nurses visiting students' families, which also shows the value of this work.</p>
<p>First visit to students' families 2,523 people</p>
<p>Students' parents have carried out various medical treatments 1,075 people</p>
<p>Students' parents have not taken any action 1,448 people</p>
<p>Second visit to students' families 2,395 people</p>
<p>Students' parents have carried out various medical treatments 1,425 people</p>
<p>Students' parents have not taken any action 970 people</p>
<p>Third visit to students' families 1,957 people</p>
<p>Students' parents have carried out various medical treatments 1,268 people</p>
<p>Students' parents have not taken any action 689 people</p>
<p>Special visit to students' families during the holidays 458 people</p>
<p>Students' parents have carried out various medical treatments 401 people</p>
<p>Students' parents have not taken any action 57 people</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, it can be seen that the tendency of parents not taking action for children's diseases has gradually decreased; this can also prove that, as a result of school nurses visiting students' families, students' parents have paid attention to the health of children in school.</p>
<p>Thirteen. Family Liaison</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council elementary schools usually welcome parents to come to the school for talks. During each semester, each school holds a grade-level reception for parents to have talks, and teachers from each school take turns to receive parents of each grade to come to the school for talks. In this kind of talk, teachers and parents can exchange views on the personality, physical and psychological condition of the children, as well as various opinions on raising children. Teachers can also take this opportunity to give parents the children's usual homework results and ten-week test results for viewing, so that parents can understand the children's academic situation in school. According to the school authorities, this kind of grade-level reception for parents to have talks is of great help to the communication and liaison between school and family.</p>

<h3 id="e161">This Sunday's Schedule for the Chinese Football Association (Note: The Shanghai and HSBC match has been rescheduled) <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The schedule for the Chinese Football Association this Sunday (December 13) is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e162">Team League Tournament, First Match of the China Youth vs. Race Club, China Youth Wins by 59 Points in Total After Two Matches <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Air Rifle Team League tournament between the China Youth Association and the Race Club was changed to be held at the Race Club at 5:30 pm yesterday. There were a total of two matches: (1) Ding Mingyi of China Youth vs. Marshall of Race Club, the result was that China Youth unfortunately lost by 16 points; (2) Yan Xiangguan of China Youth vs. Touyi, China Youth won by 75 points. In conclusion, China Youth won by 59 points more. Today, starting at 5:30 pm, Bao Qiyun of China Youth will play against Stomi of the Race Club, and Fang Yide will play against Harold Pepper.</p>
<p>When the first match between the first players of both sides ended, Marshall of the Race Club won by a total of 16 points. The general audience and Marshall deeply regretted Ding's defeat, because the wonderfulness of his skill performance cannot be buried by his failure. Ding scored 27 points in the first shot, followed by the second shot, and continued to hit, scoring 54 points. When the red bullet happened to be next to the hole, a slight push would guarantee a hit, but he lost Jingzhou due to carelessness, giving the other side an endless opportunity. Marshall, the first-class figure in the A group competition, seized the opportunity when good luck came and advanced rapidly. In an instant, he scored 64 points in one shot. Marshall reversed from being more than 60 points behind and surpassed him, winning 78 points with a ratio of 282 to 204. The result of only losing 16 points for worker Ding who concentrated on fighting and scored 45 points in one shot and then 17 points was due to this last effort. Marshall's highest record was 64, 32, 25, Ding's was 27, 54, 45.</p>
<p>Touyi of the 5th Race Club was steady in his shots, and his opening power was excellent, but his average development was not as good as that of Yan Xiangguan of China Youth. From beginning to end, Yan was firmly on top, resulting in a 300 to 225 victory, winning 75 points. The highest record was Yan's 23, 37, 24, 25.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Grain and Flour See Strong Buying Interest - Opening Prices for Each Month Nearly Rise to the One Corner Limit - Although Retreating Midway, Prices Ultimately Remain Firm and High <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw unabated frenzy from the opening bell. Prices for all months rose almost to the one corner limit, threatening another standstill. The bullish performance gave the impression of disregard for all else. When the opening prices were quoted, foreign wheat prices had already risen by two or three jiao, so the price for the current month jumped by six or seven fen. As a result, the price for January rose by one jiao, and trading came to a standstill. Unexpectedly, there was a reaction after the second session, as both bulls took profits and factories dumped large quantities, causing the market to gradually loosen. Except for the current month, prices for all months fell by six, seven, or eight fen, showing significant fluctuations. At the opening of the afternoon session, fluctuations for the current month were not significant, but news spread that Tianjin's spot flour prices were good, reviving buying interest. Once trading resumed, prices rebounded by three or five fen compared to the morning close. Given the unstable environment, it is feared that the turbulence will not subside easily.</p>
<h3 id="e170">The Wheat Futures Market Sees a Dangerous Situation at High Prices - Trading Halted in the Morning Due to Unpaid Margin Calls - Afternoon Trading Sees Minor Fluctuations - Spot Wheat Prices Rise Again by More Than One Corner <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The wheat futures market halted trading yesterday morning because margin calls had not been fully paid. Trading resumed as usual in the afternoon. As the opening prices were announced, the erratic nature of the flour market led to active trading but smaller fluctuations. Although there was no reason for prices to fall in the current market turmoil, people inevitably became wary due to the high prices. As a result, the final prices for each month rose by only one, two, three, or four fen. Spot wheat prices rose by more than one corner across the board. Kai Gao You Wheat was quoted at 6 yuan 6 jiao, settling at 5 jiao 3 fen; Guan Dian Wheat at 6 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen, settling at 4 jiao 4 fen; Dao Ren Qiao Wheat at 6 yuan 5 jiao 3 fen, settling at 4 jiao 5 fen; Shaoxing Wheat at 6 yuan 9 jiao; Huaian Wheat at 6 yuan 5 jiao; and Anqing Wheat at 6 yuan 5 jiao, settling at 4 jiao 5 fen. Fufeng sold 8,000 bags.</p>

<p>(Shanghai North) Although eleven or twelve boats arrived from Nanpu yesterday, over 200 boats were detained in the Jiwangmiao area of Jiading County and have not been released, causing unease. As a result, rice prices have risen by one, two, three, or four jiao. Yesterday afternoon, leaders of the rice industry association took official documents to the Zhenjiang Provincial Government to request that Jiading County release the boats, which calmed the public and stabilized market prices slightly. Yesterday, the price of white japonica rice rose by one or two jiao, while Bianyuan rice soared by three or four jiao. Yangdujian rice rose by two jiao, while Baodao rice tightened by one jiao, and Kejian rice also tightened by one jiao. The prices of all other types of rice also increased.</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the supply from various origins was slightly scarce, with a total of over seventy boats arriving, carrying 14,300 to 14,400 dan of cargo. Baodao rice accounted for nearly fifty boats, and buying interest continued, though not as brisk as in the previous market. However, the market was still good, with a total of over 6,000 bags of Baodao rice from Pingjin, Qingyan, and other origins being sold, and prices rising by two jiao. Over 4,000 bags of thick japonica rice were sold, with prices rising by about two jiao. However, considering the overall trend, the large volume of sales recently can be attributed to the baozi (steamed bun) market, so changes in the thick and thin japonica rice markets depend on this shift. Duyangjian also increased by one or two jiao, and Yinyuan also showed improvement, increasing by different amounts.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Imported Rice Prices Remain Firm <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>--Customer Xian Rice Sales are Particularly Brisk… The Market Rises Again by More Than One Corner—</p>
<p>Yesterday, customer xian rice digestion remained strong. In addition to continuous sales from both northern and southern customer merchants, local merchants and stockpilers also gradually became active. Due to the detention of river rice and the overall soaring of grain prices, the local spot sales and stockpilers' spirits were boosted. Customer merchants were still actively selling northern rice from Henan and other places, as well as Shantou rice, and newly added Quanzhou rice was also actively sold. Guangdong merchants had no intention of continuous active sales due to the supply of Hunan rice and the tax exemption on imported rice. Although there were transactions yesterday, they were only token. However, after continuous sales from customer stockpilers and local merchants, with a daily volume of 16,000 bags, people's confidence has been boosted. Yesterday, the market continued to rise by one jiao to one jiao five or six fen. The total daily sales included 545 bags of Jiangxi rice, 2,911 bags of Hunan rice, 500 bags of Han brown rice, 2,150 bags of Wentaiyong rice, 300 bags of Jiangbei rice. Imported rice prices remained high. Yesterday, foreign merchants reported that Saigon rice was priced at 14.5 yuan per tael in Shanghai, and broken rice, after full taxation, would also cost 13 yuan three or four jiao.</p>

<p>The soybean market advanced amid the volatile rise in Dalian. Currently, the supply from the Northeast is inevitably reduced, and wheel soybeans are not abundant. Therefore, people are very excited. Yesterday, the oil mills bought 1,200 bags of Tancheng soybeans, with the price opening at 5 yuan and 9 jiao. Tongliao soybeans also opened at 5 yuan and 9 jiao, with five cars traded. In addition, Guangsha, Minshan, local merchants, and others purchased 2,000 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans, 300 to 400 bags of Wanjiang Chi soybeans, one car of Sipingjie soybeans, 200 bags of Hankou Man soybeans, one hundred of Niuzhuang Xiaoye soybeans, 500 bags of Xiashi soybeans, and ninety bags of Chongming Sha soybeans. Prices all soared by five or six fen.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Yarn and Cotton - This Month's Yarn Futures Return to Ten Yuan Below the Highest Price - Rumors of Qingdao Labor Unrest Being Resolved - Many Long Positions Have Been Mostly Liquidated <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>After the sharp rise in the yarn market, a sudden reversal occurred, with a dramatic decline. In fact, the daily rapid rise was too large, making this kind of sharp decline unsurprising. This newspaper anticipated that it would fall ten yuan below the peak, and this month's futures have now fallen ten yuan. However, the spot yarn market is dull, as the end of the year is approaching, and business may experience a period of quiet. However, major players have not given up on absorbing inventory.</p>
<p>Prices for Futures in Each Month Fall</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for standard yarn saw tight conditions for December, rising by six jiao. Upon trading in the January futures, the market sentiment suddenly reversed, with a selling wave emerging. This was due to the Qingdao yarn factory's resumption of work issue, which was expected to be resolved satisfactorily, leading to a more bearish sentiment. At the second session opening, the December futures plummeted by three yuan and five jiao, and the distant months fell by another one yuan six or seven jiao. At the same time, spot yarn trading was sluggish, and the situation remained weak. As a result, each month fell by two yuan and five jiao to four yuan and four jiao compared to the previous day's close. At the afternoon opening, major players were still buying near-term contracts, while floating accounts continued to sell distant months, softening the market further. The market situation remained peaceful thereafter, with most long positions being liquidated and a large amount being sold. Market prices gradually declined. As a result, each month fell by another five jiao to one yuan two jiao compared to the morning close. 2,150 bales were sold by Dayi, 2,200 bales by Minde, 5,500 bales by Hexing, 1,250 bales by Gengfeng, 2,350 bales by Wang Taixing, 3,000 bales by Dachangcheng, 1,050 bales by Minghua, 500 bales by Yicheng, and 750 bales by Xiecheng. On the buying side, Yiji bought 1,150 bales, Meiji bought 1,100 bales, Tongji bought 1,000 bales, Jinchang bought 1,700 bales, Taichang bought 2,200 bales, Yichang bought 2,050 bales, Xincheng bought 2,500 bales, and Senkang bought 1,950 bales, Dachang bought 1,150 bales, and Shenji bought 650 bales. A comparison of market prices is given below:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Turn Quiet</p>
<p>A total of 619 bales were bought by various merchants throughout the day, with selling prices falling by two or three yuan. The buying amounts of various merchants are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e175">Indian Cotton Prices Gradually Converge - Cotton Merchants Sell on Rallies - In Light of the Sharp Rise in Flour and Wheat, Cotton Futures Also Want to Go Long <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is sluggish, but in light of the sharp rise in flour and wheat prices, people outside the industry also see cotton prices rising, resulting in a large amount of speculative buying. However, the overseas cotton market is unusually dull, so most traders adopt a "sell on rallies" strategy.</p>
<p>Cotton Prices Ease as Soon as They Rise</p>
<p>Pre-market opening for standard cotton saw continued high prices in the near months. Due to the surge in flour and wheat prices, gold and securities merchants absorbed inventory and did not release it. However, upon trading in the distant months, traders, noting the lackluster overseas Indian and American cotton markets and the converging prices of Indian cotton, tended to sell, causing prices to fall. The second session saw a sharp drop of three, four, or five jiao. The third closing was uneventful. As a result, each month fell by one jiao to three jiao and a half compared to the previous day's close. At the afternoon opening, prices were nearly firm in the distant months. Most merchants who bought yarn and sold cotton had already hedged their positions, tightening the market slightly. The second and third sessions saw slight upward movement. By the close, traders were selling, causing distant months to fall back by two jiao and a half. As a result, each month rose or fell by five fen to one jiao compared to the morning close. Yongchang sold 1,500 dan, Yuda sold 2,300 dan, Gengyun sold 3,800 dan, Renfeng sold 4,300 dan, Xingchang sold 1,800 dan, Dachangcheng sold 3,800 dan, Yuanxingchang sold 4,800 dan, Yikang sold 2,100 dan, Dafeng sold 3,800 dan, Hexing sold 2,800 dan, Taixing sold 2,300 dan, and Taichang sold 1,300 dan. Yuan Yi bought 4,400 dan, Shenji bought 5,000 dan, Meiji bought 3,800 dan, Yichang bought 5,600 dan, Changfeng bought 3,800 dan, Runkang bought 4,700 dan, Shengyuan bought 2,800 dan, Hengchang bought 1,800 dan, and Xiecheng bought 1,300 dan. The daily market comparison is as follows:</p>

<p>The American cotton market opened yesterday with sluggish conditions. Traders are waiting for the government report to be released. The political situation in the UK prompted cotton farmers to hedge and foreign long positions to liquidate. However, the selling pressure was not strong, and all selling was absorbed by traders, resulting in mixed prices. Each month fell by two pounds to rise by two pounds. Judging from the market trend, it is largely firm, but lacking new stimulation. According to traders' predictions, there will be no major changes in the government report's harvest quantity. When the market closed, traders bought, and the market became firmer again. Spot prices rose by four points, and the near-term contract fell by three points to rise by five points. Spot English cotton fell by three points, and futures fell by one point. Individual buying of Indian cotton was overturned by cotton merchants' hedging. Pynguel fell by 0.25 rupees, Omra fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, and Balaras fell by 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (7th dispatch).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay dispatch, the opening forecast for the 8th was: Balaras at 219 rupees, Omra at 198 rupees, and Pynguel at 160.5 rupees, all up by 0.25 rupees.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cloth market saw slackened sentiment due to the report that the Qingdao factory's resumption of work issue would be resolved satisfactorily, and the counter-movement decline of standard yarn, regulated yarn, and thread. Fine cloth and fine twill's spot sales have already waned. Coarse cloth, coarse twill, velvet, zhigong, serge, and flannel prices remain firm because each factory's inventory is exhausted and incoming goods from inland factories are scarce. The selling market is gradually stabilizing, and it is still difficult to obtain goods. Tianjin merchants in the north road continue to show strong interest in buying, with transactions for over 500 pieces of goods, including white velvet, flannel, zhigong, serge, standard cloth, printed satin, zhigong, and serge. Goods to be delivered to the inland area in succession account for half of the transactions. Merchants from Henan, Sichuan, and the Yangtze River areas also made many transactions. Local and inland merchants are most actively trading colored cloth, velvet, heavy and light coarse cloth. Merchants from Fujian, who had been inactive for a long time, have gradually started buying again, while merchants from Guangdong and Yunnan have slackened their demand for all goods.</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a sudden decline in buying interest. Although pure gold rose, the opening was relatively stable, but it was only a fleeting phenomenon. Major players mostly liquidated their positions and gradually became bearish. Overseas silver markets, both British and American, were flat, and the forward silver price in Monte Rea contracted by one and a half to four points. Exchange rates rose slightly, and London spot gold rose by one and a half pence. The central bank's listed price announcement showed that both British and American prices were flat, the customs gold unit rose by two points, and the standard gold price was listed at 1155 yuan and four jiao. The off-market pre-trading opened, rising to 56 yuan due to slight buying by Jingfu and others. The morning opening was high, but major players continued to sell and became bearish. The mid-day trading fluctuated very little. HSBC's listed price announcement showed that both British and American prices were flat, and the silver balance tax announcement remained unchanged, gradually declining. Spot merchants took advantage of the low price to make small purchases and support the market. Later, the supply was limited, and the market fluctuated greatly at noon. The after-market was very quiet. Although spot merchants bought, it had little impact. As a result, it remained consistent with the standard price. The market conditions for the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1156 yuan, up three jiao from the previous closing. Yuen Feng, Yongde, and Xianghe sold off, reaching 5 yuan and four jiao. Hengyun, Yongjin, and Fengyong bought slightly, rising to 5 yuan and six jiao. Yuan Feng, Yongxing, Yongdade, and Chenglian sold in unison. HSBC's listed price announcement retreated to five yuan and two jiao. Tongfeng Silver Balance Tax remained unchanged, gradually moving downstream and retreating to five yuan and two jiao. Chen Yong, Shen Da Yong, Hong Chang Yong, and Qian Chang Xiang bought slightly, and Xianghe also bought, rising to five yuan and a half. Hengyu Tongyu Run sold off, retreating to five yuan and three jiao. Yuan Feng Yong bought again, and the noon closing was 1155 yuan and four jiao.</p>
<p>The after-market opening was 1155 yuan and a half. Although Tongfeng Heng bought, Yuan Feng and Yongyou had selling interest, and Hengyu also sold, retreating to five yuan and four jiao. The Indian silver exchange was fixed at a total of two ana, and the closing remained at 1155 yuan and four jiao.</p>
<p>The closing price was 1155 yuan and four jiao, following the central bank's standard gold price listing. The market was essentially flat, with the January ledger price at 1155 yuan and the morning replenishment at 1153 yuan. The spot market remained firm, with Tianjin goods quoted at an additional 13 yuan and a half, and Qichi's buying price at 11 yuan. There were no transactions.

<h3 id="e183">Japanese Merchants Jointly Buy East Exchange - British and American Exchange Rates are Flat <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The British and American exchange rates were flat yesterday due to bank settlements. The Japanese exchange rate was rumored to be weak. The morning external news stated that London's large accounts were flat in both near and distant terms. The New York silver market was unchanged, and the forward silver price in Montre Rei contracted by one and a half to four points. London spot gold rose by one and a half pence. The British exchange rate against the American exchange rate rose by one two five, the British exchange rate against the French exchange rate fell by three points, the American exchange rate against the British exchange rate rose by one eight seven five, and the American exchange rate against the French exchange rate rose by two five. The central bank's listed price announcement showed that both British and American exchange rates were flat, the customs gold unit rose by two points, and the foreign exchange market's morning opening stated that the selling price for the recent period was one shilling two pence five three two five, the American exchange rate twenty-nine yuan six seven five, up from the previous closing, with both British and American exchange rates flat. After the opening, Chinese merchants continued to sell, and Japanese companies jointly bought East Exchange. Foreign banks settled shillings and American dollars. The HSBC's list of rates of exchange shows British and American, as well as silver import taxes unchanged, and the market remains stable. Afterward, Japanese companies continue to buy East Exchange, but the trend is difficult to optimistically determine. In the later market, the exchange will come in from Chinese businesses, and the Banks are supporting it, and so the Eastern exchange is now tight, and even though Japanese businesses have bought later, the sellers are very active, the Indian silver has now closed at two ana, so the price has settled. The closing price recent buy price, British Exchange one shilling two pence five three one two five, American exchange twenty-nine yuan six eight seven five, counting the two British and American exchanges flat, Chinese sellers selling shillings and 10,000 British Pounds, and 100,000 US dollars, now let's record the details of the transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Securities - Government Bonds Suddenly Rise with a Strong Surge <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange, the government bond market was experiencing a robust uptrend. After a long period of consolidation, the situation eased slightly, and sentiment turned from fatigue to firmness. Major players were actively buying, and many retail investors followed suit. The market was bullish due to strong buying interest, and the trading floor also looked promising. However, under stable environmental and market conditions, the bond market is not expected to undergo drastic changes. Yesterday morning, the trend was firm from the opening, and major players were actively buying. Large amounts were absorbed for the 50, 35, and 16 bonds, but the 10 and 5 bonds saw selling. Prices rose uniformly by two jiao and a half to six jiao. The closing was lively, and the market continued to advance. Major players such as the 35 and 32 bonds remained strong buyers, while the 10 and 43 bonds saw selling. Except for the Class A bonds expiring next month, which fell slightly by one jiao, all other bonds continued to rise by one or two jiao. The afternoon opening saw a mixed market. Many retail investors switched to cash, and the 5 bond also saw rolling over. Bonds such as the Tong, Wu, and Bing bonds retreated by one or two jiao. However, later, the 58 and 34 bonds and others resumed absorbing inventory. The Class B bonds expiring next month and the Class A bonds rose again by five fen and one jiao, respectively. At the closing, the market on the trading floor continued to look promising. The 34, 11, and 10 bonds and others continued to purchase, while the 35 and 50 bonds released some inventory. Prices continued to be firm, rising by five fen to three jiao and a half. As a result, prices rose across the board by four or five jiao to nine jiao. The total transaction volume was 6.22 million yuan. The comparison of their rises, falls, and highs and lows is shown in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3 id="e185">Silk and Tea - Raw Silk Exports Pale in Comparison <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Exports of 5,156 Bales in the Second Half of November</p>
<p>The statistics for Shanghai's raw silk exports in the first half of November have already been reported in the previous newspaper. The statistics for the second half of the month are recorded below. Raw silk exports in the second half of the month totaled 3,760 bales, and Qingsi silk totaled 1,396 bales, totaling 5,156 bales, an increase of 419 bales compared to the first half of the month. However, when comparing the total for this year to date with last year, there is a huge decrease of 14,954 bales. Considering this figure, there are still many hidden worries for the future of the silk industry.</p>

<p>Yesterday's overseas silk market was very soft. New York's near-term contracts fell by six points, and the distant-term contracts also fell by six points. The other Japanese silk 83 and 75 were sold evenly, falling by two to five points. Shanghai silk 78 and Guangdong silk both fell by one point. Dalian's silk market saw spot prices fall by 13 yuan, and futures prices fall by five yuan. It is expected that the market will be unstable and blunt. B-grade silk was sold at around 730 yuan. Local silk merchants were unwilling to sell. Indian merchants continued to make sporadic silk transactions. Only merchants from Hangzhou slightly increased their appetite for user silk, with prices falling by about five yuan.</p>

<p>According to tea merchants, in the past two days, Ying Shang Jinlong Yangxing had a need to purchase common tea and eyebrow lu tea coming from Tunxi, Shexian and other places, so they invited the tea factories to discuss a purchase. They already have around 1,000 chests, and will soon close the deal in a few days. It is also heard that Yihe Xiehe and other foreign firms are also working towards separately numbering and sending cables to sell the remaining 5,000 chests of precious tea on the market. The situation is fermenting.</p>

<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>In the past year, the changes in the financial industry have been drastic. Tracing the underlying motivations, some are external, and some are internal. Therefore, by following the causes and seeking the results, it becomes significantly complex. If there is no concrete treatise, not only will future generations find it complicated and difficult to understand, but even those in the current society will struggle to grasp the situation. Mr. Wei Youfei has, from November of the 24th year of the Republic to August of this year, collected extensive materials on the lead-up to and aftermath of the Chinese financial panic, as well as the significant developments in fiscal matters. This collection is indeed worthy of the title, "China's Finance at the Present Stage." Mr. Wei is one of the most attentive researchers of modern economics and a dedicated author. I believe that all the text is realistic, and the author himself hopes that it will be of some help to those studying China's economy and the economic changes of this period in the future. I share this sentiment and am happy to introduce it. Please inquire at the Ningbo Road Money Trade Monthly Office for general sales. The price is sixty cents.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Sugar Market: Domestically Produced Green and Red Sugar Continue to Rise Sharply <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to a shortage of domestically produced green and red sugar arrivals, sellers vigorously raised prices. For example, new-batch green sugar opened at $34.80, an increase of $0.60-0.70, with over a hundred bags traded. Qilin (麒麟) and Laohu (老虎) brand fine red sugar opened at $16, with over two hundred bags traded, an increase of $0.50-0.60. Additionally, over a hundred bags of Shantong (善通) bag sugar were sold at $14.20, and over seventy ties of Qingyuan (慶元) slab green sugar at $11.60, an increase of $0.40.</p>
<p>The Public Association's benchmark prices remained relatively stable, with No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar spot goods at $21.55, regular re-export goods at $6.12, high-quality goods at $6.15, and No. 89 Shang (商) brand red sugar at $15.65, a slight increase. The original prices were maintained for cotton white sugar from local factories such as Zhenji (振記), Dahua (大華), and Jinxin (金心). Prices for Dong (東) brand white sugar Nos. 4, 8, and 9 also remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Old stock of Xiamen tangerine peel has long been out of stock. Yesterday, a letter from the production area stated that the new goods already show a bright red color and large size, and will be shipped to Shanghai soon. The cost is expected to be one or two dollars higher than the old stock. Upon arrival in Shanghai, due to empty warehouses, it should sell well.</p>

<p>Price Fixed at $8.40 Gold Yuan; Scattered Transactions Extremely Busy</p>
<p>Since foreign countries in or near Zhenjiang [鎮江] have no [會] iron goods, the price is surprisingly firm, at $8.40 gold yuan per box, an increase of $0.40 from before (equivalent to about $36 in Shanghai market prices, including foreign taxes). Shanghai market counterparts, upon receiving this news, felt greatly encouraged, and dramatically increased their selling prices accordingly, now quoting $37. Although large-volume transactions are not numerous, scattered sales are exceptionally busy. It is estimated that the market released a total of four to five hundred boxes yesterday. Furthermore,囤戶 hoarders have recently been commissioning brokers to buy up supplies everywhere, so the market atmosphere is particularly good, and prices are feared to continue rising.</p>

<p>Overseas prices for new lead wire have been steadily increasing recently. Yesterday, sizes 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 were sold at £9 12s 6d per ton, another increase of 12s 6d from before. Sizes 16 to 20 required £10 5s per ton, also up 7s from before. It is said that the overseas market is surprisingly strong, and there is currently no spot stock. If counterparts place orders, they must wait until March for shipment. Shanghai market prices have also risen sharply in response to the brisk overseas prices, with selling prices increasing by $0.50 to $1.00 across the board.</p>

<p>— Mingxin</p>
<p>Iron Chancellor Bismarck, upon ascending to the premiership, exerted his power to the fullest, promoting his unique ideas until Germany was revitalized. At that time, he once said to the representatives of the people: "The current problems can only be solved with iron and blood." We, the 470 million lonely and helpless people, crushed under the immeasurable national crisis, should also unanimously make the greatest determination and say to our own souls: "The current problems can only be solved with iron and blood."</p>
<p>If this can be genuinely expressed, it is foreseeable that in ten years, our old and great China will also rejuvenate, and like Germany rebuilt by Bismarck, will gradually become stronger and become a truly first-class power in the world. Then the sleeping lion will awaken, and the saying "dead pig" will truly be inaccurate. (Mingxin)</p>
<h3 id="e194">A Woman Who Doesn't Shed Tears <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>Who says women are good at crying? I don't believe it. Please let me present three recent events as proof. The first event concerns Mrs. Li, with whom I live. Mrs. Li has been married for seven years and is the mother of two children. Mr. Li treats her well, and the couple's relationship is quite harmonious. However, recently, Mrs. Li suddenly fell in love with her cousin, who is a section chief in a certain bank and recently widowed, and abruptly filed for divorce from Mr. Li. This was like a bolt from the blue for Mr. Li, who became so angry that he fell ill. In bed, he constantly shed tears, but Mrs. Li forced him to write a divorce letter and constantly threatened him. Unable to resist, Mr. Li gritted his teeth and succumbed with tears. Mrs. Li left that very night with the divorce letter. As she left, her three-year-old child was asleep, and her five-year-old child clung to her clothes, but she finally pushed the child away and left.</p>
<p>The second event is the death of my cousin. Before the coffin was even prepared, my cousin's wife concentrated on pressing her sixty-year-old in-laws for a dowry of ten thousand dollars. She eloquently told the relatives and friends present that her in-laws were unkind and usually cold. Now that her husband has died, the future is unimaginable, so she is making this request while relatives and friends are present to avoid future disputes. Her in-laws, grieving for the loss of their son and upset by her noise, burst into tears. But she showed no tears at all, instead speaking more energetically. Throughout my cousin's funeral, all we heard was her incessant chatter, without seeing her shed a single tear.</p>
<p>Another incident is the so-called "A-Geng's wife" in our neighborhood. A-Geng was a mason who fell from a roof before February. He didn't get hurt at the time, but later he suddenly started coughing up blood. He died less than ten days after coughing up blood. A-Geng's wife didn't cry; instead, she was happy, saying that she could never get ahead with this poor ghost. A week later, her four-year-old daughter suddenly disappeared. Her daughter disappeared, but she didn't cry or look for her; instead, she was even happier, saying that she was relieved. Half a month later, she found a partner and moved away joyfully.</p>
<p>Who says women are good at crying? These three are the women I have personally seen who do not cry. Although they were all faced with events that would make even men want to cry, I swear that none of them moved a stony heart. Humans are not made of wood or stone; how can they be without feelings? Yet there are women in the world who find themselves in pitiable circumstances and do not cry. Hey, truly amazing. But I always feel that it seems a little inhuman.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Fish and Wine <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The other day, it was famous director Dan Junyu's fortieth birthday, and I went to congratulate him. Recently, Mr. Du has grown tired of the silver screen and celluloid life, and keeps several tanks of tropical fish in his home to amuse himself. The bottom of the tanks is lined with Yuhua Terrace patterned stones, and several stems of tropical grass are planted, their green color so clear. The fish swim among them, making one feel as if one is on the Hao River bridge. The most beautiful fish are the angelfish, with their flat bodies and long fins, patterned with stripes and delightful colors. It is said that these fish can eat flies, but I have not witnessed it. Mr. Du is skilled in oil painting, and his still lifes are remarkably lifelike. There are glass fish, their bodies completely transparent, through which their internal organs can be seen; and there are Lili fish, their tails a light purple color, whose call sounds like a frog. They are truly special specimens. Fighting fish are naturally belligerent, but since there is only one, it cannot engage in hostile action. Mr. Du drives it to the edge of the tank and shows it a mirror. The fish sees its reflection in the mirror, flaring its fins and opening its mouth, with the appearance of killing an enemy. Its body color changes, sometimes green, sometimes red, like a rainbow or brocade, like Shu brocade unfurling or a strange flower budding. No wonder the people of Siam consider fighting fish to be their sole entertainment. After watching for a while, Mr. Du treated me to fine wine. Drinking it, the taste was mellow and rich, with no dry throat or mouth. When I asked about it, he said: "This is Moutai wine, the famous brew of Qian (Guizhou)." The wine is produced in Moutai Village, Renhuai County. Due to transportation difficulties and exorbitant taxes, it is not easy to get it out of the province. In the spring of the sixteenth year, my cousin Maoxin brought back several urns from that place. Drinking it, the fragrance lingered on the teeth and cheeks for days. Since then, whenever I have good food, I think of the famous wine. I have not tasted it for ten years. One day, I happened to pass a shop on Sanma Road and saw a sign saying that it was selling Moutai wine on consignment, but I was too poor to buy it and take it home. By coincidence, the owner of a certain bookstore visited me the other day and asked me to paint two cover designs, for which I was paid twenty gold coins. I immediately bought five bottles from the market, each bottle costing four gold coins, which was exactly the right amount. After ten years of longing, my wish was fulfilled in one morning. What joy! I want to share this joy with you all tonight." Those present at the table were Jiang Zimei, Kang Zhuang Ziguo, his great-nephew Dan Erchun, and Madam Yin Mingzhu, all of whom were tipsy.</p>
<h3 id="e196">White Reeds, Red Smartweed, and a Flock of Wild Ducks <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Delin</p>
<p>White reeds and red smartweed adorn the scenery of early winter. By the shores of Taihu Lake and Dongting Lake, there are also flocks of thousands upon thousands of wild ducks. They seem to beat their wings like falling leaves, holding their heads high against the wind. Amidst the lakes and mountains, they weave a magnificent and vast scene. If you were to find yourself in such a setting at Taihu Lake or Dongting Lake and look out over the vast expanse, you would surely be stirred with aspirations of transcending mortality. But will they always be so carefree and leisurely? No, humans need to consider them as delicacies of the season. At this time, Taihu Lake is filled with many small boats, rowing back and forth, chasing after the flocks of wild ducks. Using skilled techniques, hunters aim their shotguns. With a single shot, the wild ducks fall from the sky, landing in clumps of reeds or on the surface of the lake. When you buy this "Taihu delicacy" from a game shop and happily savor it, you may often find bullet fragments in it. The skill of shooting ducks with a shotgun is a secret known only to the fishermen of the Dongting Lake water region. No matter how skilled you are with a gun, no matter how clever your shooting techniques, if you try it on the shores of Taihu Lake, you will be disappointed and unable to shoot a single duck. But the fishermen, as long as they aim, will hit their targets every time without missing a shot. Their methods are extremely skilled and agile.</p>
<p>In addition to guns, wild ducks can also be captured with "heavenly nets." Fishermen row their boats to where there are the most wild ducks and, using all their strength, pull up the large "heavenly net." This net covers the sky and comes crashing down on the lake. The wild ducks, trapped by the net, have no way to escape and are captured alive. If you walk past the front of a game shop, you can see not only bunches of dead wild ducks hanging there, but also live wild ducks crowded together in wire cages, a testament to the overwhelming demand.</p>
<p>At dusk, the neon lights of the game shop, spelling out "wild duck," tempt the vision and appetite of every passerby. In the chilly early winter weather, the rich savor the taste of wild duck and sleep on soft, downy wild duck quilts. The texture is so light and soft, and the price is very high. It's a wonderfully comfortable life, but the wild ducks that were still flying freely in the sky amidst the lakes and mountains today will be plucked of their feathers and eaten tomorrow. A heartbreaking sight for the wild ducks! The wealthy should not follow in their footsteps.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Epitaph for Zheng Gong Yuanru of Yongchun <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zengqi</p>
<p>Gong's given name was Weinian, courtesy name Shide, literary name Yuanru, from the Zheng family. He was a descendant of Mr. Zheng Jie. The first ancestor, Duke Dunhou, moved from Shandong to Yongchun at the end of the Ming Dynasty and named Beixiang after Zheng Jie. From the seventh-generation ancestor upwards, all were diligent farmers. The eighth-generation ancestor, Duke Boliangshi, passed the imperial examination in the early Kangxi period. After that, those who passed the examinations appeared one after another, and the Zheng family became a prominent family in Yongchun. His father, Duke Weiting, had hidden virtues. Gong was thirteen years old and exceptionally intelligent. At that time, the Zheng family had ancestral businesses in Fujian. Gong asked his father if he could go and work together. His father agreed. Within a year, the business improved. His father heard this and was pleased, saying, "This son will surely glorify our family, I have no worries." Gong served his grandparents and parents diligently, and was able to win their hearts. He treated his elder brother, Duke Geru, with great respect. His brother was fond of learning but did not succeed, so he placed great hopes on his son. Gong understood his brother's intentions and ordered his nephew Shulin to study at Waseda University in Japan, loving him as his own son. After the Xinhai Revolution, the region experienced many disturbances. He initiated the organization of local militias to protect the villages, on which the entire township relied. Commander Yan Guangwei greatly valued him, and often came to Gong's home to consult him, calling him the "shield of Yongchun." Later, Gong went to Xiamen to support his son Yushu, who was raising funds. As he was leaving, the villagers blocked the road to keep him, fearing that if Gong left, the entire township would not have a day of peace. In the countryside, he initiated the establishment of a primary school at Jiaxi, which achieved remarkable results. He also founded Yuanru School, spending over ten thousand gold coins, all by Gong's own efforts. Gong was born in the fourth month of the Dingmao year of the Tongzhi reign (1867) and died in the fourth month of the Yichou year (1925) at the age of fifty-nine. He married twice, both from the Hong family of Nan'an. He had four sons: Yushu, Yulin, and Xianglin, born to his first wife; and Zhonglin, born to his second wife. He had two daughters, both born to his second wife, who both married into the Hong family. He had ten grandsons: Kuiyi and Qichao by Yushu; Qishen, Qixi, Qiliang, Qiqian, and Qitai by Yulin; and Qixun, Qiyao, and Qimo by Xianglin. Yushu served as the Xiamen Circuit Intendant, known for his political achievements and loved by the people. They will bury Gong on a certain day of a certain month at Changlunwei in his hometown. Beforehand, they came to request an inscription. According to Gong's life deeds, all should be inscribed. Therefore, this is a summary of his life, which is buried in the underworld, along with an inscription in verse: "In the land of Jiaxi, there was a virtuous man, whose benevolence extended to all things, whose righteousness established his life, who diligently cultivated his conduct and was always near the Way. Although his position was not prominent, his name will not be forgotten. Future generations will tell of him, as they look upon this steadfast stone."</p>

<p>Chapter 9: Bad News Startles as a Beauty Falls into Filth; Her Fragrant Trail Leads Frequently, and a Heart is Like Catkins Stuck in Mud</p>
<p>Youmei, seeing the determined look on his face, deliberately calmed herself first, placed her teacup on the coffee table, sat down leisurely, and smiled slightly: "Has Cousin not known of Menglan's background since corresponding with her?" Guoqi said: "How can I ask about someone's background in a letter?" Youmei nodded and sat silently. Guoqi's face was a little flushed, and he himself did not understand why, his heart already leaping a little. He then said: "Just now, Ms. Li said that she had been chained since childhood. What does that mean?" Youmei said: "In truth, I shouldn't tell you. It's not as if it is some secret of hers that I shouldn't tell you. It's just that after telling you, you will add another layer of worry to your heart." Guoqi, upon hearing this, looked even more dejected. He nodded and said: "That doesn't matter. I knew long ago that she was a heartbroken person." Youmei said: "To tell Cousin the truth, in her eyes, perhaps only I can be considered half a confidante, someone with whom she can chat. In addition, she herself believes that in this life, she will not find a good companion. The reason for this is that her parents put a chain on her when she was young. Does Cousin understand now?" Guoqi said: "So, her parents have already betrothed her to someone in a womb marriage." "This is an extremely bad custom in Chinese society. I didn't expect it to fall on her head, unfortunately." He sighed after speaking. Youmei said: "Although it's not a womb marriage, the engagement day was when she was very young. She comes from a prominent family, and it's not easy to break old habits. She doesn't want to make her whole family unhappy for her own sake, and she also knows how a modern woman should behave. Amidst the conflict between new and old ideas, she is extremely distressed. We, as friends, can't help her make a decision." Saying this, Youmei adjusted her hair and looked towards the door curtain, meaning that she was afraid that Old Madam Zhang would hear. She then continued: "Having no other choice, she has to seek solace in books. Unexpectedly, Cousin's writing is very much to her liking, and she doesn't want to live in this corner of Nanjing City…" To put it superstitiously, perhaps this is the little god of creation deliberately playing tricks on people. I see it from the side and feel very sorry for her. I am willing to help her to a certain extent." She paused here, raised her head and thought for a moment, then smiled slightly at Guoqi: "I'm sorry, I'm very clumsy, and there are many things that I need to say, but I can't say them all. However, Cousin is a learned person, and you don't need me to say anything; you will understand that I am completely well-intentioned." (108)</p>

<h3 id="e200">Inner Mongolia, a Miniature of the National Defense Line <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the bandit rebellion in Suidong, the people of the country have paid extreme attention to national defense. In addition to doing our best to provide practical support to the soldiers defending the country, we should have a deep understanding of the current situation in Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>Inner Mongolia was still in a nomadic state at the end of the Yuan Dynasty. The political organization was not established until the early Qing Dynasty. The Qing court unified the Mongolian princes and clans and changed the system to leagues and banners. The desert was often used as the boundary, with Outer Mongolia to the north of the desert and Inner Mongolia to the south. Inner Mongolia consisted of twenty-four tribes and forty-nine banners, forming six leagues. Among them, three leagues, such as Jerim, Josutu, and Juu Uda, consisting of fourteen tribes and twenty-six banners, were included in the so-called "Wangdao Paradise" after the September 18th Incident. The current rebellion is occurring in parts of the three leagues of Xilingol, Ih Juu, and Ulanqab, consisting of ten tribes and twenty-three banners. The so-called banner is equivalent to a county in other provinces and is the unit of administrative division. Multiple banners form a league. Each banner has a head called a Jasagh, and each league has a league leader and deputy league leader. The administrative power adopts a deliberative system. In recent years, the hereditary Jasaghs have gradually adopted an election system. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China (1928), the area was formally reorganized into the provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The localities were also the same as the interior, with county magistrates and police soldiers, etc., thus transforming their nomadic state.</p>
<p>The climate in Inner Mongolia is relatively cold, with winter temperatures below minus 40 degrees Celsius. Spring and autumn each last one month, and summer lasts two months, with the rest of the year being winter. Except for the south, the land is not suitable for cultivation, but animal husbandry is extremely prosperous, with pastures everywhere, not as desolate as we imagine. The population of Inner and Outer Mongolia is roughly five million, with Outer Mongolia having only one million, and the three provinces of Inner Mongolia having four million. Areas such as Guihua and Baotou are already as bustling as the interior. The Han and Mongol peoples are loving and indistinguishable from each other. The lower classes there practice monogamy, while the middle and upper classes practice polygamy. The first wife has great power, handling household affairs, and her hairstyle and clothing are special, which concubines and maids cannot imitate. Women are more diligent and thrifty than men, and their physical strength is comparable to that of men.</p>
<p>Mongols have been good warriors since ancient times, known for their archery and horsemanship. Children of seven or eight years old can ride bareback horses and gallop across the sand. Horse racing and wrestling at lama temple fairs are famous Mongolian competitions. The Mongols are extremely devout to Lamaism. Medicine, prayers, and mediation of affairs are all handled by lamas. If a family has two or three men, one must become a lama, so they account for more than one-third of the total population. The Japanese have been paying attention to Inner Mongolia since long ago. Manchuria and Mongolia have always been closely linked. There is a Manchu-Mongolian school in Tokyo that teaches Manchu and Mongolian to Japanese people for the purpose of deeply infiltrating Inner Mongolia. The instructions for Ren Dan (仁丹) medicine include translations in Manchu and Mongolian, which proves the Japanese research on Mongolian, which is truly astonishing. In our interior, there are many who study Western and Eastern languages, but those who know Manchu and Mongolian are truly rare.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese also opened the Hinggan Military Academy at Wangyemiao at the foot of the Hinggan Mountains. It specializes in recruiting young people from Inner Mongolia and providing them with purely Japanese military education, with the slogan of restoring the heroic achievements of Genghis Khan. After training, they are sent to the native troops of Inner Mongolia to engage in special agent work. This kind of inducement for people to kill each other in order to profit from it is their consistent policy. We, who usually shout to protect the integrity of our national territory, should now unite to support the Inner Mongolian defense line to drive out the despicable elements who are being exploited.</p>

<h3 id="e201">A Woven Fabric of Hard Threats and Soft Comforts: A Superb and Unmatched Treatment for Gonorrhea <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— By Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>…In European and American countries, a domineering, perimembrane bactericidal method has been adopted for the treatment of gonorrhea… The latest and most reliable treatment is to eradicate gonococci with a gentle and effective policy of both suppression and comfort.</p>
<p>Due to China's scientific backwardness, medicine is always stagnant halfway and cannot move forward. Many novel medical inventions in Europe are sometimes completely unknown in China. Although this is due to the underdevelopment of medicine, the low general cultural level of the population is also a major cause.</p>
<p>A disease like gonorrhea is still an intractable problem in Chinese medicine, but European and American countries have long regarded it as a disease like a common cold. The saying that gonorrhea is difficult to treat is a term from the past. The difficulty of gonorrhea has long been broken!</p>
<p>It turns out that since gonococcal scholar Dr. Rudolr M.D. used proteome to treat gonorrhea, the proportion of men and women suffering from gonorrhea has been decreasing day by day. The traces of gonococci have gradually decreased, and it is firmly believed that in the near future, it can be said that there will be no more transmission of gonorrhea in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Dr. [Rudolr] has proved through many studies that if proteome is mixed into that yellow pigment with side effects, the yellow pigment will undergo chemical action and lose its toxicity due to the mixing of the proteome. It becomes a peaceful substance. Because the material of yellow pigment is rough, taking yellow pigment as an oral medicine in the past to kill gonococci (that is, perimembrane sterilization therapy of the urethra) often had great drawbacks and often caused patients to damage their stomach and intestines or kidneys after taking it. Therefore, Europe has long abandoned this treatment. However, the actual efficacy of yellow pigment does have the ability to relieve inflammation of the urethra. So, is it better to use yellow pigment or not to use it? This question has been debated for a long time, until Dr. Rudolr solved it, that is, he proved that if yellow pigment is combined with proteome, there will be no side effects. And the special effect of proteome can cause patients' blood to produce a large amount of blood cells and anti-gonococcal substances to kill gonococci. This method was further developed by Dr. Bi to combine the two into the oral panacea "Kelinnong" [克淋儂]. Although it failed many times at the beginning, it finally succeeded today. The therapeutic effect of "Kelinnong" in treating gonorrhea is ironclad and powerful. But it has no side effects, so it is also a benevolent, gentle method. This medicine can quickly eradicate acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, prostatitis, orchitis, bladder inflammation, and leucorrhea in women after taking it. If it is also used with "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" to wash the urethra at home according to the instructions and illustrations, it will have a special effect! "Kelinnong" contains proteome. All compound gonorrhea remedies that do not contain proteome are counterfeit drugs mixed in. Please identify the three words "Kelinnong" when purchasing.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Health Methods for Those Suffering from Neurasthenia <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>...If active treatment with the youth gland endocrine is applied... then all deteriorating symptoms are guaranteed to be swept away.</p>
<p>The great writer, Bernard Shaw, once said: "The 20th century is the era when neurasthenia is most rampant among humans." Indeed, this is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>With the progress of modern civilization, the use of mental strength and brainpower has become increasingly complex. Under such circumstances, the rampant nature of this condition is inevitable. At the same time, the medical community's contributions to the treatment of this condition also progress with the times. Therefore, no matter how severe or widespread neurasthenia may be, engineers can always guarantee that patients will not despair and can quickly eradicate it based on principles of proven effectiveness!</p>
<p>Tinnitus, headaches, insomnia, forgetfulness, and weakness in the limbs, along with mental exhaustion. These types of neurasthenia affect a relatively large number of patients, and their harm to our health is also relatively severe. Generally, those who are congenitally weak or who experience intense stimulation are very prone to excitement of the peripheral nerves, often leading to neurasthenia. In addition, young people who are excessively dissolute and those who indulge in excessive masturbation during development are more likely to promote this condition. Regarding the eradication of this condition, taking the youth gland endocrine preparation "Bu Ti Kang" is the best option, as it certainly has outstanding effects. If we unfortunately develop this condition, we should use "Bu Ti Kang" early to save ourselves. We must have a firm belief in order to replenish our endocrine system and promote the metabolism of various cells in the body! Patients need not be anxious! The ingredients contained in "Bu Ti Kang" are very comprehensive, and thousands of users almost all have an excellent impression.</p>
<h3 id="e203">A Fundamental Approach Dedicated to Tuberculosis Patients <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>...Treating the lungs cannot be separated from the lungs!... How can we abandon the fundamentals and pursue the trivial?</p>
<p>The treatment of lung disease has undergone countless evolutions throughout history, consuming the efforts of many scholars, but the results have almost all been failures. For example, increasing the connective tissue cells of the lesions; although the theory is correct, people generally try to produce lime from the internal administration of calcium agents, in order to achieve the purpose of connective tissue generation. This is an extremely foolish method. In fact, it is also not easy to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>In addition, some people want to enhance the patient's physical strength, so that the body's resistance is strengthened, in order to achieve the curative effect of eradicating tuberculosis. This statement is even more shallow and laughable! If it were really like that, all diseases in the world would only need to take a few doses of tonic medicine, and the words "medicine" and "treatment" would not be necessary at all.</p>
<p>The latest, such as organ therapy, is actually just trying to reach for the moon with a cloud ladder, because the root of the disease is in the lungs. Of course, treating the lungs cannot be separated from the lungs. How can we write articles off-topic? Therefore, although organ therapy was once popular in Europe, it soon disappeared without a trace!</p>
<p>Today's latest treatment for lung disease focuses on pulmonary relaxation therapy. This is the pulmonary surgery that is currently prevalent in hospitals in various countries, such as pneumothorax, thoracoplasty, etc., but these methods are limited to surgery and are still not universally applicable. Relying on the omnipotence of science, this technique was applied to the treatment of internal medicine, and the latest medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" was invented. This medicine completely acts on the lungs, making the affected lung relax, so that the lesions and cavities contract, thus hemoptysis, sputum coughing, and chest pain can gradually disappear after taking it, and hot flashes subside, night sweats stop, and lung tuberculosis can be completely cured and never recur. However, TB patients who also suffer from neurasthenia, insomnia, seminal emission, and women with irregular menstruation can also take "Bu Ti Kang" for men to treat seminal emission or "Bu Nv Rong" for women to regulate menstruation at the same time, which will have good results!</p>
<h3 id="e204">Prevention Methods for Menstrual Problems <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo, Graduate of the Imperial University of Japan Medical School</p>
<p>Menstruation is something that generally occurs in women, but menstruation accompanied by pain indicates that the woman is not healthy. Various symptoms appear on her body, and she feels unparalleled pain in her spirit, often leading to hysteria. There are many examples in clinical experiments.</p>
<p>The causes of menstrual diseases in women are nothing more than abnormal ovarian function and disorders of other endocrine glands. Therefore, in order to prevent the recurrence of menstrual diseases, we must first find ways to correct these conditions. Dysfunction of the ovaries and endocrine functions not only causes menstrual diseases, but also often causes diseases other than menstrual diseases. Such as infertility, and other symptoms. According to the menstrual regulating medicine I have used in the past, "Bu Nv Rong" is the authentic menstrual regulating medicine. Because "Bu Nv Rong" is a preparation containing female endocrine, etc. It can fundamentally correct ovarian dysfunction and other endocrine disorders. Therefore, the effect is rapid and accurate. For example, the wife of Mr. Ding Taiping, who lives on Dalin Road, has been married for five or six years, but has always suffered from irregular menstruation and has never conceived. She has tried almost all Chinese and Western medicines for regulating menstruation and promoting pregnancy. Later, she came to me for treatment. After examination using scientific methods, it was found that her ovarian function was weakened and had a tendency to stop. Therefore, I gave her "Bu Fu Rong" for less than two months, and her menstruation gradually became regular. A year later, her menstruation suddenly stopped again, and I knew she was pregnant. However, Mrs. Ding also had leucorrhea on weekdays, so I also used "Ka Er Xue Di Shi vaginal tablets" as a suppository to remove the leucorrhea, and it was completely cured in three weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Confession of a Person Suffering from Neurasthenia Due to Masturbation <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Submission from Mr. Li Zhefu</p>
<p>Because I was precocious and early-maturing, when I was thirteen or fourteen years old, a friend who was a few years older than me showed me a pornographic book similar to a sexual history, which made me fascinated; so I tried my best to search for books of this kind.</p>
<p>From then on, I found textbooks very boring and tasteless. After reading a few lines, my head would feel heavy and my eyes would be blurred. What is the reason for this? The fact is this: because I was influenced by evil books, I inadvertently aroused masturbation, and since then there was no empty evening. As a result, symptoms such as seminal emission, premature ejaculation, and incomplete development of sexual organs occurred together, gathering in one body.</p>
<p>In addition, headaches, blurred vision, memory loss, and palpitations also followed. As a result, my face was thin and I looked like a consumptive ghost. At that time, I took a photo, which is still there (enclosed with the letter). Look how thin and ugly I am! At that time, I would also have nocturnal emission after exercising for a long time, and my body would feel tired. Sometimes my body would feel hot. If I sat on a stool, semen would gradually slip out, and I would have no strength to walk, visual impairment (eye distension), dry mouth, constipation, and thin muscles without blood. If I used my brain a little at night, I couldn't sleep.</p>
<p>But in June of this year, thanks to the instructions of Dr. Chen, I took nine to twelve pills of "Bu Ti Kang" every day. After taking it like this for more than two months, I have completely cured the above symptoms. My memory has increased, my thinking is agile, my face is also plump, and my skin is fair and tender. I am much younger than I was a few years ago. Therefore, I took another photo today to keep as a souvenir (also enclosed with the letter).</p>
<p>I am very grateful to Dr. Chen, and especially grateful to "Bu Ti Kang" for saving my life. Alas! "Bu Ti Kang" is really the savior of neurasthenia patients!</p>

<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Leucorrhea is the most popular hidden disease among our female compatriots. Because it is very common and regarded as a hidden disease, we do not pay much attention to treatment. It is allowed to spread. But to overcome leucorrhea is not an easy task, and it must be treated separately. And the main suppository is only "Ka Er Xue Di Shi vaginal tablets". Because this kind of external medicine can be secretly treated at home without the need for a doctor's instructions, and it can be cured in a short three or four weeks. However, we must pay attention to its cause. If it is caused by gonorrhea, then in addition to using this tablet as a suppository, we must also use "Ke Lin Nong" as an internal medicine to eliminate internal gonococcal toxins. If it is caused by underdevelopment or menstrual difficulties, we can also take "Bu Nv Rong". Those who are underdeveloped can promote development, and those who have menstrual difficulties can adjust menstruation.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea Mistaken for Hemorrhoids</p>
<p>Diagnosis is not an easy task, and it is often confused with other diseases. Especially gonorrhea. If a detailed and accurate diagnosis is not carried out, it is difficult to distinguish. For example, hemorrhoids are a disease of the anal area, which is originally unrelated to gonorrhea, but many gonorrhea patients do not know the changes in their disease. It is a complication of gonorrhea, but they mistakenly think it is hemorrhoids. In fact, it is rectal gonorrhea. This disease often occurs when gonorrhea secretions contaminate the mucous membrane of the anus, or from prostatitis, seminal vesicle abscess, and even from transmission in the toilet during bowel movements. The symptoms are redness around the anus and a yellow pus discharge, which later often leads to bleeding and erosion. Therefore, it is easiest to infect the wife. The anus becomes narrower due to ulceration, eventually making it impossible to defecate. The more accumulation, the more gonococci, and the greater the danger. If the treatment is not correct, the anus will often leave hard knots, causing the anus to lose its elasticity and become anal stricture.</p>
<p>Patients often do not pay attention to these symptoms, so they are often introduced to me by hemorrhoid specialists for treatment, such as Mr. Lu Shuyun, who lives on Haining Road. According to him, although he had contracted gonorrhea before, it had been cured. Not long after, hemorrhoids suddenly occurred, and after several treatments, it did not work. Later, Dr. Zhu, a hemorrhoid specialist, diagnosed it as gonorrhea, so he introduced him to me for treatment. I used "Kang Lin Shui" to wash and electrotherapy, and at the same time, he took German "Ke Lin Nong" to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and prevent decay. After five weeks. It was completely cured. Bowel movements are as smooth as ever. His wife also contracted gonorrheal leucorrhea and cavity erosion. I also instructed her to use "Ka Er Xue Di Shi vaginal tablets" as a suppository, and she still took "Ke Lin Nong" internally. In less than five weeks, all her diseases were cured. Later, the couple used serum to repeatedly test more than ten times, and there was not a single gonococcal reaction. This is proof of a definite cure, so they have lived together ever since and have never had any changes in their illness.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Causes and Treatment of Sexual Dysfunction <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>The number of people who feel troubled due to loss of sexual function is actually beyond what people generally expect. The most tragic thing is seminal emission caused by masturbation. The reason is that after seminal emission, the body produces more semen than it needs, which not only hinders the development of the reproductive organs, but also often leads to premature ejaculation and impotence, causing extremely tragic sexual dysfunction, making you never enjoy healthy happiness. Furthermore, you cannot experience the sweetest part of married life, which is like living a widowed life. Isn't this a great misfortune in life?</p>
<p>The most famous sexologists abroad all say: Seminal emission is the ladder to all venereal diseases. Therefore, generally sensual young people must never get caught up in the whirlpool of masturbation. This is the golden rule for young people. Especially young people who are crossing the line should receive effective treatment early and must not wander off course!</p>
<p>To treat this disease, we must adapt to the physique and the degree of its symptoms. If we actively treat it with "Nai Er Si Seminal Emission Tablets", it will show a significantly better effect. Now let's look at a random example to understand everything. - Patient Tao Wen, 23 years old, suffered from seminal emission due to excessive masturbation, which resulted in sexual dysfunction such as premature ejaculation and impotence. He took various medicines, but it was difficult to cure. Then, he was treated with "Nai Er Si Seminal Emission Tablets". After five weeks, seminal emission stopped, and the soundness of his sexual function was unparalleled.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Is the Future of Sino-Japanese Relations Really Not Pessimistic? <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>The other day, Mr. Kawagoe Daizen from Japan came to Shanghai and gave a speech at the Japanese Shenjiang Club, saying (1) the Suiyuan incident has been declared by the Japanese authorities to be unrelated to Japan, (2) the future of Sino-Japanese relations is not pessimistic, and so on. However, although the Suiyuan incident has been declared by the Japanese authorities to be unrelated, a certain Japanese military strategist once had the tone of admitting it frankly. The so-called facts speak louder than words, we will not discuss this for the time being. As for saying that the future of Sino-Japanese relations is not pessimistic, we really cannot understand it even if we think about it a hundred times.</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe went to Beijing to negotiate with our country's diplomatic authorities to adjust national relations. The period has exceeded two months, and there have been as many as eight formal negotiations between the two sides. The number of informal contacts between diplomatic personnel of the two countries is even innumerable. However, the result is nothing. The opportunity for negotiations between the two sides is largely at a standstill, so whether the subsequent negotiations between the two sides can continue to resume is still a question that is suspected and cannot be determined.</p>
<p>Judging from this situation, there are more pessimistic situations between the two countries, and few optimistic situations. I don't know from what point of view Ambassador Kawagoe sees the possibility of not being pessimistic? The right to be pessimistic or not pessimistic originally rests with the Japanese side, not with our country, because if the Japanese side abandons its mainland advancement policy, it can be optimistic. Assuming that the Japanese side is unwilling to abandon this policy, then it cannot be pessimistic even if it wants to. This time, the negotiations between the two sides have exceeded two months, and the reason why they have not achieved satisfactory results is (1) mostly because the Japanese side's desires are too extravagant, its arrogance is too great, it only thinks of itself, and does not think of others at all, (2) one side conducts formal diplomatic negotiations, and the other side uses military threats. This attitude is completely wrong. This kind of method cannot be applied now, and it has a bad impression on the national relations negotiations. Therefore, the reason for the suspension of this negotiation, the Suiyuan incident, is also one of them.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are two reasons for the Japanese side's misconception of clinging to this policy and refusing to change it: (1) The Japanese side is too superstitious that force is a panacea, thinking that with a huge army and navy, it can get whatever it wants and do whatever it wants, (1) Due to the wrong observation of our country, thinking that it is the China of the late Qing Dynasty and the warlord separatist era, it can be intimidated and lured to do whatever it wants. This kind of observation is actually insufficient understanding. For example, in the Suiyuan incident that occurred recently, the bandits and puppets were allowed to ravage the border city, and in Qingdao, the landing of the marines was made in the name of labor unrest. The Sino-Japanese negotiations have been affected by the Suiyuan incident, and the Qingdao incident has continued to occur. It can be seen that the Japanese side has not shown any signs of awakening from beginning to end. Can the future of Sino-Japanese relations really not be pessimistic?</p>
<h3 id="e212">"Literature is Useless" and "Literature Ruins the Country" <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— A Dun</p>
<p>All literati like to emphasize the function of literature. Like Turgenev's Hunter's Notes, which promoted the emancipation of serfs in Russia, and Goethe's romantic works, which pioneered the Sturm und Drang movement. As for Rousseau's Social Contract Theory, it is the basis of democracy. As for China, it is even more extraordinary. "Literature is the warp and weft of the world" elevates the word "literature" to the ninth heaven.</p>
<p>In fact, this kind of statement is fine for literati to whisper to each other in peaceful times, but it is not good when the world is in trouble. Because at that time, the so-called usefulness of literature is just "ruining the country and disrupting the clan." Let's take an old example first.</p>
<p>"Jin Lord Liang was quite knowledgeable and admired the West Lake paintings of Liu Qiqing, and was pleasantly inspired by the osmanthus in the autumn and the lotus flowers ten miles away, so he changed his mind to throw his whip across the river. He secretly ordered craftsmen to write images of the mountains and rivers of Lin'an in the envoy, and the sentence 'Ma Wu Mountain is the first peak' (Xu Lei Yuan Tan)</p>
<p>According to this, the reason why the Jin Dynasty repeatedly invaded the Central Plains was all due to Liu Laoqing's "West Lake Paintings". Liu Lao became famous in Beining with his lyrics, "Where will I wake up tonight? Willow bank, dawn wind, and waning moon." It was recited for a time, and it was even called "Dawn Wind, Waning Moon, Liu Tuntian".</p>
<p>Liu was also known as Liu Sanbian, and his lyrics were all written for prostitutes and geishas, so they were extremely beautiful. Yuan Qi said, "Liu Qi, dawn wind, waning moon, can make seventeen young girls and eight women sing it with red ivory clappers." For such a person, with such works, he actually made the hero of the enemy country "happily think of throwing his whip across the river," which is really unbelievable. The Jin Dynasty was always a great trouble for the Zhao Song Dynasty. Yue Shaobao fought to the death, but still could not "return my rivers and mountains," and the reason for inviting the enemy was Liu Qiqing's few lyrics. Some people naturally think that the ministers at that time blamed a poor literati for the responsibility of "ruining the country." However, we just know that the ministers insist on saying this, what can we do?</p>
<p>As for modern examples, there are even more. A certain general said that the literature of brothers and sisters can ruin the country, so he ordered the prohibition of falling leaves; a certain writer even said that punctuation marks are also the cause of ruining the country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although there are examples of literature ruining the country, there are not enough examples of literature saving the country. Mr. Lu Xun said in an essay "At the Crossroads of Literature and Politics," "The reason why Sun Chuanfang was driven away was because the revolutionaries bombarded him with cannons, and it was definitely not because the revolutionary literati wrote a few sentences of 'Sun Chuanfang, we want to drive you away!' This is all there is to say.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren is the most famous advocate of the theory that literature is useless. He said in The Origin of Chinese New Literature, "From the many words I have said above, everyone should be able to see that literature is a useless thing, because what we call literature is only to satisfy the expression of the author's thoughts and feelings, and there is no other purpose to speak of. There is no great motivating power in it, nor is there any teaching, it can only make people feel happy." In fact, I think it is better to say that all literature is useless. Because only by first explaining that literature is useless can it not bear the guilt of ruining the country. Otherwise, even the works that Mr. Zhou Zuoren said "are only to satisfy the expression of the author's thoughts and feelings, and there is no other purpose to speak of," like Liu Qi's "West Lake Paintings," will also arouse Jin Lord Liang's "will to throw his whip across the river." What else is there to say!</p>
<p>Therefore, I am shouting here, "Literature is useless!"</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Blind Man <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ting</p>
<p>After several days of rain, the weather suddenly turned cold.</p>
<p>I didn't go out. My wife came in from outside and said that the blind man living in the attic room was making a fuss again, groping around for Little Tiger. Hearing this, I opened the door and went out.</p>
<p>The attic room door was slightly open. From the top of the stairs, I could clearly see the messy pile inside: a broken bed, benches, a wooden table, a rice pot, a kerosene lamp, and a chamber pot. As I pushed the door open, the blind man had already climbed out of bed, hoarsely calling out, "Little Tiger, Little Tiger!" while stretching out his hands to grope around the room as if playing hide-and-seek.</p>
<p>He must have been thirty-two or three years old. He was unusually tall and spoke with a thick Shandong accent. He used to perform in traveling shows, but later, due to illness, he went blind in both eyes. He moved in here two months ago with his family of three. The woman was a young woman of twenty-six or seven. It was said that five years ago, she was skilled with a gun. After the tall man went blind, she went to work in a factory. She had gold teeth and liked to look at people from the corner of her eye. The other one was Little Tiger, around seven years old, covered in greasy clothes and black soot. For a cigarette butt or half a sesame cake, he would often throw punches in the alley to entertain people.</p>
<p>Every day, the blind man carried a foot-long rectangular wooden box, and Little Tiger carried a small stool in front, guiding him to the streets to sell Wenwang divination. The young woman, however, was not always home. Sometimes she wasn't home all day and didn't return until one or two in the morning, and sometimes she didn't come home at all. Although the blind man was concerned about her, he dared not disbelieve what she said.</p>
<p>Sometimes, around nine in the evening, when I returned from outside, I would see him still sitting on the stool, his feet neatly aligned as if selling divination, his back ramrod straight, tapping the ground with a bamboo stick to urge Little Tiger to cook. I couldn't help but stop in front of him and ask in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Your wife hasn't returned yet!"</p>
<p>"She's probably working the night shift again. I heard the yarn prices are rising, and the factory is busy..." he said, hurriedly reaching for his tobacco box and offering me the six-inch-long pipe: "Have a smoke, Mr. Hong..."</p>
<p>I politely declined and exchanged a few words before walking away.</p>
<p>Many people in the house had things to say about the young woman working a night shift on top of her twelve-hour day job. When the blind man wasn't home, some awkward women would come and go, and often men would be waiting in the alley. This was a fact that almost everyone in the alley knew, but the blind man was kept in the dark. He lived his life between his Wenwang divination, the stool, and the wooden clapper.</p>
<p>I stood silently by the door. The blind man blinked his blind eyes and then angrily gritted his teeth, muttering, "Little Tiger, I'm going to beat your mother!" He raised his fists and groped over, as if to land a punch on me. I knew he had made a mistake and quickly said:</p>
<p>"It's me, Mr. Chen..."</p>
<p>He seemed startled and quickly stopped, lowering his fists and apologetically saying:</p>
<p>"I thought it was Little Tiger, I'm sorry! It's you, Mr. Hong... Please, sit down. Little Tiger's mother worked the night shift last night and hasn't come back. The house is a mess, I hope you don't mind!..." He then slapped the bed loudly, indicating for me to sit down.</p>
<p>I sat down, and he sat down too. We were both silent for a while.</p>
<p>The stairs creaked, and Little Tiger pushed the door open and came in. His hands and face were red from the wind outside.</p>
<p>"Little Tiger, where did you go? Your father was looking for you..." I asked.</p>
<p>Little Tiger ignored me. He gasped for breath as he went towards his father.</p>
<p>"Dad, I saw Mom. She was in a hotel with a man. I wanted to go in, but the man chased me out. Mom didn't even look at me..."</p>
<p>The blind man widened his blind eyes in shock. After a moment, he sternly scolded:</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Your mother went to work the night shift..." Then, he remembered that it was already around nine in the morning, and even if she was working the night shift, she should have returned by now. He was silent, shook his head, and sighed softly.</p>
<p>Little Tiger felt wronged and wanted to argue, but he knew his father was angry, so he shut his mouth and looked at the cement floor.</p>
<p>Around midnight, we were awakened by the blind man's hoarse voice and the woman's sharp cries. However, no one got up, and no one wanted to pay attention to him.</p>
<p>The next day, in the open space on Huade Road, I ran into him again. He was sitting there with his back straight, silently holding the wooden box and shaking it; but I could no longer see his former excitement and triumphant air. Little Tiger was still in another corner, performing boxing for a dozen passersby for half a sesame cake.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Little Sea Ballad <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ji</p>
<p>The night at sea...</p>
<p>At first, the ship, as if drunk from the salty water, swayed as it moved. In the bumpy cabin, the stench of human bodies mixed with the smell of white paint. The Javanese woman sleeping in the corner emitted a piercing snore, truly a sound that disturbed my sorrow of parting.</p>
<p>This was my first time, embarking on this distant journey with the dreams of youth. I possessed a vibrant heart.</p>
<p>I loved the sea: "Go to see the sea when the waves are small!" I murmured as I lay down, feeling my whole body suspended in mid-air, swaying so violently! The fellow traveler next to me was also a young man, covering his slender body with a brown felt blanket, his tiny eyes half-open, as if dreaming.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about right now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, I'm a little homesick!"</p>
<p>"How childish!"</p>
<p>"So are you," he propped himself up halfway with his hands, "I can see the tears in your eyes..."</p>
<p>People who lack travel experience have too much travel sorrow, especially since we were leaving home, going to a distant, unfamiliar place.</p>
<p>After everyone fell asleep late at night, I was still awake. I drifted through jumbled thoughts, tossing and turning until dawn...</p>
<p>The sea was most beautiful at dusk. It was the second day of the ship's voyage. I felt that home was so far away that I could only grasp it in my dreams, so I dragged my heavy feet to the deck alone.</p>
<p>The ship was now sailing smoothly, as if it had woken up from its drunken stupor. The waves were white, splashing more than a foot high at the bow, truly rolling towards the back. The wind blew, and I seemed to smell the scent of coconut groves: but surrounding me was only the sea!</p>
<p>The sun hung on the horizon, weakly sprinkling on the sea, reflecting golden light. There was a bright red glow on the horizon; facing it, I was reminded of the mixed-race girl who always walked slowly on Mango Road, always wearing red clothes, and in front of my door, she always liked to slow down her steps and sing—</p>
<p>"Mangoes are sour, love is sweet,</p>
<p>Yellow boy, what is your taste?"</p>
<p>But now that enchanting song was far away. I was drifting on the sea. When I searched for her in my memory, oh, I could only lean on the railing and gaze at the yellow, blurred sea...</p>
<p>The ship was not far from Singapore. I was eager to see that novel metropolis and rejoiced; but my slender travel companion, who was homesick, wrung out his wet towel on his head: he was sick.</p>
<p>I carefully looked after this young traveler and told him that a new world and new days were ahead of us. He listened quietly, there, to my low words—I had actually become a talkative person!</p>
<p>But, when my words stopped, he turned over and sighed:</p>
<p>"Home!"</p>
<p>"Why do you always sigh?"</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>Seasickness for a single young man was too bitter; his face appeared pale, and he looked haggard. In just two days, we had not even completed one-third of our journey, and we had already tasted the hardships of travelers.</p>
<p>I secretly prayed from the bottom of my heart: "May he recover..." and then lay down on the cabin plank, wanting to sleep quietly for a while.</p>
<p>When the sea is as calm as a large mirror, facing it, people will dream for no reason. First, I took a harmonica and played "Blue Heaven" on the deck, my heart seemed to be immersed in the sea, with the taste of salt.</p>
<p>The distant journey of a young man's sorrow!</p>
<p>The ship finally reached its destination. My travel companion had also recovered. We stepped ashore together, rushing towards our future...</p>

Pick tea until the fifth watch of the night. Choose carefully. Twist slowly. A bag of tea is then made. Red as blood. Green as moss. Everyone says the tea tastes good. The tea drinkers smile happily.</p>

<p>A song and a game of chess. Beautiful concubine on the left, charming wife on the right. Acting with benevolence and righteousness, who can insult? Without flattery or pride, who dares to deceive? Be upright, avoid disputes, enjoy the company of drinking buddies and poetic friends. Plant fields of blessings and do good deeds. Preserve uprightness for descendants. In spring, enjoy the fragrant grass, a hundred reds and ten thousand purples compete in beauty. Never tire of buying wine for a few cups. Laughing at the white cranes flying in the courtyard. In summer, the sun is as hot as a fiery parasol. Invite friends to enjoy the green lotus pond. Clear sounds and beautiful melodies please the heart. Sinking into the east wind, drunk as mud. In autumn, cool breezes blow jade dew. Golden chrysanthemums bloom by the eastern fence. Drink heartily of longevity wine. Endless joy, drunk and unaware. In midwinter, the weather is cold. Old trees shake red leaves. The north wind rolls, clouds rise. Want to write a new poem with snow as the theme. Warm stove, facing a beautiful woman. Embroidered pillows and curtains, sleeping peacefully. The fifth watch is over, still unaware. Snow is three feet high, still complaining it's too low. Life is wonderful enough. Greed for gain and fame is all vanity. No need to climb the ladder to success again.</p>

<p>Opening "Busy with Socializing" (Mimi Collection Inaugural Issue)</p>
<p>Wind, flowers, snow, and moon are lively and joyful. Celebrations, weddings, and funerals require arrangements. Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, Zhou, Wu, Zheng... can't distinguish clearly, the three strokes of Wang and the grass-headed Huang. Funeral notices and invitations are unnecessary. Six or seven decades are definitely worthy of a celebratory toast. A penny stamp travels all over the world. Unobstructed access to all places. Friendship is everywhere. Spring breeze and summer rain naturally correspond. However, people in the mainland already fear the bitterness of socializing. The taste of Shanghai is even harder to bear. When a child is one month old or one year old, sending out invitations is no harm. The mistress of the house, twenty or thirty years old, a big banquet celebrates the birthday. The person becomes even more lively. Small banquets for ordinary days. And also, every family's ancestors and grandfathers. Morning and evening prayers, they do not forget. Filial sons and virtuous grandsons, everyone praises. Red envelopes, everyone writes a proxy incense. If, in their darkness, they can know. The Yellow Springs will be full of joy. The anniversary of the burial is calculated separately. Plus the ancestral hall. Turning around all year round. Red and white posts are really like urging food. Or, the Zhang family lets loose, the Li family sends. Tomorrow, there is no discussion. Social circles can all see. The world's ways are inherently fickle. Wealthy merchants and rich people are not discussed. Brokers secretly hurt. Especially, poor guys who have a hard life. Forced to pretend and climb onto the stage. People do not measure their strength, the gift-givers, in the darkness, cry out their injustice. Issuing invitations, inviting guests as proxies. I am afraid that, in the future, the lawsuit will be filed. I say that, reforming customs and advocating practicality. Socializing must not be extravagant. Weddings and funerals are common to every family. Unnecessary socializing should be improved? Do not learn the superficial customs and scenery.</p>

Two years of husband and wife become a painted cake. It is better to go to the fountain early. Miss Bao is feeling bored. To see the maid bring tea. Said that the girl should protect her jade body as the first thing. Cold fragrance pills, always take, don't be sad. Bao Erye will return to his hometown soon. The filial officials made a lost little baby. Good husband and wife guarantee harmony.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Hu Die's Recent Works <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>"Eternal Smile" Changes Style, Minhang Residence Under Construction</p>
<p>Hu Die's new work, "Eternal Smile," is nearing completion under strenuous work and will be released to the audience this month.</p>
<p>Regarding the content and achievements of "Eternal Smile," we naturally cannot make estimations before the play is released, but some of the actual working conditions are worth reporting. The first is the effort and meticulousness of the film's director, Mr. Wu Cun. He has changed Hu Die's previous style in this play, often using the most psychological or clearest method and explanation to make Hu Die naturally perform his expected acting skills. Therefore, after each shot is completed, the staff is extremely pleased, and everyone is sure that "Eternal Smile" is an extraordinary work, especially Hu Die's brand-new style in this film, which is expected to arouse the audience's surprise.</p>
<p>In addition, Hu Die's self-built residence in Minhang has recently begun construction. The drawings were designed for her by the scenery department of the Star Film Company. It is entirely in the form of a classical Chinese palace, very beautiful and spectacular. It is expected to be completed in the spring of next year. She said: This is built with a little accumulation of her hard work under the mercury lamp for more than ten years. It certainly cannot be compared with the star billionaires of Hollywood, but she already feels very satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Nan Jingying's "Luo Chou Qi Hen" <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Sinclair Lewis's masterpiece Dodsworth has readers all over the world. No one who has read the book is not moved. Now Hollywood producer Goldwyn has put this masterpiece on the screen. The expressive Walter Huston, the protagonist in the film "Lincoln," plays the main role in the film. Ruth Chatterton, who was very popular a few years ago, has not been seen on the screen for a long time, and she plays Huston's wife in "Luo Chou Qi Hen." The plot is very profound, telling a story between the couple of a large entrepreneur. It is very thorough in its description of the demands of both sexes and the unspoken pain of love between husband and wife. The film will be released this Thursday after "Casting Love" is finished at the Nanjing Grand Theatre.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Hua'an Broadcasting <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>In Sun Yu's new all-dialogue sound film "Spring Comes to the World," there is a unique subtitle, "But, how many people in the world can smile? And how many people can smile?" The meaning is profound.</p>
<p>In "Spring Comes to the World," there are street scenes, front street, back river, right wharf, left alley, all sides have scenes, the construction is extremely strong. According to the observation of general architects, the houses can be lived in for at least twenty years if they are really used for residence.</p>
<p>In "Spring Comes to the World," in addition to the big stars Chen Yanyan, Mei Xi, Han Langen, Liu Jiqun, Shang Guanwu, and Hong Jingling, Zhou Wenzhu is now invited to join in a cameo role. Zhou was a red star a few years ago. Her acting skills and dialogue are extremely skilled.</p>
<p>In "The General's Daughter," Li Qing is an unyielding partisan with an extremely tough personality. He was once captured by the general, and the general's daughter Li Zhuozhu did not hesitate to condescend to pursue him. The performance is sad and moving, attracting people.</p>
<p>When Han Langen and Bai Lu were filming "A Match Made in Heaven" and performing "Pulling Silk and Climbing Vines," her husband happened to come to the factory to visit. Han performed even more wonderfully and vividly. Mrs. Han was very embarrassed, and Director Shen was very satisfied.</p>
<p>Yin Xiucen, with his big belly, often used his belly to push people, and those who were pushed fell down, as if he had obtained the true transmission of "Iron Shirt."</p>
<p>Recently, due to the intense work, the photographers in the head office have not been able to allocate enough. In addition to the original two photographers, Huang Shaofen and Zhou Damin, two more photographers, Chen Chen and Shen Yongshi, have been hired to join the front line and work hard.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Eve of the New York Auto Show <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Nie Yu</p>
<p>All the new models of 1937 are on display, and the sky garden-style trailer will be exhibited at the venue for the first time. Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler will hold separate events.</p>
<p>New York Special Dispatch (November 8) The scale has increased significantly. The display area has expanded. The 37th National Automobile Exhibition, which holds great hope for the automobile business next year, will be held this Wednesday, European Armistice Peace Memorial Day, at 2 pm. The Central Palace of the Lansing Den Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets here. The session will last for eight days, closing at 11 pm on November 18.</p>
<h3 id="e221">New York Auto Show Emblem <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The exhibition time for this year's annual meeting has been slightly changed compared to previous years. Sunday will be open as usual, from noon to 10:30 PM. The opening will be on the third day of the week, which is a new precedent. In the past, exhibitions typically opened on Saturdays and Sundays and closed on the same day of the following week. This year, the exhibition time, except for the opening day and Sundays, is from 10:30 AM to 11:00 PM daily.</p>
<p>Holding the auto show in November is the second decision this year, replacing January with November. This method was implemented last year. The purpose is to enhance the employment stability of employees in the automotive industry and attract customers to purchase cars in the fall. It is said that it was quite effective in both aspects last year. Therefore, the Automobile Manufacturers Association, which hosts the exhibition, decided to continue using November as the date for this year's exhibition. They brought new 1937 models with them, hoping that the market they desired would immediately appear before their eyes, something unseen since 1929.</p>
<p>The passenger cars participating in the exhibition will represent twenty American car brands and five American car brands, totaling more than two hundred cars and chassis. In addition, various car parts and accessories will also be on display. Seven brands of trucks will be exhibited. American-made cars participating in the exhibition include Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Cord, DeSoto, Dodge, Duesenberg, Graham, Hudson, LaSalle, Nash, Lafayette, Willys, Studebaker, Terraplane, and Whippet. British brands include Essex, Austin, SS Jaguar, MG, and Lagonda.</p>
<p>Trailers participating in the exhibition will be participating in the auto show for the first time. It is said that there are many types. The entire fourth floor of the Central Palace has been designated for display. Approximately twenty-four or five well-known manufacturers will participate. All kinds of "homes on wheels" will be displayed separately, with no less than fifty models. This exhibit is expected to attract a special class of people, especially those who are fascinated by a nomadic or traveling lifestyle. The trailer lifestyle is currently booming. People in the automotive industry predict that its business scope will be no less than several million dollars.</p>
<p>One day during the conference will be designated as "International Day," which is quite meaningful and a feature of this year's exhibition. The participation of Central-made cars is a first. Germany, Sweden, and France have also decided to send official representatives to participate in the grand event. Individuals from countries such as Britain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, who are related to the automotive industry, will also attend and have already departed from their respective countries.</p>
<p>On Thursday, November 12th, the Traffic Safety Committee of the Automobile Manufacturers Association will hold a banquet at the Commodore Hotel. At that time, leaders engaged in automotive safety will discuss future vehicle safety measures. The annual banquet of the Society of Automotive Engineers will also be held on the same evening.</p>
<p>Ford Lincoln Exhibition: The 1937 Ford and Lincoln cars will not participate in the national auto show. However, in addition to being displayed at the Ford General Sales Office at 1710 Broadway, they can be viewed at the Astor Hotel and the Jardin des Roses. The exhibition period at these two locations is the same as the national auto show, from Wednesday noon to the evening of the 18th. The Astor Hotel's ballroom and its adjacent Rose and Laurel rooms have been decorated under the guidance of Mr. Teague. The color scheme adopts autumnal orange, yellow, and bronze tones. Various body styles of the Ford V-8 and Lincoln Zephyr cars will be displayed in the ballroom. The giant Lincoln V-12 and Lincoln Zephyr models will be exhibited separately in the Rose and Laurel rooms. The Ford V-8 truck display area is the mezzanine level of the ballroom.</p>
<p>In addition to various new cars, the grand ballroom of the Astor Hotel also features other interesting models. One group represents the important features of the Ford V-8 all-steel body and "center-balanced" chassis. The so-called "economic exhibition" includes a huge animated model of a Ford two-barrel downdraft carburetor, a "red light" engine showing its cycle of operation, and the fuel economy of the engine in operation. Another display shows the safety features of Ford cars. A display on "comfort and beauty" will utilize a luxurious white sedan, cut in half for examination.</p>
<p>General Motors Exhibition: General Motors will also hold a new car exhibition at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, with the same duration as the national auto show, a total of eight days. The venue will occupy the entire three floors of the hotel. The venue is decorated in mulberry and white, with a very novel layout. It is also trimmed with satin stainless steel. Various GM cars—Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, LaSalle, and Cadillac—will be the main features of the exhibition. Other aspects of General Motors' activities and related general automobiles will also be exhibited separately.</p>
<p>The center of the ballroom is a four-sided circular wall, made of translucent paint, with a 30-foot-high illuminated tower pillar. The base of the tower is decorated with huge custom-made glass mirrors. Through the mirrors, you can see the "traffic dynamics" of the cars. It is expected that the most attractive exhibit in the venue will be a "cut-in-half" car, which will be displayed in the most prominent place in the hall. This "split car" is automatically managed and is said to be the first attempt to show a direct cross-section of the operation of a modern car to the public. The work of cutting the car in half is a successful project of the General Motors Experimental Factory, and it will take several months to complete. Fisher Body will exhibit its new "Turret Top" all-steel body, which is standard equipment on all 1937 General Motors cars.</p>
<p>The research department of the General Motors exhibition will display a "living room on wheels." The purpose is to show the comfort of General Motors cars and the average family. The standard seats in the 1937 model cars can be converted into practical sofas. Other modern car living room parts such as stoves, radios, ashtrays, car lamps, etc., can be arranged into a perfect family.</p>
<p>The Carl Hoff Radio Orchestra will perform every afternoon during the conference to entertain the guests.</p>
<p>Chrysler Auto Show: The Chrysler International Auto Show opened yesterday. The venue is on the first and second floors of the Chrysler Building. It is expected that many people will visit in the next few days. The main products on display are Plymouth, Dodge, DeSoto, and Chrysler. The layout of the venue is quite distinctive, such as rotating exhibitions and invisible glass, which are unprecedented. The lighting is also very novel, and there are exhibitions of winter and summer air conditioning. A separate room is also opened in the venue to show films about the company's products. The exhibitions of Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler are all free. The admission fee for the national auto show is 55 cents before 6 PM and 75 cents after 6 PM, including ticket donations.</p>
<h3 id="e222">New Streamlined Long-Distance Buses <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Mo</p>
<p>Increased Riding Comfort and Power</p>
<p>The transportation business of trains, especially passenger transportation, has recently been encroached upon by long-distance buses in many places. As a result, several railway companies in the United States lowered passenger fares this summer to attract customers. At the same time, they have been making every effort to improve equipment, such as adopting streamlined vehicles, diesel engines, and adding air conditioning for heating and cooling. These are all methods to attract passenger traffic. On the other hand, bus companies are unwilling to show weakness. In the past, they only competed on fares and convenience, but now they are changing their strategy and making great efforts in equipment, speed, and comfort. We only need to look at the "Super Trend Buses" of the "Greyhound" line, one of the giants in the American long-distance bus industry, to understand that the progress of long-distance buses has been very significant.</p>
<p>These modern "Super Trend Buses" are manufactured by General Motors. They are quite different from old-fashioned long-distance buses in appearance. The front of the car is not sharp, and part of the engine has been removed, so the appearance is very unique. The streamlined shape of the whole body maintains a moderate style, not too large. At first glance, it gives people the impression of diffused power, solid structure, and light and smooth flow. The first batch of new cars totals 325 vehicles.</p>
<p>The exterior of the car body is decorated with metal, which is dazzling and exceptionally novel and pleasing. Because of the rear engine, the front of the car gradually slopes backward from the rubber bumper to the roof, which is very attractive. The driver's seat is located at the front of the car, which is very high, making it sufficient to clearly see the oncoming traffic and the road conditions ahead. It is indeed much better than the old-fashioned cars. This is due to his superior land pull and the green of the insurance glass's large windshield.</p>
<p>The passenger's position has also been greatly increased. Above the shaking money, noise and dust can be avoided a lot. Passengers can look over the roofs of oncoming buses from the unbreakable windows. In terms of comfort, because the "seat on wheels" is completely eliminated, all seats are uniformly comfortable. The vibration of the axles and wheels will not disturb passengers.</p>
<p>Although the passenger seats are raised, the center of gravity of the entire car is greatly lowered than before. In this way, extraordinary convenience is obtained in terms of safety and carrying capacity. The entire high-rise part of the car body has also been eliminated. The seats in the car are very thick and soft. The chair frame is made of magnesium and aluminum metal, which is very pleasing to the eye. The cushions are deep and soft, and the headrests are scientifically designed. There are also movable armrests. The seats can be freely changed in position. There are four different positions for guests to choose from. You can look at the scenery, read newspapers, rest, or doze off. Passengers who are tall and have long legs can also obtain considerable comfort in the car, because the legroom between the seats has increased a lot compared to the past.</p>
<p>Although the legroom for passengers in the car has been widened, the space of the entire car has also increased at the same time. This "Super Trend Bus" can carry 36 passengers, compared to only 23 in the past. This larger space is obtained by extending the carriage to the original motorcycle position. The carriage is spacious and unobstructed. There are no obstacles, because many hand-carried luggage are placed in the lower carriage, which is completely separated from the passenger seats, which makes it even more comfortable. Some racks are installed above the seats, specially prepared for guests to place small packages and other items. Guests can board the car from the ground with just one step. It is an embedded corridor that is the same as the length of the entire car. The seats are one step above this corridor. The interior of the car is completely modernized, with bright painted panels and metal trim. The lighting also safely adopts new styles. The car top is decorated with Mossa glass. The light is illuminated from the inside, soft and gorgeous, with a special flavor.</p>
<p>The engine power of the "Super Trend Bus" is very large. It is installed at the rear of the car, parallel to the rear axle. This installation method not only increases power and efficiency, but also has extraordinary quietness and stability in terms of sound and action. The vibration is reduced, and the breath when it is extinguished is also separated from the engine location and the passenger compartment, which is very strict, so the vibration is less. There are two compartments on the bottom floor of the car, which are built very tightly. Water and dust will not invade at all. This is specially used to place clothing boxes, suitcases, and large packages. The luggage racks on the car top, which were commonly seen in buses, have been completely eliminated. The luggage storage compartment has a door that opens directly to the outside, so you can put it in or take it out at will. When the car is running, the door is completely closed. The luggage transport capacity of this new car is much greater than that of the old-fashioned ones in the past. Most of the new car is made of sturdy aluminum metal, so the structural strength is very great and can increase the weight by two tons.</p>

<p>American Movie Stars Buy Packard: Packard cars are elegant and luxurious, and have been favored by the propertied class. According to a recent survey by Mr. Asana, a Packard car dealer in California, more than one hundred famous movie stars in the United States have purchased Packard cars. According to Mr. Sang, Hollywood is a concentration of various beautiful and new things, and it takes the lead in opening up trends, which is related to the observation of all parties. The large Packard and 120 models are all there, which is enough to make outsiders yearn for them. Especially in the gathering places of famous movie stars, directors, etc., Packard is even more of a leading car at the time. Mr. Sang also said that Hollywood things, in addition to being beautiful, must also have the elements of practicality and need. Packard's style is exquisite and can complement the stars, and so on.</p>
<p>Car Radio: The radio business in the United States is developing rapidly. It is estimated that the sales of radios in the first half of this year have exceeded the peak of 1935. Production is up 15% to 25%, and sales are up 15% to 30%. Among them, the installation of radios in cars is even more improved. In the six months from January to June this year, the sales of car radios exceeded those of 1935 by 30% to 150%. At the end of 1935, only 17% of cars had registered radios, with a number of 3,900,000 passenger cars. It is estimated that the number will reach 5,000,000 by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Interesting Car Analysis: According to the "Automobile Facts and Figures" published by the American Automobile Association in 1936, the total wholesale value of cars and parts manufactured in the United States in 1935 was US$3,319,973. The number of cars manufactured in the United States last year was 4,119,811. The total number of employees directly or indirectly employed in automobile manufacturing and sales exceeded 6,600,000, of which 439,000 were directly employed in the manufacture of automobiles and their components. The wages they received in 1935 were $657,332,000. The number of cars produced in 1935 and the value obtained from sales were almost 200% higher than in 1932, one of the worst years for the automobile industry. The value of a car in 1935 was calculated by pound and horsepower, with the following results. The average price of a car in 1935 was 21 cents per pound, compared to 38 cents per pound in 1925. In terms of horsepower, the price of a car per horsepower last year was US$7, while in 1925 it was US$27.50.</p>
