<p>成立與去年十月間</p>
<p>倫敦　據本社海軍訪員所知、法意兩國對於邀請德國參加一層、表示遲疑、惟此事尚屬次要、蓋目前最重要者係主力艦噸位問題、英美兩國主張三萬五千噸、而法意兩國、則要求减至二萬七千噸、各執一詞、堅持不下、其情形已足使四國協定之前途、感受妨害、就法意兩國觀察、英國原來主張以二萬五千噸為主力艦之噸位、會目法國所提二萬七千噸之數字為過高、今乃突然改變態度、殊難索解、若干政界人士以為英美兩國業於去年十月成立秘密協定、其內容外間尚無所知、英國對於主力艦噸位問題之所以遷就美國主張者、職是故也、（三日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>倫敦　關於邀請德國參加海軍會議一項問題、英國官塲人士頃宣稱、英國在四國海軍協定磋商就緒之前、不擬遽行邀請德國參加、但以爲海軍協定非具有普遍性質或具有相當普遍之性質、則難望其發生實效、英國現正考慮、一俟四國協定磋商就緒之後、卽行邀請德國曁其他各國參加、至此項問題在會議中迄未提出討論、法國亦尙未表示異議云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英國採取了攻勢　（下）</h3>
<p>— Louis　Fisher作賓符譯</p>
<p>——殺氣籠罩下的歐局觀察之一——</p>
<p>因華爾華爾邊境事件發生和塞拉西向日內瓦吿訴之故，阿比西尼亞問題完全入於國聯的懐抱中，而倫敦則堅决地加以維護。這就是鮑爾溫政府獲得國內擁護的原因，在其國內大量的和平投票上正顯示着不列顚人民對於集體安全的熱望是如何的深切而純粹。牠因此也獲得國際的贊助，因爲各國都惟恐侵略的成功會把歐洲曳入第二决大戰去。假使背着國聯在巴黎或別的地方締訂了恊定，日內瓦也許就會軟下來，而英國的海上示威常然也不見得有什麽花樣。不列顚駐地中海的艦隊，從一九三五年八月五日的二十三萬噸起，現在已很快的增加到五十萬噸了。自從一九一八年以來，不列顚遠不曾採取過這樣堅决的行動。這是隨着國聯九十月間决定的軍火封鎖財政封鎖和經濟制裁的自然結果。</p>
<p>國聯和非國聯會員國參與制裁的迅速和一致，正反映着意大利道德上的孤立和物質上的貧弱以及英國一往不返的决心。一個有力的侵略者對付一個渺小的國家，也許比對付日內瓦容易多。正因如此，制裁實是一種會有許多道德成分的好方法。這種方法，雖然遲緩，郤是嚴峻而普遍，不致引起實際的報復。牠固然不能立卽阻止戰爭，但郤能限制那加速危機的日常軍用消耗。不久以前，在日內瓦，巴黎，和倫敦，我曾聽到有許多人討論着如果墨索里尼或法西斯蒂在意國的地位一旦危殆，制裁是吾繼續下去的問題。制裁自然儘能立卽撤回。但最大問題就是：英國究竟打算幹到怎樣？人們每天可以聽到犧牲阿比西尼亞的「卑鄙計劃」的謠言。一會兒英國大使在羅馬見黑衣相，一會兒賴伐爾召集討論阿比西尼亞問題的談話，一切盛傳的計劃都是想給意大利一些滿足。英前外相霍爾不是說「我們對於意大利擴展的需要並非沒有同情」嗎？他也贊成重行分配世界原料的。</p>
<p>英國的政策爲甚麽猶移不定呢？理由是很多的。但都可以歸納於一個範圍中。不列顚的有力界不要墨索里尼坍台；他們是在替歐洲資本主義的前途着想。英國也許還需耍意大利的帮助以抗法德。一個被制裁或戰敗以後的意大利也許會馴良地放棄對不列顚帝國的陰謀和侵奪非洲的野心。因此給意大利些微的土地，對於大不列顚毫無危險，而且還可借此消釋英意的仇視。然而，假使意國竟不受英國的調解而跟德國手携着手把全歐滾入戰爭中，又將怎樣呢？這當然不是英國之所望。他們决不能使墨紫里尼威到沒有調解的餘地。不列顚的軍備擴張論者誠然說墨索里尼的飛機可以毀滅不列顚的艦隊。其實，不列顚除了現有力量外，還有着國聯做後盾，對意大利是敵之有餘的。英國的困難卻是在於她有三方面的前綫——遠東，地中海，和北海或中歐。她確乎需要着三副海軍。當倫敦在地中海前綫動了員，其他二處前綫也必須保持活躍的狀態。這就是不列顚根本脆弱的又一大因素。不列顚的力量給日本的侵華或德國最近的威脅所分散了，對於墨索里尼的帮助，眞無過於此。這就是在意阿糾紛中爲什麽英國政府想不惜犧牲國聯以先與法國或德國妥恊。兩者之中大槪是出於英法軍事的合作，這問題現在又甚囂塵上了。</p>
<p>今日東非的戰事不禁使人想起了法沙達事件。當法沙達事件的前後，英國殖民部長張伯倫（Joseph　Chamberlain）想與德國聯結，德國不理。一八九九年的春天，正當英法解决蘇丹事件之前，法國向德國要求聯盟，德國又不理。不久英法遂訂立恊的以制德了。現在因英意矛盾的結果，也許會產生另一種的結合或衝突。任何事情沒有比這變幻多端的了。東非的殖民戰爭是正在替歐洲第二幕的活劇佈置幕景吧。</p>
<p>這也是很明顯的：不列顚的孤立，不論是光榮的或卑鄙的，已是告終了。只有一個非常强勁的不列顚纔能獨自立足。帝國和歐陸兩者的選擇已成爲純粹的胡說。在歐陸上沒有不列顚的勢力就不能有帝國。每個爭執的邊疆，每個潛在的火藥庫，都是不列顚的事情，保守黨的新內閣應當顧到這一點。英國需要着友人，英國也應建立較大的航空艦隊和精良的海軍。在未建立以前，她應避免弱點的暴露。愛好和平者都以爲集體安全已有了保障，有了國聯就可以减削英國的軍備預算。然而唐寗街是知道日內瓦的價値的。牠也知道在今日混亂的世界中，最後的保障還是在於力量。在歐洲，軍備的競爭和英國的夠心鬭角還只是一個開端呢。</p>

<h3>怎樣使學生算學成績好？</h3>
<p>— 大夏大學敎授　任孟閑</p>
<p>（一月十四日十六日對全國中等學校學生講）</p>
<p>怎樣使學生算學成績好？凡擔任算學敎學的人，總常常有這問題盤旋在腦海裏。關係於這問題的方面也很多，遠的大的且不談，比較切近的，如學校行政，學校訓育，課程編製，班級大小，以及學生入學程度，升級標準，學習興趣、和他們努力的情形，都與算學成績有密切的關係，僅僅在敎師本身求解决，是不可能的。但若專就敎師一方面講，據我所知：有的敎師新從大學畢業，學問很好但敎起書來，不見得怎樣高明，甚至有從外國留學回來的，所學非常高深，而不能勝任中學的敎職；所能有人說，白學與敎人是兩件事，眞學者未必良敎師。也有敎書已久，經騐很多，但學生成績，依然不良，或且愈趨愈下的，所以又有人說，經騐不必要，只要學過的總能敎。這兩說究竟誰是誰非呢？我承認敎書必須有學問，但我不承認有學問的不能敎書。因為他的學問，如果足以敎人，豈有不受人歡迎的這理？所謂有學問而不善敎，這是敎書失敗的人自己原諒自己的話。我也不承認有了學問便能敎書，或有了經騐便夠敎書，新畢業的，外國留學的，學問雖高明，但沒有敎過書，或根本就沒有學過怎樣敎書，當然敎不好。老敎師僅憑老經騐，而不求新知識不想新方法，或者敎書雖已多年，並未留心研究，則亦無所謂經騐，有方法又有研究，是否便夠成一個理想的敎師？這還要看他的人格和精神怎樣。所以算學敎師——尤其是要使學生成績好的敎師，必須注意下列三件事：</p>
<p>三件事：</p>
<p>第一，實質的修養　理想的敎師，學力和經騐，是缺一不可的。而學力如何充實？又可公　養和　修兩方面　：</p>
<p>養　算學是一個有理論而要證明，有方法而要實行，系統　分明，應用又廣泛的學科，所以算學敎師，須有：</p>
<p>一，高深的理論　中學校所敎，雖限於算術代數幾何三角和解析幾何，但敎師如各科都敎，學力固當豊富，即只敎一科或兩科，也當各有其較高的修養，如敎代數三角而不明函數的性質，則如何變値，如何變跡，實數怎樣？虛數怎樣？必隨時感覺模糊；敎幾何而不知近世幾何的性質，則遇有較繁的證明，或較難的作圖，又必到處棘手。所以敎的儘管淺，而學的則不可不較深。誰說在大學裏所學的微積分函數論以及近世代數高等幾何等，做中學敎師時，一切用不着！</p>
<p>二，普通的常職　敎師的學職，若祇限於所敎的一門，是很危險的事。凡敎代數的，不得不講幾何，如方程式不等工的圖解等，敎幾何的不得不用代數，如作圖的解析，面積及體積的極限等，這都是當然的事實；而一經應用到各方面，則有時須講理化，有時須講社會學科，有時更須講工商業務。雖無須有專精的研究，有時更須講工商業務。雖無須有專精的研究，但普通的常識，總是必備的；尤其是代數敎到選擇與機會兩章，相關的事項更雜，如音樂，如運動，甚至賽馬賭博，各項規章，都要明瞭，這是多麼廣泛啊！</p>
<p>三，基本運算的技能　上項說過：三角的基礎在代數幾何，解析幾何的基礎又在代數幾何及三角，而無論何科的基礎，則者在算術。學算學該如此，敎算學更該如此。假使敎師敎解析幾何時，代數式變化不熟，三角術運用不靈，則關於軸移，參變數的消去等，都不易達到簡單的結果；而解決任何問題，最後的一步，總不外加减乘除，若敎师於数字的計算，手續緩慢，或常有錯誤，則正角的解答，更不易得。如何能消除學生的　團，增進學生的興趣呢？所以敎師對於基本運算的技能，必須有充分的訓練。</p>
<p>四，所敎學科的必得　任何學科，雖按着次序一章一節的敎下去，但敎師對於該科全部，當澈底了解，有獨到的心得，有鳥瞰的眼光，切忌枝節片斷地順文解義，毫無引伸。如欲求任一角柱的　積，須先計算三角柱，欲計算三角柱，須先　究平行六面體，而任意平行六面體，又與同底同高直角平行六面體相等，故若直角平行六面體體積的量法，則任一角柱體的體積自明，然此非敎師先有透視的功夫，不克提示清楚。又如高中代數普通的敎本，除初部屬於複習性質外，大都列舉諸法，前後幾不相關，敎師尤當統觀全書，設法聯絡。至於前節敎過，次節若不經準備，便不能講解的敎師，自然有失敗之虞。</p>
<p>進修　學識的根底雖深，平素的修養雖好，但學術進步，一日千里，若不能適應時代，作進一步的探討，從不落伍，亦將停止在某一個階段，而無向上進化的可能。故理想的敎師，必須且敎且學，不必再入何校，或留學何國，亦可繼續進修。進修的方法：即多讀新書和有名的雜誌。常見敎師案頭，除現用敎本和在學生時代讀過的幾本敎科書外，更無其他任何書籍，其所在學校的設備又甚簡單，致所敎各科，乃一無參考資料，似此情形，鳥能進步！故敎師最好儘其力之所能，擇要自置新書和有我聽雖誌；必不得已，亦當設法借閱；若直接與所敎有益的刋物，更應多讀幾種，庶所見不致偏於一隅。此外加參加學術團體，及出席學術講演會或講習會等，藉以接受新知，解决疑問，這都是補充敎師修養的良好機會，敎師應該充分的利用起來。</p>
<p>經騐是修養的又一方面，不過不是在學校護書時，也不是在服務後進修時所可獲得的。換句話：這種修養，不是從書本中學來的知識，而是從實際敎學上得着的敎訓。如敎師初敎某某科或第一次選用某某敎科書，書中何處可省略？何處當補充？何處較易不妨較快進行？何處較雜必須詳為講解？一槪不得而知。必待用到二三次，始可參加已意。其他類此的實際問題，必須經地安富尊榮地的一再試騐，　能較有辦法的例子很多，敎師隨時隨地都可遭遇着。但新畢業的敎師，常自命學識高深，對於所敎學科，看得太淺，以為略出所學，便可施敎，一切實際問題的有無，都顧不到，更談不到如何去解决問題。或是敎書多年的，用慣了幾本書，做慣了幾百個習題，一學期又一學期，總是這樣敎下去，對於環境和所敎的對象，旣無所謂新的感　，更不覺得有什麼懷疑，這兩種敎師，一是毫無經騐，一是雖存經騐而等謚無，都不能使學生成績好。所以理想的敎師，不可不重視經騐，而最有價値的經騐，莫如：</p>
<p>客觀的認識　敎師對於敎學的方法，誠不可不有理想。但若僅憑主觀的想像，而不顧實際如何，則理論雖多，經騐方面仍一無收穫。故經騐必根據事實，即敎學的經騐，當從敎學本身上求。如學生聽講進所提問題；演習時所有錯誤或曲解；考試時所表現的成績等，都可使敎師觸起一種確切的反映，足以證明所敎是否適當而有效。所謂「敎學相長」，實是不可磨滅的名言！</p>
<p>失敗後的覺悟　幸運的敎師，或因學生程度齊，可以照預定的理想去做；或因學生對於所敎的向來不注意，不論敎得如何，從不感受困難；然對象一經改變，便會發生問題。其實敎師决不易为，算學敎師尤不許隨便，任何學力充足的人，總不能自保其不失敗，但若因失敗而覺悟，因覺悟而改良，則多一次失敗，即多一次經騐，多一次經騐，便少一次失敗。如此由艱苦備嘗中得來的經騐，最為確實而可靠，親切而有味，所謂「失敗乃成功之母」，是誰也不能否認的！</p>
<p>不過丫經騐，還要能辦別，能整理，知道什麼是對的，就繼續下去，知道什麼是不對的，就改正過來，否則零碎片段，是非雜糅，有何用處？所以敎師果能在得着經騐之後，更加以適當的考慮，寫出幾條有系統的經騐結果來以備將來自已應用，且可供他人參考，則他的敎學成績，那得不蒸蒸日上呢？如此善用以騐的敎學成績，那得不蒸蒸日上呢？如此善用經騐的敎師，一方面是增進修養，一方面便是研究方法，良好而實用的敎學法，就是這樣得到的啊！</p>
<p>第二，方法的研究　小學敎師，誰也不否認敎學必須有方法，而中學則不然。近且有人主張中學師資，毋庸特別訓練，凡在大學畢業的，總可本其所學，到中學裏去敎書。即出身於高等師範的人，有時也只注意於敎材，而忽略其敎法。嘗見敎師不自覺悟其敎學所以失敗及學生成績所以不良的原因，輒自嗚其學問未必不如人，或痛斥學生為不屑敎，而不知敎學有無效果，除敎師的實質而外，即視乎方法如何，尤其是算學乃一般人認為難學的學科，更非有方法的敎師，不能使學生的成績好。</p>
<p>中學算學敎學法的內容是什麼？非短時間所能　述，槪括地說：有敎學原則，敎學程序，成績考查等；分類地說：有算術敎學法，代數敎學法，幾何三角敎學法等；凡此種種，無非大學敎育學院或高師科所授學程中所研究的事項，而且都有　書可讀，用不清我多講。我惟就常用的幾種敎學法，及關於課後處理的問題，　獻一點意見。</p>

<h3>顧馨一　談滬工商業</h3>
<p>發行新公債可免人利用投機　各業現欵交易减少自身危險</p>
<p>年來國內因受世界經濟不景氣影饗、使工商業一蹶不振、去歲雖經當局竭力設法、以謀救濟、但一時尙難求其復甦、故總結束時、對於收集客帳、均無起色、爰經各業議定於本年度始、各貨均以現欵交易為主、中央社記者特往訪豆米業同業公會主席顧馨一氏、據談如决、</p>
<p>現欵交易　以便周轉　本市雖為全國工商業之中心、但以受世界經濟不景氣之影響、各種營業、均一蹶不振、為銀錢業、對於工商業投資、除押匯押欵外、於信用放欵、其數甚微、以致各業周轉為困難、而營業範圍、亦不得不力事緊縮、本年度始各業均有以現欵交易之决定、此雖於營業發展上、大受影響、但為减少自身之危險、亦不得已而出此、</p>
<p>擁護發行兩新公債　此决財政部發行統一復興二公債、對於工商業之繁榮、關係極為重大、過去公債之發行、其實際可得之利息、往往在一分以上、故一般銀錢業及富有財力者、極願投資於公債、乃至利用公債而從事投機、此不獨對於國家財富、受有影響、對於工商業所關允非淺鮮、蓋投資工商業、其所得之利益、恐尙不及公債之厚、今决公債之發行、可使一般具有財力、樂於投資工商業、而工商業在經濟上之週轉、當較前為好、故工商業對於財政部發行新公債一案、絕對表示擁戴云、</p>

<h3>上海之捲煙業</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之十二）</p>
<p>一，沿革我國吸烟之習慣甚早，除流毒甚深之鴉片外，早知將菸葉切成細絲，以銅製之水烟筒，或竹製之旱烟管，隨裝隨吸，頗形麻煩。故自捲烟由外洋輸入以來，其流行範圍遂日益擴大，演至今日，幾凡窮鄕僻境，亦皆有捲烟之踪跡矣；此無他，蓋捲烟式樣新穎，携帶燃吸，均較其他之烟為便利也。</p>
<p>考捲烟最初輸入，的在一八九〇年（即民國紀元前廿二年）前後，經營最早者，為美商老晋隆，當時每年價値僅數十萬元，嗣後逐年增加，民國六年竟增至四千餘萬元，實堪驚人。同時英美商人又於民國紀允前十年，在上海漢口等地設立英美烟公司分廠，就地製造。其勢更雄。至國人自辦捲烟之興起，則甚遲緩，直至民國紀元前七年前後，始有所聞，當時因美國禁止華工人境，國人大受刺激，捲烟業方面，亦起而自謀獨立，如上海之三星公司及德隆烟廠，北平之大衆公司，天津之北洋公司，及廣州之南洋公司，皆為當時美國排華浪潮所激起。惟因資本短少，經騐不足，不數年間，南洋卽吿改組，其他各廠竟吿收歇，嗣歐戰爆發，洋貨不能源源輸入，華商烟廠，頗能趁機活躍，迨五卅事變發生以後，全國仇英心理甚熾，華商烟廠，風起雲湧，較歐戰時更形發達，當時風行全國之大英牌香烟，（英美烟公司出品）暫吿絕跡，卽可想見。惟民國十七年以後，因政府增加稅額，同時外貨傾銷，華商烟廠，卽現衰落景象，近年更為不振，（其詳情參閱本文第三節）。今將上海華商烟廠（設廠自行製造者）。歷年所存廠數統計如左：民五七，民十九，民十四五一，民十五一〇五，民十六一八二，民十七九四，民二十六四，民廿三四六。</p>
<p>（註：數字根據上海銀行調查部編於與菸業及中國銀行民國廿三年營業報吿書，至專製雪茄烟者，則未包括在內。）</p>
<p>上海為全國工商業之重心，故上海一埠捲烟業之興衰，足代表全國捲烟業之榮枯。（未完）</p>

<p>敎育新聞</p>
<h3>公共租界　去年敎育槪況</h3>
<p>私校補助金總額三十七萬餘　華童學校敎員增聘華人</p>
<p>公共租界工局敎育處處長、一九三五年度報吿書、茲已繕呈董事會、其中關於公共租界華人敎育設施、西童及日本兒童學校槪况、以及局立學校辦理進展情形、非局立學校補助金之支配等等、叙述甚詳、茲特擇其概要、先為披露如下、該報吿書中有云、迄目前為止、局立華童小學、現巳成立五所、學生總數三千三百二十名、並有設備完善西厦一所、供作華籍女子中學校舍之用、在西童學校方面、有二女校巳合併為一、佔一新式寬大校址、並在西區建築適常房屋一所、作為西童小學之用、</p>
<p>私立學校補助金額　關於私立學校補助金一節、在一九三一年、僅西人設立學校五所、受有工部局補助金、至一九三二年、華人踵起交涉、始有華人私立學校補助金之頒發、一九三五年度、是項補助金頒發之總數、為三十七萬七千七百六十元、內分私立華校二十萬零八千七百六十元、私立西校十六萬九千元、惟此項補助金額、為數有限、而界內私立學校調查合格者極　、僧多粥少、難以支配、斯亦私立學校補助金特別審查委員會、本度支年內所最感困難者也、冉則日童學校以辦理虧累、要求工部局增加補助金、經工部局另撥特別補助費一萬元、因之是年日章學校　所、共領補助金十萬八千元、連同以上日童學校、公共租界私立西校共十三所學牛總數九千二百九十二名、去年共領補助金十　萬九千兀、較之前年增加約十分之一、至華人私立學校之請領補助金者、較之前年大見激增、是年查騐合格學校、計共一百八十九所、較之一九三四年超出四十四所、是年所領補助金之總數、為一十萬另八千七百六十元、較之前歲、亦增加的略十分之一、是項金額之中、有六千元、係用以改良某某等校校舍者、各校之中、計有中學三十二所、小學一百五十七所、學生總數三萬七千八百零八名、茲復將近年來、中西各私立學校領取補助余之數目、列舉如下</p>
<p>華校、一九三一年、無、一九三二年、十一萬三千九百八十六元、一九三三年、十三萬八千八百十一元、一九三四年、十八萬六千三百七十五元、一九三五年、二十萬零八千七百六十元、</p>
<p>西校、一九三一年、十萬零七千六百九十二元、一九三二年、同前、一九三三年、十四萬一千六百零八元、一九三四年、十五萬三千八百五十元、一九三五年、十六萬九千元、</p>
<p>一九三五年度報吿　復云、是年因財政上之支絀、原有敎育建築計劃、不得不繼續停頓、惟董事會巳議决日後財政狀况、稍有起色之時、即常將原有計劃、重加愼重之考慮、在華人敎育施設方面、去年年終、巳由董事會議决、利用文監帥路西童男校舊址、添設華童小學一所、一九三六年、若無其他事故發生、此校開創一切經費、即當列入預算之中、</p>
<p>局立華童學校概况工部局女子中學、設於新加坡路九號、校舍係新式之建築、學生五百名、俱受最近代之敎育及訓練、現局立華童學校、計共日校十所、夜校一所、學生總數六千三百八十三名、較之一九三一年、巳增加二千八百六十名、成百分之八十一、</p>
<p>一九三四年中、工部局學務處、曾有小組委員會之設立、調查局立華童中學五所、舉行會考、以袪離校時程度差池不齊之弊、後經通過、呈請董事會批准下列議案之條、</p>
<p>一九三五年六月局立華童中學五所、舉行由部會考於中心地點、其試題應照各校現有課程、力求一致、並留選擇及交換之餘地、以適合各校課程之範圍、</p>
<p>某某種科學、由局外人考試一節、暫緩舉行、留待各校功課劃一程度、及參加敎育局中學會考人數確定之後、再予置議、</p>
<p>局立中學學生、應予以參加敎育局中學會考之鼓勵、</p>
<p>以上各議决案、實因目前各校功課、尙未能一律相同、亦不便操切從事、務使劃一、至局立中學學生、使之參加上海市敎育局會考一節、係因工部局設立各中學、巳經國民政府敎育部加以特別承認、故學生儘可自行參加中國當局舉行之考試也、</p>
<p>嗣後局立五中學第一决會考、係於六月上旬行於格致公學、時復有考試委員會之組織、以五校校長為主腦、而輔以各校同等數目之考試員、參加會考者、有高中三年級學生五十五名、考試及格頒給畢業證書者四十名、其中成續優良、平均分數在八十分以上者十五名、列為優等、此一九三五年局立中學會考之大概也、</p>
<p>西籍敎員逐漸減少　依照工部局原有方針、局立各華董學校敎職應儘量聘任華人、以代西籍敎員、故一九三五年春初、工部局學務處對於各校西籍敎員之是吾可再行核减、曾加詳細之討論、嗣經考慮之結果、决定先行聘請華籍敎員若干人、講授科學、數學等功課、徐待日後、再當聘請華籍敎員敎授英文功課、</p>
<p>與此事有關者、如各校報告書中、大抵稱學生中文研究、顯有長足之進步、即如育才公學學生、對於中文作文、進步頗覺顯著、思想體裁、俱有可觀、共他如公民地理等功課、成績亦極佳、該校圖書館中、並已添置多量中國書籍、於學生之　摩上、裨益實非淺鮮也、再則格致公學報吿書中亦云、該校去年、巳有西籍敎員二人吿退、故低級學生之英文、巳改用華籍敎員授課、惟每級仍留西籍英文敎員數人、以免更張過速之弊、地理巳改用中文本、其他科學數學、亦在逐漸改用華文講授之中、而以低級為引用之開端、再則該校當局為鼓勵學生中文作文起見、每級擇其成績優異者、頒給特別槳品、此亦可見局立各校、重視中文之一斑也、</p>
<p>球類運動日漸發達　工部局設立各華童學校年終報吿書、概分中學小學二種、以各中學（內女中一所）普通報吿而論、學生工作大抵要靜而勤勉、惟學生對於體育、以及各種運動、興趣日增、即如育才公學內、學生之加人各項運動者、人數突見躍增、學校前此紀錄之打破者、居然有四項之多、聶中丞公學之足球、籃球隊及排球隊、成績俱屬可觀、女子中學內、除去注重體育之外、學生對於會社生活、亦極重視、其中有戲劇會、辯論會、舞蹈會等組織云、</p>
<p>小學方面、一九三五年春季及秋季學生總數、一為三千一百六十九、一為三千二百四十九、上課成分為百分之九十二、各校報名人數、大致超出定額甚遠、而允以新閘路西區小學為甚、至各校功課、大抵依照敎育部定章進行、</p>

<h3>兒童敎育小說　小男兒　（一）（六）（七）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>這個招認狀，寫得並不好，字蹟也草草率率，留着許多墨點，又是很短；可是唐恩視為至寳；等到裴先生讀了以後，唐恩跑到他的身旁，兩眼淸明，熊度樸實而恭敬，——這是他們一直敎導他如此的——却略帶顫聲說道：</p>
<p>「我說我不應說謊，請求你饒恕我，先生」，</p>
<p>「這是好意的虛謊，唐恩，我不能不饒恕這個，可是你看這是不中用的」，裴先生說道，一手各放在一個肩上，臉上充滿了愛憐與寬慰之情。</p>
<p>「這使得童子們不致再去難為乃德。這是我做那件事的用意。他吃不起痛苦，我倒是無所謂的」，唐恩說着，彷彿在忍痛的久久沉默以後，很爽快把心事和盤托。</p>
<p>「你怎麼可以呢？你待我眞正好喲」，乃德戰抖着說道，他恨不得去抱住他的朋友痛哭一場；這兩者却都是兒女子的情態，假如他果眞做了，恐怕唐恩反要學得羞　得無地可以自容呢。</p>
<p>「現在一切都好了，老朋友，所以不要再做傻子了」，他說道，咽下了喉嚨裏一大塊的委曲，暢暢快快大笑了一陣，這是他幾星期來所沒有的。他隨又急切問道；不知裴夫人知道了沒有」？</p>

<h3>阿比西尼亞的畫</h3>
<p>— （寗兪）</p>
<p>我曾經在什麽地方看到阿比亞尼亞的畫。題材差不多是關於戰爭和宗敎的：阿人和意大利人的一八九六年的阿杜華戰爭，伊甸園，惡和善的戰爭等等。它們有一個最引人注意的特徵，便是好人總畫正面而壞人只有側面。譬如：跟阿國開戰的意大利人統統是給畫成側面的的，她自己的丘八郤個個正面；雖然他們的土槍正對凖着那敵人。</p>
<p>這種沒有透視的，特殊的手法，用藝術的眼光看來，似乎是很幼稚。不過，它們激起我的莫名的偏愛。</p>
<p>中國有那樣類似的表現，是在戲劇上的臉譜的應用。拿不同的顏色和勾筆來分明人的善惡，技巧地像煞進步了些。但有許多觀衆不懂那個區別，反而沒有阿國的明白了。</p>
<p>所以我想：假使把世上的人眞實地分了善惡，用阿畫的方法表現出來；做人不是要比現在容易得多？最低限度叫人瞧着也可觀呼幾聲！衹是我以為應該把好人畫成側面，壞人畫成正面，因為如今是壞人正面的世界了。</p>
<h3>雕刻矮鼓</h3>
<p>— 陳與齡</p>
<p>矮鼓，閩侯人，佚其姓名，身短而腹皤，遂呼為矮鼓。閩山多產木，其根之拘攀蟠結者，最稱堅實，木工鐫以為人物花卉之屬，而矮鼓之技獨精。顧矮鼓有奇癖，每受傭値，必用罄而後治業，甕有餘粟，恒舍業以嬉。遨遊公卿間，未嘗足恭以取容悅。螺江陳部郎子長，弢庵太傳之先德也，召矮鼓使鐫木。陳氏門祚鼎盛，願指氣使習為常，未及假矮鼓以辭色。矮鼓心弗善也；則漫應之，久而未吿竣，趣葳事輒推宕，遣僕觀之，則胚胎猶未具也。怒而拘諸官。矮鼓入獄不自聊，以所業遣時，遂成人物數事，返諸部郎，獄始解，前都轉劉步溪遇矮鼓獨厚，至則餉以酒食，及它所嗜叧，矮鼓醉飽，已即竟去，他日至如之。矮鼓旣數擾主人，則亦欲然，乃詢主人曰：「有嘉木欲付鐫乎。」劉氏儲木富，擇尤授矮鼓，弗責以程期，而矮鼓必報命，且加工焉。矮鼓有徒某，雕鎪人物亦可觀。矮鼓曰，「若能磨治而已，不足言刀法也，凡刀貴振主，而若咸平偃。」徒曰！「請語所以振拔之道。」矮鼓曰「此不可言喩也。」矮鼓殆有所秘耶，抑藝事信若　耶。市有影印端木氏手刻楷木聖像，或舉以示之，矮鼓曰：「處處渾樸，處處神采，今人知神采之為神采，弗知渾樸之為神采也。」味其言，蓋通書畫者，然未嘗見其執管為之。矮鼓有聲光宣間，迄民國初元，侘際以死，賦性冷僻，故所作不多。余所見者，達摩一，高不盈尺，姿勢極生動，木之病在背，凸出不可刻，即因勢負箬笠焉。拐仙一，科頭偃臥，髪蓬蓬焉不知其幾千萬縷，足一屈一伸，筋骨畢露，所繫草屨亦精絕。是二者，見於父執劉仲儹家，仲儹蓋步溪之從子也。</p>
<h3>記剪影家黃憶年</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>在數閱月前，南京來了一位剪影家，用一張紙，就可以剪成一個側面的像，只需三四分鐘的功夫，居然可以剪得維妙維肖，這眞可以說是一種絕藝了！</p>
<p>這位剪影家姓黃，名叫憶年，是上海新華藝術專門學校的畢業生，曾在南昌行營電影科拍過「光明」的影片，對於木刻和雕刻，都有相當的硏究。後來由木刻和雕刻兩方面，想出這剪影的方法，竟得到不少的人的稱讚，於是他就來到南京，掛起剪影家的牌子。因為這種剪影，在從前還少見，所以都中人士前往剪影的，很是不少，他對於剪影的價格，是每人一元，並且還定了一個優待學生的辦法，就是凡是學生來剪的，一律减半收費，只要五角錢就可以剪一張了。據黃君說：這種剪影，並不貨事，不過要對雕刻和木刻有硏究的才行，因為剪成一個人影，並不是難事，但是要剪得妙肖，一點不錯，倒也不是容易的事呢！</p>
<p>我嘗說：中國的藝術，實在是値得讚佩，就拿剪花樣的女人來說吧，伊們能夠隨手隨意的剪成各種巧妙的花樣來，如果沒有藝術天才的人，似乎不能這樣剪得如意。剪花樣已經是不易了，剪人影當然是更不容易了！所以我說君的剪影半是硏究，半是天才。</p>
<h3>梵啞拉（中音拉琴）之話</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>我是不大被人注意的一個。我的名字叫做梵婭拉。我趕不上我的嬌小而年輕的妹妹梵啞鈴來得煊赫，也不及我的弟弟「契羅」—低音梵啞鈴—來得大和響亮。</p>
<p>為了我和「絃樂」中著名人物關係密切的緣故，我的個性失去了不少。我永遠是幫助別人的，和他們的音調混雜，對於我自己倒不大注意。</p>
<p>起初，我也是襯托高音的；過了許多年，梵啞鈴代替了我的位置。現在，我專奏中音或次中音。我的式樣和梵啞鈴差不多，但身材要比伊大五分之一。我的聲音比梵啞鈴低五分之一，我的絃索略粗，我的弓身略短略厚。但是，用指彈或用手拉，我也能夠做出我的多才的妹妹一般的音調來。批評我的人說，我是悲哀的，冷淡的，笨鈍的；但我却自信，我的高音是很柔和而且美麗的。</p>
<p>著名的作曲家　　　　　在他的交響曲「意大利的　洛爾特」Harold　in　haly中，把我當作重要的角色。華格納Wagntr屢次邀請我充角色。在能給人認識我的表情天才的樂隊中，我的地位逐漸重要起來了。</p>
<p>我希望我永遠願意充伴奏樂中的角色，和其他樂器在二聲樂和三聲樂中占一地位。我的被稱為「絃樂器中的哲學家」，就是因為我有着願意幫助人的謙遜的性情的緣故。</p>
<p>許多弄不好梵啞鈴的初學者，給予我成功的第二機會，因為在學習梵啞鈴以前，他們最好是從我學起。</p>
<h3>草書草說</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>草書之長，在論整幅，猶為文之成篇，不以一二字相瑕疵；其為難亦在於茲。其與文章最有同情未可或忽者，並以氣行；儘其中途多見紆廻曲折，而通體必求一貫，斯稱佳構。若丁走筆之際，情生勢變，妙趣自臻，匪可逆定。逆定無成，亦一般藝事之常道。不見乎醉中作草，往往愈益精神，夫吾又安能自知者哉。</p>
<p>吾國書法，眞草隸篆，各極其妙，而草書擅各體之長而集其大成，而錯綜變化之，乃遂純以美術條件行，並富曲綫之美。故草法悉與書法通和，其於瀟灑寫生之書法尤合。以草書之法作畫，必是傳神之繪；能以繪畫之法作草書，斯之謂草書也。世則有終身作畫而不識草書為何物者，斷無能識草書之妙而不識夫畫者，並無善為草書而莫解畫理者。蓋畫有着草法之一趣，而草書盡具畫法之衆長焉。</p>
<h3>跑不快</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>或謂擅草書者未必兼長眞書，抑亦可以無需，此謬言非解人所道也。草由行化，行自眞行，此吾國書法固定之步驟，理亦可測。或以草書之處地為我，則行吾父而眞吾祖也。孰謂吾能草而不能眞，詎非數典忘祖之妄人乎？昔人有言：「眞如立，行如行，草如走」誠能近以取譬。世有不能立而獨能走者罕也。惟眞書如立也主靜，草書如走也主動。喜動不喜解，是常人之恒情。故有以樂於作草，詭言不能眞書，自遯其所弗欲者。人亦遂從而為之辭云。使有人下來，果以草鳴而不能眞，則其草書之為野狐禪，終鮮是處。徒以盜名欺世必耳！是故「君子務本」，志於草書者可不念諸？</p>
<p>世界之大，人種紛歧，以色為辨，弱受強欺，習而相遠，其始則齊。「媽媽」（Mama）「伯伯」（Papa），發自孩提；語言所肇，無別華夷。粵稽文字，進化需期，結　記事，一綫是維。蟹行纏繞，成熟於西；吾國象形，烏跡獸蹄。人同此心，心同此理，推源其始，殆其然矣！文字遞變，而成今觀，吾華定之書，乃畫形之定象；考古之士，諒有同觀。則吾書法之獨粹美理，而秦西於茲無稱焉，以取徑之不同，自難求其深造，事理固然，灼灼顯矣！故書有鐘鼎石鼓之文，畫之圖案派也。書之歷篆隸，經漢魏，進於眞書，畫之有立體派也，印象派也，亦各存其面目　，煞費多人之探討而求近似焉。若書而為草，則益恣其錯綜，轉折，繚繞，發揮之變，極其用筆用墨之長，不亦畫而進於寫生之境也乎？以吾書秉圖畫之骨胎，而有草法以益明之，將見吾人終有圖畫之字傳示世界，以邀有識者之心領神會哉！</p>
<h3>墨痕竹葉</h3>
<p>— （黃山農）</p>
<p>黟縣萬山環抱，風景絕佳；距桃源洞五里許之處，產修竹特多，叢簊密篠，彌望皆是。普通之竹，其葉均着綠色，是處所產者，則呈黑色，宛如墨痕染成，雖久經雨淋日炙，其色均不减褪，斯為奇特。詢之鄕人，則有兩說：一為唐代李青蓮曾游此地，題詩石壁，將餘墨潑諸竹上而成，有類於湘妃斑竹故事。一說則為附近蘊藏煤礦頗富，係平日受其氣質薰染，致有此異。前說固屬一種神話，不可究詰：後說雖略具理由，然煤區產竹，所在多有，而其葉為黑色者，尚未前聞，亦一疑問也。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十三回　繞室發高談奮將起訴　傾壺聯舊好利可忘嫌</p>
<p>王實誠笑道：我們賣產業，只要人家給到了價錢，我們就可以賣出去，這倒並不認定什麽人，買多才拱拱手道：那就很好。我那紙條上寫得有地點時間，明日一早，我們當面談罷。王實誠道：不過旣要掉換買主，兄弟一個人不能作主，還得請我一位同族的先生出來共同負責。買多才道：那就請那位先生，同你一塊來好了。我雖不認得他，一面相識，第二回見面就是朋友了。請你對那位貴本家說，我歡迎他來談談的。王實誠道：紫先生有這樣好的意思，我一定把他拉了來。賈多才聽到他把名字末了一個字，當了姓喊將出來，本想去更正的，可是那王實誠怱怱忙忙的走開，要更正也來不及了。他心裏計畫着，假使這件買賣成功了，至少在大批欵項裏，可以撈起三千塊錢。有了地皮，也就可以把建築公司的工程，撈到手裏來辦，在這上面，又可以發一筆大財。眞是財運來了，門板也擋不住。早就想在未來的火車站旁邊找一塊地皮，想了什麽法子，也買不着一方地，不料事出偶然，竟有這樣的大地皮出賣，只幾句話，就把這件事拉到手了。心裏一高興起來，立刻把月英的事，扔到腦後面去，自由自在的躺到床上去。他雖是個愛睡早覺的人，到了西安，也就不能不跟着本地人，提前的起來。本地人是五點多鐘就起來的，賈多才到了七八點鐘，也只好起來了。每天上午在家裏，喝喝茶，吃點點心，到了十點以後，方才出門，可是到了今天，這就不同，和西安人一樣，五點多鐘就起來。看看隔壁屋子裏金先生的房門，是緊閉着，怱怱的洗過一把臉，喝了一杯茶，來不及等本地日報送來看，這就走出門去。心裏不免笑着，金子強還在夢中，他費盡了心機的一筆買賣，不知不覺，就由我搶奪過來了。他起來之後，見不着我，也就不會提防什麽的了。（三九九）</p>

<h3>客秈暫趨定局</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、勢趨定局、因連日市價飛漲後、長江與　台州均有裝到、而客帮興囤戶亦以市價太高、均取觀望態度、昨日客囤一致停頓、全市祇有廣東紅來一百包為厦門帮辦法去、其他客帮概地问津、但日内市價若能壓小若干、客囤即有時胃、目下則因處於擯局、暫時雖望有鉅大升降也、本街實銷尚有應酬、昨去　米四千包、還　元米一百包、行情均與前市相似云、</p>

<h3>油市　结帳前後之柏油市</h3>
<p>拍油上年因浙省年令大　、故本埠科季所銷、盡是浙油、且漢油出　較邊、荊州枝江等汕抵漢已在冬至後、到滬應銷已經不及、所以初新之際、本埠行淘全賴浙油供給、不獨滬上一埠、即蘇踢常等處、無不仰給於浙也、惟滬行案以漢油為主體、若易浙油、則內地各鄕鎭均趨　浙省、致行家擋鉜之地點縮小、範　僅及本埠而已、且近年來燭淘銷塲日减、所賴以抵補者、厥惟皂廠數亦不多、而專營皂用柏油者另有其人、行家反致落後、故柏油一業實無發展可言、其營業範圍較大者、應推和達記寅大兩家、尚能保持向有之範圍、每年獲利數台金而極、餘均範圍較小、然尚有白　油精等副業、故亦能獲利、但共祇七八家、營業穩健、所以址數年來絕少變遷、自總結帳後、開盤市面尚平穩、聞近日漢市有洋行交易、計銷去麻城二千件光景、合市秤在每担十六元左右、較去季收盤加起四角、將來開盤恐亦須十六元也、重荊漢市收盤為十作六角、開盤亦必稍加、本市春盤前日議　、重荊每担二十一元二角、雜重二十一元、麻城市秤每担十八元八角、惟今春頭盤銷塲、遠遜往年、致行家春盤進貨、均束手觀望、漢市雖異常堅固、然浙油人心較弱、致造成北强南疲之形勞也、</p>
<h3>糖市　海南赤號盤跌半元</h3>

<h3>南北貨　金針菜有受挫勢</h3>
<p>金針菜因連日步漲過　、實銷觀望、未肯多進、且銷胃最廣之粵港帮、因　處市面不能過高、吃胃不盛、行方念於脫手、後市勢必受挫、不免大漲小向耳、</p>
<h3>五金　白鉛皮市價下跌</h3>
<p>白鉛皮海外定價、已由十八鎊十五先令、回漲至二十鎊五先令、本埠市固理應趨緊、無奈環境惡劣、近日趨勢、適得其反、蓋到貨多而出路微、人心萎而市氣衰、故售盤迭見下跌、該市二號每擔三十元、三號三十元五角、四號五號均估三十二元、六號以至十號、祇開二十九元五角、比之先前、均各小去五角至二元不等、聞大批及現欵交易、其行情尚可低廉云、</p>
<h3>黑鐵皮昨有新貨抵滬</h3>
<p>軋缺多日之黃　牌黑鐵皮、其新貨昨日由美國裝來三千餘扎、卸大來碼頭、故需用此貨之搪磁廠。兵工廠等、聞昨均有現貨拋去、其價厚花色每担售十二元五角、薄花色估十三元七角半、查开出數共有六七百扎之多、依最近外國定價觀之、此貨行情、恐一時不易回　也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　呢絨本街首先交易</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>雜感</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>前日日使館一等參贊兼駐京總領事須磨彌吉郞，啣命返滬，擬入京　見張外長，對於中日關係有所轉陳，須磨過滬時，對日記者談，此次回國，歷　廣田外相軍部當局及一般朝野要人，對中日問題，有一番認識，有以中日前途為憂，甚至對中日會議發生疑問者，大可不必云。</p>
<p>語云「皇帝不急急煞太監」，「綿羊不急急煞老虎」，眞是笑天下之大話，日本是侵略的國家；我國是被侵略的國家，我國人應該担憂而不憂，日人不應該担憂而憂，所謂憂人所不常憂，而不憂人所當憂，寄語日人，儘管放一百二十個心，任意去幹，不必担心。</p>
<p>前日某報載，德王已在察省宣佈「自治政府」成立，政府設張北，謂為元朝之繼續，自治政府之旗幟，為紅黃藍白四色，最近德王曾乘去夏日方所贈之飛機，飛往滿洲國之新京數决，據聞曾與溥儀成立協定，由滿洲國供給蒙古新政府之軍火云云。</p>
<p>後接中央電訊云，德王曾有電來，更正此事，我對於外國報紙及通訊社，本來不大信任，因為牠們專喜歡造謠之故，所以我讀古人書，有盡信書則不如無書，不免感慨係之。</p>
<p>中外矚目的胡漢民氏，業已回國，不久將入京主持中常會事，他近在港發表談話有，「簡言之，黨應恢復為有主義有精神之黨，力除過去滅裂渙散之錯誤，期賡續本黨未竟之偉業，政府應改造為有責任有能力之政府，力矯過去畏葸苟安之錯誤，以負荷解除國難，建設國家之重任」云云。</p>
<p>這幾句談話，眞是很有價値，不過近來要人，有一個普通毛病，臺下的話和臺上的事實往注不符，在野的時期，說得十分動聽，但是一到了臺上，便無聲無嗅？不能貫澈其在野時的主張，我此刻只有希望胡漢民氏，上臺之後，能將現在的話，一一兌現。</p>
<p>日本新任駐華大使有田八郞，近向新聞界發表談話，謂中國外交，素採以夷制夷，遠交近攻主義，故日本當自動使歐美各國諒解日本之對華地位，採發揮實力，外閒內急方策為要云云。</p>
<p>所謂外閒內急方策，卽廣田外相的水鴨外交，外表態度似極安靜，而暗裏急激進行，他們的方策，始終一貫，努力進攻，而我們政府的方策如何，有什麽的良好方策去應付，我們實不得而知，不過有一點，不要被日方所欺弄，他們暗地裏做功夫，我們應明目張膽做功夫，情願吃明白虧不情願吃暗地裏虧。</p>
<h3>鞭炮</h3>
<p>— 東野太郞</p>
<p>丁家街南頭是一片廣塲。枯黃的碎草平舖在土面，點綴上飛散開的鞭砲皮，好像有點春意了。一棵電綫桿直立在廣塲上，招呼着吹過的風。</p>
<p>一羣孩子在草地上際際嚓嚓地吵嚷着，好像新年把他們底心引得燃燒起來了。</p>
<p>小九剛呌他媽打了一頓，氣憤憤地跑出來，看到一羣人底歡樂，用手抹一不鼻涕，擠進人堆里：</p>
<p>——小金子，過來！</p>
<p>小金子和他差不多的歲數：都是八九歲，不，一過年得說十來歲了。臉上塗滿了灰塵，兩隻眼大大地睜着，眉毛挑皮地動着。他回過頭來，看到小九子，看到小九子底鼻涕，把手往腮上一擦</p>
<p>——不要臉，淌鼻涕！</p>
<p>小九「哼」地吸了一下。問他誰在這里放鞭炮，眼睛還在人縫里巡逡着找。</p>
<p>——過來，我說給你，——小九過來了——你有錢沒有，買鞭放？</p>
<p>小九把眼睛翻了翻，頭搖了搖，伏在小金子耳朶上說了一套兩個人能够聽到的話。小金子笑了，鞭炮歡樂地響着，好像故意向他示威似的，他沉思一會說：</p>
<p>——要是不成呢？他一定不願意，……屬狗×的：許進不許出！</p>
<p>兩個人重新擠進人羣里來的時候，兩個人底眼睛都注意着站在常中的金少爺。他個子本來不大高，加上有點胖，比起來，又矮父笨。張着兩隻小眼睛，手里提着隻鞋盒子，鞋盒子里面全是値錢的鞭炮，他手里拿着一大把香，全沒點着。他拿出一把鞭炮，點着一支香交給他底好伙計福生，呌他放，他聽。福生也是笨手笨脚地，又害怕又不能不放地去點炮，常常以為點着了，嚇得跑開來。金少爺就把手從耳朶上拿下來，憨笑地說；</p>
<p>——小膽，不敢放！</p>
<p>小金子看是個機會，挨過去說：</p>
<p>——喂，咱哥們誰給誰，我替你放說着向福生底肩上拍了一下。福生有些吃驚地望着他底臉，又威覺到羞辱似地，不理他，各自點自己底鞭，誰知一下打着小九底腿，小九進一步，走過來，把眼一橫，兩隻手往腰里一擱，同時給小金子施了個眼色，用腿向福生身上一頂：</p>
<p>——這些老爺們得罪你來嗎？打這些人！</p>
<p>福生更加膽去地綿羊似地向小九望着，不敢動，又不敢示弱地望望金少爺，金少爺正傻而瓜吉地等着，看到他望他，壯壯膽說：</p>
<p>——他這麽不講理，明明是欺侮人，你好好地聽就是啦，幹麽又找事生秧地？</p>
<p>——眞是，俺放俺底鞭，你聽你底，你找事……</p>
<p>這些人們多好，不化錢倒僱來一個放鞭的，還有人送鞭放！</p>
<p>旁觀的人也想看熱鬧，有的幸災樂禍地打哈哈，有的說冷話，好像大家都給春天包圍住了。小九吸了一下鼻涕，縱縱鼻頭，哼了聲：</p>
<p>誰欺侮你，打狗還得看主人，你是誰？少說閑話，哥們，拿點咱放放……</p>
<p>——憑什麽……</p>
<p>小金子跟小九底拳頭同時伸過來：憑這個。同時，就向金少爺跟前走去，金少爺望望那兩隻黑得討厭的拳頭，生怕一下落在自己身上，染汚了自己底袍子，　脚就跑。可是，往哪里跑呢？四周都是人！他一下子就被小金子抓住了呵，他圍繞住那棵電綫桿跑，小金子就在後面追，小九將福生纏着了，不能過來帮忙，金少爺吃力地跑，喊着：「福生，喊家里人去」，臉紅糊糊地想流汗，身上給火燒住，脚底下一滑也不知道是一擋，「扑　！」一隻麵布袋似的摔在草地上了。嘴羊似的啃着草。一大盒子紅的綠的花的鞭炮凌亂地撒滿了一地。小金子不管金少爺底事，伸開衣襟？一把一把地向裏裝：</p>
<p>——小九，別管他，快來拾！……媽那×，你搶啥！</p>
<p>一面和別的孩子們搶奪着，一面喊小九。地上沒有剩餘的了，向頭看金少爺還沒起來，伏在地上，臉上流着汗珠。他過去坐在他身上說。</p>
<p>——不為好人，剛纔給了不就沒事了嗎？可是，我問你：你怕不怕我？說！怕了？怕幾輩？……不成！……頂少一百輩！還有，你媽呌誰×，說，說是「小金子×」！</p>
<p>四周哈哈地笑了，歡呼着。小九把福生反背着手跪在地上，一隻脚往背上一踢，嘴「啪」地聲，福生死屍似地倒下去，回過頭來。</p>
<p>小金子，走呵，放鞭炮去呵！</p>
<p>他們剛剛離開草塲，就聽到金家底家人吵着：</p>
<p>——那個王八羔子惹少爺啦……</p>
<p>——媽那個×！這些人！……走小九，放去！</p>
<p>小金子把胳膊放在小九底　子上，親熱地走開去。</p>
<h3>暗殺案（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 葉萊</p>
<p>「這撈什子，我也眞不想再幹下去了，實在只有出賬，沒有進賬，可是，你打算怎麽去淸理數目呢？這消息是不能够傳出去的，一傳出去，全部的債項也成了問題，很麻煩！」</p>
<p>「現在也沒有什麽存欵了。」黃家興說着，又想了一想：「我們這里只還有一萬多，你過去又虧光了三萬多，怎麽辦？就把公司里的全部一萬多分攤，但你要把你個人所虧空的三萬多算淸楚」？</p>
<p>阿均好像给一桶冷水淋下來似的，他的心里給家與的話打着結子，兜着圈子。一會兒，心中的火燄燒到那灰色的疲乏的眼珠子上來了。他想了一下，他覺得家興的手里那條五萬多的現欵不拿出來攤分，就好像受到家興的侮辱和欺騙似的，咬着牙根氣憤憤地瞅着那還在好笑着的家興。</p>
<p>可是，黃家興好像不感到阿均是恨他，而且突然變了仇敵似的。他還笑道：</p>
<p>「老均，我們一倒閉，不是馬上淸理嗎，淸理以後，再行分派，在我這里的兩三萬，早就和你一樣虧空了。你不相信嗎？去問一問周筠吧！他是知道的。」</p>
<p>家與還在笑着，而且機警地瞪着他，他就像一隻受了槍彈打傷了的瘋狂了的獅子似的吼了起來：</p>
<p>「什麽鬼話呀，存在你手里的還有五萬多，至於我，也是為了公司虧空的，你這樣做不公平的，你這狡滑的：」</p>
<p>家興給阿均的吼呌怔着的，腦袋里儘是一幕一幕的賬目了，他沉着腦袋，他不能不地也變得憤怒而聽了起來：</p>
<p>「那不能，總之，你先把你的虧空的欽拿回來再說吧。」</p>
<p>這樣，兩個人都變了沉默的憤怒地顫抖着的獅子似的分散了。</p>
<p>幾天以後，城里接着阿均和家興火拚的傳說而關了門的公司。而全城就湧洶地起了巨浪，許多有關的商店也倒閉了。</p>
<p>可是，就在這個時期里，一個黑夜里，家興從一個烟館里回家的時候，給幾個黑影閃了一閃的把他的性命完結了。</p>

<h3>花燈</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>四五年來，心境顯然在速度中改變了，趣味和意興，老是被一種沉重的憂鬱牢牢壓住，在別人或許認為値得歡欣的事，而在我，祇是感覺着淡然。於是，朋友們都斥我太悲觀，而更判定我這樣活下去，永遠得不到人生的眞趣。我承認這判定是對的，也曾屢次起着動機—我狂歡一下吧，儘量享受一下我從前所心愛的東西吧，甚至再撩起童年時代的天眞—然而，每决總失敗了。</p>
<p>目前，又是耍花燈的佳節，要是我猶在童年的話，不知要鬧到怎般地步？這些事回憶起來，簡直仍鮮艷活躍的如在目前；當我九十歲的時候，每逢這新春燈節，總不肯放鬆我爸的，一放飯碗便抹抹嘴拖爸上城隍廟買花燈，那時爸頭髮還沒變白，手脚輕健，我牽着他天靑色鐵機緞的袍角，那麽一跳一蹤的跟爸走着城裏的石子街，走一程，我總偷望一回爸的臉色，他老是那樣微笑着，春陽撲在他臉上，益顯出他的容光與心坎的喜悅，他有時伸手撫摸我臉龐，他的手是溫暖的，溫暖的呵。</p>
<p>從天眞無邪的小心地中，亦會滲出感謝之意了。「世界上，除掉媽，還有誰比爸更可親可愛呢？我一生一世要緊靠着媽和爸的，我情願不吃飯，也不讓爸和媽離開我，別人給我買花燈，我也不要……」那時不是這樣想着的嗎，雖愚蠢得可笑，却出於至情。如今想來。心坎不免蒙上一層灰黯的悽凉之霧，而眼眶潤濕了。　偶然經過城隍廟，燈市的盛况，雖在這遭難的年頭，依舊不减當年，花燈的式樣與製紮，因於物質文明的進化，越來越精巧美觀了。可是，這都與我不能再發生什麽關係。短促的童年如水箭一般溜過，又有誰能把它繫住呢？生活環境正往低落的方面滑去，連抓住一些安閒透氣的時間都不容易呵。</p>
<p>從此，我祇有瞪眼望着鄰家孩子手中花燈的光明了。</p>
<p>當我第一年混入生活的洪流中，我的爸和媽就搬到鄉下去住了，一則為着减輕我生活的担荷，二則亦是葉落歸根的辦法，老年的人總有老年人的算計，天下的父母總沒有不疼愛顧慮他們的兒子的。童年時的不肯離開爸和媽，甚至情願不吃飯，而現在我正因為着要吃飯，不得不離開兩個老年人。呵呵，我幾時還能牽着爸的袍角上城隍廟買花燈呢？我幾時還能享受到爸的手掌的溫暖呢？我的心境永遠不會恢復了。</p>
<p>在這花燈的節令中，我祇有旁觀的份兒了。</p>

<h3>日本千葉醬油事業參觀記（四）</h3>
<p>— （葉西園）</p>
<p>野田醬油株式會社以出產「龜甲萬」醬油聞名日本，此外，還出產「萬上」味淋。野田的醬油與流山的味淋，博得日本極高的好評。它的成立是合併了野田八家的醬油釀造業者及流山味淋，與仁川的日本醬油，規模之大，在日本自當首屈一指。茲略記其數字如下：</p>
<p>資本金　三千萬圓</p>
<p>敷地總坪數　十六萬九千八百九十九坪</p>
<p>建物總坪數　七萬八百二十四坪</p>
<p>從業職員　四百人</p>
<p>從業職工　三千人</p>
<p>年造石數　五十萬石</p>
<p>工塲　二十三所</p>
<p>它的工塲所在地自然大部是在千葉的野田；此外還散處在千葉的梅鄕村，行德町，以及流山町。在關西兵庫縣加古郡荒井村還有它的關西工塲，朝鮮仁川府松林里有朝鮮工塲，滿洲奉天宇治町有它的奉天工塲。其規模之大，是可以想見了。為了職工的利益，野田醬油株式會社還提出了六十萬元興辦了一所「與風會」，作為從業職工的會館。</p>

<h3>彈詞</h3>
<p>徐文璧開篇</p>
<p>市音（一三四〇）上午十時至十一時</p>
<p>開篇「楊妃恨」</p>
<p>寂寂西宮畫恨長。溫泉浴罷更添香。貴妃獨坐沉香榻。聽那喃喃詩育雪衣娘。想他是，一朝入侍承恩後。萬歲龍顏喜欲狂。想當初，雙星月下私盟誓。鈿盒金釵永不忘。願生同雜賬死同穴。花想容顏雲想裳。猶記得，喁喁情話長生殿。清平一關譜宮商。那其間，六宮粉黛無顏色。把龐幸的梅妃撇半旁。可恨咱家高力士。說道，今宵萬歲欠安康。故而是，絮閣留戀不許他人到。請娘娘悄悄莫驚惶。楊娘娘性多疑忌。銅環輕叩洩春光。只道是，御榻森嚴宮禁地。却不道，梅娘娘侍奉伴君王。誰知曉，漁陽　鼓連天氣。祿山兵變擾范陽。哥舒翰兵敗先鋒賊。潼關已破竟慌張。頓時驚破霓裳曲。駕幸西蜀冒風霜。事想倉卒無可奈。命陳元禮統領六軍行。行到馬嵬山下路。六軍不發太猖狂。說道，可憐，蒙塵天子渾無主。玉殞香消心倍傷。到後來，劍閣聞鈴腸欲斷。雨淋淋一曲更凄暗凉。此恨綿綿何日忘。</p>
<p>程方舟李蓮蓀毛家書華美（一〇六〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「望病」</p>
<p>月色微微淡淡風。樵樓更鼓響叮咚。美姑娘手把燈台點。走進怨家書館中。輕輕移步到着床前立。摘起維帳，低聲啟口叫表兄。將身坐。手摸胸。佳人重行，啟口話情衷。那日，聞得君家身有恙。小妹煩併發症不寬鬆。奴是，意欲親身來伏侍。只為你娘親家法兇。則落得，今夜乘娘先去睡。奴奴前來問問兄。要問你，此病為了因何起。莫不為，色慾之中用了工。才郎聽。咲春風。表妹之言理欠通，我有病。卻不重。只為得，夜來乘涼冒了風。不日諒必就可愈。故而不去請郎中。小妹聽。心就鬆。愁客頃刻改咲歡容。哥哥吓，奴有好心把郎中請。報你一旦病就鬆送。好待那，佳期覆雨與翻雲。</p>
<p>陸秋霞雙珠鳳</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「珍珠塔　亭會」</p>
<p>留賓主僕急匆匆。陳蓮是，老眼頻揩喜氣邊。雖見他，襤褸衣衫羞落魄。然而，丰神秀逸晋人風。端的是，玉堂人物非凡品。相近天顏指日中。交臂尚嫌相見晚。把那，進身次第話喁喁。說到，受恩深處淚雙溶。那曉，岳家薄鏢遭冤枉。我是，阻隔水重山又重。可憐，寸心兒日開封。方欣姑姪重逢日。那裏有，骨肉形如陌路同。但是，女流見識要有寬宏。方生局促忙歉遜。姑爹呀，冒犯尊嚴不恭。自幼椿庭嗟失蔭。一個兒，白雲瞻望思親切。一個兒，坤柳蕭蒼頭隱語反關切。心有靈犀一點通。眼前半子作乘龍。</p>

<p>小魯：大哥在叫我們吃飯了，走吧，快點把鋤頭摃起來。</p>
<p>阿巧：作活兒作得挺高興的又叫我們吃飯了。</p>
<p>小魯：怎麼？阿巧，你肚子裏不餓嗎？</p>
<p>阿巧：那除非你小魯的肚子是特別的，所以才不要吃東西呢，我的肚子可不成！</p>
<p>小魯：阿巧，你老是小孩兒似的，說話總是這樣顛三倒四的，人家叫伊吃飯麼，你不高興去，問你肚子餓不餓麼你又說得吃東西！這什麼意思了？</p>
<p>阿巧：（嬌笑）得了，你瞧，你叫我槓起鋤頭來，可是你不槓幹麼呀？</p>
<p>小魯算了，兩把都讓我來摃吧！（邊跳著邊叫哭著）伊老是這樣淘氣～</p>
<p>老五（山東口音）小魯，你們老是這麼快活，我一看見了就想起我自己來了。</p>
<p>阿巧（嬌笑）雙小子！（跳著跑了）</p>
<p>小魯：老五，回頭看見了。</p>
<p>老五：別走，別走，我跟你說兩句話，你們的田租收過了沒有？</p>
<p>小魯：他們來收過了，可是，這幾年種莊稼的多賠本，那兒來的錢給呢？</p>

<p>Nanjing. The original text of Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi's proposal to the Executive Yuan on the 4th to amend the Central Bank Law is as follows: In the announcement issued by this ministry on November 4th of last year, it was stated that the organization of the Central Bank would also be improved to fulfill the duties of a bank for banks. In order to demonstrate impartiality and strengthen public confidence, this ministry has revised Article 7 of the current Central Bank Law, which originally stipulated 40% for commercial shares, to 60%, and requested public decision and amendment. However, since the implementation of the legal tender, the entire banking organization should be adjusted urgently, and the Central Bank, as the hub of national finance, should stand in a detached position to fulfill the duties of a bank for banks. To achieve this goal, capital revision is only one aspect, and how should the Central Bank's business be divided so that it can develop in different directions, connect the arteries, and achieve financial stability and market vitality? As for the regulations on legal tender reserves and the restrictions on cash reserves falling below the legal limit, they are even more important for stabilizing the currency and strengthening the credit of the legal tender. Xiangxi has carefully studied and considered these matters, adopting new systems and considering national conditions, and has revised and supplemented various banking laws and regulations, as well as the newly established Real Estate Bank Regulations, which are proposed in separate cases. Now, the draft amendment to the Central Bank Law, totaling 57 articles, is specially submitted for approval so that it can be resolved and implemented according to legislative procedures. Is this appropriate? We respectfully await your public decision. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Finance Decision-Maker Xu Kan discussed the issuance of the Unified Reconstruction Public Bonds. Before the plan was drafted, leaders of industry and commerce and domestic economic experts had various opinions and contributed them to Minister Kong. Therefore, the plan drafted this time is a collection of various opinions, considering the government's standard for consolidating financial policies. After the draft was completed, opinions were solicited from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Guild, local cooperative associations, the Public Debt Fund Management Committee, and financial leaders, who all agreed that the established methods were appropriate. The purpose is to balance income and consolidate the financial foundation. Now that it has been passed by the Executive Yuan, it will take three months for the new banknotes to be printed. As for the opinions of experts Chen Changheng and Wei Tingsheng on stopping public bonds from being used as futures, they are very insightful, but there are also advantages and disadvantages. Because our country is vast, and remote provinces such as Yunnan cannot arrive in Shanghai on the same day, futures can still be done as before. The current public bond fund of over 11 million per month will increase month by month in the future. Future rises and falls in public bonds will have certificates to balance them. After the commercial shares of the Central Reserve Bank increase, a shareholders' meeting will be established. Domestic and foreign exchange transactions will be handled by the Bank of China. After the new subsidiary currency is minted, it will be handed over to the Central, China, and Communications Banks in various places on February 15 to circulate to their branches. The sorting out of the old subsidiary currency will be gradually recovered and reminted by the government. Rumors that the United States will purchase another 300 million ounces of silver from our country are not accurate. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has been ordered to stop auctions and investigate speculation trends. It is said that personnel from the Ministry of Finance participated in it, and investigators have been dispatched to investigate the brokers' accounts in the exchange, whether they were done by banks or by private individuals. If private individuals are public officials, they will be severely punished if they are found to be speculating. Once the investigation is completed, it can be reopened. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Key points of Finance Minister Kong's request to amend the Central Bank Law are as follows: The Central Bank is the reserve bank for all banks in the country, responsible for adjusting finance and stabilizing currency. It is organized as a limited liability company.  The total capital is set at 100 million national currency, with each share worth 100 yuan, for a total of 1 million shares. If necessary, an increase in shares may be submitted to the National Government for approval. Shares are divided into four categories: A, B, C, and D. Category A consists of 400,000 shares, which will be subscribed by the National Government. Category B consists of 50,000 shares, which will be subscribed by the provincial and municipal governments. Category C consists of 350,000 shares, which will be subscribed by domestic legal entities engaged in banking. Category D consists of 200,000 shares, which will be subscribed by the domestic people. The government shall sell the three categories of shares, B, C, and D, as stipulated in the preceding paragraph, at a reasonable price within three months from the date of promulgation of this law. After the share capital is fully paid up, a shareholders' meeting will be convened.  The Central Bank is granted the following privileges by the government: Issuing legal tender and customs gold unit notes, managing the issuance of standard currency and subsidiary currency minted by the National Government.  Managing the national treasury and underwriting domestic and foreign debts, and managing matters related to principal and interest payments.  The Central Bank shall establish a board of directors, composed of 17 directors, of which 9 are specially appointed by the National Government, and 8 are elected by the shareholders' meeting from shares of 100 or more.  The Central Bank shall establish a supervisory board, composed of 9 supervisors, of which 4 are specially appointed by the National Government, and the remaining 5 are elected by the shareholders' meeting from shareholders with 100 or more shares.  The business is largely the same as the current law, but it only accepts deposits at low interest rates and only handles domestic and foreign exchange for government agencies. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan on the 4th regarding the issuance of the Unified Reconstruction Public Bonds. The original text is as follows: The legal tender policy promulgated in November of last year was originally intended for self-reliance and economic revival. Since its implementation, finance has become increasingly stable and society has gradually become more active. The Jianghai Customs turned into a surplus in December, which has not happened in the 60 years since the establishment of the customs. All these facts prove that the legal tender policy is the key to national salvation and survival at this time. Xiangxi is responsible for actively striving to improve the banking system, strengthen financial organization, support production and construction, and balance national treasury revenue and expenditure, in accordance with the declaration of November 4th of last year, in order to complete the entire policy as soon as possible and achieve economic revival, benefiting the country and the people. People in society, with their patriotic enthusiasm, have expressed various expectations. For example, Shanghai business leaders Yu Hede, Rong Zongjing, Liu Hongsheng, and Guo Shun jointly petitioned, and chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities sent telegrams urging the reduction of deposit and loan interest rates and the lowering of bond monthly interest rates to revive industry and commerce and revitalize all industries. Economic scholars such as Gu Jigaodeng published papers advocating the conversion of existing public debt treasury bills into public bonds with low interest rates and long terms. Financial leaders also believe that the government's domestic bonds have high interest rates and short terms, and the amount of principal and interest paid monthly is too large, and customs duties are insufficient to bear the burden. They should be extended and reduced appropriately to consolidate debt credibility and take into account construction projects. They have listed various methods and requested implementation. Xiangxi listened to all parties' opinions and believed that the government's policy is based on the welfare of the entire people. Although the shortfall in customs duties is a temporary fact, balancing revenue and expenditure is a permanent plan. In recent years, in the midst of extreme financial difficulties, we have tried our best to support and subsidize the fund, and have worked hard to consolidate debt credibility. All kinds of painstaking measures should be carried out consistently from beginning to end. While carefully studying and drafting a comprehensive plan, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and others mistakenly heard rumors and did not understand the truth. They sent a telegram requesting prudence. After a clear reply, they have been able to understand. On the first day of this month, a meeting was convened with bondholders, local cooperative associations, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Guild, and financial leaders to discuss and decide on six methods. According to the declaration of the bondholders' meeting (omitted because it was reported earlier), Xiangxi carefully reviewed the various old domestic public debt treasury bills, etc., which have numerous names and odd numbers. It is indeed a fact that exchanging them for unified public bonds is a stable and sound method. The annual interest rate of 6% remains unchanged, and the bondholders' existing interests are not harmed. The customs revenue will be sufficient to allocate the principal and interest fund for a long time in the future, and there will be no shortage, which will further consolidate the credibility of the national debt for a long time. That is, the bondholders will be able to enjoy fixed benefits for a long time. Another reconstruction public bond will be issued so that the government can complete the entire economic revival policy as soon as possible, and the country and society will benefit immensely. Now, based on the above-mentioned agreed methods, a draft of the 25th Year Unified Public Bond Regulations, five types of redemption and interest payment schedules, and a principle of issuance, and a draft of the 25th Year Reconstruction Public Bond Regulations, a redemption and interest payment schedule, and a principle of issuance are proposed for public decision. The principal and interest due on February 29th and March 1st of this year for the 6% public bond, the 7% public bond, and the 20-year disaster relief bond, which have already been announced, should still be paid as before. A combined statement is made. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Key Points of Chairman Chiang's Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>The Responsibility of Today's Youth</p>
<p>Nanjing. Chairman Chiang gave a broadcast speech at 8:30 PM on the 4th, titled "The Responsibility of Today's Youth." The key points are as follows: At this time of serious national crisis, there is no way to save the country and restore it except for the entire nation to unify its will and concentrate its strength.  Young students are the backbone of the nation and the teachers of the people, and have the responsibility to lead the people to jointly save the country and restore it. They must first strive to improve the four educations of "wisdom," "virtue," "physical fitness," and "group," to strengthen themselves. They must first practice the New Life Movement and cultivate the basic virtues of "understanding righteousness, knowing shame, taking responsibility, and abiding by discipline."  The rise and fall of modern countries depends on the strength of the national organization. The youth of the whole country should use the spirit of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" to lead the people to exert the power of organization. Those who use youth to disrupt order, destroy discipline, sacrifice youth's studies, and harm the life of the country are traitors.  It is hoped that the youth of the whole country will work hard to strengthen themselves, fulfill their responsibilities, and build a glorious and splendid Republic of China.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Change of Chinese and Japanese Envoys</h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>Since our country's administrative center renewed the Ambassador to Japan, Chiang, returning to take on the important task of internal affairs, the heavy responsibility of sending an envoy to Japan has fallen on Xu Shiying, who has long been engaged in charity and relief work. Coincidentally, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Arita, was also recalled because the results of his activities in China were not satisfactory to his military, and Arita Hachiro, who had once advocated a "tough-on-China theory," was transferred from Belgium to take his place. Based on factual observations, this change of envoys in the two countries is due to ordinary administrative relations in our country, while in Japan it is a reason to change diplomatic actions. Since the internal situations are not the same, the points that deserve attention are inevitably of different importance.</p>
<p>Ambassador Akira Ariyoshi came to our country in September of the 21st year and has been in office for more than three years. When he first arrived, he adopted a policy of observing the situation quietly and taking advantage of opportunities to advance. In October of that year, it was reported that Ariyoshi had suggested to Foreign Minister Hirota to change his policy toward China and oppose the invasion of Jehol, and at the same time, it was reported that Japan would change its envoy to China and replace him with Arita. If the people of the country can still remember the old news from three years ago, then observing the current situation will allow them to have a considerable understanding of Japan's future after the change of envoys. The reporter states this not to use the issue of the people of the Japanese mission as the basis for the discussion of Sino-Japanese relations. In the past five years, Japan's actions against us have been entirely directed by its Sanzhai Saka military headquarters and the Kwantung Army authorities in Changchun. The Kaskigase chief brain cannot have independent opinions, let alone the envoys who are ordered to do things. When it is suitable for quiet observation, employ quiet observers; when it is suitable for advance, employ tough figures. The appraisal is fixed to change with the environment, but as for its relationship with our country and the consequences, it depends only on how our diplomatic authorities deal with it.</p>
<p>Since the rumor of the Sino-Japanese Nanjing Conference has spread for more than a month, if it can really be realized, then China's pursuit of international coexistence with the most patient attitude is no less than the last test. Under such a situation, China is still trying to mediate the relations between the two countries, not willing to be infinitely humiliated. If the situation in the future reaches a degree that China cannot tolerate or force, China cannot but seek another way to survive. The reporter believes that if the Nanjing Conference does not become a bubble, Ambassador Arita's coming to China will be responsible for the negotiation. Will it create a situation that China must find another way to survive, or will it change the will of the aggressors in its country with independent diplomatic opinions? The Chinese are paying attention to this new envoy in the neighboring country.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter also expresses considerable expectations for Xu Shiying, who has shouldered the heavy responsibility of sending an envoy to Japan. Xu has been in charge of the judiciary for more than ten years in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. After the second year of the Republic, he entered politics and was still able to cope with ease. He has also presided over relief work for many years and has a reputation in society. Now he has assumed the diplomatic responsibility with generosity. Although he is not a master of diplomacy, he must be confident in fulfilling his mission. Under the current situation of the two countries, even if the foreign mission does not have the power to preside over the country's fortune, it often makes the already lost sovereignty slightly recovered, and the future situation does not become worse. Can Xu meet the expectations of the people of the country?</p>
<h3>The Rise and Fall of Italian and German Power: France Consolidates its Position in Central Europe</h3>
<p>Negotiating Military Matters with Romania</p>
<p>Seeking Understanding with Yugoslavia as well</p>
<p>London – As Germany grows stronger and Italy is temporarily unable to operate on the European stage, France, recognizing this situation, is eager to consolidate its alliances in Central and Eastern Europe. Therefore, the talks with monarchs and high officials of various countries who passed through Paris on their way back home after attending the funeral rites of King George are noteworthy. These meetings seem to have two purposes: 1. To dispel any possible misunderstandings arising from the current situation. 2. To solidify the commitment of those who safeguard peace to adhere to the collective security system. According to French political commentators, some countries, including Romania and Yugoslavia, have recently shown a tendency towards Germany. Paris is concerned about this and is now taking the opportunity to dispel these concerns. Romania has already reached an understanding with France, and today's talks between French Foreign Minister Flandin and Prince Paul of Yugoslavia are expected to produce similar assurances. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris – Six diplomats, politicians, and administrative leaders, led by French Foreign Minister Flandin and King Carol of Romania, held important talks today to restore the Danubian Pact negotiations and to consolidate the continental system of security. It is also noted that Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov is visiting here to urge the French Chamber of Deputies to ratify the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact within this week. What is noteworthy is that the stipulations of this united front are disliked by Germany. Today, it was learned that these diplomatic negotiations may lead to a mutual assistance pact between the Soviet Union and Romania. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris – Diplomatic talks here are constantly changing, making them almost impossible to grasp. Therefore, in addition to what is published in the newspapers, there are also behind-the-scenes discussions. King Carol of Romania and the country’s Air Force Minister have consulted with the French Chief of Staff for a long time. It is reported that the King of Bulgaria expressed to the French Foreign Minister that his country will be loyal to the League of Nations. French newspapers consider the talks between Flandin and the Turkish Foreign Minister to be quite important because such talks not only concern the Italian-Abyssinian dispute and the Central European collective security system, but also involve the future distribution of the Balkan countries. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>It was recently heard in the Romanian capital that the Prime Minister and Minister of the Army, Tatarescu, will depart for Paris to negotiate military equipment issues after King Carol returns home. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>French and Turkish Foreign Ministers Discuss Balkan Issues</h3>
<p>Bulgaria is Willing to Support the League of Nations</p>
<p>Paris – It is reported that Flandin met with Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü this morning to discuss: 1. Mutual assistance in the Mediterranean. 2. Bulgaria's accession to the Balkan Entente. As for whether the redeployment of fortifications in Turkey's Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits was discussed, it is still unknown. Regarding this matter, it is generally believed that Turkey thinks it is inappropriate to raise the issue of the straits at this time because Germany may soon demand to redeploy fortifications on the left bank of the Rhine. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris – King Carol of Romania recently gave an interview to a reporter from "Le Petit Parisien," saying that the issue of concluding the Danubian Pact has made great progress since the authorities of various countries held talks in London and Paris recently. As for maintaining Austria's independence, although previous efforts have failed, he remains optimistic. The newspaper also reported that King Boris of Bulgaria told French Foreign Minister Flandin during their meeting yesterday that Bulgaria is determined to make the League of Nations Covenant its ultimate destination and is prepared to cooperate effectively with the League of Nations. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris – King Boris of Bulgaria recently visited President Lebrun at the Presidential Palace and inspected a detachment of the public guard. The talks lasted for an hour. After leaving the palace, he received Premier Sarraut, Foreign Minister Flandin, and personnel from the Bulgarian embassy at his residence. Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü visited Foreign Minister Flandin this morning, and then went to the Premier's Office at 4 PM to pay respects to Premier Sarraut. He is scheduled to visit Minister of Commerce Pomaret at 10 AM tomorrow to discuss the adjustment of the Franco-Turkish commercial agreement, and then visit President Lebrun at the Presidential Palace. Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya left for home this afternoon. After arriving here last Saturday, he only stayed for two days as a private citizen and did not hold any diplomatic talks with French politicians. Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia, arrived here from London at 6 PM this afternoon, got off at the Gare du Nord, and went to the residence of Prince Nicholas of Greece. (Note: Prince Nicholas is Prince Paul's father-in-law and the father-in-law of the Duke of Kent, the fourth brother of the British King.) He is scheduled to visit Foreign Minister Flandin at 6 PM tomorrow afternoon. Austrian Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg is also scheduled to visit Foreign Minister Flandin at 3 PM tomorrow afternoon. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Lozoraitis arrived here from London yesterday and visited Foreign Minister Flandin at 3:30 PM this afternoon. He is scheduled to leave for home tomorrow. King Carol of Romania received French Army Chief of Staff General Gamelin at the "Ritz" Hotel today. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris – President Lebrun is scheduled to visit King Boris of Bulgaria at the Bulgarian Embassy at 5 PM this afternoon. Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia, is scheduled to visit President Lebrun at 4 PM this afternoon. In addition, French Premier Sarraut and Foreign Minister Flandin are scheduled to visit Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia, at 5 PM and 6 PM, respectively. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>End of Paris Talks: French Foreign Minister Informs Britain</h3>
<p>Content Focuses on Collective Movement</p>
<p>Paris – Foreign Minister Flandin recently met with British Ambassador to France, Sir Clerk, to inform Clerk of the results of his talks with King Carol of Romania, Foreign Minister Titulescu of Romania, King Boris of Bulgaria, and Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü. According to sources from this agency, the talks held in Paris at this time focused on the organization of the collective security system. In the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente countries, there is a strong desire to find a final and concrete interpretation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant (i.e., the article concerning sanctions and mutual assistance measures) and the principles of collective security. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>London – When Foreign Secretary Eden recently held talks with French Foreign Minister Flandin, it is reported that the issue of concluding a Mediterranean pact was considered. This matter has recently been confirmed by semi-official sources. It is said that the two were unable to proceed with negotiations due to the current situation of the Italian-Abyssinian issue, and they wanted to find a way to hold negotiations on the general issue of the Mediterranean system. This plan is not opposed in Britain, but it is believed that whether the outcome will be successful is still unknown. Therefore, the task of contacting Italy is entrusted to France. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia and Britain Review Changes in the European Situation</h3>
<p>Deputy Minister of Defense Visits British Naval Chief of Staff</p>
<p>London – After Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov departed for France, Deputy Minister of Defense General Tukhachevsky remained in Britain and visited British Naval Chief of Staff Sir Chatfield today. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>London – When Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov was in London the other day, he met with King Edward VIII and held talks with Foreign Secretary Eden. There has been much speculation about the relationship of these talks, some of which are excessive. Well-informed sources have clarified that the talks between the King, Foreign Secretary and Litvinov were purely of a general nature. The topics discussed were all previous issues and not related to the future situation. Both sides are pleased that the development of the European situation shows a trend towards collective action and reviewed the existing crises in Europe, among which the changes in German policy are particularly important. For example, the country's current intention to redeploy fortifications on the left bank of the Rhine is one example. Regarding this, Litvinov expressed deep concern, while Eden believes there is no imminent danger. This is the point of disagreement between the two. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Britain Strengthens National Defense: Germany Expresses Concern</h3>
<p>But Also Spares No Effort in Rearming</p>
<p>Berlin – German newspapers expressed concern yesterday about Britain's talk of increasing national defense, but Germany is currently rearming at a rapid pace. It is learned that by the end of this year, Germany may complete the organization of the 36 divisions of the German army announced by German leader Hitler on May 1, 1935. At that time, Germany will have a standing army of more than 500,000 men, and the number of people who have undergone some training and can enter trench warfare will be at least 1.6 million. It is widely believed that the German Air Force currently has only 1,000 aircraft on the first line of defense, but this number will soon increase to 2,000. German aircraft factories are currently expanding actively, with the goal of manufacturing 4,000 aircraft per year. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung recently published an article commenting on the diplomatic talks held by the authorities of various countries in London and Paris, especially the rapprochement between Britain and Russia, saying, "The political and diplomatic authorities of various countries first met in London and then gathered in Paris. This gathering is no less than a diplomatic conference. Among European politicians, the busiest is British Foreign Secretary Eden, and it is because of Eden that Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov wants to interfere in Western European affairs. The new strategies being planned in London and Paris are nothing more than making the Soviet Union's position in Western Europe the same as the position Italy wants to assume in the Balkan Peninsula." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin – The Frankfurter Zeitung recently published an editorial discussing various current events, especially two issues: the demilitarized zone on the Rhine and the collective security plan. It said, "The Treaty of Versailles unilaterally abolished Germany's armaments on the Rhine. If this provision is to be respected, the countries concerned must not undermine the Locarno Pact with unilateral military agreements or other means that are unfavorable to Germany. The Locarno Pact also reaffirmed the demilitarized zone on the Rhine. In addition, the Treaty of Versailles also has other unilateral provisions that Germany does not recognize, such as the internationalization of German waterways, the tragic phenomenon of the Memel autonomous region, and the establishment of mandated territories. The latter is the most important, and the purpose of the countries that initiated this system was to deprive Germany of its colonies." The newspaper then expressed its disagreement with the various local pacts concluded by various countries, saying that they have exceeded the scope of arbitration or neutrality. "The problem is that after the conclusion of active mutual assistance measures, there may not necessarily be a sense of security between each other. In short, if the collective security system is to live up to its name, the countries concerned must not, at least, establish treaties of a military nature or agreements similar to alliances. Only in this way can other countries be attracted to join happily." (Havas, 4th)</p>

<p>League of Nations Expert Committee Studies Oil Embargo Against Italy</p>
<p>Rapidly Drafting Report</p>
<p>Italy Considers Boycott Measures</p>
<p>Numbers Published on Global Petroleum Trade</p>
<p>Geneva – The League of Nations Expert Committee held its first meeting here today. Mexican Ambassador to Paris Gómez served as chairman. Gómez is the most vocal advocate for an oil embargo. The following countries participated in the meeting: Britain, France, Iraq, Iran, Mexico, Norway, Netherlands, Peru, Romania, Sweden, Soviet Russia, and Venezuela. Argentina was also invited to participate but did not send a representative. Uruguay and Cuba both stated they would send representatives but did not appear. Venezuela only attended as an observer. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Geneva – The Expert Committee held two resolutions in a meeting today to study the oil embargo against Italy. It will hold a second meeting tomorrow. The committee hopes to complete its report by the end of this week for the consideration of the Committee of Eighteen. Qualified observers here believe that a majority of the Committee of Eighteen will support implementing the oil embargo on a scheduled date because the implementation of the oil embargo has already been agreed upon in principle. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Geneva – The League of Nations Expert Committee is drafting measures to implement an embargo on petroleum against Italy. Today, it considered rumors that Poland refused to participate in the oil embargo to be unfounded and said that the League of Nations has not invited Poland to send a representative because only countries that produce and export petroleum are invited to attend. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Geneva – The Expert Committee on the petroleum embargo issue recently appointed representatives from Britain, the Netherlands, and Norway to form a committee to study the transportation of petroleum and its by-products imported by Italy. It was decided to study the following points: 1. The carrying capacity of Italian oil tankers. 2. The carrying capacity of oil tankers flying the flags of non-League of Nations member states, whether they can be used to load oil for Italy currently or in the future. 3. Whether non-League of Nations member states can only use their own ships for their own commercial purposes (referring to not transporting petroleum for other countries). 4. Where all petroleum is loaded and where it is transported to. 5. Indirect transportation (i.e., oil produced by League of Nations member states is first transported to ports of non-member states and then re-exported to Italy). (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Geneva – Representatives from twelve League of Nations member states that are also oil-producing countries have gradually taken action to embargo oil against Italy. At the same time, after economic experts made preliminary studies on various issues related to the oil embargo against Italy, two subcommittees have been established. One is studying whether Italy's petroleum supply can be completely cut off, and the other is studying whether Italy can be fatally struck after all oil transportation activities are completely prohibited. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Geneva – The Expert Committee on the petroleum embargo issue appointed by the Committee of Eighteen of the League of Nations met today and published the following figures after reviewing the global petroleum trade situation:</p>
<p>The total global petroleum production in 1934-1935 was 206,000,000 tons, of which the United States produced 88,000,000 tons, the Soviet Union produced 15,000,000 tons, Venezuela produced 14,000,000 tons, Romania produced 5,500,000 tons, Iran produced 4,500,000 tons, Mexico produced 1,400,000 tons, Iraq produced 340,000 tons, Colombia produced 160,000 tons, and Argentina produced 140,000 tons. The total amount of petroleum transported by ships from various countries in the same year was 8,400,000 tons, of which British and American ships each transported 2,400,000 tons, Norwegian ships transported 1,500,000 tons, and French ships transported 400,000 tons. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome – The Ministry of Vocational Groups recently appointed several experts to form a committee whose task is to draft a production plan for petroleum substitutes and study Italy's capabilities for this production business. In addition, the Official Gazette recently published an order that all merchants who manufacture and sell alcoholic beverages must report the current and annual production quantities to the authorities because the government may plan to replace petroleum with alcohol in the future to counter the petroleum embargo measures. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome – The Italian semi-official newspaper "The Voice of Fascism" revealed today that if the League of Nations takes an oil embargo against Italy, Italy will only have to use poison gas extensively in Abyssinian territory to retaliate. In short, Italy is determined to resist sanctions to the best of its ability. At the same time, the Official Gazette reported on the situation on the southern front, claiming that the Italian army led by General Graziani is currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the remnants of Abyssinian General Ras Desta.

<h3>Abyssinian Army Heavily Encircles, Capture of Makale Imminent</h3>
<p>Water Sources Cut Off, Isolating Italian Army</p>
<p>Abyssinian Army Actively Reinforcing Southern Front</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital – According to unconfirmed reports from the northern front, the Abyssinian army will recapture Makale imminently because the Abyssinian army has surrounded the city and cut off the main water source that Makale relies on. Furthermore, the Italian troops defending Makale are now isolated due to the long transportation routes.</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital – According to war reports received today, the battles on both fronts are very calm. In the southern and southwestern provinces, the Abyssinian army is implementing a large-scale reorganization. Twenty thousand troops are acting on the front line, and the weak points of the front line have been strengthened with troops. A rapid reinforcement team of 50,000 men has now begun to be organized, which can provide assistance at any time in case of unexpected attacks. After three weeks of heavy rain, the weather has cleared up today, which is very convenient for the Abyssinian army's actions. This rapid military action is also due to the anticipation of the rainy season. Once the rainy season begins, it will be very difficult for the large army to act. At the same time, the work of training new troops in the capital and other places is being intensified. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris – Prime Minister Mussolini met with a reporter from "Le Paris Soir" in Rome, saying that he has great confidence in the new developments in the war in Abyssinia and firmly believes that the final victory will not belong to Abyssinia. The imminent rainy season will not reduce his optimism. He said that if it rains for four hours a day and the rest of the time is expected to be sunny, this alone is enough to maintain the morale of the Italian army. On the contrary, the Abyssinian army may have difficulty transporting weapons and food. Mussolini said that in any case, the rainy season cannot stop the Italian army from advancing. Although the difficulties in the front are great, the Italian army can eventually advance slowly. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Naval Issues: Britain and the United States Have a Secret Agreement</h3>
<p>Established Around October Last Year</p>
<p>London – According to what our naval correspondent knows, France and Italy have expressed hesitation about inviting Germany to participate. However, this matter is secondary. The most important issue at present is the tonnage of battleships. Britain and the United States advocate 35,000 tons, while France and Italy demand a reduction to 27,000 tons. Each holds its own view and insists on it, and the situation is enough to hinder the future of the Four-Power Agreement. From the perspective of France and Italy, Britain originally advocated 25,000 tons as the tonnage of battleships and considered the 27,000 tons proposed by France to be too high. Now it has suddenly changed its attitude, which is difficult to understand. Some political figures believe that Britain and the United States established a secret agreement in October last year, and the content of which is still unknown to the outside world. The reason why Britain is accommodating the United States' position on the issue of battleship tonnage is precisely because of this. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Germany Has Not Complied with the London Naval Agreement</h3>
<p>Britain Indicates that it Will Not Invite Germany to Participate in the Meeting for the Time Being</p>
<p>London – The London Naval Conference may encounter new difficulties. It is heard that lawyers have discovered that Germany has not complied with the Anglo-German Naval Treaty on limiting the tonnage of warships. The Naval Conference is currently dealing with qualitative restrictions. Britain is advocating inviting Germany to participate in the conference at an appropriate time, but it is heard that France is vigorously opposing Germany's participation in the discussion. At the same time, the dispute between the French and American representatives over the model of battleships has also dimmed the atmosphere for establishing an understanding on qualitative restrictions. It is heard that the United States has accepted Britain's request and will no longer build large cruisers, on the condition that the tonnage of each battleship is limited to 35,000 tons. However, France insists on a limit of 27,000 tons. The above two points are currently being dealt with in informal talks. At the same time, the subcommittee has approved the principle proposed by the United States to extend the age of battleships to 26 years. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London – Regarding the issue of inviting Germany to participate in the Naval Conference, British officials recently stated that Britain does not intend to invite Germany to participate hastily before the Four-Power Naval Agreement is negotiated. However, it is believed that the naval agreement can hardly be effective unless it is of a universal nature or has a considerable degree of universality. Britain is currently considering inviting Germany and other countries to participate once the Four-Power Agreement is negotiated. As for whether this issue has been raised for discussion at the conference, France has not yet expressed any objection. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>London – The expert subcommittee organized by the General Committee of the Naval Conference continued to discuss the definitions of various warships this afternoon. According to what our correspondent knows, the subcommittee has not yet established any concrete agreement, but has decided to continue working according to the following principles: 1. The distinction between battleships and cruisers is often based on the armaments installed on the ships, as stipulated in the Washington Treaty. If the German pocket battleship "Deutschland" has a gun caliber of 10 inches, which is not the 8 inches stipulated by the Washington Treaty for Class A cruisers, it should still be classified as a battleship. 2. The definition of aircraft carriers should still be based on what is stated in the Washington Treaty, that is, any warship, regardless of the number of aircraft it carries, should not be considered an aircraft carrier if it does not have the characteristics of an aircraft carrier (referring to the deck for aircraft takeoff and landing). In addition, the subcommittee accepted the US request today to increase the service age of battleships from 20 years to 26 years. This measure extends the service life of 35,000-ton battleships without having to rush to replace them, thereby increasing expenses. As for whether small warships such as shallow-water coastal defense ships should also be subject to qualitative restrictions, it is currently pending resolution. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>US Neutrality Act: Fierce Debate in Congress</h3>
<p>Senate Still Divided</p>
<p>Washington - The fierce debate in Congress regarding the US Neutrality Act may result in expanding current neutrality restrictions and prohibiting loans to belligerent nations. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee remains divided, and newspapers nationwide also have differing opinions, reflecting the public's concerned state regarding the neutrality issue. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington - Former International Court of Justice Judge Moore today launched a major attack on the government's Neutrality Act, calling it a ridiculous measure that not only fails to aid peace but could even promote war. Moore told the Foreign Relations Committee that the danger of the bill lies in granting the government the authority, in the name of promoting peace, to act in a non-neutral manner. He stated that Section Four of the bill grants the president the power to control exports, which will inevitably lead to favoring one side and being drawn into the conflict. This will also invite armed resistance from those capable of retaliation. Furthermore, using peacetime raw material export volumes as a standard is also unhelpful because if the US wants to export these materials to both warring parties, it must bear the responsibility of protecting the transport ships. Mr. [蒲氏] believes the main purpose of this bill is simply to cooperate with the League of Nations. Meanwhile, Chinese Ambassador to the US, Shih Chao-chi, gave a speech at the 列丘曼 Women's Club, expressing opinions that differed greatly from those mentioned above. Mr. Shih urged the audience to strengthen international cooperation to prevent aggressive nations unbound by the non-war pact and the League of Nations charter, and urged the US not to be satisfied with a form of isolationist neutrality.

<h3>Current Greek Prime Minister to Form Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>Former Agriculture Minister and Former Aviation Minister Do Not Cooperate</p>
<p>Athens - After the results of the parliamentary elections were announced, Prime Minister Demertzis submitted his resignation to King George II. The King, considering that the new parliament would not be convened until the 12th of this month, and that the divisions among the parties were not yet clear, retained Demertzis in office. According to reliable sources, Demertzis has been able to enlist the leaders of various political parties to form a coalition cabinet and will serve as Prime Minister himself. However, former Agriculture Minister Diaodos (who co-founded the United Party with the late Regent General Kondylis) and former Aviation Minister Rallis have already declared their refusal to cooperate with the Liberal Party led by former Prime Minister Venizelos because of their dissatisfaction with the reinstatement of military ranks to officers who participated in the revolution last March. Regarding the issue of the General Staff's opposition to the reinstatement of military ranks for officers, it is now known that the King has decided to appoint Prime Minister Demertzis to be responsible for conducting negotiations with the leaders of various political parties. If this can be resolved satisfactorily, all political problems can be solved easily. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>Three Ministries of Japan - Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy - Agree on Policies Towards China and Russia</h3>
<p>The Three Principles of Hirota Remain Central to Policy Toward China</p>
<p>Determining the Russian-Manchurian Border - Negotiations to Be Submitted to Russia</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japan, in order to consolidate its China policy, is implementing a unified front. It has decided to recall Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi, and replace him with Ambassador to Belgium, Arita. It has also decided to expand and strengthen its garrison in China in mid-May, based on its activities in North China. Recently, the military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in China, Major General Isoya, was ordered to return home to provide a detailed explanation of our country's political situation. It is reported that after Ambassador Ariyoshi returns home, the Japanese government will hold a joint meeting of the three ministries—Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy—centered on the new Ambassador to China, Arita, to determine a detailed policy towards China. This policy towards China will continue to center on the Three Principles of Hirota, with the aim of realizing them. Ambassador to China Arita and Major General Isoya will return to China to negotiate after the Japanese government has decided on the second phase of its China policy. (Hualian Telegraph on the 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Due to the tense situation on the Russian-Manchurian border, the Japanese Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy held a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs conference room at 1:00 PM on the 4th to discuss countermeasures. Attendees included Director-General of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Togo; Director-General of the East Asian Affairs Bureau, Kuwashima; Director of the Army Ministry, Okamura; Squad Leader of the Soviet Russian Section, Kawahou; Squad Leader of the Manchurian-Mongolian Section, Kage; Chief of the Military Affairs Division, Murakami; and relevant officials from the Navy Ministry.</p>
<p>First, Directors-General Togo and Kuwashima explained the recent pro-French and British policies of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's propaganda regarding the secret Japanese-German treaty, and reported on the state of Soviet security work being carried out on the western border, and the joint anti-communism defense work being carried out on the eastern border. Then, the entire group discussed the mutiny of the Manchurian troops on the 29th and the Russian-Manchurian troop conflict on the 30th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs put forward this decision for countermeasures at the meeting. According to the investigation by the local authorities, it is quite clear that the mutiny of the Manchurian troops was instigated by the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the conflict on the 30th occurred because Russian troops crossed the border. The Japanese government should lodge a serious protest to the Soviet Union. The root cause of such incidents occurring between Russia and Manchuria is the ambiguity of the national border, so the Soviet Union should be urged to express its attitude on the Manchurian-Russian border demarcation committee case that the Japanese government has proposed. After the Three Ministries meeting decided on countermeasures on the 4th, Foreign Minister Hirota instructed the ambassador to Russia to lodge a protest and, at the same time, begin negotiations with the Soviet ambassador to Japan to determine the border issue. (Dohmei News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet government authorities, on the 3rd, clarified the policy on handling border disputes in the name of the Far Eastern Command and proposed the formation of a fair investigation committee. The Soviet Union's so-called fair committee seems to be an investigation committee composed of third-party countries that do not include permanent affairs countries. The Soviet Union once advocated on October 12, 1935, to organize a mixed commission of the Russian, Japanese, and "Manchurian" three countries, and now it has decided to deal with border issues by the third-party committee, which is understandable that it attaches importance to the general nature of border issues.

<h3>Heavy Snowstorm in Japan: Only Seen Since Meiji Year 20</h3>
<p>Transportation Disrupted, Damages Extremely Severe</p>
<p>Rough Seas Cause Ship Accidents</p>
<p>Tokyo - Since noon on the 4th, a heavy snowstorm suddenly began in Tokyo and other places, with the ground already covered in over a foot of snow. It became even more violent at night, and transportation was completely cut off. Incidents of collisions involving cars and streetcars occurred frequently, and order was extremely chaotic. This heavy snow is a new record since Meiji Year 20, and the damage is very severe. The Tokyo Municipal Electric Railway has ordered the emergency recruitment of 20,000 workers and 2,000 freight cars by dawn on the 5th in preparation for snow removal work. If it continues to snow at dawn on the 5th, then all government offices and bank personnel in the city will have concerns about being unable to move. (Dohmei News Agency dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Yokohama - The area suddenly experienced a strong gale with wind speeds of 15 meters per second, coupled with heavy snow. Traffic order in the city was extremely chaotic. Countless large and small ships inside and outside the port were unable to move forward or backward. Numerous small boats were sunk, and the raging waves in the harbor were extremely dangerous.

<h3>Severe Cold in the Eastern US: Almost Entirely a World of Ice</h3>
<p>The Hudson River Also Freezes</p>
<p>New York - The climate in the Eastern United States has been severely cold recently. The waters around Tangier Island off the coast of Virginia are surrounded by ice. The Hudson River in New York State has also frozen, causing the port of New York to be filled with huge ice floes, extending west along the coast to the Washington Bridge. According to a ship captain, his ship saw ice floes drifting near the coast when entering the harbor. In addition, Nantucket Island off the coast of Massachusetts, ten kilometers from the coast, is also trapped by ice, and communication between the island and the mainland is completely cut off. The 3,300 residents of the island used to receive bread daily by ship from the mainland, but due to the blockage of traffic, the source has been cut off. Although there are two bakers on the island, it is difficult to supply the needs of the entire island's residents, so there is a great risk of food shortage on the island. The authorities have dispatched an aircraft carrying 700 kilograms of food to the island to provide relief. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>US Agricultural Production Control: Three Bills Requested to Be Repealed</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Message to Congress</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt, in his message to Congress today, advocated the speedy repeal of the Bankhead Cotton Control Act, the Kerr-Smith Tobacco Act, and the 1935 Potato Act. The message was very short, stating that the agricultural adjustment program has ended, and these three acts are all its accessories, so he has this proposal. People in Washington were greatly shocked by this news, and political leaders felt it was strange, but they felt that this proposal may be related to the government's efforts to develop a new rural relief plan to replace the illegal AAA. The lawsuit filed by the Governor of Georgia alleging the illegality of the Bankhead Cotton Control Act will continue to be heard by the Supreme Court tomorrow, where the government will present its reasons for requesting the dismissal of the lawsuit.

<h3>Treasury Approves Supplemental Budget</h3>
<p>Washington - The Treasury Department today approved a supplemental budget of $367,700,000, of which $296,185,000 is for subsidies paid to farmers across the country, that is, the contracts signed by the government and farmers before the Agricultural Adjustment Act became invalid.

<p>Washington - The faction in Congress advocating currency inflation through the Agricultural Mortgage Refinancing Act has suddenly changed its plan and reached a tacit understanding with the faction advocating for veteran bonuses. Therefore, the huge sum of $2,237,000,000 required for the veteran bonus bill was quickly passed today. The agricultural faction's sudden change of plan is due to the veteran bonus faction's opposition to attaching an inflationary clause to the veteran bonus bill. At the same time, it is known that the agricultural bill needs only three more signatures to force a congressional vote. The faction hopes that the veteran bonus inflation faction led by Patman will soon provide support. Currently, the inflation faction plans to temporarily suspend the movement to issue more banknotes to await President Roosevelt's submission of a new tax bill. (National Telegraph on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>US Gold Reverse Flow: Using This to Maintain the Dollar's Status</h3>
<p>Fears of Currency Inflation Dispelled</p>
<p>Washington - The US Treasury Department today approved the shipment of $5,240,000 in cash to France and $365,000 to the Netherlands. At the same time, the US dollar was greatly depreciated in the foreign exchange market. Treasury officials stated that if the dollar falls below the gold export point in the future, they will issue permits at any time to ship cash to gold standard countries. Cash has been flowing into the US for several months, causing the US gold reserves to break all records. Today's outflow is the first reverse flow decision. Officials are unwilling to comment on this matter, but some people have stated that they believe this trend is actually a good development because on the one hand, it can assist other countries' cash reserves, and at the same time, it can reduce the tendency of domestic credit inflation. (National Telegraph Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>New York - According to the report issued today by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, cash worth US$5.6 million has been shipped to France from the bank's vault. From this point of view, it seems that the direction of cash flow has reversed in recent months. It is said that the Treasury Department approved the outflow of cash, apparently because this can maintain the status of the US dollar and dispel European concerns about US currency inflation.

<p>Washington - Treasury Secretary Morgenthau confirmed to reporters the claim that the United States is releasing gold to Europe, but only said that the US Treasury is prepared to allow gold to continue to be shipped out while exercising the current foreign exchange system.

<h3>Dutch Bank Reduces Discount Rate</h3>
<p>London - The interest rate of the Dutch Bank was reduced to 2.5% today, restoring the standard of April 1935. Since the end of September last year, financial matters have gradually improved due to the increase in interest rates to 6%. Of the 137,000,000 florins lost in the previous six months, 133,000,000 florins have been successively recovered by the Dutch Bank. However, although the status of the Dutch currency has improved, the Dutch budget is still unsatisfactory and in a deficit situation, leading many parties to believe that the Netherlands will eventually be forced to abandon the gold standard it upholds. However, it is heard that gold-using countries are now showing signs of recovery because the price difference between gold-using countries and currency-devaluing countries is now not very large.

<h3>Britain Takes the Offensive (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By Louis Fisher, translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>——One of the Observations on the European Situation Under the Shadow of Slaughter——</p>
<p>Due to the Walwal border incident and Selassie's appeal to Geneva, the Abyssinian question has been fully embraced by the League of Nations, which London is determined to uphold. This is why Baldwin's government has gained domestic support. The large number of peace votes in the country shows how deep and pure the British people's desire for collective security is. It has also gained international support, as all countries fear that the success of aggression will drag Europe into a second great war. If an agreement had been concluded behind the League of Nations in Paris or elsewhere, Geneva might have softened, and Britain's naval demonstrations might not have amounted to much. The British fleet stationed in the Mediterranean has quickly increased from 230,000 tons on August 5, 1935, to 500,000 tons. Since 1918, Britain has never taken such decisive action. This is a natural result of the arms embargo, financial blockade, and economic sanctions decided by the League of Nations in September and October.</p>
<p>The speed and unanimity with which League and non-League members participated in the sanctions reflect Italy's moral isolation and material weakness, as well as Britain's unwavering determination. It may be easier for a powerful aggressor to deal with a small country than with Geneva. Therefore, sanctions are indeed a good method with many moral components. Although slow, this method is strict and universal, and does not lead to actual retaliation. It certainly cannot immediately stop the war, but it can limit the daily military consumption that accelerates the crisis. Not long ago, in Geneva, Paris, and London, I heard many people discussing whether sanctions should continue if Mussolini's or the Fascists' position in Italy was in danger. Sanctions can naturally be withdrawn immediately. But the biggest question is: what does Britain intend to do? Rumors of "despicable plans" to sacrifice Abyssinia can be heard every day. One moment, the British ambassador meets the Blackshirt leader in Rome; the next, Laval convenes talks on the Abyssinian issue. All the widespread plans aim to give Italy some satisfaction. Didn't former British Foreign Secretary Hoare say, "We are not without sympathy for Italy's need for expansion"? He also advocated for the redistribution of world raw materials.</p>
<p>Why is British policy so hesitant? There are many reasons, but they can all be summarized into one area. Britain's powerful circles do not want Mussolini to collapse; they are thinking about the future of European capitalism. Britain may still need Italy's help to resist France and Germany. An Italy that has been sanctioned or defeated may obediently abandon its conspiracies against the British Empire and its ambitions to seize Africa. Therefore, giving Italy a little land poses no danger to Great Britain, and it can also be used to dispel Anglo-Italian hostility. However, what if Italy, defying British mediation, joins hands with Germany and plunges all of Europe into war? This is certainly not what Britain wants. They must not push Mussolini to the point where there is no room for mediation. British armament expansionists certainly say that Mussolini's planes can destroy the British fleet. In fact, in addition to its existing strength, Britain also has the League of Nations as its backing, which is more than enough to deal with Italy. Britain's difficulty lies in the fact that she has three fronts—the Far East, the Mediterranean, and the North Sea or Central Europe. She really needs three navies. When London mobilizes on the Mediterranean front, the other two fronts must also remain active. This is another major factor in Britain's fundamental weakness. Britain's strength has been diverted by Japan's invasion of China or Germany's recent threats, which is a greater help to Mussolini. This is why the British government, in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, wants to compromise with France or Germany at the expense of the League of Nations. Of the two, the military cooperation between Britain and France is probably the most likely, and this issue is now once again in the ascendant.</p>
<p>Today's war in East Africa cannot but remind people of the Fashoda Incident. Around the time of the Fashoda Incident, British Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain wanted to ally with Germany, but Germany ignored him. In the spring of 1899, just before Britain and France resolved the Sudan issue, France asked Germany for an alliance, but Germany again ignored him. Soon, Britain and France concluded an agreement to contain Germany. Now, as a result of the Anglo-Italian contradiction, another kind of combination or conflict may arise. Nothing is more volatile than this. The colonial war in East Africa is setting the stage for the second act of the European drama.</p>
<p>It is also very clear that Britain's isolation, whether glorious or despicable, has come to an end. Only a very strong Britain can stand alone. The choice between the Empire and the Continent has become pure nonsense. There can be no Empire without Britain's power on the Continent. Every disputed border, every potential powder keg, is Britain's business, and the new Conservative cabinet should take this into account. Britain needs friends, and Britain should also build a larger air fleet and a sophisticated navy. Until it is built, she should avoid exposing weaknesses. Peace-lovers believe that collective security has been guaranteed, and that the League of Nations can reduce Britain's military budget. However, Downing Street knows the value of Geneva. It also knows that in today's chaotic world, the ultimate guarantee still lies in strength. In Europe, the arms race and Britain's power struggle are only just beginning.</p>

<h3>Prince De Returns to Pangjiang; Bao Yueqing Pays a Visit from Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>Beiping: According to Mongolian sources, Prince De has returned to Prince De's residence in Pangjiang. Mongolian political affairs are being presided over by Prince Suo, who is staying at the temple to manage everything. Prince De's representative, Bao Yueqing, went to Pangjiang and has no intention of returning to Beiping for the time being. Zhuo Shihai's actions in northern Chahar are difficult to ascertain due to communication barriers. There are rumors that Prince De will make a statement regarding the organization of the Mongolian Political Council in the Suiyuan area, but related parties have not received any official reports, so it is likely just speculation. The Mongolian Political Council in the Suiyuan area is scheduled to convene a general meeting on February 5 to discuss the organization and progress of the council. Princes and nobles from various banners are expected to arrive in Suiyuan before the Lantern Festival to attend. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<p>Chen Guangfu Authors Article Discussing China's New Monetary Policy</p>
<p>Paris: Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank of China, Chinese Director of the Shanghai Public Concession, and Chairman of the Chinese National Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, recently published an article in the journal "International Economics" discussing the new monetary policy promulgated by the Chinese government on November 4 of last year and referring to it as a step in the process of international monetary stabilization. Chen first described the process by which the Chinese government implemented the new monetary policy, stating that China was originally a silver standard country, and 95% of its foreign trade was conducted with gold standard countries or countries that controlled currency and therefore had stable currencies. China had encountered various difficulties in stabilizing its currency. Since the U.S. government implemented the Silver Purchase Act, its impact on the Chinese economy had been truly negative, eventually leading to an unprecedented panic. The Chinese government therefore implemented the new monetary policy on November 4 of last year and decided to establish a Central Reserve Bank to secure a 60% hard currency reserve for the paper currency it had issued or would issue, so as to achieve the maximum degree of stability for the Chinese currency. Chen concluded, "China's new monetary policy should not cause any anxiety. All rational people should fully support it. The Chinese government is doing this to stabilize the currency, with no other intention. The promotion of international trade depends on whether the currency can be stabilized. It can be seen that the implementation of China's new monetary policy will not only benefit China but also all countries that trade with China." In short, the current panic in China's foreign trade has greatly improved as a result, and the path to the ultimate stabilization of international currency has also been opened. The stabilization of international currency is what the International Chamber of Commerce has always advocated and what I personally sincerely pray for. (Havas dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

<h3>Impressions of Traveling North: By Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</h3>
<p>9.  The Strengthening of Eastern Hebei and Northern Chahar:</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japan's ambitions have grown increasingly fierce. In order to thoroughly implement its continental policy, it has adopted a strategy of gradual advancement and aggression, encroaching westward and southward. Towards the end of the year, in our northern provinces, problems related to "Eastern Hebei," "Northern Chahar," and "Eastern Suiyuan" were created one after another. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council, which emerged in response to these issues, had fantastical dreams of negotiating the Eastern Hebei and Northern Chahar problems. However, after two months of negotiations, there was no progress whatsoever. Furthermore, as the situations in "Eastern Hebei" and "Northern Chahar" became established facts, their influence grew, and the strength of the Hebei-Chahar authorities was gradually weakened, becoming like "a clay Buddha crossing the river, barely able to save itself."</p>
<p>When Yin Rugeng reorganized the puppet "Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Government," in his absurd and reckless declaration, he first admitted that "the advocacy of autonomy has been going on for a month, but many prominent figures are still hesitant to support it." At the end, he shamelessly boasted, "By rectifying governance and strengthening ourselves with vigilance, we can solidify Eastern Hebei's autonomy like a rock and usher in a new opportunity for national restoration." In his conversations with visiting reporters, he also made the preposterous claim that he would govern Eastern Hebei as a model zone, and then promote it throughout North China and the entire nation.</p>
<p>The Eastern Hebei war zone, which originally had the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Security Regiments, has been reorganized into official troops directly under the puppet government. They have been given new uniforms and insignias, and are now called the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Divisions. The Japanese Kwantung Army, pleased that Yin Rugeng had so skillfully carried out their intentions, greatly appreciated him, stating that if Yin Rugeng had been in Li Jichun's position in Eastern Hebei earlier, today's achievements would have been even greater. Therefore, they are now making every effort to supplement the military strength of the Eastern Hebei puppet organization.</p>
<p>There are 200 Japanese troops stationed at the Tong County Normal School, serving as a powerful bodyguard for the puppet organization's location. In the 22 counties of Eastern Hebei, the textbooks used in schools are being revised under the guise of "thoroughly eliminating Kuomintang education," but in reality, their intention is no different from promoting the enslaved textbooks currently used in the puppet "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>The Hebei-Chahar Political Council intends to invite Yin Rugeng to join as a member, or even concurrently serve as the head of Tianjin. However, Yin Rugeng still claims that the establishment of the puppet organization is not for personal power, and that anyone with the same goals can cooperate, but that he cannot discuss personal matters. It is clear that the Eastern Hebei problem will be difficult to resolve through peaceful means. A single spark can start a prairie fire, and the future hidden dangers are countless, needless to say.</p>
<p>As for "Northern Chahar" and "Eastern Suiyuan" in relation to "Eastern Hebei," there was originally a three-in-one connection. Initially, Li Shouxin's troops from the puppet "Manchukuo" occupied the Six Banners of Northern Chahar. Subsequently, the Mongolian security forces under Zhuo Shihai declared independence. It can be said that the Japanese are already in the preliminary stages of successfully creating an "Independent Inner Mongolia." The situation in Eastern Suiyuan has become increasingly serious around the Spring Festival. However, this area is not under the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Zone but under the Shanxi-Suiyuan Pacification Zone. The willingness and ability of the Shanxi-Suiyuan authorities to deal with the situation may differ from those of Hebei-Chahar. As the saying goes, "Pull one hair and the whole body moves." The new developments in Eastern Suiyuan are therefore noteworthy.</p>
<p>The Japanese and their puppets have two aims in their westward encroachment on Chahar and Suiyuan. One is to threaten Outer Mongolia from the north and copy the Soviet Russian Siberian Railway. The other is to control Inner Mongolia, connect the Ping-Sui Railway with the Bei-Ning and South Manchurian Railways, and use other forms of aggression, such as so-called "economic development" and "technical cooperation" strategies. They plan to extend the Ping-Sui Railway, pass through the Hetao region, and turn towards Ningxia, then follow the natural barrier of the Wei River and Yellow River to encircle and divide the entire land north of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this contains an important significance: to cut off China's transportation with Outer Mongolia and Soviet Russia. According to reliable sources, the Japanese side intends to present the plan to extend the Ping-Sui Railway to the relevant parties once the situation in North China has been further stabilized. They hope for... (the end of this sentence is cut off)</p>

<h3>The Evolution of 33 Types of Old Bonds</h3>
<p>—All to be Exchanged for Unified Public Bonds—</p>
<p>In February of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), due to decreased tax revenue and a sluggish bond market, the Ministry of Finance and various groups held extensive discussions to re-draft appropriate standards for the originally promulgated public bond regulations. It was also decided that 8.6 million yuan would be allocated monthly from customs duties as a fund for repaying various bonds, with an annual interest rate of six percent and an adjusted repayment period.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the severity of the national crisis has not diminished. Internally, we have suffered frequent natural disasters and banditry. Externally, we have been affected by global economic panic, coupled with the impact of rising silver prices. Government tax revenues of all kinds have decreased, and the shortfall in customs duties allocated to the bond principal and interest fund has been particularly significant. However, the government has consistently paid principal and interest on time and has never defaulted. The government's painstaking efforts to maintain this in the midst of immense financial difficulties are well known both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>However, due to the recent shortfall in customs revenue, the financial situation has become more difficult, which will affect various bond funds. In light of this severe situation, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, in order to revive the economy, stabilize finances, and maintain the credit of the bonds, consulted with the financial community and decided to issue unified public bonds to exchange for old bonds, and to issue revival public bonds to improve the health of the financial system. The Bondholders' Association has also issued a declaration supporting this move. The following is a summary of the evolution of the old bonds:</p>

<p>New Trends in the Silk Industry</p>
<p>The silk industry in our region had a relatively smooth year last year. However, due to a shortage of raw materials, five or six silk factories were forced to shut down. Since the beginning of spring, in addition to the six factories operated by silk industry magnate Xue Chou Xuan, including Yongtai, Huaxin, Jinji, Yongsheng, Longchang, and Minfeng, which resumed operations on the first of this month, the remaining factories, such as Ruichang, Ruichang Yong, Runde, Hefeng, Qian Shen, Qian Tai, Housheng, Jia Tai, Guangcheng, and Youcheng, are also expected to resume operations within a few days.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Xingye Silk Manufacturing Co., Ltd., organized by Xue Chou Xuan, Qian Feng, and others, aims to procure raw materials, manufacture, and promote various types of raw silk and by-products. The capital is set at one million yuan, divided into 10,000 shares, each worth one hundred yuan. The first half, 500,000 yuan, will be raised initially, and a public offering will be advertised in newspapers soon, with March 15th as the deadline for subscription. The company has also leased eight silk factories, including Yuankang, Qianyuan, Nanchang, Yuanji, Taichang, Yongyu, Zhenyuan, and Yongchang, as its operating scope for this year.</p>

<p>Tragic Suicide of a Female Farmer by Slitting Her Throat</p>
<p>Zhang Zhu, a rural woman from Shoushan Bridge in Zhuangzhen, is 40 years old. Her husband passed away early, but according to local custom, she could be married by her younger brother-in-law, so the family was still relatively peaceful. However, due to poor harvests in recent years, income has decreased, and Zhu became depressed. Unexpectedly, last year on Lunar New Year's Eve, a fire broke out, and all the houses and belongings were destroyed. At that time, a temporary shed was built for shelter, and Zhu's life became even more difficult.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 3rd, after her husband Lin Lin went out, she sent her children away. Zhu then used sharp scissors to cut her own throat and committed suicide. Blood flowed everywhere, and she died shortly after being moved inside. When her husband and others returned home at noon, they were distraught, and the news quickly spread. The Ding of Chu town reported to the relevant Public Security Bureau. Subsequently, the family requested an exemption from examination. After the bureau chief confirmed that Zhu had indeed committed suicide and there were no other circumstances, the exemption was granted. He also instructed the family to arrange for burial.</p>

<p>Three More County Farmers' Banks to be Established</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department stated that the various county-level agricultural financial institutions, such as farmers' banks, farmers' cooperatives, and farmers' loan offices, have reached more than 40, providing over one million yuan in loans to farmers. Rural economies have been able to circulate funds as a result. In response to the requests of cooperatives in various places, the Yongrui Pingfeng Agricultural Bank was specifically ordered to establish a water loan branch, and the Jin Yongwu Agricultural Bank to establish a cloud loan branch. The Pinghu, Haiyan, and Linhai County Farmers' Loan Offices were all reorganized and expanded into Farmers' Banks.</p>

<p>The Old Jiang Bridge to be Completed in Mid-April</p>
<p>The construction of the Old Jiang Bridge in this port, contracted by the Shanghai Kangyi Foreign Company and supervised by Zhu, has been underway for over a year, and most of the projects have been completed. However, last month, the cold weather hindered the laying of cement on the bridge deck, and the engineering office announced a suspension of work, which will resume once the weather warms up. Therefore, the entire project is expected to be completed in mid-April this year. In order to prepare for the opening, in addition to the funds already donated, there is still a shortfall of tens of thousands of yuan. It is planned to hold a bridge opening ceremony and sell certificates, using the proceeds to make up for the shortfall. If there is still a shortfall, fundraising will be conducted separately.</p>

<h3>How to Improve Students' Math Performance?</h3>
<p>— Professor Ren Mengxian of Great China University</p>
<p>(Lecture given to middle school students across the country on January 14th and 16th)</p>
<p>How can students' math performance be improved? All those engaged in math teaching constantly have this question swirling in their minds. The aspects related to this question are numerous. Without discussing those distant and broad, more immediate factors, such as school administration, school discipline, curriculum development, class size, students' entry-level, promotion standards, learning interest, and their diligence, all have a close relationship with math performance. Merely seeking solutions within the teacher alone is impossible. However, focusing solely on the teacher's aspect, from what I know: some teachers are fresh graduates from universities, possessing excellent knowledge, but their teaching is not necessarily outstanding. Some even return from studying abroad with very profound knowledge but are unable to handle middle school teaching positions. Hence, some people say that learning and teaching are two different things, and a true scholar is not necessarily a good teacher. There are also those who have been teaching for a long time with much experience, but their students' performance remains poor or even worsens. Therefore, some say that experience is unnecessary; as long as one has learned, one can teach. Which of these two views is right? I acknowledge that teaching requires knowledge, but I do not believe that those with knowledge cannot teach. If their knowledge is sufficient to teach others, how could they not be welcomed? The so-called having knowledge but not being good at teaching is just an excuse for those who fail at teaching. I also do not believe that having knowledge alone is enough to teach, or that having experience alone is enough. Fresh graduates or those who have studied abroad, though their knowledge is profound, have not taught before or have never learned how to teach, so naturally, they cannot teach well. Old teachers relying solely on old experience without seeking new knowledge or thinking of new methods, or those who have been teaching for many years but have not paid attention to research, cannot be considered experienced. Does having methods and doing research make one an ideal teacher? That depends on their personality and spirit. Therefore, math teachers—especially those who want to improve students' performance—must pay attention to the following three things:</p>
<p>Three Things:</p>
<p>First, Substantial Cultivation. An ideal teacher must possess both academic ability and experience. How can academic ability be enriched? It can be approached from both "cultivation" and "refinement":</p>
<p>Cultivation. Mathematics is a discipline with theory that needs proof, methods that need practice, clear systems, and wide application. Therefore, math teachers must have:</p>
<p>1.  Profound Theory. Although middle school teaching is limited to arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and analytical geometry, teachers should possess rich knowledge if they teach all subjects. Even if they only teach one or two subjects, they should have a higher level of knowledge in each. For example, if a teacher teaching algebra and trigonometry does not understand the properties of functions, how can they explain the concept of variable values, variable traces, what are real numbers, what are imaginary numbers? They will always feel unclear. If a teacher teaching geometry does not know the properties of modern geometry, they will find challenging proofs or difficult constructions thorny. Therefore, what is taught may be shallow, but what is learned must be deeper. Who says that calculus, function theory, modern algebra, and advanced geometry learned in universities are useless when teaching in middle schools!</p>
<p>2. Ordinary Common Knowledge. It is dangerous for a teacher's knowledge to be limited to the subject they teach. Those who teach algebra inevitably have to discuss geometry, such as the graphical solutions of equations and inequalities. Those who teach geometry inevitably have to use algebra, such as the analysis of constructions, and the limits of areas and volumes. These are natural facts. Once applied to various aspects, there is sometimes a need to discuss physics and chemistry, sometimes to discuss social sciences, and sometimes even to discuss industrial and commercial affairs. Although there is no need for specialized research, ordinary common knowledge is always necessary, especially when teaching the chapters on selection and chance in algebra, where the related matters are even more diverse, such as music, sports, and even horse racing and gambling. One must understand the rules and regulations of each, how broad is that!</p>
<p>3. Basic Calculation Skills. As mentioned above: The foundation of trigonometry lies in algebra and geometry, and the foundation of analytical geometry lies in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. The foundation of any subject lies in arithmetic. Learning mathematics should be like this, and teaching mathematics should be even more so. If a teacher teaching analytical geometry is not proficient in algebraic transformations or is not skillful in using trigonometry, it will not be easy to achieve simple results regarding axis shifts and the elimination of parameters. And the last step in solving any problem is always nothing more than addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If the teacher's calculations with numbers are slow or often contain errors, it will be even more difficult to obtain correct solutions. How can they eliminate students' confusion and increase their interest? Therefore, teachers must have sufficient training in basic calculation skills.</p>
<p>4. Mastery of the Subject Taught. Any subject, even taught chapter by chapter and section by section, must be thoroughly understood by the teacher. They should have unique insights and a bird's-eye view, avoiding a piecemeal explanation of the text without any extension. For example, to find the volume of any prism, one must first calculate the triangular prism. To calculate the triangular prism, one must first investigate the parallelepiped. Any parallelepiped is equal to a right parallelepiped with the same base and height. Therefore, if the method of measuring the volume of a right parallelepiped is clear, then the volume of any prism will be clear. However, this cannot be clearly presented unless the teacher has a perspective beforehand. Another example is high school algebra textbooks, which, apart from the initial part which is a review, mostly list various methods that are hardly related to each other. The teacher should have an overview of the entire book and find ways to connect them. As for teachers who cannot explain the next section without preparing the previous section, they are naturally prone to failure.</p>
<p>Refinement. Even if the foundation of knowledge is deep and the usual cultivation is good, academic progress is rapid. If one cannot adapt to the times and engage in further exploration without falling behind, one will stop at a certain stage and have no possibility of upward evolution. Therefore, an ideal teacher must both teach and learn. They do not need to re-enter any school or study abroad, and they can continue to improve themselves. The method of improvement is to read new books and famous magazines. It is often seen that on a teacher's desk, apart from the current textbook and a few textbooks read during their student days, there are no other books. The equipment of their school is also very simple, so they have no reference materials for the subjects they teach. In this situation, how can they improve? Therefore, teachers should do their best to acquire new books and magazines. If necessary, they should also try to borrow them. They should read more of the publications that are directly beneficial to what they teach so that their views will not be biased in one corner. In addition, they should participate in academic groups and attend academic lectures or workshops to receive new knowledge and solve doubts. These are all good opportunities to supplement teachers' cultivation, and teachers should make full use of them.</p>
<p>Experience is another aspect of cultivation, but it cannot be obtained while working as a school guard or while improving oneself after serving. In other words, this kind of cultivation is not knowledge learned from books but lessons learned from actual teaching. For example, when a teacher first teaches a certain subject or chooses a certain textbook for the first time, where can the book be omitted? Where should it be supplemented? Where is it easier to proceed faster? Where is it more complicated and must be explained in detail? Nothing can be known. It must be used two or three times before one can add one's own ideas. Other similar practical problems must be repeatedly tested to find more effective examples, which teachers can encounter anytime and anywhere. However, newly graduated teachers often claim to have deep knowledge and see the subjects they teach too superficially, thinking that they can teach by slightly extracting what they have learned, not considering whether there are any practical problems, let alone how to solve them. Or there are those who have been teaching for many years, used to a few books, done hundreds of exercises, and always teach like this semester after semester. They have no new feelings about the environment and the object being taught, and they do not feel any doubt. One of these two types of teachers has no experience at all, and the other has experience but it is equivalent to nothing. Neither can improve students' performance. Therefore, an ideal teacher must attach importance to experience, and the most valuable experience is:</p>
<p>Objective Understanding. Teachers must have ideals about teaching methods. However, if they rely solely on subjective imagination without considering the actual situation, they may have many theories but no experience. Therefore, experience must be based on facts, that is, teaching experience should be sought from teaching itself. For example, the questions raised by students in class, the errors or misinterpretations in exercises, and the performance shown in exams can all trigger a definite reaction from the teacher, which is sufficient to prove whether the teaching is appropriate and effective. The so-called "teaching and learning enhance each other" is indeed an indelible saying!</p>
<p>Enlightenment After Failure. A lucky teacher may be able to do what they planned because the students are at the same level, or because the students have never paid attention to what is taught, and no matter how they are taught, they never feel any difficulty. However, problems will arise once the object changes. In fact, it is not easy to be a teacher, and mathematics teachers, in particular, are not allowed to be casual. Anyone with sufficient academic ability cannot guarantee that they will not fail, but if they are enlightened by failure and improve because of enlightenment, then more failures mean more experience, and more experience means fewer failures. The experience gained through hardship is the most reliable, intimate, and flavorful. The so-called "failure is the mother of success" is something no one can deny!</p>
<p>However, experience must also be able to distinguish and organize, knowing what is right and continuing it, knowing what is wrong and correcting it, otherwise, fragmented pieces, right and wrong mixed, what is the use? Therefore, if a teacher can give appropriate consideration after gaining experience, write down a few systematic experience results for their own use in the future, and also for others to refer to, then their teaching performance will surely improve day by day. A teacher who makes good use of experience in this way is both improving their cultivation and researching methods. Good and practical teaching methods are obtained in this way!</p>
<p>Second, Research on Methods. No one denies that elementary school teachers must have methods in teaching, but middle school teachers are different. Recently, some people have even advocated that middle school teachers do not need special training. Anyone who graduates from university can go to middle school to teach based on what they have learned. Even those who come from higher normal schools sometimes only pay attention to the teaching material and neglect the teaching method. It has been seen that teachers do not realize the reasons for their teaching failures and the reasons for students' poor performance. They often lament that their knowledge may not be inferior to others, or denounce students as unworthy of teaching, without knowing that the effectiveness of teaching, apart from the teacher's substance, depends on the method. In particular, mathematics is a subject that is generally considered difficult to learn, and students' performance cannot be improved without a teacher who has methods.</p>
<p>What is the content of middle school mathematics teaching methods? It cannot be described in a short time. Generally speaking, there are teaching principles, teaching procedures, and performance evaluation. Classified, there are arithmetic teaching methods, algebra teaching methods, geometry and trigonometry teaching methods, etc. All of these are matters studied in the courses taught by university education colleges or higher normal departments, and there are books to read, so I won't talk too much. I will only offer some opinions on several commonly used teaching methods and issues related to after-class handling.</p>

<h3>Newly Appointed Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, to Take Office Next Month</h3>
<p>Attended Ambassador Arim's Tea Party Last Night, Scheduled to Go to Beijing in a Week to Seek Instructions from the Authorities</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The successor to our country's ambassador to Japan, after Jiang Zuobin was transferred back to China to head the Ministry of Interior, has been repeatedly considered by the central government. Xu Shiying, who is highly respected, was mostly favored. After obtaining Xu's consent, the Executive Yuan meeting yesterday approved the appointment of Xu as the special envoy and plenipotentiary ambassador to Japan. Xu is now preparing for departure procedures and is expected to take office next month.</p>
<p>Outstanding Achievements in Leading Disaster Relief Efforts. Xu has been leading national disaster relief efforts for several years. In recent years, various provinces have suffered from floods and droughts almost constantly. Therefore, Xu has been tirelessly traveling to various disaster areas to handle disaster relief matters and has made outstanding achievements. The disaster victims in various provinces have also deeply felt Xu's kindness and grace. However, due to his advanced age and declining strength, Xu felt overwhelmed by this important task and repeatedly requested the central government to resign from his position as chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, expressing his willingness to continue speaking for the disaster victims in the private sector to complete his initial aspiration to engage in charitable work. At this time, the central government was considering candidates for the ambassador to Japan, mostly favoring Xu to take the position. President Jiang and Foreign Minister Zhang repeatedly summoned Xu to Beijing to seek his consent. In view of the importance of current Sino-Japanese relations, Xu felt duty-bound and readily agreed to take on the difficult task. It was approved yesterday at the 248th Executive Yuan meeting and formally appointed.</p>
<p>Staying in Shanghai for a Week Before Going to Beijing. Xu arrived in Beijing a few days ago to pay respects to key figures in the central government and completed the winding up of the Disaster Relief Committee and the Huangshan Construction Committee, which he originally chaired, in order to facilitate the handover. After leaving Beijing on the evening of the 3rd and arriving in Shanghai, he returned to his residence to rest. At noon yesterday, he went out, first to the private residence of Director Zhou of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Luban Road to visit Zhou, who was out. Then he went to the Huangshan Office and Renji Hall to handle official business. At 5 pm, he attended the tea party of Japanese Ambassador Arima Akira. Xu is expected to stay in Shanghai for a week before going to Beijing to seek instructions from the authorities and complete departure procedures. It is expected that he will be able to leave the country with two attendants at the beginning of next month to take office in Japan.</p>
<p>Successor to the Disaster Relief Committee Already Determined Internally. The Huangshan Construction Committee, chaired by Xu, has been temporarily taken over by Zhang Zhizhong, who has been very enthusiastic about the Huangshan construction project in the past and will definitely be able to complete the Huangshan construction project after Xu. As for whether the Shanghai Office of the committee will be abolished, it remains to be decided. It is also heard that the central government has internally decided that Zhu Qinglan will succeed as chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee. Zhu has been handling disaster relief for many years and has always been enthusiastic about charitable work. Once his consent is obtained, it can be formally appointed by the Executive Yuan meeting.</p>
<p>Xu Issued a Written Statement. Xu issued a written statement yesterday, saying, "Although I have been in politics for many years, I have never served in diplomacy. This time, the government has decided to appoint me as the ambassador to Japan. I really feel a great responsibility, and my talents and experience are difficult to bear. I cannot refuse. I only have the spirit of serving the country and society as always, and I will do my best to be loyal, follow the government, and strive to serve. It is hoped that the atmosphere between the two countries will improve based on sincere efforts so that everything has a normal path to follow. The improvement of Sino-Japanese relations is expected, and the situation in the Far East will naturally tend to stabilize. I hope that my compatriots across the country will provide more guidance, and friends from friendly countries will provide assistance so that I can fulfill my duty to promote friendly relations between the two countries. It is not only my personal happiness." It is estimated that more than 400 leading figures from Chinese and foreign communities attended. Arima is scheduled to leave Shanghai by ship on the evening of the 7th to return to Japan. Japanese Ambassador to China Arima Akira, due to his imminent departure, visited Mayor Wu of the city government yesterday morning to bid farewell and held a grand tea party at his residence from 5 pm to 7 pm to entertain leading figures from Chinese and foreign communities. He is scheduled to board the Japanese postal ship Chichibu Maru and leave Shanghai on the evening of the 7th to return to his country. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

The mayor often personally extended the meeting with Wang Changchun, a specialist from the Municipal Government, and welcomed him into the guest room, entertaining him with champagne. They talked cordially for twenty minutes before Arima took his leave.</p>
<p>Grand Tea Party.

<h3>Commerce and China Printing Houses to Print Unified and Reconstruction Bonds</h3>
<p>Contract to be Signed after Procedures are Negotiated, Exchange Method to be Drafted by the Ministry of Finance. Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the total amount of the Unified Public Bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China is 146 million yuan, and the total amount of the Reconstruction Public Bonds is 34 million yuan. The bonds will be printed by the Commercial Press and the China Book Bureau. The Commerce and China Publishing Houses have been in contact with Jiang Lufu, the director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, to negotiate the printing procedures. After the negotiation is completed, a printing contract will be signed. It is expected that all printing will be completed by the end of March. After the printing is completed and sent to the Ministry of Finance, a notice will be issued to recall the old public bonds and exchange them for new public bonds in accordance with the regulations of A, B, C, D, and E.</p>
<p>Method of Exchanging Public Bonds. The method of recalling the old public bonds of A, B, C, D, and E and exchanging them for unified new public bonds has been drafted by the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance. It is heard that no matter what kind of old public bonds they are, they will be exchanged for new public bonds at the full face value. No matter what kind of old treasury bills, they will be exchanged for new public bonds according to the actual number. From now on, there will be no distinction between treasury bills and public bonds. The interest rate is 6 percent, and the principal and interest will be repaid by lottery every six months. However, the repayment of principal and interest will still be handled by the National Debt Fund Management Committee.</p>
<p>Securities Still Suspended Yesterday. After the Chinese Merchants' Clearing House was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to temporarily suspend trading, the date of resumption of trading must be determined by the order of the Ministry. In the future, when the Unified Public Bonds are traded, only types A, B, C, D, and E will be allowed. It is heard that futures trading will be suspended.</p>
<h3>Silver and Banking Industries Decide to Form a Committee to Study the Issue of Interest Rate Reduction</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Money Industry Association held its annual meeting and luncheon at the Inner Garden of the City God Temple in the South City at 12:00 noon today. All village managers attended. In addition to reporting on the association's affairs, the meeting also discussed the business policy after the market opening. As for the case of reducing interest rates ordered by the Ministry of Finance, it was decided to propose it for discussion. The association has decided to hold another annual meeting at the Money Industry Hall in the North City on the 10th to worship the past directors. Regarding the case of reducing interest rates ordered by the Ministry of Finance, Chen Guangfu and He Zhongxiao, chairmen of the Silver and Banking Industry Associations, contacted each other once yesterday and decided that the two associations would separately hold meetings to nominate committee members and then hold a joint meeting to jointly study the issue. The Money Industry Association has decided to submit it to today's annual meeting for discussion, and the Banking Association is scheduled to hold a meeting today to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Gu Xinyi Discusses Shanghai Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Issuing New Public Bonds Can Prevent Speculation; Cash Transactions in Various Industries Reduce Self-Risk</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the impact of the global economic recession, domestic industry and commerce have been in a slump. Although the authorities have tried their best to seek relief last year, it is still difficult to recover in a short time. Therefore, at the end of the year, there was no improvement in collecting accounts receivable. Therefore, various industries have agreed that starting this year, all goods will be traded mainly in cash. The Central News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, who said as follows:</p>
<p>Cash Transactions Facilitate Turnover</p>
<p>Although this city is the center of national industry and commerce, it has been affected by the global economic recession, and various businesses have been in a slump. For the banking industry, investment in industry and commerce is very small except for foreign exchange and collateral loans, resulting in difficulties in turnover for various industries, and the scope of business has to be tightened. Starting this year, various industries have decided to trade in cash. Although this has a great impact on business development, it is a last resort to reduce their own risks.</p>
<p>Support the Issuance of Two New Public Bonds</p>
<p>The decision of the Ministry of Finance to issue the Unified and Revival Public Bonds is of great significance to the prosperity of industry and commerce. In the past, the actual interest that could be obtained from the issuance of public bonds was often more than one percent. Therefore, the general banking industry and those with financial resources were very willing to invest in public bonds, and even used public bonds for speculation. This not only affected the national wealth, but also had a profound impact on industry and commerce. The profits from investing in industry and commerce may not be as high as those from public bonds. Now, the decision to issue public bonds can enable those with financial resources to be happy to invest in industry and commerce, and the economic turnover of industry and commerce will be better than before. Therefore, industry and commerce absolutely support the Ministry of Finance's issuance of new public bonds, he said.</p>
<h3>International Wireless Telephone: China and the UK Conduct Another Test Call</h3>
<p>The Result of the Test Call Was Clearer Sound Waves Than Before; China and Japan Will Have Fifteen Calls, and the Japanese Side Will Send Personnel to Negotiate, According to the New News Agency. The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is actively preparing for international wireless telephone. On Monday, another test call was held between Shanghai and London, and the results were quite good. China and Japan will begin communications on the 15th, and the Japanese Ministry of Communications has sent personnel to Shanghai to negotiate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>China and the UK Conduct Another Test Call</p>
<p>Since the completion of the Zhenru transmitter, the International Telecommunications Bureau has conducted test calls with Italy, the Philippines, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, and the results have been quite good. According to a New News reporter, the International Wireless Radio Station in the Sassoon Building on Renji Road used the terminal equipment installed at the Liu Hang newspaper office to conduct another test call with the London Radio Station in the United Kingdom at midnight on Monday night. They responded to each other for fifteen minutes, and the sound waves were clear. The result of the test call was better than before. It has now been decided to continue test calls with the United Kingdom twice a week to improve technical proficiency.</p>
<p>China and Japan Will Communicate in Half a Month</p>
<p>China and Japan will begin communications on the 15th of this month. The Japanese Ministry of Communications has sent Mr. Arakawa to Shanghai to negotiate. The future call fee has been set at 15 Japanese yen for the minimum call time of three minutes, and 5 Japanese yen for each additional minute (both parties use Japanese yen as the unit to avoid the trouble of converting French francs into Chinese and Japanese currency). It is also learned that before the official communication, the International Radio Station of our country will continue to conduct one more test call every Monday and Thursday, and the results are quite good.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Federation Again Presents to the Executive Yuan and Ministry: Please Order the Banking Industry to Implement Interest Rate Reductions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that Shanghai's industry and commerce are declining, and it is difficult for various industries to maintain. The central government has ordered the banking industry in Shanghai to reduce loan interest rates to relieve industry and commerce, but this has not been realized for many days. The regular meeting decided to present again to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the Shanghai banking industry be ordered to implement it as soon as possible to save the declining situation. The original memorial stated: "Early on, we presented a request to re-order the Shanghai banking industry to reduce loan interest rates and facilitate loan procedures in order to seek prosperity. We humbly believe that Shanghai's market is declining and industry and commerce are萧条(xiāo tiáo, desolate), and have reached the extreme. Companies and businesses are closing down every day. Since the government authorities implemented the currency system reform measures, the cost of raw materials in various industries has increased, and due to the weak purchasing power in the market, business has become even more depressed. Looking ahead, there are crises everywhere. Our federation once presented a request to transfer and order the banking industry to reduce loan interest rates, and we have been transferred to handle the case. However, to this day, we have not seen any implementation. Our federation is a group of citizens and has more insightful knowledge. The regular meeting decided to present again to Your Excellency, requesting a prompt implementation to provide relief, so as to save the declining situation. This matter concerns the relief of Shanghai's commerce. We sincerely hope that you will examine and handle it. We are extremely hopeful." Respectfully presented to President Chiang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>The Lumber and Charcoal Industry Decides: All Transactions Are in Cash</h3>
<p>During this year's business close, the collection of store accounts in the firewood and charcoal industry has not improved. It is believed that the reason is partly due to the sluggish market and partly due to the lack of consideration by the personnel in charge, resulting in arbitrary lending. If this continues, it is feared that it will affect business. In view of this, the industry association convened a meeting of managers of various firms on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to discuss and discuss the important business guidelines for this year. As a result, the management of store accounts was taken as the starting point, and the general purpose was to sell goods to stores in cash. At the very least, all accounts must be settled uniformly at the end of each month, otherwise, transactions will be stopped immediately to restrict them. All the agreed-upon measures are as follows: 1. Starting from February of this year, all goods will be sold in cash. Those with reliable credit may be allowed to open accounts, but they must be settled at the end of each month. 2. Stores must pay in legal currency (i.e., cash). If they have reliable credit, they may pay with checks, limited to one month after the sale of goods. No long-term payments will be accepted. 3. If a store's payment is not cleared by the end of the month, transactions should be stopped immediately. If an employee of the firm (i.e., a salesman) still extends credit, the person in charge must be responsible for compensating any losses, unless permitted by the manager. 4. If a store has not cleared its payment by the end of the month, the trade association may report it to the association in writing and issue a notice so that other firms can understand the contents and pay attention. The above four items are to be notified to the trade and implemented uniformly.</p>
<h3>The North German Company's Third Express Ship: Maiden Voyage Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arrived on Saturday… Anchored at Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf—Ship Name: Gneisenau—</p>
<p>Last year, the North German Company invested heavily in building three new giant ships to launch special express mail routes to the Far East. The first two ships that have arrived in Shanghai are the Scharnhorst and Potsdam. The third new ship, the Gneisenau, was originally scheduled to depart on December 5th last year, but was delayed by one month due to incomplete internal equipment and engineering. It was not until January 3rd of this year that it began its maiden voyage to the Far East from Bremen, Germany. Its route still goes to Hamburg, then to Antwerp in Belgium, then to Southampton in England, through Morocco, Spain, and then to Genoa, and then takes the Mediterranean route to China. This time, the maiden voyage brought 155 first-class passengers from Europe (40 to Shanghai), and the second-class cabins were also full. Yesterday, the North German Company received a telegram stating that the ship had departed from Little Luzon and would arrive in Hong Kong tonight, and would arrive in Shanghai on the 8th, still anchoring at Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf.</p>
<p>Ship Overview</p>
<p>The Gneisenau is a sister ship of the same type as the Scharnhorst and Potsdam. Its load capacity is 18,160 net tons, the ship is 652 feet long and 74 feet wide, with 152 first-class cabins and 144 second-class cabins. All the ship's engines are powered by electricity, so management, cleanliness, and hygiene are very convenient and perfect, which is a pioneering achievement in the Far East. The first-class rooms include a large dining room, social room, large living room, smoking room, wine bar, gym, women's room, chapel, etc., with magnificent and great equipment. The swimming pool is on the upper deck and can get sunlight. The layout of the second-class rooms is the same as the first-class. It can temporarily travel at 20 nautical miles per hour, and can be opened to 23 nautical miles when necessary. Shanghai to Genoa is still a 23-day sea journey.</p>
<p>Passenger Seats are Fully Booked</p>
<p>After the ship arrives in Shanghai on Saturday morning on the 8th, it should normally stay for two days for people to visit. However, because it has been delayed by two days on the way (originally scheduled to arrive on the 6th), the company may suspend the visit in order to catch up with the schedule and must sail to Yokohama and Kobe, Japan, on the 9th. Because on the 19th of this month, it must return to Germany on its maiden voyage from Shanghai, and the first and second-class passenger seats from Shanghai to Europe have long been fully booked. The good business is beyond the company's expectations, so the ticket prices have already increased. According to the company, most of the passenger seats on the Potsdam in June have been booked. After that, there will be a special express new ship sailing from Shanghai every four weeks.</p>

<h3>Telephone Committee Sends Letter to Taxpayers' Association: Convene a Taxpayers' Conference to Protest the Telephone Price Increase and Seek a Fundamental Cancellation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Telephone Problem Committee sent letters to the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, the Public Concession Western Taxpayers' Association, and the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, requesting that they quickly decide on a solution to the Special District telephone price increase. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, the Shanghai Telephone Company's disguised price increase plan has been announced and will be implemented from March 1st. At a time when industry and commerce are declining and all industries are萧条(xiāo tiáo, desolate), we are feeling unbearable burden. However, the company ignores the situation and insists on implementing it. Although various groups in the city have repeatedly expressed their opposition, they have not been adopted. The Board of Directors of the工部局(gōng bù jú, Municipal Council) also brazenly approved it. Once implemented, it will have a huge impact on the social economy. Your association is the supervisory body of the (Public Concession工部局(gōng bù jú, Municipal Council)) (French Concession公董局(gōng dǒng jú, Municipal Council)). We dare to ask you to convene a conference of Chinese (Western) taxpayer representatives in the district within the next few days to raise objections and seek a fundamental cancellation, so as to maintain the status quo. In addition to scheduling a joint meeting of representatives from various groups in the city to discuss countermeasures, our association is writing to you to clarify the situation and facilitate the process. This matter concerns the interests of taxpayers, so please do not ignore it. We are extremely hopeful."</p>
<h3>Further Records of Shipping Accidents</h3>
<p>The North Fú Runs Aground Again</p>
<p>The Northern Company's North Fú ship ran aground in the Yangtze River. After being rescued by a British warship and arriving empty in Jiujiang, it was slightly repaired and went to Hankou. However, yesterday the company in Shanghai received a telegram from the North Fú ship in Hankou stating that at 7:30 p.m. on the 3rd, the ship was about to dock in front of the Mitsubishi Wharf when it ran aground again. They are now trying to drag it away. Because it has arrived in Hankou, there is no major problem.</p>
<p>Ruikang is Being Rescued</p>
<p>The Shou Kang Company's Ruikang ship was surrounded by ice outside Dagu Port and could not move forward or backward. It was short of food and coal, and news was blocked. This was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the hull of the ship has been found to be leaking due to the abrasion of the solid ice, and water has entered the cabin. Yesterday, the Shou Kang Company was discussing rescue plans. A urgent telegram from Tianjin stated that they have tried to send the Dalian Maru or Zhonghua Maru ship to tow it away.</p>

Regarding the Ministry of Railways' appropriation of three-quarters of the funds to pay 5% interest, it was decided to entrust Committee Member Zong Jian to consult with the Ministry and make every effort to allocate the interest in accordance with the resolution of the Central Political Conference.

Regarding the Sino-Belgian Friendship Association's request for 20,000 yuan to build a clubhouse, it was decided to allocate 20,000 yuan from the Pinghan Road repayments, and Chairman Chu and Lang were entrusted to contact the Sino-French Friendship Association to add a floor to the association's clubhouse as the Sino-Belgian Friendship Association's clubhouse. (C) Temporary Motions: Committee Member Jin Shanshan requested that the Education Fund Committee's resolution to allocate 40,000 US dollars to the Midwifery Education Committee be implemented.

<p>Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee Chinese Delegation Work Report for the 24th Year</p>
<p>In March of the 24th year, the association met in the capital. The delegation re-elected members in accordance with the articles of association. Each of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Health sent one regular and one alternate member, with a term of five years. Chu Minyi was unanimously elected as Chairman and Zeng Zhongwu as Vice Chairman. At the same time, the Sino-Economic Education and Cultural Fund Committee and the Sino-Belgian Health Construction Fund Committee were also reorganized. Zeng Zhongwu was appointed as the convener of the Cultural Committee, and Jin Shanshan was appointed as the convener of the Health Committee. Chu Minyi and Zeng Zhongwu were elected as standing committee members. The work situation over the past year is summarized as follows: The Sino-Belgian Radium Institute was handled by the delegation with funds allocated from the Health Construction Fund. The Sino-Belgian Radium Institute has achieved results. This kind of radium medical treatment is still a pioneering effort in our country. It is the latest scientific treatment. Therefore, the delegation does not hesitate to spend huge sums of money every year to handle it. Because the previous contract with the Sacred Heart Hospital had some shortcomings, it has now been agreed by both parties to sign a new one. The personnel in charge of the hospital also resigned. Now, radium therapy experts are being hired from Belgium to come to China to achieve greater results. The University Thesis Awards: The association has discussed and decided to allocate 3,000 yuan to handle the University Thesis Awards. A trial run was held in the first phase of the 22nd year, and the results were quite good. The graduating students of various universities responded very enthusiastically. After organizing a detailed reading committee, the results were read in detail, and a total of 1,700 yuan was awarded. This year, the remaining funds will be used to continue the event. The questions have been compiled and distributed to various universities for publication. The Sino-Belgian Health Construction Fund Committee held its second meeting at the Executive Yuan on March 28th to discuss various proposals related to health. After reviewing each proposal, those that are related to the nature of Sino-Belgian industries and are permanent in nature will be subsidized. Committee Member Jin Shanshan also went to various places to accept the organs subsidized by the health fund of this association for field investigation and prepared a report to the association. The Sino-Belgian Culture and Education Fund Committee: Three-quarters of the association's funds, 3.75 million US dollars, are used for the Longhai Railway and other state-owned railways. The Central Political Conference decided to use this money as the Sino-Belgian Culture and Education Fund, with interest paid at 5%. The Ministry of Railways was also ordered by the Executive Yuan to allocate the funds. The delegation held its 13th meeting in the capital, and Committee Members Zong Jian and Duan Xipeng were entrusted to contact this matter. Committee Member now serves as Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways. Chairman Chu and Committee Member have repeatedly contacted the matter, and Committee Member表示(biǎo shì, expresses) that they will follow the principle of the Central Political Conference resolution and make every effort to allocate the interest. Pinghan Railway Lincheng Coal Mine Debt Case: Regarding the Pinghan Railway Lincheng Coal Mine debt case, after repeated letters from the delegation, the Lincheng Coal Mine said that it was in the shutdown period and had no money to repay. The Pinghan Railway only recently allocated more than 34,000 yuan in national currency. The association has returned the bonds and made an end. The funds are still kept by Chairman Chu and Committee Member in the Central Bank. Belgian Student Affairs: The Belgian student affairs this year will still be handled in accordance with the existing regulations. The scholarship method will be used to select outstanding Belgian students and subsidize them step by step by the principals of the universities where they are studying. The two students sent from China are Fan Xi and Zhao Luanzhang from the Sino-French National Institute of Technology. Both students are the champions of the graduates of the school. A list of the Belgian students who are subsidized by the association is listed below.</p>

<h3>The German Economic Investigation Mission Paid a Visit to Mayor Wu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dr. Ke Pu, the head of the German Far East Economic Investigation Mission, and members Rosenber等(děng, etc.), accompanied by Lang Shi, the German Consul in Shanghai, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government in the city center yesterday morning. Mayor Wu personally received them and talked for about 15 minutes before Dr. Ke Pu and others left.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Flew to Hankou Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Wang Zhengting, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central Committee, has been running around various places recently. After returning to Shanghai from Qingjing, he took the China Aviation Company's plane to Hankou from Shanghai at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. According to Wang's entourage, he is traveling for the affairs of the Kelly Liuhegou Coal Mine, which is publicly developed by the Central Company, and has no other official business.</p>
<h3>Wang's Cold is Improving; Doctors Firmly Advise Him Not to Receive Guests</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Wang Jingwei suffered a severe cold the day before yesterday (i.e., Yan Hulinsha). According to yesterday's news, it has been learned today that Wang's severe cold is improving, but his intervals are still frequent, and his vision is getting worse. Doctors firmly advise him not to receive guests or overwork himself.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Instructs: Reduction of Deed Tax Extended for Another Five Months</h3>
<p>The reduction of the deed tax on fields and houses in Shanghai County, which is reduced by six percent for sales and three percent for mortgages, expires at the end of January of this year. Now, the county government has received an order from the provincial government stating that from February, the tax rate for the deed tax on fields and houses was originally intended to revert to nine percent for sales and six percent for mortgages, and no further extension would be granted. However, there were partial droughts and floods in the north and south of Jiangsu Province last year, and the autumn harvest was not satisfactory. If the reduction period is not continued, people will inevitably wait and see each other, which is contrary to the purpose of enriching taxes and caring for the people. From February to the end of June, the extension period will be extended for another five months until the end of the 24th year, etc. County Magistrate Ye yesterday instructed all district offices and township offices to widely persuade and order that all untaxed deed papers be taxed, and to notify the public for universal knowledge.</p>
<h3>Industry Department Consults City Government for Detailed Investigation: Reasons for Delaying Company Registration</h3>
<p>In the future, there should be no delays or discrepancies in handling cases that require approval and transfer.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday received a communication No. 40003 from the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Based on the report submitted by accountant Xu Yongzuo on October 26th of the 24th year, stating that the registration cases he handled for various companies have not been approved for a long time. He earnestly requests that the approval date for company registration cases be determined to ensure the smooth implementation of government orders and benefit the merchants. Enclosed is a list of ten company registration cases that have not been approved. The Ministry believes that the company registration cases listed by the accountant were all forwarded by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Upon investigation, there were indeed delays in the forwarding time. For example, in the case of the establishment registration of Linhua Advertising Co., Ltd., the accountant stated that he was informed on July 12th that the bureau had forwarded the case, but the case was not forwarded to the Ministry until September 12th. In the case of the establishment registration of Jishi Shenchang Clock Co., Ltd., it was stated that approval was granted for forwarding on July 31st, but it was not forwarded until October 3rd. The date when the accountant received the approval for forwarding and the date when the bureau forwarded the case to the Ministry were more than two months apart. In the case of the establishment registration of Datong Chemical Industry Factory Co., Ltd. and the capital increase registration of Shangban Zhabei Water and Electricity Co., Ltd., the accountant stated that the approval for forwarding was granted on October 12th and 16th respectively, and half a month has passed, but they have not been forwarded yet. Other cases have been delayed by one or two months before being approved and forwarded. What is the actual situation? A copy of the report has been sent to order the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to investigate each case in detail and report back, and to expedite the approval and forwarding of the cases that have not been forwarded in accordance with the law. Two months have passed, and no reply has been received, making it impossible to handle the matter. Company registration cases should be forwarded promptly after approval by the competent authority and should not be delayed. Repeated orders have been issued to comply with this requirement, but the bureau still has delays. The original complainant complained to the Ministry, and the bureau failed to comply with the order to provide reasons for the delay, which is inappropriate. A copy of the accountant's original report is enclosed to request your municipal government to verify and order the bureau to comply with the Ministry's order, provide separate replies, and strictly order that all cases that need to be approved and forwarded in the future should be handled, approved, and submitted immediately upon arrival, without any delays or discrepancies." This is a matter of official friendship.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Silk Industry Federation Holds Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Yesterday</h3>
<p>A general meeting will be held in Hangzhou on the 23rd of this month, and Chen Jingxian and two others will be in charge of drafting the agenda.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Silk Industry Association Federation held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 3 PM yesterday at the Shanghai office of the Lianzhuli Residence on Aivenyi Road. Attendees included Chu Huiceng, Zhang Youyi, Jiang Laixian, Tang Yiru, and Chen Jingxian. Observers included Zhou Yangsong from Haiyan and Fu Mengliang from Jiashan, among others, totaling more than ten people. Chu Huiceng chaired the meeting. After the formalities, the chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting and incoming documents, and then discussed the proposals. Regarding the date of the general meeting, it was resolved to hold it at 1 PM on the 23rd of this month at the All-Province High Association Federation in Hangzhou. The Party and government organs will be reported to send personnel for guidance, and a public notice will be published in the newspaper. Regarding the agenda for the general meeting, it was resolved to appoint Chen Jingxian, Zhou Yangsong, Fu Mengliang, and two others to draft it. There were many other routine proposals discussed. The meeting adjourned at around 4 PM.</p>
<h3>Recent News on Disaster Relief from the China International Famine Relief Commission</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission, located at 505 Henan Road, has spared no effort in promoting and soliciting donations since launching its efforts to provide relief for the Jianghe River flood disaster last year. It has successively raised more than 170,000 yuan in relief funds and more than 30,000 pieces of relief clothing, all of which have been distributed to the disaster areas. Recently, it has allocated another 1,000 yuan in national currency to Pastor Ming Le Lin of the Presbyterian Church in Haizhou, Northern Jiangsu, for emergency relief, and allocated 3,000 yuan in national currency to repair the Anxi to Quanzhou highway in Fujian, providing work as relief, which is being handled by Mr. Luo Jie, the president of Xisi College in Quanzhou. According to people from the association, the disaster situation last year was extremely severe, and the disaster area was vast. Although relief efforts were carried out in many ways, the disaster victims were able to barely survive the winter. However, because their houses and seeds were completely destroyed, there were people everywhere who had no homes to return to and no land to cultivate. It is imperative to provide spring relief. It is hoped that philanthropists at home and abroad will generously donate to support this righteous cause.</p>
<h3>The China Children's Welfare Association Accepts Disaster-Stricken Children in Yanshi County</h3>
<p>Currently, a total of 225 disaster-stricken children have been accepted. Due to the severity of the disaster in Henan and the plight of the disaster-stricken children, the China Children's Welfare Association sent Zhao Jianchi, a staff member of the Guarantee Group, to Zhengzhou, Huaxian, Yanshi, and other places last year to inspect the situation of the disaster-stricken children. In addition to subsidizing the children's welfare homes in Zhengzhou and Huaxian to cover the cost of raising disaster-stricken children, it also raised 3,200 yuan to establish a temporary shelter for disaster-stricken children in Yanshi, with a quota of 200 children, for a period of four months, in order to seek appropriate and possible relief. It is now known that the disaster-stricken children's shelter in Yanshi began accepting children on the 16th of last month (January). Huang Zhenying, Wang Zihou, Zhang Puan, and others appointed by the Children's Welfare Association are in charge of everything in the shelter. In addition to providing the disaster-stricken children with appropriate care, they are also providing them with appropriate education. The progress is quite smooth. Currently, the shelter houses 169 boys and 56 girls, for a total of 225 children, which exceeds the original quota.</p>
<h3>The Municipal National Goods Annual Meeting Sends Letters to Major Companies to Promote Domestic Products, Scheduled Meeting to Discuss Work Outline</h3>
<p>The Municipal National Goods Year National Goods Movement Committee will hold its second plenary council meeting on the afternoon of the 11th of this month to discuss the work outline for this year and the plan for promoting domestic products. It has also sent letters to major department stores such as Wing On and Sincere, requesting them to instruct all store employees to vigorously promote domestic goods and display domestic product samples in the showcases to facilitate customers' selection. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Various Companies to Promote Domestic Goods</p>
<p>The Municipal National Goods Year Committee yesterday sent letters to Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, Lihua, and other department stores, stating: "To Whom It May Concern: This year's Municipal National Goods Year is a city-wide movement in Shanghai to promote domestic goods, punishing the bad and rewarding the good to develop the future of domestic goods. Your company has spared no effort in promoting domestic goods over the years. However, customers are accustomed to using foreign goods, and it is necessary to change their mentality. This can only be achieved through the efforts of store employees. The responsibility of sellers should be to correct the mentality of customers. The association has recently received reports from citizens stating that the samples displayed in the major showcases along the road by your company are still promoting imported goods. It should be known that the essence of consumerism lies in not understanding the origin of goods, and if sellers still do not regard promoting domestic goods as their duty, the crisis will be even greater. Therefore, we are writing to specifically instruct all store employees to vigorously promote domestic products from now on and correct the mentality of customers. As for the goods displayed in the showcases, please also prioritize domestic products. This matter concerns the future of domestic goods. We are writing to inform you and hope that you will handle it accordingly."</p>
<p>Scheduled Discussion of Work Outline</p>
<p>The association will hold a plenary council meeting on the 11th of this month to discuss the work outline for this year and the plan for promoting domestic goods. Yesterday, it issued a notice to the council members, requesting them to attend on time. The notice stated: "Notice: The association will hold its second council meeting at 3 PM on the 12th of this month to discuss the work outline for the 25th year and the plan for promoting domestic goods. Accordingly, we are issuing this notice, and we hope that you will attend on time to discuss the progress together. This is extremely important."</p>
<h3>The Paint and Woodware Guild Appeals for Worker Sun Zhenhua</h3>
<p>Sun Zhenhua (also known as Du Zai), a painter who works at Ma Xiangji Paint Shop on Jiujiang Road in the British Concession, is 31 years old and a native of Xiushui, Zhejiang. On January 20th of this year, after having dinner at the shop's New Year's Eve dinner, he left the shop to return home. While passing through Huajinli, Hu Peihuan, a student from Fudan University, was robbed of her handbag by bandits on the road and shouted for help. The painter, wearing a short coat, was mistaken for a thief by two Chinese detectives from the Central Police Station, who shot and killed him. The deceased's wife, Sun, appealed to the Municipal Paint and Woodware Guild for justice. The guild agreed to accept the case and wrote to the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association of Chinese Residents in the Concessions and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to provide assistance to achieve the goal of punishing the murderers and providing compensation. The letters to the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association of Chinese Residents in the Concessions, etc., are as follows: "Respectfully, we received a letter from Ma Xiangji Paint Shop, a member of our association, which stated: 'Sun Zhenhua (also known as Sun Du Zai), a painter at our shop, is a native of Xiushui, Zhejiang, 31 years old, and has been working at our shop for five years. On January 20th of this year (December 26th of the lunar calendar), after having the New Year's Eve dinner at the shop, he received his wages and left the shop to return home. While passing near Huajinli, bandits robbed Hu Peihuan, a student from Jiangwan Fudan University, of her handbag. Hu shouted for help, and two Chinese detectives, Nos. 164 and 2211, from the Central Police Station heard the alarm and rushed to catch the thieves. They mistakenly identified the painter Sun Zhenhua as a bandit and fired their guns, firing four shots, two of which pierced Sun's body, killing him instantly. The police then transported the body to the morgue for examination. At the time of the incident, a suspect named Ji Ziqing from Tongzhou was arrested by the police and sent to the Special Court No. 1 for trial on January 21st. The case has not yet been finalized. However, Sun Zhenhua, who had died, was shot and killed by the police. Because he was carrying nothing, it was impossible to ascertain his name and age on the spot. Sun's family (Sun's mother, Wang, and wife, Fei) came to the shop to inquire. After searching for a long time with the help of our shop, they finally got the real news on January 23rd. It was found that Sun Zhenhua was originally an apprentice at Cai Chunji Paint Shop. After graduating, he obtained a worker's license and a craft license No. 505 from the General Association of Paint Industry in June of the 15th year of the Republic of China. He has been working at our shop for five years. Because he is diligent and his skills are good, he receives a monthly salary of 24 yuan and a transportation allowance of 6 yuan. He has been living at No. 134 Shengshengli, Qianjiatang South, Huanlong Road, in the French Concession for many years. His mother, Sun Wang, is 60 years old, his wife, Sun Fei, is 28 years old, and he has two sons, Jin Gen, 9 years old, and Yin Gen, 6 years old, and a daughter named Yin Feng, who is still an infant. The entire family depends on Zhenhua's work for a living. Now, he has been unjustly killed, and the entire family is doomed. It is a pitiful and regrettable situation. Your association is a legitimate organization in our industry and should provide assistance. We ask that you seek justice for the painter and find a way to resolve the aftermath. Our shop is heartbroken and has limited ability. Therefore, we are writing to inform you of the facts and according to Sun Fei, who brought her children to the association and recounted the previous situation. After a detailed investigation by our association, the facts are as described above. Colleagues from the north and south have also come to the association, requesting the association to appeal to various public organizations for assistance in this case to achieve the goal of punishing the murderers and providing compensation to comfort the wronged soul. The association has a duty to protect its members and should appeal on their behalf. Although it is the duty of the police to catch thieves, human lives should not be treated as a game. Even if the Chinese detective mistakenly identified a passerby as a robber in the chaos, he should have fired a warning shot first in self-defense. After the first shot pierced the chest and back, how could he fire a second shot to kill him and silence him? The painter was walking on the road when he encountered the police catching thieves. He wanted to avoid them, but they mistook him for a suspect. He wanted to call for help, but bullets came immediately, taking his life on the road. The police have not investigated whether the deceased was a thief, whether he had any weapons at the time of his death, or whether the suspect Ji Ziqing had any relationship with the painter. The police ignored the family members who went to the Central Police Station to appeal for justice. They disregard Chinese lives as if they were no better than chickens and dogs. Moreover, the Chinese detective is also Chinese. We are all in danger. The deceased painter was only in his thirties, had excellent skills, and died a tragic death. He leaves behind an old mother, a young wife, and several children, all of whom are young. The family is in dire straits. The association believes that the murderers must be punished to comfort the wronged soul, and compensation must be provided to support the family. Your association is a leading organization of Chinese people in the Shanghai Concessions, helping the weak and clearing away the treacherous. We are writing to you to ask for your help in appealing to the British Municipal Council to punish the murderers and provide compensation for the painter Sun Zhenhua (also known as Sun Du Zai), who was wrongly accused of being a thief by a Chinese detective from the Central Police Station and shot to death. We also ask that you guarantee that the Chinese detectives will not repeat the same mistakes in the future, so that the deceased can have justice and the living will not be displaced. Not only will the members of the association be grateful, but all the workers in the city will also praise your virtues. We await your instructions." Addressed to the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association of Chinese Residents in the Concessions.</p>
<h3>Shenhu Inland River Joint Operation of Double Shifts</h3>
<p>The five shipping companies on the Shanghai-Huzhou (including Linghu New City) inland river route, including Zhao Shang, Yuantong, Lixing, Zhengchang, and Lixing, previously negotiated a joint operation through the mediation of the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Industry Association. The joint operation agreement and measures have been discussed repeatedly by the five companies and have now reached a compromise. The signing and implementation of the joint operation will take place soon. It is reported that Yuantong, Zhengchang, and Lixing, which operate on alternating days, have already implemented the joint operation on the 2nd of this month and have formed a joint office named Shenhu Line Double Shift Zhengyuanli Joint Operation Office. Once the five companies have successfully signed the agreement, a joint operation company will be formed. According to reliable sources in the inland river shipping industry, after this double shift cooperation on the Shenhu Line, the five companies' overall joint plan will be easier to implement. The current double shift three companies have stipulated that the passenger ship will depart at 11 AM every day and the cargo ship will depart at 2 PM, separating passenger and cargo transportation, making it convenient for both passengers and cargo transportation.</p>

<h3>Gu Zhuxuan and Wang Xinggao's Two Appeals: Both Scheduled for Sentencing at 2 PM on the 11th. Wang and Gu Both Firmly Deny Any Involvement in the Murder of Jia Peng. Zhao Guangfu's Testimony is Shifty and Evasive, Claiming He Never Went to the Asia Hotel.</h3>
<p>In the case of the assassination of Tang Jia Peng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, Wang Xinggao and Gu Zhuxuan were implicated as instigators. The police successively arrested and transferred them to the Special Second Court, which sentenced them to life imprisonment and fifteen years of imprisonment, respectively. Both convicts refused to accept the verdicts and separately filed appeals to the High Third Branch Court. After repeated hearings by the High Court, the case was deemed important and complex, requiring time for investigation, and therefore had not yet concluded. It was decided to conduct the hearings for both cases on the same day, yesterday, morning and afternoon. This has already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning around 9 AM, the High Third Branch Court, represented by acting presiding judge Sun Honglin, along with associate judges Wang Yue and Li Changnian, and clerk Wu Jiayu, convened a joint session with Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei in the First Tribunal.</p>
<p>Wang Xinggao's Appeal</p>
<p>The police department was represented by lawyer Gu Shouxi, and Wang's defense lawyers Ma Shouhua, Lin Dawen, and Wu Qilun also arrived on time. Only a few of Wang's family members and relatives were present in the audience. After the court session began, Wang Xinggao, the appellant, was ordered to come forward to state his reasons for the appeal, saying that when Tang Jia Peng was killed, he himself was working as a warden in the First Prison of Hubei Province, and was not in Shanghai, and had absolutely no involvement in instigating the murder. Because in the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928], when I was in the Investigation Team of the 26th Army in Zhabei, Zhao Guangfu, who was then called Zhao Debiao, committed a robbery, and I was ordered to arrest him, which</p>
<p>led to a grudge and false accusation.</p>
<p>He further stated that the rest of his testimony was the same as that given in the previous court hearings. Thereupon, the court ordered Zhao Guangfu to be brought to the court. According to Zhao's testimony, before the murder of Tang Jia Peng, he was met by Zhou Ermujiang at the Asia Hotel. There were many people there at that time. Zhou Ermujiang told me that there was Wang Jinkui, not Wang Xinggao. When we were preparing to accuse him (referring to Wang) in prison, three prominent lawyers, Xue Zhenyi, Zhu Jincheng, and a Mr. Shen, planned it. These three people are known as prominent lawyers, so the</p>
<p>planning and discussion</p>
<p>were very thorough. After the police received the accusation, they arrested him (referring to Wang). They (referring to Xue, Zhu, and Shen) originally wanted to extort money from him (referring to Wang), so in prison, I asked inmate Liu Guobao (who is a communist murderer and is currently appealing) to draft the accusation against Wang Xinggao. Liu refused to write it for me. In fact, Wang Xinggao and Wang Jinkui are two different people, etc. The court then ordered Liu Guobao to be brought to the court. After swearing as a witness, Liu testified that Zhao Guangfu had asked him to draft an accusation against Wang Xinggao, and he testified to me that he had a grudge against Wang Xinggao over a woman. He planned to change Wang Jinkui to Wang Xinggao, and</p>
<p>accuse him.</p>
<p>At that time, I told Zhao that I would not write it for him, etc. The court also summoned Wang Rusong, the detective in charge of this case, for questioning. Wang the detective said that in this case, there was indeed a person named Wang Jinkui. Wang the detective claimed that Zhao Guangfu had stated that Wang Jinkui was Wang Xinggao at that time. At this time, Wang Xinggao declared to the court that the case was not handled by Wang the detective, but by officer Guo Shaorong, who is present today. Guo was sent to arrest Wang Jinkui at the address, but he had already fled after hearing the news. Wang Jinkui really exists. The court then summoned Guo the detective, who claimed that he had indeed gone to arrest Wang Jinkui according to the address, but Wang Jinkui had already fled far away after hearing the news. At this point, the court considered the case</p>
<p>already clear</p>
<p>and ordered the opening of arguments. First, the prosecutor was asked to present his opinion. Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei then stated his opinion. The police department's lawyer, Gu Shouxi, argued that this case has been ongoing for over a year. The court has conducted a careful investigation and has investigated in detail Wang Xinggao's work history in Hankou. The accuser Zhao Guangfu's testimony is contradictory and evasive. He requested the presiding judge to render a verdict according to the law. Finally, the three lawyers hired by the appellant Wang Xinggao, Ma, Lin, and Wu, successively argued. The court then announced the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for 2 PM on the 11th. The appellants were returned to custody to await instructions. When the court adjourned, it was already 1:30 PM. As for</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan's Appeal</p>
<p>the court hearing was held yesterday afternoon. The police department and the court maintained the same strict security measures as before, sending detectives to patrol the area around the court and working with bailiffs to maintain order inside the court. Nearly a hundred of Gu's family members and relatives were present in the audience. At 2:40 PM, acting presiding judge Sun, along with associate judges Wang and Li, and the court clerk, convened a joint session in the First Tribunal with Chief Prosecutor Zhao to continue the hearing. The police department was represented by lawyer Yao Zhaodi. The appellant Gu Zhuxuan's defense lawyers Xue Dubi, Shan Yuhua, and Lou Ying also arrived on time. After the court session began, the court ordered to</p>
<p>bring Gu Zhuxuan</p>
<p>to the stand. Gu had a short mustache on his upper lip. First, he was asked about his age and place of birth. Gu stated that he was 51 years old, from Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, and lived in Yonghe Lane on North Xizang Road. He operated many businesses, such as glass factories, shipping companies, hotels, and theaters. The theaters have now been sold off. At this point, the court announced that the case was being reheard today and asked Gu, "You were sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights by the original trial court of the Second Special District for instigating murder. Do you refuse to accept this and file an appeal?" Gu answered yes. The court ordered him to state his</p>
<p>reasons for appeal.</p>
<p>Gu claimed, "I know nothing about this case. Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi are extorting money from me and falsely accusing me. I have no way to defend myself, and I cannot speak out. I have never met Zhao and Zhang and do not know them. I have never been to the Asia Hotel, and I have never walked on that road. I have no grudges against Tang Jia Peng. Why would I want to ask someone to kill him? I have been in Shanghai for over thirty years and have never committed any crimes. Now I am sick, so please let my lawyers present my case." The court asked, "Do you know Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui?" Gu answered, "I have never met them." The court asked, "Do you know Wang Xinggao?" Gu answered, "Yes, he is from the same hometown." The court asked, "Do you know Wang Jinkui?" Gu answered, "No, I do not know him." The court asked, "Was it Wang Xinggao who introduced Zhao and Zhang</p>
<p>to you?"</p>
<p>Gu answered, "That is not the case." The court asked, "Is Wang Xinggao your apprentice?" Gu answered, "No, please investigate. If there is any relationship, I am willing to accept severe punishment." The court asked, "According to Zhao and Zhang, Wang Xinggao introduced them to you at the Asia Hotel." Gu answered, "I have never been to the Asia Hotel." The court asked, "According to you, why would they (referring to Zhao and Zhang) accuse you?" Gu answered, "They want to ask me for money. I am sick in the hospital. My family told me about it." I have no grudges against Tang Jia Peng. Why would I kill him?" The court asked, "When did you receive the letter from Zhao Guangfu?" Gu answered, "It was around June or July of last year.</p>
<p>I received several letters."</p>
<p>Gu answered, "I do not remember clearly. My family received them. They have now been submitted to the court." The court asked, "Did you agree to give them money?" Gu answered, "They are in prison. I do not know how to send it in." The court asked, "Who delivered Zhao Guangfu's letters to you?" Gu answered, "I was in Puji Hospital. My family received them. To avoid bothering me, they did not tell me." The court asked, "Did you see the letters?" Gu answered, "I have never seen them. My family told me about them." The court asked, "According to Zhao's letter, you would have personally agreed to give him 10,000 yuan." Gu answered, "That is not the case." The court asked, "Did you see the letter from Xue Zhenyi?" Gu answered, "My family received it. Later, a relative told me that if there was such a thing, it would be better to</p>
<p>spend some money</p>
<p>to settle it. Because there was no such thing, I ignored it." The court asked, "Who is Zheng Jian San?" Gu answered, "He is a relative." The court asked, "Did Zheng Jian San also receive a letter from Xue?" Gu answered, "I was in the hospital at that time." The court asked, "What is your relationship with Xue Zhenyi?" Gu answered, "During the January 28th Incident [Shanghai War of 1932], I ran a refugee camp, and he was in the ambulance team. I did not know him before." The court asked, "Zhao Guangfu said that you asked lawyer Zhu Dianqing to meet with him before his case was finalized." Gu answered, "That is not the case." The court asked, "Do you have a relationship with Zhu Dianqing?" Gu answered, "He is also from Yancheng. There is no relationship. Now</p>
<p>Zhu is in Shanghai.</p>
<p>You can summon him for questioning." The court asked, "How long have you known Tang Jia Peng?" Gu answered, "He has been in Shanghai for twenty or thirty years. I have known him for about seven or eight years." The court asked, "Is Tang the manager of the Great World?" Gu answered, "No, someone else is in charge. But I do not know the details." The court asked, "According to you, you have no grudges against Tang?" Gu answered, "Tang and I neither worked together nor shared wealth. How could there be any grudges?" The court asked, "Then Tang Jia Peng's sister, Tang Youmei, previously reported to the case that her brother had an accident, and that you were the one who harmed him. What is going on?" Gu answered, "Tang has a wife, brothers, and sisters. If I had killed Tang Jia Peng, they would have sued me long ago. Why would they wait until Tang Youmei saw the</p>
<p>news in the Evening News</p>
<p>before reporting it?" The court asked, "Do you know Zheng Rongsheng?" Gu answered, "I know him. He runs a fruit stall in my theater and still does today." The court asked, "When was Zheng Rongsheng killed?" Gu answered, "Yes, in the same year as Tang, before Tang died." The court asked, "Do you know who killed Zheng Rongsheng?" Gu answered, "I do not know." The court asked, "Do you know Zheng Rongsheng's wife, Chen Alin?" Gu answered, "I know her." The court asked, "After your case happened, the police received a letter saying that after Zheng Rongsheng died, you went to his house and took some money, saying it was for killing Tang Jia Peng." Gu answered, "I have never been to Zheng's house. Where he lives,</p>
<p>how many people are in his family,</p>
<p>I do not know." The court asked, "Do you still owe Zheng Rongsheng 17,000 yuan? Is that correct?" Gu answered, "This amount is the deposit for the stage in the Great Theater, deposited with me. 15,000 has already been returned. 5,000 is my promissory note, which can be verified with the bank's stub. After Zheng died, the remaining amount was withdrawn by someone else. The note was not recovered because his family said they could not find it after Zheng died." The court asked, "Did Zheng's wife come to your house after her husband died?" Gu answered, "She came. The woman just cried and wanted to continue doing business. I allowed her to." The court asked, "Did Zheng's wife ever say anything about revenge to you?" Gu answered, "She did not say anything." The court asked, "The Taoist Xu Fubao,</p>
<p>do you know him?</p>
<p>Where is he now?" Gu answered, "I know him. I do not know where he is." The court asked, "Do you also know Chou Wanrong?" Gu answered, "I know him too." The court asked, "The letter said that after you, Xu Fubao, and Chou Wanrong took the money from Zheng's house, you threatened Zheng's wife not to report it. Is this true?" Gu answered, "There is no such thing." The court asked, "You said you are sick. What kind of illness do you have?" Gu answered, "Stomach problems, frequent occurrences, feeling uncomfortable all over. I was the head of the defense regiment. At the end of March and the beginning of April last year, I went to the municipal government for a meeting and was hit by a car, injuring my brain." The court asked, "Did you go to Hangzhou last spring?" Gu answered, "I go to Hangzhou from time to time. I have not been there for a year." At this point, the court ordered to</p>
<p>bring Zhao Guangfu</p>
<p>to the stand. Gu's defense lawyer, Lawyer Xue, requested the court to allow Gu Zhuxuan to sit down while waiting for questioning because he was sick and had been standing for a long time. The court approved the request. The court said to Zhao, "Today, you are brought here as a witness for Gu Zhuxuan's case. You are the one who accused Gu. Your previous statements in the original trial and to the police are inconsistent. Today, you must tell the truth and speak from your conscience. You cannot lie. When you killed Tang Jia Peng, was Gu Zhuxuan present?" Zhao answered, "This matter cannot</p>
<p>be spoken of from the conscience.</p>
<p>You have to ask the prison lawyer Xue Zhenyi to know the truth." The court asked, "Was Gu actually there?" Zhao answered, "He was not there at first, but he initiated it later. Everyone in the prison knows about this." The court asked, "Did Gu actually meet you at the Asia Hotel?" Zhao answered, "According to Zhou Ermujiang, he met Gu at the Asia Hotel." The court asked, "What exactly do you mean by initiating it later? Why didn't you say that Gu was there before?" Zhao answered, "I originally didn't know before, but I found out later. After the first trial, when I was asked who instigated the murder of Tang, I only said it was instigated by</p>
<p>Zhou Ermujiang."</p>
<p>The court asked, "Since you didn't know that Gu was there before, did you accuse him because of a grudge against Gu?" Zhao answered, "There is no grudge. Please summon the prison lawyer Xue Zhenyi for questioning, and you will understand." The court ordered Zhao to give a detailed account of what happened. Zhao said, "After I was sentenced to life imprisonment, Xue said to me that he had a plan and told me to say that Gu asked lawyer Zhu Dianqing to meet with me to appeal for me. Now Xue is turning against me, and I have to tell the truth. Xue told me that after Gu's matter was settled, he wanted to explain it to get out and asked me to send him a suit worth over a hundred yuan. He also said that he was Gu's apprentice because he was in trouble with the law, and Gu never came to see him, which caused</p>
<p>resentment and displeasure.</p>
<p>He came up with this method. Later, the police took Xue away and locked him up for more than ten days. He was unhappy with me and scolded me for asking him to be a witness in the police station instead of in court. Xue also told me to say that I had met Gu at the Da Jiangnan Hotel and the Asia Hotel, according to the verdict, but in fact, I never met Gu. There was also another lawyer in the prison called Zhu Jincheng, who also told me to say the same thing and asked me to send him a serge overcoat, leather shoes, and other items in the future. The rest of his answers were irrelevant and evasive." The court presented Xue Zhenyi with a note written by Zhao in pencil that</p>
<p>was given to Zhao to read.</p>
<p>The court asked, "Did you write this?" After Zhao read it, he answered, "I did not write this." The court said, "You entrusted Zhang Chenglian to give this note to Xue. The court has determined that you wrote it." Zhao still claimed that he did not write it. The court also showed Zhao a letter and asked, "You gave this letter to your family to forward. Did you write it?" After reading it, Zhao said, "I cannot write so well." The court asked, "You said Xue came up with the idea for you. According to this letter, it was your own idea." Zhao answered, "Xue said it was very good before. I don't know why he is like this now." The court asked, "According to the note, you saw</p>
<p>Gu's photo</p>
<p>in the Oriental Magazine and recognized him at first glance. Is there an Oriental Magazine in the prison?" The court asked, "On a piece of paper that the police found on you before, there were the names of Gu Zhuxuan, Gu Yuebo, Wang Xinggao, and twelve other people. Are you going to accuse all these people?" Zhao answered, "Xue Zhenyi knew them. He said to do it one by one." The court asked, "Is the person you testified about in Wang Xinggao's case also the one who came up with the idea for you?" Zhao answered, "Zhang Wenbing provided the testimony, only related to the case of accusing Wang Xinggao." The court asked, "Why didn't you mention Gu Zhuxuan in your own first trial?" Zhao answered, "We hadn't planned it yet." The court asked, "When you accused Wang Xinggao, did you already plan to</p>
<p>extort money</p>
<p>from Gu then?" Zhao answered, "Xue Zhenyi and Zhu Jincheng advocated it. The two of them even had disagreements about this matter." The court asked, "Did you come up with the idea to accuse Gu Zhuxuan yourself?" Zhao answered, "They (referring to Xue) told me to say that they first arrested him (referring to Gu) in the police station." Gu's defense lawyer asked the court to ask Zhao Guangfu if he had ever been to the Asia Hotel. The court asked Zhao, "Are you saying that you cannot speak from your conscience? You have only met Gu Dunyang, Zhang Xiaosizi, and others at the Bangbei Tigao Stove. You have never been to the Asia Hotel." At this point, Yu brought Xue Zhenyi to the stand and ordered him to swear as a witness and</p>
<p>tell the truth.</p>
<p>Xue testified that in April of last year, Zhao told me that he wanted to ask Gu Zhuxuan for some money so that he would not accuse him. I wrote two letters to Gu based on his intention to persuade him to reconcile. There was no such thing as Zhu Dianqing meeting with him. Zhao also told me that he recognized Gu Zhuxuan from the Oriental Magazine. In July of last year, Zhao asked someone to bring me a note, asking me to be a witness and promising to split the money three-seven after the matter was settled. I did not come up with the idea for Zhao. When the police took me away, they locked Zhao and Zhang Xiaosizi in the same room. Zhao</p>
<p>taught Zhang every day</p>
<p>how to accuse Gu Zhuxuan. Zhao's note was brought to me by inmate Zhang Chenglian." The court ordered Zhang Chenglian to be brought to the stand and ordered him to swear as a witness. According to Zhang's testimony, Zhao lived on the fourth floor in prison, Xue worked in the box room, and I worked as a sweeper. In July, on Sunday, Zhao was released to get a haircut and wrapped a note in a paper package and asked me to hand it over to Xue Zhenyi. I did not open it and did not know what it said." The court ordered Zhang Tinggui to be brought to the stand, ordered him to swear as a witness, and instructed Zhang, "You are sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment and are a witness. You must tell the truth. If you lie, you will</p>
<p>be punished."</p>
<p>Zhang said yes. According to Zhang's testimony, Zhao told me in prison that he had a relationship with Gu and asked me to accuse him of killing Tang Jia Peng. Wang Jinkui asked me to go. I did not see Gu at the Asia Hotel. Wang Jinkui told me that the person who just left was the fourth boss, but he did not say the last name Gu." The court also brought Wang Xinggao to the stand to testify that he had no relationship with Gu Zhuxuan and was not his student. He also did not know Zhang Tinggui. Zhao Guangfu knew that his other name was Zhao Debiao, but he did not know him." The court also asked Gu Zhuxuan, "What do you have to say about the testimony of the people in the case?" Gu testified, "I have no knowledge of this murder and have never met them. I have never been to</p>
<p>the Asia Hotel.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have two bodyguards and a car when I go out. If I had, I would not be able to deny it. Please investigate carefully." The court also asked Zhao Guangfu if he knew Gu's address and car number. Zhao answered, "Gu lives in several places. I asked friends who met with him to inquire. I know Gu's car number is 337." The court asked Gu, "Is your car number 337?" Gu answered, "It has been 337 for many years." At this point, the court considered the investigation to be complete and first asked the prosecutor to present his arguments, stating briefly that the handwriting of the accusation letter and the anonymous letter from a third party</p>
<p>were similar, which was quite suspicious. Please, the presiding judge,</p>
<p>render a verdict according to the law.</p>
<p>The court then ordered the opening of arguments. The police department's lawyer and the three defense lawyers for the appellant then engaged in eloquent arguments for a considerable time before concluding. The court ordered the announcement of the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for 2 PM on the 11th. The appellants were returned to custody separately to await instructions. When the court adjourned, it was already 7:40 PM. The sensational case has temporarily come to an end, awaiting the verdict.</p>
<h3>This City's Movement to Liberate Slave Girls: Registration to Begin Next Month. The Public Security Bureau to Complete Preparations This Month. Those Who Resist Liberation Will Be Punished According to the Law.</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau has recently received instructions from the Municipal Government to prepare for the registration of slave girls in this city. The bureau believes that the liberation of orphaned and helpless girls is extremely important for international credibility, humanitarian principles, and legal norms. It is currently actively preparing for this and has ordered the director of the Relief Section, Guanzhi, to expedite the handling of this matter. According to Mr. Gu, the director of the Police Department attaches great importance to this, so all the preparatory work for this section can be completed by the end of this month, and registration can begin on the first day of next month. It is also planned to announce the investigation period to the public and to supervise the subordinate units to investigate the number of slave girls and register them in a list. The investigation period is four months and may be extended by two months if necessary. The registration method has also been determined. All those who keep slave girls during the investigation period should apply to the bureau for registration or have someone else do it on their behalf. Slave girls who have been registered will be unconditionally liberated and restored to freedom. If they are minors without a home to return to, or if their families are unable to support them after returning home, they should be sent to the city's relief home or other charitable organizations for placement. Slave girls who are sixteen years old or older and have no home to return to may be matched with a spouse with their consent. Slave girls who have been liberated and have no family or whose family location is unknown may have the head of the local relief home or other charitable organization appointed as their guardian. Those who keep slave girls beyond the prescribed deadline and do not apply for registration may be fined up to ten yuan and ordered to complete the registration. The fines from the preceding paragraph will be used to expand the funding for the city's relief homes or other charitable organizations. Those who keep slave girls who have been registered and refuse to liberate them will be sent to the city's judicial authorities for handling according to the law. Slave girls who have been liberated and are of legal age may, if both parties wish to change the relationship to employment, have their wages determined in accordance with the city's living conditions.</p>
<p>Reimers and Blanc's Appeal</p>
<p>Reimers and Blanc were convicted of embezzlement and fraud. Chief Judge Helmick of the United States Court for China sentenced them to five years and two years of imprisonment, respectively. Yesterday before noon, their lawyer, Franke Ring, declared to the court that they would appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and presented seven reasons for the appeal. Because the two men have been convicted, their previous bail bonds are naturally invalid. Therefore, the matter of bail is also involved. This matter will be decided by the chief judge within one or two days. It is known that the sentences of Reimers and Blanc have been suspended for two years and three years and one year, respectively.</p>

<h3>The Murderer of a Young Woman Sends Another Letter: Over a Thousand Words in Tiny Script, Claiming Jealousy and Revenge for Unrequited Love</h3>
<p>On the first of this month, in room number 54 of the Anshang Hotel at 37 Baliao Bridge Street in the French Concession, a young married woman named Zhu, a guest at the hotel, was murdered by a man who identified himself as Zhao Junming. The murderer left a letter and fled, and the crime was discovered by a tea server named Chen Jinyu. He reported it to the French police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the coroner's office for examination. The Second Special District Court sent officials to confirm the death. Because no relatives came to identify the body, it was entrusted to the Tongren Fuyuantang for preparation and burial. The French police issued orders to all detectives to investigate and apprehend the fugitive murderer. The gist of the murderer's letter was reported in this newspaper three times already. It is now learned that the Anshang Hotel received another letter from the murderer, delivered by the post office, at 6 PM on the afternoon of the third. Upon opening the letter, it was found to contain ten sheets of scattered paper, filled with over a thousand words in tiny script, detailing his relationship with the deceased and his feelings of anger that led him to lure and kill her in revenge. The main points are similar to the previous letter, but this one also includes details of his relationship and love with the deceased. He had intended to marry her and had even initiated divorce proceedings with his own wife. However, after the lawsuit was settled and the divorce finalized, the deceased became unfaithful and found a new lover, refusing to marry him. This not only cost him several thousand dollars but also left him feeling despondent and without any interest in life. Therefore, he lured and killed her in revenge. He claimed to have seen through the world and intended to retreat to the mountains to cultivate his spirituality. He also instructed the hotel to dress the deceased in her clothes and asked them to sell her two gold rings to purchase a simple coffin for her burial. He warned that if they did not comply with his instructions or if anyone tried to profit from the situation, they would be treated in the same way as the deceased. He also mentioned that the deceased's new lover was currently in Wuxi. After reading the letter, the hotel accountant immediately sent it to the French police for investigation. Furthermore, in his previous letter, the murderer stated that the deceased's real name was Zhang Fuying. It is now learned that the police found a gold ring among the deceased's belongings with the name "Fuying" engraved on it, while the other ring was made of copper. Based on this, it is believed that the deceased's name was indeed Zhang Fuying, and it is likely that she was from Wuxi. The police have already inventoried the deceased's belongings, including her clothes and gold rings, and sent them to the court archives the day before yesterday to await identification by her relatives.</p>
<h3>A Gambling Dispute Leads to Murder in Sanlintang, Pudong: Gangsters Demand Extortion Money, Then Seek Revenge with a Mob, Killing a Teahouse Patron Named Cao Genfa</h3>
<p>—The Teahouse Owner’s Daughter is Unjustly Injured—</p>
<p>In a teahouse opened by Chen Zhanglin in Tianhua'an Township, east of Sanlintang, Pudong, illegal gambling had been taking place since the beginning of the lunar new year, with high spirits and significant winnings and losses. On the seventh day of the lunar new year, a gangster from Zhoupu Township suddenly arrived at the teahouse and attempted to extort money from Chen Zhanglin, who refused. Enraged and humiliated, the gangster forcibly seized money from the gambling table. Chen, seeing this, became furious and shouted for help. The gamblers rushed forward and beat the gangster. Realizing he was outnumbered, the gangster fled in a disheveled state. However, he remained bitter after being beaten and gathered forty to fifty of his cronies a few days ago to seek revenge. They took a small train to the east station of Tianhua'an, armed with axes, iron rulers, and other weapons. They stormed into the teahouse and attacked anyone they encountered, destroying everything in sight. Fortunately, Chen Zhanglin had heard rumors and had already hidden himself, avoiding harm. However, Cao Genfa, a patron (37 years old, a native of the area, residing in Caojiazhai, about three li northeast of Tianhua'an, and a sawyer by trade), was caught in the chaos and was struck in the head by an axe, causing him to bleed profusely. The other patrons scattered and fled. Frustrated that they had not found Chen Zhanglin, the gang left in a hurry. They then encountered Wang, the 25-year-old daughter of the teahouse owner, and, suspecting she was related to Chen Zhanglin, they also struck her in the left shoulder with an axe. The gangsters then left on the small train. Afterwards, Wang was taken to the Sanlintang Hospital for treatment. Cao Genfa was helped home, but his injuries were too severe, and he died the next day. The local bailiff reported the incident to the local court prosecutor's office, requesting an autopsy. The court, upon receiving the report, dispatched Prosecutor Lei Binzhang and Coroner Shen Qixiu across the river yesterday morning to Cao's residence. They confirmed that the deceased, Cao Genfa, had suffered numerous axe wounds to the head, damaging his skull, which was the cause of death. A coroner's report was filled out, and the widow and others filed a case, requesting justice. The judge agreed to apprehend the murderers and investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>A Strangled Female Corpse Discovered in a Field on Huangxing Road: Body Moved and Abandoned After Death, Small Round Mirror Found Nearby</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a female corpse, strangled to death, was discovered in a field near Huangxing Road in Yinxianggang. The local bailiff, Lu Guisheng, reported it to the local court prosecutor's office, requesting an examination. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Li Fen and Coroner Shen arrived at the scene. They determined that the female corpse was approximately 30 years old. She was wearing a gray silk cheongsam, lined with a black cloth jacket and trousers, black cloth shoes, and gray cotton socks. Her hair was cut short. A small round mirror and several copper coins were found near her. A gray cloth leg binding was wrapped around her neck, indicating that she had been strangled. It was observed that the silk fabric on the back of her cheongsam, around the buttocks, was completely torn, suggesting that she had been murdered elsewhere and her body dragged and abandoned there, causing the damage to her clothing. Since no family members came forward to identify her, it was ordered that the body be taken to the Shantang (a charitable organization) for preparation and burial. The small round mirror was taken back to the archives for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>The Liquidator of the Guang Sheng Li Leather Factory Discovers Altered Accounting Books: Suspected of Destroying Evidence, Additional Security Deposit of 10,000 Yuan Required</h3>
<p>The Guang Sheng Li Leather Factory, located at 368 Tiantong Road, declared liquidation in June of the 21st year of the Republic (1932) due to the impact of the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Guangdong native Deng Zhongze and lawyer Wang Siji were appointed to establish a liquidation office at 10 Daqing Li, Nanjing Road (Deng's residence). Deng was accused by shareholder He Jinlin in a report from lawyer Wang, filed on December 31st of last year, of embezzling a significant amount of funds. The most obvious instance was the embezzlement of 4,500 yuan. On January 27th of this year, the Hongkou Police Department was notified and dispatched Chinese Detective Zhu Jihuang to secretly apprehend Deng at his address and escort him to the First Special District Court for questioning. Details of the interrogation have been reported in this newspaper. Deng provided a security deposit of 10,000 yuan, and the police department investigated the factory's accounting books and scheduled another hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Bianfen continued the hearing at the Third Criminal Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that examining the factory's various accounting books during the adjournment had been difficult. The defendant had used evasive language and claimed to be mentally fatigued to the police. The accuser's side questioned Song Zhenchu, the accountant of the liquidation office, who testified that Deng had instructed him to transcribe two new sets of accounting books at the end of last month, transferring all expenses and other costs from one ledger. These items were not recorded in the old books, which Deng then hid. It has now been discovered that Deng embezzled over 20,000 yuan, possibly more, and a detailed investigation is still required. The defendant intentionally destroyed evidence, which is a serious offense. A further adjournment and an increased security deposit were requested, and it was requested that the defendant not be allowed to leave Shanghai. The two new accounting books were presented for inspection. Accountant Song Zhenchu then testified about Deng's instructions to transcribe the two new accounting books.

<h3>New Silver-Nickel-Copper Subsidiary Coins to Circulate on March 1st: Simultaneously Used in Cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, New Coin Fineness Already Extracted and Chemically Tested</h3>
<p>In order to unify the value of subsidiary coins, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Central Mint to begin minting new silver-nickel-copper subsidiary coins at the end of last year. By the end of last month, a large number of coins had been accumulated, totaling tens of millions. To ensure that the coins met the fineness standards of the new subsidiary coin law, the mint had Chemical Tester Ge Laide extract and chemically test the coins in accordance with the fineness standards issued by the Ministry of Finance. According to inquiries from a Xin Xin News Agency reporter, the Ministry of Finance has determined that the coins are urgently needed in various regions and has decided to begin circulating them on March 1st. It has also been decided to first distribute them to the central bank branches in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui for exchange. At that time, the Ministry of Finance will issue a public announcement. After the second batch of coins is minted in larger quantities, they will be distributed to other provinces for circulation. The reorganization and reminting of old subsidiary coins such as silver dimes and copper coins will be decided by the Subsidiary Coin Committee after further study.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur Accused of Secretly Selling Narcotics: Conflicting Testimony, Court Adjourns for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Li Kuiyuan, a native of Qingjiang who works as a chauffeur, was stopped by Chinese detective Xu Dezhong from the Laozha Police Department and Chinese and Western police officers at the intersection of Guangxi Road and Jiujiang Road at 10:45 PM on the 27th of last month. A packet of heroin was found in his car. He stated that the heroin belonged to Wang Yongqing, his landlord at number 9 Wujialong, Huanlong Road, who asked him to sell it. He was taken into custody by the First Special District Court. On the 28th of last month, Wang Yongqing suddenly surrendered himself to the Laozha Police Department, stating that according to Li Kuiyuan's wife, the heroin was found by their employed maid, Qiaoyun, and that Li was falsely accusing him. After investigation, the detectives determined that Wang's statement was untrue and summoned Wang to the police department for detention a few days ago. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the criminal court of the First Special District Court. The police department lawyer Chen Ming presented the case, stating that Li's wife, Yang, and the maid, Qiaoyun, were both present in court today and requested to be questioned. Judge Qian Hongye questioned Li Yang, Qiaoyun, Li Kuiyuan, and Wang Yongqing separately. Li Yang and Qiaoyun's testimonies were contradictory. They claimed both that Qiaoyun had found the heroin and that Wang Yongqing had instructed them to make that statement in order to exonerate himself. Li Kuiyuan insisted that Wang had asked him to sell it. Wang claimed that Li was falsely accusing him and that he had been working at the Hongen Hospital on Daxi Road for over ten years, had always been law-abiding, and would never do anything illegal. The police department's lawyer Wang stated that the car owner urgently needed the car, so the police department had approved a temporary loan and requested approval to return it. Judge Qian reviewed the testimonies and adjourned the case for sentencing. The two defendants were returned to custody. The outcome was very uncertain.</p>

<h3>Wanted by the Court on Charges of Fraud and Damaging Creditor's Rights: Lingering Deposit Disputes with the Jinxing Real Estate Company, Defendant Cannot Be Summoned, Trial Suspended</h3>
<p>Sun Chunsheng, the owner of the Jinxing Real Estate Company at 505 Henan Road, previously mortgaged 7 mu, 8 fen, 1 li, and 5 hao of land, along with buildings, at the Baokang Li base at the corner of Zhejiang Road and Beijing Road to the Hongsheng Fuji Money Exchange for 1.18 million yuan. A contract was signed stipulating that all rental income from the mortgaged property would be assigned to the Hongsheng Exchange from March 1st of last year and that no other lease agreements could be privately entered into. However, Sun failed to comply with the agreement, and the exchange sent a letter of demand on April 9th, which Sun did not contest. The exchange then filed a lawsuit to compel the assignment of rental income, and the First Special District Court and the Second Branch of the High Court both ruled in favor of the exchange. The Hongsheng Exchange obtained permission for provisional execution, but just as enforcement was about to begin, Sun colluded with the British Yexing Company, claiming that all rental income, amounting to approximately half of the actual rental income, had been leased to the company. Yexing then engaged the Murakami Law Firm to obstruct the execution. Hongsheng Exchange, believing that Sun was attempting to damage creditor's rights, engaged lawyers Cai Liuheng and Dong Chi to file a complaint with the criminal court of the First Special District Court, accusing Sun of fraud and damaging creditor's rights under Articles 356 and 339 of the Criminal Code, and requesting that he be punished accordingly. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao of the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court opened the trial for questioning. However, the address listed for Sun Chunsheng by the plaintiff was 325 Huade Road, the intersection of Dalian Bay Road. Since the house had already been sealed by the court, the summons could not be delivered. The plaintiff's attorney stated that, apart from this address, the defendant's whereabouts were unknown. Judge Ye then ordered the trial to be suspended and a warrant issued for the arrest of the defendant Sun Chunsheng.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Railways Award the Great China Double Coin Brand Automobile Tires</h3>
<p>The Great China Rubber Factory was founded in the 17th year of the Republic (1928) and specializes in the manufacture of rubber boots and shoes and various rubber products. It has a total of eight factories and branches, with distribution offices in Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Wuhu, and Wenzhou. It employs approximately 3,000 workers. Daily output is limited to boots and shoes, with as many as 40,000 to 50,000 pairs produced. The majority of domestic military and police personnel use these products, so imported rubber shoes are now almost absent from the market. Recognizing the progress of domestic transportation construction, the factory has also focused on the manufacture of various vehicle tires. Automobile inner and outer tires, rickshaw inner and outer tires, and bicycle inner and outer tires were first shipped two years ago. Recently, the Ministry of Industry notified the factory that, because the factory's manufacture of automobile tires is the only domestic imitation of transportation equipment, it has been granted exclusive manufacturing rights in the Shanghai area for five years. The Ministry of Finance has approved an exemption from transit duties for three years, effective from February 1st. The Ministry of Railways has approved a reduction of one grade, to the third grade, for automobile tires in the newly added category 29 (industrial arts) of the freight classification table, for a period of two years. Recently, the Northwest National Railway Bureau, the Fujian Provincial Automobile Management Office, the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, the Transportation Corps, the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company, the Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company, and the Hutai Long-Distance Bus Company have all placed orders, as the factory's products are effective, safe, and comparable to the best imported products. If all highways and automobile companies can adopt these products, the government and the people will provide strong support for them, recovering a significant amount of lost revenue. In the future, this will also greatly assist in transportation and national defense.</p>

<h3>Only One Silk Factory Currently Operating in This City</h3>
<p>Most Factories Cannot Operate Due to Lack of Raw Materials</p>
<p>Silk Improvement Association Purchases Silkworm Eggs to Increase Production</p>
<p>Of the silk factories in this city, only one has resumed operations since the total accounting at the end of the lunar year. Two or three more are expected to resume operations in the coming days. In order to find ways to increase the production of silkworm cocoons, the Sericulture Improvement Committee of the National Economic Council has purchased a large number of silkworm eggs from Italy and Japan and transported them to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for distribution to silkworm farmers. Details are as follows, according to inquiries from a Dagong She reporter:</p>
<h3>Only One Silk Factory Operating</h3>
<p>Since the autumn of last year, a total of 43 silk factories in this city have been operating. However, due to a shortage of raw materials, they successively ceased operations only six months later. At the time of the total accounting for the 24th year of the Republic (1935), nine factories were still in operation, but all ceased operations during the closing period. As of yesterday, only the Jiyu Silk Factory on Gonghe Road has announced that it will resume operations. All other districts, such as Zhabei, Hunan, and Hongkou, have not resumed operations. A Dagong She reporter learned yesterday from the silk industry that the main reason why the silk factories cannot resume operations is the lack of raw materials. However, the Dongyi Factory in the Zhabei district, the Fulun Factory in the Hongkou district, and the Yihe Factory in the French Concession are expected to resume operations in the coming weeks. Other factories will only be able to resume operations in June, when spring silkworms appear on the market. Therefore, the maximum number of silk factories in this city that will resume operations in the spring is only four or five.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Silkworm Eggs for Distribution and Cultivation</h3>
<p>Because last year, all of the silk factories felt the lack of raw materials and successively stopped operations, the Sericulture Improvement Committee of the National Economic Council specially sent personnel to Italy and Japan in December of last year to purchase a large number of silkworm eggs for distribution to silkworm farmers in preparation for silkworm breeding when the spring silkworm season arrives. It is learned that 70,000 sheets of Japanese silkworm eggs have been purchased in Kobe and Osaka, totaling 700,000 grams. The brand names are "Hua Liu × Hua Gui" and "Hua Gui × Hua Liu". The price of each sheet, including transportation costs, is 8 jiao. However, in order to promote silkworm breeding among farmers, they are sold to farmers for 4 jiao per sheet. Italian silkworm eggs will also be transported to China in the coming days and then distributed by the committee to silkworm farmers in the two provinces for cultivation.</p>

<h3>The Activity of Shanghai's Traditional Chinese Medicine Community After the Promulgation of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Ordinance</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Ordinance, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have gained legal status, and the number of people studying traditional Chinese medicine has increased. As a result, traditional Chinese medicine schools in various places have made significant progress. It is learned that the New China Medical College on Wangjia Sha Garden Road in this city is considered the best among all schools. The college was founded by famous figures in the medical community, such as Zhu Nanshan and Zhu Xiaonan. The current semester started on February 1st and formally began classes on the 5th. The originally planned 150 student slots have been filled. Recently, applications from various places continue to pour in. To educate more people, the college has decided to add classes to avoid turning people away. The original four Western-style houses are insufficient, so four more Western-style houses have been rented next to the college to accommodate the students. The college's funding has been secured, so the foundation is exceptionally solid. In terms of facilities, such as a reading room and sports field, everything is available. In terms of curriculum, in addition to systematically organizing common medical school subjects to make them practical and useful, specialized courses such as chemistry, anatomy, and pathology are offered to instill scholars with essential new knowledge. Furthermore, for the sake of students' advanced studies and practical experience, a graduate school, hospital, and laboratory are attached. It is reported that the current honorary president of the college is Gu Zhou, the president is Zhu Nanshan, the vice president and dean of discipline is Zhu He, the dean of the graduate school is Zhu Weiju, the dean of academic affairs is Bao Tianbai, and the director of administrative affairs is Huang Baozhong, all of whom are prominent figures in the medical field with extensive experience in running medical education.</p>

<p>Record of the Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Benevolence Association The Shanghai Benevolence Association held its 30th joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday. More than 30 people attended. Chairman Yang Wendao and recorder Lin Naichang performed the rituals as required. The chairman announced the reasons for the meeting: (A) Report Items: Secretary-General Guo and Comrade Chen Jieming, in order to promote the development of the association, initiated the holding of a bulletin board, using simple text and interesting pictures, to arouse members' enthusiasm for social welfare and mutual assistance. The first issue has been hung on the wall, and members are enthusiastically contributing articles. The survey section issued the first membership survey form. Most members have filled it out and returned it. A few have not yet returned it. After all are collected, statistical charts will be created and announced. Comrade Bao was previously sent south with a letter to invite Mr. Xu Fengshan to come north and lead our association. Comrade Bao reported back to Shanghai that he had obtained Mr. Xu's agreement to come north. After his family matters are settled, he will set off for Shanghai around the end of March or the beginning of April. Member Wen Guozhen passed away on January 27th. The association checked that his funeral maintenance fee had not exceeded the time limit, but the quarterly fee had exceeded the time limit stipulated in the charter, so he could not enjoy the rights according to the charter. However, he was very amiable, and it was only a temporary violation of the charter, which is deeply regrettable. The comrades only took care of his funeral expenses based on friendly feelings, which is also enough to show the enthusiasm for mutual assistance. The association's meetings are often reported in the Shen Bao newspaper. All our members who subscribe to the Shen Bao will know the progress of the association's affairs. (B) Discussion Items: What should be done with those who have not yet paid the spring membership fee? (Decision) The accounting department should send a letter to urge payment. If they still do not pay, Article 29 of the charter will be enforced. What should be done with those whose unpaid funeral maintenance fees have exceeded the fund? (Decision) Article 24 of the charter will be enforced. More than 20 members are unemployed in the spring. Measures should be taken to maintain them. (Decision) The job placement department should classify the unemployed members by industry and notify the members' factories and stores to employ or introduce them, so as to achieve the effect of mutual assistance. (C) Automatic Proposal: Comrade Ouyang Baowu proposed to revise the association's organizational law from eight shares to five shares to make the handling procedures more complete. (Decision) To be voted on by the general assembly. (Omitted)</p>

<h3>Publishing World</h3>
<p>Ningbo Daily to Be Published Today The third winter vacation of the Shanghai Ningbo Daily ended yesterday. It will be published as usual from today. However, the first board meeting of the fourth year of the newspaper decided to strive for reform this year to live up to the expectations of the fellow villagers. First, all the lead type will be recast and uniformly changed to the latest typefaces, undertaken by Chen Senji Type Foundry. At the same time, due to the increasing number of sales, the old machines are insufficient to cope. A new rotary machine has been retrofitted to produce more than 12,000 copies per hour. However, the above-mentioned typecasting and machine installation projects are constrained by the Lunar New Year, and the workers have returned to their hometowns and have not yet returned, so the installation and casting are not completed. Therefore, a small special edition will be published first today, and at the same time, work will be done day and night to complete all projects by the 10th of this month. From the 11th, in addition to restoring the normal large format, the internal compilation will also be completely new.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Cigarette Industry</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, No. 12)</p>
<p>I. History The habit of smoking in our country is very old. In addition to opium, which is deeply poisonous, people have long known how to cut tobacco leaves into fine strands and use copper water pipes or bamboo dry pipes to smoke at will, which is quite troublesome. Therefore, since cigarettes were imported from abroad, their popularity has continued to expand. Today, almost every remote village has traces of cigarettes. This is because cigarettes have novel styles and are more convenient to carry and smoke than other types of tobacco.</p>
<p>The earliest import of cigarettes was around 1890 (i.e., 22 years before the founding of the Republic of China). The earliest business was the American firm Lao Jinlong. At that time, the annual value was only several hundred thousand yuan. Later, it increased year by year. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, it increased to more than 40 million yuan, which is truly shocking. At the same time, British and American merchants established branch factories of the British American Tobacco Company in Shanghai, Hankou, and other places ten years before the founding of the Republic of China to manufacture locally. Their momentum was even stronger. The rise of Chinese-run cigarette companies was very slow. It was not heard until about seven years before the founding of the Republic of China. At that time, because the United States banned Chinese workers from entering the country, the Chinese were greatly stimulated. In the cigarette industry, they also rose up to seek independence. Companies such as the Samsung Company and Delong Tobacco Factory in Shanghai, the Dazhong Company in Peiping, the Beiyang Company in Tianjin, and the Nanyang Company in Guangzhou were all stimulated by the American anti-Chinese wave at that time. However, due to insufficient capital and lack of experience, the Nanyang Company was reorganized in a few years, and the other factories closed down. Later, when the European War broke out, foreign goods could not be imported continuously, and Chinese tobacco factories were able to take the opportunity to become active. After the May 30th Incident, anti-British sentiment was very strong throughout the country, and Chinese tobacco factories sprung up like mushrooms after rain, developing even more than during the European War. At that time, the popular Great Britain brand cigarettes (produced by the British American Tobacco Company) temporarily disappeared, which can be imagined. However, after the 17th year of the Republic of China, due to the government's increase in taxes and the dumping of foreign goods, Chinese tobacco factories showed a decline. In recent years, they have become even more depressed (see Section 3 of this article for details). Now, the statistics on the number of Chinese tobacco factories in Shanghai (those that set up factories for self-manufacturing) over the years are as follows: Year 5 of the Republic of China: 7; Year 19 of the Republic of China: 9; Year 14 and 15 of the Republic of China: 51; Year 15 of the Republic of China: 105; Year 16 of the Republic of China: 182; Year 17 of the Republic of China: 94; Year 20 of the Republic of China: 64; Year 23 of the Republic of China: 46.</p>
<p>(Note: The numbers are based on the "Report on the Tobacco Industry and the China Bank's Business in the 23rd Year of the Republic of China" compiled by the Shanghai Bank's Research Department. Those who specialize in making cigars are not included.)</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce in the country. Therefore, the rise and fall of the cigarette industry in Shanghai is sufficient to represent the prosperity and decline of the cigarette industry in the country. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Mailing Wins Over Zhenru Zhenru versus Mailing, a Shanghai Basketball Class A match, took place last night in the Shen. At the beginning of the fierce battle, Kuang, Cai, Yin, and Han each made contributions, and their momentum was impressive. The opponent only contributed one goal from Mo Fei, and the score was 12 to 3. Later, Mailing's Breish and Johnson worked hard and gradually approached. The two sides struggled very nervously. It is a pity that Wang Nanzhen's several shots did not enter the circle, and his luck was not good. At halftime, 14 to 11, Zhenru took the lead. As the battle started again, Wang Nanzhen made the first meritorious service. Mo Fei and Breish of Mai Ling scored consecutive hits, closely following each other. The three generals Cai, Han, and Kuang continued to shoot from far and near, reaching a climax, resulting in a score of 24 to 19. This was Zhenru's golden age. Afterwards, Kuang, the center, was injured and retired from the battle, and the military situation showed a bleak ending. Johnson's shooting was amazing, and the two players, Breish, also benefited from both sides, and with 25 to 24, they jumped ahead of Zhenru. Zhenru missed several opportunities, and the situation became unsalvageable. As a result, Mailing won the reversal with a score of 37 to 30.</p>

<h3>YMCA Amateur Boxing Match Li Menghua Zhou Defeated Buting Shi</h3>
<p>Wang Runlan's Striking Technique Was Very Good, Unfortunately, He Was Judged to Have Failed The 32nd Army's Four Athletes Gave Amazing Performances Yesterday</p>
<p>The 32nd Army boxing athletes met with famous Western boxing experts in the city at the YMCA gym at 9:15 last night. Boxing is still in its infancy in our country. The 32nd Army was the earliest to promote it, but it has only been around for two years. Therefore, the outcome of this competition cannot be regarded as a definitive evaluation. The boxing representatives of the 32nd Army came with the intention of sightseeing and exchanging ideas. There were more than 500 Chinese and Western spectators. The competition yesterday was originally divided into ten groups, and the fourth group was not held. The four athletes of the 32nd Army were from the sixth group to the ninth group. The details of their competition are as follows:</p>
<p>Jin Gui vs. Roland In the first round, Jin Gui took the offensive first, while Roland was very calm, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Jin was hit in the head and his nose bled. In the second round, he was taken advantage of by Roland. In the third round, he could only parry and was defeated.</p>
<p>Jin Guididi vs. Chaz Jin Guididi is the best boxing athlete in the 32nd Army. Unfortunately, in the first round, he was hit in the temple by his opponent and fell to the ground. He only got up after seven seconds. He was defeated in the third round.</p>
<p>Wang Runlan vs. Xiana In the first round, Wang waited for an opportunity to attack, and the opponent was hit many times, taking a clear advantage. The second and third rounds were a draw, so victory was really within his grasp. However, the referee announced Xiana's victory.</p>
<p>Li Menghua vs. Boting Shi Boting Shi is a student at St. John's University. From the perspective of boxing, he is not weak. Because Li's team had lost three times, he was determined to fight to the death. In the three rounds of the match, he had an absolute advantage. Boting Shi's mouth was hit by Li, and he bled a lot. As a result, Li won. The results of yesterday's competition are attached below:</p>
<p>First Group Su Chai Wins Jin Hezhi</p>

<h3>Attending the World Games Race Walking Requests to Increase the Number of People Shi Youhui Sends a Letter to the National Sports Association</h3>
<p>Our country is preparing to participate in the 11th World Games and has decided on several items, including football, basketball, track and field, swimming, weightlifting, traditional Chinese martial arts, and race walking. However, only one person is assigned to race walking. In order to request an increase in the number of people and for the future of race walking, Shi Youhui of the China Race Walking Association has sent a letter to Shen Siliang of the National Sports Association, which will be forwarded to the selection committee. The letter is excerpted as follows: Respected Sir, it was reported a few days ago that the number of people our country sent to participate in the World Games has been determined: 22 for football, 2 officials; 14 for basketball, 1 official; 12 for track and field, 1 official; 4 for swimming; 4 for weightlifting, 1 official; 6 for traditional Chinese martial arts, 1 official; 1 for race walking, etc. Reading this, I am very surprised. Everyone is ignorant of the art of race walking, and even sportspeople know very little about it. Therefore, the Chinese people do not pay attention to it and regard it with indifference. They do not know that it is only race walking that has added glory to our country in the history of international sports in this city. It has won the championship for six consecutive times, creating a new record for the future. And you, sir, have been enthusiastically promoting race walking, sparing no effort. Three years ago, you instructed us to prepare actively so as to achieve results. This time, at the National Games, it was included in the performance, and the results were close to the world record. Therefore, race walking is more promising for the World Games, which is beyond doubt. Now that 12 people have been set for track and field, 4 for swimming, and 4 for weightlifting, it is inappropriate and unexpected to only send one person for race walking, which is deeply regrettable. Moreover, race walking is a long-distance sport, and race walkers rely heavily on the encourager to encourage them to move forward and strive hard, but they have been omitted, which shows the lack of experience in race walking. For the sake of the future of race walking, I cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, I have specially presented my humble opinion: the number of race walkers should also be set at four, so as to become a strong team. I beg you to consider this carefully and forward it to the selection committee, and I hope to receive a reply. I am very grateful. Sincerely, Mr. Shen Siliang of the National Sports Association, Shi Youhui of the China Race Walking Association, February 3rd.</p>
<h3>Record of the China Youth Basketball Game Yesterday</h3>
<p>The 7th China Youth Basketball League held its 6th week of games yesterday at the China Youth Basketball Hall. A total of five games were played. The first game was between China-France and Nanyang in the school group. The strength of both sides was balanced, and the game was very exciting. In the first half, China-France cooperated with the whole army and won by one goal, slightly frustrating Nanyang. In the second half, Nanyang counterattacked fiercely and won one point over China-France with 16 to 15 despite being in a slump. However, compared with the points lost in the first half, they still lost one point. As a result, China-France won 30 to 29. The second game was between China Youth and Jicui Pavilion in the business group. China Youth has strong players such as Chen Xianglong, Yu Yuzi, and Ou Xianzhu, and its strength is strong, so victory is expected. In the first half, China Youth showed its skills and won Jicui Pavilion 46 to 0 in one go. In the second half, China Youth transferred a large number of troops, but it was still a one-sided game, and it scored 62 to 14. In total, China Youth defeated Jicui Pavilion 106 to 14.</p>

<h3>Public Concession, Last Year's Education Overview</h3>
<p>Private School Subsidies Total Over 370,000 Yuan, Chinese Teachers Hired for Chinese Children's Schools</p>
<p>The report for 1935 by the Director of the Education Department of the Public Concession's工局(Administration), has been submitted to the Board of Directors. It details the educational facilities for Chinese in the Public Concession, the conditions of schools for Western and Japanese children, the progress of bureau-run schools, and the distribution of subsidies for non-bureau-run schools. We have selected the main points for disclosure as follows: As of now, five bureau-run Chinese children's primary schools have been established, with a total of 3,320 students. There is also a well-equipped Western-style building used as a middle school for Chinese girls. In terms of Western schools, two girls' schools have been merged into one, occupying a new, spacious site, and a suitable building has been constructed in the Western District for a Western children's primary school.</p>
<p>Private School Subsidy Amounts: Regarding the subsidies for private schools, in 1931, only five Western-run schools received subsidies from the工部局(Administration). In 1932, Chinese people began to negotiate, and subsidies were issued to Chinese private schools. In 1935, the total amount of subsidies issued was 377,760 yuan, including 208,760 yuan for private Chinese schools and 169,000 yuan for private Western schools. However, this amount was limited, while the number of qualified private schools in the concession was extremely high. There was not enough to go around, which was the greatest difficulty faced by the Special Review Committee for Private School Subsidies this year. Furthermore, Japanese schools requested increased subsidies from the工部局(Administration) due to financial difficulties. The工部局(Administration) allocated an additional special subsidy of 10,000 yuan. Therefore, the number of Japanese schools was given a total of 108,000 yuan in subsidies. Including the above Japanese schools, the Public Concession's 13 private Western schools had a total of 9,292 students. Last year, they received a total of 199,000 yuan in subsidies, an increase of about one-tenth compared to the previous year. The number of Chinese private schools applying for subsidies increased significantly compared to the previous year. This year, 189 schools were verified as qualified, an increase of 44 compared to 1934. The total amount of subsidies received this year was 208,760 yuan, also an increase of slightly one-tenth compared to the previous year. Of this amount, 6,000 yuan was used to improve the school buildings of certain schools. Among all the schools, there were 32 middle schools and 157 primary schools, with a total of 37,808 students. The number of subsidies received by Chinese and Western private schools in recent years is listed below:</p>
<p>Chinese Schools: 1931, None; 1932, 113,986 yuan; 1933, 138,811 yuan; 1934, 186,375 yuan; 1935, 208,760 yuan.</p>
<p>Western Schools: 1931, 107,692 yuan; 1932, Same as before; 1933, 141,608 yuan; 1934, 153,850 yuan; 1935, 169,000 yuan.</p>
<p>1935 Annual Report further states: Due to financial difficulties this year, the original educational construction plan had to be continuously postponed. However, the Board of Directors has resolved that when the financial situation improves slightly in the future, the original plan will be carefully reconsidered. Regarding Chinese educational facilities, at the end of last year, the Board of Directors resolved to add a Chinese children's primary school at the old site of the Western Boys' School on Wenzaishi Road. If no other incidents occur in 1936, the expenses for the establishment of this school will be included in the budget.</p>
<p>Overview of Bureau-Run Chinese Children's Schools: The工部局(Administration) Girls' Middle School is located at No. 9 Singapore Road. The school building is newly built, with 500 students receiving the most modern education and training. Currently, there are a total of 10 bureau-run Chinese children's schools (day schools) and 1 night school, with a total of 6,383 students, an increase of 2,860 students compared to 1931, accounting for 81%.</p>
<p>In 1934, the工部局(Administration) Education Department established a subcommittee to investigate the five bureau-run Chinese middle schools and hold a joint examination to eliminate inconsistencies in standards upon graduation. After approval, the following resolutions were submitted to the Board of Directors for approval:</p>
<p>In June 1935, the five bureau-run Chinese middle schools will hold a joint examination at a central location. The questions should be consistent with the existing curriculum of each school, with room for selection and exchange to suit the scope of each school's curriculum.</p>
<p>The examination of certain subjects by outsiders will be postponed until the courses in each school are standardized and the number of participants in the Education Bureau's middle school examination is determined, then further discussion will be held.</p>
<p>Students of bureau-run middle schools should be encouraged to participate in the Education Bureau's middle school examination.</p>
<p>The above resolutions were made because the courses in each school are not yet completely the same, and it is not appropriate to rush to standardize them. Regarding the participation of students from bureau-run middle schools in the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's examination, it is because the various middle schools established by the 工部局(Administration) have been specially recognized by the Ministry of Education of the National Government, so students can participate in the examinations held by the Chinese authorities themselves.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the first joint examination of the five bureau-run middle schools was held in early June at Gezhi Public School. An examination committee was organized, with the principals of the five schools as the core, supplemented by an equal number of examiners from each school. 55 senior high school students participated in the examination. 40 students who passed the examination were awarded graduation certificates, of which 15 students with excellent results and an average score of over 80 were classified as excellent. This is a general overview of the 1935 joint examination of bureau-run middle schools.</p>
<p>Gradual Reduction of Western Teachers: According to the original policy of the工部局(Administration), Chinese teachers should be hired as much as possible in the bureau-run Chinese schools to replace Western teachers. Therefore, in the early spring of 1935, the 工部局(Administration) Education Department conducted a detailed discussion on whether the Western teachers in each school could be further reduced. After consideration, it was decided to first hire several Chinese teachers to teach subjects such as science and mathematics, and then hire Chinese teachers to teach English in the future.</p>
<p>Related to this matter, the reports of each school generally stated that students' Chinese studies have made significant progress. For example, students at Yucai Public School have made significant progress in Chinese composition, with considerable ideas and styles. Other subjects such as civics and geography have also achieved excellent results. The school library has also added a large number of Chinese books, which is of great benefit to the students' moral character. Furthermore, the report from Gezhi Public School also stated that two Western teachers had resigned from the school last year, so Chinese teachers have been used to teach English to junior students. However, a few Western English teachers are still retained in each grade to avoid overly rapid changes. Geography has been changed to Chinese textbooks, and other science and mathematics subjects are also gradually being taught in Chinese, starting with the junior grades. Furthermore, the school authorities reward students with outstanding Chinese composition in each grade to encourage students to study Chinese. This also shows the importance that the bureau-run schools attach to Chinese.</p>
<p>Increasing Development of Ball Sports: The annual reports of the Chinese children's schools established by the 工部局(Administration) are generally divided into two types: middle schools and primary schools. Generally speaking about the middle schools (including one girls' middle school), students' work is generally required to be quiet and diligent. However, students' interest in physical education and various sports is increasing. For example, the number of students participating in various sports at Yucai Public School has suddenly increased dramatically. The school's previous records have been broken in as many as four events. The football, basketball, and volleyball teams of Nie Zhongcheng Public School have achieved remarkable results. In addition to focusing on physical education, students at the Girls' Middle School also attach great importance to social life, including organizations such as drama clubs, debate clubs, and dance clubs.</p>
<p>In terms of primary schools, the total number of students in the spring and autumn of 1935 was 3,169 and 3,249 respectively. The attendance rate was 92%. The number of applicants at each school generally far exceeded the quota, especially at the Xinzha Road Western District Primary School. The courses at each school are generally conducted in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>The entrance examinations for each middle school were held in mid-June. A total of 124 students participated in the examination, of which 46 were graduates of bureau-run primary schools. Based on the examination results, scholarships were awarded to six graduates from bureau-run and non-bureau-run primary schools. A total of 269 students graduated this year. Before graduation, the Shanghai United Industries Guidance Society provided sufficient assistance to each student's future. Students from poor families and with excellent academic performance were given financial assistance. The funds were donated voluntarily by each school. In addition, the bureau-run schools have had an alumni association since 1933, and each school has established its own branch.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the number of students at the Jingzhou Road Night School this year was 306 in the spring and 455 in the autumn. These students are all students who work during the day. At the end of the spring semester, an examination was held, and diplomas were awarded to seven students. Their level is equivalent to that of graduates from other primary schools. They have all studied at the night school for a full year.</p>
<p>Public Concession Student Statistics: According to statistics on the total number of Chinese and foreign students in the Shanghai Public Concession, excluding non-bureau-run and middle and primary schools unrelated to the 工部局(Administration), the total number of students in various middle and primary schools owned by the bureau or subsidized by the bureau is 51,041, including 2,694 students in bureau-run Chinese middle schools, 3,689 students in bureau-run Chinese primary schools, 4,555 students in subsidized Chinese middle schools, 33,253 students in subsidized Chinese primary schools, 1,598 students in bureau-run Western schools, and 5,252 students in subsidized Western schools.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an analysis of the nationalities of students in the bureau-run Western schools shows that the 1,598 students come from 37 nationalities, with British accounting for the most, at 46%. The remaining nationalities are Russian at 18%, American at 8%, Portuguese at 5%, Japanese at 3%, and the remaining 20% being children from other countries.</p>
<h3>Schools in Beijing Set to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 4th) Nanjing University, Jinling University, and Jinling Women's University are all scheduled to open on the 6th. Middle schools in Beijing are also scheduled to open on the 6th and 7th.</p>
<h3>Dai Yingguan Returns to Beijing After Inspection</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th) Dai Yingguan, dispatched by the Ministry of Education to inspect compulsory education in Pingjinji (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei), returned to Beijing yesterday. According to him, the inspection lasted more than 40 days. Local educational administrative authorities are working hard to promote compulsory education, but in Tianjin, the failure of the municipal government to issue the four months of subsidies allocated by the central government has greatly affected the work. It is now being accelerated.</p>
<p>Educational Film Mobile Screenings: From February 6th to 28th, screenings will be held in rotation at social education institutions in various counties.</p>

<h3>Liu Haisu and Others Initiate the Organization of the China Fine Arts Association</h3>
<p>The first preparatory meeting was held yesterday, and the association is scheduled to be established on March 15th.</p>
<p>In order to develop the fine arts and create the art of the times, more than 140 people from the art world, including Liu Haisu, jointly initiated the organization of the China Fine Arts Association as a central organization. They have convened a meeting of the initiators and the first preparatory meeting, and plan to hold the inaugural meeting on March 15th. They are now actively soliciting members. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting of Initiators: The association held a meeting of initiators the other day at No. 504 Lafayette Road. Those present included Liu Haisu, Wang Jiyuan, Ma Gongyu, Ni Yide, Xu Xuangu, He Mingqi, Yan Kechang, Xie Haiyan, Zhang Chengjiang, Pan Yuliang, Xie Gongzhan, Xiang Peiliang, Liu Kang, Chen Renhao, Wang Yuanbo, Li Jian, and others, totaling more than 20 people. Liu Haisu was the chairman, and Xie Haiyan was the secretary.</p>
<p>Organizational Aim: First, Chairman Liu Haisu reported on the aim of initiating the organization of the China Fine Arts Association, stating that China is an ancient country with the most brilliant culture, and the great achievements of fine arts in various dynasties surpass those of all countries in the world. But what has been presented to us in recent years? Those who talk about the history of modern culture do not even put us in their eyes. In other words, we have no modern culture. Those of us who are born in modern China and are involved in the fine arts and culture world feel ashamed to death when we think about it. In the past, I and others, considering that the prosperity and strength of a country and nation are not entirely based on strong ships and powerful artillery, but that its international status is determined by the rise and fall of culture, and that fine arts are a major field of culture, wanted to do their part for the society and nation in this major field. Therefore, the establishment of fine arts schools was initiated to cultivate basic people, and then the Tianma Association was initiated to carry out a general art movement. The greatness of its achievements and the depth of its impact can be said to have completed its initial journey in the early modern art world. Later, because I left the country in a hurry, the Tianma Association also ceased to exist in name. After returning from two trips to Europe, I saw that the art world was even more decadent and desolate than in the past. I repeatedly thought about how to revitalize it. On January 6th, I and the initiators present held the first discussion meeting at Hailu on Lafayette Road and initiated the organization of this association to unite comrades in the fine arts world and work together to develop the fine arts, taking this association as the central organization to create an art of the times and complete our historical mission, washing away the shame of having no modern culture.</p>
<p>Key Resolutions: Following the discussion, the following resolutions were made: The association should handle the application for permission. It was resolved that the application should be signed by the initiators according to the legal number of people. When applying for permission according to the Law on the Organization of People's Groups, representatives of the initiators should be elected to be responsible for external affairs. It was resolved to elect Liu Haisu as the representative of the initiators. Preparatory personnel should be elected to be responsible for carrying out the preparations. It was resolved to elect Liu Haisu, Wang Jiyuan, Ma Gongyu, Ni Yide, Xie Haiyan, Yan Kechang, Xie Gongzhan, and Xiang Peiliang as the preparatory members, with Liu Haisu as the convener. The draft articles of association were discussed, and it was resolved that the draft articles of association should be adopted in principle, and Xie Haiyan, Xiang Peiliang, Yan Kechang, and Ni Yide should revise them. How to carry out the collection of members was discussed and it was resolved: Members should be collected separately by the initiators. Members should be collected by mail. How to plan the preparatory funds for the association was discussed, and it was resolved that the funds should be freely donated by the initiators. The date of the inaugural meeting of the association was decided to be March 15th. The address of the association was decided to be temporarily at No. 440 Caishi Road. How the association emblem should be designed was discussed, and it was resolved: Liu Haisu, Wang Jiyuan, Ma Gongyu, Yan Kechang, Xiang Peiliang, Ni Yide, Xie Haiyan, He Mingzhai, Li Jian, Wang Baiyuan, Zheng Yuebo, Fang Bingchao, Zhou Duo, Bi Zheng, Liu Kang, and Chen Renhao were elected to design and draw the emblem.</p>

It is reported that Jing Hengyi, Mei Lanfang, Chen Shuren, and others will join.</p>
<p>China Law Education Association: Inaugural Meeting Held in Shanghai Today, Composed of 18 Law Schools Nationwide</p>

<h3>Children's Educational Novel: Little Men (I) (VI) (VII)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>This confession was not well written, the handwriting was also hasty, leaving many ink spots, and it was very short; but Don regarded it as a treasure; after Mr. Bhaer read it, Don ran to his side, his eyes clear, his attitude simple and respectful—this is what they had always taught him to be—but he said with a slightly trembling voice:</p>
<p>"I said I shouldn't lie, please forgive me, sir."</p>
<p>"This is a well-intentioned lie, Don, I cannot but forgive this, but you see it is useless," Mr. Bhaer said, putting one hand on each shoulder, his face full of love and comfort.</p>
<p>"This keeps the boys from bothering Nat anymore. That's what I did it for. He can't take the pain, I don't mind," Don said, as if after a long, painful silence, he frankly told his innermost thoughts.</p>
<p>"How could you do that? You treat me so well," Nat said, trembling, wishing he could hug his friend and cry; both of these were childish behaviors, and if he had really done it, Don would have learned to be ashamed and have nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>"Now everything is fine, old friend, so don't be a fool anymore," he said, swallowing a large lump of resentment in his throat, and laughing heartily, which he hadn't done for weeks. He then asked eagerly, "I wonder if Mrs. Bhaer knows?"</p>

<h3>Paintings of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>— (Ning Yu)</p>
<p>I once saw paintings from Abyssinia somewhere. The subjects were mostly about war and religion: the 1896 Battle of Adwa between the Abyssinians and the Italians, the Garden of Eden, the war between good and evil, etc. One of their most striking features was that good people were always painted frontally, while bad people were only painted in profile. For example, the Italians who waged war against Abyssinia were all painted in profile, while their own soldiers were all painted frontally, even though their muskets were aimed directly at the enemy.</p>
<p>This lack of perspective, this peculiar technique, seems very naive from an artistic point of view. However, they aroused my inexplicable fondness.</p>
<p>China has a similar expression, which is the application of facial makeup in drama. Using different colors and strokes to distinguish clearly between good and evil people is a little more technically advanced. But many viewers do not understand the distinction, and it is not as clear as the Abyssinian paintings.</p>
<p>So I thought: if the people in the world were truly divided into good and evil, and expressed using the Abyssinian method, wouldn't it be much easier to be a person than it is now? At the very least, it would be worth calling out a few times when people look at it! I just think that good people should be painted in profile and bad people should be painted frontally, because now it is a world where bad people are in front.</p>
<h3>Carved Dwarf Drum</h3>
<p>— Chen Yuling</p>
<p>Dwarf Drum, a man from Minhou, whose name is lost, was short in stature with a large belly, so he was called Dwarf Drum. The mountains of Min produce a lot of wood, the roots of which are intertwined and gnarled, and are known for their sturdiness. Woodworkers carve them into figures, flowers, and the like, but Dwarf Drum's skill is particularly refined. However, Dwarf Drum had a strange habit: every time he received wages, he would spend them all before starting work. If he had leftover grain in his jar, he would always abandon his work to play. He traveled among nobles and high officials, never flattering them to gain favor. Chen Zichang, the son of Minister Chen of Luojiang, and a predecessor of Grand Tutor Tao'an, summoned Dwarf Drum to carve wood. The Chen family was at the height of its power, accustomed to issuing commands, and did not treat Dwarf Drum with respect. Dwarf Drum was displeased. He responded vaguely, and the work was delayed for a long time without completion. When servants were sent to check on him, the basic form was still not there. Enraged, Chen imprisoned him. Dwarf Drum, feeling unhappy in prison, used his work to pass the time, creating several figures, which he returned to the minister, and was released. The former prefect Liu Buxi treated Dwarf Drum with exceptional kindness, providing him with food and drink whenever he came, along with other delicacies he liked. Dwarf Drum, after eating and drinking to his fill, would leave immediately, returning another day. After Dwarf Drum had troubled his master several times, he also wanted to do something for him, so he asked the master, "Do you have fine wood you would like me to carve?" The Liu family had a rich store of wood, and selected the best pieces to give to Dwarf Drum, without setting a deadline. Dwarf Drum was sure to repay the favor and put extra effort into it. Dwarf Drum had a disciple named Mou, whose carving of figures was also quite admirable. Dwarf Drum said, "You are only good at grinding and polishing, not worth mentioning in terms of knife skills. A knife is only valuable if it boosts its owner, but yours are all dull and flat." The disciple said, "Please tell me the way to sharpen and uplift them." Dwarf Drum said, "This cannot be explained in words." Could Dwarf Drum be keeping something secret, or is skill really something that cannot be taught? Someone in the market showed him a printed image of a sacred statue carved by Duanmu in boxwood. Dwarf Drum said, "Everywhere is simple and rustic, everywhere is spiritual. People today know the spiritual is spiritual, but they don't know the rustic is spiritual." Tasting his words, one realizes he understands calligraphy and painting, but I have never seen him hold a brush to do them. Dwarf Drum was famous between the Guangxu and Xuantong eras, and died around the beginning of the Republic of China. He had a solitary nature, so he didn't produce much. What I have seen includes a Bodhidharma, less than a foot tall, with extremely lively posture. The wood had a flaw on the back, protruding out and impossible to carve, so he took advantage of the shape to make him carry a bamboo hat. Another is a Drunken Immortal, lying on his back with his head uncovered, his hair a tangled mess of who knows how many thousands of strands. One leg is bent, one stretched out, with all the muscles and bones exposed, and the straw sandals he wears are also exquisitely made. These two were seen at the home of Liu Zhongzan, my father's colleague, who was a cousin of Buxi.</p>
<h3>A Record of Silhouette Artist Huang Yinian</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>A few months ago, a silhouette artist came to Nanjing, who could cut a profile portrait from a piece of paper in just three or four minutes. It could be said to be an extraordinary skill, as it could be cut so vividly!</p>
<p>This silhouette artist's surname is Huang, his name is Yinian. He is a graduate of the Xinhua Fine Arts School in Shanghai. He had filmed the movie "Guangming" in the film section of the Nanchang Headquarters. He has considerable research on woodcuts and carvings. Later, he came up with this silhouette method from woodcuts and carvings. He has received a lot of praise. So he came to Nanjing and set up the sign of silhouette artist. Because this kind of silhouette was rare in the past, many people in the capital went to have their silhouettes cut. His price for silhouette is one yuan per person. He also set up a preferential treatment for students. All students who come to cut will be charged half price, only five corners will do. According to Mr. Huang, this kind of silhouette is not a valuable thing. However, it requires research on carving and woodcut. Because it is not difficult to cut a silhouette of a person, but it is not easy to cut it vividly and accurately!</p>
<p>I have always said: Chinese art is really worthy of admiration. Take the woman who cuts patterns, for example. They can cut various ingenious patterns casually. If you do not have artistic talent, it seems that you cannot cut it so satisfactorily. It is already not easy to cut patterns, and it is certainly more difficult to cut a person's silhouette! So I said that your silhouette is half research and half talent.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Viola (Alto Violin)</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>I am one who is not often noticed. My name is Viola. I can't catch up with my petite and young sister, the Violin, who is so splendid, nor as large and loud as my brother, "Cello"—the Bass Viola.</p>
<p>Because of my close relationship with famous figures in "strings", my personality has lost a lot. I am always helping others, mixing with their tones, and not paying much attention to myself.</p>
<p>At first, I also set off the treble; after many years, the Violin replaced my position. Now, I specialize in alto or sub-alto. My style is similar to the Violin, but my body is one-fifth larger than hers. My sound is one-fifth lower than the Violin, my strings are slightly thicker, and my bow is slightly shorter and thicker. However, whether plucked with fingers or pulled by hand, I can make the same tones as my versatile sister. Those who criticize me say that I am sad, indifferent, and clumsy; but I am confident that my treble is very soft and beautiful.</p>
<p>The famous composer, in his symphony "Harold in Italy," regarded me as an important character. Wagner repeatedly invited me to play a role. In orchestras that can recognize my expressive genius, my position is gradually becoming more important.</p>
<p>I hope I will always be willing to play a role in accompaniment music, and occupy a position with other instruments in the second and third part music. I am called "the philosopher of stringed instruments" because I have a humble nature that is willing to help others.</p>
<p>Many beginners who can't play the Violin well give me a successful second chance, because they should learn from me before learning the Violin.</p>
<h3>A Casual Talk on Cursive Script</h3>
<p>— Zhen Lü</p>
<p>The strength of cursive script lies in the whole piece, just like the completion of an article. It is not flawed by one or two characters; its difficulty also lies in this. What it has most in common with an article, which cannot be ignored, is that it moves with energy; although there are many twists and turns in the middle, the whole must seek consistency, which is called a good work. If, when writing, emotions arise and the momentum changes, wonderful interests will naturally be achieved, which cannot be predetermined. Predetermination leads to nothing, which is the constant principle of all artistic endeavors. Don't you see that when writing cursive script in a drunken state, it often becomes more and more spirited? How can I know myself?</p>
<p>In our country's calligraphy, regular, cursive, clerical, and seal scripts each reach their own wonders, but cursive script takes the strengths of each style and integrates them into a great achievement, and intricately transforms them, thus purely proceeding with artistic conditions and being rich in the beauty of curves. Therefore, cursive script is in harmony with all calligraphy, and it is especially suitable for freehand sketching calligraphy. If you use the method of cursive script to paint, it must be a vivid painting; if you can use the method of painting to write cursive script, that is called cursive script. There are those in the world who spend their whole lives painting without knowing what cursive script is, but there is no one who can recognize the wonders of cursive script without knowing painting, and there is no one who is good at cursive script but does not understand the principles of painting. This is because painting has the interest of cursive script, while cursive script fully possesses the many strengths of painting.</p>
<h3>Cannot Run Fast</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Some say that those who excel in cursive script may not also be good at regular script, or even that it is unnecessary. This is a fallacy, not something that someone who understands would say. Cursive script is transformed from running script, and running script comes from regular script; this is the fixed step in our country's calligraphy, and the principle can also be measured. If we use the position of cursive script as myself, then running script is my father and regular script is my grandfather. Who says I can do cursive but not regular? Isn't that a reckless person who forgets his ancestors? The ancients said, "Regular script is like standing, running script is like walking, cursive script is like running," which is indeed a close analogy. It is rare in the world to find someone who can only run but cannot stand. However, regular script is like standing, emphasizing stillness, while cursive script is like running, emphasizing movement. Liking movement and disliking stillness is the constant feeling of ordinary people. Therefore, there are those who enjoy writing cursive script, falsely claiming that they cannot do regular script, avoiding what they do not want to do. People then follow suit and make excuses for them. If someone comes along who becomes famous for cursive script but cannot do regular script, then their cursive script is like a wild fox spirit, and there will be little good in the end. They will only be stealing names and deceiving the world! Therefore, "a gentleman devotes himself to the root." Those who aspire to cursive script cannot fail to think of this.</p>
<p>The world is so big, and there are many kinds of people. They are distinguished by color, and the weak are bullied by the strong. They are accustomed to being far apart, but in the beginning, they were the same. "Mama" and "Papa" come from childhood; the beginning of language is no different between Chinese and foreigners. Looking into the writing, the evolution needs a period, tying knots to record events, and the line is maintained. Crab-like winding is mature in the West; our country uses pictographs, bird tracks and beast hooves. People have the same heart, and hearts have the same reason. Tracing its origin, it is probably so! The text changes gradually, and it becomes what we see today. Our Chinese set of books is the fixed image of painting shapes; archaeologists should have the same view. Then the unique beauty and reason of our calligraphy, but Qinxi has no name here, because it is difficult to seek its deep understanding because of the different paths it takes. The matter is true, and it is clearly visible! Therefore, the book has the inscriptions on bells and tripods, and stone drums, which is the pattern school of painting. The book has passed through the official script through the Han and Wei Dynasties, and it has entered the regular script. The painting has the Cubist school and the Impressionist school. Each has its own appearance, which takes a lot of people's exploration to find a similar one. If the book becomes cursive, it will increase its complexity, twists and turns, and windings. It will expand its use of pen and ink, and it will not be the realm of painting into sketching? Since my book has the bone and tire of painting, and the cursive script is added to make it clearer, we will see that our people will eventually have a picture-like script to show the world, so as to invite the mind of those who are knowledgeable!</p>
<h3>Ink Marks on Bamboo Leaves</h3>
<p>— (Huangshan Nong)</p>
<p>Yixian County is surrounded by mountains and has excellent scenery. About five miles away from Taoyuan Cave, there are many bamboos, thick and dense. The leaves of ordinary bamboo are green, but the ones produced here are black, as if dyed with ink. Even after a long period of rain and sun, the color does not fade, which is very peculiar. Asking the locals, there are two explanations: one is that Li Qinglian of the Tang Dynasty once traveled here and wrote poems on the stone wall, splashing the remaining ink on the bamboo, like the story of Xiangfei's mottled bamboo. Another explanation is that the nearby coal mines are rich, and they are usually affected by its quality, resulting in this difference. The former is a myth, which cannot be investigated. Although the latter has a little reason, there are many bamboo-producing areas in the coal area, but those whose leaves are black have never been heard before, which is also a question.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Three: The Resolute Filing of a Lawsuit After Eloquent Talk Around the Room, and the Forgetting of Past Grievances for Profit After Pouring Wine in Nostalgic Friendship</p>
<p>Wang Shicheng smiled and said, "We are selling property. As long as someone gives us the price, we can sell it. We don't necessarily recognize anyone." Jia Duocai cupped his hands and said, "That's good. The location and time are written on my note. Let's talk face-to-face tomorrow morning." Wang Shicheng said, "However, since we are changing buyers, I can't make the decision alone. I have to ask a gentleman from my clan to come out and be jointly responsible." Jia Duocai said, "Then please ask that gentleman to come with you. Although I don't know him, we will get acquainted when we meet, and we will be friends the second time we meet. Please tell your esteemed kinsman that I welcome him to talk." Wang Shicheng said, "Since Mr. Zi has such good intentions, I will definitely bring him along." Jia Duocai heard him use the last character of his name as his surname, and wanted to correct him, but Wang Shicheng hurriedly walked away, and it was too late to correct him. He planned in his heart that if this deal succeeds, he can at least get three thousand yuan from the large amount of money. With the land, he can also get the construction company's project in his hands, and he can make a fortune on this. It's really that when wealth comes, even the door can't stop it. He had long wanted to find a piece of land next to the future railway station, but no matter what he did, he couldn't buy one piece of land. Unexpectedly, it happened by chance, and such a large piece of land was for sale, and with just a few words, he got the matter into his hands. He was so happy that he immediately threw the matter of Yueying to the back of his mind, and lay down on the bed freely and comfortably. Although he was a person who liked to sleep late, when he arrived in Xi'an, he had to follow the locals and get up early. The locals get up at five o'clock, and Jia Duocai has no choice but to get up at seven or eight o'clock. Every morning, he stays at home, drinking tea and eating snacks, and only goes out after ten o'clock, but today is different. He got up at five o'clock, just like the people of Xi'an. Seeing that the door of Mr. Jin's room next door was tightly closed, he hurriedly washed his face, drank a cup of tea, and went out without waiting for the local newspaper to be delivered. He couldn't help but smile in his heart. Jin Ziqiang is still in his dream, and the deal that he has put so much effort into has been unknowingly snatched by me. After he gets up and can't see me, he won't be on guard. (Three Hundred and Ninety-Nine)</p>
<h3>Preface to Ma Gongyu's Seal Album</h3>
<p>— Posthumous Work of Sun Deqian</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Gongyu of Yongjia is a gentleman of erudition today. He inherited his family learning at a young age and was skilled in poetry and prose. He was good at painting and calligraphy, and especially proficient in seal carving. He brought out his seal album and asked for an inscription. I have never studied the words of epigraphy. How can I be like Yuan Yan, who has high reputation, and can be compared to Chen Si? How can I dare to comment rashly? However, I have heard that the principle of writing and calligraphy is the same. Copying shapes and sounds is also like painting and engraving. Therefore, the theory of discriminating carving, is it not an allegory in Zhuangzi? Chasing and carving for pleasure, did Xiqi not chant elegantly? Although the hero of the Han Dynasty despised it as carved insects, and Liang Xie compared it to carved birds in Zhen Quan, it can be understood. Moreover, the knife and chisel travel their art, and stone ink engraves its brilliance. Penetrating the subtleties, goodness is not obtained late. Exhausting the momentum of the tiger warrior, the skill is ingenious and divine. Gongyu's wonderful creation is natural, and the branch advances to the Tao. It is appropriate that they are linked together like pearls and compete for brilliance, and that the secret treasures are cherished together. The seal is used for trust. The characters follow the festival. The symbol is auspicious, and Zhou is honored. Its use is parallel to the seal, and the distinction between high and low is strict in Qin. The red sign touches the spirit, the yellow spirit harmonizes virtue, the five numbers seek契, and the additions make a speech. Hundred officials govern, and make different systems by distinguishing. As for the breaking of jade since Wei, it is said to be the private affairs of Cao Huan. Yuan Yi began to cast copper from the system of Wang Mian. This is the source that can be reached, and its function is to publicize the letter. The body of the seal is modeled. Qin has a special book. The seal is called "Miu Zhuan", and it comes from a long way. Since the recent world, the authors have been crowded. Only Zhejiang and Wan, the flow and distinction flourished. Exploring the origin of Huang Jie and following the old man of Chen Si, establish a special door and each practice, pass the bowl to each other, and remove the strange changes of the township wall, hold the bucket without concealing, and the gods and rules, is it not beautiful? Only if there is no new change, can evil replace the male? Therefore, Qi and Lu are facing the mud, and the world is gradually widespread. The formula of Fan Shenghong turns to the decline of carving. It is also from the falling of the magpie, and it also follows the hammering and breaking. This is the creation of the pot house, and the runners respond to it. It is like another rain competing for newness, and the Yuan wind alone fans it. Gongyu is naturally precise and accumulated. The understanding of the cow is so rich. The art of decomposing the ox is like a new grinding. According to the formula of collecting foxes, he can repair the old text. If Yuan Ting's Liu Fen, should know the strange characters. Then he is familiar with stone carvings, and the Huju foot is a famous family. Although the flower is beautiful, he has been good at elegance since childhood. Depending on the grass, he is charming, and he is different and lucky. Shangu saw the withdrawal of the hermit, and the Qiu壑 passed the spirit of Zijing. Those who spread the world far away are not all here. However, this Hongzhao will stay for a long time, and the rhinoceros heart will operate independently. Looking at the hundreds of names above Kan, I laugh alone in a volume. It has made it difficult to speak of the sea, and to hide the mountains as prosperous. I am ashamed to write, and I am tired of carving the dragon. The white snow is high, and I know that the eyes of the harmony are few. Qingyun Kufu, fortunately, the benefits of 相得 are more obvious. I don't worry about being mediocre and sparse, so I will write the preface.</p>

<h3>Finance: Large Investors Buy After Selling Off; Initial Gold Price Weak Then Steady; Final Result Still Down 1.21 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw large bar exchange rates increase and major investors taking the opportunity to sell off. The central bank's US dollar exchange rate listing increased, the domestic market loosened considerably, and many long positions were closed, causing the market to weaken in the first ten sessions. Afterwards, major investors covered short positions and hedged, gradually stabilizing the market. Initially, overseas silver markets saw English up and American stocks bullish, with forward silver prices in Monterry all rising by five cents.

The central bank's listed exchange rates were announced, with English flat and American up by half a yuan. The offshore gold unit was not strong, and the standard gold price was listed at 1145 yuan.

Fuxingyong Shenfeng Rong Yuanyong Qian Yuanyong Yuxinxiang Futai Yong Dafayong Yongde Tongfu Shunli Xiang Feng Qia Fengyong and others were on the seller side. Dacheng Kou Chang Hengyu went in first and then out, and Feng Chang Yuan Fayong Xianghe went out first and then in.</p>
<p>According to the market situation for the day, because there were large investors and Dacheng buying in, the market was weak at first and then flat. The morning opening was 1145 yuan, and the closing price was 1147 yuan.

<p>( ) Yesterday's source of various gangs only arrived at more than 20 numbers, (a total of more than 4,000 stones of goods). The sales market on this street is ultimately normal at the beginning of the year. Bag Wei such as Tianjin and Qing gangs did seven or eight hundred packages of thick japonica rice and more than 1,500 packages of thin rice. Therefore, each thick early japonica rice is set for zero sales, and thin rice and other market conditions add four points for bag sales. The rest such as Yuan Yangjian are flat, and Yin Bian has no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North) More than 40 down the river, sales of various goods on the market, scattered transactions of white japonica high goods are deserted, medium and secondary continued to move, the price is high and fixed, medium and low rice are tight, and the number of points, thin rice and Tianjin Wei turned sluggish, zero is still available, early rice is soft, Foreign Dudu Jian Dao sales are both harmonious, and Ke Jian stands firm. Bai Yuan’s retail sale is slightly better, and the price has also tightened. The rest of the goods are similar to the previous ones.</p>
<h3>Foreign Zhuang Sesame First Fell and Then Rose</h3>
<p>Yangzhuang sesame, first inherited the fatigue of the previous day, resulting in a bad market climate. A small number of cargo households shouted cheaply, and as a result of soliciting, 300 tons were handled by Xiaoyanghang, and delivery was still ordered in February. The price opened at 11 yuan, a sharp drop of 3 jiao compared with the previous day. After the tragic drop, the handling stomach was aroused, but not much was sold, and the ocean bank immediately released and adopted, with a transaction of 200 tons, and the price rose back to 11 yuan and 3 jiao. Therefore, according to the overall situation, there is still no large number of inquiries, and the market situation is trending to a swirling situation. Soybeans was temporarily frustrated because Dalian City suddenly fell, and the unified market traded a total of 2,000 packages of various beans by car, and Fu Lu was Guangdong Bang Shantou Fuzhou Xiamen and this street, mixed with a small number of Wentai Gang.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt Market Before and After Closing</h3>
<p>The asphalt was in the last year because of the large scale in Zhejiang Province, so the scientific season sales of this port are all Zhejiang oil, and the production of Han oil is more marginal. Jingzhou Zhijiang and other Shan arrived in Han after the winter solstice, and it should have been too late to sell it in Shanghai. Therefore, at the beginning of the new year, the entire Shanghai port relied on the supply of Zhejiang oil. Not only Shanghai Port, but also places such as Sutick often rely on Zhejiang. However, Shanghai Line Case is based on Han oil as the main body. If it is easy to use Zhejiang oil, the towns in the mainland will tend to Zhejiang Province, resulting in the contraction of the place where the shops are blocked, and the only fan is only for this port. Moreover, in recent years, the candle shop market has been declining day by day, and only the soap factory that relies on it to make up for it is not very large. The person who specializes in soap oil is another person, and the trader has been lagging behind. Therefore, there is no development in the asphalt industry. The larger business scope should be pushed to the two companies of Heda Kee Yinda, who can still maintain the scope they have. The annual profit is extremely gold, and the rest are small in scope, but there are also by-products such as white oil and essence, so they can also make profits, but there are only seven or eight companies in total. Stable operation, so the number of sites has rarely changed over the years. After the general closing, the opening market is still stable. I heard that there is a transaction in a bank in Hanshi recently. It is estimated that 2,000 pieces of Macheng have been sold, and the market is priced at about 16 yuan per burden, which is about 4 jiao higher than the closing price last season. The opening price in the future may also be 16 yuan. The closing price of Chongjing Hanshi is 10% more than 6 jiao, and the opening price will definitely increase slightly. The Spring Plate in this city was discussed the day before, Chongjing was 21 yuan and 2 jiao per burden, and mixed weight was 21 yuan, Macheng city was 18 yuan and 8 jiao per burden. However, the head shop sales market this spring is far less than in previous years, resulting in shops hesitating to watch the spring plate purchase. Although the Hanshi is unusually solid, the hearts of Zhejiang oil people are weaker, resulting in a strong north and a tired south.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Hainan Red Is Reduced By Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the market was still firm. The Association marked 24 coarse sand white spot 22 yuan and 7 jiao, transfer goods 7 yuan and 7 jiao, Dongchi of 8 and 9 and Dong Bai all called the original price, there was no change, and the cotton white of this factory was also scarce. The mark was that the Chao gang continued to open Huanggangqing, etc. The price was fixed, and more than 100 bags of new water red were opened, the price was 12 yuan and 7 jiao, and the second was 12 yuan and 3 jiao. The Guangchao gang opened 300 bags of Hainan red, The price is 12 yuan and half to 12 yuan and 4 jiao, which is 5 jiao lower than the first market.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Golden Needle Vegetables Are Under Pressure</h3>
<p>Golden needle vegetables have been rising too much in recent days, and the actual sales are waiting and watching, and they are unwilling to buy more. Moreover, the Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs with the widest sales, because the surface of the market in is not too high, and the eating appetite is not prosperous, the parties are mindful of selling, and the market is bound to be frustrated, and it will be inevitable to increase and decline.</p>
<h3>Hardware: White Lead Skin Market Price Drops</h3>
<p>The overseas pricing of white lead skin has rebounded from £18 and 15 shillings to £20 and 5 shillings. The solid city of this port should be tightened, but the environment is harsh, and the recent trend is exactly the opposite. It is that more goods arrive and less output, the hearts of the people are weakened and the market is declining, so the selling market has repeatedly fallen. The city’s No. 2 is 30 yuan per burden, No. 3 is 30 yuan and 5 jiao, No. 4 and No. 5 are estimated at 32 yuan, and No. 6 to No. 10 only cost 29 yuan and 5 jiao, which is 5 jiao to 2 yuan less than before. It is heard that large-scale and current exchange transactions can be quoted lower.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Skin New Goods Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The new goods of Huangpai brand black iron skin, which has been short for many days, were loaded from the United States yesterday and unloaded at the Dalai Wharf. Therefore, the magnetic factories and ordnance factories that need this product. I heard that they all left spot, and its thick flower color was sold for 12 yuan and 5 jiao per burden, and the thin flower color was estimated at 13 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. It is found that a total of six or seven hundred sets have been opened, and according to the recent foreign pricing, the market situation of this product may not be easy to return for a while.</p>
<h3>Head: Neelun This Street First Transaction</h3>
<p>Because the opening price of Red Plate is expensive, the transaction of Neelun is dull, and the door shop gang in this street has already opened to meet the market. Starting yesterday, the Neelun big and small colleagues are all open all day, and the business of the Neelun door shop houses along Henan Road has increased. The Huate Neel cable Peiqi thin flower sells a lot, in addition to the colleagues door shop gang, the seller also agreed to cover the return order, and the lending of the Western clothing gang is very careful. Because most of the Zhuang Zhe of the ocean trip have not been completed, and the new goods are crowded at customs, the procedures are slower.</p>
<h3>Survey: Report on Lower Peng Huasi Exports Last Month</h3>
<p>From January 16th to January 31st, a total of 1,561 packages of raw silk and 824 packages of waste silk were exported, totaling 2,4. Now, the silk transported to various places is listed as follows:</p>

<p>Import</p>
<p>(Note) From May to this month, the total quantity of imported vegetables inspected totaled 27,898.64</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Whistle</p>
<p>The other day, Mr. Suma Yakichiro, First Class Secretary of the Japanese Embassy and concurrently Consul-General stationed in Beijing, returned to Shanghai on orders, intending to go to Beijing to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang and present his views on Sino-Japanese relations. When Suma passed through Shanghai, he told Japanese reporters that during his return to Japan, he had consulted with Foreign Minister Hirota, military authorities, and important figures from both the government and the public. They had a new understanding of the Sino-Japanese problem, and some were worried about the future of Sino-Japanese relations, even questioning the need for Sino-Japanese conferences.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The emperor is not anxious, but the eunuch is frantic," and "The sheep is not anxious, but the tiger is frantic." It's truly a laughing matter. Japan is the country engaging in aggression, and our country is the one being invaded. Our people should be worried but are not, while the Japanese should not be worried but are. This is worrying about what others don't usually worry about and not worrying about what others should worry about. I advise the Japanese to put their minds at ease and do whatever they want without concern.</p>
<p>The other day, a certain newspaper reported that Prince De had declared the establishment of an "Autonomous Government" in Chahar Province, with the government located in Zhangbei, claiming to be a continuation of the Yuan Dynasty. The flag of the autonomous government is red, yellow, blue, and white. Recently, Prince De took a plane given by the Japanese some time ago to Xinjing in Manchuria for several discussions. It is said that an agreement was reached with Puyi, with Manchuria supplying military supplies to the new Mongolian government, and so on.</p>
<p>Later, we received a telegram from the Central News Agency correcting this matter, stating that Prince De had sent a telegram to clarify the situation. I generally do not trust foreign newspapers and news agencies because they specialize in spreading rumors. Therefore, when I read ancient books, I am reminded of the saying, "To believe everything written in a book is worse than having no book at all," and I cannot help but feel emotional.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Hanmin, who has been the focus of Chinese and foreign attention, has already returned to China and will soon go to Beijing to preside over the affairs of the Central Standing Committee. He recently made a statement in Hong Kong, saying, "In short, the Party should be restored to a party with principles and spirit, and strive to eliminate the past mistakes of fragmentation and disunity, in order to continue the Party's unfinished great cause. The government should be transformed into a responsible and capable government, and strive to correct the past mistakes of fear and complacency, in order to shoulder the heavy responsibility of resolving national crises and building the nation."</p>
<p>These few sentences are truly valuable. However, in recent times, important figures have had a common problem: what they say offstage often does not match the reality onstage. In their time out of power, they speak eloquently, but once they are in power, they become silent and cannot implement their proposals from when they were out of power. At this moment, I can only hope that after Mr. Hu Hanmin takes office, he can fulfill everything he has said now.</p>
<p>The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Ariyoshi Akira, recently made a statement to the press, saying that Chinese diplomacy has always adopted the policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians" and "befriending distant states and attacking nearby ones." Therefore, Japan should automatically make the European and American countries understand Japan's position on China, and adopt a policy of exerting its strength, being outwardly calm and inwardly anxious.</p>
<p>The so-called policy of being outwardly calm and inwardly anxious is Foreign Minister Hirota's "duck diplomacy"—appearing calm on the surface while secretly and rapidly advancing. Their policy has always been consistent: striving to attack. But what is our government's policy? What good policies do we have to deal with this? We really do not know. However, one thing is certain: do not be deceived by the Japanese. They are working secretly, and we should work openly. We would rather suffer a clear loss than a hidden one.</p>
<h3>Firecrackers</h3>
<p>— Toya Tono</p>
<p>The south end of Dingjia Street is an open space. The withered yellow grass is spread flat on the ground, adorned with scattered firecracker skins, as if there is a hint of spring. A telephone pole stands upright in the open space, greeting the passing wind.</p>
<p>A group of children are chattering noisily on the grass, as if the New Year has set their hearts ablaze.</p>
<p>Little Jiu had just been beaten by his mother and ran out in anger. Seeing the joy of the group, he wiped his snot with his hand and squeezed into the crowd:</p>
<p>— Little Jinzi, come here!</p>
<p>Little Jinzi is about the same age as him: eight or nine years old. No, once the New Year arrives, he will be ten years old. His face is covered in dust, his eyes are wide open, and his eyebrows move mischievously. He turns around, sees Little Jiu, sees Little Jiu's snot, and wipes his hand on his cheek</p>
<p>— Shameless, you're dripping snot!</p>
<p>Little Jiu "hmphs" and sniffs. He asks who is setting off firecrackers here, his eyes still searching through the crowd.</p>
<p>— Come here, I'll tell you, — Little Jiu comes over — Do you have any money to buy firecrackers?</p>
<p>Little Jiu rolls his eyes, shakes his head, and whispers something into Little Jinzi's ear that only the two of them can hear. Little Jinzi laughs, the firecrackers sounding happily, as if deliberately showing off to him. He thinks for a moment and says:</p>
<p>— What if it doesn't work? He definitely won't be willing... he's a dog ×: allowed in but not allowed out!</p>
<p>When the two of them squeeze back into the crowd, their eyes are both fixed on the young master Jin, who is standing in the middle. He is not very tall to begin with, and a bit fat, making him seem even shorter and clumsier. He has small eyes and is holding a shoe box in his hand. The shoe box is full of valuable firecrackers, and he is holding a large handful of incense sticks, none of which are lit. He takes out a string of firecrackers, lights an incense stick, and hands it to his good buddy Fusheng, telling him to set them off while he listens. Fusheng is also clumsy, afraid but unable to avoid lighting the firecrackers, often thinking he has lit them and running away in fright. Young Master Jin takes his hands away from his ears and says with a simple smile:</p>
<p>— You're such a scaredy-cat, you don't dare to set them off!</p>
<p>Little Jinzi sees this as an opportunity, sidles over, and says:</p>
<p>— Hey, between brothers, who cares who sets them off, I'll set them off for you! He pats Fusheng's shoulder as he speaks. Fusheng looks at his face in surprise, and then feels humiliated, ignoring him and lighting his own firecrackers. Who knew one would hit Little Jiu's leg, Little Jiu takes a step forward, comes over, glares, puts his hands on his waist, gives Little Jinzi a wink, and kicks Fusheng with his leg:</p>
<p>— Have these gentlemen offended you? Hit these people!</p>
<p>Fusheng looks at Little Jiu even more timidly, like a sheep, not daring to move, but also unwilling to show weakness, and looks at Young Master Jin. Young Master Jin is waiting foolishly and idiotically, and when he sees him looking at him, he musters his courage and says:</p>
<p>— He's so unreasonable, he's clearly bullying people, you should just listen to him, why are you stirring up trouble?</p>
<p>— That's right, I'm setting off my firecrackers, you listen to yours, why are you looking for trouble...</p>
<p>These people are so good, hiring someone to set off firecrackers without spending money, and even having someone give them firecrackers!</p>
<p>The bystanders also want to watch the fun, some laugh gloatingly, some say sarcastic things, as if everyone is surrounded by spring. Little Jiu sniffs, pinches his nose, and hums:</p>
<p>Who's bullying you? You have to look at the owner when you beat a dog. Who are you? Stop talking nonsense, buddy, give us some to set off...</p>
<p>— Why should I...</p>
<p>Little Jinzi and Little Jiu's fists extend at the same time: Because of this. At the same time, they walk towards Young Master Jin, who looks at the two black, annoying fists, afraid that they will fall on him and dirty his robes, and runs away. But where can he run? There are people all around! He is grabbed by Little Jinzi at once, running around the telephone pole with Little Jinzi chasing him. Little Jiu tangles Fusheng so he can't come over to help. Young Master Jin runs with difficulty, shouting: "Fusheng, go call the family!" His face is red and he wants to sweat. He slips under his feet, not knowing what he has stumbled on, and "thump!" he falls on the grass like a cloth bag, chewing on the grass like a sheep. A large box of red, green, and flowered firecrackers are scattered all over the ground. Little Jinzi ignores Young Master Jin, opens his lapel? And puts them in by handfuls:</p>
<p>— Little Jiu, forget about him, come and pick them up! ...Mother ×, what are you snatching!</p>
<p>He grabs at the same time as the other children while shouting to Little Jiu. There is nothing left on the ground. Looking up, Young Master Jin has not gotten up, lying on the ground, sweat dripping from his face. He goes over and sits on him, saying:</p>
<p>— You wouldn't be a good person. If you had just given them, nothing would have happened. But, I ask you: are you afraid of me? Say! Are you afraid? How many generations are you afraid? ...No! ...At least a hundred generations! Also, what does your mother call who ×, say it, say "Little Jinzi ×"!</p>
<p>The surrounding people laugh and cheer. Little Jiu kneels on the ground with Fusheng's hands tied behind his back, kicks him in the back with one foot, "thwack" and Fusheng falls like a dead body, turning his head around.</p>
<p>Little Jinzi, let's go, let's set off firecrackers!</p>
<p>They had just left the lawn when they heard the Jin family yelling:</p>
<p>— Who is that bastard provoking the young master...</p>
<p>— Mother ×! These people! ...Let's go Little Jiu, let's go set them off!</p>
<p>Little Jinzi puts his arm on Little Jiu's back and walks away intimately.</p>
<h3>Assassination Case (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Ye Lai</p>
<p>"To hell with this, I really don't want to continue doing it anymore. There's only outgoing expenses and no incoming income. But how are you going to clear the accounts? This news cannot be spread. Once it's spread, all the debts will become a problem. It's very troublesome!"</p>
<p>"There's no savings left now either." Huang Jiaxing said, and thought for a moment: "We only have a little more than ten thousand here. You lost more than thirty thousand in the past. What should we do? We'll divide up all the more than ten thousand in the company, but you have to clear up the more than thirty thousand that you personally lost."</p>
<p>A Jun seemed to have been doused with a bucket of cold water. The words of Jiaxing were tying knots in his heart, going around in circles. After a while, the flames in his heart burned into those gray and tired eyes. He thought for a moment. He felt that if Jiaxing didn't take out the more than fifty thousand in cash in his hands to divide, it would be like being insulted and deceived by Jiaxing. He gritted his teeth and stared angrily at Jiaxing, who was still smiling.</p>
<p>However, Huang Jiaxing didn't seem to feel that A Jun hated him, and had suddenly become an enemy. He even smiled and said:</p>
<p>"Old Jun, aren't we going to clear things up immediately after we go bankrupt? After clearing things up, we'll distribute the money. The twenty to thirty thousand in my hands have already been lost, just like yours. Don't you believe me? Go ask Zhou Yun! He knows."</p>
<p>Jiaxing was still smiling, and glaring at him vigilantly. He roared like a mad lion wounded by a bullet:</p>
<p>"What nonsense are you talking about? There's still more than fifty thousand in your hands. As for me, I lost it for the company. It's not fair for you to do this. You cunning..."</p>
<p>Jiaxing was stunned by A Jun's roar. His head was full of accounts. He lowered his head, and couldn't help but become angry and listen:</p>
<p>"That's impossible. In short, you should first take back your losses before you speak."</p>
<p>In this way, the two men separated like silent, angrily trembling lions.</p>
<p>A few days later, the company closed its doors following rumors of a fight between A Jun and Jiaxing in the city. The entire city was stirred up by huge waves, and many related stores also went bankrupt.</p>
<p>However, during this period, one dark night, when Jiaxing was returning home from a smoking den, his life was ended by a few dark shadows flashing by.</p>

<h3>Lanterns</h3>
<p>— Leon</p>
<p>Over the past four or five years, my state of mind has clearly changed with the times. My interests and passions are always firmly suppressed by a heavy melancholy. What others might consider worthy of joy, I only feel with indifference. So, my friends all accuse me of being too pessimistic, and further determine that living like this will never allow me to find the true meaning of life. I admit that this determination is correct, and I have repeatedly had the urge—I want to revel, to enjoy as much as possible the things I once loved, even to rekindle the innocence of my childhood—but every attempt has always failed.</p>
<p>Currently, it is again the festive season for playing with lanterns. If I were still in my childhood, I don't know how much of a commotion I would cause? Recalling these things, they are still vividly alive as if they were happening right now. When I was nine or ten years old, every time this New Year's lantern festival came around, I would never let go of my dad. As soon as I put down my rice bowl, I would wipe my mouth and drag Dad to the City God Temple to buy lanterns. At that time, Dad's hair hadn't turned white yet, and his hands and feet were nimble. I held onto the hem of his sky-blue iron-woven silk gown, skipping and jumping as I walked with Dad along the cobblestone streets of the city. After walking a while, I would always steal a glance at Dad's face. He always had that smile on his face. The spring sunshine shone on his face, making his countenance and heart seem even more joyful. He would sometimes reach out and stroke my face. His hands were warm, so warm.</p>
<p>From the innocent little heart, a sense of gratitude would also seep out. "In the world, besides Mom, who is more kind and loving than Dad? I want to stick close to Mom and Dad all my life. I would rather not eat than let Mom and Dad leave me. Even if others buy me lanterns, I don't want them..." Wasn't that what I was thinking then? Although foolishly laughable, it came from the deepest feelings. Thinking about it now, a layer of gray and gloomy mist inevitably covers my heart, and my eyes become moist. Occasionally passing by the City God Temple, the grand scene of the lantern market, even in this year of disaster, is still no less than in those days. The styles and decorations of the lanterns are becoming more and more exquisite and beautiful due to the evolution of material civilization. However, these things can no longer have any relationship with me. Short-lived childhood slipped by like a water arrow, and who can tie it down? The living environment is sliding towards a downward direction, making it difficult to even grab some time to relax and breathe.</p>
<p>From now on, I can only stare at the light of the lanterns in the hands of the neighbor's children.</p>
<p>When I first entered the torrent of life, my Dad and Mom moved to the countryside to live. One reason was to reduce my burden of living, and the other was to return to their roots. Elderly people always have the calculations of elderly people. There are no parents in the world who don't love and care for their sons. In my childhood, I didn't want to leave Dad and Mom, and was even willing not to eat. But now, because I have to eat, I have to leave the two elderly people. Hehe, when will I be able to hold onto Dad's robe and go to the City God Temple to buy lanterns again? When will I be able to enjoy the warmth of Dad's hands again? My state of mind will never recover.</p>
<p>In this season of lanterns, I can only be an onlooker.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Chiba Soy Sauce Industry in Japan (4)</h3>

<h3>Storytelling with Musical Accompaniment</h3>
<p>Xu Wenbi's Opening</p>
<p>Shi Yin (1340) 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Yang Guifei's Regret"</p>
<p>Lonely Western Palace, painting resentment forever. After bathing in the hot springs, adding more fragrance. The imperial concubine sits alone on the agarwood couch, listening to the murmuring poetry of the Snow Robe Lady. Thinking that after she entered the palace and received favor, the emperor was overjoyed. Thinking that in the beginning, they swore a secret oath under the moon, the inlaid box and golden hairpin would never be forgotten. Wishing to be born together and die in the same tomb, her face like a flower, her clothes like clouds. Still remembering the sweet words in the Hall of Eternal Life, the Qingping Tune was composed in the palace. During that time, the beauties of the six palaces were colorless, leaving the favored Concubine Mei on the sidelines. Hating her eunuch Gao Lishi, who said that the emperor was not feeling well tonight. Therefore, lingering in the library, not allowing others to enter, quietly asking the concubine not to be alarmed. Yang Guifei was suspicious. The light knock of the copper ring revealed the spring light. Only knowing that the imperial bed was in a solemn palace, not knowing that Concubine Mei was serving the king. Who knew that the drums of Yuyang were connected to the sky, and the rebellion of Lushan disturbed Fanyang. Ge Shuhan was defeated by the vanguard rebels, and Tongguan was broken in panic. Suddenly, the Rainbow Skirt Song was broken, and the emperor fled to Western Shu through wind and frost. Thinking that things were rushed and helpless, Chen Yuanli was ordered to lead the six armies. Traveling to the foot of Mawei Mountain, the six armies were too rampant to move forward. Saying, alas, the dust-covered emperor has no master, and the jade is lost, and the fragrance disappears, and the heart is doubled in pain. Later, the sound of bells was heard in Jiange, breaking the intestines, and a song was even more bleak and cold in the rain. This hatred will last forever.</p>

<p>Opening "Visiting the Sick"</p>
<p>The moonlight is faint, the wind is light. The watchtower drum is ringing. The beautiful girl holds a lamp, and walks into the library of her resentful brother. Gently moving her steps and standing in front of the bed, picking up the curtains, and calling out to her cousin in a low voice. Sitting down, touching her chest. The beauty is re-walking, speaking her love. That day, hearing that you were sick, little sister was worried and could not relax. I, intended to serve you in person, only because your mother's family law is fierce. I'll have to wait until tonight when my mother goes to sleep, and I'll come to ask my brother. I want to ask you, why did you get this disease? Could it be because you used too much energy in the realm of lust? Talent listens. Laughs in the spring breeze. Cousin's words are not true, I am sick, but not seriously. Only because I took a walk in the cool air last night. I will surely recover in a few days, so I will not ask the doctor. Little sister listens. Her heart is relaxed. The sad guest instantly changes to joyful. Brother, I have the kindness to ask the doctor, to report that you will be relaxed as soon as you get sick. To treat you to a beautiful date and a rain and cloud.</p>

<p>Opening "Pearl Tower Pavilion Meeting"</p>
<p>The host and servant hurriedly stay. Chen Lian is, wiping his old eyes with happiness. Although seeing him, ragged clothes are embarrassing, but, his spirit is handsome and elegant, like a Jin man. Truly, he is an extraordinary person in the court, and he will soon be close to the emperor. He hates meeting so late, and speaks of the steps to advancement in a murmuring voice. Speaking of, the tears of deep gratitude are doubled. Not knowing, the Yue family's light ticket was wronged. I, was blocked by mountains and rivers again and again. Pitiful, my heart is sealed every day. Just rejoicing at the reunion of aunts and nephews, there is, flesh and blood like strangers. However, women's knowledge should be broad-minded. Fang Sheng is restrained and busy apologizing. Uncle, I am impolite to offend your dignity. Since childhood, I have lamented the loss of my father, one, looking at the white clouds and thinking of my relatives, one, the female willow is desolate and the hidden language is reverse. The hearts are connected.</p>
<h3>Radio Drama Script "Temptation"</h3>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>This drama was conceived by Tiehan Jun and written by Liu Yawei Jun. With the author's consent, it will be published daily. After the entire drama is published, it will be broadcast by the actors' broadcasting association. (The radio station has not been determined)</p>
<p>Scene 1: Driven out of the rural village by a flood mixed with hunger and cold. Time and place: a corner of a farm worker's area during a flood in a certain province in a certain year.</p>
<p>(Everyone sings the hoe song for about three minutes)</p>
<p>Old Zhang: (Calling from afar) Time to eat!</p>
<p>Little Lu: Big brother is calling us to eat, let's go, quickly pick up the hoes.</p>
<p>A Qiao: We're working so happily and now he's calling us to eat.</p>
<p>Little Lu: What? A Qiao, aren't you hungry?</p>
<p>A Qiao: Unless your stomach, Little Lu, is special, so you don't need to eat anything, my stomach can't do that!</p>
<p>Little Lu: A Qiao, you're always like a child, always talking upside down. When people call you to eat, you're not happy to go. When I ask you if you're hungry, you say you have to eat! What does that mean?</p>
<p>A Qiao: (Coyly laughs) Okay, you see, you told me to pick up the hoe, but why aren't you picking it up?</p>
<p>Little Lu: Forget it, let me carry both of them! (While jumping and crying) She's always so naughty~</p>
<p>Old Five (Shandong accent): Little Lu, you're always so happy, whenever I see you, I think of myself.</p>
<p>A Qiao (coyly laughing) Double Boy! (Runs away jumping)</p>
<p>Little Lu: Old Five, see you later.</p>
<p>Old Five: Don't go, don't go, let me say a few words to you, have you collected the rent for the fields?</p>
<p>Little Lu: They came to collect it, but these years, farming has been losing money, where do we get the money to give?</p>
<h3>Fine Arts</h3>
<p>Mao Zhizhong Fine Arts Training Class</p>
<p>Navigation Industry (1180) From 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM "Random Talks on Chinese Sculpture" Further development of writing, pictures almost exclusively became decorations, so the status of sculpture and paintings after the Song dynasty gradually diminished. (2) Teaching the Lower Volume of Western Painting Manual. (3) Chinese Artists.</p>
<p>Aftersounds</p>
<p>It is said that the advertising expenses of the Xinyi Society, organized by Yu Jialin, is still more than one hundred yuan and requires a subsidy of more than thirty yuan per month.</p>
<p>Present-day singers all like to jump from the sky into volcanoes to sing, just to show off for a while. Wang Manjie, who is praised as one of the three major singers, is also used by the Oriental Ballroom to attract customers. (Above by Mengying)</p>
<p>The bi-monthly "Songtan" (Singing World) magazine has a Q&amp;A section, which is said to be entirely self-answered.</p>
<p>Miss Zhou Manli of the Rose Troupe, her original name is Zhou Huijuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Yi performed at the Star Theater on Edward Road on Saturday night, but unfortunately did not perform on stage. On Sunday, he passed by Ba Xian Qiao with Miss Wang Manjie. (Above by Hua Wan)</p>
<p>The Beilei Choir is now rehearsing an opera and has given up its New New Radio program to the Fengyun Society for broadcasting.</p>
<p>Wang Kai, Ye Ying, Ye Hong, and others have now joined the Lianyi Society for broadcasting.</p>
<p>The Fengyun Society started broadcasting programs on the New New Radio yesterday. The gentlemen who visited were not as crowded as at the Tongle, and even some radio runners were nowhere to be seen, because to go to the radio station, one had to pass through the playground, and the ticket cost two big silver coins per person. (Black Water)</p>
<p>The Paris Art Society has no collaboration with the Beilei Society (Xinmin News Agency)</p>
<p>Yao Daguo, the violinist of the Furong Troupe, has been ranting on the radio these past few days about amateur singing groups. I wonder why? (Kuangliu)</p>
<p>The Lili Radio's machinery is damaged and has not been repaired yet. Therefore, the Rose Troupe's singing program, which is usually from 7:15 PM to 8:00 PM every afternoon, will be temporarily broadcast on the Oriental Radio from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM. Please pay attention, listeners. (Lang)</p>
<p>Film</p>
<h3>Colman's New Film "The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo" Will Be Released</h3>
<p>Since the film "Er Nü Ying Xiong" (Children of Heroes), the love saint Colman has not had a new film released for a long time. Recently, I heard that his new work "The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo" will be released at the Cathay Theater soon. The film is the latest production of 20th Century Fox, starring Joan Bennett. The film tells the story of a romance that occurred in Monte Carlo with a Russian royal family member. The plot is full of twists and turns, and the performance is both serious and humorous. Especially when depicting love, Colman has an amazing performance.</p>
