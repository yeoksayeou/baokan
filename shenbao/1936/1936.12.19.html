<p>日來蒙僞匪首乘西安事變的機會。積極收拾殘部。重圖大舉。十四日起。綏東前綫的匪機。不斷飛至國軍陣地與後方轟炸。同時南壕塹匪軍。帶同大批坦克車猛撲興和。雖經擊退。但是從戰事形勢看來。大規模的戰事。恐怕日內就要爆發了。</p>
<p>綏遠地勢控制西北。在兵略上固然是必爭之地。就是就全民族的經濟着眼。綏遠的存亡。也和民族的前途有莫大的關係。在這軍事緊張的時侯。全國民衆對於這一點。還須有明確的認識。請的略述之。</p>
<p>其一。黃河所經流域。在綏遠境內陰山以南。土地最爲肥沃。「黃河百害惟富一套。」早已遐邇咸知了。綏省因有這樣的地利。農產非常豐富。每年在綏東重鎭集寗匯集而行銷各地之糧食。總計不下百萬石。而且後套一帶是著名的墾殖區域。如今荒地甚多。據該省當局估計。目前該省可墾而未墾荒地。至少尙有一百五十萬頃以上。耕地以外。還有廣大的牧地。烏蘭察布盟和伊克昭盟的牧地。每年畜牧出產甚爲可驚。據塞北關統計。民國十八卑迄二十二年二月止。皮張出口價値三千萬元以上。羊駝毛出產也在二千五百萬斤左右。就此看來。綏省的農業富源。的確是不可忽視的。</p>
<p>其二。中國鐵礦大部份在東北及綏遠境內。東北現已淪入日人之手。而綏遠鐵礦則蘊藏豐富。正待開採。陶林包頭薩拉齊等縣的礦藏早經發現。西北科學考察團團員近年又在茂明安旗發現有十三萬六千九百餘萬噸產量的大鐵床。此外未被發現的鐵礦一定還有很多。綏遠不僅有無數的鐵礦。且有極豐富的煤田。無疑的綏遠應該是未來中國鋼鐵工業的中心。</p>
<p>俄國在革命初期。因受列强的環攻。尤其是德國軍隊的脅逼。京城動搖。士兵厭戰。當時列寗對他的黨徒說過。在萬分危急時。可以退到鳥拉爾堪察加去。這話的用意。一則是在保護自己的幹部力量。免受無謂的犧牲。二則退到煤鐵埋藏最多的烏拉爾方面。可以建設起重工業來。在他看來。只有如此。始能復興他們的國家和經濟。我們假如眞要引用歷史敎訓的話。那末爲了民族的百年大計。我們的烏拉爾决不在雲貴而是在綏遠。</p>
<p>綏遠因有平綏鐵路橫斷中部。甘新秦晉等地的土貨。大部份須經此轉運天津出口。而且晉綏經濟歷來是不可分離的。綏遠若有差池。晉省卽使單就經濟上來說。也非受到致命的打擊不可。</p>
<p>綏遠地位的重要性。旣如上述。全國同胞必須再接再厲。盡力援助守土抗戰的前敵戰士。使這民族經濟命脈所在地得以確保。否則民族前途。一定是很可悲觀的。</p>

<h3 id="c90">中日交涉停頓後　日本對華外交的新認識 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>十二月十日正午，日本外務省又發表「對華政策宣言了。這宣言的主要內容是：</p>
<p>（一）强調帝國的確固不動的「對華政策」。</p>
<p>（二）决定保護在華日人牛命財產的最高方針</p>
<p>（三）關於過去的交涉，列舉中國政府已經「內諾」的種種事實。駁醫中國方面所稱的中日意見不一致。</p>
<p>我們所能見到的，只有日本報紙上發表過的文字，所以也就只能根據日本各家報紙的記載來推測。</p>
<p>日本方面所稱的「中日意見一致」，據東京讀賣新聞看來，卽「關稅减低」，「聘請日本顧問」，「中日交通聯絡」，及「排日取締」等問題的意見一致。（中國方面所稱的不一致，因本文的目的在專講日本方面，恕不涉及。）但，日本旣稱意見一致了，那麼，對於所謂意見已經一致的諸問題，當然已失却其問題性。現在所應該注意的，只在日本今後如何强迫中國實行。在強迫實行的一點上，卽是今後的嚴重問題。</p>
<p>所謂保護在華日人生命財產的最高方針，卽是兵力行使」的「實力主義」。日本三相會議（寺內陸相。永野海相。有田外相）曾發表過以下的結論「關於在華利益及在華日人保護的根本方針，只有依靠帝國軍隊的武力。……此次帝國海軍陸戰隊在靑島登陸，卽預防措置的實例之一。……今後的對華政策，决行重大轉換，一掃從來的消極態度，轉向積極政策。……」看這結論已經很明白，用不着中國人再加估量了。靑島出兵，固爲實例之一。十二月六日，僞滿聲明援助內蒙軍，也何嘗不是實例之一。此種實例，今後是隨時可以見到的。</p>
<p>至於所謂帝國對華政策，那從來就是確固不動的了，現在不過是再强調一下吧。甚麼是對華政策呢？那卽是人人皆知的「大陸政策」。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>在中日交涉的三個月內，每當一次討價還價的波浪發生時，日本軍部便卽表示一次「强硬態度」，「重大决議」，好像束亞的火藥庫就要爆發了似的。這一火藥庫原操在日本軍部的手裏，爲甚麼直到今日，還只在火藥庫門外放大砲呢？是否因爲大陸政策發生動搖了呢？不是！日本統治階級很明白，子彈火藥都得要錢買，便是成爲戰勝國也不免要有多少犧牲的，只恫嚇恫嚇便可以得到實際的利益，那麼，先用大砲接在外交官的喉嚨上去恫嚇，這是最便當不過的了。滿洲已征服了五年，但對於今日僅存的幾隊義勇軍，也還不能不犧牲着日本很大的財力與生命。要征服中國全士，那犧牲的浩大就更不用說了，所以不能不多多愼重。</p>
<p>此種慎重，問題不在火藥庫的應吾爆炸？成爲問題的只是爆炸的時機。决定這一爆炸時機的，是日本今日所處的國際環境及日本的國內現狀。</p>
<p>今日的日本國際環境，自「日德協定」發表後，顯然的發生了以下的變化：</p>
<p>（一）日本已公開宣言，加入國際反共陣綫了。毫無疑義的，今後的日俄對立必更加尖銳化了。歐洲的反共戰錢，以莫索里尼和希特勒爲盟主。此德意盟主今日能够領導的反共勢力，有奧，匈，及西班牙的叛軍等。不用說，那卽是法西斯的國際反共戰綫。同時，俄法所領導的反法西斯國際陣綫上，却有捷克，波蘭，和西班牙人民政府等。日本卽利用希特勒及其同一陣綫上的勢力，威脅蘇聯，使蘇聯不能不分出較大的兵力，防衛西部國境，這樣一來，在對蘇作戰的計劃上，是很有利的。但，能否擊潰蘇聯，現在是沒有把握的，主要目的是在牽制蘇聯，同時完成大陸政策。在完成大陸政策的過程中，同時也就是强化對蘇的作戰準備。這一準備過程，使日本成爲法西斯陣綫上的最重要的一環了。但是—</p>
<p>（二）英美等國也在嘲笑着這一環。這嘲笑，當然是由帝國主義間的矛盾上發出來的。然而日本的外交孤立感，因此也就不曾减輕了多少。</p>
<p>（三）日本極欲將中國變爲他這環內的一環。但，中國政府已經聲明：「反共爲國內問題」。表示不願參加了。同時，中國的民族獨立鬥爭運動正在發展，這恰恰是與日本大陸政策針鋒相對的。有日本大陸政策的實現，就沒有中國民族的獨立。有中國民族的獨立，就沒有日本大陸政策的存在。這矛盾比帝國主義間的矛盾强多了。日本要中國政府參加反共，但不能放棄大陸政策。中國政府若放棄民族獨立鬥爭，卽失去國家獨立自由的資格。這就很够日本當局絞腦筋了。假使中國民族爲爭取本身的獨立自由，竟與蘇聯同盟。由中國內部的力量，與蘇聯（那怕蘇聯只能分出二分之一或三分之一的國力來）聯合起來，對日作戰。那麼，日本怎樣應付呢？這就是日本苦心焦慮的中心點。</p>
<p>由希特勒的演說知道希特勒一面在想防止德國境內的赤化運動，一面在想奪取蘇聯的烏克蘭農塲。日本想取得蘇聯的甚麼地方呢？日本還沒有此種演說。但所謂「日滿不可分」的「滿洲國」，已經成立四年了。華北問題等等也還在鬧着。僅僅爲完成日本的大陸政策僅僅爲反共，中國能願意放棄民族獨立鬥爭嗎？希特動肯拼命一戰嗎？這都是日本所必須考慮的。</p>

<p>告市民書</p>
<p>該會爲喚起市民注意起見、特發表吿市民書云、親愛的市民們、現代的國家、是建築在集團生活的基礎上的、現代的社會、必須人人能勞動、爲社會服務、爲社會謀福利、如果個人祇爲自己的飽暖、自私自利、爲自己的榮華富貴着想、那末社會就不能前進、公共的道德、因此墮落、國家决不會富强繁盛的、所以蔣委員長說、「我們要做一僩現代的國民、要成功現代的事業、就是要勞動、」我們的勞動、要他有意義、那末必須在自已做好自己本身的事情之外、更要做有益於國家社會的事情、我們要爲社會國家而服務、然後新的國家社會才能够建設起來、勞動服務的意義、就是在人人爲地方服務、人人有爲地方服務的義務、而從事於國民的經濟建設、實行勞動服務、就是國民經濟建設的一個最急要的辦法、也就是走上新社會新國家的一個重要階段、自從新生活運動倡導以來、已經有兩年了、兩年之內、新生活運動、已遍及於全國各地、影響所及、社會風尚、均爲之一振、同時勞動服務就使我們知道、是建設一個新社會新國家的最好方法、現在各地新築的公路、新開的河流、新造的森林、如加統計、眞不知有多少、而這麼多的新建設、都是勞動服務的結果、其直接間接增進社會的福利、助長國民經濟建設、他的力量、實在是很偉大的、上海市居全國一切的中心、市民衆多、百業降盛、但是接近都市的鄕區、遠有着許多工作、如開浚河流、築造公路、與修堤塘等、需要市民的勞力建起來、所以我們就從現在起、决定先在高橋·高行·睦行·江灣·真茹·引翔·殷行·蒲淞·吳淞·漕涇·等十區內·由十八歲到四十歲的市內男丁、一起出動、疏竣在社會發展上所需的河渠、勞動服務的辦法、已經公布、工作的計劃、也已經决定、市民們、大概還記得在二年之前、本市會經遭受了一次廳重的旱災、旱災的發生、雖然由於雨量缺少、但其主因、還是爲着本市各區的河流淤塞、灌漑不便、以致影響了農產的收穫、如果那時我們能把水利辦得很好、那末旱災就不會那麼嚴重、這可見疏浚河流、是一件很重要的事了、而且勤儉勞動、本是人生一種良好的美德、同時又可以堆進身體的健康、這個我們可以在歷史上找到很多例子、如陶侃搬磚等等、所以我們認爲如今大家來勞動服務、一面是助長了社會的建設和福利、另一面也是對於本身有益的事、親愛的市民們、我們一致起來吧、拿着剷鋤踿鈀、大家同來勞動服務、爲國家、爲社會、爲我們自身的福利、向前奮鬥、</p>

<h3 id="c205">青春的永久與暫時 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 膽星</p>
<p>人生無以爲寳，惟靑春足以爲寳。靑春是人人有的，惟能利用靑春，不辜負靑春，永駐靑春的人，才算是超人，才算是充實的人生。女子的靑春時期，更屬一生中的重要階段。在這階段裏，確定了畢生幸福與厄運，决斷了前途寬曠與狹窄。所謂永駐靑春，並非呌女子們終身塗脂抹粉，穿時髦衣服，這人工與物質的駐顏術是無補於事的。我們偶然瞧見一個燙頭髮，點口紅的老太太，不是要認爲滑稽而可笑的嗎！</p>
<p>世上旣沒有所謂神仙，便沒有使年齡不長進，容顏不衰老的法術，所以，顯現在年齡及身面上的靑春，是暫時的。永久的靑春是留存在愉快的精神中，留存在充實的生活中。你的內心，你的環境，互相應合，而感到靑春沒有消滅時一般的欣榮，快慰，雖然年齡已屆中年或暮境，或將至於死。</p>
<p>年靑的女子正像一枝初生的蓓蕾，充溢着火般的生命力，欣欣向榮。但是，脆弱的嫩枝應該格外當心它的生發的，卽使極輕微的摧折亦經不起。須要在溫和的陽光下，豐潤的雨露中，使靑春滋長。可是許多自命聰敏的女子，太會賣弄靑春了。往往把這個偉大的，純潔的，寳貴的時期浸沉在緋紅色的夢裏，結果所獲的是什麼？除掉失望，悲哀，苦悶，怨尤，消極，悔恨……以外，祗是一個空洞的夢的憧憬而已。於是伊們感覺到婚姻與愛的失望後，便把一切罪惡和遭際，一古腦兒推給社會，反說社會欺悔了伊們。</p>
<p>假使每個女子能在靑春時期，用理智去克服情威的衝動，用鎮靜而複雜的思想，用嚴肅而端莊的態度，用遠大而精銳的眼光，用不求急功而穩重的步序，去解决自己理想中的事業與婚姻。必能永久使你獲得靑春般的幸福，雖然，實際的靑春已全部供獻，消耗在你的婚姻和事業上。精神的靑春是永久不會消滅的。然則，曇花似的愉快和幸福又値得什麼呢！</p>
<p>請別留戀那未成熟的果子吧，當你嚐到苦澀而酸的滋味，就懊悔莫及。靑春像特快列車飛駛在生之軌道上，一不留意，便會錯過你的站頭的，那麼，這决不是做緋紅色的夢的時候了。</p>

<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>綏遠的抗戰早展開了，現在某方正催迫着賣國的漢奸，進攻我國防最前綫的——綏遠，幸有我忠勇的傅作義將軍，率領部下健兒，和敵人浴血應戰，站在後方的我們，旣不能同往前綫去奮身殺敵，像阿比西尼亞的婦女一樣，那當然我們任何人，便應該爲國家，爲民族盡一分力量，表示一些愛國的熱忱。我這裏向二萬萬女同胞！報吿一個値得我們效法的好消息：</p>
<p>據本報十二月一日的厦門通信，上月二十五日晨，有一女子在江聲報門前伺立讀張貼的報紙，約半小時，立入該社脫下所御金戒指，請該報社代爲變賣，得欵代寄綏遠，以慰最前錢的抗敵將士，但道女子不吿姓名，收條僅書無名氏，於是該報社當將該戒指持赴銀樓估値七元，再特登報宜稱公開出售，後來相繼有吳坡塘者，願以十四元承購，厦禾汽車公司經理傅微閣者，持二十元去購，贈其夫人，還有章氏小兄妹五人，章國梅，章家梅，章憶維，章丘梅，章恒維，願將平日所積蓄的糖菓費二十八元，去購無名女士的戒指，以上各位先生，各位女士，都是熱烈援綏的愛國同志，並目章氏兄妹，若有人肯出更高的價錢，也願出讓，傅先生已讓給章姓兄妹，也不收回二十元，希望多得一些，使前方將士多一點援助。</p>
<p>諸位親愛的女同胞！你們看了厦鬥無名氏女士，脫下金戒指援綏的事，作何表示？喂！記得前幾時，意大利的婦女，不是有金戒指救國嗎？那麼，我們好了！好了！趕快把首飾捐給政府，作爲充實國防，並且前期本刊華胥女士，也請諸位將化妝品，燙髮，裝飾品，娛樂等一切費用節省下來，去慰勞前方將士，這是我們應該提倡「余戒指救國」。或許這位無名氏女士，就是我們的創導者吧！願全國二萬萬的女同胞！參加「金戒指救國」運動，想必諸位一定樂於效法的啊！</p>
<h3 id="c207">日本汽車孃的生活 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日本汽車孃是日本女子職業中，最新盛行的。最初東京商辦汽車公司，僱用女子賣票之後，營業大盛。於是東京市營的汽車和電車，亦以汽車孃爲抵抗，到現在日本各地，莫不以汽車孃爲招攪。市營汽車的汽車孃都是市議會會員及社會事業家等介紹的，不能苛刻採擇。而商辦汽車公司是登報徵求的，可於五百餘人中，選擇二十名，故容貌，身段，健康都較市營的爲佳。內中有十分之一（六十餘人）都是高等女學畢業的。採用年齡自十六歲至十八歲，到二十五歲停職，市營的至三十五歲停職。</p>
<p>商辦汽車公司汽車孃的待遇每日五角五分，津貼三角五分，賣票酬勞爲千分之二十六。市營的每日八角，兩方每月約在三十元左右，最高可加至五十元。工作時間約八十時，每八日得休息一日。年輕的汽車孃終日和異性的車夫和乘客交接着，難免要引起了靑春的煩悶，而造成香艷事件。於是汽車公司便不准汽車孃住在車庫附近，並且車夫和賣票，也是輪流調動着，以防過於熟識。一方面監督者又化裝乘客防止着。汽車孃工作完了之後，必須到車庫裏去洗澡，這目的不是在洗身體，可以說是檢查衣服裏是否夾帶銀錢罷了。每一處營業所，都有兩個中年婦人，稱爲「檢會塲的先生」，伊不但操着汽車孃的生殺之權，並且有時要兼做汽車孃的婚姻介紹人。因爲乘客熱戀了汽車孃之後，常要到營業所來求婚的，於是「檢查塲的先生」便成了月下老人。</p>
<p>商辦汽車公司開着一所明德女學，凡是休假的汽車孃，便得免費入學，敎授家政裁縫，作法，國語，習字等科。市營的各營業也都有生花敎授的，這樣日本汽車鑲的生活是被公司支配完全了。凡是乘客較多的地方，汽車公司又派了服務孃招待旅客，全東京有三十餘人，伊們是汽車中，挑選出來的最漂亮的標準者，至少帶有廣吿色彩。嬝嬝婷婷的立在東京街頭，招呼着乘客，是汽車公司最新發明的戰術。</p>
<p>市營公司汽車孃的制服，是藏靑色的洋裝，短衣長裙，十分配身，每套價十五元。市營公司連忙仿造，但是因爲價値僅五六元的現成貨。七大八小，把幾個汽車孃恨得怨聲載道。日本汽車孃是最喜歡裝飾的，兩只手握着票夾錢袋剪刀之外，還得顧着自己的帽子和衣角。朱唇黛眉，幾聲淸脆的地名，和穿着高跟皮鞋及汽車中顚動時的身段，不知要顚倒了多少乘客呢。</p>

<p>— （火谷）</p>
<p>婦女們，你們在家庭裏，都是佔有重要地位的，你們的一舉一動，直接能影響家庭，間接的可以影響到社會，國家，所以你們的舉止行動，是應該怎樣的留意啊，現在請你們幹一伴輕而易舉的事，就是省下生火爐的錢，來捐給在綏遠奮勇抗敵的戰士們。</p>
<p>生火爐，在冬天，差不多是中等以上的家庭，所以少不了的一件事了，目的當然是取暖，但是在現在這樣的局面下，只要一想到在冰天雪地中浴血抗戰的勇士們，我們在後方，還要生着火爐取暖，自己也有點兒說不過去吧</p>
<p>諸位都是前進的婦女，想必總能容我這些微的要求。</p>

<p>預知毒氣來襲之朕兆與避免毒氣之方法：</p>
<p>（一）戰地附近的入民，忽嗅得異樣氣味時，就要提防毒氣來襲了。</p>
<p>（二）戰地附近的人民，忽見瀰天大霧時，就要提防毒氣來襲了。</p>
<p>（三）戰地附扳的人民，忽聽得連續不斷的巨聲時，就要提防毒氣來襲了。</p>
<p>（四）家中花卉草木，突然枯黃凋謝時，就要提防毒氣來襲了。</p>
<p>（五）街道上犬，雞，小畜類突然倒斃時，就要提防毒氣來襲了。</p>
<p>（六）狂風大雨的時候，不必担憂，夜靜風淸，且風從敵方來，正是敵人放毒的好機會。</p>
<p>（七）毒氣都比空氣重，專往低下的地方流注，所以毒氣來襲時，往地窖·地室內藏躱是不合理的，須快尋高處躱避，屋頂·高樹·高塔·瞭望臺·山頂都比較安全一點。</p>
<p>（八）在野外受到毒氣的攻擊，停滯不動，是不合理的，須用濕布掩住口鼻，迎風飛跑，或者可以逃出毒氣的範圍。</p>
<p>（九）在屋內受到毒氣的攻襲時，開門窗去探望，是不合理的，須趕快將門窗緊閉，漏氣的地方，都將濕紙布塞住，如室內已有毒氣，可將預備好的鹼性藥水溶液，大蘇打水等，用噴壺噴射，或含在口內噴散，以消滅空氣中的毒氣。</p>
<p>（十）住宅受毒氣包圍時，僅將門窗關閉，是不合理的，須將各房門重重關閉，如有人出進，每開一門，就用噴射防毒藥水來救護，出進後，須立昨緊閉。</p>
<h3 id="c211">主婦必備的常識煤毒的預防和急救 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>天氣是寒冷了！一般人家裏，都燃起爐子了，有錢的人家，自然是洋爐子了，差不多的人家，爲着經濟的限制，祗好燒煤球取暖。可是根據着我們過去的經騐，每年被煤氣薰窒致死的，實在是不少，所以我是在這裏忠吿主婦們，對於燃用煤球，必須要特別注意，以免發生不幸的事件。現在寫點關於燃燒煤球，必須注意的幾點，和不幸被煤氣薰窒的急救方法，這也可以說是主婦們必備的常識。</p>
<p>燒煤球最好在外面燃着，等煤氣去了以後，再移到房間裏來。並且房間內的窗戶，須要透氣，萬不可關得嚴密。睡覺的時候，要搬到外面去，否則，房間內要放一盆凉水，因爲冷水是可以吸收煤氣的。但是我總以爲搬到屋外最爲妥當。</p>
<p>假使有人被煤氣薰窒了的話，要立刻把這人抬到空氣流動的地方，使他仰臥着，一面把他的衣服解了開來。用醃鹹菜的鹹菜滷灌他。這鹹菜滷是越陳越好，用來灌被煤薰的人，是非常有效騐的，同時，再找醫生來診治，要是離醫生過遠的地方，可以先施人工呼吸法，使他呼吸能够遂漸恢復，總可以救過來的。除了被薰的時間太久的以外。總而言之，遇到這種不幸的事件，千萬不可慌亂，必須趕緊的想法去找鹹菜滷：作人工呼吸，速請醫士；如果延誤工夫，那就有點難救了。！</p>
<p>女傭們常歡喜把煤球爐子偷移到臥室裏去。有的更因爲怕冷的緣故，在臨睡之前加上幾個煤球，這是最危險的一件事，被煤氣薰窒的人，大半是這樣的。所以作主婦的對於女傭們少須嚴加誥誡，詳細解釋，更時常的加以查看以免小幸的事件發生</p>

<h3 id="c213">供獻給做丈夫們的幾句話 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 金靈</p>
<p>展開十月三十一日的報紙，讀過一遍蔣委員長發表的「五十生日感言：」立刻在腦海中湧現出許多的感想，覺得一個做母親者的實任，是如何的重大，在現今的社會上，講男女平等，事實上還沒有辦到，可是我們絕不該因了歷代傳下來的重男輕女的惡習慣，而發生消極悲觀的心理，自甘墮落</p>
<p>日前在某友人處聚談，大家都報吿些自己家庭內的生活狀况，和自己丈夫的爲人如何？談講之下，有眉飛色舞的，也有些平淡無奇的，輪到了C女士，她就緊鎖了雙眉，大有不勝悲切的樣子！她的情形，我很熟悉：她是一個受過較好敎育的女子，結婚到今，有五年半之久，但是她已快當第五個孩子的母親了，她的丈夫在某地工作，他倆相處的時日很少，她丈夫也是受過相當敎育的人，口裏喊着的口號是：「維新」：是「革命」。其實是滿腹的腐朽思想，性情固執不通，每年只不過回家三四次，對於這個溫順而耐勞的妻子，沒有安慰，也說不上什麼情感，他只當他的妻子是一個奴僕般的看待，開口老是說一些刺人心痛的話：「女人？女人有什麼用？除了供給男人當做享樂品之外。」又嫌厭她孩子生多了，失去了女人的美，沒有了曲錢，沒有了嬌媚，沒有了一切。一個二十六七歲的人，在他的眼光中看去，已經不知衰老到怎樣的程度了，所以常是埋怨她；厭惡她；處在這種境况之下的C，她還有什麼人生樂趣？還有什麼前進的勇氣和光明的希望？她一直的爲了孩子們辛苦，撫育已生的孩子，保養未產的胎兒，在經濟不甚寬裕的家庭中，她竭力的節省，有條不紊的料理着家務，因爲過度的生育，的確使她失去了當年的健康，她在百般辛勞之餘，希望得些丈夫的安慰，就和枯枝之等待灌溉一般；然而她得到的結果是些什麼呢？辛酸的眼涙；悲憤的感覺；她的遭遇，幾乎使她下了自殺的决心；但是回頭看看，這羣嗷嗷待哺的孩子，又那裏忍心走上這條末路呢？我在同情她的痛苦之餘，也曾常常勸她：「各人有各人的責任，無論處到怎樣難堪的境地，也要忍耐一下的，敎養這羣孩子的責任太重大了，不該爲他一個人而去犧牲自己的生命，拋棄自己做「人」的任務。」</p>
<p>寫到此，我就有幾句話要貢獻給一般做丈夫的先生們：一個和睦的家庭，不單是因做妻于一方面的溫順，馴服，恪守貞操，不越雷池一步就可造成功的，做丈夫的也該遵守着爲人應有的道德，不可擅發夫威，見兇悍的女人就自然的屈服下去，遇溫順者，則白般欺凌，我行我素，不顧一切，以爲在男權中心的時代，女人的地位，根本算不得一回什麼，做妻子的，當然也有應該遵守的條件。「齊家，治國，平天下，」家就是社會的基礎，妻子負着理家與敎養子女的重責，並非兒戲的事，丈夫應該鼓勵妻子，安慰她，使她安心的下全力爲了家務努力，纔是正理，不容抱那種自輕輕人的心理，在家內橫蠻的，誇大的，執行着無理的夫權。夫妻間互敬互愛，能如此，家庭中不是就可以减却許多的缺憾了嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c214">現代職業婦女所受的迫害（下） <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 李守眞</p>
<p>其次如一般學校裏的女敎員，機關的女職員，以及各種職業部門的女子辦事人員，常常她們不能就自己的能力做比較要緊的工作。在一個機關裏同樣地位的兩個職員，上面交下來的工作，總是給男職員的比給女職員的重些，這難道是對於女子的特殊恩惠嗎？這不過是輕視女子能力的一種侮辱或壓制女子發展的一種手段罷了。他們的用女職員不是處於使用人材的立塲上，而是用女職員來作個點綴而已，人們侮衊各機關的女職員是花瓶，難道是女子自己甘願做個花瓶的嗎？不過是一班無聊的男子們用他們的卑劣的心理來侮辱女子就是了。</p>
<p>更壞的是當一個有思想有頭腦的靑年女子才踏上了社會之門，就接到了東一封情書，西一個請求，束一個無聊的糾纏，西一個無恥的笑臉：有意志的是終日奮鬥，終是憤怒，想用盡方法來消滅這些勾當，因此對於自己的事業，却不能迅速前進，對自己的前途，也難得很快發展。而比較意志薄弱一點的呢？終於不勝其擾而妥恊，於是一班男子們却又呌着女子沒有用的，罵着女子的墮落，並且以此而誣害女子求事求業的目的，這樣許多許多的父兄，以此來壓制他們的女兒姊妹，而他們又誣害人家的女兒姊妹，使她們的父兄也同樣的來壓制她們</p>
<p>這樣我們可以看見現代婦女所受到的待遇，以及社會上對於職業婦女的鄙卑殘酷了。</p>
<p>現在希望我們的女同胞們，深深地瞭解自己所處的地位和自己的人格，自己拿出勇氣和毅力，只要我們能認識這一點，我們是個人，那麼我們就不能因他人對我們的迫害而自甘退却，而不盡做人的義務，外界對我們的壓力愈强，我們反抗力也應該愈大，我們不要拿那些迫害的事實當作了不起的壓力，我們應該看看那些少數的，從嚴重的壓迫之下奮鬥出來的同胞，只要我們有决心，有勇氣，不受入們的虛僞的施與，自己有一分能力，做一分工作，得一分利益，人們旣失了他悔辱的機會，也沒有了誣蔑的藉口，縱然他們要如何的壓服我們，也是不可能的，女同胞們！决不要屈服，不要妥協，不要退讓，社會有一天會發覺他們過去之陷害女子，是多麼的愚蠢和非人性，覺悟到互相尊重，互相帮助，才是人類有的德行！</p>

<p>這一晚紹宜到家已是九點三刻模樣了，伊爸爸正在樓下沙發上獨自坐着，似乎一心在等候伊回來；紹宜自從那一晚跟伊爸爸爭辯過之後，還不會和他好好地說過話，雖見面只呌一聲就算了。這時候樓下客廳裏旣沒有第三個人，伊爸爸便忍不住先發話了：</p>
<p>「你要做事情，我當然很造成，可是你們女孩子比不得男孩子，找一個職業也得仔細些才行。你現在空間在什么人那裏辦事啊？」</p>
<p>紹宜對於這一問當然不能再不睬，便約略說了幾句，非但沒有直說那姓□的人如何請伊看戲，如何請伊吃飯，便是一個屋子裏祇有兩個人坐在裏面的話也不曾提起。伊爸爸聽是一個雜　社，倒放下了許多的心，只用着他那慣用的倚老賣老的口吻補充了幾句，無非是敎伊早些回家，不要隨便和人家交際，服飾要節儉之類的老話。</p>
<p>當紹宜一個人在床上休息的時候，祇覺得腦海裏在起伏着的全是從前所不曾有過的許多奇異的思潮：而這些思潮的中心，竟老是那姓□的人；雖然爸爸的話還在伊的耳鼓上響著，但力量是非常的微薄，伊不相信這樣因職務而發生的交際，會有什么重大的結果。伊對於那姓□的人的奇怪的態度很諒解，以爲這是雇主們對待一個私人秘書所常有的禮遇，目的是在激發伊的忠於職務的心理。</p>
<p>第三天，在那佈置過於富麗的新月雜誌社裏，那姓□的人果然就告訴伊，他希望伊能夠給他保守一切業務上，著作上，以及交際上的種種秘密，同時更專心於伊的工作；他將長期的優待着伊，並且過三個月就可以增加伊的薪水。這樣是使紹宜最初所懷着的一些疑心也消失了，並且當天下午他還鄭重其事的敎紹宜寫了三封英文信，正式開始工作起來。</p>
<p>私人秘書的工作很順利地進行着，紹宜所受的種種禮遇也日益增厚了，他在正當的月薪以外，又送伊衣料，手套，手錶等等，差不多超過了薪額五倍十倍；但紹宜是一些不覺得奇怪了，伊漸漸發生了一種「私人秘書」便是一個最親密的朋友的錯覺，所以伊認爲保蓉——就是那姓□的人——是應該這樣對待伊的，伊也應該這樣享受的。</p>
<p>一個月，兩個月，很快的過去了，雖然伊爸爸已因伊的服飾和舉止上發生了許多疑點，曾經幾决盤問過伊；可是伊却儘把種種虛話來搪塞，極忠實地給伊雇主牢守着一切的秘密。爸爸沒有辦法，祗得很生氣地感嘆了一會。</p>
<p>後來，私人秘書便是一個最親密的朋友的錯覺又演化爲一個私人秘書便是一個秘密的情人的事實了，紹宜覺得保蓉眞是待伊太好了，單是給他辦事實在還不够報答他、於是便把他所要求的種種安慰全給予了他；而保蓉的經濟又是極可異的寬裕，費不掉多少力，便把新月雜誌社遷移到愚園路去，擴大爲一所絕端現代化的新家庭，公然和他的私人秘書同居起來了。</p>
<p>事已如此，紹宜的爸爸也不能再苛責了，便提出了一個很簡單的要求，就是限他們趕快補行婚禮；紹宜把這個意思一再催促保蓉，但保蓉却一味的敷衍着，並且還在無意中露出了不少已另有「髮妻」的破綻來。紹宜想起伊爸爸從前盤問伊的許多話以及伊自己所說的種種謊話，實在覺得沒有臉再去吿訴爸爸，祇能竭力隱忍着，直到伊的第一個兒子在醫院裏出世，伊對於保蓉，對合法的名義還是一個「私人秘書」。</p>

<h3 id="c216">九華山幽冥鐘 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 汶</p>
<p>從報紙上看到很闊的一行廣吿，九華山頂幽冥鐘，將於十二月三十日阿彌陀佛聖誕日開鑄了。這是我國唯一巨大的鐘。籌備時間，聞說已有二三年，重量在十噸以上，敲時可聲聞百里內外云。我國事事落他人之後，今有此巨鐘，在國際間也可稱得一個「最」字，以與美國之好稱「第一」相比，實並無愧色矣，那得不稱爲國家盛事！</p>
<p>嘗考幽冥鐘之作用，是在以宏大鐘聲，驚起九泉之芸芸羣鬼，迅速猛省，回頭是岸，超登彼西方之極樂世界。我鄉婦女有因生產而亡故者，共丈夫或是子女，必請寺院敲此鐘七晝夜，據說不如此則死鬼必永墮「血汚池」中，不得超生云。敲時在鐘下置一大油缸，以燈芯草點火，漂浮油上，上懸紙紮女人一個，披頭散髮，狀極可怕。看油火忽明忽暗，聽鐘聲幽幽然，身臨其境，慄慄然眞覺如到幽冥世界了。此外，也就沒有看見爲其他的事情敲過。寺院的置備幽冥鐘，似乎專爲警醒因生產而亡故的在九泉下的女性用的。現在國內諸大善士，佛門弟子，特發宏願，在九華山頂，鑄此巨鐘，其意義常然又是不同了。</p>
<p>屈指算一算，近十年來，我國人民死於內戰者有幾？死於敵人殘殺之下者有幾？死於水旱災荒者有幾？而不明不白，死於黑暗的屠殺中者又有若千人？地獄若眞有的話，恐地獄亦爲之客滿了。聚此芸芸羣鬼，在鬼門關中，必不會十分安分的。閻王若也眞有的話，恐將有難治之嘆。今有巨鐘一口，以其宏大鐘聲，幽幽然直達於地下，羣鬼必聞而骨軟筋酥。閻王於是乃得從容發遣曰：「其各前往極樂世界，毋得逗留此間，造是生非」！於是，鬼界乃得天下太平。</p>

<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>每回從那廣塲上經過，我常常能够看見一個奇異的老頭子。</p>
<p>他，身材只有三尺左右的高低，要不是他底背脊有點駝，遠遠看去你决不會相信他是五十近邊的人了。在小小的，積滿着皺紋的而上架着一副異於尋當的大眼鏡，一叢仁丹鬍子高高的嵌在唇</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>上。差不多是整年地，他都穿着同樣一套積滿着油垢和灰塵的燕尾服，戴着一頂高腰筒的禮帽，可是熱帶地域底高溫度，使他不得不常常戴上又脫下，另一隻手就拿着一根釘有鐵頭的小乎杖，昂着頭，挺起胸膛，嚴正地走着，像是去赴一些名流們底宴會似的。</p>
<p>在他底衰弱的，可笑的而上，常常洋溢着醇酒的紅暈，爲着他自己感到生活在岷里拉這樣地方，是像和在沙漠里一樣的枯燥，他常常喝着酒。可是，他却沒有忘記當遠遠發現了一個紳士模樣的人，從廣塲的一端迤邐過來時，連忙整着自己那件幾乎變成煤灰一樣焦黑的硬領，冒着滿頭熱汗，戴上高禮帽，裝着沒有那麼一回事似的，從相反的地方走去碰他。當他們底距離約到了二丈左右的時候，他就懇切地，嚴止地站在一旁，嘴角浮着微笑，拿手杖的那隻手，彎到背後去，另一隻手就伸去摘頭上的高禮帽，緊緊貼在胸膛前，行着一個九十度的鞠躬。</p>
<p>「紳士，早安」！</p>
<p>那個被稱爲紳士的，就要驚異得皺緊眉頭，他們往往會懷疑這個奇異的小老人，要不是喝醉了酒，就是想向他討幾個「把拉」的施捨，有些爲着避免麻煩，就往往伸手去掏腰包。但他决不會馬上就伸手接收過去，他要擺着非常有禮貌的神氣，策近他底面前，邊走邊絮絮叨叨的說着。</p>
<p>「先生你弄錯了，我不是那樣人。……」他用抱歉的聲調說着，表示自己雖然襤樓，也還是從高尙家庭出身的。「我其所以願意於和先生接近的，原有更神聖的原因。」接着，他輕輕的咳了一下，亢奮地把自己底手杖在地底下敲着。「我要的不是幾個把拉的施捨」他吞了一口涎水又說。「我要的就是想吿訴先生在岷里拉這枯燥的沙漠中，還有一朶奇麗的花朵，那就是莎麗姑娘。她，一個高尙的西班牙貴族與高尙的菲律濱血統的混合兒；爲着窮困，她開始接待她可敬愛的客人。先生，如果你不棄嫌的話，你可以花了最低廉的代價，和她談談或作其他有趣的事。……」</p>
<p>爲着興奮，他就滿面漲得通紅，霎着那雙給厚玻璃遮住的小眼睛，向客人看着。當他發覺了客人有點厭煩或想走開時，他就頻頻的點着頭，行着九十度鞠躬禮。</p>
<p>爲着好奇，或爲着這個老頭子可笑的樣子，大胆的紳士們就被引去會見他底一朵奇麗的花朵。」而他就要非常興奮的，談着各種逗人有趣的話，或者背誦似的叙述着自已光榮的過去。由此，誰都知道他也是高尙的西班牙貴族，和高尙的菲律濱血統底混合兒，那「一朶奇麗的花朶」就是他自己底親生女。</p>
<p>「從前在未西亞省」接若，他用傷感的聲調說道：「我們有一所値二十萬美金的椰園，但是，現在我什麼都沒有了，十五年前高等法院由了銀行的要求，宣佈我們破產。」</p>
<p>他們踏着禮日區，充滿了灰塵的小街道，彎彎曲曲的走過了約三四條馬路</p>

<p>— 老年人</p>
<p>「便宜沒好貨」，這是我們慣常聽見的一句話。「便宜」旣然沒有好貨，我們就不要貪「便宜」，尤其是藥物，吃便宜的藥物决難有好的效騐，也許還會發生不良的影響！就像現在應時的魚肝油，有秤小藥房用廉價來號召，但是這種廉價的雜牌魚肝油，製煉不精，調服有碍腸胃，幸勿上當！所以不買魚肝油則已，要買眞正好的魚肝油，還是去到五洲大藥房。因爲五洲本牌的乳白魚肝油，是用藍色反應法精密檢定，維他命含量豐富，五洲的地球牌麥精魚肝油，是用純淨的　魚肝油，和上等的麥精等合煉，味道甜美，所以社會最是信仰。</p>

<p>— 秀蘭</p>
<p>A先生和他的夫人愛情是很好的，有一天A先生的夫人在化裝以後，A先生立在她的身後，撫摸着她的頭髪說：</p>
<p>「你這烏雲般的青絲，</p>
<p>灑上「一三一」頭水，</p>
<p>微風吹送，</p>
<p>香澈肺腑！</p>
<p>我愛你鳥雲般的青絲，</p>
<p>我愛那「一三一」頭水。」</p>
<p>A先生的夫人聽見這些讚語，也快樂的笑了。</p>
<p>（按）國產高等香髪水，向來很少，一般愛用國貨的仕女們都引爲憾事，自從五洲大藥房的「一三一」香髪水問世以後，它的香氣比較最高的舶來品還要幽雅，所以現在仕女們差不多都採用這種香髮水了。</p>

<p>，就在一所地下室前停住，他奮勇的爬下扶梯，讓客人跟在後面，推進門去。</p>
<p>地下室里，只有一丈左右的一間狹長房間，四周給幾件簡單的傢具佈置着，有一個沙發床，一隻檯子，一個嵌着穿衣鏡的橱櫃，雖陰暗倒還整潔。老人進門時，就低聲地呌道：</p>
<p>「莎麗，親愛的，我替你把客人帶來了。……」</p>
<p>一個半裸體的年靑女人，肥胖而且短小的，像一粒皮球似的從沙發床上跳起來。</p>
<p>「這就是莎麗姑娘，一朶奇麗的花朶。……老頭子用感動的聲調介紹着，把客人底外套，手杖或帽子接過去，在橱櫃里放好，就客氣地行了一個鞠躬禮，退到門外，坐在一隻石階上，嘴里吸着香烟，頭低低的看到地底下，準備着聽見里面有什麼呌喊，便進去效勞。</p>
<p>半個鐘頭後，那一扇門輕輕的顫動了一下，開了，他就突然挨了一棍似的吃驚着，忙從石階上站立起來，退在一邊嚴肅地鞠了一躬，低低的說道：</p>
<p>「現在，紳士就請賞點酒錢。……」</p>
<p>不到一刻光景，他就在一家地下室酒排室里出現，一手拿着手杖，一手拿着高禮帽，頻頻的向在座的人點頭。</p>

<h3 id="c220">劉掌櫃 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>那是我住在東城的時候，認識了劉掌櫃。</p>
<p>他的年紀並不算很大，下顎的鬍子倒養了不短，輕飄飄地，他有「老少年」的活躍的情緒，時常會扮着鬼臉，在孩子發脾氣的當兒，引逗着他們笑，碰着機會凑巧，—所謂凑巧，是要在喝酒以後，也許他還會爬在北地特產的大坑上，讓孩子騎上了背脊，一面在背上喝嚒着，一面他的大屁股就會不住的左右擺動，像跳草裙舞一樣。</p>
<p>當然，還不止道麼一點，北方的大院子縱橫的面積是相當大的，太陽劃上了西面的山牆，院子里同居的孩子都分路的出動了，不如怎麼那時大家很歡喜捉迷藏，而執行被迷的人，是極其需要公正的，爲了這，他也會把大屁股輕巧的坐在石頭台上，代行着公正的職務。有一個時期，當捉迷藏玩得厭了，換上了「調龍頭」（又呌老鷹捉小鷄）爲了想保護龍頭後面的弱小生物，「頭」的地位却非常吃緊，這種角色，當然又非他莫屬了。</p>
<p>這一所有三進院子的房屋，是他由兩年多心血的結晶典押過來的，房主是外鄕人，已空了好幾個月，租不出去，但是看守房子的那個老頭，一個月却需要幾塊錢的打發，後來，因爲等着還賬，我們的劉掌櫃以很小的代價押了過來，一押就是十年！値得感謝的還是他這一押，才是我們有了同居的機會，才認識了他的尊容。</p>
<p>掌櫃，那是北方作小本經營的一個統稱，像南方人稱老闆一樣，他就在我們居住的斜對面，開了一個兩間門面的「油鹽店」，這種店，在上海是看不見的，牠的性質在包括了人們所謂「開門七件事」的大部份，高高櫃台，里面放着些油鹽醬醋和各色靑菜之類的東西，因爲在北方，小菜塲是少見的，於是，油鹽店就代替了小菜塲的職務，有很多，也和「米麵店」拼擋的，在購買上自然更給人以便利了。</p>
<p>之後，逐漸的使我們認識了劉掌櫃所抱負的哲學，就因爲同院的關係，就因爲他和孩子們的這點因緣，他的店里，就成了同鄰以及附近購買的對象，這樣，很輕巧的把另外的一家趕跑了。</p>
<p>記得是春天，百物在孕育滋生的時候，麻雀在院落里唱着和悅的歌，跳着由瓦櫺里飛上屋簷，樹梢，怪可愛的，自由在使牠們愉快，於是，牠們在自然間飛翔。孩子們是見不得這些小東西的。想捉，但又那里能够呢？以後，就想了一個妥當的辦法，要從瓦櫺里捉到了牠們的幼雛，養大，來供自己的欣賞，很快的，這辦法被通過了，然而，誰去捉呢？這里，我們的劉掌櫃就一個擔子承接下來。</p>
<p>八仙桌上加大茶几，茶儿上再加小圓凳，他站上去，張着嘴，揀麻雀常常出入的瓦楞伸進了臂膀。突的一條黑的東西躥進他的嘴里，驚慌，跌了下來，嘴緊閉着，手還緊緊地握着黑東西的尾巴，昏過去，血流到他的嘴外，呵呵是一條小黑蛇！</p>
<p>直等到我到天津讀書的時候，他的喉嚨還沒有好。</p>

<p>紅綫盜盒·玉堂春·廻龍閣</p>
<p>在「永遠的微笑」中，胡蝶是演着一個秦淮歌女，是溫柔，美麗，而熱情。</p>
<p>她是一個歌女，所以，中間她是曾經唱出了三個戲曲，開頭在紫金山坡上愉快地遊玩時她是唱出着「红綫盗盒」。以後二齣是「玉堂春」与「廻龙阁」，都是在歌塲裏所唱。</p>
<p>为着這三齣平劇，胡蝶是已經二個多月的鍜鍊的。胡蝶的平劇原來是唱得非常好的，不過是因為已經久沒有鍜鍊了，為着使「永遠的微笑」更其美滿，所以，才用了二個月的時間來鍜鍊此三齣。</p>
<p>處置在「永遠的微笑」中的這三齣戲曲，都是有着它的必要的，在她的歌聲中，劇的情節還是一刻不停地伸展著下去，在她的第一齣歌聲中，是在春的原野裏翻覆了馬車，她第二次的歌聲中是滿寫着徐莘園是在怎樣地為她而顛倒着，她第三次的歌聲中，指出了她是為着一个誰而在歌唱着。</p>

<p>After Director Chiang Dingwen arrived in Nanjing on the 18th at noon, reporters went to visit Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs to inquire about everything. Minister He granted an interview and made a statement, saying that after being appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression of Rebels, he immediately followed the instructions of the central government to direct the National Army to advance rapidly towards Xi'an. Yesterday, Director Chiang Mingsan delivered a handwritten letter from President Chiang Kai-shek of Shaanxi, dated the 17th, to Nanjing. The original text reads: "Brother Jingzhi, I heard that the air force bombed Weinan yesterday. I should be able to return to Nanjing before Saturday of this week, so there must be no conflict before Saturday and Sunday, and bombing must be stopped immediately. Zhongzheng's hand, December 17th." I have already telegraphed the front lines, ordering a temporary cessation of bombing before 6 PM on the 19th. If the rebel Zhang tries to use this to delay the troops and does not send Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing within this period, then I will strictly implement the original plan and thoroughly eliminate them. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Dingwen, Commander of the Second Army, arrived in Luoyang on the afternoon of the 17th, stayed overnight, and arrived in Nanjing by Ford aircraft from Luoyang on the morning of the 18th. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, and Standing Committee Member Soong Tzu-wen, Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission Feng Yuxiang, Central Committee Members Li Liejun and Zhou Fo Hai, Commander of the Gendarmerie Gu Zhenglun, Chen Jicheng's mother, Zhu Shaoliang's wife, Qian Dajun's wife, Legislator Lou Tongsun, Chiang Dingwen's wife, Director of the Office Jiang Renxian, and Zhang Fakui, and more than forty others arrived at the airport at 10:30 AM to await. The Ford aircraft arrived at Ming Palace Station at 11:50 AM. Chiang was dressed in a light blue silk cotton robe, Western-style woolen trousers, and black cloth-bottomed shoes, looking energetic. The welcoming personnel stepped forward to shake hands with Chiang. Soong, Feng, and others immediately asked if Chairman Chiang was well in Shaanxi. Chiang answered that he was well. Then Chen Jicheng's mother, Zhu Shaoliang's wife, and Qian Dajun's wife stepped forward to inquire. Chiang answered everyone's inquiries about safety. Later, he saw Madame Chiang Kai-shek in the car, and then rode in the same car with Soong Mei-ling and Soong Tzu-wen to the Kong Residence in Gaoloumen, and then visited Commander-in-Chief He and other central figures. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Dingwen brought a handwritten letter from Minister of Interior Chiang Tso-pin to Director Tao Luqian, conveying to colleagues in the ministry that he was safe in Xi'an, asking colleagues to be relieved and focus on their work. After receiving the letter, Tao immediately informed all colleagues to take note. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is said that Chiang Dingwen brought back many handwritten letters from various generals and committee members reporting their safety, which have been distributed separately. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Telegraph Bureau, wireless telegraph communication between Nanjing and Xi'an resumed on the morning of the 18th, and telegrams are very crowded. However, trains still only reach Tongguan. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Director Chiang Dingwen arrived in Nanjing by plane from Luoyang at 12:00 noon on the 18th. The reporter rushed to visit his residence and was told about the news from Xi'an. At the beginning of this incident, the Chairman and other military and political leaders who were detained were completely isolated. Zhang Xueliang often came to visit our residences and said that he was reprimanded every time he saw the Chairman. On the first day, he asked the Chairman to accept his proposal and was severely criticized by the Chairman, saying, "Since you call me Chairman, then you are my subordinate. You only have two choices for me today. If you recognize me as your superior, then you should immediately send me back to Luoyang first. Otherwise, you are a rebel. Since I am in your hands as a rebel, you should kill me immediately. There is nothing else to talk about." After that, every time he went to see the Chairman, he would be reprimanded. In recent days, government troops advanced and bombed, so Zhang asked me to see the Chairman. I saw the Chairman at 9:00 AM on the 17th. Zhang Xueliang went with me and forbade me to talk to the Chairman alone. I saw that the Chairman's attitude was calm as usual, so I asked for paper and pen and wrote two letters for me to bring back, one to Minister He and one to Madame Chiang. He said to me, "You can go back and tell everyone that Zhang Xueliang and others must now understand my views on national affairs. The rest are detailed in the letter to Minister He. According to recent observations, I should be able to return to Nanjing in a few days," and so on. After seeing the Chairman, I took off from Xi'an by military plane at 12:00 noon on the 17th, stayed in Luoyang last night, and arrived in Nanjing this noon. When the reporter inquired about the general situation in Xi'an city, Chiang replied that we were completely isolated from the outside world while being detained, so we could not know the truth in detail.

<p>(Nanjing) After Zhang and Yang's rebellion, Sun Ke telegraphed on the 13th, requesting to enter Shaanxi, which was delivered by wireless on the 17th. After receiving the telegram, Sun immediately sent a telegram urging them to come to their senses, stating briefly that the Xi'an Incident was enough to lead to national destruction and racial extinction, not only heartbreaking to the whole country but also intolerable to world opinion. What more can be said about saving the country? If you still have a shred of patriotism or remorse, you should accept the advice of friends from various places and the demands of the people of the whole country, and respectfully send Jie Gong back to Nanjing immediately, and then you can talk about other things. Otherwise, there is absolutely no room for negotiation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Zuoxiang and the Northeastern elders residing here are extremely angry with Zhang's actions, and have forbidden friends and relatives to associate with the Zhang family. A certain Northeastern figure in the opposition even sent a private letter to Xi'an on the 18th, entrusting someone to deliver it, advising Zhang to wake up and repent as soon as possible, and leave a way out for his relatives, clan, and himself. Otherwise, he will be ruined and disgraced, and even if he dies ten thousand times, he will not be able to atone for his sins, and it will be difficult to see his ancestors in the afterlife.

Yu said that after the Northwest Incident occurred, the central government issued an order to suppress the internal rebellion and rectify discipline, but at a time when foreign insults were pressing, and we were shaking the foundations of the country ourselves, it was truly heartbreaking. I was ordered by the central government to go to the Northwest to comfort the military and civilians, and I deeply hope that everyone will consider the difficulties of the time, know that President Chiang Kai-shek is responsible for the country and the nation, repent and change your minds, and send the Chairman back to Nanjing as soon as possible.

<p>(Nanjing) Generals from the border areas of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guizhou sent telegrams requesting to fight against the rebel Zhang Xueliang. The original placement (titles omitted): Zhang Xueliang betrayed the central government, coerced the commander-in-chief, wantonly spread heretical ideas, endangered the country, and acted perversely, which aroused public indignation. At a time when the national crisis is urgent and the situation is dangerous, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, with his spirit of perseverance, leads the masses and devotes himself to national affairs. Clearing the bandit scourge internally and resisting strong neighbors externally, the revival of the nation has laid the foundation. However, this sudden change shocked the whole country. We, Yuanquan and others, belong to the military and are determined to serve the country. We should ask the central government to find ways to rescue the Chairman from danger as soon as possible, and send a large army to suppress the rebellion in order to maintain discipline. Moreover, in these difficult times, we should encourage the spirit of wielding weapons. We solemnly lead all officers and soldiers, swear with the utmost sincerity, under the leadership of the central government, obey orders, be loyal to our duties, to complete the central government's established national policy. The border areas are waiting for orders, how dare we lag behind? We present our innermost thoughts and hope that you will examine them.

<p>(Tokyo) Newspapers, magazines, and organizations studying Chinese issues in Tokyo have convened round-table discussions separately in the past three days to discuss the trends of Chinese politics, which is enough to show the extent of their attention. A section of the Japanese intellectual community believes that the organization of China's political institutions can be said to have laid a solid foundation for the country, and the public's awareness of building a modern state is extremely deep, which cannot be shaken by occasional incidents. They also believe that China's purely national economic and financial organization has been completed, and no local authority can violate the central government's control and act freely. Their conclusion is that although the current incident has somewhat hindered China's unification and caused temporary political and financial instability, it can be restored immediately once the turmoil is quelled. Therefore, they propose that Japan should seize the current good opportunity to express clear goodwill to China to improve Sino-Japanese relations and seek fundamental adjustments to the future relationship between the two countries. The above analysis and opinions are quite noteworthy and influential. Another section believes that China has undoubtedly returned to the chaotic era of the past, so Japan must make a decision at this time, otherwise it will not be able to maintain its position of stability in East Asia. The observation of this faction does not understand the newly developed consciousness of the Chinese people, and its influence seems insufficient to influence actual politics. The general Japanese public believes that the Shaanxi Incident is an unprecedented unfortunate event for China and an important opportunity for Japan to re-examine its China policy. Whether Sino-Japanese relations improve or deteriorate depends largely on Japan's attitude. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Ministry of Propaganda Issues Letter to Compatriots Throughout the Country: There Are Five Reasons Why the Rebel Zhang Must Be Punished <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Department issued a letter to comrades and compatriots throughout the country on the 17th, explaining why the rebel Zhang Xueliang must be punished. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, the whole country has been shocked. People throughout the country, both in and out of government, are filled with righteous indignation. In recent days, public opinion has been excited, and the three armies have requested to fight. The reason why the central government has not added to the attack is that it originally hoped that he would have a final awakening. However, the rebel Zhang has occupied Xi'an and has remained for a week. Although he has repeatedly received telegrams of advice and warning from people throughout the country, the rebel Zhang has turned a blind eye. It is because his wickedness is not concealed, and it can no longer be moved by righteousness. The central government, mindful of the importance of the nation's lifeline and the people's lives, had to comply with public opinion and order an attack, in order to quickly quell the rebellion, consolidate the foundations of the country, and complete the great cause of national revival. Now, we respectfully present several reasons, to inform our compatriots:</p>
<p>For five years, foreign insults have been pressing and national territory has been lost. Anyone with blood and qi must be heartbroken. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presides over the central government, worries about the country and seeks its welfare. The people of the whole country sincerely support him. His safety and security are of utmost importance to the future of our country and nation. Since the Suining War occurred, Chairman Chiang has responded internally and externally and has been extremely diligent. The rebel Zhang Xueliang has long been favored. He should be grateful, loving, and loyal, and fulfill the duties of a soldier. However, at this critical time of survival, he dared to kidnap the commander-in-chief. At the same time, generals such as Chen Cheng and Wan Yaohuang, who are responsible for resisting the enemy at the front, were also detained. Such obstruction of resistance against the enemy and disruption of the rear is tantamount to enmity with 400 million people. Yet, he dared to embellish his words and send telegrams, making presumptuous claims and falsely claiming to resist the enemy, but in reality, it is rebellion. This is the first reason why we must punish him to protect the leader and defend the country.</p>
<p>The country has discipline, and the army has rules. The rebel Zhang is a member of the military, but he committed treason and rebellion, betraying the party and the country, disregarding national law and military discipline. It is truly heartbreaking. At this time when the country is facing difficulties, the life of our nation is entrusted to the government. Anyone with a national consciousness absolutely supports it. The government will never allow rebels to openly advocate rebellion and pursue their selfish desires. If we do not punish Zhang's rebellion, how can we declare it to the world and show a warning? This is the second reason why we must punish him to rectify discipline and strictly enforce national law.</p>
<p>The Red Bandits are bandits who kill, set fires, and loot, causing harm to more than ten provinces for many years. Everywhere they go, corpses are scattered and villages are in ruins. Now they are fleeing in the Northwest and are already at the end of their rope. Eradication is not far off. However, the rebel Zhang was ordered to advance and suppress them, but he did not establish an inch of merit. Instead, he mutually supported them, giving them the opportunity to revive and become a major hidden danger. His actions are already the same as the Red Bandits, and his intentions are no different from those of a traitor. If we continue to tolerate him, the bandit scourge will spread, and the country will be in danger of collapse. This is the third reason why we must punish him to eliminate the remaining Red Bandits and relieve the people's suffering.</p>
<p>Today, politics is on the right track, and the country is moving towards unification. These are all the results of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's arduous struggle for more than ten years, and the result of the strong cohesion of the hearts of the people throughout the country. Precisely because it is not easy to obtain, the people of the whole country must cherish this unification and protect this unification. Anyone who destroys it will swear to rush forward with blades and boiling water. Now, the rebel Zhang's rebellion intends to plunge the country back into turmoil, destroying the entire effort of peaceful unification and national revival. How can those with a bit of blood and qi tolerate it? This is the fourth reason why we must punish him to ensure unification and revive the nation.</p>
<p>There are certain steps to saving the country, and they cannot be achieved by division, disorder, speculation, and luck. It must be under the overall national policy and central leadership, concentrating the strength of the whole country, and with a spirit of self-reliance, engaging in arduous and sustained struggle to achieve success. Anyone who has inherited the historical lessons of the Chinese nation and understands the recent international situation should understand this. The central government is deeply aware of the urgency of the national crisis and has been working diligently day and night, leading the country forward on this path. However, the rebel Zhang wants to fulfill his personal ambitions and dares to use fallacious statements to shake the foundations of the country. In fact, this kind of狂悖行径has no political claim to make. Moreover, today, the central government's policy of saving the country and striving for survival is a set of iron rules that the people of the whole country unanimously believe in. The party government should have the greatest determination and strength to maintain it. This is the fifth reason why we must defend the established national policy and implement the cause of saving the country.</p>
<p>In summary, the right and wrong, the obedient and disobedient, are clearly visible. Now, the central government and the people of the whole country are using the greatest power to eliminate this fierce and stubborn element. The rebellion is quelled, the national revival is not far off. Furthermore, there is something to tell our comrades and compatriots: throughout history, the great cause of revolution has often encountered dangers and difficulties, and finally succeeded. We firmly believe that the Xi'an Incident will never shake our belief in the revival of the nation, and the great cause created by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will be even more inspired by this. Our comrades, dedicating themselves to the revolution, must be willing to sacrifice their heads and blood at any time to uphold the leader and implement the doctrine. Our compatriots throughout the country should also understand the current position of China and the great relationship between Chairman Chiang and the country and the nation, sincerely support the central government, and strengthen their determination to resist insults and eliminate traitors. As for the frontline soldiers who are resisting the enemy, suppressing bandits, bravely fighting and killing the enemy in the icy and snowy weather, we hope that the people of the country will continue to work hard and be their support, and not be discouraged by the Shaanxi Incident. At this time of national restoration, it is our duty to save the country and strive for survival. Wearing armor and helmets, we have no regrets. May our compatriots rise up and work together to plan it. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Liu Zhi and Others Telegraph Zhang's Subordinates: Carefully Discern Right from Wrong, Judiciously Consider Your Actions, Uphold Righteousness and Reject Treachery and Embrace Obedience <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) Liu Zhi, the Pacification Commissioner of Henan and Anhui, along with more than ten senior generals from Henan and Anhui, telegraphed Zhang Xueliang's subordinates Yu Xuezhong, Wang Yizhe, and Dong Xianzhang on the 16th, denouncing Zhang's rebellious actions against his superiors. They hoped that Yu and others would carefully distinguish between right and wrong, judiciously consider their actions, and uphold righteousness, reject treachery, and embrace obedience. The original telegram is as follows (titles omitted): "In recent years, the country has faced numerous misfortunes, with powerful neighbors externally and Red bandits internally. There are sighs of rampant banditry and concerns for the nation's future. Fortunately, our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has led the struggle, standing before the people along with other progressive individuals to turn the tide. Now, at a time when pacification is urgently needed, Hanqing is swayed by a single thought, recklessly endangering the foundation of the nation by kidnapping the commander-in-chief. The news has shocked people near and far. Hanqing was originally from a privileged background. Solely because of his respected father, Mr. Yuting, he seized opportunities. However, he did not strive for self-improvement and indulged in wine, women, and revelry, wallowing in dancing, tobacco, and drugs all day long. In past events, such as the September 18th Incident, the people traced the source of the disaster and were largely unsympathetic. Zhi and others either studied together with Hanqing in their early years or served as comrades-in-arms for a long time, and our personal relationship is very close. We can only sigh and regret this. When we heard that he had returned from abroad and quit his addictions, we were delighted, thinking that he would wash away his old habits, strive for self-renewal, and follow the Chairman to save the nation from peril. But we never expected that he would engage in such a treacherous plot. It is often said that when a gentleman deals with matters, he should first discern right from wrong before considering success or failure. Personal relationships are important, but the will of the people cannot be violated. Now, in Hanqing's action, do you brothers truly think it is right or wrong? Yesterday, Hanqing sent a self-exculpatory telegram. Zhi responded by saying, 'When robbers are at the door, the sons and brothers of the family should unite to resist the invaders, not kidnap the elder entrusted with the care of the entire family. Who but those with ulterior motives would resort to such a scheme?' Though the words are simple, the reasoning is profound. The ancients said, 'The wise adapt to changing circumstances, while the foolish indulge in pleasure when disaster strikes.' Brothers, you now hold military power and are pillars of the nation. For years, you have been ordered to suppress bandits, leading your troops on long expeditions, covering thousands of miles. All Chinese people admire you. We firmly believe that you will not be misled. You will not only use righteousness to overcome any sense of obligation but also never become accomplices to evildoers, cutting yourselves off from the people. However, we still have something to say. You brothers have shared hardships with Hanqing for a long time. Rather than witnessing him sink into injustice, worsening the situation until it becomes uncontrollable, it would be better to decisively, tearfully advise him to awaken early. Loving people with virtue will achieve more. Since the 17th year of the Republic [1928], we comrades have had different opinions. But failing to follow the correct path, acting rashly and recklessly, and initiating war have always ended in swift defeat, fading away like streams returning to the sea. Why is this? It is not because our troops are weak or our strategies are poor, but because the people do not approve, and public opinion cannot be swayed by deception. As for the Guangzhou incident this summer, The Times of London issued a commentary, stating that the sound political views held by the people of our country at all levels were demonstrated by this incident, expressing deep admiration. This was because the generals of the Chen [Jitang] faction, both on land and in the air, were able to clearly recognize right and wrong, upholding righteousness, unlike the warlords of the past who only knew personal gain, ignorant of the nation, willingly acting as henchmen, and the commanders and followers who used the army meant to defend the country and its people as tools to harm them. Moreover, Hanqing's current actions are far more egregious than any previous incidents. All of this is due to Hanqing's reckless behavior, and we cannot help but hope for your intervention. As for Hanqing's character and conduct, Zhi and others have had long-standing ties and would never bear false witness against him. There is no need to elaborate. Take the cases of Yang Yuting and Chang Yin-huai. Both were trusted and relied upon by Hanqing. Yet, they suddenly turned against him, weapons drawn at a banquet. Before the laughter subsided, gunshots rang out. You all know this well. Although there were reasons, it was a perilous situation. As for the Chairman's treatment of Hanqing, he has always been sincere and generous. Even if there were no virtue, there would certainly be no resentment. How could he openly betray his superior while treating his subordinates generously, protecting him all along? Fortune and misfortune have no door; they are brought on by oneself. Though separated by mountains and clouds, we dare to express our sincere thoughts. We hope you brothers will carefully discern right and wrong, and judiciously consider your actions. The future of the nation relies on it. Liu Zhi, Shang Zhen, Pang Bingxun, Sun Lianzhong, Zhang Fang, Xu Tingyao, Liu Maoen, Luo Zhuoying, Fan Songfu, Huang Jie, Li Moan, Gui Yongqing, (Seal)."

Although the Chairman was under duress, comrades within the Party wholeheartedly supported the Central Government and were united in their efforts to rescue him, believing that he would safely return to the capital to lead the revolution. It is hoped that she would not worry excessively and take care of herself for the sake of the nation. (Central News Agency telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) All Party members in Nanjing believe that Zhang Xueliang's rebellion against his superiors, at a time when the nation is facing a serious crisis, is tantamount to helping a tiger commit atrocities and speaking up for a bandit. The impact on the nation and the people is extremely significant. Filled with pain and indignation, all Party members in the city have signed their names, initiating the formation of a National Salvation Rescue Group, willing to make any sacrifice to ensure Chairman Chiang's safe release and return to Nanjing to continue leading the nation.

<h3 id="e21">Fu Zuoyi Discusses: Frontline Soldiers Understand the Situation and Remain Undaunted, Daring Not to Neglect Their Duty to Defend the Territory and Resist Invasion, Grieved and Indignant at the Shaanxi Incident, Eagerly Hoping for Active Awakening <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Guihua) This reporter paid a visit to Fu Zuoyi on the morning of the 18th and inquired about the latest developments in the Shaanxi Incident. He replied that although the situation in Xi'an was unclear, he knew that the Chairman was definitely safe. He continued, "Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang in recent years, the country has made significant progress in all areas. This year, unification was completed, and the national outlook was excellent. Opportunities were changing, and our international standing was also improving. We were hoping to continue our efforts and complete the great task of national rejuvenation when the Xi'an Incident suddenly occurred, causing nationwide anxiety, sorrow, and indignation beyond description. The frontline soldiers are undoubtedly filled with pain and indignation because Chairman Chiang's well-being is tied to the safety of the nation. This incident is not just a personal matter for Chairman Chiang; it is a key point for the survival of the nation. How the nation's future will unfold is a cause for endless hidden worries. However, the frontline soldiers, although constantly in sorrow and eagerly awaiting the early awakening of those who took the initiative, turning danger into safety, dare not neglect their sacred duty to defend the territory and resist invasion. They all understand that only by sacrificing on the front lines can they express the Chairman's will. Remaining undaunted in understanding the situation is the only way to live up to the Chairman's training. Therefore, the morale of the troops has not only not been weakened but has been strengthened with profound sorrow and determination. The former Qian generals are making their best efforts to follow the recent clear orders from the Central Government, implementing the Chairman's past instructions with a spirit of perseverance and sacrifice, expressing the Chairman's will to save the country through hardship, and deploying the strategies of resistance he has taught, so that those who are mistaken can awaken."

<p>— Xi</p>
<p>In recent days, Mongolian puppet bandit leaders have seized the opportunity presented by the Xi'an Incident to actively reorganize their remnants and attempt another large-scale attack. Starting on the 14th, bandit planes on the front lines of eastern Suiyuan have been constantly flying to bomb the National Army's positions and rear areas. At the same time, the bandit army at Nanhuaqian, along with a large number of tanks, launched a fierce attack on Xinghe. Although they were repelled, judging from the military situation, a large-scale war is likely to break out within days.</p>
<p>Suiyuan's strategic location controls the Northwest, making it a key area in military strategy. From the perspective of the entire nation's economy, the survival of Suiyuan is also greatly related to the nation's future. At this time of military tension, the entire nation must have a clear understanding of this point. Please allow me to briefly outline it.</p>
<p>First, the land in the area along the Yellow River within Suiyuan, south of the Yin Mountains, is extremely fertile. "The Yellow River has hundreds of harms, but only enriches the Hetao region" is a well-known saying. Because of this geographical advantage, Suiyuan Province has very abundant agricultural production. Every year, the amount of grain that gathers in Jining, an important town in eastern Suiyuan, and is sold to various places totals no less than one million shi. Moreover, the Hetao area is a famous reclamation area. There is still a large amount of wasteland. According to the provincial authorities' estimates, there are at least 1.5 million Qing or more of wasteland that can be cultivated but has not been. In addition to cultivated land, there are also vast pastures. The pastures of the Ulanqab League and the Yikezhao League produce an astonishing amount of livestock every year. According to statistics from Saibeiguan, from 1929 to February 1933, the export value of hides and skins exceeded 30 million yuan. The production of sheep and camel wool is also around 25 million jin. From this, it can be seen that the agricultural resources of Suiyuan Province are indeed not to be ignored.</p>
<p>Second, most of China's iron ore is located in the Northeast and within Suiyuan. The Northeast has now fallen into the hands of the Japanese, while Suiyuan's iron ore reserves are abundant and await exploitation. Mineral deposits in Taolin, Baotou, Sarachi, and other counties have long been discovered. In recent years, members of the Northwest Scientific Expedition also discovered a large iron bed with a yield of over 136.9 million tons in the Maoming'an Banner. In addition, there must be many undiscovered iron ore deposits. Suiyuan not only has countless iron ore deposits but also extremely rich coalfields. Undoubtedly, Suiyuan should be the center of China's future steel industry.</p>
<p>During the early stages of the Russian Revolution, due to encirclement by the great powers, especially the threat of German troops, the capital wavered, and the soldiers were tired of war. At that time, Lenin told his followers that in times of extreme crisis, they could retreat to the Ural and Kamchatka regions. The purpose of this statement was, on the one hand, to protect their cadre forces from unnecessary sacrifices, and on the other hand, to retreat to the Ural region, where the most coal and iron are buried, to build heavy industry. In his view, only in this way could they revive their country and economy. If we really want to draw lessons from history, then for the sake of the nation's long-term plan, our Urals are definitely not in Yunnan and Guizhou, but in Suiyuan.</p>
<p>Because Suiyuan has the Ping-Sui Railway running across its middle, most of the local products from Gansu, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, and Shanxi must be transported through here and exported from Tianjin. Moreover, the economies of Shanxi and Suiyuan have historically been inseparable. If there is a mishap in Suiyuan, Shanxi Province will inevitably suffer a fatal blow, even from an economic point of view.</p>
<p>The importance of Suiyuan's position is as described above. All compatriots must continue to work hard and do their best to help the frontline soldiers defending the territory and resisting the invasion, so that this place, which is the lifeline of the nation's economy, can be secured. Otherwise, the nation's future will definitely be very pessimistic.</p>

<p>(London) The new Soviet Commercial Representative to London is not the current Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, but another Soviet official with the same last name. Since the announcement of this person's appointment, rumors have spread that Moscow has transferred the Ambassador to China, which is completely false. It is reported that this new Soviet Commercial Representative to the UK served in the Supreme Committee for Foreign Trade of the People of Moscow from 1930 to 1935 and was appointed last year to oversee the Soviet fur export monopoly.

<p>(London) Sir Samuel Hoare, the First Lord of the Admiralty, announced in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government has resolved to invoke Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty to retain five famous cruisers instead of dismantling them. Among them are the HMS Cardiff, completed in 1917, and the HMS Galatea, completed in 1916 (both with a displacement of over 4,000 tons), which had served along the Chinese coast. It is reported that these five ships will be slightly modified, with a reduction in the number of 6-inch guns and the addition of anti-aircraft guns. Sir Hoare explained yesterday the reasons for retaining these five ships, stating that the British government, in view of the deteriorating international situation, believes that no country is willing to dismantle useful warships at this time. Therefore, the British government has exchanged views on this matter with other signatory countries. The US government has stated that it has no objection to the UK's plan to retain these ships for national security. The Japanese government has not yet provided a final response, but it is believed that it will also agree. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned today that two battleships being built by Britain at Tyneside Port will each be equipped with five 14-inch caliber guns. It is claimed that their effectiveness is even greater than that of 16-inch caliber guns. These two new ships, each 35,000 tons, are named HMS King George V and HMS Prince of Wales. All equipment on board will be vastly different from existing ships in the British Navy. According to the London Naval Treaty, the maximum caliber of battleships' guns should not exceed 14 inches. However, if the Washington Treaty signatory countries have not established new regulations by April 1, 1937, 16-inch caliber guns can also be used. It is claimed that British naval shipyards have repeatedly tested and proven that 14-inch guns are actually more useful than 16-inch guns. The construction method of the new guns is currently highly secret. It is estimated that each gun can fire three 1,800-pound shells every two minutes. The speed of the new ships can be increased by five knots per hour. The surrounding steel plates can withstand the largest bombs dropped from the air. The number of aircraft carried on board is also greater than that of other battleships. When answering questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Samuel Hoare, stated that the naval construction plan for next year will soon begin tendering to avoid delays. However, the budget has not yet been approved by Parliament. According to the treaty, Britain should dismantle five cruisers. However, since the present is not the time to dismantle useful warships, they will still be retained. It is generally believed that Sir Samuel Hoare's words show that Britain intends to strengthen its defense in order to cope with attacks. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Washington and London Naval Treaties will expire at the end of this year. Therefore, the British government is rapidly modifying 40,000 tons of "Hawkins"-class cruisers and overage destroyers that should be scrapped, based on the treaty, and intends to retain five "County"-class cruisers in accordance with the "escalator clause." Although diplomatic negotiations are continuing between Britain, the United States, and Japan, the Imperial Japanese Navy generally holds the following favorable attitude: to strive for a satisfactory resolution of the issue of retaining overage warships that should naturally be scrapped. That is: (1) The Imperial Japanese Navy has no major objections to the UK's proposal. Regarding the retention of 40,000 tons of destroyers, Japan retains 11,000 tons of destroyers and 15,000 tons of submarines, totaling 26,000 tons. Moreover, regarding the retention of submarines, it invokes the escalator clause at the request of the US government. It also has no objections to the proposal to retain five "County"-class cruisers. However, the Imperial Government formally replied to the British government on the 17th night according to this principle and telegraphed Ambassador Saito in the United States. As a result, the warships to be scrapped according to the British, American, and Japanese treaties can now be satisfactorily retained by mutually invoking the escalator clause.

<p>(Berlin) Hjalmar Schacht, Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank, published an article in the American magazine "Foreign Affairs," discussing Germany's colonial demands. The semi-official German News Agency pointed out that this article is the first time Germany has publicly stated the minimum requirements for colonial demands, and can be used as a basis for objective discussion. Schacht's original article proposed two conditions for resolving Germany's colonial problem: (1) Germany should retain some colonies to be managed by Germany, and produce the raw materials it needs within this territory. (2) German currency should have a market for exchange transactions in these colonies. Schacht's article also stated that Japan and Italy now have vast colonies, but Germany has not yet been able to achieve its wishes. If Germany's colonial and raw material problems are not resolved, even if the German people are peace-loving, this problem will eventually become a source of disturbance. (Havas, 17th)</p>

Therefore, the government is requesting that naval expenditures, in addition to regular expenses, should be increased by an additional temporary expense of 22.5 million guilders each year for the next three years. Regarding the army, the government is now planning to extend the term of compulsory military service to one year, and increase the annual number of new recruits to 32,000. Furthermore, in order to defend the security of the Dutch East Indies, the government has already ordered a second batch of bomber aircraft from the United States, totaling 39 aircraft.

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons today that negotiations between Britain and Italy are currently underway, but no statement can be issued on this matter before the Christmas recess. According to official sources, the document between Britain and Italy that "mutually guarantees each country's interests in the Mediterranean" has been drafted and is about to be completed, and no difficulties are expected in the future. The two governments also hope to obtain mutual guarantees before the signing of this agreement that no disputes will arise between the two countries regarding the situation in Spain. It is now reported that, in this regard, the Italian government will do its best to avoid any steps that may hinder understanding with Britain. From this point of view, the establishment of a Gentlemen's Agreement in the Mediterranean between Britain and Italy should not be difficult. In addition, well-informed sources recently stated that the French government has suggested to Britain that it join the agreement that Britain and Italy intend to conclude. French Ambassador Corbin visited the British Foreign Office today, and it is believed that this suggestion is related. The British government does not object to France's participation. However, Italy is deeply concerned that if Italy and France mutually guarantee each country's interests in the Mediterranean, the German government will consider this move sufficient to indicate that the scope of disagreement between Germany and Italy has expanded. Therefore, it is hesitant. British political figures now believe that whether France can participate in the Mediterranean agreement depends on the evolution of Italy's policy towards Germany.

(3) Regarding the relationship between Poland and France, after the mutual visits between the Director-General of Army Education and the Chief of Staff of the French Army, the two sides have reached an agreement on national defense.

<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies discussed the 1937 budget overnight, and it was only submitted for a vote at 6:00 AM this morning. During the discussion, a member of the centrist party, former Finance Minister Reynaud, expressed the opinion that the shortfall in the 1937 budget has reached more than 40 billion francs, which must be covered by borrowing. The burden is so heavy that it has never been seen in any previous budget. Although France's economic situation has improved since the devaluation of the franc, it is still less than expected. Retail prices have also risen slightly. In order for the devaluation policy of the franc to succeed, it is necessary to restore budget balance. Finance Minister Auriol replied that the budget shortfall must be made up urgently, even more urgently than being frugal in the economy. Therefore, the devaluation policy of the franc has not been effective as soon as possible. It is now planned to apply for subscriptions from savers for various short-term and medium-term bonds to make up for the shortfall, and the funds obtained will be used for public works and military equipment. In addition, the government must implement a lenient policy towards holders of movable property securities and cash depositors so that funds do not flow out of the country. Finally, the Chamber of Deputies submitted the budget for a vote. The opposition parties, especially the centrist Democratic Alliance Party, the Left-Wing Democratic Party, the People's Democratic Party, and the right-wing Agrarian Party, all voted in favor, but with reservations. Only the right-wing Republican Federation Party voted against. If this budget can be slightly modified when it is submitted to the Senate for discussion in the future, the party can also vote in favor. (Havas News, 18th)</p>

The Adjustment Committee will then convene a plenary meeting the following day, the 23rd. Furthermore, regarding the Anglo-French proposal for mediating the Spanish Civil War, the reply from the Spanish Republican government has been delivered to Forbes, the British chargé d'affaires in Spain. It may be presented for discussion when the Adjustment Committee meets on the 23rd. As for the Spanish Nationalist government, it has not yet responded to the aforementioned proposal. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War previously drafted a monitoring plan for the ports and borders controlled by both sides of the Spanish Civil War, and sent it to the Spanish Republican government and the Nationalist authorities respectively. According to official sources, the Spanish Republican government has expressed its acceptance of the monitoring plan in principle, but declared that it reserves the right to reject the entire plan after thorough consideration. British officials also stated that the official reply from the Spanish government has not yet been delivered to the British government as of now, but the contents of the reply have already been published in Spanish newspapers. Forbes, the British chargé d'affaires in Spain, learned of the reply from the newspapers. This procedure is beyond normal diplomatic practice, and political figures find it quite unusual. The Nationalist authorities have not yet responded to the monitoring plan. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Soviet Union's delay in signing the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Ambassador Shigemitsu in Russia to urge the Soviet Union to sign the treaty. Shigemitsu, upon receiving the order, is scheduled to visit Litvinov on the 19th and issue a serious warning, stating that the uneasy atmosphere between Japan and the Soviet Union is a misunderstanding by the Soviet Union, which should immediately reflect upon it and promptly implement the signing, as this is the most appropriate measure to adjust the relations between the two countries. Shigemitsu also intends to clarify the Japanese government's policy. If the Soviet Union, misled by rumors, continues to delay the signing, then Japan will, in accordance with the Treaty of Portsmouth, protect its fishery rights. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, considering that the Soviet Union's attitude towards this warning has a significant impact on the future relations between the two countries and other aspects, will decide on its final policy towards Russia after receiving Ambassador Shigemitsu's report.

<p>Havana: Rumors are circulating here today that Cuban President Gómez may either voluntarily resign or be forced to step down due to his opposition to the proposed nine percent sugar tax. Army Chief of Staff Colonel Batista supports the tax because the revenue will be used to implement the army's rural education program. The President, however, opposes it because he fears that this education will militarize children. Batista recently declared to the press that if Cuba needs a dictatorship, he will not hesitate to take the lead. The President is deeply dissatisfied with the army's interference in politics. (National dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Havana: Army Chief of Staff Colonel Batista recently submitted a bill to the House of Representatives proposing a sugar tax. President Gómez and the civilian members of the cabinet oppose it, causing the situation to become extremely tense. However, no disturbances have occurred. Political observers fear that a coup d'état will occur imminently, and President Gómez may even resign. Regarding this, Major Marino, a confidant of Colonel Batista, told the press that the rumors of a rebellion are false, and that Colonel Batista has no intention of using force to resolve the sugar tax issue. The rumors that the military and civilian factions of the government have already split are also not accurate. The House of Representatives is scheduled to discuss the bill tomorrow, and it will undoubtedly pass despite the President's opposition. The ABC Party has sent a letter to the President, offering its support to uphold the democratic system and strike down the sugar tax bill. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Washington) In view of the large influx of foreign capital into the United States, causing the securities and exchange markets to fluctuate unpredictably, President Roosevelt summoned Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Eccles today to discuss measures to prevent the activities of foreign speculators. Foreigners have a large amount of capital deposited in American banks, which is being used for speculative purposes, causing market turmoil and economic instability. The US government must frequently use the Exchange Stabilization Fund to curb it. Semi-official figures therefore advocate that the United States, Britain, and France should use the monetary agreement signed on September 26 of this year as a blueprint to establish a new agreement in order to prevent the unwarranted movement of gold and control various speculative activities.

<h3 id="e76">During the Xi'an Incident, the Traitorous Bandits in Chahar Province Eagerly Sought to Stir Up Trouble: A Certain Chief of a Special Service Organ Convened a Meeting of Puppet Leaders, Deciding to Seize the Opportunity to Counterattack Liangmiao and Re-Offend Wuchuan and Guyang <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Zhangbei correspondence: Since the outbreak of the border defense war in Suiyuan on November 12 of this year, the National Army has achieved successive victories. In less than a month, it was able to recover Liangmiao (Bailingmiao and D庙). As soon as the fighting began, it terrified the traitorous bandits. Some were temporarily forced to agree, and many defected to our side. Under the leadership of the leader of the unified national country, the people of the whole country hoped that the National Army would launch a large-scale campaign to eliminate the bandits' lair and recover the lost territories. Unexpectedly, the Xi'an Incident occurred, which was not only a major blow to the country's progress, but also an excellent opportunity for the traitorous bandits to harm the country. This shocking news, upon reaching northern Chahar on the 12th, caused millions of people awaiting rescue to be filled with dismay and anxiety. During this serious period of the incident, there was indeed news that the traitorous bandits were taking the opportunity to stir up trouble. According to a certain gentleman who came to Zhangbei from Jiabusi Temple on the 15th, Prince De had left Bailingmiao for Xisunit Banner on November 22nd, and was recuperating at the palace. The news of the Xi'an rebellion was learned by a certain chief of a special service organ stationed in Jiabusi Temple on the 12th. He immediately telegraphed Prince De and the Mongol puppet military leaders Bao Yueqing, Zhuo Shihai, Li Shouxin, etc., ordering them to depart immediately and gather at Jiabusi Temple on the 13th for an important consultation. Prince De had originally planned to return to Jiabusi Temple on the 14th, but after receiving the telegram from the chief of the special service organ, he advanced his departure from the Xisunit Banner Palace to the 13th and rushed to Jiabusi Temple. Li Shouxin, Bao Yueqing, Zhuo Shihai, and others also rushed from their respective defense areas at the same time. That evening, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of the chief of the special service organ, and it did not end until late at night. The personnel participating in this important meeting on the evening of the 13th included, in addition to the chief of the special service organ, a certain councilor of the puppet Mongolian government and various commanders on the one hand. On the other hand, the traitorous bandits included Prince De, Zhuo Shihai, Bao Yueqing, Li Shouxin, and other puppets. The results of the meeting generally decided to take advantage of the unresolved Xi'an Incident to actively reorganize the military and attack westward: (1) Still using Prince De's Mongolian army, Bao Yueqing, Zhuo Shihai, etc., as the main force, supplemented by a small number of troops from the Rehe puppet army, to counterattack D庙 and Bailingmiao, and to peep westward at Guyang and Wuchuan in northern Suiyuan. (2) Li Shouxin's puppet army and Zhang Haipeng's troops from Rehe to capture Taolin in eastern Suiyuan. (3) Zhang Wanqing's bandit army and Gan Jingxiu's troops from Rehe to attack Xinghe, using their regular army as support for all routes, and commanding everything. At the same time, it was also agreed that Prince De and the puppet Mongolian military generals, such as Li and Bao, would jointly request the ×× army to allocate aircraft, tanks, and other weapons. The reason is that when the ×× side saw the bandits and puppets constantly defecting, it transferred all the tanks and aircraft that had been allocated to the bandits and puppets back to Duolun, so they requested that they be returned to increase their strength. The date of the general attack has not yet been decided, but all units are being urged to quickly reorganize their troops and prepare food. Li Shouxin, Bao Yueqing, Zhuo Shihai, and other officers who went to the temple for the meeting are required to leave the temple on the 16th and 17th and return to their original defenses to prepare everything.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Rice Prices in Guangdong Province Rising Daily: Authorities Telegraph Guangxi Province to Lift Rice Ban for Relief; Banking Sector Sends Personnel to Investigate Hunan Rice Production and Sales <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Rice prices in Guangdong Province have been soaring recently, and have not shown any signs of declining. Those concerned about the current situation believe this is a serious social problem. The authorities previously telegraphed the central government to temporarily abolish the foreign rice tax in order to stabilize market prices. Later, the Finance Department also gathered five million yuan from the banking sector to organize a civil food agency to purchase rice from Jiangxi and Hunan Provinces for sale in Guangdong Province, so as to prevent the outflow of interests. Although the above two methods differ in approach, their purpose is the same: to relieve the people's food supply. According to people in the rice industry, the fundamental reason for the recent high rice prices in Guangdong Province is the poor harvest of late rice. At the same time, the governments of various counties are strictly implementing grain storage for famine preparedness, so that local grain is barely enough for self-sufficiency in each county. Areas that used to have surplus rice and rice flowing to the cities are now in a state of restricted sales. Therefore, the current situation, whether in rural areas or cities, is that the demand for grain exceeds the supply. Moreover, the imported rice from neighboring provinces is not as sufficient as before. The Anhui Province Yanhuzhen Jiangmi rice, due to the province's ban on rice exports, has almost completely cut off the route to Guangdong. Although Guangdong merchants have recently purchased Hunan rice in Changsha, transportation is difficult. The direct train on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway from Guangzhou to Wuhan cannot transport Hunan rice southward in large quantities due to a shortage of vehicles. Although Guangdong rice merchants stationed in Changsha have purchased and stored more than 100,000 bags of grain, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway cannot transport them all at once. If they want to change to waterway transportation to Guangdong, the freight is too high, making it uneconomical for trade. Therefore, a large batch of Hunan rice has still not been able to relieve the current market's thirst. As for Guangxi Province, it has always been a rice-rich area. In the past, Wuzhou rice transportation to Guangdong was one of the largest export commodities. In recent years, due to the turbulence in Guangxi Province, food control has been implemented, and grain is still being actively stored, and the rice ban has not been lifted. Therefore, Guangdong Province, which usually relies on Guangxi rice for supply, has been cut off again since autumn and winter. This is another reason for the shortage of grain in Guangdong. Many inland areas of Guangdong Province that are far from the provincial capital still mostly use silver. Recently, the Provincial Bank has sent personnel to purchase silver coins with additional 20% paper money (i.e., purchasing one yuan of silver coins with 1.2 yuan of paper money). Rural people are accustomed to the silver standard. For example, if they could buy 10 catties of local grain with one yuan in the past, they now need 1.2 yuan of paper money to buy 10 catties of grain. Thus, rice has become 20% more expensive invisibly. Considering the above reasons, the phenomenon of high rice prices has emerged recently. After learning about the reasons, the authorities, led by Governor Huang Musong, immediately telegraphed Li Zongren and Huang Xuchu of Guangxi Province, requesting them to lift the Guangxi rice ban to relieve the rice shortage in Guangdong Province. The telegram briefly stated that Guangxi Province has a surplus of grain, while we are constantly suffering from a shortage. At this time of harvest, we propose to adjust the surplus and make up for the deficiency, and order the lifting of the rice ban to continuously transport rice, which will be beneficial to the people's livelihood and economy of both provinces. It is said that Governor Huang Xuchu of Guangxi Province has other related issues to discuss regarding this matter, and plans to come to Guangdong during the day to discuss everything in detail with the authorities. As for the move by the Guangdong Finance Department and the banking sector to raise funds to purchase and transport Hunan rice, they are also actively raising funds. At the same time, in order to understand the production and sales of Hunan rice, the banking sector plans to form an investigation team to Hunan during the day to investigate in order to release loans for purchasing rice and continuously transport it to Guangdong.</p>

After receiving the report, the Railway Administration immediately dispatched a rescue train to try to put the front wheels back on the rails. It then continued its journey at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Fortunately, all the passengers were safe, but they suffered a fright.</p>
<p>The 302nd Shanghai-Pingtou 2nd and 3rd class combined transport express train, which departed from the North Station at 12:00 PM on the evening of the 17th, stopped at Wujin Station at 4:00 AM yesterday (18th) after receiving the derailment report from Lingkou, as traffic was blocked.

They returned to Shanghai at 10:04 PM that night.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Jiangsu Province Handles River Dredging by Conscripting Labor: Total Mobilization Throughout the Province on a Fixed Date <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Engineering Plans of Various Counties Approved, Actively Preparing: Starting Next Month, Building Dams and Pumping Water; Starting Work in February</p>
<p>Zhenjiang correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department is actively promoting water conservancy construction in the province. River dredging in various county villages is uniformly handled by conscripting labor. In urban areas, the method of drawing labor from able-bodied men is adopted. Now that the agricultural off-season has arrived, various counties have successively started work. The implementation of labor conscription for river dredging in this province this year is recorded below.</p>
<p>Various Counties Actively Planning Projects</p>
<p>Labor conscription in this province is mainly for water conservancy, supplemented by highway construction and afforestation. The Construction Department, considering that the period for labor conscription is imminent, previously ordered various counties to prepare. Currently, the projects to be undertaken by various counties, as well as the estimated project situation, the required engineering costs, and the benefited farmland, have all been investigated and completed. The labor conscription engineering plans and budgets of various counties have been approved separately, and the counties have been ordered to follow the approved plans and schedule the construction dates. The districts have been ordered to prepare according to the schedule. Regarding the engineering plans, the Construction Department has ordered the counties that have submitted their plans to the department to quickly prepare plans for review.</p>
<p>Total Mobilization and Work in February Throughout the Province</p>
<p>Chairman Chen of the province attaches great importance to this matter of labor conscription in the province. Therefore, the Construction Department must carefully select projects, prioritizing those that have a vital interest to the local people. Currently, various counties have dispatched technicians to assist in various districts, responsible for allocating work sections (allocating them based on proximity to their residences), urging the conscription of laborers, providing technical guidance, and inspecting and accepting upon completion. Regarding the dredging of main river projects, it has been decided that various counties will begin building dams and pumping water in January of next year. In February, all laborers conscripted in the province will be mobilized to start work, and it is stipulated that all work must be completed by the end of April, and submitted for review and acceptance at any time.</p>
<p>Using Baojia System to Organize Conscripted Labor</p>
<p>As for the methods of labor conscription, they fully utilize the baojia system for conscription. The method should be based on the bao as the unit. For example, when a certain bao is assigned work on a certain day, all households in each jia of the bao must go to work, so that the township, town, and baojia chiefs are jointly responsible for management and supervision. Furthermore, the department believes that the people of various counties may not have a deep understanding of labor conscription, and they should take the opportunity to instill knowledge about labor conscription during civic training and promote its meaning and effectiveness. The counties have been ordered to follow these instructions.</p>

<p>Prison Official Arrested After Leaving Office</p>
<p>Hou Qixiang, the former prison administrator of this county, was dismissed for repeated prison escapes and for finding opium being smoked by prisoners. Before the handover, he allowed 13 prisoners (outside workers) to drink in the downtown area in groups. After the county magistrate learned about it, he considered him to be perfunctory in his duties and suspected of dereliction of duty. After the official handed over his duties yesterday, he was sent to the local court's prosecutor's office for investigation. After being notified, he was escorted in person and scheduled for another interrogation.</p>

<p>Daily Rise in Food Prices</p>
<p>The price of rice sold in Hangzhou has recently risen sharply due to neighboring provinces such as Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi banning the export of rice, leading to a shortage of supply from Hushui. Rice merchants are suffering significant losses and have requested the municipal government to allow price increases. Yesterday, the rice price assessment meeting decided to increase the price of first to fourth grade fine rice and fragrant glutinous late rice by two jiao per dan, and fifth grade fine rice, secondary rice, and high-grade steamed rice by four jiao per dan, effective from the 17th. However, the price of rice is still expected to continue to rise, and the municipal government is working to increase supply.</p>

<p>Collapse of Building Injures Onlookers Watching the Bride</p>
<p>Zhou Asan, a resident of 205 Hutong Lane in this city, had his daughter Xiu Liao married on the 16th. Due to superstitious beliefs, the departure of the bride in the sedan chair was intentionally delayed. The sedan chair from the groom's family had been waiting for a long time, and the wedding matron repeatedly urged the bride to get ready. Many onlookers gathered upstairs, making a lot of noise. Unexpectedly, the floorboards and railings could not bear the weight and suddenly collapsed, causing all the men and women upstairs to fall down. More than ten people were injured, with Zhou Asan suffering the most serious injuries. The bride was also slightly injured. She hurriedly got into the sedan chair, and the event ended in disappointment.</p>

<h3 id="e90">After the Stalled Sino-Japanese Negotiations: Japan's New Understanding of Diplomacy Towards China <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Nagumo</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>At noon on December 10th, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again issued a "Declaration on China Policy." The main contents of this declaration are:</p>
<p>(1) Emphasizing the unshakable "China Policy" of the Empire.</p>
<p>(2) Deciding on the supreme principle of protecting the lives and property of Japanese people in China.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding past negotiations, listing various facts that the Chinese government has already "internally approved," refuting the Chinese side's claim of disagreement between China and Japan.</p>
<p>What we can see are only the texts published in Japanese newspapers, so we can only speculate based on the records of various Japanese newspapers.</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun, the "agreement between China and Japan" mentioned by the Japanese side refers to the consensus on issues such as "tariff reduction," "hiring Japanese advisors," "Sino-Japanese transportation and communication," and "suppression of anti-Japanese activities." (The Chinese side's claims of disagreement are not discussed because the purpose of this article is to focus on the Japanese side.) However, since Japan claims that there is agreement, then the so-called issues on which agreement has already been reached have naturally lost their problematic nature. What should be paid attention to now is how Japan will force China to implement them in the future. The issue of how to force implementation is the serious issue for the future.</p>
<p>The supreme principle of protecting the lives and property of Japanese people in China is the "power politics" of "exercising military force." The Japanese Three Ministers' Conference (Minister of the Army Terauchi, Minister of the Navy Nagano, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Arita) issued the following conclusion: "Regarding the fundamental policy of protecting Japanese interests and Japanese people in China, we can only rely on the military force of the Empire. … The landing of the Imperial Navy Marine Corps in Qingdao this time is one example of precautionary measures. … Future policy towards China will undergo a major transformation, sweeping away the passive attitude of the past and turning to an active policy. …" This conclusion is already very clear and does not require further evaluation by the Chinese people. The dispatch of troops to Qingdao is certainly one example. The statement by the puppet state of Manchukuo on December 6th to support the Inner Mongolian army is also one example. Such examples can be seen at any time in the future.</p>
<p>As for the so-called imperial China policy, that has always been unshakable, and is now merely being emphasized again. What is the China policy? That is the well-known "continental policy."</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>During the three months of Sino-Japanese negotiations, every time a wave of bargaining occurred, the Japanese military immediately expressed a "tough stance" and a "major decision," as if the East Asian powder keg was about to explode. This powder keg is controlled by the Japanese military. Why is it that to this day, they are still only firing cannons outside the powder keg? Is it because the continental policy has been shaken? No! The Japanese ruling class understands very well that bullets and gunpowder cost money, and even becoming a victorious country will inevitably involve some sacrifices. If they can obtain actual benefits simply by intimidating, then it is most convenient to use cannons to intimidate diplomats. Manchuria has been conquered for five years, but they still have to sacrifice a great deal of Japanese wealth and lives for the few remaining volunteer armies. Conquering all of China would involve an even greater sacrifice, so they must be very cautious.</p>
<p>This caution is not about whether the powder keg should explode, but about the timing of the explosion. The decision on the timing of this explosion depends on Japan's current international environment and Japan's domestic situation.</p>
<p>Japan's current international environment, since the publication of the "German-Japanese Agreement," has clearly undergone the following changes:</p>
<p>(1) Japan has openly declared its participation in the international anti-communist front. Undoubtedly, the future confrontation between Japan and Russia will become even more acute. The European anti-communist front is led by Mussolini and Hitler. Today, the anti-communist forces that these German-Italian leaders can lead include Austria, Hungary, and the Spanish rebels. Needless to say, that is the fascist international anti-communist front. At the same time, the anti-fascist international front led by Russia and France includes Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Spanish People's Government. Japan is using Hitler and the forces in his camp to threaten the Soviet Union, so that the Soviet Union cannot but allocate more troops to defend its western border. In this way, it is very beneficial in terms of the plan to wage war against the Soviet Union. However, there is no certainty of defeating the Soviet Union at present. The main purpose is to contain the Soviet Union and at the same time complete the continental policy. In the process of completing the continental policy, they are also strengthening preparations for war against the Soviet Union. This preparation process makes Japan the most important link on the fascist front. But—</p>
<p>(2) Countries such as Britain and the United States are also mocking this link. This mockery naturally stems from the contradictions between imperialist countries. However, Japan's sense of diplomatic isolation has not been reduced by much as a result.</p>
<p>(3) Japan is eager to turn China into one of the links in its chain. However, the Chinese government has stated that "anti-communism is a domestic issue," indicating that it is unwilling to participate. At the same time, the Chinese national independence struggle movement is developing, which is precisely in direct opposition to Japan's continental policy. The realization of Japan's continental policy means that there will be no independence for the Chinese nation. The independence of the Chinese nation means that Japan's continental policy will not exist. This contradiction is much stronger than the contradictions between imperialist countries. Japan wants the Chinese government to participate in anti-communism, but cannot abandon its continental policy. If the Chinese government abandons the struggle for national independence, it will lose its qualification for national independence and freedom. This is enough to make the Japanese authorities rack their brains. Suppose the Chinese nation, in order to strive for its own independence and freedom, actually allies with the Soviet Union. If the power within China and the Soviet Union (even if the Soviet Union can only allocate one-half or one-third of its national power) unite to fight against Japan, how will Japan cope? This is the focus of Japan's painstaking anxiety.</p>
<p>From Hitler's speech, we know that Hitler is thinking of preventing the communist movement within Germany, and at the same time wants to seize the Ukrainian farm in the Soviet Union. What place does Japan want to take from the Soviet Union? Japan has not yet made such a speech. However, the "Manchukuo" of "Japan and Manchuria are inseparable" has been established for four years. The North China problem and so on are still causing trouble. Can China be willing to abandon the struggle for national independence merely to complete Japan's continental policy and merely for anti-communism? Is Hitler willing to fight to the death? These are all things that Japan must consider.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the rebel Zhang Xueliang launched a rebellion in Xi'an, kidnapped the Commander-in-Chief, betrayed the country and the Party, committed treason and rebellion, and his crimes are unforgivable. The National Government, in order to uphold the authority of the state, protect the righteousness of the people, and uphold justice, has issued an order to punish him, and has specially appointed He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Punitive Expeditionary Force, Liu Zhi as the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Group Army of the Punitive Expeditionary Force, and Gu Zhutong as the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route Group Army of the Punitive Expeditionary Force, to launch a major attack. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of this city, telegraphed the central government, the National Government, the Military Commission, various party, government, and military agencies, various organizations, and newspapers yesterday to support the condemnation, and also telegraphed Commander-in-Chief He and others to wish them victory. The telegrams are transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram One</p>
<p>To the Central Party Headquarters of Nanjing, the National Government, the Military Commission, all departments and councils, all provincial and municipal governments, all provincial and municipal party headquarters, all pacification directors, all commanders-in-chief, all commanders, all commanders, all army, division, brigade, and regimental commanders, all organizations, all newspapers: I respectfully read the National Government's decree to punish Zhang Xueliang, rectify discipline, and maintain the foundation of the country. The words are solemn and righteous, and the whole country follows. The rebel, with a guilty body, commits treason and rebellion, and everyone can punish him. Betraying the country and the Party, his crimes are unforgivable. Our National Government is launching a major attack and ordering the troops to set out, upholding the authority of the state and protecting the righteousness of the people. Seeing the banners go to where they are going, the rebellion will be put down. Wu Tiecheng, holding a position of responsibility, will always wholeheartedly support it. I hope that the senior officials of the border regions, the important marshals, and our fathers, elders, sons, and brothers throughout the country will, under the guidance of the central government, condemn it unanimously, so that the foundation of the country can be laid on a rock and the national lifeline can be extended in danger. I am very fortunate. Wu Tiecheng bows.</p>
<p>Telegram Two</p>
<p>To the Commander-in-Chief of the Punitive Expeditionary Force in Nanjing, Brother He Jingzhi, to the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Group Army of the Punitive Expeditionary Force in Luoyang, Brother Liu Jingfu, to the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route Group Army of the Punitive Expeditionary Force in Guiyang, Brother Gu Mo San: I received your telegram. The rebel Zhang commits treason and rebellion, supporting the leader of the dangerous situation, and destroying the unification created with difficulty. Destroying the budding of national revival, acting as a panderer for tigers and wolves, the disaster is not only internal strife, and the crime is not only rebellion. All of us Chinese people are filled with pain and anger. You have been ordered to punish the rebels, launch a major attack, eliminate the wicked and quell the chaos, which can be expected in a short time. Restore our leader's freedom, comfort our people's hopes, and wish you victory. I am sending this telegram in reply. Brother Wu Tiecheng bows. Skillfully printed.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Yu Qiaqing: Yesterday, He Expressed His Views on the Shaanxi Incident, Stating That President Chiang Should Be Freed First and Strive to Suppress Bandits to Atone for His Crimes <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing expressed the following views on the recent Shaanxi Incident yesterday: Qiaqing has served the community for more than fifty years. When the country was undergoing great changes and the national system was changing, there were many extraordinary people who rose to prominence and established meritorious service. Qiaqing has never belonged to any party. In the past twenty years of the history of the Republic of China, every reform has been followed, and those who have high vision, resolute will, perseverance, and have contributed to the country are the four people Qiaqing admires most in his life: (1) President Sun, (2) Governor Chen, (3) Executive Duan, and (4) President Chiang. Among the four, President Chiang has been with him for the longest time, so his contribution is also the greatest. Those who do not know think that Qiaqing is close to Chiang because of his hometown friendship, but this is not the case. In fact, most of Qiaqing's contributions are related to national and people's livelihood policies, and he has never interfered in personal power. The facts are there, and I believe they are well-known to the people of the country. Now that the three gentlemen, Sun, Chen, and Duan, have passed away one after another, President Chiang is the only one who seeks the welfare of the country and glory for the nation. President Chiang has long served as commander-in-chief, enduring hardships and working hard. He is loved by the whole country. In recent years, based on the principles of pacifying the interior and resisting foreign aggression, the suppression of the communists is about to be completed, the political system has completed unification, national defense has achieved victory, and diplomacy has been appropriate. The foundation has been consolidated, and the nation will soon see a revival. At this time of national turning point, when the commander-in-chief is exhausted, how should our people wholeheartedly support him in order to achieve complete success? Unexpectedly, a bolt from the blue descended from the sky, and the Shaanxi Incident occurred. This is what all the people of our country are united in indignation and hatred. I think that our domestic and foreign affairs have been in a difficult situation for a long time. Fortunately, President Chiang's hard work and perseverance, without complaining, have gradually achieved the goals of pacifying the interior and resisting foreign aggression. His achievements have surpassed those of the past and present. This is recognized by both China and foreign countries, and is not a private word of Qiaqing's preference. Now that President Chiang has been kidnapped, all plans for the benefit of the country and the people will fail. I don't know what the intentions of those who presided over the Shaanxi Incident are. They should be abandoned by the people of the country. I hope they will quickly repent, first restore President Chiang's freedom, and then work hard to suppress the bandits in order to atone for their crimes. Otherwise, the future of the country is unthinkable, and the nation will be plunged into an irrecoverable situation. The culprits will be irreconcilable with the people of the country. Unite as one, respond calmly, and hope to return our only leader. I hope my compatriots will encourage each other.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, Shimizu, Visited Yang Hu Yesterday, Conveying His Deepest Condolences to President Chiang and Discussing Central Policies and Local Security <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shimizu, First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, visited Yang Xiaotian, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, at Mr. Yang's residence on Huanlong Road at 4 PM yesterday. It is reported that Mr. Shimizu was ordered by Ambassador Kawagoe to convey his deepest condolences to President Chiang for his temporary stay in Xi'an, and inquired about future central policies, paying particular attention to the security of this city, and expressed that the Japanese financial community unanimously supports the stability of China's finance in Shanghai. Mr. Shimizu has been stationed in China for many years and has a long-standing friendship with Mr. Yang, so their conversation was unusually cordial. During the conversation, Mr. Shimizu expressed his sincere admiration for Mr. Yang's command of all military and police forces in the Songhu area and his heavy responsibility for local security. They talked for more than an hour before he took his leave. In addition to expressing his condolences to Mr. Shimizu for President Chiang and thanking him for supporting finance, Mr. Yang replied to Mr. Shimizu as follows: (1) The Xi'an Incident is indeed a great misfortune for our country, but the consolidation of the central government, the stability of all parts of the country, and the national finance are absolutely not affected by the slightest incident. (2) President Chiang's temporary stay in Xi'an is safe and sound, and it is a definite fact. I believe that no Chinese would dare to harm President Chiang, because President Chiang is warmly supported by the military and civilians of the country, and even the women and children of the country. Anyone who harms President Chiang will never be tolerated by the 400 million Chinese people. (3) Regarding the future central policy, it will completely continue the past government and President Chiang's consistent policy without any change. The central government has clearly announced this. (4) Regarding the current martial law in Songhu, the Songhu Garrison Command is implementing the central government's circular, which is a common feature of all provinces and cities in the country. However, the situation in Songhu is more complicated. This martial law pays special attention to: 1. Strictly preventing communist elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. 2. Preventing the public from taking collective actions due to their support for President Chiang, which would affect local peace. 3. Strictly preventing those who are unwilling to spread rumors and stir up trouble, and prevent incidents that hinder the harmony of friendly countries.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Shanghai's Finance is Very Stable <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, the stock trading of the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange has been stabilized by the maintenance of various banks. Foreign exchange has been maintained by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, and the British HSBC Bank. The three banks continue to buy and sell without restrictions and handle them according to past foreign exchange policies. Therefore, although trading is brisk, the exchange rate is still the same as the standard rate, which is one shilling and two and a half pence for British currency and thirty US dollars for US currency. As for the Chinese banks and money houses, they are well-prepared and can cope with the current situation, so finance is very stable. The money industry's foreign exchange rate has remained between eight and nine points.</p>

<p>National cultural organizations, concerning Zhang's rebellion, yesterday issued a letter to the nation and a telegram warning Zhang. The following is a separate record:</p>
<p>Letter to the Nation</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our territory has shrunk daily, and foreign aggression has become increasingly urgent. To save the nation, the whole country has been of one mind. At this time of arduous border defense and frequent reports of victories, the sudden occurrence of the Xi'an Incident has caused immense shock. President Chiang is loyal to the country, a fact recognized by all, both at home and abroad. In recent years, he has been working day and night, following the path of self-reliance, and shouldering the great task of national rejuvenation. His hardship and dedication are evident to all. Zhang lost the Northeast and was long ago unacceptable to the people. President Chiang hoped for his subsequent good performance and extended comfort and encouragement. Anyone with a conscience should strive to improve himself and atone for his faults. Yet, he willingly embraced what is wrong, repaid kindness with resentment, rebelled against his superiors, and shook the foundation of the nation. He colluded with bandits under the guise of suppressing them and aided the enemy in the name of resisting them, bringing shame to the nation and inviting the disaster of national subjugation. Judging from his past behavior, he has long since isolated himself from the people. His absurd proposals are even more widely condemned at home and abroad. Alas, the loss of the Northeast, the suffering of thirty million compatriots, the destruction of homes, and the kidnapping of the leader have caused four hundred million Chinese to weep with grief. We hope that everyone will rise up together, uphold justice, support the central government, launch a major campaign of punishment, act swiftly, and terrify the rebels. Let us pledge loyalty and courage to safeguard the nation's lifeline, welcome the return of the leader, and strive for national rejuvenation, to comfort our ancestors in heaven and leave a path for our descendants to survive. In these dark and difficult times, with the nation in peril, let us all work together.

<p>Telegram to Zhang the Rebel</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, With admiration. During the arduous border defense and frequent reports of victories, we suddenly heard of the Xi'an Incident, which shocked the nation. President Chiang is loyal to the country and respected both at home and abroad. In recent years, he has been working day and night, following the path of self-reliance, and shouldering the great task of national rejuvenation. You have been favored and taken care of by President Chiang during times of difficulty. Anyone with a conscience should strive to improve himself and repay his kindness. Yet, at a time when foreign troubles are rampant and strong enemies are pressing on our borders, when we should unite in good faith under the unified leadership of the central government, you have defied the world by rebelling against your superiors, shaking the foundation of the nation, bringing shame to the nation, and inviting the disaster of national subjugation. Is this a sign of madness, or have you been surrounded by petty people, acting against your own will? Or are you willingly acting as a tool for the tiger, isolating yourself from the people? A moment's difference in thought is all it takes for you to ruin your own reputation. But shouldn't you think of your descendants? Today, people are deeply concerned about the seriousness of the situation and are rising up to uphold justice. The one who tied the bell should untie it. It is not too late to repent and make amends. If you can obey reason, change your mind, immediately send President Chiang back to Nanjing, and lead your troops to obey orders, so that the nation can turn danger into safety, you may still be forgiven by the people. This urgent telegram expresses our utmost anticipation (signed by the same organizations as the letter to the nation).</p>
<p>Telegrams from Other Organizations</p>
<p>(1) China Engineering Society, China Electrical Engineering Society, China Mechanical Engineering Society, and China Chemical Industry Association yesterday jointly telegraphed to Zhang Xue Liang, "Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, The Xi'an Incident is a laughingstock to friendly nations. At a time when the foundation of national unity is taking shape and the war of resistance in Suiyuan is victorious, if you care about the hope of national rejuvenation and do not want to see internal strife re-enacted, which would benefit the enemy, then you should immediately send President Chiang back to Nanjing to preside over the major affairs of the nation. This is not just for President Chiang, but for the nation. Our societies are heartbroken by the nation's difficulties and express our condolences. We hope you will consider it." China Engineering Society, China Electrical Engineering Society, China Mechanical Engineering Society, China Chemical Industry Association.</p>
<p>(2) All teachers and students of Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries School yesterday sent a telegram to condemn Zhang, "To the Central Executive Committee, the National Government, and all compatriots: The rebellious general in Xi'an has kidnapped the commander-in-chief. At this time of national crisis, his rebellious act is a unprecedented anomaly, which angers both gods and men. The central government has already issued a clear order to suppress the rebellion, and the army is on its way. We hope that all compatriots will express their righteous indignation and launch a major campaign to eliminate the rebellious atmosphere, rescue the commander-in-chief, and quell the chaos and stabilize the country in one fell swoop." All teachers and students of Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries School.</p>
<p>(3) All teachers and students of the Law School of Soochow University yesterday telegraphed Zhang Xue Liang, "Mr. Zhang Hanqing of Xi'an, Since Chairman Chiang was kidnapped, all of us have been furious. Our school, together with the authorities of various universities in Shanghai, telegraphed you to pull back from the precipice and consider the overall situation, and quickly escort Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing to preside over the major affairs of the nation. However, you have remained stubborn and have shown no sincere intention to repent. You will inevitably suffer punishment, and both the good and the bad will be destroyed. Even if you do not care about the condemnation of future generations, once the army arrives, you will certainly not be spared. Please think it over." All teachers and students of the Law School of Soochow University.</p>
<p>(4) Feng Chengzhi telegraphed, "To the Shanghai Shen Bao (newspaper) transferring to the Nanjing National Government and Commander-in-Chief He of the punitive expeditionary army, Zhang Xue Liang, defying the world, kidnapped the commander-in-chief, betrayed the country, and acted like a beast. His actions have aroused public outrage. Our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, with perseverance and frugality, is committed to completing national unification and revitalizing the nation, and his life is tied to the survival of the country. How could this Zhang rebel and act perversely, harming the country and the people? His crime is unforgivable. I implore you to command the national army to annihilate him quickly, and to rescue Chairman Chiang to reassure the people. Suppress the treacherous and rebellious." Feng Chengzhi, captain of the military training team of the high school attached to the National Tongji University.</p>
<p>(5) "To the Nanjing National Government and Commander-in-Chief He of the punitive expeditionary army, At a time of serious national crisis and urgent border defense, when the entire nation should unite to resist foreign aggression, Zhang Xue Liang has defied the world, kidnapped the chairman, and rebelled. His actions are intolerable under national law. We implore Commander-in-Chief He to quickly assemble a large army to sweep away the rebellious atmosphere and welcome Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing to reassure the people and maintain the foundation of the nation. The military training students of our college, armed with spears, are willing to be in the vanguard. We are eagerly awaiting orders." Ma Houwu, military instructor of Shanghai Law College, and all military training students.</p>
<p>(6) All staff and students of Great China University sent a telegram requesting the government to quell the rebellion as soon as possible. The original telegram is as follows: "To the National Government: Unfortunately, the nation is facing a serious foreign invasion. Zhang Xue Liang, who bears a great and irreconcilable hatred, should not only fail to strive to improve himself, seek revenge, and atone for his faults, but instead colludes with reactionaries, betrays the country, kidnaps the commander-in-chief, disrupts the front line of resistance, and obstructs the revival of the nation. Everyone with blood and spirit shares the same deep hatred. Our government is rectifying discipline and has ordered a punitive expedition. We hope that the army will advance westward, sweep away the rebellious atmosphere, and protect Chairman Chiang to complete the great task of national revival. Our school pledges to uphold our government and its established national policies with a rigorous and resolute spirit. This urgent telegram expresses our utmost anxiety. We implore you to consider it." All faculty, staff, and students of Great China University in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Wave of Condemnation of the Rebellion from Various Groups <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Following Zhang Xue Liang's rebellion in Xi'an, various circles in the city sent telegrams one after another urging him to reflect and requesting the central government to suppress the rebellion. The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union yesterday telegraphed Yan Xishan to rescue Chairman Chiang and urged Zhang to come to his senses. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Associations also sent telegrams condemning the rebellion. The following is a compilation of the telegrams:</p>
<p>Request Yan to Rescue</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union yesterday telegraphed Yan Xishan, Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, requesting him to rescue Chairman Chiang, "To Vice Chairman Yan Xishan in Taiyuan, Zhang Xue Liang has rebelled in Shaanxi, kidnapped the chairman, and shocked the nation. Your devotion to the country is respected by the world. We hope you will find a way to rescue him, so that the fate of the nation will not be severed. The 450 million people will offer incense and pray for you. This urgent telegram expresses our utmost anticipation. Peng Bowei, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union, and Committee Members Mao Yufeng, Lu Shuangxi, Cheng Yongming, Chen Yuanlong, and others, representing 150,000 seamen."</p>
<p>Urge Zhang to Come to His Senses</p>
<p>The union also telegraphed Zhang, "To Mr. Zhang Hanqing and Yang Hucheng of Xi'an, Foreign aggression is imminent, and saving the country requires unified action under the leadership of the central government's overall national policy. We fear that our efforts may not be enough. Yet, you have suddenly rebelled, kidnapped the revolutionary leader, and destroyed the nation's lifeline. By defying the world and seeking to unite with the Communists to resist Japan, we fear that the tiger at the front door has not left, but the wolf at the back door has already entered. The hearts of the 450 million compatriots have not died, and they will never allow you to slaughter them. A moment's decision will determine your future. We hope you will consider it." Peng Bowei, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union, and Committee Members Mao Yufeng, Lu Shuangxi, Cheng Yongming, Chen Yuanlong, and others, representing 150,000 seamen.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Association Telegram</p>
<p>"To all compatriots through all national newspapers, Zhang Xue Liang is from a family of bandits, with the nature of jackals and wolves. He does not know how to avenge his father or defend the territory of the country. Recently, he has acted perversely, taking advantage of the fierce Suiyuan war and the government's full efforts to cope with it, to suddenly kidnap the commander-in-chief and send a telegram of rebellion. Our Chairman Chiang is a sage who toils for the country, never resting, and always keeping his word. He is loyal and resolute. After ten years of hard work, the country has finally been unified, and the people can live in peace. We were hoping to unite against the enemy and reclaim our homeland, but unexpectedly, trouble arose within our ranks. As a result, the party and the country have lost their center of gravity, and military and political affairs have come to a standstill. Zhang's crimes are too numerous to count. After he lost the Northeast, he was almost homeless, like a fish escaping the net, a dog without a home. Our Chairman Chiang was generous, giving him a chance to make amends, hoping he would learn from his mistakes. However, he nurtured a tiger that wounded him, which is ungrateful. Zhang is a general with military power, supported by the state and entrusted by the people. Yet, he defied public opinion and rebelled, which is disloyal. An ungrateful and disloyal person should be abandoned by the world. Moreover, a traitor who betrays the party and the country is called a rebellious official, and one who forgets his father and revenge is called a traitorous son. Everyone has the right to punish rebellious officials and traitorous sons. Although the central government has issued a clear order to launch a major campaign, we, the people, should also condemn him in writing and verbally, so that he will not be tolerated in the light of day, and the great cause of resisting foreign aggression and saving the nation can be continued and completed. We hope all compatriots will join in condemning him." Jiangsu Provincial Association in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Association Telegram</p>
<p>"To the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Nanjing, and to all schools, organizations, and newspapers in the country: Seeking national liberation is our only goal, and uniting to resist foreign aggression under the guidance of the revolutionary leader is our only belief. Especially at this time of fierce Suiyuan war, when the bandits are about to be wiped out and the lost territories are gradually being recovered, no one should be allowed to act arbitrarily, disrupt our plans, treat national affairs as a child's play, or cut off the nation's lifeline. Zhang Xue Liang has never made any contribution to the country and has lost four provinces. The government has forgiven his past and encouraged him to improve in the future. He should change his ways and strive to serve the country. However, he has been incompetent in his duties and slow in suppressing the Communists. Now, he listens to heresy and harbors ulterior motives, causing Chairman Chiang, on whom the safety of the people depends, to lose his freedom, affecting the war of national salvation in Suiyuan and Shanxi, and destroying the unified situation that has just been stabilized. He has not only betrayed the leader's support and the nation's expectations but also given the enemy an opportunity. He is an enemy of the 400 million people. Filled with grief and indignation, we can only implore the central government to issue a clear order to quell the rebellion and rescue the leader from danger. We also hope that all compatriots will rise up to condemn him. The country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate." Zhejiang Provincial Association in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Wireless Communications between Shanghai and Shaanxi Disrupted Yesterday <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>According to transportation agencies, wired telegraph service between Shanghai and Xi'an was restored once on the afternoon of December 15 at 8:00 PM, but was disrupted again at 9:30 AM on the morning of December 16. As a result, telegraph services have been temporarily relayed via wireless to Hankou and other locations. However, due to the lack of direct wireless lines between Shanghai and Shaanxi, the transfer of telegraphs from Xi'an via Hankou and other locations was also disrupted from 4:30 PM yesterday. As a result, wireless communications between Shanghai and Xi'an have been completely suspended. A Reuters report from Shanghai on December 18 stated that communications between Shanghai and Central and Northern China have been severely affected by the Xi'an Incident. Since Zhang Xue Liang announced his rebellion, wired and wireless telegraphs to Xi'an, Lanzhou, Hankou, Beiping, and other locations have been extremely congested, with official telegrams accounting for the majority. As a result, news and private telegrams have been much slower than usual, and some locations have been completely disconnected, including Xi'an and Lanzhou. According to a Reuters correspondent in Hankou, no airmail has been received in the past two days. A correspondent in Beiping also stated that airmail from Shanghai takes 48 hours to arrive.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Current Situation Affects People's Food Supply <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Rising Prices and Difficult Living Conditions</p>
<p>The price of food in Shanghai, such as rice and flour, has been rising for the past two months due to strong sales in the north. Recently, the price has been inflated due to speculation taking advantage of the situation. Rice has risen to 11.6 or 11.7 yuan, reaching a peak in price compared to the old measure. Flour has risen to 4.3 yuan, which is over twice as high as the lowest price. The price is likely to continue to rise. Small businesses that sell rice and flour are all affected. Oil has risen to 25.5 yuan per dan. Salt is 360-370 cash per jin. Vegetables are over 3 yuan per dan. The value of foreign currency has decreased, and one French currency yuan can only be exchanged for 280 copper coins, which is 40 copper coins for 10 silver coins. This is a decrease of 200 cash from the previous month, which makes it difficult for ordinary people to live.</p>

Gaoqiao District will start work today. The remaining districts will continue to implement the project as soon as preparations are completed, without holding further ceremonies.</p>
<p>Message to the Citizens</p>
<p>To raise awareness among citizens, the committee specifically issued a message to the citizens, saying: "Dear citizens, modern nations are built on the foundation of group living. Modern society requires everyone to be able to labor, serve society, and seek the welfare of society. If individuals only care about their own food and warmth, are selfish and self-interested, and only think about their own glory and wealth, then society cannot move forward, public morality will decline, and the nation will never be rich and strong. Therefore, Chairman Chiang said, 'If we want to be modern citizens and succeed in modern undertakings, we must labor.' Our labor must be meaningful, which means that in addition to doing our own jobs well, we must also do things that are beneficial to the country and society. We must serve society and the nation, and then a new nation and society can be built. The meaning of labor service lies in everyone serving the local area, everyone having the obligation to serve the local area, and engaging in national economic construction. Implementing labor service is the most urgent way to carry out national economic construction and an important stage in moving towards a new society and a new nation. It has been two years since the New Life Movement was initiated. Within these two years, the New Life Movement has spread throughout the country, and its influence has revitalized social customs. At the same time, labor service has made us realize that it is the best way to build a new society and a new nation. Now, the newly built roads, newly opened rivers, and newly created forests in various places, if added up, are countless. So many new constructions are the result of labor service, and their direct and indirect promotion of social welfare and national economic construction is truly a great force. Shanghai is the center of everything in the country, with a large population and flourishing industries. However, the rural areas near the city still have a lot of work to be done, such as opening up rivers, building roads, and repairing dikes, which require the labor of citizens to build. Therefore, starting from now, we have decided to first mobilize male citizens between the ages of 18 and 40 in ten districts, including Gaoqiao, Gaohang, Luhang, Jiangwan, Zhenru, Yinxiang, Yinhang, Pusong, Wusong, and Caojing, to dredge the canals needed for social development. The methods of labor service have been announced, and the work plan has also been decided. Citizens probably still remember that two years ago, the city suffered a severe drought. Although the drought was due to a lack of rainfall, the main reason was that the rivers in various districts of the city were silted up, making irrigation inconvenient and affecting the harvest of agricultural products. If we could have managed water conservancy well at that time, the drought would not have been so severe. This shows that dredging rivers is a very important matter. Moreover, diligence and labor are a good virtue in life, and they can also promote physical health. We can find many examples of this in history, such as Tao Kan moving bricks. Therefore, we believe that everyone's labor service now is both promoting social construction and welfare, and it is also beneficial to ourselves. Dear citizens, let us unite, take up shovels and hoes, and work together to serve the country, society, and our own welfare, and strive forward!"</p>

<p>National Federation of Commerce Appeals to the Ministry of Finance to Order Compliance</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that it had received a cable from the Anyang County Chamber of Commerce in Anhui, stating: "Since the implementation of legal tender in this county, the most commonly used fractional currency is issued by the Central Bank and the China Farmers Bank. These fractional currencies mostly circulate in lower-class society and change hands several times a day. After being used for a long time, they are severely damaged. However, the Central Bank has a branch in Bengbu, making it easier to exchange damaged notes. However, the Farmers Bank has not established exchange offices in various counties in northern Anhui. The bank's fractional currency is becoming increasingly damaged. Disputes often arise in merchants' transactions. If this continues, the market will come to a standstill, and merchants will be in dire straits. The association has repeatedly requested relief from higher authorities, but nothing has been implemented to date. Your association leads the entire country and is responsible for maintaining the interests of its members when they encounter difficulties. Therefore, we are submitting four damaged fractional notes from the Farmers Bank and requesting your review and referral of a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the bank to quickly establish exchange offices or authorize the Anyang Office of the Anhui Local Bank to exchange them without restriction in order to maintain the currency system and stabilize the market. We await your urgent instructions." Upon receiving this, it is appropriate to cable the Ministry of Finance for verification and request approval to order the China Farmers Bank to comply. Broken notes attached. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Tobacco Leaf Guild: Requests Release of Detained Domestic Tobacco <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Tobacco Mistaken for Flue-Cured Tobacco; Letter to the Tax Bureau Explains</p>
<p>The Zida Tobacco Leaf Company, located at Pu'an Lane, Yong'an Street, French Concession, Shanghai, previously sold 100 packages of domestic Champion tobacco to the Shunkang Tobacco Company in Wenzhou. The Shunkang Company is now reselling it to the Xindongxing Early Tobacco Shop in Wenzhou. While the transaction was in progress, Erxun, an inspector from the Wenzhou Tax Inspection Office, mistakenly identified it as flue-cured tobacco (i.e., domestic American-type tobacco) and intervened, ordering 15 packages of tobacco to be sent back to the Bank of China warehouse and prohibiting any movement. Although Shunkang Company presented all the certificates from the tax authorities, the inspectors still insisted that samples be sent to Shanghai for inspection, refusing to allow free sale. Shunkang Company pointed out that when the batch of Champion domestic tobacco was transported from Shanghai to Wenzhou, it had been inspected by various local tax bureaus and customs offices, confirming that it was domestic tobacco, and they held a domestic tobacco tax certificate as proof. The inspectors neither trusted the certificates issued by the tax bureau nor had the experience to immediately distinguish domestic tobacco from flue-cured tobacco, so they hastily ordered the tobacco to be stored in a warehouse and prohibited its sale. In this situation, the legitimate business of tobacco merchants lacks legal protection. It has been reported to the Zida Tobacco Leaf Company, which has sent a letter to the local Tobacco Leaf Guild, requesting the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau to order its release immediately and to prevent intentional obstruction in the future in order to reassure the tobacco industry. It is also known that the local Tobacco Leaf Guild has already sent a letter requesting its release.</p>

<p>The China Flying Society's flying class, which began training in June of this year, has been following the primary flying curriculum of the Central Aviation School, training daily. All students have decided to fly solo, and have also practiced and become skilled in various aerial maneuvers. Yao Xijiu, the secretary-general of the society, and the instructors believe that the studies have been completed. Graduation exams have been scheduled to begin on the 21st of this month and have been reported to the Aviation Commission, which will send personnel to supervise the exams. On that day, the exams will begin at 9:00 AM at the Longhua Airport, both morning and afternoon. The exams are expected to be completed in two days. The central supervisors, as well as the president Wu Tiecheng and vice president Wang Xiaolai, are expected to personally supervise the exams. A total of 31 students will graduate this time, including one female student, Yang Yingxun. It is also rumored that after the exams, the society plans to have the graduates leave the society first and await the periodic issuance of diplomas. Furthermore, the society, which first established civil aviation education in the country, has only two training aircraft, with a total flight time of more than 800 hours. Training has not been suspended in any weather conditions. Not only have all the students been able to complete their studies, but the aircraft have also never suffered even minor damage. Its achievements are truly commendable.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Yangtze River Six Companies planned to weigh goods shipped to various Yangtze River ports according to the example of measuring dimensions. Starting from the 15th of this month, goods measured by weight would be weighed in full, including the weight of the packaging. However, the shipping companies could add a 5% commission to compensate customs brokers. This matter has provoked opposition from various customs brokers, resulting in the postponement of implementation on the 15th and an announcement of a temporary delay for further discussion of solutions. However, the attitude of the customs brokers is very firm, insisting that there is no room for negotiation unless the proposal is cancelled. Yesterday, the Six Companies convened the customs brokers again to discuss solutions. The customs brokers nominated the chairman of their guild, Chen Panjun, and two others to represent them in a second round of discussions with the Six Companies. However, the customs brokers refused to compromise on their demands and would rather organize a united strike. The two sides were unable to reach an agreement during the on-site discussion, so the matter remains unresolved.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Municipal Council Employees: Oppose Salary Cuts <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Employees Union Lodges Protest; Police Department Personnel Considering</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, the special committee of the Municipal Council Employees Union yesterday (the 17th) formally protested to Feixin Dun, Director-General of the Municipal Council, regarding the salary cuts. It is said that what they oppose is the 8% salary cut is of secondary concern, what they oppose most is the reduction of compensation for losses in pension remittances and the reduction of various subsidies. At the same time, personnel from the Police Department are also considering lodging a protest, but it is unlikely to be implemented immediately. The leaders of each police station met last night at the Police Officers' Club on the top floor of the Fuzhou Road General Police Station to discuss the matter for a long time. They also held a meeting on Thursday night. The Police Superintendent did not attend either meeting. The results of the meeting were not announced. It is said that the police personnel believe that they should receive better treatment than personnel from other departments in order to be fair, because their duties involve dangerous situations. In recent years, theft cases have frequently occurred in the concession. During arrests, bullets fly and lives are at stake. Even if they are not killed, they are often disabled by bullets.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Hou Zongtai Sues Zhu Xianghe: Intentional Defamation <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Hou Zongtai sued Zhu Xianghe of the Zhuyu Industry Guild at No. 25 Houjiahong Road in the District Court for spreading words and intentionally defaming him. The petition stated: "The plaintiff and the defendant are both shareholders and directors of Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Co., Ltd., and the defendant is a director and assistant manager of the company. The factory was established on May 10, 1934, with a capital of 50,000 yuan. The defendant, acting dictatorially, entered into contracts with Tongfeng Company for operating Jingfeng Factory with advances, collecting a security deposit of 20,000 yuan, and presenting a bankruptcy announcement to the First Special District Court, without convening a board meeting in accordance with the company's articles of association. The plaintiff objected to it, but afterwards, the defendant still convened a shareholders' meeting in his own name, intending to force shareholders to ratify his illegal conduct. The plaintiff sacrificed 1,820 yuan in cash and 3,000 yuan in shares for the Jingfeng Company and suffered from unclear entanglements. Therefore, out of a sense of responsibility, he published a notice in the Minbao on November 17, stating the facts to clarify his responsibility. Unexpectedly, on the 15th, the defendant fabricated false statements and suddenly published a news advertisement in the Ten Large Businesses, spreading words that were insulting to the extreme, saying (1) Mr. (referring to the plaintiff) is a director and uses his qualifications as a lawyer to threaten illegally at every turn. He usually turns clouds into rain and creates discord within the company, instigating lawsuits. Mr. volunteered to represent the company in court, thereby seizing several thousand yuan in legal fees from the company. Mr. has been successful in his own plan. (2) Mr. seized 2,000 shares by taking advantage of an opportunity at the beginning of the company's establishment. (3) Xianghe has too little legal knowledge, so Mr. was able to profit from it through clever means. (4) If Mr. publishes a notice in a semi-classical and seemingly understandable but unclear style again, I will not respond, etc. However, the plaintiff has always been very distant from the Jingfeng personnel, so how could he have turned clouds into rain? And in the two civil and criminal cases brought by former manager Huang Shengchang against Chairman Xie Meisan, Xie entrusted the plaintiff with several cases with a public fee of only 750 yuan. How could there be thousands of yuan? At the beginning of the company's establishment, Huang Shengchang voluntarily allocated 2,000 shares out of 20,000 yuan as compensation. How could it be called seizing it by taking advantage of an opportunity? And he has never received a cent from Jingfeng. How could it be called profiting from it? The plaintiff has studied hard for ten years, and the defendant's reference to 'semi-classical and seemingly understandable but unclear' is clearly intentional slander. Please investigate," etc. Yesterday, Judge Shao held a hearing, but the defendant did not appear. Chen Zhongyin, lawyer, requested a postponement. The judge ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for the 23rd.</p>

<h3 id="e129">New Invention by the Chung Hwa Book Company: "Eight-Function Calendar Clock" <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Price: $18.88 Each</p>
<p>The Chung Hwa Educational Equipment Manufacturing Plant, established by the Chung Hwa Book Company, launched its invented and manufactured month, day, week, hour clock last spring. It was granted a special patent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and exempted from transit duties by the Ministry of Finance. All sectors actively purchased it, praising it incessantly. However, the manufactured product was a wall clock, relatively large in size, only suitable for hanging in halls. Now, the plant's engineer, Mr. Ruan Shunfa, to meet general needs, has specially created a table clock that can be placed on a desk. Furthermore, a thermometer and hygrometer are embedded in the clock face. Thus, with one such clock, seven records – day, month, week, hour, day/night, temperature, and humidity – can be automatically displayed on one clock. How simple is that! But with ordinary desk clocks, even a slight misalignment can cause them to stop. This clock has a newly invented, adjustable clock stand installed internally, so it doesn't have this problem. As the year is coming to an end and all sectors are planning to purchase calendars, if they can purchase this clock, then a calendar becomes unnecessary. Using this as a gift, since it's a new invention, the recipient will definitely feel doubly interested. It is reported that the company, for the sake of widespread use, is now generally offering a special price of only $18.88 per clock. Both the Shanghai distribution office and the Beijing-Hangzhou branch have displays and welcome visits.</p>

<p>Tomorrow (Sunday) marks the date of the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra's eleventh weekly concert. The previous concert was scheduled to feature a solo performance on the viola by Professor Fu'a, the orchestra's assistant conductor. Unexpectedly, Professor Fu'a recently fell ill and was unable to participate. Therefore, Chief Conductor Mei Baiqi retained Mr. Dukesdalski, a cello expert traveling in Shanghai, to perform another cello solo. Mr. Dukesdalski has long enjoyed a great reputation in Europe. He recently came to China on a trip and participated in the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra's performance last Sunday, earning extremely high praise. His return to the stage this time will surely be welcomed by music lovers. The location remains the Lyceum Theatre, starting at 5:15 PM.

<p>Shoushi Company, organized by Shanghai's yarn and cotton magnates Yu Jusun and Shen Changgeng, purchased 112,000 bales of cotton from the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange from Kui Yanfang in July of this year, with delivery scheduled for the end of August. Later, Yu Jusun refused to take delivery, claiming that the goods did not match the description. He entrusted lawyer Jiang Yiping to sue Kui Yanfang in the First Special District Court, demanding the return of a deposit of $150,000, warehouse rent and interest of $50,000, and compensation of $300,000, totaling $500,000. Kui Yanfang then commissioned lawyers Liu Chongyou and Zhang Zhengxue to defend him and filed a counterclaim for $150,000. All this was reported in the previous newspaper. The judgment was delivered the day before yesterday. Judge Li Huting, accompanied by prosecutors Luo Can and Mo Runhua, ascended the bench in the Sixth Court and announced the judgment: The plaintiff should compensate the defendant with $150,000 in national currency and interest at an annual rate of 5% from December 3 of this year until the day of execution. The plaintiff's lawsuit was dismissed, and the plaintiff bears the litigation costs. After the session ended, it was heard that Yu Jusun planned to appeal the judgment.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Stranded Ship at Honggaopo Removed: Xunhan Route Reopened; Water Level in the Upper Reaches Plummets; Hankou at 2 Feet 4 Inches <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>—Shipping Companies Deeply Worried About Disruption—</p>
<p>For days, the Yangtze River ships of various Shanghai companies have experienced delays in imports and exports, with some being delayed en route for as long as three or four days. Regular scheduled ships have all been disrupted. The reason is that the river water level has dropped dramatically. Each Yangtze River ship going upstream or downstream, loaded with goods from Hankou, cannot travel directly. Upstream ships arrive in Jiujiang and then use barges to transfer goods. Downstream ships can only wait in Jiujiang for Hankou goods to be transported by barges, then reloaded onto the ships before heading east. Because the water level in the Jiujiang to Hankou section is surprisingly low, and the number of shoals increases daily, the navigable channel has become increasingly narrow. Yangtze River ships traveling to and from the Xunhan section have basically been unable to navigate at night, and even daytime navigation is extremely difficult. Furthermore, one incident has disrupted the traffic of Yangtze River ships: a large civilian ship suddenly ran aground at Honggaopo of Flame Mountain (a dozen or so li below Wuxue), the shallowest and narrowest part of the waterway, starting on the 13th, blocking the river and cutting off the navigable channel. This prevented the Yangtze River ships of six companies from traveling upstream and downstream. Subsequently, the Jianghan Customs specifically dispatched a small tugboat to the location to drag the stranded civilian ship to clear the waterway. However, it could only be moved a few feet, enough for small ships to pass with difficulty, but larger ships could not pass. As a result, the Jiangshun ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was delayed and disrupted. Originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th, it only arrived yesterday afternoon. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin, and Sanpei ships were also blocked, with delays of up to five days. Only yesterday did the Jianghan Customs send a telegram to Shanghai, stating that the civilian ship that had run aground and blocked the river at Honggaopo had been removed after repeated attempts, and the obstructed channel near Flame Mountain, which had been blocked for many days, was now safe for passage. The companies received the telegram and distributed it to the captains of the Yangtze River ships for their information. However, in recent days, the water level in the Jiujiang-Hankou section has fallen further. The water gauge in Hankou is only 0.73 meters, equivalent to 2 feet 4 inches, which is the new record for the lowest Yangtze River water level this year. Upon receiving the report, the six companies have been loading even less cargo onto the upstream Yangtze River ships departing from Shanghai since yesterday. Even goods bound for Zhenjiang and Wuhu cannot be loaded, leaving a limited tonnage specifically for direct transport to Xunhan. A lot of goods are piling up in Shanghai, and Yangtze River passengers are extremely anxious. The 20% increase in shallow water fees does not cover the cost of transshipment, resulting in even greater losses for the companies. Currently, the Yangtze River ships of the six companies cannot operate on schedule, as there are constant incidents of blockage and grounding. If the water level continues to drop, Yangtze River ships will truly be unable to pass through the upper reaches of the river.</p>

<p>Regarding the lawsuit between Tonghe Foreign Firm and Qingliang Temple over relocation, the temple believes that the original confirmed judgment was ambiguous and the execution exceeded the scope. They have filed appeals and objections to the execution. The appeal part has already been ruled by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to overturn the original execution order and halt the execution. The details were seen in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Guo heard the lawsuit regarding objections to the execution. The Qingliang Temple was still represented by lawyers Lu Qi and Yuan Xilian, while Tonghe Foreign Firm and Sheng Yuzhou were represented by lawyers Xu Shihao and Ding Rong. Both sides argued endlessly over the ownership of the executed houses. After mutual debates, the plaintiff's agent, lawyer Lu Qi, immediately requested the court to conduct an on-site inspection for differentiation. Judge Guo approved the request and will personally conduct an inspection on the morning of the 19th and scheduled a continued hearing for the 21st.</p>

<p>Xing Zhigang, the district chief of the Fifth District in Chenjiahang Town, Pudong, Shi Gongwei, secretary of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, Gao Shuan, deputy director of the wharf management office, and Wang Jun, an inspector, were recently sued by Yu Wenlin (aka Yu Asi), a native of Funing, for obstruction of freedom and defamation. Lawyers Zhou Yingjie and Zhou Yingcai filed a private prosecution in the Criminal Court of the District Court. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, Judge Yu Lüde</p>
<p>Opened the Hearing</p>
<p>The plaintiff, Yu Wenlin, was absent, and the lawyers appeared in court to state the case, roughly saying that around 9:00 AM on September 9 of this year, the plaintiff was unjustifiably detained by the fourth defendant, Wang Jun, at the Gongyi Wharf and taken to the wharf management office, then transferred to the Public Utilities Bureau and sent to the Caohuo Jing Vagrant Work Center for detention. According to family inquiries, this was instigated by Xing Zhigang for illegal detention. They requested investigation, etc. Xing Zhigang testified, age 47, Shanghai native, and also testified that according to reports from boatmen, there are often</p>
<p>A Group of Ruffians</p>
<p>Using my name to collect illegal fees on the wharf. Therefore, I reported to the water police and the wharf management office to detain them and did not specifically order the detention of Yu Wenlin, etc. Shi Gongwei was absent and was represented by Feng Chengqiu from the Public Utilities Bureau. The judge informed him that in criminal proceedings, the defendant must be present in court, and he had no right to speak. He was told to return to the bureau and instruct the defendant to be present in court next time. The judge then questioned Gao Shuan, age 40, from Zhejiang Province, currently serving as</p>
<p>Warehouse Wharf</p>
<p>Deputy director of the management office. On the morning of September 9, Wang Inspector arrested a ruffian extortionist, Yu Wenlin, and transferred him to the Public Utilities Bureau for review, etc. Wang Jun testified, age 34, from Zhenjiang, a patrolman at the wharf management office. Around 9:00 AM on September 9 of this year, I inspected the Gongyi Wharf and saw a group of people arguing on the wharf. When they saw me arrive, they scattered. But there was one person</p>
<p>Escaping by Boat</p>
<p>I immediately sounded the alarm and detained him at the wharf. Upon questioning, Yu Wenlin claimed to be a wharf watchman, insuring boatmen's cargo was loaded and unloaded, and should receive wages. He copied out a booklet recording the illegal fees collected, totaling 111.50 yuan. The wharf management office does not have a watchman position, so he extorted fees under a false pretense. I detained him at the management office for disposal, etc. At this point in the questioning, the plaintiff's lawyer, Zhou Yingjie, stated that the plaintiff was a watchman hired by boatmen and has various</p>
<p>Boatmen's Stamps</p>
<p>As evidence. The plaintiff watches the boatmen's cargo day and night, exchanging labor for pay, and is hired by merchants, which is not illegal. The position of watchman, whether on land or water, has not been employed by the government and is freely hired by merchants. This situation is clearly for other purposes, unjustly detaining people, depriving them of freedom, and damaging their reputation. We request strict investigation to protect civil rights and request that the work center be instructed to provide vocational relief to the plaintiff, etc. The judge agreed to reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Tuberculosis Exhibition Success <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tuberculosis Exhibition, which opened on the 15th at the Wuzhou Pharmacy, has been visited by thousands of people daily. The exhibition displays various models and specimens of tuberculosis, tuberculosis statistics, tuberculosis prevention photos, health books, etc., to promote public awareness and is indeed essential. The association recently noted that people from all walks of life are not fully aware of X-ray examinations. Therefore, it especially informs the public: (1) Anyone suspected of having lung disease, regardless of whether they have any pain or symptoms. (2) Anyone suffering from respiratory diseases for more than three weeks and not recovering. (3) Anyone who has frequently experienced respiratory diseases in recent years should undergo an X-ray examination. Summing up the above, a definite rule is that it is a mistake to determine that one's lungs are healthy without an X-ray examination. In other words, a doctor cannot determine that a patient has no lung disease without an X-ray examination. Therefore, for accurate diagnosis of lung health, an X-ray examination is essential, especially X-ray photography. It is known that the China Tuberculosis Association holds X-ray examinations every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings at the First Clinic at 306 Fangxie Road, Ximen, and every Wednesday morning at the Hongqiao Sanatorium Branch at 2 Daxi Road. Anyone suspected of having tuberculosis should be examined as soon as possible to implement early diagnosis, which will be of great benefit to tuberculosis prevention work.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Bus Driver Kills Two People in Accidents: Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months Imprisonment; Appeals the Original Judgment <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Changyou, a Dingbei native, age 33, a driver of British-owned China General Omnibus Company bus number 472, killed someone in a car accident in the Public Concession last year. He was sentenced to imprisonment by the First Special Court and given a suspended sentence. Before the suspension period was over, at noon on October 28 of this year, Zheng was driving public bus number 15089 and driving on Haige Road. When approaching the intersection of Zhaofeng Road and Maiqi Road, a Zhou Amao, an apprentice at the American fruit store in Jingansi Road, was riding a bicycle in front. The Zheng driver was careless, only honked the horn, and did not brake, but drove straight forward. Zhou heard the horn and misunderstood, dodging to the side of the road, and was hit by Zheng's bus, dragged for about three yards. Zhou's arms and ribs were broken and he died before medical treatment could be given. The French police detained Zheng and brought him to the Second Special Court for prosecution. Judge Sun Penghuai concluded the trial and recognized that Zheng was sentenced by the First Special Court, and the suspension period had not expired. He committed a negligent manslaughter again, and his circumstances were particularly heinous, so he should be punished severely. Zheng was sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment. Zheng Changyou appealed the judgment to the Third Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, Wu Tingqi, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, together with judges Wang and Liao, and prosecutor Dong, attended the Criminal Court Three for questioning. Lawyer Fei Xizhen from the French Police Department appeared in court. The court first questioned the appellant's reasons for disagreeing with the original judgment and the details of the accident. Then, according to a report from the traffic office's western police officer on the investigation after the accident, the court also summoned witness Gu Jingduan, a Chinese police officer number 300 from the Jingansi Police Station, who witnessed the accident. The court ordered a rescheduling of the hearing, and the appellant was still returned to the detention center to await review.</p>

<p>Zhou Yonghua, a Ningbo native working as a Hongbang tailor, attempted to smuggle ten gold bars and eighteen ten-yuan gold coins and one five-yuan gold coin from Japan, totaling 15,000 yuan, on the Changxing Company's Asia Empress. The Japanese Consulate in Shanghai discovered this and, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the HSBC police station, went to the Gonghexiang Wharf around 1:00 AM on the 14th of this month to arrest Zhou Yonghua, along with the gold bars and gold coins, and brought him to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the hearing in the Criminal Court Five. Zhou Yonghua, represented by lawyer Wu Kai, stated that the case was being rescheduled and, as a result of the police investigation, the police believed that the evidence was insufficient. Therefore, they requested the cancellation of the detention and immediate release. It was requested that the confiscated evidence be temporarily detained pending further investigation. Next, the Japanese representative of the Japanese Consulate stated that two accomplices had been arrested in Kobe, Japan, and requested that the confiscated evidence be transferred to the Japanese Consulate. When questioned, Zhou Yonghua testified that the gold bars were entrusted to him by an old Wang on the ship to be delivered. Finally, Wu Kai, Zhou's lawyer, rose and argued. Judge Zhan ordered Zhou Yonghua to be released immediately and released him in court. The seized gold bars, etc., were temporarily detained pending the location of the owner for return.</p>

<p>Court Reschedules Hearing</p>
<p>Wu Ruisheng, a Shanghai native, age 22, residing at 680 Haige Road, possesses substantial wealth and owns two cars, including number 3100. He usually lives lavishly. His wife, Shi Meiying, has been married for two years. Recently, Shi suspected that her husband was having an affair, so she investigated very closely. On the afternoon of the 26th of last month, at 7:00 PM, she saw her husband walking with another woman at the Great Shanghai Cinema on Yu Qiaqing Road. After returning home, she quarreled with him. Unexpectedly, Wu beat Shi and injured her. She reported to the Jingansi Police Station and filed a lawsuit against Wu for assault. The First Special Court once summoned him and ordered an out-of-court settlement. Yesterday morning, Judge Pan continued the hearing in the Criminal Court Two. Shi Meiying's lawyer, Shen Xingxia, submitted a statement to the court, saying that the defendant's residence was located on an out-of-bounds road, so he requested that the case be transferred to the District Court. Wu Ruisheng argued that the area was in the Concession. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, requested that the police be ordered to investigate the location to clarify the truth. The defendant's lawyer, Wu Linkun, said that the settlement conditions proposed by the plaintiff were divorce and payment of alimony of 80,000 yuan, so it was impossible to reach a settlement. The court then ruled that the case would be rescheduled for a week.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Stolen Gold Pen Nib Case: Investigation of Receiving Stolen Goods at Silver Shop <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Zuling, age 25, a Ningbo native and manager of the Huahua Fountain Pen Factory at 34 Bowuyuan Road, recently stole 576 dozen gold pen nibs manufactured by the factory and sold them to the Laotianbao Silver Shop at 318 Nanshou, Shaniu Company, French Concession, for a price of 2,228 yuan and spent the money. The Huahua Factory owner, Xu Zhifen, discovered this and reported it to the police and requested the arrest of the receiver of the stolen goods. The owner of Laotianbao Silver Shop saw the newspaper and noticed that the stolen pen nibs were marked with the words "Huahua." Therefore, he melted the gold and resold it to Juxing Silver Shop at 264-366 French Avenue. Subsequently, the Public Concession Police arrested Jiang Zuling and notified the French Police to send detectives to the Laotianbao and Juxing Silver Shops to search for the stolen goods. The shop owners had all fled, and only the shop assistants, Wang Changchun and Yuan Jixian, who handled the receipt of the goods, were detained and released on 200 yuan bail each by the Second Special Court pending investigation. Jiang Zuling's theft case was investigated and sentenced to six months imprisonment by the First Special Court. Because the stolen goods were under the jurisdiction of the Second Special Court, the French Police sent detectives to the First Special Court to transfer Jiang Zuling back to custody the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to Criminal Court Eight of the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Minsheng questioned him. The Police Department's lawyer prosecuted according to law. Because the defendants, Wang Changchun and Yuan Jixian, who were released on bail, did not appear in court, it was impossible to conduct the trial. The court briefly questioned Jiang and ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the 22nd. Jiang was returned to custody.</p>

<p>After the discovery of the headless trunk corpse in the Sentuan Society, the Hongkou Police arrested the firefighter, Mao Agen, Jiang Yuantan, and the female tea server, Lin Gendi, and sent them to the First Special District Court. After repeated trials, they were found not guilty due to insufficient evidence. The police appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, and the appeal proceedings were underway. The Chinese and Western detectives handling the case found that Ye Kuiyu, a Ningbo native and the gatekeeper of 3 Cunfu Lane, Baibao Road, was suspected of destroying evidence. They immediately arrested Ye and transferred him to the First Special Court for detention and investigation. Yesterday morning was the day the detention period expired, so Judge Xiao Yulin questioned him in Criminal Court Three. Ye Kuiyu hired lawyers Qian Xingzhong and Li Zemin to defend him. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated that after a thorough investigation of the respondent, Ye Kuiyu, it was found that the evidence was insufficient to establish a crime, so he requested a cessation of detention. After Judge Xiao Yu reviewed the report, he ordered Ye Kuiyu to be released. It is heard that the police's appeal in the case has been accepted by the Second Branch of the High Court and is scheduled to be heard at 1:00 PM on the 19th of next month. Fan Gang, Mao Agen's lawyer, received the court's notification yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Divorce Case Hearing: Cross Signature Examination Results Show Not Written by the Same Person; Remarriage Case Heard Again Yesterday <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>In the case of Zhuang Tinggui from Wuxi and his newly married wife Za Lili being sued for bigamy by Zhuang's divorced wife, Zhu Yundi, the First Special Court's Judge Qian Hongye held another hearing in the first criminal division yesterday morning. Zhuang's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, stated that he was instructed by the court to reconcile with Ms. Song. The defendant was willing to add a considerable sum to the alimony already given (over three thousand yuan). However, Zhu insisted on returning to the Zhuang family, resulting in the failure of reconciliation, etc. The court then immediately declared that the cross signature written by Zhu and the signature on the divorce document signed by Zhu had been sent to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for examination, and it was determined that they were not written by the same person. Subsequently, the court ordered the start of the debate. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, argued that in addition to the crime of bigamy, Zhuang had also committed the crime of forging documents and requested a judgment according to the law, etc. Lawyer Chen Tingrui argued that regarding the point of whether or not there was a divorce, this case already had testimonial and material evidence, etc., sufficient to prove that there was indeed a divorce. As for the signing of the cross, the person must be illiterate, so the signature today would be like this, and tomorrow another format, which is a common occurrence. Therefore, civil law stipulates that the signing of a cross must have two or more witnesses. Moreover, the circumstances under which Zhu signed the divorce document and when she came to court to write several clumsy crosses were completely different. The discrepancy in the signatures was a natural occurrence, and she should be declared innocent, etc. Judge Qian then instructed Zhu's lawyer, Wang Shizong, that this case should first file a civil suit to confirm that the divorce document was invalid and then adjourned the case for another hearing.</p>

<p>Chen Cai, a woman from Wuxi, is thirty-eight years old and resides in her hometown. In November of the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), because she had many children, she voluntarily gave her two-year-old daughter, Jin Di, to Guo A'liu (also known as Guo Mao), a woman from the same hometown who resided at 94 Xiangfen Lane, as an adopted daughter. Raised until now, Jin Di is now sixteen years old. In order to secure her future livelihood, Guo A'liu ordered Jin Di to learn dancing, so that she could rely on it for a living. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month at around 8 PM, Jin Di suddenly pretended to go out shopping and never returned. Guo A'liu immediately published an advertisement the next day to search for her. On the 5th, Guo A'liu suddenly received a letter from lawyer Xu Jinyu, which stated, "According to Shen Yiqing, my sister, Jin Di, has recently been forced by Guo A'liu to engage in prostitution, soliciting customers everywhere. Forcing a good woman into prostitution is prohibited by law, but Guo A'liu is blinded by profit and has committed a crime. I have no choice but to take my sister back and give you three days to come and discuss a solution, otherwise I will pursue legal action," etc. After receiving the letter, Guo A'liu realized that her adopted daughter, Jin Di, had been seduced by Shen. She then sent a letter to her biological mother, Chen Cai, asking her to come to Shanghai and engage lawyer Zhu Honglie to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Shen Yiqing for disrupting the family, violating Articles 227 and 241 of the Criminal Law, and attaching a civil suit for compensation for mental distress of five hundred yuan. Yesterday afternoon, this case was heard by Judge Huang Risheng in the Eighth Criminal Division. Shen Yiqing did not appear, nor did a representative lawyer appear in court. After Judge Huang briefly questioned the plaintiff and others, he ordered the hearing to be postponed.</p>

Recently, he was mistreated by his aunt and uncle and found it unbearable, so he secretly fled to Shanghai. However, he was unfamiliar with the place and had no one to take him in. Yesterday afternoon, he was crying at Lao Beimenxi on Minguo Road. Hu Yifeng, a fellow townsman living in Aijia Lane, saw him and asked why he was crying. The boy recounted the details of the mistreatment and his escape and recognized Hu as a compassionate person, willing to recognize Hu as his stepfather and asking to be adopted. Hu, however, was concerned that the boy's background was unclear, so he reported it to the police and took him to the police station, which transferred him to the bureau for relief.</p>

Lu instigated Fengzhen to divorce her husband in order to live together as husband and wife. It went to court, and as a result, she compensated her husband seven hundred yuan for the divorce. Later, she repeatedly urged Lu to formally marry her, but he remained evasive. Recently, the two had conflicting opinions. Fengzhen demanded the return of the compensation money paid to her ex-husband, but Lu refused. Therefore, a few days ago in the afternoon, she dragged him to the Yi Miao Police Station, accusing Lu of being ungrateful and seductive and asking for the money to be recovered. After interrogation, it was found that the case was related to a marital dispute, which was a civil matter and should be sued in court.</p>

<p>Zhang Jin (also known as Qin), an obstetrician from Changzhou, resides at 24 Weiwei Lane, Weihaiwei Road. The other day, because her relative, surnamed Zhou, was holding a celebration at the Yan Maoyuan Restaurant at 267 Hubei Road, she went to congratulate him. At the time, she placed her velvet vest in the cloakroom. That morning, two pieces of clothing were stolen from the cloakroom, so Zhang paid close attention. Unexpectedly, at 7 PM, while seating arrangements were underway, Ji Wentian, a fifteen-year-old child from Tongzhou who distributed flyers for the Tiansheng Guiding Agency at 305 Gongqing Building, 454 Hankou Road, came in, and under the pretext of distributing flyers, sneaked into the cloakroom and stole Zhang's velvet vest, attempting to escape. Zhang saw him and stopped him. Because he was young, she released him after a slight reprimand. Unexpectedly, the child returned to the agency and complained to the agency owner, Ms. Li Li (twenty-five years old, also known as Li Lili), a woman from Ningbo. She immediately led female guides Wu Jie and Zhang Wenying, and Ji Wentian, to Yan Maoyuan to reason with Zhang, making a loud commotion and intending to invite Zhang to a Yile Tian Teahouse to settle the matter (commonly known as "eating jiang cha"). Zhang firmly refused, leading to a continuous dispute. The Yan Maoyuan staff reported to Hua Constable Bao Tan and Cao Qishan of No. 3188, who arrested Ji Wentian and Li Li and took them to the Lao Zha Police Station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the situation and prosecuted them for theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Law and for restricting freedom under Article 305 of the same law, requesting punishment according to the law. After Zhang Jin testified, Ji Wentian and Li Li denied the facts of theft and restricting freedom.

<p>Yue Lai, the abbot of Lingshan Temple on Fushentang Street in the Nanshi, trusted Pu Huai, the temple's receptionist, because of his loyalty and competence.

When their extortion failed, they secretly placed morphine and other drugs in Pu Huai's room and anonymously reported it to the police, who arrested him and sent him to the Shanghai Garrison Command. Fortunately, the investigation revealed that he had been framed, and he was released on bail. Recently, Abbot Yue Lai received three anonymous letters on the 16th, 20th, and 28th of last month, attacking Pu Huai and demanding his expulsion. Fearing further accidents, he presented a petition to the patrol lane police station requesting an investigation.</p>

<p>Ten-Foot Pearl Curtain</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are abundant in late autumn and gradually become scarce in winter, so winter chrysanthemums are especially precious. Chrysanthemum lovers often regret their scarcity. The various chrysanthemum varieties produced by the Huang Family's Animal and Plant Breeding Farm in Zhenru have always been well-known. After many years of research and cultivation using scientific methods, they have obtained hundreds of pots of famous chrysanthemum varieties this year. As winter approaches, the owner of the Huang family, in order to share with everyone and avoid regrets, has specially entrusted the Wang Kai Photo Studio on Nanjing Road in this city to sell them at a very low price. Each pot is sold for only one yuan in national currency. With such a low price, such a valuable famous flower is an opportunity that chrysanthemum lovers should not miss. The picture above is named "Ten-Foot Pearl Curtain", a famous variety of the Huang family, published to give a glimpse.</p>

A colorful arch was erected at the school gate, and the Party and national flags were hung. Teachers of the school stood respectfully at the entrance to welcome guests.

<p>Fudan University has implemented measures to save coal and contribute to Suiyuan starting this week. All offices in the school will not be heated this quarter. Heating will only be provided if the weather is cold enough for the Fahrenheit thermometer to drop below 40 degrees, causing water to freeze and hindering writing. The library and reading room will also only be heated if the temperature drops below 40 degrees. The hygiene team's examination room and other special circumstances may be determined according to the climate. All faculty, staff, and student dormitories will also not be heated. If faculty members want to install their own stoves, they must pay 20 yuan per person per month for coal, with the surplus used as a donation to aid Suiyuan.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Market Moving Towards Normalcy, Cotton Yarn, Cotton, Grains, Flour and Wheat All Falling, Government Bonds See Rise, Exchange Rates Strengthen <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market gradually returned to normalcy, sweeping away the anxiety and apprehension of the past few days. Consequently, bullish cotton yarn traders were already selling off their positions. Although prompt delivery prices remained firm, forward delivery prices fell by more than five yuan. Cotton also shifted from buying to selling. In the minds of speculators, there was no longer any concern about currency prices. Even yesterday's foreign exchange market, although English and American tobacco companies were settling transactions in shillings, Chinese merchants were actively reselling their previously acquired holdings, causing exchange rates to strengthen. This is a reflection of financial stability. Bullion buying was also subdued. The government bond market, which often takes politics as its backdrop, saw a rise in all unified bonds yesterday. Ding bonds saw the largest increase, rising by one yuan and nine jiao. December C bonds also rose by one yuan and seven jiao and five fen. Other bonds rose by one yuan and three or four jiao. Flour prices, which had been rising wildly for days, continued to rise in the morning for each month's contract, ranging from two fen to two fen and seventy-five per cent. However, in the afternoon, as the situation unfolded, flour prices in the later market fell more than they rose, down by four or five fen compared to the morning. Wheat prices fell by one jiao in the afternoon. The impact of Jiang Dingwen's return to Beijing on the Shanghai market was like the weather yesterday: overcast and gloomy in the morning, threatening snow, but by noon, the sun was shining brightly.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Yarn Flowers: Actual Sales Ultimately Lackluster; Cotton Yarn Marked by Heavy Selling; Distant Futures Plummet by a Steep Five Yuan; Current Month's Decline Still Slight <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak, and the decline is gathering momentum. This is because the continuous rise in prices in recent days has prompted profit-takers to sell, easing the pressure on the market. At the same time, yarn sales have become sluggish. From the afternoon until closing, rumors circulated in the market, and as the news improved, the selling intensified, causing each month's contract to plunge by more than two yuan. In reality, the rise in recent days has been too drastic, and this kind of temporary reaction is to be expected.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Bears Already Unloading Goods</p>
<p>In the morning session for spot yarn, as the delivery date for the current month approached, bears with 2,000 bales of Five Blessings Shepherd yarn from twenty entities and 100 bales of Red Dipper Star yarn from ten entities began unloading into warehouses. This eased the pressure somewhat. In addition, as news about the current situation improved, government bonds rose, and margin calls fell, there were fewer buyers in the market, and the market gradually declined. The results for spot yarn showed that each month's contract fell by 2.1 to 3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, but the current month only fell by 8 jiao. In the afternoon session, the bullish force for the current month remained strong, and the market outlook was still upward. However, distant futures were more stable, with little fluctuation in the second and third positions. By the time of closing, reports indicated that spot yarn transactions were not smooth. With improving news circulating in the market, sellers rushed in like a tide, causing prices to fall by more than 2 yuan, with distant months breaking through the 40 yuan mark. The results showed that each month's contract fell again by 2.7 to 1.9 yuan compared to the morning session's closing price, while the current month fell by 2 jiao. Sales included 2,700 dan from Hengyi, 850 bales from Dafu, 1,850 bales from Yuda, 2,000 bales from Mingde, 1,050 bales from Hexing, 700 bales from Dachangcheng, 900 bales from Yongda, 1,300 bales from Zhenda, 1,050 bales from Taixing, 1,200 bales from Shenji, 1,350 bales from Run Kang, and 1,000 bales from Xiecheng. Purchases included 1,200 bales from Juxing, 1,200 bales from Renfeng, 1,000 bales from Yichang, 3,300 bales from Changfeng, 3,450 bales from Dachang, 1,550 bales from Hexing, 850 bales from Senkang, and 550 bales from Taichang. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left:</p>

<p>The cotton market is weak, and the decline is intensifying. This is due to simultaneous declines in the American and Indian cotton markets. After the high price increases, some spot cotton can now be unloaded. At the same time, the yarn market is declining, and people are apprehensive, causing selling to increase further. The decline intensified from the afternoon until closing.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Falls by Seven to Eight Jiao</p>
<p>In the morning session for spot cotton, as American and Indian cotton both declined and Osaka Sanpin-ka also fell by six to seven jiao, and as news about the current situation improved, there were more speculators in the market, leading to a looser market. The results showed that each month's contract fell by 4 to 4.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session opened with the market still firm, and each month rose slightly by 1 jiao. However, after the yarn market weakened, it suddenly fell at closing. The results showed that each month's contract fell again by 2 to 3.5 jiao compared to the morning session's closing price. Sales included 5,800 dan from Fengtai, 3,100 dan from Gengfeng, 1,700 dan from Zhenda, 2,200 dan from Yuda, 4,500 dan from Renfeng, 5,400 dan from Run Kang, 4,100 dan from Fukang, 3,500 dan from Chengcheng, 5,000 dan from Yongyu, 2,200 dan from Yicheng, 5,000 dan from Taixing, and 1,500 dan from Xiecheng.

<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with each month down 2 to 6 points. Early in the morning, many small speculators liquidated their long positions, taking the pain, and the market price was weak. According to reports, news from Washington indicated that the loan cotton program has made progress and may be implemented soon after the New Year. Officials are eager to sell at current market prices but are trying to avoid disrupting the market. The March and May contracts, priced within 12 cents, saw activity from traders and investors buying in, showing a slight rebound. Afterwards, the market situation was mixed, with near-term contracts weaker. The closing was stable, with spot prices down 17 points and futures down 4 to 17 points. English cotton spot prices fell 3 points, and futures fell 4 to 6 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to short covering, then rose due to day yarn rising and exporters buying in, but finally retreated due to long liquidation. Bengal fell half a rupee, Oomra fell 1.25 to 1.5 rupees, and White Broach fell 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is listed on the left (dated 17th):</p>

<p>The trend in the cloth market is increasingly weak. As the situation in Shaanxi gradually eases, people's mood is relaxing. The yarn market is plummeting, and spot sales of cotton cloth from all sources are extremely sluggish. The decline is becoming more and more pronounced, and cloth prices are also declining rapidly. Yesterday, white fine cloth fell by 1 to 1.5 jiao per piece, and fine twill fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao per piece. Sales of coarse cloth and coarse twill remain stable, but heavy coarse cloth has slightly fallen by 5 fen. Sales of colored cloth are also extremely stagnant, with selling prices down 1.2 jiao. Printed goods and woolen fabrics, etc., which did not rise much before, are also relatively stable. Cloth prices had risen too sharply and had already reached their peak. Many traders have accumulated low-priced goods and are eager to sell them off to make a profit. Therefore, cloth prices may continue to decline. However, spring white satin, printed tribute silk, serge, and other goods are currently at their lowest prices due to seasonal factors. Wholesale dealers from Hunan, Sichuan, and this street have been actively searching for them in recent days, and more than a thousand boxes have been traded.</p>

<p>In yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, the market for each month's contract showed an initial rise followed by a decline. As the price of foreign wheat was reported higher, Chicago rose by 2 to 3 jiao, and the distant month rose by a small 2 jiao. Canadian wheat rose by 3 to 7 jiao. Therefore, after opening, because foreign wheat rose sharply, general outsiders actively covered their positions, but the bulls ultimately felt that there were fewer and fewer actual chips, and there was no possibility of continuing to fix foreign wheat. Therefore, new records were seen repeatedly, and both insiders and outsiders believed that it was temporarily impossible. Each month continued to rise by 2 to 3 fen compared to the previous day. By the time the afternoon session opened, the market atmosphere suddenly became loose because the Shaanxi Incident might be resolved, and rumors spread that a certain country had a coup and Dalian prices were falling. Therefore, as these rumors suddenly arose, each month fell back one after another, falling back 5 to 6 fen compared to the morning's highest price and reaching about 1 to 3 fen compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for each month's contract of wheat futures showed a loose decline. When prices opened, because foreign wheat prices were still higher, rising 2 to 3 jiao to 5 to 7 jiao, few people in the industry paid attention because the market value had reached its peak, and outsiders did not dare to venture in to trade. Therefore, people's minds were calm, and each month fell by a small 1 to 2 fen. By the time the afternoon session opened, the market suddenly became unstable because the situation was expected to be resolved, and Dalian prices were also falling due to rumors of a coup. Therefore, bulls gradually sold off, and the market continued to fall by 3 to 6 fen. The current wheat market is weak because the standard has fallen back, and factories are very slack. There were only about a thousand bags traded throughout the day, and the price was similar to the previous day.</p>

<p>In yesterday's standard soybean cake market, many firms sold back out as soon as the market opened, followed by Dalian firms selling their positions, and the market gradually declined. In the afternoon, there were widespread rumors that a certain country had unrest, and telegrams from Dalian repeatedly reported declines, causing chaos in the market. Both covering and new selling competed to sell off, and the market price fell sharply again. The final closing price for standard beans fell sharply by about 1 jiao to 2 jiao, standard oil fell by 8.5 jiao to 9.5 jiao, and standard cake also fell by a small 3 to 4 fen.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments from various groups totaled over 90 numbers, with a total of 18,300 to 18,400 shi of goods. Among them, late rice accounted for over 40 numbers. Because of the scarcity of mid-grade goods, late rice was purchased very quietly, and high-quality materials were becoming lax. It is estimated that groups from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, etc., purchased around 5,000 bags. The price of mid-grade goods rose by 1 jiao. Due to price increases, buyers and sellers could not agree on high-quality materials. It did not open until 6:00 PM, with a difference of about 5 fen up or down. Only 400 to 500 bags of thick japonica rice were purchased. However, sales on this street were still good, so the price also rose by a few fen to nearly 1 jiao. Du Yangjian also followed up by a few fen. Yinyuan wine shops saw movement and stood out again.</p>

<p>Yesterday's government bond market saw a turning point in the situation, and the bullish trend became more intense. The trend also showed a sudden prosperous appearance. As the Xi'an Incident is expected to ease, the market sentiment improved, and the market sentiment was extremely firm. Buying became more active, and major players covered their short positions and turned long. Amidst the enthusiastic market atmosphere, prices soared, and the rise was quite strong. Unified bonds have gradually returned to the prices during a period of calm. However, because the rise was too rapid, it is very easy to react. Yesterday morning, due to the improved situation and strong market sentiment, major players like 37th and 18th were buying aggressively, and the 10th was even more actively acquiring.

<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets in Japan and the United States declined again. New York standard silk for December fell by 0.03, and May futures fell by 0.02. Yokohama spot prices fell by 10 yuan, and April futures fell by 11 yuan. Lyon silk prices remained unchanged. New York prices rose slightly, but silk trading remained strained. Yesterday, the local silk market remained cautious. Sales of white filature silk were very limited, while grey silk sales were slightly better, but silk prices were far below previous levels (grey silk was previously sold at 415 yuan before October).

<p>The overseas fixed price of Huisheng Iron suddenly rose to nine gold yuan yesterday (per box of 200 pounds), more than seven gold jiao higher than before. Local industry peers, due to the high fixed price, found it difficult to sell, so they generally did not dare to purchase it, resulting in little business. It is said that after the overseas surge, the Shanghai market has also been driven up by 1-2 yuan. For example, steel plate factories were selling at 38.5 yuan, Xin Steel Factory at 37 yuan, and "Ye Ji Huo" at 16 yuan, but due to the rapid price increase, transactions were also very rare.</p>

Only a few dozen bags of new Chaoqing sugar were offered by the Chao gang, priced at 13.5 yuan, which was 0.2 yuan lower than the price offered for road goods the previous day. It is also heard that Shantou production prices continue to fall, and the market is expected to decline further.</p>
<p>The joint venture company held its third tender for Guangdong sugar this week, with a total quota of less than 6,000 bags. 710 bags of Shunde factory Five Rams coarse white sugar were sold at 21.3 yuan, and 335 bags of Shantou sugar were sold at 20.9 yuan, with 120 bags sold at 20.7 yuan.

<h3 id="e205">The Permanence and Temporality of Youth <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Xing</p>
<p>There is nothing more precious in life than youth. Everyone has youth, but only those who can make use of it, live up to it, and maintain it forever can be considered exceptional and lead a fulfilling life. A woman's youth is an especially important stage in her life, a time when her happiness or misfortune, her expansive or narrow future, is determined. To "maintain youth" does not mean that women should apply makeup and wear fashionable clothes for the rest of their lives. Such artificial and material attempts at preserving youth are futile. We would find it ridiculous and laughable to see an old woman with permed hair and lipstick!</p>
<p>Since there are no immortals in this world, there is no magic to stop aging and decay. The youth that is visible in age and appearance is temporary. Permanent youth resides in a cheerful spirit and a fulfilling life. When your inner self and your environment are in harmony, you feel the vitality and joy of youth, even if you are middle-aged or near death.</p>
<p>A young woman is like a budding flower, full of fiery vitality and flourishing growth. However, these fragile shoots must be carefully nurtured, as they cannot withstand even the slightest damage. They need to be nurtured in gentle sunlight and abundant rain. But many self-proclaimed intelligent women are too eager to flaunt their youth. They often immerse this great, pure, and precious time in scarlet dreams. What do they gain in the end? Only disappointment, sorrow, bitterness, resentment, negativity, regret... and the hollow longing for a dream. After experiencing disappointment in marriage and love, they blame society for all their sins and misfortunes, claiming that society has deceived them.</p>
<p>If every woman could use reason to overcome the impulses of emotion, calm and complex thoughts, a serious and dignified attitude, a broad and sharp vision, and a steady and deliberate pace to resolve her ideal career and marriage during her youth, she would be able to obtain permanent happiness like that of youth, even though her actual youth has been entirely offered and consumed in her marriage and career. Spiritual youth will never disappear. What, then, is the value of fleeting pleasure and happiness!</p>
<p>Please do not yearn for unripe fruit. When you taste its bitter and sour flavor, you will regret it. Youth is like an express train speeding along the tracks of life. If you are not careful, you will miss your stop. This is definitely not the time to dream scarlet dreams.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Amidst the Enthusiastic Support for Suiyuan, a Nameless Lady Worthy of Our Emulation <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>The resistance in Suiyuan has already begun. A certain faction is now coercing traitorous Chinese collaborators to attack Suiyuan, our country's foremost line of defense. Fortunately, our loyal General Fu Zuoyi is leading his brave soldiers in a bloody battle against the enemy. We who are in the rear cannot join the front lines to fight the enemy like the women of Abyssinia. Of course, everyone should do their part for the country and the nation, expressing some patriotic enthusiasm. Here, I report to 200 million female compatriots! Good news worth emulating:</p>
<p>According to a Xiamen dispatch in this newspaper on December 1st, on the morning of the 25th of last month, a woman stood in front of the Jiangsheng Newspaper office, reading the posted newspapers for about half an hour. She then entered the office and took off the gold ring she was wearing, asking the newspaper to sell it for her and send the proceeds to Suiyuan to comfort the anti-enemy soldiers on the front lines. However, the woman did not give her name; the receipt only stated "anonymous." The newspaper then took the ring to a jewelry store, where it was valued at seven yuan. The newspaper also announced the public sale of the ring. Subsequently, Wu Potang offered to purchase it for fourteen yuan. Fu Weige, the manager of the Xiamen He Auto Company, offered twenty yuan to purchase the ring as a gift for his wife. There were also five young siblings named Zhang, Zhang Guomei, Zhang Jiamei, Zhang Yiwei, Zhang Qiumei, and Zhang Hengwei, who were willing to use their accumulated candy money of twenty-eight yuan to purchase the anonymous lady's ring. The above-mentioned gentlemen and ladies are all patriotic comrades who enthusiastically support Suiyuan. Furthermore, the Zhang siblings stated that if someone was willing to offer a higher price, they were willing to relinquish it. Mr. Fu has already relinquished the ring to the Zhang siblings and did not take back the twenty yuan, hoping to raise more funds to provide more assistance to the soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<p>Dear female compatriots! What is your reaction after reading about the anonymous lady in Xiamen taking off her gold ring to support Suiyuan? Hey! Remember a few days ago, didn't the women of Italy use gold rings to save their country? Well, then, let's do it! Hurry up and donate your jewelry to the government to strengthen national defense. Furthermore, Ms. Hua Xu in this magazine previously requested that you all save on cosmetics, perms, decorations, entertainment, and other expenses to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. This is what we should promote as "using spare rings to save the country." Perhaps this anonymous lady is our initiator! I hope that 200 million female compatriots across the country will participate in the "gold ring to save the country" movement. I believe you will all be happy to emulate it!</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Life of Japanese Bus Conductresses <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Japanese bus conductresses are the latest popular profession for Japanese women. Initially, after a commercial bus company in Tokyo hired women to sell tickets, business boomed. Consequently, Tokyo municipal buses and trams also used bus conductresses as a countermeasure. Now, bus conductresses are used for advertising all over Japan. Municipal bus conductresses are introduced by city council members and social workers, so strict selection is not possible. Commercial bus companies advertise for applicants and can select 20 out of over 500 people. Therefore, their appearance, figure, and health are better than those of municipal bus conductresses. About one-tenth (over 60 people) are graduates of higher girls' schools. The age of employment is from 16 to 18 years old, and they retire at 25, while municipal bus conductresses retire at 35.</p>
<p>The commercial bus company's bus conductresses receive 55 fen per day, a subsidy of 35 fen, and a commission of 26 per thousand for ticket sales. The municipal bus conductresses receive 8 jiao per day. Both earn about 30 yuan per month, with a maximum increase to 50 yuan. They work about 80 hours, with one day off every eight days. Young bus conductresses interact with male drivers and passengers all day long, which inevitably leads to youthful boredom and romantic incidents. Therefore, bus companies do not allow bus conductresses to live near the depot, and drivers and ticket sellers are rotated to prevent them from becoming too familiar. At the same time, supervisors disguise themselves as passengers to prevent incidents. After finishing work, bus conductresses must take a bath at the depot, not just to clean their bodies but also to check if they have hidden any money in their clothes. Each depot has two middle-aged women called "inspection site teachers." They not only have the power of life and death over the bus conductresses but also sometimes act as matchmakers. Because passengers who fall in love with bus conductresses often come to the depot to propose, the "inspection site teachers" become matchmakers.</p>
<p>The commercial bus company runs a Mingde Girls' School. All bus conductresses on vacation can attend free of charge, learning home economics, sewing, etiquette, national language, calligraphy, and other subjects. The municipal bus company also has floral arrangement instructors at each depot. In this way, the lives of Japanese bus conductresses are completely controlled by the company. In areas with more passengers, bus companies also send service girls to greet passengers. There are over 30 of them in Tokyo. They are the most beautiful and representative bus conductresses selected from the buses, and they serve at least as advertising. Standing gracefully on the streets of Tokyo, greeting passengers, is the latest tactic invented by the bus company.</p>
<p>The uniform of the municipal bus company's bus conductresses is a navy blue Western-style dress with a short top and a long skirt, which is very flattering. Each set costs 15 yuan. The municipal company quickly imitated them, but because they only cost five or six yuan ready-made, the bus conductresses were very dissatisfied. Japanese bus conductresses love to dress up. In addition to holding ticket clips, money bags, and scissors in their hands, they also have to take care of their hats and the corners of their clothes. Red lips, dark eyebrows, a few clear announcements of place names, and the swaying of their bodies in high-heeled shoes and the bus have captivated many passengers.</p>

<p>— (Huo Gu)</p>
<p>Women, you all occupy important positions in your families. Your every move directly affects your families and indirectly affects society and the country. Therefore, you should pay attention to your behavior. Now, I ask you to do something easy: save the money for a fireplace and donate it to the soldiers bravely resisting the enemy in Suiyuan.</p>
<p>In winter, a fireplace is almost indispensable for middle-class and above families for the purpose of heating. But in the current situation, as long as we think of the brave soldiers fighting bloody battles in the icy and snowy wilderness, we in the rear should not still be using fireplaces for warmth.</p>
<p>You are all progressive women, and I believe you will all accept my small request.</p>

<p>— Lu Zhizun</p>
<p>How to Predict the Signs of a Poison Gas Attack and How to Avoid It:</p>
<p>(1) When people near the battlefield suddenly smell a strange odor, they should be wary of a poison gas attack.</p>
<p>(2) When people near the battlefield suddenly see a sky-covering fog, they should be wary of a poison gas attack.</p>
<p>(3) When people near the battlefield suddenly hear continuous loud noises, they should be wary of a poison gas attack.</p>
<p>(4) When flowers and plants in the home suddenly turn yellow and wither, they should be wary of a poison gas attack.</p>
<p>(5) When dogs, chickens, and small animals suddenly die on the streets, they should be wary of a poison gas attack.</p>
<p>(6) There is no need to worry during stormy weather. Quiet nights with no wind or when the wind is coming from the enemy's direction are ideal opportunities for the enemy to release poison gas.</p>
<p>(7) Poison gas is heavier than air and flows to low-lying areas. Therefore, it is unreasonable to hide in cellars or basements during a poison gas attack. You should quickly seek high ground to take shelter. Roofs, tall trees, tall towers, observation posts, and mountaintops are all safer.</p>
<p>(8) It is unreasonable to stand still when attacked by poison gas in the field. You must cover your mouth and nose with a wet cloth and run upwind, or you may be able to escape the range of the poison gas.</p>
<p>(9) It is unreasonable to open windows and doors to look around when attacked by poison gas indoors. You must quickly close the doors and windows tightly, and plug any leaks with wet paper or cloth. If there is already poison gas in the room, you can spray the prepared alkaline solution, such as sodium thiosulfate water, with a sprayer, or spray it in your mouth to eliminate the poison gas in the air.</p>
<p>(10) It is unreasonable to only close the doors and windows when the house is surrounded by poison gas. You must close each room door tightly. If someone goes in or out, use a poison gas protection spray to protect them each time a door is opened, and the door must be closed tightly immediately after going in or out.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Essential Knowledge for Housewives: Prevention and First Aid for Coal Poisoning <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>The weather is getting cold! Most families are lighting their stoves. Wealthy families naturally use foreign stoves, but most families, due to economic constraints, can only burn coal balls for warmth. However, based on our past experience, the number of people who die from coal gas poisoning every year is considerable. Therefore, I am here to advise housewives to pay special attention to burning coal balls to avoid unfortunate events. Now, I will write about a few points that must be paid attention to when burning coal balls, and first aid methods for those who are unfortunately poisoned by coal gas. This can also be said to be essential knowledge for housewives.</p>
<p>It is best to light coal balls outside and move them into the room after the coal gas has dissipated. The windows in the room must be ventilated and must not be closed tightly. When sleeping, the stove must be moved outside. Otherwise, a basin of cold water should be placed in the room, because cold water can absorb coal gas. But I always think that moving it outside is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>If someone is poisoned by coal gas, immediately carry the person to a place where the air is flowing, and have him lie on his back while loosening his clothes. Give him sauerkraut brine to drink. The older the sauerkraut brine, the better. It is very effective to use it to treat someone poisoned by coal gas. At the same time, call a doctor for treatment. If the doctor is too far away, you can first apply artificial respiration to help him gradually restore his breathing, which can be saved, except for those who have been poisoned for too long. In short, in the event of such an unfortunate event, do not panic, but quickly try to find sauerkraut brine, perform artificial respiration, and quickly call a doctor. If you delay, it will be difficult to save!</p>
<p>Maids often like to secretly move the coal ball stove into the bedroom. Some even add a few more coal balls before going to bed because they are afraid of the cold. This is the most dangerous thing. Most people who are poisoned by coal gas are like this. Therefore, housewives must strictly warn their maids, explain in detail, and often check to avoid unfortunate events from happening.</p>

<h3 id="e213">A Few Words to Offer to Husbands <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Ling</p>
<p>After unfolding the October 31st newspaper and reading Chairman Chiang's "Reflections on My Fiftieth Birthday," many thoughts immediately emerged in my mind. I feel how important the responsibility of a mother is. In today's society, even though there is talk of gender equality, it has not actually been achieved. However, we should never be pessimistic or despondent due to the bad habits of valuing men over women passed down through generations.</p>
<p>A few days ago, we gathered at a friend's house and talked about the state of our family life and what our husbands were like. Some were animated, while others were unremarkable. When it came to Mrs. C, she frowned deeply, looking very sad! I am very familiar with her situation. She is a woman who received a good education. She has been married for five and a half years, but she is about to become the mother of her fifth child. Her husband works in a certain place, and they spend very little time together. Her husband is also a well-educated person. The slogans he shouts are "Renovation" and "Revolution." In reality, he is full of corrupt ideas, is stubborn and inflexible. He only returns home three or four times a year. He has no comfort for this gentle and hardworking wife, and he doesn't express any affection. He only treats his wife as a servant, and he always says things that pierce the heart: "Women? What are women good for? Except to be used by men as a source of pleasure." He also dislikes her for having too many children, for losing her beauty as a woman, for not having charm, coquettishness, or anything else. In his eyes, a 26- or 27-year-old woman has aged beyond recognition, so he often complains about her and hates her. In this situation, what joy does C have in life? What courage to move forward and what hope for a bright future? She has been working hard for her children, raising the children she has already given birth to and caring for the unborn fetus. In a family with limited financial resources, she tries her best to save money and manages the housework in an orderly manner. Because of excessive childbearing, she has indeed lost her health. After all her hard work, she hopes to get some comfort from her husband, like a withered branch waiting for irrigation. But what are the results she gets? Bitter tears; feelings of grief and indignation; Her experience almost made her determined to commit suicide. But when she looks back at this group of children who are crying and waiting to be fed, how can she bear to embark on this dead end? While sympathizing with her pain, I often advise her: "Everyone has their own responsibilities. No matter how difficult the situation, you have to be patient. The responsibility of raising these children is too great. You shouldn't sacrifice your own life for him alone and abandon your task as a 'person.'"</p>
<p>Writing this, I have a few words to offer to the husbands in general: A harmonious family is not created simply by the wife's obedience, docility, adherence to chastity, and not crossing the line. Husbands should also abide by the morals that people should have, and they should not naturally submit to fierce women. When they meet gentle women, they bully them in every possible way, do whatever they want, regardless of everything, thinking that in the era of male power, women's status is not worth mentioning. Wives, of course, also have conditions that should be observed. "Cultivating one's character, managing one's household, governing one's country, and bringing peace to the world" - the family is the foundation of society. Wives bear the heavy responsibility of managing the family and raising children, which is not a trivial matter. Husbands should encourage their wives, comfort them, and allow them to wholeheartedly strive for the sake of the family. It is not right to hold that self-deprecating mentality, to be tyrannical, exaggerated, and to exercise unreasonable patriarchal power in the home. If husband and wife respect and love each other, wouldn't there be fewer shortcomings in the family?</p>
<h3 id="e214">Persecution Suffered by Modern Professional Women (Part 2) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Li Shouzhen</p>
<p>Secondly, female teachers in general schools, female staff in institutions, and female office workers in various professional sectors often cannot do more important work based on their abilities. In an institution, when the same work is assigned to two employees of equal status, the work given to the male employee is always more important than that given to the female employee. Is this a special favor for women? This is merely a kind of insult that belittles women's abilities or a means of suppressing women's development. Their employment of female staff is not from the standpoint of using talent, but to use them as mere ornaments. People slander the female staff of various institutions as "vases." Is it that women willingly become vases? It's just a bunch of bored men using their despicable mentality to insult women.</p>
<p>What's worse is that when a young woman with thoughts and a mind has just stepped through the door of society, she receives a love letter from the east, a request from the west, a bunch of annoying entanglements, and a shameless smile from the west. Those with willpower struggle all day long, constantly angry, and try to eliminate these dirty deeds by all means. As a result, they cannot move forward quickly in their careers and find it difficult to develop their future quickly. And what about those who are a little weaker in willpower? They eventually give in to the harassment. Then a group of men shout that women are useless, scold them for being depraved, and slander their purpose of seeking work and careers. In this way, many fathers and brothers use this to suppress their daughters and sisters, and they slander other people's daughters and sisters, so that their fathers and brothers also suppress them in the same way.</p>
<p>Thus, we can see the treatment that modern women receive and the contemptible cruelty of society towards professional women.</p>
<p>Now, I hope that our female compatriots deeply understand their position and their personality, and summon their courage and perseverance. As long as we can recognize that we are individuals, then we cannot retreat because of the persecution of others and fail to fulfill our obligations as human beings. The stronger the external pressure on us, the greater our resistance should be. We should not take those persecuting facts as great pressure. We should look at those few compatriots who have struggled out from severe oppression. As long as we have determination and courage and do not accept people's hypocritical charity, but do as much work as we can with our own ability and get as much benefit as we can, people will lose the opportunity to humiliate us and will have no excuse to slander us. Even if they want to suppress us in any way, it is impossible. Female compatriots! Never give in, never compromise, never retreat. One day, society will realize how foolish and inhumane their past persecution of women was and realize that mutual respect and mutual help are the virtues that human beings should have!</p>
<h3 id="e215">Private Secretary (Part 2) <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Xueying</p>
<p>That evening, Shao Yi arrived home at approximately 9:45 PM. Her father was sitting alone on the sofa downstairs, seemingly waiting for her return. Since that evening when Shao Yi argued with her father, she hadn't spoken properly to him, only greeting him briefly when they met. At this moment, with no one else in the downstairs living room, her father couldn't help but speak first:</p>
<p>"Of course, I support you working, but girls are not like boys, and you need to be more careful when finding a job. Where are you working now?"</p>
<p>Shao Yi, of course, could no longer ignore this question and gave a brief explanation, not mentioning at all how the Mr. □ invited her to the theatre or dinner, nor even that there were only two of them in the room. Her father felt much relieved when he heard it was a miscellaneous journal, and he added a few words in his usual condescending tone, nothing more than telling her to come home early, not to socialize with people casually, and to be frugal in her dress.</p>
<p>When Shao Yi was resting alone in bed, she felt her mind filled with many strange thoughts that she had never had before. And at the center of these thoughts was always the Mr. □. Although her father's words were still ringing in her ears, they had very little power. She did not believe that this kind of socializing that arose from work would have any significant consequences. She understood the Mr. □'s strange attitude, thinking it was the usual courtesy that employers showed to a private secretary, with the aim of stimulating her loyalty to her job.</p>
<p>The next day, in the overly opulent New Moon Magazine office, the Mr. □ told her that he hoped she could keep all business, writing, and social secrets, while focusing on her work. He would give her long-term preferential treatment and increase her salary in three months. This dispelled some of the doubts that Shao Yi had initially harbored, and that afternoon, he solemnly instructed Shao Yi to write three English letters, officially starting her work.</p>
<p>The work of a private secretary proceeded smoothly, and the various courtesies Shao Yi received increased day by day. In addition to her regular monthly salary, he also gave her clothing materials, gloves, watches, and so on, almost exceeding her salary by five or ten times. But Shao Yi did not find it strange. She gradually developed a misconception that a "private secretary" was the closest friend, so she believed that Bao Rong—that is, Mr. □—should treat her like this, and she should enjoy it.</p>
<p>A month, two months, passed quickly. Although her father had become suspicious of many aspects of her dress and behavior, and had questioned her several times, she always fobbed him off with various lies, faithfully keeping all secrets for her employer. Her father had no choice but to sigh angrily for a while.</p>
<p>Later, the misconception that a private secretary was the closest friend evolved into the fact that a private secretary was a secret lover. Shao Yi felt that Bao Rong was really too good to her, and that just working for him was not enough to repay him, so she gave him all the comfort he asked for. And Bao Rong's economy was extremely unusually abundant, and without much effort, he moved the New Moon Magazine office to YuYuan Road, expanding it into an extremely modern new home, openly cohabiting with his private secretary.</p>
<p>Since things were like this, Shao Yi's father could no longer criticize them, and he made a very simple request, which was to urge them to quickly hold a wedding ceremony. Shao Yi repeatedly urged Bao Rong about this, but Bao Rong prevaricated in every way, and also inadvertently revealed many loopholes that he already had a "wife at home." Shao Yi remembered many of the things her father had asked her before, as well as the various lies she herself had told, and really felt she had no face to tell her father again, and could only try to endure it, until her first son was born in the hospital, and she was still a "private secretary" to Bao Rong, with no legitimate status.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Nine Flowers Mountain Netherworld Bell <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>From the newspaper, I saw a very large advertisement, the Netherworld Bell on the top of Jiuhua Mountain, will be cast on December 30th, the birthday of Amitabha Buddha. This is the only huge bell in our country. The preparation time, it is said, has been two or three years, the weight is more than ten tons, when struck, the sound can be heard within a hundred miles. Our country lags behind others in everything. Now there is this huge bell, which can also be called a "most" in the international arena. Compared with the United States' fondness for calling itself "first," it is really not ashamed. How can it not be called a national event!</p>
<p>I have considered the purpose of the Netherworld Bell. It is to startle the countless ghosts of the netherworld with its grand sound, so that they can quickly awaken, turn back to the shore, and ascend to the Western Paradise. In my hometown, if a woman dies due to childbirth, her husband or children must ask the temple to strike this bell for seven days and nights. It is said that if they don't do so, the dead ghost will be forever trapped in the "pool of blood and filth" and will not be able to transcend. When striking the bell, a large oil tank is placed under the bell, with rush lights lit, floating on the oil. Above it hangs a paper-扎 woman, with disheveled hair, looking extremely terrifying. Watching the oil fire flicker, listening to the faint bell sound, being there in person, shuddering, one truly feels like they have arrived in the netherworld. Besides this, I have not seen it struck for other things. It seems that the temple's preparation of the Netherworld Bell is specifically for awakening the women in the netherworld who have died due to childbirth. Now, the various great philanthropists and Buddhist disciples in the country have made a grand vow to cast this huge bell on the top of Jiuhua Mountain, and its meaning is naturally different.</p>
<p>Counting on my fingers, in the past ten years, how many people in our country have died in internal wars? How many have died under the enemy's slaughter? How many have died in droughts and floods? And how many have died in unclear, dark massacres? If hell really exists, I am afraid that hell is also full. Gathering these countless ghosts, in the gate of hell, they will not be very peaceful. If Yama really exists, I am afraid he will sigh that it is difficult to govern. Now there is a huge bell, with its grand sound, faintly reaching directly to the ground, the ghosts will hear it and their bones will soften and their muscles will become weak. Yama can then calmly send them away, saying: "Each of you go to the Western Paradise, do not linger here, creating trouble"! Thus, the ghost world can achieve peace.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Noble Old Man <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>Every time I pass through that square, I can always see a strange old man.</p>
<p>He is only about three feet tall. If it weren't for his slightly hunched back, you would never believe he was nearly fifty years old from afar. On his small, wrinkled face, he wears a pair of unusually large glasses. A cluster of Japanese moustache is high on his lips.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Almost all year round, he wears the same oil-stained and dusty tailcoat and a top hat with a high crown. However, the high temperature of the tropical region forces him to frequently put it on and take it off. He holds a small cane with an iron head in his other hand, walking solemnly with his head held high and his chest puffed out, as if he were going to a banquet of some celebrities.</p>
<p>On his weak, ridiculous face, there is often a red glow of alcohol. Because he feels that living in Manila is as boring as being in the desert, he often drinks alcohol. However, he does not forget that when he discovers a gentleman-like person from afar, wandering from one end of the square, he quickly straightens his collar, which is almost as charred as coal ash, puts on his top hat, braving the sweat on his head, and walks in the opposite direction, pretending that nothing is happening. When their distance is about twenty feet, he earnestly and solemnly stands aside, a smile floating on the corner of his mouth, bending the hand holding the cane behind his back, and extending the other hand to take off the top hat from his head, tightly贴贴 it to his chest, giving a ninety-degree bow.</p>
<p>"Good morning, sir"!</p>
<p>The one who is called a gentleman will be surprised and frown. They will often suspect that this strange little old man is either drunk or wants to ask him for some "balas" for alms. Some, in order to avoid trouble, will often reach out to take out their wallets. But he will never reach out to receive it immediately. He wants to appear very polite, approaching his face, walking and rambling.</p>
<p>"Sir, you are mistaken, I am not that kind of person..." he says in an apologetic tone, indicating that although he is dilapidated, he still comes from a noble family. "The reason why I am willing to approach you, sir, has a more sacred reason." Then, he coughed lightly, excitedly knocking his cane on the ground. "What I want is not a few balas for alms" he swallowed a mouthful of saliva and said again. "What I want is to tell you, sir, that in this dry desert of Manila, there is still a beautiful flower, and that is Miss Sally. She, a noble Spanish aristocrat and a mixed race of noble Filipino blood; because of poverty, she began to receive her respectable guests. Sir, if you don't mind, you can spend the lowest price to talk to her or do other interesting things..."</p>
<p>For excitement, his face flushed red, and he stared at the small eyes covered by thick glass, looking at the guest. When he finds that the guest is a little bored or wants to leave, he nods frequently and gives a ninety-degree bow.</p>
<p>For curiosity, or for the ridiculous appearance of this old man, bold gentlemen are led to meet his "beautiful flower." And he will be very excited, talking about all kinds of interesting things, or reciting his own glorious past like a recitation. From this, everyone knows that he is also a noble Spanish aristocrat and a mixed race of noble Filipino blood, and that "beautiful flower" is his own biological daughter.</p>
<p>"Before in Nueva Ecija province," he said in a sad tone: "We had a coconut plantation worth two hundred thousand US dollars, but now I have nothing, fifteen years ago, the High Court, at the request of the bank, declared us bankrupt."</p>
<p>They stepped on the small streets of Quiapo, filled with dust, walking windingly for about three or four streets.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Don't Be Greedy for Cheap Things <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Elderly Person</p>
<p>"Cheap things are not good," this is a sentence we often hear. Since "cheap" things are not good, we should not be greedy for "cheap" things, especially medicines. It is difficult to have good efficacy when taking cheap medicines, and perhaps adverse effects will occur! Just like the current seasonal cod liver oil, some small pharmacies use low prices to promote sales, but this kind of cheap miscellaneous cod liver oil is not refined well, and its preparation is harmful to the stomach and intestines, so please don't be fooled! So, if you don't buy cod liver oil, you should buy real good cod liver oil, or go to the Five Continents Pharmacy. Because the Five Continents brand of milky white cod liver oil is precisely tested by the blue reaction method, and the vitamin content is rich. The Five Continents Earth brand of malt extract cod liver oil is refined with pure cod liver oil and high-quality malt extract, etc., and the taste is sweet, so the society trusts it the most.</p>
<h3 id="e219">A Small Love Story <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Xiulan</p>
<p>Mr. A and his wife have a very good love. One day, after Mr. A's wife put on makeup, Mr. A stood behind her, stroking her hair and said:</p>
<p>"Your cloud-like black hair,</p>
<p>Sprinkled with 'One Three One' hair water,</p>
<p>A gentle breeze blows,</p>
<p>The fragrance permeates the lungs!</p>
<p>I love your cloud-like black hair,</p>
<p>I love that 'One Three One' hair water."</p>
<p>Mr. A's wife smiled happily when she heard these compliments.</p>
<p>(Note) There have always been very few high-quality domestic hair perfumes, and ladies who love to use domestic products generally consider it a pity. Since the advent of the "One Three One" hair perfume from the Five Continents Pharmacy, its fragrance is more elegant than the highest imported products, so now almost all ladies use this kind of hair perfume.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>, he stopped in front of a basement, valiantly climbed down the扶梯扶梯, let the guests follow behind, and pushed open the door.</p>
<p>In the basement, there was only a narrow room about ten feet long, surrounded by a few simple pieces of furniture, there was a sofa bed, a table, and a cabinet inlaid with a dressing mirror, although it was dark, it was still clean. When the old man entered the door, he called out in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Sally, dear, I brought you guests..."</p>
<p>A half-naked young woman, fat and short, jumped up from the sofa bed like a ball.</p>
<p>"This is Miss Sally, a beautiful flower..." The old man introduced in a touching tone, took the guest's coat, cane or hat, put it in the cabinet, politely gave a bow, retreated to the door, sat on a stone step, smoking a cigarette in his mouth, his head lowered to the ground, ready to hear any cries inside, and went in to serve.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, that door trembled slightly, opened, he was suddenly shocked like he was hit by a stick, hurriedly stood up from the stone steps, retreated to the side and solemnly gave a bow, and said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Now, sir, please give some money for the wine..."</p>
<p>In less than a quarter of an hour, he appeared in a basement bar, holding a cane in one hand and a top hat in the other, frequently nodding to the people present.</p>
<p>The "Aid Sui Photography Exhibition" organized by Ao Enhong, Lu Fu, and Lu Yu is open to the public in the Daxin Company building starting today until the 30th. The left is "Shadow of Car" taken by Ao Enhong.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Shopkeeper Liu <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>That was when I lived in the east city, I met Shopkeeper Liu.</p>
<p>His age was not very old, but he had a short beard that he had grown quite long. He had the active emotions of an "old young man", often making faces and coaxing the children to laugh when they were having tantrums. If the opportunity arose,—so-called opportunity meant after drinking alcohol—he might even climb on the large kang, a specialty of the north, let the children ride on his back, while hummming on his back, his big buttocks would constantly swing from side to side, like dancing the hula.</p>
<p>Of course, it was not just a little bit like that. The north's large courtyard has quite a large horizontal area. The sun sets on the west wall, and the children living in the courtyard all set out on their way. It's not as good as everyone liked to play hide-and-seek at that time, and it was extremely important to be fair to the person who was hiding. For this, he would also sit lightly on the stone platform with his big buttocks, acting as the judge of fairness. There was a period when they got tired of playing hide-and-seek and switched to "leading the dragon's head" (also called the old eagle catching chickens). In order to protect the small creatures behind the dragon's head, the position of "head" was very tight, and this role, of course, belonged to him.</p>
<p>This house with three courtyards was pawned by him with more than two years of hard work. The owner of the house was from another village and had been empty for several months, unable to rent it out. However, the old man who guarded the house needed a few dollars a month to get rid of him. Later, because he was waiting to repay the debt, our Shopkeeper Liu pawned it at a very small price. One pawn was for ten years! What is worth thanking is that it was this pawn that gave us the opportunity to live together and to recognize his face.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper is a collective name for small-scale businesses in the north, like the southerners call the boss. He opened a "oil and salt shop" with two door-faces directly opposite where we lived. This kind of shop can't be seen in Shanghai. Its nature includes most of what people call the "seven things to open the door," tall counters with some oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and all kinds of green vegetables, etc. inside. Because in the north, small vegetable markets are rare, so the oil and salt shop took the place of the small vegetable market. Many also partnered with "rice and noodle shops", which naturally gave people more convenience in purchasing.</p>
<p>After that, we gradually came to know the philosophy that Shopkeeper Liu embraced. Because of the relationship in the same courtyard, because of his relationship with the children, his shop became the object of purchase for the same neighbors and nearby. In this way, he easily drove away the other one.</p>
<p>I remember it was spring, when all things were breeding and growing, sparrows were singing harmonious songs in the courtyard, jumping from the tile window to the roof and the treetops, very cute, freedom made them happy, so they were flying in nature. The children could not see these little things. They wanted to catch them, but where could they? Later, they thought of a proper way to catch their cubs from the tiles, raise them, and enjoy them themselves. Soon, this method was passed, but who would catch them? Here, our Shopkeeper Liu took over a burden.</p>
<p>A large tea几几加ded to the eight immortals table, and then a small round stool added to the tea几几. He stood on it, opening his mouth, and stretched his arm into the tiles that sparrows often entered and exited. Suddenly a black thing窜窜 into his mouth, panicked, fell down, his mouth tightly closed, his hand still tightly holding the tail of the black thing, fainted, blood flowed out of his mouth,呵呵 was a small black snake!</p>
<p>Even when I went to Tianjin to study, his throat was not well.</p>

<p>Tao Luo Si Delilio's new film "Sorrow of the Sea of Desire" will be released in Nanjing Grand Theater starting today. Tao Luo Si is known for her hot and glamorous nature. In this film, she plays a knife-wielding actress, even more radiant. Co-starring Little Fan Bonk, it is the first time that these two big stars have co-starred in a film. The film tells the story of two women who hate each other due to jealousy, and just at that time, a murder case occurs. So they are imprisoned, unjustly accused, and die innocently. In addition, there are several grand song and dance scenes.</p>
<h3 id="e225">In "Eternal Smile," Hu Die's Three Peking Operas <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Red Thread Stealing the Box, Yutangchun, Huilong Pavilion</p>
<p>In "Eternal Smile," Hu Die plays a Qinhuai courtesan, who is gentle, beautiful, and passionate.</p>
<p>She is a singer, so in the middle, she sang three operas. At the beginning, while happily playing on Zijin Mountain, she sang "Red Thread Stealing the Box". The following two scenes, "Yutangchun" and "Huilong Pavilion," are all sung in the opera venue.</p>
<p>For these three Peking Operas, Hu Die has been practicing for more than two months. Hu Die originally sang Peking Opera very well, but because she hadn't practiced for a long time, she spent two months practicing these three operas in order to make "Eternal Smile" even more perfect.</p>
<p>The placement of these three operas in "Eternal Smile" is necessary. In her singing, the plot of the play continues to unfold. In her first song, the carriage overturns in the spring field.
