<p>（南京）日前同盟社發表之消息、略謂中日交涉中之各問題內、有五項已經雙方在原則上予以同意、此五項問題、乃航空聯絡、改訂入口關稅、取締朝鮮人之非法行動、聘用日本顧問、取締排日各點一節、記者茲從可靠方面得悉、中國方面對於五問題之態度、的略如下、</p>
<p>（一）中日航空問題、係指上海與福岡間民用航空聯絡問題、此事日方提議在九一八以前、去年中國交通部與日本遞信省亦曾數度商議、本平等互惠之精神、擬有草的、惟自去冬以來、日本飛機在我國北方各地、未經合法手續、自由飛行、影響我國領空主權甚大、中國政府認爲在此種事態未終止以前、甚難進行滬福聯航、政府此項態度、迄今未變、</p>
<p>（二）中國入口稅之改訂、爲中國內政上之事，政府所定之關稅、本可斟酌國家財政狀態與商業情形、隨時爲適宜之調整、惟中國政府在研究關稅之調整時、當然以走私之停止、與海關緝私之自由爲首先應予考慮之事、</p>
<p>（三）關於取締朝鮮人之非法行動、中國政府固不願任何外國人在其領土內有何非法行爲、惟同時朝鮮台灣人及共他日本國籍人民、在日本勢力庇護之下、爲非法行爲者，日方當局自亦應加以取締、</p>
<p>（四）關於聘用日本顧問事、中國政府自動聘用外國顧問、胥視政府需要與被聘人之技能而定、初無國籍之分、中日邦交果已好轉、中國自動酌聘日籍技術人員爲專家、非不可行、但此非可以由外國政府要求之事、</p>
<p>（五）關於取締所謂排日、中國政府曾一再以敦睦邦交誥誡人民地方官吏亦均認眞執行、今後人民果有逾越範圍之行爲、中國政府自當繼續依法取締、惟人民悄感之發生、自必有其原因、日方苟能改變對華政策、眞與中國携手、則一切所謂反日行動、自可完全消滅、而誠摯之友誼、當可常存於兩國人民之問也、（六日中央社電）</p>

<h3 id="c47">遺產稅的立法原則 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>中政會日前通過遺產稅原則十項送立法院審議不久當可完成立法程序明年春間此項新稅或將開微我們曾經說過遺產稅是近代稅制上的一種良稅但是在這立法過程中間我們却還小能不顧慮到此項正在草創的新稅將來能否推行盡利我們以爲立法當局對於微收方法不能一味求着便利否則實行以後窒碍一定很多願就所見提出兩點如下。</p>
<p>第一遺產稅有總遺產稅制和分遺產稅制的區別兩者各有利弊前者的優點是稅率單純調查和微收的手續簡單財政上的收入也較多其缺點則爲不問繼承人的多寡及繼承人和被繼承人的親疏關係而對同額的總遺產微收同額的我這和租稅的能力原則及負担公平原則不甚脗合後者按繼承人和被繼承人的親疏關係及繼承人的多寡而定稅率的高低旣很公平又合租稅的能力原則其缺點則爲調查和微收的手續比較繁複財政上的收入也此較短少兩者之間應怎樣抉擇各國雖立法不同但採取前者的已不多見而一般趨勢則是兩種制度混合採用我國遺產稅固然應從國庫收入有利方面着想但也不可不力求符合租稅的能力原則和公平原則因此兼採上述兩種徵收制度的長處實有必要。</p>
<p>第二在法律學上雖有新制定的法律在國境以內可以分期分區實施的理論但是把這種理論採納於遺產稅法中流弊很大因爲遺產稅法如果分期分區實施則屬於同一政府之下的國民在同一時期對國家會有不同的納稅義務這不但違反了租稅負擔公平的原則而且實行結果徵收遺產稅區域以內的遺產繼承者爲要逃避納稅羲務勢必多向尙未徵收遺產稅的區域內移住這又會使戶籍法和兵役法的執行加上一層困難今年春間財政部擬定的遺產稅暫行條例有「本條例之施行日期及區域以命令定之」的規定如果這含有分區實施的意義那是應當修正的。</p>
<p>以上兩點我們希望立法當局在創制遺產稅法的時侯加以注意此外在遺產稅的推行上政府方面也還得有幾種必要的努力例如戶藉法應當嚴厲　行現行民法對於姓名權的保障應當予以限制使入民不能利用固有的習慣用花名把財產化整爲零以逃避納稅義務而政府對於國際方面也應有相當的努力使人民不至於托庇國際勢力逃避納稅義務然而這些却不是立法範圍以內的事了。</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之三十九）</p>
<p>（六）李茂昌機器銅鐵床廠淸理召盤該廠成立於民國七八年間，迄今已十六七年，資本定額的爲七八千元，係李蓮財君獨資創辦，雇有工人十五六人，全部機器設備的値三千餘元，開業以來，初時範圍較小，徉經李君慘苦經營，基礎始漸穩固，其出品銷路大抵以京地各旅館爲主，近年來外受不景氣影響，內受同業間競爭打擊，是以營業日减週轉困難，虧負甚鉅，不得已乃淸理召盤。</p>
<p>（七）中國鉛絲製造股份有限公司成立該公司係陳景塘張松山君等所發起，蓋鉛絲一物，我國年需甚巨，然國內尙無人設　製造，每年均賴國外輸入，故陳君等爲提倡生產杜塞漏巵計，爰乃聯合同志創設中國鉛絲製造股份有限公司，在滬設廠製造，所有股份悉經各發起人分別認足，並於本月十日正式成立股東會公選江一平，陳景塘，方液仙，張松山，朱如山，戴畊莘，張麗靈七人爲董事，及邵景甫，項美瀛一人爲監察人云。</p>
<p>本月份販賣商業類新創者較上月增　家，閉歇者較上月份增二十家，情形似又轉惡，其主要原因，乃爲棉致布西服百貨三業之衰落所，其較重要之異動計如下列</p>
<p>（一）鴻昌廠布號暫停營業</p>
<p>該號創業於民國二十一年迄今已逾四載，經理爲鄭曉鐘君，平日營業尙稱發達，歷年亦屢有盈餘，最近因股東間意見紛歧，波折叢生，經理與股東之糾紛允爲重大，致營業無法繼續，不得已暫吿停業外界殊　惋惜云。</p>
<p>（二）偉大綢緞局開幕　該局爲綢業鉅子劉銘嘉，郁仲肥，沈棣生等發起組織，於本年春着手籌備，租南京路廣西路口之店基，自行改建鬥面，於上月始吿工竣。復經積極布置，業於本月二十日開幕，內部共分綢緞，新裝，邊飾，襲料，批發，郵售，禮券各部，規模宏大，設備新潁，足爲綢業界後起之秀。</p>
<p>（三）同康祥洋貨棉布號暫停營業該號開業有年，範圍殊大，採合夥組織，由股東徐鳳儀君兼任經理，資力雄厚，於同業中素著聲譽，平日營業亦稱發達，不意最沂突有內部組織關係，宜吿停業淸算，且負責人分別出走，致各債權人大起恐慌，聞已組織債權團進行交涉云。</p>
<p>（四）振大昌紗綫號開張該號係紗業聞人顧錫堃，邵惠康，吳慕廉等合夥創設，規模宏大，資力雄厚，專營中外棉紗各種粗細股錢棉絲毛冷開士米絨等各貨，以及棉　廠針織廠各種原料，並精煉絲光染色等，業於本月三日開業云。</p>
<p>（五）源豐潤香燭號停業該號係張戈源君獨資創請，規模宏大，爲燭業中之巨擘，其聲譽之高，歷史之悠，幾爲滬上人士所共知，聞開張迄今，業已有二十餘年，加以經營得宜，年有盈餘，並先後於杭州普陀設立分店，因此地位益固，外界存欵，陸續增加，張君乃將游餘資金，另設天德堂藥號，及內地輪船公司，詎知均遭失敗，虧蝕甚鉅，張君經此打擊，元氣大傷，雖該燭號仍有盈餘，亦杯水車薪，負債纍纍，經濟週轉困難，而債權方面，復先後控救法院，由法院執行查封，雖經張君竭力向各僓權人疏通，並建議將債權移作股份，俾得重振營業，但終因債權人態度强硬，無法挽回，於是此煊　一時燭號乃忍痛倒閉矣。</p>
<p>（六）中華國貨公司開慕訪公司爲實業家周北麟周景康等發起，資本額定爲國幣二十萬元，內部計分綢緞，皮鞋，針織，棉織，呢帽等部，間有租與其他經營者，規模頗大，亦爲國貨業中之勁旅云。</p>
<p>（七）北福洋行開幕　該行係日商所設大規模商塲，專售絲棉毛織物，化妝品，玩具，文具等物，開業於本月二日，據云該公司擬次第於虹口及其他重要區域分設分行云。</p>
<p>（八）便宜商塲閉歇　該商塲甫於本年三月十日開幕，迄今僅及半載，忽吿暫停營業，聞訪商塲原係各國貨廠商聯台創立，其性質初非一永久之組織云。（未完）</p>

<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>（一）前言</p>
<p>民國改建以來，中央財政，確已有不少進步。如二十三年度之財政報吿，今又發表矣。此爲民主國家之政府，對於人民應有之義務。非此不足以謂爲人民服務，又非此不足以謂對人民負責。然在前北京政府財政秘密時代，則不可得矣。</p>
<p>惟依歷决報吿所言，而爲吾人所急欲明瞭者：今日歲出入之大量膨脹，其因果究爲如何？較前進步者何在？進步之程度又何若？蓋稅收增加，未必卽稅制進步之說明。而歲出膨脹，更不能斷謂政治進步之結果。今日政治之較前猛晋，固毫無疑義，但其是否確已合乎經濟之原則？似亦可有檢討之必要。</p>
<p>卽就財政範圍言財政，則財務行政之效率，現已達於何種程度？整理稅制，執行預算，調撥金融，給予公私經濟之影響又如何？最理想之財政，應不以「徵收」作爲公經濟之歲入基礎，必須能自行「生產」，以集積財富，而又不與民爭利者爲上策。但舉世各國，能如是者甚尠。更新中之我國，常要不能遽抱此種奢望。但良好之財政，至少須收支平衡。又非僅以收支平衡爲已足，允須求其收支之每一文錢，直接間接上皆能與人民發生良好之關係。故「取之於民」後，必須「用之於民」；又應考慮其如何　取」法？如何「用」法？「取」「用」關係之必需合理，旣爲全國人民所殷殷熱望；又爲今日當道所懸爲施政方針，則吾人之探究，更應恪守此一點。抑且際今非常時期，若不亟早調整；使「取」合最小犧牲之原則，保留自由伸縮之彈性。「用」則合於最大福利之原則，而又確能充分經濟，充分合理。旣有滴應非常環境，完成非常使命之機能。父能確保公私經濟之自然發展，立下承平應變之健全基礎。非此，則不知將如何而得言「救亡圖存」？</p>
<p>茲篇所述，主亦探明近年中央財政之眞相，及其「取」「用」關係之現狀。故側重於材料之整理與分析，檢討其發展之過程與外射影響之散佈。不尙空談，亦不欲評斷。並以狹義之財政爲範圍。所舉各項數字，皆根據財政年鑑，經濟年鑑，歷次會計報吿書（以上皆係官家數字）及申報年鑑，與　士毅之民國財政史正續編等書，相互參照，分別抉擇，而自行重編與核算；以求「取」「用」實數之發現。故所得結果，與公報數宇，頗有出入。因公報者以國庫直接收支之凈數爲主，而吾人所欲注意者，爲國庫直接間接上所有收支之總數。本文之所以題名爲「眞相」者蓋此。際今公報發表之初，想國人亦樂於作進一步之檢視。故假本刋寳貴之篇幅？公諸同好。因作者才力谫陋，謬誤在所難免。尙待督碩有以敎我！</p>
<p>（二）財政膨脹之激流</p>
<p>國民政府成立以來，中央歲出，逐年膨脹；已爲衆所周知之事。當十六年度預算實行之日，其時歲出之决算額僅一億四千八百萬元。然在本年度（二十五年度），歲出预算額巳躍升爲九億九千一百萬元。如以十六年度作爲指數基年，則本年度指數卽爲六六九·六；卽年前激增五十七〇％；換言之，卽激增五倍上。十年來每年平均歲出額，計爲六億三百萬元；足供過去四五年之總費用。允以三四年來之歲出額，足當過去六七年之總。十年來之平均歲出指數亦達四六二·一％卽較前增加三倍半以上以說明·歲出膨脹於此可見。</p>
<p>歲出旣已激劇膨脹，歲入当亦强度提高。蓋理財者，認爲公經濟之所以不與私經濟相同者，卽在前者爲「量出爲入」，而後者爲「量入爲出」的一點耳。</p>
<p>十六年度時，中央政權，尙偏於江南一帶；故歲入決算額謹八千萬元（限於稅收等正常歲入；債款等收入在外）；其後各省反正，全國形式統一。，又支付鉅大之補助費，以交換財務行政權之推廣與集中。此項交換，於國庫收支上固未必實患，但爲財政制度上所應然。　統一之國家，建設現代之國家，財政權之統一與集中，實爲最起碼之要件。財權之統一與集中，各年歲入乃日漸增大；但因無實惠可言，而歲出之膨脹又如上述，乃不得不努力於提高稅率，增闢新源。如以十六年度之歲入額作爲一〇〇時，則十年來之平均指數已激升爲七八九·三；卽平均增加六八九·三％；較歲出額之增加率允大。如以本年度對十六年度言，則增加率且達八六二％。卽較十年前增加八倍半以上。</p>
<p>歲入之歷年增加率，雖較歲出增加率爲大。但其絕對數字，卽歷年之歲入額，則遠不若歷年之歲出額大。十年來每年平均之歲入額僅五億六千六百萬元。歲入最大之年度亦僅七億七千萬元。但較之十年前，歲入額僅數千萬元，固已激增六七倍之多；而與歷年之平均歲出額六億三千五百萬元相較，則每年之收支不敷額，平均尚有一億萬元以上之鉅，僅此收支不敷之額，幾已可供十年前任何一年之全部歲出矣。</p>
<p>不僅此也，收支不敷，且成爲我國財政之常態；無年或有例外。而不敷之額，又年有增加。如以民十六年度作爲指數基年時，則本年度之指數已達三二六·五；卽較十年前增加二二六·五％；十年來之平均不敷指數爲二一三％；卽較前平均增加一一三％。試觀第一表－歷年中央歲出人决算額及其指數（單位百萬元）</p>
<p>（註）（一）民六至十四年度係北京政府時代者。歲出决算額，根據其時財政部會計司乃關鹽兩署所直接支付之軍政債三費的總和之平均年額。（二）民十四至十五兩年度，係廣東及武漢之國民政府時代者：以下則爲南京國民政府成立以來之各年度。歲出入皆係决算數字，惟最近兩年度則爲概算數。（三）歲出項中包括政債各費外，又將歷來報吿中剔除之坐支徵收費，上年度結欠而由本年度支付之款，以及暫記各欵；在十七年度，復有發還各欵。一并計算在內。而將結存之現余扣除。以示國庫之實支額。（四）歲入項中句刮稅收及國有事業投資等收入外，又將歷來公報中所减除之坐支徵收費加入；而以債欵收入，及其他臨時歲入，本年度歲人結欠，等數扣除之。以明國庫之實收額。（五）不敷額，係以歲出額扣除歲入額後之餘數爲準。故債欵收入額亦包刮在內。</p>
<p>向者，每談平衝預算，必云「開源節流」。回顧歷來歲入之激增，可知「頓理稅收」，設法「開源」，成績業已卓見。然歲入增加率，較歲不之增加率，大出三二七％的塲合，而結果尙出足以維持收入平衡；適足以表示國民納稅力本質貧乏之弱點。</p>
<p>誠然：國民纳稅力，原中國之所有及所得所構成，所有及所得之增減，爲國民經濟盛衰之結果。是以財政基礎，必須建築於健全的國民經濟之上，方可維持於不敝。然財政制度之優劣，財政活動之影響，亦足以支配國民經濟之興衰。蓋兩者實有相因相成之關係，則歷來財政恐慌之强化，吾人更有研究其內在弱點之必要矣。</p>
<p>（三）歷年增收計畫之效果</p>
<p>據覽十八年度以來各年度之預算，與決算相較；歲入方面，實收數輒較預算數少百分之十以上。此種現象，可作兩種解釋：一是由於歲出之過度膨脹，不得不多估歲入預算額，以便減少預算書面上之大虧空。二或許在每次新的增收計畫之下，估足其希望：而結果總未能如願以償。此種事實，正足以說明國民納稅力之不堪從命；而由財政的立塲言，對於歷增收計劃，亦有切實改造之必要。</p>
<p>「註、預算决算之歲入額，皆不包括債欵收入在內，</p>
<p>吾國歲入，以稅收爲主體。固無待言，故歷來一切增收計劃，莫不以稅制爲唯一目標。亦爲意中事。歷年來籍「整理稅制」，而事擴充：就稅收額之增加上言，確已有莫大之進步。如十八年度之稅收額僅　億一千六百萬元；十五年度憶激敎增爲六意八千萬元。八年來激增百分之六十三又五。而允以最近四年來之增加更爲劇烈。十八年至二十一年度四年間，平均稅收年額爲四憶丸千二百萬元，卽四年間平均增加百分十七又五。但二十二年度至二十五年度四年間，其平均稅收年額已激增爲六憶五千二白萬元。平均堆加白分之五十六又六。</p>
<p>稅收之激增，旣如上述，但在歲入總額中之地位，則反日見下降。如十八年度稅收對總歲入之比率爲七六·六％；二十一年度且增爲七九·九％：此四年間之平均比率爲七五·二％。然在此後四年間，其平均比率已减爲六九·九％；如二十三年度僅六六·七％；二十五年度僅六八·八％。此種現象，實足以說明僅恃增稅之一法，遠不足以應付大量膨脹中之歲出要求，試看第三表：</p>
<p>不僅此也，歷年之所謂「整理稅制」，要不外乎嚴密緝私，及提高稅率，或增闢稅源。就租稅之財政原則上言，是否合乎經濟？尙屬疑問。其影響於國民經濟者，且置勿論。試觀十八年度以來，財務費之激增，其勢之急，亦不下於稅收之增加率。如第四表。（單位百萬元）</p>
<p>由此可見八年來之財務費，平均已增加三一·五％；允以鹽務方面，雖因日僞等之霸佔東北鹽政：仍以關內積極整理鹽塲，添辦鹽警，建築倉坨，嚴密緝私；故其費用增加最大，達七四　％之之鉅。東北關政，雖亦被佔；然其費用，亦增加二一％。統稅方面，因近年增　新稅源，故徵牧費亦大增。八年來平均增加三八·五％。除此三大稅外，他若礦稅印花菸酒稅之事務費％亦一律激增。礦稅事務費，十八年度僅二萬六千元；二十五年度激增爲五十三萬四千元。增加十九倍以上。八年來之平均增加率亦在一一〇·一三％之高峯。印花菸酒稅事務費，十八年度時僅三百五十五萬元弱，二十五年度已增至五百二十萬元强，增加百分之四十七；八年來平均增加率且爲五四·三一％，然其增大財務費之總效果，僅使總稅收平均增加百分之五十六强而已。如就各稅而言，則稅收增加率最大者，亦推礦稅。八年來平均增加一二四八·七六％其决推統稅，平均增加九六·四％；復次爲印花菸酒稅；平均增加四一·〇九％；更决爲鹽稅，平均增加三二，五％。關稅則平均增加二〇％。試觀第五表（單位千元）</p>
<p>租稅在財政上，必須所付之徵收費少而能稅收大者，始合乎經濟之原則。乃普觀各稅，除統稅事務費平均僅佔統稅稅收額百分之四以外，其他皆佔百分之十以上。如二十年度之礦稅費佔稅收額二八·六八％之多；八年來之平均比率亦達一六·九一％；二十二年度之印花菸酒稅費佔收入額一九·〇二％；八年來之平均比率則在一七％以上。鹽務費平均佔收人一二％；關務費平均佔收入一〇·二六％。財務總費，平均作總稅收亦達九·七八％之多。近年雖有下降之勢，但如二十五年之稅收總額，因財務費之歲出，亦將打一九五折。試觀第六表。</p>
<p>各稅務費佔本稅收入額之百分比率</p>
<p>備註　根據第四－五兩表統計者。財務費之比率，係對稅收總额者。</p>
<p>孔財長在二十三年度之報吿書中會謂「對於：稅收機關，或行改組，或予合併，以期節省開支，改良行政；施行以來，頗著成效。財務行政費，業已較前减少，與稅收比較，其比率在二十年爲百分之十一，在二十一及二十二年爲百分之九·九；在二十三及二十四年則爲百分之九·二」。比率雖較吾人所統計者，似尙過低。惟此種趨勢，確已養成。不能不謂今日財務行政進步之處。然回顧第四表，緊縮下之今日，尙遠不能與過去相較，尙望當局，能加進一鞭。</p>
<p>且就歲出中言，財務費之支出，幾等於其他政務費之總額全部；有時且尙超過之。數額之大，僅决於軍務債務兩費之下。其爲財政上之一大負担，自無待言。在此籌備國防及積極剿匪時期，軍務費正唯恐其無法增加，當無再行縮减之理。債務費有關國家信用，並保留彌補今後財政虧空之餘地，亦難於節减。則爲平衡預算，健實財政計，唯有縮减政務費及財務費之一途。縮减政費，並非普遍减薪之謂，在减薪之外，實更應從事於裁併冗關濫員；是則於改造行政系統，增加行政效率上，大有貢獻。</p>
<p>况財務費之支出，實等於全國民爲給養稅吏而對之納稅。各稅之專務費，實卽附加於各稅而徵收之附加稅。今日國家之全部稅收中，有百分之九點七八，卽爲財務費而所課之附加稅的收入。是以各稅務費在本稅中所佔之比率愈大，卽其附加稅之稅率爲愈高。爲蘇息民困，輕减稅率計，自應先得此項附加稅率加以降低。</p>
<p>不寗唯是，今日稅牧之增加，尙非得力於財務費提高，而使行政效率得以增進之結果。試就鹽稅爲例。</p>
<p>近年對於鹽務之整頓，可謂不遺餘力，整理鹽塲，建築倉坨，廣設稅警，無一不使鹽務費增加：而其目的，則在防止走私，企圖增益稅收。根據第五表，最近八年來，鹽稅收入，已平均增加三二·五％；然根據第四表，鹽務費之支出，則平均增加七四·一％。付出二份之代價，而僅得一份之效果：正可謂「事倍功半一。其得不償失，已顯然可知。若以緝私費之頻年激增，而全國之放鹽量，仍所增極微。允可說明其效果之薄弱。試看第七表：（單位百萬元及担）</p>
<p>八年來，緝私費平均增加十一倍：放鹽量僅增加九·五％；投下十一倍之緝私費，僅將百分之九又五之私鹽，緝爲官鹽而已。而鹽稅之平均增加率，則爲二九·五％：另一面，鹽稅率却提高六五·三％。可知稅收進步率，遠不及稅率增加率大；而緝私之　大功能，也許僅防止因稅率激增而將逃稅之新私鹽而已。代價若是之鉅，而效果不過爾爾。可知提高稅率，嚴密緝私，顯非得計。彰彰明甚。此項預象，恐非獨鹽稅爲然也。</p>
<p>誠然，走私原屬犯罪行爲，如非因稅負過高，民不堪命，誰願再挺而走險？鹽爲人人日常必需消費之食料品，謂稅於　，在財政立塲言，本爲一大好財源。以全國四億五千萬人，每人年食鹽十五斤計，則全國每年放鹽量，至少須六千七百五十萬担。如稅率實施新鹽法所規定之每市祖二元五角；則全年稅收亦可達一億六千三百萬元。稅率旣降，走私者當减；如再以較經濟之徵收各費，從事於改革運銷及緝私諸事，而充分提高其行政效率。則財政上所得之實惠，必較今日多；而人民生活上之負担，則已大形輕减矣，</p>
<p>况租稅之　國民生活上的利害，形如雙鋒之利劍。其右鋒可以摧殘國民經濟，涸竭本稅稅源；左鋒則能扶助國民經濟，培植國家財源。故爲禍爲福，惟在如何使用其一鋒耳。</p>
<p>（四）歲出內容之轉變與期望</p>
<p>前已言之，近十年來中央歲出，巳平均增加三倍半以上。其增加率最大者，在過去，首推軍務，財務，債務三項經費。但自二十二年度以來，增加最大之內容，已有所變更，若經濟行政費，文化敎育費，行政司法費，補助費等，皆在急速增加中。此種轉變，實爲今日中央財政較前大見進步之現象。亦未始非受國難之刺激，而幡然之表現乎？試觀第八表</p>
<p>歷年各項歲出權算及其指數與比率（單位千元）</p>
<p>「注」（一）北京政府時代包刮民二，三，五·八·十四年；上數係該四年概算之總平均（二）補助費包括蒙藏費在山　，（三）財務費在北京時代將債務費也列入。（四）文化敎育費，前稱敎育經費，或敎育部主管經費，（五）經濟行政費，包刮交通，實業，肆設，國營姿本投姿。昔日則包刮農商，交通，實業。十八年度復有工商，農鑛，衛生等名目。（六）行政司法費，包刮昔日之外交，內務，司法；或曰各機關經費。今日則包刮國務費，內務費，司法費，外交費，撫恤費等。（七）比率係各項經費對當年度之歲出總額計算而得。（八）指數則以民十八年度爲基準。</p>
<p>國民納稅，認爲應盡之義務者，目的非全爲維持國家之行政組織，乃欲此而得保障生命財產及一切事業生活，並有充分改善及發展之便利。而國家亦根據此種貢獻得有向國民賦課租稅之權。不論國家之起源及其現實之本質，並非如此。然現代之政治思想，莫不以此爲圭杲。故國家賦課租稅，必須合乎最小犧牲及最大福利之原則。而國家之使用稅款，亦必須合乎最小犧牲及最大福利之原則；申言之：良好之稅制，使人民納付時所生受之犧牲感覺小且可得以期待最大之福利。國家乃將收人之稅欵，在最低的代價下支出，藉以維持及創造最大之公共福利；而實踐其對國民應盡的職責。如是社會乃得以繁榮而向上，國基乃得以健實而鞏固。財政亦可以維持而不疲。故國家之歲入的本質，只是財富之流通，歲出之本質，實等於無形的或有形的生產投資。且以有形之生產投資額愈鉅，四財政之基礎愈健全，而創迭之福利也最大。是以歲出經費之配置，實爲國家政制優劣之關鍵。</p>
<p>乃普觀國歷年之各項歲出而言。歲出項中。近九年來，軍務費平均佔總歲出額四〇·二九％；債務費佔三二·〇五％；兩者合計達七二·三四％。補助費，大部份實亦具有軍務費之性質。平均佔六·二三％。則併計達七八·五七％。財務費，行政司法費，黨務費，可統作爲政務費。九年來之平均比率合計爲一三，〇四％。上列各費，就現狀而論，本質皆與純消費無異。此外兩費，在生產上較具積極作用，但其比率合計僅八，五四％。</p>
<p>但民二十二年度以來，軍務費已遁減三六·五五％；近四年之平均比率減未三七·九八％。債務費絕對額雖减少無幾，平均比率則已减爲二七·五％。補助費，在此時期，則已激增五三二·八％。其平均比率爲八·六三％。三者合計，其比率减爲七四·一一％。</p>
<p>在此時期，財務費絕對額雖亦减少無幾，比率則降爲七·一七％；行政司法費絕對額則已激增四九·六％；惟其平均比率仍不過三·六九％。因過去此項費用爲數甚微，略一增加，在總大量膨脹之歲出中的地位，雖極微細。但在縱的比較上，則已覺其增進之速。如加入黨務費，則此三費，本期內之平均比率，合計亦已减爲一一·四七％。</p>
<p>惟文化敎育，經濟行政兩費，本期內皆已一律激增。前者之絕對額，增加一九八％；平均比率已擴大爲三·五％；後者絕對額則激增一六四八·六％；平均比率增擴爲一一％。兩者合計，本期同之平均比率爲一四·五％。絕對額之增加率，速於平均比率之擴大，其故與行政司法費之增加同。</p>
<p>就國家之職責言，不論文物，法制，敎養，保衛，皆應積極舉辦。允在我國，百端皆廢，更應同時並進，切實整頓。惟際今民窮財絕，而又內憂外患交作之日；如欲百政俱舉，勢所不能。則權衡輕重，擇要先行，實爲必趨之途。則吾人對於歲出重心之正在轉變，大可額手相慶。</p>
<p>唯就財政之觀點言，吾人對於今日之轉變，父不能不重生新愁。蓋正因民發財絕，故每一動靜，更應如何確守經濟原則？不能藉民意所歸而有浪費，使財政作不絆濟之膨脹，而陷入更大之恐慌。或依各機關進行事務上之方便，卽擴大規模，增設組織，添聘人員，造成官浮於職，職廢於各關係機關之相互牽制：事限於財耗於冗關監員之薪給支出。即擾亂完整之行政系統，減損行政之效率，且虛耗國帑，加強財政之危機。此種現象，在經濟行政上，不幸竟頻頻發生。</p>
<p>何廉氏曾研究今日中央行政組織之調整問題（其論文發表於南開大學之政治經濟學報四卷三期）時，對於中央各行政組織之複雜與混亂，曾詳列事實，力言其不當。而認爲經濟行政上之機關林立，責任分歧爲允烈。則可見在此急速膨脹中之經濟行政費內，必有大部份虛耗冗關濫員之薪給的支出上。是以爲增進行政效率計，固應調整行政機構；爲平衡預算，撙節浪費，補充合理之歲出計，亦應調整行政機瑞，以爲實踐「節流」諾言之手段。</p>
<p>「五」歲出入膨脹於財政上</p>
<p>正常歲入之激增，而尙不足以應大量膨脹之歲出要求旣如彼。連年國庫收支不敷額之鉅又若是，於是平衡預算之手段，唯發行國債，調撥信用是尙。</p>
<p>近年國債之激增，依孔財長之報告：「大半用於償還舊債」；又曰一各年度　短數目，大部份可與償還債務支出相抵」。此實爲借債還債之忠實說明。</p>
<p>不僅此也，歷年償付之債務額，尙不及新債之發行額大。因不特以發行新債爲彌補預算虧短之手段，抑且將所有未及收入之稅欵，亦轉化爲庫券或借欵，以支付亟待支付之欵。最近十年來，每年平均發行新債三億一千九百萬元；幾等於十年前兩三年之總歲出。舉債額大於還債額及不敷額，危險較「借債還債」允烈。孔財長之報吿又謂「所發之新債券，因係照票面貶價發行，實際上利息奇重。而國家稅收之經指定爲新債之担保者，亦日見加多」。誠非親歷其境者所能想像之苦。試觀第九表：</p>
<p>（註）單位百萬元，二三年度前係决算數，後爲概算數，新債中包括內外債及借款與未還額，負債滾存包括實業公債；本年度滾存數以三月末爲準。並皆以年歷計算，本年度新債中包括復興，四川善後，及因發行統一公債而中央得每年减少債務費八千五百萬元之數，總加之和。</p>
<p>據此可知每年負債之增加率，最低較上年遁增一二·一％；最高其遁增率且達二二四·二％，如本年度者然。其平均遞增率爲五六％。十年來，發行增加率爲四四三·三％；負債滾存額增加率爲五丸六·一％；十年以後，國債滾存額必將超過一百億元。國債之增發與流通，實能促成通貨膨脹。（其理請看社會經濟月報三卷七期拙著第四節）據中國銀行報吿書謂「全國銀行之有價證券數，的當全國銀行實收資本之數；甚至有超過之勢」，而此有價證券，實皆爲公債券。再者，銀行承受公債之手段，常恃增加其紙幣發行，有資者及收公債後又常　化爲有欵；國家以公佔之收入支付於民間，再增銀行之民間存欵·存欵增大，又助於增發通貨。通貨流轉中受恐慌之襲擊，再凝結爲食利資本。結果，現金準備率只减無增。通貨之流轉將皆化爲帳面資產。於是膨脹之實利未得，膨脹之基礎則已養成。債息及物價之兩重威脅，乃使財政歲出之膨脹，每無止境。國民除向國家納稅外，乃又須向國家之債權人納稅矣。</p>
<p>惟今日歲出上之漸變其重心於經濟行政，從事於生產之投資；已使財政上收獲相當之良果。近年來之歲入門中，除稅捐及債欵之兩大收入外，國營事業及投資利得收入額，亦已漸見其增益之勢。苟當局再能回此新方針邁進，財政基礎，當有轉危爲安之望。試觀第十表：歷年歲人內容之分折。</p>
<p>（註）其他牧入包刮國有鐵路收入，銀行官股利息收入，及本年度之歲入結欠。</p>
<p>上表所示，可知在近七年來，稅拍雖佔歲入中最高之地位，但其增加率則最低。唯逐年　增，除受九一八事變及最近之華北武裝走私風潮等之發生時，才有例外之下降。但因加強他方之稅收，爲彌補此項之損失：故下降率亦不大。債欵在歲入中之地位，僅次於稅捐：然其比率，與稅捐同樣有下减之勢。惟其他收入，過去在歲入中渺不可論者，近年有日見重要之勢。雖其中包刮歲入結欠在內，足使吾人不易　下論斷。但就大體言，未始非歲入項目亦有轉變形勢之證。此正爲吾人引領以望者也　　二五，一一，三〇·，晚</p>

<p>本年九月十三日，病歿於滬上之徐固卿先生，因是淸季曾充陸軍第九鎭統制，辛亥攻寗，又被推爲江浙聯軍總司令，追隨總理南下護法，任廣州衛戍總司令，兼練兵督辦，故人皆以爲是一赳赳武夫。詎料徐先牛並非陸軍出身，幼時因其尊人子遠公，是經師而兼名幕，博涉多通，受其庭訓，亦甚勤讀，而研求宋儒之學。十九歲已受懷遠縣之聘，而充刑名師爺，公餘研究典籍，除集門徒，立學會，孜孜講誨外，又精研醫理，有疾輒自療。並中式光緒甲子科舉人，入桂藩游子大張光宇李勉林諸方伯幕府，李勉林升贛撫，的其至贛，遂入仕途，以道員佐李查辦江西敎案，三月內結二千餘件，於是稱其能，遂令其長講武館，而總辦營務，統領新軍。當時先生曾以未習軍旅而固辭，李中丞以其素治老子之學，請以此學治兵必無敵，曾有得名將易，求儒將難之語，請其勿辭。自是以後，所至皆掌兵事，文學反被湮沒，除在贛總理營務處外，在粵統領常備中軍，在閩總辦軍政局，在江南總辦參謀敎練兩處，兼統常備兵，手定新軍編制章程，及典範令等，而辦微兵。所部將校，多懷革命思想，如黃花岡鬱死之趙伯先，在皖起義成仁之熊成基，骨充皖督之柏文蔚等，當時均隸渠部，江督端方指名拿辦，均由其營救而脫險。近雖任國府委員，因病，常養疴滬上，自號學壽老人，並著學壽堂文集詩說詩集等書以自娛。</p>

<p>×××路夙有「神秘之街」的稱號，因爲那邊有着異國的姑娘，出賣伊們的肉體：也有着國產的男婦，幹着那種有傷風化駭人聽聞的秘戲；此外咖啡館，跳舞塲，賭窟，烟窟，……也另有特殊風光，所以博得那神秘的徽號。可是自「一二八」以來，市面的不景氣和那警局捕房的嚴厲取締，這種種神秘的勾當，再沒有從前般猖獗，因此這「神秘之街」的稱號，也有些名不副實的了。</p>
<p>去年和今年，這「神秘之街」的附近，鬧着兩件國際暗殺案：而且被殺的便是身膺護僑重命的糾糾武士。「張天師被鬼迷」，面子上有些說不過去。於是一方面向我市府交涉；一方面向市民示威，這×××路五步一崗，十步一哨，槍實彈，刀出銷，坦克車，機器車，不停地巡廻，頓時佈滿了緊張狀態。住在附近的居民，嘗過了「一二八」那晚的滋味，於是逃呀！逃呀！逃到租界的中心，逃到內地的鄉間，這×××路頓時冷落了，十室九空，行人寥落。沿北的一段，店家十有五閉，再不聽到舞塲的音樂聲，水手的喧鬧聲，妖姬的笑語聲。……在行路的人也滿躭着心事，倘使一不小心，便有池魚之災。住在路旁的人家，也宜火燭小心，萬事謹愼，丟下一顆桂圓核，潑下一盆洗臉水，不但有違警章，且有軍法從事的危險。這夙稱神秘的×××路，因了這層緣故，居戶惴慄，行人戰兢，竟可以稱它做恐怖之街。</p>

<p>— 曼子</p>
<p>國民革命的歷史，是悲壯的，離開現在還不久，我們容易憧憬着。但是我們要一個深切的留念，雖然是舊事重提，却是一種很好的歷史敎科書。</p>
<p>「生死同心」，就是寫革命的前夜，軍閥的殘暴，和革命同志的奮鬥，當然是沉痛的史蹟。導演應雲衛把這可以想像得到的故事，處理得非常的尖銳化，因爲他用全力在緊張的情緒上發揮，所以看過這影片的，沒有一個人不嚴肅地期待事實的展開，足足一小時，連氣也喘不過來，直到最後革命軍勝利，纔得從歡呼中還復了窒息。可是得到的恐怖，或者要經過更多的時間，纔得淡忘。所以在軟性電影的迷氛裏，這是一張異軍突起的影片。</p>
<p>我們不必附會到國防問題上去，可是國防要有犧牲一切的民衆，要有百折不回的民衆，而鼓勵民衆，要有强烈的刺激和興奮，「生死同心」就負着這使命，所以在國難嚴重到最後的生死關頭，我們應當把「生死同志」作爲提撕驚覺的敎科書的。直截痛快地說，「生死間忠」是國防敎育的一本參考書。</p>
<p>我們記得國民革命軍最大的助力，是宜傳工作，「生死同志」是寫宣傳工作的成功，而未成功以前間遭逢到的挫折，就是現在中央陸續表揚的諸先烈的不同而同的型子，那麼生死同志也可以說是中國國民黨黨史的代表作。</p>

<p>— 范顯微</p>
<p>『高枕無憂』這句俗話，原是形容一班優遊歲月的人，『衣無憂』『食無慮』，但我現在所說的高枕頭，却並不是這樣；從前着實也出過大風頭，公開睡過不少年數，睡得上去，的確瀟酒出塵，優者游哉！不過現在時代改變，這種高枕頭，却不得再睏下去，已變爲高枕有憂了，這高枕頭，雅號又呌『聰明枕頭』，就是一班癮君子常睡慣的，油汚起碼有二分高，哮吼鼻涕來時，一榻橫陳，吹吹吹幾筒一抽，撥動靈機，精神抖擻，憑你想不出的難題，解决不來的事件，自會得迎刃而解，因機利導，奠是妙哉靈丹！</p>
<p>年來政府的禁令，一步緊一步，據說：明年起，如再有入私睡高枕的話，那腦袋就要請你遷居咧！何况這本年來是無底洞：整千整百的良田，三進四椽堂的華厦，如花如玉的「嬌妻」，活潑玲瓏的愛子，儘量地着得下，用盡那花花鈔票，結果還要身羅法網，實在是何苦呢！奉勸一般黑籍的同胞，快快猛省吧！</p>
<p>有人說：咱們中國人，體育不發達，喜歡睡高枕頭，也是原因之一，的確，我們日常所睡之枕，至少有半尺來高，所以弄得個個彎腰曲背，造出一大批，一大批的駝子來，樣式眞摩登！須知枕頭愈高，背心愈曲，那肺部自然不會怎樣發達，體格那得再會强壯？這也言之有理，所以不獨癮君子不要睡高枕，就是一班普通人，也是不相宜；卽使擺不了他，還是低些爲妙！</p>

<p>第九回　惡耗驚聞人如花落溷　芳踪頻到心是絮沾泥</p>
<p>在十二點鐘已過，國器覺得是傳信的人，不會再來。吃過午飯以後，拿了一本書，隨便翻弄幾頁，更是增加了心裏頭一層煩悶。那微微的風，將窗戶外的竹廉子搖撼着不停。從那個動作裏面，遠遠的有拉着很長的蟬聲，渣渣的送了過來。當那太陽强烈的白光，照到天井裏時，聽了這種蟬聲，便有日干很長的感觸，人也情思昏昏的想要睡覺。於是移了一張藤椅，正對了窗戶睡下。也不知道是經過了多少久的時候，耳邊却聽到咚咚的幾下嚮，睜開眼時，看到門簾干外，有半截花衣服，立刻站起來向外面點點頭道：李女士嗎？請進來罷。自己這樣的說着，可是趕快把衣鈎上的長衫取下要穿上。鬥外劉媽答道：先生，是我。國器的長衫已是穿起來了，這倒不好又脫下來問道：你敲我的房門作什麼？劉媽笑道：那個敲門，我是在壁上釘上兩根釘子。國器道：不過你把我吵醒了也很好，我正要出去。說時，揉揉眼睛，正待掀廉子出去。劉媽在門簾縫裏看到，因道，先生，你出去嗎？家裏有客呢。國器道：家裏有什麼客？劉媽道：李小姐老早來了，在老太太屋子裏坐着。他說要和先生借一部書看，先生醒了，就招呼他一聲。國器笑道：你說話不淸楚，弄得我也糊裏糊塗。你去吿訴李小姐，要什麼書，只管來拿，我在這裏等着，不出去了。說到這裏，自已覺得格外有一種高興之處，把剛才埋怨友梅失信的意思都給忘記了。摸摸領子，牽牽衣襟，也不坐下，靜等着友梅進來。偏是友梅的態度，非常和緩，總在十幾分鐘之後，他才隔着門廉子，他先呌了一聲表哥，然後緩緩的掀了門廉子進來。大概因爲天熱的關係，他並沒有梳長辮子，在頭心上挽了一個蝴蝶髻。上身穿一件長畏的淡靑洋紗褂子，雖然，他是個肌肉豐滿的人，也透着身材苗條。未知他臉上是不是搽了胭脂，但是臉腮上已透出兩塊紅暈。他進來了，就向國器微微的一笑，鞠着躬道：表兄，今天沒有以去嗎？（一零六）</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>祗要想起了四年以前的「一二八」那一回事，我們誰都不會忘記了大塲，因爲大塲和廟行在當時都是軍事的重心地點，所以到現在，那過去浩刦的創痕，和戰後的殘蹟，還隨處都能够見到。</p>
<p>我在這時亦是鋒鏑餘生之一，因此四五年以來，那一幕殘酷的，慘痛的印象，永遠也不會在自己的記憶上消失的；只消自己一走到那些地方，就會想起了這些來。目前，綏遠的砲聲又在響了，從前在南方演出的把戲，如今又換了一個方式到北方去搬演了，我們回首往事，那新創舊痛都一齊兜上了心頭。</p>
<p>在一個沒有太陽的日子，我們由那輛滬太長途汽車馱着，從烏鎭路橋出發，經過中興路，太陽廟路，中山路，最後便爬上了那條漫長的滬太路；脫離了都市，漸漸地向着大自然裏前進。車窗外的河流，田舍，樹木，却閃電一般的向着後面倒退下去。</p>
<p>車子到了大塲，我們就一擁地走了下來。我們道决的到大塲來，大家都還是第一遭，所以不但路徑不熟悉，而且方向也有點不大明白，但好在我們本來沒有一定的目的地，只放開着步子，任着脚尖兒闖去。我們在車站那兒拐了一個灣，穿過了一條巷子，就可看見一頂水泥橋，那頂橋是在一二八時被燬後由某君捐資重建的，因此在橋欄上全刻着被燬原因及捐資人的姓名。走下了橋，便是大塲鎭了。</p>
<p>大傷的鎮市雖不怎樣大，但也相當的繁榮的，什麽酒館，醬園，行號都有，不過市容好像不十分整齊；我們在街上巡禮了一週，覺得那些酒店中和茶館裏也倒並不見得怎樣冷落，過了鎮，在市梢頭豎着一座很高的牌坊，知道那也是爲了紀念復興市鎮而建築的。</p>
<p>鎮的後面，有一個很大的農塲，該塲佔地的二三百畝，裏面樹苗及畜牧種類頗多；並且，一片一片，淺綠如茵的草地，和一條一條蜓蜿曲折的河流，中間還有許多亭臺等點綴，所以這雖是一個農牧場，但却也擅園林之勝，尤其是在春季或夏天，我相信那裏的生活環境一定是很好的呢！</p>
<p>從農塲里出來，經過保安隊隊部，一羣隊員正在賽籃球，隊部後面也有一個小小的園林塲，上而豎着一塊「我們的園地」的牌子。</p>
<p>聽鄕人吿訴我們，離鎭三四里仍一座寳華古寺，那兒是値得一玩的。於是我們向鄕人問明了路徑，我到了寳華寺；寺固然很大，僧侶也衆多，並且那寺也好像「一二八」之後重建的，因此房舍還保存着新的痕跡。各處都有白龍山人王震先生的題匾，寺後有一個院子，那裏面除了一個很大的放生池，和亭臺樓閣外，還有一條河流。</p>
<p>在寺裏參觀了一番，回出來已是進暮的時候了，但舉目田野，竟找不到了歸路，後來穿了好幾處的田塍小徑，纔步行到了餘慶橋，總算在餘慶橋等到了最後一班回上海的滬太汽車，被帶回了上海。</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實</p>
<h3 id="c185">兩性歡樂中的健康問題 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>……白面書生和病美人大都性能薄弱已為情場的落伍者　……健康有力為兩性歡樂的唯一前提青年不可不加注意</p>
<p>健康是一切事業的基礎、更為兩性歡樂唯一之前提。科學告訴我們：只有健康的人方有充足的性機能。有了充足的性機能方能營適當的性生活，以獲得兩性間至高無上的歡樂。於是人類遂一改擇偶的條件，審美的目光。</p>
<p>舊時代的標準美男子是白面書生，肢體瘦削，手無縛雞之力。新時代的標準美男子是軀幹雄偉，肌肉結實的偉丈夫。舊時代的美女要弱不禁風，常帶病態；現在卻要康健紅潤，乳高臀挺。舊式的美，文雅得很，然而像這種男子往往發育不全，性能薄弱，患著遺精早洩陽萎等病，不能使妻子得到滿足。那種病美人更多患月經不調，性感冷淡等症。</p>
<p>性的滿足是人類天然的大慾。在那種因體格關係而無法滿足時，夫婦間的感情自然不會增進，兩性的歡樂無法求得，貌合神離以度其凄清的一生，這是弱者的辦法。強者則私通，仳離，以造成慘劇。</p>
<p>現代有科學知識的人都深知這問題的重要，所以擇偶審美，以健康為第一要件。一個發展平均的康強的體格表示生殖腺的健壯。健壯的生殖腺表示性機能的健全和成熟。白面書生和病美人，不過虛有其表，已為有識者所不取。這些不幸的男女，必得從速挽救，否則是無緣消受異性之愛的。</p>
<p>請先言其原因，大抵不出於先天不足和後天斷喪（手淫或私通），結果均使生殖腺萎弱，發育不得不中止，陽萎早洩和局部短小，遺精等症遂一齊出現；在女子方面則經期紊亂，性感薄弱，或竟缺乏。</p>
<p>這種衰弱的男子必需速服『希米脫氏固精片』，先治其遺精，懶得對於射精作用的控制力。再進一步服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，使生死腺恢復健壯，陽萎早洩必愈，發育重新進行，局部不致短小。</p>
<p>女子也有女性生殖腺素製劑『女用生殖素』，能調整經期，根治性感冷淡症，促進發育，使乳峯高聳，完成健美的體格，缺憾方可消滅。</p>
<p>如此用科學方法加以挽救後，生死腺強壯，內分泌旺盛，非但性機能健全有力，全身健康，也有顯著的增加，逐鹿情場，決不致再落人後。</p>
<p>（編者按：『生殖素』及『希米脫氏固精片』概裝鐵盒，其紙盒瓶裝者均係偽藥，切誤購。）</p>

<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>淋病的治療，一向認為極困難，實因略為大意一點，即有殘留淋菌於體內的危險。殺菌不盡，急性淋病將轉為慢性淋病；更有發生各種併發症，或傷害性神經面釀成性神經衰弱，或損壞睪丸而致絕嗣。所以於著手治療之前，不可不先行致應如何方可根治的問題，實際上這無非就是擇藥的問題。</p>
<p>首先，我們還是選取內服藥呢，還是選取注射藥？以前注射藥確佔優勢，但其經應用的不便利，卻無可諱言，如有優秀的內服藥，總以內服者為好，病人可以自行吞服，注射就非找醫生來動手不可了。</p>
<p>那麼第二個問題在選取怎樣的內服劑，我們可以提出幾條標準來談談。</p>
<p>效力的強大應當先回考慮，必須擇其確有殺滅淋菌的能力。藥性的和平也很重要，否則難免有副作用發生。最後，因係內服劑，須不傷胃腸的方可服用。能完全條例這些標準的藥，惟有黃色素和伐克辛合製劑的『安敵淋』。藥性和平，無損胃腸，一方確具透膜殺菌的充分能力，一方併能於血液中產生抗毒素，增加抵抗能力，所以收效極宏。</p>
<p>此外有補助藥二種，亦所應知。以淋病而致性神經衰弱，可服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』女子淋病，多有自帶，宜自行外用坐劑『療帶靈』可使白帶絕跡，腔道清凈。</p>

<p>— 呂一飛</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>半年以前，我還是一個面黃肌瘦，皮包骨頭的所謂老槍。大半天的時間，都橫在那張煙榻上，一燈如豆，照著黃色的帳子，灰色的臉，和一絲絲的煙霞。然而禁煙事業的推進，不禁令我神明內疚。每一記從前的學校生活，教師們如何耳提面命的講述著煙毒禍人之深，那時自己不是也深惡痛絕這害人的雅片的嗎？不知怎的十來躲在家裏當大少爺，便糊裏糊塗的染上了這惡癖，至今年方三十有餘，已朝夕與此物為伴了六年，真堪　惜。</p>
<p>悔恨交加，乃立志戒除。可是一向習聞：戒除此物，須忍受甚大的痛苦，頗為之躊躇不決。最後始憑著一股勇氣，照著一位中醫所開的方子，配了一料藥，每日照服。起初倒也還好，十來天後，漸覺混身不舒服，漸漸竟痛苦難當，食不下咽，面色驟然大變，臥床不起，不得已重行吸食。失敗過一次，愈覺膽寒。最近，聞人言培補戒煙法具有安全無痛的特點，手續又極簡單，只要購服『生殖素』就是。於是抱著嘗試的態度再來一番，止用了四五十天的光景，就不知不覺地戒絕，絲毫感痛苦，狂喜莫名。（下略）</p>
<p>編者按：煙毒具有高度麻醉性，使身體各組織失去活力；生名之源的生殖腺萎弱不堪，無復能力推進全身各部分之活動。僅於煙毒刺激下，始能暫時亢奮。一旦斷吸，體內活動趨於停頓，乃感痛苦，今服以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，生殖腺健壯，供給各部所需活力，故不致痛苦云。</p>
<p>性的開明</p>

<h3 id="c192">男子的手淫與少女的手淫之害 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>……手淫到若干時期方能顯出弊害則國內之醫學家尚少研究　……凡在女子局部發現異常時殆不妨直謂為都由於手淫而來</p>
<p>通常所謂手淫之害，率多指男性而言，未見得在春情發動時的少女，每亦犯上手淫，且耽溺之程度，反有較男性為甚者。但女性既有所謂自凟行為，那末不論其生理上有何差別，所蒙的弊害，當然不能獨免。</p>
<p>不過她們雖然也蒙到自凟之害，與男性相比，那受害之程度，則較為輕微。</p>
<p>據調查所得，一個剛成年時的男性，如每日手淫一次，則三個月這後，身體各部即起弊害。反之，如屬女性，那至少要繼續六個月之後，方能使月經紊亂。我想，此不過一種觀察，但欲如何肯定，尚待醫學上之證實。</p>
<p>手淫到若乾時期，方能顯出弊害，國內之醫學家尚少研究。但在國外，雖有種種調查，因民族的體格各有不同，所以不能援引作比。不過男性手淫過度之後，在青年時能使局部的發育受阻，神經衰弱症爆發，遺精，夢洩，早洩，陰萎，均為手淫後所能罹患的疾病，這是毫無疑義。</p>
<p>女性手淫過度之後，除月經容易失調之外，厥為局部上的傷害。凡在女子局部發現異常時，殆不妨真謂為由於手淫而來。其最為吾人所習見者，處女膜的破裂，使陰核，和陰唇等，一般地肥大，末梢神經過度地敏感。經騐豐富之婦科醫生，一看到那陰核和陰唇之特別肥大者，便會馬上鑑別出來，她是習慣自凟者</p>
<p>關於最可靠的治療。使手淫所引起的疾病能達到短期消滅之目的。則男性的遺精症，可以『希米脫氏固精片』治之。神經衰弱症及早洩，陰萎與局部的發育受阻者，除利用生死腺素製劑『生殖素』外，則每易失敗，蓋『生殖素』係提取雄性動物的生殖腺內分泌精華所製成，對於種種性病，確具超越的效騐，至於女性之月經不調及子宮障礙，則可服女用『生殖素』以治之。</p>

<h3 id="c193">高聳的乳峯為健美的象徵 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 香港大學醫科學士吳大超</p>
<p>現代女性已放棄了纖纖弱質，重視健康的美。健美包含許多的條件，如肌膚的豐腴結實，身重體高的相稱，態度的活潑，臀部的突出等。但是最主要的一點卻在乳峯美。</p>
<p>乳峯貴高聳而有彈性，在蟬翼似柔薄的衣衫下，隱約地露出中間凹人的一條，兩旁雙峯突起，似欲穿衣而出。走動時微微地一起一伏，更顯得彈性的豐富。異性們不知不覺地被其吸引住，可說是女性美的最動人的一點。不過這種美麗的乳峯，只有健康的人方會具有。那些身體衰弱，先天不足的女子，生殖腺的內分泌不足，以育困難，乳房怎麼能夠發育得如此成熟：</p>
<p>許多乳癟失健的女子戴上了乳罩來自欺欺人，可是衣衫單薄或羅襦初解之時，醜陋的原形立刻會露出來。這是信賴科學的醫藥來補救的好。斯丹那博士發明的女性生殖腺素製劑『女用生殖素』醫治乳癟，最具奇效。能使生死腺發育強壯，連帶地使乳峯發育完美，隆然高聳。於是隨著健康的增進，肌膚豐腴結實，曲線畢露，精神振作，成為非常健美的姑娘。但若在瘦弱時兼患白帶，還要自行外用『療帶靈』為坐藥，方才可以清淨一道，以達根治之目的。</p>

<h3 id="c194">我們應早治的骨節酸痛症 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>要想保持常年無病，必須努力設法使之身體強壯，各部的腺器振作，使新陳代謝的能力促進，然後抵抗力可以增進。與身體衰弱最有關係的疾病，便是骨節痠痛症。原因由於本症的爆發，幾完全為瘋濕的內蘊，及血分的不潔。此外操勞過度，動脈硬化，也能爆發本症。如吾人平日的衛生得當，使身體日漸強壯，則因抵抗力之強，使瘋濕無從侵入，血毒無由積累，工作亦不感覺繁勞，而各部的組織健全，動脈決無硬化之虞。凡此種均為吾人求健康所必需。但欲達到以上的目的，必須強壯的生殖腺，方可產生無限的內分泌。故生殖素製劑『生殖素』實為吾人求康健的最佳藥劑。因其確具上述的功效。如不幸疏於日常的防範，骨節酸痛症一旦爆發，則同時應兼服效能卓絕的『強斯登氏骨痛片』因其配合的藥力，能袪瘋，除濕，清血及預防動脈硬化，服從骨節定可頓感輕鬆。</p>

<h3 id="c195">賽金花死了 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 忻炘</p>
<p>賽金花死了。</p>
<p>賽金花是曾顯赫過一時的，所謂「九城芳譽騰人口，從此爭傳賽二爺。」賽金花是不但以愛嬌來博得大人先生們的歡　，也且是以豪放來使人「爭傳」的。——在三十多年前的封建勢力下，她敢毫無顧忌的打破男女的界限，這大胆就够使縮頭縮腦的入們怔住了。</p>
<p>但也因之她被某些大人先生們看成爲「奇裝異服」招搖過市的國家將亡的妖孽。」</p>
<p>「正派」的大人們把她當作「國家將亡的妖孽」看，理由是再也淺近不過的：大凡一切舊的東西，牠在將形沒落而又沒辦法來補救牠的沒落的時候牠總妒忌，怨恨，因而想破壞一切新的東西，起先所反對破壞的新的東西或許還與舊的有直接的利害衝突，久而久之，因爲覺得新的東西越來越多，越來越堅强，要破壞實在已不勝其破壞，也無法加以破壞了，於是便祗好閉着眼睛，不管其怎樣的亂來一通，也因爲更大的新的勢力已不是他們的能力所能破壞，於是便祗好揀弱小的進攻。新裝的所以被靦爲「奇裝異服」者，她的罪孽實在並不在乎「奇異，」而是因爲是牠「新」的綠故。</p>
<p>所以，「正派」的大人先生們雖把她當爲「國家將亡的妖孽，」民衆們却是對她同情的。對她同情，倒並不在於民衆們比大人先生們的見識高超，知道國家的亡不亡，根本與「奇裝異服」無關，他們也决不會把念頭轉到「奇裝異服」上去；實在是因爲她的大胆她的敢與傳統觀念反抗的行爲使他們怔住了，才直覺地覺得她的可愛。民衆們在幾千年來的重壓下雖是卑怯地不敢稍示反抗，但是對反抗者的崇拜的心理却是有的。</p>
<p>至於有些自命風流的大人先生們的喜歡她呢，却也有些近乎這點。她是個</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>愛嬌的女人，但她却不同於別個祗知愛嬌的女人，別個女人在唯命是從的服從之外，便再沒有別的，她却還有靑春潑刺的精神敢把愛熱鬧的脾氣發揚出來，於是一般自命風流的大人先生們在玩厭了多愁善病的林黛玉式的女人之餘，便因爲她的新奇刺激，來喜愛她了。何况，她還有了「欽差夫人」「狀元夫人」的頭銜，一有頭銜，是古今一例，都當做奇貨看待的。就說現在罷，「皇后」「校花」，不是就比普通的要來得値價嗎？</p>
<p>自然，民衆們對她的不忘是還另有更大的原因的。這原因，抄一句「賽金花」劇本中的台詞，是「在這種國家大變的時候，能够眞眞替百姓們講話的不是什麼大官大府，倒是這麼一個如花如玉的姑娘！」因爲「這麼一個如花如玉的姑娘」倒救了他們的生命，而那些大官大府却倉皇不知所措，民衆們卽使再不濟事些，誰給他們好處，誰給他們壞處却總知道的。雖然在　後賽金花也並沒有得到民衆們多大好處。</p>
<p>賽金花是以偶然的機緣以肉體博取敵人的歡心而能苟延性命於亂世的一個，因爲這偶然的機緣，她能够「賣一點兒小面子，」對百姓們向敵人求求情，更因爲各帝國主義內在的矛盾，她算替西太后盡了一件大臣們所不能盡的「功業」。（請不要忘記，這「功業」是賠欵四萬萬五千萬兩，由天津大沽至北平之路，不得設兵備等十二項辱國條約換來的！）這是不足爲訓的。現在賽金花死了，賽金花的時代是否也隨了賽金花的死而死了呢？——這是頗堪回味一下的。</p>
<h3 id="c196">絨線衫 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 凡甲</p>
<p>弄堂里的孩子們都穿上絨綫衫了，坐在小脚踏車上顯得有些威風。我四歲的一個孩子就偸偸地對媽說，他也要件絨錢衫。當時我不知道妻用什麼話去回答她的小寳貝的。</p>
<p>孩子總喜歡在弄堂里玩，孩子淘里誰有了一伴新的玩具，或誰穿了一件新的衣服，另外的就也要有同樣的玩具與衣服。這或許是我住的弄堂的特色。有一個時候，這弄堂里的孩子每人有一頂飛機帽。有一位朋友來看我，他說這弄堂倒有航空學校的氣概。這也可見孩子們喜歡合羣。</p>
<p>不知什麼時候起，弄堂里又風行小脚踏車了。這玩意兒却不比別的東西好，譬如拍皮球，踢鍵子不過分了兩隊，大家爭勝負，現在是比賽誰的車子跑得快了。這一來，弄堂里常常發生爭吵了。好勝之心長人皆有之的，但是拍皮球，踢鍵子祗是負的一隊要再來，勝的一隊高興地喊幾聲口號，結果還是賓主盡歡的，比賽脚踏車就要闖禍，踏得快果然是可以佔先的，但是手里把不了龍頭還是有碰到墻壁上去的危險，而且一輛車子出了軌，就阻止了另外的一輛，於是，在不堪交友的時候，犬家棄車而戰了。</p>
<p>我的孩子買了飛機帽之後，自然也想有一輛脚踏車，但是我沒有允許他，我拒絕他的理由是這東西要闖禍的，將來買個洋囡囡玩罷。孩子是個好孩子，他不懂得大人的撤謊，他祇是做着一個夢，一個洋囡囡的夢。</p>
<p>自然洋囡囡到現在還沒有買來。他每天見我出門，就輕聲地問我：「爸，今天去買洋囡囡嗎？」我知道他沒有撤野地責問我：「爸，洋囡囡爲什麼還沒有買！」是怕我要打他。見到他那樣的可憐相，做爸爸的倒底不是一條忍心的蛇，我點點頭，答應他今天晚上一定買來。但是回家的時候，只拿幾顆糖，或一包糖炒栗子哄他再做一天好夢。</p>
<p>這一次要做絨錢衫，他不問我要了，他問他的媽媽。孩子又是個聰明的孩子，他已經看透了做爸爸的不是個好人，脚踏車旣認爲要闖禍，難道也怕洋囡囡要謀財害命嗎？然而媽媽除了比爸爸能够抱着他講一個什麼故事之外，其餘像爸爸一樣專會撤謊，而几撤謊的手段又比爸爸高明。</p>
<p>我出門的時候，孩子又在弄堂里，他站在太陽那邊的墻脚，羨慕地看到他的同伴穿着絨綫衫在比賽脚踏車。他兩伴東西一伴都沒有，孩子們的英武更襯出了他像鬥敗的公鷄悄悄地被他們踢出圈子了。見我出來他跑過來牽着我的衣服跟我走了一段落？在弄堂門口才要我買包糖炒栗子回來。</p>
<p>我哄他回家去，爸爸會買好東西回來的，懷着這個心願我走過許多百貨商店，都在實行冬季大减價了，但是找不出一件我心里所要買的絨綫衫。歸家的路上，我在糖炒栗子邊的水菓店里多買了一個生梨。</p>
<p>這兩樣好東西，孩子很快樂地接受了。吃的時候，依在媽胸前自說自話的：「爸明天會買絨錢衫回來的。」</p>
<p>我對他望了一眼，妻也對他望了一眼。</p>
<p>這晚上我看了幾頁書，忽然想起箱底里還有伴我的舊錢衫，拆下來改織一件孩子的還綽乎有餘，吿訴了我妻，妻也同意了，不過她說我自已買件新的吧。</p>
<p>第二天絨棧拆來洗過了，穿了竹竿曬在太陽里，孩子就跳來跳去用骯髒的手去摸着，因爲妻吿訴他絨綫曬乾了就好替他結絨錢衫了。</p>
<p>二夫功夫，絨綫衫穿在孩子身上了。我推開窗，想看看他依舊參加到那個集團里去的欣喜，孩子應該讓他們在孩子的世界里週旋的。但是他站在太陽那邊的墻脚邊，他還缺少一輛小脚踏車呢！</p>
<p>妻也凑過頭來的時候，我把窗關上了。</p>
<h3 id="c197">籠子裏的人們 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 三三</p>
<p>—貴州的囚徒</p>
<p>早上，當含羞的太陽把它的光芒吝惜地射着鐵窗的時候，許多雙眼睛就會睜開來，從「籠槓」隙里，從鐵窗格中，親切地去探望那小塊的天日。</p>
<p>這又是一天的開始了。</p>
<p>照例的，管獄員的下手（我們呌他「提鑰匙的」。）在這時就會來開門，放一個「看差」出去喊水來；這一段期間，「中籠」的「老爺」們，又有在外面草塲散步的機會了。</p>
<p>憑着他們（老爺們）有錢——拿幾十元給管獄員，幾元給「提鑰匙的」，再拿一兩元分給幾個「看差」，就可以到「中籠」里居住了。</p>
<p>「中籠」之所以與「內籠」不同，第一是因爲這地方比較寬，離窗比較近。其次，在中籠才能睡高床。第三，管獄員另眼看待，可以把親友放到籠里來同他們會談，而且第四，他們有更長的「放封」時間。</p>
<p>在「內籠」的人呢？他們每七八個裝在一個籠子里；這籠子只有二方丈左右，四面都是小碗粗的木槓（我們呌它「籠槓」。）圍着，只在槓縫里隠約地看得見幾絲天，就是晴天，這里面還是陰風慘慘」，加上那些黑瘦的面龐，恐怕眞同地獄差不了許多。地是泥地，永遠是那樣潮濕，而人們却只用一床草蓆或幾根稻草墊着睡覺。在籠角，不新的放散着臭氣的比水桶還高還大的糞桶，永遠陪伴着他們。</p>
<p>熱天，從「籠槓」縫里，一串一串的臭蟲，川流不息地爬上人身，爬上菜蔬，爬進飯里；而且，他們不是「晝伏夜出」的，無論甚麼時候，你若不化大部的時間去同它們搏鬥，你就得不到暫時的安寗；一個人，每天捉上一百個臭蟲</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>是一樁輕而易舉的事。</p>
<p>冷天，蝨子就代替了臭蟲，進攻他們。</p>
<p>籠子里的人們，除掉了很窮的，伙食都是自給，或由家里送來，或託看差把米菜買來自己燒。</p>
<p>窮光蛋們，每天在獄里領到兩筒或三筒不漲飯的紅糙米。（約合二小碗）煮乾飯只能得三四碗，當然不能滿足他們兩餐的需要，但他們却不能不用一些去換水，換媒和蔬菜，所剩下的，除了煮粥吃，沒有第二樣辦法了，經年的，他們就在淸粥中苟延着生命。</p>
<p>每一個新進來的，都關在內籠里，若果他的出身好些’管獄員就要把他常成「肥猪」，這位「肥猪」若果不識相，打，上鐐，就會加在他的身上，而且還會禁止他家里人送飯給他吃，非到拿出錢來不罷休。只拿得出五元的，就仍舊坐在內籠里，所得到的祗是停止虐待；能出十元以上的，就可以移到中籠來了。</p>
<p>而每一個新犯人，還要受「籠頭」，（資格最老，又有威力的人）的挾制，你還得給點錢給他，不然，他會折磨你，會要你睡馬桶邊，會要你每天都擔當倒糞桶的責任。</p>
<p>管獄員，「提鑰匙的」可以打罵犯人，這不用說，就是那些關在籠子里管犯人的看差，（他們住中籠）你若果不給他一點好處，他也會呵斥你，不給你到外面去買東西。</p>
<p>每天，在兩點鐘到四點鐘這段期間，是犯人們見天日的時候了，提鑰匙的會把他們放到外面空地上來。</p>
<p>這段「放封時間，雖然是衙門里規定的，但遇着提鑰匙的不高興，幾天不放封也無可奈何他。糞桶滿出來他是不管的。</p>
<p>在黑暗中，在潮濕的地上，在汚穢的空氣里和臭蟲蝨子的攻擊底下，吃不飽的人們，經常的生着病，衰弱，衰弱……到他們每天所祈禱的日子（出獄到來時，他們已像關久的鳥，困難展翅了。</p>

<p>Bandit Troops Are Intimidated Internally and Mostly Think of Reversing Allegiance</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain escaped bandit from Wang Ying's troops who came to Beiping, the National Army's bullets never miss, and many of the bandit army's armored vehicles have been destroyed. The bandit army's flag emblem is the Eight Trigrams, and the uniforms are green. Soldiers are paid 11 yuan per month, and officers are paid at least 70 yuan, but only a quarter of the salary is paid. Morale is not firm, and they often think of reversing their allegiance. There are also many drug addicts. Every time they come into contact with the enemy, they are too timid to move forward. A certain source supervises the battle from behind, so they dare to go forward. Once they collapse, they are machine-gunned to death by a certain source. In the battle to seize the temple, many bandits died under the National Army's machine guns. According to people from Suiyuan, the bandit planes dare not fly low over the eastern front of Suiyuan because the National Army's anti-aircraft guns are accurate. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The heads of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries held a joint meeting at the Navy Minister's residence yesterday. It is reported that they decided to liquidate the past passive attitude toward China and adopt a proactive policy in the future. That is, regardless of where in China, whenever there is a risk to the lives and property of Japanese nationals, the army or navy will be dispatched immediately to implement vigilance measures. The above decision is generally considered extremely important, and it is believed that Japan's actions in Qingdao are an example of this. (6th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese newspapers, as a result of yesterday afternoon's meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, the Army, and the Navy, it was decided that Japan should implement a strong policy towards China in order to effectively protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. Therefore, all newspapers predict that Japanese people living in the interior of China will withdraw to various locations where they can obtain the protection of the Japanese army in times of crisis. When the above situation occurs and Japanese interests are in danger, powerful actions will be taken. The opinions of observers here believe that the Japanese troops stationed in North China will henceforth assume the responsibility of protecting their nationals, similar to the actions taken by the Japanese Navy in the Yangtze River basin and various seaports in South China.

<p>(Qingdao) Although the 6th was a Sunday, Mayor Shen and the important officials of the city government still worked as usual. There were eight Japanese warships docked in the front sea and two in the back sea. The gate of the city government faced the Japanese warships from a distance, but our officials and civilians acted as if they did not see them. Their calm and determined attitude can be known. The reporter inspected the various roads at 1 p.m. and saw citizens walking to and fro, chatting and laughing freely. They were not afraid of the Japanese soldiers patrolling, as patriotism is enough to deal with the crisis. Before 3 p.m., the Japanese warships unloaded a large amount of luggage, piled up like a mountain. Although the situation in the city seems to have eased on the surface today, the deployment of Japanese troops in the Sifang and Cangku areas is becoming more serious. Our authorities have already made arrangements to deal with the crisis. (6th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The local newspapers here today received a dispatch from Qingdao, stating that the Japanese authorities in Qingdao have made demands on Mayor Shen Honglie regarding the strike by workers at the cotton mill. (6th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Discusses the Process of Sino-Japanese Negotiations; Adjustment of Diplomatic Relations Must Be Genuine and Thorough; Eagerly Awaiting the Elimination of Obstacles <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the negotiations on the adjustment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a statement that the Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its desire to adjust Sino-Japanese relations and deeply believes that for the sake of maintaining peace in East Asia, China and Japan must base their relations on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and integrity in order to achieve a genuine adjustment. This principle is an indispensable element for maintaining modern international relations. Without this principle, there is no way to establish credibility and no way to seek peace. China believes that the so-called sincerity between countries should be judged by whether or not they recognize this unchanging principle. Japan has also repeatedly stated the need to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, and the Chinese government believes that Japan must also sympathize with the above-mentioned principles and be prepared to fully apply them to Sino-Japanese relations. After Minister Zhang Qun took office, he held several talks with Mr. Arita, the current Japanese Foreign Minister and former Ambassador to China, in March of this year, earnestly explaining the need to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, and that the most legitimate way to do so should start with the Northeast issue, so that China's territorial integrity could be restored. At that time, Ambassador Arita believed that the time was not right to resolve the Northeast issue, so Minister Zhang advocated that the first step, at the very least, should be to find a way to eliminate the state of affairs that hinders the administrative integrity of Hebei, Chahar, and Inner Mongolia. Although it was discussed repeatedly, it was ultimately ineffective because the Japanese side was not prepared for a thorough adjustment. In recent years, the emotions of the Chinese people have become increasingly agitated due to various facts, but the Chinese government, in order to maintain peace between the two countries and to hope for a legitimate diplomatic solution, has made every effort to admonish and crack down, and fortunately, the people have understood and lived in peace. Unexpectedly, the Chengdu incident suddenly occurred in August. The Chinese government authorities immediately expressed their willingness to resolve it in accordance with international practice. The Japanese side, at the beginning of the negotiations, raised some questions, requesting a prior decision. Some of them were very important in nature. China is certainly willing to proceed with the adjustment of diplomatic relations at any time, but it does not want to be adjusted in name only, without achieving the reality of adjustment, and fears that it will cause disputes and increase difficulties. The Chinese authorities have repeatedly explained to the Japanese side that the government, of course, regrets the unfortunate incidents involving Japanese residents in various places, but since the September 18th Incident, there have been countless incidents that have caused unease and resentment among the Chinese people. In this situation, the Chinese government has still done its best to promote good relations between the two countries, admonish the people, and implement appropriate crackdowns, and has achieved considerable results, as mentioned above. However, for the sake of getting to the root of the problem, it is firmly believed that both China and Japan must work hard to restore the people's feelings to normalcy, and the way to restore them is to first eliminate the causes of ill will; otherwise, even rational people will not be able to repair good neighborly relations, and there may be people who take advantage of the opportunity to pursue their own interests. The Chinese government's views have not changed to this day. Since the Japanese side has raised some questions requiring resolution, our diplomatic authorities have always discussed them with sincerity and frankness, and explained China's position on each issue, with China's position always based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and integrity. At the same time, based on the same principles, our side has also raised some matters within the smallest and most possible scope, requesting a reasonable solution, but the Japanese side's views have not been entirely the same. Negotiations between the two sides have lasted for more than two months, and opinions on several points of each issue have become relatively close. Unfortunately, the Suiyuan incident, which Minister Zhang repeatedly urged the Japanese government to seriously pay attention to and crack down on in his talks, occurred, obstructing the progress of diplomacy. It is a pity that the various issues under discussion have not been concluded as of today. When Minister Zhang met with Ambassador Kawagoe on the 3rd of this month, Minister Zhang first lodged a protest with Ambassador Kawagoe regarding the landing and search of Japanese soldiers in Qingdao and described the facts of the investigation of the Suiyuan incident, requesting the Japanese government to quickly stop the involvement of Japanese military personnel and civilians in the instigation. Ambassador Kawagoe mentioned the matters under negotiation and recited a prepared memorandum. Minister Zhang then stated that the negotiated matters would be discussed another day, so there was no discussion that evening. As for Ambassador Kawagoe's memorandum, it described the past discussions but was not an accurate record. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a letter to the Japanese Embassy to clarify this. This is a rough account of the circumstances from mid-September onwards, starting with the Chengdu incident and the negotiations between Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe. What we earnestly hope is that the current state of affairs obstructing the progress of diplomacy will be eliminated as soon as possible. It is firmly believed that all issues can be reasonably resolved through legitimate channels in an atmosphere where China does not feel threatened. Minister Zhang also greatly admires Ambassador Kawagoe's spirit of sincere effort for the good of relations between the two countries, and hopes that in the shortest possible time, Ambassador Kawagoe's efforts will be able to eliminate the obstacles and proceed smoothly. (6th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-Japanese adjustment negotiations seem to have stalled due to the Suiyuan situation and the Japanese soldiers' landing incident in Qingdao. Ambassador Kawagoe is said to be returning to Japan after going to Shanghai, but the date of his departure must await instructions from the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Suma and Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had a meeting on the 5th and will continue to meet tomorrow. The Japanese side is currently planning to gradually resolve minor issues such as the Chengdu and Beihai cases, and then conduct appropriate negotiations on general issues. Shimizu will return to Nanjing in a day or two to assist Suma. The embassy staff transferred from Shanghai to Nanjing are still all in Nanjing. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e10">The Ambassador's Memorandum Which Was Left Behind Is Inaccurate; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Declares That It Cannot Be Used as Reference <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Japanese ambassador Kawagoe's leaving a memorandum at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during his meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang on the evening of the 3rd of this month, newspapers have reported a lot. The reporter has now obtained details from relevant parties. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, at 7:30 p.m., Foreign Minister Zhang specifically asked Ambassador Kawagoe to come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the landing and arrest of Japanese soldiers in Qingdao, and lodged a protest. Ambassador Kawagoe agreed to report to his government. Later, he mentioned the matter of Sino-Japanese negotiations and read aloud a pre-prepared memorandum, recounting the past discussions between the two sides, and left the memorandum behind. Foreign Minister Zhang pointed out that the various sections of the memorandum describing the past talks contained entries that were not said by either side, and entries that were said but were not included. He cited several points as examples and questioned Ambassador Kawagoe. Ambassador Kawagoe still hoped to leave it as a reference. Foreign Minister Zhang believed that the memorandum was not an accurate record and could not be accepted, and sent it back to the Japanese Embassy that night. The next day, the Japanese Embassy sent the original document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the document only recorded what Ambassador Kawagoe said and was only for memory reference. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then sent a formal letter to the Japanese Embassy stating that since the document was not an accurate record of past conversations, it could not be used as a reference. This is the account of the incident. (6th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Asahi Shimbun's special correspondent met with Ambassador Kawagoe on the Beijing-Shanghai train on the 5th. According to reports, Kawagoe stated that the Japanese memorandum was handed over to Foreign Minister Zhang on the evening of the 3rd and that Japan had withdrawn it, but it is still in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The memorandum only mentioned that Japan asked China to take the fastest possible way to realize the points that China had already agreed to, and did not mention the anti-communist issue. The central powerful figures of the National Government have a strong sense of national consciousness, and I hope that they will carefully consider the future of Sino-Japanese relations. I also hope that the Nanjing government has the sincerity to carry out adjustments to diplomatic relations. The current situation is extremely pessimistic, and the talk of a breakdown is rampant, but I still think that it has not reached the point of despair, and I believe that China will continue to sincerely discuss with Japan. Furthermore, Ambassador Kawagoe denied in a telephone conversation with the reporters of the Jiji Shimbun on the 5th that the Sino-Japanese talks had broken down, but admitted that the handling of the current problems is extremely difficult. The Jiji reporters asked what attitude would be taken towards China after the stagnation of the Nanjing talks, whether the strong opinions before the Manchurian Incident would be adopted, or whether there would be a return to the Shidehara diplomacy, and which of the two would be the better policy. Kawagoe replied that the government would have to decide. Kawagoe also said that he did not want to return home or retire at this time, and would go to Nanjing again if necessary. Finally, Kawagoe said that he was not considering increasing or decreasing the number of marines stationed in China. (6th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e21">China's Attitude Toward Five Issues in Sino-Japanese Negotiations: Revision of Import Tariffs is a Matter of China's Internal Affairs; Suppression of Anti-Japanese Sentiment Should First Eliminate the Causes of Its Occurrence <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The news released by the Allied News Agency a few days ago stated that among the various issues in Sino-Japanese negotiations, five items have been agreed upon in principle by both parties. These five items are aviation links, revision of import tariffs, suppression of illegal activities by Koreans, hiring of Japanese advisors, and suppression of anti-Japanese sentiment. The reporter has learned from reliable sources that China's attitude toward the five issues is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Sino-Japanese aviation issue refers to the issue of civil aviation links between Shanghai and Fukuoka. The Japanese side proposed this matter before the September 18th Incident. Last year, the Ministry of Communications of China and the Ministry of Communications of Japan also discussed it several times in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit and drafted a plan. However, since last winter, Japanese aircraft have been flying freely in various parts of northern China without legal procedures, greatly affecting China's sovereignty over its airspace. The Chinese government believes that it is very difficult to proceed with the Shanghai-Fukuoka air link before this situation ends. The government's attitude has not changed so far.</p>
<p>(2) The revision of China's import tariffs is a matter of China's internal affairs. The tariffs set by the government can be adjusted appropriately at any time, taking into account the country's financial situation and commercial conditions. However, when the Chinese government studies the adjustment of tariffs, it will naturally consider the cessation of smuggling and the freedom of customs anti-smuggling as the first things to be considered.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the suppression of illegal activities by Koreans, the Chinese government certainly does not want any foreigners to engage in any illegal activities in its territory. However, at the same time, Koreans, Taiwanese, and other Japanese nationals who engage in illegal activities under the protection of Japanese forces should also be suppressed by the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the hiring of Japanese advisors, the Chinese government independently hires foreign advisors based on the government's needs and the skills of the hired person, without any distinction of nationality. If Sino-Japanese relations have indeed improved, it is not impossible for China to independently hire Japanese technical personnel as experts. However, this is not something that can be demanded by a foreign government.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the suppression of so-called anti-Japanese sentiment, the Chinese government has repeatedly admonished the people to maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries, and local officials have also earnestly implemented this policy. If the people have any behavior that exceeds the scope in the future, the Chinese government will continue to suppress it according to law. However, the occurrence of popular resentment must have its reasons. If the Japanese side can change its policy towards China and truly work hand in hand with China, then all so-called anti-Japanese actions can be completely eliminated, and a sincere friendship can be permanently maintained between the people of the two countries.

<p>(Nanjing) According to sources concerned, a Chinese expatriate named Zeng Yuxiang, who lives in Jombang, East Java, has recently invented a chemical coffee tea.

<p>A person from Beiping said that gambling has recently become rampant in Beiping. Japanese and Korean rōnin, who have reached the end of their rope from selling opium, are making small loans. However, due to excessive interest rates and strict deadlines, it is difficult to develop their businesses. Therefore, many of them have changed careers and opened gambling dens, such as the Zhensheng Hotel on Xiheyan, the Huabei Hotel in Dali Shaomao Hutong, the Riguang Amusement Park on Qianmen Street, the Letian Amusement Park in Hanjiatan, the Taiyang Amusement Park on Wang Guangfu Diagonal Street, the Datong Amusement Park in Wanfosi Bay, the Hezhong Amusement Park in Guanyinsi, and the Kaiming Theater in Xiliushulin, etc., are all places for gambling. Most of the gamblers are prostitutes and low-class people. There are countless people who have fallen into this art. The gambling time is from noon to 12:00 midnight. Although the authorities have repeatedly negotiated to prohibit it, it has been fruitless due to the lack of sincere assistance from a certain party. Under this kind of situation, murders can happen at any time. At about 3:00 p.m. on the 3rd, Zhang Quan, a gambler by profession, who was 67 years old, also known as Xiaoquan and nicknamed Thirteen Flags, went to the Riguang Amusement Park to collect debts. He first had an argument with a clerk named Song Lao. Then Zhang injured his head with a teacup in an attempt to extort money. A Korean named Lin Shangqiao, who was working at the amusement park, thought that Zhang was intentionally disturbing the gambling den and stabbed Zhang in the head with a bayonet and threw him on the road on Qianmen Street. At this time, the gamblers in the amusement park were extremely dissatisfied with the situation and rushed out together and smashed the glass windows of the amusement park with bricks and stones. The storm escalated. Police officers from the Outer Fifth District heard the news and rushed to maintain order and reported to the Public Security Bureau, which informed the Japanese Police Department to send officer Sakata to the scene to jointly handle the negotiations. This incident alone shows the ferocity of the Koreans in Beiping. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 4th, another person, relying on the power of a certain party, rode a bicycle without buying a donation plate and went to the entrance of Dongjiaominxiang. He was discovered by the police and gendarmes on duty and an argument broke out. A soldier from a certain country came out to help him and took the gendarme away. The police officer asked why he was arresting the gendarme, but the police officer was also taken away. After the authorities negotiated with a certain party, he was released that night.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Rice Prices Soar in Southern Fujian <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>A Large Amount Has Been Shipped to Shantou Again in the Past Week</p>
<p>Xiamen Rice Industry Asks to Temporarily Withdraw the Tax on Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Although the late rice harvest in Fujian Province this year was originally abundant, rice prices in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Zhangzhou have risen day by day. The reason is that rice produced in eastern Fujian and Zhangzhou is transported out. The public outlet is Shantou, and the secret outlet is Taiwan. Rice in Zhangzhou rose by 20-30 cents in the middle of last month due to the transportation to Shantou. Later, the price in Shantou fell temporarily, and the price also returned to normal. At the end of the month, a rice merchant in Zhangzhou was entrusted to secretly purchase 8,000 piculs to be transported to Taiwan, and the price suddenly rose by 50 cents. At the beginning of this month, the price of rice in Shantou rose to 9 yuan again. Starting from the 1st of this month, rice stored in Xiamen has been continuously shipped to Shantou. White Zhan rice has risen from 6.7 yuan to 6.9 yuan, and coarse Zhan has risen from 6.2 yuan to 6.45 yuan. According to rice merchants, Shantou is implementing a full tax on foreign rice, and rice merchants are competing to purchase domestic rice. In addition to purchasing from Shanghai and Wuhu, they are also purchasing from Zhangzhou. At present, the price of rice in Shanghai and Wuhu is rising, and it is unprofitable to transport it to Shantou, so they are all turning to Zhangzhou. In recent days, rice merchants in Shantou have purchased more than 1,000 bags in Shima. At the same time, various counties along the coast of Zhangzhou, such as Pinghe, Zhao'an, Yunxiao, Zhangpu, and Nanjing, mostly use sailing ships to transport it directly for export. Longxi, Tianbao, Jiangdong Bridge, and Changtai transport it to Shima for transshipment for export. Each picul can make a profit of about one yuan. Although the price of grain and rice in Shima has risen, very few people from other villages come to the wharf to sell grain, so the rice mills have no grain to grind and the rice stocks are empty. On the other hand, the counties of Yongchun in Quanzhou have also increased the export of rice and grain and prohibited the export. At present, this chaotic phenomenon has caused unease among the people in southern Fujian. In Fuzhou, the price of rice has risen by 40 cents in the past week, reaching 9.6 yuan, with the momentum to break through the 10 yuan mark. However, most of the rice exported does not pass through customs and is smuggled, so there is no exact number to verify. Except for the publicly transported to Shantou, which has a verifiable quantity, the rest is unknown. In the midst of this rice panic, the Xiamen Rice Industry Association and the Hong Kong Industry Association responded to the Guangdong Provincial Government and submitted a petition to the Chamber of Commerce on the 5th requesting to telegraph the Executive Yuan to temporarily withdraw the foreign rice tax. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"We have found that the price of rice and grain in the market has recently soared due to the urgent need for rice in Guangdong Province and the absorption of rice from Shantou, resulting in a shortage of food in southern Fujian and high prices. If we do not seek relief urgently, the people's food will be worrisome. Fujian is not a rice-producing area. Even in times of good harvest, it still needs a large amount of foreign rice to supply. Since the customs levied a full tax on foreign rice, this foreign rice has disappeared. Food from all parts of the country is also very expensive, so there is no emergency relief. I am afraid that the grain will be expensive and hurt the people in the future. The foreign rice tax was originally to prevent dumping, and it should be adjusted according to the domestic food situation. Now that there is a food shortage, it seems appropriate to temporarily abolish it and restore it after the spring grain is abundant. Therefore, we hereby petition your association to telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to approve the temporary withdrawal of the foreign rice tax, and the people of Fujian will be deeply grateful."

<h3 id="e47">Legislative Principles of Inheritance Tax <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The Central Political Committee recently passed ten inheritance tax principles and sent them to the Legislative Yuan for review. It is expected that the legislative process can be completed soon, and this new tax may be levied next spring. We have said before that inheritance tax is a good tax in the modern tax system, but in the process of this legislation, we cannot help but worry about whether this new tax, which is being created, can be implemented successfully in the future. We believe that the legislative authorities cannot simply seek convenience in the collection method, otherwise, there will definitely be many obstacles after implementation. We would like to put forward two points based on what we have seen.</p>
<p>First, inheritance tax has two types of systems: gross inheritance tax and separate inheritance tax. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of the former is that the tax rate is simple, the investigation and collection procedures are simple, and the financial income is also higher. The disadvantage is that it does not ask about the number of heirs and the closeness of the relationship between the heir and the deceased and collects the same amount of tax for the same amount of gross inheritance, which is not very consistent with the principle of taxability and the principle of fair burden. The latter determines the tax rate based on the closeness of the relationship between the heir and the deceased and the number of heirs. It is very fair and consistent with the principle of taxability. The disadvantage is that the investigation and collection procedures are more complicated, and the financial income is also less. How should we choose between the two? Although the legislation of various countries is different, not many have adopted the former, and the general trend is to adopt a mixture of the two systems. Our country's inheritance tax should, of course, consider the beneficial aspects of the national treasury revenue, but it must also strive to comply with the principle of taxability and the principle of fairness. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the strengths of both of the above-mentioned collection systems.</p>
<p>Second, although there is a theory in legal studies that newly enacted laws can be implemented in phases and regions within the national territory, it is very harmful to adopt this theory in the inheritance tax law. Because if the inheritance tax law is implemented in phases and regions, the nationals under the same government will have different tax obligations to the state at the same time. This not only violates the principle of fair tax burden, but also makes it inevitable that the inheritors of the inheritance within the inheritance tax collection area will move to the area where inheritance tax has not yet been collected in order to evade tax obligations. This will also add a layer of difficulty to the execution of the household registration law and the conscription law. The provisional regulations on inheritance tax drafted by the Ministry of Finance this spring have the provision that "the date and area of implementation of these regulations shall be determined by order." If this contains the meaning of phased implementation, it should be revised.</p>
<p>We hope that the legislative authorities will pay attention to the above two points when creating the inheritance tax law. In addition, the government must also make several necessary efforts to promote the inheritance tax. For example, the household registration law should be strictly enforced, and the protection of the right to a name in the current Civil Code should be restricted so that people cannot use their inherent habits to use nicknames to break up their property to evade tax obligations. The government should also make considerable efforts internationally so that people do not take refuge in international forces to evade tax obligations. However, these are not matters within the scope of legislation.</p>

<p>(Rome) Pope Pius XI's condition is currently quite serious. It is reported that he is suffering from shortness of breath, with a slight fever, and there is concern that it may lead to influenza.  The Pope's heart is quite weak, so his condition is considered worrying. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Vatican City. Today, Vatican officials admitted that should Pope Pius's health deteriorate further, or if he should pass away, the International Eucharistic Congress scheduled to be held in Manila from February 3rd to 7th next year may be postponed.  Currently, the Pope is unable to walk due to a problem with his right leg, and there are concerns that he may not be able to move again in the future, causing deep concern among Vatican officials.  Furthermore, the Pope is greatly worried about the perilous situation of Catholics in Spain, which has further aggravated his condition. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Vatican City.  Pope Pius XI has been bedridden for many days due to the worsening of his foot ailment. He slept well last night, and his condition has not changed, seemingly showing slight improvement.  His physician, Dr. Milani, after examining him this morning at 8:00 AM, immediately and firmly instructed the Pope not to get out of bed and not to go to the church to celebrate Mass. The Pope then received Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State of the Vatican, in his bedroom for a meeting that lasted 45 minutes, and comforted his attendants, telling them not to panic.  Although those around the Pope do not appear worried, they are deeply concerned about other complications due to the Pope's advanced age. The Pope's bedroom is quite small, painted entirely white, and simply furnished, with only a brass bed, a desk, and a prayer stand. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Washington) United States Secretary of State Hull recently delivered a speech at the Pan-American Peace Conference, stating, "Although the United States government politically refuses to accept any form of binding obligation, it should still cooperate with all nations, as many as possible, to work together for peace.  It is concerned with matters such as reducing or limiting armaments and monitoring the arms trade." It is generally believed that Secretary of State Hull's statement echoes the speech given by French Foreign Minister Delbos on the 4th. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Madrid. Thirty Nationalist aircraft bombed Madrid and its suburbs today, causing many civilian casualties.  The final six large bombers dropped numerous bombs in the Model Prison area, as the Nationalist forces' four attempts to capture the city have been unsuccessful, and this area is the biggest obstacle. According to an official announcement, the bombing resulted in 92 deaths and 200 injuries. However, it is claimed that today government forces, using 40 artillery pieces and many machine guns, attacked the rear guard of the Nationalist forces in the university district, killing over a thousand people. British expatriates here have received warnings that they must leave the city of Madrid by Thursday of next week at the latest. The British Embassy convened an emergency meeting of 50 British expatriates at the embassy and urged them to board British warships immediately, as the embassy may close its doors within a few days.

The Nationalist forces used artillery to attack the government forces' positions in Villareal, which was countered by the government forces' artillery, and they were immediately repelled. The Nationalist forces also attacked the government forces' positions in Udala, suffering heavy losses and retreating. The Nationalist forces are now entrenched in Vitoria, and civilians have been evacuated from the city.

<h3 id="e54">The French National Assembly Expresses Confidence in the Blum Cabinet; Dissatisfaction with the Policy of Blocking Spain; Communist Assembly Members Abstain from Voting; Cracks Exposed in the People's Front <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Today was the second day of the National Assembly's debate on the government's foreign policy. As a result of the debate, Premier Blum proposed a vote of confidence on the government's foreign policy. The National Assembly voted on it, and it passed by a large majority of 350 votes to 171. Eighty-one Communist assembly members abstained from voting. It should be noted that today was the first time since the establishment of the People's Front government that a vote of confidence was proposed to the National Assembly, and it was also the first time that the Communist Party was unwilling to vote in favor of the People's Front government. The reason for this is the Blum Cabinet's decision to continue implementing the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Before the National Assembly voted on the motion of confidence in the government, Premier Blum delivered a speech, which, although brief, was quite poignant. He first stated that France's foreign policy is based on two simple principles: France's own interests should transcend everything, and that France's peace and European peace cannot be separated. The Premier said, "All assembly members and the entire French people must agree to these two principles, because war and peace cannot be confined within the borders of one country. If we want to preserve our country from war, we must also try to prevent war from breaking out in other countries. This is something everyone should understand." The Premier continued, "Spain has only one legitimate government. If the Nationalist forces authorities were to achieve military victory, it would not only harm democracy, but also threaten peace. It is regrettable that several national governments do not understand this and cannot abide by the non-intervention agreement. However, it is not necessarily the case that the principle of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War can be abandoned for this reason. If we want to find a way to help the Spanish Republican government win, merely restoring trade relations with Spain may not be enough. It is necessary for the government to send troops and supply arms to assist the Spanish government in order to achieve practical results. But why has the Communist Party not proposed this method? It is because the party is also well aware of the danger of this method. In short, my beliefs remain the same as before, that the danger of a European war is imminent, and that it can only be saved by France's actions. So what are you criticizing the government for? Do you think the government is too afraid of war? Do you think the government has put too much effort into peace? If so, then the government is not afraid of this kind of criticism, because one day, if the situation requires it, I will say to the world with a firm attitude, 'We, France, are not afraid of war!' But when will the French government make this kind of statement? It will be when our country's territory is threatened, and it will be when the territory of a country whose maintenance we have signed to acknowledge is threatened." (At this point, the entire room applauded.) (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) When the National Assembly voted on the motion of confidence in the government today, the Communist assembly members abstained from voting. Therefore, there seems to be a sign of division within the People's Front. In the evening, after the National Assembly adjourned, Premier Blum gave a speech to the press, stating that although Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Communist Assembly Member Duclos, gave a fierce speech, the cabinet has decided to continue to hold power and will not resign because of this. Blum added, "We have decided to continue to govern because we are aware of the seriousness of the current environment. If a cabinet upheaval were to occur, foreigners would not be able to understand France's attitude, and domestic public opinion would also be confused and at a loss. Our national strength would inevitably be weakened, and various social reforms would inevitably be halted. Therefore, the government will not do this. However, all future actions of the People's Front government must be supported by the parties participating in the People's Front with a spirit of fidelity and trust." Furthermore, the joint meeting of the representatives of the left-wing parties of the National Assembly will be held next Tuesday to discuss the issue of whether the Communist Party will continue to support the current government. At that time, if the Communist Party reiterates its cooperation with the Blum Cabinet, the political situation should be greatly clarified. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Churchill Publishes an Article Warning the British Cabinet to Proceed with Caution; To Follow the Procedures of Consulting with Parliament; Not to Coerce the King to Abdicate <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prominent Conservative Member of Parliament Winston Churchill published an article today urging the public to remain calm, stating that the nation should understand the nature of the constitutional dispute. There is currently no conflict between the King and Parliament, and this matter has not yet been discussed with Parliament. The current issue is whether the King will abdicate on the advice of the cabinet members. It has never happened before that such advice has been given to the King. What we are encountering is the King's desire to do something that cannot succeed in any way, and has been doing so for five months. This act may never succeed for various reasons. Demanding the supreme sacrifice of abdication and potential exile has no constitutional basis. The cabinet has no authority to advise the King to abdicate. Only the most serious parliamentary procedures can raise this point in a firm manner. The cabinet has no right to act on its own without first exploring the wishes of Parliament. Churchill meant that this could be done by the King issuing an edict to Parliament, or by both Houses of Parliament submitting a memorial to the King. Conservative Member of Parliament Cripps also published an article today, agreeing with the government's attitude expressed by the Prime Minister, but stated that the advice to the King should be based on the national political interests, and not on the opinions of one individual or sect. He also said, "I believe that there is no sufficient reason to force the King to abdicate now, and I believe that the nation will never want to go to this extreme." (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Churchill also said that if the cabinet had obtained a guarantee from the leaders of the opposition parties in advance, that even if the cabinet resigned, the opposition parties would never come out and form a cabinet, it would be tantamount to presenting the King with an ultimatum. We should take a patient attitude now and not act rashly, because the act of demanding the King's abdication is extremely serious. Not only should Parliament constitutionally reaffirm its position in advance, but all methods that can achieve a more satisfactory solution should also be tried. In addition, there is still a question: What has been done so far? It is heard that the King has proposed that the cabinet submit a bill to Parliament (referring to the King's spouse not being able to set an example for the nation, and her children not being able to inherit the throne). As far as this matter is concerned, the cabinet can refuse to submit such a bill if it does not intend to, so why is it necessary to demand the King's abdication? (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the marriage issue, after an address made by Churchill, a well-known Conservative Party Member of Parliament, the general public is wondering if the Cabinet members are to remain tranquil and prudent as a result of this address. Political insiders note that the address by Churchill would, without a doubt, leave an impression with the populace, though it is difficult to determine how it would affect the other Members of Parliament. What is clear is that the right-wing Conservative Party under the leadership of Churchill has always opposed Prime Minister Baldwin, and is likely to respond accordingly. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">International Attention <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(London) International attention remains focused on the dispute between the British King and the Cabinet over the marriage issue, with the United States paying particular attention. Only the German newspapers have not published a single word on the matter. Washington officials believe that the British King is one of the few balancing forces in this turbulent world, and that any change would have repercussions. Therefore, they hope that Britain can overcome all crises without harming the King's authority. This hope reflects the general sentiment in the United States. The French press's tone on the matter is mostly sympathetic to both the King and Britain. The Paris newspapers all believe that the King's abdication is the only solution. Italy is paying close attention to the matter and expresses great sympathy for the difficulties experienced by the King, Parliament, and the British Empire. The Soviet newspapers only publish the events and news about Mrs. Simpson, without any commentary. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(London) Concerning the issues surrounding the King and his desire to marry Wallis Simpson, there has been a great upsurge in support for the King by the populace and the press in recent days. Labour MP Jack Khut began to spread word of a pro-King movement nationwide. Thousands of people have also been marching in the streets of London, shouting slogans demanding the King's freedom to choose his spouse, and calling Mrs. Simpson "our new queen." General Secretary of the Liverpool Postal Worker's Union Hodgson summoned all the postal workers nationwide, and is to hold an assembly tomorrow. It is said that the following statement would be issued, "all postal workers support the King, but merely hope that the King protect the Constitution."</p>
<p>It is said that the King not only would not concede on Mrs. Simpson, but did not plan to abdicate either. He is to fight for both his lover and the throne. It is further understood that former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill would replace Baldwin, as Churchill has allegedly told Baldwin, "feel free to proceed." The Cabinet is said to have three options: (1) to continue to strongly urge the King to give up Mrs. Simpson, (2) to soften their attitude, which is an unlikely path, or (3) to resign as a first step towards forcing the King to abdicate. It is said that the King would be able to sway national opinion as a show of support. If he were to garner the endorsement of Lord Rothermere's papers, which sell 60 million copies a day, he would topple the government as he had repeatedly done so in the past.</p>
<p>At the same time, Churchill issued a declaration today attacking the government and asking for more time to handle this unexpected problem. Churchill specifically warned the Cabinet not to force the King to abdicate. This declaration is set to be published in the Sunday papers, so it would have a great impact.</p>
<p>In short, the end of this week is an unfortunate time in British history, because no matter how the situation develops, the feelings of all parties have been greatly damaged, and it will take many years to recover. The King hopes that the public's opinion will show that they still want him to remain in the position. As for his marriage, it may not be approved by the general public. If the King were to abdicate, the Prime Minister would probably formally announce it in the House of Commons on Monday morning. The House of Commons would then postpone the meeting until Tuesday to resolve the succession of the Duke of York. The legislatures of the various dominions would also hold similar procedures on Wednesday. The Australian Parliament has scheduled a meeting for Tuesday, so observers feel that the situation is serious. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the marriage issue, there was hope for a turnaround in the situation after Conservative hardliner Churchill made an appeal the other day. Now, since the King has rejected this, it may end in failure. Although the various newspapers belonging to press baron Lord Rothermere have been attacking the government in recent days, when the lord's son went to visit the King at the Belvedere Fort yesterday, the King refused to see him. Therefore, political insiders believe that the King may announce his abdication this afternoon or tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) King Edward has canceled any public meetings scheduled at this time to facilitate handling the current crisis. The most important events of the week are the inspection of the Scottish Guards at the Tower of London on Tuesday morning and the visit to the Staffordshire pottery factories on Wednesday and Thursday. Prime Minister Baldwin revisited the Belvedere Fort, where the King resides. Word has it that the Cabinet will be convening at 5-5:30 this afternoon. The Prime Minister arrived at Belvedere Fort at 6:30 last evening and met with the King for about an hour. Apparently, several documents were presented to the King. When the Prime Minister returned to 10 Downing Street at 8:30, his private secretary informed the press that "nothing more will happen tonight, no one will come here." But shortly after, Home Secretary Simon visited and met with the Prime Minister for two hours. At around 8 o'clock last night, a Royal Mail car drove from Belvedere Fort to London. Because the curtains were drawn, it was not known who was in the car. Other visitors to the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street yesterday included the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Viscount Craigavon. Also, Inspector General Sir Somerville visited the Colonial Office yesterday. At the same time, the Archbishop of Westminster ordered priests and people to unite in prayer for the happiness of the King and the country. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the Attorney General of Cornwall, Monckton, returned from Belvedere Fort in the suburbs, where the King resides, and immediately went to Downing Street to visit Prime Minister Baldwin and discussed the marriage issue. (The King was originally the Duke of Cornwall before being ennobled as Prince of Wales.) Lord Privy Seal MacDonald was also present. Afterwards, a large number of Cabinet members, including the MacDonalds, Home Secretary Simon, First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Minister for Coordination of Defence Inskip, and President of the Board of Trade Runciman, convened at the Prime Minister's Office and the Prime Minister chaired the meeting. Responsible figures stated that the Cabinet members were preparing for the Cabinet meeting scheduled for 5:30 this afternoon. The Prime Minister then took a secretary and drove to Marlborough House to visit Queen Mary and returned to the Prime Minister's Office at 11:50 AM to continue the discussions with his Cabinet members.

<p>(London) Regarding the dispute caused by the marriage issue, political insiders have claimed that the responsibilities of the Attorney General of Cornwall, Monckton, are extremely important. He is in frequent contact with the King, and before meeting with the Prime Minister this morning, he was with the King last night for a long time. If the King were to abdicate, his source of income would depend solely on Cornwall. (The King was the Duke of Cornwall before being ennobled as the Prince of Wales.) However, according to the constitution, the Duke of Cornwall is the King's eldest son, so if the newly established King already has an heir and Edward VIII still wants to receive income from Cornwall, then a new law must be passed.

<h3 id="e63">The Labor Party States: No Intention to Form a Cabinet <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Unwilling to use the King's Private Life</p>
<p>as the Main Goal of the Election</p>
<p>(London) Major Attlee, leader of the parliamentary Labour Party opposition, recently gave an interview to a reporter from this newspaper, saying that Prime Minister Baldwin had not asked him to make any guarantees, and even if the cabinet resigned, he would not come forward to form a cabinet. According to remarks made to the press by Churchill, a lower house member of the extreme Conservative Party, Attlee denied this. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the marriage issue, Churchill, the leader of the extreme Conservatives, made a statement to the press yesterday, roughly saying that Major Attlee, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, had given Prime Minister Baldwin a guarantee that he would not come forward to form a cabinet. In addition to Attlee's personal denial, union officials have also commented on this matter, saying that the issue of forming a cabinet is not something that Major Attlee can decide on his own; it must be decided by the Labour members of the lower house. If these members wish to make a decision, they must convene the Labour Party National Executive Committee for discussion. (Note: The Labour Party National Executive Committee is composed of Labour Party members of parliament, the Labour Party, and the Trade Union Congress.) Labour Party officials say that regardless of the constitutional and religious disputes that the marriage issue may cause, their party has no intention of forming a new cabinet to prepare for a general election. Religious believers are a powerful force in the working class and do not want to use the King's personal issues and private life as the main goal of the election. Moreover, the British monarch originally occupies a position of arbitration between the various political parties. If an election is held because of the King's own problem, it will endanger the traditional status of the British monarch. This is also a concern for religious believers. In short, Labour Party officials urgently hope that the government authorities will inform the public of the situation before a cabinet crisis occurs and that things are not handled hastily.

<p>(London) If King Edward VIII does abdicate, what will he do in the future? This is a matter of great public concern. It is said that the King has always known how to respect himself. In order to avoid the people holding pro-King movements, he does not plan to reside in London for long. He will probably travel elsewhere to relieve his frustrations, and then settle abroad. It is also possible that he will live idly in the south of France, the United States, or Greece. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning at four o'clock, the lights in Belvedere were still on, and cars came and went constantly, causing even more speculation about the King of England's actions. It is said that the King returned to Buckingham Palace last night. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Willing for the King to Descend to the Status of Commoner,</p>
<p>Enjoying Personal Happiness</p>
<p>(London) People generally believe that after the Prime Minister met with Queen Mary this morning and conducted important talks, he urgently wanted to gain the support of all cabinet members, so he "convened a meeting for discussion." Queen Mary originally did not concern herself with politics. Since the King ascended the throne, she has only had two long talks with him. She summons her other children and daughters-in-law from time to time. She summons the Duchess of York the most. She spends her time sewing clothes for various hospitals. As far as people generally know, the Queen Mother cares deeply for her son and would rather the King live as a commoner and enjoy personal happiness than maintain the throne.

<p>A Government that Disregards Public Opinion Will Find it Difficult to Exist</p>
<p>(London) The Evening News recently published a declaration by Lord Rothermere, the newspaper tycoon (who recently traveled around the world and passed through Shanghai), with the headline "Rothermere's Warning," which stated roughly: "You cannot drive away the greatest figure in contemporary Britain during the weekend holiday. (The meaning is the King's abdication.) I have just traveled around the world and can say with certainty that the people of all countries unanimously praise the current King. As for the marriage issue, it should be resolved over time. If it is done hastily, rumors will inevitably arise and affect the King's reputation. In short, any government that disregards public opinion on this matter will find it difficult to exist." (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the marriage issue, newspapers belonging to newspaper tycoon Lord Rothermere are still expressing opposition to the idea of the King's abdication. The Daily Mail European Continental Edition recently published an article stating, "Prime Minister Baldwin said that there is no explicit law regarding the King's private marriage. We should respond by saying that there is no provision in British law for the King's abdication. It is regrettable to pass a law recognizing the King's private marriage, but it will cause harm to pass a law recognizing the King's abdication." The newspaper also expressed concern about the government's hasty handling of the matter and advocated that the King should seek the opinions of prominent politicians on this issue, such as Churchill, a lower house member of the extreme Conservative Party; Sinclair, a lower house member of the opposition Liberal Party; former Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden; former Lord Chancellor Sankey; Major Attlee, leader of the Labour Party; and Morrison, chairman of the London City Council. "Then the responsibility borne by Prime Minister Baldwin can also be reduced." (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(New York) Hearst's evening newspaper published an editorial today stating that although Americans are well aware of the serious constitutional difficulties involved in the British monarch's marriage, they feel that even for a monarch, he should be free to marry the woman he loves, especially if that person is a beautiful and charming American woman. Although this kind of union has no political implications, it certainly does not harm the existing friendship and mutual understanding between Britain and ourselves. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Nice: Mrs. Simpson is currently residing in the villa of Mr. and Mrs. Rogers. There are police guards in front of the door, and no one is allowed to enter. In the past two days, newspaper reporters and photographers from Paris and London have surrounded the villa, but they have not been able to enter. It is believed that Mrs. Simpson and her friends will not make any public statements. The rumor that she met with reporters on the way from Calais to the villa is not true. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) On her way to the Riviera, Mrs. Simpson passed through Vienne in western France. The first person she agreed to meet was a reporter from the Paris Evening News. It is said that she said, "I hope everyone understands that I need to rest quietly in my current environment. I am extremely tired now. The French are very kind, but very disturbing. Since yesterday, I have been followed everywhere I go." Mrs. Simpson continued to answer questions, saying, "I have no plans. Everything depends on the King of England's decision. I am retreating to rest quietly and await the King's decision." Mrs. Simpson tried her best to avoid public attention during her passage through France. When she was in Valence, she passed through many kitchen doors that had been closed for many years, and they were temporarily cleaned by servants. In Vienne, she passed through a cellar door to enter a restaurant. Last night, she arrived in Avignon, fifty miles from Marseille. At that time, her driver asked passers-by for directions to Aix-en-Provence. Later, at 11:35 p.m., she arrived at the village of Le Cannet, and stayed at the home of her American friends, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers. (Reuters News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Le Cannet: Mrs. Simpson arrived here by car at 11:30 tonight after leaving England and arriving in France. Previously, the King of England had called an American friend, Rogers. It is said that the King had indicated that he might abdicate and go to Le Cannet to meet Mrs. Simpson. The King of England's call to Rogers was to inform Rogers that Mrs. Simpson would arrive here soon and stay temporarily at Rogers' place. Tonight, the yacht of Mrs. Phipps, the widow of Prince Brollo of Monte Carlo, suddenly raised its sails and waited to depart. It is said that Mrs. Simpson may take it to avoid the noise in the Mediterranean. Today, a British detective came here by plane to protect Mrs. Simpson. The French government has also specially dispatched two detectives to guard Rogers' villa. At the same time, Rogers has strictly closed the doors and does not allow servants to go out. Before Mrs. Simpson came here, in order to avoid meeting newspaper reporters, she got up at 3:30 in the morning. After arriving in France, she detoured and had lunch at Vienne Station. Her attendant was Sir Brownlow, the former equerry. On the way to Valence, Mrs. Simpson stopped temporarily to talk to a passerby, who later said that Mrs. Simpson said, "Everything is decided by the King. I have no say. Although newspaper reporters are kind and amiable, they are too intrusive." (National Telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>(London) The dispute caused by the marriage issue has now had an impact. The King's coronation ceremony was originally scheduled to be held next May. Several construction factories have begun to build stands between the palace and the parliament, along the streets through which the ceremonial procession will pass, to accommodate the audience. If the King's abdication becomes a reality, the losses from this project will be quite large. In addition, most porcelain factories and cutlery factories have also engraved the King's portrait and commemorative words on their products. Now they must all be destroyed, resulting in considerable losses. Fortunately, a part of it has been insured. Recently, since the marriage issue arose, the insurance premium for this item has increased to 80%. Some handicrafts, such as women's clothing, will continue to work in order to deliver the goods on time, but thousands of workers will inevitably temporarily stop working due to the King's abdication.

<p>(Washington) It was learned here today that Major General Craig, Chief of Staff of the US Army, has submitted his annual report to the Secretary of the Army, stating that the US Army's modernization plan must be completed as soon as possible and not allowed to decline, so as to resist foreign aggression and guarantee national security. Craig praised the morale of the regular army but said that only a small part of the US military can fight immediately, while the military of other countries is already prepared and can fight both domestically and abroad. Therefore, the improvement of the US military is imperative for self-defense, and the US Army is very different from other countries. It not only has no power to invade others but also lacks a complete organization. The so-called regular army has very few people, and the strength to cope with war is far less, but its responsibility is very heavy. At present, only the field artillery brigade has been motorized, and there is also an anti-aircraft artillery brigade with modern equipment. As for chemical warfare supplies, although 20,000 gas masks have been prepared this year, many are still lacking, and 100,000 more should be added each year to meet the needs. Regarding the improvement of coastal defenses, the Army Department has also allocated funds to proceed. As for the number of aircraft stipulated by law on July 1, four-fifths can be manufactured.

<h3 id="e74">Chahar-Beibei Bandit Puppet Army Suffers Heavy Losses in Counterattack on Bailing: A Certain Party Rectifies Bandit Troops and Plans to Counterattack Again: Bandit Morale Dispersed and Many Revolt and Surrender <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Suiyuan Correspondence: Since our side recovered Bailing Temple, the only base in northern Sui that the puppet bandits had been preparing for a very long time was seized by the National Army. All of a certain party's plans to invade Sui over the years were taken by our forces. A certain party's ambition has not diminished. After the puppet bandit troops fled in disarray, on one hand, they concentrated on rectification in the Damaozi area, more than 100 li northeast of Bailing Temple, and on the other hand, they concentrated puppet bandits in Shangdu, Chahar, and transferred puppet troops from Rehe, attempting to invade again on both sides of eastern and northern Sui. In recent days, in addition to bandit planes visiting for reconnaissance every day, there has been no formal disturbance. The bandit planes also dare not fly low because they fear the accuracy of our anti-aircraft guns. Sure enough, at dawn on the 4th, the puppet bandits, consisting of the Wang Ying, Jin Jiashan, and Li Shouxin units, totaling 4,000 to 5,000 men, gathered at Damaozi and suddenly launched a counterattack on our side's position at Bailing Temple. There were also hundreds of ronin recruited by a certain party in Dalian, carrying cannons and light and heavy machine guns, and they launched a fierce attack on us. At the same time, eight or nine airplanes provided cover and carried out bombing. Our garrison all had the determination to advance without retreating and to be invincible, and the morale of our army's various units was extremely high. All felt honored to be able to go to the front to kill the enemy and regretted not being able to reach the front. Therefore, although the bandit puppets came fiercely, our army bravely stepped forward and met the attack. After 10 o'clock, the battle was very fierce. Our army became more and more courageous and fought with a hundred times the morale. The puppet bandits were ultimately a rabble, and the lure of money could not ultimately change their lives, so they fled again like rats. Our side also captured more than 200 bandits. According to the captured bandits, a certain party spends all day rectifying the puppet bandit troops and said that our army at Bailing Temple is very weak and can be taken immediately. A certain party actively supplements the puppet bandits with a large number of guns and distributes many airplanes and poison gas, etc. Although the puppet bandits suffered this heavy blow, they occupy the nearby two hilltops, attempting to counterattack again. Our garrison is not only determined to defend Bailing Temple but also has the ambition to eliminate the remaining bandits in Sui, and it is thought that there will inevitably be fierce battles in the next two or three days. The puppet bandits have suffered repeated heavy blows, and bandit morale is dispersed. The date of resolution should not be far off.</p>
<p>Chahar-Beibei Militias Revolt One After Another</p>
<p>According to talks with people from Xinghe, since the puppet bandits began to invade Xinghe on November 17, they have been repeatedly attacked fiercely by our garrison, merchants' associations, and security teams. The bandits completely collapsed on the 29th, and there is no trace of bandits in Xinghe. Only 700 to 800 puppet bandits Zhang Paodan (i.e., Zhang Wanqing) still occupy Nanchaoqian. (However, the bandits have no fighting spirit and are dispersing. Puppet bandit regiment commander Su Wanlong was indeed killed by our army. Wang Ying has not been seen since he fled alone from Honggeertu.) The people and militias of Chahar-Beibei, unable to withstand the oppression of the puppet bandits and stimulated by the nationwide patriotic movement, have revolted one after another. Several hundred have already surrendered to the Xinghe Security Office. It is rumored that a certain regimental commander of Li Shouxin's unit is preparing to declare independence. The Yihe Commercial Firm has opened its doors and is operating as usual, and people's hearts are also very stable.</p>
<p>Major Disaster in Honggeertu</p>
<p>In the battle of Honggeertu, the local people suffered huge losses. The Taolin County government sent people to conduct detailed surveys. Three or four tenths of the houses were destroyed, and three or four blockhouses were destroyed. A total of 22 people were killed and injured, including three women, with 11 deaths and 11 injuries. The county sent personnel to comfort them with money, with 10 yuan for each severely injured person and 6 yuan for each lightly injured person, ordering them to seek treatment nearby. After the puppet bandits invaded Yihe this time, the villagers in the county were looted and burned by the bandits, and the disaster situation was also serious. Now, the telegraph from Xinghe County Magistrate Meng Zhongwen requesting disaster relief from the Sui Provincial Government is recorded on the left to give a glimpse. Urgent: Chairman Fu, Civil Affairs Department Director Yuan, Finance Department Director Li Junjian, check that more than 20 villages, including Yaozigou, Dajiankou, Halagou, Village 29, Huangyuwa, Shuangnaobao, Village 3, Fuzhixiang, Village 16, Dahalacun, Xiahalacun in Xinghe District 1, and Qingyuxiang, Zhang Bayin Village, Haojiagangfang, Village 2, and Si Ni's Dengjia Village, Village 2, and Yushuwa in District 2, were all occupied by the puppet bandits this time. People, horses, grain, clothing, livestock were all looted, and several people were killed and injured. Houses were also burned. Now the bandits have retreated completely, but the disaster-stricken people in each village are displaced and without food or clothing at this time of cold weather. They are suffering from hunger and cold and are in a miserable state. We are supervising Deputy Security Director Han Jingyu and each instructor to conduct detailed surveys, provide appropriate comfort, and set up temporary shelters in nearby villages that have not been bandit-stricken to resettle the refugees and prevent them from freezing and starving. In addition to reporting the details of the disaster in a separate case, we respectfully report and request the allocation of disaster relief funds to help with relief. (4th)</p>

<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The "Aoi" and "Ogi" destroyers of the 14th Destroyer Division of the Japanese Lushun Naval Base arrived at Tanggu from Qinhuangdao and Lushun respectively on the morning of the 5th and moored in front of the Japanese barracks wharf. The destroyer team has a total of three warships. The "Kiku" warship arrived at Tanggu at the end of November. As of the 5th, Tanggu has berthed a team of Japanese destroyers. The North China Japanese Garrison Headquarters stipulates that from the 9th to the 12th of this month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day, it will conduct land-sea coordination combat exercises in the area of Dabizhuang, Sunzhuang, and Fanzhuang in the suburbs of Tianjin in conjunction with the Marine Corps of the three warships of the 14th Destroyer Division, taking Tianjin City as the target of contention. The mobilization will be between 2,000 and 3,000 people, and the commander of the 14th Destroyer Division, Sometoshi Hisameteru, and the commander of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the North China Garrison, Huangdao, will be responsible for the command. This is an unprecedented example in recent years. Commander Tadashi specially took a special train on the Beining Railway to Tanggu at 8:30 a.m. on the 5th with Infantry Brigade Commander Kawabe, Chief of Staff Hashimoto, Aide-de-Camp Sasaki, and Department Attachment Suzuki to inspect the Marine Corps of the three warships and to discuss the very cautious measures in the serious situation in North China with Commander Hisameteru, the commanders of the "Kiku," "Aoi," and "Ogi," Lieutenants Kaneko, Koga, and Kunibu, in the Tanggu barracks, before returning to Tianjin at 2:00 p.m. Kayashima will arrange the various matters of the exercise starting on the 6th. The chemical machine warfare team in the Dongjuzi barracks in Tianjin will also send a part of it to participate at that time.</p>
<p>The Qingdao Incident occurred, and the situation in Suiyuan became like a raging fire. After Tadashi and Hashimoto finished their military inspection in the Qinhuangdao-Yuyu-Tang area and returned to Tianjin on the 3rd, they convened an important meeting at the Haiguang Temple Headquarters at 2:00 p.m. on the 4th. Military Attaches Matsumuro and Hamada stationed in Pingjin, Brigade Commander Kawabe, Military Attache Obamoto stationed in Zhangjiakou, and Military Attache Hayama stationed in Suiyuan arrived early in the morning to participate. The Kwantung Army Department sent Lieutenant Colonel Fukushima Maruhei on the morning of the 3rd to wait in Tianjin with Okamoto, the staff officer of the Rehe garrison, to attend the meeting that day. The meeting discussed the current situation, diplomacy, military deployment, and the Suiyuan and Qingdao incidents in detail for a long time before adjourning at 5:00 p.m. Obamoto and Hayama flew back to Zhang and Sui on the morning of the 5th. Matsumuro had to rush to hand over because he was transferred to the commander of the 4th Cavalry Brigade and returned to Pingjin on the evening of the 5th. Before his successor Major General Matsui took office, he was temporarily maintained by Major Hamada. At the meeting on the 4th, the North China Garrison Headquarters considered that the attitude of the Navy side regarding the Qingdao Incident was not fully understood. In order to establish close contact, it sent Staff Officer Lieutenant Colonel Wakachi to Qingdao by Huizhou Company plane at 8:00 a.m. on the 5th to meet Commander Okawa of the 3rd Fleet to exchange opinions and to give instructions to Military Attache Taniogi stationed there. He will return to Tianjin on the 6th to report. According to observations of the Tianjin military headquarters' movements, if the Qingdao Incident expands, it may take unanimous action to support it remotely. As for the Navy, Commander Sometoshi Hisameteru of the 14th Destroyer Division, Commanders Kaneko and Koga of the "Kiku" and "Aoi," and Staff Officer Lieutenant Suzuki came to Tianjin from Qinhuangdao and Tanggu on the morning of the 4th. Chief of Staff Hara Chuuichi of the Lushun Naval Base and Staff Officer Kamite came to Tianjin on the night of the 3rd to convene an important meeting with the Tianjin Naval Attache Kubota and Lieutenant Colonel Kuwahara at the Tianjin Naval Attache Office on Qiushan Street at 10:00 a.m. on the 4th. Kubota presided over the meeting and discussed the current situation, the Qingdao Incident, and the so-called emergency situation, the Bohai Bay alert, and the coordination between the army and the navy to protect overseas Chinese in detail, and a concrete decision was made before adjourning at about 1:00 p.m. Chief of Staff Hara took a plane back to Lushun on the morning of the 5th to report the decision of this meeting to Commander Wada. The Japanese 14th Destroyer Division believes that North China is within its alert line and will be stationed in Tanggu for a long time. It originally planned to sail to Tianjin next week, but now the Haihe River is shallow, so it has to dock there temporarily. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">After China's Opening to Navigation, Plans Emerge for Military Air Routes; Problems with the Longyan Mine and Jinshi Railway are Temporarily Suspended; Our Side Has Not Yet Recognized the Military Air Route Issue <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the issue of economic cooperation between Hebei, Chahar, and Japan, since its commencement, the restoration of the Longyan Iron Mine and the construction of the Jinshi Railway have been decided upon successively. However, the Hebei-Chahar authorities have repeatedly stated that everything can be handled on the principle of not hindering national sovereignty and benefiting the people, and that it is preferable to invest. At the same time, Lu Zongyu was appointed to prepare for the Longyan Iron Mine, and the Communications Committee was responsible for building the Jinshi Road. Since the commencement, the part of the Longyan Iron Mine to be taken over is roughly in order, and there are also ways to raise funds for the debt. However, when it will be mined depends on when the funds are available. However, the authorities believe that the restoration and mining of Longyan should be invested by foreign parties and handled by our own side, which is in line with the principles they adhere to. Otherwise, it would be detrimental to national rights. The Japanese side hopes that it will be jointly run by China and Japan, so as to control half of the power. Since the opinions of both parties are different, this is the reason why it has been delayed. This issue is currently being studied by Lu Zongyu, who is in charge. Lu is negotiating everything in Tianjin, but it is said that there is no progress. The construction of the Jinshi Road is also temporarily suspended due to the different opinions of both parties on investment and joint operation. The relevant authorities are carefully considering the solution, and there are still some difficulties in realizing the facts. As for the navigation issue, it is being handled in accordance with the original plan of the former Political Affairs Readjustment Committee. Because the unauthorized flight of Japanese aircraft damages national rights, it is hoped that Japanese aircraft will stop flying immediately after the opening of navigation. This is why the Huitong Company was organized. After the company was established, the Japanese side once again expressed its intention to open military air routes. The authorities did not agree. The Japanese side then hoped to stipulate the military air period. This issue has not yet been resolved. According to a certain authority, the reason why the Japanese side raised this opinion is that the navigation between China and the the US, China and the UK, and China and Germany contains military characteristics. This is actually a misunderstanding, because these three lines are purely commercial and have no side effects. After explanation, it should not become a problem.

<h3 id="e78">Japanese Transporting Smuggled Goods to Shandong; Han Fuqu Orders Detention and Transfer to Relief; Dozens of Japanese Go to the Provincial Government and Strongly Demand to See Han; Goods Detained are Returned by Koreans to the Japanese Consulate <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The trend of smuggling has become very prevalent again recently. Although our customs anti-smuggling department has strictly investigated, it has not been curbed. Moreover, a certain party used the Jinpu Railway for transportation. After being blocked by the anti-smuggling department and unable to travel smoothly, it changed to using cars to travel south from Tianjin to sell in northern Shandong. Each time, Japanese and Koreans escorted the goods. Last month, officials from the Jinan anti-smuggling department discovered two smuggling cars in Luokou. Both the people and the goods were transported to Jinan. In a short time, hundreds of Japanese and Koreans arrived, demanding the return of the smuggled goods and beating and insulting the officials of the anti-smuggling department and the road police, rampaging and disregarding everything. Since then, their arrogance has become more intense, and they openly transport goods almost every day. Han Fuqu, chairman of Shandong Province, recently received an order to provide effective assistance to anti-smuggling work. Moreover, white powder drugs were openly carried in the smuggled goods, destroying the anti-drug results in Shandong Province. He then issued an order to all counties in northern Shandong to strictly investigate and arrest. After receiving the order, Wang Ying, the magistrate of Leling County, ordered Li Jiaomin, the captain of the security team, to lead his troops to pay attention to investigation and arrest at various key intersections. On the 3rd and 4th of this month, 17 cargo cars (including one car) were detained one after another. The cars were full of smuggled goods such as rayon, white sugar, cigarette paper, and drugs. Dozens of Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese escorted the cars. After the detention, the provincial government was reported and asked for instructions on how to deal with it. Chairman Han telegraphed to escort them to Jinan. Li Jiaomin, the head of the security department of the county, escorted them with the police. On the evening of the 4th, they stayed in Shanghe County, and continued south on the 5th. Chairman Han was afraid of accidents, so he sent soldiers from the pistol brigade to meet them at Luokou and escort them to the provincial government. From dawn to noon, the smuggled goods arrived one after another, totaling 74 packages of rayon, 171 packages of white sugar, 23 packages of cloth, 50 packages of cigarette paper, two white boxes, one small leather box, and another 87 packages of drugs (the boxes also contained drugs). After arriving at the provincial government, in addition to checking the vehicles and goods, the Japanese and Koreans were placed in the reception room, and the Chinese were handed over to the military law office for interrogation by Chairman Han. At 2 pm, the Japanese Consul Yano Manabu visited Han at the provincial government, requesting the return of the people and goods. Han replied that he would deal with it after he had inquired. At 3 pm, after inquiring, he handed over eight Japanese and eighteen Koreans to Kan, the director of the Japanese Consulate, and the head of the Japanese Police Department, who were brought back by the provincial government. In addition, officials from the military law office and officials from the Japanese Consulate identified the goods and detained them in the provincial government. The 15 Chinese who drove the cars were escorted to the military law office for appropriate disposal later.</p>
<p>Also, at 1 pm, while the interrogation was in progress, dozens of Japanese, all wearing short clothes, suddenly came to the provincial government and claimed that they wanted to see Chairman Han. Han did not see them because he was busy. The Japanese still refused to leave. The guards of the provincial government then showed their swords and raised their guns, making considerable warning. It was not until the Japanese and Koreans were taken away by the staff of the Japanese Consulate that they began to disperse, without causing any trouble. Also, at 4 pm, Shanghe County also detained a car of smuggled goods and sent it to Luokou. The Japanese in the car lay on the ground to prevent the car from leaving. The goods were still in Luokou that evening and had not arrived at the provincial government.</p>

<p>Continuing to Handle Land Registration</p>
<p>Hu Pinfang, director of the Land Administration Bureau of this county, has been carrying out land registration in various rural areas for half a year, and the results have been quite good. The land registration in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th districts has been completed in order. After active planning, the land registration in the 2nd, 8th, and 5th districts will continue to be carried out, and all will be completed by the end of this year. Starting from New Year's Day next year, the land registration in the first district will be handled. It is stipulated that four registration offices will be set up inside and outside the city. The registration fee is one dime per land. The registration period is ten days, and must not exceed fifteen days at most. As soon as the registration is completed, the land ownership certificate will be issued.</p>
<p>Three Tragic Changes for the Barge Household</p>
<p>Ji Qingshan, a local resident, is over forty years old and has been working as a barge for a living, traveling between Wuxi and Shanghai, carrying goods for others. A few days ago, Ji loaded hundreds of boxes of kerosene and transported them from Suzhou to Wuxi. However, after traveling only a few miles, the entire ship capsized due to excessive weight, resulting in heavy losses. The next day, the ship was lifted out and transported to Wuxi. When the ship arrived at Dangkou Town in the seventh district of this county, a strong wind suddenly rose, and the mast on the ship broke in response. Qing Shan's son, Rong Gui, was seven years old, and his head was crushed by the mast, and his brain burst, and he died immediately. Until about 11 am the day before yesterday, the ship arrived under the Gongyun Bridge and stopped to unload the kerosene. I don't know how, but the cabin was lost again, and it was out of control. Qing Shan's eldest son, Rong Guan, ten years old, was burned on his left arm, chest, and face. It can be said to be tragic.</p>
<p>Fraudulent Money Arrested and Imprisoned</p>
<p>Qian Hongsheng, a native of Changshou, Jiangyin, in July of this year, under the name of the manager of the Yongxing Coal Mine Company stationed in Xishan, established an office in Zhoushanbang, this county, and contacted all parties, claiming that he would invest 200 yuan to be sent to other counties as manager, 100 yuan as associate, and 50 yuan as a worker. This money would be used as a security deposit for future service. Fu Zuyin, who lives on Tonghui Road, believed it to be true and paid fifty yuan for a worker position. Later, the office moved to the west gate. Fu repeatedly urged Qian, but Qian kept procrastinating. In September, he fled without a trace. Fu knew that he had been deceived and could only call in vain. At 2 pm yesterday, he met Qian Hongsheng at Tonghui Bridge, and often twisted him into the second branch of the public security bureau under his jurisdiction, and transferred him to the general bureau, and then transferred him to the court for interrogation and detention.</p>

<p>The Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Zhitang in the Fifth District broke up a counterfeit currency agency in the town on the 4th.

Sun Yu'er, Liu Fulian, Chen Zhaodong, and other three people from Jiangbei on the boat came to the town to purchase goods, and used a lot of money, which aroused suspicion among the local people. The police were then reported to board the ship for inspection, and seized 380 yuan of counterfeit banknotes of the Central Bank, including three types of one yuan, five yuan and five jiao, sixty-five jiao of lead double counterfeit auxiliary coins, and printing machines and printing plates. Sun and others were immediately detained and brought to the city, and sent to the county for interrogation on the 5th.</p>

<p>According to Chen Xiaoqin, a resident of Baisha Road, Hejiao, on the evening of the 3rd, a salt police team from Yuyue Dongsan Township stationed at a stove reported that someone was trafficking in contraband salt behind Shengshan. Kang Yongnian, the captain of the team, sent a tax policeman, Xie Yuezhong, to accompany Chen to arrest him. When they arrived, four or five smugglers were trafficking. They opened fire to arrest them. A smuggler, Xu Yaolin, and a boat of contraband salt were captured. Because the police force was weak, the prisoner was freed and went. The police then told Chen to guard the contraband salt and went to the team headquarters to request police assistance. The escaped smugglers Xu Yaolin, Shi Youjin, Xu Shengchao, etc., saw that the tax police had left, and then twisted Chen, cut off ten fingers with a knife, and then cut him twenty times all over his body. Later, they threw him into the river, intending to destroy the traces. Fortunately, Chen had a breath left and slowly climbed to the river bank. At this time, the tax police brigade had arrived, and then they sent him to the court to examine the injury, and at the same time pursued the murderer for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Huang Fu Passed Away Yesterday Morning. Mrs. Huang Telegraphed Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang. All Bureaus and Offices Under the Municipal Government Flew Flags at Half-Mast to Express Grief. The Encoffining Ceremony Will Be Held at the China Funeral Home Tomorrow at 3 PM. His Last Words Offered Loyal Advice to His Countrymen and Neighboring Countries. <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>National Government Member Huang Fu passed away at 9:25 AM yesterday morning at his residence on Qiqi Road in the French Concession, at the age of 57. His close friends during his lifetime, such as Vice President of the Executive Yuan Kong Xiangxi, Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, Industry Minister Wu Dingchang, and former Interior Minister Xu Xiuzhi, all went to offer condolences. His remains are scheduled to be moved to the China Funeral Home on Haig Road at 9 AM this morning, and the encoffining ceremony will be held at 3 PM the day after tomorrow (the 8th). The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Failure to Recover</p>
<p>Huang's liver cancer had shown some improvement after treatment by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners Fan Shisheng and Liu Zhengzi for two months. Unexpectedly, his condition changed suddenly one evening, exacerbated by emotional distress, and the illness worsened. By the morning of the second day, he had fallen into a coma. Although he showed some improvement after medical intervention, his long-term illness made recovery impossible, and he passed away at his residence on Qiqi Road in the French Concession at 9:25 AM yesterday morning. Huang had always been known for his robust health. Two years ago, he began to feel some local discomfort, which gradually worsened. He consulted famous Western doctors from various countries, but after exploratory surgery, it was determined that he had terminal liver cancer, for which there was no effective treatment, and they all gave up. He then consulted traditional Chinese medicine practitioners Fan and Liu, but ultimately, his weakened body could not be saved.</p>
<p>Illness Progression</p>
<p>According to those close to Huang, the progression of his illness was as follows: Huang had always been extremely healthy during his prime. Two years ago, he began to feel some local discomfort, but he initially did not pay much attention to it. After taking charge of the affairs of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Reorganization Committee, he began to feel overwhelmed by the heavy workload, and various ailments such as nosebleeds and arm pain arose. He sought medical treatment, and his condition improved and relapsed intermittently. This summer, his condition worsened, and Huang was residing in Mogan Mountain. To facilitate medical treatment, he arrived in Shanghai on August 24th and was admitted to Hong En Hospital for treatment on the 27th. After more than a month in the hospital, there was no improvement. To diagnose the root cause of his illness, he underwent surgery at the hospital on September 14th, which revealed that he had liver cancer, deemed a terminal illness, and he refused further treatment. After the surgery, not only was the cancer not removed, but his condition worsened, with abdominal pain and coughing, and a significant decrease in appetite. To alleviate the patient's suffering, the doctors administered heavy doses of anesthetics daily, concluding that Huang's condition would deteriorate rapidly and he would not live much longer. On September 28th, he planned to hire a German expert to fly to Shanghai for treatment, but this did not happen. Later, as famous Western doctors from various countries in Shanghai all gave up, he hired traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Fan Shisheng, who flew from Lushan to Shanghai for treatment. By the time Fan arrived in Shanghai, Huang was already feeling overwhelmed, irritable, and concerned about national affairs. After Fan's careful treatment, there seemed to be hope for recovery. Later, he hired the famous doctor Liu Zhengzi, who came to Shanghai from Shaanxi to assist in the treatment, and his condition improved further. On November 25th, to facilitate taking Chinese medicine, he left the hospital and returned to his residence. On the night of December 1st, his condition suddenly changed. Huang's eldest daughter had already arrived in Shanghai from Beijing to care for him. That night, Huang suddenly felt a stabbing pain, and his condition worsened, leading to a coma. He passed away at 9:25 AM on the morning of the sixth.</p>
<p>Condolences from Friends</p>
<p>Huang was briefly conscious on the afternoon of the fifth, but then lapsed back into unconsciousness. He regained consciousness again at 10 PM, and was able to speak, asking those present about national affairs, and saying that China could only survive if the whole country united to resist invasion. At 2 AM yesterday morning, his condition became more critical. After emergency injections by doctors, he was able to hang on for a few more hours. At around 8 AM, his breathing became intermittent, and his family knew that he could not be saved. They separately notified Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, former Interior Minister Xu Xiuzhi, former Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang, and Municipal Works Bureau Director Shen Yi, among others, by phone to bid him farewell. After Huang's death, Mrs. Huang, Shen Jingying, telegraphed Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, and friends in various places to report the news. Vice President of the Executive Yuan Kong Xiangxi, Industry Minister Wu Dingchang, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission member Xie Zhongfu, and Railway Bureau Director Huang Boqiao, who are currently in Shanghai, all went to offer condolences within an hour of Huang's death. Mayor of Shanghai Wu Tiecheng, Shanghai Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Director of the Foreign Ministry's Shanghai Office Zhou Jue, and Huang's friends during his lifetime all went to offer condolences and pay their respects to his remains in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Establishment of Funeral Committee</p>
<p>Mrs. Huang had been caring for the patient for months, and her health was already failing. Witnessing his death, she was overwhelmed with grief, almost collapsing. Therefore, Huang's funeral arrangements will be handled by his friends Zhang Qun, Xu Xiuzhi, Xu Qingfu (who arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday afternoon), Tao Lüqian (who arrived in Shanghai this morning), Yuan Liang, and Shen Yi, among others. A funeral committee will be established immediately, and the funeral committee has issued a separate announcement regarding Huang's funeral arrangements, emphasizing simplicity, as Huang had always disliked superficiality, valued practicality, and possessed the spirit of promoting the New Life Movement. He was also a devout Buddhist, practicing Mahayana Buddhism, and repeatedly spoke of simplicity during his illness. The decision of his friends not to accept any gifts is in line with his wishes and serves to correct social customs. The Encoffining Ceremony Tomorrow.</p>
<p>Huang's remains are scheduled to be moved from his private residence on Qiqi Road to the China Funeral Home on Haig Road at 9 AM this morning. The arrangement of the mourning hall was completed yesterday afternoon. Reception staff will be provided by Huang's friends, and the municipal government will also send staff to assist with the funeral arrangements. Huang's relatives and friends who live in various places will arrive by noon tomorrow. The date of the encoffining ceremony has been set for 3 PM tomorrow (the 8th). More than thirty telegrams of condolence from various places arrived in Shanghai last night.</p>
<p>Flags at Half-Mast to Express Grief</p>
<p>After learning of Huang's death, Mayor Wu immediately telegraphed Nanjing and Luoyang to report to the National Government and President Chiang. As Huang was the first mayor of Shanghai, Mayor Wu ordered all bureaus and offices under the municipal government to fly flags at half-mast for one day to express grief in memory of Huang.</p>
<p>Publication of Last Words</p>
<p>I have lived for fifty-seven years. Recalling my youth, I encountered the difficulties of the Jiawu and Gengzi years. Stirred by patriotic righteousness, I put down my pen and took up arms, discussing ways to save the country with like-minded patriots. The first step was fundamental reform. After going to Japan, I followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Ke Qiang, and Yingshi to engage in revolution. With the Xinhai Revolution, I thought we could devote ourselves to construction and disarm and disband soldiers. Unexpectedly, after only one year, this nascent force was crushed. Since then, the struggle between positive and negative forces has undergone several changes until the rise of the National Army in the thirteenth year of the Republic, when the revolutionary forces were deeply rooted in the north. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, the National Revolutionary Army rose up and the revolutionary forces unified the country. In my humble capacity, I participated in these battles, surviving many near-death experiences. I had long resolved to dedicate myself to the country. In recent years, national strength has been insufficient, and foreign aggression has been imminent. Remembering the difficulties of creation by the martyrs and the severity of the current crisis, I ventured to overcome difficulties and accepted the mandate of the Beiping Reorganization Committee to support the north and ease the overall situation. Now, fortunately, construction is advancing rapidly, unification has been completed, and international responses are more than adequate compared to the past. I can die without regret at this time with a melancholic liver disease. However, there is something I cannot forget. An individual life is no more than a grain of millet in a granary, but the life of a nation should coexist with the earth. We are members of the nation, and the life of the nation is our individual life. Taking advantage of my last breath, I offer my last loyal advice to my countrymen and neighboring countries with tears: 1. In times of national crisis, there must be a spirit and action of national unity. Now, our political leader, General Chiang, is loyal to the country, has endured hardships, and has the unshirkable responsibility of leading the revival. The people should transcend subjective emotions and trust him with one heart, doing everything with great sympathy, doing their best to assist, and remembering that the world situation is dangerous and the national destiny is new. In all aspects, inspire the enthusiasm for building the country, do calm work, and accumulate the strength that a modern country should have at the level of the modern era to await the opportunity for national mobilization. The government should also be extremely tolerant of the people, giving full play to its broad-mindedness in selecting and appointing talents, so that the experienced and the promising can express their intelligence and talents, so that there will be no talents left in the wild, and demonstrate the reality of national unity. 2. Eastern civilization has its own great value. There is no reason for the two countries of China and Japan, which share the same race and culture, to harm each other. However, while touting friendship, they are defending their mistakes. After the four northeastern provinces, they are hoping to further plot North China to shield their man-made pseudo-organization. This is not only an impassable road for the 400 million Chinese who have awakened, but will also cause endless disputes. This is not only a great misfortune for us, but also an unsafe path for the neighboring country itself. If this is not changed, the so-called coexistence and co-prosperity will inevitably fall into common decline and chaos. The neighboring country has always respected Confucianism and should urgently consider the meaning of Confucius and Mencius's forgiveness and implement it by resolutely abandoning its attempts in North China, and then seeking a solution to return our sovereignty in the four northeastern provinces, then friendship will naturally be realized and everything will be solved easily. Following this to seek the liberation of the Asian nations, to glorify Eastern civilization, and to create a blessing for mankind, is it not merely the coexistence and co-prosperity of the two countries? The above two points are related to the national and even the ethnic life of Asia. Now that I am about to part ways with the world, the feeling of worrying about the country cannot be suppressed. I respectfully leave these words. November 26, 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Huang Fu's Biography</p>
<p>Huang Fu, styled Yingbai, was originally from Songjiang, Jiangsu. Because his father, Mr. Wenzhi, served as an official in eastern Zhejiang, he was born in Baiguan Town, and entered the school in Qiantang, and thus registered his household there. In his youth, he studied and liked mathematics. He first taught at the Anji County School. Later, after witnessing the national disasters of the Jiawu and Gengzi years, he lamented the weakness of the country and entered the Hangzhou Military Academy to study the army. He achieved top grades in the entire school. At that time, many patriots gathered in the school, and there was a secret organization that advocated revolution. Two years later, the entire school selected the best students to study in Japan, and he went to Japan. At that time, the Premier was launching the organization of the Tongmenghui, and Tokyo was the center of the revolutionary movement. He gathered many army students to join the alliance, and in order to realize that revolution must have strength, he formed the "Manhood Corps" among the army comrades of the Tongmenghui, which was later expanded into the "Chengcheng Corps," which was dedicated to implementing plans. He also published the Wuxue magazine. During the restoration of the Xinhai Revolution, the new armies of the provinces responded unexpectedly, which was based on the organization of military comrades. Mr. Huang relied on his superior mathematics and entered the Army Survey Bureau. After graduating, he planned to join the military and became a member of the Military Advisory Office, secretly connecting with comrades in the north. At the beginning of the Xinhai Revolution, he took the opportunity to go south to assist Chen Gong Yingshi in planning the advance, and served as the Chief of Staff of the Shanghai Military Government. He also trained a division himself and served as the commander of the 23rd Division. All the regulations of the Shanghai Army, as well as the joint attack on Nanjing by the armies and the establishment of the provisional government, were largely due to his planning. Later, the General Headquarters of the Nanjing Garrison was established, and Mr. Huang also served as the Director-General of the Garrison. After the unification of the North and South, public opinion focused on reducing the army, and the two governorates of Jiangsu and Shanghai merged, so he served as the Chief of Staff of the Jiangsu Governorate, and he took the lead in disbanding the 23rd Division himself. The following year, the Song case occurred, and the Second Revolution broke out. He assisted Chen Gong Yingshi again in establishing the military department in Shanghai and capturing the manufacturing bureau. He then fled to Japan, and Yuan Shikai offered a large sum of money to capture him. Soon, he went to the United States to study. In the fourth year of the Republic, the Chu'an Society was established, and he returned to Shanghai by a fast route to sponsor the independence of Zhejiang, responding to the provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi. After the matter was settled, he retired to Tianjin to devote himself to writing and lecturing. Except for a period of time when he joined forces with Mr. Zhang Jingyu to advocate the peace movement to support the Dharma-Protecting Army, he did not ask about politics. His famous two works, "The Lessons of the European War and the Future of China" and "The World After the War," were published at this time. In the eighth year of the Republic, he went to the United States again to investigate the economy. Soon after, the Washington Conference was held, and he was ordered to participate. He made many plans for the recovery of Qingdao. After returning to China, Mr. Wang Liangchou formed a cabinet and appointed him to oversee the National Financial Conference. Soon after, Mr. Zhang Jingyu formed a cabinet and took charge of foreign affairs. Later, he entered the cabinet twice to lead education. With his spare strength, he lectured at Peking University and in the army of Mr. Feng Huanzhang in Nanyuan. He was especially close to Feng, and secretly discussed the connection of the national revolutionary front. In the 13th year of the Republic, Feng's National Army returned from Gubeikou and formed the regency cabinet. The Premier went to Tianjin and immediately sent Mr. Wang Jingwei to visit Mr. Huang to discuss everything. As a result, the National Army became a powerful element in expanding the revolutionary base in the north. At that time, General Chiang was working in Guangdong and sent a secret telegram to Mr. Huang, saying that he wished him to serve Mr. Sun as he served his eldest brother, referring to Chen Yingshi. In the 15th year of the Republic, the National Revolutionary Army went to the Yangtze River, and General Chiang welcomed him to Jiangxi, making many suggestions for the progress of the revolution. The National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and he served as the first mayor of Shanghai. In the 17th year of the Republic, he served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Later, he went to Mogan Mountain to cultivate himself, study Buddhist scriptures, and established Mogan Elementary School as the center for improving the Mogan Mountain farming village. Before and after the September 18th Incident, he secretly presented many plans to the government authorities to save the situation, and united with celebrities from all walks of life to launch the New China Construction Society to study various construction programs. In the 22nd year, the National Government established the Administrative Yuan in Beiping in a crisis in Tianjin, and specially appointed Mr. Huang as the chairman of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee, ordering him to rush to Beiping to govern. After two years of negotiations, he became depressed and fell ill. In the 24th year, he asked for leave to return south to recuperate. At first, he thought it was a stomach disease. It was not until the spring of this year that he learned it was a liver disease. In the early autumn, he entered Hongen Hospital, where doctors tried to cure it with surgery, but only then did he learn that it was liver cancer. Later, he took Chinese medicine, which he felt was effective, but ultimately the root of the disease was too deep, and he passed away at the hour of the day on December 6. He has two daughters, the eldest named Xiwen and the second named Xizhi. Before his death, he was still concerned about national affairs and left a will, which was recorded by his wife, Shen Jingying, and he instructed his wife to be frugal with the funeral and use the remaining money to run education.</p>

At 5 PM, he will leave Shanghai and go north to Pingjin. At that time, the honor guard was originally planned to be dispatched by the Garrison Command, the Security Corps Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau.

<p>Guangzhou Mayor Zeng Yangfu flew to Shanghai from Guangdong on the China National Aviation Corporation's Guangdong Mail Plane at 6:35 AM yesterday morning, arriving here at 3:40 PM on the same day, landing at Longhua Airport. After disembarking, Zeng went straight to his residence to rest. According to Zeng, he came here to attend the board meeting of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The date of his return to the south has not yet been determined. The current situation in Guangzhou is very good. Bai Chongxi is about to come north to Nanjing. As for whether Bai will go abroad, nothing has been heard. Song Ziwen went to Guilin this morning (the 6th) and is scheduled to return to Guangdong and then to Shanghai the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Sun Ke's Talk <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Suiyuan Bandit Suppression is Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>The Qingdao Incident Will Not Lead to Expansion</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, accompanied by Legislative Member Fu Bingchang and others, left Nanjing by night train at 11 o'clock the night before last and arrived at Zhenru at 6:50 yesterday morning. He went directly to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest, then went out to visit friends at 9:30 and went to his residence in the Xuhui district to offer sacrifices. At noon, he met with a reporter from the Central News Agency at his residence. According to him, the situation in Suiyuan is tense, and our military operations are proceeding smoothly. However, if the base of the bandit forces in Chahar North is not recovered soon, it is cause for great concern. The landing of Japanese naval marines in Qingdao clearly contains a threatening nature, but the situation is expected not to escalate. The term of the current Legislative Yuan will inevitably be extended to await the National Assembly's generation of new members. The general public believes that the German-Japanese agreement is anti-communist in nature and has nothing to do with us. In fact, it is enough to fuel Japan's aggressive ambitions and has a direct impact on our country.</p>

<p>Lending Method</p>
<p>After the meeting, according to the design committee member Hua Wenyu's words to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter, the three resolutions of the meeting, in addition to the report on the recent preparations by Qian Xinzhi, the chairman of the preparatory office, the representatives exchanged opinions on the lending method. The results of the discussion were: The lending object was decided to be fishermen, because fishermen are direct producers; (2) Improve the organization of fishermen, because Chinese fishermen do not yet have a sound organization, so after investigating the current organization and economic situation of fishermen, provide assistance; (3) Hope that the Ministry of Industry will pay attention to production and marketing and improve them to seek development, so that future lending will be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Establishment Next Spring</p>
<p>The official establishment date of the Fisheries Syndicate has been scheduled for the spring fish season next year.

Once the syndicate is established, it can be allocated. The preparatory office of the syndicate is actively conducting investigation work. In addition to preparing forms and sending them to various fishery agencies or groups to assist in collecting materials, it has also sent investigators Cao Erwei and others to the Shengsi Islands production area to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the economic, production, and various related actual conditions of fishermen to serve as a reference for future lending and the development of fisheries.</p>

<p>Totaling More Than Two Hundred Vessels</p>
<p>The Wusong River (commonly known as the Suzhou River) in Jiading County, from the east market of Huangdu Town to Jiwang Town, has been blocked by confiscated rice boats since the first day of this month.

<h3 id="e94">Yao Songnian Continues to Advocate Family One-Day Sports <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Hoping That National Families Will Unanimously Promote Aviation to Save the Country and Dedicate a Plane to Celebrate Longevity One-Day Sports. Since the Travel Industry Association Yao Songnian proposed it, it has been promoted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Purchase Plane Commemoration Meeting. Various agencies, groups, schools, and industries have enthusiastically supported it, and the results have been remarkable. Yao specifically took 10% of the one-day business income of the Shengtainan and Kang'er Hotels on Tianjin Road, totaling 23 yuan, 4 jiao, and 8 fen, and advocated family one-day sports, donating 2 yuan, all of which were handed over to the association for receipt. His patriotic enthusiasm and support for the leader are admirable. It is hoped that compatriots across the country will follow suit and also donate what each individual family needs for one day to jointly support the great cause. The original letter is excerpted as follows: Dear Sirs, I previously proposed to schedule the city's businesses to donate 10% of their business income for one day to be used for purchasing planes to save the country. It has been adopted and promoted by all sectors of society, and the effect has been quite significant, which is enough to make me feel gratified. However, after checking the reported donations for one-day sports, it only involves stores, agencies, groups, schools, etc. Unfortunately, it is still difficult to popularize it among individual families of our country, which is regrettable. In my opinion, the family is the cell of society, and the people are the cell of the family, gathering more and more people, and extending to the country. If we can promote family one-day sports, saving food for one day, from the owner to the servant, saving food for one day, and gathering funds to contribute to the country, saving the country and relieving the disaster is the duty of the people. I should shout loudly and promote family one-day sports, first changing the rice to noodles for one day in my family, saving the children's pocket money, and servants' wages, gathering 2 yuan of national currency to offer to the country as an advocate for families across the country. Although the amount is small, if families across the country follow suit and promote it without limit, it can also accumulate a tower of sand, living up to my little patriotic heart for saving the country. This is what I hope for. I hereby enclose the money with the letter. I hope you will review and approve it and promote it. I am extremely eager. This is to the Aviation Construction Association, Shanghai Branch.</p>

<p>The One Yuan Aid to Suiyuan Association of the Citizens' Federation of the First Special Zone sent two letters yesterday, saying: (1) The letter to the Citizens' Associations of the Second Special Zone, the South Shanghai District, and the North Shanghai District said, Dear Sirs, Our association believes that since bandits and puppet troops are invading the border, the soldiers at the front are fighting bloody battles against the enemy, and our people in the rear should also rise up to help and save the country together. Therefore, we have launched the "One Yuan Aid to Suiyuan Movement" in order to gather strength and enrich the defense. We have always admired your association's leadership of citizens' enthusiasm for saving the country, and you should have sympathy for this movement. Therefore, we send this letter to you and respectfully hope that you will give your advocacy to facilitate its promotion. (2) A letter to the members of the association said, Dear Sirs, According to the decision of the first executive committee meeting of the association, A.

<p>The Actual Situation of Improvement in the Past Year</p>
<p>The Situation in North China is Still Stable. Chen Juesheng, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, because of the funeral of the former ruling leader, which will be transported north, specially sent Zhao Weiru, the director of the bureau's office in Peiping, to Shanghai in advance to meet him. Zhao arrived in Shanghai by the Shanghai-Peiping train the day before yesterday morning and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. He went to the Xuhui district residence to offer condolences. According to him,</p>
<p>Beining Railway Affairs</p>
<p>Since Chen Juesheng took over as director, he has greatly rectified the bureau. He has made adjustments to all aspects of work, vehicles, machinery, police, and business. Therefore, dispatching and communication are more agile than before, and the service is excellent. The vehicle hygiene equipment is extremely complete, and passengers feel comfortable. He also recruited railway professionals to the improvement committee to conduct research. All improvement plans, and for the convenience of merchants and travelers, have set up business offices in Peiping and Tianjin to handle passenger transportation. The methods are the same as those of Shanghai travel agencies. Regarding inquiries, ticket sales, luggage pick-up, and hotel reservations, all can be handled properly and carefully, with simple procedures. Recently, an international lookout car has been set up, with luxurious and beautiful equipment. International travel ladies have praised it very much.</p>
<p>The Situation in North China</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in North China, since the Suiyuan War broke out, there have been rumors from time to time, mostly incited by traitors. The military and police authorities have been extremely strict in preventing them, and it is difficult for ordinary villains to succeed in their treachery. The situation in North China is stable, and the market is good. As for the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Chairman Song and Li Sihao, Chairman of the Economic Committee, have decided to proceed as appropriate under the principle of "equality and mutual benefit."</p>

<p>Seamen's Union Mediation, The China Merchants Bureau Stevedoring Office, due to the large number of unemployed members and the recent purchase of the Dashunkang ship to run on the Shanghai-Guangdong line, requested the Chinese Seamen's Union and the Shanghai Branch to negotiate arrangements. Yesterday, Qian Hongkun, a staff member of the Seamen's Branch, mediated between the two parties. As a result, the Bureau agreed to hire four people, and the union has sent four unemployed workers to serve on the ship. As for the rumor that the Dashunkang ship will run on the Shanghai-Yangtze River line, it is purely a misrepresentation.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Flour and Wheat Prices Continue to Rise. The Authorities Seek Stabilization Measures. Due to a Lack of Raw Materials, Factories Reduce Production One After Another. Sales of Flour and Wheat from Tianjin and Xi'an Increase Sharply. <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reports that since flour and wheat prices suddenly rose last Thursday, due to the surge in sales of flour from the Beiyang Gang and manipulation by speculators, market prices have continued to rise, and the price increase has not shown any signs of slowing down. Yesterday was a holiday, but the closing price last Friday was 4.065 yuan for flour expiring this month and 4.1575 yuan for flour expiring in April. The price of wheat expiring this month was 6.54 yuan, the price for wheat expiring in the future was 6.98 yuan, and the price of wheat from Zhongguan had opened at 6.65 yuan. The Tianjin Gang is purchasing nearly 100,000 bags of spot flour, and the number of spot wheat purchased from Xi'an is also very large. Judging from the current situation, it will be difficult to return to a low price when the market opens today.</p>
<p>Striving to Remedy and Stabilize Market Prices</p>
<p>Since the unprecedented surge in flour and wheat prices, the exchange authorities, in order to seek remedies to stabilize market prices, specially solicited opinions from all parties through the board of directors and formulated four measures, announced to both buyers and sellers, and organized an appraisal committee to identify various commodities. The association is scheduled to be established at 2 pm today. The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, since the exchange and the brokers' association requested the cancellation of the price limit, and the recent rise in prices is related to the people's livelihood, is now sending staff to the market to conduct investigations to understand the actual situation before handling it.</p>
<p>Flour Mills Reduce Production One After Another</p>
<p>According to Rong Zongjing, a major figure in the flour industry, speaking to a Da Gong News Agency reporter, although there was a good harvest in various parts of the country this year, it is estimated that the Japanese have purchased more than 300,000 dan of domestic wheat. Therefore, the market price has risen accordingly. Farmers and banks that have pledged wheat have hoarded a large amount, resulting in a shortage of spot wheat on the market. Although factories have set up stalls to collect wheat, the number is small. Therefore, manufacturers have reduced the number of vehicles one after another due to insufficient raw materials for flour production. In Shanghai, the number of vehicles in operation is less than 50%. Foreign wheat prices are high and cannot be ordered. The number of flour in factories' warehouses and pledged as collateral is also very limited.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Wheat Boats are Detained Midway</p>
<p>When the Jiwang Temple Police Station of the Jiading County Public Security Bureau detained rice boats in the Wusong River, there were initially eight or nine wheat boats, each with four or five tons, that were also detained. In the past few days, the number of boats passing through has accumulated to more than 20 vessels, and they have not yet been released. Moreover, the wheat was purchased by Shanghai's Shenxin, Fuxin, Xinda, and other factories in the interior.

<h3 id="e103">The Tenants Association Sent a Letter to the Real Estate Association, Urging Landlords to Voluntarily Reduce Rents to Lighten Tenants' Burdens and Seek Coexistence and Co-prosperity <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Tenants Association of this city believes that although the issue of rent reduction in this city has been repeatedly called for by all parties, requesting the authorities to specify standards, it has not been realized for various reasons. As the end of the year is approaching, various industries are facing even more difficulties. In order to stabilize society, the association sent a letter to the Real Estate Association of this city yesterday, informing the owners to quickly announce a voluntary rent reduction. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern, the issue of rent reduction in this city has been called for for a long time and has been deadlocked for two years, but the landlords are sticking to their prejudices and have not yet resolved it. In order to achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity, our association has decided through a general meeting to persuade landlords to voluntarily reduce rents by 40% in order to achieve social recovery. We believe that since the January 28th Incident, the commercial situation in Shanghai has become increasingly depressed, and there are daily reports of forced business closures. The reason is that the burden of rent accounts for 50-60% of other expenses. Therefore, the so-called prosperous Shanghai of the past is now filled with empty houses and no one inquires about them. However, the landlords still collect rent from the second landlords on a monthly basis. If they are unable to pay, they resort to legal action. It is important to know that in order for the second landlords to not default on rent, the rent must first be reduced. Then, subletting will be easy and the burden will be lighter, and there will be no more worries about default. Our association has observed this situation, and for the sake of both parties' interests, we hereby request your association to quickly advise the landlords in various places to consider the actual situation and uniformly reduce rents to maintain mutual feelings and make plans for coexistence and co-prosperity. If it is not necessary, we will definitely ask for your understanding. This matter concerns the entire society, and we hope you will adopt it. We are extremely hopeful."</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Fifth Phase of Shanghai County Tobacco Licenses Has Ended <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>A total of 423 licenses re-issued Shanghai County's fifth phase of tobacco user licenses began to be reissued on October, and a method of phased reduction of fees was stipulated. It expired at the end of last month. It is now found that among the tobacco users who exchanged licenses within each time limit, 232 licenses were exchanged in the first time limit, 56 in the second, 21 in the third, 11 in the fourth, and 3 in the fifth, for a total of 323. During the license exchange period, 64 people quit smoking, and 20 people were found to have moved or died due to illness, etc. It is estimated that more than 80% have been reached. Yesterday, County Magistrate Li prepared a document to report the completion situation to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs for record. On the other hand, the head of the Anti-Smoking Section, Shen Jiaqi, prepared a statistical table and submitted the license fees separately.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Xu Wancheng's Situation is Pitiful <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>His wife died of illness and his bookstore was sealed. Xu Wancheng, a native of Jinshan and the owner of the Longwen Bookstore at the entrance of Baiyang Third Lane, Zhonghua Road, Dananmen, was once detained by the court for more than two months due to the publication of "Xu Wancheng's Work Report Special Issue," which contained an article titled "Investigation of the Dark Secrets of the Chinese Judiciary," which slandered the former President of the Local Court, Luo Tong, and Judge Zhao, etc., for accepting bribes. Later, the High Court transferred jurisdiction to the Wuxian Local Court, which sentenced him to a fine of 30 yuan and announced a reprieve. After the Xu lawsuit was resolved, he filed an appeal on the one hand, and on the other hand, he also accused Luo Tong and Judge Fu Hongze and Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, etc., of improper detention, which was also handed over to the Wuxian Local Court by the High Court for trial. Just as he was about to show his talent, bad luck came one after another. His wife recently died of illness. Moreover, the house where Xu Wancheng rented and opened the Longwen Bookstore was sued by the landlord Luo Yaqing for owing 480 yuan in rent during the period when Xu Wancheng was involved in the lawsuit. After the judgment was confirmed, the Local Court ordered the bailiffs to go to the Longwen Bookstore to execute all the business assets and seal the store on the previous day. Xu Wancheng's situation can truly be described as family ruin and death.</p>
<h3 id="e106">A Kidnapping Case Was Cracked at the Osaka Wharf, and Three Children Were Rescued <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The five-year-old boys Gengen and Linlin, sons of Yao Jin Shi and Yao Bu Shi, women from Pudong at No. 14 Yanhai Road, Huajie, and the six-year-old boy Jusheng, son of Cai Xing, a native of Ningbo at No. 3 Fangbang Road, went missing while playing at the door between the 20th and 25th of last month. The Public Security Bureau reported the case and arrested the kidnappers. There were no clues to be found. Until about 2 p.m. on the 26th, Feng Shaoshan, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Station, discovered two Ningbo women, Wang Li Shi and Chen Ye Shi, on the Japanese ship Shengjing Maru at the Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu. They were planning to send the three children to Fujian to sell them for profit. They were brought to the police station together. Later, a fellow gang member, Zhu Shunchang from Zhenjiang, was found at Wang Li Shi's house at No. 5, Lane 70, Caishi Road, in the French Concession. He was also escorted to the First Special District Court for detention and sent to the Public Security Bureau for transfer. All three children were taken back by their families. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xie Fen questioned the three defendants in the third criminal court, and since the Public Security Bureau still did not send Chang to court, it was decided to transfer the three defendants to the Shanghai Local Court for review.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Lawyers Association Collects Clothes and Bedding for Prisoners. The Weather is Severe and Prisoners are Crying Out. Kind People Should Donate. <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association believes that the number of detainees in the Jiangsu High Court Detention Center, the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court Prison, and the Jiangsu Second Prison is large. Recently, due to the severe weather, they cry out and weep at night because they lack prisoners' clothes and bedding. The prison wardens of these prisons sent letters to the association a few days ago, requesting donations of clothes and bedding so that each prisoner could keep warm, etc. The association submitted it to the Executive Committee for discussion and decided to notify all its members to enthusiastically donate clothes and bedding within two weeks, which would be collected and transferred to the prisons for distribution to the prisoners to keep warm, etc. The association notified all members yesterday to generously donate clothes and bedding and send them to the association for transfer within two weeks. Then, public morality will be immeasurable.</p>

<p>Huang Yongkang, a native of Changshu, 18 years old, an optician, and resident of No. 407 Zhaojiabang Road, married Hong Yuanyuan (19 years old), a local woman, in January of last year. After the marriage, they were still harmonious. Before long, it became clear that she was involved in extramarital affairs, and her husband could not keep an eye on her because of his business. Recently, he heard that she was having an affair with Lin Hongjie (29 years old), a local man who worked in a rice shop. Huang entrusted his friend Feng Yonghai to tail her. Sure enough, the previous night, he saw Lin Hongjie and Hong attending a movie at the Zhejiang Grand Theater. They followed them to the Central Hotel in Xiaodongmen, and then reported to Huang Yongkang to catch them in the act. They were caught naked and brought to the Yimiao Police Station by the police for investigation. After interrogation, it was found that the case involved adultery, and they were ordered to be sent to the General Bureau for review.</p>

<p>Since a brief snow flurry the night before last, the weather in this port was even more severe yesterday morning. The north wind was blowing frequently, and it was extremely cold. Water storage appliances were frozen into thin layers, as were ditches. Moreover, the sunlight was sometimes visible and sometimes hidden, and the weather was uncertain. The French and Chinese Water Company, in view of the fact that the weather has entered the deep winter, reminded residents to pay attention to the anti-freeze measures for their water taps and meters. Dry grass should be used to wrap them to prevent them from freezing and cracking or being blocked by ice.</p>

However, the deep waterway light buoys will be replaced by a wooden marker with a suspended spherical mark on the side of the abandoned river dike. The names of the above-mentioned original lightships, buoys, etc. are listed below: (1) Dagu Lightship, (2) Dagu Import Light Buoy, (3) Dagu Sand Tail Buoy, (4) Waterway Test Guide Buoy, (5) Deep Waterway Light Buoy, (6) Gulanjiang Sand Lightship,</p>

<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, mortgaged the four wharves to the China Business Company during his tenure and embezzled more than 700,000 taels of public funds and bribed Chen Fumu, the former director of the company. After three trials, Li was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment with a suspended sentence. The principal and interest of his private lawsuit have reached more than 1.2 million yuan. During the execution hearing, Li Guojie was released on bail by Chu Qiqing and Li Sihao, but they have not yet paid. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also offered a reward to find Li's property, but only a small portion, less than one-tenth, has been found. They have repeatedly urged the lawsuit and requested that Li Guojie be declared bankrupt by official authority. Li's side stated that he has a considerable position in society and expressed his unwillingness to be executed. Judge Yu Lude ordered Li to provide property within half a month, but at the deadline, Li requested an extension due to illness. The plaintiff's attorney requested strict enforcement in court. The judge ruled that he would summon the guarantors for questioning and then review the matter. The execution court of the Local Court has scheduled a hearing today to question the matter.</p>

Those present included Chuan Bolang, Zhang Meisun, Tan Chuantuan, Kang Zhuying, Liang Wanli, Song Qiqin, Shi Wenbin, Yan Keding, etc., who unanimously elected Yan Keding as chairman and Chuan Bolang as secretary. First, it was reported that the number of participating members had reached one hundred, with members from Anhui, Hankou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanchang, Wuxi, Changshu, and other places participating. The following resolutions were discussed: (1) In order to encourage more enthusiastic participation from artists throughout the city, the establishment was postponed. (2) To expand the recruitment of members, Yan Keding was nominated to draft a letter to artists throughout the city. (3) To first establish a temporary editorial committee to actively compile national defense paintings, music, and craft teaching materials, and Zhang Meisun, Shi Chongpeng, Chuan Bolang, and nineteen others were nominated as members. (4) It was decided to stage a drama performance early next year, organize a performance committee, and Yan Keding, He Kangli, and five others were nominated as members, with Wu Keding concurrently serving as general affairs and He Kangli as stage manager. The script has been decided as "Our Homeland I," directed by the author Zhang Min et al. (5) To hold an exhibition and meeting on air defense, poison gas defense, and bandit suppression paintings, and Liang Xiaohong, Xiong Zuolin, and eleven others were nominated as preparatory members. (6) To prepare a special radio station to broadcast national defense songs, and Kang Zhuying and eleven others were nominated as preparatory members, and after contact with the city's Mutual Aid Society, it was initially decided that the broadcast material would be "Anti-Enemy Song," etc. Mr. Chuan Bolang of the society has compiled a method for manufacturing gas masks, which can be obtained by sending a letter with ten cents in postage to the address (published by the Zhonghua Art Company on Penglai Road). Kang Zhuying and others have already begun compiling multiple volumes of national defense song collections, which will be published soon. Now, we will explore and adopt the society's enlarged solicitation of members, as stated in its letter to art educators in the city, as follows:</p>
<p>Since the National Defense Art Society was permitted to organize by Party and government organs, it has been actively preparing with the support of all parties, and the society's affairs are progressing daily. Many art teachers in the city have participated enthusiastically, but there are still many who have not. Considering the reason, it is because the purpose and objectives of the society have not been understood by all. Therefore, we will restate several points as follows: First, to enhance national awareness. Art is the expression of human life, and the nation is the sum of human collective life. At this time of imminent danger for China, the collective life of the Chinese nation may be destroyed. If we want to ensure the continuation and development of this collective life, we should actively utilize the effectiveness of art to enhance national awareness. This is the first point. Second, to promote national spirit. Art is the expression of the human spirit, and the nation is the highest form of human life. Chinese people's lives have always been decadent, scattered, narrow, disorganized. If we want to make the Chinese nation develop upward, we must actively utilize the effectiveness of art to promote the national spirit. This is the second point. Third, to build national strength. Art has the creation of human strength, and the nation is the result of the creation of human strength. Due to internal geographic relations, the lives of Chinese people have always been conservative and biased towards regional concepts, unable to create a collective national strength. If we want to resist national demise and make the Chinese nation forever prosperous and sustainable, we must actively utilize the effectiveness of art to build national strength. This is the third point. The above three points are the greatest purposes and objectives of the society's organization. We hope that art educators in the city will not hesitate to offer corrections and look forward to their enthusiastic participation to discuss and carry out these three tasks. All comrades, why not come?</p>

<p>Recently, prices of various commodities in this city have been rising, with paper being the most significant. In the past half-month, the price of newsprint has risen from 3.30 or 3.40 yuan per ream to 4.40 or 4.50 yuan, an increase of more than one yuan. Furthermore, due to the soaring prices of raw materials in the steel and hardware industry, the cost of manufacturing machinery has increased accordingly. After deliberation by the executive committee, it was decided that, starting immediately, the prices of all kinds of machinery will be increased by 20% based on the original prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported that near the end of the year, when finances are tight, suddenly obtaining unexpected wealth brings great joy. Two waitresses at a certain coffee shop in Hongkou received small tips of five jiao each from customers at the end of last month. The two pooled together one yuan and bought an aviation lottery ticket, which they left in a drawer. After the lottery draw on the 4th of this month, they remembered the number they bought and found that they had won second prize, each receiving 1,500 yuan. This can truly be called a stroke of good luck.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Third Meeting of Tung-Yih Creditors <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Electing Nine Supervisors, Central News Agency reports that after Tung-Yih Trust Company was declared bankrupt, two meetings of creditors were called to elect supervisors to oversee the bankruptcy proceedings. However, due to the lack of a legal quorum, both meetings were adjourned. Yesterday was the date for the third meeting. Because Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, and others came forward to prepare for a settlement and resumption of business, the creditors were very excited and attended enthusiastically. At the scheduled meeting time, the Lake Society Auditorium was already full, with 800 people present representing 800,000 yuan in debt, sufficient for a legal quorum. The meeting was opened at 3 PM by Judge Wang Gongliang of the First Special District Court, who also presided over it. First, the bankruptcy administrator, accountant Li Ding, reported on the audit process and the preliminary payment of 25% of savings deposits. Then, a public election of five supervisors was held. Ma Qichang, Gu Dier, Dong Yu, and Xing Minyi were nominated as vote counters, and Zhang Yifan, Wu Daokun, and others were nominated as ballot readers. The results of the voting showed that the most votes were received by Ma Qichang, Yin Yucheng, Yu Zhongluo, Le Junwei, etc. As for the resumption of business, after a representative of the board of directors, Xu Shisong, reported on the coordination plan, the creditors did not agree with the empty talk of resumption and required the raising of new shares. Therefore, although this matter was proposed for discussion, it must be decided by voting. However, since less than three-quarters of the attendees were present, it must be decided by postal voting. The meeting adjourned late in the evening.</p>
<h3 id="e117">New Drug Industry Requests Purchase of Sealed Narcotics <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of New Drug Associations submitted a request to the Ministry of Health yesterday, stating that the request is to purchase the narcotic drugs sealed nationwide at a price to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. It is hoped that it will be reviewed and approved. It is humbly believed that the "Provisional Measures for Purchasing and Using Narcotic Drugs" stipulates that morphine and up to ten other types can be purchased and used. However, there are no clear regulations on how to deal with the other types. However, before the promulgation of these measures, member businesses still had unsold inventory of the other ten types. If they continue to be used, it would violate the law. If they are simply destroyed, significant capital would be at stake. Since the law does not apply retroactively, this type of inventory was purchased legally before the promulgation of the regulations for legitimate use. If it is not properly disposed of, it seems unfair in terms of both sentiment and reason. Therefore, the member association submitted a request to your department, requesting permission to sell out the inventory to provide relief. It was humbly approved on January 29th, Medical Document No. 426, stating that the request has been noted, and the merchants should be notified to quickly list the types and quantities of their inventory and report them for further review. This approval was followed by Medical Document No. 3974 on July 16th, stating that the request has been noted and continued inquiries should be made to expedite the reporting. Because of this, the member association has repeatedly urged all member businesses to quickly report and has repeatedly reported to your department for record. However, there have been no instructions on how to handle this inventory. Now, the second National Congress of Member Representatives has raised the issue for discussion. All agreed that the inventory is a matter of significant capital, and prolonged sealing will have a negative impact. Therefore, it was resolved to appeal to your department to observe the difficulties of the people and approve the purchase of the narcotic drugs sealed nationwide at a price to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, which would be a great kindness.</p>

After amending Article 11 of the constitution, changing the number of executive committee members to 11 and the number of supervisory committee members to 5, the election of vacant committee members was held. The results of the ballot count showed that Chen Xingsun, Wei Zhiqi, Shen Yunde, and Xu Shangwen were elected as executive committee members. Subsequently, industry regulations were discussed and revised one by one. However, the price section of the industry regulations was considered a major issue. The meeting decided to form an appraisal committee to handle it. In addition to the executive and supervisory committee members of the guild serving as ex officio members, the executive committee will also appoint five additional members from the guild to jointly form the committee. The scope of the appraisal should separately define the "book edition" and "parts."

<h3 id="e122">Jiang Yao Xianhui Lectures on Married Life Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Three Points to Note in Married Life, Mutual Understanding Can Reduce Misunderstandings</p>
<p>Ms. Jiang Yao Xianhui, former director of the Student Department of the Young Women's Christian Association, gave a detailed lecture on "Married Life and Spiritual Cultivation" at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 4 PM yesterday. Ms. Jiang said that in the past, Chinese women's married life emphasized self-cultivation, such as the "Three Obediences and Four Virtues" of the old etiquette. Therefore, women in large families only had obedience and patience. Today, with the progress of the times and the influence of European and American freedom, young men and women have abandoned large family life and organized small families, and advocate spousal autonomy. With reasonable marriage freedom, small family life is bound to be harmonious. However, married life cannot be entirely satisfactory. We can make up for this shortcoming only by paying attention to spiritual cultivation. However, this kind of cultivation should be different from the passive obedience and "patience" of the past, and pay attention to (1) mutual understanding, (2) appreciative attitude, (3) playful attitude. Because mutual understanding can reduce misunderstandings, paying attention to an appreciative attitude can enable both parties to understand each other's strengths, and a playful life can dissolve serious family problems and achieve harmony.</p>

Because the road was narrow, the Route 10 bus was close to the tram tracks, causing the trailer of the tram to collide with the bus. There was a loud crash, and the bus window shattered immediately. Fortunately, there were not many passengers, and they knew to avoid the impact, so no one was injured. Chinese and Western police officers arrived, recorded the numbers of both drivers, and briefly halted traffic. Traffic then resumed.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Boatman Attempts to Sell Stolen Gasoline <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Scheme Unsuccessful, Arrested</p>
<p>Liu San, 44 years old from Taizhou, used to work as a boatman. Recently, he learned that Wuxi Huacheng Company and Yixing Yushun Company purchased eighty barrels of gasoline each from Texaco in this city, totaling 9,600 yuan at 60 yuan per barrel. They entrusted Xue Youji Transportation Company at Xinmatou, Nanshi, to transport it. Liu had a sudden idea and colluded with unemployed boatmen Wang Zhenlong, Cai Douyou, and Ming Fu to steal a No. 8272 pier boat belonging to an unknown boatman. Liu pretended to be the boat owner and solicited the business from Mei Jinhua, a broker at Xue Youji, to transport the gasoline to Guanxi. The freight he quoted was very low. Mei did not know Liu and dared not trust him. Liu then incited Pu Jinbao and Bing Xiaonan to act as guarantors, and they finally agreed on a deal. On the 2nd of this month, Liu loaded 160 barrels of gasoline onto the boat and left Shanghai. Liu believed his opportunity had arrived, and Yan Juhong facilitated the sale of the large quantity of gasoline to Liu and Shen Quansheng, who specialized in small goods. Just as they were negotiating the price, Xue Youji became anxious because the goods had not arrived at their destination. Jiang Gensheng, a broker at Zhengtai Transportation Company, learned of the matter and confronted Liu in Shanghai. Liu did not reveal anything, but Jiang quietly learned of their whereabouts and quickly reported to Mei Jinhua, requesting the customs water police to investigate. After receiving the report, the police sent detectives Hu Changqing and Jin Guifu to arrest Liu, who confessed to fraudulently transporting the gasoline with the intention of selling it. The stolen goods had not yet been unloaded, and the boat was moored near Qiwu Road, Yangshupu. The detectives then recovered all the stolen goods and summoned the original guarantors Pu and Bing for questioning. Based on Liu's confession, they also went to Room 22 of the Sanjiang Inn on North Hai Road at 5:30 AM yesterday and arrested another accomplice, Cai Douyou. They were detained to continue the arrest of the remaining fugitives and handle the case.</p>

<p>Jin Zhiqing (40 years old, from Changshu), an employee of the Shanghai Chinese Cloth Exchange on Avenue Edward VII, left the exchange at noon on the 1st of this month and took a chartered car back to his residence at No. 10 Rue des Soeurs when, while the car was passing by the Central Bank of China, a rogue named Tu Jinlang from Jiangxi suddenly rushed out from the side of the road, stopped Jin's chartered car, and threw the dung contained in a paper bag in his hand onto Jin's head and face, causing Jin's mouth and nose to be covered in dirt, and his clothes and hat to be dripping with filth and unbearable stench. Jin got out of the car and chased after him, shouting loudly, and was caught by the police, who took him to the police station and sent him to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. The investigation of the circumstances has been recorded in this newspaper. The presiding judge, Zhang Minsheng, conducted a preliminary hearing in the Eighth Criminal Division the previous morning. The police attorney Chen Ming and the police station investigated the case and filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. Then, the plaintiff testified about the situation of being dirtied. The defendant confessed that the plaintiff's chartered car had torn his clothes, and he had asked for compensation but was refused, so he held a grudge and threw the dung. The court verified the confession and sentenced Tu Jinlang to fifty days of detention for damaging the property of others, as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Fresh Pork Vendors Association's Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Fresh Pork Vendors Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Respectfully informing you that we have received a joint letter from 34 vendors, including Xu Zhongliu of Nantong County, Sang Lixuan, Qin Guojun and Cong Yixing of Rugao County, Zhang Yiyuan and Sha Wenxuan of Dongtai County, etc., stating that the Jiangbei pork business tax violates provincial orders by arbitrarily establishing tax checkpoints, abusing power, and harming the people. We urge you to forward this to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, who will then forward it to the Executive Yuan, to retrieve and review the full files of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance and the detailed original documents from the Nantong Administrative Inspector Commissioner, to gather witnesses from both sides, and to investigate and punish fairly according to the law. Furthermore, reserve the right to recover losses and damages to deter corruption and maintain provincial governance. The establishment of the Jiangbei pork business tax is based on the practice of Anhui Province, where the industry association collects taxes on behalf of the government. Collection points are set up at various river ports, as these are where pork businesses congregate, thus the regulation of industry association collection avoids taxing goods directly, preventing conflict with the gold tax abolition case. It also prevents tax collectors from harassing merchants and causing undue difficulties. However, the business tax commissioner Chen Gao and the contractors Bao Shang and Tang, have set up nine checkpoints in the Dingyan, Baipu, Liqiao, Maqiao, and Matang areas at the Tong-Rugao border, intercepting ships along the river to collect taxes on pork. Some of these, such as the five Yu checkpoints, were not even established during the Likin era, or were set up during the Likin surplus era but were later abolished by order of the provincial government after being reported as illegal. The business tax bureau has recently re-established them all, ignoring repeated complaints. Here are the specific violations and harms caused by the unauthorized establishment of five checkpoints to intercept ships for tax collection: (1) It violates the original plan to abolish Likin and add taxes, taxing goods. (2) It violates the original provincial order that industry associations collect taxes on behalf of the government, setting up checkpoints in inland river areas where there are no industry associations. (3) It re-establishes checkpoints at places that were already ordered to be abolished, such as the Liao Yan and Matang, and sets up new checkpoints without approval, such as Liqiao and Maqiao, defying laws, harming the country, and harming the people. (4) Within the same tax collection area, Jingjiang, Rugao, and Nantong have different methods and vastly different tax rates, disrupting the business of our Nantong people, merchants, rickshaw pullers, and boatmen, making it impossible to maintain a livelihood. (5) Because they have privately added five checkpoints to intercept taxes mid-river, merchants from Dongtai and Rugao exporting pork from Nantong are subjected to economic pressure, have difficulty in turnover, business shrinks, time is extended, prices are devalued and sold cheaply, and there are various losses such as death and damage. The first three items are violations of national law and defiance of provincial orders by the business tax bureau, while the latter two items are the destruction of the business of merchants and the livelihoods of farmers, rickshaw pullers, and boatmen. Based on these facts, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, along with transport merchants Yin Hegao and Zhang Yiyuan, have appealed one after another, but the tax bureau, relying on backing, has delayed until now and refuses to abolish the checkpoints. Recently, they have become even more unscrupulous in exploiting the people. Zhongliu and others have petitioned the Nantong Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office, requesting a thorough investigation and relief according to the law. It has also been verified that the business tax bureau collects taxes on behalf of the industry association at Xingang and other places, assesses the value of goods at Xinshenggang and other places, and sets up checkpoints on ships in the middle of inland rivers in Nantong to assess and collect taxes, which is actually a method of collecting taxes on individual pigs (with attached documents). The methods of collection are inconsistent, which is indeed the case. As for the disparity in tax rates and other malpractices, they have not yet been investigated, but even just the point of setting up checkpoints in inland rivers and inconsistent collection methods is enough to show that there is indeed harassment of merchants. Furthermore, according to the Ministry of Finance's document No. 4752, the provincial government has already prohibited the establishment of checkpoints in inland rivers. Therefore, the business tax bureau should follow the original plan and unify the collection methods to avoid criticism. From a legal standpoint, this case should be forwarded to the provincial government for review. All of these cases show that the bureau's lawlessness and harm to the people are as clear as day. However, several months have passed, and the bureau has not yet abolished the checkpoints in inland rivers, nor has it followed the original plan of collection by industry associations as stipulated by the provincial government, despite repeated orders from the provincial government. It seems that the pork business tax bureau, as a legally established national institution, should be based on national laws and be subject to the command of the provincial government, rather than being allowed to defy laws and orders and trample on the people. Its arrogance and audacity to abuse power and harm the people, and the appeals and official documents that fill the desks, have not been straightened out, leaving us common people with no law to rely on and at their mercy. Now, we are preparing the reasons, attaching supporting documents and diagrams, and sending this letter to your association, according to the original letter, to forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, who will then forward it to the Executive Yuan for review. We hope that you will consider the plight of the merchants, provide prompt relief, and in the spirit of filial piety, unleash the power of thunder, and immediately order the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to retrieve and review all relevant documents regarding the establishment of the business tax bureau, the full file of the people's organization's complaints against the bureau's violations, and the detailed original request from the Nantong Administrative Inspector Commissioner, and to gather witnesses from both sides for questioning as soon as possible to alleviate their suffering. As for the damages suffered by various industries in Tongfang due to the bureau's violations, please order them to be reserved and separately pursued for compensation, and report them together. This would be a great act of kindness, and we are extremely grateful." It is permissible to investigate the truth. Check the attached map of the exit from the river, and there are as many as 20 locations. It is true that corvée is frightening to hear. The rescue team has repeatedly requested assistance from the meeting. The meeting sent a letter to the council to call for assistance, but the local government of Jiangsu Province did not thoroughly investigate and punish the spirit of party rule. Since the abolition of the levy card for several years, the merchants' suffering has not been relieved. Back to the people, the national abolition of the levy card was completed in the year of the revolution. Since then, the province has been closely linked to the capital, and it is a strange thing to violate the national laws and decrees. This kind of corruption and abuse of power is a national curse. With the approval of the letter, a copy of the map of the Jiangbei pig's export from the river is attached, and two photos are sent to your society, and a letter is sent to the Executive Yuan to investigate the greed and evils in accordance with the law, and to maintain the imperative urgency.</p>

<p>On the evening of May 27th last year at 9:45 PM, the home of Zhang Juyang, a Siyang native residing at 70 Yangshupu Road, was invaded by several armed bandits, who robbed property worth 549 yuan, fled, and opened fire, fatally wounding their accomplice Chen Buzhao, and wounding Zhang and his friend Shi Jinzhu. After being apprehended by the police, the perpetrators Ma Jinbiao, Wang Jinsheng, Wang Fu, and others were sent to the First Special District Court and sentenced to various prison terms. They confessed that the middleman was a person named "Little Pipe" who was at large and could not be found. On the morning of October 20th of this year, the Chinese and foreign detectives of the Yangshupu Police Station received a tip from an informant that "Little Pipe" was Gao Hongbang from Haizhou, hiding in a bungalow on Haizhou Road. They secretly arrested him and sent him to court for repeated trials, but he did not admit to the crime. However, the settled perpetrators Ma Jinbiao et al. identified him in their proposals, all saying that "Little Pipe" was not the defendant. Gao said that he was in Nanjing at the time, staying with a friend of Li Jihai at Longwang Temple, for a month. For the sake of caution, the court sent a letter to the Capital District Court to verify the facts, which confirmed his alibi. The defendant hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. The ruling was heard. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Qing of the Criminal Division 3 ruled Gao Hongbang not guilty and released him.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Overview of Changes in Shanghai Industry and Commerce in September 1936 (Continued) <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit</p>
<p>(Shanghai Industry and Commerce Overview, No. 39)</p>
<p>(6) Li Maochang Machine Copper and Iron Bed Factory Liquidates and Sells: The factory was established around 1918-1919, sixteen or seventeen years ago. The registered capital was seven or eight thousand yuan. It was founded solely by Mr. Li Liancai and employed fifteen or sixteen workers. The total value of machinery and equipment was over three thousand yuan. Since its opening, the initial scope was small. After Mr. Li's painstaking management, the foundation gradually stabilized. The sales of its products were mainly to hotels in the Beijing area. In recent years, it has been affected by the economic downturn externally and competition from peers internally, resulting in a decline in business, difficult turnover, and heavy losses, forcing it to liquidate and sell.</p>
<p>(7) China Lead Wire Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Established: The company was initiated by Mr. Chen Jingtang and Mr. Zhang Songshan. The annual demand for lead wire in China is huge, but no one in the country has set up a factory to manufacture it, relying on imports from abroad every year. Therefore, Mr. Chen and others, in order to promote production and prevent leakage, joined forces with like-minded people to establish China Lead Wire Manufacturing Co., Ltd. to manufacture in Shanghai. All shares have been subscribed by the founders separately, and a shareholders' meeting was formally established on the 10th of this month, electing Jiang Yiping, Chen Jingtang, Fang Yixian, Zhang Songshan, Zhu Rushan, Dai Gengxin, and Zhang Liling as directors, and Shao Jingfu and Xiang Meiying as supervisors.</p>
<p>In the sales and commercial category this month, the number of new businesses increased slightly compared to last month, while the number of closures increased by twenty compared to last month, and the situation seems to have deteriorated again. The main reason for this is the decline of the cotton cloth, Western clothing, and department store industries. The more important changes are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Hongchang Cloth Shop Temporarily Ceases Business: The shop was founded in 1932 and has been in operation for over four years. The manager is Mr. Zheng Xiaozhong. Business has been fairly successful on weekdays, and there have been surpluses in recent years. Recently, due to differences of opinion among shareholders, there have been many twists and turns. The disputes between the manager and shareholders are serious, making it impossible to continue the business, forcing it to temporarily cease operations. The outside world is very sorry for this.</p>
<p>(2) Weida Silk and Satin Store Opens: The store was initiated by silk industry magnates Liu Mingjia, Yu Zhongfei, and Shen Disheng and started preparations in the spring of this year. They leased the shop base at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road and rebuilt the facade themselves. The work was completed last month. After active arrangements, it opened on the 20th of this month. Internally, it is divided into silk and satin, new clothing, trims, suiting materials, wholesale, mail order, and gift certificate departments. The scale is grand and the equipment is novel, making it a rising star in the silk industry.</p>
<p>(3) Tongkangxiang Foreign Goods and Cotton Cloth Shop Temporarily Ceases Business: The shop has been open for many years and has a large scope. It is organized as a partnership, with shareholder Mr. Xu Fengyi concurrently serving as manager. The capital is strong, and it has a reputation in the industry. Business has also been fairly successful on weekdays. Unexpectedly, there was a sudden internal organizational relationship recently, forcing it to cease business and liquidate. The responsible persons left separately, causing great panic among the creditors. It is heard that a creditors' group has been organized to negotiate.</p>
<p>(4) Zhendachang Yarn and Thread Shop Opens: The shop was founded jointly by yarn industry figures Gu Xikun, Shao Huikang, Wu Mulian, and others. The scale is grand, and the capital is strong. It specializes in Chinese and foreign cotton yarn, various coarse and fine threads, cotton silk, wool, cashmere, etc., as well as various raw materials for cotton mills and knitting factories, and refined mercerized dyeing. It opened on the 3rd of this month.</p>
<p>(5) Yuanfengrun Incense and Candle Shop Closes: The shop was founded solely by Mr. Zhang Geyuan and is a giant in the candle industry. Its high reputation and long history are well known to people in Shanghai. It is heard that it has been open for over twenty years, and with proper management, there have been annual surpluses. Branch stores have been set up in Hangzhou and Putuo, further strengthening its position. Outside deposits have been increasing steadily. Mr. Zhang used the surplus funds to set up the Tiandetang Pharmacy and an inland shipping company, but both failed, resulting in heavy losses. Mr. Zhang was greatly weakened by this blow. Although the candle shop still has a surplus, it is a drop in the bucket. The debt is accumulating, and the economic turnover is difficult. The creditors have filed lawsuits in court one after another, and the court has executed a seizure. Although Mr. Zhang tried his best to communicate with the creditors and suggested transferring the debt into shares in order to revive the business, it was ultimately impossible to recover due to the creditors' tough attitude. As a result, this once-renowned candle shop painfully closed down.</p>
<p>(6) Zhonghua National Goods Company Opens: The company was founded by industrialists Zhou Beilin and Zhou Jingkang, with a registered capital of 200,000 yuan in national currency. Internally, it is divided into silk and satin, leather shoes, knitwear, cotton textiles, and hat departments. Some spaces are rented to other operators. The scale is quite large, and it is a strong force in the national goods industry.</p>
<p>(7) Beifu Foreign Goods Store Opens: The store is a large-scale shopping mall established by Japanese merchants, specializing in silk, cotton, and wool fabrics, cosmetics, toys, stationery, and other items. It opened on the 2nd of this month. It is said that the company plans to set up branches in Hongkou and other important areas in due course.</p>
<p>(8) Cheap Shopping Mall Closes: The shopping mall only opened on March 10th of this year and has suddenly announced a temporary cessation of business after only half a year. It is heard that the shopping mall was originally founded by a coalition of national goods manufacturers, and its nature was not a permanent organization. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e151">With Feng Scoring Two Penalty Kicks, Tung Wah Fortunately Defeats Western Police; Western Police Once Led 4-2 and Was Celebrated for a Time; Unfortunately, Two Own Goals and Two Penalty Kicks Reversed the Situation, Allowing Tung Wah to Achieve a Final Victory of 6-4. <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Tung Wah and Western Police met yesterday in the second week of the Scotto Cup competition at the Recreation Ground. The scene was quite crowded. Tung Wah played cautiously, and Western Police showed no weakness either. In the first half, they even took a 3-2 lead, making the entire audience feel nervous. Fortunately, Tung Wah was more skilled and ultimately eliminated Western Police with a score of 6-4, securing a spot in the semi-finals. Currently, in the Scotto Cup semi-final week, the French Business and Lax teams have already been decided. Yesterday, Lao Yi Er also eliminated Western Business with a score of 3-2, advancing with Tung Wah, still forming the top four powerhouses in the league. This truly adheres to the law of survival of the fittest. Let's see who will ultimately hold the reins this year. The starting lineups for both sides yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah Association</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Zhuang Youren, Li Yichen</p>
<p>Gu Shangrang, Feng Yunyou, Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Wanxianghua, Luo Haiguang, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Western Police Team</p>
<p>Mei En</p>
<p>Turner, Douglas</p>
<p>Han Lai, Ga Xu, Hui Sihe</p>
<p>Wei Li, Te Fei, Jack, Pei Te, Ao Ke Lai</p>
<p>Turner's Own Goal Allows Tung Wah to Score First</p>
<p>The two teams faced off. Tung Wah launched a central attack, but it was intercepted. Western Police's Ao Ke Lai dribbled the ball forward and safely passed it to the center. Te Fei lost his footing and kicked the ball out of bounds. After a brief pause, Western Police fouled again, and Li Yichen lost his footing, almost causing a disaster. Fortunately, Wei Li's shot was weak, missing the goal by just a few inches. Tung Wah launched a major counterattack. Wanxianghua charged forward with speed and precision, clearly visible. However, Mei En was tall and caught the ball with both hands. At this time, the ball was still circling in Western Police's defensive zone. Luo Haiguang chipped the ball into the center, and Sun and Jia made several short passes, showing great agility. When Jia passed the ball back to the center, Sun was a step too slow, and the effort fell short at the last moment, which was a pity. Western Police then seized the opportunity to advance. Pei Te charged forward alone, only five yards from the goal. Zhuang Youren rushed back to defend, blocking the shot and knocking it out of bounds. From the start until now, the two sides had been stalemated for twenty minutes, with neither side scoring. The audience was also uneasy. When Xianghua took a corner kick, Turner headed the ball, but it backfired, resulting in an own goal. Tung Wah scored first without effort.</p>
<p>Western Police Leads 3-2 in the First Half</p>
<p>The joy had barely passed when misfortune struck again. Western Police's center forward, Jack, received passes from both sides and shot from within the penalty area. Zhang Rongcai was momentarily distracted, and his diving save came too late. One goal was gained and one was lost, with only one minute separating the two. At twenty-four minutes, Tung Wah's offensive was strong when Western Police's right back, Douglas, violently tackled Wanxianghua inside the penalty area. Wan was injured and left the field. A penalty was awarded, and Dai Linjing took the shot. It went over the crossbar and out of bounds. Fortunately, Mei En moved before Dai had even stepped up, and a retake was ordered. Linjing confidently scored, putting them ahead again. Having lost a winger, Tung Wah felt restricted. Ao Ke Lai launched an attack. Sun Jinshun intercepted him midway, but Ao broke through again. Zhuang Youren hesitated for a moment, and Ao calmly scored, tying the game again at 2-2. After thirty-one minutes, Ao Ke Lai returned to the same spot and Zhuang Youren made a mistake, Zhang Rongcai stood in the wrong position, and Ao scored again. After this, the two sides remained stalemated for a long time without any progress. The first half ended with this score, with Western Police leading 3-2.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Association Reverses the Defeat to Win 6-4</p>
<p>After the lemon break, Wanxianghua returned to the field with an injury, and Tung Wah's strength doubled. Not long after the second half started, Tung Wah faced a dangerous situation but safely overcame it and immediately launched a counterattack. Sun and Jia advanced together, and Luo Haiguang's shot hit the post, another missed opportunity. Time flew by, and twenty-four minutes had passed in a flash. With Ga Xu directing the midfield for Western Police, the front line became active again. Wei Li led the attack, and Ao Ke Lai lay in ambush near the goalpost. He received the ball and gently shot, making it 4-2 to Western Police, causing the audience to feel dejected. Tung Wah's entire team was indignant. Jia Youliang launched a counterattack and shot, hitting He Lei in the body. Ga Xu staged another own goal, making it 3-4. Four minutes later, Western Police was offside. Chen Zhenhe took a free kick, Wanxianghua stepped forward and crossed the ball, and Dai Linjing caught up and scored, tying the game at 4-4. Western Police's offensive continued, and Tung Wah tried to trap them twice, but both of Ao Ke Lai's shots missed by inches. At thirty-six minutes, Zhuang Youren tackled and collided with a player, resulting in a penalty. With little time left, the outcome depended on this moment, making everyone sweat. Fortunately, Te Fei's shot was poor, hitting Rongcai's arms, averting the danger. Two minutes later, Turner blocked the ball with his arm, and Li Yichen took the penalty, but the ball flew high into the sky. Fortunately, three minutes later, they got another chance for a penalty. Sun Jinshun lived up to expectations and scored, determining the outcome of the game with only four minutes remaining. Unexpectedly, Dai Linjing added icing on the cake, scoring another goal one minute later, thus eliminating Western Police with a score of 6-4.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Continuous Intense Battles Lead to Fatigue; Jinan Unexpectedly Loses to Shakol; Russians Win 5-1; Jinan Relies Entirely on Penalty Kicks. <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Jinan and Shakol met again yesterday at Shen Garden for the first match of the second round of the Shanghai League A Group. Jinan had been engaged in intense battles for several consecutive days, especially the match against Guanghua the day before, which was crucial for the University League championship and required their full effort. With many injured players, the soldiers were exhausted. Moreover, with both the A Group and Reserve Group matches scheduled yesterday, they lacked replacements. The soldiers took to the field with injuries to face the tall and fast Shakol. With different levels of rest, the outcome was immediately apparent. The Soviet army scored two goals within ten minutes through Boro Ning and Kai Rong Wei Wei District, making it 2-0 and causing Jinan to lose heart. Jinan tried hard to advance, but ultimately lacked strength in their kicks, and good opportunities were lost. The first half ended with a score of 2-0. In the second half, Jinan's offensive became stronger. Chen Pengze, Wang Nanzhen, and Wu Shufen successively shot at the goal, but all missed by millimeters. Guan Zhiyang and Chen Chunxi also repeatedly defended against the enemy's siege. After twenty minutes of stalemate, Merlin Noffsky attacked alone, avoided a pass to the center, and Holololov rushed to chip the ball. Ye Peichu blocked it with his right hand, but due to his short stature, the ball slipped into the net. Soon after, Holololov received a corner kick from the left wing, shot low, Ye leaned down to catch it, but due to the excessive force, the ball bounced in again. At this time, Soviet Shakol had already scored four goals, while Jinan had nothing. Soon after, the Soviet army's left back committed a handball foul, and Shi Yongnan scored the penalty, finally breaking the duck egg record. The momentum gradually improved, and good opportunities came in succession, but ultimately due to fatigue, every crucial moment was lost due to weak kicks. With ten minutes left in the game, the Soviet army's right wing suddenly attacked, turned to the left wing, Kai Luo Lie District passed the ball to the center, Merlin Noffsky arrived just in time and shot fiercely. Even with Ye Peichu's great skills, he was unable to do anything. After this, Jinan lacked the ability to counterattack and suffered a crushing defeat of 5-1.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic, there has indeed been considerable progress in central government finances. For example, the financial report for the 23rd year of the Republic is now published. This is an obligation that the government of a democratic nation owes to its people. Without it, it cannot be said to serve the people, nor can it be said to be accountable to the people. However, this was impossible in the era of financial secrecy under the former Beijing government.</p>
<p>However, based on the statements in the previous reports, what we urgently want to understand is: What are the causes and effects of the massive expansion of today's revenues and expenditures? Where is the progress compared to the past? And what is the extent of that progress? Increased tax revenue does not necessarily indicate progress in the tax system. And an expanded expenditure cannot be simply concluded to be the result of political progress. There is no doubt that today's politics have advanced rapidly compared to the past, but is it indeed in line with economic principles? It seems that there is a need for review.</p>
<p>Speaking only of finance within the scope of finance, to what extent has the efficiency of financial administration been achieved? What is the impact of reorganizing the tax system, executing the budget, allocating finances, and providing public and private economic influence? The most ideal finance should not take "collection" as the basis of revenue for the public economy, but must be able to "produce" by itself to accumulate wealth, without competing with the people for profit, which is the best policy. However, very few countries in the world are able to do so. Our country, which is undergoing renewal, cannot immediately harbor such extravagant hopes. However, good finance must at least have a balance of income and expenditure. And it is not enough to just balance income and expenditure, it is necessary to ensure that every single penny of income and expenditure can have a good relationship with the people, both directly and indirectly. Therefore, after "taking from the people," it must be "used for the people"; and consideration should also be given to how to "take" and how to "use." The necessary rationality of the "taking" and "using" relationship is not only what the people of the whole country eagerly hope for, but also what the current authorities have set as a policy guideline, so our exploration should adhere to this point. Moreover, in this extraordinary period, if adjustments are not made quickly, so that "taking" conforms to the principle of minimizing sacrifice, retaining the flexibility of free elasticity, and "using" conforms to the principle of maximizing welfare, while being truly fully economical and fully rational, and has the function of adapting to extraordinary circumstances and completing extraordinary missions, and can ensure the natural development of public and private economies, and establish a sound foundation for peacetime response, then how can we talk about "saving the nation and seeking survival"?</p>
<p>The main purpose of this article is to explore the truth about central government finances in recent years, and the current state of its "taking" and "using" relationship. Therefore, it focuses on the organization and analysis of materials, and examines the process of development and the distribution of external influences. It does not indulge in empty talk, nor does it intend to make judgments. And it takes the narrow sense of finance as the scope. The figures cited are all based on the Financial Yearbook, Economic Yearbook, and successive accounting reports (all official figures), as well as the Shenbao Yearbook, and Shi Shiyi's "Financial History of the Republic of China" and its sequels, cross-referenced, selectively chosen, and recompiled and recalculated to discover the actual figures for "taking" and "using." Therefore, the results obtained are quite different from the publicly announced figures. This is because the publicly announced figures are mainly based on the net amount of direct revenue and expenditure of the national treasury, while what we want to pay attention to is the total amount of all revenue and expenditure of the national treasury, both directly and indirectly. This is why this article is titled "The Truth." As the public announcement is being made, it is believed that the people of the country are also happy to conduct further inspection. Therefore, may I take advantage of the valuable space of this publication to share it with like-minded people. Due to the author's limited talent and knowledge, errors are inevitable. I still hope that enlightened scholars will teach me!</p>
<p>(2) The Surge of Financial Expansion</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government, the central government's expenditure has expanded year by year, which is a well-known fact. When the budget for the 16th year of the Republic was implemented, the final amount of expenditure was only 148 million yuan. However, in this year (the 25th year of the Republic), the budgeted amount of expenditure has soared to 991 million yuan. If the 16th year of the Republic is taken as the base year for the index, then the index for this year is 669.6; that is, it has increased sharply by 570%; in other words, it has increased sharply by more than five times. The average annual expenditure for the past ten years is calculated as 603 million yuan; enough to cover the total expenses of the past four or five years. Indeed, the expenditure of the past three or four years is sufficient to cover the total expenditure of the past six or seven years. The average expenditure index for the past ten years has also reached 462.1%, which is more than three and a half times higher than before, which shows the expansion of expenditure.</p>
<p>Since expenditure has expanded dramatically, revenue must also be increased strongly. Those who manage finances believe that the reason why public economy is not the same as private economy is that the former is "determining income based on expenditure," while the latter is "determining expenditure based on income."</p>
<p>In the 16th year of the Republic, the central government was still mainly located in the Jiangnan area; therefore, the final amount of revenue was only 80 million yuan (limited to normal revenue such as tax revenue; income from loans, etc. was excluded); later, the provinces revolted, and the country was formally unified, and huge subsidies were paid to exchange for the promotion and centralization of financial administration power. This exchange may not be a real problem in terms of national treasury revenue and expenditure, but it is what should be in terms of financial system. For a unified country, to build a modern country, the unification and centralization of financial power is the most basic requirement. With the unification and centralization of financial power, the annual revenue increased day by day; but because there was no real benefit to speak of, and the expansion of expenditure was as described above, it was necessary to work hard to increase tax rates and open up new sources of revenue. If the revenue amount of the 16th year of the Republic is taken as 100, then the average index for the past ten years has soared to 789.3; that is, the average increase is 689.3%; which is even greater than the increase rate of expenditure. If this year is compared with the 16th year of the Republic, then the increase rate has reached 862%. That is, it has increased more than eight and a half times compared to ten years ago.</p>
<p>Although the annual increase rate of revenue is greater than the increase rate of expenditure, the absolute figure, that is, the annual amount of revenue, is far less than the annual amount of expenditure. The average annual revenue for the past ten years is only 566 million yuan. The year with the largest revenue is only 770 million yuan. However, compared with the revenue amount of only tens of millions of yuan ten years ago, it has indeed increased sharply by six or seven times; and compared with the average annual expenditure of 635 million yuan over the years, the annual deficit is still as high as more than 100 million yuan on average. This deficit alone is almost enough to cover the entire expenditure of any year ten years ago.</p>
<p>Not only that, the deficit has become a normal state of our country's finance; there is no year without exception. And the amount of the deficit is increasing year by year. If the 16th year of the Republic is taken as the base year for the index, then the index for this year has reached 326.5; that is, it has increased by 226.5% compared to ten years ago; the average deficit index for the past ten years is 213%; that is, it has increased by 113% on average compared to before. Take a look at the first table - Annual Central Government Revenue and Expenditure Final Amount and its Index (unit: million yuan)</p>
<p>(Note) (1) The years from the 6th to the 14th year of the Republic are the era of the Beijing Government. The final amount of expenditure is based on the average annual amount of the total of military, political, and debt expenses directly paid by the Accounting Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Guan Yan Two Departments at that time. (2) The years from the 14th to the 15th year of the Republic are the era of the National Government of Guangdong and Wuhan: the following are the years since the establishment of the Nanjing National Government. Revenue and expenditure are all final figures, but the most recent two years are estimated figures. (3) The expenditure items include political debts and various expenses, and also include the collection fees directly used, which were removed from the previous reports, the amount owed from the previous year and paid in this year, and various temporary accounts; in the 17th year of the Republic, there were also various refunds. All are calculated together, and the remaining balance is deducted to show the actual expenditure of the national treasury. (4) The revenue items include tax revenue and income from state-owned business investments, etc., and also include the collection fees directly used, which were deducted in the previous public announcements; and deduct the income from debt funds and other temporary revenue, and the revenue owed from this year, etc. to clarify the actual revenue of the national treasury. (5) The deficit is based on the remainder after deducting the revenue amount from the expenditure amount. Therefore, the debt income amount is also included.</p>
<p>In the past, when talking about a balanced budget, it was always said to "increase revenue and reduce expenditure." Looking back at the sharp increase in revenue over the years, it can be seen that "straightening out tax revenue" and finding ways to "increase revenue" have indeed achieved remarkable results. However, the increase rate of revenue is 327% greater than the increase rate of expenditure, and the result is still not enough to maintain income balance; which is enough to indicate the weakness of the inherent poverty of the people's tax-paying ability.</p>
<p>Indeed: the people's tax-paying ability is originally composed of the possessions and income of China, and the increase or decrease of possessions and income is the result of the prosperity or decline of the national economy. Therefore, the financial foundation must be built on a sound national economy in order to maintain it without decay. However, the merits of the financial system and the influence of financial activities are also sufficient to dominate the rise and fall of the national economy. Because the two are indeed related to each other, we need to study the internal weaknesses of the strengthening of financial panic over the years.</p>
<p>(3) The Effect of Revenue Enhancement Plans Over the Years</p>
<p>According to a review of the budgets of various years since the 18th year of the Republic, compared with the final accounts; on the revenue side, the actual receipts are always more than 10% less than the budgeted amount. This phenomenon can be interpreted in two ways: one is that due to the excessive expansion of expenditure, the revenue budget amount has to be overestimated in order to reduce the large deficit on the budget paper. The second is that perhaps under each new revenue enhancement plan, the hope is fully estimated, but the result always fails to meet expectations. This fact is enough to illustrate the unbearable nature of the people's tax-paying ability; and from the financial standpoint, there is also a need for practical reform of the revenue enhancement plans over the years.</p>
<p>"Note, the revenue amount of the budget final accounts does not include debt income.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that tax revenue is the main body of our country's revenue, so all revenue enhancement plans over the years inevitably take the tax system as the sole target. It is also what is expected. Over the years, by "straightening out the tax system," things have been expanded: in terms of the increase in tax revenue, there has indeed been great progress. For example, the tax revenue in the 18th year of the Republic was only 116 million yuan; in the 15th year of the Republic, it sharply increased to 680 million yuan. It has increased sharply by 63.5% in eight years. And the increase in the most recent four years has been even more drastic. The average annual tax revenue for the four years from the 18th to the 21st year of the Republic was 492 million yuan, that is, the average increase was 17.5% in four years. But in the four years from the 22nd to the 25th year of the Republic, its average annual tax revenue has sharply increased to 652 million yuan. The average increase was 56.6%.</p>
<p>The sharp increase in tax revenue is as described above, but its position in the total revenue amount is decreasing day by day. For example, the ratio of tax revenue to total revenue in the 18th year of the Republic was 76.6%; in the 21st year of the Republic, it even increased to 79.9%: the average ratio for these four years was 75.2%. However, in the following four years, its average ratio has decreased to 69.9%; for example, in the 23rd year of the Republic, it was only 66.7%; and in the 25th year of the Republic, it was only 68.8%. This phenomenon is enough to illustrate that relying solely on the method of increasing taxes is far from enough to cope with the demand for a largely expanding expenditure, as shown in the third table:</p>
<p>Not only that, the so-called "straightening out the tax system" over the years is nothing more than strictly cracking down on smuggling, increasing tax rates, or opening up new tax sources. In terms of the financial principles of taxation, is it in line with economics? It is still a question. Not to mention its impact on the national economy. Take a look at the sharp increase in financial expenses since the 18th year of the Republic, its momentum is no less than the increase rate of tax revenue. As shown in the fourth table. (unit: million yuan)</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the average financial expenses have increased by 31.5% in the past eight years; indeed, in the salt affairs, due to the occupation of the Northeast salt administration by the Japanese puppet regime, the active organization of salt fields in the interior, the addition of salt police, the construction of warehouses, and the strict crackdown on smuggling have resulted in the largest increase in its expenses, reaching as high as 74%. Although the Northeast customs administration was also occupied, its expenses also increased by 21%. In terms of consolidated tax, due to the recent increase in new tax sources, the collection and grazing fees have also increased greatly. The average increase in the past eight years is 38.5%. In addition to these three major taxes, the administrative expenses of other taxes such as mining tax, stamp duty, and tobacco and alcohol tax have also increased across the board. The administrative expenses of mining tax were only 26,000 yuan in the 18th year of the Republic; in the 25th year of the Republic, they sharply increased to 534,000 yuan. An increase of more than 19 times. The average increase rate in the past eight years has also been at the high peak of 110.13%. The administrative expenses of stamp duty, tobacco and alcohol tax were only 3.55 million yuan in the 18th year of the Republic, but in the 25th year of the Republic, they have increased to over 5.2 million yuan, an increase of 47%; the average increase rate in the past eight years is 54.31%, but its total effect of increasing financial expenses only makes the total tax revenue increase by an average of slightly more than 56%. In terms of each tax, the tax with the largest increase rate is also the mining tax. The average increase in the past eight years is 1248.76%, which is indeed the consolidated tax, with an average increase of 96.4%; followed by stamp duty, tobacco and alcohol tax; with an average increase of 41.09%; followed by salt tax, with an average increase of 32.5%. Customs duty has an average increase of 20%. Take a look at the fifth table (unit: thousand yuan)</p>
<p>In finance, a tax must be collected with low collection costs and high tax revenue in order to be in line with economic principles. However, looking at various taxes, except for the consolidated tax administrative expenses, which account for only 4% of the consolidated tax revenue on average, the others account for more than 10%. For example, the mining tax fee in the 20th year of the Republic accounts for as much as 28.68% of the tax revenue; the average ratio in the past eight years has also reached 16.91%; the stamp duty, tobacco and alcohol tax fee in the 22nd year of the Republic accounts for 19.02% of the revenue; the average ratio in the past eight years is over 17%. Salt affairs fee accounts for 12% of the revenue on average; customs fee accounts for 10.26% of the revenue on average. The total financial fee accounts for as much as 9.78% of the total tax revenue on average. Although there has been a downward trend in recent years, the total tax revenue in the 25th year of the Republic will also be discounted by 195% due to the expenditure of financial fees. Take a look at the sixth table.</p>
<p>Percentage of tax affairs fees to the income of the tax itself</p>
<p>Note: Statistics based on the fourth and fifth tables. The ratio of financial expenses is to the total tax revenue.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong once said in the report of the 23rd year of the Republic, "For the tax collection agencies, either reorganize them or merge them, in order to save expenses and improve administration; since the implementation, it has been quite effective. The financial administrative fee has been reduced compared to before, and compared with tax revenue, its ratio was 11% in the 20th year, 9.9% in the 21st and 22nd year; and 9.2% in the 23rd and 24th year." The ratio seems to be still too low compared to what we have statistically calculated. However, this trend has indeed been formed. It cannot be said that this is the progress of financial administration today. However, looking back at the fourth table, today's austerity is still far from being comparable to the past, and it is hoped that the authorities can add more impetus.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of expenditure, the expenditure of financial fees is almost equal to the entire total amount of other administrative expenses; and sometimes it even exceeds it. The amount is only second to the military affairs and debt fees. It goes without saying that it is a major burden on finance. During this period of preparing for national defense and actively suppressing bandits, there is only concern that the military affairs fee cannot be increased, and there is no reason to reduce it again. The debt fee is related to national credit, and reserves the space to make up for future financial deficits, so it is also difficult to reduce it. Therefore, for the sake of balancing the budget and strengthening the finance, the only way is to reduce the administrative affairs fee and the financial fee. Reducing the political fee does not mean a general salary reduction, but in addition to salary reduction, we should also engage in cutting redundant officials and abolishing redundant posts; this will greatly contribute to the transformation of the administrative system and the increase of administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>Moreover, the expenditure of financial fees is actually equivalent to the entire nation paying taxes to provide for tax officials. The special fees of each tax are actually the additional tax levied on each tax. Today, 9.78% of the country's total tax revenue is the income from the additional tax levied for financial fees. Therefore, the larger the ratio of each tax affairs fee to the tax itself, the higher the tax rate of its additional tax. In order to relieve the people's difficulties and reduce the tax rate, we should first reduce this additional tax rate.</p>
<p>Not only that, today's increase in tax grazing is not the result of improved financial fees and increased administrative efficiency. Take the salt tax as an example.</p>
<p>In recent years, efforts have been spared to rectify the salt affairs. Rectifying salt fields, building warehouses, and widely setting up tax police have all increased salt affairs fees: and the purpose is to prevent smuggling and attempt to increase tax revenue. According to the fifth table, in the past eight years, salt tax revenue has increased by an average of 32.5%; but according to the fourth table, the expenditure of salt affairs fees has increased by an average of 74.1%. Paying twice the price and only getting one effect: it can be said that "doing more work with half the result." It is obvious that the gains do not make up for the losses. If the amount of smuggling fees is increasing year by year, and the national salt release is still very small, it can be said that its effect is weak. Take a look at the seventh table: (unit: million yuan and dan)</p>
<p>In the past eight years, the smuggling fee has increased by an average of 11 times: the salt release has only increased by 9.5%; spending 11 times the smuggling fee, only 9.5% of the smuggled salt has been confiscated into official salt. The average increase rate of salt tax is 29.5%: on the other hand, the salt tax rate has increased by 65.3%. It can be seen that the tax revenue progress rate is far less than the tax rate increase rate; and the great function of cracking down on smuggling may only prevent the new smuggled salt from evading tax due to the sharp increase in the tax rate. The price is so high, but the effect is only mediocre. It can be seen that increasing the tax rate and strictly cracking down on smuggling is obviously not a good idea. It is very obvious. This forecast is probably not unique to the salt tax.</p>
<p>Indeed, smuggling is originally a criminal act. If it were not for the excessive tax burden and the people's unbearable life, who would be willing to take the risk again? Salt is a daily necessity for everyone, and it is said that tax on it is a great source of wealth from a financial standpoint. If the country has 450 million people, and each person consumes 15 catties of salt per year, then the national annual salt release must be at least 67.5 million dan. If the tax rate implements the new salt law's regulations of 2.5 yuan per city ancestor; then the annual tax revenue can reach 163 million yuan. Once the tax rate is reduced, smugglers will be reduced; if more economical collection fees are used to reform transportation and sales and crackdown on smuggling, and fully improve their administrative efficiency, then the financial benefits obtained will be more than today; and the burden on people's lives will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Moreover, the benefits and harms of taxation on people's lives are like double-edged swords. Its right edge can destroy the national economy and dry up the tax source; its left edge can help the national economy and cultivate the national financial resources. Therefore, whether it is a disaster or a blessing depends on how to use its edge.</p>
<p>(4) Changes and Expectations in the Content of Expenditure</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, in the past ten years, the central government's expenditure has increased by an average of more than three and a half times. In the past, the largest increase rate was in the three categories of military affairs, finance, and debt expenses. However, since the 22nd year of the Republic, the content with the largest increase has changed. Economic administrative expenses, cultural education expenses, administrative judicial expenses, subsidies, etc. are all increasing rapidly. This change is indeed a sign of great progress in the central government's finances compared to the past. Is it not also a manifestation of being stimulated by national disasters? Take a look at the eighth table</p>
<p>Final Accounts of Various Expenditures and Their Indices and Ratios (unit: thousand yuan)</p>
<p>"Note" (1) The Beijing government era includes the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 8th, and 14th years of the Republic; the above numbers are the total average of the estimated averages for those four years (2) Subsidies include Mongolian and Tibetan expenses in the mountains, (3) Financial expenses in the Beijing era also included debt expenses. (4) Cultural and education expenses, formerly known as education expenses, or expenses in charge of the Ministry of Education (5) Economic administrative expenses, including transportation, industry, private establishment, and state-owned capital investment. In the past, they included agriculture, commerce, transportation, and industry. In the 18th year of the Republic, there were also items such as industry and commerce, agriculture and mining, and health. (6) Administrative judicial expenses, including former foreign affairs, internal affairs, and judicial affairs; or expenses of various agencies. Today, they include state affairs expenses, internal affairs expenses, judicial affairs expenses, foreign affairs expenses, and pension expenses. (7) The ratio is obtained by calculating each expense against the total expenditure of the current year. (8) The index is based on the 18th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>National taxpayers believe that the purpose of fulfilling their due obligations is not entirely to maintain the administrative organization of the country, but to obtain guarantees of life, property, and all business and life, and to have full convenience for improvement and development. The country also has the right to levy taxes on the people based on this contribution. Regardless of the origin of the country and its realistic essence, it is not like this. However, modern political thought all takes this as a guideline. Therefore, the country's levy of taxes must conform to the principle of minimizing sacrifice and maximizing welfare. And the country's use of tax money must also conform to the principle of minimizing sacrifice and maximizing welfare; in other words: a good tax system makes the people feel less sacrificed when paying taxes and can expect the greatest welfare. The country then spends the tax money collected at the lowest cost, in order to maintain and create the greatest public welfare; and fulfill its due responsibilities to the people. In this way, society can prosper and move upward, and the foundation of the country can be strengthened and consolidated. Finance can also be maintained without fatigue. Therefore, the nature of the country's revenue is only the circulation of wealth, and the nature of expenditure is actually equal to intangible or tangible production investment. The greater the amount of tangible production investment, the more sound the financial foundation and the greatest welfare created. Therefore, the allocation of expenditure funds is the key to the merits of the national political system.</p>
<p>Looking at the various expenditures of the country over the years, in the past nine years, military expenses have accounted for an average of 40.29% of the total expenditure; debt expenses have accounted for 32.05%; the two together account for 72.34%. Subsidies, most of which actually have the nature of military expenses, account for an average of 6.23%. Then the total is 78.57%. Financial expenses, administrative judicial expenses, and party affairs expenses can be collectively called political expenses. The average ratio of these over the past nine years is 13.04%. The above-mentioned expenses, as they are now, are essentially no different from pure consumption. The other two expenses are more active in production, but their ratio is only 8.54% in total.</p>
<p>However, since the 22nd year of the Republic, military expenses have decreased by 36.55%; the average ratio in the past four years has decreased by 37.98%. Although the absolute amount of debt expenses has decreased little, the average ratio has decreased to 27.5%. Subsidies, during this period, have increased sharply by 532.8%. Its average ratio is 8.63%. The ratio of the three combined has decreased to 74.11%.</p>
<p>During this period, although the absolute amount of financial expenses has also decreased little, the ratio has decreased to 7.17%; the absolute amount of administrative judicial expenses has increased sharply by 49.6%; but its average ratio is still only 3.69%. Because this expense was very small in the past, a slight increase, although very small in the total largely expanding expenditure, in the vertical comparison, it has been felt that its progress is fast. If party affairs expenses are added, the average ratio of these three expenses in this period has also decreased to 11.47%.</p>
<p>However, cultural education and economic administration expenses have all increased sharply in this period. The former's absolute amount has increased by 198%; the average ratio has expanded to 3.5%; the latter's absolute amount has increased sharply by 1648.6%; the average ratio has increased and expanded to 11%. The average ratio of the two combined during this period is 14.5%. The rate of increase in the absolute amount is faster than the expansion of the average ratio, for the same reason as the increase in administrative judicial expenses.</p>
<p>In terms of the responsibilities of the state, whether it is culture, laws and regulations, education, or defense, they should be actively organized. Indeed, in our country, everything has been abandoned, and we should advance simultaneously and carry out practical consolidation. However, in this time of people's poverty and financial exhaustion, and with internal and external troubles, it is impossible to do everything at once. Therefore, weighing the importance and choosing the key points to proceed first is a necessary path. Then we can celebrate greatly for the fact that the center of gravity of expenditure is changing.</p>
<p>However, from the financial point of view, we cannot help but feel new worries about today's changes. Precisely because the people are impoverished and the country is financially exhausted, every move should adhere to economic principles. We cannot waste money because of popular support, make finance an unsustainable expansion, and fall into greater panic. Or, for the convenience of various agencies in carrying out affairs, expand the scale, add organizations, and hire personnel, creating a situation where officials are more than jobs, and jobs are abandoned due to the mutual constraints of various related agencies: things are limited by financial consumption in the salary expenditures of redundant officials and supervisors. This disrupts the complete administrative system, reduces the efficiency of administration, and wastes national treasury, strengthening the financial crisis. Unfortunately, this phenomenon occurs frequently in economic administration.</p>
<p>When He Lian studied the issue of adjusting the central administrative organization today (his paper was published in the Nankai University Journal of Political Economy, Volume 4, Issue 3), he listed in detail the complexity and confusion of the central administrative organizations, and strongly stated its impropriety. And he believed that the economic administration's multitude of agencies and divided responsibilities were very serious. It can be seen that in this rapidly expanding economic administration fee, a large part must be the expenditure of salary for redundant officials and supervisors. Therefore, in order to improve administrative efficiency, we should adjust the administrative structure; in order to balance the budget, save waste, and supplement reasonable expenditure, we should also adjust the administrative structure, as a means to practice the promise of "reducing expenditure."</p>
<p>"Five" The Impact of the Expansion of Revenue and Expenditure on Finance</p>
<p>The sharp increase in normal revenue is not enough to meet the demand for a largely expanding expenditure. The amount of the annual deficit in the national treasury is also so huge. Therefore, the means to balance the budget is only to issue national debt and allocate credit.</p>
<p>According to Finance Minister Kong's report, the recent sharp increase in national debt is "mostly used to repay old debts"; and he also said that "the shortfall of each year can be largely offset by the expenditure of repaying debts." This is indeed a faithful explanation of borrowing to repay debts.</p>
<p>Not only that, the amount of debt repaid over the years is not as large as the amount of new debt issued. Because not only is issuing new debt a means to make up for the budget deficit, but also all unreceived tax money is converted into treasury bills or loans to pay for urgently needed money. In the past ten years, an average of 319 million yuan of new debt has been issued annually; almost equal to the total expenditure of the past two or three years ten years ago. The amount of debt raised is greater than the amount of debt repaid and the deficit, which is more dangerous than "borrowing to repay debts." Finance Minister Kong's report also said that "The newly issued bonds are issued at a discount to the face value, so the actual interest is extremely high. And the national tax revenue that has been designated as the guarantee for the new debt is also increasing day by day." It is truly the suffering that can only be imagined by those who have personally experienced it. Take a look at the ninth table:</p>
<p>(Note) Unit: million yuan, the number before the 23rd year is the final account, and the number after is the estimated amount. New debt includes domestic and foreign debt, loans and outstanding amounts, and debt rolling includes industrial bonds; the rolling amount of this year is as of the end of March, and is calculated by year. The new debt of this year includes the sum of the amount reduced annually by 85 million yuan in debt fees by the central government due to the issue of reunification bonds, rehabilitation, and Sichuan relief.</p>
<p>According to this, it can be known that the annual increase rate of debt is at least 12.1% higher than the previous year; the highest increase rate is as high as 224.2%, as in this year. Its average increase rate is 56%. In the past ten years, the issue increase rate is 443.3%; the debt rolling amount increase rate is 596.1%; ten years later, the rolling amount of national debt will surely exceed 10 billion yuan. The increased issuance and circulation of national debt can indeed promote currency inflation. (Please see the fourth section of my humble book in the Social Economic Monthly Report, Volume 3, Issue 7 for the reason) According to the China Bank report, "The amount of securities held by national banks is equal to the amount of paid-in capital of national banks; and even exceeds it," and these securities are all government bonds. Furthermore, the means for banks to bear government bonds often rely on increasing their paper money issuance, and those with capital often convert it into money after receiving government bonds; the country pays the income occupied by the government to the people, and then increases the people's deposits in banks. Increased deposits help to increase currency issuance. Currency circulation is attacked by panic, and then condenses into interest-seeking capital. As a result, the cash reserve ratio only decreases and does not increase. The circulation of currency will all be transformed into book assets. Therefore, the actual benefits of expansion have not been obtained, but the foundation of expansion has been formed. The double threat of debt interest and commodity prices makes the expansion of financial expenditure endless. In addition to paying taxes to the state, the people must also pay taxes to the state's creditors.</p>
<p>However, today's gradual change in expenditure, shifting its focus to economic administration and engaging in productive investment, has enabled finance to reap considerable benefits. In recent years, in addition to the two major incomes of tax revenue and debt funds, the income from state-owned enterprises and investment profits has also gradually increased. If the authorities can move forward with this new policy, the financial foundation should have hope of turning danger into safety. Take a look at the tenth table: Analysis of the content of revenue over the years.</p>
<p>(Note) Other income includes income from state-owned railways, interest income from bank official shares, and the revenue owed from this year.</p>
<p>The above table shows that in the past seven years, although tax revenue has occupied the highest position in revenue, its increase rate is the lowest. Only increasing year by year, except when the 918 Incident and the recent armed smuggling trend in North China occurred, there was an exceptional decline. But by strengthening tax revenue in other areas, the loss was compensated for: therefore, the decline rate was not large. Debt funds occupy the second highest position in revenue, but its ratio, like tax revenue, has a downward trend. However, other income, which was negligible in revenue in the past, has become increasingly important in recent years. Although it includes the revenue owed, making it difficult for us to draw conclusions. But in general, it is not impossible for revenue items to also have a changing situation. This is exactly what we are looking forward to. Two five, one one, three zero, evening</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened. Due to profit-taking by bulls at home and abroad, uncertainties in British politics, the upcoming government report, and weekend selling pressure, as well as the uncertainty of the government management law in New Orleans, October contracts were sold off, with prices falling two to six points per pound. Traders purchased on price dips. Currently, cotton is firm, while the cloth market is relatively slow. At closing, there was some buying, and the market situation was stable. Spot prices fell eight points per pound, while futures prices fell three to eight points per pound. British cotton spot prices fell one point, while futures prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by mainland merchants and exporters, and short covering, but later fell due to profit-taking by bulls. Pingguo'er fell 0.25 rupees, Aomula rose 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, and Bairoxi rose 0.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (5th dispatch)</p>

<p>After being expensive in February and March this year, tinplate went into a slump.

<p>— (Fang Shujun)</p>
<p>"Obstacles" are our sharpest weapons for advancement. The happiness of a person lies in discovering and removing obstacles. Because an obstacle blocks one's ambition, it inevitably gives rise to a kind of courage to overcome it. The greater the obstacle, the fiercer one's courage and the more one strives for progress; otherwise, one is a mediocre person.</p>
<p>"If one does not exert oneself, one will inevitably become decadent; if one does not restrain oneself, one will inevitably become licentious." These words of Zhu Xi are the experience. If we want to be self-reliant, self-strengthening, and self-helping in the world, we must endure hardship and work hard to move forward. Wounds and overturns, thorns and reefs are not enough to hinder our progress.</p>
<p>"The mountains and rivers dyed red with our blood will surely belong to us. The survival and honor of the nation can only be maintained by the heads and blood of our own people. Make the world powers realize that we Chinese men are lions and not sheep." These are the words of Mr. Luo Jialun comforting and encouraging the Suiyuan soldiers. At this time of national crisis and ethnic peril, we should fully strive for the country and the nation, embracing the spirit of struggle and the determination to sacrifice, and take on the heavy responsibility of "wielding weapons to defend the country." Only then can the mountains and rivers of our great Chinese nation, dyed red with blood, be possessed by us.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Xu Guqing's Proficiency in Literature <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Guqing, who died of illness in Shanghai on September 13 of this year, was once the commander of the Ninth Division of the Army in the late Qing Dynasty. During the Xinhai Revolution, he attacked Ning and was promoted as the commander-in-chief of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Allied Forces. He followed the Prime Minister south to uphold the Constitution and served as the commander-in-chief of the Guangzhou Garrison and concurrently supervised troop training. Therefore, people all thought he was a brave warrior. Unexpectedly, Mr. Xu was not born in the army. In his youth, his father, Mr. Ziyuan, was a classics teacher and a famous secretary. He was well-read and versatile. He received his family education and studied diligently, researching the learning of the Song Confucians. At the age of nineteen, he was hired by Huaiyuan County as a criminal secretary. After work, he studied classics, gathered disciples, established learning societies, and taught diligently. He also studied medicine extensively and often treated his own illnesses. He also passed the imperial examination in the Jiazi year of the Guangxu era and entered the staff of Governors Zhang Guangyu and Li Mianlin of Guilin. When Li Mianlin was promoted to Governor of Jiangxi, he followed him to Jiangxi and entered officialdom. As a Daoist, he assisted Li in investigating the Jiangxi religious cases and concluded more than 2,000 cases in three months. Therefore, he was praised for his ability and was appointed as the head of the Military Academy and the chief of camp affairs, leading the new army. At that time, Mr. Xu resigned because he was not familiar with military affairs. Governor Li asked him to use the learning of Laozi to govern the army, believing that he would be invincible. He once said that it was easy to get a famous general, but difficult to find a Confucian general, and asked him not to resign. From then on, he was in charge of military affairs wherever he went, and his literary talent was buried. In addition to being the general manager of the Camp Affairs Office in Jiangxi, he commanded the standing army in Guangdong, and he was the chief of the Military Affairs Bureau in Fujian. In Jiangnan, he was the chief of the Staff and Training Office, and he also commanded the standing army. He personally drafted the regulations for the new army's organization and the model orders, and he handled the micro-soldiers. Many of the generals in his department had revolutionary ideas, such as Zhao Boxian, who died in Huanghuagang, Xiong Chengji, who died in the uprising in Anhui, and Bai Wenwei, who filled the position of Governor of Anhui. At that time, they were all under his command. Governor Duan Fang of Jiangxi named them for arrest, but he rescued them and escaped. Recently, he served as a member of the National Government, but due to illness, he often recuperated in Shanghai, calling himself the Old Man of Learning and Longevity, and wrote books such as the Anthology of Learning and Longevity Hall, Poetry Theory, and Poetry Collection for his own entertainment.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Street of Terror <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>XXX Road has long been known as the "Street of Mystery" because it has foreign girls selling their bodies; it also has domestic men and women doing secret plays that are harmful to customs and shocking to hear; in addition, cafes, dance halls, gambling dens, opium dens... also have special scenery, so it has won that mysterious emblem. However, since the "January 28th" Incident, the depression of the market and the strict crackdown by the police and patrol rooms have made these mysterious activities less rampant than before. Therefore, the name "Street of Mystery" is somewhat unworthy of the name.</p>
<p>Last year and this year, two international assassination cases occurred near this "Street of Mystery," and the assassinated people were brave warriors who held the important task of protecting overseas Chinese. "Zhang Tianshi was bewitched by ghosts," and it was somewhat embarrassing on the surface. Therefore, on the one hand, they negotiated with the municipal government of this city; on the other hand, they demonstrated to the citizens. The XXX Road had a post every five steps and a sentry every ten steps, with real guns and live ammunition, knives unsheathed, tanks and machine cars constantly patrolling, and suddenly it was filled with a tense atmosphere. Residents living nearby had tasted the flavor of the "January 28th" night, so they fled! Fled! Fled to the center of the concession, fled to the countryside in the interior. The XXX Road suddenly became deserted, with nine out of ten houses empty and few pedestrians. Along the north side, fifteen out of ten shops were closed, and no longer could be heard the music of the dance hall, the noise of the sailors, and the laughter of the enchanting women. The people walking on the road were also full of worries, and if they were not careful, they would suffer the disaster of being a fish in the pond. The families living by the roadside should also be careful of fire, be cautious in everything. Dropping a longan pit or splashing a basin of washing water would not only violate the police regulations, but also face the danger of military law. The XXX Road, which has always been known as mysterious, has become known as the street of terror because the residents are trembling and the pedestrians are trembling.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Eve of the Revolution <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Manzi</p>
<p>The history of the National Revolution is tragic. It is not long ago, and we are easily longing for it. But we want a deep remembrance. Although it is a rehash of old events, it is a very good history textbook.</p>
<p>"Life and Death Together" writes about the eve of the revolution, the brutality of the warlords, and the struggles of the revolutionary comrades. Of course, it is a painful historical trace. Director Ying Yunwei handled this imaginable story in a very sharp way, because he used all his strength to develop the tense emotions. Therefore, no one who has seen this film does not solemnly expect the development of the facts. For a full hour, they could not even breathe until the revolutionary army finally won and they could recover from the suffocation in the cheers. But the terror obtained may take more time to fade. Therefore, in the miasma of soft films, this is a film that rises suddenly from the army.</p>
<p>We don't need to associate it with the national defense issue, but national defense requires the people to sacrifice everything, and it requires the people to never give up. To encourage the people, there must be strong stimulation and excitement. "Life and Death Together" bears this mission, so in the final life-and-death juncture when the national crisis is serious, we should take "Life and Death Comrades" as a textbook for raising awareness and awakening. To put it bluntly, "Life and Death Comrades" is a reference book for national defense education.</p>
<p>We remember that the greatest help of the National Revolutionary Army was the propaganda work. "Life and Death Comrades" writes about the success of the propaganda work, and the setbacks encountered before the success are the different and similar types of the martyrs that the central government has successively commended. Then "Life and Death Comrades" can also be said to be a representative work of the Kuomintang Party history.</p>
<p>In terms of technology, Yuan Muzhi can play two roles at the same time, and he can take care of the plot without being stiff or abrupt. In terms of the personality of two different people, he can use the reflection ability to the extreme. Chen Bo'er also showed the self-awareness of women. Today's new women should be like this. Yun Guangzhao, a humorous hero, has small actions in his solemn performance, which are like a smiling star shining in the dark clouds when it is raining.</p>
<h3 id="e181">High Pillow <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Xianwei</p>
<p>The common saying "sleep high and worry-free" originally described a group of people who spent their years leisurely, "worry-free about clothes" and "worry-free about food," but the high pillow I am talking about now is not like this. In the past, it really made a big splash, sleeping publicly for many years, and sleeping on it was indeed carefree and out of the dust! However, now that the times have changed, this kind of high pillow can no longer be slept on, and it has become a high pillow with worries. This high pillow, also known as the "smart pillow," is often slept on by opium addicts. The oil stains are at least two points high. When wheezing and snotting, they lie down and blow a few pipes, which stimulates their minds and makes them energetic. You can't think of difficult problems, and events that cannot be solved will be solved easily. It is truly a wonderful elixir!</p>
<p>In recent years, the government's prohibitions have become stricter and stricter. It is said that from next year, if anyone is caught sleeping on a high pillow privately, their head will be asked to move! What's more, this year has been a bottomless pit: thousands and hundreds of acres of good farmland, three-entry and four-beam halls, beautiful "wives" like flowers, and lively and delicate sons can be accommodated as much as possible, and the fancy banknotes are used up. In the end, they still have to be caught in the net of the law. What is the point! I advise the blacklisted compatriots to wake up quickly!</p>
<p>Some people say that one of the reasons why sports are not developed in China is that they like to sleep on high pillows. Indeed, the pillows we sleep on every day are at least half a foot high, so everyone is bent over and creating a large number of hunchbacks, the style is really modern! You must know that the higher the pillow, the more curved the back, so the lungs will naturally not be very developed, and the physique will not be strong again? This also makes sense, so not only opium addicts should not sleep on high pillows, but ordinary people are also unsuitable; even if they can't get rid of it, it is better to be lower!</p>

<p>— Wu Zhuzhong</p>
<p>The national scourge has not ceased, and I only feel that the sleeping lion has awakened day by day. The mountains and rivers are stained with blood and tears, and heroes from all directions display their heroism. The chariots and horses are swift beyond the Great Wall, and the plants and trees in the battlefields are stained with the smell of killing thieves. Not asking what happened in those years, the general's ambition is so high that it reaches the blue sky.</p>
<p>The military orders are strict like frost and camps are set up on the ground. The sound of war drums rumbles for a hundred thousand Xiong Ba. I am willing to use iron and blood to quell the chaos of the times, and I do not care about my family or life and death. The flames of war spread and invade the Hu moon, and the victory or defeat of weapons is like a national chess game. The festering wounds are the heroic deeds of fierce battles, and the aura that conquers the city is like the pressure of a city.</p>
<p>In the tiger tent, the inkstone condenses and drafts are planned. Heroic ambition wants to sever the flow in the water. Carrying bits in their mouths, they trudge through the snow to chase the barbarians, and dance swords and fly frost to shoot at the Big Dipper. Wrapping the body in horsehide is a loyal promise to the country, and lying in the sand field and watching the moon is a laugh at being ennobled. Now that the lifelong wish has not been fulfilled, I will sweep away the evil spirits and be a companion with the ancients.</p>
<p>The moon is full in the lonely city and the saddle is not untied. Driving the chariot and horses at dawn and dusk. The flags are illuminated by the sun and cut off the heads of the enemy, and the horns are blown by the wind to sharpen the iron liver. The generosity dyes the three borders red with blood, and the desolation urges the cold with snow for ten thousand miles. The voice of heaven has already moved the desert north, and my heart will be at peace when I return my rivers and mountains.</p>

<p>Chapter 9: Hearing the Bad News, People Are Like Flowers Falling into the Cesspool, and the Fragrant Traces Are Frequent, and the Heart Is Like Catkins Sticking to Mud</p>
<p>After twelve o'clock, Guoqi felt that the messenger would not come again. After eating lunch, he picked up a book and flipped through a few pages at random, which only added another layer of annoyance to his heart. The slight wind shook the bamboo curtains outside the window non-stop. From that action, the long-drawn sound of cicadas came from afar, rustling. When the strong white light of the sun shone into the courtyard, listening to the sound of cicadas gave a feeling of a very long day, and people felt sleepy and drowsy. So he moved a rattan chair and lay down facing the window. He didn't know how long it had been when he heard a few knocks by his ear. When he opened his eyes, he saw half a flowered dress outside the door curtain. He immediately stood up and nodded to the outside and said: Is it Ms. Li? Please come in. As he said this, he quickly took down the long gown on the hook and wanted to put it on. Aunt Liu outside the door replied: Sir, it's me. Guoqi had already put on his long gown. It was not good to take it off again and asked: What are you doing knocking on my door? Aunt Liu smiled and said: I am nailing two nails on the wall. Guoqi said: But it's good that you woke me up, I was just about to go out. As he said this, he rubbed his eyes and was about to lift the curtain to go out. Aunt Liu saw it from the crack in the door curtain and said: Sir, are you going out? There is a guest at home. Guoqi said: What guest is at home? Aunt Liu said: Miss Li came a long time ago and is sitting in the old lady's room. She said she wanted to borrow a book from you. If you wake up, just call him. Guoqi smiled and said: You don't speak clearly, which makes me confused. Go and tell Miss Li that if she wants any books, just come and get them. I'll wait here, I won't go out. Saying this, he felt a special kind of happiness and forgot all about blaming Youmei for breaking her promise. He touched his collar and pulled his lapel, and didn't sit down, quietly waiting for Youmei to come in. But Youmei's attitude was very gentle. After more than ten minutes, he first called out cousin across the door curtain, and then slowly lifted the door curtain and came in. Probably because of the heat, he didn't comb his long braids, but tied a butterfly bun on the top of his head. He was wearing a long light blue foreign gauze jacket. Although he was a muscular person, he also showed a slender figure. I don't know if he had applied rouge on his face, but two blushes had already appeared on his cheeks. When he came in, he smiled slightly at Guoqi and bowed: Cousin, didn't you go out today? (106)</p>

<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>As long as we think of the "January 28th" incident four years ago, none of us will forget Dachang, because Dachang and Miaohang were both important military locations at that time, so even now, the scars of the past catastrophe and the ruins after the war can still be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>At that time, I was also one of the survivors of the war, so for four or five years, that cruel and painful impression will never disappear from my memory; as long as I walk to those places, I will think of these things. Currently, the sound of cannons in Suiyuan is ringing again. The tricks that were performed in the south in the past have now been moved to the north in a different way. When we look back on the past, the new wounds and old pains all come to our hearts together.</p>
<p>On a day without sun, we were carried by the Shanghai-Tai long-distance bus, starting from Wuzhen Road Bridge, passing through Zhongxing Road, Taiyangmiao Road, Zhongshan Road, and finally climbing onto the long Shanghai-Tai Road; leaving the city and gradually moving towards nature. The rivers, farmhouses, and trees outside the car window retreated backwards like lightning.</p>
<p>When the car arrived at Dachang, we all got off in a crowd. It was the first time for all of us to come to Dachang, so we were not only unfamiliar with the route, but also a little unclear about the direction. But fortunately, we didn't have a specific destination, so we just let go of our steps and let our toes break through. We took a turn at the station, passed through an alley, and could see a cement bridge. That bridge was destroyed during the January 28th Incident and rebuilt by a gentleman's donation. Therefore, the bridge railings were all engraved with the cause of the destruction and the names of the donors. Walking down the bridge is Dachang Town.</p>
<p>Although the town market of Dachang is not very big, it is also quite prosperous, with taverns, sauce gardens, and firms. However, the town appearance does not seem to be very neat. We toured the street for a week and felt that the hotels and teahouses were not very deserted. After passing the town, a very high memorial archway stood at the end of the market, knowing that it was also built to commemorate the revitalization of the town.</p>
<p>Behind the town, there is a large farm. The farm covers an area of two or three hundred acres, with many seedlings and livestock types. Moreover, the shallow green lawns and the winding rivers are dotted with many pavilions, so although this is a farm, it also has the advantage of a garden. Especially in spring or summer, I believe that the living environment there must be very good!</p>
<p>Coming out of the farm, passing the security team headquarters, a group of team members were playing basketball. Behind the team headquarters, there is also a small garden, with a sign "Our Garden" erected on it.</p>
<p>Hearing the locals tell us that there is still an ancient Baohua Temple three or four miles away from the town, which is worth visiting. So we asked the locals for directions, and I arrived at Baohua Temple. The temple is indeed very large, with many monks, and it seems that the temple was rebuilt after the "January 28th" incident, so the houses still retain new traces. There are inscriptions by Mr. Wang Zhen, a native of Bailong Mountain, everywhere. Behind the temple, there is a courtyard, where there is a very large release pond and pavilions, as well as a river.</p>
<p>After visiting the temple, it was already dusk when I came back. But looking around the fields, I couldn't find my way home. Later, after passing through several field paths, I finally walked to Yuqing Bridge. I finally waited for the last Shanghai-Tai bus back to Shanghai at Yuqing Bridge and was taken back to Shanghai.</p>

<p>……Pale-faced scholars and delicate beauties, with their weak constitutions, are already outdated in the realm of love…Robust health is the sole prerequisite for heterosexual joy, to which young people must pay attention.</p>
<p>Health is the foundation of all endeavors and, even more so, the sole prerequisite for the joy of heterosexual love. Science tells us that only healthy individuals possess ample sexual function. With ample sexual function, one can engage in appropriate sexual activity to attain the supreme joy between the sexes. Consequently, humanity has altered the criteria for choosing partners, and the gaze of aesthetic appreciation.</p>
<p>The standard of male beauty in the old era was the pale-faced scholar, with a slender frame and lacking the strength to truss a chicken. The standard of male beauty in the new era is the magnificent man with a robust physique and well-developed muscles. The beauties of the old era were expected to be delicate and often sickly; now, they should be healthy and rosy-cheeked, with high breasts and shapely buttocks. The old style of beauty was very refined, but such men were often underdeveloped, with weak sexual function, suffering from conditions like nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and impotence, unable to satisfy their wives. Those sickly beauties were more likely to suffer from menstrual irregularities and sexual frigidity.</p>
<p>Sexual satisfaction is a natural, great desire of humanity. When such satisfaction is unattainable due to physical conditions, the affection between husband and wife will naturally not grow, the joy of heterosexual love cannot be achieved, and they live out their dreary lives in outward harmony but inner discord—this is the way of the weak. The strong resort to adultery or divorce, creating tragedies.</p>
<p>People with modern scientific knowledge are well aware of the importance of this issue, so they prioritize health when choosing a partner and judging beauty. A well-proportioned and robust physique indicates healthy reproductive glands. Healthy reproductive glands indicate sound and mature sexual function. Pale-faced scholars and sickly beauties are merely outwardly appealing and are no longer favored by discerning individuals. These unfortunate men and women must be rescued promptly, or they will have no chance to enjoy the love of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Let us first discuss the causes, which generally stem from congenital deficiency or acquired damage (masturbation or illicit sex), both resulting in weakened reproductive glands, inevitably halting development. Conditions like impotence, premature ejaculation, and localized smallness, as well as nocturnal emission, then emerge together; in women, this leads to menstrual irregularities, weak libido, or even its absence.</p>
<p>Such weakened men must quickly take "Hymitol Strengthening Pills," first to treat their nocturnal emissions, thereby regaining control over the ejaculatory function. Then, they should further take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to restore the reproductive glands to health. Impotence and premature ejaculation will surely be cured, development will resume, and the localized area will not remain small.</p>
<p>Women also have a female reproductive gland hormone preparation, "Female Reproductive Hormone," which can regulate menstruation, cure sexual frigidity, promote development, make breasts full and high, and complete a healthy and beautiful physique, eliminating deficiencies.</p>
<p>After being rescued by such scientific methods, the reproductive glands will be strong, internal secretions will be abundant, sexual function will not only be sound and vigorous, but overall health will also significantly increase, ensuring that one will not lag behind in the arena of love.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: "Reproductive Hormone" and "Hymitol Strengthening Pills" are generally packaged in iron boxes. Paper-boxed or bottled versions are counterfeit drugs. Please be careful not to purchase them.)</p>

<h3 id="e186">The Prerequisite for Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, MD, University of Pennsylvania</p>
<p>The treatment of gonorrhea has always been considered extremely difficult, mainly because even a slight oversight can lead to the risk of residual gonococci in the body. If the bacteria are not completely eradicated, acute gonorrhea will turn into chronic gonorrhea; furthermore, various complications may arise, or the sexual nerves may be damaged, leading to sexual neurasthenia, or the testicles may be damaged, leading to infertility. Therefore, before starting treatment, one must first consider how to achieve a radical cure, which is essentially a matter of choosing the right medication.</p>
<p>First, should we choose oral medication or injectable medication? In the past, injectable medication certainly had the upper hand, but its inconvenience in application is undeniable. If there is an excellent oral medication, it is always preferable. Patients can swallow it themselves; injection requires finding a doctor to administer it.</p>
<p>Then, the second question is how to choose an oral agent. We can put forward several standards to discuss.</p>
<p>Potency should be considered first. One must choose a drug that truly has the ability to kill gonococci. Mildness is also important; otherwise, side effects may occur. Finally, since it is an oral agent, it must not harm the stomach or intestines. The only drug that fully meets these standards is "Antilin," a compound preparation of flavin and vaccine. Its properties are mild, it does not harm the stomach or intestines, it certainly has the full ability to kill bacteria by penetrating membranes, and it can also produce antitoxins in the blood, increasing resistance, so its effectiveness is remarkable.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two kinds of supplementary drugs that should also be known. For sexual neurasthenia caused by gonorrhea, the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" can be taken. Female gonorrhea often involves vaginal discharge; the suppository "Leukorrhea Cure" can be used externally to eliminate leukorrhea and cleanse the vaginal tract.</p>

<p>(1) Impotence After Four Years of Masturbation</p>
<p>Patient Deng Yusi, 26 years old, from Wuxi, formerly a factory manager in a silk mill, residing in Caojiadu, Shanghai. (Chief complaint) – Started masturbating at the age of seventeen. As a young man with strong sexual desire, he inevitably indulged excessively, which led to many problems. Initially, he experienced nocturnal emissions and wet dreams. After a year, he developed symptoms such as headaches and tinnitus. By the spring of his nineteenth year, the condition became severe, with agitation and insomnia at night, and night sweats. He felt weak and tired, and even slight exertion caused dizziness. Although he knew he should quit masturbation, he found it difficult to stop completely until he got married at twenty-one. Unexpectedly, due to excessive marital activity, he suffered from premature ejaculation and impotence on his wedding night, with frequent nocturnal emissions. His complexion became increasingly pale, his muscles became thin, and his spirit declined severely. He sought various treatments, but the condition could not be cured. This spring, he came to seek treatment. (Symptoms upon examination) – Nocturnal emissions at least three times a week. The reproductive glands were severely weakened. The premature ejaculation and impotence were particularly severe. He had all kinds of neurasthenia symptoms and weighed only ninety pounds. (Treatment) – Diagnosed that Deng was completely suffering from the effects of masturbation, leading to laxity of the seminal vesicle and extreme weakening of the reproductive glands. He was given daily electrical stimulation therapy, strictly instructed on health maintenance, and separated from his wife. He took three "Hymitol Strengthening Pills" at night to treat nocturnal emissions. At the same time, he was given a large amount of the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone," taken twice each morning, noon, and evening to strengthen the weakened reproductive glands and increase internal secretion to restore healthy sexual function. After two months, the nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, impotence, and various weakness symptoms were eliminated, and his weight reached over one hundred pounds.</p>
<p>(2) Underdevelopment Due to Congenital Deficiency</p>
<p>Patient Tao Xingquan, 22 years old, (Chief complaint) – Due to congenital deficiency, he only started developing at eighteen, but development was poor, with a short penis and phimosis, but no masturbatory habits. Pale complexion, thin muscles, diminished sperm, weak brain, insomnia. Forgetfulness, nocturnal emissions at least twice a week, starting in August of this year, accompanied by his relative Sun Xiangyun for treatment. (Symptoms upon examination) – Poor nutrition, weak physique, developmental disorder, short genitalia, atrophied testicles and prostate gland, with tinnitus, headache, forgetfulness and other neurasthenia symptoms. (Treatment) – Daily electrical stimulation therapy, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to increase his internal secretion, promote his development, and eliminate his neurasthenia symptoms. "Hymitol Strengthening Pills" were used to treat his nocturnal emissions. In about two months, development improved, and all symptoms disappeared.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>My wife suffered damage to her stomach due to irregular eating habits and excessive consumption of cold drinks when she was young. She often felt unbearable pain and had a poor appetite. Recently, I saw advertisements for "Stomach Pain Relief" medicine, which is very effective for treating stomach pain, and "Digestive Aid" which can help digestion. I purchased one box of each from Wing On. After taking them, they were indeed effective. Not only did the pain stop and not recur, but her appetite also improved. (Da Quan)</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>My sister suffered from severe vaginal discharge for three years, sometimes better, sometimes worse, but never completely cured, so her health was poor. Fortunately, this summer, my cousin, Ms. Wang, recommended "Leukorrhea Cure" for external use, which can treat leukorrhea, and instructed her to take "Female Reproductive Hormone" to nourish her body. She purchased one box of each, and after taking them, the leukorrhea stopped immediately, and her body became healthy. (Shen Yinge)</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have always felt weak. After developing at sixteen, although my period came, my breasts were hard, flat, and now at nineteen years old, they are still withered and shrunken, which spoils my appearance. I saw an advertisement in the newspaper that "Female Reproductive Hormone" can develop breasts, so I took it for two months in a row. I gradually felt stronger, and my breasts were no longer as withered as before. This is truly a good medicine. (Dong Caiyun)</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Every year in winter, middle and upper-class families replenish their bodies with nourishing products, but I have noticed that my relative, Mr. Wang, purchases the Dali Reproductive Gland Hormone Preparation "Reproductive Hormone" every winter and takes it. Therefore, his health has been excellent in recent years. Not only is his complexion rosy and his body strong, but he can also maintain more than ten hours of complex work throughout the year without feeling tired. He has not suffered from any diseases throughout the four seasons. This is truly amazing. (Jin Liming)</p>
<p>Common Sense about Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3 id="e191">Report from a Successful Quit Smoking <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Yifei</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Half a year ago, I was a pale and skinny old smoker. I spent most of my time lying on my smoking bed, with a dim light shining on the yellow curtains, the gray face, and wisps of smoke. However, the promotion of the anti-smoking movement could not help but make me feel guilty. I remembered how teachers in school used to lecture us about the harm of smoking, and how I also deeply resented this harmful opium. I don't know how, after being a young master at home for a dozen years, I became addicted to this bad habit. Now, at just over thirty years old, I have been accompanied by this thing day and night for six years, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Filled with remorse, I resolved to quit. But I had always heard that quitting this thing requires enduring great pain, so I hesitated. Finally, with a burst of courage, I followed a prescription given by a Chinese medicine doctor and prepared a dose of medicine to take daily. At first, it was fine, but after ten days, I gradually felt uncomfortable all over. Gradually, I couldn't bear the pain, couldn't swallow, my complexion changed drastically, and I was bedridden. I had to resume smoking. After failing once, I became even more afraid. Recently, I heard that the nourishing quit smoking method has the characteristics of safety and painlessness, and the procedure is extremely simple, just by purchasing and taking "Reproductive Hormone." So, with an attitude of trying, I tried again. I stopped for only forty or fifty days and unconsciously quit, without feeling any pain. I was overjoyed. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Editor's note: Tobacco poison has a high degree of anesthesia, causing the body's tissues to lose vitality; the reproductive glands, the source of life, are so weakened that they are unable to promote the activity of all parts of the body. Only under the stimulation of tobacco poison can they be temporarily excited. Once smoking is stopped, the body's activities tend to stagnate, causing pain. Now, by taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone," the reproductive glands are strengthened, providing the vitality needed by all parts of the body, so there is no pain.</p>
<p>Enlightenment on Sexuality</p>

<h3 id="e192">The Harm of Masturbation for Men and Women <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>...Domestic medical experts have conducted little research on the period after which masturbation manifests its harms... Whenever abnormalities are found in a woman's private parts, it may be asserted that they are due to masturbation.</p>
<p>The harms of masturbation are usually referred to men, and it is not noted that young women experiencing burgeoning sexuality also masturbate, and their level of addiction even exceeds that of men. If women also have so-called self-touching behavior, then no matter what physiological differences there are, they cannot be spared the harms.</p>
<p>Although they also suffer the harms of self-touching, compared to men, the extent of the harm is relatively minor.</p>
<p>According to surveys, if a man who has just reached adulthood masturbates once a day, harm will arise in various parts of the body after three months. Conversely, if it is a woman, it will take at least six months for menstruation to become irregular. I think this is just an observation, and affirmation requires medical confirmation.</p>
<p>Domestic medical experts have conducted little research on the period after which masturbation manifests its harms. Although there are various investigations in foreign countries, they cannot be used for comparison because the physical constitution of each nation is different. However, it is undeniable that excessive masturbation in men can hinder localized development in youth, causing the outbreak of neurasthenia, nocturnal emissions, wet dreams, premature ejaculation, and impotence.</p>
<p>In women, excessive masturbation can easily cause menstrual irregularities and local damage. Whenever abnormalities are found in a woman's private parts, it may be asserted that they are due to masturbation. The most common abnormalities are rupture of the hymen, enlargement of the clitoris and labia, and excessive sensitivity of nerve endings. Gynecologists with extensive experience can immediately distinguish women who habitually self-touch by seeing that the clitoris and labia are particularly enlarged.</p>
<p>Regarding the most reliable treatments, in order to achieve the goal of eliminating diseases caused by masturbation in a short period of time, men's nocturnal emissions can be treated with "Hymitol Strengthening Pills." For neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, impotence, and hindered localized development, failure easily results from using anything other than the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone," as "Reproductive Hormone" is extracted from the essence of the reproductive glands of male animals, and it certainly has superior efficacy for various sexual diseases. As for women's menstrual irregularities and uterine disorders, they can be treated with "Female Reproductive Hormone."</p>

<h3 id="e193">Towering Breasts as a Symbol of Health and Beauty <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Modern women have abandoned their delicate and frail nature, and value healthy beauty. Health and beauty include many conditions, such as plump and firm skin, the balance of height and weight, a lively attitude, and prominent buttocks. But the most important point is breast beauty.</p>
<p>Breasts should be high, elastic, and subtly revealed under delicate, thin clothing, with a concave line in the middle and twin peaks rising on both sides, seemingly about to break through the clothing. The slight rise and fall during movement makes them appear more elastic. Heterosexuals are unconsciously attracted to them, which is arguably the most moving aspect of female beauty. However, only healthy people can have such beautiful breasts. Women with weak bodies and congenital deficiencies have insufficient reproductive gland secretions, making development difficult. How can breasts develop so fully?</p>
<p>Many women with flat and unhealthy breasts wear bras to deceive themselves, but when their clothes are thin or when they remove their robes, their ugly original form will be revealed immediately. It is good to rely on scientific medicine for remedies. "Female Reproductive Hormone," a female reproductive gland hormone preparation invented by Dr. Stanmore, is most effective in treating flat breasts. It can make the reproductive glands develop strongly, leading to the perfect development of the breasts, which rise high. As health improves, the skin becomes plump and firm, the curves are revealed, and the spirit is invigorated, becoming a very healthy and beautiful girl. But if one suffers from leukorrhea while being thin, one must also use "Leukorrhea Cure" externally as a suppository to cleanse the vaginal tract and achieve a radical cure.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Joint Pain that We Should Treat Early <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>To stay healthy year-round, one must strive to strengthen the body, invigorate the glands, and promote metabolism, thus increasing resistance. The disease most related to physical weakness is joint pain. The reason why this disease breaks out is almost entirely due to the internal accumulation of rheumatism and the uncleanness of the blood. In addition, excessive labor and arteriosclerosis can also cause this disease. If our daily hygiene is proper, so that the body gradually becomes stronger, the strong resistance will prevent rheumatism from invading, blood toxins from accumulating, work will not feel laborious, and the tissues of each part will be healthy, so that there is no risk of arteriosclerosis. All this is necessary for our pursuit of health. But to achieve the above goals, strong reproductive glands are necessary to produce unlimited internal secretions. Therefore, the reproductive hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" is the best medicine for our pursuit of health, because it certainly has the above-mentioned effects. If, unfortunately, daily prevention is neglected and joint pain breaks out, one should also take the highly effective "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills," because the combined medicinal power can dispel wind, remove dampness, cleanse the blood, and prevent arteriosclerosis, so the joints will feel relaxed immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Sai Jinhua is Dead <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Xin</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua is dead.</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua was once prominent for a time. As the saying goes, "Her reputation filled the nine cities, and everyone began to praise Second Master Sai." Sai Jinhua not only used charm to win the favor of adults and gentlemen, but also used boldness to make people "praise" her. More than thirty years ago, under feudal forces, she dared to break the boundaries between men and women without any scruples, and this boldness was enough to stun the close-minded.</p>
<p>But because of this, she was seen by some adults and gentlemen as a "strange costume" flaunting in the streets. The monster that will lead to the demise of the country.</p>
<p>The "upright" adults regarded her as a "monster that would lead to the demise of the country," and the reason was very simple: all old things, when they are about to decline and there is no way to remedy their decline, they always envy, resent, and thus want to destroy all new things. The new things that they initially opposed and destroyed may have direct conflicts of interest with the old, but over time, because they feel that there are more and more new things and they are becoming stronger and stronger, destroying them is really beyond their ability and there is no way to destroy them, so they have to close their eyes and ignore how chaotic they are, and because the greater new forces are no longer something they can destroy, they have to choose the weak to attack. The reason why new clothes were ridiculed as "strange costumes" was not really because of their "strangeness," but because they were "new."</p>
<p>Therefore, although the "upright" adults regarded her as a "monster that would lead to the demise of the country," the masses sympathized with her. Their sympathy was not because the masses had higher insights than the adults and gentlemen, knowing that the demise of the country had nothing to do with "strange costumes," and they would never turn their thoughts to "strange costumes." It was really because her boldness and her behavior of daring to resist traditional ideas stunned them, and they felt her loveliness intuitively. Although the masses were cowardly and dared not show resistance under the heavy pressure of thousands of years, they did have a psychology of worshipping resisters.</p>
<p>As for the fact that some self-proclaimed romantic adults and gentlemen liked her, it was also somewhat similar to this point. She was a</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Charming woman, but she was different from other women who only knew how to be charming. Other women had nothing else besides obedient obedience, but she also had the spirit of youth and dared to express her lively temperament. Thus, after the general self-proclaimed romantic adults and gentlemen became tired of the sentimental Lin Daiyu-style women, they liked her because of her novelty and stimulation. What's more, she also had the titles of "Imperial Envoy's Wife" and "Top Scholar's Wife." Once there is a title, it has been an example from ancient times to the present that they are regarded as rare commodities. Just say now, aren't "Empress" and "Campus Belle" more valuable than ordinary ones?</p>
<p>Naturally, the masses' unforgettable memory of her is also for a greater reason. This reason is to copy a line from the "Sai Jinhua" script: "In this time of great national change, it is not the great officials and mansions who can really speak for the people, but such a beautiful girl!" Because "such a beautiful girl" saved their lives, while those great officials and mansions were at a loss. Even if the masses were worse off, they would always know who gave them benefits and who gave them harm. Although after Sai Jinhua did not get much benefit from the masses.</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua was one who was able to prolong her life in troubled times by accidentally taking the enemy's favor with her body. Because of this accidental opportunity, she was able to "sell a little face" and beg the enemy for mercy for the people. Moreover, because of the internal contradictions of the various imperialist powers, she was considered to have fulfilled a "meritorious service" that the ministers could not fulfill for Empress Dowager Cixi. (Please do not forget that this "meritorious service" was exchanged for twelve humiliating national treaties, including an indemnity of 450 million taels of silver and the prohibition of setting up military defenses on the road from Tianjin Dagu to Beijing!) This is not worth emulating. Now that Sai Jinhua is dead, has the era of Sai Jinhua also died with Sai Jinhua's death? This is worth savoring.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Wool Sweaters <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Jia</p>
<p>The children in the alley have all put on wool sweaters, looking quite dashing sitting on their little tricycles. My four-year-old son secretly said to his mother that he wanted a wool sweater too. At the time, I didn't know what my wife said to answer her little darling.</p>
<p>Children always like to play in the alley. If one child in the group has a new toy or wears a new piece of clothing, the others will also want the same toy and clothing. This may be a characteristic of the alley I live in. There was a time when every child in this alley had an aviator cap. A friend came to see me and said that this alley had the air of an aviation school. This also shows that children like to be part of a group.</p>
<p>I don't know when it started, but tricycles became popular in the alley again. This toy is not as good as other things. For example, playing with a rubber ball or kicking shuttlecock is just dividing into two teams and competing to win or lose. Now it is a competition of who can ride their tricycle the fastest. As a result, quarrels often occur in the alley. Everyone has a desire to win, but playing with a rubber ball or kicking shuttlecock only results in the losing team wanting to play again, and the winning team shouting slogans happily. In the end, everyone enjoys themselves. But racing tricycles can lead to trouble. Riding fast can indeed take the lead, but if you can't control the handlebars, there is still a risk of hitting the wall. Moreover, if one tricycle derails, it will block another one. Therefore, when they can't make friends anymore, everyone abandons their tricycles and starts fighting.</p>
<p>After my child bought an aviator cap, he naturally wanted a tricycle as well, but I didn't allow him to. My reason for refusing him was that this thing would cause trouble. Maybe I'll buy him a foreign doll to play with in the future. The child is a good child. He doesn't understand the lies of adults. He is just dreaming a dream, a dream of a foreign doll.</p>
<p>Of course, the foreign doll has not been bought yet. Every day he sees me go out, he quietly asks me: "Dad, are you going to buy a foreign doll today?" I know he doesn't bluntly question me: "Dad, why haven't you bought a foreign doll yet!" because he's afraid I'll hit him. Seeing his pitiful appearance like that, a father is not a heartless snake after all. I nod and promise him that I will definitely buy one tonight. But when I get home, I only bring a few candies or a bag of candied chestnuts to coax him to have another good dream.</p>
<p>This time he wants a wool sweater, but he doesn't ask me. He asks his mother. The child is also a smart child. He has already seen through that his father is not a good person. If he thinks tricycles will cause trouble, does he also fear that foreign dolls will plot to kill for money? However, besides being able to hug him and tell him a story, his mother is just as good at lying as his father, and her lying skills are even better than his father's.</p>
<p>When I went out, the child was in the alley again. He stood at the foot of the wall on the sunny side, enviously watching his companions racing tricycles wearing wool sweaters. He didn't have either. The heroic appearance of the other children further accentuated his resemblance to a defeated rooster quietly kicked out of the circle by them. Seeing me come out, he ran over and grabbed my clothes, walking with me for a while. Only at the entrance of the alley did he ask me to buy a bag of candied chestnuts when I come back.</p>
<p>I coaxed him to go home, saying that his father would buy good things when he returned. With this wish in mind, I walked past many department stores, all of which were having big winter sales, but I couldn't find a wool sweater that I wanted to buy in my heart. On the way home, I bought an extra pear at the fruit store next to the candied chestnuts stand.</p>
<p>The child happily accepted these two good things. While eating, leaning against his mother's chest, he said to himself: "Dad will buy a wool sweater tomorrow."</p>
<p>I glanced at him, and my wife also glanced at him.</p>
<p>That night I read a few pages of a book, and suddenly remembered that there was still an old wool sweater of mine at the bottom of the chest. Taking it apart and knitting a sweater for the child would be more than enough. I told my wife, and she agreed, but she said that I should buy a new one for myself.</p>
<p>The next day, the wool was taken apart and washed. After being stretched on bamboo poles and dried in the sun, the child jumped around, touching it with his dirty hands, because his wife told him that the wool would be ready to knit a wool sweater for him after it was dry.</p>
<p>In a couple of days, the wool sweater was on the child's body. I opened the window, wanting to see his joy as he rejoined that group of children. Children should be allowed to move and live in their own world. But he was standing at the foot of the wall on the sunny side, still lacking a tricycle!</p>
<p>When my wife also leaned over, I closed the window.</p>
<h3 id="e197">People in Cages <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— San San</p>
<p>—Prisoners of Guizhou</p>
<p>In the morning, when the shy sun sparingly casts its rays through the iron windows, many eyes will open, peering through the gaps in the "cage bars" and the iron window frames, affectionately looking at that small patch of daylight.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of another day.</p>
<p>As usual, the prison guard's assistant (we call him "the key holder") will come at this time to open the door and send a "watchman" out to call for water. During this period, the "gentlemen" in the "middle cage" have the opportunity to take a walk on the outside lawn.</p>
<p>Because they (the gentlemen) have money—giving several tens of dollars to the prison guard, several dollars to "the key holder," and another one or two dollars to several "watchmen"—they can reside in the "middle cage."</p>
<p>The "middle cage" is different from the "inner cage" in several ways. First, this place is relatively spacious and closer to the window. Second, only in the middle cage can one sleep on a high bed. Third, the prison guards treat them differently, allowing them to bring relatives and friends into the cage to talk with them. And fourth, they have longer "exercise" time.</p>
<p>What about the people in the "inner cage"? They are packed seven or eight to a cage. This cage is only about two square yards in size, surrounded on all sides by wooden bars as thick as small bowls (we call them "cage bars"). Only a few threads of sky can be vaguely seen through the gaps in the bars. Even on sunny days, it is still "dark and dismal" inside. Added to this are those dark, thin faces, making it seem little different from hell. The ground is dirt, always damp, and the people only use a straw mat or a few stalks of rice straw to sleep on. In the corner of the cage, a filthy bucket, even taller and bigger than a water bucket, emitting a foul odor, always accompanies them.</p>
<p>In hot weather, strings of bedbugs, crawling incessantly from the "cage bar" gaps, climb onto people's bodies, onto vegetables, and into the food. Moreover, they are not "nocturnal." No matter what time it is, if you don't spend a large amount of time fighting them, you won't get temporary peace. For one person, catching a hundred bedbugs every day</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>is an easy task.</p>
<p>In cold weather, lice replace the bedbugs, attacking them.</p>
<p>The people in the cages, except for the very poor, provide for their own meals, either sent from home or by entrusting the watchmen to buy rice and vegetables and cook for themselves.</p>
<p>The penniless ones receive two or three cylinders of red unpolished rice (about two small bowls) from the prison every day, which doesn't expand much when cooked. Cooking dry rice can only yield three or four bowls, which of course cannot satisfy their needs for two meals. But they have no choice but to use some of it to exchange for water, coal, and vegetables. The remaining rice is only used for cooking porridge, with no other option. Year after year, they prolong their lives in thin porridge.</p>
<p>Every newcomer is locked in the inner cage. If his background is better, the prison guard will treat him as a "fat pig." If this "fat pig" doesn't know his place, beatings and shackles will be added to him, and he will even be forbidden from having his family send him food until he takes out money. Those who can only come up with five yuan will remain in the inner cage, and all they get is a cessation of abuse. Those who can come up with ten yuan or more can move to the middle cage.</p>
<p>Every new prisoner also has to be controlled by the "cage head" (the most senior and powerful person). You also have to give him some money, otherwise, he will torment you, make you sleep next to the toilet, and make you responsible for emptying the bucket every day.</p>
<p>The prison guards and "key holders" can beat and scold prisoners, needless to say. Even those watchmen who guard the prisoners in the cages (they live in the middle cage), if you don't give them some benefits, they will also reprimand you and prevent you from going outside to buy things.</p>
<p>Every day, from two o'clock to four o'clock, is the time for the prisoners to see the daylight. The key holder will release them into the outside open space.</p>
<p>Although this "exercise" time is stipulated by the yamen (government office), if the key holder is in a bad mood, it's useless, even if he doesn't let them exercise for several days. He doesn't care if the dung bucket overflows.</p>
<p>In the darkness, on the damp ground, in the foul air, and under the attack of bedbugs and lice, the underfed people are constantly getting sick and weakening, weakening... until the day they pray for (the day of their release) arrives, they are like birds locked up for a long time, finding it difficult to spread their wings.</p>

<p>Cao Xiaoying "Jade Dragonfly"</p>
<p>Sino-Western (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Palace Complaint"</p>
<p>The Western Palace is quiet at night, and hundreds of flowers are fragrant. Wanting to roll up the beaded curtain, one can't fight the endless hate. The imperial concubine sits alone on the agarwood couch. Burning red candles to await the king. Gao Lishi. Go tell the imperial concubine. Tonight, His Majesty is lodging in Zhaoyang Palace. Taizhen felt gloomy when she heard this. Wearily removing her makeup. Laying down on the mandarin duck quilt with her clothes on. Seeing a round bright moon shining on the palace wall. Sleeping lonely on a cold pillow, feeling sad and shedding tears. I advise people not to accompany the king. Accompanying the king is like accompanying a tiger. Thinking of the empress, what a beautiful face. Why was I abandoned on the sidelines? It's better to marry a romantic son. Enjoying pleasure morning and night. The crape myrtle flower facing the crape myrtle lover.</p>
<p>He Yunfang and He Qinfang "Double Pearl Ball"</p>
<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Xiaoxiang Asking About Sickness"</p>
<p>The vast twilight gradually turns yellow. A rustling breeze and drizzling rain. In the dark, the sound of Xiaoxiang is lonely. The thin bamboo shadows are silent. Master Yihong is an affectionate person. Thinking of the melancholic and sickly person. Putting on his bamboo hat and raincoat. Holding a lamp, he hurriedly walks to the garden. Walking to Xiaoxiang Hall. The girl just finished writing a poem and put down her pen. The maid suddenly reports that the Second Master has arrived. Only to see that his attire today is different from before. Brother Dou, why are you imitating a fisherman? The young master hears this and asks with concern. Is my sister's body at peace? Taking medicine and eating more, she should not write poetry recently. I am always worried. Therefore, I braved the rain to inquire clearly. If my sister likes this attire. I will send you a set on a good day. Pinqing replied, why is this needed? The image of a fisherwoman is truly worthless. Speaking these words, she secretly pondered, and should not have mentioned fisherman and fisherwoman. Peach blossom face flushes with shame, hard to hide. Silently bowing her head, she says nothing. One is unintentionally saying the wrong thing. One is not knowing love until its budding. The dream of the Red Chamber is full of changes. Briefly showing that, the paragraph where Xiaoxiang asks about sickness. Resenting the old man of the moon for not tying the threads of love. Therefore, medicine has no effect. In vain, two hearts.</p>
<p>Opening "New Qingwen Mending Fur"</p>
<p>Jiang Binchu "Three Smiles"</p>
<p>New Voice (1380) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "New Qingwen Mending Fur"</p>
<p>The moon hides its light, ashamed of its smallness. Qingwen is most elegant and romantic. With one glance, love runs deep for Baoyu. Truly, steel refined a hundred times becomes soft around the finger. Truly praise her, the virgin is more secluded than the flower. Deeply fearing the god of spring would feel depressed. Alone, she tightly embraces the orchid late into the night. Exhausting her strength and risking her life to mend the sparrow fur. Most pitiable, guarding her body like jade, she is slandered. Erroneously earning a false name, she has no control over her fate. Regretting from before. Never serving in the bedchamber. Comparable to that, the sound of "River Full" tears the liver and intestines. Biting off her green fingernail, she remembers. Treasure it closely, god of spring, and collect it carefully. The beauty is damaged, the son mourns. Clumps of disarrayed weeds hide the girl's mound. Yihong is truly an affectionate person. Quietly waiting for a good name, sighing endlessly. Wu'er mistakenly loves...</p>

<h3 id="e201">"With One Heart and Soul" in Nanjing <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>"With One Heart and Soul" began its test screening at the Xindu Theater in Nanjing on the 3rd, and the audience was very enthusiastic. On the evening of the test screening, many Nanjing reporters, writers, filmmakers, and socialites attended. Tian Han also accompanied his wife and beloved daughter Mary to visit. The playwright Hua Han was busy entertaining, attracting much attention from the audience.</p>
<p>The Nanjing newspapers competed to publish special issues. Xinmin Bao, Nanjing Daily, Ren Bao, Hua Bao, and Rotary Daily all mobilized their supplements to write articles recommending it. The Nanjing Daily even prepared a "Daily Movie" supplement and is currently planning a "With One Heart and Soul" reader symposium to specifically discuss the plot and performance of the film.</p>
<p>Mr. Tian Han wrote a large article in the Xinmin Bao introducing the film, saying: "At a time when various imperialists are vigorously preparing for the Second World War, when the Spanish warlords are colluding with fascist countries to drive Moorish troops and Kazakh troops to slaughter innocent people in the country, when the Chinese warlords, under the command of the 'friendly' military headquarters, are conducting a shameless war on the edge of Daqingshan, seeing the film 'With One Heart and Soul,' which is based on the heroic and moving story of the Chinese people enduring hardships and organizing the anti-imperialist and anti-warlord struggle, is very inspiring..."</p>

<h3 id="e203">Chen Qixia and Female Students <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>"Female Students" is a brilliant work co-directed by Shao Zuiweng and Wen Yimin after "On the Banks of the Huangpu River." It is also the second film starring the newcomer Chen Qixia. Since the public release of "On the Banks of the Huangpu River," everyone has generally recognized that Chen Qixia has a talent for acting, and in "Female Students," she has made even more rapid progress.</p>
<p>The male lead in "Female Students" is Tao Jin. He is the mainstay of the China Travel Theater. He first co-starred with Chen Qixia in "On the Banks of the Huangpu River," and already had very good results. This second collaboration will naturally not disappoint us either.</p>
<p>In "On the Banks of the Huangpu River," Chen Qixia played a commoner girl, while in "Female Students," she plays an aristocratic girl. She can play these two different types of personalities just right.</p>
<p>We can believe that after the public release of "Female Students," Chen Qixia's position on the screen will not only increase but also be established.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Great Evening News Children's Friendship Association Performs "Ancient Temple Bells" <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Children's Friendship Association, launched by the Great Evening News, has been preparing for several months. It is now reported that the founding meeting is scheduled for 9:30 AM on the 13th of this month at the Carlton Theater on Park Road. In addition to singing and dancing performances and the children's song singing by the Shamei Children's Choir, there is also the Children's Friendship Association drama group's "Ancient Temple Bells." The playwright and director of this drama is Mr. Xu Xingzhi. It has been rehearsing for a month since the beginning, so it is predicted that the results will be satisfactory. According to the large-scale public performance of children's drama, it is still the first time in the history of the Chinese drama movement, and all parties are paying close attention to this drama.</p>
