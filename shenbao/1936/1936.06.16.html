<h3>撤消對意制裁問題</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>自從意大利於上月宣布吞併整個的阿比西尼亞後國際聯盟就遭遇到一個空前的危機這危機就是國聯對於意國以武力所造成的事實還是予以默認呢還是予以阻止如果予以承認那不啻自打耳光要是繼續維持對意經濟制裁則又為事實所不許在這十字街頭上國聯便陷入非常苦悶的境界現在國聯行政院特別會議以及因阿根廷之提議而召集之國聯特別大會已定於月底先後舉行關於對意制裁問題是再也不能不謀得一個解决的辦法了</p>
<p>國聯將怎樣解救它所遭遇的空前危機呢換句話說國聯是預備加緊對意制裁還是撤消經濟制裁呢要說明這個問題就不得不先考察英國政府的態度如何因為國聯的對意實施經濟制裁大部可說是由英國發動的自從意國宣布吞併阿國後英國政府除了少數閣員外是贊成撤消經濟制裁的不過因為輿論勢力的强大還不敢有明顯的决定現在則因時局的發展政府中的撤消制裁派顯已佔了優勢這我們可從下面幾點事實看出來　前外相霍爾的重入內閣擔任海相霍氏為有名的親意派去年曾與法總理拉伐爾草就瓜分阿國的和平建議後以受輿論的攻擊而下台此次霍氏重入內閣的條件據云卽為撤退地中海上的英國艦隊　六月十日財相張伯倫公開演說中張撤除對意經濟制裁張氏為內閣中的重要人物頗有繼鮑爾特溫而任首相之望其言自可代表政府的大部意見此外主張撤消經濟制裁的政府要人也頗不少現在不但英國有中止對意制裁之意就是其他各會員國如智利阿根廷捷克等國也有同樣的傾向所以本月底國聯大會之將决定撤消對意制裁現在已可說是大部决定了</p>
<p>國聯之將撤消對意制裁的根本原因是由於帝國主義者的自私自利不肯擁護弱小民族的利益不過意大利的嚴重威脅也是個重耍原因意國駐英大使格蘭第曾於六月九日訪問英國外務次官謂國聯經濟制裁之實施本所以謀遏止意阿戰爭而現在戰爭旣已結束制裁自失其目標如果國聯仍於本月底决定維持經濟制裁則意國必宣布退出國聯而這却是英法等國所極不願意的同時意國遝準備動員八十萬軍隊及宣傳與德國締結軍事同盟密的等手段來威脅英法之取消對意的經濟制裁</p>
<p>但是國聯就將因意大利的嚴重威脅而完全無條件地屈服嗎這是不會的因為英國也是要面子的現在日內瓦所預定扮演的悲喜劇就是一方面撤消對意制裁的實施而另一方面則仍决定不承認意國吞併阿比西尼亞的合法同時還澦備修改國際聯盟的盟的以免將來再有同樣事實的發生這樣的把戲當然是我們愛好和平的民衆所不歡喜看的英國擁護國聯各團體聯合會已於十四日開會反對撤消對意經濟制裁英工黨首領阿德里也發表同樣的反對演說以後演變的程度如何我們惟有靜待事實的告訴罷</p>

<h3>日本軍部計畫　充實空軍力對俄　議設專部發展民間航空　誇大宣傳蘇聯擴張軍備</h3>
<p>（東京）民間航空事業於戰事發生之際、卽爲空軍第二軍、已屬過去見解、蘇俄以民間航空本身卽爲空軍、積極準備實現此計劃、據聞全國人民空軍化事業、業於去年度收容一千八百萬人、全國兵士百分之九爲空軍預備敎育修業者、飛機製造工塲約達七十、每年製造能力不下二千五百架、日本陸軍省因蘇聯航空如斯發達、雖盡全力充實陸海軍航空隊、絕對無希望獲得近代戰爭勝利、决意積極强化國防、擴張民間航空、經種種硏究之結果、達到結論、新設如航空省或航空院之一大機關、積極援助民間航空事業之發達、現與海軍當局恊議中、俟得海軍同意後、連名提出閣議要求承認、（十五日同盟社電）</p>
<h3>明年度陸海軍預算　鈄突壞十四萬萬元</h3>
<p>（東京）日政府各省前正依據臨時議會之决議或建議、草擬明年度預算案，準備提出七月三日之閣議審核、注意時局者對於海陸軍兩方面之國防預算、均極爲關心、據息、陸軍方面因鑒於目前國際情形、有樹立綜合國防政策之擬議、故明年度國防預算將達七億元之鉅、企圖在今後四年或六年之內、完成强化之國防軍備、其第一步之工作、係以增强在「滿」兵力及充實航空及防空設備、强化對俄作戰能力爲目標、至海軍方面、卽將建造主力艦、整備航空力、擴充水陸軍備、進行南進政策爲主眼、其預算額亦須突破七億元之譜云、（十五日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）據東京朝日讀賣兩新聞傳、蘇俄最近不絕其侵略行為、日本陸軍應增加戰力、以北滿爲國防第一綫、保持日俄平等實力後、設立非武裝區域、而要求蘇聯撤退其軍、該兩報同時載陸軍對此問題之意見如下、</p>
<p>陸軍當局確信使蘇聯拋棄其挑戰行爲之最善手段、爲充實日本軍備、現正積極整備軍力中、俄「滿」國境設立五十啟羅非武裝地帶、日「滿」軍及蘇聯軍均由該地帶撤退其兵、</p>
<p>蘇聯口稱不侵犯條約、而在一方面在國境建設要塞、集結軍隊、日本熟知蘇俄眞意不能在此一片條約、求得安全感念、　如非武裝地域成立、則日滿蘇俄間各種懸案極易解决、</p>
<p>蘇俄遠東政策中、最重要者爲在遠東獲得不凍軍港、而以遠東赤化爲赤化世界之基礎、</p>
<p>日軍非有日皇大命、不動一兵故絕無由日軍挑戰等事、陸軍應充實國防以備萬一事件、陸軍以强力軍備為背景、調整俄滿關係、則易解决國境諸事件、（十五日同盟電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）下議院本日午後開會時、艾登外相或當發表演說、涉及對意制裁問題、至英國政府關於此項問題之確定態度、非俟下星期一日下議院討論外交政策時、不致切實加以說明、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國政府對於撤消對意制裁一項問題、行當有所行動、此層殆已確定無疑、晨郵報外交記者宣稱、「英國內閣本星期三開會時、對於下列兩項問題、定必採取確切决定、此項問題卽　撤消對意制裁、　改組國聯會、而减小其現有職權是也、惟以上兩項辦法一旦决定之後艾登外相能否離續供職、則殊爲可疑耳、孟却斯德保衛報外交記者關於此層雖抱同樣觀念、但明白採取保留態度、其言曰、「英國政府之態度、在星期三舉行閣議之前、自應視爲尙未正式决定、至在國聯會行政院本月二十六日召開非常會議時、各國對於撤銷對意制裁辦法一項問題、若均不願提出建議、則英國代表自當提議結束制裁辦法、或組織委員會、重行研究制裁問題、此層較爲可信」此外關於改組國聯會辦法、該報亦發表評論、以爲此層當以下列兩項原則爲依據、卽　分區組織安全機構、　訂立地中海公約、而由意國居主要地位、並謂撤消制裁辦法、與意國參加地中海公約、兩者之間、並無交換條件可言、最後該報對於外傳英國在地中海方面原有地位業已削弱、亦認爲不確、但謂英國或當整頓原有地位、馬爾泰島形勢已非昔比、或當在其他不易受敵攻擊之地、例如另設海軍根據地、以爲替代、此外並當在南菲洲聯邦開浦城、增闢海軍根據地、以爲通至印度之新路綫云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日東亞局長　桑島到平後之談話</h3>
<p>承認冀東偽組織應取銷　但又謂日無侵略中國意</p>
<p>北平通訊、日本外務省東亞局長桑島主計、十三日晚由津抵平、下榻北京飯店一〇八號、十四日午正、冀察政委會委員長宋哲元、特假頤和園南海飯店設宴、招待桑島、及前任日本參謀次長杉山元、津日駐屯軍司令部參謀長永見俊德、駐屯軍部附松室孝良、並邀秦德純·張自忠·王揖唐·馮治安·劉汝明·等軍政要人作陪、約二時始散、宴後舉行遊園、三時許、陸續返城、永見當日下午五時返津、桑島定十五日與宋氏正式會見、懇談一切、十六日淸晨、赴張家口視察、當晚返平、十七日轉赴濟南·靑島、分訪韓復榘沈鴻烈等、然後赴京滬、分別拜訪我政府各要人、事畢後、由滬乘輸回國、記者於十四日晨九時半、往訪桑島於北京飯店、談約一小時許、茲紀其談話如左「本人前在天津任職（按係津日總領）二年有半、嗣奉調回國、在外務省供職、仍辦東亞事宜、惟以事繁、始終未能離任、故迄今已三年整、不曾來華、在此二年期內、中國變動不少、情形亦不甚相同、此决來華、卽爲看看中國情形、有何變動之處、以便爲將來辦事之參考、本人此行預定要到的地方、爲河北·天津·北平·張家口·濟南·靑島·南京·上海。等地、考察完畢、卽行返國、</p>
<p>余到津後、曾晤田代司令官·永見參謀長·津日總領事館人員·及在津之中國舊日友好、所談者多爲河北最近情况、在北平亦希望能有暇多見數人、愈見的人多、聽到的意見亦必愈多、與宋委員長大約於十五日可正式會晤、至華北時局問題、究應至何種程度、及如何方能解决、因本人尙僅晤及一部份友朋、政委會各位、均未曾晤及、故暫無何意見發表、甚是抱歉、惟余思不但華北、卽中國政府亦應謀人民幸福、及人民生活安定、日政府對中國政府爲此種事努力之時、定能予以帮助、余並以爲卽中日外交、亦應以謀人民幸福·及人民生活安定·爲標準、此余對華北大致之感想、將來得到詳細情時、當更有具體之意見、</p>
<p>據以上所述、似嫌抽象與空虛、然余在津任職時、卽有此種戚想、例如河北爲產棉之區、而日本紡紗廠、需耍此種原料甚多、向皆來自英·美·埃及、卽以中國棉種不良之故也、中日爲隣近之國、如中國改良棉種、則日本自當採購、如此於人民生活安定上、亦必多帮助、日本在經濟上、且可予以恊助、現中國已有植棉救國等標語、並聞中國目前且已有棉花出口、日本亦有用者、此實艮好之現象、又如山西爲水利不便之省、如能興辦水利、自可發展農產、余在滿時、有挖井工程司淸水、因閻鍚山先生之請、由余介紹、前往工作後、現聞山西水井、已挖有的三百口、此於山西農民利益甚大、而日方亦不無利益、</p>
<p>至於華北外交、因華北地方爲中國之地方、在原則上應由中國政府辦理、然因日方對華北之認識、與中國政府稍有不同、至日軍部與外交者對華北政策、並無分別、蓋日政府卽係一貫之政策、以此政策來應付華北情勢、雖華北有特殊的情形、但辦外交之宗旨、並無二致、固不必分由外務省、或軍部負責也、華北地方特殊、變化甚速、如中央有辦法、其情形亦不致有如今者、故此責任、乃係中國當局之責任、」</p>
<p>桑島言至此、記者詰以所指華北特殊情形之特殊處何在、桑島謂、「余因無暇長談、謹簡言之、卽爲日本現係祖任「滿洲國」國防責任、並担負「滿洲國」政治·文化·經濟·開發之責任、而「滿洲國」與中國交界之處、卽爲華北、故言其情形特殊、卽在於此、」</p>
<p>記者再詢以冀東問題、是否有解决可能、桑島謂、「關於此事余僅發表個人意見、冀東組織、在原則上應與冀察政委會合流、應予取銷、不能永久存在」惟何時始能合流、及至何種程度、始能取銷、現在尙待研究、刻尙未能有所發表、日本增加華北駐屯軍、余相信無一點侵略中國之意、談到調整中日兩國關係問題、此一句話關係重大、兩國時時刻刻均在研究之中、余相信兩國關係、非調整不可、而且一定能調整、今願聽諸位對於調整關係之高見、記者當說明吾人亦卽全國人民、對於調整中日關係之意見固多、今因限於時間、僅以最要之一點以貢參考、卽希望舉凡一切中日間之問題、均應以外交方式、合法手續進行解决、以期達到眞正之中日親善與合作、如訴諸武力、則中國土地之廣、人口衆多、完全征服、實非易易、桑島對此、亦表示接受之意、謂願彼此在顧全立塲與事實之原則上、互相努力諒解、（十四日）</p>

<h3>兒童敎育與救國運動（二）</h3>
<p>市敎局長潘公展在中央電臺講</p>
<p>我們如果眞能照着這個敎育宗旨做去、達到「充實人民生活、扶植社會生存、發展國民生計、征續民挨生命」的目的、使民族眞能獨立，民權眞能普遍、民生眞能發展、敎育也便已盡了救國的能事、本來、總理說「三民主義就是救國主義」主義只能宗於一、我們現在旣以惟一的三民主義救國、建國治國、敎育是不能跳到國家繁圍以外的、當然也只能宗於這惟一的一二民主義、而不能兼容其他主義、可見三民主義的敎育、的確就是救國敎育、並且是惟一的救國敎育、我們又何必另翻新花樣呢、</p>
<p>再就小學敎育目標說、我們中國的小學敎育、總目標是「小學應根據三民主義、遂照中華民國敎育宗旨及其實施方針、發展兒童身心、培養國民道德基礎、及生活所必需的基本知識和技能、以養成知禮知義愛國愛民的國民」、更就這總目標的分析說、是「培養兒童健康的體格、陶冶兒童良好的品性、發展兒童審美的興趣、增進兒童生活的知能、訓練兒童勞動的習慣、啟發兒童科學的思想、培養兒童互助團結的精神、養成兒童愛國愛羣的觀念」、這樣的敎育目標、本來也非常切合當今國難環境的需要、我們如果眞能照着道個目標做去、達到那目標所規定的一切、使現在的兒童將來都成爲健全的國民、也早已盡了敎育的職事、又何必另翻新花樣呢、</p>
<p>更就小學公民調練目標說、我們中國的小學公民訓練目標、是以發揚中國民族固有的道德、以忠·孝·仁·愛·信·義·和·平·爲中心、並採取共他各民族的美德而制定、分析起來、便是「養成整潔衛生的習慣、快樂活潑的精神、禮義廉恥的觀念親愛精誠的德性、節儉勞動的習慣、生產台作的知能、奉公守法的觀念、愛國愛羣的思想」、這樣的訓練目標、無疑地又是非常切合當今國難環境的需要的、我們如果眞能照着這個目標做去、達到那目標所規定的一切使現在的兒童將來都成爲健全的公民、還不是已盡敎育的能事、本來、總理又說、「我們要恢復民族的地位、除了大家聯合起來做成一個民族團體以外、就要把固有的道德、恢復起來、有了固有的道德、然後固有的民族地位、才可以恢復」、那末發揚民族固有道德、並兼採其他民族美德而判定的公民訓練目標、當然就是恢復民族地位的訓練目標、所謂恢復民族地位、就是復興民族、使能永久獨立生存於世界、</p>
<p>我們根據如上所說的一切、深覺中國的敎育、無論在宗旨上看、在目標上看、以及其他任何方看、最後的目的、原是爲求民族生存、實施敎育者、如果眞能切切實實照着宗旨和目標做去、自然能達到復興民族的目的、因之、我個人以爲國難愈嚴重、小學敎育者愈應努力、所應努力的並不在另翻新花樣、而在切切實實照着原訂的敎育宗旨和目標做去、透一些實際的效能出來、（完）</p>

<h3>軍用毒氣略說</h3>
<p>— 姚星叔</p>
<p>戰爭中利用毒氣，使敵人喪失戰鬥力及防禦力的事實，由來已久。但具體化的應用，是在一九一四年歐洲大戰，德國首開其紀元。普通人對於軍用毒氣，都懐着非常的恐懼，其實我們對於軍用毒氣，固然不可輕視，但盲目的恐懼心，也要打破，庶幾臨時能够鎭靜，不致驚惶失措，從容的力謀相當的防禦計劃，避免大部分的損害。</p>
<p>軍用毒氣的名稱，揆諸實際，殊欠適當：因其所應用的物質，除去幾種之外，並不都是氣體，有的是沸點很高的液體或固體，以之貯入開花彈內，在彈爆炸開，變成霧狀或灰塵狀而彌散：所以把他改稱爲化學軍用品，較爲合理。</p>
<p>戰時應用毒氣的目的，當然是使敵人與之接觸後，身體受傷，失去戰鬭力，强逼其退出駐守的地帶。其侵害身體的部分，不外乎眼，鼻，喉之粘膜，肺部及皮膚等處。</p>
<p>化學上的一切毒質，不能都拿來做軍用毒氣，例如我們所熟知毒性劇烈的一氣化炭（冬季煤球中毒，卽係此物），靑酸，軍事上並不採用。凡爲軍用者，必具有幾種理化學的幾種特性。</p>
<p>現在把幾種重耍的毒氣，槪括說明如下：</p>
<p>（一）光氣Phosgene係唯一在平常溫度下早氣體之毒質，無色，具特別之臭氣，不能久存於濕空氣內，毒性最烈，專門侵襲肺臟。易致人死命，每一立方粎空氣內，含有四十五　光生氣時，已能使人生命危險。一秒鐘內。若吸入三·五兞之本品，立卽送命。普通之防毒面罩，可以防禦其侵襲：因其內裝有吸本品的藥劑。若噴洒滷精水，亦能迅速的毀滅之。本品受了空氣內潮濕（卽水分）的影響，卽起分解作用，毒性消失。</p>
<p>（二）重光氣Diphosgene在平常溫度時，爲無色液體，純粹品加熱至攝氏一百二十度，卽分解爲光生氣，毒性與光生氣相等，性牢固，揮發較難，在地面上能數小時不散去，亦不生變化，對於呼吸器的作用，與光生氣同，且帶催淚性。普通之防毒罩，得防其侵襲，以滷精水或炭酸鈣溶液噴洒，能完全毀滅之。</p>
<p>（三）氣苦味質Chlorpikrine　以漂白粉與苦味酸合成，爲無色之油狀液體，不溶液於水，沸點爲攝氏一百十二度，軍隊中稱之嘔吐氣，性牢固，在地面上經久不散。其蒸氣對於角膜，鼻及咽喉之粘膜，有强烈之侵蝕作用。一立方粎空氣內，有十九　之本品，卽令人流淚，達六十　，人則不能忍受，昏暈，嘔吐。一分鐘內吸入十六苞，立卽死亡。效力顯著，採用亦極廣。以硫肝及肥皂溶液噴洒，能完全毀滅。遇活性炭卽迅速被其吸，故備有活性炭之防毒面罩，得防其侵襲。</p>
<p>（四）淚氣Chloracetophenon　爲無色之結晶體，不溶於水，性質牢固，於有機性溶液溶解之，有刺戟眼睛流淚作用，然經數分鐘新鮮空氣吸過，卽可恢復，美國警察好用。密貼之譴目眼罩，卽能禦防。</p>
<p>（五）芥氣Senfgas　此物有芥末臭味，故名。上次歐洲大戰時，用之甚廣。純粹品爲無色液體，難溶於水，在地面上能保持數日之久，在冬季竟可經月不發生變化，爲一種劇烈的細胞毒質，危險性强大。當其存在空氣內時，人絕不能察覺，不發生可注意的痛苦，但待覺察受害後，施救已嫌其遲。極微量之芥氣，已能使皮膚發生明顯之紅斑，漸成水泡，與火燙一樣。各按所吸收毒量之多寡，痊愈與吾及難易小一。亦能侵害肺部。一分鐘內吸入十二　時，卽能致死。呼吸器官用防毒面罩防禦。其餘體部，需用淸潔及新製之橡皮套穿着。漂白粉有毀滅本品之作用，在可疑的芥氣中毒時，可用漂白粉溶液冲洗，在滿布芥氣的地面上，可散布漂白粉，或以其溶液噴射。</p>
<p>（六）葵氣Chlorvinylarsine氣味似天竺葵的臭氣，一名Lewisit，或稱死露，係稍呈黃色之液體，難溶於水，易溶於有機溶液中。對於表皮，和芥氣一樣能惹起發泡。此物在歐戰後所發，毒力究竟如何，不得而知；但由其刺戟性的臭氣，吾人已可知其存在，又易爲鹼性溶液毀滅，不能通過濾氣套，遇漂白粉，著性卽消失，故實際應用的效能，有待於證明。</p>
<p>（七）二爚基氣化砷Diphenylarsinchlorid一名克拉克一Claak　I，係高沸點的固體，在毒氣彈爆炸時，化爲極細之霧狀物而飛揚。具强烈的刺戟鼻，喉，眼的作用，一立方粎空氣中，含有一兞時，已使人不能耐受。此霧狀物能透過普通的呼吸濾氣套，使敵人不得不卸去防毒面套，乘此機會，施用肺臟毒氣，促其斃命。濾氣套上加濾霧器，卽能防禦。此物遇水卽分解而毀滅。</p>
<p>（八）二爚基精化砷Diphenylarsubctanid爚某氯化砷，易受水分解失其效力，故又有此物之發明，一名克拉克二Clark　II，也是固體，極難溶解於水，性質耐久，毒氣彈爆炸後，化爲微細之霧狀，爲强烈的眼鼻喉粘膜之刺戟物.一立方粎空氣內，含有〇·〇〇五兞時，卽令人流淚，至至〇·二五兞時，人卽不能耐受。本品不能透過濾霧套。</p>
<p>就以上所述，總括言之，軍用毒氣中，具有激烈危險性者，計光氣，芥氣及二爚基蜻化砷之三種。在歐洲大戰時，所用之毒氣，種額已非常之多：大戰吿終，到現在已十七年，新發明的又不知多少，國防化學，各國都是嚴守秘密，我人無從知共底細。不過每種毒氣，總可有想出一種防護的方法應付，現代人不能造出一種絕對不能防禦的毒質。並且不論何種毒氣，要想利用他把整個城市或鄕鎭的居民一齊殺死，事實上不是容易的，因爲廣闊的空間，風，雨，都是自然的防禦物。不過在局部的戰爭，要塞的奪取，毒氣確是一種威脅武器。</p>
<h3>上海市其美路平民村子女死亡統計</h3>
<p>— 李彩華</p>
<p>此乃本村二七六個婦人調査所得，這裏爲了要先明白子女死亡數目起見，得先一述生育子女的實數和現有子女的數目·二七六個婦之中有二三個婦人從未生育過，有結婚一年至卅年，究何原因，她們的答案都是不知道三個字·二五三個生育婦人共生育子女九九四人，分配起來，生育一個子女的有三六人，占百分之一四·二三·二個的五三人，占百分之二〇·九五。三個的四四人，占百分之一七·三九。四個的二七人，占百分之一〇·六七·五個的三五人，占百分之一三·八三。六個的一七人，占百分之六·七二。七個的一七人，占百分之六·七二。八個的一二人，占白分之四·七四·九個的五人，占百分之一·九八。十個的四人，占百分之一·五八。十一個一人，占百分之〇·七九。十二個的二人，占百分之〇·七九。生育二個子女的婦人是最多數，最少的是生育十一個子女的婦人。平均每人生育子女爲三·五三口。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>二五三個婦入現在有子女六一七人，其中有一一個婦人沒有子女。有一個子女的婦人最多，占百分之二八·〇九。二個次之，占百分之二七·六九。有八個子女的最少，占百分之〇·八三。二四二婦人平均每人現有子女二·五四口。六一七子女占生育實數中百分之六二·一。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>九九四個子女共死亡三七七人，在生育實數中占白分之三七·九。性別方面很出乎我們意外，尋常我們以爲重男輕女的觀念牢牢在我們大衆的腦際，一定是女多於男，其實我們只要看子女死亡年齡和病原統計就曉得了。據作者調査子女死亡性別是這樣：男二〇〇人占百分之五三·〇五。在生育實數中占百分之二〇·一二。女一七七人占白分之四六·九五。在牛育實數中占百分之一七·七八。男女百分比之差爲六·一。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>至於子女死亡時的年齡，爲醒目計，列表於下：</p>
<p>二五三婦人子女普通死亡時年齡之分配</p>
<p>右表一至三歲的一組死最亡多，半月以下一組死亡的次之，十三至十六歲一組的死亡數目最少。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>現在來說子女死亡病原：</p>
<p>破傷風者六二人，占白分之一六·四五。在生育實數中占百分之六·二四</p>
<p>麻疹者六七人，占百分之一七·七七。在生育實數中占百分之六·七四·</p>
<p>腦膜炎者七九人，占百分之二〇九五。在生育實數中占百分之七·九五。</p>
<p>白喉者一三人，占百分之三·四五。在生育實數中占百分之一·三一。</p>
<p>天花者三〇人，占百分之七·九六。在生育實數中占百分之三·〇一·</p>
<p>痢疾者二一人，占百分之五·五七。在生育實數中占百分之二·一一。</p>
<p>肺炎者一〇人，占百分之二·六五</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>。在生育實數中占百分之一·〇一。</p>
<p>肺結核病者一二人，占百分之三·一八。在生育實數中占百分之一·二一</p>
<p>傷寒者三三人，占百分之八·七三。在生育實數中占百分之三·三二。</p>
<p>猩紅熱者三人，占百分之〇·七九。在生育實數中占百分之〇·三〇。</p>
<p>百日咳者三人，占百分之〇·七九。在生育實數中占百分之〇·三〇。</p>
<p>霍亂者五人，占百分之一，三三。在生育實數中占百分之〇·五〇。</p>
<p>盲腸炎者一人，占百分之〇·二七。在生育實數中占百分之〇·一一。</p>
<p>腦充血者八人，占百分之二·一二。在生育實數中占百分之〇·八〇。</p>
<p>膿毒者八人，占百分之二·一二。在生育實數中占百分之〇·〇。</p>
<p>臌脹者四人，占百分之一·一〇。在生育實數中占百分之〇·四〇。</p>
<p>營養不良者九人，占百分之二·三八。在生育實數中占百分之〇·九一。</p>
<p>意外死亡者九人，占百分之二·三八。在生育實數中占百分之〇·九一。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>上面的死亡數目，非常驚人，在年齡上病原上允其驚人。死於腦膜炎者最多，次之是麻疹，再决之是破傷風，最少是盲腸炎。在年齡上前面已經列表說明，一歲至三歲最多，次之是半月以下，最少數是十三歲至十六歲。我們曉得在半月以下死亡的都是破傷風，破傷風就是產婆接生的禍根。產婆要受訓練，這是刻不容緩的了。至於產婆，作者曾調査本村二五三個生育的婦人，這裏不妨附帶地提出來吿訴讀者：二五三婦人產婆接生者二〇八人，占百分之八二·二一。西醫接生者三九人，占百分之一五·四二。自己接生者六人，占百分之二·三七。</p>
<p>至於麻疹本來是極易治療的兒病，並不有什麼危險，祇耍婦人有普通的衛生常識就可應付了。而死於麻疹者占着次多數，使人看了要發抖的，中國衛生敎育的幼稚在這裏是很分明的了。</p>
<p>其次死於營獲不良的九人，其中祇有一人，因母親病而無乳哺養；其餘都是他的母親為了生計，整天整夜的工作，無暇撫育，把她們的子女活活的餓死。勞工託兒所，勞工託兒所，請普遍的設立呀！這不僅是醫學上的問題，尙待整個社會的大改良哩！</p>
<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>車前科Plantaginaceae</p>
<p>車前Lantago　Major，L．var．asiatica，D．C.</p>
<p>(植物）自生於山野，多年生草也。葉叢生於短莖間，有長柄，作長卵圖形，邊綠完整，有顧著之葉脈數條、自葉腋間抽出長梗，頂生穗狀花序，夏日開淡紫色小漏斗狀之花。蒴果作小紡錘形。</p>
<p>（生藥）車前草Herba　Plantaginis，係挅集帶花整株之車前而乾燥之者也。</p>
<p>車前子Semen　Plantaginis，係採集其成熟之種子而成。本品直徑，不超出二公厘，为暗褐钯之粒子，味微苦。有粘液姓。</p>
<p>（成分）全草中含有Aucubin　C15H24O10（配糖体）。种子有多量之粘液，其他含有PlantenolsaureC5H8O3（？）琥珀酸，Sfrnin，Cholin等。据日本高桥氏報吿，謂由全草中分離得Plantagin之配糖體。</p>
<p>（藥理）根據高橋氏Plantagin之實騐，謂本物賓對於呼及中區，有相當作用，可使呼吸运动深大而且缓慢，并有顯著之鎭咳作用。又能使分泌神經亢奮，增加氣管與氣管枝之粘液，及消化液之分泌、至血液之容解，則無此種作用。</p>
<p>（藥用）舊說：車前草及車前子為利尿藥。又車前子有鎭咳，止瀉效。用量為三—五公分，作煎劑用。</p>

<h3>夏令衛生運動的重要性和夏令衛生的注意點</h3>
<p>— 胡嵩山</p>
<p>——五年五月廿日在鹽城縣夏令衛生運動週講演詞——</p>
<p>一年四季，氣候不同，所發生的疾病，也因而有異。夏令炎帝肆威，火繖高漲，溫度之高，居一歲之首，這個時候呀！最厲害的最危險的致人命的急性傳染病——「霍亂」，「傷寒」，「痢疾」等的病原菌和「瘧疾」的病原蟲—胞子—，應運而生，滋榮繁殖。同時這些傳染病的媒介物「蒼蠅」，「蚊蟲」，也孳牛繁殖，做牠們的奴隸和走狗，媒介傳染，帮兇作惡，助紂爲虐，擺開陣容，拉開戰綫，以向我們的生命進攻，這個時候，可以說是我們最容易害傳染病的天氣到了，可以說是我們易於死亡的時令到了。如果我們飲食起居以及一切日常生活，偶一不愼，不注意衛生，那末，就有感染病的機會，就有生命的危險。我們自己一人或者旁的一個人，不注意衛生，感染了急性傳染病，——「霍亂」或是「傷寒」或是「痢疾」或是「瘧疾」，並不是就了事了。還要傳染別人哩！所以往往一傳染之起，流行四境，蔓延猖獗，爲害社會，死亡枕藉，無可遏止，所謂「星火燎原，瀰漫靡已。」此外還有「中暑」，也是夏令的疾病，也很危險，有殞命之虞。所謂「中暑」，包括兩種病一呌「熟時病」，一呌「日射病」。什麽呌做「熱時病」，在溫度特高，空氣飽和的天氣中，苦悶異常，呼吸困難，因而頓時精神昏憒，不省人事的，這呌做「熱時病」，什麽呌做「日射病」？在溫度特高，濕度特小，日光强烈的天氣中，受日光直射而精神昏迷，不省人事的，這呌做「日射病」。這就是俗說熱痧症，也很危險。</p>
<p>據衛生署的統計，我國入口死亡，比較各國，每年寃死有六百萬之多，而這六百萬中，因時疫而死的居泰半。我國的人口死亡率，伺以這樣高的呢？硏究起來，不消說，當然是因爲我國民衆知識缺乏而不知注意衛生，有以致之；尤以不注意夏令衛生的原因爲最大。夏令衛生旣然是很是重要，而一般民衆却反這樣地不注重，怎麼辦呢？就是要用這種轟轟烈烈的運動週，轟動宣傳，喚起全國民衆對於夏令衛生特別注意，以保個人的生命，羣衆的生命，民族的健康。不然的說，不從事運動，引起注意，而一般民衆仍漫不加以注意，那末，到這夏天裏，個人的生命，羣衆的生命和民族的健康，就沒有保障了。尤其是今年的夏天，格外要注意。爲什麽呢？我們根據歷史和經騐，知道十年一次大水災，五年一决小水災，今年是個小水災的年頭，我們又知道疫疾常伴水災以供來，據一般人推測，今天又是個流行霍亂的年頭，所以要格外注意。</p>
<p>病了，死了，經濟的損失，人口的損失，國家的損失，民族的損失，其大無比，這是多麽可怕而痛心的事啊！由這樣看來，夏令衛生運動是何等地重要？我們能够忽視嗎？我們能够隨隨便便馬馬虎虎不去努力嗎？</p>
<p>至於夏令衛生的注意點，現在報告如下：</p>
<p>注意飲料水　不淸潔的水料，不可用。未煮沸的水不可喝。</p>
<p>注意食物　一、陳舊的腐敗的蒼蠅停過的過宿的食物不可吃。</p>
<p>二、生水浸過的或切開有時間的瓜果不可吃。</p>
<p>三、露攤上和商店裏的不淸潔的瓜菓氷洪淋及其他一切食品不可吃。</p>
<p>四、食物上須罩以紗罩，以免蒼蠅接觸附留病菌於共上。</p>
<p>五、食不可太飽，以免消化障礙，食物停留胃腸中時間過久，腐敗分解，而是召發疾病的誘因。</p>
<p>禁忌生食　生食也爲夏令召發疾病的一種誘因，往往有人早上吃生食，晚間就發病，亟宜禁忌。</p>
<p>撲滅蚊蟲　蚊蟲爲傳染瘧疾的媒介，很是厲害，巴拿馬運河第一次開鑿，爲其爲害工人而失敗，是個鐵證。牠的幼蟲呌孑孓，生於汚水中。撲滅方法，陰溝中的缺中的汚水，須排洩乾凈，不容瀦留，使孑孓無生存的餘地。污水並須用福爾馬林或來沙爾藥液消毒，蚊蟲除須亟。</p>
<p>撲滅蒼蠅　蒼蠅爲傳染霍亂，傷寒，痢疾的媒介，牠的幼蟲呌蛆，生於糞坑中。其撲滅方法，用石灰乳或石炭酸水，傾注於糞坑中，自可消滅無餘，至蒼蠅則用捕蠅紙，撲蠅撲或捕蠅罩等撲滅之。</p>
<p>勿被蚊蟲可咬　門窗須裝置紗門紗窗，床上須張掛蚊帳；並須緊押共四周，免被蚊蟲可咬，招致瘧疾。</p>
<p>注意淸潔與消毒　一切日常生活用具和衣服等等，均須十二分淸潔和消毒，以免病菌寄生而傳染。淸潔就是常常洗滌。消毒可用煮沸消毒，爲最方便，最經濟，最完善。</p>
<p>勿受暑熱　勿受暑熱，以免發生熱射病和其他急性傳染病的誘因。</p>
<p>勿在烈日下行動　烈日下行路，或工作，均須避免，免生日射病。</p>
<p>禁忌露宿　夏夜露宿，易於受凉，而爲種種疾病的誘因，皆宜禁忌。</p>
<p>總之，凡是不合衛生的，我們均應特別注意改進才是。上面幾條看起來很是平凡，但是却很重要，我們照這樣行來，疾病自然可免。</p>
<h3>牙齒常識問答（三三）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一六〇問）　牙患的治療以自療嗎？</p>
<p>答　牙患的治療修補，多屬於牙醫生的範圍。本章所述的，不過對於病家所欲知及應知的地方，咯爲指示。其目的在使病家　遇到牙患，感覺早治的必要，免致延誤：　在治療期問，稍知治療手續的大槪，不致常常懐着疑問或不信任心，妨礙治療的進行；　能够和牙醫生合作在家能實行他所囑咐的各項，以宏治療的功效：　如一時不能得到牙醫生的診治時，凡自己可以爲力的地方，能够知道一些，以應一時之急。</p>
<p>第二節　關於蛀牙和牙髓疾病的治療</p>
<p>（第一六一問）　初起的小蛀洞怎樣治理？</p>
<p>答　應該請牙醫生，先把蛀洞裏腐齲的部分用車牙機車去，然後用藥消毒，再用耐久的材料補好。蛀洞愈小，修補愈易，效果亦愈佳。</p>
<p>（第一六二問）　已經覺痛的蛀洞，應該怎樣治理？</p>
<p>答　先車去腐蛀的部分，疼痛已經醫好後，方可塡補。</p>
<p>（第一六三問）封止痛藥後，如果疼痛仍舊劇烈，應該怎樣治理？</p>
<p>答　這時候蛀洞已深，牙髓已經發炎作痛，無法保存，應該先把牙髓抽去，再行塡補，普通呌做抽神經。</p>
<p>（第一六四問）　抽牙髓的手續怎樣？</p>
<p>答　牙髓遝是活的時候，一觸卽痛不可忍，所以必須用藥把牠殺死或麻醉後，方可抽除。用藥麻醉，當時可抽，封藥殺死，則須一二日後方可。抽時車開髓室，用很細有剌的長針，把各個牙根管內的牙髓抽凈。</p>
<p>（第一六五問）　殺牙髓的藥封好後，病家爲什麽要謹守牙醫生的囑約</p>
<p>答　殺牙髓的藥，藥性很强，病家必須遵守牙醫生約定的時侯，回去復診，不可逾時，以免引起牙根膜炎。如果半途覺得所封的藥脫出或滲出，應該卽去吿知牙醫生。</p>
<p>（第一六六問）　牙髓抽去後，塡補的手續怎樣？</p>
<p>答　牙髓抽去後，爲穩妥起見，要歇一週或旬日，如經過良好，方行塡補。塡補時，先把牙根管塡補，再歇二三日如不感異狀，卽可將其餘部分補好。所以治理抽牙髓的牙齒，前後所需的時間和手術，要比治理單純的蛀牙多三四倍。因此牙醫生所收的手術費，大槪也要多三倍左右。</p>
<p>（第一六七問）　牙根管塡補後，有發生什麽症象的可能？</p>
<p>答　因牙根管充塡補物刺激牙根膜之故，有時候能够發生輕度的牙根膜炎，牙齒稍覺浮起不適，然經過數日，卽能平復。如痛苦繼續不减時，則應將塡補物拆去，候治愈再補。</p>
<p>（第一六八問）　牙髓已死的蛀牙怎樣治理？</p>
<p>答　如牙髓已經腐敗，就會發生一種特異惡臭，應先開大根管，洗除腐物，封以消毒藥，逐日或隔日一換，直至蛀洞毫無臭味，方可塡補。所以手續很爲麻煩。若是牙根膜被波及時，則應參照下節牙根膜炎的療法去治理。</p>
<p>（第一六九問）　乳牙的蛀洞怎樣治理？</p>
<p>答　乳牙沒有到換牙時候，發生蛀洞，亦應卽請醫生補好，不可延誤，以免蛀壊，早期失落。</p>
<p>（第一七〇問）蛀殘不能塡補的牙齒，或蛀剩的牙脚，爲什麼要早拔去？</p>
<p>答　這種殘齒，已經失却咀嚼的功用，若任其留存，反有引起急性傳染性牙根膜炎的危險。牠一方面是口中微菌污垢停駐的大本營，一方面因爲殘留牙髓在內腐敗化膿，是膿毒傳入人體的入口地。故所以應該把這禍根子，早日拔去爲是。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚草</p>
<p>（八十四）旋毛蟲病（Trichinosis）</p>
<p>旋毛蟲病是怎樣一種病？</p>
<p>這是一種蟲類寄生於動物的腸和肌肉內的病。</p>
<p>旋毛蟲是誰發見的？</p>
<p>是Zenker氏所發見的，西文名是Trichinea　Spiralis</p>
<p>這種蟲體，原來寄生在那幾種動物的體內？</p>
<p>大多數寄生在猪的身體內，有時也有寄生在白鼠，灰鼠，兎，和狗體內的。其中可區分腸旋毛蟲和肌旋毛蟲。</p>
<p>寄生在人體的旋毛蟲，是怎樣侵入的？</p>
<p>因爲旋毛蟲的幼蟲，往往存在於猪的肌肉內，人們若吃了未熟透的猪肉，便被侵入胃內；於是幼蟲的被膜脫落，就成爲腸旋毛蟲。這種腸旋毛蟲的母蟲，寄生在腸壁內而幼蟲經淋巴管和血管而進肌肉內，成爲螺旋狀，包以石灰質的被膜。肉眼的觀察起來，肉中有許多灰白色小點，就是這種幼蟲。</p>
<p>患旋毛蟲的時候，病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>傳染後須經過三四天的潛伏期纔發病。發病的病狀，可分爲二期。</p>
<p>第一期的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>第一期的病狀，胃部有壓感，惡心，嘔吐，腹痛，泄瀉，間或呈便秘。同時訴肌痛，肌强直。伴以惡寒戰慄發熱，面部尤其是眼臉，起浮腫。這樣的症狀經一星期，纔入第二期。</p>
<p>第二期的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>到了第二期的時候，血中的旋毛蟲幼蟲，進入肌肉內，於是病肌腫脹疼痛，　反射減少或消失。若侵犯嚼肌，咽肌和喉眼等肌的時候，則有咀嚼或燕下障礙，嗄聲眼痛；尤其必要的若是侵犯呼吸肌隔膜肌間肌的時候，則起胸痛，呼吸不足，呼吸因難等症狀，甚至因痰液的瀦積而發支氣管肺炎的。在這第二期的時候。軀幹和四肢往往起浮腫，惡寒戰慓發熱都持續不退，或有陷於頭痛，不眠，昏慒，和脾腫及腦膜炎症狀的</p>
<p>旋毛蟲病人的皮膚和血液尿液等，有什麼異狀？</p>
<p>皮膚發匐行疹，蕁麻疹，小出血，膿疱疹或汗疹。血液中白血球增加，尿液中有蛋白質發現。</p>
<p>這種病的預後，吉凶如何？</p>
<p>輕症，兩三星期治愈：重症而慢性的，須經七八星期。一百人中有三四十人不治。</p>
<p>怎樣治療和預防？</p>
<p>在初期用强瀉藥，努力排除寄生蟲體。肌痛的時侯，用氯仿塗擦，局部用溫濕布，洗浴，或嗎啡注射等。預防的方法，在乎勿吃不熟透的猪肉。</p>
<p>更正　六月九日本刋第一篇「兩隻紅桃」一文，自第一格第三十六行起至第二格第四十二行卽本文完結止一段，應刋於第一格第一行起至同格第三十五行止之前，次序爲手民誤排顚倒，特爲更正。</p>

<h3>白嗶嘰東貨銷路獨好</h3>
<p>白嗶嘰日來勢軟化、公會上及茶會上市氣均疲、零　售價統轉便宜、西貨價昂、出路較鈍、國貨經售者無多利益、齊無心意推銷、東貨銷路雖廣、而到貨充斥、昨豐裕百歲坊白嗶嘰、一律沽售六元、章華九一八為三元二角半、三井、一律沽售六元、章華九一八為三元二角半、三並、岩井、阿部市·益記叫東貨雙黃邊統降售三元六角、雙紅邊三元五角半、次號三元二角半、無派司者可便宜三四角、而同業中均拒絕不售、</p>
<h3>糧食　空方有交貨之說　本月粉傾跌甚猛</h3>
<p>遠期亦被帶落三四分</p>
<p>多空雙方角逐甚劇烈</p>
<p>昨日紛市、上午開盤後、各月份一致見疾　之跌風、洋麥報價、雖較好一二角不等、惟以時局有和平之望、來日天時、又見晴熱、故業內外人心、遂一致松動、而本月份多頭、雖有軋空之意、惟大部分空頭、則以廠方居多、故在如是環境之中、有盡量交貨之傳說、因此市面傾跌是甚猛、初價係一角八分半、收價最低時、竟跌至一角、較之前週之高盤、仿佛差一角半之巨、土落之大、可見投機之不可忽視、遠期因廠方套售、浮多亦出、亦回跌二三分、迨至下午開盤、本月份因聞多頭仍有少數收買、且雙方勢成騎虎、各有硬幹之意、故開價續好、回振四分外、遠期初則甚平、後以近期之故、又復帶起一分外、此後情形、如實銷冷淡、到麥見暢、此種局面、恐難久持雲、</p>
<h3>天氣晴正　期麥跌風更厲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份一致回跌、因天時既佳、時局又有清明之望、且目下正值出新旺令、如無特殊原因、當無高漲之理、因此近遠期開價、一至松落三五六分不等、各盤賣買、亦異常暢旺、迨至下午開盤、交易略淡、市面則仍軟弱、本月份又以至貨漸豐、人心尤疲、上下午結果、本月份跌八分、余則跌四六七分、現麥市面、以到貨尚未大暢、高貨開價、仍然昂貴、如明光徐州臨淮關麥、開四元三角六分、按（陳麥之最低時衹四元二角）淮安麥四元一角五分、漢口麥四元一角六分、雙　麥四元零二分、崑山麥七折身份開三元五角、由福新去一千四百包、阜豐去一百包、聞此種新麥、大致係試辦性質雲、</p>
<h3>蠶豆旺到市價受挫</h3>
<p>各路新蠶豆現均已上市來源日湧、致辦戶有所揀選、市價乃立被撳小、如　行青蠶價約三元二三角、（市斛一百二十五斤）拘無交易、因該豆身份、仍頗潮軟、甬江白蠶跌雲角譜、做開三百八十余包、昨第一次上市嘉定大片白蠶到一百七十包、價開四元三角、由揚州幫辦雲、餘杭中　白蠶到三百七十包、價為四元五角、為東洋　之胃、以上之品質亦屬不佳雲、</p>
<h3>客秈市面依然堅挺</h3>
<p>昨　客秈到頭不旺、江西與長江浙東一帶、均祇零星小票、但雲化亦漸減少、市面仍屬兩平之局、昨日全市成交祇有四千多包、然客　　　甚活、寧波幫採辦江西中關機米、福州幫採辦機早一千多包、廈門雲湘　二百多包、泉州幫辦裝江北機米、本街則均有問津、本客雲化既活、後市仍屬挺俏之象、且粵省米價高昂、、迄未回平、昨粵幫亦復在市間訊、如能合劃通運、則日上或有若幹試裝也、</p>
<h3>薄稻厚粳雲路俱淡</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源共到二十余號、（貨共四千餘石）、本街銷路仍清、包胃動而不暢、祇大連籠海幫辦薄稻六七百包、及厚粳四百余包、故市況續疲、厚早粳行情低角許、薄稻亦小幾分、杜洋尖做出甚少、價無進出、陰變元市亦平庸、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船二十二三號、市上白粳去化依然平淡、價開高貨勉立、中次者略疲三五分、薄稻銷呆、價帶疲勢、陰變兀價形平定、</p>
<h3>海味　洋菜當令市盤最俏</h3>
<p>海帶帶絲均入疲途</p>
<p>（海帶）因客銷滯呆、存貨不能流動、且離出新時期不遠、故行號家存貨較多者、莫不亟圖脫卸、市價步步下落、昨日行家、兜售根室帶八元九角、濱中·國後·厚岸·川路等、尚可少二三角、鬼帶八元五角、首長八元三角、貓足七元七角、擇足八元、二番七元六角、三番六元二角、觀察現局、後市或有再跌之趨勢、</p>
<p>（帶絲）市亦疲軟、號貨久未開出、行售　嘜廂館貨九元八角、厚岸九元五角、大阪余元至兒元六角、</p>
<p>（洋菜）因時屆署夏、正當銷令、所以各路客幫、均有採辦、惟產地來源不旺、隨到隨通、致少存落、行號售盤一致扳緊、昨日號貨開出水清牌十件、價三百二十五元、金鶴牌五件、價三百十六元、比較前盤、暴漲二十余元、且行進意甚濃、市極俏俐、</p>
<h3>糖市　粵粗白標價不動</h3>
<p>成交見減</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平定、公會劃盤如二四粗砂折現貨叫二十二元一角、轉口貨六元八角半、原價未動、亦乏成交、東白八號現貨升一角、YT嘜以二十一元半成交、九號二十一元半、四號二十二元二角、轉口四號七元二角半、八號六元八角、九號六元四角、交易寥寥、本廠綿白市氣較軟、如振記金心大華一號均叫原價、去化亦少、號貨有潮邦開出高綿赤十二元八角、次之十二元三角、成交二百余包、高半南青九元七角、成交六七十包、興化幫大貢粉折叫十八元、比前又漲、惟此貨係由南關進口元派司可證、故轉口為難、行方觀望未進、合組公司昨屆標兌之期、計粵粗折等總定額為六千二百五十八包、標價如前、結果成交廣州區五羊粗白六百二十八包、二十一元七角、市中砂白十包、二十元七角、二號綿白十包、二十元八角、四號綿白十包、二十元半、並聞荷粗砂昨由芝巴德輪入口、到有二千余包、又國產五福白冰由太原輪入口、到有二百五十九箱、</p>
<h3>五金　二號折鉛皮廠家暢辦</h3>
<p>二號白鉛皮、近因香煙廠、玩具廠、及兵工廠等紛紛採辦、是以市貨不夠銷　、目到源不多、市上流通貨頓　缺、故行情比前見挺、刻市如現欵買賣、每桶價一百四十元、查　昨市上開出共三四十桶、底貨益寡、行情一時恐難回小雲、</p>
<h3>會司鐵有大批定貨做出</h3>
<p>二百磅會司鐵、近因某某等制罐廠大批訂辦、所以市貨被購逮三四千箱之多、行情因之見俏、每箱價要三十二元五角、比前好一元許、惟海外定貨交易昨亦做出四五百噸、其價每箱七金元四角、比前亦好起二角之譜、</p>
<h3>絲茶海外絲市日益俏俐</h3>
<p>廠經因持價過高反無成交</p>
<p>昨日紐約星期無市、橫濱絲價、現貨售開七三零元、較上週六漲二五元、期貨七二八元、漲一九元、海內外絲市、人心增多堅好、尤以申埠為甚、因此國外來帳、以申埠持價過高、轉無成交、如白廠跳舞等級一三·一五持價七二零元、二〇·二二持價六八零元者、外商對此討價、尚多考慮、故昨日白廠絲市又呈清堅局勢、此外白廠B字不論均度者二〇·二二條份及灰經七裏等、略有若幹售開、價格無甚變更雲、</p>
<h3>人絲滯銷價無變化</h3>
<p>人造絲因內地客幫無交易、故市面終覺平平、各價無變化、成交計有本杭埠綢廠購進一百五十號司尼挨二號有光四十箱、價一百零六元、不連稅、一百五十號金佛手牌半光二十五箱、價一百二十五元、不連稅、本埠南市絲帶廠購進一百二十號金魚圓房　牌二十余箱、價三百九十元、一百二十號天橋牌、價　四百十五元、一百五十號天橋牌四百十元、成交寥寥、但存底亦已甚薄、昨日魯意師摩拍賣、貨計十四箱、結果價一百二十號天橋牌四百十六元數角、一百五十號天橋牌四百二十三元、又一百五十號美女牌無光四百三十元、查該價均高過於市、</p>

<h3>國內收報人付費電報辦法述略</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>收報人付費電報辦法，對於國際電報及國內新聞電報，實行有年，一般稱便。惟國內民衆利用之尋常電報，未經開放，故業務未能發達。交通部爲便利國內民衆通信起見，爰於本年五月二十七日公布「國內收報人付費電報辦法十五條，卽於六月一日起實行，茲將其手續要點，槪述如下：</p>
<p>關於發報人請求時之手續</p>
<p>發報人請求時，應向當地電局索取空白聲請書，塡列　聲請入姓名職業及詳細住址：（如有電報掛號者並將掛號字樣註明）　發報地名：　收報人姓名及詳細住址：（如有電報掛號者，並將掛號字樣註明）　擬發電報之種類等項。送交電局轉呈交通部電政司核辦。電政司接到聲請書後，卽飭知收報電局向收報人接洽同意，塡具「照付國內收報人付費電報：費願書」，簽名蓋章，並預付足敷半個月報費之預存金於收報電局，由該局呈發電政司，飭知發報電局通知發報人，開始發報。</p>
<p>關於收報人請求時之手續</p>
<p>由收報人請求者，應用書面向當地電局聲明，凡自國內某處某人發致本人之某種電報，由本人担任報費，經當地電局同意，卽填具「照付國內收報人付費電報報費願書」簽名蓋章，並付足預存金，由該局呈請電政司，轉飭發報局査照，並通知發報人補具聲請書，開始發報。</p>
<p>發報時之手續</p>
<p>電局供給發報人電報簽收簿，發電時，卽由電局收報人員就該簿簽名爲憑，不給收據。惟發報人應將圖章或簽名之式樣，送交電局存査，發報時，應於電報紙下端蓋章或簽名，以資對證</p>
<p>結算報費時之手續</p>
<p>收報電局按月依照來報底塡造賬單，向收報人結算報費，收報人接到帳單後，至遲須於五日內照付，如至第六月尙未照付者，收報局卽將各處發來之該項電報，向收報人逐一收取報費，方予投送。再逾五日仍未照付者，卽由收報局將預存金扣抵，如有不足，仍須追繳。同時用公電報吿電司轉知發報局撤銷發報人依照本辦法之發電權。</p>
<p>此項辦法之優點</p>
<p>査各大商行之營業，多賴各地支行爲之推銷，各地推銷之數量或其營業狀况，每日須發電報吿總行，以便計劃擴充或緊縮。此種商行發電，最宜採用「收報人付費電報辦法」，蓋各支行所發電報之報費，全由總行開支，則總行收通信統制之權，而支行僅負拍發電報之責，雙方均戚便利。再此項電報收報手續旣憑簽收簿簽名，不給收據，無須當時計算報費增加速率不少矣。</p>
<h3>談談國人發明的華文電報機</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>華文電報，我們都知道用號碼替代的方法，間接傳遞的。這種間接傳遞的方法，雖然有種種缺點。但是中國文字並不像外國文字樣地用字每拼凑成功的。它底廣複的字彙，用現行電報機器來傳遞，事實上是絕對不可能的。所以近來有些熱心國音運動的人，竭力主張用注音符號代替現在的四碼電報，但是也發生了下面幾種困難：　現在社會上尙未到普通應用注音符號的程度，發電公衆大都仍用原來文字拍發。　注音符號字母較多，不適合新式收發報機的傳遞。　注音符號有四聲和同音等困難，接到了一張完全用注音符號的電報，仍舊要費推測。所以利用注音符號來傳遞華文電報，依然不能解决直接傳遞文字的困難，記者在這篇文字裏，就是來介紹近年來國人發明的直接傳遞華文的電報機器，這種機器，雖然尙未在各電報局裏應用，但是理論上已經並無缺點，不久的將來，一定會得當局的核准，交各地電局採用的。</p>
<p>記者所知道的，現在發明成功的華文電報機，有岑士龍君及王柏年君設計的兩種，茲特分別把兩種電報機的原理，簡單介紹給讀者。</p>
<p>岑式華文電報機這種雷報機構成的原理是這樣的：牠把一萬個常用的漢字，照坐標紙（Coordinte　Paper）的排法，縱橫各十格，每格各十行，橫格代表千位，橫行代表百位，縱格代表十位，縱行代表單位，每一個字的地位，就把軍碼的數字，依照上述的千百十單位置安排着。譬如電字的電碼爲「七一九三，」那末畫字的地位，應該在橫格第八格（自右向左）內第二行向下第十格內第四字的地位。（註：因爲第一格及第一行都是零位，所以必須加一）照這樣排列着的漢字，用輕質的化學合金做成反寫的字模輪，用一個橫送及一個縱送的齒輪來控制字模輪的動作。至於齒輪的動作則被對方發來的電流所控制，華文電報直接傳送，就這樣地完成了。岑君士龍對於華文電報機的研究，眞是不遺餘力，他發明了這種方法傳遞華文電報之後，更進一步設計，使華文電報用自動發報機來傳遞，以免影饗電報原有的速率。這種機器，因爲構造較爲複雜，還沒有公開試騐過，以岑君的毅力和天才，我想政府當局一定有鼓勵的辦法，使他發明的機器，早日製造成功付諸實用。</p>
<p>王式華文電報機　王君發明的華文電報機一共有甲，乙，丙三種。甲種華文電報機係適用於我國現用之莫爾斯機和無綫電報用耳機收報者，機上裝一字盤，盤內有華文字一百行，每行一百字，共計一萬字，盤上裝一可以隨便移動之捏手捏手旁裝一指針，發報時將指針移對盤內任何一字向下一按，該字的相當電碼卽自動發至錢路。在收報局內裝一普通華文打字機，盤內之字均換以號碼，收報員收到號碼符號時，對準盤內號碼向下一撳，華文打字機卽可打出相當的文字。乙種華文電報機係適用我國現用韋氏及克氏自動機，該機的構造和使用方法完全與甲種的一樣，不過要附裝一具克利特鍵盤鑿孔機而已。發報時將字盤上指針移對盤內任何一字向下一按，該字之相當電碼，卽自動由鍵盤鑿孔機鑿在油紙條上，再將鑿成之油紙條用韋氏自動發報機發出，在收報局方面用克利特收報複鑿機接收，再將克利特收報複　機收下之油紙條，放入丙種華文電報機內，該機卽自動印出文字。</p>
<p>王君發明的華文電報機已經製造成功，聽說交部已特准王君到京作公開試騐，我希望在本刋下期有更好的消息，報告給讀者。</p>
<h3>要請發寄電報的先生們注意各點</h3>
<p>發寄電報的先生們，能於發寄電報時，注意下列各點，定能使電報速率，無形中提高不少了！</p>
<p>自譯電碼要加註原來文字　電碼自譯，難免忙中有錯咧！如果於電碼之旁加註原來文字，那末電局收到你的電報後，可有校對的機會，倘有錯譯，馬上代爲改正。</p>
<p>電文書寫要淸楚　電文書寫如果潦草，易使電局人員於工作繁忙時，認錯字眼，以致發生錯誤。例如洋文電報中的草式小寫A與〇〇與〇N與UE與LB與F等等，每易因書寫不淸的原故，而發生疑似的毛病。如經査詢明確，勢必稽延時間：如不加査詢，錯誤就出來了！至於華文電報文字，凡屬簡體字呀！草寫字呀！都不免發生錯誤，影響電報的效能。所以無論華洋文電報，最好請你把電文用正楷書寫淸楚，使人一目瞭然，包你絕無錯誤了！</p>
<p>收報人姓名住址要詳細寫明　以前發報人爲省費起見，每將收報人姓名住址，儘量縮短，因而發生「投遞不妥」「投送費時」或「誤投」的情事，非常之多。現在華文電報發報人姓名住址在十三字以內的，已規定作爲三字計費，你們大可不必再如以前的節减字數，致誤了投送。</p>
<p>發報人本人姓名住址要在電底寫明發報入姓名住址，如詳細寫明於電底下端，那末所發電報，萬一有「投送無着」或其他的情事，發生時，電局可按照所書姓名住址通知你，如果電底上沒有註明姓名住址，勢必無法通知，豈非貽誤你的要事嗎？</p>
<h3>電政組織上之史的觀察</h3>
<p>民國以來，我國電政組織，可分爲四期，第一期爲北京政府時代，第二期爲國民政府初期時代，第三期爲近年時代，第四期爲今後時代，茲分別述之：　北京政府時代，無錢電台及電話局，直轄部中，長途電話則由電話局兼辦。有綫電報，以事業特繁，分區管理，在交通部與各電報局之間，設立各區管理機關，此項管理機關，名稱時有變更，區域劃分亦間有增减，顧承轉之性質，則始終未變，此期中之電政組織，蓋以有綫電報爲其主幹也。</p>
<p>國民政府成立以後，有綫電及市內電話之組織，一仍其奮，惟以無綫電報及長途電話突飛猛進，於是有「無綫電報話管理處」之設置，總管全國無綫電台。有「長途電話話務管理處」之設置，分區管理全國之長途電話事務。嗣後「無綫電報話管理處」，改組爲「國際電信局，」而以辦理國際通信及國內無綫電通信爲其兩項主要職務。「長途電話話務管理處，」原以綫路區分，嗣改組爲「長途電話管理處，」而以省區爲劃分標準。至是我國之電政組織，遂以有綫電報，無綫電報，市內電話，長途電話爲四大系統。</p>
<p>最近兩三年來，交通部感於電政組織不免散漫，爲集中事權，節省開支起見，力謀改革，其見諸事實者，首爲局台之合併，將各處無綫電台與有綫電報局合併，設立當地無電報者，雖以事實關係，無從合併，亦受該區電政管理局之指揮。次爲報話局之合併，全國部辦電話局，除工程較大業務特繁之少數局所外，一律與當地電報局合併設立，統稱爲電報局。再次爲有綫電報與長途電話之合併，裁撤「長途電話管理處，」而以各省區長途電話之管理權，劃歸電政管理局。至長途電話營業機關，亦與電報方面合併設立。至是我國之電政組織，蓋以有綫電報，無綫電報，市內電話，長途電話合併而成一整個系統。</p>
<p>報話事業，旣經合併管理，若無完善之組織通則，不足以資遵守。交通部乃於五月十三日公布「電政管理局組織通則，」並通飭全國自六月一日起實行。該項管理局分置總務報務，話務，工務四課，會計一室。報務課得分有綫，無錢營業三股，分別掌管全區有綫電報報務，無綫電報報務，有無錢電報營業事項。話務課得分市內，長途，營業三股，分別掌管全區市內電話，話務長途電話話務，市內及長途電話營業事項。工務課得分機械綫路，材料三股，分別掌管全區電信機械，電信綫路，電信材料事項。惟未設市內或長途電話或已設而營業淸簡之區，不設話務課，其職掌歸併於報務課，課之事務淸簡者，得减少設股。今後之電政組織，其目的一方面得施統籌全局之計，一方面得收因地制宜之功，總期集中權力，節省經費，而增加辦事效率。</p>
<p>綜觀民國以來電政組織之嬗遞情形，實由簡單而趨於複雜，復由複雜而趨於簡單，其由簡單而複雜也，蓋爲謀新辦事業之迅速發展，其由複雜而簡單也，則着重於管理之合理，趨向雖有不同，而功效初無二致也。</p>
<h3>問答欄</h3>
<p>本刋特闢問答一欄，社會人士，對於電話收發手續及對於電信章程不明瞭之處，或對於電信常識有所垂詢時，本刋表示觀迎，具情奉答。</p>
<p>南昌張曾祥君問</p>
<p>國內國外供給收發船舶電報之海岸電台，究何處有？何處無？尤以國內爲最急於欲知者。</p>
<p>（答）全國海岸電台計有上海，靑島，福州，天津，烟台五處，漢口一處，不久卽可開放。</p>
<p>發船舶電報對於船在某一區內，其應由某一海岸電台傳遞，有固定之規定否？（如船行漢皖之間其轉遞應屬之何台）</p>
<p>（答）發寄船舶電報，先應預計該船現正航行之路程。如船行漢皖之間，應由上海電台接轉，將來漢口電台成立時，卽由漢口接轉。船行渤海之中，應由烟台電台接鞠。</p>
<p>華洋文格式按規則所舉之例，如（官艙十號王良驥新銘靑島」，又（Nelson　SS　Sinming　Tsingtaoradio）華文新銘之前，是否亦應加SS？靑島之後，是否亦應加（Radio）？新銘作二字抑作一字？靑島作二字，抑作一字？（Radio是否另作字。抑附地名之後不作字字？詳文（Tsingtaoradio）應作幾字？</p>
<p>（答）華文新銘之前，不必加SS，靑島之後，亦不必加（Radic）字樣。新銘靑島均作二字計費。洋文（Tsingtaoradio）作一字計費。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （茸餘）</p>
<p>昔有行道人，陌上見三叟，年各百餘歲，相與鋤禾莠·下車問三叟，何以致此壽？上叟前致辭：「夜臥不　首」。中叟前致辭：「內中嫗貌醜」。下叟前致辭：「量腹節所受」。旨哉三叟言！所以能長久。</p>
<p>這是晋朝一位應　老先生作的三叟行，雖是老古董，對於現今的衛生方法，倒也不謀而合，。諸位倘若照方試騐，靈騐眞勝過打「維他賜保命」針咧！因爲「呼吸淸新空氣」和「節慾」「愼食」，雖是人人知道是重要的，可是能實行的却很少。尤其是都會中人，通宵在歡，酒食徵逐，對於健康方面，一定要打折扣。讀了道首詩後，不知有所警惕嗎？</p>
<h3>紀念「陳老佛」</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>『陳老佛』這個人，是値得吾們紀念的：因爲他在前淸道光二十二年五月六七兩日裏，那英國許多的兵輪，膽敢駛入吳淞口。眼見飄揚的旗幟，遮蔽海上：他『陳老佛』，原來是江南提督，調任到吳淞防守，不過十天，當此敵人兵臨城下，自然不能俯首降伏，有違上官的命令：所以『陳老佛』馬上率領部下，日夜不離，沿岸紥起死營，以與敵人作一個殊死戰。</p>
<p>當時『陳老佛』，治軍狠爲嚴厲，在動員的當兒，他下一道軍令，『若有取民間一束柴草，……就要斬首』，因此他的軍隊，可稱是秋毫無犯的：不料紮營甫定。不到一日，英國的兵艦，早巳逼近，而且先行開火，攻我西砲台了：『陳老佛』指揮作戰，歷兩小時，竟把英艦打退，無奈那時，總督牛鑑駐在寳山城中，聽到勝利的消息，想來分功，不料他老人家乘了一頂肩輿，跟着幾百兵士，方到上海塘，已經被英兵窺見，就發了一個大砲，那一顆開花彈，恰巧落在牛鑑轎前，幾乎嚇得魄散魂飛，疾忙退去。敵方曉得後無救兵，盡力再攻我砲台『陳老佛』以孤軍死抗，不肯稍却：咦！忽然來了一個徐州總兵王志元向『陳老佛』說降，『陳老佛』大怒，志元就和牛鑑奔避而逃了。『陳老佛』獨屹然不動，在槍林彈雨裏向敵人殺出，到了最後，左脅受傷倒地，然而他仍然掙扎起來，右手尙揮旗不已，大呼不可退，激厲士卒，後來終因傷重，以致咯血，未幾，竟就陣亡，而吳淞爲東南要隘，也就此失守。</p>
<p>『陳老佛』的屍身，後來經兵士劉國標負了匿在寳山東門外蘆葦叢中，過了七日，還沒有收殮，吾們嘉定知縣陳廷璜前往，撫屍大哭，並經紀其喪事。是役，在鴉片戰爭初，淸廷得報，遂謚『陳老佛』爲忠愍公，建立專祠於寳山城內（卽今縣立初中）而『陳老佛』的遺像，還至今保存着，一到五月八日的那一天，就是他的紀念日。他的名呌『化成』，號『蓮峯』福建同安縣人：他少壯時，可以伏行水底，游泳百里以外，嘉寳兩邑呼爲『陳老佛』，因爲他與士卒同甘苦，能够保衛海疆，以捍護我地方的緣故。</p>
<h3>裸臂裸腿</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>自從婦女獲得解放之後，婦女的二臂，也跟着獲得解放了。旗袍袖兒，逐漸地由手腕而退縮到了臂灣，逐漸地更由臂灣，而退縮到了離肩一二寸。衣袖兒已是退到無可再退的地步了，於是乎自上而下，一眼便看上了袴脚管。把本來齊脚踝骨的袴脚管，縮短到了齊膝，更由齊膝之處，而縮短到了離膝七八寸。於是乎，娘兒們一入了夏季，上身的旗袍，近於馬甲化，下身的袴兒，雖然在開着高又的旗袍又口裏，還是瞧不到袴脚管。而兩條玉臂，兩條玉腿，遂都赤條條的盡露於外了。</p>
<p>小孩子們，每年總得種上一决牛痘，以免染得天花的危險，在初流行短袖旗袍時，一般的母親們，給伊們的小女兒們，播種牛痘時，一致的不種在臂上而種在腿上，說的是旗袍袖兒，一天短似一天，將來臂兒露在袖外，若是顯着一大塊一大塊的牛痘疤，未免不雅觀，當時我極度的欽佩着伊們設想的周到。後來，旗袍袖果然縮到了肩頭上了，於是我益佩伊們有先見之明。但是時勢是演進無已的，如今袴脚管兒，也廢掉了，不知昔日爲女兒設想周到的母親們，將如何是好。更不知今日爲女兒播種牛痘的母親們，將給伊們種在身上的那一部，方可以策萬全。</p>
<p>從前，爲了娘兒們，在暑天不穿襪，而引起了襪廠老闆們的籲請嚴禁裸足。但是現在盛行着裸臂裸腿了，我想衣料店老闆們，或許也將來籲請一下哩。不過在這裏，我却想以十二分的至誠，籲請愛好摩登的娘兒們，在可能範圍之內，還是少把尊臂尊腿之類，裸露着，因爲裸臂裸腿的動機，原不過是表示其健康美而已，像我國缺乏運動的娘兒們的腿臂，十九都是非瘦卽肥，毫無可觀的，有些，索性是佈滿着臭虫疤，凍瘃疤的，眞有些兒使人不敢領敎呢。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　雨細風斜還飛留跡處　夜蘭人靜獨寫絕交書</p>
<p>夢是神經感覺樞，因血管的運血集中，生出了錯覺同幻象，運本來算不了什麼神秘的事。可是作夢的人，總是疑惑這裏面有一種預兆存在、而且越是用心思的人，越容易作夢也就越抒夢當了一件預兆。江夢蘭這晚所作的夢正打入了他的心坎所不可得的事，在夢裏得着了。本來有許多人，不能滿足自己的慾望，全是靠作夢夾滿足。不過那一剎那滿足之後，往往是增加了自己一種悲憤。夢蘭也不亮電燈，就在漆黑的屋子裹，這樣站着。直等聽到遠遠的地方，有了兩聲鷄啼，這才微微的歎了一口氣。上床去安息了。到了次早起來，未免晚了一點，忽忽的洗子一把臉，趕快就夾了書包到學堂去。自己在路上走着的時候，也就暗想，今天不會再遇到章國器的了。過了每日在路上相遇的時間了。這樣的一轉念，並不像往日，老早的向前面去打量着，這時自低了頭，一步一步的走着。當走到那條窄巷子裏的時候，就有一陣脚步聲送到耳朶裏來，抬頭一看，倒不由自已猛可向後一退，正是揣念着的那個他走了來了。經過昨日在雨花台那一度會晤，彼此之問，覺得是很熟，彼此遇到，就這樣注目一下，似乎是太無禮了。因之他在那有意無意之間，臉上泛出了一層淺淺的笑容，這笑容可以說不是爲了章國器而發，因爲他並沒有向章國器正直的看了去。可是說他不是對了國器笑吧？然而這一條窄巷子裏，並無第二個人。所以國器雖不能立刻表示着感謝，對於這光風霽月一般的淺笑，却是深深的心領了。而且彼此一來一往，脚步又不便停住，在那種四目對照的當兒，時間是非常的短促。國器就是要想向他回禮，也是來不及了。好在　小時之後，又是彼此下課回來的時候，國器所領受的淺笑，就有法子答謝了。他爲了是要回答這一個淺笑，由學校裏出來，很快的，就投奔這一條巷子。到了這巷子口上，並沒有看到江夢蘭，可不敢走得太快了。因走得快了，穿過了遺兩三條巷子，各自分　，那又不能會面了。步子是那樣走得慢，每隻脚向前移動一步，都要停頓一分鐘。（三五）</p>
<h3>讀中國名畫觀摩記後</h3>
<p>— 馬公愚</p>
<p>吾友施君　　，工書擅　，潛心　述，所見名畫甚　，最近根據我國參加倫敦中國藝展中繪畫，撰成中國名畫觀摩記，都九萬餘言；用生動簡練之筆，將唐宋元明淸歷代百餘家名作，一百六十八幀，尺幅片質，童法用筆，一一描為，宗派源流，里居爵祿，一一考據，眞賀優劣。題識詩跋，亦一一加以批評論列；如記趙伯駒春山圖曰：…靑綠鈎勒，筆姿工細，圖中峯巒重疊，樹木翁翳，桃柳成行，桑田耕牧，週塘扁舟，有如世外桃源，一片江南春色也；惟筆力稚弱，不類伯駒，乾降跋稱，此幀風神筆力，與趙伯駒眞蹟相合，即審爲趙伯駒云云，殊不可解！且細察圖中牛馬橋梁，惡劣不堪，豈出伯駒之手乎？……又論趙子昂重江疊嶂圖卷曰：「……山水墨色，重江疊嶂，頗僥山重水複之意，惟筆力柔弱無變化，墨色殊欠濃淡，永灘多作尖頭，旣繁且亂，似用熟紙描摹，趣味平平，歷代名人，題咏殆遍，雖非子昂傑出之作，要亦名蹟耳！……」其評鷺有如此者，每章結論，亦能提綱挈領，要言不繁；並選歷代精逸神妙之品三十餘幀，附印原圖影片，頗足參證欣賞，實為歷來畫記所罕見，頃已由商務印書館印行出版，余得先覩之快，爰述梗槪，以吿同好。</p>
<h3>玲瓏石上</h3>
<p>— 朱承熙</p>
<p>我們旣上了虞山，出維摩寺西行的時候，脚力乏了，一連幾天的辛苦，逼着我需要歇息一會再走，於是我們爬上一塊玲瓏的石上，望望遠處的風景。</p>
<p>揚子江綿延着趟在東南面，滾滾的江水，在陽光下閃着紫，綠，赭，等等的顏色，雲的陰　影，一塊塊的在水面上浮動，點點帆影，像一片片潔白的鵝毛，俯視山麓，開滿了紅的，紫的，黃的杜鵑花，五色繽紛，江邊，湖田一方方的浮在水面上，菜花黃黃的，麥綠綠的，互相襯托着，眞是鮮明，風吹來，松樹林裏發出一陣松濤，和泉水潺潺的流動聲，鷓鴣的歌唱聲，混合而成一片幽美的交響曲。</p>
<p>遠望長江彼岸，狼山糢糊的影子，在烟似的空氣中，現出一個渺茫的輪廓來，所謂「陽春烟景，」眞是不錯的。</p>
<p>坐了一會，我們再鼓起精神，爬上另一個高峯。</p>
<h3>拗筍</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>前幾時，在故鄕—甬西桃源—一般婦女姑娘們，又在忙着拗筍了。拗筍拗的是「野山筍」，任何人都可以去拗，不用化錢的。筍，在我們故鄕，種類是很多的。譬如那毛筍，烏筍，龍鬚，白殼箕…等等，這些都是私人的產業。每一個竹園，有的圍着籬笆，有的圍着矮石墻，凡在笆內墻內的筍，不許外人採掘，否則要受村人嚴厲的處罰。惟有在深山冷　中長的野筍，雖山各有主，而節却不成為私有物。那苟的種類：較細小的，有「花節團滿殼筍，紅殼筍，野龍鬚。較粗大的，有黃泥筍，野毛筍」等。普通市上賣的多是私有的出產，用鋤去掘起來的，名爲掘筍：那野山筍的幹，比較細小，只用手去拗斷就行，故名爲拗筍。</p>
<p>現在，農事已開始活動，農人大多數下田工作，爲此拗筍這件事，由婦女姑娘們來幹的多。伊們大家的定幾個同志，早晨由家中出發。健步入山，帶些索兒和包布。在發現有竹葉那裏，便爭先奮身鑽入，把長長短短的筍拗斷，一捆捆用索兒縛着。這樣的越山過嶺，盡力搜求。約莫過了中午，肚子餓了，體力乏了，手頭筍也有了！多的三數十斤，少的一二十斤，大家包的包，紮的紮，從從容容下得山來，回到家裏去。</p>
<p>拗了一次筍，可吃上三五天。一時吃不完，　筍乾，作醃筍，以供不時之需。過了十幾天，度量第二次筍又長大了，便約諸同志姊妹們，再去幹一次。一個筍時中，前後可幹上三次。但出發日期，也須計算精確，過早沒有筍長出來，過遲已被別人拗過，却要正當其時，纔會不虛此行。</p>
<p>筍，吃的味道尙在其次，拗的趣味格外濃厚，小時也曾伴姊妹們去領略過，偶憶及此，不覺感慨系之了。</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （孫籌成）</p>
<p>近來各地政府，對於敬老二字甚注意，報上時見某省某市開書老會，到有七十歲以上男子，與八十歲以上女子若干人盛况，籌成昨經本市西門，見救火會附近大德里口，圍有多人，住視之，一見面有菜色鬚髮皆白，身穿破舊棉襖，手持樹枝木杖之老者，跪於人行道上，面前鋪一白紙，書「最可憐八十七歲老苦命孤獨無靠」十四大字，下有「難人敬懇者，淸江丁家集人氏，開香粉店營業，民國十五年水荒，空無得至體言，後因親戚借欵不祥，與隨後被匪搶燒一空爲來滬投親，不料他人另眼看待來銀錢遇旱，睡到半年，皆用空，老妻年已七十八歲，臥病在床，命在旦夕，難人年已八十七歲，沒兒沒女，無得依靠，眞苦命者，欲想回家，川資無着，欲行不能行，想死不得死，故不已而祗不得下賤之人叩求焉，過路來往仁人君子，諸大善士，八方先生，大發惻隱之心」等語，文理欠通，語甚悲惻，行人間有擲以銅元一二枚者。少頃巡邏巡士來，吿以此地有礙交通，不能常跪，乃令其退後五步，跪於弄內，同為老者，而苦樂不均如是，殊堪浩嘆！</p>

<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>康健</p>
<h3>腸加答兒</h3>
<p>腸加答兒，為夏令易見之病。蓋因誤食腐敗，刺激腸粘膜而起。症：每日下痢二三回，甚至三四十回。腸嗚，腹痛，體溫增高，全身倦怠。服藥宜興以少許之洩下劑，切勿止之。蓋止痢反使腸內細菌猛增，加重病勢。同時宜服以消導劑，以助腸部機能。考「強胃精」一藥，因其所具成分，對於腸胃部分，最為恰當，故可作為腸內消毒劑。因之，洩下腹痛等，卽可瘳平，健康恢復矣。</p>
<h3>肺病之有效療法</h3>
<p>肺病之猖獗，自古已然，於今為烈，人類在小兒期，卽已受其傳染，青年期以上，已有十分之九受其傳梁。被侵者之身體，普通雖能保持其健康，而使結核菌潛伏於身體一隅，然茍稍有不慎，遇有何等誘因，如精神過勞，食料不足等，以致營養衰退時，結核菌卽乘隙暴發，逞其猛威，於是肺病以成。自Koch氏發現本病之病原結核菌後，幾無人不知肺病乃一極危險之傳染病。故對於本病治法，迄無絕對有效者，尤以內服藥一層，收效穩安者極鮮。最近含鈣製劑之「補肺拿爾」，經多數專家實騐，皆認有確實的奏效，謂能達到結核治療之真髓。且為絕對的無菌內服劑。依嚴密的動物試騐之結果，本品不但全然無毒，並不帶任何副作用。無論肺病新久，體質贏弱，老齡壯年，服此皆宜，凡咳嗽氣急，胸痛隱隱，痰稠或薄，食慾不振，盜汗　熱等，均為本劑之適應症，因藥內含有鈣及其他珍補成分，是以喀血及血痰，立能止之。而本劑應用於一切呼吸器疾患，如氣管炎（久咳頑痰），哮喘，小兒百日咳，傷風咳痰等，均有顯著效騐。一個月內，確有根本痊愈之望。但患者每兼罹神經衰弱，貧血健忘，失眠心悸，男子遺精賢萎，女子月經失調，則可於進服本劑之外，同時並分別餌服男用「補體康」，治愈遺精，女服「補女容」，調整經期。卽獲體力旺盛，氣血充盈，體重增加，克秦美滿之效果。</p>
<h3>超格之治淋聖藥</h3>
<p>淋病之治療，根據舊來經騐，實一極為辣手之事。蓋欲取一時之效固不難，而圖能永奏根治者，斯不易矣。透膜殺菌療法，雖為學者所公認，然並非絕對的。因淋菌之最初傳染，乃留居於粘膜，至後潛伏日深，及　入後尿道，或流進身體他部，則非此種療法之所能為力，故透膜殺菌一法，僅適用於急性者較為有效。最近醫學界盛稱白血球增加療法Lencocyto-sentherapie，對於淋濁甚有功能，以其增加血中之白血球，使呈強力之全身抗毒滅菌作用，則淋菌自告根除。法郎府大藥廠依此最新唯一學理，採取特殊成分如蛋白體等，於特殊操作下，製為淋病聖藥「克淋儂」。服後確能使血球劇增，迅起喰菌機能，則無論留蘊何處之淋菌，均可掃蕩一清，因之：急性淋及慢性淋，與夫合併症睪丸炎攝護腺炎關節炎等症之男女患者，服此卽獲全瘳，徹底治愈。况藥性純良，一無流幣，與常藥不同。故購服時切勿誤信旁人夸言，受其朦混，而購廉價雜牌劣藥，致服後敗胃甚至發生生命之憂。所以務宜注意認明「克淋儂」三字，庶乎奏效穩妥。查歐洲各國，自經風　此藥以還，一年中患淋者竟减少百分之八十，且經此治愈，即可一切照常，永無再發之虞。</p>
<h3>天熱！白帶病益覺討厭！</h3>
<p>白帶病每逢天熱，益覺可厭。因夏天一切液體，最易揮發，白帶一病，平日已覺穢惡逼人，若一至熱天，則汗液與　內流出之白帶，交互發揮出一種難聞之特異臭氣。因此患者之糜爛程度益深，陰道刺痛，小便亦感不快。恒能引起月經困難。而為不孕之主因。</p>
<p>關於此病之治療，一般有名之醫家，每採用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，每晚以一片插入深部，次晨洗去，照洗應用，於三四星期內，卽可除凈白帶，消炎鎮痛平創而全治愈。惟因丈夫淋病傳染而來者，可內服「克淋儂」以除內部之淋毒，因體虛及發育不全而來白帶，可內服「補女容」。以強健體格，調整月經，雙方兼顧。故奏效尤速云。</p>
<h3>生殖力脆弱之原因療法</h3>
<p>旺盛內分泌機能良劑</p>
<p>現在文明雖日見進步，但人類之種族，則反日見退化，體格日見孱弱，固為吾人耳聞目睹者，然當事之患者之內心悲哀，更不可言喻，此為現代性病日益蔓延，青年人因乏性教育，而又一向生長於驕奢淫佚之迷人都市，性道德之墮落，更與日俱深，因而其生殖力益為脆弱可憐，往往因此而萌自殺之念者。大抵吾人體格之雄健，生殖力之旺盛，均有待於機能旺盛之內分泌，例如吾人生殖之腺內分泌機能之低下，致有生殖發育之不全，遺精，早洩，賢萎，女子月經不調等症，人生幸福，亦於是乎送斷，誠可嘆也。</p>
<p>梅倫氏因鑒於此等趨勢之可哀，乃孜孜研究，結果發明男用「補體康」女用「補女容」二藥。共原料係採取少壯期之勇健獸類睪丸及卵巢，分別提出荷爾蒙，更用最新科學方法配合而成。凡男女兩性生殖力脆弱，如男子房癆色瘵，精液稀薄，勃起力弱，女子月經失調，感覺遲鈍，因此兩性對於生殖力，必甚脆弱恒有久婚失孕之苦，如男服「補體康」女用「補女容」，即可於最短期中，將生殖系重新改造組織，內分泌機能旺盛，使其依然恢復原來青春之能力，故此二藥，實為挽救人類生殖力脆弱之特效劑，逈非一般荷爾蒙製劑所能及也。</p>
<h3>萬口同聲稱譽之淋藥</h3>
<p>淋病最難處置，而淋藥尤難選擇，世界各國關於此藥之研究，固甚熱烈，然語其成績，無有超過「克淋儂」者，此藥先後經過各大醫師之實地試騐，確為純粹殺滅淋菌，及增加全身抗毒力之高價藥品所製成。故服後能於最短期內，直接在粘膜部份發生殺菌之威力，且能旺盛全身抵抗淋毒之要素，故雖具強大之殺菌力，而無不良之副作用，良由質地提煉純凈，配合適當，非其他粗率從事者之可比擬，無怪世界各國著名醫師，藥於採用也。</p>
<p>此藥在各期淋病中，如急性期，慢性期，并由各期中所見之合併症，續發症之前後尿道炎，攝護腺炎，精囊炎，睪丸炎，關節炎，與多年之悄道狹窄等，莫不於數星期內，呈消炎鎮痛，利尿清濁等之作用。</p>
<p>據近來各地病家之報告，莫不萬口同聲，贊賞「克淋儂」一藥功效之宏偉，輕者在二三星期內治愈，重者於四五星期內，亦莫不克奏奇功。其成續為百分之九十七八左右，超過世界各國治淋藥之最高成績。惟購時務必認清「克淋儂」三字，庶不致誤。切勿誤聽旁人之言，購雜牌廉價之劣藥，以免發生危險也。</p>
<h3>胃痛之險症</h3>
<p>胃痛之症，一般係隱隱作痛，胸部脹滿，漸至如灼如刺，發痙攣性之疼痛，或起自胸部，或牽及背部，或放散至下腹部。若發至高度時。恒見人事不省。變為險症！但其誘因，固亦由慢性胃病轉變而來。故吾人若有胃病，即宜早治。又胃及十二指腸之潰瘍，幽門痙攣，肝臟輸血管　血，胃動脈硬化，心窩部脫腸等，皆為本病之原因。</p>
<p>治療方法，可服以少量之赤葡萄酒，並於胃部貼附熱水袋，或溫濕布。此為治標之法。治本須徹底改造胃之衰血憊機能，而賦活其細胞作用，並鎮靜其神經，則胃痛自除，而重新回復其常態。具此等偉異功能者，厥有「強胃精」一藥。蓋本劑實為胃藥中之翹楚。歐人早經賞用之。本品不特善療胃痛症。尤能療消化器障碍，腸胃諸病；故於胃弱食少，吞酸噯氣，嘈雜胸悶，嘔吐　心，時起放屁，大便秘結，或溏或瀉。見食生厭等，投之卽安。一掃而瘳！因本品為含酵　劑，並當有維他命甲乙丁三種重要成分，實治腳氣之別開生面良藥。其供營養之補給，更綽綽然而有餘。此以本藥與他藥相異之處，即在其具有為他藥所無之鑒類營養原，是以見效尤佳；而為珍異補品。</p>
<h3>淋病治騐珍聞</h3>
<p>久苦淋濁</p>
<p>患者周世琛君，罹淋病多年，精濁淋瀝，尿後見血，曰右例睪丸刺痛，致難步履，迭經醫治，而功效全無，嗣出發人王君介紹購服「克淋儂」，服未三星期，各項症狀已見轉好，如睪丸炎及小便刺痛等，皆已減去六七。仍繼服「克淋儂」至二星期後患全失，步履如常，且經血法檢騐五六次，並無淋毒反，乃確證明根治云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>我再有一個希望</h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>第一個希望是消弭內戰　第二個希望是通力合作</p>
<p>前幾天突然有個謠言，說兩廣軍隊有異動消息，我初絕對不認有這樣事實，定是交易所中投檢者所造的謠言，或是某方希望我國內亂所宣傳出來的空氣，不料到本月六日，報紙上也遮蓋不住了，各大報上多大書特書粤桂軍隊開入湘境，桂軍進駐永州後，又有兩師開抵郴州，粤機兩架，在衡下降等惡劣消息，我方明白眞有此事，不禁出了一身冷汗，因爲粤桂　軍出師的名目我很贊成，然不與中央同心合力，單獨行動，我不贊成，並且非但不能同心合力，而先開內戰，我更極端反對，因爲我國內戰開始之日，卽爲我國覆亡之日，可以斷言。</p>
<p>强鄰之耽眈虎視，日望我國之有事，惟恐我國之無事者已非一日，故不屑僞造種種謠言，煽動地方軍隊，破壞整個國家，坐收漁人之利，所謂以華制華之妙計，早爲路人所共知，若南方當局，不顧一切，完全意氣用事，先燃煮荳之萁，轉忘噬臍之禍，以國家爲孤注，視同胞若仇讐，卽使嬰孩之童，恐尙不肯出此下策，近日幸經各方之呼籲，函電交馳，聲嘶力竭，已得南方當局之諒解，前日報載，陳濟棠已有令前方部隊，停止前進，並勸李白兩氏，令飭入湘之桂軍，亦停止進行，靜候中央解决，昨日報載，兩廣已將到達永州的軍隊撤退，此種消息，固爲我國人民所極端希望者，在這風聲鶴唳，戰雲密佈之局面下，不數日間，竟得烟消雲滅，兇氛全除，第一我不能小佩服蔣委員長的豁達大度命令前方中央軍隊，向後移動，不予抵抗，第二我不能不佩服南方將領，申明大義，從善如流，數日之間，卽將前進的軍隊，次第撤退，這兩方公忠爲國的態度，捐除個人的意氣，態度光明，昭然若揭，這原是我第一個希望。</p>
<p>第二個希望，便是這次的戰禍，雖已消弭，但是雙方的意見，或猶未盡妥洽，我們進一步的希望要雙方當局，悉除成見，開誠布公，同心戮力，解除國難，處同舟共濟之勢，凛唇亡齒寒之誡，兄弟閱牆，外禦其侮，有訓昭垂，至可股鑒。現當二中全會行將開幕，渴望南方當局，速派大員蒞會，從長計議，通力合作，使內患旣經屛除，而外禍亦得消釋，這又是我人民所慇慇矚望者也。</p>
<h3>夜</h3>
<p>— 劉之明</p>
<p>我小時候是最怕夜的。天一落黑就不敢離開家人一步，但是鄕下的房屋都是既寬且大，一盞煤火燈所照到的地方僅是附近的一圈，而人的影子照射到牆壁上就特別碩大無比，如果那影子在我目光中偶然幻化成一種可怕的形狀時，我會用手掌遮蔽了眼睛大聲呌起來的。母親沒有方法醫治我的膽小，每天總是很早要我睡覺，因爲晚上她有許多事情要在燈下做作的，而我常常吵鬧着她。不能安心。</p>
<p>說起我的膽小也有原因的，有一個時候哥哥常扭着祖母講故事，那些故事都是可怕的殭屍，老虎吃人的傳說。其</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>實我們都是怕聽那類故事的，但是那種出乎意外的情節比之我家的廚子專門講呆女婿能引起我們的興趣，所以在怕聽又喜歡聽的矛盾狀態下，我就拖住了母親，哥哥拖住着女僕，聽完那種故事。後來祖母死了，可怕的影像還是遺留在我的腦海不肯散去，而且相反地濃厚起來：看見一個擴大的影子，會想到那是殭屍的化身；聽到一點什麼音嚮，會想到一隻老虎在窗二爬動。所以我最怕夜</p>
<p>父親在鎭上開着店，一個月至多有三四天住在家裏。我們弟兄兩個在小學畢業後，因爲我們個性的不同，哥哥是繼續求學，我帮助父親的店務。他的意思是就個性之所近可以收到雙方的效果的。但是哥哥到縣城去升中學，我到鎭上的店裏帮父親，家裏就祗有母親和一個女僕。鄕下的習俗家裏沒有一個男人總覺得不很妥當，起初父親想每天回家，母親却以爲父親年紀大了，日裏忙着店務，晚上還要跑許多路回家是太辛勞了，商議的結果是我住在家裏。鎭上的商店雖然歇市很早，不過吃過晚飯後，算淸賬目，也將要起更了。月色好的時候可以踏月歸家，平常總提了店裏燈籠，在昏黃的燈光下摸回家來。</p>
<p>走夜路對於我眞是個難關，小時候潛伏着的可怕底影像那時候彷彿都在我的四圍活動。月色好的時候，看着前面的黑影，會幻想到那裏埋伏着一個强人，（因爲那時候我的智識吿訴我不會有殭屍和老虎的。）他將在我走近時突然像一頭獵犬似的躥出來，至於那個强人要怎樣對付我，或者他爲什麼要攔住我的去路，我是不會想到的。月黑時更可怕了，因爲我看不見四周，聽到風吹草動的聲音，就以爲有人跟踪在我背後，而且幻想力特別豐富，甚至不敢注意手裏提着的那盞燈籠，回家時總是急出一身大汗。</p>
<p>幾個月過去，我習慣於夜行了。每天旣然一定要走那一段路，幻想就會减低了它的恐怕性，漸漸地習慣成自然，雖然難免要欺騙自己的時候，但是馬上有第二個念頭接上來，要是眞遇到了什麽危險，看他怎樣來對付我好了。記得有一次，一個更夫在樹下打瞌睡，遠遠望去，我認淸了是一個倦伏着的人影時，我故意提着燈籠在樹根下照個淸楚：那個更夫在睡夢中反被燈光驚醒來，他以爲發生了什麼危險，猛力地跳出來，那情形和我疑神疑鬼時大槪相像的。</p>
<p>現在住到都市來，幾乎每天遇着夜生活。都市的夜又是那樣明朗，磨天樓上的霓虹燈把夜點綴成一個美麗的世界我的臥室正靠近市中心，推開窗來，不會想到天空罩着夜的黑幕，正如在日裏一樣。就是午夜坐黃包車歸家，馬路上的路燈和廣吿燈都是終夜不熄的，兩旁的點心店正刮刮地敲着鍋子，而每個樓窗中還不停地送着無錢電裏的歌曲呢</p>
<p>雖然有時侯在黃包車上打着瞌睡，但是我沒有想到夜。夜已經和我的生活習慣打成一片，而且都市本來是稱爲不夜城的。（容窗散記之一）</p>
<h3>蠶農生活的調查</h3>
<p>— 方先</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<p>一季蠶桑，乃是農村中除子稻作之外的一宗主要劃業：農民在冬季里挪空的，以及一切當頭捐稅和秋收以前的生活，全須靠在這一季收入上面來敷衍過去。在從前，農民甚至還有因育蠶而致富的機會，可是年來華絲市塲已爲列强所奪，而人造絲又復充斥市上；於是絲價慘落，繭市便也永遠一蹶不振了。</p>
<p>現在，正是各地蠶農一年希望收穫的時候，我爲了要想知道一點蠶農的生活情形，所以特地到鄕下去跑了一趟。這里我想將所得的印象來簡路地寫在下面；不過，這里調査的中心地點，是把素以絲繭爲主要出產的洞庭西山作調査的根據。但，我敢說，這里雖祇着限於一隅，然而情形却是江南各地蠶農的一股現象。</p>
<p>在這周圍一百餘方哩的農村中，每家都須育蠶，從前飼育士種的時侯，每年祗育二次—春蠶，夏蠶—而已，—但後來改飼改良種後，便一年有三次四次—除春夏外還有秋蠶，冬蠶—了。以前，士種大都是自製及向新市，餘杭，或太湖上去購來的，種價却須看繭價高低與貨色多少而定。可是幾年前那里曾由幾個繭商來設立了一個蠶桑改良指導所，由蠶桑改良指導所的名義向各鄕戶去派種，其種價當時並不收取，俟賣繭時以八折扣算。但是最近却已改變方針，且販賣者亦爲幾個有勢力的人；鄕人凡欲飼養改良種者，須先於隔歲到他們那里去登記，並將所有種價（每張四角）預先繳淸，至翌年淸明邊憑登記證領種，惟種牌不一，優劣亦有差異，這是要看飼戶與他們的交情和「運道了。然而今年聽說已繳種價而領不到種的人很多，不過鄉人因懾於勢力，也祇敢怒而不敢言。</p>
<p>飼育方面，有自育及共育兩種，自育是領了種來由自己孵化的。所謂共育者，那是由販種者代孵，並育至頭眠時去領。但共育除了桑葉須由自己供給外，還耍津貼仙們每張六角至七八角的代育費—別處每張取費三角，然這道里竟要六角至七八角。</p>
<p>就拿今年的情形來說；每張改良種大的可捉眠頭（大眠）十五斤，需要食葉三百多斤，但如果是十足豐收的話，每張種產繭也不過三十斤左右，照現在每擔市秤收價三十元！這里改良種今年每百斤市秤三十元，土種二十元—計算，也祇有九塊錢。這假　吃的自己的桑葉倒還不必說，可是買葉吃的却要虧本了。因爲這里今年的靑桑葉價最低時也須兩元錢一百斤，而最高竟至三元多錢一百斤還沒地方去買。每張種單是吃桑葉已經要八九元錢，其　稻草炭火紙油人工等雜費，尙不在內。</p>
<p>據說：今年葉價貴的原因有三理，一，因爲幾年來一般蠶農由於育蠶虧本。故有的已將桑樹伐去，改植果樹，是以桑葉年見减少了。二，今年天氣氣候不正，桑葉產量不豐。三，去年秋蠶冬蠶的繭價突然提到了五十出零，因此一般蠶農滿以爲今年的繭價一定不會怎樣低的；於是，他們往年飼一二張者，今年便增加到三四張，甚至有飼十多張者。這樣，大家的飼額一多，桑葉自然也要感到缺乏了。揆之以上三種原因，葉價的昂貴，那是情理中的事情。</p>
<p>這里的繭市，本來一向是操縱在幾個七豪劣紳手里Ｒ　，所·雖說繭行有十多家。可是組織行動則似有一致的聯絡，一般蠶農們縱使明知被　們在剝削壓榨，但是又有仆麽方法能够跳去他們的掌握呢。</p>
<p>說到繭市的被操縱，便有許多人吿訴我繭行里黑幕情形。他們說：繭行里代收繭子，本來是一成回佣，可是行中們爲了討好繭商，並要提高回佣起見，便在蠶農方面儘量剝削。從前繭行里用的都是「大」秤，（蘇州十八兩，無錫十六兩，湖州三十二兩，而這里却是二十兩秤）自新制度量衡推行後，這里雖已改了市秤，但繭戶方面秤足了一秤（三十斤）挑到繭行里去，然而給，們秤過至少總耍短去一斤半斤的。况且，繭子從繭戶的籃里傾入似們的大扛籃里，再經過他們那麼一翻　操，有的便變了窨頭和癟繭：那時他們並不照市價分量合算，祇隨便喝一個數目，八元，八元半。蠶農們喊去了幾百聲先生，哀求了許多時侯，有時僥倖也許會加上二三角，但有時却得個不理不睬，或給他們不耐煩的說：</p>
<p>「去！去　不賣倒回去一」如果繭戶眞的倒了回來，想挑到另一家去多賣點，那麽不但不會多賣，而且或許會得到一固更重的打擊，因爲各行旣然聲氣相通的，他們的待遇當然不會兩樣，可兄這蘭子已經一次的播弄，「蕒相」上又滙了色，要希望多賣幾　錢，這差不多比求乞還要可憐。</p>
<p>不過，這請形亦不能一槪而論的；那些行里雇用的秤手，看貨旣然全是當地的地痞土棍，於實在經騐自然是談不上，然而舞弊却難免層出不窮；這在繭行當局和繭商們雖然明知，但爲了他們是「當方士地」，所以也是沒有辦法，莫說反正吃虧的還是一般蠶農們！</p>
<p>繭價的參差，這顯然是一種不平，像今年，蘇州改良種收價每百斤市秤爲三十多元，無錫最高有四十元，其他各地三十多元，至四十零不等，可是這里始終只有三十元左右。—今年產繭約一萬擔。</p>
<p>蠶農們一年的巴望，一個多月减食少寢的辛苦，然而換來的却是一串漫長的失望！採着繭的也要虧本，採不着繭的反增加一身債，但挪空的債，當頭，捐稅，生活…這些只是重重地壓在他們的心上！</p>
<h3>生活小景</h3>
<p>— 石風</p>
<p>幾乎每天都是這樣，我是在矛盾里過着生活。我需要休息，然而我不能休息。每天總是把我職務以內所要辦的事情辦完了才來家，來家以後就睡覺。眼看自己底身體支持不下來了，却沒有勇氣從人羣里跑出來休息一下。我望着鏡「要保持你底健康呀」！的誠摯的囑咐。然而，第一個人底話又響在耳邊了：「我們不是什麽名流，我們沒有休息的時間，用一切的精力去創造一座文化休息公園吧，那時，每個人都可以充分地休息」。因而，我不停地工作着。我一手抓着現在，一手推着他，使他走進一個新的境界里去。</p>
<p>「先生，你底房錢已經欠了…」</p>
<p>「先生，你底飯錢不繳，我們不包了，…」</p>
<p>我看着那些沒有一點情戀的臉，心裏有着說不出的難受。我只好推下去，說給他們一個日子。雖然我明明白白地知道那一天也是沒有辦法。到後來，我只好很晚很晚的時候才回到家里來，輕輕地走上樓梯，輕輕地開開我的房門。第二天一早再走出去。但是第三天我回來的時候，意外的他們沒有睡覺：一見我上工樓梯了，他們底臉全擺得那樣陰沉，一種黑暗的影子罩在他們底靈魂上，我對着這情况一句話也說不出來了：怎麽辦呢？還欠下去嗎？不的，不能那樣做！—</p>
<p>「老闆，我知道這是不對的，但是，…家里的錢這兩天總會寄來，我一定還你…」</p>
<p>今天又是日子了。然而，我沒有錢給他。朋友們都窮得沒有一個閑錢。家里還希望我能寄兩個去呢，那里有錢寄來呢？我只好晚晚的回來，像一枝被遺棄的烟蒂兒一樣獨自燃着火。我還想用這一點點兒火苗把生命的火炬點燃起來，向那「文化的花園」走去。</p>
<p>但是，擺在眼前的生活的鐵臉，使我怯弱的心有些顫慄。…</p>
<h3>提㧞</h3>
<p>— 舒芒</p>
<p>暗沈沈的光綫龍照在事務所的陰暗的屋子要，沒有風，沒有陽光，一切都是那麽可怕的陰沈。不論是光耀的白天，是昏暗的黑夜，灰黑的桌子上老是舖着那一縷萎黃中帶着慘綠的桌燈的光綫，幽微，無力而陰沈，像失掉了生氣的鬼火。而那些人。蒼白，瘦削，每張臉上都帶着同樣的悽慘，無聊，與疲乏的把自己底一切靑春，瞑想，與生活的歡欣無聲地埋葬在那兒。早晨，太陽旺盛而明耀地舖在大街上，而人從宿夜的惡夢中醒來，您忽地從刺着眼睛的陽光中行過，便馴服地鑽進那幽暗的地下室一般的所在，在那兒，紙冊與簿黑壓壓地堆積着，暗黃而微弱無力的陽光，可憐地從狹小的窗子中灌進來，灰塵密密地在裏面飄舞，看起來像一股水流。於是，人提着筆，寫着，算着，希望着，靑年的歡笑過去了，壯年的熱切也過去了，剩下的是一副枯瘦的形容，與單調地配在這形容上面的，一對萎鈍的，短視的，恐怖的，空空洞洞的，什麼也沒有了的眼睛。</p>
<p>——那是事業，那是工作，那是生活，那是……呀！</p>
<p>帶着三十歲上的疲乏，消沈，糢糊，惠生把那枝在手指的緊握中發了熱的「烏龍水」憤恨地放下，抬起頭來，覺到一陣暈眩，眼前飄浮着一些若隱若露的，綠的，黃的……雜色的光暈，心頭是難過得像要作嘔似的。接着，一口氣衝上來，便連聲地嗆咳起來了。那聲音刺耳地在空中浮游，不快意地響着。坐在惠生對面的那個胖胖的穿洋裝的二等科員，便厭惡地望了望他，接着又裝出了一付同情的，憐憫的神氣，縐了縐眉，敎訓似地說起來了；</p>
<p>「我看，王書記，你還是請個長假回去歇歇吧？那麼辛苦的工作，對於你是不行的。年紀靑靑的，身體要緊啊，至於……至於……」他想說「至於錢……至於生活……」可是他覺得這些是太難說，太不容易說得好聽了，便不自然地頓住話頭，裝起一種誠意的樣子瞧着那坐在他對面的，蒼白而可怕的臉，像急切想得到一個回答似的。</p>
<p>「不要紫不要緊……不過是傷了風，有點咳嗽罷咧……是的，事情辛苦，事情……然而上頭總知道的，總得要人提拔提拔就好了。得了人的提拔，那就什麽都會好一點了……」</p>
<p>那人擲了一眼輕視的眼光，隨卽大聲的「哈哈哈哈」地笑起來了。笑聲難受地刺在惠生底耳朶裏，他身上覺得有點！四年了呀，二十七歲的那年，好容易找友求親戚的弄到那麽一個位置：當抄寫，二十五塊錢的薪水，膳宿自理……在這樣的條件之下，還得維持着一個四口的人家。然而，「人是要靠人提㧞的呀！」四年了，依然是二十五塊錢，依然是「王書記」，依然對光了頭的科長恭敬地行禮。這些，全是糢糢糊糊地存在着。「提拔」，是要緊的，像比他遲來二年的小李，不是上個月已經升了二等科員了嗎？然而……人家却說小李有一個妹子，和科長攪得很好……那樣，人就給「提㧞」起來了。而自己……</p>
<p>希望與桌上的燈光一樣的黑暗而糢糊，身子一天天地不行了，這日子要延長到多久呢？……</p>
<p>門拍的開了，門邊露出一個光頭和一付黑框的大眼鏡，於是，習慣地，「王書記」又恭敬地站真情籽……</p>

<p>(London) Today's editorial in The Times stated that Westerners know very little about China's custom of warfare. Although South China and the Central Government are now at risk of civil war, the news received is extremely brief, and we need not waste time speculating. However, this situation is partly due to important economic reasons. Even if it can be rectified today to avoid trouble, it will still erupt one day. It would be surprising if the various factors driving the South China side did not include an element of anti-Japanese sentiment, unlike many events in Asia today that are made in Japan. It is an underestimation of the Chinese people's primary intelligence to believe that the Southern Army will engage in a serious war with the Central Army in order to force the Central Government to engage in a serious war with Japan. The dispute between the two sides will not be resolved by warfare. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin gave a speech on "National Spirit and National Survival" at the National Government's Memorial Week on the morning of the 15th. First, based on the Premier's will, he explained the theme in great detail. Second, he explained the importance of national spirit to national survival and cited various examples to prove the unchanging truth that "a nation must maintain its national spirit in order to survive in the world." Third, he stated that national spirit is a kind of national self-confidence, that is, a belief that the constituent members of a nation have in their own nation. With this belief, the nation can be united and exert great strength. Using this strength, the nation can actively seek its own survival and development, and passively resist the oppression of foreign nations. This is a kind of national spirit. In short, national spirit is the driving force for national survival. To cultivate national spirit, one must know the various advantages of one's own nation in terms of history and culture, so as to arouse faith in one's own nation and create strong national self-confidence. As a result, this nation can naturally survive forever in the world. Finally, he said that the root cause of our country's weakness is that our national spirit has declined and we have lost our national self-confidence. Now, to rescue our nation from its oppressed position, this erroneous mentality must be corrected as soon as possible. The method of correction is to know that we originally had good habits and that our knowledge and abilities are no weaker than those of others. We must have this belief in our own nation in order to revitalize the national spirit and strive for the nation's survival and development. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Issue of Lifting Sanctions Against Italy</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Since Italy announced the annexation of the entire Abyssinia last month, the League of Nations has encountered an unprecedented crisis. This crisis is whether the League of Nations will tacitly accept the facts created by Italy's use of force or prevent them. If it is recognized, it will be tantamount to slapping oneself in the face. If economic sanctions against Italy continue to be maintained, they will not be allowed by the facts. At this crossroads, the League of Nations has fallen into a very depressed state. Now, the special meeting of the Council of the League of Nations and the special conference of the League of Nations convened at the proposal of Argentina have been scheduled to be held at the end of the month. The issue of sanctions against Italy cannot but be resolved.</p>
<p>How will the League of Nations resolve the unprecedented crisis it has encountered? In other words, is the League of Nations prepared to intensify sanctions against Italy or lift economic sanctions? To explain this issue, it is necessary to first examine the attitude of the British government, because the League of Nations' implementation of economic sanctions against Italy can largely be said to have been initiated by the British. Since Italy announced the annexation of Abyssinia, the British government, with the exception of a few cabinet members, has been in favor of lifting economic sanctions, but it has not dared to make a clear decision due to the strong force of public opinion. Now, due to the development of the situation, the faction in the government that favors lifting sanctions has clearly taken the upper hand. This can be seen from the following facts: Former Foreign Secretary Hoare's return to the cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty. Hoare is a well-known pro-Italian. Last year, he drafted a peace proposal with French Prime Minister Laval to partition Abyssinia, but he stepped down after being attacked by public opinion. It is said that the condition for Hoare's return to the cabinet this time is to withdraw the British fleet from the Mediterranean. In a public speech on June 10, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain advocated lifting economic sanctions against Italy. Chamberlain is an important figure in the cabinet and is likely to succeed Baldwin as prime minister. His words can naturally represent the majority opinion of the government. In addition, there are quite a few government officials who advocate lifting economic sanctions. Now, not only does Britain intend to end sanctions against Italy, but other member states such as Chile, Argentina, and Czechoslovakia also have the same tendency. Therefore, it can now be said that the League of Nations conference to be held at the end of this month will largely decide to lift sanctions against Italy.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for the League of Nations' intention to lift sanctions against Italy is due to the selfishness and self-interest of the imperialists, who are unwilling to uphold the interests of small and weak nations. However, Italy's serious threat is also an important reason. Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi visited British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on June 9 and said that the implementation of economic sanctions by the League of Nations was intended to curb the Italian-Abyssinian war, but now that the war has ended, the sanctions have lost their purpose. If the League of Nations still decides to maintain economic sanctions at the end of this month, Italy will definitely announce its withdrawal from the League of Nations, which is something that Britain and France are extremely unwilling to see. At the same time, Italy is preparing to mobilize 800,000 troops and promote the conclusion of a military alliance with Germany and other means to threaten Britain and France to lift economic sanctions against Italy.</p>
<p>But will the League of Nations completely and unconditionally succumb to Italy's serious threat? This will not happen, because Britain also wants to save face. The tragicomedy that is scheduled to be played out in Geneva now is that on the one hand, the implementation of sanctions against Italy will be lifted, and on the other hand, it will still be decided not to recognize the legality of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. At the same time, it is also preparing to amend the Covenant of the League of Nations to avoid the recurrence of the same facts in the future. Such a trick is of course not welcomed by our peace-loving people. The British League of Nations Union has already held a meeting on the 14th to oppose the lifting of economic sanctions against Italy. British Labor Party leader Attlee also issued a similar statement of opposition. We can only wait for the facts to tell us how the situation will evolve in the future.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Plans to Strengthen Air Force to Counter Russia; Discuss Setting Up Special Department to Develop Civil Aviation; Exaggerated Propaganda of Soviet Military Expansion</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The idea that civil aviation is the second army of the air force in the event of war is a thing of the past. The Soviet Union is actively preparing to realize this plan, with civil aviation itself as the air force. It is reported that the national air force mobilization project has accommodated 18 million people last year, and 9% of the soldiers in the country are reservists who have completed air force education. There are about 70 aircraft manufacturing factories, with an annual manufacturing capacity of no less than 2,500 aircraft. The Japanese Ministry of the Army believes that with such developed Soviet aviation, it is absolutely impossible to win a modern war even with all efforts to strengthen the army and navy air corps. It is determined to actively strengthen national defense and expand civil aviation. After various studies, it has reached the conclusion to establish a large organization such as an aviation ministry or an aviation institute to actively assist the development of civil aviation. It is currently in consultation with the naval authorities. After obtaining the navy's consent, it will jointly submit a request to the cabinet for approval. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Next Year's Army and Navy Budget to Exceed 1.4 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The government ministries are currently drafting next year's budget proposal based on the resolutions and recommendations of the temporary parliament, preparing to submit it to the cabinet meeting on July 3 for review. Those who pay attention to the current situation are extremely concerned about the national defense budgets of the army and navy. It is reported that the army, in view of the current international situation, has proposed a comprehensive national defense policy, so next year's national defense budget will reach as much as 700 million yuan, attempting to complete the strengthened national defense in the next four or six years. The first step is to increase the military strength in "Manchuria", enrich aviation and air defense equipment, and strengthen the ability to fight against Russia. As for the navy, the main focus is to build battleships, improve aviation power, expand naval and land forces, and carry out a southward policy. Its budget must also exceed 700 million yuan. (China United Press dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reports from the Tokyo Asahi and Yomiuri newspapers, the Soviet Union has recently continued its acts of aggression. The Japanese army should increase its combat power, with North Manchuria as the first line of national defense. After maintaining equal strength with Russia, it should establish a demilitarized zone and demand that the Soviet Union withdraw its troops. The two newspapers also published the army's views on this issue as follows:</p>
<p>The army authorities are convinced that the best way to make the Soviet Union abandon its provocative behavior is to strengthen Japanese military equipment. They are now actively preparing military power. A 50-kilometer demilitarized zone should be established on the Russian-Manchurian border, and the Japanese-Manchurian army and the Soviet army should withdraw their troops from the zone.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union claims a non-aggression treaty, but on the one hand, it is building fortresses on the border and assembling troops. Japan knows that the true intentions of the Soviet Union cannot be assured by this treaty. If a demilitarized zone is established, all kinds of pending issues between Japan, Manchuria, and the Soviet Union can be easily resolved.</p>
<p>The most important thing in the Soviet Union's Far East policy is to obtain an ice-free military port in the Far East, and to use the communization of the Far East as the basis for communizing the world.</p>
<p>The Japanese army will not move a single soldier without the order of the Emperor, so there is no such thing as the Japanese army challenging. The army should strengthen its national defense in preparation for unforeseen events. The army should adjust the Russian-Manchurian relationship with a strong military background, so it is easy to resolve border incidents. (Domei dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons to Debate Foreign Policy on Thursday</h3>
<p>Decision on Attitude Towards Italy</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons today that the government plans to hold a debate on new foreign affairs on a selected date. He will explain the government's views on collective action to be taken at the Council and General Assembly of the League of Nations. The date of the debate will probably be Thursday. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons convenes this afternoon, Foreign Secretary Eden may make a speech involving the issue of sanctions against Italy. The British government's definite attitude on this issue will not be clearly explained until the House of Commons discusses foreign policy next Monday. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) It is almost certain that the British government will take action on the issue of lifting sanctions against Italy. The diplomatic reporter for the Morning Post claimed that "When the British cabinet meets this Wednesday, it will definitely take a definite decision on the following two issues: lifting sanctions against Italy and reorganizing the League of Nations and reducing its current powers." However, it is very doubtful whether Foreign Secretary Eden can continue to serve after these two measures are decided. The diplomatic reporter for the Manchester Guardian expressed the same view, but clearly adopted a reserved attitude, saying, "The British government's attitude should be regarded as not formally decided until the cabinet meeting is held on Wednesday. As for the extraordinary meeting of the Council of the League of Nations to be held on the 26th of this month, if all countries are unwilling to make recommendations on the issue of lifting sanctions against Italy, then the British representative should propose ending the sanctions or organizing a committee to re-examine the sanctions issue. This is more credible." In addition, regarding the reorganization of the League of Nations, the newspaper also published a commentary, believing that this should be based on the following two principles: regional organization of security agencies, and the conclusion of a Mediterranean Convention, with Italy in a leading position. It also said that there are no terms of exchange between lifting sanctions and Italy's participation in the Mediterranean Convention. Finally, the newspaper also considered it inaccurate that the original position of the United Kingdom in the Mediterranean had been weakened, but said that the United Kingdom might reorganize its original position, and the situation on Malta is no longer what it used to be. It may be necessary to establish another naval base in another area that is not easily attacked by the enemy, for example, to replace it. In addition, a naval base should be added to Cape Town in the South African Federation as a new route to India. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Seeks Opportunity to Demand Recovery of Former Colonies</h3>
<p>Before British-Italian Relations are Clear, He Does Not Want to Announce Policy Prematurely</p>
<p>(Berlin) It was learned today that Chancellor Hitler is now seeking an opportunity to demand the recovery of the former German colonies. Although the United Kingdom is currently exerting pressure, demanding that Germany explain its policies, Hitler will not reply prematurely before thoroughly studying the various issues. Hitler is currently paying the most attention to the following points: the competition between Britain and Italy for hegemony in the Mediterranean, the relationship between Britain and Italy, and the staff meeting of the Little Entente countries held in Bucharest. Therefore, Hitler does not want to announce his policy before British-Italian relations are completely clear so that he can decide which country to be close to. Hitler told Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that he was against the restoration of the Austrian Habsburg dynasty. (National Press dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<h3>Success of the French Peaceful Revolution; People's Front Rallies and Demonstrates; Celebrating the Victory of the Labor Movement</h3>
<p>The Labor Strikes of the Past Two Weeks Have Generally Come to an End; The Machines in the Factories are Hummin Classed Picturesque Re-Emitting Thick Smoke</p>
<p>(Paris) The various parties of the leftist People's Front held demonstrations in all major cities throughout the country today to celebrate the election victory. There were thousands of people marching in formation on the streets everywhere, led by the French tricolor national flag and the Third International red flag. The situation was good and no accidents occurred. It is scheduled to be held again on July 14, which is French National Day. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This strike movement was launched by the Lavallette Electrical Metallurgical Factory in Saint-Ouen, a suburb of Paris, on May 27. Afterwards, the various factories in the metallurgical industry followed suit, extending to other industries, and evolved into a huge labor strike. By 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM this morning, the major metallurgical factories in the capital area and the Seine province had resumed work one after another. The chimneys were again seen spraying thick smoke, and the sound of machines in the factories was again heard. All technicians and workers had returned to their posts, and the employees in the office were also working at their desks. After the end of the metallurgical industry strike movement, it is no exaggeration to infer that the huge labor strike that has lasted for half a month will come to a complete end. The strike movements in other industries such as construction, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, electricity, and hairdressing have also come to an end. However, workers in the shipping industry, department stores, insurance, clothing, and perfume industries, as well as funeral home employees and jockeys at racetracks, have not yet signed agreements with the capitalists, but the end is not far off. As for several small factories in the metallurgical industry, they have not yet resumed work because the wage issues are still to be adjusted and resolved. It is expected that an agreement will be reached today and a satisfactory solution will be obtained. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>"Buffalo" Stadium: Grand Gathering of the Left Wing</h3>
<p>Crowds Numbering Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Communist Party held a grand gathering at the "Buffalo" Stadium to celebrate the victory of the Left-Wing People's Front in the election. The number of participants was estimated to be in the tens of thousands. The weather today was clear and sunny. From 2:00 PM, the stadium was already packed with people. Above the crowds, only flags could be seen fluttering. A viewing stand was set up in the center of the lawn for the orchestra, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and journalists. After the opening ceremony, Communist youth athletes, children's choirs, various striking committee representatives, and veteran delegations marched in formation. The striking committee队伍 mostly held flags, indicating the names of the factories to which they belonged, and announced their victories. As the parade passed by, workers from various industries applauded and cheered for a long time. The sounds of songs and victory cheers echoed each other, creating a passionate atmosphere that words cannot describe. On the podium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, red flags and tricolor national flags fluttered in the wind. First, the Secretary of the Communist Party, Qi Dong, delivered the opening speech, briefly stating that the purpose of today's gathering was twofold: first, to celebrate the victory of the election; and second, to celebrate the victory of the labor movement. He also stated that the slogan of the Communist Party is "A Free, Powerful, and Happy France" and "Establish a French Soviet Republic," and so on. The Secretary of the United General Confederation of Labor, Frasson, continued to speak, saying that the working class had strictly adhered to discipline and bravely fought during this strike movement, which was commendable. He also said that the members of the United General Confederation of Labor had increased from one million to two and a half million. Therefore, the victory of the labor movement could also be said to be the victory of the General Confederation of Labor. Currently, many workers who believe in Catholicism and belong to the Croix-de-Feu (right-wing veteran organization) have joined the General Confederation of Labor, which is most welcome, and so on. Qi Longsky, a left-wing member of the Socialist Party, said, "The unified action of the parties in the Left-Wing People's Front is what we should especially praise. In the future, both domestic and foreign affairs should be changed accordingly. The reason for this is the unity of action. However, reactionary elements are now secretly engaged in sabotage, and we must guard against them and prevent their conspiracies from succeeding. The Socialist Party will propose to the Communist Party to form a coordination committee to maintain close contact among the parties in the Left-Wing People's Front," and so on. Next, the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, namely the Secretary of the Communist Party, Du Gero, stood up and spoke, briefly stating that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party became one on July 15 last year. Therefore, the red flag of the Third International and the tricolor flag of France could finally be carried together. He also said that the Communist Party must loyally support Prime Minister Léon Blum. Du Gero then addressed the middle class, saying, "Reactionary elements are slanderously slandering the left-wing platform, trying to frighten you. You must know that the purpose of the labor movement is not destructive, but only to ensure the food and clothing of workers' families. What workers have diligently worked for is not allowed to be taken away by others, and raising prices and devaluing currency are also not tolerated by workers. The middle class can rest assured," and so on. Next, another leader of the party, Fan Yang Gudu Liye, read the party member's oath, briefly saying, "We solemnly swear to work hard so that the whole of France is united and that a free, powerful, and happy France is realized. This is what we desire, and this is what the Communist Party should do," and so on. At 8:00 PM, the meeting was adjourned. The proceedings of the day were smooth and no incidents occurred.

<h3>French Interior Minister's Speech: The First Achievement of the New Cabinet's Measures</h3>
<p>Stating that the Status of the Proletariat Will Become Stronger in the Future</p>
<p>After being promoted to Minister of the Interior, Salongro, the Mayor of Lille, France, returned to the city from the capital at 4:35 PM today. The citizens of the city gave him a warm welcome. He then delivered a speech at the City Hall, briefly stating, "If the current government can make people of all levels feel like brothers and sisters in all aspects, and the relationship of unity is realized, then its purpose can be said to have been achieved." He then mentioned the recent strike movement and the agreement reached between labor and management on the 7th of this month, saying, "This is the first time that labor and management have sat down to discuss and resolve disputes freely. During the strike, not a single tool was broken, not a single machine was damaged, and not a single drop of blood was shed, and it finally ended in success. Capitalists will not be able to look down on everything in the future. This can be called a peaceful revolution. After this struggle, millions of workers have won, and the French Republican system and the status of the proletariat will become stronger." Then, referring to right-wing armed groups such as the Croix-de-Feu, he said, "I have submitted a bill to the State Council to prevent any group from endangering order and engaging in armed activities to oppose the Republican system. In short, what we have achieved in the 20 days since we took office is more than what previous cabinets have achieved in 20 years. The People's Front cabinet will definitely exist for a long time, and its victory is also guaranteed," and so on. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Venezuela Amends Laws: General Strike Calms Down</h3>

<h3>China's Industrial Decline: Unequal Treaties Are the Culprit; Smuggling in North China Causes Significant Losses; China's Labor Representatives Speak with Pain</h3>
<p>(Geneva) During the debate at the International Labor Bureau Conference today, China's labor representative, Mr. Zhu, stated that the decline of Chinese industry is due to frequent natural disasters internally and the constraints of unequal treaties and imperialist aggression externally. Zhu also criticized the imperialists in the capitalist world. He then asked the public to pay attention to the frequent occurrence of factory disasters, especially in the Shanghai Public Concession. The severe state of the recession is caused by the dumping of foreign goods, which damages the sales market of domestic products. Smuggling in North China, in the nine months up to April 1, is estimated to have caused China losses of 25.5 million yuan. The situation of 10 million overseas Chinese compatriots is even worse than that of domestic labor compatriots. The International Labor Bureau should investigate the conditions for recruiting Chinese workers, and the Board of Directors should travel to the Far East to strengthen the relationship between China and the International Labor Bureau. Zhu supported the proposal to convene an Asian Labor Conference. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Zhu Xuefan, the labor representative of China at the International Labor Conference, talked about the fact that China is undoubtedly extremely backward in production. Now that all countries in the world are striving for economic recovery, China is still shrouded in recession. Goods imported from various countries into China have penetrated into the interior, and even small villages have been invaded by foreign goods, which has greatly impacted China's handicraft industry. In the past nine months of smuggling in North China, customs losses reached 25.5 million yuan. As a result, not only is China's small industry, which is in its infancy, being destroyed, but also the legitimate trade of various countries is being undermined. Domestic and international markets are suffering losses. Capitalists, relying on unequal treaties, exploit the low wages of Chinese workers and enjoy various conveniences, while the lives of workers are greatly affected due to economic depression. Especially in the concessions, factory inspections are impossible, making their lives even more dangerous. It is hoped that the conference can provide relief, and it is hoped that the authorities of the Labor Bureau can conduct on-the-spot investigations in the Far East to obtain more opportunities for contact.

The Interior Minister and the Minister of Justice are both members of the committee. Recently, those affected by the strike are engineers. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Brussels. This strike first broke out in the port of Antwerp and then spread to various metallurgical factories, munitions factories, and mining areas in the city of Elsda. It happened to coincide with the re-election of the House of Representatives, and the Cabinet tide followed, with no one in the central government, so the labor unrest took the opportunity to spread. However, the main reason is that after the devaluation of the Belgian Franc, workers' living expenses have increased, but wages have not increased accordingly. Coal miners in Hezhi City, Selan City, Els City, and Charleroi City have announced a general strike since yesterday and have put forward four demands: 1. Increase wages by 10%; 2. Labor unions still represent workers and sign work contracts with employers; 3. Implement a 40-hour work week; 4. Wages are paid as usual during annual holidays. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Paris) A correspondent from the Paris Evening News in Berlin has recently learned of shocking news, which the newspaper has published. It is claimed that after Captain Röhm, the former commander of the National Socialist Stormtroopers, was ordered to be shot by Führer Hitler during the purge movement on June 30 the year before, 20,000 of his party members vowed to avenge the deceased. They formed a secret organization called the "Röhm Revenge Society," which specializes in assassinating stormtroopers. "The existence of this secret organization is now beyond doubt. Corpses of stormtroopers are often found in secluded places, with the letters PP written in chalk on their chests. Most of the victims are members who shot Röhm the year before. The exact number is unknown, and the scope of the assassinations is expanding. All the stormtroopers are terrified. The Propaganda Department has issued an order to all newspapers to prohibit the publication of news about the assassinations. Many National Socialist leaders, including Führer Hitler, have received threatening letters. It is heard that on the 30th of this month, the second anniversary of the purge movement, the "Röhm Revenge Society" plans to launch a major operation with special actions.

<p>(Moscow) Walter Duranty, a reporter for the "New York Times," wrote in "Pravda," "The new Soviet constitution has the most significant meaning, not only for the 170 million people of the Soviet Union, but also for the whole world. The new constitution is absolute proof of the intelligence and correctness of Soviet policy, and it is also the final proof of the political talent of the great leader of the Soviet Union. He will be the creator of the new constitution in history, and the supreme leader of the socialist victory represented by the new Soviet constitution." He continued, "The democratic nature of the new constitution can be called the charter of freedom for every honest citizen of the Soviet Union, which is also of great significance to the United States." Duranty also said that the new constitution proves that the Soviet Union has overcome various difficulties in socialist construction, and the socialist iron and steel industry has been firmly established. Finally, he pointed out that the constitution was promulgated at a time when reactionary forces occupy a huge position in the world, and the war crisis is unprecedentedly tense.

<h3>Inauguration of the New Building of the Chinese Academy in Frankfurt, Germany</h3>
<p>Ambassador Cheng Presides Over the Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>Special Arrangement of Museum Exhibits</p>
<p>Sufficient to Represent Modern Chinese Life</p>
<p>Frankfurt: The new site of the Chinese Academy here was inaugurated today by Ambassador Cheng. A large number of prominent figures gathered at the ceremony, including Chinese students from the University of Frankfurt, the mayor of the city, and other prominent figures from the art, science, and industrial communities. The chairman, former German Minister to China and current President of the Academy, Mr. Boekger, delivered a speech, welcoming the guests and thanking the German government for its assistance, which enabled the Academy to achieve such success. Ambassador Cheng Tianfang and Ambassador Doddmann then delivered speeches, both stating that the mission of the new location should be to increase friendship between the two countries. Afterwards, the guests visited the museum to view the antique exhibits.</p>
<p>The Chinese Academy was founded in 1925 by the famous scholar Mr. Wilhelm. Since Mr. Wilhelm's death, its scope has expanded daily. All kinds of Chinese art have been gradually collected, making it now a very magnificent museum. However, the Academy is not named as a museum because its purpose is not to display Chinese antiques, but to represent "modern Chinese life." From this perspective, this type of exhibition is rare. The antiquities collected here are sufficient to represent ancient Chinese art and cultural life. There are many types of exhibits, but each item is exactly the same as it is used in China today. Among them are family sacrificial items, furniture, and utensils, arranged in the same way as Chinese family decorations, which is completely different from the display method of ordinary museums. In addition, there is also a Chinese-style study, bedroom, and living room, the stage set of Chinese drama, and all kinds of ancient costumes, etc. The second floor is a Chinese library with 12,000 Chinese books and 2,500 books about China. This kind of display is very eye-catching to Europeans, and the impression of China on the visitors is also very good. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<h3>Conversation of the Director of the East Asia Bureau of Japan, Mr. Kuwashima, After Arriving in Beiping</h3>
<p>Acknowledges the Puppet Organization of Eastern Hebei Should be Abolished, But Claims Japan Has No Intention of Invading China</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Kuwashima Kazue, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, arrived in Beiping from Tianjin on the evening of the 13th and stayed at Room 108 of the Beijing Hotel. At noon on the 14th, Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, hosted a banquet at the Nanhai Hotel in the Summer Palace specifically to entertain Kuwashima, as well as former Japanese Vice Chief of Staff Sugiyama Gen, Chief of Staff of the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Headquarters Nagami Toshitoku, Matsumuro Takayoshi attached to the Garrison Headquarters, and invited Qin Dechun, Zhang Zizhong, Wang Yitang, Feng Zhi’an, Liu Ruming, and other military and political figures to attend. The banquet ended around 2 o'clock, followed by a garden tour. Around 3 o'clock, they returned to the city one after another. Nagami returned to Tianjin at 5 pm that afternoon. Kuwashima was scheduled to formally meet with Mr. Song on the 15th to discuss everything. On the morning of the 16th, he will go to Zhangjiakou for inspection and return to Beiping that evening. On the 17th, he will go to Jinan and Qingdao to visit Han Fuju, Shen Honglie, and others separately, and then go to Nanjing and Shanghai to visit important figures of our government. After finishing these matters, he will take a ship back to Japan from Shanghai. A reporter visited Kuwashima at the Beijing Hotel at 9:30 am on the 14th, and they talked for about an hour. Here is a record of his conversation: "I previously worked in Tianjin (as the Japanese Consul-General) for two and a half years. Later, I was transferred back to Japan to work in the Foreign Ministry, still handling East Asian affairs. However, due to the heavy workload, I was unable to leave my post, so it has been three full years since I last came to China. In these two years, China has undergone many changes, and the situation is also very different. This visit to China is to see the Chinese situation, what changes have occurred, to serve as a reference for future work. The places I plan to visit this time are Hebei, Tianjin, Beiping, Zhangjiakou, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, and Shanghai. After completing the inspection, I will return to Japan.</p>
<p>After arriving in Tianjin, I met with Commander Tashiro, Chief of Staff Nagami, personnel from the Tianjin Japanese Consulate General, and old Chinese friends in Tianjin. The talks mostly revolved around the recent situation in Hebei. In Beiping, I also hope to have time to meet more people. The more people I meet, the more opinions I will hear. I will probably meet with Chairman Song formally on the 15th. As for the North China situation, to what extent it should reach, and how it can be resolved, because I have only met with a portion of friends, and have not yet met with members of the Political Council, I have no opinion to express at this time. I am very sorry. However, I believe that not only North China, but also the Chinese government should strive for the happiness of the people and the stability of people's lives. When the Japanese government works for this kind of thing for the Chinese government, it will definitely be able to provide assistance. I also believe that Sino-Japanese diplomacy should also take striving for the happiness of the people and the stability of people's lives as the standard. This is my general impression of North China. When I obtain more detailed information in the future, I will have more specific opinions.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it seems a bit abstract and empty. However, when I was working in Tianjin, I had this kind of feeling. For example, Hebei is a cotton-producing area, and Japanese spinning mills need a lot of this raw material, which has always come from England, the United States, and Egypt, precisely because the Chinese cotton seeds are not good. China and Japan are neighboring countries. If China improves its cotton seeds, then Japan should purchase them. This will also greatly help the stability of people's lives. Japan can also provide assistance economically. Now, China already has slogans like 'Plant Cotton to Save the Country,' and it is said that China is currently exporting cotton. Japan also uses it. This is really a good phenomenon. Another example is Shanxi, a province with inconvenient water conservancy. If water conservancy can be developed, agricultural production can naturally be developed. When I was in Manchuria, there was a well-drilling engineer named Shimizu. At the invitation of Mr. Yan Xishan, I introduced him to work there. Now, I hear that 300 wells have already been dug in Shanxi. This is of great benefit to the farmers of Shanxi, and Japan also benefits from it.</p>
<p>As for North China's diplomacy, because North China is a region of China, in principle, it should be handled by the Chinese government. However, because the Japanese side's understanding of North China is slightly different from that of the Chinese government, there is no difference between the Japanese military and diplomatic officials regarding North China policy. The Japanese government has a consistent policy, using this policy to deal with the situation in North China. Although North China has a special situation, the purpose of handling diplomacy is the same. It is not necessary to divide responsibility between the Foreign Ministry or the military. The North China region is special and changes very quickly. If the central government has a solution, the situation would not be as it is now. Therefore, this responsibility lies with the Chinese authorities."</p>
<p>When Kuwashima said this, the reporter asked what was special about the special situation he was referring to in North China. Kuwashima said, "Because I don't have time for a long talk, I will simply say that Japan is currently undertaking the defense responsibility of 'Manchukuo' and is responsible for the political, cultural, and economic development of 'Manchukuo.' The border between 'Manchukuo' and China is North China. Therefore, the special situation lies in this."</p>
<p>The reporter further inquired about the Eastern Hebei issue, asking if a resolution was possible. Kuwashima said, "Regarding this matter, I will only express my personal opinion. The Eastern Hebei organization should, in principle, merge with the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and should be abolished. It cannot exist permanently." However, when it can merge and to what extent it can be abolished is still under study and cannot be announced at this time. I believe that the Japanese increase in the North China garrison has no intention of invading China. Talking about adjusting the relationship between China and Japan, this is a very important issue. The two countries are studying it at all times. I believe that the relationship between the two countries must be adjusted, and it will definitely be adjusted. Now, I would like to hear everyone's high opinions on adjusting the relationship." The reporter stated that we, the people of the whole country, have many opinions on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Due to time constraints, I will only offer one of the most important points for reference, which is the hope that all issues between China and Japan should be resolved through diplomatic channels and legal procedures, to achieve genuine Sino-Japanese amity and cooperation. If force is resorted to, it will not be easy to completely conquer China with its vast territory and large population. Kuwashima expressed his agreement to this, saying that he is willing to work together and understand each other on the principle of taking into account the position and facts of both sides (14th).</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Aquatic Products Experiment Station Requests the Establishment of Aquatic Product Refrigeration and Transportation</h3>
<p>Planning to Establish Four More Refrigeration Warehouses</p>
<p>Utilizing Railroads to Transport and Sell Fish</p>
<p>Annual Profit of 40,000 Yuan Possible</p>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Since its establishment, the Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Experiment Station has spared no effort in developing and improving basic fisheries work. To promote fisheries construction, increase coastal fisheries production, expand fish sales, and seek exchange of Zhejiang and Jiangxi specialties and economic cooperation, a detailed plan has been proposed to establish refrigeration and transportation. It is said that the authorities will adopt and implement this plan. The plan is recorded below:</p>
<p>"China's fishery industry has been affected by the economic downturn, leading to increasing economic hardship in fishing villages and a falling price of fish. Aquatic products are not only subjected to the pressure of dumping by foreign goods, but also difficult to preserve due to their nature, making it impossible to transport and sell them elsewhere. Therefore, their price drop is more severe than other commodities. To save the situation, it is necessary to find ways to increase fish prices. The most effective way to increase fish prices is to prevent the import of foreign aquatic products and expand the sales of domestic fish. The former method is difficult to achieve because China's tariffs have not yet reached complete autonomy. The latter method is within our ability and should be carried out quickly to save the fishery industry from danger. Regarding this, the station has previously proposed a canned food manufacturing improvement plan, which has been approved for implementation. To implement this proposal and popularize the fish market, we will again propose refrigeration and transportation methods to keep fish fresh for transportation and sales to distant places. Everyone knows about the refrigeration method, but operators are limited to the coast, and very few have factories in the interior. Refrigerated transportation is even less developed. This is indeed a major reason why fish sales are not smooth and fish prices are low. In fact, inland areas of this province, such as Jinhua and Quzhou, only have freshwater fish because marine fish cannot be transported in, and fish prices are as high as two jiao per catty, while saltwater fish prices on the coast are only seven or eight fen, a difference of several times. In other coastal areas, such as Yongjia, fish prices are higher than Dinghai and Ningbo because they are farther from the fishing grounds. If refrigeration and transportation are established, allowing cheap marine fish to be transported everywhere, then on the one hand, the sales of fish will be expanded, and the value of fish catches will naturally increase, benefiting fishermen directly. On the other hand, inland residents can enjoy cheaper and more nutritious marine products. This province does not have many livestock products, but it is extremely rich in aquatic products. If refrigeration and transportation are established, people can eat fish to replace livestock. The economic benefits to the province will be significant. The methods and budget are listed below: Establish a refrigeration warehouse in each of Ningbo, Hangzhou, Jinhua, and Nanchang, together with the station's existing Dinghai refrigeration warehouse, for a total of five refrigeration warehouses. Each warehouse will have an average capacity of approximately 300,000 catties, capable of storing a total of 1.5 million catties of fish. During the fish season, when fish prices are low, collect large quantities of fish in Dinghai and Ningbo and transport them to various refrigeration warehouses for storage, waiting for prices to rise. The fish stored in the Dinghai and Ningbo warehouses will not only be transported to Hangzhou, Jinhua, and Nanchang at any time, but also sold to various coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang when fish prices are high. Refrigerated fish in Hangzhou will be sold exclusively downstream of the Qiantang River. Fish in Jinhua will be sold upstream of the Qiantang River. Fish in Nanchang will be sold in various areas of Jiangxi Province. For transportation methods, ordinary ships will be temporarily used in coastal areas. For land transportation of each warehouse, it is proposed to request Hangzhou-Ningbo and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railways to jointly set up an insulated car, which can carry about 40,000 catties of fish. As for the transportation between inland towns, it is proposed to set up a green car in each of the Hangzhou, Jinhua, and Nanchang warehouses to transport fish. Budget: Operating costs: Total expenditure of 217,200.00 yuan. Recurring costs and operating expenses: Total expenditure of 247,360.00 yuan. Business income: Total income of 285,000.00 yuan."</p>
<h3>Suzhou National Goods Promotion Movement</h3>
<p>The Wuxian National Goods Year Implementation Committee, in order to promote national goods, held a National Goods Promotion Conference at 1:00 PM on the 15th on the second floor of the National Goods Shopping Center in Beiju. National goods merchants swore an oath. To arouse public interest in using national goods, a national goods speech competition was held, followed by a national goods fashion show. Eleven participants participated in the show, all of whom were social flowers in Suzhou. At that time, national goods manufacturers such as the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company distributed national goods products. Participants were very enthusiastic. A national goods food exhibition was also set up at the Yong'an National Goods Shopping Center for people to visit. The Dachunghua National Goods Company in Guanqian Street also participated in the promotion at the beginning, but suddenly stopped halfway. Therefore, the county party headquarters ordered the company to remove the words "National Goods" from its signboard. On the same day, representatives from various schools in Suzhou were dispatched to inspect whether the national goods shopping centers were purely national goods.</p>
<h3>Branch Line Laborer Cuts the Station Master</h3>
<p>Zhang Mutao, the station master of the Suzhou Railway Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, was attacked by a railway branch line laborer, Yang Licai. Yang Licai was suspended from his duties by the railway bureau due to poor performance. Harboring resentment, he set up at 7:00 PM on the 14th and, armed with a sharp axe, cut station master Zhang's hands and arms in many places at Zhang's residence on the Qianwanli Bridge. The rickshaw puller successfully captured the assailant Yang Licai and sent him to the police station for investigation. After being injured, Zhang Mutao was immediately sent to the Gengsheng Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were superficial and not life-threatening.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Smuggled Coal from Liujiang Transported to Wuxi</h3>
<p>Smuggled coal from Liujiang, Linyu County, Hebei, was sold by unscrupulous merchants from Chengwu counties who organized a distribution center to sell to the interior. Ruikang transported 3,000 tons of smuggled coal to Jiangyin. After several twists and turns, it has been unloaded. However, the people of Chengwu are extremely excited. The chambers of commerce and coal industry guilds of each county have respectively informed their colleagues to refuse to sell it. Yuanda Coal Company in this county even sent someone to Cheng to negotiate the sale of smuggled coal. On the day before yesterday, 500 tons were unloaded from the warehouse near Bao'an Road in Jiangyin and loaded into fourteen barges. It was loaded and transported to Wuxi at 4:00 PM. The Jiangyin Coal Industry Guild quickly sent a telegram to the Wuxi Coal Industry Guild to pay attention. Yesterday (the 15th), the smuggled coal arrived at Wuxi but had not yet been unloaded. The customs inspection office in this county has dispatched personnel to investigate the truth and deal with it.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Prepare to Start Operations</h3>
<p>The overseas silk market has been soaring in the past week because of the start of the American summer sales and insufficient inventory, leading to smooth sales. The Shanghai silk market has also been rising in price for days. Because of the rising silk market overseas, silk manufacturers in this county unanimously expect higher prices. The number of sales has been very high in recent days. Moreover, with the listing of spring cocoons this year, the factories that have stopped production are preparing to start operations. The Silk Factory Association held an extraordinary meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of the factory opening. It was resolved that the association should notify the factories preparing to start operations to send the names of shareholders and managers, the names of representatives attending the association, the number of silk cars, and the amount of capital to the association for registration within five days for verification and consultation. At the same time, the local business tax bureau sent two official letters to the Silk Factory Association, urging them to convene their colleagues as soon as possible to truthfully declare the business tax within five days for verification. After the Silk Factory Association approved the letter, it has been forwarded to each factory for compliance and reported before June 20.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Jiangdu Overturned by Wind</h3>
<p>Wuyi No. 1 Yidu Ferry boat of Yinshakou in the third district of Wujin County. On the 13th, it followed the practice of carrying passengers to the port of Jiangbei. When sailing, it carried more than 20 passengers. When sailing to the east Xin'gang area of Jiangbei boundary in the river, it was about 10 o'clock. Suddenly, the sky was covered, the wind was strong, and heavy rain suddenly fell. The river waves suddenly rose. The shed of the Yidu ferry boat was broken by the storm, and the boat capsized. All 20 passengers fell into the water. Fortunately, a Zhenjiang Shenji ship passed by the place and rushed to rescue them. More than 10 of the people who were rescued were rescued and taken to Jiangbei to return to their hometowns. The rest who were missing could not be salvaged. When the wind and rain calmed down, they tried to salvage the overturned boat. A middle-aged man and woman were found in the boat, both of whom had drowned, which was very tragic. The Yidu ferry boat was driven back to Yinshakou. The head of the township, Sun Yuanzhang, submitted a report to the Procuratorate of the local court about the accident and the discovery of the corpses. Prosecutor Guan Junjie went to investigate the situation on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Agricultural Warehouse Closed</h3>
<p>Since the current manager Shen Xianheng presided over the Jiaxing County Farmers Bank, he has been planning to develop the business with all his strength. Therefore, offices have been established in various towns, and agricultural warehouses have been established, which has greatly facilitated the mortgage of agricultural products by villagers. Now, because the summer season is approaching, the agricultural products stored in the warehouse should be forced to be redeemed. The business meeting decided to close all strict agricultural warehouses in Youchegang, Xincheng, Xinpu, Wangdian and other places from the 16th. The goods that have not been redeemed will be extended to the summer solstice, and will be auctioned and compensated after the expiration date. On the other hand, the bank will consider the local situation and organize the storage of agricultural products for mortgages, so that farmers can temporarily use beans, grass seeds, vegetable seeds, and local yarn for storage and mortgage.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Yangjingjingkou Section Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>The section of the Yangjing Highway from Yangzhou to Xiannv Town has been very convenient for travelers since it was opened to traffic on the 31st of last month. Now, the roadbed from Jingjiang to Kouan has been built, and it will be opened to traffic on the 16th. The entire line to traffic will still take some time because all the bridges between Kouan and Xiannv Town have not yet been completed.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Friction at the Zhen Lantern Festival Caused Trouble</h3>
<p>Xindai Town in this county was eager to catch up after the urban area held a lantern parade three times to promote the prohibition of opium smoking. It contacted various agencies and tied up countless colorful lanterns. The townspeople of the town were accustomed to playing magical dramas and welcoming gods at the fair. When they heard about the lantern parade, the townspeople almost all persuaded them to join. So, tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, dragons, all kinds of lanterns, weird and strange, have nothing to do with the prohibition of opium smoking. The shooting stars and firecrackers used for worshipping gods were added, and a large rack of flames was released in the Nan Niu Chang in the middle of the city. The north of the field was directly opposite a bridge. The crowd all wanted to squeeze onto the bridge to watch. There were already more than a hundred people on the bridge. They were squeezed back and forth and could not avoid it, so they refused to exert force. Suddenly, the crowd was noisy, and the stone railings on the bridge, along with the audience, fell into the water. The number of injured is unknown. It is only rumored that seven people were the most seriously injured. The next day, it was changed to be held in Cangji Baitou. There were even more ignorant people watching the fireworks, and the surrounding crops were completely trampled, causing no small loss.</p>
<h3>Haizhou A Rebellious Son Killed His Biological Mother</h3>
<p>Jiang Xiaobo, a resident of Wuxiaoyuan in the third district of Guanyun County, is now in his forties. His profession is as a boatman. Because his business has been depressed recently, he has been heavily in debt. He sold his original sailboat, with a selling price of 165 yuan. His mother, Zhang, is over 60 years old. She usually relies on boat life. Now that it has been sold, she is not only helpless, but also has no place to settle her clothes and coffin in the future. She asked her son Xiaobo to ask for the price of the boat to be used as the cost of clothes and coffins. However, Xiaobo refused to give her a penny, causing the mother and son to quarrel. Xiaobo hated his mother for asking him for money, and at night the other day, he held a kitchen knife and killed his mother. After the incident, Xiaobo wanted to escape, but was discovered by his neighbors, who tied Xiaobo and sent him to the third district office. Lu District Chief has prepared a document today to send him to the county government for legal action.</p>
<h3>American Counselor Visits Lianyungang</h3>
<p>Stealwell, the counselor of the American Consulate in Beiping, took a bus from Xuzhou to Lianyungang the day before yesterday, and stayed at the Huayuan Hotel that night. According to Stealwell, this visit to Hong Kong is of a reference nature, and to visit the scenery of the East and West Lian islands. Once the tour is completed, he will take a boat to Qingdao, and then take a car from Qingdao back to Ping.</p>
<h3>Japanese People Survey the Salt Area</h3>
<p>Fujisawa Kou Sen, a Japanese resident in the British Concession in Tianjin, and Ishii Masayasu, a Japanese resident in Saramicho, Dalian City, visited Tianjin, Sichuan, Qingdao, Shandong, Huaibei and other salt regions to inspect the production situation. At 4 pm on the 10th, they arrived in Xinxie via the Longhai East Express from Bengbu. They stayed at the East Asia Hotel. The Japanese also carried a letter from Zheng Manager of the Tianjin Changlu Salt Transport Envoy Office to Yao Manager of the Huai Bei Salt Transport Envoy Office in Guanyun. The two Japanese went to the Guanyun Salt Production Area to inspect the situation on the 11th, and then took a car back to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Commercial Profits and Losses Before the Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>Because the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, the commercial accounts in Hangzhou City need to be settled. However, due to the impact of the recession and the decline of the market, most of the businesses are losing money rather than making profits. Because of the slump in the silk and tea markets, the money industry is extremely limited in its lending, only the Bank of China, the Transportation Bank, and the Agricultural Bank have a slight surplus, while the rest can barely cover expenses or even suffer losses. The business of other industries is also far from as good as before, and the number of stores closing down is increasing day by day, making it very difficult to maintain.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Re-elects Chairman</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce implemented re-elections last year, Cheng Zhenji, the president of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, succeeded as standing committee member and chairman. However, Mr. Cheng was invited by Anhui Province to serve as the president of the Anhui Provincial Bank and the director of the Shanghai sales office of the Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee, and could not attend to these responsibilities concurrently, so he firmly requested to resign. This has already been approved. In recent days, the various committee members of the association have been exchanging opinions, and it has been internally decided to promote Standing Committee member Huang Youtong. A meeting is scheduled to be convened on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss and finalize the decision.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Silkworm Cocoon Market Sets Fixed Closing Date</h3>
<p>Xiaoshan is a silk-producing area. This year, silkworm farmers have produced a large quantity of green cocoons. There are a total of twenty-seven "Lan Hang" [silk filature guilds] in the county. The cocoon markets that purchase local varieties of cocoons have already stopped weighing and purchasing. The cocoon markets that purchase improved varieties started weighing and purchasing on the 1st and will continue until the 10th, a total of ten days. It is planned to uniformly stop weighing and purchasing from the 15th. However, the goods arriving this session are crowded, and each cocoon market has exceeded the original registered amount. Furthermore, because of the closing of the local cocoon markets, there is still a large quantity of fresh cocoons in the countryside, so they can only reel silk themselves. Also, the cocoon price was initially high but later became low, and the villagers suffered great losses. If methods are not devised to provide relief, more and more households will become discouraged. The future of the silk industry will definitely not be optimistic.</p>

<h3>Fifteenth Health and Hygiene Campaign Opens Yesterday Morning at the People's Education Center</h3>
<p>Director Li Leads a Major Clean-up with Broom in Hand. The Focus of This Campaign is Children</p>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, the Municipal Health Bureau, the Public Concession Health Department, and forty-two organizations jointly organized the Fifteenth Health and Hygiene Campaign. It opened at 10:00 AM yesterday at the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road in Ximen. First, Mayor Wu, representing Director Li Tingan, performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony, followed immediately by the opening ceremony. Then, Director Li and others led police officers, security teams, Boy Scouts, and service personnel from various districts in a parade and major cleanup. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The scale of this Health and Hygiene Campaign is grand. The Party and national flags are crossed in front of the main gate, adorned with pine and cypress, and below is the artistic inscription of the four characters "Health and Hygiene Campaign." Upon entering, one sees health advertisements, colorful in red and green. At the middle gate bridge, three advertising kiosks are erected by the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory and the Wuhe Factory. On the left side of the open space is the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Health Exhibition area, and on the right is the auditorium. The walkways are fenced off with bamboo railings to conform to the New Life Movement's rules of walking. Finally, there is the Public Concession Health Department exhibition. There is a decorated archway on the walkway in front of the Dacheng Hall, with the four characters "Protect Our Health" inscribed by Mayor Wu, next to a couplet that reads, "Do not allow sorrow and joy to reach extremes; one should ensure a balanced diet." In addition, security team police officers and Boy Scouts from the Civil Girls' High School are also maintaining order in the venue.</p>
<p>Participating Representatives</p>
<p>Those attending the opening ceremony included Mayor Wu (represented by Li Yan'an), Tong Hangbai of the Municipal Party Department, Pan Gongzhan of the New Life Movement Promotion Association, Li Tingan, Director of the Health Bureau, Cai Jingjun, Director of the Public Security Bureau (represented by Hong Qi), Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau (represented by Zhang Binghui), Ji Zhangjian, Commander of the Security General Corps (represented by Lin Zhisheng), Zhu Erden, Director of the Public Concession Health Department (Qiong Siden), Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Cao Zhigong of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Mao Zhixiang of the Dental Association, Tu Kaizheng of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Li Xiaohua of the Anti-Smoking Investigation Commissioner's Office, Li Weiye of the Wusong Health Office, Yun Jihua of the South Shanghai Health Office, and over a thousand people including conference staff members Zhu Jiarang, Shen Gao, Zhu Xiaochun, Wu Zhongyao, and Yin Yong.</p>
<p>(International Photograph)</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>At the second gate of the venue, there was a colored ribbon, guarded by Girl Scouts holding sticks. As the time approached 10:00 AM, Director Li cut it open, and the opening ceremony was declared open. Immediately afterward, Committee Member Tong, Section Chief Shen, Section Chief Zhang, and representatives from all sectors successively inspected the venue. First, the slogan "Health and Life" in large red characters caught the eye. They then inspected the venue in five departments. After inspecting the dental hygiene section, the representatives proceeded to the auditorium to take their seats. The opening program began with the Public Security Bureau Music Corps playing music, singing the Party song, and giving the highest salute to the portrait of the late President. After the chairman respectfully read the President's will, President Li began his speech, which was broadcast throughout the entire venue through loudspeakers. Subsequently, Committee Member Tong, Director Pan, and Qiong Siden, the representative of the Public Concession Health Department, also gave speeches. Finally, male and female students from Huaguang Elementary School sang health songs, followed by music and photography.</p>
<p>General Content of Speeches</p>
<p>Chairman Li Tingan reported, in brief, "Ladies and gentlemen, our Shanghai Fifteenth Health and Hygiene Campaign is organized by the New Life Movement Promotion Association, the Health Bureau, the Public Concession Health Department, and over forty organizations. The difference between this session and previous sessions is the cooperation between this association and various organizations such as the New Life Movement Association. Preparations have taken months to achieve today's phenomenon, all thanks to the enthusiastic support of various organizations. This is the special feature of this conference. Because this year is Children's Year, all work is focused on children. However, the program has been researched and found to be more extensive than previous sessions, including: 1. Infant Health Competition, 2. Children's Hygiene Competition, 3. Children's Clothing Competition, 4. Mother's Day, 5. Anti-Spitting Campaign, 6. Health Guidance, 7. Fly Eradication Campaign, 8. Centralized Training for Food Establishments. As for the duration of the conference, it is also longer than before. The 16th is Children's Toy Hygiene Guidance, the 17th is Children's Dietary Hygiene Guidance, the 18th is Entertainment, the 19th is Children's Health Competition, the 20th is Sunday, the 21st is Children's Hygiene Speech Competition, the 22nd is a day of rest, the 23rd is Factory Hygiene, the 24th is Children's Life Guidance, the 25th is Anti-Spitting, the 26th is Children's Oral Hygiene, the 27th is Mother's Day, the 28th is Youth Day, the 29th is rest, and the 30th is the closing ceremony. As for the issue of funding, it is different from the past. Previously, the Municipal Government allocated 1,040 yuan, and the shortfall was raised freely. This year, there is only 500 yuan of funding, but there are many participating organizations, and advertising costs also take up a considerable amount, but it can generally be maintained." Next, Tong Hangbai gave a speech, in brief, "Distinguished guests, today is the first day of the Health and Hygiene Campaign. I am participating on behalf of the Municipal Party Department. The Health and Hygiene Campaign is one of the New Life Movement, and it is closely related to the survival of the nation. Looking at the extreme danger facing China today, many people are still unaware of hygiene. Neglecting the Health and Hygiene Campaign makes it difficult to engage in the national salvation movement. From this, one can understand." Finally, the representative of the Public Concession Health Department gave a speech, the content of which is omitted for brevity.</p>
<p>Parade and Street Cleaning</p>
<p>After the photography, the procession was organized. Various organizations and representatives, as well as service groups from various districts and the public, numbering about a thousand people, each with a broom, set off towards Ximen. Director Li, Committee Member Tong, and others led the way, with the Public Security Bureau band leading the vanguard. Arriving at the Ximen Memorial Tower, brooms were waved in unison, a spectacular sight. The parade participants took the area around the tower, which was hung with a banner that read "Shanghai Health and Hygiene Campaign Major Cleanup," as the final destination and dispersed in all directions.</p>
<p>Torrential Rain</p>
<p>As soon as the conference ended, a sudden wind and rainstorm struck, and pedestrians were unable to escape, getting drenched. The Health and Hygiene Campaign venue, constructed from reed mats and oiled paper, was attacked by the storm, and many of the exhibits were also damp. According to the manager, fortunately, the exhibits were not damaged. After the rain cleared and the sky cleared, the exhibition resumed as usual.</p>
<p>Public Exhibition</p>
<p>Yesterday was Children's Clothing Hygiene Guidance Day. The Municipal Government, China-West Radio, and Gospel Radio broadcast lectures. From 1:00 PM onwards, visitors came in a continuous stream. The first part of the exhibition, regarding physiological hygiene, included detailed explanations of the ten-month-old fetus model. Disease prevention and rules for healthy habits were also available for public viewing.</p>
<p>Today's Program</p>
<p>Today is Children's Toy Hygiene Guidance Day, organized by the China Benevolent Children's Society. In addition to lectures in the auditorium, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Finance Bureau Director Xu Fu, and Zhu Erden (Dr. G. H. Gordon) of the Public Concession Health Department have been invited to broadcast lectures on the radio.</p>
<h3>Yang Dezhao's Second Trip to Beijing Undecided</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports, according to Beijing telegrams, that Yang Dezhao, the Nanjing-based representative of Chen Jitang, the Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong, is scheduled to visit Chiang Kai-shek again on the 15th. However, according to Mrs. Yang's statement to the reporter, although Yang plans to visit Nanjing again, the date of departure has not yet been determined. Mr. Yang is the Nanjing-based representative of Director Chen, and transportation between Nanjing and Shanghai is very convenient, so he will go to Nanjing immediately when necessary.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Loan. Fund Management Committee Meets Yesterday</h3>
<p>The first meeting of the Bonded Trustee Committee for the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway's 6% Gold Bond Loan was held at 3:00 PM on June 15 at the Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration office. Attendees included Chairman Zhang Gongquan, Minister of Railways, Committee members Song Ziliang, representative of the China Construction Bank, Davidson, representative of the China-British Bank, and Safu Jun and Lin Zhaotang, representatives of the Ministry of Railways. Pan Guangjiong, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Railways, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, and He Molin, Deputy Director, were also present. The heads of the accounting office of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, Si Douya, and Deputy Director Mo Jiefu served as secretaries. The meeting was chaired by Minister Zhang, and the order of the meeting was as follows: 1. Chairman's opening remarks, 2. Approval of the rules and regulations of the Bonded Trustee Committee, 3. The Director of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, designated by the Minister of Railways, has the authority to deposit the loan proceeds in the bank and should be filed for record, 4. Acceptance of the accounting officer recommended by the banking syndicate and submission to the Minister of Railways for appointment (Mo Jiefu, Deputy Director of the Accounting Office of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, was recommended by the banking syndicate and concurrently appointed as the acting director of the accounting office), 5. Grant the secretary the authority to purchase record books and other urgent expenses. The speeches of Chairman Zhang and the representatives of the China Construction Bank and the China-British Bank are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman Zhang's Speech</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I am deeply honored to be the chairman of the first meeting of the Bonded Trustee Committee for the completion of the 6% Gold Bond Loan for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway of the National Government of China. This loan is the result of the sincere efforts of the China-British Bank and the China Construction Bank. After several twists and turns in the past and in the current difficult situation, the bonds were finally issued. I am deeply grateful for their sincere cooperation and courageous handling. The Ministry of Railways, in its determination to restore railway credit, took the opportunity to negotiate this loan agreement to establish a deeper friendship with the China-British Bank and a new and closer relationship with the China Construction Bank, which is very gratifying. The organization and establishment of this committee is very different from previous methods, which is sufficient to indicate the deep mutual trust and cooperation between the two sides. We engaged in the railway industry feel that the reason why the four banks, HSBC, Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, cooperated so closely is that the driving force is not the pursuit of ordinary commercial profits, but the firm belief in railway investment. This matter is tantamount to obtaining a resolution of confidence for those in charge of railways. I believe that the issuance of bonds is extremely important. We have not publicly issued railway bonds for many years. Those who purchase bonds must be able to clearly distinguish between the market price and the true value of the bonds. The true value of the bonds does not fluctuate with the ups and downs of the market price, but must be viewed in terms of their nature, that is, whether railway administration is sound and whether debts are fulfilled on time. Only by earnestly implementing these points can we hope that the public will actively subscribe. We have high expectations for the construction of domestic railways because the recovery of the Chinese national economy is extremely important for railways. The railways in China are not only the center of the economy but also a profitable investment. Given China's vast territory and abundant production, the existing railway lines are definitely not enough to meet the demand. Therefore, Chinese railways are a great investment market. I hope that the administration of the railway bureau can achieve the greatest efficiency with the most economical expenditure and that this committee will faithfully perform its duties and gain public trust, just as the price of the old Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway bonds rose to 102 yuan. In short, China needs railways, and the opportunity is unmatched elsewhere in the world. I believe that this loan is nothing more than the vanguard of many similar investments."</p>
<p>Committee Member Song's Speech</p>
<p>The main idea is that today's first meeting of the committee is extremely important. It is the first time for China and foreign countries to cooperate and jointly invest in Chinese railway construction, and China expects many railways to be built. It is hoped that all future projects can be carried out in this joint investment method. The committee does not hope to be a supervisory body, but wishes to assist the railway bureau. The current situation of the railway bureau is very good, and it is hoped that it can further increase revenue and reduce expenditure in the future, so that finances can be further consolidated. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are the richest regions in China, and the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways are located in a connecting position. Unfortunately, a section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has not yet been connected, which is a pity. Therefore, the name of this loan is to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. It is hoped that the construction project will be completed soon and the entire railway will be connected.</p>
<p>Davidson's Speech</p>
<p>The main idea is that he was deeply impressed and interested in listening to the chairman's speech just now. The railway loan has been interrupted for many years. The establishment of this railway loan is tantamount to further consolidating the existing friendship between China and the United Kingdom. This loan is the vanguard of the same loan in the future. My intention is the same as the chairman's. The signing of this loan agreement and the issuance of bonds on the market are clearly an expression of the China-British Bank's trust in the National Government of China and the Ministry of Railways. The current loan agreement is extremely important. We must strive for economic efficiency in construction costs and strive for great effectiveness. In the future, we must also strive to fulfill principal and interest payments as scheduled. I feel that under the chairman's leadership, all financial difficulties can be resolved. I wish you success.</p>
<h3>Feng Ruitang and Tang Haian Arrive in Shanghai on the Same Ship Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Feng Talks About the Absolute Obedience of the Guangdong and Guangxi Armies to the Central Government. Tang Talks About Having a Plan for Reforming the Guangdong Silver Dollar System</p>
<p>Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, and Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, jointly traveled from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the Dollar Steamship Company's Hoover President, arriving here at 10:40 AM yesterday, berthing at pontoons 11 and 12. Tang Zhaoshi, secretary of the Jianghai Customs, and Wang Zhinan, secretary of the Songhu Military Preparations Command, welcomed them. After disembarking, Feng and Tang transferred to a small ship and crossed the river, landing at the new customs wharf at 11:15 AM and going directly to Tang's residence on Fuxing Road for rest. In the afternoon, they will go to meet with Finance Minister Kong to report on the situation.</p>
<p>Feng's Remarks</p>
<p>Feng Rui's visit is by order of Chen Jitang, Pacification Commissioner of Guangzhou, and Lin Yunhai, Chairman of Guangdong Province, to explain to the central government. According to Feng, the Guangdong and Guangxi armies are absolutely obedient to the central government and are now withdrawing to the rear as ordered by the central government. Outside rumors are not true. I am here by order of Director Chen and Chairman Lin to explain to the central government and will visit Finance Minister Kong to discuss sugar cane and construction issues. The rumor that Guangdong Province has sealed up banknotes is also untrue. Guangdong Province has issued more than 17 million yuan in banknotes, and the cash reserve is more than 200 million yuan. Sun Jiaze did not travel with me. I plan to stay in Shanghai for a short time and then go to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Tang's Remarks</p>
<p>Tang Haian previously went to Guangdong by order of Finance Minister Kong to discuss the silver dollar system and anti-smuggling issues. This time, he returned north with a plan for reform and will present it to Finance Minister Kong for guidance. According to Tang, regarding the silver dollar system, the results of this trip to Guangdong were quite satisfactory, and a specific plan for reforming the silver dollar system was drafted and submitted to Finance Minister Kong for instruction in preparation for implementation. The silver stored in Guangdong will be transferred to the central government in exchange for legal tender to avoid outflow. Tang was unwilling to express any views on the current situation and anti-smuggling issues.</p>
<h3>Representatives from All Sectors Commemorate the Passing of the Late President in Guangzhou This Morning</h3>
<p>10:00 AM at the Municipal Party Headquarters Auditorium</p>
<p>Guomin News reports that today is the fourteenth anniversary of the passing of the late President in Guangzhou. The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city is scheduled to convene a memorial service for representatives from all sectors at 10:00 AM today. All cities and towns are required to fly flags at half-mast for commemoration. The authorities of the Chinese and Foreign Concessions have taken strict precautions to prevent disturbances to public order by unscrupulous elements. The following is a brief history of the passing of the late President: In 1922 (Gregorian calendar), the late President moved his troops from Guangxi to the Northern Expedition. Because Chen Jiongming colluded with Wu Peifu and others to obstruct the rear, he returned to Guangzhou in April. Chen fled to Huizhou and instigated his subordinates to launch an armed attack on the Presidential Palace on June 16. The late President then boarded the Yongfeng warship and led the navy to quell the rebellion, confronting Chen in the Guangzhou River for about a month. He telegraphed the troops who had entered Jiangxi to return to Guangdong to quell the rebellion, but they were unsuccessful. On August 9, he left Guangzhou for Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Prohibits Blank Sale Transactions</h3>
<p>Transactions Must be Signed by Exchange Brokers</p>
<p>Nanjing Telephone, In order to prohibit blank sale and purchase transactions in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce ordered the Shanghai Stock Exchange Federation that thereafter, the brokers of each exchange should, for the sale and purchase entrusted by the trustee, whether buying or selling, or delivery, should pass through their respective exchange, and the transaction order should be completed by the exchange in accordance with the provisions of the internal statute, and signed by both parties' brokers to complete the transaction, and must not be violated. The order should be forwarded to all exchanges and brokers' associations for compliance.</p>
<h3>Banks Provide Loans to Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Sectors</h3>
<p>Bank of China The Bank of China, in view of the devastation and widespread suffering in Jiangxi since the communist bandit disturbances, and the near complete destruction of farmers' productive capacity, has specifically partnered with the Jiangxi Rural Cooperative to launch rural production loans to provide relief to poor farmers and increase production efficiency. It has now designated the eight counties of Ji'an, Jishui, Yongfeng, Xingan, Chongren, Linchuan, Dongxiang, and Le'an as pilot locations. In addition to money, the loans also include fertilizer, seeds, and agricultural tools to farmers. The loan amount is quite large and will be used for universal relief depending on the needs of the farmers.</p>
<p>China Agricultural and Industrial Bank The Bank of China and the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, in view of the bankruptcy of the rural economy in Zhejiang Province and the difficulty of farmers' livelihoods, jointly launched agricultural warehouse mortgage loans at the invitation of the Provincial Department of Construction in early November of last year to provide relief. The first batch of loans totaled 500,000 yuan. According to sources in the financial sector, the funds were originally borrowed from the two banks by the Provincial Department of Construction for a term of eight months. It is expected that both principal and interest can be recovered in full by the end of June of this year.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Bank The Jiangsu Bank's head office in this city, in order to prosper industry and commerce and revive the market, decided to launch small industrial and commercial loans within the scope of the head office in accordance with the decisions of this year's business meeting. According to reporters from the Industrial and Commercial Society, in order to achieve a comprehensive plan and popularize it throughout the province, in addition to submitting the draft loan method to the provincial government for record and requesting that the administrative organs of each county provide assistance, it also sent letters to its local branches and agency treasuries to actively prepare for implementation. After the provincial government approves the loan, it will be held separately at any time. It is reported that industrial and commercial firms requesting loans must obtain an application form from the bank and must be guaranteed by local chambers of commerce and trade associations before a loan can be granted.</p>
<h3>Telephone Association Asks Chamber of Commerce to Propose at the General Assembly to Discuss Telephone Rate Increases</h3>
<p>Advocating a Uniform Three Cents Per Call</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee, considering that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce of this city will hold a general meeting of members on the 20th of this month, sent a letter to the Chamber yesterday, asking that the issue of telephone rate increases by the Shanghai Telephone Company be included in the agenda for discussion at the general meeting in order to seek a solution. The original letter is recorded below: "Regarding the issue of telephone rate increases in the Special District, although the public associations of this city have repeatedly declared their opposition, the company, relying on the operating franchise granted by the Public Works Department, intends to increase the official interest rate by one cent and refuses to accept it, resulting in a stalemate that has not yet been resolved. Previously, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter stating that the solution to the case requires first investigating the company's income to determine whether it exceeds the official interest rate by one cent. Our association has informed users to collect bills separately in preparation for the entire negotiation. However, telephones are a tool for commercial communication. The illegal rate increase by the company this time has had a deep impact on commerce. Your Chamber is the hub of commerce, and it has previously sent a letter stating that it would submit the issue to the general meeting of members on June 20 for discussion. As the meeting date is approaching, we are sending another letter requesting that the case be included in the agenda for discussion in order to reach a uniform rate of three cents per call, regardless of the basic rate or the number of calls exceeding the limit. Furthermore, the Public Works Department's unauthorized rate increase for public utilities without obtaining the consent of taxpayers is a disregard for public sentiment and should be discussed together in order to safeguard the public interests of citizens in the Special District. The matter is of great importance and we hope you will pay attention to it."</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Held Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Passed the Budget for the 24th Year</p>
<p>The Provisional Municipal Council of this city held a regular meeting yesterday. Councilors Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zaibochi, Wang Yiting, Xu Yongzuo, Xu Xinliu, Qin Runqing, Guo Shun, Lu Jingshi, Feng Bingnan, Liu Zhanen, etc. attended. The meeting was chaired by Speaker Wang Xiaolai. After the report was completed, the discussion proceeded. 1. The Municipal Government sent a letter requesting a review of the second-level budget for the 24th year. Resolved, the case was passed with additional comments for notification. 2. Regarding the case of increasing land value tax and house rent in this city, the Municipal Government has sent the Ministry of Finance's review situation and the 24th year's budget to the meeting one after another.

<h3>Silver and Money Industries Announce Refusal to Accept Loans Secured by Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Those Who Knowingly Accept Tax-Evading Goods Will be Severely Punished in Accordance with the Criminal Law on Receiving Stolen Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Kouqian (Buckle Money) and Silver Industry Association received an order from the Ministry not to accept loans secured by tax-evading goods. Yesterday, it issued a public announcement to its member firms to comply with the following document: "Yesterday, we received a Yuan Telegram from the Ministry of Finance, addressed to the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association. An investigation has revealed that receiving and purchasing tax-evading goods should be subject to criminal penalties in accordance with the Criminal Law on Receiving Stolen Goods, which has been presented to the Executive Yuan for approval and forwarded for record and notification. Recent confidential reports indicate that many smugglers are mortgaging tax-evading smuggled goods to silver and money firms to facilitate transportation. If firms accept such mortgages, it is equivalent to receiving tax-evading goods and is a criminal offense. Strict warnings should be given to prevent this. Therefore, we are issuing this telegram to inform all firms that when accepting goods as collateral, if the goods are imported, in addition to providing the storage receipt and bill of lading at the original port of import, a tax payment receipt obtained from the customs office should also be provided. For goods transported from the original port of import to various places, in addition to providing the storage receipt and bill of lading, a certificate from the local Chamber of Commerce or trade association should also be obtained, stating that the goods have been issued a transportation permit by the customs office and approved for transportation and registered with the association. If the above certificate cannot be obtained and there is suspicion of tax evasion, the bill of lading and storage receipt should be detained and reported to the local government or directly submitted to the Ministry for investigation. If any firm knowingly accepts tax-evading goods as collateral, the managers of the firm will be severely punished in accordance with the Criminal Law on Receiving Stolen Goods to deter wrongdoing once the facts are verified. In addition to sending separate telegrams, we are issuing this telegram for compliance and notification to all member firms (banks) for your information."</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Federation Submits a Request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government: Please Exempt Silk Cocoons from Detention</h3>
<p>Detailed Explanation of Dissatisfaction with Central Pricing Due to Three Reasons</p>
<p>Grant Passage First to Those Priced Above 19 Yuan</p>
<p>Sample Testing Only for Those Below to Reduce Losses</p>
<p>The Joint Federation of Zhejiang Provincial Silk Cocoon Industry Associations of Lianzhu Lane, Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai, after repeatedly receiving letters from various local industry associations reporting that the Management Office of the Cocoon Control Committee of Zhejiang Province is detaining all spring silk cocoons that do not meet the central price,</p>
<p>resulting in unbearable losses, the federation, based on the situation, yesterday submitted a document to Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating, "Submitted for the matter of requesting exemption from detention. Our association has repeatedly received letters from various local industry associations stating that this year's spring cocoons, those whose purchase price does not meet the central price, are uniformly detained by the Management Office of the Control Committee, resulting in unbearable losses, etc., entrusting our association to request release and transportation. Our association investigated the situation and found approximately three points, which we respectfully present to your Excellency: The quality is too poor. The original price list was based on the degree of silk reeling loss as the standard. The difference in silk reeling loss this year compared to last year is such that each picul has increased by as much as one hundred and several tens of catties, some have increased by seventy or eighty catties, and the minimum is an increase of forty or fifty catties. This was truly unexpected by the Control Committee when setting the price. With such poor quality, how can the price be increased?</p>
<p>Deqing, Chongde, Haining, and other counties have historically had silk reeling losses that were not very good, but this year they are even worse. Merchants, in order to preserve their capital, followed the pricing table set by the Control Committee and calculated the purchase price. How could they suppress the price? Yet the Control Committee is detaining all cocoons priced below twenty-one yuan, regardless of how many cents or jiao, even though there was no such method before, and there was no clear order given in advance. This is the first reason why exemption from detention should be requested. The price of silk is gradually decreasing. When the Control Committee set the cocoon price, it was based on a silk price of 665 taels. Now, however, the price of silk in overseas markets and among domestic users has fallen below 600 yuan for higher grades, and only 540 or 550 yuan for lower grades. The current silk price</p>
<p>is different from the silk price when the cocoon price was set</p>
<p>by more than one hundred yuan, or fifty or sixty yuan. Merchants, seeing this market situation, how can they not consider costs? Moreover, business is originally for profit, and it is not appropriate to save people from the well. The rise and fall of the silk price, and the size of the cocoon price, are dictated by the facts, and there is absolutely no intention to greedily seek cheap prices or hinder the interests of silk cocoon farmers. The Control Committee, being aware of the ways of the world, directly strikes down the silk cocoon merchants, which is indirectly striking down the rural areas. Why only consider the silk cocoon farmers and not at all consider the silk cocoon merchants? Being biased towards one side, how can it be reconciled? This is the second reason why exemption from detention should be requested. Silk cocoon farmers are eager to sell. Good quality cocoons, even if the price is increased, farmers are still unwilling to sell them easily. Only inferior cocoons are rejected by the silk cocoon merchants, and the farmers return again and again, even begging to be bought in order to sell their goods for cash, and some even asking others to intercede</p>
<p>and voluntarily lower the price.</p>
<p>Whether the cocoons are good or bad, silk cocoon merchants pay the same improvement fee and the same packaging and drying fees. Is it better to buy good cocoons or bad cocoons? Even though silk cocoon merchants have the power, they would never willingly buy bad cocoons. The fact that they do so is out of consideration for the livelihood of the silk cocoon farmers, and it is truly unavoidable, resulting in a price that does not meet the central price. This is precisely the hardship of the silk cocoon merchants, and not their black hearts. Being personally involved in the situation, one can understand it clearly. This is the third reason why exemption from detention should be requested. Based on the above three points, the Control Committee's severe actions truly disregard the difficulties of the merchants. Merchants who buy cocoons urgently need to transport them to Shanghai to pledge for funds to repay loans, urgently need to process them into silk to deliver futures contracts, and urgently want to reel and select</p>
<p>to maintain workers.</p>
<p>If sixty percent are not allowed to be shipped, and forty percent are still retained, silk cocoon merchants have no choice but to send people to watch over them, increasing expenses by one share, which increases costs by one share. In this time of sluggish market conditions, how can they bear this loss? The original Control Committee's talk of sample testing was nothing more than to clarify the truth and prevent price suppression. However, the extent of silk reeling loss this year is truly alarming. The silk reeling loss tested by various silk mills has reached as high as 670 or 680 catties on the Sima scale. The most common, such as Deqing, Chongde, Haining, and other silk producing areas, are generally around 600 catties. Compared to last year, the hidden loss has increased by more than 100 yuan, or 70 or 80 yuan, or 50 or 60 yuan per picul of silk. Taking one silk mill as an example, for 500 piculs of silk, it is necessary to increase the purchase of 500 piculs of cocoons. The value of these 500 piculs of</p>
<p>dry cocoons</p>
<p>is nearly 50,000 yuan. How can they sustain such hidden losses? Silk cocoon merchants have suffered disastrous losses for years, and the rural areas have gone bankrupt as a result. The government is already struggling to provide relief and maintenance, yet it uses pressure to bind the silk cocoon merchants, crushing them, as if fearing it is not enough, suddenly accusing them of price suppression. The silk cocoon merchants are left to await death with their hands tied. Is this truly the blessing of the country? Even if the sample testing clarifies the situation and avoids punishment, who will compensate the silk cocoon merchants for their losses? Our association is a silk cocoon industry organization, and we respectfully request that the Control Committee respect its own set cocoon price table, and grant passage first to all those priced above 19 yuan and 29 cents. For those below that price, then conduct sample testing to reduce the suffering of the silk cocoon merchants. We hope that your Excellency will impartially handle this matter. This is truly for the public good. Respectfully submitted to Huang, Chairman of Zhejiang Province.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Adds Qingdao-Putuo Regular Liners</h3>
<p>To Facilitate Summer Vacation Travelers</p>
<p>Equipped with Excellent Facilities</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to facilitate summer travel for passengers, has planned to add regular liners to Qingdao and Putuo. Yesterday, Mr. Chen Yuhua and Mr. Zeng Guangqing, the business director, agreed on the schedule for the two routes. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingdao Special Liner</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has not operated passenger liners between Shanghai and Qingdao for a long time. Now, due to the hot weather, the Qingdao municipal authorities welcome the company's four "New" class liners to operate special Shanghai-Qingdao liners to facilitate summer vacation passengers. This matter was discussed between Chen Yuhua and Section Chief Zeng. It was approved that the Haiyuan, Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen liners will be dispatched in rotation on the Shanghai-Qingdao route, departing from Shanghai every Wednesday morning at 9:00 AM. The Haiheng liner will depart on the 18th of this month. However, the Nanhua liner's three-six export schedule will continue as usual.</p>
<p>Putuo Combined Route</p>
<p>Every summer, the Shanghai-Putuo route is very crowded. The company has decided that the Shanghai-Ningbo liner, the Xinjiangtian, will depart from Shanghai to Ningbo and then to Putuo every Saturday, starting from July 4th. Passengers can stay for one day on Sunday, and the liner will depart from Ningbo on Monday, arriving in Shanghai on Tuesday. The Xinjiangtian has been improving all classes since its renovation, and its wireless radio has already taken first place on the Shanghai-Ningbo route.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Sightseeing Group from Surabaya Returned to Shanghai Yesterday from Hankou</h3>
<p>Part to Return to Surabaya the Day After Tomorrow, the Remainder Scheduled to Depart on the Second of Next Month</p>
<p>A group of sixty-six overseas Chinese from Surabaya, Java, led by Group Leader Pan Kaixing and Ke Shitian, after arriving in Shanghai last month, proceeded to tour Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, and other places. Having completed their tour, they returned to Shanghai yesterday at noon aboard the Taikoo &amp; Co.'s Longhe liner. According to Group Leader Pan Kaixing, this trip to various places has deeply impressed them with the beautiful scenery of the motherland, and everywhere expresses a spirit of greatness and solemnity. It is a pity that the time was too short to fully enjoy the gardens. They were warmly received everywhere they went, and they are deeply grateful. A portion of the group members, about thirty people, will depart on the 18th, led by Ke Shitian, aboard the Java Mail Line's Zibaide liner to return to Surabaya. The rest will stay in Shanghai to sightsee or attend to personal matters, and are scheduled to depart for Surabaya on the second of next month aboard the Zishadani.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Inspection Groups, One Arrived in Shanghai, One Went to Beijing</h3>
<p>One is a Confectionery Merchant Organization Inspecting Horticulture</p>
<p>One is a Student-Organized Inspection of Commerce</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News, Japanese inspection groups coming to China have been quite frequent in recent months. Previously, there were several Japanese inspection groups for wool, cotton, etc., that came to China. After arriving in Shanghai, they have already transferred to North China and other places. Recently, two more inspection groups came to Shanghai, one is the inspection group organized by the Tatehana Confectionery Co., Ltd., and the other is the Chinese Inspection Group organized by Tokyo students.

It is reported that they came to China to inspect confectionery technology and horticulture, and it is entirely a merchant organization without any other mission. After visiting the Wusong war zone and the Japanese Machinery Exposition the day before yesterday, they took a train to Suzhou and then to Beijing for inspection yesterday, and will come to Shanghai again on the 16th to visit Hangzhou, and have decided to return to China from Shanghai on the 18th.</p>
<p>Inspection of Commerce Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Twenty-five students from the Tokyo Commercial School, led by a professor from the school, organized a Chinese inspection group. Last month, they crossed from Japan to Shenyang, and after inspecting Beiping, Tianjin, Dalian, and other places, they arrived in Shanghai on the 12th from Qingdao aboard the Japanese Mail Line's Qingdao Maru. They could have arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but due to delays on the ship, they arrived in Shanghai at 11:00 AM yesterday. They are scheduled to inspect the city's education and commerce on the 16th, and visit the new Shanghai construction in the city center and the Wusong war zone. Then, that evening, they will go to Hangzhou for inspection, and return to Shanghai overnight, taking the Shanghai Maru, which leaves Shanghai on the 18th, to return to China.</p>
<h3>Sir Ross Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Sir Benzi Ross, after visiting Japan to confer with the Japanese authorities and exchange opinions, left Japan a few days ago aboard the Changxing &amp; Co.'s Empress of Japan liner to return to Shanghai, and is scheduled to arrive here at 9:30 AM today, berthing at the Gonghexing Wharf.</p>

Imai is scheduled to fly back to Beiping from Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Deployment of British and American Warships</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury states that the American warship Asheville, stationed in Shanghai, was ordered to sail to Hong Kong this morning (the 15th). If the political developments in Guangzhou endanger the lives and property of American citizens, it will enter the province immediately. Also, the American warship Salt Lake City, which is currently conducting target practice in the north, is also sailing from Yantai to Hong Kong. The only American warship currently docked in Guangzhou is the South China flagship Mindanao. The American warships on the Yangtze River docked in Hankou are the Luzon and Oahu. The Monocacy, originally docked in Hankou, has been ordered to sail to Changsha to join the British warships in that port. According to British naval officers in that port, no British warships have been specially deployed.</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, came to Shanghai by special night train at 11:00 PM the night before last due to important official matters in Shanghai. He arrived at the North Station at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning and returned to his official residence on Huangpu Road to rest. He will stay in Shanghai for about two or three days and then return to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Arrival Date of French Ambassador Naqi Ya in Shanghai</h3>
<p>End of June or Beginning of July</p>
<p>It has been reported that the newly appointed French Ambassador to China, Mr. Naqi Ya, will arrive in Shanghai on the 20th of this month to take office. However, on the morning of the 15th, according to the French Consulate General in Shanghai, it is still difficult to predict the date of Ambassador Naqi's arrival. Because Ambassador Naqi took a ship from Marseille on the 29th of last month to come to China, there were delays along the way. He is scheduled to arrive in Annam next week. He will land in Annam, visit the local authorities, and stay for four or five days. Then he will change ships to come to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the end of June or the beginning of July. The reporter has learned from diplomatic circles that after Ambassador Naqi arrives in Shanghai, he will go to North China to escape the summer heat. After our Chairman Lin returns to Beijing from Lushan, he will schedule a date to enter Beijing to meet and present his credentials.</p>

<h3>63rd Office Meeting of the Headquarters of the Aviation Association</h3>
<p>Fujian Fellow-Townsmen Association Donates Funds to Buy a Plane for Birthday Celebration</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the Shanghai City Rescue Team of the Chinese Aviation Association held its 63rd office meeting at the headquarters on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 14th) at 2:00 PM to discuss the fundraising plan. The attendees included General Secretary Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Lu Zhangyan, Gu Shangrui, Li Huiran, Song Zheng, Chen Tou, Zhou Nanjiao, Zhang Yimin, Huang Jun, Zhu Shengyang, Zhang Peihu, Li Jimin, Liu Songshou, etc. Chairman Li Dachao reported that the city's fundraising to buy a plane to present to the government as a memorial for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday has been enthusiastically supported by all walks of life. The students of the second training session in Suzhou initiated a fundraising campaign to buy a plane for his birthday, and have already raised 10,000 yuan for the purpose of buying a plane. It is stipulated that officials will raise 10,000 yuan, and each student will raise at least 10 yuan. Officials Zhao Guizhong and student representatives Jiang Longsheng and Lin Xuyuan were specially dispatched to Shanghai to contact the municipal government and the association to coordinate with the students who attended the training. They met yesterday to discuss the implementation plan, which will end at the end of the month, and are currently promoting it separately. Also, this afternoon, Mr. Huang Jinrong and the film industry in the city will be hosting a banquet at the Huang family garden to discuss promoting the movement to buy a plane for his birthday. The participation is extremely enthusiastic, and it was decided that each movie theater will hold a performance for one day, and all the ticket proceeds will be donated to buy a plane. They will also jointly host a fair organized by the city's film industry for one day, and Zhang Shichuan and others were appointed to prepare. The enthusiasm of Mr. Huang and the film industry is greatly appreciated. A few days ago, actors Ma Lianliang and Ms. Zhang Eyun gave a charity performance of famous plays at the Huangjin Grand Theatre. The audience was enthusiastic. The excellent results of Ma and Zhang and other famous actors are due to the enthusiastic invitation of Huang Jinrong and Du Yuesheng, which enabled the fundraising campaign to buy a plane to be completed as soon as possible. Letters have been sent separately to various groups and fundraising team leaders, who have successively submitted donations. The donations have been announced from time to time. The collection of aviation patriotic funds from various industries is proceeding smoothly and the results are very good. Then, various external affairs secretaries reported on the liaison and inspection. After discussing several fundraising plans, the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Fujian Association in Shanghai is actively working on fundraising to buy a plane for his birthday. It is jointly raising funds with the Quanzhou, SanShan, NanbeiJinjiang, and Anhai Guilds. The Association convened a meeting on the 4th Ma Road to discuss the matter, and decided to submit a result of 5,000 yuan for the purchase of a plane for his birthday. It is reported that the Quanzhou Guild delivered a donation of 1,000 yuan to the Airplane Purchase Memorial Committee yesterday, which was counted and a receipt was sent in thanks.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Letter Yesterday Asking the Flood Relief Association to Relieve the Shanxi Disaster</h3>
<p>The Shanxi Provincial Government suffered a severe bandit disaster this time, and the victims were displaced and had nowhere to go.

<h3>New Standards for Tea Inspection Implemented on July 1</h3>
<p>A Total of Four Points Approved by the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in order to promote the development of tea exports, has revised the export inspection standards for tea and decided to implement them starting from July 1st. These new standards for tea inspection and enforcement measures were decided at the Tea Standards Conference and approved by the Ministry of Industry, including the Inspection method for ash content, which has long been consistent between the Shanghai and Hankou bureaus. However, the moisture inspection, which used to use the weighing method, was difficult to adjust due to excessive oven use. As a result, the inspection results were inconsistent. Now, the simplified volumetric method of Hoffmann is used to ensure that the inspection results are consistent with each other. As for the standards for red and green tea, it was agreed to continue to use the same models as last year. In terms of moisture, the method was changed to the Hoffmann volumetric method. Compared with the old method, the actual difference is an average increase of 1.5 percent, so the numbers remain the same as last year and will not be changed. The measures to crack down on dyed tea are the same as last year. After several years of cracking down on dyed tea, the highest standard for dyeing tea has been reduced. This year, it has been decided to lower it again, and actively use yellow dye. If necessary, it is planned to cooperate with the local government to train a number of inspectors to go to various places to provide guidance. With regard to cracking down on substandard tea packaging, European and American tea merchants have repeatedly sent letters requesting attention. Chinese merchants also recognize the need for improvement. It has been decided to issue a notice to tea merchants that starting this year, they should add ten wooden strips to the existing tea boxes to ensure that the box shape does not change and is twice as strong.</p>
<h3>Chinese Inspection Group to Siam Telegraphs that it has Split into Groups for Inspection</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Leave Siam and Return to China in Early July</p>
<p>The Republic of China Inspection Group to Siam, led by Chief and Deputy Chiefs Ling Bing and Lin Kanghou, departed from Shanghai on the 26th of last month and arrived safely in Bangkok on the 6th. Recently, a friend of Deputy Chief Lin Kanghou received a telegram from Mr. Lin stating that since arriving in Bangkok, they have been welcomed by all sectors of Siam and have been very busy with social engagements. They have already split into groups to inspect commerce, economy, education, etc. They are scheduled to leave Siam and return to China in early July and are expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-July.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group to Depart Shanghai and Go Abroad in Batches</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group, sponsored by the China Industrial Overseas Trade Association, has more than 30 members. Since Gao Shiheng was elected as the group leader, many factories have enthusiastically requested to send goods for exhibition. The group was originally scheduled to take the Java Mail liner to Shanghai on July 3 to go abroad, but because the cabin space was insufficient, it was decided that a portion would leave first on the 3rd, and the rest would leave Shanghai on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Leader Li Zhuofang Visits Various National Goods Factories</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Zhuofang, a leader of overseas Chinese in the United States, has returned to the country to purchase domestic goods, and domestic goods manufacturers have expressed a warm welcome. Mr. Li recently went to Hangzhou to visit the special products exhibition of Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces, and was satisfied with the improvement and progress of Jiangxi porcelain, and purchased a large number of bamboo products. He was satisfied with the improvement and progress, and purchased a large number of bamboo products, which were loaded by the Hangzhou Tonghe Basket Shop and sent to Shanghai. After Mr. Li finished his official business, he has returned to Shanghai and is now preparing to set up an office at No. 20 Yingchunfang, Hubei Road, so that he can contact various manufacturers at any time. Yesterday, under the leadership of Mr. Chen Yiting of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, he visited the National Goods Exhibition Hall, the Huade Factory in Zhabei, the Sino-American Straw Mushroom Planting Field on Xitiyu Road in Jiangwan, and the Taixiang Porcelain Shop on Minguo Road. Mr. Li praised the light bulbs made by the Huade Factory, saying that the good raw materials, high luminosity, and energy saving are the three characteristics of domestic goods. The Sino-American Straw Mushroom Planting Field was first created by Mr. Li Jinting, a friend of Mr. Li, and is a unique new business in China. Mr. Li Jinting has extensive experience in researching straw mushroom planting methods at the Southern California Agricultural Science Research Center in the United States, and his business is developing rapidly. This is also a promising development for the agricultural prospects of our country. This time, Mr. Li purchased a large number of domestic products, some of which have been packed and sent to the United States. He will stay in Shanghai for about two weeks and then go south to Hong Kong and Guangdong to set up branches to purchase domestic products from the south. His spirit of advocating the use of domestic goods is admirable.</p>
<h3>Silver Syndicate Released 10.5 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>About to Hold a Meeting to Discuss Closing Matters</p>
<p>The Jiang-Zhe Spring Cocoon Season Loan Syndicate for the 25th year of the Republic (1936) has released a total of 10.05 million yuan in loans, with a term of three months each, as of yesterday. The loans were issued by the Shanghai General Office and the Wuxi and Hangzhou Branch Offices. Because Jiang-Zhe had a bumper crop of spring cocoons, the syndicate decided to accommodate silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants by increasing cocoon purchase loans. Now, it is decided that after the cocoon weighing has completely stopped in Jiang and Zhe provinces, and the Hangzhou and Wuxi branch offices have submitted the loan account books to the general office, the general meeting of the member banks will be held to discuss the closing matters. The participating banks, money shops, etc., recognizing that joint lending is beneficial to farmers and merchants, plan to continue to organize a syndicate for the autumn cocoon season.</p>
<h3>Post Office Provides its Own Postal Delivery Cars</h3>
<p>Petitioning Various Highway Authorities to Provide Convenience</p>
<p>Since the space for carrying mail on long-distance buses is limited, the Ministry of Communications has decided to order the post office to provide its own cars to transport mail exclusively, and has petitioned the Executive Yuan to instruct the relevant highway authorities to provide full convenience when driving. "The transportation of mail by long-distance buses should strictly comply with the Postal Regulations and the Regulations on Transportation of Mail by Long-Distance Buses stipulated by the Ministry, and on February 18th of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the relevant points to be observed by various provincial and municipal agencies, as well as public and private bus companies, for the transportation of mail were opened, and the 28th submission was submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved on February 23rd of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) with Instruction No. 594, stating, 'The submission has been noted and approved as requested in the submission. An order has been issued to various provincial and municipal governments to strictly comply with the instructions.' In order to improve the situation, it is necessary for the post office to, in addition to transportation by long-distance buses, consider the circumstances in various places and either provide its own cars or rent vehicles to transport mail exclusively on various highways, in order to expedite mail delivery. It is proposed to request the Executive Yuan to issue an order to various provincial and municipal governments, transferring it to various highway management agencies, to provide full convenience to the post office's own vehicles, or rented vehicles, that are exclusively transporting mail on the highway, and to inform the Chairman of the Military Commission of the Bashan Branch of the Kuomintang, as well as the National Economic Council, for review, in order to facilitate transportation. It is for the public benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications, acting as minister Yu Feipeng."</p>

<h3>High Court Dismissed Clerk Zhu Xiongwu and Others Accused of Fraud and Extortion</h3>
<p>Chen Chaozuan Granted Bail of 500 Yuan, Zhu Lu Remanded in Custody, Case to be Heard Again Next Monday</p>
<p>Zhu Xiongwu and Chen Chaozuan, dismissed clerks from the Jiangsu High Court, were previously discovered to have colluded with Lu Wenguang, who acted as a lawyer's clerk, to defraud litigants and extort money. The Wuxian District Court investigated and confirmed these facts, and filed a public prosecution. The Supreme Court ruled that the case should be transferred to the Shanghai First Special District Court for trial. Judge Huang Risheng previously conducted a preliminary hearing, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the court resumed the hearing. More than ten witnesses were summoned, but several failed to appear. Judge Huang first examined Lu Wenguang regarding the charges in the indictment, specifically the handling of Li Shannan's appeal. Witness Li Shannan testified that he was friends with Lu Wenguang. He stated that he had previously been sentenced to one year in prison and fined 1,000 yuan by the Shanghai District Court for fraud. Last April, he appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, and his wife asked Lu to draft the appeal. Lu predicted that the sentence could be reduced by six months, but the result was only the cancellation of the fine, while the prison sentence remained one year. Therefore, he later wrote to Lu, stating his inability to pay the promised reward of 200 yuan. When questioned, Lu Wenguang stated that the reduction of six months was merely a hope he expressed to Li's wife, not a guarantee. Next, Zhu Xiongwu was examined regarding the inquiry into the proceedings of the Chen Yuzhang inheritance case. According to Ma Runde, a clerk from the Jiangsu High Court, Shen, the judge, handled the case of the inheritance retrial for Chen Yuzhang, et al. Zhu Xiongwu inquired about the progress of the case with me in September of last year. I told him that they were currently being asked to pay the litigation fees. I did not notice whether Zhu looked through the case file at the time. When questioned, Zhu denied this entirely. Next, the Shanghai Yutai Firm and the Wuxi Zou Chengtai Rice Mill were questioned regarding Zhu Xiongwu's participation in the mediation of a debt dispute. According to Jiang Hongbin, a partner in the Yutai Firm, he invited Xu Hongchang and Ji Yunxiang to go to Wuxi to collect the debt owed by Zou Chengtai. On the evening of September 2nd last year, a settlement was reached between the two parties at Ji Yunxiang's home in Wuxi. Yang Shaoyun, the owner of the Xin Wuxi Newspaper, also participated. At that time, Zou Chengtai repaid 5,000 yuan of the debt. I took out 2,000 yuan and gave it to Xu Hongchang, instructing him to give it to Ji Yunqing and Yang Shaoyun as a reward for their efforts. Zhu Xiongwu was not present. When Judge Zhang of the Jiangsu High Court came to investigate on January 16th this year, I did not say that I was introduced to Zhu in Wuxi. As for the missing 7,000 yuan from the store's accounts, it was due to years of embezzlement by the manager, and not spent on other purposes. However, witnesses Ji Yunqing, and the Zou Chengtai factory owners, Zou Jikang, Fu Weisong, and Fan et al., all unanimously stated that Zhu Xiongwu was indeed present when the settlement was reached, reviewing all the documents for Jiang Hongbin. The Zou brothers stated that they did not initially know who Zhu was, but only knew that he had been invited by Jiang, and later learned that he was Secretary Zhu from the Jiangsu High Court. Zhu, however, claimed that the clothing described by Zou and Ji as what he was wearing on that day differed slightly, and therefore claimed that the witnesses' testimony was inconsistent, proving that he was not actually in Wuxi that day. The court, noting that Ji and Zou had no animosity towards Zhu, and were now all saying that Zhu was present at the reconciliation, repeatedly questioned Zhu. Zhu vehemently denied participating in the mediation. Ji Yunqing also stated that he had not received any monetary reward. Next, Zhu Xinfu's letter instructing Lu Wenguang to contact the parties involved was examined. The letter was found during a search of Lu's home, and the envelope was from the Jiangsu High Court. Lu previously stated that the letter was written as a joke by his nephew. Today, the seventeen-year-old child, Ru Yide, appeared in court and testified that he was studying in Suzhou and living at Lu's home. This letter was written when he was fifteen years old. The contents were merely a transcription of casual conversations he overheard at Lu's house from litigants, written as an exercise to practice letter writing. Furthermore, there was no such person as Zhu Xinfu. However, the words "awaiting reply" and the signature on the envelope were not written by me. Next, Miao Wenye and Cheng Jiu were examined regarding the public prosecution by the prosecutor in the Jiangsu High Court for offenses against national currency. Witnesses Miao and Ye both firmly stated that they did not know Zhu, and that there was no request for assistance or anything of the sort. Judge Huang then granted Chen Chaozuan bail of 500 yuan, remanded Zhu and Lu in custody, and rescheduled the hearing for next Monday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Liu Huizhi for Embezzlement of Bank Funds and Infringement of Shareholder Rights: Claiming 4 to 5 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhang Chongfu filed a confirmation lawsuit in the Civil Court.</p>
<p>He Jiechun and others submitted seven pieces of evidence of embezzlement.</p>
<p>—The Defendant was absent due to suffering from neurasthenia—</p>
<p>Liu Huizhi, the former chairman and manager of the China Industrial Bank and a native of Anhui, has been accused by shareholder Zhang Chongfu of embezzling public funds during his tenure, thereby infringing upon the rights of shareholders. Zhang filed a criminal complaint with the First Special Court. After deliberation, the court determined that Zhang's right to sue needed to be confirmed first in the Civil Court, and suspended the criminal trial. Zhang followed the instructions and filed a confirmation lawsuit in the Civil Court, which has now ruled in favor of confirming Zhang's right to sue.</p>
<p>Liu appealed this verdict to the Second Branch of the High Court, where the proceedings are ongoing. Now, another wave arises. Five more shareholders of the China Industrial Bank, He Jiechun, Weng Pengnian, Zhu Ruping, Yan Shu, and Yan Xiaoquan (holding a total of 640 shares worth 64,000 yuan), have discovered</p>
<p>evidence of Liu's embezzlement</p>
<p>in as many as seven instances, damaging bank funds by approximately 4 to 5 million yuan. The bank originally held shares in the Beiping Waterworks Company, with a face value of 200,500 yuan. These shares were purchased at a price of 165 yuan per thousand, for a total value of 33,825 yuan in national currency. On June 3, 1932, Liu unilaterally increased the purchase price of these shares by 245 yuan per thousand, increasing the cost by 50,225 yuan. On the same day, the increased amount was paid out of the bank under the guise of legitimate expenses, and simultaneously deposited into a "Gong Shun Ji" account opened by Liu under an assumed name. In one fell swoop, he</p>
<p>embezzled bank funds</p>
<p>of 50,225 yuan. On August 5, 1929, Liu falsely created a "Heng Ji" account in the savings department of the China Industrial Bank and deposited 30,000 yuan. On the same day, 29,500 yuan was withdrawn. Although there were subsequent deposits, the withdrawals always matched. Therefore, at the end of 1929, the account showed a balance of 500 yuan with an interest rate of six percent. By January 3, 1930, the account suddenly ballooned to a massive 360,013.80 yuan by January 18th. An investigation revealed that this money did not belong to Heng Ji at all. It was Liu who falsely created the Heng Ji account,</p>
<p>claiming to represent</p>
<p>the bank. The bank issued banknotes of 40,000 yuan per day, for a period of ten days. Liu deposited the banknote funds into the bank, achieving his purpose of private gain and embezzlement of profits. In total, he embezzled 23,666.14 yuan in interest. Liu purchased 1.569 mu of land on Avenue Edouard VII, intending to build a residence. Then, on May 25, 1931, Liu raised the price of the land to 112,000 taels and sold it to Heng Shun Company (which he had established). Heng Shun then transferred it to Daheng Company at the original price. Daheng then used this land, along with four other title deeds, to mortgage 224,140.23 taels to Heng Shun. Daheng then redeemed the land on Avenue Edouard VII with 70,000 taels. Ultimately, by using Heng Shun, he sold the land to the bank for 120,000 taels, offsetting the debt. His actions were nothing more than</p>
<p>creating a smokescreen</p>
<p>to achieve his purpose of damaging bank funds, causing the bank to lose 98,550 taels. Liu caused the bank to lose more than 42,000 taels with 2.188 mu of land on North Henan Road. He also caused the bank to lose 19,754.10 taels with 2.554 mu of land on Xin Zha Road. On January 7, 1932, due to the bank issuing too many banknotes, Liu feared inspection by the Ministry of Finance. He deposited 500,000 yuan of the bank's banknotes into a special deposit account under the name of Fa Ji, in order to reduce the amount of banknotes issued. Liu then took the opportunity to convert the deposit into a loan item on behalf of the Zhong Ji account,</p>
<p>collecting interest</p>
<p>at a monthly rate of seven percent, resulting in an annual interest payment of 42,000 yuan. The office in the French Concession had a "Zu Ji" account, used to store rent collected by Sun Yangnong on behalf of the bank for purchased properties. As of the end of June 1932, a total of 11,619.07 taels in rent had been received. After paying attorney Lu 50 taels, the whereabouts of the remaining 7,517 taels belonging to the head office are unknown. As manager, Liu cannot shirk his responsibility. After investigating these seven items, He et al. hired attorneys Chen Ying and Tang Yan to file a criminal complaint of embezzlement against Liu. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tan of the First Special Court opened the first criminal court for the hearing. Liu Huizhi was absent. His attorney appeared in court and stated that Liu was suffering from</p>
<p>neurasthenia</p>
<p>and was being treated at a sanatorium in Shanghai, and therefore could not attend the hearing. He requested that the hearing be postponed and asked for the case file of Zhang Chongfu to be retrieved. The plaintiff's attorneys, however, stated that they were now</p>
<p>adding Li Jizhi, the managing director of the China Industrial Bank, as a defendant. After Judge Tan reviewed the report, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled because the case file still needed to be retrieved.</p>
<h3>City Residents Should Be Careful About Their Diet: Gastroenteritis Cases Have Been Discovered</h3>
<p>Spring infectious diseases have disappeared. Era Hospitals are busily preparing.</p>
<p>The weather in this city suddenly turned hot and humid on the 13th, and the heat remains high today, fully expressing the summer climate. The situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Cases of Gastroenteritis Discovered</p>
<p>Since the start of summer in this port city, the weather has been cool, resulting in the continued presence of spring infectious diseases on the market. Since the sudden shift to hot weather beginning on the 13th, infectious diseases have begun to disappear over the past three days and have not been heard of. However, the number of people sleeping on the streets and those who greedily consume cold food has gradually increased, leading to the occurrence of summer epidemics such as gastroenteritis, especially among coolies. Therefore, people should be very careful about their diet to avoid suffering from illness.</p>
<p>Era Hospital Opens</p>
<p>This year is one of the most likely years for the outbreak of epidemics. Therefore, the establishment of epidemic hospitals is extremely important. Currently, in addition to the Shanghai Era Hospital on Xizang Road, which operates year-round, the Emergency Epidemic Hospital on North Xizang Road is also actively preparing to open as usual. The Chinese Epidemic Hospital on Huade Road in Hongkou opened yesterday at 2:00 PM, providing day and night consultation and accommodation, with 120 beds available.</p>
<h3>Xu Wancheng Detained, Various Civil and Criminal Cases Arise</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Zhao Examines Check Seal</p>
<p>Xu Open Undertakes Name of Principal Debtor</p>
<p>Xu Wancheng, the editor of the Longwen Bookstore at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Baiyang Lane outside the Great South Gate, was detained for publishing an advertisement in the Min Bao on June 3 that insulted the president of the Shanghai District Court and falsely accused Judge Zhao and others of accepting bribes, and court clerks of extorting money, etc., thereby obstructing official duties and committing libel. He was prosecuted and tried by the criminal court. Because Xu requested a transfer of jurisdiction, the trial was suspended pending a ruling by the Jiangsu High Court. Therefore, Xu Wancheng is now detained in cell number 30 on the second floor of the detention center, savoring the flavor of prison life. Unfortunately, good fortune never comes in pairs, and misfortune never comes singly. Xu Wancheng's fate is full of adversity. Yesterday, a criminal case occurred: issuing bad checks. The face value of the check was 200 yuan. Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia conducted an interrogation and investigation. The second case was the Shanghai Piano Company, He Chunsheng, suing Xu Wancheng for failing to return a mortgaged piano. Judge Chen Bingxin presided over the trial. In the afternoon, Xu Wancheng was brought in by court police. He was wearing a brown student uniform, white cloth shorts, barefoot, and yellow leather shoes, looking haggard and staggering. In the check case, Prosecutor Zhao proposed to prosecute based on the check seal of Xu Wancheng. In the civil court, Judge Chen opened a special court to hear the case. He Chunsheng, the manager of the Shanghai Piano Company, hired attorney Shan Yinghui to appear in court. He claimed that Xu guaranteed the Shanghai Hongli Jingwen Primary School's rental of a No. 3 youmu piano numbered 225 on January 3, 1935, stipulating a monthly rent of 11 yuan for a term of one year. However, in November of last year, a pawn ticket was sent, and the school had closed down and the person in charge had absconded. But the contract stipulated thirteen rental clauses, and the guarantor had the immediate responsibility to fulfill the obligations. He requested the court to order Xu Wancheng to return the piano price of 400 yuan, plus 77 yuan in rent. Xu Wancheng testified that he was 31 years old, from Jinshan, and currently detained. He said, "My guarantee is real, but I am only responsible for one year. Beyond one year, I am not responsible. I also have no money," and requested to write the name of the principal debtor and asked for investigation and subpoena, etc. The official attempted to reconcile the matter, ordering the piano to be redeemed from the pawn shop for the original 154 yuan, and the rent to be repaid separately. Xu refused, and the plaintiff's attorney said that the defendant was a director of the Jingwen Primary School. Xu Wancheng denied this. Because the reconciliation failed, the official concluded the debate and ordered Xu Wancheng to be returned to custody for sentencing tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Six Robbers Hold Guns, Rob Da Kang Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>No Cash in the Vault</p>
<p>The Robbers Got Nothing</p>
<h3>Dai Agen and Others Sentenced to Twelve Years for Manufacturing Red Pills for Profit</h3>
<p>Wang Ye Shi Acquitted and Released</p>
<p>Inspector Jiang Futian and detectives Wang Rusong and Zhang Daorong from the French Concession police station learned from Shen Jinshu and others that at 9:00 AM on May 25th, while inspecting pedestrians at the intersection of Min Ti Nei Yin Road and Avenue Aulnay, they spotted pedestrians Dai Agen (30 years old, from Ningbo, residing in the pavilion on the second floor of No. 9 Mai Sai Er Di Luo Road), Zhu Xisheng (42 years old, from Taizhou, residing at No. 692 Huining Road, Nanshi) and a woman Wang Ye Shi (36 years old, from the same hometown as Zhu and residing at the same address). Zhu was carrying a suitcase, and they looked suspicious. They approached and inspected the suitcase, finding 30,000 red pills inside, which were newly manufactured and still warm. Dai confessed that the manufacturing site was in a pavilion room on the ground floor of the Futai Wood Shop on Avenue Joffre. The detectives immediately rushed to the address, seized 1,500 red pills, 46 pounds of white powder, and a full set of manufacturing equipment and raw materials, and brought them back to the police station. They were sent to the Special Court for interrogation and investigation, as reported in this newspaper. After investigation by the police department, they were prosecuted according to the law. Judge Li Changnian opened a court for interrogation and concluded the trial. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, Judge Li appeared at the first criminal court, ordered the defendants to be brought to the court, and sentenced Dai Agen and Zhu Xisheng to twelve years in prison each, and deprived them of their civil rights for twelve years. The seized red pills and other items were confiscated and burned. Wang Ye Shi was acquitted. During the appeal period, the defendants were returned to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Adopted Daughter-in-Law: Zheng Qiu to be Detained and Sent to Court</h3>
<p>Yu Yuexiu Temporarily Returned to Biological Mother for Adoption</p>
<p>Yu Minquan (38 years old, from Ningbo, currently doing business outside), and his wife Yu Zheng, residing in Xiaomuzhiqiao, Xietu Road, in the Chinese Concession, have a daughter named Xiuyue, who is fourteen years old this year. On June 11th of last year, through relatives Zheng Ahong and Wang Zhoushi as matchmakers, she was betrothed to Zheng Chunli (24 years old this year, continuing his father's singing business, previously performing at the Xinguang Grand Theater, now taking gigs at home), the son of Zheng Yuekui (58 years old, engaged in opera singing), and Zheng Qiu (53 years old, usually a vegetarian who chants Buddhist scriptures), residing at No. 13 Qiaoan Lane, Avenue d'Aligre, in the French Concession. At that time, they received a bride price of 80 yuan. Xiuyue then entered the family as a child bride. Unexpectedly, her aunt Zheng Qiu, although usually a vegetarian who chants Buddhist scriptures, was of violent nature. Seeing that her adopted daughter-in-law was young and unable to handle adult work, she often abused her. She also disliked the girl for constantly gossiping in front of her neighbors, revealing family secrets. Therefore, she frequently whipped the girl with rattan sticks. The girl's cries of distress could be heard outside the house, several times a day. Recently, she has intensified her abuse. Neighbors, feeling sorry for the girl, secretly reported to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association, requesting investigation and rescue. After receiving the letter, the association sent staff member Zhao Jian to investigate and confirm the facts. The association reported to the French police on the previous day, and Western detective Chun Gusk and Chinese detective Xu Jinlong, together with Zhao Jian, rushed to arrest Zheng Qiu. They seized a thick rattan stick used for assault and brought the victim, Yu Xiuyue, to the police station. The girl was first sent to Guangci Hospital, where it was verified that her legs were covered in bruises and wounds. Yesterday, they were sent to the first criminal court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Li Changnian conducted the hearing. Police Department attorney Fei Xizhen explained the case, requesting an extension of the investigation and asking for prosecution. When the victim Yu Xiuyue testified about the abuse she had suffered, she cried incessantly. Judge Li reviewed the testimony and ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the morning of the 18th. The victim was ordered to go to the forensic doctor for examination and was temporarily returned to her biological mother, Yu Zheng, for adoption.</p>
<h3>Dinh Vệ Hưng Sentenced to Six Months in Prison for Seducing a Young Woman</h3>
<p>Dinh Vệ Hưng (24 years old, from Wuxi) opened a Wufeng vermicelli shop in the Wang Zhu establishment. On the evening of December 3rd of the previous year, at 11 p.m., he seduced Ji Fen, the 18-year-old daughter, and took her to a Suzhou hotel, where he locked her in a room and had sexual intercourse with her. After staying for a week, they went to Jiaxing, rented a house, and lived together like husband and wife for five months. She became pregnant. Last April, he sent the girl home and told her to reveal the situation to her mother. Wang Zhu was furious, saw her daughter's abdomen protruding, scolded her and drove her out. The girl regretted her actions and sought out Dinh again, and they temporarily rented a small house in the south city. In September, she gave birth to a child. Recently, they returned to his home in Wuxi, where she learned that her master had a wife. Unwilling to be a concubine, they disagreed and resented each other. Feeling resentful, she and Dinh came to Shanghai the day before and went to her house to beg her mother. Wang Zhu felt that Dinh should not have harmed her daughter to such an extent, ruining her lifelong happiness. She secretly reported to the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective Wang Renzhong to rush to arrest Dinh and bring him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the third criminal court of the First Special Court, where Labor Bureau attorney Zhang Shuaizhu filed a public prosecution for the crime of disrupting marriage and requested investigation. Wang Zhu proved the defendant's seduction process. The judge asked the young woman Ji Fen to state that she was weak-minded and deceived at the time, and that she did not want to follow him, etc. Dinh pleaded guilty, stating that the child was currently being raised at his home in Wuxi. Xiao Xiefen ruled to sentence Dinh to six months imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Police Check Pedestrians and Find Handgun in Rickshaw</h3>
<p>Wu Maotao and Others Arrested and Taken for Interrogation</p>
<p>Police officers Wang Tongjie and Zhong Yantong from the Liyuan Road police station of the Ximen branch, while checking pedestrians on Xieqiao yesterday at 5:00 AM, noticed a rickshaw with Municipal Chamber of Commerce registration number 8905 passing by, acting suspiciously. They stopped it and found a 6-inch Browning handgun, serial number 88245, and six bullets under the seat. They arrested the passenger and the rickshaw puller and took them to the station. The rickshaw puller identified himself as Wu Maotao, 24 years old, from Tongzhou, and claimed that Jiang Hongbiao had given him the gun and bullets to take to room 8 of the Xin Wanli Inn on Lanqui Avenue, Nanyang Bridge, in the French Concession. They then worked with French Concession police and Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Jiang, who confessed that the mastermind was Wang Ronggui, who was hiding at No. 16 Baoren Lane, Guohuo Road. They went to arrest him, but he had already fled. They only took his wife, Wang Gan, 20 years old, from Tongzhou, for questioning.</p>
<h3>Sixteen Shop Public Security Bureau Arrested Seven Thieves One After Another</h3>
<p>In front of the Xintai Xiang North Goods Store at No. 69 Yangjiadu Street in Nanshi, at 3:00 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, thieves broke open the front door and stole 170 yuan in legal tender, 11.99 yuan in small coins, seven silk clothes, tortoise shell glasses, a Parker pen, a silver cigarette case, etc. The victim reported the incident to the Sixteen Shop Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Team and requested an investigation. The two team leaders, Dong Mingde and Sun Jingyu, supervised the leaders Wu Songshan, detectives Xu Ziliang, Li Fatong, Wu Diansan, Zhao Renxin, Xu Yuanwen, etc., to investigate.</p>
<p>At about 4:00 AM yesterday, they learned that the thief Wang Chunlin and others were staying at No. 113 Danfeng Road. They immediately worked with the Yimiao police to arrest the gang leader Wang Chunlin (29 years old, from Zhenjiang), the harboring thief Liu Wang (36 years old, from Nanjing), and the suspect Ban Afu (24 years old, from Nanjing). In the room, they found the original tortoise shell glasses, a Parker pen, a silver cigarette case, a line of cotton robes, a cooked Roman shirt and pants, a bed sheet, a leather bag, three vases, a wooden frame, fourteen pawn tickets, three pieces of evidence, and an electric torch. They took them to the team headquarters for interrogation. Wang confessed that he was a habitual thief and admitted that he directed the gang to steal silver, clothes, and other items from the Xintai Xiang North Goods Store. He also stole 205 yuan in legal tender and clothes from Chen Achang's home at No. 20 Sunjialong a week ago. He stole self-ringing alarm clocks, vases, and bed sheets from Fang Zhonghe's home at No. 76 Taiping Lane.

<h3>Revenge Untaken, Calamity Strikes Again</h3>
<p>Jin Xingsheng and Others Detained and Brought to Court, Further Investigation Scheduled for This Friday</p>
<p>Jin Xingsheng from Shanghai and his party, who ran a laundry business, went to the Tianyun Lou amusement park at the Wing On Company on the 16th of last month. At the civilized play theater, a dispute arose with a tea server named A'gang over tea. Jin was immediately beaten severely by A'gang and others. Subsequently, A'gang's father and a female tea server from the Shaoxing opera theater at the amusement park, nicknamed Da A, intervened to mediate and offered Jin face. After the show, Da A accompanied Jin to Changsha Road, but unexpectedly, Da A gathered more people and severely beat Jin again. Feeling deeply resentful after these two beatings, Jin constantly sought revenge. Yesterday, he gathered Ma Jinhai from Tongzhou, Zhu Quanyuan from Haimen, Zhang Zhirong from Shaoxing, and Xu Zigao from Tongzhou, a total of four people, and went to Room 13 of the Hongxiang Inn, No. 20 Aivenyi Road, to discuss methods of revenge. They also brought three axes. However, the plan was discovered by Chinese detectives Wang Jiaju and Chen Shanji from the Old Zha gate Police Station, who, along with Western Detective Smith, arrested them at 9:55 PM the previous evening. Ma Jinhai was arrested inside the room, and the three axes were confiscated and taken back to the police station. Detectives remained on guard in the room. At 10:10 PM, Jin, Zhu, Zhang, and Xu arrived and were arrested together. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division 1. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation, stating that the case required further investigation and requesting detention. Detective Wang then submitted a report on the arrest. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the report and questioned the five suspects briefly, ordering their detention until this Friday for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Seduction and Abandonment</p>
<h3>Vice President of Zhongnan Bank, Yang Zhongfen, Accused</h3>
<p>Demanding 20,000 Yuan for Living and Educational Expenses, Defendant Absent, Hearing Rescheduled for Wednesday</p>
<p>Liu Huizhen, a 22-year-old woman from Suzhou residing at No. 58, Xin Xiude Lane, Baike Road, recently retained a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Yang Zhongfen, Vice President of Zhongnan Bank, of seduction and abandonment. The lawsuit included a civil claim, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay 10,000 yuan for living expenses and 10,000 yuan for the upbringing and education of their biological son, A'li. The court had already heard the case several times but had to reschedule each time due to the defendant's absence. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang held another session in the criminal court. The defendant still failed to appear. His defense lawyer stated that the defendant was scheduled to return to Shanghai from another port by ship today to surrender to the court and respond to the charges, but he had not yet arrived. It was presumed that the ship was delayed due to fog, so he requested another postponement. He presented an airmail letter written by the defendant as evidence. The plaintiff, Liu Huizhen, holding her son A'li, testified that she was sold by her mother to a brothel run by a foster mother named Chen A'liu (located at Xiaohuayuan, Sanma Road) at the age of seventeen and worked as a prostitute. The defendant, Yang Zhongfen, was a customer. After their relationship began, he claimed that his wife had passed away and expressed his desire to marry her. On December 10th of the 22nd year of the Republic, he forbade her from continuing to work as a prostitute and arranged a private elopement. They first resided at the Hongkou Grand Hotel. At that time, the defendant instructed her to hire lawyer Li Mingsen to send a letter to Chen A'liu to negotiate, but she did not file a lawsuit due to her conscience. Subsequently, they rented a place at Yongfeng Lane on North Sichuan Road, and later moved to No. 39, Sheng Dali, Shengmuyuan Road in the French Concession. For several years, all expenses were covered by the defendant. When she became pregnant two years ago, the defendant arranged for her to give birth at the Ke Mei Obstetrics Hospital. However, at the end of last year, she learned that the defendant already had a wife. After expressing some criticism, the defendant changed his attitude, cut off financial support, and stopped visiting. Therefore, she filed the lawsuit, requesting the court to order him to pay 20,000 yuan. Judge Jiang reviewed the testimony and ordered the case to be rescheduled for next Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Bathhouse Owner and Lawyer Accused of Joint Fraud</h3>
<p>Zhang Yubao, former owner of the Furun Chi bathhouse at the intersection of Ximen, Zhonghua Road, and Penglai Road, found it difficult to maintain operations due to poor business in April of this year. He entrusted lawyer Zhang Binqiu, residing at No. 21, Lafayette Road, French Concession, to act as his agent with full authority to clear accounts and solicit the transfer of the bathhouse. Subsequently, Wu Shicui, a local resident of Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, contacted lawyer Zhang to negotiate the transfer, with a price of 1,450 yuan, of which 900 yuan was for off-the-books costs and 590 yuan was for remuneration. Lawyer Zhang guaranteed that there would be no unexpected disputes. Both parties signed a contract and paid the transfer price. Suddenly, the landlord, Wang Caibao, opposed the transfer due to Furun Chi's unpaid rent. He appointed lawyer Wang Kanghou and filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court, which issued a preliminary injunction in May, sealing the Furun Chi bathhouse. Wu Shicui, having taken over the bathhouse, was unable to operate and lost the transfer price. He contacted lawyer Zhang and the former owner, Zhang Yubao, to negotiate, but to no avail. Wu then filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Zhang Yubao and lawyer Zhang Binqiu of fraud, requesting that they be investigated and prosecuted according to the law, and seeking the return of the paid transfer price. The court, based on the lawsuit, held a hearing and ordered a postponement. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held. The defendant, Zhang Binqiu, filed a countersuit accusing Wu of defamation and obstruction of reputation. The plaintiff, Wu, presented the case as described above. After questioning the two defendants, the court, believing the facts were clear, ordered closing arguments and announced that the verdict would be delivered at noon on the 22nd.</p>

<h3>He Shengrong Arrested for Peddling Fake Seasoning Powder</h3>
<p>He Shengrong, 37, from Changshu, had no steady job. Recently, he had a fanciful idea: he went to various used bottle shops to buy large quantities of used empty bottles of Weizong and Ajinomoto, filled them with starch powder, and covered the top with a little Ajinomoto and various other seasoning powders. He peddled them in various vegetable markets, asking one dime per bottle, but also accepting eleven copper coins. Many of the buyers in the vegetable markets were ignorant maids, and they were greedy for the cheap price and because the powder at the bottle opening tasted delicious, so countless people were deceived. Yesterday, the scam was discovered in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, and the local police arrested him, seizing the starch and 29 bottles of fake seasoning powder, and took him to the station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Experienced a Downpour Yesterday, Humidity Eased After the Rain</h3>

After 2:00 PM, the sunlight shone through, the sky cleared, and the easterly wind blew, easing the humidity somewhat.</p>
<h3>Merchants and Residents of Xujiahui Request Filling in the Li Zongjing River Channel</h3>
<p>The Li Zongjing River channel behind Xujiahui, west of Shanghai, connects to the Pu Zhao River in the south and reaches Fahua Town in the north. It has not been dredged since it was dredged in the 7th year of the Republic, and silt has accumulated. In recent years, residents along the river have dumped garbage into it daily, causing the current to stop flowing, the water to turn black as ink, and a foul odor to spread, making people nauseous. Now that summer has arrived, mosquitoes swarm, which is a significant health hazard. Various groups in Fahua Township have repeatedly petitioned the authorities to fill in the channel, but no action has been taken. Now, over two hundred merchants and residents of the Gelu area of Xujiahui have jointly petitioned the Municipal Government, requesting that the Public Works Bureau quickly fill in the river once and for all, both to revitalize the market and to sell the land for public benefit.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Slander Case: Ministry of Industry Urges Municipal Government to Investigate Thoroughly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation reported that Wang Xiaolai, a standing committee member of the federation and chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, was falsely accused by someone who fabricated the name of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, made up facts, distributed leaflets, and engaged in slander to confuse public opinion. The federation petitioned the Central Executive Committee, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry on the 30th of last month, requesting a thorough investigation in accordance with the law to rectify the situation. In addition to receiving a reply from the Public Training Department of the Central Executive Committee, the federation received a document from the Ministry of Industry, General No. 1526, which stated: "A petition dated May 30, 25th year, regarding the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce widely distributing leaflets slandering Wang Xiaolai, requesting a prompt and thorough investigation in accordance with the law. The petition has been noted, and the Shanghai Municipal Government has been consulted to investigate and handle the matter." This notice was issued.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau: Shareholder Registration Deadline</h3>
<p>The Donghui Meeting Scheduled for the 25th</p>
<p>The Bureau Has a Total of Nineteen Small Steamships</p>
<p>The China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau has suffered significant losses and heavy debts over the years. At the same time, due to the development of inland highways, passenger and cargo transportation has mostly shifted from water to land, making operations very difficult. The bureau has decided to convene a shareholders' meeting on the 25th of this month to discuss ways to improve the situation. The details have been reported in the newspapers. Here are the follow-up details:</p>
<p>Registration Deadline</p>
<p>Since the bureau published a notice to all shareholders holding shares to bring their shares to the China Merchants Bureau to register and receive admission tickets for the meeting, it is said that not many shareholders went to the bureau to register. The reason is probably that the Inland River Bureau was established a long time ago, and shareholders have transferred shares many times, and many have been lost. The shareholder registration period was scheduled to end at 5:00 PM yesterday and will not be extended. The shareholders' meeting will be held as scheduled on the 25th. According to sources, there is no hope for a turnaround in inland river operations, so the China Merchants authorities have decided to close it down. Most of the small inland river ships will be auctioned off to pay off debts.</p>
<p>Small Ship Names</p>
<p>It is known that the China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau used to have a total of twenty-one small ships on each line. Except for the Gonglong, which sank in the early years, and the Hengfeng, which was also dismantled due to its old hull, there are now only nineteen ships. Their names are as follows: Xiangfu, Lichuan, He'an, Jianyuan, Hekuan, Hengtong, Junfa, Liheng, Liyuan, Hengsheng, Hengji, Hengren, Feilong, Hejun, Taichang, Xinan, Ruishun, Lihang, Feiniao. In addition, there are sixteen tugboats and four cargo ships, totaling thirty-nine ships.</p>
<h3>Evaluation of the Achievements of the Vehicle Committee Two Years After its Establishment</h3>
<p>Improved Rickshaw Pullers' Lives and More Pleasant-Looking Vehicles</p>
<p>Lowered Vehicle Rental Fees Benefit Rickshaw Pullers and Do Not Harm Vehicle Owners</p>
<p>The Public Concession authorities, due to the need to improve the rickshaw situation in the city, organized a Special Rickshaw Committee in September 1933 to investigate and study various aspects of the rickshaw problem and propose improvement measures. By February of the following year, the committee had completed its investigation, prepared a report, and submitted it to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, along with sixteen recommendations. Subsequently, the Public Works Department convened a joint meeting of the Security and Transportation Committee to discuss the report and its various recommendations for improvement. As a result, the joint meeting advocated the establishment of a Rickshaw Affairs Committee and adopted thirteen of the improvement measures proposed by the Special Committee. The Public Works Department's Rickshaw Affairs Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Vehicle Committee) was established on May 23, 1934, and appointed Westerner Mr. Massey (former director of the Public Works Department) and Chinese Zhu Maocheng, Wang Zhiren, and Mr. Jun as members. It began operations immediately, implementing the improvement matters recommended by the Special Committee. Now, the Vehicle Committee has been established for two years, and all facilities have been announced and reported in Chinese and foreign newspapers. Recently, the Vehicle Committee prepared a report on the achievements of its work over the past two years and submitted it to the Board of Directors, comparing the improvement items originally approved by the Board of Directors with the extent to which the committee has achieved them. We have learned the content and selectively disclose it, which should be welcomed by those who are concerned about social issues.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 4, "The existing 10,000 public rickshaw licenses will not be reduced for the time being. However, the Rickshaw Affairs Committee may at any time present articles to the Board of Directors to gradually reduce the number of rickshaw licenses," has been contributed by the Vehicle Committee to the Special Rickshaw Committee and is still under consideration by the Special Committee.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 5, "The vehicle owner registration book, as recently compiled, should be put into effect as soon as possible," has now been satisfactorily completed.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 6, "Implement regulations on vehicle rental fees, register rickshaw pullers, and improve vehicles so that rickshaw pullers can increase their income and improve their living conditions," now the vehicle rental fee has been set and magnetic plates have been nailed next to the vehicles, specifying the amount of the fare. However, when rickshaw pullers and passengers negotiate their own prices, it is difficult to make both parties abide by the official fare. Furthermore, rickshaw pullers are now generally registered and vehicles are gradually being improved, and the establishment of rickshaw puller mutual aid societies can be said to have achieved considerable results in the eyes of the Vehicle Committee. The benefits that mutual aid societies can now offer to rickshaw pullers include: children's schools, outdoor and indoor clinics, injury and sickness relief, insurance, funeral expenses, public cemeteries, bathing facilities, dormitories, canteens, and tea rooms. Roughly calculated, if a rickshaw puller's physical strength has not declined, then what he earns now is one dollar and seventy cents to two dollars and forty cents more per month than two years ago, and the various benefits provided by the mutual aid society are not included.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 7, "Public and private rickshaw pullers should be registered and licensed immediately," the registration and licensing of public and private rickshaw pullers has now been satisfactorily completed, and rickshaw pullers have recently been re-registered to meet the needs of the rickshaw industry.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 8, "The public rickshaw rental fee should be calculated at eight dimes for a full 24 hours, or pro-rated based on the length of time. The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department may modify these rental fees at any time." The vehicle rental fee has now been reduced to seven dimes and seven cents per day (including seven cents for mutual aid society fees). This rent reduction benefits rickshaw pullers and does not increase the suffering of vehicle owners.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 9, "Specify vehicle rental fees based on the distance of the road and the length of time, and list them in a conspicuous place on the vehicle," has now been achieved. This price list is calculated in dimes, but the Vehicle Committee is not currently advocating changing the new table.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 10, "Public rickshaw vehicles should be improved immediately," now there are a total of 1,765 new-style vehicles on the market. According to the Vehicle Committee, these new-style vehicles are far superior to the old-style vehicles in terms of comfort and weather protection. According to a survey from the rickshaw pullers' side, the new-style vehicles are stable and convenient to drive.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 11, "Vehicle inspections should be stricter than before," much has already been done, and there is still much to be done. This depends on the efforts of the staff.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 13, "Establish rickshaw stations in convenient locations everywhere," there are now 91 rickshaw parking places within the Public Concession, most of which have been established in the last two years.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 14, "The rickshaw registration method should be improved," has now been achieved. It is now planned to formulate a method that allows the Public Works Department to revoke the licenses of rickshaw pullers who do not perform their duties on time, so as to avoid unqualified individuals.</p>
<p>The original recommendation No. 15, "Continue to crack down on 'wild' chartered vehicles," this is being actively cracked down on.</p>

<h3>Women's Discus World Record</h3>

<h3>Our Country's World Games Football Team European Travel Notes Written and Sent by Li Huitang</h3>
<p>On May 26th, after our narrow victory over the Malang players, because the weather was cool and the scenery was pleasant, "Autumn enters the heat at twelve o'clock", which is most suitable for recuperation, we decided to stay for two days. Our team's decision to go on a long expedition and fight hard for days, now let's do a general review of the injured. Huang Jiliang, Li Guowei, and Chen Zhenhe injured their ankles, Huang Meiyu and Zheng Jiliang injured their knees, the reporter injured his shoulder, and there were many minor injuries. Fortunately, in this area with water and soil not suitable for everyone, no one has contracted a disease, which can be regarded as the blessing of Heaven. On the 28th, we returned to Surabaya by special car. There was nothing to say overnight. On the 29th at noon, we took the train to Yishi Long. When we arrived at the station, all the houses were lit up. The whole team moved into the China Hotel. On the 30th, early in the morning, Huitang and Director Rong went to the airport to meet Manager Huang Jiajun, because he had to stay in Surabaya to settle accounts, so he took a plane early this morning. At 10 o'clock, we were jointly welcomed by the local Kuomintang branch, the General Chamber of Commerce, and various overseas Chinese organizations, who presented flags and gave instructions, just like the earnest expectations of overseas Chinese in other cities. Finally, the reporter and Dr. Rong gave speeches one after another. The tea party was photographed, and then the meeting was dismissed. At 5 o'clock in the afternoon, we competed with the Long Selection Team. The opponent's strength was weak and could not withstand a single blow. As a result, our team was able to do whatever it wanted and wantonly destroy them with a score of 9-0, making the opponent unable to fight back. The fans were happy to go home. Our team used a new formation to respond in this battle as follows: three to zero in the first half, and nine to zero in the end. The goalscorers were Jingxiang 3, Jinshun and Jiangbai 2 each, and Beihua and Guicheng 1 each. The acting captain, Bao Jiaping, felt plain and not nervous. The football level of Longchuan is the weakest among the major ports in Java. Its basic selection team also sent teachers to Surabaya to participate in the All-Java Football Port Championship. Those who faced us today were even worse. However, in the first 25 minutes of the first half, they were able to resist tenaciously. Their spirit of hard work is admirable. The lineup of our team changed greatly on this day, because most of the central defenders were injured. Wenli and Xianyuan were originally central defenders, and today they were used to fill the vacancy. They were also familiar with the job and performed well. However, the opponent's strength was too weak and it was difficult to make a true test. Our countermeasures on the stage were improper, and we failed to attack repeatedly. It was not until 25 minutes later that we opened the record. In the second half, the opposing team was too tired and their exhausted expressions were fully revealed, and it became our team's world. The fish and meat on the chopping board were slaughtered at will. The game ended with a score of 9-0. If the breakthrough in the first half had not been too late, I am afraid that the number of losses on the other side would have been more than this. The mayor presented the trophy and dispersed after three cheers.</p>

<p>Children's Performance - More than 100 children participated in the children's painting performance, especially those who came to Shanghai from afar such as Chahar, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and Hankou. They took turns writing on the spot for guests, which greatly increased the interest of the audience. It is a pity that although so many people signed up, many did not participate in the performance temporarily, which is regrettable. All the performance works were also judged separately by the judging committee, and those with excellent results were given prizes and requested the National Children's Year Implementation Committee to commend them.</p>
<p>Good Spirit - The preparations for this conference took a long time, but because the works from various places could not be delivered on the scheduled date, the works delivered before and after the opening were crowded and the work of each team was tense. Fortunately, with the help of all parties, it was still able to cope. The situation at the venue was good during the ten days of the conference, and the spirit of the service staff was commendable. The association expresses its deep gratitude to the students of the American Academy of Fine Arts who wrote the catalog films and the Boy Scouts of various schools who maintained order at the venue.</p>
<p>Many Products - A total of 26 provinces and eight cities participated in the exhibition, which has been widely spread throughout the country. The number totaled more than 36,000 pieces. Although not very many, it was less enthusiastic because it was held for the first time. More than 9,000 pieces of the products were selected, and there were few discoveries of counterfeit imitations, etc. in the various products, and there were many original works. The purpose of the association's holding can be said to be fully achieved.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Education Department Implements Subsidy Measures for Free Education</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondence) The Guangdong Education Department has been promoting free education in recent years, and progress has been rapid. There are two sources of funding: one is to request subsidies from the provincial and central treasuries, and the other is to stipulate that counties and cities raise their own funds locally. For those who apply for subsidies to establish schools, the salaries of vocational teachers are fully allocated by the central government or the province. Counties and cities are only responsible for planning establishment fees and office expenses. Those who establish schools through their own fundraising are responsible for the salaries of vocational teachers, establishment fees, and office expenses. The Education Department now considers that the previous subsidy method was of a promotional nature, while the principle of promoting free education is to encourage counties and cities to organize it themselves, establish more primary schools, and broaden enrollment. Therefore, starting from the 25th year of the Republic (1936), new subsidy methods will be promulgated, and the original Provisional Measures for Implementing Free Education will be specially revised. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Subsidized primary schools before the 24th year of the Republic (1935) will continue to be handled as before. Starting from the 25th year of the Republic (1936), subsidies will be provided based on the economic situation of each county and city, classified into different grades. 1. First-class counties: Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, Shunde, Zhongshan, Xinhui, Chao'an, Chaoyang, Jieyang, Gaoyao, Taishan, Qujiang, Qiongshan, Maoming, Yangjiang, Qingyuan, Huiyang, Hepu, and other counties, as well as Shantou City, will receive an annual subsidy of 25% of the total cost of newly established county and municipal short-term primary schools. Counties and cities will raise 75% themselves. 2. Second-class counties: Meixian, Kaiping, Wenchang, Xingning, Chenghai, Haikang, Luoding, Xinyi, Lufeng, Haifeng, Yingde, Lianjiang, Boluo, Guangning, Raoping, Heyuan, Yangchun, Huaxian, Zengcheng, Puning, Nanxiong, Dianbai, Wuhua, Yunfu, Sanshui, Qinxian, Fangcheng, Lingshan, and other counties, as well as Meilu City, will receive an annual subsidy of 50% of the total cost of newly established county and municipal short-term primary schools. Counties and cities will raise 50% themselves. 3. Third-class counties: Heshan, Pu, Enping, Conghua, Lechang, Lianxian, Jiaoling, Sihui, Xinxing, Ding'an, Chengmai, Suixi, Huilai, Danxian, Deqing, Longchuan, Yunan, Zijin, Yaxian, Wanning, Huaxian, Shixing, Lingao, Pingyuan, Wuchuan, Longmen, Changming, Renhua, Fengshun, Heping, Bao'an, Wengyuan, Lianping, Fogang, Xinfeng, Xuwen, Lingshui, Fengchuan, Lianshan, Yangshan, and other counties will receive an annual subsidy of 75% of the total cost of newly established county short-term primary schools. Counties will raise 25% themselves. 4. Special third-class counties: Qiongdong, Chixi, Gan'en, Changjiang, Lehui, Kaijian, Ruyuan, Nan'ao　counties will receive an annual subsidy of 90% of the total cost of newly established short-term primary schools. Counties will raise 10% themselves. The subsidy funds for Baoting, Ledong, Baisha, and three other counties, as well as the Nanshan Administration and the Yunyao Bureau, will be handled separately. After the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the county governments may, based on the local economic situation, request the Education Department to approve changes to the distribution of subsidies for newly established short-term primary schools in each county and city. The teachers and staff of the primary schools shall also be selected and appointed by the county and city governments themselves, but they must submit their resumes to the Education Department for approval.</p>

<h3>Children's Education and the National Salvation Movement (2)</h3>
<p>A Speech by Municipal Education Director Pan Gongzhan on the Central Radio Station</p>
<p>If we can truly follow this educational purpose and achieve the goal of "enriching people's lives, supporting social survival, developing national livelihoods, and continuing people's lives," so that the nation can truly be independent, civil rights can truly be universal, and people's livelihoods can truly be developed, then education will have done its utmost in saving the nation. Originally, the Premier said, "The Three Principles of the People are the doctrine of national salvation." A doctrine can only be based on one. Since we are now using the sole Three Principles of the People to save the nation, build the nation, and govern the nation, education cannot jump outside the scope of the nation and, of course, can only be based on this sole Three Principles of the People and cannot be compatible with other doctrines. It can be seen that the education of the Three Principles of the People is indeed national salvation education and the only national salvation education. Why do we need to come up with new tricks?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the goals of primary school education, the overall goal of our Chinese primary school education is: "Primary schools should, based on the Three Principles of the People, and in accordance with the educational purpose and implementation policies of the Republic of China, develop children's physical and mental health, cultivate the foundation of national morality, and the basic knowledge and skills necessary for life, to cultivate citizens who know propriety, righteousness, love the country, and love the people." Further analysis of this overall goal is to "cultivate children's healthy physique, cultivate children's good character, develop children's aesthetic interests, enhance children's life knowledge and skills, train children's labor habits, inspire children's scientific thinking, cultivate children's spirit of mutual assistance and unity, and cultivate children's concept of loving the country and loving the community." Such educational goals are originally very relevant to the needs of today's national crisis environment. If we can truly follow these goals and achieve everything stipulated in those goals, so that today's children will become healthy citizens in the future, we will have already done the duty of education. Why do we need to come up with new tricks?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the goals of primary school citizenship training, the goal of our Chinese primary school citizenship training is to promote the inherent morality of the Chinese nation, with loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace as the center, and to adopt the virtues of other nations. Analyzed, it is to "cultivate habits of cleanliness and hygiene, a happy and lively spirit, concepts of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, the virtue of fraternal sincerity, habits of thrift and labor, knowledge and skills of production and cooperation, concepts of public service and law-abiding, and thoughts of loving the country and loving the community." There is no doubt that such training goals are very relevant to the needs of today's national crisis environment. If we can truly follow this goal and achieve everything stipulated in that goal, so that today's children will become healthy citizens in the future, wouldn't we have done the duty of education? Originally, the Premier also said, "If we want to restore the status of the nation, in addition to everyone uniting to form a national group, we must restore the inherent morality. With inherent morality, then the inherent national status can be restored." Then, the goal of citizenship training that promotes the inherent morality of the nation and also adopts the virtues of other nations is, of course, the training goal of restoring national status. The so-called restoration of national status is to revive the nation, so that it can permanently exist independently in the world.</p>
<p>Based on everything mentioned above, we deeply feel that the purpose of Chinese education, whether viewed from the perspective of its purpose, goals, or any other aspect, is originally to seek national survival. Those who implement education, if they can truly and practically follow the purpose and goals, will naturally be able to achieve the goal of reviving the nation. Therefore, I personally believe that the more severe the national crisis, the more primary school educators should work hard. What they should work hard on is not to come up with new tricks, but to truly and practically follow the originally established educational purpose and goals and produce some practical effects.

<h3>A Brief Introduction to Military Poison Gas</h3>
<p>— Yao Xing-shu</p>
<p>The use of poison gas in warfare to deprive the enemy of combat and defensive capabilities has a long history. However, its concrete application began during the European War in 1914, when Germany pioneered its use. The average person harbors great fear of military poison gas. While we should not underestimate military poison gas, we must also break the blind fear, so that we can remain calm in an emergency, avoid panic, and calmly devise appropriate defensive plans to avoid most of the damage.</p>
<p>The name "military poison gas" is, in reality, somewhat inappropriate. Except for a few substances, not all of the materials used are gases. Some are liquids or solids with high boiling points, which are stored in bursting shells. When the shells explode, they turn into mist or dust and spread. Therefore, it is more reasonable to rename it as "chemical military supplies."</p>
<p>The purpose of using poison gas in wartime is, of course, to injure the enemy's body upon contact, depriving them of combat power and forcing them to withdraw from their guarded territory. The parts of the body that are harmed are nothing more than the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and throat, the lungs, and the skin.</p>
<p>Not all chemically toxic substances can be used as military poison gas. For example, carbon monoxide (the cause of coal briquette poisoning in winter), which is known for its severe toxicity, and hydrocyanic acid are not used militarily. To be used militarily, a substance must possess several physical and chemical properties.</p>
<p>I will now provide a general explanation of several important poison gases:</p>
<p>(1) Phosgene: Phosgene is the only toxic substance that is a gas at normal temperatures. It is colorless, has a distinctive odor, and cannot be stored for long in moist air. It is the most toxic and specifically attacks the lungs. It can easily cause death. When the air contains 45 milligrams of phosgene per cubic meter, it can be life-threatening. If 3.5 milligrams of this substance is inhaled within one second, death will occur immediately. Ordinary gas masks can protect against its attack because they contain reagents that absorb the substance. Spraying lime water can also quickly destroy it. This substance decomposes when affected by moisture (i.e., water) in the air, and its toxicity disappears.</p>
<p>(2) Diphosgene: Diphosgene is a colorless liquid at normal temperatures. When the pure product is heated to 120 degrees Celsius, it decomposes into phosgene. Its toxicity is equivalent to that of phosgene. It is stable and difficult to volatilize. It can remain on the ground for several hours without dissipating or changing. It has the same effect on the respiratory system as phosgene and is also a tear gas. Ordinary gas masks can prevent its attack. Spraying with lime water or calcium carbonate solution can completely destroy it.</p>
<p>(3) Chloropicrin: Chloropicrin is synthesized from bleaching powder and picric acid. It is a colorless, oily liquid that is insoluble in water and has a boiling point of 112 degrees Celsius. It is known as "vomiting gas" in the military. It is stable and can remain on the ground for a long time. Its vapor has a strong corrosive effect on the cornea and the mucous membranes of the nose and throat. When the air contains 19 milligrams of this substance per cubic meter, it causes tearing. At 60 milligrams, people cannot tolerate it, become dizzy, and vomit. Inhaling 16 milligrams within one minute will lead to immediate death. Its effectiveness is remarkable, and it is widely used. Spraying with liver of sulfur and soap solution can completely destroy it. It is quickly absorbed by activated carbon, so gas masks equipped with activated carbon can prevent its attack.</p>
<p>(4) Tear Gas (Chloracetophenone): Tear gas is a colorless crystalline solid that is insoluble in water and stable in nature. It dissolves in organic solvents and has an irritating effect on the eyes, causing tearing. However, recovery can occur after several minutes of inhaling fresh air. It is commonly used by the American police. Tightly fitting goggles can defend against it.</p>
<p>(5) Mustard Gas (Senfgas): This substance has a mustard-like odor, hence the name. It was widely used during the last European War. The pure product is a colorless liquid that is difficult to dissolve in water and can remain on the ground for several days. In winter, it can remain unchanged for months. It is a highly potent cellular toxin with great danger. When it is present in the air, people cannot detect it and do not experience noticeable pain. However, by the time the harm is detected, it is too late to provide aid. Extremely small amounts of mustard gas can cause obvious redness on the skin, gradually forming blisters, similar to burns. The speed and ease of recovery depend on the amount of toxin absorbed. It can also harm the lungs. Inhaling 12 milligrams within one minute can cause death. Gas masks are used to defend the respiratory organs. The rest of the body needs to be covered with clean and newly made rubber suits. Bleaching powder can destroy this substance. In cases of suspected mustard gas poisoning, bleaching powder solution can be used to wash the affected areas. Bleaching powder can be scattered on the ground or sprayed with its solution in areas full of mustard gas.</p>
<p>(6) Lewisite (Chlorovinylarsine): This substance has a scent similar to geraniums, also known as "death dew." It is a slightly yellow liquid that is difficult to dissolve in water but easily dissolves in organic solutions. It can cause blistering on the epidermis, like mustard gas. This substance was developed after the European War. The exact toxicity is unknown, but its irritating odor indicates its presence. It is also easily destroyed by alkaline solutions, cannot pass through gas filter kits, and its toxicity disappears upon contact with bleaching powder. Therefore, the effectiveness of its practical application remains to be proven.</p>
<p>(7) Diphenylarsine Chloride (Clark I): Diphenylarsine chloride is a solid with a high boiling point. It turns into a very fine mist when a gas shell explodes and flies around. It has a strong irritating effect on the nose, throat, and eyes. An concentration of 1 milligram per cubic meter of air is unbearable. This mist can penetrate ordinary respiratory filter kits, forcing the enemy to remove their gas masks. Taking this opportunity, a lung poison gas can be used to cause death. Adding a mist filter to the filter kit can defend against it. This substance decomposes and is destroyed upon contact with water.</p>
<p>(8) Diphenylarsine Cyanide (Clark II): Diphenylarsine Cyanide, readily degraded by water, led to the invention of this substance. It is also a solid, extremely difficult to dissolve in water, and durable. When the gas shell explodes, it turns into a fine mist that is a strong irritant to the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and throat. A concentration of 0.005 milligrams per cubic meter of air causes tearing, and at 0.25 milligrams, it is unbearable. This substance cannot penetrate mist filter kits.</p>
<p>In summary, of the military poison gases, phosgene, mustard gas, and Diphenylarsine cyanide are the three with intense danger. During the European War, a great number of different poison gases were used. It has been seventeen years since the end of the Great War, and who knows how many new inventions have been made. National defense chemistry is a closely guarded secret in every country, and we have no way of knowing the details. However, a method of protection can always be devised for each type of poison gas. Modern people cannot create a toxic substance that is absolutely impossible to defend against. Moreover, no matter what kind of poison gas it is, it is not easy to use it to kill all the residents of an entire city or town, because open space, wind, and rain are all natural defenses. However, in local warfare and the capture of fortresses, poison gas is indeed a threatening weapon.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Child Mortality in Qimei Road Civilian Village, Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Li Caihua</p>
<p>This is the result of a survey of 276 women in this village. To understand the number of child deaths, it is necessary to first describe the actual number of children born and the number of children currently living. Among the 276 women, two or three have never given birth. Some have been married for one to thirty years, and when asked why, they all answered with "I don't know." The 253 women who have given birth have collectively borne 994 children. Among them, 36 women gave birth to one child, accounting for 14.23%. Fifty-three women gave birth to two children, accounting for 20.95%. Forty-four women gave birth to three children, accounting for 17.39%. Twenty-seven women gave birth to four children, accounting for 10.67%. Thirty-five women gave birth to five children, accounting for 13.83%. Seventeen women gave birth to six children, accounting for 6.72%. Seventeen women gave birth to seven children, accounting for 6.72%. Twelve women gave birth to eight children, accounting for 4.74%. Five women gave birth to nine children, accounting for 1.98%. Four women gave birth to ten children, accounting for 1.58%. One woman gave birth to eleven children, accounting for 0.79%. Two women gave birth to twelve children, accounting for 0.79%. Women who gave birth to two children are the most numerous, while women who gave birth to eleven children are the least. On average, each woman gave birth to 3.53 children.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>The 253 women currently have 617 children, among which eleven women have no children. Women with one child are the most numerous, accounting for 28.09%. Followed by women with two children, accounting for 27.69%. Women with eight children are the least, accounting for 0.83%. The 242 women have an average of 2.54 children each. The 617 children account for 62.1% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Out of the 994 children, a total of 377 died, accounting for 37.9% of the total number of children born. In terms of gender, the results are quite unexpected. We usually think that the concept of valuing boys over girls is firmly ingrained in the minds of the public, and that there must be more girls than boys who died. In reality, we only need to look at the age and cause of death statistics to understand. According to the author's survey, the gender distribution of child deaths is as follows: 200 males, accounting for 53.05%. This accounts for 20.12% of the total number of children born. 177 females, accounting for 46.95%. This accounts for 17.78% of the total number of children born. The percentage difference between males and females is 6.1%.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>As for the age at the time of child mortality, for clarity, it is listed in the table below:</p>
<p>Distribution of the common age of death of children of 253 women</p>
<p>In the table above, the group aged one to three years old has the highest number of deaths, followed by the group under half a month old, and the group aged thirteen to sixteen years old has the lowest number of deaths.</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the causes of child mortality:</p>
<p>Sixty-two cases of tetanus, accounting for 16.45%. This accounts for 6.24% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Sixty-seven cases of measles, accounting for 17.77%. This accounts for 6.74% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Seventy-nine cases of meningitis, accounting for 20.95%. This accounts for 7.95% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Thirteen cases of diphtheria, accounting for 3.45%. This accounts for 1.31% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Thirty cases of smallpox, accounting for 7.96%. This accounts for 3.01% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Twenty-one cases of dysentery, accounting for 5.57%. This accounts for 2.11% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Ten cases of pneumonia, accounting for 2.65</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>. This accounts for 1.01% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Twelve cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 3.18%. This accounts for 1.21% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Thirty-three cases of typhoid fever, accounting for 8.73%. This accounts for 3.32% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Three cases of scarlet fever, accounting for 0.79%. This accounts for 0.30% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Three cases of whooping cough, accounting for 0.79%. This accounts for 0.30% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Five cases of cholera, accounting for 1.33%. This accounts for 0.50% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>One case of appendicitis, accounting for 0.27%. This accounts for 0.11% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Eight cases of cerebral congestion, accounting for 2.12%. This accounts for 0.80% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Eight cases of pyemia, accounting for 2.12%. This accounts for 0.0%.</p>
<p>Four cases of bloating, accounting for 1.10%. This accounts for 0.40% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Nine cases of malnutrition, accounting for 2.38%. This accounts for 0.91% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>Nine cases of accidental death, accounting for 2.38%. This accounts for 0.91% of the total number of children born.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>The above mortality figures are shocking, both in terms of age and cause of death. The most deaths are due to meningitis, followed by measles, then tetanus, and the least are due to appendicitis. In terms of age, as shown in the table above, the most are between one and three years old, followed by those under half a month old, and the fewest are between thirteen and sixteen years old. We know that the deaths under half a month old are all due to tetanus, and tetanus is the root of the problem caused by midwives. Midwives need to be trained, and this is imperative. As for midwives, the author surveyed 253 women who gave birth in this village, and it may be useful to tell the readers about this: 208 of the 253 women were delivered by midwives, accounting for 82.21%. Thirty-nine were delivered by Western doctors, accounting for 15.42%. Six were delivered by themselves, accounting for 2.37%.</p>
<p>Measles is originally a very easy-to-treat childhood disease and does not pose any danger. It can be dealt with as long as women have basic hygiene knowledge. However, the number of deaths due to measles accounts for the second largest number, which is shuddering to see. The immaturity of China's health education is very clear here.</p>
<p>The nine deaths due to poor nutrition, only one of them, due to the mother's illness and no milk to feed; the rest are because their mothers work all day and all night for livelihood, have no time to nurture, and starve their children to death alive. Labor crèches, labor crèches, please set them up universally! This is not only a medical problem, but also requires a great improvement in the entire society!</p>
<h3>Medicinal Plants of Domestic Origin (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Plantaginaceae</p>
<p>Plantain, *Plantago major* L. var. *asiatica* D.C.</p>
<p>(Plant) It grows wild in the mountains and fields and is a perennial herb. The leaves grow in clusters on a short stem, with long petioles, shaped like long ovals, with entire margins and several prominent leaf veins. Long stalks emerge from the leaf axils, bearing spicate inflorescences at the top. In summer, it blooms with small, pale purple, funnel-shaped flowers. The capsule is shaped like a small spindle.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Plantain Herb *Herba Plantaginis*, is the entire plant of plantain collected with flowers and dried.</p>
<p>Plantain Seed, *Semen Plantaginis*, is collected from its mature seeds. This product is not more than two millimeters in diameter, is a dark brown particle, and tastes slightly bitter. It is mucilaginous.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The whole grass contains Aucubin C15H24O10 (glycoside). The seeds contain a large amount of mucilage, and other substances including Plantenolsaure C5H8O3 (?), succinic acid, Sfrnin, and Cholin. According to a report by Mr. Takahashi of Japan, the glycoside Plantagin was isolated from the whole grass.</p>
<p>(Pharmacology) According to Mr. Takahashi's experiments with Plantagin, it has a considerable effect on the respiratory center, making respiratory movements deep and slow, and has a significant antitussive effect. It can also excite the secretory nerves, increasing the mucus in the trachea and tracheal branches, and the secretion of digestive juices. However, it has no such effect on the dissolution of blood.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Traditionally, plantain herb and plantain seed are considered diuretics. Plantain seed also has antitussive and antidiarrheal effects. The dosage is three to five grams, used in decoction.</p>
<p>Japanese Folklore: Plantain herb is said to be effective for treating stomach ailments when taken internally as a decoction. Plantain seed is said to be effective for treating eye ailments when taken internally as a decoction.</p>
<p>Orobanchaceae, *Boschniakia glabra*</p>
<p>(Plant) It grows wild in shady places under alpine trees and is an annual parasitic herb. It mostly parasitizes the roots of *Alnus alnobetula* Hart. var. *fruticosa* Winkl. The rhizome is lumpy. The stem is fleshy, cylindrical, usually about 30 cm tall. The leaves are scale-like, arranged like roof tiles, and are yellowish-brown. The top bears a spicate inflorescence, and in summer it blooms with purple-brown tubular flowers. The capsule is spherical.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) *IIerba Boschniakiae*, is the entire plant collected and dried. The rhizome is lumpy, from which it is extracted. One or several stems, the stem is cylindrical, about 100 cm long, rarely reaching 30 cm, generally irregularly curved, and usually has an inflorescence. The surface of the stem is covered with scales, arranged like roof tiles, and is yellowish-brown or dark brown. The fracture surface is spongy. It has no significant odor.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Traditionally, *Boschniakia glabra* is considered a tonic to strengthen the body and replenish essence.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Summer Health Campaigns and Points to Note for Summer Health</h3>
<p>— Hu Songshan</p>
<p>——A speech given on May 20th of the fifth year at the Summer Health Campaign Week in Yancheng County——</p>
<p>The four seasons of the year have different climates, and the diseases that occur also differ accordingly. In summer, the Fire Emperor unleashes his might, and the heat rises high, with the highest temperature of the year. At this time, the most severe, most dangerous, and deadly acute infectious diseases—"cholera," "typhoid fever," "dysentery," and other pathogenic bacteria—and the pathogenic protozoa of "malaria"—spores—emerge, thrive, and multiply. At the same time, the vectors of these infectious diseases, "flies" and "mosquitoes," also breed and multiply, acting as their slaves and lackeys, mediating transmission, assisting in evil, and aiding the wicked. They line up their troops, open up the battle lines, and launch an attack on our lives. This time can be said to be the weather when we are most susceptible to infectious diseases, and it can be said to be the season when we are most prone to death. If we are even slightly careless in our diet, daily life, and all aspects of daily living, and do not pay attention to hygiene, then we will have the opportunity to contract diseases and risk our lives. If we ourselves or someone else does not pay attention to hygiene and contracts an acute infectious disease—"cholera," "typhoid fever," "dysentery," or "malaria"—it will not simply end there. It will also infect others! Therefore, often once a transmission starts, it spreads in all directions, rampages rampant, harms society, deaths are everywhere, and it is unstoppable, as the saying goes, "A spark can start a prairie fire, spreading inexhaustibly." In addition, there is also "heatstroke," which is also a summer disease and is also very dangerous, with the risk of death. The so-called "heatstroke" includes two types of illnesses, one called "heat exhaustion" and the other called "sunstroke." What is called "heat exhaustion"? In weather with extremely high temperatures and saturated air, feeling extremely depressed and having difficulty breathing, resulting in sudden mental confusion and unconsciousness, this is called "heat exhaustion." What is called "sunstroke"? In weather with extremely high temperatures, extremely low humidity, and strong sunlight, being directly exposed to sunlight and becoming mentally confused and unconscious, this is called "sunstroke." This is what is commonly called heatstroke, which is also very dangerous.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, the number of unnatural deaths in our country is as high as six million each year, compared to other countries, and the majority of these six million deaths are due to epidemics. Why is the mortality rate in our country so high? Upon investigation, it goes without saying that it is naturally because the public lacks knowledge and does not pay attention to hygiene, leading to this result. In particular, the failure to pay attention to summer hygiene is the biggest reason. Since summer hygiene is so important, but the general public is so unattentive, what should be done? It is necessary to use this kind of grand and enthusiastic campaign week to promote awareness and arouse national public attention to summer hygiene in particular, in order to protect individual lives, the lives of the masses, and the health of the nation. Otherwise, without engaging in campaigns to attract attention, and the general public still being so inattentive, then during this summer, the lives of individuals, the lives of the masses, and the health of the nation will have no guarantee. Especially this summer, extra attention must be paid. Why? Based on history and experience, we know that there is a major flood every ten years and a minor flood every five years. This year is the year of a minor flood. We also know that epidemics often accompany floods. According to general speculation, this year is also a year of cholera epidemics, so extra attention is needed.</p>
<p>Illness, death, economic losses, population losses, national losses, and ethnic losses are all immeasurable. How terrible and heartbreaking this is! From this perspective, how important is the summer health campaign? Can we neglect it? Can we casually and carelessly not make efforts?</p>
<p>As for the points to note for summer health, the following is a report:</p>
<p>Pay attention to drinking water. Unclean water sources should not be used. Unboiled water should not be drunk.</p>
<p>Pay attention to food. 1. Do not eat old, rotten, fly-infested, or leftover food.</p>
<p>2. Do not eat melons and fruits that have been soaked in raw water or cut open for some time.</p>
<p>3. Do not eat unclean melons, fruits, ice cream, and other foods on street stalls and in stores.</p>
<p>4. Food must be covered with gauze to prevent flies from contacting and leaving germs on it.</p>
<p>5. Do not eat too much, to avoid indigestion. Food staying in the stomach and intestines for too long will rot and decompose, which is a cause of disease.</p>
<p>Avoid eating raw food. Eating raw food is also a cause of disease in summer. Often someone eats raw food in the morning and gets sick in the evening, so it should be avoided.</p>
<p>Eliminate mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are vectors for transmitting malaria, which is very serious. The first excavation of the Panama Canal failed because they harmed the workers, which is ironclad proof. Their larvae are called mosquito larvae, which live in sewage. The elimination method is to drain the sewage in gutters and pits, not allowing it to accumulate, so that the mosquito larvae have no place to survive. Sewage must also be disinfected with formalin or Lysol solution. Mosquitoes must also be eliminated urgently.</p>
<p>Eliminate flies. Flies are vectors for transmitting cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery. Their larvae are called maggots, which live in manure pits. The elimination method is to pour lime milk or carbolic acid water into the manure pit, which can eliminate them completely. For flies, use flypaper, fly swatters, or fly traps to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. Doors and windows must be fitted with screen doors and windows, and mosquito nets must be hung on beds; they must be tightly pressed around the edges to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, which can lead to malaria.</p>
<p>Pay attention to cleanliness and disinfection. All daily necessities and clothing, etc., must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to prevent germs from parasitizing and transmitting diseases. Cleaning means washing frequently. Disinfection can be done by boiling, which is the most convenient, economical, and complete.</p>
<p>Avoid heatstroke. Avoid heatstroke to prevent heatstroke and other causes of acute infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Avoid moving under the hot sun. Walking or working under the hot sun should be avoided to prevent sunstroke.</p>
<p>Avoid sleeping outdoors. Sleeping outdoors on summer nights makes it easy to catch a cold and is a cause of various diseases, so it should be avoided.</p>
<p>In short, we should pay special attention to improving anything that is unhygienic. The above points seem very ordinary, but they are very important. If we follow them, we can naturally avoid diseases.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Q&amp;A about Teeth (33)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 160) Can dental diseases be treated by self-treatment?</p>
<p>Answer: The treatment and repair of dental diseases mostly falls within the scope of dentists. The purpose of this chapter is only to give indications of what patients want to know and should know. Its purpose is to make patients feel the necessity of early treatment when encountering dental diseases, so as to avoid delays; during the treatment period, to know a little about the general procedures of treatment, so as not to often harbor doubts or distrust, hindering the progress of treatment; to be able to cooperate with the dentist and implement the various items he has instructed at home, so as to promote the effectiveness of treatment; if a dentist's diagnosis and treatment cannot be obtained temporarily, to be able to know something about what can be done by oneself to cope with emergencies.</p>
<p>Section 2 Treatment of Dental Caries and Pulp Diseases</p>
<p>(Question 161) How should small cavities that are just beginning be treated?</p>
<p>Answer: You should ask a dentist to first use a dental drill to remove the decayed part of the cavity, then disinfect it with medicine, and then fill it with durable materials. The smaller the cavity, the easier it is to repair, and the better the effect.</p>
<p>(Question 162) How should cavities that already feel painful be treated?</p>
<p>Answer: First, the decayed part should be drilled away, and only after the pain has been cured can it be filled.</p>
<p>(Question 163) After sealing pain-relieving medicine, if the pain is still severe, how should it be treated?</p>
<p>Answer: At this time, the cavity is already deep, and the pulp has become inflamed and painful and cannot be preserved. The pulp should be removed first, and then filled, commonly called nerve extraction.</p>
<p>(Question 164) What is the procedure for extracting the pulp?</p>
<p>Answer: When the pulp is alive, it is unbearably painful to the touch, so it must be killed or anesthetized with medicine before it can be removed. Anesthesia with medicine allows for extraction at that time, while sealing medicine to kill it requires one or two days. When extracting, drill open the pulp chamber and use a very thin, barbed long needle to extract all the pulp in the root canals.</p>
<p>(Question 165) Why must patients strictly abide by the dentist's instructions after the medicine to kill the pulp is sealed?</p>
<p>Answer: The medicine to kill the pulp is very strong, and patients must go back for a follow-up visit at the time agreed upon by the dentist, and must not be overdue, so as to avoid causing apical periodontitis. If you feel that the sealed medicine has fallen out or seeped out halfway, you should immediately inform the dentist.</p>
<p>(Question 166) After the pulp is extracted, what is the filling procedure?</p>
<p>Answer: After the pulp is extracted, for the sake of stability, it is necessary to rest for a week or ten days. If it goes well, then filling can be done. When filling, fill the root canals first, and then rest for two or three days. If there are no abnormalities, the remaining part can be filled. Therefore, the time and surgery required to treat teeth with extracted pulp are three or four times more than those for treating simple cavities. Therefore, the surgical fees charged by dentists are probably about three times higher.</p>
<p>(Question 167) After the root canal is filled, what symptoms may occur?</p>
<p>Answer: Because the filling material in the root canal stimulates the apical periodontium, mild apical periodontitis may occur sometimes, and the teeth may feel slightly floating and uncomfortable, but it can recover after a few days. If the pain continues unabated, the filling material should be removed, and it should be refilled after it has been cured.</p>
<p>(Question 168) How should teeth with decayed pulp be treated?</p>
<p>Answer: If the pulp has already rotted, it will produce a peculiar stench. The root canal should be opened first, and the decayed material should be washed away. Disinfecting medicine should be sealed, and it should be replaced daily or every other day until the cavity has no odor, then it can be filled. Therefore, the procedure is very troublesome. If the apical periodontium is involved, it should be treated according to the treatment method for apical periodontitis in the next section.</p>
<p>(Question 169) How should cavities in baby teeth be treated?</p>
<p>Answer: If baby teeth develop cavities before the time for tooth replacement, you should immediately ask a doctor to fill them, and do not delay, so as to avoid decay and early loss.</p>
<p>(Question 170) Why should teeth that are decayed and cannot be filled, or decayed tooth roots, be extracted early?</p>
<p>Answer: These residual teeth have lost their chewing function. If they are allowed to remain, there is a risk of causing acute infectious apical periodontitis. On the one hand, it is a major base for the accumulation of bacteria and dirt in the mouth. On the other hand, because the residual pulp rots and becomes purulent inside, it is an entry point for pus to enter the human body. Therefore, this source of trouble should be removed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Q&amp;A about Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hancao</p>
<p>(84) Trichinosis</p>
<p>What kind of disease is trichinosis?</p>
<p>This is a disease in which worms parasitize the intestines and muscles of animals.</p>
<p>Who discovered trichinosis?</p>
<p>It was discovered by Mr. Zenker. The Western name is Trichinella spiralis.</p>
<p>Which animals did this worm originally parasitize in?</p>
<p>Most of them parasitize in pigs, and sometimes they also parasitize in white mice, gray mice, rabbits, and dogs. Among them, intestinal trichinella and muscle trichinella can be distinguished.</p>
<p>How do trichinella that parasitize in the human body invade?</p>
<p>Because the larvae of trichinella often exist in pig muscles, people are invaded into the stomach if they eat undercooked pork; then the envelope of the larvae falls off and becomes intestinal trichinella. The mother worms of this intestinal trichinella parasitize in the intestinal wall, and the larvae enter the muscles through the lymphatic vessels and blood vessels, becoming spiral, wrapped in a calcareous envelope. When observed with the naked eye, there are many grayish-white spots in the meat, which are these larvae.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms when suffering from trichinosis?</p>
<p>After infection, there must be an incubation period of three or four days before the disease occurs. The symptoms of the disease can be divided into two stages.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms in the first stage?</p>
<p>In the first stage, there is pressure in the stomach, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and sometimes constipation. At the same time, there is muscle pain and muscle rigidity. Accompanied by chills, shivering, and fever, and the face, especially the eyelids, becomes swollen. Such symptoms last for a week before entering the second stage.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms in the second stage?</p>
<p>When it reaches the second stage, the trichinella larvae in the blood enter the muscles, so the affected muscles are swollen and painful, and reflexes are reduced or disappear. If it invades the masticatory muscles, pharyngeal muscles, and throat and eye muscles, there will be difficulty in chewing or swallowing, hoarseness, and eye pain; especially importantly, if it invades the respiratory muscles, diaphragm muscles, and intercostal muscles, there will be chest pain, insufficient breathing, and difficulty in breathing, and even bronchial pneumonia due to the accumulation of sputum. During this second stage, the trunk and limbs often develop swelling, chills, shivering, and fever persist, or there may be headache, insomnia, confusion, and splenomegaly and meningitis symptoms.</p>
<p>What are the abnormalities in the skin, blood, and urine of patients with trichinosis?</p>
<p>The skin develops creeping rash, urticaria, small hemorrhages, pustular rash, or miliaria. White blood cells increase in the blood, and protein is found in the urine.</p>
<p>What is the prognosis of this disease?</p>
<p>Mild cases are cured in two or three weeks; severe and chronic cases take seven or eight weeks. Thirty to forty out of a hundred people do not recover.</p>
<p>How to treat and prevent?</p>
<p>In the early stage, use strong laxatives to try to eliminate the parasitic worms. When there is muscle pain, use chloroform to rub, apply warm damp cloths locally, bathe, or inject morphine, etc. The method of prevention is to not eat undercooked pork.</p>

<h3>Finance Price Discounts Gradually Decrease, Bid-Up Interest Slightly Stimulated</h3>
<p>Increased by Six Jiao Compared to Last Week</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market initially continued to weaken as many parties closed out positions. Later, the price discount for forward contracts began, decreasing from high levels, which stimulated buying interest and gradually increased prices. Ultimately, the market fluctuated. In the morning, overseas silver markets showed flat prices in both England and the United States. Deferred silver prices in Montreal remained unchanged. Exchange rates slightly decreased. London raw gold increased by one penny. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with both English and American rates unchanged. Customs gold units remained unchanged. The standard bid-up price for gold rose to 1127.3 yuan. Off-market pre-trading opened at 38 yuan. Fuxing, Yongchun Yuan, and Yong exited, retreating to 6 yuan. Chunyuan Yong, Dadecheng, and Dingkang took advantage of low prices to enter, rising to 7.5 yuan. However, the morning opened with low prices. After opening, major players sought different supplies, resulting in a relatively flat market with slight struggles. Later, Huahui Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with both English and American rates unchanged. Some major players in the market cut long positions, causing prices to decline at one point. However, eager buyers took advantage of the low prices. Although the balance tax on silver was unchanged, it slightly improved. Subsequently, transactions became scarce, and the market was extremely calm. The afternoon market opened weakly but then the price discount for forward contracts decreased, stimulating buying interest and gradually increasing prices. However, prices did not break through the 40-yuan mark. Finally, major players sought different supplies, causing the market to fluctuate around 39 yuan with no specific characteristics. The July-August forward contract saw a discount of about 5 yuan offered by long positions, decreasing to around 3.5 yuan. This was because long positions remained on the sidelines, while short positions, concerned that the high price discount would affect futures and that a decline would cause settlement prices to converge, actively offered discounts when prices rose. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 1137.6 yuan, a decrease of 7 jiao from the previous close. Qingfa and Yongfu and Yong exited, retreating to 7 yuan.

<p>The day's market conditions were unstable. The morning opening price was 1137.6 yuan, and the closing price was 1138.9 yuan. The highest price was 1139.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 1136.3 yuan, with a fluctuation of 3.4 yuan. As a result, it increased by 6 jiao compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The current August forward contract was initially offered by short positions at 5 yuan. Major short positions actively offered discounts. Wuchang Xiang Hengyu, although they offered slightly, Yuan Mao Yong Hengyu, Qianchang Xiang, Dadecheng, Tongfeng Heng, Shengyuan Yong, Jingfu, etc. all came to offer discounts, decreasing to 4.5 yuan. Hengchang Yongyu, Qing Yong Xiangfeng, and Qiafeng Yong offered discounts, with slight struggles. Tongfeng Heng, Jingfu, Dadecheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Hengyu offered discounts, retreating to 4.2 yuan.

<h3>Banks Push Out, US Dollar Slightly Tight Recently</h3>

In the morning, overseas telegrams reported that large London contracts were flat in both the near and far term. New York silver markets remained unchanged.

HSBC Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with English and American supply flat. Xinfeng Foreign Firm bought in shillings but remained flat.

Fortunately, banks pushed out, resulting in no special changes. The initial Indian silver price report increased by one anna but remained unchanged. The second report decreased by two, one anna. In the end, it was also very mediocre. At the close, the near-term selling prices were 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 375 for English exchanges and 30.0625 yuan for US dollars. Compared to last Saturday, the English rate was flat, while the US dollar tightened by 0.03125. The forward rates for both English and American exchanges were flat.

<h3>Securities Air Eases, Public Debt Recovers About One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Business Securities Exchange, market conditions improved slightly due to the slight retreat of the Hunan and Guangxi armies, easing the public's opposition. Market sentiment improved slightly, but as prices had already risen significantly last Saturday, it was difficult to continue the upward trend, and the number was limited and lacked continuity. This indicated that there was reluctance to recover the outflow of spot goods. Although the situation was temporarily dull, the root cause remained unresolved, and the strength of both sides would likely be revealed within this week as the settlement approached. Yesterday, the market opened with a unanimous bullish outlook, a common habit of market sentiment. Short covering was the most active, and the large number of long positions on the 35th provided them with a good opportunity. As a result, Type Wu rose by 1.12 yuan, but gradually weakened after entering, rising only by 0.7 or 0.8 jiao. The sudden surge subsided, and the 23rd and others sold a lot in the second session, causing the market to become confused, with inconsistent rises and falls. The number of transactions was very small. In the afternoon, the 48th and 10th absorbed some positions, while the 4th and 11th released some positions. Retail investors showed strong buying interest, the front rows were slightly fatigued, and the back rows regained strength. Before the close, the front rows recovered slightly by 0.1 or 0.2 jiao, but the back rows became fatigued again. In the current environment, the market may temporarily become dull, and the rise and fall of the market may shift to relying on the supply and demand relationship of chips, creating a temporary trend. The results of yesterday's market prices showed a continued increase of 0.5 to 1.1 jiao. The total number of transactions was 10.47 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Although Yunnan Merchants' Yarn Sales Are Uninterrupted, Bid-Up Yarn Dips and Then Turns Back Up</h3>
<p>The yarn market dipped in the morning and recovered in the afternoon, with a calm situation. However, the overseas yarn and cotton market remained strong and bullish, suggesting a possibility of a stable rise. Unfortunately, the yarn in the warehouse still lacked large-scale movement, and there were rumors in the financial community about handing over previously received yarn, which dampened sentiment. In the afternoon, due to optimistic news, the market turned from weak to firm.</p>
<p>Recent Downward Trend Slightly Severe</p>
<p>The bid-up yarn market opened in the morning with low prices across all months, despite the rise in public debt and peaceful news. The near-month decline was particularly severe, as the settlement deadline for this month approached. Rumors circulated that previous long positions were preparing to deliver goods, putting heavy pressure on the market. The forward market was also constrained and declined. As a result, the near-month price fell by 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, a continuous drop of 0.8 jiao. The afternoon opening saw mixed prices across all months, but the momentum was slightly bullish. After the second session, spot yarn from Yunnan was still in demand for coarse yarn, coupled with positive news, causing market prices to trend higher. As a result, all months increased by 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was reported that 1,000 bales of Jifeng were sold, 950 bales were sold, 1,300 dan of Hexing were sold, 600 bales of Taichang were sold, 890 bales of Changyu were sold, 1,450 bales of Taixing were sold, 700 bales of Runkang were sold, 1,100 bales of Xinhua were sold, 800 bales of Cuomo were sold, 1,100 bales of Runkang were sold, 700 bales of Xianghe were sold, and 600 bales of Xincheng were sold. 1,600 bales of Deda were bought, 650 bales of Juxing were bought, 3,300 bales were bought, 850 bales of Renfeng were bought, 1,700 bales of Dachangcheng were bought, 900 bales of Changfeng were bought, 750 bales of Heng were bought, and 700 bales of Shengyuan were bought. The highest and lowest prices of the day and the closing prices are listed below.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Delivery Settlement Reappear, Cotton Market Situation Relaxes Suddenly</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose. As the settlement period for this month approached, rumors circulated that long positions would sell and deliver previously received coarse cotton, amounting to approximately 30,000 to 40,000 dan, which stirred market sentiment. At the same time, the demand for spot cotton from factories was slightly sluggish. In the afternoon, the market recovered following the yarn market.</p>
<p>Bid-Up Cotton Falls Again by Two Jiao</p>
<p>The bid-up cotton market opened in the morning with a negative sentiment. The price of American cotton fell by 1 to 4 pounds, equivalent to a cotton price decrease of 0.05 to 1 rupee and 25 paise. Near-month contracts for Osaka Sanpin cotton fell by 0.1 yuan, while the distant months remained unchanged. Market sentiment was depressed, and there were rumors that long positions in coarse cotton for this month were shifting to selling and delivery, resulting in a relaxed situation. July and August contracts uniformly broke the 4-yuan mark, and new cotton broke the 1-yuan mark. As a result, all months fell by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening showed an extremely weak market. However, after entering, the general expectation was that external cotton would still have upside potential tomorrow, and the yarn market also recovered, leading to a sudden tightening of sentiment and a rise in prices. As a result, all months increased by 0.2 to 0.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was reported that 2,600 dan of Dafu were sold, 3,500 dan of Hexing were sold, 2,900 dan of Hengchang were sold, 1,900 dan of Renfeng were sold, 2,500 dan of Runkang were sold, 1,800 dan of Shengyuan were sold, 1,200 dan of Xinchang were sold, 2,300 dan of Meiji were sold, 3,500 dan of Minghua were sold, 1,500 dan of Yuan Yi were sold, and 1,800 dan of Changfeng were sold. 1,100 dan of Jifeng were bought, 1,500 dan of Deda were bought, 1,100 dan of Tongji were bought, 1,100 dan of Xingchang were bought, 4,300 dan of Dachangcheng were bought, 3,800 dan of Xiecheng were bought, 2,000 dan of Xincheng were bought, 1,600 dan of Mingde were bought, 2,200 dan of Hexing were bought, and 2,300 dan of Shenji were bought. The highest and lowest prices of the day and the closing prices are listed below.</p>
<h3>Lack of Cotton Demand in Bombay Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, the Bombay cotton market followed the rise of American cotton, with all transactions limited to futures traders and well-known local cotton merchants. It was rumored that long positions would receive delivery of all July and August contracts. If true, the availability of certain cotton could be an important factor. At the current or lower prices, long positions are determined not to exit. If prices are high, it may trigger profit-taking. There is a significant lack of demand for various types of cotton. The weekly statistics are appended below (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>
<h3>Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Show Mixed Rises and Falls</h3>
<p>Osaka on the 15th: Near-month futures for Sanpin yarn rose or fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, standing at 197.7 yuan, while distant-month futures stood at 196.2 yuan. Futures for cotton rose or fell by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan, with near-month futures at 64.3 yuan and distant-month futures at 6.095 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Autumn Goods Customers Have Already Started Business</h3>
<p>-Plain, Colored, and Zhigong Silks, Crepe Patterns, etc. Are Now Making Their Debut-</p>
<p>Yesterday, bid-up yarn and cotton and overseas cotton markets all showed slight recoveries, and the cotton cloth market trended steadily. Most of the Eastern goods for this month are still in the hands of brokers. Currently, due to the thin inventory, plain cloth and fine cloth are particularly scarce, and the market prices have risen by several cents to 0.15 yuan per piece. The heavy and light coarse cloth produced by British Jardine Matheson Foreign Firm was sold most briskly last Friday and Saturday due to high market prices, with a total of more than a thousand bales. There was no intention to sell further yesterday, and orders must be placed at the set prices. The scattered sales of colored cloth pieces from various sources were also quite good. Summer goods such as white-background printed fabrics were sold out quickly. Autumn plain and colored Zhigong silk fabrics and wool fabrics are now making their debut, but the current selling prices are too harsh and do not cover costs. Therefore, local wholesale shops are purchasing goods with corresponding prices. The market prices for Zhigong silk, one of the Eastern goods' "Four Gentlemen," remained unchanged. The prices for new colored Zhigong serge produced by the Hongzhang Guangzhong Factory rose by 0.025 yuan. Serge from domestic and foreign factories is now available, with current prices ranging from 0.295 to 0.3 yuan. Customer orders were generally calm. The Changsha group continued to procure goods such as colored and plain silk fabrics. The Sichuan and Yunnan groups continued to procure more than 200 pieces of fine twill cloth. The Shandong group's demand slightly shifted, and goods such as printed fabrics, satin, crow silk, striped poplin, and crepe wool were being purchased.</p>
<h3>Eastern White Serge Sells Uniquely Well</h3>
<p>The trend for white serge has softened in recent days. Market sentiment at the association and tea parties has been weak, and retail prices have generally become cheaper. Western goods are more expensive and have slower sales. Domestic merchants have little profit and are unwilling to promote sales. Although Eastern goods have broad sales channels, there are abundant arrivals. Yesterday, Fengyu Baishuifang white serge was sold uniformly for 6 yuan. Zhanghua 918 was priced at 3.25 yuan. Mitsui uniformly sold for 6 yuan, Zhanghua 918 was priced at 3.25 yuan. Sanjing, Iwai, and Abe City Yiji called for Eastern goods with double yellow borders to uniformly sell for 3.6 yuan, double red borders for 3.55 yuan, second-grade for 3.25 yuan, and those without permits could be sold for 0.3 to 0.4 yuan cheaper, but all merchants refused to sell.</p>
<h3>Grains Rumors of Short Positions Delivering Goods, Flour Prices Plummet This Month</h3>
<p>Distant Months Also Pulled Down by 0.03 to 0.04 Yuan</p>
<p>Intense Competition Between Long and Short Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices across all months consistently saw a sharp decline. Although quoted prices for foreign wheat were slightly better by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, the expectation of peaceful times and the sunny weather led to a consistent loosening of sentiment both inside and outside the industry. Although long positions for this month intended to squeeze shorts, the majority of short positions were mostly factories. Therefore, in such an environment, there were rumors of delivering as much goods as possible, causing the market to plummet sharply. The opening price was 0.185 yuan, but the closing price fell to a low of 0.1 yuan, a massive difference of 1.5 jiao compared to the high prices of the previous week. The size of the drop shows the importance of speculation that cannot be ignored. Distant months also declined by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan due to factory hedging and the exit of many floating long positions. At the afternoon opening, the price for this month improved due to rumors that a small number of long positions were still buying, and both sides were in a difficult position, each with the intention to hold their ground, causing the opening price to rise by 0.04 yuan. The distant months were initially very flat, but then were brought up by 0.01 yuan due to the recent price. Subsequently, the actual sales were weak, and the arrival of wheat was smooth. This situation is unlikely to last for long.</p>
<h3>With Sunny Weather, the Decline in Wheat Futures Becomes More Severe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, prices across all months consistently declined. With good weather and the expectation of peaceful times, and as it is currently the peak season for new wheat, there is no reason for high prices without special circumstances. Therefore, opening prices for both near-term and distant-term contracts fell by 0.03 to 0.06 yuan, and trading across all sessions was unusually brisk. At the afternoon opening, transactions were slightly lighter, but the market remained weak. This month's market was particularly fatigued due to the increasing abundance of arrivals. As a result, the price for this month fell by 0.08 yuan in the morning and afternoon, while the rest fell by 0.04 to 0.07 yuan. In the current wheat spot market, prices for high-quality wheat remain expensive due to the arrival of goods not yet being fully smooth. For example, Mingguang, Xuzhou, and Linhuai Pass wheat are priced at 4.36 yuan (the lowest price for old wheat was only 4.2 yuan), Huai'an wheat is priced at 4.15 yuan, Hankou wheat is priced at 4.16 yuan, Shuangyuan wheat is priced at 4.02 yuan, and Kunshan wheat is priced at 70% of its original value, opening at 3.5 yuan. Fuxin took 1,400 bags, and Fufeng took 100 bags. It is said that this new wheat is mostly for trial purposes.</p>
<h3>Broad Beans Suffer Setback as Market Price Peaks</h3>
<p>All sources of new broad beans are now on the market, and the supply is increasing daily, causing purchasers to become selective and the market price to be suppressed immediately. For example, the price of green broad beans from Changxing is about 3.23 yuan (125 jin per market hu), but there are no transactions because the quality of the beans is still quite damp and soft. White broad beans from Ningbo Jiang fell slightly, and more than 380 bags were opened for sale. Yesterday, 170 bags of large-piece white broad beans from Jiading were first listed, priced at 4.3 yuan, and were purchased by the Yangzhou group. 370 bags of medium-quality white broad beans from Yuhang were priced at 4.5 yuan and were purchased by Dongyang, but the quality of the above was also not good.</p>
<h3>Late Indica Rice Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of late indica rice was not strong. There were only scattered small batches from Jiangxi and the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang regions, but the cloudiness was gradually decreasing. The market was still in a relatively balanced situation. Yesterday, the total turnover in the city was only more than 4,000 bags. However, the rice was selling quite actively. The Ningbo group was purchasing Jiangxi Zhongguan machine rice, the Fuzhou group was purchasing more than 1,000 bags of early machine rice, the Xiamen group was purchasing more than 200 bags of Xiang rice, the Quanzhou group was procuring Jiangbei machine rice, and this street was also inquiring. With the active sales of local rice, the market is expected to remain strong, and the price of rice in Guangdong province is high and has not yet returned to normal. Yesterday, the Guangdong group was also inquiring in the market. If a suitable transport plan can be arranged, a trial shipment may be possible soon.</p>
<h3>Thin Indica Rice and Thick Japonica Rice Markets Are Both Dull</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total arrival from various groups was more than 20 (a total of more than 4,000 dan), but sales on this street remained light, and purchases were moving slowly. Only 600-700 bags of thin indica rice and 400 bags of thick japonica rice were purchased by the Dalian Longhai group. Therefore, the market continued to be weak. The price of thick early japonica rice was lower by a few jiao, and the price of thin indica rice was also lower by a few cents. Du Yangjian's production was very small, and the price remained unchanged. The prices of the Yinbian Yuan market were also mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 22-23 boats arrived from various regions downstream. The sale of white japonica rice in the market remained flat, with prices for high-quality rice barely standing, while medium and second-quality rice were slightly fatigued by 0.03-0.05 yuan. The sale of thin indica rice was sluggish, and the price was weak. The price of Yinbian Yuan was relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Seafood The Current Season for Agar-Agar, Market Prices Are the Most Popular</h3>
<p>Kelp and Kelp Threads Both Enter Fatigue</p>
<p>(Kelp) Due to sluggish customer sales and the inability to move inventory, and with the new season not far away, merchants with large inventories are all eager to sell, causing market prices to fall step by step. Yesterday, vendors were selling Nemuro kelp for 8.9 yuan, while Hamamaka, Kunashiri, Atsugeshi, and Kawaji, etc., could be reduced by 0.02-0.03 yuan, Oni kelp for 8.5 yuan, Head kelp for 8.3 yuan, Cat's Paw for 7.7 yuan, Selection Foot for 8 yuan, Second Grade for 7.6 yuan, and Third Grade for 6.2 yuan. Looking at the current situation, the market may have a tendency to fall again.</p>
<p>(Kelp Threads) The market is also soft, and the number of goods has not been opened for a long time. Vendors sell Makishin Kan goods for 9.8 yuan, Atsugeshi for 9.5 yuan, and Osaka Yuyuan for 20.6 yuan.</p>
<p>(Agar-Agar) Because it is the summer season, it is the peak sales season, so customers from all sources are purchasing. However, the production source is not strong, and goods are sold as soon as they arrive, resulting in little inventory. Vendors are consistently tightening their selling prices. Yesterday, number goods opened at 325 yuan for 10 pieces of Shuijing Brand and 316 yuan for 5 pieces of Jinhu Brand, an increase of more than 20 yuan compared to the previous trading, and the vendors' buying intentions are very strong, making the market extremely popular.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Guangdong Coarse White List Price Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Transaction Volume Decreases</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat. The association's listed prices for coarse sand were 22.1 yuan for spot goods and 6.85 yuan for re-exported goods. The original prices remained unchanged, and there were few transactions. Spot goods for Eastern White No. 8 rose by 0.1 yuan. YT Mark traded at 21.5 yuan, No. 9 at 21.5 yuan, No. 4 at 22.2 yuan, re-exported No. 4 at 7.25 yuan, No. 8 at 6.8 yuan, and No. 9 at 6.4 yuan, with few transactions. The market for local factory refined white sugar was relatively soft. For example, Zhenji Jinxin and Dahua No. 1 were all listed at the original prices, and there were few sales. The number goods opened by Chaobang included high-quality cotton red at 12.8 yuan and second-quality at 12.3 yuan, with more than 200 bags traded, and high-quality Banan Qing at 9.7 yuan, with 60-70 bags traded. Xinghua group's Da Gong powder was listed at 18 yuan, an increase from the previous price. However, as this goods was imported from Nanguan with a Yuan permit that could be certified, re-export was difficult, and vendors were watching and not purchasing. The joint company's bid-up period expired yesterday, with a total quota of 6,258 bags of Guangdong coarse products. The bid prices remained the same. As a result, 628 bags of coarse white sugar from Guangzhou's Five Sheep area were traded at 21.7 yuan, 10 bags of sand white sugar from the city center were traded at 20.7 yuan, 10 bags of No. 2 refined white sugar were traded at 20.8 yuan, and 10 bags of No. 4 refined white sugar were traded at 20.5 yuan. It was also heard that Dutch coarse sand was imported yesterday by the Zhibade wheel with over 2,000 bags, and domestic Wufu white rock sugar was imported by the Taiyuan wheel with 259 cases.</p>
<h3>Hardware No. 2 折 (zhe) Lead Sheets Are Readily Procured by Factories</h3>
<p>Recently, due to active procurement by cigarette factories, toy factories, and ordnance factories, etc., No. 2 white lead sheets are insufficient to meet market demand. The number of arrivals is small, and there is a sudden shortage of goods circulating in the market. Therefore, prices are stronger than before. Currently, cash transactions are priced at 140 yuan per barrel. It has been found that only 30-40 barrels were offered on the market yesterday, and the amount of bottom goods is increasingly scarce. It is feared that prices will be difficult to decrease in the short term.</p>
<h3>Large Order for Steel Plate</h3>
<p>Recently, because certain canneries placed large orders for 200-pound steel plate, over three to four thousand boxes of the product in the market were purchased, causing prices to rise. Each box now costs 32.5 yuan, about one yuan more than before. Moreover, overseas orders of four to five hundred tons were placed yesterday, with each box priced at 7.4 gold yuan, about two jiao higher than before.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Market Increasingly Active</h3>
<p>Factories Holding Prices High, Resulting in No Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York market was closed due to Sunday. The spot price of Yokohama silk opened at 730 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan compared to last Saturday. The futures price was 728 yuan, an increase of 19 yuan. The domestic and overseas silk markets have seen an increase in confidence, especially in Shanghai. However, overseas orders did not materialize in Shanghai because of the high prices. For example, White Filature Dancing Grade 13.15 was priced at 720 yuan, and 20.22 was priced at 680 yuan, which foreign merchants are still considering. Therefore, the White Filature silk market was firm yesterday. In addition, a small amount of White Filature B-grade silk, regardless of evenness (20.22 denier) and grey silk (7 li), was sold with little price change.</p>
<h3>Rayon Sales Stagnant, Prices Unchanged</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of transactions with inland merchants, the rayon market remains flat, with no price changes. Transactions included: a Hangzhou silk factory purchased 40 boxes of 150-denier Sini Ayer No. 2 bright yarn at 106 yuan per box, excluding tax; 25 boxes of 150-denier Golden Buddha brand semi-dull yarn at 125 yuan per box, excluding tax; a silk ribbon factory in the Nanshi area of Shanghai purchased over 20 boxes of 120-denier Goldfish Round Room brand at 390 yuan per box, 120-denier Sky Bridge brand at 415 yuan per box, and 150-denier Sky Bridge brand at 410 yuan per box. Transactions were few, but inventory is also very low. At yesterday's auction by Ruishi Mo, 14 boxes of goods were sold at a price of 416 yuan and some jiao for 120-denier Sky Bridge brand, 423 yuan for 150-denier Sky Bridge brand, and 430 yuan for 150-denier Beauty brand dull yarn. These prices were all higher than the market price.</p>
<h3>Qimen Fragrant Tea Sells Especially Well</h3>
<p>Sales of Various Zhenmei Green Teas Vary</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign-firm red and green teas were still active. Among them, Qimen fragrant tea had very brisk sales in both British and Russian firms. Moreover, the current supply is not abundant, making the market particularly firm, with prices marked up to 37-38 yuan. Qimen black tea, Yunlu, also sold well, but while there were many transactions, most have not yet been recorded and will be released today. Native-firm Zhenmei tea also appeared active. Xiehe selectively purchased about 500 pieces at prices ranging from 58 to 63 yuan. Wenzhou Zhenmei was also actively purchased, with over 300 pieces bought at 42 yuan. Xiehe also slightly purchased other grades of core-bud tea. Tunxi core-bud tea was sold by Baochang and Yihe at prices ranging from 125 to 139 yuan. Dude purchased over 200 pieces of Tun Zhen at prices ranging from 85 to 89 yuan. Other grades of Xiumei tea were purchased by Tianyu in about 100 pieces at prices ranging from 42 to 63 yuan. The trade in Pingshui pearl tea was still sluggish, with only Tianyu and Tongfu each selling dozens of pieces at a price of 56 yuan.</p>

<p>Special Telegraphic Supplement</p>
<h3>Brief Account of the Method for Collect Telegrams in China</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The method of collect telegrams has been implemented for international telegrams and domestic news telegrams for many years, providing general convenience. However, ordinary telegrams used by the domestic public have not been opened, so the business has not developed. In order to facilitate domestic public communication, the Ministry of Communications promulgated "Fifteen Articles on the Method of Collect Telegrams in China" on May 27th of this year, which came into effect on June 1st. A brief description of the key procedures is provided below:</p>
<p>Procedures for the Sender's Request</p>
<p>When making a request, the sender should obtain a blank application form from the local telegraph office and fill in the following items: Name, occupation, and detailed address of the applicant (if there is a telegraphic registration number, please indicate it); Place of origin of the telegram; Name and detailed address of the recipient (if there is a telegraphic registration number, please indicate it); Type of telegram to be sent, etc. Submit it to the telegraph office for submission to the Telegraph Administration of the Ministry of Communications for approval. After receiving the application, the Telegraph Administration will instruct the receiving telegraph office to contact the recipient for agreement, fill out the "Voluntary Application for Payment of Domestic Collect Telegrams," sign and seal it, and prepay a deposit sufficient for half a month's telegram fees to the receiving telegraph office. The office will then submit it to the Telegraph Administration, which will instruct the sending telegraph office to notify the sender to begin sending telegrams.</p>
<p>Procedures for the Recipient's Request</p>
<p>If the request is made by the recipient, a written statement should be made to the local telegraph office, stating that the recipient will be responsible for the telegram fees for certain types of telegrams sent by a specific person from a specific location in China. With the consent of the local telegraph office, the recipient will fill out the "Voluntary Application for Payment of Domestic Collect Telegram Fees," sign and seal it, and pay a deposit. The office will then submit it to the Telegraph Administration for investigation by the sending office and to notify the sender to complete the application and begin sending telegrams.</p>
<p>Procedures for Sending Telegrams</p>
<p>The telegraph office will provide the sender with a telegram receipt book. When sending a telegram, the receiving staff of the telegraph office will sign the book as proof of receipt, without issuing a receipt. However, the sender should submit a sample of their seal or signature to the telegraph office for verification. When sending a telegram, the sender should affix their seal or signature at the bottom of the telegram paper for verification.</p>
<p>Procedures for Settling Telegram Fees</p>
<p>The receiving telegraph office will prepare a monthly statement based on the telegrams received and settle the telegram fees with the recipient. After receiving the statement, the recipient must pay the fees within five days at the latest. If the fees are not paid by the sixth month, the receiving telegraph office will collect the telegram fees from the recipient one by one before delivering the telegrams. If the fees are still not paid after another five days, the receiving office will deduct the fees from the deposit. If the deposit is insufficient, the remaining amount will still be pursued. At the same time, an official telegram will be sent to the Telegraph Administration to notify the sending office to revoke the sender's right to send telegrams in accordance with this method.</p>
<p>Advantages of This Method</p>
<p>The business operations of major commercial firms often rely on their branches in various locations to promote sales. The quantity of sales and the business situation in various locations must be reported to the head office by telegram every day in order to plan for expansion or contraction. This type of commercial firm telegram is best suited for using the "Collect Telegram Method," because all the telegram fees sent by the branches are paid by the head office. This gives the head office the right to control communications, while the branches are only responsible for sending telegrams, which is convenient for both parties. Furthermore, the telegram receiving procedure relies on signatures in the receipt book without issuing receipts, which eliminates the need to calculate telegram fees on the spot, significantly increasing speed.</p>
<h3>Talking About Chinese Telegraph Machines Invented by Chinese People</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>We all know that Chinese telegraphy uses numbers to replace characters, which is an indirect way of transmission. Although this indirect transmission method has various shortcomings, Chinese characters are not like foreign words that are pieced together letter by letter. Its extensive and complex vocabulary cannot be transmitted by current telegraph machines. Therefore, some enthusiasts of the national phonetic movement have been advocating the use of phonetic symbols to replace the current four-code telegraph, but the following difficulties have also arisen: The social application of phonetic symbols has not yet reached the point of widespread use, and most of the public still use the original characters to send telegrams. The phonetic symbol alphabet has many letters, which is not suitable for the transmission of new-style sending and receiving machines. Phonetic symbols have difficulties with the four tones and homophones. Receiving a telegram that is entirely in phonetic symbols still requires guesswork. Therefore, using phonetic symbols to transmit Chinese telegrams still cannot solve the difficulty of directly transmitting characters. In this article, I will introduce Chinese telegraph machines that have been invented by Chinese people in recent years that can directly transmit Chinese characters. Although these machines have not yet been used in telegraph offices, they are theoretically flawless and will soon be approved by the authorities and adopted by telegraph offices across the country.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there are currently two types of Chinese telegraph machines that have been successfully invented: those designed by Mr. Cen Shilong and Mr. Wang Bonian. I will briefly introduce the principles of these two telegraph machines to readers.</p>
<p>Cen's Chinese Telegraph Machine: The principle behind this type of telegraph machine is as follows: It arranges 10,000 commonly used Chinese characters according to the layout of coordinate paper, with ten rows and ten columns vertically and horizontally. Each grid has ten lines. The horizontal grid represents the thousands place, the horizontal row represents the hundreds place, the vertical grid represents the tens place, and the vertical row represents the ones place. The position of each character is arranged according to the above-mentioned thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones places of the military code number. For example, if the code for the character "电" (dian, electricity) is "7193," then the position of the character should be in the eighth horizontal grid (from right to left), the second row, the tenth grid downward, and the fourth character. (Note: Because the first grid and the first row are both zero positions, one must be added.) Chinese characters arranged in this way are made into inverted type wheels using a lightweight chemical alloy. The movement of the type wheels is controlled by a horizontal feed and a vertical feed gear. The action of the gears is controlled by the current sent by the other party. Direct transmission of Chinese telegraphs is thus completed. Mr. Cen Shilong has spared no effort in researching Chinese telegraph machines. After inventing this method of transmitting Chinese telegrams, he went a step further and designed an automatic telegraph machine to transmit Chinese telegrams, so as not to affect the original speed of the telegraph. This machine has not yet been publicly tested because its structure is more complicated. With Mr. Cen's perseverance and talent, I think the government will definitely have ways to encourage him to successfully manufacture the machine and put it into practical use as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Wang's Chinese Telegraph Machine: Mr. Wang's invented Chinese telegraph machine has three types: A, B, and C. The Type A Chinese telegraph machine is suitable for use with Morse machines and wireless telegraph earphones currently used in China. The machine is equipped with a character disk, with 100 lines and 100 characters in each line, totaling 10,000 characters. The disk is equipped with a handle that can be moved at will. Next to the handle is a pointer. When sending a telegram, move the pointer to any character in the disk and press down. The corresponding code for that character will be automatically sent to the circuit. A common Chinese typewriter is installed in the receiving telegraph office. The characters in the disk are replaced with numbers. When the receiving operator receives the number code, they align it with the number in the disk and press down. The Chinese typewriter can then type out the corresponding character. The Type B Chinese telegraph machine is suitable for Weishi and Keli automatic machines currently used in China. The structure and usage method of this machine are exactly the same as Type A, but it needs to be equipped with a Keli keyboard perforator. When sending a telegram, move the pointer on the character disk to any character in the disk and press down. The corresponding code for that character will be automatically punched on the oiled paper strip by the keyboard perforator. The punched oiled paper strip is then sent out using the Weishi automatic sending machine. On the receiving side, the Keli receiving and re-punching machine receives it. The oiled paper strip received by the Keli receiving and re-punching machine is then placed in the Type C Chinese telegraph machine, which automatically prints out the characters.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's invented Chinese telegraph machine has been successfully manufactured. It is said that the Ministry of Communications has specially approved Mr. Wang to go to Beijing for a public test. I hope to have better news to report to readers in the next issue of this publication.</p>
<h3>Points to Note for Gentlemen Sending Telegrams</h3>
<p>Gentlemen sending telegrams, if you pay attention to the following points when sending telegrams, you will definitely be able to improve the telegraph speed invisibly!</p>
<p>Add the original characters to self-translated codes: It is inevitable that there will be errors in self-translation of codes when you are busy! If you add the original characters next to the code, then the telegraph office will have the opportunity to proofread your telegram after receiving it. If there is a mistranslation, they can correct it for you immediately.</p>
<p>Write telegrams clearly: If the writing in the telegram is scribbled, it is easy for the telegraph office staff to misread the words when they are busy, resulting in errors. For example, in English telegrams, cursive lowercase A and OO, ON and UE, LB and F, etc., are prone to errors due to unclear writing. If a clarification is required, it will inevitably delay the time. If no clarification is sought, the error will occur! As for Chinese telegraph characters, all simplified characters and cursive characters are bound to cause errors, affecting the effectiveness of the telegram. Therefore, regardless of whether it is a Chinese or English telegram, it is best to write the telegram clearly in regular script so that it is easy to understand at a glance, guaranteeing that there will be no errors!</p>
<p>Write the recipient's name and address in detail: In the past, in order to save money, senders often shortened the recipient's name and address as much as possible, resulting in many cases of "improper delivery," "time-consuming delivery," or "misdelivery." Now, for Chinese telegrams, the sender's name and address within thirteen characters are charged as three characters, so you don't have to reduce the number of characters as before, which may lead to misdelivery.</p>
<p>Write the sender's own name and address at the bottom of the telegram: If the sender's name and address are written in detail at the bottom of the telegram, then if there is any "undeliverable" or other situation with the telegram, the telegraph office can notify you according to the name and address written. If the name and address are not indicated at the bottom of the telegram, it will be impossible to notify you, which may delay your important business!</p>
<h3>A Historical Observation of Telegraph Administration Organization</h3>
<p>Since the Republic of China, the telegraph administration organization in China can be divided into four periods: the first period was the era of the Beijing government, the second period was the early era of the National Government, the third period was the recent era, and the fourth period is the future era. These are described separately below: In the era of the Beijing government, wireless telegraph stations and telephone bureaus were directly under the ministry, while long-distance telephones were handled concurrently by the telephone bureaus. Due to the particularly heavy workload of wired telegraphs, they were managed by region. Regional management agencies were established between the Ministry of Communications and the various telegraph bureaus. The names of these management agencies changed from time to time, and the regional divisions were also increased or decreased, but the nature of their transit functions remained unchanged. The telegraph administration organization during this period was mainly based on wired telegraphs.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the National Government, the organization of wired telegraphs and local telephones remained the same. However, with the rapid development of wireless telegraphs and long-distance telephones, the "Wireless Telegraph and Telephone Management Office" was established to manage all wireless telegraph stations in the country. The "Long-Distance Telephone Traffic Management Office" was established to manage long-distance telephone affairs across the country by region. Later, the "Wireless Telegraph and Telephone Management Office" was reorganized into the "International Telecommunications Bureau," with the two main functions of handling international communications and domestic wireless communications. The "Long-Distance Telephone Traffic Management Office" was originally divided by line, but later it was reorganized into the "Long-Distance Telephone Management Office," with the provincial area as the division standard. At this time, the telegraph administration organization in China was divided into four major systems: wired telegraphs, wireless telegraphs, local telephones, and long-distance telephones.</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, the Ministry of Communications has felt that the telegraph administration organization was inevitably scattered. In order to centralize power and save expenses, it has vigorously sought reforms. The first thing that has been implemented is the merger of bureaus and stations, merging the various wireless telegraph stations and wired telegraph bureaus to establish local telegraph offices. Where there are no local telegraph offices, they are subject to the command of the regional telegraph administration bureau due to factual relations. The second is the merger of telegraph and telephone bureaus. All ministry-run telephone bureaus across the country, except for a few bureaus with larger projects and particularly heavy workloads, are merged with local telegraph bureaus to establish telegraph bureaus. The third is the merger of wired telegraphs and long-distance telephones, abolishing the "Long-Distance Telephone Management Office" and transferring the management rights of long-distance telephones in each province and region to the Telegraph Administration Bureau. The long-distance telephone business organizations are also merged with the telegraph departments to establish jointly. At this time, the telegraph administration organization in China has merged wired telegraphs, wireless telegraphs, local telephones, and long-distance telephones into a unified system.</p>
<p>Since telegraph and telephone services have been merged and managed, a complete set of organizational rules is needed to comply with them. The Ministry of Communications promulgated the "Organizational Rules of the Telegraph Administration Bureau" on May 13th, and ordered the whole country to implement them from June 1st. The Administration Bureau is divided into four sections: General Affairs, Telegraph Affairs, Telephone Affairs, and Engineering Affairs, and one accounting office. The Telegraph Affairs section is divided into Wired, Wireless, and Business sections, which are responsible for the wired telegraph service, wireless telegraph service, and wired and wireless telegraph business matters in the entire region, respectively. The Telephone Affairs section is divided into Local, Long-Distance, and Business sections, which are responsible for the local telephone, long-distance telephone traffic, and local and long-distance telephone business matters in the entire region, respectively. The Engineering Affairs section is divided into Machinery Lines, and Materials sections, which are responsible for telecommunications machinery, telecommunications lines, and telecommunications materials in the entire region, respectively. However, in areas where there are no local or long-distance telephones, or where there are established but the business is simple, no telephone affairs section is established, and its responsibilities are merged into the telegraph affairs section. If the affairs of the section are simple, the number of divisions may be reduced. The purpose of the future telegraph administration organization is to implement a unified plan for the overall situation on the one hand, and to achieve the effect of adapting to local conditions on the other hand, aiming to concentrate power, save expenses, and increase office efficiency.</p>
<p>Looking at the changes in the telegraph administration organization since the Republic of China, it has changed from simple to complex, and then from complex to simple. The reason for changing from simple to complex is to seek the rapid development of new businesses, while the reason for changing from complex to simple is to focus on rational management. Although the trends are different, the effects are initially the same.</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A Column</h3>
<p>This publication has specially opened a Q&amp;A column. Social figures are welcome to ask about telephone sending and receiving procedures, unclear points in telecommunications regulations, or any telecommunications knowledge they wish to inquire about. This publication will provide a detailed answer.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zengxiang from Nanchang asks:</p>
<p>Which coastal radio stations in China and abroad provide sending and receiving services for ship telegrams? Which ones do not? In particular, I am most eager to know about those in China.</p>
<p>(Answer) There are a total of five coastal radio stations in China: Shanghai, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Tianjin, and Yantai. There is one in Hankou, which will be opened soon.</p>
<p>Is there a fixed regulation for which coastal radio station should transmit ship telegrams for ships in a certain area? (For example, if a ship is traveling between Hankou and Anhui, which station should be responsible for relaying it?)</p>
<p>(Answer) When sending ship telegrams, you should first estimate the distance the ship is currently traveling. If the ship is traveling between Hankou and Anhui, it should be relayed by the Shanghai radio station. When the Hankou radio station is established in the future, it will be relayed by Hankou. If the ship is in the Bohai Sea, it should be relayed by the Yantai radio station.</p>
<p>According to the examples given in the rules for Chinese and English formats, such as "(Official Cabin No. 10, Wang Liangji, Sinming, Qingdao)" and "(Nelson SS Sinming Tsingtaoradio)," should SS also be added before Sinming in Chinese? Should (Radio) also be added after Qingdao? Should Sinming be written as two characters or one character? Should Qingdao be written as two characters or one character? (Is Radio written as a separate word? Or is it attached to the place name and not counted as a word? Please provide details. How many words should (Tsingtaoradio) be counted as?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is not necessary to add SS before Sinming in Chinese. It is also not necessary to add (Radic) after Qingdao. Sinming and Qingdao are both counted as two characters for billing. (Tsingtaoradio) in English is counted as one word for billing.</p>
<p>Chunqiu</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Rongyu)</p>
<p>In the past, there was a traveler who saw three old men in the field, each over a hundred years old, working together to weed the crops. He got out of his carriage and asked the three old men how they had achieved such longevity. The eldest old man stepped forward and said, "I sleep at night without covering my head." The middle old man stepped forward and said, "My wife is ugly." The youngest old man stepped forward and said, "I eat sparingly, according to my appetite." How meaningful are the words of the three old men! That is why they can live so long.</p>
<p>This is a poem called "Three Old Men" written by Mr. Ying Zhen of the Jin Dynasty. Although it is an old antique, it coincides with modern hygiene methods. If you try it according to the prescription, it will be more effective than getting a "Vitamin C Life-Saving" shot! Because "breathing fresh air," "moderation in sexual desire," and "careful eating" are all known to be important, but few people can put them into practice. Especially people in the city, who spend all night partying and indulging in wine and food, are bound to compromise their health. After reading this poem, do you not have any warning?</p>
<h3>Remembering "Old Buddha Chen"</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>The person "Old Buddha Chen" is worth commemorating because in the fifth and sixth days of May in the twenty-second year of Daoguang in the Former Qing Dynasty, many British warships dared to sail into the Wusongkou. Seeing the fluttering flags blocking the sea, "Old Buddha Chen," who was originally the Jiangnan Admiral and was transferred to defend Wusong only ten days earlier, naturally could not surrender when the enemy approached the city, as it would violate the orders of his superiors. Therefore, "Old Buddha Chen" immediately led his subordinates, day and night, to set up a death camp along the coast to fight a desperate battle with the enemy.</p>
<p>At that time, "Old Buddha Chen" was very strict in governing the army. At the moment of mobilization, he issued a military order: "Anyone who takes a bundle of firewood or grass from the people... will be beheaded." Therefore, his army could be said to be impeccable. Unexpectedly, the camp was barely set up. In less than a day, British warships had already approached and opened fire first, attacking our western battery. "Old Buddha Chen" directed the battle for two hours and drove back the British warships. Unfortunately, Governor Niu Jian, stationed in Baoshan City, heard the news of the victory and wanted to share the credit. Unexpectedly, he rode in a sedan chair, followed by hundreds of soldiers, and was spotted by British soldiers as soon as he arrived at Shanghai Tang. They fired a cannon, and the exploding shell landed right in front of Niu Jian's sedan chair, almost scaring him out of his wits. He hurriedly retreated. The enemy knew that there were no reinforcements, and tried their best to attack our battery again. "Old Buddha Chen" resisted with his isolated army, refusing to yield. Hey! Suddenly, Xu Zhou Commander Wang Zhiyuan came to "Old Buddha Chen" and suggested surrender. "Old Buddha Chen" was furious, and Zhiyuan fled with Niu Jian. "Old Buddha Chen" stood still, fighting his way through a hail of bullets. In the end, he was wounded in the left flank and fell to the ground. However, he still struggled to get up, still waving the flag with his right hand, shouting not to retreat and encouraging his soldiers. Later, he died in battle due to his serious injuries, and Wusong, a strategic stronghold in the southeast, was lost.</p>
<p>"Old Buddha Chen's" body was later carried by soldier Liu Guobiao and hidden in the reeds outside the east gate of Baoshan. After seven days, it had not yet been collected. Chen Tinghuang, the magistrate of Jiading, went and wept over the body and took care of the funeral. In the early days of the Opium War, the Qing court received a report and posthumously named "Old Buddha Chen" the Duke of Zhongmin and established a special ancestral hall in Baoshan City (now the County Junior High School). The portrait of "Old Buddha Chen" is still preserved to this day, and his memorial day is on May 8th. His name was "Huacheng," his style name was "Lianfeng," and he was from Tongan County, Fujian. In his youth, he could walk underwater and swim hundreds of miles. The people of Jia and Bao called him "Old Buddha Chen" because he shared weal and woe with the soldiers and was able to defend the coast and protect our local area.</p>
<h3>Bare Arms and Legs</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Since women gained liberation, their arms have also been liberated. The sleeves of cheongsams have gradually retreated from the wrists to the elbow, and even further to an inch or two from the shoulders. The sleeves have already retreated as far as they can go, so people's eyes naturally move downwards to the legs. The trouser legs, originally reaching the ankles, have been shortened to the knees, and even further to seven or eight inches above the knees. Thus, when summer comes, women's cheongsams are almost like vests on the upper body, and even with the high slits of the cheongsams, the trouser legs are barely visible. Both jade arms and jade legs are completely exposed.</p>
<p>Every year, children need to be vaccinated against smallpox to avoid the danger of contracting it. When short-sleeved cheongsams first became popular, mothers generally vaccinated their young daughters on their legs instead of their arms, saying that the cheongsam sleeves were getting shorter day by day, and it would be unsightly if large smallpox scars were visible on their arms. At that time, I greatly admired their thoughtfulness. Later, the cheongsam sleeves really did shrink to the shoulders, and I admired their foresight even more. But times are constantly evolving, and now the trouser legs are also gone. I wonder what the mothers who were so thoughtful for their daughters in the past will do. I also wonder where the mothers who are vaccinating their daughters today will inoculate them to ensure complete safety.</p>
<p>In the past, because women didn't wear socks in the summer, the sock factory owners appealed for a strict ban on bare feet. But now, bare arms and legs are prevalent, and I think the fabric store owners may also make an appeal in the future. However, here, I want to sincerely appeal to the modern-loving women to expose their esteemed arms and legs less if possible, because the motive for exposing arms and legs is only to show their healthy beauty. The legs and arms of our country's women, who lack exercise, are mostly either too thin or too fat, and there is nothing to see. Some are even covered with bedbug bites and frostbite scars, which really make people not dare to admire them.</p>
<h3>The Phoenixes Change Nests</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Fine Rain and Slanting Wind Still Leave Traces; Quiet Night, a Person Writes a Letter of Severance</p>
<p>Dreams are the hub of nervous sensations. Because the blood vessels concentrate blood flow, illusions and hallucinations are produced. Blood flow is not really a mysterious thing. However, dreamers always suspect that there is a premonition within it, and the more thoughtful a person is, the more likely they are to dream, and the more they treat dreams as a premonition. The dream that Jiang Menglan had that night struck his heart because the thing he couldn't get in reality, he got in the dream. Many people cannot satisfy their desires and rely entirely on dreaming to satisfy them. However, after that moment of satisfaction, it often increases their sadness and indignation. Menglan didn't turn on the light, and stood in the dark room like that. He didn't sigh softly until he heard two distant rooster crows. He went to bed to rest. He woke up a little late the next morning, hurriedly washed his face, and quickly took his schoolbag and went to school. As he walked on the road, he thought to himself that he wouldn't encounter Zhang Guoqi today. The time they usually met on the road had passed. This thought was not like in the past, when he would look ahead early on. This time, he lowered his head and walked step by step. When he walked into that narrow alley, he heard a burst of footsteps. He looked up and couldn't help but take a step back. It was the very person he was thinking of. After their meeting at Yuhua Terrace yesterday, they felt very familiar with each other. It seemed too impolite to just look at each other like this. Therefore, in that intentional or unintentional moment, a shallow smile appeared on his face. It could be said that this smile was not for Zhang Guoqi, because he didn't look directly at Zhang Guoqi. But could it be said that he wasn't smiling at Guoqi? However, there was no one else in this narrow alley. Therefore, although Guoqi couldn't immediately express his gratitude, he deeply understood this gentle and bright smile. Moreover, as they passed each other, it was inconvenient to stop. The time when their eyes met was very short. Even if Guoqi wanted to return the greeting, it was too late. Fortunately, two hours later, when they returned from school, Guoqi would have a way to repay the shallow smile he had received. In order to respond to this shallow smile, he quickly ran towards this alley from school. When he arrived at the entrance of the alley, he didn't see Jiang Menglan, so he didn't dare to walk too fast. Because if he walked too fast and passed two or three alleys, they would separate and wouldn't be able to meet. He walked so slowly, each foot pausing for a minute before moving forward. (35)</p>
<h3>After Reading the Observation Notes on Famous Chinese Paintings</h3>
<p>— Ma Gongyu</p>
<p>My friend Shi Jun, who is skilled in calligraphy and good at painting, is devoted to writing. He has seen many famous paintings. Recently, he wrote "Observation Notes on Famous Chinese Paintings" based on the paintings that China participated in at the London Chinese Art Exhibition. It is more than 90,000 words. He uses vivid and concise language to describe the styles, techniques, and brushwork of more than one hundred famous works from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, a total of one hundred and sixty-eight pieces. He also researches the origins, residences, and ranks of the artists to determine the true merits and demerits. He also critiques and lists the inscriptions and poems. For example, he wrote about Zhao Boju's "Spring Mountain Map": "...Blue and green outlines, meticulous brushstrokes, overlapping peaks and mountains, lush trees, rows of peach and willow trees, mulberry fields and grazing, Zhou Tang small boats, like a paradise, a piece of Jiangnan spring scenery; but the brushwork is immature, unlike Boju, Qian Jiang's inscription said that this frame of spirit and brushwork is consistent with Zhao Boju's true work, that is, the trial is Zhao Boju, etc., which is very incomprehensible! And carefully observe the cattle and horses and bridges in the picture, which are extremely bad, how can it be out of Boju's hand?..." He also commented on Zhao Ziang's "Double River Stacked Mountains Scroll": "...The landscape is ink, the double river is stacked with mountains, quite fortunate the meaning of the mountains and rivers are heavy, but the brushwork is soft and has no changes, the ink color is very lacking in shades, and Yongtan mostly makes pointed heads, which is both complicated and chaotic, like using cooked paper to describe, the interest is flat, and the inscriptions of celebrities of all dynasties are almost everywhere, although not Ziang's outstanding work, it is also a famous work!..." His comments are like this, and each chapter's conclusion can also be summarized and concise; and more than 30 pieces of fine and wonderful products from previous generations are selected and attached with the original image film, which is very sufficient for reference and appreciation. It is really rare in past painting records. It has been printed and published by the Commercial Press. I have the pleasure of seeing it first, so I will state the general outline to tell my friends.</p>
<h3>On the Exquisite Rock</h3>
<p>— Zhu Chengxi</p>
<p>After we reached Yu Mountain and walked west from Vimalakirti Temple, we were tired. The hard work of several days forced me to rest for a while before continuing. So we climbed onto an exquisite rock and looked at the scenery in the distance.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River stretched out to the southeast, its rolling waters shimmering with purple, green, ochre, and other colors in the sunlight. Patches of cloud shadows floated on the water, and the sails looked like white goose feathers. Looking down the mountainside, it was covered with red, purple, and yellow azaleas, with a riot of colors. The lakeside and fields floated on the water in squares, the rape flowers yellow and the wheat green, setting each other off, truly vivid. The wind blew, and the pine forest made a sound of pine waves, mixed with the babbling of the spring water and the singing of partridges, forming a beautiful symphony.</p>
<p>Looking into the distance, the hazy shadow of Wolf Mountain on the other side of the Yangtze River appeared in the smoky air, truly the so-called "spring sunshine and smoky scenery."</p>
<p>After sitting for a while, we regained our spirits and climbed another peak.</p>
<h3>Breaking Bamboo Shoots</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>A few days ago, in my hometown—Taoyuan in western Ningbo—women and girls were busy breaking bamboo shoots again. What they were breaking were "wild mountain bamboo shoots," which anyone could break without spending money. There are many kinds of bamboo shoots in our hometown. For example, mao bamboo shoots, black bamboo shoots, dragon whiskers, white shell baskets...etc., these are all private property. Each bamboo garden is surrounded by fences or low stone walls. No outsiders are allowed to dig up the bamboo shoots inside the fences and walls, otherwise they will be severely punished by the villagers. Only the wild bamboo shoots that grow in the deep mountains and cold canyons, although the mountains each have owners, the bamboo shoots are not considered private property. The kinds of bamboo shoots: the smaller ones are "flower knot full shell bamboo shoots, red shell bamboo shoots, and wild dragon whiskers." The larger ones are yellow mud bamboo shoots and wild mao bamboo shoots. Most of the ones sold in the ordinary market are private products, dug up with hoes, called digging bamboo shoots: the stems of wild mountain bamboo shoots are relatively thin, and can be broken by hand, hence the name breaking bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>Now that farming has started, most farmers are working in the fields, so breaking bamboo shoots is mostly done by women and girls. They decide on several comrades and set off from home in the morning. They walk vigorously into the mountains, bringing ropes and cloth. When they find a place with bamboo leaves, they rush in and break the long and short bamboo shoots, tying them into bundles with ropes. They search vigorously, crossing mountains and ridges like this. Around noon, they are hungry and tired, and they have enough bamboo shoots! Some have thirty or forty pounds, and some have ten or twenty pounds. Everyone wraps and ties them up, and leisurely comes down the mountain and returns home.</p>
<p>Breaking bamboo shoots once can be eaten for three to five days. If they can't finish eating them all at once, they dry the bamboo shoots or pickle them for future use. After ten days or so, they estimate that the second batch of bamboo shoots has grown up, so they invite their comrades and sisters to go again. During a bamboo shoot season, they can do this three times. But the departure date must be calculated accurately. If it is too early, the bamboo shoots have not grown out. If it is too late, they have already been broken by others. It must be just the right time to not make the trip in vain.</p>
<p>The taste of eating bamboo shoots is secondary, the fun of breaking them is especially strong. When I was a child, I also went with my sisters to experience it. When I occasionally recall this, I can't help but feel emotional.</p>
<h3>A Record of What I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Sun Choucheng)</p>
<p>Recently, governments in various places have been paying great attention to the word "respect for the elderly." Newspapers often report on the opening of elderly gatherings in certain provinces and cities, with grand scenes of men over 70 and women over 80 attending. Yesterday, Choucheng passed through Ximen in this city and saw a crowd gathered at the entrance of Dade Lane near the fire station. Upon closer inspection, he saw an old man with a sallow complexion and white hair, wearing a worn-out cotton-padded jacket and holding a tree branch as a walking stick, kneeling on the sidewalk. In front of him was a piece of white paper with the fourteen large characters "Most pitiful, 87-year-old bitter life, lonely and helpless." Below was written, "To the kind people in need, I am from Dingjiaji, Qingjiang. I ran a fragrance shop. Due to the drought in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, I had nothing to say. Later, because I borrowed money from relatives, it was unlucky, and then I was robbed and burned to the ground. I came to Shanghai to seek refuge with relatives, but they looked at me differently and the money ran out due to the drought. After sleeping for half a year, it was all used up. My old wife is already 78 years old and bedridden, her life hanging by a thread. I am already 87 years old, with no sons or daughters, and no one to rely on. I am truly a bitter life. I want to go home, but I have no travel expenses. I want to go, but I can't go. I want to die, but I can't die. Therefore, I, a humble person, beg you, kind people passing by, all great benefactors, and gentlemen from all directions, to have compassion." The writing was not fluent, and the words were very sad. Some passersby threw one or two copper coins. After a while, a patrolling policeman came and told him that this place was obstructing traffic and he couldn't kneel here all the time. He ordered him to move back five steps and kneel inside the alley. To be an old man, and for happiness and bitterness to be so uneven, it is truly worthy of sighing!</p>

<h3>Preface to "Selected Lyrics of Famous Qing Masters"</h3>
<p>— Huang Xiaoshu</p>
<p>In the past, Zhu Jiangcun, a minister, often wanted to select lyrics by Qing Dynasty people for a collection of family lyrics, but he never succeeded due to procrastination. Later, in the year of Gengwu, he began to gather lyricists in Shanghai and advocated the compilation of "Qing Lyrics Copy," sending letters far and wide to search widely. He used Shanghai as the hub. I, along with Xia Chang and Chang Chang, all helped with the matter, and thus had the opportunity to see many lyric collections and understand their origins and schools. Xia Chang also compiled an estimate of the lyricists of the eleven dynasties. There were 188 people in the Shunzhi Dynasty, 117 people in the Kangxi Dynasty, 36 people in the Yongzheng Dynasty, 362 people in the Qianlong Dynasty, 328 people in the Jiaqing Dynasty, 440 people in the Daoguang Dynasty, 202 people in the Xianfeng Dynasty, 110 people in the Tongzhi Dynasty, 178 people in the Guangxu Dynasty, and 132 people in the Xuantong Dynasty. This is only based on the lyric collections seen between Geng and Xin. If we extrapolate, there are still more that were collected later and scattered in various anthologies. How prosperous! It is often said that the rise and fall of literature always depends on politics and education. Although lyrics are a minor art, one cannot reach its peak without accumulated learning, broad knowledge, and extraordinary joy and sorrow. Therefore, its origin stems from poetry, and its ability to move people is as powerful as music. The Qing Dynasty's academic prosperity surpassed the previous Ming Dynasty. During the Kangxi and Qianlong periods, the imperial examination was held twice, and talents emerged in large numbers. Most of the early Qing Dynasty lyricists were scholars, so they could develop and promote the Yuan sound. The prevailing trends gradually formed schools. Jialing vibrated in the Wu area, and Zhu Zhu was famous in Zhejiang. They were both adorned with jewels and treasures, and their qualities were equal. When Zhang Hui and others rose in the Yanghu area during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, they advocated the meaning within and beyond the words, and washed away the old habits of partiality. The world increasingly knew the dignity of the lyric style. Since the Tongzhi era, there have been many wars and foreign troubles. Talented and intelligent people have expressed their worries, sorrows, loyalty, love, and affectionate fragrant feelings in lyrics. The trend has become more prosperous over time. From Jiang Lutan in the distant past to Wang Bantang, Zheng Dahe, and Zhu Jiangcun in the recent past, although each is different from Yanghu, they all have the intention of mourning and devoting their hearts to the family and the country. Even if Ming Ke and other elders were resurrected in the afterlife, they could not help but fear the predecessors and younger generations. Isn't it because of the unique circumstances and unique achievements? By observing this, one can understand the changes in the world and examine the politics and education. The selection of "Qing Lyrics Copy" has already exceeded 4,000 families, but the volumes are numerous and the compilation is pending. Chen Naiqian from Haining recently carved "Selected Lyrics of Famous Qing Masters" and asked for a word. Although its selection of people is not as good as one-eleventh of "Qing Lyrics Copy," the special collections of Qing Dynasty lyricists that are truly worthy of being passed down are roughly prepared here. This is also a collection of works of a generation, and a history of customs. In the past, Song Dynasty lyric collections, such as Changsha's "Hundred Lyricists" and Fujian's "Outer Compilation of Qin Qu," were all completed in bookstores and can be examined. The Song Dynasty lyrics have been read for generations and reappear, and their survival depends on this. Chen Naiqian, in this era of literary decline, cherishes documents and continues the elegant tradition, benefiting the scholar-officials, and his achievements are very great. He should take this as a starting point to collect and publish Qing people's lyric collections as much as possible. In the year of Bingzi, April, Huang Xiaoshu of Changchang wrote in Shanghai's Jilu's Ink Play Garden.</p>
<h3>Preface to "Selected Lyrics of Famous Qing Masters"</h3>
<p>— Chen Naiqian</p>
<p>Lyric writing began in the Tang Dynasty and flourished in the Southern Song Dynasty. By the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, zaju operas arose, and lyric studies gradually declined. During the three hundred years of the Qing Dynasty, the study of scriptures and history was extremely prosperous, surpassing previous dynasties. Lyrics also suddenly revived, and their changes and outlines can be stated. Zhu Zhu and Jialing were born in the early period, reviving and revitalizing, with deep feelings and strong spirit. Fan Xie continued to echo, scrutinizing the sounds and polishing the sentences, tracing the Song Dynasty sages, and initially established the Zhejiang school's portal. However, commentators still regret that he took Jiang Zhang as the limit, biased towards physical things, and the form did not match the meaning. Its latecomers inevitably became fragmented. Therefore, the Kunling two Zhangs separately marked the meaning within and beyond the words, and Jinqing and Zhian developed and promoted it. Bantang rose, and its reality initially corresponded. Those in the countryside who viewed poetry as a minor art were suddenly enlightened to the fact that its industry was firmly on the same track as the interpretation of scriptures and poetry.</p>
<p>The Four Libraries of the Qing Dynasty's comprehensive collection can be described as extremely broad, but only Cao Zhenji's family was collected in the contemporary lyric collection, and only seven people were recorded. Could it be that the talents in the imperial court still regarded poetry as a minor art and despised it? However, the style of poetry flourished in the government and the opposition. Those as noble as Nalan, as rich as Yiyun, and even eccentric scholars often devoted their efforts to this, without hesitation. Among them, the changes and evolution finally reached great success. The works of expressing emotions can only be suppressed to strengthen them, and this cannot be prevented by human power.</p>
<p>Jiangcun's revised compilation was repeatedly proofread later, so there will be no regrets. Mr. Zhao Shuyong from Kunling edited and carved Ming lyrics, and it was more than half finished. However, Qing lyrics, which revived the traditions of the two Songs and became a great power, had no carvings. Isn't it because single volumes and isolated copies were not widely circulated, and book collectors rarely saw records? I have forgotten my poverty and humbly have ambitions for this, and I will proceed with the collection, separately edit the version, and correct it as a supplement. The rules for editing are listed on the left. I hope that the gentlemen of the Hongda family will approve it.</p>
<p>1. There are thousands of Qing Dynasty lyricists. First, one hundred families will be printed. After there is a collection, the second collection will be printed. This is not to say that the famous lyricists of the Qing Dynasty are limited to this.</p>
<p>2. The content of this compilation is all complete lyric collections. If it is only seen in anthologies, or a few lyrics are attached to the back of the poetry collection, and there is no separate collection, it will not be recorded even if it is good.</p>
<p>3. Ming Dynasty remnants, thinking of the old country, should be listed together with the new dynasty's officials, which is in line with the author's original intention. People like Wang Fuzhi and Qu Dajun will generally be cut off.</p>
<p>4. Each person's collection has several carvings. There are many or few episodes, or they are not the same. Now take them to cross-check each other to make a complete copy. For example, Wu Weiye's lyrics are combined with this collection and the family collection of Sun Mo's carvings, and Long Dingzi's lyrics are combined with this collection and Xiang Yan Su San Er Furong's lyrics. Only those who have finalized their own works in their later years will use the finalized version. For example, Wang Pengyun will use Bantang's finalized manuscript, and Zhu Guwei will use Jiangcun's language industry.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of punctuation marks "。" for rhymes "·" for sentences "，" for pauses. However, famous lyricists in the early Qing Dynasty followed the mistakes of Xiaoyu's score, such as the sixteen-character formula, which should now start with one character. Xiaoyu's eight scores quoted "Sleep. The moon shadows penetrate the white window, white jade money." He mistakenly used the word "sleep" for "bright," and then took the three characters "bright moon shadows" as a sentence. The punctuation often does not conform to the law. Now, only the text style is followed. I hope that those who slander will understand.</p>
<p>Chen Naiqian of Haining, first summer of Bingzi</p>
<h3>Preface to "Selected Lyrics of Famous Qing Masters"</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>I have often argued that the Qing Dynasty's scholarship surpassed the Ming Dynasty in several respects, and lyric poetry was one of them. The origins of lyric poetry began in the Tang Dynasty, flourished in the Five Dynasties, reached its peak in the Song Dynasty, and declined in the Ming Dynasty. It was not until the Qing Dynasty that it revived. Zhu and Chen guided its flow, and Shen and Li shook its waves. Zhang and Zhang occasionally talked about respecting its style, and Wang, Wen, Zheng, and Zhu continued its legacy. Talented people emerged in large numbers during the two hundred and eighty years, creating different tunes and sharing the same work, and the novelty led to differences. Even after the change of dynasties, the beautiful clouds remained. Most of today's authors are still under the influence of the Tongguang and Xuan masters. This cannot but be called a great success. However, the scattered flow of chapters and volumes needs to be reviewed and connected by wise men. For the past hundred years, there have been collections based on regional prestige, such as the Yuexi lyrics and the Huzhou lyrics records; collections based on sound and spirit, such as the Wei Province's Tong Sheng Ji and the Tijing Ji; and collections based on categories, such as the Minxiu Lyrics Copy and the Hundred Flowers Poetry Remnants. Some collections are rich in range but have not been selected, or the virtue of holding is not grand and the scale is relatively narrow. The method of collecting flowers and selecting beauty has not yet been achieved. I once edited the Qing Lyrics Copy, wanting to collect all the Qing Dynasty lyrics and select the best ones for recording. After five years of management, more than five thousand families were collected, and the work was done with caution, but it has not yet been completed. I also wanted to select the best of them as the Sixty Lyricists of Qing Dynasty, limited to those who have a definite origin and can establish their own portals. But the matter was not completed. Mr. Chen Naiqian of Haining, who inherited learning and loved the ancient, is the Jigu Pavilion of Jigu Pavilion and Zhidaozhai. Recently, he published the Qing lyrics he collected, intending to print and spread them widely, starting with a hundred families as a collection. The masters of the lyrics are roughly preserved, and the grand rules of a generation and the documents of a century are preserved, which is almost the same as what I intended. The younger generation is to be feared, and I will take the lead. When this book comes out, I will almost want to burn my pen and look at it. At this moment, the family of voices are competing and all factions are contending. I have always held the theory of adaptation, saying that in the future, new styles of songs will be created to respond to the times. However, the style and system must be inherited in order to transform, and the sincerity of the heart, the meaning, and the skills, from the inside to the outside, cannot be shaken over time. Scholars who want to know the changes and changes of this path for more than two hundred years in order to be able to obtain a teacher by themselves, then this book is in charge of its discussion. This is the preface. June of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Ye Gongchuo of Panyu.</p>
<h3>"Selected Famous Words of Qing Dynasty" Sample Sheet Fengxiang Word</h3>
<p>— Song Luo Muzhong of Shangqiu</p>
<p>Tianxiang Longxianxiang</p>
<p>The island coils around the sand and the smoke embraces the moon. The potential dragon spits froth like this, collected from the silk palace and dripping like dew. Thousands of miles of floating difference, who takes it? A small test of Boshan seems to cut off a wisp of British yarn with fast scissors. Fluttering and brushing the seat, I look at the sea and sky, where? The most pity is that the empty boudoir is lit alone, facing the hazy Yanliang 　 Hu, leaning on Yin Chou, listening to the deep night plum rain. At this time, the longing is not shallow. I sigh that if the romance is suddenly not the original, I am always wrapped around the remnant of the scent.</p>
<p>Water Dragon Yin White Lotus</p>
<p>The silver pond dances with a field of fish. The beautiful new makeup of Li Yun is held out. The light is light, and it quietly peeks into the rapids. The fluttering emerald feathers lower the sky, and the slanting pressure on the branches is particularly clear. Xiang Fei stands alone, light silk reflects the bright dangling. The wave light shines brightly. Thirty-six acres of vastness, gradually twilight. Bingzi is so quiet. It is suitable to open the jade well. If you fold it, you should cry out in the hands of Suxue. All the red capitals are swept away. The dew is cold and the incense is cold. The moon is bright and shadowless. Flowers and old people face the Hezhou Qian Duo Kan Cheng Xue Fu Xiang Zou Mei Dao Zhou is in Liang Tuan. 即邹枚赋处</p>

<p>Health</p>
<h3>Enteritis</h3>
<p>Enteritis is a common summer ailment. It is caused by the ingestion of spoiled food, which irritates the intestinal mucosa. Symptoms: diarrhea two or three times a day, or even thirty or forty times. Intestinal rumbling, abdominal pain, elevated body temperature, and general fatigue. Treatment: A small amount of laxative should be taken, and diarrhea should not be stopped. Stopping diarrhea will instead cause bacteria to multiply rapidly in the intestines, worsening the condition. At the same time, a digestive aid should be taken to help intestinal function. The "Strong Stomach Essence" medicine is most suitable for the gastrointestinal tract due to its ingredients, so it can be used as an intestinal disinfectant. As a result, diarrhea, abdominal pain, etc., can be relieved and health restored.</p>
<h3>Effective Treatment for Lung Disease</h3>
<p>The prevalence of lung disease has been a long-standing issue, intensifying in modern times. Humans are often infected in early childhood, and by adulthood, approximately nine out of ten individuals have been exposed. While those affected may generally maintain their health, tuberculosis bacteria lie dormant within the body. However, with the slightest carelessness, such as overexertion or insufficient nutrition leading to weakened immunity, these bacteria seize the opportunity to erupt, unleashing their fierce power, resulting in lung disease. Since Dr. Koch discovered the causative agent of this disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nearly everyone recognizes lung disease as an extremely dangerous infectious illness. Consequently, there is no absolutely effective cure, and particularly with oral medications, reliably successful treatments are scarce. Recently, the calcium-based preparation "Pulmonal" has undergone extensive expert evaluation, and it is widely acknowledged to have demonstrated genuine effectiveness, purportedly reaching the true essence of tuberculosis treatment. Moreover, it is an absolutely sterile oral medication. Rigorous animal testing has shown that this product is entirely non-toxic and free from any side effects. Suitable for both new and chronic lung disease sufferers, regardless of physical weakness, age (old or young), its indications include cough, shortness of breath, vague chest pain, thick or thin phlegm, loss of appetite, night sweats, fever, etc. Due to the inclusion of calcium and other precious restorative ingredients, it can rapidly stop hemoptysis and bloody sputum. Furthermore, this agent is applicable to all respiratory ailments, such as bronchitis (chronic cough with persistent phlegm), asthma, pediatric pertussis, common cold with cough and phlegm, etc., yielding remarkable efficacy. A complete and fundamental recovery can confidently be expected within one month. However, if the patient also suffers from neurasthenia, anemia, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, seminal emission in men, or menstrual irregularities in women, in addition to taking this preparation, they may simultaneously take "Body-Strengthening Kang" for men to treat seminal emission and "Female-Beauty Supplement" for women to regulate menstruation. This can achieve vigorous strength, abundant qi and blood, increased body weight, and overall satisfying results.</p>
<h3>Exceptional Remedy for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Treating gonorrhea, based on past experience, is indeed an extremely challenging task. Achieving temporary relief is not difficult, but securing a permanent cure is not easy. Although transmucosal sterilization therapy is widely recognized by scholars, it is not absolute. This is because the initial infection of gonorrhea bacteria resides in the mucous membrane, and as it later lies dormant and infiltrates deeper, entering the posterior urethra or spreading to other parts of the body, this type of therapy becomes powerless. Therefore, transmucosal sterilization is only relatively effective for acute cases. Recently, the medical community has been promoting leukocyte augmentation therapy (Lencocyto-sentherapie) as highly effective against gonorrhea, as it increases the number of leukocytes in the blood, resulting in a potent systemic anti-toxic and sterilizing action, thus eradicating the gonorrhea bacteria. The French Pharmacy, based on this latest and unique scientific principle, extracts special ingredients such as protein bodies under special operations to create the gonorrhea remedy "Klinon." After administration, it can reliably increase the number of blood cells dramatically, rapidly activating the phagocytic function, thus clearing away gonorrhea bacteria wherever they may be hidden. Therefore, male and female patients with acute or chronic gonorrhea, as well as complications such as orchitis, prostatitis, arthritis, etc., can achieve complete recovery and thorough cure by taking this medicine. Moreover, the medicinal properties are pure and benign, without any drawbacks, unlike common medicines. Therefore, when purchasing, be sure not to mistakenly believe others' exaggerations and be misled into buying cheap, miscellaneous, and inferior medicines, which may cause stomach problems or even endanger life after taking them. Therefore, be sure to pay attention to recognizing the three characters "Klinon" for a reliable and effective result. According to research in various European countries, since the introduction of this drug, the number of gonorrhea cases has decreased by 80% in one year, and after being cured by this medicine, everything can return to normal, with no risk of recurrence.</p>
<h3>Hot Weather! Leukorrhea is Even More Annoying!</h3>
<p>Leukorrhea is more annoying whenever it is hot. Because all liquids evaporate most easily in the summer, the disease of leukorrhea is usually disgusting and repulsive, but when it comes to hot weather, sweat and vaginal discharge combine to produce a peculiar and unpleasant odor. As a result, the erosion of the patient is deeper, the vagina is stinging, and urination is also unpleasant. It can often cause menstrual difficulties and is a major cause of infertility.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of this disease, general well-known doctors often use "Carolschidi Vaginal Tablets" as a suppository, inserting one tablet deep into the vagina every night and washing it off the next morning. Apply as directed, and leukorrhea can be completely removed, inflammation can be reduced, pain can be relieved, and the wound can be completely healed within three or four weeks. However, for those infected by a husband's gonorrhea, "Klinon" can be taken internally to eliminate the internal gonorrhea toxin. For leukorrhea caused by physical weakness and underdevelopment, "Female-Beauty Supplement" can be taken internally to strengthen the body and adjust menstruation, taking both sides into consideration. Therefore, the effect is even faster.</p>
<h3>Treatment for the Cause of Weak Reproductive Power</h3>
<p>Excellent Remedy for Vigorous Endocrine Function</p>
<p>Although civilization is making progress day by day, the human race is degenerating day by day, and the physique is becoming weaker day by day. The sorrow of the patients is even more unspeakable. This is because modern sexually transmitted diseases are becoming more and more rampant. Young people lack sex education and have always grown up in the charming cities of luxury and dissipation. The decline of sexual morality is deepening day by day. As a result, their reproductive power is becoming weaker and more pitiful, and they often have suicidal thoughts. Generally speaking, the robustness of our physique and the vigor of our reproductive power all depend on the vigorous endocrine function. For example, the low endocrine function of our reproductive glands can lead to incomplete reproductive development, seminal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, irregular menstruation in women, etc. Human happiness is also cut off because of this.</p>
<p>Mr. Meilun, in view of the pitifulness of this trend, worked hard to research and developed two medicines, "Body-Strengthening Kang" for men and "Female-Beauty Supplement" for women. All raw materials are extracted from the testicles and ovaries of young and strong animals, and hormones are extracted separately, and then combined with the latest scientific methods. For both men and women with weak reproductive power, such as men with consumption and tuberculosis, thin semen, weak erection, women with irregular menstruation, and slow sensation, therefore, both sexes must be very fragile in reproductive power and often suffer from the pain of infertility after a long marriage. If men take "Body-Strengthening Kang" and women take "Female-Beauty Supplement", they can reorganize and reorganize the reproductive system in the shortest period of time, and the endocrine function will be vigorous, so that they can still restore their original youthful ability. Therefore, these two medicines are effective agents to save the weakness of human reproductive power and are not comparable to ordinary hormone preparations.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Medicine Praised by Everyone</h3>
<p>Gonorrhea is the most difficult to deal with, and gonorrhea medicine is the most difficult to choose. The research on this medicine in various countries in the world is very enthusiastic, but in terms of its achievements, none has surpassed "Klinon". This medicine has been tested by major doctors and is indeed made of high-priced products that purely kill gonorrhea bacteria and increase the body's anti-toxic power. Therefore, after taking it, it can directly exert its bactericidal power in the mucosal part in the shortest period of time, and it can also vigorously promote the elements of the whole body that resist gonorrhea toxin. Therefore, although it has a strong bactericidal power, it has no bad side effects. It is because the quality is refined and pure and the coordination is appropriate, which is not comparable to other crude people. No wonder famous doctors in various countries in the world also use it.</p>
<p>This medicine is effective in various stages of gonorrhea, such as acute stage, chronic stage, and complications seen in each stage, such as anterior and posterior urethritis, prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, arthritis, and years of vaginal stenosis, etc., all showing anti-inflammatory, analgesic, diuretic, and turbidity-clearing effects within a few weeks.</p>
<p>According to recent reports from patients in various places, everyone praises the great efficacy of "Klinon", those with mild symptoms are cured within two or three weeks, and those with severe symptoms are also able to achieve miraculous results within four or five weeks. Its success rate is about 97% to 98%, exceeding the highest results of gonorrhea drugs in various countries in the world. However, be sure to recognize the three characters "Klinon" when purchasing, so as not to be mistaken. Do not listen to the words of others and buy miscellaneous and cheap inferior drugs to avoid danger.</p>
<h3>The Dangerous Symptoms of Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>The symptoms of stomach pain are generally hidden pain, fullness in the chest, gradually becoming burning or stinging, spasmodic pain, or originating from the chest, or involving the back, or radiating to the lower abdomen. If it develops to a high degree, it will always be unconscious. Become a dangerous symptom! But its inducing factors are also transformed from chronic stomach disease. Therefore, if we have stomach disease, we should treat it as soon as possible. Also, ulcers of the stomach and duodenum, pyloric spasm, congestion of liver blood vessels, arteriosclerosis of the gastric artery, hiatal hernia, etc. are all causes of this disease.</p>
<p>For treatment, take a small amount of red wine and apply a hot water bag or warm wet cloth to the stomach. This is a symptomatic treatment. For a radical cure, the weakened function of the stomach must be thoroughly transformed, its cellular action activated, and its nerves soothed, then the stomach pain will be eliminated and its normal state will be restored. "Strong Stomach Essence" has these wonderful functions. This agent is the best of stomach medicines. Europeans have long appreciated it.

Because this product is a yeast preparation and contains three important components of vitamins A, B, and D, it is a good medicine for beriberi with a unique approach. Its supply of nutrition is more than enough. The difference between this medicine and other medicines is that it has the nutrient source of a yeast that other medicines do not have, so it has better effects and is a rare and precious tonic.</p>
<h3>Rare News About Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>Suffering from Chronic Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhou Shichen, who suffered from gonorrhea for many years, with sperm turbidity, dribbling urine, and blood in the urine, said that the right example of testicular stinging pain made it difficult to walk. After repeated medical treatments, the effect was completely ineffective. Later, Mr. Wang introduced him to purchase and take "Klinon". After taking it for less than three weeks, the symptoms improved. All the symptoms, such as orchitis and stinging pain during urination, had been reduced by 60% to 70%. He continued to take "Klinon" until the end of the second week. He recovered completely, walked as usual, and after five or six blood tests, there was no recurrence of gonorrhea toxin, which confirmed that it was cured.</p>
<p>Husband's Toxin</p>
<p>Patient Madam Fan Taixuan, because her husband had gonorrhea, she was also infected by him soon after. The vagina was filled with foul liquid all day long, and it was eroded beyond recognition. Urination was difficult, and the lower abdomen was swollen and uncomfortable. Later, because Mr. Fan was cured after taking "Klinon", she also purchased several bottles of "Klinon" and took it for about four weeks. She stopped having leukorrhea and had been cured of her many years of leukorrhea. The couple was very happy and praised the efficacy of the two medicines.</p>
<p>Bladder Inflammation</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lin Shiyang, who was first infected with gonorrhea, later developed severe exercise and suddenly turned into bladder inflammation. The body temperature rose, and the urine was unusually turbid, with a lot of sediment. He shouted all night, suffering unbearable pain. Then he purchased and took less than five bottles of "Klinon". The inflammation was greatly reduced, urination was smooth, and the disease was cured.</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Mr. He Fangxiong stepped into the flower industry after a banquet one evening. After returning, he developed seminal vesiculitis because he took "Klinon" for three weeks and was cured. Not only did he ask about it for the second time, but he also suddenly developed seminal vesiculitis, not only was gonorrhea still flowing, and urination was painful, but he also had nocturnal emission every night, and his spirit was unusually sluggish. Then he still sent someone to various pharmacies to purchase and take "Klinon". Fortunately, the effect was immediately apparent after taking it, and the pain was not as severe as before.

<h3>I Have Another Hope</h3>
<p>— Respectfully</p>
<p>The First Hope is to Eliminate the Civil War. The Second Hope is to Cooperate Fully.</p>
<p>A few days ago, there was a sudden rumor that there were changes in the troops in Guangdong and Guangxi. At first, I definitely did not recognize that this was a fact. It must be a rumor created by speculators in the exchange, or propaganda by someone who hoped for civil strife in our country. Unexpectedly, on the sixth of this month, the newspapers could not cover it up. The major newspapers wrote a lot about the Guangdong and Guangxi troops entering Hunan. After the Guangxi army was stationed in Yongzhou, two more divisions arrived in Chenzhou. Two planes from Guangdong landed in Hengyang and other bad news. I understood that this was true and could not help but break out in a cold sweat. Because I agreed with the purpose of the Guangdong and Guangxi troops sending troops, but I did not agree with their separate actions without working together with the Central Government. Moreover, not only could they not work together, but they started a civil war first, which I extremely opposed. Because the day when civil war begins in our country is the day when our country will be destroyed, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>Strong neighbors are watching us intently, hoping that something will happen to our country, and fearing that nothing will happen to our country. Therefore, they do not hesitate to fabricate various rumors, incite local troops, destroy the entire country, and reap the benefits of being a fisherman. The so-called ingenious plan of using Chinese to control Chinese has long been known to passers-by. If the southern authorities disregard everything, act entirely on impulse, first burn the beanstalk to cook the beans, and then forget the disaster of biting the navel, and regard the country as a lonely gamble, and treat compatriots as enemies, even infants may not be willing to take this unwise move. Fortunately, recently, thanks to the appeals from all parties, letters and telegrams flew back and forth, and the voices were hoarse, and the southern authorities had been understood. The newspaper reported the day before yesterday that Chen Jitang had ordered the troops in front to stop advancing and advised Li and Bai to order the Guangxi troops entering Hunan to stop proceeding and wait for the central government to resolve the matter. Yesterday, the newspaper reported that Guangdong and Guangxi had withdrawn their troops that had arrived in Yongzhou. This kind of news is extremely hoped for by the people of our country. In this situation of panic and dense war clouds, it suddenly disappeared in a few days, and the fierce atmosphere was completely eliminated. First, I cannot but admire President Chiang's magnanimity and order the central troops in front to move backward and not resist. Second, I cannot but admire the southern generals for stating the great righteousness and following the good advice. In a few days, they gradually withdrew the advancing troops. This attitude of both parties being loyal to the country, removing personal impulses, and being open and aboveboard is what I originally hoped for.</p>
<p>The second hope is that although this war has been eliminated, the opinions of both parties may not have been fully compromised. We further hope that the authorities of both parties will eliminate prejudice, be open and honest, and work together to relieve the national crisis. In the situation of sharing the same boat, we should be aware of the warning of the lips being gone and the teeth being cold. Brothers quarreling within the walls, defending against insults from outside, the teachings are clear and can be learned from. Now that the Second Plenary Session is about to open, we eagerly hope that the southern authorities will send senior officials to the meeting as soon as possible to discuss the matter at length and cooperate fully, so that the internal troubles have been eliminated and the external disasters can also be resolved. This is also what our people eagerly expect.</p>
<h3>Night</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhiming</p>
<p>When I was a child, I was most afraid of the night. As soon as it got dark, I didn't dare to leave my family even one step. However, the houses in the countryside were both wide and large. The area illuminated by a kerosene lamp was only a circle nearby, and the shadow of a person projected on the wall was particularly large. If that shadow accidentally transformed into a terrifying shape in my eyes, I would cover my eyes with my palms and shout loudly. My mother had no way to cure my timidity. She always wanted me to go to bed early every day, because she had many things to do under the lamp at night, and I often disturbed her and couldn't feel at ease.</p>
<p>Speaking of my timidity, there is also a reason. At one time, my brother often twisted my grandmother to tell stories. Those stories were all about terrible zombies and legends of tigers eating people. In fact, we were all afraid of hearing such stories, but that kind of unexpected plot aroused our interest more than the stupid son-in-law specially told by our cook. Therefore, in a contradictory state of being afraid to hear and liking to hear, I dragged my mother and my brother dragged the maid and listened to that kind of story. Later, my grandmother died, but the terrifying images still remained in my mind and refused to dissipate, and instead became thicker: seeing an enlarged shadow would make me think of it as the incarnation of a zombie; hearing a little sound would make me think of a tiger crawling on the window. So I was most afraid of the night.</p>
<p>My father ran a shop in the town and lived at home for at most three or four days a month. After my brother and I graduated from elementary school, because of our different personalities, my brother continued his studies, and I helped my father's shop. His intention was that we could receive the effects of both parties by being close to our personalities. But when my brother went to the county town to go to middle school, and I went to my father's shop in the town to help, there were only my mother and a maid at home. The customs in the countryside always felt that it was not very appropriate for a man to be missing from the home. At first, my father wanted to go home every day, but my mother thought that my father was old, busy with shop affairs during the day, and it would be too hard to run so many roads home at night. After discussion, I lived at home. Although the shops in the town closed very early, after eating dinner and settling the accounts, it was about to be the first watch. When the moonlight was good, I could go home by the moon. Usually, I carried a lantern from the shop and groped my way home in the dim light.</p>
<p>Walking at night was really a difficult hurdle for me. The terrifying images that had been lurking since I was a child seemed to be active around me at that time. When the moonlight was good, looking at the black shadow in front of me, I would imagine that there was a strong man lying in ambush there (because my knowledge told me that there would be no zombies and tigers). He would suddenly jump out like a hound when I got closer. As for how that strong man would deal with me, or why he would block my way, I wouldn't think about it. It was even more terrifying when it was dark, because I couldn't see the surroundings. When I heard the sound of wind blowing and grass moving, I thought someone was following behind me, and my imagination was particularly rich. I didn't even dare to pay attention to the lantern I was carrying. I always broke out in a sweat when I got home.</p>
<p>A few months passed, and I got used to walking at night. Since I had to walk that section of road every day, imagination reduced its fear. Gradually, it became a habit. Although I inevitably had to deceive myself sometimes, another thought would immediately follow: if I really encountered any danger, let's see how he would deal with me. I remember once, a watchman was dozing off under a tree. Looking from a distance, when I recognized that it was a tired person crouching, I deliberately carried the lantern to shine clearly under the root of the tree: the watchman was awakened by the light in his sleep, thinking that something dangerous had happened, and jumped out violently. The situation was probably similar to when I was suspicious.</p>
<p>Now I live in the city and encounter nightlife almost every day. The night in the city is so bright. The neon lights on the tall buildings decorate the night into a beautiful world. My bedroom is close to the city center. Opening the window, I won't think of the sky covered by the black curtain of night, just like during the day. Even if I take a rickshaw home at midnight, the street lights and advertising lights on the road are always on all night. The snack shops on both sides are scraping the pots loudly, and the songs from the radio are still being sent from every building window.</p>
<p>Although I sometimes doze off in the rickshaw, I don't think about the night. Night has already become a part of my lifestyle, and the city is originally called a city that never sleeps. (One of the scattered notes from Rongchuang)</p>
<h3>An Investigation into the Lives of Silkworm Farmers</h3>
<p>— Fang Xian</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from This Newspaper</p>
<p>A single season of silkworm farming is a major undertaking for rural communities, second only to rice cultivation. Farmers depend on this season's income to cover winter expenses, various levies and taxes, and living costs before the autumn harvest. In the past, farmers even had the opportunity to prosper from silkworm rearing. However, in recent years, the Chinese silk market has been seized by foreign powers, and artificial silk has flooded the market. As a result, silk prices have plummeted, and the cocoon market has been in a perpetual slump.</p>
<p>Now is the time when silkworm farmers in various regions hope to reap their annual harvest. In order to understand the living conditions of silkworm farmers, I made a special trip to the countryside. Here, I would like to briefly write down my impressions. However, the central location for this investigation is Xishan in Dongting, which is known for its silk cocoon production. However, I dare say that although this is limited to a single area, the situation reflects the common plight of silkworm farmers throughout the Jiangnan region.</p>
<p>In this rural area of over a hundred square miles, every household must raise silkworms. In the past, when raising local varieties, they only raised silkworms twice a year—spring silkworms and summer silkworms. However, after switching to improved varieties, they now raise silkworms three or four times a year—in addition to spring and summer, there are also autumn and winter silkworms. Previously, the local varieties were mostly self-produced or purchased from Xinshi, Yuhang, or Taihu. The price of the silkworm eggs depended on the price of cocoons and the quantity of goods. However, a few years ago, several cocoon merchants established a Silkworm Improvement Guidance Center. The Silkworm Improvement Guidance Center distributed silkworm eggs to various rural households in its name. The price of the eggs was not collected at the time but was deducted at an 80% discount when the cocoons were sold. However, they have recently changed their policy, and the sellers are now a few influential individuals. Villagers who want to raise improved varieties must first register with them the year before and pay the full price of the eggs (four dimes per sheet) in advance. The following year, they can collect the eggs upon presentation of their registration certificate after Qingming. However, the egg cards are not uniform, and the quality varies depending on the relationship between the farmer and the egg sellers, and their "luck." However, it is said that this year, many people who paid for the eggs did not receive them. However, the villagers, intimidated by the power of these individuals, only dare to be angry but not speak out.</p>
<p>In terms of rearing, there are two types: self-rearing and communal rearing. Self-rearing involves taking the eggs and hatching them yourself. Communal rearing is where the egg sellers hatch the eggs and raise them until the first molt, when the farmers take them back. However, in addition to supplying mulberry leaves yourself, communal rearing also requires paying the egg sellers a rearing fee of six to eight dimes per sheet—elsewhere, the fee is three dimes per sheet, but here it is six to eight dimes.</p>
<p>Taking this year's situation as an example, each sheet of improved eggs can yield fifteen catties of silkworms at the peak of their first molt, requiring over three hundred catties of leaves. However, even with a full harvest, each sheet of eggs produces only about thirty catties of cocoons. At the current market price of thirty yuan per picul (market catty)!—the local improved varieties are thirty yuan per hundred market catties this year, while the local varieties are twenty yuan—the income is only nine yuan. Setting aside the fact that the silkworms eat their own mulberry leaves, those who buy leaves to feed their silkworms are losing money. This is because the price of green mulberry leaves this year is at least two yuan per hundred catties at the lowest, and at the highest, it is more than three yuan per hundred catties, and there is nowhere to buy them. Each sheet of eggs requires eight or nine yuan just for mulberry leaves, not including the miscellaneous expenses such as rice straw, charcoal, paper, oil, and labor.</p>
<p>It is said that there are three reasons for the high price of leaves this year. First, because silkworm farmers have lost money from silkworm rearing in recent years, some have cut down their mulberry trees and planted fruit trees instead, resulting in a year-on-year decrease in mulberry leaves. Second, the weather and climate this year are abnormal, and the yield of mulberry leaves is not good. Third, the price of autumn and winter cocoons last year suddenly rose to fifty-some yuan, so silkworm farmers generally believed that the price of cocoons this year would not be too low. As a result, those who raised one or two sheets in previous years increased to three or four sheets this year, and some even raised more than ten sheets. As a result, with everyone raising more, there is a natural shortage of mulberry leaves. Considering the above three reasons, the high price of leaves is a logical outcome.</p>
<p>The cocoon market here has always been controlled by a few local despots. Although there are more than ten cocoon firms, their organization and actions seem to be uniformly coordinated. Even though silkworm farmers know that they are being exploited, what can they do to escape their grasp?</p>
<p>Speaking of the manipulation of the cocoon market, many people have told me about the behind-the-scenes situation in the cocoon firms. They say that the cocoon firms originally took a 10% commission for collecting cocoons. However, in order to please the cocoon merchants and increase their commissions, they exploit the silkworm farmers as much as possible. In the past, the cocoon firms used "large" scales (eighteen taels in Suzhou, sixteen taels in Wuxi, and thirty-two taels in Huzhou, while here it was a twenty-tael scale). Since the implementation of the new measurement system, although the market scale has been changed here, the cocoon farmers weigh a full picul (thirty catties) and take it to the cocoon firm, but they are always shorted at least one to one and a half catties when the cocoon firm weighs it. Moreover, when the cocoons are poured from the cocoon farmer's basket into their large bamboo basket, and after they handle them, some become moldy and shriveled. At that time, they do not calculate according to the market price and weight but simply shout out a number: eight yuan, eight and a half yuan. The silkworm farmers call out "Sir" hundreds of times and plead for a long time. Sometimes, they might be lucky enough to get an extra two or three dimes, but sometimes they are ignored or told impatiently:</p>
<p>"Go! Go! If you don't sell, take it back!" If the cocoon farmer really takes it back, wanting to take it to another firm to sell for a little more, then not only will they not sell it for more, but they might even get a heavier blow, because the firms are all in cahoots. Their treatment will certainly not be different. It is pitiful to hope to sell for a few more cents, because the cocoons have already been handled once and the "color" of the sale has already been set, and it is almost more pitiful than begging.</p>
<p>However, this situation cannot be generalized. The weighers hired by those firms are all local ruffians and scoundrels. Naturally, they have no real experience, and there are bound to be endless abuses. Although the cocoon firm authorities and cocoon merchants know this, they have no choice because they are "local figures." Needless to say, the ones who suffer are still the silkworm farmers!</p>
<p>The disparity in cocoon prices is clearly unfair. This year, the purchase price of improved varieties in Suzhou is more than thirty yuan per hundred market catties, with the highest in Wuxi being forty yuan, and other places being thirty to forty yuan. However, here it has always been only about thirty yuan.—This year's cocoon production is about ten thousand piculs.</p>
<p>The silkworm farmers' year-long hopes, and more than a month of hard work with reduced food and sleep, are exchanged for a long string of disappointments! Those who harvest cocoons also lose money, and those who do not harvest cocoons end up with more debt. But the empty debts, levies, taxes, and living expenses... these are all heavily weighing on their hearts!</p>
<h3>A Small Scene of Life</h3>
<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>Almost every day is like this, I live in contradiction. I need rest, but I cannot rest. Every day, I always finish the things that need to be done within my duties before coming home. After coming home, I go to sleep. Seeing that my body cannot hold up, I do not have the courage to run out of the crowd and rest for a while. I look in the mirror: "Maintain your health!" sincere advice. However, the words of the first person rang in my ears again: "We are not celebrities, we have no time to rest, use all our energy to create a cultural rest park, then everyone can fully rest." Therefore, I am constantly working. I hold on to the present with one hand, and push him with the other, so that he can enter a new realm.</p>
<p>"Sir, your rent is overdue..."</p>
<p>"Sir, if you don't pay your meal money, we won't include it..."</p>
<p>I looked at those faces without any affection, and felt indescribably uncomfortable. I had no choice but to push it off, telling them a date. Although I knew very well that there was no way to do it that day either. Later, I had to come home very late, walk up the stairs lightly, and open my door gently. I went out again early the next morning. But when I came back on the third day, unexpectedly they were not asleep. As soon as they saw me walking up the stairs, their faces were so gloomy, a dark shadow covered their souls. I couldn't say a word to this situation: What to do? Keep owing it? No, I can't do that!—</p>
<p>"Boss, I know this is not right, but... the money from home will be sent in the next two days, I will definitely pay you back..."</p>
<p>Today is another day. However, I have no money to give him. Friends are so poor that they don't have any spare money. The family still hopes that I can send two back, where is the money to send? I have no choice but to come back late every night, like an abandoned cigarette butt burning alone. I still want to use this little flame to light up the torch of life and walk towards that "cultural garden."</p>
<p>But the iron face of life in front of me makes my timid heart tremble a little...</p>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
<p>— Shu Mang</p>
<p>The dim light shines in the dark room of the office. There is no wind, no sunlight, everything is so terribly gloomy. Whether it is the bright day or the dim night, the gray-black table is always covered with that ray of withered yellow light with a tinge of green from the desk lamp, dim, weak, and gloomy, like a ghost fire that has lost its vitality. And those people, pale, thin, each face carrying the same misery, boredom, and exhaustion, silently burying all their youth, reverie, and joy of life there. In the morning, the sun shines vigorously and brightly on the street, and people wake up from the nightmare of the night. As you suddenly walk through the piercing sunlight, you docilely drill into that dark basement-like place. There, paper books and ledgers are piled up heavily, the dim yellow and weak sunlight pitifully pouring in from the narrow windows, dust floating densely inside, looking like a stream of water. So, people pick up their pens, writing, calculating, hoping, the laughter of youth has passed, the enthusiasm of adulthood has also passed, what remains is a withered figure, and paired with this figure is a pair of withered, myopic, terrifying, empty, nothing-left eyes.</p>
<p>——That is career, that is work, that is life, that is... ah!</p>
<p>Wearing the fatigue, depression, and vagueness of a thirty-year-old, Hui Sheng angrily put down the "oolong tea" that had become hot in the tight grip of his fingers, raised his head, and felt a burst of dizziness. Some vague, green, yellow... miscellaneous auras floated in front of him, and his heart was so uncomfortable that he felt like vomiting. Then, a breath rushed up, and he coughed repeatedly. The sound floated shrilly in the air, unpleasantly ringing. The fat, Western-dressed second-class clerk sitting opposite Hui Sheng glanced at him disgustedly, then put on a sympathetic, pitying look, frowned, and began to speak didactically:</p>
<p>"I think, Secretary Wang, you should take a long vacation and go back to rest? Such hard work is not good for you. You are still young, your health is important, as for... as for..." He wanted to say "as for money... as for life..." but he felt that these were too difficult to say, too difficult to make sound good, so he unnaturally stopped his words, and looked at the pale and terrible face sitting opposite him with a sincere look, as if eager to get an answer.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter... it's just a cold, a bit of a cough... Yes, things are hard, things... but the higher-ups always know, it's always good to have someone promote you. If you get someone's promotion, then everything will be a little better..."</p>
<p>The man cast a contemptuous glance, then laughed loudly "Hahahaha". The laughter painfully stung in Hui Sheng's ears, he felt a little! Four years, at the age of twenty-seven, he finally managed to get such a position through friends and relatives: as a copyist, twenty-five yuan salary, food and accommodation at his own expense... Under such conditions, he still had to support a family of four. However, "people have to rely on others to promote them!" Four years, still twenty-five yuan, still "Secretary Wang", still respectfully saluting the bald-headed section chief. These, all exist vaguely. "Promotion" is important, like Little Li, who came two years later than him, didn't he get promoted to second-class clerk last month? However... people say that Little Li has a sister who is on good terms with the section chief... in that way, people get "promoted". And myself...</p>
<p>Hope is as dark and vague as the light on the table, and the body is getting worse day by day, how long will this day last?…</p>
<p>The door was pushed open, revealing a bald head and a pair of black-rimmed glasses, so, habitually, "Secretary Wang" stood up respectfully again…</p>
