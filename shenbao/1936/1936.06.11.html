<p>時評</p>
<h3>兩廣當局何以釋國人之疑慮</h3>
<p>— 禮</p>
<p>兩廣異動消息由日本通訊社有意的張大宣揚一週以來已集中國人之殷憂與疑慮夫當華北局勢緊張中央力謀應付之際突然舉幟陳兵縱聲言對外抗戰而共戎馬所驅實在國內腹地吾人固不信今中國猶有甘冒不韙舍團結禦侮之途懷異謀以速禍患之人惟情報紛陳殷憂與疑慮不能自已爰舉數端以質兩廣當局</p>
<p>第一何以避免內爭？兩廣軍隊揭櫫對外抗戰不先恊商分路進駐湘省之梆永二要地并繼續北展夫國家軍隊各有防地非奉最高軍令不得擅移或放棄防守責任此爲定則倘湘省駐軍不放棄其防守責任時衝突發生誰負其責？夫團結禦侮不作內爭已成公論有達之者公論必予制裁兩廣當局諒熟知之而由彼之道冒昧前進前途阻碍又所必有在如此情勢中其何以避免借抗外以作內爭之譏乎？</p>
<p>第二何以釋某種背境之疑？日來消息所播有謂桂軍中多日籍軍官軍械仰給日本者有謂粵桂向日借欵者有謂兩廣代表近日赴長春者假使兩廣當局未能以眞相昭示國人則國人必疑其行爲與所倡言之內容適得其反夫救國行動必賴衆信共助始克成功未有羣疑滿腹而不致敗事者解釋羣疑其道何由？</p>
<p>第三何以防止國家更進一層之危機？近日外報言論有指兩廣之倡言及行動爲無政治責任心因而將益增加中國之危險者依事而論單獨行動已破壞軍事之統一設更引起內部問題必毀損國力予日人以華北發展之機會則將使北方趨於無術挽救之地步而日人之乘機加重侵略前途關係尤鉅兩廣當局倘就國家艱難之環境詳加考慮吾知必將廢然回師矣</p>
<p>以上就關係最大之問題促兩廣當局之反省如其誠意爲國未如一般所股憂疑慮與謠傳者則解釋機會現尚未失中央表示重視兩廣意見特召集二中全會以求今後方針之决定與指示兩廣意見可正式提出以供全體討論庶救國之步驟能獲一致增進團結圖存之力量免負分歧速禍之責任明達之兩廣當局其熟思焉</p>

<h3>英倫主教　論列中國現局</h3>
<p>（倫敦）基督教維多利亞區教務協會、頃在此間舉行年會、（按維多利亞教區包括香港及中國南部一帶、）當由坎德伯雷大中教藍博士發表演說、就中國現局、有所論列、略謂、就渠所見、中國間題、撲朔迷離、不易究詰、譬諸一謎、雖欲覓求解决之道、終不可得、「中國中央政府與廣東省關係若何乎、中國若干將領、呌囂跳踉．儼如現身舞台之上、有時演為悲劇、有時演為喜劇、各該將節間之關係、究若何乎、一切情形、殊難洞察眞相、迨至現在、則消息傳來、廣東對於中央政府、已有異動、迹象顯著、危機迫促、此其眞情又若何乎、」又謂、推求中國所由隍杌不安老、該國有悠久之文化、後代奕世相承、不知革新、殆卽原因之一乎、「夫當歐洲人之祖先、榛榛狉狉、未脫蠻野之習、猶與鹿豕為伍、而被中國、已有燦爛之文化、是其所秉承者至遠、而今猶傳述未湮也、雖然、中國入民、勤勞耐苦、習性良養、誠實可靠、此稱善德、今昔未殊、則其前途希望、必有未可限量者在、今茲縱在顛連困阨、動蕩不定之中、而異日必將蔚為偉大之民族、以喚醒其新生命、此其迹象、今巳顯著矣」云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（南京）據路透消息、六日倫敦各報、皆載廣州之反日消息、其驚恐之程度不一、惟消息靈通方面、似皆視此為對內而發、非眞直接抗日、孟却斯德指導報謂、西南政務會未經正式認為一國或認為獨立政府、故無宣戰之資格、惟今對大局作明白之諒解、尙嫌過早、將來或可藉談判而互相讓步、以獲解决云、（十日中央社電）</p>
<h3>李滋羅斯會見日藏相　再討論英日共同投資　發表中國交通增加人民購買力日望進一步解決英日通商問題</h3>

<p>（東京）李滋羅斯爵士、定十日午後四時半在藏相官邸會見馬塲藏相、關於中國之經濟、再檢討日英之提携、更進一步關於調整日澳日印日埃等最近日英問通商問題之全部、質詢日本財政當局之方針、開誠交換意見、惟馬塲藏相務必僅聽取李滋羅斯氏對中國財政經濟之認識與見解而止、至關於日本之態度、因高橋前藏相曾與羅斯氏會談、世上卽誤傳關於中日經濟問題已成立諒解、馬塲藏相鑑此先例、故持最愼重之方針、對於中日財政經濟之待殊關係、如羅斯氏之認識有誤謬時、則是正之、並闡明日本之特殊的地位、同時關於中國財政援助、及日英協調之必要、務必止於原則論云、（十日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）有田外相與李滋羅斯沃會談時、曾涉及世界市場之日英通商關係調整問題、故有田外相為急速解决此問題起見、特令歸國中之駐英大使館松山商務參事官、急速返任、氏定十日午後由橫浜乘秩父丸、經美國赴倫敦、松山氏為日本之生存及經濟發展之故、將向領有世界領城之四分之一之英國、要求自由開設市塲資原、以舉日英協調之實、而恢復世界經濟、故急速返任云、（十日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）磯谷軍務局長及有田外相分別會見李滋羅斯交換意見之結果知悉羅斯關於對華政策之見解、羅斯所表示之意見、簡言之、卽中國經濟之復興、卽為英國對華權益之擁護、又為英日兩國之利益、因此、英日兩國須力圖援助中國、當此援助、日本之協力乃為必要、英國如無日本諒解、不能單獨進行活動、換言之、英國不吝承認日本在東亞之特殊地位、羅斯如此意見、雖漸認識日本立塲、而其態度變為妥協的、然急於確保自國經濟的地位、關於政治的影響、似無多大關心、日本方面、認政治與經濟之關係不可分離、羅斯承認日本特殊地位、可謂其東亞之智識有進步、然若英國不由政治經濟之關係、覺悟中國政治的安定之必要、日英兩國之見解、尙有相當懸隔、日英協力對華援助之事、似雖實現（十日同盟電）</p>

<h3>胃痙攣與胃出血</h3>
<p>胃痙攣俗名胃痛，患之對極為普遍，症狀為胃部發痙攣性之疼痛，甚至痛及胸背下腹等處，殊屬危殆。胃出血奧喀血不同，蓋胃血不若肺血之鮮明紅艷，而為深暗色之污血，患者胃部有膨滿及劇度之灼熱感，胃部感動悸不安狀態，死亡率甚高。</p>
<p>對於胃痛之治法，除服專藥外，可用溫罨法，胸部貼以熱濕之布。至於胃出血，身體須絕對安靜，胃部貼付氷囊，二三日間絕食。並選服有效製劑之「强胃精」，以收縮胃血管，而增進胃機能，則神經亦獲矯正，於是胄痛自失，血亦止矣。許多臨床家之經騐，「强胃精」確善治一切急慢性胃病，如吞酸噯氣，嘈雜欲嘔，見食輒厭，腹部膨脹，或陣痛隱隱，大便秘結，或陽炎腹瀉，腸中多瓦斯而洩屁，營養不良，身體羸瘦等，若脚氣萎弱症，服以此藥，亦有特效，蓋本品內含維他命B故也，為常年養身及老人便秘，煙客戒煙之妙品。且以其飽含脾素，功擅壯補腦，血，振奮强大之食慾，而使胃納昂盛。食量旺增，關於「强胃精」藥，上海及外埠各大藥房，均有經售云。</p>
<h3>婦女之調經補腦還少法</h3>
<p>女性之生理，與男性構造不同，而靑春期亦比較為短，蓋過一定之年齡，卽現衰老之徵也，考其原因，乃由於卵巢液內分泌之消失，因之全身細胞之活力，漸趨衰弊，於是容顏枯萎，毛髮焦黃或易白，髮脫，精祕倦怠，恒致月經不調，超前或落後，心思遲鈍，心臟悸動，失眠，健忘，不姙，白帶下，眩暈腦痛，陷入極度之衰弱症。</p>
<p>若將卵巢機能重新改造，而振奮其內分泌，則病原旣去，各症皆除，具有此種功能者，厥為「補女容」一藥，服後因細胞之營養得以充分，故全身機能活潑，皮膚潤澤，容顏紅嫩，肌肉細繼，雖衰老可恢復靑春，其身體不發育之部分，如乳房枯瘦等，即可勃增發育，肥碩高聳，產後乳汁稀少，服之亦能增多，以其善于旺盛卵巢分泌，故月經不調，白帶，神經衰弱之失眠心悸，健忘不姙，腰滕痠軟無力，及髮白易落等等，莫不迅奏奇功，使身體永獲壯健之樂。</p>
<h3>淋病治法之注意</h3>
<p>— 周有仁譯</p>
<p>淋病之治療，與普通疾病不同，曁其他疾病，每可於一定之短時日內治痊，而淋病若不長續醫治，一次交合，即行復發，故在治療期中須聽醫生吩咐，謹愼攝生，且服藥須有恒心，非朝秦暮楚所許可也，市上每炫其淋藥一點鐘見效，兩盒斷根，致患者受愚，病變蜂起，殊屬可嘆，自法郎府大藥廠創製「克淋儂」驅淋聖藥以還，收效之迅捷，誠出人意外，因其係配合動物胆汗中之抗毒體而成，此為一種蛋白體，功可振奮體中天然之抵抗力，使淋菌悉數殲滅，一掃無遺，自此遂歸絕跡，而淋濁，炎痛，膿尿，皆得全部根瘳，惟須注意者，此藥經著名醫師及學者實騐，成謂須服至半打前後，即可達治愈之目的，治病非可兒戲，固不可將本品與他藥混服，且動物試騐之結果，保證毫無霸烈副作用，服之不敗胃腸，及無任何刺激，但購服時萬不宜妄信他人言，為康價雜牌之劣品所朦混，致誤行購服發生性命危殮。此層切宜認明「克淋儂」三字，庶可放心進服，年來本劑馳譽社會，實為－切急慢性淋病，合併症如睪丸攝護腺關節炎等，最有特效者，所以歐洲各國，無不竭誠歡迎本劑之進口也。</p>
<p>足下神經衰弱乎？　請服「補體康」！</p>
<p>人之事業成功與否，端賴敏捷頭腦，始能賦予吾人之生存權，然因種種關係，此敏捷之腦筋，不能維待久遠，於是不僅敏捷頭腦失去，即全身健康，亦化為烏有。歷從各人實地觀察，許多人之所以成為思想遲鈍，神經衰弱，實由於靑春發育期，濫施手淫，或早婚，與房事撾度，致靑春腺中途被其摧殘，生殖機能發育不全，矮小如兒童，或遺精，早洩，陰莖勃起力不充實。心悸亢進，頭痛失眠，記憶力，記銘力皆有顯著之减退。視力易倦，每次閱讀書報，即覺頭暈眼花，遇事索然無味，易動惱怒，因此對於一切專業，皆無成功之望。而人生做大之幸福，亦喪失殆盡，如夫婦之感情惡劣，久婚失孕，子嗣絕望。</p>
<p>欲治此等性神經衰弱之最適當之藥品，可向各大藥房購服「補體康」當可獲愈，因此藥係採取勇健活潑動物睪丸，以科學之新方法提出荷爾蒙製成之。服後先入血液，再由血液輸入缺乏荷爾蒙之靑春腺，使其起生殖機能旺盛之作用。全身均受其補益，轉弱為强，凡一切性神經衰弱，遺精，早洩，勃起力不堅，記憶力减弱等服「補體康」後，即能迅奏偉效矣。</p>
<h3>老白濁之原因療法</h3>
<p>老白濁之所以難愈，無非因其淋菌侵入內部，不易追勦，故屢愈繼發，愈發愈深，苟非施以適常醫治，恐終無徹底治愈之希望，尤可畏奢，厥為將此病毒，傳染妻子，以致白帶緾綿，膿血淋漓，而誘起月經之困難，此則更為不良之後果也。</p>
<p>大槪淋病在急性期間，大部分多在前尿道，前尿道之組織頗為簡單，故撲滅自易，若一朝成為慢性，則淋菌從前尿道而入後尿道，淋菌旣入後尿道，則其侵入之途徑甚多，如攝護腺，輸精管，精囊，睪丸等器官，皆易為琳菌所侵襲，同時並能併發數種以上之合併症，眞是變化不測，追勦困難，猶如流竄之匪，不易全數擒獲也。凡染淋病多年，大多呈睪丸脹痛，射精困難，晨起淋絲對口，此乃睪丸炎與輸精管炎併發症。宜更進服「克淋儂」以掃滅淋菌，鎭痛退腫，如此服用四五星期左右，卽可將淋菌治愈，雖經血淸檢查，當無淋毒反應。惟患此病，恒傳染妻子，故妻子亦多染白帶，局部因受膿毒刺戟，致影響小便，小腹膨滿不暢，亦當內服「克淋儂」，外用「卡而雪地陰道片」以治帶下，內外夾治，當於三四星期內而治全愈。</p>
<h3>肺結核病之最近學說</h3>
<p>肺結核乃今日世界到處蔓延之病，都市人口繁盛之區，肺病傳播極廣，而窮鄉僻壤，則不易見肺病之發生，被癆病侵佔之都市地，稱為結核馴地，不生癆病之地域，稱為結核處女地，後者一經癆菌侵入，即猛烈傳染，前者受癆菌之傳染，則患者多成為慢性。但吾人所應注意者，卽所謂感冒。查感留之藥劑，當首推法郎府大藥廠「補肺拿爾」一藥，因此藥有調節體溫中樞及除痰鎭咳等偉效。用於臨床實騐上，恒收殊功。又投諸一二三各期肺癆之咳血，喀痰，咳嗽，胸脇刺痛，皮膚蒼白，煩燥，榮養不良，不想睡眠，盜汗，頗面潮紅，貧血，體重日輕等等，皆可在二星期以至六星期左右，完全治愈，此層且有著名醫師之證明。又取之施治百日咳，與老年哮喘或慢性氣管炎你症，亦獲奇效。又凡遇患者在極度袞弱時，如失眠心悸及男子遺精腎虧，女子月經不調，可分別同時並服男用「補體康」與女用「補女容」旺盛體力，無不易獲瘳愈也。至於「補肺拿爾」一藥，可向就近藥房購服。因此藥各處藥房均有出售也。</p>

<p>（上海工商業槪况之二十七）</p>
<p>銷路一斑　織品銷路遍及中外，營營全盛時，全年貿易額，約在千餘萬兩，國內銷塲，除蘇浙等處外，平津東北諸省，實為最大市塲，幾佔全額之半，自瀋案以後，市場被奪，關係增高，運銷匪易，營業慘跌過半，年僅二百餘萬元。</p>
<p>考淸季後，兼亦有運銷外洋者，頗得歐美人士之贊美，樂於購用，出口年值三百餘萬兩，據悉運銷外洋之繡品，以繡枕，繡墊，檯圍，及人物風景為大宗，而錦繡衣服，亦所歡迎，蓋彼邦人士，古裝跳舞時所需，淸代補服，原極工緻，西人以之改製手錢袋，美觀適用，聞年來已搜羅殆盡，兼以世界經濟崩潰，外銷銳减，年祇值國幣百數十萬元，較二十年前，减少百分之七八十云。</p>
<p>商號調查　上海業刺繡者，在營業鼎盛時，獲利頗豐，經營者凡百餘家，十餘年內，災禍頻仍，經濟破產，市面日漸蕭索，營業一落千丈，因而無法維持，宣告收歇者，或改營他業以作副業者，比比皆是，今據調查所得，目下業刺繡者，約七十飲家，主要營業，咸以繡屏，繡枕，繡衣，花邊，桌衣，檯圍等繡件，尙有特殊營業外，其他繡品，槪已成為美術裝飾品，購買者殊少云，茲特較大者查報於后萬：</p>

<p>繡工槪况　刺繡為女子之手製工業，故凡經營繡業之一切繡件，端賴女子之短針穿梭，方能告成，故繡莊與刺繡者之關係，甚為密切，惟殊少長期雇用，咸係隨時散發按價計價，且工刺繡者，除少數城市間中下階級之女子，花家做刺繡外，泰半以鄉鎭女子充之，蓋取其生活簡單，繡　低廉也，聞蘇州，長沙，溫州，汕頭等處鄉民，男子除耕種，或出外經商外，女子十九在家做針繡，統計有三四萬人，每日繡資所得，足够溫飽，且技術高者名尙可餘蓄，故男子不務正業，在家依賴女子為生育，亦不在少數，近數年來，以農村破產，社會經濟崩潰，刺繡一業，一落千丈，繡莊倒閉，工作减少，數萬女工，無以為生，即幸而得工作者，亦你爭我奪，趨於跌價傾軋一途，致出口品惡劣，難於行銷，是以刺繡業每况愈下也。</p>

<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面呈先疲繼則高漲之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、回好八分至一角零不等、而天時已轉晴和、故開價時、各月份因此略軟、較前日近期小去一分零、遠期小半分、但至二盤以後、因國內之時局問題、謠言愈多、粉為軍糧之一、故又引起多頭之熱奮、各月份開價、遂又步振、迨至下午開盤、因謠言愈盛、一般人深恐因國內之爭執、而引動國際之料紛、則一旦交通方面、首受影響、是以買氣大暢、近遠各期、均一致高騰、新麥已經登場、且麥品年收、均較往年為佳、此種進展、實為時局所牽動云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份初見回跌、因天時良好、人心轉鬆、自本月份至九月份、曾較前日跌去三四五分不等、惟至收盤、因粉市回振、時局發生問題、故開價即俏、較前盤回好三四分、迨至下午開盤、初尚平靜、旋以紛市步步高昂、一般熱中投機、亦起劇然之購買、各月份較之上午初盤、計漲七八分至一角、較前日亦漲六七八分不等、至目下各路新麥、再過三四日、已可陸續暢到、惟客帮心思、則異常堅勁、昨開漢口麥七十包、價四元零五分、祇八折身分、照此推測、高貨當非二角左右不可云、</p>

<h3>王蝎</h3>
<p>— 蘇子涵</p>
<p>戰國時候的國家，全是此爭彼奪，幾乎年年都在打仗，如果兩國有仇，那仗更打不完了</p>
<p>那時齊湣王無道，對於臣子百姓都很暴虐。他又想做皇帝，同秦國平分天下。當齊湣王自稱東帝以後，正是燕王噲把王位讓給宰相子之的時候，燕國內亂，齊湣王就趁着這個機會，帶兵去攻打燕國。燕國已讓燕王噲同子之兩個人弄得一塌胡塗，兵不想打仗，百姓也不想守城，齊兵一來，勢如破竹，佔領了許多城池。燕王噲戰死了，子之却跑掉了，但是終歸沒有跑脫，被齊軍擒去，刴成肉醬。燕國的殘餘百姓却立燕王噲的太子做國王，就是燕昭王。</p>
<p>燕昭王登基之後，老記着齊湣王殺死自己的父親，攻打自己的國家的仇恨。他老想：「齊湣王太沒有道理了，趁着我國內亂，來攻打我國，殺死父王，佔去許多城池，此仇非報不可。不過燕國太小了，又在新敗之後，要想恢復起來，我得去聘請天下賢人，來做這救國的工作。」</p>
<p>於是燕昭王便禮賢下士，尊郭隗做老師，又修葺一院房子給郭隗住。天下的賢士都知道燕昭王禮賢下士，是想復國仇，報國恥的，天下的賢士大半到燕國去了。如像樂毅從魏國去，鄒衍從齊國去，劇辛往趙國去。</p>
<p>這樣過了二十多年。在這二十多年的長時間裏，燕昭王對於國家大事是很經心的，一點也不馬胡，待百姓也待得好，待軍士也待得好，眞可以說是與百姓士卒同甘苦了。一切生產事業，富國强兵事業，燕昭王也任用一些賢士去辦，辦得很好。燕國於是强盛起來了。燕昭王二十八年，就是齊湣王四十年，燕昭王命樂毅做上將軍，聯合各國人馬，去攻打齊國，殺得齊國人馬落花流水，大敗下去。各國人馬回去了，樂毅單獨帶領燕國的人馬殺進齊國的境內去，一路上勢如破竹，一直殺進齊國的都城臨菑。齊湣王跑到莒城去了，被楚國派來救齊國的將軍，名呌淖齒的所殺。樂毅在齊國五年，得了齊國的城池七十幾座，把燕國的失地全收復了，只莒同卽墨兩個城池沒有打下。</p>
<p>話說那時齊國有一個賢士，名呌王蝎，很有材幹，治一個國家，在他到不算怎樣難的事。可惜齊湣王不能用他，只落得在盡邑地方做一個種田的莊稼人。齊湣王雖然不能重用王蝎，但是王蝎的聲名却很大，國內國外知道他的人很多。</p>
<p>當樂毅帶領人馬剛進齊國境內的時候，就下令道：「齊國的賢人王蝎，聽說現在住在盡邑地方，凡隔盡邑周圍三十里以內的地方，我軍都不許進去騷擾，違令者斬！」</p>
<p>因爲有了王蝎，盡邑竟自免掉燕兵的騷擾</p>
<p>過了一向，樂毅已經打破齊國許多城池，得了許多土地，齊國的都城也打破了，齊湣王也趕走了，齊國離亡國的時侯不遠了。</p>
<p>樂毅想收拾齊國的民心，得來的城池才保守得永久。收拾民心的方法，再沒有比用本地的賢士更好的了。於是樂毅便想到王蝎。他想：「不用說，王蝎是賢士。爲了他，我不呌兵到盡邑去，總算對得住他。我現在呌人去請他出來，他一定會答應的。」</p>
<p>樂毅的使者到了盡邑，找到了王蝎的家，找到了王蝎，就向王蝎說：「小將領了樂將軍的命令，來請先生。樂將軍說：『先生是齊國第一個有材幹的人，特別請先生出去做參謀，以後把齊國平了，奏明燕王殿下，一定封先生一個萬戶侯。』</p>
<p>王蝎聽了，一點不躊躇，馬上就回答道：「我是齊國人，現在齊國快要亡了，我便是一個亡國的人。亡了國家的人有甚麽用處。我只願在齊國的土地上耕田，不願去做燕國的官」</p>
<p>樂毅的使者勸了許久，說得個舌臘唇焦，王蝎只是一萬個不應允。使者無法，只好回大營去了。</p>
<p>樂毅的使者回到大營，把王蝎的話向樂毅說了，樂毅聽了，很有些不高興，沉吟了一會，又想得一個主意。便又呌使者再去請王蝎。臨走的時候，樂毅在使者耳朶邊說了幾句話。</p>
<p>樂毅的使者又到了盡邑，又到了王蝎的家，又找着王蝎，板着面孔向王蝎說：「小將又奉了樂將軍的命令來請先生。樂將軍說：「如果先生一定不出去，就要帶領人馬把盡邑的人殺個乾乾凈凈。」先生聽小將的勸，還是出去好，又做了官，又保了這一邑的生靈。」</p>
<p>樂毅的意思是想去威嚇王蝎，王蝎一怕，不是就出來了。誰知王蝎是不怕嚇的。</p>
<p>當是王蝎聽了，仰面向天，冷笑了幾聲，說道！「一個愛自己祖國的人，决不會爲了做官，或者是爲了怕死，去投降敵入的。我是齊國人，我愛齊國，我永遠不離開齊國，我願齊國强盛。可惜齊王殿下不用我，如果齊王殿下用了我，你們也來不到這裏。齊王殿下不用我，我只好在這裏耕田，還是不離開齊國。旣在國家快要亡了，可恨我一個入的力量太小，人心又不整齊，不能把國家救住。我與其活着做亡國奴，還不如給你們煮了的好，更不用提做你們燕國的官了。好在樂毅只是想見見我這一個人，把我的頭取去他看看，還是一樣的。也呌他知道齊國不盡是漢奸，還是有富貴榮華不能誘惑，武力不能壓迫的人。」</p>
<p>王蝎說完，就把樂毅的使者推出大門，把門關了。回身進到裏面，把衣冠穿戴好，拿了一根繩子，走到後院內，尋了一根樹子，端相了一陣，便大呌道：「皇天在上，列祖列宗在上，王蝎的力量太小了，活着不能救國，只能以一死報國；死後也一定要盡我的責任。」王蝎說完，就爬上樹去，用繩子把自己的頸子綁在樹幹上，奮力一掙，就把頸子掙斷了。</p>
<p>王蝎一死，激動了許多人，都說：「王蝎不過是一個普通老百姓，都能盡忠報國，何况我們大小還是一個官。我們不去救國，眞慚愧死了！」於是大家跑到莒城去，找着齊湣王的太子法章，立做國王，會同守卽墨城的田單，同燕兵抗戰。俟後田單用反間計調開樂毅，用火牛計殺敗燕兵，把失去的城池土地都恢復了，齊國仍是那樣大。這都是王蝎的忠義激起來的，王蝎不算白死了。</p>
<h3>勝家Isaac　Merrit　Singer（1811-1975）</h3>
<p>— 鐘寶</p>
<p>—縫紉機發明家—　父親因爲悲觀失敗　兒子因爲樂觀成功</p>
<p>勝家於一千八百一十一年，生於美國紐的，父親是個磨機匠。家境困難，沒有力量多讀書：勝家進學校剛剛認得幾個字，便被迫着退學了。他離校那一天，父親很悽慘的流着淚對他說道：「見，我也知道求上進是非讀書不可的。我小的時候，誰都說我是一個天才，那時我便有志做一個發明家了。不幸後來我沒機會念書，什麽科學的道理都不懂，結果只能做一個磨機匠！好容易得到一個像你這樣伶俐和好學的兒子，論理我應該供你讀書成人。無如我們現在窮到連吃麵包也發牛問題，怎能讓你進學校？兒，你將來的命運，恐怕會比我還糟呢！……一他嗚嗚咽咽的哭起來，不能成聲了</p>
<p>此時勝家已經是十多歲的靑年了。他懂得許多人情世故，做人樂觀而積極。他相信他的前途無量，父親的話，他不願聽。假如是別人說的，他早已掩着耳朶走了。但出於可憐的父親的口，他不得不聽：他看見老人家這樣傷心，也不得不和他表同情。他忙走上前來一面替父親擦淚，一面安慰他道：「兒有把握做人，命運在兒的手上。兒將來一定能成功一個發明家，爸爸願幹而幹不到的事情，兒可以替爸爸幹。不用憂心，一切都交給兒罷</p>
<p>父親心裏寬慰了幾分，看着站在面前的兒子慢吞呑的說道：「這怎行？你才你這一點點書！」</p>
<p>勝家道：「讀書當然改進學校爲方便。但有志讀書的人，那裏不可以讀呢，何必一定要進學校？况且讀書只能給我們智識，不能給我們經騐。經騐是每個發明家所不能短少的。讓我出去謀生，學學做人，得多些經騐來做發明的準備罷。整天埋頭在書本裏，不懂得社會需耍的是什麽，也不能激起發明的情緒，促人决定發明什麽。」</p>
<p>「兒，你說得對！」父親高興起來了，「我小的時侯，雖然有志做發明家，因爲經騐少，不知道社會的需要，未曾决心發明什麽。也許就是因爲立志不堅，所以一生做着生活的奴隸，一事無成罷？兒，你就可以拿我做鑑戒了。將來你出來做事，凡事高高興興的學，多求經騐。不要像我整天愁着眉把一切事情當作苦工，結果終年作工，不但得不到經騐，反苦壞了自己。現在未老先衰，什麽事情也做不得了！」父親說到這裏，苦着臉兒，快要哭了。勝家忙引別的事情說，分開父親的注意，讓他忘記了他追悔不及的錯誤，免得痛苦。</p>
<p>其實勝家比他父親年靑的時侯困難得多了。父親還能好好地念幾年書，好好地做幾年學徒。勝家迫着退學，書一放下，就要負家庭的負担。爲要馬上賺錢，就沒機會做學徒，只能準備當熟練的工人，做些不用技巧的粗工。粗工費力大，報酬少，很少人願意幹的。可是勝家抱着求經騐的决心，不怕辛苦，好好的幹。一口氣做了七年，他發覺了自己對於機器發生趣味，於是去做機器學徒。才學了四個月，家用無着，迫得不幹學徒，四處爲衣食奔走；到這一州做機器匠，又到那一州做店員：足足過了九年流浪生活。</p>
<p>在流浪的過程中，勝家一面工作，一面研究機器。到了二十八歲那年，他發明了鑽石機（A　rock.drilling　Machine），跟着又發明了刻木和刻金機（A　wood　metal-carving　Machine）。得了專賣權後，他便籌錢開一個工廠來製造仰所發明的機器。不想他的工廊開了不久，汽窩爆炸，整個工廠連着也炸倒了，累得勝家不但破產，並且欠了一身債。他的親友都替他傷心，但他自己樂觀如故。他說：『「失敗爲成功之母。」如果我能不爲失敗。灰心，受過這次大敎訓，我會更加謹慎的研究，說不定我能抓着什麼大道理，發明一種更有價値的東西出來。』</p>
<p>勝家有一位朋友，呌做狄柏爾，在波士頓一個機器廠裹做事，看見勝家窮無所歸，招他來一塊工作。一個月明星稀的晚上，狄柏爾携着勝家的手，出外散步去。他們說說笑笑，無意中走到一條女縫衣街來。街邊有一塊準備蓋房子堆滿木頭的空地。勝家和狄柏爾就坐在木頭堆裏談天。他們很起勁的而談機器學，談彼此的發明志願談到得意處，狄柏爾道：「勝家，你還好，你已經發明兩種機器了，我不知道我自己到那一天才能弄一點成績出來呢。」勝家答道：這値得什麽，我從來不當我創造出來的那兩種機器是什麼發明，因爲牠們的效用太少。等我能發明一種機器，這利益可以遍及全世界的人，允其是窮苦的人，我才滿意呢。但我現在還不知道發明什麽好。你……」</p>
<p>時夜將半，街上行人絕跡，四圍靜悄悄地，只剩勝家淸脆的談聲。不意鄰近忽然有人唱歌，音調悲婉動人，勝家始打斷話柄，傾耳靜聽只聽見悽凉的女人聲音唱道：指頭刺破了，不敢道乏；眼睛紅腫了，不敢貪眠。可憐縫衣女，手不離針綫，千針萬針辛苦縫，一日三餐難得飽。年年替人作嫁衣，誰知此中悲苦味！勝家聽了很受感動，含着淚問狄柏爾道：「一是誰唱的歌」？。</p>
<p>狄柏爾冷冷淡淡的說道：「你還不知道這條街是女縫衣街嗎？除了縫衣女唱的還有誰？」勝家聽了他這漠不關情的口氣，更加難受，心裏不禁想道：「縫衣女也是人呀，何以她們這般苦楚，沒人救濟她們；甚至多情如狄柏爾還不知道和她們表同情呢？……」他低下頭獃想了一回，忽然想出道理來了。他問狄柏爾道：「我去發明一個縫紉機好嗎？」</p>
<p>狄柏爾嗤的一聲笑道：「我以爲你在想什麼，原來打算救濟縫衣女！」此時天際無雲，月明如畫，狄柏爾的狡笑，勝家看得很淸楚。但他不怕狄柏爾和他開玩笑，依舊坦然的說道：一確有此心，難道這是不可能的嗎？」狄柏爾道：這「也不是不可能，但確是件難事。這幾十年來，想要發明縫紉機的人不知道有多少，結果一個　失敗。——也許牠是等你發明罷。」狄柏爾又來一　狡笑。勝家道：「不要開玩笑，我們商量發明縫紉車的事罷。」歌聲又起來了，狄柏爾怕善感的勝家，聽了道悲凉的聲調又要感傷了，就把他强拉回廠去了。</p>
<p>狄柏爾見勝家這樣熱心要發明縫衣機，而且計劃得井井有條，就借四十塊錢給他做資本，又替他請求廠主人借工塲一角來給他做試騐發明縫紉機的塲所。</p>
<p>勝家得到狄柏爾的帮助，感激知己，更加努力。他早晚都在塲裏工作，一天只睡三四點鐘，吃一頓。就是這一頓，也不過吃二三片麵包和一杯鹽水便算了。他整天拿着鐵鎚，捶鍊機器，直至夜裏二點鐘才放手，縮進一個像鷄籠一樣的宿舍睡覺，天還未亮便一骨碌跳下來工作。這樣過了好幾個月，他才看見他的機器，能轉運，能囓布，能縫紉。他歡喜若在，奔出來吿訴人。</p>
<p>這個消息一傳出來，馬上便有許多人跑出來圍着勝家的工塲，要求勝家表演給他們看，勝家當然很高興的遵命了。不想表演時，機器忽然和他別扭，不能囓布了：等到能囓布時，又不能縫紉。這時有的駡他說謊騙人，掛羊頭，賣狗肉。有的掩口暗笑，諷嘲百出。勝家急得滿頭是汗，沒法申辯，羞憤到幾乎要自殺。但想到他的恥辱不是自殺所能洗刷的，又依舊低下頭工作去。這樣再苦幹了，幾個月，縫紉車果然給他發明了。到了此時，從前笑他駡他了人都跑來向他道歉道賀了。他的縫紉機很快便風行全世，受他的恩惠的，豈止那天晚上月夜悲歌的那個縫衣女郞呢？</p>

<h3>關於教科書編訂和專賣問題</h3>
<p>— 獨秀</p>
<p>最近作者得到了一個比較可靠的傳說，就是敎科書之編訂，將一律由敎育部負實辦理，不准各書局自由編訂；敎科書之發行，由敎育部交給某一個書局發賣；因此現在各書局，正在爭奪這一個專賣權問題。</p>
<p>這消息是吾屬實，作者不得而知；就是說確實，那麼究竟實施的辦法如何，作者也沒有知道。因爲這事件之性質太重大，因此不揣愚陋聊貢蒭蕘之見，以爲敎育最高當局以及社會人士的參考。</p>
<p>編訂敎科書之權，亟應統一，是作者半素堅持的主張，不過編訂權之統一較易，統一以後而能內容完美則難。因此，這問題就在於如何編製，假定不詳審國情之需要，地方之情形，兒童之環境，那麽編製出來的敎科書，一定不能實現我們的理想，此其一；同時編訂敎科書原則方面的確定，固有賴於專家的審愼商討，而實際編製的工作，還需要種種敎學方面實際的經騐，如何在編訂時能雙方兼顧，此其二；以我國疆域之廣，文化程度之不統一，希望以一種敎科書來適應全國的需要，一定是不可能，那麼如何可使各地方不感覺到困難，此其三。道三大問題，是編訂敎科書時三個先决條件，這三個先决條件沒有妥善的法定，我們决不能想像統一以後的敎科書會有完善的結果，這是關於編訂方面而言。</p>
<p>敎科書編定以後，就是一個發賣問題。作者認爲假定交由某一書局專賣，其弊無窮，而且一定可以引起種種無謂的誤會。最好的辦法，敎育部對於任何一種敎科書，所有紙張，排印，封面，字體等，都有一個規定，而且定價若干，也由敎育部訂定，任何書局，經敎育部認可後，均可出版發賣，以其銷數之多寡，抽版稅若干；抽下的版稅，以爲編輯敎科書者的報酬。這一種辦法，一可以免除各書局專賣後的居奇；二可以免除各書局的競爭；三可以免除種種無謂的誤會；三可以使一般學生家長减輕一點負担。</p>
<p>敎科書之統一編訂，與統一編訂後的發賣問題，的確事關重大，而且應該亟求其實現的，不過這實施的辦法，實有加以萬分審愼考慮的必要。</p>
<h3>明日之康藏滇桂問題（續）</h3>
<p>— 吳企雲</p>
<p>方秋葦著　世界出版</p>
<p>偌大的一塊東北，現在給日本拿去了；偌大的一塊西北，倘使日本的西進政策急進，那麼也立刻可以嚴重；倘使西南冉不設法，這偌大的　藏滇桂，也是列强的囊中之物了。中國的邊疆問題並不是發生於今日，但嚴重危迫之狀，莫過於今日！</p>
<p>同時，一個國家是有整個的連環性的，東北發生問題，並不是東北的存亡問題，而整個中國的存亡問題；西北亦然，西南允何　不然？而且東北問題在國際方面的瓜葛還少，西南問題一發生，必然地牽連到西北問題，形成了與遠東有關的如列强的大衝突，衝突的結果，常然是由戰爭或分贓而走到瓜分的一條路上去，影響到了整個中國的存亡問題！</p>
<p>要希望解决西南問題，應先從認識西南，硏究西南做起，那麼筆者敬至誠地推薦這本「明日之康藏滇桂問題」一書於讀者大衆之前。</p>
<p>該書從帝國主義者侵略弱小民族的必然性說起，其次從地理方面分析西藏，西康，雲南，廣西的一切現狀；再說到英法在西南方面　略的歷史，以及侵略的現狀；最後冉加以綜合的比較和分析。讀了這一本書以後，非但可得到一個輪廓的概念，已經可涉臘到專門性的研究了。該書有十萬言，定價五角，世界書局出版。（完）</p>

<h3>父母十信條</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>全國兒童年實施委員會，頃擬訂一父母十信條，頒發各省市一體實行，這的確是代兒童謀幸福的好辦法。父母是兒童的保育者，所以我們要希望兒童能成器，就應萬分注意父母對於兒童的敎養。全國兒童里年實施委員會，這次有父母十信條的頒發，其用意當也在此。</p>
<p>父母十信條是擬訂得很適當的，要做一位負責任的父母，必需具有　十項信心。倘家庭之爲父母的，能依照這信條實行，對於兒童的敎養，定有很大的好處。因此我們希望一般父母，對於這十信條，能加以相當的注意。</p>
<p>我們想父母十信條，分成敎養兩項。（一）在可能限度下，應當給予兒童以適當的物質環境，（二）供給兒童的衣食住，應以合於衛生爲第一條件，（三）應一天到晚，使兒童過快樂的生活，這三項是養的方法。（四）爲養成兒童良好習慣，應當以身作則，（五）應當對於兒童絕對的守信約，（六）兒童和我們發生　　時，應當反省自己，有無錯誤，（七）哄騙或威嚇體罰，决不是訓育兒童的方法，（八）應當常常獎勵兒童承認自己的錯誤，不諉過於人，（九）養成兒童服務社會的習慣，或使每日做一件有益社會的事，（十）培養兒童愛國的觀念，應從使兒童服用國貨做起，這七項是敎的方法。</p>
<p>關於敎的方面，以身作則，的確是父母敎育兒童的最好方法。一個父母要使兒童養成好品行，應由自己做起，作兒童里的榜樣。父母不能以身作則，怎末可以誘導兒童學好？養成兒童服務社會的習慣，和培養兒童愛國的觀念，也是很重要的兩點，爲家庭父母所不能不注意的。</p>
<p>關於養的方面，給予兒童以適當的物質環境，是很必要的。但這一點在一部份生活優裕的家庭，是容易做到的。若一般窮父母，就無能爲力。誰不喜歡使自己的兒童，過舒適的生活？無奈貧苦的家庭，物質環境很惡劣。兒童自然也要吃苦。改良之道，就要希望社會能給予他們多少的帮助。</p>
<p>最後我們在十信條之外，更希望家庭之爲父母的，不耍把兒童視爲私產，不要把兒童的地位看低。大家負起責任，用最適當的方法，保育我們的兒童。</p>
<h3>第四個兒子</h3>
<p>— 長風</p>
<p>當第三個兒子死的時候，李老爺剛在總會里打牌。李老爺已經是四十脚邊的人了，如果第一個兒子在世，或許李老爺可以抱孫子了。每逢到親戚朋友家里有喜事，李老爺馬上老淚縱橫地想起他的第一個兒子來。「我前世作了什麽孽？什麽孽？」他會隨手抓着一件東西碰着摔着，「一個兒子都留不住，留不住！」因爲李太太第二胎又是小產，據女僕人說，也是個男胎，頭髮都生齊了。</p>
<p>但是李太太却不像李老爺那樣心急，她自己騙着自己：「我們又不是七十一百，年紀輕輕的怕什麽！我又是個男肚皮。」太太笑着拍着肚皮的時候，李老爺似乎又放了心，裝起笑容來回答他的太太：「我們不做虧心事，眞怕沒有兒子嗎？」</p>
<p>可是李老爺總沒有太太那樣自然，一車轉身，又被兒子問題絞着他的心。就在那個時候，由他太太的慫恿，朋友的勸吿，李老爺學會了打牌。每天上總會去，把兒子問題，的用心放到白板發財上去。</p>
<p>四十歲那年，李太太又懐孕了。那一陣他在總會里每天打順牌，知道了這消息，他高興着說：</p>
<p>「時來運來，打牌都順手，四十得子，也不能算遲呵！」</p>
<p>李太太自然也笑開了眼，好像她已經抱了兒子那樣有把握地回答她的丈夫：「不是嗎？姜太公八十纔娶親哩！我又是個男肚皮，怕什麽？你不要給人家知道，可以在牌上發一筆小財啊！」（鄕俗將娶親或妻子懐胎，打牌可以必勝。）</p>
<p>李老爺眞是每天打順牌，他高興極了，心里無時無刻不念着「一定是兒子！一定會兒子！這牌不是預兆嗎？」</p>
<p>到他生日那一天，朋友們到他家裏賀喜，才發現李太太的肚皮有小丘那樣高，穿着一件脫了鈕扣的旗袍蕩出蕩進招呼賓客。在開懷暢飲的時候，一個每天李老爺同桌打牌的朋友說了；「老李雙喜臨門，怪不得他的牌風那樣順手。老李，你瞞着我們，你說該罰不該罰？」</p>
<p>「該罰！該罰！」大家鼓掌和着。</p>
<p>「該罰！該罰」李老爺是那樣得意，「我倍諸位一杯酒，罰一百紅蛋如何？」</p>
<p>李老爺仰着勃子舉起杯來一飲而盡，兩支手抱着拳頭在席上擺來擺去，幾乎像他大兒子彌月時候一樣高興，那天喝了個爛醉。</p>
<p>一個月後，李太太臨盆了，果然一個兒子。</p>
<p>朋友們因爲李老爺老來得子，大家計議着在彌月時大大熱閙一下，在牌桌上更想出許許多多花樣來，會唱戲的預備唱戲，不會的請堂會；而且討吉利起見，把那小孩子寄名給一位多子的朋友，也預備在彌月那天舉行。</p>
<p>可是第三個兒子生下來就不長成，多病。一天，李老爺在總會里打牌，家里的僕人說孩子病重要他回去，那天離彌月　一星期。</p>
<p>孩子不要吃奶，也不哭，請來的醫生都搖搖頭，對於那個出世二十多天的孩子都不敢用藥，甚至勸李老爺請一位有經騐的童生姑娘來試試看。（童生姑娘常常用莫明其妙的土法醫治病症的）</p>
<p>但是那些靈騐的土法都沒有效力。孩子祇有一口氣在喉間打滾着，他已經不能受藥了。在彌月的前兩天，他結束了他的生命，把李老爺從希望的高峯推到冰冷的冰窖里。李太太也失望地吐了一句：「我們命里眞沒有子息嗎？」</p>
<p>李老爺幾天的飲食，睡眠失了規則，自然沒有與　上總會去打牌，那些朋友同樣從熱望的預點降到冰點，彷彿自家的事情一樣想不方法來勸慰李老爺。李老爺祗有瘋了似的在房里打着圈子，一件東西抓到他手里的時候，就隨地摔了個粉碎，彷彿那件東西就是置他兒子於地的。</p>
<p>「前世作了什麽孽！什麼孽！」他祇能這樣喊着：「那些討債鬼！討不盡的債！討不盡的債！」</p>
<p>李太太也消失了「我是個男肚皮」的勁去安慰她的丈夫。三個兒子沒有留得一個，「男肚皮」有什多用呢？</p>
<p>過後，李老爺忽然想開了，命里註定沒有兒子非入力可以挽回的。他還是每天上總會去打牌，或者拉着太太朋友去聽，一個高興起來，上杭州蘇州住上十天半個月。他三不時正經地對太太說：「命里註定沒有兒子，我們享享福罷！兩脚一伸，都是別人的，老來窮，才是苦哩！」</p>
<p>可是第四個兒子又在太太肚里生了根，又是一天一天地高漲起來，像小丘一樣地堆在李老爺眼前。</p>
<p>「討債鬼！討債鬼！」李老爺彷彿和誰鬥氣似的罵着。但是潛伏着念頭也在他腦海里滋長起來，一不過二，二不過三，現在是第四個了，自己命里或許要養老來子的。</p>

<p>— 聲</p>
<p>（各業調査）電泡業是分爲好幾種的，有專做電燈用的大電泡；有專做汽車用的汽車泡；有專做手電筒用的小電泡（卽電珠）。那些資本宏大的廠家，自然各種具在製造，但是範圍比較小的，大都是專製造一種或兩種。這幾種電泡業中，要算製造小電泡業的資本最有伸縮性，據說有些小廠家靠三五百的現金的流動，也在那裏開廠製造哩。因爲小電業具有家庭工藝的特質，所以開辦起來，也此較容易。話雖這麽說，其實小電泡業製造的工程興大電泡業製造的工程是差不了多少的。你不要小覷了牠，當一只小電泡製造成功可以上在手電筒裏發亮時，眞也不知要經過多少工作者的步驟和手續啊。</p>
<p>現在我就將不大　人注意的小電泡業製造的工作過程，　一個槪念在下面</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>（一）繞鎢絲和鎢珠銅絲：繞鎢絲是第一步工作，這種工作，大約一個女士就可担任。因為繞鎢絲機是用馬達的，則使手搖機，每天也可繞到幾萬的數目。工作很輕便，工價亦高。這種原料都來自國外。據說德國和意大利的出品最好，日本也有製造的。價甚昂，以米突多少計算的。但燙珠的銅絲則不然；因為牠是有粗細分別，所以是以磅數計算的。燙珠的工人，將銅絲兩頭吊在弓棒上，－手拿住弓背，一手握着有色的玻璃條，放在自來火上使其溶化，繞一圈在銅絲上，膠住後，就像一粒小圓珠。這樣的圓珠每根銅絲要燙上三十五六粒。這種工作者，多是外來的女工，她們的代價是以每根銅絲計算的。每燙滿百根，約法幣三角許。一天也可燙到百三四＋根的。（未完）</p>

<p>開篇「秦良玉」</p>
<p>明社垂危國家傾。不圖蜀有女將軍。經文緯武秦良玉。太息英雄不櫛兵。溯自他，年甫髫齡承父敎。一家訓練作干城。同懷兄妹諧韜略。偏是蛾眉不讓人。再說那，石柱千乘求鳳侶。英雄兒女兩聯姻。鬚眉巾幗賢伉儷。一代英豪傳令名。勸夫君，大好男兒酬壯志。必定要，捨身救國立奇勳。想見那，沙傷劍戟排兵陣。軍令森嚴白桿兵。當其時，時局紛紜多變故。二人禦敵莫能攖。旌旗　鼓聲威壯。不愧夫人娘子軍。可恨那，閹宦弄權陷地獄。千乘　斃赴幽冥。看他是，身披縗經從軍去。有志復　願未伸。幸而是，奉命入都來襲職。易裝冠軍卸釵裙。紅妝一騎桃花馬。綠襯雲　細柳營。只見他，蜀錦征袍汚戰血。馳驅王路效忠誠。他又是，毀家紓難勤干事。慷概輸財不吝金。這是那，天地錦靈生獨秀。河山間氣壯斯人。更羨他。賜袍褒美傳千古。身受榮封表國旌。還有那，有　祥麟昭大節。一門忠義樂身殉。到後來，獻　懷奸强褫職。土崩瓦解痛亡明。但我是，撫今懷音多憂杞。只望那，同脫合力救國魂。切　是，依稀紙上樂談兵。</p>

<p>同樂（七二〇）午夜一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「紅樓夢」「黛玉悲秋」</p>
<p>梧桐葉落立秋天。黛玉是，觸景生悲百感牽。奴想，自己嬌容消瘦極。多愁多病或多眠。宛如夏季的花和卉。到了秋天色不妍。又想那，秋月凄凉如水潔。令人一見動心絃。比那，廣寒宮內的嫦娥女。不及她，能逃出情關了俗緣。遇着那，秋雨連宵天不霽。芳心抑鬱恨難填。怨那，雨師不願秋花損。日夜綿綿濕鳳仙。更有秋風金鐵似。摧殘秋木有誰憐。宛如執法的秋官似。狂殺那，無罪佳人心太偏。見那，秋雁孤飛高又遠。嗚聲悲切在天邊。只因聽得弓弦響。所以，飛入雲中免性命捐。又見那，秋燕粉粉歸去急。呢喃話別不流連。複聽那，秋蟲唧唧鳴聲衆。如秋爾瀟瀟徧大千。更見那，秋露如珠容易滅。和水中泡影一般然。想人生一世亦似朝露。</p>

<h3>「大地」攝製經過</h3>
<p>— 萊</p>
<p>關于米高梅公司攝製中國的影片「大地」一片，至今已有了很大的變更，此新片不久前已在好萊塢開始製作。</p>
<p>原來此片導演的意思，是將本片中所有的演員均由中國人士充任，而且說中國話，現在已大大的變更了，外國的演員充任重要的角色，對白改為英語，保爾牟尼飾王龍，為一中國農夫，雷絲琳琅（Iuice　Ralner)—現在好萊塢的奥的奧大利女星—飾阿蘭，為王龍的妻子。</p>
<p>保爾牟尼前曾在薩克拉門圖谷與幾個華僑農民相處，以紊習他們的個性，耕種和各種動作。琳瑯女士不久前也紊會了她應所知道的動作與態度。此片的導演是佛郎明，歐洲著名攝影家卡爾弗力恩德（Karl　Frond)為此片之攝製人。</p>
<p>美國影界傳聞，保爾牟尼已理會了不少的中國字，且能很眞實的將道個角色的性格表現出來，和中國農夫們類型的姿態舉止，以及其他的特性。</p>
<p>像中國式的大道，現已見於沿落杉機至查茨泥期市的大道，有一廣大的場所用於大地一片；有數百華人被僱用，（不說話）現正工作在數里山地，其中有華北農材耕地的器具，用于農田的灌溉。</p>
<p>麥和米的田地，已經種植了，此片之後半部製作，須待米麥成長之後。一個中國式的城鎭，是特地請了中國建築師打樣造成的。</p>
<p>「大地」的電影台本，是弗蘭茜瑪倫女士和導演喬治希爾Gteorge　Hill兩人改編的。助理編劇者有前上海大陸報職員蓓蒂王女士和莫瑞司劉，後者是上海人。</p>
<p>米高梅「大地」攝影隊，曾于一九三五年一月抵上海，在中國攝影，先後費時六月，其主要的人物，是弗蘭克莫森吉，查理司海，和喬治克拉克。喬治希爾于返美後自殺。他們到中國後，拍攝了不少外景，主要的地方是在北平，上海，和蘇州。</p>
<p>當米高梅攝影隊離上海時，他們委托了外籍律師歐樂滿帮助在中國物色演員，他們在上海平津刋登廣吿徴求，結果有數百人往攷，而僅有十五人未落選。但是將這十五人在上海試騐的成績送至米高梅公司却又認為都不滿意，不得已祇好用外國的演員了。</p>
<p>自米高梅攝影隊離華返美後，中國政府代表杜廷修氏即隨來駐于好萊塢監視一切，米高梅當局也請他留在這裹，直等到此片完成。</p>
<h3>「慾海今潮」</h3>
<p>南京映</p>
<h3>金城將開放冷氣</h3>
<p>並新添空氣調節器</p>
<p>上海開映西片的頭輪影獻院，如大光明，國泰和南京等，雖均有冷氣設備，而映國產影片之戲院，有冷氣設備者，祗有金城一家。金城的冷氣機，係由冷氣專家約克洋行承裝；去年夏季，已博得極佳的輿論，大家都說足與大先明的冷氣設備相比擬，今見為精益求精起見，更不惜鉅金，新添空氣調節器，俾使全院空氣，不乾不滋，適乎中庸。現時正在日夜趕工裝置，不日即可開放，天氣漸熱，這也許是全滬影迷所願意聽見的一個消息。</p>

<h3>Cantonese Troops Approach Hengzhou; Bai Chongxi Remains in Nanning; Yan, Lu, and Han Telegraph Chen and Bai Yesterday, Requesting a Trip to Nanjing to Discuss Major Plans; 14th Group Army Delays Swearing-in Ceremony</h3>
<p>British Consul in Changsha Issues Warning to British Nationals in Southern Hunan</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yan Xishan and Lu Hanfuqu have both telegraphed Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi, requesting a trip to Nanjing to discuss major plans. Long Yun's representative, Liu Zhenhuan, returned to Yunnan on the 10th to report. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A German ship transported dozens of boxes of machinery to Guilin for purchase. On the 10th, they were transported to Guilin via the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Second Army Headquarters moved to Lechang on the 10th. Xiang Hanping left the province with his mother on the 9th to return to his ancestral home in Hepu. Yu Hanmou requested leave to stay in the province to treat hemorrhoids and will return to his post after recovery. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The swearing-in ceremony of the 14th Group Army has been postponed until they arrive in Hengzhou. Chen Renhe, a representative from Fujian, arrived in Guangzhou on the 9th. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yang Xiji stayed overnight in Pingshi on the 10th and is expected to arrive in Changsha on the 11th. The Sixth Division, led by Huang Zhiwen, will depart from Yingde in batches for Hunan on the 11th and 12th. On the 10th, the Guangdong Railway transported over 600 military dependents from the North River back to Guangdong. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hengzhou: The news of Southern troops occupying Hengzhou is unconfirmed. However, according to sources near the railway, Cantonese troops are gradually approaching the city. (Reuters dispatch, 2 PM, 10th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Southwestern troops are still pouring into southern Hunan. Two columns of Cantonese and Guangxi troops are gathering in Hengzhou, 95 miles south of Changsha. It is expected they will join forces there by June 15th and then advance together towards Changsha. According to current information, Bai Chongxi remains in Nanning, which has become a crucial political center, attracting military leaders. Hu Zongduo, former commander of the Guangxi army stationed in Wuhan, is among them. Zhao Hengti, the governor of Hunan Province, has also suddenly arrived, drawing considerable attention. It is reported that Zhao is frequently meeting with Chen Jitang to discuss the military situation in Xiangtan Province. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Although there has been no official statement from the Southwest authorities regarding the establishment of an independent government, well-informed sources here believe that such a move is likely if war breaks out. Some anticipate that the Southwest authorities may establish a People's Government. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The British Consul in Changsha, Mr. Beattie, has issued a temporary warning to British nationals in southern Hunan, advising them to prepare to relocate to safer areas. It is believed that the American Consul has issued a similar warning to American citizens. The British gunboat HMS Scarab sailed to Changsha last night. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) As the Southwestern armies continue to advance into Hunan province, banks in Guangzhou are increasingly anxious about the deteriorating situation. As a result, they are again buying Hong Kong dollars in large quantities today, causing the market price of Chinese currency to continue to plummet. Cantonese troops continue to advance from Chenzhou and have now pressed into Hengzhou. Guangxi troops remain in Qiyang County, 40 miles southwest of Hengzhou. Although the occupation of Hengzhou is only a matter of time, claims that the Southern troops have already taken it are premature. It is rumored that several Cantonese military commanders disagree with the northern advance and have protested. Yu Hanmou is said to be a key protester and has been detained at the Cantonese army headquarters. While this has not been officially confirmed, it is widely believed to be true, as Yu has not been seen in public in recent days and is definitely not among the commanders departing for the "front lines." Yu's troops are currently stationed in southern Jiangxi, and their attitude is unclear, leaning more towards the Central Government than Guangdong. Miao Peinan is also a well-known general in the Southern army, and it is believed that he has also been detained. Li Yonggen (transliteration), the commander of the Third Army, has also gone to Hong Kong because he disagrees with Guangdong's attitude. Due to recent developments in the Southwest, Li Jishen appears poised to re-enter the political arena. Reliable sources here report today that Li has arrived in Nanning. It is believed that when Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi lead their troops north, Li Jishen will become the chairman of Guangxi Province. There are also rumors that Chen Mingshu has arrived in Nanning. Nanning has now become a gathering place for elements opposing the Central Government. It is reported that the Guangdong government has invited Cai Tingkai, a famous general of the 19th Route Army, to come out of retirement to assist. Cai has been living in seclusion in Hong Kong, farming for a living, since the failure of the Fujian Incident. Guangdong's move is intended to use his reputation to rally support. However, according to reliable Reuters sources, Cai has no intention of participating because he believes that Guangdong's actions are causing internal conflict rather than resisting Japan. This morning, rumors in Hong Kong claimed that Chen Zhongfu, chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, had arrived in Guangzhou, but reporters in Guangzhou have been unable to confirm this information. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Yongzhou: Two thousand Guangxi troops passed through here yesterday (the 8th) heading north. There are varying accounts of the purpose of the Guangxi army's entry into Hunan, but the provincial troops will not resist them, and the local area remains calm. It is reported that another Guangxi army has entered Hunan from the west, and more are expected to pass through in the coming days. A week ago, news from Guangzhou claimed that the Central Government was massing troops in southern Ting, but based on this area, that is completely inaccurate. (Special Dispatch from the North China Daily News, June 9th)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Expresses Loyalty to the Central Government</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) In response to the Tianjin Municipal Chamber of Commerce's telegram regarding Tianjin's security, Song Zheyuan stated that he has ordered Security Commander Liu Jialuan and Public Security Bureau Chief Sun Weidong to work together to maintain order and will not allow chaos. Although Xiao Zhenying will not return to Tianjin in the coming days, everything will be handled by a dedicated person. Song himself and key figures of the 29th Army are loyal to the Central Government and refuse to be manipulated in a staged drama. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shi Jisheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, returned to Tianjin on the 10th after visiting Xiao Zhenying in Ping. On the 11th, he will invite Security Commander Liu Jialuan and Public Security Bureau Chief Sun Weidong to relay orders. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Lieutenant General Tanaka Nobura, Supervisor of the Traffic Department of the Manchukuo government and attached to the Kwantung Army, and Major Masao Yamase of the Kwantung Army visited Nagami Tashiro in Tianjin on the 9th to exchange views. On the morning of the 10th at 9 o'clock, they flew to Ping to visit Song Zheyuan, staying one day before traveling to Tongzhou to visit Yin. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kwantung Army will support the South Manchuria Railway to complete the North China transportation and communication network, centered on Gubeikou, focusing on military transport highways. Tanaka's visit is to negotiate this mission. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Some frustrated warlords and politicians in North China, wanting to take advantage of the troubles in the Southwest to manipulate the political situation, are colluding with the Southwest to the detriment of the Central Government. Everything is brewing, and a certain faction is holding meetings in Tianjin, focusing on this point. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Banks Send Staff to Hunan to Purchase Rice</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong and Provincial banks have allocated 800,000 yuan, sending staff to establish offices in Hunan to specifically handle Xiangtan rice, as Guangzhou's food supply is only sufficient for two months. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Finance Department Sets Maximum Price for Hong Kong Dollars</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Finance Department reported on the 10th that the maximum price for buying and selling Hong Kong dollars should not exceed 720 yuan premium per 1,000 yuan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Chen Zhongfu Resumes Duty Yesterday After Arriving in Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Zhongfu returned to the Political Council on the 10th and resumed his duties. Chen Jitang and Li Zongren hosted a joint banquet in Meihua Village in the evening. After Pan Yizhi's trip to Japan, Chen will continue to be responsible for handling affairs related to Japan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Guangxi Authorities Impose Severe Penalties to Curb Speculation</h3>
<p>Speculators in Guangxi banknotes are sentenced to death; all exchange shops are ordered to close down.</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) A telegram received here today from Wuzhou states that the Guangxi authorities have decided to use severe penalties, including the death penalty, to curb speculation in Guangxi banknotes and have ordered all exchange shops to close. Only the Guangxi Provincial Bank can engage in foreign exchange transactions. At the same time, the Guangdong currency crisis is worsening. When the market opened this morning, prices continued to fall, and it is now 1,801 yuan to convert to 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. Yesterday's closing price was 1,780 yuan to convert to 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Zhu Jingnong and Yi Shuxing Leave Nanjing to Return to Hunan to Report</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jingnong, Director of the Hunan Education Department, and Yi Shuzhu, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, completed their reports in Nanjing on the military and political situation in Hunan Province. At 1:30 PM on the 10th, they took a China Aviation Corporation flight to Hankou, then transferred to Hunan to report to He Jian. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yi Shuzhu, Secretary-General of Hunan Province, and Zhu Jingnong, Director of the Education Department, visited authorities at 6:00 AM on the 10th to report on the current situation in Hunan Province and seek instructions. Foreign dispatches reported that the Guangxi army had occupied Hengyang, but certain sources stated that this was not true. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Jian, Chairman of Hunan Province, sent a telegram to Nanjing on the night of the 8th, reporting that after the Guangxi army arrived in Yongzhou and Chenzhou, there had been no further action. His troops were ordered to retreat completely first and no incidents had occurred. The telegram did not mention the Guangxi army's concentration in Qiyang. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General in Guangdong, Kawaai, Visits Chen and Issues Warning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Allied News Agency's dispatch from Guangzhou, Kawaai, the Japanese Consul General in Guangdong, issued a warning to Chen Jitang on the 8th, stating that Japan has no intention of interfering in China's internal war and will strictly maintain a neutral attitude towards this Southwest campaign against the Central Government. However, the Guangdong government and military authorities should not excessively stimulate public organizations by using anti-Japanese rhetoric as propaganda to avoid unfortunate incidents. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attaché Kita Arrives in Nanjing; Visits He Yingqin and Zhang Qun</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Major General Kita Seiichi, the Army Attaché of the Japanese Embassy, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 10th. Staff from the Japanese Embassy and Consulate in Nanjing met him at the station. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, Kita, accompanied by Deputy Attaché Amemiya, paid a visit to He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs. At 4:30 PM, he visited Zhang Qun, Minister of Foreign Affairs. Both visits were routine courtesy calls. According to Kita's statement to the Central News Agency, Japan attaches great importance to the military actions of the Guangdong and Guangxi armies and may make a statement soon. When asked about Japan selling arms to Guangxi Province, Kita did not deny it, saying that it was a normal commercial transaction and anyone could buy them. However, he claimed not to know about the sale of these arms on credit. He also said that there would be no incidents in North China recently. Finally, he said he would stay in Nanjing for a few days, intending to visit Foreign Minister Zhang again on the afternoon of the 11th and also visit other officials. It is reported that Kita did not get to meet President Chiang during his last visit to Nanjing and intends to request a meeting this time to express his respect. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Yang Dezhao Visits He Yingqin and Others in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Dezhao visited He Yingqin, Cheng Qian, Tang Shengzhi, and others on the morning of the 10th to report on the recent situation in Guangdong. According to the office, Yang will telegram Guangdong to report after visiting President Chiang and will await a reply from Guangdong before visiting President Chiang again.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang, accompanied by Li Tiancai, Director of the Adjutant's Office, arrived in Nanjing by plane from Shaanxi at 11:30 AM on the 10th to report to President Chiang on the suppression of bandits in the Northwest. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>President Chiang Telegraphed Chen Jitang Again, Ordering the Prompt Withdrawal of the Advance Troops of Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Leaving a Glimmer of Hope for the Nation, Stabilizing the Situation from Suspicion to Peace</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Chiang sent a Yang (7th) telegram in reply to Chen Jitang. Because he has not yet received a reply, he sent another telegram to Chen on the 10th: Guangzhou Director Chen Bonan, Greetings. Confidential. The Yang telegram should have arrived, and I am very concerned that I have not received a clear reply. The Central Executive Committee's telegram requesting strict restraint on free movement by subordinate troops should also have arrived. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee has been scheduled to be held within a month, and everything should be decided by the Party Council. Our national soldiers are subject to the command of the Party and the nation and should not act freely, causing greater public anxiety. At a time when the situation in North China is serious, the diplomatic situation is tense, and the whole country is indignant and grieved, I know that you will not bear to take advantage of the nation's crisis and aggravate the national disaster. The Central Government does not believe in rumors, but according to reliable reports from central Hunan, troops from Guangdong and Guangxi entered Yue Chen Yong on the 8th and are now continuing to advance north, which is beyond my dreams and expectations. This is truly the result of my lack of talent and sincerity. I am ashamed and have nowhere to hide. The Central Government has ordered the troops south of Hengzhou to move north in order to avoid conflict and await consultation on a unified plan. It is hoped that all advancing troops of Guangdong and Guangxi will be strictly ordered to stop advancing immediately and return to their original defenses to dispel rumors and unrest. Otherwise, if the highest authorities of the Central Government have already resolved to hold a meeting on a fixed date and sent telegrams to dissuade troops from taking action, but they still cling to their opinions, act freely, and continue without stopping, then people will say that this is not a move by Chinese troops to resist Japan, but a proof of local generals disobeying orders. If the country is not saved and discipline is first undermined, then not only will the generals at the front line responsible for national defense have to worry about attacks from both inside and outside, but it will also cause the people of the whole country to suffer even more pain of fraternal strife amidst worry, fear, and indignation. Looking at the future, how can I bear to see this happen? This move by you must be the result of shallow and flattering men who have devised reckless plans, thinking that under the guise of resisting Japan, crossing the border and dispatching troops can be done with free rein. Those whose private interests cloud their minds are bound to have this absurd idea, but they do not know that the deeper the national crisis, the more accurate the people's understanding. Public hearing and public vision are as clear as a mirror, and truth and falsehood cannot be concealed in the slightest. How can you be deceived by the irresponsible plans of others and stain your past history and achievements? We have shared hardships for a long time, how can we look at each other casually? What my heart considers dangerous, I cannot help but offer sincere and straightforward advice. The nation is in such a state of crisis that even with the will and strength of the entire nation, we are still worried that it will not be enough to survive. If, at this critical juncture of survival, we hasten the disaster of disintegration, what will the world say? You have been in charge of the southern border for a long time, leading Guangdong and Guangxi. Your success or failure is particularly important. It is hoped that you will follow the Central Government's telegram, promptly order the withdrawal of the advancing troops of Guangdong and Guangxi, to clear up the rumors from the outside world and show your sincere patriotism. I ask you to convey my sincere intentions to my good neighbors Jianzai and others. Please leave a glimmer of hope for the nation and restore stability to the overall situation from suspicion and uncertainty. The country is fortunate, Guangdong and Guangxi are fortunate.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>How Can the Authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi Dispel the Doubts of the Nation?</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The news of the unusual movements in Guangdong and Guangxi has been exaggerated and publicized by the Japanese news agency for a week, gathering the deep worries and doubts of the Chinese people. At a time when the situation in North China is tense and the Central Government is striving to cope with it, suddenly raising the banner and deploying troops, while declaring resistance to foreign aggression, are actually driven by domestic conflicts. We do not believe that China still has people who would dare to disregard the importance of unity against foreign aggression and harbor selfish schemes to hasten disaster. However, with conflicting information, worries and doubts cannot be dispelled. Therefore, we raise several points to question the authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi:</p>
<p>First, how can internal conflict be avoided? The troops of Guangdong and Guangxi proclaim external resistance to Japan, but without prior consultation, they advance into Yongzhou and Chenzhou, two key locations in Hunan province, and continue to advance north. It is a fundamental principle that the national troops each have their own defense areas, and should not move or abandon their defensive responsibilities without the supreme military order. If the Hunan provincial troops do not abandon their defensive responsibilities, who will be responsible for the resulting conflict? It has become a consensus that unity against foreign aggression and the avoidance of internal conflict should be enforced. Those who violate this consensus will inevitably be sanctioned. The authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi are undoubtedly aware of this, but they have rashly advanced in this manner. Obstacles are inevitable along the way. In such a situation, how can they avoid the criticism of using resistance to foreign aggression as a pretext for internal conflict?</p>
<p>Second, how can the suspicion of a certain background be dispelled? Recent news reports claim that there are many Japanese officers in the Guangxi army, and that their military equipment is supplied by Japan. It is also claimed that Guangdong and Guangxi have borrowed money from Japan, and that representatives from Guangdong and Guangxi recently went to Changchun. If the authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi fail to reveal the truth to the nation, the people will inevitably suspect that their actions are the opposite of what they advocate. Actions to save the country must rely on public trust and support to succeed. No event has ever succeeded with widespread doubts. How can these doubts be dispelled?</p>
<p>Third, how can the country be prevented from entering a deeper crisis? Recent foreign news reports have indicated that the advocacy and actions of Guangdong and Guangxi lack political responsibility and will only increase China's danger. Judging from the facts, independent action has already undermined military unity. If it further triggers internal problems, it will inevitably damage national strength and provide the Japanese with an opportunity to develop in North China, which will make the North impossible to save. The Japanese seizing the opportunity to intensify their aggression has particularly significant implications for the future. If the authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi carefully consider the difficult circumstances of the country, I know that they will inevitably turn back.</p>
<p>The above issues, which are of the greatest concern, are prompts for the authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi to reflect. If their intentions are truly for the sake of the country and not what others are worried and doubtful about, then the opportunity to explain has not yet been lost. The Central Government has expressed its concern for the opinions of Guangdong and Guangxi and has specifically convened the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to determine and instruct future policies. The opinions of Guangdong and Guangxi can be formally presented for discussion by the entire committee so that the steps to save the country can be unified, the strength of unity and survival can be increased, and the responsibility for discord and disaster can be avoided. The enlightened authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi should think carefully about this.</p>

<p>Long Yun Telegrams Chen, Li, and Bai</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Kunming: It was reported yesterday that the Guangdong and Guangxi armies had entered Hunan province. Long Yun, Chairman of Yunnan Province, specially telegraphed Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi on the 9th to painfully state the national situation, hoping that the generals of Guangdong and Guangxi would be enlightened. The original telegram stated: Guangzhou Brother Chen Bonan, Brother Li Delin, Brother Bai Jiansheng, Greetings. I have read your telegrams carefully and understand everything. At this critical time for North China, your advocacy of resisting Japan and saving the country is overflowing with loyalty and righteousness, which I admire. However, this matter is of great importance and should be consulted and planned first, and actions should be taken after a plan is decided so that things can be accomplished. I heard that Mr. Chiang has already invited you to consult and negotiate. If we can sincerely cooperate in this way, we can unite our will into a fortress and save the country and destroy the bandits. Otherwise, it will give people more excuses and the bandits will be able to take advantage of the opportunity. Looking at the future, there is much worry. I trust you will make a wise decision. Reply. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>He Jian Issues Statement</h3>
<p>His External Policy Aligns With the Central Government</p>
<p>(Changsha) At 10:00 AM on the 10th, He Jian convened a meeting of the entire press community at the Pacification Commissioner's Office, stating that the authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi have actually sent troops to southern Hunan, declaring resistance to Japan, and have sent Li Pinxian to Changsha to explain the Southwest's anti-Japanese stance and seek Hunan's sympathy. Hunan's external policy has always been consistent with the Central Government, so on the current issue of foreign policy, the entire country should be unified and led by the Central Government to ensure unity of spirit and synchronized steps to resist aggression and seek survival. He explained the situation in Hunan to Li in detail and asked him to convey to the Southwest authorities that they should immediately cease military action, otherwise it would only make it difficult for Hunan to deal with and would not achieve the ultimate goal of foreign policy. Although the Guangdong and Guangxi armies have entered Hunan, they should wait quietly for instructions from the Central Government and should not take unexpected actions. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Changsha) At his meeting with the press on the 10th, He Jian stated that the Central Government has ordered the Guangdong and Guangxi armies that have already entered Chenzhou and Qiyang in Hunan province to stop and await orders. He appointed Wang Dongyuan, the dismissed commander, as a senior advisor to the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and Chen Quzhen as the chief consultant. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bishop of London Discusses the Current Situation in China</h3>
<p>(London) The Christian Victorian District Missions Association recently held its annual meeting here. (Note: The Victorian District includes Hong Kong and southern China.) Dr. Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury, gave a speech discussing the current situation in China, stating that in his view, the problems in China were confusing and difficult to investigate. They were like a puzzle, and although one wanted to find a solution, it was ultimately impossible. "What is the relationship between the Central Government of China and Guangdong Province? Several generals in China are clamoring and jumping around, as if they are on a stage, sometimes acting in a tragedy, sometimes acting in a comedy. What exactly is the relationship between these generals? It is difficult to understand the truth of everything. Now, news has come that Guangdong has had a change of heart towards the Central Government, with obvious signs and an urgent crisis. What is the truth of this?" He also said that one of the reasons for China's instability may be that the country has a long culture, and successive generations have not known how to innovate. "When the ancestors of Europeans were still primitive and uncivilized, living with deer and pigs, China already had a brilliant culture, which has been passed down from afar and is still being transmitted. Although the people of China are hardworking, enduring, virtuous, honest, and reliable, these virtues have remained the same from ancient times to the present, so there must be unlimited hope for their future. Even though they are now in a state of hardship, turmoil, and uncertainty, they will one day become a great nation to awaken their new life, and the signs of this are already evident." (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Reuters, the London newspapers of the 6th all carried news of the anti-Japanese sentiment in Guangzhou, with varying degrees of alarm. However, well-informed sources seemed to view this as aimed at internal affairs and not a genuine direct resistance to Japan. The Manchester Guardian stated that the Southwest Political Affairs Council has not been formally recognized as a country or an independent government, so it has no qualification to declare war. However, it is too early to have a clear understanding of the overall situation. In the future, negotiations may be used to make mutual concessions to reach a solution.

<h3>Lee Tsze-ross Meets Japanese Finance Minister: Further Discusses Anglo-Japanese Joint Investment; Declares Increased Chinese Transportation Increases People's Purchasing Power; Japan Hopes to Further Resolve Anglo-Japanese Trade Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Sir Lee Tsze-ross met with Finance Minister Baba at the Finance Minister's official residence at 4:30 PM on the 10th. Based on Sir Lee's China survey, they exchanged opinions on the recent financial and economic situation in China and future issues. The meeting lasted for one and a half hours, adjourning at 6:00 PM. Although the content of the meeting did not touch on any specific issues, Sir Lee spoke about Sino-Japanese cooperation to promote China's transportation development and agricultural progress, as well as investment in China. Finance Minister Baba also stated that while it is necessary to improve transportation, complete railways, and highways, it is also necessary to consider the purchasing power of the people, especially the situation of Chinese farmers. Although investment is extremely difficult, material investment seems feasible. In short, it is the common goal of both Britain and Japan to hope for China's development, so they will spare no effort to assist and develop China, and so on. (10th, Allied Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sir Lee Tsze-ross is scheduled to meet Finance Minister Baba at the Finance Minister's official residence at 4:30 PM on the 10th to re-examine Anglo-Japanese cooperation regarding China's economy, and to further inquire about the Japanese financial authorities' policies regarding the recent Anglo-Japanese trade issues involving Australia, India, and Egypt, and to frankly exchange opinions. However, Finance Minister Baba will only listen to Mr. Lee Tsze-ross's understanding and views on China's financial economy. Regarding Japan's attitude, because former Finance Minister Takahashi had met with Mr. Ross, the world mistakenly spread that an understanding had been reached regarding Sino-Japanese economic issues. Finance Minister Baba is taking the most cautious approach in light of this precedent. If Mr. Ross's understanding of the special relationship between Sino-Japanese finance and economy is erroneous, it will be corrected, and Japan's special position will be clarified. At the same time, regarding financial assistance to China and the necessity of Anglo-Japanese coordination, it must be limited to theoretical discussions. (10th, Allied Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When Foreign Minister Arita and Lee Tsze-ross had a conversation, they touched upon the issue of adjusting Anglo-Japanese trade relations in the world market. Therefore, in order to quickly resolve this issue, Foreign Minister Arita ordered Commercial Counselor Matsuyama of the embassy in the UK, who was returning home, to quickly return to his post. He is scheduled to take the Chichibu Maru from Yokohama on the 10th, via the United States to London. For the sake of Japan's survival and economic development, Mr. Matsuyama will request from Britain, which owns a quarter of the world's territory, to freely open markets and resources, in order to realize Anglo-Japanese coordination and restore the world economy, so he is quickly returning to his post. (10th, Allied Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of exchanging opinions with Lee Tsze-ross in separate meetings by Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Isoya and Foreign Minister Arita, it was learned that Ross's view on the policy towards China is, in short, that the economic revival of China is the protection of British interests in China, and also the interests of Britain and Japan. Therefore, Britain and Japan must strive to assist China. For this assistance, Japan's cooperation is necessary. Britain cannot carry out activities alone without Japan's understanding. In other words, Britain does not hesitate to recognize Japan's special position in East Asia. Although Ross's views are gradually recognizing Japan's position and his attitude is becoming more compromising, he is eager to ensure his country's economic position, and does not seem to be very concerned about political influence. The Japanese side believes that the relationship between politics and economy is inseparable. Ross's recognition of Japan's special position can be said to be an improvement in his knowledge of East Asia, but if Britain does not realize the necessity of China's political stability from the relationship between politics and economy, there is still a considerable gap in the views of Britain and Japan. It seems that the matter of Anglo-Japanese cooperation in assisting China will be realized (10th, Allied Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Eastern Hebei Smuggled Cigarettes: Seizes Market Share in Four Provinces and Cities; If Tianjin Unified Tax Problem is Not Resolved, Half of Chinese Tobacco Merchants Will Go Bankrupt</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A foreign ronin has established a factory in Eastern Hebei to imitate and manufacture various cigarettes. In the past week, they have been smuggling and selling them to the four provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, and Suiyuan. Taking advantage of the unresolved unified cigarette tax situation, they are seizing market share. About dozens of boxes are shipped in daily, with 50,000 cigarettes per box, selling at a low price of 80 yuan. Sales are very strong, and legitimate goods are being squeezed out. There are more than 30 Shanghai branch offices of Chinese tobacco merchants who have established lawyers. If the unified tax is not resolved in another two weeks, half of them will go bankrupt. British and American tobacco companies sell 3,000 boxes of tobacco in North China per month. In the future, it will be difficult to maintain even half of that. A certain country is also planning to establish a Manchurian Tobacco Company in Tangshan. It is in the planning stage. If it is established, it will be even more unimaginable. (10th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Cigarette merchants are awaiting responses from various authorities regarding the local taxation. The cigarette merchants have not been importing goods for a week. A small number of cigarette merchants advocate complying with the transitional measures of the Unified Tax Bureau of the four provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Suiyuan, paying taxes as usual, so that business will not be affected during the Dragon Boat Festival.

<h3>Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Industry Requests Customs Not to Detain National Cloth</h3>

<h3>Ma Yinchu Talks About Revising the Law on Industry and Commerce Associations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu told reporters on the 10th that the draft amendment to the Law on Industry and Commerce Associations will be discussed with personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the 12th to exchange opinions. After there is a result, industry and commerce groups will be invited to send personnel to the Legislative Yuan for discussion. I believe that the following should be noted in this amendment: 1. How should the staff of the association be punished for violating the law and engaging in malpractice? 2. Government officials are not allowed to engage in commerce. If someone wants to open an industry and commerce company and relies on their power to resist the resolutions of the association, how should they be sanctioned? 3. How should members be punished according to the severity of the circumstances if they do not comply with the resolutions of the association or do not attend various meetings of the association? In short, the whole spirit of this amendment is to change the current laissez-faire approach to an interventionist approach to meet the actual needs of the present. When talking about the unrestricted trading of foreign geese by the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank, Ma said that the so-called unrestricted trading of foreign exchange by the three banks refers to legitimate foreign exchange trading. Ma supports investigating and banning those who use foreign exchange trading for speculation in accordance with the law. However, the safety of legitimate foreign exchange trading must be taken into account during the crackdown, because this matter is of great importance to the development of industry with foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital, and to increasing the foreign exchange funds of the three banks abroad.

<h3>Austrian Prime Minister Addresses 100,000 People; Vows to Fight for Independence; Roman Agreement is Cornerstone of National Policy; German-Austrian Relations to be Brought Back to Normal</h3>
<p>(Vienna) After Prime Minister Schuschnigg met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on the 5th of this month, he has returned to the capital. He delivered a speech at the City Hall this evening, the significance of which is quite profound. This is the first time the Prime Minister has given a public speech since returning from Italy. The speech stated: "The Roman Agreement, signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary in March 1934, remains the cornerstone of Austrian policy." We will never deviate from the south-facing needle set by the late Prime Minister Dollfuss, but the mutual relations between Austria and Germany should also be brought back to normal. "From the standpoint of the Austrian people, we are originally a part of the Germanic ethnic group. There is no reason to build high walls and isolate ourselves. There is one thing we must fight for, that is, Austria's freedom and independence must be respected." The Prime Minister then explained that the boundaries stipulated in the treaty must be observed, and concluded by saying, "Austria belongs to the Austrians." The audience at the meeting cheered loudly when they heard this sentence. The Prime Minister did not mention a word about the restoration issue, but said that Austria must move forward bravely and should not retreat. 100,000 members of the Patriotic Front attended today's grand meeting. The delegation of the Royalist Party was sitting prominently on the right side of the government seat, which was noticed by the general public. Also, although former Deputy Prime Minister Prince Starhemberg did not attend, the Prime Minister praised the Prince in his speech. The audience also cheered and paid tribute when they heard the name of Starhemberg. (9th, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Content of Italian-Austrian Talks: Mussolini Offers Promise; Willing to Ask Germany Not to Interfere in Austrian Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Regarding the content of the talks between Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini the other day, political figures here recently declared that Prime Minister Mussolini promised Prime Minister Schuschnigg that Italy would ask German leader Hitler to solemnly recognize Austria's right to independence and absolutely avoid interfering in Austrian internal affairs. Mussolini himself will guarantee this promise, while Austria should offer some concessions in exchange, that is, all Nazi Party members detained for riots will be pardoned, and German nationals in Austria who can swear allegiance to an independent Austria should also be allowed to participate in politics. Schuschnigg replied that he could only do so after careful consideration. (10th, Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Italian Premier to Shed Three Concurrent Posts; Ciano to Head Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Signs of Progress in International Situation, Major Reshuffle of Envoys Expected, Close Watch on Far East</p>
<p>(Rome) Count Ciano, the Prime Minister Mussolini's son-in-law and former Italian ambassador to China, was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs today. This is a significant position in the Italian government. After Mussolini resigned from his concurrent posts as Minister of Colonies, Foreign Affairs, and Corporations, he immediately assigned the Foreign Affairs portfolio to his son-in-law. Mussolini retains control of the four ministries of Interior, Navy, Army, and Air Force, allowing him to focus on Italian military affairs. Alfieri has succeeded Ciano as Minister of Information and Propaganda, Landini will head the Corporations Ministry, and Lessona will head the Colonies Ministry. The resignation of Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich was also accepted today, and his vacant position will be filled by the current Italian Ambassador to Poland, Bastianini. Upon accepting Suvich's resignation, Mussolini sent him a letter thanking him for his service over the past four years and promising to assign him another important position. The reshuffle of the Italian cabinet had been rumored for days, but its announcement surprised many. Political circles see this as a sign of progress in the international situation, believing that Mussolini would not have relinquished the Foreign Affairs portfolio unless the atmosphere had cleared somewhat. It is widely believed that while Mussolini trusts his son-in-law's abilities, he will still be personally involved in foreign affairs. Ciano's appointment as Foreign Minister is expected to trigger a large-scale reshuffle of Italian ambassadors and ministers in Central Europe, Southern Europe, and the Far East, reflecting Italy's changed policies as a result of the sanctions and counter-sanctions movement. Ciano's new appointment is generally welcomed, as Italy is closely watching the situation in China, and Ciano is well-versed in Far Eastern affairs. It is also said that Italy's occupation of Abyssinia has brought Italy into contact with the Indian Ocean and closer to the Pacific Ocean. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) This cabinet reshuffle is purely a personnel adjustment and has no political significance. Furthermore, British Foreign Secretary Eden is currently 38 years old, while the new Foreign Minister Ciano is only 33 years old. Historically, these are two of the youngest individuals to hold such important diplomatic positions. The various complex and intricate issues arising from the Italo-Ethiopian War will need to be resolved by these two. The tense relationship between Britain and Italy should be resolved by these two, and observers cannot help but notice that they are of similar age and have equal responsibilities. Moreover, the outgoing Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich served for four years, assisting the Prime Minister with great loyalty and sincerity, and his contributions were significant. Upon his resignation, the Prime Minister sent him a letter of consolation. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) King Victor Emmanuel III has appointed Count Ciano as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Landini as Minister of Corporations, and Lessona as Minister of Colonies. It is rumored that Prime Minister Mussolini intends to relinquish his concurrent positions as Minister of Army, Navy, and Air Force, with the current deputies of each ministry being promoted. General Pariani, the Deputy Minister of the Army, will be promoted to Minister of the Army; Admiral Cavagnari, the Deputy Minister of the Navy, will be promoted to Minister of the Navy; and General Valle, the Deputy Minister of Aviation, will be promoted to Minister of Aviation. In addition, it is rumored that Fascist Party Secretary Starace will be reassigned as Minister of the Interior, and that Ambassador to Britain Grandi may also be recalled to Italy. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Italy Demands Lifting of Sanctions; Threatens to Withdraw from the League of Nations</h3>

It is reported that this note was presented verbally to the French Foreign Ministry by the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerruti. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Sanctions Front Showing Signs of Collapse</h3>
<p>South American Countries Eager to Resolve Issue, Council Meeting to Convene on the 26th</p>
<p>(London) It is generally claimed that the South American countries are eager to resolve the sanctions issue as soon as possible and are taking a very firm stance, which they will express to the European powers. Before the Council meeting in May, the Chilean representative sent a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, requesting the lifting of sanctions against Italy. More recently, the Argentine representative requested an early convening of the League of Nations Assembly and proposed that the League of Nations organize a special committee to investigate all issues related to sanctions. All of this is enough to cause the sanctions front to collapse. If this happens, there will be no shortage of excuses to lift sanctions. In addition, the South American countries advocate reforming the League of Nations as a way to resolve the international situation. However, will these countries adhere to the principle of collective security and cooperate with the League of Nations, or will they remain isolated and focus only on Pan-American security? They must make a choice between these two paths. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The current Chairman of the League of Nations Council, British Foreign Secretary Eden, has decided to convene an extraordinary meeting of the Council on the 26th of this month.

Minister of National Defense and Minister of the Army Daladier has been ordered to coordinate the operations of each department to increase efficiency. At the same time, Daladier has also been appointed Chairman of the Supreme War Council, a position previously held exclusively by the French Head of State. The Permanent National Defense Committee of France has now been established and is chaired by the Minister of National Defense. In addition to the Minister of National Defense, the committee also includes the Minister of the Navy, the Minister of the Air Force, General Gamelin, and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

Preliminary work on opening the large naval port of Cape Town has already begun, with one pier costing £5 million. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>New Measures by the French Cabinet; Labor Bill Submitted to the Chamber of Deputies</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies convened at 4:00 PM, and Prime Minister Léon Blum presented several draft laws concerning labor and social issues, requesting:</p>
<p>* Implementation of a 40-hour work week;</p>
<p>* Two weeks of annual vacation with pay for workers;</p>
<p>* Unions to represent workers and sign labor contracts with employers;</p>
<p>* Elimination of the current salary reduction for low-level civil servants whose salaries are extremely meager;</p>
<p>* Elimination of the reduction in benefits for veterans.</p>
<p>Léon Blum also made a brief speech, stating that the labor unrest that had lasted for more than ten days had now been satisfactorily resolved, which was a cause for great joy. The Chamber of Deputies immediately decided to form a special committee of 33 members, including some opposition members, to review the wording of each of these draft laws and submit them for a vote at the end of this week. The Chamber of Deputies then adjourned and is scheduled to reconvene on Thursday. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>People's Livelihood Should Be Considered; Demanding Explanation from the Government on Two Points</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Left Republican group in the Senate held a meeting today. Senator and Chairman Li Yi'an expressed surprise at some of the draft laws proposed by the cabinet (referring to the laws on social and labor issues proposed by Prime Minister Blum), believing that they would increase the cost of goods and the level of people's lives. If so, then the increase in wages for salaried workers would be futile. It was resolved that before the parliamentary vote on these draft laws, the cabinet should first be asked to explain two points:</p>
<p>* If prices rise in the future and exports are halted, what measures does the cabinet intend to take to remedy the situation?</p>
<p>* If French goods do not sell well in the future, leading to factory closures and an increase in unemployment, what measures does the cabinet intend to take to prevent this?</p>
<p>In addition, the group believes that attention should be paid to the fact that the two countries were originally closely related, but due to sanctions, there is some discord. Therefore, they hope that the issue of sanctions against Italy can be resolved quickly. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Agreement Reached; Labor Unrest in Various Industries Gradually Resolved</h3>
<p>(Paris) Labor unrest in various industries has been gradually resolved. Twelve thousand striking food delivery workers in the capital reached an agreement with store owners last night and are expected to return to work today. Employees of insurance companies and employers have also reached a compromise on the terms of resumption of work. Factories in the iron and steel, leather, woodworking, oil refining, and plating industries in the northern districts have all resumed work. Factory owners in the woolen industry in Roubaix have also accepted the workers' demands, and 80,000 workers are scheduled to return to work on Thursday. Ten thousand workers in the underwear industry in Troyes are also expected to return to work today. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although labor unrest in most areas has been resolved due to individual agreements between labor and management, strikes continue to occur in some cities. For example, coal miners in Anzin, transportation, construction, and lead-iron workers in Toulouse, employees of some small department stores in the port of Bordeaux, and 10,000 textile workers in Reims have stopped working. In addition, labor unrest in Maubeuge has spread to the Sambre River basin, where the total number of striking metalworkers has reached as many as 20,000. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Many factories in the capital area and in the provinces, especially in the northeast and central regions, have resumed work. The labor dispute between the Hachette newspaper distribution company in the capital has ended, and all newspapers are being sold as usual. Labor and management in the construction industry are expected to reach a compromise tomorrow and resume work on Thursday morning. Labor and management in various industries in Lille in the north have also begun negotiations, but it is impossible to say at this time when the labor unrest will end. Some specific issues in the metallurgical industry have been resolved, and the only remaining issue is the increase in wages. It is difficult to reach a compromise in the textile industry. Negotiations in other major industries are based on a spirit of compromise, so the situation in each factory is very calm. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The new cabinet is now making every effort to prepare new legislative proposals to improve the living conditions of workers, but the wave of strikes continues to spread. The latest to join the strikes are waiters and workers in pastry shops. Waiters are demanding two hot meals a day, no fines for breaking objects, and not having to polish brassware. Porters are demanding that residents of the building should each have a key to the door to avoid knocking on the door late at night and disturbing the porter's sleep. At the same time, negotiations in the textile and metal industries are still ongoing. These people are not satisfied with the increase in wages of 7% to 15%, and many are demanding an increase of 40%. In the industries where strikers have now returned to work, wages have generally increased by 20% to 35%, causing prices to rise everywhere. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>British, American, and French Consuls General in Shenyang Request Leave to Return Home One After Another</h3>
<p>Each Bearing Important Political Missions</p>
<p>(Changchun) Since Japan's invasion and occupation, Manchuria's commercial market has been monopolized, and the commerce of Britain, America, and France has been squeezed out. It is reported that the British, American, and French Consuls General in Shenyang have recently requested leave to return to their respective countries one after another. According to well-informed sources, the three Consuls General held meetings in a certain place many times before leaving Shenyang, and engaged in intense debates on issues such as Japanese-Soviet relations and German-"Manchukuo" trade. The purpose of this move is that Britain and the United States may want to probe the extent to which France may assist the Soviet Union and strengthen its Far Eastern policy, while France wants to explore the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards German-puppet trade. Now that the three have returned to their countries one after another, it is to report to their respective governments on the progress of their probes and to propose future countermeasures.

<h3>Gastric Spasms and Stomach Bleeding</h3>
<p>Gastric spasm, commonly known as stomach ache, is an extremely common ailment. Its symptoms include spasmodic pain in the stomach, which may even extend to the chest, back, and lower abdomen, and is quite dangerous. Stomach bleeding differs from hemoptysis; stomach blood is not as bright red as lung blood, but rather dark-colored, foul blood. Patients experience a sensation of fullness and severe burning in the stomach, and the stomach feels agitated and uneasy. The mortality rate is very high.</p>
<p>The treatment for stomach ache, in addition to taking specialized medication, includes warm compresses, applying hot, damp cloths to the chest. As for stomach bleeding, the body must be absolutely still, with an ice pack applied to the stomach, and fasting for two or three days. In addition, select and take an effective preparation of "Strong Stomach Essence" to constrict stomach blood vessels and enhance stomach function, which will also correct the nerves. In this way, the stomach ache will naturally disappear and the bleeding will stop. Many clinicians have experienced that "Strong Stomach Essence" effectively treats all acute and chronic stomach ailments, such as acid reflux and belching, heartburn and nausea, aversion to food, abdominal distension, or intermittent, hidden pain, constipation, or diarrhea, excessive gas in the intestines and flatulence, malnutrition, and thinness. It is also effective for beriberi and weakness, as this product contains vitamin B. It is a wonderful product for year-round health maintenance, for the elderly with constipation, and for smokers quitting smoking. Furthermore, because it is rich in spleen essence, it excels at strengthening and replenishing the brain and blood, stimulating a strong appetite, and enhancing the stomach's ability to digest. The amount of food consumed increases significantly. "Strong Stomach Essence" is available at major pharmacies in Shanghai and other cities.</p>
<h3>Women's Method for Regulating Menstruation, Nourishing the Brain, and Reversing Aging</h3>
<p>Women's physiology differs from men's, and their adolescence is relatively shorter. After a certain age, signs of aging appear. The cause is due to the disappearance of internal secretions from the ovarian fluid, which gradually weakens the vitality of cells throughout the body. As a result, the complexion withers, the hair becomes yellow or white easily, hair falls out, essence decreases, fatigue sets in, menstruation becomes irregular, either early or late, thinking becomes sluggish, the heart palpitates, insomnia, forgetfulness, infertility, leucorrhea, dizziness, and headaches all lead to extreme weakness.</p>
<p>If ovarian function is remodeled and its internal secretions are stimulated, then the root cause of the disease is removed, and all symptoms disappear. "Female Beauty Supplement" is a medicine with this function. After taking it, because the cells receive sufficient nutrition, the function of the whole body becomes active, the skin becomes moist, the complexion becomes rosy, and the muscles become delicate. Although aging, it can restore youth. Those parts of the body that are underdeveloped, such as withered breasts, can be invigorated to grow, become full and erect. It can also increase breast milk production after childbirth. Because it is good at stimulating ovarian secretion, it is quick to achieve remarkable results for irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, insomnia and palpitations due to nervous breakdown, forgetfulness, infertility, sore and weak waist and legs, and easy hair loss, allowing the body to enjoy health and strength forever.</p>
<h3>Attention to Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhou Youren</p>
<p>The treatment of gonorrhea differs from ordinary diseases and other ailments, as the latter can often be cured within a certain short period. However, gonorrhea, if not treated continuously for a long time, will relapse with a single intercourse. Therefore, during the treatment period, one must listen to the doctor's instructions and be careful in preserving one's health. Moreover, taking medication requires perseverance, not a fickle approach. The market often boasts that gonorrhea medications are effective in an hour and eradicate the root in two boxes, which deceives patients and leads to a surge in complications, which is lamentable. Since the French Phalangfu Pharmaceutical Factory created "Kelinong," a sacred medicine for expelling gonorrhea, its rapid efficacy has been truly unexpected. This is because it is formulated with antitoxins from animal bile. This is a type of protein that invigorates the body's natural resistance, enabling the complete annihilation of gonococci, leaving none behind. From then on, it becomes extinct, and all symptoms such as urethral discharge, inflammation, pain, and pyuria are completely cured. However, it should be noted that this medicine has been tested by famous doctors and scholars, who stated that it needs to be taken for about half a dozen doses to achieve the purpose of cure. Treating illness is not child's play. It is definitely not advisable to mix this product with other drugs. Moreover, animal experiments have guaranteed that there are absolutely no harsh side effects. Taking it will not harm the stomach and intestines, nor will it cause any irritation. However, when purchasing, one should not blindly trust others and be deceived by inferior products of counterfeit brands, which may lead to accidental purchase and endanger one's life. It is essential to recognize the three characters "Kelinong" so that you can take it with peace of mind. In recent years, this agent has been renowned in society as the most effective for all acute and chronic gonorrhea, and complications such as testicular, prostate, and arthritis. Therefore, all European countries wholeheartedly welcome the import of this agent.</p>
<p>Do you suffer from neurasthenia? Please take "Buti Kang"!</p>
<p>The success of a person's career depends on a quick mind, which gives us the right to exist. However, due to various reasons, this quick mind cannot be maintained for long. As a result, not only is the quick mind lost, but also the health of the whole body is reduced to nothing. From the practical observation of various people, the reason why many people become mentally dull and neurasthenic is due to indiscriminate masturbation during the adolescence or early marriage, and excessive sexual activity, which damages the youth glands midway, resulting in incomplete development of reproductive function, shortness like a child, or nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and insufficient erection strength. Palpitation is accelerated, headache and insomnia, memory and recall are significantly reduced. Vision is easily fatigued. Every time you read books and newspapers, you feel dizzy. You feel dull and easy to get angry. Therefore, there is no hope of success in all professions. And the great happiness of life is also lost, such as poor emotional relationships between couples, infertility after long marriage, and despair of offspring.</p>
<p>The most appropriate medicine to treat this kind of sexual neurasthenia can be purchased from major pharmacies to take "Buti Kang," which can be cured. This medicine is made by extracting hormones from the testicles of brave and active animals using new scientific methods. After taking it, it first enters the blood, and then is transported by the blood to the youth glands lacking hormones, so that it can exert a vigorous reproductive function. The whole body is nourished by it, turning weakness into strength. All sexual neurasthenia, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, weak erection, weakened memory, etc., can be effective quickly after taking "Buti Kang."</p>
<h3>Causes and Treatment of Chronic Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>The reason why chronic leukorrhea is difficult to cure is simply because the gonococci invade the interior, making it difficult to track and destroy them. Therefore, it recurs repeatedly and becomes deeper and deeper. If appropriate treatment is not given, there may be no hope of complete cure in the end. What is even more frightening is the transmission of this virus to one's wife, resulting in persistent leukorrhea with pus and blood, and inducing menstrual difficulties. This is an even worse consequence.</p>
<p>Generally, during the acute phase of gonorrhea, most of it is in the anterior urethra. The tissue of the anterior urethra is relatively simple, so it is easy to eradicate. However, once it becomes chronic, the gonococci enter the posterior urethra from the anterior urethra. Once the gonococci enter the posterior urethra, there are many routes of invasion, such as the prostate, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and testicles, which are easily attacked by the gonococci. At the same time, several or more complications can occur, which is truly unpredictable and difficult to track and destroy, just like fleeing bandits who are not easy to capture all of them. Those who have had gonorrhea for many years mostly experience testicular swelling and pain, difficulty in ejaculation, and urethral discharge in the morning. This is a complication of orchitis and vas deferens inflammation. It is advisable to take "Kelinong" to eliminate gonococci and relieve pain and reduce swelling. After taking it for about four or five weeks, the gonococci can be cured. Even after blood serum examination, there should be no gonococcal reaction. However, this disease is often transmitted to one's wife, so the wife also suffers from leukorrhea. The local area is stimulated by pus, which affects urination, and the lower abdomen is full and uncomfortable. "Kelinong" should also be taken internally, and "Ka Er Xuedi Vaginal Tablets" should be used externally to treat vaginal discharge. Internal and external treatment will cure completely within three or four weeks.</p>
<h3>Recent Theories on Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is a disease that is spreading everywhere in the world today. Pulmonary diseases are widely spread in densely populated urban areas, while the occurrence of pulmonary diseases is not easy to see in poor rural areas. Urban areas occupied by tuberculosis are called tuberculosis-domesticated areas, and areas where tuberculosis does not occur are called tuberculosis-virgin areas. Once the latter is invaded by tuberculosis bacteria, it spreads rapidly. The former, when infected with tuberculosis bacteria, often becomes chronic. But what we should pay attention to is the so-called cold. When examining the medicine for colds, the first thing that should be recommended is "Bufei Naer" produced by the French Phalangfu Pharmaceutical Factory, because this medicine has great effects such as regulating the body temperature center and removing phlegm and relieving cough. It has always received special merits in clinical experiments. It is also used to treat cough, hemoptysis, sputum, chest pain, pale skin, irritability, malnutrition, lack of sleep, night sweats, flushed face, anemia, and weight loss in the first, second and third stages of pulmonary tuberculosis. , etc., can be completely cured in about two weeks to six weeks, and this is certified by famous doctors. It also has miraculous effects when used to treat pertussis, senile asthma or chronic bronchitis. In addition, whenever a patient is extremely weak, such as insomnia, palpitations, and kidney deficiency in men, and irregular menstruation in women, you can take "Buti Kang" for men and "Bu Nv Rong" for women to boost your physical strength at the same time, and it will be easy to recover. As for the medicine "Bufei Naer", you can buy it from nearby pharmacies. Because this medicine is sold in pharmacies everywhere.</p>
<h3>US Republican Convention: Landon and Borah Compete Fiercely</h3>
<p>More than 1,000 representatives have a serious attitude. Landon is the most promising candidate for president.</p>
<p>Cleveland - The Republican National Convention opened here at 11:43 this morning. Party Chairman Fry held the first meeting and nominated Senator Steiwell as temporary chairman. The meeting adjourned at 12:33 and reopened at 8:00 in the evening. At that time, the temporary chairman will deliver a speech on the purpose of the meeting. Today's first meeting lacked enthusiasm. Party members were all serious. The meeting place was the lecture hall in this city. There were many well-known figures on the podium, such as Senator Vandenberg, former Senator Bemo Moses, former Secretary of the Treasury Mills, former Senator Leiter, conservative leader and former Senator Bingham, Congressman Martin, and former Governor Allen of Kansas. However, liberal leader Senator Borah was absent. Because Borah saw that Governor Landon of Kansas had a great hope of being elected as the next presidential candidate, he summoned representatives from Wisconsin in the hotel to discuss coping strategies. The meeting place was full of leaders from Landon's side. His propaganda officer Hamilton claimed that Landon could be elected in the first vote. However, other supporters said that they were prepared to make slight concessions to Borah's proposal. Now, Borah's request seems to make the Landon faction the most uneasy. On the one hand, various permissions have been granted to representatives of the eastern states, while Borah insists on implementing a purge and rejuvenation movement within 48 hours. He is very dissatisfied with Landon's tendency to compromise. Representatives from states such as New York and California seemed to be trying to pressure Landon today to overturn Borah's request. The Associated Press held an informal vote today, and the results are as follows:</p>
<p>Landon: 468 votes</p>
<p>Borah: 115 votes</p>
<p>Knox (Chicago publisher): 90 votes</p>
<p>Taft (son of former president): 47 votes</p>
<p>Vandenberg (Senator): 45 votes</p>
<p>Meekin (Judge): 23 votes</p>
<p>Dickinson (Senator): 22 votes</p>
<p>Nice (Governor of Maryland): 16 votes</p>
<p>Undecided: 177 votes</p>
<p>The conference has a total of 1,003 representatives. To be nominated as a candidate, one must have 502 votes. It is difficult to predict the vice presidential candidate today. The most promising candidate is the temporary chairman Steiwell. Judging from today's situation, Landon has a good chance of succeeding in the first vote. However, if three or four votes cannot obtain a majority, it may become a stalemate. Landon's side is very worried that Borah will see that the party's platform on issues such as currency, diplomacy, and industrial patents cannot fully satisfy him, and he will fight for principles. Borah is good at giving speeches and can move the audience. Landon will be greatly hindered. Once Landon is defeated, Vandenberg is quite hopeful. (9th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Cleveland - The Republican National Convention opened here at 10 o'clock last night. Senator Steiwell from Oregon delivered an opening speech. The speech was very long, and its general meaning advocated that the United States should adopt an isolationist policy and strictly abide by it in politics, economy, spirit, and society. He also fiercely attacked President Roosevelt, saying that based on patriotism, the President and his political allies should be forced to step down, especially Roosevelt, who must be regarded as a "foreign person in disguise" rather than an American. He also said that once the Republican Party is in power, it must abolish the current "New Deal" and replace it with "American Politics" in order to communicate the opinions of the Democratic and Republican parties without any barriers. The so-called "New Deal" has many malpractices. If we want to remedy it and revitalize it, the various principles contained in "American Politics" must be implemented. The main points of these principles are: free competition in all industries and not be restrained, just like marching an army; artificial bureaucratic politics must be eliminated; an isolationist policy must be adopted internationally; and new protectionism must be implemented in tariffs. "Thanks to its geographical location, the United States does not need to rely on other countries, which is a blessing from heaven. The government must use this special situation and avoid involvement in the affairs of other countries. This is the government's duty to the people," he said. After the speech, the representatives followed the usual practice of parading in the meeting place in teams, with music and cheers for the important party figures one by one. The meeting adjourned at midnight. The conference is now scheduled to continue this afternoon, and it is generally expected that important decisions can be made by evening. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Maintains Silence on Diplomacy; Japanese Consulate General in Tianjin Strengthens Organization; Kuwashima Arrives in Tianjin to Convey Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Tianjin Gradually Returns to Calm; Authorities Strive to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: A week ago, the bombing of the Beining Railway caused unrest in Tianjin and Beijing, and rumors spread like wildfire. At the same time, personnel changes in a section of Hebei and Chahar were also rumored, causing widespread anxiety. By the end of last week, the rumors had gradually subsided and people's minds had calmed down as the authorities maintained calm and there were no diplomatic incidents. Although the Japanese side has not formally stated that it does not attach importance to the railway bombing incident, according to a spokesperson from the Japanese military headquarters, investigating the background is extremely difficult. Before a full understanding is reached, no statement will be made, so this matter will be delayed for a long time and will likely fade away. The Japanese military headquarters has adopted Huaibei diplomatic policies ever since Tashiro assumed his post in the middle of last month. However, on Wednesday, the third day of last week, Tashiro acted on his own initiative and convened a meeting of staff officers of the Japanese garrison, at which three important decisions were made: (1) To encourage the officers and take responsibility for advancing and completing the important mission of the garrison, based on the military's ironclad principles for North China. (2) To implement the new line of co-existence and co-prosperity in accordance with the firm instructions of the Empire. (3) To closely liaise with and support the new Consul General, Tajiri Aiyi, of the Tianjin Consulate General in accordance with the military's intentions and to give full play to his aggressive diplomatic skills. Tajiri was appointed to Tianjin with the rank of First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China and as concurrently acting Consul General of Tianjin, and was also designated as the top-ranking official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The purpose of this assignment is to integrate the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policies with the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters and to realize what is called "diplomatic unity." The Tianjin Consulate General has strengthened its organization since June 10th to facilitate liaison with the Japanese military headquarters. Kuwashima, the Director-General of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acting on the orders of the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, will arrive in Tianjin on the 11th after meeting with the leaders of the Japanese Kwantung Army in the Northeast to give instructions and convey the unified diplomatic policy. Currently, if the Hebei-Chahar authorities do not request negotiations on the Hebei and Chahar matters, the Japanese side will temporarily maintain a cool attitude and will not begin its direct policy until the military and consulate are in seamless contact. Currently, there are still many rumors in Tianjin,传闻相传前任苏皖巡使某、前任第五路军总指挥某, it is rumored that a certain former Superintendent of Jiangsu and Anhui and a certain former Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army are doing their best to recruit die-hard followers and form them into plainclothes teams, which have already obtained several thousand people, who are all lurking in the suburbs of Tianjin and in a certain concession, and will take actions unfavorable to the overall situation in Hebei and Chahar. Bai Jianwu, who caused trouble in Fengtai on the outskirts of Beijing last year, is also active in this group. Although the matter has not yet been launched, there are also many people who hope for extravagant things. A certain Chairman, a certain Mayor, a certain Chief of Public Security, and a certain Salt Commissioner of Changlu, all regard themselves as central figures in the future situation. Fearing that the Tianjin's security will become chaotic, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council has ordered the Security Commander Liu Jialuan to properly plan prevention methods and has ordered Liu to concurrently serve as the Director of the Hebei Province Wuhe Water Police Bureau and the Maritime Police Bureau, unifying the command of the water and land military police, and strictly deploying forces inside and outside the city, which is equivalent to a temporary garrison commander. On Thursday, Liu, acting Security Commander, convened Sun Weidong, Director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, as well as company commanders and above of the Security Force, platoon leaders and above of the garrison troops, and military and police officers to discuss thorough defense measures. From that day on, they have focused their efforts on monitoring the activities of a certain inspecting envoy and a certain commander-in-chief in a certain concession. Liu Jialuan told the press that although there are many rumors in the city, they will not affect security. He has agreed with Sun Weidong, Director of the Law Enforcement Bureau, to do everything possible to maintain security and not allow a few people to harbor evil intentions and plot disturbances. If it is absolutely necessary, they will not hesitate to make major sacrifices. As for diplomacy, that is a separate matter and is not within his responsibility, and the highest authorities will be responsible for it. (8th)</p>
<h3>After Li Shengda Was Assassinated, His Wife and Son Both Died for Him; On the Seventh Night After Li's Death, His Wife and Son Died One After Another After Lighting Paper Offerings</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Li Shengda, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and Commander of the 19th Army, was assassinated on the 31st of last month in Lishi. After hearing the news at her residence in the provincial capital, his wife immediately took a car to visit him. When she arrived in Fenyang, she learned the definite news of Li's death and immediately fainted. It took a great deal of effort from the accompanying staff to revive her, and she immediately returned to the provincial capital by the same car. Li's wife was overwhelmed with grief and determined to die. In her sorrow, she repeatedly told people that once the Commander's coffin returned to Bing and arrangements were made for his funeral, she would make her intentions clear. For several days, she had been weeping all day long and had stopped eating and drinking. Although relatives and friends had tried to persuade her in every way, they were unable to change her mind. The family had no choice but to take extra care to prevent accidents. Until the afternoon of the 5th of this month, she had only consumed half a bowl of rice soup.</p>
<p>Light Rain Descends; The Course of Events</p>
<p>The 5th was the seventh day after Li's death, and relatives and friends came to mourn in an endless stream. Around 10:00 PM, a light rain suddenly began to fall. The people in charge of the household, fearing that a heavy rain would come soon, gathered the wreaths and flower arrangements in the courtyard and moved them to the corridor outside the mourning hall. Li's coffin, after being transported back from Lishi, was placed in the north hall of the west courtyard of the residence. The east and west rooms of the hall were Li's inner chambers during his lifetime. There was another eaves corridor outside the hall. Around 12:00 AM that night, just as the monks and Taoists were chanting scriptures and burning paper offerings, there was a slight breeze, which caused sparks to fly high. Due to carelessness, the flower arrangements that had been moved to the front of the corridor were ignited. The people in charge immediately tried their best to put out the fire.</p>
<p>Sitting Still, Unwavering in Her Determination to Die</p>
<p>At that time, Li's wife and her biological eldest son, Wenlong, were mourning in the west room of the north hall. Seeing the fire raging in the room, they immediately led the son to the mourning hall to call for help. Their attitude was calm and they showed no panic. The son, only seven years old, was at his mother's side. The wife shouted to quickly take my son out, and those around her braved the fire to enter and first carried the son out. They then re-entered to rescue the wife. At this time, the wife closed her eyes and shouted loudly, "My son has been taken out, don't worry about me!" This delayed the rescue. Those around her were extremely alarmed and pulled her out, but the wife was determined not to move. She struggled and plunged into the fire, holding the threshold firmly with her hands. For a time, she could not be pulled out. By the time everyone struggled to free her, the wife was already on her last breath. Because the time was too long, the son was also severely burned. That night, they were sent to the Chuanzhi Hospital by car. By 10:00 AM on the morning of the 6th, the wife was beyond saving and passed away.</p>
<p>Braving the Fire to Rescue the Coffin</p>
<p>The firefighters desperately rescued the wife and quickly braved the fire to rescue Li's coffin. Fortunately, the north hall had windows opening on the other side, and there was a small open space outside the windows. Everyone entered the hall and lifted the coffin out through the windows and placed it on the ground. At this time, the fire was raging, threatening to spread like wildfire. Fortunately, the rescue efforts were effective in extinguishing the fire outside the courtyard. As for the fire inside the house (i.e., inside the north hall mourning hall), only a part of the paper-covered ceiling was burned from the doorway to the back windows, and the rest was unaffected. There was no other damage. According to eyewitnesses, at that time, everyone was in a panic. After moving Li's coffin out, they first extinguished the fire in the courtyard. As for the fire inside the house, it was soon extinguished on its own. In the darkness, it seemed that there was a divine presence. It was indeed a great stroke of luck amidst misfortune. The fire outside the courtyard was not completely extinguished until around 1:00 or 2:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Wife is Dressed for Burial; The Son is in a Coma</p>
<p>After the fire broke out, Feng Pengzhu, the Adjutant of the Pacification Headquarters, Rong Honglu, the Commander of the Garrison, and Cheng Shurong, the Director of Public Security, rushed to direct the firefighting. At the same time, they also telephoned Yan Xishan to report the situation. Yan, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered doctors from the Chuanzhi Hospital to rush to treat the injured. After Li's wife and son were admitted to the hospital, emergency surgery was performed. However, the wife and son's whole bodies were severely burned, and their skin and flesh were completely ulcerated. Their body temperatures dropped to the lowest levels. Although every effort was made to save them, the results were minimal. Li's wife died at the hospital at 10:00 AM on the 6th, and the son died at the hospital at 4:00 PM. After Li's wife died, Yan was extremely saddened by her martyrdom. He immediately ordered that a coffin made of Phoebe zhennan wood be purchased and that the body be dressed for burial at the hospital. The coffin was transported to Li's residence on the afternoon of the 6th. Yan also sent Division Commander Wang Jingguo to inspect the Li residence and comfort the family.</p>
<p>Inspecting the Tragic Scene at the Li Residence</p>
<p>The reporter went to the Li residence on the morning of the 6th to inspect the scene. Li's coffin was still placed in the middle of the north hall. Inside the north hall, except for the ceiling, which was partially burned, the traces of the fire outside the courtyard were extremely widespread. The pillars in front of the north hall corridor, the east and west rooms, and the sky canopy in the courtyard were all burned to a charred black. However, all four houses were unharmed. From this, it can be seen that the rescue efforts were effective. It was reported that in addition to the efforts of the family's stable hands, the Public Security Bureau's fire brigade also rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. Li's wife, Wang, was 30 years old and from Jincheng. She had been with Commander Li for more than ten years, and their relationship was extremely close. The wife had two sons. The eldest son, Wenlong, was only seven years old and studied at the Kindergarten of the National Teachers' Affiliated Elementary School. The other son was only two years old and was cared for by a nanny. When the reporter left the Li residence after the inspection, he saw the nanny leading him outside the door, playing innocently and oblivious to what had happened. Seeing this situation and the wife's martyrdom, one could not help but be moved to tears. (June 6th)</p>
<h3>Rice Shortage in Northern Fujian; Once a Rice-Producing Area, It Now Needs Foreign Rice to Alleviate the Situation</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Northern Fujian was originally a rice-producing area. In recent years, due to the disturbances caused by the Red Bandits, farmers have fled and fields have been abandoned, resulting in a situation where areas that used to transport rice to Fuzhou for sale now have to purchase foreign rice from Fuzhou to alleviate the situation. The decline of the rural economy is evident. Since the suppression of the Red disaster the year before last, farmers have gradually returned and engaged in farming, and the food supply has been somewhat self-sufficient. However, due to poor harvests last autumn, there was not much rice in storage, and a famine occurred in the summer of this year. In the past ten days or so, rice prices in Nanping, Jian'ou, Pucheng, Chong'an, Jiangle, and Shunchang counties have soared, increasing from nine yuan per stone to twelve yuan, and they continue to rise. The county governments and chambers of commerce have sent telegrams to the provincial government requesting relief. The provincial government has telegraphed Shanghai, requesting that a large batch of sea rice be transported to Fujian to be transshipped to northern Fujian. At the same time, more than 400 packages of rice stored in the provincial capital were transported to Yanping for relief. However, since the end of spring, the provincial capital has experienced two floods, and low-lying fields have been submerged, resulting in significant losses of seedlings. Farmers are currently sorting things out, and about three-tenths of the seedlings will rot. At this time of year, when the new crop is not yet available, the local rice production in various townships is already insufficient. Moreover, with the supply from northern Fujian cut off, the price of rice has also increased from ten yuan to eleven yuan per stone in the provincial capital. Fortunately, the counties of Ningde, Fu'an, and Xiapu in eastern Fujian had very good harvests last autumn and still have surplus rice this summer. Recently, rice merchants Rongfeng and Qinghe and other firms have successively requested the county chambers of commerce to forward requests to the Minhou County Government for the issuance of passports to facilitate the purchase and transportation of rice to the province for relief. To date, many days have passed, but no passports have been issued, and the rice merchants have not been able to set out. However, a batch of sea rice has arrived, which has provided some assistance. Therefore, the price of rice has remained around eleven yuan and has not continued to increase. (June 6th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Actively Trains Administrative Personnel</h3>
<p>Plans to Establish an Administrative Personnel Training Institute; Graduates Will Be Assigned to Assist County Magistrates</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The implementation of Guangdong's first three-year plan was completed at the end of the 24th year, and it has been quite successful. However, due to financial difficulties in various counties, it was not fully implemented. In order to continue to complete the plan, the authorities have drafted a second three-year administrative plan, selecting essential parts of the previous plan that were not implemented and incorporating considerations of the future environment in order to put politics on the right track and allow the people to rest and recuperate. The second plan has been drafted by various departments and submitted to the provincial government. After the directors of the departments return from inspecting the various counties, they will convene a meeting to make a decision so that the plan can be implemented as soon as possible on July 1st of this year. However, it is reported that the authorities believe that good government lies not in many words but in how it is implemented. However, even with a plan, if those who implement it do not work hard and simply go through the motions, it is all for naught. Since the county is an autonomous unit, the county magistrate's responsibilities are important, and it is appropriate to select talent, but it is also essential to have people to assist them. Therefore, the authorities, recognizing this, are currently planning to establish a provincial administrative personnel training institute (the name has not been fully decided). It will recruit students who have graduated from the advanced group of the first phase of the military academy's political advanced training program and students who have graduated from the special group and have not been assigned. They will be given further training to instill them with various types of administrative knowledge. The number of students is planned to be 100. After graduation, each county government will assign one student to assist the county magistrate in handling administrative affairs and implementing the second three-year administrative plan, thereby increasing the efficiency of administration. This matter is currently being planned. Once it is submitted to and passed by the Provincial Affairs Conference and approved by the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, it can be implemented as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Set a Deadline for River Dredging</h3>
<p>The dredging of rivers in various districts of the county by requisitioning labor was previously ordered by the Construction Department to be carried out in accordance with the established business methods. Now, the department has ordered that all river courses that have not been dredged by the end of the year must be completed by the end of this month. The county government has ordered each district to complete all river courses that have not been completed by the 15th of the month and to report them immediately to be forwarded to the department for statistics.</p>
<h3>Suzhou The Rent Riot Has Not Yet Ended</h3>
<p>Residents of Xialian Township, Loumenwai, Xietang Town, rioted over rent and destroyed seven houses of the baojia heads in Yu Lane. Afterwards, they accused the security team of drowning a child. Hundreds of people flocked to Xietang Town and clashed with the security team. The child's body was inspected in the countryside on the morning of the 10th by Zhang Minsheng, a prosecutor from the local court, who confirmed that the child had drowned in the river. According to the statement from Zhu Zhu, a relative of the deceased, the deceased was her granddaughter, Zhu Ada, six years old. On the afternoon of the 8th, the security team went to Yu Lane to arrest people. Zhu, along with Li Shenshi and two others, were taken away by the team. At that time, Ada was carried on Zhu's back and was pushed into the river by a security team member, etc. It is now reported that the villagers are generally dissatisfied with this. On the afternoon of the 9th, the city specially dispatched additional security teams to Xietang Town to increase defenses, and put up foot patrols in the evening. Xietang Elementary School was closed for one day that day, and the situation remains serious.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Merchants and Residents Seize Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Tong Maoyu Cargo Firm, located at the entrance of Jiangyin Lane, Beithang, is opened by Zhou Binrong and is quite prosperous. Yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM, more than 40 members of the anti-smuggling team organized by merchants and residents of Beithang, together with police officer Zhong Zhixiang of the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau and Wu Rongmo of the First Detachment of the 4th Regiment, went to the firm to search for smuggled goods. As a result, they found ten boxes of salmon (commonly known as tung oil fish), which were immediately sent to the county party headquarters for disposition. Sun Xiangfeng, the party committee member, received them and ordered the merchants and residents to return to their homes. He also telegraphed the county magistrate to discuss the disposal methods. However, according to the firm, the salmon was not smuggled goods. They specifically sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce requesting the Party Headquarters to return the goods. The Chamber of Commerce also believes that this matter is significant and is waiting for the authorities to handle it.</p>
<h3>Changshu County Government Bans Temple Fairs</h3>
<p>The Old City God Temple here has not held a temple fair for more than ten years. Some well-intentioned people have initiated a temple fair to be held on the 13th and 14th of this month, citing the need to revive the sluggish market. The whole county is ecstatic because the City God Fair, which has not been seen for more than ten years, is being restored. The ceremonial guard is particularly grand. Therefore, hotels and restaurants have already been fully booked, and the hotel industry has increased room rates by 20% as a donation for planes for Chiang's birthday. In addition, various merchants have also stocked up on goods to meet the demand of the fair market. The Xihu Automobile Company has also decided to open special buses from various ports starting on the 12th of this month to attract foreign visitors. Unexpectedly, the party headquarters believes that the temple fair is superstitious and has sent a letter to the county to ban it. At the moment the county government has posted a notice. However, since the fair is approaching and all preparations have been completed, it is difficult to forcibly stop it. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau will increase its forces to prevent disturbances at that time. However, merchants and residents believe that the fair market is sufficient to prosper the market and will jointly petition.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Notice Not to Discuss Stolen Coal</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce recently saw reports that stolen coal from Liujiang landed in Chengyi, causing a reaction from people in that area, and there was news that it would be transported to Changzhou for sale by barge. As it has been found that this stolen coal was previously ordered to be informed to Yongda Fumei Coal Company that it should not be undertaken to sell it, the coal number was informed to comply with this order on time. Recently, as this coal is being transported to Changzhou for sale, it should be complied with in accordance with the previous order not to undertake the sale of it. On the 9th, the Yongda Fumei Coal Company and the Coal and Iron Industry Association were specially notified to comply with this order, and a notice was published in the newspaper to the entire coal industry to uphold justice and never undertake the sale of this coal.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Loyalty Shrine Changed to Martyrs' Shrine</h3>
<p>The county government has ordered the construction of a Martyrs' Shrine. County Magistrate Yuan has decided after a meeting to rebuild the original Loyalty Shrine on Zhong Street. A construction committee has been organized, and Wu Shuying has been appointed as the director of general affairs. However, the Loyalty Shrine is full of memorial tablets of officials, soldiers, and people who died in the previous Qing Hongyang Rebellion, and the words "Royal Qing" make replacement difficult. It has been decided to set aside the center to set up a martyrs' memorial tablet to save costs.</p>
<h3>Danyang Poor Harvest of Wheat</h3>
<p>Recently, with continuous overcast and rainy weather, the wheat harvest has declined. Therefore, at the moment when they are on the market, there are not many goods to be seen in the market. Barley is priced at four yuan per dan, and wheat is priced at six yuan per dan. If the goods do not surge into the market, the price will continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Nantong The Reclamation Area Investigation Team Arrives in Tong</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Group, the Cotton Industry Control Association, and the China Yarn Factory Association have jointly formed the Northern Jiangsu Reclamation Area Investigation Team. The group of 30 people arrived in Tong at 9:00 AM on the 11th and transferred to Dongtai, Yancheng, and Funing, ending at Baojiadun. The round trip is scheduled for ten days, and they will return to Shanghai from Nantong on the 20th. Zhu Yinglan, the Chief of the Disaster Relief Committee, and Ge Tan, the Commissioner of the Southern District, are also traveling with them.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou New Wheat Enters the Market</h3>
<p>Outside the South Gate of this county is an area where old grain businesses converge. The new wheat has now entered the market. On the 8th, the price was five yuan and eight jiao per stone, which is more than two yuan cheaper than old goods.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Piracy Rampant in Ninghai</h3>
<p>The residents along the coast of Ninghai have always relied on fishing for a living. There are more than 150 fishing boats. On the 3rd of this month, near Nanjiushan, they suddenly encountered more than 50 pirates, each holding sharp weapons, who took away more than 50 fishermen and three fishing boats. There has been no news of them to date. The fishermen's families have made every effort to inquire, but there is still no information about their whereabouts. They are all in a state of panic. It is rumored that the bandits Jin Yutang and Huang Daoshou are responsible. The fishermen have already requested the county government to severely crack down on them.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou A Wonderful Tale of Rekindling Wedding Vows</h3>
<p>Mr. Cheng Zizhi, a famous scholar, traveled to Jiangsu in his early years as a Juren and served as an official with integrity. He has been highly regarded by the people of his hometown for handling charitable and public welfare affairs in his hometown after retiring from office in 1911. This year is the 80th birthday of Mr. Cheng and his wife, and the occasion of rekindling their wedding vows. However, Mr. Cheng, considering the instability of the current situation, strictly instructed his son Yangpo (currently a standing committee member of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce) not to take any action. His humility and virtue are commendable. It is now reported that several of his best friends, such as Zhang Xuan Chu and Wang Fuchuan, have initiated a small banquet at home on the 17th of this month to celebrate. It is also heard that one of the people who escorted the bride when Mr. Cheng got married is still alive and will also be invited to participate at that time. However, it is not true that Mr. Cheng's age is 82 and his wife's age is 83 as reported in the Hangzhou newspaper some days ago, and the engagement of a certain important person from the provincial government to serve as the witness of their re-wedding vows.</p>
<h3>Two Provinces Jointly Operate Fertilizer Plant</h3>

It has been decided in principle to jointly establish a mixed fertilizer manufacturing plant in Shanghai. The Zhenhai Phosphate Fertilizer Manufacturing Plant will also be jointly funded by Jiangsu Province, with an investment of 380,000 yuan from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank of China and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, each investing half. The fertilizer required by the two provinces will be put out to tender in Shanghai on the 15th of this month, the bids will be opened on the 25th, the contract will be signed at the end of the month, and the centralized management will be implemented and the plant will be established starting on July 1st.</p>
<h3>Immense Losses from Fire</h3>
<p>At 6:20 PM on the 9th, a fire suddenly broke out at Huafeng Paper Mill's northern warehouse at No. 58 Xiahe Wooden Bridge in Gongbu, due to an electrical fault. The warehouse contained a large quantity of paper stock, causing the fire to spread rapidly. The fire was uncontrollable. Firefighters from the Public Security Bureau and other fire brigades rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out after 1:00 AM on the 10th. Seven warehouses and a large amount of paper stock were destroyed, resulting in losses of over ten thousand yuan. The factory owner, Liu Guizhan, has been summoned by the Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Couple Commits Suicide Due to Silkworm Farming Losses</h3>
<p>A Mr. and Mrs. Lu, residents of Shushan Village in the eastern part of Xiaoshan County, had been silkworm farmers. This silkworm season, the initial price of leaves was low, and they had fed their silkworms over two liang of leaves. Later, the price of leaves rose to over three yuan, requiring them to spend twenty to thirty yuan on leaves daily. They borrowed from all sides to purchase leaves and feed their silkworms, hoping for a high price for the cocoons. However, the price of cocoons dropped to two yuan and fifty cents, and few people were interested in buying them. They incurred losses of over two hundred yuan. Recently, they were pressured to repay their debts and were unable to do so. Mr. Lu attempted suicide on the night of the 7th of this month. His wife, seeing her husband's death and no prospect of repaying the debts, drowned herself in a small pond behind their house on the night of the 9th, after the funeral. Neighbors discovered her, but it was too late to save her. The couple ended their lives due to the financial losses from silkworm farming, which is truly tragic.</p>

<h3>Five Organizations Jointly Telegraph for Sincere Unity to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Lest it Lead to Internal War</p>
<p>Universally Rejected by the Whole Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, Banking Association, Native Bankers' Association, and Shipping Association, after two joint meetings on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, resolved to send the following important telegram:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Government: To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Vice Premier Kong, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, Vice Chairman Feng, and Vice Chairman Yan: We recently telegraphed to the gentlemen of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee in Guangzhou, Commander-in-Chief Chen, Commander-in-Chief Li of Nanning, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai, stating: "Since the loss of the Northeast and the peril of Hebei and Chahar, we worry about the invasion of bandits and fear the imminent demise of the nation. Recently, the smuggling incidents in North China have caused immense damage to the country's finances and the national economy. Amidst the worry, fear, and indignation of the people, we suddenly read reports of the formation of an anti-Japanese and national salvation army by the leaders in the Southwest, and rumors of Guizhou troops gathering along the Hunan border. The passionate are excited, while the thoughtful are alarmed. To unite in resisting aggression is not only the only hope for the Chinese nation but also the common wish of the people.

<h3>Public Organizations Telegraph to the Southwest for Unified Steps to Save the Nation</h3>
<p>Concentrating Strength is Appropriate to Overcome National Difficulties</p>
<p>Telegraphing the Central Government to Clearly Order a Stop to Action</p>
<p>Since reports emerged that the Guangdong and Guangxi armies had entered Hunan Province, public organizations in the city have been deeply shocked. Yesterday, they urged the Central Government to promptly stop this action and also advised the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to unify their steps to save the nation, implement peaceful unity, and jointly resist aggression. A collection of telegrams is recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Second District Party Branch: The Second District Party Branch of the city, regarding the military changes in the Southwest, specially telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, stating: "Recently, reading reports from domestic and foreign newspapers, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, in the name of resisting Japan, have dispatched troops and entered neighboring provinces. Upon hearing this, the whole country is in an uproar. At a time when national crisis is imminent, all with blood in their veins should be of one heart and one mind to overcome national difficulties. Therefore, unifying goals, concentrating strength, and aligning steps are all necessary limits. If preparations are not properly made and action is taken without authorization, how is this different from giving the enemy an opportunity, turning national salvation into national harm, and plunging our nation into an abyss from which it cannot recover? Your esteemed council holistically plans the overall situation and presides over the ultimate strategy. You should promptly order the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to cease military action, gather the strength of the whole country, and prepare to quell the invaders. The haste of this telegram is paramount. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Special Municipality Second District Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party."</p>
<p>Declaration from the Municipal Farmers' Association: The Municipal Farmers' Association of the city issued a declaration stating: "Since September 18th, the national situation has deteriorated, and the people's livelihoods have declined. The entire country and nation have fallen into a state where if no measures are taken, the country will be destroyed, the race will be exterminated, and there will be no escape. Our Central Government, with careful consideration, has not only devoted itself to construction and consolidation of the national foundation but also hopes that the whole country, from top to bottom, will be sincerely united to overcome the national crisis together. How could we have known that, with alarms being frequently transmitted, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities would suddenly raise the banner of resisting Japan and advance troops into Hunan. When the news spread, the whole country was shocked. Actions against foreign enemies must be under the unified command of the Central Government, combining the strength of the entire country, in order to be effective. Now, Guangdong and Guangxi are sending troops independently, not only destroying military discipline but also forfeiting international standing and falling into Japan's trap of using Chinese to control Chinese. Only those who have lost their minds and gone mad would do this. Seeing this crisis, this association cannot remain silent. In addition to telegraphing the Central Government to promptly stop this action, we urge the people of the whole country to rise up together, loudly proclaim unity, and eliminate internal wars in order to save the country from danger. If Guangdong and Guangxi persist in their own way, using the name of resisting Japan but engaging in internal war, they are criminals of the nation, and our compatriots throughout the country should reject them. This is hereby declared. Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, respectfully submitted."</p>
<p>Joint Telegram from the First Special District: To the Political Affairs Committee of the Southwest Executive Department in Guangzhou, General Commander Chen Jitang, General Commander Li Zongren of the Guangxi Fourth Army Group, Deputy General Commander Bai Chongxi, and all commanders: In recent years, the construction of Guangdong and Guangxi has been rapidly progressing, and the political achievements are remarkable, admired by all. At this time of national crisis, the people of the country have especially high expectations for you, hoping that you will hold the south, sharing the Central Government's concerns. However, alarms have been sounded that you have changed your designation, arbitrarily moved your troops, and approached Chenzhou and scouted Hengyang. Disgruntled military personnel and politicians have gathered in Guangdong, causing anxiety throughout the country and shock around the world. Since the sudden passing of Mr. Zhan Tang, the Party and the country have lost a respected teacher. The funeral has not yet ended, but troops have been deployed on the border of Hunan and Fujian, destroying the foundation of the nation. How can we face the people of the country and comfort Mr. Hu's spirit in the afterlife? Your intention is that, at this point, only resisting the enemy can save the country. This is a sentiment shared by all, but resisting the enemy requires a united front, and saving the country requires a comprehensive strategy. If you merely act on impulse and move independently, the national army will lose unified command, expose its weaknesses, and how can we speak of resisting the enemy and saving the country? To preserve your reputation and protect the last lifeline of the country, this association cannot bear to see you destroy your history and alienate the people. Therefore, we present these frank words directly. We implore you to rein in your horses at the edge of the precipice, respect the will of the people, follow the Central Government's intentions, unify the steps to save the nation, and implement peaceful unity to appease the people's hopes. This telegram is respectfully submitted for your consideration. Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Second District Executive Committee: To the Central Executive Committee: Recently, reading reports from domestic and foreign newspapers, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, in the name of resisting Japan, have dispatched troops and entered neighboring provinces. Upon hearing this, the whole country is in an uproar. At a time when national crisis is imminent, all with blood in their veins should be of one heart and one mind to overcome national difficulties. Therefore, unifying goals, concentrating strength, and aligning steps are all necessary limits. If preparations are not properly made and action is taken without authorization, how is this different from giving the enemy an opportunity, turning national salvation into national harm, and plunging our nation into an abyss from which it cannot recover? Your esteemed council holistically plans the overall situation and presides over the ultimate strategy. You should promptly order the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities to cease military action, gather the strength of the whole country, and prepare to quell the invaders. The haste of this telegram is paramount. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Special Municipality Second District Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>Joint Telegram from the Second Special District: Telegram 1: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission: We have recently received reports that the Guangdong and Guangxi armies, in the name of resisting Japan, have invaded Hunan Province. Such measures are perverse and insane. We request that your government issue a clear order to stop this action, to maintain military discipline and stabilize the foundation of the nation. This is our hope. Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation, respectfully submitted." Telegram 2: "To Mr. Chen Jitang of Guangzhou and Mr. Li Zongren, and the Generals of Guangxi: We have recently received reports that the military and civilians of Guangdong and Guangxi, in their sorrow for the deepening national crisis, are advocating resistance against Japan, which is deeply moving. To save the nation from danger, there is no other way but to resist the enemy. However, foreign reports state that the units under your command have invaded Hunan Province without receiving orders from the Central Government, and that all military funds and supplies are said to come from the enemy, with enemies even participating in military affairs. This means that you are resisting Japan to save the country in name, but engaging in internal warfare in reality. This association is deeply alarmed. Since September 18th, the nation's fortunes have declined, and the national strength has waned. We rely on the entire country, from top to bottom, to be of one heart and one mind, to unite in resisting foreign aggression and saving the nation, and to jointly plan for the survival of the nation. How can we allow the arbitrary start of chaos and internecine strife, depleting the nation's vitality and increasing the people's suffering? Your actions are not only destroying your own character and alienating the people of the country but also pleasing our enemies and saddening our friends. In short, resisting the enemy and saving the country is the shared desire of all, but it requires collective planning and effort, under the leadership of a strong central government, with thorough preparation and a comprehensive resolution. Independent actions will not help us overcome the difficulties of the time. If you have concrete plans to resist the enemy, you can submit them to the Central Government. If you use the nation as a tool for personal gain due to private views, all Chinese people will oppose it. Moreover, in recent days, the Guangdong currency has plummeted, the financial situation is chaotic, and industry and commerce have come to a standstill. The merchants of Shanghai are already deeply suffering. Therefore, we send this telegram, hoping that you will rein in your horses at the edge of the precipice and immediately demobilize all troops, in order to maintain the foundation of the nation and secure the people's livelihoods. This is our prayer. Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation, respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>Telegraph Communications Around Hengzhou: Normal Transmission and Reception</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, it was reported in the evening newspapers of this city yesterday that telegraph communications in over thirty locations around Hengyang were once cut off yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday) and that telegraph service had not been restored as of this morning (i.e., yesterday morning). The Central News Agency reporter stated last night, according to Shanghai Telegraph Bureau Director Bao Keyong, that this information is completely inaccurate. Telegraph communications around Hengyang have not been cut off recently. Transmission and reception between Changsha and Guangzhou are proceeding as usual.</p>
<h3>City Education Authorities State: Order in All Schools is Normal</h3>
<p>If Unruly Elements Are Discovered</p>
<p>They Will Of Course Be Firmly Dealt With</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter visited the city's education authorities yesterday to inquire about the situation in various schools. According to the response, since Premier Jiang's speech to the principals and student representatives of various universities last winter, all schools have been able to deeply understand the policies of the Central Government. Therefore, all schools have intensified the implementation of emergency education during this time of national crisis, and students are quite capable of conducting extracurricular research. After the spring break, students in all schools have returned to class as usual. Graduation classes are now conducting examinations. The joint graduation examination for middle school students has already been scheduled. Senior high schools are holding branch examinations, while junior high schools have switched to random examinations. Students in all schools are currently immersed in preparations. Although, recently, due to the current situation, some bored politicians have attempted to instigate student unrest, and a small number of students, under false pretenses, have secretly planned incitement and have encouraged others to avoid examinations, students in all schools have been able to understand the greater good, and teachers have provided appropriate guidance. Therefore, order in all schools is normal and has not been affected in the slightest, which is gratifying. However, it was recently discovered that some students in a certain grade of the attached middle school of the Sino-French Engineering College are suspected of being communists. The school authorities, fearing that this would affect other students, have advanced the start of the holiday. In the future, if unruly elements are discovered in any school, the authorities will surely deal with them firmly to avoid harming good students. At this time of national crisis and serious foreign aggression, we sincerely hope that young people will recognize the necessity of unity from top to bottom and, under the leadership of the Central Government, make the necessary preparations for themselves and not engage in useless actions that please the enemy.</p>

<h3>The Nanhua Shipping Line Reduces Its Number of Voyages and Suspends Sailings</h3>
<p>Financial Impacts: Guangzhou Merchants Stop Loading Cargo</p>
<p>Shipping Declines: Crew Members Dismissed and Unemployed</p>
<p>In the past three days, due to the current situation, the price of the Guangdong currency has fallen to an unprecedented record. Sixteen or seventeen yuan of Guangdong currency are equivalent to ten Hong Kong dollars, a decrease of two-fifths compared to the normal price. The Guangzhou merchants in Shanghai, after receiving telegrams from Guangzhou, have stopped loading various purchased goods. Only essential items are being shipped. The difference between the Guangdong currency and the Shanghai currency is too great, and it will be difficult to sell the goods in Guangzhou. Yesterday, the Haizhen ship sailed with a rare lack of cargo. The Haiyuan ship was diverted to Qingdao. The cargo for the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nanhua ships has also decreased sharply.</p>
<p>Taikoo Reduces Voyages: The British-owned Taikoo Company, located on Nanhua Road, has the largest presence. It originally had regular ships sailing to Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and Haiphong, with five voyages per week on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Temporary ships were not included. More than 45 regular Nanhua voyages were made each month. Recently, due to the decline in cargo and the decrease in business, the company has reduced the number of regular Nanhua voyages from Shanghai to two per week, changing the voyages to Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, reducing the number of voyages by about eight or nine per month.</p>
<p>Suspension of Voyages for Various Ships: The Taikoo Company had more than ten temporary ships sailing between Nanhua and Shanghai and also sailing to North China. Recently, due to a lack of cargo, the company decided to suspend the voyages of seven ships first. The Liangzhou and Yingzhou ships have already stopped sailing, and crew members have been dismissed. Now, due to a greater lack of cargo, the company has officially decided to suspend the voyages of various ships. The Zhejiang will officially stop sailing upon arrival in Shanghai today. The Luzhou and Chongqing are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th for a break. The Chengdu will also come to Shanghai and stop sailing. Only the Ganzhou is still transporting coal in Haizhou and will also have to stop sailing soon.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province: Cancellation of the Hemp Surtax Approved by the Southwest Political Affairs Committee</h3>

The committee will investigate all factories and merchants and confiscate any smuggled goods. These smuggled goods will then be auctioned off at a reduced price, and the proceeds will be used for national defense construction. The Federation will submit these proposals to an executive committee meeting to be held this week for discussion. Additionally, the Federation of Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories, responding to member demands to oppose the increase of troops in North China and smuggling, has decided to raise the issue at its upcoming general meeting to discuss concrete measures.</p>

<h3>Hu Zongduo Has Not Yet Left Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Zongduo, since returning to Shanghai from the sacrifice to Hu Bei with the eight central members, has been suffering from a slight cold and has been recuperating at his residence in Shanghai. Rumors that he has gone elsewhere are entirely false.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Claims Purpose of Guizhou Army's Actions, Guangdong's Attitude Undecided</h3>
<p>*Shen Shi News* local report: According to news from New York, Shanghai news was widely reported in newspapers here on the 7th, stating that, according to reliable sources, the Guangxi military leaders are about to start actions against the central government, with Hengzhou, Hunan as the first target. The pretext used is resistance to Japan, but the real reason seems to be that Guangxi military leaders Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi are venting their resentment towards Chiang Kai-shek, and foreign powers are secretly helping them and supplying them with military supplies. Nanjing is determined to stop them after they launch their actions. Guangdong's attitude is undecided. Based on this, the intelligence released by Japan a few days ago, saying that the Southwest has already begun hostile actions against the central government, is premature.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Restricts Import of Native Cloth</h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the Dutch East Indies' restriction on the import of Chinese native cloth. The letter stated that the Shanghai Native Cloth Trade Association had previously written to the Bureau, requesting that it forward letters to the Consulate in the Netherlands and the Commercial Commissioner to negotiate for the cancellation of the restriction on the import of native cloth. The Bureau had already forwarded letters to the Consulate in Batavia and the Commercial Commissioner in Semarang, requesting them to find ways to handle the matter, and had also submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct them to handle the matter. The Bureau had also replied to the Association. The Consulate General in Batavia replied with letter number 2688, stating that the Consulate had received letter number 627 from the Bureau, as well as a letter and several fabric samples from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Medan. The Consulate had submitted the case to the Director of the Import Bureau of the Department, requesting him to instruct all customs offices to allow the entry of overweight Chinese coarse cloth as usual, and had attached the fabric samples sent by the Medan Chamber of Commerce for inspection. The Director replied, stating that he had repeatedly allowed the import of special Chinese cotton cloth that exceeded the specified weight, and would consider the interests of the importers of these special Chinese cotton cloth as much as possible. However, he could not comply with the Consul General's request for a general allowance. Whether or not the import of cotton cloth exceeding the specified weight could be approved must be submitted for approval on a case-by-case basis. Importers who intend to import cotton cloth exceeding the specified weight must submit samples for inspection no later than when submitting the application requesting the issuance of the relevant permit. If the import permit for cotton cloth does not contain clauses regarding the specified quantity, the merchant only needs to send the permit to the customs for inspection when the goods are imported, and the goods can be released without hindrance. The Bureau has informed the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Medan and is now forwarding copies of the correspondence between the Consulate and the Director to the Bureau for reference, hoping that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Native Cloth Trade Association will be informed for their reference.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Notifies Stock Exchange Federation to Strictly Prohibit Brokers from Trading Off-Exchange, Orders Compliance with Law for All Transaction Records, Penalties for Brokers Who Disobey, Report to Ministry of Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, due to the inability of various stock exchanges in Shanghai to enforce the requirement for brokers to create transaction records in accordance with the law, which has led to a small number of profit-seeking brokers privately settling accounts off-exchange, undermining national taxes and disrupting the market, affecting social stability, notified the Stock Exchange Federation again to reiterate the previous order, strictly prohibiting such practices, and instructed them to inform all stock exchanges and brokers associations. The original text of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's notification is excerpted as follows: "Stock exchanges have the special privilege of managing the market. All transactions made by brokers or members in the market, from the time of transaction to the completion of settlement, are subject to the condition that they are effective through the stock exchange. The former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in the 18th year of the Republic (1929), received a report from the Federation stating that brokers were trading off-exchange and privately settling accounts, which was a clear violation of the law. The Ministry responded with Business Document No. 2444, stating that clients entrusting trades should request the stock exchange to stamp and certify all transactions made at any time, and that the stock exchanges themselves should strictly abide by the regulations and earnestly eliminate long-standing malpractices. After the implementation of the Stock Exchange Law, it was clearly stipulated in Article 29 of the implementing rules that the notification letter of brokers' buying, selling, and settling on the stock exchange would not be effective unless it was stamped and certified by the stock exchange. Last year, the amended Stock Exchange Law was promulgated, and Article 38, Paragraph 2, further stipulated that the transaction record should be created by the stock exchange and issued to both brokers for signature and completion. All these regulations are intended to ensure that all trades made by brokers are carried out through the stock exchange to obtain legal protection and avoid the malpractices of private transactions. It has now been found that the Shanghai stock exchanges often act perfunctorily towards the trades of each broker and do not enforce the requirement to create transaction records in accordance with the law. As a result, brokers seeking private gain can privately settle accounts outside the stock exchange and take advantage of short-selling, which not only erodes national taxes, stock exchange revenue, and transaction fees, but also affects the financial market and social stability. Such trading practices that do not comply with legal procedures should be strictly prohibited to maintain the law. In the future, all trades made by brokers on behalf of clients, whether buying, selling, or settling, must be carried out through the stock exchange to which they belong, and the transaction record must be created by the stock exchange in accordance with the law and issued to both brokers for signature and completion. If any broker violates this regulation or engages in private settlement and trading off-exchange, the stock exchange to which they belong shall impose penalties in accordance with the regulations and report the matter to the Ministry for verification. Stock exchanges should also manage the market and handle trading and settlement matters in accordance with laws and regulations, without any errors. In addition to instructing the Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervisor to supervise compliance at any time, this notification is hereby issued to the Federation, instructing it to inform all stock exchanges and brokers associations to comply and truthfully report the compliance to the Ministry for record. This is hereby notified. June 6, 25th year of the Republic of China (1936). Minister Wu Dingchang."</p>

<h3>Fourth Son of Cen Chunxuan Accused of Cohabiting with a Dancer, Both Parties Have Reached an Out-of-Court Settlement, Court Rules Inadmissible</h3>
<p>Cen Delin (also known as Shenxian), the fourth son of Cen Chunxuan, the former Governor-General of Liangguang and Chief Executive of the Southwest Military Government during the late Qing Dynasty, who married Ding Naixian, the sister of Ding Naiyang, the former Salt Commissioner of Lianghuai, cohabited with Zhang Ying (also known as Zhang Yin), a dancer at the Fuxing Shanghai Ballroom, in room 10 of the apartment building at No. 446 Seymour Road. After Ding discovered this, she reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate and found that Cen and Zhang were indeed cohabiting. She then filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court on the charge of adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. After hearing the case, the court ordered a postponement for further hearing. Within the postponement period, Cen and Zhang each paid bail to ensure their appearance as required, with a guarantee responsibility of no less than 10,000 yuan, ordering the two parties to reach a settlement out of court. Yesterday morning was the date for the continuation of the hearing.

<h3>On the Relocation of Graves in Ning County, a Lawsuit Regarding the Abandonment of Corpses Has Been Filed: Gan Shi-xiong Sues His Brother and Nephew</h3>
<p>After the death of Gan Chang-chun, the Ningbo native and owner of the Gan Fu Tai Woolen Shop on Broadway Road, he left behind a significant amount of property. It was immediately divided according to the law among his son, Gan Shi-tao, Gan Shi-xiong, and grandson, Yu Xue-ting, and others. A portion of the property was designated as ancestral property, with its income used for ancestral sacrifices. The three individuals would take turns managing it each year. The annual income from this ancestral property was approximately one thousand several hundred yuan. This year, it was Gan Shi-xiong's turn to manage it. Furthermore, due to the Ning County government's order that all graves in the urban area must be relocated, Gan Shi-xiong consulted with Gan Shi-tao and Gan Xue-ting about how to proceed and requested the ancestral property deeds be handed over. However, the two refused to hand them over and, on April 28th, Gan Shi-tao's wife, Zhang, evicted Gan Shi-xiong from her residence at No. 6 Houde Lane, Gansu Road. Consequently, Gan Shi-xiong filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Gan Shi-tao, Gan Xue-ting, and Gan Zhang for abandoning corpses and obstructing the exercise of his rights. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shu-zi presided over the Third Criminal Court and summoned them for questioning. According to Gan Shi-xiong's testimony, on April 1st, due to the county government's order to relocate graves, he specifically consulted with the defendants. However, they all refused to take any action and refused to hand over the ancestral property deeds. On April 28th, when he went to Gan Shi-tao's house, his wife, Zhang, ordered two individuals who resembled gangsters to evict him, which is why he filed the lawsuit. Gan Shi-tao and Gan Xue-ting testified that this year was indeed the plaintiff's turn to manage the ancestral property, but he was deeply addicted to opium. The houses in Shanghai had been almost entirely sold off. If the ancestral property were handed over to him, it would inevitably be sold off. Therefore, it was specifically kept in the custody of the Shanghai Industrial Bank. As for the income from the ancestral property, he was free to collect it. Regarding the grave relocation matter, Gan Xue-ting had been to Ningbo several times, and the county government had now announced that old graves did not need to be relocated. Therefore, there was no need for further relocation. When questioned, Gan Zhang also denied instigating gangsters to evict the plaintiff. The court, having clarified the facts, ordered the start of the debate and then declared the conclusion of the hearing, setting a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Compulsory Demolition of Rooms on Sun Decks in the Nine Acres Area; Police Hire Masons and Carpenters on Behalf of the Landlord; Tenants Suffer Significant Losses</h3>
<p>The houses along the Nine Acres Area's Luxiangyuan Road were newly built last year by the Anhe Company. They are divided into five neighborhoods: Ren'an Lane, Yi'an Lane, Ji'an Lane, Zhi'an Lane, and Xin'an Lane, totaling over two hundred buildings. After the construction was completed, tenants successively opened businesses or residences. Recently, due to the sluggish market and planned economy, to reduce expenses, small rooms were added on the sun decks, or a small floor was added. Each household spent approximately two hundred yuan in legal tender. Recently, the Municipal Public Works Bureau discovered that adding rooms to completed buildings could be dangerous. They notified the Anhe Company to inform the tenants to demolish the additions by a deadline. However, all the tenants, feeling that the construction had been very costly, intended to petition the authorities for a postponement of the demolition. Unfortunately, the deadline had passed. Yesterday (Tuesday), the competent branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched numerous police officers, along with the landlord, to supervise a large number of masons and carpenters, etc., to forcibly demolish the additions in each neighborhood. Within half a day, the rooms built on the sun decks of hundreds of houses were completely demolished, and the tenants suffered significant losses.</p>

<h3>There are 730,000 Monks and Nuns Nationwide; The Number of Lay Buddhists Reaches Over 3 Million; Five Provinces Including Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Henan are Not Included</h3>
<p>The number of temples, monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists (commonly known as those who practice with hair) in our country has never been statistically recorded. Even Buddhists themselves cannot give a definite answer. Last spring, the Chinese Buddhist Association sent letters to local branches to collect statistical materials on this matter. After compiling and submitting the tables, the association has now compiled the results. The figures are approximately as follows: There are over 267,000 large and small temples and nunneries nationwide (excluding the five provinces of Sichuan, Henan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan). The number of monks and nuns totals over 738,000. The number of lay Buddhists (i.e., devotees) is over 3,690,000, which is more than five times the number of monks and nuns.</p>
<h3>The "Min Tuo" Ship Suffers Damage After Its Victory</h3>
<p>The "Min Tuo" Suffers More Damage After the "Victory"</p>
<p>The "Min Tuo" of the Minsheng Company is a shallow-water riverboat that operates on the routes from Yichang to Chongqing and Shanghai to Chongqing. Recently, the bottom of the ship suffered minor damage and needed to undergo major repairs in dry dock. This time, the ship came from Chongqing to Shanghai to unload cargo and entered the Laogongmao Shipyard on the 9th for repairs. Unexpectedly, after the dry dock was filled with water and the gate was closed, the gate suddenly broke due to the force of the water. The water rushed downstream, causing the hull of the "Min Tuo" to be pushed and swing from side to side, resulting in it colliding with the stone wall inside the dry dock. The iron plates on the outer hull of the ship were all damaged, and it is said that the hull was also breached, causing flooding. After the accident, the Minsheng Company was immediately notified. Yesterday, the Maritime Affairs Bureau dispatched technicians to inspect the damage. Today, the water in the dry dock still needs to be drained to further inspect the bottom of the ship before estimating the damage and carrying out repairs.</p>
<p>The "Victory" Runs Aground on a Sandbar</p>
<p>The "Victory" of the Zhengji Company is a ship with a deadweight of 924 tons, a length of 215 feet, a width of 31 feet 3 inches, and a draft of 14 feet 6 inches. It can travel 9 nautical miles per hour. It originally sailed the Shanghai-Beiyang route. Recently, it loaded cargo in Dalian and headed to Japan. While sailing outside the entrance of Wakayama Port, it ran aground on a sandbar because the nautical chart did not have any record of a sandbar there. The captain of the "Victory" did not know about the sandbar and unfortunately ran aground. After the accident, the captain immediately telegraphed the Wakayama office, requesting that a tugboat be sent to rescue the ship as soon as possible, planning to tow it off the sandbar at high tide. The Shanghai company has also been notified.</p>

<p>Multiple Tenants: 370 Rue Foch is a single-bay lower-level house rented by Guo Benren from Ningbo. In addition to using the street level as a shop, the front building on the second floor was sublet to Feng Renlu (a traveling salesman) and his wife from Wuxi. The rear building was also sublet to Xi A'da (an automotive repairman) and his wife from Pudong. Xi's wife had given birth to a girl earlier this month. At the same time, a three-story loft was built upstairs and rented by Lu Qiaosheng, who worked as a tea server at the Southeast Hotel.</p>
<p>Five Fatalities: At 2:30 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the Hexingchang shop on the lower level. Because it was late at night, all the residents were fast asleep. By the time they realized what was happening, the fire had already spread rapidly. The stairs connecting the lower level to the second floor had been burned away, preventing Feng and his wife in the front building, Xi A'da's wife and newborn child in the rear building, and the shop owner Guo Benren's father-in-law (surnamed Li) from escaping. They were all burned to death in a terrible tragedy.</p>
<p>Fire Did Not Spread to Neighbors: Those who were burned on the head and face or injured after jumping from the building included Xi A'da, Lu Qiaosheng, Xi Lin'gen, Li Zhixiang, Hang Xiaolin, and Li Guo. The Xinzha Fire Brigade quickly arrived with five pump trucks and one ambulance, and the Tiantong Road Fire Brigade also arrived with one pump truck to help put out the fire. At the same time, the injured were transported to Binlong Hospital for treatment. By about 4:00 AM, the fire was extinguished, preventing it from spreading to neighboring buildings. The Chengdu Road Police Station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to maintain order at the scene.</p>
<p>Court Inspection: During the removal of the five bodies (two men, two women, and one child), it was discovered that Xi A'da's wife was not yet dead, so she was taken to Guangren Hospital. However, she died soon after due to her severe injuries. The bodies were transported to the Forensic Examination Office on Fellen Road. At approximately 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Song Gen-shan, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zu-ji, to inspect the bodies one by one to confirm their identities. Afterward, the detectives reported the situation and stated that the preliminary investigation suggested that the fire was caused by an electrical fault. Mr. Song then ruled that the deaths were caused by burns sustained in the fire. The bodies of Xi Zhang, Xi's daughter were released to Xi Zhiben, and the body of Li Litang was released to Guo Benshun. As the Feng family's relatives have not yet been identified, their bodies were delivered to the Pushan Cemetery pending claims.</p>
<h3>The Wife of Painter Cheng Yao-sheng Accuses His Adopted Son of Embezzlement and Abandonment; The Case Involves Cheng Yao-sheng's Scandalous History; Due to Incorrect Citation of Laws, the Hearing is Postponed</h3>
<p>Cheng Li Xiujin (age 50), the wife of the late famous painter Cheng Yao-sheng from Anhui, residing at No. 190 Temple Street in Xiaodongmen, Nanshi, Shanghai, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division against Cheng Yao-sheng's adopted son, Cheng Yin-sheng (age 35, residing in Taiping Bridge), and Rong-sheng (age 30, residing at No. 40 Tianzhutang Street, Yongqing Money Exchange), the son he had with a Wuxi maid, accusing them of embezzlement and abandonment. The plaintiff stated that when she was 17 years old, Yang Gui-sheng (a colleague of Yao-sheng), an employee of the Jihang Pawnshop in Changzhou, acted as matchmaker. In November of the same year, she married Cheng Yao-sheng at his residence at Muqiaotou in Changzhou. The following year, she gave birth to a son named Rongguan, who died shortly after birth. During this time, Yao-sheng's artistic talent became renowned, and he resigned from his pawnshop job to come to Shanghai with her, where he earned a considerable income from painting. Yao-sheng then indulged in pleasure, leading to a breakdown in the couple's relationship. He often beat the plaintiff. When the plaintiff was 33 years old, she became pregnant and was beaten, resulting in a miscarriage. While she was hospitalized, Yao-sheng had an affair with Dai, a maid he had hired from Wuxi. From then on, the maid usurped the plaintiff's position and colluded to abuse the plaintiff. They brought in the son the Wuxi maid, Dai, had given birth to, renamed him Rong-sheng, and raised him together. Unable to endure the abuse, the plaintiff went to Guangfu Temple in Changzhou, where she recited scriptures day and night, resigned to her fate. By 1934, the plaintiff's private savings had been exhausted, and her supplies were cut off, leading to a lawsuit. After mediation by friends and relatives, Yao-sheng paid her 1,500 yuan as temporary living expenses. Unexpectedly, Yao-sheng passed away on March 15th of this year. The first defendant, Yin-sheng, and the second defendant, Rong-sheng, colluded to not notify the plaintiff and embezzled all of Yao-sheng's assets worth over ten thousand yuan and abandoned the plaintiff. She requested that the court investigate and prosecute them according to the law and also filed a civil lawsuit to recover living expenses. Based on the lawsuit, the court summoned the parties to the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning, with Judge Sun Peng-xian presiding. First, the plaintiff, Cheng Li Xiujin, recounted the events. The first defendant, Cheng Yin-sheng, testified that he did not know the plaintiff. The second defendant was represented by a lawyer, who submitted a defense and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The lawyer stated that Yao-sheng had passed away and that the will named the defendant as the legal heir. There was also an elderly mother, Cheng Dai, and the plaintiff was not mentioned. Furthermore, the lawyer stated that the deceased father's documents included a receipt signed by the plaintiff on December 22, 1934, stating that due to her poverty, she had received 1,500 yuan in national currency from her late husband out of compassion, and that she would never make any further requests. There was also no record of a marriage in Changzhou. After reviewing the lawsuits from both sides, the court determined that the plaintiff had cited the wrong criminal law articles in her lawsuit. Therefore, the hearing was postponed, and the plaintiff was instructed to correct the lawsuit before a new hearing date would be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Zhu Wenbao Borrows Ancient Silver to Deceive a Foolish Woman; He Knocks Off a Corner of the Silver and Melts It to Cash In; Relatives Discover It is Fake</h3>
<p>Lu Zhao, a woman residing at No. 569 Kang Nao Tuo Road, West Shanghai, filed a lawsuit with the District Court accusing Zhu Wenbao of fraud, stating that the defendant brought her three silver ingots in March of the previous year, each weighing one hundred taels. He falsely claimed that a villager had unearthed hundreds of ancient silver ingots, but he was afraid of being reported and could not exchange them all at once. Each ingot was worth about one hundred and several tens of yuan, and if she could buy them, she would make a great profit. At first, she was hesitant and undecided. The defendant then knocked off a corner of the silver ingot on the spot, melted it, and asked her to take it to a silver shop to exchange it. It was said that she exchanged it for one yuan and forty cents, proving that it was genuine silver. The plaintiff believed it was true and handed over 150 yuan as the price of the three ingots for the time being. Cao Dai was present at the scene and witnessed the transaction. The defendant also said that the purchase of the silver ingots should not be disclosed to outsiders, otherwise, they might be confiscated by the authorities. After a short period of time, he would find a way to exchange them for cash. The plaintiff then hid the silver ingots in a secret place. Recently, she heard that possessing silver was against the law, so she negotiated with the defendant to exchange them for cash, but he kept postponing it. When her relatives found out about it, they examined the silver and discovered that it was fake. When she confronted the defendant, he threatened her. She originally intended to hand him over to the Public Security Bureau, but he had a lot of influence in the Caojiadu area and had many followers. She feared that she would fail and suffer harm instead. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit for investigation and prosecution. Judge Tang summoned the defendant for questioning yesterday. Zhu stated that he was also deceived. The judge ordered him to be released and to investigate and verify the facts.</p>
<h3>Swapping an Artificial Gold Bangle; Shop Owner Refuses and Gathers a Crowd to Assault; Further Incites a Dog to Bite the Customer; Ms. Wan Zhang Suffers Injuries to Her Waist, Arms, Legs, etc.; The Shop Owner and His Wife Have Fled Without a Trace</h3>
<p>Li Bolie from Anhui previously opened the Libolie Artificial Gold Jewelry Foreign Firm at No. 7 Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road, and placed advertisements in the newspaper promising eight months of guaranteed use, return, and exchange. On the 25th of last month, Ms. Wan Zhang (named Zhang Guiying), a woman from Yangzhou residing at No. 5 Bailianjing, Pudong, went to the shop and purchased an artificial gold bangle for one national currency yuan. The shop issued a warranty. After Ms. Wan purchased the bangle and wore it for less than two weeks, the bangle changed color. Therefore, at about 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, she took the bangle to exchange it. Unexpectedly, Li Bolie, the shop owner, not only refused to exchange it but also used foul language and gathered his wife, Li Wu, Qi Hong Wu, Hong Guifang (Hong Wu's daughter), and others to violently assault Ms. Wan Zhang, causing injuries. Not satisfied, they released a dog, which bit Ms. Wan Zhang's leg. She reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station, and detective Sun Da-fa was instructed to investigate. Ms. Wan Zhang was sent to Guangren Hospital for examination, which confirmed that she had injuries to her waist, arms, legs, and other parts of her body. The dog bite on her leg required treatment from the Public Works Bureau's Health Department. Detective Sun immediately went to the Libolie shop to arrest the perpetrators. However, Li Bolie and his wife were nowhere to be found. Only Hong Wu and Hong Guifang were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court's Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. The Police Station's lawyer, Qian Xun-jiu, stated the facts and filed a lawsuit under Article 277 of the Criminal Law, stating that Li Bolie's dog was not licensed and that it was necessary to further diagnose whether Ms. Wan Zhang's dog bite injuries were life-threatening. Therefore, he requested that the hearing be postponed. Ms. Wan Zhang then testified, providing details of how Hong Wu and her daughter had assaulted her. Both defendants denied the assault, claiming they only tried to dissuade them. Judge Lin verified the testimonies and ordered the case to be postponed for one week for further hearing. The two defendants were each released on 200 yuan bail.</p>

They agreed on a fee of seven yuan. Wang Zhang then gave Lu Wu musk and medicine to induce miscarriage and instructed her to take it. Unexpectedly, after many days, the fetus did not come out, and the pain gradually increased, becoming very dangerous. She had no choice but to be sent to Guangren Hospital the day before yesterday. After examination, the doctor confirmed that she was injured by taking abortion medication and performed surgery to remove the fetus. The Xinzha Police Station was notified, and detectives Huang Si-ming and Kai Nai-tai were sent to investigate. Wang Zhang was arrested and sent to the Women's Detention Center.

<h3>Achievements of the Disputes Mediation Office of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society: Resolving Difficulties, Pacifying Matters, Weighing Emotions and Reasons, Maintaining a Fair Attitude</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society has over 40,000 registered rickshaw pullers as members. With such a large number of members, most of whom are laborers with limited knowledge, disputes often arise in their daily interactions. Moreover, their occupational environment involves constant contact with the outside world, whether they are running through the streets and unexpectedly encountering accidents, or embroiled in wage disputes that escalate into violent brawls. Before the establishment of the Mutual Aid Society, rickshaw pullers facing such incidents were often forced by their status and economic circumstances to endure unfair resolutions, even when they were in the right. At this time, the Mutual Aid Society's banner of protecting rickshaw pullers became the only reliable place for these rickshaw pullers to seek justice. Therefore, weighing emotions and reasons, resolving difficulties, and pacifying disputes became a considerable challenge for the responsible personnel of the association. Currently, the responsibility for handling such matters rests with the Disputes Mediation Office of the association. Since its establishment, the office has accepted and satisfactorily resolved approximately over two thousand cases, with compensation amounts ranging from a minimum of half a yuan to a maximum of 360 yuan. These cases include disputes between rickshaw pullers, disputes between rickshaw pullers and contractors, disputes between rickshaw pullers and police officers, and collisions between automobiles and rickshaws. After accepting such cases, the Mediation Office truly strives to handle them with utmost effort. Its attitude is always fair, its procedures are simple and swift, and its consideration of circumstances and application of reason are accurate and cautious. What is particularly commendable is that although the association's main purpose is to protect rickshaw pullers, it never favors them. It maintains complete impartiality in determining who is right and who is wrong. As a result, even though it never forces anyone to comply, most parties leave satisfied. Even when disputes arise between rickshaw pullers and rickshaw owners or contractors, those who accept mediation harbor no resentment. Furthermore, the ultimate goal of the office in handling these cases is to pacify the situation. Unless the circumstances are serious and there is no other option, it never easily resorts to legal procedures. The fact that all over two thousand dispute cases have been resolved satisfactorily in the Disputes Mediation Office, with only one or two out of every hundred cases being transferred to legal counsel, speaks volumes.</p>

According to the plaintiff Wang Tiangao, he had known Zhang Genbao (i.e., Li Jinsheng) for more than ten years, and he had repeatedly refused to lend him money. He said that businessmen have legitimate businesses and dare not associate with thieves. When questioned, Li and Tang confessed that Wang had planned and discussed the robbery case at Jiangjiaqiao on March 7th in the Liang'an Apartment, and that he had also said that if there was any trouble, he could find a way to help. After the court president Wang Gangxu verified the confession, he decided that the case still needed to be investigated and rescheduled the hearing for the morning of the 24th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Husband Catches Wife in Adultery: Wang Youbin Designs to Expose the Affair; Wu Jinyu is Sent to the Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Wang Youbin, 25 years old, a native of Baoying, opened a sheet metal shop in Shihuiyao, West Shanghai. He married a woman named Yuan, 20 years old, who was quite beautiful. Recently, she was seduced by a neighbor named Wu Jinyu, who secretly visited her more than once. Yesterday, Yuan again pretended to go out shopping, but in fact, she had been secretly invited by Wu Jinyu to a rendezvous in a room at the Tianzhen Hotel on Jessfield Road. Wang Youbin learned about this and immediately went to the hotel, found the adulterous couple, and reported it to the police on duty there. The police took them to the police station and transferred them to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau. The bureau considered the case to be related to adultery and immediately ordered them to be sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suspect Xu Hexiang Gave the Gun in the Zhoujiazui Road Robbery Case</h3>
<p>On the 28th of last month, at 8:00 PM, four bandits suddenly came to the home of Zhang Ziren, a native of Suzhou, at No. 69, Lane 850, Zhoujiazui Road, and threatened them with guns, prohibiting them from making any noise. They robbed the family of valuables worth 100 yuan and fled in different directions. Cai Liu, the Chinese detective chief of the Huishan Police, and detectives Sun Shaqiong and Dong Fugen rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and arrested two thieves, Fang Amao from Pudong and Qian Baobao from Shanghai. Fang was shot in the back while resisting and was taken to the police hospital along with a five-inch Browning pistol loaded with live ammunition. Qian confessed that the gun was owned by Xu Hexiang, a native of Shanghai who worked as a machine engineer at the 31st Printing Factory at No. 797, Kunming Road. The detectives then went to his home at No. 112, Huasheng Road, and arrested Xu, who was taken to the First Special District Court. Xu completely denied providing the gun and claimed that he did not know Fang Amao. It was ordered that Xu be detained until Fang recovered from his injuries for further investigation. Yesterday morning, the police sent Fang and Qian, along with the suspect Xu Hexiang, to the Third Criminal Court. According to Fang Amao's confession, he went to commit the robbery with Xu Afa, Zhang Agen, and Qian Baobao, who were still at large. Zhang Agen came up with the idea, and Zhang and Xu took the stolen goods. The gun was borrowed from Xu by Zhang at that time. The court questioned Fang, "You previously admitted at the police station that the gun was picked up by the volunteer army during the January 28th Incident. Why is your confession contradictory?" Fang said that his previous statement was false. When questioned, Qian insisted that Xu had indeed given him the gun. (It was found that Qian had also committed a robbery case before and had been sentenced to 15 years, but was released in a general amnesty.) Xu Hexiang confessed that they were completely framing him because their business introduction had failed. Although he had a four-inch small pistol for self-defense, licensed by the Public Works Department, he had returned it two years ago. Acting lawyer Wu Linkun stated that when the victim's family was robbed, he was working in the factory and had been invited to dinner by the Erh Lai Company at the Tongxinglou Restaurant. His colleague Zhu, a foreman, could testify. According to Zhu Deyuan, Xu Hexiang was indeed at the factory at that time and did not leave. He did have a gun before, which was licensed by the police department for self-defense. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered that the police investigate the case further and check Xu Hexiang's previously licensed self-defense gun's size and number, and the date his license was revoked before further investigation. All the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Pushan Mountain Villa Performs Opera to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pushan Mountain Villa has been handling good deeds such as burying exposed corpses and providing coffins and medicine for over 20 years. It is practical and has achieved remarkable results. However, it has always lacked funds, making fundraising difficult. With the arrival of the hot summer, the hospitals' collection of corpses and the number of people seeking medical treatment have become increasingly busy. Labor and materials are expensive, and expenses are huge. The financial situation is becoming more and more strained. Therefore, the directors of the villa, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, and Yuan Ludeng, have launched a campaign to perform Peking Opera day and night at the Tianchan Stage on the 15th of this month to raise funds. Participants are all famous celebrities, ladies, and amateur performers from Shanghai.

They are all masterpieces. Zhao Ruquan, an artist, is also enthusiastically participating in the Peng Gong An.

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I have read the report in your newspaper on August 9th, third page, ninth sheet, about the Jingfeng Printing and Dyeing Company accusing Huang Shengchang of embezzlement. It stated that Huang Shengchang is the factory director of Weilun Woolen Mill, etc. It has been verified that Mr. Huang resigned from his position this year and has taken up another job. The interview in your newspaper is inconsistent with the facts. Please correct the historical record. Sincerely, Weilun Woolen Mill, June 10th.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I have read the report in your newspaper on May 7th stating that the families of the deceased Mei Shijun and Ma Atao each received a condolence payment of 1,000 yuan from the Japanese side. I once questioned your newspaper about this and was told that it was obtained through investigation. I don't know what the psychology of such reporters is. Since Mei Shijun's death, I have never had any contact with any Japanese. Who received the 1,000 yuan condolence payment? This is a matter of international importance. I hereby request your newspaper to make a correction immediately to avoid causing misunderstandings among my fellow countrymen. Sincerely, Mei Yaozong, June 8th. Correspondence address: 3362, West 5th Alley, Yinghua South Lane, Robert Road.</p>

<h3>The Silk Weaving and Embroidery Industry in Shanghai (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, No. 27)</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Sales: The sales of woven products cover both domestic and foreign markets. At its peak, the annual trade volume was about 10 million taels. In the domestic market, in addition to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the provinces of Pingjin and Northeast were the largest markets, accounting for almost half of the total amount. After the Shenyang Incident, the market was seized, the relationship increased, transportation and sales became difficult, and business plummeted by more than half, with only more than 2 million yuan per year.</p>
<p>After the late Qing Dynasty, there were also some exports to foreign countries, which were praised by Europeans and Americans and were happy to purchase. The annual export value was more than 3 million taels. It is reported that the exported embroidery products were mainly embroidered pillows, embroidered cushions, table cloths, and figures and scenery, and brocade and embroidered clothes were also welcome, as they were needed by people in foreign countries for historical costume dances. Qing Dynasty official robes were originally very delicate, and Westerners used them to make handbags, which were beautiful and practical. It is said that they have been almost completely collected in recent years. In addition, due to the global economic collapse, foreign sales have sharply decreased, with an annual value of only 100,000 to 1 million yuan in national currency, a decrease of 70% to 80% compared with 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Business Investigation: There were more than 100 embroidery businesses in Shanghai at the peak of their prosperity, with considerable profits. However, in the past ten years, disasters have occurred frequently, economic bankruptcy has occurred, and the market has become increasingly depressed. Business has plummeted, making it impossible to maintain operations, and many businesses have announced their closure or switched to other industries as a sideline. According to investigations, there are currently about 70 embroidery businesses, mainly engaged in embroidered screens, embroidered pillows, embroidered clothes, lace, tablecloths, and table covers. In addition to special operations, other embroidery products have generally become art decorations, and few people buy them. The following is a report on the larger ones:</p>
<p>Wan Li Yuan Gu Embroidery Shop, 98 Shanxi Road, Manager Liu Buyun; Mei Hua Art Company, 91 Shanxi Road, Manager Xu Baoxian; Rui Chang Xiang Embroidery Shop, 78 Shanxi Road; De Hua Su Embroidery Shop, 88 Shanxi Road, Manager Zou Jun; Zhou Fu Ji, 109 Shanxi Road, Manager Zhou Shangbin; Da Zhang Tai Gu Embroidery Shop, 283 Guangdong Road, Branch Shop 80 Shanxi Road; Xin Tai Xiang Gu Embroidery Shop, 110 Shanxi Road; Mei Zhang Gu Embroidery Shop, 87 Shanxi Road, Manager Dian Jun; Da Hua Su Xiang Embroidery Shop, 101 Shanxi Road; Shi Xin Chang Ji Su Xiang Embroidery Shop, 104 Shanxi Road; Cai Xiu Zhai Su Xiang Embroidery Shop, 63 Shanxi Road; Zhong Mei Yi Xiang Embroidery Shop, 393 Hankou Road; Wan Yuan Xiang Embroidery Shop, 411 Hankou Road; Jin Hua Li Xiang Embroidery Shop, 405 Hankou Road; Xin Feng Business, 10 Lane 27 Hankou Road, Manager He Dahong; Mei Hua Embroidery Company, 40 Broadway, Manager Qiu Menghua; Cheng Chang Company, 119 Broadway, Manager Lin Yinmao; Cheng Kang Company, 18 Broadway, Manager Li Zexiang; Yu Ji Company, 28 Broadway, Manager Huang Xilong; Xie Long Company, 78 Broadway; Wen Sheng Embroidery Company, 648 Broadway, Manager Zhu Zhongqi; Qi Chang Company, 12 Broadway, Manager Lin JinKun; Zhong Hua Drawnwork Company, 44 Broadway, Manager Weng Boliang; Zhen Hua Company, 36 Broadway, Manager Sun Jiaru; Mei Xin Company, 68 Broadway, Manager Xu Junyuan; Yi Jia Lace Company, 133 Broadway, Manager Hou Xiangliu; Heng Feng Company, 66 Broadway, Manager Zhang Dasan; Xun Ji, 84 Broadway, Manager Pan Xunyuan; Chang Feng Foreign Firm, 17 Guangdong Road, Manager Zhang Yinsheng; Da Hua Brocade Company, 664 Jing'an Temple Road; China Gu Embroidery Lace Company, 1195 Jing'an Temple Road; Wheeler Company, 1147 Jing'an Temple Road; Zhen Chao Company, 22 Tiantong Road, Manager Zhang Bohan; Kai Deng Company, 82 Lane 318 Tiantong Road, Manager Lin Shaokai; Standard Trading Company, 2105 Tongfu Road, Manager Zhao Zaisan; Kai Kai Foreign Firm, 97 Renji Road, Manager Li Yufang; Mai Su Foreign Firm, 320 Jiangxi Road, Manager Shen Peiren; Hua Xin Company, 103 Central Building, Sichuan Road, Manager Zhang Dongmou; Shi Hua Foreign Firm, 101 Nanjing Road; Fu Rong Company, 132 Nanjing Road, Manager Huang Shude; Xie Sheng Chang Hao, 125 Nanjing Road, Manager Li Jiansan; Ai Li Ba Xi Foreign Firm, 119 Nanjing Road, Manager Chen Houfu; Shuang Long Foreign Firm, 81 Renji Road; Mei Bai Le Foreign Firm, 81 Renji Road; Kai Deng Foreign Firm, 39 Edward Road; Wei Ji Company, 366 Tongfu Road; Chaozhou Company, 32 Lane 172 Kunshan Road; Mei Xing Company, 113 Central Building, Sichuan Road, Manager Sun Lengmang; Tian Ji Embroidery Company, 6 Lane 315 Xiafei Road; Qian Yuan Embroidery Company, 4 Jixiang Lane, Wanza Road; Yu Chang Pillow Embroidery Shop, 337 Yangshupu Road; De Chang Embroidery Company, 248 Yao Shengjiao Road, Manager Wang Xiangfu; Dai Zhufu, 158 Yao Zhujiao Road, Manager Dai Zhufu; Hua Embroidery Company, 222 North Suzhou Road; Yuan Li Gu Embroidery Shop, 12 Lane 449 Beijing Road; Tian Cheng Yong Embroidery Shop, 6 Lane 2 Beijing Road; Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory, 811 North Sichuan Road, Manager Du Jinsheng, Branch Shop 471 Hankou Road; Qi Wen Art Silk Weaving Factory, Penglukou, North Sichuan Road, Manager Ma Bin; Guo Hua Art Silk Weaving Factory, Zhaofuli, Hankou Road, Manager Luo Lican; West Lake Art Silk Weaving Factory, Furniture Department Agency of Sincere Company, Manager Luo Yixian; Xing Ye Art Silk Weaving Factory (Hangzhou), Manager Hu Banghan; Rong Cheng Silk Weaving Factory, Liuying Road, Zhabei. It is found that among the above-mentioned merchants, except for a few who operate wholesale alone, 70% to 80% are engaged in retail and wholesale. As for foreign merchants engaged in export, they are agents and transfer wholesale customers to Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>Overview of Embroidery Workers: Embroidery is a hand-made industry for women, so all embroidered items rely on women's short needle weaving to be completed. Therefore, the relationship between embroidery shops and embroidery workers is very close, but there are very few long-term hires. They are mostly issued and priced at any time. Moreover, embroidery workers are mostly women from towns and villages, except for a small number of women from the middle and lower classes in cities who do embroidery at home. It is because their lives are simple and their wages are low. It is said that in Suzhou, Changsha, Wenzhou, Shantou and other places, in addition to farming or going out to do business, women in the countryside do needlework at home. It is estimated that there are 30,000 to 40,000 people, and the daily embroidery income is enough to provide food and clothing. Moreover, those with high skills can still have savings. Therefore, there are not a few men who do not engage in proper business and rely on women at home for childbirth. In recent years, due to rural bankruptcy and the collapse of the social economy, the embroidery industry has plummeted. Embroidery shops have closed down, work has been reduced, and tens of thousands of female workers have nothing to live on. Even those who are lucky enough to get work are competing with each other, tending to fall in price and squeeze each other, resulting in poor export products and difficulty in marketing. Therefore, the embroidery industry is getting worse and worse.</p>

<h3>World Games Swimming Representatives: Chen Zhenxing and Yang Xiuqiong Selected</h3>
<p>The swimming athletes who will represent our country at the World Games have been selected. After the selection committee conducted tests on Chen Zhenxing, Yang Xiuqiong, and Guo Zhenheng in Hong Kong and Shanghai respectively, it has now officially selected Chen Zhenxing and Yang Xiuqiong to attend the competition.</p>
<h3>Criticism of Athletics Selection: Ma John Issues Statement; Athletics Representatives Train at Shen Garden Today; Song Junfu Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday and Makes Speech</h3>
<p>Our country's World Games athletics team was formed the day before yesterday. The athletics head coach, Ma John, designated them to start their final training before going abroad at 4:00 PM today. Yesterday, a reporter from Guoguang News Agency met with Mr. Ma John at De Lin Apartment, where he issued a statement on the selection process and important information. Also, Song Junfu and Xia Xiang, the managers and coaches of the World Games athletics team, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. A reporter from Guoguang News Agency reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>Athletics Training Begins Today</p>
<p>After the 15 members of the World Games athletics team, including Liu Changchun, were determined the day before yesterday, they were concentrated and lodged at De Lin Apartment. Athletics head coach Ma John designated them to start their final two weeks of training before going abroad at the Shen Garden Sports Ground on Yanping Road at 4:00 PM this afternoon. Representatives Liu Changchun and Lin Shaozhou returned to Beijing last night with Liu Mengji to sort out their luggage, and they will come to Shanghai this afternoon. Cheng Jinkuan has asked for leave due to personal matters, but he will also arrive soon. In addition, Oriental Magazine will take photos of all the representatives at 2:30 PM today.</p>
<p>Ma Makes Statement on Selection</p>
<p>There has been much dissatisfaction from all walks of life regarding this World Games preliminary selection. Yesterday, a reporter from Guoguang News Agency met with Mr. Ma John at De Lin Apartment. According to the conversation, there has been a lot of dissatisfaction from the outside world regarding this selection. I will humbly accept any mistakes, but I absolutely cannot admit that it was unfair. Also, because the number of representatives attending is limited, the selection committee members spent a lot of time deliberating during the selection process. For example, regarding the selection of decathlon representative Zhang Lingjia, the outside world believes that the selection was inappropriate. However, Zhang has a very good spirit of hard work and has a good understanding of psychology. Our country's participation in the World Games this time is mainly for observation, and participating in the decathlon will be more beneficial. Also, Zhang has decided to serve the sports community after returning to China, so he was selected this time. As for the selection of other representatives, they also have their own special strengths and advantages. In short, there was absolutely no favoritism in this selection. As for the participation of each representative in the World Games, they will participate in a maximum of two events. According to my observation, our country's 4x100m relay has a good chance of winning, and it has been decided that the four representatives Liu, Dai, Jia, and Fu will participate. The four are quite evenly matched in strength. Mr. Ma continued that he will convene a meeting of representatives this morning, and Song Junfu, Xia Xiang, and others will give instructions.</p>
<p>Song and Xia Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Song Junfu, the coach and manager of our World Games athletics team, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at about 2:00 PM on the Shun Da Wheel from Qingdao, especially for the training of the World Games representatives, which will begin today. Xia Xiang also rushed to Shanghai from his hometown of Danyang yesterday. Both are staying at De Lin Apartment. According to Mr. Song's conversation with a reporter from Guoguang News Agency, he is quite satisfied with the results of this athletics preliminary selection. Because training must begin tomorrow (i.e., today), I came from Qingdao to assist in everything. After the closing ceremony of the World Games, I will go to Europe and the United States with Mr. Ma John and Dong Shouyi to conduct inspections for reference. However, my vacation is not as long as Mr. Ma's, and I may return to China first.</p>
<h3>Our Country's World Games Soccer Team</h3>
<p>— Random Notes from a Trip to Europe, Written and Sent by Li Huitang</p>
<p>Suffering in the Longsi Car Compartment</p>
<p>After the Xinglong selection battle yesterday, the army moved to Surabaya again this morning (May 20). After breakfast at 6:00 AM, the train started at 7:00 AM. Longsi is about 400 kilometers apart, and the train took 11 hours to arrive. Riding a train in the tropical zone, under the scorching heat, crouching all day is the most painful thing. There is a lot of coal dust, and even if there is a breeze, it is still hot. We were extremely tired after the game yesterday, and today we suffered even more from the train ride, which was like adding frost to snow. What I saw in the car compartment was that the fields on both sides were connected, and the ridges were endless. The Dutch have special skills in water conservancy and irrigation, and the land here is fertile, so the agricultural products are abundant, which is unmatched by other places. Sometimes, in the small streams shaded by green trees, I can catch a glimpse of village women bathing and having fun in the natural bathroom without any cover. Don't laugh at the Malay village women, they are naturally raised, and their bodies are much healthier than our country's women. I remember when Nanhua toured the South a few years ago, Secretary Zeng Jun Jinghou had a poem saying, "Farm women are full of charm, Wearing light gauze to watch painted skirts, Borrowing a bit of white from pear blossoms, Their delicate posture is envied by those leaning on the building." From this, it can be seen that Malay women have their own moving charm. Every time the train arrives at a station, hawkers carry food on their heads and shout for sale. The prices of train food are extremely high. For the sake of economy, we all scramble to trade with the hawkers. The boredom of the whole day was finally spent in a state of half-awake and half-asleep fatigue. When I arrived at Surabaya Station, I saw thousands of lights. Those who came to greet us at the station were the staff of the Chinese Sports Association of the host and many representatives of overseas Chinese groups. I drove to the Ping An Ju Hotel to settle down. Twenty or so dirty bodies scrambled to take a bath. According to the order table, our team has three games in Surabaya. Surabaya is the largest market in Java, and its prosperity is no less than that of Batavia. The sugar industry relies on it for profits. We had a hard bath after the Sino-Japanese war, and after dinner, we rested in our residence and did not go out again.</p>
<p>Surabaya's First Battle: A Great Victory Over the Local Selection Team</p>
<p>Yesterday's train ride was hot and boring, and I slept soundly all night. This morning, the red sun was high in the sky, and many friends were still sleeping soundly. At 5:00 PM today (May 21), we made contact with the local selection team here. There were few spectators on this day, far less lively than in Balong. After 70 minutes, our team launched a swift attack and defeated the enemy team with a large score of 10 to 2, leaving no armor behind. The reasons why our team was able to achieve such outstanding results are: first, the strength of the other side was mediocre; second, the ball field was flat and soft, which was very conducive to our team's combat, unlike the ball field in Ruilong, which was troublesome and restricted movements, and all flexibility was lost; third, each member's performance was more improved. If it were not for the perfunctory work in the second half, the number of victories would not have been limited to this. The ball skills are quite similar to those of the Vietnamese in Saigon, but unfortunately their strength is insufficient. They will show their poverty at the end of the game, and they will not be able to cope with the situation. We can do whatever we want.

<h3>Dr. Yu Songyun Speaks on Midwifery Education</h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Songyun, the principal of the Shanghai-German Midwifery School in this city, was previously dispatched by the Central and Jiangsu Provincial Governments to inspect medical administration and health education in European and American countries. He has now completed his mission and returned to the country. The faculty, staff, and students of the school, along with all the doctors and staff of the Shanghai-German Hospital, held a welcome meeting in the school's auditorium at 8 PM the other day, and invited Mr. Yu to speak about his inspection. He said, roughly: The medical and health education in our country has not yet reached a fully developed stage. If we want to improve and develop it, we should investigate the current situation in advanced European and American countries to learn from them. This time, I was dispatched by the government, but I believe that midwifery is directly related to the people's birthrate and is crucial. Therefore, for the development of the school and the hospital, I paid special attention to it. Now I will tell you about the midwifery education in various countries. Among the European countries, Germany, Austria, and Sweden are the most developed in midwifery education. The age of admission is between 20 and 35 years old. In terms of admission qualifications, Germany and Austria require junior high school graduation or nursing graduation, and then be recommended by other institutions. Sweden only requires junior high school graduation. The length of study is two years in Germany and Austria, and 23 months in Sweden. During the study period in Germany and Austria, in addition to attending the required courses, each person must deliver more than 80 babies under the guidance of a chief midwife before participating in the graduation examination. In Sweden, one must deliver 100 babies before participating in the graduation examination. As for the curriculum, Germany and Austria used to teach forceps delivery and inversion, but these operations are now prohibited, and they are not allowed to inject oxytocin or hemostatic agents. Any pathological changes must be handled by a doctor. Sweden does not prohibit the use of forceps delivery and inversion. In summary, because Germany and Austria have a surplus of doctors, the powers of midwives are strictly restricted, but the government is still working hard to promote it and fully guarantee their status. The situation in Sweden is exactly the same as in our country, and the midwifery industry is actively developing. Sweden has a population of more than 6,142,000 people, and there are only 3,000 midwives, which is not enough. Therefore, they are still actively trying to increase it. Our country has a population of more than 450 million people, and there are only more than 2,000 midwives, which is even more lacking than Sweden. Therefore, in my opinion, the future and status of a midwife is more promising among women's occupations in our country. Then Mr. Yu presented four points of the school's improvement plan: To sign agreements with public and private medical and health institutions in this city to provide students with internship opportunities; To organize a youth service corps to consolidate the spirit of cooperation between teachers and students; To select the best parts of the curriculum from the investigation of various countries and incorporate them into the teaching materials to enrich students' knowledge; The school has been repeatedly praised by the Ministry of Education and the Bureau of Education for sending personnel to investigate, finding that the faculty is well-prepared, the equipment is complete, the school building is suitable, and the internship is rich. The school is flattered and will continue to do its best to enrich the content and strive to be a national model. Then the students performed a new drama, and the meeting ended happily.</p>

<h3>Securities - Environmental Impact - Public Debt Plunge Intensifies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, due to the Southwest issuing a mobilization order, Hunan Province suddenly felt pressure, and the situation became extremely dire. Spot goods flowed out of the market incessantly, and the pressure was already felt to be extraordinarily heavy. If the outflow continued, it would be unbearable. The market trend today is downward entirely due to the spot selling by strong players. All bond markets have seen new lows since the unified public bonds began trading, and the market sentiment shows no sign of recovery. An ominous cloud has gathered, and a fierce storm is raging.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the downward trend was severe from the opening bell. The selling pressure from various trading groups was overwhelming. Major players sold off in particularly large quantities. Market prices fell by seventy-eight cents to one dollar and eighty-five cents. Various retail investors and large quantities of spot goods flowed out, and the market felt significant pressure. There was no resistance in the second session, and the downward trend continued unabated. Series C, D, and E all broke through the 60 yuan mark, with Series D falling an additional dollar.</p>
<p>At the afternoon opening, the 11th continued to struggle to buy in, and retail investors also covered short positions, but spot goods continued to flow out. Although it勉强recovered by thirty or forty cents, the trend still felt weak. At the close, major players stopped absorbing, the bulls were unable to rally, and selling pressure was strong again. Series A even fell another sixty-five cents. The evening news was unfavorable, and there was still no sign of recovery. Due to the pressure from large quantities of spot goods, there is still a risk of a short squeeze this month. As a result, market prices uniformly plummeted, by one dollar and twenty cents to one dollar and ninety-five cents. The total trading volume was 14,430,500 yuan, a new record for the highest trading volume for unified public bonds. The results of the price changes are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Positive News Resurges - Yarn Market Experiences Sharp Rebound</h3>

Unexpectedly, the Hunan, Yunnan, and Sichuan groups were exceptionally enthusiastic about purchasing this yarn, and the selling price rose by one or two yuan accordingly. As a result, people's hearts were stirred up, and buying sentiment suddenly became fierce. The shorts, seeing the market hot and stable, frantically covered their positions, causing a sharp rebound. Market prices then stepped forward, with distant months rising by more than three yuan.</p>
<h3>Marked Yarn Offsets Short Positions, Rising by More Than Three Yuan</h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn pre-market, reports stated that Guangdong and Guangxi had issued mobilization orders, but the market did not show panic, and new sellers did not increase. The market actually appeared tight, because general retail shorts saw a good trend and actively offset their short positions. The market gradually moved forward. As a result, each month rose by one, two, three, four, five, and six cents compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon fourth session, it was heard that the sales of spot yarn were still very strong in Changsha, Sichuan, and other groups, and there was also awareness of the depreciation of Cantonese currency, and market news favored the bulls. Therefore, there were more buyers, the market sentiment was tight, and market prices gradually rose.

Brokers and Japanese merchants also entered, and each month rose by two to four points. There was not much hedging, and local groups and bulls tended to sell due to continuous rain in the east, and market prices slightly retreated. Afterwards, peers absorbed the selling volume, and short accounts offset their positions. Business was smooth, and the market trend was strong again. The close was very firm, with spot goods rising by one point, and futures rising by one to the upper point. British cotton spot goods rose by four points, and futures rose by two or three points.

<h3>Piece Goods - Fabric Prices Rise Rapidly</h3>
<p>Lower-Grade Goods Rise the Most, Showing that Purchasing Power is Increasingly Weak</p>

Anhui province purchased more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, patterned goods, and striped and plain Fuchou from this factory. At present, eastern fine cloth and gray cloth are the most popular, rising by two and a half cents to seven and a half cents per piece. Only fine diagonal twill is flat, because the Guangdong group does not move. Wholesale sales on the street are also strong, with more than 100 bales of fabric pieces being shipped out daily. Yesterday, the price of fine cloth on the market rose by five cents, and the price of fine diagonal set cloth was roughly the same as before.

Yesterday, Dafeng and other firms received clearance bills, and the bid price for B-grade white factory 20.22 strands was 650 yuan, while the holding price for Nanbu user silk delivery was between 660 yuan and 670 yuan, so manufacturers are still hesitant about this price.

<h3>1935 Annual Silk Export Report</h3>
<p>Export Volume Increases... Unfortunately, Quality Deteriorates</p>
<p>Eliminate Inferior Silk Exports... Implemented on July 1</p>
<p>According to the silk export report of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the total export of Shanghai raw silk in 1935 was 56,025 bales, an increase of 32,095 bales compared to last year, accounting for 13.40 percent. Among them, the export increase of white factory silk was the largest, accounting for 27,097 bales, followed by Zhili silk, with an increase of 2,526 bales, and then white soil silk, with an increase of 1,061 bales. The increase in yellow silk and others was relatively small. In terms of export locations, the Americas accounted for the most, with an increase of 18,402 bales compared to last year, followed by Europe, with an increase of 10,143 bales. In short, the raw silk export trade showed signs of turning from adversity to prosperity in 1935. However, it is heard that amidst this recovery of the silk industry, the raw silk exported from our country has been criticized by the international market due to its deteriorating quality, which is regrettable. Recently, the Ministry of Industry decided to implement quality inspection of exported raw silk to eliminate the export of poorly made raw silk and improve the overseas reputation of Chinese silk. It has ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to actively prepare and implement it on July 1 of this year. This is indeed an essential measure for the foreign trade of raw silk, and it is also a new opportunity for silk manufacturers to follow and strive for.</p>
<h3>Core-Drawn Zhenmei Is Continuously Purchased by Foreign Firms</h3>

<h3>Grain - The Current Situation Affects the Flour and Wheat Market</h3>
<p>Flour Rises by More Than Four Cents: Wheat Jumps by Seven or Eight Cents</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed a trend of fatigue followed by a rise. The quoted price of foreign wheat in both Chicago and Canada rose by eight cents to one cent and ten cents, and the weather had turned sunny, so the opening price of each month was slightly softer, slightly lower by one cent for the near term and half a cent for the distant term compared to the previous day. However, after the second session, due to domestic situational problems, rumors increased, and flour, as one of the military rations, once again aroused the enthusiasm of the bulls, and the opening price of each month rose again. Until the afternoon opening, because the rumors became more prevalent, people generally feared that domestic disputes would lead to international disputes, and once transportation was affected, so buying sentiment was strong, and the near and distant terms rose unanimously. New wheat has already been launched, and the annual harvest of wheat products is better than in previous years. This development is actually driven by the current situation.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, each month initially saw a decline, because the weather was good and people's minds relaxed. From this month to September, it had fallen by three, four, and five cents compared to the previous day. However, until the close, because the flour market rebounded and problems arose in the current situation, the opening price was brisk, recovering three or four cents from the previous session. Until the afternoon opening, it was initially calm, and then with the flour market rising step by step, general enthusiastic speculation also triggered a sudden purchase, and each month rose by seven or eight cents to one cent compared to the initial session in the morning, and also rose by six, seven, and eight cents compared to the previous day. At present, new wheat from various regions will be able to arrive smoothly in three or four days. However, the intentions of the guest groups are unusually firm. Yesterday, 70 bags of Hankou wheat were opened, with a price of 4 yuan and five cents, only at an 80% discount. Based on this speculation, high-quality goods should not be less than about two cents.</p>

<h3>Wang Xie</h3>
<p>- Su Zihan</p>
<p>The states during the Warring States period were all fighting for each other, and there was almost war every year. If two countries had a feud, then the war would never end.</p>
<p>At that time, King Min of Qi was immoral, and he was very tyrannical to his officials and people. He also wanted to become emperor and divide the world equally with the Qin state. When King Min of Qi called himself the Eastern Emperor, it was when King Kuai of Yan ceded the throne to Chancellor Zi Zhi. There was civil strife in the Yan state, and King Min of Qi took advantage of this opportunity to lead troops to attack the Yan state. The Yan state had been messed up by King Kuai of Yan and Zi Zhi, the soldiers did not want to fight, and the people did not want to defend the city. When the Qi soldiers came, they were unstoppable and occupied many cities. King Kuai of Yan was killed in battle, and Zi Zhi ran away, but he did not escape in the end. He was captured by the Qi army and minced into meat sauce. The remaining people of the Yan state established King Kuai of Yan's crown prince as king, who was King Zhao of Yan.</p>
<p>After King Zhao of Yan ascended the throne, he always remembered the hatred of King Min of Qi for killing his father and attacking his country. He always thought, "King Min of Qi is too unreasonable. He took advantage of the civil strife in my country to attack my country, kill my father, and occupy many cities. This revenge must be avenged. However, the Yan state is too small, and after a new defeat, if I want to recover, I must hire virtuous people from all over the world to do this work of saving the country."</p>
<p>Therefore, King Zhao of Yan treated virtuous people with courtesy, respected Guo Wei as a teacher, and repaired a house for Guo Wei to live in. The virtuous people of the world all knew that King Zhao of Yan was treating virtuous people with courtesy, wanting to avenge the country and avenge the national humiliation. Most of the virtuous people of the world went to the Yan state, such as Yue Yi from the Wei state, Zou Yan from the Qi state, and Ju Xin to the Zhao state.</p>
<p>In this way, more than twenty years passed. During these more than twenty years, King Zhao of Yan was very attentive to national affairs and not at all careless. He treated the people well and the soldiers well. It can truly be said that he shared weal and woe with the people and soldiers. King Zhao of Yan also appointed some virtuous people to manage all production undertakings and the undertakings of enriching the country and strengthening the army, and they managed them very well. The Yan state then became strong. In the twenty-eighth year of King Zhao of Yan, which was the fortieth year of King Min of Qi, King Zhao of Yan ordered Yue Yi to be the supreme general, uniting the troops of various countries to attack the Qi state, killing the Qi state's troops and horses and defeating them greatly. The troops of various countries returned, and Yue Yi led the troops of the Yan state alone into the territory of the Qi state, unstoppable all the way, and killed all the way into the capital of the Qi state, Linzi. King Min of Qi ran to Jucheng and was killed by Nao Chi, a general sent by the Chu state to save the Qi state. Yue Yi was in the Qi state for five years and obtained more than seventy cities of the Qi state, recovering all the lost land of the Yan state, except for the two cities of Ju and Jimo.</p>
<p>It is said that at that time there was a virtuous person in the Qi state named Wang Xie, who was very capable. Governing a country was not a difficult thing for him. Unfortunately, King Min of Qi could not use him, and he only ended up being a farmer in Jin Yi. Although King Min of Qi could not reuse Wang Xie, Wang Xie's reputation was very great, and many people in the country and abroad knew him.</p>
<p>When Yue Yi led the troops and horses into the territory of the Qi state, he ordered, "The virtuous person of the Qi state, Wang Xie, is said to be living in Jin Yi now. Within thirty miles around Jin Yi, our army is not allowed to disturb him. Those who disobey the order will be beheaded!"</p>
<p>Because of Wang Xie, Jin Yi was spared the disturbance of the Yan soldiers.</p>
<p>After a while, Yue Yi had already broken through many cities in the Qi state and obtained a lot of land. The capital of the Qi state had also been broken, and King Min of Qi had also been driven away. The Qi state was not far from being destroyed.</p>
<p>Yue Yi wanted to win over the hearts of the people of the Qi state, so that the cities he had obtained could be kept permanently. There was no better way to win over the hearts of the people than to use the local virtuous people. Therefore, Yue Yi thought of Wang Xie. He thought, "Needless to say, Wang Xie is a virtuous person. Because of him, I did not call the soldiers to go to Jin Yi, which can be considered to be worthy of him. I will now call someone to invite him out, and he will definitely agree."</p>
<p>Yue Yi's messenger arrived in Jin Yi, found Wang Xie's house, and found Wang Xie. He said to Wang Xie, "The junior general has received General Yue's order to invite you, sir. General Yue said, 'You, sir, are the first capable person in the Qi state. I especially invite you, sir, to be a consultant. After the Qi state is pacified, I will report to His Royal Highness the King of Yan and definitely seal you, sir, as a Marquis of Ten Thousand Households.'"</p>
<p>Wang Xie listened, and without any hesitation, immediately replied, "I am a person of the Qi state, and now the Qi state is about to be destroyed, and I am a person of a destroyed country. What use is there for a person of a destroyed country? I only wish to cultivate the land in the Qi state and do not wish to be an official of the Yan state."</p>
<p>Yue Yi's messenger tried to persuade him for a long time, saying so much that his tongue was dry and his lips were parched, but Wang Xie just did not agree. The messenger had no choice but to return to the camp.</p>
<p>Yue Yi's messenger returned to the camp and told Yue Yi what Wang Xie had said. Yue Yi listened and was very unhappy. He pondered for a while and thought of another idea. He then called the messenger again to invite Wang Xie. When he left, Yue Yi said a few words in the messenger's ear.</p>
<p>Yue Yi's messenger arrived in Jin Yi again, arrived at Wang Xie's house, and found Wang Xie again. He said to Wang Xie with a stern face, "The junior general has again received General Yue's order to invite you, sir. General Yue said, 'If you, sir, insist on not going out, I will lead the troops and horses to kill everyone in Jin Yi.' Sir, listen to the junior general's advice and it is better to go out. You will be an official again and protect the lives of the people in this place."</p>
<p>Yue Yi's intention was to intimidate Wang Xie. If Wang Xie was afraid, wouldn't he come out? Who knew that Wang Xie was not afraid of being intimidated.</p>
<p>When Wang Xie heard this, he looked up to the sky and sneered a few times, saying, "A person who loves his own country will never surrender to the enemy in order to become an official or because he is afraid of death. I am a person of the Qi state, and I love the Qi state. I will never leave the Qi state, and I wish the Qi state to be strong. It is a pity that His Royal Highness the King of Qi does not use me. If His Royal Highness the King of Qi used me, you would not come here. His Royal Highness the King of Qi does not use me, and I can only cultivate the land here, but I still do not leave the Qi state. Since the country is about to be destroyed, it is hateful that my strength is too small and the people's hearts are not aligned, and I cannot save the country. Rather than live as a slave of a destroyed country, it is better for you to boil me. There is no need to mention being an official of your Yan state. Fortunately, Yue Yi just wants to see me, this person. Taking my head to let him see is still the same. It also lets him know that the Qi state is not all traitors, but there are still people who cannot be tempted by wealth and honor and cannot be oppressed by force."</p>
<p>After Wang Xie finished speaking, he pushed Yue Yi's messenger out of the door and closed the door. He turned around and went inside, put on his clothes and hat, took a rope, walked to the backyard, looked for a tree, looked at it for a while, and then shouted loudly, "The Emperor of Heaven is above, the ancestors are above, Wang Xie's strength is too small, and he cannot save the country alive. He can only repay the country with death. After death, he must also fulfill his responsibility." After Wang Xie finished speaking, he climbed up the tree, tied his neck to the trunk with the rope, and struggled hard to break his neck.</p>
<p>Wang Xie's death stirred up many people, who all said, "Wang Xie is just an ordinary commoner, and he can do his best to be loyal to the country. What about us, big or small, who are still officials? We do not go to save the country, and we are truly ashamed to death!" Therefore, everyone ran to Jucheng, found King Min of Qi's crown prince, Fa Zhang, and established him as king, uniting with Tian Dan, who was defending Jimo, to fight against the Yan soldiers. Afterwards, Tian Dan used a counter-espionage plan to transfer Yue Yi away and used a fire ox plan to defeat the Yan soldiers, recovering all the lost cities and land, and the Qi state was still so big. All of this was stirred up by Wang Xie's loyalty and righteousness. Wang Xie did not die in vain.</p>
<h3>Isaac Merritt Singer (1811-1975)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Bao</p>
<p>—Sewing Machine Inventor— The Father Failed Due to Pessimism, The Son Succeeded Due to Optimism</p>
<p>Singer was born in New York, USA, in 1811. His father was a millwright. The family was poor and unable to afford much schooling. Singer had only learned a few characters when he was forced to drop out of school. On the day he left school, his father said to him with tears of sorrow: "Son, I know that making progress requires studying. When I was young, everyone said I was a genius, and I aspired to be an inventor. Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to study, and I don't understand any scientific principles, so I can only be a millwright! I finally have a smart and studious son like you. I should have supported you to study and become an adult. But we are so poor now that even eating bread is a problem. How can I let you go to school? Son, your future destiny may be worse than mine!..." He sobbed and couldn't speak.</p>
<p>At this time, Singer was already a teenager. He understood many human relationships and was optimistic and proactive. He believed his future was limitless, and he didn't want to listen to his father's words. If someone else had said it, he would have covered his ears and left long ago. But because it came from his poor father's mouth, he had to listen. Seeing the old man so sad, he had to express his sympathy. He hurried forward, wiping his father's tears and comforting him: "Son is confident in life, and destiny is in his own hands. Son will definitely succeed as an inventor. What Dad wanted to do but couldn't, Son can do for Dad. Don't worry, leave everything to Son."</p>
<p>The father felt a little relieved and looked at his son standing in front of him, saying slowly: "How can this work? You only have so little schooling!"</p>
<p>Singer said: "Reading is certainly improving the school for convenience. But for those who aspire to study, where can't they read? Why must they go to school? Besides, reading can only give us knowledge, not experience. Experience is indispensable for every inventor. Let me go out to make a living, learn how to live, and get more experience to prepare for invention. Burying oneself in books all day, not understanding what society needs, cannot stimulate the emotion of invention, prompting one to decide what to invent."</p>
<p>"Son, you're right!" the father said happily, "When I was young, although I aspired to be an inventor, because I had little experience, I didn't know the needs of society, and I never resolved to invent anything. Maybe it's because I didn't have a firm will, so I spent my life as a slave to life, achieving nothing? Son, you can take me as a warning. In the future, when you go out to work, learn everything happily and seek more experience. Don't be like me, frowning all day and treating everything as hard labor. As a result, working all year round, not only did I not gain experience, but I also ruined myself. Now I'm prematurely aging, and I can't do anything!" The father said here, with a bitter face, almost crying. Singer quickly diverted the topic, diverting his father's attention, letting him forget his unrepentant mistakes, so as not to suffer.</p>
<p>In fact, Singer had more difficulties than his father when he was younger. His father was able to study well for a few years and do an apprenticeship for a few years. Singer was forced to drop out of school, and as soon as he put down his books, he had to bear the burden of the family. In order to earn money immediately, he had no opportunity to do an apprenticeship and could only prepare to be a skilled worker, doing some unskilled rough work. Rough work takes a lot of effort and pays little, and few people are willing to do it. But Singer, with the determination to seek experience, was not afraid of hardship and worked hard. After doing it for seven years in one breath, he discovered that he was interested in machines, so he went to be a machine apprentice. After only four months of learning, the family had no income, forcing him to quit his apprenticeship and run around for food and clothing. He worked as a machinist in one state and as a clerk in another state: he spent a full nine years of wandering life.</p>
<p>In the process of wandering, Singer worked and studied machines at the same time. At the age of twenty-eight, he invented a rock-drilling machine, followed by a wood metal-carving Machine. After obtaining the patent rights, he raised money to open a factory to manufacture the machines he invented. Unexpectedly, his factory exploded not long after it opened, and the entire factory collapsed along with it, leaving Singer not only bankrupt but also in debt. His relatives and friends were sad for him, but he himself was optimistic as always. He said: "Failure is the mother of success." If I can not be discouraged by failure, and learn from this big lesson, I will study more carefully. Maybe I can grasp some great principles and invent something more valuable."</p>
<p>Singer had a friend named Di Bo'er, who worked in a machine factory in Boston. Seeing that Singer had nowhere to return, he invited him to work together. One evening with few stars, Di Bo'er took Singer's hand and went for a walk. They talked and laughed, unintentionally walking to a street of female seamstresses. There was an open space beside the street, piled with wood ready to build a house. Singer and Di Bo'er sat in the wood pile and talked. They talked enthusiastically about mechanical engineering, about each other's aspirations for invention. When they were happy, Di Bo'er said: "Singer, you are good, you have already invented two machines. I don't know when I will be able to make some achievements." Singer replied: "What is this worth? I never considered those two machines I created as inventions, because they have too little effect. When I can invent a machine that can benefit people all over the world, especially the poor, I will be satisfied. But I don't know what to invent now. You..."</p>
<p>It was almost midnight, and there were no pedestrians on the street. It was quiet all around, leaving only Singer's clear voice. Unexpectedly, someone suddenly sang nearby, the tune was sad and moving. Singer began to interrupt the topic and listened quietly. He only heard a sad woman's voice singing: Fingers are pierced, dare not say tired; Eyes are swollen and red, dare not be greedy for sleep. Poor seamstresses, hands inseparable from needle and thread, Thousands of stitches of hard sewing, One day, three meals, hard to get enough. Year after year, making wedding clothes for others, Who knows the bitterness in this! Singer was very moved and asked Di Bo'er with tears in his eyes: "Who is singing?"</p>
<p>Di Bo'er said coldly: "Don't you know this street is a street of female seamstresses? Who else would sing besides the female seamstresses?" Singer felt even more uncomfortable when he heard his indifferent tone. He couldn't help thinking: "Female seamstresses are also human beings, why are they so miserable, and no one is helping them; even a sentimental person like Di Bo'er doesn't know to express sympathy to them?..." He lowered his head and thought for a while, and suddenly came up with a reason. He asked Di Bo'er: "Is it okay for me to invent a sewing machine?"</p>
<p>Di Bo'er laughed and said: "I thought you were thinking about something, it turned out you were planning to help the female seamstresses!" At this time, the sky was cloudless and the moon was bright as a picture. Singer saw Di Bo'er's cunning smile very clearly. But he was not afraid of Di Bo'er making fun of him, and still said frankly: "I really have this intention, is it impossible?" Di Bo'er said: "It's not impossible, but it's definitely a difficult thing. In the past few decades, I don't know how many people have wanted to invent a sewing machine, but they all failed. — Maybe it's waiting for you to invent it." Di Bo'er gave another cunning smile. Singer said: "Don't joke, let's discuss the matter of inventing a sewing machine." The singing started again. Di Bo'er was afraid that the sentimental Singer would be sad again after hearing the sad tone, so he forcibly pulled him back to the factory.</p>
<p>Seeing that Singer was so enthusiastic about inventing a sewing machine and that his plan was well-organized, Di Bo'er borrowed forty yuan to give him as capital, and asked the factory owner to borrow a corner of the workshop to give him a place to experiment with inventing a sewing machine.</p>
<p>Singer was grateful for Di Bo'er's help, cherished his confidant, and worked even harder. He worked in the field early and late, sleeping only three or four hours a day and eating one meal. Even this meal was nothing more than two or three slices of bread and a cup of salt water. He held a hammer all day long, hammering machines, until two o'clock in the night before letting go, shrinking into a dormitory like a chicken coop to sleep. He jumped down to work before dawn. After several months of this, he saw that his machine could turn, bite cloth, and sew. He was overjoyed and ran out to tell people.</p>
<p>As soon as this news spread, many people ran out and surrounded Singer's workshop, asking Singer to perform for them. Singer was of course very happy to obey. Unexpectedly, during the performance, the machine suddenly became awkward with him and could not bite the cloth. When it could bite the cloth, it could not sew. At this time, some scolded him for lying and deceiving people, hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat. Some covered their mouths and snickered, mocking him in every possible way. Singer was so anxious that he was sweating profusely and had no way to defend himself. He was so ashamed and angry that he almost committed suicide. But thinking that his shame could not be washed away by suicide, he lowered his head and continued to work. After working hard for a few more months, he finally invented the sewing machine. At this time, all the people who used to laugh at him and scold him ran over to apologize and congratulate him. His sewing machine quickly became popular all over the world. How could the beneficiaries be limited to the female seamstress who sang sadly on that moonlit night?</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Textbook Compilation and Monopoly</h3>
<p>— Du Xiu</p>
<p>Recently, the author received a relatively reliable rumor that the compilation of textbooks will be handled exclusively by the Ministry of Education, and each bookstore will not be allowed to compile freely. The distribution of textbooks will be entrusted by the Ministry of Education to a certain bookstore for sale. Therefore, each bookstore is now vying for this monopoly issue.</p>
<p>The author does not know whether this news is true; even if it is true, the author does not know what the implementation method is. Because the nature of this event is too important, therefore, I dare to offer my humble opinions for the reference of the highest educational authorities and people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>The power to compile textbooks should be unified urgently. This is the author's consistent claim. However, it is easier to unify the power to compile, but it is difficult to ensure that the content is perfect after unification. Therefore, the problem lies in how to compile. Assuming that the needs of the national conditions, the conditions of the region, and the environment of children are not carefully considered, then the compiled textbooks will definitely not realize our ideals, this is one point; at the same time, the determination of the principles of textbook compilation depends on the careful discussion of experts, and the actual compilation work also requires all kinds of practical experience in teaching. How to take care of both parties when compiling is the second point; With the vast territory and ununified cultural level of our country, it is impossible to adapt to the needs of the whole country with one kind of textbook, so how can we make each region not feel difficulty, this is the third point. These three major issues are three prerequisites for compiling textbooks. Without proper statutory provisions for these three prerequisites, we can never imagine that the unified textbooks will have perfect results, this is regarding the compilation aspect.</p>
<p>After the textbooks are compiled, there is the issue of sales. The author believes that if a certain bookstore is entrusted with the exclusive sales, the disadvantages are endless, and it will definitely cause all kinds of unnecessary misunderstandings. The best way is that the Ministry of Education has a provision for any kind of textbook, all paper, typesetting, cover, font, etc., and the price is also set by the Ministry of Education. Any bookstore can publish and sell after being approved by the Ministry of Education, and a certain amount of royalties will be drawn according to the number of sales. The royalties drawn will be used as remuneration for the compilers of textbooks. This method can eliminate the hoarding after the exclusive sales of each bookstore; second, it can eliminate the competition of each bookstore; third, it can eliminate all kinds of unnecessary misunderstandings; third, it can reduce a little burden for general students and parents.</p>
<p>The unified compilation of textbooks and the sales issue after the unified compilation are indeed important matters and should be urgently realized. However, the implementation methods really need to be considered with great care.</p>
<h3>The Problems of Tomorrow's Kangzang, Yunnan and Guangxi (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wu Qiyun</p>
<p>By Fang Qiuwei, Published by World Publishing</p>
<p>Such a large Northeast is now taken by Japan; such a large Northwest, if Japan's westward policy is rapidly advanced, then it can also be serious immediately; if the Southwest is not set up with plans, this large Kangzang, Yunnan and Guangxi is also in the bag of the great powers. China's border problems did not occur today, but the state of serious danger is no greater than today!</p>
<p>At the same time, a country has a whole chain. The problem in the Northeast is not the issue of the survival of the Northeast, but the issue of the survival of the entire China; the Northwest is also the same, and the Southwest must be the same? Moreover, the international ties of the Northeast problem are still few. Once the Southwest problem occurs, it will inevitably involve the Northwest problem, forming a major conflict with the great powers related to the Far East. The result of the conflict is often to go to the road of partition through war or spoils, affecting the survival of the entire China!</p>
<p>To hope to solve the Southwest problem, we should start from understanding the Southwest and studying the Southwest. Then, the author respectfully recommends this book "The Problems of Tomorrow's Kangzang, Yunnan and Guangxi" to the general public.</p>
<p>The book starts from the inevitability of imperialists invading small and weak nations, and then analyzes the current situation of Tibet, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guangxi from a geographical point of view; then it talks about the history of British and French intrusions in the Southwest, as well as the current situation of invasion; finally, it adds a comprehensive comparison and analysis. After reading this book, not only can you get a general concept, but you can also get involved in specialized research. The book has 100,000 words and is priced at 50 cents, published by World Publishing. (End)</p>

<h3>Ten Commandments for Parents</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The National Children's Year Implementation Committee has recently drafted ten commandments for parents and issued them to all provinces and cities for implementation. This is indeed a good way to seek happiness for children. Parents are the guardians of children, so if we want children to become successful, we must pay close attention to the education of children by their parents. The National Children's Year Implementation Committee's issuance of ten commandments for parents this time is also intended for this purpose.</p>
<p>The ten commandments for parents are drafted very appropriately. To be a responsible parent, you must have these ten kinds of confidence. If the parents in the family can implement these commandments, it will definitely be of great benefit to the education of children. Therefore, we hope that parents in general can pay considerable attention to these ten commandments.</p>
<p>We want to divide the ten commandments for parents into two categories: upbringing and education. (1) To the extent possible, children should be given an appropriate material environment; (2) The clothing, food, and housing provided to children should be hygienic as the first condition; (3) Children should be made to live a happy life all day long. These three items are methods of upbringing. (4) In order to cultivate good habits in children, parents should set an example; (5) Parents should be absolutely trustworthy to children; (6) When children have conflicts with us, parents should reflect on themselves and see if there are any mistakes; (7) Deceiving, intimidating, or corporal punishment is definitely not a method of educating children; (8) Children should be often encouraged to admit their mistakes and not blame others; (9) Cultivate children's habit of serving society, or make them do something beneficial to society every day; (10) Cultivate children's concept of patriotism, and start by making children use domestic products. These seven items are methods of education.</p>
<p>Regarding the educational aspect, setting an example is indeed the best way for parents to educate children. A parent who wants to cultivate good character in children should start with themselves and set an example for the children. How can parents who cannot set an example guide children to learn well? Cultivating children's habit of serving society and cultivating children's concept of patriotism are also two very important points that parents in the family cannot but pay attention to.</p>
<p>Regarding the upbringing aspect, giving children an appropriate material environment is very necessary. But this point is easy to achieve in some affluent families. If ordinary poor parents, they are unable to do so. Who doesn't like to make their children live a comfortable life? But in poor families, the material environment is very bad. Children naturally have to suffer. The way to improve is to hope that society can give them some help.</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to the ten commandments, we hope that the parents in the family will not regard children as private property and do not belittle the status of children. Everyone should take responsibility and use the most appropriate methods to protect our children.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Son</h3>
<p>— Changfeng</p>
<p>When the third son died, Mr. Li was playing cards at the club. Mr. Li was already approaching forty. If the first son was still alive, perhaps Mr. Li could have a grandson. Whenever there was a happy event at the homes of relatives and friends, Mr. Li would immediately burst into tears thinking of his first son. "What evil did I do in my previous life? What evil?" He would grab something and smash it, "I can't keep even one son, I can't keep him!" Because Mrs. Li's second pregnancy was also a miscarriage, according to the maid, it was also a male fetus, with all its hair grown.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Li was not as anxious as Mr. Li. She was deceiving herself: "We are not seventy or one hundred, we are still young, what are we afraid of! I am also a male belly." When Mrs. Li smiled and patted her belly, Mr. Li seemed to be relieved again, putting on a smile and answering his wife: "We don't do anything wrong, are we really afraid of not having a son?"</p>
<p>But Mr. Li was never as natural as his wife. As soon as he turned around, the son problem twisted his heart again. It was at that time, under the urging of his wife and the persuasion of friends, that Mr. Li learned to play cards. He went to the club every day, putting the son problem and his thoughts on the white board to get rich.</p>
<p>In the year he turned forty, Mrs. Li became pregnant again. During that time, he played smoothly every day at the club. Knowing this news, he happily said:</p>
<p>"When luck comes, everything goes smoothly. It's not too late to have a son at forty!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Li naturally also smiled, as if she was already holding her son, answering her husband with certainty: "Isn't it? Jiang Taigong didn't marry until he was eighty! I am also a male belly, what are we afraid of? Don't let people know, you can make a small fortune at the card table!" (According to local customs, getting married or having a wife pregnant can guarantee victory when playing cards.)</p>
<p>Mr. Li really played smoothly every day. He was extremely happy, thinking in his heart all the time, "It must be a son! It will definitely be a son! Isn't this card game a sign?"</p>
<p>On the day of his birthday, his friends came to his house to congratulate him. They discovered that Mrs. Li's belly was as high as a small hill, wearing a cheongsam with unbuttoned buttons, walking in and out to greet the guests. While drinking happily, a friend who played cards with Mr. Li every day said; "Old Li has double happiness, no wonder his card playing is so smooth. Old Li, you are hiding it from us, do you think you should be punished or not?"</p>
<p>"Punish! Punish!" Everyone clapped and echoed.</p>
<p>"Punish! Punish!" Mr. Li was so proud, "I'll offer everyone a glass of wine, how about punishing one hundred red eggs?"</p>
<p>Mr. Li raised his neck, lifted his glass and drank it all in one gulp, clasping his fists with both hands and waving them on the table, almost as happy as when his eldest son was one month old. He got drunk that day.</p>
<p>A month later, Mrs. Li was in labor, and sure enough, it was a son.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Li had a son in his old age, his friends discussed having a big celebration when the baby was one month old. They came up with many tricks at the card table, and those who could sing prepared to sing, and those who couldn't asked the hall to sing; and for good luck, they entrusted the child to a friend with many children, and also prepared to hold a ceremony on the day of the one-month celebration.</p>
<p>But the third son did not grow up, and was often sick. One day, Mr. Li was playing cards at the club. The servant at home said that the child was seriously ill and asked him to go back. That day was one week away from the one-month celebration.</p>
<p>The child would not drink milk, nor would he cry. The doctors who were invited all shook their heads. They did not dare to give medicine to the child who was more than twenty days old, and even advised Mr. Li to invite an experienced child scholar girl to try. (Child scholar girls often used inexplicable folk methods to treat diseases.)</p>
<p>But those effective folk methods were not effective. The child only had a breath rolling in his throat, and he could no longer receive medicine. Two days before the one-month celebration, he ended his life, pushing Mr. Li from the peak of hope into a cold ice cellar. Mrs. Li also said disappointedly: "Are we really destined not to have children?"</p>
<p>Mr. Li's diet and sleep were irregular for several days, so naturally he did not go to the club to play cards. Those friends also dropped from the hot expectation point to the freezing point, thinking of ways to comfort Mr. Li as if it were their own business. Mr. Li could only walk around the room like a madman. When he grabbed something in his hand, he smashed it to pieces on the ground, as if that thing was the one that put his son in the ground.</p>
<p>"What evil did I do in my previous life! What evil!" He could only shout like this: "Those debt collectors! Unending debts! Unending debts!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Li also lost the energy of "I am a male belly" to comfort her husband. Three sons had not kept one, what was the use of "male belly"?</p>
<p>Afterwards, Mr. Li suddenly figured it out. If it was destined that he would not have a son, it could not be recovered by force. He still went to the club to play cards every day, or pulled his wife and friends to listen to operas. When he was happy, he would go to Hangzhou and Suzhou to stay for ten days and a half months. He seriously said to his wife from time to time: "It is destined that we will not have a son, let's enjoy ourselves! When our legs are stretched out, everything will belong to others. It is only bitter to be poor in old age!"</p>
<p>But the fourth son had taken root in his wife's belly again, and was rising day by day, piling up in front of Mr. Li like a small hill.</p>
<p>"Debt collector! Debt collector!" Mr. Li scolded as if he was arguing with someone. But the latent thought was also growing in his mind. It would not be more than two if it was not one, it would not be more than three if it was not two. Now it was the fourth one, perhaps he was destined to raise a son in his old age.</p>
<p>As his wife's belly rose day by day, Mr. Li became more and more uneasy. He was only living in contradictory thoughts, looking at his wife's "male belly" piled up in front of him...</p>
<h3>Small Electric Bulb Industry (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Voice</p>
<p>(Industry Survey) The electric bulb industry is divided into several types. There are large electric bulbs specifically for lighting; automobile bulbs specifically for cars; and small electric bulbs (i.e., beads) specifically for flashlights. Large-scale manufacturers naturally produce all kinds, but smaller ones mostly specialize in one or two types. Among these types of electric bulb industries, the capital for manufacturing small electric bulbs is the most flexible. It is said that some small factories can start manufacturing with a cash flow of only three to five hundred. Because the small electric bulb industry has the characteristics of a home craft, it is relatively easy to start. However, the manufacturing process of small electric bulbs is not much different from that of large electric bulbs. Don't underestimate it; when a small electric bulb is successfully manufactured and can light up in a flashlight, it truly goes through many steps and procedures involving numerous workers.</p>
<p>Now, I will present a concept of the work process of small electric bulb manufacturing, which is often overlooked.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>(1) Winding Tungsten Wire and Tungsten Bead Copper Wire: Winding tungsten wire is the first step. This work can be done by a lady. Because the tungsten winding machine uses a motor, even with a hand-cranked machine, tens of thousands can be wound per day. The work is light and the wage is high. These raw materials all come from abroad. It is said that German and Italian products are the best, and Japan also manufactures them. The price is very high, calculated by the meter. However, it is different for copper wire with beads; because it has different thicknesses, it is calculated by weight (pounds). The workers who make the beads hang the two ends of the copper wire on a bow, hold the back of the bow with one hand, and hold a colored glass rod with the other hand, placing it on an open flame to melt it. They wind a circle around the copper wire, and after it sticks, it looks like a small bead. Each copper wire needs to have thirty-five or six such beads. These workers are mostly female workers from elsewhere, and their wages are calculated per copper wire. About three jiao (a unit of Chinese currency) in legal tender is paid for every hundred wires completed. One can complete about one hundred thirty or forty wires per day. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening "Qin Liangyu"</p>
<p>The Ming Dynasty was in danger and the country was falling apart. Unexpectedly, there was a female general in Sichuan. Qin Liangyu, versed in both literature and martial arts. A sigh for a heroine who is not a professional soldier. Tracing back to her, when she was young, she received her father's teachings. The whole family trained as defenders. The brothers and sisters shared strategies. But she was a woman who did not yield to men. Furthermore, the Stone Pillar sought a phoenix spouse. Heroic sons and daughters united in marriage. A worthy couple of men and women. A generation of heroes passed on their famous name. Advise your husband, a good man should repay his aspirations. You must give your life to save the country and establish meritorious service. Imagine the battlefields filled with swords and halberds. The military orders are strict for the Baigan soldiers. At that time, the situation was complicated and changeable. The two defended against the enemy and no one could stop them. Banners fluttered and drums roared with mighty power. They were worthy of being called the wife of the lady general. How hateful that the eunuchs abused their power and trapped the people in hell. Qiancheng died and went to the underworld. Look at her, wearing mourning clothes and going to the army. She has the ambition to restore the Ming, but her wish has not been fulfilled. Fortunately, she was ordered to come to the capital to take over her post. Changing her clothes and removing her hairpins. A red-clad rider on a peach-colored horse. Green sleeves lining the clouds in the willow camp. I only saw her, the Sichuan brocade robe stained with battle blood. Rushing on the royal road to show loyalty. She also relieved the national crisis with her family wealth, generously donating money without hesitation. This is the uniqueness of the spiritual essence of heaven and earth. The heroic spirit of the mountains and rivers strengthens this person. Even admire her. The gift robe praised and passed down through the ages. Receiving the honor and commendation of the country. Furthermore, there are auspicious omens revealing the great virtue. A family of loyalty, righteousness, and happy martyrdom. Later, the treacherous officials dismissed her from her post. The collapse and disintegration of the country was a painful demise for the Ming. But I am filled with melancholy and worry as I reflect on the past. I only hope that we can work together to save the national soul. It is truly just talking about war on paper.</p>

<p>Opening "Dream of the Red Chamber" "Daiyu's Autumn Sadness"</p>
<p>The paulownia leaves fall on the first day of autumn. Daiyu is, touched by the scene, filled with a thousand emotions. I think, my delicate face is extremely thin. Melancholy and sickness, or excessive sleep. Just like the flowers and plants in summer. They lose their beauty in autumn. And then I think, the autumn moon is bleak and as pure as water. It moves the heart at first sight. Compared to Chang'e in the Guanghan Palace. She is not as good as her, she can escape the love affair of secular fate. Encountering, autumn rain for days without clearing. Her heart is depressed and her hatred is hard to fill. I resent, the rain master is unwilling to damage the autumn flowers. Day and night, the balsam is wet. There is also the autumn wind like gold and iron. Who pities the destruction of autumn trees? Like an autumn official enforcing the law. The massacre is too biased against innocent beauties. Seeing, the autumn geese flying alone high and far. The cries are sad in the sky. Just because I heard the sound of the bowstring. Therefore, fly into the clouds to avoid donating your life. Seeing again, the autumn swallows returning home quickly. Whispering goodbye without lingering. Listening again, the autumn insects chirping in the crowd. Like the autumn rain, it spreads throughout the world. Seeing more, the autumn dew is like a pearl, easily extinguished. Like bubbles in the water. Thinking that a lifetime is like morning dew.</p>

<p>It turns into empty sleep like twilight smoke. I, seeing things and grieving, my heart aches. I can't help it, tears hang from my eyes. It surpasses the spring cuckoo weeping blood.</p>

<h3>The Making of "The Good Earth"</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>There have been significant changes regarding Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's film "The Good Earth," which is about China. This new film recently began production in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Originally, the director intended for all the actors in this film to be Chinese and to speak Chinese. Now, there have been significant changes. Foreign actors are playing important roles, and the dialogue has been changed to English. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung, a Chinese farmer, and Iuice Ralner—now an Austrian star in Hollywood—plays Alan, Wang Lung's wife.</p>
<p>Paul Muni previously spent time with several overseas Chinese farmers in the Sacramento Valley to learn their personalities, farming techniques, and various movements. Ms. Ralner has also recently learned the movements and attitudes she needs to know. The director of this film is Fleming, and the famous European cinematographer Karl Freund is the cinematographer for this film.</p>
<p>American film circles have rumored that Paul Muni has mastered a lot of Chinese characters and can realistically express the character's personality, as well as the postures and gestures of Chinese farmers and other characteristics.</p>
<p>A Chinese-style avenue is now visible along the road from Los Angeles to Chatsworth City. A large space is used for the film "The Good Earth"; hundreds of Chinese people have been hired (not speaking) and are currently working in several miles of mountainous terrain, which includes farming tools from rural North China for irrigation of farmland.</p>
<p>Fields of wheat and rice have already been planted. The second half of the film's production must wait until the rice and wheat have grown. A Chinese-style town was specially designed and built by Chinese architects.</p>
<p>The screenplay for "The Good Earth" was adapted by Ms. Frances Marion and director George Hill. The assistant writers include Ms. Betty Wang, a former employee of the Shanghai Continental Daily, and Maurice Liu, who is from Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer "The Good Earth" crew arrived in Shanghai in January 1935 and spent six months filming in China. The main figures were Frank Messenger, Charles Haws, and George Clarke. George Hill committed suicide after returning to the United States. After they arrived in China, they shot a lot of outdoor scenes, mainly in Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou.</p>
<p>When the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer crew left Shanghai, they entrusted foreign lawyer Ouleman to help find actors in China. They posted advertisements in Shanghai and Tianjin, and hundreds of people applied, but only fifteen were not rejected. However, when the results of the trials of these fifteen people in Shanghai were sent to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, they were considered unsatisfactory, and they had no choice but to use foreign actors.</p>
<p>Since the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer crew left China and returned to the United States, Mr. Du Tingxiu, the representative of the Chinese government, has followed them and is stationed in Hollywood to monitor everything. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer authorities also asked him to stay there until the film is completed.</p>
<h3>"Torrent of Desire"</h3>
<p>Playing in Nanjing</p>
<h3>Jin Cheng to Open Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>And Add New Air Conditioners</p>
<p>The first-run cinemas in Shanghai that show Western films, such as Da Guangming, Cathay, and Nanjing, all have air conditioning, but among the theaters that show domestic films, only Jin Cheng has air conditioning. Jin Cheng's air conditioner was installed by air conditioning expert York Company; last summer, it won excellent public opinion. Everyone said that it was comparable to Da Guangming's air conditioning equipment. Now, in order to strive for excellence, they are sparing no expense and adding new air conditioners to make the air in the entire theater not dry or humid, but just right. They are currently working day and night to install it, and it will be open soon. As the weather gets warmer, this may be a piece of news that all Shanghai movie fans would like to hear.</p>
