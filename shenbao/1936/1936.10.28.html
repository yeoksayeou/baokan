<p>— 北平特信</p>
<p>—冀察政委會人事之變更—</p>
<p>一般觀察、日方對於冀察當局、近來煎迫、一若不似以前之甚、惟彼倡之已久的所謂「經濟合作」以及其他種種零星要求、在其龐大之駐軍威脅下、則不願稍稍停頓、並且急求其先付諸實行、然欲付諸實行、則當前之困難、卽為擔當的入選問題、於是冀察政治當局之部份變更與補充、乃為必然之趨勢、爰紀其人物如次、</p>
<p>李思浩　李之出任冀察政會經濟委員會主席事、接洽本在王克敏之前、王因阻礙重重、不能就任、邀李出任之　、因而復起、直至本月十日、李始由滬飛平、其時業已接洽成熟、故關係各方對之、皆不肯發表意見、甚至有以為李此次北來、係視察其本入所經營之大中銀行業務、不久卽行返滬、不料急轉直下、李被聘為經委會主席命、忽止式發表、且定於二三日內、卽行就職視事　十五日上午、乃正式到會就職、十八日下午赴津、在津共勾留二日、其間曾與田代·及日本駐屯軍高級幕僚、以至日本駐津總領事崛內干城等、分別商談、二十一日上午返平、溯李在北政府時代、屢任財政要職、十三年、段祺瑞當權時、李為轟動一時西原借欵之當事人、直至最近、在金融方面、仍具相當勢力、與日方之田代·崛內等、多屬老朋友、</p>
<p>陸宗輿　在北政府時代，數任顯職、民國八年、因對日交涉事、引起「五四」運動、陸與曹汝霖·章宗祥等、同為國人指摘之對象近年息隱津沾、自冀察政委會成立以來、曾有幾度出任某項職位之傳說、但迄未見諸實現、陸近年時時對外呼寃、以為民八之事、外人對彼實為誤會、以致有口難辯、然則此次出馬、亦未嘗非立功補過之千載一時機會也此間各方對於陸今後之措施、極為注目、</p>
<p>齊燮元　齊自江蘇督軍下野、卽來津息隱、去年七月間、華北事件發生以來、齊為律沽多數活動寓公中之一、冀察政委會方面、任齊為委員後、齊與冀察當局間關係、卽略有轉　、此次冀察富局之人事變更、原擬於政委會中設常委五人、而以齊與賈德耀·曹汝霖·秦德純·張自忠·等充任、後因曹表示不就始改變方針、由齊與賈秦等三人任「常川到會辦公委員」、以輔宋處埋一切、</p>
<p>石友三　石友三與宋哲元等一、十九軍人物、本係過去西北軍時之同袍、其後時勢　遷、各赴前程、而石之變動、尤為奇多、二十年天津事變及去年豐台白堅武謀叛、人皆歸過於石、而實際上石之活動、自九·一八陽瀋事變以來、亦確未停息、通緝之令、久已懸諸國門、今春、冀察當局鑑於種種環境與事實、將石與郝鵬·白堅武·等通緝令、同時取消、其後石與冀察當局間之關係、乃有甚大之轉變、直至最近、社會上對於石與齊燮元等在天津活動、又有許多傳說、於是本月十八日、此間當局乃發表石為冀北邊區保安司令、雖所轄不大、但亦表示當局借重之意、究竟石與齊等之名譽是吾可以趁機稍稍挽回、當俟石等今後之作為如何而定、</p>
<p>章士釗　章過去在北政府時代、曾任敎育總長等要職、冀察經委會主席問題、在王克敏·李思浩·張弧·等出任均形擱淺時、曾有邀章出任之說現經委會主席職、巳由李思浩充任、章亦出任冀察政委會委員、嗣又進一步繼鄧哲熙之後、任冀察政委會法制委員會主席之職矣、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國遠東政策的重估</h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>在目前中國對外關係上。英國給予着重要的影響。英國保護遠東市塲的政策。乃至它在世界舞台上一切經濟政治的活動。似乎都是和中國的　途息息相關的。</p>
<p>誰都知道。英國遠東政策的基調。在去年李滋羅斯來華的時候。就已有了好些顯著的表現。他回到倫敦之後。英國在遠東更來得活躍。我們撇開年來英國在長江及華南的投資活動不談。單說這幾個月的事悄吧。去年隨同李滋羅斯來華的英國著名貨幣專家羅傑士重來中國。據說是要繼承羅斯爵士的任務。新近英國出口貿易信用担保局派遣了保守黨議員巴特里克氏充任該局駐華代表。這件事的意義。我們一看也可以明白。至於傳說中的一千萬鎊放欵。不論將來如何實行。至少可以進一步推動中英的經濟關係的。此外。英國新聞界鉅子羅塞米爾勳爵本月初來遠東游歷。曾在寄回英國的電訊中極力鼓吹英國對於遠東貿易與航業有速加援助的必要。從上述英國朝野對於遠東問題的態度看來。我們覺得英國目前為本身利益的自衛。實在正和我們為民族生存的自衛。有着相當一致的利害關係。它的遠東政策的演進。無論如何是我們所不能忽視的。</p>
<p>再從歷史的過程看來。英國又曾左右過中國的市塲。可是歐戰以後它就接二連三的受到嚴重的打擊了。英日同盟的終止。顯然由於它自己深覺到養癰貽患。自從經過了九一八事變。不但它在中國的利益起了動搖。連印度澳州以及南洋一帶英人的地盤也成了遠東島國的箭垜。這在英人似乎也是初料所不及的。英國到了今日。不會沒有亡羊補牢的意思吧。</p>
<p>英國在世界外交舞台上。雖早有着九尾狐狸的徽號。可是自從羅斯東波了幾次。而被餉了閉門羹以後。它卻初則和蘇聯訂立了海軍協定。繼則又和法美實行着貨幣合作。它顯然是要在遠東市塲上以守為攻了。這種「以守為攻」的陣勢。從英國的立塲。為的是求暫時的安全。而從日本的觀點。則成了渴想突破的重大的難關。</p>
<p>我國目前所處的地位是淸淸楚楚的。我們應當認明了英國遠東政策的基調。來確定外交上適當的路錢。這纔可以防止遠東和平的破壞。挽救我們民族的危機。</p>

<h3>某方猜忌中　察北匪偽各部狀况</h3>
<p>王匪部旅長張某突被扣押　包卓張李在張北有所會商　某方嚴查行旅與禁止閱報</p>
<p>張北通信、察北匪偽各軍、自嘉卜寺會義後、聯合西進、窺犯綏東之聲浪、高唱入雲、惟迄今瞬及兼旬、察綏邊除不時發生小接觸外、並未見若何大舉暴動、究其原因、則以偽匪各部、因幕後策動人物、喜怒不時、喜則可得意外之賞、怒則地位身家莫保、因此其本身機構、已感不甚健全、再卽為兵額軍實、均尙待擴增、故遲遲迄未發動、</p>
<p>匪偽領袖集會張北</p>
<p>據熟悉察北情形者談、匪偽各部、自王英被某方懷疑後、最近將有一番大更動、偽防共自治軍司令名義、亦隨同王英而撤消、其前偽副司令張萬慶、本王英之步兵旅長、所部約有兩旅、已被遣散、又有王之旅長張某、日前由商都來張北、接洽領取軍火糧秣等事宜、不知因為何故、突被某方扣押、李守信部、日前巳有大股由張北向西北移動、現在滯進於大靑溝一帶、至李本人、則尙在張北、連日與牛羊羣旗王卓世海·右翼牧羣總管色楞那本濟勒·（名永誠）及張逆海鵬等會晤、對某項事有所商洽、又前鑲黃旗總管穆克登寳、（卽穆蓋華）現有接任偽蒙軍第七師師長之說、所部駐康保者、約數百人、最近將開駐嘉卜寺、所遺康保地區、將由包悅卿部接駐、蒙偽各軍、近來更調極忙、王英之偽防共自治軍司令名義、旣經取消、某方現准共改編為騎兵師、仍由王英任師長、由劉志謙·金年三·等分任旅長、該師編制、大約為兩旅、或亦有編為三旅之可能、</p>

<h3>慶祝蔣委長壽辰　蘇省獻飛機九架　明日在句容機場行命名禮　推定王柏齡為獻機總代表</h3>
<p>鎭江通訊、中國航空協會蘇省分會、為主持蘇省各界捐欵購機呈獻政府、為蔣委長五十壽辰紀念一事、籌備以來、積極進行、現已定於明（二十九）日在句容機塲舉行命名典禮、命名後卽直接飛京呈獻、茲將各情分誌如後、</p>
<p>籌備經過</p>
<p>蘇省各界聚欵購機祝壽辦法、前經蘇航分會决定、分黨政軍學商等團體分別進行、黨部由省黨部負責催繳、軍政警法由蘇省府負責催繳、敎學界由敎廳負責催繳、商界由各地商會及省商聯會負責催繳、規定欵額為七十二萬元、購機一隊、（九架）飛機由中央代購、欵項則陸續彙解中央、現已繳去五十餘萬元、</p>
<p>踴躍加入</p>
<p>本省各界獻機九架、但估計募集結果、僅可得洋七十餘萬元、而所訂飛機每架價値十萬元、該欵僅足購置七架、不完成一隊、似嫌美中不足、旋由本省農工童子軍及自由職業各界、自動發起、踴躍輸將、擔任此不足之數、以完成本省人民愛戴領袖之敬意、其餘私人方面、自動捐助者亦頗不少、</p>
<p>命名典禮</p>
<p>本省呈獻之飛機、定本月二十九日下午二時在句容飛機塲舉行命名典禮、並成立江蘇省獻機祝壽命名典禮籌備會、該會方面、日來工作異常緊張、籌委虞兆騏、昨已赴句着手佈置一切、關於九機之命名、已規定為（一）蘇商一、（二）蘇商二、（三）蘇商三、（四）蘇小學生、（四）蘇敎職員學生、（六）蘇黨政、（七）蘇政法軍警、（八）蘇農工、（九）蘇童軍及自由職業、</p>
<p>招待參加</p>
<p>籌備會為此項盛舉展慕在卽、前特函各縣政府各機關團體屆時派代表前往句容參加、並發出公吿、各縣所派參加獻機命名典禮代表、於二十九日上午到句容縣政府該會臨時辦事處報到、如途經鎭江者、可於二十八日到保安處報到、二十九日上午由會備車送往句容、並與省句路商定是日另開專車、以便參加者前往、</p>
<p>獻機代表</p>
<p>蘇省現已推定王委員柏齡為命名獻機全權總代表、在句容命名後、卽飛京晋獻、其餘省黨政機關及農工商學軍警等團體、均將派定代表參加典禮、現查已派定者、民廳秘書邱河淸·財廳秘書姚得臣·建廳秘書許體綱·敎廳秘書黃紹鴻、其餘農工商學等團體代表、亦將推定、</p>
<p>催繳捐款</p>
<p>本省獻機九架、欵項全係由各方面所集中、故繳欵程序極難一致、而商界獨捐機三架、尤足徵商人之熱擁護領袖、但以捐欵衆多之故，一時不易齊集、現聞本省航空協會方面、除商由各負責機關派員催繳已彙解中央五十餘萬元外、其餘之數、深盼能於最近期內將捐欵收齊送會、以便彙送中央、</p>

<h3>統一的青年修養（下）</h3>
<p>— 應觀</p>
<p>（一）確立一個自覺的中心概念這概念是發展我們健全的人格、所謂健全是無害的、平均發達的、調和的、完滿的意思、所謂人格包括身體·知識·技能·行為·情調·意志等一切人之所以為人形體的和精神的各方面、我們受敎育受訓練是要陶冶和發展道健全的人格、一切學科、作業、和活動、都是為實現這個大目的的手段之一、牠本體並不是一種目的、我們要努力體育、養成强健的體格、但體格强了是要憑之以培養豐富的知識和技能、養成健全的意志和品格、為社會和人類服務、不是白白地有了强壯身體能充當選手就算完事、每個靑年都應當樹立道樣一個自覺的概念、然後一切課程和作業都是為我所用、而我是一切工作和活動的主體、工作種類雖繁、我自抱定遠大的目的、按照一定的步驟、從容應付、不計成功、又何至慌張忙亂呢、從前談敎育的每將活動的範疇、分割為德·智·體三方面後來又有主張加上羣育和美育的、其實道德不是孤獨的、必然有羣的關係、美育也不能離開德智體三方面、無論三育或五育的說法總有點支離破碎、割裂分歧的毛病、現在應該屛除不談、單祗要在靑年意識上樹立一個發展健全人格的中心概念、使他心意鎭定、精神集中、才能努力學習、不至散漫凌亂、紛擾徬徨不知所措、</p>
<p>（二）節約學習時間有了統一的自覺的中心概念、第二步就是怎　節的學習底時間、現在高初中學生每日除上課、課外運動、活動等時間外、剩餘自習的時間是很少的、如果不講求節約和利用、必定更加感覺短促不够、有不少用功的學生晨早起來就讀書、課間課餘、飯前飯後甚至就寢前數分鐘也讀書、終日埋頭書本、實行分陰是惜的古訓、但這種辦法不能算是眞能利用時間、眞正利用時間的辦法先須有個限度、限度以內的時間應該很合理地分配、充分地利用、限度以外的時間應該完全用於休息和遊戲、休息是靜止的、遊戲是活躍的、休息時要酣暢地休息、遊戲時要歡暢地遊戲、在這種時候除了保持不使有反學習的作用外、絕對無所容心於學習、所謂反學習的作用、譬如我們在音樂課士依固定唱名法、學會了各種曲譜、在休息時、任意歌唱、以發舒胸懷固無不可、但不能將各音調底昔階高低任意變更、又如各種衛生習慣旣經明瞭和熟悉、在休息時就不能有任意吐痰等情形、仍應保持各種善良的習慣、總之、學習時間和休息時間應該截然劃分、斷斷不可有似學習非學習、似休息非休息的情景、攸攸忽忽將時間消磨過去、這是有百害而無一利的、這種合理的時間限度是多少呢、在沒有確當的實騐結果可依據以前、我們不得不假定初中及其同等學校每日為八小時、高中及某同等學校每日為九至十小時、至於連續學習時間最大的單位大約可採用沿襲的每課五十分鐘的辦法、就以五十分鐘為限、每畢習五十分鐘之後、須有五分十分或十五分鐘的休息、共長短應視作業底繁簡難易而定、不過中間總應有一個休息、以恢復學習的疲勞、現在初中學生照修正課程標準規定、每週上課三十一小時、又童子軍訓練課外一小時也和正課相等、則共為三十二小時、平均每日為五小時二十分鐘、以實足時間計之、　為四小時二十七分鐘、而自習時間應有三小時三十三分鐘、除晚間通例自習二小時、實合一小時四十分鐘外、尙須補足一小時五十七分的自習、大約早晨可以自習三十分鐘、其餘八十七分鐘多半須在午後酌量分配、高中照修正課程標準、每日平均上課九小時、實合四小時十分鐘、那就每日須有四小時五十分或五小時五十分的自習、支配尤覺繁忙、如果因身體或心理的關係、學習時精神不能集中或感　　　　勞、寗可稍减工作時間、但最低限度初中也不能少於七小時、高中也不能少於八小時或八小時半了　、除上課時有一定學習範圍外、自習時間底支配應就各科底預習和複習以及敎材分愛底多少、內容底雞易、每個靑年自已酌量自己的情形適當地分配、有一原則須遵守的、卽各科均須求其能達到及格的標準、有餘力再就自己所喜歡科目多看參考書、多做研究工作、關於時間底支配、最好每天自備一卡片、自早至晚、每次學習的科目（包括上課）和時間底起訖、於學習終了後、逐一登記、這樣隨時可以檢查各科時間的分配和一日總學習時間尙差多少應該補足、這事輕而易舉、開始稍加注意、後來自成習慣、等到各科時間底分配和學習總時間底限度都能從心所欲不踰矩的時候、自可無須再行登記、在無論何種學習的時候最應該注意的就是集中精神、專心致志地學習、絕不可使此心紛擾、胡思亂想、尤其上課的時候、靑年易犯的弊病、是有時對於不滿意的敎學不願意廳、須知學習是自己的受用、不是對人負責的、不應任令其作用中斷、致養成不良習慣、難以改正、</p>
<p>（三）抱定祗問耕耘不問收穫的態度現在靑年之患不在無目的、而在對目的求之過急、所以有了統一的自覺的概念、按照節約時間的辦法努力學習之後、就要急於求功、常常自己不能滿足、感覺煩悶、不知學問是累積的、斷沒有突發橫財驟然致富的道理、靑年應抱定祗問耕耘不問收穫的態度、擺定方針、穩打穩紮、那就人格修養自然可以日計不足而月計有餘、月計不足而歲計有餘了、（完）</p>

<h3>最近蘇俄體育概况</h3>
<p>— 宋如海</p>
<p>蘇俄聯邦，實為今日世界各國最堪注目底一個國度，該邦自一九　七年革命迄今，僅已十九年，而在此十九年中，凡社會經濟文化政治之急進與著效，在人類史上之速率，殊足驚人，較諸世界任何國家，所靡能及也。現在全國人民，都為「創造新天新地」的熱忱所鼓動，大家拚命向前，努力直追，全民一致地參加那所謂「共產社會主義的活動。蘇俄在未革命以前，誰都知道俄羅斯為歐州最落伍之民族，國家社會等等組織之不健全，敎育小普及，科學不發達，人民頽靡，迷信鬼神，階級鬥爭，種挨水火，諸如此類，舉不勝舉，這實為革命之種因。但革命後之蘇俄，由農產社會突然一躍而為工業社會，他事不言，卽就其國內鐵道路錢一端言之，現在已通達全國。此外令人最注目者，則為各城市偉大工廠，聳入雲際，並而林立櫛比，其建築之方式，均按最新科學方法結構架造。其次農民生活亦大加改善，全國農民已有五分之四組織集團農村合作社，其餘皆在從事仿傚，而農村中現有三十八萬五千五百餘架耕種機器。又蘇俄北冰洋破冰輪，每屆冬季開行北極探險，約有數起，尤其對於訓練駕駛飛機人員，每個大城均設有訓練處，一般民衆參加飛機上跳傘運動，約有十萬人，這是練習將來遇有外患之事發生，若輩即可用飛機侵入敵人境地，擾亂敵人後防，這種運動，現為歐洲各國最努力並而為最新式作戰之唯一趨向，又蘇俄火車路綫，直達於亞細亞中部，深入不毛之地，欲在無人之境，採用最新農業機器與電力，屯墾此種荒野之地，建立國有集團農村。當此猛進改造過程中，蘇俄不僅注重物質數量的加增，同時更對於人生目的，心理建設，家庭糾織，男女婚姻，社會敎育等等問題，都在不斷地謀求改造中。</p>
<p>當俄帝沙皇時代，是以帝國權威，統制弱小民族，這種民族，在俄國境內，約有一百八十九種之多。當時無不視之為奴隸，為臣妾，但革命後各弱小民族，都為蘇俄聯邦一視同仁之國民。現各族男女均享受同等敎育，彼輩於政治上亦有選權及被選舉，並且中央於各民族中，利用各邦文字，舉辦日報，設學校民衆戲院等等，在亞細亞中部，已設立一萬一千餘民衆學校，三百餘種日報，對社會敎育，尤為特別注意。各城市區內，設兒童生產登記所，公育兒童局，公園，公共體育塲，游洗池，溜冰塲，跳舞廳，音樂廳，工人俱樂部，兒童公園，少年先鋒營等。各大火車站，設立兒竄寄託所，凡婦女携帶兒童旅行者，由襁褓至八歲均可寄養其中，時間由六小時至二日之久，於是凡做母親的人，均極稱其便利。舉凡服務社會工作之設備，應有盡有，論蘇俄國土，佔世界面積六分之，擁有土地八百萬餘方里，人口約一百七十萬萬，種挨有一百八十九種之多，能如此協力共同聯絡　織這種新式共產社會國家，殊可令人欽佩。再由此簡略歷史背景述說現在體育發展之概况。</p>
<p>蘇俄領袖史丹林氏，對民衆講演，常用誠懇的言詞向民衆說：「人體構造，就是一種有生植的機器，吾人應該特別注意，把這個機器，全部使其健全起來，然後方可管理，使用人手所造各種機械機器。」誠哉斯言，蘇俄五年計劃，不但在社會經濟工農業發展有所驚人，卽於社會敎育與民衆體育亦顯有驚奇的成效，在此新制度下，工廠·農田·礦區，出品增加了數倍。國民教育程度，科學常識，工人技能，亦提高不少矣。全國各階級男女，都各盡其力去生產，各盡其能去趕造物質的供給，使各個人共同享受物質的快樂。勞工界於一九三九年產生一種新式運動，名曰Stakhanorite此項運動，風行全國各工廠，農村·礦區，以及政府機關，敎育界等處，Stakhanorite是一個煤礦區工人，他在掘礦工作時，特別努力他的每日出品，較比全礦區工人，加增一倍有餘。因此勞働界，即利用其工作速率，作個模範，發起此項運動，提倡工作時間速率，擴增工廠農田出品，自這種連動發起，不及二年之久，全國工農界，都是拼命前進，急起直追，個個人無不勤奮勞作，埋頭苦幹，而要得到這個尊榮名譽，若是工人得着這個名銜，所得工資亦加倍，平常工人，每日工資只一百五十羅布，（每羅布合國幣一元三角）若得此名後，每月工資可增至五百至一千羅布·從這種運動產生錄，勞工界特殊技能，每年增加數千餘人，工農礦山出產品，每年增加二倍，人民生活因此提高，在此種經濟發展時，當局認為提倡人民建康，實　不可少之途。</p>
<p>蘇俄於一九三〇年成立中央最高體育委員會，（Svpreme　Council　for　Phyoical　Tcainino）於各城市，各工廠，各礦區，各集團農村，各鐵路綫，各軍隊，各機關均設分會·對於體育之設施，有嚴密計劃，各處體育分會，於半年終結時，將其實　方法與成績，報吿中央體育委員會·中央並規定一種Efficiency　Test名曰B.G.T.O.（Beadvfor　Labour　and　Defence）為男女兒童由十四歲至十六歲，其二名曰Readv　for　Laboor　andDefence.e　G.T　O.為十六歲以上之靑年男女，其目的卽訓練靑年為勞工服務與國防之準備，此兩種體育效律試騐　準內規定運動項目計十四種如下圖：（待續）</p>

<h3>再談家庭訪問</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>日來報紙記載，有朋傳述，盛道上海國貨運動聯合會家庭訪問工作之勤劬，與入手艱難，而訪問員之自述，雖備訴訪問工作之不易，顧其志趣之堅定，精神之不懈，頗堪敬佩。</p>
<p>吾人認為家庭訪問不難，難在使各家庭明瞭訪問工作之重要。主婦為一家之主，孰無理智，孰無情感，孰願以日用所需，取給於舶來之品。苟各報隨時宣傳，播諸新聞，著為評論，或以文字鼓吹，或以圖畫表白，或善用廣吿，或採取攝影，俾家喻戶曉，人人知國貨訪問之不可少，此其一。次則無綫電台，於節目開始之前，或結束之後，善為紹介，相機通知，吿以訪問工作之趣味，則主婦可以先事明白，了然於胸，一旦到門，不致格格不入，此其二。復次則婦女團體如女靑年會，婦女節制會，上海婦女會等熱心諸女士，不憚煩勞，廣為紹介，俾各個家庭之主婦，熱心從事，而踴躍參加婦女服用國貨會，以自效於社會，此皆各方應有之助力。卽為五位女訪問員增進工作之效率。願此後各本愛國之忱，為國貨工業稍效涓埃之助也。</p>
<h3>大學生與國貨</h3>
<p>— 李轂君</p>
<p>提倡服用國貨，本來是一國國民應有的責任，尤其是一般有智識的國民，更應知道服用國貨的重要。可是我國的情形，却是呈着反常的現象，一般受高等敎育的大學生，他們對「服用國貨」這四字，却早已置之九霄雲外了。不信，我們只要參觀任何一個大學校，便可知道我的說話，是正確的了。現在讓我來報吿一般大學生實際的生活情形吧！</p>
<p>一、衣着方面：一般自命為不凡的大學生，他們普遍的心理，以為一進大學，非西裝革履，不以為榮，不足以顯其身份；再談到一般女學生，幾無一不畫眉點睛，燙其髮，高其跟，什麽喬琪紗，法國縐，…才能做為旗袍的衣料，否則有失摩登的規律，不足以表現其美麗。</p>
<p>二、飲食方面：學校明明有大廚房，合作社，可是價錢太賤，小菜太不合口，還有什麽幾人合為一桌的規矩，誰願意吃飯還要守規則呢？一班目光尖銳的飯店老板，為迎合大學生心理起見，規定一種飯票制度，一元可買五張六張，大菜票一元可買三張，各人旣可分食，味道當然合口了。更妙的，飯店的分類，還依照着大學生的藉貫呢？什麽廣東食堂，四川菜館，聖愛娜西餐社…美麗而動人的市招。</p>
<p>三、住的方面：一班小的地產商，為迎合大學生的心理起見，不明知大學生不願住宿校內，感着種種不便，遂相繼在大學校的近旁，建造起新式的小洋房，公寓似的宿舍，什麼衛生設備，一應俱全，一般享樂慣了的大學生，誰不願投宿於此。</p>
<p>四、行的方面：更不成為問題了！學校裏有的是校車，倘若以為不方便的話，只須煩你搖一個電話，不到五分鐘，汽車行會放一輛汽車來的，就是什麼電車，公共汽車，亦非頭等不坐。</p>
<p>我們看了以上的情形，大學生的生活，是多麽的令人慕羨啊！不，完全是洋化，試問他們日常的生活，還管國家對他們約期望嗎？他們已忘記了父兄當他臨行時的囑咐，更談不到提倡「服用國貨」了。</p>
<p>根據民國十九年敎育部的統計，中國每一萬人中，只有一個大學生，倘若我國的人口是四萬萬五千萬人，受高等敎育的人—大學生—只不過四萬五千人，唉！倘若每一個大學生，平均穿一襲西裝，每襲定價為三十元（註：大學生當然不是個個人穿西裝的，女生就是例外，但我們的計算，是假設為每人一套西裝，包括女生的衣服，胭脂以及男女大學生的無益的消耗等費用）每年巳經漏巵一三五〇〇〇〇元了！這是多麽驚人的一件事啊！</p>
<p>我們要防止大學生的浪費，惟有哀求那大學校的當局者和一般家長，以身作則，取締大學生衣，食，住，等不合法的消費，這樣一來，才可走上「服用國貨」的正軌呢？</p>
<h3>介紹中國國貨推行所</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>近來國貨界似乎沒有什可以欣喜的消息，加之走私的猖獗更覺得隱憂無巳。可是我們要知道努力於國貨的人，還是有不少在埋頭苦幹着。我們應當「祗問耕耘，不問收穫」。譬如蘇州的中國國貨推行所，便是在內地的一個有力的集團，所以國貨前途，我們應該是樂觀的</p>
<p>國貨推行所的主持人，是魏師達君，是一位交通大學工學士。並且聘用許多受過職業訓練的人員，佐理其事，魏君前任吳縣及東海縣建設局長，是一位有科學頭腦而極熱心於國貨事業的人，他丟開了仕途來幹這吃力難討好的社會事業，可想見此君的抱負了。</p>
<p>他們的工作，一方面固然是代國貨廠家計劃推銷經理出品，同時另一方面，更注意市况的調查，用戶意見的收集，這都是其他國貨團體所未有的，其餘關於出品的硏究，接受代辦的委託，都是他們應有的任務，總之他們一切　做到科學管理，實事求是，而不重誇大的宣傳，不以利益為目的。</p>
<p>他們的眼光，幾有許多獨到處，他們把所址設在蘇州，是預備先從蘇州附近六縣做一個單位實騐區，將來再逐漸推廣到各內地去，他們所以不在上海設立，便因為上海僅可與出品廠家接近，同時宣傳方面便利而已。對於推行自應與消費者求連繫，這尤足見中持人思考之周密，着眼之遠大。</p>
<p>介紹略盡於此，最後我希望他們慢慢的將區域擴大起來，更希望他們以精密調查所得，貢獻給出口廠家，將來能就地設廠，勿令全國輕工業完全集中上海一埠，否則前途實有無限危機。</p>
<p>注：中國國貨推行所址在蘇州盤門內</p>
<h3>介紹國產啤酒瓶</h3>
<p>— 玉樹</p>
<p>國產啤酒，自有烟台及五星等問世後，因其品質的優美，每年有很大的銷路，給舶來品一個嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>但是國產啤酒感覺到美中不足的，就是酒瓶的都是洋貨，因為啤酒製造的程序，在啤酒裝入瓶後，須經過熱度很高的幾次蒸發，普通瓶子不能耐熱，就要爆烈，所以不能不採用洋貨。</p>
<p>因這酒瓶的問題，國產啤酒常易引起熱心服用國貨者的懷疑，所以有的廠家是特在酒瓶上附黏聲明書，以釋誤會，但道究竟是麻煩的工作。</p>
<p>最近據說晶華玻璃廠有此啤酒瓶出品了。這一方面可以减少許多漏巵，同時也可提高國產啤酒的價値。</p>
<p>希望自下年度起國產啤酒都採用國產酒瓶！</p>
<h3>一週間國貨新訊</h3>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （太玄）</p>
<p>雞生蛋，再由蛋孵成籬雞，這是大家都知道的，但是我們要進一步去推究牠，還是先有雞呢？還是先有蛋呢？這問題就不容易解釋了。因為沒有雞，就無從生蛋，沒有蛋，雞又從何來呢有人說，家禽都是卵生的，不錯，惟其是卵生的，纔成了難題費解啊</p>
<p>「生於憂患，死於安樂」。今誰不願意度着安樂生活，人誰不從衣食住二項中掙扎着去求生活，因為人人多在掙扎中求牛活，那生活的產額，就在天天儘量地開拓着，於是發生了競爭；人有智愚强弱之分，競爭的結果，當然是優勝劣敗。人與人之間如是，國與國間亦如是，因為一個國家的人民，在自國生活的開拓，感到供不應求時，它的目標就轉移到隣近的別一國身上上去了，這就呌做「侵略」。我們現在正被陷落入在該環境內，所以我們人人處於憂患之中，為着求我們的生活，祗有不斷的努力奮鬥！</p>
<h3>愛克司光下女子的解放</h3>
<p>— 爽迷</p>
<p>這裏、我們可以明瞭現代女子，在她們的奮鬥和努力的環境中，獲到的所謂『解放』的一種驚人的成績。事實上，這聲浪雖已經有許多年頭呼嘆着，然而依舊是表面上的『裝飾品』，我們於其說『解放』，不如爽辣的說它『摩登的傀儡』好咧、</p>
<p>茲將所謂『解放』也者，剖解如下：</p>
<p>髮——因為是『剪』的緣故，狠少瞧見粗長的辮子了！</p>
<p>耳——解放穿環的麻煩手續。</p>
<p>眼——會運用一種『媚』的引誘力，能正面的看人了！</p>
<p>眉——改細且長，這是掩護眼的美觀！</p>
<p>頰——經過了美容院的手術，很少再塗上二分厚含有多量石灰質的鉛粉了！</p>
<p>嘴——能在男子跟前流利的辯論了！</p>
<p>齒——至少要學會嚼露蘭香糖的小技能。</p>
<p>唇——在Ｋiss時表演着美的姿態。</p>
<p>胸——不束胸的原因，透露了它的高度。</p>
<p>腿——不穿襪，是一種『肉的貢獻』。</p>
<p>脚——像滿洲婦人般『踏高蹺』走路了。</p>
<p>這不過是『趨向』而已，因為女子的解放，根本須隨時代的進展而進展的啊！</p>
<h3>逐客令</h3>
<p>— 顯微生</p>
<p>作者幼時，嘗聞父老言：俗有『逐客』之法，頗有奇效。譬如家要來了個『爛凳脚』的朋友。纏擾得還不想走，主人於唯唯吾吾之間，只要暗地裏呌家人用掃帚一柄，倚在門背後，那個討厭朋友，自會得興起『歸念』，吿辭而去。惟這事近荒誕，我以為未堪憑信。現在我說的『逐客令』，旣不形諸辭色。亦無須掮槍弄棒，號令一出，客人自會得識相溜走。</p>
<p>從前，朝官塲往，有個俗例，就是官官相會，絕忌多說『閒』話，幾句要言設開，就得辭出；尤其是下峯對上峯，最要注意這一點。所以賓主談話之間，要是你聽到一聲『送茶』，你快些識相，馬上也喊『提轎』，興辭而走。因為名為『送茶』，實則就是催你快點『滾蛋』。</p>
<p>年底裏，番場老板謂了幾個彈詞家，依决登臺的說會書，這那一個說開，換上那一個再來說，說得那個最『發鬆』，就是誰最有『本領』，正書倒說得很短，完全是以『噱頭』多者為勝。這時候，說者倘本領『次』一些，說得不大好聽，博不到聽衆的歡迎，對不起，臺下『倒面水』或『絞手巾』的呼聲，就要隨之而起。不過，這個口號一出，聽上朋友，還是識相些，『下候等』脚裏明白的好，否則，或許會弄得你還要『沒趣』哩！</p>
<h3>小玲子與生梨</h3>
<p>— 曼子</p>
<p>我看了明星公司的「小玲子」，以為和這幾天常嚼的生梨是同一滋味的，爽脆甜嫩，非常的輕鬆明朗，在舌根上感到快感，而最後咬看心，却有了一股酸。這是指故事而言。</p>
<p>全片的演出，是有着彈性的，在故事的進展，一點不黏着，膩住，很流利的過去，却處處有些反激，這反激又是用輕鬆的手法去映射出來，要人們在細微處領略體會的。這和生梨的特質很相似的，所以荔枝可以日啖三百顆，而生梨要一片一片細嚼的。</p>
<p>表演和技巧，可說是完全一致，所以沒有過於誇示的塲面，沒有故意起噱的穿挿，無論極小的動作，極大的意義，都是很自然地演出，很生動地表表襮。蘇東坡所不得不行，止乎其所不得不止」。導演就得到這個訣竅。</p>
<p>一般人批評中國電影，總是說太像文明戲，文明戲的弊病，就是為說話而說話，往往不顧劇情的。小玲子的對白，能够適合劇情，應當快的時候絕不遲滯，應當慢的地方絕不滑溜，它的高低强弱，隨着劇情的進展，　表演的旋律是一致的。</p>
<p>這片子不僅在明星公司是別具風格，並且在過去的國產影片裏，也是創作。程步高在「新舊上海」已顯出他轉變的手法，在小玲子父是一個轉變。</p>
<p>這幾天可稱「生梨季節」，那末生梨般的「小玲子」，正是我們極需要的一種，眼皮供養了。所以拋開意識講，也是一個雋品。</p>

<p>第七回　手足情高匿函憐弱妹　詩書氣重窺影笑寒儒</p>
<p>因伸頭凑着珍珠蘭聞了一聞，笑道：表哥很喜歡淡綠的顏色嗎？國器道：何以見得？友梅道：因為蘭花是淡綠。國器笑道：原來是這樣推想下去的。其實我對於蘭花，也不過如此。我對於靜而不過分妖艷的花，我都愛的。友梅道：花不是越美麗越好嗎？為什麽過分美麗的，你又不愛呢？國器笑道：那就為的是李女士說的詩書氣重了。友梅看他雖是不住的說笑着，然而穿了長衣，端端正正的坐着，究不能十分自然。尤其他額頭上微微的冒了汗珠子，可以看出人家的不耐。這就站起來道：伯母，我們還是到外面望屋裏去坐罷。表哥，你還是作你的功課。國器道：外面屋干雖有風，可還不及這裏邊屋子陰凉。友梅笑道。。表哥，我看你不必客氣了。我在這裏坐，你旣不能脫長衣。你陪了我們到外面來坐，也得把長衣套上。作客的未免太不知趣。我倒有好些事，要在表哥面前討敎。只是下决來，表哥不要和我太客氣才好。國器倒找不出什麽話，來答復他，只有微笑。只好不出來陪客了。友梅到了堂屋裏，隔了一道竹簾，還不住了對裏而望着。那一條白衣服影子，先還有些閃動，後來就不見了，而且連同什麽聲音也都沒有了。友梅同章老太談了兩小時的話，太陽巳是偏西，便起身吿辭。章老太將他送到天井裏時，他却回轉身，走到書房呢戶邊，先呌道：表哥，我走了，下次見。說着話，把懸的竹簾干掀了起來。這却看到他伏在書案上，將一張很精美的洋信紙，放在面前，用鋼筆蘸着藍墨水寫信。而寫的字，還是英文。這一點學生們所認為很平常的事，偏是在他腦筋裏留下一個印像，他自覺着是不虛此行的了？（九一）</p>
<h3>蟹的雜話</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>中秋一過，蟹立刻代替月餅而上市，又是一個吃蟹的時節了。在上海這都市中，我們在蟹攤千上，到處可以看見有洋澄湖大蟹的出售，世我總覺得買來的蟹，肉　而味淡，遠沒有我鄉松江所產的蟹來得鮮美。</p>
<p>原因就為了我們家鄉所產的蟹，雖然沒有上海市上所謂洋澄湖蟹的碩大，但以滋味說來，却比洋澄湖蟹要鮮美得多。好久沒有嘗到家鄕的蟹味，直到去年，家裏寄了一筐蟹來，我便把洋澄湖蟹當塲比較一下；的確，我們家鄉的蟹味道可口得多，所以我的吃蟹主張，不在大小，而在蟹肉是否鮮美。</p>
<p>故鄉的漁翁，一到秋天。便大家振作了精神，集中於捕蟹的工作。有的用網牽，有的用蟹　張，弄得好一個蟹市可捉到幾百元的蟹；也是一筆巨大的牧入；不過捉蟹每在夜晚時節，張燈佈網，警夜不眠，也是非常辛苦的。</p>
<p>我們在年幼時，吃了蟹一定要把蟹骰留下來，放在一隻炭　裏面，走到河　，把炭　沉河底去，不消一刻鐘，把炭　拿起來，時常可以捉到幾條鰻鯉，小魚之類，當做一種消遣。</p>
<p>蟹殼留下來洗凈晒乾之後，研了末，放在蒼术白芷裏燒起來，把窗門統統關緊了，那全間屋內所有的臭蟲，在兩小時內可以立斃，是殺除臭蟲的一種良法，不過燒的時候人要走開的、</p>

<h3>最經濟的婦女新裝</h3>
<p>— 藕絲</p>
<p>上海是中國的最大銷金之窟，一般貴官富賈以及紈褲子弟都喜歡將當初聚斂所得的金錢整批的運到上海來用，更大部份在女人身上，而伊門的錢又完全消耗在衣飾項下。女孩兒家愛好天然，本來就專愛在衣飾方面爭妍鬥艷，反正伊們購備心愛的物品，自有人心悅誠服的搶着代付貨欵，不必自掏腰包，樂得慷他人之慨，窮奢極欲，任意浪費。就是萬不得已，有時必需動用個人的私蓄，好在她們的錢來得，也正不妨揮金如土，不甚愛惜，富家嬌女，北里妖姬，取精用宏侈過度，原是題中應有之義，可是，有些小家碧玉，看慣了金閨名縱豪華的樣兒，禁不住物質的誘惑，也就眼紅心熱，不肯安守本分，刻意的婢學夫人，想沾染點綺羅之香，惟恐亂頭糊服，埋沒了伊們的天生麗質。金珠，翡翠，鑽石，價値鉅萬，窮人當然可望而不可及，惟有衣服一項，或者可以費盡九牛二虎之力，勉強東拼西凑，購製一二件，讓伊們去捧心效西子一顰。因此，上海的綢緞店，成衣匠都靠女人唯一的大主顧，近十年來，更有所謂新裝公司一也者，應運而生，一時間風起雲湧，平添了好幾十家，每一家都生意與隆財源茂盛，公認為目下最容易賺錢的好買賣。有許多美術家，學非所用，用違所長，在中國，藝術是不能變飯吃的，趁著機會，就紛紛投效到新裝公司中，做繪圖設計的打樣師了。</p>
<p>在新裝公司創辦之初，確能對症下藥，利市十倍，因「衣不壓新」，自古巳然，那些摩登女性，選探華美衣料，業已登峯造極，無可揀精挑肥了，祗好另起爐灶，在形式上力求新奇，正非常需要人能替伊們出主意翻花樣，多花幾個錢，倒一點兒也不在乎。聽說，那時一件極平常的藍布旗袍，經新裝公司一番手續，居然要賣到十二三元，質料貴重的，每件從幾十元到幾百元，更是常見之事。在上海，祗有女人們的錢，最容易騙！以前，女人的衣服，雖然常常換花樣，但尙可保持現狀到一兩年之久，近來，却像飛一樣的進步了，等不到二五個月，巳經齊一變，魯一變，變得神妙莫測了；春天做的新裝，到秋天再穿了出去，就要被大衆譏笑是古代的怪物過時的舊樣了。所以，婦女的衣服，做好之後，就不值錢；幾十塊錢做的，那怕尙無嶄新的不曾穿過，送到長生庫中，能够當到一兩塊錢，就算是好的了，最近，索興不肯收當了，就因為式樣變得太快，如果滿期不贖，除了送到古物陳列　以外，更無別法啊！</p>
<p>不過，近一兩年，新裝公司，也已成為強弩之末了，這無非受了不景氣的影響，民窮財盡的今日，除了少數無產階級，誰還有餘力供給嬌妻膩友裝修六面呢？今年夏天因時勢的需要便　明了一種極經濟的新裝，祗消花一元幾角錢，就可以剪幾尺黑香雲云雲紗，做一件旗袍，從大家名媛歌舞明星，北里名花，到擱樓裏的嫂嫂，一不必再穿別的衣服，衹要被一條三角短褲，連褲子都可以省却，裸着腿，亦着脚，套一雙露着鮮紅的蔻丹的腳趾頭的皮鞋，一共衹花五六元錢，渾身上下，業已應有盡有，儼然就是一個極漂亮的摩登姑娘了，這是何等的價廉物美啊！</p>
<p>假使單從表面觀察，這未嘗不是提俱節的聲中的好消息，但是，每件衣料所費不過一二元，而裁縫工錢却要花　兩三元以上，大有頭重脚輕的趨勢！瞎！酷慕虛榮，歡喜浪費的上海婦女，竟會從省錢方面着想，新裝之上，忽然加添經濟二字，社會金融涸竭的程度，也就可想而知了！</p>

<p>橫濱日絲抬價愈形挺秀　　絲原料缺乏引為憾事此次絲價迭漲、有如靑雲直上、據某西商云、係最近美法兩大生絲消費國政局日趨穩定之故、蓋法國自貨幣貶値、及與英美等國締結金融協定後、法滙漸穩、其國內實　亦逐呈復蘇、故申埠法镅前兩月來無甚建樹、至最近則問訊股殷、不亞美莊、紐的力面、因總統選舉卽將事竣、而羅氏之政治地位、或能不變、故一般商業亦不若月前之滯疑猶豫、生絲實銷乃”活動、而橫　則趁機抬價、日見挺秀、截至昨日止、現貨已破八百元關而至八百零五元、此等高價、為今春三月一份後、七個月來之最高紀錄、同時昨日紐的近期一猛漲六分、生絲成交四千包左右、行盤折合華一幣、較上週六市價漲二十六元六角、市氣銳利、可見一斑、但其影響申市、則因一般絲廠大多拋售過早、近月份及現貨絲不足應市、同時乾　　碼枯薄、價昂難得、致又形成原料缺乏之勢、故昨日申市極形紛亂、絲商討價、深高莫測、如白廠Ｂ字ＲＲ者、有持價在七百五十元、有均度者則均近八百元關、致洋莊絲銷堅而未暢、內外絲銷共售開四百二十包云、</p>
<h3>平水茶交易不寂</h3>
<p>昨據茶業公會報吿、綠茶市各路珍眉等交易仍淸、僅錦隆協和等對抽珍各有少數辦入、惟平水各茶、日來交易頗稱不寂、尤以普通　目價五十元左右者、成交見旺、前經恊和辦二千五百箱後、日昨怡和錦隆各進一千餘箱、及　隆對二三號珠茶熙春珍眉等亦均各有一千餘箱成交、查此項茶塲上存底已大减、觀市價較前　低二三元至五六元不等、但前途已呈穩定矣、</p>
<p>又據另一報吿云、昨日洋莊茶市、路莊珍眉綠茶、銷路略見活潑、英商怡和恊和等行、均因價格相宜、紛起動辦、全市成交四百餘箱、聞尚有零星額數、繼續談判、惟售盤縮至四十八九元、較前又跌二三元、此外針眉秀眉等貨、同孚錦隆等一行、亦有零星辦進云、</p>
<h3>油市　柏油浙路新貨將登</h3>
<p>柏油本已產新將近、今庚年令祗浙西嘉興帶最欠、與上年之十足豐收、適成一反比例、其餘如浙東之金蘭、鄂西之荊宜等處、均有七八成收成、若以全國平均計算、尚能稱賣年也、陳貨存底各處均厚、漠市之　枝津麻數在二三萬件而　地尙有未出運者、數亦不少、近悉漢市銷路不甚暢旺、無木重　每組在十八元四六角之間麻　油每擔十六元二四角、一旬前會有一度上漲、近又圓落矣、浙西柏子業已見樣、聞每擔在六元一二角、以此而合成本、則禾本油恐在二十元以外、陳禾本售過二十元五角、新貨申市迄今未有做開、大槪因年令關係、價格難康、致賣買未易接近、須待到新貨產後、始有交易、亦未可知也、</p>
<h3>五金　東白鐵提價後尚未開出</h3>
<p>東白鐵自議價提漲之後、客帮鉗路驟吿冷落、而廠家賣賣亦多觀望、以市情岑寂、執貨者因十底長期將到，均懷脫手主義、所以行情明硬暗一一軟、查昨市售價如三七尺每張估一元零三分、一（議價一元零五分）三六尺八角四分、（議價八角八分）均比議價跌落二分四分之多、查交易除零戶有點　外、大批生意仍無開出云、</p>

<h3>碩果僅存之卓特不羣的淋病療法</h3>
<p>— Dr.Tissot—Daguette著　日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳敏伯醫師譯</p>
<p>……意德兩國携手後醫界學對淋病臨床治療有更進一步合作之傾向　……自透膜殺菌療法之失敗以至蛋白體療法之成功慨先哲創業艱難　……淋病一入慢性必不免睪丸炎之併發因而滅種絕嗣並能危害生命</p>
<p>自從意國以其組合主義在全歐別樹一幟，而墨索里尼的法西斯政策爲舉世震驚以後，那以鐵腕政策稱雄于世界的希特勒主持下的德國，便和意國在全地面上卓立了他的超卓的地位。他們爲了政治氣味相投，他們是親密的携手了。</p>
<p>當德意携手後，醫學界便進一步合作起來。他們完全承認了淋病的一個共同療法，循着這個目標向前邁進，於是淋病的毒燄，從此大大地減低。自古至今爲淋病坑害了的人們，始獲着抬頭的一天，這不能不說是二十世紀人類所特有的幸福啊！</p>
<p>在這個爲醫界認爲共同的療法之前，先就有了淋病透膜殺菌療法。那療法從一方面講，固然並不錯誤，可是從多方面看起來，就不能夠成立。因爲在淋病初受傳染時，淋菌是沾附于尿道粘膜的，這時用透膜殺菌的療法，還有用處。但淋菌本極活躍，尿道被其侵入，沒有不隨卽竄入血液內的，所以治療儘管透膜殺菌，而事實上體內和血液中已有淋菌的分布，同時睪丸和攝護腺，甚至膀胱關節，都會發生炎症，睪丸腫硬了，若不治愈，便一輩不能生育。骨節痠痛，那就有成爲殘疾的淋病關節炎的可能。因此淋病無論初起慢性，惟一的根本辦法，就是撲滅全身的淋菌或毒素，而要達到這種目的，則只有去進服「克淋儂」一藥。因爲這是用蛋白體和黃色素合製成的藥劑。蛋白體有振奮全身抗淋素的能力，並增加白血球的數量，使發生偉大　菌之功力，這只有蛋白體有如效此用，而黃色素只不過利尿和消炎罷了。「克淋儂」的特點和特效也就在此，別的化學品以及拿其他的什麽成分混合黃色素來仿冒「克淋儂」其鄙俚與淺薄，眞是笑話極了。</p>
<p>據吾國淋病學家的臨床實騐，「克淋儂」爲治男女一切急慢白濁白帶之對症良藥，且毫無不良刺激。睪丸攝護腺炎症服之，可以照常生育。淋菌永遠根除！女子的白帶，最好同時外用「卡而雪地」爲坐藥，那末好得更快</p>
<h3>御妻新術談　難解決的男性苦問題</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>獻給青年維愛的新武器　獻給夫權旁落的懦男子</p>
<p>男性在現社會，他的責任，可說得非常重大而繁難，我們應該充實本身的力量，尤其是體力更爲重要。例如一個男子，他因爲身體虛弱，性機能的障礙，結果對於性的問題，就感到非常的苦悶了。因爲性機能的不健全，精神的困疲，性的不滿足，頭痛失眠，健忘心悸，貧血容顏的衰老，這都可說男性的致命傷。但更有較此還嚴重的。就是因性的不滿足，而惹起妻的厭惡，男子因自知本身有缺陷，所以不得不處處遇事委曲求全，不但使夫權旁落，且還要使妻子的驕縱，結果非離婚不可。這種苦悶，凡是每個患有性病的，都深深感到而體會得出的。此外又因了性的不健全，對於子嗣問題，也要發生困難的。那麼我們應該怎樣去挽救牠，衝破這道難關？則不得不妥爲全局治療了。</p>
<p>我們從千百例中的實際治騐，知道此種男性的性的不滿足，多數是由在青春發動期，施以手淫，性機能也就遭到大的打擊，把牠中途斵喪了。於是遺精滑精，和見色遺精，旣跟蹤而至，尤其是下部不能發育，最爲男性愛情之梗。法國摩羅Moe－au博士嘗說，對於此等不幸的一羣男子，必須根本徹底把青春腺矯正。而能担負得這副重任的，然據余經騐，以服神經衰弱特效藥「補體康」最爲適當，因爲此藥係用勇壯的動物荷爾蒙所製成。能旺盛性腺的內分泌，促使生殖機能的發育，並能根固青春腺的機能，一切性神經衰弱都可治愈了。至於如有遺精病的，可兼服「耐而斯遺精片」，以鎭固精關，連帶也可把牠根治了。同時男性的苦難問題，也給解決。「補體康」實是維愛的武器。</p>
<h3>關節炎治愈之又一例</h3>
<p>— 姚菊嚴醫師</p>
<p>患者趙駿文君，年二十七歲，在廿三歲時即罹淋病，雖不斷治療，而罕有成效可睹，且腿膝肩胛等關節，亦微感痛楚，如此症狀蓋已二年矣。且小便與房事時均感困難，有併發精系炎之趨勢。懇余醫治，診斷結果。發見關節炎腫，如蜂窠狀，且淋菌附緣其上者無可計數（見甲圖）乃用抗淋血清與電療外，一方進服「克淋儂」，連治五星期，炎腫全消，關節運動自如，關節之形狀，亦規復常態。淋菌絕跡，（如乙圖）。至今二年雖受劇烈刺戟，仍未復發。</p>
<h3>（甲圖）</h3>
<p>未服「克淋儂」前，關節紅腫，狀如蜂窠，淋菌附緣其間者無數</p>
<h3>（乙圖）</h3>
<p>經用「克淋儂」，炎腫卽完全消滅，淋菌亦絕跡。</p>
<h3>膣道病</h3>
<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>婦女通常最所常見之病狀，厥爲膣道糜爛，祭炎作痛。此病之由來，多起原於白帶，因患者，不論日夜，均有污垢之液體流出，其　粘膜因長期之浸潤而致糜爛也。因此最能將細菌帶入，誘發種種不測之危險。但許多婦女惑于成見，以爲白帶病勢最普通之症，多捨弃而不治。</p>
<p>患者不僅　道糜爛，且往往誘起月經不調，受孕力減退。其因淋毒而來之白帶者，則此白帶如沾染小兒之眼，每致目盲。惟一之標準療法，可用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥。以防腐消炎鎭痛止泌。如月經已不調者，可用「補女容」爲內服劑。因淋病者，可用「克淋儂」爲內服劑。內外兼顧，尤爲根本之療法。</p>

<p>（診所）四川路寗波路轉彎　（診時）：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>急性淋尿道炎之正規療法</p>
<p>急性淋之尿道炎，從前多用頓挫療法，或局部透膜殺菌療法，現已知此種療法之無用。因淋菌在急性淋時，雖在前尿道，但往往因手術或其他不正當之洗滌法時，此狡猾淋菌，卽乘機衝進後尿道，故雖能將前尿道之淋菌撲滅凈盡，結果因後尿道之淋菌，分頭奔竄，故炎症蔓延，變症百出，遂由急性淋變而爲慢性。復由慢性變而爲壞症。故此等症象，世界著名醫家，僉一致認當行正規療法，所謂正規療法者，卽內服德國「克淋儂」，同時輔用長短電波，以發揮「克淋儂」之抗淋殺菌之特殊功效。因此藥服後在短期內卽能發生抗淋毒素，　菌清濁之功。故不論淋菌奔竄何處，均可追殺而撲滅之。</p>
<p>余恒用此種正規療法，治愈淋病不知凡幾。有住河南路之周致果君，初患淋病因誤行不正規之治療，炎症更熾，大有波及後尿道之勢。旋因事至福州路大東書局購到拙著「性病全書」，知余頗善理此病，乃乞余治療，經用科學方法嚴密診斷結果，認周君之病，確已變成後尿道炎，故腫痛等勢，雖感略減，而淋菌實已深入內部矣。且排尿非常困難，時有膿血流出，乃用長短電波治療，一方用「克淋儂」以殺菌消炎利尿鎭痛，服至三星期，病灶已大爲縮小，故小便暢利，痛楚全愈。惟用顯鏡檢查，則尿液中尚有少許淋系殘遺，仍囑內服「克淋儂」至一星期，再行檢查，並無淋系，更用血清檢騐，亦無淋毒反應。遂確證其徹底根治，迄今六年，未有病的變動，且育一子亦三歲矣。</p>
<h3>腎病實騐錄</h3>
<p>— 前南洋醫科大學教授滬南平民醫院長鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>（診所）寗波路四川路口　（診時）下午四時至五時</p>
<p>（一）陰萎早洩獲得治愈</p>
<p>患者姜椿陶君，年卅六，天津人。原因—結婚已十五年，然迄今未曾生育。其夫人固體健無病，惟居恒抑鬱不樂，對姜君極爲冷淡。實由姜君患陰萎早洩所致。症狀—少年曾犯手淫，婚後房勞過度，遂漸勃起無力。且神經麻痹，毫無快感。馴至一觸卽洩，終於不舉。診療—患者荷爾蒙全然缺乏，神經失於濡養，亟投荷爾蒙製劑「補體康」內服，使荷爾蒙旺盛，一方施以電療，未及一月，卽奏良效，上月來信，謂彼已於中秋節邊，欣舉一雄云。</p>
<p>（二）遺精手淫生機回復</p>
<p>患者姚仲謙君，年二十一。商界。原因—十三歲時受劣友引誘，患手淫症。症狀—頭暈，失眠，健忘，每夜遺精，艷夢頻發，面部潮熱，身虧體憊。診療—先投服「耐而斯遺精片」治其遺精，並以「補體康」挽其衰弱，竟獲霍然。</p>
<h3>戒煙的必要信條</h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>……神經衰弱症爲戒煙所難免　……勉強戒煙有招發宿疾之虞</p>
<p>欲言戒煙，殊非易易。世之戒煙製劑雖多，然皆不外取其標而略其本，故雖能取效一時痛苦重重也。夷考其實，蓋由此等戒煙法，均不過專事清除煙毒，而忽視培補體力。或則由培補體力之名，而無其實，但旺盛體內之或種腺器耳。須知癖煙者，年深日久，則體中荷爾蒙，悉被毀滅，神經失於濡養，遂日呈衰弱，茍無煙毒之興奮，則呵欠連綿，遺精失眠等症，紛至沓來矣。故最新有效之戒煙法，以旺盛荷爾蒙爲惟一條件。此荷爾蒙劑「補體康」所以爲煙民一致賞用者焉。住小西門之紐慕廉君，吸煙十餘年，有陰萎靡早洩，遺精失眠諸症，欲戒煙則舊症復發，而平日吸食，非二錢不能足癮，經余用「補體康」囑服月許，煙毒解決，宿恙根除。且精神飽滿，面色紅潤，日臻強健云</p>
<h3>求姙術之新成功</h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>避孕術尚未成功　求孕術已得把握</p>
<p>世界上往往令人有所不平之事。例如子嗣，就是其中之一，有許多人，不要他生兒子，他偏偏生個不停，弄得子虛母弱，有許多人，雖千方百計求子，但依然達不到目的。這是何等不平的事啊！可是避姙術現在雖未成功，而求姙術則已有新的把握，已給萬能的科學發見了。曾在很多停孕婦女的例中，實地診察，知道凡是婦女不姙的原因，大多由於，卵巢機能失常，月經失調，小腹刺痛，白帶涓流，萎黃病，神經衰弱，心臟機能亢進，一切均失去正常形態。其不能受姙，也是理之當然。</p>
<p>我們要徹去治療此等失姙的障礙，不可不去調整此等失常的機能，如進服「補女容」，結果受姙者，計百分之九十四五，其餘五六人因另有其他原因中途停止受治。此爲科學受姙法之最新成功。德意志，意大利與蘇俄，因鼓勵生育，對於受姙藥，大爲風行。意俄兩國皆明令免稅進口，以利人民購服。惟有白帶者，宜外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥以滌白帶。更爲妥善。</p>
<h3>爲胃病患者進一言</h3>
<p>— 宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>胃腸消化不良之補救　久病胃呆者須兼滋補</p>
<p>人體司消化之器官，除口腔·唾腺·齒·食道而外，其主要者爲胃腸，蓋胃與腸，實亦連帶之臟器，胃臟健全，腸無有不健全，而胃臟呆滯，則腸蠕動機能亦必緩鈍，此胃病患者所以大便恒致秘結也。</p>
<p>胃病乃一慢性疾患，故氣人輙多貧血·消化不良·衰弱以及顔面蒼白等，故治療方面，非僅能以健胃粘膜之機能，調和腸部之蠕動，而供給豐富之營養也。查「強胃精」一藥，爲複方酵　劑，不特善治胃病之噯氣吞酸，嘈雜胸悶，嘔吐胃脹，心胃氣痛等症，尤善治大便秘結。而緩和腸蠕動亢進，故又能使下痢腹痛諸症，並獲全愈。且「強胃精」兼含維他命ABD，除有治愈因缺乏維他命B之腳氣症外，更能旺盛體力，補給全身之營養素，而恢復壯健，故茍能連續服用，可在極短時日內，可臻氣血充盈，</p>
<h3>遺精病之特殊治療</h3>
<p>— 武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>……遺精一次，等於流血一磅，　……挽救之方，必須根本兼顧！</p>
<p>遺精病，是一種隨文明發達而來的症狀，牠的領域，都市較鄉村流行爲大。膏粱子弟較窮苦的人容易犯之，但是大多數還是青年因犯手淫及婚後色慾過度而來的爲多，關於此種遺精病的治療，以服「耐而斯遺精片」一藥，功效最爲迅速。因此片有鎭靜虛性的神經興奮。而勃起神經與射精的中樞神經失常，也都可服「耐而斯遺精片」一藥以強固之。惟遺精久了，或由於發育不全和身體衰弱的醫家，不可不與「補體康」一藥同服，以強精補腦，促生新精的細胞。於是神經衰弱的症狀旣可除去，而遺精病更無形中治愈了。我自南通醫科大學畢業后，曾治一李姓青年，他因犯有自瀆病，所以在廿歲的時候已有遺精病，並有發育不全等病症乞我診治，乃用「耐而斯遺精片」與「補體康」同服，在三四星期中就治愈。而且身體很壯碩。儼然成一偉丈夫了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談談英王的風流艷史</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>婚姻問題，頗為複雜，不但一國有一國的婚姻制度，而一地方也有一地方的婚姻制度，有的是多妻主義，如中國古來是，有的是寡妻主義，如南洋某地有昆弟合娶一妻是，我國從前的婚姻，卽所謂專制婚姻，或是賣買婚姻賣買婚姻的惟一條件，便是『門當戶對』，換言之，卽門第之見是也，所謂門當戶對者何，如有錢者配有錢，有勢者配有勢，或有勢者配有錢，有錢者配有勢，亦可在門當戶對之例，現在婚姻自由，旣成法案，從前制度，完全打消矣。</p>
<p>近來英國大鬧其英王愛德華，與辛博生夫人戀愛一事，可知英國的門第觀念，或是階級觀念，非常之深，英國人素以『勤脫耳門』著稱者，其紳士式之風采，至今猶流傳勿替也，辛博生夫人，為一倫敦股票經紀人之妻，近日外傳已進行其離婚手續，將與英王以假期伴侶的資格，而預備進一步的工作，這樣一來，問題便發生了，以英國元首之尊，而欲娶一平民之女，不但是一個純潔女子，而且是一個有夫之婦，在英人目光中觀之，原是一件非常而了不得的事。</p>
<p>於是英王的戀愛問題，便成為一個極好談話的資料，據十七日倫敦電訊，英王愛德華，因英國政教雙方領袖，欲干涉其假期伴侶辛博生夫人，與彼此之友誼關系，曾大為震怒，據稱坎特布里大主教，與首相鮑爾溫，最近曾非正式赴白金漢宮進諫英王，乞其對于辛博生夫人之關係，稍之謹慎，英王以彼等干預彼之個人生活，憤怒異常，然猶不欲形之於色，故微顫其唇，而請主教與首相勿干他人之事而已，曰微顫其唇，曰不欲形之於色，這兩句十足表演英王雖幹了這一件桃色風流案，但是受一般輿論的刺戟，與政敎的干涉，亦無勇氣積極與之反抗也。</p>
<p>又據英倫電訊，英國人民，今日頗多想像英王愛德華八世，或將讓位其弟的克大公，而退為快樂之鄉間紳士，朝廷方面，雖稱讓位之說，完全無稽，然作此想像者，亦有種種根據云云，此種說數，明明是表示欲娶辛博生夫人，除非犧牲你的王位，而去做一鄉間紳士，則可，否則無論如何，對於辛博生夫入，應該斷絕關係，欲犧牲王位歟？還是要保持其愛情？二者英王當愼擇其一也，此種意思，雖未明言，而意則早在言外矣。</p>
<p>又據二十二日倫敦電，據接近英王旅行伴侶辛博生夫人者，今日宣稱，辛夫人實不願與英王愛德華結婚，以免英干為難，彼亦知國民空氣對此事之不佳矣，又據新聞紀事報，前日樣張，登載英十可與平民結婚之長新聞，謂法律准許英王選擇平民為后云云，但此項新聞旋卽刪去，可知以君主之尊，而不能要民間一女，甚矣門第之難除也如是。</p>
<h3>明園蔴菰種植塲參觀記</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>（本報特寫）新法種菰是我國最近發現一種新興事業，本市已經開始種植者有中美，大西，黃氏，明園等幾家，共中允以中美為最早，而此外私人的家庭蔴菰種植園也有好多個，但是因為出品還不很多，所以價格很昂貴，而且吃食者也祗限於西人，及高貴的酒席上才採用。</p>
<p>查種菰的事業，我國本是一向是有的，但是因為由於所用的是舊有土法，所以往往要受到天時地利上的限制，而且十種蔴菰祗可乾製，而新法蔴菰不但能够鮮售，其種植者獲利也頗豐厚·，因此，我覺得這也是一個値得提倡的副業。</p>
<p>我為了想要知道一點新法種菰的情形，和種植塲的佈置，於是便在昨天的下午，特地跑到束體育會路明園蔴菰種植塲里去實地參觀了一下。</p>
<p>（一）塲景一瞥塲作畏方形，約佔地十多畝，周圍建以籬笆。前面一埭平屋是包括辦事處，會客室，及工役職員食宿舍等，後面是一個很大的曠坪，那兒滿堆着一地的馬糞，幾個工人正在撥弄，傍邊有一泥堆，這些新泥好像是從別</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>地方運來的。中間一埭便是蔴菰種植室，左首有一座小屋子水汀爐子問，一隻儲水亭却就在爐子問的門口。</p>
<p>蔴菰室的構造是非常特別的，牆上只有一扇門，但終日緊閉着，除了有事情出入外，平常是絕對不許開啟的；牆壁的上端每距離二尺均有一個小圓開，下面離地一尺左右也有同樣的小窗洞，並且可以啟閉，以調節室里的溫度氣候，室中十分黑暗，並且有一種潮濕氣味充塞在里面；我由一位管理員照着電筒，走了進去。因為地上很濕，我就踏在一塊板上，向各處瞧了一回。看見四周都有水汀管子裝着，兩傍有兩隻木架，上面架着四隻長方形的木盤，大的每隻有八方尺。每隻盤里全平舖着一層新泥，泥面上有無數雪白的東西在透出來，那就是新出的蔴菰了。</p>
<p>這些蔴菰，有大的，也有像細珠一般小的，甚至有些還只能在泥面上看出一點白的痕跡。</p>
<p>（二）種植方法在各處參觀過了之後，我們便回到了會客室里；這時，那位管理員就把關於蔴菰種植的方法，和種子的來源吿訴了我們。</p>
<p>這種蔴菰子完全是向美國購來的，但美國有好多種，價格各有高低，良窳亦有分別。其購買是以袋計算的，袋之大小裝是以播種幾方尺面積為標準。其種子的樣子却彷彿似褐色的細灰，吹之拂之都能飛揚。至於種植的方法，則先將馬糞在太陽下用人工撥弄，至若干時日，其臭穢之氣已盡去，而沒有一點氣味了，並且所有的發熱性亦已完全消失，然後很勻正的舖在木盤里面，舖平後，就將等量的蔴菰種子拿來散播在馬糞面上，同時上面再鋪一層不薄也不厚的新泥。—這新泥，粘土砂種均不能用，必須要砂質壤十才相宜，</p>
<p>播種以後，室內的空氣便須關閉，不能通一點亮光，其溫度平均為七十度，並須每天潑水一决。的半月可見小蔴菇，但其生長繁植極速，故見小菌以後，三四天便可擇大割取，隨割隨去，不割則自然會枯萎。這樣每天的割，每天的出，多至四個月，少至三個月，便須重新再種。</p>
<p>（三）生產推銷其生產量，大的每方尺面積每天至多可產蔴菇一磅，照現時售價，値法幣一元，不過天暖時，繁殖較旺，冬天則未免稍遜。惟目前鮮蔴菰市塲上尙少看見，而且種植者不多，吃食的也很少，所以塲里的蔴菰除有各戶包定之每天若千磅外，均由塲中派員推銷。</p>
<p>鮮蔴菰不能見風見光，否則變色，故在泥上割下後，卽裝入盒內，而且它不能隔夜，否則其色就不十分潔白了。</p>
<p>此項鮮蔴菰味甚鮮美肥嫩，不但製餚極佳，且可以製為罐頭食品。故這種菰事業在歐美及日本各國都已十分發達，但是我國還是最近纔有人在提倡種植呢。</p>
<p>明園蔴菰種植為是去年創辦的，他們雖然過去曾經播過兩决種，但據說成績方面還不能與預算相近，這一决的結果如何，因為播種還不過一個多月，所以不能預約，然而比了前兩决成績是無論如何總要好點。</p>
<p>末了，我又問那位管理員，我們中國自己有沒有蔴菰種子？能不能也用改良方法種？以後，這改良蔴菰自己也可收籽麽？他說：我國亦有蔴菰種子，且也可用新法種植，但成績不很好：至於改良蔴菰收種籽，自己還不會。</p>
<h3>憑長媳婦</h3>
<p>— 士希</p>
<p>有一天，母親吿訴大家，說：楊海云已抱了一個十二歲的姑娘兒金枝來做媳婦了，對配他底四歲兒子火葱。他是我們四　家的佃戶，一家只有一個老婆和四歲的那兒子，每到時季他要忙着田裏事，也要忙着上山去做土（耙十）。因此他家那四歲的兒子便沒有人看顧，而且也沒有人替他們燒飯了。所以他抱那麽大的一個媳婦、也是為了這原因。</p>
<p>沒有好久，收租的時候到了，四嬸她們要去收租，，那天正遇着我的禮拜日，為要採栗子和柿子，就和她一道到楊海云家去。巳經快到十一點鐘了，他家裏還沒有人，只有那個十一二歲小媳婦和她那個四歲的小丈夫。</p>
<p>她是瘦瘦的身材，面孔很黑，紅一塊，黑一塊，說話聲音很小。牠底眼睛裏時常是潤濕的，雙手粗糙而且肥大。身上穿的是破洞爛眼的衣服·手膀·背上，胸膛都露在外面。</p>
<p>她告訴我們說：楊海云還沒有回來，便又背起她那小丈夫到廚房燒飯去了。</p>
<p>隔戶也是我們底佃戶，有大婦人家聽到我們說話聲，跑來請我們過去，倒了茶，又燒了幾個包谷給我們吃。四嬸順口問起了楊海云家的媳婦，那大婦人便連聲嘆氣道：</p>
<p>「罪孽的，老主家，你老人家沒有看見海云大娘是怎樣對待這個憑長媳婦？（童養媳）打死打活的，一天要燒三頓飯，水要自己挑，菜柴也要自己上山打，又要看家管孩子。有時，把飯燒遲了，海云大娘跨進門眼睛往廚房一看：飯沒有燒好，口裏就媽媽娘娘的駡起來，同時手中的木棍子也虎虎的打到她身上，差不多每天都是這樣的。……」</p>
<p>她話沒有說完，我們便聽見了在門外一種走動的聲音，那個憑長媳婦跨進門來了，說是楊海云已經回來了，請我們去吃飯。我們過去坐不久，又聽見嗚嗚咽咽的有人在哭着，問一下，才知道海云大娘又打起媳婦來了。</p>
<p>這個小媳婦身材雖然那麽短小而且瘦瘦的，却很會做事，每天除了燒飯看家管小丈夫，有時還要上山去做十，遇到收割的時候，海云大娘總要呌她做重事，有時要背紅少（山芋）從山上回家，約有八九十斤重的。剛把紅少倒了，又要背糞吿灰（尿和灰混合的肥料）上山。路走慢了，還要挨鋤頭打，海云自己雖也看不過去，可是他怕那婆子也就不敢說什麽話了。</p>
<p>有一天，那個憑長媳婦偸了空跑到隔壁楊子成家去對楊二嫂哭着訴苦，楊二嫂是一個直心腸人，便信口說：</p>
<p>「你這麼大就要一天挨兩頓打，還不如死了好。……」</p>
<p>她就把這話偸偸的在肚子裏記牢，回家來，打破了一隻碗，挨海云大娘一陣打，又得不到飯吃。等到晚上十二點的時候，她便偸偸的起來把藏在她床底下的雅片烟拿來混白酒吃了。到五點鐘她老婆婆喊她起來燒早飯，喊了好幾聲，不聽到她答應，她以為是她睡熟了，起來把被子拿開，在身上用力的打了她幾下，就自己賭氣到廚房發火去了。等到她把火發起了，還沒有看見她起來，她又去喊第二次，才知道她已吃烟而死了。</p>
<p>這是常我們第二次，到她家裏時去才聽說的。</p>
<h3>死（上）</h3>
<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>自己到底年輕，於「死」的觀念，是十分模糊的。明曉得人類大都有那末一天，但是總覺得「死」這件事，是非常遼遠和渺茫！</p>
<p>也曾在書本上，極力找尋過「死」的概念但是得到的，除了「灰色」和「黑色」以外就是「睡眠」一樣的安息了。</p>
<p>人類所以怕死，我以為並不在臨死時的痛苦：因為世間的確有不痛苦的死法，同時以死來解除痛苦），而在不甘寂寞，所以，卽使有人眞正感到浮世的辛苦，還不肯决然死去，一好死不如惡活」，這不是巳經成為格言了嗎？</p>

<p>舞聲社電遂劇</p>
<p>大中華（一一六〇）三時一刻至四時一刻奏曲（蘇音）　唱（曼娜）（　　）</p>
<p>阿Q</p>
<p>因為阿Q是是無產階級的代表人物，所以　終於不能不做個忠誠　勞働者，不能不做個徒具有人　性的孤獨者，甚至於不能不做個人間寃抑的無產者。又因為阿Q是無知識階級的代表人物，所以他以為作事與其「諱莫如深」，寗坦然把曾經做過偷盜的帮手吿人··戀愛與其與其手段誘惑而後得着女人之心，寗挺然長跪示伊以·月眞誠的赤心·在法庭對讞與其恃口强辯而希望悻免于禍·寗緘俯順好　就地而沒有作聲的羔羊。至於他由環境听獲得的待遇和結果—　—這便是有產與無產和有知識與無知識兩種階級的人們的差別點了。</p>
<p>阿Q，這個忠誠的勞動者始終是活現在群衆的耳中，他心目中以白食已力為榮，以勞　神聖自豪；他未嘗看重養尊處優的富人，未嘗因向己的低微的操　而自輕自賤，他是個抱有無　希望的樂大派的勞動者，然而，在他環境的人却都看小起他，譏笑他，奚落他。他由向外挑戰的反抗精神，退而為向內自制的無抵抗意志，他山「搶前使打」退而為「怒視衆人」，又退而為「强作自慰」更退而以「我是蟲豸」自承。但是阿Q畢竟不是提倡「無抵抗主義」的，他畢竟是無知識階級的工人，他為要滿足他的反抗精神的仲張，於是便把一肚皮的晦氣向那弱而無辜的小尼姑去發洩了。阿Q的這種態度，同時也就是一般有體面的權威者的態度。</p>
<p>阿Q不但是忠誠的勞働者，他也是一個具有「人類性」的獨身者，他不會忘了食，同時也就不會忘了色。他雖是沒有偌大手段和本領可去勾誘人家的少奶奶，沒有漂亮的容貌可去餌釣人家的姑娘，然而他對于那弱小可欺的小尼姑，起未免要飄飄然的，他對於那「同病相憐」的吳媽，又未免要搶前便跪了下去，希冀她也許會受感動的。然而畢竟是失敗了。吳媽哭了，要去自盡了，—這在吳媽的意思雖說不能不這樣敷衍一番，但阿Q的致命傷處，却便在乎這不能不敷衍。吳媽的不能不敷衍者，環境禮敎使之也;阿Q的所以受致命傷者，不曉得施用社交手段害之也。他的求愛手段除公然的「跪」及單純的「我和你睏覺」的要求以外，再沒有別的了。不但他的戀愛失敗，連他所用以自豪的謀生的勞工也落于小X之手了。</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Approves New Directives for Diplomacy with China; Instructions Given to Suma for Transmission to Kawagoe; Agreement Reached Between Army and Foreign Ministries; Established Policies Will Not Be Altered</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun and Kawagoe to Meet Again This Month</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning's cabinet meeting included a report from Foreign Minister Arita on the latest developments in Sino-Japanese negotiations and an explanation of future trends. He also presented new directives to Ambassador Kawagoe, which reportedly passed unanimously. After the cabinet meeting, Arita and Prime Minister Hirota held lengthy private discussions. The Army's views on Sino-Japanese negotiations were conveyed to Kuwashima Keiji, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, this morning by Isotani, Director of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau. A thorough study of the new directive's content was conducted at that time. Consul General Suma Tokuzo, stationed in Nanjing, was also present. It is reported that the Army and Foreign Ministries have reached an agreement. Suma is scheduled to leave Tokyo tonight with the new directives and return to his post tomorrow by ship from Kobe. Despite widespread rumors that the Foreign Ministry would issue a statement on the Nanjing negotiations, recent reports indicate that this will not occur tonight, at least. Army Minister Terauchi and Navy Minister Nagano have already left for Osaka, and Hirota is also scheduled to travel there tomorrow to attend the naval review. The cabinet meeting this Friday will be suspended once. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Senior officials from the Foreign and Army Ministries held an important meeting today to exchange views on Japan's future policy towards China. Participants included Major General Isotani, Director of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, Kuwashima Keiji, Director of the Foreign Ministry's East Asia Bureau, Uemura, Chief of the First Section, and Suma, the Japanese Consul General in Nanjing. After lengthy discussions, it was reported that all participants agreed to make every effort to make Chinese officials more aware that Japan's proposals for a peaceful resolution of Sino-Japanese differences were fair. It is generally believed that this step could eliminate possible misunderstandings and lead to a satisfactory outcome of the current Sino-Japanese negotiations at an early date. The officials also agreed to work to eliminate all factors that could lead to new unfortunate incidents between China and Japan. Regarding the issues of North China and joint anti-communism, Japan considers them to be the main foundation for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations and insists that they cannot be negotiated separately. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Suma quietly departed from here at 9:30 tonight for Kobe, and will embark on the Maya Maru for Shanghai tomorrow morning. Before his departure, when asked about the content of the new directives he was carrying to Ambassador Kawagoe, Suma declined to discuss the matter. However, well-informed diplomatic observers believe that Japan's established policies will not be altered. It is generally believed that the new directives reiterate the need to establish a fundamental adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations based on Japan's previously proposed demands. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The negotiations to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, including the six meetings between Zhang Qun and Kawagoe, have not yet reached agreement.

After these talks, Kawagoe will wait for Suma to arrive in Nanjing on the 30th to receive the Japanese government's new directives, and then schedule further meetings. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to several newspapers here today, the Foreign Ministry has agreed to slightly change Japan's attitude towards Sino-Japanese negotiations in order to resolve the disputes between the two countries. The Nichinichi Shimbun reports that after a meeting of Foreign Ministry leaders yesterday, it was decided that, for the time being, in addition to securing agreements on the broad outlines of Japan's demands regarding the North China issue and anti-communist cooperation, no further demands would be made on China regarding other matters. The Miyako Shimbun stated that this is the lifeline of Japan's proposals and that there can be no retreat under any circumstances, adding that China would now be made to understand Japan's readiness to overcome all obstacles concerning these two items, even if Japan had to sacrifice its secondary points after the Chinese government accepted these two items. The Nichinichi Shimbun also stated that after China accepts the broad outlines of the North China and anti-communist proposals, the specific agreement can be postponed until after satisfactory solutions have been negotiated for the many recent unfortunate anti-Japanese incidents. The newspaper also mentioned that diplomatic negotiations and non-diplomatic negotiations are progressing together. The newspaper concluded that the cabinet is expected to decide on a policy today based on the Foreign Ministry's resolution, expressing the belief that Sino-Japanese negotiations can achieve a satisfactory outcome through mutual concessions. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry and its related authorities held meetings on the 24th and 26th, focusing on Consul General Suma's report, to review the policy towards China. As a result, everyone agreed that there was no need to revise the established policy. It was then decided to convene a meeting of the Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministries on the 27th to report this matter and request approval. Foreign Minister Arita will then hand over the final directives to Consul General Suma. Consul General Suma will depart from Kobe on the Maya Maru on the 28th and return to Nanjing to convey them to Ambassador Kawagoe. The policy confirmed by the Foreign Ministry this time seems to be as follows: Sino-Japanese negotiations are still in progress, and Japan has not abandoned hope for diplomatic negotiations. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Vice Minister of the Navy Hasegawa departed from Tokyo Station at 9:30 pm on the 27th heading west, arriving in Kobe on the 28th.

The opinions of both sides have been unified. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>The Puppet Bandits in Chahar Change Their Plans to Invade Suiyuan; They Plan a Large-Scale Expansion Internally; Rumors of Dissolution Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>(Beijing) According to informed sources, the puppet bandit army in northern Chahar originally planned to launch attacks on eastern Suiyuan along several routes after this autumn.

They are actively working on replenishing weapons, cutting the weak and retaining the strong, recruiting soldiers or transferring additional troops.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Pays Attention to Domestic Newspapers</h3>
<p>Whether to Control News Reports is a Matter of Debate</p>
<p>Public Opinion Cannot be Ignored, Secret Policies Impede Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Amau, who strongly criticized Reuters on October 1 for publishing a report from its diplomatic correspondent in London about Japan's demands on China, has now turned his attention to domestic newspapers. Recently, Japanese newspapers have frequently published extremely provocative comments about the content of Japan's demands, without encountering any condemnation. Currently, in order to shield their neighbor's ears, Japanese authorities will correct the domestic opinion circles. This issue was raised by Suma, the Japanese Consul General in Nanjing, who recently returned to report on the progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations. Suma reportedly told the Japanese Foreign Ministry that "China is currently using the news published by Japanese newspapers to prolong the negotiations between the two countries, which is detrimental to Japan and must be carefully guarded against." For several days, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials have been debating whether to prohibit Japanese newspapers from disclosing Japan's demands on China. It is reported that Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe believes that the publication of such news is a major reason why Sino-Japanese negotiations are deadlocked. According to the Kokumin Shimbun, Foreign Minister Arita acknowledged that Suma's opinion was reasonable, but believed that the Foreign Ministry should not completely ignore the opinion of the people of the whole country. Another section of Foreign Ministry officials believed that the official's extremely secret policies would impede progress in the negotiations, because if the newspapers had no reliable information, they would all make unfounded speculations. According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Arita will soon make an unofficial announcement of Japan's policy on future negotiations between the two countries as a concession to this view.

<h3>Tianjin's Yarn Industry Improves</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin's yarn industry has improved. A bale of coarse yarn can be sold for a net profit of 30 yuan. Beiyang Textile Mill has increased production to 180 bales of yarn per day, and Hengyuan Textile Mill has also increased production to 160 bales. Both are sold out on the same day. This has not happened in ten years. According to Lu Chongzhi, the manager of Hengyuan and Beiyang, the improvement in the yarn industry reflects the stability of the rural areas in North China, the bumper harvest this year, and the increase in purchasing power. Furthermore, due to national unification, political obstacles have been removed. Hengyuan and Beiyang expect to make a profit of hundreds of thousands of yuan in their year-end budget and have decided to increase the number of spindles and expand their operations. The Japanese-owned Gongda and Liuda textile mills and the Huaxin and Baocheng textile mills are also actively preparing to resume production due to the good yarn market. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Meteorological Observatory Explains Reasons for Lack of Rain</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) This autumn, the drought south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River has been unusually severe. The reason for this is the abnormal weather. According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, the period of prevailing winter monsoons arrived earlier this year, and the continental high pressure is unusually developed, with no storms. In September, no storms passed along the Yangtze River between 28 and 32 degrees north latitude. Since October, no storms have passed south of 40 degrees north latitude. September is originally the month when typhoons prevail, but because the continental high pressure is strong, typhoons have moved away, and rainfall has disappeared. As a result, the number of sunny days in various places has increased, the temperature has risen, and rainfall has greatly decreased. According to reports from various places along the Yangtze River in September, the rainfall in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River was lower than the average, and there was no major drought in the lower reaches. Since October, there has not been a single drizzle in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. However, judging from the current pressure distribution situation, the high pressure remains in central China and is very stable. It is unlikely that there will be rainfall in the next day or two.

<h3>This Week</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Beiping</p>
<p>—Changes in Personnel of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council—</p>
<p>General observations: The Japanese side's pressure on the Hebei-Chahar authorities has seemingly eased recently compared to before. However, under the threat of their large garrison, their long-advocated "economic cooperation" and various other piecemeal demands have not been paused slightly and are urgently seeking to be put into practice first. However, the current difficulty in implementing them is the issue of selecting responsible individuals. Therefore, partial changes and supplements to the Hebei-Chahar political authorities are inevitable. The following is a record of the personnel involved:</p>
<p>Li Sihao: Negotiations for Li's appointment as Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council were underway even before Wang Kemin. Wang could not take office due to numerous obstacles, so Li was invited to take the position, thus reviving his career. Li finally flew from Shanghai to Beiping on the 10th of this month. By then, negotiations had matured, so all relevant parties were unwilling to express their opinions. Some even thought Li's visit north was to inspect the business of the Da Zhong Bank, which he had been operating, and that he would soon return to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the situation took a sudden turn, and Li's appointment as Chairman of the Economic Committee was officially announced and scheduled to take office within two or three days. On the morning of the 15th, he formally took office at the council. On the afternoon of the 18th, he went to Tianjin, staying there for two days. During this time, he held separate discussions with Tashiro, senior staff of the Japanese garrison, and Horiuchi Kanjo, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin. Li held important financial positions in the Beiyang government era. In the 13th year of the Republic (1924), when Duan Qirui was in power, Li was a key figure in the controversial Nishihara Loans. Until recently, he still held considerable influence in finance and was an old friend of Tashiro and Horiuchi of the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Lu Zongyu: Held several prominent positions in the Beiyang government era. In the 8th year of the Republic (1919), the "May Fourth" Movement was triggered by his negotiations with Japan. Lu, along with Cao Rulin and Zhang Zongxiang, was criticized by the Chinese people. In recent years, he has been living in seclusion in Tianjin. Since the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, there have been several rumors of him taking up a certain position, but these have never materialized. In recent years, Lu has repeatedly voiced his grievances, believing that foreigners misunderstood him regarding the events of the 8th year of the Republic, leaving him unable to defend himself. Therefore, his current emergence may be a rare opportunity to make amends. Various parties here are paying close attention to Lu's future actions.</p>
<p>Qi Xieyuan: Qi went into seclusion in Tianjin after stepping down as Military Governor of Jiangsu. Since the North China Incident occurred last July, Qi has been one of the many retired officials active in Tianjin. After the Hebei-Chahar Political Council appointed Qi as a member, the relationship between Qi and the Hebei-Chahar authorities slightly changed. The original plan for this personnel change in the Hebei-Chahar situation was to establish a standing committee of five members in the political council, with Qi, Jia Deyao, Cao Rulin, Qin Dechun, and Zhang Zizhong serving as members. Later, Cao expressed his unwillingness to take office, so the plan was changed, with Qi, Jia, and Qin serving as "Standing Committee Members Attending Office Regularly" to assist Song in handling everything.</p>
<p>Shi Yousan: Shi Yousan and Song Zheyuan and other figures from the 19th Route Army were originally comrades in the former Northwest Army. Later, as the situation changed, they each pursued their own paths, with Shi's changes being particularly numerous. During the Tianjin Incident in the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and the Bai Jianwu rebellion in Fengtai last year, people blamed Shi. In fact, Shi's activities have not stopped since the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident). The arrest warrant had long been posted at the national borders. This spring, the Hebei-Chahar authorities, in view of various circumstances and facts, simultaneously revoked the arrest warrants for Shi, Hao Peng, and Bai Jianwu. After that, the relationship between Shi and the Hebei-Chahar authorities underwent a major change. Until recently, there have been many rumors in society about Shi, Qi Xieyuan, and others being active in Tianjin. Therefore, on the 18th of this month, the authorities here announced that Shi was appointed as the Commander of the Hebei Northern Border Area Security, although the area under his jurisdiction is not large, it also expresses the authorities' intention to rely on him. Whether the reputation of Shi, Qi, and others can be salvaged by this opportunity will depend on their future actions.</p>
<p>Zhang Shizhao: Zhang held important positions such as Minister of Education in the Beiyang government era. When the issue of the Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Economic Committee was shelved after Wang Kemin, Li Sihao, Zhang Hu, and others were considered, there was talk of inviting Zhang to take the position. Now that the position of Chairman of the Economic Committee has been filled by Li Sihao, Zhang has also taken office as a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and has further succeeded Deng Zhexi as Chairman of the Legal System Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council.</p>

<h3>Reassessing British Far East Policy</h3>
<p>— Fortunately</p>
<p>In the current state of China's foreign relations, Britain exerts a significant influence. Britain's policy of protecting Far Eastern markets, and indeed all its economic and political activities on the world stage, seem to be closely related to China's destiny.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the keynote of British Far East policy had already seen some significant manifestations during Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's visit to China last year. After he returned to London, Britain became even more active in the Far East. Leaving aside Britain's investment activities in the Yangtze River and South China over the years, let's just talk about the events of the past few months. Rogers, the famous British monetary expert who accompanied Leith-Ross to China last year, has returned to China, reportedly to continue Sir Ross's mission. Recently, the British Export Credits Guarantee Department dispatched Conservative MP Mr. Patrick as the department's representative in China. We can understand the significance of this matter at a glance. As for the rumored £10 million loan, no matter how it is implemented in the future, it can at least further promote Sino-British economic relations. In addition, Lord Rothermere, the giant of the British press, traveled to the Far East earlier this month and strongly advocated in telegrams back to Britain that Britain should rapidly increase assistance to Far Eastern trade and shipping. Judging from the attitude of the British government and public towards Far Eastern issues, we feel that Britain's current self-defense for its own interests indeed has a fairly consistent relationship of interests with our self-defense for national survival. The evolution of its Far East policy is something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Looking at the historical process, Britain once dominated the Chinese market. However, since the European War, it has suffered a series of severe blows. The termination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was clearly due to its own deep awareness that raising a tumor leaves trouble behind. Since the September 18th Incident, not only has its interests in China been shaken, but even the British territories in India, Australia, and the Nanyang region have become targets of the Far Eastern island nation. This seems to have been unexpected by the British. Britain today cannot be without the intention of mending the fold after losing the sheep.</p>
<p>Although Britain has long had the emblem of a nine-tailed fox on the world diplomatic stage, after Ross stumbled several times and was given the cold shoulder, it first signed a naval agreement with the Soviet Union, and then implemented currency cooperation with France and the United States. It is clearly seeking to defend and attack in the Far Eastern market. From Britain's standpoint, this "defense as offense" strategy is for temporary security. From Japan's point of view, it has become a major obstacle that it yearns to break through.</p>
<p>The position our country is currently in is crystal clear. We should recognize the keynote of British Far East policy and determine an appropriate diplomatic path. Only in this way can we prevent the disruption of peace in the Far East and save our national crisis.</p>

The content is divided into five items: (1) Accelerate the manufacture of aircraft, the number of which should be more than the original plan of 1,000 aircraft, and their power should be greater than the original plan; (2) Add aircraft fields and expand the existing aircraft fields; (3) Increase gasoline storage and improve the armament equipped for each aircraft; (4) Increase the number of air force personnel; (5) National aircraft manufacturing experimental sites should be concentrated near Chalon in the Provence region in the south. The cabinet then discussed the budget for 1937 and unanimously approved the report submitted by Finance Minister Auriol. According to the plan set by the Minister of Finance, the business tax rate should be reduced, and the tax rate should be increased for those with an annual income of more than 60,000 francs. The cabinet also decided to hold a state council meeting at 5 pm to discuss the diplomatic situation and determine the date for the resumption of Congress, which is expected to be November 3 or November 5.

<p>(London) It was learned here today that the Soviet Union is currently formulating an air force plan based on the standards of the two countries. Once this plan is completed, the Soviet air force will be sufficient to cope with Japan and Germany simultaneously. The Soviet Union's sudden expansion of its air force is due to Germany's emphasis on setting up defenses in the Rhineland, which hinders French troops from assisting Russia, thus weakening Russia's military position and promoting the fascist bloc in Europe. (National, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Since Germany and Italy jointly established a common anti-communist front, expressing their intention to overthrow communism, the left-wing camp on the European continent will soon fall. It is reported that the Soviet government, from the perspective of salvaging the general situation, has established a two-country standard plan for the air force, and has decided to move towards the realization of the air force advantages of Germany and Japan. As for the Soviet government's attempt to implement the two-country standard plan, the following are listed:</p>
<p>(1) Since Germany decided to implement the re-equipment of the Rhineland, the Soviet government has difficulty expecting the assistance of the French National Army;</p>
<p>(1) Since the European dictatorship group has strengthened, the hostile forces against the Soviet Union have become more powerful;</p>
<p>(1) The British government seems to be attempting to get closer to the German government;</p>
<p>(1) Since the Belgian government declared neutrality, the position of the French army has been weakened. (Allied, 26th)</p>
<p>Honolulu Forty US Navy aircraft, led by Admiral King, flew from Pearl Harbor Naval Base into the central Pacific today in the rain to conduct unprecedented solo maneuvers. Admiral King kept the details of the exercise secret, only saying that the exercise site was a large triangle between Honolulu, Midway Island, and Palmyra Island.

<h3>Aviation Race Between Paris and Saigon; Two Aircraft Withdraw Mid-way; Only One Aircraft Remains En Route</h3>
<p>(Paris) In the aviation race from Paris to Saigon, 14,000 miles, only one of the three participating aircraft, piloted by Charles and Biel, remains en route. The aircraft piloted by Arnoux and Yopi withdrew from the race yesterday when it landed in Karachi due to damage to the fuselage. The aircraft piloted by Testroja and Darman was forced to land in Kaurinz yesterday due to lack of fuel. After refueling, it continued to move forward. It arrived safely in Baghdad at 12:46 pm yesterday, and then departed again after forty minutes. After not hearing any news of the aircraft for 24 hours, Teste suddenly sent a telegram from Bushire saying that he and his companion had decided to abandon the race and are now returning home via Damascus. The reason for the abandonment was not stated. The aircraft piloted by Charles and Biel encountered danger in Lyon yesterday due to engine damage, but their ambition was not discouraged. This morning, they returned to the Le Bourget airfield. Because the radio operator was sick, they replaced him with another person and set off again at 10:31 am. Before leaving, they said that although they lost two days of time, they still hoped to break the record (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Russian Naval Agreement; Britain Makes Concessions to Russia; Germany Expresses Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the naval agreement recently negotiated between the British government and the Soviet Union, it is rumored that Britain has made many concessions. Labrouye, the naval reporter for Le Petit Parisien, recently declared that Germany has notified Britain that the points that Britain intends to concede are said to conflict with the London Naval Treaty of the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States (signed in March 1936) and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement (signed in June 1935). If this is true, Germany will declare the Anglo-German Naval Agreement terminated. The reporter also said that the main clauses contained in the new London Naval Treaty of Britain, France, and the United States include two types. One is that the signatory countries should notify each other of the warship construction procedures. The second is that each item has quality restriction measures, but this clause cannot take effect unless all naval countries participate unanimously. After the establishment of the new naval treaty, the reason why Britain contacted Germany and the Soviet Union separately was because of this. Later, when Germany and Britain conducted negotiations, Germany agreed to accept this clause, but raised several reservations regarding the Soviet Navy, especially the Soviet Far East Fleet, believing that the armaments equipped by Soviet warships were newer than the most advanced warships in Western European countries and that it possessed the world's most powerful submarine fleet, with a total of 120 large submarines and 20 more under construction. In addition, the Soviet Union argued that it had the right to build seven Class A cruisers (10,000 tons displacement), all equipped with 180mm caliber guns (because Russian technicians are accustomed to working with this caliber). All of this is not allowed by the qualitative restriction measures of the new naval treaty (this measure prohibits the construction of cruisers over 8,000 tons and does not allow the equipment of guns with a caliber of more than 155mm). Germany has not approved it, and the Soviet Union is allowed to monopolize its advantages. In addition, the Soviet Union used Japan's failure to participate in the new naval treaty as an excuse to claim that it had the right to build warships freely in the Far East. In this way, it is not difficult for the country to expand its Far East fleet and transfer the newly built ships to the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea at any time. In Germany, according to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, its total fleet tonnage should be limited to 35% of the total tonnage of the British Navy, which is naturally behind the Soviet fleet. Regarding the tonnage figures of the Soviet submarine fleet, the naval reporter for Le Petit Parisien believes that Germany is exaggerating. Although the three Soviet battleships have recently been renovated and equipped with new armaments, this is no different from what other countries have done to refit old battleships, and there is no need to pay special attention to it.

<h3>A Page in the British King's Love History Over the Past Two Years; Daily Gifts of Fresh Flowers to His Girlfriend; Mrs. Simpson Granted Divorce from Her Husband</h3>
<p>(London) It was learned here today that King Edward has been sending his girlfriend, Mrs. Simpson, roses worth £5 every day for the past two years. (National, 26th)</p>
<p>Ipswich The divorce case between Mrs. Simpson, a friend of King Edward, and her husband was heard in court here today and was granted a divorce in just ten minutes. According to the grounds for divorce filed by Mrs. Simpson, her husband was unfaithful, and two waiters testified as witnesses, but who her husband had an affair with was not disclosed. (National, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned here today that the Archbishop of Canterbury has decided to decline to preside over the King's coronation ceremony next year because the public may misunderstand that the bishop has ignored the relationship between King Edward and Mrs. Simpson. This decision is said to be of a "personal" nature, because the bishop is the religious advisor to Queen Mary and the leader of the Church of England, which is different from the position of the Archbishop of York. If the Archbishop of Canterbury insists on this, then Edward's coronation ceremony next year may be presided over by the Archbishop of York. However, if this happens, it will attract worldwide attention. (National, 26th)</p>
<h3>A Team of British Sailors Insulted by Japanese Police in Taiwan; British Fleet Commander Postpones Trip to Japan</h3>
<p>(London) It is learned that the commander-in-chief of the British fleet stationed in China, Vice Admiral Little, has postponed his trip to Japan. The reason is currently being investigated locally. The Admiralty heard news that an unfortunate incident between Britain and Japan had occurred again in Keelung, Taiwan, and telegraphed to inquire about the truth. The simple reply was that a small team of sailors from the British submarine supply ship Medway, 15,000 tons, had landed in Keelung to relax and were suspected by Japanese police of taking pictures of a fortified area. They were all taken to the police station for questioning. It is said that before being released, they were treated rudely. After the search, it was found that the suspicion was completely unfounded. However, the British authorities have not received a written explanation or apology from the Japanese side. This matter has been negotiated with the Japanese government through diplomatic channels. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) A well-informed source here recently declared that the British fleet in the Far East was originally scheduled to visit Japan this year, but Fleet Commander Little has postponed the date of the visit. The reason should be sought in this matter. Officials said that the British government had reason to lodge a formal protest. The postponement of the Far East fleet's visit to Japan shows the seriousness of the case. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<h3>Belgian Party Strife; Socialist Party Demands the Suppression of Fascism</h3>
<p>Brussels The Socialist Party Congress continued yesterday and passed a resolution stating that because domestic groups that endanger national security are supported by foreign countries, the party specifically requests the government to take strict measures immediately to stop them. The Socialist Party has always accused the fascist Rexist Party of accepting German money, but has not presented any evidence to substantiate its claim. The resolution passed this time seems to be aimed at the Rexist Party. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Brussels During the demonstration held by the fascist Rexist Party the day before yesterday, leader Degrelle was arrested by the police and was not released until yesterday morning. Degrelle then gave a speech to 600 party members in the evening, saying, "The demonstration the day before yesterday was a great success. The outside world said that there were only 5,000 people participating, but there were actually 50,000. I will ask the government to allow the party to hold another rally. At that time, the number of participants can reach 400,000. From this, it will not be difficult to recruit the people of the whole country." He then reported on his arrest, saying that he had stayed in a house on Saint Gudule Square on Saturday and Sunday in order to avoid the eyes and ears of the government and did not go out, hoping to give a speech to the crowd the next day, but he was still arrested by the police. Degrelle now plans to go to various provinces to continue his propaganda movement, but the detailed plan has not been announced. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<h3>Failure of the Spanish Government Army's Final Counteroffensive; Rebels Were Once on the Verge of Collapse; Airstrikes Were Instrumental in Turning the Tide</h3>
<p>Talavera: Government militias launched a fierce counteroffensive 18 miles southwest of Madrid against Navalcarnero. After a day of fierce fighting, the Nationalist forces repelled the militias. During the battle, for two hours, the defending forces seemed on the verge of collapse. The militias began their offensive at dawn with heavy artillery bombardment, one force advancing from the north and another from the south, attempting to encircle the town. Nationalist commander Colonel Asensio could only respond to the frontal assault with a few mortars and machine guns, unable to attend to the flanks. The situation was dire. Fortunately, the air force responded to the call and strafed the militias with bombs and machine-gun fire, averting disaster. Simultaneously, the government's encircling column was about to converge on the highway to Valmojado behind Navalcarnero. Then, a detachment of Moroccan and foreign legion troops arrived at the rear, and with the aid of aircraft, defeated the besieging militias. It is now believed that this was the government army's final counteroffensive. According to several military observers, the Madrid garrison is exhausted, and the city may fall within a week. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Madrid: A special dispatch from our correspondent reports that government forces launched an offensive against the Nationalist forces near the city of Navalagamella, southwest of the capital, yesterday and have achieved victory, advancing to within four kilometers of the city's outskirts. Their left flank, under the cover of light tanks and field guns, even advanced to within 200 meters of the city walls. Many of the shells hit their mark, setting many houses in the city on fire. The government army headquarters has now ordered a temporary halt to the advance to avoid being exploited by the Nationalist forces, resulting in the undoing of previous gains. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Saint-Jean-de-Luz: Basque militias attacked Nationalist revolutionary army positions in Mañaria, 20 miles east of Bilbao, today, but were repulsed, suffering over 200 casualties.

<p>Talavera: According to a Nationalist forces press officer, the ring around Madrid is tightening. Nationalist forces have occupied Guadarrama, a town on the Madrid-Sigüenza highway, bringing the eastern Nationalist forces front to within 35 miles of the city. Nationalist aircraft bombed Madrid's barracks and railways again today, and destroyed the civilian airfield in Barajas. For the first time since the outbreak of the civil war, Madrid's shortwave radio station did not broadcast any news last night. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

The rebels have not advanced in recent days, so the cabinet hopes to build defensive fortifications outside the city. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>Russian and Italian Arms Supplies to Spain</h3>
<p>(London) The Daily Express recently published a front-page headline with news from their correspondent in Istanbul, Turkey, stating that last week, 23 Soviet ships passed through the Dardanelles Strait, bound for the Mediterranean, 15 of which were carrying munitions openly to Spain. For example, the "Garl Libin" carried two aircraft and 500 tons of military equipment to Cartagena, Spain; the "Terens Balter" carried six aircraft, 70 trucks, 1,500 tons of ammunition, and 2,000 tons of food and medical supplies to Barcelona; and the "Shakto" carried a batch of military equipment to Alicante. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Rumors that the Soviet freighters "Volga," "Siberia," and "Leningrad" had transported munitions through the Dardanelles Strait to Barcelona, Spain, have been vehemently denied by the Soviet Embassy in the UK. It is claimed that the "Volga" is currently undergoing repairs in Dover, England; the "Siberia" departed London on the 17th of this month and has already arrived in Leningrad, loading cargo; and the "Leningrad" was built in 1889, is very old, and can only sail along the Black Sea coast, never having sailed outside the Black Sea. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey: Rumors that several Soviet warships had recently passed through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits into the Mediterranean have been denied by Turkish officials. They stated that if Soviet warships were to enter the Mediterranean from the Black Sea, they would have to obtain permission from the Turkish government before passing through the straits, according to the new Straits Convention established at the Montreux Conference in July. However, the Soviet Union has not recently submitted such a request to Turkey, indicating that the claim of their warships passing through the straits is inaccurate. However, it is true that several Soviet freighters have passed through the straits into the Mediterranean. Some of their cargo was grain, and the contents of others are unknown. Furthermore, these freighters claimed to be sailing to Mexico, but after 12 to 15 days, they returned to the Black Sea, indicating that their voyage did not extend beyond the Mediterranean.

<h3>Six Governments Exist Within Spain; Portugal Recognizes Rebel Government</h3>
<p>(London) There are now six governments in Spain. According to a Paris dispatch, the militias stationed in Bujaraloz, 37 miles southeast of Zaragoza, declared the autonomy of Aragon today and have established a provisional government. However, the old capital of the state, Zaragoza, remains in the hands of the Nationalist revolutionary army.

<p>Lisbon: An official statement was issued here today, explaining the reasons for Portugal's severing of diplomatic relations with Spain, and publishing the full text of the note from the Portuguese government to the Spanish ambassador in Lisbon. The note is divided into six sections. The first section states that the Madrid government sent a note to Portugal on September 15th, accusing it of aiding the rebels, but without providing any supporting documentation. The Madrid side reported this matter to the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee and the League of Nations without waiting for a response from the Portuguese government. The second section states that the Portuguese chargé d'affaires protested to the Spanish government, saying that it had privately inspected Portuguese diplomatic documents. However, according to the Spanish government's reply, future diplomatic correspondence would not be guaranteed. The third section criticizes Spain for searching Portuguese diplomatic pouches containing diplomatic documents. The fourth section mentions that authorities in Tarragona displayed hostility when Portuguese ships transported Spanish refugees back to their country. The fifth section states that the Spanish ambassador in Lisbon fabricated rumors that he had been isolated within the embassy, as if under house arrest. The main point of the sixth section is that, in view of the above facts, it is impossible for Portugal to maintain amicable relations with the Madrid government. The Portuguese chargé d'affaires in Spain has received instructions to leave Spanish territory immediately. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Romanian King Visits Czechoslovakia Accompanied by Crown Prince and Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: King Carol II, accompanied by Crown Prince Michael and Foreign Minister Antonescu, departed for Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, yesterday to attend the country's National Day celebration. The local newspaper "River Te Weir Lur" recently published speeches by King Carol, former Foreign Minister Titulescu, Czech President Beneš, and Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, all emphasizing the vitality of the Little Entente. King Carol said, "The most pleasing thing about this trip is the clear demonstration of the unity and indivisibility of the Little Entente countries." Czech President Beneš said, "The political organization established by the Little Entente countries originates from an idea: that we can work and help each other with confidence and possess great power, willing to participate in European politics with full rights." Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović declared, "The basic principles of the South's foreign policy remain two: maintaining the most friendly relations with allied countries, and maintaining normal relations with neighboring countries." Former Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu said that the achievements of the Little Entente demonstrated the great effectiveness of establishing regional self-defense based on the principle of mutual assistance and within the framework of the League of Nations.

Political circles here are very pleased with this news and believe that the guarantee previously made by the Spanish Nationalist forces government that it would not cede the Balearic Islands to Italy or the Canary Islands to Germany is now credible after the publication of the Schongau communiqué. Political circles also stated that Italy and Germany have not reached a consensus on how to respond to the Soviet Union's stance on the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. Germany advocates adopting a peaceful approach to maintain the existence of the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to the UK Begins His Term by Focusing on Anti-Communism; Advocates Cooperation Between the Two Countries</h3>

<p>(London) After the arrival of the new German Ambassador Ribbentrop, many newspapers extended a welcome, saying that there was hope for an improvement in relations between Britain and Germany. However, the Daily Telegraph, a Conservative newspaper, and the News Chronicle, a Liberal newspaper, both expressed surprise at Ribbentrop's statement to the press yesterday that communism was a real threat to peace in Europe. The Daily Telegraph wrote, "It is regrettable that Ambassador Ribbentrop, at the beginning of his term, spoke of the dangers of communism and called for close cooperation between Britain and Germany, because there are even more compelling reasons why Britain and Germany should reach an understanding." The News Chronicle wrote, "If Ambassador Ribbentrop wants to promote a good understanding between Britain and Germany, he needs to find another way, and not rashly embark on a crusade against Russia."

<h3>US Election Campaign Intensifies; Landon Spares No Effort in Attacking Roosevelt; Accuses Him of Abusing Public Funds and Destroying People's Freedom</h3>
<p>(New York) The current election campaign between President Roosevelt and Landon has reached its crucial stage. Roosevelt is currently in his White House office, busy drafting his final speeches, preparing to deliver them in Pennsylvania, New York, and neighboring states. Landon, meanwhile, is engaged in a speaking tour from the West Coast to the East Coast, having passed through Washington on his way to New York. He will make brief stops in various important cities along the way. President Roosevelt will depart from Washington tomorrow evening on his special train, intending to deliver speeches in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. Roosevelt will begin his final campaign speeches at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. A grand occasion is planned for October 31st at Madison Square Garden in New York. On the eve of the election, Roosevelt is expected to use radio broadcasts to make a final appeal for votes to the national public. At the same time, Landon, after a brief rest in California, will continue his eastward journey by train, making travel speeches. However, because his throat ailment has not fully recovered, a doctor is constantly attending him. Landon is scheduled to give an important speech in Philadelphia tonight and plans to deliver his final political views to the citizens of New York at Madison Square Garden on October 28th. Landon also intends to broadcast his speech on the radio on the eve of the election. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA: Republican presidential candidate Landon said in a speech here today that President Roosevelt was openly wasting the people's money, violating the Constitution to oppress voters, and infringing on the privileges of the states, destroying individual freedom, and making the country a dictatorship with power concentrated in the President alone. The purpose of the Republican platform is to protect the Constitution and the lives of the American people, in order to prevent the New Deal from building an autocratic centralized government system. Landon also promised that if he were to take office, he would stop using the people's money for political activities and restore the position of the Budget Bureau, making it free from White House control, because the government should know that even a country as wealthy as the United States can be impoverished. Landon also said that people in Pennsylvania receiving government relief had received warnings that they would lose their relief funds if they did not re-elect President Roosevelt. Therefore, the weapons used by the current government are no different from the dictatorial governments in European countries that destroy people's freedom. The current government has seized the privilege of the House of Representatives to propose tax bills and the control of Congress over expenditures. People should know that the waste of the New Deal will ultimately be borne by the people. (National News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>Cotton and Wheat: New York Cotton Market: The opening price was slightly mixed today, with prices falling by 1 to 6 pound sterling compared to yesterday's closing price.

<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in North China Conduct Exercises: Sounds of Gunfire Heard Within Beijing on the 26th, Tensions Rise in Fengtai and Lugouqiao in the Western Suburbs</h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: Following the increase of Japanese troops stationed in North China, their first major exercise commenced on the 26th. This day involved separate exercises by each regiment. The Tianjin contingent exercised in the vicinity of Tianjin, while the Beijing contingent exercised near Beijing. The Hebei-Chahar Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Foreign Affairs Committee, and the 29th Army Military Department all dispatched liaison officers to collaborate with the local police stations in the exercise areas, responsible for providing assistance. Matters such as the Japanese troops' encampment locations and the procurement of fodder, food, and other supplies were all handled by the liaison officers. The Japanese troops participating in the exercise began moving and concentrating separately from the 25th, using special trains provided by the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway for transportation. It is reported that one train of soldiers arrived in Tianjin from Shanhaiguan that day, and two trains arrived in Fengtai from Tianjin on the morning of the 26th. At 3:00 PM, one train departed from Fengtai for Tongzhou. It is scheduled that two trains will depart from Beijing via Dongbianmen on the 27th, and one train will arrive in Beijing from Tianjin. On the 28th, it is scheduled that two trains will depart from Tongzhou for Fengtai. In the Beijing area, the locations traversed by the Japanese troops' exercise were the eastern, southern, and western suburbs, as well as Lugouqiao, which belongs to Wanping, and Dahongmen, which belongs to Daxing. The situation on the 26th is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to the exercise schedule, a regimental exercise will be held in Shubao (20 li from Shuzhimen) in the eastern suburbs on the 27th. Our side has already selected encampment locations in advance at locations such as Princess Tomb, Yongjia Tomb, South Shijia Tomb, Songjia Tomb, and the Three Saints Temple. The Japanese troops will set up tents and not borrow civilian housing. On the morning of the 26th, more than 50 Japanese troops stationed in Beijing had already gone to these locations to prepare everything and camped there that night. The Japanese troops who arrived in Fengtai on the morning of the 26th and a portion of the Japanese troops in Tongzhou, totaling about 2,300 people, also transferred to Dongba. A small-scale regimental exercise was conducted that day, and sounds of gunfire could be faintly heard within the city. The southern suburbs were unaffected because Fengtai was the boundary of the Japanese troops' exercise area. Twenty Japanese troops stationed in Beijing took two heavy trucks at 9:00 AM on the 26th to transport military supplies. They planned to go to Fengtai via You'anmen, but because the road was difficult, they turned back to Yongdingmen and exited the city southward. At about 4:00 PM, the same trucks returned to the city.</p>
<p>In the western suburbs, the Japanese troops are scheduled to concentrate and camp on the 3rd of next month, and exercise and review troops at Babaoshan, 20 li west of Fuchengmen, on the 4th. The encampment locations prepared by our side in the western suburbs are major temples such as Baiyun Temple, Wanshou Temple, Tianning Temple, and Yuanguang Temple, without renting civilian houses. The Western Suburbs District also notified residents not to be alarmed at that time and not to go out to watch without reason. At 7:00 AM on the 26th, more than 400 Japanese troops stationed in Beijing, led by Kawamura, formed a team and exited Xibianmen, passing through the Shifangyuan area of the western suburbs and crossing the Pinghan Railway to exercise west of Lugouqiao in Wanping, launching an offensive towards Lugouqiao. After completing the exercise, they went to Kantan, west of Juetai, to rest and camped in Fengtai that night. On the morning of the 27th, they set off for Dongba. Another group of 460 Japanese troops stationed in Beijing, carrying two large cannons, one heavy cannon, and twenty-one machine guns, exited Guang'anmen at about 11:00 AM on the 26th and went to Lugouqiao via Xiaolin Village in the western suburbs to exercise. At about 4:00 PM, they all returned to Beijing. Along the way, they showed off their military strength, and many people watched. More than 20 Japanese soldiers went to Tiancun. The western suburbs were full of Japanese troops all day on the 26th. In Fengtai, more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers gathered on the drill ground outside the camp on the morning of the 26th and then set off for Lugouqiao to exercise. At about 3:00 PM, 520 Japanese troops remaining in Fengtai went to Tongzhou to exercise. At 5:00 PM, the Japanese troops who had gone to Lugouqiao returned to Jue. Another infantry force of 600 people then marched to Beijing. In Fengtai, in addition to those stationed in the barracks, a total of 290 people lived in inns and lecture halls such as Renhe, Yuelai, Jinfeng, and Heshun. The office was located in the Fengtai Chamber of Commerce. Most of the local residents kept their doors closed and did not go out. Red paper strips were pasted on civilian houses and shops, with the words "Do Not Enter" written on them.</p>
<p>At Lugouqiao, from 4:00 AM to 6:00 AM on the morning of the 26th, 430 infantrymen from the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Column of Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai, led by Battalion Commander Kiyoshi Ichiki, arrived and exercised in the area west of the Daishi Bridge. At 8:30 AM, another 460 people arrived from Beijing, carrying machine guns and steel cannons. They crossed the Lugouqiao in two batches and gathered at the Daishi Bridge, then divided into two groups to conduct confrontational exercises. One group of 200 people was in the southeast, and one group of 400 people was in the southwest. The two sides conducted offensive and defensive battles. At 9:40 AM, 40 artillerymen and 40 cavalrymen continued to arrive from Fengtai, carrying four steel cannons, and joined the exercise. At about 10:00 AM, another 200 infantrymen arrived and also joined the exercise. This exercise was a confrontation between the 10th Battalion and the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment. The sound of gunfire could be heard within 20 li for a time. At noon, they picnicked in various locations. In the afternoon, they continued the exercise until about 2:00 PM, when they completed it and returned to Fengtai separately. One group of 600 people returned to Beijing and still lived in the Japanese barracks. The Political Council, the Pacification Office, and the 29th Army Observation Group, Zhou Yongye and others, followed them to observe. In the afternoon, after the Japanese troops returned to Beijing and Fengtai, they returned to Beijing (26th).</p>
<h3>Suspicion Among a Certain Party: Status of Bandit and Puppet Troops in Northern Chahar</h3>
<p>Wang's Bandit Troops' Brigade Commander Zhang Detained Suddenly; Bao, Zhuo, Zhang, and Li Consult in Zhangbei; A Certain Party Strictly Checks Travelers and Prohibits Reading Newspapers</p>
<p>Zhangbei Dispatch: Since the Jiabusi Conference, the bandit and puppet armies in northern Chahar have been clamoring to unite and advance westward, attempting to invade eastern Suiyuan. However, ten days have passed, and apart from occasional minor skirmishes along the Chahar-Suiyuan border, no major uprisings have been seen. The reason for this is that the puppet bandit troops feel insecure due to the whims of the figures behind the scenes; happiness brings unexpected rewards, but anger could mean loss of position and wealth. Therefore, their own organizations are not very sound, and their troop numbers and military strength are still being expanded, so they have been slow to act.</p>
<p>Bandit and Puppet Leaders Gather in Zhangbei</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the situation in northern Chahar, after Wang Ying was suspected by a certain party, there will be a major reshuffle soon. The title of Commander of the Puppet Anti-Communist Autonomous Army will also be abolished along with Wang Ying. His former puppet deputy commander, Zhang Wanqing, formerly Wang Ying's infantry brigade commander, whose troops numbered about two brigades, has been dismissed. In addition, Zhang, a brigade commander under Wang, came to Zhangbei from Shangdu a few days ago to arrange for the receipt of military supplies and provisions. For some reason, he was suddenly detained by a certain party. Li Shouxin's troops have moved in large numbers from Zhangbei to the northwest in recent days and are currently stalled in the Daqinggou area. Li himself is still in Zhangbei, meeting with Niu Yangqun Banner King Zhuo Shihai, Right Wing Pastoral Group General Manager Selengnabenjile (named Yongcheng), and Zhang HaiPeng, a rebel, for several days to discuss certain matters. It is also said that the former Bordered Yellow Banner General Manager Mukdengbao (i.e., Mu Guihua) will take over as commander of the 7th Division of the puppet Mongolian army. His troops stationed in Kangbao, numbering about several hundred, will soon be stationed in Jiabusi. The Kangbao area they leave behind will be taken over by Bao Yueqing's troops. The Mongolian puppet armies have been changing frequently recently. Since Wang Ying's title of Commander of the Puppet Anti-Communist Autonomous Army has been abolished, a certain party has now approved the reorganization of his troops into a cavalry division, with Wang Ying still serving as commander. Liu Zhiqian and Jin Niansan will serve as brigade commanders. The division will be composed of approximately two brigades, or possibly three.</p>
<p>Replenishing Military Supplies, Purchasing Coal Bricks</p>
<p>Li Shouxin's troops have been actively replenishing military supplies recently. Large quantities of military supplies, such as artillery shells, aircraft engines, and spare parts for vehicles, have been transported from a certain location to Zhangbei by heavy trucks in recent days, with ammunition and rifles being the most numerous. In addition, leather uniforms, gasoline, kerosene, wooden poles for supporting camps, and coal bricks are also numerous. Li is purchasing from Shanxi and a certain location within the Pass, but because the quantity he needs is too large, it is difficult to purchase all at once. On the 24th, more than 1,000 sets of saddles and more than 3,000 sets of military uniforms (both leather and cotton) purchased by Wang Ying's troops were loaded onto five heavy trucks and transported from a certain location through Zhangbei to Shangdu for the soldiers of Wang Ying's bandit troops to wear.</p>
<p>Checking Travelers, Restricting Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The people of northern Chahar live a precarious existence under the iron heel of the puppet bandits, their difficulties reaching the extreme. Not only is their life unsustainable, but their freedom is also deprived. Even the right to read newspapers is not allowed; they are only allowed to read the Shengjing Times published within a certain party's camp. Apart from this, all newspapers from the interior are forbidden, and severe punishments are given if they are found. Therefore, the people are very isolated from national affairs. Currently, Zhangbei is strictly checking travelers; anyone who is slightly suspicious is either detained or expelled. Locals who want to leave the area must find a reliable shop as a guarantor, stating the time limit for their return, and are only allowed to travel after a certain party has issued a permit. This is particularly disadvantageous to the local people. The price of food in various places in northern Chahar has been soaring recently due to restrictions on grain purchases, especially in Kangbao and Baochang. Wheat has risen to 1.40 yuan per dou, and buckwheat is around 1.05 yuan per dou. In the past, one yuan could buy 30 to 40 jin of wheat flour, but the difference in value is more than tenfold. Cattle, sheep, and horses, which are major exports and resources for the people outside the Pass, are also under control. The export of horses is strictly prohibited, and merchants who come from afar within the Pass to purchase horses are suffering greatly. Currently, the price of cattle is around 40 yuan per head, and sheep are 3-4 yuan each. Many are imported every day (24th).</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Celebrates Chairman Chiang's Birthday by Presenting Nine Aircraft: Naming Ceremony to be Held Tomorrow at Jurong Airport, Wang Boling Appointed as Chief Representative for Aircraft Presentation</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Aviation Association has been actively preparing to raise funds from all sectors of Jiangsu Province to purchase aircraft to present to the government as a celebration of Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. It has now been decided that the naming ceremony will be held tomorrow (29th) at Jurong Airport. After the naming ceremony, the aircraft will fly directly to Nanjing for presentation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Aviation Association decided to raise funds from all sectors of Jiangsu Province to purchase aircraft to celebrate the birthday of Chairman Chiang, and proceeded separately through groups such as the Party, government, military, education, and business. The Party Department was responsible for urging contributions, the military, government, police, and judicial departments were responsible for urging contributions through the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the education sector was responsible for urging contributions through the Education Department, and the business sector was responsible for urging contributions through local chambers of commerce and the Provincial Federation of Commerce. The stipulated amount was 720,000 yuan, to purchase a squadron of aircraft (nine planes). The aircraft were purchased by the Central Government, and the funds were gradually remitted to the Central Government. More than 500,000 yuan has already been paid.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Participation</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province will present nine aircraft, but the estimated fundraising results are only expected to yield more than 700,000 yuan, while each aircraft is valued at 100,000 yuan. This amount is only sufficient to purchase seven aircraft, and it seems somewhat lacking to not complete a squadron. The farmers, workers, boy scouts, and various freelance professions in the province have voluntarily and enthusiastically contributed to make up the shortfall, in order to fulfill the people's respect for the leader. There have also been quite a few individuals who have voluntarily donated.</p>
<p>Naming Ceremony</p>
<p>The aircraft presented by Jiangsu Province are scheduled to have their naming ceremony at 2:00 PM on the 29th of this month at the Jurong Airport, and the Jiangsu Provincial Aircraft Presentation and Birthday Celebration Naming Ceremony Preparatory Committee has been established. The committee has been working very hard in recent days. Yu Zhaoqi, a member of the preparation committee, went to Jurong yesterday to arrange everything. The naming of the nine aircraft has been determined to be (1) Jiangsu Merchant One, (2) Jiangsu Merchant Two, (3) Jiangsu Merchant Three, (4) Jiangsu Elementary School Student, (5) Jiangsu Faculty and Student, (6) Jiangsu Party and Government, (7) Jiangsu Political, Legal, Military, and Police, (8) Jiangsu Farmer and Worker, and (9) Jiangsu Boy Scout and Freelance Profession.</p>
<p>Invitation to Participate</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee, in anticipation of this grand event, has previously sent letters to the governments, agencies, and groups in various counties, inviting them to send representatives to Jurong to participate. It also issued a public notice. Representatives from various counties participating in the aircraft presentation naming ceremony are to report to the temporary office of the committee in the Jurong County Government on the morning of the 29th. Those passing through Zhenjiang can report to the Security Office on the 28th. On the morning of the 29th, the committee will provide transportation to Jurong and has arranged with the Jiangsu-Jurong Railway to open a special train on that day to facilitate those attending.</p>
<p>Aircraft Presentation Representative</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province has appointed Committee Member Wang Boling as the plenipotentiary chief representative for the naming and presentation of the aircraft. After the naming ceremony in Jurong, he will fly to Nanjing for the presentation. Representatives from other provincial party and government agencies and agricultural, commercial, educational, military, police, and other groups will also be appointed to participate in the ceremony. Currently, those who have been appointed include Qiu Heqing, Secretary of the Civil Affairs Department, Yao Dechen, Secretary of the Finance Department, Xu Tigang, Secretary of the Construction Department, and Huang Shaohong, Secretary of the Education Department. Representatives from other agricultural, commercial, educational, and other groups will also be appointed.</p>
<p>Urging Contributions</p>
<p>The funds for the nine aircraft presented by Jiangsu Province were collected from various sources, so the contribution process is difficult to unify. The business community alone donated funds for three aircraft, which is sufficient to demonstrate the businessmen's enthusiastic support for the leader. However, because of the large number of donations, it is not easy to collect them all at once. It is reported that the Jiangsu Aviation Association, in addition to discussing with the responsible agencies to send personnel to urge the remittance of the more than 500,000 yuan that has already been remitted to the Central Government, hopes that the remaining amount can be collected and sent to the association in the near future so that it can be remitted to the Central Government.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Opening of First Aid Training</h3>
<p>The Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society is running a first aid training class with a quota of sixty students. Prepared by Director Zhou Xuewen, the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on November 1st, at Chaoguo Temple outside the West Gate. Leaders from all sectors have been invited to visit at that time.</p>
<h3>Agreed on Grain Collection Quality</h3>
<p>This year's autumn harvest is bountiful, and the new grain is gradually appearing on the market. The quality of grain collected for rent is usually discussed and agreed upon at a meeting convened by the county government, attended by representatives from wealthy families and relevant agencies. This year's meeting was held at the county government on the afternoon of the 26th. The result was a decision to collect 7.7 dou of rent rice per stone of the standard rent. The authorities will issue a notice to the public within a few days.</p>
<h3>Four Robberies in One Night Outside the North Gate</h3>
<p>Li Wentian, a resident of the 7th household of the 27th Jia of the 1st Bao of Tongbo Township in Shishitu outside the North Gate, and two farmers from the same Bao, Li Wentian and Li Guanshou, were robbed by more than 20 bandits who broke into their homes at midnight on the 25th. The bandits all spoke in strong Hakka accent, wearing blue clothes and white short shirts and pants, with large hats and carrying rapid-fire guns and pistols. They first tied up Li Wentian and his wife, Gu, and beat them to force them to reveal their valuables, causing injuries. After stealing the valuables, they went to rob the homes of Li Jisheng and Zhang Honggen, two households of the 2nd household of the 5th Jia and the 3rd household of the 9th Jia of the same Bao. Before leaving, they injured Honggen and his wife, Shen, with wooden sticks and took the stolen goods, heading east along the Songsi Road. Afterwards, Li Wentian's family found that they had been robbed of 55 yuan in paper money, more than 20 bolts of native cloth, and two pieces of clothing. Li Guanshou's family was robbed of more than 10 bolts of native cloth, seven silver hairpins, two silver garlic sprout bracelets for children, 5 yuan in paper money, and 500 copper coins. Li Jisheng's family was robbed of a silver hairpin and dozens of pieces of clothing. Zhang Honggen's family was robbed of a gold bracelet, a gold ring, five bolts of native cloth, more than ten pieces of clothing, and three cotton quilts. The victims have filed a report with the Public Security First Sub-bureau, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Traitor Escorted to the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau has recently arrested several suspected traitors who looked like beggars and are currently interrogating them. Yesterday, a man named Pu Yun was arrested on Banmenwai Avenue. Suspicious cards and bamboo chips were found on his person. The police station directly escorted him to the Public Security Bureau. After interrogation by the Third Section, he confessed that he was being used to come to Suzhou to gather certain information. Director Zhang, considering the matter to be related to treason, immediately escorted him to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Unresolved Warehouse Dispute</h3>
<p>Xinshen No. 3 Factory has built a new Renhe warehouse on the open space west of the local railway station for loading and unloading goods. The contract was awarded to contractor Ding Ruixi. However, the workers of the railway warehouse believed that their business was being taken away and rose up in opposition, resulting in a dispute. The day before yesterday, a conflict almost broke out over the loading and unloading of jute bags. Section Chief Chen of the Xihu Police First Section intervened and dispatched police to suppress the situation, preventing a disaster. In order to resolve the matter properly, Section Chief Chen specially invited Station Master Yu Shucheng, Manager Tang Xiongyuan of the Xinren Warehouse, and Accountant Zhang Renshan to discuss solutions. Tang proposed that loading and unloading from the railway station to the warehouse would be handled by railway workers, and loading and unloading from the riverside pier to the warehouse would be handled by the warehouse's workers. Station Master Yu and others largely agreed. However, Ding Ruixi, the warehouse's contractor, stated that the railway workers could only go from the train to the warehouse entrance and not enter the warehouse, resulting in no resolution. Yesterday, the warehouse temporarily suspended the loading and unloading of goods for fear of another conflict, awaiting mediation.</p>
<h3>Appealing Not to Increase Business Tax</h3>
<p>The local Gold and Silver Industry Guild stated that the Jiangsu Finance Department's revised business tax regulations would increase the tax rate for jewelry stores from 10 per mille to 15 per mille. The jewelry store business relies on women's ornaments for sales. Since the popularity of women's haircuts in 1928, ornaments have been hit hard. Business has plummeted. After the January 28th Incident, the economy declined, rural areas went bankrupt, and the market became even more depressed. Paying taxes at the original rate is already an unbearable burden. If the tax rate is increased again, it would increase the burden on merchants and put the jewelry store industry in a dire situation. Therefore, they specially sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting them to forward it to the Finance Department, requesting that it withdraw its order and continue to levy taxes at the original rate of 10 per mille in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<h3>Water and Land Public Security Conference</h3>
<p>Zang Qifang, the Second District Administrative Inspector and Commissioner, believes that it is time for winter defense. The counties under his jurisdiction are located at the intersection of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, bordering both rivers and lakes, making them extremely important. All local security should be closely linked. Therefore, he convened a water and land public security conference this morning (28th). All district chiefs of the Provincial Water Public Security Corps Second District and the captains of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth River Teams, the captains of the Jingping, Anjing, Peirong, and Jinghu warships stationed in Kunshan, Wuxian, Wuxi, and Wujiang counties, and the directors of the public security bureaus of Wuxi, Wujin, Wuxian, Wujiang, Changshu, Jiangyin, Kunshan, and Taicang counties all attended and participated in the discussion.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Foreign Soldiers Land in Baimao</h3>
<p>According to a phone call from Hupu, a shallow-water warship of a certain country arrived outside Hupu Port the day before yesterday afternoon to measure the water level and left in the evening. On the afternoon of the 26th, a warship of a certain country also arrived outside Baimao Port to conduct measurements and used a small boat to carry five or six soldiers ashore to drink tea in a teahouse. However, it was only for a short time, and they immediately boarded the boat and returned to the warship, sailing downstream. The local Public Security Bureau, seeing this situation, specially contacted the District Office and telegraphed the county government for instructions. Subsequently, the county government also discussed solutions and reported to the province for instructions.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Trains First Aid Team</h3>
<p>Yu Jiusi, Director of the local Red Cross Branch, believes that rescue workers are urgently needed in the YiLai (area). In order to cope with future events, thirty members have been selected for first aid training. The curriculum includes basic first aid knowledge, initial treatment, poison prevention, stretcher techniques, and artificial respiration. The opening ceremony was held this morning (27th) in the county government auditorium, and classes will begin in the afternoon. The duration is two months, and Shimei Elementary School has been designated as the lecture hall and the sports field as the training ground. Many members have requested training, and a second class will be held soon.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Strange Guests Suddenly Arrive at Duanshan Port</h3>
<p>Duanshan Port in the Third District Shazhou is a major Yangtze River port. A few days ago, five or six foreigners suddenly landed from a small boat, carrying a camera. They gave the brought biscuits to local cattle herding children, signaling them to eat. The children refused. They took pictures everywhere. The tax police stationed there, seeing their suspicious behavior but not understanding their language, could not stop them. They lingered for several hours and took the original boat to the east. The local Zhuangding (militia) team has reported this matter to higher-level agencies for investigation.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Two Murderers Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Cao Jintao, a farmer from Qinnian Township in Tongyi (Nantong), had an affair with Ji Caoshi, a young woman next door. Her husband, Ji Xiaobin, suddenly returned home from Shanghai. Cao Jintao and Ji Caoshi jointly strangled Ji Xiaobin, buried the body in the field, and eliminated the traces. The district office discovered the case and reported it. The two criminals were brought to court, and both confessed without hesitation. On the 26th, the criminal court concluded the trial. Ji Caoshi and Cao Jintao were each sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Private Intelligence Agency</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's pilot project for the Tongruhaichongqi District reconnaissance smuggling intelligence agency has received a telegram ordering reorganization. Director Gan Zhaoting has gone to Shanghai for instructions.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Wheat Seedlings Damaged by Locusts</h3>
<p>There has been no rain in the county for the past two months, and the drought is about to cause a disaster. Farmers in various townships are unable to sow seeds. Most are using manual labor or pumping water into the fields to facilitate the cultivation of winter wheat. They are hoping for rain day and night. Even the vegetable gardens in the city are difficult to grow due to the drought, causing prices to skyrocket. The low-lying fields in the eastern townships have already planted wheat seeds, but unexpectedly, locusts are rampant, and all the wheat seedlings have been eaten. Farmers are crying out in pain and must resow the seeds. In addition, the price of wheat is extremely high. No. 1 wheat in the county has reached 10.05 yuan, and secondary wheat has reached 10.03 yuan. In addition, the sauce gardens in the county traditionally pickle radish in the fall. Due to the drought, production has been greatly reduced, and prices have also risen, reaching more than one yuan per stone. All the stores are going to Huai'an and Baoying to purchase.</p>
<h3>Removing Obstacles Along the Canal</h3>
<p>The Yangqing Highway follows the canal bank. There are many obstacles along the canal, which pose a great danger to traffic. The highway administration has ordered the county to remove them, but it has not been done. The county government has appointed Jia Chengchun, the third section chief, and Yu Yunhu, the director of the first public security sub-bureau, to lead a team of police to the Cheqian area south of the county to persuade the removal of houses and other objects that obstruct traffic. Otherwise, they will be forcibly removed to facilitate traffic and ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Cixi: Fundraising for Hongguan Road</h3>
<p>The Cixi County Government believes that the funds for Cixi-Yang Road are insufficient, the project has been suspended, and efforts should be made to continue it. In order to facilitate transportation in the northern mountains, the planned construction of Hongguan Road should also be implemented. After the county magistrate convened a meeting of local gentry, it was decided that the construction of Hongguan Road would be funded by levying 0.35 yuan per mu of farmland in the northern mountains (totaling 17,000 mu), with the landowner bearing 0.25 yuan and the tenant bearing 0.1 yuan. The estimated construction cost is tentatively set at 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Fresh Cocoons of Late Autumn Silkworms</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Cocoon and Silk Control Association has purchased more than 90,000 sheets of late autumn silkworm eggs this year and distributed them to various counties in western Zhejiang, including Haining, Haiyan, Chongde, Tongxiang, Wuxing, and Deqing, for rearing. They have now successively spun cocoons. However, due to the drought and dry mulberry leaves, the harvest of late autumn cocoons is only about 60%. The silk factories, due to the lack of raw materials, are enthusiastically requesting approval to register to purchase cocoons. The association has reviewed and approved the requests. The price of fresh cocoons is based on reeling yield, ranging from 30 to 33.8 yuan, and has been submitted to the provincial government for record. Recently, some early batches of fresh cocoons have appeared.</p>
<h3>The Severity of Drought in Various Counties</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn in Zhejiang Province, there has been no rain for two months, resulting in an extreme drought. In the western counties of Zhejiang, due to the flat terrain and numerous rivers, the irrigation of late rice has not been significantly affected and harvesting is expected to begin early next month. While the harvest may not be abundant, the eastern counties of Zhejiang, with their more mountainous terrain and limited water sources, are experiencing severe water shortages. Rivers in the counties under Shaoxing Prefecture are gradually drying up, hindering navigation. Paddy fields are cracking due to the lack of water, causing significant damage to the late rice crop and preventing the planting of wheat. The drought is severely impacting agriculture. Furthermore, there is a shortage of drinking water in various counties, and the water is often unclean and turbid, leading to the rampant spread of epidemics.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Orders Exhibition of History and Geography Achievements</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department believes that history and geography education in primary and secondary schools is the most effective training for cultivating national culture, enriching international knowledge, understanding the current environment, and inspiring patriotism in young people. Therefore, when drafting the provincial education implementation plan for the 25th year of the Republic, it was included as a task to urge all secondary and normal schools to hold regional exhibitions of student achievements in history and geography, with the aim that both public and private secondary and normal schools will hold exhibitions of student achievements in history and geography within the year, so as to learn from each other and promote the subject. As the school year has already begun for almost two months, the above plan must be implemented. Inspectors have been instructed to discuss the implementation methods of the exhibition with the school authorities and history and geography teachers during their inspections. If regional exhibitions are difficult to organize immediately, each school can hold its own exhibition separately. After most schools have completed their exhibitions, the best exhibits can be selected by the schools to determine the location for a regional exhibition and prepare for it at a later date. This step-by-step approach is more economical in terms of manpower and resources, and the exhibition effect will be more comprehensive and lasting than if it were held within a limited time frame.</p>

<h3>Unified Youth Cultivation (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ying Guan</p>
<p>(1) Establishing a Conscious Central Concept</p>
<p>This concept is to develop our sound personality. The so-called sound means harmless, evenly developed, harmonious, and complete. The so-called personality includes the physical body, knowledge, skills, behavior, emotions, will, and all aspects of a person's form and spirit. We receive education and training to cultivate and develop a sound personality. All subjects, tasks, and activities are means to achieve this great purpose. It itself is not an end. We must strive for physical education to develop a strong physique, but a strong physique is to cultivate rich knowledge and skills and develop a sound will and character to serve society and humanity. It is not enough to have a strong body to be a player. Every young person should establish such a conscious concept. Then all courses and tasks are for my use, and I am the main body of all work and activities. Although the types of work are numerous, I have a grand purpose and deal with them calmly according to certain steps, not counting success. Why should I be flustered and busy? In the past, educational discussions often divided the scope of activities into three aspects: moral, intellectual, and physical. Later, some advocated adding group education and aesthetic education. In fact, morality is not isolated and must have a group relationship. Aesthetic education cannot be separated from the three aspects of morality, intelligence, and physique. Whether it is the saying of three educations or five educations, there is always a bit of fragmentation and division. Now we should abandon these discussions and only establish a central concept of developing a sound personality in the youth's consciousness, so that their minds can be calm and their spirits concentrated, so that they can study hard and not be scattered, disorganized, confused, and at a loss.</p>
<p>(2) Saving Study Time</p>
<p>With a unified and conscious central concept, the second step is how to save study time. At present, high school students have very little remaining self-study time each day besides class, extracurricular sports, and activities. If we do not pay attention to saving and utilizing it, we will definitely feel more short and insufficient. Many hardworking students get up early to read, reading between classes and after class, before and after meals, and even a few minutes before going to bed, burying themselves in books all day long, practicing the ancient訓 of cherishing every minute. But this method cannot be regarded as truly utilizing time. The real way to utilize time is to first have a limit. Time within the limit should be allocated very reasonably and fully utilized. Time outside the limit should be completely used for rest and play. Rest is static, and play is active. When resting, rest heartily. When playing, play happily. At this time, in addition to maintaining no counter-learning effect, there is absolutely no room for learning. The so-called counter-learning effect means that, for example, we have learned various sheet music in music class according to the fixed solfeggio method. During rest, it is okay to sing arbitrarily to express our feelings, but we cannot arbitrarily change the heights of the tones. Another example is that various hygiene habits have been clarified and familiarized. During rest, there cannot be arbitrary spitting and other situations. We should still maintain various good habits. In short, study time and rest time should be clearly divided. There must be no situation of seeming to study but not studying, seeming to rest but not resting. It is extremely harmful to waste time in a daze. How much is this reasonable time limit? Before there are accurate experimental results to rely on, we have to assume that junior high school and its equivalent schools have eight hours per day, and high school and certain equivalent schools have nine to ten hours per day. As for the largest unit of continuous study time, we can adopt the traditional method of 50 minutes per class. Taking 50 minutes as the limit, after completing 50 minutes of study, there must be a rest of 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 15 minutes. The total length should be determined according to the complexity of the task. However, there should always be a break in the middle to recover from the fatigue of studying. At present, junior high school students have 31 hours of class per week according to the revised curriculum standards, and the Boy Scout training extracurricular hour is also equal to a regular class, so the total is 32 hours, averaging 5 hours and 20 minutes per day. Calculated in actual time, it is 4 hours and 27 minutes, and the self-study time should be 3 hours and 33 minutes. In addition to the usual 2 hours of self-study in the evening, which actually amounts to 1 hour and 40 minutes, it is necessary to make up for 1 hour and 57 minutes of self-study. Approximately 30 minutes can be used for self-study in the morning, and the remaining 87 minutes must be allocated appropriately in the afternoon. High school students have an average of 9 hours of class per day according to the revised curriculum standards, which actually amounts to 4 hours and 10 minutes. That means there must be 4 hours and 50 minutes or 5 hours and 50 minutes of self-study every day, which is particularly busy. If, due to physical or psychological reasons, you cannot concentrate or feel tired when studying, it is better to reduce the working hours slightly, but the minimum limit cannot be less than 7 hours for junior high school and cannot be less than 8 hours or 8 and a half hours for high school. In addition to having a fixed study scope during class, the allocation of self-study time should be based on the preview and review of each subject, as well as the amount of teaching materials, the difficulty of the content. Each young person should appropriately allocate their own situation. There is one principle to be observed, that is, each subject must strive to achieve the passing standard. If there is remaining energy, read more reference books and do more research work on your favorite subjects. Regarding the allocation of time, it is best to prepare a card every day. From morning to night, record the subject of each study (including class) and the start and end of the time one by one after the study is completed. In this way, you can check the allocation of time for each subject and how much the total study time for the day is still short and should be made up at any time. This is easy to do. Pay attention to it at the beginning, and it will become a habit later. When the allocation of time for each subject and the limit of total study time can be followed from the heart without overstepping the rules, you can no longer need to register. During any kind of study, the most important thing to pay attention to is to concentrate and study attentively. Never let your mind be disturbed and think wildly. Especially in class, a common problem for young people is that they sometimes do not want to listen to unsatisfactory teaching. You must know that learning is for your own use, not responsible to others. You should not let its effect be interrupted, resulting in bad habits that are difficult to correct.</p>
<p>(3) Adopting an Attitude of Only Asking About Cultivation and Not Asking About Harvest</p>
<p>The problem with young people now is not the lack of purpose, but the eagerness to achieve the purpose. Therefore, after having a unified and conscious concept and working hard according to the method of saving time, they are eager to achieve success, often unable to satisfy themselves and feeling bored. They do not know that learning is cumulative, and there is no reason to suddenly get rich. Young people should adopt an attitude of only asking about cultivation and not asking about harvest, set a direction, and steadily build a solid foundation. Then the cultivation of personality can naturally be more than enough on a daily basis, and more than enough on a monthly basis, and more than enough on a yearly basis. (The End)</p>

<h3>Student Hard Court Tennis Round Robin Finals: Li Guofan's Hope is Stronger, Li and Ye Baosheng will Play a Makeup Game Today</h3>
<p>After the elimination results of the student hard court tennis tournament, only Li, Tang, Ye, and Cai were left in the end. The round robin tournament was held last weekend. Except for the match between Li Guofan and Ye Baosheng, which was rescheduled to be played at Jiaotong University this afternoon, the other three matches were contested as scheduled. As for the two matches between Tang vs. Li and Ye vs. Cai, they could not be played this week due to unforeseen circumstances and will be postponed. The results of each group last week are as follows:</p>
<p>Final Four Round Robin Tournament: Each person needs to play three times. Only four games have been completed (the Li-Ye game has been scheduled for today). There are still two games left. Because the players have to participate in the French Chamber of Commerce Hard Court Championship this week, they will be held on a date next week. The gains and losses of today's Li-Ye game are very important to the championship. The current trend of the championship is that except for Cai Guoji, who has already failed twice and has no hope at all, Tang Baojia has also failed once. However, Li, Ye, and Tang have each won once. According to the observation of strength, Ye Baosheng still has a game against Cai Guoji, and the victory must belong to Ye. Therefore, today's Li-Ye battle can also be called the final. If Ye is unfortunately defeated by Li, and Li is defeated by Tang, then the three will tend to be tied again, and a triangular round robin will be required. However, the hope of the championship seems to be stronger for Li Guofan.</p>
<h3>Team Billiards Championship: Change in Scoring Method</h3>
<p>Open Tournament Registration Deadline at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Billiards Association held its annual meeting at its new venue and elected nine executive committee members for this year: two Chinese and seven Westerners. Old Chairman Mr. Bernal left Shanghai, and Mr. Lie Maijun was publicly elected to succeed him, with Clark as his deputy, Bi Liqu was appointed as honorary secretary, and Packer was appointed as honorary accountant. Since someone is responsible for the association's affairs, the progress of this year's event was continued. Among the resolutions, the most important one was to change the method of determining the victory or defeat of "inter-association" competitions. In the past, the order was determined by the number of wins and losses. Now it is changed to judge the level by the number of points. Each association or team has five players, each with 300 points, totaling 1,500 points. A double round robin system is adopted, meeting each other twice, once in each other's location, to show fairness. The association hopes that the Chinese and Western sports associations and institutions in the city with excellent talents and perfect facilities, such as the Shanghai Banking Club, the French Chamber of Commerce, the Western Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese YMCA, the Western Overseas YMCA, the International Sports Association, and the Portuguese General Association, will participate in the cooperation. As for other advanced and primary open tournaments and the Slacker tournament, the registration deadline is still set at the end of this month, and the competition will start on the 16th of next month.</p>

<h3>Recent Overview of Soviet Russian Sports</h3>
<p>— Song Ruhai</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian Federation is indeed a country worthy of the most attention from all countries in the world today. Since the revolution in 1917, only 19 years have passed, and in these 19 years, the rapid progress and effectiveness of social, economic, cultural, and political advancements are truly amazing in human history, surpassing any country in the world. Now, the people of the whole country are all inspired by the enthusiasm of "creating a new world," and everyone is working hard to move forward and catch up, participating in the so-called "communist socialist activities" with one heart. Before the revolution, everyone knew that Russia was the most backward nation in Europe. The unsound organization of the state and society, the lack of education, the underdeveloped science, the demoralized people, the superstition of ghosts and gods, class struggle, and racial conflict were all countless, which was the cause of the revolution. However, after the revolution, Soviet Russia suddenly jumped from an agricultural society to an industrial society. Not to mention other things, just in terms of the railway lines in the country, they have now reached all parts of the country. In addition, the most striking thing is the great factories in various cities, towering into the clouds, standing side by side, and their architectural styles are all constructed according to the latest scientific methods. Secondly, the lives of farmers have also been greatly improved. Four-fifths of the country's farmers have organized rural cooperatives, and the rest are engaged in imitation. There are currently more than 385,500 agricultural machines in rural areas. In addition, the Soviet Russian Arctic icebreaker sails on Arctic expeditions every winter, about several times. Especially for training aircraft pilots, every big city has training centers. About 100,000 ordinary people participate in skydiving on airplanes. This is to practice for future foreign aggression. These people can use airplanes to invade enemy territory and disrupt the enemy's rear. This kind of sport is now the most effort in European countries and is the only trend of the newest type of warfare. Also, the Soviet Russian railway line goes directly to Central Asia, deep into the barren land, and wants to use the latest agricultural machinery and electricity in no man's land to cultivate this kind of wilderness and establish state-owned collective farms. During this process of rapid transformation, the Soviet Union not only focuses on the increase in material quantity, but also constantly seeks to transform the purpose of life, psychological construction, family organization, marriage of men and women, social education, and other issues.</p>
<p>During the era of the Russian Tsar, the authority of the empire was used to control small and weak nations. There were about 189 kinds of such nations within Russia. At that time, all of them were regarded as slaves and concubines, but after the revolution, all the small and weak nations were regarded as equal citizens by the Soviet Russian Federation. Now, men and women of all ethnic groups enjoy equal education. They also have the right to vote and be elected in politics. Moreover, the central government uses the languages of various states to publish daily newspapers, establish schools, public theaters, etc. In Central Asia, more than 11,000 public schools and more than 300 kinds of daily newspapers have been established, paying special attention to social education. Children's production registration offices, public childcare bureaus, parks, public sports fields, swimming pools, skating rinks, dance halls, music halls, workers' clubs, children's parks, young pioneer camps, etc. are set up in urban areas. Major railway stations have set up child custody offices. Women traveling with children, from swaddling clothes to eight years old, can be entrusted to them for a period of time from six hours to two days. Therefore, all mothers find it extremely convenient. All the facilities for serving social work are available. Speaking of the Soviet Russian territory, it accounts for one-sixth of the world's area, with more than 8 million square miles of land and a population of about 170 million, with as many as 189 kinds of races. It is admirable to be able to cooperate and jointly organize this new type of communist society. Let us describe the current situation of sports development from this brief historical background.</p>
<p>Soviet Russian leader Stalin often used sincere words to say to the people in his speeches: "The human body structure is a kind of generative machine. We should pay special attention to making this machine sound in its entirety, and then we can manage and use various mechanical machines made by human hands." Indeed, the Soviet Russian five-year plan is not only amazing in the development of social economy, industry, and agriculture, but also shows amazing results in social education and public sports. Under this new system, the output of factories, farms, and mining areas has increased several times. The level of national education, scientific common sense, and worker skills have also been greatly improved. Men and women of all classes in the country do their best to produce and do their best to rush to create the supply of materials, so that each individual can jointly enjoy the happiness of materials. In 1939, the labor world produced a new type of movement called Stakhanorite. This movement is popular in factories, rural areas, mining areas, government agencies, education circles, etc. across the country. Stakhanorite is a worker in a coal mining area. He worked especially hard in his mining work. His daily output was more than double that of the workers in the entire mining area. Therefore, the labor world used his working speed as a model and initiated this movement to promote the speed of working time and expand the output of factories and farmland. Since this linkage was initiated, in less than two years, the national workers and farmers have been working hard to move forward and catch up. Each person has worked diligently and diligently to get this honorable title. If a worker gets this title, the wages will also be doubled. Ordinary workers only earn 150 rubles per day (each ruble is equal to 1.3 yuan in national currency). If they get this title, their monthly salary can be increased to 500 to 1,000 rubles. Since the generation record of this movement, the special skills of the labor world have increased by thousands of people every year, and the output of workers, farmers, and mines has doubled every year. People's lives have therefore improved. During this economic development, the authorities believe that promoting people's health is an indispensable way.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union established the Central Supreme Sports Committee (Svpreme Council for Phyoical Tcainino) in 1930, and established branches in various cities, factories, mining areas, collective farms, railway lines, troops, and agencies. The facilities for physical education are planned strictly. The sports branch in each place reports its methods and results to the Central Sports Committee at the end of each semester. The central government also stipulates an Efficiency Test called B.G.T.O. (Beadvfor Labour and Defence) for boys and girls from 14 to 16 years old, and the second is called Readv for Laboor andDefence.e G.T O. for young men and women over 16 years old. The purpose is to train young people to serve labor and prepare for national defense. These two physical fitness test standards stipulate 14 kinds of sports items as shown in the following figure: (To be continued)</p>

Chairman Ma recently went to Beijing to meet with President Chiang and requested an extension of his original six-month leave by five months, which was approved by President Chiang. President Chiang also gave Ma 10,000 yuan for travel expenses, which was handed over to Tan Kemin, member and Secretary-General of the Qinghai Provincial Government, to be forwarded. Ma has already telegraphed his gratitude to President Chiang for his preferential treatment of border personnel.</p>
<p>Ma's Remarks</p>
<p>Chairman Ma said in an interview on the ship before his departure, "I am going abroad to Mecca for pilgrimage this time, and the trip will take about four months. I am scheduled to return to China in mid-March next year. During my absence, Ma Bufang will act as chairman of Qinghai Province. My previous visit to Beijing was very good, and I am especially grateful and excited for the preferential treatment given to border personnel by President Chiang and the central authorities. However, due to the short time in Beijing, I did not have the opportunity to visit the capital's agencies and construction projects, so I plan to stay in Beijing for a while after returning to China next year to visit in detail before returning to Qinghai to preside over the provincial government."</p>

<h3>Yesterday Was U.S. Navy Day; U.S. Warship Sailors Stationed in Shanghai Given Leave to Go Ashore for Entertainment</h3>
<p>Yesterday was U.S. Navy Day. Sailors from the seventeen U.S. warships docked in the port were given leave to go ashore for entertainment. Therefore, many entertainment venues, cafes, and bars were filled with U.S. sailors. This holiday began in 1922 and was initiated by the U.S. Navy League. Since then, celebrations have been held every year on this day. The reason for choosing October 27 is that it is the birthday of Roosevelt. As Assistant Secretary of the Navy and President, Roosevelt promoted the Navy with all his might, so it is used to commemorate his achievements. On October 1775, the U.S. Congress also passed a bill on this day to allocate US$100,000 to create the Navy and appointed a committee to purchase warships. Twenty-three years later, the Department of the Navy was established and gradually expanded the Navy. Today, the U.S. Navy has become one of the most powerful in the world.</p>
<h3>Today is Czech National Day; Czech Nationals Hold Celebrations</h3>
<p>Today is the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic. Czech nationals all over the world are holding celebrations on this day. The Czech Embassy and Czech nationals in this port are also holding celebrations. The territory of the Czech Republic was originally part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the European War, the Czech people openly rebelled against the Habsburg Dynasty. Czech prisoners of war in Russia formed the Czech Foreign Legion and fought on the Russian side, galloping across Siberia, occupying the railway that crossed the area, and advancing to Vladivostok to return home to advocate independence. At that time, Czech soldiers in the Austrian army on various fronts fled to the Allied forces and formed independent armies, establishing great military achievements. Their political leaders, Professor Masaryk and Dr. Beneš, also fled abroad to fight tirelessly for the liberation of the Czech nation. As a result, after losing independence and freedom for three hundred years, they were able to announce the establishment of the Republic in Prague on October 28, 1918. Its first president was Professor Masaryk. After taking office, he worked hard to govern the country, and the country's fortunes continued to rise until 1935, when Dr. Beneš was re-elected as his successor. From the day the country was founded to the day he took office as president, he was in charge of diplomacy, and his political achievements were admired by people all over Europe. Czech foreign policy aims to maintain peace in Central Europe and to cooperate with member states of the League of Nations. Therefore, it formed the Little Entente with Yugoslavia and Romania. In the past ten years, this alliance has been the main factor in maintaining peace in Central Europe. Later, the Little Entente revived Greece and Turkey and established the Balkan Pact to maintain peace in southeastern Europe. The Czech Republic's peaceful policy and that of the Little Entente always complemented France's peaceful policy. This year, the Czech Republic revived cooperation with the Soviet Union, and European peace has gained another layer of security. Although the Czech Republic has been established for eighteen years, its domestic industry and commerce have developed rapidly, and its economy and finance have become increasingly consolidated. In these eighteen years, there have been no internal conflicts in the country, making it a very peaceful place in Central Europe. And at a time when dictatorships are prevalent today, the Czech Republic still maintains its democratic parliamentary system, which is a special feature.</p>

<h3>Yang Yongtai's Family Flew to Wuhan Yesterday Morning; Mrs. Yang Stopped Going Due to Illness; Hired Technicians Also Cancelled at the Last Minute</h3>
<p>Yang Yongtai, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, was assassinated and killed. After learning of the tragedy, his family in Shanghai made plans. Mrs. Yang, Yang's wife, and his third, fourth, and fifth daughters were originally scheduled to take a boat to Wuhan the night before, but she was stopped by friends and relatives due to excessive grief and physical exhaustion, as well as her pre-existing heart disease. The luggage was first sent to Wuhan on the Jiangshun boat. She is scheduled to go after one week of recuperation. Her third, fourth, and fifth daughters, as well as her eldest daughter, Ms. Yi Xi, and six relatives and friends, also took a China National Aviation Corporation plane at 6:30 yesterday morning to rush to Wuhan to personally see the funeral and burial. Yesterday, the Yang residence received a telegram from the funeral home in Wuhan stating that Yang's remains were encoffined at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Originally, the Yang residence planned to hire Sun Zhicheng, a technician from the China Funeral Home in Shanghai, and Sike Luo to fly to Wuhan with Yang's eldest daughter to apply makeup to Yang's remains, but this was temporarily cancelled due to time constraints, as it was no longer necessary. Therefore, the two technicians did not go yesterday. Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, and Chief of Staff Ouyang Ju sent a telegram to Chairman Yang Yongtai's funeral home and Yang's family in Hubei to express their condolences. The original telegram said, "Please forward to the funeral home of Chairman Yang Changqing in Wuhan Provincial Government, Mrs. Yang and her sons and daughters: The guards were not vigilant, and he suffered a fatal attack. The disaster has not subsided, and the prime minister was murdered. This is truly a misfortune for the country and is mourned by the world. We hope that you will restrain your grief and assist in the major affairs. Everything about the funeral is of particular concern to us. Special telegram to express our condolences, Yang Hu, Ouyang Ju."</p>
<h3>After the Agricultural Loans from the China Cotton Corporation, Cotton from Northern Jiangsu is Transported to Shanghai; More Than 2,000 Bundles Arrived the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to an industry source, more than ten banks in this city, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Trust, and Continental Bank, sent personnel to inspect the areas in northern Jiangsu and negotiate agricultural loans for cotton cultivation. They then jointly organized the China Cotton Corporation and established a general office in Shanghai and branch offices in Nantong, Haimen, Funing, Dongtai, and other places to handle cotton transportation and sales loans, in order to adjust the rural economy. Yesterday, reporters learned that the amount of agricultural loans issued by the corporation's offices in various places was very large. Since various yarn and stone raw materials in Shanghai are quite scarce, the corporation specially notified them to quickly transport new cotton to Shanghai for purchase by various factories. The day before yesterday, more than 2,000 bundles of cotton from Nantong, Haimen, Funing, and other places in northern Jiangsu were transported to Shanghai one after another. It is said that more cotton will be transported to Shanghai in succession.</p>
<h3>The Minyuan Steamer Ran Aground Midway; It Escaped Danger and Went to Yichang; Passenger Li Denghui Transferred to Minfeng to Go to Sichuan</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Industrial Company commissioned the Jiangnan Shipyard to build two sister ships, Minben and Minyuan. After completion, they were dedicated to the Shanghai-Chongqing route. The gross tonnage of the ship is 1,500 tons, and the net tonnage is 600 tons. On the 21st of this month, it loaded cargo and passengers in Shanghai and sailed to Chongqing. At 5:00 PM on the 25th, it sailed to the Yidu County section of the Yangtze River above Hankou and below Yichang. Because the river water was very shallow in this section, the ship's draft reached nine and a half feet, which caused it to run aground. The shipowner tried to rescue it without success, and immediately reported to the general and branch offices in Chongqing, Yichang, Hankou, and Shanghai by radio. After receiving the telegram, the Yichang branch office sent a ship to rescue it. Coincidentally, the Minfeng ship of the company's Shenyu Line, which was sailing from Shanghai to Chongqing, passed the grounding site of the Minyuan. It transferred passengers, including Li Denghui, the former president of Fudan University in Shanghai, to the ship, and continued to sail to Chongqing as usual. The ship sent by Yichang to rescue it has arrived and unloaded the cotton yarn and cloth that the Minyuan was carrying in order to reduce the draft. It is expected to be able to escape danger after the tide rises.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Minsheng Company received a radio report from the Minyuan ship yesterday stating that it had floated out of the shallows and was sailing to Yichang.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Aircraft Not Paid for Donations; Deadline for Payment is Before the 30th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Committee is purchasing aircraft to present to the government to commemorate Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday.

All sectors and organizations that have pledged to donate but have not yet paid, or have not yet donated, are requested to pay and remit before the 30th of this month. The Shanghai aircraft purchase birthday celebration donation is set at one million yuan. The aircraft purchase memorial committee has already remitted 330,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan in advance. In addition, the former China Aviation Association transferred 105,430.91 yuan from its fundraising achievements and miscellaneous donations to this city after its dissolution, totaling 635,430.91 yuan in national currency. In addition to the remittances, there is still a shortfall of 364,569.09 yuan. It is said that the director of the aircraft purchase memorial committee, Li Dachao, received a verbal instruction from Mayor Wu to urge all sectors and organizations to pay as soon as possible and remit it to the Chairman Chiang's Birthday Aircraft Donation Memorial Committee before the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Shenxin No. 2 and 5 Factories Will Start Work</h3>
<p>Since the Bank of China and the Bank of Shanghai jointly formed a management committee for Shenxin Textile Company, Factory No. 2 has been granted a factory base and a loan of 2.76 million yuan to repay old debts. Factory Director Rong Erren and Deputy Engineer Rong Dexin have been organizing everything at the factory these days, actively preparing for work. More than a hundred workers have been recruited for the security department, and test runs began yesterday. More than 2,000 other workers are also starting to register.

<h3>Gao Hanqian Returns from European Inspection Tour, Discussing Wartime Finance and Controlled Economy, Departs for Japan Again Yesterday for Further Investigation</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that Mr. Gao Hanqian, formerly dispatched by the Fujian Provincial Government to various European countries to study political economy, has now completed his mission and returned to China, residing at the East Asia Hotel. The reporter, recognizing Mr. Gao's many years of experience in finance, believed that his return from this inspection tour must have yielded valuable insights, and therefore sought an interview. Mr. Gao responded that he had visited over ten European countries and received the care of the embassies, which greatly facilitated the collection of materials for his studies. However, political economy is a vast field, and he initially planned to focus on: 1. Wartime finance, 2. Controlled resources, 3. Management of production enterprises. These three items are also quite complex, and due to time constraints, he would only provide a brief overview.</p>
<p>All countries are preparing for wartime finance with increasing intensity. Many countries have experience from the First World War, making it easier to proceed. Regarding the tax system, indirect taxes are fluid and likely to be greatly affected during wartime. More stable direct taxes, such as income tax and inheritance tax, should be implemented. After the outbreak of war, wartime public bonds can be raised and wartime paper money issued. Securities with foreign value should be collected; Germany advocates nationalizing these securities, while Britain and France advocate that national banks purchase them at market value.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has comprehensive management of production enterprises. Since 1929, the world has been in recession, but the Netherlands restricts imports and exports of goods from stores, basing them on the amount in 1928. Any excess is temporarily stored in warehouses. For example, if a family raises five cows and ten sows, they are allowed to keep one calf and two piglets from the next year's production. Any excess can be distributed by the government as food for the unemployed and impoverished. These are just a few examples to illustrate the rest.</p>
<p>Italy's controlled economy is particularly well-planned. Since 1923, when Mussolini came to power, he observed that countries were supporting laborers by organizing unions, while also protecting capitalists and allowing them to shut down freely. This resulted in labor-capital confrontation, mutual loss, and plunging the social economy into an irrecoverable state. Mussolini first declared that workers' strikes and employers' free factory closures were strictly prohibited. Laws were enacted to organize labor-capital industry groups, with a central labor-capital mutual aid department, headed by Mussolini himself. Under the department, there was a national labor-capital mutual aid conference, composed of nine major industry associations, twenty-two labor-capital mutual aid societies, a standing executive committee, and a resident expert committee. Most committee members were representatives elected by county industry associations to participate in provincial industry federations, and representatives from provincial federations participated in national industry federations. Representatives from the national federation then attended the national conference of the labor-capital mutual aid department.</p>
<p>First, in terms of labor-capital adjustment, cooperative and mutual aid groups are integrated, preventing conflict and promoting coexistence and prosperity, achieving the effect of sharing the same boat. Second, in terms of adjusting statistics, systematic and organized groups report sequentially from county to province to nation, comprehensively and completely, without any omissions. Third, in terms of a controlled economy, the quantity of agricultural production is based on the needs of factory manufacturing and the limits of commodity sales, using commerce to control industry and industry to control agriculture, eliminating the concern of overproduction. Moreover, the government can concentrate a certain amount of manpower, financial resources, and material resources within a certain period for internal administration or external warfare, with prior calculations leading to successful outcomes, which is natural.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Negotiates with the Three Banks, Borrows One Million, Director Cheng Returns to Hangzhou the Night Before</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Cheng Yuanfan, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, noting that the first principal and interest payment period for the 60 million yuan public bond consolidation is November 15th, with a total payment of 2.53 million yuan, in addition to the ordinary business tax, land tax construction special donation, central subsidy for land tax construction surtax and other income specified in the regulations to be returned to the Public Bond Fund Management Committee as a fund for compensation of principal and interest, there is still a shortfall of about one million yuan, and it is planned to borrow it temporarily from the Central Bank, Bank of China and Bank of Communications.

<h3>China Agricultural Loan Syndicate, Anhui Agricultural Warehouse Loan, Totaling One Million Yuan, Six Thousand Yuan Already Loaned</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the China Agricultural Loan Syndicate, since signing an agricultural warehouse storage loan agreement with the Anhui Finance and Construction Departments for one million yuan, designating Fengyang and other counties as loan areas, the warehouses in each county have now been completed, and the syndicate has begun lending. As of now, approximately 60,000 yuan has been loaned, all in accordance with the provisions of the signed contract. As for the rumors that the syndicate plans to build cotton warehouses, Li Zhongchu, the managing director of the syndicate, denied this yesterday, saying that the news was speculation by the general public, and the syndicate has no such plan, or it may be a misunderstanding of the syndicate's new handling of the Anhui agricultural warehouse storage loan.</p>
<h3>Reduced Stamp Tax, Order to Step Up Supervision, Tax Office Transmits Orders to Supervisors</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the stamp tax and tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus of each province and city, and the stamp tax commissioners, ordering them as follows: "Since the reform of the stamp tax last year, the monthly tax revenue has been stipulated to be allocated to local areas to reduce land tax surcharges and eliminate harsh miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, the surplus or deficit of tax revenue greatly affects the central treasury revenue and the allocation to local areas. Recently, after reading the post office reports, since March of this year, the number of stamps sold by post offices in various provinces and cities is mostly smaller than the revenue in the same month last year. The reason for this is undoubtedly due to lax enforcement of inspections. In order to eliminate concealment, increase tax revenue, and maintain the income of the national and local treasuries, inspections and spot checks should be stepped up. In addition to separate telegrams, we hereby request that you check and instruct all inspectors to comply accordingly." It is reported that after receiving the order, the Tax Administration has already distributed it to the supervisory commissioners to step up inspections in various places in order to maintain tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Pan Xulun Lectures on Income Tax, Factories and Shops Should Prepare, Lectures at the Knitting Industry Association Yesterday, Revise Bookkeeping and Register Capital</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Knitting Industry Association has more than 140 member manufacturers. For the purpose of studying the implementation of income tax, an income tax research committee has been organized. Yesterday, a meeting was held at Yizhixiang on Simalu Road, inviting Mr. Pan Xulun, director and accountant of the Lixin Accounting Firm, to give a lecture on "Preparations that Manufacturers Should Urgently Make Before the Implementation of Income Tax." Attendees included Yu Tinghui, chairman of the association, Cai Yinqiao, owner of China First Knitting Factory, Zheng Hairuo, general manager of Xinsheng Manufacturing Factory, Ge Shengru, owner of Qiuzhi Knitting Factory, and dozens of others. Excerpts from Mr. Pan's speech are as follows:</p>
<p>The profit portion of income tax in our country should start being taxed from January 1st next year, which is very soon. All manufacturers should prepare early to avoid being caught off guard. According to the current situation of manufacturers, there are three things that should be prepared immediately:</p>
<p>(1) Improve incomplete bookkeeping and establish accurate bookkeeping. Most knitting factories are sole proprietorships or partnerships, and most are small in scale. Because the managers are mostly shop owners, or closely related to shop owners, they trust each other on weekdays, so they do not pay much attention to bookkeeping, and some even lack records. Now, because income tax must be paid, accurate bookkeeping is necessary to calculate accurate profits and losses and provide reliable evidence. Only then can taxes be paid accordingly to avoid trouble. If there is no accurate bookkeeping, the amount of income can only be estimated. Overestimating will result in paying excessive taxes, while underestimating will result in tax evasion. Moreover, if the manufacturer itself cannot provide accurate accounts to prove the correctness of its income calculation, then the tax officials can legally estimate the amount of tax to be paid, and the taxpayer can only endure it without objection. Therefore, improving bookkeeping is currently the most important task for all factories and shops and should not be delayed any longer. To help all factories improve accounting, the association can organize bookkeeping training classes, inviting factories to send bookkeepers to attend lectures and practice. The teaching should focus on bookkeeping and accounting systems applicable to the industry. In this way, factories can improve bookkeeping without changing personnel in a short period of time.</p>
<p>(2) Quickly estimate the amount of capital and apply for registration or apply for a change of registration. The capital amount of factories and shops that are sole proprietorships or partnerships is not fixed. However, in general, the capital amount recorded on the books of each factory and shop is often very small, while the annual business volume is many times or dozens of times greater than its capital amount. The source of funds is that the owners or partners raise funds on behalf of themselves, or borrow them themselves, without treating them as capital, or save undistributed profits as public accumulation, or withdraw secret public funds every year. Therefore, the capital amount on the books is only a nominal amount without actual substance. If this nominal capital amount is used as the standard for calculating the income ratio, then the factory will suffer unnecessary tax losses, which is unnecessary. Therefore, the first step is for each factory to quickly recalculate its capital amount. All public accumulation and secret public accumulation should be appropriately converted into capital. Even funds that are lent to the business by the shareholders themselves and have a long-term nature should also be converted into capital. In this way, the calculation of the income ratio will be accurate, and paying taxes according to the legal progressive rate will not be disadvantageous. However, the determination of the capital amount should be based on those who have been approved for registration by the competent authorities. In the past, business registration was not widespread. The capital amount was noted on the registration documents and was originally a statistical matter, which was insignificant. Now that the capital amount has become the basis for calculating the tax amount, all factories and shops that have not been approved for registration should immediately apply to the local competent authorities for approval of registration and request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to issue a license. In the event of taxation, the capital amount can be avoided without unnecessary disputes. If it is not registered, the capital of the manufacturer cannot be determined, and the tax collector may need to check his accounts at any time, which will cause a lot of trouble and is not appropriate. As for factories and shops that have already been approved for registration, their capital amount is also often inaccurate and should be recalculated immediately, that is, apply for a registration change of capital. Regarding this point, the report stated that the Ministry of Finance has requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to quickly revise the commercial registration rules and order merchants to comply with them. Therefore, when applying for business registration in the future, the competent authorities will have strict inspections of the capital of the business to prevent abuse of reporting. All businesses must pay attention and apply early. As for domestic industrial and commercial organizations with a corporate structure, most have already been registered, and their capital amount is mostly fixed. However, those who should apply for registration of increased capital should also pay attention to handling it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two points, there are many other matters that factories and shops should pay attention to and study before the implementation of income tax. However, none is as urgent as the above two, so they are specifically mentioned to promote everyone's attention.</p>
<h3>China-Siam Promotes Diplomatic Relations, Establishes China-Siam Association, Chinese Headquarters in Nanjing</h3>
<p>In order to promote diplomatic relations between China and Siam, it is planned to establish a China-Siam Association, located in Bangkok, Siam, and the capital of China. The China-Siam Association in Siam has already nominated candidates and officially established. The Chinese side is also in progress. According to Mr. Lin Kanghou, deputy head of the delegation to Siam, it is said that the China-Siam Association has decided to be established, the Chinese headquarters is in Nanjing, and there are no plans to establish a branch in Shanghai at this time. As for the report on the delegation to Siam, it has been compiled and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and implementation.</p>
<h3>Antiquities Stored in Shanghai, Undetermined Transportation Date to Nanjing, New Warehouse in the Capital, Not Yet Arranged</h3>
<p>The antiquities stored in Shanghai by the Palace Museum were originally scheduled to be transported to Nanjing this month for preservation. However, due to the fact that the new warehouse in the capital has not yet been arranged, it has been slightly delayed. The reporter recently inquired with Mr. Ouyang Banghua, section chief of the Shanghai office of the Palace Museum, who said that the date of transportation of the antiquities stored in Shanghai to Nanjing has not yet been determined. It is rumored that it will be transported in early next month, but the office has not yet received orders. It is currently still being checked. Since the start of this work, more than 10,000 boxes have been completed, and there are currently 3,000 boxes remaining. As soon as the order is received, all the antiquities will be transported to Nanjing for preservation via the Beijing-Shanghai Railway.</p>

<h3>Eurasia Aviation Company, Public Memorial Service for Chen Fengqi Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Fengqi, a trainee sent by Eurasia Aviation Company to the Stettin flying school in Germany last year to learn flying, died in an accident in Germany on the 18th of last month. His coffin arrived in Shanghai from Germany yesterday morning. The company specially held a public memorial service at the Chinese Funeral Home on Haige Road. Company staff and representatives from Lufthansa, Walter, and Junkers Aircraft Factory, Stiel Consul, and many German expatriates paid their respects. Deputy Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications also sent a telegram of condolence. The public memorial service was presided over by Liao Guanxuan, who also delivered a speech, stating that Mr. Chen had been a telegrapher at Eurasia for a long time. When Eurasia Airways opened, he was assigned to serve at the Hami station. Although the area was unstable at the time, he still worked hard. Later, because he was ambitious in the aviation industry, he was sent to Germany by the company for further study, and his achievements were very good. Unfortunately, he died in an accident during flight practice, and the national civil aviation industry has lost a promising talent. It is reported that the cause of the accident is still under investigation. As for his coffin, it was transported to Chang'an Cemetery at noon and will be buried at a later date. Mr. Chen's wife, Zhou Shuzhen, was originally an employee of the International Telegraph Administration and had only been married for a short time. She left behind a child who is still in swaddling clothes.</p>
<h3>Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Holds, Certificate of Silk Weaving Stamped</h3>
<p>In order to assist the government in cracking down on smuggling and to maintain the sales of legitimate goods, the Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association began on the 1st of this month to conduct silk fabric identification, stamping the ends of silk fabrics produced by members to prove their authenticity and facilitate sales. The association's official letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is recorded below:</p>
<p>"To whom it may concern, in order to assist the government in cracking down on smuggling and to maintain the sales of legitimate goods, our association began on October 1st to conduct silk fabric identification for members, stamping the ends of silk fabrics to prove their authenticity. Currently, all products of members, whether old or new, are being stamped at the same time, with the aim of completing all procedures before October 30th, so that from November 1st, all silk fabrics produced by members will have the stamp of our association to prove their authenticity. If silk fabrics are not stamped, they have not undergone identification procedures, and our association will no longer certify them. In this way, for members' products transported to the interior, when encountering anti-smuggling agencies along the way, they can easily identify them at both ends of the silk fabrics, so that legitimate domestic products can have the opportunity to facilitate sales. In addition to submitting two copies of our association's silk fabric identification rules, we hereby submit two copies of the seal used to stamp the ends of silk fabrics for your reference. We kindly request that you forward it to the Ministry of Finance to notify the anti-smuggling agencies in each province and city to verify this seal when inspecting products from Shanghai silk weaving factories, and to release them along with the transportation or distribution license, so as to prove their authenticity and facilitate sales. We respectfully thank you for your public spirit."</p>

<h3>County Land Price Tax, To Be Collected Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>Shanghai County changed from tax in kind to levying land price tax. It was originally scheduled to be collected on the Double Tenth Festival of this month, but because the change was new, all the procedures were quite complicated, so it was postponed. County Chief Li Cha has learned that the first phase of land tax in previous years has already been collected, so he has been supervising the second section and the land tax collection office to rush to build the string book. It is heard that the cabinet can be set up and started at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Russia and Nanyang, Return to China One After Another</h3>
<p>Miserable situation, find ways to send them back</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau's announcement yesterday morning, two overseas Chinese from Russia returned to China yesterday due to old age and unemployment, and four overseas Chinese from Japan were also deported to Shanghai. An overseas Chinese from the Philippines returned to China in poverty. All have been sent back to their places of origin by the association. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In Russia</p>
<p>Two more overseas Chinese residing in Vladivostok, Soviet Union, who were deported back to China by the Soviet authorities due to old age and unemployment, arrived in Shanghai on the Russian ship North. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sent personnel to inquire about their situation and extracted their names, ages, and places of origin as follows: (1) Tao Xingxi, 56 years old, from Penglai County, Shandong Province, has lived in Vladivostok for 25 years; (2) Fang Xishan, 67 years old, from Laiyang County, Donglai, has lived in Vladivostok for 32 years.

The above overseas Chinese have been separated by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau according to their places of origin and have been helped to obtain ship tickets to send them back to their original places of origin.</p>
<h3>Chen Guirong's Ear Injury Case</h3>
<p>Intended to Steal, Twisted His Left Ear</p>
<p>According to a report in the Chinese-American Evening Post on the 17th of this month, a man from Nanxun named Chen Guirong was stabbed in the left ear by Japanese soldiers. Some people have distributed leaflets to express their indignation. In order to clarify the truth of the case, the reporter has made many inquiries. The results of the investigation by the Public Concession and the Public Security Bureau reveal that the reason for the injury to Chen Guirong's ear was that the man sneaked into a house in Zhabei with the intention of stealing. Unexpectedly, he was discovered and captured by the owner of the house. In the struggle, his ear was twisted. He then went to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Fearing that the truth about the injury would be revealed to the hospital, he would be detained and fined by the police, so he fabricated a story to avoid punishment. The hospital then reported the information to the police station, resulting in a miscommunication. After investigation, it was all fiction, and it was found that the man was a habitual offender, and stealing was not the first time. His arm was tattooed with criminal marks.</p>
<h3>Frequent Japanese Warship Traffic</h3>
<p>Three Japanese warships entered the port yesterday and two departed. After the number of Japanese warships was reduced to three at one time, they have recently become active again, and their whereabouts are very erratic. Yesterday morning, it was counted that the cruiser Shimakaye and the destroyers Jintsu and Nagora arrived in Shanghai. At 9:40, the cruisers NagotsukFunitsuk departed at the same time. These ships enter and leave the Wusong Estuary very frequently, and their intentions are unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Formulates Penalties for Mineral Products</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance yesterday issued instructions to all tax bureaus and tax management offices regarding the handling of violations of mineral products: "After investigating violations of mineral products, regarding the review method, the most recent announcement, the temporary regulations on the review of violations by each district tax bureau and each sub-district tax management office, can be used as a basis. As for the rules on punishment, before the regulations on the punishment of mineral products are formulated, those who seriously conceal tax evasion may be punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 116 of the Mining Law, in addition to tax supplementation, a fine of more than one time to five times the amount of tax payable shall be imposed. Those with minor circumstances, or non-compliance with procedures, or unreported inspection, and no tax evasion, should be handled in accordance with the punishment regulations of other unified taxes. The amount of punishment shall not exceed twice the amount of tax payable (abbreviated below)."</p>
<h3>Yeh Fu-kang Accused: The Facts Are Entirely Fabricated</h3>
<p>Four Lawyers' Statement: Lawyers Ren Wei, Cai Ding, Gu Ao, and Shen Zengkuan state: In May of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Wang Hanqing commissioned us lawyers to act on his behalf in filing a private prosecution with the Shanghai First Special District Court against Yeh Fu-kang for financial fraud. Yeh Fu-kang went to the lawyers' office and invited Wang Hanqing to explain the matter in person, and a petition was submitted requesting permission to withdraw the private prosecution. Recently, we have read in various Shanghai newspapers that Yeh Fu-kang incited theft of gold bars and seduced Wang Hanqing's wife, and that Wang Hanqing was sentenced to one year and six months in prison, with the case delayed for two or three years due to appeals. Yeh, taking advantage of Wang's wife's youth, seduced her into adultery, and so on. Upon investigation, the case against the person involved, Wang Hanxiang, previously prosecuted by the Hongkou police, was declared not guilty by the Shanghai First Special District Court in a criminal judgment on May 28th of the 20th year of the Republic of China. As for the private prosecution case, Wang Hanqing was not involved in the theft of gold bars, and Yeh Fu-kang did not incite the theft of gold bars. Wang Hanqing was never sentenced to one year and six months in prison and detained for two or three years, and Yeh Fu-kang did not take advantage of the opportunity to seduce Wang's wife. The original case file is available for review. The reports in the newspapers are inevitably inaccurate due to hearsay. We are deeply concerned that this will confuse public opinion, and we hereby issue this statement on October 26th of the 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Yeh Fu-kang's Letter: To the Editor, Your newspaper published a news item on the 25th of this month concerning accusations against me. Not only is it completely inconsistent with the facts, but it is also full of malicious libel and defamation. My former lawyer representing Wang Hanqing, Gu Ao, Cha Renwei, Cai Ding, Shen Zengkuan, and others, have issued a statement in today's Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers clarifying everything. Now, I select the most outrageous fabricated facts and list them as follows: 1. In the Republic of China's year of X, Wang Hanqing was arrested for theft and appointed me for defense. He was declared not guilty in the initial trial. In the Republic of China's year of X+2, Wang Hanqing falsely accused me of defrauding him of public funds, but later, realizing his case was unfounded and fearing false accusation, he withdrew the private prosecution, as certified by lawyers Gu Ao, Cha Renwei, Cai Ding, Shen Zengkuan, and others. This can be verified in case file number 704 of the First Special District Court of the Republic of China's year of X+1. 2. Wang Hanqing's theft case and private prosecution case do not involve any gold bars (all can be verified in court files). However, someone has fabricated shocking rumors about inciting the theft of gold bars and sharing the gold bars. 3. Wang Hanqing's theft case resulted in an acquittal in the initial trial, and he returned to Hankou with Wang Zhangshi. How could there be a sentence of one year and six months in prison, and how could there be an opportunity to seduce an old woman nearing fifty with a cormorant-like face by delaying detention through appeals? (All of this can be verified in court files.) 4. The "Little Luzon Hat Shop" was acquired in the Republic of China's year of X-1 (there is a transfer certificate from the Spanish consulate that can be verified). Wang Hanqing appointed me as his defense attorney around May or June of the Republic of China's year of X. However, it is falsely claimed that I defrauded him of funds to open the shop. Other fabrications, such as the Ministry of Justice sending personnel and various judicial absurdities, are nothing more than shocking and outrageous statements for other purposes. Because the case is under investigation, I must maintain confidentiality, and I, Fu-kang, do not want to say more. However, Wang Hanqing believes I am weak and can be bullied, and has spoken such nonsense. Even a just newspaper like yours has been misled, causing society to laugh and relatives and friends to be horrified. I have no choice but to state the facts and respectfully request a correction. To the Shen Bao Newspaper, Yeh Fu-kang.</p>
<h3>Attention: Road Traffic Safety</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works Ordered to Forward Instructions to Transportation Companies, etc., for Information.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Commission, considering that the intersection of railroads and highways is most prone to danger, has resolved three measures for the sake of safety: (1) Request the Ministry of Railways to install barriers at intersections of railways and highways where barriers have not yet been installed. (2) Send letters to provinces and cities to erect train warning signs on highways. (3) Send letters to provinces and cities instructing highway traffic authorities to order vehicles or livestock crossing railroads without barriers to proceed according to the following steps, regardless of whether a train is approaching: (A) Stop at a safe distance from the railroad. (B) Look clearly along the railroad in both directions for trains. (C) Listen for the sound of approaching trains. (D) If a train is seen or heard approaching, wait at the original stopping point until the train has passed before crossing. (E) Only cross if no train is approaching. It is now learned that the establishment of barriers and traffic signs has been requested by the Secretariat of the National Economic Commission to the Ministry of Railways and the competent authorities of various provinces and cities. The Shanghai Municipal Government has approved the Secretariat's letter regarding the third measure and has instructed the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to forward it to the city's long-distance bus companies, taxi trade associations, freight truck trade associations, and automobile firms for information.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Translation Corps Shooting Monthly Competition Record</h3>
<p>Xia Zaiyu's Score is Not Bad</p>
<p>The monthly live-fire shooting competition of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Translation Corps has always been held jointly with the Chinese Team. It is understood that the eighth and ninth month shooting was held separately due to fears of overcrowding. In addition to the Chinese Team holding the competition in the first ten days of the month, members of the Translation Corps completed the supplementary shooting at the Hongkou shooting range yesterday morning. The competition consisted of five shots each of two- and three-hundred-yard prone slow-fire rifle on small targets, and ten shots of three-hundred-yard standing rapid-fire rifle from within a trench. The results of the competition show that Xia Zaiyu of the Special Class achieved the best score. The names and scores of the champions in each class are recorded as follows: August, Special Class, Xia Zaiyu scored 48 points, Class A Hu Kaifu 42 points, Class B Xu Baomin 46 points, Class C Cao Zhiming 36 points, Class D Mu Zhikun 39 points, New Recruit Xu Zuda 41 points.

<h3>Founders of the Southern Anhui News, Tang Ren'an, and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Tang Ren'an and Wu Juxian, the initiators of the Southern Anhui News, believe that Tunxi is the commercial transportation center of Anhui, and cultural undertakings are still lacking. After several months of effort, they established the Southern Anhui Newspaper in Tunxi, raised sufficient capital, and first established a preparatory office. The temporary shareholders' meeting resolved to specifically delegate Tang and Wu to come to Shanghai first to select and purchase machinery and other items. It is reported that the inaugural issue of the newspaper is scheduled to be published on New Year's Day next year. Chairman Feng Jiansheng will also come to Shanghai within days to handle everything and plans to contact fellow villagers in Shanghai to discuss expanding the plan.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Bao Gang Accused of Seduction Case Involves the Chief of Chuansha District Office. Supervisory Department Sends Personnel to Court to Interrogate Zhang Qinghong. The Case is Serious, Bao Gang Posts an Additional 3,000 Yuan Bail.</h3>
<p>Lawyer Bao Gang has been accused by Cui Changgui, a chauffeur from the Special Affairs Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and his fiancée Yang Yuehua. Although Yang Yuehua and Cui Changgui are not married, they have been living together. After a quarrel, Zhang Xingu, a servant from Bao Gang's office, took her to Bao's office and incited her to divorce. She was then defiled by Bao at the Dafang Hotel. When Cui reported the matter to the Detective Team, Bao hid Yang Yuehua in the countryside of Pudong. They requested an investigation. Prosecutor Kong of the District Court has filed a public prosecution against Bao and Zhang Xingu for the crime of</p>
<p>hindering family happiness</p>
<p>After repeated examinations, Bao claimed it was a conspiracy to extort money. Yesterday morning, Judge Xie Zhengnong opened the Fourth Criminal Court for trial. According to Cui Changgui's testimony, he is 27 years old, from Shandong, and became engaged to Yang Yuehua on February 14th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. They had not married because his mother died. They began living together on July 17th of the 23rd year. He used to live in the same lane as Bao Gang, Bao lived at number 4, and he lived at number 9. On the morning of May 10th of this year, he quarreled with his wife, and friends advised them to separate. He did not know that his wife had gone out or about Bao Gang and others. He reported to the bureau after his wife had not returned since May 17th and he</p>
<p>could not find her anywhere</p>
<p>Later, a friend told him she was in Pudong. He went and found his wife, but Bao Gang was not there. As for the witness Zhou Mingxuan, a tea server at the Dafang Hotel, he testified, "I have never seen Yang Yuehua, nor do I recognize her. As for who came to open the room, I don't remember clearly." Then, the witness Zhang Qinghong, the chief of the Third District of Chuansha County, testified that he did not know Bao Gang, nor had Yang Yuehua ever been to his office. The judge ordered Zhang to sit in the audience, and ordered Yang Yuehua to testify in court. Yang Yuehua claimed that when Bao Gang took her to the countryside, she had been to the Third District Office of Chuansha, which was located at</p>
<p>Gongjia Road Intersection</p>
<p>and met the District Chief Zhang Qinghong. The judge said, "Then if you saw the District Chief, you must recognize him." She replied, "I recognize him." The judge ordered her to look closely among the audience to see if he was there. Yang Yuehua pointed out Zhang Qinghong. The judge immediately questioned him why he claimed he had never seen her. Zhang replied, "As the Chief of the Third District, there are 100,000 people in that area. How could anyone not recognize me?" By this time, it was almost noon. The presiding judge then declared that the case was being investigated by the Supervisory Committee on the orders of the President of the Court, and the situation was relatively serious. Bao Gang should post an additional 3,000 yuan in bail, and Zhang Xingu should post an additional 1,000 yuan in bail. All</p>
<p>witnesses and evidence</p>
<p>should be brought to the court at 1:30 PM for further questioning and to await the investigator from the Supervisory Committee. The court was then adjourned. In the afternoon, after all the witnesses arrived, Wu Zhang (Zi Zhuochen, from Hunan), the secretary and chief of the General Affairs Section dispatched by the Jiangsu Supervisory District Commissioner's Office, opened the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Initially, after Bao Gang was accused, the Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau arrested Bao's wife, but she was released after being sent to the District Court. Bao's wife then accused the former Detective Team Leader Zhang Datong and others of dereliction of duty at the Supervisory Yuan. The Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office issued an order to investigate. When the committee member came to Shanghai, he first went to the Public Security Bureau to investigate. The Public Security Bureau informed him that Zhang Datong had already been</p>
<p>dismissed from his post</p>
<p>However, the bureau's opinion was that Zhang Qinghong, the Chief of the Third District of Chuansha County, was also guilty of hiding the seduced person on behalf of Bao Gang. Therefore, the bureau accused Zhang of illegality and requested a joint investigation. Therefore, after the supervisory committee member arrived at the court, he first focused on Zhang Qinghong's matter. After the hearing began, he first questioned Cui Changgui and Yang Yuehua, whose testimonies were the same as before. Yang Yuehua also claimed that she had lived in Zhang Qinghong's house for many days and had taken photos with Zhang's concubine. Then Cui Changgui was asked, "You said that when Bao Gang abducted Yang Yuehua, he took 360 yuan. Do you</p>
<p>have any evidence to the contrary</p>
<p>He replied, "Yes, I won the lottery and borrowed money from Director Liu, both of whom can testify." Then, he asked Yang Yuehua, "Have you gotten the property back?" She replied, "I only got back a watch and a ring, the rest I haven't gotten back." Then, he questioned Zhang Qinghong, 32 years old, from Chuansha, a graduate of Pudong Middle School, who has been the Chief of the Third District of Chuansha County since he was 25 years old. He is very strict with himself and has no relationship with either party. He asked, "Do you often come to Shanghai?" He replied, "Once or twice a month, to purchase things for the office in Shanghai." He asked, "Do you know about Bao Gang's matter?" He replied, "I don't know." The supervisory committee member then stated, "I came here because Bao Gang's wife</p>
<p>went to the Supervisory Yuan</p>
<p>to accuse the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau of dereliction of duty, indiscriminately detaining and torturing innocent people. You are a district chief and a person who knows the law. Why did you hide the criminal? You should explain the whole situation." He replied, "Yang Yuehua has never been to my office." He asked, "Bao Gang is your fellow villager and good friend. He is taking a concubine. He stayed at your house for two days. You don't know the situation? It is also common courtesy. You should know that if you knowingly concealed it, you are a civil servant and not only violated the criminal law, the Supervisory Yuan should also impeach you." He replied, "I request that the superiors investigate in Chuansha County. If I have indeed concealed the fugitive Yang Yuehua, I am willing to receive the most</p>
<p>severe punishment</p>
<p>He asked, "I have never been to Chuansha. How is your character? I don't know. But can the County Chief of Chuansha County and the chiefs of the other districts in the county guarantee that you would never do this?" He replied, "Yes, they can." He asked, "Can you ask your county chief to investigate?" He replied, "I don't have this authority. I can make a written statement and ask the Supervisory Yuan to send a letter to the County Chief to investigate." At this point, Yang Yuehua interjected, "On July 19th, I went to the District Office with Bao Gang. The District Chief was not at home at that time. The tea server received us. After a while, the District Chief came back. Bao Gang introduced us and asked me to call him Mr. Zhang. Later, I stayed at his</p>
<p>second wife's place</p>
<p>for more than a month. I took a photo with his second wife. I was dressed as a man in the photo. The photo is in the clip." Zhang Qinghong immediately refuted, "Absolutely not. I only have one wife, surnamed Yao." He said that Chuansha County has a Baojia system, and an investigation can easily clarify the matter. The presiding judge said, "There is no need to argue. This is easy to investigate. However, you are the District Chief. Did this happen or not? If you deceive me, you are deceiving the Supervisory Yuan. Deceiving the Yuan is deceiving our party, and deceiving the party is being a reactionary." Zhang replied, "Since my student days, I have dedicated myself to the party. I am wholeheartedly working for the party. I would never deceive the party. Please investigate thoroughly." At this point, Yang Yuehua again</p>
<p>attacked</p>
<p>Zhang Qinghong, saying that he graduated from Chi-chih University in Jiangwan and was a classmate of Bao Gang. But Zhang denied it. At this point, Bao Gang still denied the matter with Yang Yuehua, insisting that he was being framed. The judge then said, "I also hope that this didn't happen. If this happened, it would be very painful. Lawyers are supposed to protect human rights. Now, if a lawyer has done this, it would be a laughingstock both domestically and internationally. It would be unthinkable." Then he asked Bao's tea server, Zhang Xingu, who replied, "I have been a tea server for ten months, and I have also been framed." At this point, the supervisory committee member said, "Bao Gang's case is being judged by the court. What I am reviewing is the public official, District Chief Zhang Qinghong, and Zhang Datong and others. So now I will take this</p>
<p>copy of the record</p>
<p>back to discuss what crime Zhang Qinghong has committed and what crime Zhang Datong has committed." At this point, Cui Changgui made a written statement, "If Yang Yuehua is not found at the District Chief's house, I am willing to accept whatever punishment." At this point, the judge ordered Zhang Qinghong to also make a statement that if Bao Gang and Yang Yuehua were hiding in his house, he was also willing to be punished. At this point, the supervisory committee member had finished questioning everyone. He then asked Judge Xie to return to court to continue questioning the original case of hindering family happiness. Judge Xie then took out Zhang Qinghong's four-inch</p>
<p>photo</p>
<p>and asked, "Is this your photo?" He replied, "Yes." He asked, "Why did it fall into Yang Yuehua's hands?" He replied, "I don't know." The judge then showed a double photo, instructing the photo with a man dressed as Yang Yuehua, and a woman dressed up. The judge then asked, according to Yang Yuehua, the woman is your concubine, he replied, "I do not have a concubine, I only have one wife, Yao, who is 31 years old and can be brought in." At this point, the judge announced that the case would be adjourned for further questioning. The defendant Bao Gang was fined an additional 1,000 yuan bail, which was posted by Wang Zechang from Wang Shunxing Wood Shop at 743 Min'guo Road, Laobeimen. Zhang Xingu was taken into custody without bail. Court adjourned after 7 p.m.</p>
<h3>China Health Society Established Yesterday, Popularizing Public Medical Security, Promoting Preventive Healthcare</h3>
<p>The China Health Society, which has been in preparation for years, is the latest medical service organization of the Municipal United People's Physicians Hospital. Years ago, Dr. Ding Huikang, the director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium, was ordered by the Ministry to go abroad to study and had a cooperative agreement with the Navo Company of Hamburg, Germany, the largest social insurance organization in Germany. After returning to China, he actively advocated for in-depth discussions with domestic experts and received support from former Mayor Zhang Dingfan and other parties. Preparations were completed, and the society was officially established yesterday, commencing services. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Benefiting the Poor</p>
<p>The society is specifically for the general poor people. Due to the decline of the social economy, it is difficult for the general public to afford medical treatment. This situation has worsened in recent years, which affects not only personal happiness and hinders social construction, but also seriously damages the foundation of national health and revival. In view of this, the society aims to enable anyone to solve all medical problems with a small number of limited community fees and obtain the most effective health protection. Li Chao stated that the society's work is the foundation of national defense.</p>
<p>Centralized Medical Care</p>
<p>Our country has never had a health organization that brings together the public's doctors and hospitals. The Society is adapting to the needs of society, centralizing all of the latest medical equipment from the modern world, establishing a large-scale medical service organization, popularizing public medical security, and promoting preventive healthcare.</p>
<p>Contracted Doctors</p>
<p>The Society has contracted specialist doctors from all departments to serve members on a regular basis. The specialists in each department are Dr. Ding Huikang, Director of Cardiology; Dr. Wang Yihui, Director of Gynecology and Obstetrics; Dr. Gu Honglie, Director of Radiology; Dr. Yi Hou, Director of Pediatrics; Dr. Jiang Junsun, Director of Infectious Diseases; Dr. Li Zubai, Director of Gastroenterology; Dr. Sun Kejin, Director of Dermatology; Dr. Dong Bingqi, Director of Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Reproductive Urology; Dr. Lin Shixi, Director of Ophthalmology, Otolaryngology; Dr. Qu Songshou, Director of Laboratory; Dr. Tang Jingheng, Resident Director. In addition, famous doctors from various departments are specially contracted for joint collaboration. In addition to the Hongqiao Sanatorium and its branches, which initiated the Society and provide all medical equipment, the entire city's hospitals are specifically used for joint collaboration to meet the needs of patients.</p>
<p>Free Rights</p>
<p>The Society divides members into three types, A, B, C, and D, as well as affiliated members, according to the social and economic situation, so that each can pay community fees economically according to their personal circumstances. Once a member joins the society, they are entitled to various medical benefits in accordance with the regulations. On average, a daily fee of 1.6 cents entitles them to free consultations throughout the year. A daily community fee of 3 cents entitles them to free hospitalization and all medical expenses. Therefore, once a member joins the society, the problem of medical treatment is completely resolved.</p>
<p>Preventive Work</p>
<p>Modern medicine is advancing rapidly. In the passive aspect, emphasis is placed on treatment, while in the active aspect, attention is paid to preventing diseases. The society plans to implement examinations for tuberculosis, cancer, venereal diseases, trachoma, and free health checkups to promote preventive medicine and enable the public to achieve true health protection. Staff members will visit members' daily lives and hygiene methods at any time and provide detailed guidance to improve family health and happiness.</p>
<p>Suburban Entertainment</p>
<p>In order to improve the health of members and adjust their lives, the Society has selected scenic suburban areas with convenient transportation and established suburban clubs. It also provides buses and all legitimate entertainment facilities such as tennis courts and boating, and can also provide social accommodation at the lowest price, improving health in entertainment.</p>
<p>Ten-Year Plan</p>
<p>The health care business is still in its infancy in our country. The Society has a ten-year plan. In the first year, the society will make the public aware of the truth of health care and service conditions as a period of awareness. In the second and third years, the society will do its best to serve with the public's awareness and a solid foundation as a service period. After the third year, it will strive for development so that national health care can achieve great results as a promotion period. From the fifth to the tenth year, it hopes that all localities will respond and set up more branch offices as a period of popularity, which is also the period of success for China's health care business.</p>
<p>Supervisory Titles</p>
<p>The Society has received enthusiastic support from leaders from all walks of life. The supervisors are Li Dachao, Pan Gongzhan, Li Ting'an, Yan Fuqing, and Lu Bohong. The directors are Ye Gongchuo, Zhang Dingfan, Zhou Yongneng, Feng Bingnan, Zhu Shaoping, Jiang Wenyu, Weng Zhilong, Zhu Boquan, Cai Chengxin, Du Chongyuan, Wang Boqi, Ma Yinliang, Zheng Yaonan, Ding Fubao, and Ding Huikang.</p>
<p>Head Office</p>
<p>The Society has set up its head office at No. A2, South West Road, Jing'an Temple, Shanghai. The transportation is very convenient. Detailed articles can be obtained by sending a request to the address.</p>
<h3>National Products Movement Issues Announcement, Promoting Family Visitation Work, Purchasing 260,000,000 Yuan of Foreign Goods in the Last Four Years, Hoping that Housewives in Charge of Domestic Affairs Will Actively Promote</h3>
<p>The Municipal National Products Movement Federation issued an announcement yesterday to promote family visitation work, stating that the Federation is now sincerely offering some advice to your wife and ladies of your household, because we see that the national crisis is extremely serious, on the one hand due to enemy oppression, and on the other hand due to the annual outflow of money. Do you know that from the 21st to the 24th year of the Republic of China, in these four years, the money that flowed to foreign countries due to everyone's purchase of foreign goods in China reached a huge sum of 260 million yuan. The customs statistics are very clear. If we do not wake up again, we do not need to fight a war, and the country will be destroyed soon. "Country," "Country," without a country, where is the home? Therefore, we are using some patriotic blood to promote national products, starting from the family. We also see that women are really the backbone of a family. There is nothing in the family that is not under the control of the housewife. For example, clothing, food, and small items, which of the daily necessities of a family does not have to go through the housewife's selection? Therefore, your wife's duty to promote national products and the responsibility to save the country are heavy burdens that are incumbent on a national standpoint. Based on this view, the Federation wants to help each family unite to promote national products in unison. After several meetings and careful discussions, we have invited five visitors, who are all well-educated and enthusiastic patriotic ladies. At the same time, we have also received enthusiastic support from various factories, who have given many preferential tickets, samples, and samples to reward the housewives who love to use national products, to report to your wise wife and the ladies of your household the recent improvements and progress of national products, and how to identify the authenticity of national products. We hope that your wife and ladies will deeply understand the meaning of the visit and talk at home, but sometimes when your wife is busy with household affairs, please forgive us, then your wife may wish to choose a free time, and the visitor will sincerely go forward to ask for advice. This is something that the Federation wants to ask your wife to forgive us and cooperate with us. Wishing you good health, Shanghai National Products Movement Federation.</p>
<h3>New Residents of Each Civilian Village in the City Please Register</h3>
<p>The four new civilian villages built by the Municipal Civilian Welfare Undertakings Management Committee were completed at the end of last year. After inviting people from all walks of life to visit on January 16th of this year, citizens of this city enthusiastically applied for registration. They were filled within a month. At the end of last month, due to the current situation, more than thirty families from Qimei Road Village moved to the concession, and more than ten families from the Zhongshan Road and Pushan Road villages moved out. Recently, with the situation improving, in addition to some of the old households returning, there are twenty or thirty new households applying for registration every day. It is said that because the rent and miscellaneous expenses of each village are only four or five yuan a month, it is actually cheaper than any other houses. There are flower gardens, sports fields, and reading rooms in the villages. Villagers can exercise freely or read books and newspapers. Each also has a primary school and kindergarten, and the children of villagers can attend school for free. Therefore, they are all regarded as civilian paradises in the city.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Training: Nursing and Anti-Gas Personnel</h3>
<p>Graduation to Include First Aid Demonstration</p>
<p>The nursing and anti-gas classes established by the First Aid Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Xin Zha Road in Shanghai have already begun. The nursing class is taught by Ms. Tong Qingmin and has over fifty students. The anti-gas class is taught by Dr. Zheng Lanhua and has over seventy students. A reporter from Datong News Agency visited Mr. Shen Jin, head of the compilation and publicity section of the association, yesterday. According to him, both classes will be completed next month and a public demonstration of first aid and anti-gas techniques is planned. All graduating students will receive graduation certificates.</p>
<h3>A Grand Wedding at the Lu Residence</h3>
<p>Lu Liankui, a prominent figure in Shanghai, celebrated the wedding of his eldest son, Jiajun, to Ms. Qi Liyun at the Central Hotel yesterday (the 27th).

<h3>Municipal Federation Urges City Government to Ban Disguised Escort Services Publicly Soliciting Business with Obscene Language, Leading Weak-Willed Youths Astray</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai has submitted a petition to the Municipal Government to ban disguised escort services. The original petition states: "Regarding the matter of petitioning for the banning of disguised escort services. The establishment of escort services in cities is not inherently wrong. Merchants from afar, unfamiliar with the local area, often lack knowledge of market conditions or tourist attractions. Having an escort service to guide them is convenient. Therefore, most major cities worldwide have escort services to serve the needs of merchants and travelers. The existence of escort services in Shanghai is a relatively recent phenomenon. However, due to their unscrupulous pursuit of profit, they have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain. It is estimated that no less than a hundred have been established one after another. Upon examination, they not only lack any value in serving society but also employ absurd measures that harm society. Recently, they have even published advertisements openly soliciting business with obscene language, leading many weak-willed youths astray, unable to extricate themselves. We believe that the youth are the pillars of the nation. At this time of national crisis, it is precisely when the youth should strive to repay the country. However, these disguised escort services use young women as bait, enticing in every possible way, destroying the minds and bodies of the youth, eroding their ambition, and misleading them more than anything else. The nation and the people are suffering from adverse effects. Therefore, after deliberation by the 12th Executive Committee of this Federation, we petition the government to ban disguised escort services in order to purify public morals and safeguard the foundation of the nation. Furthermore, for escort services with pure purposes, we also request that regulations be promulgated and registration be conducted. The qualifications of the guides should be strictly scrutinized to impose limitations, so that unscrupulous elements cannot take advantage. We hereby respectfully submit this petition for review and implementation. We pray for your consideration."</p>
<h3>Flower Arrangement Society Holds Autumn Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flower Arrangement Society has scheduled its autumn exhibition to be held on November 15th and 16th at the Shanghai Race Club. Those wishing to enter bonsai can deliver them to the society on November 12th and 13th. Those wishing to enter flower arrangements and vegetables should deliver them on the 15th. The deadline for submissions is 10:30 AM on that day. No entries will be accepted on the 14th.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Announces Overview of Reorganization Efforts Salary Reduction of 10,400 Yuan After Layoffs Freight and Passenger Revenue Increases by Over 718,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Following the Ministry of Transportation's order for reorganization, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, under the leadership of General Manager Cai Zengji, Deputy General Managers Tan Boying and Lao Mian, has been resolutely working on reforms. Although the time has been short, significant progress has been made in organization, personnel, shipping, etc. The company has now released an overview of the reorganization efforts, which is reproduced below:</p>
<p>Internal Structure</p>
<p>Before the reorganization, the internal organization of the company, in addition to the General Manager's Office, included the Supervisory Committee and the Board of Directors. All important administrative matters had to be decided by the two committees before being implemented by the General Manager's Office. In February of this year, following the reorganization order, the Supervisory Committee and the Board of Directors were abolished. In addition to retaining the General Manager's Office, two Deputy General Managers were added. The organization names and responsibilities of the internal departments, sections, and warehouses have been slightly modified. After the reorganization, the procedures for each department, section, and warehouse to handle matters were re-established based on actual circumstances, with appropriate additions and mergers. To improve efficiency, the procedures for each department, section, and warehouse were designed to have mutual connections and checks. In particular, the regulations between the warehouse and the accounting office were made especially detailed. All receipts and payments must be mutually verified against the accounting office's books. These detailed rules have been drafted and submitted to the Ministry for review.</p>
<p>Layoffs and Salary Reductions</p>
<p>During the five years from 1928 to 1932, the average number of internal employees of the company was over 194. The highest number was 279 in the spring of 1932, with monthly salaries totaling over 33,700 yuan. By the winter of 1932, the number of employees had been reduced to 234, with salaries totaling over 26,880 yuan, already a decrease from before. After the reorganization this year, as a result of efforts to streamline operations, the number of employees has been reduced to 125, with salaries totaling over 16,480 yuan, a reduction of 109 employees and a monthly salary reduction of 10,400 yuan compared to before the reorganization.</p>
<p>Passenger Revenue Increase</p>
<p>Before the reorganization, all river steamers of the company adopted a contracted quota system. The business of each vessel was managed entirely by the business director (i.e., the comprador). There were no restrictions on the sale of passenger tickets, and undisciplined soldiers and riffraff mixed among the passengers, smoking, gambling, and creating chaos. With such disorder, hygiene was out of the question. Therefore, the treatment of passengers in the steerage was almost inhuman. In particular, the number of tea servers on each ship was often around a hundred. They received no wages and had to pay a large deposit. They would then demand tips for berths and extort wine money. The petty expenses often exceeded the ticket price by one or two times. Openly soliciting, travelers regarded river steamers with fear, and business declined as a result. After the reorganization, the comprador system was resolutely abolished on April 1. Tickets are now sold at counters at the dock and passengers board the ship with tickets, which are allocated to designated cabins. This prevents riffraff from mixing in. The tea servers were renamed "service attendants" and their wages and wine money were fixed. All bad habits were eliminated. The New Life Movement Promotion Association dispatched members to the ships to guide hygiene and other matters. The company also formed another inspection team to conduct inspections on the ships. Since implementation, travelers have found it convenient and passenger revenue has increased significantly. From the abolition of the comprador system and the adoption of the "actual reporting and actual reimbursement" system in April of this year to the end of July, after deducting business expenses, there was a surplus of over 155,525 yuan, an increase of more than 21,025 yuan compared to the contracted quota during the same period in 1935, accounting for 15.66% of the contracted quota.</p>
<p>Ship Repair</p>
<p>Ship repair costs have been extremely high annually. Before the reorganization, the repair of each ship took 60 to 70 days, or at least a month. After the repairs were completed, the ship's crew would inspect and accept the work themselves. This not only led to incomplete and dishonest work on the project, but also caused a long period of suspension, resulting in significant losses in business. Therefore, after the reorganization, when a ship needs to be repaired, the company's engineers inspect and survey the ship and submit a report to the company for approval before soliciting bids for the repairs. Engineers are then assigned to the ship to supervise the repairs and submit a supervisory report. The repairs for each ship now take only eight or nine days, or a maximum of 13 or 14 days. In total, the repair costs for all ships under the company from February to August of this year were only over 231,750 yuan, a decrease of 108,378 yuan compared to the amount spent from February to August of 1935.</p>
<p>Material Consumption</p>
<p>Without restrictions, waste is inevitable. Therefore, after the reorganization, the quantity of materials required for each ship each month was specified based on the size of the ship and reserved in advance. Public bids are solicited every three months. To the extent possible, domestic goods are used as the standard. For items needed temporarily, if the estimated value is more than 100 yuan, bids must also be solicited before purchasing. The consumption of each ship is also secretly inspected at any time to ensure that funds are not wasted and materials are not wasted. In total, the materials used by each ship from February to August of this year amounted to 87,120 yuan, a decrease of more than 66,523 yuan compared to the amount for the same seven-month period in 1935 before the reorganization.</p>
<p>Ship Fuel</p>
<p>Fuel is a major expense for the company. The long-standing malpractices in the past cannot be denied. There have been reforms in previous years. After the reorganization, the procedures for requisitioning coal were strictly regulated, and the use of coal was secretly inspected on the ships. From February to June of this year, the ships traveled 350,792 nautical miles, using 42,069 tons of coal, an average of 0.1192 tons of coal per nautical mile. Compared to the amount of coal used per nautical mile before the reorganization (0.1312 tons), there was a reduction of 0.0120 tons of coal per mile. If the average amount of coal used per mile before the reorganization is multiplied by the total nautical miles traveled in the five months of this year, then 3,955 tons of coal should have been saved, which, at a price of 11 yuan and 15 cents per ton, amounts to a total savings of over 43,998 yuan.</p>
<p>Labor Bidding</p>
<p>The company's Shanghai docks are divided into five wharves: South, North, Central, New, and Hua. The annual expenses for cargo handling labor amount to over 300,000 yuan. In the past, a contracted system was adopted, resulting in significant losses each year. After the reorganization, the Ministry of Transportation ordered the abolition of the old system and the adoption of public bidding. Public bidding was held on several occasions, with the Director of the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau sent by the Ministry to supervise the process. A Bid Review Meeting was also formed to review the bidders' experience and the prices they bid to determine the winners. The bidder with the lowest bid and the most experience was selected as the winner and the runner-up for each wharf. The process has now been completed. Although the prices bid for each wharf are not the same, the average is 67.1%. Based on the actual labor expenses for 1935, over 114,700 yuan can be saved each year. If business develops in the future and cargo volume increases, the savings will be even greater.</p>
<p>Business Comparison</p>
<p>The company's river and sea steamer revenue is mainly from passenger and freight fares. In the past, due to various reasons, business was declining. After the reorganization, efforts were made to rectify the situation, and business gradually began to thrive. From February to July of this year, both passenger and freight transportation increased, with an average increase of about 17% compared to the same period last year. In particular, passenger and freight transportation increased sharply in August.

In total, the freight and passenger revenue for the seven months from January to August of this year amounted to over 4,271,170 yuan, an increase of over 718,546 yuan compared to the freight and passenger revenue for the same period in 1935.</p>
<h3>Tensions High Between Two Factions Fruit Workers Engage in Armed Fight Workers Express Dissatisfaction with Foremen's Oppression Long-Standing Feud Between New and Old Factions Erupts Recently</h3>
<p>The area around Beisuzhou Road and Touba Road is a gathering place for various fruit businesses. After the fruit boats from the inland areas dock at the piers there, the unloading of the fruit has been handled by workers who specialize in this trade. In recent years, these workers have mostly felt that their foreman, Li Shibaobao, a Cantonese, often oppresses the workers and deprives them of their wages, so they are very dissatisfied. They have discussed uniting to cope with the situation. Therefore, on June 15th of this year, the Shanghai Fourth District Civilian Boat Shoulder-Carrying Industry Workers' Union was organized. The first step was to gather willpower, and then to seek liberation. Li also knew the workers'</p>
<p>intentions</p>
<p>So he decided to start gradually eliminating those who disagreed with him. Therefore, he recruited 70 new workers from his hometown to join the work and used this to increase his strength. From then on, the workers in this industry formed new and old factions, which became increasingly hostile. The old faction planned that once Li was overthrown, they would support Xu Jintang, a standing committee member of the union, to become the leader. Therefore, the secret struggles between the two sides were very fierce. Until recently, the simmering tension was about to</p>
<p>erupt</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday, the new and old workers had a clash at the Beisuzhou Road Pier. Each side had dozens of people. At first, they attacked each other with fists and feet, but it was not very intense. Soon, Zhang Asan from the new faction was defeated and fell into the river. Fortunately, he was rescued by a water patrol and did not drown. Then, the two sides each took up weapons. The old faction was armed with carrying poles and sticks. Because many of the new faction members were members of the Wu Song Road Guangdong Triad Society, they had</p>
<p>martial arts training</p>
<p>So they took out spears, swords, and other weapons from the society and faced off again on the riverbank. In an instant, the atmosphere there was tense, and passersby looked on in alarm. Nearby police officers, seeing this situation, quickly reported it to the</p>
<p>police station</p>
<p>Which immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to suppress the fight. The men had already stopped fighting and scattered like birds and beasts. When the detectives arrived, only Zhang Asan's brother, Azu, was left on the ground groaning. His left leg bone had been broken, and</p>
<p>his buttocks and back were all injured</p>
<p>The police arrested six old faction workers: Fang Achun, Dong Qibing, Chen Xingzhang, Wan Yulang, Zhang Chenyao, and Zhang Ailai, and five new faction workers: Xu Yonghong, Chen Wu, Chen Xiang, Chen Zhou, and Zhang Lian. They seized six carrying poles and sticks, four spears, and another weapon, and took them all back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Dai Rongduo interrogated them. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, briefly described the</p>
<p>armed fight incident</p>
<p>Stating that he was prosecuting them for disturbing public order under Article 150 of the Criminal Code. As for the injured Zhang Azu, he had been taken to Tongren Hospital by the police. His injuries were not light, and the case still needed to be investigated. He requested a postponement. The defendant's old faction workers retained lawyer Li Zhongwen for their defense, while the new faction retained lawyer Wu Linkun for their defense. Because the positions of the two sides were different, their defenses contained much mutual attacks. Each side insisted on its own version of events. The court, because the facts of the case still needed to be investigated, questioned each defendant and ordered them all to be remanded in custody for further questioning next Tuesday.</p>

<h3>Cricket Gambling Den Broken Up on Chengdu Road 52 Gamblers Arrested Yesterday Taken to Court for Sentencing and Fines</h3>
<p>Mao Yiwen, Chinese Detective Chief of the Xinzha Police Station, and detectives Wu Changkai, Xu Zhixiang, Wang Qishan, and Weng Peiyu, etc., learned that someone was organizing a cricket gambling den on the upper floor of Dou Pai Su Xi, a pig-slaughtering shop at No. 50, Lane 1050, Chengdu Road. The scale was very large, and the number of gamblers gathered was in the hundreds on holidays, with very large wins and losses. They reported this to the First Special District Court, obtained a search warrant, and rushed to arrest them at 8:30 PM the night before last, together with Western Detective Chief Bao Tai. The gamblers were gathered together, enjoying themselves, so they were arrested. The owners, Han Aquan, Yao Jianzhang, and Yao Shiyuan, and 52 gamblers, including Ping Anan, Chen Xiaolin, Zhang Quanfa, Wang Yuancai, Yan Zheng, Dang Changsheng, Yan Yin, Chen Heyu, Wang Xunliang, Li Yongqing, Chen Bingsheng, Liu Binxi, Ji Youwen, Zhu Baochun, Ding Yonggen, monk Xingguang, and physician Chen Yongshang, etc., were arrested on the spot. Fifty-seven crickets, seventy-five pots, and other gambling paraphernalia used for cricket fighting were seized. The bookkeeper in charge of managing the money at the gambling den escaped, so no gambling funds could be seized. They were all taken back to the police station. Except for Chen Yongshang and 13 others, who were released on bail of 50 yuan each, the rest were detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Koujiu prosecuted them for gambling under Articles 268 and 266 of the Criminal Code, and stated that the defendant Han Aquan was involved in the case of gangster Ding Xiaodi (i.e., Xiao Zifan), who had been sentenced by the court on September 7 for jointly injuring Wang Xiaosan at No. 373, Lane 568, Xinzha Road. Therefore, he requested that Han's part be postponed. After Judge Ye Shengchao interrogated each defendant, he sentenced Yao Jianzhang and Yao Shiyuan to one month of imprisonment each, those released on bail were fined 30 yuan each, and the rest were fined 5 yuan each. Han Aquan's case was postponed for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Military Officer Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Cai Chaojiang, a 33-year-old from Nanjing, resides at No. 77, Shouxian Lane, Fangbang Road in the city. He is a graduate of the fourth class of a certain military academy. He was formerly a military officer but is now unemployed. Due to financial difficulties, he became disillusioned with life. At around 2:00 AM yesterday, he used a razor to stab his throat. Fortunately, his throat was not severed. He bled profusely on the spot. Someone reported this to the Ximen Sub-Bureau, which ordered the police to call an ambulance and rush him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. His injuries are serious and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Clerk from Political Science and Law College Rescued After Attempting Suicide</h3>
<p>Lost 20 Yuan Playing Jai Alai</p>
<p>Became Disillusioned and Attempted Suicide Xia Daohong, also known as Yousheng, a 41-year-old clerk from the Shanghai Political Science and Law College on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, is from Hubei. The day before yesterday evening, he boarded a ferry alone at the Nanmatou Ferry in Pudong. As the boat reached the middle of the river, he suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide while the ferrymen were not paying attention. Fortunately, Chinese Police Officer No. 91 from the Customs Water Patrol Police Station arrived and helped the boatmen rescue him and bring him back to the police station. He confessed that he worked at the college and received a salary of 30 yuan per month. Unexpectedly, he recently lost 20 yuan at the jai alai stadium, which made it difficult for him to make ends meet. So, he became disillusioned with life. His family is all in his hometown. He has a cousin in Shanghai, Xia Anxiu, who is also the Dean of Studies at the college and lives at No. 23, Pushicun, Pushi Road, French Concession. The police chief believed that his confession was probably not so simple, but he did not question him further. That night, he sent Detective Gu Wenkui to his cousin's home to notify him. His male servant, Ye Chunshan, brought dry clothes to the police station to pick up Xia and take him home to comfort him.</p>
<h3>Li Jialong to Succeed as General Manager of Sze Ming Bank</h3>
<p>Li to Assume Office Tomorrow</p>
<p>Sze Ming Bank has had a solid reputation for more than 20 years since its opening. Last year, in order to expand its business, the bank hired Mr. Ye Zhuotang, the current Managing Director of the Central Bank and the Bank of China, to act as General Manager. The business saw further progress. Later, Mr. Ye was ordered by the government to serve as Director of the Central Trust Bureau, which made it difficult for him to continue in both positions, and he requested to resign. After deliberation by the joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the bank, it was decided to hire Mr. Li Jialong to succeed as General Manager. It is said that Mr. Li is scheduled to assume office at the bank on the 29th of this month. Mr. Li Jialong, also known as Runsheng, is the current Manager of the Nanjing Branch of the Central Bank and is knowledgeable and experienced in finance. His appointment as General Manager of Sze Ming Bank is deeply celebrated as a great acquisition for the bank.</p>
<h3>Russian Family's Ama Dies Tragically from Abortion</h3>
<p>Li Zhengshi, also known as Zheng Xiuying, a woman from Hefei, Anhui, is 33 years old this year. Her husband farms in the countryside for a living. She came to Shanghai with her second son, Erbao (12 years old this year), to work as a servant. She is currently an ama for a Russian family in Room 15, Apartment 15, No. 15, Henry Road, French Concession. The mother and son live in the company's room in the employer's house. Ms. Zheng recently had an affair, resulting in pregnancy. Fearing that she would be ashamed to face her husband when she gave birth, she decided to have an abortion. On the night of the 13th of this month, between 8:00 and 9:00 PM, she hired an old midwife surnamed Wang to come to her room to administer medicine to induce an abortion. As a result, she became ill. By the 23rd, her illness had worsened. She ordered her son Bao to call her younger brother, Zheng Tingsheng (31 years old, residing at No. 183, Malang Road, working as a Sixth Two Six police officer in Dongming Deli), to come. She was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's diagnosis, he reported it to the French Police Station as usual. Detectives were dispatched to question her. According to Ms. Zheng, she hired a midwife surnamed Wang, who lived at No. 6, Qiajiatang Road, Qingli, to perform the abortion. The detectives went to Qiajiatang to investigate, but there was only Dao Shengli there, not Dao Qingli. Furthermore, there was no old midwife named Wang living at No. 6, Dao Shengli, so it was impossible to investigate and arrest the person who performed the abortion. Because of her serious illness, treatment was ineffective, and she died in the hospital at around 7:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the police station, which sent a hearse to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch to examine the body and reported the matter to the Second Special District Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren and forensic medical officers went to the office and determined that Li Zhengshi had indeed died from illness after an abortion. Her brother claimed the body.</p>
<h3>Woman Files Criminal Complaint After Divorce Accuses Former Husband and Lawyers</h3>
<p>Claims She Did Not Request Divorce</p>
<p>After Investigation, Claim Deemed Untrue</p>
<p>Xu Maoqing, a 24-year-old woman from Danyang, married Zhu Changgeng, a fellow townsman who runs a small noodle shop in Shanghai, several years ago. Recently, because she wanted to divorce her husband, she hired lawyer Zhou Zhengli to file a lawsuit against Zhu with the First Special District Court for divorce and to request 4,000 yuan in alimony. Zhu hired lawyer Ye Xiazhao to defend him. During the court hearing, under the persuasion of the judge, a settlement was reached for divorce. Zhu paid the woman 500 yuan, and both parties signed the settlement record, closing the case. Unexpectedly, Xu Maoqing has now filed a criminal self-prosecution against lawyers Zhou and Ye and her former husband Zhu Changgeng, claiming that she only requested separation from Zhu at the time and did not advocate for divorce. She was actually deceived by Zhou, Ye, etc., who colluded. She also listed various crimes under Articles 120, 121, 122, 238, and 342 of the Criminal Code in the complaint, requesting that each defendant be punished according to the above articles. A few days ago, Judge Chuan Lin of the First Special Court opened a hearing. The woman failed to appear, and the hearing was postponed to yesterday afternoon. Both parties were present. However, Ye Xiazhao claimed that the woman was making false accusations, so he filed a counterclaim, requesting that she be punished for making false accusations. After Judge Chuan first questioned Xu Maoqing about the divorce settlement in court that day, because the settlement in the case was agreed to by both parties and a record had been made by the judge and court clerk, it was impossible for the lawyers of the two parties to influence it. He questioned the woman about what evidence she had to support the claim that the lawyers had accepted bribes, but Xu Maoqing could not answer. Then, Zhou Zhengli testified that the woman had expressed regret after the divorce settlement. Therefore, she must have been misled by others into thinking that the 500 yuan she received was too little, which led to her current actions of accusing the lawyers. Ye Xiazhao said that this kind of litigation on false pretenses has a real impact on the reputation of lawyers, and requested that the woman be punished according to the law. After careful investigation and inquiry, Judge Chuan found Xu Maoqing's claims to be untrue and the articles of law cited to be erroneous. Considering that the woman was ignorant, he immediately announced the verdict in court: the original lawsuit and the counterclaim were both dismissed, and neither party was guilty.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Seeking Owner of Lost Boy</h3>

<h3>Seducing a Fiancée: Lawsuit Resolved in Court with Conditions Negotiated by the Judge</h3>
<p>Zhang Fenglai, a Suzhou native running a mutton shop at No. 3 Xiangxin Lane, Aierjin Road, Public Concession, has a youngest daughter named Yu Zhen, also known as Xiao Meimei, seventeen years old this year. In the winter of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], she was betrothed through a matchmaker to Shi Xiaodi (apprentice in dental inlay, sixteen years old this year and not yet a full-fledged master), the eldest son of Shi Jinsheng, a fellow townsman in the same trade residing at Peifuli, Huanghe Road, French Concession, to be his wife. After the engagement, the young couple frequently visited each other's homes. In the autumn of last year, Shi Xiaodi lured Zhang Yuzhen to his home in the Suzhou countryside and had illicit sexual relations with her, resulting in pregnancy. In the spring of this year, she gave birth to a daughter. Subsequently, animosity arose between the two families. The Shi family first filed a criminal complaint with the Special No. 1 Court, accusing Zhang Fenglai, Zhang Buqing, and Zhang Yuzhen (father, son, and daughter) of offenses such as disrupting the family, defrauding them of betrothal gifts, theft, and assault. Later, Zhang Fenglai, acting as the legal guardian, along with his daughter Yuzhen, filed a criminal self-accusation with the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Shi Jinsheng and his son Shi Xiaodi of offenses against public morals and the family. This was reported in previous issues. Now, the lawsuit in the Special No. 1 Court has been concluded. The lawsuit in the Special No. 2 Court, after repeated hearings and mediation by Judge Zhang Chao, given that both parties were in-laws and for the sake of the future happiness of their children, should not go to extremes, and were advised to negotiate a settlement out of court. The case was adjourned for further hearing. Yesterday, another summons was issued for a court hearing. The two parties still failed to reach a settlement outside of court. The court advised both parties to reach a settlement in court, setting the following conditions: 1. Before the end of the solar calendar year, Shi Jinsheng would choose a date for his son and daughter-in-law to marry; 2. Separate rooms would be provided; 3. They would cook separately; 4. Shi Jinsheng would provide rent, firewood, and rice; 5. A monthly allowance of thirty yuan for vegetables and pocket money would be provided for a year; 6. The previous betrothal gifts sent by the Qian family would not be pursued. The agreed conditions would be implemented from the date of the marriage and last for one year. After one year, Shi Jinsheng would provide a monthly subsidy of fifteen yuan for six months. Both parties, along with their children, appeared in court and expressed satisfaction with the agreed conditions. After signing the settlement record in court, the private prosecutor requested to withdraw the private prosecution. The court ruled that while Article 227, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law could be withdrawn, Articles 240, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Criminal Law could not be withdrawn and must be adjudicated. After the ruling, the court ruled that the case would not be heard, and the remaining parts were outside its jurisdiction. Both parties thanked the court and left.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor, your newspaper published an article on the 24th, "Jiu Fu Construction Company Sues Foreigner Ju Tong for Fraud," based solely on the plaintiff's one-sided account, which is far from the truth. This matter originated from Jiu Fu and the Japanese, Amano Hachiro, having been in contact for some time, directly entering into a contract stating that the sugar factory was still in preparation and that it was planned to use the old National Factory in the future, but it had not yet been acquired. Jiu Fu, eager to get the business, voluntarily deposited a security deposit with Amano, requesting priority for future housing repairs. Ling Qihong and Mr. Liu (rumored to be not Liu Peilin) repeatedly visited Mr. Dun Gen, asking him to vouch for Amano. If the preparation failed, the security deposit would be returned. Dun Gen informed them of all he knew about the setbacks Amano had suffered in the preparation. The two gentlemen agreed to delay the matter, but then suddenly returned to pester him, expressing extreme respect. Dun Gen, moved by emotions, (1) respected the feelings of the two gentlemen and wanted to associate with them, (2) saw that their contract had the seal of the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai, proving it was not false, (3) could not resist the sweet talk of being offered the position of Chinese manager in the future, so he reluctantly signed the guarantee. However, at that time, he stated that he guaranteed the original amount of money and would not be liable for other responsibilities. Amano also personally requested a written guarantee from him, which proves that Dun Gen never participated in the internal affairs. The plaintiff's claim that Dun Gen went to the National Factory with them to direct everything is pure fantasy. Dun Gen was not present when the payment was made and was not involved in the Finance Department's appointment. Such slander is a disgrace to the moral standards of the legal profession. Furthermore, the address mentioned, No. 1 North Daihe Road, is where Amano lived. Dun Gen only stayed there for a few weeks in the spring to urge Amano to proceed or refund the money, and then left in disappointment. He had already prepared to compensate, but Amano's foreign firm had five machines that he promised to sell to offset the debt, which caused delays and ultimately led to the breakup. In short, the plaintiff should not attribute his dealings with Amano to Dun Gen. Guarantees for compensation are a civil matter and should not be brought as a criminal lawsuit to harm fellow countrymen. I humbly request your chief editor to uphold your reputation for impartiality and to make the correction. Sincerely, Wang Dun Gen, October 25, 1936, in Songjiang.</p>

<p>Recently, newspapers have reported on the diligence and difficulty of the home visit work of the Shanghai National Products Promotion Federation, and the self-reports of the visitors, while lamenting the difficulty of the visit work, are quite admirable for their determination and perseverance.</p>
<p>We believe that home visits are not difficult, but it is difficult to make each family understand the importance of the visit work. Housewives are the masters of the family. Who has no reason, who has no emotion, who is willing to take the daily necessities from imported goods? If newspapers promote them at any time, spread them in the news, write them into comments, or use text to advocate, or use pictures to express, or make good use of advertisements, or take photographs, so that everyone knows, everyone knows that national product visits are indispensable, this is one. Secondly, radio stations should introduce them well before or after the start of the program, inform them with a camera, and tell them the fun of visiting work, so that housewives can understand them in advance, understand them in their minds, and will not be incompatible once they arrive at the door, this is the second. Furthermore, women's organizations such as the Young Women's Christian Association, the Women's Temperance Association, and the Shanghai Women's Association, etc., are enthusiastic ladies who do not hesitate to bother and introduce them widely, so that housewives in each family are enthusiastic about it, and actively participate in the women's use of national products association to serve the society by themselves, all of which are the help that all parties should have. It is to increase the work efficiency of the five female visitors. I hope that all of you will love the country from now on, and make a little contribution to the national industry.</p>
<h3>College Students and National Products</h3>
<p>— Li Gu Jun</p>
<p>Promoting the use of domestic goods is originally the responsibility of the nationals of a country, especially the knowledgeable nationals should know the importance of using domestic goods. However, the situation in our country is showing an abnormal phenomenon. College students who have received higher education have long put the four words "use domestic goods" out of the nine heavens. If you don't believe it, we only need to visit any university to know that my words are correct. Now let me report the actual living conditions of college students!</p>
<p>1. In terms of clothing: Generally, college students who claim to be extraordinary generally think that after entering university, it is not an honor to wear a suit and leather shoes, and it is not enough to show their identity; talking about general female students, almost all of them are drawing eyebrows and eyes, perming their hair, and wearing high heels. What kind of Qiaoqi gauze and French crepe... can be used as the material for cheongsam, otherwise they will lose the rules of modern and are not enough to show their beauty.</p>
<p>2. In terms of diet: The school obviously has a large kitchen and a cooperative, but the price is too cheap, the side dishes are not to their taste, and there are rules for a few people to be at a table. Who wants to follow the rules when eating? A group of sharp-eyed restaurant owners, in order to cater to the psychology of college students, stipulated a kind of meal ticket system, one yuan can buy five or six, and one yuan for a big dish ticket can buy three. Each person can share the food, and the taste is of course to their liking. What's more wonderful is that the classification of restaurants is also based on the hometown of college students? What are Guangdong cafeterias, Sichuan restaurants, and Saint Anna Western Restaurants... beautiful and moving signs.</p>
<p>3. In terms of housing: A group of small real estate developers, in order to cater to the psychology of college students, knowing that college students do not want to live on campus, feeling all kinds of inconveniences, successively built new-style bungalows and apartment-like dormitories near the university, with all kinds of sanitary facilities. Generally, college students who are used to enjoying themselves, who would not want to stay here.</p>
<p>4. In terms of travel: It's no longer a problem! There are school buses in the school. If you think it is inconvenient, you only need to make a phone call, and in less than five minutes, the automobile line will send a car. Even streetcars and buses must be first-class.</p>
<p>After reading the above situation, the life of college students is so enviable! No, it is completely Westernized. Do they still care about the country's expectations of them in their daily lives? They have forgotten the instructions of their fathers and brothers when they left, let alone promote "using domestic goods."</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Ministry of Education in the Republic of China in 19th year, there is only one college student in every 10,000 people in China. If the population of our country is 450 million, the people who have received higher education—college students—are only 45,000. Alas! If every college student wears a suit on average, and each suit is priced at 30 yuan (Note: Of course, not every college student wears a suit, and female students are an exception, but our calculation assumes that everyone has a set of suits, including female students' clothes, rouge, and the unnecessary expenses of male and female college students, etc.), it has already leaked 1,350,000 yuan a year! This is such an amazing thing!</p>
<p>To prevent college students from wasting, we can only beg the authorities of the university and the general parents to set an example, and ban college students from illegally consuming clothes, food, housing, etc. Only in this way can we get on the right track of "using domestic goods."</p>
<h3>Introducing the China National Products Promotion Institute</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>Recently, there seems to be no good news in the national product industry, and the rampant smuggling is even more worrying. But we must know that there are still many people who are working hard on national products. We should "only ask about cultivation, not about harvest." For example, the China National Products Promotion Institute in Suzhou is a powerful group in the inland, so we should be optimistic about the future of national products.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the National Products Promotion Institute is Mr. Wei Shida, a Bachelor of Engineering from Jiaotong University. And he hired many vocationally trained personnel to assist him. Mr. Wei was formerly the Director of the Construction Bureau of Wuxian and Donghai Counties, a person with a scientific mind who is extremely enthusiastic about the national product business. He abandoned his official career to do this thankless social cause, which shows his ambition.</p>
<p>On the one hand, their work is to plan the promotion and management of products for national product manufacturers, and on the other hand, they pay more attention to market surveys and the collection of user opinions. These are not available to other national product groups. The rest of the research on products and the acceptance of agency commissions are their due tasks. In short, they do everything with scientific management, seek truth from facts, do not emphasize exaggeration, and do not aim at profits.</p>
<p>Their vision has many unique points. They set up the site in Suzhou, preparing to first do a unit experiment area from the six counties near Suzhou, and then gradually expand to various inland areas in the future. The reason why they are not established in Shanghai is because Shanghai can only be close to the product manufacturers, and at the same time, publicity is convenient. For promotion, we should seek to connect with consumers. This is enough to show the thorough thinking and long-term vision of the holder.</p>
<p>The introduction is briefly exhausted here. Finally, I hope that they will slowly expand the region, and I hope that they will contribute the precise survey results to the export manufacturers, and be able to set up factories on the spot in the future, so that the national light industry will not be completely concentrated in Shanghai, otherwise there will be unlimited crises in the future.</p>
<p>Note: The address of the China National Products Promotion Institute is inside Panmen, Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Introducing Domestic Beer Bottles</h3>
<p>— Yushu</p>
<p>Domestic beer, since the advent of Yantai and Five Stars, etc., has a large sales volume every year due to its excellent quality, giving imported goods a serious blow.</p>
<p>However, domestic beer feels that the only shortcoming is that the beer bottles are all foreign goods, because the procedure of beer manufacturing, after the beer is put into the bottle, must undergo several evaporations with very high heat, and ordinary bottles cannot withstand the heat, so they will burst, so foreign goods must be used.</p>
<p>Because of the problem of these beer bottles, domestic beer is often easily suspected by those who are enthusiastic about using domestic goods, so some manufacturers specially attach a statement on the beer bottles to dispel misunderstandings, but Tao is ultimately a troublesome task.</p>
<p>Recently, it is said that Jinghua Glass Factory has this beer bottle produced. On the one hand, this can reduce many leaks, and at the same time, it can also increase the value of domestic beer.</p>
<p>I hope that domestic beer will use domestic beer bottles from the next year!</p>

<h3>Glimpses</h3>
<p>— (Tai Xuan)</p>
<p>A chicken lays an egg, and the egg hatches into a chick – everyone knows this. But if we want to delve further, did the chicken come first, or the egg? This question is not easy to answer. Because without the chicken, there would be no eggs, and without eggs, where would the chicken come from? Some say that poultry are all oviparous, which is true, but it is precisely because they are oviparous that this becomes a difficult and perplexing problem.</p>
<p>"Born in sorrow, die in comfort." Who doesn't want to live a life of ease and comfort? Who doesn't struggle to make a living from the two necessities of clothing and food? Because everyone struggles to make a living, the output of life is being expanded as much as possible every day, and thus competition arises. People are divided into the wise and foolish, the strong and weak. The result of competition is naturally the survival of the fittest. The same is true between people as between countries. When the people of one country feel that the development of their own country's livelihood cannot meet the demand, their target shifts to the neighboring country. This is called "aggression." We are now being trapped in this environment, so we are all in a state of distress, and in order to seek our livelihood, we have to constantly strive and struggle!</p>
<h3>Women's Liberation Under X-rays</h3>
<p>— Shuang Mi</p>
<p>Here, we can clearly understand the shocking achievements of modern women in the so-called "liberation" they have achieved in their struggles and efforts. In fact, although this cry has been echoing for many years, it is still a superficial "decoration". Rather than "liberation," it would be more refreshing to call it a "modern puppet."</p>
<p>Now, let's dissect the so-called "liberation" as follows:</p>
<p>Hair – Because it is "cut," you rarely see thick, long braids!</p>
<p>Ears – Liberated from the troublesome procedure of wearing earrings.</p>
<p>Eyes – Able to use a kind of "charming" attraction, and can look at people directly!</p>
<p>Eyebrows – Changed to be thin and long, this is to protect the beauty of the eyes!</p>
<p>Cheeks – After the surgery of the beauty salon, they rarely apply two points of thick lead powder containing a large amount of lime!</p>
<p>Mouth – Able to argue fluently in front of men!</p>
<p>Teeth – At least learn the small skill of chewing Luran fragrant gum.</p>
<p>Lips – Performing beautiful postures when kissing.</p>
<p>Chest – Not wearing a corset reveals its height.</p>
<p>Legs – Not wearing stockings is a kind of "contribution of flesh."</p>
<p>Feet – Walking like Manchurian women on "stilts."</p>
<p>This is just a "trend" because women's liberation must fundamentally progress with the advancement of the times!</p>
<h3>Expulsion Order</h3>
<p>— Xian Weisheng</p>
<p>When the author was young, he often heard his elders say: There is a folk method of "expelling guests" that is quite effective. For example, if a "rotten bench leg" of a friend comes to your house, and is bothering you and doesn't want to leave, the host, while being outwardly agreeable, only needs to secretly tell his family to put a broom behind the door, and that annoying friend will naturally feel the "urge to return," and bid farewell and leave. However, this matter is close to absurdity, and I thought it was not credible. Now, the "expulsion order" I am talking about is neither expressed in words nor requires carrying guns or sticks. Once the order is issued, the guest will naturally know to slip away tactfully.</p>
<p>In the past, in the officialdom, there was a custom that officials meeting each other absolutely avoided saying too much "idle" talk. After a few key points were made, they had to excuse themselves to leave. Especially inferiors to superiors, this point had to be paid attention to. Therefore, during the conversation between host and guest, if you heard a "serve tea," you should quickly be tactful and immediately shout "bring the sedan chair," bid farewell and leave. Because it is called "serving tea," in fact, it is urging you to "get lost" quickly.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, the owners of the show venues tell a few ballad singers to decide who will go on stage to tell their stories. Whoever tells the story the most "relaxed" is the one with the most "skill." The main story is told very briefly, and the one with the most "jokes" is the winner. At this time, if the speaker's skill is a bit "lacking," and the story is not very good, and they cannot win the audience's welcome, sorry, the shouts of "pour water" or "wring the towel" will follow. However, once this slogan comes out, listening friends, it is better to be tactful. The "waiting for the next show" person will understand, otherwise, it may make you "lose face"!</p>
<h3>Little Lingzi and Raw Pear</h3>
<p>— Man Zi</p>
<p>After watching the "Little Lingzi" produced by the Star Film Company, I thought it had the same taste as the raw pear I often chew these days: crisp, sweet, and tender, very light and cheerful, with a sense of pleasure on the tip of my tongue, but with a hint of sourness when you bite into the core. This refers to the story itself.</p>
<p>The entire performance is elastic. The progress of the story is not sticky or greasy, and it passes very smoothly, but there are some counter-reactions everywhere. This counter-reaction is mapped out with a relaxed technique, asking people to understand and appreciate it in the details. This is very similar to the characteristics of raw pears. Therefore, lychees can be eaten three hundred at a time, while raw pears need to be chewed slowly, piece by piece.</p>
<p>The performance and technique can be said to be completely consistent, so there are no overly exaggerated scenes, no deliberately added jokes. Whether it is an extremely small action or an extremely large meaning, it is performed very naturally and vividly. As Su Dongpo said, "Stop where you must stop, and do what you must do." The director has grasped this secret.</p>
<p>When the general public criticizes Chinese films, they always say that they are too much like civilized plays. The drawback of civilized plays is that they speak for the sake of speaking, often disregarding the plot. The dialogue of Little Lingzi is able to suit the plot. When it should be fast, it is never delayed, and when it should be slow, it is never slippery. Its highs and lows, strengths and weaknesses, are consistent with the melody of the performance as the plot progresses.</p>
<p>This film is not only unique in the Star Film Company, but also a creation in the past domestic films. Cheng Bugao has already shown his transformation technique in "New and Old Shanghai," and in Little Lingzi, it is a transformation.</p>
<p>These days can be called the "raw pear season," then the raw pear-like "Little Lingzi" is exactly what we need, and a feast for the eyes. Therefore, putting aside consciousness, it is also a masterpiece.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Lu Xun</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Exhausted years "outcrying," the public then succeeds, dead end, "wandering," where do I return?</p>
<p>"Outcry" and "Wandering" are collections of short stories written by Mr. Lu Xun, which I deeply admire.</p>
<h3>Changing Nest Luan and Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: High Fraternal Love Hides Letter Pitying Weak Sister, Strong Poetic and Scholarly Air Peeks at Shadow Laughing at Cold Scholar</p>
<p>He stretched out his head and smelled the Pearl Orchid, and said with a smile, "Does Cousin really like light green?" Guoqi said, "How can you tell?" Youmei said, "Because orchids are light green." Guoqi laughed, "So that's how you figured it out. Actually, I don't care that much about orchids. I love all flowers that are quiet and not too seductive." Youmei said, "Isn't it better for flowers to be more beautiful? Why don't you like those that are too beautiful?" Guoqi smiled and said, "That's because of what Ms. Li said about being rich in poetry and books." Youmei saw that although he was constantly laughing and talking, he was wearing a long gown and sitting upright, and he was not very natural. Especially the slight beads of sweat on his forehead showed that he was impatient. She stood up and said, "Auntie, let's go outside to the hall to sit." Cousin, you should do your homework. Guoqi said, "Although there is wind in the hall, it is not as cool as this room." Youmei smiled. "Cousin, I don't think you need to be polite. If I sit here, you can't take off your long gown. If you accompany us to sit outside, you have to put on your long gown. It's too impolite for a guest. I have some things I want to ask my cousin for advice. But I've decided, cousin, don't be too polite with me." Guoqi couldn't find anything to say to answer him, so he just smiled. He had no choice but not to come out to accompany the guests. Youmei arrived at the hall, and through a bamboo curtain, she kept looking inside. The white figure flickered a little at first, and then disappeared, and even the sound was gone. Youmei talked with Aunt Zhang for two hours. The sun was already setting, so she got up to say goodbye. When Aunt Zhang sent him to the patio, he turned around and walked to the door of the study, and first shouted, "Cousin, I'm leaving, see you next time." As he spoke, he lifted the hanging bamboo curtain. But he saw him lying on his desk, putting a very beautiful foreign stationery in front of him, and writing a letter with a steel pen dipped in blue ink. And the words he wrote were in English. This was a very ordinary thing for students, but it left an impression in his mind, and he felt that it was worth the trip? (91)</p>
<h3>Crab Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Once Mid-Autumn Festival is over, crabs immediately replace mooncakes on the market, and it is another season for eating crabs. In the city of Shanghai, we can see the sale of Yangcheng Lake crabs everywhere in the crab stalls. I always feel that the crabs bought are soft and tasteless, far less delicious than the crabs produced in my hometown of Songjiang.</p>
<p>The reason is that the crabs produced in our hometown, although not as large as the so-called Yangcheng Lake crabs in Shanghai, are much more delicious than Yangcheng Lake crabs in terms of taste. I haven't tasted the taste of crabs from my hometown for a long time. Until last year, my family sent a basket of crabs, and I compared them with Yangcheng Lake crabs on the spot. Indeed, the crabs from our hometown are much more delicious, so my advocacy for eating crabs is not about size, but about whether the crab meat is delicious.</p>
<p>In autumn, the fishermen in my hometown are all energized and focused on the work of catching crabs. Some use nets, some use crab traps, and they can catch crabs worth hundreds of dollars in a crab market. It is also a huge income. However, catching crabs is always done at night, setting up lights and nets, and staying up all night, which is also very hard.</p>
<p>When we were young, after eating crabs, we had to keep the crab dice and put them in a charcoal basket. We walked to the river and sank the charcoal basket to the bottom of the river. In less than a quarter of an hour, we picked up the charcoal basket and often caught a few eels and small fish, which we used as a pastime.</p>
<p>After the crab shells are washed, dried, and ground into powder, they are burned with Atractylodes and Angelica dahurica, and all the windows and doors are closed tightly. All the bedbugs in the room can be killed within two hours. It is a good method for killing bedbugs, but people have to leave when burning.</p>
<h3>Travels in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Sparse lights and faint shadows halo green and yellow, this day returning makes the heart grieve, I have endured life and death for ten years, the vast wind and rain enter the golden lot. (Ten years ago, I visited this state with my deceased friend. Today, returning again, the wind and rain fill the sky, I cannot bear the abdominal pain.)</p>
<p>Mountain light and pagoda shadow both green and red, lingering bell sounds ripple in the distant sky, after the rain, I leisurely sit alone, Wu girls advise guests to watch the red maple. (Sitting on a sedan chair on Tiger Hill)</p>
<p>The hegemonic cause of the King of Wu has long ceased to exist, the palace terraces of a thousand years fall in the setting sun, it should be that the spirit has transformed into a huge stone, gazing at the lake to await the return of the beauty. (There is a stone turtle in front of the Xizi Dressing Table, named Bird Turtle Gazing at Taihu Lake)</p>
<p>The romantic affairs of the Wu Palace are said to be absurd, this place once adorned Xizi's makeup, now I look far from the terrace, the lake light is seen where the green mountains are missing. (Looking far from the Xizi Dressing Table)</p>
<p>Yu Ran watched the osmanthus flowers in those years, on the returning boat he recalled the autumn colors in his drunkenness, still today at the place where poems are inscribed on the white wall, how many tourists speak of the Shi family. (The Mu Xu Shi Family Hotel is famous for its lungs tonifying soup. Mr. Yu Yanxin has a poem saying, the old osmanthus flowers bloom fragrant throughout the world, watching flowers I have walked all over Taihu Lake, one thing on the returning boat is still worth remembering, thank you Shi Family's lungs tonifying soup.)</p>
<p>Water reflects the light of the lamps making a winding snake, the lonely city dimly slants in the rain, the intention of the pedestrians to return is like sparks, drunk I hasten in the evening car from Pingmen. (Returning from Pingmen in the evening) (Ai Lu)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>The Most Economical New Women's Clothing</h3>
<p>— Ou Si</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's largest money-consuming den. Generally, wealthy officials, merchants, and playboys like to transport the money they have collected in batches to Shanghai to spend, and a larger part of it is spent on women, and their money is completely consumed on clothing. Girls love nature, and they originally specialize in competing for beauty in clothing. Anyway, when they buy their favorite items, someone will willingly rush to pay the bill for them, without having to pay out of their own pockets, and they are happy to be generous with other people's money, indulging in luxury and wasting arbitrarily. Even if it is unavoidable, and they sometimes have to use their personal savings, it is okay for them to spend money like dirt, and they are not very cherishing. Wealthy daughters and courtesans are naturally overspending, but some small family women are accustomed to the luxurious appearance of wealthy women. They can't resist the temptation of materials, and they are jealous. They are unwilling to abide by their duties, and they deliberately imitate wealthy women, trying to get a little bit of silk and fragrance, fearing that they will mess up their hair and clothes, and bury their innate beauty. Gold, pearls, jade, and diamonds are worth millions, and of course the poor cannot reach them. Only clothing is one item that they can spend all their energy on, barely piecing together one or two pieces, allowing them to imitate Xizi's frown. Therefore, Shanghai's silk shops and tailors rely on women as their only major customers. In the past ten years, there has been a so-called new clothing company, which has emerged in response to the trend. For a time, they have sprung up like mushrooms, adding dozens of companies, and each one is doing booming business and is considered the easiest way to make money at present. Many artists, whose learning is not used, and whose strengths are violated, cannot make a living from art in China. Taking advantage of the opportunity, they have joined the new clothing companies one after another, becoming drawing and design pattern makers.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the new clothing company, it was able to prescribe the right medicine and make ten times the profit, because "new clothes are not pressing," which has been the case since ancient times. Those modern women have already reached the peak of selecting beautiful clothing materials, and they cannot be more picky. They have to start a new stove and strive for novelty in form, and they really need someone to come up with ideas and change patterns for them. They don't care about spending a few more dollars at all. It is said that at that time, a very ordinary blue cloth cheongsam would actually sell for twelve or thirteen yuan after the new clothing company's process. It is even more common for expensive materials to cost from tens of yuan to hundreds of yuan per piece. In Shanghai, only women's money is the easiest to cheat! In the past, although women's clothes often changed patterns, they could still maintain the status quo for a year or two. Recently, however, it has progressed like flying. Before two or five months, they have already changed completely. It has become mysterious and unpredictable. The new clothes made in the spring will be laughed at by the public as ancient monsters and outdated styles when they are worn out again in the fall. Therefore, women's clothes are not worth much after they are made. Those that cost dozens of dollars to make, even if they are still brand new and have never been worn, can only be pawned for one or two dollars in the pawnshop, which is considered good. Recently, they simply refuse to accept them because the styles change too quickly. If they are not redeemed when they expire, there is no other way except to send them to the antique display cabinet!</p>
<p>However, in the past year or two, the new clothing company has also become the end of its rope. This is nothing more than being affected by the recession. In today's poor and exhausted people, who has the extra strength to provide their spoiled wife and friends with six-sided renovations? This summer, due to the needs of the times, they invented a very economical new outfit. They only need to spend a few yuan to cut a few feet of black Xiangyun yarn to make a cheongsam. From famous ladies, singing and dancing stars, to the courtesans, to the sisters-in-law in the attic, they no longer have to wear other clothes. They only need to wear a pair of triangular shorts, and even the pants can be saved. With bare legs and feet, they wear a pair of leather shoes with bright red painted toes. In total, it only costs five or six yuan, and they already have everything they need from head to toe. They are like a very beautiful modern girl. What a cheap and good thing!</p>
<p>If we only observe from the surface, this may not be good news to raise the voice of thrift, but the cost of each clothing material is only one or two yuan, while the tailor's wages cost more than two or three yuan, which has a tendency to be top-heavy! Alas! The Shanghai women who are fond of vanity and like to waste money actually think about saving money. The degree of exhaustion of social finance can be imagined!</p>

<h3>Zhongjiao's Arbitrage Exchange Rate; As a Result, There is Still No Change</h3>
<p>The exchange rate was initially flat due to Zhongjiao's stop on the British pound and the US dollar, and the general trend was stagnant and still flat.

The British exchange rate was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 4375 and a half pence to match, and the US exchange rate was 29 yuan and a half, compared to the previous closing, the British pound and the US dollar were flat. After the opening, the banks scrambled to sell US dollars, and although there were buyers, the situation was still stable. The HSBC Bank's listing was announced, the British pound and the US dollar were flat, and the white silver balance tax did not move, and people's hearts began to turn stable again. Therefore, there was only foreign bank's exchange for Zhongjiao's British pound and US dollar, and the situation was still quiet. Traffic stopped on the forward US surplus, but foreign banks ate it, and although the forward was stopped, it was only in the dark market. In the afternoon, the banks were hesitant to sell the shilling first and then stop it, and the general trend was slightly dazed. The Indian silver rose one anna, but it also lacked stimulation, and the closing selling price was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 4687 force for the British exchange rate, and 19 yuan and a half for the US exchange rate, compared to the previous closing, the British pound and the US dollar were flat.

<h3>Securities; After Trading Stopped This Month; The Rise and Fall of Forward Public Debt is Very Slight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Merchants Securities Exchange, October futures, has stopped trading, and is prepared for delivery on the 29th, so the market is only doing November futures for one month. The market situation has a slight rise and fall, and can be called stable. December futures began to enter the market today. The environment is still brewing, and the solution is not easy, and the sacrifice is not desired by any party. The confusing and dazed situation makes the public debt continue to oscillate, so there are still many reversals in the future. Yesterday's passing, the opening in the morning, unanimously rose by 12 jiao, the second plate retail investors bought in, and continued to rise by 12 jiao. In the afternoon, No. 4 and No. 32 had a lot of selling, and the market price suddenly became virtual, and uniformly returned to a loose 1 jiao to 3 jiao and a half. The closing rebounded by 5 fen and 1 jiao. The overall trend was generally hovering. The market price result was slightly better by 5 fen and 1 jiao and a half. The total number of transactions, including spot goods, was 2,627,000 yuan The rise and fall results are compared and listed on the left, (unit yuan transaction unit 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Hardware East White Iron Price Increase, But No Sales Yet</h3>
<p>Since the agreed-upon price increase for East White Iron, the clientele has suddenly become scarce, and manufacturers are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. Due to the market being quiet, those holding inventory are eager to sell because the end of the month is approaching. Therefore, the market appears firm but is subtly weakening. Yesterday's market prices were approximately $1.03 per sheet for 37-inch iron (agreed-upon price was $1.05), and $0.84 for 36-inch iron (agreed-upon price was $0.88), both of which are $0.02 to $0.04 lower than the agreed-upon prices. Aside from some retail sales, large-scale transactions have reportedly not yet materialized.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Outside Factories Continue to Sell Surplus, Cotton Yarn Price Decline Intensifies, Many Speculators Close Positions, Market Prices Increasingly Difficult to Sustain</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak, and the price decline is intensifying. Although it is usually the time for the October futures delivery to be actively sold, the factories unexpectedly delivered a total of 1,000 bales of 20-count "Yu Cheng," "Double Deer," "Golden Pagoda," and other yarns. This caused great disappointment and a blow to confidence in the market. At the same time, the prices of Japanese yarn warehouse receipts and one-week futures differed by more than ten yuan, and they were sold off aggressively in the market, further depressing market sentiment. Current yarn, due to its high price, is even more stagnant. Therefore, outside factories continue to sell surplus inventory.</p>
<p>Nearly 4.8 Yuan Plummet in Recent Month</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market opened weakly. Due to the arrival of new yarn last month and the relatively soft delivery prices, confidence was weak. In addition, due to excessive prices, all parties needed to remain stagnant, and there were few new buyers. The market trend inclined downwards, step by step. However, a certain gentleman still held a long position, but foreign merchants were bearish and sold off continuously. As a result of the bidding, each month's closing price fell by 1.3, 4, 5, and 9 jiao (tenths of a yuan) to 2.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw the market trend further weaken, and spot yarn transactions halted, with many speculators closing positions. Market prices were difficult to support. Distant months were also affected and declined. The future trend depends on actual demand. As a result, the November price fell another 2.7 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and distant prices fell 7 jiao to 1.2, 5, and 6 jiao. It was found that 3,100 bales of Hengyi, 1,350 bales of Jifeng, 1,100 bales of Tonghe, 1,000 bales of Dafeng, 3,850 bales of Hexing, 2,300 bales of Senkang, 1,050 bales of Changfeng, 1,800 bales of Xincheng, 1,250 bales of Tongji, 700 bales of Minghua, and 700 bales of Zhenda were sold. Purchases included 1,950 bales of Mingde, 1,050 bales of Yukang, 2,700 bales of Yuda, 1,300 bales of Jinchang, 4,250 bales of Gengfeng, 1,100 bales of Changji, 3,650 bales of Weiyu, 1,900 bales of Dachangcheng, and 2,700 bales of Runkang. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Only 300 Bales of Yarn Sold</p>
<p>The sales of current yarn remained sluggish. It was found that all guilds bought a total of 300 bales throughout the day, and the selling price fell by 2.3 yuan. The purchase amount of each guild is as follows:</p>
<h3>American Cotton Plummets for Seven Consecutive Days, Bidding Price Spirals Downward, Prices Fall Around One Yuan Each Month</h3>
<p>The cotton market is declining because American cotton has plummeted for seven consecutive days, and the situation is very weak. Longs are panicking, and the trading floor is loose. The market price is falling step by step. This month, the price broke through the one-yuan mark, and the forward prices all broke through the two-yuan mark. Sales at current cotton factories have stagnated.</p>
<p>Nearly One Yuan Decline Recently</p>
<p>The bidding for cotton opened with a weak trend, because 70,000 to 80,000 dan (a unit of weight) of old, coarse cotton were delivered the previous day. Although this batch of goods was bought by fellow traders, it will not be easy to sell it all. In addition, the decline in American cotton is very intense, which has dampened market confidence. The market price is falling step by step, but most cotton merchants are consistently absorbing and anticipating a rise. As a result of the bidding, the closing prices for each month fell by 0.45 to 0.56 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw the current month's momentum quite weak, with few buyers in the market, and the market price became increasingly loose. Each closing price fell by 3, 4, and 6 jiao compared to the previous month's closing price. It was found that 4,400 dan of Juxing, 1,300 dan of Tongji, 1,800 dan of Kang, 1,100 dan of Jifeng, 2,700 dan of Xiaoyi, 1,600 dan of Shenchang, 1,600 dan of Ren, 2,500 dan of Yikang, 1,000 dan of Yuanxingchang, 1,200 dan of Xinchang, 3,500 dan of Minghua, and 3,200 dan of Senlian were sold. Purchases included 4,300 dan of Runlian, 4,700 dan of Chang, 4,000 dan of Tongfu, 3,400 dan of Dafeng, 2,100 dan of Jinchang, 8,400 dan of Mingde, 14,500 dan of Gengfeng, 2,800 dan of Fengtai, 1,600 dan of Changfeng, 3,000 dan of Shengyuan, 2,300 dan of Yuanda, and 1,700 dan of Shenji. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Sales at Current Cotton Factories have Stagnated</p>
<p>The consumption of current cotton is quite low, the factory's appetite is blocked, and the sources are 2,150 bales of Yao cotton and 1,820 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>Ginning Report Favors Sellers, American Cotton Falls More Than Ten Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices ranging from unchanged to falling by 3 points. Early in the morning, longs closed out positions, cotton farmers sold short, and the stock market was weak. The ginning report favored sellers, and market sentiment was sluggish. Traders continued to buy on price dips, and shorts covered their positions due to rain in the west. However, most buyers remained on the sidelines, waiting for the next government estimate. Spot cotton prices were able to maintain. The closing price fell by 12 points for spot cotton and 12 to 14 points for futures. English spot cotton fell by 4 points, and futures fell by 23 points. Indian cotton rose due to the rise in Japanese yarn, short covering, and a lack of sellers. Pingguo rose by 0.75 to 1 rupee, Aomula rose by 0.75 to 1.25 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is on the left (dated the 26th).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 27th was: Bai Luo Creek at 218 rupees, down 1.75 rupees; Aomula at 194 rupees, down 2.5 rupees; and Pingguo at 155 rupees, down 2.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Cotton Exports from Rangoon</h3>
<p>A Mumbai telegram dated the 26th stated that the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week totaled 268 tons, all destined for Osaka.</p>
<p>American Cotton's Sixth Ginning Report A Washington telegram dated the 26th stated that the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Statistics released the sixth ginning report today as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>
<h3>Three-Product Yarn Expected to Continue Rising Two Yuan Soon</h3>
<p>An Osaka telegram dated the 27th stated that three-product futures yarn rose by one yuan to falling by 0.3 yuan, with the near month at 221.6 yuan and the distant month at 207.4 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan, with the near month at 64.7 yuan and the distant month at 65.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Follows Yarn Prices Downward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was affected by the current downward trend in bidding yarn and spot yarn. The cost of various cotton cloths gradually decreased, and actual sales stagnated, leading to a downward trend in cloth prices. White goods, fine cloth, fine twill, city cloth, and 84 cloth all fell (per piece) by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Printed flannel, serge, and line wool fell (per yard) by 0.0025 to 0.01 yuan. Jardine Matheson's Golden Pagoda bleached cloth opened for sale yesterday at 9 yuan per piece, a decrease of 0.25 yuan compared to the previous hand's selling price. Miscellaneous brand, locally produced lower-grade bleached cloth also fell (by 0.22 yuan per piece). Customers from various guilds temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude due to expectations of further declines, but orders continued to arrive. The Cantonese guild purchased more than 400 bales of heavy-weight 16-pound and 14-pound coarse cloth from local factories for several days. Small amounts of 14-pound to 6-pound coarse cloth for military needs along the Yangtze River also added more than 300 bales. Spot goods still felt scarce. The Fujian guild purchased more than 100 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, blue cloth, serge, and line wool. Sales to inland guilds were the most sluggish. The sales momentum of various patterned goods was still good.</p>
<h3>Grains: Dalian Price Report Lower, Forward Wheat Plummets More Than One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw the morning opening with a relatively stable market trend. Because foreign wheat was slightly better by about 0.3 yuan, the near-term opening price once continued to rise by 0.05 to 0.07 yuan. The current month, because it was the last day, initially showed signs of short covering, so the highest price was 6.07 yuan. November reached 6.25 yuan. However, prices for December and beyond fell gradually as longs liquidated their positions, and confidence gradually declined. By the afternoon opening, each month fell sharply across the board. Because the Dalian price report was lower and the current situation had lessened in severity, non-industry speculators liquidated aggressively. The final closing price for the current month was as low as 5.96 yuan (down 0.1 jiao and 0.04 yuan compared to the morning). The remaining months fell sharply, from 0.13 to 0.16 yuan. Spot wheat remained stable, with Shandong Yingzhou wheat opening at 6.05 yuan, second grade at 6.02 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 6.0 yuan, second grade at 6.0 yuan, Yanghe wheat at 6.0 yuan, Guangshui wheat at 5.99 yuan, second grade at 5.95 yuan, and Yaowan wheat at 5.95 yuan. Fuxin and other major factories handled 1,000 bags each, and Zaofeng handled 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Flour Futures Also Plunge — Factories Short Near Months, Long Distant Months —</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, showed a trend of initial stability followed by decline. With foreign wheat quotes slightly better by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan, confidence strengthened after the opening price, rising by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. However, the market had already reached its peak. In addition to non-industry longs who were still buying, traders and customers mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so transactions were relatively light, and volume was not significant. By the afternoon opening, near months were still stable, but distant months reversed and fell sharply. Because factories held near months short and sold distant months long in large quantities, and because the grain market fell due to reports of declines in the Grand Canal, causing significant drops, confidence became even more unstable. Distant month closing prices fell sharply by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Guild Actively Buying Coarse Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of guest xian rice continued to be strong. In the morning opening, each type of rice was relatively soft. Subsequently, the Cantonese guild suddenly started buying aggressively, and factories also competed to buy, so prices rose. However, both the Cantonese guild and the factories were keen to buy coarse xian rice, so coarse rice jumped up by 0.2 yuan, while other types of rice only rose by a few fen (hundredths of a yuan). More than 10,000 bags of various types of xian rice were sold throughout the day, with coarse rice accounting for the majority. The entire day saw the sale of 3,110 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3,730 bags of Hunan rice, 35 bags of Taiwan glaze, and 3,000 bags of Shashi coarse rice, mainly to the Cantonese guild. The local traders decided to send only one or two hundred bags of Yuan rice to Beiyang and Quanzhou.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices in Heshang Fall</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the total source for various guilds was 44 or 45 companies, totaling over 9,000 shi (a unit of volume). Street sales were average. Qingyan and Qinhuangdao guilds purchased nearly 2,000 bags of new thin indica rice and over 1,000 bags of thick new japonica rice, so the market situation was still weak. New rice and japonica rice depreciated by 0.07 yuan. Cha Zhong Bai Ge and other varieties all revised down by 0.05 yuan. Dujian was flat, while foreign jian rice had good sales and continued to rise by 0.05 yuan. Mo Bo broken japonica rice was similar to before. The new Yin Yuan continued to fall by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 55 to 56 suppliers from various sources arrived in Heshang. The market transactions were unusually sluggish. The price of new japonica rice was short about 0.1 yuan. Broken japonica rice had a slightly better appetite, and the situation stabilized. Yang Du Bu Jian and other price models were 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. The six types of kiln were unchanged in the local market, slightly softening in wholesale, with prices just a little over a jiao. Yin Bian Yuan was also down a little over 0.1 yuan. The price of customer jian rice stabilized, and sales were limited. The prices of other types of rice were all weak.</p>
<h3>Siping Street Soybeans Fall — 20 Truckloads Traded —</h3>
<p>Yesterday, another 20 truckloads of soybeans from Siping Street in Dalian were ordered (about 450 bags per truck) at a price of 5.4 yuan, a decrease of 0.17 yuan compared to the previous market. Delivery is scheduled for within November by oil extraction factories. Currently, major suppliers have already provided the source. The overall future situation may be difficult to improve, so the market situation is no longer what it used to be. Sales only have the support of export guilds, and local retail traders help each other, allowing the market to stabilize. However, products are also being discounted. Yesterday, the Fuzhou guild purchased 400 bags of Huai autumn beans, 100 bags of Sha yellow beans, 200 bags of Dingjia Zhou beans, and 64 bags of Jiading beans. The Shantou guild purchased 400 bags of Dingjia Zhou beans. The Xiamen guild purchased 110 bags of Niuzhuang beans and 90 bags of Shan yellow beans. The local street traded over one hundred bags of Du beans and other beans.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing, Quiet for a Long Time, Finally Opens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained weak. The guild set the price of No. 24 coarse granulated white spot goods at 21.6 yuan, down 0.05 yuan. Re-exported goods were 6.2 yuan, unchanged. No. 4 Dongbai spot goods were 21.6 yuan, down 0.08 yuan, and No. 8 was 11.3 yuan, down 0.05 yuan. The rest were quoted at the original price. The local factory's cotton white was also unchanged. No. 1 goods had the Chao guild offering a mentioning price of 13.85 yuan for green, and Huanggang green at 13.56 yuan, totaling several hundred bags. The Guang guild offered over one hundred bags of ordinary Shilong red at a price of 13.9 yuan, which was slightly looser than before. Miscellaneous road green was not opened due to disagreements on price. The market outlook temporarily lacked hope due to sluggish actual sales.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Quanzhou Large Longan Up Six Yuan</h3>
<p>The Quanzhou (i.e., Jinjiang) Longan Industry Guild sent a public telegram to various firms in the city yesterday, stating that the production area of large longan has already risen by 96 yuan. However, at this price, it must be about 3 yuan higher than the Shanghai market price. It was found that the goods arrived on the Yong Sheng Wheel on the 24th, with large longan accounting for more than 60%. Therefore, small and medium-sized goods still feel insufficient. There is an oversupply of large longan. It seems difficult to reach the production price limit for the time being. Yesterday, the company decided to negotiate the price of the high-grade product first today to see if a deal can be made. There is still no certainty.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Origins of Active Silk Sales in America and France</h3>
<p>Yokohama Raw Silk Price Increase Becomes Increasingly Prominent: Lack of silk raw materials is a regret. The recent successive increases in silk prices are like soaring into the sky. According to a Western merchant, it is because the political situations in the two major silk consuming countries of America and France have become increasingly stable. Since the French currency devaluation and the conclusion of financial agreements with Britain, the United States, and other countries, the French exchange rate has gradually stabilized, and the domestic economy has gradually recovered. Therefore, the Shanghai French Bank had little to show for the past two months, but recently, inquiries have been increasing, no less than the American banks. Because the presidential election in New York is about to end, and the political position of the president may remain unchanged, general commerce is not as stagnant and hesitant as it was a month ago. Actual silk sales are therefore active, and Yokohama is taking the opportunity to raise prices, which are becoming increasingly prominent. As of yesterday, the spot price had broken through the 800 yuan mark to 805 yuan. Such high prices are the highest record in seven months since a copy in March of this spring. At the same time, the New York near-term price surged by six points yesterday, with about 4,000 bales of silk traded. The market price, converted into Chinese currency, rose by 26.6 yuan compared to last Saturday's market price. The market sentiment is sharp, which can be clearly seen. However, its impact on the Shanghai market is that most silk factories have sold off too early, and there is insufficient near-month and spot silk to meet market demand. At the same time, dried cocoons are scarce and expensive, making it difficult to obtain them, which has created a shortage of raw materials. Therefore, the Shanghai market was extremely chaotic yesterday. Silk merchants' asking prices were extremely high and unpredictable. For example, White Factory's B-character RR was held at 750 yuan, while the average price was close to the 800 yuan mark, causing Western banks' silk sales to be firm but not smooth. Total sales of domestic and foreign silk totaled 420 bales.</p>
<h3>Pingshui Tea Transactions Not Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to the Tea Industry Association, the trading of various green teas such as Zhen Mei was still clear, with only Jinlong and Xiehe each handling a small number of counter-draw Zhen. However, the trading of various Pingshui teas has been quite active in recent days. In particular, ordinary products priced around 50 yuan have seen strong sales. After Xiehe handled 2,500 boxes previously, Yihe and Jinlong each took in more than 1,000 boxes yesterday, and Jinlong each traded over 1,000 boxes of No. 23 Pearl Tea, Xichun, and Zhen Mei. It was found that the inventory of this type of tea in the market has greatly decreased. The market price is lower than before by 23 yuan to 56 yuan, but the future has stabilized.</p>
<p>Another report stated that yesterday's foreign bank tea market saw slightly more active sales of road-grade Zhen Mei green tea. British merchants Yihe and Xiehe and other companies all actively handled them due to suitable prices. The entire city traded more than 400 boxes. It is reported that there are still sporadic amounts being negotiated. However, the selling price has shrunk to 4849 yuan, another drop of 23 yuan compared to before. In addition, Tongfu and Jinlong and other companies also handled sporadic purchases of Zhen Mei Xiu Mei and other goods.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt from Zhejiang Road New Goods Coming</h3>
<p>Asphalt is already nearing the new production season. Only Jiaxing, in western Zhejiang, has the worst yield this year, in stark contrast to last year's full harvest. Other places, such as Jinlan in eastern Zhejiang and Jingyi in western Hubei, have 7080% harvests. If calculated as a national average, it can still be considered a selling year. Old goods inventories are thick everywhere. The number of branches and Tianjin hemp in the desert city is between 20,000 and 30,000 pieces, and there are still many that have not been shipped out of the origin. Recently, it has been learned that sales in the Wuhan market are not very smooth. Hulled tung oil is priced between 18.46 yuan per load, and hemp oil is 16.24 yuan per load. There was a rise once a decade ago, but it has recently fallen again. The appearance of Zhejiang West cypress has already been seen. It is said that it is priced between 6.12 yuan per load. Based on this cost, the cost of Hebei oil may be above 20 yuan. Old Hebei has been sold for over 20.5 yuan. New goods have not yet opened in the Shanghai market. It is likely that due to the relationship of the yield, the price is difficult to resist, making it difficult to approach a deal. Transactions may not occur until after the new goods are produced.</p>
<h3>The Only Remaining and Unique Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>— Authored by Dr. Tissot-Daguette, translated by Dr. Chen Minbo, a graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>...After Germany and Italy Joined Hands, the Medical Community's Academic Circles Showed a Tendency to Further Cooperate on the Clinical Treatment of Gonorrhea...From the Failure of Transmembrane Sterilization to the Success of Protein Therapy, Pioneers' Entrepreneurship is Difficult...Once Gonorrhea Enters a Chronic Stage, Orchitis is Inevitable, Thus Extinguishing Future Generations and Endangering Life</p>
<p>Ever since Italy established its corporatism as a unique feature in all of Europe, and Mussolini's fascist policies shocked the world, Germany, led by Hitler, who reigned supreme in the world with his iron-fisted policies, stood alongside Italy in every aspect of its transcendent position. They shared political tastes, and they were close partners.</p>
<p>After Germany and Italy joined hands, the medical community further cooperated. They fully recognized a common treatment for gonorrhea and moved forward toward this goal. As a result, the flame of gonorrhea was greatly reduced. People who had been harmed by gonorrhea since ancient times finally got the day to look up, which can't be said not to be a unique happiness of the twentieth-century man!</p>
<p>Before this method, which was considered common by the medical community, there was first transmembrane sterilization for gonorrhea. On the one hand, that treatment was certainly not wrong, but from many perspectives, it could not be established. Because when gonorrhea is first infected, gonococci are attached to the urethral mucosa. At this time, the method of transmembrane sterilization is still useful. However, gonococci are extremely active. Once the urethra is invaded, they inevitably enter the bloodstream, so even if the treatment is transmembrane sterilization, in fact, gonococci are already distributed in the body and blood. At the same time, the testicles and prostate, and even the bladder joints, will develop inflammation. The testicles swell and harden, and if not cured, they will be infertile for life. If the joints are sore, then there is the possibility of developing disabling gonococcal arthritis. Therefore, regardless of whether gonorrhea is in the early or chronic stages, the only fundamental solution is to eliminate gonococci or toxins from the entire body, and to achieve this goal, one must take "Kelinong." Because this is a drug made from a combination of proteins and yellow pigments. Protein has the ability to stimulate the entire body's anti-gonococcal antibodies and increase the number of white blood cells, so that it can perform the great function of sterilizing. Only protein has such an effective use, and yellow pigment is only diuretic and anti-inflammatory. The characteristics and special effects of "Kelinong" lie in this. Other chemicals and imitations of "Kelinong" made by mixing yellow pigment with other ingredients are truly ridiculous in their crudeness and shallowness.</p>
<p>According to the clinical experiments of our country's gonorrhea experts, "Kelinong" is a good medicine for treating all acute and chronic leucorrhea in men and women, and it has no adverse irritation. Taking it for inflammation of the testicles and prostate can still lead to normal fertility. Gonococci are permanently eradicated! For women's leucorrhea, it is best to use "Karexidi" externally at the same time as a suppository, which will make it even better.</p>
<h3>New Techniques for Controlling Your Wife: Difficult Male Problems to Solve</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical Department</p>
<p>Dedicated to Young Lovers with New Weapons, Dedicated to Cowardly Men Whose Husband Rights Have Declined</p>
<p>Men in today's society can be said to have extremely important and complex responsibilities. We should enrich our own strength, especially physical strength. For example, a man who is physically weak and has sexual dysfunction will feel very depressed about sexual problems. Because of sexual dysfunction, mental fatigue, sexual dissatisfaction, headaches, insomnia, forgetfulness, palpitations, anemia, and aging appearance, these can all be said to be fatal injuries for men. But there is something even more serious. It is the sexual dissatisfaction that causes the wife's disgust. The man, knowing that he has defects himself, has to be accommodating in everything, which not only causes the husband's rights to decline, but also makes his wife arrogant, resulting in a divorce. This kind of depression is deeply felt and experienced by every person suffering from a sexual disease. In addition, sexual dysfunction also causes difficulties with the issue of children. So how should we save it and break through this difficult situation? Then we have to properly treat the overall situation.</p>
<p>From the actual treatment of thousands of examples, we know that most of this kind of male sexual dissatisfaction is caused by masturbation during the puberty stage, which also deals a major blow to sexual function, cutting it off halfway. As a result, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and premature ejaculation follow. In particular, the underdevelopment of the lower body is the most serious obstacle to male love. French Dr. Mureau once said that for such an unfortunate group of men, the thymus gland must be fundamentally and thoroughly corrected. And according to my experience, the most appropriate drug to take on this important task is "Buticon," a special effect medicine for neurasthenia, because this medicine is made with hormones from brave animals. It can invigorate the endocrine system of the sex glands, promote the development of reproductive function, and consolidate the function of the thymus gland. All sexual neurasthenia can be cured. As for those with nocturnal emission, "Ners Night Emission Tablets" can be taken at the same time to strengthen the essence gate, and it can also be eradicated. At the same time, the male's difficult problem is also solved. "Buticon" is indeed a weapon for love.</p>
<h3>Another Case of Arthritis Cured</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Patient Zhao Junwen, 27 years old, contracted gonorrhea at the age of 23. Although he continued to receive treatment, he rarely saw any effectiveness, and the joints of his legs, knees, and scapula also felt slight pain. This symptom had been going on for two years. He asked me to treat him. The diagnosis showed that the arthritis was swollen, like a honeycomb, and countless gonococci were attached to it (see Figure A). In addition to using anti-gonorrhea serum and electrotherapy, he also took "Kelinong". After five weeks of continuous treatment, the inflammation and swelling completely disappeared, the joints moved freely, and the shape of the joints also returned to normal. The gonococci disappeared (as shown in Figure B). Even with severe stimuli, it has not recurred for two years.</p>

<p>Before taking "Kelinong", the joints were red and swollen, shaped like a honeycomb, and countless gonococci were attached in between.</p>
<h3>(Figure B)</h3>
<p>After using "Kelinong", the inflammation and swelling completely disappeared, and the gonococci also disappeared.</p>
<h3>Vaginal Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>The most common disease among women is vaginal erosion, causing inflammation and pain. The origin of this disease is mostly caused by leucorrhea, because the patient has dirty liquid flowing out day and night, and the mucous membrane is eroded due to long-term infiltration. Therefore, it is most able to bring in bacteria and induce all kinds of unexpected dangers. However, many women are confused by the preconceived notion that leucorrhea is the most common symptom, so they abandon it without treatment.</p>
<p>Patients not only suffer from vaginal erosion, but also often develop menstrual irregularities and reduced fertility. For those whose leucorrhea comes from gonorrhea toxins, this leucorrhea, if it contaminates a child's eyes, often leads to blindness. The only standard treatment is to use "Karexidi Vaginal Suppositories" as suppositories. For antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, pain relief, and anti-secretion. If menstruation is already irregular, "Bunu Rong" can be used as an internal medicine. For those with gonorrhea, "Kelinong" can be used as an internal medicine. Taking care of both inside and outside is the most fundamental treatment.</p>

<p>Regular Treatment for Acute Gonorrheal Urethritis</p>
<p>In the past, suppressive therapies or local transdermal sterilization methods were often used for acute gonorrheal urethritis. Now, it is known that these treatments are ineffective. Although gonorrhea is initially in the anterior urethra during the acute phase, the cunning gonococci often take the opportunity to rush into the posterior urethra due to surgery or other improper washing methods. Therefore, even if the gonococci in the anterior urethra are completely eradicated, the gonococci in the posterior urethra will scatter, causing the inflammation to spread, resulting in various complications, and the acute gonorrhea becomes chronic. Chronic gonorrhea then turns into severe conditions. Therefore, world-renowned physicians unanimously agree that regular treatment should be administered. The so-called regular treatment involves internal administration of German "Klinon," supplemented with short and long radio waves, to exert the special anti-gonorrheal and bactericidal effects of "Klinon." This drug can generate anti-gonorrheal toxins and clear bacteria and toxins in a short period after administration. Therefore, no matter where the gonococci spread, they can be tracked down and eradicated.</p>
<p>I have consistently used this regular treatment to cure countless cases of gonorrhea. Mr. Zhou Zhiguo, residing on Henan Road, initially suffered from gonorrhea and, due to incorrect and irregular treatment, his inflammation intensified, threatening to affect the posterior urethra. Later, he purchased my book "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" at the Dadong Bookstore on Fuzhou Road and learned that I am skilled in treating this disease. He sought my treatment. After a rigorous diagnosis using scientific methods, it was determined that Mr. Zhou's condition had indeed turned into posterior urethritis. Although the swelling and pain had slightly subsided, the gonococci had already penetrated deep inside. He experienced great difficulty in urination, with pus and blood flowing out from time to time. He was treated with short and long radio waves. On one hand, he was given "Klinon" to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, promote urination, and relieve pain. After taking it for three weeks, the lesions had greatly shrunk. As a result, urination became smooth, and the pain was completely relieved. However, microscopic examination revealed that there were still a few gonorrheal remnants in the urine. He was instructed to continue taking "Klinon" for another week. After re-examination, there were no gonorrheal remnants, and a serological test showed no gonorrheal reaction. It was then confirmed that he was thoroughly cured. Six years have passed since then, and there have been no changes in his condition. He also has a three-year-old son.</p>
<h3>Case Studies of Kidney Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Deng Yuanhe, Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University and Director of Shanghai South People's Hospital</p>
<p>(Clinic) Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road (Consultation Hours) 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM</p>
<p>(1) Impotence and Premature Ejaculation Cured</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Jiang Chuntao, 36 years old, from Tianjin. Reason: Married for 15 years, but has not been able to conceive. His wife is healthy and without illness, but she is always depressed and indifferent to Mr. Jiang. This is due to Mr. Jiang's impotence and premature ejaculation. Symptoms: He had committed masturbation as a young man. After marriage, excessive sexual activity gradually led to erectile dysfunction. He also experienced nerve paralysis with no sensation of pleasure. Eventually, he ejaculated upon the slightest touch and was ultimately unable to achieve an erection. Treatment: The patient was completely deficient in hormones, and his nerves lacked nourishment. He was given the hormone preparation "Butiren" internally to boost his hormone levels. Electrical therapy was also applied. Good results were achieved in less than a month. He wrote last month, saying that he happily achieved an erection around the Mid-Autumn Festival and has conceived a son.</p>
<p>(2) Seminal Emission and Masturbation Recovery</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Yao Zhongqian, 21 years old. Business sector. Reason: Induced by bad friends at the age of thirteen, he developed a masturbation addiction. Symptoms: Dizziness, insomnia, forgetfulness, nocturnal emission every night, frequent erotic dreams, facial flushing, and physical weakness. Treatment: "Nairs Seminal Emission Tablets" were first prescribed to treat his seminal emission, and "Butiren" was used to restore his weakened condition, resulting in a sudden recovery.</p>
<h3>Essential Guidelines for Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>...Nervous breakdown is unavoidable when quitting smoking...Forced quitting of smoking may lead to the recurrence of latent illnesses.</p>
<p>Speaking of quitting smoking, it is not an easy task. Although there are many smoking cessation products on the market, they all address the symptoms but neglect the root cause. Therefore, although they can be effective temporarily, they also cause severe pain. Examining the truth, these smoking cessation methods only focus on clearing tobacco toxins and neglect to nourish the body. Or they are nominally nourishing the body, but in reality, they only stimulate certain glands in the body. It must be understood that in smokers, over the years, hormones in the body are destroyed, and the nerves lose nourishment, leading to weakness. Without the stimulation of tobacco toxins, symptoms such as yawning, seminal emission, and insomnia occur frequently. Therefore, the most effective and latest smoking cessation method takes boosting hormones as the only condition. This is why the hormone drug "Butiren" is unanimously praised by smokers. Mr. Niu Mulin, residing in Xiaoximen, had been smoking for more than ten years and suffered from symptoms such as impotence, premature ejaculation, seminal emission, and insomnia. When he tried to quit smoking, his old symptoms recurred, and he could not satisfy his addiction unless he smoked two qian (unit of weight). After I prescribed "Butiren" and instructed him to take it for about a month, the tobacco toxins were resolved, and the underlying ailments were eradicated. Furthermore, he was full of energy, had a rosy complexion, and became stronger every day.</p>
<h3>New Success in Conception Techniques</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>Contraception techniques have not yet succeeded, but conception techniques are now within grasp.</p>
<p>There are often things in the world that seem unfair. For example, children are one of them. Many people do not want to have sons, but they keep having them, making the mother and child weak. Many people try all sorts of ways to have children, but they still cannot achieve their goal. How unfair is this! However, although contraception techniques have not yet succeeded, conception techniques are now within new grasp and have been discovered by all-powerful science. In many cases of women who have stopped conceiving, practical examinations have shown that the reason why women cannot conceive is mostly due to abnormal ovarian function, irregular menstruation, lower abdominal pain, constant vaginal discharge, chlorosis, neurasthenia, and hyperactive heart function. Everything loses its normal form. It is only natural that they cannot conceive.</p>
<p>If we want to completely treat these obstacles to conception, we must adjust these abnormal functions. For example, if we take "Bunu Rong," the result is that 94-95% of women conceive. The other 5-6% stopped treatment halfway through due to other reasons. This is the latest success of scientific conception. Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union encourage childbirth, so conception drugs are very popular. Italy and Russia both explicitly exempt them from import duties to facilitate people's purchase and consumption. However, those with leukorrhea should use "Carl Shendi Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories to cleanse the leukorrhea. This is even more appropriate.</p>
<h3>A Word for Stomach Patients</h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu</p>
<p>Remedies for indigestion; patients with chronic stomach sluggishness must also take tonics.</p>
<p>The organs responsible for digestion in the human body, in addition to the oral cavity, salivary glands, teeth, and esophagus, mainly include the stomach and intestines. The stomach and intestines are indeed interconnected organs. When the stomach is healthy, the intestines are generally healthy. When the stomach is sluggish, the peristaltic function of the intestines must also be slow. This is why stomach patients often suffer from constipation.</p>
<p>Stomach disease is a chronic illness, so people with stomach problems often have anemia, indigestion, weakness, and a pale complexion. Therefore, treatment should not only improve the function of the gastric mucosa and harmonize the peristalsis of the intestines, but also provide abundant nutrition. "Qiangwei Jing" is a compound enzyme preparation. It not only effectively treats symptoms such as belching, acid reflux, heartburn, chest tightness, vomiting, stomach distension, and epigastric pain, but also effectively treats constipation. It also alleviates excessive intestinal peristalsis, so it can also completely cure symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Moreover, "Qiangwei Jing" also contains vitamins ABD, which not only treats beriberi caused by vitamin B deficiency, but also boosts physical strength, supplements the body's nutrients, and restores health. Therefore, if you can take it continuously, you can achieve a state of abundant blood and qi in a very short period of time.</p>
<h3>Special Treatment for Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>...One seminal emission is equivalent to losing one pound of blood...The way to save it must be fundamental and comprehensive!</p>
<p>Seminal emission is a symptom that comes with civilization. Its domain is larger in cities than in rural areas. Wealthy people are more prone to it than poor people, but most of them are still young people who suffer from it due to masturbation and excessive sexual desire after marriage. The most effective drug for treating this type of seminal emission is "Nairs Seminal Emission Tablets." This tablet has a calming effect on hyperexcitability of the nerves. Erectile nerve and abnormal central nerves of ejaculation can also be strengthened by taking “Nairs Seminal Emission Tablets.” However, if seminal emission has been going on for a long time, or is due to incomplete development and physical weakness, doctors must prescribe it with "Butiren" to strengthen the essence and nourish the brain and promote the production of new sperm cells. As a result, the symptoms of neurasthenia can be removed, and seminal emission is cured invisibly. After I graduated from Nantong Medical University, I treated a young man named Li. Because he had masturbation addiction, he already had seminal emission at the age of twenty, as well as incomplete development and other illnesses. I prescribed "Nairs Seminal Emission Tablets" and "Butiren" to be taken together. He was cured in three or four weeks. And his body is very strong. He has truly become a great man.</p>
<p>Reader's Corner</p>
<p>The following medicines are all designated by doctors who have graduated from domestic and foreign medical universities. Please make sure to identify the names of each medicine when purchasing! Do not blindly believe what others say and purchase miscellaneous inferior medicines, so as to avoid causing danger after taking them.</p>
<p>Seminal Emission and Kidney Atrophy</p>
<p>I am a young man in my prime. I suffered from severe seminal emission due to the influence of masturbation at the age of fifteen. But now I am showing signs of aging, impotence, premature ejaculation, and short sexual organs. My wife and I have no pleasure at all. Introduced by a friend, I purchased "Nairs Seminal Emission Tablets" from Wing On Company and took them. I was completely cured after about three boxes. However, my impotence has not improved. May I ask what medicine is effective? (Zhang Leqing)</p>
<p>(Answer): You can take "Butiren" to boost your hormones, which will result in growth, increased strength, and increased energy.</p>
<p>Self-Treatment for Leukorrhea</p>
<p>My wife once suffered from severe leukorrhea, lower abdominal distension, irregular menstruation, and erosion of the lower part. After I purchased "Carl Shendi" and instructed her to use it externally to treat the leukorrhea, she inserted one or two tablets into the vagina every night. The leukorrhea has cleared, but her menstruation is still irregular and she has neurasthenia. May I ask what medicine can treat this? (Wang Shuzhen)</p>
<p>(Answer): You can purchase "Bunu Rong" from the China-Western Pharmacy to regulate menstruation and strengthen the body, which will be effective.</p>

<h3>Talking About the Love Affair of the King of England</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Marriage issues are quite complicated. Not only does each country have its own marriage system, but each region also has its own marriage system. Some are polygamous, as in ancient China, and some are polyandrous, as in certain parts of Southeast Asia, where brothers jointly marry one wife. Marriage in our country used to be the so-called autocratic marriage, or a marriage for sale. The only condition for a marriage for sale was "matching social status." In other words, it was a matter of family status. What does "matching social status" mean? It means the rich marry the rich, the powerful marry the powerful, or the powerful marry the rich, and the rich marry the powerful. It can also be an example of matching social status. Now that freedom of marriage has become law, the old system has been completely abolished.</p>
<p>Recently, the great uproar in England over King Edward's love affair with Mrs. Simpson shows that the concept of social status or class in England is very deep. The British have always been known for their "gentlemanly manners," and their gentlemanly style still prevails today. Mrs. Simpson is the wife of a London stockbroker. It has recently been rumored that she is in the process of divorce and is preparing for further developments with the King in the capacity of a holiday companion. This has created a problem. It is considered a very extraordinary and terrible thing in the eyes of the British for the head of England to want to marry a commoner woman, not only a pure woman but also a married woman.</p>
<p>Thus, the King's love affair has become a very good topic of conversation. According to a London telegram on the 17th, King Edward was furious because the leaders of the political and religious spheres in England wanted to interfere in his friendship with his holiday companion, Mrs. Simpson. It is said that the Archbishop of Canterbury and Prime Minister Baldwin recently made an informal visit to Buckingham Palace to advise the King to be more cautious in his relationship with Mrs. Simpson. The King was extremely angry at their interference in his personal life, but he did not want to show it. He trembled his lips slightly and asked the Archbishop and the Prime Minister not to interfere in other people's affairs. The phrases "trembled his lips" and "did not want to show it" fully demonstrate that although the King had committed this scandalous love affair, he did not have the courage to actively resist the criticism from public opinion and the interference from politics and religion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to British telegrams, many people in England today imagine that King Edward VIII may abdicate his throne to his brother, the Duke of York, and retire to a happy country gentleman. The court claims that the talk of abdication is completely unfounded, but those who imagine this have various bases, etc. This kind of statement clearly indicates that to marry Mrs. Simpson, unless you sacrifice your throne and become a country gentleman, otherwise, in any case, you should sever the relationship with Mrs. Simpson. Should the king sacrifice his throne? Or should he maintain his love? The King should carefully choose one of the two. Although this meaning is not explicitly stated, the intention is already implied.</p>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 22nd, people close to King Edward's traveling companion, Mrs. Simpson, today declared that Mrs. Simpson really does not want to marry King Edward to avoid making things difficult for England. She also knows that the national atmosphere is not good for this matter. According to the News Chronicle, the proof copy of the previous day published a long news story that the King could marry a commoner, saying that the law allows the King to choose a commoner as his queen. However, this news was immediately deleted, which shows that even with the dignity of a monarch, one cannot marry a civilian woman. How difficult is it to remove social status!</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Mingyuan Mushroom Farm</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>(Special Report by This Newspaper) The new method of growing mushrooms is a newly discovered emerging industry in our country. Several companies in this city have already started growing them, including Sino-American, Great West, Huang's, and Mingyuan. Sino-American is said to be the earliest, and there are also many private family mushroom farms. However, because the output is still not very high, the price is very expensive, and eaters are limited to Westerners and high-end banquets.</p>
<p>The business of growing mushrooms has always existed in our country, but because the old traditional methods are used, they are often limited by weather and location, and ten types of mushrooms can only be dried. New-method mushrooms can not only be sold fresh, but the growers also make a good profit. Therefore, I think this is also a sideline worth promoting.</p>
<p>In order to learn more about the new method of growing mushrooms and the layout of the farm, I made a special trip to the Mingyuan Mushroom Farm on East Sports Association Road yesterday afternoon to conduct an on-site visit.</p>
<p>(1) A Glimpse of the Farm The farm is square, covering an area of more than ten acres, surrounded by fences. The single-story flat building in the front includes offices, reception rooms, and the food and dormitories for workers and staff. Behind it is a large open space, filled with piles of horse manure. Several workers are manipulating it. Next to it is a pile of mud. These new muds seem to be from other</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>brought from other places. The middle building is the mushroom cultivation room. To the left is a small house where water heating is located, and a water storage pavilion is right at the entrance of the heating room.</p>
<p>The structure of the mushroom room is very special. There is only one door on the wall, but it is kept tightly closed all day long. Except for things going in and out, it is usually absolutely not allowed to open; every two feet on the upper end of the wall has a small circle opening, and the same small window holes are also about one foot above the ground, and can be opened and closed to adjust the temperature and climate in the room. The room is very dark, and a kind of damp smell is filled in it; I was led in by a manager with a flashlight. Because the ground was very wet, I stepped on a board and looked around. I saw water heating pipes installed all around, and two wooden racks on both sides, with four rectangular wooden trays on them. The larger one is eight square feet each. Each plate is covered with a layer of new mud, and countless snow-white things are showing through on the mud surface, and that is the newly emerging mushroom.</p>
<p>These mushrooms are large, some are as small as fine beads, and some can only be seen as a bit of white trace on the mud surface.</p>
<p>(2) Planting Method After visiting everywhere, we returned to the reception room; at this time, the manager told us about the mushroom planting method and the source of the seeds.</p>
<p>This mushroom seed is completely purchased from the United States, but there are many types in the United States, and the prices vary. The purchase is calculated by bag, and the size of the bag is based on the standard of seeding several square feet of area. The appearance of the seeds is like brownish-gray fine ash, which can fly if blown or brushed. As for the planting method, the horse manure is first manipulated manually in the sun. After a certain number of days, the stinky smell has been completely removed, and there is no smell at all, and all the heat has completely disappeared. Then, evenly spread it in the wooden trays. After spreading it evenly, take an equal amount of mushroom seeds and scatter them on the horse manure surface, and then spread a layer of new mud that is neither too thin nor too thick on top.—This new mud, clay and sand should not be used, only sandy loam is suitable.</p>
<p>After sowing, the air in the room must be closed, and no light can pass through. The average temperature is 70 degrees, and water must be poured every day. Small mushrooms can be seen in half a month, but they grow and reproduce very quickly, so after seeing small mushrooms, you can choose to cut the large ones in three or four days, cut as you go, and if you don't cut them, they will naturally wither. In this way, you can cut and produce every day for as long as four months or as little as three months, and then you must replant.</p>
<p>(3) Production and Promotion The production volume is large, and each square foot of area can produce up to one pound of mushrooms per day. According to the current selling price, it is worth one yuan in legal currency, but it is better to reproduce during warm weather, and it is inevitable that it will be slightly inferior in winter. However, fresh mushrooms are rarely seen on the market now, and there are not many planters, and few people eat them, so the mushrooms in the farm are sold by the farm's personnel, in addition to the daily amount agreed upon by various households.</p>
<p>Fresh mushrooms cannot be exposed to wind and light, otherwise they will change color, so after cutting them from the mud, put them into boxes immediately, and they cannot be stored overnight, otherwise the color will not be very white.</p>
<p>This fresh mushroom tastes very delicious, tender, and fatty. It is not only excellent for making dishes, but also can be made into canned food. Therefore, this mushroom business has been very developed in Europe, America, and Japan, but our country has only recently had someone advocating planting.</p>
<p>Mingyuan Mushroom Planting was founded last year. Although they have sown seeds twice in the past, it is said that the results are not close to the budget. As for the results of this time, because sowing has only been more than a month, it cannot be predicted, but the results are always better than the previous two times.</p>
<p>Finally, I asked the manager again, does China have its own mushroom seeds? Can it also be grown using improved methods? Can the improved mushrooms also collect seeds themselves in the future? He said: China also has mushroom seeds, and they can also be grown using new methods, but the results are not very good. As for collecting mushroom seeds from improved mushrooms, they still don't know how.</p>
<h3>Depending on the Eldest Daughter-in-Law</h3>
<p>— Shi Xi</p>
<p>One day, Mother told everyone that Yang Haiyun had brought a twelve-year-old girl named Jinzhi to be his daughter-in-law, to be matched with his four-year-old son, Huocong. He was a tenant farmer of our Si family, and his family only had a wife and that four-year-old son. Every season, he was busy with the fields and also busy going up the mountain to make earthen farming tools. Therefore, no one took care of his four-year-old son, and no one cooked for them. So he took such a big daughter-in-law, also for this reason.</p>
<p>Not long after, the time for collecting rent arrived. Fourth Aunt and the others were going to collect rent. That day happened to be my Sunday. To pick chestnuts and persimmons, I went with her to Yang Haiyun's house. It was almost eleven o'clock, and there was no one at his house, only that eleven or twelve-year-old little daughter-in-law and her four-year-old little husband.</p>
<p>She was thin, her face was very dark, with patches of red and black, and her voice was very small. Her eyes were often wet, and her hands were rough and large. She was wearing torn and tattered clothes, with her arms, back, and chest exposed.</p>
<p>She told us that Yang Haiyun had not returned yet, and then she carried her little husband to the kitchen to cook.</p>
<p>The next-door neighbor was also our tenant farmer. A woman heard us talking, ran over to invite us in, poured tea, and cooked some cornbread for us to eat. Fourth Aunt casually asked about Yang Haiyun's daughter-in-law, and the woman sighed repeatedly, saying:</p>
<p>"What a sin, old master's family! Have you seen how Haiyun's mother treats this adopted daughter-in-law (child bride)? She beats her to death or half to death. She has to cook three meals a day, fetch water herself, and go up the mountain to gather vegetables and firewood. She also has to take care of the house and watch the children. Sometimes, if she is late cooking, Haiyun's mother steps in the door, looks at the kitchen, and if the food is not ready, she starts cursing, and at the same time, the wooden stick in her hand hits her body fiercely, almost every day like this..."</p>
<p>Before she finished speaking, we heard footsteps outside the door. The adopted daughter-in-law came in, saying that Yang Haiyun had returned and invited us to eat. We went over and sat down for a short time, and then we heard someone crying softly. We asked and learned that Haiyun's mother had started beating the daughter-in-law again.</p>
<p>Although this little daughter-in-law was so short and thin, she was very good at doing things. Every day, besides cooking, taking care of the house, and looking after her little husband, she sometimes had to go up the mountain to make farming tools. When it was harvest time, Haiyun's mother always asked her to do heavy work. Sometimes she had to carry sweet potatoes from the mountain back home, about eighty or ninety pounds. As soon as she put down the sweet potatoes, she had to carry manure and ash (fertilizer mixed with urine and ash) up the mountain. If she walked too slowly, she would be hit with a hoe. Haiyun himself couldn't stand it, but he was afraid of his wife and didn't dare to say anything.</p>
<p>One day, the adopted daughter-in-law secretly ran to Yang Zicheng's house next door to cry and complain to Yang Ersao. Yang Ersao was a straightforward person and said casually:</p>
<p>"You are so young and you get beaten twice a day, you might as well die..."</p>
<p>She secretly remembered this in her heart. When she got home, she broke a bowl and was beaten by Haiyun's mother and didn't get any food. When it was twelve o'clock at night, she secretly got up, took the opium she had hidden under her bed, and mixed it with white wine and drank it. At five o'clock, her mother-in-law called her to get up and cook breakfast. She called several times but didn't hear her answer. She thought she was fast asleep, got up, took off the quilt, and hit her hard a few times, then went angrily to the kitchen to start a fire. After she started the fire, she still didn't see her get up, so she went to call her a second time and found out that she had died from smoking opium.</p>
<p>This is what we heard the second time we went to her house.</p>
<h3>Death (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Liao Chu Xiu</p>
<p>I am still young, and my concept of "death" is very vague. I know that everyone has that day, but I always feel that "death" is very distant and vague!</p>
<p>I have also tried to find the concept of "death" in books, but what I got was nothing more than "gray" and "black," and "sleep"-like rest.</p>
<p>I think the reason why humans are afraid of death is not the pain at the time of death: because there are indeed painless ways to die in the world, and death can be used to relieve pain), but the unwillingness to be lonely. Therefore, even if someone really feels the hardship of the floating world, they are still unwilling to die decisively. "It is better to live badly than to die well," hasn't this already become a maxim?</p>

<p>Ah Q</p>
<p>Because Ah Q is a representative figure of the proletariat, he ultimately cannot but be a loyal laborer, cannot but be a lonely person with only human nature, and even cannot but be an oppressed proletarian. Also, because Ah Q is a representative figure of the uneducated class, he thinks that when doing things, it is better to be frank and tell people that he has been an accomplice in theft rather than "avoiding the issue." In love, it is better to kneel down and show her his sincere heart rather than using seductive means to win a woman's heart. In court, it is better to be a submissive lamb who is silent on the spot rather than relying on strong arguments in the hope of escaping disaster. As for the treatment and results he obtains from the environment—this is the difference between people of the propertied and propertyless classes and the educated and uneducated classes.</p>
<p>Ah Q, this loyal laborer, is always alive in the ears of the masses. He takes pride in eating his own strength and is proud of his sacred labor. He never values the wealthy who live in comfort and never belittles himself because of his humble occupation. He is an optimistic laborer who has no hope. However, the people in his environment all look down on him, mock him, and ridicule him. He retreats from the spirit of resistance through external challenges to the will of non-resistance through internal self-control. He retreats from "grabbing forward and hitting" to "glaring at the crowd," then retreats to "forcing self-comfort," and further retreats to admitting "I am an insect." But Ah Q is not advocating "non-resistanceism" after all. He is a worker of the uneducated class after all. In order to satisfy the expansion of his spirit of resistance, he vents his grievances on the weak and innocent little nun. Ah Q's attitude is also the attitude of the general respectable authority.</p>
<p>Ah Q is not only a loyal laborer, but also a single person with "humanity." He will not forget food, and he will not forget sex. Although he does not have the means and ability to seduce someone's young mistress, nor does he have a beautiful appearance to bait someone's girl, he cannot help but feel a little fluttery towards the weak and欺的小nun. He cannot help but kneel down to Wu Ma, who is "suffering from the same disease," hoping that she might be moved. But after all, he failed. Wu Ma cried and wanted to kill herself—although this was what Wu Ma meant to do to get by, Ah Q's fatal wound lies in this "must get by." Wu Ma's need to get by is caused by the environment and etiquette; Ah Q's fatal injury is caused by not knowing how to use social skills. His courtship methods are nothing more than openly "kneeling" and simply demanding "I sleep with you." Not only did his love fail, but also the labor he used to be proud of fell into the hands of Xiao X.</p>
