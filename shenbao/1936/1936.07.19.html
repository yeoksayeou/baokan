<h3 id="c7">英埃關係的前瞻 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>據最近外電。自三月上旬開始的英埃談判。進行得很順利。軍事問題已獲妥協。蘇丹問題。尙待討論。杌隉已久的英埃關係。是否可因這次談判而改善。這是值得檢討的問題。</p>
<p>要了解這次英埃談判的意義。估計英埃關係的前途。必須把過去英埃間所爭論的問題。檢討一番。過去英埃間爭論的問題雖然很多。但最重要的却不外是英國駐埃軍隊的撤退和蘇丹的管理這兩個問題。</p>
<p>一八八二年英國以四百萬鎊的代價。購得了蘇彝士運河的大部份股票。把拿破侖在埃及的勢力驅逐了。從此埃及屬於英國的勢力範圍了。一八八九年英國和埃及締結了條約。英國得在開羅和亞力山大港兩地。駐紮重兵。一切供應由埃及政府擔任。一九一四年。世界大戰爆發。英國就把埃及劃作自己的保護國。到一九二二年。才取銷了保護國的名義。宣佈埃及的獨立。可是並不把駐軍撤退。此後埃及政府屢决跟英交涉。要求撤退兩處駐軍。同時對於駐在伊斯瑪里亞保護蘇彝士運河的所謂英埃聯軍（歸英軍官指揮）也認為妨害埃及的主權。屢决要求英國。在一定的年限以後完全撤退。英國對於這些要求。在一九二七年及一九二九年的英埃談判中。曾經予以允諾。可是要求以埃及在蘇丹的讓步為交換條件。因此上决談判毫無結果。</p>
<p>蘇丹在埃及的南面。扼尼羅河的中游。產棉豐富。是英國蘭開夏的生命線。十九世紀末。英國遠征軍藉口平亂。把蘇丹佔領起來。算作自己的殖民地。名義上歸英埃共管。一九二四年。因英國駐蘇丹總督史鐵克的被刺。就述共管辦法也無形消滅。這固然是埃及所不滿的。但是英埃爭取蘇丹的然點。還在灌溉埃及耕地的尼羅河的水利。英國的政策是多種棉花。少種共他植物。要使埃及成為英國工業所用棉花的主要供給者。因此在蘇丹首都加多姆東南一百七十哩的塞乃爾。建築了一個儲水量達一萬四千萬萬加侖的水閘。以利蘇丹的棉田。尼羅河是埃及農田的主要水源。在蘇丹地面流過數百里。它的旁流因這水閘的築成。水勢就受了阻遏。埃及的耕地面積。因此减少下去。給了埃及農業極大的打擊。所以蘇丹間題。是埃及非力爭不可的生死間題。</p>
<p>由上述英埃關係的演變看來。可以說蘇丹問題不得解决。則英埃關係也無從改善。最近英國因要緩和日益高漲的埃及反英運動。不得不對埃及表示相當的讓步。委派駐埃高級委員藍溥森。和埃及代表那哈士等恊商調整英埃關係。可是到目前為止。協商已有四個月了。英國僅允把駐埃英軍的防地縮小。可見一九二九年英埃倫敦談判中英方表示願撤退埃及駐軍的諾言也不願實踐。至於蘇丹問題。又還未聞英方有所讓步。所以英埃關係的改善。不一定可以樂觀的。</p>

<h3 id="c52">中學敎育（上） <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 上海光華大學敎授廖世承</p>
<p>中學敎育的地位　我國人口有四萬萬而中學生數祇有四十萬左右（據敎育部十九年的統計高中學生有十七萬九千，初中學生有二十一萬八千），平均每千人中祇有一個中學生。中學生數與戶口數的比例既如此細小，似乎中學生的地位在社會上並不怎樣重要。但是從另外一方面看，全國的政治，軍事，法律，敎育，實業，新聞，科學，文學，藝術各界的領袖，大多數都受過中學敎育。所以一個國家軍備的優劣，財富的盈虧，政治的消長，實業的盛衰，文化的升降，直接間接都和中學敎育有關。中學敎育不發達，人民的基本訓練便不充分。所謂基本訓練，包含知識的工具和精神的陶冶兩項。因為這個緣故，各國對於中學敎育都非常重視。</p>
<p>中學敎育的來源　我國辦理新敎育，不過數十年。初辦的學堂，大都是一段制，上邊沒有繼續研究的機關，下邊沒有預備學校。前清光緒二十三年盛宣懷創辦上海南洋公學，在外院之上，辦上中兩院，開始有三段的組織。光緒二十四年（西曆一八九八年）奏定的大學章程也分為三段，有大學堂，，中學堂，小學堂三個階段。這是我國中學名稱的來源。在西洋各國，中學的名稱起來很早。在上古雅典勃興時候，已有中小學的分別了。雅典最初設立的學校，為小學校。宗旨在鍜鍊身心。養成公民高尚的道德，所以課程很簡單，祇有運動和音樂兩種。後來文化逐漸進步，社會漸趨複雜，小學敎育，不能適應當時的需要，因此有哲學學校和修辭學校或文法學校的組織。課程有文法，修辭學，辯論學，論理學，幾何等科目，和後世的中學相稱。至文藝復興時代，拉丁中學校成立，中學敎育，遂普遍於歐西各國。</p>
<p>中學敎育的沿革　我國正式的學制系統，自光緒二十八年開始。自那年起，中學的制度，經過了好幾次的變更。第一次規定的學制系統，中學四年畢業，可是沒有實行。二十九年清廷命孫家蕭·張百熙·張之洞三人會同審定學校章程通令全國實行。那次所定的學制，中學年限改為五年。至民國初年，學制系統重行變更，中學復改為四年。到了民國十年，全國敎育聯合會在廣州開會，通過新學制草案，十一年由政府正式頒布。新學制的精神，注重在中間一個階段。它把小學的年限縮短，中學的時期加長，成為六——三——三制——六年小學，三年初中，三年高中。這個制度，雖經過兩次全國敎育會議的修正，大體沒有更動，在我國新敎育史上，要算最長久的學制系統了。批評學制的人，說六——三——三制是美國的產物，不適合國情。實則初高中的分立，是各國共同的趨勢，我們可以就東西各國舉幾個例子：</p>
<p>一、英國　英國雖規定十四歲以下為受義務敎育的時期，但兒童到了十一二歲、可以參加競爭試騐、轉入三種中等程度的學校：　文法學校，偏重文理科；　「選擇的近代學校」或中央學校，雖非職業學校，但有工商的實用課程，三年或四年畢業；　「近代學校」或高級小學，偏重實用的課程，三年畢業。在這個試騐裏邊，英國的敎育家認定兒童自十一歲至十五六歲為一個特殊敎育的時期，在此時期，學生應各依個性，得到充分的發展，不應在年齡很輕的時候，就受到一種專業的訓練。所以中央學校與高級小學，實具有初中的性質。並且還有人主張在小學裏添設四年制的「初級中學部」。推廣初級中學的趨勢，在英國是很明顯了。</p>
<p>二、法國　法國的兒童，在小學讀了五六年也可轉入中學程度的學校，一種是高級小學，三年至五年畢業；一種是國立和公立中學，七年畢業。高級小學雖偏重職業的課程，但學生仍可轉入文理學校，與初級中學的性質很相似。國立和公立中學，分為兩個圓周，第一個圓周四年，第二個圓周三年。每個圓周自成一個階段，這不與初高中很相似嗎？</p>
<p>三、德國　德國的兒童進中學很早，在基礎學校讀了四年，就可轉入中等學校。不過在大戰以後，中學敎育的趨勢，在延邊分科，使各中學前數年的課程，趨於一致。「改革的文實中學」就是一個例子。所以六年制的中學，如Kealschule和居間中學Miltelschule除前數年課程與小學接近外，實具有初中性質。九年制中學的後三年，則與高中相似。</p>
<p>四、意大利　意大利的中學，通常分為兩段。第一段稱為「宗柰梭」Ginnasio或初級中學。文科中學的第一段為五年，師範學校和專門學校均為四年。第二段稱為「尼梭」Liceo或高級中學。文科中學及師範學校均為三年，專門學校及理科中學為四年。</p>
<p>五、俄國　俄國規定八歲至十七歲為普通敎育時期。這九年的普通敎育，稱為統一的勞動學校。統一勞動學校分為二科，第一科四年為小學敎育，第二科五年為中學敎育。第二科更分為前期與後期，前期三年，適當初中；後期二年，適當高中。</p>
<p>六、日本　現行的學制，中學雖規定五年，實已縮短為四年，成為變相的初中；高等學校，則和高中相彷彿。</p>
<p>就各國的情形看，趨勢上有幾個共同之點可以提出來：</p>
<p>各國都承認在兒童十一二歲至十五六歲，為一個特殊敎育的時期。</p>
<p>各國的中學敎育，均在兒童十二歲左右開始。</p>
<p>各國的中學均分為二段，類似初級中學與高級中學的組織。</p>
<p>在初中時期，升學與職業大都　雙方兼顧，分別不甚顯明。</p>
<p>由此看來，三三制並不是美國特殊的產物，而是各國普遍的趨向。國民政府成立後，各段敎育，都有長足的進步。就中學的改進來說，量的方面，十年以內中學人數由十二萬增加至四十餘萬；質的方面，如　修訂中學規程，　規定師範獨立，　擴充職業敎育，　改進中學課程，　頒布訓育標準，　厲行軍事訓練，　試行會考制度，那於中學敎育有莫大的影響。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　胡伸持　胡一臧</p>
<p>三在神戶的同胞們</p>
<p>吃好了晚飯，我們到下山町中華民國駐神戶總領事館去。這總領事館管轄着關西二十一府縣（包括大阪名古屋京都神戶四大都市在內）以及四國的僑務。館屋是二層的洋樓，簽證處和會客室都在樓下。我們進去的時候，總領事江華本沒有在館，副領事潘錦堯出來接見。潘副領事是一位英俊的靑年，在會客室里，跟我們很親切地談了兩小時。他給了我們許多關於旅行的指教。我們問起僑務，承他詳細答覆如下：</p>
<p>『神戶華僑，本來不多，自從民國十二年，關東發生地震以後，橫濱大批華僑移住到這里來，於是人數大大的增加了。民國十九年據神戶市廳調查，計有六千六百餘人，這是神戶華僑的極盛時代。等到瀋陽事變發生，此間華僑回國的很多，人數便大減了。依照最近總領事館登記表，神戶華僑其計一千七百戶，的三千八百餘人，大都經營着商業，或是做着手藝。就商業方面說，當地有華僑質易商商號七十餘家，內中如馬聘三所開設的復和裕，（經營砂糖苧蔴輸出入）周起搏所開設的新瑞興（經營棉布棉紗等輸出）規模較大，各有日金五十萬元資本。貿易商可分廣閩和三江兩大帮。做南洋方面生意的廣閩帮居多，做海產生意的三江帮居多。此外神戶還有華僑開設的雜貨商店十五家，免換錢莊九家，綢緞行商百餘人。工藝方面以洋服工人，理髮工人，廚子及油漆工人居多。神戶有洋服舖五十六家，理髮舖六十二家，料理店十三家，油漆作八家，都是華僑開設的。</p>
<p>『日本政府為救濟本國的失業起見，對於我國勞動者的取締，年復一年地嚴厲起來。現在，不但日本各地的工廠早已沒有中國的工人，就是原在日本從事手藝的華僑，如理髮工人，洋服工人，及廚子等，也還隨時受着日本警察很嚴的取締。從明冶三十二年以來，日本政府頒布了幾項取締外人勞動及外人入境的法令。（註）凡是新來的中國人，要住在日本，非有保證人擔保不在日本從事勞動，便不能上岸。現有的華僑理髮工人和廚子，概須向官廳領取護照，每年掉換一次，如果官廳方面把護照停發，就非停業不可了。』</p>
<p>『去年名古屋發生過一件取締華工的糾紛，江總領事親自到那里去調查了一次。那批華工不會獲得官廳的許可，是日本工頭暗中招雇了去，專榦運煤的苦工的。原來日本工頭很喜歡雇用中國小工，他們比日本工人更吃得起苦，雖然受着苛酷的待遇，每天只賺到三四十錢，還是可以餘下錢來，寄回本國去。可是自從那一次糾紛發生了以後，名古屋已經沒有中國小工了。』</p>
<p>我們問到神戶華僑的團體和學校，承潘副領事答覆道：『神戶有神阪中華會館一所，歷史很久，性質跟內地的善堂相似，辦理着僑民的慈善事業。會館房屋是華僑集資建造的。常年經費除由會館出租的房地產的租金（每年的三千元）撥充外，隨時向當地僑商募集着。前幾年我國大水災，中華會館會經有大批捐欵匯到國內去，可見神戶僑胞對於祖國的關切。現在會館理事共二十三人，公推一人為理事長，照例由廣東福建三江三帮輪流擔任着。此外團體還有神戶廣業公所，神戶三江商業會，神戶福建商業會議所，神戶華商南洋輸出協會，神戶華僑洋服組合，神戶華僑理髮業聯合會，神戶華僑塗業公會（卽油漆工會），兵庫縣華商綢業公會，神戶皖江聯盟會，神戶華廚義聯會，神戶中國慈善會等。至於華僑所辦的學校，現在只有小學兩所。神戶華僑同文學校，因九一八事變停辦過一年，內分小事及幼稚園兩部，現有教職員十四人，學生四百餘人，校長是鄭翰光君。神阪中華小學，是歸三江公所管理的，有教員七人，學生二百餘人，校長是董公勗君。』</p>
<p>潘副領事又談到神戶方面對華輸出的貿易：『根據着領館的簽證貨單，每月從神戶輸運到中國去的貨物，統扯在日金兩百萬元以上，其中輸出到上海去的的有一百餘萬，貨物種類以棉紗海產品和紡織品居大宗。』當然，實際上神戶的對華輸出遠不止道個數量，因為偷漏我國關稅的所謂特殊貿易，正在一天發展一天呵。</p>

<p>（二十一）鍾祥災後農村景象</p>
<p>鍾祥濱臨漢水、盛產米棉、為本省農業精華之地、近因遙堤潰決、重罹水災、黃台之瓜、一摘再摘、農村凋敝、遂與其他各縣、等量齊觀、記者履勘遙堤後、復為全縣農村考查、見往日繫華、已成陳跡、念復興之難，而破壞之易、不禁感慨係之矣、</p>
<p>該縣分山湖河三鄉、山鄕之田、肥　互見、宜種稻　、湖鄉河鄉、除低窪及沙漢外、皆為沃壤、宜種芝蔴·棉花·大荳·大蔴·高粱等、以山鄉之稻、出產最豐、年達二百餘萬擔、大批運輸出境、或從洋梓口、出池河口、或由崩頭康出利河口、以達襄河、皆極便利、豐樂河。黃莊廟·塘港、亦為運米出境碼頭、秋收之後、帆船如織、十之六七運米、餘運棉花。芝蔴、農村為純粹之農業社會、農民以種田為主業、不兼營畜牧漁獵、故其生活之資源、全恃農產之收益、近數年來、常值豐收、生活較為安定、其所扭負之捐稅、上田每畝正賦一角二分、附稅七分、畝捐一角、保甲費五分、合為三角六分、中田每畝正賦八分、附稅六分、畝捐一角、保甲費五分、合為二角九分、下田每畝正賦六分、附稅四分、畝捐一角、保甲費五分、合為二角五分、因地之肥沃、定賦之多寡亦頗平允、農民日出而作、日入而息、勤勞所得、足供衣食、在農村破產普遍化之環境中、居然家給人足、非地力不能及此也、</p>
<p>農產豐收、一以土地肥沃、一以灌溉便利、然因濱臨漢水、頗虜水災、幸有大堤、足資保障、不料去秋大水、襄堤之潰、卽在鍾境、三四工·十一工等、共潰十八口、護城堤潰三口、中段北段之民堤、復全部崩潰、漢水挾建瓴之勢、長驅直下、受禍之烈、直破歷來紀錄、計被淹面積一萬一千四百餘萬里、佔全國積百分之二十四、被淹田地七零　六三七畝、佔十分之五、沙壓田地二二三三一零畝、房屋沖倒五零一一四楝、人口死亡二二零八二人、災民三一八三二零人、農產牲吝之損失、更難計數、遭此空前浩刦之後、元氣凋傷、而股匪邱齋公·梅道仙·向有耀等、乘機蠢起、團隊宋德文等、繼之譁變、飢民流氓、復勾成一氣、攔刦船隻、頓成紊亂之局、雖經縣長熊道琛、創平變亂、治安賴以維持、而農村之精華垂盡矣、</p>
<p>今春、全國經濟委員會、修築長達四十餘華里之遙堤、皆在該縣境內、本屬以工代賑、救濟災民、初因管理不善、到工就賑之災民、終日勞動、不能自糊其口、相率逃亡、又經聯保主任保甲長等、迫令到工、民間大受騷擾、迨至五月二麥已熟、因修堤之故、不准　割、新禾亦無暇栽種、猶以堤工將竣、可以永慶安瀾、不料是月二十六日、遙堤潰决、水勢汹湧、堤外縱橫數十里、頓成一片汪洋、堤內大部份亦被淹灌、人民服役堤上、不克分身搶救、己熟麥豆、概被淹沒、老弱婦孩、多遭溺斃、總計受災面積的三千方里、受災戶口一萬七千戶八萬三千人、較之去歲巨災、自所不逮、而農民痛苦、則甚於去年、蓋去歲災後、農村一無所有、不惜多方典借、始獲春耕、麥苗荳苗、無一非農民血債、今復被洪水沖沒、而新禾未種、秋收同告絕望、不獨將來耕種、再無舉債能力、卽目前簡單生活、亦無法維持、草根樹皮、現已成為珍品、該縣毘連隨棗、匪類出沒無常、今再罹浩刦、敦樸之農民、終將挺　而走險、此識者所為深慮也、（發於鍾祥）</p>

<p>蔡氏報告</p>
<p>首由主席蔡元培報告、略謂、章氏幼年情形、本人不甚深知、某年、余由杭去臨安、過餘杭、始初識章氏、時年二十有餘、方作訄書也、辛丑、章卽去髮辮、徜徉過市、復倡排滿革命之說、鄰里側目、章氏太炎之名、實慕明末淸初學者黃太沖·顧炎武·之為人而取、時杭州有經世報者、章常著論辱罵政府、鼓吹革命、終因環境關係、未久、卽來上海、為蘇報民報撰稿、迨蘇報案發、章及多人被捕、他人卽經營救出獄、惟章以「駁康有為書」中、有罵光緒為「小醜」字樣、經判禁西牢三年、、與陳蛻庵同獄、余時往探視、並遞送書籍及零用錢、出獄時、章剃一光頭、人謂恐風吹傷腦、章笑曰、刀尚不怕、烏論風吹、乃東渡日本、、在東京講學、聽者均年長於章、而國學根蒂甚深者、一時對留東學生影響茶大、復在北京大學及現中央大學中國文學系教授中、不乏章氏彼時之高足、中年而後、猶不忘情政治、對時局時通電發表主張、近年復致力講學、惜未竟全功、而遽歸道出、殊使人懷念不置云云、</p>
<p>潘氏致祭</p>
<p>繼由吳市長之代表潘公展致詞、略謂，（一）吾人追悼章氏、應無愧章氏在滿淸末年提倡革命之精神、（二）國人素有引用大師名號、以自詡者、實則大師應為衆所公認、如章氏始得謂一代師宗、深盼其高足能發揚光大、樸學及其精神、（三）革命命思想行動、應相輔而行、章氏既開近代思想界之先河、復與革命行動合而為一、應為吾人模範、</p>
<p>汪氏演說</p>
<p>繼由中大教授在東　（係章氏弟子之一）演說、略謂、太炎先生、常以三人自比、（一）為顧亭林、但余覺有過之無不及、蓋顧為明末學者、矢志不屈猶易、章氏生時、已在淸代建國二百餘年後、而依然能保持其不屈精神、實為吾國民族堅强抵抗外來侵略之最好例證、（二）為劉靑田（基）襄贊明主大業、光復中國、章氏對之、可無愧也、建立民國之功不可沒者有二人、一為中山先生、一卽為章氏、淸末民族思想之勃興、章氏實為主要之鼓吹人也、（三）為王充、章氏作訄書、共革新及懷疑精神不可及、惟後來思想略有轉變、自謂抑孔顏、實為推倒康梁謬說而起、章氏未食淸栗、但在民國曾兩度作官、一為袁世凱時代任東三省籌邊使、未二月卽離任、一為大總統府時代之秘書長、章氏在民元卽有其遠大目光、以東三省籌邊事、為我國國防當務之急、晚年在蘇講學、手訂章程、為期兩年竟一年而逝世、殊可悲痛云云、</p>
<p>家屬答謝</p>
<p>最後由章氏子導、及壻朱鐸民、登台、代表家屬、行三鞠躬禮、答謝來賓、復對主祭團拜謝、始奏樂禮成</p>

<p>— 何濟儒</p>
<p>現在的敎育家沒有不注意學生出路問題的、因為學生的出路是敎育效能一種重要的標記、特別是中等敎育家、對於畢業生升學或就業問題、更為關心、因為中學生感覺這兩個問題最深切、而適當的解決、又關係整個敎育的效能更大、所以提倡指導的、對於中學生的升學與就業指導、更加注意、</p>
<p>中等學校學生的出路不外兩條道途、升學與就業、職業學校與師範學校的畢業生、按理想說、理想說、自然都應就業、但事實上總有少數、因為種處關係、改變職業的計劃、謀求高深的學識、所以亦有升學的問題、至於普通中學本是備學生升學的但畢業生中總免不了有種種困難、不能升學、而需入社會謀生的、所以就業問題、亦依然存在、這兩個問題性質連貫、並且有些解決的原則、是共同的、所以可以合併討論、</p>
<p>自從敎育部在二十二年公布「中小學升學及就業指導辦法」以後、各地對於指導工作的注意、增加許多、有許多學校正在努力的實施、遵照部定的要點進行、但能將辦法中所舉事項均完全實行的、恐不多見、亦或許沒有、（關於中等學校實施指導狀况、中華職業敎育社正在調查中、）實施指導有相當成效的、自然有些學校、但沒有什麼結果的、恐亦不少、成績不多的原因、大約由於幾種不正確的觀念、</p>
<p>一、敷衍應付　有的實施指導工作的、並沒有認淸這種工作的重要、抱實施的决心、敎育行政機關旣有命令、不得不敷衍應付、以塞職責、或是組織委員會、或是法行演講、或是有別處活動、都不過為在呈報時有可叙的材料、對於學生的指導、並未得要領、切實施行、所以結果膚淺、幾等於零、</p>
<p>二、點級宣傳　有些敎育負贈人對於指導工作本無何研究、未能了解其意義及重要方法、但聽見有人提倡指導工作、以為新穎、或看見別校舉辦指導事業、引起競勝心理、所以亦來添辦一點指導的活動、以為點綴及宣傳的資料、至於學生所得的實益、不能顧到了、</p>
<p>三、臨時急救　有的敎育家以為指導的工作、專為將近畢業期間一種臨時救濟的工作、到了畢業期近的時候、學生出路問題迫急、引起了對於指導的注意、舉行演講、接洽介紹、調查高級學校情形、不得不忙一陣、但是過了畢業期間、又將這事放在旁邊、以為無關重要了、</p>
<p>以上幾種觀念、自然都因為對於指導工作根本沒有認淸意義與性質、對於指導的實施事項、未能分別重要與價値、如果這樣相沿下去、指導工作不會發生效力、得到進展、所有的提倡、都成為空談、所有的實施、都成為盲目的、為矯正上面所舉幾種不正確觀念、有幾項關於指導的原則、應在此特別提出、</p>
<p>一、指導是敎育的一部　升學或就業指導、往往以為是正式敎育以外的工作、實在講來、指導卽是敎育、學校實施敎育、為得是培養人才、如果求學生不能得到正當的深造、謀生的不能得到相當的職業、敎育的效率可算完全消失、所有敎育的活動、都沒有意義、所以指導工作必與其他敎育活動相輔而行、成為同樣重要的部份、</p>
<p>二、指導是平日的工作　升學與就業批導、都是應付出路時需要、而出路問題表面上又是屬於一時的、所以有人以為指導工作亦是有節季性的、每屆署假舉行一次卽足了、出路的實行解决、雖在將近畢業的時候、但指導的成功、全在平時的設施、决不是臨陣磨槍可以得到的、因為解决升學或就業問題、必須明瞭學生個人的已往及現在的情形、及學校與職業的狀况、並且處置的方法、有許多需長期準備、不是臨時能完成的、所以指導工作是長期的、繼續的、與平日敎育同時並進的、</p>
<p>三、指導是着重個別處置的　指導工作的方法、就組織而論、可分為團體的分個別的、對多數人施行共同的指導、如刋物、演講等、都可說是團體的、按個人的情形與問題、分別處置的、可稱為個別指導、團體指導雖不能認為沒有效力、但如果不以個別指導補充、能得結果極少、個別指導是工作的中心、不能减除、所以是應特別着重的、</p>
<p>認定了這幾項原則、對於前而所舉的幾種不正確觀念、自然可以矯正、其他的原則、可以不必在此討論、但認淸了指導的意義及重要以後、究竟應如何實行呢、為解决學生升學就業問題、究竟有些什麼事是應當實行呢、這個問題的答案非常廣泛、並並且在敎育部所定的辦法大綱中、已經舉列許多極為周密、本文中不預備供獻　完全的答案、祗就中等學校為輔助演生解决升學與就業問題、幾種基本的工作、加以簡單的說明、（未完）</p>

<p>— 謝澐</p>
<p>小朋友，一年容易，又是暑假，你們暫時離開了慈愛的先生和同學，而回到家中去，在這悠長的兩月中，我想你們一定會感覺到十分的寂寞，所以我現在替你們擬一個暑假工作的計劃，以度過這兩月的光陰。</p>
<p>第一個計劃；宣傳國難，我們中國目前危急的情况，已經到了千鈞一髮的時候，因為敎育的不普及，佔全國人口百分之五十的農民，還是漠無所知，小朋友，你們在暑假閒暇的時候，應該組織一個小先生團，把你們所知道國難的情况和救國的方法，去向鄉間農民宣傳，以你們誠懇天眞的態度，一定會激起他們救國的熱忱！</p>
<p>第二個計劃：鍛鍊身體，夏天是我們戶外生活的時期，也正是鍜鍊我們身體最好的機會，像冷水浴和球類運動，都是能夠使我們身體十分的健康，康健之精神，寓於康健的身體，願小朋友勿忘此語！</p>
<p>第三個計劃：溫習舊功課，到了暑假，你們所學習的功課，已經告一段落，秋季開學時，又將踏上另一新階段，「溫故乃能知新」，你們過去所讀的功課都是你們基本的學問，應當時時溫習，才能熟極生巧，應用目如，不致感到升學的困難了！</p>
<p>小朋友，以上三個小小的計劃，請你們努力去實行吧！</p>
<h3 id="c180">俄國文豪高爾基的童年 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>上月十八日，俄國文豪高爾基，在莫斯科附近某村中，溘然長逝了。高爾基是蘇維埃的革命文豪，也是全世界文化界所推崇的人物，我們得到了他的死信，無不哀悼。小朋友們！天天看報的兄弟姊妹，或許知道他是患了流行病而死，但關于他童年時代的生活情形，作一個簡單的報吿，更把他畢身的事略，介紹於后：</p>
<p>高爾基的父親是一個木匠，名呌麥仙皮西科失，母親是洗染衣服店裏的女兒，名呌佛發拉嘉西林，住在尼斯諾伏格拉，他生於一八六八年三月二十八日，原名阿勒賽皮西科夫，後移家至阿斯脫拉罕·五歲的時候，他的父親就死在這裏，同時又生弟，名物化，後隨母轉嫁，在校中受盡侮辱，十歲時母親又死了，遂由外祖父介紹到一家鞋子店學生意，因吃不慣苦，逃了回來，再由外祖父薦到繪圖師家裏帮傭，繼充手工舖學徒，十一歲又逃回來，十二歲流浪到伏加爾河船上做小工，認識了廚子史默利，給予巨量的書籍，供他講讀，得到不少利益後因同事間的妒忌，誣陷他做賊，便又失業了，復到繪圖師家裏，曾被打傷，十三歲時到神像店去當學徒，十四歲要到波斯去，在途中，遇到從前的繪圖師，帮他做造屋的監工，十五歲到喀山，要想進大學，沒有成功，在狂風暴雨的坍屋中，曾餓了一夜，後到糕餅店做工，曾為了戀愛的事而用了手槍自殺，傷及肺部，一個月才愈，這時才大澈大悟，便到火車站上做守夜，後又到律師處做書記，一八九二年，他已經二十四歲了，以第一次的小說，「麥卡邱特拉」發表於當地高加索日報，用他第一次的單名—高爾基—在文壇上漸露頭角，曾任小報編輯，文章頗得一般人的同情，在革命時期中，主持過新生活日報，歷盡艱難，先後共著書一百幾十部，享年六十有八歲。</p>
<p>現在他是蘇維埃中央執行委員，像這樣的一個窮人家出身的孩子，而能造成今日的地位，諸位小朋友們！想想看，高爾基是一個最偉大的藝術家；實行家；及熱誠的革命家；文學家；為全球人士最完美的「典型人物·」他眞是够人欽佩和崇拜的人啊！</p>

<p>— 仲美</p>
<p>勇兒在暑假中「天天除了寫大字小字和翻書本以外，餘下的時候，一些沒有事做，很是寂寞，於是想去拜訪他的幾位小朋友。這一天的下午，天氣非常好，他先到小朋友敏兒家中去遊玩，兩人談談說說非常快樂一會兒，走到敏兒家的園子裏，養着雞，鴨，鵝，鴿，羊，牛，在左面木欄中養着兩隻灰黑色的小猴子，勇兒很是歡喜，於是問敏兒道「這兩隻猴子那裏來的，怪可愛」！敏兒答道：「是爸爸送給我的據爸爸說它們產在我國中部，離開這裏有很遠的路程哩」。</p>
<p>「那麽它們吃些什麽東西」？「它們喜歡吃果實和昆蟲並不像貓是專食肉的動物」。「它們的牙齒是怎樣的」，「它們的牙齒和人的牙齒相像，可以分為三種·臼齒·形狀頂端扁平而闊，極適於磨碎食物·犬齒形狀是尖圓形適於撕碎食物·門齒·形狀是扁平適於切食物的」。「它們和人類有何不同的地方」？「它們和人類不同的地方簡括說，分為幾點：人的顏面骨比猴子的顏面　較大·人的口吻不向外突出而猴子的口吻是向外突出的，人無尾，猴子有極短的尾，並且人不會棲登樹上，臀部沒有胼胝體，頰無頰囊；但是猴子因為有利爪能棲登樹上·臀部有胼胝體頰有頰囊，頰囊是暫時貯藏食物的地方」。「那麽它們和人類有什麼相同的地方呢」？「它們和人類相同的地方，也可分為幾點，人類須要有母體的乳哺育而成，並且有四肢，各具有五指，有五隻扁平的爪，而前肢能握物，在胸部有乳房一對，耳殼都扁平，大腦極發達，上述幾點，猴子也同樣具有的」。</p>

<p>——暑期中的玩意</p>
<p>（一）　兒在暑假中沒有事，說事要幫助家中生產；因此，他一早便上山採柴。劈了好一會，覺得疲倦了，便想休息休息。</p>
<p>（二）肥兒也要幫助家中生產，所以他也一早便到山上打獵去，他是用一根繩的，所以好久也捉不到一樣東西。</p>
<p>（三）他看了榮兒出神地又得意的坐着休息，暗中想：「我來套住他看！」便把繩拋了過去。</p>
<p>（四）果然，榮兒被套住了，他拉緊着繩，笑著說：「捉住了一個人！」不想正說完這句話，他忽然朝天的跌了一交！原來他拉緊了繩，繩便被劈柴的刀切斷了！</p>
<h3 id="c183">快樂健康的假期生活 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 沙鷗</p>
<p>健康的父母，必能注意養成健康的兒女。不健康的父母，更要注意兒女身體的發育。</p>
<p>一般中等家庭做父母的人，因為職務的繁忙，家事的牽累，終歲勞勞，無所謂假期。雖然學校裏給了長期的休假，父母總也無暇伴着兒女們度個休閒的生活。能有幾家相伴著到廬山去，到靑島去，到普陀去，到莫干山去？不是依然關閉在那十丈紅塵，暑氣薰灼的大蒸籠裏頭嗎？</p>
<p>終年困在學校生活的兒童們，要能利用假到多作野外生活，休養了充分的健康精神，再繼續努力功課。終歲勞碌的父母，要能抽出若干日子帶着兒女們度個假期的休閒生活，恢復疲勞的神經，休養做事的精力，亨受一些天倫之樂。也正所以培養為兒女為社會服務的精神。</p>
<p>這裏舉幾條假期生活的健康規律，希望做父母的及兒童自身加以注意！</p>
<p>（一）不要使兒女衣冠楚楚地東縛着。讓他們穿着短衫短裨，自由的行動跑跳。</p>
<p>（二）適當的露營生活是健康兒童所最需要的。營地的選擇，應注意是吾宜於居住；地位是否高爽；陽光是否充足；空氣是否流通；飮料和食料的取給是否便利。</p>
<p>（三）倘到海濱或湖濱作野外生活，應該淸早動身，可以暢暢快快作整天的游息。</p>
<p>（四）海濱游息，不宜留滯得太晚，零食不要吃得太多。</p>
<p>（五）路上不要隨便喝飮井水或泉水，以防來源不潔，惹起腹瀉傷寒等病。</p>
<p>（六）特別注意食物，凡肉類，蔬菜，蛋類，水果，牛乳等，都要求共新鮮潔凈。</p>
<p>（七）過熱的天氣，不宜作過度的徒步跋涉。</p>
<p>（八）溽暑之下，不宜作劇烈的運動。</p>
<p>（九）居處安定以後，必須計劃一個有規律有變化的活動方案。</p>
<p>（十）駕車出遊，也是夏天生活最適宜的。或乘自由車，或乘無蓬的汽車，可以很舒適的縱覽野外景物，吐納新鮮空氣。</p>
<p>這樣，可以給我們一個快活，健康，有意義的假期生活。</p>

<p>— 董遜</p>
<p>小朋友：我國不是有這「緣木求魚」的一句古語嗎？然而事實上吿訴我們，樹上只有鳥，那裏來魚呢？所以大家都把這句話當作譬喻而已！</p>
<p>豈知在日本竟有這「綠木求魚」的事情！在他們千葉縣蘇我町地方的大巖寺傍邊，有一座很盛茂的森林，那兒有許多長頸長嘴的黑色　，在樹上造了巢，時常有鵜停在樹枝上休息着。因為樹上有許多的鵜，所以遍地都是鵜糞，附近居民的小孩子常到那座森林裏弄了鳥糞來作耘田的肥料；除了拾鳥糞之外，他們還要到那兒去拾魚呢！</p>
<p>我想小朋友們一定要奇怪起來了，心想樹上怎樣會有魚？這豈不是怪事？原來，那森林是近海的，樹上的鵜常飛到海裏去，捕了魚回來作食料；有時候停留在樹枝上面，一個不留神，魚兒就從它們嘴裏掙脫了溜下來，掉在地上，便給小孩子拾了去，有時小孩子還要作種種怪聲或是拍着手去嚇它們，好讓它們驚駭而突然地把魚掉了下來。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們想這種求魚的方法豈不是很別緻好玩的嗎？</p>
<p>（　是一種游禽類，能游泳水面捕魚頗巧）</p>

<p>童子軍信箱</p>
<h3 id="c186">幼童軍與小狼的結拜——答上海廣肇女學鍾家寶 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>家　弟：</p>
<p>「為什麼幼童軍稱做小狼呢？」我們相信有許多人正像你一樣地懷疑着呢。原來這新奇的稱號是那位發起童子軍的貝登堡老大哥賜給我們的。</p>
<p>從前在美洲有一種紅色印第安人，他們有一種奇怪的風俗：凡是族中人具有獨立的品格，勇敢的精神，强健的體質和助人的習慣的，族人都給他一個光榮的徽號。這徽號是什麽呢？那是我們預想不到的。這正是我們所要說的「狼」呀！非洲的黑種人也有同樣的風俗，他們都很喜歡別人稱自己做「狼」，而且能幹的小孩也稱做「小狼」呢。他們的「狼」正和我們的童子軍一樣被認為是健全的人物的。因此我們的老大哥就稱童子軍做狼，而「小狼」的尊號便戴在幼童軍的頭上來了。</p>
<p>還有一個很有趣的故事，叙述一個失踪的印度孩子在森林中和野獸們一起過活的事跡。這孩子的名字呌毛吉利，他給一隻母狼看護着，和狼羣一起過着狼的生涯。在那裏他學會了許多森林的技術，並且有一頭熊和一頭豹做他的敎師。他的一生是充滿着冒險和勇敢的事跡的。有一本書把這故事講得很有趣，我們的老大哥創辦幼童軍時就是將這書本作根據的。幼童軍有許多活動是和眞正小狼的生涯相似的，這些小狼生涯在那本書上都有很有趣的描寫。那本書名呌森林故事，作者是吉伯齡。</p>
<p>幼童軍和小狼携手的緣由就是如此。在英國是找不到「幼童軍」這個字的，他們一律稱做小狼。在中國因為先有了「童子軍」的名字，所以舉辦「小狼」時才跟着起了「幼童軍」的名稱。可是直到現在中國幼童軍的活動却和外國的小狼沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>家寳弟，你覺得「小狼」這名稱怎樣？把你的意思吿訴我們吧。請了，祝你像狼般勇敢！</p>

<p>— 東台實小五年級生王素蘭</p>
<p>光陰眞快，轉瞬間，放了暑假已兩週了。但我放了暑假，就做了先生；可說還沒有把寳貴光陰虛度。</p>
<p>太陽西沉了，一抹的彩雲，如錦繡一般在天空盤旋。晚風微微地吹來。在這時候，我的媽媽和鄰家的伯母等，都集在空塲上乘凉。我就利用這時候，敎他們識普通的生字，現在已能識五十多個字了。</p>
<p>全國的小朋友！大家起來，努力利用這長期的暑假；和我一樣的做先生吧！</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>一大抹雪白的亮光，忽地從黑暗中瀉將進來，佈滿在禮拜堂的行道中，原來那一輪明月，劃破了雲幕，高高地掛在半空裏；雪已停止了，雪光反映到裏面，似是天明時的曙光一樣。這月光直射到小南洛頭上的兩幅聖像上，和在白天躺上去時一樣的淸楚。</p>
<p>小南洛站起身來，仲出兩臂向着那兩幅聖像，快樂的淚痕在他慘白在臉上微微地發亮，他放聲喊道：『我終於瞧見它們了！呀！上帝！我一切都滿足哩。』</p>
<p>他的兩條腿終於支撑不住了。他就長跪在地上，兩眼仍然仰望着他所愛慕的兩幅聖像。月光在聖像上停留了片刻，分外的明亮，分外的淸楚，分外的甜蜜和强烈，彷彿楚從天堂上射將下來，給小南洛方便似的。驀然之間，那明光重又隱去了，黑暗罩上了耶穌基督的面部。</p>
<p>小南洛的兩臂　緊了柏德希的身子，喃喃說道：『我們到上面去再瞧他的臉吧。我想他再也不會分開我們，他老人家是最慈悲的。』</p>
<p>第二天，盎凡爾的市民在大禮拜寺的聖壇旁發見了小南洛和柏德希。他們倆都已死了。夜間的寒氣，把他們倆凍得僵硬，像石塊一般。在這耶穌聖誕的早上，牧師們到寺中來時，見他們躺在聖壇的石級上，上面羅本氏的聖像上，幕巳揭開，一道道的陽光，恰恰照着上帝的頭部。</p>
<p>後來有一個面容冷酷的老人到來，見許多婦人們哭着，他也抽抽嚥嚥的哭了起來，一面喃喃地說道：「我實在薄待了這孩子，以後我得盡力的補過，懺悔我的罪惡，他雖死了，我仍須當他是我的兒子一樣」。</p>
<p>後來又有一位世界有名的老畫師到來，向大衆說道：「我要找尋一個很有天才的孩子，昨天的那份賞金是應當賞給他的。他所畫的是在夕陽紅好的時候，一個老樵夫坐在一棵倒下的樹上。這雖是一幅很簡單的畫，然而可以瞧到他前途的偉大。我一心想找到了他，盡心的把藝術敎他，得到最大的收穫」。</p>
<p>又有一個　髮的女孩子，挽著伊父親的臂，哭得很傷心，一面放聲喊道：「啊！南洛！您來吧！我們一切都給您準備好了。我們有很多的聖誕的禮物。那個老音樂師也得給我們吹着簫兒凑熱鬧；母親也說要留您住下，過完了這聖節才回去，那時柏德希多快樂啊！呀！南洛！您快快醒來！同我們來吧」！</p>
<p>但那小南洛的慘白的臉，仰望着羅本氏的聖像上的明光，嘴上含着一絲微笑，似乎在回答他們的話道：「太遲了」！</p>
<p>甜蜜的鐘聲，在一天寒冷的空氣中，鏜鏜的響着，陽光滿照着白雪皚皚的平原。市民們很快樂的在街中結隊走去，但是小南洛和柏德希却不再來向他們乞食了。</p>
<p>他們生前總是厮守在一起，死了之後，也不再分開了。因為人們瞧見那孩子的兩臂緊緊地挽住了那狗的身子，誰也不能將他們倆分拆開來。這小村中的人，都覽得很慚愧，很後悔，特地給他們做了一回祈禱禮，又造了一個墳把他們倆躺在一起——永永的長眠下去。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c189">怎樣研究數學？ <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 德照</p>
<p>我們的世界是物質的世界；物質都是數量組成的，因之亦可以說這個世界是數的世界。我們看，自然界的山脈河流都各有其大小高低或長度，都包含得有許許多多的物質，都有很多的物質的數量；再看人類社會，如國家團體的組成都必然有許多成員，人們的一切生產和消費都必然有一定的數量；在某一點上我們可以說一切現象都可用數來解釋。至於我們的生活，那更是可以用數來計算的，如我們每月收入好多，消費幾何，每天做多少時間的工作，讀多少時間的書，休息多少時間，所有一切，可說無一不可以數來計算。一般所謂算學，數學，便是用以計算有關於自然界和人類社會以及個人生活現象的，它有實在的內容，有物質的基礎。每一個數目或數字都可以表示某種事物的數量；如二加三等於五，即是五個人或五小時或五塊錢或五個什麽東西的表現。我們可說，一切數字都有其實在的內容，否則便不會有其存在的竟義。</p>
<p>因為數量是包含在事物本身中，數學的基礎是客觀事物，而人類又不能離開客觀事物而生活，所以，數學的學習絕不是為了簡單的考試，而是與我們的現實生活有很大益處的；研究數學便是為的多獲得一些數學知識來帮助我們生活。小而言之，如我們的日常生活，假使能利用數學的知識來計劃的生產和消費，那比較無政府狀態的糊裏糊塗的生活總要好得多。俗話說得好，「穿不窮，喫不窮，不會劃算活該窮！」這就是對於不能用算學的知識來生活者的諷刺。大而言之，無論研究什麽學術，辦理什麽事情，如果有豐富的算學知識，那不僅可以使你的腦筋清楚，有條理，而且，在你的研究或處理事務中，還有許多實際的益處。</p>
<p>那麽，怎樣研究數學呢？這裏我們可以簡略地舉出幾點來：</p>
<p>第一，要研究數學，必要研究新的社會科學和哲學；因為必要具有新的思想，數學知識才能靈活地運用，也才能有所進步。我們常看到許多數學家，他們的數學知識非常豐富，但腦筋却機械得要死，什麽事情也沒有辦法。你知道，歷史上，不，就是現在，不是有許多數學家，自然科學家是迷信上帝的嗎？這對於他那科學的數理知識，很顯然地是一個矛盾表現。但這種矛盾表現的根源，便是在於他每天只知道畫X×Y或1/3或2+3等等數學式子，此外什麽事情都不管，因之也就什麽事情都不知道，養成了一個死板的腦袋。對於這樣的數學家，當然新的知識是不容易被接受的；如相對論原理，一般數學家都認為荒唐，但在事實上這原理却是最進步的。在那些沒有新思想的機械頭腦的數學家看來，四當然就只等於四，再不會是別的，可是實際上蘇聯的五年計劃在四年內就完成了，這個四的內容便是五。但這對於機械的數學者豈不是一種不通的說法嗎？</p>
<p>第二，數學對於我們的現實生活既然有着很大的用處，那我們在研究它時，便當特別注意它的實用性，不要為數學而數學。相傳紀元前二百十二年，羅馬兵攻破叙拉古城時，科學家亞基米德還在一間小屋的沙土上畫賀研究；兵入他家，他還在說不可毀滅我的圓！這是我們那些鎮靜論者同一般青年學生「訓話」時所常用的例證。依我看來，這位科學家的研究精神自然很不錯，但這樣的傾向我們却是不敢贊同的。因為敵兵既已入城，國破家亡，連自己的生命亦不能保，即使他的圓畫成功了，他那研究有偉大成績了，但那又有什麽用處呢？由於這點，我們奉勸一般學習數學的朋友，不要只是埋頭於XY或一二三四等數字中，必要隨時注意國家社會問題，必要隨時想到自己的學識的實際用處。你想，在目前中國的情形下，即使你學好了數學，還能用來為中國發展工業嗎？還能用來救亡嗎？恐怕至多也不過做一個喫洋飯的買辦了事吧。</p>
<p>第三，研究數學，必要隨時注意自己的日常生活，更必要用心深思。一個數學題放在自己眼前時，應該多費一些時間來思索，不要死用數學公式，馬上提起筆來就演算，也不要因為一時做不出就根本放棄。我曾見一位學習數學的學生遇到過這樣的一個問題：某君雇用一個娘姨，言明每月工資八元，今娘姨只做了十八天，問當給工資幾何？對於這個問題，他就依據通常的算學法則，先用三十天來除八元，企圖求得娘姨一天的工資；然後再用十八來乘除得之商，結果不是就得出了那娘姨十八天的工資嗎？殊不知以三十去除八，無論如何也除不盡，這便弄得毫無辦法。但假使能細想一番，這題是很易解答的。先是應該想，三十天該八元，那三天便當八角；隨着便想十八天是六個三天；於是八乘六，等於四十八；這便是娘姨十八天應得工資為四十八角，即四元八角。又如，樹上有六雀，舉槍擊之，一雀中彈墜地，問樹上還餘幾雀？對於這個問題，假使你毫不思索地答道，樹上還餘五雀，那就錯了，因為未中彈的五雀，一聞槍聲，即已飛去，實則樹上是一雀都沒有了。像這樣的必要用心思索的數學上的問題多得很，希望研究者要隨時留意。</p>
<p>第四，對於抽象的數學式，必要假設其具體內容來思考，才容易理解。</p>
<p>最後，當然要多費一些時間來學習；特別應該毫不畏難地多演練習題，因為這可以使你的知識豐富，演算純熟。</p>

<h3 id="c190">高橋海濱浴塲之夏 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 德照</p>
<p>自從中國出了美人魚以後，潮流的夏季娛樂和運動都轉移到游泳方面去了</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>，而况還有許多想拿眼睛吃冰淇淋的人呢？因之，每到夏天，上海市內的游泳池便有人滿之患。不特入水能游的摩肩接踵；即不入水而坐着旁觀的也大有人在。但狹小的游泳池容量有限，而且日子久了也要看厭的。因此，高橋的海濱浴塲便在許多人幻想中成為事實了。</p>
<p>我記得在高橋海濱浴塲沒有出現之前，曾被廣告吸引到一個所謂「明園」海濱浴塲去過。那是楊樹浦附近的工廠區包圍中的一個娛榮塲所。所謂海濱，只是在一個普通游泳池旁堆了不少沙泥，撑着幾把大傘，又在對過人家墻壁上繪着大幅海景而已。這種廣告式的海濱騙得你到那裏去後，真弄得人哭笑不得。</p>
<p>畢竟上海是人文薈萃之地，所以終於也可以享受到真的海水浴，而高橋這字樣便在每年夏季活躍於一班愛好游泳與游覽的人們眼裏。說起高橋，路不算不遠；它是在吳淞的對岸。但交通尚稱便利，有為遊人們特備的市輪渡專船和公共汽車專車。還有曾加人工改良的海灘與花園，池塘，土堤，亭閣等佈置，使遊人可以憇息。</p>
<p>雖然海的驚濤駭浪會給人以恐怖的想象；但海的遼闊空明，一望無際，水天溟濛，清風爽朗，也常會給人以美麗溫馨的感覺，使你留連好景，徘徊不忍去的。而高橋的海濱就是這樣。那裏有一望無垠，平沙數里的海灘。在青天白浪，强烈日光之下，散列着一個個如同蒙古包似的棚帳，你可以携朋帶友，在棚帳中襯着凉席坐在沙上，舉目遠望，簡直分不出大陸和天空，只隱約地看見遠處的風帆點點，島嶼稀疏。吐納氣息，如飲醍醐。在早晨與黃昏將近，驕陽沒有精神的時候，更是覺得凉風習習，水波不興。那時你便可以脫了衣履，穿或者游着，使你會忘記了熱和悶，使你會感覺到今年沒有夏天。同時，在海灘上還有一個好處，便是那裏的水是活動的，你儘管坐在離水不遠的去處，那由潮汐而活躍的水，它自己會一陣一陣地送到你的左右，有時還有一兩個小浪頭，像噴水池似的噴到你的頭，面，身止來，如同珍珠似的分洒着，姿態既美麗而又嫵媚溫柔。並且，這種坐以待水的辦法是極適宜於不擅長游泳的人們的！大家也要注意：如果你缺乏力氣，還是不要滑到海裏去的好。因為，流水無情，有力的浪頭，鬆軟的沙泥，它往往要在不知不覺中陷害你！</p>
<p>到那裏的路程，是先要到北京路外灘市輪渡碼頭（即是著名的「水上飯店」之旁），那里每隔一點鐘便有一班渡輪開出。來回的輪費軍費，如坐二等艙位，則　　六角八分，並可買來　　　。渡輪從上海出發向東，在黃浦江中破浪直前。江風不斷地拂着衣衫吹來，使你已可忘了溽暑。如果你坐頭等艙位，那便更「寫意」了，在艙面上還備有帆布椅子，你可以很舒適地坐着，靠着。兩岸模糊的建築物和江中清晰的外國兵艦商輪逐漸往西逝去後，便又可看見軍工路的綠蔭長堤和浦東的田野。經過了西渡，東溝，慶寗寺等地，渡輪便在高橋輪渡碼頭停靠。在那里，已經等好了公共汽車，憑票坐上去，經過了高橋鎮及兩旁碧綠的田野，行駛不到半點鐘便到高橋的海濱了。汽車路雖窄狹，但還不平坦，而且曲曲折折，頗有奇趣，下車後，就是海濱浴塲大門。進了門，踏上石級，過了收票處，便可以看見那人工佈置成的花園：彷彿如一個呂字形，一個大池塘，中間一道堤把牠分為二，上面有凉亭一座。四周的堤岸上，綠樹扶疏，枝葉蓊鬱，欣欣向榮。據說這池子裏的水是淡水，遊人可以在海水浴後到池裏用淡水再洗，以去鹽質。一排幽雅的茅屋，類如舊式廳堂建築，呌做草廳，另有大餐堂一座，呌做海濱食堂，備有麵點，酒菜，草廳中則有各種冷飲。由此東下，便是海灘。在北面，無數的帳蓬撑着，聚集了百數十男女遊客。再較高的地上，便是所謂「海濱飯店」的房子，那里，可以旅居度夏的。門窗上一抹綠紗，遠望其中的旅客，如居雲霧之間</p>
<p>出租游泳衣，帳蓬，橡皮浮水器的地方都有，費用也並不很大。灘上蠕動着健而美的人們，女性的數目並不少於男性，一陣陣海風捲地吹來，我們可以聽見歡笑聲和潮水聲相映入耳。</p>
<p>在那里，的確是一幅呹動人的夏的畫面。風景，人物，自然，俱備着！</p>

<h3 id="c192">荒島上的官 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 蓁節譯</p>
<p>從前，在舊俄時代，有兩個官，他們都是沒有腦子的，所以，他們有一天忽然覺得自己是被送到一個沒有人烟的荒島上，猶如坐着「天方夜譚」裏的那條仙毯似的。</p>
<p>他們的一生都過在　理文案的政務部裏，他們是在那裏生，在那裏敎養，在那裏長大，因此，他們對於「部」以外的一切事物一點都不知道；他們所知道的只有一句話，就是：「恭呈某某大人鈞鑒，職某某謹呈」這幾個字而已。</p>
<p>可是這政務部後來取消了，而那兩個官的職務也再用不到了，他們被辭退在空閒着。</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>所以，這兩個退職官就搬到聖彼得堡契斯克亞街去住。他們也各有各的家，自己的廚子，以及自己的退職恩俸。</p>
<p>當他們忽然在沒有人烟的荒島上醒轉來時候，他們發覺自己都躺在天空之下。在最初，自然，他們不懂他倆己碰到了什麼事，彼此都很驚疑的發着問：「天啊！這算什麽意思？我們是在那裏啊？」</p>
<p>他們互相碰碰，揑揑，使彼此證實不復是夢了。最後，他們承認了這可悲的現實。覺得在他們前面是一片汪洋，在他們後面只有一點點土地，而那一點點土地之後又是一片在洋。他們開始哭了起來—這哭可說是從他們的「部」關門後的第一次哭。同時，他們互相瞧瞧，大家都看見別一個的身上並沒甚麼穿着，除了睡衣和一顆掛在頭上的勳章之外。</p>
<p>「我們此刻是該用咖啡的時候了？」一個官說。他想着哭了起來：「我們現在怎麼辦呢？就作算我們起草一張呈文罷，但有甚麼用呢！」</p>
<p>「你要知道，閣下！」另一個官打起精神說：「你走那東邊去，我走那西邊去。到了我們大家都走還原地時，也許我們會找到一點什麽。」</p>
<p>他們便着手辨別那一方是東，那一方是西。他們記得有一次部長對他們說過：「如果你們要知道那里是柬，那末，將你們的臉轉向北邊去，那東便在你的右手那邊。」但等他們要想找出那面是北，他們只有向右轉轉，向左轉轉，以及四面八方團團的瞧着。他們因為一生都消磨在文書科裏，所以他們這努力全歸徒然。</p>
<p>「我想，閣下！最好的辦法還是你向右邊去，我向左邊去！」有一個官說。他不僅在文書科任過職，而且也在預備兵學校裏做過書法敎師，所以他聰明一點。</p>
<p>怎麽說就怎麽幹，於是一個官向右邊走了去。他一路碰見許多滿生各種果子的樹。他心中很想摘一個蘋果下來，但都高懸在樹枝上，逼得他要爬上去才行。他爬來爬去都是失敗，他所能做成的事只是撕壞了他的睡衣。走到一條溪邊，他看見深水裏無數遊着的魚：進了樹林，他看見了許多的烏和野兎等，他流着饞涎。「天啊，可以吃的東西是多麽多呀！」他喊起來，餓火更覺燃燒起來了。但他終于空着手走回的定的地點。</p>
<p>「怎樣？閣下！你找到了甚麽？」</p>
<p>「沒有，只一張舊的莫斯科新聞！」</p>
<p>這兩個官重新睡下，可是他們那個空虛的肚子不讓他們休息。他們的睡眼一牛是看見那些拿恩俸過快樂日子的人們；一半是給在白天所看見的那些鮮果，魚兒，鳥兒，野兎等騷擾得不能安定。</p>
<p>「人類吃的東西，他本來的原形是在空中飛的，水裏游的，樹上長大的。那誰會想得到呢？閣下！」</p>
<p>「對呀！」另一個官接上去：「我也必須承認；我一向以為我們早餐吃的麵包，牛油，一生出到世上，就像它們在餐桌上碟子裏那樣子。」</p>
<p>「照這樣推想起來，那麽，假如我們要吃一隻野鷄，我們是必須捉到牠，殺掉牠，拔掉牠的毛羽，把牠烤起來，但那怎麽動手呢？一兩人異口同聲地說。</p>
<p>他們靜默下來想再睡着，可是飢餓老是把睡眠逼走了。</p>
<p>「我相信我現在能够吃下我自己的靴子去！」一個官又提着神說。</p>
<p>「皮手套也不壞，尤其是如果已經用柔軟了的！」另一個官說。</p>
<p>這兩個官互相虎視耽耽地彼此凝視着。他們的視綫如火燄放射；他們的牙齒吱吱咯咯的在顫抖。一種沈濁的呻吟由他們胸口發出，他們慢慢地走近，忽然變成一種可怕的瘋人似的。他們狂呌着，咆哮着，憤火燃燒着。那個曾做書法敎師的官竟撲過去將他同僚的徽章咬下，吞進肚裏去。直到他的牙齒見了血，才使他們的意識恢復過來。</p>
<p>「上帝救救我們呀！」他們同時喊了出來：「我們决不能相互將別人吃了下去！」</p>
<p>他們又沈默了一下。</p>
<p>「無論如何，我們必須互相講點什麽把時問消磨了去。否則，我們將會發生謀殺和死亡的事了！」一個官說。</p>
<p>「你能够解釋嗎？太陽為什麽先算起來而後落下去呢？為什麽不顚倒一下呢？」</p>
<p>「你不是一個好笑的人嗎？你是先起來的！閣下！以後你到科裏辦公，然後，午……」他瞪着眼不敢說下去。</p>
<p>「但人為什麽不反一反呢？可以先睡，看過了夢中的東西而後才起來！」</p>
<p>「啊，不錯。但我從前做官的時候，我老是這麼想：現在黎明了，隨後快要是白天，唔唔……隨後便要吃晚餐了！」他又衝口地說出來。但說到「晚餐」兩字，使他們想起了白天的遭遇，兩個官都悲愁起來，他們又靜了一會。</p>
<p>「有一個醫生吿我，人可以用自己的精神支持一個長時期。」一個官又重新開始說。</p>
<p>「那是什麽意思？」</p>
<p>「這是很簡單的，你要知道，人自己的精血產生別的精血，別的又循環着產生另一種精血。這樣，一直到一切精血完了為止。」</p>
<p>「那以後怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「以後必須把吃的東西放進肚子裏去！」</p>
<p>「這惡魔！」另一個官呼號着。</p>
<p>無論他們談甚麽問題，結果總是不變地轉說到「吃」的上面去。這，只能使他們的食慾更加厲害起來，所以，他們决意什麽都不談了。他們想到那張拾得來的舊莫斯科新聞，另一個官就開始讀下去：</p>
<p>「州官賜宴誌盛！山珍海錯，大快朶頤！」</p>
<p>「惡魔！請你不要再讀下去！」另一個官用一種絕望的神情在呌着。他把那報紙從同僚手裏奪了過去，自己開始找別的讀：</p>
<p>「本報通訊員從妥拉來函云，昨在烏珀水邊獲得鱘魚一尾，此為當地罕見者，故設宴以慶之。其主菜置一大木盆中，飾以鹽漬瓜果，且有荷蘭芹一事，挿於魚口，赴宴者各得一片。其烹調異常精美！…」</p>
<p>「對不起，閣下！我想你也不是善於選擇讀物的？」於是這挿入說話的官又把報章搶過來再念：</p>
<p>「一威泰卡之老居民某，近發明一製魚羹之別出新裁食譜……」</p>
<p>這兩位官的頭都低下去了。無論他們的眼睛看到什麼地方，都是與吃有關的東西。他們的思想也是命定地想着吃。儘他們如何盡力不去想牛排一類的東西，可是一切都不行。他們的空想是不變地沒有反抗的餘地，再會回到他們所痛苦哀號的事物上去。最後，一個官很靈感地想起了一椿事：</p>
<p>「我想到法子了！」他快活地呌起來。「閣下！你以為怎樣？我們可以去尋一個農民來！」</p>
<p>「啊，一個農民，但我們怎麼捉得到呢？」</p>
<p>「這裏一定有，因為這東西是到處都有的。」</p>
<p>他們於是在荒島上亂走了許多時間，終於被他們找到了一個睡在一株樹下的農民。</p>
<p>「怎麽？睡在這裏？你這懶骨頭！」他們暴燥地發着怒罵那農民：「有兩位官在那裏快餓得要死了，你都不管嗎？起來！走！做工去！」</p>
<p>那個農民起來看見這兩個發火的紳士站在面前，他最初想逃。但這兩個官頓時捉到他了，他不得不屈服於自己的運命之下，他不得不聽從兩個官而去為他們做工。</p>
<p>他先爬上樹去替兩個官摘下幾十個很好的蘋菓，留着一個壞的給自己；以後他用木鑽出火來，他拔下自己的髮做成網去捉得幾個烏和兎，他的火燃燒了來銬着這些鮮美的野味，使兩個官很舒服地吃下去療了飢餓。</p>
<p>兩個官看着這農民能努力，他們都很高興，他們已經忘了昨天怎樣近乎死亡地飢餓了！他們只想着如何做一個統治驅策這農民的官。</p>

<p>法蘭西有一位女明星，名呌素萊兒夫人，她在一九三三年時已經有七十歲了，但由於化裝術的作用，她出現於舞台時，看來仍是那樣的美麗，仍是那樣的為人所稱羨。</p>
<p>然而，不幸得很，這位美麗的女明星，近來臉上的皺紋畢竟太顯明了，就是再高明的化裝術也不能把牠遮掩住了。於是，她悲從中來，感到靑春已逝！但她却並不灰心，還要想法藉科學的力量來回復她的靑春；她找到了一位名醫亞斯德里博士，以一萬金法郎的代價請他為她除去皺紋。結果因博士手術高强，這位年老女明星臉上的皺紋果然消除了，但她却不實行契的規定，拒絕給與博士一萬金法郎的手術費。博士不服，終於向法庭提起了訴訟。</p>
<p>這消息傳出後，一般巴黎人都非常驚異；在訴訟開審時，許多人都不的而同地前往旁聽。被吿素萊兒夫人也親自出庭，當法官問她何以違反契的時，她卽抗辯道。博士施行手術的結果，我眼緣的皺紋雖然消失，但我的眼睛却成為同魚眼睛一樣的了，不僅不能自由顧盼，而且連閉着也不可能，這還應該給與手術費嗎？但博士却說：我們的契的是為你除去皺紋，今皺紋既已除去，不管怎樣，都當履行契的。結果呢？博士的訴訟終被撤消了。</p>

<p>— 荻秋</p>
<p>在最近的蒙德婁會議中，羅馬尼亞外相鐵杜萊斯曾不客氣地指責英國代表團道：「君等在日內瓦主張一種政策，而在此地又主張另一種政策，君等實圖竭力破壞相互輔助與區域協定也！」這對於英國最近的外交態度可說是一個無情而又恰當的批評。事實上，因為大英帝國的領土屬地最多，勢力範圍最大，所以它與世界各國都有或大或小的矛盾；又因為大英帝國正在沒落中，一切都傾向保守，所以它對別的國家又都未能採取堅决的外交政策；這樣，倫敦的外交活動便成為搖擺不定的了。</p>
<p>遠者不說，單以最近的事實來看吧。例如，當倫敦突然感到希特勒的舉動對牠有危險時，英帝國主義卽與法意聯合，結成對德的斯特萊柴陣綫。但在這個陣綫剛剛形成的時候，它又覺得自己不應帮助法國以制德，於是掉過頭來又與柏林談判，締結英德海軍恊定。對於意大利，在過去，英國是想和牠維持友好關係的，但不幸慕索里尼要獨吞阿比西尼亞，威脅了英國在菲洲和地中海上的權利，使它不能不一時地對意採取積極態度。因之，倫敦的外交家便忙碌起來，他們不斷地奔走於巴黎，日內瓦和倫敦之間，堅决主張對意制裁；同時，遠東的艦隊也調到地中海，甚至揚言將封鎖蘇伊士運河；一時之間，論者皆調英國已採取了積極態度。然而，在意軍侵阿獲得一時的勝利後，老大的英帝國主義一面看到尼羅河的水源並未受着現實的妨害，一面又覺得慕索里尼氣熖萬丈，不可一世，於無可奈何之中，便又不顧體面地自動在日內瓦提出撤消對意制裁，並將地中海艦隊開始調回原防，以取好於慕索里尼。在蒙德婁會中議，當蘇聯要求黑海艦隊得自由駛入地中海並主張戰時封鎖黑海時，一般皆以為這是在防止德意侵略勢力的發展，英國當可贊同，但倫敦的外交家却覺得這樣一來會威脅到英國在地中海上的勢力，因而拚命反對蘇聯的主張，以致引起羅馬尼亞外相那樣的斥責。這些事實都是最近出現的，因之都可以證明就在目前英國的外交都還在繼續動搖中。</p>
<p>對於這樣的英國外交，在意大利和德國當然是非常歡迎的。希特勒在倫敦的猶豫態度和暗中鼓勵之下重整了軍備，撕碎了凡爾賽和羅諾加條約。意大利的侵略阿比西尼亞雖曾遭到英國的反對，但首先承認這侵略結果的也是英帝國主義。現在，意德兩國更結成了共同戰綫，這便是德奧親善協定的成立。</p>
<p>根據柏林和維也納的公報，德奧恊定的條件是：</p>
<p>（一）德國承認奧國充分之主權；</p>
<p>（二）每國各允不直接或間接干涉對方內部之政治發展，奧國國社主義問題亦在其列；</p>
<p>（三）奧國擬依奧國承認其自己係一日耳曼國之基本主義，特殊對德維持一種政策，庶不擾及一九三四年之羅馬議定書，與一九三六年之附加文，及意奧匈三國各為此文一方面之地位</p>
<p>同時，奧國內閣已實行改組，著名親德份子霍斯臺勞被任為不管部閣員，史密特担任外交部長。這樣，長期糾紛未得改善的德奧關係，現巳親善起來了。由於這個親善，更促成了德意的結合，形成以德意為中心並包括波蘭和奧匈在內的中歐集團。因為波蘭一向跟隨在柏林之後，奧匈也早在羅馬支配之下，而德實過去的主要衝突便是奧大利問題，今德奧關係既已改善，德意當然可以馬上結合起來，因而波蘭和奧匈也必然更附屬在這兩大侵略國的左右，形成中歐的侵略集團。當德奧親善協定公布時，從羅馬到華沙都在表示慶幸，對於羅加諾條約簽字國會議的事，對於東菲問題，希特勒和慕索里尼都此唱彼和地表示了同一態度，所有這些可說都是中歐集團形成的精神表現。</p>
<p>自然，我們不能說道樣的中歐侵略集團完全是由動搖不定的英國外交促成的，但近年來德意兩國之不顧一切的冒險行動，與搖擺不定的倫敦外交却也有重大的關係。我們可以說，假使英國能堅决執行國際條約的義務，那世界和平至少不會受到像目前這樣大的威脅，德意兩國的冒險行動至少也要有些顧慮。</p>
<p>現在，歐洲的兩大危險國旣已結合起來，波蘭和奧匈等更附於其左右，那今後它們的冒險行為當然更要厲害，歐洲乃至世界和平的保障當然更要發生問題了。在這樣的情勢之下，首先受到威脅的便是法蘇和小協約國集團，這當然與大英帝國沒有直接關係，用不着它担憂；而且，老　說，倫教的外交家實在也很歡迎德意集團出現而與法蘇集團相對立的，因為這種形勢一造成，英國卽可居中自重，坐收漁人之利；所以，德奧協定公布後英國輿論卽表示「寬慰」。但是，假使德國隨着奧國問題的解决，突然很實際地提出收復戰前殖民地問題，那在菲洲澳洲等地英國所代管的德國舊有殖民地卽有馬上被奪回的危險，那時英國恐怕又要採取維持現狀的積極態度吧；又假使意大利在德國的帮助之下，繼續在菲洲在地中海上擴張勢力，那倫敦恐怕又要提出制裁口號吧；但對於英國不幸的事變眞的再來時，所謂臨時的積極態度實在也就沒有多大用處了。如意阿戰爭已經發生時，遠東形勢更嚴重時，英國臨時所採取的積極態度曾發生過什麼效力呢？英國要眞的獲得一時的安全，便當準備與法蘇合作，以集團的力量來制止一切侵略的冒險行動。據報載，最近蘇聯人士對英國有所批評，並謂「凡主張維持歐洲現狀者，此際允須互相聯合，藉以抵抗德國向外發展政策；而為英國利益計，亦以加入此項集團為宜，否則屈服之事，一演再演，德國希特勒兀首愈將放瞻前進，毫無忌憚矣！抑德奧兩國協定，實乃德國片面廢止雜加諾公約與在萊茵區域恢復武裝之當然結果。準此而論，該國具有侵入中歐洲之可能，以冀組成强有力之集團，用以隔離東歐與西歐。」我們以為這樣的言論是値得倫敦的外交家考慮的。</p>
<p>然而，就目前形勢看來，在保守黨內閣之下的英國恐怕還不會採取維持現狀的積極態度。它將繼續其動搖不定的外交政策：今日拉法以制德意，明日又扶助德意以抵抗法蘇集團，一面向各國結好，一面又與各國矛盾。這樣，使侵略者得以在英國的緩和與掩護之下放膽前進，以破壞和平，同時亦將反轉來危及英國。</p>
<p>今日之歐洲，英國是正處於兩大敵對集團，卽法蘇集團與德意集團之閒，站在舉足輕重的地位。假使它能與法蘇給合，那德意的向外發展常然要受到强力的阻止；反之，如果它參加乃至領導德意集團與法蘇對抗，那歐洲和平卽要馬上發生問題。但英國並不採取堅决態度，它是希望別人從事戰爭，尤其希望這戰爭移到東歐，移到烏克蘭去爆發，以便毫不受損失地從中取利。不過，事件的發展不一定全與倫敦的想念相合的。不說別的，假使法蘇和德意兩大集團的矛盾發展到了武裝衝突的時候，或者德意勢力在巴爾幹，在地中海，在菲洲與英國發生正面衝突的時候，那它在歐洲局勢中的中間地位，它的動搖不定的外交政策，必要為它自動取消的。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang telegraphed Yu Hanmou at 8:00 AM on the 18th, saying, "Tang's sincerity has not gained trust, and the advocacy for national salvation has not been thoroughly implemented. I have now decided to relinquish my responsibilities. From now on, the responsibility for national salvation, the security of Guangdong, and the attacks from my comrades will all fall on your shoulders alone.

The Guangdong provincial army as a whole has defected, and Chen, seeing that the situation was hopeless, had no choice but to take this step. It is also reported that Li Zongren has left the province and returned to Nanning by plane. It is said that Chen Jitang has temporarily entrusted military and political affairs to Li Yangjing, the commander of the Third Army of Guangdong, pending the arrival of Yu Hanmou in the province. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chen Jitang implemented wartime martial law at 6:00 PM on the 18th in and around Guangzhou. Currently, he has ordered the formal armed forces and security teams to be fully mobilized simultaneously. Key points in and around the city are heavily guarded by troops. A large detachment of the Guangxi Dare-to-Die Corps, which first arrived in Guangzhou on the morning of the 18th, is now gathering in the East School City. Furthermore, the outcome of the joint meeting of the Guangdong Party, government, and military is still uncertain, and there is concern that it may lead to disturbances such as looting. Therefore, the public feels extremely uneasy and is in a state of trepidation. (18th Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) At noon on the 18th, Chen Jitang summoned the four army commanders Li, Zhang, Miao, and Huang to a meeting at the military academy to discuss his departure. The meeting lasted two hours before adjourning. Chen decided to step down, entrusting everything to Miao Peinan to maintain. He then packed his luggage, awaiting a reply from Nanjing with a solution, and left Guangdong that evening. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang convened an emergency meeting at the military academy on the morning of the 18th, attended by many confidants including He Lu, Lin Shiqing, Lin Yizhong, and Qu Fangpu.

<p>(Hong Kong) Personnel from the Executive Department, the Political Council, and the provincial and municipal governments are scattered, and government affairs have come to a standstill. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Because Chen Jitang is determined to step down immediately, the currency has surged again, with each thousand Hong Kong dollars exchanging for only seventeen hundred and fifty yuan. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Lin Yizhong is in charge of provincial government affairs, and Chief Secretary Gan Shangren is in charge of municipal government affairs. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang left the province by ship for Hong Kong at around 5:00 PM on the 18th. As of 12:00 AM on the 18th, the ship had not yet entered the harbor to dock. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Police Chief He Lu summoned the chiefs of various branches on the 18th and stated that he was determined to advance and retreat with Chen Jitang, but maintaining the city's security was the responsibility of the public security force, and he hoped that the chiefs of the various branches would work hard.

<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zongren flew back to Yongning from the province by civil aviation plane at 4:35 PM on the 18th. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) When Chen Jitang decided to leave the province, Li Zongren immediately flew to mobilize two divisions of Guangxi troops to enter Guangzhou. Miao Peinan, upon hearing the news, led a strong force while ill to Jiangcun (fifty li from the city) to intercept them. The Guangxi troops then retreated to their original defenses. Li Zongren, seeing that his plan had failed, took the opportunity to leave Guangdong. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Because the generals of Chen Jitang are all supporting the Central Government, internal collapse has occurred. In addition to increasing the deployment of large forces to the Dongjiang to defend, from the 15th, troops entering Fujian were ordered to shorten their defense lines and concentrate entirely in Chaozhou and Shantou. According to military sources, the Guangdong troops entering Fujian have indeed been withdrawing to Guangdong. The 80th Division of Chen Qi has occupied Hutou Mountain (under the jurisdiction of Yongding). The front lines have also been very quiet in recent days. Chiang Ting-wen relayed a telegram to the province reporting that there were indeed no traces of Guangdong troops on the Fujian-Guangdong border, and local order was very stable. Bandit gangs in the counties of Putian and Shanwei are willing to reform and ask the female aviator Lin Pengxia to plead for their incorporation. It is said that there are more than one thousand people in the gang, with eight hundred guns. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The situation in Guangdong has taken a sharp turn. Chen Jitang has decided to telegraph his resignation, handing over military power to Li Yangjing. It was rumored on the morning of the 17th that Chen had fled to southern Guangdong, and in the evening, it was rumored that he would arrive in Hong Kong. As of 1:00 AM on the 18th, this has not been confirmed. It is expected that confirmation will be received on the afternoon of the 18th. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang has already boarded the Hai Hu gunboat in Huangpu today and is coming to Hong Kong. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chiang Kuang-ting and Cai Tingkai, who were invited to the province to "participate in the great plan of resisting Japan," suddenly changed their original intentions today and did not arrive in the provincial capital. This extinguished the last hope of preventing the advancing Central Army by the Southwest, which had set out to support it. It is generally believed here that the decision of Chiang and Cai will allow the overall situation to be resolved peacefully within a few days. Chen Jitang still went to headquarters to work today, but there are rumors that he has left the province. Chen's telegram of resignation can be issued at any time. It is understood that Chen has decided to do his utmost to maintain security in the provincial capital before resigning. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chen Jitang convened a joint meeting of Party, government, and military representatives at 8:00 PM on the 18th, expressing his intention to step down. He conducted final consultations on countermeasures for the current situation. The meeting is expected to determine Guangdong's attitude towards the Central Government and Guangxi. Chen's formal announcement of his resignation is also awaiting the decision of this meeting. (18th Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chen Jitang Sent Chen Hanguang to Beijing with a Personal Letter to See Chiang; Chiang Replied by Telegram Urging Chen to Come to Beijing; Hoping to Assist Yu Hanmou in Completing His Mission; The Central Government Will Handle the Guangdong Situation with Benevolent Intentions. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Jitang specially sent Division Commander Chen Hanguang to Beijing on the 18th with a personal letter to see Chairman Chiang and make a request. Chairman Chiang immediately sent a reply telegram. The original text of Chen's letter and Chairman Chiang's reply telegram are recorded together below.</p>
<p>Chen Jitang's letter: Chairman Chiang, with deepest respect, the state of affairs has reached this point, and I cannot bear to make unnecessary sacrifices. Therefore, I have decided to obey your order and step down to avoid triggering a civil war. However, entrusting Guangdong affairs to Awuqi (Yu Hanmou's alias) as chairman will not be obeyed by the generals. I am still afraid that a battle will be inevitable. I should request that your honor appoint a senior official who is trusted by the people to come to Guangdong to preside over affairs. I will relinquish everything and fulfill my initial intentions. All other matters will be presented in person by Division Commander Chen Hanguang. I respectfully wish you well, your subordinate Chen Jitang, July 17th.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's telegram: Urgent to Guangzhou, Committee Member Chen Bonan, with respect, your confidential letter has been read. Division Commander Chen has also been met. Brother's determination to retire is admirable for its magnanimity. The telegram sent by Zhongxiao (17th) Chen should have already been received. We revolutionary soldiers must always abide by the orders of the Party and the country, guide our subordinates with righteousness, and encourage them to accomplish their careers, without any doubt or fear. Awuqi is loyal and sincere to brother, both in public and in private. Now that he has been appointed by the Central Government, brother should view him as a senior official receiving orders from the Central Government. Handing over military power to Awuqi is actually handing over military power to the Central Government, and the generals in Guangdong should know that Awuqi is carrying out the Central Government's orders and is responsible for the situation in Guangdong. Therefore, obeying Awuqi is obeying the Central Government, and they must not view things from a personal perspective or harbor any differences. Brother's retirement this time is for the sake of the country, respecting the discipline of the state, and should not be regarded as merely stepping down. It is a glorious memory in our revolutionary history. All subordinates should follow brother's aspirations and fulfill brother's wishes. Brother's ability to assist Awuqi so that he can fulfill the task assigned by the Central Government will further demonstrate brother's greatness. Brother's ability to encourage subordinates to obey the Central Government and assist Awuqi will deepen the feelings of brotherhood over many years, work together harmoniously, and make a great contribution to the country will further demonstrate the loyalty and public spirit of the Guangdong generals and soldiers. If brother is concerned that there may be bias in the arrangement of the troops after brother leaves Guangdong, then Zhong can state frankly that Zhong does not have this. Each division in Guangdong has been appointed by the Central Government and has clear guarantees. The Guangdong Army is originally the army of the Central Government, and brother's subordinates are Zhong's subordinates. The love and care are originally the same. Since the revolution, the Central Government has cherished comrades-in-arms and treated them equally, and has never treated the troops poorly. Moreover, brother still serves as a member of the National Defense Council, and the Central Government's trust is the same as before. If there are any opinions on military affairs, you can still consult at any time. Therefore, brother should now trust that Awuqi can definitely stabilize the situation in Guangdong, and should earnestly explain Zhong's intentions to your subordinates so that they can feel at ease. If brother is still concerned that there may be discrepancies during the handover, then on the day of leaving Guangdong to come to Beijing, the Central Government will use loving and benevolent intentions to plan for the aftermath. Zhong can also come to Guangdong when necessary and be responsible to the Guangdong generals and soldiers, ensuring that no one is left out. At this time, I only hope that brother can come to Beijing as soon as possible to discuss national affairs so that the disputes can be resolved as soon as possible, to carry out brother's initial intention of serving the country from beginning to end, which will benefit both Guangdong and the country. All other matters will be conveyed in person by Division Commander Chen to Guangdong, and I hope you will understand. Zhongzheng Qiao, (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

Yu telegraphed Beijing for instructions. The Central Government stated that its policy on Guangdong was consistent, and it was willing to take into account past comradeship. As long as Chen thoroughly recognizes the situation, obeys the orders of the Central Government, and hands over all military affairs to Yu Hanmou, the Central Government is determined to accommodate him. It is reported that appropriate measures have already been given and instructed separately. The situation in Guangdong can be resolved peacefully within three to five days.

<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong Air Force Commander Huang Guangrui and others opposed Chen Li's collusion with foreign enemies to betray the party and harm the country. On the 17th, they specially summoned all air force officers to hold an emergency meeting and decided to immediately lead the entire air wing away from Guangdong and fly north to defect to the Central Government. At midnight, Huang ordered all aircraft to be pushed out of the airfield, equipped with fire bombs and machine guns to await orders. At 6:30 AM on the 18th, Huang, along with Chief of Staff Chen Zhuolin, Aviation School Principal Hu Hanxian, and each squadron leader of the Seventh Group, Tan Shoutao, Zuo De, and others, and more than 160 pilots, flew 62 aircraft at the same time.

Huang and others arrived in Hong Kong by ferry at around 8:00 AM and temporarily resided at a friend's place. They gave a brief speech stating that the Air Force always opposed participating in civil wars, did not collude with foreign enemies, and supported the Central Government to unify military orders. This morning at 8:00 AM, all air wings were ordered to fly to Shaoguan to await orders. Currently, there is no one in the Guangdong Air Force organs. Lower-level personnel who were unable to leave Guangdong by plane have been arriving in Hong Kong by early and afternoon trains and transferring to boats to go north. (18th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The dramatic development of the situation in Guangdong suggests that the Southwest's opposition to the Central Government will collapse imminently. Huang Guangrui, the Deputy Commander of the Guangdong Air Force, arrived in Hong Kong this morning. It is said that the entire Guangdong Air Force has surrendered to the Central Government. The Chairman of Guangdong Province, Lin Yunguai, and the Mayor of Guangzhou, Liu Jiwen, have all fled to Hong Kong. Rumors are spreading that Chen Jitang is about to resign from his position as military leader of Guangdong. Several Chinese newspapers even say that Chen has left Guangdong. However, it is known for certain this morning that Chen is still stationed in the provincial capital. Four Guangzhou military aircraft arrived here this morning and were detained by the British authorities. It is reported that several more aircraft passed through here at night, their whereabouts unknown. According to Huang's statement to Reuters, the entire Guangdong Air Force has flown to Shaoguan, which is occupied by Yu Hanmou's troops, to await orders from the Central Government. The Guangdong Air Force does not want to participate in the civil war and is willing to do its utmost to support the Central Government. Last night, a reliable source in Guangzhou reported that Chen Jitang would resign and issue a statement on his resignation today. The Guangxi troops are still entering Guangdong one after another, apparently trying to take preemptive measures to prevent Yu Hanmou from taking over the military and political affairs of Guangdong Province.

<h3 id="e7">Prospects for Anglo-Egyptian Relations <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>According to recent foreign dispatches, the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations, which began in early March, are progressing smoothly. A compromise has been reached on military issues, while the Sudan issue remains to be discussed. Whether the long-troubled Anglo-Egyptian relationship can be improved as a result of these negotiations is a question worth examining.</p>
<p>To understand the significance of these Anglo-Egyptian negotiations and to assess the future of Anglo-Egyptian relations, it is necessary to review the issues that have been in dispute between Britain and Egypt in the past. Although there have been many disputes between Britain and Egypt in the past, the most important are the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Egypt and the administration of Sudan.</p>
<p>In 1882, Britain purchased the majority of the Suez Canal shares for a price of four million pounds, driving out Napoleon's influence in Egypt. From then on, Egypt fell within the British sphere of influence. In 1889, Britain and Egypt concluded a treaty allowing Britain to station a large number of troops in Cairo and Alexandria, with all supplies provided by the Egyptian government. In 1914, when World War I broke out, Britain declared Egypt its protectorate. It was not until 1922 that the name of protectorate was abolished and Egypt's independence was announced, but the troops were not withdrawn. Since then, the Egyptian government has repeatedly resolved to negotiate with Britain, demanding the withdrawal of troops stationed in the two locations. At the same time, it also considered the so-called Anglo-Egyptian Allied Forces (commanded by British officers) stationed in Ismailia to protect the Suez Canal as an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty and repeatedly demanded that Britain completely withdraw after a certain number of years. Britain had promised these demands in the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations of 1927 and 1929, but demanded concessions by Egypt in Sudan as a condition for exchange. Therefore, the negotiations ultimately yielded no results.</p>
<p>Sudan is located south of Egypt, controlling the middle reaches of the Nile River. It is rich in cotton and is the lifeline of Lancashire, England. At the end of the 19th century, a British expeditionary force occupied Sudan under the pretext of suppressing the rebellion and regarded it as its own colony, nominally under Anglo-Egyptian co-administration. In 1924, due to the assassination of Sir Lee Stack, the British Governor-General of Sudan, even the method of co-administration disappeared in substance. This was naturally something that Egypt was dissatisfied with. However, the key point of Anglo-Egyptian contention over Sudan lies in the water conservancy of the Nile River, which irrigates Egyptian farmland. Britain's policy is to grow more cotton and less other plants, to make Egypt the main supplier of cotton for British industries. Therefore, a water gate with a storage capacity of 140 million gallons was built in Sennar, 170 miles southeast of Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, to benefit the cotton fields of Sudan. The Nile River is the main source of water for Egyptian farmland. It flows for hundreds of miles through Sudan. Its tributaries were blocked by the construction of this water gate, and the water flow was impeded. The area of cultivated land in Egypt was therefore reduced, giving a great blow to Egyptian agriculture. Therefore, the Sudan issue is a life-and-death issue that Egypt must strive for.</p>
<p>From the evolution of the above-mentioned Anglo-Egyptian relations, it can be said that without a solution to the Sudan issue, there is no way to improve Anglo-Egyptian relations. Recently, in order to ease the increasingly high-rising anti-British movement in Egypt, Britain has had to show considerable concessions to Egypt, appointing Sir Miles Lampson, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, and Nahas Pasha, the Egyptian representative, to negotiate the adjustment of Anglo-Egyptian relations. However, as of now, the negotiations have lasted for four months, and Britain has only agreed to reduce the defense area of British troops stationed in Egypt. It can be seen that the promise made by the British side in the Anglo-Egyptian London negotiations in 1929 to withdraw troops stationed in Egypt is also unwilling to be fulfilled. As for the Sudan issue, it has not yet been heard that the British side has made any concessions. Therefore, the improvement of Anglo-Egyptian relations is not necessarily optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Cantonese People Monitor the Outflow of Silver <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) More than 80 influential figures in the industrial, commercial and financial circles of Guangdong Province, including Xiong, believe that the authorities have issued banknotes indiscriminately in recent years, reaching more than 250 million yuan, while all the silver is only more than 90 million yuan, less than 40% of the total amount of banknotes. Therefore, the value of the currency has plummeted, and prices have soared. The people of the entire province have been suffering unspeakably. Recently, they have even tried to transport the silver to Hong Kong and Hainan Island, handing it over to a certain country to purchase military fire, for the war of rebel parties endangering the country. If this is the case, the more than 250 million banknotes will become waste paper, and the lives of the 30 million people of Guangdong will be cut off without remainder. Therefore, they have to shout loudly and unite all circles, and organize the Guangdong Provincial People's Silver Custody Committee on a scheduled day, and invite Zou Dianbang, the former member of the legal currency fund custody committee, and others to join in the north to strictly monitor the outflow of silver. They also recommend representatives to ask Chen Jitang to consider the friendship of his hometown and not to do this to cut off the lives of the people of Guangdong, and also hope that fellow villagers and financial tycoons in Shanghai and Beijing will unanimously support and ensure that the authorities' plan to destroy the province is stopped and a lifeline is retained for the people of Guangdong.

<p>Montreux The new points of the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits have been agreed upon yesterday. The draft convention can be finalized. It is now scheduled to hold the last general meeting at 10:00 p.m. on Monday, the 19th, and sign the new convention. After the matter is completed, it will be announced to be closed. Now the Bulgarian country, which opened the conference, has also decided to sign the new convention, and does not intend to request amendments, but according to Article 16 of the convention, warships of various countries can pass through the straits to deal with aggressor countries for the implementation of regional conventions. Bulgaria argues that the so-called aggressor country should be designated by the League of Nations. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Montreux After the Montreux Conference opened today, all the demands put forward by Japan were accepted. The delegation of the country was therefore very happy and said that it was grateful that the countries participating in the conference were able to find ways to satisfy the demands put forward by Japan. The points that Japan is satisfied with are listed below:</p>
<p>Article 23 of the British draft originally advocated that warships of various countries may pass through the straits when implementing the covenants of the League of Nations or when implementing existing and future regional conventions, and this convention is within the structure of the League of Nations. The Japanese delegation made a reservation on this article. Now the draft of the new convention has divided the implementation of the covenants of the League of Nations and the implementation of other regional conventions into two articles. The former is included in Article 23, and the latter is included in Article 16, and a proviso is added under the wording of implementing various regional conventions, stating that this regional convention should be limited to those signed and participated by Turkey.</p>
<p>The draft of the new convention stipulates that submarines belonging to countries not bordering the Black Sea are not treated the same as other warships and are not allowed to pass through the straits. This is in line with Japan's requirements. Regarding this level, there is an exception, that is, submarines belonging to countries bordering the Black Sea that are built abroad or repaired abroad are treated separately.</p>
<p>The conference allowed Japanese training ships to freely enter and exit the straits, but their total tonnage should not exceed 15,000 tons. According to this tonnage, it is the highest limit stipulated in the draft of the new convention.</p>
<p>Regarding the tonnage of warships of various countries passing through the straits, according to the original agreement of the conference, the Turkish government should notify the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Sir Eric Drummond, on a regular basis. After Japan opposed it, it was changed to notify all the signatory countries of the new convention, and Japan was also included.</p>
<p>The conference originally agreed that once the new convention is established, Turkey can rebuild defense fortifications on both sides of the straits. The Japanese delegation then stated that unless this issue is submitted to the Privy Council of the country for approval, the delegation will not sign any special protocol that allows Turkey to rebuild defense fortifications. This proposal has been approved by the Turkish government, so the rebuilding of defense fortifications on both sides of the straits will have to wait until the Japanese Privy Council makes a decision before it can proceed.

<p>London Today, the whole of Europe is paying attention to the events in Spanish Morocco. According to news from Gibraltar, the unrest is spreading rapidly. The Spanish government broadcast on the radio today, admitting that a rebellion had occurred in Morocco, but said that the unrest had failed. It is said that a part of the Moroccan army resisted the government. The unrest is limited to certain urban areas. No one in Spain has participated. The national army is now advancing to suppress the rebels. The authorities are capable of controlling the overall situation, and the original state will be restored soon. Although the Spanish government issued a message to appease the people, compared with other news, the situation of the unrest is increasing. (18th Reuters)</p>
<p>Perpignan, France An Associated Press interviewer learned today with certainty that Spanish army officers were plotting to revolt on the 25th of this month. The garrison in Melilla, Morocco, took the lead yesterday when the time was not ripe. The autonomous province of Barcelona in Spain has also been affected, but the rebellion there was put down by troops loyal to the government. One soldier died and four were injured. (18th National News)</p>
<p>Gibraltar An interviewer from the company recently declared that the garrison in Spanish Morocco has already rebelled, and the area is already under the control of the rebel soldiers. The Spanish government has recently dispatched a large number of infantry today, traveling by two ships, from Ceuta to Algeciras to suppress the rebellion at opportune moments. As for within Spain, there are rumors of mutiny. It is feared that it may spread throughout the country. There are also rumors that the navy stationed in the two military ports of Cartagena and Flor has mutinied. Various observers believe that the turmoil in Spain is due to the increasing infighting between the left and right political enemies after the assassination of the Royalist leader Sotelo. It is feared that the military will carry out a coup. In fact, the military has not taken any action. (18th Havas)</p>

<p>Madrid The mutiny in Morocco was quickly put down by the government's dispatch of troops, and it denied that there was any instability in Spain. Communications between Spain and the outside world were restored at 2:35 a.m. this morning. According to the government's announcement, the mutiny was limited to Melilla, Morocco. The claim that a revolution would occur in Spain is purely unfounded. Melilla has a total of 15,000 residents, 1,000 garrison soldiers, and a large-scale gunpowder depot. (17th National News)</p>

<p>Madrid: Following the assassination of Royalist leader Sotelo, the situation is very tense. Cabinet members held successive cabinet meetings at the Prime Minister's office and the Ministry of Interior last night, working through the night. Moderate Socialist leader Besteiro and key party members Prieto and Cordero visited the Ministry of Interior this morning to confer with various officials. President Azaña also quickly returned to the capital from Prado. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>London: Spain is likely to experience serious riots. This morning, due to a major political event, telephone communication between the country and foreign nations was cut off. A secret telegram from Paris stated that an incident occurred in Chanca (80 miles southeast of Madrid), and the number of casualties is unknown. The current tense situation in Spain is a result of the assassination of prominent Royalist leader Sotelo on Sunday. Sotelo was taken from his residence this morning by individuals dressed as police officers, and his body was later found in the Madrid River, covered in knife and axe wounds. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: Serious disturbances have occurred in the Spanish capital Madrid and other cities such as Quintanar. Long-distance telephone communication between this port and Madrid has been cut off by Spanish authorities. Only government officials can communicate between La Línea and Madrid. Although areas bordering this port in Spain are generally calm, all troops in this port have been ordered to halt leave. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Madrid: This morning, Spain cut off telephone communication with foreign countries, and telegrams are subject to strict censorship, causing delays of several hours compared to usual. Authorities claim this is due to political reasons. For a time, the outside world was unclear about the situation, assuming that a serious incident must have occurred in Spain. However, according to news from Hendaye, border traffic is normal.</p>
<p>It is reported that riots occurred in San Sebastián during the funeral of the assassinated Royalist leader Sotelo today. As the hearse proceeded to the cemetery, someone opened fire on the crowd, killing one and injuring four. Order was restored by the police after a brief disturbance. Following the interruption of telephone communication and the censorship of telegrams, Paris was the first to receive news that an incident occurred in Chanca, 80 miles southeast of Madrid, with an unknown number of casualties. Later, news arrived that disturbances had occurred in Seville, but their nature was not mentioned. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Madrid: After several hours of silence, the Spanish government has now acknowledged a military rebellion in Melilla, on the northern coast of Morocco. Martial law has been declared in the area, and the garrison has occupied the entire city.

General Motomur, commander-in-chief of the Spanish forces in Morocco, has left Ceuta to go to Melilla. It is reported that the incident is local in nature, and Motomur believes he can handle the matter and clear it up soon. Melilla was originally a settlement for criminals and had a large gunpowder depot. It was opened as a commercial port in 1902. In 1909, troops were sent to suppress disturbances in nearby mines. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris: News received here from Tangier, French Morocco, indicates that serious clashes have occurred between the military and civilians in Larache.

<p>Warsaw: A nationwide demonstration was held in Poland today to protest the plans of the German National Socialist Party in Danzig. In Warsaw alone, the number of participants reached 30,000, representing 300 organizations, most of which were convened by the Socialist Party. Flags were flying everywhere, with inscriptions such as "Danzig is part of Poland," "The mouth of the Vistula River (where Danzig is located) must belong to Poland," and "We demand the strengthening of forces to ensure the safety of the lives and property of Poles in Danzig." The crowd gathered at the old town market in Warsaw, where several people gave speeches. One person criticized the National Socialist politics in Danzig with passionate words. Finally, a resolution was passed stating that if the current system of the Free City of Danzig is to be modified without increasing Polish rights, Poland will refuse it. The initiator of today's demonstration was General Dołęga-Szeligowski, president of the Polish Maritime and Colonial League, who died in a plane crash just yesterday outside the port of Danzig. The league has also petitioned the government to strengthen Poland's position in Danzig. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Members of the German National Socialist Party have been actively operating in Poland recently. Fifty-four party members, all illegal elements, have been arrested in Upper Silesia in the past few days. Many party members in the province have been arrested before, and the trials were concluded in May of this year. Those arrested this time will be tried by the court in October of this year. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The authorities of the Free City of Danzig took a series of shocking measures today, abolishing all freedoms recognized by the current system, such as personal freedom, freedom of speech, and freedom of publication. These measures are National Socialist in nature, as seen in the ban on Jewish gatherings. Political figures believe that these actions are tantamount to abolishing the current constitution. Observers believe that the Danzig Senate may be re-elected in the near future to legally abolish the current constitution. According to the current constitution, the National Socialist Party must obtain a two-thirds majority in the Senate to discuss constitutional amendments in order to achieve the goal of reclaiming Danzig. To obtain a two-thirds majority, a re-election must be held. However, under the current liberal system, there are concerns that the necessary votes may not be obtained, hence the implementation of the aforementioned special measures. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>London: The authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation into the attempted assassination of the King. After the police requested witnesses to the incident to testify, they have received dozens of phone calls, and people are prepared to testify at any time. The Criminal Investigation Department has dispatched specialists to answer these calls, and some have personally gone to the station to declare their willingness to be witnesses. It is expected that the post office will deliver letters describing the incident today. All reporters will be interviewed one by one to inquire about everything. Therefore, it is expected that it will take several days to draft a complete report. The assassin, McMahon, whose real name is Bennigan, is a Bachelor of Arts from Dublin University. He has lived in West London for ten years and studied botany for some time. Recently, he demanded compensation of £20,000 for wrongful arrest and wrote to the Home Secretary and the Police Commissioner about this matter. His friends consider him a madman. He considers himself a social reformer. The police station regards him as a harmless crank who worries about the times. Special police have been paying attention to this person for some time because they heard that he had a handgun. Therefore, before the incident on Thursday, they searched the area around the scene.

(The trade agreement between the United States and Cuba has tripled US exports of lard to Cuba, and other exports have also increased. The trade agreements between the United States and Haiti, Sweden, and Belgium have not actually made any concessions to these countries in agriculture.

<p>Tokyo: According to Yomiuri Shimbun, after senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs thoroughly reviewed the report of Kuwajima, director of the East Asia Bureau, on his recent travels in North China and Manchuria, they believe that the inevitable result of tolerating smuggling in North China is that, on the one hand, it has an adverse impact on the overall diplomatic relations between China and Japan, and on the other hand, it makes Japan's diplomatic position, which has been the target of international criticism since the September 18th Incident, even more difficult. The "special trade" only benefits professional smugglers from Japan and Korea, while legitimate Japanese merchants suffer serious losses. The prices of Japanese goods in the Chinese market have plummeted, and exports of Japanese goods to China are likely to decrease. The conclusion of senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggests two plans: one is for China to reduce tariffs, and the other is for the central government to allocate a portion of the North China tariffs to the local government, and to stop smuggling with the cooperation of the local government. The newspaper also made an important announcement, saying that Foreign Minister Arita is very eager to implement the above recommendations and has decided to find a way to merge the Kiyatung organization with the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to realize the so-called unification of North China politics, in order to fundamentally resolve the current crisis. Arita requested Prime Minister Hirota's approval on Thursday and sought the understanding of Army Minister Terauchi after the cabinet meeting on the 17th. (Central News Agency, 18th)</p>

<p>Paris: After the Chamber of Deputies passed the bill on the nationalization of the arms industry, Prime Minister Blum gave a radio address, saying that we do not need these arms capitalists, and called on the people to buy the new government bonds issued by the government, saying that the government does not want these capitalists to raise funds because they export capital to avoid taxation and abandon their obligations to the country. There will be a day when the people will settle accounts with these people. They took advantage of the country's difficulties to fill the vaults of foreign banks with gold and securities. We are issuing bonds now because we do not want to succumb to the authority of these few capitalists, but want to free ourselves. (Guomin, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris: The government issued short-term treasury bills worth 10 billion francs on the 10th of this month, with denominations ranging from as low as 200 francs. The principal will be repaid in one year, with an interest rate of 4%, prepaid by the government. Bondholders can request discounts from banks at any time and are exempt from income tax. The purpose is to allow funds hoarded by the public to continue to circulate in the market. Prime Minister Léon Blum gave a radio address to the nation, explaining the purpose of this treasury bill issuance, saying, "Since the people have entrusted the government with heavy responsibilities, the people should not refuse to give the government the ability it needs to fulfill its responsibilities. The issuance of the current treasury bills is a cooperative act between the government and its clients, especially small and medium-sized depositors in banks. It is highly democratic in nature and can be popularized throughout the country. The funds raised are not for the government's daily expenses, but for the implementation of the political program. This political program is what the national electorate supports. The French people do not have two personalities. It is not true that the people are ideologically revolutionary, but conservative in financial matters. What kind of sacrifice does the government seek from the people? If we talk about the way to use money, what is more appropriate and reliable than relying on national solidarity and contributing to national prosperity? The entire policy of the People's Front cabinet is to make hoarded funds circulate again in the market in order to revive the national economy. Since taking office, various measures have been tried and tested. Shouldn't the people of the country feel interested in this experience? Although there are unscrupulous people who evade taxes, the government does not want to humbly beg them to comply. What the government wants to strive for is to prevent these people from transporting bonds or cash abroad to fill the vaults of foreign banks. France has its own place to store money, and that is France itself. The government will never declare surrender to these unscrupulous people. I call out loudly to the people of the country, so that everyone can hear and unite. The treasury bills issued now are not the result of succumbing to capitalism and oligarchy, but a tool to liberate the shackles of capitalists. It is hoped that the people who love freedom will understand this meaning. I cannot help but expect it." (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Locarno Pact Conference: Britain Seeks to Resolve European Situation, Believing Tripartite Meeting of Britain, France, and Belgium Inadequate; France Also Unwilling to Declare Negotiations with Germany a Failure <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>London – Although the British government has not yet received official notification of the decision made in Paris yesterday to hold a conference of the Locarno Pact nations (Britain, Russia, Belgium) in London on July 23rd, local figures believe that the meeting cannot surpass existing diplomatic channels. London hopes that the tripartite meeting will serve to exchange opinions on issues to be discussed at a future conference of Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, and Germany. It is said that Britain wishes to participate in the meeting with broad policy objectives. British policy aims to resolve European problems. Many believe the British government will strive to prevent Europe from repeating the events of twenty-two years ago, dividing into opposing groups forming a complex situation. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London – Well-informed sources recently declared that if the tripartite meeting of Britain, France, and Belgium can reach an agreement, then a conference of the five Locarno Pact signatory nations (Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, and Germany) will be held in Brussels on August 15th. According to responsible sources, the British government is now planning large-scale diplomatic action. This action includes the following three phases:</p>
<p>Preliminary Tripartite Meeting.</p>
<p>A conference of the five signatory nations of the Locarno Pact. Each nation will participate on an equal footing. The purpose of the conference is to establish a new mutual assistance pact for Western Europe to replace the Locarno Pact and to guarantee the security of the borders of France and Belgium.</p>
<p>A large-scale European conference to be held in late summer or early autumn this year to resolve the general European situation and to revise the economic, financial, and colonial clauses contained in the Treaty of Versailles, thereby avoiding the resolution of all European issues being solely initiated by Germany or according to its plans.</p>
<p>It is said that Sir Vansittart, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, informed the French Ambassador, Corbin, of the above plan during a meeting this afternoon. The government's greatest concern at this time is the five-nation conference, with the tripartite meeting merely a prelude to it. Whether a conference of all European nations can be held is still uncertain. It is now known that the agenda for the tripartite meeting will include the following issues:</p>
<p>Procedural issues. In other words, under what conditions and in what manner should Italy and Germany be invited to hold a five-nation conference? On this point, it would be easier to resolve if Germany could provide an answer to Britain's question. However, despite reports that Germany's answer is imminent, the British side is still eagerly awaiting it.</p>
<p>A new system to replace the Locarno Pact. Regarding this, Britain advocates basing it on the principle of mutual assistance and abandoning the system of unilateral guarantees. Until the new system is established, the guarantees that Britain provided to France and Belgium on March 19th of this year, namely military assistance, will remain in effect, but will not be a permanent measure.</p>
<p>The resolution of the general European situation. Regarding this, it should only be mentioned briefly and not seriously discussed until Germany participates in the five-nation conference and expresses a clear view. Britain is now concerned that the countries of Eastern Europe will become alarmed if the resolution is limited to Western Europe alone, and therefore urgently wishes to reassure them. At the same time, it also does not want to give Italy and Germany an excuse to become even more closely aligned. Therefore, it intends to limit the scope of discussion at the tripartite meeting and strive for clarity, so as not to present Italy and Germany with a fait accompli of an agreement between Britain, France, and Belgium, but to leave room for understanding at a future five-nation conference.</p>
<p>When this conference convenes, the heads of government and foreign affairs officials of the three countries – British Prime Minister Baldwin, Foreign Secretary Eden, French Prime Minister Léon Blum, Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos, Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland, and Foreign Minister Janson – will all attend in person. Its importance goes without saying, but political figures particularly value the opportunity for the British and French heads of state to meet and discuss matters. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris – There have been rumors that the conference of the three Locarno Pact signatory nations (Britain, France, and Belgium) would be postponed. Official circles were deeply concerned that if this were to happen, it might be misunderstood as evidence of a passive attitude and divergent opinions among these countries. Therefore, they strongly opposed such a move. The conference is now scheduled to be held in London on the 23rd of this month, and officials are quite satisfied. They declare that the tripartite meeting will surely produce good results, promote the situation in the future, and that both Britain and France now agree that Italy and Germany should be invited to participate in a five-nation conference at a later date. Ultimately other nations might also be invited. Responsible sources have also stated that France's views on the agenda and objectives of the tripartite meeting are exactly the same as Britain's. That is, the objective of the tripartite meeting is to seek a lasting solution to the European situation. Therefore, in addition to the issue of the Rhineland regime, the general European situation should be submitted for discussion. France does not intend to ask the conference to declare that negotiations with Germany have failed. Therefore, Britain's guarantee to France and Belgium on March 19th of this year, namely the implementation of military assistance measures, will also not be considered. In addition, before the conference opens, Britain, France, and Belgium may issue a joint declaration to prove that the three countries' opinions are in complete agreement. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome – The Mediterranean coastal countries formed a mutual assistance pact last autumn, and Greece also joined it. According to the Stefani News Agency here, the Greek government has formally notified the Italian ambassador that Greece now considers this mutual assistance pact to be cancelled. It is reported that Greece has informed Britain of this decision. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Brussels – Officials have formally announced that the three signatory nations of the Locarno Pact, namely Britain, France, and Belgium, will hold a conference in London on the 22nd of this month. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e52">Secondary Education (Part 1) <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Professor Liao Shicheng, Guanghua University, Shanghai</p>
<p>The Position of Secondary Education: China has a population of 400 million, but there are only about 400,000 secondary school students (according to the Ministry of Education's 19th year statistics, there are 179,000 senior high school students and 218,000 junior high school students). On average, there is only one secondary school student for every thousand people. Since the ratio of secondary school students to population is so small, it seems that the status of secondary school students in society is not very important. However, from another perspective, most of the leaders in the country's political, military, legal, educational, industrial, journalistic, scientific, literary, and artistic circles have received secondary education. Therefore, the quality of a country's military equipment, the profit and loss of wealth, the rise and fall of politics, the prosperity and decline of industry, and the rise and fall of culture are all directly or indirectly related to secondary education. If secondary education is not developed, the basic training of the people will not be sufficient. The so-called basic training includes both the tools of knowledge and the cultivation of the spirit. For this reason, all countries attach great importance to secondary education.</p>
<p>The Origin of Secondary Education: It has only been a few decades since China started running new education. The schools that were first established were mostly single-stage systems, with no institutions for continued research above and no preparatory schools below. In the 23rd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, Sheng Xuanhuai founded Nanyang Public School in Shanghai and established upper and middle divisions above the outer division, starting to have a three-stage organization. The University Regulations promulgated in the 24th year of Guangxu (1898 AD) were also divided into three stages: university hall, middle school hall, and elementary school hall. This is the origin of the name of middle school in China. In Western countries, the name of middle school appeared very early. In the ancient Athens, there was a distinction between primary and secondary schools. The first school established in Athens was the elementary school. The purpose was to temper the body and mind and cultivate noble morals in citizens, so the curriculum was very simple, with only sports and music. Later, as culture gradually progressed and society became more complex, elementary education could not meet the needs of the time, so there were organizations of philosophical schools and rhetorical schools or grammar schools. The curriculum included grammar, rhetoric, debate, logic, geometry, and other subjects, which corresponded to the middle schools of later generations. By the Renaissance, Latin middle schools were established, and secondary education became widespread in European and Western countries.</p>
<p>The Evolution of Secondary Education: China's formal academic system began in the 28th year of Guangxu. Since that year, the system of secondary schools has undergone several changes. The first prescribed academic system required four years of middle school to graduate, but it was not implemented. In the 29th year, the Qing court ordered Sun Jiaxiao, Zhang Baixi, and Zhang Zhidong to jointly review the school regulations and issue them to the country for implementation. The academic system established at that time changed the length of middle school to five years. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the academic system was changed again, and middle school was changed back to four years. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the National Education Federation held a meeting in Guangzhou and passed a draft of the new academic system, which was formally promulgated by the government in the eleventh year. The spirit of the new academic system focused on the middle stage. It shortened the length of elementary school and lengthened the period of secondary school, forming a 6-3-3 system - six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, and three years of senior high school. Although this system has been revised twice by the National Education Conference, it has remained largely unchanged and is considered the longest-lasting academic system in the history of new education in China. Critics of the academic system say that the 6-3-3 system is a product of the United States and is not suitable for national conditions. In fact, the separation of junior and senior high schools is a common trend in various countries. We can cite a few examples from Eastern and Western countries:</p>
<p>1.  England: Although England stipulates that the period under the age of fourteen is the period for compulsory education, children can participate in competitive examinations at the age of eleven or twelve and transfer to three types of secondary schools: Grammar schools, which focus on liberal arts and sciences; "Selective Modern Schools" or Central Schools, which are not vocational schools, but have practical courses in industry and commerce, and graduate in three or four years; "Modern Schools" or Senior Elementary Schools, which focus on practical courses and graduate in three years. In this experiment, British educators believe that the period from eleven to fifteen or sixteen years old is a special educational period, during which students should be fully developed according to their individual characteristics and should not receive professional training at a very young age. Therefore, Central Schools and Senior Elementary Schools actually have the nature of junior high schools. Some people even advocate adding a four-year "junior high school department" to elementary schools. The trend of promoting junior high schools is very obvious in England.</p>
<p>2.  France: French children can also transfer to middle school-level schools after studying in elementary school for five or six years. One type is senior elementary school, which graduates in three to five years; the other type is national and public middle school, which graduates in seven years. Although senior elementary schools focus on vocational courses, students can still transfer to liberal arts schools, which is very similar to the nature of junior high schools. National and public middle schools are divided into two circles, the first circle for four years and the second circle for three years. Each circle forms a stage, which is very similar to junior and senior high schools, isn't it?</p>
<p>3.  Germany: German children enter middle school very early. After studying in elementary school for four years, they can transfer to secondary schools. However, after the war, the trend of secondary education was to delay specialization and make the curriculum of the first few years of each middle school consistent. The "Reform Real Middle School" is an example. Therefore, six-year middle schools, such as Kealschule and middle schools (Miltelschule), in addition to the fact that the courses in the first few years are close to elementary school, actually have the nature of junior high schools. The last three years of nine-year middle schools are similar to senior high schools.</p>
<p>4.  Italy: Italian middle schools are usually divided into two stages. The first stage is called "Ginnasio" or junior high school. The first stage of liberal arts middle schools is five years, and teacher training schools and vocational schools are four years. The second stage is called "Liceo" or senior high school. Liberal arts middle schools and teacher training schools are three years, and vocational schools and science middle schools are four years.</p>
<p>5.  Russia: Russia stipulates that the period from eight to seventeen years old is the period for general education. These nine years of general education are called the unified labor school. The unified labor school is divided into two departments, the first department for four years for elementary education, and the second department for five years for secondary education. The second department is further divided into an early stage and a late stage, the early stage for three years, which is suitable for junior high school; the late stage for two years, which is suitable for senior high school.</p>
<p>6.  Japan: In the current academic system, although middle schools are stipulated to be five years, they have actually been shortened to four years, becoming a disguised junior high school; higher schools are similar to senior high schools.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation in various countries, there are several common points that can be brought up:</p>
<p>All countries acknowledge that the period from eleven or twelve years old to fifteen or sixteen years old is a special educational period.</p>
<p>Secondary education in all countries starts at around twelve years old.</p>
<p>Middle schools in all countries are divided into two stages, similar to the organization of junior high schools and senior high schools.</p>
<p>During the junior high school period, both further education and vocational training are generally taken into account, and the distinction is not very clear.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the 3-3 system is not a unique product of the United States, but a common trend in various countries. After the establishment of the National Government, all stages of education have made great progress. In terms of the improvement of secondary schools, in terms of quantity, the number of secondary school students has increased from 120,000 to more than 400,000 within ten years; in terms of quality, such as revising middle school regulations, stipulating the independence of normal schools, expanding vocational education, improving middle school curricula, promulgating moral education standards, implementing military training, and piloting the joint examination system, all have had a great impact on secondary education.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that imported artificial silk and artificial silk piece goods should be inspected in order to prevent smuggling. However, domestic factories also manufacture artificial silk piece goods, which are not subject to inspection. Unscrupulous merchants often use smuggled imported artificial silk to make piece goods and transfer them to the interior, which hinders the effectiveness of preventing the smuggling of artificial silk. Moreover, it is not easy to identify which artificial silk piece goods are foreign goods and which are domestic goods. If domestic goods are not inspected, licensed, and sold, it will also cause difficulties for legitimate commercial transportation. In order to prevent the aforementioned malpractices, nine measures have been specifically stipulated for the inspection and clearance of artificial silk purchased by various factories and domestic piece goods woven with artificial silk or mixed with artificial silk. On the one hand, the artificial silk of various factories or the piece goods made with mixed artificial silk will be inspected in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on the Inspection and Sale of Imported Goods. On the other hand, the inventory of artificial silk purchased by various factories and the piece goods made will be cleared. In addition to submitting a report to the Executive Yuan for record, the Ministry of Finance has separately consulted relevant departments and instructed its subordinates to handle it in accordance with the instructions on the 18th.

<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the transfer of the Liujiang Coal Mine, Ishida Hisatomo, the manager of the Taiki Company, came to Tianjin again and negotiated with Fang Zhiwu, the representative of Liujiang stationed in Tianjin. The company offered to pay 330,000 yuan upon signing the contract and the remaining 330,000 yuan in three years, or replace it with coal production. Liujiang, with a mine value of more than 2.9 million yuan, has already painfully reduced the selling price by 660,000 yuan and wants to pay the cash in one lump sum. The negotiations between the two parties have therefore stalled again. Recently, the mine's motor was damaged, and water has entered the 14th and 15th lanes. Only the 12th and 13th lanes produce coal. The water distance to the main pit is only 18 feet. Repairs will cost 100,000 yuan, and the entire mine is in danger of being abandoned.

<p>— Our Correspondent Hu Shenchi, Hu Yizang</p>
<p>3. Our Compatriots in Kobe</p>
<p>After having a good dinner, we went to the Consulate General of the Republic of China in Kobe, located in Shimoyamatedori. This Consulate General has jurisdiction over the overseas Chinese affairs in twenty-one prefectures and counties in Kansai (including the four major cities of Osaka, Nagoya, Kyoto, and Kobe) and Shikoku. The consulate building is a two-story Western-style building, with the visa office and reception room both located downstairs. When we entered, Consul General Jiang Hua was not in the consulate, so Vice Consul Pan Jinyao came out to receive us. Vice Consul Pan is a handsome young man who talked with us cordially for two hours in the reception room. He gave us much guidance regarding our travel. When we inquired about overseas Chinese affairs, he replied in detail as follows:</p>
<p>'The number of overseas Chinese in Kobe was originally not large, but since the Great Kanto Earthquake in the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923), a large number of overseas Chinese from Yokohama moved here, and the number greatly increased. According to a survey by the Kobe Municipal Government in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), there were more than 6,600 people, which was the peak period for overseas Chinese in Kobe. After the Mukden Incident occurred, many overseas Chinese here returned to China, and the number greatly decreased. According to the latest register of the Consulate General, there are 1,700 households and more than 3,800 people of overseas Chinese in Kobe, most of whom are engaged in commerce or handicrafts. In terms of commerce, there are more than 70 overseas Chinese trading firms in the local area, including Fuyuhe, opened by Ma Pin San (engaged in the import and export of sugar and ramie), and Xinruixing, opened by Zhou Qibo (engaged in the export of cotton cloth and cotton yarn), which are larger in scale, each with a capital of 500,000 Japanese yen. Trading companies can be divided into two major groups: Guangdong-Fujian and Sanjiang. The Guangdong-Fujian group mostly deals in business in Southeast Asia, while the Sanjiang group mostly deals in seafood. In addition, there are 15 overseas Chinese-owned grocery stores, 9 money exchange shops, and more than 100 silk shops in Kobe. In terms of handicrafts, there are mostly tailors, barbers, chefs, and painters. There are 56 tailor shops, 62 barber shops, 13 restaurants, and 8 painting workshops in Kobe, all of which are opened by overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>'In order to relieve unemployment in their own country, the Japanese government has been tightening its restrictions on Chinese laborers year after year. Now, not only are there no Chinese workers in factories all over Japan, but even the overseas Chinese who were originally engaged in handicrafts in Japan, such as barbers, tailors, and chefs, are still subject to strict restrictions by the Japanese police at any time. Since the thirty-second year of Meiji (1899), the Japanese government has promulgated several laws and regulations to restrict foreign labor and foreign entry. (Note) Any newly arrived Chinese who want to live in Japan must have a guarantor to ensure that they will not engage in labor in Japan before they can disembark. Existing overseas Chinese barbers and chefs must obtain passports from the authorities, which must be renewed every year. If the authorities suspend the issuance of passports, they will have to close their businesses.'</p>
<p>'Last year, a dispute over the suppression of Chinese workers occurred in Nagoya. Consul General Jiang personally went there to investigate. That group of Chinese workers did not obtain permission from the authorities, but was secretly hired by a Japanese foreman to do the hard work of transporting coal. Originally, Japanese foremen liked to hire Chinese laborers because they could endure more hardship than Japanese workers. Although they were subjected to harsh treatment and only earned 30 or 40 cents a day, they could still save money to send back to their home country. However, since that dispute occurred, there have been no more Chinese laborers in Nagoya.'</p>
<p>When we asked about the organizations and schools of overseas Chinese in Kobe, Vice Consul Pan replied: 'There is a Kobe-Osaka Chinese Association, which has a long history and is similar in nature to the charitable halls in the mainland, handling the charitable affairs of overseas Chinese. The association's building was built with funds raised by overseas Chinese. The annual expenses are covered by the rent from the association's leased real estate (3,000 yuan per year), and donations are solicited from local overseas Chinese merchants at any time. A few years ago, when China suffered a major flood, the Chinese Association remitted a large amount of donations to the country, which shows the concern of the overseas Chinese in Kobe for their motherland. Currently, there are 23 directors of the association, and one person is publicly elected as the chairman, who is usually rotated among the Guangdong, Fujian, and Sanjiang groups. In addition, there are also the Kobe Guangye Guild, the Kobe Sanjiang Chamber of Commerce, the Kobe Fujian Chamber of Commerce, the Kobe Chinese Merchants' Nanyang Export Association, the Kobe Chinese Tailors' Association, the Kobe Chinese Barbers' Association, the Kobe Chinese Painting Industry Association (i.e., the Painters' Union), the Hyogo Prefecture Chinese Silk Industry Association, the Kobe Anhui-Jiangxi League, the Kobe Chinese Chefs' Association, and the Kobe Chinese Charity Association. As for the schools run by overseas Chinese, there are currently only two primary schools. The Kobe Chinese Tongwen School was closed for a year due to the September 18th Incident. It is divided into two departments: primary school and kindergarten. There are currently 14 faculty members and more than 400 students. The principal is Mr. Zheng Hanguang. The Kobe-Osaka Chinese Primary School is managed by the Sanjiang Guild, with 7 teachers and more than 200 students. The principal is Mr. Dong Gongxu.'</p>
<p>Vice Consul Pan also talked about Kobe's trade with China: 'According to the consulate's visa manifest, the goods shipped from Kobe to China every month total more than 2 million Japanese yen, of which more than 1 million are exported to Shanghai. The main types of goods are cotton yarn, seafood, and textiles.' Of course, in reality, Kobe's exports to China are far more than this amount, because the so-called special trade that evades our country's customs duties is developing day by day.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Cheng Jun</p>
<p>(21) Rural Scenes in Zhongxiang After the Disaster</p>
<p>Zhongxiang borders the Han River and is rich in rice and cotton, making it the essence of agriculture in the province. Recently, due to the collapse of the Yaodi Dike, it has suffered another flood disaster. The melon of Huangtai has been picked again and again. The countryside is desolate, and it has become the same as other counties. After the reporter inspected the Yaodi Dike, he conducted a survey of the rural areas of the entire county. Seeing that the past glory has become a thing of the past and thinking of the difficulty of recovery and the ease of destruction, I couldn't help but feel emotional.</p>
<p>The county is divided into three townships: mountain, lake, and river. The fields in the mountain township are alternately fertile and barren, suitable for growing rice and wheat. The lake and river townships, except for low-lying and sandy areas, are all fertile land, suitable for growing sesame, cotton, soybeans, ramie, sorghum, etc. The rice in the mountain township is the most abundant, reaching more than 2 million dan per year, which is transported in large quantities out of the country, either from Yangzikou and out of Chihekou, or from Bengtoukang and out of Lihekou, to reach the Xiang River, all of which are extremely convenient. Fengle River, Huangzhuangmiao, and Tanggang are also ports for transporting rice out of the country. After the autumn harvest, sailing boats are like weaving, with 60-70% transporting rice and the rest transporting cotton and sesame. The countryside is a purely agricultural society, and farmers mainly engage in farming and do not engage in animal husbandry, fishing, or hunting. Therefore, the resources for their livelihood all depend on the income from agricultural products. In recent years, they have often had good harvests, and their lives have been relatively stable. The taxes they bear are 1.2 cents of regular tax per mu of high-quality land, 7 cents of surtax, 1 dime of mu donation, and 5 cents of baojia fee, totaling 3.6 cents. For medium-quality land, it is 8 cents of regular tax per mu, 6 cents of surtax, 1 dime of mu donation, and 5 cents of baojia fee, totaling 2.9 cents. For low-quality land, it is 6 cents of regular tax per mu, 4 cents of surtax, 1 dime of mu donation, and 5 cents of baojia fee, totaling 2.5 cents. The amount of tax is also quite fair, depending on the fertility of the land. Farmers work at sunrise and rest at sunset, and their hard work is enough to provide them with food and clothing. In the environment of widespread rural bankruptcy, they are surprisingly self-sufficient, which is due to the fertility of the land.</p>
<p>The abundant agricultural production is due to the fertile land and convenient irrigation. However, because it borders the Han River, it is prone to floods. Fortunately, there is a large dike to provide protection. Unexpectedly, last autumn's flood, the collapse of the Xiang Dike, was in Zhongxiang territory, with a total of 18 breaches in the Third and Fourth sections of construction, as well as the Eleventh section of construction. Three breaches occurred in the protective city dike, and the people's dike in the central and northern sections also completely collapsed. The Han River carried the momentum of a waterfall and drove straight down, and the devastation was unprecedented, breaking all previous records. The flooded area was more than 11.4 million li, accounting for 24% of the national area. The flooded farmland was 706,370 mu, accounting for 50%. The sandy land was 223,310 mu, and 50,114 houses were washed away. The population death toll was 220,822, and the number of disaster victims was 318,320. The loss of agricultural products and livestock is even more difficult to estimate. After this unprecedented catastrophe, the vitality was depleted, and bandits such as Qiu Zhaigong, Mei Daoxian, and Xiang Youyao took the opportunity to stir up trouble. The team of Song Dewen and others then mutinied. Starving people and hooligans colluded to intercept ships, creating a chaotic situation. Although County Magistrate Xiong Daochen quelled the rebellion, and the public order was maintained, the essence of the countryside was exhausted.</p>
<p>This spring, the National Economic Council built a Yaodi Dike that stretched for more than 40 Chinese miles, all within the county's territory. It was originally intended to provide work relief to disaster victims. Initially, due to poor management, the disaster victims who came to work and receive relief could not even support themselves after working all day, and they fled one after another. Then, the Lianbao chiefs and baojia heads forced them to work, causing great disturbance to the people. By the time the two wheats were ripe in May, they were not allowed to harvest them because of the dike construction, and there was no time to plant new seedlings. They still thought that the dike construction would be completed and they could celebrate peace forever. Unexpectedly, on the 26th of that month, the Yaodi Dike collapsed, and the water was torrential. Tens of miles outside the dike became a vast expanse of water. Most of the area inside the dike was also flooded. The people were serving on the dike and could not spare themselves to rescue. The ripe wheat and beans were all submerged. Many of the elderly, weak, women, and children were drowned. The total disaster area was 3,000 square li, and the number of disaster-stricken households was 17,000 households and 83,000 people, which was not as great as the previous year's major disaster, but the suffering of the farmers was even greater than last year. After last year's disaster, the countryside had nothing. They did not hesitate to borrow from various sources to start spring farming. The wheat and bean seedlings were all debts of the farmers' blood. Now they have been washed away by the flood again, and no new seedlings have been planted. The autumn harvest is also hopeless. Not only will they not have the ability to borrow money for farming in the future, but they will also have no way to maintain their simple lives at present. Grass roots and tree bark have now become treasures. The county borders Suizao, and bandits appear and disappear unpredictably. Now that they have suffered another catastrophe, the honest farmers will eventually take risks. This is what discerning people are deeply concerned about. (Sent from Zhongxiang)</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence Lieutenant Commander Nishioka Shigetai, Commander of the 13th Destroyer Squadron of the Japanese Navy in Taiwan, arrived in Shantou on the 30th of last month with the warships "Uzutake" and "Hazutake." The municipal government was not notified in advance, and they sailed into the harbor and docked. Nishioka met with Mayor Chen Tongchang and East District Committee Member Li Hanhun on the 20th of this month, raised the "Kakuda Incident," and attached many conditions, demanding that Li agree to resolve them. Later, Li resigned and left Shantou. Nishioka then led the "Uzutake" and "Hazutake" warships back to Xiamen to report the negotiation process to Hosogaya, Commander of the 16th Fleet of the Japanese Navy. Hosogaya, as the representative of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, is responsible for negotiating the case, while the Japanese Consul in Shantou is only assisting. On the 8th, Nishioka again led the "Uzutake" and "Hazutake" warships to Shantou, still without notifying the municipal government in advance. They freely enter and exit Shantou Port. However, on the 9th, the two warships returned to Xiamen. Currently, Japanese warships cruising along the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong include "Asagao," "Fuyou," "Kanzou," and "Hayanae." They often travel back and forth in the coastal waters. Smuggling steamers and sailing boats, loaded with large quantities of smuggled goods from Taiwan or the Fujian border, often follow Japanese warships to Nanao to unload their cargo. At the coastal areas of Nanao, Ronin groups have set up 13 warehouses. Seamen and inferior people are often in secret collusion with smugglers to unload smuggled goods and transport them to the Chaoshan and Meizhou inland for sale. Currently, Chaoshan only has 100 men from the 17th Gendarmerie Brigade, 300 men from the Public Security Bureau's Security Brigade, 800 policemen from various districts, and over 400 anti-smuggling soldiers, distributed in various locations to maintain public order. National defense is extremely weak. According to rumors, the Japanese fleet is waiting for an opportunity to act in Xiamen. Moreover, the Japanese side has lodged three protests due to the "Kakuda Incident" and Chen Jitang's anti-Japanese stance. Furthermore, according to information leaked by Taiwanese people in Shantou, if a war breaks out in the upper reaches of the Han River or on the Fujian border, Japanese warships will definitely send sailors ashore under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese to reap the benefits. Therefore, the general public in Chaoshan is both afraid of war between Yu Hanmou's army and Chen Jitang's army and worried that foreign powers will take advantage of the situation to invade, endangering the territory. Therefore, they are all deeply worried.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Shanghai-Hankou Three-Route Water-Land Joint Transport - Implemented on July 21st - <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In the past, the Yangtze River shipping between Shanghai and Hankou was dominated by Chinese and foreign merchants. Goods were monopolized by them, and travelers rarely transferred by train via Nanjing. In recent years, due to the impact of rising and falling water levels, all upstream and downstream goods are transshipped through Wuhu every winter. This is because Wuhu is located in the middle of Shanghai and Hankou, controlling the intersection of upstream and downstream. Since the completion of the Jingwu section of the Jiangnan Railway Company and the joint track with the Yaohuamen station in Nanjing, and the joint transport of cars with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the traffic in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has changed. Although the freight transport of the Huainan Road to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is limited to four kinds of wheat, rice, rapeseed, and soybeans, the export of agricultural products from Anhui Province is very different from the past. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company believed that it was necessary to cooperate with the Jiangnan Road and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway in the lower reaches to carry out joint water-land transport. After several discussions, detailed measures have been planned. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially sent Zeng Guangqing, the chief of the Business Department, and the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways specially sent Xiao Weiguo, the chief of the Train Department, to Wuhu on the 16th to sign a contract with Zhou Xiansong, the general manager and transport director of the Jiangnan Road. It was decided to implement it from July 21st and try it for six months. The Jiangnan Road will also increase the speed of the Jingwu section trains by 40 minutes from July 21st. In the future, the situation of water and land transportation on the Yangtze River will change greatly.</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Joint Transport Stations include Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang. The Jiangnan Road Joint Transport Stations are Nanjing Zhonghuamen, Dangtu, Wuhu, and Xuancheng. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Joint Transport Stations are Datong, Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuxue, and Hankou, all with Wuhu as the connecting station. In terms of time, in addition to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships still operating on schedule, strive for accurate time. (1) The Shanghai-Wuhu direct train departs from Shanghai at 7:55 and Nanjing at 14:40, arriving in Wuhu at 17:30, connecting with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company upstream ship. It departs from Wuhu at 8:00, connecting with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company downstream ship, arriving in Nanjing at 11:00 and Shanghai at 20:50. (2) Jiangnan Road Wuhu-Sunjiafu section: departs from Wuhu at 11:00 and arrives in Sunjiafu at 14:00. (3) Beijing-Wuhu direct train departs from Nanjing at 11:50 and arrives in Wuhu at 14:55. Also, it departs from Nanjing at 18:50 and arrives in Wuhu at 31:50. It departs from Wuhu at 10:45 and arrives in Nanjing at 12:55. Also, it departs from Wuhu at 13:10 and arrives in Nanjing at 16:06.</p>
<p>The freight rates are all charged at 85% of the original price. The passenger joint tickets are also reduced to the lowest discount. (1) From the Beijing-Shanghai Railway with Nanjing as the central station, the third-class train fare is 2.55 yuan from Shanghai North Station for the ordinary train and 3 yuan for the express train. From Wuxi, the fare is 1.65 yuan for the ordinary train and 1.95 yuan for the express train. From Zhenjiang, the fare is 6 yuan for the ordinary train and 7 yuan for the express train. (2) From the central station Nanjing to Wuhu via the Jiangnan Road, the fare is 1.45 yuan from Zhonghuamen, 1.15 yuan from Yaohuamen, 4 yuan from Dangtu, and 0.85 yuan from Xuancheng. (3) For those who come to Wuhu from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company first-class ship, the fare is 0.75 yuan from Datong, 1.2 yuan from Anqing, 2.25 yuan from Jiujiang, 2.55 yuan from Wuxue, and 3.45 yuan from Hankou.

<h3 id="e72">Serious Disaster in Hexi, Gansu Province: Provincial Government Distributes Relief Funds and Orders Counties to Lift Grain Restrictions <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, previously stated that various counties in the province had suffered successive natural and man-made disasters, leading to rural bankruptcy and people unable to make a living. The situation was especially dire in the counties of the Western Route [Hexi Corridor]. To provide relief and prevent widespread suffering, he requested and received approval from the Central Government for the allocation of 250,000 yuan in public bonds, equivalent to 147,273.70 yuan in cash, for disaster relief. However, given the severity of the disaster in the Hexi counties, it was decided to allocate over 78,000 yuan first, distributing it according to the varying degrees of disaster in each Hexi county, to meet immediate relief needs. This proposal has already been submitted to the Provincial Affairs Conference, which resolved to allocate the relief funds according to the proposed distribution amounts. It is reported that the provincial government, to ensure that the disaster victims receive practical assistance as soon as possible to sustain their lives, wired the allocated relief funds to various sub-bureaus in Hexi through the Ping City Official Money Bureau a few days ago, instructing the respective county magistrates to collect the funds and distribute them earnestly and diligently. As for the remaining portion of the public bonds, after allocating funds to the Hexi counties, there is a remaining balance of over 60,000 yuan. This has been further allocated: 2,000 yuan to the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau for relief of refugees, and 2,000 yuan to Commissioner Hu of the three districts in eastern Gansu to handle local post-disaster affairs. The provincial government originally intended to allocate the remaining funds to other disaster-stricken counties after receiving reports from all affected areas, and would then distribute the funds evenly. However, because the counties that have already reported disasters are in urgent need of relief, the provincial government, to expedite relief efforts, has decided to first select the counties with the most severe disasters from those that have already submitted reports and distribute funds to them in advance for relief. The remainder will be distributed after all reports have been received, to avoid delaying relief work. This demonstrates the provincial government's concern for the disaster situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the disaster situation in the Hexi counties, according to reliable investigations, the most severely affected are Jiuquan, Anxi, Yumen, and Dunhuang. Recently, the number of disaster victims in Jiuquan City alone has exceeded 4,000. Although the government provides each person with four taels of cooked noodles daily as relief, this is insufficient due to the large number of people and the limited amount of noodles. There have been reports of disaster victims starving to death. In May, the county governments implemented a ban on grain exports, and wealthy households also hoarded food and refused to sell it. Upon hearing this, the Commissioner's Office urgently ordered all counties to immediately issue a proclamation lifting the grain export ban, and instructed wealthy households in both urban and rural areas to open up their granaries and sell grain fairly, without engaging in price gouging. After the order was issued, secret agents were dispatched to various counties to investigate whether there was any insincere compliance. As a result, current grain prices have fallen slightly compared to early June.</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Truth About the Fishermen's Riot on Daishan Island—Triggered by Increased Salt Taxes <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: On the afternoon of the 13th, fishermen and salt workers on Daishan Island, Dinghai, clashed with tax police over opposition to "return piling" [a salt tax collection method], setting fire to the weighing station and the office of the salt field administration, and killing Miao Guang, the director of the Daishan field and head of the weighing station, Qian Dianhe, an employee, and Hu Bugui, the tax police captain. Many fishermen and salt workers were also killed or injured. It is reported that the real cause of the incident was the increase in salt taxes. In previous years, fishermen purchasing salt for fishing were charged four yuan per salt permit. Each boat household was allowed to purchase one permit, which entitled them to purchase a season's worth of fishing salt without additional fees. This year, there was an attempt to increase the tax on permits, with each salt permit only allowing the purchase of ten dan of salt, approximately 1,300 jin, costing four yuan. However, each fishing boat typically requires 7,000 to 8,000 jin of salt per season, and even more for larger boats. Therefore, each boat would have to pay at least 20 yuan in permit fees per season. Furthermore, if the fish catch was small and there was leftover fishing salt, it would have to be weighed and taxed at the weighing station, otherwise, if discovered by tax inspectors, it would be treated as smuggled salt and punished. As a result, many were subjected to tax inspections and penalties, leading to deep resentment. Also, the office hours of the weighing station were set from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., after which salt weighing would cease. Therefore, fishing boats arriving at night or in the middle of the night wanting to purchase fishing salt would have to wait until the next day. The fishermen's fishing season only lasts for three "big tides" each month, and often waiting to purchase fishing salt would delay one tide, resulting in significant losses. This is a major reason for the fishermen's hatred of the weighing station. According to visitors from Daishan, the number of weighing station staff killed in this incident, excluding the director Miao Guang, totaled more than 20. The number of tax police killed or injured could not be accurately determined. More than 30 fishermen and salt workers were killed, and over 100 were injured. The most gruesome aspect was that the hearts of the murdered weighing station staff and tax police were gouged out by the fishermen. It is said that the people of Daishan always resort to this cruel method when causing trouble, believing that extracting a person's heart and liver can cure heart pain. Currently, the provincial authorities have dispatched security teams, water police, and tax police to suppress the situation and apprehend the perpetrators for punishment. However, the rioters have fled en masse after the incident. Shops, however, have resumed business as the situation has calmed down.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Reorganization of Zhang Kewu's Bandit Troops in Southern Fujian; Recruitment of Lu Zhenshan's Troops Also Planned; Zhang and Lu's Troops are the Largest in Southern Fujian <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Zhang Kewu's bandit troops in Dehua were reorganized by Ye Cheng, Deputy Director of the Security Department, on the 13th in Nanting, Dehua. Seven companies were formed and issued 3,000 yuan for food expenses. Ye returned to Dehua County that evening, passed through Quanzhou on the 14th, and arrived in Xiamen on the morning of the 15th. According to Ye, "I arrived in Dehua on the 12th and went to the Nanting Shiniushan area where Zhang's troops were gathering. I personally inspected Zhang's troops with Huang Su, the commander of the 2nd Security Regiment, Councilor Zhu Zhaohang, clerks Jiang and Liu, and a mobile soldier. Zhang's troops had concentrated five companies, five to six hundred men, with weapons including automatic rifles, machine guns, pistols, and rifles. Another unit of over two hundred men had not arrived due to the rain. It is estimated that those arrived and not arrived in Dehua have seven companies, and another unit is concentrated in Xianyou due to the long distance. Councilor Zhu and clerks Jiang and Liu were left to handle the unfinished reorganization work. I passed through Quanzhou to Xiamen and plan to report the progress to Director Jiang in Zhangzhou tomorrow (the 16th). After Zhang's troops are reorganized, they will be under the Security Department as security teams, and a regiment or several battalions may be established in the future. The selection of officers and their designations will be determined after the reorganization is completed. Zhang Kewu said that he was originally a small businessman and does not want to take on heavy responsibilities again, and intends to invite Zhang Xiongnan, who is currently in Hong Kong, to return and preside over the troops. As for Lu Zhenshan's bandits in Anxi, they are fewer in number than Zhang's troops. It is reported that Lu and Zhang are also in alliance, and it is planned to recruit them first and reorganize them into regular security teams. If Lu remains stubborn, the 2nd and 9th Security Regiments stationed in Quanzhou and Yongchun will be ordered to encircle and suppress them. With the Lu troops resolved, the bandit problem in southern Fujian can be declared settled." It is reported that Zhang Kewu's troops are the largest in southern Fujian and are also a relatively strong civilian army. They were originally Zhang Xiongnan's troops, and after Zhang Xiongnan left the army, Zhang Kewu took over leading his troops. Lu Zhenshan is a major bandit leader, but his troops are smaller than Zhang's, and his strength is far inferior. If the recruitment and reorganization of the two troops is successful, the problem of the civilian army in southern Fujian can be completely resolved. Currently, the Security Department has sent Lin Qianzheng to contact Lu. (July 16th)</p>

<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since Qingdao was returned to our country, active construction has been underway. Recently, a shipyard and the No. 3 Wharf have been established. Ships of 10,000 tons or more can be docked for repairs at any time and can be loaded and unloaded near the wharf. The facilities are complete, so commerce is developing rapidly and the number of imported ships is increasing daily. In addition to the irregular arrivals and departures of Japanese warships, during the summer, dozens of European and American warships, cruisers and destroyers, visit the port for summering. As for passenger and cargo ships arriving at the port, Japanese ships are the most numerous, with 732 ships annually, totaling 1,346,342 tons. Cargo ships account for 40% and scheduled passenger and cargo ships account for 60%. Chinese ships are the second most numerous, with 626 ships annually, totaling 711,856 tons.

<p>The Wu family, who run the Yongshun Rice Shop in Guozilong outside the east gate of this city, was robbed once last December, but the case has not been solved. Unexpectedly, more than a dozen robbers, carrying handguns and tree branches, broke in again last night. They spoke with a Jiangbei accent from north of the Yangtze River. They beat Wu Weiyuan's mother and wife, and also severely beat a Xia surnamed woman, who was most seriously injured, bleeding from all seven orifices. Thirty yuan was stolen from her side. The manner of their beating was extremely cruel, and the losses were significant. The victim has reported the case to the 4th Police Station, which has forwarded it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. The injured have been sent to Rongcheng Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Landlord Yang Pingyu Commits Suicide in Suzhou <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yang Pingyu, 34 years old, residing at No. 52 Dongmatazi Lane, Lindun Road, Suzhou City, owned over 2,000 mu of fertile land and lived a very prosperous life. Recently, due to the peasants' resistance to rent and the establishment of public depots in various districts, Yang also appointed his bookkeeper Zhu Peichu to join the sixth district public depot in Weijingtang to collect arrears of rent. Since the tragic rent collection incident in Weijingtang, the families of peasants such as Gu Zian, who were shot and killed by the security team, have hired lawyers and formally filed a lawsuit with the local court, and published a warning in the newspaper. Yang, suffering from palpitations, developed the idea of ​​fearing punishment and being tired of the world, and hanged himself the night before (the 17th). Because he was sleeping alone in a room, no one noticed at first. Previously, Feng Runzhen, a rent collection committee member in the case, had a bedding roll placed in Yang's bedroom. It was not until yesterday morning (the 18th) when Feng instructed someone to go and move the bedding that Yang's death was discovered. Yang's wife, Wu, then petitioned the court for exemption from inspection.</p>
<p>Additionally, Yang graduated from Yancheng High School, and his wife, Huang, studied at Datong University in Shanghai. They had two sons, the eldest being only 14 years old. It is estimated that they had 400 mu of land in Weijingtang, on which their livelihood depended entirely. Last year, the average rent collected per mu was only one yuan, while the land tax to be paid was one yuan and two jiao per mu. Yang was physically weak and suffered from neurasthenia. This suicide is suspected to have been caused by panic. The day before (the 17th) in the afternoon, he went to the Jiuru Teahouse for a drink. After returning, he washed his feet and went to sleep upstairs, while his wife and children lived downstairs. Yesterday morning (the 18th), someone went to inquire about the address of Feng Runzhen, only to discover that Yang had hanged himself. It was learned that Yang was disappointed about the rent collection, and had set up a summer tutoring center at home this summer, teaching 20 male and female students, with his wife as an assistant teacher, to supplement their income. It can also be seen from this that his situation was not as good as before. It is also learned that his father was also a neurotic person in his lifetime, so Yang's suicide seems to be related to heredity.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been uneven, suddenly cold and suddenly hot, coupled with torrential rain, continuous all day long, resulting in the river rising sharply, measuring as much as five feet. Low-lying fields are in danger of being submerged. Farmers are generally planning for flood prevention work. Small boats in the countryside are also facing difficult navigation due to the river being full. Some bridge openings and decks are only about two feet away from the water, so it is difficult for small boats to pass. If the river rises another two inches, there is a risk of suspension of navigation.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Silk Mill Labor Dispute Resolved <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The labor strike in the silk mills in this county has lasted for six days. After the Party and government agencies made every effort to mediate, the resumption of work was resolved. At 4:30 a.m. on the 18th, under the maintenance of order by the security teams, the female workers went to the mills one after another to resume work, and the order was very good. However, the Taifu Silk Mill in the south gate was delayed until the afternoon to resume work. The Yongsheng Silk Mill in Fengmen was vandalized by the female workers and is still being repaired, so it will have to resume work on the 19th. However, at about 2:00 p.m. on the 18th, more than 200 female workers from the Yonglong Silk Mill across the river from Wuqiao in the north gate and the Guangye Silk Mill on Huigong Bridge suddenly attempted to cross the river and enter the mill to cause trouble. The security team officers from the Second District Command went to suppress them, and the county government telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to send additional police to disperse them, so no incident occurred. The county government also ordered the police officers stationed in various mills to pay attention to the workers' actions when they left work at 6:00 p.m. If there were any suspects with reactionary tendencies, they should be immediately arrested and severely dealt with by the county. All police officers were also required to concentrate at the county government at 7:00 p.m. that evening to listen to a speech. Also, at 5:00 p.m. on the 18th, County Magistrate Long convened representatives from both labor and management to hold a mediation meeting to discuss the workers' proposed treatment issues. The Public Security Bureau arrested three female workers, Liu Lushi, Wang Zhaodi, and Wang Alan, in Houqijie and took them to the bureau for questioning. It is rumored that these female workers are suspected of instigating the labor strike.</p>

<p>Wang Yuhai, a farmer from Yaowan, Ganquan Mountain, in the western countryside of Jiangdu, was carrying a load of baskets to Dongge outside Yangzhou to buy sweet potato seedlings at about 3:00 a.m. on the 14th. When he passed the Maoerdun area, he was suddenly grabbed by Yu Zaitao, Yu Zaixing, Liu Yushan, Yan Changxi, and two unnamed individuals, who said, "Something of ours is missing, you stole it," and immediately searched him. They took three yuan of national currency. The two sides then clashed. Shi, a butcher from Shijiagang, passed by and recognized Yu and others, and mediated for Wang. Yu and the other six still refused to let Wang go, so Shi left. Wang was dragged by Yu and others to the foot of Maoerdun Mountain, where they used cement to blind both of his eyes, and stabbed into his eyes with a knife, twisting and stirring, and rubbed cement in before scattering. On the morning of the 17th, Wang's family picked up Wang and reported the case to the Jiangdu District Court for inspection, and filed a lawsuit against Yu Zaitao and the other six for the crime of injury resulting in disability, requesting that they be legally interrogated and punished.</p>

<p>The Daishengchang Rice Shop in this city went bankrupt due to poor business. The shareholders were repaid at a rate of 50 per thousand, but Qian Bingyan, a wealthy household, was owed more than a thousand yuan, which was supposed to be repaid at 200 per thousand. Qian refused and went to urge the payment repeatedly without success. Yesterday, Tang Yangmin, the manager of the rice shop, was recuperating from an illness in a room inside Daishengchang when several bailiffs suddenly arrived, claiming that Qian had obtained permission from the court to seal up the property. The Dai family was panicked. Tang, hearing the alarm while ill, was momentarily stimulated and coughed up blood like a spring, uncontrollably, and died on the spot. Tang's wife mourned the death of her husband and, after the coffin was prepared, went to find Qian dressed in white mourning clothes and dragged him into the Public Security Bureau, shouting for justice. Qian was old and unusually frugal, accumulating assets of four to five hundred yuan. Suddenly, news spread that he had been detained by the Public Security Bureau, and there was an uproar in the city. Some who were friendly to Qian went to request bail, but were all refused. He was only allowed to be bailed out late at night, but he was already in a state of great distress.</p>

<p>City Federation of Trade Unions Telegram to Mr. Li Delin of Guangzhou: Having observed the situation where you and Mr. Bai Jiansheng have been nominally resisting Japan and advancing troops into neighboring provinces, causing internal strife, which grieves the nation; we previously telegraphed urging you to halt your actions. Recently, the generals of various armies in Guangdong, unable to bear seeing division and self-destruction, telegraphed their obedience to the Central Government and support for unification, demonstrating that revolutionary soldiers understand righteousness and cannot be compared to those with tribalistic thinking. We have long admired this. The Second Plenary Session resolved to entrust the handling of the Guangdong situation to Mr. Yu Zuoyu, and Mr. Chen Bonan also left Guangdong for Hong Kong yesterday to return power to the Central Government. The situation in Guangdong can transform conflict into cooperation, uniting national strength to resist foreign aggression. News of this has spread far and wide. However, according to reports from Hong Kong, the Guangxi army has other intentions, deploying troops into Guangdong, causing tension in the Northwest and the two Jiang provinces, making war inevitable. The people of Guangdong, facing the danger of war, are spared by Chen Bonan only to be afflicted by you both. You both call for resisting Japan and saving the nation, but how can you bear to let the people of Guangdong be the first to face the bullets of the Guangxi army in the name of resisting Japan? Moreover, without orders from the Central Government, invading a neighboring province, what is your intention? We implore you to immediately order the troops entering Guangdong to withdraw to Guangxi, and together with the comrades in Guangdong, obey the Central Government, complete unification, unite national strength, and jointly plan for national salvation. The Plenary Session appointed you both as National Defense Committee members and Pacification Directors. If you truly wish to save the nation, there is a clear path to follow. We urge you not to cast a great lifelong mistake with momentary impulse. We repeatedly urge you to rein in your horses at the precipice. We send this telegram with hope that you will carefully consider it.

<p>City Farmers' Association Telegram (Titles Omitted): Ever since Guangdong and Guangxi mobilized troops in South China, the situation has become increasingly serious. The entire nation is unanimously calling for peace. The Central Government, unwilling to see local devastation and damage to national strength, convened the Second Plenary Session to resolve the crisis through political means. Fortunately, the generals and soldiers in Guangdong understood right and wrong, recognized the stakes, and returned to allegiance, demonstrating righteousness and love for the country, setting a model for soldiers. Now that the situation in Guangdong has been averted and everything is gradually returning to normal, your troops are still stationed in Guangdong. We dare not speculate on your intentions, but since the overall plan for saving the nation and resisting foreign aggression has been decided by the Plenary Session and the National Defense Conference has been organized, your proposals have been put forward, and there is no room for further excuses. Moreover, you are also listed as members of the National Defense Committee, responsible for the border regions. You should each fulfill your duties, pacify the region, ensure the Guangdong army unanimously obeys the Central Government, completes unification, and gradually unites national strength to resist foreign aggression and seek survival. The national interest and the people's welfare deeply depend on this. Therefore, we specifically request you to promptly withdraw the troops entering Guangdong to fulfill the military's duty to obey orders. This telegram is sent in the hope that you will understand. Shanghai City Farmers' Association respectfully requests. (Dagongshe)</p>
<p>Second Special District Citizens' Association Telegram</p>
<p>"Urgent National Crisis, Guangzhou, Sent to Mr. Li Delin and Mr. Bai Jiansheng: This association previously, believing that resisting foreign aggression depends on the unification of the central government's power, sent sincere advice regarding your troops' unauthorized entry into neighboring provinces and the erratic measures taken, hoping you would heed it. Now that the overall plan for national salvation has been decided by the Second Plenary Session, and the generals in Guangdong have further understood righteousness and love for the country, collectively requesting Mr. Chen Bonan to rein in his horses at the precipice and not be a sinner to the nation, the situation in Guangdong should be peacefully resolved. However, according to telegrams from your area, you have been continuously deploying troops from Guangxi into Guangdong, attempting to make a desperate last stand, which is an intentional act of resistance. Thus, you started with resisting foreign aggression and saving the nation, but are ending with destroying unification. This association deeply regrets this. We believe that as members of the central government, you should obey the party's resolutions and set an example for the people. Moreover, your past achievements are remarkable. Why destroy them? This association believes that the Central Government's current handling is peaceful and appropriate. If you do not wish to devastate the region and damage national strength, you should immediately withdraw the troops entering Guangdong back to Guangxi to show obedience to the Plenary Session's resolutions and consolidate the Central Government's orders. Only then can we talk about national unification and concentrated national strength to resist foreign aggression and seek survival. Otherwise, under the watchful eyes of the people, the crime of rebellion cannot be concealed. The decision of what to do rests with you. Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Union respectfully requests." (Guomin She)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Guangdong Associations in Shanghai Jointly Telegraphed Chen Jitang to Come to His Senses and Decided to Convene a Meeting to Discuss Ways to Save the Hometown <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Since the changes in Guangdong and Guangxi, the entire nation has condemned them. The Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai and others have repeatedly telegraphed Chen, Li, and Bai, explaining the greater good. However, the speakers were earnest, but the listeners were dismissive, not only stubbornly refusing to come to their senses but also engaging in military actions, abusing the people, and undermining unification. The association has again jointly with various fellow villagers associations and organizations in Shanghai condemned their wrongdoings, urging them to follow the Central Government's orders, retreat in good time to maintain the hometown's integrity, and preserve their reputation. The original telegram is excerpted below: "Guangzhou Mr. Chen Bonan: It is recently heard that you are unwilling to accept the Plenary Session's resolutions, resisting the National Government's orders, and summoning the Guangxi army to Guangdong for defense and assistance in battle. The people of Guangdong are fleeing and avoiding the situation, which is extremely tragic. In this way, you are using the hometown as a desperate gamble, turning all of Guangdong into a battlefield, and plunging the people of Guangdong into eternal suffering. Recalling when the Guangxi army governed under Chen and Mo, the people of Guangdong still turn pale at the mention of it. As a native of Guangdong, how can you bear to inflict endless disasters on your hometown for your own personal grievances? It is also heard that you have formed a Finance Committee, ordering Guangdong and Guangxi banknotes to circulate equally, otherwise military law will be enforced. However, the exchange rate of Guangxi banknotes to Guangdong banknotes has always been 50%. If they are circulated equally, Guangxi banknotes will flood Guangdong Province, and the losses to Guangdong merchants will be incalculable. Thus, you are using war to harm Guangdong and using finance to disrupt Guangdong. Many generals in Guangdong have already obeyed the Central Government. Their righteous voice has spread, and the entire nation admires them. Why are you alone willing to be a ringleader, treating your hometown as an enemy, and causing pain to your relatives? For the sake of Guangdong and for your own sake, you should come to your senses, promptly retreat, and follow the Central Government's orders to maintain peace in Guangdong, which is to preserve your reputation. We are alarmed and terrified by the news and send this telegram to appeal to you, earnestly hoping you will heed our words. Respectfully awaiting your reply, Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, Jiaying Five Counties Fellow Villagers Association, Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association, Zhongshan Fellow Villagers Association, Dabu Fellow Villagers Association, Panyu Guild Hall, Huizhou Fellow Villagers Association, Wuhua Fellow Villagers Association, respectfully request." Moreover, as the situation has developed, the association plans to convene a general meeting of various Guangdong fellow villagers associations and influential villagers in Shanghai to discuss all ongoing matters for saving the hometown and the nation. They hope that Chen Jitang will finally come to his senses and urge the Guangxi army to immediately return to Guangxi to preserve their strength and unite against foreign aggression. The association also telegraphed Yu Hanmou to congratulate him on assuming the positions of Pacification Director and Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, requesting him to return to his troops as soon as possible to comfort the people's longing. The original telegram is also recorded below: "Shaoguan, Sent to Commander-in-Chief Yu: Having read your telegram, we respectfully acknowledge your appointment to a high position, your dedication to public service, and your unwavering righteousness. We are immensely delighted. Our hometown has long suffered from violent politics. Recently, there has been a mobilization of troops and incitement of chaos, abusing the people. The Central Government is concerned about the difficulties and dangers and has entrusted you with a great mission, recognizing your talent and appointing you to a position of responsibility. The people of Guangdong are overjoyed, rescuing 30 million compatriots from fire and water and saving the nation and the nation from danger. We eagerly await your banner and deeply admire you. We hope you will return to your troops as soon as possible to comfort the people's longing. We cannot help but pray earnestly, Guangzhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, Jiaying Five Counties Fellow Villagers Association, Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association, Zhongshan Fellow Villagers Association, Dabu Fellow Villagers Association, Panyu Guild Hall, Huizhou Fellow Villagers Association, Five Counties Fellow Villagers Association, respectfully request."</p>

<p>Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>At 4:30 PM, the memorial ceremony began: (1) The presidium took their seats; (2) Everyone stood at attention; (3) Music was played; (4) The most respectful salute was paid to the Party and national flags and the Premier's portrait; (5) "Love Song" was played; (6) Flowers were offered; (7) A moment of silence was observed; (8) The memorial oration was read; (9) The chairman gave a report; (10) Speeches were given; (11) The family expressed their gratitude; (12) A dirge was played; (13) The ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's Report</p>
<p>First, Chairman Cai Yuanpei gave a report, stating: "I don't know much about Mr. Zhang's childhood. One year, I went from Hangzhou to Lin'an and passed by Yuhang, where I first met Mr. Zhang. He was in his twenties and was writing the 'Qiushu'. In 1901, Zhang cut off his queue and wandered through the market, advocating for the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. His neighbors looked at him askance. Zhang Taiyan's name was taken in admiration of Huang Tai Chong and Gu Yanwu, scholars of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. At that time, there was a Jing Shi Bao in Hangzhou, and Zhang often wrote articles scolding the government and advocating revolution. Due to the environment, he soon came to Shanghai and wrote for the 'Subao' and 'Minbao'. When the 'Subao' case occurred, Zhang and others were arrested. Others were rescued and released, but Zhang was sentenced to three years in the Western Prison for the words 'clown' in his 'Refutation of Kang Youwei's Book'. He was in the same prison as Chen Tuian. I visited him at that time and sent him books and pocket money. When he was released from prison, Zhang shaved his head. People said they were afraid the wind would hurt his brain. Zhang laughed and said, 'I'm not afraid of knives, let alone the wind.' Then he went to Japan and lectured in Tokyo. The listeners were all older than Zhang and had deep roots in Chinese studies. For a time, he had a great influence on the students in Tokyo. Later, many professors in the Chinese literature departments of Peking University and the current National Central University were his students at that time. After middle age, he still did not forget his passion for politics and often telegraphed his views on the current situation. In recent years, he devoted himself to lecturing, but unfortunately, he did not complete his work and suddenly passed away, which makes people miss him very much."</p>
<p>Mr. Pan's Tribute</p>
<p>Next, Pan Gongzhan, representing Mayor Wu, delivered a speech, stating: "(1) We should not be ashamed of Mr. Zhang's spirit of advocating revolution in the late Qing Dynasty when we mourn him. (2) The Chinese people have always used the names of great masters to praise themselves. In fact, great masters should be recognized by the public. Mr. Zhang can be called a master of a generation. I deeply hope that his students can carry forward his great learning and his spirit. (3) Revolutionary thought and action should complement each other. Mr. Zhang pioneered the modern intellectual world and combined it with revolutionary action. He should be a model for us."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Professor Wang Zai Dong of National Central University (one of Mr. Zhang's disciples) gave a speech, stating: "Mr. Taiyan often compared himself to three people: (1) Gu Tinglin, but I feel that he was even more so. It was easier for Gu, a scholar of the late Ming Dynasty, to pledge to be unyielding. Zhang was born more than 200 years after the Qing Dynasty established the country, but he was still able to maintain his unyielding spirit, which is the best example of our nation's strong resistance to foreign aggression. (2) Liu Qingtian (Ji) assisted the Ming master in his great cause and restored China. Mr. Zhang can be worthy of him. There are two people who cannot be denied credit for establishing the Republic of China: one is Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and the other is Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang was the main advocate of the rise of national thought in the late Qing Dynasty. (3) Wang Chong. Mr. Zhang's 'Qiushu', innovative and skeptical spirit is unattainable. However, his later thoughts have changed slightly. He said he suppressed Confucius and Yan Hui, but in fact, he started to overthrow Kang and Liang's fallacies. Mr. Zhang did not eat Qing millet, but he was an official twice in the Republic of China: once as the Commissioner for Border Affairs of the Three Northeastern Provinces in the era of Yuan Shikai, but he left after less than two months; and once as the Secretary-General of the Presidential Palace. Mr. Zhang had his far-sighted vision in the early years of the Republic of China, considering the border affairs of the Three Northeastern Provinces to be the top priority of our country's national defense. In his later years, he lectured in Suzhou and personally drafted the regulations. It was scheduled for two years, but he died in one year, which is very sad."</p>
<p>Family's Gratitude</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang's son, Dao, and son-in-law, Zhu Duomin, took the stage, representing the family, and bowed three times to thank the guests. They bowed to the presiding committee before the music played and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>Memorial Oration</p>
<p>On the eighteenth day of July in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, and representatives of Party, government, military, police, and various organizations, respectfully offer incense, flowers, wine, and tributes to the spirit of Mr. Da Yan, saying: He was a teacher of human ethics and a model of writing. He came out early in the revolution and spent his later years studying the classics. He did not die in prison and wrote with divine power. His words spread like the wind, promoting our Three Principles of the People. When the country was first founded, he and his wife lived in harmony. When the great thief stole the country, the republic almost collapsed. He was imprisoned again in Youli and restored the Han capital. He was a prominent figure in the National Protection War. At forty, he planned for the border; at fifty, he joined the army; at sixty-seven, he grew old in the classics. Like the unicorn appearing out of season, he grieved for the chaos of the world. His father's books are in the box, and his talented children are tending the courtyard. His outstanding students are as bright as a row of stars. The torch is passed on to ten thousand readers, forever as a reminder. His life's learning is written in his works, shining on our Party and influencing our neighbors. The East and West mourn this sage together. The national crisis is urgent, and the central government is shocked. The first order is issued, and the heroes are gathered. The annals of history are full of sorrow and glory. On the Chun Shen River, mourners are like clouds. Dare we tell the people that the truth lies in his writing. If there is nothing to express, how can the ceremony unite the people? Accept our offerings!</p>
<p>Eulogies</p>
<p>Like the Buddha, appearing in the form of all beings, this man will always be a teacher for all generations. (Wu Tiecheng) The old things are shining again, and his ambition can truly inherit Huang and Gu. The subtle tradition has not fallen, and the source is naturally connected to Yu and Sun. (Kong Xiangxi) As a pioneer of the revolution and a master of national studies, recalling the imprisonment in Lei Ting, the world was shocked to hear of the literary inquisition. Avoiding the prosperity of the sea, he became a recluse in Wu. Grieving on this day when he traveled to Penglai Island, we know that he was a terrestrial immortal. (Pan Gongzhan) Mount Tai does not move, and what it passes through transforms. Escaping the world without resentment, his death is a cause for sorrow. (Yang Hu) He is a master of simple learning, gathering the achievements since the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, with his own system. He is a revolutionary predecessor, standing alone outside the Zhao and Song dynasties. (Hu Puan) A contemporary teacher and friend, is the unicorn's appearance only a pity for our Party? His great name is recorded in the rivers and seas, and the sinking star is a lament for all sages. (Municipal Government)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Deng Qingyang and Others Returned South Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The five Central Committee members sent north by the Southwest to attend the Second Plenary Session, except for Huang Linshu, who had already returned south on the 14th, and Li Qian, who remained in Shanghai temporarily due to unfinished public and private matters, Deng Qingyang, Li Renren, Cui Guangxiu, and others left Shanghai on the Lincoln President of the Great Lai Company at 12:45 yesterday afternoon to return south. Deng and others boarded the ship from the Xinguang Wharf across the Huangpu River at 11:44. Few people knew about their departure, so only related personnel such as Huang Huapei went to the ship to see them off. Before his departure, Deng met with representatives of the Xinsheng News Agency at the New Asia Hotel. According to reports, he said, "We have been away from Guangdong for many days, and we don't know the actual extent of the current situation in Guangdong. We don't know the truth of what is reported in the newspapers and official telegrams. Since the death of Chairman Hu, Mr. Xiao Focheng has been the most senior among the comrades in the Southwest in the history of the Party and the country. Now that Mr. Xiao has left Guangdong for Hong Kong, it is conceivable that the Guangdong situation has collapsed. We still prioritize peace as the first and foremost goal. Since the Second Plenary Session formulated a plan, although the situation is still tense, we hope to find a way out of the plan and peacefully resolve everything to avoid local devastation and damage to construction. We read in the newspaper that Chen Jitang arrived in Hong Kong last night, but we are not sure if it is true because we have not received a telegram from the South. If it is true, then the war can be avoided and the Guangdong situation can be resolved. We will go to Hong Kong first to consult with Mr. Xiao about everything, and then return to Guangdong. After Guangdong is in danger, it is necessary for someone to take care of it. We are natives of Guangdong and cannot sit idly by and cannot abandon our responsibility."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry established the Farmers' Bank to utilize urban capital to regulate the rural economy. Twenty-nine banks in this city have participated. The Ministry has assigned personnel to be responsible for preparations and aims to establish it at the beginning of next month. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the banks held another meeting at the Bank Club to discuss and determine the methods of underwriting fixed capital and decided to hold a follow-up meeting next week to elect directors. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Banks</p>
<p>The organizational outline of the Farmers' Bank was revised and passed after Industry Minister Wu Dingchang convened two meetings with banking circles in Shanghai and then began preparations. The bank will be located in Nanjing and is scheduled to be established at the beginning of next month. Twenty-eight banks in this city, including China and Communications, originally participated. Now Jiangsu Bank has joined, totaling 29 banks. These banks have always attached great importance to agricultural loan business. In addition to independently handling it in various places with remarkable results, 19 banks, including China and Communications, have jointly formed the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate to specialize in investing in special products such as Shaanxi cotton, Anhui rice, and Guangdong sugar, which is of great benefit to farmers. The Farmers' Bank focuses on regulating general agricultural products and circulating the rural economy, complementing various banks and cooperative syndicates, benefiting farmers more widely and deeply, so the banks all expressed their agreement.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>The following bank representatives attended yesterday's meeting of participating banks: Guo Wenhe of Agricultural and Commercial, Zhu Runsheng of China Farmers, Sun Ruihuang of Xinhua, Lu Zidong of Jiangsu, Wu Rencang of Jiangsu Farmers, Ye Zhuotang of Central Savings Association, Hu Bijiang of Communications, Wang Shaoxian of Salt, Wu Muhan of Donglai, Zou Bingwen of Shanghai, Zhang Xinyi of China, Song Hanzhang, Bei Songsun, Zhang Zhuyu of China National Products, Qi Yunqing of China Agricultural and Industrial, Wu Xizhi of Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Xu Xinliu of Zhejiang Industry, Zhou Desun of the Four Banks, Qian Xinzhi, Zhou Jiyun of Zhongnan, Sun Jingxi of Zhongfu, Chen Duoru of Zhejiang Industrial, Wang Boyuan of China Reclamation, Wu Yunzhai of Jincheng, Ye Fuxiao of Dalu, Yao Yinpeng of Zhonghui, Pan Yifen of Zhongyi Trust, Yuan Mengqin of Quangong, Hu Xian of Siming, Zhou Wusan of Tongshang, Shen Guangyan of China Industrial, and Rao Taoshu of Guohua. Secretary Gu Chengan of the Bankers' Association also attended and took notes.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the meeting opened, Qian Xinzhi was publicly elected as chairman and reported that the Farmers' Bank had a total fund of 30 million yuan, which was stipulated to be subscribed by participating banks within five years. He asked for discussion on how to underwrite the 5 million yuan this year. After public resolution, one-fifth, which is 1 million yuan, will be determined by various agricultural banks, such as China Agricultural and Industrial, China Farmers, and Jiangsu Farmers. The remaining 4 million yuan will be borne by the banks according to the proportion of the total amount of savings deposits, estimated to be 1% of the total amount of savings, which is 500 million yuan. The detailed figures will be determined after calculation. As for the election of 12 directors that the bank should elect, it was decided to convene a meeting next week to determine the selection.</p>
<p>Establish Training Class</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry has established an agricultural economic and technical personnel training class to train specialized personnel to serve in various places as the Farmers' Bank is about to open. The training class is divided into advanced and elementary classes, each taught for four months and interned for two months. After graduation, the best performers will be given priority for employment. The monthly salary for the advanced class starts at 80 yuan, and the monthly salary for the elementary class starts at 40 yuan.

<p>Trade between Shanghai and Guangdong has been stagnant for some time. Since the report on the 18th that the Guangdong situation could be stabilized, the amount of remittances from this city to Guangzhou has increased sharply. It is reported that in order to facilitate remittances for Guangdong merchants, the Kwok Wah Bank has specially established a Guangdong Remittance Department in its Hongkou branch, with particularly low exchange rates, which is very convenient for Guangdong merchants. Yesterday's market price was 617 yuan of Shanghai legal tender for 1,000 yuan of Guangdong legal tender, with as much exchange as possible, and approximately over 200,000 yuan was remitted.</p>

<p>According to the Shin Shih News Agency, Japanese ronin are engaged in large-scale smuggling in North China. In addition to sending a letter to the Beining Railway Bureau, requesting them to follow the previous order issued by the Executive Yuan and instructing the railway police to protect the customs officers stationed at the stations to facilitate inspection, the Tianjin Customs also requested Chief Inspector of Customs Merrell to quickly determine appropriate measures. Mr. Merrell went to the Central Bank yesterday to meet with Minister of Finance Kung Hsiang-hsi to report on tax matters and discuss measures to prevent smuggling on the Beining Railway. It is now reported that a general decision has been made to first send Ansell, the Director of the Anti-Smuggling General Inspection Department of the Ministry of Finance, to the north to negotiate smuggling prevention with the Beining Railway Bureau and set up anti-smuggling inspection sub-offices along the line. In response to the request from Tianjin Customs, several officers will be dispatched to Tianjin to assist with customs anti-smuggling duties. As for the anti-smuggling affairs on the southern sections of the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways, since the establishment of inspection offices along the line to take responsibility for strict inspection, considerable results have been achieved. In order to intercept the southward transportation of smuggled goods from eastern Hebei, the Inspectorate General of Customs will pay close attention to anti-smuggling duties along the Beining Railway. Once Ansell, the Director of the Anti-Smuggling General Inspection Department of the Ministry of Finance, goes north, a method can be negotiated and implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Shao Lizi Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Suppression of Bandits and Construction in the Northwest; Post-Banditry Rehabilitation Requires Funds; Rural Areas Gradually Prospering; Construction Expenditures are Significant; Opium Planting to be Completely Banned Next Year <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and his wife left Nanjing on the night express train on the 17th and arrived at the North Station in Shanghai at around 7:00 AM on the 18th. They immediately went to their residence to rest. Zhang Gongquan, Minister of Railways, also arrived in Shanghai on the same train as Mr. Shao. Mr. Shao plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days before going to Nanjing and then returning to Shaanxi to preside over provincial affairs. According to Mr. Shao, the military campaign to suppress bandits in the Northwest is progressing smoothly, and bandit areas have been successively recovered. However, the rehabilitation problem is quite difficult due to economic constraints. Construction in the Northwest, such as roads and water conservancy, is also proceeding according to plan. The annual cotton harvest in the Northwest has improved significantly, so the rural economy is gradually prospering, and people's lives are recovering. This year's wheat harvest was only 30% due to unfavorable weather, with warm winters and cold springs. However, the people are not panicked because the current weather is suitable, and if there are no changes, this year's cotton harvest could be double that of last year. Shaanxi's finances for the 24th year can be balanced, with no new deficits. Furthermore, within the expenditures for the 24th year, there are over two million for road construction and six to seven hundred thousand yuan for water conservancy construction. However, it will be difficult to balance revenues and expenditures for the 25th year because the recovery of the bandit areas in northern Shaanxi requires funds for relief and construction everywhere, and the expenses for the militia are considerable. In addition, Shaanxi's opium ban is proceeding according to plan. As of recently, only 19 counties still have opium cultivation, and this will soon be reduced. Therefore, opium tax revenue has decreased sharply, making it difficult to balance revenues and expenditures. Shaanxi must completely ban opium planting in the second half of next year, and the finances for the 26th year are expected to be even more difficult. Currently, they are planning ways to remedy the situation.</p>

The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pilot Program to Begin in the Fall: The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau's plan to implement children's savings originated at the beginning of this year. As this year is Children's Year, the Ministry of Communications instructed the bureau to plan and implement the program to cultivate the virtue of saving in children. The bureau's savings department then drafted detailed savings regulations and implementation measures, which were submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval in mid-June. A pilot program will begin with enrolled children. The ministry requested the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Education to direct educational institutions in each province and city to assist in the implementation. After receiving the order, the bureau also distributed notices to savings bureaus in various locations. It is reported that, with the exception of provinces such as Guizhou and Guangxi that do not have savings programs, other locations will simultaneously launch the program in the fall.</p>
<p>Savings Methods: The children's savings method is the same as ordinary passbook savings. School children under the age of 20 may register to save. A savings passbook can be opened with as little as half a yuan. The bureau will print savings stamps in denominations of five fen and one jiao. When registering to save, a savings grid or savings bag will be provided to paste the stamps or store the money. Savings can be deposited only after one yuan is accumulated. However, savings deposits per household may not exceed 20 yuan per month, and the total amount may not exceed 200 yuan. Savings withdrawals may not exceed two times per month, and each withdrawal may not exceed one-fifth of the savings.</p>
<p>The interest rate is half a li higher than ordinary savings, calculated at a weekly rate of five li.</p>
<p>Promotion and Implementation: In order to effectively promote the program, the bureau will be assisted by schools in various locations. In addition to printing various promotional materials and savings brochures for schools to promote, the bureau will also entrust schools to sell savings stamps and regularly send staff to schools to collect savings and open savings accounts. For encouragement, the bureau will create a savings promotion trophy. The three individuals who introduce the most children's savings accounts will be awarded a savings promotion trophy as a souvenir. The bureau has also created a savings mailbox for children to purchase and store savings. It is reported that the launch date is approximately in mid-October, right after schools start. Currently, procedures are being expedited.</p>

The aviation patriotic fund collected by the hall has been uninterrupted since August last year, with remarkable results. In response to the variety show held by various dance halls, it is scheduled to hold a full day of business income on the 20th of this month and transfer it to the fundraising donation for the purchase of aircraft for birthday celebrations. In addition to dancing and entertainment, famous movie stars and singers will be invited to participate in singing various songs to add to the fun.

The letter from the school's students and the reply from the Aviation Association are recorded below: The letter from Wubin Elementary School states: Dear Sirs, Since we heard the news of President Chiang's 50th birthday this year, we thought that President Chiang has contributed to the party and the country, and we should have a corresponding gesture for his birthday. Therefore, after a meeting of all the third and fourth grade students, we decided to launch a fundraising campaign to purchase aircraft as a birthday gift to President Chiang to express our respect. We save our pocket money every day and hand it over to the teacher. The teacher prepared a ledger for us to record the daily donations. Many of our classmates are poor, but they are very enthusiastic about paying, regardless of the amount, each doing their best. So far, we have accumulated four yuan. Now we are sending this small donation to your association. Of course, we will continue to fundraise until we have collected a substantial amount and send it again. However, the number of students in our school is limited, and we must unite the children of the whole country to donate funds together to succeed easily. Please, sirs, do your best to promote it so that our hope can be achieved as soon as possible. Wishing you good health, The children of the third and fourth grades of Wubin Elementary School. Our association received your letter and a donation of four yuan. We are very happy, many times more happy than when we receive tens of thousands of yuan in donations from adults and gentlemen. You have a considerable expression for the 50th birthday of President Chiang, the leader of the party and the country, which means that you have a patriotic enthusiasm. You save your pocket money every day, and now it is full of four yuan, collected to our association, which will be donated to purchase aircraft for birthday celebrations. This is not an easy thing. You are still continuing to raise funds, and the future results will be very good. You hope to unite the children of the whole country to donate funds together, and our association will of course do its best to promote it. We have already sent your letter to the Central Communication Reading Society for publication. Now we are sending you a receipt from our association for you to keep and wish you progress.

<h3 id="e108">China National Aviation Corporation's Hankou-Xunyang Route Suspended; Temporary Nanjing-Xunyang Route to be Operated Instead <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Aviation News Agency: Since the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Chengdu route began using large land-based aircraft, the Jiujiang Airport has been unsuitable for the take-off and landing of large aircraft, resulting in the suspension of the station for a long time. The runway reconstruction has not yet been completed. To facilitate passengers and mail, a temporary Hankou-Xunyang flight was launched on the 15th of this month to make up for the gap. Now it is felt that passengers and mail going up and down the line must go through Hankou when transferring to the large aircraft on the Shanghai-Chengdu line, which is inconvenient. Therefore, it has been decided to suspend the Hankou-Xunyang route from the 2nd of this month and operate a temporary Nanjing-Xunyang flight on the same day, still using the Jinan seaplane. It will depart from Nanjing at 9:00 AM every day (connecting with the westbound aircraft arriving in Nanjing at 10:20 AM from Shanghai at 7:00 AM).</p>
<p>It will arrive in Xunyang at 11:20 AM and depart from Xunyang at 12:00 PM, arriving in Nanjing at 2:20 PM (connecting with the eastbound aircraft departing from Shanghai). For ticket and freight prices and all details, please call 90529 to inquire with the Aviation Transportation Company.</p>

<p>Huoqiu County in Anhui Province has suffered from disasters for many years. The drought last year was particularly severe. The spring famine this year has left the population with nothing to eat. Tree bark and grass roots have been completely consumed. The Red Swastika Society specially raised relief funds and publicly appointed Liu Xichun, the president of the Wuhu Red Swastika Society, along with relief commissioners Chen Tianru, Zhou Jingbingquan, Shao Yupuo, and Tang Yuanding, to bring the funds to the county to implement relief efforts. They have now completed their work. It is now reported that the Shanghai General Office of the Society has received reports from the Huoqiu Red Swastika Society and various legal organizations in the county regarding the work of Mr. Liu and others in the county, which are very detailed. Excerpts of the report are as follows: This county's relief work has been completed after Mr. Liu arrived in the county and worked for several months. The report on the various tasks is as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection and Relief Procedures: The Swastika Society notified the Bao chiefs to create a register and send it to the Society for review. After the review, the relief workers, together with the Bao chiefs, investigated each household, personally issuing relief tickets to the victims. Every day, they advanced in order according to the route. Even in remote areas and villages where bandits frequented, they personally went to interview and issue relief tickets.</p>
<p>Relief Ticket Levels: Divided into three levels: one yuan, two yuan, and three yuan. Ordinary poor people are all considered ordinary people. Those who are widowed, orphaned, lonely, elderly, weak, disabled, or poor are all issued heavy tickets.</p>
<p>Distribution of Relief Funds: The county government dispatched personnel to go to the central locations of each disaster area, along with supervisors, to jointly distribute funds. Every day, the relief tickets exchanged for funds were collected and stamped with a "Jointly Distributed" seal. The supervisors calculated and registered them daily. In addition, Mr. Liu established a porridge kitchen in the disaster area and personally supervised the distribution, showing extreme diligence.</p>

<p>Guan Yao, an elderly woman from Yuyao, 67 years old, lived at No. 2 Songqing Lane, Xiexu Branch Road, at the home of her eldest grandson-in-law, Zhu Jinkun. The woman had a younger granddaughter, Guan Xiaofa, 16 years old, who was betrothed by the woman to Chen Shusheng, a 34-year-old Qingjiang native living next door at No. 4, as his fiancée last year. They have not yet married. However, Chen Shusheng could not wait and lured Guan Xiaofa out, continuously meeting in hotels for pleasure, which was discovered by Zhu Jinkun. So, while Chen was defecating in the outhouse, he gathered a crowd to beat him up, causing an incident. The police arrested them and sent them to the local court, charging Chen Shusheng with disrupting public morals and raping a girl under the age of sixteen, and charging Zhu Jinkun with assault, filing separate lawsuits. Yesterday, the criminal court heard the case. Official asked Zhu Jinkun, who testified that he was 25 years old, from Nantong, and that Guan Xiaofa was his wife's younger sister, and Guan Yao was his grandmother-in-law, and that he did not beat Chen Shusheng, etc. At this point, Official asked Chen Shusheng, who testified that last year he had been with Guan Xiaofa in a room at the Far East Hotel once, at the Dafang Hotel twice, and at Changhan once. Each time, she (referring to Xiaofa) asked me to go with her, buy things, and then go to the Grand Stage to see a play. Because it was late, we went to rent a room together. After this started, we often went out, etc. Official asked, Did you know how old she was? He replied, Eighteen years old. It was written on the wedding certificate at the time. Now the wedding certificate has been taken away by them. At this point, Official asked Guan Xiaofa, who testified that she was sixteen years old, a minor, born on May 17th, and that she first had sexual intercourse with Chen Shusheng in December last year, about five or six times in total, etc. Guan Yao testified that she was 67 years old, and Guan Xiaofa was her granddaughter. Her parents are both dead, and I raised her. After I issued a wedding certificate to betroth my granddaughter to Chen Shusheng last year, I learned that they were having an affair. Please investigate, etc. At this point, the Official asked Chen Shusheng again, When were you beaten by them? He replied, On the 18th of last month, I went to the outhouse to defecate, and Zhu Jinkun called ten people to beat me. They wanted to extort money from me. Official asked, Is it because you were having an affair with Guan Xiaofa that they beat you? He replied, I have no idea. At this point, Zhu testified that he was already asleep at the time and was called by his grandmother-in-law, who said that Xiaofa had been forcibly taken away by Chen, so he went to look for her. I didn't hit him. Official asked, Who hit him then? He replied, I don't know. The Official immediately announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 21st.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Qingliang Temple Monk Again Files Suit Regarding Property Dispute: Claims 28 Rooms Were Self-Built, Case Adjourned to the 23rd for Re-examination of Documents <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Qingliang Chan Temple on Xin Zha Road, one of the four major temple properties in Shanghai, was established through years of tireless effort by its abbot, Qinghai Monk, who solicited donations from all sides. Its architecture is grand, and its incense offerings are flourishing. However, the temple's land belonged to Sheng Xuanhuai, a former Qing dynasty palace guardian, and was later divided among his descendants, Sheng Yuyou, who managed the property. Qinghai Monk leased the land from Sheng Yuyou. However, in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the Sheng family abruptly mortgaged the land to the British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. for 350,000 silver dollars, transferring all property rights. Jardine Matheson, relying on the five-year lease agreement with Qingliang Temple, notified the temple to vacate upon its expiration. Qinghai Monk refused, arguing that the temple was built through years of tireless fundraising. Jardine Matheson then filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special Court. After the case arose, philanthropists such as Wang Yiting and Zhu Qinglan, aiming to protect Buddhism, formed a maintenance association and invited prominent figures from Shanghai to mediate. However, these efforts were unsuccessful, and the court ruled against Qinghai Monk, with the final verdict rendered. As the execution date approached, Qinghai Monk hired a lawyer to accuse the property owner, Sheng Yuyou, of perjury in the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. As previously reported, Qingliang Temple now claims that 21 of the temple's rooms were self-built, and an additional seven rooms were also self-built. Therefore, these 28 rooms are not the property of the Sheng family. They have hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a suit of objection to the enforcement with the Civil Division of the First Special Court against Jardine Matheson. Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, Judge Wang Shanxiang presided over the hearing in the Fourteenth Civil Court. Representatives from the Buddhist Association and the maintenance association were present to observe. Jardine Matheson was represented by lawyer Ding Rong, while property owner Sheng Yuyou was represented by lawyer Xu Shihao. The judge, stating that the case required reviewing previous case files for clarity, adjourned the hearing to 8:20 AM on the 23rd of this month.</p>

<p>Lawyer Xu Yi (号 Jingxian) was sentenced to eight months in prison last year for forgery and fraud against Li Quanshen (also known as Li Hairong), the former manager of the Gen Tai He He Fen powder factory. The verdict was final, and he is currently serving his sentence. Xu has now filed a lawsuit from prison accusing Li Hairong of forgery of seals, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Lin of the First Special Court opened a hearing. The defendant Li Hairong was absent. According to the bailiff's report, when summoned to No. 41, Lane 42, Shengping Street, Muir Road, residents stated that Li did not live there. The court questioned Xu Yi, who stated that Li's address was No. 17 and that he and Li were related. He claimed that he had been deceived due to emotional attachment. The judge adjourned the hearing to the 28th of this month. Xu Yi was ordered to remain in custody.</p>

<p>Wang Baoqing, a Ningbo native in his forties and the manager of the Central Dance School on Zhejiang Road, married a young woman from Dinghai named Ms. Chuan. They resided at No. 4, Juqing Lane, Xin Zha Road, and had been married for two years. Due to their incompatible personalities, conflicts arose frequently. On the first day of this month, Wang went to the school in the morning because it was the school's official opening day. Ms. Chuan had suspected that he had been going to school every day and returning late. His sudden early departure that day aroused her suspicion. Wang, intending to dispel his wife's misunderstanding, asked her to accompany him. Upon arriving at the school, several dance girls surrounded Wang, behaving intimately. Ms. Chuan, observing this with a cold eye, felt a surge of resentment. Knowing it was inappropriate to create a scene in public, she silently returned home, suppressing her anger. Wang came home later than usual that evening, further fueling her suspicion. The next day, while Wang was eating, Ms. Chuan began to scold him incessantly. Wang, also angered, retaliated by punching her, causing injuries to her eyes, arms, legs, and feet. Afterwards, he showed no remorse. Ms. Chuan, feeling humiliated, reported the assault to the Xin Zha Police Station. After investigation by detective Ma Zongrong, Wang was charged with assault. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special District Court conducted the hearing. After the police lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the case, the court questioned both parties, establishing Wang Baoqing's guilt. He was fined 50 yuan. If he chose to perform labor instead of paying the fine, each day of labor would be equivalent to two yuan. Considering it was his first offense, the court announced a two-year suspended sentence.</p>

<p>Xu Wenliang, a Cantonese residing at No. 1305 Yu Yuan Road, currently the Chinese manager of Mobil Oil, was kidnapped by six or seven robbers at approximately 2:00 AM on the 13th of this month, who tricked him into opening the door and took him away by car, also stealing silver dollars and diamond rings. As previously reported, the case was solved yesterday morning, and Xu Wenliang was rescued. Around one o'clock yesterday morning, a blood-soaked man was brought to the Red Cross Society on Haig Road. Upon examination, he was found to have been shot. He claimed to be an assistant of a police detective, named Cao Jianbao, but was evasive about other details. The hospital staff found this to be very strange, so they inquired at the police station based on the injured man's statement. It was discovered that there was no such detective with that name. They realized that something was amiss, so they immediately telegraphed the Gordon Road Police Station, while transferring the man to the Public Convalescent Hospital. They also began to question him about the cause of his injury, finally learning that he was involved in the kidnapping of Xu. He confessed that the victim was being held in a thatched house in Nanxiang. After obtaining this information, the police station discreetly assembled a large number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives, and set off for Nanxiang in cars overnight. They contacted the Nanxiang Public Security Bureau and requested their assistance. At dawn, they disguised themselves and went to the location from different directions, first surrounding the hideout, then attacking from the front and rear doors. At this time, the bandits were inside discussing the situation. Upon seeing the police rush in, they knew their plan had failed and attempted to escape. The detectives immediately fired several shots, first shooting down the ringleader. The remaining bandits surrendered. Xu was rescued from the inner room by the police, who were assisted by the detectives. He was pale. They then took the seven captured criminals (six male and one female) and escorted them back to the Gordon Road Police Station in Shanghai in the same car. Xu Wenliang was escorted back to his residence by armed detectives dispatched by the police station at around 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>The news about the high tide in the Huangpu River on the 21st of this month, according to the dredging bureau's forecast, exceeding twelve feet, leaving less than one foot of clearance from the Bund embankment, was reported previously. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the water levels for the high tides in the Huangpu River starting this morning will also be above eleven feet. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>High Tide Forecast</p>
<p>According to the Bureau's predictions: At 0:52 AM on the 19th, the high tide level will be eleven feet five inches. At 1:10 AM on the 20th, the high tide level will be eleven feet eight and a half inches. At 1:47 AM on the 21st, the high tide level will reach twelve feet zero five inches. At 2:24 AM on the 22nd, the high tide level will be eleven feet four and a half inches. These levels are very close to the height of the Bund's thirteen-foot embankment, and low-lying roads are bound to be flooded.</p>
<p>Unstable Weather</p>
<p>As for the local weather, since the temperature turned cooler on the 12th, thunderstorms have occurred several times. The sky is often cloudy and overcast, and the air pressure is very low. Although sunlight peeked through yesterday morning, it quickly disappeared. Even if the sun occasionally appears, it is difficult to expect the weather to clear up. It is also feared that the unstable weather will affect the high tide in the Huangpu River, causing the water levels to exceed predicted levels.</p>

<h3 id="e122">French Concession: Dispute Over Increasing Fenyu Tax <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Fenyu industry in the French Concession of this city has been embroiled in a dispute over increased taxes for half a month, which remains unresolved. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce of this city sent a letter to all the Chinese directors of the French Concession, requesting their sympathy and assistance so that the dispute could be resolved as soon as possible. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern, according to a letter from the Fenyu Industry Guild on the 15th of this month, 'Our members who operate in the French Concession number over one hundred. Recently, due to the economic downturn, business has been declining. However, since last year, the French Municipal Council has suddenly doubled the monthly tax, such as increasing the tax of one dollar and forty cents to two dollars and eighty cents. There are also increased table taxes without any standard. If merchants argue with reason, they are ignored. If they pay late, the electricity is cut off and business is prohibited. Furthermore, investigators are sent, and there are various investigation fees. At this time of economic hardship, they rely on the special power of politics to arbitrarily levy excessive taxes. Merchants have no means of appeal. Please find a way to provide assistance.' The recent regulations on classified business hygiene taxes promulgated by the council have resulted in increased taxes for various industries, but there is no clear reason or standard for these increases. If the size of the storefront is used as the standard, the tax rate often increases dramatically even if the storefront remains the same. If the prosperity of the business is used as the standard, the general economic situation is one of decline, so what is the reason for increasing taxes? The contents of the letter from your council to the French Municipal Council detail these circumstances and represent the general opinion of the merchants in the area. The Fenyu industry consists of small-scale businesses, and the impact is particularly severe. We hereby request that your directors provide sympathetic assistance and earnestly negotiate with the council to reduce the tax rate. This is our sincere hope."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Miscellaneous Grain Exchange Announces: Exemption from Margin <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Previously, due to soaring market prices, the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange stipulated on July 3rd that a margin of 500 yuan must be paid for each unit of wheat traded and on July 9th stipulated that a margin of 400 yuan must be paid for each unit of oil and 200 yuan for each unit of cake in order to prevent speculators from manipulating the market. The Brokers Association recently sent a letter to the Exchange's Board of Directors requesting that the margin be restored to facilitate business, as the market has now stabilized. After deliberation, the Exchange's Board of Directors decided to exempt all pre-payment of margin, effective yesterday. However, payment must be made the day after the transaction. The Board of Directors issued an announcement yesterday, stating: "The resolutions of the 25th meeting of the 7th Board of Directors on July 17th, in addition to informing the Brokers Association for their information, are hereby recorded and announced. It is hoped that all brokers will be informed. Special announcement: Broker Association Letter No. 16: According to a joint letter from 23 brokers, including Chang Yi Jin Ji He, requesting the restoration of the margin for the purchase and sale of various goods, it was resolved that the pre-payment of margin for the purchase and sale of various goods will be abolished from today. However, the purchase and sale contracts must be paid and received the day after the transaction. Failure to do so will result in the suspension of new purchases and sales. Further announcements will be made when the market stabilizes. Regarding the early delivery and release of spot goods, it was resolved that, in addition to the Exchange's own machine orders, all other goods may be delivered and released in advance as per the rules. If discounting is required, interest will be calculated on a current basis at 3% above the Zhuang Bank's deposit rate, and the cargo price will be calculated at 80% of the selling price, but it must be based on the Exchange's inspection form and a written application for advance delivery and release of spot goods must be submitted. The application form will be printed and prepared by the Exchange. Regarding the storage period for sesame seeds, it was resolved that the sesame seed trading rules stipulate that trading will be suspended during the months of August, September, and October each year. The Exchange's responsibility for storage should be responsible until August 10th. The Exchange will not be responsible for any liability after the deadline. The following clause will be added to the Exchange's Rule 13: (Storage period: The Exchange's liability period is up to August 10th each year. The Exchange will not be responsible for any liability after the deadline)."</p>

<p>Xiang Yang, a 50-year-old woman from Yangzhou, residing at No. 6, You De Lane, Malan Road, has a daughter named Xiang Meilin (17 years old), who possesses some beauty. Her mother borrowed money to hire teachers to teach her daughter Shenqu opera and other arts, agreeing with her daughter that she would repay the debt with the money she earned after completing her studies. She has been performing at the Fu'an Amusement Park since last year, currently earning a salary of 70 to 80 yuan per month, but has not returned any money home.

Ms. Xiang, having no food or clothing, felt overwhelmed with resentment and reported the matter to the Yimiao Police Station at 8:40 AM yesterday, requesting an investigation.

<p>Gu Zhuxuan, a suspect in the incitement to assassinate Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was arrested and brought to trial at the Second Special Court. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He appealed to the Third High Court, which declared him not guilty. However, he was also charged with bribing guards and smoking opium in the Guangci Hospital's external infirmary, based on a report from a fellow prisoner. He was sentenced to eight months in prison and deprived of his civil rights for one year, and has already been sent to prison. Recently, after being declared not guilty in the incitement to murder case, Gu Zhuxuan submitted a petition to the Third High Court, requesting the suspension of his detention during the appeal period. He also submitted a petition requesting exemption from the opium sentence that has already been served. After receiving the petitions, the High Court sent Criminal Division Chief Zhu Huanbiao, along with judges Wang Yue and Liao, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, to the Second Special Prison at 10:00 AM yesterday, ordering the police to bring Gu to the Criminal Division. Gu, wearing a white cotton short shirt and pants, covered with a gray prison short shirt with number 43, bald head, black shoes, and white socks, stood calmly before the court. After questioning Gu about his age and origin, the court said to Gu: "You submitted a petition requesting the suspension of your detention during the appeal period for the incitement to murder case. Now the police department has requested that the prosecutor of this court file an appeal. Your request has expired. If you wish to request bail during the appeal process, the decision will be approved. The opium case is still being served and must be completed by January 12th next year. But it is not possible in fact and can only be requested after the end of execution. You can now request to withdraw the request. Regarding the application for exemption from the opium penalty, this court is still under investigation, so you must wait quietly for a ruling. " Hearing this, Gu confessed that he was suffering in prison, causing numbness in his hands and feet. If the court allowed bail, he would never leave Shanghai. The court then reiterated to Gu the reasons why the two points he requested were not possible in fact, and afterwards, Gu asked the court again whether the Suzhou Higher Court had entrusted it to investigate the refugee shelter, whether there were two people named Dai Shupo and others. I once sent a letter to the Jianghuai Association to investigate, and Judge Wang Yue explained that this court has replied to the Suzhou Higher Court and investigated the refugee roster from the Jianghuai Association. You can also notify the association. After the explanation, the court ordered Gu to be sent to prison, then announced the adjournment.</p>

<p>Qian Zupei, a famous former Red Pill King from Henan, nicknamed Little Shandong, used to sell the most famous and popular No. 11 old-brand Red Pills at No. 52 Ruifu Lane, Zilaihuo Street, thus gaining the name of King. In 1932, he was arrested by the French police, explained to the Second Special Court, and sentenced to one and a half years in prison. After serving his sentence, he was released on bail but returned to his old business. Soon after, he was arrested by the French police and transferred to the Second Special Court, where he was detained for investigation. His defense lawyer requested bail on his behalf, and Judge Xiong Huixin ruled that he should be released on bail for eight thousand yuan in cash to await trial. Unexpectedly, after Qian was released on bail, he took the opportunity to escape. Subsequently, the Second Special Court ruled to confiscate the eight thousand yuan bail he had paid and issued an arrest warrant, which was sent to the French police and requested that the Chinese and rental police agencies cooperate in the arrest. He has not been captured. Recently, Qian sneaked into Shanghai again, hiding in the Public Concession, believing that the arrest had passed and the limelight was over. Yesterday morning at 2:00 AM, detectives from the Old Gate Police Station of the Public Concession received a tip that Qian was playing cards at the Central Tea House at No. 94 Guangxi Road. They immediately went to the address and arrested Qian, taking him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the previous situation and requested a transfer to the French police station. However, because the evidence was not complete, Chief Judge Qian Hongye ordered Qian Zupei to be returned to custody, awaiting a rescheduled review. The Public Concession Police Station informed the French Police Station, requesting that the Second Special Court prepare a document to send a detective to the First Special Court to transfer Qian Zupei back to court. He will be sent to the Second Special Court for trial tomorrow.</p>

<p>Recently, a clock was stolen from the Wu Song Fort Taiwan Railway Station. After an investigation, a railway patrol officer arrested the thief, a Shandong native named Xie Xiaoanzi (age 15), at No. 102 Foreign Wharf in Fort Taiwan on the afternoon of the previous day. During the interrogation, Xiaoanzi confessed to stealing the clock, saying that he had already pawned it and that the pawn ticket was on a small steamship at the Foreign Wharf.  Patrol Leader Zhang Ruixiang and officers Li Suiming and two others escorted the thief Xiaoanzi to the Foreign Wharf to search for the pawn ticket on the small steamer. Unexpectedly, when the suspect arrived at the wharf, he took advantage of the patrol officers' inattention and jumped into the river, attempting to swim away. Seeing the suspect fleeing and unable to apprehend him in the water, the patrol officers, in a moment of desperation, fired a shot into the water. It is said that the bullet hit the suspect in the back, causing him to lose his ability to swim and sink into the river in pain, where he drowned.  Seeing the disaster they had caused, the patrol officers all fled. Subsequently, a public security post officer arrived and apprehended the officer responsible, Li Suiming, who was immediately taken to the Wu Song Police Station.  After questioning by Chief Huang, it was determined that the officers had acted improperly by handling the case themselves without notifying the police station in advance and had further committed murder by opening fire.  Therefore, yesterday morning, a report was prepared and submitted to the General Bureau for disposition of officer Li Suiming. It is reported that yesterday, the patrol police authorities also sent personnel to Song to investigate the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Yesterday's Continued Hearing: Tongyi Illegally Pledges Debt Certificates Case; Xu Ji and Others State They Were Unaware of the Contents; Court Orders the Defendants to Appear Next Time <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Tongyi Trust Company declared bankruptcy on the 15th of last month due to financial difficulties and entrusted lawyer Li Zuyu and accountant Xi Yushu to handle the liquidation. The company's chairman and general manager, Huang Suchu, immediately fled, prompting general creditors to form a creditor group to protect their deposit interests and discuss countermeasures. The Jin Ye and Yang Muzhai households, whose government bonds deposited with the company had been pledged, asserted that Huang Suchu and all directors, supervisors, the deputy manager, and assistants should bear criminal responsibility for embezzlement and breach of trust. They filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, which has already held a preliminary hearing, as reported in this newspaper. However, the number of depositors whose government bonds were pledged by the company to other banks is considerable. Following the Jin Ye households' lawsuit, now five more households, including Lu Tangji, Huang Qiwen, Wu Zhongheng, Wu Xuepeng, and Yao Songtang, have also entrusted lawyer Zhang Yifan and others to file a criminal lawsuit for embezzlement and breach of trust with the First Special Court against Huang Suchu and other responsible parties, seeking to recover the value of their bonds. These households had entrusted the company with the safekeeping of various unified government bonds, including 20-year salt tax bonds and 22-year customs tax bonds, totaling tens of thousands of dollars, all of which were pledged. Furthermore, other creditors, including Xu Yeji, Xu Yeshi, and six other households, discovered that the company's total assets on the day of its bankruptcy were 6,319,589.34 yuan, while its total liabilities amounted to 6,350,952.37 yuan, with savings deposits constituting the largest portion, reaching over 2.8 million yuan, followed by insurance savings, ordinary deposits, etc. Since the liabilities exceeded the total assets, they petitioned for bankruptcy. Under the review of Judge Xu Fuki of the First Special Court, it was ruled yesterday to declare Tongyi Trust Company bankrupt on July 17th at 11:00 AM. It is expected that a bankruptcy administrator will be appointed soon to handle creditor and debtor registration procedures in accordance with the law. The company's debt disputes are likely to shift towards liquidation. As for the four criminal cases filed against Huang Suchu and others by Jin Ye and the other seven plaintiffs who had deposited government bonds, Judge Zhong Qing continued the joint hearing yesterday afternoon. The defendants who appeared were Xu Jiqing, Zhou Shouliang, Guo Yushang, Zhou Longzhan, and Yu Weiqin. The others, including Huang Suchu, Liu Fangyuan, Sun Xinchong, Liu Zikang, Liu Ning, Xiong Muqu, Jiang Liu, Fu Zhuyin, Wu Jingwen, and Deng Dongming, did not appear in court. The court questioned the five defendants who were present. Xu, Zhou, and Guo all admitted to serving as directors but stated that they did not hold actual positions. Therefore, they were unaware of the company's internal workings. Although the chairman presented business reports, asset and liability statements, and other documents at each board meeting, they were unable to detect the internal emptiness. Consequently, the board was initially unaware of the disposal of depositors' government bonds. The company had collected over two million yuan each in savings and ordinary deposits, which are currently being expedited for liquidation. The minutes of the board meetings were kept by the managing director, Liu Fangyuan, and Huang Suchu. The lawyers for Xu Jiqing and Zhou Shouliang, Xu Shihao, added some explanation. Zhou Longzhan and Jin Weiqin both stated that they were not directors and had no knowledge of the disposal of government bonds. Huang Suchu's lawyer, Wang Xiaowen, stated that Huang had left Shanghai quietly after the company's failure and that his family was also unaware of his current location. Subsequently, the lawyers for the other absent defendants also stated the reasons for their absence. However, the plaintiffs' lawyers requested that arrest warrants be issued for the absent defendants. Judge Zhong instructed the defendants' lawyers to inform their clients to appear in court, stating that regardless of whether they should bear responsibility, they must submit to trial and that evasion would not solve the problem. He then ordered a recess and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Regulations for the French Concession: Eliminating Mosquitoes and Handling Garbage <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Public Works Bureau has issued regulations to promote public health within the concession, specifically regarding the elimination of mosquitoes and the handling of garbage. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mosquito Elimination Measures</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has announced mosquito elimination measures. (1) Adult mosquitoes mostly stay close to where they hatched, so very few fly in from far away. (2) Mosquito larvae must come to the surface to breathe air. Spreading kerosene on the surface of the water can cut off the air supply and cause them to suffocate and die. (3) Kerosene should be applied to all water that cannot be drained. If water needs to be drawn, it should be taken from the bottom so that the water quality is not affected and there is no oily taste. (4) When spreading kerosene on the water surface, it must cover the entire surface. For small areas of water, the oil can be poured directly on the surface, or a hand-held sprayer can be used to apply it. For large areas of water, a sprayer should be used to cover the entire surface. (5) Empty cans, water jars, and flower vases that collect water should be emptied once a week. Even water troughs for chickens and dogs should be washed and refilled once a week. (6) All useless small ponds, empty pools, and low-lying areas that can collect rainwater must be filled in or drained. (7) All wells, cisterns, water tanks, and various water storage containers must be fitted with tin lids to prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs in them. (8) Any areas of standing water where kerosene cannot be applied should be stocked with small fish (such as goldfish and spiny fish) that can eat the larvae. (9) Keep an eye out for standing or leaking water in drainage ditches and downspouts. Even covered wells and tanks should be inspected regularly for leaks or damage. All water leaks, ditches, pools, and other places should be checked frequently. While applying kerosene, be sure to search along the way for various water channels and puddles to ensure they are cleaned. (10) Kerosene should be poured wherever mosquitoes lay their eggs or where they can lay their eggs. All kinds of aquatic plants, weeds near wells and ponds, and water holes that can provide shelter for mosquitoes should be regularly cleared. In vacant lots or courtyards, bricks, tiles, bottles, and cans that can collect rainwater should also be diligently removed. (11) In areas where many mosquitoes congregate, mosquito coils can be burned to eliminate them. Dead mosquitoes should be collected and burned. (12) All residents of the concession should actively work to eliminate mosquitoes, starting with their own homes and then helping neighbors to clear mosquito breeding grounds. The success of this summer's mosquito eradication efforts depends entirely on the enthusiasm and mutual assistance of residents within the concession. The Health Department of this Bureau always has kerosene available for public needs. Anyone can come and claim it. (For any questions regarding the above mosquito eradication work, please contact the Health Bureau at No. 840 Xujiahui Road.)</p>
<p>Garbage Disposal Regulations</p>
<p>Each household in the French Concession should provide itself with a light, covered garbage can in its main or secondary building for the purpose of dumping the day's household garbage. The Bureau has a model garbage can for sale, which all households can purchase. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Bureau and the property owner, all garbage collectors employed by the Bureau are not allowed to enter private residences, private roads, or alleys. Each household should move its garbage can to the roadside in the early morning when the garbage truck passes by. The garbage inside the garbage can should be emptied by the Bureau's collectors. It is not allowed to dump garbage on public roads, vacant land, or in rivers. Do not move the garbage can to the roadside before the garbage truck has passed. Do not leave the garbage can on the roadside after the garbage truck has passed. The Bureau may, at the request of the landlord, clean up the garbage in private roads and alleys, but the landlord must pay a handling fee in advance every six months. The amount of this fee should be equal to 4% of the total monthly rent of all the houses in that location. The garbage truck's operating hours are as follows: From April 1st to September 30th each year, from 5:00 AM to 8:00 AM; From October 1st to March 31st of the following year, from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM. Each garbage truck has a bell that rings as it passes to alert residents. Anyone who violates these regulations will be fined from one to five yuan. Repeat offenders may be fined double. (Note) The term "garbage" refers to the kitchen waste and dust collected from the home. Leaves from the garden, animal feces, or bricks and soil should not be considered garbage and should be removed by the residents themselves. The Bureau would like to remind all residents of the French Concession to be aware of the many harms of dumping garbage on the road (such as breeding flies and toxic bacteria). It is hoped that all residents of the concession will abide by the regulations in good faith.</p>

<p>The Social Affairs Bureau had previously imposed limits on the price of flour due to the soaring market price, believing that speculators were manipulating it.  The limits were set at 3.05 yuan for goods delivered in July, August, and September, 3.08 yuan for October, 3.11 yuan for November, and 3.14 yuan for December, and prices were not allowed to exceed these limits.  However, due to active sales to other areas, prices soared, so the bureau submitted a request for a grace period, which was approved.  The bureau announced yesterday: "We have now received instruction No. 6767 from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, approving the temporary granting of grace periods for the monthly trading limits on goods in the market, with new regulations to be followed. We must all comply. Any transactions exceeding these price limits will not be recorded in the market accounts.  In addition to posting these instructions, this announcement is made." At the same time, another announcement stated: "Starting today, this month's trading will only be settled, and no new purchases will be made. This announcement is made." The Social Affairs Bureau also replied to a letter from the bureau's council yesterday, saying: "Received and noted.  It is stated that the original clients have been persuaded to automatically settle within the limits, and that the current flour market is active due to sales to other areas, causing prices to gradually rise.  This is indeed the case and should be taken into consideration. The price limits for goods delivered in July, August, and September should be temporarily raised to 3.12 yuan, and the limits for October, November, and December should be 3.15 yuan, 3.18 yuan, and 3.21 yuan, respectively. All market prices must still not exceed the above limits. The request to cancel the price limits is temporarily denied." Therefore, all goods traded yesterday were bought and sold at the prices set by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>Yao Jinbao, an old maid from Kunshan, 39 years old, lived at No. 52 Caojiazhai, North Jisi Feier Road, West Shanghai. She vowed never to marry and made a living by chanting scriptures and praying for others. Unfortunately, around 9:00 PM the night before last, while returning home, she tripped and fell on the ground at the entrance of the Lu Xuezhai Yong'an Lane. Her neck hit a stone, and she bled profusely. Her neck suffered excessive impact, causing her to lose consciousness and die on the spot. Because there were few pedestrians in the area, it was not until yesterday morning that someone discovered her and reported it to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, which then reported it to the local court. The court sent Prosecutor Kong to the scene at around 10:00 AM to examine the body. It was confirmed that Yao Jinbao had fallen and injured her head, which caused her death. Neighbors in the area contributed money to provide for her burial.</p>

<p>Having read today's report in your esteemed newspaper, on page 4, in the Wupu News column, there is a case of bandits robbing. The victim, Gu Yaosheng, was shot by robbers, injuring his left leg. The time of the incident and the circumstances of the robbery are inconsistent with the facts. It has been found that our office has already summoned the victim, Gu Yaosheng, for questioning. According to his statement, "Today at 3:10 PM, two robbers broke into the Gu Yaosheng Garden owned by me one after another, searching and robbing $18 in banknotes and $2 in silver coins. When leaving, they stabbed my left leg and both hands with a small kitchen knife. After escaping eastward, I went directly to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The robbers did not carry guns," etc. Accordingly, we are writing to request correction. Respectfully addressed to the Shenbao Newspaper Office, the Xujiahui Police Station of the Caojiadu Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Sincerely, July 18. Having read today's report in your esteemed newspaper, there is a news item about a British sailor beating a rickshaw puller to death. The facts are different. The points that should be corrected are as follows: (1) Your newspaper reported that Chen Huizhang died from a skull fracture after being hit in the head by a drunken British sailor. In fact, the British sailor was not drunk. After the incident, the reports in various newspapers did not mention drunkenness either. (2) The statement that the deceased's family, Chen Zhangshi, entrusted the Shanghai Rickshaw Mutual Aid Society to "negotiate for compensation" has been investigated. Yesterday afternoon, colleagues from our association personally went to the society to inquire. At that time, Mr. Xu Jieli, an executive of the society, replied that this mediation was not based on the initiative of the Rickshaw Mutual Aid Society, but rather he acted in his personal capacity to mediate and settle the case for 500 yuan. (3) The statement that the perpetrator in the case has left Shanghai with the warship is not accurate. The sailor was detained by the Public Works Department after the incident on the morning of the 8th of this month, and the procurator of the court strictly ordered the police to handle the case according to the law. The newspaper's casual statement is an inaccurate rumor. (4) It has been found that the representatives who went to the association yesterday afternoon were representatives and lawyers from the Jianghuai Compatriot Support Association for the Case of the British Sailor's Brutal Murder of Chen Huizhang, not representatives of the Jianghuai Compatriot Association. (5) Regarding the negotiation results, the representatives raised a "protest" because they did not pay attention to the entire national issue. Based on the above facts, there are many discrepancies, and it concerns the entire national system of China, so it cannot be confused with untruthful rumors. Therefore, we specially request your newspaper to make corrections and pray that the original letter will be published. Respectfully addressed to the chief editor of the Shenbao Newspaper Office. Sincerely, the Support Association for the Case of the British Sailor's Brutal Murder of Chen Huizhang, July 18, 1936.</p>

The standing councilors should formulate selection methods based on the following principles and submit them to the meeting for review: (A) The selection criteria should be based on the past achievements of each troop.

<p>— He Jirou</p>
<p>Educators today are all paying attention to the issue of students' future paths, because students' future paths are an important indicator of the effectiveness of education. Especially middle school educators are more concerned about the issue of graduation and further studies or employment, because middle school students feel these two issues most deeply, and appropriate solutions are even more related to the overall effectiveness of education. Therefore, those who advocate guidance pay more attention to the guidance of middle school students in further studies and employment.</p>
<p>There are only two paths for middle school students: further studies and employment. Ideally, graduates of vocational schools and normal schools should naturally all be employed. However, in reality, there are always a few who, due to various circumstances, change their career plans and seek higher knowledge, so there is also the issue of further studies. As for ordinary middle schools, they are originally intended to prepare students for further studies, but among the graduates, there are inevitably various difficulties that prevent them from continuing their education and require them to enter society to make a living. Therefore, the employment issue still exists. The nature of these two issues is continuous, and some of the principles for solving them are common, so they can be discussed together.</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education announced the "Measures for Guidance on Further Studies and Employment in Primary and Secondary Schools" in the 22nd year, attention to guidance work in various places has increased a lot. Many schools are working hard to implement it and are proceeding in accordance with the key points set by the ministry. However, it is feared that not many can fully implement all the matters listed in the measures, or perhaps none. (The China Vocational Education Society is currently investigating the implementation of guidance in secondary schools.) There are naturally some schools that have achieved considerable results in implementing guidance, but there are also quite a few that have not achieved any results. The reasons for the limited achievements are roughly due to several incorrect ideas:</p>
<p>1. Perfunctory Response: Some who implement guidance work do not recognize the importance of this work and do not have the determination to implement it. Since the educational administrative organs have orders, they have no choice but to respond perfunctorily to fulfill their responsibilities. They either organize committees, or hold lectures, or have other activities, but all of these are just materials to be reported. They do not grasp the essentials of student guidance and do not implement it effectively, so the results are superficial and almost zero.</p>
<p>2. Superficial Publicity: Some education officials have no research on guidance work and fail to understand its meaning and important methods. However, upon hearing someone advocate guidance work, they think it is novel, or seeing other schools organize guidance programs, they are motivated by a competitive mentality. So they also add some guidance activities as embellishments and publicity materials. As for the real benefits that students gain, they cannot be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>3. Temporary First Aid: Some educators believe that guidance work is a temporary relief effort specifically for the period close to graduation. When the issue of students' future paths becomes urgent near graduation, attention is drawn to guidance. Lectures are held, contacts are made, senior school situations are investigated, and they have to be busy for a while. However, after the graduation period, they put this matter aside again, thinking it is not important.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned concepts naturally arise because the meaning and nature of guidance work are not fundamentally recognized. The important and valuable aspects of guidance implementation cannot be distinguished. If this continues, guidance work will not be effective and will not make progress. All advocacy will become empty talk, and all implementation will become blind. To correct the several incorrect concepts mentioned above, there are several principles regarding guidance that should be specially mentioned here:</p>
<p>1. Guidance is Part of Education: Guidance on further studies or employment is often thought of as work outside of formal education. In reality, guidance is education. Schools implement education in order to cultivate talents. If students cannot receive proper further education, and those seeking employment cannot find suitable careers, the effectiveness of education can be considered completely lost. All educational activities are meaningless. Therefore, guidance work must be carried out in conjunction with other educational activities and become an equally important part.</p>
<p>2. Guidance is Everyday Work: Guidance on further studies and employment is needed when facing the issue of future paths, and the issue of future paths superficially belongs to a certain time. Therefore, some people think that guidance work is also seasonal and that holding it once every summer vacation is enough. Although the actual solution of future paths is near graduation, the success of guidance depends entirely on the facilities established on weekdays. It cannot be obtained by sharpening the spear just before the battle, because to solve the problem of further studies or employment, it is necessary to understand the individual's past and present situation, as well as the situation of schools and occupations. And the method of handling it requires a lot of long-term preparation, which cannot be completed temporarily. Therefore, guidance work is long-term, continuous, and proceeds simultaneously with everyday education.</p>
<p>3. Guidance Emphasizes Individual Treatment: The methods of guidance work can be divided into group and individual in terms of organization. Common guidance for the majority of people, such as publications and lectures, can be said to be group guidance. Individual treatment according to the individual's situation and problems can be called individual guidance. Although group guidance cannot be considered ineffective, it will produce very little results if it is not supplemented by individual guidance. Individual guidance is the center of the work and cannot be eliminated, so it should be given special emphasis.</p>
<p>By affirming these principles, the several incorrect concepts mentioned earlier can naturally be corrected. Other principles do not need to be discussed here. But after recognizing the meaning and importance of guidance, how should it be implemented? What are some things that should be implemented in order to solve the problem of students' further studies and employment? The answer to this question is very broad, and many have already been listed in the outline of the methods set by the Ministry of Education, which are very thorough. This article does not intend to offer a complete answer, but only briefly explains several basic tasks for secondary schools to assist students in solving the problem of further studies and employment.

<h3 id="e151">Before the Opening of the World Games: A Grand Celebration Performance Will Be Held: Featuring Six Kinds of Singing and Dancing Programs; 10,000 Adults and Tens of Thousands of Children Will Participate <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin News) The World Olympic Games, which will be held in Berlin in August of this year, has been prepared by Dr. Nitzsche-Gerhard to hold a large-scale celebration meeting, which is scheduled to be performed on the opening day. In the past, Dr. Gerhard has been responsible for the preparation of the Hant Memorial Meeting in Göttingen, the National Day Memorial Meeting in Heidelberg, etc. Later, he served as a director at the New York City Opera for three years. After returning to China, he served as the preparation of the Cologne National Day Memorial Meeting and founded the National Grand Theater in 1934.</p>
<p>This celebration performance was suggested by Sir Corbden. 12,000 adults and tens of thousands of children will participate in the performance. There are six types of programs, ranging from children's games to solemn singing. This kind of performance cannot be limited to gymnastics, but it cannot be too literary. The most difficult part is the problem of the scenery. It is difficult to avoid various difficulties when performing artistic singing and dancing in a sports field. For example, props, lighting, etc. must be designed by experts in order to be suitable for a large audience. In addition, designed by architectural experts, the venue will be divided into several parts, so that the oval venue becomes a circular or square stage to suit the artistic performance. At the same time, the use of light, color and scenery will make the venue undergo various changes.</p>
<p>The first act of the performance is "Olympic Flag Dance," which uses children's dance movements to perform the shape of the Olympic flag.</p>
<p>The second act is "Solemnity and Purity," in which 2,100 girls participate in the performance. First, a girl decorated as "Baruca" performs a waltz, followed by 500 female students from Berlin universities performing various games with wooden balls, iron rings, and pointed sticks.</p>
<p>The third act is "Work and Games," in which 2,000 students and representatives from various countries participate in the performance. The scenery is the camping life of various countries. Representatives from various countries sing their national folk songs, which are broadcast throughout the venue through loudspeakers and illuminated by searchlights. Finally, children from various countries parade around the venue for a week, and three Swiss children's consuls lead a flag exercise of 1,200 people.</p>
<p>The fourth act is "Strength and Agility," performed by 1,000 soldiers and 500 athletes, including mechanical exercises, javelin, and iron ball items.</p>
<p>The fifth act is "Victory," performed by sixty of Germany's best male dancers. The dancers are dressed as two teams of warriors. The two leaders hold a sword fight. Finally, the warrior decorated by Gotzburg is defeated by the sword. Then, eighty dancers led by Mary Wigman come out and dance, placing the dead at the feet of the victor. Finally, the Berlin Grand Orchestra plays "The Olympic Song." All the singing groups in Berlin lead the dancers and children holding torches into the venue. At the same time, the flags and emblems of various countries are arranged in a circle around the venue, and the space is interwoven with strong searchlights to form patterns. In the sound of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, combined with the song "Joy—the Bright Light of God's Daughter," the horns are full, and the cheers are resounding. In the meantime, the solemn bell of "The Olympic Bell" seems to tell people that "I will awaken the youth of the world."</p>

<h3 id="e161">Cotton Yarn: Multiple Parties Driving Up Prices, Marked Yarn Closes with a Sudden Rise <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>In the cotton yarn market this morning, the market was initially restrained due to the global cotton yarn situation trending downward. At the same time, spot yarn demand was weak, causing general retail investors to sell off and the market to decline. In the afternoon, due to a sharp rise in old cotton, multiple parties came in to drive up prices. By the time of the third closing, the market had turned to soar.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Rises More Than One Yuan Recently</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened this morning with prices falling across the board due to the overseas cotton yarn market situation. The decline intensified, and retail investors in the market unanimously bearishly sold off, with each falling by 8 jiao to 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 fen. After a consolidation in the second session, it was heard that old cotton was firm, and prices suddenly rebounded by 1 yuan to 8 jiao, 9 fen. The third closing showed weakness due to the lack of spot yarn business and a sharp drop of 23 yuan in Osaka Sampin yarn. As a result, each month's closing price fell by 2, 3, 5, 6 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was affected by the sharp plunge of the July and August marked cotton contracts in the morning, with the near-term contracts falling by 3 jiao, 9 fen, and the distant contracts falling by 2, 3, 4 jiao. The second session was flat. Nearing the second closing, the rise in old cotton was rampant, and multiple parties continued to drive up prices. Securities firms absorbed more actively, and the market suddenly turned upward. The closing rise was increasingly strong, closing at the highest price. As a result, near-term contracts rose by 8, 9 jiao to 1 yuan, 2 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and distant contracts rose by 7 jiao to 1 yuan, 1 jiao. It was found that Yu Da sold 1,000 bales, Yu Kang 800 bales, Cheng Ji 700 bales, Da Ji 1,050 bales, Zhen Da 700 bales, He Xing 600 bales, Da Changcheng 1,200 bales, Xie Cheng 850 bales, Sheng Yuan 800 bales, Tong He 1,250 bales, Ren Feng 1,200 bales, Yuan Yi 800 bales, Yi Cheng 950 bales, Run Kang 1,100 bales, and Tong Ji bought 2,050 bales, Ju Xing 1,150 bales, Ming De 1,650 bales, Feng Tai 1,800 bales, Shen Ji 1,400 bales, Da Chang 900 bales, He Xing 1,150 bales, and Jin Chang 900 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Still Slow</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still mediocre, with a total of 645 bales sold. Prices are firm. The purchase amounts by various groups are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e162">Old Cotton Rises More Than One Yuan <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The old cotton market situation is extremely turbulent, with the magnitude of fluctuations being quite alarming. There is a very large organization behind this situation. Once there is a change, the waves are overwhelming. The actions of the multiple parties are confusing, rising and falling suddenly, causing people to fall into a fog. The fluctuations are often between 7, 8 jiao and 1 yuan, which is rare in the market for many years. Since the beginning of the week, the margin for the July marked cotton contracts has been 6 yuan per dan for national special grade, totaling 18 yuan before, and 15 yuan before for the August contracts, which shows the severity of the market situation.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Near-Term Firm, Distant-Term Stable</p>
<p>Before the opening of the marked cotton market, the market unanimously predicted a decline of 4, 5 jiao (because American cotton continued to be quoted at 15 to 17 points, Indian cotton also fell 2 rupees 25 to 3 rupees and a half, and the decline in Osaka Sampin cotton was particularly sharp, falling nearly 1 yuan). Unexpectedly, old cotton opened with July contracts rising by 7 jiao and August contracts rising by 4 jiao. New cotton was affected by foreign cotton and fell to the 50 yuan mark. According to the market, multiple parties convened a meeting last night to resolutely take delivery of old cotton and continue to drag it in. The first session purchased 5,000 dan, paying a special certificate of 4 yuan and a half per dan, with the rest being advanced by the brokers themselves. Therefore, people's hearts were raised and ascended. By the third session, Ming De, Feng Tai, and Chang Feng suddenly sold off a large amount, and the market suddenly loosened. The amount was over 13,000 dan. Unexpectedly, the high price caused long positions to close, and it was reported that Japanese merchants were working hard to sell off, causing a tragic fall of 1 yuan to 1 yuan and 2 jiao at the close. New cotton followed suit and fell. As a result, July marked cotton rose by 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, August fell by 8 jiao, and new cotton fell by 4 jiao and a half to 5 jiao and a half. In the afternoon opening, Feng Tai, Ming De, and He Xing bought wildly in the near-term contracts, and the number of chips suddenly appeared to be exhausted. Feng Tai rushed in at market prices and shouted prices wildly, so prices were raised mutually. July jumped up by 6 jiao, August jumped by 1 yuan and 3 jiao, and new cotton was peaceful. In the second and third sessions, prices advanced steadily and returned to 50 yuan. The closing price rebounded slightly by 5 fen. As a result, the July and August marked cotton contracts rose by 1 yuan 5 fen to 1 yuan 6 jiao and a half compared to the morning closing price, and new cotton rose by 4 jiao and a half to 5 jiao and a half. Feng Tai sold 15,000 dan in the morning and uniquely advanced 23,700 dan in the afternoon. It was found that Sheng Yuan sold 4,900 dan, Chang He 2,600 dan, Run Kang 4,000 dan, Yi Chang 2,600 dan, Heng De 1,500 dan, Tai Chang 1,900 dan, Yuan Yi 1,100 dan, Heng De 1,500 dan, Chang Yu 1,300 dan, Ju Xing 1,300 dan, Heng Yi 3,400 dan, Da Feng 6,200 dan, Jin Chang 4,300 dan, Ming De 13,400 dan, Feng Tai 15,000 dan, Zhen Ji 8,400 dan, Da Changcheng 3,600 dan, Chang Feng 18,200 dan, Zhen Da 1,900 dan, and Geng Yi 1,500 dan. Feng Tai bought 23,700 dan, Sen Kang 3,800 dan, Ming De 8,900 dan, Jin Chang 2,900 dan, Tong Ji 2,100 dan, Yu Da 10,600 dan, He Xing 5,800 dan, Geng Feng 2,800 dan, Tai Chang 11,300 dan, Yi Chang 16,300 dan, Run Kang 12,300 dan, Da Chang 3,600 dan, and Tong He 1,900 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Sales Extremely Quiet</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still quiet, and factory stomachs are sluggish. The source is Yao cotton, with 752 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e163">US Cotton Report Expected to Be Smooth, Prices All Fall… Sampin Also Weak <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with prices falling 5 to 6 points for each month. Long positions were closed, and foreign firms, local groups, and New Orleans all sold off. The East Coast continued to have rain, and the harvest in Texas was good. The next government report is expected to be smooth, which are all reasons for the fall in market prices. Subsequently, fellow traders bought in on the dips, and there was a slight improvement. However, demand was stagnant, and a new stimulus seemed to be needed. Before the close, short covering met with further selling. Spot prices fell 17 points, and futures fell 10 to 17 points. Although there were sales of stored cotton and loan cotton, spot prices were still expensive. Textile products were slightly stagnant due to hesitant buyers. British spot cotton fell 5 points, and futures fell 8, 9 points. Qilu cotton futures traders and long positions sold off, and operators dumped large quantities. However, European exporters and spot traders bought in. Pingguo fell 3.25 to 3.5 rupees, Aomla fell 2.25 to 2.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 2.75 to 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegraph from the 17th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for April and May Bai Luoxi cotton on the 18th was 220 rupees, down 4 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<p>According to an Osaka telegram on the 18th, Sampin futures yarn fell 2 jiao to 3 yuan and 3 jiao. Near-term was 211 yuan and 6 jiao, and distant-term was 205 yuan and 6 jiao. Cotton futures fell 1 yuan and 5 fen to 1 yuan and 8 jiao fen. Near-term was 70 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen, and distant-term was 64 yuan and 6 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Food: Flour Price Limit Increased, But Most Long Positions Still Insist on Not Selling <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market has announced that the standard has changed the market value, from July to September, the same limit will be increased by 7 fen, and for October and below, it will be increased by 3 fen. With this increase in the market, according to common sense, long positions should want to get rid of it. However, the current spot flour factory price is still between 1 jiao and a half, so although the price has increased, there is no formal transaction. When the auction reached August, the limit price was 1 jiao and 2 fen, but many long positions were selling off, so it was once as low as 1 jiao fen 2 li and a half. However, this situation soon stopped, because most long positions were still holding on. By the afternoon opening, trading in the market was quiet again. It was heard that the Tianjin gang was very greedy for spot flour, and this month's new limit price was also done in the dark, with rumors of 2 fen to 2 fen and a half. It is also rumored that the distant period will be increased by 1, 2 fen, but it cannot be reliably proven.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Wheat Futures Slightly Driven Up by Flour <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, the various months generally trended stable again. The quotation for foreign wheat was reported. Although Chicago was slightly 3, 4 jiao, Canada was good for 8 fen to 1 jiao. However, because the flour market's price limit was re-announced and increased by the Social Bureau, people's hearts in the market could not help but take care. This month's opening price was good for 5 fen, and the other months rose by 3, 5 fen, etc. Trading in each session was also brisk. By the time of the afternoon opening, the opening price of spot wheat was not good, and factory stomachs were not greedy, only each had a price shout, and it was slightly softer, only 2, 3 fen better than the previous day. According to the meaning of people in the industry, the current price of wheat is similar to the market value of brown rice, so speculators should be cautious. In the spot wheat market, high-quality goods raised 2 fen, and medium-quality goods were as usual. Henan wheat opened at 4 yuan and 5 jiao, Liuhe wheat at 4 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, Danyang wheat at 4 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, Wuyi wheat at 4 yuan and 4 jiao and 8 fen, Gaoyou wheat at 4 yuan and 4 jiao and 7 fen, Yaowan old wheat at 4 yuan and 6 jiao, Zhang Baling Shahe wheat at 4 yuan and 5 jiao 3 fen, Quanjiao 4 yuan and 4 jiao 8 fen, Jiangbei wheat 4 yuan and 4 jiao 5, 6 fen, Bengbu wheat 4 yuan and 5 jiao 2 fen, Guangshui wheat 4 yuan and 4 jiao 1 fen, Jiangxi wheat 4 yuan and 3 jiao, Hankou wheat 4 yuan and 3 jiao 3 fen, Wuhu wheat 4 yuan and 3 jiao 3 fen, second-grade, Yangzhou 4 yuan and 3 jiao, second-grade 2 jiao and a half, Fu 10,000 bags were handled, and Shen Da handled 3,000 bags.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs only arrived at more than ten numbers, with nearly 2,000 piculs of goods in total, so people's hearts were slightly. Sales in this street slightly moved, but the bao stomach only handled more than 200 bags from the Nanyang gang, while Houzao japonica and Bo rice prices have become tight, several gongs, Du Yangjian and Yinbian yuan are all flat.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange, because Guangdong has been resolved, those who got the news earlier had already partially covered in the previous day, and retail investors still had quite a few short coverings and long positions. The large households took the opportunity to pull up prices, so they continued to rise. Fortunately, during the brewing period, the short side had already made up most of it, and the rest were mostly those with spot goods. Therefore, although the market price continued to rise, there was no great prosperity. In fact, because the market price was too high, the Type A was only a few corners away from the highest peak, so the multi-party outflow was also expected. Most of the market prices in August saw new high prices. Even if they continue to rise, they are limited. Yesterday's experience showed that the opening rise was the strongest, and No. 4 and No. 11 took the opportunity to raise prices again. Retail investors were even more flustered. However, after quietly observing the market, the multi-party was already in the exit cage. The market price suddenly rose by 7, 9 jiao, but after entering, the rise gradually subsided, and Type B only rose by 2 jiao and a half. The closing gradually became unsustainable, and most of them fell more and rose less. As a result, the market price uniformly continued to rise by 3, 4 jiao to 1 yuan 5 fen, etc. The total number of transactions was 9.5 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed on the left. (Unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan)</p>

However, it was for transit goods at 6 yuan 8 jiao and a half, which was less than 5 jiao. The domestic Chaoshan sugar, due to the sudden fall of the Shantou exchange rate of 40 to 50 yuan, the market continued to be tight.

<p>Yesterday, the cotton fabric market saw improved sentiment among Cantonese merchants due to hopes for peace in the southwest situation and the sharp rise in the Cantonese currency.  Cantonese merchants, known for their strong sales in the region of native fine twills, inquired about prices, leading to a slightly more active market. Although sales prices have not officially increased, asking prices have risen by about five cents.  Yesterday, over 300 bales of fine twills from this factory and over 200 bales of fine and coarse cloth from this factory were brought in.  The market saw brisk sales only for fine twills from this factory and lower-grade fine cloth from this factory, while other domestic textiles remained weak.

<p>Yesterday, exports of Qimen floral fragrance black tea to England revived. The Jardine Matheson trading company purchased over 600 boxes at a price of 34-35 yuan, a decrease of 6-7 yuan from the previous price. However, the black tea market still lacks significant improvement. Chun Mei green tea sales remain active, with Xiehe, Tongfu, Jinlong, Baochang, and other firms purchasing large quantities. Needle Mei and pearl tea also sold well, while Gongxi green tea remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the Tea Merchants' Association report, various grades of Chun Mei sold well this week. Due to the superior quality of newly arrived tea, prices for previously stored tea have become firm, and ongoing purchases by various firms have resulted in low inventory. An estimated 5,200 boxes of Chun Mei, 1,600 boxes of premium Chun Zhen, and 2,000 boxes of Xiu Mei were sold. Other types such as Gongxi and Xia Mu also performed well. In the past two days, English and European firms have paid close attention to the top-grade Zhuang Shui Dou Chun Mei. Tunxi's famous Chun Mei was offered by Xiehe at 118 yuan, and Zheng Yuan Jia Xin's top-grade Zhuang Chun Mei was offered by European firms at 116 yuan. Zhengxi, known for its excellent craftsmanship, was priced at 90 yuan, and its sub-grade was priced at 70 yuan. The tea market is optimistic about the prospects for Zhuang teas this year. Ping Shui tea and various pearl teas also saw high transaction volumes this week, with Jinlong and Jardine Matheson making substantial purchases totaling 5,000 boxes, and their prices also increased slightly. However, American firms are more critical of the craftsmanship and soup quality of Zhuang teas this year, making it easier to promote high-grade Zhuang teas.</p>

<p>— Xie Yun</p>
<p>Little friends, another year has passed, and it's summer vacation again. You have temporarily left your kind teachers and classmates and returned home. During these long two months, I think you must feel very lonely. Therefore, I am now preparing a summer work plan for you to spend these two months.</p>
<p>The first plan: Publicize the national crisis. The current critical situation of our China has reached a point of extreme urgency. Due to the lack of universal education, the peasants, who account for 50% of the national population, are still unaware of the situation. Little friends, during your summer vacation leisure time, you should organize a small teacher group to publicize the national crisis and methods to save the country to the peasants in the countryside. Your sincere and innocent attitude will surely arouse their enthusiasm for saving the country!</p>
<p>The second plan: Exercise your body. Summer is the time for our outdoor life, and it is also the best opportunity to exercise our body. Cold water baths and ball sports can make our body very healthy. Healthy spirit resides in a healthy body. May little friends not forget this saying!</p>
<p>The third plan: Review old lessons. When summer vacation arrives, your studies have come to an end. When the autumn semester begins, you will step into another new stage. "Reviewing the old can lead to new knowledge." The lessons you have learned in the past are your basic knowledge, and you should review them regularly to become proficient and apply them easily, so you won't feel any difficulty when advancing your studies!</p>
<p>Little friends, please try your best to implement the above three small plans!</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Childhood of Russian Literary Master Gorky <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>On the 18th of last month, Russian literary master Gorky passed away in a village near Moscow. Gorky was a Soviet revolutionary literary master and a figure admired by the worldwide cultural community. We were all saddened by his death. Little friends! Brothers and sisters who read the newspaper every day may know that he died of an epidemic, but I will give a brief report on his life during his childhood, and introduce his life story below:</p>
<p>Gorky's father was a carpenter named Maxentius Pescov, and his mother was the daughter of a laundry shop, named Fuffala Gasilin, who lived in Nizhny Novgorod. He was born on March 28, 1868, originally named Alesey Pescov. Later, his family moved to Astrakhan. At the age of five, his father died there, and a younger brother named Wu Hua was born at the same time. Later, his mother remarried. He suffered humiliation at school. When he was ten years old, his mother died. He was then introduced by his grandfather to work as an apprentice in a shoe store. He ran away because he couldn't stand the hardship. He was then recommended by his grandfather to work as a helper in an illustrator's house, and then as an apprentice in a handmade shop. At the age of eleven, he ran away again. At the age of twelve, he wandered to work as a small worker on a Volga River boat, where he met the cook Smolly, who gave him a large number of books to read, and he gained a lot of benefits. Later, he was falsely accused of being a thief by jealous colleagues, and he lost his job again. He returned to the illustrator's house and was beaten. At the age of thirteen, he went to work as an apprentice in an idol shop. At the age of fourteen, he wanted to go to Persia. On the way, he met the former illustrator, who helped him supervise the construction of a house. At the age of fifteen, he went to Kazan, wanting to enter university, but was unsuccessful. He spent a night hungry in a collapsed house in a storm. Later, he worked in a cake shop and attempted suicide with a pistol because of love, injuring his lungs. He recovered after a month. At this time, he realized the truth and went to work as a night watchman at a train station. Later, he worked as a clerk at a lawyer's office. In 1892, at the age of twenty-four, he published his first novel, "MacArthur Chutla," in the local Caucasus Daily, and gradually gained recognition in the literary world under his first single name—Gorky. He served as an editor of tabloids, and his articles gained the sympathy of the general public. During the revolutionary period, he presided over the New Life Daily, and after going through many difficulties, he wrote a total of one hundred and dozens of books, and lived to the age of sixty-eight.</p>
<p>Now he is a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. Just think about a child from such a poor family who can achieve today's status. Little friends! Gorky is the most outstanding artist; practitioner; enthusiastic revolutionary; and literary master; the most perfect "typical figure" for global people. He is truly a person worthy of admiration and worship!</p>
<h3 id="e181">Monkey <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Mei</p>
<p>Yong'er was "doing nothing but writing large and small characters and flipping through books every day" during the summer vacation. He was very lonely, so he wanted to visit some of his little friends. On this afternoon, the weather was very good. He first went to his friend Min'er's house to play. The two talked and talked very happily. After a while, they walked into Min'er's garden, where chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, sheep, and cows were raised. In the wooden fence on the left, there were two gray-black monkeys. Yong'er was very happy, so he asked Min'er, "Where did these two monkeys come from? They're so cute!" Min'er replied, "My dad gave them to me. My dad said they are produced in the central part of our country, which is a long way from here."</p>
<p>"Then what do they eat?" "They like to eat fruits and insects and are not carnivores like cats." "What are their teeth like?" "Their teeth are similar to human teeth and can be divided into three types: molars, which have flat and wide tops suitable for grinding food; canines, which have pointed and round shapes suitable for tearing food; and incisors, which have flat shapes suitable for cutting food." "How are they different from humans?" "The differences between them and humans can be summarized as follows: human facial bones are larger than monkey facial bones; human muzzles do not protrude outwards, while monkey muzzles do protrude outwards; humans have no tails, while monkeys have very short tails; and humans do not climb trees, and their buttocks have no calluses or cheek pouches; but monkeys have sharp claws that allow them to climb trees, and their buttocks have calluses and cheek pouches, which are temporary storage places for food." "Then what do they have in common with humans?" "The similarities between them and humans can also be divided into a few points: humans need to be nurtured by the mother's milk, and have four limbs, each with five fingers, with five flat claws, and the forelimbs can grasp objects, and there is a pair of breasts on the chest, and the ear shells are flat, and the brain is very developed. Monkeys also have the same characteristics."</p>

<p>——Fun During Summer Vacation</p>
<p>(1) Er'er had nothing to do during the summer vacation, so he wanted to help with the family's production; therefore, he went up the mountain early in the morning to collect firewood. After chopping for a while, he felt tired, so he wanted to take a rest.</p>
<p>(2) Fei'er also wanted to help with the family's production, so he also went to the mountain early in the morning to hunt. He used a rope, so he couldn't catch anything for a long time.</p>
<p>(3) He watched Rong'er sitting and resting in a daze and proudly, and thought to himself: "I'll lasso him!" So he threw the rope over.</p>
<p>(4) Sure enough, Rong'er was lassoed. He tightened the rope and said with a smile, "Caught a person!" He didn't expect that as soon as he finished saying this, he suddenly fell upside down! It turned out that he tightened the rope, and the rope was cut off by the firewood chopping knife!</p>

<p>— Sha Ou</p>
<p>Healthy parents can definitely pay attention to cultivating healthy children. Unhealthy parents should pay even more attention to the development of their children's bodies.</p>
<p>In general, parents in middle-class families are busy with their jobs and burdened by family affairs, and they work hard all year round without any holidays. Although schools give long vacations, parents are still unable to spend a leisurely life with their children. How many families can accompany each other to Lushan, Qingdao, Putuo, or Moganshan? Aren't they still confined in that dusty, sultry, and scorching hot cauldron?</p>
<p>Children who are confined to school life all year round should take advantage of their vacations to spend more time outdoors, cultivate a full and healthy spirit, and then continue to work hard on their studies. Parents who work hard all year round should take some time to take their children on a leisurely holiday, restore their tired nerves, rejuvenate their energy for work, and enjoy some family happiness. It is also a way to cultivate a spirit of serving their children and society.</p>
<p>Here are a few healthy rules for holiday life, I hope parents and children themselves pay attention to them!</p>
<p>(1) Do not dress your children up in fancy clothes. Let them wear short shirts and short pants and move, run, and jump freely.</p>
<p>(2) Appropriate camping life is most needed by healthy children. The selection of campsites should pay attention to whether they are suitable for living; whether the location is high and dry; whether the sunlight is sufficient; whether the air is circulated; and whether the supply of drinks and food is convenient.</p>
<p>(3) If you are going to the seaside or lakeside for outdoor life, you should set off early in the morning so that you can enjoy a whole day of rest and recreation.</p>
<p>(4) When resting by the sea, you should not stay too late, and you should not eat too many snacks.</p>
<p>(5) Do not drink well water or spring water casually on the road to prevent unclean sources and cause diarrhea, typhoid fever, and other diseases.</p>
<p>(6) Pay special attention to food. All meats, vegetables, eggs, fruits, milk, etc. must be fresh and clean.</p>
<p>(7) In hot weather, it is not suitable to make excessive hiking trips.</p>
<p>(8) In hot and humid weather, it is not suitable for strenuous exercise.</p>
<p>(9) After settling down, you must plan a regular and varied activity plan.</p>
<p>(10) Driving out is also the most suitable summer life. You can comfortably enjoy the scenery in the wild and breathe fresh air by riding a bicycle or a convertible car.</p>
<p>In this way, we can have a happy, healthy, and meaningful holiday life.</p>

<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>Little friends: Doesn't our country have the ancient saying "climbing a tree to catch fish"? However, the facts tell us that there are only birds in the trees, where do the fish come from? So everyone takes this saying as a metaphor!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, there is such a thing as "climbing a tree to catch fish" in Japan! Beside Daiganji Temple in Soga Town, Chiba Prefecture, there is a very lush forest where there are many black cormorants with long necks and long beaks that build nests in the trees. Cormorants often perch on the branches to rest. Because there are many cormorants in the trees, the ground is covered with cormorant droppings. The children of the nearby residents often go to the forest to collect bird droppings to use as fertilizer for cultivating fields; in addition to picking up bird droppings, they also go there to pick up fish!</p>
<p>I think little friends must be wondering, thinking, how can there be fish in the trees? Isn't this strange? Originally, the forest is close to the sea, and the cormorants in the trees often fly to the sea to catch fish for food; sometimes they stay on the branches, and if they are not careful, the fish will break free from their mouths and fall to the ground, where the children pick them up. Sometimes the children make strange noises or clap their hands to scare them, so that they are frightened and suddenly drop the fish.</p>
<p>Little friends! Don't you think this way of catching fish is very unique and fun?</p>
<p>(Cormorants are a type of waterfowl that is quite skilled at swimming on the water surface to catch fish)</p>

<p>"Cicada?" "Cicada?" The cicada chirps until its lips and tongue are scorched, its propaganda skills are really not small; "Croak! "Croak!" The frog sticks out its white belly, and vigorously beats the war drum; mosquitoes carry barbed knives on their mouths, and flies keep whistling; enemy troops cannot be seen at night, and fireflies light up the electric lights; the dragonfly has a good figure, and performs airplanes to drop bombs; the mantis team dances with large knives; the mole cricket team digs trenches; the ants carry food and grass, working tirelessly all day long; The most gratifying thing is:——the spider's defense is really strict, the electric web is heavily guarded and the enemy cannot escape.</p>

<p>Dear Brother Jiabao:</p>
<p>"Why are Cub Scouts called Wolves?" We believe that many people are as doubtful as you are. It turns out that this novel title was bestowed on us by that old brother Baden-Powell who initiated the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a kind of red Indian in America. They had a strange custom: anyone in the tribe who had an independent character, a courageous spirit, a strong physique, and a habit of helping others, the tribe would give him a glorious badge. What is this badge? That's what we didn't expect. This is exactly the "wolf" we are talking about! The black people of Africa also have the same custom. They all like others to call themselves "wolves," and capable children are also called "little wolves." Their "wolves" are just like our Boy Scouts, and are considered to be healthy people. Therefore, our old brother called the Boy Scouts wolves, and the honorable title of "little wolf" was put on the heads of the Cub Scouts.</p>
<p>There is also a very interesting story that describes the story of a missing Indian child living with wild animals in the forest. This child's name is Mao Jili. He was looked after by a mother wolf and lived a wolf's life with the pack. There he learned many forest skills, and a bear and a leopard were his teachers. His life is full of adventures and brave deeds. There is a book that tells this story very interestingly. Our old brother used this book as the basis when he founded the Cub Scouts. Many of the Cub Scouts' activities are similar to the lives of real little wolves, and these little wolf lives are described very interestingly in that book. The book is called The Jungle Book and the author is Kipling.</p>
<p>This is how the Cub Scouts and the Wolves joined hands. In England, you can't find the word "Cub Scout." They are all called little wolves. In China, because there was already the name "Boy Scout," the name "Cub Scout" was followed when "Little Wolf" was held. But even now, the activities of Chinese Cub Scouts are no different from those of foreign little wolves.</p>
<p>Brother Jiabao, what do you think of the name "Little Wolf"? Tell us what you think. Please, I wish you as brave as a wolf!</p>
<p>Sincerely, China Boy Scout Self-Help Society</p>

<p>— Wang Suilan, fifth grader of Dongtai Experimental Elementary School</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. In a blink of an eye, it has been two weeks since the summer vacation started. But after the summer vacation, I became a teacher; it can be said that I have not wasted my precious time.</p>
<p>The sun is setting, and a touch of colorful clouds, like brocade, is swirling in the sky. The evening breeze is blowing gently. At this time, my mother and the aunts from the neighborhood are all gathering in the open space to enjoy the cool air. I took advantage of this time to teach them to recognize common characters. Now they can recognize more than fifty characters.</p>
<p>Little friends all over the country! Let's all get up and make good use of this long summer vacation; and be a teacher like me!</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>A large swath of snow-white light suddenly poured in from the darkness, covering the aisles of the chapel. It turned out that a bright moon had broken through the cloud cover and hung high in the sky. The snow had stopped, and the snow light reflected inside, like the dawn of day. The moonlight shone directly on the two holy images above Little Nello's head, as clear as when he lay down on them during the day.</p>
<p>Little Nello stood up, stretched out his arms towards the two holy images, the happy tear streaks on his pale face shining slightly, he shouted loudly: "I finally see them! Ah! God! I am completely satisfied."</p>
<p>His two legs finally couldn't support him. He knelt on the ground, his eyes still looking up at the two holy images he loved. The moonlight lingered on the holy images for a moment, particularly bright, particularly clear, particularly sweet and intense, as if shot down from heaven to make it convenient for Little Nello. Suddenly, the bright light disappeared again, and darkness covered the face of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Little Nello's arms tightened around Patrasche's body, and he murmured: "Let's go up and see his face again. I don't think he will separate us again, he is the most merciful."</p>
<p>The next day, the citizens of Antwerp found Little Nello and Patrasche next to the altar of the Great Church. They were both dead. The cold night air had frozen them both stiff, like stones. On this Christmas morning, when the priests came to the temple, they saw them lying on the stone steps of the altar. Above them, the curtain on the holy image of Ruben had been unveiled, and beams of sunlight were shining directly on the head of God.</p>
<p>Later, a stern-faced old man arrived, and seeing many women crying, he also sobbed and cried, murmuring, "I really mistreated this child. I must try my best to make up for it and repent of my sins in the future. Even though he is dead, I must still treat him as my own son."</p>
<p>Later, a world-famous old painter arrived and said to the crowd, "I am looking for a very talented child. The prize money from yesterday should be awarded to him. He painted an old woodcutter sitting on a fallen tree when the sunset was beautiful. Although this is a very simple painting, it can be seen that he has a great future. I wholeheartedly want to find him and teach him art wholeheartedly, and I will get the greatest harvest."</p>
<p>There was also a blonde girl, holding her father's arm, crying very sadly, shouting, "Ah! Nello! Come on! We have everything prepared for you. We have a lot of Christmas gifts. That old musician will also play the flute for us to add to the fun; mother also said she would let you stay and go back after the festival, then Patrasche will be so happy! Ah! Nello! Wake up quickly! Come with us"!</p>
<p>But Little Nello's pale face, looking up at the bright light on the holy image of Ruben, had a hint of a smile on his mouth, as if answering their words: "It's too late"!</p>
<p>Sweet bells were ringing on a cold day, the sunlight was shining on the snowy plains. The citizens were walking in the streets in teams happily, but Little Nello and Patrasche would no longer come to beg from them.</p>
<p>They were always together in life, and they would not be separated after death. Because people saw that the child's arms were tightly holding the dog's body, no one could separate them. The people in this small village were very ashamed and regretful, and they specially held a prayer service for them, and built a grave to lay them together—to sleep forever. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e189">How to Study Mathematics? <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— De Zhao</p>
<p>Our world is a world of matter; matter is composed of quantities, and therefore it can also be said that this world is a world of numbers. We see that the mountains and rivers of the natural world each have their own size, height, or length, all containing many substances and many quantities of substances. Looking at human society, the composition of countries and groups inevitably involves many members, and all production and consumption of people inevitably have certain quantities. At some point, we can say that all phenomena can be explained by numbers. As for our lives, they can be even more calculated with numbers, such as how much we earn and spend each month, how many hours we work and read each day, and how much time we rest. It can be said that everything can be calculated with numbers. The general terms arithmetic and mathematics are used to calculate phenomena related to the natural world, human society, and individual lives. They have real content and a material basis. Each number or digit can represent the quantity of something. For example, two plus three equals five, which is the representation of five people, five hours, five dollars, or five somethings. We can say that all numbers have real content; otherwise, they would not have any meaning.</p>
<p>Because quantity is contained within things themselves, and the foundation of mathematics is objective reality, and humans cannot live without objective reality, the learning of mathematics is definitely not for simple exams but is of great benefit to our real lives. Studying mathematics is for the sake of gaining more mathematical knowledge to help us live. On a small scale, such as our daily lives, if we can use mathematical knowledge to plan production and consumption, it will be much better than living a muddled, anarchic life. As the saying goes, "You won't get poor from wearing or eating, but you'll deserve to be poor if you don't know how to calculate!" This is a satire on those who cannot use arithmetic knowledge to live. On a large scale, no matter what subject you study or what matter you handle, if you have rich arithmetic knowledge, it can not only make your mind clear and organized but also have many practical benefits in your research or handling of affairs.</p>
<p>So, how to study mathematics? Here, we can briefly list a few points:</p>
<p>First, to study mathematics, it is necessary to study new social sciences and philosophy because mathematical knowledge can only be used flexibly and can only progress if you have new ideas. We often see many mathematicians who have a very rich mathematical knowledge but whose minds are mechanically dead and unable to do anything. You know, in history, no, even now, aren't there many mathematicians and natural scientists who are superstitious about God? This is clearly a contradictory expression of their scientific and mathematical knowledge. But the root of this contradiction lies in the fact that they only know how to draw X×Y or 1/3 or 2+3 and other mathematical formulas every day and don't care about anything else. As a result, they don't know anything else either, developing a rigid brain. For such mathematicians, new knowledge is certainly not easily accepted. For example, the theory of relativity is considered absurd by most mathematicians, but in fact, this theory is the most progressive. In the eyes of mathematicians with rigid brains who have no new ideas, four of course is only equal to four and nothing else, but in reality, the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan was completed in four years. The content of this four is five. But isn't this an incomprehensible statement to mechanical mathematicians?</p>
<p>Second, since mathematics is of great use to our real lives, we should pay special attention to its practicality when studying it and not study mathematics for the sake of mathematics. It is said that in 212 BC, when Roman soldiers broke through the city of Syracuse, the scientist Archimedes was still drawing and studying on the sand in a small house. When soldiers entered his house, he was still saying, "Do not destroy my circle!" This is a common example used by our quietists when "admonishing" general young students. In my opinion, the scientist's spirit of research is certainly very good, but we dare not agree with such a tendency. Because the enemy soldiers have already entered the city, the country is destroyed, and the family is ruined. Even one's own life cannot be protected. Even if his circle is successfully drawn and his research has great achievements, what use is it? Because of this, we advise friends who are learning mathematics not to just bury themselves in XY or one, two, three, four, etc. You must pay attention to national and social issues at all times, and you must always think about the practical use of your knowledge. Think about it, in the current situation in China, even if you learn mathematics well, can you use it to develop industry in China? Can you use it to save the country? I'm afraid at most you'll just end up being a comprador eating foreign food.</p>
<p>Third, to study mathematics, it is necessary to pay attention to your daily life at all times, and it is even more necessary to think deeply. When a math problem is placed before your eyes, you should spend more time thinking about it. Do not mechanically use mathematical formulas, immediately pick up a pen and start calculating, nor should you give up completely because you cannot do it for a while. I once saw a student learning mathematics encounter the following problem: A gentleman hired a nanny, stating that the monthly salary was eight yuan. Now the nanny only worked for eighteen days. How much should the salary be? For this question, he used the usual arithmetic rules, first dividing eight yuan by thirty days, trying to find the nanny's daily salary, and then multiplying the quotient by eighteen. Wouldn't the result be the nanny's salary for eighteen days? Little did he know that dividing eight by thirty can never be divided completely, which made it impossible to solve. But if you could think about it carefully, this question is very easy to answer. First, you should think that thirty days is eight yuan, then three days should be eight jiao. Then think that eighteen days is six three-day periods. So, eight multiplied by six equals forty-eight. This is the nanny's salary for eighteen days, which is forty-eight jiao, or four yuan and eight jiao. Another example is that there are six sparrows on a tree. You shoot at them, and one sparrow is hit and falls to the ground. How many sparrows are left on the tree? If you answer without thinking that there are five sparrows left on the tree, you are wrong because the five sparrows that were not hit have already flown away at the sound of the gunshot. In fact, there are no sparrows left on the tree. There are many mathematical problems like this that require careful thought, and I hope researchers will pay attention at all times.</p>
<p>Fourth, for abstract mathematical formulas, it is necessary to assume their concrete content to think about them, which makes them easier to understand.</p>
<p>Finally, of course, you have to spend more time learning. In particular, you should not be afraid of difficulties and do more exercises because this can enrich your knowledge and make your calculations proficient.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Summer at the Takahashi Seaside Bathing Beach <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— De Zhao</p>
<p>Since China produced the mermaid, the summer entertainment and sports trend has shifted to swimming</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>, and besides, there are many people who want to eat ice cream with their eyes! Therefore, every summer, the swimming pools in Shanghai are overcrowded. Not only are those who can swim shoulder to shoulder in the water, but there are also many who sit and watch from the sidelines without getting into the water. However, the capacity of small swimming pools is limited, and people get tired of seeing them after a long time. Therefore, the Takahashi Seaside Bathing Beach has become a reality in the imaginations of many people.</p>
<p>I remember before the Takahashi Seaside Bathing Beach appeared, I was attracted by an advertisement to a so-called "Ming Garden" Seaside Bathing Beach. It was an entertainment venue surrounded by factory areas near Yangshupu. The so-called seaside was just a pile of sand next to an ordinary swimming pool, with a few large umbrellas propped up, and a large-scale seascape painted on the wall of the house across the street. This kind of advertising seaside makes people laugh or cry after you get there.</p>
<p>After all, Shanghai is a place where culture and talents gather, so it is finally possible to enjoy a real seawater bath, and the name Takahashi becomes active in the eyes of a group of people who love swimming and sightseeing every summer. Speaking of Takahashi, the road is not too far; it is on the opposite bank of Wusong. But the transportation is still convenient, with special city ferry boats and public buses specially prepared for tourists. There are also artificially improved beaches and gardens, ponds, embankments, pavilions, and other arrangements, allowing tourists to rest.</p>
<p>Although the shocking waves of the sea can give people a terrifying imagination, the vastness and clarity of the sea, the endlessness, the misty water and sky, and the clear and refreshing breeze often give people a beautiful and warm feeling, making you linger and reluctant to leave. And the Takahashi Seaside is like this. There is an endless beach with miles of flat sand. Under the blue sky, white waves, and strong sunlight, there are scattered tents like Mongolian yurts. You can bring friends and sit on the sand in the tent with cool mats, looking into the distance. It is simply impossible to distinguish the continent from the sky, only vaguely seeing the sails in the distance and sparse islands. Breathing in the air is like drinking nectar. In the early morning and near dusk, when the scorching sun has no energy, you feel the cool breeze and the water is calm. At that time, you can take off your clothes and shoes and swim or walk, which will make you forget the heat and stuffiness and make you feel that there is no summer this year. At the same time, there is also a benefit on the beach, that is, the water there is active. Although you sit not far from the water, the water, activated by the tide, will be sent to your sides in bursts. Sometimes there are one or two small waves, like fountains spraying to your head, face, and body, scattering like pearls, with a posture that is both beautiful and charmingly gentle. Moreover, this method of waiting for the water is extremely suitable for people who are not good at swimming! Everyone should also pay attention: If you lack strength, it is best not to slide into the sea. Because the running water is merciless. The powerful waves and the soft sand often trap you without you realizing it!</p>
<p>The route to get there is to first go to the City Ferry Terminal on the Bund of Beijing Road (next to the famous "Floating Hotel"), where a ferry departs every hour. The round-trip ferry fee, if you take second-class seats, is six jiao and eight fen, and you can buy　　　. The ferry departs from Shanghai and breaks through the waves straight ahead in the Huangpu River. The river wind constantly blows against your clothes, making you forget the heat. If you take first-class seats, it is even more "xieyi." There are canvas chairs on the deck, and you can sit comfortably and lean back. After the blurred buildings on both sides and the clear foreign warships and merchant ships in the river gradually drift westward, you can see the green embankments of Jun Gong Road and the fields of Pudong. After passing Xidu, Donggou, Qingningsi and other places, the ferry docks at the Takahashi Ferry Terminal. There, public buses have been waiting. You can take the bus with your ticket, pass through Takahashi Town and the green fields on both sides, and arrive at the Takahashi Seaside in less than half an hour. Although the road is narrow, it is not flat, and it is winding and full of fun. After getting off the bus, you will see the gate of the Seaside Bathing Beach. After entering the gate, stepping on the stone steps, and passing the ticket office, you can see the artificially arranged garden: it is like a "吕" character shape, a large pond, with an embankment in the middle dividing it into two, and a pavilion on top. On the surrounding embankments, green trees are lush, with lush branches and leaves, thriving. It is said that the water in this pond is fresh water, and tourists can wash again with fresh water in the pond after taking a seawater bath to remove the salt. A row of elegant thatched houses, similar to old-style hall buildings, are called Thatched Halls. There is also a large dining hall, called the Seaside Dining Hall, which offers noodles, wine, and dishes. The Thatched Halls offer various cold drinks. From here to the east is the beach. To the north, countless tents are propped up, gathering hundreds of male and female tourists. On the higher ground is the building of the so-called "Seaside Hotel," where you can stay for the summer. A touch of green gauze on the doors and windows makes the tourists inside look like they are living in the clouds.</p>
<p>Places to rent swimsuits, tents, and rubber floats are available, and the cost is not very high. Healthy and beautiful people are wriggling on the beach, and the number of women is no less than that of men. A gust of sea breeze blows from the ground, and we can hear the laughter and the sound of the tide echoing in our ears.</p>
<p>There, it is indeed a moving summer picture. Scenery, people, and nature are all available!</p>

<p>This morning, the landlady asked about the situation of Company A in her conversation. I had to fabricate some things casually and managed to muddle through.</p>
<p>Thank goodness! Mr. Ji gave me good news. The letter only contained three or two simple sentences, saying, "Please come to work at the company on the 26th." I couldn't help but cry! I don't know if these are tears of gratitude or tears of sadness?</p>
<p>From tomorrow on, I really have to go to Company A to handle affairs, but I will be too busy to keep this diary. Let's wait until the next time I'm unemployed—I believe such a time will come again—to continue writing.</p>

<h3 id="e192">The Officials on the Deserted Island <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhen Jie</p>
<p>Once upon a time, in the old Russian era, there were two officials, both of whom were brainless. One day, they suddenly felt that they had been sent to a deserted island without human habitation, as if they were sitting on the magic carpet in "The Arabian Nights."</p>
<p>They had spent their entire lives in the Records Department of the Ministry of Government Affairs, where they were born, raised, and grew up. Therefore, they knew nothing about anything outside the "Ministry." All they knew was only one sentence, which was: "Respectfully presented to His Excellency So-and-So, Your Excellency, Your Servant So-and-So respectfully presents."</p>
<p>But this Ministry of Government Affairs was later abolished, and the positions of the two officials were no longer needed. They were dismissed and were idle.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Therefore, these two retired officials moved to Cheskaya Street in St. Petersburg. They each had their own families, their own cooks, and their own retirement pensions.</p>
<p>When they suddenly woke up on a deserted island without human habitation, they found themselves lying under the sky. At first, of course, they didn't understand what had happened to them. They were both surprised and asked, "Good heavens! What does this mean? Where are we?"</p>
<p>They touched and pinched each other to confirm that it was not a dream. Finally, they admitted this sad reality. They felt that in front of them was a vast ocean, behind them was only a little bit of land, and after that little bit of land was another ocean. They started crying—this cry can be said to be the first cry since their "Ministry" closed its doors. At the same time, they looked at each other and saw that neither of them was wearing much except pajamas and a medal hanging on their heads.</p>
<p>"Is it time for coffee now?" one of the officials said. He thought and cried: "What should we do now? Even if we draft a submission, what's the use!"</p>
<p>"You know, Your Excellency!" another official cheered up and said: "You go to the east, and I'll go to the west. When we all return to the original place, maybe we will find something."</p>
<p>They then set about distinguishing which direction was east and which direction was west. They remembered that once the minister had said to them: "If you want to know where the east is, then turn your face to the north, and the east will be on your right hand." But when they wanted to find out which side was north, they could only turn right, turn left, and look around in all directions. Because they had spent their entire lives in the Document Section, their efforts were all in vain.</p>
<p>"I think, Your Excellency! The best way is for you to go to the right and I'll go to the left!" one of the officials said. He had not only worked in the Document Section but also taught calligraphy at the preparatory military school, so he was a little smarter.</p>
<p>As they said, so they did. One of the officials walked to the right. He came across many trees full of various fruits. He really wanted to pick an apple, but they were all hanging high on the branches, forcing him to climb up. He climbed around and failed. All he could do was tear his pajamas. Walking to a stream, he saw countless fish swimming in the deep water. Entering the forest, he saw many crows and wild rabbits, etc. He drooled. "Good heavens, there are so many things to eat!" he shouted, and the fire of hunger burned even more. But he finally returned to the agreed place empty-handed.</p>
<p>"How is it, Your Excellency? Did you find anything?"</p>
<p>"No, just an old Moscow newspaper!"</p>
<p>The two officials lay down again, but their empty stomachs did not allow them to rest. Half of their sleepy eyes were seeing those people who were enjoying a happy life on their pensions; the other half were disturbed by the fresh fruits, fish, birds, and wild rabbits they had seen during the day, making them unable to settle down.</p>
<p>"The things that humans eat, their original forms are flying in the sky, swimming in the water, and growing on trees. Who would have thought of that? Your Excellency!"</p>
<p>"That's right!" another official continued: "I must also admit; I always thought that the bread and butter we eat for breakfast were born into the world just like they are on the plates on the table."</p>
<p>"According to this reasoning, then, if we want to eat a pheasant, we must catch it, kill it, pluck its feathers, and roast it, but how do we start? The two said in unison.</p>
<p>They fell silent and tried to fall asleep again, but hunger always drove sleep away.</p>
<p>"I believe I can eat my own boots right now!" one of the officials said again, cheering up.</p>
<p>"Leather gloves aren't bad either, especially if they've been softened!" another official said.</p>
<p>The two officials glared at each other intently. Their eyes radiated like flames; their teeth were chattering. A turbid moan came from their chests. They slowly approached, suddenly becoming like terrible madmen. They shouted, roared, and burned with anger. The official who had been a calligraphy teacher pounced on him and bit off his colleague's badge, swallowing it into his stomach. It was not until his teeth saw blood that their consciousness returned.</p>
<p>"God save us!" they shouted at the same time: "We must not eat each other!"</p>
<p>They were silent again for a while.</p>
<p>"In any case, we must say something to pass the time. Otherwise, murder and death will happen!" one of the officials said.</p>
<p>"Can you explain why the sun rises first and then sets? Why not reverse it?"</p>
<p>"Aren't you a funny person? You get up first! Your Excellency! Then you go to the department to work, um um... then you have to eat dinner!" He stared and dared not go on.</p>
<p>"But why doesn't man reverse it? You can sleep first, see the things in your dreams, and then get up!"</p>
<p>"Ah, that's right. But when I was an official, I always thought: now it's dawn, then it will soon be day, um um... then it will be dinner!" He blurted it out again. But saying the word "dinner" reminded them of their experiences during the day, and the two officials became sad. They were silent for a while again.</p>
<p>"A doctor told me that a person can support himself with his own spirit for a long time," one of the officials began again.</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"It's very simple. You know, a person's own essence and blood produce other essence and blood, and the other circulates and produces another kind of essence and blood. This goes on until all the essence and blood are gone."</p>
<p>"What happens after that?"</p>
<p>"After that, you have to put something to eat in your stomach!"</p>
<p>"This devil!" the other official cried.</p>
<p>No matter what issue they talked about, the result invariably turned to "eating." This only made their appetite even stronger. Therefore, they decided not to talk about anything. They thought of the old Moscow newspaper that they had picked up, and the other official began to read:</p>
<p>"A Record of the Grand Feast of the Governor! Delicious delicacies from land and sea!"</p>
<p>"Devil! Please don't read any more!" the other official cried out with a desperate expression. He snatched the newspaper from his colleague and began to find something else to read:</p>
<p>"Our correspondent from Tula writes that yesterday, a sturgeon was obtained near the Upa River, which is rare in the local area, so a banquet was held to celebrate it. The main course was placed in a large wooden basin, decorated with pickled melons and fruits, and a sprig of parsley was inserted into the fish's mouth. Each guest received a piece. The cooking was exceptionally exquisite!..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Your Excellency! I don't think you are good at choosing reading material either?" So the official who interrupted the conversation snatched the newspaper again and read:</p>
<p>"A certain old resident of Vitek has recently invented a novel recipe for making fish soup..."</p>
<p>The heads of the two officials drooped. No matter where their eyes looked, it was something related to eating. Their thoughts were also destined to think about eating. No matter how hard they tried not to think about steaks or the like, everything was in vain. Their fantasies were invariably without room for resistance and would return to the things they painfully wailed about. Finally, one of the officials had an inspiration:</p>
<p>"I've thought of a way!" he cried happily. "Your Excellency! What do you think? We can go find a farmer!"</p>
<p>"Ah, a farmer, but how can we catch one?"</p>
<p>"There must be one here, because this thing is everywhere."</p>
<p>So they walked around on the deserted island for a long time, and finally they found a farmer sleeping under a tree.</p>
<p>"What? Sleeping here? You lazybones!" they scolded the farmer angrily: "Two officials are about to starve to death, and you don't care? Get up! Go! Go to work!"</p>
<p>The farmer got up and saw these two angry gentlemen standing in front of him. At first, he wanted to escape. But the two officials suddenly caught him, and he had to submit to his fate. He had to obey the two officials and go to work for them.</p>
<p>He first climbed up the tree and picked dozens of good apples for the two officials, leaving a bad one for himself. Later, he used a wooden drill to make fire, and he plucked his own hair to make a net to catch some crows and rabbits. He used his fire to roast these delicious wild game, allowing the two officials to eat comfortably and relieve their hunger.</p>
<p>The two officials were very happy to see that the farmer was able to work hard. They had already forgotten how close they were to starving to death yesterday! They were only thinking about how to be an official who could rule and drive this farmer.</p>

<p>— Dongyuan</p>
<p>There was a French actress named Madame Solaire. In 1933, she was already seventy years old, but thanks to the art of makeup, when she appeared on stage, she still looked beautiful and was admired by all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the wrinkles on this beautiful actress's face had recently become too obvious, and even the most skillful makeup could not hide them. Therefore, she was filled with sorrow, feeling that her youth had passed! But she was not discouraged and still wanted to use the power of science to restore her youth. She found a famous doctor, Dr. Asterley, and paid him 10,000 gold francs to remove her wrinkles. As a result, thanks to the doctor's excellent surgery, the wrinkles on the old actress's face were indeed removed, but she did not fulfill the contract and refused to pay the doctor the 10,000 gold francs for the surgery. The doctor was not satisfied and eventually filed a lawsuit in court.</p>
<p>When this news spread, the general Parisian public was very surprised. When the trial began, many people went to listen in. The defendant, Madame Solaire, also appeared in court in person. When the judge asked her why she had violated the contract, she immediately argued: "Although the wrinkles around my eyes disappeared as a result of the doctor's surgery, my eyes have become like fish eyes. Not only can I not look around freely, but I cannot even close them. Should I still pay the surgery fee?" But the doctor said: "The contract was for me to remove your wrinkles. Now that the wrinkles have been removed, no matter what, the contract should be fulfilled." What was the result? The doctor's lawsuit was ultimately dismissed.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Unstable British Diplomacy <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Diqiu</p>
<p>In the recent Montreux Conference, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu bluntly accused the British delegation: "You advocate one policy in Geneva and another here. You are trying your best to undermine mutual assistance and regional agreements!" This is a ruthless yet appropriate criticism of Britain's recent diplomatic attitude. In fact, because the British Empire has the most territories and the largest sphere of influence, it has conflicts with all countries in the world, large or small. And because the British Empire is in decline and everything tends to be conservative, it has failed to adopt a resolute foreign policy towards other countries. As a result, London's diplomatic activities have become unstable.</p>
<p>Not to mention distant events, let's just look at recent facts. For example, when London suddenly felt that Hitler's actions posed a danger to it, British imperialism immediately united with France and Italy to form the Stresa Front against Germany. But just as this front was forming, it felt that it should not help France to contain Germany, so it turned around and negotiated with Berlin, concluding the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Regarding Italy, in the past, Britain wanted to maintain friendly relations with it, but unfortunately, Mussolini wanted to monopolize Abyssinia, threatening British rights in Africa and the Mediterranean, making it unable to adopt a positive attitude towards Italy for a time. As a result, London's diplomats became busy, constantly shuttling between Paris, Geneva, and London, resolutely advocating sanctions against Italy. At the same time, the Far East fleet was also transferred to the Mediterranean, and it even threatened to close the Suez Canal. For a time, commentators said that Britain had adopted a positive attitude. However, after the Italian army achieved a temporary victory in its invasion of Abyssinia, the old British imperialism, seeing that the source of the Nile River was not being affected, and also feeling that Mussolini was arrogant and invincible, had no choice but to disregard its reputation and voluntarily proposed the lifting of sanctions against Italy in Geneva and began to transfer the Mediterranean fleet back to its original defenses in order to appease Mussolini. At the Montreux Conference, when the Soviet Union requested that the Black Sea Fleet be allowed to freely enter the Mediterranean and advocated the wartime blockade of the Black Sea, it was generally believed that this was to prevent the development of German and Italian aggression, and Britain would likely agree. However, London's diplomats felt that this would threaten British power in the Mediterranean, so they desperately opposed the Soviet Union's proposal, leading to the Romanian Foreign Minister's rebuke. These facts have all occurred recently, and therefore they can all prove that even now British diplomacy is still continuing to waver.</p>
<p>Such British diplomacy is of course very welcome in Italy and Germany. Hitler, under London's hesitant attitude and secret encouragement, rearmed, tearing up the Versailles and Locarno Treaties. Italy's invasion of Abyssinia was opposed by Britain, but it was also British imperialism that first recognized the results of this invasion. Now, Italy and Germany have formed a common front, which is the establishment of the German-Austrian rapprochement agreement.</p>
<p>According to the Berlin and Vienna communiqués, the terms of the German-Austrian agreement are:</p>
<p>(1) Germany recognizes Austria's full sovereignty;</p>
<p>(2) Each country agrees not to directly or indirectly interfere in the other's internal political development, including the issue of Austrian National Socialism;</p>
<p>(3) Austria intends to maintain a special policy towards Germany in accordance with the basic principles of Austria's recognition of itself as a German state, so as not to disturb the Roman Protocol of 1934 and the Additional Articles of 1936, and the status of Italy, Austria, and Hungary as parties to this document.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Austrian cabinet has been reorganized, with the famous pro-German element, Hossbach, appointed as a Minister without Portfolio, and Schmidt as Foreign Minister. In this way, the long-standing dispute that had not been improved between Germany and Austria has now become friendly. This friendship has further promoted the combination of Germany and Italy, forming a Central European bloc centered on Germany and Italy and including Poland and Austria-Hungary. Because Poland has always followed Berlin, and Austria-Hungary has long been under Rome's control, and Germany's main conflict in the past was the Austrian issue, now that German-Austrian relations have improved, Germany and Italy can of course immediately combine, and thus Poland and Austria-Hungary will inevitably become more subordinate to these two major aggressor countries, forming a Central European aggression bloc. When the German-Austrian rapprochement agreement was announced, from Rome to Warsaw, they were all expressing rejoicing. Regarding the meeting of the signatories of the Locarno Treaty and the East African issue, Hitler and Mussolini both expressed the same attitude in unison. All of this can be said to be the spiritual manifestation of the formation of the Central European bloc.</p>
<p>Naturally, we cannot say that this Central European aggression bloc was entirely promoted by unstable British diplomacy, but in recent years, the reckless actions of Germany and Italy, regardless of everything, are also closely related to the wavering London diplomacy. We can say that if Britain could resolutely fulfill its obligations under international treaties, world peace would at least not be threatened as much as it is now, and the reckless actions of Germany and Italy would at least have some reservations.</p>
<p>Now that Europe's two major dangerous countries have combined, and Poland and Austria-Hungary are even more attached to them, their adventurous behavior will of course be even more severe in the future, and the guarantee of peace in Europe and even the world will of course be more problematic. In this situation, the first to be threatened are France, the Soviet Union, and the Little Entente, which of course have no direct relationship with the British Empire and do not require it to worry. Moreover, to be honest, London's diplomats are actually very happy to see the emergence of the German-Italian bloc to stand against the French-Soviet bloc, because once this situation is created, Britain can sit in the middle and benefit from the struggle. Therefore, British public opinion expressed "relief" after the German-Austrian agreement was announced. However, if Germany, following the resolution of the Austrian issue, suddenly very practically raises the issue of recovering pre-war colonies, then the German colonies formerly administered by Britain in Africa, Australia, and other places would be in immediate danger of being taken back. At that time, Britain would probably have to adopt a positive attitude to maintain the status quo. And if Italy, with the help of Germany, continues to expand its power in Africa and the Mediterranean, then London would probably have to raise the slogan of sanctions again. But when the unfortunate events for Britain really come again, the so-called temporary positive attitude will really not be of much use. When the Italian-Abyssinian War had already broken out and the situation in the Far East was even more serious, what effect did the temporary positive attitude adopted by Britain have? If Britain wants to truly obtain temporary security, it should prepare to cooperate with France and the Soviet Union to use the power of the group to stop all aggressive and adventurous actions. According to reports, Soviet figures recently criticized Britain, saying, "Those who advocate maintaining the European status quo must unite with each other at this moment to resist Germany's policy of external development. And for the sake of British interests, it is also advisable to join this group, otherwise the matter of surrender will be staged again and again, and Hitler, the leader of Germany, will advance even more recklessly and unscrupulously! Moreover, the agreement between Germany and Austria is actually the natural result of Germany's unilateral abolition of the Locarno Treaty and the restoration of armed forces in the Rhineland region. According to this, the country has the possibility of invading Central Europe in order to form a strong group to isolate Eastern Europe from Western Europe." We believe that such remarks are worthy of consideration by London's diplomats.</p>
<p>However, judging from the current situation, Britain under the Conservative Party cabinet will probably not adopt a positive attitude to maintain the status quo. It will continue its wavering diplomatic policy: today it will use France to contain Germany and Italy, and tomorrow it will support Germany and Italy to resist the French-Soviet bloc, on the one hand making friends with all countries, and on the other hand contradicting all countries. In this way, aggressors are allowed to advance boldly under Britain's moderation and cover, so as to disrupt peace, and at the same time, it will turn around and endanger Britain.</p>
<p>Today's Europe, Britain is in a pivotal position between two major hostile blocs, namely the French-Soviet bloc and the German-Italian bloc. If it can combine with France and the Soviet Union, then Germany and Italy's outward development will naturally be strongly hindered. Conversely, if it participates in or even leads the German-Italian bloc to confront France and the Soviet Union, then European peace will immediately become a problem. But Britain does not adopt a resolute attitude. It hopes that others will engage in war, especially that this war will move to Eastern Europe and erupt in Ukraine, so that it can benefit from it without any loss. However, the development of events is not necessarily in line with London's thinking. Not to mention other things, if the conflict between the French-Soviet and German-Italian blocs develops to the point of armed conflict, or if German-Italian forces have a direct conflict with Britain in the Balkans, in the Mediterranean, or in Africa, then its intermediate position in the European situation and its unstable diplomatic policy will necessarily be automatically canceled.</p>

<p>— Mengfei</p>
<p>The "Historical Records: Wu Family" records: "When Zixu was about to die, he said: 'Gouge out my eyes and place them on the east gate of Wu, to watch the Yue destroy Wu.'" His gnashing of teeth and festering heart were like this. I cannot help but feel sad for today's quasi-slaves of a ruined nation.</p>
<p>Wang Ruoxu said: "There are three mistakes in interpreting the Analects: being too profound, being too lofty, and being too generous. The words of the sages are also human emotions." For those who blindly believe in the classics, this is a wake-up call!</p>
<p>"If one has not been heard of at forty or fifty, then one is not to be feared." "If one is hated at forty, then one's end is near." People do have those who change their principles late in life, but generally speaking, one can also see that their ends are different.</p>
<p>"Learning then not firm." "Firm" should be interpreted as "obscured." If interpreted as "strong," then there is a difference as vast as between a hair and a thousand miles.</p>
<p>The relationship between father and son is different now and in the past. In the past, Confucius said: "Not changing the way of one's father for three years, one can be said to be filial!" In fact, what can be changed need not wait three years, and what cannot be changed cannot be changed even for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Lu Yushu's poem says: "Learning is like Yuan Kai, becoming an addiction, writing is like Xiangru, resembling a wanderer, standing alone at Confucius's door, nothing to do, losing to Yanzi, his mind is dedicated." This praises Yanzi's joy in his humble alley.</p>
<p>Fan Chunfu said: "The gentleman studies his inner self, the petty man pursues his outer self. What the gentleman governs is the root, what the petty man governs is the branches." This is the watershed between gentlemen and petty men.</p>
<p>Emperor Xizong of Tang blamed the concubines of Huang Chao for following the rebels. One replied: "The state, with a million troops, lost its ancestral temples and fled to Bazhong. Now you blame a woman for not being able to resist the rebels. Where do you place the dukes, ministers, generals, and commanders?" Reading these words, thinking of the treason of Yin Rugeng and others, I cannot help but feel sad for a long time.</p>
