<p>第二綜覈名實　總覈名家、可以矯正虛僞敷衍、遲緩、之積弊、其主要節目、爲下列各點、（甲）明系統、必須確定上下縱橫之明晰的系統、使辦事有一定的準則、考騐有一定的程序、而後責任分明、無可諉卸、（乙）公銓選、要選擇適當的人才、使能稱職盡職、不但甄用之際、應絕對無偏無私、而且應以實際事功與能力爲重、勿專拘泥於資格、（丙）專責成、旣擇定任用以後、就要假以事權、使得盡量展布、還須遇事指導、俾有成就、（丁）行久任、上官篤於信任、所屬人員乃能發揮長處、奮能圖功所以旣任之後、如人事相當、卽不宜更調太頻、務使久於所任、（戊）嚴考核、對所任工作、必須考核周詳勿使遺漏、（己）一賞罰、信賞必罰、均須本於一定的標準、不可厚彼薄此、略有歧異、（庚）稽查報吿、對於屬員所呈送之報吿、必須實事求是、加以考查按騐明定功過、隨時考成、（辛）面獎廉能、對於屬員之廉明有爲者、並須面加獎許、激發其向上之心、以收貫澈始終之效、</p>
<p>第三密切連繫　我們行政上一切工作、最忌散漫分歧、各息為政、如此不僅力量分散、而且往往妨礙其他部分的工作、不能收整個之成效、以事項而言、無論民政、敎育、建設、治安、各項、均屬一體相關、休戚與共、今後必須本恊同一致的精神、更進一步的達到密切的連繫、以地域而言、鄰接地區、尤屬痛癢相關、更應密切合作、所以各行政督察專員、對於鄰區或鄰省之專員、應切實連絡、各種政治工作之與鄰區或鄰省有關者、務必化除界限、不分畛域、通力合作、一致進行、省與省間亦應如此、至各省各區之間、更應互相參觀、互相師法聽到某項工作在某省某區辦得最有成效時、各廳長專員卽應親往參觀考察硏究、如此互相觀摩、共同改進、必能收到很大的效果、不但對隣省隣區應如此、而且就工作上可能的狀况下、還可以到國外實地考察、以增進己的智識、及辦事經騐、總之爲增進行效能計、相互連繫與避免重複衝突均屬必要、近來常聽到下級機關、以命令系統複雜不統一爲言、其實此不僅爲法規制度上之關係、法規制度固宜隨時改進、而人事方面對於辦理公文者、若能善爲訓練、使其理解淸晰周到、辦事手續不致錯誤、主管人員更能嚴密注意顧到機關的職權與相互關係、卽不至有重複凌亂之弊、更須以合作精神、貫澈其間、則歧異衝突之弊，自不致發生、</p>
<p>第四政治與敎育打成一片　我們現在無論舉辦何事、每感到人力不敷、補救之道、第一要留意人才、第二要轉移風氣、所以無論省縣各區行政長官、必須使所在地之大中小學校敎職員、與行政機關人員打成一片、不僅可就地取才、恊助政治之推動、卽於改革社會、振作人心、確立風氣、亦必以政敎合作爲樞紐、　現代政治日趨於專門化、與技術化、僅憑常識、决不够應付、必須利用專家、資以爲助、各省雖因經費關係、不能聘用多數專門技術人才、但各地之大學敎授等、必多富有研究之專家、卽中等學校敎師中、如詳爲物色、亦不乏專門人才、各省府關於行政事項、卽可利用此等敎授之專門知識、請其研究規劃、一方面在政府可收專家相助之效、同時學校敎授等亦可以實際問題、與其平時所學相證騐當無不樂於貢獻之理、中國古時本以留心人才、爲地方官最要之職務、我們對當地敎育界人士、不僅應切實連絡、留心考察其學識品格與才能、以相助爲理、而且對於品格高尙之敎育界人士、必須優禮有加、養成學生與社會等師崇道之風氣、各地敎育廳長、一方面應敦崇品格、自覺其居一省師表之地位、同時對於養成師資、更須以品格高尙、與任事熱心為重尤須多方設法、激勵敎育界、爲國家社會服務犧牲之精神、如此我們必能收到轉移風氣推動政治之效果、而對於公民訓練與學生訓練、亦應注重於此、（未完）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>奧國內閣改組與中歐政局</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>奧大利內閣於十三日深夜經過十小時的會議後已於十四日完全改組了休樞尼格仍任總理並兼外交與國防兩部大權獨攬儼然成爲奧國之事實上與名義上的獨裁者而先前之事實上的獨裁者內衛團領袖斯帶倫堡親王却被按於政治舞毫之外奧國這次內閣的改組不但在內政上有重大的意義而且對於今後中歐政局的發展也有很大的影響</p>
<p>我們知道奧國自從大戰以後因國力的萍弱其存在與獨立全賴於英法等國的維護國際聯盟日會借以巨欵改造奧國的財政組織但自世界經濟恐慌爆發後英法　無餘力帮助奧國於是意大利法西斯的勞力就乘機侵入奧國了一九三三年德國國社黨上臺後急謀合併奧國引起奧人的極大反感因此親意的傾向更加濃厚起來從陶爾斐斯到休樞尼格內閣都可說是在意大利法西斯勢力卵翼下的政府一切內政外交的設施都唯羅馬的命令是從例如法西斯的利益是同國社黨的德奧合併主張衝突的於是奧政府就極力壓迫國內的國社黨又因黑衫首相是反對社會黨的於是奧政府就極力摧殘國內的左傾勢力陶爾斐斯厲行這種政策的結果就引起一九三四年二月社會黨的革命與六月國社黨的政變陶氏在政變中被殺殞命繼陶爾斐斯而成立的休樞尼格內閣也仍然是繼續著前政府的親意政策的</p>
<p>在奧國親意的勢力中最重要的人物就是內衛團的領袖斯帶倫堡親王內衛團是奧國法西斯蒂的武裝組織武器多由意大利供給勢力非常之大奧政府之所以能够壓服反對派的國社黨與社會黨大部就是靠着內衛團的力量因此它的領袖斯帶倫堡也就成了奧國政治上的事實上之獨裁者不過正因爲內衛團的勢力太大了行動太跋扈了於是就引起嚴重的反對休樞尼格所屬的天主敎社會黨雖然也反對德奧的合併與左傾勢力的抬頭但却不願意奧國政洽全受羅馬的支配所以對於極端親意派的斯帶倫堡是非常反對的到了最近兩方的衝突形勢更形尖化上星期日天主敎勞工團作春季遊行時就有內衛團團員數百人對之辱駡以後斯帶倫堡又擅以「爲法西斯主義而奮鬭的奧國人民」之名義致電莫索里尼賀其吞併阿國的成功內衛團這種種行動都是大部的奧國人民所不能贊成的因此休樞尼格就乘意國在東非戰爭後原氣未復無暇外顧時改組內閣排擠斯帶倫堡於政府之外了現在新閣中雖然仍有內衛團團員三人但其親意的力量已非昔日可比了</p>
<p>總上所述可知　次奧國內閣的改組在對內方面說是天主敎社會黨的勢力戰勝了內衛團的跋扈使以後奧國的政治不至於過分的依賴意國而就國際方面說則因內衛團的失勢意大利在中歐的勢力將大受打擊不過奧國現在仍是個不能完全獨立的國家所以此後帝國主義勢力在中歐的衝突恐將因此次事件而更加緊了</p>

<p>關於營養問題俗語說「百病由口入」這句話眞不錯。從前很著名的醫學家Sir　williamosller也講過，一個人得病，除由直接傳染外，十九都歸罪於吃的東西，所以有人講，完善的飲食與　良的食品，其重要不亞於卻病的醫藥。我們吃的食物，種類很多，但是主要的化學原料不外下列五種：　糖類，　脂肪；　蛋白質；　無機鹽；　維生素。人的身體，好像一部機器，糖類和脂肪就是燃料，能够直接發生動能，無機鹽和蛋白質可以算是身體裏面的修補和建築的材料，維生素好像機器的滑油，沒有了牠，機器就開不動的。在這幾種營養材料裏面，糖類和脂肪的化學作用，比較簡單，蛋白質同維生素的化學作用，比較複雜，幾十年前的化學家，以爲各種蛋白質的營養價值，都是一樣，但是現在我們知道道是不對的，因爲蛋白質是二十種氨基酸所組成，蛋白質不一定個個都有道二十種氨基酸。像牛乳裏面的酪素和鷄蛋裏的蛋白，因爲他們對於人體所需要的氨基酸都已齊備，能够使動物單獨生存循規生長，所以像這兩種的蛋白質，就叫做完全蛋白質，其餘的蛋白質所含的氨基酸多少不等，有的能使動物單獨生存，不能循規生長，就叫做半完全蛋白質，像麥裏面的麥膠腈（Glia　in）是。有的蛋白質旣不能使動物單獨生存，又不能循規生長，就叫做不完全蛋白質，像玉米裹面的玉黍腈（Zein）是。完全的蛋白質很少，不過我們可以利用化學的方法來支配。譬如麥麵是很富於糖類和蛋白質，但是缺乏脂肪，所以西人把麵包同牛奶同吃，這種支配方法，是很合於科學的原理。我國北方人往往拿麥麫和黃豆同吃，這也是合於科學的原理，因爲麥裏面的蛋白質缺乏好幾種氨基酸，單獨吃來是不很好，但這些缺少的氨基酸，黃豆裏面很豐富，同時黃豆裏面所缺的氨基酸，麥裏面都有。普通黃豆麫包是用　份麥麫和一份黃豆做成的，這一種麫包的成分同歐戰時法國的軍用麫包的成分一樣。據調查所得，山東有幾個學校很提倡學生吃黃豆饅頭，結果墨生的身體都長的很好。這可以證明黃豆和麥同麫吃是很合於科學的原理，在我們中國是值得提倡的。講到維生素這個名詞，大家想都　經聽得很熟。維生素的發明，不過是最近　三十年的事。當初化學家把人造的純粹食料和成分一樣的天然食料來飼養動物，結果吃純粹食料的動物，遠不如吃天然食料的長的好，於是便發明了維生素。現在所知道的已經有很事種，不過我們現在對於A．B．C．D．E．五種的維生素比較明瞭些。在食物中維生素的含量雖然很少，但是他們對於營養的影響，却是非常之大。譬如我們所吃的食物，假使缺乏維生素A就要發眼乾病，缺乏維生素B．就要發生脚氣病，缺乏維生素C．就要發生壞血病，缺乏維生素D．就會使小孩的骨骼發育不良而生軟骨病，缺乏維生素E．就不能生育或所生子女必致天折。食物中所含維生秦的種類很不一致，有的富於這　種而缺乏那一種的。所含維生素很豐富而各種都比較完全的食品要算是牛奶了。我國不是吃牛奶的國家，但是我們所吃的其他東西如鷄蛋，蔬菜，水果等，裹面都有很豐富的維生素，我們只要分配得宜，就不怕發生毛病。丁文江先生以前曾經講過，在歐戰時我國參戰的工人，挖戰壕的能力與西洋人相等，道是因爲吃的東西與西洋人一樣。但在國內的工人工作的效率，就比較外人低得多，因爲國內工人所吃的東西，營養太不够了。我以爲　是十兵作戰能力不如人家，一般學生體格不如人家，也都是因爲營養不够的緣故。所以營養是一個非常重要的問題，我們應該趕緊研究我們平常食品的營養價值，然後從研究的結果，想出很經濟的方法，使　人可以得到很充分的營養。我國從事這都食物研究的地方，過去有北平協和醫學院，山東齊魯大學。最近有北平燕京大學，北平大學農學院，南京金陵大學，南京科學社生物研究所，上海大同大學等，我們很希望大家努力提侶這種研究，將來我國的膳食問題才有改良希望。</p>
<p>關於染料間題　前面已經請過，染料對於衣的問題，是非常重要，就是在窮鄕僻壤的人，都要用到染料，可見染料用途是非常普遍的，但是染料究竟是怎樣來的，要答覆這個問題，我們就不能不談到煤了。</p>
<p>煤炭除了用作燃料而外，其他的重要用途，普通人都不很注意，其實煤的用途實在太多，如炸藥，藥材，防腐劑，香料，照相材料，人造電木，染料以及一切有機藥品，都是從這裹來的。以前製煤氣和煉焦的人，都覺得工廠裏所殘留下來的黑東西，不僅沒有用，並且覺得非常討厭，常常把牠隨便丟掉。這種無謂的消耗，差不多經過了一百多年沒有人理會，眞是可惜。從前的人都相信有機化合物裏面都含有生命力，不是人類所能製造的，現在我們不特能够製造，而且人造的東西，牠的品質往往比天然的還要純粹，有的比玫瑰還要香，有的比蜂蜜還要甜，有的比虹霓還要美麗，還有許多人造的成品爲天然所沒有的。</p>
<p>煤炭經過燃燒以後，所殘留下來的只是灰燼，假使把煤炭放在器具裏面，不和空氣接觸，同時在下面加熱蒸溜，那來煤炭所含的揮發物就向外逃走，剩下來的炭和灰的混合物，就是焦炭。外逃的氣體遇冷後，一部分凝成黑油，就是煤膏，其餘的氣體洗去氮後，就是煤氣。爲明瞭起見，我們現在把一噸烟煤蒸溜　所得的各種產品，列於下表：</p>
<p>煤膏蒸溜後就可得到十餘種染料基本產物，由這十餘種基本產物即可得幾白種的中間產物，便可製成千餘柿的染料。第一種的人造染料是在一八五六年英國人Perkin所發明的，他在十五歲的時候，就追踵德國化學大家Hoffmann學習化學，那個時候正好Hoffmann在英國講學，Perkin因受了Hoflmann的影響，便想從煤膏製造金鷄納，他將煤膏裏蒸出來的苯胺（安尼林）　化，結果所得到的東西，不是純潔的化合物而是一種黑色的沉澱。普通人遇到這種情形，必定以爲沒有甚麼用處，就會隨便丟掉，但是Perkin經過詳細研究之後，便發明了第一種煤膏染料，這就是現在的安尼林紫（Aniline　Purple一八六七年德國化學家Graebe同Liebermann發明人造茜草色精（Alizarin），在他們未發明這種染料以前，法國有九萬英畝的地皮種植茜草，提取草裏面的茜素，作爲紅色染料。一八六九年Gracbe－Liebermann和Perkin先後得了製造茜草色精特許狀。於是天然的茜草就沒有人再種植了。第三種主要染料的發明的二溴靛（Dibfomo　Inligo）。從　西方各國都崇尙紫色，因爲道種顏色非常罕貴，所以只有富貴的人，才有資格穿紫的，我國有句俗話「取靑紫如拾芥」，紫的顏色，在中國古時，也是代表貴官的意思。這種顏料，從前都由地中海中一種紫螺分秘物製成，一兩差不多要賣到三百多美金，後來在一九〇九年德國化學家Friedlander把這顏料拿來分析，方才明白了牠的構造，以後就用人工製造了。第四種重要染料的發明是靛藍（Indigo）。靛藍的應用起源很早，古時埃及就有人用靑布來裹屍，因爲這種靑布是很久不會變色的。這種染料從前都是從植物得來，印度所種這種植物最多，在一八九七年全印度種靛藍的田有一百萬畝，產量有八千噸，價值二千萬美金。但從Baeyer費十四年的心血，發叫了人造靛藍以後，天然靛藍的產量，就大大的减少。在一九一四年全印度所產的僅值二十萬金。人造靛藍的公司，最初以德國Badiche公司爲最大，這個公司曾經花了五百萬的金錢，十七年的化學研究，才能够握有全世界靛藍染料的牛耳。他的出品差不多佔全球百分之九十六，但是到了歐戰以後，其他各國同他努力競爭，所以現在德國在染料市塲上不能像從前那樣壟斷。這裏所說的幾種基本染料，都是從煤膏裏得來的。上面議過，從煤膏裏面我們可以製造成千的染料，現在所舉的，不過其中的幾個例子罷了。這些染料都是屬於苯胺染料。這類的染料顏色旣多，色澤又很耐久，而且對於絲棉等織品的染色，都能合用</p>

<h3>宋哲元　暢談冀察局勢　十五日由津返平</h3>
<p>北平通訊、冀察政務委員會委員長宋哲元、自四月一日離平赴津、迄今已一月有半、茲以政務待理、特於十五日下午四時四十分專車返平、張自忠戈定遠二人同來、保安隊均便服在站戒備、甚爲嚴密、宋出站後、卽與富占魁·劉驥·同車返武衣庫私腐、五時半接見新聞界、發表談話如次、</p>
<p>關於冀東問題</p>
<p>「余到津後、以嗓病致滯留多日、社會上因頗多推測、故急趕回與大家一見以釋羣疑、余在津晤永見、未談政治問題、晤松室、僅由松室申明彼係負交涉責任者、與多田會見、曾交換中日兩國關係及解决冀東問題之意見、對冀東問題、多田曾表示可以解决、撤銷該項組織、不過遲早問題耳、本人對任何問題、向係一談再談、最多至三談、如仍不能解决、惟有聽其自然、當土肥原在平接洽此問題時、曾謂兩個月卽可解决、然至今亦未實現、縱談亦與事無補、此事在表面覜之、乃地方局部問題、實則於中日兩國關係重大、地方問題、又其决也、多田·松室·均係主張取銷冀東組織之人、但日關東軍有數人反對、因此不能解决、其原則以權限未分淸之故也、現此事究由日駐屯軍·抑日關東軍·負責接洽、尙屬疑問、擬俟日駐屯軍新任司令田代到任後、與之談商、俾確定負責人、然後進行交涉、</p>
<p>防止走私問題</p>
<p>華北走私問題、非僅冀察兩省、卽山東以及華南各地、亦皆有之、此非始於今日、大約已歷三四年未決、惟近來走私、較前猖獗、走私問題不能防止、在吾國損失至鉅、四月份卽减少收入一百四十萬元、在日方大商人、亦受損失、余在津時、曾晤津海關稅務司、彼希望本人恊助緝私、本人當答以此乃打官話、吾人應說眞話、余對防止走私意旨、　須中日兩國政府有辦法、按正規進行、方可有效、如私貨運送時、有兵艦在後護送，此卽不合正規、當然無法查緝、　爲稅則問題、商人均係惟利是圖、如其貨物本爲百五十元、上稅須二百元、合本共變爲三百五十元、售出則僅能得二百二十元、自然不免他圖、現聞財部對稅則或將加以修改、　權限應統一、無論警察或緝私隊等、縱恊助海關、亦僅及於皮毛、如有一統一命令、責成專人負責、則一切自較便利、如此三問題解决、同時將海關行政權、收歸國人掌管、則走私防止可期、</p>
<p>日軍强化問題</p>
<p>日駐屯軍增加人數問題、並未通知我方、查條的規定、日軍祇能駐八百人、二十二年時、日軍曾增至五千人、當時政府之力、尙在此間、兵力亦厚、尙不予以干涉、至今實無良策、人民對政府、惟有完糧納稅、服從命令、而希望政府者、亦祇在保護地方、解决痛苦、吾國人之通病、皆責人而不責己、故本人主張應研究人民所需、與社會所需、努力爲之、方可以救國家、</p>
<p>德王獨立問題</p>
<p>德王獨立之說、傳之甚久、彼不獨受牽制、且受壓迫、縱有其他、亦環境壓迫所致、其心决不致有二、如姜維然、非其環境不能勝諸葛亮、何能降漢、且中華民國亦無對不起德王之處」云云、</p>
<p>保全領土問題</p>
<p>最後有人詢宋對保全冀察領土意見、宋謂此事暫不敢言、蓋目前主戰主和者均有、主戰者固出於愛國熱誠、主和者亦有其看法、並非不出於愛國之心、惟主其事者、則須由一人以命令行之、如周瑜之戰曹操然、本人對和對戰、均不能有所主張、此卽示其爲軍人、一切服從命令之意也、談到防共問題、宋謂余以爲無論任何黨派、祇要言行一致、皆可成功、共產黨卽係言是而行非、爲民之所惡、而非民之所欲、故余素反對之、余擬在平稍事休息、卽行出巡、（十五日）</p>

<p>該市縱的六英里、橫的五英里、街道多不甚直　英國習重保守、一經建造、即不多作更張也、有運河直通曼遮斯德、長約五十公里、所有運河內河（有麥爾西河）海道等航錢、及鐵道公路等、均滙集於市之西南部、聯運極便、市内公園甚多、其最大者稱舍夫教公園、長約一英里、廣約半英里、有動物園及熱帶植物溫室、（南洋羣島之椰樹檳榔、我國之茶花菊花竹等均備）、珍禽異獸、琪花瑤草、萃於一方、入夏游人衆多、絡繹於途、有如我國之靈隱進香、海寗觀潮、殊鉅觀也、</p>
<p>記者乘春假之暇、曾來游一次、茲特記述該市華僑狀况如下、諒亦關心僑政者之所樂聞也、</p>
<p>華僑在利物浦曁附近蘭開夏·謙謝·與威爾期等城市、從前在民五六年間約有四五千人之譜、（其時領事館尙未成立）麕集丕地街（Pitt．Street）一帶、歐戰後英兵回籍失業者多、排擠華僑、無所不用其極、業務橫受干涉、返國者不能再來、新來者多方留難、囚之於最近三年內、（二二年至二五年）僅剩四百餘人、（內有曼遮斯德約五十人）眷屬的一百五十人、其確數據陶領事云、須俟本屆華僑登記結束後、方能查悉、</p>
<p>僑商營業分類、在最近三年內、計洗衣業一百家、飯館三家、雜貨六家、海員約二百家、近三年來各業均衰落不堪、飯館尤甚、洗衣業囚受英商創辦大規模洗衣業之競爭、營業遠不如昔、雜貨尙足維持、最大之雜貨店名廣泰源、爲台山人劉姓者所開、所有貨品、全屬國貨、但以食品及日用品爲多、書籍文具亦備有若干、該地僑商多屬粤省台山恩平等四人他省人較少、各僑商資本旣微薄、經營復墨守舊法、商店陳列、及招徠方法管理方法會計制度等、全屬舊式、加以英政府限制華僑業洗衣雜貨飯館者之入口、此項限制、近竟及於成年子弟之來英、故將來勢必至接替無人、歇業倒閉、</p>
<p>華僑敎育狀况、二十五年春季在利物浦之留學生、（公私費）共十四人、華僑子女在利物浦曁附近小學校者約五六十人、（記者在街上所見各小學生尙整潔活潑）現在英政府强迫敎育至十四歲爲止、故至十四歲後不問有無畢業小學、皆設法找尋工廠店鋪職業、間有一二因成績考試優等、得有學校津貼、而入高級學校者、此外無華僑小學及私塾、年前會有熱心敎育者擬籌設國文私塾、後以無法集資作罷、</p>
<p>華僑女子資質並不後人、有某女小學生八歲時得鋼琴演奏最優等獎、兼長華珂琳、現已十二歲矣、仍在校讀書、暇時則敎一粤公費生劉君學鋼琴云、有周姓華僑在利物浦大學讀生物化學、計自中學至大學、八年以來考試均得最優等、連年給予獎學金、除免費升學外、尙有餘資津貼家用、此君不識華文、但非常留心國事、國內消息、及要人言論之登載當地書報者、均剪下什襲珍藏、凡有公私費留學生到校、均來晤談、殷殷以祖國情形爲問、今年可得畢業學位、但將來在英無法覓事、回華又不諳國語、尙不知如何營生也、興言及此、願國內僑務委員會及外交部命令海外各地領事隨時調查此項優秀人才、設法使其袖習華文、並於畢業後設法介紹返國服務、能如此則國內建設可多得實用人才矣、</p>
<p>婚姻問題、——華僑在此、因來時挈眷不易、多另娶西女成家、據查西婦得嫁華僑、均甚滿意、　因多屬獨立經營之業務、　丈夫服侍太太、服侍子女、能任勞任怨、若嫁西人則多屬工人、家務處理、丈夫絕不帮忙、彼此比較、相去甚遠、有兩西女姊妹嫁兩華僑、各生子女七八人、（華僑多不節育）一人最近病歿醫院、妻子痛哭極哀、其平日之感情可知、僑胞嫁女、極不容易、大都低昂不就、西人多不屑與婚、而華人又多不樂與婚、回國出嫁、叉無川資、在此種種困難情况之下、夜間站立街頭、暫操神女生涯者、頗不乏人、是亦一大問題也、</p>
<p>華僑團體組織有致公堂一所、主持者每年推舉一次、如顧根福·劉毓操·梅棟·郭子向·黃郁等、均爲重要人物、內有香港大衆報·古巴僑報·滬粤報·等數種、聆其言論、極主張收復失地、恢復國權、而對於現代偉人、則最服膺胡展堂氏云、此外尙有國民黨支部、其工作較致公堂爲多、</p>
<p>國貨經營除數家雜貨舖外、悉屬英商、此等英商在中國亦有接洽、但其去取之權、全在英人手中、據陶領事之意見、以爲推廣國貨步驟、應從國內着手、　有組織健全之吾國出口商或工廠、　出品應由吾商人自己整理與劃一標準、（現在國貨出口均經在華之外商採集整理、故吾國商品在海外之市况、不問可知、）　吾商人應多多利用現有之使領館、指定某一種商品、囑其調查市情、　請五國海關於出日時抄錄外國之進口商號、俾便囑托使領館接洽、總之吾國商人應與駐外各領館切實聯絡、方可收指臂之效、不然各館每月之經濟商業報告、寄呈外交部選刋於外部公報者、對於實際推銷方法、了無裨益、查陶領事經騐充足、辦事認眞殊不可多得也、</p>
<p>至於曼遮斯德之領事館、係副領事館、據云曼市僑商從前最多四十人、現已增至四十七人、（眷屬在外）又國外公私留學生約四五十人、僑商營業全屬洗衣、計共二十一家、昔年獲利甚厚、多有出資置產者、近歲收入减少、僅數開支、子女均屬英國敎育與利僑同、無僑童私塾、華僑學生在高級學校者三數人、留學生有學生會、會長爲張根澞·周宗蓮·二人、此外無若何團體組織、交大學生及庚欵學生雖常有聚餐、但尙無永久之組織、僑商住處係在附近城市中心各地、國貨之銷於曼市者、以雞蛋爲大宗、茶葉及地毯次之、就逐年銷路低落之情况觀之、恐久後亦將至於絕跡、</p>
<p>查西人於蛋之保存、係用一種水玻璃（液體膠質）塗於蛋殼上、使內外隔絕、可保永久、此項水玻璃之三便士罐裝者、可塗雞蛋百個、不知我國蛋商是吾亦用同樣方法、</p>
<p>又查日貨之推銷於此地者、爲棉織品瓷器茶葉雞蛋鐵工品文具玩具等等、前有脚踏車推銷到此、每具只售十五先令左右、風行一時、後因政府限制推銷、而車商又拒不修理、遂漸歛跡、總之市上最輕巧最廉價者、什九係屬日貨、又凡日貨上必印（Foreign）字樣、意即洋貨、但其他歐美各國出品則無不逕標國名、日商之善於投機、至此可見一斑、</p>
<p>日人之紗織係從英國曼遮斯德學來、成功之後卽不復派遺留學生、不二十年間、靑出於藍、而勝於藍、日之棉織品竟充斥英國市面、英人至今猶談虎色變、返觀我國連年派遣留學實習、其成效若何、僑商之推銷國貨、其成效又若何、雖云日有自備海舶、而我無之、日有軍力財力爲後盾、而我無之、然推源溯本、其來有自、見兎顧犬、亡羊補牢、我國朝野上下當知所自勉矣、</p>
<p>又此間開演之辱華影片、大都來自美國、間有一二英國出品、其侮辱之程度雖較以前减輕、但鳩形鵠面之僑氓、拐帶越貨之僑盜、吸烟賭博之僑犯、仍現身說法、常常見之、間有受僱出席雜戲塲作下流舉動者、記者一怪華僑太無人格、（從無學識得來）經不起數先令之金錢引誘、不惜脫下慣穿之常服、改着離奇怪誕之破服怪裝、作下賤之舉動、二怪英美人不惜破壊國際感情、從不表演中國上流人士之可歌可泣的故事、只從低級趣味之下流舉動着想、博取普通觀衆之驚訝、三怪主僑務之職者不作積極的禁止加入表演、與消極的加以訓導、及隨時提出抗議、四怪吾國政府不自演電影出國宜傳、</p>
<p>華僑（及留學生）在校均受人重視、（因大都成績優異）但一出校門、踏入市街中心、則無處不受人輕視、（因受下流華僑之影響、）嗚呼、余尙何言、</p>

<h3>華北走私最近統計　五月四日至十日之一週間　稅收損失的一百八十萬元　去年八月至本年五月十日　稅收損失的共計二千萬元</h3>
<p>中央社記者、昨從海關方面探悉、關於華北走私之最近統計如下、　五月四日至十日之一週間、因由秦皇島·北戴河·南大寺·昌黎·留守營·等地運至天津東車站之私貨、而致稅收之損失、約計一百八十萬元、　自去年八月一日至本年五月十日、因走私貨物而損失之稅收、約計三千萬元、　上述五月四日至十日一週間運津之私貨、其種類如下、甲·人造絲三〇二五包或一三六一二五公斤·乙·白糖七〇七一七包或六三六四五三〇公斤·丙·捲烟紙四八七包或三〇二九一公斤、丁·疋頭三一一四箱、重量不詳、戊·雜貨八五九四箱、重量不詳、（註）戊項之雜貨、有媒油四七七五箱、（每箱十加侖）其餘爲乾海貨·食品·化裝品·電料·脚踏車零件·雨衣·牛酪·魚膠寬緊帶·手槍十八箱、及汽油五百箱、</p>
<p>孫科談話</p>
<p>立法院院長孫科氏、昨晨接見新聞記者、談及華北走私問題、孫氏之言曰、華北走私、現已成爲一嚴重之問題、此非僅中國之問題、抑日成爲國際問題矣、華北走私爲日方所縱容、此乃世人皆知之事實、實則華北走私、非特中國受重大之損失、而日本亦遭受無形之損失、蓋因華北走私、竟使成爲一嚴重之國際問題、此實爲日本最大之恥辱云、</p>
<p>商會徴詢</p>
<p>上海市商會、爲華北走私問題，關係重大、昨特分函糖業·呢絨業·棉布業·綢緞業·紙業·電器製造業·參燕業·等公會、徵詢對於此事之影響、函云、頃接胡執委西園來函、以華北走私蔓延幾及全國、不獨政府稅收受損、允足摧殘國民經濟、請爲召集全體委員、協議取締有效走私辦法、條陳政府施行等語、到會、茲擬先請貴公會將同業所受華北走私之影響、及目前所能辦到之杜絕走私方法、於本月二十日（卽下星期三）以前、函復本會、以便集會討論之際、較有準備、易收效果、務希查照、迅予辦理爲荷、</p>
<p>糖商影響</p>
<p>外論社譯大陸報云、本年開始三個月內、全國食糖之合法輸入數量、較諸去年同一時期、幾减少百分之五十、此種情形、皆華北私運所造成也、據海關方面之統計、本年三個月內、正當輸入糖類之價値、爲四·六零四·零二四金單位、去年同時期、則爲八·零五六·五六五金單位、然上述之數字、仍不足以表示中國正當糖業所受之打擊、因本年開始三個月內所輸入之糖類、其中百分之八八十、係去年歲底時所訂購者也、中國之糖業、雖有百分之六十、係在上海市塲、但華北方面、亦佔百分之十以上、華南方面佔百分之卅、目下私運貨物之數量、除人造絲以外、當以糖類爲最大、本年開始以後、由秦皇島及榆關兩地私運入境者、約在七五·〇〇〇噸左右、上述之數量、實可驚人、因其佔全國一二三四月內消費總額三分之一也、倘糖類之私運、長此不已、則在本年以內、勢將有私糖二二五·〇〇〇噸、由華北私運入境、目下所有私糖、雖皆用日本牌號、但其中實未必悉屬日貨、爪哇之糖產、亦佔一大部份、蓋其運至日本時、皆係粗貨、在日提煉後、再行輸出來華也、日本國內所消費之食糖、則多爲台灣糖廠之出產云、自本年一月以來、由華北私運入境之糖類、已逐漸侵入內地、津滬兩地之糖業、已被其破壤無遺、其中尤以滬商所受之打擊爲最大、因華中及華西兩部之糖市、本皆由滬商供給者也、</p>

<h3>皖贛紅茶運銷處　昨商各項問題　實部令國際貿易局加以指導外國茶商明日再度舉行會議</h3>
<p>申時社云、皖贛紅茶運銷委员会、會於昨日上午十時假揚子飯店召開會議、安徽省政府建設廳長劉貽燕、特於十五日夜車抵滬、主持一切、昨日出席者、除劉氏外、計有安徽省政府財政廳代表陳言、盧兆梅、何崇傑、江西財政應代表歐陽彥謨、及皖贛紅茶運銷處總經理稈振基·副經理曾震·崔中·等十餘人、由劉貽燕主席、討論皖贛紅茶運銷上之各項問題、及滬銷處內部問題、結果頗爲圓滿至十二時午餐散會、茲悉安徽建應長劉貽燕、因任務未了、在滬尙有二三日勾留、預定星期一二返皖、</p>
<p>實部指導</p>
<p>申時社記者向皖贛紅茶運銷處探悉、連日由贛皖二省祁門·宜城·安慶·三處運來茶葉、達二千數百箱、現時已屆夏茶、新貨均已裝製竣事、而滬上運銷總處成立、對於以後向外銷路、將有莫大裨益、故各茶商頗表合作·所有茶葉將再源源運滬、實業部曾令上海國際貿易局、對於皖贛紅茶運銷事宜、予以指導、江西省政府主席熊式輝、安徽省政府主席劉鎭華、亦均函請國際貿易局對皖贛運銷處、予以恊助、</p>

<h3>顧知龢攷察歸來　暢談日本絲業　政府人民金融界通力合作　蠶絲總產量較我國增十倍　週後卽晋京報吿考察經過</h3>
<p>申時社云、實業部特派赴日考察專員顧知龢女士、在日考察三月、業已事畢、於昨日下午四時、乘日郵船上海丸歸國抵滬、顧氏所天許兆鳳及弟妹友好多人到埠歡迎、顧氏考察所得、定週後晋京、向部報吿、記者昨於輪决訪晤顧氏、茲將其談話誌下、</p>
<p>在日考察三月</p>
<p>顧氏首調、本人此决奉命赴日考察、係於本年二月間、向蘇州友聲葑溪蠶種塲請假、由滬啟程、總計在日三月、專門考察蠶絲及其附作物、本人抵日後、蒙日政府當局熟忱招待、及我國駐日大使館領事館領導、與個人親友方面之協助、考察工作、進行頗爲順利、歷經日本蠶絲中心區茨城·王子·羣島·九洲·等大城市、作普遍之考察、凡各大蠶絲製作塲所、均往參觀、從事深切之探討、</p>
<p>進步值得仿效　日本蠶絲事業之進步、成續頗佳、蓋日本所有蠶絲事業、在技術上非特完全科學化、且得政府領導於前、人民努力於後、金融界從旁調劑、眞所謂通力合作値得仿效、故其產量之增加、近年來亦突飛猛進、約略的加以統計、最近日本蠶絲之總產量、較諸我國、足有十倍之多、反觀國內蠶線事業、殊有急起　追、從事改進之必要、庶免漸趨淘汰之途、而求蠶絲事業循軌而進、以挽救農村經濟發展國內工商業、切實要務、</p>
<p>質地較遜我國　但就蠶絲質地方面言、日本絲質、遠不及我、其最易分別者、即我國絲質有　性、日本絲質則無之、因此所出絲織物、自以我國為耐用、此為天然關係、而非科學或人力所能左右、故我國絲業、茍能極力改進、深信必可立於不敗之地、現在國內改進蠶絲之初步手續、（改良製造塲）進行已有多年、其次如繅絲方面、亦在進行中、至於培植桑樹之改良及其他一切蠶絲附作物、可望於最短期內完全改良、故我國蠶絲前途、不久當亦能與各國媲美、</p>
<p>技術媲美歐美</p>
<p>最後談及日本工業方面、據謂、日本工業、原屬輕工業居多數、但最近已由輕工業而漸趨於重工業、製造技術、已與歐美工業先進諸國相媲美、惟原料方面、似非採諸國外、不敷其用、日本工業界、雖認此爲最大之缺點、但亦無法彌補云云、聞顧氏在滬休息數日、約一星期後晉京、謁實業部吳部長、報吿考察經過、</p>

<h3>我國木材乾溜工業之嚆矢</h3>
<p>— 周榕</p>
<p>江南化學工業製造廠一瞥</p>
<p>一·引言　木材乾溜，在化學工業本身言，其重要僅次於三酸工業，而在我國現狀下，其意義與需要，尤為深切，蓋木材乾溜之產品，均為工業上直接間接之原料，姑以醋酸一項而論，在上海一隅，用於印染工廠，年達二百萬磅以上，其餘如木精之於醫藥，木焦油之於塗料，木炭之於家用，亦非少數，今後工業進展，需要當更隨之激增，是可斷言，况據歐美一般化學家研究，乾溜半製品，經精密提鍊，產物可達三十餘種之多，其次要者如丙酮（CH3COCH3）甲醛（HCHO）　（C6H6）石炭酸（Carbolic　Acid）木油（Cresoate）等，俱係化學或醫藥上之要品，至其原料木柴，祇須質地堅實，纖維豐富，如　，懈，櫟等樹是，雖不能成器之細瘦彎曲者，均甚適用，查此項樹木，生長至易，我國未墾山地旣多，產量極豐，即如浙江湖屬一帶，沃野連綿，年產亦在百萬擔左右，其他如東北，皖，鄂，滇，桂，等省，尤有可觀，惜迄未利用，平時祇作薪炭，有如廢物，果能應用之於工業，裨益農村，實非淺鮮，江南化學工業製造廠，即為我國首創唯一之木材乾溜廠，前途展望，未可限量。</p>
<p>二·工廠簡史該廠於二十二年夏籌備設立，廠址位於閘北共和新路柳營路口，初係上海印染公司徐時行葛桂棠兩氏所創辦，聘吳浩然君為工程師，裝置機械，幾經試製，至二十三年六月醋酸始得問世，然因設備簡陋，度分不足，難於銷售，旋商請薛濟明博士設法改善，薛氏觀察結果，認為原有設備，不足供給工業製造，非另行集資設計工場不可，徐葛　氏，從其建議，乃放棄自有股本，以發起人名義，添招新股，爾時沈仲毅等氏，感於木材乾溜工業之重要，毅然加入，工場設計，由薛氏負責主持，向國內外定造機器，迨二十四年初，趙賜琛趙也辰諸氏復贊助加入，是年四月，股本足額，六月中，機械裝置完竣，九月間，醋酸，木精，木焦油等，正式躉售，品質純良，足與舶來品相抗衡，故自出貨以來，銷路至為暢旺，綜上所述，該廠自籌備以至出貨，費時達二年之久，多次改革，始吿成功，基本工業創剏之艱，於此可見一般。</p>
<p>三，製造程序（甲）原料：該廠所用之原料，除木柴係向浙江湖屬一帶採辦外，硫酸由開成造酸廠供給，因雙方訂有互助契約，故價格特為低廉，石灰煤塊，則就近向本埠行商定購，均屬國產。</p>
<p>（乙）乾溜：乾溜部有自建德國美罕水平式（Meyer　Hannover　Horizontal　Tvpe）乾溜灶一座，並列乾溜鑵（Retort）四具，鑵面裝有冷却器四座，中舖　軌，柴車即由此出入，每一乾溜鑵，可容柴車三輛，柴車入鑵後，將蓋固封，灶下燃煤，約歷十小時，鑵　木柴因熱而蒸發，成氣體由烟道上　，過木焦油分離機，油因重下沉，放出而為粗製木焦油，餘氣上昇，用抽氣機吸入冷却塔，塔內冷水循環，化成液體，入木醋液池（Pyroligneous　Acid　Tank），一部份不能液化可燃性之餘氣，迥入乾溜灶燃燒之，如有過剩，由導管輸放空中。</p>
<p>（丙）中和：池內之木醋液，用唧筒打入樓上之中和桶，中和桶計五隻，加入適量之石灰，使之中和，並以攪拌機打拌均勻，歷六小時，再行打入對方之沉澱桶，沉澱桶之作用有二，使中和液內之木焦油雜質，可以下沉，不致混入此後之木精及醋酸鈣內，此其一·尚未終畢之中和作用，可以充分完成，此其二·沉澱時間約一晝夜，然後放入木精粗製機。</p>
<p>（丁）木精蒸溜：木精粗製機計有二座，係單一蒸溜器（Simple　Distillation　Apparatus），熱力取用蒸氣，利用沸點之不同（按木精之沸點為660C醋酸為1180C），木精先行氣化而出，經冷却管凝成液體，即得綠黃色之粗製木精，粗製木精加入　量硫酸，再入木精精製機分溜一次，即得澄清凈純之木精。</p>
<p>（戌）分解：剩留木精粗製機內之醋酸鈣液，因水份過多，必先經濃縮機濃縮之，去除大量水份，濃縮機係雙效式之蒸發器（Doubie　Effect　Evaporalor），利用各效壓力之不同，以增加蒸發之效能，醋酸鈣液經濃縮後，再入雙軸乾燥機及烘板烘乾之，乾燥後之灰褐色醋酸鈣，然後送入分解機，分解機有二座，內裝拌動機及真空機，先將醋酸鈣與硫酸成分配就後，依法放入分解機內而蒸之，同時　拌動機使不停頓，並用真空機加速分解，粗製醋酸遂導流而出。</p>
<p>（己）醋酸蒸溜：由前所得之粗製醋酸，含有水份及雜質甚多，故必需續絆再製機提鍊之，再製機與木精精製機，構造原理相同，不過醋酸之沸點，較高於水，是以最初蒸出之液體，係極稀之醋酸，待溫度抵達醋酸沸點時，可得百分之九十以上之濃醋液，最後經醋酸精製機蒸溜之，則出百分之九十八以上之冰醋酸。</p>
<p>四·產銷狀况該廠現時出品，計有醋酸，木精，木焦油，木炭等四種；醋酸每日產量六十　，品質優良，成分在百分之九十八以上，悉由本外埠印染及油漆等工廠，定購採用，木精係製變性酒精，隔木木林（消毒用及電木原料）　珞璐及翳藥等用原料，每日可出七百磅，成分百分之九十七，與舶來品相等，現由聯順公司經銷，頗得外界之歡迎，木焦油係防腐防銹之良好塗料，木炭係家用燃料，前者每日生產六千磅，後者可一百三十担，由勝達顏料號及慶大煤炭號分別承銷，營業暢旺。</p>
<p>五·發展方針該廠今後進展之方針，一方充實工程設備，使產量增加，品質益求精良，一方並擬提製丙酮木油等，藉可供給化學，醫藥上之需要，此外並將着手由木精　裂福爾木林以至電木紛，醋酸提製阿司匹靈及上等醋酸，木炭鍊製活性炭素，均在研究計劃中：日後全部成功，實足為國貨工業放一異彩，固不僅杜塞巨額漏巵巳也。（完）</p>

<h3>全國敎玩具展覽會今晨開幕　會期十三日共七九二二件</h3>
<p>（南京十六日電）全國兒童敎具玩具展覽會籌備竣事、定十七日晨在國貨陳列館開幕、會期十三日、十七日晨七時半、由王敎長夫人剪綵後、即招待各機關代表及個人參觀、其餘各日經分別規定爲個人或團體參觀日期、此决應徵展品、據統計結果、敎具部分共三千叫百廿六件、以自然科爲最多、决爲勞作美術、再决算術幼稚園最少、玩具部分共四千四百九十六件、以動物爲最多、决爲家具、再决國防玩偶裝飾最少、出品省市計有蘇浙冀豫皖贛鄂湘晋陝魯閩桂察京滬靑威津平漢等廿一省市、以京最多、晋皎少、父外國玩具以日最多、英最少、展品均依其性質功用、令類陳列、計分八室、俾易獲得質量比較、</p>
<p>舉行的旨趣　全國兒童年實施委昌會</p>
<p>全國兒童敎具玩具展覽會、經長期的籌備、已經大規模在首都開幕了、</p>
<p>敎具的展覽、以前在各地方雖有舉行的、但是規模不大、玩具的展覽、民國初年前北京敎育部雖也曾舉行過一决、但是規模也很簡陋、這次的舉行、展覽時期、自二十五年五月十七日起、到五月二十六日止、共計十天、各方的出品、全國小學自製的、各工廠商店仿製創製的、蘇聯·日本·歐美各國送來參考的、共計有二萬多件、而且形形色色、五花八門、其中不少有價値的東西、比了二十年前的敎具玩具、眞是不可同日而語、這在我國、不能說不是破天荒的盛舉吧、我們不惜「勞師動衆」舉行這樣的盛會、意義果何在呢、我們以爲——</p>
<p>敎具是敎學的利器、要增進敎具的效率、非置備敎具改進敎具不可、「工欲善其事、必先利其器」道是一定的道理、沒有網　　不能漁獵、沒有耒耜、不能農耕、沒有一切手工具、就沒有手工業、沒有一切機械、就沒有機械工業、……這是很顯明的歷史事實、同樣敎具和敎學的關係、也非常顯著、沒有器械標本、就不能敎學自然、沒有工作用具、就不能敎學勞作、……即使都有、而不合用、不經濟、敎學的效率、也會因之向低减、所以敎具是敎學的必需品、而且應當充實·改進、在敎學上非常重要、</p>
<p>玩具是充實兒童生活、擴展兒童智慧和興趣的寳貝、要兒童的衝動和能力、得以正當地發展、便非給以玩具、給以有敎育價値的玩具不爲功、人是愛玩愛動的動物、成人有的遊山玩水、有的吟風弄月、有的愛好藝術、有的愛好運動、……各依性之所近、各自玩弄各自活躍、因此造成了有　義的世界、現代的文明、實在也就是人類玩和動的產物、小孩的愛玩愛動和成人差不多、因爲身心正在發育的緣故、形式上的愛玩愛動、或者比成人還來得顯著些、成人有職業、兒童沒有職業、成人玩和動的範圍廣機會多、兒童則除了跳躍號叫於里巷村落之間以外便很少玩和動的機會了、要是沒有玩具給他們玩、叫兒童何以「聊生」、要是沒有有敎育價値的玩具給他們玩、何能使他們增益智慧而不致玩物喪志」、所以玩具是兒童的必需品、而且應當充實改進以利兒童、在敎育上也　着極重要的地位、</p>
<p>因爲敎具玩具都具有重要性、所以本會在這兒童年的過程中、特地舉行這一個展覽會、其目的不外下列三點、</p>
<p>喚起社會人士對於敎具玩具的注意　我們覺得我國社會人士、對於敎具玩具、太漢視了、所以我們的小學敎學、多數是死敎書、死讀書、連自然勞作、也往往是「紙上談兵」、很少實際的試騐和操作、我們的兒童也多數是閒着逛着、或者無聊取叫囂跳躑、或者蠢如鹿豕沒有一點兒聰明活潑的氣槪、我們鄭重其事地開道一决展覽大會、把全國的敎具玩具和外國的參考品、分別陳列以供展覽、我們希望大家在展覽之後、會感到敎具玩具的重耍、對於敎具玩具都十分注意學校、從此以敎具爲利器、家庭從此以玩具爲寳貝、不再和從前一樣視爲無足重輕、</p>
<p>鼓動敎具玩具的仿製和創製　我們覺得我們的敎具玩具、在這二十多年的時期中、因爲學校、工廠各方面的努力、已經仿作創作了不少、比從前大有進步了、但是外國的出品、仍舊充滿了我們的市塲　、我們的學校家庭、還是多量地採用外國出品、足見我國的敎具玩具還不能勝過外國的敎具玩具、或者我國的敎具玩具雖然很有進步、外國的敎具玩具、進步更多、或者我國的敎具玩具、雖然可和外國的敎具玩具並駕齊驅或且過之、可是散處在全國各地方、因爲經濟和環境的關係、不能爭得市場、反不及外國的出品那樣在市塲　上通行無阻、道一次展覽會、集全國精華於一堂、還有許多外國的新出品、附帶陳列、以供參考、我們希望學校工廠在展　之後、格外努力、學別人的長處、多量仿製、或者參考了別人的出品、推陳出新、創製出新的東西來、以使我國敎具玩具的製造比從前更加進步、並且一有組織地推廣於全國市場、以供學校家庭採用、甚或推銷到國外去以與世界各國爭衡、</p>
<p>謀敎眞玩具的改進　我們以爲敎具玩具是應常精益求精的、製造者固然應當製造出優良的出品來、採用者也得愼重選揮、專取優良的物品、我國製造者、或者不知何謂優良、只知一味製造、所以出品優劣互見、好壊雜陳、大有「出門不認貨」的樣子、採用者、也往往只看形式、不問作用、隨便置備、這在兒童敎育方面看來、是很帶危險性的、這一次展覽會把我國固有的敎具玩具和我國以及各國新興的教具玩具、一起陳列起來、並且請了許多專家、加以評判獎勵優良的出品、我們希望製造者和採用者、在這决展覽之後、心目中至少都有一個何謂優良的概念、將來人家能够專製造或採用優良的敎具玩具、以使敎具玩具精益求精學校用了、更增進敎學效能、兒童玩了、更發生興趣、增長智慧、</p>
<p>這次展覽會、承各方贊助、踴躍出品、我們十分感謝、各外國允其是蘇俄日本、也誠意地送東西來、供我們參考、我們更應當表示謝忱、我們現正籌備設置中央兒童敎育館、展覽之後、當把展覽品（除了聲諸發還的以外）珍藏起來、　中央兒童敎育館成立之後、移送過去長期陳列、希望不致辜負了出品者的一番苦心、我們並目致謝參加籌備的各機關和各僩人、始終爲展覽會盡力、</p>
<p>最後我們、希望首都人士相率來會參觀多多批評指敎、不勝歡迎榮幸之至、</p>

<h3>證券　債市呈外强中乾狀</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所因環境刺激性、略見减退、市况呆定、交易因亦驟少、惟大戶多頭、尙在覓求出路、適逢週六、檯面狹窄、多頭出籠、每感缺乏對手、形勢顯有外强中乾之象、自借欵之說證實虛妄後、而走私形勢、適更見擴大而嚴重、關稅已感受極大影響、檯面雖暫吿平靜、而雙方壁壘尙高、短時期內、必將搖動、允以川帮之多頭有數百萬居於浮而不實之地位、本月份爲日無多、故叫號及三十五號等已在緩緩出籠、且多方自經借欺謠言之後、籌碼增加、愈覺積重難返、做多實尙非其時也、昨日經過、上午開盤、繼續跌一角至四角、大都以叫號及三十五號賣出爲最多、十一號則頗有置進、决盤賣氣稍殺、散戶頗有進胃、十一號復有買進、回上五分一角至二角、惟覺遠期較近期爲弱、午後開盤、初則繼續抬高三四角、入後仍覺振作不起、且丙甲兩種之遠期、均有倒掛形勢、收盤交易極淸、丁種完全未有做開、餘亦互有高低、大都爲掉期交易而已、市價結果、除　種獨好一角及三角半外、餘則均小五分至一角半不等、成交總數、共計四百五十六萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較別表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　驚風駭濤之後　紗花復歸平靜　流言平息人心轉定　棉花猶較紗市爲昂</h3>
<p>紗連朝狂風暴雨之紗市、仿則暫吿平靜、因市上謠言平息、中美貨幣恊定問題、當局亦發表切實談話、於是人心安穩、塲　中交易大减、多空兩方均持觀望熊度、但大戶吸收之額、仍無舉動、前途變化、殊難逆料也、</p>
<p>標紗檯面稍見鬆濫　標紗前市開盤、近月微跌二·三·六·七角、但拍至遠期、以多方仍不動聲色、略漲二·三角、但二盤以後、趨勢異常平靜、與上日之鋒鋩畢露之家、大相逕庭、實緣流言平息、人氣較定、一般投機商、以連日猛跌在漲、亦覺筋疲力盡、暫時休息、結果各月參差不一、漲跌二·三·六·四·角、午後開盤、場中交易不旺、檯面稍見鬆濫、各月均跌三·四五·六角、二三盤仍無榮辱、迨至收盤、有空頭抵補、略形回上、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌二·四·五角、查賣出聚興七百包、大豐一千一百包、合興七包、森康五百包仁豐六百五十包、元一八百包、大昌成二千三百五十包、同和一千四百五十包、晋康九百包、達記一千二百包、長豐一千七百五十包、買進通記八百包、錦昌九百五十包、明德七百五十包、賡豐三千八百五十包、興昌二千一百五十包、恊成七百五十包、生源一千五百五十包、元一一千二百包、晋康七百包、信誠七百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>內地　四五　漢口　五</p>
<p>棉市平靜、因謠言平息、人心稍定、但趨勢羅紗市為昂、以印美棉市轉好、本月收貨之說未絕、同時現棉日商採辦殊勤、不過買者不若以前之擁擠、然成交籌碼之旺、創造交易所以來之新紀錄云、</p>
<p>標花形勢平疲帶堅　標花前市開盤、因美棉平凡、漲跌互見、惟印棉漲一羅比至　羅比半、大阪三品花漲一·二角、市場人氣略好、且多頭對於本月收貨之意仍濃、各月均漲二角至三角、場中交易較少、因此缺乏變化、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲五分至一角、午後開盤、形勢平疲而帶緊，因現棉廠需、日商購買獨旺、人心稍昂，結果各月比上午收盤價均漲五分至一角半、查賣出聚興一千七百担、大孚一千一百担、愼記七千九百担、元一五千六百担、潤康一千五百担、生源二千五百祖、永大一千三百担、振大一千三百担、長豐二千八百担、買進通記二千一百担，益裕一千二百担、明德三千五百担、賡豐七千五百担、長豐四千六百担、協成一千三百担、新昶二千七百担、晋康二千担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉日廠購買獨旺　現棉消費、日商紗廠購買獨多、華廠進胃未開、來源姚花二百九十包、</p>
<p>本月紗花廿九交割　本市紗布交易所五月期標準紗花、茲定於本月二十九日舉行紗花交割、二十六·二十七·二十八三日、停止本月期紗花交易、交割日市場一律停止集會、</p>
<p>美新陳棉市價參差</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、新陳棉市價參差、七月期有多頭了結、十月期有棉農套賣、而七月期與十月期間更有掉期交易、其後七月期同業需耍較佳、買戶則遲疑不前、新棉在一角零五釐左右、有人買進、囤棉處則於一角一分六釐三毫時、售出五月期、海斯德氏估計本週廠用爲一二六、〇〇〇包、利物浦存底爲三二五、〇〇〇包、最後同業買進、並有補空、市况穩定、計現貨漲七磅音、期貨漲跌一二磅音、英棉現貨漲一點、期貨漲二至叫點、印棉期貨商及歐洲出口商買進、但有棉農套賣及多頭了結、計平果爾漲○。五至一羅比、奧姆辣漲二·二五至二·五羅比、白羅溪漲二·二五至三羅比、原電錄左、（十五日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十六日七八月期白羅溪花開盤預測、爲二百零一一羅比、較上日跌半羅比、</p>
<h3>三品紗花平穏</h3>
<p>十六日大阪電、三品期紗漲跌一角至三角、近月爲一百九十六元、遠月爲一百九十六元五角、期棉漲五分至一角、近月爲六十叫元一角、遠月爲六十元一角、</p>
<p>美棉週末統計（單位千包）</p>
<p>埃及棉週末統計（單位康泰）</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布銷路亦見平淡</h3>
<p>昨日棉市、因紗花風波已吿平靜、市面轉淸、現銷未能邁走前進、業中都取冷觀態度、內外廠四君子嗶嘰、由行家首批開出一百數十箱、價二角一分半、二批索價二角一分七五、北路烟台帮進三五十箱爲最多、天津帮略進大生十六磅雙龍粗布二十包、價八元四角半、慶豐十六磅雙魚吉慶粗布、前昨共進五十餘包、價八元三角五分、漲起二分半、市上十六磅五福粗布、本街連續購進五六十包、現貨匱乏、查各廠十六磅粗布、經各客帮及軍衣業採購後、頗形緊俏、價格微升二分半五分之譜、</p>
<h3>闊幅膠布居奇漲價</h3>
<p>幅寬三十六寸之東貨白膠布、目前正當銷令、京滬杭走銷甚盛、而來源不豐、致供不敷售、市價昨已增漲二分、其執有整箱現貨者尙無人在、買方候用、先行預交付定洋、待月底邊新貨到來交貨、致近日同業中存有此闊幅膠布者、多居奇漲價、每碼减沽五角四分、老刀牌五角七分、</p>
<h3>糧食　有大戶拉抬　六月期粉所漲獨多</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈先疲後穩之象、以洋來報價、芝加哥好一二角左右、坎拿大好四分一角不等、開價時因天時頗佳、人心繼軟、六月份開祗三元零三分、遠期亦落一分左右、惟六月份因大戶續進、即爲拉住、市面亦即升提、其餘月份、交易未暢、價呈定局、迨至下午開盤、六月份初尙平靜、後因出戶甚稀、經多頭一拉、價好一二分、七月份以下、交易甚少、幷以週六之故、浮空頗有抵補、是以市氣亦稍穩固、據業中人之推測、六月份爲新陳交接、變化必多、七月份以下、純屬新粉、市氣當看平疲、至標準現貨、仍喊三元三角半云、</p>
<h3>出新尙遠　期麥賣買均觀望</h3>
<p>昨日期麥、上午圖盤、各月份市呈岑寂之態、因氣候雖漸睛正、惟距出新時期、究屬尙遠、故業內外之賣買、又轉觀望、更以貨幣謠傳不一客戶拋貨、遂多中止、是以趨勢雖疲、跌度則祇二三分、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易未暢、價呈盤旋、以後必須新麥已有把握、市面方有正式之開展耳、現麥市面、廠方以粉銷不旺、進意甚淡、故特高貨又受便殺、如南宿州蚌埠麥、已跌至四元六角三分、且祇做開五六百包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<p>美國小麥　市况、因廠市穩定、國外作物報吿不佳、故市况稍形穩定、惟暫時恐無大漲之望、</p>
<h3>到貨雖稀河米猶無起色</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、近二十號、本街銷場依然呆滯、大連龍口帮續辦包子七八百包、故市况仍平疲、早厚粳見低五分、薄稻尙平、杜川尖帶軟、陰變元平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船廿八九號、市上白粳去路平淡、價形又見疲軟三四分、薄稻高挺、中决平定、陰元仍定、白元零胃稍動、濟南稍有包胃、市價高定、中决稍帶緊勢、羊杜尖平定、埠客尖零銷淡弱、價形又帶軟勢、其餘各貨、價似和平之勢、</p>
<h3>客秈市面依然不振</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭仍枯、但天氣晴暖、存米充足、行團客戶均恐久擱有變、多主在市貶價早脫、故高决各檔冉度回小、高貨續小四五分、中决者小去六七分至近角不一、且去路內地已滯、泉州觀望、統市仍祇本街單帮應酬、全日開出，，贛米一千六百三十包、溫台米一千三百廿五包、暹糙五十包、盡係本街辦去、</p>
<h3>絲茶　私貨人絲到滬漸少</h3>
<p>一百二十號天橋牌人絲、走私貨仍爲三百零五六元、海關標出者三百二十至四十元、成交寥寥無數、興昌號所講進之海關標賣貨、昨日售出一百五十號金鷄牌無光六十八包、（每二十包爲一箱）、價每箱四百元、一百五十號金三馬牌有光三百二十二包、價三百七十三元、本埠綢廠並購進一百五十號三樹牌無光數箱、價三百七十五元、近來私貨轉運艱難、到貨减少、蓋各車站碼頭並沿途關卡、緝查非常嚴厲、即現私貨銷路、亦殊滯弱、以前運到之諸貨、有大批尙未能脫手者、</p>
<h3>紅茶暢銷綠茶呆滯</h3>
<p>瀰州紅茶大量運滬　近日溫州紅茶、因英莊銷路尙佳、價亦堅定、頗引起一部份茶商之注意、除該地茶號積極採製外、前昨兩日又由商家辦來袋茶一千三百餘包、已由製茶廠家、趕製裝箱佈樣、以供洋商需要云、</p>
<p>遂安珍眉歐銷不振　昨洋莊綠茶市况、英法各莊有家、因法國法郞貶價影響、非國外來電需購、不敢收辦、此决遂安珍眉新茶到滬、英莊行家並不注意、致認價更低、至土莊綠茶、僅祇安頂湖州等路高莊貨、及抽芯珍眉、略有去路、溫州紅茶、亦有零星走銷、全市成交紅綠茶、共計二百四十餘箱、</p>
<p>據本市茶棧業公會報吿　自本月六日開盤以來、至今已有十日、土莊珍眉成交共一千六百五十六件、向以恊和進辦較多、但一週來市價已跌去十餘元、溫州珍眉亦僅售出一　六十八件、遂安珍眉已到千餘件、而僅永發開盤進辦六十七件外、餘無進辦者、</p>
<h3>海味　帶絲海帶銷塲均呆　市面殊覺平疲</h3>
<p>海帶　刻接日本來訊、今庚各產地、新貨出水、均報歉收、惟濱中離島、尙稱豐盛、預的再遲一月、新貨即可到滬、現查街存陳貨、數已不多、而客路生意、則仍甚沉寂、故行號售盤、刻均願意削價脫手、昨市根室帶八元七角、濱中厚岸八元五六角、國后川路八元四角、首長八元、貓足六元二角、二番六元、三番五元五角、比較前盤、各檔又續跌二三角、因客帮需要懈怠、殊少問津之人、</p>
<p>帶絲　市亦平疲、惟廂館貨較缺、售價十元零二角、大阪貨存　銷稀、市故步鬆、變龍高貨、僅售八元四角、靑龍七元八角、雜牌七元五角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　高魁耳產價堅定　新貨約六月下句可登塲</h3>
<p>木耳近以到存均少、去胃平淡、市轉定勢、如高宜昌耳、開過一百元、次貨八十四五元、四川耳前盤為一百十五元、現叫原價未成、漢口市價據函訊近亦持定、高檔九十元、次八下七八元、魁耳以貨少較堅、地價一百五十元、此間行盤航空小包耳、叫一百零五元、雜牌决至九十元不一、原貨雜耳一百零二元、新貨大的須六月下旬可以登塲、</p>

<h3>旅行和研究自然界</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我們出外旅行，除了欣賞自然界的風景之外，還得注意研求自然界的學問，因爲自然界太廣大了，無處不包含着極珍貴的智識，古人說；「落花水面皆文章」就是這個意思。</p>
<p>我們在自然課上，或許已研究過了桃花，可是在你沒有看見桃花以前，你關於桃花的智識是不切實的。你和自然界接觸，非但可以印證你已經求得的學問，並且還可發現許多新奇有趣的知識哩！</p>
<p>自然界是世間最完備的學校，課程的廣博，完善，新奇，有趣，是沒有一個學校一能比得上它的，並且自然界的學問最是切實　有用，是沒有一本書本能比得上的。</p>
<p>一個外國的學者說：「當你散步在郊外的時候，要張開你的眼睛。」爲什麽要張　我們的眼睛呢？便是呌我們仔細地研究自然界的一切現象呀呀！</p>
<p>小朋友們，遊山玩水可以陶冶我們的性情，可是別忘了研究這萬花筒似的自然界。</p>
<h3>漢奸秦檜</h3>
<p>— 洪石鯨</p>
<p>小朋友，你在書中該看見過岳飛的故事吧？精忠的岳飛在死命的抵禦金兀朮時，秦檜竟受了金兀朮的賄，甘心做賣國的漢奸，假皇帝的名義，用十二道金牌，把岳飛從前方召回京城害死。</p>
<p>小朋友，秦檜何以要受金兀朮的賄，甘心做漢奸呢？他唯一的希望，無非想在金人保護下做一個有名無實的傀儡皇帝：金元朮所以來利用秦檜，也無非是想借秦檜來扮演一齣傀儡戲，目的在吞沒中國。秦檜這樣不顧自己的祖國，願意殘害精忠勇敢的岳飛，去在敵人面前獻媚，耍功，做升官發財的工具，你說可恨不可恨？</p>
<p>岳飛死後的遺骸，不是葬在西子湖嗎？後人痛恨這一個無廉恥的漢奸—秦檜—，造了他的鐵像跪在岳飛的墓前，表示算做漢奸的懲罰。</p>
<p>這還沒有消除我們心頭之恨，於是又有人用麵粉做成小條來代表秦檜，放在鍋裹炸，再吃在肚要。這就是汕炸燴（燴與檜同聲）。</p>
<p>小朋友，你看漢奸的下塲　是如此如此。</p>

<h3>動物傳達消息的方法</h3>
<p>— 陳世聰</p>
<p>我們人類有語言，可以用語言來傳達消息。可是，小動物用什麽方法來傳達消息的呢？下面我便是把幾種動物不同的傳達消息的方法，介紹給小朋友們，我想小朋友們一定都很歡迎的吧！</p>
<p>小朋友們，當你失落了一塊糖或一些餅乾在地上，假使被一個螞蟻發現了以後，它便會召集了許多的同類來把它搬進洞去。它們的傳達消息的工具，便是頭上的一對觸角，小朋友，你不是曾經看見過兩個螞蟻在觸角對觸角互相接觸的螞？那時，它們便是在傳達消息呀！</p>
<p>兎子幾乎是完全不能發音，因爲一發音，便要引起敵人的注意。但是，它們能够把後足聲着地上，敲出各種不同的聲調來互相傳達消息。</p>
<p>美洲的羚羊傳達消息的方法，是非常的奇巧，當它遇到敵人的時候，它臀部上的一大塊白毛，便會立刻的豎了起來，在陽光中閃耀着，好像一面鏡子一般，這種炫目的白瑰，便是告訴它的同伴，有敵人來侵襲了！趕快逃避，其他像麋鹿也有這種回光信號，來傳佈它們的警號。</p>
<h3>鎳幣不能放在嘴裏咬</h3>
<p>— 顏鑫泉</p>
<p>過去的不久，—大的是四月十九日十在本報的兒童專刊上，看到一位著名「仁」君的大作，題名已經遺忘，不過大的的意思記得是這樣的：「鎳幣何故能被磁石吸起」文中有。節產涉到鎳幣眞僞的辨別，大概說：僞造的鎳幣，光暗淡，用力咬後，有齒印；眞的鎳幣，光明亮，用力咬後，無齒印。</p>
<p>這種辨別眞僞的方法，倒的確可說一聲是簡便之至！我知道小朋友們看了這簡便的方法，一定是牢記在心頭，倘若逢到有鎳幣的時候，又定要試咬否準確的！</p>
<p>不過，這種試咬的方法，我認爲是很不妥善的！因爲一枚流通已久的鎳幣，那麽在其上面，不免有相當數目的病菌附着，現在我們要辨別這鎳幣的眞僞，貿然放到嘴裹去咬，那不是一樁很危險的事嗎？而且，用力咬後，牙齒也要受相當的損塲！所以希望一般小朋友不要拿這種方法來試騐鎳幣的眞僞，因爲於衛生上是有很大的妨礙的。不過小朋友果然應該注意，成人們也須戒之！</p>

<p>三面臨海的愛沙尼亞</p>
<p>地形　　國旗　　首都　　街市　　男孩　　女孩</p>
<p>和海周鄰居　愛沙尼亞這個歐洲小國，好像歡喜和海做鄰居似的，三面都臨着海。伊北臨芬蘭灣，西臨波羅的海，南臨里加灣。東西和蘇聯相接。因此，海岸很長，而且很是曲折呢．</p>
<p>新興的小國　在蘇聯十月革命之前，世界上還沒有愛沙尼亞國這個名字呢。原來伊本是蘇聯的一省，蘇聯十月革命之後，脫離蘇聯，自己成立一國。不久，各國都承認伊，一九二〇年，蘇聯也承認伊獨立。</p>
<p>三色的國旗　世界上以三色拼成　旗的國家有好幾個，如法蘭西的·藍·白·紅·羅馬尼亞的藍·黃·紅，秘魯的紅　紅，十都顏色是很美麗的，這裏面要算憂沙尼亞的國旗的顏色圾暗淡了，原來伊是用藍，黑，白三色拼成的啊。</p>
<p>沒有大總統　愛沙尼亞雖是一個民主共和國，但是不像別的民主國　樣，有大總統　國家的大權操在國會。由國務大臣管理行政，國民是律小等的，沒有什麽爵位階級的分別。</p>
<p>三百年的大學　愛沙尼亞的敎育是很發達的。全國有一千三百多個小學，八十個中學，一個大學。這大學是在塔屠地方，裏而有四千多學生，從二六三二年開設到現在，已經有三百多年的歷史了。</p>
<h3>十分鐘的科學敎學做</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>光的神奇</p>
<p>大家都知道，機器是遵守着一定的規律工作的；那些在天空　爍的星，也是遵守着一定的規律，運行着的。那末，像光這樣神秘西，是不是也遵守着一定的規律呢？</p>
<p>我可以立刻回答你，它也是遵守着一定規律的。比方那些有照相機的人，大家都知道選擇光綫，對準鏡頭，用適當的時間把鏡頭開放，讓光綫進去。於是「察」的一下，一張照片便拍成功了。這種照片是怎麽來的呢？神秘的事情，就在那個鏡頭了。</p>
<p>照相機上的鏡頭，是用一片圓的玻璃做的。我們把這種玻璃片叫做透鏡。造成像的，就是這種透鏡了。原來，當物體上的光綫，走入透鏡之後，便彎曲過來，在透鏡後面的一塊照相板上，聚成一個像。所以照相機的好壊，完全要看上面的透鏡好不好？</p>
<p>普通用的擴大鏡，也可以用來造像。如果你一手拿着這種擴大鏡對住門外的風景，一手拿張白紙放在鏡後，就可以在白紙上看到一張美麗的風景畫。它的道理，完全和照相機相同。</p>
<p>有了這片擴大鏡，可以玩許多把戲。如果你沒有，可以用兩片錶上的玻璃蓋，合起來，中間放滿水，也就成了一片透鏡了。你可以拿它來玩許多有趣的把戲。</p>
<h3>第一圖</h3>
<p>在夜晚點起燭來，可能像圖上那樣，造成一個很好的倒像。</p>
<p>例如把這片透鏡拿到太陽光下去，使太陽光穿過透鏡之后，聚成一片極小的白點。如果拿一張紙到這個小白點上去，就會然燒起來。平常所用的（火鏡），就是這種透鏡。</p>
<p>光綫從空氣裏走入透鏡之后，會起曲折。就是它從空氣裏走入水中之后，也會起曲折。你們總看到過吧：如果有一根棍子，一半放在水裏，另一半露在空中，那根棍子在水面上好像變彎曲了似的。你可以打半杯水，放一枝筆在裏面試試。</p>
<p>還有一個常玩的把戲，也是應用光綫起曲折的道理做的。拿一枚銅元或銀角放在碗裏，一直向後退，退到看不見碗中銅元爲止。於是，叫另外一個人，倒點水在碗裏，立刻銅元就看得見了。</p>
<h3>（第二圖）</h3>
<p>用兩片錶上的玻璃，可以做隻擴大鏡來玩玩。</p>
<p>上面這些把戲，吿訴我們，光綫從空氣裏走入玻璃或水，都要起曲折，彎曲過來。所以光綫也是遵守着一定的規律的。</p>
<p>兒童園地</p>
<h3>一天的早晨</h3>
<p>— 李小岑</p>
<p>紅紅的太陽光，照耀在玻璃窗上，發出顯明的光彩來。啊！時候不早了，我急忙從床上穿起衣服來，便向着外面走去。耳中只聽見一種婉轉的歌兒。抬頭一看，唔！原來是樹上的小鳥們在唱着。這時，可愛的太陽，已高掛在天空，細細的和風，吹在我的面上，引起了我遊賞的興趣。於是便同着姊妹們出外遊玩。在路上只見嫩綠的楊柳，在風中飄揚着，好似對我們鞠躬的樣子。鮮紅的桃花怒放着。靑翠的芳草，碧油油的流水，活潑潑的小鳥，使我的心中特別的愉快。一會，我們到了一個池塘邊，便坐下來談了一回故事。不一會，我們又向前進行到了一個寂寞無人的地方，花草樹木都沒有，簡直好像是一片荒凉世界。我們覺得很沒趣，便循着原路回家。這時太陽已經升得很高，差不爭是正午的時候了。</p>
<h3>化學的花園</h3>
<p>— 蓉</p>
<p>花園是我們歡喜去的地方，但是可惜它在戶外，我們不能把它搬進屋子裏來，小朋友們，這一點你們不是感到缺點嗎？但是不要緊，我現在有一個簡易的方法，只要一個晚上的過去，你的臥室或是書房裏，叫它生出一個花園來，什麽花園？是一個化學的花園。</p>
<p>你預備好一隻吃茶的玻璃杯，最好是白色的。再到藥房去買一些水玻璃，和結晶體的硫酸銅，硫酸鎳，硫酸鋅，硝酸鈷，製造花園的東西，就只這幾樣。</p>
<p>你先把水玻璃溶在水裏，然後將上面所說的各種結晶體打碎成米粒左右大小，把它們雜亂丢人杯子裏，不必太多，這樣，花園的製造便成功了，第二天早上，你起身的時候，一定可以在杯子裹面，見有高聳的樹，如茵的綠草，紅色黃色的花，有靑苔罩著的假山石，……總之，是一個很精緻的花園了。</p>
<p>假使你不振動杯子，這個花園可保存得很久很久。</p>
<h3>我將來做怎樣的人？</h3>
<p>— 青島市立台西鎭小學校史起江</p>
<p>（第十六名）</p>
<p>諸君：我正在兒童時代，也可說是黃余時代，正是求學的好時機。在這寳貴光陰之下，要努力求些學議，那麽有了充分的智識和經騐，鍜錬成鋼鐵般的身體，將來在社會上，才有替國家社會服務的能力。</p>
<p>你看我國現在危如累卵，我們現在一般的兒童，耍再不立志援救我們的文明古國，我國前途，就不堪設想了！</p>
<p>朋友：你將來要做怎樣的人；來爲國家出力呢？我的志願，是將來在社會上，爲人民謀福利，盡其所能，來替國家服務，扶助窮苦失學的兒童。因爲我國不識字的人數，佔全國十分之八九，因此一般人對國家觀念淺薄，不知道個人與國家的關係。</p>
<p>我國所盼望的，就是我們現在一般小主人翁，將來我國興亡，全是我們的責任。</p>
<p>我也是一個中國的主人翁，我將來長太成人，要服兵役，去爲國家報仇，爲民族雪恥，收回我國的利權和失地。</p>
<p>總之：我未來的志願，是爲國爲民的，以身許國，有幾分力量，盡幾分義務，能言敢行，不尙本談，要拿定志向，本着救國的精神，去埋頭苦幹，我的希望，將來要成一個盡忠報國的男兒</p>

<h3>「日光浴」運動</h3>
<p>— 熊芷</p>
<p>現今歐美各國的兒童敎育，辦得非常完善。他們課外各種活動，都値得我們效法，譬如日光浴，於兒童健康的關係很大。下面前圖是德國某幼稚園在室外練體操，充分受日光的照射。後圖是英國嬰兒學校四五歲的嬰兒，在日光下畫寢，你看他們多麼快樂有趣。</p>
<h3>義狗傳（十九）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>小南洛把那打鼓的小木偶放在伊的手中，低聲說道：「愛洛，這一個玩意兒，是我在雪中找到的，你收下了吧。親愛的願上帝降福與你。」小愛洛還沒有開口他道謝，他早巳從棚頂上瀉了下來，在黑暗中飛一般的跑去了。</p>
<p>這夜，磨坊中忽地火燒起來。那磨坊的正屋和坊主的住宅，雖沒有燒去，可是外面的屋子和許多稻草都燒燬了，全村的人都很吃驚的跑出來看，救火車從盎凡爾沒命的開來。磨坊主人柯甘士本來是保着險的，沒有損失甚麼，然而他却憤怒極了。說這回起火不是偶然的，定然有人在那裏搗鬼。</p>
<p>小南洛從睡夢中驚醒過來，同着其餘的人趕去救火，柯甘士却怒氣勃勃的把他摔在一旁，大聲叱道·「黃昏時，你曾偷偷摸摸的在這裏溜達，這一回的事，你總該明白的。」</p>
<p>小南洛默然的聽着簡直是呆住了。他想像這樣的話除非開玩笑，吾則决不會輕易說出來的，然而在這樣的時候，怎麽會開玩笑呢？</p>
<p>第二天那磨坊主人柯甘士仍然對鄰人們道樣說，他雖然並不說是小南洛放的火，不過已暗示人家這孩子黃昏時曾在磨坊近邊溜躂着，不知在那裏幹甚麽事，而他可叉爲了不能和小愛洛見面對於柯甘士是大大不滿的。於是全村的人都附和着柯甘士的話，因爲他是村中一位最富的地主，凡是有兒子的人都想娶得小愛洛做媳婦，所以對小南洛便抱着懐疑的態度，往往將冷眼看他，冷言冷語議刺他。</p>
<p>大家當着小南洛的面，不說甚麽露骨的話，但是完全相信柯甘士的暗示，從此以後，小南洛和柏德希每天早上送牛乳到他們家裏去時，再也不像平時那麽笑臉相迎或好言相慰了。只爲他們全是窮苦而沒有智識的人，見村中唯一的富人旣在反對那孩子，他們也就一窩蜂的跟上去了。可憐小南洛處於孤立的地位，再也沒有能力抵抗多數人們的仇視。</p>
<p>柯甘士夫人哭着向伊的丈夫說道：「你對於那孩子太殘酷了，他當然是個誠實而無辜的孩子，即使心中對你不滿，他也决不會做出這種惡事來的」但那柯甘士是一個非常固執的人，要是說出了一句話，就堅持着不肯改變，而他的心中也未始不知道這是自己錯怪人家的。</p>
<p>小南洛很驕傲很忍耐的應付這種不公道待遇，始終不說一句辯白的話，不過他和柏德希在起，而旁邊沒有外人時，未免有些兒憤憤不平罷了。他心中仍在暗暗想道：「只要我，書奪得了錦標，那時他們對於我也許要譽得過意不去吧」。</p>
<p>可是小南洛還是一個不到十六的孩子，一向住在這小小的世界中，自幼兒就被人家優待和讚美的，如今却見這小小的世界中，大家都無綠無故的反對他起來，這確是一件很難堪的事情。允其在這大雪粉飛飢寒交迫的冬季，所能得到的一點光明與暖意，就是在村中人家的火爐旁邊，聽鄰人們說慰問的話。在這寒冬的時很大家似乎都接近而親熱一些，而對於小南洛和柏德希却一天天的疏速而冷淡了。可憐他們倆只能和那小屋中病倒在床上的老祖父厮守在一起。他們的壁爐中是慣常沒有火的，他們的壁櫥中是慣常沒有麵包的。因爲另外有一個人從盎凡爾送牛乳未分給村中的人家，只有三四家接受小南洛所送的半乳了，因此小南洛的那輛綠色小車中重量已减輕了不少，而他身邊的錢袋也連帶的减輕了。</p>

<p>特寫</p>
<h3>魚市塲的平面立體與輪廓</h3>
<p>— 小笙</p>
<p>本月十一日，上海大魚市塲正式開慕了，計到五百餘人。會塲　佈置於大競賣塲中，於辦公處入口前臨時搭禮台，上置各界所贈銀盃，銀盾等紀念禮品甚多。除萬國旗外，塲　內並高懸紗製的紅綠魚燈，式樣玲瓏別緻，頗爲美觀。於十時許行禮如儀後，首由理事長報吿創建經過，繼由各代表分別致詞，末由總經理答辭，在風雨中禮成。攝影茶點後，卽由招待等領導參觀該塲各處。</p>
<p>下層的競賣塲，是一間如同上海一般水泥建築的小菜塲樣式所在，佔地南北長二一一·七呎；東西長七一·二呎。東爲漁船碼頭，北接市塲辦公處。水泥地上嵌有無數小鐵軌，上置小鐵簸箕車四十部，作爲運魚離碼頭之用，鐵軌直通碼頭，小車亦用電氣馬達拖曳。碼頭有三個，共長六百呎，闊二十五呎。建築極堅固，係鐵架三合土上蓋鐵皮。碼頭上備有多數淡水龍頭，係備到埠漁船免費取用。立碼頭上東望，烟波浩森，帆影幢幢，虬江碼頭，東北在望，相距僅六里。碼頭西沿，建有臨時倉庫四所，長四十二呎，高十四呎許，闊二十五呎，備臨時放置魚類以蔽風雨。</p>
<p>經紀人辦事處在競賣塲西，共兩層，底層有辦公室二十七間，每間長四十呎，闊十四呎半。二層另闊爲各漁輪公司營業處，共有辦事室二十五間，衛生厠所設備俱全，並有儲藏室一。競賣時亦於塲中掛牌公布，如普通交易所然。</p>
<p>辦公處之下層，設有小規模之銀行，備借本與漁民者，名爲漁業信託社營業處。另有社員辦公處，大廳，會客室各一間，魚市塲　辦公室五問，儲蓄庫及夫役室，電話室，厠所等各一問，膳堂，傳達室等均備。二層有總辦公室一間，理事室二間，會議室二間，檔案室，小辦公室，監事室，研究室，圖書室，技術室，會客室，陳列室，膳堂，伙食間，厠所等各一間。三層爲職員宿舍，有臥室六問，夫役室，浴室，厠所各一間。四層有大平台一，無綫電室一間，俯視碼頭極淸晰。五層面積狹小，僅長二十五呎見方，爲無錢電員及氣象報吿員之臥室。六層七層與五層大小相同，爲氣象信號台，又稱瞭望台。於夜間裝置强度燈光，作燈塔之用，並可放信號，向漁船吿警。瞭望台高七十八呎。登最高處四望，則市中心區及上海特區，與淞，浦兩江，均星羅棋布，蜿蜒目前。</p>
<p>下至冷藏庫由庫正門入，中爲黝黑深邃之極長甬道，訐有冷藏庫五大間，經理室二問，製冰室一間，冷凍室二間，機器室二間，及處理室數間，共可冷藏魚類一千五百噸。最北端爲製冰處。底層用鋼架劃成水溝，上面蓋厚數寸之木板，分爲數百小塊，每塊的四尺見方。製冰時將鹽精傾入，通入冷氣後，不久卽成冰塊，再以手拉機引出冰塊，運送而出，計每日可出氷五十噸。冷氣機房卽在緊鄰，有五百匹馬力引擎。又因每日需用掙水極多，故設有大自流井，深一千二百尺，水塔卽在冷藏庫外，極其壯偉美觀。全塲佔地四十七畝，建築費的四十萬元，籌備建築費時至二年之久，始告竣工。土地權屬於上海濬浦局，每年須出租金三萬餘元。該地爲該局新塡江心沙所成，舊名周家嘴沙，現名定海島。通陸地楊樹浦各處，建有大橋名定海橋，緊鄰滬江大學校，特區九路公共汽車可直達橘畔。</p>
<p>那天競賣場上有一些陳列品極應重視。第一便是舊式和新式網魚船和漁輪的模型。第二是一些魚類標本模型。有些乾臘了裝在木架上，也栩栩如生；有些用酒精浸在玻璃瓶中，簡直呼之欲出。共計有標本玻瓶百餘件。第三便是用大瓦盆裝着的一些半生不死的魚，蝦，蛤，蚌等類，奇形怪狀，五花八門，煞是好看。</p>
<p>據該塲職員盛君談，凡我國沿海及江湖池沼所產魚類，因上海交通便利，大都散集於此。最近三年來的食魚消費：在數量方面，以廿三年的一百四十餘萬担爲最多，廿四與廿二年决之。至價値方面，因供求關係，價格有漲落，則以廿二年之一千六百八十六萬一千一百九十六元二角四分爲佔第一位。三年來上海人食魚消費共計三百六十三萬六千四百二十二担六十二斤。平均每年爲一百二十一萬二千一百四十担强。價値共計四千零六十二萬七千九百四十一元一角五分，平均每年爲一千三百五十四萬二千六百四十七元强。全市人口照最近公安局調查，的三百六七十萬人，假定食用魚類均係銷售本市，則平均每人每年食魚類三十六斤半，價値三元九角餘，惟此項數字，調查殊難正確。</p>
<p>上述巨額之產品中，約可分為海鮮，河鮮，鹹魚，海味四種。海鮮爲首，其决爲鹹魚，再次爲河鮮，海味最少。海味價格高貴，又非一般人必需食品</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，這麼可略而不談。言海鮮：可別為漁輸漁獲，冰鮮漁船，及冰鮮桶頭三部，就中以冰鮮魚船運來者為最多。其來源為江浙外海之嵊泗列島及長塗等處。種種為大黃魚，小黃魚，帶魚，墨魚，　魚，　魚，猖魚，　，鯊，鰻，鞋底，蛇子，馬餃，花青，銅盆，白果子，金綫魚，橫　，毛常，白頁，紅魚，紅娘，馬類，三肖，綢，牛尾，河豚，圓頭，青郎，魷魚，赤色，八角，鯰，鱘鰉，梅魚，大管，明蝦，梭子蟹，蟶子，蚶蛤等五六十種。銷路以大小黃魚及帶魚，墨魚為最大。</p>
<p>魚為普通民眾佐食之主要品：上海市輸入者，來路為威海衛，煙台，嵊山泗礁，岱山，及日俄，坎拿大等，大都在吳淞鎮上岸。其銷路則本埠較少，轉運至附近各地較多。種類為薩門魚，青峻，　亁，鲞魚，帶魚，　，　　,鱈乾，馬餃，梅魚鲞，蝦乾，黃花魚乾，嚇皮，鳙魚乾，白果子，河豚乾，大類鮝，鰻，闊口等數十種，以薩門，青鲹，　亁，白果子等銷路最廣。</p>
<p>河鮮來路為浙江之湖洲，嘉興，菱湖，江蘇之常熟，崑山，洞庭等處，魚商運銷頗受歡迎。種類為青魚，草魚，鰱，鯽，鰷，镢，鳊，鯉，　魚，鳳尾，鱔，甲魚，銀魚，墨魚，鱭，鰻，鯔，　，蝦，蟹等，銷路以青魚，草魚，鰱，鯽魚為首，價格以　魚為最昂貴。</p>
<p>參觀完畢，大家便坐了市輪渡的新船，在浦江中徜徉而返。</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3>阿比西尼亞並未失敗</h3>
<p>— 王維平</p>
<p>自阿皇出走，阿京被陷，意大利宣布併吞阿國後，有些奴性十足的入就在這樣說，因而有些頭腦簡單的人也在這樣想：弱者畢竟抵抗不過強者，落後的弱小民族耍抵抗先進的帝國主義y只有自取滅亡；不信，請看阿比丙尼亞抗戰的結果！這樣，弱小民族便只有伏伏貼貼地接受帝國主義者的一切進攻和壓迫了，所謂國家獨立，民族解放，便都成為了空談。——這真是糊塗透頂而且危險巳極的見解！</p>
<p>我們說：不錯，單就目前一時的情形看來，阿比亞尼亞在黑衣宰相的毒瓦斯之下是戰敗了。但這戰敗是光榮的，是值得阿國人民及全世界的弱小民族自豪的。阿比西尼亞沒有飛機，沒有坦克車，沒有毒死斯，沒有近代最新的一切殺人利器，在各方面都是非常落後的，但這樣落後的弱小國家翅並不屈服在意帝國主義之下，它實行與侵略者抗戰了半年，在抗戰中還獲得許多次光榮的勝利，打破了慕索里尼一鼓掃平阿國的迷夢，使各壓迫弱小民族的帝國主義者都驚惶失色。這樣，雖然阿國是一時的戰敗了，但它卻是為全世界弱小民族爭了一口氣的。</p>
<p>意大利想耍併吞阿國的心是早就有了的，在東菲的軍事佈置早就是很周密的，即使阿國不抗戰，慕索里尼也決不會放棄或緩行滅阿的計劃。這樣，假使阿國不抗戰，很柔順地把意軍歡迎到阿京去，將阿國的地圖恭敬地呈獻給慕索里尼，伏伏貼貼地做意帝國主]義的奴隸，那才是阿國人民的丟臉，那才是全世界弱小民族的恥辱！</p>
<p>因為阿國的英勇抗戰，到現在為止，慕索里尼征阿戰費已耗去了七八十萬萬里拉，意國的經濟在國聯制裁之下已表現出了極大的危機，這便是意帝國主義侵阿所遭遇到的重大創傷。在這一創傷下，羅馬的威風將會大減，慕索里尼的統治也將會發生雜於維持的困難。但是如果阿國毫不抗戰地臣服在慕索里尼之下，那意大利的侵略力量必然會要更加增張，因而臣服於它下面的阿國也就更不易解放了。這在客觀上便是等於阿國的自殺！</p>
<p>再說，阿國這次的抗戰，巳博得了一世界弱小民族以及一般有正感的人們的同情，已增高了全世界弱小民族反抗的情緒。事實上，自阿國開始抗戰後，除意大利之外，全世界那一個地方的輿論不是對它表同情的？那一個弱小民族不在熱烈地希望它的勝利？在非州，在歐羅巴，在美洲，各處所發生的黑人與意大利人的鬥爭，一般人民憎瑟意大利的各種表观，不是由阿國的抗戰所直接引導出來的嗎？依據這些，我們可以說阿國雖然一時地戰敗了，但它那抗戰的精神還在阿國人民及全世界弱小民族中生長着，這種精神隨時都有可能更偉大的具機的表現出來，衝破意大利和一切帝國主義的壓迫，創造出自由的光明的世界。目前的世界情勢告訴我們，全世界隨時都有發生非常事變的可能，在一種非常事變來臨時，阿國人民和全世界的弱小民族將會更容易的爭得自己的獨立與自由：這是我應該有的自信。</p>
<p>现在，意大利雖已宣布併吞阿此西尼亞，但由於帝國主義者的衝突更行尖銳，國聯尚未放棄制裁，英法等國已表示出了不承認滅亡阿國的態度，各國駐阿京的公使還存在繼續奮鬥，而且阿國還有大部分領土未被奪去，就是阿京等地也還在紛擾中，被估各地的阿人還在不斷的反抗，倘若阿國能利用國際矛盾，繼續抗戰到底，那是很有可能獲得最後勝利的。</p>

<h3>貧農之國</h3>
<p>— 卞達</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞不僅是一個農業國家，而且是貧窮的落後的農業國家。羅馬尼亞資產階級會用盡方法去發展產業，但他的命運依然停留於這不前進的狀態中。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞只有兩個居民達上萬人左右的都市——Bucharest　和Ｋishinev——，而全國產業工人總數也僅二十萬人。從這一點看來，　足證明羅馬尼亞是一個怎樣的國家了。</p>
<p>在戰前，羅馬尼亞是主要麥出口的國家之一。其大宗的麥出口是根原於農民的貧乏，羅馬尼亞的貴族吸收了他們的血汗，大宗的麥是輸出外國去了，而農民自己呢？卻以食玉蜀黍以為生。這種情形一直和現在也還是如此。</p>
<p>百分之六十的農民文盲，同時也決定了羅馬尼亞的生產技術的落伍。他們雖然　有寬闊的天然平原，而收獲區域還是歐洲中的最小者。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的基本重工業，原料也是很缺乏的，煉鐵只有在戰後合併的唐賽兒威尼亞（Tran　ylvanla）區域中才有，然而也有限得很。水力的利用也因醬的缺乏而致阻滯。普通商品工業的發展，其能鼓勵國內市場的購買力，也是小得非常可憐，自然其主因還是由於一般農民大眾太分期的結果。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的經濟發展的阻滯，還有其他種種原因。其在戰時的損失，也為其致命的原因之一。一切油池，在大戰時均為英國有組織的破壞了，——因為當時英國恐德軍進佔羅馬尼亞來利用這個經濟助力，延長戰爭。</p>
<p>其次，羅馬尼亞全境沒有使得的交通綫的聯絡。新合併區域的鐵道，如唐賽兒威尼亞的鐵道都集中於Budapast一年，已可威納（Ｂuhovina）的鐵道，經過波蘭遠於維也納，柏薩稅比亞（Bessa　abia）的鐵路則直至阿德薩和莫斯科，而西部新區則很難與羅馬尼亞的黑海海口取得聯絡。並且無論那一處的鐵路政都辦得很壞，鐵道和車廂的狀況都不行，非得有幾百萬羅幣的新投資，決不能使路政辦有成績的。可是，最近的羅馬尼亞有此國力嗎？</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的資本缺乏，也是不容諱言的事。長期借欵的利率常至百分之三十至四十，僅銀行借欵有政治活動者不在此限。</p>
<p>现在他們以最大的努力嚴禁現欵輸出，金融退落的趨勢才略見平定，其情形如下表：</p>
<p>粒（Lei）價竟跌到牠的全價的四十分之一。而這跌落並不是出於戰時，而見之於戰後，直至一九二七－一九二八年始略見上升。</p>
<p>國內鈔票發行額，也不能加多，其原因是由於缺少生產資本，因為如此，使羅馬尼亞可以發展的生產力均成為不可能了。二一〇〇〇百萬粒的鈔票，其價值不過三千萬鎊，這在有一千八百萬人口的國家，其實還不能算多。</p>
<p>戰後的羅馬尼亞，人口增加了一倍，但其資本的流通則反不及戰前的老羅馬尼亞。</p>
<p>一九二八年秋季國家農民黨執了政權。從此羅馬尼亞的資產想不靠外資之助，獨立掠奪勞工群眾的政策失敗了，他們不能獨力穩定金融，發展生產力，整理散溫的交通制度，他們不能不為美夢的覺醒而投降了。</p>
<p>為認識這一點我們要追憶到戰前的時代。在農業的舊羅馬尼亞，統治者為地主，並無產業資本階級，當時國內唯一的重要產業為榨油，是外國資本家所有的。羅馬尼亞的資產階級僅僅是原始的重利放債人。他們一方面掠奪糊塗的貴族，一方面剝削窮苦的農民，同時他們又與大地主共同統治著國家。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞在戰前與戰後發生了許多重大的變革，其最重要的為：</p>
<p>第一，土地改良後，了大地主階級的經濟優勢，但同時卻也相當地發展了資產階級的另一方面的抬頭。</p>
<p>第二，自從割據了前匈牙利的土地後，羅馬尼亞的資產階級，因為民族的差別，不能完全適用舊羅馬尼亞的農業條件。唐塞兒威尼亞的Magyar資產階級是很工業化的，可代表工業資本的勢力，同時與Budpest及較過的維也納銀行都有相當聯絡，故更可代表較高級的商業資本勢力。</p>
<p>第三，因為舊羅馬尼亞的資產階級企圖控制新合併區域的資產階級，而自己努力靠自己的力量，使自己走上產業資本主義之路。</p>
<p>然而羅馬尼亞到底怎樣排除外力，自力走上工業資本之路呢？主要的自然是建設新的企業，其進行顯著者如次：</p>
<p>新創建的企業可以租借廠地。其機械進口可以不付關稅。初辦時十年內，其將餘生產微稅不及百分之三，以後十年也不過百分之四。主要的如磨坊，制糖業，都有相當進步。</p>
<p>一切生產品讓家庭工業佔有優先權，只要牠的價格較外貨低賤。</p>
<p>對於食物，原料之出口課以極重的稅，這樣不僅對於財政收入頗多功效，并且也因此保護了羅馬尼亞產業的賤原料及賤勞動。并且食物的價格，因出口稅的重稅，得賴人力保持其低賤價值，也同時可頭像勞動力的價值。</p>
<p>加重金製工業品進口的稅率。</p>
<p>為難持產業資本者的利潤的優厚起見竭力的阻礙勞動運動。</p>
<p>然而，這許多由努力所發生的結果到底有多少成效呢？這是給我們的一個很大的疑問。他們的產業誠然有了相當的發展了，但根本上並沒有將其農業國的特質轉變過來。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞對於土地問題也曾一度做過改良工作的。但因沒有堅決地執行這個政策，因此只有一部分人民得到分配。照土地改良率，有二九一五〇〇〇人註冊可以得到土地的，可是事實上只有一一五〇〇〇〇人分配到手，這樣看來，註冊者中只有百分之三十才實際得到了土地，而且在分配土地的時候，教士，教師，兵士們往往得到較農民優先的地位。而且，假令政府確依了土地改良律分配土地於農民，但其面積也終於太小了，所分得的也實不足以維持生活。有三百萬人所有的土地，每人都不滿五畝，其平均所得數僅一畝四分，五畝地的收穫無論如何不足以維持一個農家的生活的。</p>
<p>大莊田制度沒有消減，百分之二十以上的土地仍在少數大地主與農業企業者的大莊田制度之下，同時大批的農業工人也依然寄生於大地主的壓力之下。</p>

<h3>一個人和一個蚊子</h3>
<p>— 思凡譯</p>
<p>我不知道，我倆是誰先上了車，真個的，我好些時候一點也不知道車廂裏面有他。這客車是從倫敦到一個內地小市針上最末次的一班車——是班慢車，站站都要停的，遲慢得令人明白了什麼呌「永遠」。剛開的時候，裏面還算坐滿了人的，可是開到近郊的一個車站時，旅客們便一個兩個地下去了好些，等到我們離開倫敦所屬的最後一圈地方時，便衹剩下我一個人－或則，我衹知道是我一個人了。</p>
<p>坐在震匝有聲的夜車裏，要是衹有自己一人，便生出一種自由的美感，這是一種很合人意的自由自在，你願意做什麼事都行。你可以自己和自己說話，願意多高聲就多高聲，誰也聽你不見。你可以和張三李四辯論，把他說得讚到泥沙中打滾去，反正不怕有什麼反駁。你可以倒豎蜻蜓玩，誰也不來笑話你。你可以唱歌，或則跳狐步舞，或則練習一種打高爾夫球的姿勢。你可以隨便啟閉窗戶，也不致惹人反對。你可以把兩邊的窗戶都開開或是關上。實在的你可以把牠們開來開去圓舞曲的自由。你隨便上那一個角落上坐坐都行，也可以把牠們輪流著都坐過來。你可以舒舒服服地躺在椅墊上享受那種毫無顧忌的福。</p>
<p>那天晚上我可沒有做這些事情。我偶然不巧地沒有想起它們來。我所做的事要比較的平常得多。當最後一位旅客去了之後，我把我的週刊放下，伸伸胳膊又伸伸腿，站起來從窗戶中看那寂靜的，我現在正在其中經過的夏夜，又注意那白日的余光還在那北天隱約地閃耀；從車的這一邊走過那一邊，倚著那個窗戶又看看；點著一支煙捲，坐下，又讀週刊。到這時侯我才發覺了我的旅伴，他來了站在我牌子上。原來他正是一個有翅膀，說嘴的，有膽量的小蟲，我們普通都呌叫蚊子。我把他從我的牌子上趕走，他在車廂裏四處旋轉了一遍，測量了牠的縱橫高，那一個窗戶上都飛到了，在燈光下左右環繞了一圈，決定了這屋子裏還是那屋角上那個大動物比別的什麼都有趣，又來在我的頸部窺視一下。</p>
<p>我又舉手一揮。他避過了我的手，在車廂內又遊散一周，回來，老實不客氣地坐在我的手背上。這可夠了，我說：大度寬容也有限度的。我已經兩次警告你，我是個特別的東西，我們可投的　　，是深恨不相識者無端亂刺，刺得人怪癢癢的。我好像帶上烏紗帽了。我宣告你死刑，公理須要這樣辦，法庭也允許這樣辦。你的罪案多啦。你是個無賴；你是個擾亂公共安全的；你坐車不買車票；你吃肉沒股份券，為了這些以及還有好些罪惡你就得死。我抬起右手又快又重的拍的一掌。他偏有心呌我露臉，又輕巧又俏皮的一下就閃躲過了。這一下可惹上我的脾氣來。我用手，用週刊，滿處撲他；我跳到坐位上繞著燈追他；我採用了巧貓般的戰術，靜靜地等他下來，驚人地偷偷接近他，迅速無比地襲擊他。</p>
<p>可是這些方法都沒用。他炫耀地公然地和我開玩笑，正像一個精巧的鬥牛者用他的妙計戲弄一只狂怒的壯牛。顯然的他是借此自娛，他完全為了自娛才擾亂我的安靜。他要玩個把戲，你說什麼把戲再比讓這個又大又笨，滋味又好，又無能，又無法想的動物追著滿處跑還好呢？我由此漸漸地想到他的精靈上去，不當他是一個小蟲了，他漸漸地發展出一個人格來，他也和我一般的具有智慧，要在這車廂中和我互爭雄長，我覺得我的心漸漸地對他發生好感，同時自高自大的心便壓下去了。明明剛才的比賽是他勝過我，我又怎能自負高出於他？為什麼不再大度寬容呢？大度和慈悲是人類最高貴的品質。衹有應用這兩種美德，我　能夠恢復我的威望。在目下我是一個可笑的人物，逗人樂的，供人笑柄的東西，作為慈悲解釋我方得重整道德上的尊嚴，光光榮榮地回到我的角落上去。我撤銷了死刑的宣判罷，我說著回來坐下。我殺不了你，可是我赦得了你。我赦你。</p>
<p>我拿起週刊，他偏飛來站在上面。傻先生，我說，你把你自己的小命交到我手中來了。我只要把這本可尊貴的週刊從兩面一合，你便立刻是個死尸了，正在「和平陷阱」和「大胖子先生的謙讓」兩篇文章中變做夾肉包子了。但是，我可不肯那樣做。我已經赦了你，便要呌你心服這個大動物說出一句話來是算一句話的。再說，我也不再想殺你了。因為多了幾分了解你，我不覺得就對你有一種感情了。我心想法郎西士犬師或者稱過你「小兄弟」，我固然不能做到基督教中那種博愛和禮貌，可是我認識了一</p>

<h3>名譽心</h3>
<p>— 虛我</p>
<p>我自小就聽得敎我們的敎員說，西人是把名譽當作第二生命看待的，這似乎是說歐美人士特別注重個人的名譽。其實重視名譽並不只是歐美人，我們中國人也一樣重視自己的名譽。</p>
<p>一般說來，所謂重視名譽並不是和個人的利益沒有關係的，無論在客觀上或在流俗的認識上，我們都不能把名譽心和個人的利己主義分開，講求名譽並不算是被純粹的道德的觀點所支配的，也往往是爲實利觀念所支配，所以顧名譽不能說就是純道德的行爲。因爲每一個人如果他在顧慮損壊他的名譽時，如果他在企圖獲得一個好名聲時，那他就常會聯想到他自己被人崇拜，贊許，尊敬等等。這就是說他是以自己的利益爲出發點，求名正足以抬高自已的社會地位，正足以使自己超出人羣之上而受着別人的拱衛興奉戴，是對於他有利益的。不僅如此，我們中國說得有這樣的一句話，叫慢名利雙全」，這句話就明明吿訴我們名不能和利分開，有名的人就可以得利，而有利的人也往往就可以得名。假使我們把道些話拿來和社會的現實事象相比，客觀上也的確如此。正如蘇秦的嫂嫂說他的話鄕搽，「季子位尊而多金。道一套邏輯公式是非常顯明的，有名即可以有位，位尊就可以多余，所以名中就包含得有利，名至利也歸了。中國舊日求名的方法和途徑唯一的是陝書，所以讀書人的目的就在求功名，所謂「十年寒窗無人問，一舉成名天下知」，也正是在說明讀書求名的過程。至於書中自有黃金屋「書中自有顏如玉」的話，那更是在說明出讀書卽可以成名，由成名即可得財得利甚至得嬌妻美妾的過程了。所以說求名就是求利這話並不是不科學的。反之，有利的人也大半可以有名，在鄕村裏有錢的人常常就是那地方上最有名的人，上任的官吏，過往的員生都得去拜會他，據說這是慕名而往的。在城市裹凡是有千百萬家財的人，一樣必然是那一城市的最有名的紅人。因爲他有財有名，所以一切政治的和社會的設施也得就商於他。特別是近代的選舉制度更表現得明顯，當選人本來要是地方上的素負盛名和威望隆重的人，可是近代的選舉法規定得有財產限制，這似乎是說有錢的人就是素負盛名和威望隆重的人。至於選舉的結果，也大部分是有錢有勢的人當選，這同樣吿訴我們，那些選舉區中有名的人和爲一般選民所景仰誇譽的人正是那些有財產的人。由此可知名和利常是合一的，講求名譽並不出於純然的道德觀念，而是有或多或少的個人的實利主義包含於其中的。</p>
<p>更進一層說，所謂名譽與不名譽，也和善與惡的觀念一樣，並不是有絕對不變的標準的。有許多事情，在這一社會羣的人看來是名譽的，若換上一個社會觀點又是不名譽的。比如說當歐洲第一决大戰中，參戰國的許多有名的將軍，在那些國家中的上層社會的人和愛國主義者看來，是有無上的榮譽的，但在下層社會的人看來，他們不過都是爲了帝國主義的侵略與掠奪而戰，並不是名譽的事。在歐戰中戰死的千百萬兵士，在帝國主義者看來是爲國捐軀，多麽光榮，但在道些死者自身來說，他們不過當了別人的犧牲品，簡直死得很不値得而且可恥。又如米梭里尼侵略阿比西尼亞，在他和帝國主義者看來是很榮譽的，但在一切弱小民族和下層社會看來，則又是一種侵略的野蠻殘酷的可恥的戰爭和行爲。</p>
<p>如此說來，所謂名譽不名譽本身就沒有永久不變的道德標準，因此不一定凡是要名譽就是好的很道德的行爲，不要名譽就完全是壊的　　　　　　。說我們要不、有名譽小道樣提出開　，　不會得着正當　案的　正確的提出問題的方式，　　是說我們　　　不要名譽；應該是說要　樣的名譽；應該具體地說在甚麽立場和怎樣的限度上去講求名譽。名譽心這東西在某種條件　說　好的，是不能不要的，但在某　立場和某「限度之外，則又是壊的，不當要的。如果你絕對地說不顧名譽，那麽一切損人利己卑汚齷齪的事都可以作，「笑駡由他笑駡，好官我自爲之，」明社會是只有混亂，人類只有殘酷野蠻，自相殘殺，這還成個甚麽世界。如果你絕對地說一個人只須注重自己的名譽，於是任何虛榮和好名的事都可以去做，任何可以令自已出風頭的事都可以去幹，那麽結果也會弄得卑汚齷齪，無所不爲。在現社會裏，有許多人就是完全不顧名譽，不顧社會的非難的，完全只站在個人的利益上打算，只要有利於自己，不管大多數人怎樣　我而受害受苦，也不管別人怎樣反對我，我恐行我是地獨往獨來，抱着「寧使我負天下人，不使天下人負我」的奸雄心理，把社會和別人作爲自己的利益的犧牲品，這是很普遍的現象。另有一部分人，則其個人主義的虛榮心非常的重，一切活動的最終目的，都只是建築在怎樣能使自己出風頭露頭角，使自己名滿天下，有聲有色的觀點上，於是一方面則妒忌別人，惟恐別人比自己高，另一方面則絕不接受別人的正當批評，絕不肯承認自已的絲毫錯誤，以爲這是有損於自己的能力名譽的。甚至在不能由正當途徑出風頭時，便不惜走一切可恥的道路去求飛黃騰達，使社會知道有自已，知道自己是個不凡之人。像這樣的好名之人，不但一樣是個人主義的以個人利益爲前提的虛榮者流，而且終於只有落得一個身敗名裂。像桓溫所說的「不能流芳百世，亦當遺臭萬年」，便是這種個人主義的英雄思想的名譽心最重的代表人物。</p>
<p>戒以為一個人也應該要名譽要名譽，但不是以自己個人的利益爲前提去獵取名譽出風頭。因爲名譽心也是我們的向上的生命的活力之一種，如果一個人完全沒有這種要求，那麽他就會心如死灰，形同槁木地醉生夢死下去，社會上有這樣的人不過是贅瘤。名譽心可以使人具有創造力，推動人努力前進，但是我們必須要以大衆和社會福利爲决定我們的行爲的標準。如果我的行爲是不利於社會和大衆的，那麼縱令可以使我知名，使我聞於世，也不應該去獵取這樣的名譽。如果我的行爲是在社會與大衆利益要求之卞當做的，同時也可以使我出名，則我們亦不必故意避去好名之名而不積極去做。應得之名來則不拒，不應得之名雖可立致，亦不之求，所以我們也得要受名譽心的鼓舞，也要抑制我們過分好名的慾求，這才是求名得名的正道。</p>

<h3>人的壽命</h3>
<p>— 菱</p>
<p>生物學家研究動物老死的原因，學說甚多：有的說其原因是由於血液退化，有的說由於內分泌腺體退化，有的說由於徘洩物中毒。Metchnikoff說：大腸菌產生毒質，入血液，身體細胞就中毒而衰老，衰老的身體細胞爲白血細胞所吞滅，從此有用的細胞漸少，而整個身體遂逐漸趨於老死之途。也有人說細胞特化（Specializatoin）是衰老的原因，因爲人體是由受精卵特化而爲組織，器管，系統等等複雜的個體的，平時全體細胞發生分工和合作的現象，適於生存，但偶有一部分的細胞有一部分受損時，全體便受其害。最甚者如肺，心，腦等偶有一損傷，則生命亦卽隨之死滅。</p>
<p>講實際，今日人壽的平均年齡，比往昔有往下的趨勢。因爲人命的壽夭，據許多名科學家長久的硏究，除與遺傳有莫大的關係外，興生活的關係亦不容輕視。前代的壽命長的，後代的壽命亦多長的，前代的壽命短者，後代的人亦難免夭折，此已成爲確論，無庸再說。至於人命的壽天與生活的關係，科學家也曾用動物作過長久的試騐，有白鼠二，使一鼠作戽水　轉輪工作，另一鼠則並不作此項工作，一動一靜，靜者較動者壽命長一倍，兩者壽命的壽夭，相差之　巨如此。今人勞動思想的機會甚多，猶如戽水轉輪的白鼠，比之從前過樸質安靜生活的祖先，相差奚啻倍屣，則生命的壽夭，由此可不龜而　了。</p>
<p>在現在科學的力量還本解完全保障人體永遠不衰亡之前，因爲人體內「能力」消失的速率加快，我們對於我們的生命似乎眞的陷於非常悲觀的境地里了。然而不！憑今日科學的力量，絕對的永生雖未有些微把握，但醫術的進步，衛生方法的注意，則消極的可使生命不縮短其年齡，積極的尙能延長生命於萬一呢！</p>
<h3>木棉布汽車道</h3>
<p>— 諒</p>
<p>最近美國南部正實行用木棉布來做汽車道，這個消息當然是很新奇的。但首先我們應該明白，這里說的木棉布當然不是我們身上穿的木棉布，而是木棉經過了特別的製造，可以用來做汽車道的一種物品。據說這種用木棉布做成的汽車道對於水分有非常强大的抵抗力，同時汽車在這道上駛起來也特別平穩，大槪比較從來的振動要减少二分之一；只是因木棉布大薄，道路容易爲砂礫等所毀壊，而且以木棉布修道路的費用也較多，不很經濟。</p>
<p>當然，能用木棉布來做汽車道，這也可說是科學的一種進步。但美國的這種辦法並非由於科學進步，而是經濟恐慌的結果，更具體說，卽是因爲近來美國棉花牛產過剩，失業問題在實際上仍很嚴重，所以才設法用木棉布來做汽車道，以消費過剩的棉花，以安挿失業工人。事實上，美國現在各處都在紛紛設立汽車道用的木棉布工塲，以表現他們的「景氣」。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Disrupt Customs Anti-Smuggling Efforts, Foreign Ministry Issues Protest Note, Five Protests Since Last Autumn, Tax Revenue Losses Reach Over 30 Million</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Due to Japan's connivance with Japanese nationals in smuggling in Hebei and other areas, and its interference with our country's customs anti-smuggling efforts, the Foreign Ministry has lodged as many as five protests with the Japanese Embassy in China since September of last year. The Japanese side's response to our country's first protest used the Tanggu Truce as a pretext. After our Foreign Ministry refuted it forcefully with reason, there has been no response to date. On the 15th, the Foreign Ministry again issued a note to the Japanese Embassy based on various facts, lodging a serious protest. The original text of the note is as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the destruction of customs anti-smuggling work by Japanese troops in Qinhuangdao and the sheltering of Japanese and Korean smugglers, the Ministry has protested repeatedly in notes, but no reply has been received. It is the inherent right of Chinese customs to maintain the integrity of national taxes by taking appropriate measures to investigate and suppress tax evasion, and no interference from any party is permitted. The Tanggu Truce does not contain any clauses involving armed vessels, and under any interpretation, it absolutely cannot restrict the anti-smuggling work of all Chinese customs' land and sea armed forces. These points have been clearly explained in previous notes, and a sincere request was made to effectively restrain the illegal interference of Japanese troops. This demand is to safeguard China's sovereignty and protect the legitimate interests of Chinese and foreign merchants. However, your side has consistently ignored this, watching as smugglers become increasingly rampant, causing significant harm to China's taxes. The Ministry has received reports that in recent months, due to Japanese interference, customs control has become ineffective at sea. Japanese and Korean smugglers have employed numerous civilian ships and steamers to engage in large-scale smuggling. Even ships with a tonnage of 500 tons are engaged in smuggling. The coast from Lutai to Qinhuangdao has now become a gathering area for smuggling vessels. Once smuggled goods are landed, they can be transported at will without fear of inspection. Some are even transported south by various railways and sold in various places. As for land routes, smuggled goods are transported from Qinhuangdao via the Beining Railway to Tianjin and various inland areas, and those transported south via the Jinpu Railway are also extremely prevalent. Japanese and Korean smugglers in Shanhaiguan and other places carry weapons. If customs officers question them or detain their smuggled goods, the smugglers immediately attack in groups, or stab with weapons, forcibly taking away the goods, resulting in customs officers being seriously injured from time to time. Their rampant lawlessness is truly shocking. From August of last year to April of this year, Chinese customs revenue losses due to smuggling by Japanese and Koreans totaled more than 25 million yuan. Since April of this year, the import of smuggled goods has increased dramatically. In just one month, customs revenue losses have reached a staggering 8 million yuan. The severity of the situation and the shocking figures are unprecedented in the history of customs. Not only are Chinese and foreign merchants deeply indignant, but even enlightened people and legitimate businessmen in your country are deeply concerned and regard it as a major problem. If this kind of illegal situation is not stopped immediately, smuggled goods will inevitably increase daily, and customs duties will decrease. Nothing could be more destructive to China's finances and infringement of China's sovereignty. The Chinese government cannot but recognize this as a serious problem facing it, which requires Japan's immediate reflection. We hereby lodge another serious protest and request your chargé d'affaires to immediately telegraph your government to strictly warn the Japanese troops stationed in Qinhuangdao and other places not to interfere with customs anti-smuggling efforts or harbor smuggling activities. At the same time, smuggling groups, such as the Ishikawashou Transportation Company and other organizations mentioned in the previous note, should be disbanded immediately, and effective measures should be taken to crack down on Japanese and Korean smugglers in Qinhuangdao, Shanhaiguan and other places, so as to restore friendly relations between our countries. This note is hereby issued in accordance with the above. Please investigate and handle the matter accordingly and reply as soon as possible. This is the purpose of this note." (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Smuggling in North China is expanding further. Recently, the relevant authorities drafted a plan, which was submitted and passed at last week's Executive Yuan meeting, to protest to the Japanese government, demanding that it stop interfering with customs anti-smuggling efforts and crack down on the illegal activities of Japanese and Koreans. Regarding the part to curb anti-smuggling, recently four people were sent by the Shanghai Office of the Inspector General of Customs to Beijing to cooperate with personnel from the Customs Administration and representatives from the Ministry of Railways to exchange ideas for several days, studying methods for the Customs and the Railway to cooperate in strictly suppressing smuggling. According to this method, customs officers will be stationed at the stations to inspect goods. If there are no customs documents, all goods will be detained. They also study how to avoid disturbing the passengers' peace, and not hinder the Railway Bureau's business. After three days of meetings, there have been results, which will be sent by the Ministry of Finance to all customs offices for implementation, (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The issue of smuggling in North China has attracted international attention. Consuls from various countries, including Britain and the United States, stationed in Tianjin, are investigating the smuggling situation with Tianjin Customs and reporting it to their respective governments for reference. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Measures to combat smuggling in North China are currently being implemented separately by relevant departments. It is heard that the content of the measures consists of seven items. In addition to stipulating the establishment of additional inspection agencies at important coastal checkpoints to strengthen anti-smuggling forces, personnel will also be sent to conduct secret inspections at stations, wharves, and on vehicles and ships at any time. When encountering imported goods, they must be allowed to pass only upon verification of tax payment documents; otherwise, all will be confiscated and turned over to the government. In addition, all personnel involved in the seizure of smuggled goods will be rewarded generously in accordance with regulations to encourage them, unite the whole country to assist the government in combating smuggling, curb the rampant trend of smuggling, and seek the common security of legitimate businesses at home and abroad. After the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Railways and other departments have discussed the implementation of anti-smuggling measures for days, all ancillary issues have been resolved. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Smuggling by ruffians in Guangzhou is gradually spreading, and merchants in the surrounding countryside are requesting the government to strictly crack down on it. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The seven new anti-smuggling laws promulgated by the Ministry of Finance have not yet been received by Tianjin Customs. Customs is only exercising its powers to the extent possible. Lin Shize has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to report on the anti-smuggling situation, and the date of his trip to Beijing has not yet been determined. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 16th, Tianjin Customs seized three civilian smuggling boats loaded with 800 bags of sugar in the Xihe River west of the Dahong Bridge in the city. They intended to transport it to Shengfang Town for sale. They were immediately intercepted and detained. Recently, more and more smuggled goods have been transported out of Wuhe, and customs officers are working day and night to combat smuggling and prevent exports. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Jinpu Railway has banned the transport of rayon, and other untaxed goods are also refused transport. Therefore, the smuggled goods that come in a steady stream every day feel quite sluggish. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to the impact of smuggling, several trade associations in Tianjin have been harmed and show signs of collapse. They plan to hold a meeting next week to decide on a solution and request the authorities to promulgate effective policies. Moreover, various unscrupulous merchants, greedy for profit, openly sell smuggled goods at the instigation of Japanese ruffians, refusing customs inspections. The Chinese district has almost become a tax-free market. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei-Chahar Political Council has decided to abolish the inspection office from the 15th because the inspection boats of the Qikou Customs are strictly enforcing anti-smuggling measures, and there is no need to set up an inspection office. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the sales of rayon and sugar by Japanese ruffians are too sluggish, and there is a large stockpile in Tianjin, they have recently switched to importing oil, gasoline, cloth, paper, and printing supplies. Since the 14th, an average of about 400 to 700 pieces have been transported in every day. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin Customs announced that merchants who purchase goods confiscated by customs, if they want to transport them to other ports or inland areas in the country for sale, should submit an application at the time of purchase, indicating the place and date of transport and sale, and obtain a transit permit. After the goods arrive at the destination, they must be submitted to customs for cancellation. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Brigade Headquarters Established in Peiping, Kawabe Arrives in Peiping from Tianjin Yesterday, Armed Japanese Troops Move from Kaiping to Tongxian, Tashiro Departs for China Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The commander of the brigade of the 5th Division of the Japanese Army, Major General Kawabe, who was newly added to Peiping, met with Tada Hayao and others in Tianjin and arrived in Peiping this afternoon. About three to four hundred people, including Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Imai, Counselor Shimizu, and Japanese students, welcomed him at the station. More than 300 soldiers from the Peiping Garrison, fully armed, waited at the East Station. After Kawabe got off the train, he inspected the troops at the station and then went to the Japanese Embassy to rest. The Brigade Headquarters was established today and began its work. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Major General Kawabe arrived here from Tianjin today to take up the post of commander of the Peiping Garrison. It is heard that Kawabe is not the commander of the embassy guard, and his position is actually higher than that, as he can command all Japanese soldiers in the Peiping area, including Tongzhou. Peiping is gradually showing a Japanese atmosphere. Japanese soldiers can be seen everywhere, and the number of Japanese civilians, both men and women, coming and going on the roads is truly numerous. Many new Japanese beer bars, dance halls, and restaurants have opened in various parts of the city, and most of the patrons are Japanese expatriates. Chinese and Westerners rarely visit. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) One hundred and fifty new Japanese garrison soldiers arrived in Peiping yesterday. Another 150 arrived here from Tianjin at 5:00 this morning. After resting for an hour, they went to Tongzhou, where they will be stationed for a long time. The commander of the Peiping Garrison will arrive in Peiping today to take office. At the same time, new barracks are being built in the Japanese Embassy compound to house the newly added guards. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Improving education and raising teacher qualifications is a major matter related to the rise and fall of the country.</p>
<p>This conference lasted four days. Everyone had a detailed discussion on the main points of local administration, and everyone had a detailed report on the working conditions of each person, so that the central government had a deeper understanding of everyone's work situation, and in the future it will be able to receive the effect of pointing fingers. After the meeting, everyone's suggestions and reports can be sorted out separately as an important reference for improving local administration. All the discussed cases will be notified separately after the verification method. During the closing period today, it will not be repeated. Now after everyone is dismissed, you must return to your job and serve. Today, I will specifically tell you about the ways and methods that everyone should work hard in the future, and the main points that I think should be improved or paid attention to after hearing everyone's work report this time. The first thing that should be brought up to you is that we must actually promote all politics in the future. We must truly seek methods to supervise, promote, and work hard, and then we can receive double the effect. This is our main task. The program can be divided into the following items:</p>
<p>First, strict examinations. We require the rapid advancement of politics and the certainty of results. Whether it is the head of the provincial government, the director, the subordinates, or the commissioners, the counties in the jurisdiction, and the general supervisors, must be moved to examine and verify on the ground. The main methods for examining civil servants are nothing more than the following: (A) Appointing commissioners must assign specific tasks to specific personnel and limit the procedures and deadlines as a standard for evaluation. (B) Periodic examinations. Regarding the work undertaken by personnel at all levels, a deadline is set, either once every half a month or once a month, to examine their progress and determine their merits and demerits, to supervise and correct them, and to immediately implement rewards and punishments. (C) Evaluation of work performance at any time. In addition to periodic examinations, individual matters must also be evaluated one by one to see if the work is indeed rapid and meets the requirements. (D) On-site inspection. Reports from subordinates should not be based solely on written documents, but must be actually reviewed and personally verified to ensure the effectiveness. If there are any inaccuracies, failures, or incompleteness, they must be admonished during visits and surveys. In particular, county magistrates and district chiefs must be examined at any time, and rewards and punishments should be appropriate. Before the provincial chairman appoints the county magistrate, he must personally meet and examine him at least once. In addition to his spirit and physique, he should also pay attention to the uprightness of his facial features, his generous attitude, and the orderliness of his speech. That is, the county magistrate should pay attention to the selection and training of Baojia heads, in addition to rewards and punishments. Administrative officials must do everything well and get good results. There is no other special skill, only whether they can be trusted to reward and punish. To achieve trust in rewards and punishments, it is especially necessary to comprehensively assess the reality and reputation, so the evaluation must be based on facts. Regarding this point, I hope to study more books such as the Biography of Zhang Juzheng, and the Biography of Guanzi and Zichan.</p>
<p>Second, comprehensively verify the facts. Comprehensively verifying the facts can correct the accumulated malpractices of hypocrisy, perfunctoriness, and delay. The main programs are the following points: (A) Clear system. A clear system that is clear up and down, vertical and horizontal must be established so that there are certain guidelines for handling affairs, certain procedures for examination, and then the responsibility is clear and cannot be shirked. (B) Public selection. To select appropriate talents so that they can be competent and perform their duties. Not only should the selection be absolutely impartial and selfless, but also practical achievements and abilities should be emphasized, and do not stick to qualifications. (C) Specific responsibility. After selecting and appointing, it is necessary to grant power to allow them to expand as much as possible, and also guide them in case of incidents so that they can achieve achievements. (D) Long tenure. Superiors are sincere in their trust, and their subordinates can give full play to their strengths and strive to achieve success. Therefore, after taking office, if the personnel are appropriate, they should not be transferred too frequently, and must be in office for a long time. (E) Strict assessment. The work assigned must be assessed in detail to avoid omissions. (F) A reward and punishment. Trust in rewards and punishments must be based on certain standards, and cannot be thick on one side and thin on the other, with a slight difference. (G) Inspection and reporting. The reports submitted by subordinates must be based on facts, examined, verified, and clearly defined merits and demerits, and evaluated at any time. (H) Face-to-face awards for honest and competent subordinates must be rewarded in person to stimulate their desire to move upward and achieve the effect of thoroughness from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Third, close contact. In all our administrative work, the most taboo is scattered divisions, each acting as its own government. In this way, not only is the strength dispersed, but it often hinders the work of other parts, and it is impossible to achieve the overall effect. In terms of matters, whether it is civil affairs, education, construction, or public security, each item is related to each other, and they share weal and woe. In the future, we must take the spirit of cooperation and unity and further achieve close ties. In terms of region, adjacent areas are particularly closely related, and should cooperate more closely. Therefore, each administrative inspectorate commissioner should effectively contact the commissioners of neighboring regions or provinces. Political work related to neighboring regions or provinces must eliminate boundaries, regardless of borders, and work together to carry out consistently. The same should be true between provinces. As for each province and region, they should also visit and learn from each other. When they hear that a certain work is being done most effectively in a certain province or region, each director and commissioner should personally visit, investigate, and study. Such mutual learning and common improvement will surely receive great results. Not only should it be like this for neighboring provinces and regions, but also under possible circumstances in the work, they can also go abroad for on-site inspections to increase their knowledge and experience in handling affairs. In short, in order to increase efficiency, mutual contact and avoidance of duplication and conflict are necessary. Recently, I have often heard lower-level agencies say that the command system is complex and ununified. In fact, this is not only a matter of regulations and systems. Regulations and systems should be improved at any time, and personnel who handle official documents in terms of personnel can be well trained to make their understanding clear and thorough, and the handling procedures will not be wrong. The supervisor can pay more attention to the functions and mutual relations of the agency, and there will be no duplication and confusion. More cooperation is needed to run through it, and the disadvantages of differences and conflicts will not occur.</p>
<p>Fourth, politics and education are integrated. Now, no matter what we do, we always feel that the manpower is insufficient. The way to remedy this is to pay attention to talents first, and to change the atmosphere second. Therefore, whether it is the administrative officer of the province, county, or district, it must make the faculty and staff of the large, middle, and primary schools in the area and the personnel of the administrative organs into one, not only can talents be taken locally to assist the promotion of politics, but also the reform of society, the revitalization of people's hearts, and the establishment of the atmosphere. It must also take political education cooperation as the key. Modern politics is becoming more and more specialized and technical. Common sense alone is not enough to deal with it. We must use experts to help. Although each province cannot hire many specialized technical talents due to financial relations, there must be many experts with research in universities and other places. Even among middle school teachers, if you look closely, there are no lack of specialists. Each province can use the specialized knowledge of these professors to study and plan on administrative matters. On the one hand, the government can receive the effect of experts helping, and at the same time, school professors and others can also use practical problems to verify their usual learning. There is no reason why they would not be happy to contribute. In ancient China, it was the most important duty of local officials to pay attention to talents. We should not only effectively contact the people in the local education community, pay attention to their knowledge, character, and talents, and help them with reason, but also treat the education community with noble character with courtesy and cultivate students and the society and other teachers' atmosphere of respecting morality. The heads of education departments in various places, on the one hand, should be morally upright and consciously be in the position of a teacher in a province, and at the same time, they must focus on cultivating teachers with noble character and enthusiasm for service, and must try to encourage the spirit of the education community to serve and sacrifice for the country and society. In this way, we will surely receive the effect of changing the atmosphere and promoting politics, and we should also pay attention to this for civic training and student training. (Unfinished)</p>

<h3>Cabinet Reorganization in Austria and the Political Situation in Central Europe</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>After a ten-hour meeting late on the 13th, the Austrian cabinet was completely reorganized on the 14th. Schuschnigg remained Prime Minister and concurrently held the powers of Foreign Affairs and National Defense, becoming a de facto and de jure dictator of Austria. Prince Starhemberg, the previous de facto dictator and leader of the Home Guard, was relegated to the political sidelines. This cabinet reorganization in Austria is not only of great significance in domestic politics, but also has a great impact on the future development of the political situation in Central Europe.</p>
<p>We know that since the war, Austria's existence and independence have relied on the maintenance of countries such as Britain and France due to its weak national strength. The League of Nations has borrowed huge sums to transform Austria's financial organization, but since the outbreak of the world economic panic, Britain and France have had no surplus to help Austria. Therefore, the labor of Italian Fascism took the opportunity to invade Austria. After the German National Socialist Party came to power in 1933, it urgently sought to merge Austria, arousing great resentment among the Austrians. Therefore, the pro-Italian tendency became stronger. The governments from Dollfuss to Schuschnigg can be said to be governments under the protection of Italian Fascist forces. All domestic and foreign affairs facilities are only commanded by Rome. For example, the interests of the Fascists conflict with the National Socialist Party's advocacy of German-Austrian unification, so the Austrian government tried its best to suppress the domestic National Socialist Party. Because the Black Shirt Prime Minister was against the Socialist Party, the Austrian government tried its best to destroy the domestic left-leaning forces. The result of Dollfuss's vigorous implementation of this policy was the revolution of the Socialist Party in February 1934 and the coup of the National Socialist Party in June. Tao was killed in the coup. The Schuschnigg cabinet, which succeeded Dollfuss, continued the pro-Italian policy of the previous government.</p>
<p>The most important figure in the pro-Italian forces in Austria is Prince Starhemberg, the leader of the Home Guard. The Home Guard is the armed organization of Austrian Fascisti. Most of the weapons are supplied by Italy, and its power is very great. The reason why the Austrian government was able to suppress the opposition National Socialist Party and the Socialist Party was mostly due to the power of the Home Guard. Therefore, its leader Starhemberg became the de facto dictator in Austrian politics. However, precisely because the power of the Home Guard was too great and its actions were too domineering, it aroused serious opposition. The Catholic Socialist Party, to which Schuschnigg belonged, although also opposed the merger of Germany and Austria and the rise of left-leaning forces, was unwilling for Austrian politics to be completely dominated by Rome. Therefore, it was very opposed to the extremely pro-Italian Starhemberg. Recently, the conflict between the two sides has become more acute. When the Catholic Labor Corps made a spring parade last Sunday, hundreds of Home Guard members insulted them. Later, Starhemberg took the liberty of sending a telegram to Mussolini in the name of "the Austrian people fighting for Fascism" to congratulate him on the success of annexing Abyssinia. All these actions of the Home Guard are not approved by most of the Austrian people. Therefore, Schuschnigg took the opportunity to reorganize the cabinet and exclude Starhemberg from the government when Italy was unable to take care of itself after the East African War. Although there are still three Home Guard members in the new cabinet, its pro-Italian power is not what it used to be.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the reorganization of the Austrian cabinet is a victory for the Catholic Socialist Party over the domineering Home Guard in domestic affairs, so that Austrian politics will not rely too much on Italy in the future, and in international affairs, the loss of power of the Home Guard will greatly weaken Italy's power in Central Europe. However, Austria is still a country that cannot be completely independent, so the conflict of imperialist forces in Central Europe may be intensified by this incident.</p>

<h3>US-Japan Agreement Established: Limiting Exports to the US, Limited to Last Year's Imports</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was claimed by responsible parties today that the United States and Japan have temporarily agreed that the amount of Japanese cotton textiles imported into the United States this year will be limited to around the total amount imported last year. However, officials from the State Department and the Japanese Embassy in the United States are still discussing the details of the agreement. The exact figures will not be known until the final compromise is reached. According to reliable sources, the temporarily agreed agreement stipulates that the import of bleached cloth is limited to about 34 million square yards, and the remaining cotton goods are limited to 6.5 million square yards. It is advisable for fair observers today to say that the above figures, if confirmed, are the most extravagant thing that Japan can hope to obtain in the current environment, especially because the US government is now under pressure from New England congressmen before elections and tax increases.

<h3>Chemistry Lecture Series, Part 2: Applications of Chemistry (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Chen Kezhong, Full-Time Translator, National Compilation and Translation Bureau</p>
<p>Regarding nutritional issues, as the saying goes, "All diseases enter through the mouth," which is quite true. The famous physician Sir William Osler also said that a person's illness, apart from direct infection, is mostly due to the food they eat. Therefore, some say that a complete diet and good food are as important as medicine for treating illness. There are many kinds of food we eat, but the main chemical components are no more than the following five: carbohydrates, fats, proteins, inorganic salts, and vitamins. The human body is like a machine; carbohydrates and fats are the fuel that directly generate kinetic energy; inorganic salts and proteins can be regarded as the materials for repairing and building the body; and vitamins are like lubricating oil for the machine, without which the machine cannot operate. Among these nutritional materials, the chemical reactions of carbohydrates and fats are relatively simple, while the chemical reactions of proteins and vitamins are more complex. Decades ago, chemists thought that the nutritional value of all proteins was the same, but now we know that this is incorrect because proteins are composed of twenty amino acids, and not every protein necessarily has all twenty amino acids. For example, casein in milk and albumin in eggs contain all the amino acids needed by the human body and can allow animals to survive and grow normally on their own. Therefore, these two types of proteins are called complete proteins. Other proteins contain varying amounts of amino acids; some can allow animals to survive on their own but not grow normally, and are called semi-complete proteins, like gliadin in wheat. Some proteins cannot allow animals to survive on their own nor grow normally, and are called incomplete proteins, like zein in corn. Complete proteins are rare, but we can use chemical methods to supplement them. For example, wheat flour is rich in carbohydrates and proteins but lacks fats, so Westerners eat bread with milk, which is a very scientific approach. Northerners in our country often eat wheat flour with soybeans, which is also scientific, because wheat protein lacks several amino acids and is not very good when eaten alone, but these missing amino acids are abundant in soybeans, and soybeans lack some amino acids that wheat has. Ordinary soybean bread is made from one part wheat flour and one part soybeans, and the composition of this bread is the same as that of the French military bread during the European war. According to a survey, several schools in Shandong vigorously promote students to eat soybean buns, and as a result, the students' bodies are growing very well. This proves that eating soybeans and wheat flour together is scientific and worthy of promotion in our country. Speaking of the term vitamin, everyone must be very familiar with it. The discovery of vitamins is only a recent matter of about thirty years. Initially, chemists fed animals artificial pure food and natural food with the same composition, and found that the animals eating pure food did not grow as well as those eating natural food, and thus vitamins were discovered. There are now many known vitamins, but we are currently more clear about vitamins A, B, C, D, and E. Although the content of vitamins in food is very small, their impact on nutrition is very large. For example, if the food we eat lacks vitamin A, we will develop xerophthalmia; if it lacks vitamin B, we will develop beriberi; if it lacks vitamin C, we will develop scurvy; if it lacks vitamin D, it will cause children's bones to develop poorly and lead to rickets; and if it lacks vitamin E, it will result in infertility or the offspring will be born dead. The types of vitamins contained in food vary greatly; some are rich in one type and lack another. Milk is considered to be a food that is very rich in vitamins and relatively complete in all types. Our country is not a milk-drinking country, but the other things we eat, such as eggs, vegetables, and fruits, all contain very rich vitamins. As long as we allocate them properly, we don't have to worry about problems. Mr. Ding Wenjiang once said that during the European war, the Chinese workers who participated in the war were able to dig trenches as well as Westerners because they ate the same things as Westerners. However, the work efficiency of workers in China is much lower than that of foreigners because the food eaten by domestic workers is not nutritious enough. I believe that the reason why soldiers' combat ability is not as good as others, and students' physiques are not as good as others, is also because of insufficient nutrition. Therefore, nutrition is a very important issue, and we should quickly study the nutritional value of our ordinary foods and then, from the results of the research, come up with very economical methods so that everyone can get adequate nutrition. In the past, there were Peking Union Medical College and Shandong Qilu University that engaged in food research in our country. Recently, there are Yenching University in Peking, the College of Agriculture of Peking University, Jinling University in Nanjing, the Institute of Biology of the Science Society of China in Nanjing, and Datong University in Shanghai. We sincerely hope that everyone will work hard to promote this research, and then there will be hope for improving the dietary problems of our country in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the topic of dyes, as mentioned earlier, dyes are very important for clothing, and even people in remote areas need to use dyes, which shows that the use of dyes is very common. But where do dyes come from? To answer this question, we cannot avoid talking about coal.</p>
<p>In addition to being used as fuel, the other important uses of coal are not well noticed by ordinary people. In fact, coal has so many uses, such as explosives, medicines, preservatives, spices, photographic materials, artificial bakelite, dyes, and all organic medicines, all of which come from it. In the past, people who made coal gas and coking coal felt that the black stuff left over in the factory was not only useless but also very annoying and often discarded it casually. This unnecessary waste went unnoticed for almost a hundred years, which is a pity. In the past, people believed that organic compounds contained life force and could not be manufactured by humans. Now, we can not only manufacture them, but also the quality of man-made things is often purer than natural ones; some are more fragrant than roses, some are sweeter than honey, some are more beautiful than rainbows, and there are many man-made products that are not found in nature.</p>
<p>After coal is burned, what remains is only ash. If coal is placed in a device, not in contact with air, and heated and distilled from below, the volatile matter contained in the coal will escape outward, and the mixture of carbon and ash that remains is coke. When the escaping gas cools, a part of it condenses into black oil, which is coal tar, and the remaining gas is washed of nitrogen to become coal gas. For clarity, we now list the various products obtained by distilling one ton of bituminous coal in the following table:</p>
<p>After coal tar is distilled, more than ten kinds of basic dye products can be obtained, from which hundreds of intermediate products can be obtained, which can then be used to make thousands of kinds of dyes. The first artificial dye was invented in 1856 by the Englishman Perkin. When he was fifteen years old, he followed the German chemical master Hoffmann to study chemistry. At that time, Hoffmann was lecturing in England. Perkin was influenced by Hoffmann and wanted to make quinine from coal tar. He oxidized the aniline distilled from coal tar, and the result was not a pure compound but a black precipitate. Ordinary people would definitely think that this was useless and would discard it casually, but Perkin, after detailed research, invented the first coal tar dye, which is now aniline purple. In 1867, the German chemists Graebe and Liebermann invented artificial alizarin. Before they invented this dye, France had 90,000 acres of land planted with madder to extract alizarin from the grass as a red dye. In 1869, Gracbe-Liebermann and Perkin successively obtained patents for the manufacture of alizarin. As a result, no one planted natural madder anymore. The third major dye to be invented was dibromo indigo. Western countries all admire purple because it is a very rare color, so only rich people are qualified to wear purple. There is a saying in our country, "Taking cyan and purple is like picking mustard seeds," and the color purple in ancient China also represented noble officials. This pigment used to be made from the secretions of a purple snail in the Mediterranean, and one ounce could sell for more than 300 US dollars. Later, in 1909, the German chemist Friedlander analyzed this pigment and understood its structure, and then it was made artificially. The fourth important dye to be invented was indigo. The use of indigo originated very early. In ancient Egypt, people used blue cloth to wrap corpses because this blue cloth would not fade for a long time. This dye used to come from plants, and India planted the most of this plant. In 1897, there were one million acres of land in India planted with indigo, producing 8,000 tons worth 20 million US dollars. But after Baeyer spent fourteen years of effort to invent artificial indigo, the production of natural indigo was greatly reduced. In 1914, the total output in India was only worth 200,000 yuan. The company that manufactured artificial indigo was initially the largest, the German Badische Company. This company spent five million yuan and seventeen years of chemical research to be able to hold the reins of indigo dyes worldwide. Its products accounted for almost 96% of the world, but after the European war, other countries worked hard to compete with it, so now Germany cannot monopolize the dye market as it did before. The basic dyes mentioned here all come from coal tar. As discussed above, we can manufacture thousands of dyes from coal tar, and the examples cited here are only a few of them. These dyes all belong to aniline dyes. This type of dye has many colors, the color is very durable, and it can be used for dyeing fabrics such as silk and cotton.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Future Prime Minister of France, Leon Blum: The Socialist Party Does Not Want to Retaliate Against Germany; Domestic and Foreign Peace is Urgently Needed, But Must Be Sought Within the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Paris) Socialist leader Leon Blum said in a speech at the American Club here today that rumors that the French Socialist Party intends to fight National Socialist Germany to retaliate against Germany's mistreatment of French Socialists are completely false. The experiment that we intend to conduct now requires domestic peace and, more importantly, foreign peace. People regard Blum's speech today as his last before taking office as Prime Minister. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The parties belonging to the Popular Front held a grand meeting at the Wagram Hall last night to celebrate the election victory. The Secretary-General of the Orthodox Socialist Party, Fauré, and the leader of the party, Léon Blum, successively delivered speeches. Fauré immediately described the various measures that the party should take to solve the unemployment problem, which was greeted with thunderous applause. Among them, regarding the plan to carry out public works, he briefly stated: "This project is large in scale and encompasses a wide range of areas, such as adding sanatoriums and hospitals, adding civilian housing, eliminating slums, and widely connecting electricity in rural areas, which are all examples. In addition, a 40-hour work week should be implemented. As for the source of funds, it should be taken from national savings. In the past, these savings were often eroded by those who defrauded and took wealth, and in the future, they should be used for the right purposes. If national savings do not help, then capital mobilization should be used to help it. We have sacrificed our lives to defend our country, how can we see that inanimate objects, that is, capital, cannot be forced to make the same sacrifices? If we do this out of necessity, it is enough to become patriotic people, but what is called patriotism is based on humanity." As for the party's foreign policy, it can be summarized in one sentence: "Peace must be sought through the League of Nations." Then, Léon Blum rose to speak, briefly stating, "It is true that French thought is not free from the framework of family economic concepts, but it is also creative, which is something that must be known. In the past, when the late Prime Minister Poincaré was in power, he was able to cater to the concept of family economics, and he was able to win the trust of the middle class and achieve great things. We should appeal to the creative spirit of the people." After he finished speaking, the audience warmly welcomed him. The Wagram Hall was crowded last night, and no less than 10,000 people who could not enter the hall were still listening near the Arc de Triomphe, which was truly a grand occasion.

<p>(London) When the leader of the French Orthodox Socialist Party, Léon Blum, delivered a speech at the American Club in Paris yesterday, he mentioned the issue of negotiating the war debts of various countries to the United States. Political and financial figures were very interested after hearing the news, believing that the British government and British public opinion are willing to see the relations between Britain and the United States become closer, and decided to do everything possible to promote international trade, that is, to find a compromise solution to the US war debt issue in this. It is a pity that the hope of a solution is very slim, and the psychology of people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean must also evolve beforehand before it can be possible. However, political figures are still discussing the various points mentioned by Léon Blum, hoping to bring up the entire war debt issue again. If this is the case, then in the current situation, since it is impossible for the negotiating countries to demand that Germany pay compensation, they must bear the full responsibility for the war debts to the United States themselves, so the United States must take this situation into account and allow the negotiating countries to pay a sum of money, that is, a symbolic final sum, in order to end the war debt issue. In this way, the United States may be interested in the reorganization of the League of Nations, so that the various obligations contained in Article 16 of the Covenant can be limited to regions and implemented regionally, and the joint responsibility borne by all member states is limited to implementing economic sanctions against aggressor countries, which is sufficient.

<h3>Eden Passes Through Paris, Meets with Blum, Cadogan Sees the King</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Eden flew back to London tonight. When he passed through Paris, he met with French Foreign Minister Flandin and future Prime Minister Blum. It is said that their talks were of an informal nature. Flandin has been unwell recently and was unable to attend the League of Nations Council meeting in Geneva. It is reported that Eden and Blum discussed the general state of international affairs in an informal conversation. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden, accompanied by Foreign Office official Lord Cranborne, flew back from Paris and arrived at Croydon Airport at 5:30 PM. According to sources in the Foreign Office, the Foreign Secretary's first task upon returning to the capital will be to study whether the current sanctions should be maintained. On this matter, if it can be clearly demonstrated that Abyssinia's resistance has been eliminated and the sanctions are no longer meaningful, then Britain would be willing to lift them. The general public also believes that the current sanctions should be lifted. However, the Cabinet is currently most concerned with finding a reasonable justification to convince public opinion. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Alexander Cadogan, former Ambassador to China and newly appointed Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, returned to the country several days ago. He was received in audience by King Edward VIII this afternoon, and there was a discussion. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Reorganization and Collective Security System Discussed in British House of Lords, Russian Ambassador Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>(London) Lord Ponsonby, a member of the House of Lords, requested the government to submit a proposal to the League of Nations to revise the collective security system. The House of Lords debated this proposal, which concluded last night. Several people spoke on the issue of whether the League of Nations should focus on mediation and abandon methods of coercion. Lord Peel agreed that the League of Nations should focus on mediation and said that Articles 10 and 16 of the League Covenant risked creating false hopes. If the Covenant were amended, non-member states could be induced to join. Lord Rankeillour said that the British government's policy in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute was justified, but maintaining sanctions merely to uphold principles was useless. The current events were only expedient. Lord Dickinson said that Article 16 of the Covenant should not be easily deleted until a replacement was decided upon. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Stanhope replied that the government would consult with overseas dominions on what changes should be made to Britain's obligations to the League of Nations. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Soviet Russian Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, delivered a speech at a banquet of the Anglo-Russian Parliamentary Committee tonight, saying that "we are willing to strengthen the League of Nations Covenant, strengthen the League of Nations itself, and create collective security in all parts of Europe. The Soviet Union has no objection to the principle of negotiating with Germany, but believes that Hitler's peace plan cannot promote genuine peace in Europe. We believe that before these negotiations begin, all countries concerned with pacifism should agree on a common basis for negotiations with Germany." (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Suvich recently met with British Ambassador Sir Eric Drummond. Prime Minister Mussolini met with the Austrian Minister, and there were discussions, the content of which is unknown. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The Republic of Guatemala in Central America has recently announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations. The Foreign Office does not approve of this action and fears that if the current sanctions against Italy continue to be implemented, then Ecuador and Chile in South America may follow suit and announce their withdrawal from the League. (Note: Since the cessation of hostilities in the Italo-Ethiopian War, Ecuador has automatically revoked the sanctions. Chile sent a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol at the last meeting of the League of Nations Council, advocating the revocation of sanctions. When the Council passed a resolution on the 12th, the Chilean representative abstained from voting.) It is reported that Guatemala is now planning to propose the organization of a "League of American Nations." This proposal has received the sympathy of British people because Britain also advocates amending the League of Nations Covenant so that the implementation of mutual assistance methods is based on a regional system and no longer has a general nature. This is in line with the intention of organizing the "League of American Nations." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 13-nation committee of the League of Nations Council previously requested the Executive Committee of the International Red Cross to provide a copy of its report for reference because Italy and Abyssinia had accused each other of violating the laws of war in their combat methods. This was rejected on the grounds that the Red Cross should strictly maintain neutrality in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Until recently, the Executive Committee learned that both parties to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute had made this request to the League of Nations. The previous reason no longer existed, so it notified League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol that the Committee is now preparing to investigate whether the combat methods adopted by Italy and Abyssinia violate the provisions of the Geneva Convention. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Italy Does Not Believe Abyssinia Has Established a Separate Government</h3>
<p>(Rome) There are rumors that Abyssinian government officials recently organized a provisional government in Gore, southwest of the Abyssinian capital. Semi-official sources here do not believe it and say that the Abyssinian Emperor himself has not mentioned this matter so far, which shows that it is fictitious. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that the Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires in Turkey learned that the Abyssinian Emperor intends to go to Geneva to personally appeal to the League of Nations Council about the destruction of his country by force. People here are surprised because it is unprecedented for a head of state to appeal to the League of Nations. Now everyone is asking each other, "Since the Abyssinian Emperor has fled, whom will he represent?" Some people now feel that the Abyssinian Emperor's flight is self-defeating. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Italian Preparation for Development of Abyssinian Land, Road Building and Colonization Proceeding in Tandem</h3>
<p>(Rome) The government has recently appointed two fascist-affiliated organizations to develop Abyssinia. One is the Industrial Confederation, which should study the development of raw materials. The other is the Agricultural Confederation, which should investigate colonization matters. In addition, a special investigation team has been entrusted to the National Research Institute and the Industrial Confederation. They will go to Abyssinia immediately to conduct general investigations, starting with a population census. The water conservancy in southern Abyssinia must be fully developed, and electricity must be supplied to various rural areas. Then Italian people will be sent to colonize the fertile plateaus, but the rights originally enjoyed by the natives must be respected. Experts believe that the plateau land is suitable for wheat, cotton, coffee, corn, sugar cane, tobacco, hemp, and other items. If the output of cotton can be expanded, Italy will no longer need to import cotton from the United States. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government has now planned to develop Abyssinia. The first step is to build roads on a large scale, divided into seven major trunk lines: The first line runs from the Abyssinian capital to Magale, connecting with the asphalt road from there to Asmara and Massawa in Italian Eritrea. This is the northeast trunk line. The second line runs from the Abyssinian capital to Taeshi in the north, and then turns east, reaching the port of Assab in southern Italian Eritrea. At the same time, the facilities of the port of Assab will be improved. The third line runs from the Abyssinian capital to Gondar in the northwest and then north from that city, reaching the Setit River. This is the northwest trunk line. The fourth line runs west from the Abyssinian capital to Walega. This is the central trunk line, along which there are many platinum and gold mines. The fifth line runs from the Abyssinian capital to the southwest lake region. This is the southwest trunk line. The sixth line runs from Harar to Dire Dawa, connecting with the railway. The seventh line is the southeast trunk line, which will be connected to the road to Italian Somaliland after completion. (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Djibouti: It is heard that Italy has proposed to France that if accepted, the port of Djibouti and the railway from Djibouti to the Abyssinian capital will belong to Italy. Italy is willing to compensate France elsewhere. French people say that although the commerce of the port of Djibouti has been ruined by Italy's occupation of Abyssinia, France will never cede it to other countries because of its military importance.

<h3>German Finance Minister Speaks on Colonial Issues, Needs of All Countries Must Be Met</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Finance Minister Krohsik spoke to an economists' gathering today, saying that the German colonial problem cannot be solved by an open door policy to purchase raw materials. If Germany can purchase some raw materials with its own currency, then the financial problem can be helped. The transformation of the world economy depends on the just resolution of the raw materials distribution problem. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Finance Minister Krohsik recently delivered a speech at the World Economic Society, in which he advocated on the colonial issue, saying: "The special needs of all countries in the world must be met. When the colonial issue is raised for discussion in the future, no one should cite Germany's responsibility for the European War as a reason to obstruct it. The German government's policy on population issues does not mean that after the population increases, the need for various raw materials must also increase. The survival of a nation does not depend solely on various raw materials or foreign currencies. Other issues, such as the colonial issue, are even more important. However, the so-called colonial issue of Germany cannot be resolved by opening the door to the colonies of other countries, and further measures are needed. As for Germany's financial situation, it can only be improved when it can fully purchase various raw materials with its own currency. This is often overlooked by the world." (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>(London) A delegation from the Conservative Party Imperial Affairs Committee of Parliament will use the Committee's proposal to request the government to make a clear declaration so as to avoid the anxiety of the people about the future of British mandated territories. It was submitted to Prime Minister Baldwin, and it is heard that the Prime Minister has scheduled to meet with the delegation on Tuesday. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Deep concern is felt here about Germany's current financial situation. Representatives of various clearing banks affiliated with the Bank of England unanimously agreed at a meeting here on Thursday that Germany's economic situation is very serious. Therefore, all participants have decided not to lend money to Germany anymore. (National News, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, it was rumored that the government secretly notified major banks that a financial panic would occur in Germany again, and that these banks should not lend money to that country. Regarding this matter, our reporter recently inquired with people in the financial community but did not receive confirmation. These people only said that Britain had previously decided not to lend money to the German central government or local municipal governments for political and technical reasons. The situation at this moment is no different from before, and the rumor of lending money cannot become a reality. As for the private sector, only lending to German export goods is another matter.

<h3>Hitler's Guard Mutiny Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign sources have reported that after a part of Hitler's personal guard mutinied, they have been sent to detention camps. Official sources have recently denied this, saying that this kind of rumor is absurd and aims to poison international public opinion. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Naval Negotiations to Proceed in London Next Week</h3>
<p>(London) Russian Ambassador Maisky wrote to the British Foreign Office today, stating that the Soviet Union is willing to open negotiations in order to join the naval agreement recently established in London. It is expected that this discussion can be held in London early next week and that a foundation for an agreement can be established soon, so as to establish a compromise in accordance with the scope set at the London Naval Conference. Since this agreement did not mention the issue of quantitative restrictions, the number of Soviet warships can be determined according to the situation in the Far East and is not affected by this agreement. If Japan and Russia sign a separate agreement, then the Soviet fleet will be restricted. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) As is generally known, Soviet Ambassador Maisky has submitted a note to the Foreign Office, agreeing to immediately conduct naval negotiations with Britain, saying that regarding naval armaments, the Soviet Union is prepared to participate in any quantitative or qualitative restriction measures that are acceptable to Germany, and the Soviet Union will also reserve the right to reject those that are rejected by Germany. Also, the future naval agreement between Britain and Russia should be limited to European waters and have nothing to do with the Far East, because the increase or decrease of Soviet naval armaments in the Far East should be transferred according to the situation of Japanese armaments. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Powerful naval officials here declared today that the Soviet Union's plan to build a large navy in the Baltic Sea and the Far East will cause new changes in the naval and diplomatic fronts of neighboring countries and will affect the naval policy of the United States. Experts here believe that the navies of Germany and Russia are now equal, but if the Russian navy unites with the French Baltic fleet, it can threaten Germany. The rapid increase of Soviet power in the Far East will also stimulate naval competition in Japan. Others welcome the Soviet Union's construction of a large navy in the Far East because this fleet can offset Japan's advantage. However, well-informed sources unanimously believe that the Soviet Union's naval plan will not affect the naval balance at present. Most people here feel that the note sent by the Soviet Union to London is of a diplomatic nature. (National News, 15th)</p>

<h3>Polish Cabinet Reshuffle, Military Faction Gains Power Again</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The cabinet of Prime Minister Kościałkowski has resigned. General Skwarcowski, Deputy Minister of Military Affairs, was ordered to form a new cabinet. After several hours of negotiations, it has been completed. Skwarcowski will serve as Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. Grabowski will be Minister of Justice, and Roman will be Minister of Industry and Commerce. The outgoing Prime Minister Kościałkowski will be transferred to Minister of Labor. The other cabinet members, especially Colonel Beck, Minister of Foreign Affairs, have been re-elected. The new Prime Minister, who has served as Minister of Interior several times, is a confidant of the late General Piłsudski and has followed the late general for many years. He is 51 years old. He studied medicine. After the outbreak of the European War in 1914, he abandoned his medical career and joined the volunteer army led by General Piłsudski to fight. He made outstanding achievements and has since been promoted to his current position. The cabinet reshuffle was expected by the general public. It was realized today, which was the anniversary of the death of General Piłsudski. As for the reason for the reshuffle, the conflict between the unemployed and the police in Lviv last month was a major factor. After this incident, the semi-official Polish Express criticized the cabinet's improper handling and severely criticized it, causing the two factions under Piłsudski (the colonel faction and the civil faction) to fight each other. Prime Minister Kościałkowski was unable to stop it and had to resign. General Skwarcowski was appointed Prime Minister because of his prestige and support in the military. Political figures said that Skwarcowski was specially recommended by General Ryś-Śmigły, Chief of the General Staff. (Havas, 15th)</p>

They were bribed by a foreign country to deliberately corrupt the Tomsk Railway. Ten others were sentenced to ten years in prison for the same crime.

<h3>Excessive Gold Reserves in the United States, Financial Market Greatly Loosened</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Federal Reserve Board today submitted its annual report to President Roosevelt, stating that the gradual increase in bank reserves and the great loosening of the financial market were important financial progress in 1935. Bank reserves increased from $800,000,000 to $3,000,000,000 last year, exceeding the legal limit. This was due to the large increase in gold and silver stored in the United States. It also stated that after the devaluation of the US dollar, the huge amount of capital inflow was equal to the recovery of part of the funds that flowed out of the country in 1933. This was the result of the political instability in France. (National News, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Budget Leak Case, Tea Insurance for £750 One Hour Before Budget Announcement</h3>
<p>(London) The special court investigating the budget leak case continued its hearing today. According to an insurance broker, Sir White's son insured against the increase in tea tax for £790 one hour before the budget was announced in the House of Commons. According to a member of the Colonial Office, Sir White met with Colonial Secretary Thomas after the Easter holiday. The date could not be remembered clearly. He believed that Sir White did not enter the room because Thomas told Sir White that he was extremely busy. The two talked for at most one and a half minutes. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Chancellor Unifies Military Organization, Disarms Home Guard</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg assumed the leadership of the "Patriotic Front" today and delivered a radio address, declaring that he wanted to dissolve the Home Guard. In the future, no one in Austria except the militia will be allowed to possess weapons. Schuschnigg also told the workers that he would not investigate which party they belonged to before. All those who support Austria are welcome. The Home Guard was established in July 1927 to stop the activities of armed members of the Socialist Party. In 1932, Starhemberg reorganized it with a fascist system. It maintained domestic peace and order during the 1934 Socialist Party revolution and the Nazi Party coup. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Chancellor Schuschnigg today began to disarm the Home Guard. The Cabinet today ordered the dissolution of the "Protection Camp" in Vienna. The camp, which supplements the police, has 600 people, most of whom are members of the Home Guard. The original plan was to dissolve it on May 31, but it was expedited to prevent accidents. Only 70 people were left behind. (National News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The political community was shocked after Chancellor Schuschnigg formally announced the dissolution of semi-military organizations across the country, believing that the Chancellor's actions were so rapid that they were beyond expectations. Responsible people said that the Patriotic Guard would soon be disarmed. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The Patriotic Front, originally led by former Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg, has been taken over by Chancellor Schuschnigg, and it was declared, "Various semi-military organizations across the country have been decided to be abolished. From now on, only a strong 'militia' will be allowed to remain outside the Federal Regular Army, which is where the strength of the Patriotic Front lies. Its flag is set to be white and green. This militia and the regular army (which also includes conscripts and volunteers) should be incorporated into the Patriotic Front so that there will be no more infighting." The Chancellor did not announce when this reorganization will be implemented. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The reason for the forced resignation of Austrian Vice-Chancellor Starhemberg was that Starhemberg sent a telegram to Mussolini to congratulate him when Italian troops occupied the Abyssinian capital, which was protested by Britain and France. The leaders of the Austrian Home Guard now hope that Mussolini will come forward to intervene. People here expect that Mussolini may protest to Britain and France on the grounds that Britain and France's protest to Austria is suspected of interfering in Austria's internal affairs. The headquarters of the Home Guard has received orders from Starhemberg to strictly abide by discipline and not to act rashly. (National News, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Memorandum, Germany Postpones Reply, First Protests British Blue Book</h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet published a Blue Book on April 8, containing 99 diplomatic documents, the most important of which was a long telegram sent by Foreign Secretary Eden to the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Phipps, in March of this year. The content stated that the obligations of the signatory countries to the Locarno Treaty, including Germany, would not be changed due to the establishment of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. Regarding this matter, people in the House of Commons lounge recently declared that the German Foreign Ministry had lodged a serious protest against this Blue Book, and the British Foreign Office had also made a clear rebuttal. Therefore, the German government has to postpone answering the British memorandum of April 8 for several weeks. As for the British government's intention to send Lord Halifax, Minister of the Seal, to Germany for consultations, a spokesman for the Foreign Office recently declared, "Lord Halifax's trip is still under discussion, but now is not the time."

<h3>Palestine: Ethnic Conflicts Worsen; Ten Arabs Dead or Injured</h3>
<p>Jerusalem: Today, a crowd of about a thousand Arab rioters gathered at a mosque for prayers, then, armed with stones and sticks, clashed with police. One Arab was killed and nine were injured. Police repeatedly tried to disperse the crowd with gun butts, but to no avail, so they fired four times, and the crowd finally dispersed. The area is now calm. At the same time, the Arab Strike Committee in Jerusalem, disregarding advice, issued a declaration urging Arabs not to pay taxes. This action by the committee is a prelude to the "Disobedience Movement" that the committee planned to implement, and it is feared that even more serious disturbances will occur. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: The situation of the ongoing conflict between Palestinian Jews and Arabs remains serious. Disturbances occurred during a demonstration in the city of Jaffa today, resulting in two Arabs killed and eight injured. The state of alert here has not been lifted. The situation today is relatively stable. The Jews in this city protested to the British authorities because the mayor, Dr. Khalidi (an Arab), is politically very active and often favors Arabs. They stated that mediation efforts have failed, and the authorities should take strong measures to restore order. As for the Arab side, the Arab Higher Committee has rejected the suggestion made yesterday by the British High Commissioner, Sir Arthur Wauchope, to resolve the Jewish immigration issue. They plan to send a delegation to London immediately to petition the British government. A suggestion to form a British-Palestinian mixed committee to resolve the disputes between the Arabs and Jews through arbitration was also rejected by the committee. Furthermore, the committee decided yesterday to launch a civil disobedience movement, refusing to pay all taxes, to support the strikes. It is rumored that the government, in light of this, plans to temporarily suspend tax collection to avoid disputes, but this has not been confirmed. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Recently, the National Anti-Opium Association, finding the results of opium suppression in Gansu Province unsatisfactory, ordered the Anti-Opium Committee of the province on the 16th to make substantial improvements. The original order stated that opium detoxification should be carried out in hospitals as a principle, to avoid abuses. Counties that have not yet set up detoxification centers should quickly send experienced doctors to establish them. Many Western medicines sold as opium cures are actually powerless narcotics that greatly deceive the people and should be discontinued. However, Chinese medicine opium detoxification formulas, such as the opium detoxification formula passed down by Lin Wen-zhong of the former Qing Dynasty, use cheap raw materials that farmers can freely obtain. The committee should also report the implementation status to the Association for record. (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>

<h3>Reinforcement of Japanese Troops in North China Expedited; Three Batches Arrived on the 14th and 15th; Tianjin Japanese Military Headquarters Also Expanded; Brigade Headquarters to be Established in Peiping</h3>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: The reinforcement troops for the Japanese army stationed in North China were originally scheduled to arrive in early June. However, the Japanese military authorities believe that the current situation in Hebei and Chahar is still in an emergency period, and it is necessary to expedite the mobilization. Therefore, on the 9th of this month, they departed at the same time as the rotation troops of the 5th Division heading to Peiping and Tianjin, in order to conceal from the eyes of the powers and still claim that it was a troop rotation to the outside world. The newly added troops, part of the Fukuoka Division's infantry and cavalry, numbered more than 800, led by Lieutenant Yokoo as the transport commander. They arrived in Tianjin in two batches on the army's chartered ships Hiro Miken Maru and Hokurei Maru. The first batch of 400 men, eight artillery pieces, and more than 100 horses arrived at Dagu on the morning of the 14th. They entered the port in the afternoon with the tide and transferred to a special train on the Beining Railway, arriving in Tianjin at 11:56 PM. They disembarked at the East Station. The Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison, Nagami, as well as staff officers Hayashi, Dozoe, and senior adjutant Otake, along with hundreds of Japanese residents, including veterans, members of the National Defense Women's Association, both men and women, came to the station to welcome them. The soldiers disembarked and immediately entered the Japanese barracks at Haiguang Temple. On the 15th, another 400 men arrived in two batches, landing at Tanggu and taking trains to Tianjin, one batch at 8:25 AM and the other at 11:56 PM, also stationed at the Japanese barracks at Haiguang Temple. The main force, about 1,700 men, is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin on the 29th of this month at 8:25 AM and 6:55 PM, and will be stationed in the newly built barracks for the Japanese army in Li Mingzhuang, Dongjuzi. Subsequently, from June 5th, the troops will arrive in batches and be stationed in Yuguan, Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Luanzhou, Changli, Liushouying, Tongzhou, and along the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Jinping railways, at locations designated through prior negotiations. The small number of troops being rotated out, except for 50 engineers who returned home on the 11th, there are another 300 who are scheduled to return home by ship via Tanggu twice, on the afternoon of the 18th and the morning of June 23rd. The roofs of the Japanese garrison barracks built by the Japanese garrison in Li Mingzhuang, Tianjin, have all been tiled, and only the doors and windows remain to be installed. In another ten days or so, it should be completed. The barracks have recently purchased an additional 850 mu of civilian land, specifically for building an airfield. The price for each mu of land is uniformly 20 yuan, which the Land Office of the Beining Railway purchased on their behalf. Although the villagers did not want to sell because they felt the land price was more than this, the land was occupied first, and then the price was negotiated. Even if they objected, it was of no use, so they reluctantly accepted the payment. An additional radio station is currently being built inside the barracks. It is said that the power of the transmission is so great that it can communicate directly with Tokyo, Korea, and Changchun simultaneously. Due to the construction of the barracks, the crops of farms within five miles of the barracks have been abandoned, and even Jinxi Avenue has been blocked off. Consulates and military attachés of various countries in Tianjin are all surprised by the arrival of so many Japanese troops, and are investigating the matter. Nishida, the deputy consul of the Japanese Consulate General in Tianjin, told our reporters that there are as many as 13,000 Japanese residents in North China, just in the cities of Peiping and Tianjin and along the Beining Railway. The original troop strength was insufficient to protect the residents, so they have made special arrangements to increase it, and there is no other intention. However, the arrival of a large number of Japanese troops, and Song Zheyuan's procrastination on diplomatic issues, has led to a proliferation of rumors.</p>
<p>This time, the Japanese army in North China is not only reinforcing its troops, but also appointing a lieutenant general with the qualifications of a division commander as the commander, and has also dispatched a brigade commander, Major General Kawabe Shozo, who arrived in Tianjin from Japan at 3:50 PM on the 14th. After paying his respects to Commander Tada, he will stay for two or three days before going to Peiping to establish the brigade headquarters at the Japanese garrison in Dongjiaominxiang. The newly appointed senior staff officer of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, Iida Yasujiro, senior adjutant Kawada Yue Taro, and commander of the military police Fujita Shinji, also arrived in Tianjin a few days ago and took office. According to the Japanese military's past organization, the senior staff officer is also called the deputy chief of staff, which is equivalent to our chief of staff. Previously, this position was held by Lieutenant Colonel Ishii, but now it has been changed to a colonel-level officer. The senior adjutant is equivalent to our chief of the adjutant office, and was previously held by Major Otake, but now it is held by a lieutenant colonel-level officer. The commander of the military police was previously Captain Ikegami, and in Peiping, there was a detachment under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin team, with the detachment commander being a special warrant officer (i.e., warrant officer). Today, the commander of the Tianjin General Team is a colonel, and in Peiping, a captain-level officer will be appointed. The entire scale is larger and more extensive than before. Even the internal structure of the headquarters is divided into several departments: The Staff Department, headed by the senior staff officer, with general staff officers subordinate to it; The Adjutant Department, headed by the senior adjutant, with general adjutants subordinate to it; The Accounting Department, headed by a third-class accounting officer, with second and third-class officers subordinate to it; The Translation Department, headed by a translator, with general translation clerks subordinate to it; The Economic Advisory Department, headed by a senior staff officer, with general specialized technical personnel subordinate to it; The Investigation Team, headed by a major-level staff officer, divided into investigation and intelligence sections, each with a number of junior officers subordinate to it; The Communications Team, headed by a team leader, establishes a special communications team to communicate special intelligence with various garrisons, and manages the Dongjuzi wireless radio station; Special agencies are set up in Peiping, Tianjin, Tongzhou, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang to expand military liaison, intelligence gathering, and military, diplomatic, and political activities. The new commander, Tashiro Wanichiro, expedited his arrival due to the expedited mobilization of the reinforced troops, and is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin on the 19th and take office in the afternoon. The former commander, Tada, is scheduled to leave Tianjin on the 22nd and return home on the Nagasaki Maru on the 23rd. Japanese veterans and resident associations in Tianjin plan to hold a welcoming and farewell banquet for Tada and Tashiro at the public hall at 7:00 PM on the 21st.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the former military sub-committee warehouse in Fengtai has been entered by the Japanese troops stationed in Peiping, and is being renovated into barracks, marked as the North China Japanese Garrison Exercise Ground. It is planned to renovate more than 100 houses, which can accommodate two companies of infantry and artillery. (14th)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Discusses the Situation in Hebei and Chahar; Returned to Peiping from Tianjin on the 15th</h3>
<p>Peiping Dispatch: Song Zheyuan, chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, left Peiping for Tianjin on April 1st and has been there for a month and a half. Due to urgent government affairs, he returned to Peiping by special train at 4:40 PM on the 15th. Zhang Zizhong and Ge Dingyuan came with him. Security guards in plain clothes were on duty at the station and were very strict. After Song left the station, he returned to his private residence in Wuyiku with Fu Zhankui and Liu Ji in the same car. At 5:30 PM, he met with the press and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Regarding the Hebei-Eastern Chahar Issue</p>
<p>"After I arrived in Tianjin, I was detained for many days due to a throat illness. There has been much speculation in society, so I rushed back to meet with everyone to dispel the doubts. I met with Nagami in Tianjin but did not discuss political issues. I met with Matsushiro, and he only stated that he was responsible for the negotiations. I met with Tada and exchanged views on Sino-Japanese relations and resolving the Hebei-Eastern Chahar issue. Tada stated that the Hebei-Eastern Chahar issue could be resolved, and that the abolition of the organization was only a matter of time. I have always discussed any issue more than once, and at most three times. If it still cannot be resolved, then I can only let nature take its course. When Doihara was in Peiping to negotiate this issue, he said that it could be resolved in two months, but it has not been realized to this day. Even if we talk, it will not help. This matter appears to be a local issue on the surface, but it is actually of great importance to Sino-Japanese relations. It is also a problem for the local area. Tada and Matsushiro are both people who advocate abolishing the Hebei-Eastern Chahar organization, but several members of the Japanese Kwantung Army oppose it, so it cannot be resolved. The principle is that the limits of authority are not clear. It is still doubtful whether the Japanese Garrison or the Japanese Kwantung Army is responsible for negotiating this matter. I plan to discuss the matter with the new commander of the Japanese Garrison, Tashiro, after he takes office, so as to determine the person in charge and then proceed with the negotiations.</p>
<p>Preventing Smuggling</p>
<p>The problem of smuggling in North China is not limited to the provinces of Hebei and Chahar. Shandong and other parts of South China also have this problem. This did not start today. It has been unresolved for about three or four years. However, recently smuggling has become more rampant than before. Our country suffers a great loss from the inability to prevent smuggling. In April alone, our income decreased by 1.4 million yuan. Japanese merchants also suffer losses. When I was in Tianjin, I met with the Tianjin Customs Commissioner. He hoped that I would assist in the suppression of smuggling. I replied that this was diplomatic language, and we should speak the truth. My opinion on preventing smuggling is that the Chinese and Japanese governments must have a solution and proceed in a normal way in order to be effective. If warships escort smuggled goods, this is not normal and cannot be investigated. The issue is the tax rate. Merchants are all driven by profit. If their goods originally cost 150 yuan, and the tax is 200 yuan, the total cost becomes 350 yuan. If they can only sell it for 220 yuan, they will naturally resort to other means. I have heard that the Ministry of Finance may revise the tax rate. The authority should be unified. Whether it is the police or the anti-smuggling team, even if they assist the customs, it is only superficial. If there is a unified order assigning responsibility to a specific person, then everything will be more convenient. If these three issues are resolved and the administrative power of the customs is returned to the Chinese, then smuggling prevention can be expected.</p>
<p>Japanese Troop Reinforcements</p>
<p>We were not notified of the issue of increasing the number of Japanese garrison troops. According to the treaty, the Japanese army can only station 800 people. In 1933, the Japanese army increased to 5,000 people. At that time, the government's power was still here, and its military strength was also strong, but it did not interfere. There is no good way to do it. The people only have to pay taxes and obey orders to the government, and their hope for the government is only to protect the local area and resolve suffering. It is a common problem of our Chinese people to blame others instead of ourselves, so I advocate that we should study the needs of the people and the needs of society and work hard to save the country.</p>
<p>The Question of Prince De's Independence</p>
<p>The rumor of Prince De's independence has been circulating for a long time. He is not only restrained but also oppressed. Even if there is anything else, it is caused by environmental oppression. His heart will never be divided. For example, Jiang Wei could not have been better than Zhuge Liang if it were not for his circumstances. How could he have surrendered to the Han? Moreover, the Republic of China has not done anything wrong to Prince De."</p>
<p>The Issue of Preserving Territory</p>
<p>Finally, someone asked Song for his opinion on preserving the territory of Hebei and Chahar. Song said that he did not dare to say anything about this matter for the time being. There are those who advocate war and those who advocate peace. Those who advocate war are out of patriotic enthusiasm, and those who advocate peace also have their views and are not out of patriotic hearts. However, the person in charge must issue orders in a unified manner, like Zhou Yu's battle against Cao Cao. I cannot advocate either peace or war. This shows that he is a soldier and obeys all orders. Talking about the issue of anti-communism, Song said that he believed that any party that is consistent in words and deeds can succeed. The Communist Party says one thing and does another, which is hated by the people and is not what the people want, so he has always opposed it. He planned to rest a bit in Peiping and then go on inspection. (15th)</p>
<p>Overseas Correspondence</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Liverpool</h3>
<p>— Zhen Chi</p>
<p>Liverpool, located at 2.5 degrees west longitude and 53.5 degrees north latitude, is the second largest port in England. It connects to London in the south, Manchester in the west, and Glasgow in the north. Bordering the Irish Sea to the west, it is easily accessible to Ireland by sea. The city has a high volume of both land and sea traffic, making transportation extremely convenient. The number of ships entering and leaving the port each year is second only to London and surpasses Glasgow. The major exports are cotton textiles from Manchester, wool textiles from Yorkshire, steel from the Black Country, and iron products from the city itself. The major imports are cotton from the United States, wool from Australia, and timber and food from Canada. On average, the city has a large trade surplus, resulting in a high standard of living for its residents.</p>
<p>The city is six miles long and five miles wide. The streets are mostly not very straight, as the British tend to be conservative and rarely make changes to existing structures. A canal connects directly to Manchester, about 50 kilometers long. All waterways (including the Mersey River), sea routes, and roads converge in the southwestern part of the city, making transportation extremely convenient. The city has many parks, the largest of which is called Sefton Park. It is about one mile long and half a mile wide, featuring a zoo and a tropical greenhouse (with coconut trees and betel palms from the South Seas, as well as camellias, chrysanthemums, and bamboo from China). Rare birds and exotic animals, as well as precious flowers and plants, are gathered in one place. In the summer, many tourists visit, creating a scene similar to the pilgrimage to Lingyin Temple or the tide-watching at Haining in China, which is quite a spectacle.</p>
<p>During a recent spring break, I visited the city and would like to describe the situation of the overseas Chinese here. I believe this will be of interest to those concerned with overseas Chinese affairs.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in Liverpool and the nearby cities of Lancashire, Cheshire, and Wales numbered about four to five thousand around 1916 or 1917 (when there was no consulate yet). They were concentrated in the Pitt Street area. After the European War, many British soldiers returned home and were unemployed, leading to the exclusion of overseas Chinese by all means possible. Their businesses were interfered with, those who returned to China could not come back, and new arrivals faced many difficulties. In the last three years (1922 to 1925), only about four hundred people remained (including about fifty in Manchester), along with 150 family members. According to Consul Tao, the exact figures will be available after the current registration of overseas Chinese is completed.</p>
<p>In terms of the classification of overseas Chinese businesses, in the last three years, there have been about 100 laundries, three restaurants, six grocery stores, and about 200 sailors. All businesses have declined significantly in the past three years, especially restaurants. Laundries have suffered from competition from large-scale British-owned laundry businesses, and their business is not as good as before. Grocery stores can still maintain operations. The largest grocery store is called Guang Tai Yuan, owned by a Mr. Liu from Taishan. All the goods are Chinese products, mostly food and daily necessities. Some books and stationery are also available. Most of the overseas Chinese businessmen here are from the four counties of Taishan, Enping, etc., in Guangdong Province. There are fewer people from other provinces. The capital of each overseas Chinese business is small, and their management is old-fashioned. The store displays, marketing methods, management methods, and accounting systems are all outdated. In addition, the British government restricts the entry of overseas Chinese who want to operate laundries, grocery stores, or restaurants. This restriction has recently extended to adult children coming to the UK, so in the future, there will inevitably be no one to take over, leading to closures and bankruptcies.</p>
<p>Regarding the education of overseas Chinese, in the spring of 1925, there were a total of fourteen students studying in Liverpool (funded by public and private sources). About fifty or sixty overseas Chinese children attend elementary schools in Liverpool and nearby areas. (The elementary school students I saw on the street were clean and lively.) Currently, the British government enforces compulsory education up to the age of fourteen. Therefore, after the age of fourteen, regardless of whether they have graduated from elementary school, they try to find jobs in factories and shops. Occasionally, one or two students with excellent grades receive school subsidies and enter higher schools. Otherwise, there are no overseas Chinese elementary schools or private schools. Some years ago, some enthusiastic educators planned to set up a private Chinese school, but they gave up due to the inability to raise funds.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese girls are no less talented than others. One female elementary school student won the highest award for piano performance at the age of eight and also excels in the violin. She is now twelve years old and still in school. In her spare time, she teaches Mr. Liu, a Guangdong government-funded student, to play the piano. A Mr. Zhou, an overseas Chinese student, is studying biochemistry at the University of Liverpool. From middle school to university, he has received the highest grades in examinations for eight years, and has been awarded scholarships every year. In addition to free tuition, he also has surplus funds to subsidize his family. This gentleman does not know Chinese, but he is very concerned about national affairs. He cuts out and treasures news about domestic affairs and the speeches of important figures that are published in local newspapers and magazines. Whenever public or private students come to the school, he meets with them and asks eagerly about the situation in the motherland. He will graduate this year, but he will not be able to find a job in the UK and does not know Chinese when he returns to China. It is not yet known how he will make a living. Speaking of this, I hope that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will order consulates in various overseas locations to investigate these outstanding talents at any time, find ways to make them study Chinese, and help them return to China for service after graduation. If this can be done, China's construction can gain more practical talents.</p>
<p>Marriage Issues: Due to the difficulty of bringing families when coming here, many overseas Chinese marry Western women. According to investigations, Western women are very satisfied with marrying overseas Chinese because they are mostly independently employed. Husbands serve their wives and children, and are able to work hard and endure hardships. If they marry Western men, they are mostly workers, and husbands never help with housework. Comparing the two, the difference is vast. Two Western sisters married two overseas Chinese and each had seven or eight children (overseas Chinese do not practice much birth control). One recently died in the hospital, and his wife cried very sadly, showing the depth of their feelings. It is very difficult for overseas Chinese women to marry. Most are unwilling to settle down easily. Westerners mostly disdain to marry them, and Chinese men are mostly unwilling to marry them. There is no money to return to China to marry. Under these difficult circumstances, there are quite a few women who temporarily take up the profession of prostitutes standing on the streets at night. This is also a major problem.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese organization is the Zhi Gong Tang, with the chairmanship elected annually. Gu Genfu, Liu Yucao, Mei Dong, Guo Zixiang, Huang Yu, etc., are all important figures. It contains several newspapers, such as the Hong Kong Dazhong Bao, the Cuban Overseas Chinese News, and the Shanghai-Guangdong News. Listening to their speeches, they strongly advocate the recovery of lost territories and the restoration of national rights. They admire Mr. Hu Zhantang the most among modern great men. In addition, there is also a Kuomintang branch, which does more work than the Zhi Gong Tang.</p>
<p>The operation of national goods, in addition to a few grocery stores, is entirely in the hands of British merchants. These British merchants also have contacts in China, but the power to choose goods lies entirely in the hands of the British. Consul Tao believes that the steps to promote national goods should start from within China. There should be well-organized Chinese exporters or factories. The products should be sorted by Chinese merchants themselves and have unified standards. (Currently, the export of national goods is collected and sorted by foreign merchants in China, so the market conditions of Chinese goods overseas can be imagined.) Chinese merchants should make more use of existing embassies and consulates, designate a certain type of commodity, and ask them to investigate market conditions. Please ask the customs offices of the five countries to record the foreign import merchants at the time of export, so that embassies and consulates can be entrusted to contact them. In short, Chinese merchants should closely contact the various consulates stationed abroad in order to achieve effective results. Otherwise, the monthly economic and commercial reports of each consulate, which are sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and selected for publication in the Ministry's gazette, will not be of any benefit to practical sales methods. Consul Tao has ample experience and is very conscientious in his work, which is rare.</p>
<p>As for the consulate in Manchester, it is a vice consulate. It is said that the number of overseas Chinese merchants in Manchester used to be at most forty, but it has now increased to forty-seven (with families abroad). There are also about forty or fifty public and private students studying abroad. The overseas Chinese businesses are all laundries, totaling twenty-one. In the past, they made a lot of profit, and many invested in real estate. In recent years, income has decreased, barely covering expenses. The children are all educated in British schools, the same as those in Liverpool. There are no private schools for overseas Chinese children. There are three or four overseas Chinese students in higher schools. There is a student association for students studying abroad, with Zhang Genyu and Zhou Zonglian as the presidents. Otherwise, there are no other organizations. Although Jiao Tong University students and Gengkuan students often have dinners together, there is no permanent organization. Overseas Chinese merchants live in various locations in the city center. The national goods sold in Manchester are mainly eggs, followed by tea and carpets. Judging from the declining sales volume year by year, it is feared that they will eventually disappear.</p>
<p>It is found that Westerners preserve eggs by using a kind of water glass (liquid colloid) applied to the eggshell to isolate the inside and outside, which can preserve them permanently. This water glass, sold in 3-penny cans, can coat 100 eggs. It is not known whether Chinese egg merchants also use the same method.</p>
<p>It is also found that Japanese goods sold here include cotton textiles, porcelain, tea, eggs, iron products, stationery, toys, etc. In the past, bicycles were sold here, each selling for only about fifteen shillings, which was very popular for a time. Later, due to government restrictions on sales, and the bike shops refusing to repair them, they gradually disappeared. In short, most of the lightest and cheapest products on the market are Japanese goods. Also, all Japanese goods must be printed with the word "Foreign," meaning foreign goods, but the products of other European and American countries all directly mark the country name. The Japanese merchants' skill in speculation is evident here.</p>
<p>The Japanese learned the yarn weaving technique from Manchester, England. After they succeeded, they stopped sending students abroad. In less than twenty years, they surpassed their teachers. Japanese cotton textiles have flooded the British market, and the British still talk about it with fear. Looking back at China's continuous sending of students abroad for study and practice, what is the result? What is the result of the overseas Chinese merchants' promotion of national goods? Although it is said that Japan has its own seagoing ships and we do not, and that Japan has military and financial strength as backing and we do not, the source is from within. It is time to act. All levels of the Chinese government should know where to encourage themselves.</p>
<p>Also, the insulting China films shown here mostly come from the United States. Occasionally, there are one or two British productions. Although the degree of insult has decreased compared to before, the haggard overseas Chinese people, the smuggling overseas Chinese thieves, and the smoking and gambling overseas Chinese criminals still appear in person, which is often seen. Occasionally, there are those who are hired to attend variety shows and perform vulgar acts. I blame one, the overseas Chinese are too unprincipled (stemming from a lack of knowledge), unable to resist the temptation of a few shillings, and do not hesitate to take off the ordinary clothes they usually wear, change into strange and grotesque broken clothes and costumes, and perform vulgar acts. Two, the British and Americans do not hesitate to destroy international relations and never perform stories of commendable Chinese upper class people, but only think from the vulgar actions of low-level tastes to gain the surprise of ordinary audiences. Three, those in charge of overseas Chinese affairs do not actively prohibit joining performances, and passively provide training and timely protests. Four, the Chinese government does not make its own films to promote abroad.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese (and students studying abroad) are valued in school (because they mostly have excellent grades), but once they leave school and step into the city center, they are despised everywhere (due to the influence of vulgar overseas Chinese). Alas, what else can I say?</p>
<h3>Grain Taxes in Guangdong Province Changed to Temporary Land Tax; 1% of Land Price Levied, Original Taxes Abolished</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong provincial authorities believe that the grain tax system has been in place for a long time and has many malpractices. There is land without grain tax, and grain tax without land. Good land has a light tax, and barren land has a heavy tax. This is the major problem of the grain tax system. Reform is necessary to alleviate the people's difficulties and show fairness. At the beginning of the first three-year plan, in order to reduce the people's burden and enrich their livelihood, the Finance Department decided to abolish the grain tax system and change to temporary land tax. It drafted a plan for the change and submitted it to the provincial government for approval and implementation. The implementation method is to first draft regulations for surveying land, order all counties to follow the regulations and survey land within a time limit, and set up temporary land tax collector training classes to train land tax collectors for future dispatch to various counties. After several months of investigation, the counties completed the survey one after another and reported to the Finance Department. The Finance Department then drafted methods for spot-checking land area and evaluating land prices, sent personnel to various counties to spot-check the area of land, and established district and county evaluation committees to assess the land price. After the land price was assessed, trained collectors were sent to various counties to set up temporary land tax supervision offices, organize land survey registers, reorganize them into land registers, and announce the start of collecting temporary land tax. Currently, except for Zhongshan County and the three newly established counties in Qiongyai, which have special circumstances and have not yet completed the evaluation, so they have not been able to change to land tax, the remaining counties have all started collecting. The collection method is based on the land price, and the annual collection must not exceed 1% of the land price (that is, for every 100 yuan of land price, the annual collection must not exceed 1 yuan, and so on). The collection period is divided into two phases: the first phase is from July to September, and the second phase is from January to March. If anyone is willing to pay in one lump sum, it is limited to payment in the first phase. After the land tax is implemented, all original taxes on the land should be abolished at the same time. However, the temporary land tax will not increase or decrease due to the year's harvest. It is estimated that after the temporary land tax is fully implemented, the burden on the people will be reduced significantly, and the prosperity of the rural economy can also be supplemented.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Two Bandits Arrested and Sent to Songjiang</h3>
<p>Li Jinxiang, the bandit leader of robbery cases in the Punan area, was arrested by Captain Zhao Zanchen and presented to the Third District Security Command for interrogation. Yesterday, Fei Gongxia, captain of the Water Patrol Team, reported that Li Jinxiang's accomplices were active in the Minhang area. He sent patrol boat No. 2 Xia Shuye to investigate. He found Zhang Linsheng, also known as Zhang Alin, at the north end of the Minhang Nan Ferry. He confessed that his accomplice, Gu Jinfa, was hiding in the De Yi Tea Garden in Caojing. The team was then led to search and Gu Jinfa was arrested. He was sent to the Water Patrol Team headquarters on the 16th to await interrogation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Farmers Destroy Patrol Station</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been vulgar Huagudeng performances in various villages in the county. The villages near Chenmu Town in the Sixth District are even more prevalent. Chief Chen of the police management area learned about this and led the police to persuade them on the 15th. However, the farmers and spectators at the scene refused to obey and started a riot. More than 300 people swarmed into the patrol station and destroyed all the objects. Police officer Wang Zhibin was severely beaten and seriously injured, and his life is in danger. He telegraphed the details to the General Bureau that day and decided to investigate the instigators and detain them according to law.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Watchman of Silk Factory Beaten to Death</h3>
<p>The Defenghe Weaving Factory at No. 47 Gushi Lane in the Lümen area was opened by Wang Junde. The factory has more than 20 workers. The 15th was a holiday, so all the workers and staff were not in the factory. Only Xu Damou, a 58-year-old watchman, guarded the gate at night. However, at about 7:00 am on the 16th, when the workers entered the factory to work, they suddenly saw that the gate was open and Xu Damou, the watchman, was dead next to the gate. His head and other places were beaten with iron objects. His head was brutally flattened, and his body was lying on his back in a pool of blood, which was unbearable to look at. After inspecting the workshop, they saw that the satin pieces that had been woven on five iron machines had been cut off and stolen. Judging from the situation, it was known that Xu Damou was undoubtedly beaten to death by thieves. They immediately reported to the factory owner, who reported to the Public Security Bureau. Director Zhang immediately sent detective Xue and others of the Detective Team to inspect and start tracking down the murderer. At the same time, the local police reported to the local prosecutor's office, which sent personnel to inspect at 11:00 am. The factory was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial and to strictly apprehend the murderer for investigation.</p>
<h3>Chuansha: Four Thieves Arrested in Xiangshun Township Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Wei Wende, the head of Xiangshun Township in the Fourth District of this county, led the guards of the Wangshousuo to arrest Chen Longxiang (from X港乡 in the Third District) and Zhang Yinquan (from Xiangshun Township), two thieves who robbed the Kaihe family in Qintang, and seized many stolen goods. On the night of the 15th, Gu Songmei, the acting head of Cailu Township, led the guards of the Wangshousuo and arrested Zhang [blank] Gen (from Nanhui) and Ji Xiunian (from Haimen), two repeat offenders who committed robbery, near the East Tomb of Nantang in Qingdun Township. They were all sent to the county for handling according to law.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Absurd Monk Commits Suicide in Hotel</h3>
<p>Ciben, a monk from the Baiyidian in Huishan, this county, and the great-grandson of the abbot Huixin, was 35 years old. He was originally from Shangyou, Jiangbei. Because he liked gambling and did not abide by the Qing rules, he was expelled by Huixin to Suzhou in January of this year. On the 12th of this month, he returned to Wuxi and stayed in room 24 of the Jiaotong Hotel north of the Gongyun Bridge, changing his name to Pukang. The next day, he went to the Changtai Temple in Nanfangquan for sightseeing and was suspected of being a thief. He was beaten by Lu Shiliang, a famous person in the temple, and sent to the Second Wangshousuo in Nanfangquan for detention for one day. Later, because there was no evidence, he was released. After being humiliated, Ciben was filled with grief and decided to end his life. He still stayed at the Jiaotong Hotel. When it was late at night and everyone was quiet, he untied his belt and hanged himself. He was discovered by Zhang Jinmao, the tea room attendant of the hotel, but he had already died. Xi Zhiliang, the head of the Tian San Tu, reported to the court for an autopsy. The prosecutor, accompanied by the forensic examiner Wang, went to conduct an autopsy and confirmed that he had died by hanging himself. He ordered the dead man's ancestor, the monk Huixin, to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Aircraft to Celebrate Chiang's Birthday</h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce of this county, because it received an order from the county to the province to celebrate the 50th birthday of Chairman Chiang, Jiangsu Province plans to purchase a squadron of aircraft, a total of nine aircraft, each priced at 80,000 yuan in national currency. The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce is assigned to raise 20,000 yuan in national currency. In order to show the unanimous respect of local merchants and people for the meritorious founding father of the party and the country, they should enthusiastically subscribe and submit the funds within the time limit. After receiving the order, the Chamber of Commerce submitted it to the fifth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for discussion yesterday. It was resolved that all executive and supervisory committee members should be responsible for actively soliciting subscriptions from various industries, enthusiastically subscribing, and submitting as much as possible. In addition, the National Goods Promotion Exhibition and the Aircraft Donation and Birthday Celebration will be held at No. 14 Huangni Bridge, Qianjie Street, County Hall, for three weeks. Starting today, national goods manufacturers will be asked to participate without charging a venue fee. Only a percentage of the business income of each merchant will be used to help buy aircraft to mark the celebration.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Jiangsu and Zhejiang Send Personnel to Survey Shengsi</h3>
<p>There was a previous saying that Chongming Shengsi Islands should be transferred to the administration of Zhejiang Province. After the fishermen and local people of the island opposed it seven times, it has been suspended for a long time. Now the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces plan to send personnel to conduct a joint survey at the end of this month. Zhejiang Province will send the commissioner of the Ningbo district, and Jiangsu Province will send the commissioner of the Nantong district.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Floating Opium Dens</h3>
<p>There are many floating opium dens along the Jiangbian wharf area, but they are all from the poor class. The Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital has captured many people who privately smoke and sell opium near the Zhentong wharf for days, and they have all been sent to the county government for handling according to law.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Eleven Weigang Lightship Robbed</h3>
<p>The lightships on the river surface in Nantong County have been repeatedly robbed by bandits. The lightship outside the Eleven Weigang port in Changyinsha was invaded by river pirates on the 13th and robbed of kerosene, clothing, and other items belonging to the manager. It has been reported to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Riverbank Collapse; Villagers Petition</h3>
<p>Recently, the Yao Dong Langshan area of Tongyi has been experiencing large tides, and the collapse is getting worse.

<h3>The Ministry of Communications Tries to Save the Shipping Industry; Convening a Conference on the Reorganization of the Private Shipping Industry; To Be Held on the 20th at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association believes that the current environment facing shipping merchants is more urgent than ever before. If no measures are taken to rescue them, they will be unable to maintain operations and face imminent danger. They had previously requested the issuance of 10 million yuan in shipping industry public bonds to rescue the dying shipping merchants, but it was ultimately rejected due to a lack of funds. Furthermore, the China Shipping Industry Cooperation Design Committee, which was previously organized, after six months of research, drafted a concrete plan for China shipping industry cooperation. Although it was approved and announced by the Ministry of Communications, and a council of the China Shipping Industry Cooperative was established to handle cooperative matters, it was halted due to various reasons. Yu Feipeng, Acting Minister of the Ministry of Communications, in an effort to save the shipping industry, will reorganize the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, such as abolishing the comprador system, strictly prohibiting fare evasion, and cracking down on tea room extortion of alcohol fees. These measures have already been implemented one after another. Now, in order to reorganize the private shipping industry, he has decided to convene various shipping companies to hold a conference on the reorganization of the private shipping industry, scheduled to be held on the 20th at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to decide on reorganization methods.</p>

<h3>Recent Statistics on Smuggling in North China; In the One-Week Period from May 4th to May 10th; Tax Revenue Losses Amounted to 1.8 Million Yuan; From August of Last Year to May 10th of This Year; Total Tax Revenue Losses Amounted to 20 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter learned from customs yesterday the following recent statistics on smuggling in North China: In the one-week period from May 4th to May 10th, the tax revenue losses due to smuggled goods transported from Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, Nandasi, Changli, Liushouying, and other places to Tianjin East Station amounted to approximately 1.8 million yuan. From August 1st of last year to May 10th of this year, the tax revenue losses due to smuggled goods amounted to approximately 30 million yuan. The types of smuggled goods transported to Tianjin in the one-week period from May 4th to May 10th are as follows: A. 3,025 packages or 136,125 kilograms of rayon; B. 70,717 packages or 6,364,530 kilograms of white sugar; C. 487 packages or 30,291 kilograms of cigarette paper; D. 3,114 boxes of piece goods, weight unknown; E. 8,594 boxes of miscellaneous goods, weight unknown (Note: Item E's miscellaneous goods include 4,775 boxes of kerosene (10 gallons per box), and the remainder consists of dried seafood, food, cosmetics, electrical supplies, bicycle parts, raincoats, cheese, fish glue wide elastic band, 18 boxes of handguns, and 500 boxes of gasoline).</p>
<p>Sun Ke's Remarks</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, met with reporters yesterday morning to discuss the issue of smuggling in North China. Sun said, "Smuggling in North China has now become a serious problem. This is not just China's problem, but it has become an international problem. It is a well-known fact that smuggling in North China is condoned by the Japanese side. In fact, smuggling in North China not only causes significant losses to China, but also causes intangible losses to Japan. Because smuggling in North China has become a serious international problem, this is truly Japan's greatest shame."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Seeks Information</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that the issue of smuggling in North China is of great importance. Yesterday, it specially sent letters to the sugar industry, woolen industry, cotton cloth industry, silk industry, paper industry, electrical manufacturing industry, ginseng and bird's nest industry, and other trade associations to seek information on the impact of this matter. The letter stated, "We recently received a letter from Executive Committee member Hu Xiyuan, stating that smuggling in North China has spread to almost the entire country, not only damaging government tax revenue, but also destroying the national economy. Please convene all committee members to discuss effective ways to crack down on smuggling and submit proposals to the government for implementation, etc. We plan to first ask your association to provide a written response to this association by the 20th of this month (i.e., next Wednesday) regarding the impact of smuggling in North China on your industry and the methods that can be used to stop smuggling, so that we can be better prepared and more effective when we meet to discuss this matter. Please investigate and handle this matter promptly."</p>
<p>Impact on Sugar Merchants</p>
<p>An External Affairs Agency translation of the Continental Report states that in the first three months of this year, the legal import volume of sugar nationwide decreased by almost 50% compared to the same period last year. This situation is all caused by smuggling in North China. According to customs statistics, the value of sugar legally imported in the first three months of this year was 4,604,024 gold units, while in the same period last year, it was 8,056,565 gold units. However, the above figures are still not enough to represent the impact on China's legitimate sugar industry, because 88% of the sugar imported in the first three months of this year was ordered at the end of last year. Although 60% of China's sugar industry is in the Shanghai market, North China accounts for more than 10%, and South China accounts for 30%. Currently, the volume of smuggled goods is greatest for sugar, second only to rayon. Since the beginning of this year, approximately 75,000 tons of sugar have been smuggled in through Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan. The above quantity is truly astonishing, as it accounts for one-third of the total national consumption in January, February, March, and April. If sugar smuggling continues, it is likely that 225,000 tons of smuggled sugar will enter the country through North China this year. Although all of the smuggled sugar currently uses Japanese brands, not all of it is necessarily Japanese goods. Javanese sugar also accounts for a large portion, because it is shipped to Japan as raw goods, refined in Japan, and then exported to China. The sugar consumed domestically in Japan is mostly produced by Taiwanese sugar factories. Since January of this year, the sugar smuggled in through North China has gradually penetrated the interior, and the sugar industries in Tianjin and Shanghai have been completely destroyed. Among them, the Shanghai merchants have suffered the greatest impact, because the sugar markets in Central and Western China are all supplied by Shanghai merchants.</p>

<p>Ministry of Industries Guidance</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reporters learned from the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Office that several thousand boxes of tea leaves have been shipped from Qimen, Yicheng, and Anqing in Jiangxi and Anhui provinces in recent days.

<h3>Gu Zhihe Returns from Inspection, Freely Discussing the Japanese Silk Industry; Government, People, and Financial Circles Cooperate Fully; Total Silk Production is Ten Times Greater Than That of Our Country; Will Go to Beijing Next Week to Report on the Inspection</h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, Ms. Gu Zhihe, a special commissioner sent by the Ministry of Industries to Japan for inspection, has completed her three-month inspection in Japan and returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. on the Japanese postal ship Shanghai Maru. Gu's friends and relatives, including Tian Xuzhao Feng and her younger siblings, went to the port to welcome her. Gu's findings from the inspection will be reported to the ministry in Beijing next week. Our reporter interviewed Gu on the ship yesterday, and her remarks are recorded below.</p>
<p>Three Months of Inspection in Japan</p>
<p>Gu first said, "I was ordered to go to Japan for inspection this time, and I took leave from the Suzhou Yousheng Fengxi Silkworm Seed Farm in February of this year and departed from Shanghai. In total, I spent three months in Japan, specializing in the inspection of silk and its by-products. After arriving in Japan, I was warmly received by the Japanese government authorities, and under the guidance of our country's embassy and consulate in Japan, and with the assistance of personal friends, the inspection work progressed smoothly. I conducted a general inspection of major cities in the Japanese silk center areas, such as Ibaraki, Oji, the Islands, and Kyushu. I visited all major silk production factories and engaged in in-depth discussions."</p>
<p>Progress Worth Emulating</p>
<p>The progress of the Japanese silk industry has been quite good. All silk businesses in Japan are not only completely scientific in technology, but also have government leadership in front, people's efforts behind, and financial circles mediating from the side. It is truly so-called cooperation worth emulating, so the increase in its output has also been rapid in recent years. Roughly, according to statistics, the total output of Japanese silk recently is ten times more than that of our country. Looking back at the domestic silkworm business, there is a need to catch up quickly and make improvements in order to avoid being gradually eliminated and to seek the development of the silk business along the right track, so as to save the rural economy and develop domestic industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Quality Inferior to Our Country</p>
<p>But in terms of silk quality, Japanese silk is far inferior to ours. The easiest way to distinguish it is that our silk has luster, while Japanese silk does not. Therefore, the silk fabrics produced are naturally more durable in our country. This is a natural relationship and cannot be controlled by science or human power. Therefore, if our country's silk industry can make great efforts to improve, it is believed that it will surely be able to stand in an invincible position. At present, the preliminary procedures for improving silk in China (improving the manufacturing factory) have been underway for many years. Secondly, reeling is also in progress. As for the improvement of mulberry tree cultivation and all other silk by-products, it is hoped that they will be completely improved in the shortest possible time. Therefore, the future of our country's silk industry will soon be able to rival other countries.</p>
<p>Technology Rivals Europe and America</p>
<p>Finally, when talking about the Japanese industry, it is said that the Japanese industry was originally mostly light industry, but recently it has gradually shifted from light industry to heavy industry. Manufacturing technology is comparable to that of advanced industrial countries in Europe and America. However, it seems that the raw materials are not sufficient unless they are purchased from foreign countries. The Japanese industrial sector recognizes this as the biggest shortcoming, but there is no way to make up for it. It is heard that Gu will rest in Shanghai for a few days and go to Beijing in about a week to meet with Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry to report on the inspection.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Replies to Two Fellow Provincials' Associations: Zhejiang Fish and Salt Still to Be Handled According to Previous Approval</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, for the discoloration of fish and salt in Zhejiang Province, replied to the Ningbo and Dinghai Fellow Provincials' Associations, saying, "We have received your telegrams, each requesting a temporary exemption from the implementation of discoloration of fish and salt in Zhejiang Province. The telegrams and submissions are all noted. It is found that this case was previously submitted to the Ministry by the Association, stating that the use of red soil and charcoal powder to change the color of fish and salt would damage the color and taste of the fish, and requesting that rice bran, etc., be used instead. The Ministry has already approved and issued instructions. It is now reported that the previous approval should still be followed. This is the reply."</p>

<h3>The China Yangtze River Leading River Association Appeals for Jurisdiction by the Ministry of Transportation; Central Government Sends Personnel to Investigate...Telegrams the Whole Country for Assistance</h3>
<p>The China Yangtze River Leading River Association stated that the Shanghai Pilot Management Committee's recognition of the legal qualifications of graduates from the Naval Department's Pilot Training Institute and the restriction on the number of practitioners are considered to be in violation of the government's original intention of regaining management, which will put China's pilotage business in a state of irrecoverable disaster. Not only will the livelihood of Chinese pilots be cut off, but the future of national defense is also deeply concerning. In order to save the situation, it has specially submitted a report to the Chinese Seamen's Party Branch, requesting it to forward it to the central government to abolish the organization of the committee and change to direct management of pilots by the Ministry of Transportation. Zhang Jianbai, a section chief from the Central People's Training Department, has come to Shanghai to investigate. In order to thoroughly solve the problem and request assistance from all sectors, the Association has once again submitted a report and issued a telegram, making a large-scale appeal to arouse the attention of the people of the country. It plans to send representatives to Beijing in the coming days to petition, hoping to realize the transfer to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation as soon as possible. The original text of the telegram is recorded below. To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Political Party, and the Party Headquarters of all provinces across the country, the governments of all provinces, all people's organizations, and all newspapers: Since the opening of the five ports and the opening of inland river navigation, China's pilotage business has gradually aroused the coveting of foreigners. In the seventh year of Tongzhi, Robert Hart, the British Customs Commissioner of Jianghai, established the General Pilotage Regulations, stipulating that foreigners could serve as pilots in China. Following this, Darell, a British river superintendent in Shanghai, arbitrarily designated the Tongsha area to be exclusively managed and operated by foreigners. From then on, there was no room for Chinese pilots in the coastal ports around Tongsha, and insurance companies refused to insure ships piloted by Chinese, helping the wicked to injure the Chinese fatally. Therefore, the pilotage affairs along the Yangtze River were almost entirely taken over by foreigners. Woe to our people, who have suffered destruction for decades. Countries all over the world value national defense, and they all manage pilotage themselves, strictly prohibiting foreign participation. Only China does the opposite, leading to a flood of foreign personnel and endangering national defense. The previous attacks by French warships into the Min Port and Japanese warships into the Liu River can serve as a warning. Thinking of this, how can we not loosen our fingers? Fortunately, in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, our National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and in view of the importance of pilotage rights, it made great efforts to recover management and strengthen national defense. Therefore, the Shanghai Pilotage Training Institute was established. At that time, a total of 317 trainees who passed the training were qualified. Subsequently, in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Provisional Regulations for Pilotage Management were promulgated, and the pilotage management committee was organized jointly by the Ministry of Transportation, the General Staff, the Navy, and the Ministry of Finance. Chinese pilots were then delighted to break away from the sea of ​​suffering and enjoy government protection. However, the content of the committee is greatly misleading. It is called government management, but in reality, it is still manipulated by foreign customs officials. The sovereignty of the committee belongs to the Ministry of Finance, and the representative of the Ministry of Finance is a foreign customs official, so they can continue to manipulate and have real management power, using the government's prestige as their backing, so that they are blatant and unscrupulous. In the past two years, there have been many inappropriate measures, which are not what the government originally intended to establish, nor what we initially expected. To name a few, such as the recognition of the qualifications of the pilotage training institute, the increase in pilotage fees, and the restriction on the number of pilots, are all policies that restrict the Chinese. Their intention is nothing more than to make China's pilotage business bankrupt forever. If the situation is not urgently remedied, the organization of the committee will be abolished, and foreign personnel will be refused participation, then the dangerous situation in the future is unimaginable. Also, pilot personnel belong to technical personnel, not goods, and are no different from marine engineers, drivers, and other personnel. They should be directly managed by the Ministry of Transportation, which is in line with logic. At present, the Ministry of Finance has appointed foreign customs officials as representatives to preside over the meeting, which has a hundred harms and no benefit. The country's sovereignty lies, the safety of national defense is at stake, and our association feels threatened and cannot remain silent. In addition to submitting a report to the Central Executive Committee, we will immediately abolish the Pilotage Management Committee and change to direct management of all pilotage personnel in the country by the Ministry of Transportation, and stipulate that all those who have passed the training of the Naval Department's Pilotage Training Institute, hold a certificate, or have served for more than five years without negligence or danger, and have the certificate of the shipowner, can be exempted from the examination and perform their duties, so as to protect the legally obtained qualifications, prevent foreign manipulation, and strengthen national defense. We also ask the national seamen's organizations to advocate and assist in the appeal, and work together to achieve the goal as soon as possible. It is fortunate for the people of the country, and fortunate for national defense. The telegram is urgent and cannot be surpassed. The China Yangtze River Leading River Association respectfully.</p>

<h3>Seamen's Party Branch Cables Central Government Requesting Appropriate Increase in National Assembly Representative Quota</h3>
<p>The Special Seamen's Party Branch of China, considering that the national seamen population numbers as many as 800,000, and that the National Assembly representative election law, already stipulated by the Central Government, specifies that professional representatives should account for 35 to 40 percent, yet the allocation of representative slots has overlooked seamen, causing deep consternation, hereby cables the Central Government to request an appropriate increase of several seamen representatives. The original cable is as follows: "To the esteemed Nanjing Central Executive Committee, upon investigation, the National Assembly representative election law has been stipulated by the Central Government, specifying that professional representatives should account for 35 to 40 percent. This aligns perfectly with the spirit and history of our Party's consistent emphasis on professional representation. However, recent reports indicate that the Legislative Yuan's allocation of professional representative slots has overlooked labor groups such as seamen, railways, postal and telecommunications workers, causing great consternation. It is noted that the seamen population numbers 800,000. In the second year of the Republic, the Premier instructed Chen Bingsheng and others to secretly form the Qiao Hai Friendship Association, bringing the Hai Chang into the revolutionary front. This already demonstrates how the revolutionary cause relies on seamen. Subsequently, in terms of transportation, such as carrying out the Hong Kong general strike as ordered, participating in the Northern Expedition's maritime transport work, and striving to fulfill orders during the "January 28th" Incident, there have been numerous other prominent or clandestine efforts to assist the revolution. The Central Government is well aware of these circumstances, hence the separate establishment of the Seamen's Party Branch and trade union to unify leadership. This is because seamen have no fixed abode and are responsible for transportation, so special protection is necessary. Yet, with such a large population, such a glorious history, such a proper nature, and such mobile movements, the National Assembly is not allowing them to have attending representatives. How can this be explained in light of our Party's spirit of protecting seamen since the second year of the Republic, and the Party's hope for the seamen's future support? The situation of the seamen is such, and the other railway, postal, and telecommunications workers are no different from seamen as mobile workers, and should be treated the same. Since they cannot participate in representative elections in any one place, nor can they participate separately based on the provinces and cities they serve via ships and trains, and they certainly cannot return to their original residences to participate based on their service relationships, then we can only request an appropriate increase in the representative quota to be allocated to labor groups such as seamen, railways, postal and telecommunications workers. If the quota cannot be increased appropriately, then the above labor groups should be included in the free professional groups, and the 58 representative slots should be reallocated based on the total number of members in each group, or several slots should be extracted from the total of 98 representative slots for all groups to be reallocated to labor groups such as seamen, railways, and postal and telecommunications workers. The overall goal is to achieve a fair election administration, so that the labor groups do not feel left out. Looking up to the central authorities, we are greatly hoping. Chinese Kuomintang Special Seamen's Party Branch kowtows, deletion and printing."</p>
<h3>Special District Telephone Users Repeatedly Report Inaccurate Metering</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new telephone rates in the Special District, users in various areas have been repeatedly reporting to the Telephone Problem Committee about the company's inaccurate metering, and many are considering having their phones disconnected. A compilation of reports is as follows: The China Mining Company of Fuzhou Road, Fuxing Lane, writes: "We originally disagreed with the Special District's telephone rate increase. Later, it was changed to a three-cent charge based on usage, so we reluctantly complied. However, the phone company's bills are still being charged according to the increased rates, and the usage count is inflated, far exceeding what we can afford. Therefore, we are joining your organization in advocating for refusing to pay and awaiting a resolution." Hanxing Water and Electricity Company at 875 Fuxu Road writes: "The phone rate increase is a move that disregards business difficulties and seeks to monopolize. Users are extremely indignant and unable to afford it, but they are afraid to speak out. We are deeply moved by your organization's great spirit in negotiating with them, hoping to achieve a final goal of seeking liberation for oppressed users. We greatly admire you upon hearing this news. We are unwilling to pay this new phone bill lightly and are waiting for your organization to resolve the matter. In addition to inflated usage counts, the company is further pressing us by strictly demanding payment. We wonder if other users have received similar demands and what their feelings are. Therefore, we are reporting the situation to you and requesting your guidance so that we can follow it." Additionally, Wu Junsheng at 59 Shendeli, Tangshan Road, Yang Binghua at 21 Lane 10, Mintini Yin Road, Ye Residence on Chengdu Road, and others have also written to the committee stating inaccurate metering and requesting disconnection.</p>
<h3>Case of Car Plunging into Huangpu River from Dinghai Island: Three More Bodies Retrieved and Identified; Bodies of Hu Wenyan, Gu Junchen, and Wang Yongkui Identified and Claimed by Families</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of vehicle numbered 6835, a private car, driven by Hu Wenyan, and carrying a total of eight passengers, which plunged into the Huangpu River at Liping Road, Yangshupu, at 3:00 AM on the 12th of this month, resulting in all of them being unfortunately drowned, and the subsequent retrieval of three bodies, which were taken to the corpse inspection office on Fielun Road by the Yangshupu Police Station and reported to the First Special District Court, which dispatched a prosecutor to the scene to confirm the identities and order the families to claim the bodies, as previously reported in the newspapers. Over the past two days, the Lifesaving Bureau retrieved more bodies from the Huangpu River (two yesterday, now known to be three). These bodies have been identified by their families as Hu Wenyan, 23 years old, from Hubei, the driver; Gu Junchen, 40 years old, from Chuansha; and Wang Yongkui, 40 years old, from Gaoqiao. The First Special District Court dispatched prosecutor Song Genshan to the corpse inspection office yesterday morning to inspect the three bodies one by one. It was confirmed that all three had died from drowning before death. The prosecutor ordered the families to provide written guarantees and claim the bodies for burial.</p>

<p>Mr. Bao Yimin from Hefei, Anhui Province, recognizing the uneconomical use of light bulbs, painstakingly researched and sought to reclaim rights and improve construction. After three years, he finally succeeded in inventing a five-function light bulb. Its external appearance is no different from ordinary light bulbs, but the internal filament and bulb base are more complex. When in use, simply rotate the light bulb slightly to emit five different intensities of light and turn them on and off at will. Even if one or two filaments are broken, the bulb can still be used. In essence, one bulb has the usage of five bulbs and the durability of five bulbs. After his success, Mr. Bao applied for a patent from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. After the Ministry examined and approved his application, he was granted a five-year patent. He also received investment and cooperation from Mr. Yu Weiqing from Jiangyin, and a factory has been established at 457 North Henan Road in the city for manufacturing. The goods will be shipped soon, and a press conference will be held to demonstrate this valuable invention by a Chinese.</p>

<h3>Due to Oppression from Wealth and Lust, Four Threw Themselves into the Huangpu River Yesterday and the Day Before; Three Affected by Economic Factors, One Blackmailed by Ruffians</h3>
<p>Between the day before yesterday evening and yesterday, four men threw themselves into the Huangpu River one after another, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, all were rescued. Regarding their motives for seeking death, those who were unemployed and suffering from economic oppression accounted for three of them. After being rescued, they were sent to their homes or charitable organizations for relief by detectives Hu Changqing and Yao Guofa of the Customs Water Police Station. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Yuqing</p>
<p>22 years old, from Ningbo, formerly a peddler, stopped his business due to inability to maintain a livelihood. After returning to Ningbo, he came to Shanghai again on the 12th of this month to visit a friend named Chen, intending to borrow money to survive. However, Chen had moved. When he arrived in Shanghai, he had only sixteen small coins with him, and he also pawned a lined robe, using up all his money. Therefore, at midnight on the day before yesterday, he jumped off the Baidu Bridge outside the Suzhou Creek estuary. After being rescued by the water police, his friend was located and took him away for relief.</p>
<p>Xu Yaoyun</p>
<p>20 years old, from Jiashan, formerly worked in a printing factory. He was laid off and returned home on the 5th of this month. On the 13th, he came to Shanghai to look for work but found nothing. In extreme anger, he threw himself into the Huangpu River in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, at 11:00 AM yesterday. He was rescued by a Dalaixiao tugboat that passed by and sent to the Water Police Station, who contacted his friend Wu Yiren to take him away.</p>
<p>Zhang Shanqing</p>
<p>31 years old, from Ningbo, formerly worked at the Commodities Exchange. He has been unemployed for a long time. He arrived in Shanghai from Wuhu the day before yesterday to look for friends and find work, but he ran out of money. So, at 1:15 PM yesterday, he boarded a Butterfield &amp; Swire ferry at the Yangjingbang and jumped into the river at the center of the river. After being rescued, he was sent to the Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association for relief by the Water Police Station.</p>
<p>Wu Yichang</p>
<p>26 years old, from Wuxi. He became acquainted with a mistress, which led to a divorce from his original wife. Recently, he came to Shanghai to live with his mistress. Unexpectedly, the woman was frivolous and became acquainted with a group of ruffians who threatened and blackmailed Wu. Wu regretted it but could not go back. He also had no face to see his first wife, so he threw himself into the Suzhou Creek at around 2:00 PM yesterday. After being rescued, his younger brother Wu Juhai was contacted by the Water Police Station and persuaded him.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Maritime Accidents: Whereabouts of Hexing Engine Blade Unknown; Qingning Aground in Zigang for Sixteen Days; Huichang Collides with Wharf in Dalian, Mutual Damage</h3>
<p>Hexing Loses Blade and Encounters Danger</p>
<p>The Hexing, a vessel of the Zhaoxing Company in Shanghai, originally sailed in the Northern Seas. On the 13th of this month, the ship loaded a large batch of cargo in Shanghai and set off for Tianjin. On the 16th, at 11:00 AM, the ship was five nautical miles southeast of Houji Island, about one and a half days' journey from Tianjin, located at 120 degrees 42.5 minutes east longitude and 38 degrees 1.5 minutes north latitude. The ship's engine blade suddenly fell into the sea. How it fell is still unknown. However, the ship lost its blade and could not move. It was also carrying a large amount of cargo, drifting on the sea, in a dangerous situation. The shipowner urgently sent a wire requesting assistance. Upon receiving the news, the Shanghai Zhaoxing Company telegraphed the Yuxing vessel in Tianjin to rush to Houji Island to find a way to rescue it and tow it back to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Towing and Rescue of Aground Qingning</p>
<p>The Qingning, a vessel of the Funing Shipping Company in Shanghai, originally loaded salt in Haizhou to transport to the Yangtze River. On the 1st of this month, the vessel loaded 36,000 bags of Huai salt. It ran aground in Zigang due to shallow water after leaving Haizhou. The Fengpei, a vessel of the Sanbei Company, had also run aground in the area (as previously reported in this newspaper). Qingning had run aground earlier. Initially, it was planned to wait for the tide to rise and try to get out of the shallows on its own. Unexpectedly, after waiting for sixteen days, it still could not automatically escape even during high tide. The Shanghai office received a telegram from the vessel yesterday stating that they were planning to send a barge to unload the cargo to reduce the draft and then tow it out of the shallows.</p>
<p>Huichang Vessel Collides with Wharf</p>
<p>The Huichang, a vessel of the Huichang Company, was carrying gasoline from Japan to Dalian. When berthing at the Dongbangou No. 2 Wharf in Dalian Bay, it collided violently with the wharf due to wave action, damaging the wharf. The iron awning of the Huitong vessel was dented, damaging 15 feet, breaking four pillars, and the outer iron plate of the ship was dented, horizontally damaging three feet six inches and occupying eight feet in length. Two keel beams were also damaged. It is currently being repaired in the factory.</p>
<h3>Attempted Murder of Husband - Adulterer Arrested, Adulteress Escaped - Xu Daolin Vehemently Claims Innocence - Zhang Xu Should Be Arrested and Interrogated</h3>
<p>Zhang A'mei, a Pudong native, residing in a bungalow at 456 Sapey Road in the French Concession, a plasterer by trade, aged forty-six. His first wife had passed away. Fourteen years ago, he cohabited with Xu, a woman from the same hometown (this year, forty years old, known as A'mao's mother). Xu Daolin, (twenty-four years old), also from Zhang's hometown and working in the same trade, rented a room in Zhang's house. Little did Zhang know that Zhang Xu, nearing fifty, still harbored youthful passions. Disliking Zhang's age, Xu Daolin slightly seduced her, and they became illicit lovers, engaging in secret affairs more than once. Zhang remained oblivious. Xu and Xu's adulterous affair intensified, leading to thoughts of murder. On the 21st of last month, around 10 PM, the two attempted to harm Zhang using a treacherous scheme. While Zhang was sitting on the toilet, defecating, Xu first poured boiling water on Zhang's head unexpectedly. Zhang, scalded by the heat, fell to the ground unconscious. Xu Daolin then grabbed a kitchen knife and repeatedly slashed Zhang A'mei's head twice, also severing a section of his right thumb. Zhang cried out for help, and Xu and Xu fled the scene. Neighbors reported this to the French police station, who dispatched detectives to transport Zhang to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Later, the culprit Xu Daolin was apprehended and sent to the Second Special District Court. Because the victim's injuries had not yet healed and Xu was still at large, an order was issued to detain Xu and investigate further. Now that the injured victim Zhang A'mei's injuries have slightly improved, yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special District Court presided over the interrogation in the first criminal court. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case, indicting Xu under Article 271 of the Criminal Law for attempted murder. Subsequently, the victim Zhang A'mei testified about the circumstances of the attack, and the witness Gu Xiaomei testified about hearing cries for help at the time. When questioned, Xu Daolin denied everything and vehemently claimed innocence. After reviewing the testimonies, the court adjourned the hearing to the 23rd for further questioning, ordering the victim to have his injuries examined at the French Hospital and instructing the investigating officers to make every effort to arrest the fugitive Zhang Xu, and also summoning the victim Zhang A'mei's daughter-in-law to court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Secret Brothel Set Up by Russian Nationals - Raided and Prosecuted - Obscene Acts Too Horrifying to Behold - Thorough Investigation to Uncover Truth and Bring Justice</h3>
<p>Room number five in the Western-style house at 12 Kunshan Garden in Hongkou was a secret brothel. Those in charge were Russian men and women who hired shameless Chinese to participate in obscene acts. The performances were quite varied, including active erotic displays, nude dancing, and acts of mutual masturbation, all designed to attract lecherous men. As a result, day and night, a stream of patrons flocked to the place. The brothel owners set prices, and customers could specify which programs they wanted to see. After paying the fee, the men and women would begin their performance. Recently, Deputy Detective Zhu Jihuang and Tao Genrong of the Hongkou police station discovered this and deemed it necessary to shut it down. On the 12th, they went undercover to investigate, spending dozens of gold coins to witness the secret performances in detail. Yesterday, they returned and arrested Russian nationals Ai Nuoluo Fupi Jiade, Russian woman Paige Beiduoge Wu, and four others, as well as Luo Yuxi, a man from Yangzhou. They also seized several obscene items. The detective also recovered six five-yuan bills, which were the marked bills he gave as payment the other day. They were taken back to the police station, detained separately, and sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution under Article 234 of the Criminal Law. However, due to the case involving offenses against public morals, the hearing was closed to the public. It is reported that after a preliminary hearing by the court judge, an order was issued for detention, pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Another Robbery and Assault Occurred on Xin Kai River and Danfeng Road - Clerk from Siming Bank Shot - Sent to Hospital, Still in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>Around 10 AM yesterday, Siming Bank dispatched clerk Xie Shaofa to deliver 2,400 yuan in legal tender to a certain business within the city. However, while traveling along Xin Kai River and Danfeng Road, he was suddenly encountered by two robbers posing as public officials. Xie, seeing through their disguise, immediately blew his police whistle. The robbers panicked and only managed to steal a ledger. Fortunately, the money was hidden in his pocket and was not lost. However, as the robbers fled, they fired a single shot, which struck Xie Shaofa's right chest, next to his nipple. Police arrived and immediately transported him to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. It is reported that he is still in critical condition. The Yimiao Police Station officers have been dispatched to search for the bandits, but they have disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h3>Fire at Lai Yi Ferry in Pudong - Lumberyard Suffers Loss of 2,000 Yuan - Director Zhang Prevents Arson</h3>
<p>A lumberyard owned by Ma Yanhai from Nanhui, located at 142 Dong Yangjiazhai Road behind the Lai Yi Ferry Youth Association in Pudong, suddenly caught fire at 12:10 AM yesterday. The fire started in a pile of reeds in front of the shop. By the time the shopkeepers discovered it, it had already spread rapidly. They immediately tried to extinguish it with water, but the fire was too fierce to control. Director Zhao of the Pudong Fire Brigade led his team in a vehicle to the scene to help. Soon after, a fire truck from the Yangjing District also arrived to assist. However, the fire intensified, quickly spreading to nearby piles of lumber. The flames rose high into the sky. Despite the efforts of the firefighters to pour water, it was ineffective. After burning for about an hour, the reeds, valued at 2,000 silver dollars, were completely reduced to ashes. The fire also spread to two shop buildings with reed roofs, causing a loss of 60 to 70 yuan. Fortunately, the fire did not spread to neighboring buildings, and the fire gradually subsided. Afterward, Director Zhang Wuqin of the Pudong Branch ordered the fire victim Ma Yanhai to be brought to the bureau for questioning about the cause of the fire, but no leads were found. Director Zhang believed that because four or five lumberyards in the surrounding area had been subjected to fire in succession since last winter, simply attributing this to carelessness was not believable. There may be someone who hates lumberyards and is secretly committing arson, which is worth investigating. Therefore, he instructed his subordinates to pay more attention to the lumberyards that have not yet been targeted.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement - Cracking Down on Dance Schools - Fines Imposed - Repeat Offenses Will Result in Closure</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, citing the recent proliferation of dance schools within the Settlement, which hold disguised dances at night that are no different from Western-style dance halls but fail to pay the required fees, has ordered a crackdown. Previously, Xin Dalu, Xiangsheng, and the Far East Women's Travel Agency were prosecuted in court and fined. Now, Chief Chinese Constable Lu Dagong of the Laozha Police Station has discovered that seven Chinese dance schools, including Le Xiang at 161 Fujian Road, Lidu at 436 Hankou Road, floors above at 430 Zhejiang Road, rooms 220, 319, 309 of Yao Hua Jiang, Hao Le at 660 Xin Xin/Zhongyang/Aiduya Road, and Ye Lai Xiang at 12 Xizang Road, all sell dance tickets without a license. After investigating and confirming these facts, he filed lawsuits with the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Wu Yinbo, the manager of Le Xiang, Yin Xiangxun of Lidu, Li Daichen of Xin Xin, Wang Baoqing of Zhongyang, Guo Zhechen of Hao Le, and Zhang Shaopeng of Ye Lai Xiang were summoned to the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Special District. After questioning by Judge Shen, the court ruled that Zhongyang, Xin Xin, and Hao Le would each be fined nine yuan, while Le Xiang, Lidu, and Ye Lai Xiang would each be fined eight yuan. They were also warned that repeat offenses would result in closure. Tan Zhixiong, the manager of Tao Hua Hong, failed to appear, and the court ordered a new summons to be issued for him to attend a hearing on another day.</p>
<h3>Xue Sheng's Identity Lawsuit - Pending Blood Test by Forensic Doctor - Wang Qinhua and Luo Sen - Cohabitation Without Responsibility</h3>
<p>Luo Sen, a Siyang native and owner of the Sen Sen Chemical Factory at 17 Tailai Lane, Maigen Road, previously cohabited with Wang Qinhua, a Changzhou native, at 64 Baoxing Lane, Baoxing Road, Zhabei. Last year, on Lunar New Year's Eve, during a heavy snowfall, Wang gave birth to a son named Xue Sheng. After the birth, Luo abandoned Wang. Now, because Luo refuses to acknowledge Xue Sheng's identity, Wang, as Xue Sheng's legal representative, has filed a lawsuit against Luo to confirm his identity. The First Special District Court has already held one hearing. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu held another hearing. Because the two sides are in dispute over Xue Sheng's identity, the court adjourned the hearing to allow for a blood test to be conducted by the forensic institute in Zhenru.</p>
<h3>Robber Liu Ronghua - Sentenced to Seven Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Robber Liu Ronghua (42 years old, Shandong native) recently came to Shanghai from Qingdao with his accomplice Jia Guizhang (29 years old, also from Shandong). Only three days after arriving, on the 5th of this month, at 8 PM, they went armed to Cao Xiangtai Cotton Cloth Shop at 276 Avenue Edward VII to rob the store. They obtained eleven yuan. As they left the store, they split up and fled. The owner gave chase and called for help. Jia fired his gun along the way, resisting arrest. Constable No. 824 of the French Police chased them to Yuegui Lane, Fujian Road, in the Public Concession, where he returned fire, killing Jia. A pistol and three bullets were found on Jia. The police also recovered all the stolen money. Liu fled into No. 4 Dongxin Lane, Maidian Road, where Constable No. 380 of the French Police chased him down and arrested him. He was taken to the police station, handed over to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The police reported Jia's death to the court for verification, and the body was handled by the mortuary. All the details have been published in this newspaper. It is now learned that the French Police Department has concluded its investigation, filed charges according to law, and Judge Zhang Chaozuo has concluded the trial. Yesterday morning, at 10 AM, Judge Zhang presided over the sentencing in the First Criminal Court, sentencing Liu Ronghua to seven years of imprisonment for armed robbery and depriving him of his civil rights for seven years. The pistol and three bullets were confiscated. During the appeal period, the defendant will be held in the detention center.</p>
<h3>Chinese Inventors' Association - Calling for a Meeting of Founding Members</h3>
<p>The Chinese Inventors' Association, initiated by industrialists Yu Binqi, Fang Yaoting, Lin Zeren, Yao Tingchun, and others, has received a very enthusiastic response from potential founders. A certain industrialist has also offered to help with the initial operating expenses, making the future prospects quite optimistic. It is reported that the association has sent out more than 60 letters to inventors who have obtained patent certificates from the Ministry of Industry, announcing that a meeting of founding members will be held at 3 PM on the 17th, at 622 Zhoujiazui Road, Shanghai. Inventors who hold patent certificates and wish to be listed as founding members are urged to attend the meeting to discuss the way forward.</p>
<h3>20 Wei Lu'an's Appeal Against Municipal Tax Rejected</h3>
<p>The dispute involving Cantonese lawyer Gan Weilu, who was in arrears for municipal taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council, was previously ruled against Gan Weilu by the First Special District Court on January 22. He was ordered to pay the Shanghai Municipal Council a total of 239.40 yuan. Gan appealed against this ruling. It is now reported that the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has recently ruled to uphold the original verdict and reject the appeal. Gan's appeal argued that since the people have an obligation to pay taxes, they should also enjoy the right to vote. Now that the Municipal Council is collecting taxes from Chinese residents within the Settlement, but does not allow Chinese to attend the annual taxpayers' meeting, this is unfair. Therefore, before the Chinese obtain rights equal to their obligations, they can refuse to pay taxes. However, the legal point in contention in this case is only whether the appellant has an obligation to pay taxes, and not whether the Chinese can attend the taxpayers' annual meeting. The Municipal Council's right to collect taxes is based on the Land Regulations, while the Chinese's ability or inability to attend the annual meeting is a political issue and should be resolved through other channels. The appellant cannot refuse to pay taxes on the grounds that voting rights have not yet reached equality. Therefore, the High Court considers that the original verdict of the First Instance was not inappropriate.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Announces - Isolation Periods for Infectious Diseases</h3>

<h3>Lili Company Distributes Wenzhou Rice Wine</h3>
<p>Rice wine is a specialty of Wenzhou. Connoisseurs in the interior love it like life. It's a pity that the annual production is not enough to sell well everywhere, which is a shame. Recently, it has been learned that Mr. Dong Qingsheng and Zhang Yanling of Wenzhou Datong Trading Company, 18 Daguo Road, Wenzhou, in view of this, have established a Meigang Winery to expand production using scientific new methods and sell it to other cities to benefit all. According to them, rice wine is the original juice of a kind of yellow wine, distilled, containing a rich nutrient component, so the nature is also strong. Drinking it seems stimulating, and after a while it can invigorate the spirit. Its functions include dispelling wind, regulating dampness, resolving filth, expelling evil, strengthening bones, strengthening muscles, adding essence, benefiting marrow, avoiding mountain and miasma obstructions, as well as the four unhealthy elements. Giving it as a gift to relatives and friends, or entertaining guests, is all appropriate. It is truly a superior treasure for traveling at home. The distribution point is Wenzhou Datong Trading Company, and the local distributor is Lili Native Products Company at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Tianjin Road. Mr. Dong and Zhang are now carrying a large batch of goods and are staying at Southeast Hotel at No. 8 Wharf in the South City. If you want to purchase wholesale, you can go there to contact them.</p>
<h3>Pre-Order Sales for Chinese Medical Encyclopedia</h3>
<p>Mr. Cao Bingzhang of Siming is a renowned scholar of traditional Chinese medicine. He was hired by the Great East Book Company to compile the Chinese Medical Encyclopedia, drawing on his decades of experience reading extensively and spending three years of effort. He collected famous works from ancient and modern times, added annotations, deletions, and revisions, classified them into thirteen categories, totaling 365 types. Before the book was completed, a catalog was printed to solicit opinions from famous doctors across the country. Over six months, thousands of letters were received, and he revised and added to it based on the opinions of each family, which is incomparable to those who are cursory. The book is now on pre-order sale. All one thousand books have a uniform format, printed in Southern Song style, carefully proofread. Those who pay in full in advance will receive a current selling price of ninety yuan, and there is also an installment payment method. Those who pre-order before June 30 will receive three famous works of medical cases and medical prescriptions for free. If you want to know the content, you can first purchase a copy of the book's table of contents and synopsis. On the first day of pre-order sales of this book, nearly a thousand people purchased and read the synopsis, which shows that the book has won the belief of those who study traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, in recent days, the number of letters and personal reservations has been overwhelming. This book indeed has three major characteristics. Speaking shallowly, it can enable medical students to gain access to the path; speaking deeply, it can enable medical experts to carefully refer to it, tracing the source from the flow, so as to reach the state of broad to simple. The especially good thing is that there are no sectors that are not prepared, no books that are not exquisite. Now the National Government has promulgated regulations on traditional Chinese medicine, and the practice of traditional Chinese medicine has considerable guarantees. I hope that my colleagues in the Chinese medical community will purchase and read this book in the spirit of research, so as to be able to use the wonderful effects of adaptability.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Our worker, Wang Rongfu, a native of Ningbo, 25 years old, is honest and sincere and has never engaged in any misconduct. This can be proven by all the shops where Wang Rongfu has worked. On the evening of April 21st of this year, after finishing dinner on Xibaoxing Road in Zhabei, while returning to the factory, he passed the entrance of the Sande Teahouse on Sanyang Road when he suddenly heard gunshots. He ran to escape, but someone chased after him and, without discrimination, shot Wang Rongfu in the leg multiple times, firing as many as five shots. He collapsed to the ground and was taken to the Charity Hospital for treatment. Whether Wang Rongfu is a robber or has any criminal liability should be determined by the court. We will not elaborate here. However, the reason Wang Rongfu sought death was because he was innocently shot and then accused of robbery, so he chose to end his life. The report in your newspaper that he committed suicide out of fear of punishment and that Wang Rongfu was a native of Funing are both inconsistent with the facts. We are writing to request that you investigate and correct the record to set the matter straight. Sincerely, American Laundry, Sanyang Road, Xibaoxing Road, Zhabei, May 15th.</p>
<p>We have seen in your newspaper that Fuchang Ginseng Shop was robbed a few days ago, and a number of diamond ornaments and a self-defense pistol were stolen. However, our shop is a business; how could we have any diamond ornaments in our possession? Nor do we have a self-defense pistol. It was the Xu residence inside Xiaodongmen that was burglarized, and it was not our shop. We believe your newspaper's report is inaccurate. We urge you to promptly correct the record to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Fuchang Ginseng Shop, No. 83 Xian'gua Street, Nanshi, Shanghai, May 16th.</p>
<h3>The Pioneer of China's Wood Dry Distillation Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhou Rong</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Jiangnan Chemical Industry Manufacturing Plant</p>
<p>I. Introduction: In terms of the chemical industry itself, wood dry distillation is second in importance only to the production of the three acids. In China's current situation, its significance and necessity are particularly profound. The products of wood dry distillation are all direct or indirect raw materials for industry. Taking acetic acid as an example, in Shanghai alone, the amount used by printing and dyeing factories reaches over two million pounds per year. Other products such as wood alcohol for medicine, wood tar for coatings, and charcoal for household use are also consumed in large quantities. It is safe to say that as industry progresses in the future, the demand will increase even more drastically. Furthermore, according to research by European and American chemists, finely refined dry distillation semi-finished products can yield more than thirty kinds of products. The most important are acetone (CH3COCH3), formaldehyde (HCHO), benzene (C6H6), carbolic acid, and creosote, all of which are essential chemicals or pharmaceuticals. As for the raw material, firewood, it only needs to be solid and have abundant fibers, such as trees like elm, oak, and Quercus fabri. Even thin, crooked pieces that cannot be made into useful objects are very suitable. These trees are easy to grow and abundant in China's undeveloped mountainous areas. The annual output in areas like Huzhou, Zhejiang, alone is around one million dan. Other provinces such as the Northeast, Anhui, Hubei, Yunnan, and Guangxi have even greater potential. It is a pity that they have not been utilized and are usually only used as firewood, as if they were waste. If they could be applied to industry, it would greatly benefit rural areas. The Jiangnan Chemical Industry Manufacturing Plant is the first and only wood dry distillation plant in China, and its future prospects are limitless.</p>
<p>II. Brief History of the Factory: The factory was prepared and established in the summer of 1933. The factory site is located at the intersection of Gonghe Xin Road and Liuying Road in Zhabei. It was initially founded by Xu Shixing and Ge Guitang of the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company, who hired Mr. Wu Haoran as the engineer to install the machinery. After several trials, acetic acid was first produced in June 1934. However, due to the simple equipment and insufficient degree of refinement, it was difficult to sell. They then consulted Dr. Xue Jiming for ways to improve the situation. After observing the results, Dr. Xue believed that the existing equipment was insufficient to supply industrial manufacturing and that it was necessary to raise additional capital to design a new factory. Xu and Ge followed his advice and gave up their own capital, adding new shares in the name of the initiators. At that time, Mr. Shen Zhongyi and others, feeling the importance of the wood dry distillation industry, resolutely joined in. The factory design was the responsibility of Dr. Xue, who ordered machinery from both domestic and foreign sources. By early 1935, Zhao Cichen, Zhao Yechen, and others provided additional support and joined. In April of the same year, the capital was fully subscribed. In mid-June, the machinery installation was completed. In September, acetic acid, wood alcohol, wood tar, and other products were officially sold wholesale. The quality was pure and excellent, comparable to imported products. Therefore, since its launch, sales have been very strong. In summary, it took the factory two years to prepare, from preparation to launch, and many reforms before it was successfully completed. The difficulty of pioneering basic industry is evident.</p>
<p>III. Manufacturing Process: (A) Raw Materials: The factory's raw materials, except for firewood, which is purchased from the Huzhou area of Zhejiang, sulfuric acid is supplied by the Kaicheng Acid Factory. Because the two parties have a mutual assistance agreement, the price is particularly low. Lime and coal are purchased locally from merchants in this city and are all domestic products.</p>
<p>(B) Dry Distillation: The dry distillation department has a self-built German Meyer Hannover Horizontal Type dry distillation stove and four parallel dry distillation retorts. The retort surface is equipped with four coolers. A railway is laid in the middle for the entry and exit of the firewood carts. Each dry distillation retort can hold three firewood carts. After the firewood carts enter the retort, the lid is tightly sealed, and coal is burned under the stove. After about ten hours, the wood in the retort evaporates due to the heat, forming a gas that rises through the flue, passing through the wood tar separator. The oil sinks due to its weight and is released as crude wood tar. The remaining gas rises and is drawn into the cooling tower by a suction machine. Cold water circulates in the tower, turning the gas into a liquid, which enters the pyroligneous acid tank. A portion of the non-liquefiable, combustible residual gas is returned to the dry distillation stove for combustion. If there is a surplus, it is discharged into the air through a duct.</p>
<p>(C) Neutralization: The pyroligneous acid in the tank is pumped into the neutralization tanks upstairs. There are five neutralization tanks, and an appropriate amount of lime is added to neutralize it, and it is mixed evenly with a mixer for six hours. Then, it is pumped into the sedimentation tanks on the opposite side. The sedimentation tank has two functions: to allow the wood tar impurities in the neutralization liquid to sink, preventing them from mixing into the subsequent wood alcohol and calcium acetate. This is the first function. The second function is to fully complete the incomplete neutralization process. The sedimentation time is about one day and night, and then it is placed in the wood alcohol crude processing machine.</p>
<p>(D) Wood Alcohol Distillation: There are two wood alcohol crude processing machines, which are simple distillation apparatuses. Heat is taken from steam, using the different boiling points (the boiling point of wood alcohol is 660C, and the boiling point of acetic acid is 1180C). Wood alcohol first vaporizes and exits, and after passing through the cooling pipe, it condenses into a liquid, resulting in a greenish-yellow crude wood alcohol. Crude wood alcohol is added with an appropriate amount of sulfuric acid and then distilled once more in a wood alcohol refining machine to obtain clear and pure wood alcohol.</p>
<p>(E) Decomposition: The calcium acetate solution remaining in the wood alcohol crude processing machine must first be concentrated by a concentrator to remove a large amount of water. The concentrator is a double-effect evaporator, which uses the different pressures of each effect to increase the efficiency of evaporation. After the calcium acetate solution is concentrated, it is then dried in a double-shaft dryer and a baking plate. The dried, brownish-gray calcium acetate is then sent to the decomposition machine. There are two decomposition machines, equipped with stirrers and vacuum machines. First, the calcium acetate and sulfuric acid components are proportioned, and then they are placed in the decomposition machine according to law and steamed. At the same time, the stirrer is kept running, and the vacuum machine is used to accelerate the decomposition. The crude acetic acid is then guided and flows out.</p>
<p>(F) Acetic Acid Distillation: The crude acetic acid obtained earlier contains a lot of water and impurities, so it must be further refined in a re-processing machine. The structure and principle of the re-processing machine are the same as that of the wood alcohol refining machine, but the boiling point of acetic acid is higher than that of water. Therefore, the first liquid to be distilled out is a very dilute acetic acid. When the temperature reaches the boiling point of acetic acid, a concentrated acetic acid solution of over 90% can be obtained. Finally, it is distilled in an acetic acid refining machine to produce glacial acetic acid of over 98%.</p>
<p>IV. Production and Sales: The factory currently produces four types of products: acetic acid, wood alcohol, wood tar, and charcoal. The daily output of acetic acid is 60 units, with excellent quality and a composition of over 98%. It is all purchased and used by printing and dyeing and paint factories in this city and other cities. Wood alcohol is used to make denatured alcohol, creosote (for disinfection and bakelite raw materials), collodion, and pharmaceutical raw materials. The daily output is 700 pounds, with a composition of 97%, comparable to imported products. It is currently distributed by Lianshun Company and is well-received by the outside world. Wood tar is an excellent anti-corrosion and anti-rust coating. Charcoal is used for household fuel. The former has a daily production of 6,000 pounds, and the latter can produce 130 dan. They are distributed by Shengda Paint Shop and Qingda Coal Company, respectively, and sales are booming.</p>
<p>V. Development Plan: The factory's future development plan is to enrich the engineering equipment, increase production, and strive for better quality. It also plans to extract acetone, creosote, etc., to supply the needs of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, it will also start extracting formalin from wood alcohol to produce bakelite powder, acetic acid to produce aspirin and high-grade acetic acid, and charcoal to refine activated carbon. These are all in the research plan. When all of them are successful in the future, it will be a shining achievement for the national goods industry and will not only plug huge loopholes in finances.

<h3>National Educational Toy Exhibition Opens This Morning; Thirteen-Day Exhibition Features 7,922 Items</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 16th Dispatch) Preparations for the National Children's Educational Toy Exhibition have been completed. It is scheduled to open at the National Products Exhibition Hall on the morning of the 17th, with an exhibition period of thirteen days. At 7:30 AM on the 17th, after Mrs. Wang, the Minister of Education's wife, cuts the ribbon, representatives from various organizations and individuals will be invited to visit. Other days are designated for individual or group visits. The collected exhibits, according to statistics, include 3,726 educational tools, with natural sciences being the most numerous, followed by manual arts, and then arithmetic and kindergarten items being the least. The toy section has 4,496 items, with animals being the most numerous, followed by furniture, and then national defense toy decorations being the least. The producing provinces and cities include twenty-one provinces and cities such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Fujian, Guangxi, Chahar, Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Weihai, Tianjin, Pingjin, and Hankou, with Beijing having the most and Shanxi having the fewest. Among foreign toys, Japanese toys are the most numerous, and British toys are the fewest. All exhibits are arranged by type and function, divided into eight rooms, to facilitate quality comparison.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Event: National Children's Year Implementation Committee</p>
<p>The National Children's Educational Toy Exhibition, after a long period of preparation, has opened on a large scale in the capital.</p>
<p>Although there have been exhibitions of educational tools in various places before, they were not large in scale. The Ministry of Education in Beijing held an exhibition of toys in the early years of the Republic of China, but it was also very simple. This exhibition will last for ten days, from May 17th to May 26th, 1936. There are more than 20,000 exhibits from various sources, including self-made items from national primary schools, imitations and creations from factories and shops, and reference items sent from the Soviet Union, Japan, and European and American countries. They are of all shapes and colors, with many valuable items. Compared to the educational tools and toys of twenty years ago, there is a world of difference. In our country, this can be said to be an unprecedented grand event. What is the significance of holding such a grand event at the cost of "mobilizing the masses?" We believe that—</p>
<p>Educational tools are the sharpest weapons for teaching. To improve the efficiency of teaching, it is necessary to equip and improve educational tools. "A workman must first sharpen his tools if he wants to do his job well" is a definite truth. Without nets, you cannot hunt; without plows, you cannot farm; without hand tools, there is no handicraft industry; without machines, there is no mechanical industry... This is a very obvious historical fact. Similarly, the relationship between educational tools and teaching is also very significant. Without instruments and specimens, you cannot teach natural sciences; without work tools, you cannot teach manual labor... Even if you have them all, but they are not suitable or economical, the efficiency of teaching will be reduced. Therefore, educational tools are necessities for teaching and should be enriched and improved. They are very important in teaching.</p>
<p>Toys are treasures that enrich children's lives, expand their intelligence and interests. To allow children's impulses and abilities to develop properly, toys must be given to them, and giving them toys with educational value is indispensable. Humans are animals who love to play and move. Adults enjoy traveling, composing poetry, appreciating art, and engaging in sports... Each person follows their inclinations, plays, and stays active, thus creating a meaningful world. Modern civilization is, in fact, a product of human play and movement. Children's love of playing and moving is similar to that of adults. Because their bodies and minds are developing, their love of playing and moving may be more pronounced than that of adults in terms of form. Adults have occupations, but children do not. Adults have a wider range and more opportunities to play and move, while children, apart from jumping and shouting in the streets and villages, have few opportunities to play and move. If there are no toys for them to play with, how can children "make a living?" If there are no toys with educational value for them to play with, how can they increase their wisdom and not be addicted to playing? Therefore, toys are necessities for children and should be enriched and improved for the benefit of children. They also occupy an extremely important position in education.</p>
<p>Because both educational tools and toys are important, this association is holding this exhibition during this Children's Year. The purpose is nothing more than the following three points:</p>
<p>To arouse the attention of the public to educational tools and toys. We feel that the people of our country have too little regard for educational tools and toys, so our primary school teaching is mostly rote learning and rote reading. Even natural and manual labor classes are often "armchair exercises," with very few practical experiments and operations. Most of our children are idle, wandering around, or aimlessly shouting and jumping, or they are as stupid as deer and pigs, without any cleverness or liveliness. We are solemnly opening this grand exhibition, displaying educational tools and toys from all over the country and reference items from foreign countries separately for exhibition. We hope that after the exhibition, everyone will feel the importance of educational tools and toys and pay close attention to them. From now on, schools will use educational tools as sharp weapons, and families will regard toys as treasures, no longer considering them insignificant as before.</p>
<p>To encourage the imitation and creation of educational tools and toys. We feel that our educational tools and toys have been imitated and created a lot in the past twenty years due to the efforts of schools and factories, which is a great improvement compared to the past. However, foreign products still fill our markets, and our schools and families still use a large number of foreign products. This shows that our educational tools and toys cannot surpass foreign educational tools and toys. Or, although our educational tools and toys have made great progress, foreign educational tools and toys have made even more progress. Or, although our educational tools and toys can be on par with or even surpass foreign educational tools and toys, they are scattered in various parts of the country, and due to economic and environmental reasons, they cannot compete for the market and are not as accessible in the market as foreign products. This exhibition brings together the best of the country in one place, and there are also many new foreign products on display for reference. We hope that schools and factories will work harder after the exhibition, learn from the strengths of others, imitate them in large quantities, or refer to other people's products, innovate, and create new things, so that the manufacturing of our country's educational tools and toys will be more advanced than before, and promote them in an organized manner to the national market for schools and families to adopt, or even sell them abroad to compete with other countries in the world.</p>
<p>To seek the improvement of educational tools and toys. We believe that educational tools and toys should always be constantly improved. Manufacturers should manufacture excellent products, and users should also choose carefully and only take excellent products. Manufacturers in our country may not know what is excellent and only know how to manufacture blindly, so the quality of products varies, and good and bad are mixed, making it "difficult to recognize the goods when you go out." Users often only look at the form and do not ask about the function, and they are equipped casually, which is very dangerous in terms of children's education. This exhibition displays our country's original educational tools and toys together with newly emerging educational tools and toys from our country and other countries, and many experts are invited to evaluate and reward excellent products. We hope that manufacturers and users will have at least a concept of what is excellent after this exhibition, and in the future, they will be able to manufacture or adopt excellent educational tools and toys, so that educational tools and toys will be more refined, schools will use them to improve teaching effectiveness, and children will play with them to generate more interest and increase wisdom.</p>
<p>This exhibition has received the support of all parties and has been actively exhibited, and we are very grateful. Foreign countries, especially Soviet Russia and Japan, have also sincerely sent things for our reference, and we should express our gratitude even more. We are currently preparing to set up a Central Children's Education Museum. After the exhibition, we will treasure the exhibits (except for those that are returned) and transfer them to the Central Children's Education Museum for long-term display after it is established, hoping that it will not disappoint the hard work of the exhibitors. We would also like to thank the various organizations and individuals who participated in the preparation, who have always done their best for the exhibition.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that people from the capital will come to the exhibition to visit, criticize, and give guidance, and we will be very welcome and honored.</p>

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Appears Strong Outside, Weak Inside</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a slight decline due to environmental stimulation, and the market was stagnant. Transactions also decreased sharply, but the large bull investors were still looking for a way out. It was a Saturday, and the trading floor was narrow. Bull investors were frequently lacking opponents. The situation clearly had the appearance of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. After the rumor of borrowing money was confirmed to be false, the smuggling situation expanded and became more serious, and customs duties have been greatly affected. Although the trading floor has temporarily calmed down, the walls on both sides are still high, and it will inevitably shake in the short term. The bull investors in Sichuan have millions in positions that are floating and unreal. This month has few days left, so numbers 11, 35, etc., are slowly coming out, and the bulls have increased their chips after being deceived by rumors of borrowing money, and they feel that the accumulation is too heavy to reverse. Doing more is really not the time. Yesterday, the market opened in the morning and continued to fall by 0.1 to 0.4 yuan, and most of the selling came from numbers 11 and 35. Number 11 had a lot of buying. The selling pressure at the settlement was slightly reduced, and retail investors had a lot of buying interest. Number 11 bought again, and rose by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan, but the distant contracts felt weaker than the recent contracts. In the afternoon, the market opened, initially continuing to rise by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, but it still felt unable to rally, and the distant contracts for both Type A and Type C had an inverted shape. Trading at the closing was extremely light. There were no trades in Type D, and the rest had highs and lows, and most of them were swap transactions. As a result, except for Type B, which was uniquely good by 0.1 and 0.35 yuan, the rest were small by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The total number of transactions was 4.56 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Flowers: After a Shock, Yarn Flowers Return to Calm; Rumors Subside, People's Hearts Settle; Cotton is Still More Expensive than Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market, after consecutive days of stormy weather, has temporarily returned to calm. This is because rumors in the market have subsided, and the authorities have issued concrete statements on the Sino-American currency agreement issue, leading to stability in people's hearts. Trading volume in the market has decreased significantly, with both bullish and bearish sides adopting a wait-and-see attitude. However, there has been no movement in the amount absorbed by major players, making it difficult to predict future changes.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Tables Show Slight Laxity: At the opening of the spot yarn market, near-term prices fell slightly by 0.2367 yuan. However, when auctioned to distant terms, due to the bullish side remaining silent, prices rose slightly by 0.23 yuan. After the second session, the trend became exceptionally calm, a stark contrast to the previous day's sharp and exposed demeanor. This is indeed due to the subsiding of rumors and the relative stability of market sentiment.

<p>Cotton Market Calm, Due to Subsiding Rumors and Slightly Settled Hearts, But the Trend is More Expensive Than the Yarn Market, Because the Indian and American Cotton Markets Have Improved, and the Talk of Receiving Goods This Month Has Not Ceased. At the Same Time, Japanese Merchants Are Diligently Purchasing Spot Cotton, But Buyers Are Not as Crowded as Before. However, the旺旺筹码 of成交筹码 is said to have created a new record since the establishment of the Exchange.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Flowers Show Weariness with Firmness: At the opening of the spot cotton flower market, due to mediocre American cotton, prices rose and fell interchangeably.

Trading in the market was less active, resulting in a lack of changes. As a result, prices for each month rose by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price.

<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sales Are Also Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton market, due to the yarn and cotton flower storm having calmed down, the market turned clear. Spot sales failed to move forward, and the industry took a cold, observant attitude. The first batch of internal and external factory "Four Gentlemen" serge was opened by the trade for over 100 boxes, priced at 0.215 yuan. The second batch asked for 0.2175 yuan. The northern Shandong merchant group entered 30-50 boxes at most. The Tianjin merchant group slightly entered 20 bales of Dasheng 16-pound Double Dragon coarse cloth, priced at 8.45 yuan. Qingfeng 16-pound Double Fish Jiqing coarse cloth was entered for a total of over 50 bales in the past two days, priced at 8.35 yuan, up by 0.025 yuan. 16-pound Five Blessing coarse cloth on the market has been continuously purchased by this street for 50-60 bales.

<h3>Grains: Major Players Pushing Up, June Futures Increase the Most</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, the market for each month showed a trend of fatigue followed by stability, as the ocean reported prices for Chicago good by about 0.12 yuan and Canada good by 0.04 to 0.1 yuan.

<h3>New Wheat is Still Far Away, Both Buyers and Sellers of Futures are Watching</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures, in the morning chart, the market for each month showed a state of silence. Although the weather is gradually clearing, the new wheat season is still far away. Therefore, both internal and external buyers and sellers turned to wait and see, and due to inconsistent currency rumors, customers throwing goods, and many suspensions, the trend was tired, but the decline was only 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. At the opening in the afternoon, trading in each month was not smooth, and prices hovered. Only after the new wheat is grasped can the market have a formal development. In the spot wheat market, the factory side, due to weak flour sales, had very little intention to enter, so particularly high-quality goods were subject to price cuts. For example, Nansu Zhou Bengbu wheat has fallen to 4.63 yuan and is only trading at 500-600 bags, which are being handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>American Wheat Market: The market is slightly stable due to stable factory markets and poor overseas crop reports, but there is probably no hope of a major rise in the short term.</p>

<h3>Travel and Research the Natural World</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>When we travel, in addition to appreciating the scenery of the natural world, we must also pay attention to studying the knowledge of the natural world. Because the natural world is so vast, it contains extremely valuable knowledge everywhere. The ancients said; "Fallen flowers on the water surface are all essays," which is what this means.</p>
<p>In our natural science class, we may have studied peach blossoms, but before you have seen peach blossoms, your knowledge of peach blossoms is not practical. Contact with the natural world can not only confirm the knowledge you have already acquired, but also discover many new and interesting knowledge!</p>
<p>The natural world is the most complete school in the world. The breadth, perfection, novelty, and interest of the curriculum cannot be compared to any school. And the knowledge of the natural world is the most practical and useful, which no book can compare.</p>
<p>A foreign scholar said: "When you are walking in the countryside, open your eyes." Why do we have to open our eyes? It is to call us to carefully study all the phenomena of the natural world!</p>
<p>Children, traveling and playing in the mountains and rivers can cultivate our temperament, but don't forget to study this kaleidoscope-like natural world.</p>
<h3>Traitor Qin Hui</h3>
<p>— Hong Shijing</p>
<p>Children, you should have seen the story of Yue Fei in the book, right? When the loyal Yue Fei was desperately resisting Jin Wushu, Qin Hui actually accepted Jin Wushu's bribes and willingly became a traitor to the country. In the name of the emperor, he used twelve gold medals to summon Yue Fei back to the capital from the front line and killed him.</p>
<p>Children, why did Qin Hui accept Jin Wushu's bribes and willingly become a traitor? His only hope was nothing more than to be a nominal puppet emperor under the protection of the Jin people. Jin Wushu used Qin Hui for nothing more than to play a puppet show, with the purpose of swallowing China. Qin Hui disregarded his own motherland, and was willing to harm the loyal and brave Yue Fei, to curry favor with the enemy, show off his skills, and be a tool for promotion and fortune. Do you think it is hateful?</p>
<p>Wasn't Yue Fei's remains buried in West Lake? Later generations hated this shameless traitor—Qin Hui—, and made his iron statue kneeling in front of Yue Fei's tomb, as a punishment for being a traitor.</p>
<p>This has not yet eliminated the hatred in our hearts, so some people use flour to make small strips to represent Qin Hui, put them in a pot and fry them, and then eat them in the belly. This is 汕炸烩 (烩 and 檜 are homophones).</p>
<p>Children, look at the ending of the traitor. It is like this.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River and the Yellow River</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiang</p>
<p>The Yangtze is long,</p>
<p>The Yellow River is yellow,</p>
<p>Coming from the Kunlun Mountains,</p>
<p>Flowing into the ocean.</p>
<p>One crosses the Wuxia Gorge's thousands of dangers,</p>
<p>One jumps over the Dragon Gate's hundred-foot waves.</p>
<p>One is the nation's wealth warehouse,</p>
<p>One is the home of ancient civilization.</p>
<p>The Yangtze is long,</p>
<p>The Yellow River is yellow,</p>
<p>Both symbolize the long history of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The Yangtze is long,</p>
<p>The Yellow River is yellow,</p>
<p>The Northeast is invaded,</p>
<p>The Northwest is too barren.</p>
<p>May my children,</p>
<p>From now on, be determined to wipe out national humiliation,</p>
<p>Inland rivers are not allowed to be navigated by foreign ships;</p>
<p>May my children,</p>
<p>From now on, work hard to learn science,</p>
<p>Quickly come and prevent floods.</p>
<p>The Yangtze is long,</p>
<p>The Yellow River is yellow,</p>
<p>Both symbolize the brilliant refining of the Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Animals' Methods of Conveying Messages</h3>
<p>— Chen Shicong</p>
<p>We humans have language, and we can use language to convey messages. But, what methods do small animals use to convey messages? Below I will introduce several different methods of conveying messages by animals to the children. I think the children will all be very welcome!</p>
<p>Children, when you lose a piece of candy or some biscuits on the ground, if an ant finds it, it will summon many of its kind to move it into the cave. Their tool for conveying messages is the pair of antennae on their heads. Children, haven't you ever seen two ants touching each other with their antennae? At that time, they were conveying messages!</p>
<p>Rabbits can hardly make any sounds at all, because making a sound will attract the attention of the enemy. However, they can knock out various tones on the ground with their hind feet to convey messages to each other.</p>
<p>The method of conveying messages by American antelopes is very ingenious. When it encounters an enemy, the large patch of white hair on its buttocks will immediately stand up, shining in the sun like a mirror. This dazzling white color is telling its companions that an enemy is invading! Hurry up and escape. Other animals like elks also have this return light signal to spread their alarm signals.</p>
<h3>Nickel Coins Should Not Be Put in the Mouth to Bite</h3>
<p>— Yan Xinquan</p>
<p>Not long ago, — I saw a masterpiece by a famous "benevolent" gentleman in the Children's Special of this newspaper on April 19th, the title of which has been forgotten, but the general meaning I remember is like this: "Why can nickel coins be attracted by magnets?" The article involved the identification of the authenticity of nickel coins, probably saying: counterfeit nickel coins are dim in light and have tooth marks after biting hard; real nickel coins are bright in light and have no tooth marks after biting hard.</p>
<p>This method of distinguishing authenticity can indeed be said to be extremely simple! I know that the children who read this simple method must remember it in their hearts. If they encounter nickel coins, they must try biting them to see if they are accurate!</p>
<p>However, I think this method of trying to bite is very inappropriate! Because a nickel coin that has been in circulation for a long time will inevitably have a considerable number of germs attached to it. Now that we want to identify the authenticity of this nickel coin, to put it in our mouth to bite rashly, isn't that a very dangerous thing? Moreover, after biting hard, the teeth will also suffer considerable damage! Therefore, I hope that children in general do not use this method to test the authenticity of nickel coins, because it is very harmful to hygiene. But children should indeed pay attention, and adults must also abstain from it!</p>
<h3>Kaleidoscope of the World</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Estonia with Seas on Three Sides</p>
<p>Terrain National Flag Capital Streets Boys Girls</p>
<p>Neighbors with the Sea: Estonia, a small European country, seems to like to be neighbors with the sea, with seas on three sides. It borders the Gulf of Finland to the north, the Baltic Sea to the west, and the Gulf of Riga to the south. It is connected to the Soviet Union in the east and west. Therefore, the coastline is very long and very tortuous.</p>
<p>Emerging Small Country: Before the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, there was no country named Estonia in the world. Originally, it was a province of the Soviet Union. After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, it seceded from the Soviet Union and established its own country. Soon, all countries recognized it, and in 1920, the Soviet Union also recognized its independence.</p>
<p>Three-Colored National Flag: There are several countries in the world that use three colors to form a flag, such as France's blue, white, and red, Romania's blue, yellow, and red, and Peru's red, white, and red. All the colors are very beautiful. Among these, the colors of Estonia's national flag are the most dull. Originally, it was made of blue, black, and white.</p>
<p>No President: Although Estonia is a democratic republic, it does not have a president like other democratic countries. The power of the country is in the hands of the parliament. The State Minister manages the administration, and the people are all small and equal. There is no distinction of nobility or class.</p>
<p>Three Hundred-Year-Old University: Education in Estonia is very developed. There are more than one thousand three hundred primary schools, eighty middle schools, and one university in the country. This university is in Tart, with more than four thousand students. It has been established for more than three hundred years since it opened in 1632.</p>
<h3>Ten Minutes of Science Teaching and Doing</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The Magic of Light</p>
<p>Everyone knows that machines work according to certain rules; the stars that twinkle in the sky also operate according to certain rules. So, does something as mysterious as light also follow certain rules?</p>
<p>I can answer you immediately, it also follows certain rules. For example, those who have cameras all know to choose the light, aim the lens, and open the lens for an appropriate amount of time to let the light in. Then, with a "click," a photo is taken. How did this photo come about? The mysterious thing is in that lens.</p>
<p>The lens on the camera is made of a round piece of glass. We call this piece of glass a lens. What creates the image is this lens. Originally, when the light from an object enters the lens, it bends and gathers into an image on a photographic plate behind the lens. So the quality of a camera depends entirely on whether the lens is good or not?</p>
<p>Ordinary magnifying glasses can also be used to create images. If you hold such a magnifying glass in one hand and point it at the scenery outside the door, and hold a piece of white paper in the other hand and put it behind the lens, you can see a beautiful landscape painting on the white paper. Its principle is exactly the same as that of a camera.</p>
<p>With this magnifying glass, you can play many tricks. If you don't have one, you can combine two glass covers on a watch, fill them with water in the middle, and you will have a lens. You can use it to play many interesting tricks.</p>
<h3>First Picture</h3>
<p>Light a candle at night, and it may create a good inverted image like the one in the picture.</p>
<p>For example, take this lens to the sunlight and make the sunlight pass through the lens and gather into a very small white spot. If you put a piece of paper on this small white spot, it will burn. The (burning glass) that is usually used is this kind of lens.</p>
<p>Light bends after it goes from the air into the lens. It also bends after it goes from the air into the water. You must have seen it: if there is a stick, half of it is in the water and the other half is exposed to the air, the stick seems to bend on the water surface. You can fill half a cup of water and put a pen in it to try.</p>
<p>There is also a common trick, which is also done by applying the principle of light bending. Put a copper coin or a silver dime in a bowl, and keep backing away until you can't see the copper coin in the bowl. Then, ask another person to pour some water into the bowl, and you will see the copper coin immediately.</p>
<h3>(Second Illustration)</h3>
<p>By using two watch glasses, you can make a magnifying glass for fun.</p>
<p>The above tricks tell us that light refracts or bends when it travels from air into glass or water. Therefore, light also follows certain rules.</p>

<h3>Morning of a Day</h3>
<p>— Li Xiaocen</p>
<p>The red sunlight shines on the glass window, emitting a clear brilliance. Ah! It’s getting late, I hurriedly got out of bed and put on my clothes, then went outside. I only heard a melodious song in my ears. Looking up, oh! It turned out to be the little birds singing in the trees. At this time, the lovely sun was hanging high in the sky, and the gentle breeze was blowing on my face, arousing my interest in sightseeing. So I went out to play with my sisters. On the road, I only saw the tender green willows swaying in the wind, as if bowing to us. The bright red peach blossoms were in full bloom. The lush green grass, the crystal clear flowing water, and the lively little birds made my heart particularly happy. After a while, we arrived at a pond and sat down to talk for a while. Soon, we went forward again to a lonely and deserted place, without flowers, grass, or trees, it simply looked like a desolate world. We felt very bored, so we followed the original road home. At this time, the sun had already risen very high, and it was almost noon.</p>
<h3>Chemical Garden</h3>

<p>Gardens are places we like to go, but it is a pity that they are outdoors, and we cannot move them indoors. Don’t you children feel this is a drawback? But it doesn't matter, I now have a simple method that will allow your bedroom or study to grow a garden overnight. What kind of garden? A chemical garden.</p>
<p>Prepare a glass teacup, preferably white. Then go to the pharmacy to buy some water glass, and crystalline copper sulfate, nickel sulfate, zinc sulfate, and cobalt nitrate. These are the only things you need to make the garden.</p>
<p>First, dissolve the water glass in water, then crush the various crystals mentioned above into rice-grain-sized pieces, and throw them randomly into the cup. Don't put too much. In this way, the garden is successfully made. The next morning, when you get up, you will definitely see tall trees, lush green grass, red and yellow flowers, and rockeries covered with moss inside the cup... In short, it is a very exquisite garden.</p>
<p>If you don't shake the cup, this garden can be preserved for a very, very long time.</p>

<p>Nowadays, children's education in European and American countries is very well-organized. Their various extracurricular activities are worth learning from. For example, sunbathing has a great relationship with children's health. The picture below shows a kindergarten in Germany doing gymnastics outdoors, fully exposed to sunlight. The picture behind shows infants aged four or five in an infant school in England sleeping in the sun. Look how happy and interesting they are.</p>
<h3>Biography of a Righteous Dog (19)</h3>
<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>Little Nello put the drum-playing wooden puppet in her hand and said in a low voice, "Alo, this toy was found by me in the snow, please accept it. Dear, may God bless you." Before Little Alo could thank him, he had already slipped down from the shed roof and ran away like a fly in the dark.</p>
<p>That night, a fire suddenly broke out in the mill. Although the main building of the mill and the miller's residence were not burned down, the outer buildings and many straws were burned down. People in the whole village ran out in shock to watch. The fire truck drove desperately from Anfaner. The miller, Coggans, was originally insured and did not suffer any losses, but he was extremely angry. He said that this fire was not accidental, and someone must be making trouble there.</p>
<p>Little Nello woke up from his dream and rushed to fight the fire with the others, but Coggans angrily threw him aside and shouted loudly, "You were sneaking around here at dusk, you should understand what happened this time."</p>
<p>Little Nello listened silently, simply stunned. He imagined that such words would not be easily said unless it was a joke, but how could he joke at such a time?</p>
<p>The next day, the miller, Coggans, still said the same to his neighbors. Although he did not say that Little Nello set the fire, he had hinted to people that the child had been wandering near the mill at dusk, wondering what he was doing there, and he was greatly dissatisfied with Coggans for not being able to see Little Alo. As a result, everyone in the village echoed Coggans' words, because he was the richest landlord in the village, and everyone with a son wanted to marry Little Alo as their daughter-in-law, so they were suspicious of Little Nello and often looked at him with cold eyes and sarcastic remarks.</p>
<p>Everyone did not say anything explicit in front of Little Nello, but completely believed Coggans' hints. From then on, when Little Nello and Patrasche delivered milk to their house every morning, they no longer greeted them with smiles or comforting words as usual. Only because they were all poor and ignorant people, seeing that the only rich man in the village was opposing the child, they also followed suit. Poor Little Nello was in an isolated position and no longer had the ability to resist the hostility of most people.</p>
<p>Mrs. Coggans cried and said to her husband, "You are too cruel to that child. He is certainly an honest and innocent child. Even if he is dissatisfied with you in his heart, he will never do such an evil thing." But that Coggans was a very stubborn person. Once he said something, he insisted on not changing it, and he did not necessarily know in his heart that he had wronged others.</p>
<p>Little Nello dealt with this unfair treatment with pride and patience, and never said a word of defense, but when he and Patrasche were together and there were no outsiders around, he could not help but feel angry. He was still secretly thinking in his heart, "As long as I win the championship, then they may praise me too much."</p>
<p>But Little Nello was still a child under sixteen, who had always lived in this small world, and had been treated and praised by others since childhood. Now, he saw that everyone in this small world was opposing him for no reason, which was indeed a very embarrassing thing. Especially in this snowy and freezing winter, the only light and warmth he could get was by the stove in the village people's houses, listening to the neighbors' words of comfort. During this cold winter, everyone seemed to be closer and more affectionate, but they became more and more estranged and indifferent to Little Nello and Patrasche. Poor them can only stay with their old grandfather, who is sick in bed in that hut. There is usually no fire in their fireplace, and there is usually no bread in their cupboard. Because another person delivered milk from Anfaner without distributing it to the people in the village, only three or four families accepted the half-milk delivered by Little Nello. Therefore, the weight of Little Nello's green cart has been reduced a lot, and the money bag beside him has also been reduced accordingly.</p>

<h3>Planar, Three-Dimensional, and Contour of the Fish Market</h3>
<p>— Xiaosheng</p>
<p>On the 11th of this month, the Shanghai Fish Market officially opened, with a total of more than 500 people attending. The venue was arranged in the grand auction hall. A temporary platform was built in front of the office entrance, and many commemorative gifts such as silver cups and shields presented by various sectors were placed on it. In addition to the national flags, red and green fish lanterns made of gauze were hung high in the venue. The style was exquisite and unique, and quite beautiful. After performing the ceremony as usual at about 10 o'clock, the chairman first reported the creation process, followed by speeches by various representatives, and finally a reply by the general manager. The ceremony was completed in the wind and rain. After photography and refreshments, the reception staff led the participants to visit various parts of the market.</p>
<p>The lower-level auction hall is a small vegetable market-style location built of concrete, like the ones in Shanghai, covering an area of 211.7 feet long from north to south and 71.2 feet long from east to west. The fishing boat wharf is to the east, and the market office is connected to the north. Countless small iron rails are embedded in the concrete floor, and 40 small iron wheelbarrow cars are placed on them for transporting fish away from the wharf. The rails go straight to the wharf, and the small cars are also towed by electric motors. There are three wharfs, with a total length of 600 feet and a width of 25 feet. The construction is extremely solid, with iron frames and concrete covered with iron sheets. The wharfs are equipped with a number of freshwater taps for fishing boats to use free of charge. Standing on the wharf and looking east, the smoke and waves are vast, and the sails are fluttering. The Koujiang Wharf is visible to the northeast, only six miles away. Along the west side of the wharf, there are four temporary warehouses, 42 feet long, 14 feet high, and 25 feet wide, for temporarily placing fish to protect them from wind and rain.</p>
<p>The brokers' offices are located west of the auction hall, with a total of two floors. The ground floor has 27 offices, each 40 feet long and 14 and a half feet wide. The second floor is separately designated as business offices for various fishing vessel companies, with a total of 25 offices, complete with sanitary toilet facilities, and one storage room. The auction information is also posted in the market, just like a regular stock exchange.</p>
<p>On the lower floor of the office building, there is a small-scale bank, which provides loans to fishermen, called the Fisheries Trust Cooperative Business Office. There are also one office for employees, a hall, and a reception room. There are five fish market offices, one storage room and one for workers, a telephone room, and a toilet. Dining rooms and reception rooms are also available. The second floor has one general office, two director's offices, two meeting rooms, one archive room, a small office, a supervisor's office, a research room, a library, a technical room, a reception room, a display room, a dining room, a kitchen, and a toilet. The third floor is the staff dormitory, with six bedrooms, one worker's room, one bathroom, and one toilet. The fourth floor has a large platform and one wireless radio room, with a very clear view of the wharf. The fifth floor has a small area, only 25 feet square, and is the bedroom for the wireless radio operator and the weather reporter. The sixth and seventh floors are the same size as the fifth floor and are used as a weather signal station, also known as a watchtower. High-intensity lights are installed at night for use as a lighthouse and can also send signals to warn fishing boats. The watchtower is 78 feet high. Climbing to the highest point and looking around, the city center area and the Shanghai Special Zone, as well as the Songjiang and Huangpu Rivers, are scattered like stars and winding in front of you.</p>
<p>Entering the cold storage from the main entrance, there is a very long dark and deep passage. There are five large cold storage rooms, two manager's rooms, one ice-making room, two freezing rooms, two machine rooms, and several processing rooms, which can store a total of 1,500 tons of fish. The northernmost end is the ice-making area. Steel frames are used to divide the bottom layer into water ditches, which are covered with thick wooden boards several inches thick, divided into hundreds of small pieces, each four feet square. When making ice, salt essence is poured in, and after cold air is passed in, ice blocks are formed soon. Then, a hand-operated machine is used to pull out the ice blocks and transport them out, with a daily output of 50 tons of ice. The refrigeration machine room is located next door and has a 500-horsepower engine. Also, because a large amount of purified water is needed every day, a large artesian well is set up, 1,200 feet deep. The water tower is located outside the cold storage and is extremely magnificent and beautiful. The entire venue covers an area of 47 mu, and the construction cost 400,000 yuan. The preparatory construction period lasted for two years before it was completed. The land rights belong to the Shanghai Dredging Bureau, and an annual rent of more than 30,000 yuan must be paid. The land was formed by the bureau's newly filled Jiangxinsha, formerly known as Zhoujiazui Sand, now known as Dinghai Island. A large bridge named Dinghai Bridge has been built to connect to Yangshupu and other places on the mainland. The public bus route No. 9 of the Special Zone can directly reach the orange bank.</p>
<p>Some of the exhibits on the auction site that day deserve special attention. The first is the models of old and new fishing boats and fishing vessels. The second is some fish specimen models. Some were dried and preserved on wooden frames, looking lifelike; some were soaked in alcohol in glass bottles, as if they were about to jump out. There were more than 100 specimen bottles in total. The third is some half-dead fish, shrimp, clams, and shellfish in large earthenware pots, with strange shapes and various colors, which were very beautiful.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Sheng, a staff member of the market, all kinds of fish produced along the coast and in lakes and ponds in our country are mostly gathered here because of the convenient transportation in Shanghai. The fish consumption in the past three years: In terms of quantity, 1.4 million dan in 1934 was the largest, followed by 1935 and 1933. In terms of value, due to the relationship between supply and demand, the prices fluctuated, but 16,861,196.24 yuan in 1933 ranked first. In the past three years, Shanghai people's fish consumption totaled 3,636,422 dan and 62 jin. The average annual consumption is more than 1,212,140 dan. The total value is 40,062,7941.15 yuan, with an average annual value of more than 13,354,2647 yuan. According to the latest survey by the Public Security Bureau, the city's population is 3.67 million people. Assuming that all the fish consumed are sold in the city, the average per capita annual consumption of fish is 36 and a half jin, worth more than 3.9 yuan. However, it is very difficult to accurately investigate this figure.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned huge amount of products can be roughly divided into four categories: seafood, freshwater fish, salted fish, and seafood delicacies. Seafood comes first, followed by salted fish, then freshwater fish, and seafood delicacies are the least. Seafood delicacies are expensive and not a necessity for ordinary people.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, so we can skip discussing them briefly. Speaking of seafood: it can be divided into fishing vessel catches, ice-fresh fishing boats, and ice-fresh bucket heads. Among them, the most is transported by ice-fresh fishing boats. The source is the Shengsi Islands and Changtu and other places off the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The varieties are large yellow croaker, small yellow croaker, ribbonfish, cuttlefish, pomfret, hairtail, flounder, shark, eel, sole, snakehead, horse mackerel, spotted grouper, copper pot, white fruit, golden threadfin bream, hairtail, hairy comb, white page, red fish, red lady, horse mackerel, threespot wrasse, silk snapper, oxtail, pufferfish, roundhead, blue streak cleaner wrasse, squid, red snapper, octopus, catfish, sturgeon, smelt, big tube, prawn, swimming crab, razor clam, cockle, etc., totaling fifty or sixty varieties. The sales of large and small yellow croaker, ribbonfish, and cuttlefish are the largest.</p>
<p>Fish is the main food for ordinary people: those imported into Shanghai come from Weihaiwei, Yantai, Shengshan Sijiao, Daishan, and Japan, Russia, Canada, etc., and most of them are landed in Wusong Town. There are fewer sales in this city, and more are transshipped to nearby areas. The varieties are salmon, bluefin tuna, dried squid, dried mackerel, ribbonfish, dried cod, horse mackerel, dried smelt, dried shrimp, dried yellow croaker, dried shrimp skin, dried silver carp, white fruit, dried pufferfish, large dried shark, eel, broadmouth, etc., dozens of varieties. Salmon, bluefin tuna, dried squid, and white fruit are the most popular.</p>
<p>Freshwater fish comes from Huzhou, Jiaxing, Linghu in Zhejiang, and Changshu, Kunshan, and Dongting in Jiangsu. Fishmongers are very welcome to transport and sell them. The varieties are black carp, grass carp, silver carp, crucian carp, small fish, bream, mud carp, common carp, mandarin fish, paradise fish, eel, softshell turtle, silverfish, cuttlefish, Chinese herring, eel, mullet, chub, shrimp, crab, etc. Black carp, grass carp, silver carp, and crucian carp are the most popular, and mandarin fish are the most expensive.</p>
<p>After the tour, everyone took the new boat of the city ferry and returned leisurely in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Opinion</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Has Not Failed</h3>
<p>— Wang Weiping</p>
<p>Since the Abyssinian emperor fled and the capital was captured, and Italy announced the annexation of Abyssinia, some servile people said so, and some simple-minded people thought so: the weak cannot resist the strong, and backward and small nations will only destroy themselves by resisting advanced imperialism; if you don't believe it, look at the result of Abyssinia's resistance! In this way, weak and small nations can only docilely accept all the attacks and oppressions of imperialists, and the so-called national independence and national liberation will become empty talk. - This is really a confused and extremely dangerous view!</p>
<p>We say: yes, judging from the current situation, Abyssinia has been defeated by the Black Shirt Prime Minister's poison gas. But this defeat is glorious and worthy of pride for the Abyssinian people and the weak nations of the world. Abyssinia has no airplanes, no tanks, no poison gas, and no latest killing weapons. It is very backward in all aspects, but such a backward and small country does not succumb to Italian imperialism. It resisted the aggressors for half a year, and won many glorious victories in the resistance, breaking Mussolini's dream of sweeping through Abyssinia and frightening all the imperialists who oppressed weak nations. In this way, although Abyssinia was defeated for a time, it won a breath of fresh air for the weak nations of the world.</p>
<p>Italy has long had the intention of annexing Abyssinia, and its military deployment in East Africa has long been very thorough. Even if Abyssinia did not resist, Mussolini would never give up or postpone the plan to destroy Abyssinia. In this way, if Abyssinia did not resist and welcomed the Italian army to the Abyssinian capital very docilely, respectfully presented the map of Abyssinia to Mussolini, and docilely became a slave to Italian imperialism, it would be a disgrace to the Abyssinian people and a shame to the weak nations of the world!</p>
<p>Because of Abyssinia's heroic resistance, Mussolini's war expenses for conquering Abyssinia have cost seven or eight hundred million lire, and Italy's economy has shown a great crisis under the sanctions of the League of Nations. This is a major trauma suffered by Italian imperialism in its invasion of Abyssinia. Under this trauma, Rome's prestige will be greatly reduced, and Mussolini's rule will also face difficulties in maintaining it. But if Abyssinia had surrendered to Mussolini without resistance, Italy's aggression would have increased even more, and Abyssinia, which was subservient to it, would have been even more difficult to liberate. This is objectively equivalent to Abyssinia's suicide!</p>
<p>Furthermore, Abyssinia's resistance has won the sympathy of weak nations and people of justice all over the world, and has increased the anti-imperialist sentiment of weak nations all over the world. In fact, since Abyssinia began its resistance, which public opinion in the world, except for Italy, has not expressed sympathy for it? Which weak nation is not fervently hoping for its victory? In Africa, Europe, and America, the struggles between blacks and Italians and the general people's hatred of various expressions of Italy are not directly led by Abyssinia's resistance? Based on these, we can say that although Abyssinia has been defeated temporarily, its spirit of resistance is still growing among the Abyssinian people and the weak nations of the world. This spirit may be expressed in a greater and more opportunistic way at any time, breaking through the oppression of Italy and all imperialism and creating a free and bright world. The current world situation tells us that very events are likely to occur in the world at any time. When a very event comes, the Abyssinian people and the weak nations of the world will be easier to win their independence and freedom: this is the self-confidence I should have.</p>
<p>Now, although Italy has announced the annexation of Abyssinia, due to the increasingly acute conflicts among imperialists, the League of Nations has not abandoned sanctions, and countries such as Britain and France have expressed their attitude of not recognizing the destruction of Abyssinia. The ministers of various countries stationed in the Abyssinian capital are still struggling to continue, and most of Abyssinia's territory has not been taken away. Even the Abyssinian capital and other places are still in turmoil, and the Abyssinians in the conquered areas are still constantly resisting. If Abyssinia can use international contradictions and continue to resist to the end, it is very likely to achieve final victory.</p>
<p>International Intelligence</p>
<h3>A Country of Poor Farmers</h3>
<p>— Bian Da</p>
<p>Romania is not only an agricultural country, but a poor and backward agricultural country. The Romanian bourgeoisie will exhaust all methods to develop industry, but its fate remains in this state of stagnation.</p>
<p>Romania has only two cities with a population of around ten thousand – Bucharest and Kishinev – and the total number of industrial workers in the country is only two hundred thousand. From this, it is sufficient to prove what kind of country Romania is.</p>
<p>Before the war, Romania was one of the main wheat exporting countries. Its large-scale wheat exports stemmed from the poverty of the farmers. The Romanian nobles absorbed their blood and sweat, and the large quantities of wheat were exported abroad. What about the farmers themselves? They lived by eating corn. This situation has always been, and still is, the same.</p>
<p>Sixty percent of the farmers are illiterate, which also determines the backwardness of Romania's production technology. Although they have vast natural plains, the harvest area is still the smallest in Europe.</p>
<p>Romania's basic heavy industry is also very lacking in raw materials. Iron smelting only exists in the Transylvania region, which was merged after the war, but it is also very limited. The utilization of water power is also hindered by the lack of sauce [likely a typo for resources/infrastructure]. The development of ordinary commodity industry, which can encourage domestic market purchasing power, is also pitifully small, naturally mainly due to the excessive division of the general farming masses.</p>
<p>The stagnation of Romania's economic development is due to various other reasons. The losses during the war were also one of the fatal reasons. All oil pools were systematically destroyed by Britain during the war – because Britain feared that the German army would occupy Romania and use this economic boost to prolong the war.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is no convenient transportation line connecting the entire territory of Romania. The railways in the newly merged areas, such as the railways in Transylvania, are concentrated in Budapest. The railways in Bukovina pass through Poland far from Vienna. The railways in Bessarabia lead directly to Odessa and Moscow, while it is difficult for the western new districts to establish contact with Romania's Black Sea port. Moreover, the railway administration in all places is very poorly managed, and the condition of the railways and carriages is not good. Without new investment of millions of Lei, it is impossible for the road administration to be successful. But does Romania have this national strength recently?</p>
<p>Romania's lack of capital is also an undeniable fact. The interest rate for long-term loans often reaches 30 to 40 percent, except for bank loans with political activity.</p>
<p>Now they are making their best efforts to strictly prohibit the export of cash, and the trend of financial decline has only slightly stabilized. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>The value of Lei fell to one-fortieth of its full value. And this decline did not occur during the war, but after the war, and only slightly increased from 1927 to 1928.</p>
<p>The amount of domestic banknotes issued cannot be increased either, because of the lack of production capital. Because of this, the productive forces that Romania could develop have become impossible. The value of 21 billion Lei is only 30 million pounds, which is actually not too much in a country with 18 million people.</p>
<p>After the war, Romania's population doubled, but the circulation of its capital was less than that of the old Romania before the war.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1928, the National Peasant Party took power. From then on, the policy of the Romanian capitalists, who wanted to independently plunder the laboring masses without the help of foreign capital, failed. They could not stabilize finance, develop productivity, or reorganize the scattered transportation system on their own. They had to surrender to the awakening of the American dream.</p>
<p>To understand this, we must recall the pre-war era. In the agricultural old Romania, the rulers were landlords, and there was no industrial capitalist class. At that time, the only important industry in the country was oil extraction, which was owned by foreign capitalists. The Romanian bourgeoisie was merely primitive usurers. On the one hand, they plundered the confused nobles, and on the other hand, they exploited the poor farmers. At the same time, they jointly ruled the country with the big landlords.</p>
<p>Many major changes have taken place in Romania before and after the war, the most important of which are:</p>
<p>First, after the land reform, the economic advantage of the big landlord class was lost, but at the same time, it also considerably developed the rise of the bourgeoisie in another aspect.</p>
<p>Second, since the annexation of the land of former Hungary, the Romanian bourgeoisie, due to national differences, could not completely apply the agricultural conditions of the old Romania. The Magyar bourgeoisie in Transylvania is very industrialized, can represent the power of industrial capital, and has considerable connections with Budpest and the older Vienna banks, so it can better represent the power of higher commercial capital.</p>
<p>Third, because the bourgeoisie of the old Romania attempted to control the bourgeoisie of the newly merged areas, and strived to rely on its own strength to embark on the road of industrial capitalism.</p>
<p>But how exactly did Romania exclude external forces and embark on the road of industrial capital on its own? The main thing is naturally to build new enterprises. The remarkable progress is as follows:</p>
<p>Newly established enterprises can lease factory sites. Their machinery imports are exempt from tariffs. In the first ten years of operation, their surplus production tax is less than 3 percent, and in the next ten years it is only 4 percent. The main ones, such as mills and sugar industry, have made considerable progress.</p>
<p>All raw products allow family industries to have priority, as long as their prices are cheaper than foreign goods.</p>
<p>Heavy taxes are levied on the export of food and raw materials. This not only has many benefits for fiscal revenue, but also protects Romania's cheap raw materials and cheap labor. Moreover, the price of food can be maintained at its low value by relying on the heavy export tax, which can also head towards the value of labor.</p>
<p>Increase the tax rate on the import of gold-made industrial products.</p>
<p>Make every effort to hinder the labor movement in order to benefit the generous profits of industrial capitalists.</p>
<p>However, how much effect has this many efforts achieved? This is a big question for us. Their industry has indeed developed considerably, but it has not fundamentally transformed its agricultural country characteristics.</p>
<p>Romania once made improvements to the land problem. However, because this policy was not implemented resolutely, only a portion of the people were allocated land. According to the land reform rate, 2,915,000 people were registered to receive land, but in fact only 1,150,000 people were allocated land. From this, it can be seen that only 30 percent of the registered people actually received land, and when allocating land, priests, teachers, and soldiers often received priority over farmers. Moreover, even if the government did allocate land to farmers in accordance with the land reform law, the area would still be too small, and what was allocated would really not be enough to maintain a living. Three million people own land, but each person owns less than five acres, and the average income is only 1.4 acres. No matter what, the harvest of five acres of land is not enough to maintain the life of a farming family.</p>
<p>The large estate system has not been reduced. More than 20 percent of the land is still under the large estate system of a small number of large landlords and agricultural entrepreneurs, and at the same time, a large number of agricultural workers are still parasitic under the pressure of the large landlords.</p>
<p>Humorous Sketch</p>
<h3>A Man and a Mosquito</h3>
<p>— Translated by Si Fan</p>
<p>I don't know who boarded the car first, really, for a long time I didn't even know he was in the carriage. This passenger car is the last bus from London to a small inland city – it's a slow bus that stops at every stop, so slow that you understand what is called "forever." When it first started, it was quite full of people, but when it reached a station near the suburbs, many passengers got off one by one. When we left the last circle of places belonging to London, only I was left – or, I only knew that it was me.</p>
<p>Sitting in a noisy night train, if you are alone, you will have a free aesthetic feeling. This is a very pleasant freedom. You can do whatever you want. You can talk to yourself, as loudly as you want, no one can hear you. You can argue with Zhang San and Li Si, and make them roll in the mud, anyway, you don't have to be afraid of any rebuttal. You can play upside down, and no one will laugh at you. You can sing, or dance the foxtrot, or practice a golf posture. You can open or close the windows at will, and it won't cause anyone to object. You can open or close both windows. In fact, you can open and close them in a waltz-like freedom. You can sit in any corner you want, or you can sit in them all in turn. You can lie comfortably on the cushions and enjoy that kind of unreserved happiness.</p>
<p>I didn't do these things that night. I just happened not to think of them. What I did was much more ordinary. After the last passenger left, I put down my weekly magazine, stretched my arms and legs, stood up and looked out the window at the quiet summer night that I was passing through, and noticed that the afterglow of the day was still faintly shining in the northern sky; walked from this side of the car to the other side, leaned on that window and looked again; lit a cigarette, sat down, and read the weekly magazine again. At this time, I discovered my fellow traveler, he came and stood on my sign. It turned out that he was a winged, boastful, and daring little bug, which we usually call a mosquito. I drove him away from my sign. He spun around the carriage, measured its length, width, and height, flew to every window, circled around the light, and decided that in this room, the big animal in that corner was more interesting than anything else, and came to peep at my neck.</p>
<p>I waved my hand again. He avoided my hand, wandered around the carriage again, came back, and sat on the back of my hand without ceremony. That's enough, I said: Generosity and tolerance have limits. I have warned you twice that I am a special thing. We hate those who stab us for no reason and make people feel itchy. I seem to be wearing a black gauze hat. I sentence you to death. Justice requires this, and the court allows this. You have many crimes. You are a rogue; you are disturbing public safety; you are riding the bus without a ticket; you are eating meat without food stamps. For these and many other crimes, you must die. I raised my right hand and slapped it quickly and heavily. He just happened to want to embarrass me, and dodged it lightly and playfully. This made me angry. I used my hands, my weekly magazine, to chase him everywhere; I jumped on the seat and chased him around the lamp; I adopted cat-like tactics, quietly waiting for him to come down, approaching him stealthily, and attacking him with lightning speed.</p>
<p>But none of these methods worked. He flaunted and openly joked with me, just like a skillful bullfighter teasing an enraged bull with his tricks. Obviously, he was entertaining himself by this, and he was disturbing my peace entirely for his own entertainment. He wanted to play a trick, and what trick could be better than letting this big, clumsy, tasty, incompetent, and unimaginable animal chase him around? From this, I gradually thought about his spirit, and no longer regarded him as a small bug. He gradually developed a personality, and he had the same wisdom as me. He wanted to compete with me in this carriage. I felt that my heart gradually became fond of him, and at the same time, my arrogant heart was suppressed. Clearly, he had won the competition just now. How could I be proud of being superior to him? Why not be more generous and tolerant? Generosity and compassion are the noblest qualities of mankind. Only by applying these two virtues can I restore my prestige. At the moment, I am a ridiculous figure, a source of amusement, a laughing stock. Only by explaining my compassion can I reorganize my moral dignity and return to my corner with glory. I revoke the death sentence, I said, returning to sit down. I can't kill you, but I can pardon you. I pardon you.</p>
<p>I picked up the weekly magazine, and he flew and stood on it. Silly Mr., I said, you have put your own little life into my hands. As long as I close this respectable weekly magazine from both sides, you will immediately be a corpse, turning into a meat sandwich in the articles "Peace Trap" and "Mr. Fat Man's Humility." But, I won't do that. I have pardoned you, and I want you to be convinced that a word spoken by this big animal counts as a word. Besides, I don't want to kill you anymore. Because I understand you more, I don't feel that I have a feeling for you. I think that Francis the dog trainer once called you "little brother." I certainly can't achieve the kind of universal love and politeness in Christianity, but I recognize a</p>

Because we are both mortal beings, we have formed this mutually beneficial relationship. The mystery of life and its mystery are common to us. I guess you don't know what your journey is like, and I don't dare to be confident that I understand it much more. We are really a floating illusion, sometimes bright and sometimes dark, coming out of that dark night and entering the bright carriage, circling around the light for a while, and then leaving the car and throwing ourselves into the dark night, or...</p>
<p>"Do you need to go to the front tonight, sir?" A voice asked from outside the window. It was a friendly porter hinting that my destination had arrived. I thanked him and said that I must have fallen asleep. Grabbing my hat and cane, I got out of the car and threw myself into the cool summer night. As I turned to close the carriage door, I still saw my companion flying around the light...</p>

<h3>The Heart of Reputation</h3>
<p>— Xu Wo</p>
<p>Since I was a child, I have heard our teachers say that Westerners regard reputation as their second life. This seems to say that Europeans and Americans pay special attention to personal reputation. In fact, paying attention to reputation is not just Europeans and Americans. We Chinese also attach great importance to our own reputation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the so-called importance of reputation is not unrelated to personal interests. Whether objectively or in the popular understanding, we cannot separate the heart of reputation from personal egoism. Paying attention to reputation is not considered to be dominated by purely moral views, but is often dominated by utilitarian ideas. Therefore, taking care of reputation cannot be said to be purely moral behavior. Because if everyone is worried about damaging their reputation, and if they are trying to gain a good reputation, then they will often associate themselves with being worshiped, praised, respected, etc. This means that they are starting from their own interests. Seeking fame is enough to raise their social status, and is enough to make themselves stand above the crowd and be surrounded by others, which is beneficial to them. Not only that, we Chinese have such a saying, called "both fame and wealth." This sentence clearly tells us that fame cannot be separated from wealth. People with fame can gain wealth, and people with wealth can often gain fame. If we compare these words with the real phenomena of society, it is indeed the case objectively. Just as Su Qin's sister-in-law said, "The younger brother has a high position and a lot of money." This logical formula is very clear. Having fame means having position, and having a high position means having a lot of wealth, so fame contains wealth, and fame leads to wealth. The only method and path for seeking fame in old China was studying, so the purpose of scholars was to seek fame and fortune. The so-called "ten years of hard study, no one asks, once you become famous, the world knows," is also explaining the process of studying for fame. As for the words "there are golden houses in books" and "there are beautiful women in books," it is even more explaining that studying can lead to fame, and fame can lead to wealth and even beautiful wives and concubines. So saying that seeking fame is seeking wealth is not unscientific. On the contrary, most people with wealth can also have fame. In rural areas, wealthy people are often the most famous people in that place. The officials who take office and the students who pass by have to visit him. It is said that this is going to admire his reputation. In the city, anyone with millions of family wealth is bound to be the most famous celebrity in that city. Because he has wealth and fame, all political and social facilities have to consult with him. Especially the modern election system is even more obvious. The elected person should have been a person with a good reputation and high prestige in the local area, but the modern election law stipulates property restrictions. This seems to say that wealthy people are people with a good reputation and high prestige. As for the result of the election, most of the wealthy and powerful people are elected. This also tells us that the famous people in those electoral districts and the people admired and praised by the general voters are precisely those people with property. From this, it can be known that fame and wealth are often united, and paying attention to reputation does not come from a purely moral concept, but has more or less personal utilitarianism contained in it.</p>
<p>Going a step further, the so-called fame and dishonor, like the concepts of good and evil, do not have absolute and unchanging standards. Many things that are honorable in the eyes of people in one social group are dishonorable if you change to a social point of view. For example, during the First World War in Europe, many famous generals of the participating countries, in the eyes of people in the upper class and patriots of those countries, had supreme honor, but in the eyes of people in the lower class, they were just fighting for imperialist aggression and plunder, and it was not an honorable thing. The millions of soldiers who died in the European War were seen by the imperialists as sacrificing their lives for the country, which was so glorious, but in the eyes of those dead people themselves, they were just being used as sacrifices by others, and they simply died very unworthy and shameful. Another example is Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia. In his eyes and in the eyes of the imperialists, it was very honorable, but in the eyes of all small and weak nations and the lower class, it was a shameful war and behavior of aggression, barbarism, and cruelty.</p>
<p>In this way, the so-called honor and dishonor themselves do not have a permanent and unchanging moral standard. Therefore, it is not necessarily that wanting honor is a very good and moral behavior, and not wanting honor is completely bad. Saying that we don't want honor [small paragraph unclear, seems to be correcting an earlier point about framing the question] The correct way to ask a question is not to say that we don't want honor; it should be said what kind of honor we want; it should be specifically said in what position and within what limits to pay attention to honor. The heart of reputation is good under certain conditions, and it cannot be dispensed with, but outside a certain position and a certain "limit," it is bad and should not be wanted. If you absolutely say that you don't care about reputation, then everything that harms others and benefits yourself can be done. "Let others laugh and scold, I will be a good official," if there is only chaos in society, and humans are only cruel and barbaric, killing each other, what kind of world would this be? If you absolutely say that a person only needs to pay attention to their own reputation, then any vanity and desire for fame can be done, and anything that can make oneself stand out can be done, then the result will also be dirty and unscrupulous. In today's society, there are many people who completely disregard reputation and social disapproval. They only stand on the basis of personal interests. As long as it is beneficial to themselves, no matter how much the majority of people are harmed and suffer because of me, and no matter how others oppose me, I will act as I please and go my own way, embracing the treacherous mentality of "I would rather betray the people of the world than let the people of the world betray me," and use society and others as sacrifices for their own interests. This is a very common phenomenon. There is another group of people whose individualistic vanity is very heavy. The ultimate goal of all activities is just to build on the point of how to make themselves stand out, make themselves famous all over the world, and be prominent. So on the one hand, they are jealous of others, fearing that others are higher than themselves. On the other hand, they never accept others' legitimate criticisms and never admit their slightest mistakes, thinking that this is detrimental to their own ability and reputation. Even when they cannot stand out through legitimate channels, they do not hesitate to take all shameful paths to seek rapid advancement, so that society knows that they exist and that they are extraordinary people. Like such people who love fame, not only are they also individualistic vanities whose premise is personal interests, but they will only end up in disgrace. As Huan Wen said, "If you can't leave a good name for a hundred generations, you should leave a bad name for ten thousand years," which is the most representative figure of this kind of individualistic heroic thought of the heart of reputation.</p>
<p>I think a person should also want reputation, but not with the premise of their own personal interests to hunt for fame and stand out. Because the heart of reputation is also a kind of upward vitality of our lives. If a person has no such requirement at all, then they will be disheartened and live and die like dead wood. Such people in society are nothing more than tumors. The heart of reputation can make people have creativity and promote people to work hard and move forward, but we must use the public and social welfare as the standard for determining our behavior. If my behavior is detrimental to society and the public, then even if it can make me famous and known to the world, I should not hunt for such reputation. If my behavior is to be done in accordance with the requirements of the interests of society and the public, and at the same time it can make me famous, then we do not need to deliberately avoid the name of being fond of fame and not actively do it. We do not refuse the name that should be obtained, and we do not seek the name that should not be obtained, even if it can be obtained immediately. So we also have to be encouraged by the heart of reputation, and also have to restrain our excessive desire for fame. This is the right way to seek fame and obtain fame.</p>
<p>Scientific Talks</p>
<h3>On Human Lifespan</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Biologists have researched the causes of aging and death in animals, leading to numerous theories. Some attribute it to blood degeneration, others to the deterioration of endocrine glands, and still others to poisoning by excretory products. Metchnikoff proposed that bacteria in the large intestine produce toxins that enter the bloodstream, poisoning body cells and causing them to age. Aged body cells are then consumed by white blood cells, gradually reducing the number of useful cells, leading to the gradual aging and death of the entire body. Some also argue that cell specialization is the cause of aging, as the human body is formed from a fertilized egg that specializes into tissues, organs, systems, and other complex individual parts. Normally, all cells divide labor and cooperate, which is conducive to survival. However, when some cells are damaged, the entire body suffers. In severe cases, even slight damage to the lungs, heart, or brain can lead to immediate death.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, the average lifespan of people today tends to be shorter than in the past. According to long-term research by many famous scientists, besides the significant impact of heredity, the influence of lifestyle should not be underestimated. People with long lifespans in previous generations often have long-lived descendants, while those with short lifespans often have descendants who die young. This has become a confirmed theory and needs no further discussion. Regarding the relationship between lifespan and lifestyle, scientists have also conducted long-term experiments with animals. Two white mice were used, one made to work pumping water and turning a wheel, while the other did not do this work. One was active, the other still. The still mouse lived twice as long as the active one. The difference in lifespan between the two was so great. Today, people have many opportunities for mental and physical labor, like the white mouse turning the water wheel. Compared to our ancestors who lived simple, quiet lives, the difference is significant. Therefore, the length of life can be predicted without divination.</p>
<p>Before the power of modern science can fully guarantee that the human body will never decline, and because the rate at which the "ability" within the human body disappears is accelerating, we seem to be in a very pessimistic situation regarding our lives. However, no! Although absolute immortality has not been slightly grasped with the power of science today, the progress of medical skills and attention to hygiene methods can passively prevent life from shortening its age, and actively extend life in the slightest!</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Roads</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Recently, the southern United States has been implementing the use of cotton cloth to build roads, which is certainly a novel piece of news. But first, we should understand that the cotton cloth mentioned here is certainly not the cotton cloth we wear, but a type of material made from cotton through a special manufacturing process that can be used to build roads. It is said that this type of road made from cotton cloth has a very strong resistance to moisture. At the same time, cars drive particularly smoothly on this road, reducing vibration by about half compared to before. However, because cotton cloth is very thin, the road is easily damaged by gravel, etc., and the cost of repairing roads with cotton cloth is also higher, making it not very economical.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to use cotton cloth to build roads can also be said to be a kind of scientific progress. However, this method in the United States is not due to scientific progress, but the result of an economic panic. More specifically, it is because of the recent overproduction of cotton in the United States and the continued seriousness of the unemployment problem, that they are trying to use cotton cloth to build roads, in order to consume the surplus cotton and provide employment for unemployed workers. In fact, cotton cloth factories for road use are being set up everywhere in the United States to showcase their "economic prosperity."</p>
