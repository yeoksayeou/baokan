<p>復决英國苟欲制意至少須得法國之合作欲得法國之合作又非接受法國對德之觀點不可但如此勢將促成德意之聯合而使制意工作愈臻困難英國此種顧慮殆至最近德國進兵萊茵而益顯法國窺見英國對德態度之模稜亦遂萌其故態示好於意而使甫見端倪之英法合作重生波折故苟非對德問題英法能及早妥恊則墨索里尼之征阿軍事自能放手做去直至阿國完全屈服而止反之假令英法二國今日卽能對於各種問題切實合作然其能吾使意就範亦爲疑問蓋英法合作之後其須應付者不僅爲一意國更有一德國也設德國而亦效意所爲則世界大戰卽可爆發此允爲英國所深慮故英法卽能完全合作對意亦不敢十分强硬此又可推論而得者也</p>
<p>今阿國抗禦强敵已至筋敝力盡之階段乃國際之援助愈呈渺茫之象於此而欲求國聯機構之不破壞侵略國家氣燄之不高張又安可得哉</p>

<p>長江一路、爲中國土產出品之最富地帶、允爲雜糧產生之中心區域、自上海至漢口一綫、蘇皖贛鄂四省購買力最强尤以舶來品居最多數、食物以鹽糖爲主、故外輪之航運此路者、竭全力以爭之、自一二八後、年不如年、而上下貨物已</p>
<p>一落萬丈</p>
<p>比較四年之前、不足五分之二、允其是本年航運之銳落、其主要原因、固爲社會紹濟枯竭沿江各處之人民、購買力已大減、往年辦貨者尙可得銀行錢莊之流通、而受貨者亦能出貨後付欵、故往來貨物、猶不致困阻、本年銀錢業旣限制放欵、而各貨品更須</p>
<p>現金成交</p>
<p>遂令辦貨之客家、受金融縛束、採運不能空談、此為長江航運銳退之最大原因、長江六公司輪船、已經連連虧本三年、去歲改變主張、同盟公攤以後、貨脚固已提高、回佣又復减少、無如來去貨不如往年、縱使公攤、亦仍虧折、今六公司叉欲將取消之淺水水脚一成、</p>
<p>增加運費　之內、以資補救、但裝箱之量尺貨、已根本爲不入公攤同盟之揚子公司輪與客家之改運郵包·及帆船·火車等奪去、以致本街貨運往長江者更少、四月分起、六公司中之某大公司江輸、每决開出、甚至祇運一成至二成儎脚、即最佳者亦不過四成與五成貨物、記者叩詢該路各報關行、據稱、長江報關行、向來代客報裝貨件、應納關稅、年分三次决繳付、今海關之新章、改爲</p>
<p>稅銀月繳　各報關有不勝填欵付稅之力者祇得減少其營業、此亦長江貨運減少之一原因也、尤有一事、為國糖之運入長江者、向均大批、今因走私之糖價格大落、國糖在長江銷路無形中亦蒙打擊、照例漲水期內、江輪營業、正當起色、今歲則異是、苟夏歷四月分不能轉機、則本年長江輪之匕半年營業、巳無希望矣、至於下水來貨、自九江·蕪湖·長沙·等埠禁米出境以後、雜糧下運已無、獨</p>
<p>日商江輪　因其轉口貨來去均有而且甚多、近來在全部長江船中日本輪之營業、不論公攤與否、均占第一位、中長江則長沙一路比較稍好、而漢口官昌間以運入四川之轉船貨多、更爲優越、上海直航重慶船、因邇因蔣院長到川一决、貨乃大擁、三北之富陽輪、二號開渝、昨日已經滿儎、後來報裝者、甚至無地位容積、</p>

<p>引言</p>
<p>溯自上屆股東總會後瞬又一年猶憶上屆營業報告書會略述本行努力改進之方針期有裨於經濟好轉之擘畫今茲時序推衍檢閱過去一年中工作之成績與興革事項之决第實施固已就抱定之方針爲逐步之推進而時會艱難仍未能盡如所期惟此一年中國際金融政策激盪愈烈國內金融制度之轉變允爲我國經濟史上之創錄本行當此時會體念使命之重惟有就調劑金融發展實業之職責上努力進行期有補於事功而副政府及社會之屬望凡所措施悉本素旨力求穩健俾於勇往邁進之中仍不失審慎推行之意此則差堪告慰於我股東者茲列舉國內外經濟槪况並略述本行業務展進情形以及今後努力之動向幸垂察焉</p>
<p>一　國內外經濟槪況</p>
<p>年來國內經濟依然凋敝金融業務仍難發展凡此事實之所昭示率無以饜吾人夙昔之期望固矣卽論國外經濟軍需工業特殊發展景氣指數雖已多有增進而金本位國與非金本位國之貨幣競爭一如上年之互相對立世界金銀繼續集中於美國者仍復有加無已因此之故各國之經濟政策殆無不注重於貨幣制度之改進我國因亦以救濟工商與實施法幣爲全年之中心工作試分述之</p>
<p>甲　國際經濟</p>
<p>過去一年間國際經濟情形略見起色各國生產消費及物價等指數已見增漲惟國際貿易進步尚覺紆緩統制產業提高關稅等方法仍繼續施行貨幣戰爭且愈益劇烈綜觀國際情形勢將共趨於管理通貨及穩定幣值之一途茲請先言美國</p>
<p>美國上年通過購銀法案規定金銀準備須符合三與一之比例或提高銀價至鑄幣平價每盎司一元二角九分本年此項計劃依然進行白銀價格自五角四分八七五繼續上漲洎及四月美政府又於一個月內兩决提高銀價初爲七角一分繼達七角七分五七加以投機家之乘機購進遂漲至八角一分之高峯各國白銀一致外流致意大利及墨西哥相率禁銀出口而墨西哥更宣布白銀國有金本位集團亦有不易維持之勢美政府鑒此情形雖依其法案尚須購銀十四萬萬元亦不得不稍稍緩和局勢因於五月間下令禁止外國銀幣進口並變更其購銀方法銀價始趨下游以迄年終乃見四角九分七五之低價總計一年以內美國所購白銀竟達五萬四千三百八十萬盎司比上年多近一倍</p>
<p>美國購銀情形旣如上述至於金鎊集團之英國則仍循行其一九三一年放棄金本位時所採取之政策繼續貶低幣值至本年末金鎊對法郎匯價已低落百分之四十有奇</p>
<p>至歐洲其他維持金本位國家在年內大抵遭逢極嚴重之金融恐慌相率採用貨幣緊縮政策顧以國內經濟凋敝出口貿易不振雖多方限制外貨輸入而資金仍不免於外流加以歲初法國發生政變意阿風雲日緊歐洲局勢愈趨不安法比荷瑞諸國資金源源逃避至三月間比國遂不得小降落比幣平價百分二十八以資挽救荷幣更呈動搖法郞受此影響亦復不易維持雖一再提高利率仍無效果幸經英美及國際淸算銀行一致援助始歸平靜然在四五六三個月中其存金已减少一一，六一八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇法郞嚴重情形可以概見</p>
<p>夫國際之繁榮繫於其貿易之發展而穩定匯價實爲發展國際貿易之唯一途徑各國金融之激動殊不利於經濟之復興以是本年五月美國務院宣言認國際間通貨之穩定實爲美國對外貿易計劃中之重要部份同時其國會中且有授權總統召開國際會議之提議六月巴黎舉行之國際商會亦通過勸告各國力謀國際匯兌穩定之議案七月美銀行家摩根復至倫敦與英首相作合力穩定匯價之會談凡此計劃果能實現不獨世界繁榮之所繫亦我國經濟之利也</p>
<p>乙　國內經濟</p>
<p>上半年國內經濟外仍受美國購銀之影響內復有各地水災之損失以致經濟恐慌益趨嚴重生產銳减物價慘落農產輸出亦見衰退現銀外流仍難禁絕通貨緊縮稅收短少不僅工商業日益凋敝銀錢業亦殊覺難以應付</p>
<p>政府有鑒於斯深知補救之不容稍緩旣於二月頒布獎勵白銀復進口辦法復於四月與外商銀行締結停止運銀出口協定局勢因以和緩不意四月末旬之初滬市某兩匯劃莊相繼停業市情陡感緊張錢業週轉復陷竭蹶由本行及中央中國等三行拆放救濟勉克維持迨至五月靑島等地又發生提存風潮上海天津寗波廣州各處之銀錢業亦多有停業改組者政府乃撥付金融公債二千五百萬元由錢業監理委員會具領另組銀團拆放委員會辦理拆放此外更指撥國庫證券二千萬元成立工商業貸欵委員會分別實施救濟難關始得安渡五底以後市悄仍少鬆動劃頭加水恒盤旋於七角之最高峯各方鑒於處境之艱窘深知信用制度之改善不容或緩允非壓平劃頭加水將無以穩定入心因此本行與中國銀行對於各行莊需要劃頭者表示儘量予以調劑並經銀錢兩業公會洽定辦法以本行及中國銀行爲匯劃票據集中交換人於是缺單各莊可以押品向　庫押借劃頭加水始得逐步趨鬆同時商會及銀行業復有承兌匯票之提倡市情乃漸漸活動</p>
<p>顧上文所述猶屬治標之法迨十一月三日政府頒佈改革幣制之緊急法令規定以中央中國交通三銀行所發行之鈔券爲法幣設立發行準備管理委員會統一發行集中準備凡持有銀幣銀類者應一律掉換法幣行使並由中央中國交通三銀行無限制買賣外匯進行頗見順利上海外商銀行亦多表示合作發行準備管理委員會隨於十一月五日成立所有停止發行各銀行之發行準備及其巳印未發已發收回之鈔票指定由本行及中央中國等三銀行分別接收並收兌各地現銀</p>
<p>此項新幣制實爲政府改善財政經濟全盤計劃之發端其第一效果卽爲穩定對外匯率决則爲物價逐漸上漲外匯市價迄至年底固未嘗有何變動卽以物價論十二月份之上海躉售物價比九月份漲百分之十三，四輸出物價漲百分之十九·四輸入物價漲百分之十七·二此項物價之升漲對於進出口貿易之影饗可於冬季三個月之進出口貿易差額覘之十月份入超爲一二，七七六，〇二三元十一月份則减爲一二，二〇三，一四一元然其中尚有十一月份以前訂購之貨物十二月份則已轉爲出超五，三五一，四二七元從此努力改進國內經濟未始無繼續好轉之望也</p>
<p>綜觀國內外之經濟情勢錯綜繁賾固不僅限於上文所述而國際匯市之穩定與世界貿易之平衡　爲世界景氣昭蘇之要素我國經濟界恢復繁榮之基礎暨銀行業各項業務之發展亦將於此覘之矣</p>
<p>二　營業情形</p>
<p>本行爲發展全國實業之銀行就所負使命言對各業有維護調劑之職責就整個金融言對同業亦以互助合作爲原則一年以來國內經濟情况之嚴重已如上述金融百業有待於救濟匡扶者益亟其所屬望於本行者自亦愈殷事艱任巨深恐應付之難周故一方則吸收游資充厚力量一方則擇其急要分途進行經營雖覺非易成效尚有可覩茲將本年度營業情形分述於决</p>

<p>（二）匯欵　本行二十四年度匯出匯欵總額爲四萬五千七百零四萬九千餘元比較二十三年度計增一萬六千六百萬七千餘元比較二十二年度計增二萬四千六百四十二萬五千餘元買入匯票總額爲二萬九千三百三十一萬八千餘元比較二十三年度計增一萬一千五百六十四萬一千餘元比較二十二年度計增一萬八千七百零九萬八千餘元此爲顯著之進步蓋溝通匯兌以輔助產美金融之流動爲本行素所注意本年行處續有增設通匯地點分布益廣幷力求手續之簡捷顧客之便利自幣制變更以後各地匯欵復一律免水調撥周轉愈形靈活遂得有期成績</p>
<p>本年度匯出匯欵及買入匯票减少者僅長浙兩區其原因則長區由於當地管理匯兌影響及於欵項之調撥浙區由於甬埠錢業風潮致資金匯出之縮减但合兩區共减之數尚不敵滬區所增之什一餘如港厦津島漢鄭諸區復有巨額之增加均可見本年度匯欵業務孟晋之一斑也</p>

<p>由上觀察本年度對於各項貸品之投資不獨數額可觀卽分配亦至勻稱此後環境所許自當於此方面益求推展其决瞪券押欵一項所以增加較巨者因本年政府積極進行各項建設發行公債由本行承受抵押者較多幷爲維繫國信及恊助同業調劑市面起見債券押欵套利亦有承做本行以地位及使命所在俱爲不可少之投資又自幣制變更以後經攤放各省維持金融借欽不下數百萬元故機關放欵亦有相當增加至有價證券一項自上屆股東總會議决增資後卽由政府撥到二十四年金融公債票面一千一百萬元如數抵充官股項下新增及未繳資本除以二百萬元轉撥儲蓄部作一爲增加基金外實際投資金額亦增二百三十八萬餘元總之本年度本行放欵與投資并不偏重任何方面凡可以扶助生產及改善金融者無不視其需耍情形盡力以爲之也</p>

<p>五　行務償革及工作情形</p>
<p>關於行務興革及各項工作本年一本已定方針悉力邁進茲述其重要者於决</p>
<p>（一）增資改組　本年三月政府爲調劑金融維護工商起見發行金融公債一萬萬元撥充本行暨中央中國等銀行增加股本等用途當奉政府令准修正交通銀行條例將本行股本總額改爲國幣二千萬元擴充官股一千二百萬元政府前於十七年所認官股至此亦一併以金融公債如數撥足所有股息股權董監名額等幷經改訂仍奉政府特許爲發展全國實業之銀行營業種類幷無重大變更仍受政府委託辦理各項事務幷得受中央銀行之委託辦理之本行職責因是益加重大資力亦倍見增進至於修改之本行章程上届股東總會業經議决通過旋又呈奉財政部令遵修正核准備案</p>
<p>（二）添設機關　本行近年推進業務原以輔助實業平衡都市與內地金融爲主義營業錢網之擴展縱以海岸綫橫以隴海錢爲主要區域所有着手實施情形曾詳上年營業報告本年業務仍依據原定方針努力進行秦晋汴浙閩粵等區之營業機關均經繼續進展或酌加調整東北各地分支行部爲因時制宜起見亦已分別改組或逕予裁撤是以本行新設行處庫部在年內開業者雖多至三十餘處而綜覈現有分支機關之總數幷未遠過於往年蓋機關之增减與全行開支有關開源與節流固應幷重也倉庫在年內仍續有增加新近開業者計有漢陽長沙寗波無錫黃橋淸江浦蚌埠綏遠等八處其餘亦正在建築籌設之中</p>
<p>（三）建築行屋倉庫　現代經濟環境日新不已銀行營業房屋及堆存押品之倉庫均非租賃房舍可盡適用本行建築工程除漢哈魯連島燕等行前已自建新屋南京常熟二支行及上海倉庫等房屋亦於上年新建相繼完成外本年與建之行尾計有鎮江長沙徐州鼓浪嶼等四處倉庫亦有蚌埠長沙寗波西安渭南等五處其工事完成者業已過半購置基地正待設計興工者亦不止一二要之房屋之建築與業務之推進相需甚股固多有不容稍緩之處也</p>
<p>（四）輔助實業　本年自春徂秋國內實業外承國際金融政策之激盪內遴農村災饉之恐慌通貨緊縮營業衰退十一月初因幣制改革之刺激實業界之動態雖漸見活躍但人民之購買力仍未見增進工商業本身亦尚有待乎充實凡此種種情况均巳具如上述本行使命旣在發展實業當此環境自應有適當之輔助綜計一年以來如蠶絲之計劃改良漁業之籌備統制以及農貸合作之分區辦理本行皆協力進行而其間尤注意出口事業之擴展至工商業方面如紡織廠麵粉廠以及化學工廠等倘其營業可期推進而因缺乏流動資金無以展布效能者則酌予貸放使獲周轉其範圍較大需要較鉅須籌統盤計劃方足營運推進者則協助設計使其擬具合理方案或舉發公司債由本行受託承募俾促進其自力更生之本能而完成本行輔助調劑之使命至在本行業務方針上則一本穩健主義求營運之安全幷鑒於我國各種實業半屬新興經營效率或未能盡如預期因復遴派事員於貸放期間隨時稽核庶於調劑經濟之中仍求增進其效率之計此則非特求投資之縝密亦本行對工商業厚望所繫焉</p>
<p>（五）促進建設事業　年來政府對於建設事業勇往邁進諸凡鐵道公路之修築水利堤工之濬治無不高瞻遠矚積極進行凡所措施胥爲復與經濟之基礎工作而在本行之歷史使命上亦夙有悠久之關繫一年以來如江南鐵路京蕪綫之聯絡隴海鐵路西寶段之延長湘黔公路之舖設導淮工程及黃河水利之疏濬凡本行認爲可以改進民生發展生產者靡不竭盡贊襄協助之力以促其成至以前尚未完成之工程如錢塘江大橋之建築引渭渠之開鑿及淮南鐵路煤礦之開發等等則仍按照原議賡續予以協助良以建設事業與實業之發展在在密切之關繫本行使命所在故亦樂於助成也</p>
<p>（六）調劑市面　本年歲序展慕後市情緊張之狀已如前述本行鑒於滬市金融爲全國命脈所寄不容忽視因經與中央中國兩銀行合做拆欵分別拆借各行莊以資周轉幷向香港倫敦方面購入白銀藉以接濟一時市情恐慌之現象始漸敉平迨夏節市面再度緊迫政府急起救濟本行亦會同同業合組銀團舉辦拆放復與中國銀行會同擔任爲匯劃票據集中交換人對各行莊儘量予以調劑始得勉渡難關八月份起本行復與同業合辦工商業貸欵用為較普遍之調劑凡此種種雖僅係適應環境之治標辦法而當彼時銀根奇緊之際得此迥旋之餘地收效實非淺鮮逮新貨幣制度實施以後本行鈔券定爲法幣社會對本行之期望旣更殷切本行亦一體政府方針對各地市况之盈虛消長隨時權衡量予調劑期有補於幣制之推行樹穩固之基礎年底難關藉</p>
<p>（七）擴充信託業務　本行信託業務以前已辦有保管證券代理保險暨經租房地產等服務性質之業務本年以社會對於信託事業之需要漸設而信託事業於本行發展實業之特殊使命關係綦重故特訂定信託章程呈部備案信託基金亦擬另撥事欵獨立辦理以重保障關於各項信託業務之規則幷經參酌各國制度分別訂定體察各分支行所在地需耍情形分別緩急决第實施</p>
<p>（八）人事改進　本行業務旣逐有進展凡屬人事上之設施自不得不設法改良以增效率本年關於人事措置之方針除錄用人員仍兼用考試制度舊有員生嚴加甄別幷另訂退職辦法外其特加注意者（一）爲會計訓練凡上年錄取之特種試用員及原有員生對於會計事務尚少充分之經騐者概入特設之會計訓練班對於全部會計事務自傳票以迄决算無不逐項指導以期諳習俟訓練期滿再派赴分支行實習俾於實際上之技術得以熟練（二）爲工廠實習本行鑒於工廠貸欵首宜明瞭工廠內容是以上年甄用各大學畢業生爲特種試用員時已注意於專門學術之修養本年又更進一步特選派特種試用員前往水泥紙造酸爾化及紡織等工廠考察各該廠之機械設備製造成本以及出品銷售等情形允注重實地之練習現已先後告竣將此項特種試用員派充各項職務（三）爲充實圖書設備現代之銀行行員除相當技術外兼賴平時修養充其學識關於特種事務允不可不有各項書籍以資參考本行圖書室之設備卽本此旨有儲藏圖書本年又續有添置均依新式分類法分類儲藏從此積以歲月當不難蔚為大觀</p>
<p>右列各端增多與本行業務之進展有重要之關係現旣次第實施成效當不無可期惟是經濟事業日新月異本行業務不可不求其與時俱進旣往時期之成就在本行固不容因以自畫耳</p>
<p>六　今後之努力</p>
<p>上述國內經濟事業衰頹之故要言之不外金融緊追產銷停滯二端是以居今日而欲輔助農工商業期其復與其目的固在乎培植生產機能其手段則繫於周轉各業金融而周轉各業金融之法其關於直接作用者爲資金之貸放如農工商各業貸欵屬之關於間接作用者爲業務之推廣如增設營業機關及貨物倉庫等屬之蓋二者之方式雖殊而事業之推廣亦無非運用資金以利農工商業之推進也本行旣往營業及工作情形旣注意於上列二者今後努力之方針亦卽在此試析言之</p>
<p>（一）注重重抵押以調劑市面金融抵押爲通融資金之一法略與貼現相同而期有長短之分貼現票據爲期較短必有藉於重貼現以爲後盾抵押借欵爲期較長亦必有重抵押資其周轉所謂重抵押者卽以一方之抵押債權轉抵押於他方之謂也今日經濟界最大之困難厥惟帳面債權之呆滯而可以互助之資力則至有限今欲充分利用此有限之互助資力以免帳面抵押債權之呆滯除貼現外自不得不依照重貼現之方式舉辦重抵押以充信用市塲之籌碼而促金融之周轉此其一也</p>
<p>（二）注重公司債以扶助牛產事業重抵押之有利於工商業金融旣如上述更進則爲公司債之募集實爲啟發社會企業投資之主要途徑本行修正條例原經規定公司債之經理應募或承受爲營業之一現在協議承辦者亦已不止一二嗣後當更視社會需耍情形力予提倡以促成社會之企業投資但本行此種投資應以生產事業爲限對於公司之組織管理設備成本等項仍不可不詳加研究以期欵不虛投事歸實在而於扶助生產之目的則因以完成此其二也</p>
<p>（三）扶助出口商貨以調整國外貿易</p>
<p>上列二端主在金融之流通以助貨物之產銷固矣但金融流通之效用不可不求其循環於國內而不致流出於國外因此之故扶助貨物產銷應以國產之農業品及工業品爲主對於出口商貨如蠶絲及棉花茶葉以及鑛產等物允擬以種種方式助其推進庶幾出口貿易得以順轉產銷事業隨之增進本行在本年度內對於蠶絲改良茶葉產銷鑛業開發農業合作以及工商貸欵等項之協力提倡已如上述嗣後仍擬賡續邁進益求推廣此其三也</p>
<p>（四）拓展內地業務以扶助農村經濟</p>
<p>扶助農村經濟使都市金融向內地平衡發展原爲本行業務上主要方針之一自幣制變更而後以流通法幣收兌銀元現銀等關係內地分支機關需要益見增多本行分支行辦事處　徧佈各省市現巳達一百一十餘處嗣後當一秉旣定之方針向內地盡力進行其現已着手於調究籌設等工作者業有多處其他各省區亦將逐步擴展俾事業益加推廣而資金之運用亦增其便利此其四也</p>
<p>（五）增設新式倉庫以便利生產運銷</p>
<p>本行辦理倉庫事業歷年已久其在上年度增設擴充者已達七十餘處本年又續有增設不論農工礦產均得儲存本倉押用貨欵是以本行在年內承做之貨物押欵及押匯在放欵總數內佔額最多從前倉庫陋規亦多革除嗣後擬再通盤計劃籌設大規模之倉庫更進而謀大量之運銷並於押欵押匯手續力求便利穩妥以暢貨物之流通此其五也</p>
<p>（六）發展信託事業以完服務社會之任務本行籌辦信託業務之意義旣如上文所述是以擬訂之各項辦法悉以服務社會爲主旨來年經濟環境果有需要之處自當决第見諸實施運用社會之遊資以更新市面之景氣此其六也</p>
<p>以上各項前三項屬於資金之運用後三項屬於事業之推進而一以周轉各業金融培植產銷能力爲主義值茲經濟事業衰頹不振之會雖不敢預期其成效之若何要不得不黽勉以圖之也</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>環顧國內情勢自幣制改革後十二月份對外質易竟突破數十年入超之紀錄一變而爲出超此實爲經濟界久困之餘漸得昭蘇之徵象果能逐步推進則經濟之復興自可預期第默察此决出超之構成要尚由於金融制度之變革輸入量因而减少之效果其經濟事業本身則仍未見長足之展進故目前救濟　金融之惟一要件仍應力求入超之彌補而彌補入超之方法則祇有求生產事業之充量發展金融業方面則應盡量供給資金竭力提倡國產　面並酌量减低存放利率仲籌碼之分配有適當之規劃在工商業本身則更須有澈底之覺悟捐棄近利謀組織之健全與技術之改進允希望政府當局爲進一步之設施對於工商業統制其產銷對於金融業調整其組織生產事業與金融制度相輔並進經濟前途庶幾有復與之望此則本行於報告營業情形之餘所願與全國上下一德一心共力以赴者也</p>

<p>（一）</p>
<p>中國文化建設恊會南京分會、二十四日下午五時三十分、請中央委員雷震在中央廣播電台演購「民族與文化」、茲探錄其原詞於後、一個民族所以能成爲其民族必有其特殊的自然與文化、這是不可動搖的結論、今人一脫到民族似乎是明白不過的概念然若要問淸民族究竟是甚麽則異說紛紜、不可究詰、</p>
<p>由自然方面言之、血統與地域、都是造成民族的重要因素、但是現在所謂民族、無論混雜了多少的異而統於其中、純粹血統的民族、在今日可說是沒有的、地域亦然、中國和英國的人民散處於全世界、而其民族性並沒有消滅、現在一個民族、只住在一個地方的、還是例外哩、今爲題目所限、而族和地域的因索都不能詳說、只論民族與文化的關係、而且今日交通機關進步、人間來往頻繁血統、與地城已不是研究民挨特性重要條件、惟文化是表示民族特徵的重要條件、伯蘭戚利對於民族所下的定義、是「民族是屬特別由言語及習慣所結合的共同精神感情及種族的體統社會的各種職業及社會階級的多數人們的團結、而有一種共同的文明、此文明是特別拋開國家的紐帶、而給他們以統一的觀念、使其與他國人有區別之感、」</p>
<p>文化之中各科學技術經濟學等等、關於理知方面的東西、具有普遍的性質、與民族的關係較小一個民族、儘可以其知職優越於他民族而自豪、但愛護本族的精神、並不能由此而增加知識較低的民族、不僅不因此而自鄙、而且其團結力往往比知識較高的民挨爲允强、個中道理如何、當可曉然而喻了、</p>
<p>初民時代宗敎曾佔絕大的勢力、故宗敎的儀式及信條、往往為決定民族之因素、圖騰社會、無不以宗敎爲中心、民族社會也可說、只有宗敎爲團結的紐帶、但自文明開化以後、以政治經濟及他勢力之伸張、而宗敎的勢力、乃日益縮小歐洲各種民族、同是信奉基督敎、並不能因此而融化成一個大民族、反因各民族之分立、而基督敎內乃生破裂（初分爲希臘正敎與羅馬正敎後、復分爲新敎與舊敎、）中國民族自魏晋以來、不獨儒釋道三敎並列皇帝各給他對號、由人民自由去信奉、即怪誕不經的宗敎也儘可並行不悖而民族、不但不因此而分離、且益加擴大、日趨統一、降自今日、各民族的分立根據宗敎信仰之不同者、惟少數未開化的民族而已、</p>
<p>然則决定民族的因素、最重要的、究是什麼、歷史運命的共同生活方式的一致、語言文字的統一、這三者實居首要、今不論其交互錯綜、且分開三方分別探究之、</p>
<p>第一壓史運命的共同實民族所以形成的基礎、因爲歷史上同休戚共患難、使屬於這一集團的人們、發生共同牛活的意識、於是對內則鞏固其結合、成爲一個單位、對外則以整個力量與他族抗爭、柏蘭戚利有云、「據我們的見解、民族是靈魂是精神、由於記憶過去的犧牲光榮屢遭顯沛及共同悲哀而來的、精神的家族、在現在由於繼續維持共同生活的欲望而來的、精神的家族構成民族的東西、旣不是因爲說同一樣的言語、亦非因其時於同一的種族團體、其在過去共同成就大事業、而在將來尚欲成就大事業、民族是由於歷史深遠的錯綜、而結果的一種精神的原則、我們祖先無論在文化上政治上、均建造了偉大的成績、以爲我民族共同的速繫、同時自有史以來、亦遭受了許多的悲哀、在同期的時候、即受玁狁犬戎等的侵略、秦漢以來、對外交涉日繁最大的慘敗、有三决五胡亂華及元淸入主第一决使中國裂爲南北垂三百年第二决、至於亡國八十餘年第三决、則竟延至二百六十餘年之久、然而久暫雖有不同而休戚相關、則毫無二議、</p>

<h3 id="c149">上海德國學校槪況　（一） <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>上海德僑在滬開辦德國學校一所。該校位於公共租界西區大西路一號；規模宏大，設備完美。本文承該校校長韋勃爾博士多方供給材料，並承惠贈該校槪　其紀念刊各一册，至爲感謝！</p>
<p>一，遠東最老的德國學校</p>
<p>上海德國學校開辦迄今已有四十一年的歷史。在一八九四年的夏天，一位德國宣敎師招收了一打左右的德國兒童在他的家庭敎讀。不久學生人數增至二十左右；於是乃籌備開辦學校。經過積極的進行，遠東饅老的德國學校乃於一八九五年四月一日正式成立了。最初該校只有三位敎師，二十三個學生；後來逐漸發展，至一九〇〇年時，學生人數增　到四十餘人。不久德國禮拜堂興工，乃决定在禮拜堂後面興建校舍一所；到一九〇一年秋，該校乃遷入自建的校舍開學。</p>
<p>幾年以後，學校繼續發達，原有校舍不敷應用。月舊校各項設備不合衛生，父無運動場；學生散課後常在街道上遊戲，殊屬不當。到一九〇五　，德皇威廉　世舉行銀婚紀念，滬上德僑乃捐資祝賀。德皇鑒於滬上德僑入學的子弟衆多，而又無新式的校舍，乃决定將德僑所獻的賀禮賜還德僑在滬購地一方，以作興建新校舍的用途。於是在九〇六年，滬上德僑在大西路（現在校址）購地十餘畝，並决定將未來之德國新校舍命名爲德皇威廉學校，（Kaiser-Wilhelm）用以紀念德皇捐地的美意。</p>
<p>自後該校過種種的變遷和發展；現在提出幾件重要的事實敘述出來。以前該校校務是與禮拜堂堂務合併處理，雙方均感不　；到一九〇八年，該校乃與敎堂分離，行政完全獨立。後來經過種種的困難與努力，該校新校舍乃於一九一一年四月二十三日在大西路上正式落成。是日全滬德僑均來該校新校舍舉行慶祝大會。同年，决添建幼稚園一間。斯時，全校學生人數已增加到一百餘人。一九一四年歐戰爆發。到一九二二年二月，該校始行恢復常態。</p>
<p>一九　八年，德僑認爲原有校舍又不够學校發展之用，乃决定將舊校舍拆去，重建大規模的新校舍。一九二九年五月，規模宏大的新校舍　成，該校的基礎到道時才算是鞏固了。學校編制現有幼稚園一年，小學四年，文科中學九年。該校現爲德國政府承認，學生在中學畢業後可以參加德國國家考試。該校現有學生二百六十人，男生一百四十人，女生一百二十人；其中有九十人係非德國籍學生而願意進入該校肄業者。校中敎師共有十八人，內專任者十四人，兼任者四人。該校設立的目的是在使滬上德僑子弟避免外國敎育的影響，而供給他們一種吸收德國的科學與智識的機會，可以成爲德國有用的公民。該校能有今日爲成功當可表現德國僑民堅強的意志與不斷的的努力；同時，在富有國際性的上海環境中，該校的成立亦可增進德國的國際平等地位。</p>

<p>— 蘇子涵</p>
<p>在明朝快要亡的時候，蘇州洞庭山出了一個很有義氣的打柴的人，大家都不知道他姓甚名誰，因爲他的身體高大，一部絡腮鬍子，就都叫他髯樵。髯樵的氣力很大，別人只背得了一百斤，他可以背二百四十斤，但是他仍然照一百斤的價賣。有人間他爲甚麼道麽辦，他說：「反正柴是從山裏打來的，只靠氣力，不用本錢，我雖然氣力大，但是我的食量並不比別人大，何必多賣錢呢」</p>
<p>髯樵是個目不識丁的人，但是喜歡聽別人談論古來的事，因爲他的生性直爽，所以就喜歡忠臣義士，恨好臣小人。有時批評古來人的是非，說得很對，讀醫明禮的人也不過那樣</p>
<p>有一次村裏唱戲，髯樵從山裏打柴回來，從戲憂底下過，臺上正在唱精忠傅，秦檜剛好出來。那扮秦檜的做得盡情盡緻，簡直是一個活奸臣。髯樵看了，忍不住心頭火發，一個飛步就跳上了戲臺，把那個扮秦檜的戲子一掌打翻，按在裏上，拳頭脚尖如雨點般打下去，打得頭破血出。旁邊的人好容易才勸住了。髯樵還大叫道：「他做了丞相，却這樣陷害忠良，把國也誤了，不打死嫌他命長！」</p>
<p>旁邊有人說：「這是唱戲，是假的啊。」</p>
<p>髯樵說：「我知道是假的，才打他，如果是眞的，我早把他砍了！」</p>
<p>髯樵也不迷信，他有個哥哥去朝茅山，掉在山崖底下跌死了，有些迷信得很利書的人說，因爲他哥哥吃了酒，不誠心，被王靈官用金鞭打死的。髯樵聽了這話，便連日連夜趕到茅山去，故意吃得大醉，跑到殿上，指着王靈官的神像大罵道：「你這東西眞不是東西」，借着祖師的幌子，在這裏作威作福！我哥哥前來進香，本是好心，吃了酒也不犯死罪，你幹嗎把他殺了。我今天不但不進香，還是吃了酒來的，看你敢把我怎樣！敢殺我嗎？哼，料想你也不敢。你瞪着眼，橫着鞭瞧着我幹甚麽？好罷，將就你的鞭打碎你道狗娘養的」！</p>
<p>髯樵剛一說完，就要跳上去要奪王靈官手裏的鞭，圍在旁邊的香客們拼死拼活才把他擋着了。過後，髯樵就把自己哥哥的尸首搬了回來。</p>
<p>那時洞庭山住了一姓陳的，名叫學奇，父母雙亡，自小就定下一個姓鄒的女子爲妻。已經定了日子，快要結婚了，誰知鄒姑娘的哥哥忽然變卦，嫌貧愛富起來，不許鄒姑娘嫁給陳家，却把她獻與蘇州城裏一個大鄉紳做姨太太。陳學奇知道了這事，急得甚麼似的，就跑進城裏去告狀。誰知官官相護，官也怕那位大鄉紳的聲勢，不敢怎樣；陳學奇又告鄒姑娘的哥哥，官也不准，反轉把他趕了出來。這種事，官都不理，誰還敢出頭？急得陳學奇上天無路，入地無門。</p>
<p>一天，陳學奇在路上碰見了髯樵，就把道件事情告訴他了，並且說：「久聞老丈很購義氣，肯帮人的忙。現在小子遇見這樣痛心的事，老丈能够替小子想法嗎？</p>
<p>髯樵想了一想，就說：「好罷。可是這事不是三天兩天就可以辦得了的，你得等。」</p>
<p>陳學奇聽見髯樵應允，趕忙跪下磕頭說：「老丈眞是好人！小子如果能同妻子見面，那，老丈眞是小子的重生父母了。」</p>
<p>髯樵說：「言重！言重，這算不得甚麽。」他一面說，一面就把陳學奇扶了起來。</p>
<p>髯樵雖然目不識丁，却也是一個精細人，他知道耍救鄒姑娘，必得要到那大鄉紳家裹去。像大鄉紳那樣的門戶，不是輕易進得去的，但是髯樵有法子。</p>
<p>髯樵跑到城裏去，找到一個人販子家，假意說自巳是來找人家帮工的，自己有的是氣力，頂好做轎夫。過後不久，髯樵果然到大鄉紳家裏去當轎夫了；因爲他的氣力大，做事又勤快，大鄉紳很喜歡他，就是內堂也讓他隨便出入。</p>
<p>過了一些日子，髯樵已經知道三姨太太就是鄒姑娘；等一有機會，就要同她商議了。</p>
<p>一天，髯樵在後院碰兌鄒姑娘，那時四下無人，正是說話的機會。鬆樵趕忙走到她身傍去，低低說道：「鄒姑娘，你現在過活得到很舒服，可還記得陳郞嗎？</p>
<p>鄒姑娘忽然看見一個不認識的老頭兒向她說這話，不覺大驚，說：「老丈是誰？」</p>
<p>髯樵說：「姑娘，你不認識我嗎？我是髯樵，是陳郞請我來打探姑娘消息的。陳郎很想念你呢！」</p>
<p>鄒姑娘定了一定神，說：「老丈，我那裏又把陳郞丟得下！我本來想尋一條死路，不從那天殺的，無奈他的人多，他叫人把我手脚綁了，剝了我的衣褲，那晚上就破了我的身子。我眞對不住陳郞！老丈來了就好了，千萬望老丈，把我救出去，同陳郞見得一面，我死也甘心！」說着，就哭了起來</p>
<p>髯樵連忙說：「姑娘不必如此，耳目眾多，我反正盡心就是了。」</p>
<p>過了很久，一天，大鄉紳的夫人要帶衆姨太太去遊天平山，髯樵知道了，就心裏暗想：「機會來了！」就先到河邊去把船僱好，才轉去抬轎子，他有意抬第三乘，裹面坐的就是鄒姑娘。那一個轎夫也是髯樵買囑好了的。</p>
<p>一出城，髯樵就走上另一條岔路，如飛一般的朝河邊趕去，那些跟去的僕人們看見事情不對，也呼嘯着趕了來。髯樵趕到河邊，放下轎子，把鄒姑娘攙出來，又攙上船去，追趕的人也追到了。那一個轎夫早走了，髯樵回身轉去，奮起神威，三拳兩脚的打倒三四個人，別的人也跑了，髯樵才回船上，駕起風帆，順風走了，等到第二批人趕來的時侯，風順水急，髯樵已經把鄒姑娘送到陳學奇家裏了。</p>
<p>陳學奇夫婦見了面，那悲喜的樣兒就不用提，只感激髯樵就感激得入了命裏。出了道件事，髯樵重義氣，救人急的聲名更大了。</p>
<p>又過了幾年，李闖王把北京打破了，崇禎皇帝也在楳山上品死了。村子裏的人都在說：「李自成做了皇帝了！」</p>
<p>髯樵起初聽見了還不相信，問了幾個人，都是一樣說法。髯樵氣得火星直冒，暴跳如雷，大叫道：「我只知道皇帝姓朱，李自成是甚麼東西，也要做皇帝。我的皇帝到那兒去了，清朝文武，竟沒有一個人救皇帝嗎？這些只知道吃飯拿錢難道還去給賊人做百姓嗎？萬歲爺，我老了，不能够殺賊，只好一死來報答你了！萬歲爺，你等等，我來了！」</p>
<p>髯樵一口氣跑到太湖邊上，看了看那浩浩蕩蕩的水，又仰面大叫了三聲「天！」撲通一聲就跳下太湖裹去，擾着起了一陣泡，髯樵就算完了。髯樵死的時候，已經六十幾歲了。</p>
<h3 id="c175">司蒂芬孫George　Stevenson（1781-1848） <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 李季珍</p>
<p>他從一個最小的礦工做到工程師，從一字不識字做到大科學家，沒有別的秘訣，只是：</p>
<p>學怎樣做——只怕自己不懂</p>
<p>問爲什麼——不怕別人嘲笑</p>
<p>司蒂芬孫於公元一七八一年六月九日，生在英國紐喀斯爾（Now　Cautle）附近一個鄉村裏。他的父親是一個石炭礦工，掙來的錢，還不够維持一家的衣食，見女敎育當然沒法顧到。司蒂芬孫，九歲那年便被追去當牧童來减輕父親的負擔。過了幾年，父親領他到礦裏做點散工，擔任擦汽機的職務。他一面擦汽機，一面考察牠的結構，很快便熱識了。他拿泥土來做成各種機器的模型，做得又像又好，誰看了也贊美他手巧。</p>
<p>確裏的辦事人看見他精細而耐勞，很喜歡他，升他做管吸水機的。礦裏最一可怕的是水，水如果不吸收起來，讓牠漲着，馬上可以成災，淹死了礦工，衝壤了礦產，有毀滅整個工程的可能。那時幸虧瓦特（James　Watt）已經發明了吸水機，費用少，效能高，爲礦裏預防水患的唯一利器。司蒂芬孫做了吸水機工人，看見吸水機自動上落的工作情形，他很驚奇，整天痴想道：「爲什麼爐裏火，能够使鍋裏的水變成汽呢？爲什麼水汽能使整個機器轉動呢？」他自己苦心焦思想不出道理來，只得請敎別的同事工人，問了幾個人都是不懂得這個道理，有一天他活該倒霉，向着一個老成的工人。那老頭子瞪了他一眼，罵道：「小孩子胡扯什麼！你這樣胡思亂想，不老老實實工作，誰願意雇你？看罷，你一定不到我的年紀就會俄死了。」過了一回，他又很得意的伸出三個手指對司蒂芬孫說道：「我做了三十年工人，未會失業過一天，完全因爲我安分守巳，什麼事情也不管，不向高處爬，不往好處想。好孩子，你學我罷！」</p>
<p>司蒂芬孫聽了很生氣，忍不住反駁他道：「得咯，學你！學你有什麼出息？一個人做人總要做一點有出息的事，怎能一輩子做麵包的奴隸呢？」那位老工人想不到這孩竟敢拿言語來頂撞他，馬上老羞成怒起來，一把抓住司蒂芬孫的頭髮問道：「有出息的孩子，你說呀！你說呀！什麽是有出息的事情？」司蒂芬孫不想和他爭執，忙擺脫了他的手，掉頭跑出去。不想他胃冒失失的，走不上幾十步，竟和一個工程師撞一個滿懷。那工程師以爲司蒂芬孫是在鬧什麼亂子，並不接受他的道歉，把他喚回來。那位老工人遠遠看見了很高興，他想這孩子這一决可該把飯碗打破了。誰知那位工程師查明白了這件事情的原委之後，很喜歡司蒂芬孫這樣好學，替他解答道：「水受熱便會成汽，汽有力，能推動機輸，使整個機器轉動。這條單簡的蒸汽原理，早已由瓦特說明，可惜你不認識字，所以不知道。你最好能抽出一點功夫念書去，世界上一切重要的道理都在書本裏，你不念書便不會領略得到的。」</p>
<p>此時司蒂芬孫已經十九歲了，一個字也不認識，他聽了那工程師的話，心裹很難受，放工回來，整夜想着這件事情不能睡覺。他自己罵自己道：「我們大家都不識字，都是蠢人。蠢人比蠢人，不會高明得多少的，我今天何必和那老頭兒爭執呢？我要幹些有出息的事情，可是不識字便不明白道理，那裏能幹什麽呢」？他恨自己不識字，不能幹有出息的事情，擰自己，槌自己，像一個瘋子一樣。最後他想通了，很高興的跳起床說道：「急甚麽？趕緊念書就是了。現在我雖然已經十九歲了，如果我能够比人加倍用功，十年後我可不是能够趕上和我同年的讀書男子嗎」？他於是發憤求學，日間到礦裏作工，晚上進夜學讀書。和六七歲大的小孩同班開蒙，小孩看見他這樣大才開始讀書，都笑着呌他做「大傻瓜」。他念書從ABC讀起，學算從一二三起頭。他直着顙子發音，念起書來像呌賣一樣，惹得敎員同學都忍不住笑。他一心要借讀書的能力來帮助能去幹有出息的事情，因此他什麽也不管，不害羞，不怕難，只知道低下頭苦不這。因為他的非常用功，當然會得到非常的進步。不上幾年，他什麼科學原理都懂得了。於是他認定科學發明是一件最有出息的事，開始研究汽機了。</p>
<p>從前他對於瓦特的吸水機，驚爲神奇：現在他經過一番研究，覺得牠太粗陋了。有一天他對從前勸過他讀書那位工程師說道：「先生，您看，瓦特的吸水機永遠不能把水完全吸乾的。您知道這個原因嗎」？工程師還以爲司蒂芬孫又因爲無知提出帶傻氣的問題來，笑道：「我若是知道牠的原因，我也是發明家了」。司蒂芬孫聽見工程師這樣說，反不好意思說出原因來。最後他，忍不住緘默了，大胆地把工程師引到吸水機前面，指出這裏那裏的缺點，並且說明怎樣可以改良的。工程師覺得司蒂芬孫所說的也有些理由，答應給他一個試騐的機會。工程師走後，司蒂芬孫的同事圍着笑他道：「朋友，你不過是一個工人，又不是工程師，不要不自量惹人笑話罷。改良機器？許多頂瓜瓜的大工程師也沒有辦法，你少做做春夢罷」！</p>
<p>司蒂芬孫曉得和無知識的入瞎爭是無用的，他只笑笑，什麽話也不說，等大衆散工去了，他才開始做他的實騐。過了幾天，礦裏乾乾的，沒一點積水，一切工人都因此工作便利。他們又奇怪又高興，四處去打聽誰幹了這偵探好事情。等到他們發覺是司蒂芬孫改良了吸水機，誰都失驚起來。此後不但沒人（當然從前得罪過司蒂芬孫的老工人也在內）不敬重司蒂芬孫，就是工人自己也曉得自重了。礦主知道司蒂芬孫是一個有爲的人，馬上升他做總機師。</p>
<p>礦裏還有一種可怕的災難——水災。那裏礦裏所用的是蠟燭，火焰無遮攔，常常會和暴烈性或燃燒性强的氣體接觸，發生爆炸或大火，往往死人無算。司蒂芬孫爲着愛護他的同事，和報答礦主的知遇，發明了一種保安燈來替代蠟燭。但他認爲這也不過是他的初步研究的成績，他不肯因此自滿。他要做一件大出色的事情，做一個大發明家。於是日日夜不斷的努力研究蒸汽機，結果費了十五年功夫，發明了火車和鐵路，利便全世界的交通，使人類的文明加速的進步。他的功勞，眞是「不可以道里計」呢。</p>

<h3 id="c176">關於敎科書問題 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 周寒梅</p>
<p>現在的各大中小學校關於敎科書的問題，確實已到了很嚴重的地步，不論文科或理科，當學校當局或任課敎員在選擇他某一學科的敎科書的時候，總覺得萬分困難而不易得到圓滿的結果。同時勉強選擇到了一種比較適用的敎科書，在事實上，不獨敎者仍感到痛苦，就是學者也覺得有種種毛病而不起學習的興趣來，因此而影響到一般大中小學校學生的程度，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>關於中小學校的敎科書，在編製的時候雖然有敎育部頒佈的課程標凖可資遵循，但這課程標準僅有原則上的指示，一切材料之選擇取捨之權，還是在於編製者的自身；同時每一種敎科書固然都須送呈敎育部審查，但審查的主要點，還是在消極方面着眼，例如有否違反課程標進等，所以敎科書之優良與吾，其關鍵完全在編製者的身上。</p>
<p>現在，姑且以中等學校的國文敎科書而言，其內容之貧乏與枯燥，實在出人意料之外。關於白話文方面的，那麽不是一二十年以前的啟蒙時代的作品，便是拮据敖牙的譯文。關於文言文方面的，那麽古文觀止，戰國策，離騷，史記上的文章，便大量採入。致於最近十年內的文獻，簡直百不得一，於是中學生的作文便大感困難了。初中學生多讀白話文的，寫出來的文章也學了那拮据敖牙的譯文，形容月光會從水銀一直寫到霓虹燈，形容走路會從柳枝的搖擺一直寫到燒香老婆了，高中學生多讀文言文的，旣追不上唐宋八大家的文氣於千萬分之一，更談不到離騷與史記的筆法，簡直一篇通順的報章置的文言文也不可得。說到這裏，筆者不得不鄭重聲明，並不是說現在國文敎科書上的文章一概要不得，祗是說為什麼不把現代的文獻多多採入以爲中學生吟誦的文章呢？爲什麽全部採用了離開現代思想少則二十手，多則數千年的文章給中學生精讀呢？同時編製的體裁也滑稽萬分，編輯敎科書的先生們不知爲了方便敎員們呢？還是取悅於學生？往往把難字難句，一一註音釋義，於是敎員旣不必準備，學生們的字典也就可以省買一部，我不知道這種辦法於中學生究竟有益還是有害？再以中學校的地理敎科書而言，關於物產部份，總是「煤鐵甚富」「銻，鉛，等鑛甚爲富饒一，統計的數字是百不可得一的，難道在中國眞的一點統計數字都找不到嗎？其他如歷史敎科書，關於古代社會的敘述，不着眼於科學上的說明，還是說什麼開天闢地；朝代的變革，不從社會經濟制度上着眼，還是記了一篇帝皇家的流水賬，諸如此類，何可勝言！這種敎科書，不謂爲誤人子弟，胡可得耶？這是從中學敎科書的內容而言，其他若大學小學的敎科書，假定稍加檢閱，問題當然也很多，亟待縝密的研究和改正。至於敎科書定價之昂貴，也值得我們嚴重注意，現在一本一百頁左右的敎科書，定價少則五六角，多則七八角，上下兩冊，往往就需要一元四五角左右，這對於一般中人階級的子弟，都是一層很大的困難。</p>
<p>大中小學的敎科書所以如是槽，我覺得也有一定的原因，出版機關爲了商業上的競爭或經濟上的打算起見，不是因時間關係而粗製滥造，便是報酬關係而不克敦聘學識經騐俱富之士，於是造成了今日的現象。在大中小學校擔任敎科的優良的敎師，往往爲了生活的鞭策而無暇及此，於是敎者旣不能有相當的貢獻，而出版界方面也不能有美滿的成績表現。</p>
<p>關於敎科書問題，筆者常常有一個夢想，現在不妨寫在這裏，以供敎育行政當局的參考：我覺得要希望大中小學校的敎科書優良，最高敎育行政機關應該負起一種責任來的，就是編製敎科書的工作由政府負責，劃全國各省市爲幾個敎育區（區的劃分以文化程度之異同爲原則），在每一個敎育區中設立一隻國立的大學，國立的中學，和國立的小學，敎員的待遇儘量的抬高，授課的鐘點儘量的减少，並且耍給他職業上的保障，把編製大中小學校敎科書的責任完全交給他們，在一年或二年的光陰中，把大中小學的敎科書編製完成以後，一方面交給中國的大出版機關發行，一方面請全國的大中小學校裏的敎師們嚴格的批評，這幾套敎科書當然並不是一成不變，以爲各敎育區的定本，而是每年要修改，每年要補充筆者深信，祇須辦法縝密，而選才謹嚴，嚴重的敎科書問題一定可以解决，而且可以達到我們理想的境界。</p>

<p>——第二决世界大戰的危機，顯然巳到臨頭了，各國軍備的努力擴充，軍需工業的日增月盛，戰時準備的積極躍進，一切的紛爭，一切的矛盾，都需要戰爭來一個總解决，總淸算。雖然全世界人士鑒於第一决世界大戰的殘酷，犧牲，與可怕，都有畏懼戰爭的心理，然而道第二次决大戰是吾爆發，並不决定於一般人士是吾畏懼戰同，而是决定於一般大財閥的利益，和野心家的意向上的。同時在這地球的東西方，都聞有一個火藥庫將一觸即發不，不過東方的火藥庫比西方的知要嚴重危急到多少倍我們爲了國家的命運，民族的生存，全國人士都應該開始一個非常時期的準備了，那麽决定戰爭全局勝負的戰時經濟學，實有深刻研究的必要。</p>
<p>徐宗士先生譯的A.C.Pigou　的「戰時經濟學」，雖然原著者不脫自由主義經濟學的窠臼，而旦是偏重於歐洲時英國的情狀，不論時或地都有相去太遠之感，不過這實際的敎訓，總是非常值得寶貴的一頁。而且包羅豐富，理論周詳，允非一般普通紀敘歐洲時的經濟金融狀况的專籍，所可得而相提並論。所以筆者認爲這本書實有鄭重介紹於一般讀者的必要。</p>
<p>該書的內容，分爲下列十八章：第一，導言；第二，戰爭的影響；第三，戰爭的經濟原因；第四，戰爭的資源；第五，戰爭底實在的和貨幣的犧牲與費用；第六，個人撙節的選擇；第七，政府的徵發；第八，賦稅與公債；第九，募集自由公債的方法；第十，製造銀行信用以籌戰費的方法；第十一，物價統制；第十二，消費者的定量分配，第十三，優光權與工廠購備原料的定量；第十四，補助金；第十五，通貨與滙兌的善後，第十六，輸入品，與國外投費的管理；第十七，內債的善後，第十八，戰後的政府統制問題。在這十八章中，作者對理論與實際，變方兼顧，詳爲闡揚，雖然大多偏重於英國的狀然，不過可資爲我國借鏡者，正在在皆是。該書有二四二頁，多十萬言，定價一元三角，商務出版。</p>

<p>——一個建議——</p>
<p>出版界的荒凉是一個事實，近年來不論哲學科學文學等沒有偉大的著作出現也是一個事實，它的原因固然很多，不過，筆者以為除掉消極的批判和積極的指導以外，政府方面應該有設置「出版獎金」的必要。</p>
<p>無論那一個國家，假定對於文化事業相當一注意的，那麽對於學術方面的津貼補助等物質的奬勵，一定不還餘力，然而在中國，目前尚沒有這種辦法，這我們不能不認爲是一個很大的缺憾！</p>
<p>據筆者的見地，我國政府應該設置「出版獎金」，內分哲學，政治，經濟，敎育，國際，化學，物理，文學等部門，凡在一年度內，倘有上列各種專門理論上闡揚的書籍，而內容非常優秀，經專家審定合格的，那麼除掉著作人得到獎金外，出版機關也應該予以物質上的獎勉。</p>
<p>它的好處，可以使出版機關格外奮勉於自己的事業，著作人格外努力於自己的研究，而全國的學術風氣也可以提高而養成。</p>

<h3 id="c179">人力車夫福利會 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>本月初曾因車商不滿於工部局當局堅決實行減租，而至停放車輛罷業以示反對。一連三日的人力車夫風潮，至四日車商接受減辦法，方始恢復秩序，但雙方損失巳達十餘萬元。車商方面是咎由自取，用不着說。至於拉一天吃一天的人力車夫，因車商停放車輛致無形失業，這個損失是不可以計算的。當時與論界都一致對操縱及利用人力車夫的雙方表示不滿，提出减租，以及取消人力車夫繳納互助會的會費。但是，因爲車商的屈服，風潮便算暫告一段落，而人力車夫三日來所受無形損失便只有天曉得了。</p>
<p>跟着又發生的問題，便是限制登記。人力車夫眞是命途多蹇，一波未平，一波又起了。十五日舉行失業車夫登記。因車輛限制，補充已登記的缺額，只有五千名，而失業者達三四萬人。因之發生大騷動，結果搗毀電車汽車十五輛，受傷多人。而被捕車夫梅洪忠等十一名，於二十七日宣判。犯「妨害秩序」罪，判處拘役五十日。這糾紛的原因是限制登記，而失業車夫之所以騷動，也不外由於爲了吃飯，不擇手段。因此，最大的原因還是當局沒有注意到車夫的痛苦。</p>
<p>現在，特區人力車夫協會向黨政機關等需求組織人車夫福利會了。不消說，顧名思義我們也知道這是辦理人力車夫福利事業的機關。並且在二十七日晚刋已看見福利會籌備會議，並且議決下列三項—一，決定會所在南陽橋一帶。二，經費由各區承放人分派負擔。三，本會確事實之需要，應辦理保障車夫工作。並决定先行舉辦「竊車保障，」及「車輛安全保險」兩項。</p>
<p>看了他們的議决案，和先行舉辦的兩項福利事業，我們認爲未能盡這個福利會的責任。我們認爲，舉凡一切福利事業應從最迫切方面下手，而又非深刻了解車夫的痛苦不可。關於車夫的痛苦，除了失業車夫的無法維持生活外，如因車委會與車商傾軋，而至引起類似月初的風潮，致遭受莫大痛苦，和日常所受的非人待遇，以及互助會的徵收會費等等，都是當前急待解決的事情。至於一切保險事業，敎育事業，娛樂事業等，均須以解除目前痛苦以后才談得到。吾則，捨解除目前痛苦而不理，只謀那空洞的不切實的福利事業，又究與車夫本身有什麼福利可說。</p>
<h3 id="c180">巷 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 卓爾</p>
<p>低矮的房屋擠到一塊兒，造成了這麼個小巷，看上去簡直就是一羣衣衫褴褸齷齪而傴僂着身軀的年老的乞丐。蓬鬆着毛亂的頭髮，呈露着多縐的消瘦的面皮，滿身上擺滿了污穢，發散着惡臭，還不時的搖幌着瘡痍佈滿的手臂，像是在向什麽人乞討的一樣……那小巷就每天在陰暗的像沒有陽光的季侯里一樣的蜷伏在黑暗的影子里閃着可憎的眼晴，它們追趕着灰色的命運。</p>
<p>沒有什麽奇怪，在這里像其他地方一樣地有人生活着，不過這里與別處不同的是只住着女人，男人不過是爲了滿足某種慾望而來的罷了。們沒有夫妻，沒有家庭，沒有尊卑之分，她們就是被生活條伴所决定了的操着同一種謀生方式的一羣，她們底生活是一段段地繼續着，在這「一段」的時間里就完成了們底一個交易的單位，昨天是這樣，今天是這樣，明天是這樣，要一直這樣地下去…………。。</p>
<p>低矮的屋子透不進一點兒陽光，（陽光被矗立在前面的高大地圍牆遮沒了。）所以裏面只有糢糊，偈是充滿了黑色的霧，牆壁是潮濕的，在牆根下生滿着鮮苔和菌類，濕的氣味迷漫在空長，侵襲着人的鼻管，使人要感到窒息一樣的不舒服，或者要嘔了出來，但，她們却是處之泰然了！</p>
<p>早上在這裏是代替了夜，在夜間，這裏却成了最活躍的時候，這時候她們底生之脈搏是高速度的躍動着。</p>
<p>「走吧，到巷里去吧！」</p>
<p>勞苦的，單身的漢子們，忙完了他們底一天的工作，懷着個疲憊的心，要向她們去找點慰籍，在迷濛的夜色中，他們在搜尋着適當的伴侶，……</p>
<p>她們站在巷里的黝暗的街燈下，唱着粗曠而單純的戀歌，嗓音是那樣地低啞而帶着破裂的抖動，他們向單身的漢子們賣弄着風情，希望能獲得某個人的惠顧，於是她們更進一步的裝飾着自己，變化着自己，使得自己能與其他人有顯著的不同，而很容易的得到他們注意，她們便互相爭奇鬥艶的在暗中爭鬥着了。</p>
<p>阿根嫂，已經是快四十歲的人了，她在巷里是資格最老的一個，她大槪自十幾歲就來到這里，她在這里渡過了幾十個灰色的年頭，她曉得這是一件不名譽的行業，但等到她想到除此之外便沒有謀生的路子，她又心安了，她反而覺得操這種行業是對的，神聖的，對自己的人格也並沒有减低，於是她巧妙地轉到另一個想頭她輕輕地說了「命運呵……。」</p>
<p>這命運就撥弄着巷里的女人們。</p>
<p>阿根嫂正像共她的年輕姣俏的同伴一樣，把自己打扮得乾净一點，臉上塗上了粉，擦上了胭脂，她竭力的使自己顯得年輕和漂亮一點，好博得年輕漢子們的歡愛，秒舞動着肥臃的身驅向每個漢子追逐着。</p>
<p>「先生，先生，去玩玩吧！愜意的很……」</p>
<p>聲音嘶啞得像隻雄鴨，在綿軟里加雜着哀求的成分，這樣，她環繞在每個漢子的身旁，緊緊地跟着。可是，那些年靑的漢子允使她失望了，他們只上下的打　她一下便縱聲的笑了，他們只調笑着說：「你是不是八十歲了？……你這個老奶奶……」他們拋開她，不再理她，手里挽着年輕的女人，去了！</p>
<p>她麻木地失掉了每個希望，她又很快地追上到巷里來的別個男人：「可隣可憐吧！好心的：」「到我家里去坐一會兒好嗎？先生…」「…便宜得很，先生呵…」</p>
<p>他們的心腸是多麼硬呵！他們很快地離開她底糾纏，她底苦苦地哀告似的話語，只換來了許多輕薄的毀謗！那些年輕的得到客人的同伴們，向客人殷勤的說笑着，她們搖幌着腰肢，在她眼前經過的時候，向她惡意的做着鬼臉，她不敢正眼看她們那些驕傲的樣子，她把頭轉向一邊，牠底心起着陣陣地劇烈的痛楚，像是給誰一刀一刀地割着，割成了碎片……</p>
<p>她眼前的一切給淚珠兒隔得糢糊了。</p>
<p>——「自己是怎樣的不行了！已經沒有能力去和年經的同伴們去競爭了……」她這樣地想着「…自己，自己以前也是那麽年輕的呵！……也是被漢子們歡迎着，可是，現在是完了，也像從前的老女人一樣的被人忘掉了…………</p>
<p>「現在的年輕的女人，也總有老的一天呵……</p>
<p>她自己心里有說不出的難過，同時她也看到了年輕的同伴們將來的命運。</p>
<p>「只要有一天沒有這個巷就好了！</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>…」她低低的吐嚕着。</p>
<p>抬起頭來望望天，黑洞洞地沒有一絲兒光亮，破舊而矮小的屋子在黑暗的天幕的櫬託下，更顯得低縮了，像是要倒塌的一樣。</p>
<p>粗俗的調情的話語，放縱的戲謔的笑聲由每間屋里爬了出來：還有那淺薄的淫蕩的小調兒陣陣地起伏着，騷擾了這巷里的安靜。巷里很少有人走動了阿根嫂知道今天是又沒有了希望，她無目的走動着，</p>
<p>「就讓這些屋子一齊塌下來，把這些人都壓死吧！……」她恨恨地這麼說</p>
<h3 id="c181">「雷雨」觀後 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>中國旅行劇團在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>「雷雨」由復旦劇社演出的時候，我曾經寫過一些觀後感過的。由於劇本結構上的嚴密生動，每個脚色的個性都把握得很緊，加之演出上也很不壞，所以當時曾給予我此讀劇本時還大的感動過；現在，隔了四個月的現在，又有機會看到職業的「中旅」的演出，又使我感動了一次。</p>
<p>「雷雨」的作者曹禺先生在一我如何寫『雷雨』一文中曾經說到他所以有「序幕」和「尾聲」的用意，（現在上演的雖沒有這二塲，但作者的製作態度我們是不難以一斑以窺全豹的。）他說：「簡單地說，是想送看戲的人們回家，帶着一種哀靜的心情，低着頭，沉思地，念着這些在情熱，在夢想，在計算裏，煎熬着的人們。盪漾在他們的心裏應該是水似的悲哀，流不盡的，而不是惶惑的，恐怖的，回念着雷雨像一塲噩夢；死亡，慘痛如一隻鉗子似的夾住的心靈，喘不出一口氣來。總之，是想「導引觀衆的情緒入於更寬闊的沈思的海」。</p>
<p>由於這樣，所以作者就像「臉上刻劃着經歷的縐紋的父老們，在森森的祖父，津津地述說墳頭鬼火，野廟僵屍的故事」同樣，聽的人雖然「皮膚起了恐懼的寒慄，牆角似乎晃着搖搖的鬼影」，而說的可「津津地述說」，好像是「時間上非常遠的處所」</p>
<p>所以，「雷雨」雖然是暴露大家庭的罪惡，」而作者可「並沒有顯明地意識着我（作者，下同此）是要匡正，諷刺或攻擊些什麼。也許寫到末了隱隱彷彿有一種情威的汹湧的流來推動我，我在發洩着被抑壓的憤懣，毀謗着中國的家庭和社會」。</p>
<p>「中旅」在華北排演「雷雨」時，據說曾得作者親身參與，貢獻意見過的，所以如果以忠於原作來說，那大槪可說是「忠實」的；（例如第四幕的結尾，便和原作同樣。）不過，以我個人的愚見，與上决復旦演的對照着來看，我却覺得是復旦那决改動過的來得緊凑，尤其是第四幕的結束，和魯大海的出走，都比這决要有勁得多！</p>
<p>以演出的技巧上說呢，那麼「中旅」這决是比「復旦」更好的，更好的原因，是在於熟練，在於平均。燈光，音嚮效果，舞臺裝置，大體上都到了無可疵議的地步，而演員的演技，也都在水準以上，沒有特殊的使人看不過去的。</p>
<p>演員方面最好的是飾蘩漪的趙慧深，和飾魯貴的姜明，更其是蘩漪這樣難演的脚色，能演到這樣程度，眞是非常難能可貴的；演魯貴的。能演到現在這樣「恰好」，也非常不易；演四鳳的，如果在臺詞上注意些，注意到每句話的情感，不在末二字提得特別高，一定含有更好的成就，演魯大海的體格欠魁梧，發音欠宏壯，頭髮也最好別梳得光光亮亮的：演魯媽的化裝方面欠年老一點，動作和發音上，最好也能再注意到一些；周萍這個脚色是和蘩漪同樣難演的這裏也沒有握住他整個的性格，祇是逐段的隨劇情進展而演戲，雖然在這段中演得不錯，但在整個的印象上，他却無法使人連接起來；演周冲的不僅要使人感到他是痴憨，並且要使人戚到他的純潔無邪和藏在靈魂深處的美滿的理想，現在那位先生却嫌不够些；演周樸園的，在動作上是够了，但在說話方面，最好能不把字音拖得太長。</p>
<p>除此之外，我在上面説過：燈光，音嚮效果，　　裝置，大體上都到了無可疵議的地步的。尤其是第三幕，在那蛙鳴，閃電，雨聲和春調中，使人親切地像處在一個悶熱的夏夜中。</p>
<p>艱苦奮鬥了二年多的「中旅」，在這决成續中說明了他們並沒有把精力白費，這是很可欣喜的，我們祝福着它的成長之外，更希望從風雲日急的華北來的它能够更堅强地，站在劇運的最前綫，而對着現實，　戲劇運動，做一位先鋒</p>
<h3 id="c182">青蛙 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>「池塘生春靑，園柳囀鳴禽」。春天的景象的確是好的。在白天有不少的樂師，歌者，奏着或唱着悅耳的樂曲，但晚上牠們却都停止奏唱了。春天的晚上是寂寞的，活靜的，除了春風徐來，春水漾微波，及樹影的搖擺之外，什麼都是安册的，幽靜的。然而並非絕對如此，那就是靑蛙的歌唱了。</p>
<p>靑蛙，是可愛的小東西，牠披着靑色的衣躱在池的一角，使人不容易看出牠來。牠有圓的突出的眼珠，彷彿一個戴五六百度的近視眼鏡的詩人。牠的勁健的兩腿善於跳躍，當牠站在草叢裏休息的時候，你若給牠一點驚動，牠便敏捷地「閣」的一聲躍入水裏去了，於是你只能看見浪花的飛濺。</p>
<p>靑蛙，在幼時我和牠極熟悉的，我曾用綫覊囚過牠，用槍傷害過牠，但混入都市後和他隔閡得連想起牠的心也沒有了。去年重返鄕間，聽了蟬，聽了絡緯，現在又聽靑蛙的歌唱了。「靑草池塘處處蛙，「的確，在春天，靑蛙是很多很多的。但大多數人都討厭牠，因牠擾亂人家的安眠。又為了牠的肉的鮮美可食，常常要遭到被捉的運命。我愛靑蛙，但也曾吃過靑蛙的肉，那是六七年前的事，我在鄉下的學校裏，該校風景極好，校的四周是一條闊大的池，池中的靑蛙特別多，當我們上完夜課到校園裏去彈唱的時侯，靑蛙便響應我們，「閣閣閣！閱閣閣！」有節奏地使我們戚到莫大的愉快。但在睡覺的時候大家都感到靑蛙的可惟厭了。於是有一天請了五六個漁者捕捉牠們了，除了給漁者拿去外，我們有了一隻不曾有過的好菜，那是一大盆的靑蛙的肉，又鮮又香，滋味的確是道地的。同學們都希望着再能吃到這隻好菜。可是在晚上，當我聽到稀少的蛙聲的時候我悲哀着了，懺悔着了。此後在鄉下，在都市裏，我都有吃靑蛙的機會，可是我始終沒有吃過，雖然我知道靑蛙的滋味是道地的。</p>
<p>現私我又聽着蛙聲了。這一陣懺悔還在襲擊着我。我愛靑蛙，靑蛙是樂觀派的詩人呢。一年四季，秋季是詩人最多的季節，但畢竟太悽愴了。鄭振鐸先生在「蟬與紡織娘」中說：「牠們唱的是秋之歌，是暮年之歌，是薤露之曲，牠們的歌聲是如秋風之掃落葉，怨婦之奏琵琶，孤峭而幽奇，淸遠而凄迷，低回而愁腸百結。」這是形容秋天的詩人的極好的辭句。至春天的詩人靑蛙，那就不然了。牠們的聲音是空曠，高朗。牠們不怨天允人，牠們仰起頭來唱，激昂慷慨。當牠們獨唱的時候，便像一個披髮詩人站立在莽原上唱他的豁達的詩句。當牠們幾隻合唱的時侯，疏疏朗朗地便像粗大的雨點滴落在如傘的荷葉上。當牠們羣唱的時侯，那就更好聽了，像錢塘江上的晚潮，滾滾而來。但無論牠們獨唱，合唱，羣唱，牠們的胸際始終是闊大的，牠們毫沒有凄凄切切的衰頹之音。</p>
<p>「春江水暖鴨先知」。其實，靑蛙的敏感並不减於鴨，當牠們把整個的身子侵在水裹的時侯，牠們實早已知道水暖了。一切的蟲類還沒有歌唱，靑蛙却早在歌唱了，靑蛙是春之贊美者，前驅者呢。</p>
<p>在晚上，當你悠閒地坐在椅上抽姻的時候，當你孤寂地躺在牀上冥想的時候，或者你想寫一篇詩了，或者和你的愛人談倦了，或者耐不住愁苦了，那麼，朋友；我勸你閉起眼睛壓住了心的跳動去聽蛙唱……</p>

After one or two more rounds of negotiations in Tianjin, the talks can conclude. Qin Dechun was summoned by Song via telegram to discuss crucial public matters in person. He will go to Tianjin with Shi Jingting tonight. Sources related to the matter believe that resolving the eastern Hebei and northern Chahar issues will not be without considerable difficulty.

<h3 id="e4">Rose's Visit to Kawagoe Involved Two Matters of Inquiry: Obstacles to Smuggling in North China and the Implementation of Currency Reform <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) External sources report that Li Zi Ross met with Kawagoe on the 28th and raised two matters for inquiry: 1. Smuggling in North China affects British economic interests and causes instability in the Chinese economy. Kawagoe said that the cause of smuggling stems from the excessively high Chinese tariff rates, making it unprofitable to import Japanese goods. Although this is a matter for China as a whole, Chinese merchants have indeed obtained special benefits from Japanese goods. If China corrects the tariffs, it can naturally eliminate smuggling. Li said that he has suggested to the Chinese government to request tax reductions but hopes that the Japanese consul will assist in suppressing smuggling to prevent British merchants' markets from being encroached upon. Kawagoe said that this is a matter for the Chinese government and he has no right to interfere. 2. Li asked about the obstacles to the implementation of unified currency reform in China and what intentions lie behind them. Kawagoe said that he has not heard of such facts as of now. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Zhe visited Sir Li Zi Ross at the British Embassy at 11 a.m. on the 29th, reportedly for a friendly conversation. (29th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese newspapers here today stated that Sir Rose, the head of the British economic advisory mission, met with Japanese Ambassador to Tianjin Kawagoe for two hours to discuss the issue of smuggling in North China. Rose stated that the entry of smuggled goods into North China has greatly affected British interests, so he requested that the Japanese take measures to rectify it. Kawagoe replied that smuggling is caused by excessively high Chinese tariffs and cited the smuggling of goods from Hong Kong to Guangzhou to show that smuggling is not limited to one corner of North China. In his reply, Rose hinted that the Chinese government might accept a request to reduce tax rates. Kawagoe had previously served as the Japanese consul in Guangzhou and therefore knew the smuggling situation in Guangdong province in detail, stating that North China is the same as Guangdong province, and the only preventive measure lies in the Chinese customs authorities taking action themselves; Japan cannot interfere.

<p>(Tianjin) The sales channels for smuggled goods are becoming increasingly congested, with the price of rayon and sugar nearly halved. The total losses of the Japanese ruffians in one week amounted to 100,000 yuan. They are now urgently seeking to open up smuggling routes to the Northwest. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The prices of smuggled sugar and rayon have plummeted in recent days. Tianqiao brand rayon is priced at 87 yuan per piece, Tiantan brand at 92 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at only 80 yuan. Sugar sells for 16.5 yuan per bag. The inventory in a certain concession in Tianjin is increasing daily, and the Japanese ruffians are all complaining. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The serious situation of tax evasion and smuggling in North China was discussed in the House of Commons today. Conservative Party member Chilton asked Foreign Secretary Eden whether he had asked the Japanese government to pay attention to the serious consequences of the large-scale smuggling of Japanese goods into North China through eastern Hebei. What steps will Britain take to secure British loans secured by tariffs? Eden replied that the British government has been paying attention to the serious development of smuggling in North China for some time and has made representations to the Chinese and Japanese governments separately. The British government is now actively considering ways to protect British trade and the security of foreign debts in North China, given the deterioration of the situation and the reduction of tariffs on goods entering North China through demilitarized zones. As for how much China's tariff revenue has been lost, he has not received official news, but the British Embassy in China is expected to send a detailed report to Britain. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Li Dijun, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Management Department, met with Chinese and foreign journalists on the 29th and made a statement, saying that in recent months, newspapers in Japan and in China have repeatedly published news of China and the Soviet Union signing secret treaties, even fabricating the clauses of the so-called secret treaties as if they were real. Such unfounded rumors have been repeatedly published by the country's newspapers, which cannot but make one suspect that there is another purpose. The duty of newspapers is to report accurately and comment fairly. In this way, they can lead public opinion internally and promote international understanding externally. There is no shortage of enlightened people in the Japanese press. As Sino-Japanese relations begin to be adjusted, it is hoped that they will contribute more to the relationship based on facts. If they are keen to stimulate readers by fabricating facts, it will not only damage the value of their opinions but also easily cause international misunderstandings, which is regrettable.

<h3 id="e14">The Dim Prospect of International Aid to Albania <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Since Italy's war against Albania began on September 25th of last year, eight months have passed in an instant. During this period, the Albanian people relied solely on their flesh and blood and patriotic fervor to resist the Italian army's planes and cannons. Their armaments were vastly different from those of the Italian army, so the outcome was determined before the war even began. The questions were when Albania would surrender and whether the international community could provide Albania with effective assistance in time. Recently, the Albanian army on the northern front repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with the Italian army, which had dense formations and fully mechanized equipment. The resulting heavy casualties accelerated the collapse of the Albanian army. Although the remnants of the Albanian army are still勉力 guarding the highway from Taixi to the Albanian capital, it is doubtful whether they can withstand the Italian army's advance before the rainy season. If the international community cannot immediately put strong pressure on Italy, the fall of the Albanian capital seems to be only a matter of time. However, judging from the current situation, international aid is even more渺茫 than before.</p>
<p>Among the major powers today, the one that relatively has a need to aid Albania is Britain, whose imperial communication lines are threatened by Italy. However, due to complex relationships and excessive considerations, unless it unites with other countries to jointly cope, it lacks the courage to single-handedly undertake the arduous task of suppressing the strong and supporting the weak. British General Robinson stated in his recently published book "On Security" that "There are at least three reasons why my country cannot seek peace: my country possesses great wealth. War only brings losses and no gains; my country's territories are all over the globe, and any area, whether in the air or at sea, is extremely vulnerable to attack, making defense particularly difficult; even if a war breaks out and Britain does not participate, it will at least lose most of its markets and suffer the after-effects of economic collapse." Therefore, Britain can only maintain its prosperity and reap its benefits if the international community is at peace. War is only harmful and not beneficial to Britain. Robinson's remarks can be said to have revealed the British mentality. The reason why Britain supports the League of Nations' collective security policy is also derived from this kind of苟安心理, and the fact that it does not dare to act with independent strength to deal with aggressor nations is also a manifestation of this kind of苟安心理. Last year's Hoare-Laval Pact was indeed an attempt to sacrifice Albania to appease Italy. Although Eden, after taking office, outwardly spoke with strict justice and denounced Italy's aggression, in substance, he did not differ from the Hoare era at all. The reason for this is nothing more than a lack of courageous and enterprising spirit of adventure. At the beginning of last month, Germany suddenly marched into the Rhineland with雷霆手段, and the situation in Europe became increasingly complex, and the possibility of realizing new sanctions against Italy became increasingly impossible. It is even more difficult to expect Britain to provide effective aid to Albania in this situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if Britain wants to制意, it must at least obtain France's cooperation. To obtain France's cooperation, it must accept France's views on Germany. However, this will promote the unification of Germany and Italy and make the制意 work even more difficult. This kind of British concern became more and more obvious recently when Germany marched into the Rhineland. France, seeing the ambiguity of Britain's attitude towards Germany, also萌its old habits, showing goodwill to Italy, and causing the Anglo-French cooperation that had just begun to show signs of a turning point. Therefore, unless Britain and France can reach an early compromise on the German issue, Mussolini's military campaign to conquer Albania can be carried out放手直至 Albania's complete surrender. Conversely, even if Britain and France can cooperate effectively on various issues today, it is doubtful whether they can make Italy obey. After Anglo-French cooperation, they have to deal with not only Italy but also Germany. If Germany also emulates what Italy has done, a world war could break out, which Britain is deeply concerned about. Therefore, even if Britain and France can cooperate completely, they do not dare to be too tough on Italy. This can also be inferred.</p>
<p>Now that Albania's resistance to the powerful enemy has reached the point of exhaustion, the international aid is becoming more and more渺茫. How can we expect the League of Nations' institutions not to be damaged and the arrogance of aggressor nations not to be raised?</p>

<h3 id="e18">Prince Teh in Ujumqin Convenes a League and Banner Meeting, Rumors Spread of Establishing an Autonomous Government, Ao Yunzhang Sends a Telegram to Inquire <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, rumors have circulated about Mongolia forming an autonomous government, and some say that the highest Mongolian political organ is moving to Silingol League in Chahar Province. Upon inquiring with Mongolian personnel stationed in Beiping, they strongly denied it. Bao Yueqing, the director of the Mongolian office in Beiping, entered the hospital yesterday due to quitting smoking. According to Ao Yunzhang, the acting secretary-general of the Mongolian Political Council, he had not heard anything about the Mongolian Political Council reorganizing into a government, stating that it was just a rumor. He has been away from the council for a month and is not very clear about the affairs within the council. He has now urgently sent a telegram to Prince Teh to inquire about the truth, and a reply is expected tonight. It is also reported that Prince Teh is currently in Ujumqin, convening a meeting of the league and banner chiefs. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, this source received reliable news from the Chinese side that Prince Teh will organize an independent government in Pangjiang, and the list of candidates has been prepared and will be formally announced in the coming days. Prince Teh will serve as the chairman. Among the other important positions, only the Minister of Justice will be held by a Mongolian. As for the various departments such as the Army, Finance, Education, and Transportation, they will all be controlled by the Japanese. This news has not yet been directly confirmed, but the representative of Prince Teh here became ill and entered the hospital immediately after denying the above news, which is indeed a strange matter. It is known that recently the Japanese have put pressure on Prince Teh to break away from Nanjing. Therefore, people here firmly believe that Prince Teh will be forced to declare independence. As for the territory of Inner Mongolia after independence, it cannot be determined at present. Recently, Nanjing has taken measures to prevent the Mongols from defecting. Taking the establishment of the Suiyuan Mongolian Association as an example, although Prince Teh's headquarters are located in Bailingmiao in Suiyuan, the Suiyuan Mongolian Association actually limits Prince Teh's power to the Mongolian affairs of Chahar Province only. The Suiyuan Mongolian Association is directly responsible to Nanjing. The Japanese military authorities are currently very active in Inner Mongolia and have established a military school in Zhangbei, recruiting 500 Mongolian youths between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five, and providing them with military training. It is said that Mongolian officials are forced to send their children to school, resulting in a shortage of manpower to take care of the Inner Mongolian pastures. The Mongols have no choice but to recall their children who have been sent to Lama temples to raise livestock. There are many Japanese living in Prince Teh's mansion near Pangjiang, and hundreds of Mongolian soldiers under Li Shouxin are also stationed in Bailingmiao. The Japanese are making every effort to have Mongolian foreign trade pass through Dolon, instead of going south to mainland China. Tax checkpoints have been set up in places like Zhangbei, controlled by the Japanese, to control everything. Exports from Inner Mongolia, such as wool, hides, and horses, are tax-free if they pass through Dolon, but heavy taxes must be paid if they pass through Zhangjiakou, sometimes up to 100%. Japanese merchants are now importing American freight vehicles from Dalian into Inner Mongolia, and their selling price is 450 yuan cheaper than those transported to Inner Mongolia via the Ping-Sui Railway.

<h3 id="e19">Jiang Tingfu Discusses Reforming Local Administration: Sound Organization Utilizes Talent to Its Fullest <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan has recently been paying close attention to the investigation of the work of its subordinate agencies, the evaluation of job responsibilities, the adjustment of functions, and the general reform of local administration. A reporter recently visited Jiang Tingfu to inquire about the central government's strategy for reforming local administration. According to his statement, sound administration is nothing more than: compact organization, flexible operation, appropriate powers, suitable talent, talent utilized to its fullest, and sufficient funding, rationally allocated. China's local governments are far from sound in these three aspects. He believes that there are several points that should be improved: In recent years, the central government and the Provisional Headquarters have implemented many new measures, such as joint offices, the establishment of commissioners, and the transformation of county government bureaus into sections, which have been vigorously promoted. However, there are still many problems to be solved, and President Jiang is paying close attention. At present, county governments lack sufficient funds for administration, and there is no talk of funding for undertakings. However, the county governments are required to carry out more and more undertakings, leading them to regard county administration as a daunting task and gather in senior agencies to engage in the transfer of official documents, making administration increasingly hollow. The functions and powers of administrative commissioners should not be limited to liaison between superiors and subordinates, and should be clearly defined and analyzed. Local security is the foundation of all kinds of construction. Those who maintain public order in various places include the police, defense corps, troops, and baojia, etc., which cost the people a great deal of money, but the results are very low. The reason why the people become bandits is mostly because they are forced by livelihood and take risks. In short, to make reforms effective, one must recognize the problem itself and prescribe the right medicine, so as to avoid changing orders in the morning and evening, and making things more complicated. The purpose of the Executive Yuan convening a meeting of commissioners is to listen to opinions and solicit expert advice, and personnel will be sent to inspect after the meeting to understand the crux of each problem, in order to obtain a simple and easy-to-implement improvement strategy.

<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke previously planned to comprehensively coordinate the revitalization of the rural economy with the strength of the government based on cooperative principles, and ordered Liang Han Cao and more than ten legislators to study concrete implementation measures. Liang and others decided after consultation to study in three steps: Establishing a cooperative system; Investigating and connecting existing cooperative businesses in all areas; Raising funds to increase the floating capital of farmers, and also promoted Lou Tongsun and Yao Chuanfa to study the first step, and Chen Changheng and Wei Tingsheng to study the second and third steps. Now the first step has been completed, and on the afternoon of the 29th, a meeting was held inviting Liang Han Cao, Ma Yinchu, and others, and the method of organizing or systematizing cooperative businesses was passed. The rest regarding the implementation procedure will be decided in a follow-up discussion. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Ma Yinchu Discusses Opinions on Reviving the Countryside: Future Rural Loans Should Be Unified, and Bank Interest Rate Reductions Should Be Carefully Considered <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu, the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan, shared his views on the plan to revive the countryside, as well as the influence of Li Ziluosi's recent speech, and also discussed the issue of bank interest rate reductions. Ma said that well-known figures in the domestic economic circles currently have differing opinions on the economic decline of society in recent years. Some advocate reviving the countryside, while others advocate revitalizing industry, each with their own reasons. He believes that without reviving agriculture, the economy of farmers will not recover, and the purchasing power of the majority of the population, the farmers, will still not be able to increase. Therefore, reviving agriculture should be the priority, but revitalizing industry should not be neglected either. This is a matter of sequence, and there is no difference in importance. At present, the best cooperative societies in the country are those organized by the China International Famine Relief Commission, Zhang Yuanshan, and others. Their organization is from the bottom up, ensuring that the organization is sound and the members are pure. Although there are many cooperative societies in other places, they are not very sound. It is necessary to train and guide talent, detach from urban life, and personally go to the countryside to make farmers understand the benefits of cooperation, and to increase the cost and benefits of individual production, then it can be promoted unimpeded. As for the current separate investments of various banks in rural areas, much of it is actually lost. This type of cooperative society aims to provide loans, and the investments of various banks are not the same. As a result, a cooperative society can obtain loans from several banks. Therefore, the use of loans, whether they are for agricultural affairs, cannot be proven. Ultimately, the loans cannot be repaid, affecting the credit of the cooperative society. In the future, it is necessary to unify rural loans. As for income tax and inheritance tax, they are good taxes. The current tax rates in our country are all levied on ordinary people, and consumption tax is also a transfer tax, which is borne by users, regardless of rich or poor. Only those who own assets and deposit money in banks are not taxed, which is very unfair. Therefore, income tax and inheritance tax are taxes levied on the rich. As for the legislator Xiao Shuyu's proposal to monopolize salt, once this tax rate is implemented, the livelihood of ordinary people will be further increased. I personally do not want to agree. Furthermore, Sir Li Ziluosi's recent opinions in Shanghai on Chinese finance are helpful as suggestions from others. However, regarding the section on inflation mentioned by Luo, there is no such fact in China's current finances. Ma also said that the general public advocates that banks reduce loan interest rates, and the central bank should consider ways to deal with the economic situation on the market. However, the reduction of bank loan interest rates also means the simultaneous reduction of interest rates on deposits. Currently, foreign banks in China are raising deposit interest rates to 6% or 7%. If domestic banks reduce deposit interest rates, there is a risk that capital will flow into foreign banks. This should be carefully considered. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Qian Chengxu is scheduled to go to Wu on the 30th and then to Anqing. According to him, regarding the dispute between Anhui Province and the tea merchants, he met with Lei Juechang yesterday and provided a compromise method: tea merchants in Shanghai will organize a company specializing in export trade. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce quite agrees. In addition to the ministry sending a telegram to Anhui to solicit opinions, he will also report the process to Shanghai. As for the outcome, it will only become clear after meeting with Chairman Liu and Directors Liu and Yang in Anhui. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The control of tea planting by the governments of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces has led to the closure of Shanghai tea warehouses. The Anhui Provincial Government has telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting that tea merchants be persuaded. It is said that domestically produced black tea originally occupied an important position in international trade, but it has declined to the extreme in recent years. If no measures are taken to revive it, tea farmers and tea merchants will inevitably perish together. Shanghai warehouse tea merchants are manipulating and controlling, and are even threatening to stop exchanging remittances, which is truly ignorant of the overall situation. Please persuade them, etc. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

It will be established in early May. Long-distance telephone communication between Hebei and Chahar provinces is designated as: 1. Pingzhang, 2. Zhangbao, 3. Jinzhang. All three lines are centered on Zhangyuan. The first two lines have been opened, and the latter line will be connected via Ping, with calls to be made on May 10. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has decided on four measures for the export of Lu salt to Japan: Lu salt exported to Japan must be surplus production. If it is not sufficient for transportation and sales, then foreign exports will be stopped. The tax rate for exports to Japan must not be lower than that of Qing salt, with a principle of taxing six points per dan. Lu salt exported to Japan should meet the needs of Japanese industry and must not be used as edible salt. This layer requires the guarantee of the Japanese government. After Lu salt is exported, the Japanese side must not import it back (because the people of our country must bear national tax and local surcharges for edible salt, totaling eight yuan per dan. Prevent the Japanese side from re-importing it after exporting it, which is called inverting). These measures stipulate that the four places of Changlu, Lianghuai, Shandong, and Fujian can all be applied. On the surface, the tax rate required by the government is reduced, but the exports can replenish the revenue and at the same time increase sales and reduce smuggling. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council Organization Committee continued to discuss China's request for a semi-permanent council seat tonight. After three hours of debate, it passed the report drafted by Lord Cecil and adjourned. The committee unanimously approved China's return to the Administrative Council. However, regarding the term issue, it was believed that if the term was set at one year, there would still be the right to be re-elected after the one-year term expired, without the usual restriction on consecutive re-election.

(28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council Councillor Quota Allocation Committee decided yesterday to submit recommendations to the Administrative Council and the League of Nations General Assembly, advocating that a temporary council seat should be added for China. Well-informed sources believe that the Administrative Council and the General Assembly will definitely pass it when they discuss this case in the future. It is understood that the committee has been meeting since the 27th of this month to discuss two principled issues: Should the Administrative Council add a council seat, and how long should the term of the newly added council seat be? Regarding the first issue, although the representatives of Sweden and Canada expressed dissent, the committee still decided to add a seat and give it to China. Since Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, there has been no Asian representative in the Administrative Council. Now that the Chinese government has made a request, it should naturally be given to that country. As for the temporary council seat added in 1933, which was given to Portugal, it should still be maintained. Then the issue of the term of the newly added councillor was discussed. The representatives of France, Spain, Argentina, Romania, and Italy all proposed a term of one year. The British representative, Lord Cecil, advocated that the usual term of three years for semi-permanent councillors of the Administrative Council should be followed. At that time, the voting result was that nine countries supported the British proposal. In addition, the representatives of Poland and Canada both waived their voting rights. Once the three-year term of the councillor added in 1933, that is, the seat given to Portugal, expires, it should still be given to European member states. It is expected that there will be many contenders for this seat, including Latvia, Austria, and Portugal, who are expected to make demands. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Changchun) Wang Delin (that is, the one called Desheng, who is different from General Wang Delin), a famous volunteer army leader in the Northeast, and four of his important comrades were recently arrested by the Japanese for plotting to burn down a Japanese airfield. After suffering inhumane torture, the case has been closed and they will soon become national heroes. Previously, Wang planned to take major actions, so he divided his troops into smaller units and scattered them in various designated areas, waiting for an opportunity to launch. He personally led several important cadres to sneak into the city of Shenyang. Wang disguised himself as a small businessman selling coal, Fang Xiufeng (that is, Xinlaihao) and Zhang Dongge (that is, Nanxia) disguised themselves as oil paint workers and mixed into the Shenyang Japanese airfield, while Jin Wenkui (that is, Beixia) was responsible for reconnaissance and communication, and they proceeded separately. However, Jin was recognized and arrested by the Japanese at the station when he went to Anshan at the end of March. As a result of severe torture, he confessed the residences of his comrades due to mental confusion, and Wang, Zhang, and Fang were also arrested successively. Later, Zhang Wenji was arrested at his residence in Laohutun, the eighth district of Haicheng County. Zhang is the brother of the volunteer army leader "Green Forest Hao" and also the arms custodian of Wang's troops. Therefore, when Zhang was arrested, a large number of long and short guns and ammunition were searched and taken away. (29th Hualian Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) British political figures who recently returned from Austria made pessimistic predictions about the future of Austria, saying that German Chancellor Hitler may realize the plan to merge Germany and Austria without waiting for the end of the Italian-Abyssinian War, so as to take advantage of the Italian army's inability to take care of the "Brenner" Pass (at the border between Italy and Austria), and put it before Italian Prime Minister Mussolini as an accomplished fact. All well-informed sources said that if the merger of Germany and Austria is realized at this time, the danger it may cause is much greater than in the past. As far as our reporter knows, the British government is well aware that the merger of Germany and Austria will inevitably cause great danger to Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula. Therefore, it has almost stopped opposing Austria's restoration of the conscription system, and at least does not intend to make a clear protest to Austria at present. Responsible people also said that if Britain has any dealings with Austria, it should be carried out when the conscription system is implemented. This attitude has been internally determined, and if the French government comes to inquire, it should be answered in this way. (28th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) London reported last night that German Chancellor Hitler may realize the plan to merge Germany and Austria without waiting for the end of the Italian-Abyssinian War. Regarding this matter, Mrs. Tabuyi, a diplomatic reporter for the Business Newspaper, recently declared, "According to well-informed sources in Paris and London, once an event occurs in Austria (the big city is Linz), the German government will immediately block the border and prohibit people from traveling between Germany and Austria, and at the same time notify the foreign affairs authorities of various countries of this decision, so as to cover the eyes and ears of the world and shirk the responsibility for the Austrian event in law. If this is the case, then Germany's intervention in Austria cannot be proven, and the future events in Austria can only be regarded as internal affairs, and the League of Nations covenant will naturally not be applicable. Even if Britain and France want to come out and intervene, they will feel extremely difficult." (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Britain Will Raise a Question Form Asking Germany to Clarify Its Attitude</p>
<p>(London) The question form that the British government will submit to Germany regarding the German memorandum of March 31 has recently been sorted out by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will be submitted to Foreign Secretary Eden for review this afternoon, and then submitted to the Cabinet for discussion tomorrow before being issued. As far as the general public knows, there have been many rumors about Austria recently, mostly expressing pessimism. Therefore, the British government should pay special attention to the Austrian issue in the question form. On the contrary, the relationship between Russia and Germany will not be mentioned directly, because the German return to the League of Nations and the proposal to fully fulfill the obligations of the League of Nations covenant are sufficient guarantees for the security of the Soviet Union. Even British officials said that the security issue of the Soviet Union should be regarded as the same as the security of other member states of the League of Nations and should not be treated differently. If it is specially mentioned, it may stimulate Germany's resentment and not help the matter. (28th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rumors in London That the Relationship Between Italy and Yugoslavia Is Deteriorating</p>
<p>(London) It is widely rumored that Yugoslavia may maintain neutrality in this matter, but if Italy intervenes to stop the realization of the merger of Germany and Austria, the Yugoslav army will be prepared to enter the Austrian province of Carinthia to stop the Italian army's actions. Germany will give Carinthia to Yugoslavia after the matter is completed as a reward. However, this statement has not been confirmed. According to another rumor, the relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia has deteriorated sharply recently. The reason is that Italy sent 50,000 to 60,000 young people to Albania to work in the country's agricultural agencies and incorporate them into the militia, and Italian officers served as instructors. This move is clearly a threat to Yugoslavia. Therefore, when the Balkan Entente countries meet in the capital of Yugoslavia at the beginning of next month, the country intends to submit this matter for discussion. (28th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Vienna) Austria is currently preparing to transfer troops from Vienna and the eastern part of Austria to the west. Nine trains of military vehicles have already departed from Styria for Salzburg. The military is currently keeping it secret, but official circles say that the troop movements are purely for training purposes, with troops stationed on the plains now being transferred to mountainous areas, and those stationed in mountainous areas being transferred to the plains. However, rumors are rife that Germany is making large-scale military preparations along the Bavarian border with Austria. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German officials today dismissed as baseless the claim that Germany is making military preparations on the Austrian border. According to news from Munich, most of the troops in Bavaria have been transferred to the Rhine, so the number of troops in the area is now less than before. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(London) It was widely rumored in political circles last night that Germany might instigate a coup in Austria. This morning, newspapers also acknowledged that this was possible, and said that the Austrian independence issue would be raised for discussion at the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on the 11th of next month. The Morning Post said, "It is rumored that a rift has developed between Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg. The news of this has caused us to feel concern again about the Austrian situation. People in London and Paris are now worried that the National Socialist Party will soon stage another uprising in Austria. If this worry becomes a reality, then Britain will have to come forward to help maintain Austria's independence. In general, although the Austrian problem is not on the agenda of the Executive Council, it will definitely be raised for discussion when the Executive Council meets next month. At that time, France may ask Britain what action the British government intends to take if the current Austrian situation is threatened. How the British government will respond is not yet known, but it will be enough to influence France's future foreign policy, and it is inevitable that the country will tend towards both the Italo-Ethiopian War and the sanctions policy." The Manchester Guardian said, "The rumor that Germany will take action in Austria is rampant. Italy is largely responsible for guaranteeing Austria's independence. Therefore, it is not impossible that Germany will take advantage of Italy's current war in East Africa and its conflict with the League of Nations to take action." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Goering Appointed Economic Dictator; Reflection of Germany's Intense War Preparations; Schacht's Political Position Weakened <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Moscow news reports today commented on the new appointment of German Air Minister Goering to supervise raw materials and foreign exchange problems, saying that the entire economy of German fascists will henceforth be dedicated to the organization and increase of armaments. Since Goering is Hitler's representative, he can place the entire economy of the Third Reich in a subordinate position. He can also expand the war industry, even if it leads to economic collapse. In short, Goering's appointment as economic dictator is nothing less than a major warning to countries that maintain peace. At the same time, it can also show the German Fascist Party's fervor for war preparation and its ambition for aggression. (TASS dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The government issued an order yesterday granting Air Minister General Goering broad powers, entrusting him with all matters relating to raw materials and foreign currency, making him in practice the "supreme dictator" of the German economy. After the issuance of this order, various industrial stocks fell on exchanges across the country. It is generally believed that the position of Economics Minister Dr. Schacht is obviously affected. Although the government gazette stated that Goering's new position was to enhance Schacht's political position, economic circles did not dare to believe it, and believed that Schacht had delivered a speech in Königsberg on August 18 last year, expressing his opposition to the National Socialist Party's anti-Jewish movement. Since then, the radical elements of the National Socialist Party have attacked Schacht, leading to a fierce storm. Until recently, the mutual attacks have reached their peak. The government's granting of broad powers to General Goering is actually a natural result. Schacht was originally not a member of the National Socialist Party, but he was rich in experience in financial and economic matters. The National Socialist Party government relied on Schacht's assistance in increasing economic activity, building automobile roads, organizing public works, and reforming armaments. Therefore, it borrowed his talent, but the radical elements in the party have always criticized Schacht for his liberalism and attacked him at every turn. For example, Kepler, Hitler's confidant and party spokesman, had demanded his dismissal three months ago because Schacht's views on various major issues (such as the anti-Jewish movement and the policy of economic self-sufficiency) differed from those of the party. In addition, Minister of Agriculture Dahl was also incompatible with Schacht. Schacht urgently wanted to restore Germany's foreign trade, while Dahl advocated a policy of economic self-sufficiency so that Germany's food supply would no longer depend on foreign countries. The situation of conflict between the two parties can be seen in Schacht's letter to Dahl at the time (Dahl insisted that Germany must be self-sufficient in meat and fats, and Schacht replied with a letter, which was recently leaked by well-informed sources). The content roughly stated, "I am not a magician and cannot turn stone into gold. At this time, the most important issue in German agriculture is to restore agricultural output based on the figures for 1933." Recently, the National Socialist Party's opposition to Schacht has suddenly intensified due to the increasingly exhausted sources of raw materials and foreign exchange in Germany. For example, a large textile factory in Leipzig issued its annual report yesterday, which stated that the sources of supply for wool, iron ore, coal oil, tungsten, manganese, leather, etc., may be exhausted next year. The importance of the raw material problem can be seen from this. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji hosted a banquet tonight for Chen Guangfu and his delegation of the Bank of China, indicating that the talks between Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and the delegation are not far from their conclusion.

Both China and the United States do not want to make any statements about the progress of the negotiations, but it is heard that railway issues and the Export-Import Bank are under discussion, but no concrete steps have been taken yet.

<p>(Gorahai) 5,000 Ethiopian soldiers launched a sudden counterattack last night, exerting significant pressure on the camps and headquarters of the Italian Blackshirts here, causing many visitors to experience the flavor of war. The situation was very dangerous at one point, as Ethiopian soldiers fired artillery shells at the Italian camp, setting fire to the bushes. The gasoline used by the Italian army's motor transport team was stored in the bushes. Reuters special correspondent Captain Barnes was writing a telegram in a heavy truck when bullets rained down. Two people in the vehicle were killed and six were injured. Everyone in the camp was ordered to defend themselves. Fortunately, a large unit of soldiers from Somaliland bravely resisted the repeated attacks, followed by bayonets and hand grenades, directly attacking forward, and finally driving the enemy across the Fa Fang River. Ethiopian soldiers abandoned 600 bodies on the battlefield. When these people were strafed by machine guns, many people were still fighting frantically in the chaos. Ten Italian officers were killed and twenty-three were injured. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Army Commander General Graziani on the Southern Ethiopian Front, due to heavy rains on the front line and his troops' exhaustion from three days of fierce fighting, has ordered a temporary halt to the offensive. Heavy rain is pouring down on the entire front line, and roads have been flooded. Engineers are currently building bridges day and night at the confluence of the Fa Fang River and the Chia Riel River. A 120-foot-long bridge was built over the Fa Fang River in two hours today. The Italian army is currently encountering strong enemies, and their bravery is truly unexpected. Therefore, the plan to capture Sassabane has not yet matured. According to news from Dire Dawa, the Sassabane battle, which began three days ago, is still in full swing. Ethiopian soldiers are fighting to the death, repeatedly defeating the attacking Italian army. The Italian army is currently transferring reinforcements from all sides to fight. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to a telegram from the East African General Headquarters today, on the southern front, due to heavy rain, Ogaden has become a large swamp, and the Italian army's motorized units are useless, so progress has been temporarily halted.

Twenty-one white officers were killed and eighteen were injured. Twenty-seven white soldiers were killed and forty-seven were injured. 1,367 enlisted soldiers were killed. At the same time, thirteen Italian army planes were hit by Ethiopian army anti-aircraft guns, and five pilots were injured.

<p>(Cairo) After the death of King Fuad I, the cabinet held a meeting yesterday to announce that Crown Prince Farouk would succeed to the throne, and issued a bulletin stating that the current King Farouk is scheduled to depart from London on a British mail ship at 1:50 pm on Thursday (30th), and will pass through the port of Marseille, France on May 1st, and arrive in Egypt on May 5th. The cabinet meeting also decided to hold the House of Representatives election on May 11th, because when the Crown Prince accedes to the throne at a young age, a regency council must be formed within ten days of the death of the late monarch to attend the House of Representatives. The regency council will be composed of three regents, appointed by the late monarch in his will before his death, which is sealed and will be opened only when the House of Representatives is convened. In addition, the issue of reconvening the Senate is the key to the political situation, because when the 1923 constitution was abolished in 1930, the Senate was also dissolved. Now that the constitution has been restored, the Senate should also be reconvened to meet, which is the correct way to handle it. However, according to this newspaper's reporter, although the Kuomintang's view is as such, there are practical difficulties and it may not be possible to do so. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Cairo) Egyptian Crown Prince Farouk will ascend the throne when he arrives in Cairo from England on May 5th, but because he is still a minor, the regency council will act as his agent in political affairs. The Crown Prince stayed in England for six months and is scheduled to leave London tomorrow for Marseille, taking the British Company's mail ship Indupugna home. The ship will specially dock temporarily in the port of Alexandria to allow the Crown Prince to disembark. The British Emperor personally offered condolences to the Crown Prince yesterday and ordered mourning for King Fuad for seven days from today. The Egyptian general election will still be held on May 2nd and will not be postponed due to the king's death. The cabinet has not yet decided who will act as the monarch's agent. According to Egyptian customs, women are not allowed to govern, so the Crown Prince's four sisters have no hope. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Cairo) One of the main reasons for King Fuad's death was a bullet he suffered 30 years ago. The king was not yet on the throne at the time. One day, while sitting with politicians and diplomats playing chess in a large club in Cairo, his brother-in-law, Prince Saif al-Din, suddenly arrived and shot him, the bullet piercing his throat. Although he recovered after treatment, he often suffered from choking coughs, so when this disease broke out, he first suffered from blood disease. In addition, the king had been suffering from heart failure for nearly 20 months, which led to his death. When the king was critically ill, seven doctors injected antiseptic fluid into him from time to time, causing him great pain. The king then said to the doctors, "Why don't you let me die peacefully and avoid the pain?" (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Egyptian Crown Prince Farouk was born in Cairo on February 11, 1920. His father Fuad attached great importance to his education, hoping that he would become a useful person. He once said to others, "What is the value of being a Crown Prince? Only a useful person has value." Therefore, all of Farouk's toys when he was young were of an educational nature. When he grew up, he liked to read, collect stamps, take photographs, and was fond of sports. He was fluent in English and French. At the age of 15, he went to England to study, preparing to enter the Royal Military College of England in two years. His height was above average, his appearance was upright, and he was proficient in etiquette. When he took a warship from Alexandria to Port Said, the crew saw him waving a white towel to signal to the shore. The crew was surprised and asked why he was waving the towel since he was far away from the palace and people could not see him. Farouk replied that before he left, he had placed a telescope in the palace and he thought his sisters were holding telescopes to watch him from afar, so he waved the towel to say goodbye to them. After arriving in England, he hired teachers to study various subjects, preparing to enter military college at the age of 17. In 1933, he was named Prince of Upper Egypt. He participated in domestic celebrations on behalf of his father and also served as the head of the Egyptian Boy Scouts that year. He was quick-witted and well-informed about world affairs.

<p>Hebei-Chahar Authorities Discuss Anti-Communist Agreement with Japanese</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, the situation in North China has been under constant pressure from the Japanese. However, diplomatic negotiations have not ceased. Song Zheyuan, who bears the heavy responsibility of managing the situation, has repeatedly stated to the people of North China that, while striving for good neighborly relations, he does not want to lose sovereignty and dignity. However, the Japanese view of North China is to establish a special regime detached from the central government, leaning towards so-called genuine cooperation among China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." Therefore, their diplomatic tone inevitably clashes with our desire to maintain sovereignty and dignity. The major issues in North China's diplomacy are the Hebei-East problem and the Chahar-North problem. Intermittent negotiations have been ongoing for half a year. At the beginning of the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, Xiao Zhenying repeatedly negotiated with Doihara Kenji of the other side in Pingjin, but ultimately failed to reach an agreement. After Doihara Kenji returned to Japan, the negotiating party changed to the Japanese garrison authorities in Tianjin. Although it was relatively smooth for a time, the February 26th Tokyo Incident occurred. Nagami Toshitoku, the chief of staff of the Japanese army in Tianjin, returned to Japan for instructions but received no results. As the anti-communist problem in North China became pressing, Sino-Japanese diplomacy in North China inevitably became tense again. As a result, the negotiations between Xiao Zhenying and the Japanese side became active again. Nagami Toshitoku twice returned to Japan for instructions. After returning to Tianjin, he met with Xiao Zhenying twice on the 20th of this month. There were various rumors from the outside world, saying that the negotiations had resulted in all concrete decisions. In reality, the problem is not as easy to solve as rumored.</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan believed that the anti-communist agreement concerned the national system and did not dare to act arbitrarily. He telegraphed the Japanese demands to the central government for instructions on how to handle them. In recent days, private negotiations between Xiao Zhenying and Nagami and others have reportedly become closer. On May 1st, both China and Japan will officially begin negotiations in Tianjin. Song Zheyuan must wait until the diplomatic problems have made some progress before he can return to Beiping and has stated that once the diplomatic problems are resolved, he will announce the situation to the world to dispel suspicion. However, general observations suggest that the diplomatic situation in North China is too complex, and it is feared that it will be difficult to reach a resolution in the short term. (28th)</p>
<p>Communist Bandit Forces in Northern Shaanxi are Weakening</p>
<p>Only a Few Remnants Remain</p>
<p>Russian Litov Remains to Oversee</p>
<p>Hope is Lost After the Death of Bandit Du</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: After the Communist bandits decided to cross the Yellow River from northern Shaanxi to disturb Shanxi, they were severely suppressed by the National Army. The bandits disintegrated and fled in two directions, north and south. This has been going on for two months. Moreover, the Shanxi-Suiyuan Army, the Central Army, and the Shaanxi-Henan armies are defending in separate areas and attacking from the north and south, and the bandit forces are weakening. According to recent intelligence reports, the bandits, in their desperate state, are planning to return to Shaanxi. Therefore, recently, the remnants of all routes have been concentrated in the Zhongshi area of western Shanxi. However, the Shaanxi army has deployed defenses along the river to prevent the bandits from returning. It is thought that the bandits will not easily return. After the Communist bandits entered Shanxi, the bandit forces in northern Shaanxi are not as strong as before. Mao Jizhai, the political commissioner of Yulin, Shaanxi, has come to Taiyuan to visit Yan and personally report on the recent situation in northern Shaanxi, so that the National Army can accurately assess the bandits. The main points of Mao's report are as follows:</p>
<p>North of Jia County and east of Yulin, there are only the bandit forces of Wang Zhaoxiang and the remnants of Liu Zidan's troops in Shaanxi, only about six or seven hundred men.</p>
<p>In Sanbian, there are Liu Jinfan's (Liu Zidan's younger brother) bandit troops, 500 infantry bandits, and 300 cavalry bandits.</p>
<p>In Hengshan, there are 500 to 600 bandits from Niu Gang.</p>
<p>North of Wubao, there is Liu Zidan's newly formed battalion of 500 to 600 men, with only 100 rifles. The bandits who crossed the river from Yu County came from the Shaomao Tou opposite Luoyu Kou, about 1,000 men. It is confirmed that they were the troops of Liu Zidan and Xu Haidong who joined forces and fled south. In Jijiayuan, Zhongyang, they were attacked by Fang Brigade Zhang Tuan of the National Army. Bandit Liu Zidan was seriously injured and has returned to Yongping Town, Yanchuan, northern Shaanxi, for treatment.</p>
<p>The remaining bandits in northern Shaanxi have rifles for less than half of their number, and the bandit forces are greatly weakened. Currently, only Xu Yubo (Chinese), Litov (Russian) are overseeing near Wazi Fort, with 500 to 600 Red Army soldiers and a Red Army school. Recently, because the bandits who crossed the river to disturb Shanxi suffered too many casualties and it was impossible to recruit replacements, Liu Zidan's pseudo-chief of staff, Du Wenchang, was appointed as the commander of the new division and tried his best to recruit in the hope of replenishing the various combat bandit troops. However, bandit Du was killed by the cavalry of Gao Guizi's division a few days ago and his head was displayed. Moreover, the military affairs of the Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi mostly relied on bandit Du. After his death, not only was the morale of the remaining bandits in northern Shaanxi greatly affected, but also the hope of replenishing the bandit troops fleeing to Shanxi has been dashed.

<p>Han Fuqu Appoints Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Summons all General and Sub-Section Chiefs for Instructions</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, resigned due to illness. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, decided to concurrently serve as the Director of the Bureau because this year's river defense is more difficult than last year. Han decided to concurrently serve as the Director of the Bureau and personally supervise the staff to work hard to defend the river and ensure safety. Zhang Lianjia ordered the various departments and offices of the Bureau to handle the handover last Thursday. Han also ordered all general and sub-section chiefs within the province to come to Jinan to receive instructions. At 7:00 AM on the 27th, Han sent Hou Xitian, Li Yuying, Bian Chongxiu, and Qiu Zhen to the River Affairs Bureau. Hou took over the accounting, Li was responsible for checking all the staff, Bian took over engineering affairs and was responsible for drawing detailed maps, and Qiu handled agricultural and forestry affairs (because the dikes along the river are very long and there is a lot of land, Han wants to develop agricultural and forestry affairs). The handover was completed that day. The former director Zhang Lianjia, along with the general and sub-section chiefs from the upper and lower reaches, the section chiefs of the three sections of the Bureau, the director of the industrial and electrical bureau, and others, went to the Provincial Government to meet Han in the Provincial Chairman's office. Han gave a sincere speech, which lasted for an hour. The main points of his speech were: "I have decided to summon everyone for instructions on a few points. Regarding the breach last year, I feel very sad when I bring this up. The director of the bureau at the time should take responsibility, and you should also take a great deal of responsibility. The breach should not have been a problem. When the water is high and the current is strong, it is difficult to exert force. Just like using troops, victory and defeat are uncertain. Preventing floods is like defending against the enemy. If a breach occurs before taking measures to prevent it, then everyone is to blame." (Speaking to this point, he asked the people around him what the punishment was for breaches in the Qing Dynasty. The people around him replied that all civil and military officials were dismissed and allowed to work, and they would be reinstated after the breach was blocked.) "Regarding the Yellow River, the Central Government has established the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to make overall plans. Although the provinces are still responsible for defense, they must listen to the Central Government's instructions. What I am telling you today is that you must prevent another breach and also look at the results of the tree planting. It must be neat and tidy, looking like a garden. Any kind of tree can be planted on the dike. In recent years, the trees along the river have not developed well. The entire river is a thousand miles long, and the land is no less than six or seven thousand acres, but there is not a single tree that has grown into timber." (Speaking to this point, the sub-section chief Lu Chuanlun reported that it was because willow branches are used for river defense every year, and the cutting is too excessive.) "Another point, the most important thing today is to order the engineering office to draw a rough map of the entire river, clearly marking the county boundaries on both banks, and each sub-section chief should indicate where there are dangerous sections to facilitate defense planning. These two points are the most important. Everyone must not have the mentality of doing things as before, only caring about the present. Do less things, and be sure to be pragmatic and work hard." "Today, I have sent Li Hou to take over. The section chiefs, secretaries, and sub-section chiefs should provide concise resumes, and a list of engineers and soldiers, and inspect the materials. Each sub-section chief should quickly return to their defense area and watch the river water. Every night from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, they can report the water situation and other matters to Secretary Chen in Henan, who will forward them to me. If I am not available, they can report to Secretary-General Zhang or Li Yingchang for processing." According to Lu Province's Yellow River defense can be divided into three periods. In the fifth year of Xianfeng, the Yellow River changed its course to the sea, and no one paid attention to defense, allowing it to flow freely. Later, engineers and soldiers were borrowed from Henan for defense, which can be said to be a period of no defense. By the time of the Guangxu period, Governor Zhang Yao began to build dikes on a large scale and diligently sought governance. At that time, with sufficient financial resources and concentrated manpower, the scale was greatly improved in a few years, which can be said to be a period of river engineering reform. During the era of Zhang Huaizhi's supervision of Shandong in the third year of the Republic of China, due to the lack of river affairs talent in the province, some people familiar with river engineering were transferred from Henan to engage in management. Due to sufficient funding, there were many achievements. When Lao Zhichang took office as the director, he hoped for even better governance, so he reorganized the three routes and rebuilt the dikes. However, due to insufficient financial resources, the construction funds could not be received in a certain spring quarter, and the construction work was abandoned, resulting in a breach at Gongjiaba in the lower reaches. After the success of the revolution in the seventeenth year, Fan Qingxu took office as the director and made specific plans for river management, which were quite complete. However, because 1.6 million yuan was needed, Sun Liangcheng dismissed him from his position. After that, the directors were changed several times, and none of them were able to stay in their positions for long, so there were naturally no achievements to speak of. Zhang Lianjia arrived at the bureau on January 6th of the twentieth year, and as of now, it has been five years and three months. With a long time and no shortage of funds, Zhang has also worked hard, so the achievements are quite remarkable. Ten-thirds of the dams have been replaced with stone, and all the river engineers and soldiers have been trained in stages, which can be said to be a period of river engineering on track. Now that Chairman Han is concurrently serving as the director, the administrative power will be used to assist river affairs in the future, and there may not be a risk of a breach this year.</p>
<p>The Xia Lina Steamboat, Traveling Between Siam and Shantou, Runs Aground</p>
<p>The Location is Outside Shantou Port</p>
<p>Fortunately, All Passengers are Safe</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Shantou-Qianlin shipping line of the Norwegian Dorrison Steamboat Company, which is represented by the Shantou Bonin Company, and in Hong Kong by Qian Tailong, travels regularly between Shantou, Hong Kong, and Qianluo, specializing in carrying passengers and cargo for twelve years. The company has four ships on this route, and the Xia Lina Steamboat is one of them. On the 10th, when the Xia Lina departed from Bangkok, it was loaded with 18,000 bags of rice, 2,000 pieces of general merchandise and timber, and 355 male and female passengers. Due to bad weather along the way, it was delayed until after 4:00 AM on the 19th before arriving outside Shantou Port. It encountered heavy fog and could not see the light of the De Yu Lighthouse, which caused it to run aground. The bow of the ship was stuck in a stone crevice, and the bottom of the stern was damaged and pierced in many places, and water immediately seeped into the rice warehouse. The ship immediately sent a telegram to Shantou Port and other parties for help. In the early morning, the Chao Hai Customs and Bonin Company received the news and immediately notified the Shantou Public Security Bureau and the Cunxin Shantang to provide assistance. De Yu is only ten miles from Shantou by sea, and the voyage can be reached in one hour. The Customs sent the Beidou patrol ship, and the Public Security Bureau also sent patrol boats and inspectors and water police. The Bonin Company rented two electric boats, and the Cunxin Shantang sent a rescue team and many large sailing ships to tow out of the port to provide assistance. At that time, the sun rose in the east, and the fog on the sea dissipated, and the sea was as smooth as a mirror. At 8:00 AM, it sailed to the location where the Xia Lina had an accident and saw the Jiangsu ship, which had returned to Shantou from Siam, stopped there, lowered a sampan, and rescued the Xia Lina passengers to the ship. Because there were many reefs nearby, large ships could not get close. However, it was heard that when the Jiangsu ship and fishing boats rescued passengers, they charged each person four Siamese silver coins to be transported to the Jiangsu ship by fishing boat. It is regrettable that the fishing boats took advantage of the situation. Although the Bonin Company's electric boats and large sailing ships were close to the Xia Lina Steamboat, the seawater had already poured into the second cabin, so they quickly lowered the passengers' luggage and objects in the cabin onto the various sailing ships and transported them to the front of the Customs House, where each person claimed them. The Customs inspectors and police assisted in maintaining order. After this chaotic return, many passengers suffered invisible losses such as picking up the wrong luggage and objects. Fortunately, everyone was safe and was transported in batches until 4:00 PM. As for the rice and general merchandise in the ship, they were also quickly transferred. On the evening of the 19th, more than 2,900 bags of wet rice were recovered. On the 20th, another 6,000 bags were recovered. The tugboat sent from Hong Kong arrived before noon on the 20th. Before noon on the 21st, all the goods were completely recovered. They are now using water pumps to pump out the seawater in the cabin. According to the Bonin Company, they plan to tow it to the Da Jing Ping beach first, repair the hull, and then tow it to the Hong Kong shipyard for repairs. This project will take one or two months at the fastest to complete. The loss of goods this time amounted to more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Committee Allocates Funds</p>
<p>To Improve Ping Shui Green Tea</p>
<p>Establish an Improvement Center to Improve Tea Industry Technology</p>
<p>Reach an Agreement with the Zhejiang Construction Department on Cooperation Methods</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Chinese tea has always dominated the world. Forty years ago, it was at its peak. The annual export volume of Chinese tea was often more than 2 million dan. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was still 1.48 million dan. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, it fell to 300,000 dan, which was the most depressed period. In recent years, it has gradually increased to 600,000 to 700,000 dan, but it is only one-third of what it was forty years ago. In the world's recent total annual tea trade of 900 million pounds (about 7 million dan), Chinese tea accounts for only 10%. In terms of price, black tea has improved slightly, while green tea has declined. Since foreign tea has flourished, our country's black tea is threatened by India, Ceylon, and Java, and green tea is threatened by Japan. Foreign markets have been plundered, and domestic markets have also been gradually invaded. Foreign black tea sells 20 million pounds in the mainland every year, and the popularity of Taiwan tea in Fujian is even more alarming. If we do not take measures to save it, the future of the tea industry will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Decline in Production and Sales</p>
<p>Zhejiang is an important tea producing area in China. The most famous teas produced are Ping Shui green tea and Qimen black tea, which are the main players in international trade, and the export volume even exceeds that of Qimen black tea. Longjing, Qiqiang, Liuan, Wuyi, and Pu'er are all treasures of domestic sales, and their shapes, colors, fragrances, and tastes are quite prominent. The total annual tea production in the province is more than 400,000 dan, worth 20 million yuan, accounting for more than one-third of the total export value of Zhejiang's native products. Ping Shui green tea and Wenzhou black tea used to be exported from Shanghai, mostly to the United States, and were very honorable. However, due to the temporary demand exceeding supply and poor commercial organization, tea merchants reduced costs to make profits, and tried to adulterate and color the tea. Everyone followed suit, which led to the deterioration of the quality of Zhejiang tea and the decline in prices. The production volume and sales also decreased as a result. The entire tea industry economy is declining. If we can engage in improvement, improve quality and increase production volume with scientific methods, and transport and sell to existing markets, we will still be able to obtain warm welcome from consumers and have a good chance of revival.</p>
<p>Ping Shui Tea Area</p>
<p>The Ping Shui tea producing area mainly includes seven counties: Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Shangyu, Zhuji, Shengxian, Xinchang, and Yuyao. The Zhejiang Construction Department should have selected the center of the tea area, the barren land of Haoba Lion Mountain in Shangyu County, which has convenient land and water transportation and good soil quality, in March of last year to establish the Haoba Tea Farm. The mountains there are flat, and the area, including the nearby Embroidery Ball Mountain, is about ten square miles, totaling more than 5,000 acres. 1,000 acres have been cultivated, and more than 300,000 tea seedlings of various types have been planted. A tea industry guidance office has also been established to provide technical guidance to tea farmers in the Ping Shui area. However, due to limited funds, development is difficult. Since Wu Tingsou took over as the Director of the Construction Department, he believed that the development of production and construction must start with improving the province's inherent special products. It was decided to expand and rebuild the original Haoba Lion Mountain newly cultivated tea farm into the Ping Shui Tea Industry Improvement Farm, responsible for handling the improvement of cultivation, manufacturing, and sales matters. However, due to the province's financial difficulties, there was no funding for the start-up. It was requested from the National Economic Committee to subsidize 40,000 yuan in funding in accordance with the Qimen Improvement Farm method. The committee replied by sending Zhao Lianfang, Director of the Agricultural Department, to Zhejiang. The Construction Department sent Zhang Tianyi, Section Chief, and others to accompany him to inspect the Ping Shui tea area. It was believed that it was necessary to improve it in the same way as Qimen. After both parties agreed, they discussed and decided on the method of cooperating with the Zhejiang Province of the Economic Committee to improve green tea and establish a tea industry improvement farm. The start-up cost of 40,000 yuan was to be shared equally by the Economic Committee and the Zhejiang Construction Department. The recurring cost of 12,000 yuan per year was to be allocated from the provincial agricultural and forestry expenses. The Construction Department has already submitted a request to the Economic Committee for funding, so that it can be realized as soon as possible. The main points of the plan to establish a special improvement farm are explored and recorded below:</p>
<p>Improvement Plan</p>
<p>Land Acquisition: This year, it is planned to first acquire 10 acres of construction land, 30 acres of nursery land, and 960 acres of tea land. The price per acre is 10 yuan, totaling 10,000 yuan. The acquisition procedures will be handled by the Shangyu County Government under the order of the Construction Department.</p>
<p>Building Construction: The tea industry improvement farm's buildings are planned to build six offices, including one office and five research offices, as well as ten initial processing workshops, twenty replication workshops, ten warehouses, three cold storage rooms, and staff dormitories.</p>
<p>Purchase of Machinery: This will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase, four tea steaming machines, ten tea frying machines, ten tea kneading machines, and ten tea drying machines will be purchased from Shanghai, as well as two 20-horsepower engines. In the second phase, new-style tea-making machinery will be purchased from Britain and Japan to prepare for expansion.</p>
<p>Improve and Expand Tea Gardens: The original Haoba Lion Mountain newly cultivated tea gardens have mostly not been improved in terms of topography. Roads should continue to be built, drainage ditches should be improved, and the area should be expanded to become a large-scale tea garden.</p>
<p>Conduct Experiments and Improvements: Experiments and improvements are the main purpose of the tea farm. A detailed business plan should be established before the start of each year, and various experiments and research on breeding, cultivation, and manufacturing should be implemented seriously. After the results are available, the promotion department should cooperate with the tea industry guidance offices in various regions to carry out widespread promotion. (April 29th)</p>

<p>Robberies Occur in Nantang Township</p>
<p>The home of Yang Yunqing, a villager from the 5th Bao, 10th Jia, Nantang Township, 8th District of Punan, was suddenly visited by more than ten bandits last night. They spoke in a strong Hakka accent and carried pistols, flashlights, and hemp ropes. They jumped in through the back window, tied up Yang's wife, Qi, and injured her face. They searched for about an hour and carried the stolen goods out the front door. More than 20 pieces of cotton clothing were stolen. On the same night, the home of Wu Dazhong, a villager from the 7th Bao, 3rd Jia, 11th household of the same township, was also robbed. However, the victims did not report the incident because the losses were small. After the police chief of the Shanyang Patrol Office, Xuan Jinquan, learned of the incident, he went to inspect the scene and reported it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Person in Charge of "Wang Baochuan" Film Detained</p>
<p>The Shanghai Guangyi Film Company sent a large number of actors to Suzhou to shoot the film "Wang Baochuan." All the items used were temporarily borrowed from the Suzhou Film Studio. However, the script of "Wang Baochuan" had not been approved by the Central Film Censorship Committee, and the film was shot privately. The matter was learned by the Central Film Censorship Committee, which sent inspection team leader Li Gongke and inspector Wang to Suzhou to inspect the Suzhou Film Studio together with officials from the Public Security Bureau. They seized 3,000 feet of the already filmed "Wang Baochuan" film and telegraphed the Central Film Censorship Committee. Director Luo personally came to Suzhou and inspected again, and found a large number of items that should have been used, such as broadswords and costumes. Therefore, Wang Weiqing, the person in charge of the "Wang Baochuan" film, was immediately detained and temporarily detained by the Third Public Security Bureau. Director Luo took the seized 3,000 feet of film to Nanjing for review on the morning of the 29th. Hong Ji, the host of the "Wang Shichuan" film, had already left Suzhou for Shanghai with his family on the evening of the 28th. It is said that Hong Ji has been taken to Nanjing by Director Luo. Wei Wei, director of the Suzhou Film Studio, happened to be in Wujiang recently performing a new type of drama. Upon hearing this news, he returned to Suzhou on the 29th.</p>

<p>Attempted Robbery of a Widow Results in Death</p>
<p>Cao, a widow in Kandian Village, Panshu Town, Fourth District of Wuyi, was recently forcibly robbed by more than 20 hooligans. When the hooligans were leaving, they fired a gun as a warning, injuring Xu Hai's daughter, Suzhen, a farmer. Xu Haisheng sent her to the Wujin Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the injury was in the large intestine, and she died on the 28th. Her father mourned her death and transported her body back for burial.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Two Robberies Occur in the Urban Area</p>
<p>The home of Pan Yunzhi, a resident of No. 19 Xinmiaoqian in the city of this county, was suddenly visited by two middle-aged men at around 7:00 PM on the night before (the 28th). They went straight into the living room and suddenly took out a pistol, claiming to be detectives here to search for contraband. At that time, Pan Yunzhi and his wife, and their cohabitant surnamed Cao, were all in the living room. When they saw the pistol, they were all dumbfounded. The two bandits robbed Pan's wallet in his pocket, which contained 20 yuan in legal tender. Pan's wife, Zhang, had a gold ring on her hand, and her sister-in-law's gold ring was also seized. The bandits then searched the bedroom but found nothing, so they fled east. The victim, Pan Yunzhi, immediately reported to the First Branch for investigation. The branch chief, Hong, sent police officers to investigate, but they were unsuccessful. Also, near the Liangtang Bridge in Mawan Village, Zhouxin Town, Third District, there was always a fishing boat owned by the boatman Gao Mingjin, who made a living by fishing. At around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, six or seven bandits suddenly tied up Mingjin's entire family, wife, and daughter with ropes and threw them into the wheat field. The bandits then robbed a fishing boat and a large net worth more than 200 yuan. The victim, Gao Mingjin, was heartbroken because all of his life's efforts were here, and he cried all day long. He has now reported to the Eighth Branch, which is in charge, for investigation.</p>
<p>Elementary School Principal Commits Suicide Due to Love Failure</p>
<p>Yang Xingruo, the principal of Jiangbiqiao Elementary School outside the South Gate, Second District of the county, is 36 years old. He graduated from the Railway Management Department of Nanyang University in Shanghai and served as the former District Chief and Administrative Director of the Second District. He has one wife and one concubine. Suddenly, Yang committed suicide by drowning in the river near Jiangbiqiao at around 8:00 PM last night. When he was spotted by someone, he was rescued ashore. However, he had drunk too much water and could not be revived, and he died. As for the reason for Yang's suicide, it is rumored that Yang had a love affair with Ms. Chen, a female teacher at Jiangbiqiao Elementary School (19 years old). However, the matter was not kept secret and was known by Yang's wife and concubine. There was jealousy and discord in the family. Ms. Chen also refused Yang's courtship because Yang already had a wife, concubine, and children, resulting in failure in love and this tragedy.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<p>Three Robbers Executed</p>
<p>Du Guohan, Li Shichang, Xu Mingding, Zhao Guozhong, Chen Tiancai, and other robbers who robbed the home of Yin Lianyi outside the Xizha Gate in Nanxun on the night of January 20th of this year were arrested by the Seventh Independent Detachment of the Wuxing County Security Regiment on the 29th of the same month. Du Guohan, Li Shichang, Xu Mingding and other three people were arrested first, and the stolen goods were found. The detachment sent the three robbers to the Wuxing District Command for interrogation. After a strict interrogation by the Wuxing military judge, and after the owner was brought to the case for questioning, the identification was accurate, and the report was submitted to the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government. After the Military Affairs Commission approved the report, it ordered the execution by shooting. At 1:30 PM yesterday, the Wuxing Jiang Command Department took the three criminals out, verified their identities, tied them up, and sent them to the South Parade Ground for execution by shooting.</p>
<p>Recent Cultural Developments in the City of Culture</p>
<p>Special Correspondence from Beiping</p>
<p>Last year, a certain higher education authority here said something meaningful: "China no longer has military defense in Beiping, but only cultural defense." At first glance, linking "culture" and "defense" together seems inappropriate, but since the fall of the various passes of the Great Wall in the 22nd year, the signing of the Tanggu Truce Agreement, until last year, after the so-called Meijin-He Yingqin Agreement, in this situation where China is increasing its defenses with freedom and China's garrison is subject to various restrictions, what national defense can China talk about here? Those of us who live here often have the same feeling, which is that if all the cultural institutions in Beiping were removed, then no one would be able to tell whether Beiping belongs to China. Certain country's ronin, Koreans, and even "Manchukuo" officials and "Hebei-East Autonomous Government" officials can walk around the park with their heads held high. Foreign soldiers in red caps are always bumping into each other in the shopping malls. The shops are full of certain country's goods, and advertisements for Lao Du eye drops, University eye drops, etc. are plastered all over the streets and corners. Even the paper used to wrap peanuts in small shops is made of scraps of old Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, or Asahi Shimbun, etc. Under these circumstances, the only thing that can often evoke memories in people's minds and make people aware that they are still within Chinese territory is these cultural institutions and the activities of the people engaged in cultural work. Linking "culture" and "defense" together is ridiculous and sad, but what makes us even more sad is that if we want to find China's national defense here, then apart from this ridiculous and sad so-called "cultural defense," there is really nothing.</p>
<p>The first thing worth mentioning is naturally the activities of the students in various schools. Last year's "December 9th" and "December 16th" demonstrations, as well as the southward expansion propaganda led by the Student Union, added together, made the Beiping student movement to save the country comparable to the Egyptian student anti-British movement, and became the two most meaningful movements in the world last year. There are four national universities,</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke met with reporters at his residence on the morning of the 29th, freely discussing his impressions of this trip.

According to the engineers, the first phase of the Huai River guidance project will be completed in just over a month. The total cost of the Huai River guidance project is estimated at tens of thousands of tens of thousands of yuan, of which two or three thousand tens of thousands of yuan have already been spent. If there are no financial difficulties in the future, the entire Huai River guidance project can be completed within five years. Later, he talked about the plan to coordinate the relief of the rural economy with government power based on the principle of cooperation, which has now been submitted for detailed research and is unlikely to be completed in the short term. How it will be implemented in the future is also undecided. (29th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Mr. Eastman, Director of the Overseas Department of the International Labour Office (ILO), arrived in Shanghai from Japan a few days ago. Yesterday morning, he visited Mayor Wu and attended his luncheon. The ILO China Branch held a tea party for Mr. Eastman at 5:00 PM at the International Hotel. After 7:00 PM, he attended a banquet hosted by the Pacific International Association. After inspecting various factories and labor conditions in Shanghai, Mr. Eastman will go to Beijing on the 3rd of next month to visit our government authorities, then travel to Beiping before returning to Canada via Japan. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting the Mayor</p>
<p>Mr. Eastman, Director of the Overseas Department of the ILO, was originally scheduled to attend the Asian Labor Conference in Japan. After the conference was cancelled, Mr. Eastman took the opportunity to come to China from Japan to inspect labor conditions. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and stayed at the Cathay Hotel. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, accompanied by Mr. Cheng Haifeng, Director of the ILO China Branch, Mr. Eastman took a car to the municipal government to visit Mayor Wu. Mayor Wu, along with Secretary Tang Shixuan, received him warmly and led him to visit the construction of Greater Shanghai. Mr. Eastman expressed his admiration for the vigorous construction in this city. He departed at 11:00 AM. At noon, he attended a luncheon hosted by the Mayor at his private residence on Haig Road, accompanied by senior municipal officials.</p>
<p>Welcome Tea Party</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Haifeng, Director of the ILO China Branch, held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM at the ballroom on the 14th floor of the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to welcome Mr. Eastman. Attendees included Mr. and Mrs. Eastman, Cheng Haifeng, Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu, (Representative of Wang Zhinan), Zhao Tiezhang, Lu Jingshi, Zhou Xuexiang, Wang Zhisheng, Lin Kanghou, Zaiboqi, Zhang Kechang, Ye Xianggao, Long Peiyun, Chuan Dewei, Li Mengnan, Yang Youren, Sun Liping, Zhao Shusheng, Canadian Trade Commissioner to China McDonald, and Mrs. Smith. Director Cheng and Section Chief He Tingzhen warmly welcomed the guests and served tea and refreshments. As this was Mr. Eastman's first visit to China, Mr. Cheng introduced and conversed with him individually. The guests and hosts were extremely harmonious. The Pacific International Association hosted a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Eastman at the International YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road last night at 7:00 PM. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese Seamen's Union, the National Postal Workers' Union, and the National Postal Employees' Union, among other industrial and commercial organizations, are also scheduled to jointly host a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Eastman at the New Asia Restaurant at 7:30 PM this afternoon. The Canadian Trade Commissioner to China will also host a banquet tomorrow.</p>
<p>Remarks by Mr. Eastman</p>
<p>When the reporter met with Mr. Eastman at the International Hotel's ILO Branch tea party yesterday and asked about his future itinerary and the general situation of overseas labor, he said that this was his first visit to China since taking office as Director of the ILO's Overseas Department (the Overseas Department includes the Americas and Asia outside of Europe). He had long heard about the progress of China's material construction and had been eager to visit, but he had few opportunities. This time, he was originally dispatched by the ILO to attend the Asian Labor Conference scheduled to be held this year in Japan. However, he received a notice of cancellation during the trip and took this opportunity to visit your country to inspect labor conditions and make the most enjoyable trip of his life. After arriving here, he was especially grateful for the special hospitality of Director Cheng and the industrial circles. He had visited factories under the guidance of Mr. Cheng the day before and had a very good impression. He hopes to continue to visit other major factories and inspect general labor conditions during his stay here for the next few days. On the 3rd of next month, he will go to Beijing with Mr. Cheng to visit your government authorities. After finishing his business, he will travel north to Beiping, then return to Canada via Japan. Regarding the current situation of overseas labor, the following can be mentioned: Countries that have abolished the gold standard, such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland, have seen improvements in their economic situation, so they have been able to use enterprises to hire more workers and produce and export goods in large quantities. Countries that have adopted the gold standard, such as France, are still in a state of economic panic. In fact, they hire the majority of workers, but the production of goods is limited, with the aim of avoiding overproduction. Therefore, the situation is slightly worse than in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. However, many countries are in a special situation, namely, they can employ a large number of workers as much as possible in the military field, undertaking military work, so the number of unemployed workers is reduced. In the Americas, since Roosevelt became President of the United States, he has been vigorously engaged in reforms of the social system. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court did not approve of Roosevelt's social and economic reform plans, so they could not be fully realized. However, the reforms that have been carried out have fully demonstrated a phenomenon of recovery, and the labor situation has improved slightly. China is a newly emerging industrial country in the world, and the development of its industrial future is immeasurable. In my opinion, China should have legal provisions for the protection of workers at present, so as to avoid the regret of not being able to take measures when industrial development reaches its highest level.</p>

We hereby notify you to send ten representatives to attend the meeting and participate in the grand event. Please do not delay. We hereby notify you."</p>
<p>Citywide Shutdown</p>
<p>"May 1st" is International Labor Day. In order to express their warm celebration, all trade unions in the city have decided to follow the factory law promulgated by the central government and have workers stop work for one day on that day. In addition to the trade unions directly notifying all workers to stop work, they have also sent letters to the factories informing them to pay wages as usual. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has already decided to transfer all the wages for the May 1st commemorative worker shutdown to purchase machines for birthday celebrations, and has submitted a request to the municipal government to order all manufacturers to deduct the amount on their behalf.</p>

<p>Shanghai Lawyers Association members Zhang Shijie, Yang Li, Yan Yinwu and others have suggested to consider increasing the number of representatives to the National Assembly. The association sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan yesterday, which reads: "To Sun, President of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, and all members, upon reading the Shenbao of April 25, regarding the number of representatives of free professional groups to the National Assembly, the Standing Committee decided to be 58, of which the number of representatives of lawyers groups was considered too high by Committee Member Dai Chuanxian, and it was suggested to reduce it. Lawyers are widespread throughout the country, numbering tens of thousands, and their position in society and the country is also very important. Moreover, the main task of the Central Government in convening the National Assembly is to formulate a constitution and exercise the powers conferred by the constitution. If representatives of lawyers groups attend with a considerable number of representatives, they will contribute more to the constitutional cause, and it will also be beneficial to the vigorous implementation of the rule of law. The number of representatives should be appropriately increased in accordance with the central allocation principle, which is more appropriate. We hereby telegraph to your esteemed Yuan, and when deliberating on the number of representatives of the lawyers groups to the National Assembly, please make an appropriate increase. The future of the rule of law is very fortunate. Shanghai Lawyers Association."</p>

The association knew that the Central Standing Committee would meet today, so it telegraphed Qian to petition nearby, and also telegraphed the Central Standing Committee, which reads: "To the Central Standing Committee of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the principles of the election law passed at the Sixth National Congress originally included the participation of industrial groups, but it was later deleted and the eligibility was lost.

<p>The Shanghai Times News reported that the special zone telephone problem committee and the telephone company have reached a stalemate regarding the issue of user fees. Many users in various districts have been inquiring about payment methods to the committee in recent days. The committee has replied to them separately, as follows: The Fourth Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Union sent a letter to the Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee, and the committee replied: "Regarding the letter, refusing to pay telephone fees is a passive countermeasure to the telephone company's decision to charge fees. We should insist to the end, and this determination will not change until the goal of canceling the new rules is achieved. In addition to our committee ignoring the company's final notice and cutting off the telephone line today to show our responsibility, we hereby reply and ask you to inform us." The committee also replied to Taixiang Yanhao and Jianguang Guiyuanhao: "Regarding the letter, refusing to pay telephone fees is a passive countermeasure to the telephone company's decision to charge fees by the number of calls. We should insist to the end, and this determination will not change until the goal of canceling the new rules is achieved. Your firm's ability to lead by example, take care of the interests of all users, and support our committee's struggle with its spirit of unity and strength of determination is admirable. Other users are inspired and will surely follow suit. Once there are too many disconnections, the telephone company will inevitably panic. The ultimate victory depends on the unity of purpose of the majority of our users. We hereby reply and ask you to take note."</p>

<h3 id="e89">Economic Situation of Tongren Hospital <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Tongren Hospital in this city published its 1935 report, stating that the 727,000 yuan in donations accumulated by the hospital over 20 years was intended to be used to build a new hospital, school, and laboratory building. The funds were either deposited in the Mei Feng Bank and Puyi Silver Company or loaned to Puyi Real Estate Company. The collapse of the Mei Feng Bank caused a major blow to the hospital's finances. The planned building will be postponed indefinitely. At most, it is hoped that 60% of the deposited funds can be recovered, and most of that will come from Puyi Real Estate Company. Due to poor market conditions last year and the large influx of refugees from disaster areas into Shanghai, the hospital suffered a deficit of 6,000 yuan at the end of the year. Most of these refugees who came to the hospital were unable to pay, and because their fields and houses were flooded, they had nowhere to go. Sometimes the hospital even provided them with small amounts of money to help them get on their feet in Shanghai. Last year, a total of 16,335 yuan in donations was received, and 29,698 yuan in assistance was provided by the Municipal Council and American churches. There were a total of 113,300 outpatient visits and 3,000 inpatients. It is hoped that enthusiastic philanthropists will continue to generously provide assistance so that the hospital's expenses can be balanced.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Yangtze River Shipping Experiencing Unprecedented Decline, Less Than Two-Fifths of What It Was Four Years Ago; Only Japanese Ships' Business Holds the Top Position <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Yangtze River is the richest area for Chinese native products, and is the central region for the production of various grains. From Shanghai to Hankou, the purchasing power of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei is the strongest, especially for imported goods, with salt and sugar being the main food products. Therefore, foreign ships operating on this route are doing everything they can to compete for business. Since the January 28th Incident, each year has been worse than the last, and the volume of goods shipped has</p>
<p>Plummeted</p>
<p>Compared to four years ago, it is less than two-fifths. The main reason for this year's sharp decline in shipping is the depletion of social finances. The purchasing power of the people along the river has been greatly reduced. In previous years, those handling goods could obtain financing from banks and money shops, and the recipients of the goods could pay after selling them. Therefore, the flow of goods was not hindered. This year, the banking industry has restricted lending, and all goods must be</p>
<p>Transacted in Cash</p>
<p>This has bound those handling goods with financial restrictions, making procurement and transportation impossible. This is the biggest reason for the sharp decline in Yangtze River shipping. The six Yangtze River shipping companies have been continuously losing money for three years. Last year, they changed their approach and formed an alliance to share profits and losses. Although freight rates have been increased and commissions reduced, the volume of goods coming and going is less than in previous years. Even with the alliance, they are still losing money. Now, the six companies are planning to</p>
<p>Increase Freight Rates, Including a One-Tenth Increase in Shallow Water Freight Rates, to Make Up for the Losses. However, the volume of packaged goods has already been fundamentally taken away by Yangzi Company ships that do not participate in the profit-sharing alliance, as well as the diversion of cargo to postal packages, sailing ships, and trains. As a result, there is even less cargo being transported to the Yangtze River from this area. Starting in April, the Yangtze River ships of a certain large company among the six companies are sometimes only carrying one-tenth to two-tenths of their capacity on each voyage. Even the best ones are only carrying four-tenths to five-tenths of their cargo. When reporters inquired with various customs brokers on this route, it was claimed that Yangtze River customs brokers have always paid customs duties on behalf of customers three times a year. Now, the new regulations of the customs require</p>
<p>Monthly Tax Payments, Which many customs brokers cannot afford to pay, so they have to reduce their business. This is also one of the reasons for the decrease in Yangtze River freight. Furthermore, the volume of domestic sugar being transported to the Yangtze River has always been large, but now, due to the sharp drop in the price of smuggled sugar, the sales of domestic sugar on the Yangtze River have been invisibly affected. Normally, during the flood season, the business of Yangtze River ships is supposed to improve, but this year is different. If there is no turnaround in April of the lunar calendar, then there is no hope for the Yangtze River ships' business in the latter half of this year. As for goods coming downstream, since rice has been banned from being exported from Jiujiang, Wuhu, Changsha, and other ports, there is no longer any transportation of miscellaneous grains downstream. Only</p>
<p>Japanese Ships on the Yangtze River, Because They Have a Large Volume of Transit Cargo Coming and Going, Have Been Occupying the Top Position in the Entire Yangtze River Shipping Business, Regardless of Whether They Participate in the Profit-Sharing Alliance. The Changsha route in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River is slightly better, while the section between Hankou and Yichang is even more superior due to the large volume of goods being transferred to ships going to Sichuan. Shanghai direct ships to Chongqing experienced a surge in cargo due to President Chiang's recent decision to go to Sichuan. The Fuyang ship of the Sanbei Company, which departed on the 2nd, was already fully loaded yesterday. Those who registered to ship cargo later even had no space available.</p>

At about 2:15 AM yesterday morning, Cai Baoshan, 38 years old, a native of Pudong, gathered a few friends to play the game of "Bamboo Forest". Later, he cooked a midnight meal but left the fire unattended. Suddenly, a fire started, and flames spread rapidly, with black smoke billowing up. The fire was like a prairie fire, instantly burning down seven houses and three floors. The fire department rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which was extinguished at 4:30 AM. The losses are said to be heavy, but all were insured. The fire starter, Cai Baoshan, was detained in the police station for delivery to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Guo Yuequan, Wang Ruling, and Yang Zhaoqing, Chinese detectives from the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police, learned that Yang Yonglin, a native of Shaoxing, was secretly selling the drug red pills for profit inside No. 83 Yangshupu Road. Therefore, the other day they sent an informant to purchase the pills, which proved to be true. They then coordinated with Western Detective Chief Bo Pu to arrest Yang at that address, seizing 900 drug pills and a bundle of wrapping paper. Under questioning, Yang confessed that he obtained the red pills from Chen Sanda, a native of Changshu at No. 30 Yunnan Road. The detectives took Yang to Chen and arrested him, seizing only one red pill and a bill. Chen confessed that the headquarters was located on the third floor of the Japanese-owned Yuanshang Shoe Store at No. 813 North Sichuan Road. The detectives obtained an arrest warrant from the Japanese consulate and went to the location with Japanese detectives. The location was on a road built beyond the concession. They also coordinated with detectives from the local Public Security Bureau and quietly entered the premises. They encountered Yuanshang Jinzhi, the young owner of the shoe store, who claimed that the matter was a collaboration between his father, Yuanshang Outailang, and the Chinese. After a while, Outailang arrived and was arrested. He confessed that he personally established the organization and that there were no Chinese involved. The detectives then went up to the third floor to inspect the location where the drug pills were manufactured. The scale was grand, with 66 bags of manufactured drug pills, totaling 120,000 pills, and several bags of unfinished pills, 40 taels of heroin, and a large quantity of white powder materials. One Chinese man and one Chinese woman were arrested, along with equipment such as machines and coal boxes, and taken to the Public Security Bureau. Yuanshang Outailang, Yang, and Chen, the two drug dealers, were taken back to the police station. Outailang was sent to the Japanese consulate for questioning. Yesterday morning, Yang Yonglin and Chen Sanda were handed over to Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, explained the case, stating that the man named Chen Zibing and the woman named Guo Ding, who were seized at the factory, were detained at the Public Security Bureau. He requested that the court issue an official letter to transfer them to the Shanghai District Court. The case was postponed for further investigation, it was said. Following the report of the Chinese and Western detectives clarifying the process of solving the case and questioning the two defendants, their statements were evasive. Judge Xiao Xieffen ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>Chen Caifu (aka Chen Asi), formerly a detective in the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, had opened a laundry business at 337 Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession. During the past year, Chen was detained by the Garrison Headquarters due to a crime, and his wife, Chen Wu (age 23), took over the business. Unexpectedly, Chen's older brother, Chen Aming, seeing that Wu was a vulnerable woman, frequently asked her for loans. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, Chen Aming, taking advantage of Wu's return to her hometown for tomb sweeping, led his wife, Cheng, his nephew, Baoqi, Shi Xiushi, and several others to Wu's house. They took away clothing, jewelry, silver coins, and other items worth over three hundred yuan. Upon Wu's return to Shanghai and learning of this, she filed a theft lawsuit against her brother-in-law and others with the French Concession police. The police obtained a confession and ordered Detective Mao Anfu to arrest all the individuals involved and recover the stolen goods. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Special Court's Eighth Criminal Division, where the police charged them with theft. After Judge Chen Pusheng questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Beggar Accused of Extortion and Fraud, Using Lanterns with Red Paper as a Signal, Another Robbery Case Under Investigation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Wang Asi, a beggar from Pudong, was arrested on Zhongshan Road in Zhabei the other day by Chinese Detective Zhu Mengwei and Zhu Hanbo of the Gordon Road Police Station, in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau. He was transferred to the police station and, yesterday morning, was sent to the First Special Court's Eighth Criminal Division. He was prosecuted for extortion and fraud under Article 346 of the Criminal Code. Zhang Tianyin, the police's lawyer, then presented the case, stating that Tan Lixing (also known as Tan Magen and Tan Ama), a local bill collector for Deutz &amp; Gelder, located at 20 Jiujiang Road, residing at 94, Lane 617, Xiaoshadu Road, suddenly received a threatening letter from a criminal gang on the 24th of this month. The letter contained intimidating language and sought to extort money. It stated that if he agreed, he should put a piece of red paper on his door; they would put a white paper on theirs. However, if he put a white paper, Tan's two sons might face unfavorable consequences in the future. The ransom demanded was twenty thousand yuan. Tan reported the letter to the Gordon Road Police Station, which ordered him to comply and secretly dispatched detectives to Tan's vicinity to monitor the situation. The following day, Tan received a second letter stating that the red paper had been seen. Now that he was willing to pay, he was asked to provide five hundred yuan for travel expenses to be sent to the Xinzha Bridge. The criminal gang would send a child carrying a lantern with Tan Magen's red paper on it to make contact. Tan again reported to the police station, which dispatched detectives in conjunction with Public Security Bureau detectives to lay an ambush in all directions. At the appointed time, the defendant indeed approached carrying a lantern and contacted Tan. Tan handed over a paper package containing one yuan in legal tender and a bundle of banknotes from his bank to Wang Asi, who hid it in a basket. He was arrested while walking along Zhongshan Road. Currently, the case is requested to be postponed because the home of Zhu Chengde, located at 156, Lane 617, Xiaoshadu Road, was robbed on February 24th of this year. It was found that Zhu and Tan lived in the same lane. Afterwards, Zhu Chengde suddenly received a letter from the robbers stating that they had intended to rob the home of Tan Magen but had mistakenly robbed his residence, for which they were deeply sorry. Therefore, the police need to investigate this point. Furthermore, according to Tan Lixing's testimony, the defendant Wang Asi confessed that he was a beggar. Yesterday, someone gave him ten copper coins and a lantern and instructed him to wait at the Xinzha Bridge, leading to his arrest. Judge Tan reviewed the confession and ordered Wang to be detained pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Sun Yin Abuses Maid to Death, Forensic Examination Completed, Prosecutor Files Indictment, Trial Result Awaits Investigation <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Sun Yin, a local woman, lived at 43 Shagang, Gaoqiao, Pudong. In August of last year, she bought a six-year-old girl named Donglan as a maid through an intermediary. Because the girl was young and somewhat clumsy, Sun Yin felt that she was disobedient and often beat her. On December 30th, Donglan somehow fell and injured her head, resulting in her death. Neighbors, feeling indignant, falsely used the name Huang Zhiqiang and reported the incident to the local police station, requesting a thorough investigation into the abuse leading to death. Upon receiving the order, the police station detained Sun Yin and sent her to the District Court. Prosecutor Li Xulin, along with examiners, went to the countryside to exhume and examine the body, but the true cause of death was unclear. Therefore, Donglan's body was sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for autopsy. It is now learned that the Forensic Institute has completed the autopsy, and its examination report has been sent to the court. Prosecutor Li has filed a public indictment against Sun Yin in accordance with the law. The indictment states that Sun Yin bought Donglan to be her maid, and reviewing the original case file sent by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, it has been verified that this is the case. Therefore, Sun Yin's claim that she adopted Donglan to be a daughter and companion, and not a maid, is not credible. Her actions constitute a violation of Article 296, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. The part concerning the death will be dealt with separately. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Cai Dingcheng of the Criminal Division of the Third Court presided over the trial. The defendant Sun Yin hired lawyers Jin Yu and Fang Gang to defend her. Sun Yin testified that she was 45 years old and adopted Donglan, a six-year-old girl from Shalang, last year as a foster daughter, not a maid. Huang Jincai, the local bailiff, testified that Donglan was indeed Sun Yin's foster daughter. Lawyer Jin then requested the court to investigate the household registration office of the local police station to determine whether the deceased Donglan was his foster daughter or a maid. Judge Cai reviewed the testimony and ordered the case to be postponed for further investigation. The defendant remained on bail.</p>

<p>Wu Lusheng, a local resident, 47 years old, solely owned Wu Zhenxing Hardware Store at 491 Mei Bai Ge Road and Zhenxing Hardware Store at 621 Henan Road. His first wife had passed away early, leaving behind three sons. He then married Tang, a woman from Pudong, as his second wife. They have been married for over ten years and have a child each. Recently, Tang requested that her husband divide the family property equally among all the children, but Wu insisted that, according to old customs, the sons of the first wife were the eldest and should receive a larger share. Tang opposed this, leading to a rift in the couple's relationship and frequent arguments. Recently, after the marriage of Wu's first wife's adopted daughter and the birth of a daughter on the 15th of this month, Tang's demand for property division became even stronger. Furthermore, she recently received a threatening letter stating that Tang's son would be kidnapped, exacerbating the conflict. On the 21st of this month, Tang suddenly took 754 yuan in cash and checks worth 1,946 yuan from the Zhenxing Hardware Store's cashier, Tang Huajie, and left without saying goodbye. Cao Shouzheng (26 years old), an employee of the Zhenxing Hardware Store from Changzhou, also disappeared. Wu reported this to the General Police Station and requested an investigation. Some days ago, a Wang, a friend of Wu's hardware store, suddenly received a letter from Cao from Room 46 of the Daxin Hotel in Suzhou, stating that Tang had an important suitcase in the store and asked him to keep it safe. The letter also stated that he was going to Wuxi. Based on this clue, Wu Lusheng and others went to Wuxi and arrested Tang and Cao in Room 26 of the New World Hotel. They were temporarily detained in the Wuxi Public Security Bureau. Wu notified the police station, and Chinese Detective Gao Zhen brought a public letter from the First Special Court to the Wuxi Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, he transferred Tang and Cao to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the situation and filed a lawsuit under Article 320 and Article 324, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. He also stated that, according to Yang Linzhi, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, there might be evidence of adultery between Tang and Cao Shouzheng, which is still under investigation. Moreover, much evidence remains at the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, so he requested a postponement for further investigation. According to Tang's testimony, she fled to Suzhou temporarily because of a dispute with her husband and after receiving the threatening letter. She claimed that she met Cao Shouzheng on the train and that he said his nanny, Xu Qian, was afraid she would commit suicide, so she asked him to follow and watch over her. Xu Qian testified in court that she saw the owner's wife and Cao taking the owner's wife's child and riding in a rickshaw together. Tang also hired Jiang Yiping as her lawyer. Judge Chuan Lin reviewed the testimony and ordered a postponement for further interrogation. Wu Tang was released on a bail of 5,000 yuan from the store. Cao was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Yonghetang Pharmacy, located at 23 Shunqing Lane, Lane 7, Shanxi Road, was opened by Shi Zhenghua from Shaoxing. Shi passed away due to illness on June 12, 1934, and the pharmacy was then managed by his eldest son, Shi Yuanlong (also known as Wenlong). Two types of phlegm-relieving and cough-suppressing drugs produced by the pharmacy, "Kumquat Frost" and "Pinellia Ferment," had a wide sales network, especially inland. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau tested these two drugs and found that they contained toxic substances such as morphine, codeine, and noscapine. The bureau sent a letter to the First Special District Court to investigate. The Special Court issued an order to the General Police Station. Chinese Detective Su Changsheng and Detective Ni Jiaxin purchased the aforementioned drugs from the pharmacy. Then the Police Lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a public prosecution according to Article 257 of the Criminal Law. Under the interrogation of the First Special Court, Shi Yuanlong paid 1,000 yuan in bail to wait for the drug test results for further verification. During the postponement period, the First Special Court received official documents from Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces, stating that the above-mentioned two drugs contained toxic substances. The First Special Court sent the remaining doses of the two drugs tested by the Shanghai Municipal Health Testing Institute on January 11 and March 13, 1932, as well as those purchased by the police this time, to the Forensic Institute of the Ministry of Administration of the same court for testing. The institute has now reported the testing results to the court. Therefore, yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye opened the First Criminal Court to continue the trial. The report of the Forensic Institute was announced in court, stating that the drug tested on January 11, 1932, contained opium, and the drug tested on March 13 contained suspected noscapine. The drugs purchased by the police could not be proven to contain toxic substances. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that according to the testing results, the defendant should not be guilty. Please let the court to decide freely. However, there is no doubt that the defendant violated the regulations on prepared drugs. The defendant submitted two photos of certificates from the Health Testing Institute proving that his drugs did not contain toxins, but he could not produce the originals, which showed that he had the suspicion of destroying evidence. The police should investigate and prosecute him in another case. After the defendant's lawyer defended Shi, Judge Qian declared in court that Shi Yuanlong was not guilty, and the violation part was sent to the violation court for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Using the Name of Imparting Culture, Tan Tian Commits Fraud and Obtains Money, Wang Yu Yuan, Manager of Hankou Da Shu Book Company, Files Prosecution, Defendant on the Run, Waiting for Arrest and Trial <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Tan Tian, a bookseller from Anhui, raised funds in October of the year before last to open a book and newspaper cooperative in Wangping Street, publishing various books. He had previously been involved in lawsuits and entanglements over the book (New Yuan History) with the descendants of Ke Shaoqi, the author of the book, and the Kaiming Bookstore, which printed the Twenty-Five Histories. Recently, Wang Yu Yuan, the manager of Da Shu Book Company on Jiaotong Road in Hankou, who is from Shaoxing, commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division against Tan Tian for pre-selling books with the intention of fraud, requesting legal action and including a civil suit, requesting a judgment to return the book payment of 1,584 yuan and 6 jiao. The essence of the self-suit states that the defendant Tan Tian opened a book and newspaper cooperative, compiling and printing books such as Twenty-Six Histories, Dietary Goods of Past Dynasties, Foreign Official Chronicles, New Yuan History, Qing History Biographies, etc., publishing advertisements in newspapers and issuing pre-sale book coupons. The self-litigant was entrusted to sell on commission, and successively set the price for Sixty-Six copies of the Twenty-Six Histories, Twenty-Seven copies of the New Yuan History, Twenty-Five copies of the Qing History Biographies, and one copy each of Dietary Goods of Past Dynasties, totaling 1,584 yuan and 6 jiao in book money. Between the winter of 1934 and January and February of the following year, the book payment was remitted to Tan Tian in succession, with receipt as proof. According to the pre-sale catalog of the cooperative, the Twenty-Six Histories would first publish five types, such as the Records of the Grand Historian, the History of the Han, and the History of the Jin. The remaining fifteen types, such as the Five Dynasties, Liao, Jin, Song History New Compilation, Yuan History New Compilation, and Twenty-Six History Research, would be published and delivered to the subscribers by the end of 1935. However, Tan Tian received the book payment but failed to publish the pre-sold books by the due date, nor did he return the book payment. Using delaying tactics until about October of last year, the cooperative closed down. In order to shirk responsibility, a temporary communication office was set up at 8 Songshan Road. The self-litigant was urged by customers who had pre-ordered the books and found it difficult to cope. However, the defendant Tan Tian, in the name of imparting culture, engaged in fraudulent means, which constituted the crime of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. The court is requested to detain him for punishment and order him to return the full amount of book money paid by the self-litigant. Upon receiving the petition, Judge Qiu Huanying went to the Second Criminal Division at 9:00 AM yesterday to summon the defendant. Only Xi Xiangguan, the agent lawyer of the self-litigant Wang Yu Yuan, appeared in court. After explaining the case, Judge Qiu said that it was impossible to summon the defendant Tan Tian, so he ordered that the case be tried again after the defendant was arrested.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>It has been a year since the last general meeting of shareholders. I still remember that the last business report briefly mentioned the bank's efforts to improve and plan for economic recovery. Now, as time passes, reviewing the work achievements and reforms implemented in the past year, we have been gradually advancing according to the established direction. However, due to the difficult times, we have not been able to fully achieve our expectations. In this year, international financial policies have become more turbulent, and changes in the domestic financial system have become a record in China's economic history. At this time, the bank realizes the importance of its mission and can only strive to adjust finance and develop industries, hoping to contribute to the cause and live up to the expectations of the government and society. All measures are based on the original intention of striving for stability, so as not to lose prudence in the midst of courageous progress. This is something that can be gratifying to our shareholders. Now, a summary of the domestic and international economic situation, a brief description of the bank's business development, and the direction of future efforts are listed for your consideration.</p>
<p>1.  Overview of Domestic and International Economy</p>
<p>In recent years, the domestic economy has remained depressed, and financial business has remained difficult to develop. All these facts show that we cannot satisfy our long-held expectations. Even if we look at the foreign economy, the special development of military industries and the increase in economic indexes, the currency competition between gold standard and non-gold standard countries is as antagonistic as in the previous year. The continued concentration of world gold and silver in the United States has become even more pronounced. Therefore, the economic policies of various countries almost all focus on the improvement of the monetary system. China has also taken the relief of industry and commerce and the implementation of legal tender as the central work of the whole year. Let's discuss it separately.</p>
<p>A. International Economy</p>
<p>In the past year, the international economic situation has shown slight improvement. Indexes such as production, consumption, and prices in various countries have increased, but the progress of international trade is still slow. Methods such as controlling industries and raising tariffs continue to be implemented, and currency wars are becoming more and more intense. Looking at the international situation, it is likely to move towards managed currency and stable currency values. First, let's talk about the United States.</p>
<p>Last year, the United States passed the Silver Purchase Act, stipulating that gold and silver reserves must meet a ratio of three to one, or raise the silver price to the coinage parity of one dollar and twenty-nine cents per ounce. This year, this plan is still in progress. The price of silver continues to rise from five corners four minutes eight seven five. In April, the US government decided to raise the price of silver twice within a month, first to seven corners one minute and then to seven corners seven minutes five seven. With speculators taking the opportunity to buy, it rose to a peak of eight corners one minute. Silver flowed out of various countries, leading Italy and Mexico to ban silver exports, and Mexico even declared silver nationalized. The gold standard group also had difficulty maintaining its position. In view of this situation, the US government had to slightly ease the situation, even though it still had to purchase 140 million yuan of silver according to its plan. In May, it ordered the ban on the import of foreign silver coins and changed its silver purchase method. The price of silver began to decline and finally saw a low price of four corners nine minutes seven five at the end of the year. In total, the United States purchased 543.8 million ounces of silver within a year, nearly doubling the amount of the previous year.</p>
<p>The silver purchase situation in the United States is as described above. As for the United Kingdom in the gold pound group, it still follows the policy adopted when it abandoned the gold standard in 1931 and continues to depreciate the currency. At the end of the year, the exchange rate of the gold pound against the French franc has fallen by more than 40%.</p>
<p>As for other European countries that maintained the gold standard, they generally encountered extremely serious financial panic during the year and adopted currency tightening policies one after another. However, due to the depressed domestic economy and sluggish export trade, although they restricted the import of foreign goods in many ways, funds still inevitably flowed out. In addition, at the beginning of the year, a coup occurred in France, and the situation in Italy and Austria became increasingly tense. The European situation became more and more unstable, and funds from France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland fled. In March, Belgium had to reduce the parity of the Belgian currency by 28% to save it. The Dutch currency was even more shaken. Affected by this, the French franc was also difficult to maintain. Although the interest rate was raised again and again, it still had no effect. Fortunately, with the unified assistance of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Bank for International Settlements, it returned to calm. However, in March, April, May and June, its gold reserves decreased by 11,618,000,000 French francs. The serious situation can be generally seen.</p>
<p>The prosperity of the international community is tied to the development of its trade, and a stable exchange rate is the only way to develop international trade. The financial turmoil in various countries is extremely detrimental to economic recovery. Therefore, in May of this year, the US State Department declared that the stability of international currency is an important part of the US foreign trade plan. At the same time, its Congress had a proposal to authorize the President to convene an international conference. The International Chamber of Commerce held in Paris in June also passed a resolution advising countries to strive for international exchange rate stability. In July, the American banker Morgan went to London again and met with the British Prime Minister to jointly stabilize the exchange rate. If all these plans can be realized, it will not only be the key to the world's prosperity, but also the benefit of China's economy.</p>
<p>B. Domestic Economy</p>
<p>In the first half of the year, the domestic economy was still affected by the US silver purchase, and the loss of floods in various places exacerbated the economic panic. Production sharply decreased, prices fell miserably, and agricultural exports also declined. The outflow of silver was still difficult to stop, and the contraction of currency and the shortage of tax revenue not only made industry and commerce increasingly depressed, but also made the silver and money industry feel difficult to cope with.</p>
<p>The government, in view of this, deeply knows that the remedy cannot be delayed. In February, it promulgated measures to encourage the re-import of silver, and in April, it signed an agreement with foreign banks to stop the export of silver. The situation was eased. Unexpectedly, in early April, two Shanghai foreign exchange trading houses successively closed down, and the market situation suddenly felt tense. The turnover of the money industry fell into exhaustion again. With the relief of the Traffic Bank, the Central Bank, and the Bank of China, it was barely maintained. By May, deposit withdrawals occurred in Qingdao and other places. Many silver and money industries in Shanghai, Tianjin, Ningbo, and Guangzhou also suspended business and reorganized. The government allocated 25 million yuan of financial bonds, which were received by the Money Industry Supervision Committee and reorganized into a syndicate loan committee to handle loans. In addition, 20 million yuan of national treasury securities were allocated to establish an industry and commerce loan committee to implement relief separately. The crisis was safely passed. After the end of May, the market situation was still slightly loosened, and the "Hua Tou Jia Shui" (premium for silver dollars) always hovered at the highest peak of seven corners. All parties, in view of the difficult situation, deeply knew that the improvement of the credit system could not be delayed, and that stabilizing hearts and minds would be impossible without flattening the Hua Tou Jia Shui. Therefore, the Traffic Bank and the Bank of China expressed their willingness to adjust as much as possible for the banks and trading houses that needed Hua Tou. The silver and money industries association agreed that the Traffic Bank and the Bank of China would be the central exchange for foreign exchange instruments. Therefore, trading houses lacking silver dollars could borrow Hua Tou from the national treasury with collateral, and the Hua Tou Jia Shui gradually eased. At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce and the banking industry also promoted the acceptance of bills of exchange, and the market situation gradually became active.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned measures are still a temporary solution. On November 3, the government promulgated emergency decrees to reform the currency system, stipulating that the banknotes issued by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Traffic Bank are legal tender, and established a Currency Issuance Reserve Management Committee to unify issuance and centralize reserves. All holders of silver coins and silver should exchange them for legal tender. The central banks, the Bank of China, and the Traffic Bank conducted unlimited trading of foreign exchange, which went smoothly. Many foreign banks in Shanghai also expressed their willingness to cooperate. The Currency Issuance Reserve Management Committee was established on November 5. All issuance reserves of banks that have stopped issuing banknotes, as well as banknotes that have been printed but not issued, and those that have been issued and recovered, were designated to be received separately by the Traffic Bank, the Central Bank, and the Bank of China, and to exchange local silver.</p>
<p>This new monetary system is the beginning of the government's overall plan to improve finance and economy. The first effect is to stabilize the external exchange rate. Then, prices will gradually rise. The foreign exchange market price has not changed at all until the end of the year. In terms of prices, Shanghai wholesale prices in December increased by 13.4% compared to September, export prices increased by 19.4%, and import prices increased by 17.2%. The impact of this price increase on import and export trade can be seen from the import and export trade balance in the three months of winter. In October, the trade deficit was 12,776,023 yuan. In November, it decreased to 12,203,141 yuan. However, some of the goods were ordered before November. In December, it turned into a trade surplus of 5,351,427 yuan. From then on, efforts to improve the domestic economy may continue to improve.</p>
<p>Looking at the domestic and international economic situation as a whole, it is complicated and intricate, and it is not limited to the above. The stability of the international exchange market and the balance of world trade are the key elements for the recovery of the world economy. The foundation for the recovery of prosperity in China's economic circles and the development of various businesses in the banking industry will also be seen from this.</p>
<p>2.  Business Situation</p>
<p>The bank is a bank for developing national industries. In terms of its mission, it has the responsibility to maintain and regulate various industries. In terms of the entire financial system, it also takes mutual assistance and cooperation as the principle with its peers. The seriousness of the domestic economic situation in the past year has been described above. The financial industries are in urgent need of relief and support. The expectations of the bank are also increasing. It is difficult to cope with the difficulties and heavy responsibilities. Therefore, on the one hand, it absorbs idle funds to strengthen its strength, and on the other hand, it chooses the urgent matters and carries out operations in different ways. Although it feels difficult to achieve, there are still visible results. Now, the business situation of this year is described separately.</p>
<p>(1) Deposits: The total balance of the bank's deposits in the 24th year of the Republic of China was over 33,147,400 yuan, an increase of over 89,427,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 118,482,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. The balance of fixed deposits was over 76,200,000 yuan, an increase of over 10,900,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 23,065,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. The balance of current deposits was over 244,030,000 yuan, an increase of over 72,744,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 85,425,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. The balance of bank drafts and miscellaneous deposits was over 11,244,000 yuan, an increase of over 5,781,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 9,991,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. According to the bank's historical deposits, they have always increased without decreasing. The increase in this year is even greater. The reason is that the market is depressed, and there are many financial accidents, so deposits have a natural trend of concentration. However, it is also due to the bank's efforts to serve the society. The analysis of the increase in various deposits shows that current deposits are still the most, followed by fixed deposits, and bank drafts and miscellaneous deposits are the least. Among the current deposits, those that can be paid and received with passbooks have increased the most. The increase in fixed deposits shows a good phenomenon of the development of public savings. Analyzing and comparing the figures in each district, the increase in the Shanghai district accounts for nearly two-thirds of the total. Other districts such as Zhejiang, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Hankou, and Zhengzhou also have excellent results. However, the two districts of Northeast Changchun and Shenyang failed to make as much progress as possible due to the complex local currency system and financial situation. The Tianjin district also failed to make as much progress as possible due to environmental reasons. Otherwise, the overall increase would be more than this.</p>
<p>(2) Remittances: The total amount of remittances from the bank in the 24th year was over 457,049,000 yuan, an increase of over 166,007,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 246,425,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. The total amount of purchased drafts was over 293,318,000 yuan, an increase of over 115,641,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 187,098,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. This is a significant improvement. The bank has always paid attention to communicating remittances to assist the flow of industrial and American finance. This year, branches have continued to add remittance locations, expand distribution, and strive for simple procedures and convenience for customers. Since the currency system changed, remittances from various places have been uniformly exempted from water and transfer, and the turnover has become more flexible, resulting in the expected results.</p>
<p>The only districts where remittances and purchased drafts decreased this year were Changchun and Zhejiang. The reason is that the Changchun district was affected by the local management of remittances and the transfer of funds, and the Zhejiang district was due to the turmoil in the money industry in Ningbo, which led to a reduction in the outflow of funds. However, the total number of reductions in the two districts is not as much as one-tenth of the increase in the Shanghai district. Other districts such as Hong Kong, Xiamen, Tianjin, Jinan, Hankou, and Zhengzhou also have a large increase, which shows a glimpse of the remittance business in this year.</p>
<p>(3) Loans and Investments: The total balance of the bank's loans and investments in the 24th year was over 254,678,000 yuan, an increase of over 39,786,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 75,578,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. The balance of fixed loans was over 63,695,000 yuan, which is the same as the previous two years. The balance of current loans was over 150,288,000 yuan, which is an increase of over 29,329,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 52,471,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. The balance of discounted loans was over 5,942,000 yuan, which is the same as the 23rd year and an increase of over 3,524,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. The balance of valuable securities was over 34,751,000 yuan, an increase of over 11,380,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 8,600,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. Excluding valuable securities, the total balance of the three loans, fixed-term, current-term and discounted, this year was over 219,925,000 yuan, compared with the total balance of 191,520,000 yuan in the 23rd year, an increase of 28,400,000 yuan. Analyzing its increased content, commodity and factory mortgage loans are still the most, followed by security mortgage loans, and then by loans to institutions and groups. The bank has always emphasized credit on goods in its loan methods. In addition to adding warehouses and directly doing commodity mortgages, it also pays attention to industrial and agricultural loans. Therefore, the number of commodity mortgage loans has increased the most, and factory mortgage loans have also achieved success. The following is a list of the investment amounts of various commodity mortgages, mortgage financing and investments this year.</p>
<p>From the above observation, the investment in various commodities this year is not only considerable in amount, but also evenly distributed. In the future, if the environment permits, it will continue to seek development in this area. The reason why the security mortgage loan has increased more is that the government has actively carried out various construction projects this year and issued public bonds, which were borne and mortgaged by the bank more. In order to maintain national credit and assist colleagues in regulating the market, bond mortgage arbitrage has also been done. The bank, with its position and mission, has made inevitable investments. In addition, since the change of the currency system, loans to various provinces to maintain financial lending have been spread out by several million yuan, so institutional loans have also increased considerably. As for valuable securities, since the increase in capital was resolved at the last general meeting of shareholders, the government allocated 11 million yuan of financial public bond par value in the 24th year to offset the official share item. The new and unpaid capital was actually invested with an increase of over 2,380,000 yuan, in addition to transferring 2 million yuan to the savings department as an increase in funds. In general, the bank's loans and investments this year do not favor any aspect. All those that can help production and improve finance will do their best according to their needs.</p>
<p>(4) Profit and Loss: The net profit of the bank in the 24th year was over 1,290,900 yuan, an increase of over 383,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 290,500 yuan compared to the 22nd year. Analyzing its content, interest and handling fees are still the main source of profit. The total revenue of profits was over 6,331,000 yuan, an increase of over 1,170,500 yuan compared to the previous year. As for the loss items, various expenses have increased slightly with the development of business, totaling over 3,619,000 yuan. Real estate and wealth were still allocated and withdrawn according to past precedents, totaling over 963,000 yuan. In addition, bad debts totaled over 137,000 yuan, and issuance tax totaled over 320,900 yuan. The total payment of losses was over 5,040,900 yuan. The net profit was over 1,290,900 yuan after offsetting profit and loss. This is the general situation of profit and loss this year.</p>
<p>3.  Issuance and Preparation Situation</p>
<p>At the end of the 24th year, the total amount of banknotes in circulation in the bank, excluding nominal banknotes from Liaoning and Harbin and other old banknotes that were only received but not issued, was 180,825,650 yuan, an increase of 77,590,800 yuan compared with the total amount of banknotes in circulation at the end of the 23rd year. In terms of reserve funds, the cash reserve fund was 117,621,833 yuan, accounting for over 65% of the circulation amount. The guarantee reserve fund was 63,200,317 yuan, accounting for less than 35% of the circulation amount. In terms of the issuance situation throughout the year, although the off-season months of February, March, April, and May also saw a decline as in previous years, they were slightly higher than the same months in the 23rd year. After June, it gradually increased. By the end of October, it was equal to the highest amount at the end of the previous year. After the implementation of the new currency system in November, the amount of banknotes in circulation in the bank increased even more after being designated as legal tender.</p>
<p>4.  Business Situation of the Savings Department</p>
<p>(1) Savings and Investments: The savings department of the bank originally had a fund of 500,000 yuan. This year, in order to expand the savings business, it increased the fund by 2 million yuan, for a total of 2.5 million yuan. The total balance of savings deposits was over 46,083,000 yuan, an increase of over 16,055,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 27,663,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. Among them, fixed savings deposits accounted for 63.9% of the total, and current savings deposits accounted for 36%. Compared with previous years, both fixed and current deposits have increased. However, the four northeastern provinces have stopped receiving new savings deposits due to environmental reasons, so the savings deposits in that area have been declining. Otherwise, the overall increase would be more than this. As for the use of savings deposits, the principle is still to strive for stability and comply with the Savings Bank Law. In total, the amount of loans and investments this year was over 19,450,000 yuan, excluding current deposits and loans, an increase of over 9,339,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 13,004,000 yuan compared to the 22nd year. The purchase of security bonds totaled over 12,451,000 yuan, which has exceeded one-quarter of the statutory savings total, an increase of over 6,512,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year. Mortgage loans totaled over 6,999,000 yuan, an increase of over 2,826,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year. Among them, real estate mortgage loans accounted for 18.7% of the total, security mortgage loans accounted for 57.5% of the total, and deposit certificate and passbook mortgage loans accounted for 23.8% of the total. This is the general situation.</p>
<p>(2) Profit and Loss: The net profit of the savings department of the bank in the 24th year was over 110,800 yuan, an increase of over 24,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year and an increase of over 30,400 yuan compared to the 22nd year. It is proposed to continue to roll over under the public accumulation item according to the precedents of previous years in order to increase the foundation. This is the general situation of profit and loss this year.</p>
<p>5.  Rowing Affairs and Work Situation</p>
<p>Regarding the reform of rowing affairs and various tasks, this year we have made every effort to advance according to the established policy. The important ones are described below.</p>
<p>(1) Capital Increase and Reorganization: In March of this year, the government issued 100 million yuan of financial public bonds for the purpose of adjusting finance and maintaining industry and commerce, which were allocated to the bank, the Central Bank, and the Bank of China to increase share capital and other purposes. The bank was approved to revise the Traffic Bank Regulations according to the government order, and the total amount of the bank's share capital was changed to 20 million yuan of national currency, expanding the official share to 12 million yuan. The official share recognized by the government in the 17th year was also fully allocated with financial public bonds. All dividends, share rights, and director and supervisor quotas were revised. The bank was still granted a special license by the government to be a bank for developing national industries, and the types of business did not change significantly. It was still entrusted by the government to handle various affairs, and it could also be entrusted by the Central Bank to handle them. The bank's responsibilities were therefore more important, and its capital was doubled. As for the revised bank's articles of association, the shareholders' general meeting had already resolved and passed them in the previous session, and then they were submitted to the Ministry of Finance for revision, approval, and record.</p>
<p>(2) Adding Institutions: The bank's promotion of business in recent years has been based on assisting industry and balancing finance in urban and inland areas. The expansion of the business network is mainly along the coastline and the Longhai Line. The implementation situation has been detailed in the previous year's business report. This year's business is still based on the original policy and is working hard. The business institutions in Qin, Jin, Bian, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong have been continuously developed or adjusted. The branches and departments in Northeast China have also been reorganized separately or directly revoked in order to adapt to the times. Therefore, although the number of new branches, offices, and warehouses opened by the bank this year has increased to more than 30, the total number of existing branches and institutions has not far exceeded that of previous years. The increase or decrease of institutions is related to the expenses of the whole bank. It is necessary to pay equal attention to increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. The number of warehouses continued to increase this year. The newly opened ones include Hanyang, Changsha, Ningbo, Wuxi, Huangqiao, Qingjiangpu, Bengbu, and Suiyuan. Others are also under construction and preparation.</p>
<p>(3) Building Bank Houses and Warehouses: The modern economic environment is changing rapidly. Bank business houses and warehouses for storing mortgaged goods cannot be fully applied to leased houses. In addition to the new houses that the banks in Hankou, Harbin, Dalian, Yantai, etc. had built themselves, the houses of the Nanjing and Changshu branches and the Shanghai warehouse were also newly built and completed in the previous year. The bank houses under construction this year include four places, Zhenjiang, Changsha, Xuzhou, and Gulangyu. There are also five warehouses in Bengbu, Changsha, Ningbo, Xi'an, and Weinan. More than half of the construction has been completed, and there are more than one or two bases that have been purchased and are waiting for design and construction. In short, the construction of houses and the advancement of business are closely related and cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>(4) Assisting Industries: This year, from spring to autumn, domestic industries have been impacted by international financial policies and rural disasters. The dynamics of the industrial sector have gradually become active since the currency reform in early November. However, the purchasing power of the people has not increased, and the industry and commerce themselves still need to be enriched. All these situations have been described above. The bank's mission is to develop industries, and it should have appropriate assistance in this environment. In the past year, the bank has cooperated in the planned improvement of silkworms, the preparation and control of fisheries, and the regional management of agricultural loans. Among them, special attention has been paid to the expansion of export businesses. As for the industrial and commercial aspects, such as textile factories, flour factories, and chemical factories, if their business can be expected to advance, but they lack working capital and cannot expand their effectiveness, they will be given loans to facilitate turnover. For those with a large scope and large needs, who need to plan as a whole to be able to operate and promote, we will assist in the design to make them come up with a reasonable plan or issue corporate bonds entrusted by the bank to promote their ability to regenerate and complete the bank's mission of assisting and regulating. In terms of the bank's business policy, it is based on conservatism and seeks the safety of operations. In view of the fact that various industries in China are mostly emerging, and the operating efficiency may not be as expected, the bank also appoints staff to check at any time during the loan period, so as to seek to improve its efficiency in the regulation of the economy. This is not only to seek meticulous investment, but also the bank's high expectations for industry and commerce.</p>
<p>(5) Promoting Construction Projects: In recent years, the government has been bravely advancing construction projects. All the construction of railways and highways, the dredging of water conservancy dikes, etc., have been far-sighted and actively carried out. All the measures are the foundation for the restoration and economic foundation, and the bank has a long-standing relationship in its historical mission. In the past year, the bank has done its best to assist in the liaison of the Jiangnan Railway and the Jingwu Line, the extension of the West-Bao section of the Longhai Railway, the paving of the Xiangqian Highway, the dredging of the Huai River Project and the Yellow River Water Conservancy, etc., which the bank believes can improve people's livelihood and develop production. As for the projects that have not been completed before, such as the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge, the opening of the Weihe Diversion Canal, and the development of the Huainan Railway Coal Mine, etc., we will continue to assist according to the original proposal. Construction projects and the development of industries are closely related, and the bank's mission is to help.</p>
<p>(6) Regulating the Market: The state of the tense market situation after the start of the year has been described earlier. The bank, in view of the fact that the Shanghai financial market is the lifeline of the country and cannot be ignored, jointly made loans with the Central Bank and the Bank of China to various trading houses to facilitate turnover, and purchased silver from Hong Kong and London to help alleviate the temporary panic in the market. When the market was tight again in the summer, the government took emergency relief measures, and the bank also joined colleagues to form a syndicate to carry out lending, and jointly with the Bank of China to serve as the central exchange for foreign exchange instruments, and tried its best to adjust for various trading houses to barely survive the crisis. Starting in August, the bank and its colleagues jointly organized industrial and commercial loans for more general regulation. All these are only temporary measures to adapt to the environment, but at the time of extremely tight money, the room for maneuver was effective. After the implementation of the new currency system, the bank's banknotes were designated as legal tender, and the society had higher expectations for the bank. The bank also followed the government's policy and weighed the surplus and deficit of local market conditions at any time, and gave adjustments to help the implementation of the currency system and establish a solid foundation.</p>
<p>(7) Expanding Trust Business: The bank's trust business has previously handled service-oriented businesses such as custody of securities, agency insurance, and property management. This year, in view of the increasing need for trust business in society and the important relationship between trust business and the bank's special mission of developing industries, the bank has specially formulated trust regulations and submitted them to the ministry for record. The trust fund is also intended to be allocated separately and operated independently to ensure security. The rules for various trust businesses have also been formulated separately with reference to the systems of various countries, and the implementation will be decided on a case-by-case basis depending on the needs of the location of each branch.</p>
<p>(8) Personnel Improvement: Since the bank's business has gradually developed, all personnel facilities must be improved to increase efficiency. This year, the policy on personnel measures, in addition to continuing to use the examination system for recruiting personnel, and strictly screening the existing employees, also separately formulated retirement measures. The special attention is paid to: (1) accounting training. All the special probationary employees recruited last year and the original employees who still lack sufficient experience in accounting affairs will be placed in a specially established accounting training class. All accounting affairs, from vouchers to final accounts, will be guided item by item to become familiar with them. After the training period expires, they will be sent to branches for practice so that they can become proficient in practical techniques. (2) Factory internships. The bank believes that factory loans should first understand the content of the factory. Therefore, when selecting graduates from various universities as special probationary employees last year, it has paid attention to the cultivation of specialized academics. This year, it has taken a further step to specially select and send special probationary employees to cement, paper, acid, and textile factories to investigate the machinery and equipment, manufacturing costs, and product sales of each factory. It is important to pay attention to on-site practice. It has now been completed one after another, and these special probationary employees will be assigned to various positions. (3) Enriching library facilities. Modern bank employees, in addition to the corresponding skills, also rely on peacetime cultivation to enrich their knowledge. For special affairs, it is indispensable to have various books for reference. The bank's library facilities are based on this purpose. This year, it has continued to add to the storage of books, which are classified and stored according to the new classification method. From now on, it will not be difficult to become a great view over the years.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are of great importance to the development of the bank's business. Now that they have been implemented in order, the results can be expected. However, the economic business is changing with each passing day, and the bank's business must seek to advance with the times. The achievements in the past period should not be self-painted by the bank.</p>
<p>6.  Future Efforts</p>
<p>The reason why the domestic economic business is declining is that, in short, there are only two reasons: financial tightness and stagnation of production and sales. Therefore, if we want to assist agriculture, industry, and commerce to restore their purpose today, it lies in cultivating the production function. The means are tied to the turnover of finance in various industries. The methods of turning over finance in various industries, those related to direct action are the lending of funds, such as agricultural, industrial, and commercial loans. Those related to indirect action are the promotion of business, such as increasing business institutions and goods warehouses. Although the two methods are different, the promotion of business is nothing more than the use of funds to facilitate the promotion of agriculture, industry, and commerce. The bank's past business and work situation have paid attention to the above two points. The direction of future efforts is also here. Let's analyze it.</p>
<p>(1) Pay attention to remortgaging to regulate the market and finance. Mortgage is a method of financing funds, which is slightly similar to discounting, but the term is different. Discounted bills are shorter in term and must be supported by rediscounting. Mortgage loans are longer in term and must be remortgaged to finance their turnover. The so-called remortgaging means that one party's mortgage debt is remortgaged to the other party. Today, the biggest difficulty in the economic circle is the stagnation of book debt, and the resources that can help each other are very limited. Now, if we want to make full use of this limited mutual assistance resources to avoid the stagnation of book mortgage debt, in addition to discounting, we have to organize remortgaging according to the method of rediscounting to fill the credit market and promote financial turnover. This is the first point.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to corporate bonds to support the cow production business. The advantage of remortgaging to industrial and commercial finance is as described above. A further step is the fundraising of corporate bonds, which is the main way to enlighten social enterprise investment. The bank's revised regulations originally stipulated that the management, subscription, or acceptance of corporate bonds should be one of the business operations. There are more than one or two who are now agreeing to undertake the operation. In the future, we should further promote it according to the needs of the society to promote social enterprise investment. However, the bank's investment should be limited to production businesses. We should still study the organization, management, equipment, and cost of the company in detail to ensure that the investment is not in vain and the matter is practical, and the purpose of assisting production is completed. This is the second point.</p>
<p>(3) Support exporters to adjust foreign trade.</p>
<p>The above two points mainly focus on the circulation of finance to help the production and sales of goods. However, the effectiveness of financial circulation must be sought to circulate domestically without flowing out to foreign countries. Therefore, supporting the production and sales of goods should focus on domestic agricultural and industrial products. For export commodities such as silk and cotton, tea, and mineral products, we should use various methods to help promote them so that export trade can be smoothly transferred and production and sales businesses can be increased accordingly.

<p>The 9th Jiaotong University Men's Volleyball Championship opened yesterday at 3:00 PM at Guanghua and Chizhi Schools, respectively. (The women's division was cancelled this year.) Participating schools include Fudan, Jinan, Chizhi, and Guanghua. Compared to the era of the eight major universities in the Jiangnan region in previous years, the feeling is quite different. The results of yesterday's two matches are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Fudan Defeats Chizhi <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The first set of the match between Fudan and Chizhi was held at the Guangdong East Middle School Gymnasium yesterday at 3:00 PM. After the start of the match, Fudan took the lead, with Zhou Dayun soaring high and scoring five points in a row. Chizhi was unwilling to fall behind, and Zhang Jiayi scored a point. However, Fudan's momentum remained strong, with Qiu Guangxie and Zhou Jiemin scoring repeatedly, one smashing and one spiking. At this point, Chizhi suffered a setback. Fudan won the first set 21-3.</p>
<p>Second set: Chizhi's Yu Wenquan served, immediately scoring a point. Wang Chen added icing on the cake, also achieving remarkable feats. Fudan quickly took an 8-4 lead. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, all of Chizhi's players calmly responded to the challenge. Mai Zhihong and Wang Yufu rose together, their momentum flourishing, and they tied the score at 8-8. Afterwards, the game tied again several times. When Fudan took the lead at 20-19, Chen Zongqi added another point, winning the set 21-19.</p>
<p>Third set: Fudan won two consecutive sets, their morale soaring. When the front line seized Chizhi's incoming ball, Zhou Dayun immediately seized the opportunity to score a point. Chizhi's Zhang Jiayi was unwilling to show weakness, leaping forward on the front line and striking a blow, immediately retaliating. However, Fudan did not diminish its courage and remained aggressive. The score soared like a blue cloud, and after three rounds, they were already leading by 18-13. Zhou Dayun added three points, winning again with a score of 21-13. In total, Chizhi suffered a disastrous defeat with a score of 3-0.</p>

<p>Guanghua Dominates: The match between Jinan and Guanghua was held at Guanghua yesterday, starting at 3:30 PM. The strength of the two teams was evenly matched. Guanghua's front and middle rows were extremely sharp in smashing, but the back row was weaker. Jinan's ability to save dangerous balls in the back row was truly miraculous. After the start of the match, Jinan scored two points first with a serve, then advanced to 4-1. Guanghua caught up step by step and tied the score. Afterwards, each side made progress, but only by one or two points. Soon, Guanghua took the lead with 11-9 and gained the right to switch sides first. At 12-10, Jinan surpassed them with 15-12. Guanghua then fought calmly, from 17-17 to 20-20. Finally, Guanghua scored two points in a row and won the first set 22-20. In the second set, Guanghua again led with 5-1, giving Jinan a huge blow. Xuan Yaoji's serve turned the tide, and Jinan surpassed them with 6-5, and took the right to switch sides first with 11-10. Jinan's host saw that Guanghua's momentum was strong and urgently called in captain Yuan Zejian to replace Rong Yaoji. Unexpectedly, this change was met with oppression from Guanghua, until 18-18, Guanghua won the second set with 21-18.</p>
<p>Jinan Triumphs: Jinan lost two consecutive sets. The third set was a critical juncture. Li Yaoji was again called up to replace Liu Boxi, and the morale soared, leading with 6-1. However, Guanghua was not weak either, approaching step by step. The two sides rescued dangerous balls with great brilliance. Jinan used all their might and finally won a set with 21-11. In the fourth set, Guanghua took the lead with 7-2. Fortunately, Jinan's back row provided strong support, scoring eight points in a row, surpassing them with 10-7. Guanghua saw that the situation was not good and urgently called up new forces to enter the game. At this time, the situation was in a storm. When Guanghua took the lead with 17-15, the situation changed again. However, Jinan's ball delivery was fast and powerful, and they quickly won a set with 21-17. At this time, a 2-2 situation was formed. In the fifth set, Guanghua worked hard to capture it. Tang Zhiwei scored five points in a row with a serve, causing Jinan to lose their color. Yuan Zejian had superb skills and fought hard, one point after another, catching up to 4-4 and then 6-6. Then, they reached 10-10. After the side exchange, Jinan Father Ti Zeng added 14 points, and Guanghua began to panic. After that, Jinan became smoother, ending the set with 21-14 in an instant. Jinan won three sets in a row, turning defeat into victory with 3-2. The lineup and results are recorded below.</p>

<p>After the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided to relocate the Provincial Nanjing Middle School to Zhenjiang, local figures from Nanjing's commercial and academic circles, including Liu Jingsheng, repeatedly petitioned the Executive Yuan Ministry of Education to advocate for its retention.

<h3 id="e148">Lei Zhen Speaks on "Nation and Culture" <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM on the 24th, the Nanjing branch of the China Cultural Construction Association invited Central Committee member Lei Zhen to deliver a speech titled "Nation and Culture" at the Central Broadcasting Station. The following is a transcript of his original words: "For a group to become a nation, it must possess unique natural attributes and culture. This is an undeniable conclusion. Today, when one speaks of a nation, it seems like a self-evident concept, but if one were to ask what exactly a nation is, diverse opinions abound and are difficult to reconcile.</p>
<p>From a natural perspective, blood lineage and territory are important factors in the formation of a nation. However, the so-called nation today, no matter how much heterogeneity is mixed and unified within it, a nation of pure blood is practically nonexistent today. The same goes for territory. The people of China and England are scattered all over the world, yet their national character has not disappeared. A nation that resides in only one place is now an exception. Due to the limitations of the topic, the factors of race and territory cannot be discussed in detail; only the relationship between nation and culture will be addressed. Moreover, with the progress of modern transportation and frequent human interaction, blood lineage and territory are no longer crucial conditions for studying national characteristics. Culture is the key factor that represents the characteristics of a nation. The definition of a nation given by Bluntschli is: 'A nation is a union of a multitude of people belonging to a particular race who are bound together by a community of spirit and feeling evoked by language and customs, social systems with various professions and social classes, and who have a shared civilization. This civilization sets aside the ties of the state and gives them a unified concept, making them feel distinct from people of other countries.'</p>
<p>Among the elements of culture, sciences, technology, economics, and other aspects related to reason have universal qualities and a weaker connection to the nation. A nation can certainly be proud of its intellectual superiority over other nations, but this does not necessarily increase love for one's own nation. A nation with lower knowledge not only does not despise itself because of this but also often has a stronger solidarity than a nation with higher knowledge. The reason for this is quite evident.</p>
<p>In primitive times, religion held enormous power. Therefore, religious rituals and creeds often determined the factors of a nation. Totemic societies invariably revolved around religion, and it can be said that the nation was united only by religion. However, since the advent of civilization, with the expansion of politics, economics, and other forces, the power of religion has gradually diminished. Various European nations, all adherents of Christianity, have not been able to merge into one large nation because of this. Instead, due to the division of each nation, rifts have arisen within Christianity (initially dividing into Greek Orthodox and Roman Orthodox, and later into Protestant and Catholic). Since the Wei and Jin dynasties, the Chinese nation has not only juxtaposed Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, with emperors assigning them each a designation, allowing the people to freely practice their beliefs, but even bizarre and outlandish religions could coexist without conflict. The nation not only did not separate because of this but also expanded further and became more unified. Coming to the present day, the separation of nations based on differences in religious beliefs is limited to a few uncivilized nations.</p>
<p>Then, what is the most important factor determining a nation? A shared way of life in historical destiny, and the unity of language and script are the most important of these three. Now, without discussing their interplay, let's separate them into three aspects and examine them individually.</p>
<p>First, a shared historical destiny is the foundation for the formation of a nation. Because sharing weal and woe in history causes people belonging to this group to develop a consciousness of a common life. Thus, internally, it consolidates their unity, becoming a single unit, and externally, it uses its entire strength to contend with other nations. Bluntschli said, 'In our view, a nation is a soul, a spirit, that comes from remembering past sacrifices, glory, repeated prosperity, and shared sorrow. A spiritual family, in the present, comes from the desire to continue maintaining a shared life. The things that constitute a nation are neither because of speaking the same language nor because of belonging to the same racial group. It is due to having jointly accomplished great undertakings in the past and still desiring to accomplish great undertakings in the future. A nation is a spiritual principle that is the result of deep and complex historical circumstances.' Our ancestors, whether in culture or politics, built great achievements as a common bond for our nation. At the same time, since the beginning of history, we have also suffered many sorrows. In the same period, we were invaded by the Xiongnu and Quanrong. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, foreign interactions have become increasingly frequent. The greatest defeats were the Three Catastrophes: the Five Barbarians invasion of China and the rule of the Yuan and Qing dynasties. The first catastrophe caused China to split into North and South for nearly three hundred years. The second catastrophe led to national subjugation for over eighty years. The third catastrophe lasted for as long as two hundred and sixty years. However, although the duration differed, sharing weal and woe was undeniable.</p>
<p>School Survey</p>
<h3 id="e149">An Overview of the Shanghai German School (I) <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>The German community in Shanghai has established a German school. The school is located at No. 1 Da Xi Road in the western district of the International Settlement; it is large-scale and perfectly equipped. The author is grateful to Dr. Weber, the principal of the school, for providing various materials and for the gift of a commemorative publication and school overview.</p>
<p>1. The Oldest German School in the Far East</p>
<p>The Shanghai German School has been in operation for forty-one years. In the summer of 1894, a German missionary recruited about a dozen German children to teach in his home. Soon the number of students increased to about twenty; thus, preparations were made to open a school. After active progress, the oldest German school in the Far East was officially established on April 1, 1895. Initially, the school had only three teachers and twenty-three students; later, it gradually developed, and by 1900, the number of students had increased to more than forty. Soon, the German church began construction, and it was decided to build a school building behind the church; in the autumn of 1901, the school moved into its self-built school building and started classes.</p>
<p>A few years later, the school continued to develop, and the original school building was no longer sufficient. The old school's various facilities were not hygienic, there was no sports field, and students often played on the streets after class, which was inappropriate. In 1905, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany celebrated his silver jubilee, and the German community in Shanghai donated funds to celebrate. Considering the large number of German children in Shanghai who needed schooling but lacked modern school buildings, the Emperor decided to return the celebratory gifts donated by the German community to be used to purchase land in Shanghai for the purpose of building a new school building. Thus, in 1906, the German community in Shanghai purchased more than ten acres of land on Da Xi Road (the current school site) and decided to name the future new German school the Kaiser-Wilhelm School to commemorate the Emperor's kindness in donating the land.</p>
<p>Since then, the school has undergone various changes and developments; now, a few important facts are presented for narration. Previously, the school affairs were handled jointly with the church affairs, which both parties felt was inappropriate; in 1908, the school separated from the church, and the administration became completely independent. Later, after various difficulties and efforts, the new school building was officially completed on Da Xi Road on April 23, 1911. On that day, the entire German community in Shanghai came to the new school building to hold a celebration. In the same year, it was decided to add a kindergarten. At this time, the total number of students in the school had increased to more than one hundred. The European War broke out in 1914. In February 1922, the school began to return to normal.</p>
<p>In 1928, the German community believed that the original school building was no longer sufficient for the school's development, so it was decided to demolish the old school building and rebuild a large-scale new school building. In May 1929, the large-scale new school building was completed, and the foundation of the school could be considered solidified at that time. The school currently has one year of kindergarten, four years of elementary school, and nine years of secondary school. The school is currently recognized by the German government, and students can participate in the German national examination after graduating from secondary school. The school currently has 260 students, 140 boys and 120 girls; among them, 90 are non-German students who wish to study at the school. There are a total of 18 teachers in the school, including 14 full-time teachers and 4 part-time teachers. The purpose of the school is to enable the children of the German community in Shanghai to avoid the influence of foreign education and to provide them with an opportunity to absorb German science and knowledge so that they can become useful German citizens. The success of the school today demonstrates the strong will and continuous efforts of the German expatriate community; at the same time, in the international environment of Shanghai, the establishment of the school can also enhance Germany's international equality.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Gold Loan Interest at 4% <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Since our country implemented the legal tender policy, various interest rates have naturally followed suit and fallen. Currently, the foreign exchange swap difference is extremely small, but the gold loan swap still requires the sellers to post 4 to 5 yuan monthly. In the current period, some sellers have even posted 5.5 yuan, which amounts to a monthly interest rate of over 0.5%. Later, with the repeated efforts of the financial community to maintain stability, it began to stabilize. This was due to fourth quarter relationships (which caused a brief surge in seller activity). Recently, because the four major banks, including a certain bank, jointly posted spot and swaps in large quantities, the posted price has now dropped to around 4 yuan, with a monthly interest rate of less than 4% (gold loan price over 1100 yuan, swap at 4 yuan and 5 cents). However, sellers are still crowded, taking advantage of the low price to post, and the overall trend seems to be stabilizing. Tracing back to the original reasons, there are approximately four: 1. Abundant spot reserves, making it impossible for sellers to collect goods (which can be inferred from the chips in the gold exchange); 2. After the legal tender policy, there are more people in the industry with an upward mindset, leading to crowded long positions; 3. Spot goods frequently arrive in Shanghai to seek resale (most of the sellers recently posting are spot houses, and not general surplus long positions); 4. Among the Tianjin gangs, there are even many who swap spot gold for cash due to headquarter transfers; 5. Gold loan mortgages require 4.5% interest from foreign banks (still with discounts), and they also require an appropriate discount on the gold price. Generally, buyers must advance a portion of the cash. Because of this, although gold loan swaps exist, the financial community is rushing to arbitrage, and the posted price ultimately requires a monthly interest rate of around 4%.</p>

<h3 id="e154">If the Fourth Quarter is Prolonged, the Deposit Interest Rate is 5.5 Yuan, and the Lowest Overdue Interest Rate is 8 Yuan <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Every year in April and October, the financial community is busy with the settlement of long-term transactions as usual. This year, due to the continued sluggish market, lending is restricted and borrowing is hopeless. Although efforts are made on the surface to maintain stability and turn danger into safety, the actual hidden tightness is much greater than before. It is found that the total amount of the fourth quarter initial period (excluding those that have been settled) and the amount of deposits transferred by various depositors reached more than 23 million. The total amount of long-term overdue loans is more than 50 million, plus 13 to 14 million long-term Yongzhuang loans and more than 25 million long-term mortgages. The total settlement difference is more than 10 million. Currently, with the authorities' accommodation to transfer and settle interest without repaying the principal, they account for more than 80% to 90% of the total, and those who pay are actually less than 5 million. From this, one can see the dryness of the market. In addition, new long-term loans are very rare. Except for banks such as Zizhong, Guanghua, Daya, Huizhong, Zhonghe, Zhengming, Jiangzhe, and other banks that are members of the Bankers' Association, and qianzhuang such as Chengyu, Gengyu, Fuyuan, Fukang, Anyu, Ankang, Cunde, Duyu, Jintai, Tongyu, Shunkang, Wufeng, and Zifeng, who still release huge long-term loans, amounting to more than 10 million, other types only accept and do not release. Therefore, apart from the more troublesome transfer procedures for old accounts, there is really nothing to do, and there is not much difference from the usual busyness and leisure. Therefore, this year's fourth-quarter situation is far less busy than last year, but the procedures for settlement are indeed more difficult than last year. Often, the amount owed by one account involves more than a dozen trips back and forth, and it is impossible to recover it as desired in one stroke. In terms of the recovery of long-term loans from Yongzhuang, only a few percent of the overdue loans are recovered from the huge amount of thousands of millions. If the market is relaxed, with such tight conditions in Yong City, why would one not want to recover the loans? The long-term overdue loans that cannot be largely recovered and the total cost of interest are examined. The highest amount of the Hankou Gang is 12.5 yuan, which cannot be used as an exception. The highest amount of the loan interest rate for other gangs is no more than 10.05 yuan, and the lowest interest rate is still 8 yuan, which seems to be slightly higher than the previous price of 7.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the smooth settlement of the Chinese Securities Exchange, although transactions decreased slightly, the trend turned firm. The Monday correction came to an end, and the bulls still tried to pull up the market. Perhaps due to the extension of the legal tender deadline, sentiment turned firm again, and selling was scarce. Large bulls stopped selling, and the market was tight again. Judging from the buying of numbers 4, 5, 11, and 47, the grade A market price was almost the same as the highest record. The future may still have slight developments. The dull environment and news are also enough to help the power of the bulls. Yesterday, the opening in the morning, with number 11 buying grade E, the market price was maintained, and the forward price immediately saw a rise of 3.5 jiao. Then, due to the shift in sentiment, the prices rose in unison, and the Monday decline stopped here. Although there was a large household selling in the final settlement, buyers were still very active, and the market price saw slight fluctuations. The opening in the afternoon initially seemed weak, but turned tight due to the buying of numbers 5 and 47. The closing was the most active, with numbers 4, 5, 11, 13, and 47 buying one after another. The forward price of grade C even rose by as much as half a yuan, and the rest also rose by 3 to 4 jiao. The closing was tight, and the situation was the best of the day. As a result, the market price rose by 4 jiao to 6.5 jiao in unison. The total number of transactions was 4.54 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table for friends (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market is flat and weak. Due to the sluggish overseas cotton market, market sentiment is mostly bearish. As for the amount absorbed by the bulls, they firmly refuse to release it, but a small portion has been settled clearly due to the relationship of forces. Therefore, the market has become looser. The standard yarn price has fallen by 7 to 8 yuan compared to the high price. If customer yarn sales can continue to come, the market may stabilize, but the bears are currently extremely active. Spot yarn transactions only totaled 96 bales, and the selling price was similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Overview of Cotton Yarn Delivery in April <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yarn: 2,500 bales...Yarn merchants deliver goods; Cotton: Over 90,000 piculs...Tong Kee receives.</p>
<p>The April contract for Golden Rooster brand yarn was priced at 193.9 yuan on November 1st of last year. At that time, the market trend was steadily improving, and the overall outlook was good. The speculative fervor over gold prices was intense, leading to a surge of positive news. Coupled with a reduction in yarn inventory in this city, market prices steadily climbed to a peak. After the implementation of the new currency policy on November 4th, prices jumped by ten yuan in a single session, exceeding 200 yuan. Subsequently, fierce competition between bullish and bearish factions resulted in significant fluctuations. The situation then shifted due to changes in the European political landscape, with escalating tensions between Italy and Abyssinia causing overseas yarn and cotton prices to soar. Speculative yarn prices rose sharply, reaching a peak of 212 yuan on December 4th. However, as the year-end approached, parties began to close positions, and warehouse yarn inventory exceeded 280,000 bales, causing the market price to fall back to the 200 yuan level. By mid-March, due to the development of spring sales and a surge in Japanese yarn prices, gold traders and securities brokers, seeing stagnation in their own businesses, flocked to the yarn and cotton market, driving up demand and prices. High prices reached 209.3 yuan. Unexpectedly, yarn sales slowed down, and the bearish side took advantage of ample supply, with warehouse yarn inventory reaching 31,800 bales. This threatened the market, causing it to decline to 201.6 yuan. However, Mr. Sheng's intention to take delivery remained firm. The final session price was 204.1 yuan, still up 10.02 yuan from the initial price. As a result, the remaining amount to be delivered was 10,005 bales, an increase of 1,300 bales compared to the previous month. The delivery price, calculated based on the final three days, was 203 yuan, one yuan lower than the previous month. Delivered goods included 1,000 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster new yarn, 700 bales of Great Flying艇, and 600 bales of Red Kui Xing, totaling 2,300 bales. The rest were self-delivered. It is said that Mr. Sheng and gold arbitrageurs were the majority of the receivers, while yarn merchants were the majority of the deliverers. The brokerage numbers and delivery details of both receivers and deliverers are listed below.</p>
<p>Delivery of Speculative Yarn</p>
<p>Receipt of Speculative Yarn</p>
<p>The April contract for speculative cotton was priced at 40.02 yuan on November 1st of last year. At that time, the rumor of currency reform was gaining momentum. Simultaneously, domestic cotton production suffered from both floods and droughts, resulting in a sharp decrease in production volume. People were optimistic, and market prices steadily increased. The situation then shifted due to the European situation, and the formal announcement of the new currency on October 4th ignited a frenzy in the market, with prices soaring by three yuan in a single session to 43 yuan. Prices then hovered at a high level, reaching a peak of 45.95 yuan on December 4th. Subsequently, as the year-end approached, and with US cotton futures breaking the one-cent barrier and Indian cotton falling by more than 20 rupees, market prices were again under pressure, falling back to 41.3 yuan on February 26th. Later, Tong Kee and the banking sector absorbed large quantities, holding onto them tightly, and market prices gradually rebounded, reaching a high of 45.2 yuan. Recently, the bearish side has been transporting coarse cotton from various places to Shanghai for delivery, accumulating to over 100,000 piculs. However, the bullish side remained unwilling to let go. The final session price was 45 yuan, still up 4.8 yuan from the initial price. As a result, the remaining amount to be delivered totaled 132,100 piculs, setting a new record for transaction volume since the establishment of the exchange during the era of old cotton, an increase of 86,100 piculs compared to the previous month. The delivery price, calculated based on the final three days, was 44.5 yuan, up 0.5 yuan from the previous month. Delivered goods included 50,000 piculs of Tianjin coarse cotton, 20,000 piculs of Hankou coarse cotton, and 20,000 piculs of Yao cotton. The rest were self-delivered. Deliveries were made by merchants from Sichuan-Hankou, Ningbo, and Shanghai, while Tong Kee independently received over 90,000 piculs, with other arbitrageurs making up the majority. The brokerage numbers and delivery details of both receivers and deliverers are listed below.</p>

<p>Bombay Cotton Market Remained Firm Last Week</p>
<p>Last week, the market remained firm due to short covering. White Luo Creek cotton for delivery in April-May of next year was under pressure from sellers, partly because some exporters swapped nearby positions for distant ones in large quantities, and partly because overseas buyers hedged their purchases here. Demand from the Far East is gradually weakening, and there is nothing special on the European side. Only inquiries from Japan offer some hope of revival. In the spot market, exporters continued to purchase, and Indian yarn mills only bought what they urgently needed. The attached statistics for the past week are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>
<h3 id="e158">Foodstuffs: The Final Day of the Month; Futures Still Weak <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed a trend of initial stability followed by a decline in prices across all months. Foreign wheat quotations were up 0.20 yuan in Chicago for nearby contracts and 0.08 yuan for distant contracts, and up 0.08 yuan in Canada. At the opening, as this month was the final day, off-market short covering led to a rebound to 0.46 yuan. Starting with June, initial concerns about unfavorable weather boosted sentiment, but then sellers emerged, and factories slightly reduced their holdings, causing market sentiment to gradually turn downward. By the afternoon opening, nearby contracts were down 0.01 yuan due to the impending settlement, while distant months saw factories slightly reducing their holdings, and off-market shorts took the opportunity to sell, causing prices to weaken gradually, falling by approximately 0.02 yuan compared to the previous closing price. The future trend will depend on whether the weather improves, which could shake market sentiment.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Wheat Futures Decline with Flour Market <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after opening in the morning, showed a trend of initial stability followed by a decline in prices across all months. Foreign wheat quotations showed little fluctuation, and the persistent rainy weather meant that opening prices for all months were similar to the previous day, with trading not particularly active. By the afternoon opening, prices initially remained stable, but then, due to the decline in the flour market, off-market shorts also gradually sold, causing prices to fall by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan in the second and third sessions. This situation is currently being tested, and significant changes in buying and selling will only occur when the new wheat is harvested and the annual harvest is substantial. The current wheat market is exceptionally quiet, with little activity due to low inventory. One cartload of wheat from Kai'nan Suzhou was priced at 5.28 yuan, a slight increase of 0.02 yuan.</p>
<p>The US wheat market is slightly easing as long positions are sold off. Current demand remains strong, and the weather forecast is uncertain.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the supply of 客秈 remained active, with continued shipments from various Jiangsu and Zhejiang groups. As the weather gradually warms up, sellers, fearing that the goods will not keep for long, are quite willing to settle at lower prices, causing prices to continue to fall by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan. After the price reduction, sales have picked up slightly, and the market no longer appears as sluggish as it did in recent days. Throughout the day, 1,200 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,071 bags of Wengtai rice, 426 bags of Jiangbei rice, and 100 bags of Anqing rice were offered for sale, as well as 290 bags of Siamese rice, all of which were handled by this street.</p>

<p>(滬南) Yesterday, over 30 groups arrived with supplies (totaling over 7,000 piculs), mostly 薄稻. Baowei and Yantai Dalian groups continued to be in short supply, handling only over 2,000 bags. The 薄稻 market was slightly weaker. As for 厚早粳, the market on this street remained stable due to the rainy weather, with little change. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan also saw similar conditions.</p>
<p>(滬北) Yesterday, 24 or 25 boats arrived from 河下 from various routes. Sales of various goods on the market were normal due to the cloudy and humid weather. Prices for high-quality 白粳 were stable, while prices for medium and lower-quality goods were slightly tighter by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. High-quality top-grade 薄稻 was in short supply, and the market was quite firm, with prices tightening by several points. The trend for medium-quality goods was steady, while Baiyuan's sales were slightly active, with prices rebounding by several points. Prices for other goods remained stable.</p>

<p>The sales of ordinary-quality 毫州紅棗 have been sluggish recently, falling by about 0.5 yuan compared to before, selling for 7.5 to 8 yuan. However, good-quality selected goods are occasionally purchased by Guangdong groups, and the market is relatively firm. Yesterday, they sold for 9.5 yuan, with continued sales. The price of 府紅棗 is 7 yuan, while 鷄心紅 is already in short supply at 8.5 yuan, and 元流紅 is selling for 7 yuan, with little trading for all.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained quiet. The association's quotes for 24 coarse white granulated sugar spot and re-export goods remained at the original prices. There were no changes in Dong Chi Bai and Benchang Mian Bai, Zhenji Dahua Jin Xin, and other goods, with few transactions. The quotes for Guo Huo Qing Chi Bai Tang were not released either.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the tender date for the jointly formed sugar industry company. Due to the unsettled issue of rumored tax reductions, traders showed little interest. Of the total quota of 3,128 bags of Guangdong refined sugar, there were no bidders for Wuyang coarse white, Mian Bai, Zhong Sha Bai, and other goods. As a result, only ten bags were sold.</p>

<p>Straw mushrooms, also known as 自生, are also called 北口. They are divided into two types: large and small. In the north, they are called 大自生 and 中自生, while in the south they are called 大口蔴 and 小口丁. They are produced in northern China and Mongolia, with those from 裏八旗 considered the best. The annual production volume is around 1,000 piculs, but in years of poor harvest, it is only 500 to 600 piculs. As things are valued when scarce, the value is high, and only those with means can afford them. The most prosperous sales locations are Tianjin, Hankou, Sichuan, Fujian, and Guangdong, followed by this city and Hangzhou, Suzhou, Ningbo, and other places, where sales are also quite significant. Currently, high-quality 大口蔴 sells for 950 to 920 yuan, ordinary goods for 800 to 760 to 70 yuan, 裏八旗 small 口丁 for 820 yuan, and high-quality goods from other regions for 650 to 660 yuan, with the lowest only 470 to 80 yuan. Currently, there is not much inventory in the entire street, and the market situation is quite stable. However, the rainy season is approaching, and the goods must be protected from moisture. If they are not stored properly, they can easily change color, and once reworked, there is no good solution. Fortunately, with the development of science, there are cold storage facilities, so those who store more have already stored them in cold storage, preparing for sales in autumn and winter.</p>
<p>Agar-agar arrivals are gradually increasing, but as the weather is gradually getting warmer, business from客帮 is also showing signs of life. Markets such as Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Henan, and this street are more lively than before, and the market atmosphere is thus colored. Yesterday's prices from industry insiders (天雪) 300 yuan, (單雪) (氷淸) (金鶴) 295 yuan, (銀雪) (白燕) 292 yuan, (光雪) (白天) 288 yuan, (白玉) (玉潔) 280 yuan, (白龍) (玉池) 265 yuan.</p>

<p>The black tea industry in Hunan and Hubei provinces has seen some development. The tea-producing areas in various regions have gradually been pacified from banditry, and tea farmers have mostly resumed their old businesses. The number of tea merchants has also increased to over 110. After the Guyu Festival, tea picking has commenced in Taoyuan, Pingjiang, Anhua, Liuyang, Tongshan, Yanglou Dong, Niejiashi, and other places. It is said that due to the adequate rainfall this spring, the tea tree branches and leaves are lush, and the future production volume is expected to be abundant. However, the tea merchants' capital is not strong, and they are currently negotiating with merchants in Hankou to expand financing to facilitate operations. Tea industry experts estimate that the volume of black tea in Hunan and Hubei may increase to over 200,000, provided that the financial aspect is not constrained in the future.</p>

<p>New tea from 六安, Huo Shan, and Taiping in Anhui province has been listed in large quantities in recent days. Tea-producing areas in various regions have been thronged by tea merchants from Shanghai and Hankou, and客帮 from Shandong, Henan, and other provinces have also rushed to search for and handle advantageous deals. Sales of 芽茶 are very robust, with 六安提莊 goods opening at 320 yuan, and the rest opening at 240 to 250 yuan, an average increase of 20 yuan compared to last year. Therefore, tea farmers are all happy.</p>

<p>According to news from Si'an, tea farmers in various regions of Huzhou have begun picking new tea in recent days. However, due to the cold weather, the tea buds are only slightly exposed and have not fully developed, resulting in sluggish shipments of new goods. Currently, tea merchants from various regions are arriving one after another, and the price of new tea is expected to be around 74 to 75 yuan.</p>

Currently, six tea companies have been established in the Badu Haikou area and are preparing to procure new goods for production and sales abroad.</p>

<p>White rubber cloth: Sales have started to pick up recently, with客帮 needing it earlier than this street. East-made wide-width (one yard per door) is even more popular. Yesterday, the merchant 洋行 opened seven or eight boxes of spot goods, with 20 pieces per box, totaling about 7,000 yards. The transaction price was 0.53 yuan. About 2,000 yards of 28-inch Old Knife brand were also transacted at 0.36 yuan, with delivery after payment in cash. N绒 shops sell zero pieces to tailors, adding 0.02 yuan per yard. Because their profit is low, they also require payment in cash.</p>
<p>Yellow twill: Western-style tailor shops have recently continued to search for it, and sales are quite smooth. Summer school uniforms are being made, and orders are being placed one after another. The Guo Huo Dafeng brand is selling especially well, because the authorities specify that Guo Huo must be used and have color depth considerations. The Seven Sons闹元宵 and 一品當朝 two brands are in short supply.</p>

<p>Paper-wrapped iron wire is an essential commodity for cigarette companies. Recently, due to the approaching mold season and the downturn in cigarette sales, demand has stagnated. Sales to other groups have also been sluggish due to limited real sales. Due to the poor market sentiment, the price drop is particularly severe. The current price is 21 yuan per box (200 pounds), a small decrease of more than one yuan compared to before, and there are few scattered transactions these days, so those who hold this commodity are quite pessimistic.</p>

The amount of goods on the market is sufficient to supply the market for four or five months and still have a surplus, so market sentiment is greatly fatigued and the price has fallen sharply. For example, coarse 花色 opens at around 8 yuan, medium-grade 花色 sells for 9 yuan, and fine 花色 opens at 10 yuan import duty. For large transactions and cash sales, the price may be reduced further.</p>

<p>Near the end of the Ming Dynasty, a very righteous woodcutter appeared in Dongting Mountain, Suzhou. No one knew his surname or given name, but because he was tall and had a full beard, everyone called him Beard Woodcutter. Beard Woodcutter was very strong. Others could only carry 100 catties, but he could carry 240 catties, but he still sold it at the price of 100 catties. Someone asked him why he did that, and he said, "Anyway, the firewood comes from the mountains, and it only depends on strength, without any capital. Although I am strong, my appetite is no bigger than others, so why sell it for more money?"</p>
<p>Beard Woodcutter was illiterate, but he liked to listen to others talk about past events. Because he was straightforward, he liked loyal ministers and righteous people, and hated treacherous ministers and villains. Sometimes his criticism of the rights and wrongs of people in the past was very accurate, and those who studied medicine and understood etiquette were no better than that.</p>
<p>Once, there was a theatrical performance in the village. Beard Woodcutter was returning from the mountains with firewood and passed under the stage. The stage was performing The Story of Yue Fei, and Qin Hui had just come out. The actor playing Qin Hui played it perfectly, like a living traitor. Beard Woodcutter watched and couldn't restrain his anger. He jumped onto the stage with a flying leap, knocked down the actor playing Qin Hui with a palm, held him down, and rained blows on him with his fists and feet, hitting him until his head was broken and bleeding. People nearby managed to persuade him to stop. Beard Woodcutter still shouted, "He became a prime minister, but he framed loyal people and ruined the country. It's too good for him that he isn't beaten to death!"</p>
<p>Someone nearby said, "This is just a play, it's fake."</p>
<p>Beard Woodcutter said, "I know it's fake, that's why I'm beating him. If it were real, I would have chopped him up long ago!"</p>
<p>Beard Woodcutter was also not superstitious. One of his older brothers went to Maoshan to worship, fell off a cliff, and died. Some superstitious people said that because his brother drank wine and was not sincere, he was beaten to death by Wang Lingguan with a golden whip. When Beard Woodcutter heard this, he rushed to Maoshan day and night. He deliberately got very drunk, ran to the hall, pointed at the statue of Wang Lingguan, and cursed, "You are a real piece of trash, using the guise of the patriarch to act like a tyrant here! My brother came to offer incense, which was a good intention, and drinking wine is not a capital crime. Why did you kill him? Today, I'm not only not offering incense, but I'm also here drunk, see if you dare to do anything to me! Dare to kill me? Hmph, I guess you wouldn't dare. Why are you staring at me and waving your whip? Fine, I'll just smash your damn whip and smash your mother-loving face!"</p>
<p>As soon as Beard Woodcutter finished speaking, he was about to jump up and snatch the whip from Wang Lingguan's hand. The incense-worshippers around him desperately stopped him. Afterward, Beard Woodcutter moved his brother's body back home.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a man named Chen Xueqi living in Dongting Mountain. His parents had both passed away, and he had been betrothed to a girl surnamed Zou since he was a child. The date had already been set, and they were about to get married when Zou girl's older brother suddenly changed his mind. He was a snob and did not allow Zou girl to marry into the Chen family, but instead offered her to a wealthy local gentleman in Suzhou as a concubine. When Chen Xueqi heard about this, he was frantic and rushed to the city to file a lawsuit. But officials protect each other, and the official was also afraid of the wealthy gentleman's influence and dared not do anything. Chen Xueqi also sued Zou girl's older brother, but the official refused and instead kicked him out. The officials don't care about this kind of thing, so who would dare to stand up? Chen Xueqi was so anxious that he had nowhere to turn.</p>
<p>One day, Chen Xueqi met Beard Woodcutter on the road and told him about the whole thing, and said, "I have long heard that you are very righteous and willing to help people. Now that I have encountered such a heartbreaking thing, can you help me think of a way?"</p>
<p>Beard Woodcutter thought for a moment and said, "Alright. But this matter cannot be done in three or two days, you must wait."</p>
<p>When Chen Xueqi heard Beard Woodcutter's promise, he quickly knelt down and kowtowed, saying, "You are a really good person! If I can meet my wife, then you will be my reborn parents."</p>
<p>Beard Woodcutter said, "You are too kind! It is nothing," as he helped Chen Xueqi up.</p>
<p>Although Beard Woodcutter was illiterate, he was also a meticulous man. He knew that if he wanted to rescue Zou girl, he had to go to the wealthy gentleman's house. A household like the wealthy gentleman's was not easy to enter, but Beard Woodcutter had a plan.</p>
<p>Beard Woodcutter ran to the city and found a human trafficker's house. He pretended to say that he had come to find someone to help him find work, that he had a lot of strength, and that he would be best as a sedan chair carrier. Soon after, Beard Woodcutter actually went to work as a sedan chair carrier at the wealthy gentleman's house. Because he was strong and worked diligently, the wealthy gentleman liked him very much and even allowed him to enter and exit the inner courtyard at will.</p>
<p>After some time, Beard Woodcutter already knew that the third concubine was Zou girl. As soon as he had the opportunity, he would discuss it with her.</p>
<p>One day, Beard Woodcutter ran into Zou girl in the back courtyard. There was no one around, which was a good opportunity to talk. Beard Woodcutter quickly walked up to her and said in a low voice, "Zou girl, you are living a very comfortable life now, but do you still remember Chen Lang?"</p>
<p>Zou girl was suddenly shocked to see an unfamiliar old man saying this to her. "Who are you?" she asked.</p>
<p>Beard Woodcutter said, "Girl, don't you recognize me? I am Beard Woodcutter, and Chen Lang asked me to inquire about your news. Chen Lang misses you very much!"</p>
<p>Zou girl calmed herself and said, "Sir, how can I leave Chen Lang behind! I originally wanted to find a way to die, but I couldn't escape from that murderer. He had many people, and he had them tie up my hands and feet and strip off my clothes. He defiled me that very night. I am truly sorry for Chen Lang! It's good that you came, sir. I beg you to rescue me and let me meet Chen Lang. I would be willing to die!" As she spoke, she burst into tears.</p>
<p>Beard Woodcutter quickly said, "Girl, there is no need to be like this. There are many eyes and ears here. Anyway, I will do my best."</p>
<p>A long time passed. One day, the wealthy gentleman's wife wanted to take the concubines to tour Tianping Mountain. When Beard Woodcutter heard about it, he thought to himself, "The opportunity has come!" So he first went to the riverside to hire a boat before going back to carry the sedan chair. He intentionally carried the third sedan chair, in which Zou girl was sitting. That sedan chair carrier had also been bribed by Beard Woodcutter.</p>
<p>As soon as they left the city, Beard Woodcutter took another fork in the road and rushed towards the river like the wind. The servants who were following saw that something was wrong and also shouted and rushed after them. Beard Woodcutter arrived at the river, put down the sedan chair, helped Zou girl out, and helped her onto the boat. The pursuers also arrived. The sedan chair carrier had already left. Beard Woodcutter turned back, mustered his power, and knocked down three or four people with three punches and two kicks. The others also ran away. Beard Woodcutter then returned to the boat, hoisted the sails, and sailed downwind. By the time the second group of people arrived, the wind was strong and the water was swift, and Beard Woodcutter had already taken Zou girl to Chen Xueqi's house.</p>
<p>When Chen Xueqi and his wife met, there is no need to describe their joy and sorrow. They were so grateful to Beard Woodcutter that they were willing to risk their lives for him. After this incident, Beard Woodcutter's reputation for righteousness and helping those in need grew even greater.</p>
<p>A few years later, Li Zicheng broke through Beijing, and Emperor Chongzhen died on Meishan Mountain. People in the village were saying, "Li Zicheng has become the emperor!"</p>
<p>Beard Woodcutter initially didn't believe it, but after asking a few people, they all said the same thing. Beard Woodcutter was furious and jumped up and down, shouting, "I only know that the emperor's surname is Zhu. What is Li Zicheng that he should become the emperor? Where has my emperor gone? Aren't there any civil and military officials in the Qing Dynasty who can save the emperor? Are these people just going to eat and take money and then become subjects of the thief? Your Majesty, I am old and cannot kill the thieves, so I can only repay you with my death! Your Majesty, wait for me, I am coming!"</p>
<p>Beard Woodcutter ran to the edge of Taihu Lake in one breath. He looked at the vast water, then looked up and shouted "Heaven!" three times. With a "plop," he jumped into Taihu Lake, causing a burst of bubbles. Beard Woodcutter was finished. Beard Woodcutter was already in his sixties when he died.</p>
<h3 id="e175">George Stephenson (1781-1848) <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jizhen</p>
<p>He went from being the lowest miner to an engineer, from being illiterate to a great scientist, with no other secret than:</p>
<p>Learn how to do it—only fearing you don't understand</p>
<p>Ask why—not fearing others' ridicule</p>
<p>George Stephenson was born on June 9, 1781, in a village near Newcastle, England. His father was a coal miner, and his income was not even enough to feed his family, so he certainly couldn't afford his children's education. At the age of nine, Stephenson was sent to be a shepherd to ease his father's burden. A few years later, his father took him to the mine to do odd jobs, and he was assigned to clean the steam engine. While cleaning the steam engine, he studied its structure and quickly became familiar with it. He made models of various machines out of clay, which were so lifelike and well-made that everyone who saw them praised his skill.</p>
<p>The foreman in the mine saw that he was meticulous and hardworking and liked him very much, so he promoted him to be in charge of the water pump. The most frightening thing in the mine was water. If the water was not pumped out and allowed to rise, it could immediately cause a disaster, drowning the miners, destroying the mineral deposits, and potentially ruining the entire project. Fortunately, James Watt had already invented the water pump at that time, which was inexpensive and highly efficient, and was the only effective tool for preventing flooding in the mine. Stephenson became a water pump worker. Seeing the automatic up-and-down movement of the water pump, he was very surprised and wondered all day long: "Why can the fire in the furnace turn the water in the pot into steam? Why can steam make the whole machine turn?" He pondered and worried but could not figure out the reason, so he had to ask other colleagues. Several people he asked did not understand the reason. One day, he asked an experienced worker. The old man glared at him and scolded him, "What nonsense are you talking about, kid! If you keep daydreaming like this instead of working honestly, who would want to hire you? Just wait and see, you'll starve to death before you reach my age." After a while, he proudly held up three fingers to Stephenson and said, "I've been a worker for thirty years and have never been unemployed for a single day, entirely because I'm content with my lot, mind my own business, don't try to climb high, and don't think of good things. Good boy, learn from me!"</p>
<p>Stephenson was very angry when he heard this and couldn't help but retort, "Learn from you! What future is there in learning from you? A person should always do something worthwhile in life. How can you be a slave to bread for the rest of your life?" The old worker did not expect this child to dare to argue with him and immediately became angry out of embarrassment. He grabbed Stephenson's hair and asked, "Worthwhile child, tell me! Tell me! What is a worthwhile thing?" Stephenson did not want to argue with him and quickly shook off his hand and ran away. Unexpectedly, he stumbled and, after running only a few dozen steps, bumped into an engineer. The engineer thought Stephenson was causing some trouble and did not accept his apology, but called him back. The old worker saw this from afar and was very happy. He thought this child's job was definitely broken this time. Who knew that after the engineer understood the whole story, he liked Stephenson's eagerness to learn and explained to him: "Water turns into steam when heated, and steam has power that can drive the machinery, making the whole machine turn. This simple principle of steam has already been explained by Watt, but unfortunately, you are illiterate, so you don't know. You should try to find some time to study. All the important principles in the world are in books. You won't be able to understand them if you don't study."</p>
<p>At this time, Stephenson was already nineteen years old and did not know a single character. He felt very uncomfortable after hearing the engineer's words and couldn't sleep all night thinking about it. He scolded himself: "We are all illiterate, all fools. One fool is no better than another. Why did I argue with that old man today? I want to do something worthwhile, but if I'm illiterate, I won't understand the principles. How can I do anything?" He hated himself for being illiterate and unable to do worthwhile things, pinching himself and hitting himself like a madman. Finally, he figured it out and jumped out of bed happily, saying, "What's the rush? I just need to study hard. Although I'm already nineteen years old now, if I can work twice as hard as others, won't I be able to catch up with the educated men of my age in ten years?" So he was determined to study hard, working in the mine during the day and attending night school in the evening. He started reading ABCs in the same class as six- or seven-year-old children. The children saw that he was so old and just starting to read and laughed at him, calling him "Big Fool." He started reading from ABCs and learning to count from one, two, three. He pronounced the sounds with his forehead straight, and when he read, it sounded like he was hawking goods, which made the teacher and classmates couldn't help but laugh. He wanted to use the ability to read to help him do worthwhile things, so he didn't care about anything, wasn't shy, wasn't afraid of difficulties, and only knew how to bow his head and work hard. Because he worked so hard, he naturally made extraordinary progress. In just a few years, he understood all the scientific principles. So he decided that scientific invention was the most worthwhile thing to do and began to study steam engines.</p>
<p>In the past, he was amazed by Watt's water pump. Now, after some research, he felt that it was too crude. One day, he said to the engineer who had previously advised him to study, "Sir, look, Watt's water pump can never pump the water completely dry. Do you know the reason?" The engineer thought Stephenson was asking a foolish question again because of his ignorance and laughed, "If I knew the reason, I would be an inventor too." Stephenson was embarrassed to say the reason when he heard the engineer say this. Finally, he couldn't help but break his silence and boldly led the engineer to the water pump, pointing out the shortcomings here and there and explaining how it could be improved. The engineer felt that what Stephenson said made some sense and agreed to give him a chance to experiment. After the engineer left, Stephenson's colleagues surrounded him and laughed, saying, "Friend, you are just a worker, not an engineer. Don't overestimate yourself and make a fool of yourself. Improve the machine? Many top-notch engineers have no way. Stop daydreaming!"</p>
<p>Stephenson knew that it was useless to argue with ignorant people. He just smiled and didn't say anything. After everyone went off work, he started his experiment. After a few days, the mine was dry, without any water accumulation, and all the workers were able to work conveniently because of this. They were surprised and happy and went around asking who had done this good deed. When they found out that Stephenson had improved the water pump, everyone was shocked. From then on, not only did no one (including the old worker who had offended Stephenson before) not respect Stephenson, but even the workers themselves knew how to respect themselves. The mine owner knew that Stephenson was a promising person and immediately promoted him to chief engineer.</p>
<p>There was another terrible disaster in the mine—floods. The mines used candles, and the flames were not shielded, so they often came into contact with violent or highly flammable gases, causing explosions or fires, which often killed countless people. In order to protect his colleagues and repay the mine owner's recognition, Stephenson invented a safety lamp to replace candles. But he believed that this was only the result of his preliminary research, and he refused to be complacent because of this. He wanted to do something great and be a great inventor. So he worked day and night to study steam engines. As a result, it took him fifteen years to invent the train and the railway, which facilitated transportation around the world and accelerated the progress of human civilization. His contribution is truly "immeasurable."</p>

<h3 id="e176">On the Problem of Textbooks <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Hanmei</p>
<p>The problem of textbooks in today's large, medium, and small schools has indeed reached a very serious point. Whether in the arts or sciences, when school authorities or instructors choose a textbook for a particular subject, they always find it extremely difficult and not easy to achieve satisfactory results. At the same time, even if they reluctantly choose a relatively suitable textbook, in fact, not only do the teachers still feel pain, but the students also feel all kinds of problems and have no interest in learning. Therefore, the impact on the level of students in general large, medium, and small schools is also conceivable.</p>
<p>Regarding textbooks for primary and secondary schools, although there are curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education to follow when compiling them, these curriculum standards only have general guidance. The right to choose and discard all materials still lies with the compilers themselves. At the same time, every textbook must be submitted to the Ministry of Education for review, but the main point of the review is to focus on the negative aspects, such as whether it violates the curriculum standards. Therefore, the key to the excellence of textbooks lies entirely with the compilers.</p>
<p>Now, let's take the Chinese textbooks for secondary schools as an example. The poverty and dryness of their content are really beyond expectations. As for the aspects of vernacular Chinese, then they are either works from the enlightenment era of one or two decades ago or awkward and tortuous translations. As for the aspects of classical Chinese, then articles from Guwen Guanzhi, Zhan Guo Ce, Li Sao, and Shi Ji are adopted in large quantities. As for the literature of the last ten years, it is simply rare. As a result, middle school students find writing very difficult. Junior high school students who read a lot of vernacular Chinese write articles that learn from those awkward and tortuous translations, describing moonlight that goes all the way from quicksilver to neon lights, and describing walking that goes all the way from the swaying of willow branches to incense-burning old women. High school students who read a lot of classical Chinese can't catch up with even one millionth of the literary spirit of the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song dynasties, let alone the writing style of Li Sao and Shi Ji. It's simply impossible to get even a smooth classical Chinese article for newspaper reporting. Speaking of this, the author must solemnly state that it is not to say that the articles in the current Chinese textbooks are all undesirable, but to say why not adopt more modern literature as articles for middle school students to recite? Why are middle school students made to study in detail articles that are at least twenty years old, and as many as thousands of years old, away from modern thought? At the same time, the compilation style is also extremely ridiculous. The teachers who compile the textbooks don't know whether they are for the convenience of the teachers or to please the students? They often annotate and explain the difficult words and sentences one by one. As a result, the teachers don't have to prepare, and the students can save on buying a dictionary. I don't know if this method is ultimately beneficial or harmful to middle school students? Taking middle school geography textbooks as an example, the part about products is always "coal and iron are very rich," "antimony, lead, and other minerals are very rich." The statistical figures are rare. Is it really impossible to find any statistical figures in China? Other examples include history textbooks, which do not focus on scientific explanations when describing ancient society, but still talk about the creation of heaven and earth; the changes of dynasties do not focus on the socio-economic system, but still record a running account of the imperial family. Such examples are too numerous to mention! How can such textbooks not be considered misleading children? This is from the content of middle school textbooks. If we take a closer look at the textbooks of universities and primary schools, there will certainly be many problems, which urgently need careful research and correction. As for the expensive pricing of textbooks, it is also worth our serious attention. Now, a textbook of about one hundred pages is priced at least fifty or sixty cents, and at most seventy or eighty cents. Two volumes often cost about one dollar and forty or fifty cents, which is a great difficulty for the children of the average middle-class family.</p>
<p>The reason why the textbooks of large, medium, and small schools are so bad, I think, is also due to certain reasons. In order to compete commercially or for economic considerations, publishing houses either produce them crudely and hastily due to time constraints or fail to hire people with rich knowledge and experience due to remuneration issues. This has led to today's phenomenon. Excellent teachers who teach in large, medium, and small schools often have no time for this due to the pressure of life. As a result, teachers cannot make significant contributions, and publishing houses cannot have satisfactory achievements.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of textbooks, the author often has a dream, which I might as well write here for the reference of the educational administration authorities: I think that to hope that the textbooks of large, medium, and small schools are excellent, the highest educational administration agency should bear a kind of responsibility, that is, the work of compiling textbooks should be the responsibility of the government. Divide the country's provinces and cities into several educational districts (the division of districts is based on the differences in cultural level). Set up a national university, a national middle school, and a national primary school in each educational district. Raise the salaries of teachers as much as possible, reduce the teaching hours as much as possible, and give them job security. Give them the responsibility of compiling textbooks for large, medium, and small schools. After compiling the textbooks for large, medium, and small schools in one or two years, hand them over to major Chinese publishing houses for distribution on the one hand, and ask teachers from large, medium, and small schools across the country to strictly criticize them on the other hand. Of course, these sets of textbooks are not immutable, as the fixed editions of each educational district, but must be revised every year and supplemented every year. The author firmly believes that as long as the methods are careful and the selection of talents is strict, the serious problem of textbooks can be solved, and we can reach our ideal state.</p>

<p>A.C. Pigou, original author, Xu Zongshi, translator, Commercial Press publication</p>
<p>——The crisis of the Second World War is obviously approaching. The efforts of various countries to expand their military preparations, the increasing prosperity of the military industry, and the active advancement of wartime preparations, all the disputes, all the contradictions, need a general solution and general liquidation through war. Although people all over the world, in view of the cruelty, sacrifice, and horror of the First World War, have a psychology of fearing war, whether the Second World War will break out does not depend on whether people in general fear war or not, but depends on the interests of the general financial groups and the intentions of ambitious people. At the same time, in the east and west of this earth, we have heard that a powder keg is about to explode, but the powder keg in the East is much more serious and critical than the one in the West. For the sake of the fate of the country and the survival of the nation, people across the country should begin preparations for a very special period. Then, wartime economics, which determines the victory or defeat of the overall war situation, must be deeply studied.</p>
<p>Xu Zongshi's translation of A.C. Pigou's "Wartime Economics," although the original author cannot escape the confines of liberal economics, and also emphasizes the situation in the UK during the European era, whether in time or place, there is a sense of being too far away, but this practical lesson is always a very valuable page. Moreover, it encompasses rich content, and the theory is well-organized, which is certainly not comparable to the general ordinary special books that record the economic and financial situation in Europe at that time. Therefore, the author believes that this book must be solemnly introduced to the general readers.</p>
<p>The contents of the book are divided into the following eighteen chapters: First, Introduction; Second, The Impact of War; Third, The Economic Causes of War; Fourth, The Resources of War; Fifth, The Real and Monetary Sacrifices and Expenses of War; Sixth, The Choice of Personal Austerity; Seventh, Government Requisition; Eighth, Taxation and Public Debt; Ninth, Methods of Raising Free Public Debt; Tenth, Methods of Manufacturing Bank Credit to Raise War Expenses; Eleventh, Price Control; Twelfth, Quantitative Allocation of Consumers; Thirteenth, Quantitative Allocation of Raw Materials Purchased with Priority and Factories; Fourteenth, Subsidies; Fifteenth, Rehabilitation of Currency and Exchange; Sixteenth, Management of Imported Goods and Foreign Investment; Seventeenth, Rehabilitation of Internal Debt; Eighteenth, Government Control Issues After the War. In these eighteen chapters, the author takes into account both theory and practice, and elaborates in detail. Although most of them focus on the situation in the UK, there are many things that can be used as a reference for our country. The book has two hundred and forty-two pages, more than one hundred thousand words, and is priced at one dollar and three cents, published by the Commercial Press.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Publication Award <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Tianyi</p>
<p>——A suggestion——</p>
<p>The desolation of the publishing industry is a fact. It is also a fact that there have been no great works in philosophy, science, literature, etc. in recent years. There are certainly many reasons for this, but the author believes that in addition to negative criticism and positive guidance, the government should have the necessity to set up "publication awards."</p>
<p>In any country, assuming that considerable attention is paid to cultural undertakings, then material rewards such as academic subsidies and subsidies must be spared no effort. However, in China, there is currently no such method, which we cannot but consider a great regret!</p>
<p>According to the author's view, the Chinese government should set up "publication awards," divided into departments such as philosophy, politics, economics, education, international relations, chemistry, physics, and literature. If there are books in the above-mentioned professional theories that are explained in a given year, and the content is very excellent and qualified by expert review, then in addition to the author receiving the bonus, the publishing agency should also be given material rewards.</p>
<p>Its benefits can make publishing houses more diligent in their own business, writers more diligent in their own research, and the academic atmosphere in the country can also be improved and cultivated.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Rickshaw Pullers Welfare Association <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the rickshaw owners were dissatisfied with the authorities' firm implementation of rent reduction, and stopped parking their vehicles to strike in protest. The rickshaw puller turmoil lasted for three consecutive days, and order was restored only on the 4th when the rickshaw owners accepted the reduction method, but the losses on both sides had reached more than 100,000 yuan. The rickshaw owners are to blame, so there is no need to say more. As for the rickshaw pullers who eat what they earn every day, they suffered invisible unemployment due to the rickshaw owners stopping their vehicles, and this loss cannot be calculated. At that time, the commentators unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with both parties manipulating and using rickshaw pullers, and proposed reducing rents and abolishing the membership fees paid by rickshaw pullers to the mutual aid association. However, due to the rickshaw owners' surrender, the turmoil was temporarily ended, and only God knows the invisible losses suffered by the rickshaw pullers in the past three days.</p>
<p>The next problem that arose was the restriction on registration. Rickshaw pullers are really doomed to have many misfortunes. One wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. On the 15th, the unemployed rickshaw pullers were registered. Due to vehicle restrictions, only 5,000 people could be supplemented to fill the vacancies, while the number of unemployed people reached 30,000 to 40,000. As a result, a big commotion occurred, resulting in the destruction of fifteen trams and cars, and many people were injured. The eleven arrested rickshaw pullers, including Mei Hongzhong, were sentenced on the 27th. They were convicted of "disturbing order" and sentenced to fifty days of detention. The cause of this dispute was the restriction on registration, and the reason why the unemployed rickshaw pullers rioted was nothing more than to make a living by any means. Therefore, the biggest reason is that the authorities have not paid attention to the suffering of the rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>Now, the Rickshaw Pullers Association of the Special Zone is seeking to organize a rickshaw pullers welfare association from party and government agencies. Needless to say, we also know that this is an organization that handles rickshaw pullers' welfare affairs. And in the evening newspaper on the 27th, we have seen the preparatory meeting of the welfare association, and the following three items were resolved—1. The location of the association is decided to be in the Nanyang Bridge area. 2. The expenses shall be borne by the contractors in each district. 3. The association should handle the guarantee of rickshaw pullers' work based on factual needs. It was also decided to first launch two items: "Theft Car Guarantee" and "Vehicle Safety Insurance."</p>
<p>After reading their resolutions and the two welfare undertakings that were launched first, we believe that they have failed to fulfill the responsibility of this welfare association. We believe that all welfare undertakings should start from the most urgent aspects, and it is necessary to deeply understand the suffering of rickshaw pullers. Regarding the suffering of rickshaw pullers, in addition to the inability of unemployed rickshaw pullers to maintain their lives, such as the turmoil caused by the infighting between the Car Committee and the rickshaw owners, which caused great suffering, and the inhuman treatment they receive daily, as well as the collection of membership fees from the mutual aid association, etc., are all urgent issues that need to be resolved. As for all insurance undertakings, educational undertakings, entertainment undertakings, etc., they can only be discussed after relieving the current suffering. Otherwise, abandoning the relief of the current suffering and only seeking that empty and unrealistic welfare undertaking, what welfare can be said to the rickshaw pullers themselves?</p>

<p>— Zhuo Er</p>
<p>Low, cramped houses huddled together, forming this small alley, looking almost like a group of ragged, filthy, and hunchbacked old beggars. Matted, messy hair, revealing gaunt faces covered in wrinkles, bodies laden with filth, emitting a foul odor, and constantly waving arms covered in sores, as if begging someone for something... The alley crouches in the darkness like in a season without sunlight, flashing hateful eyes, chasing after a gray fate.</p>
<p>It's not strange that people live here, like in other places, but what sets it apart is that only women reside here. Men only come to satisfy certain desires. They have no husbands, no families, no hierarchical distinctions. They are a group determined by the conditions of life, engaging in the same means of survival. Their lives continue in segments, and within each "segment," they complete a unit of transaction. Yesterday it was like this, today it is like this, and tomorrow it will be like this, continuing on and on...</p>
<p>The low houses let in no sunlight at all (the sunlight is blocked by the high walls standing in front). So inside, everything is only vague, filled with a black mist. The walls are damp, and the base of the walls is covered with moss and fungi. The damp smell permeates the air, assaulting the nasal passages, making one feel suffocated and uncomfortable, or even want to vomit, but they are completely unfazed!</p>
<p>Morning here replaces night, but at night, this place becomes the most active. At this time, the pulse of their lives beats at a high speed.</p>
<p>"Let's go, let's go to the lane!"</p>
<p>Hardworking, single men, having finished their day's work, with tired hearts, seek comfort from them. In the hazy night, they search for suitable companions...</p>
<p>They stand under the dim streetlights in the alley, singing coarse and simple love songs, their voices so low and hoarse, with a broken tremor. They flaunt their charms to the single men, hoping to gain someone's favor. So they further adorn themselves, transforming themselves to be significantly different from others, so that they are easily noticed. They compete with each other, vying for beauty in the dark.</p>
<p>A'gen Sao, almost forty years old, is one of the oldest in the alley. She probably came here in her teens. She has spent decades of gray years here. She knows that this is a disreputable profession, but when she thinks that there is no other way to make a living, she feels at ease. Instead, she thinks engaging in this profession is right, sacred, and does not diminish her personality. So she cleverly shifts to another thought, lightly saying, "Fate..."</p>
<p>This fate plays with the women in the alley.</p>
<p>A'gen Sao, like her young and pretty companions, dresses herself a bit cleaner, applies powder and rouge to her face. She tries her best to appear young and pretty, to win the love of young men, swaying her fat body, chasing after every man.</p>
<p>"Sir, sir, come and have some fun! It's very pleasant..."</p>
<p>Her voice is as hoarse as a male duck, mixed with a plea in its softness. Like this, she surrounds every man, following closely. But, those young men disappoint her. They only glance up and down at her, then burst out laughing. They only tease her, saying, "Are you eighty years old?... You old grandma..." They abandon her, ignoring her, and leave with young women in their arms!</p>
<p>She numbly loses every hope. She quickly catches up to another man who comes to the alley: "Have pity on me! Kind sir: "Would you like to sit in my house for a while, sir...?" "...Very cheap, sir..."</p>
<p>How hard are their hearts! They quickly escape her entanglement. Her pitiful pleas only earn her many frivolous slanders! Those young companions who have obtained customers smile ingratiatingly at the customers, swaying their waists, making malicious faces at her as they pass by. She dares not look directly at their proud appearance. She turns her head aside. Her heart is filled with bursts of severe pain, as if someone is cutting it into pieces, slice by slice...</p>
<p>Everything before her eyes is blurred by tears.</p>
<p>--"I am not good anymore! I no longer have the ability to compete with my younger companions..." she thinks this. "...I, I was also so young before!... I was also welcomed by men, but now it is over, forgotten like the old women of the past..."</p>
<p>"The young women of today will also grow old one day..."</p>
<p>She feels indescribably sad in her heart, and at the same time, she sees the future fate of her young companions.</p>
<p>"If only this alley didn't exist one day!</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>..." she mutters softly.</p>
<p>Looking up at the sky, it is pitch black with not a trace of light. The dilapidated and small houses are made to appear even shorter under the backdrop of the dark sky, as if about to collapse.</p>
<p>Vulgar words of flirtation, unrestrained, playful laughter crawl out from every room: and waves of shallow, lewd ditties rise and fall, disturbing the quiet of the alley. Few people walk in the alley. A'gen Sao knows that there is no hope again today. She wanders aimlessly.</p>
<p>"Let these houses all collapse together and crush these people to death!..." she says hatefully.</p>
<h3 id="e181">After Viewing "Thunderstorm" <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>The China Traveling Theatre Troupe Performs at the Carlton</p>
<p>When "Thunderstorm" was performed by the Fudan Drama Society, I wrote some impressions. Due to the script's tight and vivid structure, the personality of each character was well grasped, coupled with a not bad performance, I was more moved than when I read the script. Now, four months later, I have the opportunity to see the performance of the professional "China Traveling Theatre Troupe," which moved me again.</p>
<p>Mr. Cao Yu, the author of "Thunderstorm," once said in an article about how he wrote "Thunderstorm" that he intended to have a "prologue" and an "epilogue" (although there are no these two scenes in the current performance, it is not difficult for us to get a glimpse of the author's creative attitude.) He said: "Simply put, it is to send the theatergoers home with a sorrowful mood, heads bowed, thinking deeply, thinking about these people who are tormented in passion, dreams, and calculations. What should be rippling in their hearts is a water-like sorrow, endless, rather than a feeling of confusion and terror, recalling Thunderstorm like a nightmare; death, pain like a pair of pliers clamping the heart, unable to catch a breath. In short, it is to "guide the audience's emotions into a wider sea of ​​contemplation."</p>
<p>Because of this, the author is like "old fathers whose faces are engraved with the wrinkles of experience, in the gloomy ancestral hall, vividly telling the story of the ghostly fire on the grave and the zombies in the wild temple," the listeners feel "fear creeping up their skin, and it seems that swaying ghost shadows flicker in the corners of the wall," but the story can be "vividly told," as if it is "a very distant place in time."</p>
<p>Therefore, although "Thunderstorm" exposes the sins of a large family, the author "did not consciously realize that I (the author, hereinafter the same) wanted to correct, satirize, or attack anything. Perhaps writing to the end vaguely felt a kind of majestic surge pushing me, I was venting suppressed anger, slandering Chinese families and society."</p>
<p>It is said that when the "China Traveling Theatre Troupe" rehearsed "Thunderstorm" in North China, the author personally participated and contributed his opinions. Therefore, if we say that it is faithful to the original work, then it can probably be said to be "faithful" (for example, the ending of the fourth act is the same as the original.) However, in my personal opinion, comparing it with the performance of Fudan, I feel that Fudan's revision is tighter, especially the end of the fourth act, and Lu Dahai's departure, are much more powerful than this version!</p>
<p>In terms of performance skills, the "China Traveling Theatre Troupe" is better than "Fudan." The reason it is better is because of their proficiency and their average. Lighting, sound effects, and stage design have generally reached the point where they are impeccable, and the acting skills of the actors are all above average, with nothing particularly unwatchable.</p>
<p>The best actors are Zhao Huishen, who plays Fanyi, and Jiang Ming, who plays Lu Gui. It is particularly commendable that Fanyi, such a difficult character to play, can be played to this extent. It is also very difficult to play Lu Gui so "just right." The actor who plays Sifeng, if he pays more attention to the lines, pays attention to the emotions of each sentence, and does not raise the last two words particularly high, will definitely have better achievements. The actor who plays Lu Dahai lacks a burly figure, his pronunciation lacks grandeur, and it is best not to comb his hair so shiny. The makeup of the actor who plays Lu's mother is a bit less elderly, and it is best to pay more attention to the movements and pronunciation. Zhou Ping is as difficult to play as Fanyi, and he has not grasped his entire personality here. He only performs according to the plot, and although he performs well in this section, he cannot connect with people in the overall impression. The actor who plays Zhou Chong not only has to make people feel that he is silly, but also has to make people feel his purity and innocence, and the beautiful ideals hidden in the depths of his soul. The gentleman now seems to lack some. The actor who plays Zhou Puyuan has enough action, but in terms of speaking, it is best not to drag out the sound of the words too long.</p>
<p>Apart from that, as I said above: lighting, sound effects, and devices have generally reached the point where they are impeccable. Especially in the third act, in the croaking of frogs, lightning, rain, and spring tunes, it makes people feel intimately like they are in a sultry summer night.</p>
<p>The "China Traveling Theatre Troupe," which has struggled for more than two years, has shown that they have not wasted their energy in this achievement. This is very gratifying. While we bless its growth, we hope that it, coming from the rapidly changing North China, can stand more firmly on the forefront of the drama movement, and face reality and the drama movement as a pioneer.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Frog <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>"Ponds give birth to spring green, garden willows chirp with singing birds." The scenery of spring is indeed beautiful. During the day, there are many musicians and singers, playing or singing pleasant music, but at night they all stop playing and singing. Spring nights are lonely, quiet, except for the gentle spring breeze, the ripples of spring water, and the swaying of tree shadows, everything is peaceful and quiet. However, this is not absolute. That is the singing of frogs.</p>
<p>Frogs are lovable little creatures. They hide in a corner of the pond in their green clothes, making it difficult for people to see them. They have round, protruding eyes, like a poet wearing myopia glasses of five or six hundred degrees. Their strong legs are good at jumping. When they are resting in the grass, if you give them a slight shock, they will nimbly jump into the water with a "ge" sound, and then you can only see the splashing waves.</p>
<p>When I was young, I was very familiar with frogs. I used to imprison them with ropes and hurt them with guns, but after entering the city, I became estranged from them and didn't even have the heart to think about them. Last year, I returned to the countryside, listened to cicadas, listened to katydids, and now I hear the singing of frogs again. "Frogs are everywhere in the grassy pond," indeed, there are many, many frogs in spring. But most people hate them because they disturb people's sleep. Also, because their meat is delicious and edible, they often suffer the fate of being caught. I love frogs, but I have also eaten frog meat. That was six or seven years ago. I was in a school in the countryside. The scenery of the school was excellent. The school was surrounded by a large pond. There were especially many frogs in the pond. When we finished our night classes and went to the campus to play and sing, the frogs would respond to us, "Ge ge ge! Yue ge ge!" Rhythmically, they made us feel great pleasure. But when we went to sleep, everyone felt that the frogs were hateful. So one day, we hired five or six fishermen to catch them. In addition to giving them to the fishermen, we had a good dish that we had never had before. It was a large pot of frog meat, which was fresh and fragrant, and the taste was authentic. The students all hoped to eat this good dish again. But at night, when I heard the sparse sound of frogs, I felt sad and repented. Since then, in the countryside and in the city, I have had opportunities to eat frogs, but I have never eaten them, although I know that the taste of frogs is authentic.</p>
<p>Now I hear the sound of frogs again. This wave of repentance is still attacking me. I love frogs. Frogs are optimistic poets. Autumn is the season with the most poets, but it is too sad after all. Mr. Zheng Zhenduo said in "Cicadas and Katydids": "They sing the song of autumn, the song of old age, and the song of farewell. Their songs are like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, the mournful women playing the pipa, lonely and strange, clear and lingering, low and full of sorrow." These are excellent words to describe the poets of autumn. As for the spring poet, the frog, that is not the case. Their voices are spacious and bright. They don't complain about heaven or blame others. They raise their heads and sing, passionately and generously. When they sing alone, they are like a disheveled poet standing in the wilderness, singing his open-minded poems. When a few of them sing together, sparsely, they are like large raindrops falling on umbrella-like lotus leaves. When they sing in groups, it is even better, like the evening tide on the Qiantang River, rolling in. But whether they sing alone, in groups, or in crowds, their hearts are always broad, and they have no sad and declining sounds.</p>
<p>"Ducks are the first to know when the spring river warms up." In fact, the frog's sensitivity is no less than that of a duck. When they immerse their whole bodies in the water, they have long known that the water is warm. All the insects have not yet sung, but the frogs have already sung. Frogs are the praisers and pioneers of spring.</p>
<p>In the evening, when you are leisurely sitting on a chair smoking, when you are lying lonely on the bed thinking, or when you want to write a poem, or when you are tired of talking to your lover, or when you can't bear the sorrow, then, my friend; I advise you to close your eyes, suppress the beating of your heart, and listen to the frogs singing...</p>

<p>Besides wanting to see her son's illness, she originally wanted to fulfill two wishes, which was to find a wife for her son... However, this disappointed her. Her son did not like to marry...</p>

<p>Mr. Ji does not like too old women, nor does he like too new ladies. This is difficult!</p>
<p>During this period, when Mr. Ji recovered from his illness in the hospital, the old lady became sick in the same hospital.</p>
<p>She also became acquainted with Miss Yu, the nurse in the hospital. Because she was sick for a week, her nephew came to see her several times. Did her nephew fall in love with Miss Yu? Therefore, before she returned to the South, she was determined to have this old lady act as a matchmaker.</p>
<p>She really felt strange. Her son, Mr. Ji, was so indifferent to marriage? And her nephew was so anxious, on the contrary.</p>
<p>Beep! Miss Yu is here. What is Miss Yu like! Miss Yu half agreed.</p>
<p>Hey! I won't say: guess what!</p>
<p>Her nephew is so anxious because he is in love with Miss Yu, however, her son, Mr. Ji, is also indifferent because he is in love with Miss Yu.</p>

She is, thinking of the girl, intestines about to break. Can't help but, a burst of sadness, two tears filling. Miss ah, thinking of you, delicate body always carries three points of panting. Wanwan medicine is useless. Although, Baoyu loves each other from a young age. He is, the moon in the water. Only the slave is, diligently caring for the little maid. Desolate and cold, who cares about the feelings. It is often said that red faces have been doomed since ancient times. The epiphyllum blooms for a moment. When, who is outside the window screen? Only the yellow soil is left, burying the jade person in the middle. Miss ah, pity you, a wisp of fragrant soul follows the wind</p>

<p>. The remaining fragrance remains, the cold and cold window is sealed with dust. Thousand lian in front of the window. Several trunks with tear stains. Cold and desolate a Xiaoxiang hall. Lonely fragrant boudoir deep closed door. Listen, the parrot does not care about people haggard. Muttering tongue burial flower sound. Miss, where are you going? Before dying, I told you two or three things. Until now, people are dead and things are here, autumn wind, everything is killing people. The slave is, long nights sleep uneasy. Overlapping sadness until five o'clock. Thinking of people is heartbreaking. In dreams, I don't see your Dongjun. The slave is lonely, living in Rongning mansion. As if, the building is empty and the nest is also tilted. Look, fallen red is full of the ground, no one sweeps. Buried fragrant tomb, who will bury the flower soul.

The sound of pipa on the water is low. The neighbor boat sounds suddenly. Sandalwood grooves play four strings of coolness. But see that. The fingers are hooking, picking, plucking, and playing busy. The sound is sharp. Meaning is vast. A song of pipa tears two lines. Playing to the sad time is like complaining. As if a woman weeps in her room. Miserable. Ape cries at Wuxia broken intestines. Mangcangcang. The ground is full of knives, iron horses bumping. The sound is fine. Crickets wrap around, crying and suing. Rhyme is quiet. Spring sings in deep creeks, bamboo knocks on the window. But see him. Half covering her delicate face, limited. Her fate is to marry a merchant. Heavy profit, light leaving, separate. Several wanderings in his hometown. A sound of cracking silk, the pipa rests. Relatively speechless, a hundred feelings hurt. Lived that. Jiangzhou Sima tears falling.</p>

<p>Shanghai Grand Theater Premieres Tonight at 9:15 PM</p>
<p>The famous British historical event "The Iron Duke" has now been made into a mega-film by the British film giant Gaumont Film Company at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars. The film stars George Arliss, a veteran of the British film industry, playing the leading role in a domestic film for the first time. Due to certain reasons, the film was banned from being screened by the concession authorities. Now, the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road will premiere it on Thursday, April 30, at 9:15 PM as the only theater in this city to show it. The plot of the film is very grand, depicting the historical events of the British general "Wellington" in the "Waterloo" war. It is a rare production in Wusong in recent years, and it is also a special film that only Fangyuan can show publicly. Seating has already begun. It is expected that the traffic on Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road will be heavy, and it will definitely cause a sensation.</p>
<h3 id="e188">"Waves Washing Sand" Miscellaneous Writings <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Seashore, a deserted island, with surging waves washing the sand. After the sea water washes away, two skeletons are imprinted in the sand.</p>
<p>These two skeletons are victims of a conflict of interest. The theme of "Waves Washing Sand" begins with these two skeletons.</p>
<p>"Waves Washing Sand" not only has an extremely tense drama, but also writes about a great tragedy of mankind.</p>
<p>This tragedy will always exist among mankind and will not disappear. People have temporarily joined hands and made peace for their mutual interests, but when it comes to their respective interests, they will immediately turn against each other.</p>
<p>"Waves Washing Sand" is not only exceptionally meaningful in its theme, but also has special success in its portrayal, especially in its psychological depiction, which can be said to be meticulous.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that this is the first sound film of Lianhua, and this sound film can be said to be a real attempt to exert the function of sound film.</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang only established his position in the art world with "The Goddess" and "Little Angel". The emergence of "Waves Washing Sand" is the stage where he achieves his greatest success.</p>

<p>Last year, the Yueming Company seemed to have hopes for great ambitions. It published special issues, raised funds, and made a lot of noise. When "Confusion" was released, it expanded its publicity. At the same time, the scenery films taken from Tibet were also prepared to be compiled into a script called "Panorama of Tibet." However, after not much time, it gradually faded. Finally, the company stopped operating invisibly, and the salaries of the employees were owed for several months, and it has been delayed until now. It seems that it is probably impossible to revive it like the Diantong Company. Moreover, news from reliable sources is that Xia Tianwu, Ren Pengnian's personal secretary, has entrusted lawyer Zhang Yifan to recover his arrears in salary, and other employees will also take similar actions. The outcome is temporarily unknown.</p>
<p>Zhaohua Film Company, which produced a film called "Tears of Remorse," once organized a song and dance troupe to run the docks, but the box office was a disastrous failure. The "Tears of Remorse" was involved in a lawsuit over the issue of transfer.
