<h3>英國外交的戰略（下）</h3>
<p>— 英國Walteros　qleol　虞爾昌作譯</p>
<p>一切已擺在我們的前面了：五條基本原則指道着我們的外交家們怎樣去决定他們的戰略，五種外面的影響使得他們困惑憂疑，五種錯綜複雜的國際關係簡直給他們以致命的打擊。</p>
<p>在已知的國際情勢之下，我們的外交家們將怎樣運用他們的原則，决定他們的戰略呢？他們所决定下來的戰略能保證他們達到預定的目的嗎？他們的戰略的成功或失敗，對於世界的和平與戰爭，反針與　進，將有什麽關係？我們的勞工運動怎樣才能去阻止，約束，並且支配我們那反動的外交部呢？</p>
<p>扶助最脆弱的一環——英國外交戰略的核心</p>
<p>因爲篇幅的限制，我不能把前表所列各種因素對於英國外交戰略的影響，一一加以討論。但從已往所叙述的。讀者常能想像我們的外交大臣和他的手下是在怎梂的一種疑難狀態中了。此外，他們又很明白那自由的和平主義是依然不能被忽視的，那曾受資本主義洗禮的中產階級是永遠把個人的潤利放在國家的前面的；他們更須擔憂着那抱着階級觀念的工人們是隨時可以掀起一個革命運動的。他們將從什麽地方尋得他們的出路呢？</p>
<p>但是他們終於獲得了解救的辦法。他們揭櫫出「保護資本主義」的旗幟，這在有些國家是很動聽的。用這面旗幟，我們的外交家以爲可以去修好於外强中乾的法西國家，獲得它們的贊助，以重　國際的均勢，而保全自己的地位。孤立是不可能的了，應當去獲得援助的勢力。但是（一）這種援助的勢力不可過分强大，以致發生尾大不掉的不受指揮的情形；（二）這種援助勢力之急需英國帮助，而且必要更甚於英國之需要　們的帮助。好了，於是我們的外交家們找得了他們的寳貝　生病的法西國家。看吧，這豈不是再好沒有的把戲嗎：去撫慰一個生病的法西國家；用金錢來飼養它；鼓勵它的佔領慾，雇傭它做自己的衛兵；買得它的感恩之心；用債務來把它縛了過來。但是這把戲也是不容易玩的。美國在上屆的大戰裏，曾略一獻身手，後來那批債務人大抵　他們的債務上滑走了。然而路走已到最後一關，除此之外，也就沒有別的可玩的把戲了。唯有放心玩下去，英帝國或者尙有幾分拒蘇抑美而繼續維持它的領導地位的希望。</p>
<p>我們現在可以看出，一九三六年在我們的外交家們的頭腦中正在形成的政策似乎是這樣的：保護資本主義，而保護資本主義卽是去援助那最脆弱的一環。去援助資本主義裏面最脆弱的國家，採取　樣的策略是有很多的原因的：（一）這些國家是脆弱的，所以很容易地就能把它們拉過來；（二）援救資本主義裏面最脆弱的國家，才是援助世界資本主義使得免於解體，（三）我們需要它們的贊助以維持我們的領導地位；（四）愈是這種國家，兪是有着强大的武力；（五）這些國家是反自由主義的，反社會主義的，反國際主義的，反民主主義的　而我們，英國的統治階級，所害　的便正是自由主義，社會主義，國際主義和民主主義，因爲這些都足以使我們的領導地位失墜的。「分化而統治之」。這是我們的傳統致策的一部分。唯有這樣做去，我們才有希望保持我們的笨重的帝國。我們要做一個「有者損之，無者益之」的俠義的武士。如此，我們才能迭成一　有利於自己的均勢。</p>
<p>英國能達到它的目的嗎</p>
<p>以上是說明英國統治階級的內部正在怎樣形成他們的外交戰略　這戰略雖然還沒有到完全凝固的時期，但大致是不會走樣的了。的確，近來希特勒的演說更着重於殖民地的要求，那結果，曾引起泰晤士報對紐倫堡納粹黨演說的溫和的諷刺。「德　志的領袖們倘使設想這個國度已經準備好和他們合夥去割掉共產主義的腦袋，而使法西主義成爲歐洲之王，那他們眞是十分誤識了不列顚人民的脾胃了」。（九月十四日社論）可是不幸得很，那却正是英國外交政策所指着的方向裡。</p>
<p>但是法西主義成爲「歐洲之王」將拿誰做犧牲品呢？RP杜德在五月號勞工月刊的每日記要裏說：</p>
<p>「希特勒的戰爭計劃是一柄納粹的短劍，它的尖端是對凖着萊茵河以東不論那國人民的心窩的，所以也可以說，是對準着全歐洲以及全世界的和平的。英帝國主義的少數在野的領袖們業已逐漸覺悟，待到希特勒第一期的計劃成功之後，這柄納粹的短劍是行將轉向到大英帝國這一邊來了」。</p>
<p>約翰·斯屈拉乞，（在四月七日的每日工人）說得更爲肯定：</p>
<p>「我以爲這並不是狂悖之論：在這些形勢之下，希特勒　許會把他全部的外交政策轉向過來，與法蘇妥恊，於是突然向抓立的英國提出各種要求，那時，英國倘不承認，便須單獨來一次戰爭。」</p>
<p>自然，我們的政府未嘗不明白　里的危　，但它是吾已經澈底覺悟，準備放棄那犧牲法蘇和其他弱小國家，以滿足德日的野心，而維持自己的地位的夢想呢？我們的政府不會把蘇聯內部的力量估計得太低，而反把希特勒獨裁的强制的力量估計得太高了嗎。我們知道，在目前，希特勒是仍然時刻在想攫得英國的援助的。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>從前面那一番分　，我們所得到的結論是什麽：法西主義的恐怖驅使全世界前進的分子聯合起來了。法國聯合陣綫的第一次的收獲使全歐聽到了消息的人們感着興奮。人們都覺悟到法西主義不但是民主制度的敵人，並且是共同義務，集體安全，以及各種國際和平機構的破壞者。獨裁的國家們正在干涉着弱國的內政，侵佔着弱國的土地，而它們的姣後目標是全世界民主主義的毀滅。爲對付這種危險起見，集體安全與互相協助的辦法是不可缺少的了。保衛民主主義的全世界聯合陣綫顯然已經成立了，布魯塞爾的世界和平大會不是明證嗎？我們的政府到底將站在那一邊呢？自然不會站薛西爾爵士和國際和平陣綫這一邊的。自治領與殖民地决不能和民主與進步混在起的。旣然如此，則除此之外，也就只有獨裁與反動這一條路了。帝國主義總歸是帝國主義。布蘭特福特爵爺曾說過的，「我們並不姑爲印度人民的利益而才去征服印度的。……我們拿刀來征服印度，我們也拿刀來保時印度」。（十月十七日每日新）我們的政府看來是旣經被套好了等頭走上了死硬的道路，卽使要想回頭，恐怕已是做不到了。</p>
<p>在遠東，日本正在著著侵犯着我們在中國的利益。我們呢，也想用修好和賄買來請他們適可而止，但這是可能的嗎？我們的政府在疑惑　，躊躇着，然而沒有堅决的步驟。在這方面，對於民主主義，社會主義，和世界和平的威嚇更是一直存在着的。</p>
<p>在這個國度裏，聯合陣綫的需要，是日見其切迫了</p>

<h3>中日外交之瞻望</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>調整中日邦交。爲今日一般社會最高之呼聲。亦愛好和平民族最切之願望。然自談判開始。於茲亦已數月。匪特諒解未有進步。且見事態益增嚴重。綏東戰事勃發。靑島糾紛繼之。幾使外交談判有無從進行之苦。誠關心東亞大局者所引爲非常遺憾者也。</p>
<p>吾人亦嘗焦心灼慮以思。調整工作之所以終難就緒者。其故安在。試就過去事實所昭示。不難透澈明白其眞相。蓋在我以互尊主權爲原則。在彼以武力威脅爲能事。持此目標。而求接近。則南轅北轍。萬無是處。雖三尺童子。亦知僵局之甚難打開矣。</p>
<p>當張外長與有田大使談判之始。卽已闡明我國保持領土完整之立塲。在此原則之下。首先應予解决者。實爲東北問題。然經有田認爲時機未至以後。張外長亦知此著未易猝辦。爲表示調整邦交之眞實誠意起見。毅然放棄原來之主張。暫置已事於勿論。而唯以設法消滅妨碍冀察內蒙行政完整之狀態爲言。然而此後日方所反映於我過度誠意者如何。其繼續侵略程序之見於事實者又如何。關於我方不能負缺乏誠意之責者。此其一。日方今日所加於我最大之非難。厥惟國民情感之激昂。夫以擁有四萬萬人口之國家。備受歷年來不斷之損害。而使如寒蟬仗馬。不出怨咨之聲。本非甚易之事。政府爲欲保持兩國眞正之和平。不惜予以再三誥誡與取締。人民體念斯意。亦不得不力遏忿奮之情緒。以蘄求事熊之改善。如此和平之民族。實爲舉世所罕見。不幸彼方猶謂未足。隨時投以不良之印象。隨地增進吾民之刺激。以造成無法彌補之反感。激水過顙。責有攸歸。至是雖有力求容忍之政府。亦將失其控御之能力。關於我方已竭盡調整邦交之賣者。此其二。</p>
<p>要之。情勢至此。實堪扼腕。日方果無輕啟釁端之意。誠應先將地方局部事件。擇要予以適度之解决。徐俟世界局勢之推移。再圖整個邦交之改善。若猶昧察我國情况。必欲一意孤行。竟認對華有採取自動政策之可能。如前日三省會議所云云者。則前途險惡變化。將有不堪想像者。須知我國退讓已屆最後之限度。人民皆具堅毅之决心。深缾罍之恥。切墮甑之憂。舉國所底厲磨礱者。亦唯有沉著奮鬥而已。</p>

<p>泰晤士報載稱「國王何所抉擇、吾人自不應加以懸揣、但此項問題、應迅速獲得合理的解决、又國王不論採取何項决定、只須使帝國內部、不致發生更嚴重的紛爭、必爲全國人民所敬謹接受、此在國王、自所瞭解也」云云、</p>

<p>斯丹林演說稱、「、審查委員會工作業已結束、新憲法修正文草案、業已分發大會全體代表、因此、大會廳已深知其內容、審查委員曾引用修正案四十三條、對於原草案中三十二條加以修改、其他一百十四條則仍照原案未動、</p>
<p>「第一爲關於原案第八條之修正案、原案云、『集體農塲佔有土地使用期間、並無限制、卽永遠佔有、』修正條文云、『集體農場佔用士地使用免費、斯間亦無限制、卽永遠佔有、』此項修正意義自明、似無庸解釋、</p>
<p>「第二爲關於第十條之修正、原案云、『公民工作收入·儲蓄·其住宅內及家庭附屬經濟內家用物品及器具、以及個人使用及享樂物件等個人財產、均受法律保護、』修正文云「公民工作收入·儲蓄·其住宅內家庭附屬經濟內家用物品及器具·及個人使用或享樂物件等個人財產所有權、以及公民個人財產遺傳權、均受法律保護、」此項修正意義顯明、似無庸再加解釋、</p>
<p>「第三修正案爲關於第三十五條者、此案原文云、民族院由各聯邦共和國及自治共和國最高議院及各自治省勤勞者代表·蘇維埃推選代表·組織之、內每聯邦共和國選派代表十人、每自治共和國派代表五人、每自治省派代表二人、」修正文云、「民族院由各聯邦及自治共和國·各自治省·及各民族區蘇聯公民、普選代表組成之、每聯邦共和國舉代表廿五人、每自治共和國舉代表十一人、每自治省舉代表五人、每民族區舉代表一人、」由此、此條已完全適合兩院人數相等、及同用民治方法組成之平等原則、</p>
<p>「第四爲關於第四十條之修正、此條原案云、「蘇聯最高議院通過之法律、由最高議院主席及主席團書記簽字公佈、」修正文云、「蘇聯最高議院通過之法律、用各聯邦共和國文字由最高議院主席及主席團書記簽字公佈、」此修正意義明白、似勿庸解釋、由此一切法律將用十一種文字公佈、</p>
<p>「第五爲關於第四十八條之修正、原案規定最高議院設副主席四人、修正案改爲副主席十一人、卽與聯邦共和國數相等、</p>
<p>「第六爲關於第七十七條之修正、其中建議於現有之全聯邦各人民委員會外、增設人民國防工業委員會、此項修正勿庸解釋、</p>
<p>「最後之修正案爲關於第四十九條癸欵者、原案云、「最高議院休會期間內、如蘇聯受武力攻擊、由主席團宣佈戰爭、」修正文云、「蘇聯最高議院休會期內、如蘇聯遭武力攻擊、或遇有執行國際互助抵抗侵略條約義務之必要時、由主席團宣佈戰爭、」（猛烈鼓掌）按此條係受法國抗議而修正者、）</p>
<p>「其他之修正並無本質上之重要性、純係辭句性質、似不必詳加分析」、</p>
<p>斯丹林君演說畢、由主席安德萊也夫君將憲法逐條讀出、付諸表决、共歷一小時餘、各條均經一致通過、間以鼓掌聲、逐條通過之後、主席復將全文總付表决、結果全塲一致通過、</p>

<p>嗣後、大會卽命令蘇聯中執會根據新憲法、致定並批准蘇聯最高議院選舉條例及選舉程序、大會復决議爲紀念新憲法起見、十二月五日應定爲國慶日、於是此討論並通過新憲法之歷史的大會、乃於重起之祝賀斯丹林及各黨政領袖喝采聲中閉幕、新憲法卽日發生效力、（五日塔斯社電）</p>

<p>蟹之種類，隨地而異，而吾邑嘉定產量雖不多，然自春阻夏，以至深秋，陳列於市，可謂無日無之，不過多寡之分而已。顧蟹汛亦有遲早，城之東北較先，不矣朔風之起，而已上市，恒在中秋前後，漁家俱爭先捕捉矣。唯斯時之蟹，甫經蛻殼，其身形似頭大，而肉未充足，遣論膏液，眞有持鰲之癖者，么不顧惜之，以爲達此「九月團臍十月尖」之時令，有負橫行介士之盛名也。西門水源，來自漳浦，河闊而淸，故蟹入市較晚，然其物亦必堅老，蓋其時總在橙黃菊綻，登高舒嘯之際，所謂「西風響，蟹脚硬，」良不誣耳。特產自城南戳浜鄉者爲最佳，以其時上斷者，雖較落後，而無不豐腴。尤奇者，鄉之南爲公孫涇，則其蟹背有一「工」字，鄉之東爲楊涇，則其蟹背有一「王」字，隱的可辨，且其體略大，而鱉足略小，其味亦更精美無比。人鍋煮時，試以他處之蟹入其中，預作誌別，至啟蓋觀之，「工」字與「王」字者必在上，否則在下，百不爽一，可知結實者能掙扎，而中空者，經熱卽死，其優劣自見也。考其原四，戳洪河水，在鹹淡之間，是以蟹之分量，每隻雄者，尙不滿斤，而殻薄肉厚，無一種魚腥之氣，允推獨步。惜市上不多見，卽有之，亦以贗品胃之，識者不爲所欺，欲購者有至鄉中，向漁戶預定，雖值略高，所不吝也。故目前公孫涇楊涇，兩岸蕭蕭蘆葦叢中，漁火明滅，小小茅屋，不帝深溝高壘，以俟無腸公子之陷入而縛之，然後獻俘於一般老饕之前焉。</p>
<h3>橘話</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>齊晏子言：「橋逾淮，化為積，」屈原的橋頸道：「后皇嘉樹，橘徠服兮，受命不遠，生南國兮，」可見橘的受人珍視，由來已古。到了漢武帝時，特在交趾設「橘官，」秩二百石，專負進貢御橘之責，這也是橘的一頁光榮史。自此之後，橘便做了詩人們諷詠的對象，如：「書後欲題三百顆，洞庭須待滿林霜，」「江南有且橘，經冬猶樹林，」「山中奴隸橘千頭」等，不能盡憶了。</p>
<p>橘爲常綠灌木，在植物學上屬芸香料，夏開五瓣白花，初冬結實，作扁圓狀，色靑，霜降以後，轉成紅色或黃色，才可供人啖食。自從海禁大開？便增進我們不少啖橘的口福，單以上海而言：除了產自福州的「福橘」外，又有廣州運來的「廣橘」暹羅運來的一蜜橘；」而自蜜橘侵入了國內市塲，福橘廣橘等便都相形見組。十餘年前書家天台山農在天台山種橘千頭，號爲「天台蜜橘，」因爲橘味的鮮美，又經塾林的品評，所以銷路很佳，可惜山農正擬推廣，便歸道山，橘田遂告荒蕪；幸台屬人民，已因此而知種橘的利益，紛紛栽植，所以台州蜜橘，仍佔上海果品市塲的一席地，而與暹羅蜜橘爭勝。那末我們在啖台州蜜橘時，倒也不能忘掉山農的首創之功。　我國產橘之區，除了以上各地外，尙有江西南豐縣產的「南豐橘，」和洞庭東西兩山產的「洞庭紅，」也都是橘中雋品。南豐橘據聞允以郭背園產的爲最佳，大小和洞庭紅相等。現在南豐郭背園農民，已組織運銷合作社，改良運銷外埠的方式，上海人士，也儘可以噹到了。</p>
<p>美國產的所謂「花旗蜜橘，」四季都有，因爲用的是科學的儲藏和栽培法，這大足以打破逾淮化枳的話，科學萬能，還容懷疑嗎？</p>
<p>屈原橘頌又有一節說：「深固難徙，更查志兮，綠葉素榮，紛其可喜兮，曾枝剡棘，園果搏兮，靑黃雜糅，文章爛兮，精色內白，類可任道兮，紛緼宜修，姱而不醜兮。」道是屈原拿橘格來象徵自己的人格，說是有堅定的志氣，絢爛的文章，美好的本質。現在正需要人格救國，那末我們在啖橘之時，對於自己的人格方面，不能不加一番注意，莫要人不如橘才好。</p>
<h3>增城的荔枝乾</h3>
<p>— 礎楣</p>
<p>荔枝，爲嶺南名產，增城的掛綠荔枝，、在從前專制時代是作爲貢品的，每歲果熟，由增城令獻呈皇室，平民就難得嘗到這雋味了，所謂掛綠，言其荔仁上有綠絲綫條，宛似懸繪似的，這一點就所以異於尋常了。無怪蘇東坡有「日啖荔枝三百顆，不辭長作嶺南人」之句哩，坡老所食，卽爲增城產物，其推重有如此者。</p>
<p>唐楊太眞，患口臭，百藥醫治罔效，御醫以嶺南荔枝可解此疾，白明皇，皇遂馳詔，驛丞以千里馬趕送，貴妃食後，果吹氣如蘭，嗣乃珍貢不絕。</p>
<p>筆者籍隸南中，每當荔枝應市，必日飽一頓以爲常，來滬以後，卽未能嘗到，蓋鮮荔枝運滬，已皮敗肉腐，食之足以患病，市上有荔枝乾，多用火烘，質乾味變，頗少當意了。</p>
<p>一昨偕友人晚餐於靜安寺旁味林酒家，見有鮮滓荔枝乾陳列，購而嘗試，的是佳品，據該公司職員林君語我，謂此項荔枝乾，確為粵中增城產品，其戚屬某，鄉營商於增城，每於荔技上市時，必出高價搜羅上品，完全用生晒法以日光之力晒乾，本味及功效，得以保存，往年運銷南美洲，有求過於供之勢，今歲以前欵積欠過巨，遂停止運美，林君聞訊，特去函促其戚友，全批運來海上，以饗滬上人士云，余以無意中大飽口福，乃訂購若千，分貽親友，莫不譽爲妙品也。</p>
<h3>海門茅鎮的羊肉</h3>
<p>— 顥顥</p>
<p>海門羊肉是素來著名於世的，允以茅鎭的羊肉別有風味，讀者們讀了這篇文字後，就算是「過屠門而大嚼」過些癮罷。</p>
<p>海門是江北的一個中等縣治，和號稱東方巴黎的上海，雖僅隔着一衣帶水，可是風俗却異常醇厚，並未染上奢華之風。茅鎭是海門的一個大鎭商業繁盛，在棉花汛裏，一般肩挑棉花來鎭的鄉販，他們大都喜歡喝一杯酒，於是羊肉酒館便應時而興了。全鎭的羊肉館，從前最著名的一家，要算是「施六九」，他的羊肉烹調得法，沒有絲毫腥羶的氣息，羊肉的煮法，分「紅燒」「白肉」「淸燉」，有的是和綫粉同煮的，有的是和粢飯同蒸的，羊肉最名歲的，當然是「腿筒」的一種了，烹熟之後，放些胡椒末，蘸些甜醬，再加上些胡葱屑，其味極妙。</p>
<p>茅鎭的羊肉館，分有兩種階級，一種是中下階級去吃的，還有一種却是那些公子哥兒和留着八字鬚的紳士老爺們專享的，代價以腿筒爲較昂，但也只需兩三毛錢，便能大快朶頤，在那般有產階級的老饕們，這區區的數目，似乎算不了一回事。</p>
<p>茅鎭上的羊肉館，自從「施六九」死去後，接踵而起的，也開了十幾爿，現在最出名的，要輪到「羊肉西施」一家了，西施是一位老闆娘，花信年華，出落得風流俊俏，同時伊烹調羊肉的本領，的確勝人一籌，有了這別饒風味的羊肉，再加上了一塊「文君當鑪」的活招牌，母怪門庭若市了。</p>
<h3>冬季滋補的食物</h3>
<p>— 承明</p>
<p>光陰過得真快，那嚴寒季節的冬天，已經又到了。勞勞碌碌的大眾，一到了冬季這三個月裡頭，大都要進些滋補身體的補劑。（苦力勞工及貧苦人家除外）有錢的人，當然吃些人參，燕窩，膏滋藥等補品，調養身體，接濟精力的不足。普通階級的人們，雖然沒有進些人參補劑的能力，但也須進些牛乳荳乳鷄蛋等普通滋養料。除此之外，又有幾種宜於冬季滋補的食物，且價値低廉適合於普通人家，茲將製法寫在下面。</p>
<p>黃茋燒羊肉　黃茋燒羊肉，旣可下酒，又可佐膳，筆者每至冬季，必親自烹煮，已有六七年經騐，確有滋補身體，堤起精神之功效，共計只費法幣二元。這個法兒，係已故畫家吳逃禪先生所指授的，筆者如法泡製，連年「冬季」煮食，並無其他補劑進服，身體强健非常，且無任何疾病發生，閱報諸君，不妨一試之。「製法」用上等黃茋數兩的一元，（各藥材店均有出售）鮮肥羊腿一方的計三四斤其價一元之數，將黃茋用銅鍋火爐煎煮，加淸水三四碗，的一二小時，俟其藥汁濃時，將湯汁瀝出，再加淸水煎煮，須煎四决，將藥汁和羊肉共煮，再加薑片，紅棗，紹酒，氷糖，醬油，及茴香少許宜淡不宜鹹，俟其爛熟，然後起鍋，每日冷食熱食均可，各依胃口大小，適可而止，其味非常鮮美而不覺着藥氣。</p>
<p>參羊　羊肉一物，略帶滋補，是人人知道的，所以在冬季的羊肉，也是滋養料豐富食物之一，最好用有刺海參，置淸水中浸三四天，然後洗凈淸潔，（菜攤上的水海參，因水分太多，且甚軟薄，已失其功用）和入煮熟的紅燒羊肉中烹之，其味鮮美無比。</p>
<p>燜牛肉　用鮮嫩牛肉，五六斤，置於沙鍋中，加薑酒醬油淸鹽等物，用文火炭結爐，燜七八小時，則非常爛熟，其脂肪汁，都在湯滷之中，如不喜吃牛肉的話，只吃湯汁，也非常滋補。</p>
<p>嫩童鷄　嫩童鷄，須用雌鷄，最好不用鐵器宰割，用碗爿割其喉管，俟其血出淸，置於沙鍋中，隔水再置飯鍋中燜爛，的一二小時取出，其味非常可口。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　惡耗驚聞人如花落溷　芳踪頻到心是絮沾泥</p>
<p>國器聽到他這話，倒有些愕然，你不是讓人寫信通知我，約了今天來的嗎！但是也不說明，向他回點一個頭道：天熱，沒有出去。剛才聽到李小姐來了，我就恭候着在這裡。友梅覺得他今天的話，已經比往日活動得多，居然肯站着同女賓說上許多客氣話了。站在屋中，向四週的書架子看了看，笑道：聽說表哥又貿了好些書。國器笑道：提到書，那可笑得很，連手邊應用的書，我都不够的。請坐請坐。友梅笑道：表哥留我在迄屋子裏坐，這是殊榮呀。你讀書作文的地方，是很不容易招待來賓的。國器道：言重言重。說着，在他斜對面一張小椅上坐了。友梅坐在書架側面一隻白磁凉墩上，將右手的食指，慢慢撫着臉腮，對了書架子上的書，作個凝神的樣子。國器道：李小姐你要什麽書。友梅道：青哥爲什麼這樣客氣？你就不肯呌一聲表妹，呌我一聲友梅也可以。國器笑道：李小姐爲人豪爽說起話來是這樣的痛快。說完了這句話他父覺得語塞了，只好親自起身斟了一杯茶，送到他手上。友梅起身接過茶，道了謝，坐下去慢慢兒的呷着，先是向國器微笑着，然後正了顏色道：表哥，的天送給你的那一對信，裏面有什麼東西嗎？國器也正了顏色答道：是有一枚金戒指。本來現在我們是共和國民，男女平等，交際公開，這事也用不着隱瞞。但是各人的家庭狀况不同，我不能胡說。我同那位江小姐，僅僅是通過錢對書信。我認爲他是我的作品一個極忠實的讀者。不過作文章發表的人，能得着忠實的讀者，那也就無異於古人所謂高山流水的知音。所以我對於江小姐也只有談到感恩知己這一點點。友梅聽他說話時只是把茶慢慢呷着。雖是把這杯茶全喝完了，還是將杯子捏在手裏，作個要喝之勢。最後便道：這一層，夢蘭也和我提到過的。他不但是中國書最得多，就是英文書也看得非常流利，他有個不醉心自由的嗎？只是他的身世，和我們不同，自小兒就帶上了一把鎖練。國器聽到這話，便是猛可的一驚，立刻身子向上挺，對友梅望着。（一〇七）</p>
<h3>金華的火腿</h3>
<p>— 劍塵</p>
<p>我國慣例，凡逢佳節良辰及親友來往時，必餽贈禮物以表敬意。在許多禮物中，要算金華火腿爲最上品。此風盛於淸初，據周處風土記上會有如下之記載：』送禮之風，由來已久，惟至國初最爲盛行，至於禮物以浙江之金華火腿爲最上品，王公貴胄無不酷愛之。故國初滿人遇貴客登堂或宴會時，必先烹以名茶，切以腿片，以示敬意。『可見金華火腿在當時受人之歡迎矣。</p>
<p>至於吾國產火腿之區，最著者有金華。雲南兩處，雲省因偏處西南，交通阻梗，故出品運銷各地者不多，金華則不同，因交通之便利及出品之精良，故出品風行全國，執腿業之牛耳金華，在浙江中部，稍偏西南：錢塘江由蘭谿流經該地，水路交通頗爲便利，近年公路築成，陸上交通亦不似昔日之艱難。金華舊屬八縣，有六縣（金華·東陽·義烏·浦江·永康。蘭谿，）皆產火腿，其總產額年的千三百件（每件二百十斤），內以東陽之產額爲最多，年的七千件，其决則爲永康義烏等縣。</p>
<p>火腿名稱甚多，有南腿·北腿·茶腿等，其中應推茶腿爲最上品，此物乃東陽（茶腿並非金華所產，而向被人稱爲金華茶腿者，實因在淸時東陽乃金華之屬縣也。）上蔣一村所產（故又名蔣腿），淸初浙江鉅紳胡雪岩喜食，嗣後浙之官吏爭購此物，作爲夤緣之媒介，美其名曰茶腿：於是各商舖亦大書特書，至今茶腿之名，聞於中外。</p>
<p>茶腿產量不多，年的三百餘件，價比南腿等每件的貴二三十元不等。經營腿業者，除進一·三等貨外，亦進茶腿若干件，以備識貨者採購之用。杭州胡恒昌銷路較大，故所進亦較多，但日常所銷者，仍以二·三等貨爲主體，價較廉，質亦不甚劣，祇是稍少鮮味罷了。製造火腿之法，亦甚簡單，卽先選擇優良之猪腿，加以洗滌，再以鹽醃之，儲亦半月，出缸後其味甚鹹，宜稍拔其鹹氣，方可暴之於日中，故名曰火腿。至於茶腿之製法，卽以猪腿入缸醃時，可浸以濃茶汁，半月後卽可取出曬於烈日下，則其肉紅潤可愛，其味亦鮮美可口　專製茶腿業者，初名曰雪舫，至今用此名者已不可計數，有如上海之陸稿薦與蘇州之野荸薺。</p>
<p>製造火腿雖易，欲保存其味經久不變却難！因火腿雖已醃過，可較其他淡味之物持久，但此物性忌潮濕，稍受侵及，味卽改變，故於黃霉天應將火腿露於有風無雨處，若天晴最好曬於日光之下，則不致受濕而損壞。</p>
<p>故欲火腿之味佳，除選擇優良猪種飼養合宜外，還須注意保存適當，使其味能經久不變。　近年來火腿業之狀况，因受國內商業不景氣之影響，故營業亦大見消减，以杭州一埠論，在二十年前年可銷售七八千件，近年來祗有三四千件，祗及往日之半數，若遇國內重大災禍時，恐比此數還要减少哩！</p>

<h3>糧食　多方抵顧吸收　標粉漲勢奇特</h3>
<p>—各月份俱漲一角限度—</p>
<p>昨日麵粉上午間盤後、各月份市面、又呈奇特之漲風、以洋麥報價、祇見微落一角左右、至於國內實銷、亦無特殊之需要、惟投機依然勃興、漫無底止、而交易所之空頭籌碼、非廠方套售、業外均已退避三舍、故多頭注其全力、吸買不已、遂又造成空前高漲、市塲亦因漲到一角被迫停頓矣，當十午初開、計近期漲二三分、遠期漲四五分、後因買氣甚在、步步高抬、故又漲三四分、迨至下午開盤、因多頭開價卽抬、各月份均已挺足一角之限度、其時雖廠方出售六七萬包、正如杯水車薪仍不能衝住買方之氣燄、照此情形、如當局再不切實糾正、民食前途、將受莫大之影響也、</p>

<h3>證劵公債市氣平凡異常</h3>
<p>高低相差在一二角間</p>
<p>昨日華商證券交易所、公債市塲、形勢愈呈呆滯、市况變動亦極平凡、蓋時局混沌、人氣益見渙散、大戶進出極爲缺乏、卽散戶交易、亦形减少、全日行市之高低比較、不出一二角、成交亦見寥落、如是之淸淡現象、殊爲少有、而市價上落、愈見平疲、於盤旋狀態中、趨勢尙不易開展也、昨日行市之經過、僅上午開盤、爲散戶較多賣出、及七十七·三十五號等拋賣稍見踴躍、市價一致下挫一二三角、餘三盤交易、極爲呆定、每戶祗以三五萬之籌碼供求、卽可操施其市况之升降、而市價亦祇角許之參差、賣買大戶以五·五十·七十二號較有吸收、十四·三十五號則有賣出、然爲所亦有限、全日結果、一致微小五分至二角、成交總數、計三百八十七萬元、茲將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>油市　柏油出新之後　麻城重荊漲猶難鬆　蘭油雖平而水氣重　禾本價高僅以應急</h3>
<p>柏油自陳貨被洋莊到處搜羅後、各地均已售罄、新油雖亦登塲方但未見旺、以致新陳不接而吿中斷者、已半月有餘、現雖產數漸旺、然燭淘用度、亦已開始、故漢滬兩地市塲上依然到不敷銷遠甚、漢市惟麻城油每日到有七八十至百件爲度、若以銷塲而論、縱有二三千件到下、恐亦不敷分派、到銷相離若是之巨、不知何日始有寬舒之望、距此五穴年前、重荊漲至四十餘元、市塲上亦無此種景象、雖新陳不繼、亦有恒有、但時間斷無此次之長、近”漢市所到麻城油、均隨到由各帮號供裝、將來開盤、恐非每擔二十元不可矣、重荊已開至每砠二十一元八角、合到滬市已在二十四元五六角、目勢在卽漲、能有派到數十件、已屬萬分面子、故本埠行家已議售二十五元五角、最低限度、亦須二十五元矣、麻城油亦須二十三元五六角、然因到不敷銷、總屬非常居奇、惟聞浙東金蘭等處、每日可出二百外件、前者拋出之油已將决第解齊、現油已稍有餘積、市面亦漸趨和平、加一砠已稍鬆至二十三元蘭交、然因新油水氣難免、與荊油合算、仍似校昂、滬上需貨雖殷、但依然觀望耳、浙西之禾本汕、每擔須二十五元以上、價格最高、縱有少數交易、爲屬應急而已、更不足以正市論也、且該處年令奇欠、新油成本、須在二十六七元、故現在所售、尙祇陳油、且聞陳油存數較本年所產之新油從額爲多、因新油所產僅及上年十成之一、由是該產地屯積而居奇者比比然也、</p>
<h3>出口桐油提煉　提煉八角出貨迅速　漢口現油價又升漲</h3>
<p>白桐油洋莊去路、漢市向來終年不絕、而數量多寡、無一定時間、今庚自出新迄今、季秋時僅辦少數現油、對於期貨十一月份數尙不多、以十二月一月兩月間數量稍巨、故十月份出口甚屬寥寥、上月間恐亦不及二千噸、大概本月份始可見旺矣、惟因本年秋水不發、又値冬晴、致長江水量、上游淺涸特甚爲數十年來所未有、所有四川鄂西各產地之油、竟至不能出運、湘省常德一路、亦因水淺僅少數可裝、且甚遲滯、故漢市之來源因之異常寥落、當此隆冬、衡以往例、正値旺產、市面亦在鬆跌之時、但到貨凋零若此、欲跌已無可能、幸各洋行所取現油均是數十噸之少數、價格得不致突漲、否則市面不知如何變化矣、但前拋之期油、解期已决第將屆、在售者或已補進抵解、倘來貨脫期、臨時現油勢必受軋也、現在各洋行所辦期油、以二三月居多、價格每担四十八元五角至四十八元二角均毛盤洋規陸續交易、數亦不少、惟據昨日本埠接到漢電、謂現油已加售至五十元矣、於此可見現油之缺俏也、本埠自實業部植物油類廠成立後、出口之油、均須由該廠提煉、現已開始工作、本市經營出口貿易各油商、亦與該廠接洽妥當、故近日所到之油、均已送交該廠收管、據出貨甚爲迅速、每相煉費計國幣八角、較從前自煉、須加增倍蓰、在油商亦無可如何也、而油驗對外貿易、統制之基礎已成、察其形勢、不久尙有更進一步之股施也、</p>
<h3>大連步昂　豆油再漲三角</h3>
<p>昨日荳油市况、因環境依然一再跟蹤大連激昂、昨市再度緊漲三角、大勢雖未達尖銳、但共漲風已頗可觀、全市做開各油七百五十餘件、花生油來源見接、號盤轉鬆成交三千四百餘件、行情平定、</p>
<h3>絲茶　印莊絲銷特盛　輯里絲供不敷求</h3>
<p>昨日橫濱絲市續見回小、現貨跌一〇元、期貨跌一九元、美國無市、白廠美法絲銷仍屬沉悶、數日來頗少開展、印莊絲銷特盛、昨日成交較夥、行盤至爲堅挺、申埠存貨、如輯里絲等均不足應市、簽來各內地在趕裝運滬中、刻金鳥等級售六一五元、較上週末又漲五元、其他絲品、亦隨升頗勁、用戶絲昨售開四十五包、市價呆鈍、僅二三元上落、故交易亦微、</p>
<h3>南北貨徐魁子產區價昂</h3>
<p>—有西安帮勸辦—</p>
<p>黑瓜子近以到存不多、故現在雖値去胃未旺、但市價反見上企、號盤提莊子開二十一元八角、徐魁子二十一元二角、同時產便更爲緊秀、又據客戶快訊，現下徐地存底極薄、近日並有西安帮動採、如提莊子劃申須二十四元半、徐魁子亦需二十三元、與申市相較、倒懸二元之譜、</p>
<h3>糖市　國產棉赤軋缺抬漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市穩定、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨二十一元五角半、稍有劃出、比升二分半、轉口貨呌六元一角二分、比升二分、東白四八九號、現貨及轉口貨均乏上落、本廠綿白亦持原價、號貨有潮帮開出綿赤三十餘包、因値到存均缺、抬漲三四角、以十五元六角成交、</p>
<p>合組公司昨爲本週第一次標兌粵糖之期、計總定額爲一萬一千四百餘包、標價不動、當售出順德廠五羊粗白九百二十包、二十一元三角、市新又二百七十包、二十一元一角汕頭又十包、二十元九角、</p>

<h3>救護綏遠前綫將士之急切需要（上）</h3>
<p>——龐京周博士講——　江晦鳴記</p>
<p>記者前言</p>
<p>龐京周先生，方自新大陸遊學歸來，適逢綏遠的狼烟，如烽火而起；在人人關懷民族生存的前錢，龐先生曾和海上熱心救國的社會領導人物，飛到前錢去實地觀察，並代表上海市民衆，親向最前錢的將士慰勞。報紙上揭載這消息，怕的誰也知道很詳細了。</p>
<p>不過，在醫言醫，我們所要急切了解的，便是前方的救護情形，應有怎麼樣一個需要？這問題的重大，不僅是全國的醫藥界人士所關懷；抑且全中國民衆亦所急切懷望的。記者爲了這個問題急於了解，乃於龐先生赴北平的前一日—十二月一日，邀請至中西電臺民衆醫藥講座中，公開作一决說明，承龐先生允許了我們的要求，從他百忙的時間中，作了一决極扼要的演講，聽衆中必已十分明晰：茲爲轉吿全國人士研究起見；爰將龐先生講辭中關於救護諸點，錄登本刊，俾吾醫藥兩界人士，能於此時有個通盤的訐劃和凖備，以適應前綫的急切需要。</p>
<p>一　綏遠歸來的一般概念</p>
<p>國家危如纍卵，非抗戰不足以圖存，在國防前綫上每一位要員中，幾乎成了每人的中心信念，每位作戰的將士，都是深明大義的男兒，精神上的流露那忠勇的心情，眞是奔放無覊，令人有說不出的興奮和樂觀。</p>
<p>此行，最大的目的，一方面固然是慰勞；另一方面，本人受了紅十字會的託付，和顏福慶先生去履勘當地的情形，計劃救護工作。我們多了這一重使命，所以我們到綏遠的目光，還有關於綏遠救護工作之設計。</p>
<p>那兒，救謎的機關，實在太貧乏了，除了比較完善的一所比國醫院，其餘寥落可數，雖然，山西閻百川先生，曾命當地川至醫院當局計劃綏戰的的救護；但需要我們後方援助補充的地方却很多。</p>
<p>大家都知道，北方人有的是北方勁兒，尤其是綏遠，有些地方眞是一望無垠的沙漠，四野毫無人烟，不知走盡幾里路才得到一個村落，在這情形之下，救護隊的設置處所，也很難與前綫將士取得密切的呼應。幸而，北方的健兒，他們有的是剛毅果敢的精神，他們有了輕傷小創，他們絕不願偸閑稍息，他們撕毀了他們的衣物，他們個自兒包紮了傷處，他們仍要朝前拚命的！我們知道，在醫藥上吿訴我們，不管是那一種的創傷，少不了要嚴密消毒，和着適應症候的包紥，才比較安全的。可是，前方的健兒們，他們所遭遇的創傷，沒有消毒的藥品塗布，也沒有消毒的紗布，绷帶……供他們包紮；他們所用爲裏創的工具，祗是靠了身上的衣帶，在那飛沙蔽日，滿身濺汚了的衣帶，任它包紮創口，這有多麼大的危險一回事呢？不說別的吧，單說破傷風菌，每在泥士中生存着的，萬一泥十濺在的衣帶，正有破傷風菌寄跡，這輕創變成傷害生命的重症，那是不言可喩了！</p>
<p>所以，我們從這一方面觀察，就得到一個明確地概念：我們認爲前方將士的忠勇，是超乎尋常；前方將士的危險，也是超乎尋常！他們不僅時刻在提防着敵人的傷害；同時，他們僥倖過了小的傷害，還不知已隱藏着如何重大的危機，他們寳貴的生命，，豈容我們不設法愛護？</p>
<p>二　目前前綫最需要的簡易急救法</p>
<p>我們認淸前錢的環境，明瞭了前綫將士的精神和痛苦，我們要怎樣設法去救護呢？當本人在歸程中卽和顏福慶先生等商酌，大家都以爲惟有供應一種急救藥包。在綏戰的現程中，固然很需要完備的救護組織和救護人才：但，事實上還不能盡其什一的。北方的健兒，那種不平凡的剛強的個性，從不把輕傷放在眼中的，所以，很需要設計一種簡易救急藥包，每個人給他們隨身帶一個，那比較他們用衣帶來包紮創傷，自然又合理而又安全。</p>
<p>當下我們這種計議，回到上海來，交到上海方面的救護公團中討論，極承大家同情，而藥界人士，並願擔任承製十萬組，這眞令人說不出欣喜的一件事。至於救念藥包所準備的東西，的爲下面幾種。</p>
<p>稀碘酒一小瓶　海碘紡紗布一塊　昇汞紗布一塊　绷帶一捲</p>
<p>絆創膏一小捲　三角巾一塊　安全針兩隻　止痛片兩粒</p>
<p>大概這急救藥包的藥品和用具，便是這幾種。不過，我們的原議是拿這些用品，放在一個紙袋中，外面印上說明書，但恐携帶不便，或易破碎，所以擬决用香烟罐頭，內貯藥品，外繫繩索，並黏以說明書，可以供將士們隨身掛在皮帶上，而便於應用，且能保持罐內的消毒。</p>
<p>我說到這裏，我又想起一句話，任何一件事都需要「因時制宜，大概是不會錯到那裏的。（未完）</p>
<h3>中國明日之護士職業建設問題（下）</h3>
<p>— 李令棟</p>
<p>所以，我們對於看謎生實習問題，將各種功課在二年訓練以後最後一年或是半年，完全再走到病房去做實習的工作，庶可謎生服務精神上及身體健康上都有良好的效果，適合敎育人才的宗旨，但是日常所敎的課程，應以「理論」與「實習」並重爲標準，一味的在書本上紙上談兵，那也等於「空谷傳聲」之形勢，應該有實習敎室之設立，以資實習，若過偏重實習，不了解理論，也是造成」學徒式」之變形，深望護士界對於護生實習問題不可再忽略了它！</p>
<p>關於國文一科，應以應用文爲主體，俾可服務社會時能合適際應用，所以往往一個護土，對於社會間的通函，慰問，呈文，佈吿，報吿……等，自己莫明其妙，不知從何着手寫起，這整個由於在學校時未有相當練習之表現，以後對於國文一科，切不能專以攻讀古文名家作品爲主。</p>
<p>理化一科，我們認爲有增添之必要，因為護士工作常域內理化科興其關保頗密切，日常生活所遇到的，皆是在科學醫藥的圈子裏，假如我們對於理化毫無學識根基，何能領悟醫藥治療與診斷的原理，理化科爲醫藥學之母，也就是護士學之基磋，因爲我們不能否認理化學是醫藥學之母，那不是也不能反對是護士學之基礎，理化學在護士課程上應該是一種必修的主要科目，才對。</p>
<p>第五，護士集中訓練，爲將舊生活改爲新生活的原動力。</p>
<p>我們儘管計劃明日護士敎育改革完善，而忘掉現在已經畢了業的九千餘的護士，不加以訓練，對於革新明日護士敎育，定然發生很大的三力，因爲這九千多的護士，是未曾受過新敎育的洗禮，他們的思想是頑固的，工作技術是固步自封的，同時他們在護士學校中醫院中，社會中，總是佔着領袖的地位，對於新敎育思潮，是未能明暸，管理學生的制度，仍然是學徒的方法，你想，居於領導是如此的情形，明日護士敎育的推動，不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>我們如果將這九千多的謎士，加以新謎士敎育的訓練，將其舊生活改爲新的生活，可以使護士敎育推進的「阻力」，而一變爲推動護士敎育的「助力」，由此可知，訓練過去的謎士，是一件刻不容緩的事體。</p>
<p>我們怎樣去訓練，以不妨碍原服務機關工作和短期內能普及訓練爲原則，每决訓練時問爲六個月，全國分三十處，每處招收五十名，僅需三年，卽可使九千多的護士，够够皆得受新護士敎育的訓練，同時如一醫院內有謎士三人，半年僅須一人去受訓，對其本身所負擔之工作，亦不甚妨碍的啊。</p>
<p>第六，「訓」敎」並施，爲尋求謎士事業發展之本源。</p>
<p>「訓」「敎」合一在現代敎育思潮，已有巨大的震駭，過去祗知在學識上發展，對於品格的訓導，是不十分注意，結果造成學生們的輕浮，虛榮，驕奢淫佚，精神渙散，多得受知識反而多帮助他壞事的本領，貽害社會，做入類害羣之馬，所以今日敎育界都認爲「訓育」的重要不亞於「敎」，因而「訓」「敎」的設施，全國敎育界不遺餘力的提倡。</p>
<p>護士敎育對於『「訓」「敎」合一』的實施更有比其他職業迫切刻不容緩之需要，護士學校中的學生，與其他學校又有不同，是要脚踏實地走到病室去工作，病房就是社會的一部分的縮影，與社會接觸非常的靠近，因由個人學識欠缺，品格不良，可以影響整個醫院的名譽，牽動整個學校的前途，故今日護士敎育之訓「敎」並施，焉能漠然視之乎？結論</p>
<p>總合這上面幾種建築中國護士事業的意見，如果確實能做起來，只須經過三年以後，中國護士事業决能興盛起來，護士職業雖發源於南丁格爾女士，奠立護士事業成立學校化，還歸功我中華護士界，做世界護士事業之標榜，爭得國家一席之光輝，願我中華醫藥界護士界同志勉之。</p>
<h3>手帕吐痰</h3>
<p>— 宋恪三</p>
<p>祗要細心觀察，國人盲從外人的譽動，隨時隨地的可以看出來。高跟皮鞋，束胸，露膝等等不衛生的習慣，試問那一件不是從外人學得來的呢？但是這些習慣，僅有礙於自己身體的健康，與他人無涉。最有害於公共衛生的，要算手帕吐痰了！</p>
<p>滿地吐痰，是中國人的惡習，曾紀李鴻章氏出使外洋時，因爲在輪船上隨地吐痰，至爲外人所鄙視，留下了國際上不可磨滅的汚點，從此以後，中國人對于吐痰一事，漸漸的知道不衛生了！又因爲要效顰外人的一舉一動起見</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>，於是由滿地吐痰而改爲手帕吐痰了！誠然，滿地吐痰是有傳播病菌的危險但是地上的痰，經過日光的曝晒多少要殺死一些病菌，其未被殺死的，經灰塵之播揚而分散四方，間接傳染於人，幷不見得人人皆被傳染。至於手帕吐痰呢？害處就更大了！吐者將手帕於吐過後，藏入懷中，經過體溫的蒸發，立時烘乾，這時痰上的病菌顯然地附着於衣服之上，吐者第二次取出時，將已吐過的一面翻摺過來，一反一正，一摺一疊之間，手帕上的病菌，不是立卽分散於四過，空氣以內嗎？這時對面的人，一呼吸一言語之間，無形地受着直接傳染的危險。同時吐痰者的手上，手股上無一處沒有病菌，祗要他的手隨意觸到任何物件之上，那個物件就有病菌的存在，豈不是變成了一個病菌的媒介物嗎？與這種病菌媒介物的人相處在一處，是多麼的危險啊！</p>
<p>吐痰，當然是要吐在有殺菌藥水的痰盂內的。放着痰盂不吐，而以吐在手帕上爲摩登，這種害人害己的摩登不是盲從是什麼呢？須知手帕吐痰，是一種不得已的辦法，因爲遇到沒有痰盂的地方，就非吐在手帕上不可了！不過至少要多帶幾條手帕，一條手帕祗能使用一次，用過後必須用殺菌藥水煮洗。試問事實上有幾個能做到這樣的呢？嘗見手帕吐痰者，一條手帕濃痰已細膩滿了！硬得如同漿糊過的一樣，仍然照吐，回時尙自許爲衛生大家，這種衛生，祗有請他自己來解釋。</p>
<p>有入說，隨地吐痰，如同在地上架起大砲來轟人，我以爲手帕吐痰，無異于取出槍來對面打人，大砲轟人，不見得人人被轟，手槍打人則對面者萬難幸免，二者爲禍，孰爲直接，孰爲間接，孰爲必然，孰爲偶然，不待智者而後知之。</p>
<p>總之，外國的習慣，不見得皆在可學之列。盲目的跟人家跑，總是要大上其當的，手帕吐痰不過一例而已！</p>
<h3>眼耳鼻喉疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（一一一）喉頭疾病的一般症候</p>
<p>喉頭疾病的一般症候。主要的有三。就是（一）聲音的變調，（二）呼吸障礙，及（三）咳嗽。在任何一種喉頭疾病。對於這三項症侯。常爲必發。茲特分述如左。</p>
<p>（一）聲音的變調——發音的時候。發生混濁，不純，或失去本來的音調。是卽所謂嘶嗄。劇烈的時候。竟可完全失音。稱爲失聲症。我們可以發出正常的聲音。必須具備四個條伴，就是一。振動聲帶的氣流。須一定的强度與速度，二·聲門的完全閉鎖。三·聲帶的緊張。四·聲帶的自由振動。假使聲帶自己及其附近。一旦發生病變。或者聲帶的運動系統。起了障礙。那就四個條件，一定陷於不全。而患者亦卽隨起聲音的變狀。這種事實在身體高度裏弱，聲帶過勞及炎症性充血，浸潤，潰瘍，及腫瘍的形成，聲帶肌肉及其運動神經的疾病等時。常可遇見。</p>
<p>（二）呼吸障礙——呼吸障礙大都因爲喉頭的狹窄而發。牠的主要原因。概爲喉頭或其附近的浮腫，蜂窩織炎，腫瘍（譬如甲狀腺腫，大動脈瘤或癌，）實扶的里，異物，聲門痙攀，及聲門開放筋麻痺等。呼吸障礙若係輕度。則於安靜時。並不感覺何等異常。祗有在身體運動或精神感動的時候。方始發生呼吸促迫。呼吸障礙若達高度。則有陷於窒息死的危險。</p>
<p>（三）咳嗽——咳嗽亦爲喉頭疾病常發的症候。咳嗽可以隨意的或反射的發生。在喉頭後壁，披裂软骨間縐裂，及聲帶下面等處，有疾病的時候。常易引起頑固的咳嗽發作。咳嗽時，若有分泌物咯出者。稱爲濕性咳嗽。否則稱爲乾性咳嗽。咳嗽的音調。各有不同。所以特有嘶嘎性，犬吠樣，鑛性，笛聲樣，及無響性等等的區別。</p>
<p>（一一二）喉頭炎</p>
<p>喉頭炎本有急性與慢性的兩種。不過由病例上的證明。則概以急性者爲多。允以初冬氣侯乾燥的時季。較易發生。所以現在特就急性者。略爲一說。</p>
<p>急性喉頭炎的原因。一般概由化學的，器械的，及濕熱的刺戟而起。例如感冒，聲帶的過勞，含有塵埃或有毒氣體的空氣，及烟酒的濫用等等。均足引起本症。靑年男子最易發生。發作多爲急速。常常併發咽頭炎。分泌增加。聲音嘶嘎。喉頭瘙癢。重症的時候。且訴灼熱感覺，或喉痛。有時咯出血痰。因此患者往往誤爲咯血而致驚慌。我們若用喉頭鏡試檢喉頭。則見喉頭粘膜一般潮紅浮腫。尤以會厭軟骨，會厭披裂縐襞，聲帶，假聲帶，及聲門下粘膜等處。較爲顯着。此外往往併發聲帶的運動障礙。</p>
<p>急性喉頭炎的治療。就是嚴禁烟酒的刺戟。避免談話，寒冷，及塵埃。整理便通。亦屬緊要。一切飲料食物當以溫熱爲宜。至於內服藥及局部的處置。則須由醫師處方施行。方爲妥當。</p>
<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>（成分）根中含有Acetylahikonin　Cr8Hr8O6之結晶性紫色素。</p>
<p>Acetylshikonin，結晶不易，每由植物抽出以之鹼化而成爲Shikonin　Cr6Hr6O5者也。對於原料之收得量爲0.015％。</p>
<p>Shikonin之構造式如次。</p>
<p>（藥用）紫根之浸膏，作治皮膚病之軟膏用。治火傷，凍傷，濕疹，水泡等極奏效。其最簡單之用法，係以紫根細末和於橄欖油或胡麻油中而使用。</p>
<p>舊說：紫根爲切傷，火傷之妙藥。煎汁或於油中加熱，而將溶出者作塗布用。</p>
<p>（其他用途）往昔作紫色染料用。允以澳洲南部所產者爲最有名。但因日光照射，易於褪色，是其缺點。現今殆不供染料用。</p>
<h3>介紹一種新型醫刊（上）</h3>
<p>— 守淵</p>
<p>—現代醫療譯叢—</p>
<p>說起來，已經是三四年以前的事了。那還是本人在從晨報編輯醫藥附刊的時候。我當時與醫刊寫作稿件的同人，對於國內醫藥學的出版刋物，就有一干共同的感想：以爲國內大多數醫學刊物的內容，都有一些不上不下的現象：給醫生看，實在覺得太膚淺了，少有參閱的價値；給一般非醫界的民衆讀呢，老實說，又過於高深了點，看牠不懂。我們如其要切切實實給中國的醫學文化做點工作，實有擴大組織（我們當時主持醫刋，有個小小的組織，呌做民衆醫藥社），集合對於醫學文化工作富有與趣的醫界同志，來大體地把醫藥刊物劃分的兩級，共同的來做一番「兩級制」的文字工作的必要。</p>
<p>怎樣把醫學刋物劃分爲兩級？什麼做呌醫學文字的「兩級制」呢？</p>
<p>我們把從一般民衆讀的醫識刋物，做得還要淺近些，通俗些，極力設法文字文義的大衆化，務使一般的民衆讀了，能够瞭解，容易消化。因爲這是對於民衆說話的灌輸工作。反過來，我們要寫作供給醫界同道參閱的醫學文字，便需要更專門化一些；但不要未抄舊書本的專門化，却要材料新鮮一點，而各人有點心得的專門化的文字。</p>
<p>對於這兩項的文字工作，我們當時還曾經有過一個具體的計劃：對於前者的一般性的灌輸工作，除了當時現有的醫學附刋，重加整飭之外，並擬出版若干種的通俗叢書，作爲一般民衆的醫識讀物；種於後者的工作方針呢，因專供醫界同道參閱的專門化的關係，似乎覺得比較難些，因此就把這項文字工作的念頭轉到移譯的一方面上了。因爲我們自己人辦個醫學雜誌之類的刊物，要按期寫作出新鮮而具有心得的東西，說老實話，我們是沒有這多量的新鮮題材，更沒有這許多的心得文字，可以寫作。侈譯，這當然是一種介紹的工作，我們如果能够集令起理解各國語文的若干同志，共同定購若干份精彩的各先進國的醫學刊物，來分別想做做這項介紹多譯的媒婆工作，或許還比較就想，如能徵求得同志，健全起組織之後，甚想把這專門化的一項文字工作，合力辦個刊物，專門着眼於移譯的介紹工作。這倒確是一般的臨證醫生的很好的一種精神糧食，這不是一項別開生面的有意義的工作嗎？</p>
<p>可是後來的結果，爲了各人的生活環境，經濟實况，同志趣的人才，諸如此類的現實條件所限，終於未曾實現了這一個計劃，空空的轉了一番念頭完事。及到晨報因故停了刋，連我們固有在該報上的醫藥週列，也只得宣吿「壽終正寢」了。此後，我們就對於寫作醫學文字這件工作的興趣和熱沉，也無形中淡漠下去，而我們開初所擬的種種計劃，更無心思想到，無勇氣去實現了。</p>
<p>最近，我們得到了一個很美滿的意外喜訊。在不久之前幾時，我接到了一份楊元吉醫師主編的新型醫刋，呌做「現代診療譯叢」。我趕忙的讀完了牠，接着就連想起我三四年的這一段情節來。同時，在我讀了之後，就發生出這麼一個戚想：楊醫師這個工作，卻正合乎我幾年前的一項理想工作。這工作，在目前的醫學中正是十分急近的需要着</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>醫生也拉起客來了</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>上海醫生之多，是從各馬路掛著的招牌看得出來的，因為業醫者眾，所以在營業方面，就不免要發生競爭的現象。廣告上的宣傳，自然說得天花亂墜。一針你收一塊，我便打個對折，只取五角。接生費這家要六塊洋，那家就大放盤減價四元，這種情形，看起來對於病人，象是很有利的了。其實卻不然，正是病家的不幸呵。</p>
<p>然而醫院的營業競爭，雖然劇烈，用拉客的手段來搶生意，卻還是最近才發現的新事實。某醫生專門傭人在各大醫院門前等待，遇有病人赴院求治，就設法將他拉去。這不能不說一種別開生面的營業術，影響所及，醫生的信譽受損失不必講，病家便要大上其當呢？</p>
<p>防止的方法，自然應從嚴取締野雞醫院。因為這種拉客的行為，正當的醫生，大概是不會有的，只有一些蹩腳的醫生，才做得出來。當然便是正當的院，也難保沒有惟利是圖的，但這又是另外一個問題了。</p>
<p>不過醫生專門僱人拉客這一個新事實，也可以看得出醫院營業的冷落情形來。因為近今市面受不景氣的影響，人民生活，日趨困苦。多數人家，衣食還不能維持，生病更沒有餘力吃藥。這就要使一般業醫者大受打擊，而至於有人出來搶生意。</p>
<p>妓女拉客，原是常見，不足為奇。現在醫生也拉起客來了，真是怪事。經營醫院，不從正當的方面發展，竟用拉客的手段來搶生意，說不定將來由馬路一拉，會拉至家里去，專門僱人逐戶尋求病人。</p>

<h3>凍瘡靈藥</h3>
<p>未破的當天消腫　已爛的指日收功</p>
<p>凍瘡一症，係瘀血凝結，初見紅腫，痛癢難熬，已潰之後，則膿水淋灕，疼痛尤甚，每逢冬令，此症特多，而世乏良方，患者苦之，今幸正威藥房（二馬路英華街口）發明靈藥兩種，（一）凍瘡如意水，專治未破凍瘡，一經試用，痛癢立止，紅腫頓消，（二）珍珠白玉膏，專治已爛凍瘡，一經試用，去腐生新，指日痊癒，定價如意水每瓶兩角，白玉膏每盒四角云，</p>
<h3>生計</h3>
<p>— 鄭明了</p>
<p>天很快的黑下來，已經夜了。還是不停地下著密雨，滴瀝滴瀝的，打在屋頂的破鉛皮上，又從破鉛皮的腐孔中流下來，沿著墻壁，一滴一滴地淌到地板上，地板上便像街上一個樣子了，亮光光的，反照著從外面射進來的街燈的幽綠的光，那景狀非常四人害怕，彷彿是在陰世裏的那個樣子—要是真的在陰世裏，那到也好了。林生就尋死覓活的攪了一天，可是年輕的妻子拉住他，還有那剛會走路的二歲多一點的他自己的男孩子也哭著拖住他，結果林生衹是流下一臉的眼淚，用著一種說不出的酷慘與憤恨的聲音對著他們說：「唉！我少欠了你們什麼？你們說！要我那麼活受罪！」他恨不能一頭撞死在牆上。可是說來說去，那年輕的妻子在號淘大哭中也依舊說著這麼一句不變的話：「你…你不能走這條路…看看我…看看孩子的份上…你不能走這條路…窮窮苦苦不要緊…餓死也不怨你…你不能走這條路的啊…」</p>
<p>於是，林生底心頭像澆進了一勺溶熱了的鉛一樣的，崩裂而楚痛得耐不住了，二個人拉拉扯扯的，依舊在那隻唯一的破椅子上倒下，氣喘得急急的，像鬥困了猛虎，而今是，精疲力盡，一切已走到了絕路，再也沒有一點繼續生存下去的力量與勇氣了。</p>
<p>「餓死也不怨你！」這聲音刺在林生的心裏，楚痛得格外受不住。是的，家裏老小已經有二天沒吃到什麼東西，「餓死」，也是不遠的事了，溫熱的眼淚在林生底面頰上緩緩而流，他不知道這時候所有的是一種什麼心情。</p>
<p>「可是，難道真的年紀青青的就餓死嗎？」看見女人與孩子都在飢餓中有氣無力地呻吟著，而自己，自己有著一付無病無痛的糟不死的身體，什麼事不能幹呢？就去偷，去搶，也……</p>
<p>想著想著，林生卻在極度刺激的衰落中入睡了。夜已沈得很深，外面風呼呼的吹著，把枯葉捲起在烏沈沈的半空中，又任牠們跌落在地面上的汪汪的雨水中，飄浮著像大海中給巨浪所擊破的無王的獨木舟……</p>
<p>第二天依舊下雨，黎明林生從沈睡中醒來的時候，心頭已完全平靜了。像一個已決的死犯，一切要來的終得來，苦惱也是徒然的了。望著妻與孩子，在菜色的臉上都帶有酣睡的恬容。宿夜的一切簡直像一個過去的惡夢，除了肚子</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>子餓得發酸痛，頭有點眩暈以外，甚麽也找不出悲慘的痕跡來了。</p>
<p>林生已經决定：他們一家的命運就决定在這一天。這一天，他無論如何要找到一點生計，卽使拼命，冒險也好，無論如何……</p>
<p>悄悄地爬起來開了門，街上是冷淸淸的，時間還早，路上的行人很少。大餅舖子裏在烤着麵餅，那種香味，衝着人幾乎要暈到了。對門一家兌換舖裏，伙計們正在數着銅子，包成一包包地堆在櫃台上。</p>
<p>林生狠狠地盯着看，猛地，心臟跳得很急，連手也抖起來了！那些銅子！烤餅！生計！妻與孩子！死亡……！一切像大羣的蒼蠅在腦子裏飛舞。他底手也更加抖起來了，可是最後，終於像瘋狂了一樣，奔過去把那個數銅子的伙計照臉狠狠的一拳，隨手就搶了十來包銅子，向街的遠方奔跑。</p>
<p>立刻街上擾亂起來了，店裏的伙計呌喊着追趕，人轟了一大堆，緊緊的趕在後面。最後警察也來了。三四個人在路心把林生截住，跟着警察上來狠命的打，拿銬來銬住了他底手。</p>
<p>「你說，這勾當你幹了幾次了？你老實說！」</p>
<p>「先生！老爺！我沒有幹過，這是第一次！生計！這是最後的一决生計啊……！」</p>
<p>「第一次？你當我們小孩子了。哈哈，你倒狡賴得乾凈！不給點苦頭你吃，你是不肯好好說的，走！」</p>
<p>「拍」的打了一個耳刮子，四個警察把林生像活猪一樣的拖着走了，街上依舊下着雨，泥濘得很，雜亂的脚印留在石子路上，而不遠，林生知道，就安排了各式各樣的酷刑在等着他……</p>
<h3>騾車</h3>
<p>— 路直</p>
<p>每天早晨總被那架發着鈍重的聲音的騾車擾醒。鄉村中靜得有些可怕了。因爲靜，一架木輪的車子，都會擾醒了我。而更討厭的是趕車的老頭兒，半沙啞的聲音：</p>
<p>「他媽的，你這鬼崽子，看吃鞭。……」</p>
<p>鞭子却沒有聽見打在騾身上，反換了一陣沉重的嘆息。</p>
<p>那老頭兒年紀近六十歲了。瞇縫的眼，亂草似的鬍子，臉紫紅，被灰白的鬍子蓋着，怪像聖誕老人，可是他却永遠似乎愁着臉，沒曾笑過的。</p>
<p>那頭騾子也一樣，瘦得後踝骨像兩隻角豎在後腿上，頭老沒精神的低着，它却有忍耐的勁，在老頭子喝駡以後，還是有一步沒一步的拖着蓬車兒走着。</p>
<p>鄉下的路眞有些難走，尤其是下雨天，你一隻脚踩下去，泥土立刻圍住你的脚，等你用力拔起左脚來，右脚就陷得更沉了。所以當晚上下過了雨，或是正在下雨的時候，車輪的述迍聲音沒有了，老頭子的駡聲却更密更響。也在這種時候，騾子的背上才有皮鞭鞭着的聲音。</p>
<p>我恨着，有時候氣得披起衣服到窗口去，想咒罵他兩聲，我試過幾决，可是，常我看到披了一件破碎的衣服，頭上戴着開了口的草帽，一隻手拉住韁，一隻手和半個身子在空中愰的老頭兒的樣子，咒罵的話老滾進肚子裏去了。這樣早，東方才顯一些白，星高高地亮着，就不能不趕車出去，這情景使我駡不出口。呆呆的立在窗前，看他努力的趕騾兒走過不平的路，而去找他和騾子兩口兒的食糧。雖然我知道這一會起身，今天準要頭痛一天。我有太不興的習慣，早晨一起身就不能再睡的。一天的功課又沒有空檔的時候，和那條騾兒相彷從早晨上到夜晚。</p>
<p>有時候，晚飯吃過一二點鐘的時候，這老頭兒又趕着車子回來了。趕回車子的時候，常只聽到車輪在不平路上滾過的聲音，他很少開口駡騾子了的。不過有時候，也許買賣不好，皮鞭的聲音很饗亮的在夜空中傳過。</p>
<p>老頭兒眞只剩了和騾兒兩口兒了。沒有孩子。有一决回來得很早，而且吃了酒，大槪買賣順手。我和兩個同事找他談話。他停了車兒，在駕御臺上愰着頭。也是這時候我看他那雙籠滿了憂愁的眼睛，他在這得意的時侯，都趕不去憂愁。</p>
<p>「我有好幾個孩子呢，大的現在在的話……有（他數着）近四十了呢，最小的也要二十歲了。……我現在想想有些恨了，不生個把女的，全是男孩子，四個，你先生們想，多有福氣，……幾個都吃糧去，去了不回來了，留我這個乾老頭子和這匹騾子。就是這匹騾子好容易才留得住，吃糧的要拉他去，我將它藏在山洞要，眞的，我現在想想，我的孩子不該讓他們吃糧去的，什麼孫大帥，盧大帥，有金有銀，我老頭兒現在只有光身了。還靠這匹騾子，他正抵過我的兒子呢！……先生不早了，我要去放放這畜生呢！」這樣說時他又趕着車子走了。</p>
<p>有時候想起這條灰毛的小騾子來，替它慶幸，它有老頭子的愛惜，而我們白天到黑夜，騾子一般做着只有空洞和寂寞。</p>
<p>我忍受了半年騾車的聲音，而現在很久沒聽到木輪的聲音和那老頭子的帶着愛憐的咒罵聲，覺得寂寞了。現在他還健着吧。</p>
<h3>農場小景</h3>
<p>— 羅</p>
<p>冬天，有一個可愛底太陽。</p>
<p>打麥塲上已經堆起了高高的柴堆。又是豐收，暫時打開了農夫們緊鎖了一年的眉心。但是每天得到市鎮上去探詢「行情」，豐收在他們心底深處遺留着一個可怕的印象！「穀價不値錢呵！」或許他們懷念着一頭賣去的牛而傷心起來。</p>
<p>麻雀像小孩子一樣在塲地上跳來蹦去，它們在不知什麼地方已經守候了一年，現在抖着斑色的麻衣，尖黃的小嘴在喙着每一顆潔白的稻粒，一頓豐富的盛餐呵！</p>
<p>田地裏遺留着稻的根，一叢叢的，那樣齊整，讓太陽遍地曬着。站在田塲上向前面望去，田隴彷彿腰帶似的，束着方方的田畝，一直接到天的邊緣；那邊浮着淺灰的白雲。</p>
<p>遠遠的河邊，有一架牛車棚，剛修紮的新的茅柴頂，在太陽底下閃着光。車棚裏靜悄悄地，祗有風穿過軸轤時發出吱吱前聲一音。那頭終年辛勞的老牛，栓在樹底下—現在是它休息的時候了。它剛吃過了一餐飽飽的茅柴，掄起一對修長的眼睛對車棚望着，它或許在奇怪，它打了幾個年頭的水，不知挨過了牧童多少鞭子，怎會逃不出這個狹小的車棚呢？</p>
<p>太陽底下，農婦們坐在背風的地方。有的在補衲一襲孩子們的衣服，有的把新的稻草替丈夫打一雙上鎮去的新鞋。自己的心裏也藏着一個希望，希望米價往上漲，糶得好價錢的時候，買一件時式的衣服過新年。這希望已經不是一年二年的事了，她們身上還穿着嫁時的衣服呢！</p>
<p>最高興的自然是孩子。他們纏着母親要炒蠶荳，大家掏了一把藏在衣袋裏，圍在塲地的角落裏劃烏龜卦，把蠶荳做輸贏。</p>
<p>在這般可愛的太陽底下，我們就沒有見過一個莊稼人在那裏度過一個安閑的下午，祗有白了頭髮的老爹抽着廉價的旱烟袋，回憶着他們的黃金時代呢！</p>
<p>那些被夏天惡毒的太陽曬紫了皮膚的莊稼漢子，現在都聚集在市鎭上的小茶館裏，他們要在一個滿意的「行情」下把自己種下的一顆顆穀變了錢來還債，過年，替妻子添一件新的衣服。他們的心彷彿車棚裏的軸轤一樣，沒有休止地打着轉呢。</p>
<p>太陽經過一天的行程，被烏鴉的噪聲送回去了，每家茅屋頂上吹起了嬝嬝的黑烟。又是一天，過年更近了。</p>
<h3>妻子當奶媽去了</h3>
<p>— 張靜霞作</p>
<h3>車箱裏</h3>
<p>— 羅鬱</p>
<p>被兜在車箱裏的早春天氣融合着紙烟底濃味，變成悶人的。</p>
<p>她們給高速度蹂蹉了的軀體擁在兩隻靠椅間。下午的陽光窺進窗子，搖顫不寗地逗在她們底手上膝上又從這個面孔移到另一面孔上。</p>
<p>在門口處，一個着了鐵路制服的年靑人用唐山的娓婉音調和他底同事打了招呼，於是用平穩的步子走回車箱裏來。走到三個婦人的身邊。</p>
<p>「剛才和你說話的是誰」？</p>
<p>「臨近的同事，又是同鄉」。</p>
<p>那個四十歲模樣的婦人和那穿制服的問答着，她有一幅傳道士的悲憫的顏面，和一對常是悲憫着的眼睛。那對眼睛一逕不倦地向山嶺樹木間追尋着，像在那裏看到什麽埋藏着的幸福。</p>
<p>「姑母？您看看那邊。我爸就在那個鎮上作事的」。那個靑年已坐到她的右手邊；在窗口處，指着遠遠的山脚。這樣述說着。那邊是糢糊的杉林，有一層瘴氣停留着，底下是烏黑的界綫，一端隱隱的有松屋的頂。</p>
<p>三對眼睛神往地望過去。</p>
<p>那靑年男子底面，是不久才修過的，當着窗口，顯得很明朗。他有着一對顯露的大眼珠，微微向前突出的口，是一個機警小心的年靑人。他不斷軋出幾個微笑來，看相着對面那個新婦底白嫩的面孔。</p>
<p>她是他底剛結了婚的妻，他們就要在前邊的鐵路終點的新鎭上安家的。</p>
<p>那個著着鮮明衣裳的女子，看來常常是憂悒着的，不大說話，坐在那兒想着事。車頂的反光映在那有着粉跡的面孔上，作出了顫抖着的紫色。她底腿上睡着小兄弟。她底媽媽，一個肥胖的婦人，埋着臉在她左肩膀上沉沉地發出鼾聲。</p>
<p>「天不黑我們就得到家啦」。那個穿制服的靑年像安慰似的自語着，伸一伸腰板。</p>
<p>「到家給朋哥搭電話，讓他今晚看咱們來」。姑母向那靑年說着，眼光在那一片赭紅色的石坡上磨擦過去。</p>
<p>「他不能來的，您盼他今晚跟車來」？那個男子停了一下又說：「剛才那位同事告訴，朋哥進醫院裡去了」。</p>
<p>「怎麼，是說他底病變重了嗎」！站母焦慮地問着。那個男子沉默了一下說：</p>
<p>「他底麻木病是不變的，（不過右手在生過氣後全不能動）。那個同事說到他底眼暗，有一决表嫂把他底頭撞在壁上，使他無力舉手，於是眼睛出了毛病。他有一天黃昏在車站見到他，「爲什麼老不回去呢」？他問那個呆立在站臺上的朋哥，可是第一句沒有回答，再看時才知道他是在那兒掙扎着，痛苦的等候着呢；他只說：「我看不淸東西了。老哥」。那位同事領他回去了，像領一個瞎子似的」。說到這里，他停件了，他看到那姑母底臉上的變動，那是久於啜泣的忍歛的表情。</p>
<p>「不過，崗田站長還好，要他少作事，又帮他醫治眼睛，還有同鄉們」。</p>
<p>姑母像陷入一種夢的絕境，嘴層顫動着，想說些話，可是很困難的。</p>
<p>這時，對面的那個女子忽然發言了。</p>
<p>「聽說表嫂讀過書呢」。</p>
<p>這句話使姑母大爲不安起來。可是那個丈夫却以他底年靑的爽直回答着：</p>
<p>「讀書？就算有那麽回事，也改不了性質的。她祗是無故和表兄賭氣。媽媽常說表兄底脾氣眞好：他說鐵路四周的女兒那麽多，却偏遇到這位女寨主，她給過表兄好幾封信呢」。</p>
<p>新婦聽了作着微笑；接着又是陰淡淡的垂下眼簾。那樣子比前更是憂悒的。</p>
<p>那個姑母一逕耽心地聽了兩小底對答，他却把眼光注在那女子底白嫩的面孔上，這樣就使牠旣埋垂了又暈紅着了</p>
<p>一種深刻的悲哀閃過這位姑母底眼睛。她一時心裏很慌亂，看來那白嫩的但不甚美好的女臉上，有着使她眩惑的東西流動着。</p>

<p>風雲起伏論短畏。民氣消沉外族强。我華本自崑崙起。東遷還從夏禹商。周朝八百延社稷。蔭封王族達四疆。中原華夏漸决拓。夷蠻戎狄淪爲荒。春秋戰國多奇蹟。併呑一統秦始皇。橫暴無道眞專制。斬蛇起義出劉邦。爲民請命把秦楚滅。只靠那，韓信蕭何與張良。五世傳位唔帝立。當時節，東方寇惠好强梁。奸淫擄掠無不作。沿海居民欠安康。膏腴美土成白地。千里平原一片荒。民族英雄及時起。出將入相有霍光。殺得那，船折桅摧人頭落。魄散魂消避在洋。從此邊民樂康莊。至今沿海有廟堂。大將軍三字傳遠近。萬世流名千古芳。</p>

<p>開篇「富貴貧窮新開篇」</p>
<p>同是懷胎十月生。老天本是極公平。那知社會情形變。分出富貴貧窮重與輕。富的是有無限家財難計算。金銀珠寳滿箱盛。高廳大屋無其數。喚婢呼妓把飲食烹。買得良田將租米取。不顧那農村破產要化刀兵。貴的是有權有勢欺人極。公理全無不顧名。全不想雪柱冰山難以久。將來家產要犧牲。最苦的平民境遇正窮苦。呼籲無門不作聲。竭力維持心力竭。可憐有地不能耕。有的是失敗頓然萌短見。懸樑投水把心橫。我想那尼山夫子人難及。他說均則無貧意甚明。可惜無人依此辦。弄得變成階級分辱和榮。將來平等自由後。一視同仁如弟兄。方能得見海宇淸。</p>

<h3>Military Operations to Suppress Bandits: Focus Shifts to Eastern Suiyuan; National Army Reaches Vicinity of Damaozi; Bandits Plan Offensive Against Eastern Suiyuan; A Wang Visits Fu Zuoyi for Instructions; Bailingmiao Renamed Bailinmiao</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Datong dispatch: The focus of military operations to suppress bandits in Suiyuan has now shifted from northern Suiyuan to eastern Suiyuan. The National Army is preparing to clear the northern Suiyuan battlefield and then besiege Shangdu, hoping to wipe out the bandit nest in one fell swoop. Li Fuying, recognizing the gravity of his responsibility, has issued a letter to all officers and soldiers nationwide, urging them to work hard to suppress bandits and safeguard the nation. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) News received here today from Guihua states that the National Army has advanced from Bailingmiao and occupied Wufulang (transliteration) near Damaozi. Damaozi is 60 miles east of Bailingmiao and is currently the base for the Mongol-Manchu mixed army's offensive against northern Suiyuan. It is believed that the Mongol-Manchu mixed army, mindful of its defeat in northern Suiyuan, may launch an offensive against Xinghe and Taolin in eastern Suiyuan. The defending forces in that area are preparing to fiercely counterattack. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) On the 3rd and 4th, the bandit-puppet forces launched an all-out counterattack on Bailingmiao. Our army fought bravely and routed the bandits, capturing many. Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan sent a telegram on the 6th, issuing commendations and awarding the soldiers 10,000 yuan to encourage them. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Regarding the report from the 5th that 400 to 500 bandits in the Sanyan Hulun area north of Wuchuan County had contacted the National Army to discuss surrender, it is learned that the National Army has formally accepted their surrender and appointed the bandit leader Jin Yinzhang as the commander of the Provisional 4th Brigade. The unit consists of two regiments. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) To commemorate the National Army's recapture of Bailingmiao, the Suiyuan Provincial Government plans to rename the area "Bailinmiao" (Hundred Forest Temple). Given the fertile soil, suitable for planting trees, a hundred-forest zone will be designated, and a large-scale afforestation project will be implemented next spring. Local residents in the vicinity have been ordered to prepare seedlings early in anticipation of planting. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Altan Wang of the Ih Meng League arrived in Suiyuan from Baotou on the 7th to visit Fu Zuoyi and seek instructions. According to reports, the Ih Meng League is currently very peaceful. It is reported that he has met with Fu and will soon return to the League. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining dispatch: The weather here has been extremely cold in recent days, with temperatures between 35 and 36 degrees below zero. Sand and snow are whipped up by the wind, and exhaled breath turns into frozen clouds. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Since the National Army's recapture of Bailingmiao, Fu Zuoyi has been deeply concerned about the resettlement of Mongol areas. In addition to strictly ordering the local garrison to provide care and comfort to the affected people, he has allocated 1,000 yuan to be distributed by Yun Wang to the affected people and lamas for relief. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ba Wenjun received a report from the Suiyuan front stating that the fighting on the front lines has been relatively quiet recently, with only occasional minor skirmishes, not major battles. Currently, the bandit-puppet forces are actively transporting troops and building fortifications, suggesting that intense fighting will occur in the near future. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bandit-Puppet Forces Conspire in Shangdu to Disturb Eastern Suiyuan</p>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor from Zhangjiakou reported that, in view of the repeated failures of the puppet Mongol bandits to attack Bailingmiao, and because of the solid defenses of our army, a certain party has decided to postpone the attack on Bailingmiao and concentrate all efforts on eastern Suiyuan. Therefore, for days, this party has presided over meetings of various bandit leaders in Shangdu to plan attacks on eastern Suiyuan. Recently, they have purchased a large quantity of gasoline from the Asiatic Petroleum Company, Texaco, and Mobil in Zhangjiakou and transported it to Shangdu. The puppet side has sent personnel to Zhangjiakou to purchase hides. Large trucks travel daily between Shangdu and Zhangjiakou, transporting military supplies. The bandit troops of Gan Ying have suffered repeated defeats and are nearly wiped out. Wang Ying himself has been ostracized by the puppet bandit leaders and is in a very difficult situation. This party is monitoring him very closely. The puppet troops, nearly 30,000 strong, transferred from Rehe Province by this party have all arrived in the Shangdu, Kangbao, and Zhangbei areas. The puppet troops are actively building defensive fortifications, indicating a large-scale invasion. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Certain Party Realizes Bandit-Puppets Are Ineffective</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A chief of a certain special affairs agency in Shangdu flew to Tianjin on the morning of the 7th to visit Commander 〇〇 and discuss matters. According to lateral sources, the chief indicated that, after the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, the bandit-puppet forces suffered repeated defeats. The weather has been severely cold recently, making combat difficult. Most of the Mongol puppet troops have concentrated in the Damaozi, Shangdu, and Jiabusitai areas, building solid fortifications to defend themselves and await a formal decision from the 〇〇 military headquarters. One brigade of the Rehe 〇 division is monitoring activities in the above areas. If the three areas are lost and the Mongol puppet troops retreat, they will be eliminated to prevent them from fleeing into puppet Manchukuo territory. Currently, only several thousand special operations troops are active in various parts of northeastern Suiyuan, mainly to disrupt the enemy's line of sight and exhaust their forces. The staff officer of the 〇〇 army who is in charge of this matter has now realized that the forces of Li Shouxin and Wang Ying will not succeed and that regular troops must be mobilized. However, mobilization and preparation will take time, at least two weeks, so a major battle will occur in the near future. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>De Wang Coerced to Go to Lamuleng Temple</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining dispatch: De Wang was coerced to go to Lamuleng Temple on the 5th by a certain special affairs agency chief, Kuwahara. He was accompanied by over 500 Mongol guards. Zhang Junzhe's and Peng Jinsheng's units of the puppet Rehe cavalry brigade are transporting supplies from Kangbao to that area, intending to defend it to shield Jiabusitai. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Certain Army Reorganizes Into Twelve Detachments</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining dispatch: Starting from the 5th, a certain army outside the Pass began a major reshuffle, drawing units from various forces and planning to organize them into twelve detachments, commanded by a certain lieutenant general division commander. These will be divided into two groups to invade eastern and western Suiyuan. In addition, over 10,000 puppet troops, under the command of De Wang and a certain special affairs agency chief, will contain our front in Wuchuan. Each detachment will adopt a mixed編制, with cavalry, infantry, and mechanized battle teams as the main force, totaling over 30,000 personnel. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Spokesman of Japanese Foreign Ministry Talks: Kawagoe May Return Home; Qingdao Incident Falsely Accuses Us of Anti-Japanese Sentiment; Denies Report of Demands</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Great importance is attached here to the declaration issued by our Foreign Ministry on the 6th. Although the spokesman of the Japanese Foreign Ministry was questioned by various foreign reporters today, he was unwilling to explain the exact situation of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, only stating that Ambassador Kawagoe may return home to report on the Nanjing negotiations. At the same time, he dismissed rumors that Ambassador Kawagoe was tired of his post, saying that there was no basis for this claim. Regarding the Qingdao incident, the spokesman said that the nature of this matter was not a purely industrial dispute and was mixed with anti-Japanese terrorist activities, so it was necessary for the marines to land. The spokesman further denied that Japan had made demands to the Qingdao Municipal Government, such as closing down party headquarters. He said that Consul-General Nishiharu Hiko was the direct responsible official stationed in Qingdao and should consult with Mayor Shen Honglie regarding stabilizing the local situation. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Suma and Gao Zongwu's meeting regarding Sino-Japanese negotiations on the 5th, the situation remained quiet on the 7th. No meeting was held today. It is reported that the Japanese side has tried its best to narrow the scope of continued exchanges of views. It is also learned that the Japanese side is currently working actively to break the stalemate regarding the issue of economic cooperation in North China. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Jicheng Travels North to See Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The newly appointed Director of the Border Region of Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi Provinces, Chen Jicheng, attended a farewell banquet hosted by the Commercial Bank and the Hankou Chamber of Commerce at noon on the 7th. At 11:50 p.m. that night, he boarded a train north to Luoyang to await an audience with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and seek instructions on important matters.

<h3>Li Sihao in Tianjin Visits Horiuchi Before Returning to Beiping; No Concrete Results on Economic Development</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Sihao visited Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi at 11:00 a.m. on the 7th to discuss economic cooperation, returning to Beiping in the evening.

He originally planned to meet Ikeda again on the morning of the 7th, but the meeting did not take place because he had other business. Regarding economic cooperation in North China, the Japanese side is currently focusing on: 1. Salt exports and improvement; 2. Cotton and grass improvement and technical cooperation. Our side accepts these principles in principle, but there is a limit to their implementation. For example, salt exports must at least guarantee that they are not privately sold in coastal areas, disrupting our salt administration. This contact was related to these two matters, but no concrete conclusions were reached. The Japanese side considers the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway construction to be a fait accompli and no longer discusses it. The Suiyuan incident is considered by the Japanese side to be another issue, so it has not been affected. If the war expands and the fluctuations are wide, everything will naturally be difficult to carry out. The issue of funding for economic development has not been resolved, as the amount needed is too large and it is difficult to raise it all at once. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Province: Deadline for Completion of Local Granaries; Grain Storage at All Levels from Province and County Down to Baojia; Pledge Value of Grain Set at 80%</h3>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: This year's harvest in various parts of Jiangxi Province has been bountiful. In addition to storing grain at all levels from the province and county down to the district and baojia in preparation for famine and emergencies, the Rural Cooperative Committee has also consulted with various banks to provide loans to rural cooperative committees and rural joint associations in districts and counties in the central rice-producing areas to establish granaries and engage in storage and pledges to prevent wealthy gentry and merchants from manipulating grain prices. The granaries established by the Rural Cooperative Committee in Linchuan, Zhangshu, Fengcheng, and other places have already stored a large amount of rice. The pledge price standard is approximately 80% of the market price. With the current grain price at around 3 yuan, each dan (unit of weight) of grain can be pledged for 2.4 yuan. When the price rises again in the future, it can still be redeemed and sold for a higher price. However, as winter is approaching and the time of low grain prices is about to pass, the Rural Cooperative Committee specifically issued a notice yesterday to rural cooperative committees in various places, setting a deadline for all granary loans to be completed by the end of the year (December) without delay. Investigations show that the grain price in this province, except for Shicheng, Zixi, and Suichuan, where the grain cannot be sold and still sells for 1 yuan per unit, the grain prices in other places are still rising continuously. The reasons are: first, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces and military rice are purchasing in this province; second, the current situation is affecting prices; third, banks and rural cooperative committees are organizing storage and pledges; fourth, counties, districts, bao, and jia are organizing grain storage, so grain prices are consistently above 3 yuan. Therefore, the rural economy is slightly better than last year. (December 2nd)</p>
<h3>Absolutely No Interference in Our Internal Affairs is Allowed: Ju Zheng's Report at the National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Ju reported at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 7th, first explaining from the perspective of international law that our country's handling of communists and bandits is our internal affair and that absolutely no unreasonable interference from foreign countries is allowed. He stated that the communist party has been causing disturbances in our country for several years. After vigorous suppression, they are already at the end of their rope. The remaining remnants in the Northwest can be completely eliminated imminently. This kind of turmoil does not pose the slightest danger to our country. Furthermore, as for countries far across the ocean or neighboring countries, if they speak of danger, this is merely "borrowing trouble" and "unnecessary worry." As for the bandit-puppet regime in Suiyuan, after being severely suppressed by the national army, those who retreated retreated, and those who repented repented. It can also be pacified in a short time. If they want to use the excuse that there is a danger of spreading to other countries, this is even more irrelevant. He concluded by saying that on the day when the National Government is making efforts to eliminate internal strife and achieving successive victories, and when the National Government has fulfilled its 100% obligation to create peace and order to protect the safety of life and freedom and economic development of its own people and friendly foreign residents, there is absolutely no legal basis to allow others to interfere in internal affairs. If any person or any country unreasonably interferes, we are prepared to shed the hot blood of our 400 million people to deal with them in order to fight for the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation.

<h3>The Strategy of British Diplomacy (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By British Walteros qleol, translated by Yu Erchang</p>
<p>Everything has been laid out before us: five basic principles guide our diplomats in deciding their strategy, five external influences perplex them, and five intricate international relationships almost deal them a fatal blow.</p>
<p>Given the known international situation, how will our diplomats use their principles to determine their strategy? Can the strategy they decide guarantee that they will achieve their intended goals? What relationship will the success or failure of their strategy have to world peace and war, progress and regress? How can our labor movement prevent, restrain, and control our reactionary foreign ministry?</p>
<p>Supporting the Weakest Link—The Core of British Diplomatic Strategy</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, I cannot discuss the impact of each factor listed in the previous table on British diplomatic strategy one by one. However, from what has been described in the past, readers can often imagine the difficult situation our foreign secretary and his staff are in. In addition, they are well aware that free pacifism cannot be ignored, that the middle class, having been baptized by capitalism, will always put personal gain before the interests of the nation; and they must also worry that workers with class consciousness can launch a revolutionary movement at any time. Where will they find their way out?</p>
<p>But they finally found a solution. They raised the banner of "protecting capitalism," which is very appealing in some countries. With this banner, our diplomats believe they can reconcile with the externally strong but internally weak fascist countries, gain their support to restore the international balance of power, and preserve their own position. Isolation is impossible, and it is necessary to obtain the support of some forces. However, (1) this support force should not be too strong, so as to prevent a situation where the tail wags the dog and is not under command; (2) this support force must need Britain's help urgently, and the need must be even greater than Britain's need for their help. Well, then our diplomats have found their treasure: the sick fascist countries. See, isn't this a great trick: to appease a sick fascist country; to feed it with money; to encourage its desire for occupation; to hire it as one's own guard; to buy its gratitude; and to bind it with debt. But this trick is also not easy to play. The United States made a slight contribution in the last war, and later most of the debtors slipped away from their debts. However, the road has reached the last stage, and there is no other trick to play besides this. Only by playing it with confidence can the British Empire still have some hope of resisting the Soviet Union, suppressing the United States, and continuing to maintain its leading position.</p>
<p>We can now see that the policy that seems to have been forming in the minds of our diplomats in 1936 is this: to protect capitalism, and to protect capitalism is to help the weakest link. There are many reasons for adopting the strategy of helping the weakest countries in capitalism: (1) these countries are weak, so it is easy to pull them over; (2) rescuing the weakest countries in capitalism is to help world capitalism avoid disintegration; (3) we need their support to maintain our leading position; (4) the weaker these countries are, the more powerful their military is; (5) these countries are anti-liberal, anti-socialist, anti-internationalist, and anti-democratic - and we, the British ruling class, are most afraid of liberalism, socialism, internationalism, and democracy, because these are enough to undermine our leading position. "Divide and rule." This is part of our traditional policy. Only by doing so can we hope to maintain our heavy empire. We must be chivalrous knights who "take from the haves and give to the have-nots." In this way, we can build a balance of power that is beneficial to ourselves.</p>
<p>Can Britain Achieve Its Goals?</p>
<p>The above explains how the British ruling class is internally forming its diplomatic strategy. Although this strategy has not yet fully solidified, it will generally not change much. Indeed, Hitler's recent speeches have focused more on colonial demands, which has resulted in The Times' mild satire of the Nuremberg Nazi Party speeches. "If the German leaders imagine that this country is ready to join them in cutting off the head of communism and making fascism the king of Europe, then they are very mistaken about the temperament of the British people." (September 14 editorial) But unfortunately, that is exactly the direction in which British foreign policy is pointing.</p>
<p>But who will fascism sacrifice to become the "king of Europe"? RP Dodd said in the May issue of Labor Monthly's Daily Notes:</p>
<p>"Hitler's war plan is a Nazi dagger, the tip of which is aimed at the hearts of the people east of the Rhine, so it can also be said to be aimed at the peace of all of Europe and the world. A few leading leaders of British imperialism have gradually realized that after the success of Hitler's first phase of the plan, this Nazi dagger will be turned towards the British Empire."</p>
<p>John Strachey (in the April 7 Daily Worker) said even more emphatically:</p>
<p>"I think this is not a heresy: under these circumstances, Hitler may turn his entire foreign policy around, make a compromise with the Soviet Union, and then suddenly make various demands on a prostrate Britain. At that time, if Britain does not recognize it, it will have to face a war alone."</p>
<p>Naturally, our government is not unaware of the danger, but is it completely awake and ready to abandon the dream of sacrificing the Soviet Union and other small and weak countries to satisfy the ambitions of Germany and Japan in order to maintain its own position? Has our government underestimated the internal strength of the Soviet Union too much, and overestimated the power of Hitler's dictatorship? We know that at present, Hitler is still constantly thinking of grabbing Britain's help.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>What is the conclusion we have reached from the foregoing analysis: The terror of fascism has driven the progressive forces of the world to unite. The first harvest of the French United Front excited people all over Europe. People have realized that fascism is not only an enemy of democracy, but also a destroyer of common obligations, collective security, and various international peace organizations. The dictatorships are interfering in the internal affairs of weak countries and occupying their lands, and their ultimate goal is the destruction of democracy around the world. In order to deal with this danger, collective security and mutual assistance are indispensable. The global united front to defend democracy has obviously been established. Isn't the World Peace Congress in Brussels proof of this? Which side will our government stand on? Naturally, it will not stand on the side of Sir Cecil and the International Peace Front. Dominions and colonies cannot be mixed with democracy and progress. Since this is the case, then there is only the road of dictatorship and reaction. Imperialism is always imperialism. Sir Bradford once said, "We did not conquer India for the benefit of the Indian people.... We conquered India with the sword, and we will defend India with the sword." (October 17 Daily News) Our government seems to have been trapped on the road to stubbornness, and it may be impossible to turn back even if it wants to.</p>
<p>In the Far East, Japan is constantly encroaching on our interests in China. We also want to use reconciliation and bribery to ask them to stop, but is this possible? Our government is hesitating and hesitant, but there are no resolute steps. In this regard, the threat to democracy, socialism, and world peace is always present.</p>
<p>In this country, the need for a united front is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>

<h3>Prospects for Sino-Japanese Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— All</p>
<p>Adjusting Sino-Japanese relations is the highest call of today's general society and the most ardent desire of peace-loving nations. However, since the start of negotiations, several months have passed, and not only has there been no progress in mutual understanding, but the situation has become increasingly serious. The Suiyuan Incident erupted, followed by the Qingdao dispute, almost leading to the inability to conduct diplomatic negotiations. This is a matter of great regret for those who care about the overall situation in East Asia.</p>
<p>We have also pondered anxiously and thoughtfully, wondering why the adjustment work is so difficult to complete. Where does the reason lie? Examining past facts, it is not difficult to understand the truth thoroughly. It lies in our adherence to the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty, while they regard military threats as their forte. Pursuing closeness with such goals is like going south while heading north, utterly impossible. Even a three-year-old child knows that the impasse is very difficult to break.</p>
<p>When Foreign Minister Zhang began negotiations with Ambassador Arita, he already clarified our country's position of maintaining territorial integrity. Under this principle, the first issue to be resolved was the Northeast problem. However, after Arita considered that the time was not yet ripe, Foreign Minister Zhang also knew that this move would not be easy to accomplish suddenly. In order to show the genuine sincerity of adjusting national relations, he resolutely abandoned his original position and temporarily set aside the matter, focusing only on finding ways to eliminate the state of affairs hindering the administrative integrity of Hebei, Chahar, and Inner Mongolia. However, what was the Japanese side's response to our excessive sincerity? How was their continued program of aggression reflected in reality? This is the first point that shows our side cannot be blamed for lacking sincerity. The biggest criticism the Japanese side makes against us today is the agitation of national sentiment. For a country with 400 million people, subjected to continuous damage over the years, to remain silent like cicadas in winter or tremble like horses facing a phantom enemy is not easy. In order to maintain genuine peace between the two countries, the government has repeatedly admonished and suppressed such sentiments. The people, understanding this intention, have also had to restrain their indignant emotions in order to seek improvement in the situation. Such a peace-loving nation is rare in the world. Unfortunately, they still consider it insufficient, constantly casting negative impressions and increasing the stimulation of our people, creating irreparable antipathy. When water overflows, the responsibility lies where it belongs. Even a government that strives for tolerance will lose its ability to control. This is the second point that shows our side has exhausted all means to adjust national relations.</p>
<p>In short, the situation has reached a point where one can only sigh in dismay. If the Japanese side truly has no intention of starting a war lightly, it should first selectively resolve local incidents to an appropriate extent, and then gradually seek to improve overall national relations as the world situation evolves. If they still fail to understand our country's situation and insist on going their own way, even believing that they can adopt an automatic policy toward China, as stated in the recent Three Provinces Conference, then the future will be fraught with dangerous changes, beyond imagination. It must be understood that our country's concessions have reached their final limit. The people all have a firm determination, deeply ashamed of the insults they have suffered and anxious about impending disaster. The entire country is sharpening its swords, preparing only for calm and determined struggle.</p>
<h3>Baldwin Explains to the House of Commons the Process of the King's Marriage Proposal; Everything is Still Undecided; Churchill Speaks with Embarrassment</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin made a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon regarding the constitutional dispute, stating, "The government has not offered any other advice besides presenting the King with the issue of a morganatic marriage. My personal conversations with the King were purely private and informal." Baldwin's statement, in response to the question raised by Labour Party leader Attlee last Friday, should dispel many rumors, including those mentioned in Churchill's statement yesterday. After Baldwin's statement, Churchill attempted to rise and speak, criticizing the government, but was forced to sit down in silence due to opposition from the crowd. Liberal MP Lambert then asked Baldwin whether he was aware that the House of Commons expressed deep sympathy for him. After Lambert finished speaking, the entire chamber cheered in agreement. Subsequently, Baldwin answered Churchill's question, stating that the King had not yet made a decision and said, "All these issues were not initially raised by the government. In fact, during a conversation between the King and myself, the King himself told me that he intended to marry Mrs. Simpson after she was free. This shows that the King has held this intention for some time. After the King decides on the path he wants to take, he will naturally inform the government and the various dominions. At that time, each government will try to offer appropriate advice on the King's decision, to fulfill their responsibilities. Before concluding this statement, I should first express the feeling of the entire House, which is that at present, we have deep and respectful sympathy for the King." After Baldwin finished speaking, the entire chamber cheered loudly, expressing their agreement.</p>
<p>Labour Party leader Attlee then spoke, stating that the people of the country would undoubtedly agree with Baldwin's views and requested Baldwin to disclose as much information about the matter as possible to satisfy the expectations of the country. Baldwin immediately replied that the King had not yet made a decision, so there was no information to disclose. Churchill then rose and spoke, asking Baldwin whether he could guarantee that no firm steps would be taken before the House of Commons received all the information about the matter. While Churchill was speaking, some people shouted "Shame" and "Sit down" to interrupt him. Churchill continued his speech, asking Baldwin not to forget that this incident affected the entire constitution. At this point, others in the chamber shouted again to stop Churchill from speaking. However, Churchill still spoke loudly amidst the disturbances, saying, "If the House of Commons does not allow me to ask questions, the result will make my words even more important." Then the Speaker asked Churchill to be as simple as possible when asking questions. Churchill ignored this and reiterated the above request. However, the noise in the chamber at that time made Churchill's words impossible to hear, so he had no choice but to sit down in silence. Baldwin replied to Churchill amidst cheers, saying, "I find it difficult to answer Churchill's question at present because I do not yet know what the King wants to decide."

<h3>The King's Marriage Problem is Still Under Careful Study; The Element of Abdication is Reduced</h3>
<p>(London) From morning today, the public gathered on Downing Street and other important locations despite the severe cold, watching the comings and goings of ministers and other dignitaries. The King's official car carried Mr. Monckton, legal advisor to the Duchy of Cornwall, from Fort Belvedere Palace to No. 10 Downing Street, where it remained for two and a half hours. It is reported that before Mr. Monckton arrived, Colonial Secretary MacDonald visited Prime Minister Baldwin with a stack of documents and left after ten minutes. Sir Peacock, the tax revenue manager for the Duchy of Cornwall, visited the Prime Minister after Monckton. The King is currently staying at Fort Belvedere Palace. There was no activity there last night. The lights, which usually did not go out until four or five in the morning after the crisis, were not seen after two o'clock last night. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The Attorney General of the Duchy of Cornwall, namely the King's confidant, Monckton, went to the Prime Minister's office at 10:15 AM this morning and had a conversation with the Prime Minister for two and a half hours before leaving. In addition, twenty Conservative Members of Parliament from both the House of Lords and the House of Commons held a special meeting to discuss the constitutional disputes caused by the marriage problem. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) It is now reliably learned that King Edward VIII is considering flying to Cannes, France, to meet with Mrs. Simpson to discuss the issue of abdication. It is also learned that the King is considering indefinitely postponing the marriage at the request of three or five close friends. The odds on abdication have decreased from two to one. (National News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) It is known today that Queen Mary and members of the Royal Family are all afraid that the King might suddenly take a plane to secretly meet with Mrs. Simpson in the South of France. The Queen Mother had a meeting with the King from 4:30 PM to 7:20 PM on Sunday afternoon, and it is said that there was a fierce argument. The Queen Mother strongly advised the King, for the sake of his personal conduct and the teachings of his ancestors, not to prioritize personal desires over the responsibilities of the nation. However, the King said that he had the right to choose his own way of life and therefore refused the Queen Mother's advice. At that time, the King's face was haggard and he was very angry. Members of the Royal Family all believed that the King had decided to abdicate, and the Queen Mother, considering the King's attitude, also felt that abdication was better. It is said that the Queen Mother's spirit has been overly strained and she is unable to support herself. She has looked old in recent days, but she is still able to deal with the crisis with a brave attitude. According to those close to the Royal Family, the Queen Mother weeps day and night, her mind is dazed, and she does not believe that the people's love for the Royal Family, built up by her late husband George and her own life's efforts, will be overthrown in one day, and she feels infinite pain in her heart.

<h3>Only the Duke of Cornwall's Flag Flies Over the King's Palace; Newspapers Consider it a Sign of Abdication; Airplanes and Royal Cars Come and Go</h3>
<p>(London) According to custom, the Monarch's flag (red, blue, and gold) should be flown wherever the King resides. However, Marlborough House, where Queen Mary resides, still flies this flag. As for Fort Belvedere Palace, where King Edward VIII resides, the flag waving in the wind from the tower is the Duke of Cornwall's flag (the flag is black with fifteen gold ancient coins), not the Monarch's flag. The newspapers have commented on this one after another, believing that the King's willingness to fly the Duke's flag is not a good sign. There were few people going to Fort Belvedere Palace today. At noon, two old women arrived at the palace gate together in a car. They handed a large envelope to the guards, simply saying that it was "to be presented to the King." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The King is currently residing at Fort Belvedere Palace in Windsor Forest. The palace is closely guarded by the Royal Guards and local police. Two guards are stationed in front of the gate. Cars are allowed to pass as usual on the nearby road, but they are not allowed to stop in front of the gate. However, many people still deliberately slow down when passing the palace, wanting to catch a glimpse of the situation inside in that instant. At dawn today, a plane flew near the palace, quite close to the ground, and then flew away. The police tried to find out the origin of the plane, but they were unable to see clearly due to the hazy weather. By dusk, pedestrians had disappeared on the road near the palace. The King's car drove out of the palace at 5:30 PM, the curtains were lowered, and it was impossible to know who was inside. (National News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Mrs. Simpson Arrives Safely in Cannes, Southern France; Closes Her Doors to Guests Due to Travel Fatigue; Staying at the Home of American Friends, the Rogers; Reporters from Various Countries Fail to Meet Her</h3>
<p>Cannes, France Mrs. Simpson is currently staying at the home of American friends, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers. She is very tired from the long journey and is currently following the doctor's orders to rest in bed for two days in order to recover. (National News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Cannes, France After Mrs. Simpson arrived here the day before yesterday evening, she stayed at the villa of her friend, Mrs. Rogers-Rouviez. It is learned that Mrs. Simpson was accompanied on this trip by Lord Brownlow, the British King's private secretary. Newspaper reporters who went to the villa today to request an interview were still rejected. All that is known is that Mrs. Simpson will be staying here for a few days. What her future movements will be is still unknown. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Cannes, France After Mrs. Simpson arrived here last night, she stayed at the villa of her American friend, Mrs. Rogers. When the car carrying Mrs. Simpson drove into the villa, it was extremely fast, almost knocking down the newspaper reporters and photographers outside the gate. The reporters only caught a glimpse of the passengers in the car getting out and entering the room, but they could not distinguish how many people there were or what they looked like. Nothing has been revealed about Mrs. Simpson's daily life. It is only known that the room she is staying in is Mrs. Rogers' bedroom. There are many police officers and several police dogs guarding the outside of the villa. In the afternoon, two planes flew over the villa, but no one was seen inside. (National News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Cannes, France The world is paying close attention to Mrs. Simpson's secret passage through France yesterday. Today, after being exhausted from her travels, Mrs. Simpson was finally able to rest quietly, temporarily residing at the home of American friends, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers. It is rumored that because she cannot live quietly, she may go to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Philosovics in the village of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. However, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers hope that Mrs. Simpson will stay at their residence for a few more days. Mrs. Simpson is still keeping her movements a secret. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters has been entrusted to declare that Mrs. Simpson has not received any guests and has not made any statements during her time in England or while traveling in France. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Prompt Decision Versus Delay; Newspapers Argue; The Environment Does Not Allow Postponement</h3>
<p>(London) The constitutional disputes caused by the marriage issue are now dragging on, and the general public is quite anxious about it. This can be seen in the arguments of the newspapers this morning. Among them, the government faction and the Labour Party-affiliated newspapers advocate a quick solution, but the extreme conservative party and the free party advocate that the people should also participate in the matter, and not only the Congress should handle it alone.</p>
<p>The Times wrote, "We should not speculate on what the King will choose, but this issue should be resolved reasonably quickly. Whatever decision the King makes, as long as it does not cause more serious disputes within the Empire, it will be respectfully accepted by the people of the country. This is what the King understands."</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph wrote, "This issue should be resolved quickly. If it is delayed, the impact will only weaken the position of the Royal Family. The Royal Family should take unifying the subjects as its supreme responsibility. However, today, the British subjects have shown signs of division, which is regrettable."</p>
<p>The Labour Party's Daily Herald said, "If the current stalemate is delayed and unresolved, it will inevitably lead to a crisis. The people of the country have deep sympathy for the king. However, the marriage issue is not comparable to a private matter. The most important part of the civil system implementation method in the constitution, if it is not repealed, the King should adopt the views of the Cabinet. There have been demonstrations in Beijing in recent days to express loyalty to the king, but it is difficult to regard these people as advocates of the national system." The Liberal Party's News Chronicle advocates taking time to allow Congress and the people to consider the whole problem. In addition, the "Daily Mirror," owned by newspaper mogul Lord Rothermere, and the "Daily Express," owned by right-wing farm party vice chairman Piff Brook, issued strong arguments, saying that although the constitutional disputes caused by the marriage problem are expanding, the truth is unknown. The 45 million people of the United Kingdom now wish to hear the details." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Transfers; Large Fresh Troops; Includes German Elite Troops; Will Launch Another Major Offensive</h3>
<p>Madrid Yesterday, there was no change in the positions of both sides around the outskirts of the city. The government army's artillery units fired shells at the towns of Galapagar and Brunete in the southern suburbs. In addition, a large number of new troops have arrived in the Nationalist Army, and it is said that they plan to launch a major offensive soon to win the final victory. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Madrid Today, the Madrid newspapers reported that the elite troops of Germany's aid to the Nationalist Army have arrived in Spain, and the German commander has ordered an immediate attack on the capital. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Madrid The rebel army has besieged Madrid for a month. Today, government army fighter planes fought fiercely with rebel army bombers in the air, so that the rebel army planes could no longer drop bombs on the capital. It is said that two rebel planes were shot down. The Red Cross estimates today that 500 civilians have died unnaturally every day since January. However, the residents of the city still dare to go out to open spaces today for a Sunday walk and watch the aerial combat from afar. (National News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Congress Concludes; New Constitution Passed and Effective; Important Amendments Passed; Protects Private Property and Implements Democracy; Conditions for Declaring War Also Improved</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Eighth All-Soviet Special Congress held its final decision-making meeting in the Kremlin at 4:00 PM today, passing the full amended text of the draft of the new Soviet Constitution. Stalin rose to deliver a report on behalf of the Review Committee. The entire body of delegates and Laobao cheered, applauded, and cheered.</p>
<p>Stalin said in his speech, "The work of the Review Committee has been completed. The amended draft of the new Constitution has been distributed to all the delegates of the Congress. Therefore, the Congress Hall is well aware of its content. The Review Committee has cited 43 amendments and modified 32 articles of the original draft. The other 114 articles remain unchanged from the original draft.</p>
<p>"The first is the amendment to Article 8 of the original draft. The original draft said, "Collective farms occupy land for a period of use without restriction, that is, permanent occupation." The amended provision says, "Collective farms occupy land for free use, and there is no restriction in the interval, that is, permanent occupation." The significance of this amendment is clear and does not need to be explained.</p>
<p>"The second is the amendment to Article 10. The original draft stated, "Personal property such as citizens' work income, savings, household items and appliances in their residences and household-affiliated economy, and personal items for use and enjoyment are protected by law." The amended text states, "The right to personal property such as citizens' work income, savings, household items and appliances in their residences and household-affiliated economy, and personal items for use or enjoyment, as well as the right to inheritance of citizens' personal property, are protected by law." The significance of this amendment is clear and does not need to be explained further.</p>
<p>"The third amendment concerns Article 35. The original text of this article stated that the National Council is organized by representatives elected by the Supreme Council of each federal republic and autonomous republic, and by the Soviet representatives of the toilers of each autonomous province. Each federal republic sends 10 representatives, each autonomous republic sends 5 representatives, and each autonomous province sends 2 representatives." The amended text reads, "The National Council is composed of representatives elected by Soviet citizens of each federal and autonomous republic, each autonomous province, and each national district through universal suffrage. Each federal republic elects 25 representatives, each autonomous republic elects 11 representatives, each autonomous province elects 5 representatives, and each national district elects 1 representative." Thus, this article is fully in line with the equality of the two houses and the principle of equal use of democratic methods to form.</p>
<p>"The fourth is the amendment to Article 40. The original draft of this article stated, "The laws passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union shall be signed and promulgated by the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and the Secretary of the Presidium." The amended text states, "The laws passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union shall be signed and promulgated in the languages of each federal republic by the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and the Secretary of the Presidium." The significance of this amendment is clear and does not need to be explained. As a result, all laws will be promulgated in eleven languages.</p>
<p>"The fifth is the amendment to Article 48. The original draft stipulates that the Supreme Soviet shall have four vice-chairmen. The amendment changes it to eleven vice-chairmen, which is equal to the number of federal republics.</p>
<p>"The sixth is the amendment to Article 77, which suggests that a People's Commissariat for the National Defense Industry be added to the existing all-Union People's Commissariats. This amendment does not need to be explained.</p>
<p>"The last amendment concerns Article 49癸. The original draft said, "During the adjournment of the Supreme Soviet, the Presidium shall declare war if the Soviet Union is attacked by armed forces." The amended text says, "During the adjournment of the Supreme Soviet, the Presidium shall declare war if the Soviet Union is attacked by armed forces, or if it is necessary to fulfill the obligations of an international mutual assistance treaty to resist aggression." (Heavy applause) This article was amended in response to French protests.)</p>
<p>"Other amendments are not of a substantive nature and are purely of a linguistic nature, so there is no need to analyze them in detail."</p>

The Stalinist Constitution is the embodiment of the power of our system. This Constitution raises our flag for the struggle for peace to a higher level and further strengthens the glory and prestige of the Soviet Union as a pillar of peace, authorizing the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to declare war in the event that the Soviet Union is attacked by armed forces, or in the event that it is necessary to fulfill the obligations of an international mutual assistance treaty to resist aggression.</p>
<p>The Truth Daily said, "It is entirely right to call the new Constitution of the Soviet Union the Stalinist Constitution. This document is a masterpiece of genius and has opened up a new era for human life. It will be immortalized in history with the name of Stalin. The passage of this Constitution is an extremely important step in further strengthening the socialist system and the Soviet regime. Whoever dares to harm our system and our country will suffer the consequences. The Soviet Union is the only country that consistently advocates peace, but if the fascist jackals dare to disturb our peaceful work, they will sentence themselves to death. The Soviet people have now sworn, after passing the new Constitution, to defend it with their last drop of blood. (TASS dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Pan-American Conference: The United States Promotes Neutrality Policy, Establishes a Consultation Convention, and Forms Two Committees to Ensure Peaceful Resolution of Disputes Among Nations</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department announced today that Secretary of State Hull will propose at the Pan-American Conference tomorrow the establishment of an American Consultation Convention to adjust existing treaties among American countries. Its powers are twofold: to determine the state of war and to decide whether non-belligerent countries can invoke neutrality laws. Hull's motive in presenting this case is to promote the U.S. Neutrality Act to all republics in the Western Hemisphere. The preamble to this convention includes the Kellogg-Briand Pact initiated by Kellogg and Briand, the American Conciliation Convention signed in Washington on January 5, 1929, the Arbitration Convention, and the Saavedra Lamas Pact signed in the capital of Chile on October 10, 1933. It also organizes a committee consisting of the prime ministers or foreign ministers of the American countries. If disputes arise among countries, mediation will be conducted before invoking the treaty. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Capital of Argentina: The U.S. delegation to the American Peace Conference recently proposed that countries in North, Central, and South America sign a neutrality convention so that when disputes arise among the signatory countries, they can be resolved peacefully. It also establishes two committees: one is a permanent committee composed of the foreign ministers of the signatory countries, and the other is the American Advisory Committee, whose task is to ensure the implementation of the neutrality agreement. The draft convention proposes that when disputes arise among North, Central, and South American countries, the parties concerned should resolve them through diplomatic channels or jointly organize investigation, mediation, and arbitration committees. If a compromise cannot be reached, an appeal must be made to the American Advisory Committee. If disputes still cannot be resolved, even if war breaks out, all neutral countries, that is, all signatory countries other than the parties concerned, should issue orders to prohibit the transportation of military supplies to the warring countries and should refuse to provide financial assistance. In addition, each neutral country may decide on various commercial sanctions to deal with the warring countries. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>Mexico Allows Trotsky to Reside</h3>
<p>Mexico City: Leon Trotsky, the exiled leader of the Soviet Russian Communist Party's anti-faction, was formerly restricted in his movements in Norway after the Soviet Russian counter-revolutionary case occurred. Recently, through the mediation of his follower Rivera, the Mexican Foreign Ministry has specially approved his residence in Mexico. Although the General Confederation of Labor and other workers' groups expressed their opposition, it was ultimately ineffective. The Ministry recently issued a statement on this matter, stating, "Mexico has always adhered faithfully to the principles of international law, especially the right of political prisoners to seek asylum in other countries, which is a matter of pride. In accordance with this principle, Trotsky is specially allowed to reside here. It is an overestimation to say that Trotsky's arrival here will cause internal strife or lead to international disputes. On the contrary, the government will monitor Trotsky at all times and prevent him from interfering in internal affairs." The statement concluded by saying that, as of now, Trotsky himself has not formally requested to reside in Mexico from the Mexican government. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>

Since suffering from cerebral anemia four years ago, my blood pressure has been very high. I feel that my sick body cannot bear the heavy responsibility, and I have also received advice from doctors, so I have decided to take this action. I had intended to retire at the end of last year and in the spring of this year, but the February 26th Incident occurred, so I did not carry it out. Now there is an opportunity to leave. In the future, I plan to travel and pay attention to recuperation. As for my successors, especially in economic groups such as the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the All-Production Federation, and the Economic League, I plan to have each person succeed to one position separately. If my term of office in the House of Peers still had two or three years left, I would not resign. After recuperating for three or four months and regaining my health, I can assist the financial world as an individual in the private sector." (Domei News Agency Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>US Financial Shortfall of 3 Billion Dollars</h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Department of Commerce predicted today that the federal government budget deficit would increase to $3,000,000,000 by June 30, 1937, due to huge political and relief expenditures. Currently, due to commercial prosperity and reduced unemployment, relief expenditures are only 65% of the same period last year. The business tax has now been abolished, but revenue in the first five months of this fiscal year increased by $175,000,000 compared to the same period last year. This increase has reduced the budget deficit by $450,000,000 compared to the same period last year. The Department of Commerce also stated that income tax revenue could still increase, so it is expected that the budget deficit of $300,000,000 may still be reduced. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>The Pope is Gradually Recovering</h3>
<p>Vatican City: It was announced here today that Pope Pius XI is generally in good spirits and sleeping well. He received several visitors yesterday. A Vatican spokesman told an Associated Press reporter at 2:00 a.m. this morning that the Pope's strength is gradually recovering. However, the fact that the four major cathedrals of the Vatican were ordered to pray for the Pope's health today clearly contradicts the above news.

It is also reported that various religious organizations in Rome have also notified believers to offer special prayers for the Pope's early recovery. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>Western Anhui Suffers from Severe Drought</h3>
<p>No Major Rain for Three Months; Tens of Thousands of Disaster Victims Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>Bengbu Communication: The major products of western Anhui are bamboo, wood, tea, and hemp. The area has always been known as a rich and prosperous region. However, since the Red Bandits ravaged and disturbed the area for four years, the people have suffered惨罹 and the local vitality has been lost. After the Red Bandits were eradicated, it was hoped that the rural areas would be restored and the people would recover, but there was a severe drought last year and a spring famine this year.

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Clearing Overdue Land Tax</p>
<p>The county has a total of over 1,091,680 mu of cultivated land, with a land tax quota of over 1,162,670 yuan. However, due to successive years of poor harvests, the full amount has not been collected, resulting in a large accumulation of arrears. After exempting the arrears up to the 15th year, the accumulated arrears from the 16th to the 24th year amounted to over 858,831 yuan. Now, the county government, considering the people's financial capacity, has decided to clear and recover the arrears gradually over the years.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Permit Dispute</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers operating at the train station in Wuyi County are required to have a small permit issued by the rickshaw companies. This permit costs five jiao (cents) of silver dollars per month and is not collected from the rickshaw pullers. Recently, the rickshaw companies suddenly violated this established practice and started charging each rickshaw puller an additional two fen (cents) per permit per day. As a result, the rickshaw pullers are unwilling to pay and have voluntarily returned their permits to the companies. As a result, none of the rickshaw pullers are operating at the station, causing great inconvenience for passengers arriving and departing. This situation has persisted for several days. The railway authorities telegraphed the Shanghai Railway Bureau and the party and government organs for instructions. The county party headquarters, in order to maintain current transportation, had committee member Wang Chao invite County Magistrate Hou Lizong and Public Security Bureau Chief Xu Baoguang to discuss solutions at the Farmers' Association on the 6th. The result was a notification to the rickshaw pullers' union to inform all rickshaw pullers to resume operations at the station without permits. The permit fee issue will be resolved at a party and government meeting. In addition, a telegram will be sent to the Shanghai Railway Bureau to cancel the small permits. Upon hearing the news, the rickshaw pullers resumed operations at the station that day, and transportation was restored.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Gradual Dredging of the Shajiang River</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department has proposed that the Huai River Diversion to the Sea Engineering Office implement the dredging of the Shajiang River, the New River, and the Chaimi River in two phases. The first phase involves the construction of embankments along the Shajiang River, the New River, and the Chaimi River, as well as partial straightening of the New River and the Chaimi River, requiring a total of 236,560 yuan. The second phase involves dredging the New River, the Chaimi River, and the Wanggong River, requiring a total of 250,006 yuan and 83 fen. The total cost for both phases is 486,766 yuan and 83 fen. Investigations show that the terrain in the area along the river is low-lying and has long been subject to flooding from the Yi and Mu Rivers, resulting in disasters nine out of ten years, causing extreme suffering for the people along the river, who are eagerly hoping for a solution. The first phase of the embankment construction project seems to be of urgent necessity, but the total cost still requires more than 230,000 yuan, which is difficult to raise. A special request has been submitted to the provincial government for approval. Chairman Chen submitted it to the provincial government meeting for discussion, and it was decided to postpone it until next year. The dredging of branch rivers and other projects that can be handled by the county will be guided by the Construction Department to the county government, which will handle them according to the labor service method.</p>

<h3>Our Supervising Office for Students Studying in Japan Takes Action to Stop Students from Skipping Grades; Liu Zhong Forges a Certificate and Is Sent Back to China</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Tokyo) Chen Juepu, the supervisor of Chinese students studying in Japan, has been actively rectifying the affairs of students studying in Japan since taking office, making every effort to do so. Those who seek to skip grades by improper means are strictly punished. Recently, Liu Zhong, a student from Yexian County, forged a graduation certificate from the Chaoyang Ning College in Beiping and requested registration and introduction from the office. After investigation, he was reported to the Ministry of Education for sending him back to China. Afterwards, in order to warn students studying in the East, Supervisor Chen issued a notice to serve as a warning for the future. The original text of the notice is as follows: "Since the beginning of my tenure, I have declared the policy of upholding morals, encouraging learning, and rectifying discipline, hoping that students studying in the East will encourage each other to cultivate profound knowledge, noble character, and a spirit of perseverance in order to achieve the goal of serving the country and gaining a reputation overseas. I have also visited the Japanese authorities and related universities to unify the introduction and eliminate the malpractices of improper admission. The fifth notice of November 28 last year used extremely painful words to admonish students studying in the East to cherish themselves and not damage the reputation of the whole body for their own convenience. Otherwise, they will be severely sanctioned in accordance with the orders of the Ministry. All students studying in the East should be able to recall that in the past year, most of the Japanese related schools, except for one or two schools that seem to have not yet understood the policy of this office, have tightened their management of students studying abroad. Those who are expelled for misconduct or excessive absenteeism have also been reported from time to time. This supervisor is both happy and worried, and is planning to work together to improve and seek the improvement of the academic atmosphere. However, recently, Liu Zhong, a student from Yexian County, came to the office to present a graduation certificate from the Chaoyang College in Beiping for registration and introduction. Although the content of the certificate, including the Ministry's seal, the school's seal, and the impression, are all available and lifelike, upon closer inspection of the student's language and demeanor, there are doubts. After consulting the Chaoyang College, it was confirmed that it was a forgery. The case was then reported to the Ministry of Education for verification. On November 3, we received an order stating that all the presented documents were understood. The student Liu Zhong forged a graduation certificate and official seals, violating criminal law. The office was ordered to find a way to order the student to return to China for investigation in accordance with the law, and the forged certificate was stored in the Ministry for cancellation. According to this order, officials were dispatched from the office on the 20th of this month at 9:00 to escort the student to Yokohama to take the Rokko Maru back to China, and a letter was sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to transfer him to the Ministry of Education for investigation. Since the revolution in our country, everything has been waiting to be done, and the most lacking is talented and knowledgeable people. The cultivation of talented people depends entirely on gradual progress year by year. There is no possibility of skipping grades and achieving success in one fell swoop. Although the reasons for students holding forged certificates to request registration and introduction from the office are different, they are all trying to obtain graduation qualifications from Japanese schools by deceptive means and compete with those who have worked hard for years to obtain the same status after returning to the country. However, this is really too extravagant. How can the way of learning allow skipping grades? Why do the education systems of various countries in the East and West specify the time limit and system? Elementary and middle school students can also take any titles and positions. This is the first reason why it is impossible. Furthermore, the certificate presented by the student concerns his personal academic achievements and the reputation of the country. If the authenticity is not distinguished and good and bad are mixed, who in the country will be willing to work hard? The resulting malpractice will inevitably lead to a competition for falsehood, making the country's education, culture, and social order unbearable to ask, and the country's reputation and international credibility will also be swept away. This is the second reason why it is impossible. Recently, there have been many criticisms of the academic achievements of students studying in Japan from the United States. The reason is that a few students know how to be opportunistic and do not value practicality, resulting in a decline in the value of all students. On the other hand, the so-called domestic schoolwork is booming, but the name does not match the reality, and it is despised by others, making the domestic education level suffer from criticism. This is the third reason why it is impossible. At a time when the country is striving for construction, eliminating falsehood and advocating practicality is an important creed of the New Life Movement. How can students studying abroad be unaware of this? Now, or just arrived in the neighboring country, they disregard the country's laws and regulations. Even if they are lucky enough to be admitted, they deceive teachers and friends, deceive the country and society, and deceiving others is deceiving themselves. Their minds are not worthy of asking. In the future, when they return to the country to serve, they have no strength to deal with it. If they don't shirk responsibility, they will be perfunctory, or even delay national affairs, ruin their lives, harm others, and eventually harm themselves. The relationship between public and private is even greater. This is the fourth reason why it is impossible. Confucius said, 'If the name is not correct, the words will not be smooth.' It is said that 'the name is only a tool, and it cannot be used by a false person.' The certificate is a tool with official seals, school seals, and registration of subjects, levels, and titles of the country and society. Can it be forged, stolen, and used at will? Is it different from sitting idly by while villains and traitors steal people's property, disrupt the country's politics, and fail to stop them? This supervisor loves the country more than his life, and loves the students as his children. His duties are to not be perfunctory and evasive, to not nitpick, but to not condone evil. Ma Su was beheaded and the three armies obeyed. Zhuang Jia was executed and the Qi army was disciplined. A viper stings the hand, and a hero cuts off his wrist. Take the benefit of its weight and choose the light of its harm. National law and private feelings are difficult to balance. There is a definite conclusion about merits and demerits. In short, all the gains and losses that concern the country and the students' future are done with all my heart and effort, and I will not hesitate to work hard or complain. Now that Liu Zhong has left, it is impossible to recover. I hope that the students studying in the East will take this as a warning, persuade each other, advocate practical learning, and not let this unfortunate thing happen again and again. You must know that our future loyalty and bravery to serve the country is based on the current self-improvement. If you are ignorant of the gains and losses, take advantage of the moment, and hope that you can deceive and take false names, you will damage the reputation of all students studying in the East and cause endless worries for the country. Not only will the national laws and regulations not forgive you, but also the academic circles at home and abroad will abandon you. I hope you will encourage each other." The notification is issued for public knowledge on November 25th, 25th year of the Republic of China, Supervisor Chen Chipu.</p>

<h3>Overview of Educational Expenditure in Zhejiang Province in the Last Eight Years</h3>
<p>A Definite Standard Was Established Starting in the 22nd Year</p>
<p>Educational expenditure in Zhejiang Province can be divided into two categories: business expenditure under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education and business expenditure not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education. The former is compiled by the Department of Education into a general budget for each year's revenue and expenditure and sent to the Department of Finance for compilation into the provincial local revenue and expenditure budget book, which is submitted to the provincial government meeting for approval and then submitted to the central government for approval. The provincial treasury allocates funds according to the amount. Since the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, the amount of business expenditure under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education in the most recent eight years has increased or decreased with the prosperity or shortage of the provincial treasury, which has greatly affected the advancement of educational undertakings. In November of the 22nd year, the Department of Education and the Department of Finance jointly discussed and formulated 11 articles of the Zhejiang Provincial Educational Expenditure and other funds management and payment methods, which were submitted to the provincial government meeting for discussion and promulgation and reported to the Executive Yuan for record. Since then, educational expenditure has had a definite guarantee and has not been drastically reduced as in the three years from the 21st year onwards. The budget amount for the provincial educational expenditure in the province's most recent eight years from the 18th year to the 25th year is recorded below: (1) 2,392,173 yuan in the 18th year, (2) 2,636,951 yuan in the 19th year, (3) 2,839,238 yuan in the 20th year, (4) 2,273,025 yuan in the 21st year, (5) 2,106,436 yuan in the 22nd year, (6) 2,275,958 yuan in the 23rd year, (7) 2,380,844 yuan in the 24th year, (8) 2,835,337 yuan in the 25th year.</p>

<h3>Donations from Schools to Support Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Students of the Wenwei Primary School, a private school in the city, have been voluntarily carrying out a "one coin a day to support Suiyuan" campaign since November 23.

Student representative Zhou Ronggen handed over the money to the Shen Bao for forwarding. It is also reported that the students of the school have decided to continue their fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>An electricity cable from the Qijiang County Middle School in Sichuan transmits to Chairman Chuan of the Suiyuan Provincial Government: "The Japanese invaders are rampant, and bandits are invading our country, falsely claiming to be anti-communist, to encroach upon our Suiyuan border. Your Excellency has strengthened your troops and fought bravely, finally defeating the powerful enemy. We admire your lofty righteousness. We have specially saved food and raised funds, totaling 57 yuan and 4 jiao, which we are sending along with this letter. Compared to a pot of soup, this contribution is meager, but our sincerity is genuine."</p>

<h3>China Youth Basketball Registration Begins Today</h3>
<p>Still Divided into Four Divisions, Deadline on the 19th</p>
<p>The basketball tournament organized by the Shanghai YMCA every year (the 7th edition this year) will continue to be held. Le Xiurong, Zhou Jiaqi, Wang Ruisheng, Li Feiyun, and Cao Tingzan have been appointed as committee members. The regulations have been slightly revised, with the aim of giving each team the opportunity to compete. Therefore, only teams that have not participated in other league competitions of other basketball associations, such as the Sports Advancement Association, the Municipal Association, and the Western Youth Association, are eligible to participate. This year, the tournament is still divided into four divisions: school, commercial, bank, and women's. If there are too many teams in each division, they will be further divided into groups. However, divisions with fewer than four teams will not be held. The competition method will be a single round-robin system. For the award method, the champion team of each division will be awarded a silk banner by the association. If there are more than ten teams in each division, an additional award will be given to the runner-up, and each team member will receive a medal. Registration starts today and ends on the 19th. Each men's team is limited to ten players, and each women's team is limited to fourteen players. Each team must submit a full team photo. Copies of the regulations are available upon request. Those who wish to join can obtain them from the association's office at the Sichuan Road branch.</p>
<h3>University Sports Federation To Hold Cross-Country Race Today, Starts at 3:00 PM in Front of Guanghua School Gate, A Total of Five Universities Participating in the 3.5-Mile Race</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangnan University Sports Association was reorganized into the Shanghai University Sports Federation, all work has followed the old rules. The first cross-country race was originally scheduled for the 5th, but due to incomplete planning, it was changed to today (the 8th) at 3:00 PM. The race will start in front of the Guanghua University gate on Da Xi Road. The total distance is 3 and a half miles (i.e., 3.5 miles). Five schools have registered to participate, including Fudan, Jinan, Chizhi, Tongji, and Guanghua. Each school is limited to ten registrants. The scoring quota is limited to the top six finishers from each school, calculated using the inverse method, i.e., the first place gets one point, the second place gets two points, and so on. The team with the fewest total points wins the championship. The competition will be held as scheduled, rain or shine. In the last edition (i.e., the last edition during the Jiangnan University era, held in Zhenru), the championship was won by the Fudan team, and the individual champion was from Jinan. This year, Fudan still has the most even strength, so the hopes are still high. The race numbers have not yet been assigned because the team rosters have not yet been submitted completely. They will be assigned temporarily today. The route and the rosters that have been submitted are listed below:</p>
<p>Route</p>
<p>From the Guanghua school gate, head west, passing through Zhongshan Road, Da Xi Road, Fales Road, Hongqiao Road, Bilan Road, Lincoln Road, then return to Da Xi Road, turn to Zhongshan Road, and return to the starting point. The total distance is 2 and a half miles.</p>

<p>Guests Attending Yesterday Evening The guests attending last night included Ambassador Wang, Gao Leibo, Wang Chonghui, Chu Minyi, Wei Daoming, Li Shizeng, Liu Yunfang, Xiao Jinfang, Zhu Changnian, Zhao Jinqing, Qu Wenliu, Wang Yiting, Wu Kaisheng, Guo Bingwen, Dai Baoxun, Tai Shuangqiu, Chu Huiseng, He Zhenya, Su Xin, Commercial Counselor of the French Embassy, French Vice Consul Blionfan, Deputy Principal of the Sino-French Institute Xi Peide, and over a hundred others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech Chairman Chu Minyi delivered a farewell speech, stating that culture is the soul of a nation. With increasingly close international relations, it is necessary to study each other and give full play to the cultures of various countries in order to promote and enhance them, striving for the unification of world culture and working for international peace. Ambassador Wang has always been extremely dedicated to cultural endeavors. In addition to diplomatic negotiations, it is hoped that he will also strive for Sino-American cultural exchange. Gao Leibo has been engaged in education in China for many years. Although their missions are different as they return to their respective countries today, their common goal is to promote culture. I extend my best wishes to them.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Reply Subsequently, Ambassador Wang stood up to express his thanks, stating that he deeply sympathized with the points made. Countries in the East and West have their own cultures. Similarities should be used to facilitate communication, and differences should also be addressed. In the 20th century, transportation is convenient, and learning foreign languages is a tool for transporting culture. European and American universities now have departments of Eastern Studies, but this is still not enough. The China-Foreign Cultural Association's efforts in exchanging culture are deeply appreciated. I wish the association progress and success. Finally, Gao Leibo replied with thanks, and a photograph was taken. The gathering concluded in a happy atmosphere at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Huang Fu's Body Moved to Funeral Parlor Yesterday, Encoffining Held This Afternoon, President Yu and the American Ambassador and Others Paid Their Respects Yesterday, Chairman Lin, President Jiang, and Others Sent Telegrams of Condolence, Burial Site to be Selected at Moganshan, Memorial Service and Funeral Date Undetermined</h3>
<p>After the death of National Government Committee member Huang Fu at his residence the day before yesterday, his body was moved to the Chinese Funeral Parlor on Haig Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. The encoffining is scheduled for 3:00 PM this afternoon. Chairman Lin, President Cai, and others have sent telegrams of condolence. Many people paid their respects yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Moving to the Funeral Parlor</p>
<p>Huang's body was originally scheduled to be moved to the funeral parlor at 10:00 AM yesterday. However, the Huang family, following Buddhist customs, believed that the body should not be moved while it was still warm. Therefore, it was delayed until 3:00 PM in the afternoon, when a hearse was sent by the funeral parlor to take the body to the Number One Funeral Room. Technicians then performed embalming. No ceremony was held at the time. Only Madam Shen Jingying, Huang's wife, and his daughters, along with Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, Zhejiang Civil Affairs Director Xu Qingfu (who arrived yesterday), Financial Affairs Director Cheng Yuanfan, former Vice Minister Xu Xiuzhi, former Mayor of Beiping Yuan Liang, his relative Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Roads Bureau, and former subordinates Ge Jingyou, Ge Jingen, Zhao Shuyong, and others, followed to express their condolences and arrange everything. A spirit hall was set up in the main hall, with Huang's portrait placed on the altar, along with incense candles and offerings. The main entrance of the funeral parlor was decorated with plain-colored streamers.</p>
<p>Encoffining This Afternoon</p>
<p>The funeral parlor will send staff to guard the hall overnight. The encoffining will be held at 3:00 PM this afternoon. At that time, representatives from the party and government, as well as Chinese and foreign friends of Huang Fu during his lifetime, will attend the ceremony. According to Huang's relative, Shen Yi, Mr. Huang left instructions to his family before his death that the funeral should be kept simple and should not be Westernized. Therefore, the burial clothes, coffin, and all ceremonies should follow ancient customs. Mr. Huang liked to live in Moganshan during his lifetime and founded Mogan Primary School and other endeavors. To fulfill his last wishes, it is planned to be buried at the foot of Moganshan in the future. The date of the memorial service and burial has not yet been determined. It is not known whether the government will offer any preferential treatment, but the timeline will not be long, so that Mr. Huang's soul can rest in peace.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Suddenly Deploy and Increase Preparedness</h3>
<p>Shen Shi News: Yesterday, in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas, Japanese Marines again deployed and increased their defenses at key intersections on the streets of Hongkou and in the areas beyond the boundaries of the concessions.

<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Long-Distance Telephone Line Currently Under Repair</h3>
<p>Expected to be Completed Next Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance telephone line originally had two pairs of wires, A and B. Due to years of neglect, they have suffered considerable damage. It is learned that the Ministry of Communications, aware of this, has begun repairs. Therefore, only the A line has been actually in operation in recent days. The Shanghai-Hangzhou telephone service is quite developed, often leading to congestion. According to telephone bureau sources, the repair work is expected to be completed next month.</p>
<h3>National Products Groups Hold Joint Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Contributing Opinions to the Ministry of Industry, Requesting Increased Capital for Expansion of Chain Operations</p>
<p>In view of the small scale of the National Products Chain Company and its inability to accommodate the majority of domestic product manufacturers, the National Products Groups of this city, fearing biased treatment after its establishment, convened a joint meeting of all domestic product groups and factories in the city yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, convened by the China National Products Joint Association, to seek a solution. Several important resolutions were passed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Attending Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the China National Products Manufacturers Joint Association held a joint meeting of National Products Groups. The attendees included Xu Xiaochu, Liu Zhongying, and Zhou Zhaolin from the China National Products Manufacturers Joint Association; Cao Zhigong and Wan Futian from the Civil National Products Year Movement; Wang Hanqiang from the China National Products Maintenance Association; Lu Xingzhuang and Ma Jisheng from the Shanghai National Products Factory Joint Association; Zhu Yangwu from the China Products Improvement Society; and representatives from over 80 factories, including Taikang Company, Greater China Rubber Factory, Jiuxin Enamel Factory, China National Products Company, Huatong Electric Appliance Factory, and Minsheng Rubber Factory, totaling over 100 people. Wang Hanqiang was elected as chairman, and Zhou Zhaolin served as recorder.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report After the customary greetings, the chairman reported the significance of the meeting, stating that Wu, Minister of Industry of the National Economic Construction Association, had initiated the organization of the National Products Chain Company to promote domestic products, which was commendable. However, after reviewing the organizational regulations of the company and the composition of the preparatory committee, it appeared that the company would only support a small number of factories and would not be able to fully accommodate the majority of factories. To protect the interests of the majority of small and medium-sized factories, this association, fearing biased treatment and imbalanced development of the domestic products industry after the company's establishment, proposed that all attendees express their opinions to gather wisdom and benefit, collect public opinion, and advise the government to adopt and implement them to universally promote and achieve common development.</p>
<p>Resolutions After the chairman's report, the following resolutions were discussed and passed: (1) Petition the Ministry of Industry to expand the scope of the National Products Chain Company and increase the stipulated capital, which seemed insufficient, to 10 million yuan, with the government subscribing to 40% of the shares and the remaining 60% to be subscribed and raised by national product groups, chambers of commerce, national product factories, the financial community, and those enthusiastic about national products in various provinces and cities. (2) Petition the Ministry of Industry to state that the appointment of preparatory committee members for the chain company should be extended to national product groups, chambers of commerce, national product factories, and those enthusiastic about national products in various provinces and cities. (3) Jointly issue a declaration by national product groups requesting expansion of the organization. (4) Notify the factories under the various associations about the opinions of the National Products Chain Company for transmission to the Ministry for adoption. (5) Elect Cao Zhigong and Zhou Zhaolin to draft the declaration and official documents. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Ge Gu's Cold Weather, Ice Surrounds the Tai Shun, Please Send an Icebreaker for Assistance, Xin Ming Can Sail South</h3>
<p>Regarding Tianjin, the weather has been severe for days. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received telegrams from Tianjin stating that the waters inside Dagu Port had frozen. Starting from the 6th, the ice layer in the port between Dagu and Tanggu was very thick, hindering the passage of ships. The Tai Shun, a ship of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, with a deadweight of 1,962 tons, a length of 265 feet, and a draft of 16 feet 8 inches, had loaded a large shipment of grain and sundries from Shanghai to Tianjin. Yesterday morning, the ship sailed from Dagu Port and reached Gegu, located midway between Da Zha and Tanggu. Due to the thick ice layer in the port, the Tai Shun, lacking icebreaking equipment and having been built in 1896, now 40 years old, was unable to break through the thick, hard ice and was surrounded by ice. The entire ship was frozen and unable to proceed. Fearing danger to the crew, they telegraphed Shanghai yesterday to report the situation. At the same time, shipowner Sha Zengjia urgently telegraphed the Tianjin branch to request that an icebreaker be sent to Gegu to guide the Tai Shun to Zizhulin. The branch also telegraphed Tianjin for assistance. According to those familiar with the Beiyang waterway, if there is no strong northwest wind and if the temperature in Tianjin continues to drop, navigation will be at risk of being blocked by ice. It is reported that the Xin Ming, which had been blocked for six or seven days, was able to sail south yesterday due to a slight increase in the water level at Dagu Port.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce and Others Send Representatives to Petition for the Release of Detained Rice Boats, Gu Xinyi to Go to Zhenjiang This Morning to Petition the Provincial Government, Rice Detained for Days Has Reached Over 40,000 Dan</h3>
<p>Since Qingpu, Jinshan, and other counties under the Jiangsu Provincial Government have been detaining rice boats, a total of over 200 boats have been detained as of yesterday, carrying approximately 40,000 dan of rice. This has caused the Suzhou Creek, at the border between Shanghai and Jiangsu, to be crowded with detained rice boats, obstructing navigation. The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry believes that the detention of rice boats by Qingpu and other counties is inconsistent with the interim measures for food regulation passed by the Executive Yuan, which stipulate that food should be allowed to circulate freely within China to balance supply and demand, and that Shanghai's food supply is also affected. Therefore, they requested assistance from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association. The two associations agreed to the request and sent Gu Xinyi and others to Zhenjiang this morning to petition the Jiangsu Provincial Government for the release of the detained rice boats destined for Shanghai and to prevent future detentions. If this fails, they will go to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan. According to Gu, Shanghai's 3 million residents need 12,000 dan of rice per day. Since Shanghai is not a rice-producing area, it relies on continuous supplies from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces. If Jiangsu continues to detain rice boats bound for Shanghai, Shanghai's food supply will be greatly affected. The letters from the Local Association and others are recorded below.</p>
<p>Letters and Telegrams from the Local Association</p>
<p>The Local Association requested the Governors of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to release the detained rice boats. The letter to Chairman Chen of Jiangsu stated: "Chairman Guofu, I acknowledge receipt of the attached letter from the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, stating that Qingpu, Jinshan, Jiading, and other counties have detained rice boats leaving for Shanghai. I telegraphed your government on the [date] of last month and the [date] of this month to request that you order their release. It is now reported that approximately 200 ships carrying rice from Changshu, Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, and other counties passing through Jiading County's Jiwang Temple area have been detained, obstructing the Songjiang waterway. The Shanghai rice market is experiencing a disruption of supply, with some businesses already suspended and others inevitably raising prices and hoarding, causing widespread panic. It is believed that the free flow of grain was decided by the Executive Yuan long ago. Shanghai has a large population and requires a large amount of rice, which is supplied by other provinces. The current situation is even more urgent. Therefore, I am sending this letter with representatives from the association, Mr. Gu Xinyi, Mr. [?], and Mr. Jiang Jingwen, to present the case in person. I respectfully request a meeting. We are grateful. We wish you peace. Shanghai Local Association, December 7, 1936." Another telegram was sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Government: "On [date], we received a telegram from the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Association reporting that Yueqing and Pingyang counties had intercepted rice boats and requested that we investigate and order their release. We have received a letter from the association stating that 9,700 bags of white rice have been detained in the two counties for a long time and have gradually become moldy, and that the grain merchants are urgently demanding payment, making it difficult for them to turn over funds. They also stated that 5,000 dan of rice handled by Da Cheng in Zhenhai was also intercepted. Please expedite the release of these cases. It is believed that merchants are following the central government's decision to allow the free flow of grain and that it is not appropriate to obstruct the export of rice. Most of the rice market in Shanghai has been suspended due to a shortage of goods. If the ban is not lifted, not only will merchants face hardship, but it may also affect public order. We are sending this telegram again to request that your government order the counties detaining rice to release them separately and strictly order them not to repeat such incidents in the future. We urgently present this matter and respectfully request a response. Shanghai Local Association."</p>
<p>Detained Rice Boats Disrupt Traffic</p>
<p>Since Jiading County detained rice boats coming to Shanghai, the section of the Wusong River from Jiwang Temple to the Xinkai River has been crowded with ships, extending for over ten li. All inland river ferries traveling through the Wusong River to Wuxi, Changzhou, Changshu, Zhujiajiao, Qingpu, Shatou, and other places have been disrupted for five days. According to Wang Jianping, Director-General of the Inland River Shipping Industry Association of this city, the affected ferries are in a difficult situation to move forward or backward. All shipping companies operating on the Wusong River have been forced to suspend operations due to a lack of available ships, resulting in enormous losses from delayed passengers and cargo. The association has telegraphed the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, the Mayor of Shanghai Wu, and the County Magistrate of Jiading Guo today to request that they take steps to resolve the situation. The original telegrams sent by the association to the Ministry of Communications and the Provincial Government are recorded below: "To the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing and the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, since Jiading detained rice boats, traffic on the Wusong River has been disrupted for five days. Inland river ferries have all been suspended. Please order the unblocking to maintain traffic. Shanghai Inland River Shipping Industry Association."</p>
<p>City Party Headquarters Also Telegraphed a Request</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters believes that there have been frequent disasters in recent years, and the farmers' economy is exhausted. Although the provinces of Jiangnan and Central China were fortunate to have a bumper harvest this year, several provinces in the Northwest are still barren, and the supply does not meet the demand. This is enough to supply the national food supply, but there should be no exports to avoid domestic shortages during the lean months of next year. In order to maintain the people's food supply, the Party Headquarters telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters yesterday to request that the Executive Yuan be informed to instruct all customs offices to strictly prohibit the export of grain, to allow the free flow of domestic grain, and to urge the Jiangsu Provincial Government to implement the release of rice boats detained in Jiading as soon as possible to maintain the food supply of Shanghai residents.</p>

<h3>State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Opens Joint Transport, Documentary Bills, and Goods Delivery, Implementing Direct Joint Transport Between Shantou, Guangdong, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and Deciding to Collect Payment for Goods on Behalf of Customers Starting January 1st</h3>
<p>In order to seek convenience for cargo transportation and passengers, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has not only handled direct joint transport of water and land between ports such as Shantou, Guangdong, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and opened regular scheduled flights to Lianyun Port, but also implemented the opening of documentary bills and the collection of payment for goods on behalf of customers, creating a new record for state-run shipping joint transport. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Direct Joint Transport</p>
<p>In the past, the joint transport of water and land cargo on the Longhai Railway, all cargo exported from the Longhai Railway was transported by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Shantou, Guangdong, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Shanghai. However, cargo imported into the Longhai Railway, except for direct transport between Shanghai and Qingdao, required goods from other places such as Shantou, Guangdong, and Tianjin to be first reported to Shanghai for transport and then transshipped to Longhai. The handling time for transportation procedures was inevitably delayed. In order to facilitate merchants and speed up cargo transportation, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will transport joint transport cargo from Shantou, Guangdong, and Tianjin to Longhai. It only needs to sign a transport bill without using transshipment procedures for direct export. The cargo bill will be mailed by the local branch to the consignee at the destination. If transported to Lianyungang, it can also pass through Longhai. According to the railway joint transport transferring to Pinghan and Jinpu Roads, it can be transported. The scheduled flights for joint transport are stipulated to depart from Shanghai to Lianyungang on the 2nd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 16th, 19th, 22nd, 26th, and 29th of each month, and from Lianyungang to Shanghai on the 1st, 4th, 7th, 11th, 14th, 17th, 21st, 24th, and 27th.</p>
<p>Collecting Payment for Goods on Behalf of Customers</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the settlement of payments for goods between merchants in two places, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has specifically decided to collect payment for goods on behalf of customers starting on January 1st of next year. If a merchant in place B purchases goods from a merchant in place A and has not yet paid, the goods from place A can be transported to place B for the merchant to receive, and the merchant in place A will issue a payment bill, which will be settled and collected by personnel dispatched by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company without any handling fees, so that merchants can benefit from time and economy.</p>
<p>Documentary Bills and Goods Delivery</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has stipulated the "Notice to Merchants on Documentary Bills for Responsible Joint Transport of Water and Land Cargo," totaling 17 articles, which are summarized as follows: (1) This delivery order is a valuable security and has the same value as cash and can be used for collateralized lending or trading. Therefore, for the person delivering the goods, regardless of whether they are the consignee listed on the delivery order, as long as they hold the delivery order within the validity period of the delivery order and have the transfer column of the delivery order formally signed by the original consignor or the person signed by the original consignor, they have the right to deliver the goods. However, when the original consignor signs, they should also affix the same seal in the transfer column as the original consignment note and cargo ticket notice. (2) The validity period of the delivery order is limited to half a year from the date of issue. (6) For all goods for which delivery orders are issued, the delivery order must be submitted before the goods can be delivered. However, if the delivery orders are lost, the goods can be delivered upon expiration after formal declaration, or the goods can be delivered with a bank guarantee. Those who deliver the goods upon expiration must provide a guarantee and receive the goods within ten days after the expiration of the delivery order. Those who deliver the goods with a guarantee must pay cash for the total amount of the goods' value, freight, and miscellaneous fees listed on the delivery order, plus 30% of the total amount, and request the stationmaster of the station where the goods are located or the manager of the shipping bureau to receive the goods. Those who deliver the goods with a bank guarantee must obtain a "Bank Guarantee Letter" from a bank recognized by the railway or shipping bureau and request the stationmaster of the station where the goods are located or the manager of the shipping bureau to receive the goods. The amount of the bank guarantee should be the same as the total amount stipulated for the guaranteed delivery of goods. (9) The freight for all goods for which delivery orders are issued shall be paid in advance in principle. If the railway or shipping bureau allows payment on arrival, and no one claims the goods after they have arrived at the destination station or port, or the consignee refuses to accept the goods, the consignor shall still be responsible for paying the freight. (11) The railway or shipping bureau is responsible for compensating for losses of water and land transport goods for which delivery orders are issued as follows: (A) For losses caused by railway transportation and storage, the railway shall be responsible for compensation in accordance with the railway regulations. (B) For losses caused by ship transportation and storage, the shipping bureau shall be responsible for compensation in accordance with the shipping regulations. If the customs has special regulations and methods, they shall be followed. The transfer of ten liability items shall be based on the signing of the certificate of acceptance. (C) When the responsibility for the loss is unclear, the railway and the shipping bureau shall jointly be responsible for compensation, and the proportion shall be recognized according to the freight earned by the batch of goods. However, the maximum amount of compensation for which the railway is liable shall be the amount that should be shared and compensated according to the proportion of freight, and the maximum amount of compensation for which the shipping bureau is liable shall be 350 silver dollars per piece. (12) All claims for compensation for losses of goods must be submitted within six months from the date the goods arrive at the destination station or port. Overdue claims will not be accepted. (15) When goods are auctioned due to price changes, after deducting freight and miscellaneous fees, if there is any remaining payment, the merchant may provide a guarantee and receive the goods at any time within one year after the auction is established. If there is a shortfall, they must also be responsible for making up the difference. (16) The railway and shipping bureau shall be responsible for all compensation for goods for which delivery orders are issued, except for the following losses: (A) Those belonging to natural disasters and events that cannot be resisted by human power. (B) Those caused by improper packaging. (C) Those caused by natural burning, reduction, or corruption of goods.

<h3>Swire Tugboat and Hai Zhen Steamer Collide, Both Sides Suffer Major Losses, Responsibility for the Accident Must Be Decided Impartially</h3>
<p>Swire Company's large tugboat, Chuling, was towing three large iron barges loaded with tung oil from Hankou to Shanghai. At 7:14 pm on the 5th of this month, it arrived at the Faot Buoy river cylinder outside the Wusongkou battery. At the same time, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhen steamer (weighing 3,406 tons, 71, ship length 34 feet 3 inches, draft 17 feet 6 inches) was sailing to Shantou and Hong Kong. It was just sailing to the Faot Buoy river cylinder outside the Wusong battery when the Zhu Ting tugboat was also sailing with three barges. The Zhu Ting tugboat was tying the 13th barge to the tugboat to travel together, and the other two barges were being towed behind. When the three barges arrived in front of the river cylinder, their hulls turned and came around the river cylinder. The Zhu Ting number towed the two barges behind, and the wire cable was extended to more than 500 feet. The Hai Zhen steamer was near the river cylinder. It was observed that the waterway there and the river cylinder occupied about 750 feet, and the Zhu Ting's tow cable was across the waterway for 500 feet, completely blocking the route. Under this situation, the sailors urgently sounded the whistle and ordered the Zhu Ting and each barge to stop quickly. However, each barge had lost its position to advance or retreat and could not avoid it, but the Zhu Ting still drove across and violently collided with the Hai Zhen. The 13th iron barge, which was tied to the Zhu Ting towing transmission, had the most violent impact with the bow of the Hai Zhen steamer, causing the left side of the 13th iron barge to break immediately. Seawater flooded into the barge, and the loss of tung oil and cargo was huge. The barge was hit, and because the vibration force was very large, the Zhu Ting tugboat retreated backward. The two barges behind were advancing on the tow cable at a distance of 500 feet, so they were struck by the Zhu Ting and the 13th barge and collided with each other, causing the two barges behind to also suffer serious injuries. As for the bow of the Hai Zhen steamer, because it collided with an iron barge, four iron plates in the head cabin on the right side were dented very deeply, and the water cabin inside the bow (behind the anchor chain) was also broken, so the damage was also extremely serious. After the accident, both sides stopped the transmission. On one hand, the shipowner of the Hai Zhen steamer, Hu Xiyuan, and the towing personnel of the Zhu Ting jointly inspected the damaged areas. It took a total of six hours. After the situation was proved, the Zhu Ting towed the three barges to Shanghai to report to the company. All three barges were damaged, and the loss of cargo was huge. Yesterday, Swire reported to the cargo owners and carefully checked the amount of damage. The total amount is currently unknown. The Hai Zhen steamer's shipowner, Hu Xiyuan, telegraphed the truth of the accident to Shanghai in the morning of the 6th. Because the ship could still sail, it sailed to Shantou as usual. As for the water leaks and damage to the hull, it will be inspected after the goods are unloaded in Shantou. It is also unknown whether the goods have been damaged or destroyed. Yesterday, the bureau received a telegram from the sailors stating that the responsibility for this incident lies entirely with the Zhu Ting tugboat for violating the navigation regulations. Towing a ship with a 500-foot cable and blocking the route means that the responsibility for the accident lies entirely with the tugboat. Therefore, the bureau sent a letter to Swire requesting to reserve all compensation responsibilities. As for Swire, there has been no response. If the Navigation Administration Bureau makes a fair judgment, because the Zhu Ting belongs to a British merchant, it is feared that Swire may not agree. In the future, Chinese and foreign experts may be hired to form a fair judgment committee to handle the case.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhuxuan Case Will Be Continued Today</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the former owner of the Tianchan Stage, was suspected of inciting assassination in the Tang Jiapeng case. After being arrested, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison by the Second Special Court. When appealing to the Third Branch of the High Court, he bribed Wu Lu, the head of the detention center; Ma Xianxiang, the guard; Wang Yushou, the head of the Second Special Prison; and Ma Xianxian and Ma Xiancai brothers, the guards; and Wang Gang, etc., to buy and instruct Zhao Guangfu, who had already been sentenced to life imprisonment, and Zhang Xiaosizi to recant. After the case was discovered, the Ma brothers and the two Wangs escaped without a trace. Only Wu Lu and Ma Xianxiang were detained. After investigation by the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, it was found that Daya Bank did have a deposit of 2,000 yuan in Zhang Sen's name, and it was suspected that Gu's brother, Gu Songmao, was also involved. Therefore, the prosecutor, Wang Ren, filed a public prosecution against the Gu brothers, Wu Lu, Ma Xianxiang, etc., to the Criminal Court of the same court in accordance with the law. After Chen Shuoying, the judge in charge, opened a court session once, the case was retried. Because further investigation was still needed, and the defendant Ma Xianxiang had not returned to Anhui, the judge ordered that the hearing be rescheduled. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that Chen, the judge of the Second Special Court, has scheduled the case to continue the trial in the Second Court at 2 pm today, and has notified Gu Songmao and Ma Xianxiang and informed the defense lawyer Jiang Yiping to come to the court to await the hearing. There will definitely be a debate at that time.</p>

<h3>Matchboxes Used as Gambling Stalls</h3>
<p>Many People Gambling Inside Wuxi Fast Boat Cabins As Well</p>
<p>In the bow cabin of the Wuxi fast boat No. 12760 moored at the inner river China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau wharf in the north of Tianhou Palace Bridge, someone actually used it to set up a gambling stall and lure people to gamble at 2 pm the day before yesterday. The gambling tool was a matchbox used as a treasure stall. This gambling activity was called "grabbing treasure" and was able to attract dozens of gamblers, filling the cabin, and the gambling was strong. It happened that Huang Songsheng, an investigator from the Customs Water Patrol Room, and two Chinese constables, No. 74 and No. 114, learned of this, boarded the ship to surround and arrest them.

Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the local court for disposal.</p>
<h3>Cutting and Killing Hua Shih Hao: The Culprit Convicted</h3>

<h3>Fire Consumes Three Homes in Gujia Lane, Niuzhuang Road</h3>
<p>Caused by Birthday Candles</p>
<p>Inside a shikumen building at No. 3, Jifu Lane, Gujia Lane, Niuzhuang Road, in the Public Concession, lived three cotton fabric firms: Zheng Changxiang (upstairs), Heng Changxiang (downstairs eastern wing), and Qi Changxiang (western wing). The owners all lived in the shops with their families. The other day, Heng Changxiang's owner celebrated his 60th birthday with a banquet. Late into the night, after the guests had left, they forgot to extinguish the birthday candles.

She shouted an alarm, and the men, women, old, and young of the three families, along with the employees, were awakened from their sleep and fled in panic. Most did not have time to put on clothes. Fortunately, a tragic disaster was averted, but the goods in the stores, as well as valuables and luggage, could not be retrieved, and they escaped with their lives. The losses were enormous. Neighboring shops were spared due to the swift arrival and firefighting efforts of the fire brigade.</p>
<h3>Public Rickshaw Pullers Must Wear Numbered Jackets and Raincoats</h3>
<p>To improve the lives of rickshaw pullers, Article 16 of the Public Concession's rickshaw licensing regulations stipulates that each rickshaw owner must provide two numbered jackets and one raincoat. This matter was announced to all rickshaw companies by the Rickshaw Committee in early September of this year, and standard numbered jackets and raincoats were made and displayed at the rickshaw licensing office for rickshaw companies to follow. However, to ease the financial burden on the companies, existing usable numbered jackets and raincoats, even if they did not fully meet the prescribed standards, could be submitted to the licensing office for inspection and stamping for use. A total of 14,274 numbered jackets and 3,243 raincoats were approved under this arrangement. The remaining number required was fully supplied by mid-November. From now on, all public rickshaw pullers must wear numbered jackets to pull their rickshaws, and the number on the back of the jacket and raincoat must match the number of the rickshaw. Furthermore, the number of new-style public rickshaws in the Public Concession has reached 3,700, and it is expected to reach 4,000 by the end of this year.</p>

<h3>Westerner's Home Burglarized: Cook Falsely Accused and Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>Chen Yaosheng, 46, a local resident of a certain house in Caojiazhai, Bailinan Road, Huxi, worked as a cook for a Westerner at a certain house on the same road.

<h3>Li Guojie Case: Execution Hearing Continued Yesterday; Li and Duan Ling Headed to Beiping; Court Approves Postponement for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>Li Guojie, former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment with probation after the court's three trials concluded, for mortgaging the four wharves to the China General Edison Company and forfeiting navigation rights to foreigners. At that time, Li had allegedly bribed Supervisor Chen Fumu with 700,000 taels from the mortgage loan. To date, the principal and interest have reached over 1.2 million yuan. During the execution hearing in June, Yu Qiaqing and Li Sihao posted bail for Li to handle the matter, but no money has been paid to date. The creditor, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, also investigated and found only a small portion of the assets, less than one-tenth of the amount owed. Therefore, they continued to pursue the case and requested the court to declare Li Guojie bankrupt. However, Li, claiming to be a person of status, expressed his unwillingness. The court ordered him to provide assets within half a month, but Li still did not comply. Yesterday, Yu Lude, the judge of the court execution division, again convened a hearing. The defendant, Li Guojie, did not appear. Lawyer Jiang Yiping, representing Li, stated that the debtor had been assigned as a member and chief receptionist of Duan's funeral committee and had departed for Beiping today to transport the coffin, hence his absence. He requested a one-month extension. The judge asked if the defendant had contacted China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Jiang replied, "No." The judge asked if he had presented his assets. Jiang replied, "There are no fixed assets." The judge asked why he was delaying the matter despite the prior summons. He added that the funeral arrangements could be handled perfectly well even without Li Guojie. Jiang replied that Duan's funeral committee was organized by Chairman Jiang, who appointed Li as a member, and that the municipal government had sent an official letter to the court stating this. The judge said that the municipal government could not advise on this case, and that the court had received the letter but had replied stating that Li Guojie's reasons for requesting a postponement were not justified. Lawyer Jiang immediately stated that Li was indeed dispatched and not trying to delay the matter, requesting approval for a change of date. The judge then approved a postponement to a date determined by telegram to Li in Beiping, giving him the time required for travel to return. Just as the judge was about to adjourn, Jiang Heyi, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, arrived, stating that he was slightly delayed due to another court appearance at the First Special Court. The judge then showed Jiang the municipal government's letter and reply and instructed, "If he does not appear, we will have to handle it according to the law." He then asked if China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had investigated Li's assets. Jiang replied, "We are still investigating. As soon as we have verified it, we will report." The court then adjourned.</p>

<h3>New Pharmaceutical Industry: Notice Regarding Counterfeit Drugs</h3>
<p>The National Federation of New Pharmaceutical Industry Associations yesterday issued a notice to all members nationwide, stating: "Esteemed colleagues, the authenticity of drugs is crucial to patients' lives. However, unscrupulous individuals often counterfeit popular over-the-counter medicines and sell them in various ports, damaging the interests of the manufacturers. This is a small matter compared to the harm caused to the public, which is immense. The sale of counterfeit drugs damages customer trust and undermines the reputation of manufacturers and the business of sellers. If this is not thoroughly clarified, it will be detrimental to manufacturers, sellers, and buyers alike. Recently, it was reported that the Shanghai Special District cracked a case involving Gui Yaohua and Huang Futang of the Dadong Pharmacy manufacturing counterfeit products. Fifteen boxes of various counterfeit drugs were seized, and the extent of their harm is imaginable. Although the Dadong case has been solved, there is no guarantee that others will not continue to manufacture counterfeit drugs and test the law. Counterfeiting drugs violates Article 205 of Chapter 11 of the Criminal Law, which deals with crimes endangering public safety: 'Those who manufacture, sell, or display for sale items harmful to hygiene shall be sentenced to imprisonment or detention and may also be fined up to 1,000 yuan.' Moreover, due to the counterfeiting, Article 268 of Chapter 18, which deals with crimes harming agriculture, industry, and commerce, is also violated: 'Those who counterfeit registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names with the intention of deceiving others shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years and may also be fined up to 1,000 yuan.' Those who sell the counterfeit drugs, whether due to carelessness or greed for profit, also violate Article 269 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, the second general meeting of the association's members resolved to protect the reputation and rights of the industry and to safeguard the lives and health of the people. All members should pay close attention. If anyone discovers the manufacture of counterfeit drugs, they should sever ties with them to avoid being implicated. This notice is hereby issued for your information."</p>

<h3>Cloth Fraud Case: Criminal Chen Hongxiang Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Hongxiang, a native of Ningbo, 28 years old this year, falsely established the Dafeng Cloth Company at No. 24, Baoxing Lane, Fada Road, last year. He successively defrauded eight cloth factories or brokers, including Xi Yuntai and Tang Wanqi, of cloth, linen, and poplin worth 1,530 yuan and more. He sold the goods, spent the money, abandoned the company, and fled without a trace. The victims reported the matter to the French Concession Police, requesting an investigation, but he could not be found. Recently, Chen was hiding at No. 25, Peifu Lane, Lagena Road, in the French Concession. Chen owed Lyu Rongqing (28 years old), a broker from Jiaxing, 7 yuan in commission for advertising business that he ran in addition to the Dafeng Cloth Company. Recently, Lyu met Chen, and Chen invited Lyu to his home, intending to start another business. The afternoon before yesterday, Lyu asked Chen for the old debt of 7 yuan in commission. The two had an argument, which escalated into a fight. Lyu was beaten by Chen. Lyu reported the matter to the French Concession Police. Detective Wu Wengang learned that Chen was wanted under arrest warrant No. 418 issued by the Second Special Court for the cloth fraud case. He arrested Chen. Yesterday morning, Chen was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case and requested a postponement for further investigation before prosecuting. Judge Mi Chuzhe questioned the defendant and the witness Lyu Rongqing and ordered a postponement of 14 days for further investigation. The defendant was remanded in custody, and the witness Lyu Rongqing was ordered to appear in court for cross-examination at the next hearing.</p>
<h3>Another Water Gambling Den Broken Up: Over a Hundred Gamblers Flee at the Sound of the Alarm; Two Injured Jumping Ashore</h3>
<p>Balunshi, the criminal division chief of the Customs Water Police, learned the other evening that someone had secretly set up a water gambling den on the second deck of the stern of the Xianghe steamboat of the Jardine Company at Huashun Wharf in Hongkou. The gambling equipment included pai gow, big and small, and dice games. The scale was quite large. He immediately led a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives in two groups, one traveling by car along the shore to the wharf, and the other traveling by small boat to the outside of the ship. At the same time, they rushed onto the ship to make arrests. However, many lookouts were stationed around the ship. Upon seeing the detectives approach, they immediately raised the alarm. At that time, over a hundred gamblers were gathered at the gambling den, enjoying themselves. Upon hearing the alarm, they scattered and fled. Some even escaped by jumping down to the wharf from the bottom deck. Twenty-two male and female gamblers, including Ye Wo, were arrested on the spot. Among them, Jin Yusheng and Ding Xiangfa were injured while jumping onto the wharf from the side of the ship to escape. Jin broke his leg, and Ding injured his waist. They were taken to Renji Hospital by ambulance. After treatment, as their injuries were not serious, they were taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police questioned the arrested criminals and ordered them to be sent to the local court for interrogation this afternoon, along with the gambling equipment and gambling money.</p>

<h3>Chinese Invention: Energy-Saving Flat Light Bulb</h3>
<p>Long-Lasting Filament; Saves 30% Electricity</p>
<p>Electrician Pan Zuyin is an avid researcher with a strong background in light bulbs. He recently invented an economical flat light bulb. Due to its flat and round shape, the vacuum space is enlarged, which can extend the life of the filament, making it less likely to break. The glass shell never turns black, based entirely on scientific methods and electrical principles. It is very economical and durable. At the same time, it saves electricity and emits bright light, saving 30% more electricity than ordinary light bulbs. The copper head is plated with dazzling chrome, making it more luxurious and beautiful. The price is also very low, selling for only 10 cents of national currency each. Therefore, it is suitable for families, shops, organizations, and institutions. It is truly a rising new authority in the light bulb industry. It is exclusively managed by the China Light Bulb Company at No. 77, Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, French Concession, Shanghai. If customers purchase half a dozen, they can call and someone will deliver it. Local and out-of-town distributors are welcome to contact them.</p>

<h3>Public Security Bureau Cracks Down on an Agency Investigating Smuggling: Falsely Establishes a Smuggling Intelligence Office of the Ministry of Finance; Eleven Principals and Accomplices Arrested</h3>
<p>In order to prevent smuggling, the Ministry of Finance planned to organize a smuggling investigation intelligence office in the summer of this year. Since this was never implemented, a notice was published in the newspaper on September 27 announcing the cancellation and cessation of the organization. However, Mu Shiying from Dalian, Xiong Xiangtao from Hubei, Cao Fengwu from Anhui, and others, used the name of the Ministry of Finance Smuggling Investigation Intelligence Office, which had long been discontinued and abolished, to swindle money in various districts of the city.</p>
<p>Pretending to be</p>
<p>Mu Shiying, the principal offender, falsely claimed to be the leader of the special agent team three and forged letters of appointment, taking bribes to sell official positions. The price to buy the position of a special agent team leader was 1,000 yuan in foreign currency, while a detective cost 200 yuan. Over a hundred people, intoxicated with the desire for official positions, were deceived. Liu Huai, the captain of the investigation team of the Public Security Bureau, learned of this and used prudent and strict methods to conduct a thorough investigation. Detectives pretended to be willing to pay</p>
<p>large sums of money</p>
<p>to buy official positions. After several negotiations with the principal offender Mu Shiying, it was agreed that a fee of 150 yuan would be paid to become the accountant of the fake agency. After the agreement was made, at 7:00 PM on December 5, Mu summoned the key members of the fake agency for a banquet at the Taolechun Restaurant on the second floor of No. 2, Aiduya Road, to introduce them and exchange gifts. The Public Security Bureau immediately led</p>
<p>a large number of detectives,</p>
<p>together with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Public Concession's Laozha Police Station, to Taolechun at 7:00 PM on the 5th to make arrests. They arrested the principal offender Mu Shiying, the fake leader of the third special agent team, Xiong Jiangqing (also known as Xiong Xiangtao), the fake director of general affairs of the intelligence office, and the key criminals Gan Yulin (Gan Yulin), Yan Zishan, Li Qing, Hu Zhefu, Gao Shichang, Cao Mingqi (Cao Fengwu), Shu Guanlin, and nine others.</p>
<p>At Mu's residence,</p>
<p>they found 150 yuan in foreign currency, which was the bribe money pre-marked by the fake official-seekers from the Public Security Bureau's investigation team, as well as other related important documents and fake letters of appointment. The nine criminals were taken to the Laozha Police Station and questioned about their age, origin, and address. Mu Shiying, 50 years old, from Tianjin, living at No. 1, Sijing Lane, Daling Road, Xiong Jiangqing, 61 years old, from Hubei,</p>

At 10:00 PM, the nine criminals and the evidence were transferred to the Public Security Bureau. At 11:00 PM, at the fake third special agent team office at No. 5, Chunhua Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, they arrested</p>
<p>fake detectives</p>
<p>Xu Shaoqing and Xu Cixiang, and seized a fake handwritten order. A piece of iron plate with the name of the fake intelligence office communication office was removed from the door. The two criminals were taken to the Public Security Bureau for custody. Xu Shaoqing, 51 years old, from Anhui, and Xu Jiaxiang, 35 years old, from Anhui, lived with Xu Shaoqing at No. 5, Chunrong Lane, Qiujiang Road. Subsequently, a large package of documents and miscellaneous items was found in Mu's residence at No. 1, Sijing Lane, Daling Road. All the criminals are currently detained in the Public Security Bureau detention center pending further investigation. The evidence is stored in the investigation team for future reference, in order to continue searching for the remaining criminals.</p>

<h3>Overview of Industrial and Commercial Changes in Shanghai in September of the 25th Year (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit</p>
<p>(Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview, No. 39)</p>
<p>Here is a detailed table of the various industrial and commercial changes in Shanghai in September, for your reference:</p>
<p>Statistical Table of Industrial and Commercial Changes in Shanghai in September of the 25th Year (Unit: Household)</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Crabs of Jiading</h3>
<p>— (Qingqu)</p>
<p>The types of crabs vary from place to place. Although the production of crabs in my hometown of Jiading is not large, they are displayed in the market from spring to summer to late autumn, almost every day, but only in varying quantities. However, there are early and late crab seasons. The northeast of the city is earlier, and the crabs are on the market before the beginning of the north wind, usually around the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the fishermen are all competing to catch them first. However, the crabs at this time have just molted, their bodies are large, but the meat is not full, and the roe is not abundant. Those who really have a fondness for holding the claws do not cherish them, thinking that they are not worthy of the famous name of the "crab with a round belly in September and a pointed belly in October." The water source of the West Gate comes from Zhangpu, the river is wide and clear, so the crabs enter the market later, but they are definitely firm and old. Generally, this time is when the oranges are yellow and the chrysanthemums are blooming, and it is the time to climb high and stretch out, and the saying "when the west wind blows, the crab legs become hard" is not false. The best crabs are those produced in the Chuobang Township in the south of the city. Although they are later, they are all fat. What is even more strange is that the Gongsunjing in the south of the township has a "工" character on its back, and the Yangjing in the east of the township has a "王" character on its back, which are faintly discernible, and their bodies are slightly larger, and their feet are slightly smaller, and their taste is more exquisite. When cooking in a pot, try putting crabs from other places in it and make a note in advance. When you open the lid, the crabs with the "工" and "王" characters must be on top, otherwise they will be on the bottom, without exception. It can be seen that the solid ones can struggle, and the hollow ones will die when heated. The difference is self-evident. According to its origin, the water of the Chuobang River is between fresh and salt, so the weight of each male crab is less than a pound, but the shell is thin and the meat is thick, and there is no fishy smell, which is truly unique. It is a pity that they are not often seen in the market, and even if they are, they are sold as counterfeits. Connoisseurs are not deceived by this. Those who want to buy them go to the countryside and make reservations with the fishermen. Although the price is slightly higher, they are not stingy. Therefore, in the current Gongsunjing and Yangjing, among the Xiao Xiao reeds on both sides of the river, the fishing lights are flickering, and the small thatched huts are like deep trenches and high fortresses, waiting for the gutless gentleman to fall into them and be bound, and then presented as captives to the general gourmets.</p>
<h3>Orange Talk</h3>
<p>— Wolfo</p>
<p>Yanzi of Qi said, "Oranges, when grown north of the Huai River, turn into trifoliate oranges." Qu Yuan's Ode to the Orange said: "The late emperor esteemed good trees, and planted orange trees as a tribute. The mandate was not far off, for they were born in the south." It can be seen that oranges have been cherished by people since ancient times. During the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, an "orange official" was specially set up in Jiaozhi, with a rank of 200 shi, who was responsible for offering imperial oranges. This is also a glorious history of oranges. Since then, oranges have become the subject of poems, such as: "After writing, I want to inscribe three hundred oranges, and I have to wait for the frost to fill the forest in Dongting," "There are oranges in Jiangnan, and they are still in the forest in winter," "Slaves in the mountains have thousands of orange trees," etc., and I can't remember them all.</p>
<p>Oranges are evergreen shrubs, botanically classified as Rutaceae. They bloom with five white petals in summer and bear fruit in early winter, which is oblate in shape and green in color. After the frost falls, they turn red or yellow before they can be eaten. Since the opening of the sea ban, we have increased our enjoyment of oranges. Taking Shanghai as an example: in addition to the "Fuzhou oranges" produced in Fuzhou, there are also "Guangzhou oranges" transported from Guangzhou and "honey oranges" transported from Siam. Since honey oranges have invaded the domestic market, Fuzhou oranges, Guangzhou oranges, etc. have all been eclipsed. More than ten years ago, the calligrapher Taitaishan Nong planted thousands of orange trees on Taitaishan, known as "Taitai Honey Oranges." Because of the delicious taste of the oranges and the evaluation of the literati, the sales were very good. Unfortunately, Shan Nong was planning to promote them when he passed away, and the orange fields were abandoned. Fortunately, the people of Taizhou have learned about the benefits of planting oranges and have planted them one after another, so Taizhou honey oranges still occupy a place in the Shanghai fruit market and compete with Siamese honey oranges. Then, when we eat Taizhou honey oranges, we can't forget the pioneering work of Shan Nong. In addition to the above-mentioned areas, the orange-producing areas in our country also include "Nanfeng oranges" produced in Nanfeng County, Jiangxi, and "Dongting Reds" produced on the east and west mountains of Dongting Lake, which are also excellent oranges. It is said that the best Nanfeng oranges are those produced in Guobeiyuan, and their size is equal to Dongting Reds. Now the farmers in Guobeiyuan, Nanfeng, have organized a transportation and sales cooperative to improve the way of transporting and selling to other places, and people in Shanghai can also buy them.</p>
<p>The so-called "Flag Honey Oranges" produced in the United States are available in all seasons because they use scientific storage and cultivation methods. This is enough to break the saying that oranges turn into trifoliate oranges when grown north of the Huai River. Science is omnipotent, is there still any doubt?</p>
<p>Qu Yuan's Ode to the Orange also has a section that says: "Deeply rooted and difficult to move, more firmly determined, green leaves and white flowers, how delightful they are, branches with sharp thorns, fruits in the garden, green and yellow intertwined, how brilliant they are, the essence is white inside, like a path that can be taken, well-organized and suitable for cultivation, beautiful and not ugly." It is said that Qu Yuan used the qualities of the orange to symbolize his own personality, saying that he has a firm will, brilliant writing, and a beautiful essence. Now we need to save the country with personality, so when we eat oranges, we must pay attention to our own personality, and don't be inferior to oranges.</p>
<h3>Dried Lychees from Zengcheng</h3>
<p>— Chumei</p>
<p>Lychees are a famous product of Lingnan. The Guaglvk lychees of Zengcheng were formerly used as tributes during the autocratic era. Every year when the fruits ripened, the magistrate of Zengcheng presented them to the imperial family, and the common people rarely had the chance to taste this delicacy. The so-called "Guaglvk" means that there are green threads on the lychee kernels, which are like hanging paintings. This is what makes them different from ordinary lychees. No wonder Su Dongpo had the line "I would eat three hundred lychees a day, and I would not mind being a Lingnan native forever." The lychees that Su Dongpo ate were produced in Zengcheng, and his respect for them was so great.</p>
<p>Yang Guifei of the Tang Dynasty suffered from halitosis, and no medicine could cure it. The imperial physician said that Lingnan lychees could cure this disease. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang immediately issued an edict, and the postmaster sent them with a thousand-mile horse. After Guifei ate them, her breath was as fragrant as orchids, and since then, the tributes were continuous.</p>
<p>The author is from the south, and whenever lychees are in season, I must eat my fill every day. After coming to Shanghai, I have not been able to taste them, because fresh lychees transported to Shanghai have already had their skins broken and their flesh rotten, and eating them is enough to cause illness. There are dried lychees on the market, most of which are baked with fire, and the quality is dry and the taste has changed, and they are not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I had dinner with a friend at the Weilin Restaurant next to Jing'an Temple and saw fresh dried lychees on display. I bought some to try, and they were indeed excellent products. According to Mr. Lin, an employee of the company, these dried lychees are indeed products of Zengcheng, Guangdong. A relative of his is doing business in Zengcheng, and every time lychees are on the market, he must buy the best ones at high prices and dry them completely by sun-drying with the power of sunlight. The original taste and efficacy are preserved. In previous years, they were transported to South America, and there was more demand than supply. This year, because the debts were too large, they stopped transporting them to the United States. Mr. Lin heard the news and sent a letter to his relatives, urging them to transport them all to Shanghai to share with the people of Shanghai. I unexpectedly enjoyed a great feast and ordered some to share with my relatives and friends, and they all praised them as wonderful products.</p>
<h3>Mutton of Mao Town, Haimen</h3>
<p>— Hao Hao</p>
<p>Haimen mutton has always been famous in the world, and Mao Town mutton is said to have a unique flavor. After reading this article, readers can "feast their eyes" on it.</p>
<p>Haimen is a medium-sized county in Jiangbei, and although it is only separated from Shanghai, which is known as the Paris of the East, by a narrow strip of water, the customs are very simple and have not been infected with extravagance. Mao Town is a large town in Haimen with prosperous commerce. During the cotton season, the villagers who carry cotton to the town like to drink a cup of wine, so mutton restaurants have sprung up in response. Of all the mutton restaurants in the town, the most famous one used to be "Shi Liujiu." His mutton was cooked properly, without any fishy smell. The mutton was cooked in "red braised," "white meat," and "clear stew." Some were cooked with vermicelli, and some were steamed with glutinous rice. The most famous mutton, of course, was the "leg tube." After cooking, add some pepper powder, dip it in sweet sauce, and add some scallion crumbs. The taste is extremely wonderful.</p>
<p>The mutton restaurants in Mao Town are divided into two classes. One is for the middle and lower classes to eat, and the other is exclusively for young masters and gentlemen with eight-character mustaches. The price of leg tubes is more expensive, but it only costs two or three jiao to enjoy a feast. For those wealthy gourmets, this small amount does not seem to be a big deal.</p>
<p>Since the death of "Shi Liujiu," more than a dozen mutton restaurants have sprung up in Mao Town. The most famous one now is "Mutton Xishi." Xishi is a proprietress. She is in her prime and is very beautiful. At the same time, her cooking skills are indeed superior to others. With this uniquely flavored mutton, plus a "Wenjun Danglu" live sign, it is no wonder that the restaurant is packed with customers.</p>
<h3>Winter Nourishing Foods</h3>
<p>— Chengming</p>
<p>Time flies so fast, and the cold season of winter has arrived again. The busy masses, in the three months of winter, generally have to take some tonics to nourish their bodies. (Except for coolies and poor people.) People with money, of course, eat some ginseng, bird's nest, and tonic medicines to nourish their bodies and replenish their energy. Ordinary people, although they do not have the ability to take ginseng tonics, must also take some ordinary nourishing materials such as milk, soy milk, and eggs. In addition, there are several kinds of foods that are suitable for winter nourishment, and they are cheap and suitable for ordinary people. Here are the methods of making them:</p>
<p>Astragalus Braised Mutton Astragalus Braised Mutton can be used as an appetizer or a side dish. The author personally cooks it every winter. I have been doing this for six or seven years and it does have the effect of nourishing the body and lifting the spirits. It only costs two yuan in legal currency. This method was taught by the late painter Mr. Wu Taochan. The author followed the method and cooked it for the "winter" for many years. I did not take any other tonics, and my body is very strong and no diseases have occurred. Readers of the newspaper, you may wish to try it. [Method] Use a few taels of high-quality astragalus, one yuan (all Chinese medicine stores sell it), and one piece of fresh fat mutton leg, weighing three or four pounds, which costs one yuan. Boil the astragalus in a copper pot over a fire, add three or four bowls of clear water, for one or two hours, until the medicinal juice is concentrated, drain the soup juice, and then add clear water to boil. It must be boiled four times. Cook the medicinal juice and mutton together, then add ginger slices, red dates, Shaoxing wine, rock sugar, soy sauce, and a little fennel. It should be light and not salty. After it is cooked thoroughly, then take it out of the pot. You can eat it cold or hot every day. The taste is very delicious and you do not feel the medicinal taste.</p>
<p>Sea Cucumber and Mutton Mutton is slightly nourishing, which everyone knows. Therefore, mutton in winter is also one of the foods rich in nutrients. It is best to use spiny sea cucumber, soak it in clear water for three or four days, then wash it clean (the water sea cucumber on the vegetable stalls has too much water and is very soft and thin, so it has lost its function), and cook it with the cooked braised mutton. The taste is incomparably delicious.</p>
<p>Stewed Beef Use fresh and tender beef, five or six pounds, put it in a casserole, add ginger wine, soy sauce, clear salt and other things, and use a gentle charcoal stove to simmer it for seven or eight hours, then it will be very well-cooked. All the fat juice is in the soup. If you don't like to eat beef, just eat the soup, which is also very nourishing.</p>
<p>Tender Chicken Tender chicken must be a hen. It is best not to cut it with iron utensils. Use a bowl to cut its throat, wait until the blood is clear, put it in a casserole, and steam it in a rice pot for one or two hours. The taste is very delicious.</p>
<h3>Replacing the Nest: A Tale of Love and Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Terrible News Shocks Like a Flower Falling into Filth; Her Fragrant Shadow Frequently Visits, Her Heart is Like Willow Catkins Soaked in Mud</p>
<p>Guoqi was a bit stunned when he heard her words. Wasn't it you who had someone write me a letter, arranging to come today! But he didn't explain, and nodded to her in reply: "It's hot, I didn't go out. I just heard Miss Li came, so I've been waiting here." Youmei felt that his words today were much more active than usual, and he was even willing to stand and say so many polite words to a female guest. Standing in the room, she looked at the bookshelves around her and smiled, "I heard that Cousin has bought a lot more books." Guoqi laughed, "Speaking of books, it's quite funny, I don't even have enough of the books I need at hand. Please sit, please sit." Youmei smiled, "It's an honor for Cousin to let me sit in your room. It's not easy to entertain guests in the place where you read and write." Guoqi said, "You're too kind, too kind." As he spoke, he sat down on a small chair diagonally opposite her. Youmei sat on a white porcelain stool on the side of the bookshelf, slowly stroking her cheek with the index finger of her right hand, looking at the books on the bookshelf with a focused expression. Guoqi said, "Miss Li, what books do you want?" Youmei said, "Why is Qing so polite? You can just call me Cousin, or call me Youmei." Guoqi laughed, "Miss Li is so forthright, she speaks so frankly." After saying this, he felt at a loss for words, so he had to get up and pour a cup of tea himself, and handed it to her. Youmei got up, took the tea, thanked him, sat down and slowly sipped it, first smiling at Guoqi, and then becoming serious, she said, "Cousin, was there anything in the letter that Tian sent to you?" Guoqi also became serious and replied, "There was a gold ring." Originally, now we are a republic, men and women are equal, and social interaction is open, so there is no need to hide this matter. But everyone's family situation is different, so I can't talk nonsense. My relationship with that Miss Jiang is only through letters about poetry. I consider her a very loyal reader of my work. However, for someone who publishes articles, being able to have a loyal reader is no different from what the ancients called a 'soulmate of high mountains and flowing waters.' So, my feelings for Miss Jiang are only about gratitude for a kindred spirit." Youmei only sipped her tea slowly as he spoke. Even after she had finished the whole cup of tea, she still held the cup in her hand, pretending to want to drink. Finally, she said, "Menglan mentioned this to me too. Not only does she read the most Chinese books, but she also reads English books very fluently. How could she not be enamored with freedom? It's just that her background is different from ours, and she's been wearing shackles since she was a child." When Guoqi heard this, he was startled, and immediately straightened up and looked at Youmei. (107)</p>
<h3>Jinhua Ham</h3>
<p>— By Jian Chen</p>
<p>In our country, it is customary to give gifts to show respect during festivals and when relatives and friends visit. Among many gifts, Jinhua ham is considered the best. This custom flourished in the early Qing Dynasty. According to the "Zhou Chu Local Customs Records," there is the following record: "The custom of giving gifts has been around for a long time, but it was most prevalent in the early Qing Dynasty. As for gifts, Jinhua ham from Zhejiang was the best. Princes and nobles all loved it dearly. Therefore, when Manchus in the early Qing Dynasty met distinguished guests or held banquets, they would first brew famous tea and slice ham to show respect." It can be seen that Jinhua ham was very popular at that time.</p>
<p>As for the ham-producing areas in our country, the most famous are Jinhua and Yunnan. Yunnan Province is located in the southwest, and transportation is difficult, so not much of its produce is transported and sold to various places. Jinhua is different because of its convenient transportation and excellent products, so its products are popular throughout the country and it dominates the ham industry. Jinhua is located in central Zhejiang, slightly southwest. The Qiantang River flows through the area from Lanxi, making water transportation very convenient. In recent years, highways have been built, and land transportation is not as difficult as it used to be. Jinhua used to be under the jurisdiction of eight counties, and six of them (Jinhua, Dongyang, Yiwu, Pujiang, Yongkang, and Lanxi) all produce ham. The total annual output is thirteen thousand pieces (each weighing two hundred and ten catties), with Dongyang having the largest output, seven thousand pieces per year, followed by Yongkang, Yiwu, and other counties.</p>
<p>There are many names for ham, such as Southern Ham, Northern Ham, and Tea Ham, among which Tea Ham is considered the best. This product is produced in Shangjiang Village, Dongyang (Tea Ham is not produced in Jinhua, but it has always been called Jinhua Tea Ham because Dongyang was a subordinate county of Jinhua during the Qing Dynasty.) Hu Xueyan, a prominent Zhejiang merchant in the early Qing Dynasty, loved to eat it. Later, Zhejiang officials competed to purchase this product as a means of currying favor, calling it Tea Ham. As a result, various shops also prominently advertised it. Today, the name Tea Ham is known at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The output of Tea Ham is not large, only over three hundred pieces per year, and the price is twenty to thirty yuan more expensive per piece than Southern Ham. Ham merchants, in addition to purchasing first, second, and third-class goods, also purchase a few pieces of Tea Ham for knowledgeable buyers. Hu Hengchang in Hangzhou has a larger sales volume, so it purchases more, but the daily sales are mainly second and third-class goods, which are cheaper and not of inferior quality, just slightly less fresh. The method of making ham is very simple, that is, first select high-quality pig legs, wash them, and then salt them. After storing them for half a month, they are very salty when taken out of the jar. They should be desalted slightly before being exposed to the sun, hence the name "Fire Ham" (火腿). As for the method of making Tea Ham, that is, when putting the pig legs into the jar for salting, soak them in strong tea juice. After half a month, they can be taken out and dried in the hot sun. Then the meat will be rosy and lovely, and the taste will be fresh and delicious. The first business to specialize in Tea Ham was called Xuefang. Today, countless businesses use this name, like Lugaojian in Shanghai and Yebiji in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Although making ham is easy, it is difficult to preserve its taste for a long time! Because ham has been salted, it can last longer than other bland foods, but it is very susceptible to moisture. If it is slightly affected, the taste will change. Therefore, during the plum rain season, the ham should be exposed in a windy, rain-free place. If the weather is clear, it is best to dry it in the sun so that it will not be damaged by moisture.</p>
<p>Therefore, to ensure the good taste of ham, in addition to selecting good pig breeds and feeding them properly, it is also necessary to pay attention to proper preservation so that its taste can remain unchanged for a long time. In recent years, the ham industry has been affected by the domestic economic downturn, so business has greatly declined. Taking Hangzhou as an example, twenty years ago, seven or eight thousand pieces could be sold annually, but in recent years, only three or four thousand pieces have been sold, only half of what it used to be. If there are major domestic disasters, the number may be even less!</p>

<h3>Grain: Multiple Parties Try to Absorb Supply; Speculation Drives Flour Prices Up Sharply</h3>
<p>— Prices Rise by a Dime Limit in All Months —</p>
<p>Yesterday morning after the opening bell, flour prices rose sharply for all months. Although the price of foreign wheat only fell slightly by about a dime, and there was no special demand for domestic sales, speculation continued to flourish without limit. The short positions in the exchange were not factory hedging, and outside investors had already retreated, so the bulls put all their efforts into buying, creating an unprecedented surge. The market was forced to halt after rising by a dime. At the opening around 10 AM, near-term contracts rose by two or three cents, and distant-term contracts rose by four or five cents. Later, due to strong buying interest, prices rose step by step by another three or four cents. At the afternoon opening, bulls immediately raised prices, and all months had reached the dime limit. Although factories sold 60,000 to 70,000 bags, it was like a drop in the bucket and could not stop the buying frenzy. If the authorities do not take effective corrective measures, the future of the people's food supply will be greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Wheat Itself Has No Problem; Market Increase Is Influenced by Speculative Flour; Hope to Reduce Import Tax on Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning after the opening bell, wheat prices were initially flat and then improved. The price of foreign wheat was slightly lower, so sentiment was calm at the start. However, flour prices were manipulated by large outside investors, and the market not only did not ease but became even more heated. Therefore, after the opening, all months followed suit, rising by three, six, or seven cents. At the afternoon opening, the situation in the flour market was very serious, and short covering was strong. February and March contracts rose another three, five, or six cents. According to industry insiders, if the import tax on foreign wheat can be reduced, the fixed price is close to the sentiment of the people and will not be breached again. The current wheat market has little stock and is very high, so the market has not seen any formal delivery.</p>
<h3>Fewer Rice Boats Arrive in Shanghai Each Day; Rice Prices in North Shanghai Rise More Sharply</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of ninety ships arrived from various provinces, carrying a total of 18,400-18,500 shih of rice. Thin Dao rice still accounted for more than sixty ships. The market continued to show some vitality. However, due to the cloudy and rainy weather, which seemed to indicate snow, sentiment was firm. Sales in the local market were quite brisk, and buyers were also refreshed. About 7,000-8,000 bags of thin Dao rice and over 4,000 bags of thick Geng rice were shipped in from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other provinces in the north. As a result, rice shops quietly raised the price of thin Dao rice by two or three jiao, thick Geng rice by one jiao and seven fen, and Du Yang Jian rice by one jiao. Yin Yuan rice was also priced higher.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, no rice boats arrived at the gates in the western section of the Suzhou River and the southern Huangpu River. Rice merchants had no rice to sell, the market was in chaos, sentiment was panicked, and rice prices soared by two or three jiao. If the detention of rice boats at Jiwang Temple is not remedied and released soon, the food supply for the entire Shanghai will be greatly affected. Yesterday, the price of Bai Geng rice soared by two or three jiao, the price of thin Dao rice rose by about three jiao, the price of Yangbu Du Ke Jian rice rose by two jiao, and the price of Yin Bian Yuan rice rose by one or two jiao. The price of other types of rice also rose by one, two, or three jiao.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants Wait and See; Early Indica Rice Market Remains Flat; Hunan Rice Can Be Shipped Directly; Impact of Tax Reduction on Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>The market for early Indica rice has been flat for a long time. Although the prices of flour, wheat, and other grains have been rising steadily, rice prices have not been able to recover because Hunan rice is directly shipped to Guangdong Province, and the tax on foreign rice in Guangdong Province has been reduced. Therefore, Guangdong merchants have been waiting and seeing for a long time, and there has been no continued replenishment of large quantities. Although Anhui Province and other provinces have taken measures to ban shipments, market prices have not been able to rise. Yesterday, sales from Shantou and Henan provinces were brisk, and local hoarders were also active. Guangdong and northern merchants made some purchases, and market prices began to recover slightly, rising by a dime or two, depending on the variety. Yesterday, 10,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,480 bags of Hunan rice, and 4,275 bags of Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Jiangbei rice were sold.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Has Hedging Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean cake market was sluggish due to low sales. However, because standard soybean cake prices were rising sharply, and there was a profit to be made from hedging, there were hedging transactions, and prices increased. Yesterday, Sipai cake was priced at $1.90, with the January delivery contract priced at $1.93, and 3,000 pieces were traded. There were also 3,000 pieces of current cake traded.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: After Consecutive Sharp Increases, Speculators Take Profits; Sellers Surge in the Morning, Prices Fall Step by Step; Bulls Add to Positions in the Afternoon, Market Rebounds; But Overall, All Months Still Fall by More Than Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rebounded, but ultimately still fell. This was because consecutive sharp increases had prompted a large number of profit-takers to liquidate their positions. In addition, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market was lackluster, and marked yarn was more than twenty yuan higher, so some traders tended to sell. However, one merchant did not sell, and continued to add to their positions whenever the price fell. In addition, yarn stocks were unusually low, so near-term market conditions remained firm. However, current yarn sales were slightly weaker. Observing the current situation, it would not be surprising if marked yarn fell by ten yuan from its peak.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Prices Increase for Both Near-Term and Distant-Term Contracts</p>
<p>The market for marked yarn opened lower across all months in the morning, and the momentum was weak. This was because the previous day's surge was too excessive, prompting profit-takers to close their positions. The exchange also increased the special margin to avoid danger and restricted new trading activity. In addition, as the end of the year approached, most traders closed out their positions, and the market was sluggish. Sellers came in droves, and the decline was rapid, falling step by step. As a result, all months fell by 3.6 to 4.7 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, near-term contracts continued to decline, while distant-term Changfeng bulls continued to add to their positions, and the market rebounded. Near-term contracts rose sharply in the second session, while distant-term contracts were flat. The third session was slightly weaker, and prices rose again until the close. However, current yarn trading became quiet. As a result, all months rose by 1.5 to 2.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Jinchang sold 5,400 bales, Dafeng 1,800 bales, Hengyi 1,700 bales, Mingde 1,750 bales, Hexing 4,200 bales, Yuan Yi 1,400 bales, Dachangcheng 1,050 bales, Hengchang 1,600 bales, Dachang 3,500 bales, and Renfeng 2,100 bales. Dafu bought 1,650 bales, Taixing 2,550 bales, Senkang 2,500 bales, Changfeng 5,000 bales, Runkang 3,250 bales, Yuda 3,800 bales, Yicheng 1,500 bales, Gengfeng 900 bales, Meiji 700 bales, Deda 700 bales, and Jifeng 1,000 bales. A comparison of intraday market conditions is as follows:</p>
<p>Current Yarn Rail Transport Slightly Quiet</p>
<p>It was found that Quan Rong and other merchants bought a total of 625 bales. The selling price fell by more than two yuan. The purchase amount of each merchant is as follows:</p>
<h3>Near-Term Cotton Sales Show Some Squeeze</h3>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, showing a good trend. This was because some cotton merchants believed that the yarn market was rising, and most retail investors were buying yarn and hedging cotton, resulting in a slight squeeze in near-term sales. However, there was still no solution for the coarse velvet cotton that had been continuously hedged last month. The overseas Indian and American cotton markets continued to decline, and Shanghai cotton stocks were sufficient.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Prices Increase by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>The market for marked cotton opened lower in the morning because the overseas Indian and American cotton markets were declining across the board, and it was rumored that Japanese merchants had purchased 2,000 bales of Indian cotton the previous day. As a result, sentiment was sluggish. At the same time, the yarn market fell, and the market situation was even worse. All months fell by 2.3 cents. Later, news of the opening of a Qingdao yarn factory slightly improved the situation. As a result, all months fell by 1.5 to 3 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening price, the market situation tightened, and the upward trend was also strong. Because the flour market was soaring, many parties were active. However, Indian cotton prices were flat and weak, and arrivals were abundant. As a result, all months rebounded by 5.5 to 6.5 cents compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yichang sold 7,500 dan, Xinchang 4,600 dan, Dachang 1,900 dan, Dafu 1,900 dan, Juxing 3,900 dan, Fengtai and 3,200 dan, Yicheng 4,000 dan, Xinhua 3,400 dan, Yikang 3,400 dan, Xincheng 5,800 dan, Jinchang 2,200 dan, Taichang 5,900 dan, and Weifeng 5,300 dan. Tonghe bought 13,900 dan, Yuanxingchang 8,300 dan, Dachangcheng 17,600 dan, Shengyuan 6,400 dan, Weihe 5,200 dan, Daji 1,400 dan, Yuan Yi 3,400 dan, Hengyi 2,400 dan, and Meiji 3,700 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Current Cotton Trading Becomes Sparse</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is sluggish, and factory demand is quiet. Because Indian cotton prices are approaching parity, the source is Yao cotton 685 bales, general cotton 1,360 bales, Tongzhou cotton 49.00, Shenxin Factory purchased 1,200 bales of spot goods delivered to the factory. Zhengzhou cotton 51.50, and also 100 pieces. Also, Lingxian cotton 66.00, Tongxing Factory purchased 165 pieces, and also, and also.</p>
<h3>Yarn Exchange Further Increases Special Margin; Collects a Total of Forty-Two Yuan for December Contracts; Collects a Total of Thirty-Two Yuan for All Other Months</h3>
<p>Because the yarn market has been rising recently, the highest peak for the December contract reached 268 yuan on the previous day. In view of the serious situation, the exchange decided to increase the special margin for cotton yarn again (starting from December 7th) to maintain stability. The special margin for cotton remained unchanged. It was found that new buyers of December cotton yarn are required to pay a special margin of 32 yuan per bale, plus the original margin of 10 yuan, for a total of 42 yuan. For all other months, a special margin of 24 yuan per bale is required, plus the original margin of 10 yuan, for a total of 32 yuan. The large increase in the margin is a new record since the establishment of the exchange.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn Factories Are Buying Indian Cotton Very Actively</h3>
<p>Although American cotton was firm last week, it failed to rise here due to the increase in new cotton movements. Export demand has recently expanded. In the Far East, due to the rise in Sanpin yarn, purchases have been very active. Lancashire is paying attention to Karachi cotton, and local yarn factories are relatively active and have hopes of resuming operations. The statistics for last week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>The prices of Mumbai yarn and cloth have increased as follows compared to last week: Shirt cloth 13 rupees 12 annas, up 4 annas; Bedding cloth 4 rupees, flat; 20-count yarn 7.75 annas, up 0.25 annas; 10-count yarn 6 annas, up 0.25 annas.</p>
<h3>Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Prices Show Mixed Results</h3>
<p>On the 7th, a telegram from Osaka reported that Sanpin futures yarn fell by 6 jiao to rise by 1.5 yuan, with the near-term contract at 243 yuan and the distant-term contract at 218.9 jiao. Futures cotton fell by 1.5 to 3 cents, with the near-term contract at 67.2 yuan and the distant-term contract at 68.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: High Prices of Cotton Cloth Seen Repeatedly; Shortage of Supplies from Various Sources; Sales to North and South Increase; Prices of Bleached Cloth and Flannel Surge; Factories Sell Out All Spot Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued to be good, and selling prices remained high, unaffected by the decline in marked yarn prices. Demand from Sichuan and North China provinces increased significantly, and demand from other provinces was also good. However, the supply of cloth has been reduced due to the strike, the shortage of raw yarn, and the recent detention of rice boats, which has blocked waterways and hindered the arrival of goods from other ports. Due to these various reasons, the source of goods has been sharply reduced, so they are becoming more and more popular and new high prices are repeatedly appearing. Fine cloth and fine twill rose by 5 to 10 cents per bolt, coarse cloth and coarse twill rose by 10 to 30 cents per bolt, straight tribute, serge, and woolen cloth rose by about 10 cents per bolt, while bleached cloth and flannel were surging, rising by up to 50-60 cents per bolt. In the past two days, all spot goods and goods arriving from other ports from various factories have been purchased by various merchants. There are still many who have pre-purchased goods for this month. Tianjin merchants purchased more than 500 pieces of white flannel, serge, and woolen cloth, and Sichuan merchants purchased more than 400 pieces of straight tribute, woolen cloth, blue cloth, colored twill, and fine cloth. Chunling goods from Guangzhong, Hongzhang, Huayang, Liming, and other factories, and plain silk are being sold successively for this month and January, totaling one thousand several hundred boxes, mostly plain silk in plain colors, purchased by merchants from Sichuan and Hunan.</p>
<h3>Overcoat Fabrics Sell Well</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics have been selling very well recently. As it is cold in winter, woolen fabrics are all in season. Heavy overcoat fabrics are widely sold by tailors. Sales of plain, thick fabrics, riding breeches, thick serge, and thick overcoat fabrics are particularly strong. Long-haired camel wool, 30-count colored riding breeches, navy blue melton, plain, thick fabrics, Jinshan and silk-glossed feather yarn, horsehair lining, and horse bristle sleeves have all been particularly popular recently. Goods are in short supply and prices are rising. Tailors have been actively replenishing their stocks, resulting in supply falling short of demand.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange: British and American Currencies Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, the British and American currencies were tight while the Japanese Yen eased. Banks were willing to absorb them. According to morning reports from overseas, the London long-term and short-term rates both rose by 1.25. The New York silver market was closed due to a strike. The forward silver price in Monterrey rose by 4.0% to 6.5%. The price of raw gold in London rose by 3 pence.

The US dollar weakened against the British pound by 0.21875, and weakened against the French Franc by 0.1875. The Central Bank's official rates were announced: both British and American currencies remained level. The customs gold unit rose by 4%. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of the British pound at 1 shilling, 2 and 53125/625 pence. The US dollar was at 29.6875 yuan, which was a slight increase compared to the previous closing. The British pound was level, while the US dollar tightened by 0.03125. After the opening, Chinese merchants sold off Eastern currencies, while Japanese banks strongly supported the market. Banks released near-term US dollars, while the Sin Fung Foreign Firm bought them. The HSBC bank's official rates were announced: both British and American currencies remained level, and there was still demand in the market. The White Silver Equalization Tax was announced, rising by 0.5%. Banks made slight supplemental purchases, while Japanese banks continued to absorb. The trend began to shift from loose to level, and banks also engaged in reciprocal transactions. The market hovered around midday. Although there were telegraphic sales from Hong Kong in the afternoon, banks generally maintained their positions and there were no major changes. The initial decision on Indian silver was to remain unchanged, but the second decision reported a small increase of 3 annas. The final decision was revised.

<h3>Securities and Public Bond Market Atmosphere Unusually Ordinary</h3>
<p>The difference between high and low is between one and two jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for the public bonds on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange became even more sluggish. The market fluctuations were also extremely ordinary. The current situation is chaotic, and the people's spirits are increasingly scattered. Large investors are extremely lacking in participation. Even the transactions of retail investors have decreased. The comparison between the high and low prices of the entire day's market did not exceed one or two jiao. The volume of transactions was also sparse. Such a quiet phenomenon is rare. The market price fluctuations are becoming increasingly sluggish. In a state of fluctuation, it is still not easy to develop a trend. The market trend yesterday only saw more selling from retail investors when the market opened in the morning, and the selling of No. 77 and No. 35 was slightly more enthusiastic. The market price fell by one, two, or three jiao across the board. The remaining three trading sessions were extremely stable. Each household only supplied three or five million in capital for supply and demand, which could manipulate the rise and fall of the market situation. The market price also only had a difference of jiao. Major buyers absorbed No. 5, No. 50, and No. 72 in comparison. No. 14 and No. 35 had selling, but the amount was also limited. The result of the whole day was a slight decrease of five cents to two jiao across the board. The total number of transactions was 3.87 million yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall of the highs and lows is listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>
<h3>Oil Market: After the Release of New Asphalt, the Rise of Macheng Heavy Jing Oil is Still Difficult to Ease. Although Lanyang Oil is Cheap, its Moisture Content is High. Hwobon Oil is Highly Priced, Only for Emergencies.</h3>
<p>Since the old asphalt was searched and collected everywhere by foreign firms, it has been sold out everywhere. Although the new oil has also entered the market, it has not yet become prosperous. As a result, there has been a gap between the new and old oils, and production has been interrupted for more than half a month. Although the production volume is gradually increasing, the demand for candles has also begun. Therefore, the supply in the markets of Hankou and Shanghai is still far from meeting demand. In the Hankou market, only 70 to 100 pieces of Macheng oil arrive every day. In terms of sales, even if 2,000 to 3,000 pieces arrived, it would not be enough to distribute. The gap between arrival and sales is so huge. It is unknown when there will be a hope for relaxation. Five years ago, when the price of heavy Jing oil rose to more than 40 yuan, there was no such phenomenon in the market. Although there was a lack of continuity between the new and old oils, there was always a constant supply, but the time interval was never as long as this time. Recently, the Macheng oil arriving in the Hankou market has been supplied and packaged by various gangs as it arrives. In the future, when the market opens, it is feared that it will not be possible to sell it for less than 20 yuan per dan. The price of heavy Jing oil has opened at 21.8 yuan per piece, which, when combined with the arrival in the Shanghai market, is already at 24.5 or 6 yuan. The trend is imminent. It is already a great favor to be able to distribute dozens of pieces. Therefore, local merchants in Shanghai have discussed selling it for 25.5 yuan. The minimum price must also be 25 yuan. Macheng oil must also be at 23.5 or 6 yuan. However, due to the lack of supply, it is generally a rare and odd phenomenon. It is only heard that Jinlan and other places in eastern Zhejiang can produce more than 200 pieces every day. The oil previously sold off has been settled and shipped completely. There is now a slight surplus of existing oil, and the market is gradually trending towards peace. One piece has slightly eased to 23 yuan for Lanyang delivery. However, because the new oil inevitably contains moisture, it still seems to be more expensive when combined with Jing oil. Although the demand for goods in Shanghai is strong, it is still waiting and watching. The price of Hwobon oil in western Zhejiang is the highest, requiring more than 25 yuan per dan. Even if there are a few transactions, it is only for emergencies, and it is not enough to be considered a standard market. Moreover, the local annual yield is extremely poor. The cost of new oil must be 26 or 7 yuan. Therefore, what is currently sold is only old oil. It is also heard that the number of old oil reserves is greater than the amount of new oil produced this year. Because the production of new oil is only one-tenth of the previous year, the local area is hoarding and speculating.</p>
<h3>Refined Tung Oil for Export: Refining is Fast at Eight Jiao. The Spot Oil Price in Hankou Rises Again.</h3>
<p>The white tung oil route for foreign firms in the Hankou market has always been uninterrupted throughout the year. The quantity varies, and there is no fixed time. Since the new oil was released this year, only a small amount of spot oil has been handled in the autumn season. There are not many futures for November. The quantity is slightly larger in December, January, and February. Therefore, exports in October were very sparse. It is estimated that it will not exceed 2,000 tons last month. It is likely that the market will begin to prosper this month. However, because there was no autumn rain this year, and the winter was sunny, the water volume of the Yangtze River was extremely shallow in the upper reaches, which has been unprecedented in decades. The oil from various producing areas in Sichuan and western Hubei could not be shipped out. Only a small amount could be loaded from the Changde area of Hunan Province due to the shallow water, and it was very delayed. Therefore, the source of supply in the Hankou market was unusually sparse. During this severe winter, according to past examples, it is the time of peak production, and the market should be in a state of easing and decline. However, the arrival of goods is so meager that it is impossible to fall. Fortunately, the spot oil taken by each foreign firm is only a small amount of dozens of tons, so the price has not risen sharply. Otherwise, it is unknown how the market would change. However, the time for settlement of the previously sold futures is approaching. Sellers may have already supplemented their positions to offset the delivery. If the incoming goods are delayed, the spot oil will inevitably be squeezed temporarily. Currently, the futures handled by various foreign firms are mostly for February and March. The price is 48.5 yuan to 48.2 yuan per dan, including gross profit and foreign regulations, and transactions are taking place one after another. The quantity is also not small. However, according to a telegram received in Shanghai from Hankou yesterday, the spot oil has been increased to 50 yuan. This shows the shortage of spot oil. Since the establishment of the Plant Oil Factory of the Ministry of Industry in Shanghai, all exported oil must be refined by the factory. Work has now begun. The oil merchants in Shanghai who are engaged in export trade have also negotiated with the factory. Therefore, the oil that has arrived recently has been sent to the factory for storage. According to reports, the shipment is very fast. The refining fee is calculated at 8 jiao in national currency, which is more than double the amount required for self-refining in the past. Oil merchants have no choice. The foundation for the control of oil inspection and foreign trade has been established. Observing the situation, there will be more advanced measures in the near future.</p>
<h3>Dalian Steps Up: Soybean Oil Rises Another Three Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market situation continued to follow the surge in Dalian. The market tightened again by three jiao yesterday. Although the momentum has not reached a sharp point, the overall rising trend is quite considerable. The entire city opened for trading of various oils for more than 750 pieces. The supply of peanut oil has been received, the price has eased, and more than 3,400 pieces have been transacted. The market is stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Indian Firms are Selling Silk Especially Well. Chekiang Silk's Supply is Not Enough to Meet Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market continued to see a small decline. Spot goods fell by 10 yuan, and futures fell by 19 yuan. There was no market in the United States. The sales of white filature and French silk remained sluggish and there was little development in recent days. Indian firms are selling silk especially well. The volume of transactions yesterday was relatively large and the market price was very firm. The stock in Shanghai, such as Chekiang silk, is not enough to meet the market demand. Various inland areas are rushing to pack and transport to Shanghai. The Golden Bird grade is currently selling for 615 yuan, which is another 5 yuan higher than last weekend. Other silk products have also risen quite sharply. User silk was sold yesterday for 45 bales. The market price was sluggish, with only 2 or 3 yuan fluctuations, so transactions were also small.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: The Price of Xu Kui Melon Seeds from the Production Area is High</h3>
<p>—There is a Xi'an Gang Advising—</p>
<p>Recently, the arrival and storage of black melon seeds have been limited. Therefore, although the season for removing stomachs is not yet prosperous, the market price has risen instead. The price for the first-grade seeds opened at 21.8 yuan, and the price for Xu Kui seeds was 21.2 yuan. At the same time, the origin of production is even tighter. According to customer news, the stock in Xu County is extremely thin. Recently, there have been groups from Xi'an actively purchasing. The first-grade seeds require 24.5 yuan for application, and Xu Kui seeds also require 23 yuan. Compared with the Shanghai market, there is a difference of 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Urgent Need for Protecting the Soldiers at the Suiyuan Front Line (Part 1)</h3>
<p>——Dr. Pang Jingzhou's Lecture——　Recorded by Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>Reporter's Foreword</p>
<p>Mr. Pang Jingzhou has just returned from studying in the New World. He came back at a time when the smoke of war was rising in Suiyuan like a beacon. As everyone cared about the survival of the nation at the front line, Mr. Pang flew to the front line with enthusiastic patriotic social leaders from Shanghai to conduct on-site observations and to comfort the soldiers at the forefront on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai. The news was published in the newspapers and everyone knew it in great detail.</p>
<p>However, from a medical perspective, what we urgently need to understand is the situation of the rescue at the front and what kind of needs there are. The importance of this issue is not only a concern for people in the medical and pharmaceutical circles across the country, but also an urgent hope for all Chinese people. In order to understand this issue urgently, the reporter invited Mr. Pang to publicly explain it in the public medical and pharmaceutical lecture of the Sino-Western Radio Station on December 1, the day before Mr. Pang went to Beiping. Mr. Pang agreed to our request and gave a very brief speech from his busy schedule. The audience must have been very clear. In order to inform people across the country for research purposes, we have recorded the points about rescue in Mr. Pang's speech and published them in this magazine so that people in the medical and pharmaceutical circles can have a comprehensive plan and preparation at this time to meet the urgent needs of the front line.</p>
<p>1. General Concepts from Suiyuan</p>
<p>The country is in imminent danger, and only resistance can lead to survival. This has become the central belief of almost everyone in every important position on the national defense front line. Every soldier fighting is a man who deeply understands righteousness. The expression of the spirit of loyalty and courage is really unrestrained, which makes people feel unspeakable excitement and optimism.</p>
<p>The biggest purpose of this trip, on the one hand, was to comfort; on the other hand, I was entrusted by the Red Cross and went with Mr. Yan Fuqing to survey the local situation and plan rescue work. We have this additional mission, so our eyes on Suiyuan also concern the design of the Suiyuan rescue work.</p>
<p>The rescue agencies there are really too poor. Apart from a relatively complete Belgian hospital, the rest are few and far between. Although Mr. Yan Baichuan of Shanxi ordered the local Chuanzhi Hospital authorities to plan the rescue of the Suiyuan war, there are many places that need our assistance and supplementation from the rear.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, Northerners have Northern strength, especially in Suiyuan. Some places are really boundless deserts, with no people in sight for miles. It is unknown how many miles you have to walk to reach a village. Under these circumstances, it is also difficult for the location of the rescue team to have a close response with the soldiers at the front line. Fortunately, the brave men of the North have a spirit of perseverance and courage. If they have minor injuries, they never want to take a break. They tear up their clothes, wrap up their wounds themselves, and they still want to fight desperately forward! We know that medicine tells us that no matter what kind of wound, it is necessary to strictly disinfect and wrap it with appropriate symptoms to be safer. However, the wounds that the brave men at the front encounter do not have disinfecting medicines to apply, nor do they have disinfecting gauze or bandages... for them to wrap up; the tools they use to cover their wounds are only the belts on their bodies. On the belts that are covered with flying sand and splashed with dirt, letting them wrap the wounds, how dangerous is this? Not to mention anything else, just talking about tetanus bacteria, which live in the soil, in case the mud splashes on the belts, and the belts happen to have tetanus bacteria, this minor injury will turn into a life-threatening serious illness, which is self-evident!</p>
<p>Therefore, from this aspect, we have a clear concept: we believe that the loyalty and courage of the soldiers at the front are extraordinary; the danger of the soldiers at the front is also extraordinary! They are not only constantly guarding against the enemy's harm; at the same time, if they are lucky enough to survive small injuries, they do not know how serious the hidden crisis is. How can we not try to protect their precious lives?</p>
<p>2. The Simplest First Aid Method Most Needed at the Front Line</p>
<p>We understand the environment of the front line, and understand the spirit and pain of the soldiers at the front. How should we try to rescue them? When I was on the return trip, I discussed with Mr. Yan Fuqing and others, and everyone thought that the only way was to supply a kind of first-aid kit. In the current process of the Suiyuan War, a complete rescue organization and rescue talent are of course very needed: but in fact, it cannot be done completely. The brave men of the North, that kind of extraordinary and strong personality, never take minor injuries to heart, so it is necessary to design a simple emergency medicine kit, and give each person one to carry with them, which is more reasonable and safer than using clothes to wrap wounds.</p>
<p>Immediately, we took this plan back to Shanghai and discussed it with the Shanghai Rescue Public Group. We are very grateful for everyone's sympathy, and people in the pharmaceutical industry are willing to undertake the production of 100,000 sets, which is really a happy thing. As for the things prepared in the rescue medicine kit, they are as follows.</p>
<p>A small bottle of dilute tincture of iodine, a piece of sea iodine gauze, a piece of mercuric chloride gauze, a roll of bandage, a small roll of band-aid, a piece of triangular bandage, two safety pins, and two painkillers.</p>
<p>The medicines and supplies in this first-aid kit are probably these. However, our original plan was to put these supplies in a paper bag with instructions printed on the outside, but we were afraid that it would be inconvenient to carry or easily broken, so we decided to use a cigarette tin, store the medicines inside, tie a rope on the outside, and paste the instructions on it, so that the soldiers can hang it on their belts and apply it easily, and it can also maintain the disinfection inside the can.</p>
<p>When I say this, I remember another sentence, everything needs to "adapt to the times", and it is probably not wrong to do so. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Construction of Tomorrow's Nursing Profession in China (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Li Lingdong</p>
<p>Therefore, we should regard the problem of internship for nursing students as one where various courses are taken during the first two years of training, and then during the final year or half year, students return to the wards for full-time internship. This will allow nursing students to have a good effect on their service spirit and physical health, and will suit the purpose of educating talents. However, the daily courses should be based on the standard of equal emphasis on "theory" and "practice." Simply talking on paper in books is equivalent to the situation of "empty valleys transmitting sounds." Practice classrooms should be established for practice. If there is too much emphasis on practice without understanding theory, it will also create a deformed "apprenticeship." I hope that the nursing community will not ignore the problem of internship for nursing students again!</p>
<p>The subject of Chinese language should focus on applied writing so that it can be suitable for practical application when serving society. Therefore, a nurse is often confused about correspondence, condolences, petitions, announcements, reports, etc. in society and does not know where to start writing. This is entirely due to the lack of sufficient practice at school. In the future, the subject of Chinese language must not focus solely on studying the works of ancient masters.</p>
<p>We believe that it is necessary to add the subject of physics and chemistry because nurses' work is closely related to physics and chemistry. What we encounter in daily life is all within the circle of scientific medicine. If we have no knowledge base of physics and chemistry, how can we understand the principles of medical treatment and diagnosis? Physics and chemistry are the mother of medical science and the foundation of nursing science. Because we cannot deny that physics and chemistry are the mother of medical science, we cannot oppose that it is the foundation of nursing science. Physics and chemistry should be a compulsory and major subject in the nursing curriculum.</p>
<p>Fifth, concentrated training for nurses is the driving force for transforming old lives into new lives.</p>
<p>We should plan for the reform and improvement of nursing education for tomorrow and forget that there are already more than 9,000 nurses who have graduated. Without training, there will be great resistance to reforming nursing education for tomorrow because these more than 9,000 nurses have not been baptized by the new education. Their thinking is stubborn, and their work skills are stagnant. At the same time, they always occupy a leading position in nursing schools, hospitals, and society. They have not been able to understand the new educational trends, and the system for managing students is still the apprentice method. If you think that the leadership is in such a situation, the promotion of nursing education for tomorrow cannot be discussed on the same day.</p>
<p>If we train these more than 9,000 nurses in new nursing education and transform their old lives into new lives, we can turn the "resistance" to the advancement of nursing education into a "driving force" for promoting nursing education. From this, we can see that training past nurses is an urgent matter.</p>
<p>How do we train them? The principle is that it does not hinder the work of the original service unit and that the training can be popularized in a short period of time. The training time for each course is six months. The country is divided into 30 locations, and each location recruits 50 people. In just three years, more than 9,000 nurses can be trained in new nursing education. At the same time, if there are three nurses in a hospital, only one needs to be trained for half a year, which will not hinder the work they are responsible for.</p>
<p>Sixth, "training" and "education" should be implemented together to seek the source of the development of the nursing career.</p>
<p>The combination of "training" and "education" has had a huge shock in modern educational thought. In the past, we only knew how to develop in academic knowledge, and we did not pay much attention to the guidance of character. As a result, students became frivolous, vain, extravagant, and dissipated, their spirits were scattered, and the more knowledge they gained, the more they helped them do bad things, harming society and becoming a scourge to mankind. Therefore, the education community today believes that the importance of "training and education" is no less than "education." Therefore, the facilities of "training and education" are being promoted by the national education community with all its strength.</p>
<p>The implementation of "training" and "education" in nursing education is more urgent than in other professions. Students in nursing schools are different from other schools. They have to work in the ward step by step. The ward is a microcosm of a part of society and is very close to society. Because of personal lack of knowledge and poor character, it can affect the reputation of the entire hospital and affect the future of the entire school. Therefore, how can we ignore the simultaneous implementation of "training" and "education" in nursing education today? Conclusion</p>
<p>To sum up, if these opinions on building China's nursing career can be implemented, China's nursing career will definitely prosper after only three years. The nursing profession originated with Miss Nightingale, but the establishment of nursing as a school-based career is also due to the efforts of the Chinese nursing community, which has set an example for the world's nursing career and won a place of glory for the country. May my Chinese medical and pharmaceutical community and nursing community comrades strive for it.</p>
<h3>Spitting into a Handkerchief</h3>
<p>— Song Ke San</p>
<p>As long as you observe carefully, you can see at any time and anywhere that Chinese people blindly follow the movements of foreigners. High-heeled leather shoes, corsets, knee-length skirts, and other unhygienic habits, which one of them was not learned from foreigners? However, these habits only hinder one's own health and have nothing to do with others. The most harmful to public health is spitting into a handkerchief!</p>
<p>Spitting all over the ground is a bad habit of Chinese people. When Zeng Jize and Li Hongzhang were envoys to foreign countries, they were despised by foreigners for spitting anywhere on the ship, leaving an indelible stain on the international community. Since then, Chinese people have gradually realized that spitting is unhygienic! Also, in order to imitate the actions of foreigners, they changed from spitting all over the ground to spitting into handkerchiefs! Indeed, spitting all over the ground has the risk of spreading germs, but the phlegm on the ground will kill some germs after being exposed to sunlight. Those that have not been killed are dispersed in all directions by the dust, indirectly infecting people, and not everyone is necessarily infected. As for spitting into a handkerchief? The harm is even greater! After spitting, the spitter puts the handkerchief in his arms. After the body temperature evaporates, it dries immediately. At this time, the germs on the phlegm are clearly attached to the clothes. When the spitter takes it out for the second time, he folds the side that has been spit on. Between one fold and one stack, aren't the germs on the handkerchief immediately dispersed in the surrounding four, within the air? At this time, the person on the opposite side is invisibly exposed to the risk of direct infection between one breath and one word. At the same time, there is no place on the hands and thighs of the spitter that is free of germs. As long as his hand touches any object at will, the object will have the presence of germs. Isn't it becoming a medium for germs? How dangerous is it to be with such a germ-carrying person!</p>
<p>Of course, phlegm should be spit into a spittoon with sterilizing water. Putting down the spittoon and spitting into a handkerchief as a modern thing, isn't this harmful and self-harming modern thing blind obedience? You must know that spitting into a handkerchief is a last resort because you have to spit into a handkerchief when you encounter a place without a spittoon! But at least you have to bring a few more handkerchiefs. One handkerchief can only be used once, and it must be boiled with sterilizing water after use. I would like to ask how many people can do this in reality? I have seen people spitting into handkerchiefs, and one handkerchief is covered with thick phlegm! It is as hard as if it has been pasted with paste. They still continue to spit and even praise themselves as hygienic experts. This kind of hygiene can only be explained by himself.</p>
<p>Some people say that spitting all over the ground is like setting up cannons on the ground to bomb people. I think spitting into a handkerchief is like taking out a gun and shooting people in the face. Cannons bombing people doesn't mean everyone will be bombed. Shooting people with a gun means that the person on the opposite side can hardly escape. As for the two disasters, which is direct, which is indirect, which is inevitable, and which is accidental, it is not necessary to be wise to know it.</p>
<p>In short, not all foreign habits are worth learning. Blindly following others will always be greatly fooled, and spitting into a handkerchief is just one example!</p>
<h3>General Knowledge of Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(111) General Symptoms of Laryngeal Diseases</p>
<p>The general symptoms of laryngeal diseases are mainly three: (1) change in voice, (2) difficulty in breathing, and (3) coughing. These three symptoms are common occurrences in any type of laryngeal disease. I will elaborate on them separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Change in voice – The voice becomes turbid, impure, or loses its original tone when speaking. This is what is called hoarseness. In severe cases, it can lead to complete loss of voice, known as aphonia. In order to produce a normal voice, we must have four conditions: First, the airflow vibrating the vocal cords must have a certain strength and speed; Second, the glottis must be completely closed; Third, the vocal cords must be tense; Fourth, the vocal cords must vibrate freely. If the vocal cords themselves or their surroundings develop lesions, or if the movement system of the vocal cords is impaired, these four conditions will inevitably be incomplete, and the patient will experience changes in voice accordingly. This often occurs in cases of severe bodily weakness, vocal cord overuse, inflammatory congestion, infiltration, ulceration, tumor formation, and diseases of the vocal cord muscles and their motor nerves.</p>
<p>(2) Breathing difficulty – Breathing difficulty is mostly caused by narrowing of the larynx. Its main causes are generally swelling of the larynx or its surroundings, cellulitis, tumors (such as goiter, aortic aneurysm, or cancer), foreign bodies, laryngospasm, and paralysis of the glottis-opening muscles. If the breathing difficulty is mild, there is no apparent abnormality when at rest. Only during physical exertion or emotional excitement does shortness of breath occur. If the breathing difficulty reaches a high degree, there is a risk of suffocation and death.</p>
<p>(3) Cough – Coughing is also a common symptom of laryngeal diseases. Coughing can occur voluntarily or reflexively. When there is disease in the posterior wall of the larynx, the arytenoid cartilage folds, and the area below the vocal cords, it is easy to trigger persistent coughing attacks. If secretions are coughed up, it is called a wet cough; otherwise, it is called a dry cough. The tone of the cough varies, so there are distinctions such as hoarse, barking, metallic, flute-like, and silent coughs.</p>
<p>(112) Laryngitis</p>
<p>Laryngitis has both acute and chronic forms. However, based on clinical evidence, acute cases are more common, especially during the dry season of early winter. Therefore, I will focus on the acute form here.</p>
<p>The causes of acute laryngitis are generally chemical, mechanical, and thermal stimuli. For example, colds, overuse of the vocal cords, air containing dust or toxic gases, and excessive use of tobacco and alcohol can all cause this condition. Young men are most susceptible. Onset is often rapid, often accompanied by pharyngitis. Secretions increase. The voice becomes hoarse. The larynx itches. In severe cases, there is a burning sensation or sore throat. Sometimes, bloody sputum is coughed up, causing patients to panic, mistaking it for hemoptysis. If we examine the larynx with a laryngoscope, we will see general redness and swelling of the laryngeal mucosa, especially in the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, vocal cords, false vocal cords, and subglottic mucosa. In addition, vocal cord movement disorders often occur.</p>
<p>The treatment for acute laryngitis involves strictly avoiding stimulation from tobacco and alcohol, avoiding talking, cold, and dust. Regular bowel movements are also important. All drinks and foods should be warm. As for internal medications and local treatments, they must be prescribed and administered by a doctor for proper care.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Plants of National Origin (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The root contains crystalline purple pigment of Acetylahikonin Cr8Hr8O6.</p>
<p>Acetylshikonin, difficult to crystallize, is often extracted from the plant and alkalized to become Shikonin Cr6Hr6O5. The yield of the raw material is 0.015%.</p>
<p>The structural formula of Shikonin is as follows:</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Purple root extract is used in ointments for treating skin diseases. It is extremely effective for burns, frostbite, eczema, blisters, etc. The simplest way to use it is to mix finely powdered purple root with olive oil or sesame oil.</p>
<p>Old saying: Purple root is a wonderful medicine for cuts and burns. Decocted juice or heated in oil, and the dissolved substances are used for application.</p>
<p>(Other Uses) Used to be used as a purple dye. It is said that the one produced in southern Australia is the most famous. However, it fades easily when exposed to sunlight, which is its shortcoming. It is now rarely used as a dye.</p>
<h3>Introducing a New Type of Medical Publication (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shou Yuan</p>
<p>— Modern Medical Translation Series —</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it was already three or four years ago. That was when I was editing the medical and pharmaceutical supplement of the Chen Bao (Morning Post). At that time, I and my colleagues who wrote articles for the medical journal had a common feeling about the domestic medical and pharmaceutical publications: we thought that the content of most domestic medical journals was somewhat mediocre: too superficial for doctors to read, with little reference value; and honestly, too profound for the general public to understand. If we really want to do something for China's medical culture, it is necessary to expand our organization (we had a small organization at that time that hosted the medical journal, called the Public Medical and Pharmaceutical Society), gather medical colleagues who are interested in medical culture work, and roughly divide the medical publications into two levels, and jointly do some "two-level system" of textual work.</p>
<p>How to divide medical publications into two levels? What is the "two-level system" of medical writing?</p>
<p>We made the medical knowledge publications for the general public to read even more simple and popular, and tried our best to make the text and meaning of the text popular, so that the general public could understand and easily digest them. Because this is the work of imparting knowledge to the public. On the other hand, when we write medical articles for medical colleagues to refer to, we need to be more specialized; but not the specialization of simply copying old books, but specialized articles with fresh materials and insights from each person.</p>
<p>Regarding these two textual works, we also had a concrete plan at that time: for the former general indoctrination work, in addition to the existing medical supplements, we would reorganize them and plan to publish several kinds of popular series as medical knowledge reading materials for the general public; as for the latter's work policy, because it is specifically for medical colleagues to refer to, it seemed more difficult, so we turned the idea of ​​this textual work to the aspect of translation. Because if we ourselves run a medical magazine or other publications, to write fresh and insightful things on a regular basis, honestly, we don't have that much fresh material, and we don't have that many insightful texts to write. Translation is certainly a kind of introduction work. If we can gather some colleagues who understand the languages ​​of various countries, jointly subscribe to several copies of excellent medical publications from various advanced countries, and think about doing this job of introducing and translating matchmaking, it might be easier. If we can solicit comrades and improve the organization, we really want to run a publication for this specialized textual work, focusing on the introduction work of translation. This is indeed a very good kind of spiritual food for general clinical doctors. Isn't this a meaningful work that is unique?</p>
<p>However, the result was that, due to the limitations of various people's living environment, economic situation, talented comrades, and other such realistic conditions, this plan was never realized, and the idea was simply turned over and finished. When the Chen Bao (Morning Post) was suspended for some reason, even our original medical and pharmaceutical weekly column on that newspaper had to be declared "dead." Since then, our interest and enthusiasm for writing medical articles has also faded invisibly, and we have no more thoughts to think about or the courage to realize the various plans we initially made.</p>
<p>Recently, we received very satisfying unexpected good news. Not long ago, I received a new type of medical publication edited by Dr. Yang Yuanji, called "Modern Medical Translation Series." I hurriedly finished reading it, and then I immediately remembered this episode of three or four years ago. At the same time, after reading it, I had such a feeling: Dr. Yang's work is exactly in line with one of my ideal works a few years ago. This work is precisely what is urgently needed in the current medical field.</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>Shanghai Local Supplement of Shen Bao (Shanghai Daily)</p>
<p>Talking Point</p>
<h3>Doctors Have Started Soliciting Customers</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The large number of doctors in Shanghai can be seen from the signs hanging on various roads. Because there are many people in the medical profession, competition is inevitable in terms of business. The propaganda in the advertisements is naturally exaggerated. If you charge one dollar for an injection, I will offer a 50% discount and only charge 50 cents. If this family charges six dollars for delivery, that family will drastically reduce the price to four dollars. This situation seems to be very beneficial to patients. But in fact, it is not, it is precisely the misfortune of the patients.</p>
<p>However, although the business competition among hospitals is fierce, using the means of soliciting customers to grab business is a new fact that has only recently been discovered. A certain doctor specializes in hiring people to wait in front of major hospitals. When patients go to the hospital for treatment, they try to lure them away. This must be said to be a unique business technique. The impact of this is that the doctor's reputation will be damaged, and the patient will be greatly deceived.</p>
<p>The method of prevention should naturally be to strictly crack down on unlicensed hospitals. Because this kind of soliciting behavior is probably not something that legitimate doctors would do. Only some incompetent doctors can do it. Of course, even legitimate hospitals cannot guarantee that there are no people who only care about profit, but that is another matter.</p>
<p>However, the new fact that doctors are specializing in hiring people to solicit customers also shows the desolate situation of hospital business. Because the current market is affected by the economic downturn, and people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult. Most families cannot even maintain food and clothing, and they have no extra energy to take medicine when they are sick. This will greatly hit the general practitioners, and to the point that some people come out to grab business.</p>
<p>Prostitutes soliciting customers is common and not surprising. Now that doctors have also started soliciting customers, it is really strange. Running a hospital, instead of developing in a legitimate direction, actually uses the means of soliciting customers to grab business. It is possible that in the future, they will solicit from the road and solicit to the house, specializing in hiring people to seek patients from house to house.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Special Medicine "Kelinxing"</h3>
<p>Whether new or old leukorrhea, it can eliminate bacteria and eradicate the root</p>
<p>This product is the latest invention of medical experts. It has a high degree of bactericidal and disinfectant power. It is an authoritative agent for gonorrhea and leukorrhea. It cannot be compared with ordinary palliative treatment products on the market. As a result of clinical trials by a large number of famous doctors, it is recognized as the only effective medicine for gonorrhea. Whether it is acute or chronic gonorrhea, male or female, and various inflammations caused by gonorrhea that have not been cured for many years, taking "Kelinxing" will immediately show significant functions. This is because the permeability is extremely strong, and the turbid bacteria will die when they encounter it, so it can completely eradicate the root. Each box costs two yuan in national currency. It is sold at Zhengwei Pharmacy and San Gongsi on Er Ma Road.</p>
<h3>Frostbite Magic Medicine</h3>
<p>Unbroken ones eliminate swelling on the same day, and those that are rotten recover in a few days</p>
<p>Frostbite is a disease in which blood stasis congeals, initially showing redness and swelling, with unbearable pain and itching. After it has ulcerated, pus flows out, and the pain is even worse. This disease is especially common in winter, and there are few good remedies in the world, so patients suffer from it. Fortunately, Zhengwei Pharmacy (Yinghua Street intersection on Er Ma Road) has invented two kinds of magic medicines: (1) Frostbite Ruyi Water, which specializes in treating unbroken frostbite. Once tried, the pain and itching will stop immediately, and the redness and swelling will disappear immediately. (2) Pearl White Jade Ointment, which specializes in treating rotten frostbite. Once tried, it removes rot and promotes new growth, and recovers in a few days. The price of Ruyi Water is 20 cents per bottle, and the price of White Jade Ointment is 40 cents per box.</p>
<h3>Livelihood</h3>
<p>— Zheng Mingliao</p>
<p>The sky quickly darkened, it was already night. It was still raining incessantly, dripping, dripping, hitting the broken tin roof, and flowing down from the rotten holes in the broken tin roof, dripping down the wall, drop by drop, onto the floor. The floor was like a street, shining brightly, reflecting the faint green light of the street lamp shining in from outside. The scene was very scary, as if it were like that in the underworld—if it were really in the underworld, that would be good. Lin Sheng had been looking for death and life all day long, but his young wife held him back, and his own little boy, who had just learned to walk at a little over two years old, also cried and dragged him down. As a result, Lin Sheng only shed a face full of tears, saying to them in a kind of indescribable cruel and resentful voice: "Alas! What do I owe you? Tell me! Why should I suffer so much!" He wished he could slam his head against the wall and die. But saying it over and over again, the young wife still said the same unchanging sentence in her wailing: "You...you can't go this way...look at me...for the sake of the child...you can't go this way...it doesn't matter if we are poor...we don't complain even if we starve to death...you can't go this way..."</p>
<p>So, Lin Sheng's heart was like a spoonful of molten lead poured into it, bursting and aching unbearably. The two people pulled and tugged each other, still collapsed on that only broken chair, panting urgently, like a tiger exhausted from fighting, and now, exhausted, everything had reached a dead end, and there was no more strength and courage to continue living.</p>
<p>"We don't complain even if we starve to death!" This voice pierced Lin Sheng's heart, aching especially unbearably. Yes, the family, old and young, had not eaten anything for two days, and "starving to death" was not far away. Warm tears flowed slowly on Lin Sheng's cheeks. He didn't know what kind of mood he had at this time.</p>
<p>"But, can it really be that we starve to death while we are still young?" Seeing the woman and child groaning weakly in hunger, and himself, himself with a healthy body that won't die, what can't he do? Go steal, go rob, also……</p>
<p>Thinking about it, Lin Sheng fell asleep in extreme stimulation and decline. The night was already very deep, the wind was howling outside, rolling up the dead leaves in the dark half-air, and then letting them fall into the puddles on the ground, floating like a rudderless canoe broken by huge waves in the sea……</p>
<p>The next day it was still raining. When Lin Sheng woke up from his deep sleep at dawn, his heart was completely calm. Like a death row inmate who has made a decision, everything that is coming will eventually come, and distress is futile. Looking at his wife and child, their sallow faces all had the tranquil look of sound sleep. Everything from last night was simply like a past nightmare, except for the stomach</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The hunger pangs were aching, and his head was a little dizzy. He couldn't find any trace of misery.</p>
<p>Lin Sheng had already decided: the fate of their family would be decided on this day. This day, he had to find a livelihood no matter what, even if it meant risking his life, no matter what……</p>
<p>He quietly got up and opened the door. The street was cold and quiet. It was still early, and there were very few pedestrians on the road. The sesame cake shop was baking sesame cakes, and the aroma almost made people faint. In a money exchange shop across the street, the clerks were counting copper coins, wrapping them into bundles and stacking them on the counter.</p>
<p>Lin Sheng stared fiercely at them, and suddenly, his heart beat very fast, and even his hands trembled! Those copper coins! Baked cakes! Livelihood! Wife and child! Death……! Everything was flying in his head like a swarm of flies. His hands trembled even more, but finally, like a madman, he rushed over and punched the clerk counting copper coins in the face, and then grabbed ten or so bundles of copper coins and ran towards the distance of the street.</p>
<p>The street immediately became disturbed. The clerks in the shop shouted and chased, and a large crowd of people rushed after them. Finally, the police came. Three or four people intercepted Lin Sheng in the middle of the road, and then the police came up and beat him hard, and handcuffed his hands.</p>
<p>"Tell me, how many times have you done this? Tell me the truth!"</p>
<p>"Sir! Master! I have never done it before, this is the first time! Livelihood! This is the last decision for livelihood……!"</p>
<p>"The first time? Do you think we are children? Haha, you are so good at denying it! If we don't give you a hard time, you won't be willing to tell the truth, let's go!"</p>
<p>With a "slap," he was slapped on the face, and four policemen dragged Lin Sheng away like a live pig. The street was still raining, very muddy, and messy footprints were left on the cobblestone road, and not far away, Lin Sheng knew, all kinds of tortures were waiting for him……</p>
<h3>Mule Cart</h3>
<p>— Lu Zhi</p>
<p>Every morning I am always disturbed by the dull sound of that mule cart. The countryside is a bit scarily quiet. Because it is quiet, a wooden-wheeled cart can wake me up. And what is even more annoying is the hoarse voice of the old man driving the cart:</p>
<p>"Damn it, you little devil, see if you get the whip. ……"</p>
<p>The sound of the whip was not heard hitting the mule, but was replaced by a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>That old man was nearly sixty years old. Squinting eyes, beard like weeds, face purplish-red, covered with gray-white beard, looking like Santa Claus, but he always seemed to be frowning, never smiling.</p>
<p>That mule was the same, so thin that its hock bones were like two horns standing on its hind legs, its head was always lowered listlessly, but it had the strength to endure. After the old man scolded it, it still dragged the rickety cart step by step.</p>
<p>The roads in the countryside are really difficult to walk, especially on rainy days. When you step on it with one foot, the mud immediately surrounds your foot. When you try to pull up your left foot, your right foot sinks even deeper. So when it rained at night, or when it was raining, the sound of the cart wheels was gone, but the old man's scolding was denser and louder. Also at this time, the sound of the whip was heard on the mule's back.</p>
<p>I hated it, and sometimes I was so angry that I put on my clothes and went to the window, wanting to curse him a few times. I tried a few times, but when I saw the old man wearing a torn piece of clothing, wearing a straw hat with a hole in it, holding the reins in one hand, and shaking the other hand and half of his body in the air, the cursing words always rolled back into my stomach. So early, the east was only a little white, the stars were shining high, and he had to drive the cart out. This scene made me unable to scold him. I stood blankly in front of the window, watching him try to drive the mule over the uneven road, to find food for him and the mule. Although I knew that if I got up at this time, I would have a headache all day today. I have a very bad habit, I can't sleep anymore once I get up in the morning. A day's work has no free time, just like that mule, working from morning to night.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I had dinner around one or two o'clock, this old man would drive the cart back again. When driving the cart back, I often only heard the sound of the wheels rolling over the uneven road. He rarely scolded the mule. But sometimes, maybe business was bad, and the sound of the whip was very loud in the night sky.</p>
<p>The old man really only had him and the mule left. No children. One time he came back very early, and had eaten some wine, probably because business was good. I and two colleagues talked to him. He stopped the cart and shook his head on the driving platform. It was also at this time that I saw his eyes, which were full of sorrow. Even in this moment of triumph, he couldn't get rid of his sorrow.</p>
<p>"I have several children, the oldest would be... (he counted) nearly forty now, and the youngest would be twenty years old. ... I feel a little regret now, I didn't have a daughter, they are all boys, four, you gentlemen think, how blessed... Several of them have gone to eat rations, and they left and never came back, leaving me, this dry old man, and this mule. It is this mule that is so hard to keep. Those who eat rations wanted to pull it away. I hid it in a mountain cave. Really, I think about it now, I shouldn't have let my children go to eat rations. What Sun Marshal, Lu Marshal, have gold and silver, but I, an old man, only have a bare body now. I still rely on this mule. It is more useful than my sons! ... It's not early, gentlemen, I'm going to let this animal graze!" As he said this, he drove the cart away again.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I think of this gray-haired little mule, I congratulate it. It has the old man's love, but we work like mules from day to night, only having emptiness and loneliness.</p>
<p>I endured the sound of the mule cart for half a year, and now I haven't heard the sound of wooden wheels and the old man's scolding with love for a long time, and I feel lonely. Is he still healthy now?</p>
<h3>A Farm Scene</h3>
<p>— Luo</p>
<p>Winter brings a delightful sun.</p>
<p>On the threshing ground, tall stacks of firewood have already been piled high. It's another year of bountiful harvest, temporarily easing the farmers' furrowed brows that have been locked tight for a year. However, the daily trips to town to inquire about "market prices" leave a dreadful impression deep in their hearts! "Grain prices are worthless!" Perhaps they mourn the ox they sold off and become sorrowful.</p>
<p>Sparrows, like little children, hop and skip around on the threshing ground. They have been waiting somewhere, somehow, for a year, and now, shaking their mottled hemp clothing, their pointed yellow beaks peck at each pure white grain of rice, a sumptuous feast!</p>
<p>In the fields, rice roots remain, clump after clump, so neatly arranged, letting the sun shine everywhere. Standing on the field and looking ahead, the field ridges resemble waistbands, cinching the square fields, extending all the way to the edge of the sky; there, pale gray clouds float.</p>
<p>Far away by the riverbank, there is a cart shed for oxen, newly thatched with fresh reeds, glistening in the sun. Inside the shed, it is quiet and still, with only the creaking sound of the wind passing through the pulley. The old ox, toiling tirelessly all year round, is tethered beneath a tree—now is its time to rest. It has just finished a hearty meal of reeds, turning its long, slender eyes towards the shed, perhaps wondering, after drawing water for so many years, enduring so many whips from the herdboy, how it can't escape this narrow shed?</p>
<p>Under the sun, the farm women sit in a sheltered spot. Some are mending clothes for their children, others are weaving new straw shoes for their husbands to wear to town. In their hearts, they also harbor a hope, hoping that the price of rice will rise, so that when they sell at a good price, they can buy a fashionable new dress for the New Year. This hope has been there for more than a year or two; they are still wearing the clothes they wore when they got married!</p>
<p>Naturally, the happiest are the children. They pester their mothers for fried broad beans, and everyone takes a handful, hides them in their pockets, and gathers in the corner of the threshing ground to draw tortoise shell diagrams, using the broad beans to wager.</p>
<p>Under this delightful sun, we have not seen a single farmer spend a leisurely afternoon there, only white-haired old men smoking cheap dry tobacco, reminiscing about their golden age!</p>
<p>Those farmers whose skin has been tanned purple by the venomous summer sun now gather in small teahouses in the market towns, hoping to turn each grain they planted into money to repay debts, celebrate the New Year, and buy a new dress for their wives at a satisfying "market price." Their hearts, like the pulley in the cart shed, spin endlessly.</p>
<p>The sun, after a day's journey, is sent back by the crows' cawing, and wisps of black smoke rise from the thatched roofs of every house. Another day passes, and the New Year draws closer.</p>
<h3>The Wife Has Gone to Be a Wet Nurse</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Jingxia</p>
<h3>In the Carriage</h3>
<p>— Luo Yu</p>
<p>The early spring air, trapped inside the carriage, mingled with the pungent smell of cigarettes, becoming stifling.</p>
<p>Their bodies, tossed about by the high speed, were squeezed between two reclining seats. The afternoon sun peeked through the window, trembling restlessly, teasing their hands and knees, then shifting from one face to another.</p>
<p>At the doorway, a young man in a railway uniform greeted his colleague in the gentle accent of Tangshan, then calmly walked back into the carriage. He walked to the side of three women.</p>
<p>"Who was that you were talking to?"</p>
<p>"A colleague nearby, also from the same hometown."</p>
<p>The woman, who looked to be in her forties, answered the man in uniform. She had the compassionate face of a missionary, and a pair of ever-compassionate eyes. Those eyes tirelessly searched among the mountains and trees, as if seeing some buried happiness there.</p>
<p>"Aunt? Take a look over there. My father works in that town." The young man had sat down to her right, pointing towards the foot of the distant mountain by the window, and spoke like this. There was a blurry cedar forest over there, with a layer of miasma lingering, and a dark boundary underneath, with the roofs of pine houses vaguely visible at one end.</p>
<p>Three pairs of eyes longingly looked over.</p>
<p>The young man's face, recently shaven, looked very bright in front of the window. He had a pair of prominent large eyes, and a slightly protruding mouth, making him look like an alert and careful young man. He kept flashing a few smiles, gazing at the delicate face of the bride across from him.</p>
<p>She was his newly married wife, and they were about to settle down in a new town at the end of the railway line ahead.</p>
<p>The woman dressed in bright clothes looked constantly worried and didn't talk much, sitting there thinking. The reflection from the carriage roof shone on her powdered face, creating a trembling purple color. Her younger brother was sleeping on her lap. Her mother, a fat woman, buried her face in her left shoulder, snoring heavily.</p>
<p>"We'll be home before dark," the young man in uniform said to himself, as if comforting her, stretching his back.</p>
<p>"Call Peng-ge when you get home and have him come see us tonight," the aunt said to the young man, her eyes brushing over the reddish-brown rocky slopes.</p>
<p>"He can't come. Are you hoping he'll come with the train tonight?" The man paused for a moment and said, "That colleague just told me that Peng-ge has gone to the hospital."</p>
<p>"What, does that mean his illness has gotten worse?!" The anxious mother asked. The man paused for a moment and said:</p>
<p>"His numbness is unchanged, (but his right hand is completely unable to move after getting angry). That colleague said his eyesight is failing. One time, his sister-in-law hit his head against the wall, making him unable to raise his hand, and then his eyes started having problems. He saw him at the station one evening, and asked, 'Why don't you go home?' But he didn't answer the first question. When he looked again, he realized that he was struggling there, waiting in pain; he only said, 'I can't see clearly anymore, older brother'." He stopped there, seeing the change in the aunt's face, an expression of restraint after prolonged sobbing.</p>
<p>"But luckily, Stationmaster Gangtian is treating him well, asking him to do less work, and also helping him treat his eyes, and there are also fellow villagers."</p>
<p>The aunt seemed to be falling into a dreamlike impasse, her lips trembling, wanting to say something, but it was very difficult.</p>
<p>At this moment, the woman across from her suddenly spoke.</p>
<p>"I heard that sister-in-law has been to school."</p>
<p>This sentence made the aunt very uneasy. But the husband answered with his youthful frankness:</p>
<p>"Studied? Even if there was such a thing, it wouldn't change her nature. She's just arguing with brother-in-law for no reason. Mom always says brother-in-law has a really good temper: he says there are so many girls around the railway, but he just happened to meet this female fortress owner, and she even gave brother-in-law several letters."</p>
<p>The bride smiled when she heard this; then she drooped her eyelids again with a faint sadness. She looked even more worried than before.</p>
<p>The aunt kept listening attentively to the conversation between the two young ones, but she kept her eyes fixed on the woman's fair face, which made her both bury her head and blush.</p>
<p>A deep sadness flashed through the aunt's eyes. She felt very flustered for a moment, seeing something dazzling flowing on that fair but not very beautiful female face.</p>

<p>China-West (1040) 1 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "National Heroes" (By Gao Yangshanren)</p>
<p>The situation fluctuates and opinions vary. The people's morale declines and foreign powers are strong. China originally rose from the Kunlun Mountains. Moving east from the Xia and Shang dynasties. The Zhou Dynasty lasted eight hundred years. Conferring titles on the royal family to the four borders. The Central Plains gradually expanded. The barbarians were reduced to wasteland. There were many miracles in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. The Qin Dynasty unified through conquest. The tyranny was truly autocratic. Liu Bang rose up by slaying the serpent. Seeking justice for the people to destroy Qin and Chu. Relying only on Han Xin, Xiao He, and Zhang Liang. Transmitting the throne for five generations to establish the emperor. At that time, the Eastern Kou Hui were very powerful and violent. Raping, plundering, and doing everything. Coastal residents lacked peace and prosperity. Fertile land became desolate. A thousand miles of plains became a wasteland. National heroes rose in time. Appointing generals and ministers like Huo Guang. Killing them so that their ships were broken, their masts were destroyed, and their heads fell. Their souls scattered and fled to the ocean. From then on, the border people enjoyed peace and prosperity. There is still a temple on the coast today. The name of the great general is known far and wide. His fame will last ten thousand ages.</p>
<p>He Yunfang, He Qinfang "Double Pearl Ball"</p>
<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM</p>
<p>Opening "New Opening on Wealth, Nobility, Poverty, and Lowliness"</p>
<p>All are born after ten months of pregnancy. Heaven is extremely fair. Who knows that the social situation changes? Distinguishing between wealth, nobility, poverty, and lowliness, importance and lightness. The wealthy have limitless wealth that is difficult to calculate. Gold, silver, and jewels fill boxes. Numerous high halls and large houses. Calling servants and prostitutes to cook food and drink. Buying good fields and taking the rent. Regardless of the bankruptcy of farmers who want to resort to violence. The noble have power and influence to deceive others. Completely disregarding reason and reputation. Never thinking that snow pillars and ice mountains are difficult to last. Their family property will be sacrificed in the future. The most bitter is the situation of the common people, who are extremely poor. No way to appeal and making no sound. Exhausting all efforts to maintain, with depleted mental and physical strength. It is pitiful to have land but not be able to cultivate it. Some suddenly have suicidal thoughts due to failure. Hanging themselves or jumping into the water to end their lives. I think that Confucius of Mount Ni was unmatched. He said that equality means no poverty, which is very clear. Unfortunately, no one follows this. Resulting in a division of classes into disgrace and honor. In the future, after equality and freedom. Treating everyone as brothers equally. Only then can we see a clear world.</p>
<p>Jiang Binchu "Three Smiles"</p>
<p>New Sound (1380) 7 PM to 8 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Yun San's Suicide"</p>
<p>Red Mansion Dreams speak of absurdity. Unlucky beauties are very sad. Yun Sanjie has, a moon-like face and flower-like appearance, with an iron-like heart. Relying on others to helplessly spend her years. Meeting Liu Lang, a talented and romantic man. Named Xiang Lian, with a strong personality. They are, as if they had known each other before. Giving a treasure to seal their marriage. Considered to be. A talented man and a beautiful woman, an unparalleled couple. Entrusting their lives to each other forever. Who knows, a storm suddenly arises out of nowhere. Slanderous words enter her ears and regret is difficult to bear. Liu Lang demands back the mandarin duck sword. Sanjie, her heart aches to the point of breaking. Drawing out the green blade, it flashes like lightning. Pointlessly committing suicide on the spot. Peach blossom blood splatters on her clothes. Startling Xiang Lian into losing his composure. From then on, he let his hair grow long and went into the mountains to cultivate the Dao. Eliminating worldly obstacles to answer San Niang. The twelve golden hairpins are all enchanting. Only San Niang has a strong personality. A mound of yellow earth buries Hengtang.</p>

<h3>Beauty</h3>
<p>"Eternal Smile" Theme Song</p>
<p>Green willows under Zijin Mountain,</p>
<p>Iron hooves and silver bells,</p>
<p>Accompany the singing of beauty, every sound passing by the future,</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers of the Qinhuai River are cold,</p>
<p>Pale moon and sparse stars,</p>
<p>Causing beauty to worry, every thought reaching dawn.</p>
<p>Beauty, like beautiful people, a deep affection,</p>
<p>Knowing me is like the green willow,</p>
<p>Suffering for you, bitterness is also willing.</p>
<p>Beauty, like beautiful people, a deep affection,</p>
<p>Knowing me is like the clear water,</p>
<p>Dying for you, death is also peaceful.</p>
<p>According to this song, it was written by Zeng Yan and has been composed by the film director Wu Cun, sung by the lead actress Hu Die, and recorded by the Baidai Company.</p>
<h3>"Midnight Song" Cast</h3>
<p>The candidates for the main roles in "Midnight Song" are Jin Shan, Gu Er'yi, Shi Chao, Xiao Ying, Gu Menghu, etc. for the male role, and Hu Ping, Zhou Wenzhu, Xu Manli, Chen Yun, etc. for the female role. All are very famous and well-accomplished artists. Hu Ping is expected to play a daughter of a wealthy family who has suffered deep trauma. The internal performance in several scenes is beautiful, giving people a sense of sadness, purity, and beauty, creating a unique style.</p>
<h3>"Little Aunt" Chen Qixia</h3>

Others such as Fei Mu's "Spring Boudoir Broken Dream" and Cai Chusheng's "Little Five Righteous", are in production.</p>
<p>Wang Cilong's "Lonely City Martyr" has been completed. The sound, light, acting skills are excellent. In the film, Chen Yanyan and Han Langen both play peddlers. Yanyan sells peanuts, Han sells spiced tea eggs, and speaks Shandong dialect, with many gimmicks.</p>
<p>He Mengfu's "Daughter of the General" has been very busy with filming in recent days. The scene of the secret underground room of the party members is ingenious in structure and cannot be handled without those familiar with revolutionary work.</p>
<p>Shen Fu's "Match Made in Heaven" is now four-fifths complete, and most of it will be completed soon. Han Langen has as many gimmicks as Chaplin in "Modern Times". Filming has been temporarily suspended due to Bai Lang's illness.</p>
<p>Tan Youliu directed the "Stormy Night" segment in "United China Symphony", developing the greed of a miser. Because of his habit of loving money as his life, he unknowingly released the enemy who killed his only son. Zheng Junli, Bai Lu, and Liu Qiong co-star.</p>
<p>He Mengfu directed "Moonlit Landscape" in "United China Symphony" using a sketch method. The famous ancient musician Sha Mei composed the music. The song title "Our Home" has a tragic and strong spirit, and will be collected into a record by Shambart Company.</p>
<p>Sun Yu directed the "Madman's Rhapsody" in "United China Symphony". Shan Shangwu played a mad farmer, acting extremely hard, and therefore achieved excellent results.</p>
